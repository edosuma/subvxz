WEBVTT

00:09.199 --> 00:12.319
- Stargate in motion.
- Chevron six encoded.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.925
Better hang on to something,
Mr. Secretary.

00:17.919 --> 00:21.039
This is how we open
the front door around here.

00:22.079 --> 00:24.071
Chevron seven locked.

00:28.559 --> 00:32.143
- My God, General, it's...
- I thought you might be impressed.

00:32.079 --> 00:34.652
What exactly am I looking at?

00:34.639 --> 00:38.304
We think it's the event horizon
of an artificially created wormhole

00:38.238 --> 00:43.862
through our space-time to a point tens,
even hundreds, of light years away... sir.

00:45.119 --> 00:46.033
Uh-huh.

00:46.081 --> 00:49.698
SG-5, the mission is go
for standard recon.

00:49.640 --> 00:54.847
- And do we know where they're going?
- The planet's designation is P3C-117.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.459
- Do you have any idea what's out there?
- No, sir.

00:59.399 --> 01:01.938
That would be why we're going.

01:01.918 --> 01:06.462
I'm not sure, Colonel. Is it?
Because, to be perfectly Frank,

01:06.359 --> 01:11.317
this administration is not satisfied with
the progress of the Stargate programme.

01:11.799 --> 01:16.462
Begging the secretary's pardon, sir, but
we've already visited 19 separate worlds.

01:16.359 --> 01:20.605
I believe he is referring specifically
to the volume of technology

01:20.519 --> 01:23.722
being retrieved on our planetary missions.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.634
The president was under
the impression that the SG teams

01:26.597 --> 01:29.219
would be bringing back
superior technologies.

01:29.198 --> 01:31.606
I'm sorry, I thought we were explorers.

01:31.599 --> 01:35.597
Oh, you are. But even Marco Polo,
when he came back from the Far East,

01:35.520 --> 01:38.521
brought more than just a few...
exotic spices.

01:38.479 --> 01:41.646
Mr. Secretary, it's been my observation

01:41.599 --> 01:45.977
that, whether it's here
on Earth or... out there,

01:45.879 --> 01:50.671
cultures with advanced technology
tend not to like to share it.

01:50.558 --> 01:53.594
- So, we're wasting our time.
- Would you interpret what I...

01:53.560 --> 01:55.219
Colonel.

01:55.239 --> 01:57.197
Sir, with respect,

01:57.198 --> 02:00.983
this programme is quite probably
humanity's most important endeavour.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.418
They said the same thing about Apollo.
They brought back moon rocks.

02:04.359 --> 02:07.277
We haven't been to the moon in 25 years.

02:07.239 --> 02:09.646
What kind of comparison is that?

02:09.639 --> 02:12.475
If a Goa'uld ship
were coming here right now,

02:12.438 --> 02:16.021
have you brought back one thing
we can fight them off with?

02:17.879 --> 02:20.038
What technologies do you seek?

02:21.240 --> 02:23.944
You tell me. What's out there?

02:26.280 --> 02:29.730
There are still technologies
even the Goa'uld seek.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.716
There is a creature that lives on
an unpopulated world.

02:32.679 --> 02:35.514
It possesses powers of invisibility.

02:35.479 --> 02:38.314
Invisibility? As in Stealth?

02:38.680 --> 02:42.807
That is correct.
It can appear or disappear at will.

02:42.719 --> 02:47.299
I was once commanded to retrieve
the creature, to learn its secrets.

02:47.918 --> 02:53.673
Apophis took the lives of two of my men
as punishment for failure to retrieve it.

02:53.519 --> 02:57.765
If we capture one alive, it could provide us
with a serious tactical advantage

02:57.680 --> 03:00.764
the next time we came up
against the Goa'uld.

03:00.719 --> 03:03.008
Sounds like a mission to me.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.348
Carter!

03:30.079 --> 03:32.485
Daniel! Teal'c!

03:34.479 --> 03:36.555
Here, sir.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.500
What have we got?

03:41.519 --> 03:45.102
I thought I saw something
just as we came through, sir.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.614
Teal'c, did we score already?

03:47.599 --> 03:50.719
I saw movement as well. This way.

03:52.639 --> 03:55.176
I hope these things are
as big as you say they are.

03:55.158 --> 03:58.741
There's enough tranquilliser in these darts
to knock out a rhino.

03:58.679 --> 04:01.965
They are very large,
but extremely manoeuvrable in the air.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.626
We'll find them most vulnerable
when they hover.

04:04.598 --> 04:07.090
Like a hummingbird?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.156
With teeth.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.990
All right. Well, there's nothing out here.
Let's get back to the gear...

04:21.560 --> 04:23.636
Where's the Stargate?

05:28.759 --> 05:31.297
I don't like this.

05:31.278 --> 05:34.362
- Did this ever happen to you before?
- It has not.

05:34.319 --> 05:39.360
If we needed to locate the Stargate,
we had a Goa'uld homing device to find it.

05:39.238 --> 05:42.358
- Do we have a homing device?
- Of course we do.

05:42.321 --> 05:45.819
- It's with the gear.
- Which is... by the Stargate.

05:45.759 --> 05:50.338
Yep. Captain, let's start a box search.
You and Teal'c take off in that direction.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.360
Stay in radio contact.
Daniel, you're with me.

06:02.119 --> 06:04.194
Psst! Pssst!

06:08.319 --> 06:09.269
There.

06:23.199 --> 06:28.786
I hope it becomes visible once we trank it,
otherwise we'll never be able to find it.

06:36.761 --> 06:41.055
- Teal'c, what the hell are you doin'?
- It did not come from me.

07:00.399 --> 07:02.559
You are certain it was Apophis?

07:02.560 --> 07:05.348
- Oh, yeah.
- OK, what are we gonna do?

07:05.319 --> 07:08.403
- We have to do something.
- That's not our mission.

07:08.358 --> 07:11.976
Forget our mission. He's the only one
who knows where Sha're and Skaara are.

07:11.918 --> 07:14.375
We may not get another chance like this.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.994
- What kind of entourage will he have?
- Two or three Jaffa personal guard.

07:22.119 --> 07:25.951
Are we seriously entertaining
the idea of going after Apophis?

07:25.879 --> 07:29.923
We're not prepared for an attack.
Half our ordnance is tranquilliser guns.

07:29.839 --> 07:31.963
So we use one of them to knock him out.

07:31.959 --> 07:35.209
He will wake up in a holding cell
without his technology.

07:35.159 --> 07:39.822
He will tell us everything about Goa'uld
technology, about where Sha're is.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.721
Can I remind you that
we don't know where the Stargate is?

07:42.680 --> 07:44.886
He will have the homing device I spoke of.

07:44.879 --> 07:47.168
There you are.

07:47.158 --> 07:49.733
You know what we're up against
better than anyone.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.007
Can we do what Daniel is talking about?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.783
We have the element of surprise.
I have my staff weapon.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.420
If we eliminate his personal guard
quickly, I believe so.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.468
Teal'c, this character
used to be a God to you.

08:05.439 --> 08:07.930
You sure you're OK with this?

08:08.920 --> 08:11.245
I am OK.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.947
OK. Carter?

08:14.319 --> 08:17.439
If we do this, we'd better
plan the attack carefully.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.735
Colonel!

09:34.479 --> 09:38.062
Teal'c. Jaffa shol'va!

09:53.799 --> 09:55.875
Tal shaka mel.

09:57.559 --> 09:59.635
I die free.

11:03.558 --> 11:06.761
- What are you looking at?
- I felt that blast kill me.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.717
I thought I... I thought we were dead.
Weren't we dead?

11:10.639 --> 11:12.548
Yeah.

11:12.559 --> 11:16.889
OK. Well, I thought heaven
would be a little more upscale.

11:16.799 --> 11:18.875
Oh, I don't think this is heaven.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.916
<i>Jack.</i>

11:30.360 --> 11:32.269
- Jack.
- What?!

11:32.279 --> 11:34.403
- It's OK.
- What the hell was that?

11:34.399 --> 11:36.475
It's OK.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.571
- Wasn't I just...
- Killed.

11:44.479 --> 11:47.349
- Killed as in... dead.
- Dead. Yeah, we know.

11:47.320 --> 11:50.238
We saw it happen.
Same thing happened to us.

11:51.519 --> 11:53.346
Well...

11:53.360 --> 11:55.649
This is a surprise, then.

11:55.640 --> 12:00.764
- I don't know what happened to Teal'c.
- Colonel, my side arm's gone.

12:00.639 --> 12:02.014
So's mine.

12:11.158 --> 12:13.235
Uh, hello.

12:23.720 --> 12:29.840
Hi, I'm Daniel... Jackson.
This is Captain Carter and this is, uh...

12:29.679 --> 12:31.673
Colonel Jack O'Neill, SG-1.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.028
Um...

12:34.639 --> 12:39.798
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
but we were... dead.

12:42.919 --> 12:46.703
D'you know where our friend is,
another like us?

13:04.320 --> 13:06.110
Is this your village?

13:06.120 --> 13:08.196
Arush? Talkee?

13:10.559 --> 13:13.051
We need to find our friend Teal'c.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.759
<i>Ah.</i>

13:24.759 --> 13:26.836
Fruit.

13:27.840 --> 13:32.217
Nothing like coming back
from the dead to build up an appetite.

13:33.719 --> 13:35.841
Oh, thank you.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.915
Very much.

13:46.198 --> 13:48.274
Did you do this?

13:49.519 --> 13:51.596
Did you heal us?

13:56.480 --> 13:59.018
I think they're a family.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.956
Of what?

14:00.960 --> 14:03.035
I have no idea.

14:04.679 --> 14:07.764
Well, we should ask them
to give us back our weapons.

14:11.719 --> 14:14.636
Hi. Um... Listen...

14:15.759 --> 14:22.129
Those things you found on us,
those... things you took from us...

14:23.440 --> 14:26.690
the big things,
they're very dangerous and...

14:28.479 --> 14:30.139
Hey.

14:30.798 --> 14:32.875
Teal'c. Thank God.

14:35.999 --> 14:39.368
Please tell me you know
what's going on around here.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.312
I cannot tell you that.

14:41.318 --> 14:43.941
What about Apophis?
You got a line on him?

14:43.918 --> 14:44.999
I do not.

14:45.039 --> 14:48.125
Any idea how far away
from the Stargate we might be?

14:48.080 --> 14:50.155
I believe it's...

14:52.879 --> 14:54.373
Nafrayu.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.990
Nafrayu.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.743
Carter.

15:01.198 --> 15:03.109
Carter.

15:05.159 --> 15:07.650
No. You can't keep him.

15:27.600 --> 15:32.096
- You should ask 'em about the Stargate.
- I have. They don't understand.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.705
Actually, they don't really say much at all.

15:34.679 --> 15:37.302
I'm trying to figure out if they're human.

15:37.279 --> 15:41.692
- They're fairly human.
- I will take you to your doorway.

15:43.038 --> 15:44.498
Whoa.

15:47.519 --> 15:49.725
You understand what I'm saying?

15:49.720 --> 15:52.721
It took time to learn your speech.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.236
Not much time.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.701
Your weapons... are gone.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.436
Gone where?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.076
You know about our enemy?

16:06.440 --> 16:09.475
The bad guys? They'll be following us.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.274
- You attacked them.
- You saw?

16:13.239 --> 16:15.610
We only meant to capture him.

16:15.599 --> 16:20.177
Look, um... we're not
in the assassination business.

16:22.279 --> 16:26.111
He's just... bad. He's very...

16:26.960 --> 16:28.668
- Bad.
- ...bad.

16:28.679 --> 16:31.549
We wanted to take him to our world
and have a chat with him

16:31.519 --> 16:35.184
about all the nasty, bad things
he's been doing.

16:36.239 --> 16:38.990
We just didn't know about
this force-field deal.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.629
I had never seen such a device. If I had...

16:41.599 --> 16:46.640
It's all right. We're alive.
Thanks to you folks.

16:47.360 --> 16:51.441
We will take you to your doorway.
You will go.

16:51.879 --> 16:55.581
- As in Stargate?
- Yes. You will go?

16:55.519 --> 16:58.889
Well, it's not quite that simple.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.756
By rescuing us, you have
placed yourselves in danger.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.970
- Apophis will try to locate us.
- Rest now.

17:04.919 --> 17:08.252
You will leave soon.
Take your ways with you.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.108
<i>No, wait, wait.</i>

17:12.319 --> 17:15.440
You helped us. You saved us.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.916
Yes.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.567
- How?
- Our ways.

17:21.999 --> 17:27.751
We're from a race of people that want to
learn about your ways, your medicine.

17:28.239 --> 17:29.817
No.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.540
Is there anyone else we could talk to?
Do you have a leader?

17:33.480 --> 17:36.564
- They have no wish to see you.
- So there are others?

17:36.519 --> 17:38.596
You will go.

17:40.919 --> 17:43.161
Right. We'll go.

17:43.839 --> 17:47.125
If you wish us to leave,
should we not depart now?

17:48.838 --> 17:51.792
Your brother won't revive until later.

17:53.798 --> 17:56.715
Excuse me? Whose brother?

18:01.559 --> 18:03.220
<i>Brother?</i>

18:25.039 --> 18:27.328
He resisted our attempts
to help him heal.

18:27.319 --> 18:30.984
He may yet survive. The Goa'uld
he carries is healing him even now.

18:30.919 --> 18:33.410
- That is good.
- How is that good?

18:34.039 --> 18:36.875
I mean, he's in the service of the Goa'uld.

18:37.799 --> 18:41.298
- He is like him.
- He's with us.

18:41.519 --> 18:45.847
Perhaps you can convince
the injured one to join you as well.

18:45.759 --> 18:47.836
Oh, I don't think so.

18:47.838 --> 18:50.080
The Goa'ulds are a parasitic race.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.701
They take life and use it
for their own purposes.

18:52.681 --> 18:55.468
And their ways are not like
your ways, believe me.

18:55.439 --> 18:58.772
- They do not know the Nox.
- That's you?

18:59.959 --> 19:01.867
The Nox?

19:01.881 --> 19:04.549
The ones you speak of
come to hunt the Fenri.

19:04.519 --> 19:05.300
Fenri?

19:05.359 --> 19:09.440
That's probably that disappearing,
invisible, flying thing we were after.

19:09.359 --> 19:11.602
Yes, Fenri.

19:12.559 --> 19:16.770
All right, look, um... Do you have
any elders I could speak with?

19:16.680 --> 19:22.598
- I don't think you're understanding...
- Ohper is one of the eldest of the Nox.

19:23.598 --> 19:28.509
If Shak'l does not die, they will be in
even greater danger than they are now.

19:29.919 --> 19:34.380
- There will be no more death.
- I have no intention of killing him.

19:34.278 --> 19:38.277
But if Shak'l survives his injuries,
he will tell the Goa'uld where to find you.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.318
Look, obviously your medicine is very...

19:42.160 --> 19:44.615
well, it's very effective.

19:44.599 --> 19:48.265
- But how do you defend yourselves?
- We don't.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.201
At least let us help you
in exchange for what you did for us.

19:51.159 --> 19:53.234
You must go.

19:54.919 --> 19:56.875
Right.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.585
Well, for now we'll just go over here.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.476
Excuse me.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.978
All right, do you know this Shak'l?

20:12.959 --> 20:16.708
He served in my command
when I was first prime of Apophis.

20:16.640 --> 20:21.219
We can't just walk away. If we hadn't
attacked Apophis, he wouldn't be here.

20:21.121 --> 20:23.196
And we can't kill him either.

20:25.640 --> 20:29.637
I wasn't considering it.
I was just stating a fact.

20:29.559 --> 20:34.269
We'll take Shak'l back. It's not as good
as having Apophis, but he can't stay here.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.859
Apophis will not allow us
to leave this world alive.

20:37.798 --> 20:41.583
You have challenged him
and I have betrayed him.

20:41.519 --> 20:45.184
Even if we locate the Stargate,
leaving this world will be difficult.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.869
We're back to square one.
We can't leave Shak'l here

20:47.839 --> 20:52.050
and we'll never get him back to the gate
without running into Apophis.

20:51.960 --> 20:56.288
We'll try and find out as much as we can
about the Nox. It's part of why we're here.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.865
In the meantime, I think
you'd better check on your friend.

20:59.799 --> 21:04.794
Whatever we end up doing, I don't think
he's gonna wake up in a very good mood.

21:11.839 --> 21:13.713
Apophis, kree.

21:13.719 --> 21:15.378
Shal tak.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.314
Teal'c was standing before me,
waiting to pay the price of his betrayal.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.156
- I had him in my hand!
- We have searched.

21:22.798 --> 21:25.171
Where are the others?

21:25.159 --> 21:27.827
Where is Shak'l?

21:27.799 --> 21:30.919
I saw them die.
They could not just disappear.

21:32.599 --> 21:35.932
Unless they have learned
the power of the beast.

21:39.239 --> 21:41.646
Must he be bound so tightly?

21:41.641 --> 21:44.557
If not, he will escape when he awakens.

21:45.079 --> 21:48.079
He deceives you. He's awake now.

21:55.798 --> 21:59.214
Were you waiting for me
to turn my back, Shak'l?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.236
As you taught me.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.036
Have you come to kill me?

22:05.641 --> 22:08.132
I offer you the chance to join me.

22:09.118 --> 22:11.871
- The Goa'uld are not gods.
- Lies.

22:12.118 --> 22:14.953
These people are that
of the first world. The Tauri.

22:14.919 --> 22:17.539
You waste your breath.

22:17.519 --> 22:22.015
I shall rest, strengthened by
the thought of the reward I shall get

22:21.920 --> 22:25.336
when I present your head to Apophis.

22:26.160 --> 22:31.154
The time of Apophis will soon end
and on that day I will return to our world

22:31.039 --> 22:33.413
and offer freedom to all Jaffa.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.029
It is a shame you will not live to see it,

22:36.999 --> 22:41.246
for when you fail to kill me,
it will be your head.

22:44.839 --> 22:47.461
I really don't get the point of this.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.309
If we run into Apophis again,
we'll be prepared.

22:50.278 --> 22:53.445
What good are bows and arrows
against that kind of fire power?

22:53.398 --> 22:56.185
<i>- Exactly how I want him to think.
- Yeah...</i>

22:56.160 --> 22:58.912
Any weapon's better than no weapon.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.369
- You guys just don't wanna give up.
- No.

23:01.358 --> 23:03.849
It happens when you end up
in Special Forces.

23:03.838 --> 23:08.002
- I don't think we make very good Nox.
- I think you're right.

23:09.479 --> 23:11.471
Is that a weapon?

23:11.479 --> 23:13.352
Yes.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.435
And you can't have it.

23:32.358 --> 23:37.152
If you blunted this tip, this would be good
for knocking fruit from the high branches.

23:37.038 --> 23:38.413
I'll bet it would.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.643
- Why do you want to fight them?
- I don't want to.

23:41.599 --> 23:43.675
Then don't.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.635
It's not that simple.

23:50.759 --> 23:54.343
I believe in peace. Just like you. I do.

23:54.278 --> 23:56.567
Then why do you fight?

23:56.559 --> 23:58.848
Because our enemy gives us no option.

23:58.839 --> 24:02.173
Sometimes turning the other cheek
just doesn't work.

24:02.118 --> 24:06.912
- I'll learn to understand them better.
- No! I wouldn't do that if I were you.

24:09.759 --> 24:11.836
Go on, run. Run!

24:30.759 --> 24:31.874
You.

24:31.921 --> 24:35.040
No, thank you. I'm... I'm tryin' to quit.

24:35.759 --> 24:39.094
Is that where you get your medicine?
From the forest?

24:39.038 --> 24:44.460
We get life from the forest.
From everything.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.396
But you must have medicine.

24:48.519 --> 24:51.390
Or you must have some knowledge
that we don't have.

24:51.358 --> 24:54.111
I'm trying to say that
we could learn a lot from you.

24:54.078 --> 24:57.662
I really wish that we could be
friends with the Nox.

24:57.601 --> 25:01.811
Friends share knowledge with each other.

25:03.679 --> 25:06.763
Yes. You have much to learn.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.184
Well, why don't you teach me now?

25:13.038 --> 25:18.080
For example, you seem to have an almost
psychic ability. Are you born with it?

25:17.960 --> 25:20.249
Knowledge takes time.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.607
Over the years
we teach the young to be wise.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.430
- Um...
- How old am I?

25:31.598 --> 25:34.268
How do you mark time?

25:34.240 --> 25:36.316
Years, days. Uh...

25:36.959 --> 25:39.746
A day is one revolution of our planet.

25:39.721 --> 25:42.093
A year is one revolution around our sun.

25:42.078 --> 25:44.404
There are 365 days in one year, so...

25:44.398 --> 25:47.732
Then I am 432 years old.

25:50.719 --> 25:53.045
Well, uh...

25:53.038 --> 25:55.115
you look great.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.755
Thank you.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.836
You will not teach Nafrayu your ways.

26:08.799 --> 26:10.923
How'd you do that?

26:10.920 --> 26:15.582
It is not the Fenri that have
the ability to hide. It is the Nox.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.092
<i>So you hid the Stargate?</i>

26:20.077 --> 26:24.407
A Fenri was nearby when you came
through, attracted by your arrival.

26:24.318 --> 26:27.272
We conceal them
from the hunters who come.

26:27.239 --> 26:29.694
We're not hunters.

26:29.680 --> 26:33.595
- You tried to kill the Fenri a moment ago.
- I was trying to protect the boy.

26:33.519 --> 26:37.220
- After poisoning his mind?
- Will you listen to me?

26:37.161 --> 26:39.318
The Goa'uld hunt those flying things

26:39.319 --> 26:42.689
to find out how it's able to disappear.
If they find out it's you...

26:42.640 --> 26:46.258
Our ways have served us
for as long as our people have lived.

26:46.199 --> 26:50.362
But they didn't know you existed before.
Once they know, they'll enslave you.

26:50.279 --> 26:53.198
- It's what they do.
- We are slaves to no one.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.535
How long have the Goa'uld
been coming here to hunt?

26:58.721 --> 27:00.345
Oh...

27:00.359 --> 27:02.482
As long as I can remember.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.957
Why did you not bury the Stargate?
Do you know that that would stop them?

27:08.838 --> 27:12.208
And they would know
someone had buried it.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.236
Right. Of course.

27:19.079 --> 27:21.653
Ohper is 432 years old.

27:21.638 --> 27:23.714
Guess what? They're not human.

27:24.839 --> 27:29.383
Humanoid, but definitely more advanced
than anything that has evolved on Earth.

27:29.279 --> 27:33.277
That creature we came here for?
It has no power at all. None. Zip.

27:33.798 --> 27:37.250
Well, then, how does it become invisible?

27:37.200 --> 27:41.067
They do it. The Nox hide it from us.

27:40.999 --> 27:44.997
- They make it invisible to protect it?
- This makes things even worse.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.003
If Apophis finds out that it's them
that has this power...

27:47.960 --> 27:50.663
He will try to possess it.
If he finds he cannot,

27:50.640 --> 27:54.258
he will bombard this planet's surface
from high above.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.738
What he cannot possess he destroys.

27:57.038 --> 28:00.989
- So we have to get Shak'l outta here.
- We will not allow you.

28:01.679 --> 28:05.723
- Will you stop doing that?
- You cannot be trusted with your enemy.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.723
Look, if we don't take him
away from here,

28:08.679 --> 28:11.467
he'll tell the Goa'uld -
the bad guys - all about you.

28:11.439 --> 28:14.356
- We are not afraid.
- Well, get afraid.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.395
Colonel...

28:18.039 --> 28:20.791
Look, this is our fault
that this has happened.

28:20.759 --> 28:25.505
- We know that and we want to correct it.
- Shak'l won't be hurt. You have our word.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.645
We will just take him away with us, back
to our planet. Only then will you be safe.

28:29.558 --> 28:31.634
Only if that is his wish.

28:34.519 --> 28:37.686
Jaffa. Pa kree.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.715
I cannot find the Stargate.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.116
Then find me Teal'c.

28:44.519 --> 28:48.895
Jaffa. I offer you
this last chance to join me.

28:49.640 --> 28:54.266
Before you kill me? You're too much of
a coward or you'd have done it already.

28:54.159 --> 28:58.322
- I have no wish to kill you.
- You may wish you had.

29:04.119 --> 29:06.528
What have you done to him?

29:21.240 --> 29:22.520
O'Neill!

29:27.160 --> 29:29.318
Teal'c!

29:29.319 --> 29:31.479
The Nox woman.

29:48.679 --> 29:53.009
- Where'd the Nox go with Lya?
- Who knows where they ever go?

29:53.199 --> 29:56.284
- I trained him well.
- Is he gonna be all right?

29:56.239 --> 29:59.156
- Well, if it were you or me...
- My wound will heal.

29:59.118 --> 30:01.609
- We must find Shak'l.
- We will.

31:15.038 --> 31:17.529
You brought us back the same way?

31:17.519 --> 31:19.478
Yes.

31:20.719 --> 31:22.795
You become visible in the ceremony.

31:22.799 --> 31:27.592
When we are performing the ritual of life,
we are unable to shield ourselves.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.436
A weakness.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.476
We are hidden again.

31:34.599 --> 31:36.675
Shak'l has been this way.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.434
How long ago was he here?

31:42.880 --> 31:44.752
Teal'c?

31:44.759 --> 31:47.628
He is very skilled at evading capture.

31:47.599 --> 31:49.675
Did you teach him that too?

31:57.719 --> 32:01.087
I am curious to see a Goa'uld.
I have never seen one.

32:02.999 --> 32:07.460
No. You should go some place where
it's safe. Go where the other Nox are.

32:07.358 --> 32:10.894
- They're far away.
- Nafrayu, please. Go on, scoot.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.316
Kids!

32:51.398 --> 32:53.723
<i>He's telling him of the Nox.</i>

32:54.839 --> 32:56.915
About their powers.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.316
Apophis will be pleased.

33:02.200 --> 33:06.150
- Nothing has changed for us.
- No, everything has changed.

33:06.079 --> 33:08.155
We will take you to the doorway.

33:08.160 --> 33:12.619
Anteaus, we can come back through
that gate. We'll bring reinforcements.

33:12.519 --> 33:14.845
Anteaus.

33:14.839 --> 33:16.915
Where is Nafrayu?

33:26.279 --> 33:27.478
Nafrayu.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.325
Nafrayu?

33:45.440 --> 33:48.891
- I told him to go home.
- I told you the same.

33:50.359 --> 33:53.942
The very young do not
always do what they are told.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.840
- Feel like a trap to you, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.317
We must begin the ritual.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.692
- No, wait.
- Jack, they can bring him back.

34:40.679 --> 34:44.677
Shak'l told Apophis you cannot remain
hidden when you perform the ritual.

34:44.601 --> 34:45.976
But we must.

34:45.998 --> 34:48.704
The minute you start that ritual,
they'll attack.

34:48.679 --> 34:53.139
- Give us our weapons. We'll defend you.
- There will be no killing.

34:53.398 --> 34:57.018
All right, fine. We'll find
our own way back to the Stargate.

34:56.958 --> 35:01.456
We're certainly not gonna sit around here
and watch a slaughter.

35:01.358 --> 35:03.648
Let's go. It's an order!

35:05.119 --> 35:07.277
Please, we were trying to help.

35:07.278 --> 35:09.235
Goodbye, Daniel.

35:14.639 --> 35:18.588
- D'you think they bought it?
- I almost believed it myself.

35:23.199 --> 35:27.362
- We could take Nafrayu to the others.
- It would take too long.

35:53.079 --> 35:55.036
Where did that come from?

35:55.039 --> 35:57.447
The wee folks missed one.

35:57.438 --> 36:01.483
So Shak'l thinks we're unarmed,
Apophis thinks he's invulnerable.

36:01.400 --> 36:05.693
And they're right.
I think I've found the flaw in your plan.

36:05.599 --> 36:09.431
Their weapons aren't as effective in close.
We'll use hand-to-hand.

36:09.358 --> 36:14.353
Apophis is protected by an energy field.
We both fired our weapons directly at it.

36:14.239 --> 36:18.106
Did you see what happened when one of
his guards tossed him a staff weapon?

36:18.039 --> 36:20.161
Passed right through.

36:21.159 --> 36:24.030
So the shield's deflection capability

36:24.000 --> 36:28.293
is directly proportional to the amount
of kinetic energy being directed at it?

36:28.199 --> 36:28.947
Yeah.

36:28.998 --> 36:33.708
So you're saying an arrow or dart, being
much slower in velocity than a bullet...

36:33.599 --> 36:36.599
Just might make it through.
It's a big gamble, sir.

36:36.559 --> 36:38.018
Yeah.

36:39.079 --> 36:40.110
You ready?

36:56.599 --> 36:58.675
They're coming.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.126
- Fool. I will kill you.
- Again?

38:10.757 --> 38:12.833
No!

38:14.878 --> 38:17.168
They'll be back!

38:18.000 --> 38:20.076
They won't spare you!

38:30.000 --> 38:32.490
This is where the Stargate should be.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.938
We sent your enemy
through the doorway.

38:40.880 --> 38:44.746
- They'll be back.
- When you are gone, we will bury it.

38:44.679 --> 38:48.972
They'll come in ships next time.
They'll bring an army.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.876
Perhaps.

38:58.318 --> 39:00.525
He wanted to wish you farewell.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.811
- I'm glad you're OK.
- And you.

39:05.597 --> 39:08.931
We sent your weapons
back through the doorway.

39:10.400 --> 39:14.978
- Yeah, speaking of the Stargate...
- You fear for us. Yes?

39:15.519 --> 39:16.717
Yes.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.605
Why?

39:18.639 --> 39:22.389
It is our way that
the strong defend the weak.

39:22.878 --> 39:25.369
We're afraid for you.

39:25.358 --> 39:29.737
Before you go, O'Neill, there is
something we would have you see.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.916
My God.

39:48.599 --> 39:50.971
Fear not.

40:02.400 --> 40:07.525
Maybe one day you will learn
that your way is not the only way.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.887
Why didn't he tell us about this before?

40:18.878 --> 40:21.085
I think in their way they did.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.978
It appears they possess a technology
far greater than that of the Goa'uld.

40:32.878 --> 40:34.670
