LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:01.794 --> 00:03.796
<i>Ah, friends, we've had</i>

00:01.794 --> 00:03.796
<i>our highs and lows.</i>

00:03.796 --> 00:06.966
<i>Jane married, but then,</i>

00:03.796 --> 00:06.966
<i>of course, Michael died.</i>

00:06.966 --> 00:08.216
<i>And three years later,</i>

00:08.216 --> 00:10.594
<i>she was still trying</i>

00:08.216 --> 00:10.594
<i>to move on.</i>

00:10.594 --> 00:13.096
<i>And then,</i>

00:10.594 --> 00:13.096
<i>the strangest thing happened.</i>

00:13.096 --> 00:15.182
I love you, so much.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.017
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:15.182 --> 00:17.017
<i>I know. Whoa, right?</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:20.020
<i>But here's the thing:</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:20.020
<i>Rafael wanted to be with Petra,</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:21.939
<i>but Petra was hesitant,</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:21.939
<i>because, well...</i>

00:21.939 --> 00:23.315
We were terrible together.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.734
And now we have

00:23.315 --> 00:25.734
these two happy kids.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.111
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:25.734 --> 00:28.111
<i>Plus, she had this new thing</i>

00:25.734 --> 00:28.111
<i>going with Chuck,</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:30.364
<i>the owner of</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:30.364
<i>the Fairwick Hotel next door.</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:32.449
<i>But eventually,</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:32.449
<i>Raf won her over.</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:34.702
<i>Yeah, he can be</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:34.702
<i>pretty relentless.</i>

00:34.702 --> 00:36.954
<i>Which brings me</i>

00:34.702 --> 00:36.954
<i>to his sister, Luisa.</i>

00:36.954 --> 00:38.873
<i>See, he didn't quite trust her,</i>

00:38.873 --> 00:40.749
<i>or her new girlfriend, Eileen.</i>

00:40.749 --> 00:42.543
If you want to be

00:40.749 --> 00:42.543
in my sister's life,

00:42.543 --> 00:43.961
we need to do

00:42.543 --> 00:43.961
some medical tests.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.629
<i>And it turns out,</i>

00:43.961 --> 00:45.629
<i>Raf was right</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:47.046
<i>to be suspicious, because...</i>

00:47.046 --> 00:48.465
You do realize,

00:47.046 --> 00:48.465
when you pass

00:48.465 --> 00:50.258
this medical exam,

00:48.465 --> 00:50.258
you leave the country.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.260
Or I will have you

00:50.258 --> 00:52.260
killed, make no mistake.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.929
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:52.260 --> 00:53.929
<i>Yup, that's right:</i>

00:53.929 --> 00:57.307
<i>Eileen was really</i>

00:53.929 --> 00:57.307
<i>the crime lord Sin Rostro.</i>

00:57.307 --> 00:58.976
<i>Which brings us to Scott.</i>

00:58.976 --> 01:01.186
<i>I mean, dead Scott.</i>

01:01.186 --> 01:03.772
<i>See, the police recently</i>

01:01.186 --> 01:03.772
<i>identified his killer,</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:04.982
<i>and it was Eileen.</i>

01:04.982 --> 01:06.441
<i>And so, Rafael lied</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:08.109
<i>and told his sister</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:08.109
<i>his cancer was back,</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:09.987
<i>and lured her back</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:09.987
<i>to the Marbella.</i>

01:09.987 --> 01:11.488
<i>And then, this happened...</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:12.698
Don't move.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.199
( gasps )

01:12.698 --> 01:14.199
No!

01:14.199 --> 01:16.535
<i>I know!</i>

01:14.199 --> 01:16.535
<i>What a wild ride, huh?</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:18.037
<i>And speaking of...</i>

01:18.037 --> 01:19.830
<i>after breakups and make-ups</i>

01:19.830 --> 01:21.206
<i>and a horrible reality show</i>

01:21.206 --> 01:23.124
<i>Rogelio filmed</i>

01:21.206 --> 01:23.124
<i>with his ex, Darcy,</i>

01:23.124 --> 01:24.919
<i>Jane's parents finally found</i>

01:24.919 --> 01:26.545
<i>their way back to each other.</i>

01:26.545 --> 01:28.547
<i>And they wanted</i>

01:26.545 --> 01:28.547
<i>a fairy tale wedding.</i>

01:28.547 --> 01:30.758
<i>But, of course,</i>

01:28.547 --> 01:30.758
<i>this isn't a fairy tale,</i>

01:30.758 --> 01:32.217
<i>it's a telenovela.</i>

01:32.217 --> 01:33.928
<i>So let's dive in.</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:38.348
<i>Dearly beloved,</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:38.348
<i>we are gathered here today</i>

01:38.348 --> 01:40.601
<i>to witness a rite of passage.</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:43.311
<i>By now, you know that</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:43.311
<i>the Villanueva women</i>

01:43.311 --> 01:45.564
<i>have been by each other's side,</i>

01:45.564 --> 01:47.691
<i>in sickness and in health,</i>

01:47.691 --> 01:50.402
<i>for richer and poorer...</i>

01:47.691 --> 01:50.402
It's my dream.

01:50.402 --> 01:53.113
( in Spanish )

01:50.402 --> 01:53.113
Dreams don't pay the bills!

01:53.113 --> 01:54.740
<i>...through first loves...</i>

01:54.740 --> 01:56.784
His name is Adam,

01:56.784 --> 01:59.828
and...he's kind of artistic.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.039
<i>...and first heartbreaks...</i>

02:02.039 --> 02:05.584
I promise, you will

02:02.039 --> 02:05.584
fall in love again.

02:05.584 --> 02:09.129
I won't. Not like that.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.673
<i>...through births</i>

02:11.673 --> 02:13.425
<i>and baptisms.</i>

02:13.425 --> 02:15.094
...and of the Son,

02:15.094 --> 02:16.678
and of the Holy Spirit.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.139
<i>And even deaths.</i>

02:22.977 --> 02:26.605
<i>And so, of course, they were</i>

02:22.977 --> 02:26.605
<i>together for this latest event</i>

02:26.605 --> 02:28.816
<i>in the circle of life.</i>

02:33.612 --> 02:35.614
Okay! I'm ordained!

02:35.614 --> 02:37.616
That was so easy.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.535
( in Spanish )

02:37.616 --> 02:40.535
They're not even going to ask

02:37.616 --> 02:40.535
if you believe in God?

02:40.535 --> 02:43.580
No, but their swag game

02:40.535 --> 02:43.580
is on point.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.624
Ooh, for $9 more,

02:45.624 --> 02:47.668
I could get the "Tell It

02:45.624 --> 02:47.668
On The Mountain" package.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.961
It comes with

02:47.668 --> 02:48.961
a parking placard

02:48.961 --> 02:50.671
and a bumper sticker.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.965
( chuckles )

02:50.671 --> 02:52.965
Do you think I need a tote?

02:52.965 --> 02:56.802
Mm, I think you need

02:52.965 --> 02:56.802
seven years in a seminary.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.097
Hm. Shouldn't there be

02:58.219 --> 03:00.097
some kind of template

03:00.097 --> 03:01.723
for what to say

03:00.097 --> 03:01.723
at the wedding?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.726
Actually, your dad and I

03:01.723 --> 03:04.726
were kind of hoping

03:04.726 --> 03:06.603
that you'd come up with

03:04.726 --> 03:06.603
something personal.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.855
We want the ceremony

03:07.855 --> 03:09.397
only you could give us.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.359
Oh! Of course. Of course.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.861
Since you're a writer, right?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.570
Yeah, no, I was just meaning

03:13.861 --> 03:15.570
as, like, a guide.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.365
But, yeah, definitely, this is

03:15.570 --> 03:18.365
a Jane Villanueva joint.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.117
I will just do

03:18.365 --> 03:20.117
a little research,

03:20.117 --> 03:21.869
and I'll write

03:20.117 --> 03:21.869
the whole ceremony.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.911
Yay!

03:22.911 --> 03:24.245
Make sure you really wow us.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.040
( chuckles )

03:24.245 --> 03:26.040
The full waterworks.

03:26.040 --> 03:26.999
Don't hold back.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.167
( high-pitched ):

03:26.999 --> 03:28.167
Great!

03:28.167 --> 03:29.584
Ah...

03:31.545 --> 03:34.213
( in Spanish )

03:31.545 --> 03:34.213
Don't look at me for help.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.884
Ask your colleague.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.807
<i>( uplifting</i>

03:42.305 --> 03:43.807

03:49.938 --> 03:52.524
<i>Please, God. Please, God.</i>

03:52.524 --> 03:54.275
Please. Please.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.653
<i>And here's breaking news</i>

03:54.275 --> 03:56.653
<i>on the weather front.</i>

03:56.653 --> 03:58.864
<i>As of now, it looks like</i>

<i>tropical storm Dolly</i>

ALL:

04:00.074 --> 04:01.116
Yes!

04:01.116 --> 04:03.035
Yes!

04:01.116 --> 04:03.035
Whoo!

04:01.116 --> 04:03.035
Okay.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.579
Time to ditch the rain

04:03.035 --> 04:05.579
contingency Plan B binders,

04:05.579 --> 04:07.664
and go back to

04:05.579 --> 04:07.664
the original checklist.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.041
Did you call

04:07.664 --> 04:09.041
the Palapa Yacht Club

04:09.041 --> 04:10.417
and confirm

04:09.041 --> 04:10.417
our final head count?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.960
Done.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.960
Programs?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.170
Printed.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.170
Paparazzi?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.295
"Accidentally" tipped off.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.296
Enemies list?

04:15.296 --> 04:17.007
All your ex-wives and ex-agents

04:17.007 --> 04:18.550
send their regrets.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.886
Marc Anthony<i> is</i> attending,

04:18.550 --> 04:20.886
and per your instructions,

04:20.886 --> 04:23.638
he will be be asked

04:20.886 --> 04:23.638
"Who are you?" and turned away.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.933
Excellent!

04:23.638 --> 04:25.933
You're on fire!

04:25.933 --> 04:27.601
I know, right?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.810
No, you're actually on fire!

04:28.810 --> 04:30.562
Oh. Not again.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.314
I have everything under control!

04:33.314 --> 04:34.816
Heh. Don't worry.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.317
I'm totally panicking.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.945
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

04:36.317 --> 04:37.945
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

04:37.945 --> 04:39.905
I keep trying

04:37.945 --> 04:39.905
to write the ceremony,

04:39.905 --> 04:42.657
and...I just feel stuck.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.368
So, I was thinking

04:42.657 --> 04:45.368
that maybe

04:45.368 --> 04:47.829
you could help me with

04:45.368 --> 04:47.829
the structure, as a colleague.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.875
But way more important

04:48.997 --> 04:51.875
and legit. Heh.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.045
I suspect your parents just want

04:51.875 --> 04:55.045
you to speak from the heart.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.296
Right.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.423
But maybe also

04:58.423 --> 05:00.050
around a central

04:58.423 --> 05:00.050
unifying theme,

05:00.050 --> 05:01.593
which you can suggest.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.846
You know what?

05:02.719 --> 05:04.846
Here's an assignment:

05:04.846 --> 05:06.681
Think about your parents,

05:06.681 --> 05:08.976
why they're marrying,

05:06.681 --> 05:08.976
why they're meant to be.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.894
Write it down,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.894
don't censor yourself,

05:10.894 --> 05:12.479
for ten minutes.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.940
I'm thinking

05:12.479 --> 05:14.940
a theme will emerge.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.860
You're always giving me

05:16.483 --> 05:18.860
writing assignments.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.656
Wait, a writing

05:21.280 --> 05:22.656
assignment?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.032
FATHER GUSTAVO:

05:22.656 --> 05:24.032
A small one.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.201
I always recommend

05:24.032 --> 05:26.201
couples write a letter

05:26.201 --> 05:28.078
to each other

05:26.201 --> 05:28.078
before the wedding.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.122
To read later

05:28.078 --> 05:30.122
when times get tougher

05:30.122 --> 05:32.415
and you need to remember how you

05:30.122 --> 05:32.415
feel about each other right now.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.709
I love that idea.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.837
It's so romantic.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.755
Well, that's 'cause you're

05:36.837 --> 05:38.755
a writer--it's easy for you.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.175
What about, like,

05:38.755 --> 05:41.175
a basketball game once a month

05:41.175 --> 05:42.383
to re-up our bond?

05:42.383 --> 05:43.969
Michael.

05:46.138 --> 05:50.225
Okay, fine. I'll write you

05:46.138 --> 05:50.225
a super-gushy love letter.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.726
It better make me cry.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.895
You're an easy cry.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.895
( grunts )

05:53.895 --> 05:55.480
Sorry, I meant,

05:55.480 --> 05:59.234
it'll be

05:55.480 --> 05:59.234
an easy letter to write.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.321
Seriously, I'll just

05:59.234 --> 06:02.321
write about how lucky I feel

06:02.321 --> 06:04.698
to be marrying you,

06:02.321 --> 06:04.698
because I do.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.365
Every single day.

06:07.366 --> 06:08.702
( sobs softly )

06:08.702 --> 06:11.370
See? Bam!

06:11.370 --> 06:12.789
( laughs )

06:12.789 --> 06:14.875
Can that count as my

06:12.789 --> 06:14.875
letter? What I said?

Michael's letter.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.806
I remember he wrote

06:27.595 --> 06:29.806
very eloquently about it.

Heh. He certainly did.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.437
He showed it to me.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.430
And Papa and Abuela

18:56.886 --> 18:59.430
are sad about it, too.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.015
I have an idea.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.558
Oh.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.019
Maybe I can give them

19:02.558 --> 19:05.019
some of the gummy worms

19:05.019 --> 19:06.353
from my secret

19:05.019 --> 19:06.353
hiding spot

19:06.353 --> 19:07.730
to make them feel better.

19:09.607 --> 19:12.693
( in Spanish )

19:09.607 --> 19:12.693
A secret hiding spot?

19:12.693 --> 19:15.154
Is that why I found ants

19:12.693 --> 19:15.154
in your room last week?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.782
( floor creaks )

19:16.238 --> 19:17.782
Whoa.

19:19.742 --> 19:20.994
Whoa, look at this.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.787
We'll just have

19:20.994 --> 19:22.787
the landlord fix it.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.123
Are you kidding?

19:22.787 --> 19:25.123
It's the best hiding spot ever.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.666
It makes me want

19:25.123 --> 19:26.666
this place even more.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.459
Yeah? What are you

19:26.666 --> 19:28.459
gonna hide in it?

19:28.459 --> 19:29.919
Your spy decoder ring?

19:29.919 --> 19:32.046
How do you know about

19:29.919 --> 19:32.046

19:35.299 --> 19:36.884
Can you take Mateo to Rafael

19:35.299 --> 19:36.884
before you go to work?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.636
I got to check something.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.636
ALBA:<i> Sí.</i>

19:38.636 --> 19:40.013
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

19:42.389 --> 19:44.809
Hi! I am so sorry

19:44.809 --> 19:45.935
to bother you.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.394
It's a funny story.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.396
I actually used to live here

19:47.394 --> 19:49.396
with my husband,

19:49.396 --> 19:51.107
uh, but then he died.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.566
Not-not the funny part.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.652
Uh, I-I'm-- I'm looking

19:52.566 --> 19:54.652
for a love letter

19:54.652 --> 19:57.237
that he wrote me

19:54.652 --> 19:57.237
before he was shot.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.948
Also not the funny part.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.784
Anyway, um, there's a broken

19:58.948 --> 20:01.784
floorboard in the living room

20:01.784 --> 20:03.577
that we used

20:01.784 --> 20:03.577
to joke around about,

20:03.577 --> 20:05.038
and...

20:05.038 --> 20:06.372
I think that the letter

20:06.372 --> 20:07.915
still might be hidden there.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.709
So can I come in

20:07.915 --> 20:09.709
and check real quick?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.169
ROGELIO:

20:09.709 --> 20:11.169
<i>Thank you for doing this.</i>

20:11.169 --> 20:13.171
We thought it would be

20:11.169 --> 20:13.171
a good idea

20:13.171 --> 20:15.048
if we all sat down

20:13.171 --> 20:15.048
and talked.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.925
To put your mind at ease,

20:15.048 --> 20:17.925
I don't want any money.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.802
I will support her myself.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.680
( gasps )

20:19.802 --> 20:22.680
We're having a girl?

20:22.680 --> 20:23.764
Yes.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.016
Rogeliana.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.767
We didn't agree

20:25.016 --> 20:26.767
on Rogeliana.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.227
You said

20:26.767 --> 20:28.227
you were open to it.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.812
That was just to get you

20:28.227 --> 20:29.812
to sign the contract.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.647
And I agreed to sign...

20:29.812 --> 20:31.647
I'm not naming my daughter

20:31.647 --> 20:33.482
after the planet's

20:31.647 --> 20:33.482
biggest narcissist...

20:33.482 --> 20:36.069
...thinking it's Rogeliana!

20:33.482 --> 20:36.069
...you're clinically insane!

20:36.069 --> 20:38.779
Can we just table

20:36.069 --> 20:38.779
the names for the moment?

20:38.779 --> 20:40.239
Agreed.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.615
( thunder rumbling )

20:41.615 --> 20:43.034
I want to confirm

20:43.034 --> 20:44.493
that we'll share custody,

20:44.493 --> 20:45.912
per our previous agreement.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.039
No. I want primary custody.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.041
What--?

20:48.039 --> 20:50.041
The previous agreement was made

20:50.041 --> 20:51.542
when we were gonna

20:50.041 --> 20:51.542
do this together

20:51.542 --> 20:53.044
and we actually liked

20:51.542 --> 20:53.044
each other.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.837
Everything is different

20:53.044 --> 20:54.837
now that I hate you.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.090
Well, I hate you, too, but

20:54.837 --> 20:57.090
you're the mother of my child.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.008
So I will keep

20:57.090 --> 20:59.008
that very real, intense,

20:59.008 --> 21:00.927
and almost violent hatred

20:59.008 --> 21:00.927
inside,

21:00.927 --> 21:04.931
because I want to be involved

21:00.927 --> 21:04.931
in my child's life.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.515
You can have

21:04.931 --> 21:06.515
two weekends a month,

21:06.515 --> 21:08.768
one major holiday,

21:06.515 --> 21:08.768
and two weeks in the summer.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.561
No. I want more.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.730
And you should want him

21:10.561 --> 21:12.730
to have more.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.815
He's a great father--

21:12.730 --> 21:14.815
you know that.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.817
No one has a bigger heart,

21:16.817 --> 21:19.946
and no one

21:16.817 --> 21:19.946
is more loyal or devoted.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.367

Heh. Dad says Mateo's

25:09.300 --> 25:11.844
being a good wingman.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.529

That's your book.

Oh, I used to sit on

this bus and write.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.745
Dreaming of this.

No, that doesn't feel

25:48.088 --> 25:50.799
like meant to be,

25:50.799 --> 25:53.010
because that would

25:50.799 --> 25:53.010
make it sound too easy.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.054
And it was an incredible amount

25:53.010 --> 25:55.054
of hard work

25:58.015 --> 26:01.101

Be careful

26:24.041 --> 26:25.667
with the dress!

This thing is

26:25.667 --> 26:27.420
so well packed,

26:27.420 --> 26:29.671
we could take it to the top of

26:27.420 --> 26:29.671
Everest and we'd be fine.

Welcome to the Marbella.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.146
Sorry the Fairwick failed you.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.524
Next time, maybe choose a hotel

26:46.146 --> 26:48.524
that has a safety plan.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.234
Wait. We can't do this.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.152
We have to keep this room clear

26:50.234 --> 26:52.152
for the Villanueva wedding.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.571
We're in the middle

26:52.152 --> 26:53.571
of a hurricane.

26:53.571 --> 26:56.449
Rafael was very clear.

26:53.571 --> 26:56.449
He promised Jane.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.658
Of course he did.

26:58.658 --> 27:02.079

26:58.658 --> 27:02.079

Of course my dress in ruined.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.639
Look around.

27:21.639 --> 27:24.435
We're getting married

27:21.639 --> 27:24.435
in the middle of a hurricane.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.686
Oh, who cares?

27:26.686 --> 27:28.564
I just want

27:26.686 --> 27:28.564
to marry your father.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.774
Okay. Well, then we'll make do.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.568
Hey, we got the hookup

27:30.774 --> 27:32.568
at the gift shop.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.611
Oh, and you know what,

27:33.611 --> 27:34.945
I won't even wear my dress,

27:34.945 --> 27:36.405
so that I don't distract

27:34.945 --> 27:36.405
from the bride.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.031
No, it's fine.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.075
You're the officiant,

27:38.031 --> 27:40.075

Heh, okay.

ALBA ( in Spanish ):

27:41.535 --> 27:42.995
Wait, Xiomara.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.081
I want so say

27:42.995 --> 27:46.081
something to you

27:46.081 --> 27:48.626
before

27:46.081 --> 27:48.626
everything happens.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.963
Actually, I'm going

27:49.835 --> 27:52.963
to yell at you!

27:52.963 --> 27:54.381
What?

27:54.381 --> 27:55.799
So you don't cry!

27:55.799 --> 27:57.717
Because your makeup

27:55.799 --> 27:57.717
looks good!

27:57.717 --> 27:59.761
( both laugh )

28:01.430 --> 28:03.599
I love you so much!

28:05.809 --> 28:08.479
And if your father

28:05.809 --> 28:08.479
were alive,

28:08.479 --> 28:12.024
I know he'd be so proud

Dearly beloved,

29:20.800 --> 29:22.969
we are gathered

29:20.800 --> 29:22.969
here today to witness

29:22.969 --> 29:24.804
the marriage of two people...

29:24.804 --> 29:26.765
who are not meant to be.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.642
( thunder rumbling )

29:28.642 --> 29:31.103
It's true.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.480
They met when

29:31.103 --> 29:33.480
they were teenagers,

29:33.480 --> 29:36.275
and they were both

29:33.480 --> 29:36.275
a mess, honestly.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.237
And then they didn't see

29:36.275 --> 29:40.237
each other again for 23 years.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.905
And the reunion?

29:41.905 --> 29:43.782
That was a mess, too.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.660
Breakups and makeups

29:43.782 --> 29:46.660
and misunderstandings

29:46.660 --> 29:49.037
and hurt feelings

See?

rooting against them.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.629
( audience chuckles )

29:56.629 --> 29:59.881
My parents are here today, not

29:56.629 --> 29:59.881
because they are meant to be,

29:59.881 --> 30:02.468
but because

29:59.881 --> 30:02.468
they chose each other.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.928
In the face of

30:02.468 --> 30:04.928
a million obstacles,

30:04.928 --> 30:06.722
they chose each other.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.349
When it seemed like

30:06.722 --> 30:09.349
they should give up,

30:09.349 --> 30:11.518
they chose each other.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.104
And they keep

30:11.518 --> 30:14.104
choosing each other,

30:14.104 --> 30:19.067
in the face of every single

30:14.104 --> 30:19.067
twist and turn life brings them,

30:19.067 --> 30:20.778
every single day.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.616
And that is not destiny.

30:25.616 --> 30:27.576
That is not fate.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.536
That's commitment.

For richer, for poorer,

30:29.536 --> 30:33.081
in sickness and in health,

30:33.081 --> 30:37.670

30:37.670 --> 30:41.006
they have earned

30:37.670 --> 30:41.006
their happy ending.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.970
And by the power vested in me,

30:46.970 --> 30:49.055
by the Circle of Life

30:46.970 --> 30:49.055
Sacred Church,

30:49.055 --> 30:53.727
I now pronounce you

30:49.055 --> 30:53.727

What are you doing here?

31:10.744 --> 31:12.705
My hotel was evacuated,

remember?

31:12.705 --> 31:15.123
( thunder rumbling )

31:15.123 --> 31:17.042
And I was looking for you...

31:18.335 --> 31:22.922
because that ceremony,

31:18.335 --> 31:22.922
it reminded me...of us.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.928
Look, we break up,

31:25.050 --> 31:28.928
we make up,

31:28.928 --> 31:31.890
but we always

31:28.928 --> 31:31.890
come back together.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.185
I was watching you

31:31.890 --> 31:35.185
all night long.

31:36.770 --> 31:38.438
Watching him.

31:40.774 --> 31:44.069
And all I kept thinking was,

31:44.069 --> 31:47.239
"Is she gonna turn around

31:44.069 --> 31:47.239
and look at me?"

32:04.464 --> 32:05.841
It didn't mean anything.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.384
We've been back together

32:05.841 --> 32:07.384
for a week.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.803
I know!

32:07.384 --> 32:09.803
I was just feeling

32:09.803 --> 32:11.889
very insecure, and-and he was

32:09.803 --> 32:11.889
saying all the right things,

32:11.889 --> 32:13.056
and it just happened.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.391
Insecure about what?

32:14.391 --> 32:15.851
You and Jane.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.102
Yeah, I know.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.978
You'll say

32:17.102 --> 32:18.978
you're just best friends,

32:18.978 --> 32:20.898
but that's not it.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.441
She looks at you

32:22.441 --> 32:25.277
like...

32:22.441 --> 32:25.277
like that's not it.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.486
Okay, you are way off.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.071
No, I'm not.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.573
And you chose her before.

32:29.573 --> 32:32.618
A long time ago.
