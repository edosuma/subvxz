WEBVTT

00:03.367 --> 00:06.534
This league is their nba,
and they know it's not yours.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.667
If continuing this
pregnancy means i lose you,

00:09.734 --> 00:11.067
then we end it.

00:11.134 --> 00:12.734
I'm having this baby.

00:12.801 --> 00:15.734
<i>We're having this baby.</i>

00:15.801 --> 00:16.534
I'm here because
i can't live without you,

00:16.600 --> 00:17.734
millicent huxtable.

00:19.901 --> 00:21.667
I think
we should end this.

00:21.734 --> 00:24.101
You deserve
more than this.

00:24.168 --> 00:25.534
I'm calling
the lawyers tomorrow,

00:25.600 --> 00:27.201
and i'm divesting my interest
in clothes over bros.

00:27.268 --> 00:29.400
Now you have a company
and no daughter.

00:29.467 --> 00:30.567
Sam.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.400
Maybe it's time we write
our own epic love story.

00:37.467 --> 00:38.767
This time tomorrow,

00:38.834 --> 00:40.400
we could be walking
on a beach in malibu.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.201
But what about sam?

00:42.268 --> 00:44.300
He loves you.
He's a great guy.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.801
He wants us all
to try it out together.

00:46.867 --> 00:49.001
<i>God, you have to go.
You have to.</i>

00:49.067 --> 00:51.867
You're not coming.
I have a life here, and...

00:51.934 --> 00:53.634
goodbye, brooke davis.

01:08.867 --> 01:10.734
Sam, cut it out!

01:10.801 --> 01:12.534
Well, well.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.767
Oh, my eyes!

01:16.834 --> 01:18.234
It's called sunlight.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.234
<i>And it's not
that bright.</i>

01:20.300 --> 01:22.101
It is not the sun.

01:22.168 --> 01:24.534
It's your face.
Wha...

01:24.600 --> 01:26.333
what the hell
are you doing here?

01:26.400 --> 01:28.001
Last time we talked

01:28.067 --> 01:31.101
was the last time
i wanted us to talk ever!

01:31.168 --> 01:33.001
We need to discuss
the business.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.567
I'm not part
of the business anymore,

01:34.634 --> 01:36.034
which is exactly
what you wanted.

01:36.101 --> 01:37.667
You got a company.
You lost a daughter.

01:37.734 --> 01:40.067
Now get out!

01:40.134 --> 01:42.134
Whatever.

01:42.201 --> 01:45.400
You pull yourself together.
I'll be back.

01:45.467 --> 01:47.667
Why?!

01:49.901 --> 01:51.300
Oh, no, sam.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.134
Hey.

01:56.201 --> 01:57.801
Are you okay?

01:57.867 --> 01:59.867
She frightens me.

01:59.934 --> 02:01.801
Yeah.

02:01.867 --> 02:03.967
Me too.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.034
Let's go. Let's go, baby.
Let's go.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.600
Look out. Look out. Look out.
Come on, block that.

02:16.001 --> 02:16.967
Good job, guys.

02:17.034 --> 02:18.767
Nice work, nate.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.234
Nino,
take the point.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.034
Run it again.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.201
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby.

02:27.067 --> 02:29.500
Oh, oh, here it comes.
Here it comes.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.268
Ball, ball, ball.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.834
Oh, yeah.

02:35.734 --> 02:38.567
Great.
Great job, guys.

02:38.634 --> 02:40.801
Good practice.
Hit the showers.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.168
Nathan.

02:50.234 --> 02:51.634
It seems
i've got a problem.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.300
My two best players
are playing the same position.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.534
If we're gonna have a chance
at winning,

02:56.600 --> 02:58.834
i need you and nino
on the court together.

02:58.901 --> 03:01.567
So, i'm moving back
to shooting guard.

03:01.634 --> 03:03.567
No, no, i'm moving nino
to shooting guard,

03:03.634 --> 03:05.201
and i'm keeping you
at the point.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.700
But i need for you to help him
with the transition.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.700
Yeah, okay.

03:10.767 --> 03:11.801
Okay.

03:11.867 --> 03:14.101
And, nathan...

03:14.168 --> 03:17.101
it's time for you to step up
and be a leader.

03:17.168 --> 03:18.667
This is your team now.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.867
Hi, miss lauren.

03:32.934 --> 03:34.333
Oh, hey, jamie.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.700
Haley, hey.

03:35.767 --> 03:37.367
I have some good news
for you.

03:39.367 --> 03:42.067
Jamie scored through the roof
on his standardized tests.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.734
Really?
Oh, that's great.
I know, it is.

03:44.801 --> 03:47.234
Have you heard
of the oppenheimer
school for the gifted?

03:47.300 --> 03:49.567
Yeah, i used to dream
of going there.

03:49.634 --> 03:51.333
Well, they tend
to monitor these things,

03:51.400 --> 03:53.534
and they're really interested
in meeting with jamie.

04:01.433 --> 04:02.867
Boop!

04:02.934 --> 04:05.634
It's been a long time
since we done this, dawg.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.433
You got to be
kidding me.

04:11.134 --> 04:13.067
Bam!

04:13.134 --> 04:16.300
Look, i'm sorry
about the movie, bro.

04:16.367 --> 04:17.466
Eh, thanks.

04:17.534 --> 04:19.201
I mean, i was reluctant
about it at first.

04:19.267 --> 04:22.067
But now that it's gone,
i miss it.

04:22.134 --> 04:24.101
Ain't that the way
it always is?

04:24.168 --> 04:26.034
Yeah.

04:26.101 --> 04:27.634
So, what's been going on
with you, huh?

04:27.700 --> 04:30.567
I mean, besides being
insanely lucky at horse.

04:30.634 --> 04:32.767
Well, you know, coaching
jamie's basketball team,

04:32.834 --> 04:35.101
i split up with deb,
and i took mouth on a road trip.

04:35.168 --> 04:37.400
Whoa, whoa. Say that again.
What was that middle part?

04:37.467 --> 04:38.634
<i>You broke up with deb?</i>

04:38.700 --> 04:40.767
<i>Okay, actually,
she broke up with me.</i>

04:40.834 --> 04:42.067
But...

04:42.134 --> 04:44.001
i don't know.
I'm just trying to get past it.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.934
Yeah,
i'm sorry about that.

04:47.001 --> 04:50.201
But, hey, at least mouth will
have someone to hang out with.

04:50.268 --> 04:51.600
And misery loves company.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.700
Actually,
mouth's doing just fine.

04:58.700 --> 04:59.967
Morning.

05:00.034 --> 05:04.367
Wow, you look so much better
in that shirt that i do.

05:04.433 --> 05:07.367
Yeah, but you looked
so much better in my camisol c

05:07.433 --> 05:08.600
hey, you said
you wouldn't tell.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.767
Where's your head?

05:12.834 --> 05:15.534
Happy.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.268
Sorry. I don't know
why we ever waited.

05:18.367 --> 05:21.433
Hey, as long as we ended up
here, it was worth the wait.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.834
I have a surprise
for you.

05:22.901 --> 05:25.934
You are just full of surprises,
marvin mcfadden.

05:26.001 --> 05:27.901
Broadway tickets
to "in the heights."

05:27.967 --> 05:29.168
Are you serious?

05:29.234 --> 05:30.400
You're amazing.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.534
<i>No, you are.</i>

05:31.600 --> 05:33.600
And i promised myself,
if i ever got you back,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.967
i'd do everything i could
to make you happy.

05:36.034 --> 05:37.433
Well, you didn't
have to do that.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.168
Just being here with you
makes me happy.

05:39.234 --> 05:41.067
Okay, good, 'cause i can
probably scalp these tickets

05:41.134 --> 05:42.300
for twice
what i paid for them.

05:42.367 --> 05:43.667
<i>I'm not that happy.</i>

06:05.001 --> 06:06.400
Hey, where are you?

06:06.467 --> 06:09.168
Oh, you are
gonna be jealous!

06:09.234 --> 06:11.034
Try me.

06:13.834 --> 06:17.101
Top down, listening
to a great mia catalano song,

06:17.168 --> 06:18.734
very happy to be alive.

06:18.801 --> 06:20.534
<i>I am jealous.</i>

06:20.600 --> 06:21.700
That's a great song.

06:21.767 --> 06:22.801
It is.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.467
And i'll be in
as soon as it ends, okay?

06:24.534 --> 06:26.134
Bye.
Bye.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.134
Luke?

06:58.201 --> 07:00.067
She's okay.
She's gonna be all right.

07:00.134 --> 07:01.434
They're running some tests.

07:01.501 --> 07:03.967
And the baby?

07:05.267 --> 07:07.767
Lucas, what's the face?
What is it? Tell me.

07:09.501 --> 07:13.167
There were some complications
with the pregnancy ...

07:13.234 --> 07:14.700
before the accident.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.000
What are you talking about?
What complications?

07:17.067 --> 07:20.334
Peyton has a condition
called placenta previa.

07:20.401 --> 07:22.134
What is that?
What does that mean?

07:22.201 --> 07:24.600
Well, it means that she runs
the risk of hemorrhaging

07:24.667 --> 07:27.867
during pregnancy
or during delivery.

07:27.934 --> 07:29.633
Okay.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.367
But she's gonna be okay ...
her and the baby.

07:32.434 --> 07:36.301
Yeah, yeah. If everything
goes perfectly, yes.

07:36.367 --> 07:39.401
Lucas, come on, what if
everything doesn't go perfectly?

07:41.733 --> 07:44.967
Well, then we could
lose her, brooke.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.367
She could die, and...

07:49.434 --> 07:51.067
and the baby, too.

08:02.401 --> 08:04.967
Coach talk to you
about moving to shooting guard?

08:05.034 --> 08:07.534
Maybe.
What's it to you?

08:09.134 --> 08:11.267
He wants me
to help you out.

08:11.334 --> 08:13.568
<i>He wants you
to help me out?</i>

08:13.633 --> 08:15.234
That's what he said.

08:15.301 --> 08:16.834
Well, considering how
i'm better than you,

08:16.900 --> 08:18.201
there's nothing
you could teach me

08:18.267 --> 08:19.700
that i don't already know.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.568
You think
you're better than me.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.000
<i>I know i am.</i>

08:25.067 --> 08:26.568
Okay.

08:27.934 --> 08:29.101
Prove it.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.933
Just like magic!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.700
It's all day, scott.

08:35.767 --> 08:38.467
All day.
Make it, take it.

08:46.334 --> 08:47.934
Can't stop this, baby.
Come on.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.667
Yeah, but you're
a two guard now,

08:51.733 --> 08:53.401
so let's see
the jump shot.

08:53.468 --> 08:54.767
I won't even guard you.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.034
All right.

08:56.101 --> 08:57.101
It's all you.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.067
That's what i thought.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.134
Game point.

09:24.201 --> 09:25.900
Next basket wins.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.900
What are you gonna
teach me now, scott?

09:29.201 --> 09:31.234
Well, if i'm the point guard,
i'll drive.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.234
If i'm the shooting guard...

09:36.468 --> 09:37.600
...i shoot.

09:37.667 --> 09:38.600
Game.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.633
Lesson's over.

09:40.700 --> 09:45.101
Now, you can either learn how
to play shooting guard and start

09:45.167 --> 09:47.867
or you can be
a backup point guard.

09:47.934 --> 09:49.934
It's your choice.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.267
I'm telling you,

10:03.334 --> 10:06.934
that woman was like a zombie,
a vampire, and principal rimkus

10:07.000 --> 10:08.334
all rolled into one.

10:08.401 --> 10:09.867
And she's brooke's mom?

10:09.934 --> 10:11.434
Yeah.
Totally scary.

10:11.501 --> 10:13.834
Okay.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.934
Name one thing that scares
the hell out of you ...

10:16.000 --> 10:17.700
other than brooke's mom.

10:19.501 --> 10:20.967
Being alone.

10:23.267 --> 10:25.501
And you kissing me again.
That was gross.

10:25.568 --> 10:26.800
Totally.

10:26.867 --> 10:29.834
You want to know
what scares me?

10:29.900 --> 10:32.301
You know
that burger king guy?
Mm-hmm.

10:32.367 --> 10:33.800
Like the king?
Mm-hmm.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.633
He scares the hell
out of me.

10:38.267 --> 10:42.700
So, i've been talking
to some possible foster parents.

10:46.267 --> 10:48.434
What are they like?

10:48.501 --> 10:50.733
They actually seem
pretty cool.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.401
But...

10:52.468 --> 10:54.034
they live in charlotte.

10:56.934 --> 10:59.867
You should go.

10:59.934 --> 11:01.334
You're going, right?

11:01.401 --> 11:03.934
I don't know.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.900
Why wouldn't you go?

11:06.967 --> 11:10.667
Being alone scares the hell
out of you.

11:11.967 --> 11:13.234
Hello!

11:13.301 --> 11:15.401
Oh, crap, it's her.
Hide.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.234
You might as well stand up.

11:25.301 --> 11:27.700
I can see
your unfortunate split ends.

11:37.301 --> 11:40.367
What is this now?
A-a homeless shelter?

11:40.434 --> 11:43.201
Um, i'm brooke's
foster kid, sam,

11:43.267 --> 11:44.767
and this is jack.

11:46.468 --> 11:48.034
So, you're here
to sponge off my daughter

11:48.101 --> 11:50.434
just like the rest
of her so-called friends.

11:53.867 --> 11:55.201
Well?!

11:55.267 --> 11:56.468
Speak!

11:56.534 --> 11:58.501
We don't like you.

12:03.267 --> 12:05.134
Where's brooke?
I need to speak with her.

12:05.201 --> 12:08.967
She's, um ...  she's actually
outside on the patio

12:09.034 --> 12:11.067
working on some sketches.

12:18.101 --> 12:19.633
Well played.

12:23.434 --> 12:25.568
Too bad i have a key.

12:38.867 --> 12:41.134
Hi.

12:41.201 --> 12:42.600
Hey.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.967
Hey, brooke davis,
you are not crying.

12:45.034 --> 12:47.334
I'm okay.
It's okay.

12:47.401 --> 12:48.767
I'm okay.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.600
That's not what lucas said.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.167
He told you?

12:55.301 --> 12:56.667
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

12:57.767 --> 12:59.201
I was going to,

12:59.267 --> 13:01.967
but i wanted you
to go to l.a. With julian.

13:02.034 --> 13:04.468
And i knew that you wouldn't go
if you knew.

13:06.301 --> 13:08.468
You suck
for not telling me.

13:08.534 --> 13:11.034
And i'm not going
anywhere, so...

13:15.934 --> 13:18.267
what are we gonna do,
p. Sawyer?

13:18.334 --> 13:21.067
How am i gonna help us
get through this?

13:22.534 --> 13:24.134
I don't know.

13:24.201 --> 13:26.201
We just will.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.700
You're damn right
we will.

13:43.101 --> 13:44.434
Home sweet home.

13:44.501 --> 13:46.167
Let's get you to bed.

13:46.234 --> 13:48.667
Luke, you can
stop worrying.

13:48.733 --> 13:50.334
I'm gonna worry,

13:50.401 --> 13:52.733
and i'm gonna keep worrying
for the next few months.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.700
Honey, i'm fine.
The baby's fine.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.934
It's mid-afternoon.
I don't need a nap.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.067
Wait.

14:01.568 --> 14:02.900
What's that?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.633
Yeah, the baby says it's
definitely time to take a nap.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.301
Good call, baby.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.834
I agree.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.568
Let's go.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.367
All right, safe and sound.
Here we go.

14:13.434 --> 14:17.700
Speaking of safe and sound,
how's the comet?

14:17.767 --> 14:21.234
Don't worry
about the car, okay?

14:26.434 --> 14:28.267
I'm sure it'll be okay.

14:35.301 --> 14:36.900
Damn, that car's dead.

14:36.967 --> 14:40.434
How in the world
diwalk away from this?

14:40.501 --> 14:41.733
It's

14:41.800 --> 14:43.767
yeah, well, it's gonna
take a second miracle

14:43.834 --> 14:45.633
to put this thing
back together.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.967
Cost more to fix it
than what it's worth.

14:49.934 --> 14:52.234
It's worth more
than you know.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.501
Oppenheimer has the best
curriculum in north carolina.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.934
We even have pre-kindergarten
computer courses.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.834
And all of our students
matriculate

15:05.900 --> 15:07.134
to top-tier universities.

15:07.201 --> 15:09.600
So, this is where all the kids
i beat up came from.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.568
Why don't we have jamie
take a seat

15:11.633 --> 15:13.967
while i show you two
the rest of the campus?

15:14.034 --> 15:15.134
Okay.

15:15.201 --> 15:17.234
Just t  have fun,
okay, buddy?

15:17.301 --> 15:18.934
Bye, buddy.

15:40.201 --> 15:42.201
What could possibly
be so important

15:42.267 --> 15:44.534
that you'd bother someone
who hates you?

15:46.700 --> 15:49.800
I'm here
because of the business.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.401
It's in trouble.

15:53.334 --> 15:55.067
So, it's tanking.

15:55.134 --> 15:57.067
Looks like
you're not the one

15:57.134 --> 15:59.934
who spins the straw into gold
after all.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.101
It's just a little difficult
to find decent straw these days.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.134
I need you back.

16:06.201 --> 16:07.234
You should have thought
of that

16:07.301 --> 16:08.600
before you hired
the second runner-up

16:08.667 --> 16:10.167
from "project runway."

16:10.234 --> 16:11.767
I had to hire somebody.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.800
I wasn't exactly expecting
my daughter to quit on me.

16:14.867 --> 16:17.067
To quit on you?

16:17.134 --> 16:21.167
You told me you wished
i'd never been born.

16:21.234 --> 16:23.700
Right after you showed up
at my apartment with a gun

16:23.767 --> 16:25.733
and accused me
of having you attacked.

16:28.067 --> 16:31.301
Look,
we both said things.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.334
We both were wrong.

16:36.134 --> 16:39.367
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'm not gonna help you.

16:39.434 --> 16:41.568
You're on your own.
Sorry.

16:43.034 --> 16:44.301
Fine.

16:46.201 --> 16:50.000
You know, it's one thing
to refuse to help me.

16:50.067 --> 16:51.667
But what about
all those other people

16:51.733 --> 16:52.867
that used to work for you?

16:54.401 --> 16:57.401
Those people
who made you who you are...

16:57.468 --> 16:59.501
they'll all be
out of work.

17:01.401 --> 17:03.501
But you could
change that.

17:06.934 --> 17:08.568
It's a shame.

17:26.034 --> 17:28.700
Jamie, why don't you introduce
yourself to the class?

17:28.767 --> 17:33.500
Go ahead.
It's okay.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.767
How's everyone doing?

17:39.500 --> 17:43.001
Last week, my mom asked me
how i like going to school.

17:43.067 --> 17:46.700
I told her, "not as much
as i like coming home from it."

17:49.634 --> 17:51.867
Why wouldn't you want
to go to school?

17:55.834 --> 17:57.800
Here, why don't you
put this on?

17:57.867 --> 18:00.634
That way you'll feel
more comfortable.

18:02.034 --> 18:04.533
Okay, students, it
is time for recess.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.700
Everyone get
your recess books out.

18:16.368 --> 18:19.001
It's been so beautiful
here this week.

18:19.067 --> 18:21.334
I didn't realize
how much i missed the city.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.834
Yeah, it's nice.

18:23.901 --> 18:26.067
Remember when
i was telling you

18:26.134 --> 18:29.167
that maybe there is
this better version of us?

18:29.234 --> 18:31.567
I think this is it.

18:31.634 --> 18:33.201
Me too.

18:33.268 --> 18:35.001
Well, almost.

18:35.067 --> 18:36.134
Why almost?

18:36.201 --> 18:38.634
You have to go back
to tree hill tomorrow.

18:39.867 --> 18:41.167
I wish i could stay,

18:41.234 --> 18:43.400
but i'm already
the world's flakiest employee.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.334
I know.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.667
Let's just enjoy today...

18:47.734 --> 18:49.867
this...now.

19:05.600 --> 19:06.800
So, what is this?

19:06.867 --> 19:09.368
Here at oppenheimer,
we don't offer sports.

19:09.433 --> 19:13.134
But we do try to incorporate
them into learning exercises.

19:13.201 --> 19:15.301
This is called
"math-ketball."

19:15.368 --> 19:16.800
Math-ketball.

19:16.867 --> 19:19.834
We have some of the best
"math-letes" in the state.

19:19.901 --> 19:22.167
That's a three-point
"math-ket."

19:22.234 --> 19:27.433
In...your...face!

19:29.600 --> 19:32.334
More like "math-holes."

19:32.400 --> 19:34.301
There's no way
he's going here.

19:34.368 --> 19:35.634
Come on, jamie.
You ready?

19:38.268 --> 19:40.301
Thanks.

19:51.301 --> 19:52.900
What are you doing?

19:52.967 --> 19:54.733
You should be in bed.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.834
That's why
they call it "bed rest."

19:56.900 --> 19:58.234
The doctor said
take it easy.

19:58.301 --> 20:01.468
That doesn't mean i have to
spend every waking hour in bed.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.534
Um, yes, you do.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.367
So, does this mean

20:04.434 --> 20:06.167
you're not gonna give me
a ride to the studio?

20:07.468 --> 20:09.600
Um, you're not going
to the studio.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.633
Look, and i'm the one
with the car,

20:11.700 --> 20:13.800
and i'm not
driving you anywhere.

20:13.867 --> 20:16.267
End of discussion.

20:16.334 --> 20:17.534
Speaking of...

20:17.600 --> 20:19.800
have you had a chance
to go look at the comet yet?

20:19.867 --> 20:21.468
Yeah, about that...

20:21.534 --> 20:22.900
how bad?

20:22.967 --> 20:24.367
Well, i...

20:25.834 --> 20:27.534
we can get
another one, okay?

20:29.234 --> 20:33.067
It was just a car, peyton.

20:33.134 --> 20:34.434
That's all.

20:40.201 --> 20:42.134
It was the comet.

20:45.733 --> 20:48.468
They put our son
in a cardigan.

20:48.534 --> 20:50.434
I used to wear
cardigans.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.867
And that's because
you were a nerd.

20:52.934 --> 20:55.034
See, it's comments like that
that make me wish

20:55.101 --> 20:57.700
i'd had an opportunity to go
to a school like oppenheimer.

20:57.767 --> 21:01.267
Oh, yeah, and then you could
have lettered in math-ketball.

21:01.334 --> 21:04.034
Look, that little jackass
was talking trash to our son.

21:04.101 --> 21:05.700
Like you've never
talked trash before?

21:05.767 --> 21:07.134
And when somebody talks trash
to you on the court,

21:07.201 --> 21:08.967
doesn't it motivate you?

21:09.034 --> 21:11.434
<i>You know it does.
Well, jamie's not even gonna
see a court, all right?</i>

21:11.501 --> 21:12.700
'cause they don't even
have one.

21:12.767 --> 21:14.667
He would get
an excellent education there,

21:14.733 --> 21:16.733
and there is more to school
than just sports.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.434
Well, there's more to school
than just school.

21:18.501 --> 21:20.468
This coming
from a "c" student.

21:20.534 --> 21:22.367
A "c" plus.

21:22.434 --> 21:24.867
And you were my tutor.

21:37.501 --> 21:39.401
Ah, there's the man.

21:39.468 --> 21:41.800
So, how did your visit go
at that new school?

21:43.034 --> 21:45.600
I haven't
told anyone yet.

21:45.667 --> 21:46.700
Hey, i'm sorry,
little man.

21:46.767 --> 21:47.667
I didn't realize
this whole thing

21:47.733 --> 21:48.568
was supposed to be
on the d.l.

21:48.633 --> 21:50.900
Extreme d.l.

21:52.201 --> 21:54.800
Hey. I'm lauren.
I'm jamie's teacher.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.201
Hi, i'm...

21:56.267 --> 21:58.101
jamie's basketball coach,
skills.

21:58.167 --> 22:00.633
Antwon...taylor ...

22:00.700 --> 22:02.834
antwon "skills" taylor.
Yes, i know.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.468
Jamie talks about you
all the time.

22:04.534 --> 22:06.800
You know, he says you're not
very good at video games.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.301
Yes, i am.

22:09.633 --> 22:12.800
I don't really play that much
unless jamie want to play.

22:12.867 --> 22:14.134
I let him win sometimes.

22:14.201 --> 22:15.900
You know, got to keep
the kid's confidence up.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.101
Oh, of course.
I'll see you tomorrow, jamie.

22:19.167 --> 22:21.301
Antwon "skills" taylor.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.434
Man!

22:25.501 --> 22:27.434
You sure you want
to leave this school?

22:35.067 --> 22:36.900
Well, well.

22:36.967 --> 22:37.934
Peyton.

22:41.201 --> 22:43.934
So, looks like all that good
music we've been working on

22:44.000 --> 22:45.201
nearly killed you.

22:45.267 --> 22:47.534
Yeah, good music and some idiot
running a red light.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.867
Yeah, brooke told me
about the accident...

22:49.934 --> 22:52.867
and, uh...
about everything else.

22:52.934 --> 22:55.501
It's all gonna
work out, haley.

22:55.568 --> 22:57.867
I know it will. You and lucas
always beat the odds.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.867
Hey, i'm gonna need your help
with something.

23:01.934 --> 23:03.434
Anything.

23:03.501 --> 23:06.367
Finish producing
mia's album.

23:06.434 --> 23:08.800
Of course.

23:08.867 --> 23:10.568
Because you are the one
that discovered her
in the first place.

23:10.633 --> 23:14.201
Well, we both did.
We're a team, remember?

23:15.800 --> 23:18.167
I'll be there in spirit.
Deal?

23:18.234 --> 23:19.334
Deal.

23:19.401 --> 23:20.667
I will take care of mia,

23:20.733 --> 23:22.667
and you will take care
of my niece.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.800
Or nephew,
but i'm hoping for a niece.

23:24.867 --> 23:25.934
Thank you.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.434
You're welcome.

23:37.468 --> 23:39.501
Hey.

23:43.667 --> 23:46.767
What are you
so gloomy about?

23:46.834 --> 23:49.800
Jack found a foster home.

23:49.867 --> 23:53.201
He's leaving today.
He's moving to charlotte.

23:53.267 --> 23:57.334
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard.

23:57.401 --> 24:00.000
Believe me, i know.

24:00.067 --> 24:02.568
Yeah,
if that's your story.

24:02.633 --> 24:05.301
Hey, what is that
supposed to mean?

24:07.101 --> 24:09.234
I think you know.

24:09.301 --> 24:11.800
Okay, if you want
to get into this,

24:11.867 --> 24:13.401
we should get into it.

24:13.468 --> 24:15.767
You have been moping
around the house

24:15.834 --> 24:17.167
for the last two weeks,

24:17.234 --> 24:19.568
pouting about julian.

24:19.633 --> 24:22.067
He wanted us
to be together.

24:22.134 --> 24:24.667
He wanted you.
He wanted me.

24:26.401 --> 24:27.934
We could have been
a family!

24:28.000 --> 24:30.234
Sam, you don't know
what you're talking about.

24:31.568 --> 24:33.401
I know he loves you.

24:33.468 --> 24:36.733
I know ...
i know to follow my heart

24:36.800 --> 24:38.600
instead of
locking it away.

24:39.800 --> 24:43.101
<i>I know if i could,
i would go with jack.</i>

24:43.167 --> 24:46.568
Sam, you're in high school.

24:46.633 --> 24:50.301
Your love
is totally different,

24:50.367 --> 24:52.934
and if you were older,
you would understand.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.900
Do you know
who you sound like?

24:55.967 --> 24:57.234
Victoria.

24:57.301 --> 24:59.234
Okay.

24:59.301 --> 25:03.334
That is a cheap shot,
and you know it.

25:03.401 --> 25:05.800
It is so much
more complicated

25:05.867 --> 25:08.568
than me just doing
whatever i want.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.301
Why?
Because of me?

25:10.367 --> 25:12.501
<i>Not because of you.</i>

25:12.568 --> 25:13.800
<i>For you.</i>

25:13.867 --> 25:16.633
I have to do
what is best for you,

25:16.700 --> 25:19.101
whether or not
you see that.

25:19.167 --> 25:21.434
Don't use me
as your excuse!

25:21.501 --> 25:22.967
Please, just stop!

25:25.867 --> 25:29.468
Please, just admit
that julian loved you

25:29.534 --> 25:34.301
and you were too scared
or too stupid to love him back!

25:41.468 --> 25:44.667
Tell me
about miss lauren.
If you let me score,
i'll tell you all about her.

25:47.534 --> 25:49.301
Thank you.

25:49.367 --> 25:50.934
Get to talking.

25:51.000 --> 25:51.934
She likes flowers.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.367
Man, every girl
likes flowers.

25:53.434 --> 25:54.667
I need more than that.

25:54.733 --> 25:57.101
If i give up everything,
i'll have no bargaining power.

25:57.167 --> 25:58.700
It's called
"supply and demand."

25:58.767 --> 26:00.700
Oh, you pretty smart
for a 6-year-old.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.000
Haven't you heard?
I'm a genius.

26:03.067 --> 26:05.401
Kid's smarter
than both of us, skills.

26:05.468 --> 26:07.134
Yeah, he definitely
gets that from his mama.

26:07.201 --> 26:08.301
Can't argue with that.

26:10.334 --> 26:12.468
Hey.

26:12.534 --> 26:14.067
Can we talk?

26:14.134 --> 26:15.301
Yeah, sure.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.633
You got this, skills?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.733
I got this.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.800
All right, one on four.
It's my ball.

26:24.468 --> 26:26.600
Hey.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.867
Um, so,
i was thinking ...

26:28.934 --> 26:30.101
me too.

26:30.167 --> 26:33.101
Um, i think i was a little harsh
about the new school.

26:33.167 --> 26:34.733
Great,
because i was thinking

26:34.800 --> 26:37.733
it's probably not such
a great idea to send him there.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.101
Why the change of heart?

26:39.167 --> 26:42.101
Because he loves basketball,
and he likes his teacher.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.967
He's got
all his friends there.

26:44.034 --> 26:46.800
And would you rather him be
a big fish in a little pond

26:46.867 --> 26:48.667
or a little fish
in a big pond?

26:48.733 --> 26:50.733
That's the same reason
dan gave

26:50.800 --> 26:53.234
for not sending me
to oak lake academy.

26:54.900 --> 26:58.334
We want jamie to be a big fish
in a big pond.

26:58.401 --> 27:00.867
Dan never gave me
that option.

27:00.934 --> 27:02.201
Maybe jamie deserves

27:02.267 --> 27:05.067
to have all the opportunities
we didn't have, you know?

27:06.633 --> 27:08.733
So, basically,
we just flip-flopped?

27:08.800 --> 27:10.301
Yeah, i guess we did.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.700
We suck at this.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.367
Well, it's not like
we can't visit.

27:33.434 --> 27:36.201
We could meet up somewhere like
coachella during spring break.

27:36.267 --> 27:41.034
Yeah, and ...  and ...  and bonnaroo
is the last week of school.

27:41.101 --> 27:42.834
I don't like finals
anyway.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.800
Yeah, well, you'd have to
actually go to school

27:44.867 --> 27:45.934
to have finals.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.667
True.

27:47.733 --> 27:50.134
Oh, and we can ...
we can do reading in august.

27:50.201 --> 27:51.700
Yeah,
going across the pond.

27:51.767 --> 27:54.401
Uh, wait, are we gonna be back
in time for burning man?

27:54.468 --> 27:58.067
Oh, burning man's for freaks,
so you should definitely go.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.534
<i>You're the freak.</i>

28:06.867 --> 28:09.301
I'm gonna get you
a refill.

28:09.367 --> 28:12.167
Oh. What?

28:12.234 --> 28:13.401
Chicken.

28:17.733 --> 28:19.167
Hi.

28:19.234 --> 28:20.667
So, i've been wondering,

28:20.733 --> 28:23.900
how exactly did you con
my daughter into taking you in?

28:26.034 --> 28:27.934
I shoplifted
from clothes over bros,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.534
assaulted her, then she found me
sleeping in a car

28:30.600 --> 28:31.934
and decided to take me in.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.568
But i've made up for that
with my sunny disposition.

28:34.633 --> 28:37.367
I'm amused
on the inside.

28:37.434 --> 28:38.867
I'm not.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.401
Well, you should be.

28:40.468 --> 28:43.067
You hit the jackpot
with my daughter.

28:43.134 --> 28:44.401
Why so morose?

28:44.468 --> 28:45.967
I'm not sure
you'd understand.

28:46.034 --> 28:47.733
You'd have to actually
have a soul.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.534
Try me.

28:54.367 --> 28:57.234
My friend jack is leaving.

28:57.301 --> 29:00.034
He's...moving away.

29:01.267 --> 29:04.067
Well, my company is called
clothes over bros,

29:04.134 --> 29:07.067
so i'm not exactly sympathetic
with your cause.

29:07.134 --> 29:09.000
I should have known
you'd be bad at this,

29:09.067 --> 29:11.367
considering all the hurtful
things you said to brooke

29:11.434 --> 29:12.568
the last time you saw her.

29:12.633 --> 29:14.434
What would you know
about that?

29:14.501 --> 29:16.667
You said
you never wanted her.

29:16.733 --> 29:19.468
Not exactly
"mother of the year" material.

29:19.534 --> 29:21.067
<i>And what happened
to your mother?</i>

29:22.401 --> 29:23.733
She bailed.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.167
So, which
would you prefer ...

29:25.234 --> 29:26.867
a mother who left you

29:26.934 --> 29:30.434
or a mother who stuck around
and was bad at it?

29:44.501 --> 29:45.934
Where's my coffee?

29:47.867 --> 29:49.633
You're too short anyway.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.334
How horrible was she?

29:53.401 --> 29:56.434
Uh...i-i don't know.

30:01.034 --> 30:02.600
Hiya, sawyer, p.e.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.600
Hiya back, davis, b.p.

30:06.534 --> 30:07.534
How are you feeling?

30:07.600 --> 30:08.633
Oh, pretty good.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.733
Lucas keeps hounding me
to stay in bed.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.067
We're having
a little difference of opinion

30:13.134 --> 30:14.934
of what
"taking it easy" means.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.967
Well, now that we know
i'm doing fine,

30:19.034 --> 30:20.367
what's going on with you?

30:20.434 --> 30:23.000
"Bitchtoria"
is back in town.

30:23.067 --> 30:26.867
She wants me to come back
and save the company.

30:26.934 --> 30:29.434
Victoria? Seriously?

30:29.501 --> 30:31.334
And the thing is,
if i don't help her,

30:31.401 --> 30:33.633
all those people
who work for clothes over bros

30:33.700 --> 30:35.434
are gonna lose their jobs.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.334
I mean...

30:38.401 --> 30:40.167
what do you think
i should do?

30:42.568 --> 30:45.501
I mean, i don't know
what you should do.

30:45.568 --> 30:48.000
<i>I know
what you will do, though.</i>

30:48.067 --> 30:50.067
And that is?

30:50.134 --> 30:53.367
You're gonna help
"vic-whoria."

30:54.600 --> 30:57.468
And you're gonna help
all those people

30:57.534 --> 31:01.267
because you always sacrifice
to help everybody else.

31:01.334 --> 31:03.468
That's why we love you.

31:10.267 --> 31:13.067
How i told you lately
how much leaving you sucks?

31:13.134 --> 31:16.201
I wish you could stay.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.600
We'll be the couple that makes
the long-distance thing work.

31:21.834 --> 31:24.101
We will, won't we?

31:24.167 --> 31:27.568
And every time we see each other
will be like a reunion.

31:27.633 --> 31:29.600
Yeah.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.534
I'll see you soon,
millie.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.067
Okay.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.633
Bye.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.267
Why?

32:06.967 --> 32:09.167
They're here.

32:13.834 --> 32:16.900
They're ...  they're much younger
than i expected.

32:16.967 --> 32:18.468
Hi, jack.

32:18.534 --> 32:20.501
Hi, how are you?
Good.

32:20.568 --> 32:22.434
Hey. Dad.

32:22.501 --> 32:23.934
Hey.
Yeah.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.733
Where'd you get the vampire
weekend tour shirt? Hot topic?

32:27.800 --> 32:30.468
No, bonnaroo.
Have you ever been?

32:30.534 --> 32:32.900
It's awesome.
Yeah, we go every year.

32:34.434 --> 32:35.568
Fine.

32:35.633 --> 32:36.967
You guys rock.
I'm impressed.

32:37.034 --> 32:39.900
So, you must be sam

32:39.967 --> 32:42.000
that dominates all
of jack's conversations.

32:42.067 --> 32:43.301
Oh, yeah.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.900
We were ...  we were hoping
to meet his girlfriend.

32:45.967 --> 32:48.267
She's not, uh,
my girlfriend.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.633
Yes, i am. Hi.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.501
Hi.
Hi.

32:51.568 --> 32:53.301
Nice to meet you.

32:53.367 --> 32:56.134
This is sam...

32:56.201 --> 32:58.201
my girlfriend.

32:59.501 --> 33:02.000
Well, uh, i hate
to spoil the goodbye,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.000
but, uh, we should
probably get going.

33:04.067 --> 33:05.301
Yeah, yeah.

33:05.367 --> 33:07.834
Um, you know what?
We'll be in the car, okay?

33:07.900 --> 33:10.534
Um, it was really nice
meeting you, sam.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.834
Yeah.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.934
So...

33:20.000 --> 33:22.967
i'll come back
as soon as i can.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.201
Coachella's in april.

33:29.301 --> 33:30.667
Okay.

33:33.034 --> 33:35.867
Uh, bye, sam.

33:38.201 --> 33:39.201
Bye.

33:51.934 --> 33:53.134
Jack!

33:55.468 --> 33:57.934
When you kissed me,
it wasn't...

34:00.667 --> 34:03.101
it was nice.

34:12.501 --> 34:14.400
That was, too.

34:48.516 --> 34:50.650
I don't want to leave.

34:50.717 --> 34:51.851
I like it here.

34:51.917 --> 34:53.583
You mean,
you don't want to leave

34:53.650 --> 34:56.851
and go back
to your pro-basketball career?

34:56.917 --> 34:58.018
You know what happened

34:58.084 --> 35:00.084
to the boy that got everything
he ever wanted?

35:00.183 --> 35:01.584
He lived happily
ever after.

35:01.651 --> 35:03.283
I know,
and i am happy.

35:03.350 --> 35:05.550
It's just there's
this new guy, nino,

35:05.617 --> 35:07.617
and he's a pain
in the ass.

35:07.684 --> 35:11.350
And bobby expects me to help him
transition to shooting guard.

35:12.851 --> 35:14.550
Well, i'm sure bobby
wouldn't have asked you to do it

35:14.617 --> 35:16.118
if he didn't think
you could handle it.

35:16.183 --> 35:18.250
I-i don't know, hales.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.384
Can i talk to you guys?

35:20.450 --> 35:21.517
Uh, yeah.

35:23.018 --> 35:26.350
What's on your genius of a mind,
little man?

35:26.417 --> 35:28.517
Well, i've been thinking
about everything.

35:28.584 --> 35:31.217
And i think i should get to pick
where i go to school.

35:31.283 --> 35:32.417
Is that right?

35:32.484 --> 35:35.784
Well, if you could pick,
where would you go?

35:35.851 --> 35:37.851
I want to stay
at my school.

35:37.917 --> 35:40.384
I like my friends.
I like my teacher.

35:40.450 --> 35:42.550
And besides,
i did good on that test

35:42.617 --> 35:44.617
because you guys
teach me stuff.

35:46.084 --> 35:47.951
And i like it that way.

35:48.018 --> 35:50.450
So, can i stay?

35:50.517 --> 35:51.951
Please?

35:52.018 --> 35:54.484
We'll talk about it.

35:54.550 --> 35:57.250
I really appreciate
you coming to us though, baby.

35:57.317 --> 35:58.717
Okay. Good night.

35:58.784 --> 36:00.684
Good night.
Love you.

36:02.784 --> 36:04.651
The kid makes
a lot of sense.

36:04.717 --> 36:07.250
Yeah, maybe we should have
asked him first

36:07.317 --> 36:08.617
since he's the genius.

36:10.283 --> 36:13.550
You know, you could learn
a thing or two from that kid.

36:13.617 --> 36:15.550
Well, he and chuck
used to hate each other,

36:15.617 --> 36:17.317
and now he doesn't want
to leave him.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.084
And your point?

36:19.150 --> 36:21.084
My point is that maybe
you should go back to charleston

36:21.150 --> 36:22.550
and play nice.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.817
All right.

36:32.018 --> 36:34.751
You think third time
is gonna be the charm?

36:34.817 --> 36:38.617
You know, i did forgive you
for falsely accusing me

36:38.684 --> 36:42.018
and trying to intimidate me
with a firearm.

36:42.084 --> 36:44.450
<i>And you think
i'm gonna forgive you?</i>

36:44.517 --> 36:46.183
I hope so.

36:49.617 --> 36:50.951
Okay.

36:51.018 --> 36:52.584
Here's the deal ...

36:52.651 --> 36:56.584
i'll come back to the company
for 51% ownership.

36:56.651 --> 36:58.084
50/50.

36:58.150 --> 36:59.084
52.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.183
51.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.784
Fine.

37:01.851 --> 37:05.384
But understand,
this is business.

37:05.450 --> 37:07.984
You still don't have
a daughter.

37:24.183 --> 37:26.684
Nice shot.

37:26.751 --> 37:27.717
I know.

37:29.584 --> 37:32.150
Why does it always have to be
so hard with you?

37:34.250 --> 37:36.350
Look, you're good,
but i can make you better.

37:36.417 --> 37:38.051
With me at the point,
you're gonna get

37:38.118 --> 37:39.550
more chances to score,
all right?

37:39.617 --> 37:40.717
I'll get you the ball.

37:40.784 --> 37:44.150
All you have to do
is knock down the shots.

37:44.217 --> 37:45.951
Oh, i'll knock down
the shots.

37:48.450 --> 37:50.417
All right.

37:50.484 --> 37:52.118
Well, good,
'cause if you can do that,

37:52.183 --> 37:54.051
the scouts will come,
we'll both get noticed,

37:54.118 --> 37:56.550
and, hopefully, we'll never have
to play with each other again.

38:02.917 --> 38:06.051
Okay, point.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.183
Teach me something.

38:13.283 --> 38:15.517
We'll start with this move
i got in the other day.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.484
I'm gonna ...  i'm gonna
plant my foot here.

38:17.550 --> 38:19.584
As i drive,
like i'm going in for the drive,

38:19.651 --> 38:21.283
i'm just gonna spin around you
and square up

38:21.350 --> 38:22.717
and take a jumper.

38:40.317 --> 38:42.851
Who's the flowers for?

38:42.917 --> 38:44.817
A girl.

38:44.884 --> 38:47.651
Strong.

38:47.717 --> 38:49.051
For you, miss lauren.

Oh, wow.
Thank you, jamie.

38:52.484 --> 38:55.384
They're not from me.
They're from my uncle skills.

38:55.450 --> 38:56.717
He thinks you're cute.

39:06.617 --> 39:07.917
I'm staying!

Morning, marvin.

39:15.118 --> 39:16.717
Morning, millie.

40:04.084 --> 40:05.550
What are you guys
doing here?

40:05.617 --> 40:06.584
Hey, we're a team.

40:06.651 --> 40:08.283
You can't come
to the studio, so...

40:08.350 --> 40:10.784
we brought the studio
to you.

40:10.851 --> 40:14.751
Sorry, but "in spirit"
just wouldn't do.

40:14.817 --> 40:18.417
What do you want
to hear?

40:18.484 --> 40:20.684
Something great.

41:16.550 --> 41:17.951
He's gone.

41:18.018 --> 41:19.917
Everything's
gonna be okay.
