Megasaurus 5000!

00:12.650 --> 00:14.420
Megasaurus 5000!

00:15.760 --> 00:17.590
New toy?

00:17.620 --> 00:21.460
Can you imagine getting so excited
about something so stupid?

00:21.500 --> 00:25.670
Ooh! New bff quiz on the
<i>flossy teen</i> website!

00:27.570 --> 00:30.310
Batteries!
I need batteries!

00:36.720 --> 00:39.690
Hey, I thought we were both
going to take the bff quiz.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.660
Rocky, we're best friends
and dance partners.

00:42.690 --> 00:45.630
Trust me, I know all your answers.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.600
Oh, really?
Well...

00:48.640 --> 00:50.640
That's right.
And that's right.

00:50.670 --> 00:51.710
I never did that!

00:52.810 --> 00:54.810
Oh, yeah, I did.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.720
See? I know you better
than you know you.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.690
You know, sometimes you
can be really annoying.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.690
I know, I put that down for number nine.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.590
I know myself, too.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.460
Ladies, behold the megasaurus 5000!

01:09.500 --> 01:11.530
Big whoop.
It's a toy dinosaur.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.430
A toy dinosaur!
For your information,

01:14.470 --> 01:17.330
the megasaurus 5000 is an amazing,

01:17.370 --> 01:19.570
state of the art,
intelligent cyber-toy

01:19.600 --> 01:22.340
that makes all other toys seem meaningless.

01:22.370 --> 01:24.640
It roars, it climbs, it attacks.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.540
Hold on to your hats!

01:33.750 --> 01:35.760
If I were you, I'd hold on to your receipt.

Oh, guys, have I told you lately

02:40.180 --> 02:42.420
how lucky I am to work with
all you fantastic people?

02:42.450 --> 02:44.250
Oh, save it, Gary.

02:44.290 --> 02:48.490
We're not
again.Lect dead pigeonsy

02:48.530 --> 02:50.430
tinka, why so negative?

02:50.460 --> 02:52.500
Do you have with your inner child?

02:52.530 --> 02:56.170
Forget her inner child,
I have issues with. D

02:57.200 --> 02:58.440
so, dr. Phil,
what's going on?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.240
I've been working on myself.

03:00.270 --> 03:05.210
I knew it!
It's taylor lautner's! Ose.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.110
I meant I've been seeing
great.Apist and she's

03:09.150 --> 03:10.280
you go to a shrink?

03:10.320 --> 03:12.020
Sure, why not?

03:12.050 --> 03:15.250
The topic of conversation,
45 minutes a week, is me!

03:15.290 --> 03:18.060
Does she make you
you're boring? Use

03:19.160 --> 03:21.290
you know, kind of mean.

03:21.330 --> 03:24.190
Maybe that's why nobody likes you.

03:24.230 --> 03:28.370
Anyway, my therapist is offering a
free session if anybody's interested.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.470
No, thanks. Gotta go.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.110
Uh, actually,

03:34.140 --> 03:37.510
rocky and I haven't been
getting along lately.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.210
What? Yes, we have.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.210
See? She argues
about everything.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.480
It's starting to affect
our dancing. Hmm.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.190
That's not true.
Denial!

03:49.220 --> 03:52.090
Anyway, we would love
to see your therapist.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.390
Great, if your parents are cool with
it, I'll go get you her number.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.360
Yes!

03:57.400 --> 04:00.530
Wait, so you just decide we're going
to therapy and you don't even ask me?

04:00.570 --> 04:03.470
Look, it's a great way to bond with gary.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.140
We go see his shrink, the
next thing you know, boom!

04:06.170 --> 04:09.140
We'll get the big solo moment
in this week's finale.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.210
Or we come up with new dance moves,

04:11.250 --> 04:13.310
rehearse them, really impress gary

04:13.350 --> 04:16.120
and actually earn that solo moment.

04:16.149 --> 04:18.350
You call that a plan?

04:18.390 --> 04:20.519
Wow, you really do need therapy.

04:27.260 --> 04:30.200
Come on!
Do something!

04:30.230 --> 04:32.330
What's wrong?
Your tyrannosaurus wrecked?

04:34.140 --> 04:37.500
It's not funny. The megasaurus
5000 is a piece of garbage.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.140
Why don't you tell someone who cares?

04:40.170 --> 04:42.410
You don't have to be mean about it.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.080
I wasn't.
It says on the box,

04:45.110 --> 04:47.180
"tell us your opinion.
We care."

04:48.450 --> 04:50.120
Here.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.290
<i>Imagination toy company.</i>

04:54.320 --> 04:58.090
Hi, I recently purchased
your megasaurus 5000

04:58.120 --> 05:00.490
and I just wanted to say it stinks!

05:00.530 --> 05:03.230
I think you're ripping kids
off and I won't stand for it.

05:03.260 --> 05:05.030
So what do you have to say to that?

05:05.070 --> 05:08.070
<i>If you'd like to speak</i> <i>to a live
representative,</i> <i>say "one."</i>

05:09.500 --> 05:11.300
One.

05:11.340 --> 05:15.170
<i>Okay, let me make</i> <i>sure I understand you.
</i> <i>Did you say "three"?</i>

05:16.510 --> 05:19.280
One! One! One!

05:19.310 --> 05:21.520
<i>Did you want</i>
<i>accounts payable?</i>

05:23.280 --> 05:26.150
No! One!

05:26.190 --> 05:31.060
<i>Connecting you</i>
<i>to no one. Goodbye.</i>

05:31.090 --> 05:33.390
Wow!
Their phone system works

05:33.430 --> 05:36.160
just about as well
as their megasaurus 5000.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.130
I think it's time I pay them a visit

05:39.170 --> 05:42.100
and show them I'm not some
little kid they can push around.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.270
Good for you.
I'll take you down there right now.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.510
Thanks. Just let me make a quick
wee-wee and grab a juice box.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.520
Hello, girls.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.120
I'm dr. Pepper.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.420
Dr. pepper?

06:01.460 --> 06:02.490
That's like the...

06:02.520 --> 06:05.090
No jokes.
I've heard it all before

06:05.130 --> 06:07.360
and it just brings up
bad childhood memories.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.130
So, why'd you come to see me?

06:12.170 --> 06:16.300
Well, actually, I'm not
even sure why we're here.

06:16.340 --> 06:19.270
What she means is...

06:19.310 --> 06:22.140
Why are any of us here?

06:23.180 --> 06:26.210
Well, maybe this will tell us.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.010
What do you see?

06:28.050 --> 06:32.120
That someone has a really
good taste in art!

06:32.150 --> 06:35.320
Hmm. Looks like we've got a
people-pleaser on our hands.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.460
And you, Rocky?
What do you see?

06:38.490 --> 06:42.060
A cloud.
No, a cotton ball.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.060
No, a rabbit backing up.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.130
I did not know that there
was going to be a test!

06:48.070 --> 06:49.440
Are you writing down what I just said?

06:49.470 --> 06:51.470
Because there's nothing wrong with me, okay?
I'm totally normal.

06:51.510 --> 06:55.140
Why aren't you writing that down?

06:55.180 --> 06:58.510
Actually, I was just watching
cartoons on my tablet.

06:58.550 --> 07:02.120
Boy, I wish I could meet a
guy like Fred flintstone.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.290
But we're not here to
talk about my love life,

07:05.320 --> 07:07.420
we're here to dig into your psyches.

07:09.290 --> 07:12.160
So, what cartoon characters
do you have crushes on?

07:16.470 --> 07:19.300
And now, our newest toy.

07:19.330 --> 07:22.240
Mr. monkey head!

07:24.140 --> 07:26.270
I want my 19.95 back!

07:28.040 --> 07:31.140
This megasaurus made me
mega-sorry I ever bought it.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.150
Yeah. And he made me
spring for a cab,

07:35.180 --> 07:38.180
so add another 10 bucks to the total.

07:38.220 --> 07:42.120
The megasaurus is our best seller.
Kids love it.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.260
I took a soccer ball to the face once.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.160
It was more fun than this.

07:47.390 --> 07:49.090
Hey, what's that?

07:49.130 --> 07:51.400
It's the next big thing.
Here.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.430
Tap him on the head.

08:02.340 --> 08:05.040
Hey, this would be great to play with.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.480
If you couldn't fall asleep at night.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.010
What do you think it should do?

08:10.050 --> 08:12.350
How should I know?
I'm only eight.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.050
But since you ask,

08:16.090 --> 08:17.350
I'd make it a whole monkey,

08:17.390 --> 08:20.390
dress it in a suit, have
him eat plastic bananas

08:20.420 --> 08:23.230
and then have them come
out the other end peeled.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.360
I'd buy that toy.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.400
Brilliant!

08:29.430 --> 08:33.169
And who knows kids' toys better than kids?

08:34.039 --> 08:36.210
Hey, how would you...

08:36.240 --> 08:38.080
Oh, uh, here.

08:40.150 --> 08:44.420
How would you like to be our
vp in charge of toy testing?

08:44.450 --> 08:46.120
We'll take it.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.320
We?

08:47.350 --> 08:49.490
Yeah. I need a car, and you're
gonna need an assistant.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.090
Can you type?
No.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.290
Can you make a spreadsheet?
No.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.430
Do you remember how to
get home from here? Yes.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.130
You're hired.
Nice.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.200
Hello, baby!

09:05.240 --> 09:08.440
Congrats on your new job wiping things up.

09:08.480 --> 09:13.080
How nice that you found a place
where your mediocrity can shine.

09:13.110 --> 09:15.080
Oops. Missed a spot.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.980
You guys are mean!

09:18.380 --> 09:21.220
Deja ooh!

09:21.250 --> 09:23.260
Remember how Gary said that we were mean

09:23.290 --> 09:25.390
and that's why people didn't like us?

09:25.430 --> 09:27.360
Maybe we should try being nice.

09:27.390 --> 09:30.100
To everyone?

09:31.300 --> 09:34.030
We'll start with Deuce and see how it goes.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.170
Deuce!

09:37.070 --> 09:41.010
Thank you for your time and good service.
Here is your tip.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.240
Yeah. Like I'm
gonna fall for that!

09:43.280 --> 09:45.410
Obviously, it's attached to a string,

09:45.440 --> 09:48.080
I'm going to reach for it,
you're going to pull it away

09:48.110 --> 09:51.050
and I'm gonna look like some type of idiot.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.150
No. We just decided
to be nice to you.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.320
Oh. I'm sorry.

09:56.350 --> 09:58.220
Well, in that case...

10:00.120 --> 10:01.290
Starting now.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.060
And all the kids in school were so mean.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.370
None of the girls would
double dutch with me.

10:10.540 --> 10:14.070
You know how hard it is to single dutch?

10:16.070 --> 10:18.410
I used to love to skip...
It's not about you!

10:21.110 --> 10:22.410
You know what?
You're right.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.110
I'm sorry.
We're wasting your time.

10:24.150 --> 10:26.120
We really don't have any
issues with each other.

10:26.150 --> 10:30.320
But as long as we're here, why not find
out for sure with a few trust exercises?

10:30.350 --> 10:32.490
Cece, you stand behind Rocky.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.290
Rocky, just let yourself fall back into
Cece's arms and let her catch you.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.460
See? Told you we don't have
any issues with each other.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.430
My turn!

10:45.270 --> 10:46.530
Oh!

10:48.170 --> 10:50.240
Sorry, Cece!
That was just an accident.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.170
There are no accidents.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.310
No, I was just distracted.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.080
By your true feelings?
No, she was slippery.

10:55.110 --> 10:56.140
What're you hiding?
Nothing.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.250
Why are you so angry?
I'm not!

10:57.280 --> 10:59.510
Then why are you here?
Because Cece made me!

10:59.550 --> 11:02.250
Okay? She's always pushing me
around and telling me what to do

11:02.290 --> 11:04.320
and I just can't take it anymore!

11:05.360 --> 11:08.460
Okay, maybe we do have some issues.

11:08.730 --> 11:09.900
You think?

11:18.630 --> 11:20.230
Ow!
Ow!

11:21.400 --> 11:22.700
Can we take a five?

11:24.230 --> 11:25.600
You were supposed to snake left.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.400
No, you're supposed to snake right.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.640
I did snake right.
You snaked...

11:29.670 --> 11:31.670
Wrong!

11:31.710 --> 11:35.510
Girls, girls, it doesn't
matter who missnook

11:35.550 --> 11:37.510
as long as you're okay.

11:37.550 --> 11:40.380
Tinka!

11:40.420 --> 11:42.550
You promised we only had
to be nice to Deuce.

11:42.590 --> 11:44.420
Oh, right.

11:44.450 --> 11:46.490
Stop messing up, cake for brains.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.430
Like a strudel!

11:49.460 --> 11:52.530
What is with you two today?
You're really out of sync.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.600
You know, I was thinking of giving
you the big moment at the end,

11:54.630 --> 11:57.370
but now, not so sure.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.600
Don't worry, Gary.
We're working with your therapist

11:59.640 --> 12:01.570
and she'll get us right back on track.

12:03.410 --> 12:05.640
Yeah, like we'd ever really
go back to that therapist.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.380
Actually, I booked us a second appointment.

12:08.410 --> 12:12.250
And you didn't even ask me?
Who do you think you are?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.450
Hmm, let's see. You.

12:44.410 --> 12:46.650
Who knew playing with
toys was so much work?

12:46.680 --> 12:50.350
Okay, assistant, I'm exhausted.
Let's call it a day.

12:50.390 --> 12:52.290
You've been here an hour.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.320
You know what?
I'm sick of your attitude.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.660
You're fired.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.390
Big talk from someone who
can't take the bus alone.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.460
I'm sensing you're both
a little angry today.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.370
You know what makes me angry?

13:07.400 --> 13:11.300
When they run out of sweet and
sour sauce at the drive-through.

13:11.340 --> 13:14.240
Nothing worse than a dry nugget.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.440
Makes me wanna drive
through the restaurant.

13:18.310 --> 13:19.580
I just don't want to be here.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.350
Of course you don't.
Because this wasn't your idea.

13:22.390 --> 13:25.220
I'm trying to fix our dancing
and you don't seem to care.

13:25.260 --> 13:27.360
Sometimes you make me so
mad, I just want to...

13:27.390 --> 13:29.530
Hit her?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.530
Go on, you know you wanna.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.570
Are you sure you have a degree?

13:35.600 --> 13:39.200
Dr. pepper, hitting someone is never
the right way to solve a problem.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.670
It is

13:40.700 --> 13:44.540
when you use sanctioned,
therapeutic, giant boxing gloves!

13:44.580 --> 13:46.280
You're making this up.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.650
Am I?

13:48.680 --> 13:52.480
It's a great way to release anger.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.250
Um, I'm sorry, but Rocky and
I would never just start...

13:58.390 --> 14:00.560
Stop making all the decisions!

14:00.590 --> 14:02.690
Well, I wouldn't have to

14:02.730 --> 14:04.600
if you would just do something fun

14:04.630 --> 14:07.270
and stop making me beg you.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.600
Oh, you don't beg.

14:08.630 --> 14:12.340
You go behind my back and drag
me into ridiculous situations.

14:13.210 --> 14:16.610
Oh! Name one time

14:16.640 --> 14:20.280
I ever dragged you into anything.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.410
Well, let's see.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.580
You made me eat a giant
meatball the size of a car

14:25.620 --> 14:28.520
even though I'm a vegetarian.

14:28.550 --> 14:32.290
You made me sneak off to Gary's
party where I had to be a waitress.

14:33.690 --> 14:36.330
Oh! You tricked me into
getting on a bus to la

14:36.360 --> 14:38.560
and I wound up dancing on
the wing of an airplane

14:38.600 --> 14:40.300
in the air!

14:42.670 --> 14:45.470
Well, you left out
the time that I pushed you

14:45.500 --> 14:47.400
to audition for
<i>shake it up, Chicago!</i>

14:47.440 --> 14:49.310
And that turned out pretty good.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.610
You know what?

14:53.640 --> 14:57.610
We didn't even have any problems
before we started therapy.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.550
So come on, Rocky, let's go.

14:59.580 --> 15:02.650
I'm sorry, but from now on,
I make my own decisions.

15:02.690 --> 15:04.250
I'm staying.

15:04.290 --> 15:06.220
No, you're not.
Session's over, get out.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.640
Unbelievable.

15:19.670 --> 15:23.370
I work all day and there's no snack
waiting for me when I get home?

15:25.310 --> 15:30.250
Leave me alone. I had a very
emotional day in therapy with Rocky.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.550
So you lay on a couch complaining all day

15:32.580 --> 15:35.220
while I bust my butt
trying to earn a living?

15:36.590 --> 15:39.190
You don't understand.

15:39.220 --> 15:42.460
Rocky's all upset with me because
she thinks I boss her around.

15:42.490 --> 15:46.230
You've been friends since you were
five and she just figured that out?

15:46.260 --> 15:48.400
She may be smart, but she ain't quick.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.370
So it's true?

15:52.670 --> 15:54.440
Huh.

15:54.470 --> 15:56.370
Maybe I was being so defensive

15:56.410 --> 15:58.610
I wasn't even listening
to what she was saying.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.680
What a coincidence!
I'm not listening to what you're saying.

16:09.190 --> 16:10.590
Hey, deucey!

16:11.590 --> 16:13.390
It's present time!

16:13.430 --> 16:16.260
Guys, you've already
been way too nice to me.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.160
You carried my books to class,

16:18.200 --> 16:21.470
you bought me lunch, and when I
was done, you brushed my teeth.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.200
Don't forget we also flossed you.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.640
Yeah.
How can I forget that?

16:26.670 --> 16:29.370
Seriously, how can I forget that?

16:33.610 --> 16:35.580
So, what do you think?

16:36.650 --> 16:39.480
I... I...

16:39.520 --> 16:42.490
I love it!

16:42.520 --> 16:44.560
You know what? You know what?
Bring it in, bring it in!

16:44.590 --> 16:46.320
Come on, you guys, come on!

16:47.330 --> 16:51.460
Gunther, he is touching us.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.630
And getting snot on my shoulder.

16:53.670 --> 16:57.600
All right, now let's get out our
phones and sync our calendars!

16:57.640 --> 16:59.640
I'm clearing every weekend for you guys.

16:59.670 --> 17:04.609
Saturday and Sunday!
Did somebody say sleepover party?

17:05.640 --> 17:07.310
No. Nobody said that.

17:07.349 --> 17:11.579
Okay, then I'll say it.
Sleepover party!

17:11.619 --> 17:16.250
Now I remember why we were never nice.
Let's get out of here.

17:16.290 --> 17:19.390
Guys, wait!
Come back! Don't go!

17:19.420 --> 17:21.490
I knew that would
get rid of them. Yes!

17:27.470 --> 17:30.370
Hurry up and get dressed, little dude.
We're gonna be late for work.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.370
Yeah, about that...
I'm retired.

17:33.410 --> 17:35.370
But I'm saving up for a car

17:35.410 --> 17:37.340
and without you, they're gonna fire me.

17:37.380 --> 17:40.450
Of course they are.
You can't type, make a spreadsheet,

17:40.480 --> 17:43.210
and you got lost on the way home.

17:45.650 --> 17:47.450
Hi, Flynn.

17:47.490 --> 17:50.590
Uh, what do you think of our
new toy, the blimpy 5000?

17:50.620 --> 17:56.260
It's so much fun I could
play with it all day!

17:56.300 --> 18:00.200
You sound strange.
You feeling okay, Flynn?

18:00.230 --> 18:01.470
Never better!

18:08.380 --> 18:10.410
You're not Flynn.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.280
I had a growth spurt?

18:15.420 --> 18:18.390
In my professional opinion,
this relationship is toxic

18:18.420 --> 18:20.290
and has no chance of improving

18:20.320 --> 18:23.560
unless you come in and see me
at least three times a week.

18:25.390 --> 18:30.330
Look, we don't need any
more sessions after this.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.570
Rocky, you were right.
I do push you around,

18:32.600 --> 18:34.530
but only because I'm trying to help you.

18:34.570 --> 18:36.240
I didn't ask for your help.

18:36.270 --> 18:38.170
I know, I just feel like I owe you.

18:38.210 --> 18:39.410
For what?

18:39.440 --> 18:40.540
From when we first met.

18:40.570 --> 18:42.280
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:42.310 --> 18:44.310
Oh! The first time
you met?

18:44.350 --> 18:47.450
Sometimes, that's where the
root of the problem begins.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.350
And you thought I didn't have a degree.

18:50.620 --> 18:53.420
Go on, tell me what happened.

18:53.450 --> 18:55.620
Well, we were about five...

19:00.390 --> 19:02.230
Hi, I'm Cece.
What's your name?

19:02.260 --> 19:03.460
I'm Raquel.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.370
Too hard to say.
I'll call you Rocky.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.300
But my name's Raquel.

19:13.340 --> 19:14.570
Rocky's better.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.150
What's wrong?

19:22.180 --> 19:23.580
I'm quitting because I stink.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.520
No, you don't. You're great.
They stink!

19:33.660 --> 19:36.460
Stay in class and we can dance together.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.230
We'll make each other look good.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.500
Really? Okay. I will.

19:41.530 --> 19:43.370
Hey, you want to be best friends?

19:43.400 --> 19:44.500
Sure!

19:47.540 --> 19:49.540
You're the one that kept me dancing.

19:49.570 --> 19:51.510
Wait, so your plan is to repay me

19:51.540 --> 19:54.340
by making me do insane things
that always get me grounded?

19:55.580 --> 19:57.550
Yeah.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.520
Ever heard of a gift card?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.550
Rocky, if it wasn't for you

20:03.590 --> 20:06.420
I wouldn't be on
<i>shake it up, Chicago!</i>

20:06.460 --> 20:09.530
I wouldn't be getting to do the
thing I love most in the world.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.560
Dancing?

20:11.430 --> 20:12.500
No.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.230
Being your best friend.

20:16.670 --> 20:18.570
I'm so sorry.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.510
I'm sorry.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.310
Wow, I'm good.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.710
So, what do you say?
Put you down for three sessions a week?

20:29.350 --> 20:30.380
One session?

20:31.680 --> 20:34.490
Fine, who do I send the final bill to?

20:34.520 --> 20:35.720
Gary wilde!

21:35.350 --> 21:38.650
See you next week with more
<i>shake it up, Chicago!</i>

21:42.250 --> 21:43.690
Oh, you're totally back in sync!

21:43.720 --> 21:46.360
Yes, and we owe it all
to you and Dr. pepper.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.620
Who's Dr. pepper?

21:48.660 --> 21:52.260
What are you talking about?
She's the therapist you sent us to.

21:52.300 --> 21:55.430
I don't know what you're talking
about my therapist is Dr. novick.

22:00.270 --> 22:01.640
I think we need to call the police.

22:07.540 --> 22:09.510
This is boring.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.250
Yeah, I know.

22:11.280 --> 22:15.220
Hey, I brought
I can quiz you. Ards.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.250
Or...

22:24.230 --> 22:27.530
This is the first time
trouble.R gotten in

22:27.560 --> 22:30.430
stick with me, it won't be the last.
