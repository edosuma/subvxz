WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.103
[creaking]

00:06.507 --> 00:08.007
Perfect.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.512
Oh, hi, humans. Welcome aboard.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.348
[sighs]
It's a good thing
we went to the market.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.117
Are you comfortable?

00:18.119 --> 00:21.153
For the moment, if I've
arranged things right.

00:21.155 --> 00:24.690
I won't have to move
from this spot all day.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.359
I hope things
work out for you.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.894
Thanks. That means
a lot to me.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.131
Oh, darn.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.367
I just can't quite
seem to reach the VCR.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.871
Well, don't even think
about getting up

00:38.873 --> 00:40.906
I'll take care of it for you.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.108
Thanks, saves getting
a wrist full of..

00:45.312 --> 00:47.079
Jane Fonda's workout.

00:47.081 --> 00:50.349
I like to watch her
while I drink my coffee.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.818
Listen, grab a plate
and help yourself.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.987
The forks are chilled.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.989
Maybe later.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.490
Cracker?

00:58.492 --> 00:59.925
[doorbell dings]

00:59.927 --> 01:02.161
That's probably
the doorbell.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.931
Uh, well, whoever it is
I'll get rid of 'em.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.600
I mean, we can't have
anyone disturbing you.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.170
Yeah, tell 'em to take a hike.

01:13.007 --> 01:14.573
Mom!

01:18.412 --> 01:20.979
So good to see you.

01:22.049 --> 01:25.084
[theme music]

01:49.443 --> 01:50.876
[music continues]

02:24.078 --> 02:25.244
It's my mother.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.278
Grandma!

02:26.280 --> 02:27.746
Not your grandma.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.848
Lynn and Brian's grandma.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.118
Oh! What brings her
out this way?

02:33.120 --> 02:36.155
ALF, the kitchen,
the kitchen, now.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.923
Alright, huh!

02:37.925 --> 02:39.758
Willie, grab the pasta maker.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.860
Just go!

02:41.862 --> 02:43.762
- Who's at the door?
- Grandma.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.963
Where is she?

02:44.965 --> 02:46.932
They're making her
stand outside.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.001
- Get out! Get out!
- Go!

02:54.108 --> 02:56.675
Mom! Come in.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.610
Are you sure?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.112
Mom..

03:00.114 --> 03:02.014
- It's been too long.
- Oh, I know.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.783
- What a surprise!
- Yes, a long time.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.018
- Oh!
- Hi!

03:06.020 --> 03:08.620
- Hi, grandma.
- 'Lynn, Brian!'

03:08.622 --> 03:11.657
- Grandma!
- Give me a hug!

03:11.659 --> 03:13.959
- Are they feeding you?
- Yeah.

03:13.961 --> 03:17.029
Obviously not enough,
that was a very weak hug.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.666
Mmm! I like that one.
That was good.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.234
Hi, grandma.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.302
Another weak hug.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.636
Oh.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.305
Better.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.739
Hi, Dorothy.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.374
Hello, Willie.

03:32.346 --> 03:37.049
Anyway, I am off to Hawaii
with crazy Estelle.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.651
And we figured we'd spend
three days in Los Angeles

03:39.653 --> 03:43.488
while she visits her daughter,
I'm visiting my daughter.

03:43.490 --> 03:47.659
Oh, honey, that hair is much
too short for that face.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.328
You look good too, mom.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.097
I'm so glad you're
here for lunch.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.700
Tell me, what's your mother
feeding you these days?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.034
Oh, good food!

03:56.036 --> 03:58.437
- Sandwiches!
- Sandwiches?

03:58.439 --> 04:01.773
Well, listen, tonight I'm gonna
make you something substantial.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.343
Mom, I'm, uh,
I'm cooking dinner tonight.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.279
Oh, listen,
we'll talk about it later.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.314
Oh, I brought gifts!

04:09.883 --> 04:11.750
- Gifts?
- No!

04:14.054 --> 04:16.255
- I always brings gifts.
- I meant..

04:16.257 --> 04:20.459
No, no, you needn't
have brought any.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.394
I didn't bring any for you.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.630
I thought you'd be on the road.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.198
Why would I be on the road?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.533
Well, you are a salesman,
aren't you?

04:28.535 --> 04:32.638
No, no, I-I work in
social services.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.539
Mom, you knew that.

04:34.541 --> 04:38.043
That's right. I don't know
what I was thinking of.

04:38.045 --> 04:41.346
Willy Loman,
"Death of a Salesman."

04:43.217 --> 04:46.985
I know. Crazy Estelle's
son-in-law crazy Steve.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.288
He is a salesman,
and he does very well.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.258
Okay, Brian.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.560
Here you go.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.095
A scarf!

04:57.097 --> 04:59.097
That's right.
Hand knitted by grandma.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.733
I remembered how cold
it gets in here.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.737
Mom, the house
doesn't get that cold.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.272
Oh, honey, maybe not for you

05:07.274 --> 05:10.442
but these children
have no body fat.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.445
Here you go, Lynn. This will
keep you nice and warm.

05:13.447 --> 05:18.450
Oh, thanks, grandma.
It's beautiful and...thick.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.186
It's very important for children
to wear warm clothing.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.455
I cannot emphasize that enough.

05:23.457 --> 05:28.360
Mom, the children have
plenty of warm clothing.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.761
As a matter of fact
we just bought them

05:29.763 --> 05:31.463
new jackets and sweaters.

05:31.465 --> 05:35.634
Honey, you cannot get really
warm clothing in a store.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.203
Well, so far the kids have
been able to survive

05:38.205 --> 05:42.774
these brutal Southern California
winters, mom.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.976
Kate, are you being sarcastic?

05:44.978 --> 05:47.446
Yes, I am being
a little bit--

05:47.448 --> 05:49.114
Darling, that is so..

05:49.116 --> 05:50.215
(together)
...unbecoming.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.951
I hope we're not gonna fight.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.488
Maybe grandma should
stay with crazy Estelle.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.224
No, grandma, stay with us.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.360
Momma won't fight with you.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.294
Will you, mom?

06:02.296 --> 06:05.197
No, no, I don't
wanna fight.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.833
Well, good.
Neither does grandma.

06:07.835 --> 06:11.470
Okay, you kids help me
with my luggage.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.705
- Okay!
- Here you go, Brian.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.374
And tonight..

06:15.376 --> 06:19.111
...I'm gonna make you
a nice, home cooked dinner.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.718
Well, mother is here.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.653
It's only for
a couple of days.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.655
Yeah, I know.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.091
Yo! I have a question.

06:33.093 --> 06:37.129
Is grandma staying here
going to affect me in anyway?

06:38.499 --> 06:44.002
Help! I'm locked in a garage.
I'm-I'm without food.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.538
Someone please call
Mike's Pizza Barge

06:46.540 --> 06:50.041
and order one humongous,
with everything on it.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.343
Yeah.. Oh, yeah, wait a minute.

06:51.345 --> 06:54.579
Make that everything,
except beets.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.915
Emphasize that. No beets!

06:57.918 --> 07:01.253
Oh, never mind,
my jailers are here.

07:01.255 --> 07:04.923
It's about time.
I was beginning to feel faint.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.259
Many pardons
for the delay, Lord Shumway.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.098
He must be hungry.
He didn't even say grace.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.101
Grace.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.942
Great food, Kate.
You finally learned how to cook.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.710
My mother made that.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.547
Really? I'd like to meet her.

07:28.549 --> 07:32.284
ALF, you're gonna have to stay
in the garage for a few days.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.719
Why, because I insulted
your mom's cooking?

07:34.721 --> 07:37.722
Come on. Let the punishment
fit the crime.

07:37.724 --> 07:42.394
ALF, uh, you, uh, you can't come
back into the house because uh..

07:42.396 --> 07:45.897
...my mother is going to be
staying with us until Tuesday.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.899
Let her stay
in the garage.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.735
Well, I can't let my mother
sleep in a garage.

07:50.737 --> 07:54.072
Alright. Let the mutant
sleep in the garage.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.174
We don't think you as a mutant.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.443
- You think of me as your son?
- No.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.746
So I'm somewhere between
a mutant and your son?

08:01.748 --> 08:04.850
I'm-I'm a game show host.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.085
ALF, it's just for three days.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.155
That's enough time for
my sprit to be broken.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.458
ALF, don't you think you're
being a little overly dramatic?

08:13.460 --> 08:15.260
Overly dramatic?

08:15.262 --> 08:19.431
Overly dramatic?
Kate, there's no TV in here.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.766
We can let you
use the small TV.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.302
The black and white one
with the one inch screen?

08:24.304 --> 08:27.105
Good! I'll tape it to my eyes.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.608
Why don't you just
tell grandma about me?

08:29.610 --> 08:31.109
ALF, we can't.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.446
Well, fine.
The charade continues.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.616
Besides, I don't think you
and my mother would hit it off.

08:37.618 --> 08:41.152
Don't be silly.
I get along with everybody.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.954
I'm a people alien.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.725
Well, you've never come
across anyone like my mother.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.226
What is it with her?

08:48.228 --> 08:51.696
I mean, she walked into
the house and took over.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.498
I hate when people do that.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.801
Some people are not as
considerate as you are.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.371
Well, I think what we have here

08:59.373 --> 09:02.541
is your basic
parent-child dynamic.

09:02.543 --> 09:06.211
Every daughter feels the way
you do about her mom.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.214
Well, not every daughter.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.485
Oh! Oh, absolutely not.

09:13.487 --> 09:17.989
Look, all I'm saying is your mom
knows how to push your buttons.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.392
Now, I suggest you
confront her.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.028
ALF, I can't confront
my mother.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.997
- Why not?
- I don't know, uh..

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
I guess it goes back
to my childhood.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.835
You see, I was an only
child and I think that..

09:30.837 --> 09:33.672
I think that my mother
was over protective of me.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.708
In fact, I-I think that
she loved me too much.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.677
[ALF burps]

09:38.679 --> 09:40.178
Why am I telling you this?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.180
I don't know,
I'm barely listening.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.116
Lynn ate all my banana bread.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.352
Oh, I'm sorry, it was great.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.788
Mom, do you think I could get
the recipe from grandma?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.691
It wasn't that good.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.761
No. I don't even know
wh-why I said that.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.363
Oh, good save.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.469
Here, Brian,
why don't you put

10:04.471 --> 10:06.037
that right by
grandma's suitcases.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.706
Okay.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.873
Here you go.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.876
A nice, home cooked meal.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.545
Must be grandma's recipe.

10:13.547 --> 10:16.414
Just eat it.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.782
Mom, grandma's gonna be
gone in a half an hour.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.252
Right, right.
I got through three days.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.921
I can last another 30 minutes.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.924
- Where is grandma?
- She's cleaning the bathroom.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.727
I just cleaned
that bathroom yesterday.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.829
And you did a great job.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.664
That's not what
grandma said.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.699
It was spotless.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.870
Oh!

10:40.107 --> 10:41.640
[sighs]

10:41.642 --> 10:44.409
ALF, ALF, get back
into the garage

10:44.411 --> 10:46.177
my mother is still here.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.413
I've had it with the garage

10:48.415 --> 10:50.482
and I've had it
with your mother.

10:50.484 --> 10:55.587
This is my home.
This is where the bathroom is.

10:55.589 --> 10:58.657
ALF, grandma's in the bathroom.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.359
What does she have,
squatters rights?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.828
That does it. I'm gonna
have to file a grievance.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.764
[door opens]

11:05.766 --> 11:07.465
- Mom, ALF, she's coming.
- 'ALF.'

11:07.467 --> 11:08.933
- Go.
- The kitchen, go, go.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.535
I'm going, I'm going.

11:10.537 --> 11:14.105
Boy, somebody took
a grumpy pill.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.140
[telephone ringing]

11:15.142 --> 11:17.342
I'll get it.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.845
'Hello?'

11:20.847 --> 11:22.847
Who packed my suitcases?

11:22.849 --> 11:25.684
Uh, I did.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.353
I thought you might
wanna save time.

11:30.624 --> 11:35.026
Look at this. You put all
my underwear on the top.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.829
Kate, that is so tacky.

11:37.831 --> 11:41.466
Uh, grandma, it's for you.
It's crazy Estelle.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.402
I wonder what that
crackpot wants now.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.238
[sniffs]

11:47.240 --> 11:49.240
Too much oregano, honey.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.176
- 'Thanks, sweetheart.'
- You're welcome.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.378
What is it, Estelle?

11:55.716 --> 11:58.850
What do you mean
you're gonna be late?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.318
N.. Now you see that?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.487
You see that? You always
do that to me, Estelle.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.656
You know I hate
running for planes.

12:04.658 --> 12:05.890
'I'd..'

12:05.892 --> 12:08.426
Well, you are aggravating me.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.429
Oh, come on.
Everybody likes me..

12:13.567 --> 12:16.801
Fine! Just go to Hawaii
by yourself then.

12:18.672 --> 12:21.906
Yeah, I hope you fall
into a live volcano, Estelle.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.809
Good news?

12:26.680 --> 12:31.616
Late! She always has to be late.
It's like a-a sickness with her.

12:31.618 --> 12:35.053
You-you are still going
to Hawaii, aren't you?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.888
The woman is so selfish.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.423
I mean, that's all
she thinks about

12:38.425 --> 12:41.359
is herself, self, self, self.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.961
You wanna know why
she is always late?

12:42.963 --> 12:46.798
Because she spends two hours
putting on make up.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.601
[laughs]
As if anything could
help that face.

12:49.603 --> 12:53.471
You are still...going
to Hawaii, aren't you?

12:53.473 --> 12:57.075
She was actually late for
her own husband's funeral.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.811
And her makeup
was on crooked.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.981
As matter of fact,
so was his.

13:02.983 --> 13:07.819
But you are still going
to Hawaii, aren't you?

13:07.821 --> 13:08.953
One thing is certain

13:08.955 --> 13:12.557
I'm not going to Hawaii
with a crazy woman.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.225
I'm gonna stay right here.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.994
[ALF groans]

13:18.131 --> 13:19.898
Garbage disposal.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.834
[instrumental music]

13:24.971 --> 13:26.004
[instrumental music]

13:29.743 --> 13:32.177
You know, your mother
really is amazing

13:32.179 --> 13:34.078
you can see yourself
in those tiles.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.648
Who cares!

13:36.650 --> 13:38.750
Not me.

13:38.752 --> 13:40.585
I guess I was just talking
from the top of my head.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.920
I'm sorry.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.488
But it's driving
me crazy

13:43.490 --> 13:46.591
the way she is treating
me like a child.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.694
I don't know, maybe you should
do what ALF suggested.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.362
Maybe you should
confront her.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.765
(ALF)
'Right on.'

13:53.767 --> 13:55.600
ALF?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.969
[grunts]
Who else?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.437
What are you doing under there?

13:59.439 --> 14:03.508
Trying to keep warm.
The garage is freezing!

14:03.510 --> 14:05.143
Listen, I couldn't
help overhearing

14:05.145 --> 14:06.978
the grandma discussion.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.113
How long have you
been under there?

14:09.115 --> 14:10.348
Just the last few nights.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.850
Anyway, about grandma..

14:11.852 --> 14:14.652
Were you under there
on Sunday night?

14:14.654 --> 14:17.822
Don't worry,
slept like a baby.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.191
Didn't hear a thing.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.461
Now, what are we gonna
do about grandma?

14:23.463 --> 14:26.731
I don't know, ALF, uh, I don't
know what we can do about her.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.334
Well, I can't sleep under
here every night.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.903
You got that right.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.906
And I'm not living in
the garage any longer.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.175
Unless you decide
to put in a hot tub

14:37.177 --> 14:38.309
and a big screen TV.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.411
- Forget it.
- Okay.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.048
Then grandma has to go.
Here's my plan.

14:44.050 --> 14:48.386
You tell her that the house
is built on a fault line.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.989
Then some morning you
wake her up and scream.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.690
Earthquake! Earthquake!

14:52.692 --> 14:54.993
And you guys walk around
the house going

14:54.995 --> 14:56.895
whoa, whoa!

14:58.665 --> 15:01.432
I don't know, hmm..

15:01.434 --> 15:02.934
How does that go again?

15:02.936 --> 15:05.436
- Whoa, whoa..
- More arm motion.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.906
'There you go. Yeah!'

15:07.908 --> 15:10.842
Wait a minute. So what if
we do tell her about ALF?

15:10.844 --> 15:15.013
How could we tell her,
Kate, what would we say?

15:15.015 --> 15:18.850
Uh, I guess we just
have to sit her down

15:18.852 --> 15:21.920
we'd have to ask her
if she's ever seen "E.T."

15:21.922 --> 15:24.956
Why do you keep
comparing me to E.T.?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.791
I'm nothing like E.T.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.027
You know, someday, Willie,
someone from Melmac

15:29.029 --> 15:31.429
is going to ask me
what you're like.

15:31.431 --> 15:36.467
And I'm gonna say, well did you
ever see "The Nutty Professor?"

15:36.469 --> 15:39.237
Oh, for crying out loud.

15:39.239 --> 15:43.775
The best way to tell grandma
about me is to do it quickly.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.710
I'll go wait in
the kitchen for her.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.745
She usually has
a snack around now.

15:47.747 --> 15:51.282
No, ALF, you will not talk to
her. You will do this our way.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.585
Okay. Don't get your
nightie in a knot.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.522
It's your house.
I respect that.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.857
Goodnight.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.436
(ALF)
'Hey, go for it, Willie!'

16:11.438 --> 16:13.972
Alright,
alright. I'm leaving.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.177
[ALF humming]

16:23.083 --> 16:25.817
Well, this ought to be good.
Here she comes.

16:25.819 --> 16:26.985
[humming]

16:29.522 --> 16:31.255
Hi, grandma!

16:31.257 --> 16:33.424
Oh, my God!

16:33.426 --> 16:35.593
Have a seat.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.328
Who are you?
What are you?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.830
A little background.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.633
My name is ALF. I come
from the planet Melmac.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.602
I'm a member of a civilization

16:44.604 --> 16:46.871
millions of years
ahead of your own.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.773
And now I live
in a laundry basket

16:48.775 --> 16:51.376
next to the washing machine.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.077
Cup of java?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.713
I know.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.649
I know you're
something Willie made.

16:58.651 --> 17:02.520
He's always making
crazy things in the garage.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.957
Take my word for it,
I'm a space being.

17:05.959 --> 17:09.794
And since you've been here,
I've had to live in the garage.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.629
Let me ask you something.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.465
Why are you so hard
to get along with?

17:14.467 --> 17:18.469
Kate's easy going.
Is she adopted or something?

17:18.471 --> 17:21.372
Anyway, my advice
to you would be

17:21.374 --> 17:25.176
lighten up on her, be nice.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.245
Oh, yeah, another thing.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.548
Stop poking me!

17:31.484 --> 17:33.317
We'll talk again.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.554
When you are a little
less touchy feeling.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.058
Ya-ya-ya!

17:49.202 --> 17:51.335
Okay, I'll make the break..

17:51.337 --> 17:52.837
Good morning, grandma.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.506
Oh, my God!
It wasn't a nightmare.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.676
Sit down. Take a load off.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.279
You mean,
you-you actually do..

18:01.281 --> 18:02.947
...live in this house?

18:02.949 --> 18:06.017
I thought we
covered that last night.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.653
I just can't bring
myself to..

18:11.391 --> 18:13.024
I guess you
two have met.

18:13.026 --> 18:16.194
It introduced
itself last night.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.963
Listen, I know you
wanted to introduce me

18:18.965 --> 18:23.134
but, uh, I couldn't stand
being in the garage any longer!

18:23.136 --> 18:27.171
There was a spider
in there, th-this big.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.642
Well, now you know, mom.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.945
We live with an alien
from outer space.

18:33.947 --> 18:38.449
Kate, I had such
high hopes for you.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.886
I sense some
negative vibes here.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.255
Why don't we just
discuss this over breakfast?

18:44.257 --> 18:45.923
Good idea!

18:45.925 --> 18:47.725
Good morning.
Good morning, grandma.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.994
Good morning, ALF.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.396
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh is right.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.732
You met ALF!
Isn't he great?

18:54.734 --> 18:58.402
Is he going to eat
at the table with us?

18:58.404 --> 19:00.304
ALF always
eats with us.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.907
What does he eat, kibble?

19:02.909 --> 19:06.177
I resent that. I don't
even know what kibble is

19:06.179 --> 19:07.445
but I resent that.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.580
Huh! This is wonderful.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.749
He sits at
the head of the table.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.918
Well, Dorothy, he's
comfortable there.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.288
I-I don't really think it
makes all that big a difference.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.992
Well, I only figured that
the head of the household

19:20.994 --> 19:23.928
should sit at the head
of the table. That's it.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.764
It doesn't matter
where anyone sits

19:26.766 --> 19:29.300
and we all know who
the head of this household is.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.169
- Juice?
- Yeah.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.938
Oh, how about some of
those Belgian waffles

19:33.940 --> 19:35.940
with the sugar
sprinkled on them?

19:35.942 --> 19:38.676
- You know how I like them.
- We're having pancakes, okay?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.611
Fine. If that's
all we've got.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.513
He sits at
the head of the table

19:42.515 --> 19:45.116
he decides what you're
gonna have for breakfast.

19:45.118 --> 19:48.819
This little mop from
the moon is running your house.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.355
Mop from the..
Mop from the moon?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.791
How could you
be so ignorant?

19:53.793 --> 19:57.662
There are no mops
on the moon. Ha!

19:57.664 --> 20:00.565
I didn't mean
that literally.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.401
I meant that
as an insult!

20:03.403 --> 20:04.969
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.705
Well, if I had
a straw and a napkin

20:07.707 --> 20:10.641
I would fill you
so full of spitballs..

20:10.643 --> 20:12.810
Do you hear how he's
talking to me?

20:12.812 --> 20:15.479
Listen, either
she goes, or I go.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.148
Which is it, Kate?

20:18.851 --> 20:22.153
Well, do you actually
have to think about this?

20:22.155 --> 20:24.322
No. Yes!

20:24.324 --> 20:26.591
Wait a minute, wait, wait.

20:26.593 --> 20:30.361
Nobody is leaving
and nobody is staying.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.029
Good strong stand, Willie.

20:32.031 --> 20:36.267
No wonder you don't sit
at the head of the table.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.936
Well, I never thought
my own daughter

20:38.938 --> 20:40.338
would wanna
throw me out of her house.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.074
Grandma, no one's
throwing you out.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.576
You have wanted me to
leave ever since I got here.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.278
- You got that right.
- 'ALF!'

20:47.280 --> 20:48.412
Well, it's true.

20:48.414 --> 20:52.283
Would you just stay
out of this, please?

20:52.285 --> 20:53.618
Is that true, Kate?

20:53.620 --> 20:54.852
Tell her.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.787
[sighs]

20:56.789 --> 20:59.690
Yes. Yes, it is true.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.426
Kate, a little
less direct.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.629
Mom, you drive me crazy.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.530
You come into
my house, you take over

21:06.532 --> 21:09.800
you make me feel like
I can't do anything right.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.402
Well, I..

21:11.404 --> 21:13.704
I...don't do that.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.539
- Yes, you do.
- ALF!

21:15.541 --> 21:16.807
What?

21:16.809 --> 21:19.410
You have turned
my daughter against me!

21:19.412 --> 21:23.414
You have used some cosmic
powers to take over her brain!

21:23.416 --> 21:25.883
Grandma, no one's
been brainwashed.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.753
Mom has felt like
this for a long time.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.788
She was just
afraid to tell you.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.456
You know, this is your fault!

21:32.458 --> 21:35.126
You are responsible
for this whole thing!

21:35.128 --> 21:38.396
I make things happen,
I'm a catalyst.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.399
- Listen to me, mom.
- Tsk.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.302
Listen. I love you.

21:44.304 --> 21:47.338
But this is our house..

21:47.340 --> 21:49.307
...and as long as you
wanna be in this house

21:49.309 --> 21:51.842
you're going to have
to follow some rules.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.613
What, what
kind of rules?

21:55.615 --> 21:59.116
Uh, no going
for rides in the dryer.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.919
No chewing on any
part of Lucky's body.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.322
ALF, those rules
only apply to you.

22:04.324 --> 22:08.492
Not fair. Why does
she get to chew on Lucky?

22:08.494 --> 22:11.295
She doesn't. She doesn't.

22:11.297 --> 22:15.433
Uh, the rule was, no going
for rides in any appliance.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.203
Well, look,
you know, I don't know

22:19.205 --> 22:21.505
if I can memorize
the whole bunch of rules.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.175
There's only one rule
that's really important.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.944
Treat your daughter
like an adult.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.213
You did a wonderful
job of raising me

22:29.215 --> 22:32.650
why don't you trust
me to do the same?

22:32.652 --> 22:35.619
Oh, Katie, I do trust you.

22:35.621 --> 22:38.689
I don't. I-I will. I want to.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.125
I-I love you.. I'm sorry.

22:41.127 --> 22:44.128
I.. Just tell me. Tell me
what you want me to do.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.732
- Oh.
- Just mellow out, granny.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.467
Come on.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.035
Let's have breakfast, huh?

22:51.037 --> 22:54.505
Great.
I'll make breakfast.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.006
Mom..

22:56.008 --> 22:57.575
...I'll make breakfast.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.711
Oh, honey, every time you make
pancakes, they come out watery.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.514
What? Mom..

23:03.516 --> 23:08.552
Yes. Okay. Right.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.221
I'll just go sit down..

23:12.392 --> 23:14.592
...way over here.

Here you are,
Brian, try this on.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.071
Oh, no, not another gift!

23:27.073 --> 23:29.206
What are you trying
to do, buy the kid off?

23:29.208 --> 23:33.077
- It's too big, grandma.
- You'll grow into it.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.347
Until then, Willie could
use it as a car cover.

23:36.349 --> 23:38.449
Ha ha!

23:38.451 --> 23:41.552
Oh, sure.
Go ahead, make jokes

23:41.554 --> 23:44.121
and after I made you a gift.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.991
A gift for me?
Let me see. Let me see.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.361
What is it?

23:50.363 --> 23:52.563
A muzzle!

23:52.565 --> 23:55.032
Ha ha!
