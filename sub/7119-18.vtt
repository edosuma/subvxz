Aw, man.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.599
Everyone wants to eat me up.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.601
lt's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.272
Now, for little-kid soup.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.108
The secret is a low flame

08:46.192 --> 08:48.944
over a long period.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.571
That's Jake's secret, too.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.197
Sure hope he saves me.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.408
l will save thee, Finn.

- Jake!
- Finn!

What are you doing here?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.293
Heh, heh, l was looking
for you, knucklehead.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.211
l was so worried that, right after lunch,

09:06.296 --> 09:08.172
l plunged into the dungeon after you.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.757
Strangest thing, though.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.008
l kept running into obstacles.

Choose your dueling weapon!

The challenges were impossible for me.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.857
But you would have blown right through them.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.861
l kept asking myself,
"what would Finn do?"

09:30.945 --> 09:33.530
Just...frustrating.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.823
You know what l mean.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.201
Yeah, l think l do.

Now let's figure out a way out of this cage!

09:45.460 --> 09:46.627
Got it covered...

09:46.711 --> 09:48.087
with key hand!

09:48.171 --> 09:50.339
l don't see any keyholes in this cage, though.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.840
Not a problem, man.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.841
Lock hand!

09:52.926 --> 09:54.051
l'll get us out...

Come on, man.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.729
We still got a couple minutes left

10:05.814 --> 10:07.815
to steal that crystal eye
and win your bet!

10:07.899 --> 10:08.690
Wait.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.942
You'd help me win a bet that l made

10:10.026 --> 10:12.277
about how I could accomplish something
without you?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.571
Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!

Uh, we learned that two heads
are better than one head?
