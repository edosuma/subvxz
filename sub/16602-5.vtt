00:18.819 --> 00:22.356
- I think it's done.
 - Well, let's hear it.

00:22.423 --> 00:25.826
I think we should read
 each other's lines.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.328
That means that you start.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.331
[chuckles]
 Okay.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.466
"No matter what is going on,

00:32.533 --> 00:35.736
I am hungry and thinking
about you."

00:38.572 --> 00:41.475
"There's a scoop of light
 just above my knee.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.611
It resembles the world."

00:46.046 --> 00:50.017
"Pictures of food
 in restaurants always
 depress me.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.052
"Not because it feels tacky

00:52.120 --> 00:55.489
but because it feels
 unnecessary."

00:55.556 --> 00:57.125
[clears throat]

00:59.227 --> 01:02.563
"My mind returns
again and again

01:02.630 --> 01:04.697
to the picture you gave me."

01:08.169 --> 01:10.771
- [keys jingle]
- [latch clicks]

01:43.837 --> 01:45.105
Ali:
 "I'm helpless.

01:45.173 --> 01:49.677
"Rushing back to fix the 'H.'

01:49.743 --> 01:51.179
How can I help you?"

01:53.914 --> 01:55.316
Leslie:
 "I used to meditate

01:55.383 --> 01:58.519
"on the idea
 of not having to fix

01:58.586 --> 01:59.753
anything at all."

02:04.425 --> 02:08.596
Ali:
 "This color is connected
 to that color."

02:11.899 --> 02:13.534
"The waves break."

* [theme]

03:14.161 --> 03:15.529
[door closes]

03:15.596 --> 03:17.931
- Maura: Joshy?
 - Josh: Down here.

03:22.836 --> 03:26.940
- Hey. What's going on?
- Rita's dead.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.544
What ha-- What happened?

03:30.611 --> 03:34.782
She went to the mall
yesterday, and she,
uh, tripped.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.918
She was at the top
of the escalators
on the fourth floor,

03:37.985 --> 03:40.621
and, uh, she fell.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.424
- Have you told anyone?
- Mmm-mm.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.894
I'm honored
that you told me first.

03:49.630 --> 03:53.667
It's not an honor.
It's just information
that you need to have.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.371
Oh, my God.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.140
[sighs]

04:00.207 --> 04:03.311
What are you gonna do?
 Is there gonna be a memorial
 service or something?

04:03.377 --> 04:05.346
She didn't have people,

04:05.413 --> 04:08.282
so her sister is gonna take
 her ashes back to Fresno.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.051
She also wants me to transport

04:11.118 --> 04:15.255
some of those ashes to Colton.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.189
Do you think
 that's a good idea?

04:16.255 --> 04:17.825
I mean, are you gonna do that?

04:17.891 --> 04:20.894
- He's a Christian.
 - Mm-hmm.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.897
And it might have
 been suicide,

04:23.964 --> 04:26.233
so I don't know.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.901
You-- You didn't say suicide.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.236
You said that she--
 she tripped

04:29.303 --> 04:30.304
or she-- she fell.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.305
You didn't say.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.543
I don't know.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.244
[sighs]

04:37.311 --> 04:38.579
God.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.781
Okay.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.261
Did you know we were
having sex back then?

04:54.328 --> 04:56.697
I'm sorry. What?

05:00.368 --> 05:03.871
Did you know
that Rita and I...

05:03.937 --> 05:05.305
were having sex back then?

05:06.640 --> 05:10.511
[exhales]
 No, I didn't.

05:10.578 --> 05:14.382
[sighs]
 Until the pregnancy,

05:14.448 --> 05:18.419
I guess, uh,
your mom and I thought

05:18.486 --> 05:20.954
we were paying her
to be your best friend.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.725
[sighs]

05:26.494 --> 05:28.061
That's fucked up.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.432
It's true.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.803
[exhales]

05:42.476 --> 05:44.478
Len:
 Are you sure that's
 how you inflate 'em?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.447
No, I-- I don't know.
 I think--

05:46.514 --> 05:47.681
That's what it said.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.150
I don't know
 what I'm gonna do.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.253
I can't even get one,
 and I have, like, 500.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.288
All right. What do you do?
 You just grab 'em?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.691
You're trying to get air,
 and then you seal it up.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.592
This is very
 opening ceremonies

05:58.659 --> 06:00.260
of the Olympics.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.430
You know what,
it probably doesn't matter.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.031
- 'cause no one's
 gonna come anyway.
 - Why don't we just--

06:04.097 --> 06:06.600
You know,
 all these people RSVP'd

06:06.667 --> 06:09.202
but, like, it's on Facebook,

06:09.269 --> 06:10.103
so you totally
 cannot trust it,

06:10.170 --> 06:11.304
you know what I mean?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.273
'Cause they just go, like,
 "Yeah."

06:13.340 --> 06:15.809
You know?
 And then they don't mean it.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.978
I mean, why--
 They should have
 a category that's like--

06:18.045 --> 06:20.648
"Yeah, yeah, I'm saying yes,
 but I really am probably
 not coming."

06:20.714 --> 06:22.950
- Yeah, like--
 - No idea. I have no idea.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.653
- Like, I'm coming,
 but I may not come?
 - Right.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.521
Oh, don't let me forget
 to pack up the lighters

06:27.588 --> 06:29.022
from the barbecue,
 the big ones,

06:29.089 --> 06:30.123
'cause, like,
 I have all these votives.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.894
Like, a thousand votives.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.765
You're so adorable.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.132
Am I?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.768
It's kind of working.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.437
Do you remember the week
 before Zachy was born?

06:43.504 --> 06:47.575
How worried you were?
 And you wanted, like,
 everything to be perfect?

06:47.641 --> 06:50.678
You were planning everything.

06:50.744 --> 06:56.349
You were like a cute,
 little prenatal Mussolini.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.451
[chuckles]

07:00.954 --> 07:04.091
If no one comes to your thing,
 I'll come to your thing.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.561
Put me down as

07:07.628 --> 07:12.165
your one official RSVP.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.168
I'll be there.

07:17.404 --> 07:20.173
I thought you had
 a thing with Una.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.143
I do have a thing with Una,

07:23.210 --> 07:26.914
but I can "resched."

07:36.356 --> 07:39.493
- Josh: What are we gonna do
 with this house?
 - Maura: I have no idea.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.129
Tammy really put an effort
 into fucking this place up.

07:45.833 --> 07:49.336
I don't even recall
 what used to be here.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.171
The pony wall?

07:51.238 --> 07:54.975
You know, the big, beautiful,
 irreplaceable shelf

07:55.042 --> 07:57.077
where we kept the records
 and the books and stuff?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.912
Oh.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.914
Now it looks like
 a California Pizza Kitchen.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.522
I'm sorry I was such
 a shitty parent.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.009
One second.

08:32.780 --> 08:33.881
What are you looking for?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.587
- Hold that, please.
 - Why?

08:49.997 --> 08:52.633
Okay. I think we
 should call somebody.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.738
Demo's a thing.
 Jewish men don't do demo.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.473
I am a Jewish woman, Joshy.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.977
And Jewish women do whatever
 the fuck they want.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.280
Oh, no.
 Here, put this on.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.051
- There you go.
- Seriously?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.553
[sighs]

09:17.691 --> 09:19.593
Okay.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.063
Whoa.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.814
Fuck, yeah.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.385
Can you put
 those in the center

09:45.452 --> 09:46.720
of that one right there?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.455
Can you make space?

09:48.521 --> 09:51.859
'Cause I feel like we have
 enough flowers over there.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.727
- Hey, Sarah.
 - Oh, God.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.264
- Hi. Wow.
 - [chuckles]

09:57.330 --> 10:01.101
- Oh, so where are the--
- It's getting there.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.103
Sarah: Oh, I decided
 to go with papusas.

10:03.170 --> 10:07.274
[stammers]
 The event's called
 Tacos con Torah.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.143
- Right? Tacos.
 - Yeah, I got it.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.445
- You had suggested that--
 - Yeah, I understand.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.214
I really don't think
 it's that big of a deal.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.717
- Okay.
- This is-- The taco guy
was too expensive.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.019
This is a woman-owned
 business,

10:19.086 --> 10:20.153
so I think that
 that's fantastic.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.122
You know, I don't know.
We can call it

10:22.189 --> 10:25.292
- Papusas con Psalms
 or something.
 - Great.

10:25.358 --> 10:29.730

10:47.347 --> 10:49.750
Sultry, sultry.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.153
Did you notice that there's
 a huge hole out there?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.621
I'm gonna put a sign there
 in case somebody--

10:54.688 --> 10:56.056
I don't want anyone breaking
 their ankle on the way--

10:56.123 --> 10:57.825
Gonna put a sign on this hole?

10:57.891 --> 11:01.695
- Stop it.
 - [laughs]

11:01.762 --> 11:03.330
Oh, my gosh, look at you guys.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.866
You guys are already on it.
 Thank you!

11:05.933 --> 11:08.268
- Z'hirut hor.
 - What does that mean?

11:08.335 --> 11:12.139
That means "Caution: Hole."
 It's in Hebrew.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.107
Do you think maybe we should
 write the translation

11:14.174 --> 11:16.043
in case everybody
 doesn't understand that?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.611
- Sure.
 - You're such
 a smart little cookie.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.914
[chuckles]
 Look. People.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.350
- Hi. Welcome.
 - Hi.

11:23.416 --> 11:27.020
Shabbat shalom.
 We are asking people
 to unplug from technology.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.890
- Okay.
- Just drop your device.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.358
Thank you.
 Shabbat shalom.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.960
- Mm-hmm.
- Shabat shalom.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.461
Thanks.
 We'll take good care of 'em.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.930
- Enjoy yourself.
 - Thanks.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.298
Hey, would you like
 to unplug, sir?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.833
- You can't have my phone.
 - Okay.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.468
Have a good evening.

Thank you. Where's Pops?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.389
- Hi, Grandma. How are you?
 - Hi. How are you?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.157
- You look so lovely.
 - Thank you.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.558
Isn't this cool?
 Look at all this.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.894
So wonderful.
 Where's Sarah?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.996
Excuse me.
 You must be Sarah's parents.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.798
- I am. How are you?
 - I'm Duvid, the new cantor.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.699
Hello, Duvid.
 How are you?

12:12.766 --> 12:14.467
- It is so nice to meet you.
 - Pleasure to meet you.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.236
All are welcome here, okay?

12:16.303 --> 12:17.604
- Okay.
 - Thank you.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.406
You're welcome.
Come on.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.241
- Should we eat?
- Yeah.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.676
- Hey, what's up, man? Len.
 - Hey, I know who you are.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.812
I've heard a lot about you.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.213
- All right.
 - Come here.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.680
Jeez.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.116
Shelly: Sarah!

12:29.182 --> 12:31.251
- Oh, hey, Mom.
 - This is so gorgeous.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.186
- This is unbel--
 And you look gorgeous, too.
 - Thank you.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.622
Listen, I just wanted to tell
 you that Buzzy didn't come,

12:35.688 --> 12:38.591
because he felt that things
 were still a
 little complicated.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.861
But I'm here representing
 both of us.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.763
- And don't worry,
 I'll be fine.
 - Okay.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.965
Come here.
 Let me take a picture.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.766
Can you not?
 Can you put that away?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.802
'Cause we're trying
 to unplug and just like--

12:48.869 --> 12:51.271
- No posting tonight.
 - Oh, all right.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.874
But, you know,
 I have 126 followers.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.909
You would be guaranteed
 some likes.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.645
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.381
-If you say.
 -Is the parking
 lot filling up?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.783
I don't know.
 I took an app here.
 Where are the tacos?

13:03.851 --> 13:04.717
- It's not tacos,
 it's papusas.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.219
- What's a papusa?

13:06.286 --> 13:09.389
Raquel, I think maybe
 we should get started.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.191
I mean, there's so many people
 here, and what if they leave?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.725
No, no, no, everybody seems
 really happy.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.961
Let's give it a second
 to marinate.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.562
- Are you sure? Okay.
 - Oh, my gosh.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.997
- No, that's good.
 - That's good.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.067
- How long? How long?
- Let's say 16 minutes.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.368
- 16.
- Is that okay?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.303
Got it. 16.
 I can do 16.

13:24.671 --> 13:28.575
- Oh, Sarah.
 - Oh, my God.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.078
- I thought that he would--
 - I don't--

13:31.144 --> 13:34.114
- Fuck. Okay. I'll just--
 - Yeah.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.549
- Why don't you--
 - And I'll--

13:36.616 --> 13:38.952
- Mama.
- Yeah.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.421
Hi. Oh, God, you look nice.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.523
- Thank you.
 - Why is Josh here?

13:43.590 --> 13:46.226
I mean, that's kind of awkward
 with Raquel and everything.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.962
- Rita's dead.
 - Oh, my God.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.697
And you brought him here?

13:50.763 --> 13:53.800
Well, yes. I thought
 he could use the community.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.869
And I encouraged him to come.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.938
And these tacos are delicious.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.540
I'm sorry, but really?
 Tonight of all nights?

14:00.607 --> 14:03.510
I mean, Raquel's already
starting to freak out.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.147
Okay, yeah, I know.
 Well, what happened?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.916
Josh will tell you.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.357
Hey.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.492
- Hey.
 - I heard.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.062
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.731
Are you okay?
Can I get you anything?

14:24.797 --> 14:26.366
- Like what?
- I don't know.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.236
We have an espresso machine.
 You want an espresso?

14:29.302 --> 14:30.703
No, I'm good.
 Thank you.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.940
- Hi.
 - It's pretty in here.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.475
- Rita is dead.
- [gasps] What?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.510
- What?
- Yeah.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.948
Oh, my God. Fuck.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.950
What happened?

14:43.016 --> 14:45.552
- She fell off the mall.
- Who fell off the mall?

14:45.618 --> 14:48.421
- We don't have
 all the details yet.
 - I gotta circulate.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.623
- What happened?
- There was an accident.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.226
- Rita's dead.
 - What?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.695
What does it mean,
 she fell off the mall?

14:55.762 --> 14:58.231
Josh: She was, uh,
 at the top of the escalators.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.968
You know? It was, like,
the fourth floor.
She fell.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.937
- She might have jumped.
- Oh, my baby.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.239
She was on anti-depressants.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.907
And she said she swapped.
 I don't know.

15:07.975 --> 15:11.244
See that's what happens.
 If you change the medication,

15:11.311 --> 15:13.080
it becomes more of a problem,
 and sometimes people
 commit suicide.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.114
- We don't know
 if it was suicide.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.348
- But you said
 she jumped off--

15:15.415 --> 15:17.584
- It doesn't matter.
- She might have fallen.
We don't know.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.786
- Maura: Leave him alone.
- Shelly: I'm sorry,
I was just processing.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.355
- Maura: Then let him process.
 - Shelly: Okay, okay.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.529
Hey.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.102
-I'm gonna
 get a cup of coffee.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.071
-Okay.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.543
Rita died.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.053
Do you wanna go for a walk?

15:53.820 --> 15:54.687
Okay.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.901
The fucked up part is

16:08.968 --> 16:12.605
I was the last person
 that she talked to probably.

16:12.672 --> 16:16.343
I was at her house
 just before.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.846
She was good.
 She gave me this tape of songs

16:19.912 --> 16:21.814
that I recorded for her
in high school.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.083
Like, the tape?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.452
And she was in a great mood.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.121
You could not have known
 any of this.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.391
- This is not--
- I was the last person
to see her.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.026
That's all I'm gonna say.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.564
Well, that fuckin' sucks.
 That's not fair

16:37.630 --> 16:40.067
to put that on you
 after everything else.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.171
Oh, my God, poor Josh.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.440
So she was close
 to the whole family?

16:47.507 --> 16:50.043
No, I mean, she's basically
a part of the family.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.678
It's so complicated.

16:51.744 --> 16:55.482
- Can I interest anyone
in a cappuccino?
- Ohh.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.386
"Sinai Coffee."

16:59.452 --> 17:02.989
I can't drink that,
'cause it disagrees
with my politics.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.459
- They're Israeli beans.
- Oh, okay.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.560
You know what? There's so much
 more yummy stuff down there.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.262
- Just help yourselves.
- Yeah, thanks.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.199
Great. Thanks. You know,
 I'll take a--

17:12.265 --> 17:13.500
I'll take a horchata.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.502
- Me, too.
 - Okay. Sure.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.003
And could I get
 a couple of those tacos?

17:18.070 --> 17:21.040
- A papusa. No taco.
 - Oh.

17:21.108 --> 17:24.877
Excuse me.
 Just to be clear,

17:24.944 --> 17:27.814
you're not having the espresso
 because it supports the state
 of Israel.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.316
That's right.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.884
I don't want blood
 on my hands.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.586
What about the blood
 of Jewish children?

17:33.653 --> 17:35.655
Thank you.
 Excuse me?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.524
Someone died in my cousin's
 platoon. He was 18 years old.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.360
Can I have one too, please?
Please don't do this.

17:40.427 --> 17:44.097
It's a tragedy that any nation
 should send its young

17:44.164 --> 17:45.798
to die for an unjust cause.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.334
- An unjust cause?
 - Yeah.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.202
He was protecting
 our homeland.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.803
What about the homeland
of the Palestinians?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.605
Yeah. Thank you.
 Okay, please--

17:52.672 --> 17:55.108
Can you stretch your mind
 just a little bit there?

17:55.175 --> 17:56.976
Do you think the state of
 Israel has a right to exist?

17:57.043 --> 17:59.246
I think that that is
 an absurd question.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.813
It already exists.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.449
Jews have been slaughtered
 for centuries.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.217
Yeah, and they've done
 a little slaughtering.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.018
You ever read about
Sabra and Shatila?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.520
Oh, yeah.
That was in retaliation

18:07.587 --> 18:09.456
for the assassination
of Bachir Gemayel.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.858
Yeah, after Sharon had bombed
 the shit out of Beirut.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.026
Oh, come on,
 that's such a tired argument.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.663
- Rosh Hashanah, 1982.
 - Read the Balfour Declaration
 on your own time.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.232
- Take your time with it.
 - Oh, don't get me--

18:19.299 --> 18:22.369
- Are you even Jewish?
 - What has that got
 to do with anything?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.571
I should have guessed.
 That is perfect. Miss--

18:24.637 --> 18:27.106
- Oh, don't Miss me, sir.
 - Okay, okay.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.242
Your anti-Zionism sounds

18:29.309 --> 18:30.543
a whole lot
 like anti-Semitism.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.179
You see? That is a smear.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.247
And that prevents people
like you

18:34.314 --> 18:35.648
from being able to have
 a rational conversation.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.185
- It's the truth!
- You're yelling.
You're screaming.

18:38.251 --> 18:42.189
Fuck! These people
 are so unreasonable,
 and you are mad at me?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.824
Yes, I'm mad at you.
 This is my sister's event.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.194
We just had a death in the
 family, and you're arguing
 with people about Israel?

18:47.260 --> 18:49.128
- Strangers?
 - Oh, come on.

18:49.196 --> 18:52.165
- Are you an idiot?
 - Yes, Ali, I'm an idiot.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.167
- Can I just give you
a hug right now?
- Yes.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.902
'Cause I feel like--

18:55.968 --> 18:58.238
Okay. I'm so sorry, Josh.
 I'm so sorry.

19:12.719 --> 19:16.088
[sighs]
 I could just live
 right here in this hug.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.490
[sniffles]

19:17.557 --> 19:19.759
Sell everything
 and just move in.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.771
Hold on. Wait. Um--

19:31.838 --> 19:33.840
I might go on
 a road trip tonight.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.242
I have to.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.777
Gonna deliver some
of her ashes to Colton.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.313
Wow, that's tonight?

19:40.380 --> 19:43.182
Do you wanna go?
You wanna come with me?

19:48.688 --> 19:53.293
- Oh, Josh. Wow. It's--
 - We're gonna get started!

19:53.360 --> 19:56.829
- Okay, just think about it.
 - It's just-- Are you okay?

20:02.269 --> 20:04.871
* [singing]

20:14.146 --> 20:15.315
Hi.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.385
Hi.

20:22.188 --> 20:25.725
Get closer!
 Get closer!
 Everybody!

20:37.637 --> 20:41.608
Mmm. This is to remember
the sweetness of Shabbat

20:41.674 --> 20:43.310
for the rest of our week.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.344
I'm gonna pass that around.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.046
Welcome. Shabbat shalom.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.215
All: Shabbat shalom.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.683
How beautiful is this?

20:50.750 --> 20:54.654
Oh, what a beautiful,
 beautiful group.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.357
I want to invite each of you,
 when I walk around,

20:57.424 --> 20:59.459
to just take a second
 and look at the reflection

20:59.526 --> 21:01.361
of the candle on your nails.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.463
It's the reflection
 and the shadow.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.335
The rabbis tell us

21:08.401 --> 21:11.971
that there are 36 people

21:12.038 --> 21:14.841
whose righteousness
 sustains the world

21:14.907 --> 21:17.043
called the lamedvavniks.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.211
So if you know your Torah,

21:19.278 --> 21:22.615
we know that God destroyed
 the world once, right?

21:22.682 --> 21:25.885
Noah and the Ark? Remember?

21:25.952 --> 21:30.323
So these 36 people are like
 an insurance policy

21:30.390 --> 21:32.792
against that ever
happening again, right?

21:32.859 --> 21:35.828
So who are these 36 people?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.699
I want you guys to put
 your hand on the shoulder

21:39.766 --> 21:42.735
of the person next to you
 and get really close,

21:42.802 --> 21:45.738
so all of us can be linked
 in this circle, right?

21:45.805 --> 21:48.975
Is everybody close? Okay?

21:49.041 --> 21:50.510
Who are these 36?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.146
We don't know.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.416
Even the 36 don't know.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.385
So what is the lesson?

22:01.954 --> 22:05.525
The lesson is
 to treat each other...

22:08.361 --> 22:09.829
...as if we might be one.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.932
Or who knows?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.502
You might be standing
 next to one now.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.238
If it's anyone,
 it's you, Sarah.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.574
- This is magical.
 - Okay, it's Saturday night.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.576
It's the end of Shabbat.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.245
We're about to leave
the world of the holy

22:26.312 --> 22:28.381
and enter the
 rest of our week.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.949
Before we extinguish
 the candle,

22:30.016 --> 22:33.285
while there's still
a few glimmers of holiness

22:33.352 --> 22:35.154
left in our day,

22:35.221 --> 22:37.189
I'd like to invite anybody
 that has a blessing

22:37.256 --> 22:40.059
to come up and share it
with us.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.961
I'll go.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.665
The monarch butterflies
are here,

22:45.732 --> 22:50.202
marking the midpoint
in their epic migration

22:50.269 --> 22:53.940
from Canada
 to the jungles of Mexico.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.610
I'm just thinking about
 the pandemic of homelessness.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.679
Inner-city and...

22:59.746 --> 23:02.081
Guys, I'm seven months sober.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.851
I'm Len, and, um,
 don't kick me out,

23:04.917 --> 23:07.353
- but I'm not Jewish.
 - [chuckling]

23:07.420 --> 23:10.723
I am Jew-curious,
 if that's a term.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.759
I'm just happy to be here.

23:12.825 --> 23:16.663
This is a really, you know,
 special, uh, feeling.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.064
And it's, uh-- it's nice.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.000
It's very welcoming
 and warm and--

23:21.067 --> 23:24.336
And you guys are really lucky.
 Thank you for having me.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.438
Thank you.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.810
Anybody else?

23:32.579 --> 23:33.746
All right, I'll go.

23:33.813 --> 23:37.249
- Do you mind?
 - Sure.

23:37.316 --> 23:42.321
Um, my-- my son lost
 his best friend this week.

23:42.388 --> 23:46.225
And, uh, some of us
 just heard about it today,

23:46.292 --> 23:48.327
and we're in a bit of a shock.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.497
And her name was,
 uh, Rita Holt.

23:50.563 --> 23:54.033
And, uh, Rabbi, this is not
 the traditional way to go
 at Havdalah,

23:54.100 --> 23:57.570
but if you don't mind,
I would like to offer
a kaddish for her.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.906
Oh, this isn't really
 the time to--

23:59.972 --> 24:01.574
Yisgadal, v'yiskaddash
 sh'mey rabbah...

24:01.641 --> 24:04.043
[continues kaddish]

25:26.025 --> 25:28.761
I did not expect
to be so moved.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.397
By the service
 or the propaganda?

25:31.463 --> 25:32.832
You're still pissed off
at the Zionists?

25:32.899 --> 25:34.634
It's stuck in my craw.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.636
I mean, you can light
 a bunch of votive candles

25:36.703 --> 25:38.537
in a shitty gym, but--

25:38.605 --> 25:40.973
- [cries out]
 - Oh, my God!

25:41.040 --> 25:42.742
Oh, my God!
 Are you okay?

25:42.809 --> 25:45.678
Who put the fuckin' hole here?

25:45.745 --> 25:48.547
- Get me out of here.
 - Okay. Here.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.049
[grunting]

25:50.116 --> 25:53.753
- That was marvelous.
 - Thanks, Mom.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.588
The next time we do this,
 we should do a showcase

25:55.655 --> 25:57.957
for all the storytellers
 in the community.

25:58.024 --> 26:00.559
I have been developing
 a little talk of my own.

26:00.627 --> 26:03.495
based on my brand,
 "To Shell N Back."

26:03.562 --> 26:05.131
It's kind of a
 one-woman show--

26:05.197 --> 26:07.166
No, Mom, we're not doing
your one-woman show.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.135
I haven't even told you
 anything yet.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.537
- At least hear me out.
- We're not even sure

26:11.604 --> 26:13.572
if we're gonna do another one
 of these, though, so--

26:13.640 --> 26:16.108
- Well, of course
we're gonna do it again.
- I would love--

26:16.175 --> 26:17.844
- At least let me audition.
 - Oh, my God. Jesus Christ!

26:17.910 --> 26:19.646
Yes, Mom, you got an audition.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.180
Oh! All I needed to hear.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.415
- Okay.
- Mmm. Love you.

26:23.482 --> 26:24.951
- Love you, too, Rabbi.
- Bye, Shelly.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.619
- Good to see you.
 - Nice the see you.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.054
You still have stuff
 in your teeth.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.189
Oh, all right.
I'll get it in the car.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.793
Of course
 we're gonna do this again.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.762
There'll be riots
 if we don't do it again.

26:39.999 --> 26:44.436
Okay, I found some of
 my sister's expired
 muscle relaxers

26:44.503 --> 26:46.405
and my Moppa's Xanax.

26:46.472 --> 26:47.807
- Perfect.
- There you go.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.950
I got that.
 That just falls if its there.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.586
Fuck, I love what we wrote
 together today.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.689
Really?

27:02.755 --> 27:04.156
I don't know.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.458
I liked your lines
a lot better than mine.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.627
I like how we sound together.

27:08.695 --> 27:09.896
Hmm.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.764
But honestly, kid, I--

27:11.831 --> 27:14.734
I just like seeing you.

27:14.801 --> 27:19.538
There is a lot to see,
 Ali Pfefferman.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.240
That is my name.

27:25.377 --> 27:29.782
I see all of you,
 Ali Pfefferman.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.752
You made me come out
 and name it.

27:32.819 --> 27:36.889
- Name what we are.
 - You should just rest
 and relax.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.490
We can talk about this later.

27:38.557 --> 27:42.261
The truth is,
 I'm afraid of my emotions.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.863
[clears throat]
 They frighten me.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.769
I am in love with you.
