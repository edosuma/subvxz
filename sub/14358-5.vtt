"The Block Party"

00:04.790 --> 00:08.150
<i>Here in the midwest,
fall is the best time of year.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:11.860
<i>Corn mazes, football booster club,
and in our neighborhood,</i>

00:11.895 --> 00:13.808
<i>the Birchwood Avenue
Block Party.</i>

00:14.040 --> 00:17.111
<i>If you live between
321 and 452 Birchwood Avenue,</i>

00:17.146 --> 00:18.220
<i>you're more than welcome.</i>

00:18.410 --> 00:21.169
<i>But if you don't, well,
you're out of luck.</i>

00:22.890 --> 00:25.161
<i>But the most exciting thing
about the block party</i>

00:25.196 --> 00:27.029
<i>is the Birchwood 500--</i>

00:27.430 --> 00:30.465
<i>Three nail-biting laps around
the block on your riding mower.</i>

00:31.030 --> 00:32.674
<i>The whole neighborhood looks
forward to it,<i></i></i>

00:32.944 --> 00:34.039
<i>especially the kids.</i>

00:34.300 --> 00:35.866
Lawnmower races are lame.

00:36.290 --> 00:37.728
<i>Well, most of them,
anyway.</i>

00:38.130 --> 00:39.619
<i>Axl's in that phase
right now</i>

00:39.654 --> 00:41.564
<i>where everyone
and everything is lame.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:43.274
Birthdays are lame.

00:44.490 --> 00:45.536
TV's lame.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.114
Food is lame.

00:48.220 --> 00:48.913
Hey.

00:49.043 --> 00:52.430
Last year, when Jack Meenahan won,
you said, "Don't worry, Dad.

00:52.465 --> 00:54.520
We'll get 'em next year."
<i>We.</i>

00:54.580 --> 00:55.860
And for that reason alone,

00:55.895 --> 00:57.145
I bet him
that the loser this year

00:57.180 --> 00:58.983
has to mow the other guy's
lawn for a year.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.617
Yeah, well,
that was lame.

01:01.570 --> 01:02.496
You know what's lame?

01:02.570 --> 01:04.250
Thinking
everything's lame is lame!

01:04.285 --> 01:06.537
- That's what's lame!
- Whatever!

01:07.580 --> 01:09.194
What I just yelled was lame,
wasn't it?

01:09.310 --> 01:11.825
Well, we're not allowed to yell
what we really want to.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.006
I'm supposed
to tell you something.

01:20.066 --> 01:21.358
It's important.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.230
<i>Important.</i>

01:24.160 --> 01:24.981
Well?

01:26.670 --> 01:29.640
They want to talk to you and Dad
about that test I had to take.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.541
- The Waterman-Ginsberg test?
- Yeah.

01:32.576 --> 01:34.644
Why'd I have
to take that test anyway?

01:34.896 --> 01:35.953
No reason.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.691
Then why'd they only give it to me
and the kid who sets things on fire?

01:40.440 --> 01:41.577
Mom, throw this.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.795
That was just
the day you took it.

01:44.865 --> 01:46.163
They give that test
to everyone.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.680
<i>They don't.</i>

01:48.260 --> 01:48.934
Throw it again.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.650
Wait.
Why am I doing this?

01:51.690 --> 01:53.947
Tryouts for tennis team
are next week. Yay!

01:54.550 --> 01:56.140
You're trying out
for tennis?

01:56.260 --> 01:58.188
No. Coach said
that's a long shot,

01:58.230 --> 02:00.359
but he did say there are
openings for ball girl.

02:00.509 --> 02:01.318
Yay!

02:07.030 --> 02:09.091
And I'm the one
who needs testing.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.893
<i>The reason Brick needed testing
was because...</i>

02:14.240 --> 02:17.405
<i>Well, the counselor explained it
so well, I'll let her tell it.</i>

02:17.680 --> 02:20.510
Brick's teachers referred him
for Waterman-Ginsberg testing

02:20.545 --> 02:23.301
because they observed that,
although very bright,

02:23.713 --> 02:25.308
your son struggles socially.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.684
In layman's terms, he has
a hard time making friends.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.930
We needed some $500 test
to tell us that?

02:31.965 --> 02:33.326
I could've told you that
for free.

02:33.426 --> 02:35.753
- Mike, let her finish.
- Thank you.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.992
The test revealed that
Brick is slightly challenged

02:39.027 --> 02:43.133
in his ability to establish
appropriate peer connections.

02:43.290 --> 02:44.460
I see.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.091
He has a hard time
making friends.

02:47.190 --> 02:48.183
Exactly.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.441
So there you have it.

02:52.860 --> 02:57.004
I-I think what my husband
and I are wondering is, why?

02:57.280 --> 02:59.550
Why does he have
a hard time making friends?

02:59.570 --> 03:02.571
Oh, who can say
why anyone does anything?

03:03.190 --> 03:05.332
You're supposed to,
for 500 bucks.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.120
Mike, let her finish.

03:07.681 --> 03:08.749
Oh, I'm done.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.856
Let me tell you something.

03:11.409 --> 03:13.638
Brick is
the happiest kid I know.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.624
Sure, he whispers
to himself.

03:15.710 --> 03:17.639
Sure,
he showers sitting down.

03:17.650 --> 03:20.521
Maybe he licked the car
once or twice.

03:21.190 --> 03:22.406
Hey, don't write
that down!

03:22.441 --> 03:24.083
I-I guess what
we were wondering is...

03:24.364 --> 03:26.422
Is there something
we should be doing?

03:27.420 --> 03:31.120
Well, what do you do now
to help him socialize?

03:34.100 --> 03:35.790
- I think--
- Shh!

03:38.290 --> 03:41.889
Oh, you know...
the usual.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.339
I'd do a little more
than that.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.622
So... should
we be concerned?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.650
I guess what I'd advise
is that you be concerned,

03:50.909 --> 03:52.568
but not overly concerned.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.092
Do what you can
and hope for the best.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.832
- That's it?
- That's it.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.683
Not so bad.

04:01.466 --> 04:03.820
Now doesn't it feel good
to have a plan?

04:06.610 --> 04:08.745
So how'd the kid
who lights things on fire do?

04:13.580 --> 04:16.704
<i>That stupid counselor meeting
left us more confused than ever.</i>

04:16.720 --> 04:18.471
<i>Why is everyone always
trying to convince you</i>

04:18.507 --> 04:19.890
<i>something's wrong
with your kids?</i>

04:19.899 --> 04:22.740
What is wrong with you?
That is for the block party.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.370
I can read.
I'm not stupid.

04:24.470 --> 04:26.298
We'll be the judge of
whether you're stupid or not.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.340
Now, I know
you own pants.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.723
I've seen them
draped over the TV.

04:28.966 --> 04:29.646
Go put 'em on.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.343
Oh, Mom, are you going
to the Booster Club thing

04:35.378 --> 04:36.471
at school on Friday?

04:37.810 --> 04:40.321
Well, I will
if you want me to.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.077
You sound like you do.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.642
You know,
that means so much to me.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.220
Oh, I miss you!

04:47.590 --> 04:48.957
Chill. Gross.

04:49.327 --> 04:50.958
Thought we talked
about this.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.177
What happened to him?

04:56.450 --> 04:58.400
I mean,
he used to be so sweet.

04:58.435 --> 04:59.495
Remember
when he was six

04:59.545 --> 05:01.392
and he made me
that clay giraffe?

05:02.490 --> 05:05.466
Thank you for being
the best mom ever.

05:07.170 --> 05:08.189
Should've kept that.

05:09.180 --> 05:10.417
So what are we gonna do?

05:10.470 --> 05:12.588
- About which one?
- The small one.

05:12.830 --> 05:13.342
I don't know.

05:13.392 --> 05:15.207
Maybe we didn't do
enough for Brick.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.223
He's a third kid.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.808
He's lucky
we remember to feed him.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.077
Looking good, Sue!

05:23.370 --> 05:24.894
She's trying out
for ball girl.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.365
Oh, I can't help thinking
it's my fault.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.846
She didn't make anything else.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.409
That's her fault--
not yours.

05:31.460 --> 05:32.663
No. We're on Brick now.

05:34.580 --> 05:35.715
Hard to keep track,
isn't it?

05:36.590 --> 05:38.384
I just feel like
I've slacked off.

05:38.430 --> 05:40.204
I used to try to set up
playdates for him,

05:40.255 --> 05:42.153
but I ran through every boy
in the neighborhood.

05:42.870 --> 05:43.693
I like juice.

05:45.510 --> 05:46.342
You do?

05:47.110 --> 05:49.361
Well, Brick likes juice, too,
don't you, Brick?

05:49.430 --> 05:51.841
Look at that!
Two juice-loving boys!

05:55.650 --> 05:56.398
Your move.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.050
Brick's catching up.
Going up the ladder...

06:05.085 --> 06:06.515
Good fun, huh, boys?

06:07.750 --> 06:09.104
I like juice, too.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.530
I hope you like
mint chocolate chip...

06:18.530 --> 06:20.429
Brick, what are you doing?

06:20.464 --> 06:21.849
You have a friend over.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.731
I just want a little privacy.
That kid is weird.

06:25.871 --> 06:26.869
<i>Weird.</i>

06:29.540 --> 06:32.269
Look, if you want, I can help
Brick make friends.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.900
But you know
what I'm gonna say.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.697
- Don't say it.
- Sports!

06:36.050 --> 06:37.456
There, I said it.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.541
Hey, Brick, get in here.

06:38.750 --> 06:39.778
This is Brick
we're talking about.

06:39.813 --> 06:40.540
He's gonna suck!

06:40.575 --> 06:41.406
Of course
he's gonna suck,

06:41.455 --> 06:43.404
but it's still the best way
for a boy to make friends.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.069
Hey, we're signing you
up for a team.

06:46.104 --> 06:46.952
What sport you like?

06:47.020 --> 06:48.070
I like basketball.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.425
See?
He likes basketball.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.879
That oughta be good
for some friends.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.185
Or get him beat up.

06:54.836 --> 06:55.669
By his friends.

06:57.730 --> 07:00.110
<i>Unfortunately, I couldn't make it
to Brick's first game</i>

07:00.145 --> 07:02.020
<i>because it was the same day
as Booster Club.</i>

07:02.180 --> 07:04.352
<i>I knew how important
it was to Axl</i>

07:04.387 --> 07:05.506
<i>for me to be there,</i>

07:05.560 --> 07:07.162
<i>and that made it
important to me.</i>

07:07.500 --> 07:09.393
<i>I had to suck up
every scrap of affection</i>

07:09.428 --> 07:10.597
<i>from him I could get.</i>

07:10.670 --> 07:12.560
Oh, yay, you're here!

07:12.870 --> 07:15.621
Barely. My boss thinks
I'm on a doughnut run.

07:15.622 --> 07:17.907
Remind me to steal some doughnuts
from the teachers' lounge.

07:18.110 --> 07:19.413
Oh, you can't, though.

07:19.448 --> 07:20.504
The boys
want to thank us

07:20.534 --> 07:22.320
for raising the money for
their new jerseys.

07:22.507 --> 07:23.572
It's a whole thing.

07:23.607 --> 07:24.560
It's a thing?

07:24.595 --> 07:26.796
Oh, that's why Axl
wanted me to come.

07:27.750 --> 07:32.048
- Um, isn't this Axl Heck's locker?
- That one.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:47.480 --> 07:48.554
Come on, guys!
Come on!

07:48.990 --> 07:51.077
Okay, now get out there,
play some ball

07:51.186 --> 07:52.885
and make some friends!
Hustle!

07:53.870 --> 07:55.188
Dad, why are you yelling?

07:55.810 --> 07:57.728
Because that's the way
we talk in sports.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.757
- Go get 'em!
- Okay, Dad!

07:59.758 --> 08:01.476
- Alright, alright!
- Boys, come on.

08:01.477 --> 08:02.300
Go, go, go!

08:05.210 --> 08:06.204
All right! Good start!

08:09.810 --> 08:13.047
Spalding.
It says "Spalding," Brick.

08:13.800 --> 08:14.962
Don't read the ball!

08:23.120 --> 08:24.798
We're okay, Dad!

08:35.250 --> 08:36.451
What?
What are you doing?

08:36.870 --> 08:38.923
Can you take me to
a book signing this weekend?

08:38.940 --> 08:40.679
My favorite writer
is going to be there.

08:40.714 --> 08:43.100
What? Yeah, sure, whatever.
Just get back out there.

08:43.101 --> 08:44.587
Hands out, hands out!

08:44.600 --> 08:46.127
Get your hands
out of your pockets.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.537
Ketchup packets?

08:50.730 --> 08:53.478
They're my security condiments.
They soothe me.

08:53.570 --> 08:54.776
You're playing
a basketball game.

08:54.805 --> 08:56.069
You're not supposed
to be soothed.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.150
Give me those things.

08:58.423 --> 08:59.787
Come on!
Get back in the game.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.141
And make a friend,
would ya?

09:04.970 --> 09:07.695
The guys just wanted
to do something nice for you, moms.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.424
Especially since <i>you</i>

09:09.505 --> 09:12.810
raised the money to get us
these killer new jerseys, right?

09:12.811 --> 09:14.417
Yeah!

09:17.450 --> 09:19.496
And, uh,
I-I know it's not much, but...

09:20.130 --> 09:23.395
Mom, I want you
to have my old jersey.

09:25.370 --> 09:27.217
Yeah, Mom, you rock!

09:32.796 --> 09:33.649
Hey.

09:35.030 --> 09:37.940
I'd like to give my jersey
to a special lady

09:37.975 --> 09:40.712
who might not know
just how special she is.

09:41.070 --> 09:42.255
<i>There it was.<i></i></i>

09:42.870 --> 09:45.837
<i>I complain it's hard to get out
of work for the boosting and all,</i>

09:45.970 --> 09:49.241
<i>but it's these little moments
that make it all worthwhile.</i>

09:52.120 --> 09:54.480
Sophie, I think
you're really hot.

10:01.950 --> 10:02.925
<i>Keep smiling.</i>

10:03.390 --> 10:04.943
<i>You can cry in the car.</i>

10:07.900 --> 10:10.242
<i>Okay, so Axl
didn't give me his jersey.</i>

10:10.270 --> 10:11.668
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

10:15.410 --> 10:16.553
<i>It was a huge deal.</i>

10:16.700 --> 10:18.477
<i>Where's the $500 test</i>

10:18.512 --> 10:20.866
<i>to tell me how I ended up
with a clueless bonehead</i>

10:20.901 --> 10:23.036
<i>who doesn't even know
how to thank his mother?</i>

10:26.270 --> 10:28.138
So... how'd it go?

10:28.770 --> 10:31.460
Good. It was a little loud, but
I got some reading done.

10:31.495 --> 10:32.584
I don't get it, Brick.

10:32.619 --> 10:34.304
You said
you liked basketball.

10:34.390 --> 10:35.604
I do like basketball.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.526
I like all words
with three syllables--

10:37.922 --> 10:41.845
Pineapple, hypnotize,
lacerate...

10:42.085 --> 10:43.040
This is fun.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.205
I'm gonna go put on my pajamas
and make a list.

10:45.689 --> 10:47.875
Hey! Pa-ja-mas.

10:51.090 --> 10:52.532
That's it. I'm out.

10:52.590 --> 10:54.036
What--what--what do
you mean, you're out?

10:54.160 --> 10:55.871
It was a disaster.

10:56.629 --> 10:58.490
It's not that
he was even bad.

10:58.820 --> 11:02.598
- He was just... weird.
- Damn it.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.702
I was hoping it was gonna be
like the U2 video

11:04.763 --> 11:07.000
where the odd kid who sat
on the bench the whole time

11:07.035 --> 11:08.537
makes the basket
and saves the game

11:08.572 --> 11:11.321
- and everybody loves him.
- Yeah, it wasn't like that.

11:12.490 --> 11:14.615
- So what do we do now?
- I told you, I'm out.

11:14.860 --> 11:17.537
I'm gonna work on something
I can understand--the lawnmower.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.202
- You don't get to be out.
- I'm out.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.451
You don't get
to be out!

11:25.190 --> 11:27.480
<i>He was out--
Out hiding in the garage,</i>

11:27.515 --> 11:29.648
<i>while I spent the week
avoiding my other son</i>

11:29.649 --> 11:33.280
<i>who had lacerated
my heart... until...</i>

11:33.540 --> 11:35.466
Sue, what happened
to your face?

11:36.230 --> 11:37.420
She was born that way.

11:37.710 --> 11:38.543
Axl.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.298
I didn't make ball girl.

11:44.630 --> 11:46.203
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.775
I got hit in the face
with a racket.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.660
- Stupid.
- Axl.

11:51.970 --> 11:54.440
No, not her. Me.

11:54.475 --> 11:56.669
Stupid for giving my jersey
to Sophie.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.032
Oh, really?
What do you mean?

12:00.970 --> 12:02.079
She doesn't like me.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.634
Oh, that's terrible.

12:04.670 --> 12:07.040
<i>Oh, that's awesome!
Here was my opening.</i>

12:07.075 --> 12:08.255
<i>I was gonna
get that jersey,</i>

12:08.286 --> 12:10.364
<i>and I was gonna get Axl
to give it to me.</i>

12:10.425 --> 12:11.280
So what happened?

12:11.315 --> 12:13.780
I got hit when I ran out onto
the court to get the ball,

12:13.980 --> 12:15.405
but the point
was still going on.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.923
Oh, honey.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.665
No, to the jersey, I mean.
Did ya, you know, get it back?

12:19.810 --> 12:20.352
No.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.063
After the guy hit me
with his racket,

12:22.098 --> 12:24.110
he smashed into me
and knocked me into the net.

12:24.770 --> 12:26.315
Oh, honey,
that's horrible.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.685
Don't you think you should
ask her to give it back?

12:28.720 --> 12:32.669
- You know, for closure?
- Nah, not worth it.

12:32.690 --> 12:34.431
And after he knocked me
into the net,

12:34.553 --> 12:36.380
my braces got stuck
in the strings.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.939
The nurses had to cut me
out with nail scissors.

12:38.979 --> 12:40.897
Oh, sweetheart!

12:41.200 --> 12:43.565
Gosh, it sounds like
it just wasn't meant to be.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.021
I don't know.

12:45.071 --> 12:46.981
I think you might want
to get it back.

12:47.150 --> 12:49.330
It's your jersey,
and it's very valuable.

12:49.890 --> 12:53.615
There could be someone out there
who wants it very badly.

12:56.070 --> 12:56.926
Wait.

12:58.830 --> 12:59.857
You think
I could sell it?

13:01.930 --> 13:02.567
I'm out.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.572
<i>Turns out, Mike didn't
understand the lawnmower</i>

13:08.607 --> 13:10.153
<i>any more than
he understood Brick.</i>

13:12.180 --> 13:13.153
What are you doing?

13:13.530 --> 13:14.658
I'm looking for the manual

13:14.693 --> 13:16.853
so I can put this damn thing
back together again.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.452
Can I help?

13:18.873 --> 13:20.450
Uh, no,
not really, buddy.

13:20.485 --> 13:21.642
Why don't you just
go back to bed?

13:22.070 --> 13:25.532
Okay. But your brake pad
is in the wrong place.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.279
- Mm, how you know that?
- I read the manual.

13:28.370 --> 13:29.981
It goes on
the jackshaft pulley.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.441
Pull the brake pad away
from the jackshaft pulley

13:32.476 --> 13:33.630
to install the drive belt.

13:33.665 --> 13:36.321
See diagram "B"
on page 32.

13:36.490 --> 13:38.145
It had
a smooshed bug on it.

13:38.810 --> 13:39.801
How do you do that?

13:40.044 --> 13:41.970
I remember
everything I read.

13:42.410 --> 13:44.458
Do you need to fix
the margarita maker?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.117
I read the manual
for that, too.

13:47.270 --> 13:49.586
No. No,
let's just work on this.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.028
<i>The block party
was finally here,</i>

13:55.057 --> 13:56.946
<i>and my worries
were melting away.</i>

13:57.450 --> 13:58.484
<i>I don't know
if it was 'cause</i>

13:58.519 --> 14:00.337
<i>Mike and Brick fixed
the lawnmower together,</i>

14:00.500 --> 14:02.520
<i>or Mike and Brick
fixed the margarita maker.</i>

14:03.550 --> 14:05.228
<i>Who am I kidding?
I knew.</i>

14:06.280 --> 14:08.352
I wouldn't say I was gonna get
the whole thing back together,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.509
and then Brick here came in
and just...

14:11.260 --> 14:13.542
Brick, tell 'em
the first line on page 26.

14:14.010 --> 14:15.187
"To adjust shift levers,

14:15.222 --> 14:17.182
stop engine and
disconnect the adjuster nut

14:17.252 --> 14:18.251
from the shifter yoke."

14:18.530 --> 14:20.020
<i>Shifter yoke.</i>

14:20.880 --> 14:21.917
How about that, huh?

14:22.510 --> 14:25.359
What's the last line
on page 50?

14:25.610 --> 14:28.229
"Attach the cotter pin and
brake spring to the locknut

14:28.264 --> 14:30.500
before installing it in
the brake lever assembly."

14:30.950 --> 14:32.027
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

14:32.670 --> 14:34.213
<i>Brick was actually having
a conversation</i>

14:34.248 --> 14:35.524
<i>with the Harrison boy and--</i>

14:35.720 --> 14:38.017
<i>dare I say it--
making a friend.</i>

14:38.730 --> 14:41.950
- What's on page--
- Okay, I'm done talking to you now.

14:43.030 --> 14:43.988
<i>Baby steps.</i>

14:46.320 --> 14:47.451
<i>Look at 'em
over there--</i>

14:47.452 --> 14:49.800
<i>All shrouded
in their sons' love.</i>

15:01.980 --> 15:03.341
Here's the thing, Sophie.

15:03.510 --> 15:06.040
We both know you don't care
about that jersey,

15:06.075 --> 15:07.344
so why don't you
give it to me?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.099
And there's no hard feelings.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.384
I can't do that.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.807
Look, you don't
intimidate me.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.212
I was a cheerleader once.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.522
I had spirit,
yes, I did.

15:16.720 --> 15:20.120
And now
I'm just a cranky, tired mom

15:20.155 --> 15:23.056
- with nothing to lose.
- I already gave it back to Axl.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.029
He said he wanted
to give it to someone else.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.378
Well, then.
Never mind.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.552
It was so nice
to have met you.

15:36.010 --> 15:38.447
- You're gonna mow my yard.
- You're gonna mow <i>my</i> yard.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.022
- You're gonna mow my yard.
- You're gonna mow <i>my</i> yard.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.207
<i>In Orson, Indiana, that's
some serious trash-talking.</i>

15:45.760 --> 15:49.887
Gentlemen,
start your mowers!

16:08.000 --> 16:09.553
Hear you got
your jersey back.

16:09.796 --> 16:10.541
Uh-huh.

16:11.230 --> 16:14.022
I also heard you want
to give it to somebody else.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.213
Uh, yeah.

16:15.995 --> 16:16.774
Well?

16:17.390 --> 16:18.612
I already gave it
to her.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.766
What? Her?

16:21.472 --> 16:23.027
You gave it
to another girl?

16:23.190 --> 16:24.008
Yeah, whatever.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.569
Are you kidding me?!

16:25.969 --> 16:28.478
What is the matter
with you?

16:29.190 --> 16:30.393
I keep telling myself

16:30.454 --> 16:33.145
that you're still that same kid
who gave me that clay giraffe,

16:33.208 --> 16:35.724
but I don't think that boy's
in there anymore.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.183
I mean, how can you be
so insensitive?

16:38.470 --> 16:41.463
Do you have any idea
how much I do for you?

16:41.620 --> 16:42.802
And when you
get the chance

16:42.942 --> 16:45.164
to give me a little shout-out,
what do you do?

16:45.270 --> 16:47.240
You embarrass me
instead,

16:47.279 --> 16:51.951
and that... oh, that, Mister,
is what I think is lame.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.628
Did I miss
much of the race?

16:58.730 --> 16:59.755
What are you doing
with that?

17:01.420 --> 17:02.584
Axl gave it to me.

17:03.010 --> 17:03.493
What?

17:04.319 --> 17:07.348
Yeah, he said he felt bad
about me not making ball girl.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.301
This is why
I didn't tell you!

17:14.810 --> 17:16.481
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

17:16.516 --> 17:17.984
<i>He was
the same sweet kid</i>

17:18.035 --> 17:19.667
<i>who had given me
the clay giraffe.</i>

17:20.069 --> 17:22.727
<i>He was currently hiding in the shell
of a hideous teenager,</i>

17:22.900 --> 17:24.896
<i>but there was a glimmer
he'd be back.</i>

17:24.931 --> 17:26.073
Mom!

17:27.650 --> 17:29.452
I love you, too, honey.

17:30.970 --> 17:31.939
Can I have
a wine cooler?

17:32.281 --> 17:32.949
No.

17:37.060 --> 17:39.693
<i>This block party was shaping up
to be the best one ever--</i>

17:40.220 --> 17:42.531
<i>Even better than the one where
the kids were out of town.</i>

17:43.160 --> 17:45.943
<i>Looked like Mike was finally
gonna beat Jack Meenahan...</i>

17:50.610 --> 17:51.897
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

17:51.970 --> 17:53.866
Brick, what the hell
are you doing?

17:54.110 --> 17:56.507
Dad, we gotta go--
the book signing.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.182
What? What are you
talking about?

17:58.330 --> 18:01.356
You said you'd take me
to the book signing, remember?

18:01.391 --> 18:02.503
At basketball?

18:02.870 --> 18:05.143
Can you take me to a book
signing this weekend?

18:05.170 --> 18:06.970
My favorite writer
is going to be there.

18:07.005 --> 18:08.878
What?
Yeah, sure, whatever.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.007
You said,
"Yeah, sure, whatever."

18:11.350 --> 18:13.688
The bookstore
closes in a half hour.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.756
Uh, Brick, I'm kind of
in the middle of a race here.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.188
That's okay.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.875
Later, loser!

19:01.290 --> 19:01.976
Hop on.

19:02.760 --> 19:03.533
Really?

19:03.640 --> 19:05.002
We're going
to the bookstore!

19:05.340 --> 19:08.593
- Shouldn't we take the car?
- Nah. I know a shortcut.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.537
<i>That's the thing
about Brick--</i>

19:13.930 --> 19:15.975
<i>He's always gonna go down
his own path.</i>

19:16.290 --> 19:17.420
<i>Instead of fighting it,</i>

19:17.470 --> 19:19.670
<i>Mike decided to meet Brick
on his terms</i>

19:19.705 --> 19:22.092
<i>and just veered right off
the path there with him.</i>

19:22.680 --> 19:25.180
<i>I guess that counselor
wasn't so wrong after all.</i>

19:25.570 --> 19:26.957
<i>When it
comes to your kids,</i>

19:27.180 --> 19:29.204
<i>all you can really do
is be concerned.</i>

19:29.591 --> 19:30.954
<i>But not overly concerned.</i>

19:31.270 --> 19:34.030
<i>Do what you can
and hope for the best.</i>

19:36.830 --> 19:39.284
Dad, you're going
through the Meenahans' yard.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.934
It's okay. I'm gonna
have to mow it anyway.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.517
<i>Hey, maybe I could sneak
into her drawer later</i>

19:58.568 --> 20:00.554
<i>when she's sleeping
and get that jersey.</i>

20:01.210 --> 20:02.523
<i>Eh, I don't know.</i>
