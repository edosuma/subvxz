WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:04.035
(clock ticking)
(Meredith) HOW MUCH

00:04.035 --> 00:06.507
CAN YOU ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH
IN AN HOUR?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.008
RUN AN ERRAND MAYBE?

00:08.008 --> 00:09.510
SIT IN TRAFFIC?

00:09.510 --> 00:12.043
GET AN OIL CHANGE?

00:12.043 --> 00:13.344
(ticking continues)

00:13.344 --> 00:16.147
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
AN HOUR ISN'T VERY LONG.

00:16.147 --> 00:19.490
(ticking speeds up)
60 MINUTES.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.222
3,600 SECONDS.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.054
(fast ticking continues)
THAT'S IT.

00:23.054 --> 00:25.025
IN MEDICINE, THOUGH,

00:25.025 --> 00:27.027
AN HOUR IS OFTEN EVERYTHING.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.201
(clock ticking normally)

00:30.201 --> 00:32.703
WE CALL IT THE GOLDEN HOUR.

00:32.703 --> 00:34.535
(ticking continues)

00:34.535 --> 00:36.537
THAT MAGICAL WINDOW OF TIME

00:36.537 --> 00:40.541
THAT CAN DETERMINE
WHETHER A PATIENT LIVES...

00:40.541 --> 00:48.719
OR DIES.
(siren wails)

00:48.719 --> 00:50.221
(clock ticking)

00:50.221 --> 00:52.223
(indistinct conversations)

00:52.223 --> 00:54.585
(ticking continues)

00:54.585 --> 00:57.088
(siren wailing)

00:57.088 --> 01:01.092
(indistinct conversations
continue)

01:01.092 --> 01:02.593
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

01:02.593 --> 01:04.595
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME AT ALL

01:04.595 --> 01:08.399
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA SIT THERE
AND EAT POTATO CHIPS?

01:08.399 --> 01:12.443
I PERFORMED FOUR BACK-TO-BACK
FEM-POP BYPASSES TODAY.

01:12.443 --> 01:14.805
THIS IS THE FIRST CHAIR
I'VE SEEN SINCE 7:00 A.M.,

01:14.805 --> 01:17.808
AND THIS IS THE FIRST FOOD
I'VE HAD SINCE YESTERDAY.

01:17.808 --> 01:19.810
I CHOOSE POTATO CHIPS.

01:19.810 --> 01:23.214
(telephone ringing)
(mouth full)
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET THAT.

01:23.214 --> 01:25.256
(ring)

01:25.256 --> 01:26.587
(ring)

01:26.587 --> 01:28.689
(chuckles) SEATTLE GRACE
MERCY WEST EMERGENCY.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.222
YOU BROUGHT THIS
ON YOURSELF, YOU KNOW?

01:31.222 --> 01:33.364
(lowered voice) YOU VOLUNTEERED
TO HELP RUN THE E.R.?
GOT IT.

01:33.364 --> 01:35.826
WE'VE GOT A SUSPECTED APPY
ON A 10 YEAR OLD.

01:35.826 --> 01:38.329
LET'S PAGE ROBBINS. YOU KNOW,
I SAW A NEED AND I FILLED IT,

01:38.329 --> 01:40.100
LIKE ANY GOOD
CHIEF RESIDENT CANDIDATE.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.874
(normal voice) SADOMASOCHISTIC
CHIEF RESIDENT CANDIDATE MAYBE.
(laughs)

01:43.874 --> 01:46.477
WHAT IS UP WITH YOU?

01:46.477 --> 01:48.179
YOU'RE ALL PERKY AND CHEERFUL.

01:48.179 --> 01:50.641
AH, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE, UH,
FERTILITY DRUGS.

01:50.641 --> 01:52.783
WE HAVE STEPPED IT UP.
I'M PUMPED FULL OF HORMONES.

01:52.783 --> 01:54.445
YOU KNOW WHAT'S PERKY?

01:54.445 --> 01:55.786
QUOI?

01:55.786 --> 01:57.288
MY BOOBS. THEY'RE HUGE.

01:57.288 --> 01:59.290
(laughs)
AM I SUPPOSED TO LIKE
BIG BOOBS?

01:59.290 --> 02:01.392
OH, GOD, NO.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU FALL OVER.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.494
SO, UM... (crunches)

02:03.494 --> 02:07.698
CALLIE MENTIONED A THING.
OR IT MIGHT NOT BE A THING.

02:07.698 --> 02:10.461
AT LEAST I HOPE
IT DOESN'T BECOME A THING.
HEY, I GOT A PATIENT

02:10.461 --> 02:12.463
WITH A HEADACHE
BETTER AFTER SUMATRIPTAN.

02:12.463 --> 02:15.906
HE'S READY TO BE DISCHARGED.
JUST NEED YOU TO SIGN OFF.
IS HE NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT?

02:15.906 --> 02:17.908
MM-HMM.
YOU DID A C.T.?

02:17.908 --> 02:19.910
I DID. IT WAS NEGATIVE.
THE MOST INTERESTING THING

02:19.910 --> 02:21.912
ABOUT THIS GUY
IS THAT HE CAME INTO THE E.R.

02:21.912 --> 02:24.275
FOR A GLORIFIED MIGRAINE
WITH A GIRLFRIEND FROM HELL.
OOH, WHICH ONE IS SHE?

02:24.275 --> 02:26.146
JUST POINT WITH YOUR EYES.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.319
NO, I MEAN, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST NOT A PRIORITY

02:28.319 --> 02:30.221
RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY...
(speaks indistinctly)

02:30.221 --> 02:31.722
MM-HMM.
(laughs)

02:31.722 --> 02:33.424
(crunches) MM-HMM.

02:33.424 --> 02:35.656
HERE.
THANK YOU.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.658
SO, UM, CALLIE HAD A THING.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.490
YEAH.
WHAT KIND OF A THING?

02:39.490 --> 02:43.334
GREY, YOU PAGED?
YEAH, WE HAVE A SUSPECTED APPY
ON A 10 YEAR OLD

02:43.334 --> 02:45.266
TWO MINUTES OUT.
OKAY.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.168
AN UNEXPECTED THING.
GREY, CALL UP. TELL 'EM
TO GET AN O.R. READY.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.501
I ALREADY DID. O.R. FIVE
IS PREPPED AND READY FOR YOU.

02:50.501 --> 02:53.774
CALLIE ASKED ME TO BE
HER BABY'S GODMOTHER.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.676
OH.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.678
WELL, YOU SAID NO TO THAT,
RIGHT?

02:57.678 --> 03:00.481
YOU GOTTA SAY NO TO THAT.

03:00.481 --> 03:04.255
UM...

03:04.255 --> 03:06.287
E.K.G. RESULTS.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.718
THANK YOU.

03:07.718 --> 03:10.391
THE GUYS AT WORK OVERREACTED
AND INSISTED I COME TO THE E.R.

03:10.391 --> 03:14.265
SWEETIE, I HAD A BIG LUNCH. IT
HARDLY QUALIFIES AS CHEST PAIN.

03:14.265 --> 03:16.867
NO, WHAT I NEED
ARE SOME ANTACIDS.

03:16.867 --> 03:20.331
I'LL BE THERE. I PROMISE. JUST
TELL MAX TO PUT ON HIS JERSEY.

03:20.331 --> 03:22.333
OKAY?
I'LL BE OUTTA HERE SOON.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.734
(cell phone beeps)

03:23.734 --> 03:26.206
HI, I'M DR. GREY.
I'LL BE YOUR DOCTOR TODAY.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
OLIVER RICHTER.
SORRY ABOUT THE PHONE.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
PICKING UP MY SON

03:30.210 --> 03:32.583
FOR THE HUSKIES GAME
RIGHT NOW.
I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.585
(chuckles) YOU DON'T KNOW
MY SON.

03:34.585 --> 03:36.887
THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS
MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM

03:36.887 --> 03:39.350
THAN BASKETBALL.
BIG FAN, HUH?

03:39.350 --> 03:42.593
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE
A QUICK LISTEN.
ALL RIGHT.

03:42.593 --> 03:44.595
THE BIGGEST 9-YEAR-OLD FAN
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

03:44.595 --> 03:47.258
(laughs)

03:47.258 --> 03:49.400
(exhales deeply)

03:49.400 --> 03:51.902
OKAY. SO IT SAYS HERE

03:51.902 --> 03:53.904
THAT YOU'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING
SOME CHEST PAIN.

03:53.904 --> 03:57.268
WHEN DID THAT START?
UH, AN HOUR AGO, MAYBE TWO?

03:57.268 --> 03:59.270
BUT I'M ALREADY FEELING
MUCH BETTER.

03:59.270 --> 04:01.612
AND YOU WOULDN'T JUST BE SAYING
THAT TO GET DISCHARGED FASTER?

04:01.612 --> 04:05.376
LOOK, I GOT MY SON TICKETS
TO THIS GAME FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

04:05.376 --> 04:07.448
HE'S BEEN MARKING OFF THE DAYS
ON HIS CALENDAR FOR WEEKS.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.520
I CAN'T BE THE REASON
HE MISSES IT.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.522
OKAY. WELL, YOUR E.K.G.
LOOKS NORMAL,

04:11.522 --> 04:13.524
AND YOUR HEART SOUNDS GOOD,
BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING

04:13.524 --> 04:16.457
WE DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY AROUND
HERE, IT'S CHEST PAIN, SO...

04:16.457 --> 04:19.330
COULD WE GO BACK AND JUST
PRETEND I SAID HEARTBURN?

04:19.330 --> 04:22.262
WOULD THAT GET ME OUT
ANY FASTER?
NO, PROBABLY NOT.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.396
(laughs) BUT TYLER IS GOING
TO DO A PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY.

04:25.396 --> 04:28.399
AND WE'RE GONNA DO
A CHEST PAIN WORKUP,

04:28.399 --> 04:31.472
AND WE WILL TRY TO MAKE IT
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.643
OKAY?

04:32.643 --> 04:35.306
(sighs) THANKS, DR. GREY,
SO MUCH. THANKS.

04:37.348 --> 04:40.050
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

04:40.050 --> 04:42.713
SO... THISIS
GONNA BE A THING.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.516
WHY AM I
TELLING CALLIE NO AGAIN?

04:45.516 --> 04:47.017
UM, WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

04:47.017 --> 04:49.520
I NEED A SECOND OPINION
ON THIS E.K.G.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.021
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

04:51.021 --> 04:53.664
NO. LOOKS, UH, NORMAL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:53.664 --> 04:55.766
THOUGHT YOU HAD
THE NIGHT OFF.
YEAH, I DO. I'M NOT HERE.

04:55.766 --> 04:59.299
WHAT'S MEDICAL RECORDS'
EXTENSION?
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HERE TO ME,
WHICH IS GOOD,

04:59.299 --> 05:00.931
BECAUSE WE'RE SWAMPED.
TAKE YOUR PICK--

05:00.931 --> 05:03.334
IMPACTED BOWEL, SUSPICIOUS RASH,
OR REALLY SMELLY GUY.

05:03.334 --> 05:05.406
FORGET IT. I ONLY CAME IN
'CAUSE MEDICAL RECORDS CALLED

05:05.406 --> 05:07.608
AND SAID I HAD TO SIGN
ALL MY UNSIGNED CHARTS

05:07.608 --> 05:10.341
OR THEY WOULD SUSPEND
MY PRIVILEGES.
YOU'RE GETTING SUSPENDED?

05:10.341 --> 05:12.343
DIBS ON HIS
SOLO SPLENECTOMY TOMORROW.

05:12.343 --> 05:14.485
I BETTER BE ABLE TO FINISH THIS
CRAP BEFORE THE GAME TONIGHT.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.487
TOLD A PATIENT YESTERDAY
HE DIDN'T HAVE CANCER,

05:16.487 --> 05:19.920
AND HE WAS SO HAPPY,
HE GAVE ME TWO FLOOR SEATS.
YOU TOOK A GIFT
FROM A PATIENT?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.992
DID YOU TELL HIM
YOUCUREDHIS CANCER?

05:21.992 --> 05:24.355
(pager beeps and buzzes)

05:24.355 --> 05:26.627
UH,COLECTOMY TIME.
I'M OUT.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.700
(child crying)
EXCUSE ME. HI, I-I'M SORRY.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.662
UH, WE WERE TOLD
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE BY

05:31.662 --> 05:34.465
TO SET OUR SON'S LEG--
NATHAN ENGLUNDAR.
(whimpers)

05:34.465 --> 05:37.468
IT WAS A WHILE AGO. SEVERAL
HOURS, ACTUALLY. AND I WAS--
NO, I KNOW. YOU'VE BEEN HERE
A WHILE. I'M SORRY.

05:37.468 --> 05:40.471
THE PROBLEM IS, WE JUST DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH O.R.s AVAILABLE

05:40.471 --> 05:42.773
FOR NON-EMERGENT CASES.
AN O.R.? WHY WOULD YOU NEED
AN O.R.?

05:42.773 --> 05:44.775
YOUR PEDIATRICIAN HASN'T
BEEN BY TO SPEAK TO YOU YET?

05:44.775 --> 05:47.718
YOUR SON HAS A BROKEN FEMUR,
WHICH IS A SEVERE BREAK.
(crying)

05:47.718 --> 05:51.482
IT REQUIRES A FULL CAST ON
THE BROKEN LEG, CONNECTED TO...
(phone buttons beep)

05:51.482 --> 05:53.724
A CAST ON THE OTHER LEG
TO KEEP EVERYTHING STILL

05:53.724 --> 05:56.857
SO THE BONES
WILL HEAL PROPERLY.
2 FULL-LEG CASTS
ON A 4 YEAR OLD?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
AND BECAUSE YOUR SON
IS SO YOUNG, WE CAN'T

05:58.859 --> 06:01.792
SET THE BONES PROPERLY
WITHOUT PUTTING HIM UNDER.
UNDER MEANING ANESTHESIA?

06:01.792 --> 06:04.395
AND THAT REQUIRES AN O.R.

06:04.395 --> 06:06.697
I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
WAITING A LONG TIME.

06:06.697 --> 06:09.540
AS SOON AS AN O.R. OPENS UP,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.371
OKAY.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.475
THE LOSERS IN MEDICAL RECORDS
AREN'T ANSWERING.
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T STAY

06:14.475 --> 06:17.478
AND HELP OUT
WITH SOME OF THIS STUFF?
FLOOR SEATS.

06:17.478 --> 06:21.582
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.984
I KNOW IT IS DONE

06:23.984 --> 06:26.787
BY MANY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS
IN THIS HOSPITAL.
(clicking keyboard keys)

06:26.787 --> 06:29.490
BUT I AM NOT
A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL

06:29.490 --> 06:31.161
WHO WOULD EVER CONSIDER--

06:31.161 --> 06:33.624
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT.

06:33.624 --> 06:37.397
(laughs) ELI LLOYD...
DO NOT TEST ME.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.670
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS.

06:39.670 --> 06:44.004
ALL THE INTENSELY EXCITING,
TOE-CURLING POTENTIAL...

06:44.004 --> 06:46.076
(whispers) BENEFITS.

06:46.076 --> 06:48.408
DR. BAILEY.

06:51.782 --> 06:54.485
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:54.485 --> 06:56.487
OKAY, UH, THIS IS GONNA BE

06:56.487 --> 06:58.489
FOR A PRESCRIPTION-STRENGTH
MIGRAINE MEDICINE.

06:58.489 --> 07:00.491
JUST DON'T TAKE IT
WITH ALCOHOL.

07:00.491 --> 07:02.422
OKAY.
WE'RE MISSING
OUR ANNIVERSARY DINNER

07:02.422 --> 07:05.456
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A HEADACHE.
A HEADACHE.

07:05.456 --> 07:08.559
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO
GET RESERVATIONS AT THIS PLACE?
I'M SORRY, GIA. I AM.
BUT IT REALLY HURTS.

07:08.559 --> 07:11.431
HMM.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.605
HI, I'M DR. GREY.
I'LL BE--

07:14.605 --> 07:16.837
OH, MRS. WEBBER.
HI, DEAR. HOW ARE YOU?

07:16.837 --> 07:19.840
I'M FINE. HOW ARE YOU?
DOES THE CHIEF KNOW YOU'RE HERE?
OH, PLEASE DON'T BOTHER HIM.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.543
I HAD A LITTLE FALL IS ALL.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.445
GOT HOME FROM WORK,
SLIPPED OFF THE STEPLADDER--

07:25.445 --> 07:27.748
(inhales sharply) OHH--
LANDED ON MY WRIST.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.750
OH, IT'S BASICALLY NOTHING.
OHH.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.722
WELL, IT'S NOT NOTHING.

07:31.722 --> 07:34.685
WELL, I-I BROUGHT LOTS
OF MAGAZINES AND A GOOD NOVEL.

07:34.685 --> 07:37.758
I AM PERFECTLY FINE WAITING
UNTIL YOU MAKE TIME FOR ME.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.531
I KNOW YOU HAVE
FAR MORE PRESSING PATIENTS.

07:40.531 --> 07:42.032
WELL, YOU'RE THE CHIEF'S WIFE,

07:42.032 --> 07:44.565
SO THAT MAKES YOU
MY MOST PRESSING PATIENT.
OH.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.968
(man) LOOK, STEW-MAN. THEY
OPENED THE DOORS RIGHT FOR US.
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.970
THIS IS GONNA BE FAST.
WE'LL BE IN AND OUT, MAN.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.973
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME DRIVE, DUDE.
DUDE, YOU'RE DRUNKER
THAN I AM.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.475
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TRIED
TO STIFF THE CABBIE.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
WOW, IT IS BRIGHT IN HERE.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.611
HEY, COULD SOMEBODY
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?

08:00.611 --> 08:04.114
(siren wailing)

08:13.624 --> 08:16.627
(clock ticking)

08:16.627 --> 08:19.129
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:19.129 --> 08:22.202
YOU'RE A LITTLE EARLY.
I THOUGHT OUR DATE WAS AT 6:30.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.205
WELL, I'M HERE NOW BECAUSE
A GUY JUST WALKED INTO THE PIT

08:25.205 --> 08:27.738
WITH A KNIFE
STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD.
SWEET.

08:27.738 --> 08:29.710
I MEAN, POOR GUY.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.212
IS HE STABLE?
HE'S NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT,
BUT--

08:32.212 --> 08:34.514
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I NEED TO CHECK ON HIM

08:34.514 --> 08:37.087
SOONER THAN LATER,
SO, AVERY, TAKE HIM DOWN TO C.T.

08:37.087 --> 08:39.590
STAY WITH HIM
UNTIL I GET THERE.
ALL RIGHT. WILL DO.

08:39.590 --> 08:42.192
OKAY, SO YOU'LL BE DOWN TO SEE
KNIFE GUY WHEN YOU'RE DONE?
I WILL.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.995
AND THEN
WE'LL HAVE OUR DATE?
WOULDN'T MISS IT.

08:44.995 --> 08:47.658
6:30. DON'T FORGET.

08:47.658 --> 08:49.660
HOW DID THIS GUY GET
A KNIFE IN HIS HEAD?

08:49.660 --> 08:52.162
OH, APPARENTLY THERE WAS
A BRAWL AT A TAILGATE PARTY.

08:52.162 --> 08:54.565
SO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID
GUYS GET--DR. BAILEY.

08:54.565 --> 08:56.867
(elevator bell dings)
UH, I'M TAKING A NAP.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.569
UH, I'M SORRY.

08:58.569 --> 09:00.571
WHAT I-I MEAN TO SAY IS,

09:00.571 --> 09:03.674
I'M GOING TO USE THIS ROOM
TO TAKE A NAP,

09:03.674 --> 09:05.746
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO
IN THESE ROOMS

09:05.746 --> 09:07.778
WHEN THEY'RE TIRED,

09:07.778 --> 09:10.851
'CAUSE I-I HAVE A CHILD
AND A FULL-TIME JOB,

09:10.851 --> 09:12.723
AND WORK LONG HOURS,

09:12.723 --> 09:14.655
SO I'M JUST TIRED,

09:14.655 --> 09:17.788
JUST VERY...
(yawning) VERY TIRED.

09:17.788 --> 09:20.861
(elevator bell dings)
(mutters)

09:20.861 --> 09:22.292
OKAY.

09:22.292 --> 09:23.994
OKAY.

09:23.994 --> 09:26.036
I-I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU,
HAD YOU SEEN DR. ALTMAN?

09:26.036 --> 09:28.699
D--NO,
I HAVE NOT SEEN DR. ALTMAN

09:28.699 --> 09:31.702
NOR ANY OTHER DOCTORS
OR NURSES,

09:31.702 --> 09:35.776
BECAUSE I WILL BE IN THIS ROOM
ASLEEP, BY MYSELF.

09:37.107 --> 09:41.211
ACTUALLY, I SEE HER NOW.
DR. ALTMAN.

09:41.211 --> 09:42.713
(yawns)

09:42.713 --> 09:45.886
I'M--I'M--I...

09:45.886 --> 09:48.588
DR. ALTMAN, DO YOU HAVE TIME
FOR A QUICK CONSULT?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.590
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OFF
BY 6:00, BUT--

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
OH, OKAY, SURE. OKAY.
JUST WALK WITH ME.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.594
OKAY, SO--
OH, DAMN IT.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.767
HE'S EARLY. UM...

09:56.767 --> 10:00.671
ALL RIGHT, JUST, UH, GREY,
GIVE ME A SECOND.

10:00.671 --> 10:03.734
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

10:03.734 --> 10:05.605
HI, UH, WILLIAM.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.608
HEY.
IT'S, UH,
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.610
WOW. YOU LOOK AMAZING.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.182
OH. (chuckles)
SO OFFICIAL.

10:12.182 --> 10:14.184
I MEAN, I-I KNEW YOU WERE
A DOCTOR,

10:14.184 --> 10:16.847
BUT YOU... (inhales)
ARE A DOCTOR.

10:16.847 --> 10:18.849
THANKS. SORRY, I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO CHANGE.

10:18.849 --> 10:21.922
I'M JUST--
NO, NO, NO. THE SCRUBS
ARE STRANGELY SEXY.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.624
THANKS. UM, YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A FEW THINGS TO WRAP UP.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.697
DO YOU MIND HANGING OUT
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

10:26.697 --> 10:28.699
LIKE, UH, TEN TOPS?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

10:28.699 --> 10:30.831
I'LL JUST, UH,
GRAB A SEAT HERE.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.403
HEY, STRANGER.
(elevator bell dings)

10:33.403 --> 10:35.035
HENRY. (laughs)

10:35.035 --> 10:37.738
I DIDN'T, UH, I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE,

10:37.738 --> 10:40.210
UH, YOU WERE HERE TODAY.
YEAH, THEY WANTED TO RUN
A BLOOD GLUCOSE TEST ON ME,

10:40.210 --> 10:43.013
SO THEY GAVE ME THIS NASTY
ORANGE KOOL-AID TO DRINK.

10:43.013 --> 10:45.375
IN ABOUT AN HOUR, I GOTTA
GO GIVE 'EM SOME BLOOD OR PEE.

10:45.375 --> 10:48.749
AND WE DON'T REALLY NEED
TO TALK ABOUT MY BODILY FLUIDS.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.351
SORRY TO BE RUDE. HI.
HEY.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.183
OH, SORRY. UM, YEAH.

10:53.183 --> 10:55.686
UM, WILLIAM, UH, HENRY.
HENRY, WILLIAM.

10:55.686 --> 10:59.359
ARE YOU, UH, ARE YOU
A PATIENT OF TEDDY'S?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.331
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

11:01.331 --> 11:03.293
(chuckles)

11:03.293 --> 11:05.265
ANYWAY, I, UM, I-I GOTTA GO.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.698
UH, BUT I'LL BE BACK SOON.

11:07.698 --> 11:09.069
PROMISE.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.273
ALL RIGHT, GREY,
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
OKAY, 42-YEAR-OLD MALE,

11:13.273 --> 11:14.875
UM, COMPLAINING OF
MIDSTERNAL CHEST PAIN.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.377
NO CARDIAC RISK FACTORS,
NO ANGINA.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.280
PAIN DOESN'T RADIATE.
THE E.K.G. LOOKS CLEAN.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.382
THESE ARE HIS FILMS,
AND THEY'RE MOSTLY CLEAR.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.884
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.956
DOES THE MEDIASTINUM
LOOK A LITTLE WIDE TO YOU?

11:25.956 --> 11:27.958
BECAUSE I KNOW,
SOMETIMES THAT CAN HAPPEN

11:27.958 --> 11:30.721
WITH THE PORTABLE X-RAY.
YOU GOT CARDIAC ENZYMES?

11:30.721 --> 11:32.362
(Meredith) YES.
HEY, KEPNER.

11:32.362 --> 11:34.464
YEAH.
HOW GOOD ARE YOU
AT FORGING SIGNATURES?

11:34.464 --> 11:37.067
EVEN IF I WERE GOOD AT FORGING
SIGNATURES, I WOULDN'T DO IT.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.800
IT'S UNETHICAL AND PROBABLY
ILLEGAL. SO I'M SORRY.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.472
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO FINISH
SIGNING YOUR CHARTS ON YOUR OWN.

11:42.472 --> 11:44.735
I'LL CHECK ON MR. RICHTER
RIGHT NOW. CALL RADIOLOGY.

11:44.735 --> 11:47.377
GET HIM IN FOR P.A. AND LATERAL
FILMS, AND TELL 'EM TO RUSH IT,

11:47.377 --> 11:50.340
CAUSE I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET
OUTTA HERE AND GO ON MY DATE.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.343
I MEAN, DID YOU SEE THAT GUY?
NO FORGING SIGNATURES, KAREV.
RADIOLOGY, PLEASE.

11:53.343 --> 11:55.185
FORGERY, HUH?
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

11:55.185 --> 11:57.087
WHATEVER. I JUST WANT
TO GET OUTTA HERE

11:57.087 --> 11:59.089
SO I CAN GET
TO THIS GAME TONIGHT.

11:59.089 --> 12:00.791
WAIT. YOU HAVE TICKETS?

12:00.791 --> 12:02.793
TONIGHT?
IT'S THE PAC-10 TITLE GAME.

12:02.793 --> 12:05.255
YEAH, I KNOW.
WIN THIS,
AND THE HUSKIES GET

12:05.255 --> 12:07.828
AN AUTOMATIC BID
TO MARCH MADNESS.
YEAH.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.831
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M POWERING
THROUGH ALL THESE STUPID CHARTS?

12:10.831 --> 12:13.764
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU D--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:13.764 --> 12:15.766
OF MY TEN PATIENTS
IN LABOR RIGHT NOW,

12:15.766 --> 12:17.737
NONE OF 'EM
ARE PAST 3 CENTIMETERS,

12:17.737 --> 12:19.910
WHICH MEANS,
I HAVE SOME TIME TO KILL,

12:19.910 --> 12:22.913
AND YOU CAN'T MISS THIS GAME.
HAND ME A PEN.
I THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT
I WAS A LOSER.

12:22.913 --> 12:25.245
WELL, YOU'RE
A LITTLE LESS LOSERY,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.247
NOW I KNOW YOU LIKE
COLLEGE HOOPS.

12:31.181 --> 12:33.183
HEY, WHERE'S THE KNIFE GUY?

12:33.183 --> 12:35.185
IS IT TRUE HE'S WALKING
AND TALKING?

12:35.185 --> 12:36.887
WHAT ABOUT YOUR COLECTOMY?

12:36.887 --> 12:38.188
OH, POSTPONED.

12:38.188 --> 12:40.190
THE WIFE SNUCK HIM
A CHEESEBURGER AND FRIES

12:40.190 --> 12:42.192
BEFORE SURGERY.

12:42.192 --> 12:43.894
SO THIS THING WITH CALLIE--

12:43.894 --> 12:45.866
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
IT'S A BAD IDEA, RIGHT?

12:45.866 --> 12:48.168
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
CALLIE'S BABY'S GODMOTHER.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.500
I DON'T?
NO.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.843
I MEAN, THINK OF
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE

12:52.843 --> 12:54.845
BEFORE YOU EVEN GET
TO STEP UP--

12:54.845 --> 12:57.777
MARK, CALLIE, AND ARIZONA.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.880
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.452
IT IS, YES.
A LOT OF DEAD PEOPLE.

13:02.452 --> 13:03.783
RIGHT.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.286
WHEREAS IF YOU'RE MY BABY'S
GODMOTHER-IN-WAITING,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.888
IT'S ONLY ME AND DEREK.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.890
ONE WRONG TURN
DOWN A DARK, TWISTY ROAD,

13:09.890 --> 13:12.222
BOOM, YOU'RE IN.
(elevator bell dings)

13:12.222 --> 13:14.464
OKAY, LET'S BE CLEAR.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.466
IFI AM EVER A GODPARENT
TO ANYONE'S KID,

13:16.466 --> 13:18.468
IT WILL BE IN NAME ONLY.

13:18.468 --> 13:20.470
I WILLNOTBE TAKING CARE
OF CHILDREN.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.472
THAT'S WHAT BOARDING SCHOOLS
ARE FOR.

13:22.472 --> 13:24.975
WHICH WAY TO BUTCHER BLOCK?
TRAUMA 2.

13:24.975 --> 13:27.237
(man speaks indistinctly)

13:27.237 --> 13:29.940
OKAY. I UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT
BE THIRSTY, BUT I'M SORRY.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.942
YOU CANNOT
DRINK BEER IN HERE.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.243
YOU'RE WASTING IT!

13:33.243 --> 13:35.115
OH.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.948
OLIVER,
DID YOU SEE DR. ALTMAN?

13:37.948 --> 13:39.890
YEAH, SHE'S SENDING ME OFF
FOR ANOTHER X-RAY.

13:39.890 --> 13:42.822
LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE TO
COVER ALL YOUR BASES, BUT--

13:42.822 --> 13:45.996
NO, I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
BUT I PUT A RUSH ON THE X-RAY,

13:45.996 --> 13:48.198
SO HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE QUICK,
OKAY?
YEAH.

13:48.198 --> 13:49.829
(Richard) GREY!
EXCUSE ME.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.832
I WAS FINISHING A SURGERY
JUST NOW

13:52.832 --> 13:56.867
WHEN A SCRUB NURSE ASKED ME
HOW MY WIFE WAS FEELING,

13:56.867 --> 13:59.569
BECAUSE SHE'D HEARD ADELE WAS
IN THE E.R., AND I HADN'T.

13:59.569 --> 14:01.972
NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPLAIN
TO ME WHY I FOUND OUT

14:01.972 --> 14:03.974
MY WIFE WAS A PATIENT
IN THIS HOSPITAL

14:03.974 --> 14:06.917
FROM MY SCRUB NURSE
AND NOT FROM YOU?
RICHARD, HUSH.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.950
LET MEREDITH DO HER JOB.

14:09.950 --> 14:13.223
SHE HASN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE
TO EXAMINE ME YET.
IS THAT TRUE?

14:13.223 --> 14:15.525
DON'T MIND HIM, DEAR.
HE'S JUST WORRIED ABOUT ME.

14:15.525 --> 14:17.888
HE GETS GRUFF
WHEN HE'S WORRIED.

14:17.888 --> 14:20.030
I HURT MY WRIST.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.162
I WAS TRYING TO GET OUT
THE HOLIDAY DECORATIONS

14:22.162 --> 14:24.935
AND I--OHH--I SLIPPED OFF
THE STEPLADDER.

14:24.935 --> 14:27.898
OH, IT WAS STUPID. I SHOULD'VE
WAITED FOR RICHARD TO GET HOME.

14:27.898 --> 14:30.340
HE'S SO MUCH TALLER THAN ME.

14:30.340 --> 14:33.043
I REQUESTED AN X-RAY
AND AN ORTHO CONSULT.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.505
I WILL CALL AND MAKE SURE
THAT THEY'RE COMING DOWN.

14:35.505 --> 14:37.547
(Lexie and Jackson
yell indistinctly)
(Cristina) DON'T TOUCH THAT!

14:37.547 --> 14:40.911
OOH.
I THINK I BETTER GO SEE
WHAT THAT IS.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.913
YOU BETTER.
(indistinct shouting)

14:42.913 --> 14:44.214
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

14:44.214 --> 14:45.916
YES.
(Lexie) NO!

14:45.916 --> 14:47.918
I WAS
JUST SHOWING THESE GUYS HOW,

14:47.918 --> 14:51.061
WHEN I SCRUNCH UP MY EYEBROWS,
THE KNIFE MOVES. SEE?

14:51.061 --> 14:53.293
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! STOP!
(Jackson) WHOA. DON'T DO THAT!

14:53.293 --> 14:55.425
STOP MOVING THE KNIFE!
OKAY, OKAY.

14:55.425 --> 14:58.128
YOU GUYS SHOULDA SEEN
THE BRAWL.

14:58.128 --> 15:00.931
STEW-BALL KICKED
THAT OTHER GUY'S ASS!
YEAH!

15:00.931 --> 15:03.003
OKAY, AND NOW STEW-BALL HAS
A KNIFE IN HIS HEAD.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.635
OH.
OKAY, LET'S FOCUS. STEWART,
HOW MUCH IS 14 PLUS 4?

15:05.635 --> 15:08.338
18.
27 MINUS 13.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.981
15?

15:10.981 --> 15:13.513
NO. 172 MINUS 60.
OH.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.946
I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT IT'S NOT
BECAUSE OF THE KNIFE.

15:15.946 --> 15:19.449
IT'S JUST 'CAUSE I'M SO DRUNK.
NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S JUST 'CAUSE HE'S DUMB.

15:19.449 --> 15:21.321
(laughs)
THANKS, DAVID. REALLY?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.954
(Cristina) UNBELIEVABLE.
HIS MENTAL STATUS

15:23.954 --> 15:26.656
IS COMPLETELY INTACT, IF YOU
DON'T COUNT FOR HIS MATH SKILLS.

15:26.656 --> 15:29.359
IT'S LIKE THE KNIFE
DID NO DAMAGE AT ALL.
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST PULL THE THING OUT?

15:29.359 --> 15:32.002
'CAUSE WE GOT A GAMES
TO GETS TO!

15:32.002 --> 15:34.164
I'LL DRINKS TO THAT!
WHOO!

15:34.164 --> 15:36.166
NO! NO BEER!

15:36.166 --> 15:38.568
BUZZKILL.
UH-OH!

15:38.568 --> 15:40.010
(Jackson) NO!
HEY!

15:40.010 --> 15:41.641
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE?

15:41.641 --> 15:43.243
(sighs)

15:43.243 --> 15:45.245
OKAY.
OLIVER'S IN X-RAY,

15:45.245 --> 15:47.247
STEWART IS STABLE
AND WAITING FOR DEREK,

15:47.247 --> 15:49.379
WHO SHOULD BE HERE SOON,

15:49.379 --> 15:51.081
ADELE IS WAITING ON ORTHO,

15:51.081 --> 15:53.483
AND, UH, CAN I GET
THE DISCHARGES

15:53.483 --> 15:55.655
FROM THE LAST HOUR, PLEASE?
SURE.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.228
OH, AND, UH, THE BOY IN BED
SEVEN WITH THE BROKEN LEG,

15:58.228 --> 15:59.990
NATHAN ENGLUNDAR--
LET'S CHECK ON THE STATUS

15:59.990 --> 16:02.062
OF THE O.R. FOR HIM, PLEASE.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.693
(indistinct conversations)

16:03.693 --> 16:05.695
IS THIS LEXIE'S PATIENT
WITH THE HEADACHE?

16:05.695 --> 16:07.367
YEAH.
MITCH TURNER?

16:07.367 --> 16:10.100
MM-HMM.
HOW LONG AGO
WAS HE DISCHARGED?

16:10.100 --> 16:13.073
NOT LONG. A FEW MINUTES AGO.
DID HE LEAVE?
DID HE ALREADY LEAVE?

16:15.105 --> 16:16.606
(clicking door handle)

16:16.606 --> 16:18.108
(siren whoops)

16:18.108 --> 16:20.080
MR. TURNER!

16:20.080 --> 16:23.083
MR. TURNER, I NEED YOU
TO TRY TO SMILE FOR ME, PLEASE.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.315
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

16:25.315 --> 16:27.487
I NEED YOU TO TRY
TO SMILE FOR ME, PLEASE.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.620
OKAY, CAN YOU LIFT YOUR ARMS
ABOVE YOUR HEAD LIKE THIS?

16:30.620 --> 16:34.024
DR. GREY,
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
NO, IT'S NOT.

16:34.024 --> 16:37.127
WE GOT A CODE C.V.A. LET'S GET
A STRETCHER OUT HERE, STAT.

16:37.127 --> 16:40.300
CAN YOU REPEAT AFTER ME?
THE DOG CHASED AFTER THE CAT.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.473
THE--THE DOG CH-CHASED AF--

16:43.473 --> 16:45.535
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM?
THE--THE DOG--

16:45.535 --> 16:48.178
OKAY, I NEED YOU TO HELP ME.
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM?!

16:48.178 --> 16:50.610
WE NEED
TO GET HIM ON THE GROUND.
THE DOG CH--

16:50.610 --> 16:53.283
OKAY, GET YOUR PURSE UNDER
HIS HEAD. QUICKLY, PLEASE.
THE DOG CH--OH.

16:53.283 --> 16:56.116
OKAY.
AND HELP ME SECURE HIS ARM.
HOLD IT LIKE THIS.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.449
O-O-OKAY,
BUT WH-WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
BECAUSE HE'S HAVING A STROKE.

16:59.449 --> 17:03.153
(siren wails)

17:11.431 --> 17:13.433
UNSTEADY GAIT, SLURRED SPEECH,
ASYMMETRIC SMILE.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.435
HIS SYMPTOMS STARTED
NO MORE THAN 20 MINUTES AGO,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.637
SO WE SHOULD BE WELL WITHIN
THE GOLDEN HOUR.
OKAY.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.639
I KNOW--A STROKE,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.641
I MEAN, WHAT IF
HE HAD BEEN DRIVING ME

17:21.641 --> 17:24.174
IN THE CAR WHEN IT HAPPENED?

17:24.174 --> 17:27.177
OH, WAIT. HANG ON.
HERE'S THE DOCTOR.
HI. SO THE STROKE TEAM
HAS TAKEN HIM UP TO C.T.

17:27.177 --> 17:29.719
WE'RE GONNA SEE IF HE'S ELIGIBLE
FOR THE CLOT-BUSTING MEDICINE.

17:29.719 --> 17:32.722
WE CAUGHT THE STROKE EARLY,
WHICH IS VERY GOOD.
(sighs) SO--SO ON A SCALE
OF 1 TO 10,

17:32.722 --> 17:35.725
10 BEING I MIGHT HAVE TO CANCEL
OUR ASPEN TRIP IN A WEEK,

17:35.725 --> 17:37.727
HOW IS HE?

17:37.727 --> 17:39.729
YOU SHOULD CANCEL THE TRIP.

17:39.729 --> 17:43.062
(sighs)
YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.064
LOOKS LIKE THE BLADE LANDED
IN THE MAXILLARY SINUS.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.137
CHANCES ARE, THE KNIFE ITSELF

17:47.137 --> 17:49.299
IS TAMPONADING
ANY MAJOR BLEEDING.

17:49.299 --> 17:52.642
PROBABLY BEST JUST TO GO AHEAD
AND OPEN UP THE CRANIUM.
(Jackson) OR WE COULD
JUST TAKE HIM TO THE O.R.

17:52.642 --> 17:56.176
AND PULL THIS THING OUT.
REALLY,AVERY?
JUST PULL IT OUT?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.648
LET ME GUESS. YOU WANT
TO GET OUT OF HERE EARLY

17:58.648 --> 18:01.711
TO GO TO THE GAME,
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
(Lexie)
OR SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE

18:01.711 --> 18:04.154
THE BLADE DIDN'T HIT
ANY MAJOR ARTERIES OR VEINS,

18:04.154 --> 18:07.417
HE KNOWS THAT A CONTROLLED
EXTRACTION WOULD BE BOTH SAFER

18:07.417 --> 18:09.819
AND LESS INVASIVE
THAN A COMPLETE CRANIOTOMY.
IS THAT TRUE, AVERY?

18:09.819 --> 18:12.692
IS THAT WHY YOU SUGGESTED
WE PULL IT OUT OF HIS HEAD?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.665
YEAH. AND I WANT TO GET OUTTA
HERE EARLY TO GET TO THE GAME.

18:15.665 --> 18:19.098
ME, TOO. I'M GOOD WITH THAT.
LET'S JUST DO WHAT HE SAID.
YEAH!

18:19.098 --> 18:23.403
LEXIE,
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.405
THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME
OUT OF THAT ROOM.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.738
I SWEAR, IT TAKES EVERYTHING
JUST TO BE CIVIL TO MARK LATELY.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.541
SUCH AN ASS. WHAT'S UP?
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK CLOSELY.

18:31.541 --> 18:34.214
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
UH...

18:34.214 --> 18:36.746
THIS IS THE PATIENT'S ADMITTING
SIGNATURE WHEN HE CAME IN.

18:36.746 --> 18:40.750
AND THIS IS HIS SIGNATURE
WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED.
OH, NO.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.293
MITCH TURNER, THE PATIENT
YOU JUST DISCHARGED,

18:43.293 --> 18:46.296
IS UP IN RADIOLOGY
BEING TREATED FOR A STROKE.
OH, GOD.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.398
I KNOW YOU KNOW
THE SIGNS OF A STROKE.

18:48.398 --> 18:51.201
HOW DID YOU MISS THIS? ARE YOU
DISTRACTED BY THE MARK THING?

18:51.201 --> 18:54.704
IS THAT IT?
NO, I CHECKED THE C.T. HE WAS
HAVING A CLASSIC MIGRAINE.

18:54.704 --> 18:56.706
HE'S HAD THEM BEFORE.
THERE'S NO WAY

18:56.706 --> 18:59.369
THAT HE WAS HAVING A STROKE
WHEN I TREATED HIM.
LEXIE, I KNOW YOU KNOW,

18:59.369 --> 19:02.242
THIS KIND OF HEADACHE CAN BE
A PRECURSOR TO A STROKE.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.174
WHEN YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
AN ORTHO CONSULT,

19:04.174 --> 19:06.616
YOU COULDA MENTIONED IT WAS
THE CHIEF'S WIFE, GREY.

19:06.616 --> 19:09.349
I WOULD'VE BEEN DOWN HERE
A HELL OF A LOT SOONER.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.221
(sighs)

19:11.221 --> 19:14.224
NO--
I AM SO SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, MRS. WEBBER.

19:14.224 --> 19:16.356
YOU HURT YOUR WRIST IN A FALL?
OH, IT WAS SO SILLY.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.329
I'D JUST GOTTEN HOME, AND I WAS
TRYING TO GET SOME--OHH!

19:19.329 --> 19:22.161
REACH SOMETHING
ON THE TOP SHELF MYSELF.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.266
I-I JUST LANDED WRONG.
HER WRIST ABSORBED
ALL THE IMPACT.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.339
YEAH, IT LOOKS PAINFUL. WE'LL
GET YOU SOME MORE PAIN MEDS TO

19:29.339 --> 19:31.341
HELP YOU OUT WITH THAT. UH, YOUR
X-RAY SHOWS A HAIRLINE FRACTURE.

19:31.341 --> 19:33.903
OH.
SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A LOT WORSE.

19:33.903 --> 19:37.347
WE'LL SPLINT YOU UP AND GET YOU
OUT OF HERE IN NO TIME, OKAY?

19:37.347 --> 19:38.648
(pager beeps)

19:38.648 --> 19:41.411
YOU HAVE ME PAGED
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, OKAY?

19:41.411 --> 19:43.553
OKAY. MM.

19:43.553 --> 19:46.586

over p.a.)

19:46.586 --> 19:48.488
MM.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.721
THANK YOU FOR COVERING FOR ME
BEFORE WITH THE CHIEF.

19:51.721 --> 19:54.394
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
EXCUSE ME?

19:54.394 --> 19:58.828
WHEN YOU SAID I HADN'T BEEN BY
TO EXAMINE YOU YET.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.702
SO YOU SAID THAT

20:02.702 --> 20:05.275
YOU FELL WHEN YOU GOT HOME...

20:05.275 --> 20:07.437
FROM WORK.

20:07.437 --> 20:10.710
YES. YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
DO YOU REMEMBER HITTING
YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU FELL?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.282
NOT THAT I RECALL.

20:12.282 --> 20:15.615
DR. GREY, I HAVE THE NEW X-RAYS
FOR OLIVER RICHTER.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.548
OKAY. LET'S GET MRS. WEBBER
A HEAD C.T.
OKAY.

20:18.548 --> 20:19.849
OKAY?

20:21.421 --> 20:24.254
(whispers) OH, DAMN IT.

20:24.254 --> 20:27.297
(normal voice) EXCUSE ME.

20:27.297 --> 20:29.629
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

20:29.629 --> 20:31.331
HEY.
HEY.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.304
SORRY TO MAKE YOU WAIT.
NO, NO PROBLEM. UM, REALLY.

20:34.304 --> 20:36.436
HENRY HERE
HAS BEEN KEEPING ME COMPANY.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.768
ALTHOUGH HE'S PROBABLY
SICK OF ME BY NOW.

20:38.768 --> 20:42.241
I'VE BEEN GRILLING HIM
ABOUT THE MAJOR LEAGUES.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.244
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
HE USED TO PLAY PRO BALL.
OH... (chuckles)
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DID.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, REALLY.
ALTHOUGH THERE IS

20:47.246 --> 20:49.349
A BASEBALL CARD OUT THERE
WITH MY FACE ON IT SOMEWHERE.
(laughs)

20:49.349 --> 20:52.282
LOOK, I DON'T MEAN
TO HOLD YOU GUYS UP.

20:52.282 --> 20:54.284
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A-A RESERVATION WAITING.

20:54.284 --> 20:56.286
EXCUSE ME, DR. ALTMAN.
MR. RICHTER--

20:56.286 --> 20:59.289
MEDIASTINUM LOOKS BORDERLINE
ON THE P.A. FILMS. TAKE A LOOK.

21:00.590 --> 21:03.933
OKAY, UM... (sighs)
THAT RESERVATION

21:03.933 --> 21:06.566
MAY HAVE TO WAIT
JUST A-A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.369
I'M SORRY. I MEAN, IF YOU WANT
TO RESCHEDULE, I TOTALLY--

21:09.369 --> 21:11.341
NO. NONSENSE.
I'M--I'M HAPPY TO WAIT.

21:11.341 --> 21:13.272
YOU ARE SAVING LIVES.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.705
LEAST I CAN DO IS TAKE YOU OUT
TO DINNER WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

21:15.705 --> 21:17.677
THANK YOU.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.850
DID YOU--YOU EVER PITCH
AGAINST JEFF BAGWELL?

21:20.850 --> 21:22.582
ONCE,

21:22.582 --> 21:24.283
AND IT WASN'T PRETTY.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.285
YOU WERE RIGHT.
GET A C.T. TO BE SAFE,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.588
AND I'LL STICK AROUND
TO LOOK AT THE RESULTS.
(laughter)

21:28.588 --> 21:30.590
AT LEAST SOMEBODY'S HAVING
A GOOD NIGHT.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.322

21:40.830 --> 21:42.332

21:42.332 --> 21:44.734
GOOD NEWS?

21:44.734 --> 21:46.406
OR NOT SUCH GOOD NEWS?

21:46.406 --> 21:48.708
OLIVER, YOUR SECOND X-RAY
IS STILL CONCERNING.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.541
DR. ALTMAN AND I AGREE
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A C.T.,

21:51.541 --> 21:54.484
JUST TO RULE OUT
ANYTHING SERIOUS.
AND HOW--HOW LONG
WILL THAT TAKE?

21:54.484 --> 21:57.717
("Charge!" ringtone playing)
OH, THAT'S MY SON CALLING.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.720
HE'S WORRIED WE'LL MISS TIP-OFF.
WHAT SHOULD I TELL HIM?

22:00.720 --> 22:03.793
DO I NEED TO TELL HIM
WE'RE GONNA MISS THIS GAME?
I WISH
I HAD AN ANSWER FOR YOU,

22:03.793 --> 22:06.596
BUT I THINK IT'S A SAFE BET
YOU'LL BE LATE.
(game clock buzzer sounds)

22:06.596 --> 22:08.458
(cell phone beeps)

22:08.458 --> 22:10.760
MAX. HEY, BUDDY.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.602

22:12.602 --> 22:14.464
OH, DADDY WILL BE FINE.

22:14.464 --> 22:15.865
DON'T YOU WORRY. DON'T WORRY.

22:15.865 --> 22:18.868
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT ALL THAT
POPCORN WE'RE GONNA BE EATING.

22:18.868 --> 22:20.870
MAKE SURE HE'S ON
BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS.

22:20.870 --> 22:22.372
YOU BOOKED AN O.R.?

22:22.372 --> 22:25.615
WOW. IT DIDN'T HIT
ANY BRAIN MATTER AT ALL?

22:25.615 --> 22:28.418
(Lexie) DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT
FROM THIS.
HOW LONG TILL SHEPHERD GETS
DOWN HERE TO TAKE A LOOK?

22:28.418 --> 22:30.450
HE SHOULD BE OUT OF SURGERY
ANY MINUTE.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.452
GOOD. LONGER THAT THING
STAYS IN THERE,

22:32.452 --> 22:34.454

22:44.464 --> 22:47.537

22:47.537 --> 22:51.471

23:00.980 --> 23:04.614
(Owen) HOW IS HE, GREY?
PUPILS ARE EQUAL AND REACTIVE.
HE'S ALERT AND AWAKE.

23:04.614 --> 23:06.916
CAN I GET SOME MORE GAUZE
FOR THIS WOUND, PLEASE?
YEAH.

23:06.916 --> 23:08.888
(Jackson) REFLEXES SEEM NORMAL.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.389
(scoffs) GIVE ME THAT.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.992
I'M FINE. IT'S JUST
A LITTLE HEADACHE IS ALL.

23:12.992 --> 23:16.426
I'VE HAD HANGOVERS
WORSE THAN THIS.
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S THE STATUS
ON THE BLADE?

23:16.426 --> 23:19.168
WELL, ABOUT THAT--
YEAH,
THERE IS NO BLADE ANYMORE.

23:19.168 --> 23:20.830
WHAT, UH, WHAT HAPPENED?

23:20.830 --> 23:23.773
SIR, JUST LAY BACK AND LET ME
EXAMINE YOU, OKAY?
(Nathan crying)

23:23.773 --> 23:27.176
COULD WE JUST GET
A DOCTOR, PLEASE?

23:27.176 --> 23:30.440
(Derek) I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THE C.T.s.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.443

IT'S OKAY, BUD. IT'S OKAY.

23:33.443 --> 23:35.414
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, NATHAN.
MOMMY, HELP ME.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.417

OKAY, I'M GONNA WRITE AN ORDER
FOR MORE PAIN MEDS.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.791

IT'S OKAY, MONKEY.
I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO HOME.

A LITTLE WHILE LONGER, OKAY?

23:44.524 --> 23:47.527

IT WILL JUST BE
A LITTLE LONGER, RIGHT?

23:47.527 --> 23:50.760

FOR NATHAN?
I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET.

24:03.112 --> 24:05.114
WELL, THE BLADE WENT THROUGH
HIS SKULL, DIDN'T HIT

24:05.114 --> 24:08.077
ANY MAJOR NERVES OR ARTERIES,
SO HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
FLESH WOUND?

24:08.077 --> 24:10.079
YEAH.
I MEAN,
THAT'S THE LUCKIEST GUY ALIVE.

I'M SWAMPED. I CAN'T LEAVE.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.788

ANOTHER ONE WAITING FOR AN O.R.
WELL, YOUR PATIENT'S C.T.

26:16.806 --> 26:19.679
EXCUSE ME. (clears throat)

26:19.679 --> 26:22.882
♪ OH ♪

26:22.882 --> 26:26.185
♪ YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OOH ♪

26:26.185 --> 26:28.187
JUST ADMIT IT.
YOU LIKE HER.
SHUT UP.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.189
GOD, I DON'T THINK
YOU DO UNDERSTAND, ACTUALLY.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.191
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON
SINCE YESTERDAY.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.764
WE TOOK OUR SON
TO AN AFTER-HOURS CLINIC

26:34.764 --> 26:37.627
WHERE HE WAS MISDIAGNOSED,
AND THEN HE WAS SENT HOME

26:37.627 --> 26:40.369
WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A PAINKILLER,
AND HE WAS UP ALL NIGHT CRYING.

26:40.369 --> 26:43.032
AND THEN THIS MORNING,
OUR PEDIATRICIAN SENT US HERE.

26:43.032 --> 26:45.374
AND NOW WE'VE BEEN
WAITING AROUND ALL DAY...

26:45.374 --> 26:47.677
(crying)
WITH OUR 4 YEAR OLD SON.

26:47.677 --> 26:50.680
BELIEVE ME. I UNDERSTAND
THAT A KID WITH A BROKEN LEG

26:50.680 --> 26:53.683
DOESN'T TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER
A GUY WITH A KNIFE IN HIS HEAD,

26:53.683 --> 26:55.985
BUT MY SON IS SCARED
AND HE IS IN PAIN,

26:55.985 --> 26:58.688
SO COULD SOMEBODY PLEASE
JUST GET TO HIS LEG ALREADY?

26:58.688 --> 27:00.349
PLEASE.
YES, SIR.

27:00.349 --> 27:02.822
YOU STILL HAVEN'T HELPED
THAT KID YET?

27:02.822 --> 27:06.856
HE'S 4 WITH A FEMUR FRACTURE.
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT HURTS?
NO, I KNOW. IT'S JUST BEEN
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

27:06.856 --> 27:09.729
TYLER, ISN'T THAT O.R.
READY YET?
THEY'RE PREPPING IT NOW.

27:09.729 --> 27:12.802
GREY, MY WIFE WAS CLEARED
BY DR. TORRES.

27:12.802 --> 27:16.235
YOU ORDERED A HEAD C.T.
FOR A BROKEN WRIST?
YEAH, I CAN EXPLAIN THAT SIR.
I HAVE SOME CONCERNS--

27:16.235 --> 27:18.637
DR. GREY,
THEY'RE CALLING FROM C.T.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.710
YOUR PATIENT'S CODING
IN THE SCANNER.
WHAT?

27:20.710 --> 27:23.142
THEY SAY HE'S CODING.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.645
(siren wailing)

27:32.081 --> 27:34.323
(monitor beeping erratically)

27:34.323 --> 27:36.325
(pants) HOLD C.P.R.

27:36.325 --> 27:37.987
(monitor beeps)

27:37.987 --> 27:40.159
V-FIB.
PAGE ALTMAN.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.692
GIVE ME THE PADDLES NOW.
CHARGE TO 200.

27:42.692 --> 27:44.363
(defibrillator whines)
CLEAR.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.795
(paddles thunk)

27:55.004 --> 27:56.846
CHARGE TO 300.
(defibrillator whines)

27:56.846 --> 27:59.849
CLEAR.
(paddles thunk)

27:59.849 --> 28:01.350
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
GOT A PULSE.

28:01.350 --> 28:03.252
(Meredith) YES!
Scans are up.

28:03.252 --> 28:06.255
GREY, TALK TO ME.
UH, HE WAS CODING
WHEN I GOT HERE.

28:06.255 --> 28:08.217
I DEFIBRILLATED HIM
THREE TIMES.

28:08.217 --> 28:10.790
I GAVE HIM THREE ROUNDS OF EPI,
TWO OF ATROPINE.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.222
I LOADED HIM UP WITH AMIODARONE,
BUT HE'S TACHYCARDIC NOW.

28:13.222 --> 28:15.725
I MEAN,
HE'S BARELY HANGING ON.
HE NEEDS SURGERY.
BOOK AN O.R.

28:15.725 --> 28:18.798
OKAY. I'LL GET A ROOM
PREPPED AND READY.
NO TIME.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.731
HIS AORTA'S DISSECTING
AS WE SPEAK.

28:21.731 --> 28:24.473
HE NEEDS SURGERY
RIGHT NOW.
THEY'RE SAYING
ALL THE O.R.s ARE BOOKED.

28:24.473 --> 28:26.475
WELL, TELL 'EM TO BUMP SOMEONE,

28:26.475 --> 28:28.978
'CAUSE WE'RE COME UP
EITHER WAY.
I HAVE AN O.R.

28:28.978 --> 28:31.941
TELL 'EM TO BUMP MINE AND PREP
IT FOR AN EMERGENCY CARDIO.

28:31.941 --> 28:34.143
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.
GOT IT. GO.

28:34.143 --> 28:37.246
ALL RIGHT. LET'S CLEAR IT.

28:37.246 --> 28:40.089
(elevator bell dings)

28:40.089 --> 28:42.992
LET'S HOLD THAT ELEVATOR!

28:53.232 --> 28:55.464
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON.

28:55.464 --> 28:58.868
ONCE THESE DOORS OPEN,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

28:58.868 --> 29:02.041
GET HIM IN THE O.R. AND OPEN HIM
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
I KNOW.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.744
EVEN THEN,
IF THAT AORTA TEARS,

29:05.744 --> 29:07.877
WE MAY ALREADY BE TOO LATE.

29:09.478 --> 29:11.750
AND WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE TIME TO SCRUB.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.224
I KNOW. I KNOW.

29:15.224 --> 29:17.486
THANKS.

29:27.837 --> 29:30.469
(elevator bell dings)

29:33.242 --> 29:37.106
(Teddy) JUST POUR THE BETADINE
STRAIGHT ON TO THE CHEST.

29:37.106 --> 29:41.280
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PRETTY.
WE NEED TO GET IN THERE.

29:41.280 --> 29:45.855
(indistinct conversations)

29:48.417 --> 29:50.059
ALL RIGHT. PLUG ME IN.

29:50.059 --> 29:53.362
(indistinct conversations
continue)

29:55.925 --> 29:57.096
SCALPEL.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.528
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

29:59.528 --> 30:01.831
(Meredith) CAUTERY.
HERE.

30:05.434 --> 30:08.477
CAUTERIZING NOW.
GET IN THERE QUICKLY, GREY.

30:08.477 --> 30:11.841
TIME IS MYOCARDIUM.

30:11.841 --> 30:13.943
ALL RIGHT. SAW.

30:13.943 --> 30:16.215
(buzzes)
GET THAT RETRACTOR READY.

30:16.215 --> 30:20.049
(buzzing)
THIS GUY THOUGHT HE HAD
A BAD CASE OF HEARTBURN.

30:20.049 --> 30:22.992
HE WENT FROM THAT TO THIS
IN LESS THAN 45 MINUTES.

30:22.992 --> 30:25.094
THAT'S HOW THESE WORK.
HOW'S HIS PRESSURE?

30:25.094 --> 30:26.825
70s AND DROPPING.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.598
(buzzing stops)
RETRACTOR.

30:29.598 --> 30:33.462
EVERY BEAT OF HIS HEART RIPS
THIS TEAR A LITTLE BIT WIDER.

30:33.462 --> 30:36.165
ALL RIGHT.
HOW MANY
OF THESE RUPTURED DISSECTIONS

30:36.165 --> 30:39.168
HAVE YOU CAUGHT IN TIME
TO OPERATE?
40. MAYBE 50.

30:39.168 --> 30:42.411
HOW MANY HAVE YOU
BEEN ABLE TO SAVE?
THREE.

30:42.411 --> 30:45.074
(suction gurgling)

30:45.074 --> 30:48.517
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:48.517 --> 30:50.419
ALL RIGHT. I'M IN.

30:50.419 --> 30:53.182
(monitor beeping erratically)

30:53.182 --> 30:56.255
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.
DAMN IT. HE'S BLEEDING OUT.

30:56.255 --> 30:59.628
HIS AORTA IS WIDE OPEN.
ALL RIGHT, CLAMP.

30:59.628 --> 31:01.630
COME ON! COME ON!
COME ON!
HERE.

31:01.630 --> 31:04.593
ALL RIGHT, GREY.
LET'S TRY SUCKER BYPASS.

31:04.593 --> 31:06.435
(nurses speak indistinctly)

31:06.435 --> 31:07.596
CANNULAS.

31:07.596 --> 31:09.868
(beeping continues)

31:09.868 --> 31:12.501
(suction gurgling)

31:12.501 --> 31:15.044
IT'S NOT WORKING.
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLOOD.

31:15.044 --> 31:17.046
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
ONCE WE GET HIM ON BYPASS,

31:17.046 --> 31:19.408
IT'LL BE EASIER TO CONTROL.
(alarm beeping)

31:19.408 --> 31:21.951
HEART'S FIBRILLATING.

31:21.951 --> 31:24.413
ALL RIGHT. CARDIAC MASSAGE.

31:24.413 --> 31:26.055
PADDLES.

31:26.055 --> 31:29.188
I'VE ALMOST GOT HIM
CANNULATED.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.261
(defibrillator whines)
CHARGE TO 10. CLEAR.

31:32.261 --> 31:33.622
(beeps)

31:33.622 --> 31:35.424
(paddles thunk)

31:35.424 --> 31:37.927
(monitor beeping erratically)

31:37.927 --> 31:40.629
DAMN IT.
HE'S BLEEDING
OUT OF HIS NOSE AND EARS.

31:40.629 --> 31:42.901
I'VE BEEN LOADING HIM UP WITH
BLOOD, F.F.P. AND FACTOR VII,

31:42.901 --> 31:45.074
BUT I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE LOSSES.

31:45.074 --> 31:48.437
FOLEY'S
FULL OF BLOOD, TOO.
HE'S D.I.C.
HIS CANNULA SITES ARE OOZING.

31:48.437 --> 31:51.410
LET'S PUSH 3 OF EPI.
SET ME UP FOR ANOTHER SHOCK.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.013
(beeping continues)

31:54.013 --> 31:55.414
(defibrillator whines)

31:55.414 --> 31:57.016
CLEAR.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.917
(beeps and thunks)

31:58.917 --> 32:00.950
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

32:00.950 --> 32:03.622
DAMN IT.
WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO?
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO?

32:03.622 --> 32:05.654
THERE'S NOTHING.
HIS AORTA IS IN SHREDS.

32:05.654 --> 32:08.627
WELL, WHAT ABOUT--
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO DO.
CALL IT.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.359
(tone continues)

32:10.359 --> 32:12.231
CALL IT, GREY.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.233
NO, I MEAN, WE--
GREY, WE GOT HERE TOO LATE.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.235
THESE ARE
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.937
THERE IS NOTHING
THAT WE CAN DO. I'M SORRY.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.639
WE NEED TO CALL IT.

32:20.639 --> 32:24.974
(tone continues)

32:33.052 --> 32:36.055
(tone continues)

32:39.128 --> 32:41.430
TIME OF DEATH--
1852.

32:41.430 --> 32:43.662
(tone continues)

32:52.041 --> 32:55.274
(baby crying)

32:58.547 --> 33:00.749
(continues crying)

33:00.749 --> 33:04.083
(babies crying)

33:04.083 --> 33:07.986
(babbling)

33:09.318 --> 33:13.492
HEY. I HEARD
YOU LOST A PATIENT.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.265
(sighs deeply)

33:16.265 --> 33:19.268
(fussing)

33:22.601 --> 33:26.035
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T WANT TO SHARE YOU.

33:26.035 --> 33:28.037
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO SHARE YOU,

33:28.037 --> 33:31.040
BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE

33:31.040 --> 33:32.711
CALLIE'S BABY'S GODMOTHER.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.114
OH. OKAY.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.415
(baby fusses)

33:36.415 --> 33:38.417
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE,
IF YOU AGREE TO BE

33:38.417 --> 33:40.089
CALLIE'S BABY'S GODMOTHER,

33:40.089 --> 33:44.022
YOU'RE SAYING THAT I'LL NEVER
HAVE A BABY OF MY OWN.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.694
MEREDITH, YOU KNOW, I--

33:45.694 --> 33:47.696
I'M IN NO WAY SAYING
ANYTHING THAT--THAT--

33:47.696 --> 33:51.700
I KNOW.
IT JUST FEELS THAT WAY.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.162
OKAY.

33:53.162 --> 33:56.105
(sighs)

33:56.105 --> 33:57.606
(whispers) OKAY.

33:57.606 --> 34:01.440
(baby crying)

34:05.814 --> 34:09.318
WELL, I, UH...
(blows air)

34:09.318 --> 34:12.181
HAVE TO GO HAVE A REALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION

34:12.181 --> 34:14.183
WITH CALLIE NOW.

34:15.454 --> 34:19.488
HOW ABOUT YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
(babbles)

34:19.488 --> 34:23.262
OH, I HAVE TO GO CONTACT
OLIVER'S FAMILY.

34:26.135 --> 34:29.268
OH, HEY, HEY, HEY, WAIT.
YOU GOT, UH...

34:29.268 --> 34:31.740
BLOOD OR SOMETHING.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.205
THANK YOU.

34:36.205 --> 34:38.377
YOU'RE WELCOME.

34:42.151 --> 34:44.853
(people speaking indistinctly)

34:44.853 --> 34:46.355
HEY, CHIEF.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.689
ABOUT EARLIER--
IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.691
I CHECKED
ADELE'S HEAD C.T. MYSELF.

34:52.691 --> 34:55.224
IT WAS CLEAN.
HER WRIST IS IN A SPLINT.

34:55.224 --> 34:57.596
AND I'M TAKING HER HOME NOW.
WELL, I STILL HAVE
SOME CONCERNS.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.599
AND IF HER C.T. WAS CLEAN,
THEN I HAVE EVEN MORE CONCERNS.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.101
THANK YOU, MEREDITH, BUT I
ASSURE YOU, ADELE IS FINE.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.103
CHIEF, SHE'S BEEN
GETTING THINGS VERY CONFUSED.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.877
MEREDITH, SHE IS FINE, AND I'M
TAKING HER HOME RIGHT NOW.

35:08.877 --> 35:11.680
WHY WAS SHE GETTING CHRISTMAS
DECORATIONS DOWN IN FEBRUARY?

35:11.680 --> 35:15.284
GOOD NIGHT, MEREDITH.
AND SHE SAID SHE HAD
JUST GOTTEN HOME FROM WORK.

35:15.284 --> 35:16.785
DIDN'T SHE RETIRE?
MEREDITH--

35:16.785 --> 35:18.687
CHIEF, SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT.
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

35:18.687 --> 35:21.290
NOW I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.

35:21.290 --> 35:23.252
AND WHILE I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN, THAT'S ENOUGH.

35:23.252 --> 35:26.295
ADELE HAD A SCARE TODAY.
SHE HAD A FALL.

35:26.295 --> 35:28.297
ANY NUMBER OF THINGS
COULD ACCOUNT

35:28.297 --> 35:30.299
FOR HER MIXING UP
A COUPLE OF DETAILS,

35:30.299 --> 35:32.861
NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS HER
BEING INTERROGATED BY YOU.

35:32.861 --> 35:35.364
NOW IF SOMETHING BIGGER
WERE WRONG WITH MY WIFE,

35:35.364 --> 35:37.366
I WOULD KNOW IT.

35:37.366 --> 35:39.608
YOU'VE GOT ALZHEIMER'S
ON THE BRAIN.

35:39.608 --> 35:41.610
I MEAN, YOU--YOU BUY A CAR

35:41.610 --> 35:44.573
AND YOU START SEEING IT
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK.

35:44.573 --> 35:47.416
NOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL 24/7.

35:47.416 --> 35:48.917
I GET IT.

35:48.917 --> 35:51.250
BUT ADELE
IS NOT YOUR MOTHER, MEREDITH.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.921
SHE'S MY WIFE.

35:55.284 --> 35:59.328
NOW GOOD NIGHT.

35:59.328 --> 36:02.491
(door opens)

36:02.491 --> 36:05.494
(door closes)

36:05.494 --> 36:09.338
(indistinct conversations)

36:09.338 --> 36:11.169
HI. I'M SO SORRY.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.172
I GOT PULLED
INTO AN EMERGENCY SURGERY.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.844
WHERE IS NATHAN?

36:15.844 --> 36:18.547
ACTUALLY, A-A DOCTOR CAME BY
TO GET HIM A LITTLE BIT AGO.

36:18.547 --> 36:21.380
HE'S GETTING HIS CASTS
PUT ON RIGHT NOW.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.383
GREAT. THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.415
(exhales deeply)

36:26.415 --> 36:29.588
DR. GREY, WE HAVE
A SURGICAL ABDOMEN IN BED THREE.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.890
OKAY, LET'S JUST GET
OLIVER RICHTER'S CHART.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.492
OKAY.

36:33.492 --> 36:36.365
("Charge!" ringtone plays)

36:36.365 --> 36:38.327
(scoreboard buzzer sounds)

36:38.327 --> 36:40.399
("Charge!" ringtone plays)

36:40.399 --> 36:42.471
(scoreboard buzzer sounds)

36:42.471 --> 36:44.803
(exhales)

36:44.803 --> 36:46.305
("Charge!" ringtone plays)

36:46.305 --> 36:47.806
(inhales deeply)

36:47.806 --> 36:49.308
(exhales)

36:49.308 --> 36:50.639
(beep)

36:50.639 --> 36:52.781
(inhales)

36:52.781 --> 36:54.783
HELLO.

36:56.785 --> 37:00.289
(voice breaking) HI, MAX.

37:00.289 --> 37:04.493
THIS IS--
NO, IT'S YOUR DADDY'S DOCTOR.

37:04.493 --> 37:08.257
IS YOUR MOM AROUND?

37:08.257 --> 37:11.430
AN HOUR...

37:11.430 --> 37:14.363
ONE HOUR...

37:14.363 --> 37:18.507
CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING...

37:18.507 --> 37:20.238
(speaking inaudibly)
