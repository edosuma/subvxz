01:58.600 --> 02:00.768
I'll get the breakfast
special, all right?

02:00.802 --> 02:02.236
You got it.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.438
- What'll it be?
- The usual.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.673
Corned beef hash and eggs.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.908
More coffee with that?

02:08.943 --> 02:10.744
Oh sure.
Thank you.

02:10.777 --> 02:12.713
<i>Hey, good to see you.</i>

02:26.560 --> 02:28.495
All right, thanks.

02:28.529 --> 02:30.797
You're a credit to the force.

02:34.735 --> 02:37.537
Your leg again?

02:37.571 --> 02:39.539
I should've let them
cut it off.

02:39.573 --> 02:41.541
Well, this'll make you
feel better:

02:41.575 --> 02:43.810
That was my cop.
Your pal Liam...

02:43.844 --> 02:46.946
the mug who slashed
Pearl......

02:46.980 --> 02:50.116
... Apparently he takes his meals
at a joint on the north side.

03:00.995 --> 03:03.729
I'm warning you.

03:03.764 --> 03:06.631
<i>Don't come near me,
God damn it.</i>

03:06.666 --> 03:09.234
Don't come any closer to me.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.404
Get back.

03:13.438 --> 03:16.173
Get back, you little
son of a bitch.

03:16.208 --> 03:17.842
Carlisle,

03:17.876 --> 03:21.012
don't make me use this.

03:21.046 --> 03:22.914
That's right.

03:22.948 --> 03:26.484
Hey hey hey, get out all
of you, little turds.

03:49.644 --> 03:51.877
Ahh.

04:00.215 --> 04:02.382
Everybody stay back.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.150
Hey!

04:07.121 --> 04:09.222
Come here, I'll...

04:13.760 --> 04:15.861
Help!

04:17.063 --> 04:18.863
Help!

04:18.898 --> 04:22.667
Where was the surgery done?

04:22.701 --> 04:25.469
A field hospital
outside of Verdun.

04:25.504 --> 04:28.038
Three mo at Walter Reed.

04:28.073 --> 04:30.107
This is some fine work.

04:30.141 --> 04:32.208
So why does it hurt?

04:32.243 --> 04:35.077
The screws in the femur...

04:35.112 --> 04:37.012
could be a problem there,

04:37.047 --> 04:39.047
trauma to the nerve.

04:39.082 --> 04:41.082
So I got a screw loose?

04:41.116 --> 04:43.218
Do you think you do?

04:43.252 --> 04:46.120
It was a joke.

04:47.589 --> 04:49.756
<i>No numbness
or weakness?</i>

04:49.791 --> 04:52.358
It's more of a dull ache

04:52.393 --> 04:55.294
inside.

04:55.329 --> 04:59.465
It started recently.
It hurts like hell.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.167
How's your sleep?

05:01.201 --> 05:04.436
Off and on.
I'm up a lot.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.205
What do you do?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.407
I go for walks.

05:08.441 --> 05:09.942
I read mostly.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.978
You're employed?
What do you do?

05:13.012 --> 05:17.248
Oh, bell telephone.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.053
Have you ever heard
of Dr. Robert Woodworth?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.789
He developed a test
during the war

05:23.824 --> 05:25.524
to help the soldiers.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.659
We're giving it
to all the men who come in.

05:27.694 --> 05:28.894
What kind of test?

05:28.928 --> 05:30.929
It's called
a personal inventory.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.264
The war's over.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.833
It might be useful anyway

05:34.867 --> 05:36.468
for the country.

05:39.772 --> 05:43.775
"Set a high standard
for a clean America."

05:49.282 --> 05:50.982
What do I have to do?

05:51.017 --> 05:53.885
<i>Just answer a few questions
about yourself.</i>

05:53.920 --> 05:56.221
It could help you feel better.

05:56.255 --> 05:59.524
Sure, why not?

06:13.205 --> 06:15.106
How are you doing?

06:15.141 --> 06:17.175
<i>The doctor will be
right with you.</i>

06:17.209 --> 06:18.843
<i>Are you all right?</i>

06:33.159 --> 06:34.859
Try and hold still now.

06:34.893 --> 06:36.326
Good God almighty.

06:36.361 --> 06:38.495
Pop, come on.
One, two, three.

06:38.530 --> 06:40.231
You fucking butcher.

06:40.265 --> 06:41.565
Whoa whoa whoa!

06:41.600 --> 06:44.034
Pop, just let us
get you situated, okay?

06:44.069 --> 06:46.503
Ho ho ho,

06:46.537 --> 06:48.738
look who's come to pay a visit.

06:48.772 --> 06:50.472
I came as soon as I heard.

06:50.507 --> 06:53.407
I called your office.
Eddie said you were out with your lady-friend.

06:53.442 --> 06:55.376
Who's that?
Mabel?

06:55.410 --> 06:56.910
Mabel was my wife.
You know what.

06:56.945 --> 07:00.646
- One, two, three.
- Argh! God almighty!

07:00.681 --> 07:02.515
- Get him in there.
- Easy.

07:02.549 --> 07:06.452
- It's all right.
- Oh God.

07:06.486 --> 07:08.954
Five goddamn hours.

07:08.988 --> 07:12.357
I could have lost my leg if
your brother hadn't come by.

07:15.493 --> 07:17.227
Thank you,
Dr. Surran.

07:17.262 --> 07:18.929
All right, Mr. Thompson,
here we go.

07:18.964 --> 07:21.965
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

07:33.442 --> 07:37.243
I'll stop by the
hospital later, pop.

07:48.251 --> 07:51.087
So this woman...

07:51.121 --> 07:53.290
this Margaret Schroeder.

07:53.324 --> 07:55.526
Yes?

07:55.561 --> 07:57.095
What's going on there?

07:57.129 --> 07:59.764
- She's a lovely person, Eli.
- I'm sure she's a peach.

07:59.799 --> 08:01.800
She's also a widow, remember...

08:01.834 --> 08:04.169
pretty tragic circumstances?

08:04.203 --> 08:06.805
She knows nothing
and she never will.

08:09.008 --> 08:11.210
It smells like piss in here.

08:11.244 --> 08:13.212
Cat piss.

08:13.247 --> 08:15.448
That too.

08:18.385 --> 08:21.687
I'll call sailor's haven, see
if they have an extra room.

08:23.356 --> 08:26.025
- We can't do that. - Now I'm
supposed to get him a private nurse?

08:26.059 --> 08:28.561
<i>June and I will take him.
He can live with us.</i>

08:28.595 --> 08:29.929
What about your kids?

08:29.963 --> 08:32.063
The kids love him.

08:38.772 --> 08:41.674
I suppose it is time
to sell, huh?

08:44.744 --> 08:47.746
A lot of memories
in this place.

08:51.851 --> 08:53.852
We should give it to fleming,

08:53.887 --> 08:55.821
let him fix it up.

08:55.855 --> 08:58.157
They just had another baby,
more to come probably.

08:58.191 --> 08:59.491
Just give it to him?

08:59.526 --> 09:01.460
Let some decent family

09:01.494 --> 09:04.663
make a home of this shitpile.

09:10.470 --> 09:14.373
Goddamn toaster...
it cost me nine bucks.

09:14.408 --> 09:16.675
He never even plugged it in.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.594
Who done these?

09:39.629 --> 09:42.563
Ferschke over on Illinois.

09:42.598 --> 09:44.432
Ink don't even stick.

09:44.466 --> 09:46.367
Said he'd take 50 dollar off.

09:46.402 --> 09:48.670
<i>I don't care he pay me.
I can't use this shit.</i>

09:48.704 --> 09:51.039
<i>- - Mr. White?</i>

09:51.073 --> 09:54.509
<i>Mr. Chalky White?
Hello?</i>

09:54.543 --> 09:57.278
<i>Hello?</i>

09:58.247 --> 10:00.615
How do you do?

10:01.684 --> 10:03.618
You are, I assume,
Mr. White.

10:03.653 --> 10:06.387
<i>May I say it is both
an honor and a privilege</i>

10:06.421 --> 10:08.488
to be making your acquaintance?

10:08.523 --> 10:10.390
Fuck are you, shortpants?

10:10.424 --> 10:13.226
My name is Michael Lewis.

10:13.260 --> 10:16.295
I am a businessman.
I have traveled here today

10:16.329 --> 10:19.097
<i>from the borough of Manhattan
in the city of New York</i>

10:19.131 --> 10:21.799
to discuss
a proposition with you.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.234
May I approach?

10:23.268 --> 10:25.436
You may stay where the
fuck you're standing.

10:32.043 --> 10:34.144
What proposition?

10:40.017 --> 10:42.384
A boy, let us say,

10:42.419 --> 10:45.955
wants to buy a boiled wool
coat for his sweetheart.

10:45.989 --> 10:47.990
At Gimbels this coat puts him

10:48.025 --> 10:51.361
$12.46 out of pocket.

10:51.396 --> 10:54.731
On Rivington street this
identical coat costs what?

10:54.766 --> 10:56.400
This ain't no coat store, son.

10:56.434 --> 10:58.235
But the principle,
you'd agree, is the same.

10:58.269 --> 11:00.103
You make a certain
product, yes?

11:00.138 --> 11:01.905
It sells for a certain price

11:01.939 --> 11:05.942
based on quality,
cost, competition.

11:05.976 --> 11:08.611
So what do you say,
Mr. White?

11:08.646 --> 11:09.813
About what?

11:09.847 --> 11:11.882
<i>About my buying,
let's call it,</i>

11:11.916 --> 11:15.885
1000 cases of spirituous liquor

11:15.920 --> 11:18.221
directly from you

11:18.255 --> 11:20.789
to our mutual benefit.

11:20.824 --> 11:22.524
Cut out the middleman.

11:22.559 --> 11:26.295
Nobody ever gotta know
except you and me.

11:26.329 --> 11:28.498
Precisely right.

11:30.634 --> 11:34.069
Your mama know you're out wearing
your daddy's Sunday suit?

11:35.472 --> 11:37.239
No sir, she does not.

11:37.273 --> 11:40.342
She also doesn't know
that I have this.

11:41.543 --> 11:44.612
$10,000
in U.S. currency...

11:44.646 --> 11:46.981
<i>$500 notes.</i>

11:47.015 --> 11:51.218
And all you have do is
recognize an opportunity.

12:07.632 --> 12:09.600
Would you like to share
the punchline?

12:09.634 --> 12:12.201
Well, the punchline is
you tell Nucky Thompson

12:12.236 --> 12:14.169
it's gonna take
a lot more than 10 grand

12:14.204 --> 12:16.839
to get me to fuck him over.

12:22.846 --> 12:25.381
Well, you can't blame
a fellow for trying.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.519
Gentlemen.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.691
So it's me,
Eleanor and the baby,

12:36.726 --> 12:39.027
with the thunder booming
right outside the window.

12:39.061 --> 12:41.462
Next thing I know...
thanks, Nuck...

12:41.496 --> 12:44.598
next thing I know, little
Georgie, his sister and the cat

12:44.633 --> 12:47.534
are all crammed in with us
under the covers.

12:47.569 --> 12:50.103
I tell you,
a bedbug crawled in...

12:50.138 --> 12:53.472
the whole Megillah would have
collapsed under the weight.

12:53.507 --> 12:57.041
How old's the baby now anyway?

12:57.076 --> 12:59.109
A little over five months.

12:59.144 --> 13:03.280
It flies, boy. It was just
yesterday we brought her home...

13:03.314 --> 13:06.950
a scrawny little thing,
came seven weeks early.

13:06.985 --> 13:09.453
I owe it all to her mom though.

13:09.487 --> 13:12.522
<i>Night and day
she fed that kid,</i>

13:12.556 --> 13:15.124
<i>bundled her up close.</i>

13:15.159 --> 13:18.295
<i>I swear she didn't
put her down for a month.</i>

13:19.831 --> 13:22.599
Anyway, enough of my yammering.

13:22.633 --> 13:26.702
No, actually it's your family
that I wanted to discuss.

13:26.737 --> 13:29.038
Get off of me!

13:29.072 --> 13:32.508
- He's in a very important meeting.
- Eddie, stop.

13:32.543 --> 13:34.377
<i>Why won't you
return my calls?</i>

13:34.412 --> 13:36.413
- I am so sorry.
- Lucy, I'm in a meeting.

13:36.447 --> 13:38.114
I don't care.
I love you.

13:38.149 --> 13:40.049
<i>What does she have
that I don't have?</i>

13:40.083 --> 13:42.151
- Lucy...
- She's a fucking shopgirl.

13:42.185 --> 13:43.518
Calm down, okay?

13:43.553 --> 13:47.055
I left some of my clothes here.

13:47.089 --> 13:50.124
I'll call you, okay?
We'll have dinner.

13:50.159 --> 13:52.293
I want to go to the pictures.

13:52.327 --> 13:55.029
- Whatever you'd like.
- "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

13:55.063 --> 13:56.897
Fine. We'll talk
about it later.

13:56.931 --> 14:00.632
I feel empty
without you inside of me.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.868
We'll talk about that as well.

14:12.444 --> 14:15.279
I'm sorry about that.

14:19.885 --> 14:22.452
So you're still in that flat
over on Vermont?

14:22.486 --> 14:24.053
We are.

14:24.088 --> 14:26.055
You need a house, Damien,

14:26.089 --> 14:27.956
with a yard for the kids.

14:27.991 --> 14:30.125
That's the plan.
We're saving up.

14:32.494 --> 14:34.628
I want you to have
my father's place.

14:34.662 --> 14:37.997
He doesn't need it anymore and
I sure as hell don't want it.

14:38.031 --> 14:41.267
That sounds great, but we
couldn't afford it yet.

14:41.301 --> 14:43.669
I'm giving it to you,
no strings.

14:43.703 --> 14:47.072
You fix it up, make it livable.

14:49.442 --> 14:51.577
Gee, Nuck, I...

14:51.611 --> 14:53.278
I don't know what to say.

14:53.313 --> 14:55.214
Say thank you.

14:55.248 --> 14:57.949
Well, thank you.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.052
Thanks a million.

15:00.086 --> 15:02.955
You just made Eleanor and me about
the happiest people on earth.

15:02.989 --> 15:06.124
That's all I wanted to hear.

15:06.159 --> 15:09.694
Sometimes I'm not
sure what he wants from me.

15:09.729 --> 15:11.596
Then what's that big bed for?

15:11.631 --> 15:13.665
Besides that.

15:20.807 --> 15:23.875
The more important thing is
what do you want from him?

15:25.511 --> 15:29.080
<i>Well, I don't want
to lose this.</i>

15:30.216 --> 15:32.017
He'll never marry you,
you know.

15:32.051 --> 15:34.319
I know, I know.

15:34.353 --> 15:36.354
<i>The last girl... Lucy...</i>

15:36.389 --> 15:38.256
he'd been with her for ages.

15:38.291 --> 15:42.527
It would be nice to have
some certainty in our lives.

15:42.561 --> 15:44.829
I've been with Harry
three years now,

15:44.864 --> 15:46.431
and the only certainty I've got

15:46.465 --> 15:48.299
is stashed under a
floorboard in my bedroom...

15:48.334 --> 15:51.702
<i>almost $4,000 worth
of certainty.</i>

15:51.736 --> 15:53.771
You make him pay you?

15:53.805 --> 15:56.273
Not exactly.

15:56.308 --> 15:58.743
Rich men can be careless
with their money,

15:58.777 --> 16:02.079
especially the married ones.
The occasional 10-spot

16:02.113 --> 16:05.516
kited from his trousers
while he's asleep...

16:05.550 --> 16:07.451
it adds up after awhile.

16:07.486 --> 16:09.887
I could never do that.

16:09.921 --> 16:12.690
You might surprise
yourself someday.

16:13.758 --> 16:15.225
Do you love him?

16:15.260 --> 16:17.561
I'm fond of him.

16:17.595 --> 16:19.596
Is he in love with you?

16:19.630 --> 16:21.398
I don't think
he's gotten over his wife.

16:21.432 --> 16:22.899
What does he say about her?

16:22.933 --> 16:25.935
Not much. It's just
the impression I get.

16:25.970 --> 16:29.472
He's rather parsimonious
with his sentiments.

16:31.442 --> 16:32.908
That's probably just as well.

16:32.943 --> 16:35.779
The last thing you want
is him talking too much.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.447
What do you mean?

16:37.481 --> 16:40.350
<i>One thing I learned... not from Harry,
but from the one before him... much.</i>

16:40.384 --> 16:43.285
Let them keep their secrets
to themselves.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.955
<i>You let him open up
and bare his soul,</i>

16:46.990 --> 16:50.826
you'll be a constant reminder
of how weak he really is.

16:52.662 --> 16:54.363
Mama, come play.

16:54.398 --> 16:56.700
In a minute, my dear.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.669
Look at those curls.

16:58.703 --> 17:01.805
<i>Why, you'll have no trouble
getting a man at all.</i>

17:12.317 --> 17:14.050
Shut up.

17:14.085 --> 17:16.553
Anybody got change of a nickel?

17:16.588 --> 17:18.088
Oh, look who it is.

17:18.123 --> 17:20.858
Last time I saw you fellas
was in back of a paddy.

17:20.893 --> 17:23.428
- This is Charlie Luciano.
- And my pal meyer.

17:23.462 --> 17:25.630
- Mickey Doyle.
- How do you do?

17:32.471 --> 17:35.540
He says you're
a real solid fella.

17:37.843 --> 17:39.777
So why didn't you tell me
you was in town, eh?

17:39.812 --> 17:41.546
<i>- What are you doing here?
- Business.</i>

17:41.580 --> 17:43.548
Why else would I come to
this shithole-by-the-sea?

17:43.582 --> 17:45.849
Oh, Ganuzz.

17:53.355 --> 17:56.524
So let me ask you, how many times
you think you can knock over

17:56.559 --> 17:59.027
Nucky Thompson's bagman
before he bites back?

17:59.061 --> 18:00.628
It was easy pickings.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.429
<i>So it was you fellas.</i>

18:02.464 --> 18:04.898
We're getting a toehold
on the alcohol business.

18:04.933 --> 18:06.900
Needed a little scratch
to get things rolling.

18:06.934 --> 18:10.503
That's a nice take...
3,000 clams.

18:10.537 --> 18:12.438
It ain't hay.

18:12.473 --> 18:15.507
You do realize you owe Mr.
Rothstein for the privilege.

18:15.541 --> 18:19.175
You ain't got no jurisdiction
down in Atlantic City.

18:19.210 --> 18:22.912
They came here from Philly
on their own accord.

18:26.216 --> 18:28.917
Have you been noticing
the cost of gasoline?

18:28.951 --> 18:31.320
Last week goes from
18 to 20¢ a gallon.

18:31.354 --> 18:33.956
- Who is this kike?
- The name's Meyer Lansky.

18:33.990 --> 18:35.757
And he's a pal of mine,
like I said.

18:35.792 --> 18:39.694
Gasoline, like I said...
it's what moves America.

18:39.728 --> 18:42.530
Once you got the hooch, you
gotta distribute it, right?

18:42.564 --> 18:45.432
You gotta set up stills,
warehouses to store the stuff,

18:45.466 --> 18:48.235
<i>payoffs for the bulls,
politicians.</i>

18:48.269 --> 18:51.304
Bottles, crates,
labels... it adds up.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.139
You wanna run
a top-shelf operation,

18:53.173 --> 18:55.307
you're gonna need a lot
more than 3,000 bucks.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.610
- We got muscle. - Yeah, you and your
brothers against the whole city?

18:58.644 --> 19:01.813
So what are you saying?
Is Rothstein willing to back us?

19:01.847 --> 19:04.048
Show him you're capable.

19:04.082 --> 19:06.350
You been to Lolly Steinman's?

19:06.384 --> 19:08.986
<i>- The delicatessen?
- It's a casino.</i>

19:09.020 --> 19:10.787
Nucky Thompson owns it.

19:10.822 --> 19:13.657
End of a Saturday they got
150 grand in the cage.

19:13.691 --> 19:15.459
You fixing we rob the joint?

19:15.493 --> 19:17.561
And he's the smart one.

19:17.595 --> 19:20.997
We're gonna work out the details,
but 50% goes to a.R. In New York.

19:21.032 --> 19:24.701
The other 50 we use
to bankroll our next move.

19:24.735 --> 19:27.003
"We"?

19:32.843 --> 19:34.711
The name's Billy winslow.

19:34.745 --> 19:37.647
We got him dead to rights on an
armed robbery... a jewelry store.

19:37.681 --> 19:40.283
His mother's sick and he's
terrified of going to jail.

19:40.318 --> 19:41.952
And why is this my concern?

19:41.986 --> 19:43.954
As soon as I leveled
the charges against him,

19:43.988 --> 19:45.956
he started bawling like a baby,

19:45.990 --> 19:48.892
said he wanted to talk
to a fed from Atlantic City.

20:01.905 --> 20:04.006
Who are you?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.975
My name is Nelson van Alden.

20:06.009 --> 20:10.379
I'm a special Agent with the bureau of
internal revenue in Atlantic county.

20:10.413 --> 20:12.648
This is my colleague...
Agent Sebso.

20:12.682 --> 20:14.049
Hello.

20:15.819 --> 20:20.022
So I gather you've got a
story to tell, Mr. winslow.

20:20.056 --> 20:23.092
That depends.
What's in it for me?

20:23.126 --> 20:28.630
You're looking at 10 years
hard labor at Rahway.

20:28.665 --> 20:32.034
You're not exactly
in a position to bargain.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.443
There was a hijacking

20:41.477 --> 20:43.412
in the woods last January.

20:43.446 --> 20:47.783
<i>It was a truckloadful
of hooch headed to New York.</i>

20:48.885 --> 20:51.519
They left five bodies behind.

20:51.554 --> 20:54.122
How do you know this?

20:55.491 --> 20:58.092
'Cause I was there as a decoy.

20:58.127 --> 21:00.595
I blocked the road with my car.

21:00.629 --> 21:03.231
I wasn't involved
in any killing.

21:03.265 --> 21:06.300
It wasn't supposed
to happen like that.

21:06.335 --> 21:08.402
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

21:08.437 --> 21:10.471
Then why did they?

21:10.505 --> 21:13.140
Look, I can give you the ringleader
and you can just ask him.

21:13.175 --> 21:14.608
What's his name?

21:14.643 --> 21:17.377
If I tell you, do we have a deal?
You'll get me off?

21:17.412 --> 21:19.946
If you agree to testify,

21:19.980 --> 21:23.683
I'll use my influence
as best I can.

21:24.885 --> 21:27.420
His name's

21:27.454 --> 21:30.690
Jimmy Darmody.

21:30.724 --> 21:34.860
Was him and this fella
called al.

21:44.204 --> 21:46.706
Ronald Tineo.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.476
Yes ma'am.

21:51.245 --> 21:53.012
You like to read?

21:58.985 --> 22:00.953
It keeps me occupied.

22:00.988 --> 22:05.692
What is the book?

22:05.726 --> 22:09.162
It's, uh...

22:09.196 --> 22:11.330
Jesus.

22:14.935 --> 22:16.836
It's called
"the tin soldier."

22:16.871 --> 22:19.239
<i>It's a bunch
of malarkey.</i>

22:19.273 --> 22:21.708
Mm.

22:27.014 --> 22:30.183
Smoke?

22:30.217 --> 22:32.519
Mmm.
Not possible.

22:32.553 --> 22:34.554
Thomas farina.

22:45.332 --> 22:47.200
James Darmody.

22:47.234 --> 22:48.801
Richard harrow.

22:48.836 --> 22:51.504
Nice to meet you.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.284
Would you want this?

23:05.318 --> 23:07.786
My sister sends them to me

23:07.820 --> 23:10.155
because I used to enjoy them.

23:12.659 --> 23:15.093
You don't anymore?

23:16.663 --> 23:18.397
Mmm.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.966
It occurred to me

23:21.000 --> 23:24.636
the basis of fiction
is that people

23:24.670 --> 23:27.239
have some sort of connection

23:27.273 --> 23:29.374
with each other.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.176
But they don't.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.545
Thomas decatur.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.380
That's me.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.852
Thank you.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.957
They're making you
take the test?

23:45.991 --> 23:49.828
The nutcase test?
Yeah.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.963
And then they'll tell us

23:51.998 --> 23:54.199
if we're normal or not.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.635
I hear

23:56.669 --> 23:59.571
some of the questions
are embarrassing.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.610
Just lie.

24:05.644 --> 24:08.747
I find that difficult now.

24:12.351 --> 24:15.286
They're interested
in what's in our heads,

24:15.321 --> 24:18.656
so that next time
we'll fight better.

24:32.671 --> 24:35.640
I should leave this in my room.

24:35.674 --> 24:39.344
But if I don't have it
with me, I become anxious.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.045
A German sniper mask.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.082
Mm, I had to wait
a very long time

24:44.116 --> 24:46.684
for him to take it off.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.688
You were a marksman?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.990
I watched him

24:52.024 --> 24:53.825
from a blind

24:53.859 --> 24:55.927
for three days.

24:55.961 --> 24:59.397
He lifted it
to scratch his nose.

24:59.432 --> 25:01.099
I put a bullet

25:01.133 --> 25:03.802
one inch below his eye.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.571
Well,

25:06.605 --> 25:08.573
fuck him, right?

25:08.607 --> 25:09.874
Yeah.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.519
Mm, on the test

25:21.554 --> 25:23.288
they ask

25:23.322 --> 25:26.024
if you ever made love
to a girl.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.593
James Darmody.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.096
James Darmody.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.701
- He left.
- Did he say why?

25:36.735 --> 25:40.271
He said he was feeling fine
and then he left.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.242
Durier Frost.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.084
Richard harrow.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.889
He left too.

26:00.992 --> 26:03.661
Go ahead, try lying.

26:03.695 --> 26:07.297
Mm, yep, that's right.

27:49.831 --> 27:53.400
It's not like
he saw us together.

27:53.434 --> 27:58.572
Nucky Thompson didn't get
where he is by being naive.

27:58.606 --> 28:03.143
That look on his face...

28:03.177 --> 28:05.912
he knows something's amiss.

28:05.946 --> 28:09.015
So he knows.

28:09.050 --> 28:11.084
And then what?

28:11.118 --> 28:14.554
Well, he could stop
giving me money.

28:18.593 --> 28:21.661
You're so good.

28:28.569 --> 28:31.070
I depend on this man.

28:31.105 --> 28:33.940
What about Jimmy?

28:36.176 --> 28:38.444
I would have thought
he'd send something...

28:38.478 --> 28:40.813
if not for me, for Tommy.

28:40.847 --> 28:43.883
You just may have to
get a job, my sweet.

28:43.917 --> 28:46.318
I know.

28:47.988 --> 28:51.457
Anything from that
art dealer in New York?

28:51.491 --> 28:54.126
No

28:54.161 --> 28:56.828
but Robert's friend Jonathan
is coming in town

28:56.863 --> 28:59.598
to look at some real estate.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.235
He works at Washington square
gallery in greenwich village.

29:05.538 --> 29:09.641
He's agreed
to assess your work.

29:09.675 --> 29:12.477
Greenwich village?

29:14.713 --> 29:17.515
Can you imagine?

for coming out here

30:02.027 --> 30:03.694
and helping me out like this.

30:03.729 --> 30:05.963
Here's a little something
extra for you and the boys.

30:05.998 --> 30:08.032
<i>Make sure the guys
get the beers, okay?</i>

30:08.066 --> 30:11.467
- Watch out for rusty nails.
- And don't wander off.

30:11.502 --> 30:14.571
Chief sweeney, I see you
brought the whole company.

30:14.605 --> 30:17.106
- And half of ladder 38.
- I couldn't afford it otherwise.

30:17.141 --> 30:19.609
<i>Let's hope there are no fires in town.</i>

30:19.643 --> 30:21.477
Why don't you and the boys
take a breather?

30:21.511 --> 30:23.913
- Mind if we take a look?
- Be my guest.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.415
Oh, that's just a bunch of
junk your dad didn't want.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.751
No no, just bring
it in the house.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.419
Just do it now.

30:30.454 --> 30:33.189
- Right there.
- Where's the 2x4?

30:33.223 --> 30:35.391
The 2x4s are all piled
up over there to the right.

30:35.425 --> 30:37.560
Got it.

30:37.595 --> 30:39.196
Okay boys, take a break.

30:39.230 --> 30:41.765
<i>You got
about 10 minutes.</i>

30:47.305 --> 30:49.806
So this is it?

30:49.840 --> 30:52.674
You seem surprised.

30:52.709 --> 30:55.210
It's nicer than you described.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.912
It is now.

30:56.946 --> 30:59.882
It was filthy,
shameful actually.

30:59.917 --> 31:02.785
I used to dream about
fixing it up.

31:02.820 --> 31:06.522
Well, it's quite cozy.

31:06.557 --> 31:09.692
It's funny... it didn't seem all
that small when I was a kid.

31:09.726 --> 31:13.496
Because you were
small yourself.

31:13.530 --> 31:15.498
I look at my father now...

31:15.532 --> 31:18.701
he's this frail little man.

31:18.735 --> 31:21.037
When I was a kid,
he was the giant

31:21.071 --> 31:23.305
in "Jack and
the beanstalk."

31:23.340 --> 31:25.474
He frightened you.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.210
With good reason.

31:28.245 --> 31:31.313
Does he still?

31:31.348 --> 31:34.116
He can't hurt me now.

31:38.922 --> 31:40.956
On my ninth birthday
I made the mistake

31:40.991 --> 31:42.891
of reaching
for a piece of bread

31:42.925 --> 31:45.360
ahead of my dad
at the dinner table.

31:45.394 --> 31:47.428
He used this hot poker

31:47.462 --> 31:49.730
to remind me
that he eats first.

31:49.764 --> 31:52.399
I wondered how
you'd gotten that.

31:56.103 --> 31:59.671
There are times,
even to this day,

31:59.706 --> 32:02.607
where I'll lay awake in bed,

32:02.642 --> 32:05.210
thinking about the fact
that my father...

32:05.244 --> 32:08.545
the man who was supposed
to protect us, to provide...

32:08.580 --> 32:12.649
I'm no stranger
to a man's cruelty.

32:15.152 --> 32:17.953
Sometimes it's best to leave
the past where it is.

32:20.690 --> 32:23.358
I should check on the children.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.842
You live here?

32:42.876 --> 32:44.843
This is a whorehouse.

32:44.877 --> 32:46.678
Yeah.

32:51.316 --> 32:54.886
You want a drink?

32:54.921 --> 32:57.589
Bourbon.

32:57.623 --> 32:59.925
Two bourbons, the real stuff.

33:13.406 --> 33:15.006
Uh...

33:15.041 --> 33:16.508
You got a straw back there?

33:16.542 --> 33:17.842
<i>A straw?</i>

33:17.877 --> 33:20.712
The second drawer down...
down.

33:25.050 --> 33:27.351
To the lost.

33:35.026 --> 33:36.794
Again?

33:36.828 --> 33:38.362
Mmm.

33:40.966 --> 33:43.534
You have a gun
under your jacket.

33:43.568 --> 33:47.371
It's a colt 1903.

33:47.405 --> 33:51.842
Mmm, I have one of those

33:51.877 --> 33:55.112
and a Smith & Wesson
triple lock...

33:57.515 --> 34:00.150
A Roth-Steyr,

34:00.185 --> 34:03.787
a Webley .455,

34:03.822 --> 34:06.390
a mauser 1914...

34:06.424 --> 34:09.927
very small, mm,

34:09.960 --> 34:14.632
Enfield 1917 30-06,

34:14.666 --> 34:17.601
telescopic sight...
very accurate,

34:17.636 --> 34:20.304
accurate to 700 yards.

34:21.873 --> 34:25.743
Mmm.

34:25.777 --> 34:28.612
But I like the colt
in the hand.

34:30.849 --> 34:33.516
How do you use yours?

34:33.552 --> 34:35.819
How do you think?

34:35.853 --> 34:40.523
Oh... you use it
to kill people.

34:43.493 --> 34:45.494
It's very good for that.

34:49.632 --> 34:51.635
I want to introduce you
to someone.

34:51.668 --> 34:53.168
Odette!

34:55.072 --> 34:56.406
Odette.

34:57.675 --> 35:00.176
Hi.

35:00.211 --> 35:02.179
This is Richard harrow.

35:02.213 --> 35:04.448
He's a friend of mine.
He's a war hero.

35:04.482 --> 35:07.284
He needs to know how
grateful the nation is

35:07.318 --> 35:08.952
for his sacrifice.

35:08.986 --> 35:11.654
You're a patriot, right?

35:13.958 --> 35:17.794
I'm whatever you want me to be.

35:22.733 --> 35:25.034
I'll watch your things.

35:25.068 --> 35:26.836
I'll watch them.
It's okay.

35:26.870 --> 35:28.338
Come on, baby.

35:28.372 --> 35:32.976
I got a whole
ticker-tape parade ready.

35:33.010 --> 35:38.347
<i>♪ So now I've got
the crazy blues ♪</i>

35:38.381 --> 35:42.852
♪ since my baby went away ♪

35:42.886 --> 35:45.288
♪ I ain't got
no time to lose... ♪

35:45.322 --> 35:47.723
I'm sorry, Harry.
I'm not following you.

35:47.757 --> 35:50.359
International reply coupons.

35:50.393 --> 35:53.629
This Italian fella up in
Boston buys 'em in bulk,

35:53.663 --> 35:57.299
then sells 'em here at face
value, locking in his profit.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.601
Well, if it's so easy,
why doesn't everyone do it?

35:59.636 --> 36:01.570
All I know is he pays

36:01.604 --> 36:05.307
50% on your investment
within 45 days.

36:06.976 --> 36:10.045
I just re-upped third time in
a row, the whole nest egg.

36:10.079 --> 36:12.747
I'll let you know.

36:29.764 --> 36:33.133
Mr. White, say hello
to Harry price.

36:33.168 --> 36:35.102
Get a load of that.

36:35.136 --> 36:37.070
Chalky White...
the proprietor.

36:37.104 --> 36:38.872
Quite a place.

36:38.906 --> 36:41.275
You people certainly are
a lively bunch.

36:45.146 --> 36:47.814
So...

36:47.849 --> 36:49.450
I met your boy.

36:49.484 --> 36:51.118
I'm sure you heard by now.

36:51.152 --> 36:53.420
- What?
- Mr. Lewis...

36:53.454 --> 36:56.457
that little kid you sent round
with the bankroll to test me out.

36:56.491 --> 36:58.525
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.694
That's how it's gonna be, huh?

37:07.668 --> 37:09.836
Y'all have a good time.

37:10.905 --> 37:13.006
Where the hell are
our dates already?

37:13.041 --> 37:15.809
Garcon, more giggle juice.

37:15.843 --> 37:17.644
Right away, sir.

37:22.651 --> 37:24.552
And what were you boys
gabbing about?

37:24.586 --> 37:25.953
Business, what else?

37:25.988 --> 37:27.355
What else is there?

37:27.389 --> 37:29.957
- Politics.
- His two favorite topics.

37:29.992 --> 37:32.393
- His only two.
- That's not true.

37:32.428 --> 37:34.763
I'll talk baseball anytime.

37:34.797 --> 37:37.565
Baseball fan, eh?
I once owned a catcher's mitt

37:37.599 --> 37:41.068
signed by Hardy Richardson...
my prize possession.

37:42.604 --> 37:45.372
Come on, y'all.
Get up off of your seats.

37:45.406 --> 37:47.140
Harry, let's dance.

37:47.175 --> 37:48.909
I'm beat, doll.
Let's sit awhile.

37:48.943 --> 37:50.978
You can sit later.

37:51.012 --> 37:53.680
You can even lie down
if you want.

37:53.715 --> 37:57.985
Well, I'll certainly
take you up on that offer.

38:05.226 --> 38:07.160
Quite a couple.

38:07.195 --> 38:09.229
A bit of a mismatch,
you ask me.

38:09.263 --> 38:11.497
She seems to like him.

38:11.532 --> 38:14.033
She seemed to like
the last one too.

38:17.137 --> 38:20.373
<i>So you played baseball
as a boy.</i>

38:20.407 --> 38:21.841
Do you still have your mitt?

38:21.875 --> 38:23.276
What?

38:23.310 --> 38:26.479
Oh, uh, no.
It was stolen.

38:26.513 --> 38:29.749
That's too bad.
What happened?

38:29.783 --> 38:32.351
Nothing.
I don't know.

38:32.385 --> 38:34.886
A bunch of kids
robbed it, beat me up.

38:34.921 --> 38:38.223
My goodness.
Were you hurt?

38:41.093 --> 38:43.227
I don't want to talk about it.

38:56.307 --> 38:58.075
Is it ready yet?

38:58.109 --> 39:02.012
Commodore, you barely
ate nothin'.

39:02.046 --> 39:04.847
My stomach's on fire.

39:04.882 --> 39:07.984
Jerry.

39:08.019 --> 39:09.887
<i>Come here,
God damn it.</i>

39:09.921 --> 39:13.456
That ain't no
proper food for a dog.

39:16.928 --> 39:19.463
Oh Louanne, what the hell
are you doing out there?

39:19.497 --> 39:22.199
Just a minute now.

39:22.233 --> 39:24.601
Been near three months,
commodore,

39:24.636 --> 39:27.437
and Dr. Surran said
that maybe...

39:27.472 --> 39:29.606
hey, I told you
no doctors, damn it.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.341
Maybe you got worms.

39:31.375 --> 39:33.477
Worms my ass.

39:33.511 --> 39:34.845
I'm dying.

39:34.879 --> 39:37.147
Now now, hush up with that.

39:37.182 --> 39:39.683
Nucky Thompson come by?

39:39.718 --> 39:44.321
No sir, but he sent Mr.
Boyd on by with your envelope.

39:44.355 --> 39:46.356
He's getting too big
for his britches.

39:46.391 --> 39:48.325
Mr. Boyd, sir?

39:48.359 --> 39:50.728
Thompson, God damn it...

39:50.762 --> 39:54.098
sends one of his
fat-assed minions.

39:54.132 --> 39:57.134
I put the son of a bitch
where he is,

39:57.168 --> 39:58.802
and they put me in jail.

39:58.837 --> 40:02.373
I left the envelope
on your desk, commodore.

40:03.408 --> 40:05.409
Oh man.

40:11.082 --> 40:12.749
Jesus Christ, that's awful.

40:12.784 --> 40:14.785
You just lay down now.

40:14.819 --> 40:17.254
And I'll make my porridge paste

40:17.288 --> 40:20.958
with the tea leaves
and rub it on your belly.

40:32.805 --> 40:36.174
"In these days of indigestion
it is oftentimes a question

40:36.208 --> 40:38.442
as of what to eat
and what to leave alone.

40:38.476 --> 40:40.810
<i>Every microbe
and bacillus</i>

40:40.845 --> 40:42.712
<i>has a different way
to kill us</i>

40:42.747 --> 40:44.981
and in time will claim us
for their own.

40:45.016 --> 40:46.983
<i>There are germs
of every kind</i>

40:47.017 --> 40:48.918
<i>in every food
that will can find</i>

40:48.953 --> 40:50.787
in the market
or upon the bill of fare.

40:50.821 --> 40:53.156
Drinking water's just as risky

40:53.190 --> 40:55.358
as the so-called
deadly whiskey

40:55.392 --> 40:58.994
and it's often a mistake
to breathe the air."

40:59.029 --> 41:02.031
Bravo.

41:03.567 --> 41:06.001
Hooray!

41:06.036 --> 41:08.104
More coffee?

41:08.138 --> 41:10.105
No, thank you.

41:10.140 --> 41:12.207
- Can I be excused?
- You may.

41:12.241 --> 41:14.709
- Me too, please.
- Off you go.

41:30.224 --> 41:32.392
I've been feeling regretful

41:32.426 --> 41:34.394
about something I said.

41:34.428 --> 41:36.897
I'm afraid I took
some bad advice.

41:36.931 --> 41:38.699
Oh?

41:38.733 --> 41:41.635
In your house-
your father's house

41:41.670 --> 41:45.039
you began to tell me
of your troubles

41:45.073 --> 41:49.043
and I was quite selfish.

41:49.077 --> 41:50.911
It's all right.

41:50.945 --> 41:53.180
It's not.

41:53.214 --> 41:55.182
I want you to confide in me,

41:55.216 --> 41:58.652
to feel safe in doing so.

41:58.686 --> 42:02.322
We're obviously intimate

42:02.357 --> 42:05.425
in many ways,

42:05.460 --> 42:07.427
but I'd like you to feel

42:07.462 --> 42:11.065
that you can talk to me.

42:14.636 --> 42:17.004
The baseball mitt...

42:17.038 --> 42:19.906
some kids stole it,
so my father marched me down

42:19.941 --> 42:22.576
and made me challenge
them to a fight.

42:22.610 --> 42:27.114
<i>There were four of them,
years older than me.</i>

42:27.148 --> 42:29.082
I got beaten unconscious

42:29.117 --> 42:31.251
and was in the hospital
for 11 days.

42:31.286 --> 42:34.689
That's horrible.

42:34.723 --> 42:37.024
Life can be that way.

42:47.872 --> 42:48.973
Hello.

42:49.007 --> 42:50.975
Who's on the telephone?

42:51.009 --> 42:52.943
- A friend of Mr. Thompson's.
- Of course.

42:52.978 --> 42:55.346
- Be quiet.
- Come get me and we'll drive over.

42:55.380 --> 42:59.016
And give fleming a call.
I'm sure he'd like to see it.

43:02.720 --> 43:05.988
My father's house...
it's all done.

43:06.023 --> 43:07.756
Would you care to have a look?

43:07.791 --> 43:09.725
Oh, I'd love to,

43:09.759 --> 43:11.894
but I need to put Emily
down for her nap.

43:11.928 --> 43:15.631
- Can I come?
- Mr. Thompson's busy, dear.

43:15.665 --> 43:17.633
Uncle Nucky.

43:17.667 --> 43:19.768
Get your coat, kiddo.

43:52.002 --> 43:53.436
Remember me?

43:53.470 --> 43:55.170
Keep your hands on the table.

44:04.477 --> 44:08.745
The whore...
Pearl...

44:08.780 --> 44:10.814
I was just doing
Sheridan's bidding.

44:10.848 --> 44:12.782
Relax, I'm not gonna kill you.

44:14.951 --> 44:17.786
Did you serve, Liam,

44:17.820 --> 44:19.654
in the war?

44:19.689 --> 44:21.256
I had rheumatic fever.

44:21.290 --> 44:23.257
Three years.

44:23.292 --> 44:25.925
France mostly.

44:29.229 --> 44:34.066
It's almost impossible
to describe the horror.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.903
It's a living

44:36.937 --> 44:40.974
waking nightmare.

44:41.008 --> 44:44.544
There was a soldier...
a German.

44:44.578 --> 44:47.047
Him and his men tried
to attack our position

44:47.081 --> 44:49.782
in the argonne forest.

44:49.817 --> 44:51.884
It was nighttime.

44:51.919 --> 44:54.787
And while he was trying to climb
through some barbed wire,

44:54.822 --> 44:57.023
I shot him twice...

44:57.057 --> 44:59.025
once in the stomach,
once in the neck.

44:59.059 --> 45:01.994
He slumped
over the barbed wire.

45:02.029 --> 45:06.932
And no matter what he did
to try and wriggle free,

45:06.967 --> 45:09.268
it just got worse for him.

45:09.303 --> 45:12.806
I left him there
like that for days,

45:12.840 --> 45:16.209
listening to him
moaning, crying,

45:16.244 --> 45:19.446
<i>"mutti, mutti, mutti!"</i>

45:19.480 --> 45:22.682
That's German
for "mama, mama!"

45:22.716 --> 45:24.651
That's what he kept saying.

45:24.685 --> 45:29.154
The curious thing is
that despite the fact

45:29.189 --> 45:33.391
that his situation
was utterly hopeless,

45:33.426 --> 45:35.427
he didn't want to die.

45:35.461 --> 45:37.928
I offered to kill him
several times,

45:37.963 --> 45:41.898
but he just kept fighting,

45:41.933 --> 45:44.667
li some miracle
would befall him

45:44.702 --> 45:47.336
and get him out
of his predicament.

45:47.371 --> 45:50.506
We hold on
so desperately to life.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.307
Some people feel,

45:52.341 --> 45:54.709
certainly in that
soldier's situation,

45:54.743 --> 45:57.344
that being alive is...

45:57.379 --> 46:00.980
Is much much worse.

46:03.650 --> 46:07.019
I'm gonna go now.
I don't want to ever see you again.

46:07.054 --> 46:08.754
You won't.

46:08.789 --> 46:11.123
May I offer you
a glass of water, sir?

46:14.195 --> 46:15.963
You're very welcome.

46:19.835 --> 46:22.437
<i>Oh, ladies,
how are you doing?</i>

46:47.289 --> 46:49.323
Oh jeez.

48:33.579 --> 48:36.414
Pretty amazing, huh, pop?

48:38.984 --> 48:41.151
Can you believe
it's the same place?

48:41.185 --> 48:42.385
What's he doing here?

48:42.419 --> 48:44.753
I wanted him to see it
all fixed up.

48:44.787 --> 48:47.854
Well, he's seen it.
Now get out.

48:56.696 --> 48:59.230
You may think you're king,

48:59.265 --> 49:02.100
but you're not worth a goddamn.

49:05.236 --> 49:07.737
Yeah, get me out of here.

49:39.901 --> 49:42.002
Go wait in the car.
