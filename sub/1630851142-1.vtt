Hi.

00:45.538 --> 00:48.641
<i>Hi, I'm Sam.
This is my voice mail.</i>

00:49.943 --> 00:51.711
<i>Samantha, it's your mother.</i>

00:51.811 --> 00:53.580
<i>I don't remember
what time you get off,</i>

00:53.680 --> 00:55.314
<i>but please come home
right after.</i>

00:55.414 --> 00:57.984
<i>I need to talk to you
about something, okay?</i>

01:00.352 --> 01:02.055
Just make sure it's yours.

01:14.734 --> 01:16.335
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:16.435 --> 01:18.004
- How are you doing?
- Good.

01:18.103 --> 01:19.839
How was your weekend?

01:46.498 --> 01:50.402
<i>Reaching Jackson
Heights, Roosevelt Avenue.</i>

01:50.502 --> 01:56.009
<i>Transfers available
to 7 E and F...</i>

02:16.929 --> 02:17.997
Samantha?

02:19.297 --> 02:20.533
Hey.

02:20.633 --> 02:22.702
Listen, I need to talk
to you about something.

02:22.802 --> 02:25.203
- Come, sit.
- What's it about?

02:25.303 --> 02:26.839
Well, as you know,

02:26.939 --> 02:30.109
Derek and I have been seeing
each other for some time now.

02:30.208 --> 02:31.811
Two months.

02:31.911 --> 02:35.280
Well, actually,
we're moving in together.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.716
Here.

02:36.816 --> 02:39.251
You can have the couch
for as long as you need,

02:39.351 --> 02:42.354
but eventually we think
it's best for everyone,

02:42.454 --> 02:45.323
especially you, if you
found another place.

02:46.358 --> 02:48.027
Derek had a son
that's going through

02:48.127 --> 02:50.139
exactly what you're going
through and he thought it was...

02:50.163 --> 02:52.397
What is it that
I'm going through?

02:52.497 --> 02:56.201
Well, some people just have a
harder time finding their way.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.604
You made me break my lease
the last time I moved out.

02:58.705 --> 02:59.872
That was different.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.274
Derek is different.

03:02.374 --> 03:05.144
And we both know you don't
do well on your own.

03:05.243 --> 03:07.923
I need to say something, and it's
not because you're kicking me out.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.817
- No one is kicking you out.
- Okay, Derek is an asshole.

03:10.917 --> 03:13.251
What about... what about
what happened the last time?

03:13.351 --> 03:15.121
Okay? He's taking advantage of you.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.456
This is not
what you think that it is.

03:17.557 --> 03:19.257
Hi, sweetheart.

03:19.357 --> 03:21.326

06:41.761 --> 06:43.396
Thanks. You too.

Oh... yeah.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.671
Is he here?

06:51.771 --> 06:54.506
Well, he's out running
a few errands right now, but...

06:54.607 --> 06:56.108
he should be back in a few.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.177
I have the keys

06:58.277 --> 06:59.545

07:15.795 --> 07:18.297
I don't know, like,
eight years maybe?

07:18.397 --> 07:19.966
Something like that.

07:20.066 --> 07:22.335

07:22.435 --> 07:23.970

if you want to go

07:37.850 --> 07:39.018
Yeah, I'd like that.

08:44.683 --> 08:46.819

and I also paid those bills.

08:46.919 --> 08:49.722
They just need stamps,
and they're underneath the mail thing.

08:49.822 --> 08:52.658

08:52.758 --> 08:54.226

- I'm sure it's great.
- It's not.

10:46.338 --> 10:48.207
Good things
take time and effort,

10:48.307 --> 10:50.347

Sam, Matt Danger.

Oh, this is my friend, Sam.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.254
- This is Allie over there.
- Hi, Allie.

11:03.557 --> 11:04.690
We're about to eat.

11:06.058 --> 11:08.662
Oh, you're unbalanced, all right.

This is our new friend.

Hey, I'll take that
as a compliment.

- It's great to meet you, Sam.
- Yeah, it's great to meet you, too.

11:34.554 --> 11:37.022
Sam's an old friend of mine.
We grew up together here.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.793

I don't drink.

11:40.893 --> 11:42.494
Oh, it's okay.

- Yeah, is it yours?
- No.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.131
Mine won't be ready for a while.

11:46.232 --> 11:48.300
All right, tonight we have
a nice little pinot noir

11:48.400 --> 11:50.670
from the upper elevation
of Underwood Mountain.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.572
We know where Ray's is.

11:52.672 --> 11:54.807

to it than that.

12:17.564 --> 12:19.633
Everything looks really great.
Thank you.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.701
Of course.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.136
- You grew up here?
- Yeah, till I was 15.

12:24.236 --> 12:26.848
And then I moved back to Queens with
my mom after my parents split up.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.108
The Big Apple.
That's what they call it, right?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.843
Yeah.

12:30.943 --> 12:33.045
I've always wanted
to visit the Guggenheim.

12:33.145 --> 12:35.848

The architecture is insane.

12:35.948 --> 12:37.717

16:38.490 --> 16:40.693

- You're welcome.

16:43.028 --> 16:44.196
To you.

16:52.204 --> 16:55.909
So, the shop looks good.

16:56.009 --> 16:58.277
I saw Taylor
is working with you.

16:58.377 --> 17:00.680
Yeah, he's a good kid.

17:07.820 --> 17:09.254
You drink iced tea now?

17:09.354 --> 17:12.090
Hmm, yeah.

17:12.190 --> 17:13.593
You know, it's not bad.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.696
How long has it been?

17:17.730 --> 17:20.265
I'd get my two-year chip
next month.

17:22.367 --> 17:25.137
Had a couple of false starts,
as you know.

17:25.237 --> 17:29.107
Didn't want to jinx anything by
making a big deal about it this time.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.612
I'm doing good, though.

17:32.712 --> 17:34.914
Yeah, I... I got your letters.

17:37.249 --> 17:38.685
What can I get for you, hon?

17:38.785 --> 17:42.755
Um... you go first.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.424
Um, I'll have burger, fries.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.328
And for you?

17:49.428 --> 17:51.965
- Um, do you have a veggie burger?
- Yes, we do.

17:52.065 --> 17:53.933
- Okay, I'll have that.
- Perfect.

17:54.033 --> 17:56.268
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:02.441 --> 18:03.910
Are you okay?

18:04.644 --> 18:07.179
This is strange, I know.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.249
Look, I don't really want
to talk about everything.

18:12.284 --> 18:14.419
I just needed to get away
for a few days.

18:15.420 --> 18:18.357
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, of course it is.

18:19.792 --> 18:22.160
Mom has a new boyfriend
moving in, so.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.696
How's she doing?

18:24.731 --> 18:26.298
She's okay.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.834
Ups and downs.

18:27.934 --> 18:29.702
It's been a rough
couple of years.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.642
<i>Eight men.</i>

18:35.742 --> 18:37.509

18:37.610 --> 18:40.046
<i>All right, men.</i>

19:07.874 --> 19:10.076
- Morning.
- Hi.

19:10.175 --> 19:12.545
- Got any plans right now?
- What?

19:12.645 --> 19:14.714
Today's the first day
of the harvests.

19:14.814 --> 19:17.050
We're gonna be picking
at a few vineyards close by,

19:17.150 --> 19:18.618
and I thought
you'd like to come.

19:18.718 --> 19:21.020
We're also gonna be
staying the night.

19:22.487 --> 19:23.388
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

19:23.488 --> 19:24.724
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

19:24.824 --> 19:27.359
- Just give me a minute.
- Yeah, take your time.

You don't really get kind
of... outside of a steamboat.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.871
- You're wrong.
- I don't care that I'm wrong.

20:44.971 --> 20:46.806
It's about the two of them
together, you know?

20:46.906 --> 20:48.507
No, George Harrison forever.

20:51.778 --> 20:54.881
Okay, guys,
we're spending $35 total.

20:54.981 --> 20:57.449
- That means total.
- Got it.

21:04.924 --> 21:08.861
We share most of what
we make and Luna manages it.

21:08.961 --> 21:10.730
Did she get elected
town treasurer?

21:10.830 --> 21:13.566
Self-appointed,
actually, but she's probably

21:13.666 --> 21:15.668
the least bad option
we got, you know.

21:17.003 --> 21:18.838
That's not even food.

21:39.592 --> 21:41.828
Let's go!

21:41.928 --> 21:43.461
Oh, real nice.

21:56.374 --> 21:58.443
Honestly, there's not
much to it, really.

21:58.544 --> 22:02.181
Just pull from the back, make sure the
berries are, you know, weighed evenly,

22:02.281 --> 22:04.550
and the color is about the same.

22:05.952 --> 22:07.887
- Wanna try?
- Yeah.

22:13.358 --> 22:14.927
- This one?
- Yeah.

22:15.695 --> 22:17.597
That's perfect.

22:17.697 --> 22:19.732
Look at that.
You're becoming a natural.

22:31.644 --> 22:33.579
<i>All the greats
have had it, you know?</i>

22:33.679 --> 22:36.616
That thing that just
reaches out and grabs you,

22:36.716 --> 22:38.751
and says, "Fuck you,
world, listen up."

22:38.851 --> 22:41.587
Except wearing lipstick and shit
on stage does not make you an icon.

22:41.687 --> 22:44.323
It just makes you some other
dude trying to channel Bowie.

22:44.422 --> 22:46.125
Okay, A, don't hate
the comparison.

22:46.225 --> 22:48.003
We could all do
a hell of lot worse than that.

22:48.027 --> 22:50.462
And B, I'm just saying that
that shit works, you know?

22:50.563 --> 22:51.664
It's memorable.

22:51.764 --> 22:53.733
Like, think about
Kurt Cobain, you know,

22:53.833 --> 22:55.500
that whole troubled mind thing.

22:55.601 --> 22:57.469
Think about, like, KISS.

22:57.570 --> 22:59.906
Yeah, but that's not
stage craft for Kurt.

23:00.006 --> 23:02.407
Yeah, and KISS
just generally sucks.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.977
Sucks to the tune of they're
on pinball machines.

23:05.077 --> 23:06.812
- It's not about that.
- Have you played it?

23:06.913 --> 23:10.316
- No, but I do love KISS.
- Thank you.

23:10.415 --> 23:12.084
Think about, like,
The Doors, you know.

23:12.184 --> 23:14.120
- Like, think about Jim Morrison.
- Oh, God!

23:14.220 --> 23:16.265
Do you think that that guy didn't
understand the power of persona?

23:16.289 --> 23:19.125
Are you seriously gonna put yourself
in the same level as Jim Morrison?

23:19.225 --> 23:20.860
I'm just saying
that that shit works

23:20.960 --> 23:22.962
because it's memorable,
you know?

23:23.062 --> 23:25.430
It cuts through the static
or whatever, you know.

23:25.531 --> 23:28.000
Like, straight up, no one even
knew who I was in middle school

23:28.100 --> 23:30.636
until I showed up to class
in sixth grade wearing a bikini.

23:30.736 --> 23:33.873
And that was polarizing.

23:33.973 --> 23:36.075
God, I love that story.

23:37.410 --> 23:38.844
Do you play with them?

23:38.945 --> 23:41.113
Sometimes,
when His Majesty let me

23:41.213 --> 23:42.682
join in for a jam sesh.

23:42.782 --> 23:45.184
- What do you play?
- I play bass.

23:45.284 --> 23:47.219
Fuck off, Allie.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.289
So then, what do you do
after the harvest season?

23:50.389 --> 23:52.825
I teach coding
to kids in France.

23:52.925 --> 23:54.527
Wow, you speak French?

24:00.833 --> 24:02.500
Oy, vey, Mr. Pretentious
over here.

24:02.601 --> 24:04.804
My grandparents made wine
in the South of France.

24:19.517 --> 24:21.554
Luna, you got plans tonight?

24:21.654 --> 24:23.488
Yeah, I do.

24:24.790 --> 24:27.727
- Uh, no, thanks.
- All right.

24:28.828 --> 24:30.162
Tomorrow, then.

24:30.963 --> 24:33.699
Sorry, I'm just
really not interested.

24:35.034 --> 24:36.736
All right.

24:36.836 --> 24:39.839
Don't pretend like you haven't
been catching eyes with me, though.

24:39.939 --> 24:42.541
- I think you have that backwards.
- I just smiled.

24:42.641 --> 24:44.543
- See?
- She said no.

24:44.643 --> 24:46.545
What about that
don't you understand?

24:46.645 --> 24:49.291
What about this conversation makes
you think you're involved at all?

24:49.315 --> 24:51.350
The part where you made
my friend uncomfortable.

24:51.450 --> 24:53.586
- S'up, y'all?
- Do you know this dude?

24:53.686 --> 24:55.788
Oh, yeah, he's Brad.
He's a fucking creep.

24:55.888 --> 24:58.190
- Guys, it's fine. It's fine.
- I'm not a creep.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.693
It's fine that you guys
might not get paid tonight.

25:00.793 --> 25:02.962
- Fuck off, Brad.
- Please don't do that.

25:03.062 --> 25:04.864
You gotta take it up
with George next week.

25:04.964 --> 25:06.599
That was not part
of the arrangement.

25:06.699 --> 25:09.268
Well, the arrangement changed.

25:09.368 --> 25:11.404
Let me know
when you change your mind.

25:11.504 --> 25:15.074
You don't have to be slumming it with
the help, not with a body like that.

25:22.882 --> 25:24.717
Vili, help!

26:38.824 --> 26:40.326
They like you.

26:41.293 --> 26:43.229
What are their names?

26:43.329 --> 26:47.366
This girl here is Bella
and that one is Mack.

26:48.501 --> 26:51.203
Yeah. Yeah. Hi.

26:53.305 --> 26:56.342
I used to ride horses over in
White Salmon when I was younger,

26:56.442 --> 26:58.377
but I haven't seen one in years.

26:58.477 --> 27:01.213
Hi. Hey.

27:01.313 --> 27:04.884
I grew up on a cattle farm
in Costa Rica,

27:04.984 --> 27:07.720
so the smell of horse shit
just reminds me

27:07.820 --> 27:11.457
of being a kid, being free.

27:12.825 --> 27:14.894
What made you leave?

27:14.994 --> 27:17.597
I worked at an ad
agency with my cousin,

27:17.696 --> 27:21.901
and it was for sure a big step
for my family at the time,

27:22.001 --> 27:23.736
but I was miserable.

27:26.972 --> 27:28.874
So, you just left?

27:28.974 --> 27:30.075
Yeah.

27:31.043 --> 27:33.479
I left, started over.

27:35.481 --> 27:36.982
That's what I'm doing now...

27:38.552 --> 27:42.922
tracing my steps back to the places
that make me feel like myself again.

31:46.398 --> 31:48.167
It's not about you.
It's about society.

31:48.267 --> 31:51.538
- Oh, jeez.
- Or you as, like, a microcosm of society.

31:51.638 --> 31:53.773
Ah.

31:57.409 --> 31:59.111
I didn't know you played.

32:00.446 --> 32:02.047
Just a little.

32:02.147 --> 32:04.818
Whatever you're doing
is gonna beat the bass solo...

32:07.119 --> 32:09.521
I can't believe you brought
an acoustic bass to this.

32:09.622 --> 32:12.892
- Who sits alone in their room playing an acoustic bass?
- That is so you.

32:12.991 --> 32:14.960
It's fun. It's a vibe.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.863
Can you even hear that?

32:16.962 --> 32:18.964
Every time you guys talk
like this, it makes me

32:19.064 --> 32:20.834
just want to buckle down
and work on my app

32:20.934 --> 32:23.335
so I can bust out
of this liberal shit hole.

32:24.637 --> 32:26.739
- You're working on an app?
- Yeah.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.240
Oh, God, kill me now.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.877
It's a machine learning app
that generates melodies

32:30.976 --> 32:32.879
over chord progressions.

32:32.978 --> 32:36.315
That defeats the whole concept
of art as an original act of creation.

32:36.415 --> 32:39.384
- And it will never work.
- It already works, you know.

32:39.485 --> 32:41.588
Rock and roll has been
going on for 50 years,

32:41.688 --> 32:43.890
and we're still trying
to reinvent the wheel.

32:43.989 --> 32:46.091
You know, technology
is the future.

32:46.191 --> 32:48.327
It's inevitable that we're
gonna be using technology.

32:48.427 --> 32:51.598
- You're in a barn.
- What you're describing is so...

32:51.698 --> 32:53.666
You truly believe that?

32:53.766 --> 32:55.167
Nothing's original anymore?

32:55.267 --> 32:57.169
Well, I mean, I can't
speak for all art forms,

32:57.269 --> 33:00.239
but music specifically works
within a finite field

33:00.339 --> 33:04.009
of notes, rhythms, and timbres.

33:04.109 --> 33:06.846
And when you look
at classic rock, for example,

33:06.946 --> 33:10.215
you're hearing things that are
reminiscent of Bach and Beethoven.

33:10.315 --> 33:12.217
So when you look at...
when you look at music

33:12.317 --> 33:15.087
from more of a modeling
standpoint, at least, I think...

33:15.187 --> 33:17.523
What a terrible way to talk
about something that's so...

33:17.624 --> 33:18.892
But that's the point, you know.

33:18.992 --> 33:22.394
We live in a world
of algorithms, not symphonies.

33:22.494 --> 33:25.532
And no matter
what you say, all of us,

33:25.632 --> 33:28.601
all of you, are trying to reinvent
the wheel with rock and roll.

33:28.701 --> 33:30.737
We're born
a few generations too late.

33:30.837 --> 33:33.757
Well, I'd rather die trying than live
in the world that you're describing.

33:33.806 --> 33:36.074
And I can respect that, truly.

33:36.174 --> 33:37.744
What about people, though?

33:37.844 --> 33:39.979
Aren't they original?

33:40.078 --> 33:44.316
I think that deep inside,
everyone has something pretty unique.

33:44.416 --> 33:46.653
Like, when I look at you,
for example,

33:46.753 --> 33:50.389
I see something that I've never
really quite seen before.

33:50.489 --> 33:52.424
Bullshit.

33:52.524 --> 33:55.060
What, like, you look at me
and you see, like,

33:55.160 --> 33:57.764
kind of, like, an old-school,
classic-model type,

33:57.864 --> 33:59.632
musician, rock and roll,
or whatever.

33:59.732 --> 34:02.467
I see a big, beautiful heart.

34:05.203 --> 34:08.307
I see a fucking survivor.

34:11.243 --> 34:13.412
A rare kindness.

34:18.551 --> 34:21.320
You're just brilliant.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.956
Thanks, Luna.

34:23.056 --> 34:25.992
And I see somebody searching.

34:27.459 --> 34:28.995
A sojourner.

34:55.822 --> 34:57.522
Good morning.

34:57.624 --> 34:58.992
Morning.

35:00.258 --> 35:01.493
Hey...

35:02.629 --> 35:04.731
tell Matt today is the day.

35:04.831 --> 35:06.331
What?

35:06.431 --> 35:07.867
Just do it.

35:09.301 --> 35:10.837
Okay.

35:12.437 --> 35:14.306
Matt.

35:14.406 --> 35:15.808
Mm-hmm.

35:15.908 --> 35:18.510
Matt.

35:18.611 --> 35:19.979
Mmm?

35:20.079 --> 35:21.714

- <i>Where have you been?</i>
- Hi, Mom. I'm...

39:05.370 --> 39:07.740
<i>I really don't appreciate
you not returning my calls,</i>

39:07.840 --> 39:09.441
<i>not to mention
just up and leaving</i>

39:09.542 --> 39:11.244
<i>without anything more
than a note.</i>

39:11.344 --> 39:14.313
Sorry. Dad's been asking me to
come out here for more than a year

39:14.412 --> 39:16.549
and I just thought this was
as good a time as any.

39:16.649 --> 39:18.618
<i>Well, it was very embarrassing
for me with Derek,</i>

39:18.718 --> 39:20.987
<i>not even knowing you had left
until he saw your note.</i>

39:21.087 --> 39:22.288
<i>It was very selfish.</i>

39:22.387 --> 39:24.290
I thought you'd want
the place to yourself.

39:24.389 --> 39:26.559
<i>That doesn't mean you just
fly across the country</i>

39:26.659 --> 39:28.127
<i>without even telling me
about it.</i>

39:28.227 --> 39:29.595
<i>What if I needed you?</i>

39:29.695 --> 39:31.764
<i>And how did you lose
your phone on the plane?</i>

39:31.864 --> 39:33.933
<i>And why didn't you
realize it and go back?</i>

39:34.033 --> 39:37.737
I called the airline and they
said that they're looking for it.

39:37.837 --> 39:39.305
<i>How's your father?</i>

39:39.404 --> 39:42.775
He seems good,
you know, different.

39:42.875 --> 39:45.611
<i>Well, don't fall
for the whole new person story.</i>

39:45.711 --> 39:47.412
<i>No one ever really changes.</i>

39:47.512 --> 39:50.249
<i>Anyway, we got this cheap
wine, which made me look cheap,</i>

39:50.349 --> 39:52.118
<i>so I had to go back
to the store.</i>

39:52.218 --> 39:53.518
How are things going with Derek?

39:53.619 --> 39:54.987
<i>It's going very well,</i>

39:55.087 --> 39:56.365
<i>as much as you probably
don't wanna hear that.</i>

39:56.389 --> 39:58.658
Mom, I want you to be happy,
you know that.

39:58.758 --> 40:01.526
<i>Well, you sure do have a strange
way of communicating that.</i>

40:01.627 --> 40:03.195
<i>I feel great, though.</i>

40:03.296 --> 40:06.132
- <i>I think he's my soul mate.</i>
- Good. I'm glad.

40:06.232 --> 40:08.433
Just... no matter
how good you feel,

40:08.534 --> 40:10.369
just remember to take
your meds, okay?

40:10.468 --> 40:12.138
<i>You don't have to talk
to me like that.</i>

40:12.238 --> 40:13.539
<i>I'm not a child.</i>

40:13.639 --> 40:15.284
<i>I'm not the one
leaving phones on airplanes.</i>

40:15.308 --> 40:17.843
Mom, just promise me.

40:17.944 --> 40:19.278
<i>Okay, yes, I promise.</i>

40:19.378 --> 40:21.113
<i>Jesus, enough already.</i>

40:21.213 --> 40:22.648
<i>Something good
comes along for me</i>

40:22.748 --> 40:24.750
<i>and all you ever see
is the other side.</i>

40:37.663 --> 40:39.365
So, what's the deal with Allie?

40:39.464 --> 40:40.766
What do you mean?

40:41.968 --> 40:45.071
- Like, have you two ever...
- No.

40:45.171 --> 40:47.807
She and I met a few years back
through Matt, actually.

40:47.907 --> 40:50.242
Um, and she scared me at first,

40:50.343 --> 40:52.578
but she is a really good friend,

40:52.678 --> 40:55.881
Sort of helped me through
a pretty dark time in my life.

40:55.982 --> 40:57.717
What made it such a dark time?

41:00.619 --> 41:03.589
Well, my mom died.

41:03.689 --> 41:06.659
- What?
- Yeah.

41:06.759 --> 41:09.195
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

41:09.295 --> 41:11.330
It's okay. I'm... I'm okay.

41:13.966 --> 41:16.569
What happened, if you...
I mean, you don't have to talk about it.

41:16.669 --> 41:19.905
- I just...
- No, I... I don't mind, honestly.

41:20.006 --> 41:21.874
And don't feel bad.

41:23.508 --> 41:28.114
But, yeah, um, the doctor said
that she had a brain aneurysm.

41:28.214 --> 41:32.018
And I came home one day
on my senior year,

41:32.118 --> 41:35.721
and she was just on the floor
in the kitchen.

41:37.656 --> 41:40.359
That day, that year...

41:42.795 --> 41:44.930
Yeah, and I never thought
something could hurt

41:45.031 --> 41:47.600
so much for so long like that.

41:50.169 --> 41:53.272
Yeah, it's been
almost about five years

41:53.372 --> 41:55.708
and it still feels like
a couple of weeks ago.

41:57.743 --> 42:00.913
But, like, what can you do?

42:02.948 --> 42:04.950
I loved her so much.

42:07.253 --> 42:09.221
Yeah, she really loved you too.

42:37.950 --> 42:39.718
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

42:41.353 --> 42:43.489
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

42:45.124 --> 42:47.093
Hey.

42:47.193 --> 42:48.961
Maybe you wanna
hang out tomorrow,

42:49.061 --> 42:50.729
just the two of us?

42:52.898 --> 42:54.500
Yeah, I'd like that.

42:54.600 --> 42:58.504
Wear something nice, but not,
like, too nice, all right?

42:58.604 --> 43:01.640
- Bye! Have a good night, guys.
- Good night.

43:18.558 --> 43:20.693
You have to do this every day?

43:20.793 --> 43:22.795
At least twice a day, ideally.

43:24.930 --> 43:28.334
- Feels kind of great.
- Right?

43:28.434 --> 43:30.169
How many bottles will this make?

43:30.269 --> 43:32.471
This should be about five cases,

43:32.572 --> 43:34.306
and each case is 12 bottles.

43:34.406 --> 43:35.708
So it's bad.

43:35.808 --> 43:37.688
You have an awful lot
of bad wine on your hands.

43:37.743 --> 43:39.979
Yeah, except it's not
gonna be bad, Matt.

43:41.413 --> 43:44.884
Vil, tell her that thing
that your grandma used to say.

43:44.984 --> 43:47.554
Uh, my grandma used to say
that when you bottle wine,

43:47.653 --> 43:49.688
you're bottling
a moment in time.

43:49.788 --> 43:52.691
The sun, the smell, the grapes
in the vineyard air

43:52.791 --> 43:54.260
all go into that moment.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.895
And when you open the bottle,

43:55.995 --> 43:57.564
you have access to that moment.

43:57.663 --> 44:00.332
- God, I fucking love that.
- Right?

44:00.432 --> 44:01.867
She was a great lady.

44:01.967 --> 44:04.236
- She doesn't make it anymore?
- Sadly, no.

44:04.336 --> 44:06.872
Uh, but she stayed at it
right up until the end.

44:06.972 --> 44:10.052
She had me doing exactly what you're
doing right now when I was eight or nine,

44:10.109 --> 44:13.245
and the grapes came up so high
on me that I could barely move.

44:13.345 --> 44:16.916
I still have a bottle of hers that
I'm saving for just the right moment.

44:17.016 --> 44:20.085
I'm just glad that she didn't live long
enough to actually taste that wine.

44:20.186 --> 44:21.621
Pain might have
killed her sooner.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.789
God, Matt, you're such a dick.

44:23.889 --> 44:25.559
I'm just kidding.

44:25.659 --> 44:27.826
Looks like
you're about ready to go.

44:29.061 --> 44:31.230
Ah, two and a half minutes.

44:32.666 --> 44:35.801
Ooh. You good?

44:35.901 --> 44:37.571
- Yeah.
- Okay.

44:41.974 --> 44:43.776
- Come on, just tell me.
- No.

44:43.876 --> 44:45.044
Please?

44:45.144 --> 44:46.779
Okay, I'll give you
three chances,

44:46.879 --> 44:49.315
and if you guess it,
I'll tell you.

44:49.415 --> 44:50.617
All right.

44:53.687 --> 44:55.721
- Suzanne Whitman?
- Fuck, no.

44:56.590 --> 44:58.257
- Okay.
- Not even close.

45:02.562 --> 45:03.762
Beth Lyman?

45:04.863 --> 45:07.567
Almost, but no.

45:07.667 --> 45:10.836
She works on a cruise ship and
she sends everyone postcards

45:10.936 --> 45:13.472
like we're, you know,
still in high school or something.

45:13.573 --> 45:16.242
It's kind of weird.

45:16.342 --> 45:17.644
Okay, okay.

45:22.514 --> 45:23.983
Not Kelly Brennan?

45:24.083 --> 45:25.117
No way.

45:27.419 --> 45:29.656
Oh, my God!

45:29.755 --> 45:31.691
- Wow!
- Stop.

45:31.790 --> 45:33.325
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, all right.

45:33.425 --> 45:35.961
- My choices weren't endless.
- Yikes.

45:37.429 --> 45:38.831
Who'd you go with, then?

45:40.199 --> 45:42.636
Junior year I didn't go.

45:43.469 --> 45:44.370
Why?

45:44.470 --> 45:45.804
Um...

45:45.904 --> 45:48.173
my mom had a really bad
break-up in the morning,

45:48.274 --> 45:50.009
so I had to stay home
and take care of her,

45:50.109 --> 45:52.679
and I canceled on a guy
named, uh, Mike Murphy.

45:52.778 --> 45:54.614
- Mike Murphy?
- Yeah.

45:54.714 --> 45:57.216
- That's a solid name.
- Yeah.

45:57.316 --> 46:00.219
Uh, he never spoke to me again, so.

46:00.319 --> 46:02.689
And then senior year,
I went with a guy

46:02.788 --> 46:05.124
that I had just started seeing,

46:05.224 --> 46:07.493
um, who was four years
older than me.

46:07.594 --> 46:09.495
His name was John Lansing.

46:10.764 --> 46:13.365
What about you,
Who did you go with senior year?

46:13.465 --> 46:17.069
Dropped out because
of my mom, you know.

46:17.169 --> 46:18.971
Just needed to start working.

46:24.276 --> 46:27.813
And your dad offered me a job,
which I'm really grateful for

46:27.913 --> 46:29.549
because I didn't know much
at the time

46:29.649 --> 46:33.852
and, you know, he showed me
everything I needed to know.

46:38.424 --> 46:40.492
It was just really giving me
a hard time.

46:42.194 --> 46:43.663
You didn't want to go back?

46:44.798 --> 46:46.432
Didn't really saw the point.

46:46.533 --> 46:48.735
I just needed to stay busy.

46:50.704 --> 46:53.038
The crowd goes wild.

46:53.138 --> 46:54.173
Come on.

47:01.213 --> 47:02.649
Oh, shit.

47:06.218 --> 47:08.588
Oh!

47:09.823 --> 47:11.758

48:32.371 --> 48:34.874
It's... all the rain
and the spring,

48:34.973 --> 48:37.176
it makes the soil super fertile.

48:37.276 --> 48:39.044
Everything grows really easily.

48:39.144 --> 48:41.013
So do these weeds.

48:47.319 --> 48:49.221
This one is insane.

48:49.321 --> 48:51.658
Thanks.

48:51.758 --> 48:54.561
Um, they're mostly just
concepts for paintings.

48:54.661 --> 48:57.697
But I think that's what I like,
when they're just potential.

49:00.098 --> 49:02.201
Have you ever sold your work?

49:02.301 --> 49:05.037
Actually, for the first time
this year,

49:05.137 --> 49:07.406
a gallery took
a couple of my paintings.

49:07.506 --> 49:10.577
One of them sold,
and I couldn't believe it, really.

49:10.677 --> 49:12.612
Oh, I could
totally believe that.

49:14.781 --> 49:18.217
My dream is to have
an artist residency

49:18.317 --> 49:21.186
on a property
up in the mountains,

49:21.286 --> 49:26.325
a place where artists
can come, create, heal.

49:31.664 --> 49:35.300
How do you know you could
do it, like, be an artist?

49:36.101 --> 49:38.237
I don't know.

49:38.337 --> 49:40.540
I guess drawing and painting

49:40.640 --> 49:44.009
just make it easier for me
to live with myself.

49:44.811 --> 49:47.079
- You don't know how to shuffle.
- I don't... me?

49:47.179 --> 49:48.982
You haven't even started yet.

49:49.782 --> 49:52.084
- Two fives.
- Bullshit.

49:52.184 --> 49:54.554
- It was real, dude.
- Really?

49:54.654 --> 49:56.623
- Yikes.
- All right, one, two.

49:56.723 --> 49:58.925
- All right.
- Bullshit.

50:01.360 --> 50:04.296
- No, we're not.
- Hey!

50:04.396 --> 50:05.532
That sucks.

50:05.632 --> 50:07.534
Like, when you've gotten
so good at cards

50:07.634 --> 50:10.603
that you've gone to, like, the World
Series of Poker, or whatever the fuck,

50:10.703 --> 50:13.138
I would pay to have the entire
deck stacked against you,

50:13.238 --> 50:16.709
just bad hand after bad hand
after fucking bad hand.

50:16.809 --> 50:18.319
- What's a rich-person prank?
- Two fives.

50:18.343 --> 50:20.145
It's like where if you had
unlimited resources

50:20.245 --> 50:22.147
to mess with somebody
at your disposal.

50:22.247 --> 50:25.552
Yeah, I had one where Matt's
playing the biggest show of his life

50:25.652 --> 50:27.921
and everyone in the audience
is a paid actor,

50:28.021 --> 50:29.254
so he plays this first song,

50:29.354 --> 50:30.890
which is inevitably
disappointing,

50:30.990 --> 50:33.392
and everyone just starts
filtering out one by one

50:33.492 --> 50:35.427
until he's left playing
to an empty room,

50:35.527 --> 50:38.831
which, incidentally, perfect title for
that memoir you've been working on.

50:38.932 --> 50:41.333
All right, I got one...

50:41.433 --> 50:44.336
where Vili here, when he gets
to his fucking dream paradise,

50:44.436 --> 50:46.582
when he's in, like,
the startup whatever the hell he does...

50:46.606 --> 50:50.309
- Don't doubt it.
- Gets that dream house in Pasadena or a fucking Mars,

50:50.409 --> 50:52.679
- wherever you go when you're rich.
- One of the two.

50:52.779 --> 50:54.479
Where you got your dream house

50:54.581 --> 50:56.983
and I pay to have it completely
leveled when you're gone,

50:57.115 --> 50:59.251
rebuilt like at the end
of <i>Freddy Got Fingered,</i>

50:59.351 --> 51:00.753
upside down.

51:00.853 --> 51:03.488
I've got one, but I'm not
even going to tell you guys

51:03.590 --> 51:05.524
because I'm probably gonna
do it to one of you.

51:05.625 --> 51:07.860
Okay, I'm actually scared.

51:07.961 --> 51:10.495
But I do like the idea of
cutting the brakes in the truck

51:10.597 --> 51:12.497
right before Matt goes to drive.

51:12.599 --> 51:14.601
- Whoa.
- Okay.

51:14.701 --> 51:17.135
Well, one, that's not
a rich-person prank

51:17.235 --> 51:19.038
because it doesn't cost
any money.

51:19.137 --> 51:21.608
And two, that's called
murder, you fucking psycho.

51:24.944 --> 51:26.345
Fuck it. It doesn't matter.

51:26.445 --> 51:28.480
- It doesn't matter.
- Just somebody go.

51:28.581 --> 51:31.116
- Sam, tell us something interesting about you.
- Bullshit.

51:31.216 --> 51:33.385
- No, it's real.
- Damn.

51:33.485 --> 51:35.655
When I was younger,
I used to sing opera.

51:35.755 --> 51:38.457
Yeah, I had this lady come
to my house every weekend.

51:38.558 --> 51:40.627
Oh, fuck, dude, opera's fire.

51:40.727 --> 51:42.160
- I love opera.
- Word.

51:42.260 --> 51:43.796
- No.
- Oh.

51:43.896 --> 51:45.197
Not me.

51:45.297 --> 51:46.775
And I can balance
anything on my head.

51:46.799 --> 51:47.867
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:47.967 --> 51:49.802
Show us.

51:51.236 --> 51:52.538
Oh, my God.

51:52.639 --> 51:54.073
- Wow!
- Wow.

51:54.172 --> 51:56.341
- Wow.
- That's pretty cool.

51:56.441 --> 51:58.243
- That's a life skill.
- I can hold...

51:58.343 --> 51:59.846
Please don't drop that on me.

51:59.946 --> 52:02.347
I can hold my breath
so my body doesn't even move,

52:02.447 --> 52:04.516
so I'd be perfect
for, like, a crime show.

52:04.617 --> 52:06.919
Like, the beginning scene
when there's a dead body?

52:07.020 --> 52:08.353
Whoa, so true.

52:08.453 --> 52:11.591
One three, Uno out, bitches.

52:11.691 --> 52:13.191
All right, second place, then?

52:13.291 --> 52:14.827
I just don't care. I'm done.

52:14.927 --> 52:16.487
Well, I can do
a sick Australian accent.

52:16.529 --> 52:18.531
- Really? Do it.
- Let's hear it.

52:20.033 --> 52:22.234
G'day, mate! Danger's me name.

52:22.334 --> 52:24.037
Playing music's me game.

52:24.137 --> 52:26.338
Please, next time you
think to do that, spare us.

52:26.438 --> 52:28.541
You sound like a fucking pirate.

52:28.641 --> 52:30.442
I'm pretty good at masturbating.

52:32.111 --> 52:33.713
- What, anywhere?
- Oh, my God!

52:33.813 --> 52:35.782
- Yeah.
- In a room with four other people?

52:35.882 --> 52:37.750
Wait, yeah,
you're right next to my bed.

52:37.850 --> 52:39.384
- I'm quiet.
- Dang.

52:39.484 --> 52:41.253
- Oh, my God.
- You are a deep sleeper.

52:41.353 --> 52:42.955
That's true, lots of wine.

52:43.056 --> 52:44.456
That's another life skill,
no doubt.

52:44.557 --> 52:46.491
No boo, no boo, no boo.

52:55.300 --> 52:57.737
Al, Al, Al.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.755
Go ahead.

53:53.025 --> 53:54.160
Nice.

54:00.900 --> 54:03.335
So, what's my dad like
these days?

54:03.435 --> 54:05.303
You know...

54:05.403 --> 54:07.840
pretty quiet, I guess,
keeps to himself.

54:07.940 --> 54:09.942
Likes the work.

54:10.042 --> 54:12.344
Yeah, he seems really different.

54:12.444 --> 54:13.846
People change.

54:13.946 --> 54:15.648
It's been a long time.

54:15.748 --> 54:17.049
Yeah, I guess.

54:17.150 --> 54:19.051
He's happy to have you
here, though.

54:19.152 --> 54:21.053
That's for sure.

54:21.154 --> 54:23.022
Does he say anything about me?

54:23.990 --> 54:25.457
Little things here and there.

54:25.558 --> 54:29.629
Like, he'll mention you
as if you're still here, but...

54:31.998 --> 54:34.033
I guess it helps.

54:34.133 --> 54:35.467
I'm gonna go pay.

54:35.568 --> 54:37.203
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

54:56.122 --> 54:57.522
I'll drive.

54:57.623 --> 54:59.357
You remember how?

54:59.457 --> 55:01.227
Taylor, I taught you
how to drive.

55:01.326 --> 55:02.460
Okay.

55:03.863 --> 55:05.363
Just don't kill me.

57:06.886 --> 57:08.453
It's so beautiful here.

57:12.457 --> 57:14.660
I always pictured
bringing you here.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.195
Really? Why?

57:17.163 --> 57:20.700
It's gonna sound strange,
but remember those blanket forts

57:20.800 --> 57:23.602
we used to make as kids
at my mom's place?

57:24.670 --> 57:27.273
Yeah, I do.

57:28.274 --> 57:31.143
Every time I'm out here,
I... I just think of that.

57:34.680 --> 57:35.982
I don't know why.

57:42.321 --> 57:43.723
Taylor, I lied to you.

57:49.494 --> 57:51.364
I lied to you about New York.

57:53.432 --> 57:55.735
I don't work at a photo studio.

57:57.103 --> 58:00.906
I work a graveyard shift
at a copy and print shop.

58:03.376 --> 58:05.578
I'm afraid to show my photos.

58:07.680 --> 58:09.915
I don't think they're any good.

58:10.016 --> 58:13.853
And my life looks nothing
like the one that I pictured.

58:17.623 --> 58:19.458
I'm sorry
that I lied to you, but...

58:19.558 --> 58:21.560
Don't apologize for that.

58:21.660 --> 58:23.696
None of that matters to me.

58:28.467 --> 58:32.571
I think just being back here
has made me realize

58:32.671 --> 58:35.574
all the dreams that I've had
that are slipping away

58:35.674 --> 58:37.710
without me even realizing it.

58:39.912 --> 58:42.615
Maybe that's why
you're here now...

58:42.715 --> 58:44.784
to find that.

58:44.884 --> 58:47.853
What did that 15-year-old
want with her life?

58:56.062 --> 58:58.197
I wanted to be a photographer.

58:59.698 --> 59:01.901
I wanted to shoot for magazines.

59:02.001 --> 59:04.070
I wanted to travel the world.

59:04.170 --> 59:05.871
I wanted to move to LA.

59:07.006 --> 59:08.207
Why LA?

59:11.343 --> 59:14.680
I had this book of Stephen Shore
photographs from his LA series,

59:14.780 --> 59:17.716
and I was just obsessed with it.

59:20.719 --> 59:22.188
I would look at those photos

59:22.288 --> 59:25.157
and I would just think,
"I belong here."

59:26.859 --> 59:27.993
Yeah?

59:29.028 --> 59:31.497
You know when you're a kid
and you think

59:31.597 --> 59:34.834
you are the only person
that has a dream like that?

59:38.237 --> 59:41.240
I don't think anyone sees the
world the way you do, Sam.

59:46.745 --> 59:48.080
It's all just...

59:50.049 --> 59:52.485
more complicated now.

59:52.586 --> 59:55.087
You don't have to
figure it all out tonight.

59:57.890 --> 1:00:00.359
We can just pretend
things are simple again.

It's not like a...
like a solo project.

1:03:01.974 --> 1:03:05.311
- It's more of, like, a side thing.
- Okay.

1:03:05.411 --> 1:03:06.713
Allie is going to hate it.

1:03:06.812 --> 1:03:08.612
It's like when Lennon
first heard "Yesterday,"

1:03:08.682 --> 1:03:11.059
and he's like, "There's no way we're
gonna release that as a single."

1:03:11.083 --> 1:03:13.485
- "It's too soft."
- Okay, just show me.

1:03:13.586 --> 1:03:14.721
All right.

1:03:15.689 --> 1:03:18.324

- Matt, just play it!

- <i>♪ What I need is... ♪</i>
- Ten bucks, best out of three?

1:03:40.379 --> 1:03:43.717
- <i>♪ What I need is... ♪</i>
- I got five.

1:03:43.817 --> 1:03:46.586
- <i>♪ What I need is... ♪</i>
- You shoot first.

1:03:46.686 --> 1:03:48.253
That'll do.

1:03:53.793 --> 1:03:55.861
Shit.

1:04:00.966 --> 1:04:02.334
Can't see it.

1:04:04.970 --> 1:04:06.405
Come...

1:04:06.505 --> 1:04:07.674
All right.

1:04:10.376 --> 1:04:14.480
<i>♪ What I want is, want is ♪</i>

1:04:14.581 --> 1:04:17.416
<i>♪ Want is you... ♪</i>

1:04:17.516 --> 1:04:19.385
- As if.
- Pay up, motherfucker.

1:04:19.485 --> 1:04:21.320
- This gun fucking sucks.
- You suck.

1:04:21.420 --> 1:04:24.089
- Pay me.
- Double or nothing.

1:04:25.524 --> 1:04:27.526
I'm like a hillbilly Lara Croft.

1:04:30.929 --> 1:04:32.565
Shit!

1:05:06.566 --> 1:05:09.903
I really, really like it.

1:05:11.771 --> 1:05:13.005
Thanks.

1:05:13.105 --> 1:05:15.675
Yeah, it's... it's really good.

1:05:17.409 --> 1:05:18.477
Cool.

1:05:19.546 --> 1:05:21.447
How can you not see
there's something broken?

1:05:21.548 --> 1:05:24.149
Yeah, but what are you even
talking about, like, anti-capitalist?

1:05:24.249 --> 1:05:25.729
That's like me saying
I'm anti-oxygen.

1:05:25.819 --> 1:05:28.320
I depend on it
every day of my life.

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:31.791
We're actually a lot less
dependent than you think.

1:05:31.891 --> 1:05:34.226
Guys, this bread's
not even expired.

1:05:34.326 --> 1:05:35.728
This is what
the system produces...

1:05:35.829 --> 1:05:37.963
need and waste simultaneously.

1:05:38.063 --> 1:05:39.566
It's fucked up
on so many levels.

1:05:39.666 --> 1:05:42.134
But there's always been need.
That's intrinsic to humanity.

1:05:42.234 --> 1:05:45.170
There's always going to be
some kind of need.

1:05:45.270 --> 1:05:47.248
You just think you're gonna
make a fortune someday,

1:05:47.272 --> 1:05:49.392
and maybe you will,
but the rest of us probably won't.

1:05:49.475 --> 1:05:53.045
I saw a documentary one time
that said that, like...

1:05:53.145 --> 1:05:56.549
um, that, like, half
the food on Earth is wasted.

1:05:56.649 --> 1:05:59.084
Matt, I seriously doubt that.

1:05:59.184 --> 1:06:00.920
It was a pretty compelling
documentary.

1:06:01.019 --> 1:06:02.421
Yeah, well, so there's waste.

1:06:02.521 --> 1:06:04.232
That's just a by-product
of being able to produce

1:06:04.256 --> 1:06:05.725
whatever you want,
whenever you want.

1:06:05.825 --> 1:06:07.827
That is some free-market
bullshit and you know it.

1:06:07.927 --> 1:06:10.095
It's not free market!
I'm just being realistic.

1:06:10.195 --> 1:06:12.842
I'm not gonna fucking sit here and
have a conversation with you guys

1:06:12.866 --> 1:06:15.033
about some utopia that's
never gonna actually exist.

1:06:15.133 --> 1:06:17.102
You sound like
a fucking libertarian.

1:06:17.202 --> 1:06:18.872
So what if I am a libertarian?

1:06:18.972 --> 1:06:21.674
Libertarians are just hippies
that grew up and bought guns.

1:06:21.774 --> 1:06:23.943
Well, I'm glad you read
your first Noam Chomsky book

1:06:24.042 --> 1:06:27.112
and now you're an expert on
oversimplified global economics.

1:06:27.212 --> 1:06:29.014
Like, Jesus Christ,
you and Matt should make

1:06:29.114 --> 1:06:31.885
a really compelling
documentary about it.

1:06:31.985 --> 1:06:34.419
- That sounds cool.
- I don't think it's naïve

1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:36.320
to think that there could be
something better.

1:06:36.388 --> 1:06:39.358
Yeah, well, then show me system
that actually exists, you know,

1:06:39.458 --> 1:06:41.804
and we can sit here and have an
intelligent conversation about it.

1:06:41.828 --> 1:06:45.230
But until then, I'm gonna try to work
within the system that actually exists.

1:06:54.473 --> 1:06:55.775
What's your plan?

1:06:59.211 --> 1:07:00.379
This.

1:07:01.213 --> 1:07:02.715
No, like, your life plan.

1:07:04.182 --> 1:07:05.350
What do you mean?

1:07:06.686 --> 1:07:10.590
Like, if you could
wake up in 10 years,

1:07:10.690 --> 1:07:12.124
what would you be doing?

1:07:13.993 --> 1:07:17.262
I'd be here with you.

1:07:18.096 --> 1:07:20.465
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

1:07:25.672 --> 1:07:28.340
You never thought about
going back to school?

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:32.812
- I knew that bothered you.
- No, it doesn't.

1:07:37.382 --> 1:07:40.753
I'm just wondering
if you've ever thought

1:07:40.853 --> 1:07:43.923
about doing something else.

1:07:45.858 --> 1:07:47.827
Sam, I don't have what you have.

1:07:49.062 --> 1:07:54.132
For me, there's no special
gift or secret skill,

1:07:54.232 --> 1:07:56.936
but I'm happy here

1:07:57.036 --> 1:08:00.472
and I wanna share that
with someone.

1:08:12.351 --> 1:08:15.855
I don't understand why you can't
just tell your partner your number.

1:08:15.955 --> 1:08:17.857
They separate the numbers
at the beginning

1:08:17.957 --> 1:08:19.559
before she gets the first clue.

1:08:19.659 --> 1:08:22.494
You could definitely make up
signals, though, like...

1:08:24.496 --> 1:08:27.165
Very subtle, though.

1:08:27.265 --> 1:08:28.433
Wait.

1:08:29.902 --> 1:08:31.236
Ew.

1:08:31.336 --> 1:08:33.472
I got you some of that
non-dairy ice cream in there

1:08:33.573 --> 1:08:35.307
in case you want some.

1:08:35.407 --> 1:08:38.210
- I didn't even know that was a thing.
- Thank you.

1:08:43.348 --> 1:08:45.885
- Hello?
- <i>Samantha, it's your mother.</i>

1:08:45.985 --> 1:08:48.087
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>I was just thinking about you</i>

1:08:48.186 --> 1:08:49.822
<i>and wanted to see
how you're doing.</i>

1:08:49.922 --> 1:08:52.491
I'm good. I'm actually in the
middle of something right now.

1:08:52.592 --> 1:08:54.159
Can I call you back later?

1:08:54.259 --> 1:08:56.062
<i>Oh, real quick while I have you.</i>

1:08:56.161 --> 1:08:57.664
<i>What's the Wi-Fi password?</i>

1:08:57.764 --> 1:09:00.165
<i>Derek is trying to log in
with his laptop computer</i>

1:09:00.265 --> 1:09:01.668
<i>and I don't know the password.</i>

1:09:01.768 --> 1:09:04.202
- It's on the back of the router.
- <i>No, I already looked.</i>

1:09:04.302 --> 1:09:05.772
<i>It's not. Just give it to me.</i>

1:09:05.872 --> 1:09:10.109
- Okay, it's H-N-S-N...
- <i>Wait, hold on.</i>

1:09:10.208 --> 1:09:11.944
<i>Sweetie, I have the password.</i>

1:09:12.045 --> 1:09:13.613
<i>Okay, say it again.</i>

1:09:13.713 --> 1:09:16.415
H-N-S-N...

1:09:16.515 --> 1:09:18.751
<i>H-N-S-N.</i>

1:09:18.851 --> 1:09:23.321
- I-V-V-7.
- <i>I-V-V-7.</i>

1:09:25.524 --> 1:09:27.794
<i>No, that didn't work.
You must have said it wrong.</i>

1:09:27.894 --> 1:09:30.262
<i>Okay, say it again.
I'm going to write it down.</i>

1:09:30.362 --> 1:09:32.632
Okay, it's written on the
back of the router, though.

1:09:32.732 --> 1:09:34.734
<i>Okay, I'm ready, go ahead.</i>

1:09:34.834 --> 1:09:39.572
Okay, it's H-N-S,
"N" as in "Nancy,".

1:09:39.672 --> 1:09:43.375
I-V, "V" as in "Victoria," 7.

1:09:43.475 --> 1:09:45.678
<i>Okay, here, try this.</i>

1:09:47.180 --> 1:09:50.482
<i>Oh, good, he got the password
off the back of the router.</i>

1:09:50.583 --> 1:09:53.653
<i>When you're back, you should change
it to something easier to remember.</i>

1:09:53.753 --> 1:09:55.320
Okay.

1:09:55.420 --> 1:09:57.090
<i>Oh, I did want to make sure</i>

1:09:57.190 --> 1:09:59.224
<i>you're still helping with rent
this month.</i>

1:09:59.324 --> 1:10:02.294
<i>Derek's in between jobs,
so that would really help.</i>

1:10:02.394 --> 1:10:05.263
Yeah, okay. I gotta go.

1:10:26.085 --> 1:10:27.587
Oh, my God!

1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:30.823
I can't believe
you still have this.

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:33.726
She still runs good, too.

1:10:56.115 --> 1:10:58.383
I can't believe
you still have this.

1:10:58.483 --> 1:11:00.519
It wasn't mine to give away.

1:11:00.620 --> 1:11:04.289
Plus, I always kind of hope somehow
you might have use for it one day.

1:11:04.389 --> 1:11:07.492
Yeah, I still remember you
picking me up from school in it.

1:11:07.593 --> 1:11:09.595
Yeah, me too.

1:11:14.332 --> 1:11:16.035
Can I ask you something?

1:11:19.304 --> 1:11:20.438
Of course.

1:11:21.941 --> 1:11:23.876
How do you know
what the right thing to do is

1:11:23.976 --> 1:11:25.645
when it isn't clear?

1:11:26.679 --> 1:11:28.480
I'm the last person
who should be offering

1:11:28.581 --> 1:11:31.150
anyone advice, especially you.

1:11:32.484 --> 1:11:33.686
I'm serious.

1:11:35.755 --> 1:11:38.390
In the program, you know,
we have that prayer thing.

1:11:39.125 --> 1:11:40.425
Yeah.

1:11:40.525 --> 1:11:43.729
"Serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

1:11:43.830 --> 1:11:45.698
courage to change
the things I can,

1:11:45.798 --> 1:11:47.900
and wisdom to know
the difference."

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.703
It's a lot harder
than it sounds.

1:11:50.803 --> 1:11:54.540
But except that you can't
save anyone,

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:56.242
or fix anyone, or change anyone.

1:11:56.341 --> 1:11:58.343
That's where it all starts.

1:11:58.443 --> 1:12:01.346
That's where you stop thinking
you control that much

1:12:01.446 --> 1:12:03.549
and start to realize
how little you really do.

1:12:03.649 --> 1:12:05.218
Yeah, well, that's easy
for you to say.

1:12:05.318 --> 1:12:07.119
You're not responsible
for anybody.

1:12:07.220 --> 1:12:11.624
Believe me, my whole life
has been filled with mistakes,

1:12:11.724 --> 1:12:14.227
things that I'm still
trying to make amends for,

1:12:14.327 --> 1:12:16.796
but I can't be responsible
for anyone else's life,

1:12:16.896 --> 1:12:19.298
just like you can't be
responsible for your mom's.

1:12:19.397 --> 1:12:22.201
- Somebody had to be.
- When you take on the weight of someone else,

1:12:22.301 --> 1:12:25.271
it holds you back, and it cripples
them from growing themselves.

1:12:25.370 --> 1:12:28.040
Is that what you think
I'm doing, I'm crippling her?

1:12:30.076 --> 1:12:31.911
I think you have a big heart

1:12:32.011 --> 1:12:34.247
and you don't want her
to feel pain.

1:12:35.513 --> 1:12:38.284
But you can't do that forever.

1:12:38.383 --> 1:12:41.554
Right now, you need to do
what's best for you,

1:12:41.654 --> 1:12:44.489
not her or anyone else, you.

1:12:44.590 --> 1:12:45.791
So, is that what you did?

1:12:45.892 --> 1:12:47.727
You just did what was best
for you?

1:12:47.827 --> 1:12:50.963
Because you weren't around when
I was the one taking care of her

1:12:51.063 --> 1:12:53.431
and trying to put myself
through high school, okay.

1:12:53.532 --> 1:12:55.467
So you don't get
to write your letters,

1:12:55.568 --> 1:12:57.803
you don't get to call me
on my birthday,

1:12:57.904 --> 1:13:02.775
and you don't get to tell me this
bullshit 12-step speech, okay.

1:13:02.875 --> 1:13:05.044
It's too fucking late.

1:13:06.712 --> 1:13:09.982
All I know
is a person's life is defined

1:13:10.082 --> 1:13:13.152
by just a handful of choices.

1:13:13.252 --> 1:13:16.055
Yeah, well, you really missed
some of those, didn't you?

1:13:37.209 --> 1:13:39.312
Hey, look, it's Ansel Adams.

1:13:43.582 --> 1:13:46.484
- Cute pics here.
- Give me those.

1:13:47.286 --> 1:13:50.089
- Really edgy.
- I'm serious, give them to me.

1:13:50.890 --> 1:13:52.267
- What are you so upset about?
- Hey.

1:13:52.291 --> 1:13:53.659
Why does she have these?

1:13:53.759 --> 1:13:55.194
Al, give those back.

1:13:59.565 --> 1:14:01.834
- Fuck you!
- Hey.

1:14:01.934 --> 1:14:03.436
Hey, stop. What...

1:14:04.770 --> 1:14:07.649
I... you left those in the back of my
trunk and I thought it would be nice to...

1:14:07.673 --> 1:14:09.175
I didn't ask you to do that.

1:14:09.275 --> 1:14:11.119
I thought the whole point was
for people to see anyways.

1:14:11.143 --> 1:14:13.312
No, I don't need you
to do shit for me, all right.

1:14:13.412 --> 1:14:16.582
- I don't need you to fix me.
- That's not what I'm doing.

1:14:16.682 --> 1:14:18.551
Okay, so then what is it
that you're doing?

1:14:18.651 --> 1:14:19.919
What is this?

1:14:20.019 --> 1:14:22.588
I love you,
but you have to let me.

1:14:22.688 --> 1:14:25.424
- It's not that simple.
- Why?

1:14:25.523 --> 1:14:27.135
Why does it have to be
more complicated than that?

1:14:27.159 --> 1:14:29.695
Because this isn't a life, okay?

1:14:29.795 --> 1:14:32.098
It's cute,
but it's also pathetic.

1:14:32.198 --> 1:14:35.334
I'm fucked up, but at least
I live in the real fucking world

1:14:35.434 --> 1:14:37.103
where people don't grow up
to be painters

1:14:37.203 --> 1:14:40.072
and rock stars
and drink wine all day.

1:14:43.609 --> 1:14:45.344
I think you should go.

1:15:30.423 --> 1:15:33.092
Hello?

1:15:33.192 --> 1:15:35.161
Mom? Is that you?

1:15:35.261 --> 1:15:38.397
- Is everything okay?
- <i>I'm okay.</i>

1:15:38.497 --> 1:15:41.967
- Mom, what's wrong?
- <i>He... he left.</i>

1:15:42.068 --> 1:15:43.769
- Who left?
- <i>Derek.</i>

1:15:43.869 --> 1:15:45.504
<i>Derek left just now.</i>

1:15:45.604 --> 1:15:47.573
What do you mean he left?
He just moved in.

1:15:47.673 --> 1:15:49.108
<i>He said I was weak</i>

1:15:49.208 --> 1:15:51.644
<i>and that this just wasn't
working out for him.</i>

1:15:51.744 --> 1:15:54.113
<i>Then I got upset and he told
me there was another woman,</i>

1:15:54.213 --> 1:15:56.782
<i>Lisa, who he had ended
things with a few months ago</i>

1:15:56.882 --> 1:15:59.985
<i>but he said he loved her and wanted
to be with her instead of me.</i>

1:16:00.086 --> 1:16:02.755
<i>So he's gone, and I'm alone,
and I need you to come back</i>

1:16:02.855 --> 1:16:05.257
- <i>and take care of me, Samantha.</i>
- Mom...

1:16:06.625 --> 1:16:07.960
Okay, just listen to me.

1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:10.963
Just take a shower,
get something to eat.

1:16:11.063 --> 1:16:12.131
Okay? Breathe.

1:16:12.231 --> 1:16:13.966
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:16:14.066 --> 1:16:15.835
<i>I need you here.</i>

1:16:36.590 --> 1:16:38.424
Thought you'd want
to have these.

1:16:41.260 --> 1:16:43.295
Sorry for being an asshole.

1:16:45.565 --> 1:16:46.632
Thanks.

1:16:47.433 --> 1:16:48.868
I was just playing around.

1:16:50.169 --> 1:16:51.538
I know.

1:16:51.637 --> 1:16:52.972
I'm just going through a lot,

1:16:53.072 --> 1:16:55.207
and I definitely
took it out on you.

1:16:56.308 --> 1:16:58.711
This is just the first place
that's ever felt like home,

1:16:58.811 --> 1:17:00.980
so I got really protective.

1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:02.815
Taylor is like a brother to me.

1:17:05.518 --> 1:17:07.686
I just don't wanna
hurt him, you know.

1:17:07.786 --> 1:17:09.355
And I definitely did.

1:17:13.627 --> 1:17:15.161
I think I'm just scared.

1:17:17.696 --> 1:17:19.064
What are you scared of?

1:17:21.267 --> 1:17:22.701
Relationships.

1:17:24.803 --> 1:17:28.140
Getting close to somebody,
them leaving.

1:17:29.441 --> 1:17:31.810
I don't know,
just all of it, I guess.

1:17:33.312 --> 1:17:36.081
I think you're a good person
and you'll figure it out.

1:17:37.516 --> 1:17:39.251
But what the fuck do I know?

1:17:45.457 --> 1:17:48.227
I'm not really
into that type of stuff,

1:17:48.327 --> 1:17:50.396
but those photos
are pretty cool.

1:17:51.363 --> 1:17:52.498
Thanks.

1:18:12.251 --> 1:18:14.787
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:18:14.887 --> 1:18:16.455
What are you doing in the rain?

1:18:17.389 --> 1:18:19.158
I don't mind it.

1:18:19.258 --> 1:18:20.960
Just taking a break.

1:18:28.767 --> 1:18:31.638
I'm sorry for everything
that I said.

1:18:31.737 --> 1:18:33.973
I didn't mean it.

1:18:34.073 --> 1:18:35.474
Yeah, I know.

1:18:37.343 --> 1:18:38.944
It's just that...

1:18:41.347 --> 1:18:44.516
nobody's ever
really looked at me

1:18:44.618 --> 1:18:46.285
the way that you do.

1:18:47.753 --> 1:18:52.057
Or cared about me
the way that you do.

1:18:53.192 --> 1:18:54.760
I do care.

1:18:59.566 --> 1:19:01.066
I can't stay here.

1:19:03.603 --> 1:19:05.404
Yeah, you made that
pretty clear.

1:19:09.275 --> 1:19:11.110
My mom wants me to come home.

1:19:13.045 --> 1:19:14.581
What do you want?

1:19:18.884 --> 1:19:20.119
I don't know.

Took her out this morning.

1:22:23.837 --> 1:22:25.337
Running fine.

1:22:25.437 --> 1:22:28.407
Put in new oil
and topped out the fluids.

1:22:28.507 --> 1:22:31.343
Steering was drifting a little to the
left, but should be centered now.

1:22:31.443 --> 1:22:32.679
I put some oil in the trunk.

1:22:32.779 --> 1:22:34.155
It doesn't have a leak,
but just in case...

1:22:34.179 --> 1:22:35.481
Okay, I got it.

1:22:38.618 --> 1:22:40.787
There's a map in the glove box.

1:22:40.887 --> 1:22:44.122
It's prettier route
if you take 26 down to 97.

1:22:45.290 --> 1:22:46.726
Thank you.

1:22:49.027 --> 1:22:51.764
You should stop and see
San Francisco on the way down.

1:22:51.865 --> 1:22:54.366
That's the farthest south
I ever went.

1:22:54.466 --> 1:22:57.904
Everything below that,
you'll have to tell me about, okay?

1:23:07.614 --> 1:23:09.649
No, I can't.
That's too unpretty.

1:23:11.283 --> 1:23:13.051
Guys, come on.

1:23:13.151 --> 1:23:15.087
We're taking a photo.

1:23:15.187 --> 1:23:18.423
I mean,
weddings are open... weddings are open bar!

1:23:18.524 --> 1:23:20.502
- I need to take another.
- I wasn't even ready for that.

1:23:20.526 --> 1:23:22.729
Yeah, I wasn't ready either.

1:23:22.829 --> 1:23:25.006
- Samantha Rose, let us know, please.
- Give us a countdown.

1:23:25.030 --> 1:23:29.536
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Three, two, one.

1:23:30.870 --> 1:23:32.572
Nice.
That was fucking beautiful.

1:23:32.672 --> 1:23:34.273
- Right, yeah.
- All right, guys, wait.

1:23:34.373 --> 1:23:36.074
I have a surprise for you.
Follow me.

1:23:36.174 --> 1:23:37.710
- What is it?
- What is it?

1:23:37.810 --> 1:23:40.112
- God.
- Hmm, let's see.

1:23:40.212 --> 1:23:41.714
Taking us into the woods?

1:23:41.814 --> 1:23:44.584
- He's taking us to prom!
- Oh, my God!

1:23:45.417 --> 1:23:48.053
- It's time.
- Oh, my God, Vil.

1:23:48.153 --> 1:23:50.088
- No way.
- Allie, for you, obviously.

1:23:50.188 --> 1:23:51.399
- Thank you, sir.
- Is this your wine?

1:23:51.423 --> 1:23:53.726
You bet your ass.

1:23:53.826 --> 1:23:57.062
- Matt. Lu.
- Thank you.

1:23:57.162 --> 1:24:01.366
- Water for Sam.
- All jokes aside, pretty excited.

1:24:02.535 --> 1:24:05.905
To friends, to family.

1:24:06.005 --> 1:24:09.107
Cheers.

1:24:09.207 --> 1:24:12.545
Remember... swish, smell, sip.

1:24:14.847 --> 1:24:17.050
Ah.

1:24:17.617 --> 1:24:19.284
That is rich.

1:24:23.923 --> 1:24:26.593
- That is... that is terrible.
- Tastes like fucking poison.

1:24:26.693 --> 1:24:28.236
- It's the worst thing I've ever tasted.
- Oh, my God.

1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:30.063
My tongue is numb.

1:24:30.930 --> 1:24:32.197
Sorry about that, guys.

1:24:32.297 --> 1:24:34.033
But you're gonna
get it next time.

1:24:34.132 --> 1:24:36.268
- All jokes aside.
- We'll see.

1:24:36.368 --> 1:24:39.137
Sam, I drew this for you.

1:24:41.708 --> 1:24:44.109
- Thanks.
- Did you give a gift?

1:24:44.209 --> 1:24:47.279
- I think it's brave what you're doing.
- Yeah.

1:24:47.379 --> 1:24:49.549
- Thanks.
- I can't believe it was that bad.

1:24:49.649 --> 1:24:51.216
It wasn't that bad.

1:24:51.316 --> 1:24:54.721
Also, I didn't...
I didn't realize that we were doing gifts.

1:24:54.821 --> 1:24:56.288
She did. Eh, it doesn't matter.

1:24:56.388 --> 1:24:59.291
But I'm happy to send you
my new song when it's done.

1:24:59.391 --> 1:25:00.693
I'd like that.

1:25:01.828 --> 1:25:04.129
- It's gonna be rough now.
- Probably will be.

1:25:04.229 --> 1:25:06.566
Don't worry. Love you, kid.

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:08.500
Make better wine.

1:25:08.601 --> 1:25:10.003
I'll try.

1:25:12.572 --> 1:25:14.506
Yeah, we don't have to hug.
It's okay.

1:25:17.342 --> 1:25:18.778
Um, take care of them.

1:25:19.679 --> 1:25:22.381
Yeah, I'll make sure there's
no skanky bitches around here.

1:25:30.690 --> 1:25:33.126
So, I heard they closed
all the roads out of here.

1:25:34.594 --> 1:25:36.696
Wow, all of them?

1:25:36.796 --> 1:25:39.032
Yeah, they're saying
it's gonna be a while.

1:25:41.801 --> 1:25:44.070
Are you sure
I can't change your mind?

1:25:46.039 --> 1:25:47.707
I think I'm in love with you...

1:25:49.842 --> 1:25:51.878
but I need to be sure.

1:25:52.879 --> 1:25:56.716
And if I don't
do this now, I... I won't.

1:25:58.151 --> 1:25:59.752
Don't say that.

1:25:59.852 --> 1:26:02.254
Some shit you say
at the end of things, you know.

1:26:09.896 --> 1:26:11.531
I promise I'll write.

1:26:26.079 --> 1:26:28.014
I hope you found
what you're looking for.

1:26:49.535 --> 1:26:50.570
<i>Hi, it's Diane.</i>

1:26:50.670 --> 1:26:52.004
<i>I can't get the phone right now.</i>

1:26:52.105 --> 1:26:54.073
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

1:26:54.173 --> 1:26:56.542
Hi, Mom, it's me.

1:26:58.711 --> 1:26:59.879
<i>Um...</i>

1:27:01.013 --> 1:27:02.882
<i>I can't come back there
right now.</i>

1:27:07.285 --> 1:27:10.489
<i>For so long, I think
I've been trying to save you</i>

1:27:10.590 --> 1:27:12.825
<i>but you don't need any saving.</i>

1:27:14.961 --> 1:27:17.930
<i>You're a good person
and you're gonna be fine.</i>

1:27:20.066 --> 1:27:22.467
<i>I just need to figure out
what's next for me.</i>

1:27:24.103 --> 1:27:26.839
<i>I'll get a new phone and I'll
call you once I get there.</i>

1:27:28.306 --> 1:27:30.777
<i>Don't forget to eat
and to get outside.</i>

1:27:32.377 --> 1:27:35.815
<i>And if Derek calls again,
tell him to fuck off.</i>

1:27:35.915 --> 1:27:37.650
<i>You deserve better than that.</i>

1:27:39.719 --> 1:27:40.953
I love you.

1:27:42.622 --> 1:27:43.790
Okay.

1:28:53.893 --> 1:28:57.763
It's like a dating app,
except it's for finding friends.

1:28:57.864 --> 1:29:00.266
<i>How does it pick the
people it matches you with?</i>

1:29:00.365 --> 1:29:02.405
You fill out a questionnaire
and then they match you

1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:04.971
with the people that you have
the most shared interests with.

1:29:05.071 --> 1:29:07.073
<i>God, that sounds awful.</i>

1:29:11.509 --> 1:29:12.612
I miss you.

1:29:13.846 --> 1:29:15.281
<i>You're just lonely.</i>

1:29:15.380 --> 1:29:17.083
<i>That's not the same thing.</i>

1:29:18.383 --> 1:29:19.986
No.

1:29:20.086 --> 1:29:22.255
I miss you.
