00:10.333 --> 00:12.083
Oh. Chase.

00:12.166 --> 00:13.583
Just want to thank you again

00:13.667 --> 00:15.375
for bringing me on board
your new company.

00:15.458 --> 00:17.375
Oh, Greg, I never forget
my hardest-working employees.

00:17.458 --> 00:19.500
And you were the only one
who wasn't taken down

00:19.583 --> 00:21.208
by a feminist blog.

00:21.291 --> 00:22.917
This Spotz app is genius.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.291
I mean,
Airbnb for your driveway.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.500
How many times have I looked
at my driveway and thought,

00:28.583 --> 00:30.208
"How can I make money
off of you?"

00:30.291 --> 00:31.625
Not once, you know,

00:31.709 --> 00:33.667
which is why I didn't think
of this.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.166
Well, thinking of apps

00:35.250 --> 00:37.417
and standing to pee

00:35.250 --> 00:37.417
is a young man's game.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.250
Okay. Well,

00:37.500 --> 00:40.250
I'll write that down.

00:40.333 --> 00:41.417
Greg, meet the team.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.500
This is Austin.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.500
You probably know her

00:43.583 --> 00:45.375
from her gamertag,

00:43.583 --> 00:45.375
PookieGunner.

-Oh! (laughs)

00:54.750 --> 00:57.041
Booger,

00:54.750 --> 00:57.041
like <i>Revenge of the Nerds.</i>

00:57.125 --> 00:59.250
I don't know that podcast.

00:59.333 --> 01:02.083
No, it's a movie. I-I'll bring

00:59.333 --> 01:02.083
in a DVD for you sometime.

01:03.542 --> 01:06.375
So you can rip it onto a link.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.291
SoundCloud.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.500
(laughs)

01:10.583 --> 01:11.834
Okay, guys, tell you what.

01:11.917 --> 01:13.959
Why don't you put him

01:11.917 --> 01:13.959
on the group text

01:14.041 --> 01:15.542
and bring him up to speed.

01:15.625 --> 01:16.917
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:17.000 --> 01:19.500
I have to go sit down

01:17.000 --> 01:19.500
and take a pee.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.542
What's up, Mario Van Peoples?

01:24.625 --> 01:26.291
Feeling some donuts?

Compliments of DJGreg420WhuWhu.

(phones chime)

01:32.041 --> 01:33.667
(laughter)

01:35.000 --> 01:36.667
We're off gluten.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.166
Maybe I can return these.

01:41.166 --> 01:44.583
Oh, Jen, it's the worst.

01:41.166 --> 01:44.583
Everyone hates me.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.709
I can't fit in. I just...

01:46.792 --> 01:50.041
I'm sorry. I just needed

01:46.792 --> 01:50.041
to hear a friendly voice.

01:50.125 --> 01:51.667
Your mom didn't pick up, huh?

01:51.750 --> 01:53.083
No, she didn't.

01:53.166 --> 01:55.000
<i>You know, I mean,</i>

01:55.083 --> 01:57.208
they all have

01:55.083 --> 01:57.208
these inside jokes.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.125
I mean, I'm-I'm looking

01:57.291 --> 01:59.125
at the bathroom wall.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.417
It's covered in graffiti

02:00.500 --> 02:01.917
where they make fun

02:00.500 --> 02:01.917
of each other.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.125
You know, "Jay is gross."

02:04.208 --> 02:05.917
"Pat smells his wipes."

02:06.000 --> 02:08.500
<i>"Jacob doesn't recycle."</i>

02:06.000 --> 02:08.500
<i>I mean...</i>

02:08.583 --> 02:11.041
Nothing about old Greg.

02:11.125 --> 02:12.834
You're not eating

02:11.125 --> 02:12.834
in the bathroom, are you?

02:12.917 --> 02:14.709
What? No way.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.959
(mouth full):

02:14.792 --> 02:16.959
You know, I'm really thinking

02:17.041 --> 02:19.083
it was a mistake

02:17.041 --> 02:19.083
taking this job.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.458
Oh, honey, don't worry about it.

02:20.542 --> 02:22.208
You'll figure out

02:20.542 --> 02:22.208
how to speak their language.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.041
Yeah, but how do I do that?

02:24.125 --> 02:26.625
Well, you're eating

02:24.125 --> 02:26.625
in the bathroom

02:26.709 --> 02:30.458
while talking to your wife,

02:26.709 --> 02:30.458
so maybe start with not that.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.375
(sighs)

02:46.625 --> 02:48.291
(laughs)

02:48.375 --> 02:51.792
I saw what you jokesters wrote
in the bathroom about me.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.458
(scoffs) Classic.

02:53.542 --> 02:57.000
Hey! Listen up, everybody.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.500
Emergency meeting,
my office, right now.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.875
Angry face emoji.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.959
There's some serious stuff
happening in the bathroom.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.625
More serious than when
Larry hung himself in there?

03:10.709 --> 03:12.125
That was bad.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.125
Or when Andrea
had her baby in there?

03:14.208 --> 03:15.250
Ooh, that was bad, too,

03:15.333 --> 03:16.959
but this is worse.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.834
Whoever wrote that about Greg
crossed the line.

03:19.917 --> 03:22.458
Oh, oh, i-it's fine.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.125
I mean, really, it's...

03:24.208 --> 03:26.792
Got to have a-a thick
skin if you're gonna

03:26.875 --> 03:28.542
be in the Spotz gang.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.125
Isn't that right,
PookieHunterGamer?

03:32.208 --> 03:34.083
PookieGunner.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.500
I was close.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.458
Death threats,
hate speech, body shaming,

03:38.542 --> 03:40.417
all in one horrible scribble?

03:40.500 --> 03:42.125
It's not okay.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.667
Talking about...

03:43.750 --> 03:46.667
that area? Not okay.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.000
Pointing out this?

03:48.083 --> 03:49.875
Not okay.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.208
Why don't we talk
about what's up here

03:52.291 --> 03:54.166
or what's in here.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.750
Okay, if you're a woman,

03:55.834 --> 03:58.750
I guess let's just stick
to what's up here.

03:58.834 --> 04:01.208
That's a beautiful blouse,
by the way.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.583
So, who was it?

04:04.667 --> 04:06.000
Okay.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.917
If you're not man enough to...

04:08.000 --> 04:10.166
Can't say that.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.917
If you don't have the balls
to tell me that it was you,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.625
then we're just gonna
get a handwriting analysis

04:16.709 --> 04:18.542
and find out the culprit
that way.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.166
When I find out who did

04:20.250 --> 04:21.500
the crime in the bathroom,

04:21.583 --> 04:23.750
they will be terminated
and prosecuted.

04:23.834 --> 04:25.041
(workers murmuring)

04:25.125 --> 04:27.083
Greg, what are you doing?

04:27.166 --> 04:29.417
I don't know.
I was just trying to fit in.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.166
That's, like, the definition

04:31.250 --> 04:33.041
of creating
a hostile work environment.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.750
Why would you write that?

04:34.834 --> 04:37.333
Matt used to say it to me
all the time when we were kids.

04:37.417 --> 04:38.875
I knew I should've gone with

04:38.959 --> 04:41.333
his other insult,
"Greg is adopted."

04:41.417 --> 04:43.875
You know, but we have
this Russian kid there,

04:43.959 --> 04:46.542
and he has two dads, so it felt
kind of risky, you know?

04:46.625 --> 04:47.750
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.917
When I said to learn
to speak their language,

04:50.000 --> 04:51.959
I meant, like, buy a hat.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.875
I did buy a hat.
You threw it away.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.250
Well, it was a stupid hat.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.750
Chase, uh...

05:00.834 --> 05:03.000
I'm sorry, but we need to talk

05:03.083 --> 05:05.709
about what was written
in the bathroom.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.417
I know, buddy. Have a seat.

05:10.458 --> 05:13.333
I just got off the phone with
my entire board of directors.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.291
I'm out. They suspended me.

05:15.375 --> 05:18.625
W-Why? I mean, you didn't write
that stuff in the bathroom.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.500
I assume.

05:20.583 --> 05:23.333
No way to tell. I wasn't allowed
to analyze the handwriting.

05:23.417 --> 05:24.959
The board feels
that I've created

05:25.041 --> 05:28.291
a toxic work environment,
and I have to agree.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.500
You know how many times
I've gone home crying

05:30.583 --> 05:32.542
after someone wrote
something horrible about me?

05:32.625 --> 05:35.250
Yeah, yeah, I read that thing
about your man boobs.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.250
But if it makes you feel
any better,

05:37.333 --> 05:39.208
I did not notice
until I read it.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.709
You're a good guy, Greg.

05:40.792 --> 05:43.250
That's why the board
wants you to take over.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.792
What? Me?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.500
Hey, boss man. How's work?

05:51.583 --> 05:53.500
<i>Those teenagers</i>
<i>still being mean to you?</i>

05:53.583 --> 05:55.083
Well, you tell me.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.125
Listen to what my team
wrote about me

05:57.208 --> 05:58.625
on the bathroom wall.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.834
"Must be nice to be an old loser

06:00.917 --> 06:03.667
who gets promoted
after two days." (chuckles)

06:03.750 --> 06:05.291
I'm finally fitting in.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.709
Oh, wow.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.208
Life has a funny way
of working out.

06:09.291 --> 06:12.417
Hey, uh, any luck
getting rid of what you wrote?

06:12.500 --> 06:15.709
No, they told me
they're gonna have to retile.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.792
Guess I shouldn't
have written it so big.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.291
(gasps)

06:28.375 --> 06:32.125
ALL:
Aw!

06:32.208 --> 06:35.458
Jen, you wretched thing,
how am I supposed to handle

06:35.542 --> 06:37.542
that adorable dress?

06:37.625 --> 06:40.959
I mean, just kill me.
Just end it all now.

06:41.041 --> 06:42.834
JEN:
Lark, what do you say?

06:42.917 --> 06:44.500
Thank you, Easter Bunny.

06:44.583 --> 06:46.250
-Aw.
-Thank you... Oh.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.333
-She thinks I'm
the Easter Bunny.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.333
-(laughter)

06:48.417 --> 06:51.083
We are doing such a good job.

06:52.417 --> 06:55.458
Isn't this just
a little sanctimonious?

06:55.542 --> 06:59.333
Uh... maybe.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.792
(aahing, laughter)

07:01.875 --> 07:04.750
I got to trade my kids in
for a new model.

07:04.834 --> 07:07.625
Someone got resurrected today,
and we're just sitting here

07:07.709 --> 07:11.417
obsessing over the third most
boring person in our family.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.709
Who are the first two...

07:12.792 --> 07:15.250
No offense, you guys.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.375
Hungwy.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.583
Are you speaking Korean?

07:20.667 --> 07:22.583
I thought you and Sung-sook
had a falling out.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.333
Me want p'sghetti.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.000
Okay, honey, I don't
know what you're doing,

07:26.083 --> 07:27.917
but I assume that
you're making fun of me

07:28.000 --> 07:30.375
in some sort of complicated
way that I don't understand.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.166
So no TV for you tonight, okay?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.458
Uh...

07:33.542 --> 07:36.041
You have no idea
how much I enjoyed that.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.625
It's your second helping,
so I'm guessing a lot.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.208
I meant your desperation.
I think you need to start

07:41.291 --> 07:43.542
wetting your pants again
to really sell it.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:45.583 --> 07:49.709
(chuckles softly) You forget,
I was the cute one before you.

07:49.792 --> 07:52.458
Then some thing
clawed its way out of Mom,

07:52.542 --> 07:54.500
turned the family
into a Sophia cult.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.542
Well, that'll never happen
with Lark and me.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.166
She's so stale.

07:58.250 --> 08:01.166
She's like if two blah
white people had a baby.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.041
Hey, babe, you know what I love?

08:03.125 --> 08:05.875
-Quinoa?
-Yeah.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.834
Don't worry,
Clementine and Tyler

08:07.917 --> 08:09.750
won't go five years
without getting pregnant.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.083
And Lark'll be out
on her ass, too.

08:14.792 --> 08:17.125
JOAN:
Oh, I can't!

08:17.208 --> 08:20.500
I can't live on a planet
this adorable!

08:20.583 --> 08:23.834
Just weigh me down
and throw me in the river!

08:23.917 --> 08:26.417
Mine's twirlier.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.458
Okay. Sophie, stop it. You look
like you're tripping on acid.

08:30.542 --> 08:33.000
You want to know what?
What if we just, um...

08:33.083 --> 08:34.041
-Oh.
-Here you go.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.959
-JOAN: Oh...
-Oh. Good?

08:37.041 --> 08:38.417
...my!

08:38.500 --> 08:41.208
Just decapitate me!

08:41.291 --> 08:42.834
(quietly):
These are empty threats, right?

08:42.917 --> 08:44.458
-(camera clicking)
-Hey, uh, Sophia,

08:44.542 --> 08:47.333
can-can you move
a little bit, please?

08:47.417 --> 08:49.625
No, no, no. Other way.
You're in the frame.

08:49.709 --> 08:51.875
There you go. Yeah, keep going.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.291
A little more.
Bucket's still in.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.375
Bucket's still in. There we go.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.667
All right, Lark. Smile. Perfect.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.000
JOHN:
I want a copy of that.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.417
I'm gonna tape it
on my computer

09:02.500 --> 09:04.208
as my new screen saver.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.208
Happy Easter, everyone.

09:06.291 --> 09:08.500
It's time for our under-fives

09:08.583 --> 09:11.709
to get ready for the egg hunt!

09:11.792 --> 09:13.125
You hear that, Lark?

09:13.208 --> 09:14.959
You gonna win the egg hunt,
like we said?

09:15.041 --> 09:17.208
I will win that the most!

09:17.291 --> 09:19.000
-Really cute.
-(sighs)

09:19.083 --> 09:21.583
-Right, Sophia?
-Shut it, Samantha.

09:21.667 --> 09:25.959
Ready, set, and go!

09:26.041 --> 09:27.542
GREG:
Lark. Larkie.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.291
Go get that big blue egg.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.417
Yeah!

09:30.500 --> 09:31.750
-Oh, look at her.
-Oh, look at her.

09:31.834 --> 09:32.792
GREG:
To the right, Lark,

09:31.834 --> 09:32.792
to the right.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.250
-Oh, no. Not the rock.
-JEN: Aw.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.083
Well, you know,
she probably felt bad

09:37.166 --> 09:39.458
that the rock wasn't
getting any attention.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.583
SOPHIA:
She doesn't even know

09:39.542 --> 09:41.583
her colors.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.750
Or left from right.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.917
Sophia, what are you doing?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.834
You snooze, you lose.

09:47.917 --> 09:50.125
Sophia.
Those aren't for you!

09:50.208 --> 09:51.500
-What on earth?
-What the...?

09:51.583 --> 09:53.125
No!

09:53.208 --> 09:55.041
Wh-What's that young lady doing?

09:56.917 --> 09:58.917
Where are her parents?

10:00.250 --> 10:02.125
JOAN:
Honey. Please.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.583
Don't do that.

10:03.667 --> 10:04.917
Okay, what do we do?

10:05.041 --> 10:07.166
-I think we just do
the right thing.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.166
-Yeah.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.792
Whose monster child is this?

10:08.875 --> 10:12.083
Yeah! Get that girl
off the field, huh?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.250
SAMANTHA:
Careful.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.709
Those'll mess you up.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.583
My tolerance is off the charts
at this point.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.208
I don't even feel it.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.542
You sure showed
those three-year-olds.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.959
Their parents are
calling you Godzilla.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.041
I'm not proud
I destroyed Tokyo, okay?

10:32.125 --> 10:34.750
So if you're here
to make fun of me,

10:34.834 --> 10:37.542
why don't you just go
somewhere and have puberty.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.375
I'm not gonna make fun of you.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.041
Mom and Dad wanted me
to give you this.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.542
Ten bucks? Why?

10:45.625 --> 10:47.709
They said it's only half
of what's yours

10:47.792 --> 10:50.834
if you don't call them Mom
and Dad till we leave the park.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.083
Fine by me.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.083
Hey, life isn't over

10:55.166 --> 10:57.583
because you aren't
the cute one anymore.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.125
This just means
it's time to reinvent yourself.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.667
Find a new thing.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.041
Uh, but don't sulk.
That's my thing.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
-Give me one of those.
-Okay.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.709
Okay, ready?

11:18.166 --> 11:19.792
(chuckles)

11:22.834 --> 11:24.667
-What are you doing?
-Gotcha!

11:24.750 --> 11:26.625
(chuckles)
I'm a practical jokester now.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.458
You been Soph'd!

11:28.542 --> 11:30.917
Okay, well, just clean all this
up when you're done, all right?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.041
Ketchup stains.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.917
(sighs) Maybe keep trying.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.500
Hey, John.

11:44.583 --> 11:47.125
Hey! I didn't recognize you
without my son.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.959
Do you want some breakfast?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.750
Uh... well, it's 5:00.

11:51.834 --> 11:55.083
Oh? Well, I'm going back to bed.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.583
JOAN:
Who's in here?

11:56.667 --> 11:58.917
Who is in here? Say hi to Mommy!

11:59.000 --> 12:01.208
-(Joan imitates sputtering car)
-Wow.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.375
Looks like you two had some fun.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.709
I made Cheeto my baby.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.500
Is he in diapers?

12:07.583 --> 12:09.917
That's crazy. He's 49.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.375
JEN:
You know what, sweetie?

12:11.458 --> 12:12.917
I love his beautiful necklace,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.917
but it looks very fancy,
so I think

12:15.000 --> 12:17.542
we should just take it off
and give it back to Mom-Mom.

12:17.625 --> 12:20.625
Jen, if you like the necklace,
why don't you keep it?

12:20.709 --> 12:23.250
Oh, no. No, no.
I couldn't take your necklace.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.792
Sure you can.
I never wear it.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.625
And I'd love for you
to have something of mine.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.625
It'd make me so happy

12:30.709 --> 12:33.417
to see you enjoy it while
I still have half a brain.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.250
(laughs)

12:35.333 --> 12:38.125
Joanie, what is that,
face crabs?

12:38.208 --> 12:40.583
Hurry, hurry

12:40.667 --> 12:43.125
while there's still
some of my quiche left.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.750
I made it with marshmallow,
so it's both savory and sweet.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.041
-Mmm.
-Mmm. Yum. Best of both worlds.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.959
You know what? I'm just so full.
Couldn't eat another bite.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.291
(both laugh)

12:53.375 --> 12:55.291
Oh, you're wearing the necklace?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.000
It looks beautiful on you.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.792
Oh, thank you. I love it.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.959
I haven't taken it off.
(laughs)

13:02.041 --> 13:03.583
Here, let me help you.

13:03.667 --> 13:04.959
Oh, thank you.

13:05.041 --> 13:07.583
I'll owe you big

13:07.667 --> 13:11.083
if you can throw out Colleen's
quiche without her seeing it.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.792
Yeah, yeah, I think I'll
throw it in the trash, though,

13:13.875 --> 13:15.834
'cause the last one broke
the garbage disposal.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.750
-Oh, my gosh, that's right.
-Ooh, yeah.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.500
Oh, hey,

13:21.583 --> 13:23.542
how does your mom feel
about getting naked?

13:23.625 --> 13:25.917
-Hmm?
-I was thinking about taking her

13:23.625 --> 13:25.917
to the Korean spa.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.083
Oh, she loves being naked,
like, too much.

13:28.166 --> 13:32.000
Like, my entire childhood
felt like one big Cinemax movie.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.500
Wow.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.250
Where'd you get that necklace?

13:35.333 --> 13:36.792
Oh, your mom gave it to me.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.500
-Isn't it gorgeous?
-Oh. Yeah.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.625
-Thanks.
-That's nice. I'm glad

13:38.583 --> 13:40.625
she decided

13:40.709 --> 13:42.041
to keep it in the family.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.750
Will you excuse me
for one second?

13:44.834 --> 13:47.834
I just can't get enough
of this quiche, Colleen!

13:47.917 --> 13:49.750
COLLEEN:
I knew you'd like it!

13:51.000 --> 13:53.583
Mom, how could you
give Jen my necklace?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.083
You and Dad gave it to me
when I was 16.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.542
Oh, no. We did, didn't we?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.500
For not getting pregnant.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.834
No, you gave me the Celica
for not getting pregnant.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.667
The necklace
you gave me for my birthday.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.166
I thought that I lost it.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.667
You're gonna have to go
get that back.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.291
Oh, this is terrible.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.709
Don't beat yourself up, Mom.
It's okay. I forgive you.

14:11.792 --> 14:14.041
No, it's just
Jen loves the necklace

14:14.125 --> 14:15.542
and it's brought us closer,

14:15.625 --> 14:18.500
and I don't know
how I can ask for it back.

14:18.583 --> 14:21.917
Well, I think the same way that
you asked for my Celica back

14:22.000 --> 14:23.834
when I did get pregnant.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.291
(sighs)

14:25.375 --> 14:27.750
(knocking)

14:27.834 --> 14:29.375
JOAN:
Hello, Jen!

14:29.458 --> 14:33.250
-Hi.
-Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

14:33.333 --> 14:36.375
I-I just wanted to return
your pie plate from brunch.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.291
Oh, you didn't have to do that,

14:38.375 --> 14:40.542
especially because
it's not mine.

14:40.625 --> 14:42.792
Oh. Well, I-I have to go
to the bathroom.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.375
Would you excuse me?

14:48.625 --> 14:53.041
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.000
(clicks tongue) Uh, Joan?

14:55.083 --> 14:56.375
(gasps)

14:56.458 --> 14:57.500
I lied.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.500
I didn't have to go
to the bathroom.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.417
I always go
before I leave the house.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.417
Yeah. It troubles me
that I know that about you.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.667
I was looking for the necklace
I gave you.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.959
It's Heather's.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.709
Oh.

15:09.792 --> 15:13.166
Oh, that's why she was staring
at my chest all morning.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.542
I had completely forgotten.
I'm so sorry.

15:16.625 --> 15:21.041
I was gonna replace it with

15:16.625 --> 15:21.041
this replica that John made.

15:21.125 --> 15:24.834
Yeah, that-that looks like
a marble on some fishing line.

15:24.917 --> 15:28.458
Yeah, I knew you'd know,
but he had me convinced, and...

15:28.542 --> 15:30.458
It's-it's okay. Really.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.375
It still means a lot

15:32.458 --> 15:33.542
that you wanted
to give it to me.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.667
It made me feel like a daughter.

15:35.750 --> 15:39.250
(chuckles) Which makes sense,
because it is your daughter's.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.417
You know, my son is so lucky.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.166
I don't know what
he's always complaining about.

15:44.250 --> 15:47.667
So you're saying
he-he complains about me?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.834
Here it is, dear.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.917
Oh, Mom,
you didn't have to do that.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.542
You told me I did.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.125
And then Tim called
and said I'd better.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.709
And then the kids called
and threatened me.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.583
Oh. Did they?

16:04.667 --> 16:06.291
-Yeah.
-Aw.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.959
I hope Jen wasn't too upset.

16:08.041 --> 16:11.125
No, she was very mature and
understanding-- elegant, even.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.458
Which is why I gave her
those little earrings,

16:13.542 --> 16:15.291
you know, the lotus flowers.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.875
The-the ones that you got me
for my high school graduation.

16:18.959 --> 16:20.583
Oh, no.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.667
I just think it's really weird
to stab somebody that you love.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.750
Is this really the only way
we can do IVF?

16:30.834 --> 16:32.917
Yes, babe. And you have
to get used to it,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.917
because we have to do it
every day.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.125
Hormones are not
the kind of thing

16:36.208 --> 16:37.709
you can wrap in peanut butter
and swallow.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.000
I asked.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.500
Okay, this is just really hard
for me, you know?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.834
-Yeah.
-Because I'm really scared

16:41.583 --> 16:43.834
of needles.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.375
(inhales sharply)
Just do it.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.250
-Okay.
-No, wait, I'm not ready.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.166
-(exhales)
-Just do it.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.250
-I'm not ready.
-(grunts)

16:50.333 --> 16:52.834
-(shouting)
-Oh, s...

16:53.875 --> 16:55.083
Hi!

16:55.166 --> 16:57.166
Hey!
Who's ready to do some shots?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.583
(chuckles)

16:58.667 --> 17:01.083
I really appreciate you
helping us with our IVF.

17:01.166 --> 17:04.458
I've asked literally everyone
else, and no one would do it.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.709
That's how I get 90%
of my patients.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.250
Oh, I'm just so nervous,
and Matt is a mess.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.250
And then my needle kit
fell out on the bus,

17:11.333 --> 17:13.375
and I got all these
unsettling winks.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.542
Oh, I hear you. I used
to get shots all the time.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.166
And before you jump
to the obvious...

17:17.250 --> 17:18.208
Diabetes.

17:18.291 --> 17:19.792
...steroids-- in med school,

17:19.875 --> 17:22.166
I used to let my classmates
practice giving shots on me.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.583
Ten bucks a pop.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.834
Oh. People used to pay me
in college, too.

17:25.917 --> 17:27.583
For... stuff.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.083
Please don't make this weird,
Colleen.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.583
Just turn around,
drop your pants,

17:30.667 --> 17:31.834
and let's make a baby.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.834
Okay.
(chuckles) Here we go.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.834
Just give me a little
heads-up, okay?

17:35.917 --> 17:37.917
-Sure.
-Because, uh,

17:35.917 --> 17:37.917
I'm really nervous,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
and my-my reflexes
are crazy.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.583
-Done!
-So when you get... What?

17:42.709 --> 17:43.750
Tim!

17:43.834 --> 17:46.083
You really are a great doctor!

17:46.166 --> 17:48.500
-Eh, it was nothing.
-That was incredible.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.500
I didn't feel a thing.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.583
I just always assumed
you were terrible.

17:50.667 --> 17:51.917
Funny, that's exactly
what Heather said

17:52.000 --> 17:53.041
when I got her pregnant.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.166
Hmm.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.667
Psst!

17:58.750 --> 18:00.166
Oh! (grunts) Hey!

18:00.250 --> 18:01.542
-Hey!
-You're, uh...

18:01.625 --> 18:02.750
you're early!

18:02.834 --> 18:04.959
Yeah, I'm really excited
for your medical magic.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.166
It's like you're
one of those chickens

18:06.250 --> 18:07.375
that can play tic-tac-toe.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.667
Like, you don't
believe it's possible,

18:08.750 --> 18:10.083
and all of a sudden,
there you are;

18:10.166 --> 18:11.417
he's beating you three straight.
(chuckles)

18:11.500 --> 18:12.583
Now, I don't mean

18:12.667 --> 18:14.792
to be nosy, but I am.
What's that?

18:14.875 --> 18:17.792
That? Oh, that... Uh, yarn.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.625
Surgical yarn.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.500
Okay, I knit. It relaxes me.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.917
But just please don't
tell the family, okay?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.125
'Cause then they'll finally have
something to tease me about.

18:27.208 --> 18:28.166
There it is.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.000
Aw! I think it's so sweet.

18:30.083 --> 18:33.041
-Yeah. See?
-What is that, a... pot holder?

18:33.125 --> 18:35.000
-Or...
-No! It's a sweater.

18:35.792 --> 18:36.959
Or vest. I...

18:37.041 --> 18:38.834
Maybe it's a sweater vest.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.667
-Let me help you.
-You know how to knit?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.250
-Oh.
-Yeah, my mother wouldn't buy me

18:42.333 --> 18:44.250
a thong, so my <i>abuelita</i>
knitted me one.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.375
It was very progressive,
and also very uncomfortable.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.041
Whoa, look at you!
You're like a regular...

18:50.125 --> 18:52.875
-famous knitter.
-(chuckles) There you go.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.542
These past few weeks
have been nice.

18:55.625 --> 18:59.125
-Yeah.
-I like that we have

18:55.625 --> 18:59.125
our private little club, and...

18:59.208 --> 19:02.291
it's kind of fun keeping another
secret from my wife, you know?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.417
-(chuckles)
-Oh, you know what?

19:04.500 --> 19:07.125
I'll undo mine. I'll undo mine.
You keep going.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.542
-Oh! You're so patient.
-Yeah. (chuckles)

19:09.625 --> 19:11.959
You know what,
you are gonna make a great mom.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.500
Aw. Thank you so much, Tim.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.208
Sure.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.083
-Psst!
-It was clogged

19:19.667 --> 19:22.083
when I went in there!

19:22.166 --> 19:25.041
No... What? No, come here, man.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.500
Colleen told me
your little secret.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.667
What? You can't trust her.
She's a liar.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.250
No, she says
you're a great doctor.

19:31.333 --> 19:34.166
Oh. Then I take back
what I just said. She's lovely.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.375
I was wondering
if you would teach me

19:36.458 --> 19:38.208
how to give her
the shots myself.

19:38.291 --> 19:39.917
Oh, no, I don't mind
doing the shots.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.375
And despite what I just said,

19:41.458 --> 19:43.000
I really do value
her friendship.

19:43.083 --> 19:45.125
Okay,
but I need to overcome this.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.041
If-if I can do it, man,
she'll be really happy.

19:47.125 --> 19:50.333
Okay. Look, it's gonna be
hard to stick this

19:50.417 --> 19:53.250
into someone you respect, so
just pretend I'm somebody else.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.375
I have to, uh,
sanitize the area here

19:55.458 --> 19:57.208
and get a little bit
of a...

19:57.291 --> 19:58.291
(shouts)

19:58.375 --> 20:00.625
Oh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

20:00.709 --> 20:03.834
-You just pumped estrogen
into my kidneys!

20:00.709 --> 20:03.834
-Oh, no.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.417
Breathe better.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.083
Huh.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.709
Nah.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.709
-(knocking)
-Hi!

20:15.792 --> 20:17.875
-Oh! Hey!
-Just wanted to stop by

20:17.959 --> 20:20.458
and say thank you so much
for everything.

20:20.542 --> 20:22.500
Matt is doing great.
(chuckles)

20:22.583 --> 20:24.500
Well, not exactly great.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.000
But at least
he's stopped crying and he waits

20:26.083 --> 20:27.417
until I leave to throw up.
(chuckles)

20:27.500 --> 20:29.375
(chuckles) Well,
it took a lot of work.

20:29.458 --> 20:31.166
Matt treated me
like a voodoo doll.

20:31.250 --> 20:34.083
Somewhere out there,
there's a giant Tim

20:34.166 --> 20:36.083
-who's in a lot of pain.
-(chuckles)

20:36.166 --> 20:38.458
I'm really gonna miss
our needle parties.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.125
-Yeah, me, too.
-Yeah.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.917
Hey. This is for you.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.834
-Aw.
-For helping me learn to knit.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.166
Thank you.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.417
For when you get pregnant.
They're baby booties.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.333
Oh.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.959
-So cute.
-Yeah.
