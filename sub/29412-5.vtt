WEBVTT

00:25.322 --> 00:27.110
Naughty thought.

00:27.618 --> 00:30.419
How about we don't wait
12 minutes for our next kiss?

00:30.421 --> 00:33.622
We would never see the end of the movie.

00:41.599 --> 00:43.765
Oh.

00:47.738 --> 00:49.003
Mm.

00:51.842 --> 00:54.288
It's better if we stick to the schedule.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.125
Sure.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.970
Didn't hear you come in last night.

01:10.994 --> 01:14.495
So I'm guessing it went well at Carly's.

01:14.497 --> 01:18.395
The end of the movie
was very predictable.

01:18.834 --> 01:21.168
Not the question I was asking,

01:21.170 --> 01:23.901
but you still managed to answer it.

01:24.374 --> 01:27.375
Carly touches me when we kiss.

01:27.377 --> 01:29.677
You don't like her touching you?

01:29.679 --> 01:31.579
- Oh, I... I do.
- Oh.

01:31.581 --> 01:36.884
But I prefer to touch only
one thing at a time.

01:36.886 --> 01:41.322
Have you told her you prefer to
touch only one thing at a time?

01:41.324 --> 01:43.190
In those exact words?

01:51.534 --> 01:52.767
Oh!

01:52.769 --> 01:54.702
Whatever it is, I'm definitely in.

01:54.704 --> 01:56.236
My first lead surgery!

01:56.238 --> 01:57.371
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:57.373 --> 01:59.807
Shaun! That is awesome!

01:59.809 --> 02:01.975
I am going to rock it!

02:01.977 --> 02:04.278
Oh, hells to the yeah you are!

02:10.787 --> 02:12.282
Oh!

02:13.255 --> 02:21.256

02:23.598 --> 02:24.698
How you doing?

02:24.700 --> 02:25.712
I'm good.

02:26.501 --> 02:29.636
Thank you for helping me
with the sea lions.

02:29.638 --> 02:30.970
I'll never say no to a caper.

02:30.972 --> 02:33.606
But I'd like to keep my mother's
death between the two of us.

02:33.608 --> 02:36.409
I just... I can't deal with
people's platitudes right now.

02:36.411 --> 02:39.145
Okay, but that kinda suggests
you're <i> not</i> good.

02:39.147 --> 02:40.313
This is textbook denial.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.315
It's only going to inhibit
your grief process.

02:42.317 --> 02:44.250
Denial is the first step
in the grief process,

02:44.252 --> 02:45.618
so I'd say I'm right on track.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.554
But thank you for your platitudes.

02:49.458 --> 02:50.790
This is Curtis.

02:50.792 --> 02:53.025
He decided to fix his chimney
without a safety harness.

02:53.027 --> 02:54.894
He has open bilateral tib-fib fractures.

02:54.896 --> 02:57.129
They wanted $1,200 for a two-hour job.

02:57.131 --> 02:59.966
And I can still do a Hurricane Grind.

02:59.968 --> 03:02.869
It's a skateboard move
that builds off a 180 Ollie.

03:02.871 --> 03:05.036
I got great balance.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.208
Pupils are slow to react.

03:10.210 --> 03:13.178
Unfortunately, balance is less
great after a few cocktails.

03:14.515 --> 03:15.848
Not me.

03:15.850 --> 03:17.483
Clean and sober six years, three months,

03:17.485 --> 03:19.050
and... and 24 days.

03:20.521 --> 03:23.054
Get him on IV antibiotics
and to OR Level One.

03:23.056 --> 03:24.790
And run a BAC.

03:27.361 --> 03:29.294
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.129
Your surgeon.

03:35.636 --> 03:40.672
Esophageal cancer is a serious condition.

03:40.674 --> 03:44.643
However, you don't have any remote

03:44.645 --> 03:46.311
or metastatic disease

03:46.313 --> 03:49.281
and responded well to chemoradiation,

03:49.283 --> 03:51.617
so a resection of the esophagus

03:51.619 --> 03:53.886
should render you cancer-free.

03:56.784 --> 03:58.684
You look awfully young.

04:02.896 --> 04:06.264
I always say, the younger they
are, the smarter they must be.

04:09.602 --> 04:11.202
Oh, oh, yes.

04:11.204 --> 04:15.273
We will pull the stomach up
and attach it to the remains

04:15.275 --> 04:18.875
of your esophagus, keeping your
GI system connected,

04:18.878 --> 04:21.046
so you will not need
a permanent feeding tube.

04:21.048 --> 04:23.448
My oncologist told me all this,

04:23.450 --> 04:25.883
but I refused to believe it...

04:25.885 --> 04:28.086
that it was all gonna be okay...

04:28.088 --> 04:30.322
until I heard it from my surgeon.

04:30.324 --> 04:32.557
Oh!

04:32.559 --> 04:34.960
I'm sorry, it's just...

04:34.962 --> 04:39.297
I've been through a divorce
and a career change...

04:39.299 --> 04:42.500
and I finally bought my own cafe...

04:42.502 --> 04:45.837
three days before I got my diagnosis.

04:45.839 --> 04:48.811
And I thought it was a sign
I was making a mistake.

04:48.813 --> 04:51.142
But it was just the opposite.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.153
I wasn't done.

04:55.582 --> 04:57.247
Oh, I'm sorry...

04:57.249 --> 05:01.118
I have to inform you
of the risks of this procedure.

05:01.120 --> 05:06.791
There is a 7% chance
of heart and lung problems,

05:06.793 --> 05:11.496
a 12% chance of infection,
a 0.5% of death, among others.

05:18.938 --> 05:20.404
Bring it, Dr. Murphy.

05:30.717 --> 05:32.550
Shaun got very lucky.

05:32.552 --> 05:35.185
Landed the world's most genial
patient for his first case.

05:35.187 --> 05:37.388
- Nice.
- Of you.

05:37.390 --> 05:38.689
You picked that patient for him...

05:38.691 --> 05:41.258
I heard it was Park's chart
before you stepped in.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.893
Shaun's weakness is patient management.

05:42.895 --> 05:44.193
You shouldn't be coddling him.

05:44.195 --> 05:46.462
We challenge him too much, we lose him.

05:46.464 --> 05:48.264
Murphy?

05:48.266 --> 05:51.267
He perseveres. He's annoyingly resilient.

05:51.269 --> 05:55.639
I agree that some failures
don't seem to faze him at all.

05:55.641 --> 05:57.507
But it's his lifelong dream.

05:57.509 --> 05:59.676
So, yes, I think we could lose him.

05:59.678 --> 06:01.811
I'll tough-love his ass next week.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.750
Okay, Curtis, we're good to go.

06:06.752 --> 06:09.185
Curtis, my God. Are you okay?

06:09.187 --> 06:11.220
I'm thinking I should've gone
with the contractor.

06:11.222 --> 06:12.589
His thinking was impaired.

06:12.591 --> 06:15.025
He had a blood alcohol level of .09.

06:17.930 --> 06:20.263
Your test must be wrong.

06:20.265 --> 06:23.332
You were quite inebriated
when you came in.

06:23.334 --> 06:25.769
That's impossible. Curtis doesn't drink.

06:26.805 --> 06:28.437
We'll make a note of it in his chart.

06:28.439 --> 06:30.205
We've got to get him to the O.R.

06:41.719 --> 06:43.385
You play softball?

06:43.387 --> 06:44.653
Uh, my junior year in high school,

06:44.655 --> 06:46.789
I had an ERA of 2.95.

06:46.791 --> 06:48.657
My wife's got an arm.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.893
I can't believe you're my wife.

06:50.895 --> 06:52.494
Till death do us part.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.262
Yeah.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.809
Oh, you found Wally.

07:06.811 --> 07:08.537
You have a name for it?

07:08.846 --> 07:11.613
Yeah,
- he's my Walther PPK .32;

07:11.615 --> 07:12.914
he and I go way back.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.626
Is it loaded?

07:15.819 --> 07:17.552
I mean, is this a problem?

07:17.554 --> 07:20.522
'Cause I... I just...
I keep it in my bedside table,

07:20.524 --> 07:23.725
in my gun safe... combination 7-3-5-9.

07:23.727 --> 07:25.393
I'm not gonna remember that.

07:25.395 --> 07:27.496
I don't want to remember that.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.732
If we're gonna live together,

07:30.734 --> 07:35.370
we're gonna need
to make some compromises.

07:43.113 --> 07:44.656
You nervous?

07:45.249 --> 07:47.048
How badly are you freaking out?

07:47.050 --> 07:50.551
I'm not badly freaking out.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.421
I've assisted in six
esophageal resections,

07:54.423 --> 07:57.024
all of which were free of complications.

07:57.026 --> 07:58.759
So you're overdue for a blow-up.

08:01.531 --> 08:02.530
Sorry.

08:02.532 --> 08:04.165
I'm just a bit annoyed

08:04.167 --> 08:07.100
'cause I had my hand on this case first,

08:07.102 --> 08:09.436
and now I'm third out of four, at best.

08:12.841 --> 08:15.309
But I'm happy for you.

08:15.311 --> 08:16.855
Really.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.713
I'm happy for me, too.

08:20.849 --> 08:23.987
She has extensive scar tissue.

08:24.487 --> 08:29.089
And it's plastered her stomach
to her anterior abdominal wall.

08:29.091 --> 08:34.664
I told her she wouldn't need
a permanent feeding tube.

08:36.231 --> 08:38.530
But she will.

08:41.034 --> 08:44.171
We've got to tell a budding chef
she'll never eat again.

08:45.009 --> 08:47.743
How will she react?

08:47.745 --> 08:49.377
Don't know.

08:49.379 --> 08:51.246
Badly. But the specifics...

08:51.248 --> 08:52.915
You should tell her.

08:52.917 --> 08:54.850
She's your patient, it's your job.

08:54.852 --> 08:57.853
I'm bad at patient communication.

08:57.855 --> 09:00.789
If I make her very unhappy,

09:00.791 --> 09:03.058
she may not want me to do the surgery.

09:03.060 --> 09:04.426
If you're not willing to take that risk,

09:04.428 --> 09:06.094
then you should hand
the case over to Park.

09:06.096 --> 09:10.199
No. I don't want to hand
the case over to Dr. Park.

09:11.869 --> 09:14.621
Park will tell Beth.

09:14.905 --> 09:17.306
And, Shaun, it's still your surgery.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.546
Drill.

09:27.584 --> 09:29.617
Do you see his heart rhythm?

09:30.855 --> 09:32.620
Rate controlled A-fib.

09:32.622 --> 09:34.189
Wasn't on his record.

09:34.191 --> 09:36.191
Ask his wife about it post-op.

09:36.193 --> 09:38.026
Probably a symptom of binge drinking.

09:38.028 --> 09:40.862
Which he'll lie to us about and
she'll tell us she believes.

09:42.599 --> 09:44.399
She's in denial?

09:48.271 --> 09:50.572
You had surgery as a child.

09:50.574 --> 09:53.375
As a baby. I don't even remember it.

09:53.377 --> 09:55.042
There's considerable scar tissue...

09:55.044 --> 09:56.878
more than we'd typically expect to find.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.014
Which has affected our surgical plan.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.683
How?

10:01.685 --> 10:03.785
Dr. Murphy will field that question.

10:05.221 --> 10:07.321
No, Dr. Lim s-said...

10:07.323 --> 10:08.956
Proceed, Dr. Murphy.

10:12.061 --> 10:13.928
Somebody please tell me.

10:21.905 --> 10:26.441
We can't move your stomach up,
so you will need a feeding tube.

10:29.945 --> 10:33.032
For the rest of your life.

10:33.816 --> 10:38.485
The good news is that
this surgery is simpler,

10:38.487 --> 10:43.123
so your recovery time will be
shorter by three to five days.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.835
Hey.

10:56.872 --> 10:58.972
Do any of you own a gun?

11:01.977 --> 11:04.244
Is there someone you'd like
"taken care of"?

11:04.246 --> 11:06.513
- Ah.
- I still have my service pistol.

11:06.515 --> 11:08.549
I have a Sig P365.

11:08.551 --> 11:12.018
Do any of you have, or have you ever had,

11:12.020 --> 11:14.354
issues about it with
your significant others?

11:16.057 --> 11:18.758
After our son was born,
my wife suddenly hated

11:18.760 --> 11:21.060
having a firearm in the house.

11:21.062 --> 11:24.000
And one night, I came home late to a...

11:24.933 --> 11:26.231
PowerPoint presentation.

11:26.233 --> 11:27.967
90 minutes of horrifying statistics.

11:27.969 --> 11:30.536
Now it's in a locker at my gun range.

11:30.538 --> 11:32.371
Lotta set up but I like that.

11:32.373 --> 11:35.908
I had a boyfriend who felt very
weird about me having a gun.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.944
He wasn't big on logic,

11:37.946 --> 11:40.079
so I took the emotional approach.

11:40.081 --> 11:41.747
Told him it's not for the firepower,

11:41.749 --> 11:44.283
it's for the confidence it gives
me as a woman when I carry it.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.352
I lived with a guy who had a gun.

11:46.354 --> 11:48.354
Had to use the nuclear option.

11:48.356 --> 11:50.823
It goes or he goes.

11:50.825 --> 11:52.492
It worked... they both went.

11:54.696 --> 11:56.729
Well, that's just wonderful.

12:02.136 --> 12:03.835
I heard your news.

12:03.837 --> 12:05.170
It's pretty exciting.

12:05.172 --> 12:07.206
I jumped seven times.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.940
How's the anxiety level?

12:08.942 --> 12:10.876
Why do people keep asking me that?

12:12.313 --> 12:13.879
Everyone has doubts, Shaun.

12:13.881 --> 12:15.147
I'm excited.

12:15.149 --> 12:17.883
You can be excited. And nervous.

12:17.885 --> 12:20.056
Usually they go together.

12:20.521 --> 12:24.156
Speaking of, uh, I'm sorry if I was a bit

12:24.158 --> 12:26.358
too assertive last night.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.860
Lea said it must be tricky for you.

12:30.197 --> 12:34.433
So now Lea is also privy to the
intimacies of our intimacy?

12:34.435 --> 12:36.135
- Great.
- Yes.

12:39.673 --> 12:40.839
Oh.

12:40.841 --> 12:43.041
Lea said to tell you

12:43.043 --> 12:46.444
that I prefer to touch
only thing at a time.

12:52.652 --> 12:55.353
Located upper esophageal sphincter.

12:55.355 --> 12:58.389
You have a good tumor margin...
resecting above or below?

12:58.391 --> 13:00.124
- Below.
- Mm-hmm.

13:02.395 --> 13:04.662
Shaun gave the news
to his patient after all.

13:04.664 --> 13:06.030
Shaun did what I expected.

13:06.032 --> 13:07.731
He upset her, but the news is upsetting.

13:07.733 --> 13:08.699
She'll deal with it,
he'll learn how to...

13:08.701 --> 13:10.401
She wants him off the case.

13:15.675 --> 13:17.697
- Shaun...
- No...

13:19.512 --> 13:21.745
Shaun, I will find you another case.

13:21.747 --> 13:25.382
This is my case.

13:25.384 --> 13:28.018
I prepared for this case.

13:28.020 --> 13:30.054
I don't want another case.

13:32.825 --> 13:34.524
Dr. Murphy...

14:02.089 --> 14:03.993
You're learning, Shaun.

14:04.524 --> 14:06.258
That's what you do
at a teaching hospital.

14:06.260 --> 14:07.826
I'm learning, too.

14:09.629 --> 14:11.596
Going from attending to Chief of Surgery

14:11.598 --> 14:13.799
is... a big deal.

14:14.634 --> 14:18.837
Every day, every decision,
every mistake...

14:18.839 --> 14:20.806
I learn something.

14:20.808 --> 14:22.274
So do you.

14:24.344 --> 14:25.844
No, I don't.

14:25.846 --> 14:28.780
I have a developmental disorder.

14:35.555 --> 14:37.856
- Come with me.
- I'm waiting for my bus.

14:37.858 --> 14:39.691
You can take a later one.

14:42.228 --> 14:44.495
I'm sure I mentioned I was Chief?

14:49.235 --> 14:50.501
Hi, Beth.

14:52.706 --> 14:55.306
I'm sorry for what you're going through.

14:55.308 --> 14:59.844
And Dr. Murphy's phrasing
was unfortunate.

14:59.846 --> 15:02.380
But there's been no deceit or negligence.

15:02.382 --> 15:03.715
He's an excellent surgeon

15:03.717 --> 15:05.783
who has my full confidence in the O.R.

15:05.785 --> 15:07.972
And if you don't trust him,
you don't trust me.

15:10.289 --> 15:11.622
So, I would recommend

15:11.624 --> 15:13.424
you have your surgery
at a different hospital.

15:13.426 --> 15:15.440
I can make arrangements.

15:15.795 --> 15:19.163
However, if you reconsider,
we can proceed as scheduled

15:19.165 --> 15:20.931
first thing tomorrow morning.

15:43.522 --> 15:45.355
If you don't want people to know
your mother died,

15:45.357 --> 15:48.492
stop acting like someone
whose mother died.

15:48.494 --> 15:52.393
I'm gonna move on to the second
stage of grief... anger.

15:53.131 --> 15:54.398
I'm not acting depressed.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.332
No, you're acting bitchy.

15:56.334 --> 15:58.402
But you're not a bitch,
so that looks weird on you,

15:58.404 --> 16:00.504
and people are gonna know something's up.

16:00.506 --> 16:02.472
So, do you want me happier or sadder?

16:02.474 --> 16:04.574
Let me know, because I'm really
looking for your approval.

16:06.612 --> 16:08.177
Bitchy...

16:13.118 --> 16:15.752
You really think this guy's
still on the wagon?

16:15.754 --> 16:18.621
Just because he's a drunk
doesn't mean he's not sick.

16:18.623 --> 16:21.090
But all you can see is an addict
married to an enabler,

16:21.092 --> 16:23.793
so all roads lead to rum.

16:25.596 --> 16:27.345
C'mon, that was cute.

16:27.999 --> 16:31.432
No IV wall motion abnormalities.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.869
No valvular disease or dysfunction.

16:33.871 --> 16:37.073
Ruling out any structural cause
for the arrhythmia.

16:37.075 --> 16:39.375
You win. Congratulations.

16:41.813 --> 16:43.012
- Hey!
- Hey.

16:43.014 --> 16:44.948
How was your day?

16:44.950 --> 16:47.073
Good, good.

16:47.819 --> 16:49.152
Pensive.

16:49.154 --> 16:51.254
I was thinking about your gun
and why you need it...

16:51.256 --> 16:53.289
- Oh, Aaron, I... I don't...
- No, no, no.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.758
I was an idiot and a guy, I get it.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.061
You walking alone
in a garage late at night,

16:58.063 --> 16:59.963
you walking alone on the street
late at night...

16:59.965 --> 17:03.566
Or getting into my own car,
or even my own house.

17:03.568 --> 17:04.800
Exactly.

17:04.801 --> 17:06.569
That's why I got you a surprise.

17:08.573 --> 17:11.073
- Yeah?
- Right outside the back door.

17:18.449 --> 17:20.915
We have exactly 10 seconds
to punch in the code

17:20.917 --> 17:23.385
before S.E.A.L. Team Six arrives.

17:23.387 --> 17:26.421
7-3-5-9.

17:26.423 --> 17:29.424
Every door, every window,
every vent over 36 inches.

17:29.426 --> 17:31.861
This is your security fob.

17:31.863 --> 17:35.030
Works in all 48 contiguous
states and Canada.

17:35.032 --> 17:39.468
You have no idea how much extra
comfort this is gonna give me.

17:41.638 --> 17:43.371
Actually, I was hoping it would be

17:43.373 --> 17:46.040
your primary source of comfort.

17:48.344 --> 17:52.113
You were thinking that this would mean

17:52.115 --> 17:53.114
I would give up my gun?

17:53.116 --> 17:55.249
That's exactly what I was thinking.

17:55.251 --> 17:57.986
Well, the first rule of security
systems is redundancy.

17:57.988 --> 18:00.221
By that logic, we should get
a tank for the garage.

18:00.223 --> 18:02.423
Aaron, it shouldn't matter
why I want a gun...

18:02.425 --> 18:05.359
whether it's because it makes me
feel more secure,

18:05.361 --> 18:06.995
or it was a memento of my dad's

18:06.997 --> 18:09.564
or just because it's fun to shoot.

18:09.566 --> 18:12.734
All that matters is I'm a grown-up,

18:12.736 --> 18:16.404
and I'm responsible, and I want it.

18:20.911 --> 18:22.977
You're ruining Shaun.

18:22.979 --> 18:25.413
Maybe you got him over the hump
of patient management,

18:25.415 --> 18:27.281
but what about surgical management?

18:27.283 --> 18:29.083
Taking charge of the O.R.,

18:29.085 --> 18:32.386
keeping lines of communication
open, everyone cooperating.

18:32.388 --> 18:34.021
You're throwing him into the deep end,

18:34.023 --> 18:35.456
and that's unfair to him.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.824
Unless you plan to scrub in
as a lifeguard.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.227
He'll be fine.

18:42.131 --> 18:43.697
You handpicked his surgical team?

18:47.036 --> 18:48.735
You're ruining him.

18:50.940 --> 18:53.107
The tests prove his arrhythmia
is associated

18:53.109 --> 18:55.376
with excessive ethanol consumption.

18:55.378 --> 18:56.944
But there's no permanent damage

18:56.946 --> 18:58.912
and his rhythm will return to normal

18:58.914 --> 19:01.332
in the absence of any further drinking.

19:05.754 --> 19:08.089
We met when we were 15.

19:09.324 --> 19:11.291
I was first clarinet, he was second.

19:12.461 --> 19:14.962
We were at a band festival
in Anaheim when he found out

19:14.964 --> 19:17.139
his parents died in a plane crash.

19:19.001 --> 19:22.478
We grieved together and fell in love.

19:23.906 --> 19:25.505
Then he started drinking.

19:28.410 --> 19:31.745
It wasn't until I threatened to
leave that he finally woke up.

19:33.649 --> 19:35.983
The day he received
his two-year recovery chip

19:35.985 --> 19:38.619
was the day we got married.

19:38.621 --> 19:39.920
The day he vowed to me,

19:39.922 --> 19:42.422
and a church full
of our family and friends,

19:42.424 --> 19:45.042
that he would never drink again.

19:45.761 --> 19:47.995
Our marriage is built on his sobriety.

19:52.768 --> 19:54.467
I believe him.

19:54.469 --> 20:00.439
Teal, we ran the BAC three times,

20:00.441 --> 20:02.541
and the results were consistent.

20:05.046 --> 20:07.189
I believe in my husband.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.348
I have to.

20:11.786 --> 20:13.404
His BP is dropping.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.387
Temp is normal.

20:15.389 --> 20:17.123
Check for causes of shock.

20:19.493 --> 20:22.955
Upper GI bleed... need stat
hematocrits and transfuse blood.

20:28.351 --> 20:30.619
Surgery's the easy-peasy part.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.270
You wanted this, enjoy it.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.391
I can't.

20:42.833 --> 20:47.201
If I get distracted, if I get upset...

20:47.203 --> 20:49.303
If you do, Andrews has your back.

20:49.305 --> 20:54.676
If Dr. Andrews has to take over,
then I have failed.

20:54.678 --> 20:58.713
I have failed, and I have
endangered a patient's life,

20:58.715 --> 21:01.816
and if I'm no good
at the easy-peasy part,

21:01.818 --> 21:04.455
then what part am I good at?

21:05.555 --> 21:08.222
What do we do when we get
all nutty like this?

21:11.361 --> 21:13.394
Blow out the candles.

21:13.396 --> 21:15.508
How many do you need?

21:16.565 --> 21:18.498
Three.

21:43.592 --> 21:45.659
Hey. I was looking for you.

21:45.661 --> 21:47.161
Big day, huh?

21:47.163 --> 21:48.228
How are your nerves holding up?

21:48.230 --> 21:49.930
I'm not nervous.

21:49.932 --> 21:52.232
Of course you're nervous.
Everybody's nervous.

21:52.234 --> 21:54.367
It just means that you care.

21:54.369 --> 21:58.505
Being nervous means I feel
inadequate and unprepared,

21:58.507 --> 21:59.773
and if I am either of those things,

21:59.775 --> 22:01.675
it doesn't matter whether I care or not.

22:01.677 --> 22:04.344
You are more than adequate,
and you're very prepared.

22:04.346 --> 22:06.746
You remind me of a...
a young surgeon I knew once.

22:06.748 --> 22:09.782
The day he got his first lead,
he was thrilled,

22:09.784 --> 22:12.752
but he was a mess, trying to
remember a million things,

22:12.754 --> 22:15.522
imagining a million things
that could go wrong.

22:15.524 --> 22:18.291
But then he remembered the birth process,

22:18.293 --> 22:20.893
how moms are asked to pick a focal point,

22:20.895 --> 22:23.019
- let everything filter through that.
- Hmm.

22:23.021 --> 22:26.787
So, he chose the color orange
to focus on.

22:27.669 --> 22:30.303
This is the cap that he focused on,

22:30.305 --> 22:33.640
and he got through it with flying colors.

22:33.642 --> 22:35.041
Maybe it'll help.

22:37.846 --> 22:40.647
Why do you have the young surgeon's cap?

22:42.884 --> 22:44.517
I was being coy.

22:44.519 --> 22:46.753
The young surgeon was me.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.670
Konnichiwa.

23:06.474 --> 23:08.240
That's Japanese for hello.

23:08.242 --> 23:11.744
Konnichiwa. I have surgery in 42 minutes.

23:11.746 --> 23:14.752
Which is why I'm here, to wish you luck.

23:15.316 --> 23:18.850
I don't need luck.

23:18.852 --> 23:20.719
Everyone needs luck.

23:23.791 --> 23:25.658
That was a good luck kiss.

23:25.660 --> 23:28.641
How can a kiss give you...

23:30.130 --> 23:31.769
So was that.

23:32.599 --> 23:36.232
I am feeling a bit lucky.

23:36.736 --> 23:39.470
You know the thing that Lea
told you to tell me?

23:39.472 --> 23:40.772
Yes.

23:40.774 --> 23:42.473
That was actually great advice.

23:42.475 --> 23:44.074
It's important that we tell each other

23:44.076 --> 23:45.710
exactly what we like and what we don't.

23:45.712 --> 23:49.580
I also don't like pickles,
sirens, anything wool...

23:49.582 --> 23:53.818
I was thinking more in the romantic area.

23:53.820 --> 23:58.756
And right now, we are not going
to touch lips anymore.

23:58.758 --> 24:01.192
Because there's something else
I want you to touch.

24:16.274 --> 24:18.041
So, what do you think?

24:27.505 --> 24:29.571
You don't have any lumps.

24:30.456 --> 24:32.188
Win-win.

24:43.034 --> 24:45.602
Lab and imaging tests rule out Crohn's,

24:45.604 --> 24:49.339
gastroenteritis, C-diff colitis,
and even H pylori.

24:49.341 --> 24:50.907
Leaving bleeding ulcers.

24:50.909 --> 24:52.809
Caused by alcohol abuse.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.646
He needs to be on a proton pump inhibitor

24:56.648 --> 24:59.382
and octreotide to prevent
any further blood loss.

25:07.125 --> 25:08.524
No.

25:08.526 --> 25:10.126
He loves you.

25:10.128 --> 25:12.262
That's why he hasn't been honest.

25:12.264 --> 25:15.564
Doesn't make it right,
but it's that same love

25:15.566 --> 25:18.534
that kept you together
through everything.

25:18.536 --> 25:20.636
And it'll get you through this, too.

25:29.014 --> 25:31.096
He's telling the truth.

25:31.783 --> 25:33.549
We'll run more tests.

25:34.819 --> 25:37.561
Your faith in your husband is impressive.

25:38.023 --> 25:39.355
But it may have just killed him.

27:23.092 --> 27:24.725
Ten blade, please.

27:51.086 --> 27:55.989
Located lower end of esophageal lesion.

27:55.991 --> 27:58.202
Linear cutting stapler.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.895
Resecting the esophagus
from the stomach...

28:05.200 --> 28:09.102
I'm now at the upper end of the lesion.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.303
Hemoclips.

28:25.386 --> 28:26.852
Dr. Murphy?

28:26.854 --> 28:28.398
No.

28:29.323 --> 28:30.823
No...

28:30.825 --> 28:31.891
What's the matter?

28:31.893 --> 28:35.227
No, no, no...

28:35.229 --> 28:36.328
Shaun, what are you seeing?

28:36.330 --> 28:38.030
Can't... can't do this!

28:38.032 --> 28:39.298
What... what can't you do?

28:39.300 --> 28:40.700
- No!
- Don't... No.

28:40.702 --> 28:44.069
No! No! No! No!

28:44.071 --> 28:46.037
- Dr. Murphy!
- No!!

28:46.039 --> 28:47.505
Dr. Murphy!!

28:47.507 --> 28:48.607
Go, go!

28:48.609 --> 28:50.675
Page Dr. Lim. Keep her stable.

28:54.050 --> 28:57.613
No. No. No.

28:57.615 --> 28:59.638
Yur...

29:01.892 --> 29:03.291
No.

29:03.293 --> 29:04.726
No.

29:04.728 --> 29:06.128
No.

29:06.130 --> 29:08.513
- Yur...
- What happened?

29:08.538 --> 29:11.306
- No, no, no.
- He lost it, walked out mid-procedure.

29:11.308 --> 29:14.442
Yuri... Yu...

29:14.444 --> 29:16.777
Yuri kucho saiken. Shaun?

29:16.779 --> 29:19.914
Yur... Yuri... Yur...

29:19.916 --> 29:22.226
Okay, Park, take over the surgery.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.418
Y... No!

29:24.420 --> 29:26.187
Dr. Park.

29:26.189 --> 29:28.189
Y...

29:30.126 --> 29:32.460
- No.
- He obviously can't.

29:32.462 --> 29:33.594
I don't think he lost it.

29:33.596 --> 29:34.762
He was in complete charge of that room.

29:34.764 --> 29:35.964
I don't think this is a meltdown.

29:35.966 --> 29:37.331
He said he can't do it.

29:37.333 --> 29:40.367
He said, "Can't do it."
Maybe he meant we can't do it.

29:40.369 --> 29:41.668
I think he's seeing something...

29:41.670 --> 29:43.682
We have a patient open on the table.

29:44.273 --> 29:47.019
Shaun, you have to tell us
what you're seeing.

29:47.021 --> 29:48.375
It's okay, Shaun.

29:51.213 --> 29:52.645
Breathe.

30:09.265 --> 30:12.260
That's it. Now slowly.

30:12.262 --> 30:14.434
What are you thinking?

30:17.136 --> 30:18.550
When...

30:20.772 --> 30:25.057
Okay. When I examined
the upper portion...

30:26.344 --> 30:27.944
When I examined the upper portion,

30:27.946 --> 30:30.847
there was a much larger area

30:30.849 --> 30:33.717
of tumor-free esophagus
than anticipated...

30:33.719 --> 30:36.386
That's correct, but not nearly
enough to reach the stomach.

30:36.388 --> 30:40.590
But there is enough to accept
a jejunum free flap,

30:40.592 --> 30:44.193
using a portion of the small intestine

30:44.195 --> 30:45.996
to replace the resected esophagus.

30:45.998 --> 30:47.463
We don't do jejunum free flaps.

30:47.465 --> 30:49.332
They do in Japan.

30:49.334 --> 30:51.067
They do in Japan.

30:51.069 --> 30:54.738
I've been studying their technique...

30:54.740 --> 30:57.908
Yuri kucho saiken.

30:57.910 --> 31:00.509
They have had great success.

31:01.046 --> 31:03.479
It would mean Beth
wouldn't need a feeding tube.

31:03.481 --> 31:05.248
But...

31:05.250 --> 31:08.818
it is v-very complex.

31:09.594 --> 31:13.022
It's too complex for you to lead.

31:13.024 --> 31:15.315
So you'll lose your case.

31:16.193 --> 31:18.060
Yes...

31:20.798 --> 31:23.732
I haven't done a transposition
graft like that before.

31:27.004 --> 31:28.437
Think you can walk us through it?

31:31.042 --> 31:32.541
Yes.

31:35.713 --> 31:37.479
I'll scrub in.

31:46.490 --> 31:49.892
Stomach is perfect.

31:49.894 --> 31:51.893
Check the duodenum.

31:52.262 --> 31:54.496
The only way Teal
will accept the treatment

31:54.498 --> 31:56.965
is if we give her no room for denial.

31:56.967 --> 31:59.101
Did you really believe what you said?

31:59.103 --> 32:01.470
That their love is enough
to get them through this?

32:03.373 --> 32:06.408
Such BS, the belief that love is enough.

32:06.410 --> 32:08.876
Even worse, it's corollary
that a lack of love

32:08.878 --> 32:10.078
is the real problem.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.046
If only they had someone in their life

32:12.048 --> 32:13.948
who had enough faith in them,
had enough love for them,

32:13.950 --> 32:14.983
they could've pulled through.

32:14.985 --> 32:17.752
It's wrong and it's mean.

32:20.957 --> 32:22.824
What's that?

32:22.826 --> 32:24.259
Flush the area.

32:28.232 --> 32:29.297
There's our bleed.

32:29.299 --> 32:31.516
But it's not coming from an ulcer...

32:32.436 --> 32:33.801
It's coming from a tumor.

32:33.803 --> 32:35.803
It's obstructing his digestive tract.

32:35.805 --> 32:37.571
I'm paging Melendez to the O.R.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.082
- Okay.
- Actually, I'm...

32:43.107 --> 32:44.778
I'm gonna need an extra shot.

32:44.780 --> 32:46.713
Rough day?

32:46.715 --> 32:50.384
Had to help out in the E.R.
with an eight-year-old boy

32:50.386 --> 32:52.486
who was accidentally shot by his sister.

32:52.488 --> 32:55.389
He'll survive, but with brain damage.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.124
That's horrible.

32:57.126 --> 32:58.559
Yes, it is.

33:00.363 --> 33:04.064
And quite coincidental.

33:04.066 --> 33:06.733
Like so many other coincidences.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.569
You know how many kids are shot
every day in this country?

33:08.571 --> 33:09.803
19.

33:09.805 --> 33:11.938
You know you're three times
more likely to be shot

33:11.940 --> 33:13.506
if you have access
to guns than if you don't?

33:13.508 --> 33:16.143
Here's another fact...
one in four women are victims

33:16.145 --> 33:19.648
of violence at the hands
of their intimate partner.

33:20.615 --> 33:23.902
No, no, no. I'm not afraid of you.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.120
This isn't about you.

33:30.693 --> 33:32.959
Did something happen?

33:32.961 --> 33:35.062
'Cause if it did,
I want to know about it.

33:39.534 --> 33:42.836
You figure something horrible
must have happened to drive me

33:42.838 --> 33:45.706
to such an irrational,
fear-driven choice?

33:49.578 --> 33:51.178
I'm sorry. Hi.

33:57.219 --> 33:59.085
The ends of the harvested
jejunum have been matched

33:59.087 --> 34:01.354
for caliber size
for the attachment sites.

34:01.356 --> 34:05.925
You should begin proximal
attachment at the neck incision,

34:05.927 --> 34:08.428
using layer-to-layer technique
on the esophagus

34:08.429 --> 34:12.297
and microvascular anastomosis
of the vessels.

34:14.268 --> 34:15.400
You wanted to know when Dr. Semler

34:15.402 --> 34:16.902
was heading to O.R. #3.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.172
Dr. Park, scrub out and join Semler.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.445
I-if it's all right,
I'd rather stay here.

34:25.447 --> 34:27.246
You're needed where you're needed.

34:40.995 --> 34:43.690
Tumor is free.

34:45.132 --> 34:46.866
Bag it, tag it, and get it to Path.

34:50.536 --> 34:52.036
Do you smell that?

34:55.810 --> 34:58.443
Smells like a distillery.

34:58.445 --> 34:59.879
But we know he couldn't
have touched a drop

34:59.881 --> 35:01.781
for at least 24 hours.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.874
Final stitch is yours.

35:12.778 --> 35:16.681
It's completely symbolic,
but symbols can be powerful.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.474
Easy-peasy.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.648
You had something called
Auto-Brewery Syndrome.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.518
The tumor we found was blocking
your intestinal tract.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.119
So carbs weren't being digested,

35:56.121 --> 35:58.221
they were being trapped and fermented.

35:58.223 --> 36:01.691
Your stomach was actually
creating its own alcohol.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.327
You were drunk, but not from drinking.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.930
With the removal of the tumor...
which was benign...

36:06.932 --> 36:07.964
you're all good.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.365
And the arrhythmia's gone, too.

36:10.367 --> 36:12.000
I never doubted you.

36:15.005 --> 36:17.940
Her faith in you saved your life.

36:21.011 --> 36:22.578
Thank you.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.820
I was so pissed when Lim kicked me out...

36:30.822 --> 36:34.189
until I found Semler had
an appendectomy waiting for me.

36:34.191 --> 36:36.525
Got my first lead after all.

36:36.527 --> 36:41.448
I'm happy for you. Really.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.031
I'm happy for me, too.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.470
You earned it.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.505
And you'll get your chance
again soon, Shaun.

36:54.579 --> 36:57.312
So that's it? All's well that ends well?

36:57.314 --> 36:59.247
Your surgeon walked out on his case.

36:59.249 --> 37:02.117
That's your takeaway? That he failed?

37:02.119 --> 37:03.318
A chef can eat.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.920
Well, as a diagnostician,

37:05.922 --> 37:09.057
he did something wonderful,
but as a surgeon?

37:09.059 --> 37:11.460
Yes, he failed.

37:13.297 --> 37:15.530
We don't work alone, Marcus.

37:15.532 --> 37:17.665
Every time we have a good outcome,

37:17.667 --> 37:20.668
it's because everyone in the
room did something right.

37:20.670 --> 37:23.838
Shaun came up with the idea,
Park got it out of him,

37:23.840 --> 37:27.409
I approved the surgery, and you?

37:27.411 --> 37:29.344
The only reason Shaun is working here

37:29.346 --> 37:31.858
is because you believed in him.

37:32.782 --> 37:34.282
Yay, team.

37:38.822 --> 37:41.756
Are you still having a gun fight?

37:41.758 --> 37:43.257
Oh, yeah.

37:43.259 --> 37:46.728
Second day of my marriage
and we are at an impasse.

37:46.730 --> 37:49.664
Tried the logical approach,
I tried the emotional approach,

37:49.666 --> 37:51.833
no compromise.

37:51.835 --> 37:55.590
Only thing left is the nuclear
option, which really sucks.

37:57.908 --> 38:00.975
The thought of having a gun
in my house makes me sick...

38:04.748 --> 38:07.882
Has Debbie let you touch her breast?

38:11.320 --> 38:12.732
What?

38:14.057 --> 38:18.279
Has Debbie let you touch her breast?

38:19.495 --> 38:20.828
Yeah.

38:23.466 --> 38:27.768
Then you shouldn't worry
about anything else.

38:42.517 --> 38:44.718
I was wrong...

38:44.720 --> 38:47.054
this time.

38:47.056 --> 38:52.559
But 99.9% of cases, I would be right.

38:52.561 --> 38:55.261
If... if someone acts like
an addict, lies like an addict,

38:55.263 --> 38:58.164
smells like an addict,
then they are an addict.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.433
And just because we stumbled across

39:00.435 --> 39:03.532
the one ridiculously fluky exception,

39:03.534 --> 39:06.372
that isn't going to change
my attitude moving forward.

39:10.712 --> 39:12.478
I respect you, Claire.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.247
Might even go as far
as to say I like you.

39:15.249 --> 39:17.516
And I know you're angry right now.

39:17.518 --> 39:19.451
At your mother.

39:19.453 --> 39:21.553
The world.

39:21.555 --> 39:23.288
Yourself.

39:24.291 --> 39:26.191
Eventually, that'll go away.

39:26.193 --> 39:28.327
Or... at least some of it will.

39:28.329 --> 39:31.563
But until then, giving up on that 0.1%

39:31.565 --> 39:34.433
means giving up on something else.

39:34.435 --> 39:36.301
Hope.

39:39.607 --> 39:41.362
Hope...

39:42.677 --> 39:44.393
killed my mother.

40:47.507 --> 40:49.173
We need to talk.

40:49.175 --> 40:52.943
About the 800-pound gun in the room.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.001
I'm working on my compromise skills.

41:18.003 --> 41:19.570
Okay.

41:51.103 --> 41:53.603
Looks like your first
lead surgery went well.

41:53.605 --> 41:57.307
I didn't have a first lead surgery.

41:57.309 --> 41:59.508
Yes. It went very well.

42:03.148 --> 42:05.915
Can I check your other breast?
