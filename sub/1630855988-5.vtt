WEBVTT

01:44.366 --> 01:45.826
Good morning, Church.

01:45.826 --> 01:47.828
I'm sorry to ask
for such an early start,

01:47.828 --> 01:49.371
but the dinner
is almost upon us.

01:49.371 --> 01:50.665
Of course.

01:50.665 --> 01:52.582
Has Mrs. Bruce been shown
everything about the house

01:52.582 --> 01:53.584
she needs to know?

01:53.584 --> 01:54.667
Yes, ma'am.

01:54.667 --> 01:56.211
Mrs. Herrick was very kind.

01:56.211 --> 01:58.255
And she will be here
to help on the day.

01:58.255 --> 02:00.716
Oh. And we borrowed
enough extra footmen?

02:00.716 --> 02:03.009
Mrs. Fish and Mrs. Depew
were quite obliging.

02:03.009 --> 02:05.011
And all the footmen have
come up from 61st Street.

02:05.011 --> 02:06.764
I must decide on the service.

02:11.101 --> 02:13.061
What's all this?

02:13.061 --> 02:14.605
Have you two been here
all night?

02:14.605 --> 02:16.064
Not all night.

02:16.064 --> 02:19.609
We were out for most of it
and we've only just got back.

02:19.609 --> 02:21.444
Church, I need you
to order the carriage

02:21.444 --> 02:24.364
to take Mr. Larry and Mr. Keene
to the station in Providence.

02:24.364 --> 02:25.658
- Very good, ma'am.
- Mm.

02:25.658 --> 02:27.492
So you're banishing us?

02:27.492 --> 02:28.911
Is this what they taught you
at Harvard?

02:28.911 --> 02:30.287
How to get drunk?

02:30.287 --> 02:31.871
That's a pretty fair assessment.

02:31.871 --> 02:33.541
Wouldn't you say so, Malcolm?

02:33.541 --> 02:36.000
You find it funnier than I do.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.128
Leave it.

02:38.712 --> 02:40.296
Mr. Keene,
I wonder if Larry and I could

02:40.296 --> 02:41.840
have a few moments together?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.050
Of course.

02:43.050 --> 02:45.969
I'll get changed and pack
my things, Mrs. Russell.

02:45.969 --> 02:48.096
And I'm sorry about the glass.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.854
You can take a cab home
when you get to New York.

02:54.854 --> 02:57.022
And what about the dinner
for the Duke?

02:57.022 --> 02:58.899
I thought my presence
was required.

02:58.899 --> 03:00.442
Not if you behave like this.

03:01.359 --> 03:03.862
It was just a glass, Mother.

03:03.862 --> 03:05.990
How long do you plan
to keep playing the fool?

03:05.990 --> 03:07.366
I don't know.

03:07.366 --> 03:09.826
I suppose until
it stops being fun.

03:09.826 --> 03:12.705
It's no fun for me,
I assure you.

03:12.705 --> 03:15.124
I know you despised her.

03:15.124 --> 03:17.168
Mrs. Blane wasn't right for you.

03:17.168 --> 03:19.085
That's all I'll say
on the subject.

03:19.085 --> 03:21.713
You have to admit you're
pleased she's broken my heart.

03:21.713 --> 03:23.632
I won't admit
anything of the sort.

03:23.632 --> 03:25.801
I only ever want what's best
for my children.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.515
It will do you good
to be away from Newport.

03:31.515 --> 03:34.392
There aren't any reminders
of her in New York.

03:34.392 --> 03:36.103
Now go and get ready.

03:42.401 --> 03:44.986
You're kind to fit me in
before you leave for Newport.

03:44.986 --> 03:46.656
You must have so much to do.

03:46.656 --> 03:50.117
We're mainly going for
Mrs. Russell's famous dinner.

03:50.117 --> 03:52.702
She's really making
a splash with her Duke.

03:52.702 --> 03:54.288
I'm sorry you won't be there.

03:54.288 --> 03:56.207
I hardly know her,

03:56.207 --> 03:58.208
but Oscar thinks
he should have been asked.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.460
I dare say Mrs. Russell
had her reasons.

04:01.712 --> 04:03.922
I know he was running after
Mrs. Russell's daughter

04:03.922 --> 04:07.385
before he met me,
so perhaps that's why.

04:07.385 --> 04:09.178
Oscar liked her,

04:09.178 --> 04:10.554
but you surely
don't want a man

04:10.554 --> 04:13.224
who's never been interested
in a woman before.

04:13.224 --> 04:15.058
No, of course not.

04:15.058 --> 04:17.143
But I worry about his motives.

04:17.143 --> 04:20.605
After all, Gladys Russell
will be very rich.

04:20.605 --> 04:23.150
And so will you, of course.

04:24.193 --> 04:26.778
Is he just a fortune hunter?

04:26.778 --> 04:29.407
If he is,
he wouldn't be the first,

04:29.407 --> 04:31.492
but I don't want
to burn my wings again.

04:33.284 --> 04:35.245
I'm very fond of Oscar.

04:35.245 --> 04:37.540
He's clever and funny.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.500
And I'm sure he'll do well.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.917
But there's no rush.

04:40.917 --> 04:43.002
Take your time
in getting to know him.

04:43.002 --> 04:45.631
Then come to your own conclusions.

04:45.631 --> 04:47.173
You're right.

04:47.173 --> 04:49.759
There's no rush.
And I do like him.

04:50.970 --> 04:52.596
And now I should be
on my way.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.432
Ah, Miss Beaton.

04:54.432 --> 04:55.850
I was just seeing her out.

04:55.850 --> 04:59.061
No need. I know my way.

04:59.061 --> 05:01.147
Thank you, Aurora.

05:01.147 --> 05:02.480
Mr. Fane.

05:08.028 --> 05:09.613
I wish you'd come in earlier.

05:09.613 --> 05:10.822
Why?

05:10.822 --> 05:13.659
Because I've had a very
uncomfortable few minutes.

05:13.659 --> 05:15.243
Oh?

05:15.243 --> 05:17.412
She suspects Oscar's motives
in his pursuit of her.

05:18.830 --> 05:20.624
I warned you
not to get involved.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.961
He's my cousin, and I must
help him any way I can.

05:23.961 --> 05:26.422
And I think he's really
very fond of her.

05:26.422 --> 05:27.923
You mean you hope he is.

05:30.842 --> 05:32.678
Am I late?

05:32.678 --> 05:34.804
We were sorting out
the library.

05:34.804 --> 05:36.681
They'll have you
beating the carpets next.

05:36.681 --> 05:40.645
John, please give
Miss Marian some tea.

05:40.645 --> 05:42.188
And then would you leave us?

05:42.188 --> 05:43.396
Why must he leave us?

05:43.396 --> 05:45.023
Because I have
something to say.

05:45.023 --> 05:47.151
Gracious.
Should I leave you too?

05:47.151 --> 05:48.360
No.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.363
I want you and Marian to stay.

05:51.488 --> 05:53.448
As my niece and nephew,

05:53.448 --> 05:56.117
you're the closest I'll ever
come to having children.

05:56.117 --> 05:57.828
This is very melodramatic.

05:57.828 --> 05:59.829
Are we to witness your will?

05:59.829 --> 06:01.331
I'm surprised
what you're going to leave

06:01.331 --> 06:03.291
will warrant three signatures.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.293
Mama, let her speak.

06:07.837 --> 06:10.549
You all know
the Reverend Mr. Forte.

06:10.549 --> 06:12.885
We certainly do.
What about him?

06:12.885 --> 06:16.347
Well, the thing is...

06:16.347 --> 06:18.932
This is like
extracting teeth.

06:18.932 --> 06:21.686
He has asked me to marry him.

06:21.686 --> 06:23.062
And I have said yes.

06:24.646 --> 06:25.647
What?

06:25.647 --> 06:27.065
You heard me.

06:27.065 --> 06:28.358
How lovely.

06:28.358 --> 06:30.111
Aunt Ada,
this is wonderful news.

06:30.111 --> 06:31.612
Yes, I'll ring the bell.

06:31.612 --> 06:33.239
We must open some champagne.

06:33.239 --> 06:34.532
You will not ring the bell.

06:34.532 --> 06:36.283
We will not open any champagne.

06:36.283 --> 06:37.742
When was this decided?

06:37.742 --> 06:38.911
A few days ago.

06:38.911 --> 06:40.913
When is the wedding
to take place?

06:40.913 --> 06:43.498
- Next week.
- Next week?

06:43.498 --> 06:45.626
God in heaven, why the rush?

06:45.626 --> 06:48.169
I've been waiting
my entire life for this.

06:48.169 --> 06:50.588
I don't need a long engagement.

06:50.588 --> 06:53.676
Luke's curate will perform
the ceremony,

06:53.676 --> 06:55.636
then we'll return to 61st Street

06:55.636 --> 06:57.263
for a modest wedding breakfast.

06:57.263 --> 06:58.514
It sounds lovely.

06:58.514 --> 07:01.725
I'll ask friends and cousins
if they can spare the time.

07:01.725 --> 07:04.144
I'm going to ask Bannister
and Mrs. Bauer

07:04.144 --> 07:06.147
since they've been with us
for so many years.

07:06.147 --> 07:08.898
And Bridget will be there
to check my appearance.

07:08.898 --> 07:10.651
Do you think Miss Scott
would come?

07:10.651 --> 07:12.152
I am sure she would want to,

07:12.152 --> 07:14.280
but she's still on her
assignment in Tuskegee.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.115
Miss Scott won't be
the only one absent.

07:21.829 --> 07:23.414
You're not coming
to the wedding?

07:23.414 --> 07:25.331
No.

07:25.331 --> 07:27.501
And just in case there
is any misunderstanding,

07:27.501 --> 07:29.044
Oscar will not be there either.

07:29.044 --> 07:30.879
- Mama.
- But I--

07:30.879 --> 07:33.882
I had hoped that Oscar would
take me down the aisle.

07:33.882 --> 07:35.091
I'd be honored.

07:35.091 --> 07:37.928
My son will not participate
in your tomfoolery.

07:37.928 --> 07:40.348
Mama, this is harsh,
even for you.

07:40.348 --> 07:41.974
Well, I'll be
your maid of honor.

07:41.974 --> 07:44.977
Will you indeed?
You're very calm and collected.

07:44.977 --> 07:46.978
Did you know
what Ada was going to say?

07:46.978 --> 07:49.940
Marian encouraged me
to tell you.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.817
We hoped you'd be happy for me.

07:51.817 --> 07:53.943
Why, when you're making
a terrible mistake?

07:53.943 --> 07:57.239
What do you know about marriage
or the duties of a wife?

07:57.239 --> 07:58.658
You're a spinster.

07:58.658 --> 08:00.868
And you've always been
a spinster.

08:00.868 --> 08:02.787
Why must you be so unkind?

08:02.787 --> 08:04.704
You're right.

08:04.704 --> 08:09.752
I have a great deal to learn,
which I'm looking forward to.

08:09.752 --> 08:12.338
Please don't spoil it for me.

08:14.298 --> 08:17.301
There's a cab outside
for Mr. Oscar.

08:17.301 --> 08:19.387
- Thank you.
- What about you, Bannister?

08:19.387 --> 08:21.681
Did you know
Miss Ada is engaged

08:21.681 --> 08:23.641
to marry
the Reverend Mr. Forte?

08:23.641 --> 08:24.974
Oh.

08:24.974 --> 08:26.601
Congratulations, Miss Ada.

08:26.601 --> 08:28.062
Do not congratulate her.

08:28.062 --> 08:30.313
- I'm sorry?
- Rescind your congratulations.

08:30.313 --> 08:32.024
Aunt Agnes, this is silly.

08:32.024 --> 08:34.275
Please do not tell me
how to speak to my own butler!

08:35.193 --> 08:36.737
My apologies, Miss Ada,

08:36.737 --> 08:39.948
but I must cancel
my congratulations

08:39.948 --> 08:41.783
at Mrs. Van Rhijn's request.

08:41.783 --> 08:43.993
I quite understand, Bannister.

08:43.993 --> 08:45.663
I'm going up.

08:45.663 --> 08:48.791
My head feels like
a beating drum.

08:51.876 --> 08:53.838
I am so sorry, Aunt Ada.

08:53.838 --> 08:55.714
Perhaps she'll come around.

09:03.639 --> 09:06.642
- Oh, dear.
- Don't weaken.

09:06.642 --> 09:09.979
Not when your happiness
is close enough to touch.

09:09.979 --> 09:11.396
But Agnes--

09:11.396 --> 09:13.481
Aunt Agnes is strong.

09:13.481 --> 09:14.734
She'll get used to it.

09:14.734 --> 09:17.360
She can punch nails through
a wall with her bare hands

09:17.360 --> 09:18.778
and not notice.

09:18.778 --> 09:22.158
She could certainly
punch me through a wall.

09:22.158 --> 09:25.201
And it sounds like
she intends to do just that.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.793
Is it your goal
to work at a hotel?

09:33.793 --> 09:35.421
I hope so.

09:35.421 --> 09:37.798
When I passed the test
to get into Tuskegee,

09:37.798 --> 09:39.842
I thought now
I can learn a trade.

09:39.842 --> 09:41.969
So I won't have to look after
white folks' children

09:41.969 --> 09:43.803
for the rest of my life.

09:43.803 --> 09:45.848
But in order to do that,
you'd have to move to the city.

09:45.848 --> 09:47.349
I don't mind.

09:47.349 --> 09:49.976
Ah, well, what's David
have to say about it?

09:49.976 --> 09:52.562
- We ain't got married yet.
- Mm-hmm.

09:54.065 --> 09:57.485
I'd like to be
on my own for a bit,

09:57.485 --> 09:59.528
like Miss Scott.

09:59.528 --> 10:02.739
She gets to travel for her work
all the way from New York.

10:02.739 --> 10:04.699
How'd you get your job?

10:04.699 --> 10:08.328
Um, well, I went to school,
studied, worked hard,

10:08.328 --> 10:09.913
sent out plenty
of query letters.

10:09.913 --> 10:10.998
Mm.

10:10.998 --> 10:13.708
Mr. Fortune made me an offer,
and here I am.

10:13.708 --> 10:15.919
You're lucky to be
from the north.

10:15.919 --> 10:16.920
You should come back

10:16.920 --> 10:18.755
and teach a newspaper
writing class down here.

10:18.755 --> 10:19.757
Yes.

10:19.757 --> 10:21.175
Oh, yes.

10:21.175 --> 10:22.425
Oh, well, tell us
about New York City.

10:22.425 --> 10:23.511
Go ahead.

10:23.511 --> 10:24.636
Go on.

10:24.636 --> 10:27.431
Well, it's very big and busy.

10:27.431 --> 10:29.225
I like your menu, Borden,

10:29.225 --> 10:31.894
but I'm not sure we're
quite there with the savory.

10:31.894 --> 10:33.103
The Duke is English.

10:33.103 --> 10:34.562
I thought he'd like
deviled kidneys.

10:34.562 --> 10:37.358
Possibly, but I doubt
our American guests would.

10:37.358 --> 10:39.193
Have you enlisted
all the chefs you'll need?

10:39.193 --> 10:42.195
I've taken on five
and I've tested them all.

10:42.195 --> 10:44.698
Thank you.

10:44.698 --> 10:46.116
I think we'll use
the Bernardaud china

10:46.116 --> 10:47.450
with the St. Louis glass.

10:47.450 --> 10:49.453
Very good, madam.

10:49.453 --> 10:51.079
The Duke's room is ready

10:51.079 --> 10:52.622
if madam would care
to inspect it.

10:52.622 --> 10:54.291
So is the room for his valet.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.960
And don't forget the flowers.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.005
Mrs. Bruce, my one
remaining worry is Adelheid.

10:59.005 --> 11:00.172
She tries her best,

11:00.172 --> 11:01.966
but her skill with a tiara
is limited.

11:01.966 --> 11:04.051
She's perfectly adequate
as a maid for Miss Gladys,

11:04.051 --> 11:05.261
but I need more.

11:05.261 --> 11:07.054
She was only ever meant
to be temporary

11:07.054 --> 11:08.764
while we found a successor
to Miss Turner.

11:08.764 --> 11:10.015
But here we are months later,

11:10.015 --> 11:11.726
and I've done nothing
to find a new one.

11:11.726 --> 11:12.976
It's entirely my fault.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.396
I can make enquiries
in the town.

11:15.396 --> 11:17.606
Do that.
We have a few days yet.

11:17.606 --> 11:18.982
But nothing must go wrong.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.692
Of course, ma'am.

11:25.573 --> 11:28.616
Are you all right?
You seem a little forlorn.

11:28.616 --> 11:31.329
You can read me so well,
Miss Beaton.

11:31.329 --> 11:33.789
I'm in the middle
of a family drama.

11:33.789 --> 11:36.291
- Can I help?
- Not really.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.835
My aunt is getting married,

11:37.835 --> 11:40.378
but my mother has forbidden me
to go to the wedding.

11:40.378 --> 11:41.964
Why?

11:41.964 --> 11:43.882
She's taken against him,
I suppose.

11:43.882 --> 11:45.217
Oh, how sad.

11:45.217 --> 11:46.677
Your poor aunt.

11:46.677 --> 11:49.055
Miss Beaton,
are you a romantic?

11:49.055 --> 11:50.263
What woman isn't?

11:50.263 --> 11:51.891
You've inspired me.

11:51.891 --> 11:54.352
I shall defy my mother
and go anyway,

11:54.352 --> 11:56.019
but only
if you'll come with me.

11:57.062 --> 11:58.355
I'd be happy to,

11:58.355 --> 12:00.650
especially since you're doing me
such a good service today.

12:05.403 --> 12:06.781
Mr. Peter Barnes.

12:06.781 --> 12:08.574
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Barnes.

12:08.574 --> 12:09.657
And thank you for letting me

12:09.657 --> 12:11.327
drag you away
from your duties.

12:11.327 --> 12:14.205
I suppose Mrs. Russell
is as demanding as usual?

12:14.205 --> 12:16.081
I'm glad to see you too,
Miss Turner--

12:16.081 --> 12:19.377
or I should say
Mrs. Winterton now.

12:19.377 --> 12:20.877
But you're right
about Mrs. Russell,

12:20.877 --> 12:23.880
and I'm afraid I can't stay
more than a minute.

12:28.176 --> 12:29.720
How are the preparations
going for her dinner

12:29.720 --> 12:31.179
next week?

12:31.179 --> 12:34.016
Everyone's in a fizz
about entertaining a duke--

12:34.016 --> 12:36.768
Mr. Church more than
the others, you can imagine.

12:36.768 --> 12:38.187
Good old Mr. Church--

12:38.187 --> 12:40.272
never one to play down
his own importance.

12:41.399 --> 12:43.234
But I need you
to do me a favor--

12:43.234 --> 12:44.984
a paid favor, of course.

12:44.984 --> 12:46.695
What are old friends for?

12:46.695 --> 12:48.363
You won't be working alone.

12:48.363 --> 12:51.491
Mr. Borden has hired
some chefs to help him.

12:51.491 --> 12:54.996
And one of them,
a Mr. Schneider,

12:54.996 --> 12:57.247
is working for me.

12:57.247 --> 12:59.542
This grows more intriguing
by the minute.

13:05.338 --> 13:07.591
- Hello, Mr. Crowther.
- Ah, Miss Beaton.

13:07.591 --> 13:09.176
It's always a pleasure
to see you again.

13:09.176 --> 13:10.552
I wish I could believe that.

13:10.552 --> 13:12.220
You must be so bored
having to explain

13:12.220 --> 13:13.805
the whole thing every time.

13:13.805 --> 13:15.265
That's why I brought
Mr. Van Rhijn.

13:15.265 --> 13:16.475
How do you do?

13:16.475 --> 13:18.853
He is going to try and stop me
feeling like a fool.

13:18.853 --> 13:20.896
I'm not sure
he should be here.

13:20.896 --> 13:23.690
- You can trust me implicitly.
- Please let him stay.

13:29.446 --> 13:32.073
This is highly unusual.

13:32.073 --> 13:33.659
Please sit down.

13:35.411 --> 13:37.079
Can I offer you
any refreshment?

13:37.079 --> 13:38.413
No, thank you.

13:38.413 --> 13:40.583
But I'd love to know
more about the company.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.793
Uh, here's a booklet,
if you'd like to read it.

13:43.793 --> 13:45.211
I would.

13:45.211 --> 13:46.964
Miss Beaton has told me
about your plans

13:46.964 --> 13:49.342
to take over the Chicago
and Atlantic Railway.

13:50.259 --> 13:51.342
Has she, indeed?

13:51.342 --> 13:52.553
Was I wrong?

13:52.553 --> 13:54.388
Not wrong, exactly.

13:54.388 --> 13:55.513
But it's going through?

13:55.513 --> 13:57.266
Oh, yes, most definitely.

13:57.266 --> 13:58.684
You have all the money
you need?

13:58.684 --> 14:00.310
We have nearly
all the money we need.

14:00.310 --> 14:03.147
We should reach our target
in the next couple of weeks.

14:03.147 --> 14:05.858
And Mr. Gould is satisfied?

14:05.858 --> 14:08.818
Heavens,
you are well informed.

14:08.818 --> 14:11.489
I'm afraid I tell him
everything these days.

14:11.489 --> 14:12.989
Please don't be angry with me.

14:14.699 --> 14:17.328
I would just ask
Mr. Van Rhijn to keep silent

14:17.328 --> 14:19.788
about any information
you may give him.

14:19.788 --> 14:23.751
We cannot risk wrecking
the deal at the last moment.

14:23.751 --> 14:27.254
I'll be as silent as the grave,
I promise.

14:28.172 --> 14:31.717
Miss Ada has asked
for a tray in her room.

14:31.717 --> 14:34.261
I don't understand.
She's not ill.

14:34.261 --> 14:35.637
She didn't say.

14:35.637 --> 14:37.264
She's well enough to eat.

14:37.264 --> 14:40.142
Shall I tell Mrs. Bauer
to prepare a tray?

14:41.267 --> 14:42.895
Yes, thank you.

14:44.855 --> 14:46.273
Do you know what this is about?

14:48.149 --> 14:49.652
You are many things,
Aunt Agnes,

14:49.652 --> 14:51.695
but I'd never describe you
as obtuse.

14:51.695 --> 14:53.447
Mm. Explain yourself.

14:53.447 --> 14:54.991
It's the way you spoke
to Aunt Ada

14:54.991 --> 14:56.783
that keeps her in her room.

14:56.783 --> 14:59.870
She's finally found the man
she wants to marry.

14:59.870 --> 15:01.956
Can't you just accept it?

15:01.956 --> 15:04.542
You've not forgotten that
you live here at my pleasure?

15:04.542 --> 15:06.127
Do you really want to quarrel

15:06.127 --> 15:08.421
with your only
surviving sibling?

15:08.421 --> 15:10.506
This marriage
would be a disgrace.

15:11.881 --> 15:14.176
What would our parents think

15:14.176 --> 15:16.262
if I were to say nothing
and let this happen?

15:16.262 --> 15:19.055
So you try to please the dead
by bullying the living?

15:19.055 --> 15:19.973
Oh.

15:19.973 --> 15:23.978
You might not care what
I think or how Aunt Ada feels,

15:23.978 --> 15:26.439
but I'm certain you care
what everyone else will say.

15:26.439 --> 15:28.482
And to the outside world,
it will seem that

15:28.482 --> 15:29.899
you are petulant and angry

15:29.899 --> 15:32.320
because Ada is no longer
at your beck and call.

15:41.119 --> 15:43.288
Will Miss Marian
also be having a tray

15:43.288 --> 15:44.915
in her room, ma'am?

15:44.915 --> 15:46.166
Hmph!

15:49.754 --> 15:51.714
It is now
the largest building

15:51.714 --> 15:53.757
in the town of Tuskegee.

15:53.757 --> 15:57.260
Unfortunately,
Mr. Porter could not be here,

15:57.260 --> 16:01.390
but we thank him for his
generosity and public spirit.

16:01.390 --> 16:04.434
So without further ado,
I present to you

16:04.434 --> 16:07.145
the A.H. Porter Dormitory.

16:13.651 --> 16:15.487
I'm going to go talk
to Mr. Washington.

16:15.487 --> 16:17.239
All right.
I'll get some quotes.

16:20.534 --> 16:22.118
Oh, David. Hello.

16:22.118 --> 16:23.913
Do you mind if I get a few
quotes for the newspaper?

16:23.913 --> 16:25.121
Not at all.
Not at all.

16:25.121 --> 16:28.166
So how does it feel
to be able to attend class

16:28.166 --> 16:29.834
and live in a building

16:29.834 --> 16:32.254
you helped create
with your own hands?

16:32.254 --> 16:34.048
Mm. It's very moving.

16:34.048 --> 16:37.468
In fact, I didn't expect it
to be so emotional.

16:37.468 --> 16:38.676
Getting weepy, David?

16:41.596 --> 16:44.892
I'm proud to know
that we really did that.

16:44.892 --> 16:47.018
It makes me feel like
we could do anything.

16:47.018 --> 16:50.313
And what do you plan to do
with your Tuskegee diploma?

16:50.313 --> 16:53.901
I'd like to have my own farm
so I could support a family.

16:53.901 --> 16:56.070
I met your girlfriend.

16:56.070 --> 16:57.655
I'd also like to use my farm

16:57.655 --> 16:59.365
to help out with
our family business.

16:59.365 --> 17:01.951
- And what's that?
- My mama started a restaurant.

17:01.951 --> 17:03.536
I plan on supplying them
with the harvest

17:03.536 --> 17:04.829
from the crop on my land.

17:04.829 --> 17:06.871
Mm.
Well, I wish you all the best.

17:06.871 --> 17:07.872
Thank you.

17:07.872 --> 17:09.082
You should visit
my mama's place.

17:09.082 --> 17:10.668
Oh, yes, we might
take you up on that.

17:10.668 --> 17:12.545
But first, Mr. Washington
wants to give us a tour.

17:12.545 --> 17:14.588
Of course.
Thank you again, David.

17:14.588 --> 17:16.048
- It was nice seeing y'all.
- Take care.

17:16.048 --> 17:17.717
I'll tell my mama
to look out for you.

17:17.717 --> 17:18.842
Yes, sir.

17:20.260 --> 17:22.054
Take these for me, would you?

17:25.182 --> 17:26.183
Hello.

17:26.183 --> 17:28.060
Ah, Miss Brook.

17:30.562 --> 17:32.689
Mr. Russell.

17:32.689 --> 17:33.774
What a surprise.

17:33.774 --> 17:35.484
I thought you were spending
the summer in Newport.

17:35.484 --> 17:37.778
Unfortunately,
my plans changed.

17:37.778 --> 17:39.029
Unfortunately?

17:39.029 --> 17:40.573
You don't want to hear it.

17:40.573 --> 17:42.449
But I do.

17:42.449 --> 17:44.242
It wasn't very original--

17:44.242 --> 17:47.037
lovers meet,
lovers part, boo hoo.

17:47.037 --> 17:48.830
I know how that plays out.

17:48.830 --> 17:50.165
Of course.

17:50.165 --> 17:52.000
You told me the night
of Gladys' ball.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.793
And now we're even,

17:53.793 --> 17:56.839
twin sufferers on
the cruel carousel of life.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.758
Let's be comrades
in arms instead.

18:00.926 --> 18:02.219
Where are you going?

18:02.219 --> 18:04.138
Just to the park
to get some flowers

18:04.138 --> 18:05.723
for my painting class
this afternoon.

18:05.723 --> 18:07.224
I'll come too,
if you'll have me.

18:10.311 --> 18:13.104
So what will you do,
now you're back in New York?

18:13.104 --> 18:15.816
Well, no doubt
father will have some ideas,

18:15.816 --> 18:17.610
but we'll see.

18:23.281 --> 18:24.574
Can I help you, ma'am?

18:24.574 --> 18:26.451
I wanted to check that
everything is under control.

18:26.451 --> 18:27.787
Certainly, ma'am.

18:28.787 --> 18:31.165
Oh, Mrs. Bruce, have you got
anywhere with finding a maid?

18:31.165 --> 18:33.584
We have a hairdresser
who will place your tiara

18:33.584 --> 18:35.169
and then stay
for the rest of the evening

18:35.169 --> 18:37.087
to help any lady
whose hair may be in trouble.

18:37.087 --> 18:39.256
I feel like a racehorse
approaching the starting gate.

18:39.256 --> 18:40.507
And you'll be a winner,
ma'am.

18:40.507 --> 18:41.716
Nothing can stop you now.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.311
Schneider!
Is that sauce ready yet?

18:52.311 --> 18:53.812
I've got it here for you
to taste, Mr. Borden.

18:58.901 --> 18:59.818
Mmm.

18:59.818 --> 19:01.654
Take those up to the rose room
right away.

19:01.654 --> 19:04.489
Mrs. Bruce, is it true
you've hired a new maid?

19:04.489 --> 19:06.324
I was going to tell you.

19:06.324 --> 19:08.326
She's only going to arrange
the mistress's hair

19:08.326 --> 19:09.619
and place her tiara.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.246
I could have done it.
I usually do.

19:11.246 --> 19:13.832
I know, but this is
a special occasion.

19:13.832 --> 19:15.543
You'd learn something
if you watch.

19:25.885 --> 19:29.390
They told me someone was here,
but not that it was you.

19:30.223 --> 19:31.766
Mrs. Nelson is quite the baker,

19:31.766 --> 19:34.812
and she insists on bringing me
her work to taste.

19:34.812 --> 19:36.605
- Would you like one?
- No.

19:36.605 --> 19:37.856
Is everything all right?

19:37.856 --> 19:39.025
No, it is not.

19:39.858 --> 19:41.110
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:46.032 --> 19:48.783
Please, sit down.

19:56.332 --> 19:57.752
How can I help?

19:58.836 --> 20:00.921
I gather you and Ada
plan to marry.

20:02.423 --> 20:03.799
I'm relieved she's told you.

20:03.799 --> 20:06.551
You are aware that she has
no money to speak of.

20:06.551 --> 20:09.805
Mrs. Van Rhijn, I love her.

20:09.805 --> 20:11.807
I never expected
to fall in love at my age,

20:11.807 --> 20:13.808
but I had not then met Ada.

20:13.808 --> 20:16.312
Love seldom
survives marriage.

20:16.312 --> 20:18.648
I'm sorry if that was
your experience.

20:18.648 --> 20:20.483
But why must you do it
so quickly?

20:21.275 --> 20:23.735
Am I to understand that
you are against the plan?

20:23.735 --> 20:24.986
How perceptive.

20:26.697 --> 20:28.783
I don't intend
to take her away from you.

20:28.783 --> 20:30.533
Ada is with me
every day and night.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.119
Are you saying
that won't change?

20:32.119 --> 20:33.996
There will be changes, yes.

20:33.996 --> 20:35.790
But I mean to retire
in New York.

20:35.790 --> 20:37.583
I will never ask her
to leave the city.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.876
Maybe not, but she will be
gone from my house,

20:39.876 --> 20:41.461
leaving me alone.

20:41.461 --> 20:43.089
Because that is what I will be.

20:43.089 --> 20:44.423
Alone.

20:45.590 --> 20:47.510
You have your son
and your niece.

20:47.510 --> 20:50.512
Children marry and go.

20:50.512 --> 20:51.931
Ada...

20:55.101 --> 20:57.644
Is the only family
that I could rely on.

20:59.814 --> 21:02.441
It was Ada who was there
at Oscar's birth.

21:03.858 --> 21:06.612
We buried our parents together.

21:08.114 --> 21:10.156
She's my only true friend.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.577
We both love Ada.

21:13.577 --> 21:14.662
That is clear.

21:14.662 --> 21:16.371
Then stop being so selfish.

21:17.748 --> 21:19.499
I'm not the selfish one here.

21:19.499 --> 21:21.543
And the fact is
you have a choice.

21:21.543 --> 21:25.964
Would you like to be
a part of our life or not?

21:25.964 --> 21:27.758
Because I am not going anywhere.

21:27.758 --> 21:29.884
Marriage takes priority.

21:29.884 --> 21:31.511
God's command is clear.

21:31.511 --> 21:33.723
"Therefore man shall leave
his father and mother,

21:33.723 --> 21:37.059
and shall cleave unto his wife:
and they shall be one flesh."

21:41.354 --> 21:42.857
Have you nothing more to say?

21:44.190 --> 21:47.152
Not if you've given God
the last word.

21:47.152 --> 21:49.195
How can I answer that?

21:52.158 --> 21:53.867
How are things in Pittsburgh?

21:53.867 --> 21:55.036
On the brink.

21:55.036 --> 21:56.370
I'll have to go down there.

21:56.370 --> 21:58.621
What did you want
to see me about?

21:58.621 --> 22:00.583
I need your help.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.250
You know I'm a trustee
of the new Brooklyn Bridge?

22:02.250 --> 22:03.919
Which is almost finished.

22:03.919 --> 22:06.339
Yes, but there seem to be
more meetings than ever.

22:06.339 --> 22:08.841
And with Pittsburgh
ready to explode,

22:08.841 --> 22:10.592
I wondered if
you might represent me,

22:10.592 --> 22:12.261
now you're back in New York.

22:12.261 --> 22:15.181
I haven't given up on
architecture, you know.

22:15.181 --> 22:16.556
This won't take long.

22:16.556 --> 22:17.849
And you've studied engineering.

22:17.849 --> 22:19.268
You can say sensible things.

22:20.977 --> 22:22.812
What are the meetings about?

22:22.812 --> 22:24.774
The final design details.

22:24.774 --> 22:26.941
And we've had some deaths
and injuries--

22:26.941 --> 22:29.361
always part of it,
I'm sad to say--

22:29.361 --> 22:32.197
and a chief engineer,
Mr. Roebling,

22:32.197 --> 22:33.949
who has not proved satisfactory.

22:33.949 --> 22:36.535
- What do you mean?
- He's never there.

22:36.535 --> 22:39.454
I'm told his home is
an absolute hive of activity.

22:39.454 --> 22:41.331
But if he's working hard--

22:41.331 --> 22:43.458
and I suppose he must be--

22:43.458 --> 22:44.794
why aren't we allowed
to question him?

22:45.878 --> 22:47.045
Does he give a reason?

22:47.045 --> 22:48.964
Norman Tate,
who manages the trustee,

22:48.964 --> 22:50.673
says it's his health.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.677
He fell ill soon after
the building started.

22:52.677 --> 22:54.553
Well, he's done
a terrific job.

22:54.553 --> 22:55.929
You can't argue with that.

22:56.847 --> 22:59.557
It's already one of
the main sights in the city.

22:59.557 --> 23:02.561
Mm. I'll write to Tate
and tell him what we're doing.

23:02.561 --> 23:03.812
But see what you can find out.

23:05.021 --> 23:06.816
Go to Roebling's house.

23:06.816 --> 23:08.776
Beard him in his den.

23:13.781 --> 23:15.157
I wish you'd let me
wear the blue.

23:15.157 --> 23:16.367
No.

23:16.367 --> 23:18.285
This is what I've ordered,
and this is what you'll wear.

23:18.285 --> 23:19.996
What's wrong
with the blue dress?

23:19.996 --> 23:21.788
It's not how
I want you to look.

23:21.788 --> 23:23.124
It's fussy and girlish

23:23.124 --> 23:24.542
when it needs to be
simple and elegant.

23:24.542 --> 23:26.085
So I'm not allowed
to dress myself?

23:26.085 --> 23:27.586
You want to look good,
don't you?

23:27.586 --> 23:28.963
Last week,
the "Tribune" named you

23:28.963 --> 23:31.048
as one of the best-dressed
debutantes of the year.

23:31.048 --> 23:33.050
Do you think those things
happen by accident?

23:33.050 --> 23:34.885
I'd still like to choose
my own clothes.

23:34.885 --> 23:37.513
But your choice
would be wrong, my dear.

23:37.513 --> 23:39.307
Happily, you have me
to guide you.

23:39.307 --> 23:40.724
Trust me.

23:47.772 --> 23:49.649
I'm sorry...

23:49.649 --> 23:53.112
for losing control
of my emotions.

23:53.112 --> 23:56.782
If ever there was a time
to do so, I'd say it's now.

23:56.782 --> 24:00.202
But what are we going to do
about Agnes?

24:01.369 --> 24:03.455
This is the hardest choice
you'll ever face,

24:03.455 --> 24:04.915
but you're not alone.

24:05.832 --> 24:07.917
Luke,

24:07.917 --> 24:12.338
I don't know if this is
the right time for this,

24:12.338 --> 24:15.133
but I also don't know

24:15.133 --> 24:17.802
if there will ever be
a right time.

24:17.802 --> 24:20.347
That's where faith comes in.

24:20.347 --> 24:23.601
Have I told you that I didn't
want to move to New York?

24:23.601 --> 24:24.894
Why not?

24:24.894 --> 24:26.936
Because I loved
my parish in Boston.

24:26.936 --> 24:29.564
I asked if I could stay.

24:29.564 --> 24:31.150
I even wrote to the bishop.

24:31.150 --> 24:32.859
What did the bishop say?

24:32.859 --> 24:35.071
He reminded me
of when Jesus asked

24:35.071 --> 24:38.073
that the cup be taken
from his lips.

24:38.073 --> 24:40.492
Well, we know
how that turned out.

24:40.492 --> 24:41.952
Mm. Yes.

24:41.952 --> 24:44.120
So I obeyed the order.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.874
And I had faith.

24:48.376 --> 24:50.585
And my reward has been

24:50.585 --> 24:53.172
more than I could ever
have imagined.

24:54.339 --> 24:58.134
I never dreamt that
I might still fall in love.

24:59.469 --> 25:00.388
Not now.

25:03.057 --> 25:04.266
But--

25:04.266 --> 25:07.894
Ada, please,
don't decide anything

25:07.894 --> 25:09.896
without talking
to Marian first.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.816
Yes, all right.

25:26.706 --> 25:27.706
Mr. Russell.

25:27.706 --> 25:28.915
Ah, Mr. Russell.

25:30.458 --> 25:31.752
What a surprise.

25:31.752 --> 25:33.295
But you got
my father's letters?

25:33.295 --> 25:35.255
And we're delighted
to have you represent him,

25:35.255 --> 25:37.174
but I didn't know
you were coming here.

25:37.174 --> 25:38.591
I am Norman Tate.

25:38.591 --> 25:40.094
And this is Mrs. Roebling.

25:40.094 --> 25:42.847
I came to pay my respects
to Mr. Roebling.

25:42.847 --> 25:45.516
I gather he rarely comes
to the bridge or to your office.

25:45.516 --> 25:47.310
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

25:47.310 --> 25:49.895
but I'm afraid
my husband is away.

25:49.895 --> 25:51.104
On bridge business?

25:51.104 --> 25:53.107
Not exactly.

25:53.107 --> 25:54.232
He's in Newport.

25:54.232 --> 25:56.986
Mr. Brandon is here, ma'am.
He says that--

25:56.986 --> 25:58.361
Yes, I know about this.

25:58.361 --> 25:59.864
Will you excuse me, gentlemen?

26:01.531 --> 26:03.575
Mr. Brandon,
let's see what you've brought.

26:06.329 --> 26:08.956
Does Mr. Roebling spend
a lot of time in Newport?

26:08.956 --> 26:10.915
I believe
he's fond of the place.

26:10.915 --> 26:13.585
Even now, when the bridge
is about to open?

26:13.585 --> 26:15.336
How does he manage
the construction when he's away?

26:15.336 --> 26:16.756
He delegates.

26:16.756 --> 26:19.425
He has his deputies,
his helpers, and his wife.

26:19.425 --> 26:21.926
She's a good organizer.

26:21.926 --> 26:23.428
She must be.

26:23.428 --> 26:26.014
She knows
his way of thinking.

26:26.014 --> 26:27.849
I assume
Mr. Roebling will be there

26:27.849 --> 26:29.392
for the opening ceremonies?

26:29.392 --> 26:31.728
We are marking the occasion
with a reception

26:31.728 --> 26:34.105
here in this house.

26:34.105 --> 26:35.440
I hope you and your father
will come.

26:36.441 --> 26:38.402
But he'll be at the bridge
beforehand?

26:38.402 --> 26:39.611
Ah, I doubt it.

26:39.611 --> 26:42.281
And now, I'm terribly sorry,
but I must go.

26:42.281 --> 26:43.866
I'm sure you understand.

26:43.866 --> 26:45.867
I'll send you notice
of our meetings.

26:58.129 --> 26:59.799
And we'll erect
a pavilion at the terminal

26:59.799 --> 27:02.718
just here
at the dedication ceremony.

27:02.718 --> 27:05.136
Take these plans now
and alert Mr. Harris

27:05.136 --> 27:07.472
that I will come
to inspect it at 3:00.

27:07.472 --> 27:09.057
That should be enough for now,

27:09.057 --> 27:11.268
but you'll have
the final paperwork on Monday.

27:12.603 --> 27:13.687
Oh, Mr. Russell.

27:13.687 --> 27:16.398
Is this where
Mr. Roebling works?

27:17.483 --> 27:20.568
This is where
the work is done, yes,

27:20.568 --> 27:23.113
but I'm afraid
I have some errands to run.

27:23.113 --> 27:25.198
Has Mr. Tate gone?

27:25.198 --> 27:26.533
He has.

27:26.533 --> 27:28.576
And don't worry.
I'm going too.

27:28.576 --> 27:30.704
Thank you for seeing me,
Mrs. Roebling.

27:40.088 --> 27:41.172
Come in.

27:42.716 --> 27:43.843
Oh!

27:43.843 --> 27:45.386
Thank goodness it's you.

27:46.594 --> 27:47.805
I've chosen this.

27:47.805 --> 27:50.807
And Bridget is going
to cheer it up a little.

27:50.807 --> 27:53.351
We've bought veiling
and some things for a headdress.

27:53.351 --> 27:54.686
It'll be charming.

27:54.686 --> 27:56.564
Bridget, could you please
give us a minute?

27:56.564 --> 27:57.732
Yes, miss.

27:59.899 --> 28:01.443
Thank you.

28:05.864 --> 28:07.741
I daren't sit
with all these pins.

28:07.741 --> 28:09.368
Oh.

28:11.287 --> 28:13.581
Who knows if
I'll ever even wear it?

28:15.166 --> 28:16.875
What do you mean?

28:16.875 --> 28:19.210
Perhaps it's time
I face the facts.

28:19.210 --> 28:20.503
What are you saying?

28:21.630 --> 28:24.216
I can't turn my back
on my sister.

28:24.216 --> 28:27.136
So you're going
to give up Luke Forte

28:27.136 --> 28:28.803
just to satisfy Aunt Agnes?

28:28.803 --> 28:32.724
No, not give up exactly.

28:32.724 --> 28:35.310
But perhaps
if we postpone things

28:35.310 --> 28:36.729
until Agnes comes around--

28:36.729 --> 28:37.855
You can't live your life

28:37.855 --> 28:39.522
waiting for
Aunt Agnes's approval.

28:39.522 --> 28:41.274
- But she's so--
- No.

28:41.274 --> 28:42.942
This quarrel is of her making.

28:42.942 --> 28:45.071
You have done nothing wrong.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.364
I won't let you spoil
your future.

28:47.364 --> 28:50.618
But she refuses
even to be there.

28:50.618 --> 28:53.328
I have no one to take me
down the aisle.

28:53.328 --> 28:56.040
Cousin Dashiell has invited me
to a picnic luncheon.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.999
I'll ask him to give you away.

28:57.999 --> 29:00.294
Do you think he would?

29:00.294 --> 29:01.504
Oh.

29:01.504 --> 29:03.047
It does sound respectable.

29:03.047 --> 29:04.839
I'll go fetch Bridget.

29:04.839 --> 29:07.510
We need this dress
to be finished in time.

29:09.387 --> 29:11.722
Luke told me to speak to you

29:11.722 --> 29:13.474
before I made a final decision.

29:14.432 --> 29:15.810
Now I know why.

29:15.810 --> 29:17.852
Then I'm very glad I was here.

29:29.490 --> 29:32.827
My, my, aren't we all
busy little bees?

29:32.827 --> 29:35.787
Jack, still tinkering with that?

29:35.787 --> 29:37.248
I believe
I've solved the problem,

29:37.248 --> 29:38.957
- if you want to try it?
- I don't think so.

29:38.957 --> 29:40.709
I'm known for my punctuality.

29:40.709 --> 29:43.754
I don't want to take a chance
on a homemade contraption.

29:43.754 --> 29:46.590
I'll test it,
if you'll allow me.

29:46.590 --> 29:48.759
Hm, maybe
Miss Armstrong's right.

29:48.759 --> 29:50.344
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

29:50.344 --> 29:51.595
Ow.

29:51.595 --> 29:53.054
What is it?

29:53.054 --> 29:54.347
I've just pricked myself,
is all.

29:54.347 --> 29:55.975
Don't bleed on that veil.

29:55.975 --> 29:57.268
You're wasting your time.

29:57.268 --> 29:59.103
Miss Ada doesn't have the nerve

29:59.103 --> 30:01.396
to marry a man
Mrs. Van Rhijn dislikes.

30:01.396 --> 30:03.690
- But what if they do marry?
- Which they won't.

30:03.690 --> 30:05.567
Mrs. Van Rhijn may not need
as many servants

30:05.567 --> 30:06.818
once her sister's gone.

30:06.818 --> 30:08.403
Miss Marian will still be here.

30:08.403 --> 30:10.447
Won't she wed soon too?

30:10.447 --> 30:11.781
Then what becomes of us

30:11.781 --> 30:14.577
when there's only one person
left to serve?

30:14.577 --> 30:17.913
Maybe Mr. Oscar will find
a bride and live in the house.

30:17.913 --> 30:19.289
Well, I doubt that.

30:38.517 --> 30:40.477
<i>I suppose you've heard
of Johann Most?</i>

30:40.477 --> 30:41.561
The German anarchist?

30:41.561 --> 30:43.689
Anarchist
and man of violence.

30:43.689 --> 30:46.108
He likes to celebrate the murder
of the Russian emperor.

30:46.108 --> 30:48.026
He preaches savagery
and violence

30:48.026 --> 30:50.570
to bring political change.

30:50.570 --> 30:51.613
What about him?

30:51.613 --> 30:53.324
He's been in Pittsburgh.

30:53.324 --> 30:55.493
His agents are still there

30:55.493 --> 30:56.994
poisoning the minds
of your workers.

30:56.994 --> 30:59.413
I suppose
we shouldn't be surprised

30:59.413 --> 31:01.039
after the Labor Day march
last year.

31:01.039 --> 31:04.167
And the message is simple--
if you want revolution,

31:04.167 --> 31:06.586
you must take up your weapons
and use them.

31:06.586 --> 31:08.714
Is Henderson convinced,
I wonder?

31:08.714 --> 31:10.841
The leaders go where
the workers take them.

31:10.841 --> 31:12.134
And their demands
keep getting louder--

31:12.134 --> 31:14.094
constant chants of,
"Eight, eight, eight."

31:14.094 --> 31:15.178
What's that?

31:15.178 --> 31:16.847
Eight hours of work,
eight hours of sleep,

31:16.847 --> 31:19.183
and eight hours
of "what you will."

31:19.183 --> 31:22.477
It's the "what you will" that's
proving the sticking point.

31:22.477 --> 31:24.063
Would it be
so terrible for them

31:24.063 --> 31:25.398
to have some time
with their families?

31:25.398 --> 31:27.440
Yes, it would be terrible
because it would lead, first,

31:27.440 --> 31:29.150
two lower profits
and, finally, to ruin,

31:29.150 --> 31:30.985
violence, bloodshed, and death.

31:30.985 --> 31:32.488
Please don't hold back
on my account.

31:32.488 --> 31:33.572
I mean it.

31:33.572 --> 31:35.658
Any concession now
could only spell weakness.

31:35.658 --> 31:38.494
Weakness is
the harbinger of chaos.

31:38.494 --> 31:40.453
One blink,
and you'll lose the war.

31:47.378 --> 31:49.504
Mr. Van Rhijn,
I'm not sure about this.

31:49.504 --> 31:51.589
Why?

31:51.589 --> 31:54.217
You're trying to find the money
to complete your takeover.

31:54.217 --> 31:55.720
I have funds to invest.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.013
What can be the problem?

31:57.013 --> 31:59.015
But this is
a closed partnership

31:59.015 --> 32:00.765
with a limited number
of investors,

32:00.765 --> 32:03.393
all well known to each other.

32:03.393 --> 32:05.645
Well, I know you.

32:05.645 --> 32:07.814
You know me.
And we both know Miss Beaton.

32:08.983 --> 32:12.320
Just let me invest,
and we'll all make some money.

32:17.825 --> 32:20.119
Well, your picnic
was a wonder--

32:20.119 --> 32:23.955
not really a picnic at all,
more an open-air banquet.

32:23.955 --> 32:25.290
Hardly.

32:26.541 --> 32:27.793
And now
you've brought me home.

32:27.793 --> 32:29.503
You've gone to so much trouble.

32:29.503 --> 32:31.672
He likes to take trouble
for you.

32:32.631 --> 32:36.217
Which makes me feel
all the more ungrateful.

32:36.217 --> 32:38.971
I'm afraid
I've got a favor to ask.

32:38.971 --> 32:40.430
Name it.

32:40.430 --> 32:42.932
Would you walk Aunt Ada
down the aisle?

32:42.932 --> 32:44.894
Aunt Agnes has
forbidden Oscar to,

32:44.894 --> 32:46.144
and now she's wavering.

32:46.144 --> 32:47.229
But if I could say
you'd be there,

32:47.229 --> 32:48.356
it would give her courage.

32:48.356 --> 32:50.273
Of course I will.

32:50.273 --> 32:52.735
And Frances can be
a flower girl.

32:52.735 --> 32:54.028
Could I really?

32:54.028 --> 32:55.695
That's a lovely idea.

32:55.695 --> 32:58.783
I'm surprised to hear
Aunt Agnes is against marriage.

32:58.783 --> 33:01.242
Not for everyone.
Just Aunt Ada.

33:03.204 --> 33:04.497
That's a relief.

33:10.877 --> 33:12.338
Is Mrs. Roebling here?

33:12.338 --> 33:13.631
I'll announce you, sir.

33:13.631 --> 33:14.965
It's all right, Philip.

33:14.965 --> 33:16.425
I'll deal with this.

33:17.843 --> 33:19.511
Mr. Russell.

33:19.511 --> 33:21.389
I wasn't expecting you.

33:21.389 --> 33:23.265
You weren't expecting me?
Really?

33:24.974 --> 33:26.726
Not so soon.

33:26.726 --> 33:27.937
Not without warning.

33:27.937 --> 33:29.772
But you knew I would guess.

33:30.980 --> 33:32.358
I thought you might.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.235
May I see the workroom again?

33:41.366 --> 33:42.743
How did you know?

33:44.370 --> 33:46.287
Because nothing made sense.

33:46.287 --> 33:48.749
The deputies who knew
your husband's mind,

33:48.749 --> 33:50.750
his tastes, and his ideas--

33:50.750 --> 33:54.338
the person who knew all that
best was you and only you.

33:54.338 --> 33:56.715
In all the years
since we started building,

33:56.715 --> 33:59.050
none of the other trustees
ever came to this house--

33:59.050 --> 34:00.261
not one.

34:00.261 --> 34:01.804
Mm.

34:01.804 --> 34:04.055
Well, now I have come.

34:04.055 --> 34:06.891
So tell me, please.

34:08.018 --> 34:09.769
Where did you study engineering,

34:09.769 --> 34:11.896
and how was it possible?

34:11.896 --> 34:14.358
When my father-in-law
was first commissioned

34:14.358 --> 34:18.738
to design the bridge,
my husband and I went to Europe

34:18.738 --> 34:21.073
to study what it would entail--

34:21.073 --> 34:24.409
stress analysis,
cable construction,

34:24.409 --> 34:26.703
calculating catenary curves,
and the rest.

34:26.703 --> 34:28.246
So you learned those things?

34:29.039 --> 34:30.249
I know it is all considered

34:30.249 --> 34:32.293
beyond the grasp
of a mere woman,

34:32.293 --> 34:33.377
but I did.

34:33.377 --> 34:35.463
Then my father-in-law died.

34:35.463 --> 34:38.506
And my husband was made
chief engineer,

34:38.506 --> 34:40.718
but he fell ill soon after.

34:40.718 --> 34:42.052
And then you took over?

34:42.052 --> 34:43.136
Not at first.

34:43.136 --> 34:45.306
We worked together.

34:45.306 --> 34:48.850
I would deliver
his orders and designs,

34:48.850 --> 34:50.269
but he got worse...

34:50.269 --> 34:51.937
And then it was just you.

34:53.355 --> 34:56.441
Last year, some of the board
wanted to replace him.

34:56.441 --> 34:59.110
But Mr. Tate and I
persuaded them not to.

34:59.110 --> 35:02.655
So you would continue
in charge of the work.

35:02.655 --> 35:03.948
And Mr. Tate knew?

35:03.948 --> 35:05.325
Oh, several of them knew.

35:05.325 --> 35:07.036
But they couldn't
make it public?

35:07.036 --> 35:08.287
Of course not.

35:11.581 --> 35:13.917
This bridge will be
one of the finest in the land,

35:13.917 --> 35:16.128
in the world.

35:16.128 --> 35:18.922
You should be proud of it,
but I suppose you can't be.

35:18.922 --> 35:21.133
No one must know
a woman was the engineer

35:21.133 --> 35:23.386
behind the bridge.

35:23.386 --> 35:26.806
They might not even want
to walk across it.

35:26.806 --> 35:31.142
It's a shame,
an unjust shame.

35:35.982 --> 35:39.150
So he proposes that
you should move to San Francisco

35:39.150 --> 35:41.487
and never see
your daughter again?

35:41.487 --> 35:44.740
That's it, sir, in a nutshell.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.533
Well, I should be
very sorry to lose you,

35:46.533 --> 35:47.868
but I'm sure you know that.

35:48.660 --> 35:51.162
I've not decided yet.

35:51.162 --> 35:54.208
I told him I needed to discuss
his offer with Flora

35:54.208 --> 35:55.626
before I made any decisions,

35:55.626 --> 35:59.087
but he says that
she has no wish to speak to me.

35:59.087 --> 36:00.672
Do you believe that?

36:00.672 --> 36:01.966
I don't know what to believe,

36:01.966 --> 36:04.969
which is why I feel
I must hear it from her.

36:04.969 --> 36:07.221
Then it doesn't seem
unreasonable to me.

36:09.265 --> 36:10.598
There you are.

36:11.309 --> 36:13.394
I'm so pleased you're here.

36:15.812 --> 36:17.313
I shouldn't be.

36:17.313 --> 36:19.108
Pittsburgh is about
to blow sky high.

36:19.108 --> 36:20.567
Don't think about that now.

36:20.567 --> 36:22.485
Think about it tomorrow.

36:22.485 --> 36:23.904
Right.

36:23.904 --> 36:25.448
Are you ready to go down?

36:28.117 --> 36:29.535
Guests are arriving.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.245
Are the oysters laid out?

36:31.245 --> 36:33.079
Yes.

36:33.079 --> 36:34.622
These are done.

36:34.622 --> 36:35.999
Oh, welcome back, Mr. Watson.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.335
Peter.

36:37.335 --> 36:38.878
Where are we with
the first course?

36:38.878 --> 36:40.129
Final touches, sir.

36:40.129 --> 36:42.338
How was your journey,
Mr. Watson?

36:42.338 --> 36:44.549
Very pleasant.
Thank you, Mrs. Bruce.

36:44.549 --> 36:47.135
I always enjoy traveling in
the master's private rail car.

36:47.135 --> 36:49.220
I'm sure you do.

36:51.639 --> 36:52.933
Schneider!

36:52.933 --> 36:54.392
Coming, sir.

37:07.657 --> 37:10.117
Mr. and Mrs. Frederic Bronson.

37:15.789 --> 37:17.958
Mr. and Mrs. Duncan Elliot.

37:19.710 --> 37:21.796
Mr. McAllister,
it's so good of you to come.

37:21.796 --> 37:24.256
I never like
to miss a red carpet,

37:24.256 --> 37:27.426
and certainly not one which
can boast an English duke.

37:27.426 --> 37:29.095
Yes, where is
that duke of yours?

37:29.095 --> 37:30.804
I don't think we can
claim him as our own.

37:30.804 --> 37:33.057
- I would.
- He'll be down momentarily.

37:33.057 --> 37:34.933
Is Mrs. Astor coming?

37:34.933 --> 37:36.643
She's opened Beechwood,
so I asked her,

37:36.643 --> 37:38.270
but she made an excuse.

37:38.270 --> 37:39.813
She's a little cross
with me right now.

37:39.813 --> 37:42.357
Well, I can understand why,

37:42.357 --> 37:45.026
but she is missing out
on what may be

37:45.026 --> 37:47.028
the event of the Newport season.

37:47.028 --> 37:48.948
Everyone's talking about it,

37:48.948 --> 37:50.950
especially those
who weren't invited.

37:50.950 --> 37:53.619
Naturally, Mrs. Astor
will feign indifference,

37:53.619 --> 37:56.038
then she'll force
all the details out of me.

38:01.668 --> 38:03.169
It looks perfect.

38:03.169 --> 38:05.381
And all the right people
are here.

38:05.381 --> 38:08.134
Even some who were on
the other side in the opera war.

38:08.134 --> 38:10.552
My dear, the way to win a war

38:10.552 --> 38:13.264
is to bring out
your biggest weapon.

38:13.264 --> 38:15.682
And yours is the duke.

38:15.682 --> 38:18.144
Now, I hope I'm happy
with my placement.

38:18.144 --> 38:19.227
I think you will be.

38:20.563 --> 38:23.898
His Grace,
the Duke of Buckingham.

38:23.898 --> 38:25.692
Excuse me.

38:27.152 --> 38:29.613
Mrs. Russell,
my room is a work of art.

38:29.613 --> 38:32.116
And I see everything's
exquisite here too.

38:32.116 --> 38:33.450
We do what we can.

38:33.450 --> 38:35.619
But I hope we haven't
overwhelmed you with our guests?

38:35.619 --> 38:36.912
Of course not.

38:36.912 --> 38:38.538
May I present
Mr. and Mrs. Fane.

38:38.538 --> 38:40.833
- How do you do?
- Mr. Fane. Mrs. Fane.

38:40.833 --> 38:42.292
Do you think Newport
will live up to

38:42.292 --> 38:43.835
your expectations, Duke?

38:43.835 --> 38:45.920
I'm sure Mrs. Russell's
Newport will.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.590
- Well said.
- But not our Newport?

38:50.843 --> 38:52.845
May I present
Mr. and Mrs. Winterton.

38:52.845 --> 38:54.262
I know the Wintertons.

38:54.262 --> 38:56.098
I hope I'll see more of you
while I'm here.

38:56.098 --> 38:59.310
Well, you'll see as much of us
as we're allowed.

38:59.310 --> 39:01.144
What Mrs. Winterton
means is--

39:01.144 --> 39:03.314
I don't think you've met
our daughter, Gladys.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.443
Miss Russell.

39:07.443 --> 39:08.777
How do you do?

39:08.777 --> 39:10.071
Gladys!

39:11.029 --> 39:12.365
You look divine.

39:12.365 --> 39:14.032
- Oh.
- Don't worry.

39:14.032 --> 39:15.533
You're sitting next to her
at dinner.

39:18.954 --> 39:20.581
They're going in.

39:29.048 --> 39:31.008
Something odd is going on.

39:31.008 --> 39:32.217
I could have sworn
I saw that man

39:32.217 --> 39:34.553
put something in the sauce
for the first course.

39:37.639 --> 39:39.099
Schneider!

39:39.099 --> 39:40.434
What's he talking about?

39:40.434 --> 39:42.895
- I don't know, Mr. Borden.
- Let's taste it.

39:44.938 --> 39:46.524
Revolting!

39:46.524 --> 39:50.068
Everyone,
cancel the first course.

39:50.068 --> 39:51.695
Schneider,
get away from that food.

39:51.695 --> 39:54.197
- I'll deal with you later.
- I'll tell the footmen.

40:10.338 --> 40:12.507
Gladys, you're there.

40:12.507 --> 40:13.925
I thought I'd be
with the younger group.

40:13.925 --> 40:15.845
No, you're there.

40:39.659 --> 40:40.953
They're seated, Mr. Borden.

40:40.953 --> 40:42.830
All right, we--
we must start serving.

40:42.830 --> 40:45.166
- This tastes good to me.
- We'll start with the soup.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.584
But is it hot enough?

40:46.584 --> 40:48.294
Rather him than me.

40:48.294 --> 40:49.961
Peter, come take this up.

40:54.174 --> 40:56.718
I think Peter and that man
Schneider are up to something.

40:56.718 --> 40:58.638
They were whispering
before Peter took the soup.

40:58.638 --> 41:00.264
I tasted the soup.
It's fine.

41:00.264 --> 41:02.183
I don't know.
Something's not right.

41:02.183 --> 41:03.099
Who's Peter serving?

42:02.159 --> 42:04.912
Mrs. Winterton,
are you all right?

42:04.912 --> 42:06.288
Why shouldn't I be?

42:06.288 --> 42:07.957
You seem rather agitated.

42:07.957 --> 42:09.749
Well, I'm not.

42:13.212 --> 42:14.879
Jerusalem artichoke
and truffle?

42:14.879 --> 42:15.881
Oh.

42:15.881 --> 42:17.216
What a wonderful way
to begin.

42:17.216 --> 42:20.802
I'd forgotten that was
the first course, but good.

42:20.802 --> 42:22.930
Now, I mustn't monopolize you.

42:22.930 --> 42:24.140
Gladys.

42:25.683 --> 42:27.852
Do you spend a lot of time
in Newport, Miss Russell?

42:27.852 --> 42:29.270
My mother seems to like it,

42:29.270 --> 42:30.896
so I suppose
that's what will happen.

42:30.896 --> 42:33.314
Until you make your own life.

42:33.314 --> 42:36.152
Do any of us ever really
make our own lives?

42:36.152 --> 42:38.403
That's a deep question
when we've barely begun to eat.

42:39.946 --> 42:41.741
Your wife and daughter
seem to have the duke

42:41.741 --> 42:43.326
sewn up between them.

42:43.326 --> 42:45.618
I expect a lot of women here
must be rather annoyed.

42:45.618 --> 42:47.163
Mm.

42:47.163 --> 42:48.706
But I suppose
Bertha knows what she's doing.

42:48.706 --> 42:50.666
I think you can
safely say that.

42:50.666 --> 42:52.959
Are you sure you want
to waste your time

42:52.959 --> 42:54.544
on little old me?

42:54.544 --> 42:56.881
Wouldn't you rather speak
to your other neighbor?

42:56.881 --> 42:59.967
No. Let Gladys entertain him
for a change.

42:59.967 --> 43:03.011
Then we must hope he finds
Gladys entertaining.

43:10.310 --> 43:12.729
Oh, everything was delicious,
Mrs. Sturt.

43:12.729 --> 43:14.190
Oh, good.

43:14.190 --> 43:16.275
Now, I hope y'all saved
room for dessert,

43:16.275 --> 43:17.860
'cause we're giving you
the special treatment today.

43:17.860 --> 43:19.194
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

43:20.529 --> 43:22.448
A colored woman
newspaper writer.

43:22.448 --> 43:23.698
Now I've seen it all.

43:23.698 --> 43:26.744
Well, we were quite impressed
with your son at Tuskegee.

43:26.744 --> 43:29.621
- That's right.
- David is my heart.

43:29.621 --> 43:31.457
He's going to do more
than I could ever imagine.

43:31.457 --> 43:32.958
- Mm.
- Mrs. Sturt!

43:32.958 --> 43:34.585
Mm.
I'll be back with some dessert.

43:36.170 --> 43:37.253
I'm bursting.

43:37.253 --> 43:39.506
Ooh, I think if we want
to leave this place,

43:39.506 --> 43:41.508
we're going to have
to clean our plates.

43:41.508 --> 43:43.219
I would tell you
to loosen your belt.

43:43.219 --> 43:45.012
I wish I had that option.

43:47.347 --> 43:49.391
Has anyone ever been
part of an evening

43:49.391 --> 43:52.560
as beautifully managed
as this one?

43:52.560 --> 43:54.939
How lucky are the people
of Newport

43:54.939 --> 43:59.026
to number Mrs. George Russell
among your leading citizens?

43:59.026 --> 44:00.444
- Very lucky, indeed.
- Hear, hear.

44:00.444 --> 44:03.280
- Mrs. Russell.
- Hear, hear.

44:09.202 --> 44:10.371
Thank you all.

44:10.371 --> 44:13.289
And thank you to our charming
and generous guest of honor.

44:13.289 --> 44:15.959
Ladies, why don't we let
the men enjoy their port?

44:23.842 --> 44:25.094
Well, it was a good dinner.

44:25.094 --> 44:26.512
You must admit that.

44:26.512 --> 44:28.847
I wouldn't admit it
if they tore my fingernails off

44:28.847 --> 44:30.141
to make me.

44:31.392 --> 44:32.684
Hm.

44:35.687 --> 44:38.190
So have you enjoyed yourself
on our trip?

44:38.190 --> 44:40.693
Mm. More than that.

44:40.693 --> 44:42.903
I've been inspired,

44:42.903 --> 44:45.281
especially by
the female students.

44:45.281 --> 44:48.993
They have such ambition
despite their circumstances.

44:48.993 --> 44:50.410
They're fearless.

44:50.410 --> 44:51.786
And so are you.

44:51.786 --> 44:54.080
Oh, am I?

44:54.080 --> 44:55.665
Well, I like that
you think that,

44:55.665 --> 44:58.836
but there is so much more
I want to do.

44:58.836 --> 45:01.296
My lack of courage
keeps getting in the way.

45:01.296 --> 45:03.049
Well, I certainly believe
you can accomplish

45:03.049 --> 45:04.258
everything you want.

45:07.386 --> 45:08.636
Bea!

45:12.475 --> 45:13.601
Hey, Bea!

45:15.645 --> 45:16.895
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

45:16.895 --> 45:20.858
Bea, you outdid yourself
with this chicken.

45:22.860 --> 45:24.110
How may I help you out?

45:24.987 --> 45:27.490
Why you sound all formal, Bea?

45:28.448 --> 45:30.909
We've been knowing each other
our whole lives.

45:30.909 --> 45:32.703
I am doing business.

45:33.871 --> 45:35.456
What can I get you, Mr. Mason?

45:37.041 --> 45:38.542
You know what I like.

45:39.250 --> 45:42.129
Why don't you go on back,
cook me up something extra tasty?

45:46.258 --> 45:47.592
What are you looking at?

45:47.592 --> 45:48.886
Nothing.

45:49.761 --> 45:52.098
- You calling me "nothing"?
- Mr. Mason, don't start.

45:52.098 --> 45:53.808
Let me fix you up some chicken
to take home.

45:54.933 --> 45:57.018
What if I want to stay
and eat it here?

45:58.270 --> 45:59.981
Are you trying to tell me
what to do?

45:59.981 --> 46:01.314
No, sir.

46:01.314 --> 46:03.109
You think things
are different now,

46:03.109 --> 46:04.193
but they really ain't.

46:06.403 --> 46:07.655
You hear me talking to you, girl?

46:07.655 --> 46:09.698
Mr. Mason, come on--

46:09.698 --> 46:11.616
Stop it!

46:11.616 --> 46:12.826
What'd you say?

46:16.747 --> 46:17.997
No.

46:20.125 --> 46:21.501
Let her go.

46:21.501 --> 46:23.879
Don't get smart with me.

46:23.879 --> 46:25.296
Do you know who I am?

46:25.296 --> 46:26.715
They're from out of town.

46:26.715 --> 46:29.384
- Shut your mouth.
- You better sit down, boy.

46:29.384 --> 46:30.885
This here is Mason Sturt.

46:30.885 --> 46:32.012
He's the county commissioner.

46:32.012 --> 46:33.389
Sturt?

46:33.389 --> 46:34.932
I might have to teach you
a lesson

46:34.932 --> 46:36.641
so you understand your place.

46:49.947 --> 46:50.990
You better go!

46:53.701 --> 46:54.618
Come on, quickly.

46:54.618 --> 46:56.787
You can run,
but we'll find you!

47:01.166 --> 47:02.585
I'll go get
the rest of my things.

47:02.585 --> 47:04.128
Quickly.

47:04.128 --> 47:05.837
Our man will take you
to where you can shelter,

47:05.837 --> 47:06.921
and tomorrow morning,

47:06.921 --> 47:08.215
he'll take you
to the first train.

47:10.050 --> 47:11.761
I'm so sorry to put you
in this position.

47:11.761 --> 47:13.346
We don't have time
for apologies.

47:13.346 --> 47:14.763
You need to get on out of here.

47:16.557 --> 47:18.267
Take the low road
behind the church.

47:34.241 --> 47:36.410
It was a triumph. Congratulations.

47:36.410 --> 47:37.744
Thank you.

47:39.829 --> 47:42.249
And now I suppose
I must turn my attentions

47:42.249 --> 47:44.293
- back to Pittsburgh.
- Mm.

47:46.420 --> 47:48.630
What can I do to help?

47:48.630 --> 47:50.215
Nothing.

47:50.215 --> 47:52.175
But thank you.

47:52.175 --> 47:53.719
Do you mind?

47:57.472 --> 48:01.352
So did you get everything
you wanted from this evening?

48:02.937 --> 48:06.272
Let's just say
we are on our way.

48:11.111 --> 48:12.363
I'm going to bed.

48:12.363 --> 48:14.698
Have I told you how lovely
you look tonight?

48:14.698 --> 48:16.908
Several times.

48:22.080 --> 48:22.997
George.

48:39.723 --> 48:41.434
I hired him,
so it's my fault.

48:41.434 --> 48:43.852
But we avoided
a major disaster.

48:43.852 --> 48:46.396
Thanks to Mr. Watson's
sharp eyes.

48:46.396 --> 48:49.317
And you really think
Mrs. Winterton was behind it?

48:49.317 --> 48:51.109
Schneider works
part time for her.

48:51.109 --> 48:52.611
And we all know
she and Peter Barnes

48:52.611 --> 48:53.695
have kept in touch.

48:53.695 --> 48:57.490
So we thwarted
Miss Turner's revenge.

48:58.491 --> 49:01.703
I suppose you'll sack
Peter Barnes, Mr. Church?

49:01.703 --> 49:04.040
How would you say it?
Con gusto.

49:16.718 --> 49:18.720
Come on out, boy!

49:18.720 --> 49:20.972
Where you at now?

49:20.972 --> 49:22.891
We're gonna kill your ass.

49:22.891 --> 49:24.517
Get that noose.

49:24.517 --> 49:26.227
Get your ass out here, boy.

49:28.271 --> 49:29.856
Where you at?
Get out here.

49:48.666 --> 49:51.211
They've gone. We're safe.

49:56.175 --> 49:59.804
I won't feel safe
until I'm back in the city.

49:59.804 --> 50:01.305
My mother warned me,

50:01.305 --> 50:03.598
but I never could have
imagined this.

50:03.598 --> 50:05.850
This is my fault.

50:05.850 --> 50:07.019
I grew up with these people.

50:07.019 --> 50:09.312
I should have protected you
and held my tongue.

50:10.855 --> 50:12.858
But that's not who you are.

50:16.069 --> 50:18.154
And that's not
who you are either.

50:21.449 --> 50:22.951
That's why I hired you.

50:28.248 --> 50:30.792
Will things ever really change?

51:22.053 --> 51:23.262
You wait here, my dear.

51:31.979 --> 51:34.981
- Dashiell.
- Aunt Ada, you look wonderful.

51:34.981 --> 51:36.776
Doesn't she?

51:36.776 --> 51:38.861
Your footman is hailing a cab
for your servants.

51:38.861 --> 51:40.988
Oh, good.

51:46.785 --> 51:48.453
Have you changed your mind?

51:48.453 --> 51:49.747
Certainly not.

51:50.663 --> 51:52.540
I've just come down
to say goodbye.

51:53.708 --> 51:56.128
Dashiell, I see
they've made you an accomplice

51:56.128 --> 51:57.546
in their betrayal.

51:57.546 --> 52:00.423
Well, she must have a man
to give her away, Aunt Agnes.

52:00.423 --> 52:03.468
Surely, you can see that.

52:03.468 --> 52:06.721
No, she can't.

52:09.349 --> 52:12.061
Come on.
We don't want to be late.

52:29.577 --> 52:31.455
Et tu, Bannister?

52:33.666 --> 52:35.751
I'm going to support
Miss Ada, ma'am.

52:35.751 --> 52:37.753
And I urge you to do the same,

52:37.753 --> 52:40.088
or you may regret it
for the rest of your life.

52:45.385 --> 52:47.722
You look so pretty.

52:47.722 --> 52:50.641
- So do you, Aunt Ada.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

53:06.740 --> 53:07.992
Is it a desert out there?

53:07.992 --> 53:09.868
On the contrary.

53:09.868 --> 53:12.121
Aurora and Charles have come
with other cousins,

53:12.121 --> 53:14.290
and friends of the bridegroom,
of course...

53:14.290 --> 53:15.582
Mm-hmm.

53:15.582 --> 53:17.167
And Oscar.

53:18.502 --> 53:19.920
Oscar?

53:19.920 --> 53:21.337
The church is full of flowers

53:21.337 --> 53:23.923
and people who've come
to witness your happiness.

53:23.923 --> 53:25.634
We should go take our seats.

53:26.844 --> 53:28.929
Oh.

53:28.929 --> 53:31.806
Thank you, Mrs. Bauer.
Thank you, Bridget.

53:31.806 --> 53:33.559
My pleasure, Miss Ada.

53:33.559 --> 53:35.603
You've earned this, Miss Ada.

53:35.603 --> 53:39.105
And I wish you happiness.
Real happiness.

53:44.652 --> 53:46.237
How kind they are.

53:51.118 --> 53:53.746
- Are you nervous?
- Should I be?

53:53.746 --> 53:55.789
I have no idea,

53:55.789 --> 53:57.665
as I've never been
in your position.

53:57.665 --> 53:59.793
I thought no one would come
because of Agnes,

53:59.793 --> 54:01.503
but they have.

54:01.503 --> 54:03.756
Now I'm just excited and glad.

54:03.756 --> 54:06.258
You're so certain
about marrying Luke.

54:06.258 --> 54:08.344
You have no doubts?

54:08.344 --> 54:10.387
No.

54:10.387 --> 54:11.721
None at all.

54:13.224 --> 54:15.433
I hope that's true of me
when it's my turn.

54:15.433 --> 54:18.144
Be sure it is.

54:18.144 --> 54:21.314
Marriage is something
one should never settle for

54:21.314 --> 54:23.109
or talk oneself into.

54:23.109 --> 54:25.236
Yes?

54:25.236 --> 54:27.362
Thank you, Aunt Ada.

54:27.362 --> 54:28.864
We should go.

54:28.864 --> 54:30.031
Yes.

54:37.372 --> 54:39.291
Oscar.

54:39.291 --> 54:40.500
Here I am, Aunt Ada.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.001
Oh!

54:42.962 --> 54:45.339
I'm ready to walk you down
the aisle, if you'll have me.

54:45.339 --> 54:48.341
I was just going to say
the same thing.

54:48.341 --> 54:52.221
I had no one to take me,
and now I'm spoilt for choice.

54:52.221 --> 54:54.849
I think Oscar should do it.

54:54.849 --> 54:59.185
If only as a reward
for risking Agnes's wrath.

54:59.185 --> 55:00.854
You don't mind too much,
do you?

55:00.854 --> 55:02.480
Of course not.

55:33.512 --> 55:35.263
Thank you, my dear.

55:49.028 --> 55:51.155
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here--

56:31.362 --> 56:34.323
We are gathered together here
in the sight of God

56:34.323 --> 56:36.241
and in the face of this company

56:36.241 --> 56:40.162
to join together
this man and this woman

56:40.162 --> 56:41.831
in holy matrimony.

56:41.831 --> 56:43.708
Into this holy estate,

56:43.708 --> 56:46.710
these two persons present
come now to be joined...
