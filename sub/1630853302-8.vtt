WEBVTT

00:15.500 --> 00:17.250
We would like to say
a few words.

00:17.333 --> 00:20.000
Alejandro,
we are so proud of you.

00:20.083 --> 00:23.125
And we're so happy that
Malik is now part of our lives.

00:23.208 --> 00:24.750
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

00:24.833 --> 00:27.166
Now let's dance.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.791
- Oh!
- Hey, oh!

00:42.875 --> 00:45.125
Hey, oh!

01:00.250 --> 01:02.291
- You okay?

01:02.375 --> 01:05.125
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.125
I'm fine.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.916
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.083
You know how everything's
perfect here,

01:13.166 --> 01:15.125
and we all love each other?

01:15.208 --> 01:17.208
Yeah.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.791
You ever get the feeling
that there's...

01:19.875 --> 01:21.916
something else
that needs to be fixed?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.750
You're kidding, right?
That's a joke?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.916
Just, like, deep down
in your gut?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.208
No. Alma,
you need to trust this.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.291
Okay?

01:31.375 --> 01:32.541
- I do.
- Okay.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.208
I trust this.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.166
Press the button.

01:51.208 --> 01:52.625
Why? We're happy here.

01:52.708 --> 01:54.583
- But I'm not.
- What do you mean you're not?

02:08.041 --> 02:09.250
What?

02:09.291 --> 02:10.916
Mom?

02:11.041 --> 02:12.791
Your father
had a stroke.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.500
We're in the hospital.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.875
My God.
We'll be right there.

02:17.916 --> 02:19.916
I told you there was something
wrong with this reality.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.041
- Alma, it could have happened
in any reality.
- I don't know.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.333
Mom.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.875
- You made it.
- Of course.

02:26.958 --> 02:29.458
- Where is he?
- What's going on? Where's Dad?

02:29.541 --> 02:31.416
They took him to surgery.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.708
They found a blood clot.

02:32.791 --> 02:35.750
He's paralyzed
on his right side.

02:35.833 --> 02:37.291
He can't talk.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.291
How could he do this to me?

02:39.375 --> 02:41.083
- It's okay.
- Oh, Mom.

02:41.166 --> 02:43.250
- He'll recover.
- Okay, don't worry.
We're gonna fix this.

02:43.333 --> 02:46.041
Yeah, we'll call Rosario.
She'll know what to do.

02:46.125 --> 02:47.458
Yeah. We can start there.

02:47.541 --> 02:48.708
I'm so glad
you're all here.

02:50.333 --> 02:52.041
It's gonna be okay.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.166
I'm so sorry, Dad.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.291
- This is my fault.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.666
I shouldn't have pushed so hard.

03:26.750 --> 03:29.333
If you hadn't worn yourself out
saving Grandma Ruchel...

03:33.083 --> 03:35.416
"Don't...

03:35.500 --> 03:37.625
blame yourself."

03:39.708 --> 03:42.833
But it depleted you, Dad.

03:42.916 --> 03:49.208
Helping change my mother's life

03:49.291 --> 03:54.208
is the greatest gift
you could have give me.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.833
Don't take that away.

03:56.916 --> 03:59.333
But there has to be
something we can do.

03:59.416 --> 04:00.916
Something to change this.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.041
Right now, I need to rest.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.583
Okay.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.416
Your place is
feeling great.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.125
- You really think so?
- Yes.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.875
The energy is very good.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.875
- You're healing people here.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.708
Oh. I think I hear
Mom and Dad. Be right back.

04:25.375 --> 04:28.041
So, what happened to the door?

04:28.125 --> 04:30.250
The one you couldn't
get through?

04:32.916 --> 04:35.875
Oh. Um, my grandmother's
childhood self

04:35.958 --> 04:37.791
was trapped behind it.

04:37.875 --> 04:40.833
Uh, once we helped her forgive
herself, it rippled through,

04:40.916 --> 04:43.458
healing stuff
throughout the whole family.

04:43.541 --> 04:45.208
No big deal.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.333
Sounds like no big deal.

04:47.416 --> 04:49.708
It's been incredible.

04:49.791 --> 04:52.208
You know, until now.

04:53.333 --> 04:57.125
Don't worry. We'll help him.

05:04.250 --> 05:07.208
Mm, you're sure there was
nothing else behind the door?

05:07.291 --> 05:08.791
Yeah.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.208
Why?

05:11.291 --> 05:12.583
- No reason.

05:12.666 --> 05:16.083
- Look who's here.
- Oh, look at you.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.916
You're doing great.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.958
Hello, my love.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.541
Thank you for coming.

05:20.625 --> 05:21.625
Of course.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.458
I'm gonna grab some towels.

05:26.541 --> 05:29.333
- Okay. See you in there.
- Mm-hmm.

05:37.791 --> 05:39.541
Guys?

05:39.625 --> 05:41.416
Did you lock the closet?

06:30.666 --> 06:33.958
I'm not gonna lose him
again, Becca.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.416
You can count on that.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.583
Alma, we don't know
what's gonna happen, okay?

06:37.666 --> 06:39.083
These treatments,
they could heal him.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.250
And if they don't?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.250
There's no going back
to change this.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.208
You said yourself
that Dad told you

06:44.291 --> 06:46.083
you cannot undo this.

06:46.166 --> 06:49.208
Plus, we can't go back to a life
where Alejandro was abandoned.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.791
Right, but there's
a whole new time line now.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.041
Maybe we can find something
in here that caused the stroke,

06:54.125 --> 06:56.666
- and we just stop it.
- Well, even if
we could stop Dad

06:56.750 --> 06:58.916
from smoking and eating sugar,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.083
we're still not sure that
that would prevent this stroke.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.875
We're gonna create a time loop.

07:02.958 --> 07:04.541
- Time loop?
- We'll just live

07:04.625 --> 07:06.458
- from when we changed
the time line...
- Uh-huh.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.083
...up until
when he had the stroke.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.833
We'll just stay
in that happy zone forever.

07:10.916 --> 07:13.458
Yeah, but then
NicolÃ¡s would never grow up,

07:13.541 --> 07:16.041
and we would just be
stuck in this...

07:17.708 --> 07:19.625
Alma, don't we have to accept

07:19.708 --> 07:21.333
that hard things
are gonna happen?

07:21.416 --> 07:23.583
Like, being able to move
through this kind of stuff,

07:23.666 --> 07:26.416
- that is life.
- But not Dad dying.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.041
Why don't we just ask Dad?

07:28.125 --> 07:29.666
He probably has a million ideas.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.625
He doesn't want
to live like this.

07:33.708 --> 07:35.375
Okay.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.541
There has to be something
we can do to change this.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.750
How can we help you?

07:44.958 --> 07:47.041
"During the massage...

07:48.750 --> 07:52.458
...my mother came to me
and told me...

07:54.833 --> 07:56.791
...I will join her soon.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.625
Part of me is scared.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.500
But death is not the end.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.666
I'm ready.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.958
I think...

08:17.041 --> 08:19.666
maybe...

08:19.750 --> 08:21.208
I'm ready."

08:39.375 --> 08:40.666
You keep telling me
I'm more than just

08:40.750 --> 08:41.791
the bad choices I've made.

08:41.875 --> 08:42.958
That inside
I want to help people.

08:43.041 --> 08:44.750
Where do you think I get that?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.166
Wait. Where's Dad?

08:48.250 --> 08:49.791
There's got to be a way.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.791
Can't the you now
help the her then?

08:51.875 --> 08:52.958
Who?

08:53.041 --> 08:54.958
I mean...

08:55.041 --> 08:57.416
Do I really have to accept this?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.333
Do I?

08:59.416 --> 09:02.000
- Oh, shit. Someone's calling.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.791
Oh, my God, of course.

10:13.916 --> 10:16.833
Dad strived to do
what was right.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.291
Sometimes he got it wrong.

10:19.375 --> 10:24.666
But when he did, he was able
to see himself and try again.

10:25.666 --> 10:29.291
And not just for him,
for everyone in his life,

10:29.375 --> 10:30.875
to make our lives better.

10:30.958 --> 10:34.416
Maybe that's what we're
ultimately meant to do here.

10:35.875 --> 10:40.333
Face ourselves, for the sake
of our relationships.

10:40.416 --> 10:42.333
For the people we love.

10:42.416 --> 10:44.208
Maybe that's all that matters.

10:44.291 --> 10:48.791
These invisible threads running
between us and through us,

10:48.875 --> 10:50.583
throughout time.

10:50.666 --> 10:54.500
These invisible lines
that bind us and set us free.

10:56.958 --> 11:00.666
I'm so happy
to be tied to all of you,

11:00.750 --> 11:03.375
and I know Dad was, too.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.500
I can't believe he's gone,

11:06.583 --> 11:09.041
'cause I can still feel
the tug of that tie.

11:10.041 --> 11:13.541
But someone very cool
told me that...

11:14.916 --> 11:18.125
...part of life is accepting

11:18.208 --> 11:20.250
that bad things are
gonna happen.

11:23.125 --> 11:27.625
And finding ways...

11:27.708 --> 11:31.750
to move through them together.

11:54.416 --> 11:56.125
Aah!

11:56.208 --> 11:57.750
Having trouble
with your door again?

11:57.833 --> 12:00.541
No, I'm-I'm good.
I, um, I got it.

12:03.666 --> 12:06.166
What did you see in there?

12:06.250 --> 12:08.500
What are you afraid of?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.125
I saw my grandmother as a child.

12:16.625 --> 12:20.000
And my brother in the orphanage.

12:22.791 --> 12:25.166
And myself.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.666
From the other time line
before I came through,

12:28.750 --> 12:32.458
when I wasn't sure
if I had saved my dad or not,

12:32.541 --> 12:35.791
if I was crazy or not.

12:35.875 --> 12:40.583
She's just sitting there,
waiting for the answer.

12:42.583 --> 12:46.041
- And that scares you?
- Well, I can't go back to her.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.958
But you feel you need to?

12:49.041 --> 12:51.541
Well, my grandmother
and my brother were left behind.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.333
Ah.

12:53.416 --> 12:55.416
So, you've left yourself behind?

12:55.500 --> 12:57.458
No. I...

12:57.541 --> 12:58.833
I don't owe her anything.

12:58.916 --> 13:01.791
Oh, okay.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.416
Ooh, these are dirty.

13:08.458 --> 13:12.708
- Hey, what do you call a monkey
with bananas in her ears?
- What?

13:12.791 --> 13:15.333
Whatever you want.
She can't hear you.

13:15.416 --> 13:16.375
What is this?
What are you doing?

13:16.458 --> 13:18.625
I'm looking up jokes
for NicolÃ¡s.

13:18.708 --> 13:20.875
Well... he does love monkeys.

13:20.958 --> 13:23.666
Okay, what's red
but smells like blue paint?

13:24.708 --> 13:25.625
What?

13:25.708 --> 13:27.083
Red paint.

13:27.166 --> 13:28.458
- So, what,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.541
it's just, like, all paint?

13:30.625 --> 13:31.833
What's that supposed to mean?

13:31.916 --> 13:33.916
Alma...

13:34.000 --> 13:35.958
I thought your fog was over.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.416
It... might not be.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.333
Whoa.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.500
Alma, you have to see this.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.458
Come on.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.583
That's you.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.791
- From my old life.
- Yeah.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.958
Alma?

14:15.041 --> 14:17.041
Alma, we came to visit.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.000
Will you talk to us?

14:21.083 --> 14:23.041
You don't need to come here.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.166
We want to.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.833
You think I'm a fuckup.

14:28.916 --> 14:30.125
Mija...

14:33.291 --> 14:35.875
We want to make you better.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.375
Don't do that.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.291
God. What is the point of this?

14:40.375 --> 14:42.416
Are you hurting yourself?

14:42.500 --> 14:44.958
Get out. Get out.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.000
Get out. Get out.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.291
Get out!

14:56.041 --> 14:58.958
Oh, fuck. I have to go back.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.333
To your old time line?

15:02.416 --> 15:04.666
That's her future without me.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.291
This is what I've been feeling
needs to be fixed.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.166
Her.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.666
Me.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.333
Why is she so sad?

15:13.583 --> 15:15.708
She doesn't know
it can be better.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.958
I don't want you to go.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.416
I don't want to go, either.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.833
But I've been telling everybody
to face their truth,

15:20.916 --> 15:23.416
and now this is...

15:23.500 --> 15:25.375
this is my truth.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.666
Okay, but how are you
gonna help her?

15:29.625 --> 15:32.875
I never thought I'd be able
to accept Dad's death.

15:32.958 --> 15:36.041
But having this experience
with you...

15:36.125 --> 15:38.958
I feel different. Stronger.

15:39.041 --> 15:42.291
Our relationships feel stronger.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.916
I got to bring that to her.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.500
- Mom.
- Hmm?

16:19.500 --> 16:22.666
I just want to say it's been
really nice seeing you happy.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.458
Oh...

16:24.541 --> 16:28.375
Well, it was difficult
to lose your father,

16:28.458 --> 16:31.541
but I'm trying my best.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.541
I mean our whole lives.

16:34.875 --> 16:38.583
Seeing you and Dad together,

16:38.666 --> 16:42.208
in love, and having Alejandro
in our lives,

16:42.291 --> 16:44.500
seeing the joy
that he brings you,

16:44.583 --> 16:46.875
that he brings all of us.

16:46.958 --> 16:48.583
It's been really nice.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.250
Yes.

16:52.333 --> 16:56.208
I guess it has been
a good life. Hmm.

16:58.291 --> 17:00.750
I love you so much, Mom.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.833
You know that, right?

17:03.916 --> 17:07.500
And I'm so sorry
if I was ever mean to you.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.750
I just didn't understand

17:08.875 --> 17:10.291
everything
you were going through.

17:14.458 --> 17:17.083
I love you, too.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.625
Man, those gloves are
pretty wet, huh?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.125
I know.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.666
Okay.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.208
Here I go.

17:56.916 --> 17:58.500
Dad?

18:01.250 --> 18:03.208
Hmm.

18:06.541 --> 18:08.458
Hey.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.750
Don't forget me.

18:16.583 --> 18:17.625
How could I?

18:55.041 --> 18:57.916
Yes, Mom,
of course we're gonna be safe.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.458
Okay, so don't make any stops,

18:59.541 --> 19:01.166
but if we happen to drive
through Saltillo,

19:01.250 --> 19:02.833
stop and get some tile for you.

19:02.916 --> 19:05.125
Okay, got it.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.750
Oh, Alma's here. I got to go.

19:07.833 --> 19:10.333
She wants to talk to you.
It's Mom.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.250
- Hi, Mom.
- Mija.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.916
I was so worried about you.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.083
- Sam, too.
- Sam's there?

19:19.166 --> 19:20.750
We're so glad
that you're coming home.

19:20.833 --> 19:23.000
And we're going to get
you help, okay, mi amor?

19:23.083 --> 19:26.208
Um... okay.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.291
We can try that.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.333
That's my good girl.

19:30.416 --> 19:33.833
Okay, Sam wants to talk to you.

19:33.916 --> 19:35.541
Uh...

19:35.625 --> 19:38.083
- Hey, Alma.
- Hey.

19:38.166 --> 19:41.291
I'm really sorry things
went down the way they did.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.041
- I know.
- We can talk about it more
when you're back.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.416
I mean, only if you want to,
or whatever, n-no pressure.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.500
- We'll see.
- Okay.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.833
Well, have a fun drive back.

19:53.916 --> 19:55.625
Not fun. Safe.

19:55.708 --> 19:59.208
Right, uh, your mom is saying
don't have fun. Be safe.

19:59.291 --> 20:01.291
- I didn't say not to have fun.
Just be safe first.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.458
Um...

20:02.541 --> 20:04.291
Yeah, I-I heard her.
Bye, Sam.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.708
Bye.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.375
Did you see something?

20:34.458 --> 20:37.333
I thought I did,
but I'm not sure anymore.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.125
You want to go back?

20:41.208 --> 20:42.750
No.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.500
Let's go home.
