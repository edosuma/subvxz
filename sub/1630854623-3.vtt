WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:13.708
-Come on!

00:14.500 --> 00:15.500
Move it!

00:19.166 --> 00:20.458
No, wait for me!

00:33.041 --> 00:34.708
What is that thing?

00:36.416 --> 00:38.708
Dead. Thank fuck.

00:38.791 --> 00:40.750
Please tell me this is our world.

00:40.833 --> 00:41.833
Over there.

00:42.750 --> 00:43.875
Xin'trea.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.208
Closer, at least.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.000
The energy it's giving off,

00:51.083 --> 00:53.833
it's what you felt in the world
that Balor's beast came from.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.666
It's what's leaking into ours.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.375
Then let's get to it.

01:08.208 --> 01:10.000
-A dwarf.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.791
It's feeding time, for fuck's sake!

01:12.875 --> 01:14.416
Ah, godhead mushrooms.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.791
I'm not high, you Elven shitweasel.

01:17.750 --> 01:18.708
There!

01:20.708 --> 01:21.875
Balor's beast.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.250
We're fucked.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.916
Come with me if you want to live.

01:44.125 --> 01:47.000
Of course,
I was plannin' on watching you get eaten,

01:47.083 --> 01:50.333
till Gwen said there was
something special about you lot.

01:50.416 --> 01:51.375
Gwen?

01:55.000 --> 01:55.916
Gwen.

01:57.916 --> 01:59.208
And right she was.

01:59.791 --> 02:01.833
I'm not usually one to gush over elves,

02:01.916 --> 02:04.625
but, um, it's an honor
to feed the lot of you.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.125
Heard you'd killed
a hundred soldiers in Daédwóde

02:07.208 --> 02:10.833
after those Golden Empire wankstains
burnt down a Dwarven bank.

02:10.916 --> 02:12.166
Somethin' like that.

02:12.791 --> 02:14.291
Mighty stuff.

02:15.375 --> 02:17.375
And the Lark herself, no less.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.083
Thought you'd be shorter.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.375
Still, it's not your fault.

02:21.458 --> 02:24.041
Your exploits are becoming
more famous than your songs.

02:24.125 --> 02:26.833
They say you killed
a four-score of empire assassins

02:26.916 --> 02:29.833
sent to kill you in Inis Dubh
with just your bare hands and teeth.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.333
You killed more. Hah!

02:33.416 --> 02:34.750
Hah-hah! Knew it!

02:35.416 --> 02:36.541
Sit! Sit, sit.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.541
Please.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.250
Thanks for this.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.333
It's been days since we've had a hot meal.

02:42.416 --> 02:46.041
A meal shared is a meal well-seasoned,
as my father used to say.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.083
Not a bad spot, Meldof.

02:48.916 --> 02:49.916
So…

02:51.333 --> 02:52.625
Is it true, then?

02:53.708 --> 02:55.708
You plannin' on killing the empress?

02:55.791 --> 02:57.666
No planning about it.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.833
Mad as a bucket full of stoats.

03:00.416 --> 03:04.708
I love it! May the gods of mayhem rise up
and be forever at your backs.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.083
Xin'trea's a tough nut to crack, though,

03:08.166 --> 03:11.500
and doesn't look like
you have much in the way of an army.

03:11.583 --> 03:12.791
Doesn't matter.

03:13.333 --> 03:16.208
This one's Dog Clan,
knows a secret way in.

03:16.791 --> 03:20.416
You want to kill the empress,
you'll have to kill her monster first.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.166
You know it can turn people
into a bloodied mist, right?

03:23.250 --> 03:25.166
Wiped out the town of Gylfen in one go,
they say.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.750
Honestly,
we've no idea how to kill it.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.625
We barely escaped a monster
a tenth its size earlier.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.958
Why don't we poison a sheep
and feed it to it?

03:36.291 --> 03:38.875
-Fuck sake.
-Could work.

03:38.958 --> 03:41.958
What if we could create our own beast
to fight and kill it?

03:44.250 --> 03:45.250
How?

03:45.750 --> 03:48.125
With the heart of the creature
from the gateway,

03:48.916 --> 03:52.166
and a very… particular magic,

03:53.625 --> 03:55.000
I could become one with it.

03:56.958 --> 03:59.500
Don't remember puttin'
any godhead in that stew.

04:00.250 --> 04:03.375
-What do you mean, "become one with it"?
-Exactly that.

04:03.458 --> 04:08.375
I merge the beast's biological essence
with mine to gain its strength and power.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.541
Hopefully, that'll be enough
to kill Balor's beast.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.541
But I can't do it alone.

04:20.916 --> 04:21.916
Wh--

04:24.416 --> 04:25.375
Not again!

04:27.666 --> 04:28.708
Not again…

04:45.208 --> 04:50.125
I thought maybe you'd come back here
to make amends.

04:55.291 --> 04:59.833
I know… I haven't been back
since Mother passed.

04:59.916 --> 05:02.000
-But--
-We should never have taken you in.

05:12.541 --> 05:15.250
I never told anyone about what happened.

05:17.583 --> 05:20.458
I thought maybe if I put it away--

05:20.541 --> 05:21.833
-But you can't.

05:21.916 --> 05:22.958
I've tried.

05:29.541 --> 05:32.166
-What we did to her--
-We were trying to save her.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.458
No, she died, Syndril.

05:33.541 --> 05:34.916
And then we brought her back.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
No, whatever we brought back to life,

05:38.166 --> 05:39.666
that thing wasn't her.

05:42.583 --> 05:46.083
She died, and we should
have just left it at that.

05:48.833 --> 05:49.875
I know…

05:52.833 --> 05:56.541
I know I have no right
to expect your help,

05:57.125 --> 06:01.416
but that beast,
everything that's wrong, is because of me.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.583
Without your help, the world ends.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.750
Maybe I should just let the world end.

06:35.833 --> 06:38.083
I'm so close, Solryth.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.625
I just need to stay alive.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.291
Um…

07:31.875 --> 07:33.750
Your merging of elf and beast.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.250
If you can do it, it can't be you.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.375
It needs to be a warrior. Not a mage.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.458
One of us.

07:42.833 --> 07:45.708
Stick to your plan and destroy
the monolith after we slay the beast.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.958
Even if you do
survive the ritual…

07:49.708 --> 07:51.416
you'll probably lose who you are.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.000
Completely.

07:53.583 --> 07:57.916
Every nerve, every sinew
will be brutally corrupted.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.541
The transformation will be long.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.250
Beyond painful.

08:02.333 --> 08:05.250
Ithlinne said,
"Two apart shall become two as one."

08:05.333 --> 08:06.958
This again.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.833
I'll do it. This is my destiny.

08:09.916 --> 08:11.375
Fuck destiny.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.291
You will have time to decide.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.791
The preparation will take all night.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.125
There are feainnewedd flowers
in this cave,

08:19.208 --> 08:21.541
but I'll need you
to collect mandrake root,

08:21.625 --> 08:23.291
wolfsbane, and corpse nettle.

08:23.958 --> 08:26.791
We'll need the heart of the beast
back at the monolith brought here.

08:26.875 --> 08:29.583
-I'll get the herbs.
-You can't let her do this.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.875
The girl does what she wants.

08:34.541 --> 08:35.666
Trust me.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.375
This can't be you.

08:42.458 --> 08:43.291
Has to be me.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.083
Because some child with a sickness
babbled some prophecy nonsense?

08:46.166 --> 08:48.541
It was nonsense
when beasts didn't exist.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.291
It's more than just the prophecy.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.166
I have to atone, Fjall.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.333
In Zacaré's mists,

08:57.416 --> 09:00.375
I remembered burning a family alive
in the name of my king.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.916
It wasn't even
the worst of what I did for my clan.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.791
We've all done unspeakable things
in the name of our clans.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.625
I thought sharing my music
could fix what I did.

09:10.791 --> 09:13.583
But it will never be enough.
Sacrificing myself is the only way.

09:13.666 --> 09:14.666
No.

09:16.666 --> 09:19.291
-You bring so much hope to this world.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.375
I've seen it.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.416
I bring nothing but…

09:25.041 --> 09:26.375
I bring nothing but death.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.000
You need to live, Éile.

09:31.416 --> 09:32.625
It's okay.

09:40.541 --> 09:42.333
Fjall, all my songs are sung.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.333
Who will take the elixir?

10:02.833 --> 10:04.208
I'm going to do it.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.166
You know I'm probably dying tomorrow,
right?

10:17.458 --> 10:20.166
So where's my fucking wake,
you sad bunch of whoresons?

10:20.250 --> 10:21.333
A wake!

10:21.416 --> 10:23.208
-Yes! Yes!

10:23.666 --> 10:25.958
-Fuckin'--

10:26.041 --> 10:28.000
Where did you get all this from?

10:28.083 --> 10:30.083
Ah, just because I live in the poxy woods

10:30.166 --> 10:33.250
don't mean I got to forsake
the trappings of civilization.

10:39.583 --> 10:40.583
Mushroom?

10:43.583 --> 10:44.750
Drink with me.

11:08.916 --> 11:10.583
You make it up as you go.

11:10.666 --> 11:13.000
If you'd told me I could use my hravel
against your vaina…

11:13.083 --> 11:14.583
You said you knew how to play!

11:16.083 --> 11:17.125
I'm dealin'.

11:17.208 --> 11:20.166
We should let him cheat.
I feel bad for him.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.166
-He'll still lose.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.833
If you fell into a bucket of tits,
you'd come up holdin' a cock.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.875
-You're not drinkin'.
-One of us has to keep sharp.

11:36.791 --> 11:41.416
Even if Syndril's magic works,
we still need to get inside the palace.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.875
Tell me about the secret entrance.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.125
There is no secret entrance.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.625
And even if there was,

11:52.708 --> 11:55.166
I'd have found it and shut it down myself.

11:55.250 --> 11:58.416
So we're gonna have to fight our way
inside the walls of Xin'trea

11:58.916 --> 12:00.416
without sellswords?

12:00.916 --> 12:02.375
We'll improvise.

12:04.541 --> 12:07.291
Every time I think
I've suffered the last fool,

12:07.916 --> 12:09.791
another lands in front of me.

12:31.458 --> 12:34.958
Well done, Master Avallac'h.
Can you open a gateway?

12:35.458 --> 12:37.083
-I believe so.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.750
I mean, it all works in theory,
but I can't know for sure

12:39.833 --> 12:40.958
-until I try it myself.
-Mm.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.250
-If I could--

12:42.333 --> 12:43.750
-Thief!

12:44.666 --> 12:47.666
Did you think
that you could steal from me?

12:47.750 --> 12:48.916
Leave him!

12:50.375 --> 12:53.083
Do wait your turn, Empress.
I shall attend to you soon.

12:53.875 --> 12:57.583
Tell me, boy, is it youthful arrogance
or just naked stupidity?

12:59.166 --> 13:01.333
Shall we make this quick? Or interesting?

13:03.500 --> 13:05.458
-Interesting it is, then.

13:06.541 --> 13:09.416
Have you ever witnessed
a fool turned inside out?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.875
Want to travel to other worlds,
Master Avallac'h?

13:16.541 --> 13:18.625
-First you need to learn how to fly.

13:18.708 --> 13:20.041
No!

13:20.125 --> 13:21.666
Balor!

13:24.666 --> 13:26.333
Do it and she dies.

13:35.708 --> 13:36.541
Don't.

13:41.916 --> 13:42.916
Sorry.

13:43.375 --> 13:44.208
Go.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.791
Summon the best physic we have.
We can't lose him.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.583
You've been played.

14:05.666 --> 14:06.500
So,

14:08.041 --> 14:09.958
why does your hammer have a name?

14:10.041 --> 14:11.291
Aah…

14:12.000 --> 14:12.916
Gwen!

14:14.458 --> 14:18.708
She was the… fairest dwarf
you ever did see.

14:20.458 --> 14:23.208
-Great big baps on her.

14:23.833 --> 14:25.500
A fine silken beard too.

14:26.541 --> 14:27.791
Jealous of it, I was.

14:28.291 --> 14:31.916
I can no more sprout hair on me chin
than a king can wipe his own arse.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.000
Anyway,

14:35.583 --> 14:38.833
I was… mad in love with her.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.166
The happiest days of my life.

14:44.875 --> 14:45.875
What happened?

14:48.250 --> 14:49.250
The usual.

14:51.083 --> 14:54.458
Elven soldiers raided our camp
while I was out huntin'.

14:55.666 --> 14:57.375
I found Gwen naked,

14:57.458 --> 15:02.000
gutted like a boar
by those Xin'trean bastards.

15:02.083 --> 15:02.916
Sorry.

15:04.041 --> 15:05.875
You make for a terrible elf, you do.

15:05.958 --> 15:08.625
Apologizing to a dwarf. It's not like you.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.166
Anyway…

15:15.250 --> 15:19.250
So I went up in the Koreth Mountains
and mined myself some fine ore,

15:19.333 --> 15:23.375
smelted it down,
and added my sweet Gwen's ashes to it.

15:25.583 --> 15:29.000
And then me and Gwen went huntin'.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.458
The last thing they saw

15:37.833 --> 15:40.375
was Gwen's name coming to claim justice.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.000
Remind me never to cross her.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.750
-You and the mage lass…
-Yeah?

15:53.208 --> 15:54.583
How'd you come to be, then?

15:55.083 --> 15:57.375
Well, it's a long story.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.333
Hmm!

15:58.833 --> 16:01.000
Only stories worth telling.

16:02.166 --> 16:05.625
Well, one day
you fall into a mage's mists…

16:09.750 --> 16:12.500
and she sees all that you have done…

16:15.541 --> 16:18.166
all the evil
that you've torn into the world.

16:21.875 --> 16:24.500
And somehow, somehow, she sees…

16:29.666 --> 16:30.916
good in you.

16:34.750 --> 16:38.833
And she starts to heal your soul
with a gentleness that you don't deserve.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.708
Huh?

16:50.500 --> 16:52.541
Oh, that was a great tale, that.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.916
Oh gods, please.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.125
Stop it, you're butchering it.

18:49.208 --> 18:52.000
-Oh!

18:52.083 --> 18:56.000
-Oh!

18:56.083 --> 18:58.125
-Is that what I sound like?

18:59.333 --> 19:00.250
Thanks.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.125
You have a true gift, you know.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.708
Have you given any thought
to what you'll do

19:13.583 --> 19:15.291
if you survive all of this?

19:20.333 --> 19:21.625
I don't know.

19:24.333 --> 19:25.875
I don't have any gifts.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.958
Other than killing and…

19:32.083 --> 19:33.666
disgracing myself constantly.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.083
Who knows?

19:39.833 --> 19:41.833
If we'd been born under different stars,

19:41.916 --> 19:46.125
I'd have been raised a normal child
and… not been…

19:48.666 --> 19:49.666
uh, like this.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.500
And you'd have been a pig herder.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.125
-And Merwyn your wife.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.791
Twenty brats around you.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
No.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.500
What I had with Merwyn

20:15.291 --> 20:16.291
wasn't real.

20:22.875 --> 20:24.208
Under any star.

20:32.708 --> 20:35.208
I wish we'd been born under the same star.

20:40.041 --> 20:41.041
Yeah.

20:46.708 --> 20:47.833
Don't forget me.

21:34.875 --> 21:35.708
No.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.541
-No!
-He's beyond strong.

21:40.625 --> 21:43.208
You have to stop this.
It was supposed to be me!

21:43.291 --> 21:46.916
He's taken the first elixir.
If we stop this now, he will die.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.125
-Tie him down!

21:50.208 --> 21:52.208
-Fjall! I'm here.

21:52.791 --> 21:55.333
-It's me! I'm here.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.000
Fuck.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.916
There has to be a way to reverse this.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.375
There isn't, I--

22:05.041 --> 22:06.041
Please!

22:07.791 --> 22:09.125
We have to keep going.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.958
-No, no, no!
-Hold him still.

22:17.625 --> 22:18.625
Swallow!

22:18.708 --> 22:20.625
-Swallow!
-No!

22:31.625 --> 22:33.416
<i>As this Trial of the Grasses</i>

22:33.500 --> 22:36.125
<i>began to take its brutal toll on Fjall,</i>

22:36.208 --> 22:39.000
<i>the young empress was</i>
<i>about to realize her grand ambition.</i>

22:39.083 --> 22:39.958
Empress.

22:40.041 --> 22:42.791
<i>Taking control of the key to other worlds.</i>

22:42.875 --> 22:43.708
High Commander.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.875
Master Avallac'h. Are you ready?

22:46.958 --> 22:48.041
Of course.

22:48.958 --> 22:49.791
A moment?

23:12.458 --> 23:13.541
This is folly.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.833
We need Balor.

23:16.416 --> 23:19.041
If we can't open the gateways,
we can't conquer new worlds.

23:19.125 --> 23:20.833
Without new worlds, there is no food.

23:20.916 --> 23:24.125
-We'll have rebellion ready to ignite.
-We just got rid of him.

23:24.208 --> 23:27.416
He'll resist us now,
but I'll convince him.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.541
No. No, he'll take any punishment.

23:30.625 --> 23:33.708
He'd choose death over losing face.
I'll take care of it.

23:34.708 --> 23:36.291
Ready your scouting party.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.500
They'll be ready.

23:46.875 --> 23:48.291
How much longer?

23:48.375 --> 23:52.333
Everything so far
has been to prepare him for the procedure.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.166
This wasn't the procedure?

23:56.750 --> 23:57.833
You should go.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.708
This could all go very wrong.

24:00.791 --> 24:04.458
Éile, I know what it's like
to watch someone turn into a monster.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.708
Do what you have to do.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.291
I'm not going anywhere.

24:13.750 --> 24:14.916
Open his mouth.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.541
No! No!

24:18.625 --> 24:21.375
No, no, no.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.416
He's ready.

24:46.666 --> 24:47.791
Fjall.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.458
We have to start it now
or he won't make it.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Do it.

25:04.083 --> 25:07.875
-Mother of clay, hear my plea.

25:09.166 --> 25:12.000
Mother of seas, lend me your power.

25:12.083 --> 25:15.541
-Mother of stars, lend me your power.

25:15.625 --> 25:18.625
Mother of all unseen, lend me your power.

25:19.458 --> 25:22.333
Mother of seas, lend me your power.

25:22.416 --> 25:25.541
Mother of stars, lend me your power.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.750
Mother of clay, hear my plea.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.791
-Lend me your power!

25:33.916 --> 25:36.333
Mother of seas,
lend me your power.

25:36.416 --> 25:39.583
Mother of stars, lend me your power.

26:31.458 --> 26:32.375
He's…

26:34.541 --> 26:35.500
gone.

26:38.833 --> 26:40.458
-I'm so sorry.

27:13.375 --> 27:14.875
It's torture.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.708
You lot aren't made
for taking this much pain.

27:18.791 --> 27:21.791
Elves can take a lot more than
a dwarf can. That's a well-known fact.

27:21.875 --> 27:24.333
Ah! Fact.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.708
Elven fact.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.958
We've been taking punishment
from the likes of you for generations.

27:32.041 --> 27:36.291
Suffering and pain
you'll never understand.

27:36.375 --> 27:39.708
Yeah, but… you know,
it was a long time ago, you know.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.333
-It-- it wasn't--
-Wasn't you?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.708
Your world is built on our bones.

27:52.541 --> 27:55.000
Know why
I call those monoliths cock towers?

27:56.791 --> 28:00.625
Because our ancients buried them
to bring fertile bounty to the land.

28:02.791 --> 28:03.916
They're sacred.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.500
And, yet again, elves defile them.

28:09.625 --> 28:12.125
-No wonder famine's rife.

28:13.541 --> 28:17.000
Look, you know,
you won't find me denyin' it.

28:20.291 --> 28:22.625
You really believe
you can kill the empress?

28:24.541 --> 28:25.875
Aye, that's the plan.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.291
I'm comin' too, then.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.625
Now, why would you want to help
a gang of elves?

28:36.708 --> 28:39.625
Between yourself and myself
and the skies above…

28:43.000 --> 28:44.458
because I'm empty?

28:48.708 --> 28:53.000
I've hunted down and killed
the last of the ones who defiled Gwen.

28:55.541 --> 28:57.208
There's nothin' left for me now.

28:58.291 --> 29:00.958
One last quest to take me to her.

29:02.250 --> 29:05.833
End my breaths in a glorious fashion.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.333
We'd be glad to have you.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.458
And Gwen.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.791
We need a good cook.

29:22.833 --> 29:23.833
Where's Scían?

29:49.625 --> 29:51.000
Halt!

29:51.833 --> 29:53.833
What is your business in Xin'trea?

29:57.041 --> 29:59.208
I have information for your empress.

30:02.875 --> 30:03.750
Forward!

30:32.333 --> 30:33.750
Your markings.

30:34.250 --> 30:38.791
Ghost Tribe? I've seen drawings
in the tomes of Tolomast the Younger.

30:39.375 --> 30:40.250
I thought you were--

30:40.333 --> 30:43.750
I am the last of us,
thanks to your father.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.375
Were it another time,

30:46.458 --> 30:48.333
I would have killed you by now.

30:48.416 --> 30:49.291
Wait.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.666
Were it another time,
you would have tried.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.000
Now, what of your claim?

31:03.291 --> 31:05.708
I know where Fjall Stoneheart is.

31:06.291 --> 31:07.500
He's alive?

31:07.583 --> 31:09.625
Last I left him, yes.

31:10.166 --> 31:13.208
I traveled south with him
and the Raven girl.

31:13.291 --> 31:16.416
I was her sword mother. She trusts me.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.458
And now you're willing to betray her?

31:18.541 --> 31:21.583
You betrayed some family of your own,
I believe.

31:22.541 --> 31:26.666
50,000 oirs for Fjall, in advance,
and 20,000 for the Lark.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.041
She's not worth that much.

31:29.125 --> 31:32.666
She is the voice of the people.

31:33.916 --> 31:37.000
Besides, she has stolen his heart.

31:38.833 --> 31:40.291
-Fine.
-I'm not done.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.333
In exchange for Fjall,

31:43.458 --> 31:46.875
you will return my tribe's sacred blade,

31:48.083 --> 31:49.333
Soulreaver.

31:50.625 --> 31:54.791
Finally, I require 50
of your Golden Empire soldiers

31:54.875 --> 31:56.833
to help bring him in alive.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.666
I doubt he'll be keen to see you again,

31:59.750 --> 32:01.416
on your terms.

32:02.916 --> 32:04.375
-Make it so.
-Empress.

32:11.583 --> 32:12.625
Fjall?

32:19.166 --> 32:20.083
Fjall, it's me.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.333
I can… smell your blood.

32:31.541 --> 32:34.041
I want to destroy everything.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.125
It's all right.

32:43.416 --> 32:47.291
Hey. The others are outside.
It's just you and me.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.416
I'm sorry.

33:15.916 --> 33:17.833
What the fuck were you thinking?

33:24.208 --> 33:25.666
I thought you were gone.

33:29.416 --> 33:30.583
Couldn't bear it.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.166
I'd die for you, Éile.

35:07.250 --> 35:09.000
-You already did.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.166
We sacrificed those children
for nothing.

35:21.250 --> 35:24.625
Why didn't it work?

35:24.708 --> 35:28.125
What more could she possibly need?

35:30.416 --> 35:32.500
True sacrifice comes from within.

35:35.416 --> 35:37.083
Now I realize what she meant.

35:39.708 --> 35:40.708
Too late.

35:56.041 --> 35:57.250
We need to talk.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.625
There's no need for this.

36:05.416 --> 36:10.083
I had this dimeritium cell built
to hold recalcitrant mages.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.500
To suppress their magic.

36:13.375 --> 36:15.875
Make them feel like
they were naked and powerless.

36:18.250 --> 36:19.583
And now here I sit.

36:20.583 --> 36:22.375
Naked without my power.

36:23.625 --> 36:26.375
By the grace of a recalcitrant empress.

36:29.083 --> 36:30.875
But there is a way to be free.

36:32.083 --> 36:34.250
Serve your empress.

36:35.625 --> 36:38.375
Your little shadow
couldn't open the gateway, could he?

36:41.500 --> 36:42.666
No.

36:42.750 --> 36:43.833
Hmm.

36:44.791 --> 36:46.333
Let me speak plainly.

36:47.666 --> 36:50.000
If you cooperate under my rule,

36:50.083 --> 36:51.541
I'll absolve you of your actions

36:51.625 --> 36:54.000
and reinstate your title,
Chief Sage of the Council.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.458
I helped you once.

36:56.958 --> 36:58.250
Look where it got me.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.125
No, we began this at odds.

37:02.458 --> 37:05.333
But look at what
we have already achieved together.

37:06.458 --> 37:10.416
Elfkind under one flag at last,
poised to conquer other worlds.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.041
Thanks to me and my vision.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.666
Yes, and I am grateful for it.

37:16.958 --> 37:19.250
We are both stubborn as rams.

37:21.250 --> 37:22.250
Even so,

37:23.291 --> 37:25.416
why do we find ourselves so far apart?

37:25.500 --> 37:27.750
-It's a matter of respect.
-Respect?

37:28.458 --> 37:31.666
Balor, you see me
as a princess to be kept on a leash

37:31.750 --> 37:35.416
until the time comes to trade me,
use me, or get rid of me.

37:35.500 --> 37:39.333
And you see me as a lowborn
raised far above his station.

37:40.416 --> 37:42.208
This is how you see yourself.

37:43.958 --> 37:47.666
I see you… as a singular genius

37:47.750 --> 37:50.791
capable of so much more
than the box my father put you in.

37:52.166 --> 37:54.333
I only ask that you see me the same.

37:58.166 --> 38:02.916
Let's stop this bickering
and shape the future of elfkind together.

38:04.541 --> 38:06.625
There must be something better than this.

38:08.791 --> 38:09.750
There is.

38:12.625 --> 38:13.625
Together, then.

38:14.958 --> 38:18.833
But you must release Fenrik.
I still need her as my apprentice.

38:21.208 --> 38:22.208
Of course.

38:22.708 --> 38:26.166
You can't trust this bitch.

38:28.208 --> 38:30.458
She thanks you
from the bottom of her heart.

38:37.833 --> 38:38.958
Guard!

38:43.083 --> 38:44.083
Release them.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.416
Searched the entire
cunt-forsaken forest.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.208
My best mare is gone.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.208
-I can't believe she took her.
-Who?

38:56.291 --> 38:57.250
Scían!

38:59.083 --> 39:01.666
Oh, that-- that doesn't make sense.
Why leave now?

39:02.541 --> 39:03.583
Without a word?

39:03.666 --> 39:07.583
Maybe the lass was just being practical
in the face of a suicide mission.

39:08.458 --> 39:11.625
Turns out there's no secret entrance
into the palace after all.

39:12.166 --> 39:15.666
And when Fjall told her the truth,
you should have seen her face.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.166
-She was--
-She's back. She's back.

39:24.875 --> 39:25.916
Scouted ahead.

39:26.583 --> 39:27.500
All clear.

39:27.583 --> 39:31.791
There's a hunter's track into Xin'trea
that will give us cover.

39:31.875 --> 39:32.916
Smart.

39:37.916 --> 39:39.125
You look the same.

39:40.958 --> 39:42.250
Did it not work?

39:42.333 --> 39:43.333
It did.

39:44.958 --> 39:45.958
But not on me.

39:48.750 --> 39:51.125
<i>The Fjall</i>
<i>who emerged from that cave</i>

39:51.208 --> 39:53.625
<i>was not the same</i>
<i>as the one who had entered.</i>

39:54.500 --> 39:56.875
<i>The energy that shifted</i>
<i>in the air around him</i>

39:56.958 --> 39:59.333
<i>was like nothing</i>
<i>any of them had ever felt.</i>

40:03.166 --> 40:04.333
<i>Or seen.</i>

40:12.041 --> 40:13.458
Not bad.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.083
Then let's get on with it.

40:15.833 --> 40:16.958
No time to waste.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.208
Hurry up, Meldof.

40:25.291 --> 40:28.166
Leave her piss in peace.
Nothing worse than being rushed.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.125
-Not much further now.

40:31.208 --> 40:34.708
The hunter's track to Xin'trea
is just over the next ridge.

40:35.583 --> 40:36.958
What the fuck?

40:37.041 --> 40:38.416
-Dead end.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.291
-Where the fuck did they come from?

41:06.500 --> 41:07.833
What's she doing?

41:10.041 --> 41:11.083
No.

41:15.708 --> 41:17.666
Well, shit.

41:19.875 --> 41:21.125
Form up!

41:22.208 --> 41:23.750
Don't let them get behind us.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.083
-Hold your ground!

41:29.791 --> 41:31.666
Halt! Ready your blades.

41:32.458 --> 41:35.208
Scían, what are you doing?

42:03.250 --> 42:04.125
Hmm.

42:04.208 --> 42:05.583
That was a work of art.

42:06.708 --> 42:09.000
Look at them all.
Like little bloodied hedgehogs.

42:09.083 --> 42:11.708
Never doubt my plan again, Uthrok.

42:11.791 --> 42:14.791
-Do you know him?
-They're on our side.

42:15.625 --> 42:16.708
Did we just win?

42:17.333 --> 42:18.333
Not quite.

42:25.250 --> 42:26.416
Sorry, Gwen.

42:27.666 --> 42:29.833
Gets a wee bit jealous, see.

42:43.625 --> 42:48.166
Éile of Raven Clan, meet Uthrok One Nut.

42:49.166 --> 42:50.750
It's just a nickname.

42:50.833 --> 42:53.541
They're huge.
Like two enormous, swollen pomegranates.

42:53.625 --> 42:54.666
Go on, ask her.

42:54.750 --> 42:55.666
Hey!

42:57.500 --> 43:00.250
Don't give me that look.

43:00.750 --> 43:03.833
Every blade on the Continent
is hunting you for the reward.

43:04.791 --> 43:07.333
And I took that weakness
and made it a strength,

43:07.416 --> 43:11.250
and just like that,
we have our way into the city

43:11.958 --> 43:14.041
and our sellswords.

43:19.250 --> 43:22.625
<i>Now the Seven had</i>
<i>the blades they needed behind them,</i>

43:22.708 --> 43:24.458
<i>they stood a fighting chance…</i>

43:25.541 --> 43:27.958
<i>if they could get Fjall inside</i>

43:28.041 --> 43:31.416
<i>before the beast inside him</i>
<i>took over completely.</i>

43:35.208 --> 43:38.250
Once we get inside the city,
break open the grain stores.

43:38.333 --> 43:40.958
Let the people riot,
draw the soldiers from the palace.

43:41.041 --> 43:44.500
I'll use Fjall to get inside
the throne room so he can kill the beast.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.958
Zacaré and I will
destroy the monolith.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.833
Merwyn's mine.

43:52.250 --> 43:54.166
Here we are again, Gwen.

43:54.250 --> 43:55.541
See you soon, love.

43:57.541 --> 44:01.916
If I fall first, mind askin' her
to avenge your Elven friend?

44:03.666 --> 44:04.791
She'd be delighted.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.958
This isn't gonna work.

44:20.583 --> 44:22.166
They're onto us.

44:22.250 --> 44:23.541
Hold on.

44:25.000 --> 44:25.958
Fight it.

44:26.541 --> 44:27.541
I'm trying.

44:27.625 --> 44:29.500
-Listen.

44:40.166 --> 44:41.791
Carry my voice with you.

44:43.250 --> 44:44.458
Don't let go,

44:45.416 --> 44:48.875
not until you're staring that beast
straight in the eyes.

45:00.041 --> 45:01.208
Right, then.

45:02.583 --> 45:04.666
Let's go fuck up an empire.
