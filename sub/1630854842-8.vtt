WEBVTT

00:21.875 --> 00:25.791
Luce, I can't stand it anymore.
Say something. Anything. Please.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.250
We won. We beat Winkman.

00:28.333 --> 00:31.708
We got the mirror. It's safe with Barnes.
George will be back any moment.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.750
You can relax. It's over.

00:35.791 --> 00:36.791
No, it's not.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.541
We nearly died tonight,
all because of your bloody bet,

00:40.625 --> 00:43.291
and now every relic hunter in London
is out to kill us.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.708
They could be watching us right now.
Or waiting for us inside the house.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.708
What are we doing this for?

00:50.208 --> 00:52.666
What does any of it mean
if we end up stabbed

00:52.750 --> 00:55.750
or dead at the bottom of the Thames
with nobody left to care?

00:58.875 --> 01:00.500
This doesn't feel like winning.

01:47.833 --> 01:48.666
I'm sorry.

01:50.291 --> 01:51.208
You were right.

01:51.916 --> 01:54.125
I got totally carried away on this job.

01:54.708 --> 01:57.083
I was thoughtless and reckless.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.666
I just wanted to say,

02:07.291 --> 02:08.541
don't give up on us.

02:09.416 --> 02:10.875
-Please.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.958
Or… what I really should say is…

02:20.416 --> 02:21.791
don't give up on me.

02:27.875 --> 02:29.625
To be honest, the bottom of the Thames

02:29.708 --> 02:31.708
used to be
a far more appealing place to be.

02:33.666 --> 02:35.458
And really no one would have cared.

02:37.125 --> 02:38.250
But now…

02:47.583 --> 02:49.750
Grenadier Guard or policeman?

02:53.875 --> 02:55.083
Grenadier Guard.

02:55.875 --> 02:56.708
Okay.

02:57.291 --> 03:00.041
But if George comes in
and sees you using his eggcup,

03:00.125 --> 03:02.208
I'm not responsible for the consequences.

03:07.291 --> 03:10.541
I was right about that Dulac
book, wasn't I? It's mostly nonsense.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.833
Lots of babble about forbidden knowledge
and the mysteries of creation.

03:13.916 --> 03:16.416
Didn't you see this bit
about Bickerstaff? Listen.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.916
"Yes, I killed him."

03:19.458 --> 03:23.375
"Shot him with my father's pistol,
sealed him with iron, buried him deep."

03:23.458 --> 03:25.750
"Yet I still see him when I close my eyes,

03:25.833 --> 03:29.333
swathed in his velvet cloak,
performing his rituals."

03:29.416 --> 03:33.708
-Mary Dulac killed Bickerstaff? Why?
-"I shall claim an act of self-defense."

03:33.791 --> 03:37.000
"His cunning servant trapped me."
"The doctor held the glass before me."

03:37.083 --> 03:40.208
"One glimpse
and I felt my sanity shake loose."

03:40.291 --> 03:43.166
So she shot him
before he could kill her with the mirror?

03:43.666 --> 03:45.875
-Fair enough.
-No, wait.

03:47.291 --> 03:50.291
"For this looking glass
was not a mirror after all."

03:52.208 --> 03:53.416
"It was a window."

03:54.000 --> 03:55.083
A window to where?

03:55.916 --> 03:58.833
"I dare not say any more,
and I have no one left to confide in."

03:58.916 --> 04:02.083
"Since that glimpse, I am damned."
"All I want to see is more."

04:03.041 --> 04:05.083
Lockwood, look.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.500
Look at the illustration.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.791
Look at the mirror.

04:24.541 --> 04:25.708
Where the hell is George?

05:40.291 --> 05:41.291
It's okay.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.125
It's okay.

05:43.791 --> 05:44.833
Stay calm.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.750
Pamela?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.083
-Pamela?

05:57.083 --> 05:58.666
I'm sorry. I startled you.

05:58.750 --> 06:02.250
-No. It's good to see you.
-I'm so glad you came.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.833
I was worried
that you'd have second thoughts.

06:05.416 --> 06:07.083
Are you sure no one followed you?

06:07.166 --> 06:08.833
We should go in. Get on with it.

06:11.875 --> 06:15.833
How did it go?
That Flo Bones girl didn't try to take it?

06:15.916 --> 06:17.333
No, it wasn't difficult.

06:17.833 --> 06:21.458
Lockwood and Lucy did the cool stuff
and left the donkey work to me, as usual.

06:21.541 --> 06:23.500
Don't do yourself down, George.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.791
Lockwood and Lucy might be highly gifted,

06:26.291 --> 06:29.500
but trust me, if anyone's
going down in history, it's you.

06:29.583 --> 06:30.541
You think so?

06:31.041 --> 06:35.083
You've done the right thing. If DEPRAC
had got their hands on the bone glass,

06:35.166 --> 06:37.125
it'd be lost forever, into the furnace,

06:37.208 --> 06:40.041
along with everything it can teach us
about the Problem.

06:40.541 --> 06:42.375
All they do is destroy things.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
They'll never learn.
But you and me, we'll learn.

06:47.958 --> 06:49.375
We'll learn everything.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.875
You don't mind, do you?

06:54.208 --> 06:58.666
-Long as you don't run off with it.
-I wouldn't dream of it. I need you.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.333
Come on. I want to show you
what I've been doing.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.208
Oof!

07:13.291 --> 07:15.875
What do you know?
What have you seen? Where's he taken it?

07:16.500 --> 07:20.958
Too busy playing the happy couple, weren't
you? No wonder he found another friend.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.291
-Lucy, tell me what he's saying now.
-Something about another friend.

07:24.375 --> 07:28.208
What other friend? Flo? George doesn't
have any other friends apart from--

07:28.291 --> 07:29.208
Joplin.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.958
Sh… she wouldn't do anything. Would she?

07:33.041 --> 07:34.708
Death is coming,

07:35.750 --> 07:38.375
and he's gone to meet it, with her.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.541
It's got Joplin too. Everyone
who goes near that thing loses their mind.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.208
Tell me where they are.

07:45.291 --> 07:48.000
I'll tell you, if you take me.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.416
-Where?
-To see my master.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.916
-Bickerstaff.
-They're at the cemetery.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
With the dead.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.875
About to join them.

07:56.958 --> 07:59.250
And it's all your fault.

08:03.958 --> 08:06.833
It's all empty.
George must have forgotten to restock.

08:06.916 --> 08:10.041
No. This is my fault. I should've noticed
what was happening to him.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.583
No. It all started going wrong
when I joined.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.541
I screwed everything up between you.

08:15.791 --> 08:18.166
One measly box of salt-bombs.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.291
This is a nightmare. We're dead.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.000
Maybe. But if anything's worth dying for…

08:26.375 --> 08:29.625
If any agent's gonna beat
this bone glass, Bickerstaff,

08:29.708 --> 08:32.458
whatever grip they've got on George,
it's you.

08:33.375 --> 08:36.791
-Thanks. Put it all on me, why don't you?
-That's not what I mean.

08:36.875 --> 08:40.208
What I mean is that we're gonna do this.
Both of us.

08:41.083 --> 08:43.416
-For George.
-For George.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.958
She was in front of us
this whole time.

09:03.041 --> 09:06.333
Poking her nose in before we'd even
opened Bickerstaff's bloody coffin.

09:06.416 --> 09:09.541
She must've hired Carver to steal
the bone glass and put a knife in his back

09:09.625 --> 09:11.625
when he double-crossed her
and took it to Winkman.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.750
I can't believe she's capable of this.

09:13.833 --> 09:17.666
Pretending like she cared. Wanting to be
part of the team. Everything was an act.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.833
God knows what she's been
whispering in George's ear.

09:19.916 --> 09:22.125
We knew how much
it had gotten under his skin.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.916
His little comments,
how distracted he was.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.208
We noticed it,
but we didn't take any notice.

09:26.291 --> 09:29.375
-Too wrapped up in our own bullshit.
-I have said how sorry I am--

09:29.458 --> 09:31.666
It doesn't matter
how sorry either of us are.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.625
Being sorry is not gonna save him.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.000
You really think it's got to him?

09:40.333 --> 09:42.375
I don't think it's taken control of him.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.500
George wouldn't do something like this.
This is someone else's work.

09:46.291 --> 09:47.916
Something else's.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.333
This place is crawling
with dead things.

09:52.416 --> 09:56.458
Don't go so fast. I need to kill these
lights in case anyone tries to follow us.

09:56.541 --> 10:00.291
No one's going to follow us.
They'd be mad. Here, take my hand.

10:01.750 --> 10:04.291
Don't worry.
It's nothing I can't deal with.

10:06.875 --> 10:11.291
-Your flat would've been nicer, though.
-Oh no. It had to be here.

10:11.916 --> 10:14.125
Because of something
in Bickerstaff's papers?

10:14.208 --> 10:15.708
The way to look at it safely?

10:15.791 --> 10:16.625
Exactly.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.791
-What was that?
-I don't know.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.666
Wait here. Don't move.

10:28.458 --> 10:29.583
I'll be right back.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.291
Be quick.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.833
<i>-Whoo!</i>
-Oh!

11:03.958 --> 11:05.333
<i>-Whoo!</i>
-Aaah!

11:06.500 --> 11:08.250
<i>Aah! </i>

11:32.833 --> 11:34.833
What the hell are you doing here, Kipps?

11:35.875 --> 11:37.708
I could ask you the same thing.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.625
-You've got the mirror.
-Don't mess with me.

11:40.708 --> 11:44.125
-I just saved your life.
-Bullshit. I had it under control.

11:44.208 --> 11:47.583
No, you didn't. You couldn't see it.
You were all over the place.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.750
You're losing your talent.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.458
You dare tell anyone

11:59.208 --> 12:01.041
and I'll kill you, you hear me?

12:01.125 --> 12:03.916
Calm down, Mr. Kipps,
and let go of my friend.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.125
Put your hands behind your back.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.875
Now turn around slowly.

12:18.666 --> 12:20.083
What are you-- What the--

12:20.166 --> 12:23.791
You could be arrested for this.
Both of you. You're criminals.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.375
George, you'll be destroyed.
You'll never work again.

12:26.458 --> 12:27.708
Why did you bring that?

12:28.208 --> 12:31.333
And handcuffs and a knife?

12:31.958 --> 12:34.625
Because I knew
that something like this might happen.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.583
Everyone in London wants what we have.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.708
But it's ours.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.708
We can't let anyone jeopardize that.

12:45.291 --> 12:47.041
Come on, then, you big bastard.

12:47.125 --> 12:50.000
-Tell us where he is.
-Is that aimed at me or the skull?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.250
The skull.
I'd never be that polite to you.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.416
-Can't you use a different voice?
-No.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.458
Stop glowing so much. You'll give us away.

12:57.541 --> 12:59.166
-That was to the skull.
-I got that.

12:59.250 --> 13:03.208
How can I, when my master's
so close? I can feel him.

13:03.291 --> 13:06.000
They'd better be here.
If you're just using us--

13:06.083 --> 13:08.166
Oh, don't worry. They will be.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.625
He's her master now.
She's lost to your world.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.000
All it takes is one glance.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.916
-And everyone wants to look.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.416
-I don't.
-You couldn't resist.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.458
Nor could he. Who knows what he might see?

13:21.541 --> 13:23.916
-Mummy and Daddy, maybe?
-What's he saying now?

13:24.416 --> 13:27.833
Neither of us could resist looking
in the bone glass if we had the chance.

13:31.833 --> 13:34.541
Just promise me
you won't, though, Lockwood.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.375
I need you to be
just the right amount of reckless.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.875
Of course.
But why are you so worried about me?

13:39.958 --> 13:41.625
-What about you?
-Won't be a problem.

13:42.500 --> 13:46.083
Can't stand mirrors. There's always
this stupid girl staring back at me.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.791
Let's draw our swords
and kick in the doors.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.291
Like we're cool
and really know what we're doing.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.000
Okay.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.166
Hear anything?

14:05.250 --> 14:06.416
Not a sound.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.875
It's warm. Not hot. Someone's
been here tonight, but not for a while.

14:11.958 --> 14:12.958
Oh, and look.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.333
Bickerstaff's coffin.

14:15.416 --> 14:18.333
I can't sense anything.
There's nothing in there.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.833
-Why would she take his body?
-For a mad experiment.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.125
She wants the master
to witness whatever they're doing.

14:25.625 --> 14:26.458
This is good.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.750
They can't have gone far with a body.
They must still be here somewhere.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.791
-It's locked.
-Oh God.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.250
-From the inside.
-Where does it go?

14:38.333 --> 14:42.500
Before, George said there were catacombs,
so there has to be another way down.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.708
The catafalque. Saunders said
it was still working, didn't he?

14:45.791 --> 14:48.416
Look everywhere.
There has to be a way to operate it.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.333
Lockwood!

14:54.541 --> 14:56.750
-Where's Kipps?
-Why are you here?

14:56.833 --> 14:59.958
-What do you mean, "Where's Kipps"?
-He followed Karim here. Called us.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.000
Our agents have been
following you for days.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.458
We know Karim's got the mirror
and they're both here.

15:04.541 --> 15:06.250
They're both in serious trouble.

15:06.833 --> 15:09.166
We need each other's help,
so put those swords down

15:09.250 --> 15:10.541
and let's get on with it.

15:14.291 --> 15:17.875
We think they're in the catacombs.
But that platform's the only way down.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.375
-It's called a catafalque.
-We know.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.000
Do you know how they're operated, Bobby?
From above or below?

15:26.375 --> 15:27.208
Above.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.916
The minister lowers the coffin
during the service. There's a button.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.833
Kat! There's people here.

15:37.416 --> 15:40.083
Four nasty-looking bastards in a van.
Said Winkman's on the side.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.541
-Oh shit.
-How did they find us?

15:41.625 --> 15:43.833
Probably followed the parade
of bloody Fittes agents.

15:43.916 --> 15:45.583
-Friends?
-We know Winkman.

15:45.666 --> 15:48.083
-We know he's a psychopath.
-Anthony Lockwood!

15:48.166 --> 15:49.458
-What are we gonna do?
-Run.

15:49.541 --> 15:51.333
-Not an option.
-Barricade ourselves inside.

15:51.416 --> 15:53.916
-No, they'd have the advantage.
-What's your plan?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.875
I barricade myself inside, rescue George
and Kipps. You fight them off out here.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.083
Fight them off?

15:59.166 --> 16:02.166
If you'd rather go down
to the catacombs alone, go for it.

16:02.750 --> 16:05.000
-I'd rather deal with that lot.
-Where you going?

16:05.083 --> 16:06.583
-Anthony!
-No. I'll go.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.916
-No way, Luce.
-It has to be me.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.166
-I've got a secret weapon.
-It's too dangerous.

16:11.750 --> 16:15.291
You have to let me do this, Lockwood.
For George.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.708
And remember, just reckless enough.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.083
-Okay?
-With me!

16:30.833 --> 16:32.208
What's the secret weapon?

16:33.208 --> 16:34.041
She is.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.958
Where's my mirror?

16:44.875 --> 16:47.833
What are they doing?
Don't they know this place is infested?

16:47.916 --> 16:49.500
Oh, they're going to put us in there.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.125
We should've run.
You're gonna get us killed.

16:54.208 --> 16:57.916
Pull yourselves together. You're elite
Fittes agents, three of the best I've met.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.833
And I'm Anthony bloody Lockwood.

16:59.916 --> 17:02.708
Any one of us could see this lot off
any day of the week.

17:02.791 --> 17:05.000
But all of us together?
This will be a walk in the park.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.541
-You're dead!
-This isn't a park, it's a graveyard.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.333
-Then let's bury them.
-Dead!

17:09.916 --> 17:11.416
-You're dead, Lockwood.
-Yeah!

18:32.833 --> 18:34.916
We have to get them away from the chapel.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.208
-How?
-Run!

18:39.750 --> 18:40.625
Hey!

19:06.083 --> 19:09.041
-Oh yes! That sound!

19:10.125 --> 19:13.500
Bone glass. Such sweet ecstasy.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.750
It doesn't sound like ecstasy to me.

19:15.833 --> 19:19.041
-Your petty mind can't comprehend.
-Then help me comprehend.

19:21.791 --> 19:23.625
Were you there when it was made?

19:24.125 --> 19:25.041
Of course.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.541
From the bones of seven bodies,
suffering souls.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.500
The power of their torment trapped--

19:30.583 --> 19:34.416
Trapped in glass to make a window.
A window to see what?

19:34.500 --> 19:35.875
The eternal.

19:35.958 --> 19:38.833
What does that mean?
What did you actually see when you looked?

19:38.916 --> 19:41.125
I never looked. I'm not a fool.

19:42.083 --> 19:45.416
The way to look
is with someone else's eyes.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.208
Someone weak. Someone curious.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.291
Someone vulnerable.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.750
-Oh God.

19:54.083 --> 19:54.916
George.

19:56.208 --> 19:59.833
Don't worry. We won't hurt you.
We're doing this for your own protection.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.083
Do you really believe that?

20:03.083 --> 20:05.375
Wake up, Karim. She's gonna kill us both.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.500
We have to get out of here
while we still can.

20:07.583 --> 20:10.291
No one's going to kill anyone.
We're academics.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.125
This is a scientific experiment.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.958
None of this would be necessary
if you'd minded your own business.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.875
You've lost your mind.
You're as mad as she is.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.666
Pamela, what's Bickerstaff's body
doing here?

20:23.750 --> 20:27.708
We could hardly do it without him,
could we? This is all because of him.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.625
He deserves a front-row seat.

20:29.708 --> 20:32.666
But don't worry,
he's quite safe behind the chains.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.416
A front-row seat to what?

20:34.500 --> 20:37.416
Tell me what you've discovered,
what the methodology is.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.208
How we're going to look at it safely.

20:39.291 --> 20:42.125
In those papers,
whenever he mentions followers,

20:42.208 --> 20:44.458
he's always talking about adults.

20:44.541 --> 20:48.000
He didn't know that it's young people
who have the ability to see beyond.

20:48.708 --> 20:52.375
He was too far ahead of his time.
Missing the vital key.

20:52.916 --> 20:54.166
So you were going to…

20:54.916 --> 20:57.666
If Kipps hadn't barged in,
it would've been me sitting there?

20:58.250 --> 21:02.625
It'll be the most wonderful thing, George.
You said you wanted to see more.

21:03.541 --> 21:06.375
But if I said no, those cuffs were for me?

21:07.708 --> 21:10.208
You're missing the point
quite spectacularly.

21:12.333 --> 21:16.958
All our lives, we've been buried in books.
We live in our minds.

21:17.625 --> 21:21.958
And here at last is something that will
tell us everything we ever wanted to know.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.833
Make us feel everything.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.000
You and me,

21:27.500 --> 21:28.916
with him as our conduit.

21:29.958 --> 21:31.666
-It's perfect.
-No.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.291
You can't use me.

21:35.791 --> 21:37.208
I can't see. I…

21:38.291 --> 21:41.166
I've lost my talent.
I've lost my talent. Tell her!

21:42.375 --> 21:43.791
Is that true, George?

21:49.833 --> 21:51.250
You were saving him from a ghost.

21:56.541 --> 22:00.333
I know that knife. I've seen one like it
before. They come in pairs.

22:03.166 --> 22:04.166
Wh--

22:07.958 --> 22:09.500
You killed Carver.

22:11.916 --> 22:13.583
-No, George.
-He betrayed you.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.625
-No, no.
-He realized what the glass was worth.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.375
Sold it to Winkman, didn't give it to you.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.416
-Listen.
-You planned this.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.291
-It's all gonna be fine.
-And I helped you.

22:21.375 --> 22:24.166
It's all going to be absolutely…

22:24.833 --> 22:25.666
perfect.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.833
No, no, no!

23:30.416 --> 23:34.083
After I kill you, I'm gonna find
that little scrubber girlfriend of yours,

23:34.166 --> 23:35.500
and I'm gonna kill her too.

23:42.291 --> 23:44.166
-Where are the others?
-Follow me.

23:46.791 --> 23:48.041
I knew you'd be okay.

23:48.125 --> 23:51.458
-We're really not okay.
-We heard voices. There's more.

23:51.541 --> 23:52.708
There. Look.

23:56.750 --> 23:57.666
Lockwood.

23:58.666 --> 23:59.666
Lockwood!

24:00.750 --> 24:02.916
-He's left us.
-Ugh! The bastard tricked us.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.666
-That bastard had a plan.
-A suicidal one.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.750
That tends to be a feature
of all my best plans.

24:12.833 --> 24:15.750
-Keep ghosts away till DEPRAC get here.
-You called DEPRAC?

24:15.833 --> 24:19.125
Not yet. But one of these huts has
to have a phone. I'll call them on my way.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.250
-On your way where?
-To save my friends.

24:22.250 --> 24:23.083
And Kipps.

24:32.666 --> 24:34.583
You were right. It's perfect.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.500
You don't care about me.
You just care about that mirror.

24:41.666 --> 24:42.791
You didn't need me.

24:44.791 --> 24:47.250
Just like Lucy and Lockwood
didn't need me.

24:50.625 --> 24:51.875
'Cause I'm the oddball.

24:52.875 --> 24:53.916
The third wheel.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.625
Dispensable.
Always have been, always will be.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.458
It makes sense this is how it ends.

25:08.833 --> 25:10.166
My master!

25:11.625 --> 25:13.541
He… is…

25:14.625 --> 25:15.708
arisen!

25:24.083 --> 25:28.125
Set him free of those chains!
His greatness should not be constrained.

25:28.625 --> 25:32.541
Let him bear full witness
to this glorious moment!

25:33.041 --> 25:34.375
Lucy! Behind you!

25:35.541 --> 25:39.333
It's the little listener.
But you didn't hear me coming, did you?

25:41.500 --> 25:44.000
I don't think
you're going to kill me, Miss Joplin.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.166
She will! She killed Jack Carver.

25:46.250 --> 25:48.416
-You shouldn't have come!
-No, I had to!

25:49.166 --> 25:50.875
Because you're not a third wheel.

25:51.666 --> 25:52.833
Or an oddball.

25:53.833 --> 25:55.958
Or whatever it is that you think you are.

25:56.791 --> 25:58.125
You're the best of us.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.333
I left my family without looking back.

26:03.166 --> 26:06.291
Lockwood's lost all of his.
We are not losing you, Georgie.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.750
Very moving. Now bind your hands.

26:11.125 --> 26:12.041
No.

26:13.083 --> 26:16.458
Because if anybody
is looking in that mirror, it's me.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.875
No! No way!

26:17.958 --> 26:19.125
It has to be me.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.125
'Cause this is something else.

26:22.625 --> 26:26.041
This is historic, and for that,
you need the best talent in the room.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.458
The best since Marissa Fittes.

26:29.583 --> 26:32.708
I can talk with Type Threes.
Commune with the other side.

26:32.791 --> 26:35.708
This is what I'm made for.
This is meant for me.

26:35.791 --> 26:39.125
-No, Lucy, I won't let you!
-George, you don't have a choice in this!

26:42.541 --> 26:44.250
He'll be dead in an instant.

26:46.958 --> 26:49.375
Just look how much
one glance has screwed him up. Just…

26:49.875 --> 26:51.791
Just… just let me do this for him.

26:53.125 --> 26:54.041
Please.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.083
Cross me…

27:01.833 --> 27:03.916
and I'll cut both your throats.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.416
God's sake. Really?

27:18.000 --> 27:18.833
Really.

27:19.375 --> 27:22.958
Look, there have been several developments
since we last met.

27:23.041 --> 27:26.208
It's far too complicated to get into,
but I'll cut a long story short.

27:26.291 --> 27:29.583
I'm working with Fittes now,
so can we call a truce?

27:29.666 --> 27:30.958
In a bit of a hurry here.

27:31.916 --> 27:33.000
I'm not Fittes.

27:33.791 --> 27:35.416
You've no idea who I am.

27:36.208 --> 27:39.916
Okay, well, I've already dealt with
eight thugs and one psychopath tonight,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.416
so one more fight's not gonna kill me.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.458
Especially with someone
I've beaten twice already.

27:45.541 --> 27:49.250
You've no idea who I am, and you've
no idea what you're messing with.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.000
The forces in play.

27:52.416 --> 27:55.500
The bone glass is… an inconvenience.

27:56.250 --> 27:58.833
You are insignificant.

28:00.208 --> 28:02.250
Just like your mother and father were.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.000
What's that supposed to mean?

28:06.708 --> 28:07.833
You'll never know.

28:21.791 --> 28:24.625
Please, Lucy, don't! It'll kill you!

28:24.708 --> 28:26.208
Don't you dare look.

28:26.291 --> 28:28.916
And whatever happens,
this wasn't your fault.

28:33.625 --> 28:34.958
This was my choice.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.166
Tell me what you see.

28:40.958 --> 28:44.000
What you feel, and what you hear.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.083
Every detail.

28:54.625 --> 28:55.708
Turn…

28:58.083 --> 28:59.833
-Look!

28:59.916 --> 29:00.791
Look!

29:01.791 --> 29:03.166
Look!

29:03.250 --> 29:05.708
Look! Damn you!

29:07.041 --> 29:08.458
Look!

29:14.083 --> 29:15.333
What? What--

29:15.916 --> 29:18.541
If you can talk to it,
tell me what it says.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.458
What is he saying?

29:23.375 --> 29:28.041
Talk! Take it all in
and tell your master what you see.

29:30.291 --> 29:33.875
No, no, no, this isn't right!
Something's changed!

29:33.958 --> 29:36.333
-They're trapped!

29:36.416 --> 29:39.416
Speak, girl. Speak!

29:39.500 --> 29:41.958
-It says something's wrong.
-More!

29:42.791 --> 29:46.166
-Don't stop.
-It's not… it's not the eternal!

29:46.250 --> 29:48.833
It's a trap. We have to destroy it!

30:02.958 --> 30:04.000
Lucy!

30:05.625 --> 30:06.708
No!

30:29.000 --> 30:30.666
Lucy! Lucy!

30:30.750 --> 30:32.291
Lucy, Lucy, it's me, it's me.

30:32.375 --> 30:33.875
Say something, speak to me!

30:41.916 --> 30:43.333
You broke it.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.958
You stupid little boy.

30:50.125 --> 30:50.958
Wait.

30:53.166 --> 30:54.791
-It's working.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.208
Something's happening.

30:59.416 --> 31:00.250
Yes.

31:02.666 --> 31:04.125
It's extraordinary.

31:04.791 --> 31:07.916
Whatever happens, don't look at her.
Don't look at it.

31:08.666 --> 31:10.291
It's wonderful!

31:16.833 --> 31:18.041
It's beautiful.

31:20.166 --> 31:24.041
Beautiful!

31:32.500 --> 31:33.500
Lucy, don't--

31:35.541 --> 31:36.500
No, it's okay.

31:37.458 --> 31:38.291
Look.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.166
Uh…

31:51.125 --> 31:52.916
Why aren't they coming for us?

31:56.750 --> 31:58.208
You've set them free.

32:14.416 --> 32:15.291
George.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.958
-How did he escape?
-His chains…

32:20.041 --> 32:22.250
-The blast blew them apart!
-Where's your rapier?

32:22.333 --> 32:23.458
God knows!

32:23.541 --> 32:25.833
He's locking us. I can't move!

32:26.750 --> 32:27.583
Me neither.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.500
I can't look away.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.125
I'm sorry about everything, Luce.

32:34.791 --> 32:35.916
So am I.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.541
Get away from them. They're my friends!

32:44.416 --> 32:46.666
Lucy, George, move now!

33:06.916 --> 33:07.833
What happened?

33:07.916 --> 33:09.208
Fought off a load of thugs,

33:09.291 --> 33:11.916
fell down the catafalque hole,
battled a bunch of ghosts.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.708
You know, usual sort of thing.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.250
Oh, and I got shot.

33:17.916 --> 33:19.000
We need an ambulance.

33:19.083 --> 33:21.750
You need to destroy Joplin's tape,
make Kipps keep quiet,

33:21.833 --> 33:24.000
or you'll be even more done than I am.

33:24.083 --> 33:25.458
Ah!

33:25.541 --> 33:27.666
You're not done. Don't say that.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.541
This isn't how you die.

33:29.625 --> 33:30.583
How do you know?

33:31.083 --> 33:33.666
Because we won't let you.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.916
-Will we, George?
-Never.

34:07.666 --> 34:09.041
I don't know what happened.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.000
But I know it was you.

34:12.708 --> 34:14.250
Your talent, it saved us.

34:15.625 --> 34:16.750
We all did our bit.

34:19.208 --> 34:20.250
Except for me.

34:23.625 --> 34:26.083
You don't know what it's like
when your talent starts to fade.

34:28.166 --> 34:29.166
You sense them.

34:30.541 --> 34:33.916
You know they're there,
but… can't do anything about it.

34:35.666 --> 34:36.791
All that's left is…

34:38.458 --> 34:39.291
terror.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.375
It'll happen to you one day.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.375
Everything that makes you special…

34:50.958 --> 34:51.791
gone.

34:52.875 --> 34:56.000
-I didn't know.
-I thought George would've told you.

34:57.708 --> 34:58.541
No.

34:59.166 --> 35:00.791
No, we won't tell anyone.

35:02.041 --> 35:03.041
I promise.

35:07.541 --> 35:08.750
You can see him now.

35:11.916 --> 35:13.541
-Go on, George. Go.
-See ya.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.750
Just reckless enough.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.083
Miss Carlyle, Mr. Karim,
hoping you can help me.

35:25.625 --> 35:29.458
They found the bullet. But there's no sign
of a firearm on the scene.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.875
Either of you see anyone with a gun?

35:33.333 --> 35:34.250
Mr. Kipps?

35:35.916 --> 35:38.958
-Surely Lockwood knows who shot him.
-It was dark.

35:39.541 --> 35:41.291
Couldn't see a thing. Sorry.

35:42.375 --> 35:45.208
-There's nothing you're not telling us?
-Nothing at all.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.750
Anything else we can help you with,
Inspector Barnes?

35:49.833 --> 35:52.958
You've done enough.
The bone glass will go to the furnaces.

35:53.041 --> 35:56.625
Winkman's off to prison.
All in all, I'm a happy man.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.833
-You don't look it.
-Trust me.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.916
This is happy.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.458
Enjoy it while it lasts.

36:03.041 --> 36:05.541
Oh, and, uh… congratulations.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.500
You did it.

36:12.875 --> 36:14.125
He awarded you the case.

36:14.625 --> 36:15.458
Oh.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.916
The bet.

36:17.625 --> 36:19.791
I'll write the advert
and hand in my notice.

36:21.250 --> 36:22.208
I keep my word.

36:23.708 --> 36:24.958
That's all I needed to hear.

36:25.541 --> 36:29.083
Let's forget about the whole thing.
It was a stupid idea in the first place.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.791
-Seriously?
-We did it together.

36:32.666 --> 36:33.625
Side by side.

36:34.333 --> 36:37.250
-I told Barnes to split the commission.
-Fifty-fifty?

36:38.250 --> 36:39.125
Seventy-thirty.

36:39.708 --> 36:43.041
We're an independent organization.
We've got overheads.

36:48.458 --> 36:49.875
You're all right, Lockwood.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.000
Thirty percent all right.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.333
Had to outplay him
on every level, didn't you?

37:01.416 --> 37:02.541
That's not it.

37:03.041 --> 37:06.833
It was just… the right thing to do,
wasn't it?

37:09.500 --> 37:13.375
Now, who is gonna help me
get out of here?

37:18.416 --> 37:20.625
Ugh. This is so touchy-feely.

37:20.708 --> 37:23.708
It's a medical necessity,
George. It doesn't mean a thing.

37:24.458 --> 37:27.583
So, Luce,
you feeling like we've won yet?

37:28.250 --> 37:31.250
Get me home with a cup of tea
and… maybe.

37:40.791 --> 37:42.500
DEPRAC has the bone glass.

37:43.166 --> 37:45.875
It's been damaged.
Can't be sure how badly.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.166
It's on its way to the furnaces.

37:49.208 --> 37:51.541
I'm sorry. I thought I'd killed him.

37:52.625 --> 37:56.458
Just as long as it's out of their hands.
Out of the public domain.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.250
But we should take extra precautions.

38:00.208 --> 38:01.458
Drive on.

38:11.458 --> 38:16.666
It's all super dark, top-secret shit,
so I can't give you any details yet.

38:22.875 --> 38:23.875
Honestly, Norrie,

38:24.916 --> 38:26.458
you'd hardly recognize me.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.041
I've been through so much.

38:30.708 --> 38:31.875
But…

38:31.958 --> 38:34.500
…I think I'm starting to heal now.

38:39.541 --> 38:41.000
I hope you are too.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.083
George, it smells really good.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.500
-Thanks.
-Got the glasses?

38:47.583 --> 38:49.875
-This is my secret recipe.
-I'll take the plates over.

38:49.958 --> 38:50.791
After you.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.333
Coming through, coming through.

38:53.416 --> 38:54.791
<i>I was wrong about George.</i>

38:54.875 --> 38:58.666
<i>He didn't hate my guts. He actually</i>
<i>turned out to be a bit of a hero.</i>

38:58.750 --> 39:00.083
<i>Which is good.</i>

39:00.166 --> 39:01.958
-Cream.
-Of course.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.166
<i>Lockwood almost died</i>
<i>a thousand times, but…</i>

39:05.250 --> 39:06.125
Ooh, wait!

39:06.208 --> 39:08.541
<i>…I think he's decided</i>
<i>he's better off alive.</i>

39:09.041 --> 39:11.166
<i>-Which is really good.</i>
I made sandwiches too.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.750
<i>-And Lucy Carlyle?</i>
-Mmm!

39:12.833 --> 39:15.041
<i>-She's doing all right.</i>
Could I have one?

39:15.125 --> 39:16.666
<i>-She feels stronger.</i>
Thank you.

39:16.750 --> 39:21.000
<i>Less scared of her talent.</i>
<i>Less scared of… everything.</i>

39:24.208 --> 39:25.833
Has it still not said anything?

39:26.791 --> 39:28.583
What do you think
it actually saw?

39:28.666 --> 39:31.833
All that "trapped" stuff.
Was it talking about the seven spirits?

39:33.666 --> 39:35.333
I'd rather not think about it.

39:38.166 --> 39:39.750
We'll destroy it.

39:40.541 --> 39:41.791
If you want us to.

39:42.791 --> 39:45.916
-No. Let's keep it.
-Good.

39:46.625 --> 39:48.333
'Cause it's incredibly rare.

39:49.083 --> 39:50.250
Both of you are.

39:51.916 --> 39:53.375
As long as no one finds out.

39:53.875 --> 39:55.833
-About either of us.
-They won't.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.666
I promise.

40:02.791 --> 40:03.916
I've been thinking.

40:05.208 --> 40:07.416
We shouldn't have
any more secrets between us.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.000
So…

40:10.875 --> 40:12.500
I did see who shot me.

40:14.125 --> 40:15.250
It was the Golden Blade.

40:15.333 --> 40:17.708
-That prick from Fittes?
-He's not from Fittes.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.583
-He's part of something else.
-What do you mean?

40:21.083 --> 40:23.916
Before he shot me,
he mentioned my parents.

40:25.041 --> 40:27.708
Said their deaths were insignificant.

40:28.375 --> 40:29.666
Like mine would be.

40:30.916 --> 40:32.708
Holy shit, Lockwood.

40:32.791 --> 40:33.875
What does he know?

40:34.625 --> 40:36.833
-We have to find out--
-Yes, we absolutely have to.

40:36.916 --> 40:39.583
And we will.
We'll figure out what's really going on.

40:41.041 --> 40:45.458
But not till my legs work properly
and it doesn't hurt every time I laugh.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.458
There's nothing to stop me
doing some background--

40:54.375 --> 40:58.250
Talking of my family,
there's something else you should know.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.041
About that locked room upstairs.

41:02.750 --> 41:03.666
Really?

41:04.541 --> 41:05.541
You're not gonna…

41:06.500 --> 41:07.750
No more secrets.

41:18.541 --> 41:22.458
Lockwood, you really don't have to.
Not if you don't want to.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.166
I want to.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.166
Ready?
