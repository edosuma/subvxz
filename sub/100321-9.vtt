just call me Artie.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.828
- Oh. [Chuckles]

08:44.872 --> 08:48.310
Well, please don't call me
"Dad."

08:48.353 --> 08:50.355
[All chuckle]

08:50.399 --> 08:51.835
- [Sighs]

08:52.880 --> 08:55.273
- Could I get a coffee,
Twyla, please?

08:55.317 --> 08:58.276
[Artie and Alexis chatter
and giggle]

08:58.320 --> 09:01.018
- So I see Alexis is getting
back out there.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.934
- Has she told you anything
about this guy?

09:03.978 --> 09:06.676
- No, but I think he dated
my aunt.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.548
I don't know,
I was a baby at the time,

09:08.591 --> 09:11.028
but there's a photo of him
holding me at Christmas.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.508
And I remember that,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.379
because that was the year
Santa brought me a lighter.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.818
- Okay, I'll be right back.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.298
Stay right there.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.693
- Excuse me, Twyla.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.434
Arthur, hi,

09:25.477 --> 09:27.392
do you mind if I uh,
join you for a minute?

09:27.436 --> 09:29.090
- No, of course.

09:29.133 --> 09:32.963
Always room at the table
for Lexi's... old man.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.878
- That's a smidge worse
than "Dad."

09:34.922 --> 09:36.750
[Both laugh]

09:36.793 --> 09:38.708
Uh, what do you do
for a living?

09:38.752 --> 09:40.405
- Well, actually,

09:40.449 --> 09:42.190
I am retired.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.627
Yeah, but I used to own um,

09:44.671 --> 09:46.368
a chain of trailer parks.

09:46.411 --> 09:49.066
But don't-don't worry, I don't
you know, live in a trailer.

09:49.110 --> 09:52.679
I own a beautiful
three-bedroom home

09:52.722 --> 09:54.419
with an above ground pool,

09:54.463 --> 09:55.986
if that's what
you're worried about.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.380
- No, that wasn't my primary
concern, Arthur.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.773
- Oh.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.426
- No, the thing is,
as a parent,

10:01.470 --> 10:04.604
I can't help but notice there's
a bit of an age discrepancy.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.868
- Oh! No, no, we're totally
chill with that.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.826
I mean, Lexi's a great girl.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.436
- Yes, she is.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.742
Yes, she is.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.744
But um, Arthur,

10:14.788 --> 10:17.268
my daughter is in a bit of a...

10:17.312 --> 10:19.923
vulnerable space right now.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.273
She just got out of a rather
serious relationship,

10:22.317 --> 10:24.667
a week ago,

10:24.711 --> 10:27.322
and she was engaged
to him twice.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.543
I'm not entirely sure
what she's doing,

10:31.587 --> 10:33.633
but uh, you might wanna...

10:33.676 --> 10:35.591
tread lightly.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.724
- Oh... understood.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.772
Yeah. Thanks for the heads up.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.905
- Okay.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.646
- Uh, Johnny, I...

10:46.689 --> 10:49.736
I know it isn't always easy
being a dad.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.520
And being a grandad's
even harder.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.784
- Oh, well, maybe you might
wanna give me some tips

10:54.828 --> 10:56.699
when I eventually get there.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.962
[Both chuckle]

11:02.749 --> 11:05.708
Roland: Alright, now you tell
me how we're gonna fix this.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.667
- Hello, council people!

11:07.710 --> 11:09.538
Why, you ask, are we here,

11:09.581 --> 11:11.409
trembling before you?

11:13.020 --> 11:14.848
Well, I'll answer
your question.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.806
I was assailed this morning.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.808
- Is that a fact?
- Stone cold.

11:18.852 --> 11:21.419
Stevie was there. Stevie,
describe the carnage.

11:21.463 --> 11:24.248
- Um, well, there were a couple
of broken eggs

11:24.292 --> 11:25.815
on Mrs. Rose's car,

11:25.859 --> 11:27.817
and one on the back windshield.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.863
- It was shattered!
- The windshield?

11:29.906 --> 11:32.039
- The egg! That's the bestial
level of attack

11:32.082 --> 11:34.128
with which we are dealing.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.477
Right, Stevie?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.000
- I don't know, you tell me.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.307
- Well, you know, after
this little interview

11:39.350 --> 11:40.917
in People Magazine,

11:40.961 --> 11:44.486
I'm surprised those eggs
weren't actually thrown at you.

11:44.529 --> 11:47.707
- Has it hit the stands?
My publicist is off today.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.925
- It sure has.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.884
You describe the town as,
and I quote,

11:50.927 --> 11:53.451
"the last place you'd ever
wanna end up."

11:53.495 --> 11:55.497
- Oh no, I described the town
as the last place

11:55.540 --> 11:57.281
I'd ever want to end up.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.327
- Um, since I'm no longer
the star witness

11:59.370 --> 12:01.198
in this criminal case,
can I get back to work?

12:01.242 --> 12:04.680
- No, you see here,
I'm exaggerating for effect.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.551
And I made sure to never
mention the name

12:06.595 --> 12:07.857
of your precious borough.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.859
- I'm gonna take that
as a "yes."

12:09.903 --> 12:11.818
Roland: It wasn't hard
to figure out, Moira,

12:11.861 --> 12:13.733
somebody posted it
on the town message board,

12:13.776 --> 12:15.865
and now tempers
are running hot.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.694
- Yeah, Bob was so upset
he had to go home.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.652
- You know, Moira,
this bad press

12:20.696 --> 12:22.437
could not have come
at a worse time.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.918
We were just about to launch
a huge tourism campaign,

12:24.961 --> 12:26.876
and now thanks to you,

12:26.920 --> 12:28.617
this could be the biggest
scandal since we installed

12:28.660 --> 12:30.575
the church wheelchair ramp
backwards.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.099
- Roland, something
has to be done!

12:32.142 --> 12:34.014
It's a simple miscommunication.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.364
Do you want Stevie to be
cleaning eggs off my car

12:36.407 --> 12:38.061
every morning?!

12:38.105 --> 12:40.585
- Moira, you're gonna have
to clean up this mess yourself,

12:40.629 --> 12:42.979
Okay? We're spending a lot
of money on this campaign,

12:43.023 --> 12:45.416
and we can't afford
another "ramp-gate."

12:46.853 --> 12:48.419
- [Sucks her teeth]

12:51.553 --> 12:53.816
[Protestors mutter angrily]

12:53.860 --> 12:55.426
[Booing, hollering]

12:55.470 --> 12:57.472
Woman: Why'd you do it?!

12:57.515 --> 12:59.039
Why'd you do it?!

12:59.082 --> 13:00.823
- Ooh, I think they're here
for you, Moira!

13:00.867 --> 13:03.434
- Hey uh, folks, I can't quite
read those signs,

13:03.478 --> 13:05.915
do you mind holding them up
a little higher for me, there?

13:05.959 --> 13:08.265
Oh yeah, thanks.

13:08.309 --> 13:11.268
- You know what's often more
potent than an apology,

13:11.312 --> 13:13.009
is an explanation.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.229
You know, I may have said
this town is the last place

13:15.272 --> 13:17.057
I wish to find myself,

13:17.100 --> 13:20.887
but the magazine neglected
to include my entire quote.

13:20.930 --> 13:24.804
I specifically commended
your ever-beating heart,

13:24.847 --> 13:27.110
and your elephantine
generosity.

13:27.154 --> 13:30.853
"A slice of heaven," is what
I recall myself saying!

13:32.028 --> 13:34.683
Please know that I believe,
deep down,

13:34.726 --> 13:37.120
there are worse places to be.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.253
- Like in your shoes right now.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.298
- Would a quick meet and greet
help?

13:41.342 --> 13:44.301
I do have a few headshots
in the boot of my car.

13:44.345 --> 13:46.173
- No, I don't think you need
more people knowing

13:46.216 --> 13:48.958
which car is yours, Moira,
but I do have an idea

13:49.002 --> 13:51.091
that I think will solve
all our problems.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.875
- Okay, but can we discuss it
over lunch?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.790
I pre-ordered a tuna sandwich,

13:54.834 --> 13:56.966
and those things can turn
on a dime.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.881
- Oh, allow me to leave you
with this.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.797
I solemnly vow to make right
by all of you.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.408
As soon as one of you details
my car.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.280
[Protesters exclaim angrily]

14:06.323 --> 14:07.585
- Receipt in the bag?

14:07.629 --> 14:10.110
There you go, bye.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.981
- I don't wanna rub salt
in the wound here, David,

14:12.025 --> 14:14.505
but Jocelyn is kinda
crushing it.

14:14.549 --> 14:17.204
- Okay, I have also had a very
active day on the sales floor.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.336
- David, she has sold
more in one day

14:19.380 --> 14:21.034
than we have all week.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.687
And you've spent the better
part of the afternoon

14:22.731 --> 14:24.864
standing in the corner
giving her cut-eye.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.257
- I'm mentoring her,
and monitoring her progress.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.303
And frankly, it's not moving
as fast as I'd like.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.479
- Why can't you just admit
that she is an asset?

14:31.522 --> 14:32.959
- It's probably beginner's
luck,

14:33.002 --> 14:35.004
like when you walk into
a casino and win big

14:35.048 --> 14:37.311
on your first pull of the
"Basic Instinct" slot machine.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.313
- Okay, I'm beginning to think
that that is the high point

14:39.356 --> 14:40.880
of your entire life.
- All I'm saying is,

14:40.923 --> 14:42.533
I don't necessarily trust
the numbers.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.187
- Oh.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.276
- I had an ex in San Francisco
who was a real estate agent,

14:46.320 --> 14:48.235
and basically made all
of our friends buy penthouses

14:48.278 --> 14:50.106
just to make it look like
he was doing well.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.892
For all we know, these could
just be Jocelyn's friends.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.416
- Well, friends or not,
that's still a sale.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.679
- Yeah, but is that what
we're really about?

14:57.722 --> 15:00.073
Like, just selling products?

15:00.116 --> 15:02.205
- Yep, that is literally
the purpose of our store.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.294
Look, I didn't expect this
from Jocelyn either,

15:04.338 --> 15:06.383
but clearly, she has
a connection to the people

15:06.427 --> 15:08.864
of this community, and I say
we make the most of it.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.258
- Okay, so what, you want
to offer her a job?

15:11.301 --> 15:13.956
- Well, I think the offer would
mean more coming from you.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.741
- Another sale, boys!
[Bell jingles]

15:17.699 --> 15:19.570
- Where'd she get that bell?

15:19.614 --> 15:21.181
- She brought it from home.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.358
[Door shuts]

15:24.401 --> 15:25.663
[Alexis groans]

15:26.664 --> 15:29.493
[Door opens and slams shut]

15:29.537 --> 15:31.191
[Purse thuds, keys jingle]

15:31.234 --> 15:33.323
- [Sighs]

15:33.367 --> 15:34.846
Ugh!

15:34.890 --> 15:36.936
[Knock on door, door opens]

15:36.979 --> 15:39.808
- Hi honey, everything okay?

15:39.851 --> 15:41.418
- Yeah, everything is great.

15:41.462 --> 15:44.073
My life is going like, really,
really great right now!

15:44.117 --> 15:46.771
- Oh, well, that's uh,
that's good.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.730
- Here's a fun thing,
I just got dumped

15:48.773 --> 15:50.558
by a man who wears three
medic-alert bracelets.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.603
- Really?

15:52.647 --> 15:54.954
- He just said out of nowhere
that he needs to end things.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.087
- Oh, well, that
that does seem abrupt.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.741
Wow, well...

15:59.784 --> 16:01.786
maybe-maybe that's just further
confirmation

16:01.830 --> 16:03.919
that you know, he...

16:03.963 --> 16:06.095
he wasn't... he wasn't
the right person for you?

16:06.139 --> 16:08.097
- I know he's not the right
person for me.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.273
His taste in makeout music,
for example,

16:10.317 --> 16:11.971
like, so weird.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.929
Like, who even is Cat Stevens?!

16:14.886 --> 16:18.455
- Well, Cat wrote some
wonderful songs, honey.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.805
- I'm just looking for like,
any distraction

16:20.849 --> 16:22.372
from the fact that my heart's
shattered

16:22.416 --> 16:24.113
into a million pieces.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.115
Like, I don't even know
what I'm doing anymore.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.683
I'm getting broken up
with by gross old men!

16:28.726 --> 16:30.206
- Oh, honey, no,

16:30.250 --> 16:32.382
he-he-he wasn't that gross.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.472
No, I mean, he-he seemed...
nice.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.561
He was responsible.

16:37.605 --> 16:40.129
He did run a successful
mobile-home business.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.654
- How did you know about that?

16:43.698 --> 16:45.526
- What?
- How did you know that?

16:45.569 --> 16:47.528
- I-uh, where did I hear that?

16:47.571 --> 16:48.964
- You talked to him!

16:49.008 --> 16:51.097
- Well, I-I just for--
I did talk to him.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.229
Brief conversation,
but just in passing.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.014
- Why would you do that?

16:55.057 --> 16:57.146
I told you that I was
in control of the situation.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.627
- Well, honey, I don't know
whether you were.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.065
I was just trying to... help.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.243
Alexis, in the past, I...

17:07.287 --> 17:10.507
I couldn't always be there
for you when you were...

17:10.551 --> 17:12.683
when you were dealing with...

17:13.945 --> 17:16.470
heartbreak.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.689
I wasn't there to protect you.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.865
And I guess I was just being...

17:20.909 --> 17:23.216
a bit overzealous, and...

17:24.391 --> 17:26.697
trying to make up
for lost time.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.699
- Well, if you really
wanna know,

17:28.743 --> 17:31.006
I dated guys like, a whole
lot worse than Artie.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.574
Where were you when I was
dating half the cast
