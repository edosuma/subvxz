WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.842
[sensual music playing]

00:08.967 --> 00:10.719
[buzzing]

00:10.802 --> 00:12.303
I know that sound.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.638
[chuckles]

00:13.722 --> 00:16.599
[Gwyneth]
We have been living in this society,

00:16.683 --> 00:20.812
and all of us have been fed
all of these messages

00:20.895 --> 00:25.108
that continue to get us further away
from who we actually are

00:25.191 --> 00:27.027
and how we actually feel…

00:27.110 --> 00:28.194
[Erika] Oh my God.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.779
…and what we actually want.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.158
[Darshana] We're going to focus
more on sexual activity.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.410
You don't see this every day,
[laughs] I tell you what.

00:35.493 --> 00:39.706
It's our responsibility to come back
to the center of who we are…

00:40.832 --> 00:42.459
We had sex homework.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.127
Her energy was like…

00:44.210 --> 00:45.253
[buzzes]

00:45.795 --> 00:47.380
[Gwyneth] …and to act from that place.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.049
[whispers] Will you go deeper?

00:49.716 --> 00:50.842
And who doesn't want that?

00:55.096 --> 00:59.434
Today, we're going to start now
integrating what you've learned here.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.186
You're here having an experience,

01:01.269 --> 01:03.480
but what's important is
integrating this at home.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.191
-Right, exactly.
-This is just an experience otherwise.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.150
-Right?
-Right.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.028
And so,
in terms of integrating, is I want us

01:10.111 --> 01:12.697
to think about how to create
these containers at home.

01:12.781 --> 01:13.656
Okay.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.450
So, a container is simply just

01:15.533 --> 01:20.288
being conscious about what it is
that you are going to explore erotically.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.833
So, it's something that
holds us in our erotic exploration,

01:23.917 --> 01:27.545
so that we can expand all the way
to the edges of that container.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.256
If we have no container,
we stay like this.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.886
Whereas, if we have a container,
we can explore all the way to the edges.

01:34.969 --> 01:38.640
So, the way that you set a container at
home is, "Here's what we wanna explore."

01:38.723 --> 01:39.766
Mm-hmm.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.977
The duration is how long
you're going to do the experiment,

01:43.061 --> 01:45.313
and then the last piece is the follow-up.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.481
What worked about this?

01:46.564 --> 01:48.983
What was awesome?
What do you want to do more of?

01:49.067 --> 01:52.654
[soft percussive music playing]

01:54.572 --> 01:57.659
Setting the container and the context.
So, the context for this

01:57.742 --> 02:02.622
is that he is the artiste,
and you are the piece of art.

02:02.705 --> 02:05.333
You're going to become
a living piece of art here.

02:05.416 --> 02:09.754
You get to pose her,
like a goddess pose with your arms out,

02:09.838 --> 02:13.091
and then that becomes like
the bondage of the ropes, right?

02:13.174 --> 02:18.847
She has to keep her hands, or she can move
every now and then, and you let her move.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.223
Nice.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.851
Part of integrating for any couple

02:22.934 --> 02:25.436
is taking something
they already have in their life,

02:26.688 --> 02:29.649
and put it into a fun game
and use it in their sex life.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.860
Knowing that he was an artist,

02:31.943 --> 02:33.194
I just had this thought,

02:33.278 --> 02:35.697
one of the main things
that's gonna bring this home

02:35.780 --> 02:39.409
was for him to incorporate her
as the work of art.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.744
I want you to do this.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.790
[mellow percussive music playing]

02:53.464 --> 02:55.258
[Jaiya] So, now we're in design.

02:57.468 --> 03:00.096
Kind of him moving
through the energetic blueprint,

03:00.180 --> 03:03.266
playing with it, but the kinky,
and setting up the context

03:03.349 --> 03:05.435
of, she has to hold these poses.

03:05.518 --> 03:09.898
And then the sensuality
of the brush on her body

03:09.981 --> 03:11.649
and her being able to feel that.

03:12.984 --> 03:13.818
All right.

03:15.945 --> 03:19.073
[Jaiya] So we're using these blueprints
that were her primary blueprints,

03:19.157 --> 03:22.535
energetic, kinky and sensual.

03:22.619 --> 03:27.373
But we're tying it into this thing that
he does on a regular basis with his art

03:27.457 --> 03:30.251
by making her that piece of art.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.715
There. Right there. Oh. [laughs]

03:35.798 --> 03:36.966
Oh, wow.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.135
[laughs]

03:39.260 --> 03:43.348
You are a gorgeous warrior goddess.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.474
[chuckles]

03:45.058 --> 03:46.517
[Jaiya] We're innovating.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.354
How can you innovate
more in your erotic life

03:49.437 --> 03:51.189
before things go south?

03:51.731 --> 03:55.193
With this, we're going to go
through each sense at a time.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.112
-[Damon] Okay.
-[Jaiya] So, there will be tastes.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.156
There will be touch,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.367
there will be sounds,

04:02.450 --> 04:06.537
and there will be smells that
you will be experiencing throughout this.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.123
So, take a deep breath.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.714
And you're going to begin
to be touched by things.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.757
Mm.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.053
[Jaiya] We take sex way too seriously.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.097
We have to put play back into it.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.559
Now just open up your ears.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.936
[popping]

04:30.019 --> 04:31.437
[scraping]

04:33.273 --> 04:36.651
Sound, touch, mixing it all together now.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.237
[dings]

04:40.446 --> 04:42.699
[soft rustling]

04:42.782 --> 04:45.159
-Open up.
-[Erika] You don't have your eyesight.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.662
You're having to use all your senses.

04:48.413 --> 04:52.125
You can kind of guide your head to what
you're hearing or what you're feeling.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.877
[whispers] You're beautiful.

04:55.420 --> 05:00.049
The mystery of it, that kind of in itself,
was just refreshing.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.678
-I noticed you really responding to sound.
-Yeah.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.888
Damon, your voice is very sexy.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.558
-I don't think about it as much, but…
-[chuckles]

05:08.641 --> 05:11.185
It's like, "Oh, nice."

05:12.562 --> 05:15.023
You wanna play a little
with this sound we're discovering,

05:15.106 --> 05:16.566
-'cause it's also energetic.
-Mm-hmm.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.278
Just come up to her heart,
and you're gonna go like, "Ah,"

05:20.361 --> 05:23.740
a deep "ah" sound over her heart.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.117
Ah…

05:26.868 --> 05:29.120
[all chuckle]

05:29.203 --> 05:30.246
[Jaiya] I love it.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.164
[humming]

05:31.247 --> 05:33.333
[Jaiya] Oh, yes.
You feel the vibration of that.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.834
Yeah, I like that one. Yeah.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.253
Damon and Erika learned
all this stuff on the table,

05:37.337 --> 05:40.465
but then to take what they learned
and put it into a fun game

05:40.548 --> 05:43.885
and see how they could put that
into context and use it in their sex life,

05:43.968 --> 05:46.429
it takes it into fun,
and it takes it into play.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.181
'Cause this experience is great,

05:48.264 --> 05:51.309
but doesn't mean anything
if they go home to their default mode.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.436
Both of you are going to be blindfolded.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.521
You're going to find him.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.773
Oh.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.400
So, it's a game of hide-and-seek.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.570
But you're feeling the energy.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.615
So, now begin.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.660
Go slow.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.246
-Okay.
-Feel. Go even slower.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.541
Perceive with your bodies.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.011
[Erika] There's so many possibilities
with what we learned today

06:27.095 --> 06:29.514
that's just got my mind going crazy.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.059
Like, you can incorporate games,
you can incorporate music,

06:33.142 --> 06:36.187
you can incorporate food, blindfolds.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.524
When we were both blindfolded,
I was moving around like…

06:40.691 --> 06:43.903
I knew there was
a really big prize around here somewhere.

06:43.986 --> 06:44.821
[both laugh]

06:47.407 --> 06:50.201
[Jaiya] Just hold here.
Breathe together for a moment.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.454
That was hot. That was pretty hot.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.126
Just share with each other
something that was awesome about that.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.295
It felt like I was hunting her out.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.172
-[Jaiya] Mm.
-Yeah.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.426
Like she was in some bushes,
and I was, like, trying to find her.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.510
[laughs]

07:07.593 --> 07:09.846
-[Jaiya] And was that exciting for you?
-Yeah.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.932
Because there's your kinky access
right there.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.183
We just found it.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.645
-Nice.
-We just found your access into the kinky.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.231
I gotta make you
get down and hunt more often.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.316
[Jaiya laughs] Uh-huh.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.737
[Damon] I love that we found
some kink that she's into,

07:27.405 --> 07:31.534
and I'm into it because she's into it,
and now I'm into it because…

07:31.617 --> 07:33.244
-You're into it.
-…I'm into it.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.412
[both laugh]

07:34.495 --> 07:35.455
[kisses]

07:36.664 --> 07:39.333
[Gwyneth] We don't learn
a lot of honest communication.

07:39.417 --> 07:43.463
If we're all brave enough to really start
to peel back the layers of our own onion,

07:43.546 --> 07:45.631
get truly in touch with who we are,

07:45.715 --> 07:48.718
and be brave about
the communication of those things,

07:48.801 --> 07:51.762
we would be able to really get somewhere.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.265
It's hard to ask your partner too.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.101
"Is this okay? Do you like this?"

07:57.185 --> 08:01.814
I tend to overthink things a lot,
and I think, "Is this a good idea?"

08:01.898 --> 08:04.984
And if I want to try something new,
I'll keep it inside.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.279
One aspect in communication is learning

08:08.362 --> 08:12.867
why is it so hard to speak
with somebody who you actually love?

08:12.950 --> 08:15.203
And how can we bridge that?

08:15.286 --> 08:19.415
[mellow percussive music playing]

08:28.841 --> 08:31.802
We're gonna do this
in a deliberate structure,

08:31.886 --> 08:34.472
where one of you
is gonna be the active giver,

08:34.555 --> 08:37.808
and the other
the active receiver of the touch.

08:38.893 --> 08:43.231
I would like to be more communicative

08:43.314 --> 08:46.692
during sex or before sex,
or even about sex,

08:46.776 --> 08:50.821
and I would like to be
more comfortable talking about,

08:50.905 --> 08:52.782
"This is what I would like."

08:53.824 --> 08:55.368
"Can I please have this?"

08:55.451 --> 08:57.787
Are you comfortable? Do you want to shift?

08:58.829 --> 09:00.998
-Ah.
-[chuckles]

09:01.082 --> 09:05.044
Now… And this is, like,
a teachable moment.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.047
We're used to keeping
ourselves in discomfort

09:08.130 --> 09:10.550
to try to make someone else comfortable.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.553
That was a great example.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.305
What's gonna make me comfortable
is your comfort.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.223
Mm.

09:17.306 --> 09:20.476
For Camille, a lot of this work is about

09:20.560 --> 09:24.480
how she navigates
not needing to appease other people

09:24.564 --> 09:27.692
at the cost of her own basic comfort,

09:27.775 --> 09:32.905
and so a lot of this work is about
embodying a new way of relating,

09:32.989 --> 09:35.533
and having that be imprinted.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.202
So, you need to give some guidance…

09:38.286 --> 09:39.704
-Absolutely.
-…as the receiver.

09:39.787 --> 09:44.083
What I'm gonna invite you to do right now
is consider, "Well, what would I like?"

09:44.166 --> 09:49.797
I would like to lay on my stomach and
for you to give me compression on my back…

09:49.880 --> 09:51.632
-Yeah. Of course.
-…if that's possible.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.386
-Want me to sit on you?
-I kinda like--

09:55.469 --> 09:58.180
You moved because you weren't
sitting on me, but I like it when you do.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.557
-Want me to sit on you?
-Yeah.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.475
-[Darshana] Straddle her.
-All right.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.853
And, Camille, good job
asking for what you want.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.480
Thank you. Will you sit back more? Like--

10:06.564 --> 10:09.817
No, don't move.
Just put more weight. Yeah.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.235
-On your butt?
-Yeah.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.739
Can you keep your hands
on my rib cage and just press down?

10:14.822 --> 10:16.324
Like that? Okay.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.912
[Darshana]
Beautiful specificity in your request.

10:21.996 --> 10:22.997
Thank you.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.504
-You mind if I flip back over?
-Yeah.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.967
Put your legs behind my legs…

10:35.051 --> 10:36.677
-Okay.
-…and just hug me.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.262
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, please.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.972
[Darshana] Oh.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.600
Yeah.

10:55.863 --> 11:00.076
Now we're going to explore
sexological bodywork with you, Camille.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.578
-So let's get ready for it, shall we?
-Okay.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.788
Let's do it.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.999
Recently, I was asking
a group of my friends,

11:07.083 --> 11:10.586
"You know, what is your comfort
for asking for something?"

11:11.337 --> 11:16.258
And almost no one at the table
felt comfortable asking for something,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.011
even in a really healthy relationship

11:19.095 --> 11:21.430
where they felt
really safe with the person.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.935
So I don't know if that's changing now
in these next generations,

11:26.018 --> 11:28.646
but I still think I have
a lot of work to do with that.

11:28.729 --> 11:34.860
Like, I think it's so imprinted to just,
like, go along with everything, you know?

11:34.944 --> 11:40.741
Yeah. I think that is something to
aspire to for anyone in a relationship,

11:40.825 --> 11:43.202
is that you are able to say, uh…

11:43.285 --> 11:45.788
Oh, and simple things like,
"I'd like milk in my coffee."

11:45.871 --> 11:49.417
They put half and half, and you go,
"I'd like milk in my coffee," right?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.585
-Right.
-That's how you build boundaries…

11:51.669 --> 11:53.337
-Yeah.
-…with that little stuff.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.923
That's like…
You know, it's like a workout.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.843
And then you can set
the proper big boundary,

11:58.926 --> 12:02.638
because you actually have practice
where it doesn't matter that much.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.724
[birds chirping]

12:06.100 --> 12:07.768
[Jaiya] Just hold her close and…

12:09.478 --> 12:10.563
sway a little.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.899
He gives the best hugs ever.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.945
I invite you to play this evening.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.658
Maybe you feed her some in that blindfold.
Take that blindfold home with you tonight.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.118
Oh, nice.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.163
And your homework is going to be

12:27.246 --> 12:29.290
lovemaking with that blindfold on.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.958
[Damon chuckles]

12:31.083 --> 12:33.252
-[Jaiya laughs]
-Oh, different.

12:33.335 --> 12:36.255
[Jaiya] And "lovemaking"
doesn't necessarily mean intercourse.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.757
Intercourse could be included.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.801
And then afterwards
have a little discussion

12:40.885 --> 12:43.763
about, how did this go?
How's that homework sound?

12:43.846 --> 12:47.308
-That sounds awesome. I'll take it.
-It does. [chuckles]

12:47.391 --> 12:48.350
Is that right?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.770
Let's hear your sexy voice right now.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.937
[Jaiya] Have fun.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.564
-Okay.
-[all laugh]

12:53.647 --> 12:54.732
[Erika] Thanks, Jaiya.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.287
[Erika] Look at how
you eating that fry, baby.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.246
[laughs]

13:09.330 --> 13:15.044
We're sitting here trying to map out what
we're gonna do tonight for our homework.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.630
I'm thinking blindfolds.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.758
And just, like,
maybe check on each other's energy.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.676
-Some light touching.
-Mm-hmm.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.596
Pretty sure I can find something
around here to tie you down.

13:25.679 --> 13:26.514
Oh.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.314
To be continued.

13:37.525 --> 13:42.738
[soft percussive music playing]

13:50.579 --> 13:54.041
[Darshana]
Just go ahead and flip onto the table.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.710
-[Camille] My feet are very cold.
-Then I will…

13:56.794 --> 14:00.005
Thank you! You're gonna get a blanket
on your feet because you said so.

14:00.089 --> 14:00.923
Yes.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.675
That is how this works.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.844
-Tell me what you need, you get it.
-[giggles]

14:04.927 --> 14:06.804
[Darshana]
You're ultimately in control here.

14:08.055 --> 14:12.685
All right. I'd love to just do a little
general, like, pelvic-region massage.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.232
Sex bod is one-directional in nature,

14:18.315 --> 14:22.444
because many people… Like, the only way
we come to know things about our sex

14:22.528 --> 14:24.238
is usually connecting with a partner.

14:24.947 --> 14:29.618
And I know that compression has been
a really enjoyable touch for you.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.037
All the partner dynamics
come into the mix.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.833
It's like, "Oh my God. Are they okay?
Do I smell okay? Do I look okay?"

14:35.916 --> 14:40.212
Like, all the stuff that comes
into the room when it's inter-relational

14:40.296 --> 14:43.465
prevents a lot of people
from having a chance to get to know

14:43.549 --> 14:45.885
whatever their home base is.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.553
Sometimes, what's really nice

14:47.636 --> 14:53.267
is to vacillate between, like,
the firm, steady compression

14:53.350 --> 14:57.605
and then to have, like, very soft touch.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.567
And so sex bod really provides that.

15:01.650 --> 15:05.237
It's an opportunity where you do not
have to be thinking about somebody else.

15:05.321 --> 15:09.366
And for a lot of people it's like, "Whoa!"

15:09.450 --> 15:11.327
Because they've never had that before.

15:12.202 --> 15:18.459
And I'm going to now come right
up the center and now over your clitoris.

15:18.542 --> 15:23.547
Does this touch do anything for you,
good, bad, or otherwise?

15:23.631 --> 15:27.092
-Not really. I'm indifferent about it.
-Not really? Okay.

15:28.260 --> 15:32.181
And now, how about this?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.892
Yeah, that's… I like that more.

15:34.975 --> 15:40.522
Okay, so, the first touch was just
me gliding over your clitoral hood.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.484
Now I'm pinching both sides.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.653
So, I want you to see this, 'cause…

15:46.487 --> 15:49.198
The glans of her clitoris
is sitting right in there.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.075
I feel it like a little pearl.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.119
I'm wondering
how that feels to you, Camille.

15:54.912 --> 15:58.582
I don't mind the bottom part,
but the top part I'm not enjoying.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.625
-[Darshana] That?
-Yes.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.542
Done.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.835
And the, "I don't mind,"

16:01.919 --> 16:05.464
like, that's not actually
a satisfying enough answer for me, so--

16:05.547 --> 16:07.341
"It's all right. I don't mind."

16:07.424 --> 16:10.135
Yeah, we're not doing "I don't mind."

16:10.219 --> 16:11.762
We're not doing "tolerating."

16:11.845 --> 16:13.347
-I don't like it.
-We're doing, like …

16:13.430 --> 16:15.307
"This is what feels good
to my body. I want that."

16:15.391 --> 16:16.225
Okay.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.313
I'm enjoying that, like,
soft in one and firm in the other.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.232
Soft in one, firm in the other?

16:23.315 --> 16:24.608
Ooh. Thanks.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.360
So we'll do that.

16:28.112 --> 16:33.909
This is a great way to invite
a gradual building of arousal.

16:34.910 --> 16:38.372
Anything you want to ask, please know
that you can be included in this too.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.875
Yeah, of course. I'm good right now, but…

16:41.959 --> 16:43.877
I'm just observing now.

16:46.505 --> 16:50.092
I think I might be ready for toys,
if that's an option.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.469
-[Darshana] You know it is.
-I know.

16:52.970 --> 16:53.971
Okay.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.434
Monsieur.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.561
[laughs]

17:00.644 --> 17:03.522
I would be interested to start
with something that vibrates.

17:03.605 --> 17:04.857
-This is it?
-Yeah.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.150
-Okay.
-All right.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.487
[Darshana] I really loved that
she wanted to experiment

17:10.571 --> 17:12.322
with some of the different toys,

17:12.406 --> 17:16.118
and I wanted her to feel
very encouraged and empowered

17:16.201 --> 17:18.203
in her choices around that.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.873
So, just, like, a nice…

17:20.956 --> 17:23.042
I can give you that kind--

17:23.125 --> 17:25.419
-The pressure. I like it.
-You like that. There.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.547
Like, we know that. You like compression.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.590
I do.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.845
[buzzing]

17:34.928 --> 17:37.056
You want me to go deeper or stay there?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.474
-Deeper.
-Deeper?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.310
It's all the way.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.188
Would you like to drive?

17:44.271 --> 17:46.231
-No.
-No. [laughs]

17:48.067 --> 17:50.277
So, I can still rub her perineum,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.946
then I can really give her compression,

17:53.030 --> 17:56.283
and then the vibrator's doing
all the rest of the work. [chuckles]

17:57.993 --> 18:00.954
-It is.
-[Darshana laughs]

18:01.914 --> 18:07.294
I feel more present than I have
ever felt before too, which is… new.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.212
[Darshana] Yeah.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.216
[gasps softly]

18:12.299 --> 18:13.884
[whispers] Will you go deeper?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.386
[moans] Uh-huh.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.680
[Darshana]
Ask for what you want, you get it.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.601
[moans]

18:27.397 --> 18:28.607
Oh God.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.568
[panting]

18:31.652 --> 18:32.653
[Darshana] Breathe.

18:32.736 --> 18:33.821
[exhales]

18:33.904 --> 18:36.323
[buzzing continues]

18:40.452 --> 18:41.370
[Darshana] Yeah.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.205
Why am I still convulsing?

18:43.288 --> 18:47.918
[Darshana] Sweetheart, this can go on
for a good long while, you just let it.

18:48.001 --> 18:52.589
A slow-building eruption
with multiple waves,

18:52.673 --> 18:54.675
and then the aftershocks that rippled out,

18:54.758 --> 18:57.469
which was a very new experience for her.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.932
Your tears, your orgasm,
they're not separate.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.523
I feel, like, paralyzed almost.
Like I can't move.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.650
[Shandra] You don't have to.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.654
She hadn't known
something like that in her body before.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.949
So, now it's not just like,
"Oh my God, I had an orgasm,"

19:19.032 --> 19:23.871
it's, "Wow. Like,
I had that kind of orgasm."

19:23.954 --> 19:27.291
"That is possible in my body."

19:27.374 --> 19:29.543
That originated from her body.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.878
Oh, thank you.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.547
[Camille] I just got back to my room.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.632
I don't know what else
to say but, like, holy shit.

19:35.716 --> 19:40.721
I'm kind of questioning
if I've ever had an orgasm before,

19:40.804 --> 19:45.142
because I don't think I've ever had
anything that's ever felt like that.

19:46.143 --> 19:50.189
The literal vibrations that are
happening through my body right now…

19:50.981 --> 19:55.319
I feel alive, and I feel like…

19:55.402 --> 19:59.698
I don't know how else
to say it, but I feel real.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.284
I feel like a real person right now,

20:02.367 --> 20:04.995
and, um… it's…

20:06.747 --> 20:08.373
It's wild to me.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.626
I'm in shock, so…

20:18.133 --> 20:21.220
[Jaiya] Okay, so I want to check in
on homework last night.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.598
-Fireworks.
-It was awesome.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.476
[Damon] She was ramped up,

20:28.185 --> 20:29.686
and her energy was like…

20:29.770 --> 20:31.104
[buzzing]

20:31.188 --> 20:32.606
-That's awesome.
-[Erika laughs]

20:32.689 --> 20:35.525
I think it was just freeing,
and not in your head as much.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.861
-Yay! That was the goal.
-You're not in your head.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.322
I mean, for the most part, I was…

20:40.405 --> 20:43.200
I was just, you know, going for the ride.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.994
-[laughs]
-You don't have to do much.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.872
-No, yeah.
-That less is more piece, right?

20:48.956 --> 20:52.376
And, actually, I was the one that was,
like, initiating the penetration.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.294
-It did surprise me. It did…
-Uh-huh.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.172
I was like, "Oh, Erika."
But I was like, "I'm going with it."

20:57.256 --> 20:58.590
-Yay!
-[Damon] Yeah.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.009
And I was on top, and it was awesome.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.219
You knew what to do on top.

21:02.302 --> 21:06.556
Yeah. I was kind of moving differently,
and it was just kind of rolling with it.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.767
And I was like,
"Oh, I'm rolling pretty good."

21:08.850 --> 21:10.227
[all laugh]

21:10.310 --> 21:12.396
And we both had orgasms.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.438
-You did?
-Yeah.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.023
-Oh, yeah.
-Which was awesome.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.567
I mean, you forgot about that part?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.528
-That's the other big highlight.
-I love that.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.114
I love that you just
forgot about that part.

21:22.197 --> 21:26.159
Because it's not… The focus
has been taken off of having orgasms…

21:26.243 --> 21:27.077
Yeah.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.789
And now you're in
the enjoyment of all of the pleasure.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.666
A-plus-plus-plus-plus.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.543
-A-plus-plus.
-[laughs]

21:34.626 --> 21:36.086
-Congratulations.
-[Erika] Thank you.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.548
Really, congratulations to both of you,
because this doesn't always happen.

21:39.631 --> 21:43.510
Sometimes I have to work with a couple
for a year. We fast-tracked this,

21:43.593 --> 21:47.306
and part of what made it so successful
was your willingness, so, beautiful.

21:47.931 --> 21:52.227
It was just so huge and magical
that they'd had that growth,

21:52.311 --> 21:53.937
and that we'd met the outcomes.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.483
It's why I do this work.
It's those moments. It's worth it.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.321
It doesn't end here, but once you go home,

22:02.404 --> 22:05.866
that's, you know, that's the key,
is that we're designing your sex life.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.327
-Not letting it go into default.
-Right.

22:08.410 --> 22:12.664
[Jaiya] Too many people
wait until there's a crisis,

22:12.748 --> 22:15.292
versus the smart couple who says,

22:15.375 --> 22:20.005
"Let's do all this and explore all this,"
just because they're hungry.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.550
So, have that hunger,
because that hunger is

22:23.633 --> 22:26.678
what's gonna keep it passionate
and hot for the rest of your lives.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.931
Okay, so I want to close
with wins, insights, and learnings

22:30.015 --> 22:32.267
-from our entire time together.
-Uh…

22:32.351 --> 22:35.354
A really big win-insight for me was

22:35.437 --> 22:39.524
to dive into the idea
that we're both energetics,

22:39.608 --> 22:42.110
and feel you completely.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.362
Thank you.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.990
I learned that my clitoris isn't broken.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.992
-[laughs]
-[Jaiya] Yay!

22:49.076 --> 22:52.371
It's fully intact and 360.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.456
[both laugh]

22:55.749 --> 22:57.000
I learned

22:58.377 --> 22:59.920
that my wife is kind of kinky.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.046
[laughs]

23:01.129 --> 23:03.006
[Erika] A win…

23:03.090 --> 23:04.883
We came here and did this together.

23:04.966 --> 23:08.011
I think that's, like,
the biggest win of all, really.

23:08.095 --> 23:11.181
I think that, you know,
the step that we took to even

23:11.681 --> 23:12.849
be brave enough…

23:12.933 --> 23:14.518
-Courage.
-…and honest enough and--

23:14.601 --> 23:18.021
Yeah, the courage that we had
to say that we needed help,

23:18.105 --> 23:21.650
and we don't know
what we're doing a lot of times.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.944
So, thank you so much.

23:25.028 --> 23:25.862
Thank you.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.657
I wanna thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.325
It's been a pleasure.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.786
[all chuckle]

23:35.414 --> 23:36.581
Oh my gosh.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.542
Mmm.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.627
[percussive music playing]

23:45.799 --> 23:47.008
[laughs]

23:52.889 --> 23:54.015
[woman 1] Hug somebody.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.143
[woman 2] You guys are awesome.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.894
[Erika speaking indistinctly]

24:02.607 --> 24:04.818
[Gwyneth]
When we first started this project,

24:04.901 --> 24:08.363
I knew it was going to be
a profound experience for all of us,

24:08.447 --> 24:11.783
but this exceeded our expectations.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.328
[Jaiya] See this?
This is energetic orgasm.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.914
[Amina]
Introduce your animal to each other.

24:18.540 --> 24:23.837
[Michaela] Lead Felicitas on a little
journey through your inner landscape.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.299
[Darshana] What do two
vulva-bearing bodies do together?

24:27.382 --> 24:32.679
It's been extraordinary to realize just
how much there is that we don't know

24:32.762 --> 24:35.682
about who we really are as sexual beings.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.392
Your mom cannot watch this.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.978
[moaning]

24:40.061 --> 24:42.856
We owe a great deal
to the practitioners who took the risk

24:42.939 --> 24:46.443
of letting cameras document
their work for the very first time.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.320
We're not just showing up by the stork.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.323
We are actively fucking each other,

24:51.406 --> 24:55.118
and so somebody needs to start having
conversations about what that looks like.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.912
Thank you so much for sharing.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.915
[Gwyneth] The most gratitude
goes to the couples

24:59.998 --> 25:02.584
and their willingness
to be vulnerable on camera.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.337
Am I gonna have an orgasm
before I have a baby?

25:05.420 --> 25:09.466
I'm so excited
because they have such a chance now.

25:09.549 --> 25:12.719
[Dash] I mean, I'm open to, like,
doing more of this work.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.555
I really feel like
the possibilities are endless.

25:16.348 --> 25:20.560
For many of us, this journey
to full sexual realization means

25:20.644 --> 25:23.980
overcoming deeply entrenched
shame and negativity

25:24.064 --> 25:26.566
towards ourselves and our bodies.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.236
[Joie] I do have a negative body image.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.363
Amina's perspective,

25:31.446 --> 25:34.074
it's definitely made me
think about that more and more.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.701
-I, you know, earned these wrinkles.
-Yeah.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.912
We know that there is
no shame in needing help,

25:38.995 --> 25:42.832
because most of us are
shockingly ignorant about female anatomy.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.043
That's the whole clitoris.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.795
[chuckles]

25:46.878 --> 25:51.216
When Jaiya pulled out
the stuffed animal clitoris thing,

25:51.299 --> 25:53.009
I was, like, "Holy shit."

25:53.843 --> 25:56.471
There's no shame
about knowing about our ear.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.766
Why is there shame
about knowing about our genitals?

25:59.849 --> 26:01.643
This is my body.

26:01.726 --> 26:05.897
Is that the most beautiful woman
in the world walking through this door?

26:05.981 --> 26:08.149
-How are you?
-Hello.

26:08.233 --> 26:12.445
The biggest takeaways for me
were just taking your time.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.990
You know, I don't want
to feel any pain during sex.

26:15.073 --> 26:18.910
-And, luckily, lately, we haven't.
-Yeah.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.622
Did we just have sex
on the bathroom counter?

26:22.706 --> 26:23.582
Maybe.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.084
The bottom line is that there are

26:26.167 --> 26:28.962
transformational sex
and intimacy techniques

26:29.045 --> 26:31.673
you can learn if you're willing.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.426
Guess what came in the mail?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.511
Women's Anatomy of Arousal.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.846
[laughs]

26:38.513 --> 26:41.433
I think at the core of this work
and the core of sexuality

26:41.516 --> 26:43.935
is about uncovering, "Who am I really,

26:44.019 --> 26:46.855
underneath all of
the cultural conditioning?"

26:46.938 --> 26:50.525
[Felicitas] It's refreshing
to learn that sex and romance

26:50.609 --> 26:54.237
do not just
come easily years into a marriage,

26:54.321 --> 26:58.325
but that seems to be
the work that is worth doing.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.703
Even though the road to get there
is super uncomfortable

27:01.786 --> 27:05.874
and maybe full of tears or,
you know, hard to process,

27:05.957 --> 27:10.211
that's our right to do that, and it's
our right to really listen to ourselves.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.756
I don't say these words casually

27:12.839 --> 27:17.427
when I say, like, it changes everything
when you claim your erotic wholeness.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.388
We're just getting started. [laughs]

27:20.472 --> 27:25.018
I think the takeaway was, "Gosh, it's
a lot simpler than we think," you know?

27:25.101 --> 27:28.396
It's like, if you really get
super honest with yourself,

27:28.480 --> 27:31.149
like all of the couples in this series do,

27:31.232 --> 27:34.527
life just starts to open up.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.489
[Damon] She's pregnant.
We're having a baby.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.575
[Erika] All right, we're gonna
turn 'em around and see. One, two…

27:41.451 --> 27:42.911
[both gasp]

27:42.994 --> 27:44.829
[both laugh]

27:44.913 --> 27:47.040
It's a boy!

27:47.123 --> 27:49.125
Oh, congratulations, baby.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.628
-Oh baby.
-[laughs]

27:51.711 --> 27:53.963
Thank you, Jaiya. Congratulations to us,

27:54.547 --> 27:58.426
via the work we did through your sex camp.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.928
[laughs]

28:01.262 --> 28:03.473
-Oh my gosh.
-[chuckles]

28:03.556 --> 28:05.100
Happy Father's Day, baby.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.143
[clinking]

28:08.603 --> 28:12.315
[upbeat music playing]
