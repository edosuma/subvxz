[dramatic music playing]

01:02.980 --> 01:04.522
[Shiro]
<i>We've gotta act fast.</i>

01:04.605 --> 01:06.733
<i>The power will only be down</i>
<i>for 20 minutes.</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:10.279
The Blade of Marmora's schematics
showed four targets we need to hit.

01:10.362 --> 01:14.449
The weapons systems, the engines,
the bridge, and the shield generators.

01:14.575 --> 01:18.453
Now, let's put an end to Zarkon,
once and for all.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.621
[all]
Yeah!

01:20.372 --> 01:21.790
Form sword!

01:29.506 --> 01:32.884
[Zarkon] I want weapons systems
activated immediately!

01:32.968 --> 01:36.430
Restart the entire crystal core manually
if you have to!

01:45.731 --> 01:48.734
Our ship may be without power,
but we are not.

01:48.817 --> 01:52.487
I can use the komar to draw
the quintessence directly from Voltron,

01:52.571 --> 01:54.448
rendering him lifeless.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.535
It is time I face Voltron myself.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.830
No, lord! It is certain death!

02:01.913 --> 02:04.625
Today, the Black Lion will be mine.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.836
Your obsession with the Black Lion
is clouding your judgment!

02:07.919 --> 02:09.588
You must not go out there!

02:11.965 --> 02:15.093
Hurry! We need to protect our emperor.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.346
[Shiro]
<i>Hit the engine systems!</i>

02:29.524 --> 02:30.651
[grunts]

02:31.526 --> 02:35.739
We've done it.
This is the end of Zarkon's reign.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.324
Yes, Princess.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.581
[alarm blaring]

02:47.834 --> 02:49.920
Ready my armor.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.465
But, lord, it has never been
successfully tested.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.593
To do--
[screams, groans]

03:22.536 --> 03:24.579
Begin the ritual!

03:44.725 --> 03:47.644
[Shiro] <i>Stay focused.</i>
<i>We've neutralized the engines.</i>

03:47.728 --> 03:49.479
<i>Let's target the bridge.</i>

03:53.316 --> 03:54.735
Ready...

03:59.281 --> 04:00.657
[Lance]
<i>What is that?</i>

04:04.494 --> 04:06.246
Oh, no.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.081
Attack!

04:13.086 --> 04:14.254
No!

04:19.341 --> 04:21.553
[all screaming]

04:24.181 --> 04:25.432
[moans]

04:25.515 --> 04:29.436
It's pure quintessence!

04:42.783 --> 04:45.160
[breathing heavily]

04:45.243 --> 04:46.453
[sighs]

04:49.831 --> 04:51.958
[Coran]
Paladins! Can you hear me?

04:54.211 --> 04:56.171
[static]

04:56.922 --> 05:00.091
I thought the virus shut down
all of Zarkon's power!

05:00.175 --> 05:02.511
That blast was not
from the ship's weapons.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.181
-It was magic.
-It must have been the komar.

05:06.264 --> 05:11.311
Zarkon has been trying to develop a device
to extract the quintessence from planets.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.729
<i>It appears he succeeded.</i>

05:12.813 --> 05:16.441
[Coran] <i>If it destroys planets,</i>
<i>what did it do to the paladins?</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:32.874
[Allura]
<i>Paladins! Shiro! Can you hear me?</i>

05:34.459 --> 05:35.377
[static]

05:35.460 --> 05:38.463
[Shiro]
<i>Yes, Princess. We're alive.</i>

05:38.547 --> 05:41.716
-Oh, thank the ancients!
-Is Voltron operational?

05:45.262 --> 05:46.638
It's not working.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.267
[grunts]
I can't move my lion.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.018
You've been hit
with some kind of witchcraft

05:52.102 --> 05:54.187
that draws the quintessence out of you.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.689
You need to get out of there!

05:55.772 --> 05:58.358
Another blast like that
and you may not survive!

05:59.192 --> 06:01.027
Wait. What's that?

06:19.379 --> 06:22.215
You must get moving.
Remember your training.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.467
<i>Remember all the battles</i>
<i>you've been through.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:28.305
[grunts]
Voltron's still not responding.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.900
[groaning]

06:40.984 --> 06:43.028
[sighs]
It's Zarkon.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.034
We must buy them more time.
Get us in closer.

06:49.117 --> 06:53.622
-Divert all power to our weapons system.
-What? Princess, we'll be defenseless!

06:53.705 --> 06:55.332
It's the only way.

07:01.630 --> 07:05.342
Listen to me. You are true paladins now.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.845
<i>Connect with your lions,</i>
<i>reach out to each other!</i>

07:09.763 --> 07:12.390
Fight! This cannot end now!

07:22.025 --> 07:23.777
Fire!

07:38.291 --> 07:41.544
[gasps, screams]

07:45.548 --> 07:47.217
Allura!

08:01.439 --> 08:07.904
Everybody, listen. We have to fight.
We have to channel all our energy.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.323
<i>Visualize five becoming one.</i>

08:10.407 --> 08:14.160
<i>We have to focus everything we have</i>
<i>into moving Voltron.</i>

08:14.244 --> 08:16.788
[takes deep breath]

08:19.082 --> 08:25.296
<i>We are the last thing standing in the way</i>
<i>of Zarkon's total universal domination.</i>

08:25.380 --> 08:27.882
I'm not giving up that fight!

08:27.966 --> 08:29.384
<i>-Are you, Hunk?</i>
-No.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.678
[roars]

08:31.761 --> 08:33.263
<i>-Pidge?</i>
-Never!

08:33.346 --> 08:35.515
[roars]

08:35.597 --> 08:37.851
<i>-Lance?</i>
-Let's go down swingin'.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.102
[roars]

08:40.186 --> 08:42.272
<i>-Keith?</i>
-I'm all in.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.524
[roars]

08:58.955 --> 09:01.458
Then let's get Voltron
back in this battle.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.382
Now, I will take back what is mine!

09:33.448 --> 09:38.453
Summon the energy again!
We must fight beside our emperor!

09:47.462 --> 09:49.506
[Shiro] <i>All right,</i>
<i>let's hit him with the big guns.</i>

09:49.589 --> 09:51.549
<i>Hunk, form shoulder cannon!</i>

09:57.806 --> 09:59.057
<i>Fire!</i>

10:07.148 --> 10:10.151
Attack!

10:12.570 --> 10:13.571
[Shiro]
<i>Look out!</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:15.448
[all scream]

10:19.661 --> 10:20.620
Oh...

10:21.538 --> 10:23.206
Huh?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.958
Princess!
[grunts]

10:25.041 --> 10:27.001
Are you all right, Princess?

10:28.044 --> 10:29.504
[sighs]

10:29.587 --> 10:32.507
I'm fine. How badly
is the Castle damaged?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.385
[alarm blaring]

10:35.468 --> 10:38.471
Our power levels are decimated.
Communications aren't working.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.600
We can't reach the paladins.
I'm afraid we can't fight anymore.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.269
We cannot give up.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.147
[grunting]

10:47.230 --> 10:48.273
Did we win yet?

10:49.149 --> 10:53.194
Coran, you and Slav do what you can
to get the Castle functioning again.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.114
Kolivan, can you get me to the komar?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.701
It will be dangerous, but I know a way.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.579
-You and Antok come with me.
-[both grunt]

11:02.662 --> 11:06.082
We're going to have to attack the witch
directly if we hope to stop that thing.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.293
Coran, the bridge is yours.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.171
No! You've been weakened
by operating the teludav.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.924
-You can't face Haggar directly!
-We don't have a choice.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.418
We've never faced anything
this powerful before.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.963
One way or another,
this may be our last battle.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.842
We've got to give everything we have.
Dig deep and fight!

12:02.889 --> 12:03.723
[beeps]

12:34.462 --> 12:35.505

12:50.353 --> 12:52.522
[growling]
Attack!

13:11.416 --> 13:16.546
This is my time to reclaim the Black Lion.
Nothing can stop me.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.715
[grunting]

13:18.798 --> 13:22.468
He's trying to control my lion.
I can feel him in my mind.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.012
Fight it, Shiro!

13:28.433 --> 13:30.643
[all yelling]

13:43.865 --> 13:45.450
[all screaming]

13:53.041 --> 13:56.461
You should have fled
like your predecessors.

13:56.544 --> 14:00.506
Now, the time of the Voltron Paladins
is finished.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.676
[Keith]
<i>Shiro!</i>

14:04.427 --> 14:05.428
<i>Shiro!</i>

14:06.596 --> 14:08.598
Something's wrong with Shiro.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.560
Guys, we can't let Zarkon
get the Black Lion.
