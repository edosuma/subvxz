WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:04.396
<i>He was my friend.
He gave us this cathedral.</i>

00:04.464 --> 00:06.431
It seems impossible
that he is gone.

00:06.499 --> 00:07.599
I want to replace him.

00:07.667 --> 00:09.835
<i>My world
went up in flames.</i>

00:09.903 --> 00:11.870
We are poor again, Richard.

00:11.938 --> 00:14.106
I've come to ask
for your hand in marriage.

00:14.173 --> 00:17.809
I'll support Richard and
his quest for the earldom.

00:17.877 --> 00:19.645
No! You will not take her!

00:19.712 --> 00:21.713
Aliena! Aliena!

00:21.781 --> 00:24.249
<i>I curse this marriage
with impotence.</i>

00:24.317 --> 00:27.986
I have been asked
to commit a murder.

00:28.054 --> 00:29.788
Oh!

00:29.856 --> 00:32.290
I announce the consummation
of William Hamleigh

00:32.357 --> 00:33.625
as Earl of Shiring.

00:36.696 --> 00:38.897
You slept with Jack Jackson!

00:38.965 --> 00:41.900
It was the only
true good thing I have done.

00:41.968 --> 00:44.403
The original relic was
destroyed in the fire.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.138
Your cathedral is done for.

02:48.928 --> 02:50.395
Uh, not... nothing, sir.

02:52.231 --> 02:54.332
<i>- Oh, you're an Englishman.
- Ouais.</i>

02:54.400 --> 02:55.567
Get back to work.

03:00.673 --> 03:03.542
Abbot Suger, forgive me.

03:03.609 --> 03:06.078
I... I want
to learn here.

03:12.618 --> 03:16.688
The walls are so high,
how do they bear their weight?

03:19.592 --> 03:22.761
You know Euclid,
the father of geometry?

03:22.829 --> 03:25.063
<i>No, non.</i>

03:25.131 --> 03:26.765
Then you know nothing.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.025
<i>Non.</i>

05:12.438 --> 05:13.572
Yes, Prior?

05:13.639 --> 05:15.640
You have a visitor.

05:24.383 --> 05:26.151
You look lost.

05:26.219 --> 05:28.887
Of course, you are.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.989
No longer prior,
your dream demolished,

05:31.057 --> 05:33.325
you must sometimes think
God is punishing you

05:33.392 --> 05:35.293
for your sins,
your willful pride.

05:35.361 --> 05:36.361
Yes.

05:39.265 --> 05:42.534
But perhaps he's guiding you
in another direction:

05:42.602 --> 05:43.602
towards me.

05:46.439 --> 05:50.141
I admire you, Philip,
in spite of what you think.

05:50.209 --> 05:53.879
You're a clever man,
determined and a good priest.

05:53.946 --> 05:56.314
I want to make you
my archdeacon.

05:56.382 --> 05:57.515
Your Eminence.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.384
Hear me out.

05:59.452 --> 06:01.853
In recompense for
not naming me archbishop,

06:01.921 --> 06:05.457
the king has agreed to send me
as his representative to Rome.

06:05.524 --> 06:07.125
And I'll need a trustworthy man

06:07.193 --> 06:09.527
to handle diocesan affairs
in my absences.

06:09.595 --> 06:11.830
And you were the first,
and to be frank,

06:11.898 --> 06:13.832
the only man I could think of.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.567
I... I don't think I'm...

06:15.635 --> 06:17.569
I'm not finished.

06:30.283 --> 06:34.052
When I advance as...

06:35.221 --> 06:37.289
I hope one day to do...

06:38.524 --> 06:40.058
perhaps you will take my place.

06:40.126 --> 06:43.228
As Bishop of Kingsbridge,
you could build your cathedral,

06:43.296 --> 06:45.597
punish the Hamleighs,
do whatever you want.

06:45.665 --> 06:48.466
Until then, I simply ask
for honest diligence

06:48.534 --> 06:51.036
and obedience in all things.

06:51.103 --> 06:52.437
In all good things.

06:52.505 --> 06:53.505
Of course.

06:54.774 --> 06:56.741
I don't need
your answer tonight,

06:56.809 --> 07:00.545
but I will need you living
within my palace in 2 weeks.

07:00.613 --> 07:03.815
Prior Remigius will
reluctantly give you leave.

07:06.819 --> 07:09.621
I look forward to our
partnership, Philip.

07:09.689 --> 07:13.091
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii</i>

07:13.159 --> 07:15.293
<i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

07:47.526 --> 07:49.394
The mouth is too small.

08:23.095 --> 08:24.362
Aliena!

08:32.371 --> 08:34.506
Is it really you?

08:34.573 --> 08:36.474
Yes.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.410
I followed your work.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.080
You left Alfred?

08:51.057 --> 08:52.924
He's mine?

08:58.397 --> 09:00.098
He's mine.

09:05.404 --> 09:07.238
He won't break.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.347
Aliena, he's beautiful.

09:19.151 --> 09:20.985
What's his name?

09:21.053 --> 09:23.188
I haven't chosen one yet.

09:24.256 --> 09:26.157
Shall we call him Jack?

09:26.225 --> 09:28.326
No, no.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.863
No, Jack's the father
I never knew.

09:31.931 --> 09:35.700
Let's name him
after the father I did know.

09:36.735 --> 09:38.536
Tom.

09:38.604 --> 09:39.537
Tom.

09:59.925 --> 10:03.194
Tom dreamed of light,
of churches filled with light,

10:03.262 --> 10:05.530
but he didn't know
how to build them.

10:05.598 --> 10:08.299
And now I know, not only
that it's possible,

10:08.367 --> 10:10.735
but how it can be done.

10:12.805 --> 10:14.139
How's Ma?

10:14.206 --> 10:16.341
She misses you.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.643
And Prior Philip, how's he?

10:18.711 --> 10:20.945
Philip isn't prior anymore.

10:21.013 --> 10:22.180
What?

10:22.248 --> 10:25.350
There was a terrible accident.
The vault fell in.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.718
Alfred's vault fell?

10:26.785 --> 10:28.920
The vault that
Philip sanctioned.

10:28.988 --> 10:31.055
Waleran called for
another election,

10:31.123 --> 10:33.024
and now Remigius is prior.

10:33.092 --> 10:36.294
Philip... Philip
isn't Philip.

10:36.362 --> 10:38.696
<i>He's lost his spirit.</i>

10:38.764 --> 10:42.066
<i>The construction stopped
when the relic was crushed.</i>

10:42.134 --> 10:44.969
<i>Waleran says that, without
a relic to perform miracles,</i>

10:45.037 --> 10:46.304
<i>there can be
no pilgrims.</i>

10:46.372 --> 10:49.541
And without pilgrims,
there can be no church.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.734
We're going home.

11:38.991 --> 11:42.193
We've got just enough.
We travel tomorrow.

11:44.597 --> 11:46.130
No, don't let him move.

11:46.198 --> 11:49.033
He can't not move.
He's a baby.

12:12.224 --> 12:14.592
Jacques Cherbourg?

12:14.660 --> 12:16.694
Of course.
This is Cherbourg.

12:26.905 --> 12:29.440
Jacques.

12:29.508 --> 12:31.709
Your father was my only son.

12:31.777 --> 12:34.012
He was a...

12:34.079 --> 12:36.948
A storyteller and singer
and my close friend.

12:37.016 --> 12:39.384
He taught me French
when I first came here,

12:39.451 --> 12:40.818
and I taught him English.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.755
The prince, King Henry's son,

12:43.822 --> 12:46.291
hired him to sail
with him across the Channel.

12:46.358 --> 12:47.458
Prince William?

12:47.526 --> 12:49.560
Your father called him
the Phoenix Prince

12:49.628 --> 12:51.062
because of a ring he wore.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.364
Was it a signet ring?

12:53.432 --> 12:57.068
Cut in the shape
of a bird rising from fire.

12:57.136 --> 12:59.937
<i>Prince William was
accompanied by his wife</i>

13:00.005 --> 13:03.441
<i>and many people of his court,
including your father.</i>

13:03.509 --> 13:05.810
<i>And they were
never seen again.</i>

13:07.179 --> 13:08.980
<i>That was the White Ship,</i>

13:09.048 --> 13:12.684
the ship that sunk with Prince
William, King Henry's heir.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.253
I thought no one
survived that sinking.

13:15.321 --> 13:18.623
My father survived it.
He was on that ship.

13:27.399 --> 13:29.233
Brother Philip.

13:30.235 --> 13:31.803
Welcome, I'm glad to see

13:31.870 --> 13:34.372
that you have come
to a happy decision.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.009
Yes, yes I have, Eminence.
May we have a word alone?

13:38.077 --> 13:39.410
Oh!

13:41.413 --> 13:44.315
Your offer took me unawares.
And you were right.

13:44.383 --> 13:47.552
I've never... I've never
felt so lost.

13:47.619 --> 13:51.089
Satan tempted Christ
at his weakest:

13:51.156 --> 13:53.791
after 40 days
without food or water.

13:53.859 --> 13:58.463
I haven't Christ's strength
to resist, Eminence, but...

14:00.432 --> 14:01.933
but you...

14:03.769 --> 14:06.504
you do not have
Satan's cunning.

14:08.207 --> 14:10.775
You have taught me, you see.

14:10.843 --> 14:13.778
Politics may be
a bargain between beggars,

14:13.846 --> 14:16.714
but compromise between good
and evil is never possible.

14:18.083 --> 14:22.720
God's work does not
blend with power or greed.

14:22.788 --> 14:26.657
Your moral mortar

14:26.725 --> 14:28.526
is corrupt.

14:28.594 --> 14:30.862
And the walls of
your church will crumble,

14:30.929 --> 14:32.130
and the roof will fall.

14:32.197 --> 14:34.732
And you and everyone
who worships with you

14:34.800 --> 14:35.867
will be crushed.

14:35.934 --> 14:38.803
I would sooner live out
the rest of my days

14:38.871 --> 14:40.805
feeding pigs at the monastery

14:40.873 --> 14:44.342
than feeding your
ravenous ambition.

14:49.915 --> 14:51.983
You're damned.

15:18.811 --> 15:19.777
Hyah!

15:23.182 --> 15:24.816
Yah!

15:31.089 --> 15:32.991
Robert of Gloucester!

15:33.059 --> 15:34.526
Richard of Kingsbridge!

15:34.594 --> 15:37.496
I thought you were a knight,
not a foot soldier!

15:37.564 --> 15:41.867
A poor knight, My Lord,
but soon I'll be a wealthy one!

15:48.141 --> 15:50.876
Yah! Yah!

16:05.692 --> 16:08.126
In the name of Queen Maud...

16:09.128 --> 16:10.762
I ask you for mercy.

16:13.566 --> 16:16.535
Then God grant you peace.

16:16.603 --> 16:18.303
Yeah!

16:18.371 --> 16:20.138
Yeah!

16:20.206 --> 16:22.941
Yeah! Yeah!

16:24.143 --> 16:25.644
Yeah!

16:25.712 --> 16:27.646
Yeah!

16:30.014 --> 16:31.214
Good man!

16:45.129 --> 16:47.363
I am not yet defeated.

16:48.566 --> 16:50.834
I still have you, Henry.

16:50.901 --> 16:55.371
Gloucester was my muscle,
but you, you are my heart.

16:55.439 --> 16:58.875
And I swear upon
his butchered body...

16:59.910 --> 17:01.511
one day, you will be king.

17:08.085 --> 17:10.185
God told me this would happen.

17:10.253 --> 17:11.820
In a dream, Your Majesty?

17:11.888 --> 17:15.224
Heavens, no. He told me
over dinner last night.

17:15.291 --> 17:18.828
You have my undying gratitude.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.896
Thank you, Your Majesty.

17:23.267 --> 17:24.733
I humbly ask...

17:24.801 --> 17:27.103
I have no title to give you.

17:28.539 --> 17:32.075
Yet there's to be a crusade,
and I need volunteers.

17:32.142 --> 17:35.144
I'll give you horse and armor
and a squire or two

17:35.212 --> 17:36.757
if you kill
some Saracens for me.

17:37.679 --> 17:41.814
When you return, we'll see what
we can do about your father's title.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.036
As you wish, Your Majesty.

17:45.338 --> 17:49.262
You see, Eustaces,
Maud's bastard brother is dead.

17:50.239 --> 17:53.654
He was her strength.
She's defeated now.

17:53.774 --> 17:56.786
And I swear
on his traitorous head,

17:56.906 --> 17:59.572
one day, you will be king.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.434
The workers are gone.

18:18.502 --> 18:20.554
Nothing's been done
since the collapse.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.466
What is it, brother?

19:23.534 --> 19:24.660
Is something wrong?

19:24.780 --> 19:26.492
It's Jack!
He's come home!

19:33.978 --> 19:36.012
Hey! Jack Jackson's home!

19:37.011 --> 19:38.231
He's in the cathedral!

20:03.186 --> 20:04.664
Welcome home, Jack.

20:06.777 --> 20:10.243
Last time we saw you, you were
locked away in our dungeon.

20:10.726 --> 20:12.742
Have you returned to serve out
the rest of your sentence?

20:13.032 --> 20:15.673
I was locked up
to keep me away from Aliena.

20:16.353 --> 20:17.954
It's too late for that now.

20:31.987 --> 20:33.396
I was wrong.

20:35.797 --> 20:39.208
As I recall,
my predecessor forbade you

20:39.328 --> 20:42.345
from stepping foot on these
holy grounds except as a monk.

20:42.413 --> 20:45.848
You're consorting
with a married woman

20:45.916 --> 20:47.884
and living in sin.

20:47.951 --> 20:53.022
You must either leave
the whore or leave Kingsbridge.

20:55.159 --> 20:57.560
I've come to finish
the cathedral.

20:57.628 --> 20:59.896
The cathedral is dead, Jack.

20:59.963 --> 21:02.565
There are no more relics,
miracles or pilgrims.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.367
Which is why
I bring you this...

21:06.203 --> 21:08.738
a miraculous statue,
a holy relic from France.

21:08.806 --> 21:11.808
We've heard about
these fake relics

21:11.875 --> 21:14.677
traveling from
village to village,

21:14.745 --> 21:18.081
supposedly curing the sick.

21:20.084 --> 21:23.653
However, there's always
a charlatan behind it.

21:51.415 --> 21:54.250
She weeps
for the world's ambitions.

21:55.719 --> 22:00.289
<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena</i>

22:01.478 --> 22:02.831
<i>Dominus tecum...</i>

22:03.694 --> 22:07.363
<i>benedicta tu in mulieribus,</i>

22:07.431 --> 22:11.634
<i>et benedictus fructus
ventris tui Iesus.</i>

22:16.184 --> 22:19.830
It's a trick, Your Eminence,
but I don't know how he does it.

22:19.950 --> 22:21.294
Where did he get it?

22:21.414 --> 22:23.694
He made it himself,
it's obvious.

22:23.814 --> 22:25.681
Rumor has it, it's carved
from the true cross,

22:25.749 --> 22:27.714
but it's far too new for that.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.840
And the miracles,
are they real?

22:29.960 --> 22:31.028
Who's to say?

22:31.148 --> 22:33.702
Cripples walk,
the dying are revived,

22:33.979 --> 22:35.553
but witchcraft does the same.

22:35.673 --> 22:36.920
One thing is certain.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.963
More and more pilgrims
come every day

22:39.083 --> 22:40.823
giving money for the cathedral.

22:41.058 --> 22:43.399
That's the greatest
miracle of all.

22:49.206 --> 22:50.206
Ma!

22:53.605 --> 22:54.872
Ma!

22:54.992 --> 22:56.607
My boy!

22:56.675 --> 22:59.107
Oh, I missed you!
I missed you so much!

22:59.227 --> 23:00.144
I missed you, too.

23:02.158 --> 23:03.414
You're thinner than ever.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.384
You look exactly the same.

23:06.451 --> 23:09.920
You're a father now. You have
to take care of yourself.

23:12.546 --> 23:13.858
We named him Tom.

23:15.326 --> 23:16.293
Give him here.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.131
He looks like he eats well.

23:20.198 --> 23:21.265
And constantly.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.436
How is married life?

23:25.504 --> 23:28.272
We're not married yet,
not in the eyes of the Church.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.294
Why should you care
what the Church says?

23:30.414 --> 23:32.434
I'm gonna ask Alfred
for an annulment.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.578
He'll never give it.

23:34.646 --> 23:35.713
Come.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.982
I intend to rebuild
the cathedral, Ma,

23:38.049 --> 23:40.651
but they won't hire
a man who's living in sin.

23:41.887 --> 23:44.488
That would eliminate
everyone in their eyes.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.259
Ma, I met my father's family.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.365
Somehow, Father got that ring.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.635
And it must've been a sign that
he intended to give the king,

23:57.702 --> 24:00.104
but they silenced him
before that could happen.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.405
A sign of what?

24:01.473 --> 24:04.175
That he was there, Ma,
that he knew the prince

24:04.242 --> 24:07.478
or that the prince told him
something or he saw something,

24:07.546 --> 24:10.514
something that cost
him his life, Ma.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.316
Who were the other two?

24:13.852 --> 24:15.286
What other two?

24:15.353 --> 24:17.855
The men that condemned
Father. Who were they?

24:29.668 --> 24:33.070
I curse you, all three of you.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.841
Your church, dear prior,
shall burn to the ground.

24:39.244 --> 24:44.014
Prior James was one, the prior
of Kingsbridge before Philip.

24:47.586 --> 24:51.689
Your children, My Lord,
shall die on the gallows.

24:51.756 --> 24:53.524
Who is the lord?

24:54.526 --> 24:56.293
He's dead.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.762
There's nothing you
can do to him anymore.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.466
Lord Percy.

25:03.702 --> 25:06.136
<i>Percy Hamleigh.</i>

25:10.575 --> 25:14.245
And the priest?
The one you confessed to.

25:19.951 --> 25:24.188
And you, good father,
the confessor whom I trusted,

25:24.256 --> 25:27.791
you shall one day climb
very high, only to fall.

25:33.064 --> 25:34.899
Waleran.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.539
I told him that I'd
found a man on the beach.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.841
He needs your help,
your support.

25:43.909 --> 25:47.278
He has a secret he will
tell no one but the king.

25:47.345 --> 25:51.248
<i>They framed you father for
stealing the priory chalice.</i>

25:51.316 --> 25:53.250
And eventually,
they burned him.

25:54.819 --> 25:57.621
And he never
told you his secret?

25:57.689 --> 25:59.123
No.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.691
But they knew.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.028
How?

26:20.946 --> 26:23.247
God hear thee, mother.

26:38.463 --> 26:41.198
Your Eminence, welcome.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.035
Make way for the bishop.

26:47.005 --> 26:51.775
Your Eminence, I... I need
to speak to you about my sister.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.414
Holy Mary,
mother of God!

27:30.482 --> 27:32.049
Tears of Mary!

27:32.117 --> 27:33.684
It's beautiful!

27:39.324 --> 27:41.992
Holy Mary! Please!

27:42.060 --> 27:44.094
Please help!

27:44.162 --> 27:46.597
Save me, o blessed virgin!

27:52.537 --> 27:54.972
Help me!

27:55.040 --> 27:58.676
Help me!
Please help me!

28:17.800 --> 28:19.209
Can I come in?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.718
- - Are you alone?
- - Yes.

28:36.757 --> 28:40.350
I didn't do it
to hurt you, Alfred.

28:41.352 --> 28:44.135
I'm here to ask you,
on behalf of Aliena,

28:44.494 --> 28:46.096
to apply for an annulment.

28:46.413 --> 28:47.380
Why should I?

28:47.500 --> 28:49.586
You won't be able to
marry again without it.

28:49.848 --> 28:52.696
You'll have a wife
who won't live with you,

28:52.764 --> 28:55.666
who fathered a child
with another man.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.121
And that's how you'll be known.

28:57.241 --> 28:59.358
I got rid of her.
I told her to leave.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.899
I don't want her back,
you can be sure of that.

29:02.019 --> 29:03.529
- Yes.
- The house is mine.

29:03.888 --> 29:06.176
When I married her,
it passed to me.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.444
Of course.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.148
And I want money.

29:11.478 --> 29:12.762
It'll cost you.

29:13.094 --> 29:14.985
Well, I have no money now,

29:15.053 --> 29:18.122
but if the church building
continues, I will soon enough.

29:18.189 --> 29:20.624
And I can give you work,
too, if you need it.

29:20.692 --> 29:21.859
They won't allow it.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.695
No one trusts me to
build for them anymore.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.197
Well, damn them! I built
that vault strong enough!

29:27.265 --> 29:30.211
I supported it well.
It wasn't my fault! I was cursed.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.269
Alfred...

29:32.337 --> 29:33.837
I loved her!

29:36.081 --> 29:37.462
You knew that.

29:37.918 --> 29:40.141
From the first moment
I saw her, I loved her.

29:41.232 --> 29:42.993
Now I'm a laughingstock.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.016
You took my da from me.

29:46.084 --> 29:49.520
You killed my ma. Your witch
of a mother poisoned her.

29:49.587 --> 29:50.888
Your ma died in childbirth.

29:50.955 --> 29:51.786
She poisoned her!

29:53.186 --> 29:55.526
And then she cursed me.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.228
She made me soft...

29:58.766 --> 29:59.746
down here.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.905
Everyone heard. And when they
saw the baby, everyone knew!

30:03.025 --> 30:05.278
- She doesn't have those powers.
- She collapsed the vault!

30:05.303 --> 30:06.882
She took my work from me!

30:07.357 --> 30:09.062
You took my wife!

30:09.849 --> 30:13.090
Everything I've ever had
or wanted, you've stolen!

30:13.210 --> 30:16.639
- You took something, too.
- What? What did I ever take?

30:16.759 --> 30:20.158
My ring. You took
my da's ring.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.556
And I want it back.

30:26.276 --> 30:30.160
If I had it,
I would melt it into a lump

30:30.228 --> 30:33.030
and piss on it.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.935
Get out.

30:50.281 --> 30:53.350
We know you wish
Jack Jackson dead.

30:53.418 --> 30:55.953
If only wishes had knives.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.088
Dear lady, I think
you miss my point.

30:58.581 --> 31:01.458
Because of Jackson's
miraculous statue,

31:01.526 --> 31:03.660
there are now pilgrims
in Kingsbridge.

31:03.728 --> 31:06.064
And where there are
pilgrims, there is a market.

31:06.184 --> 31:07.664
They have a license.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.533
They haven't had a turnout

31:09.601 --> 31:12.936
simply because your son
burned the fleece fair.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.205
That was your idea.

31:15.273 --> 31:18.375
Is that an accusation
or a compliment?

31:18.443 --> 31:20.444
There will be a new market,

31:20.511 --> 31:24.357
and I expect there will be
a newer, grander fleece fair.

31:24.592 --> 31:27.984
Shiring will once again get
the sharp end of the stick.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.390
Could I be clearer
than this, hmm?

31:33.458 --> 31:35.869
We are, for better
or worse, together in this.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.662
Then let's kill him.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.468
And Aliena.
They're living in sin.

31:44.535 --> 31:48.724
They deserve to die, and
that bastard child of theirs.

31:48.844 --> 31:50.506
And how do you plan to do this?

31:50.626 --> 31:52.370
We could slip him some poison.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.829
Mother's a witch.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.280
An assassin perhaps.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.849
Assassins can be
caught and tortured.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.484
Another attack on Kingsbridge.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.619
He may run away, he may hide.

32:02.687 --> 32:06.323
With our luck, he'll probably
be visiting his mother.

32:06.391 --> 32:08.292
Why not combine all three?

32:08.359 --> 32:12.110
William won't attack until we're certain
Jack is present, I can see to that.

32:12.230 --> 32:16.433
You once said you had
a spy or two at the priory.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.935
In the midst of battle,

32:18.002 --> 32:21.238
your spy will stab Jack
with a dagger dipped in poison.

32:21.306 --> 32:25.108
Who's to say he didn't
die defending his church?

32:25.176 --> 32:28.312
There's the
added bonus of course

32:28.379 --> 32:30.747
of destroying Kingsbridge.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.416
What do you think?

32:32.483 --> 32:34.685
Oh, leave it to Eve every time.

32:34.752 --> 32:38.889
First, I must make
a pilgrimage to Kingsbridge

32:38.957 --> 32:40.958
to make sure Jack's at home.

32:41.025 --> 32:44.261
And besides, I'm curious
to see the Madonna.

32:44.329 --> 32:48.332
Give me your spy's name.
I'll talk to him.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.844
Blessed be God forever.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.513
Blessed be God in his angels
and in his saints.

33:03.581 --> 33:07.150
Blessed be
God forever. Amen.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.024
Father, I need to confess.

33:14.092 --> 33:17.561
Tomorrow morning,
my child, uh, before mass.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.767
No, Father, now.

33:24.769 --> 33:25.836
Don't be afraid.

33:25.903 --> 33:28.405
I can't imagine any sin
you've committed

33:28.473 --> 33:30.107
is as terrible as you fear.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.109
It's not a sin, Father.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.343
What do you mean?

33:33.411 --> 33:35.465
It's not a sin
I need to tell you.

33:35.585 --> 33:37.714
My husband, William...

33:37.782 --> 33:38.715
Yes?

33:38.783 --> 33:40.717
He's going
to attack Kingsbridge

33:40.785 --> 33:42.953
in 2 days' time
with an army of men.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.723
Dear God, why?

33:46.791 --> 33:48.558
They want to kill
someone named Jack.

33:48.626 --> 33:51.194
There's a spy who's
going to assassinate him

33:51.262 --> 33:52.195
during the attack.

33:52.263 --> 33:53.730
Did they say who?

33:53.798 --> 33:54.798
No.

34:04.197 --> 34:07.842
It's Remigius. He's
always been Waleran's ally.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.032
I'll have to try and find
some way to lock him up.

34:13.850 --> 34:16.386
I'd rather catch
him in the act.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.489
How can we defend
ourselves against William?

34:20.558 --> 34:23.560
I haven't a clue, but
Aliena has a visitor who does.

34:25.545 --> 34:27.621
We meet him in the field
outside of town.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.059
There are hundreds of us.
He'll bring twenty at most.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.330
Monks don't fight.

34:31.449 --> 34:33.351
I can't ask the townspeople
to give their lives

34:33.378 --> 34:35.027
when I won't risk my own.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.819
Maybe they'll run
when they see us.

34:36.886 --> 34:38.420
And maybe they won't.

34:38.487 --> 34:41.422
Is there any way to
avoid a pitched battle?

34:41.491 --> 34:43.192
Not without town walls.

34:43.259 --> 34:44.193
Walls would do it?

34:44.260 --> 34:46.027
Yes, but we can't
build them in time.

34:46.096 --> 34:48.731
They're easy to build.
We have the men and materials.

34:48.797 --> 34:51.065
There's not enough stone
to wall in the town.

34:51.134 --> 34:52.634
Well, does it have to be stone?

34:52.702 --> 34:54.469
A ditch with
a rampart would work.

34:54.536 --> 34:56.347
But that wouldn't
hold them back for long.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.537
Long enough. They'd
be stopped, exposed.

34:58.657 --> 35:01.108
And when they're vulnerable,
we can shoot stones, arrows...

35:01.745 --> 35:04.868
Can you build
a town wall in 2 days?

35:04.906 --> 35:07.270
Well, I've never built
a town wall in my life,

35:07.390 --> 35:09.341
so it'll be the worst-built
wall in England,

35:09.461 --> 35:10.736
but I... I think so, yeah.

35:10.856 --> 35:12.955
Well, what if it
doesn't hold them back?

35:13.022 --> 35:15.290
Wouldn't it be safer
to run to the forest

35:15.358 --> 35:16.759
and trust William won't follow?

35:16.826 --> 35:18.327
It's not a question of safety.

35:18.395 --> 35:20.929
If we run, we lose everything
that we've worked for:

35:20.997 --> 35:23.265
the priory, the cathedral.

35:23.333 --> 35:26.402
And I have a special reason to
see William Hamleigh defeated.

35:42.485 --> 35:44.386
Come on, you two!

35:44.454 --> 35:46.588
Attention!

35:49.392 --> 35:52.094
One, two, three.

35:52.162 --> 35:53.662
Hyah!

35:58.835 --> 36:00.102
Hyah!

36:00.170 --> 36:02.004
Come on, men!
Keep it up!

36:02.071 --> 36:04.573
This wall needs
to go up faster!

36:04.641 --> 36:06.442
And pull!

36:09.813 --> 36:11.447
Keep it up!

36:13.450 --> 36:14.950
Thank you.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.454
That's enough!

36:25.528 --> 36:28.096
Shore 'er up!!
Shore 'er up!

36:31.835 --> 36:32.768
Ma!

36:32.836 --> 36:34.136
Aliena sent word.

36:34.204 --> 36:36.638
I want to help.
Put me to work.

36:51.254 --> 36:54.156
Tomorrow morning,
when we attack Kingsbridge,

36:54.224 --> 36:57.659
don't forget that
destruction, My Lord...

36:58.661 --> 37:01.330
is the work of angels,

37:01.397 --> 37:03.932
albeit the dark ones.

37:18.481 --> 37:20.716
Where are you?

37:22.652 --> 37:25.053
I want to fuck you.

37:44.874 --> 37:47.843
Up higher. That's it.

37:47.911 --> 37:48.977
Pick a pole.

37:49.045 --> 37:51.280
Throw it away!

37:51.347 --> 37:52.314
Watch out.

37:52.382 --> 37:53.649
There you go.

37:53.716 --> 37:55.183
Leave it alone.

37:55.251 --> 37:56.518
Take it away.

37:56.586 --> 37:57.586
Left, right.

37:57.654 --> 37:59.555
It goes over there.

38:05.161 --> 38:06.662
Another way clear.

38:06.729 --> 38:07.663
Together!

38:07.730 --> 38:08.864
Are you ready?

38:08.932 --> 38:10.098
Ready!

38:13.269 --> 38:14.803
Are we gonna finish in time?

38:14.871 --> 38:15.804
At this rate, no.

38:15.872 --> 38:17.739
What can we do
to speed things up?

38:17.807 --> 38:19.675
We need to build
faster and worse.

38:19.742 --> 38:21.043
Well then, let's do it!

38:30.286 --> 38:33.121
It's my fault
you rest in unholy ground.

38:33.189 --> 38:35.457
I should go to hell,
Kate, not you.

39:00.316 --> 39:02.551
I love you.

39:12.795 --> 39:14.997
Hyah! Hyah, hyah!

39:35.027 --> 39:37.085
Ride toward me. Arrest
everyone over there.

41:01.904 --> 41:03.338
Now!

41:13.616 --> 41:14.883
Yah!

41:51.587 --> 41:52.888
Yah!

41:58.394 --> 41:59.594
Come on!

42:01.464 --> 42:02.864
Yah!

42:38.968 --> 42:42.070
William! Come!

43:08.931 --> 43:10.432
Ah!

43:13.169 --> 43:15.937
My Lord? My Lord!

43:16.939 --> 43:19.441
Retreat!

43:19.508 --> 43:21.276
Retreat!

43:40.363 --> 43:42.931
Yeah!

43:42.999 --> 43:45.200
Yeah!

43:45.268 --> 43:48.136
Yeah! Yay!

43:49.138 --> 43:50.438
Hyah! Hyah!

44:42.992 --> 44:46.061
Jack! Where is Jack?

44:47.563 --> 44:49.764
We're saved!
We are saved!

44:49.832 --> 44:51.866
We did it!

44:51.934 --> 44:55.837
It was the wall that
did it, Jack, your wall.

45:14.991 --> 45:16.992
What's this?
What's this? What's this?

45:17.059 --> 45:20.228
My... my sister.

45:21.230 --> 45:23.031
He promised to

45:23.099 --> 45:26.167
rebury her in holy ground.

45:26.235 --> 45:29.137
She'd be saved, Philip.

45:29.205 --> 45:31.473
He forgave me this.

45:33.642 --> 45:35.176
Oh no!

45:35.244 --> 45:36.611
Oh no!

45:36.679 --> 45:39.180
Oh no, no, no!

45:44.020 --> 45:45.420
You told Bishop Waleran

45:45.488 --> 45:47.622
about the weeping lady.

45:47.690 --> 45:50.792
You've done everything
you can to stop the cathedral.

45:50.860 --> 45:53.695
You even knew about the attack
and you didn't tell us.

45:57.967 --> 46:01.770
Did you coerce Cuthbert
into murdering Jack?

46:04.073 --> 46:05.840
His sister was
a woman of the streets

46:05.908 --> 46:09.010
who died on the day she
came here for forgiveness.

46:09.078 --> 46:11.379
The bishop refused
her absolution

46:11.447 --> 46:13.615
and buried her
in unholy ground.

46:13.682 --> 46:15.617
Did you barter her salvation?

46:15.684 --> 46:18.686
That was Bishop Waleran's
doing, not mine.

46:18.754 --> 46:21.756
I told him Cuthbert's a fool,

46:21.824 --> 46:24.159
but he didn't trust me.

46:24.226 --> 46:27.495
We don't want you prior
no more. We want Philip back.

46:27.563 --> 46:30.065
Aye! Aye!

46:31.067 --> 46:32.534
You idiot!

46:33.569 --> 46:36.071
Twenty men to take a town!

46:36.138 --> 46:37.972
I didn't know they had a wall.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.675
Well, they didn't
as of a few days ago.

46:40.743 --> 46:43.144
Somebody must've talked.
What did you do?

46:43.212 --> 46:46.247
Get drunk and brag to one
of your stupid whores? Oh!

46:46.315 --> 46:50.351
You are as dense as your father,
William, and twice the coward.

46:50.419 --> 46:54.022
A bump on your head
and you turn tail and run!

46:54.090 --> 46:56.491
Once again, it is
up to me to save Shiring.

46:56.559 --> 46:58.026
God knows it'll never be saved

46:58.094 --> 47:00.195
by incompetent
pig slurry like you!

47:00.262 --> 47:01.262
Enough!

47:13.576 --> 47:16.978
Is my sweet William
out of sorts, hmm?

47:18.581 --> 47:21.316
Your mother has a temper,
dear, you know that.

47:23.586 --> 47:27.655
Now tell me. Whom
do you hate the most?

47:29.992 --> 47:31.659
Jack Jackson.

47:31.727 --> 47:34.162
And what would you do to him?

47:34.230 --> 47:35.530
Skin him alive.

47:35.598 --> 47:37.632
And so you shall.

47:39.602 --> 47:41.970
And whom do you love the most?

47:45.474 --> 47:48.543
William, whom do
you love the most?

47:48.611 --> 47:50.011
You.

47:53.449 --> 47:55.550
And what would you do to me?

48:07.997 --> 48:10.231
What the fuck
are you looking at?

48:33.322 --> 48:35.490
Shhh!

48:35.558 --> 48:37.625
Shhh!

48:37.693 --> 48:40.795
Shhh!

49:36.885 --> 49:39.153
What a terrible accident.

49:40.389 --> 49:43.291
Too much wine and
wandering at night.

50:14.790 --> 50:17.025
You betrayed us, brother.

50:17.092 --> 50:19.494
For that, we cast you out.

50:19.561 --> 50:22.764
Take what few belongings
you have and leave.

50:22.831 --> 50:24.732
We'll finish this church
without you.

50:24.800 --> 50:28.403
Oh, you will.
That, you will.

50:28.470 --> 50:30.305
But that church

50:30.372 --> 50:33.741
is for your glory, not God's.

50:33.809 --> 50:36.344
I may be a sinner,
too, but you,

50:36.412 --> 50:39.614
you, Philip, are
no better than Waleran.

50:51.327 --> 50:53.594
It's only words, Prior.

50:53.662 --> 50:55.596
There's truth in them.

51:01.603 --> 51:03.471
Thanks to you,
this town is saved,

51:03.539 --> 51:06.074
and because of you,
we will finish this church.

51:06.141 --> 51:08.876
I want you to be
my master builder, Jack.

51:10.512 --> 51:12.814
I hope I'm ready, Prior.

51:12.881 --> 51:14.716
I know you are.

51:27.129 --> 51:29.931
My fight in the crusade
will get us back our title.

51:33.435 --> 51:38.139
I'll bring back a Saracen's head
from the Holy Land just for you.

51:38.207 --> 51:41.109
Just bring yourself back,
that's all I ask.

51:49.518 --> 51:51.319
Philip in power...

51:52.321 --> 51:53.955
Regan dead,

51:54.022 --> 51:56.257
the cathedral to be finished.

51:56.325 --> 51:59.160
Ever your patient general,
Lord God,

51:59.228 --> 52:01.429
when will I see our victory?

52:02.664 --> 52:05.433
Look what I have done for you.

52:05.501 --> 52:08.536
God, why hast thou forsaken me?

52:21.517 --> 52:22.884
Good morning.

52:24.253 --> 52:27.054
So, now that we've
finished the vault,

52:27.122 --> 52:29.123
we start work on the towers.

52:29.191 --> 52:31.092
It's 2 fingers
pointing to heaven,

52:31.160 --> 52:33.895
but also doubly supporting
the wall of the nave.

52:33.962 --> 52:38.866
Now, our budget is tight,
our time frame even tighter.

52:38.934 --> 52:42.804
So, we must be
swift and diligent.

52:42.871 --> 52:45.106
And there's
no room for error now.

52:45.174 --> 52:48.643
We will finish this church
while peace still reigns.

52:48.710 --> 52:51.312
Another war could
stop us all together.

52:51.380 --> 52:52.847
Now, Matthew...

52:58.153 --> 52:59.754
I'm afraid, Father.

52:59.822 --> 53:04.325
Good God, Eustace! What
can you possibly be afraid of?

53:04.393 --> 53:06.461
I'll make a bad decision.

53:06.528 --> 53:09.096
Kings don't make bad decisions.

53:09.164 --> 53:11.299
Now, your advisers
will advise you.

53:11.366 --> 53:13.100
But, if something goes wrong,

53:13.168 --> 53:15.970
it's their fault for
not informing you fully.

53:16.038 --> 53:17.038
Now sit.

53:18.307 --> 53:20.475
Bring in the petitioner.

53:22.811 --> 53:25.012
Don't fuss about it.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.881
You're only king for a morning.

53:26.949 --> 53:28.816
This is a...
It's a minor issue.

53:28.884 --> 53:32.453
England won't collapse if
you mishandle it. Good boy.

53:34.957 --> 53:37.358
Richard of Kingsbridge,
welcome home.

53:37.426 --> 53:39.627
The crusade went well?

53:39.695 --> 53:42.430
It was a long journey, Your
Majesty, with little result.

53:42.498 --> 53:46.067
You killed a lot
of Jews, didn't you, hmm?

53:46.134 --> 53:48.069
That's what I was told.

53:49.241 --> 53:52.440
I came to believe the Jews were not
necessarily our enemies, My Lord.

53:52.508 --> 53:54.976
Mmm, how odd.

53:55.043 --> 53:57.178
At any rate,
you have a petition.

53:57.246 --> 54:00.014
Prince Eustace here
will hear it.

54:00.082 --> 54:03.117
And whatever
he decides will be law.

54:06.555 --> 54:08.122
My Prince.

54:08.190 --> 54:09.857
Speak freely, Sir Richard.

54:11.860 --> 54:14.228
For many years now,
I have been asking

54:14.296 --> 54:16.797
that my father's title
be restored to me,

54:16.865 --> 54:18.933
along with his castle
and his land.

54:19.001 --> 54:20.768
I've served
the king faithfully,

54:20.836 --> 54:23.638
first against Maud,
now in the Holy Land.

54:23.705 --> 54:26.707
Your title was given to
William Hamleigh, was it not?

54:27.743 --> 54:29.610
Yes, My Lord.

54:30.913 --> 54:32.446
But he's continually
changed sides

54:32.514 --> 54:33.748
in the war of succession,

54:33.815 --> 54:37.151
and in addition, is a bad
landlord with unpaid taxes.

54:38.954 --> 54:42.557
I will pay those taxes and
serve you better than he

54:42.624 --> 54:44.158
once Shiring is mine.

54:46.495 --> 54:48.162
Very well, it's yours.

54:53.502 --> 54:55.403
It's mine, My Lord?

54:55.470 --> 54:59.640
Yes, if...
that's all right, Father?

54:59.708 --> 55:01.776
Whatever you say, Eustace.

55:02.978 --> 55:06.747
There's just one tiny problem.

55:07.749 --> 55:09.984
Cardinal Waleran,

55:10.052 --> 55:12.887
you know Richard of Kingsbridge,
don't you?

55:12.955 --> 55:14.322
Your Eminence.

55:14.389 --> 55:17.458
The cardinal recently
returned from Rome

55:17.526 --> 55:21.095
where he served
His Holiness for nearly 8 years.

55:21.163 --> 55:23.798
Your Eminence is well rewarded
for your service, I see.

55:23.865 --> 55:26.467
What's the problem, Cardinal?

55:26.535 --> 55:28.302
Why can't Richard
be named earl?

55:29.972 --> 55:32.006
In order for him
to claim his title,

55:32.074 --> 55:34.408
he has to take the castle
by force, Majesty.

55:34.476 --> 55:36.944
And it is
well armed, I believe.

55:38.313 --> 55:40.781
So, Richard has to
raise his own army,

55:40.849 --> 55:45.486
and pay and feed
and arm them himself.

55:45.554 --> 55:48.522
Unless Your Majesty
is willing to contribute.

55:48.590 --> 55:50.591
No.

55:52.094 --> 55:54.695
No, that's... that's
impossible.

55:54.763 --> 55:57.031
We're poor as church mice.

56:14.282 --> 56:17.418
Tommy! Tom, you've got
to run it against the wind.

56:17.486 --> 56:18.953
So, take it the other way.

56:19.021 --> 56:21.355
That's good. He's good.
Hand me the basket.

56:21.423 --> 56:22.523
Jack!

56:22.591 --> 56:24.158
What?

56:25.394 --> 56:26.661
Nothing.

56:26.728 --> 56:28.095
Wait, what?
What is it?

56:28.163 --> 56:30.331
No, don't. Stop.

56:34.436 --> 56:36.203
A storm is coming.

56:36.271 --> 56:38.372
I'll go check
the cathedral for cracks.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.574
You should take Tom back
before he gets wet.

56:40.642 --> 56:42.309
God forbid anything
should happen

56:42.377 --> 56:43.711
to your precious cathedral.

56:44.713 --> 56:46.280
What did you say?

56:46.348 --> 56:49.850
I said cathedral first,
family second.

56:49.918 --> 56:51.952
That's not true.

56:52.020 --> 56:52.987
It's my work.

56:53.055 --> 56:54.889
It's your life, Jack.

56:54.956 --> 56:56.257
Not me, not Tommy.

56:56.324 --> 56:58.359
You have your work, Aliena.

56:58.427 --> 57:01.495
Which doesn't compare
to your calling from God.

57:01.563 --> 57:03.964
Prior Philip gives you pittance

57:04.032 --> 57:07.101
for all the hours that you
spend building his church, Jack.

57:07.169 --> 57:08.602
His, not yours.

57:08.670 --> 57:10.404
You're so tired
when you come home,

57:10.472 --> 57:13.040
you have little energy
for anything else but sleep.

57:13.108 --> 57:15.042
I'm treated like
a neglected mistress.

57:15.110 --> 57:16.477
I'm not even your wife!

57:16.545 --> 57:19.113
And you think an afternoon
of kite flying and picnic

57:19.181 --> 57:20.848
is enough to make
everything fine?

57:20.916 --> 57:24.351
You're not my wife because
you chose to marry Alfred.

57:24.419 --> 57:26.687
I begged you not to,

57:26.755 --> 57:28.389
but Richard needed the money.

57:28.457 --> 57:30.624
And that is all that
you care about, isn't it,

57:30.692 --> 57:32.660
is Richard's precious title.

57:32.728 --> 57:35.529
Well, that was your
naive promise, Aliena, not mine.

57:37.532 --> 57:38.666
Face the facts.

57:38.734 --> 57:39.700
Shiring is a dream,

57:39.768 --> 57:41.235
you will never win it back.

57:41.303 --> 57:43.504
Just as you will never
be a princess again,

57:43.572 --> 57:46.273
only the merchant mistress
of a common laborer.

57:46.341 --> 57:47.341
Now take Tom back.

57:57.252 --> 58:00.321
Someone left this
for you, Your Eminence.

58:00.388 --> 58:01.489
Who?

58:01.556 --> 58:03.157
He didn't say.

59:21.102 --> 59:22.770
We'll stop at the inn.

59:25.407 --> 59:27.074
Ma!

01:00:18.093 --> 01:00:20.094
What do you want?

01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:21.662
Money? Food?

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.430
You must help me, witch.

01:00:23.498 --> 01:00:25.799
I can't help you
if you kill me.

01:00:29.871 --> 01:00:32.907
I don't
wanna hurt anybody!

01:00:34.743 --> 01:00:36.577
Remigius!

01:00:40.148 --> 01:00:42.283
I've no one to turn to.

01:00:46.821 --> 01:00:49.657
<i>Whom do you
love the most?</i>

01:00:49.724 --> 01:00:51.458
<i>And what would you do me?</i>

01:00:55.297 --> 01:00:58.232
Mother! No!

01:01:08.543 --> 01:01:10.477
Who did this to you?

01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:11.712
My husband.

01:01:14.816 --> 01:01:16.250
Why?

01:01:16.318 --> 01:01:18.018
He was drunk and angry.

01:01:18.086 --> 01:01:21.121
He does it often,
but this was the worst.

01:01:24.693 --> 01:01:26.226
Who is your husband?

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.664
You needn't fear.

01:01:32.133 --> 01:01:34.668
I will keep you safe.

01:01:37.467 --> 01:01:38.848
William of Shiring.

01:01:40.608 --> 01:01:42.576
Elizabeth?

01:01:51.088 --> 01:01:52.455
I was in love once.

01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:55.923
Love is a terrible thing.

01:01:56.966 --> 01:02:00.661
I know, it struck me dead.

01:02:02.627 --> 01:02:03.829
Did she die?

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:09.603
He hanged himself.
And I found him.

01:02:12.674 --> 01:02:15.142
I was only 13
when he married me.

01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:18.408
The Church forbade
him to touch me

01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:21.648
until I was...
more mature.

01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:24.867
He cared nothing for rules.

01:02:26.693 --> 01:02:28.322
He came to me
on my wedding night,

01:02:29.384 --> 01:02:31.358
and hurt me so badly

01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:34.962
that I was unable,
after that, to bear children.

01:02:37.575 --> 01:02:41.335
I loved him and he loved me.

01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:44.905
How could it be a sin?

01:02:45.902 --> 01:02:49.534
But I confessed,
and my confessor

01:02:49.654 --> 01:02:52.312
made me denounce
him to the others.

01:02:53.156 --> 01:02:58.556
And after he took his life,
my confessor made me fix things

01:02:58.676 --> 01:03:01.782
so that I would never
be able to sin like that again.

01:03:03.218 --> 01:03:04.144
You ran away.

01:03:04.264 --> 01:03:05.414
Three days ago.

01:03:06.207 --> 01:03:08.098
God help me if he finds me.

01:03:10.971 --> 01:03:12.814
Is your confessor still alive?

01:03:12.934 --> 01:03:14.068
Oh yes.

01:03:14.135 --> 01:03:16.351
You should denounce
him to the Church.

01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:18.637
He is the Church.

01:03:19.714 --> 01:03:21.175
But I sent him a letter

01:03:21.993 --> 01:03:23.911
from the ghost
of Jack Shareburg.

01:03:25.855 --> 01:03:26.729
What?

01:03:26.849 --> 01:03:29.031
Threatening to
expose his secret.

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:32.586
But it's all
I can do, is threaten.

01:03:34.055 --> 01:03:36.189
What would you do...

01:03:37.843 --> 01:03:39.526
To see justice done?

01:03:42.816 --> 01:03:44.294
Anything.

01:03:44.639 --> 01:03:46.089
Anything.

01:03:49.391 --> 01:03:53.769
For our church,
dear God, I would do anything.

01:04:01.868 --> 01:04:03.416
There are cracks
in the ceiling?

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.104
You mustn't use
the church again

01:04:05.171 --> 01:04:07.106
until I find
the cause and I fix it.

01:04:07.173 --> 01:04:09.689
You said you'd found
a way to support the weight.

01:04:09.809 --> 01:04:11.014
I thought I had.

01:04:11.134 --> 01:04:12.411
As did Alfred.

01:04:12.479 --> 01:04:13.913
No, the old walls were made

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.015
for a wooden ceiling,
but he used stone.

01:04:16.082 --> 01:04:17.917
These walls, they're
well-buttressed.

01:04:17.984 --> 01:04:19.084
They can hold the weight.

01:04:19.152 --> 01:04:20.619
So why is the ceiling cracking?

01:04:20.687 --> 01:04:24.356
I don't know, Prior!
I do not know.

01:04:24.424 --> 01:04:27.927
Tom would know.
I am not Tom.

01:04:42.042 --> 01:04:44.288
Richard! Richard!

01:04:44.711 --> 01:04:46.612
I missed you!

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.813
You're home!

01:04:48.848 --> 01:04:51.016
And happy to be here.

01:04:54.665 --> 01:04:57.689
You're holding
in your arms, dear sister,

01:04:57.809 --> 01:05:00.192
the new Earl of Shiring.

01:05:02.395 --> 01:05:04.029
It's true.

01:05:06.066 --> 01:05:08.500
King Stephen made it
official last week.

01:05:09.569 --> 01:05:10.769
Wonderful!

01:05:15.475 --> 01:05:18.177
Everything we worked for...

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.247
all these years...

01:05:24.231 --> 01:05:26.285
Finally, we did it.

01:05:35.695 --> 01:05:38.063
There is one
minor complication.

01:05:39.161 --> 01:05:40.984
Before we move in,
we have to move William out.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.869
That shouldn't be difficult.
You have friends from the army.

01:05:43.937 --> 01:05:44.970
Surround the castle,

01:05:45.038 --> 01:05:47.106
and, if William doesn't
surrender, attack.

01:05:47.173 --> 01:05:49.808
In 17 years of civil war,
do you know how many times

01:05:49.876 --> 01:05:52.177
I've seen a castle
captured by frontal attack?

01:05:52.245 --> 01:05:53.379
None.

01:05:53.446 --> 01:05:56.749
They're taken by cowardice,
treachery and deception.

01:05:56.816 --> 01:06:00.619
We need to find a way in
without William knowing it.

01:06:01.788 --> 01:06:02.788
What?

01:06:03.923 --> 01:06:05.457
What are you smiling at?

01:06:05.525 --> 01:06:07.326
We have a way in.

01:06:15.702 --> 01:06:17.770
Get a rope round it.

01:06:17.837 --> 01:06:19.505
Yeah, open up.

01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:27.346
Richard's back.
He's won his title.

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:34.386
William Hamleigh is a tyrant!

01:06:34.454 --> 01:06:37.156
He's attacked Kingsbridge,
murdered its citizens,

01:06:37.223 --> 01:06:39.925
yet freely walks among us
whenever he wishes.

01:06:39.993 --> 01:06:43.328
King Stephen has seen fit
to strip him of his title,

01:06:43.396 --> 01:06:45.956
but it is up to us
to strip him of his lands.

01:06:46.076 --> 01:06:49.169
I have soldiers,
friends from the crusade

01:06:49.289 --> 01:06:51.837
who will lead the charge and
bear the brunt of the battle,

01:06:51.905 --> 01:06:54.506
but I need men to back them up.

01:06:54.574 --> 01:06:56.975
I will reward you
with what gold we capture.

01:06:57.043 --> 01:07:00.412
William will be punished
for the evil he has done,

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.383
and the blood of your wives
and children will be avenged!

01:07:05.652 --> 01:07:08.020
There's not enough
of us to take a castle!

01:07:08.088 --> 01:07:11.023
We'll never make it
inside the gate.

01:07:11.091 --> 01:07:12.724
Oh yes, we will.

01:07:12.792 --> 01:07:15.194
We have a friend
who will help us.

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:27.339
What is it?

01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:30.742
You look like
you need to confess.

01:07:34.114 --> 01:07:38.250
I've been an ass and an idiot.

01:07:38.318 --> 01:07:41.053
Well, if that's a sin,
we'll all burn in hell.

01:07:42.989 --> 01:07:44.223
What about?

01:07:44.825 --> 01:07:47.826
Aliena, the roof,

01:07:47.894 --> 01:07:50.729
everything that is
important in my life.

01:07:54.134 --> 01:07:56.935
What you said
this morning was right.

01:07:58.104 --> 01:07:59.505
You're right, you're not Tom.

01:07:59.572 --> 01:08:03.509
You're Jack, which is
something much better.

01:08:03.576 --> 01:08:06.879
Tom was a dreamer with enough
faith to give his dreams weight,

01:08:06.946 --> 01:08:08.447
but you...

01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:12.918
you have an exceptional gift.

01:08:13.797 --> 01:08:17.089
And you have determination
instead of faith.

01:08:17.157 --> 01:08:20.926
We all need faith, Jack.

01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:24.376
It makes it easier
for God to help us.

01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:27.036
And Aliena believes
in you more than you do.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.420
How much faith
do you have in her?

01:08:33.872 --> 01:08:35.674
What do you mean, Prior?

01:08:36.055 --> 01:08:39.899
She left an hour ago with Richard and
an army of men to retake Shiring.

01:08:41.648 --> 01:08:44.015
She's gone? Prior?

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:00.999
Edgar.

01:09:01.067 --> 01:09:02.568
Hmm? Oh, milady.

01:09:02.635 --> 01:09:04.636
Is Lord William here?

01:09:04.703 --> 01:09:07.038
No, he's out looking for you.

01:09:09.809 --> 01:09:11.877
Assemble everyone
in the courtyard.

01:09:11.944 --> 01:09:13.612
I have an announcement to make.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.680
Yes, milady.

01:09:15.782 --> 01:09:17.082
Leave it open, Edgar.

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:18.082
But, milady?

01:09:18.151 --> 01:09:19.685
Leave it open.

01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:27.059
All, silence for milady!

01:09:28.361 --> 01:09:31.162
I have come
to bid you all goodbye.

01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:32.631
I am no longer your lady

01:09:32.698 --> 01:09:35.334
because my husband
is no longer your earl.

01:09:37.069 --> 01:09:39.371
King Stephen has awarded
the title to Richard,

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:41.240
whose father once ruled here,

01:09:41.307 --> 01:09:45.676
and whose sister, Aliena,
some of you may remember.

01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:51.582
I am surrendering the castle
to the rightful Earl of Shiring,

01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:54.853
and command you all
to lay down your weapons.

01:09:54.921 --> 01:09:57.589
There will be no bloodshed.

01:10:43.136 --> 01:10:45.716
The castle is taken, Walter.

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:47.572
But I'm not!

01:10:52.478 --> 01:10:53.779
No bloodshed!

01:10:53.846 --> 01:10:55.113
No, wait.

01:11:20.039 --> 01:11:21.306
Ah!

01:12:02.248 --> 01:12:03.849
Now we're even.

01:12:16.295 --> 01:12:18.530
Now we're even.

01:12:37.316 --> 01:12:41.186
She betrayed me, my own wife.

01:12:41.254 --> 01:12:42.854
If you kick a dog...

01:12:43.856 --> 01:12:45.957
it may someday bite you.

01:12:46.025 --> 01:12:48.160
Your mother never learned that,

01:12:48.227 --> 01:12:49.995
and now she burns
in eternal fire.

01:12:50.062 --> 01:12:52.030
Nonsense, she is in heaven,

01:12:52.098 --> 01:12:54.633
kneeling before
the throne of God.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.869
She's in hell, William, and
rumor has it you put her there.

01:12:58.971 --> 01:13:00.672
What can I do?

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.775
I'll build a chapel
in exchange for her salvation.

01:13:03.843 --> 01:13:05.310
It's too late for that.

01:13:05.378 --> 01:13:08.713
All you can do
is save yourself now.

01:13:08.781 --> 01:13:09.815
How?

01:13:10.817 --> 01:13:12.117
I'll do anything.

01:13:15.021 --> 01:13:16.655
This isn't fair!

01:13:16.722 --> 01:13:18.784
No, it isn't.

01:13:18.904 --> 01:13:19.991
Very little
is fair in this life,

01:13:20.059 --> 01:13:21.793
and the forces
of evil are strong.

01:13:21.861 --> 01:13:23.428
And make no mistake about it.

01:13:23.496 --> 01:13:26.198
It's the devil we're fighting,
and the scores are even.

01:13:26.891 --> 01:13:29.734
But this is why
I called you here.

01:13:30.758 --> 01:13:33.438
I have the authority
to appoint a district sheriff.

01:13:33.506 --> 01:13:35.307
What would you say
if I appointed you?

01:13:35.374 --> 01:13:37.142
I am not a sheriff.

01:13:38.144 --> 01:13:39.911
I am a lord.

01:13:41.214 --> 01:13:44.115
Don't try my patience, William.

01:13:44.183 --> 01:13:48.420
I will want you to make
an arrest for murder soon.

01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:51.223
- Who?
- Who murdered whom?

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:54.726
No one's murdered anyone, yet.

01:13:54.794 --> 01:13:55.961
I don't follow.

01:13:56.028 --> 01:13:58.096
No, I don't expect you to.

01:13:59.098 --> 01:14:00.665
Trust me, William.

01:14:00.733 --> 01:14:04.202
I'm laying a trap for a witch.

01:14:34.834 --> 01:14:36.334
Ma.

01:14:37.803 --> 01:14:41.072
What are you doing here?
Why were you in the crypt?

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.409
I'm retrieving an old letter
for a new friend.

01:14:46.579 --> 01:14:49.748
Trust me, Jack. I'm laying
a trap for a bishop.

01:14:57.256 --> 01:14:58.890
Alfred! Brother, wake up.

01:14:58.958 --> 01:15:01.493
There's someone here
to see you. Wake up.

01:15:01.561 --> 01:15:02.761
Tell them I'm not well.

01:15:02.828 --> 01:15:04.963
You're well enough.
Now get on your feet.

01:15:05.031 --> 01:15:07.432
I'll bring some water
so you can wash your face.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.834
- Why? Who is it?
- It's Cardinal Waleran.

01:15:19.145 --> 01:15:20.178
Your Eminence.

01:15:20.246 --> 01:15:21.346
Oh, do get up.

01:15:21.414 --> 01:15:23.748
Did Martha offer you
something to eat? We'd be...

01:15:23.816 --> 01:15:26.117
I have no time. I'm here
to grant you a favor.

01:15:26.185 --> 01:15:29.054
Is it the annulment?
Will I be able to marry again?

01:15:29.121 --> 01:15:32.857
Follow my wishes, you'll be
able to do whatever you want.

01:15:33.926 --> 01:15:36.127
What's that?
A dagger?

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:39.731
What?

01:15:44.003 --> 01:15:47.205
I want you to provoke
Jack Jackson into a fight.

01:15:47.273 --> 01:15:48.540
You want me to kill him?

01:15:48.608 --> 01:15:51.209
No, of course not.
That would be murder.

01:15:52.211 --> 01:15:53.378
What then?

01:15:53.446 --> 01:15:56.881
I want you to make
Jackson spill some blood:

01:15:56.949 --> 01:15:58.183
yours.

01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:59.618
My blood?

01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:02.687
If it's convenient. Just
a few drops, nothing serious.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.724
Why?

01:16:05.791 --> 01:16:07.659
So I can have him arrested.

01:16:07.727 --> 01:16:09.227
I'll deal with the rest.

01:16:09.295 --> 01:16:11.730
Do this, I'll dissolve
your marriage

01:16:11.797 --> 01:16:13.331
and make you a free man.

01:16:13.399 --> 01:16:15.667
And you can marry
whoever you want.

01:16:15.735 --> 01:16:18.103
Do you, um, have
a bride picked out?

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:19.571
Several.

01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:26.478
Glad to be of service.

01:16:32.685 --> 01:16:34.285
I'm returning to England...

01:16:35.755 --> 01:16:38.323
to fight for my rightful crown.

01:16:38.391 --> 01:16:41.059
Our soldiers are returning
from the crusade, Mother.

01:16:41.127 --> 01:16:41.982
They'll support me.

01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:44.329
- Henry...
- Don't you dare forbid it!

01:16:44.397 --> 01:16:47.532
I would be ashamed
if you didn't want this,

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.434
but Father Francis here believes

01:16:49.502 --> 01:16:51.970
the crown can be won
with ink, not blood.

01:16:55.007 --> 01:16:58.343
Stephen is old and his son,
Eustace, weak and unpopular.

01:17:02.448 --> 01:17:06.251
Let me travel with you and
try to negotiate a compromise.

01:17:07.653 --> 01:17:11.756
I don't believe in compromise.
Compromise is for cowards.

01:17:11.824 --> 01:17:14.993
I spit in the face of fear.

01:17:16.529 --> 01:17:19.064
I'm assembling an army!

01:17:21.834 --> 01:17:22.967
You done there?

01:17:23.035 --> 01:17:24.769
You have to go on your own.

01:17:24.837 --> 01:17:27.739
The vault's cracking,
not because of the weight,

01:17:27.807 --> 01:17:29.307
but because of the height,

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:30.775
because of the wind.

01:17:30.843 --> 01:17:31.976
I don't follow.

01:17:32.044 --> 01:17:33.511
Come. Here.

01:17:33.579 --> 01:17:36.681
This here, this is
the wall of the church.

01:17:36.749 --> 01:17:39.851
Now place your hand
flat across my fingers

01:17:39.919 --> 01:17:41.286
as if it were the roof.

01:17:41.353 --> 01:17:43.154
Right, now press down.

01:17:44.356 --> 01:17:48.026
So, as Euclid says, the wall
of my arm holds that weight.

01:17:48.094 --> 01:17:49.461
Now, instead of the roof,

01:17:49.528 --> 01:17:53.398
imagine your hand is the
wind blowing against my arm.

01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:56.835
Do you see?

01:17:56.902 --> 01:18:00.238
The vault's cracking
because the walls are moving.

01:18:00.306 --> 01:18:02.107
It's the wind
that's causing it.

01:18:02.174 --> 01:18:04.943
It's no coincidence that
I discovered the cracks

01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:06.845
on the night of the storm.

01:18:08.214 --> 01:18:11.149
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Take this one instead.

01:18:11.217 --> 01:18:13.551
It's better than
the Italian fabric,

01:18:13.619 --> 01:18:15.253
and the color won't fade.

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:21.659
You see, all these parts,
not just the walls,

01:18:21.727 --> 01:18:24.395
were meant to work together
to support the whole.

01:18:24.463 --> 01:18:25.930
It's like a team of workers.

01:18:25.998 --> 01:18:27.532
I learned this in France.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.668
Now, the wind is a new force
working against us.

01:18:30.736 --> 01:18:33.104
It wasn't as strong
in Saint Denis.

01:18:33.172 --> 01:18:34.873
So, what we're looking for

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.810
is a new part that's
not yet been invented.

01:18:38.878 --> 01:18:42.614
Now, look at the bird
and follow me.

01:18:47.219 --> 01:18:49.921
I'm heading out
to buy some flowers.

01:18:49.989 --> 01:18:52.657
Hey, look..
Feel that, feel that, eh?

01:19:01.767 --> 01:19:04.602
So, it's a taller buttress,
at least 20 feet higher,

01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:06.371
but with these
second half arches

01:19:06.438 --> 01:19:08.373
that leap across
to the exterior wall

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.775
near where those cracks
are forming.

01:19:10.843 --> 01:19:13.178
So, it will brace
the top half of the church

01:19:13.245 --> 01:19:16.080
and keep these walls rigid
when the wind blows.

01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:18.983
But won't the higher
buttresses appear rather naked?

01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.889
Well, if we try and hide them with
more walls, we lose the light.

01:19:22.648 --> 01:19:24.815
What's wrong with
them appearing naked

01:19:24.832 --> 01:19:27.954
so long as they're strong and
elegant, like the bird's wing?

01:19:44.176 --> 01:19:46.551
Good morning, dear wife.

01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:50.376
Winged buttresses?

01:19:50.611 --> 01:19:51.425
Exactly.

01:19:51.472 --> 01:19:53.732
Jack! It's Alfred,
he's drunk.

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:55.266
I've never seen him so wild.

01:19:55.386 --> 01:19:56.096
What do you mean?

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.404
He attacked Aliena.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.681
What happened?

01:20:05.486 --> 01:20:07.765
The arm, too.

01:20:08.989 --> 01:20:10.390
I've been worse.

01:20:14.894 --> 01:20:16.275
Jack!

01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:20.382
Alfred!

01:20:21.445 --> 01:20:22.688
Alfred!

01:20:24.372 --> 01:20:26.213
Serves plenty!!
A pitcher now!

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:27.949
Serves this many!

01:21:03.029 --> 01:21:05.059
Bastard stabbed me!

01:21:05.758 --> 01:21:08.860
Everyone, Jack Bastard
stabbed me unprovoked!

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.241
No, he attacked Aliena.

01:21:10.361 --> 01:21:11.451
She's my wife!

01:21:12.143 --> 01:21:15.271
My wife, sister, look what
Jack Bastard did to me.

01:21:15.391 --> 01:21:17.579
He scratched himself,
Aliena. It was his own knife.

01:21:17.699 --> 01:21:19.292
I've never seen
it before in my life!

01:21:19.678 --> 01:21:21.863
Why should I stab myself?

01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:25.033
It's Aliena I wanna stab,
and not with a knife.

01:21:26.335 --> 01:21:27.769
Ha ha!

01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:36.241
What?

01:21:51.898 --> 01:21:53.031
He tricked me!

01:21:53.151 --> 01:21:55.268
- What?
- It was poisoned.

01:21:55.987 --> 01:21:57.534
Dear God!

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.683
- What is happening?
- I don't know.

01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:53.678
For Maud, Queen of England!

01:23:18.738 --> 01:23:20.673
Eustace! Eustace!

01:23:20.793 --> 01:23:21.529
Yes?

01:23:22.288 --> 01:23:23.319
I'm Henry.

01:23:24.271 --> 01:23:25.528
Pleased to meet you, cousin.

01:23:31.036 --> 01:23:32.127
Dead?

01:23:32.998 --> 01:23:36.437
Not dead.
My son is not dead.

01:23:42.135 --> 01:23:44.509
No, no.

01:23:44.785 --> 01:23:46.316
No!

01:23:46.436 --> 01:23:48.332
Your Majesty, no.

01:23:48.567 --> 01:23:50.404
Your Majesty!

01:23:51.467 --> 01:23:53.569
Your Majesty, please!

01:23:57.551 --> 01:24:00.575
Eustace, dear boy,
you're alive!

01:24:01.611 --> 01:24:03.033
You're alive!

01:24:04.814 --> 01:24:07.449
No. No!

01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:34.834
What is the meaning of this?

01:24:34.954 --> 01:24:37.195
As newly appointed
district sheriff,

01:24:37.419 --> 01:24:38.953
I've come to arrest
Jack Jackson

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:40.199
for the murder
of Alfred Thomson.

01:24:40.319 --> 01:24:42.243
This cathedral
stands on holy ground.

01:24:42.363 --> 01:24:44.357
No arrest can be made
under the laws of sanctuary.

01:24:44.477 --> 01:24:46.677
Now take your men and
your horses and leave.

01:24:46.797 --> 01:24:48.762
Not so fast, good prior.

01:24:49.065 --> 01:24:51.866
The laws of sanctuary
only apply to churches

01:24:51.933 --> 01:24:53.673
that have been
dedicated and sanctified.

01:24:53.793 --> 01:24:55.482
You should know that.

01:24:55.602 --> 01:24:59.701
This church is not yet finished,
so God's law has no power here.

01:25:00.108 --> 01:25:02.009
Seize him.

01:25:06.335 --> 01:25:08.849
What would you know
of God's law?

01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:11.986
Your Church is a church of
ambition, not of Christ.

01:25:12.053 --> 01:25:14.688
Holy ambition which
brings me closer to Christ.

01:25:14.756 --> 01:25:16.824
Is that why
you burned my father?

01:25:16.892 --> 01:25:18.659
The Church did.
I just sentenced him.

01:25:18.727 --> 01:25:20.227
But Lord Percy and Prior James

01:25:20.295 --> 01:25:22.096
were under your orders,
weren't they?

01:25:22.164 --> 01:25:24.031
I was merely a priest.

01:25:24.099 --> 01:25:28.035
With connections in court!
So, what did my father know?

01:25:28.103 --> 01:25:30.371
<i>Was it something to do
with the White Ship?</i>

01:25:30.439 --> 01:25:32.039
Gag him.
Prepare for trial.

01:25:32.107 --> 01:25:34.008
Send for the executioner
from Winchester.

01:25:35.911 --> 01:25:37.044
Yah!

01:25:40.282 --> 01:25:43.284
Try to finish
your cathedral now.

01:25:58.133 --> 01:25:59.900
Alfred Thomson was drunk.

01:25:59.968 --> 01:26:01.805
He attacked me
in the public square.

01:26:01.925 --> 01:26:02.937
As his wife.

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:06.537
You publicly rejected him.
His reaction was understandable.

01:26:06.854 --> 01:26:10.144
We haven't lived together
in nearly 10 years.

01:26:10.212 --> 01:26:13.414
All the more reason, I would
think, for his desperation, hmm?

01:26:16.165 --> 01:26:19.479
Did Jack Jackson
stab Alfred Thomson?

01:26:19.599 --> 01:26:22.170
The wound was not fatal.
It barely nicked his skin.

01:26:22.290 --> 01:26:25.835
Oh, not fatal? Perhaps your late husband
should testify to that.

01:26:27.996 --> 01:26:29.730
The dagger was poisoned.

01:26:29.798 --> 01:26:33.601
There are witnesses here who can
testify how Alfred Thomson died.

01:26:33.668 --> 01:26:37.471
Furthermore, the weapon belonged
neither to Alfred nor to Jack.

01:26:37.539 --> 01:26:40.207
This is mere quibbling.
Take the witness down.

01:26:49.248 --> 01:26:50.718
The facts are clear.

01:26:50.785 --> 01:26:52.853
Alfred Thomson died
from a stab wound

01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:55.890
administered by Jack Jackson,
who is hereby condemned

01:26:55.957 --> 01:26:57.625
to be hanged by
the neck until dead.

01:26:57.692 --> 01:26:59.293
And may God have
mercy on his soul.

01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:01.228
Proceed with the execution.

01:27:01.296 --> 01:27:02.796
No! No! It was murder,

01:27:02.864 --> 01:27:05.232
but the one that poisoned the
dagger should hang, not Jack!

01:27:05.352 --> 01:27:07.776
Silence, woman. Silence!

01:27:08.853 --> 01:27:11.071
I have evidence!

01:27:11.139 --> 01:27:13.407
There is no need
for more evidence.

01:27:13.475 --> 01:27:15.543
The prisoner
has been condemned.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.745
Evidence

01:27:17.812 --> 01:27:20.414
of the murder
of a future king...

01:27:22.183 --> 01:27:23.951
of regicide.

01:27:25.987 --> 01:27:27.922
What is she talking about?

01:27:27.989 --> 01:27:30.958
- She's a madwoman!
- She's lying to save her son.

01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:35.796
That woman was condemned
as a witch years ago

01:27:35.864 --> 01:27:37.531
and has evaded
the law ever since.

01:27:37.599 --> 01:27:38.947
So, we'll have
2 hangings today.

01:27:39.067 --> 01:27:41.087
Mother, run. Run!

01:27:41.207 --> 01:27:45.739
No. There's been too much
running from the law in Kingsbridge.

01:27:45.807 --> 01:27:47.808
I have the evidence here.

01:27:47.876 --> 01:27:50.277
Quiet! Let her speak!

01:27:50.345 --> 01:27:52.479
Evidence of treason.

01:27:52.547 --> 01:27:55.651
The chalice was planted
on Jacques Cherbourg

01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:59.255
at the request of
Prior James of Kingsbridge.

01:27:59.504 --> 01:28:03.285
He was tortured and burned.
An innocent man!

01:28:03.405 --> 01:28:06.260
This is nonsense,
total nonsense.

01:28:06.328 --> 01:28:09.122
This has nothing
to do with this trial.

01:28:09.242 --> 01:28:10.792
Seize her and
hang her right away.

01:28:10.912 --> 01:28:13.596
As prior of Kingsbridge,
let me remind Your Eminence...

01:28:13.716 --> 01:28:15.764
Let me remind you,
Prior Philip.

01:28:15.884 --> 01:28:18.422
This is a trial
for murder, not treason.

01:28:18.542 --> 01:28:22.710
Let me remind you
that you are on priory land

01:28:22.777 --> 01:28:24.176
within priory walls.

01:28:24.296 --> 01:28:25.691
Let this woman speak.

01:28:43.698 --> 01:28:46.834
35 years ago, I found a man...

01:28:47.511 --> 01:28:50.771
Jack Jackson's father,
near drowned on a beach.

01:28:50.839 --> 01:28:53.807
He held a secret for the king.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.612
<i>And before he was
taken by his enemies,</i>

01:28:56.732 --> 01:29:01.215
<i>he asked me for quill,
paper, ink and sealing wax.</i>

01:29:01.282 --> 01:29:04.318
<i>I never saw his letter
until a few days ago.</i>

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.118
When he was brought here
and stripped for torture,

01:29:09.238 --> 01:29:13.427
one of the monks discovered
it hidden in his clothing.

01:29:22.303 --> 01:29:24.805
<i>This monk concealed
what he found,</i>

01:29:24.873 --> 01:29:27.875
<i>certain that, if anyone
knew what he had read,</i>

01:29:27.942 --> 01:29:30.477
he too would be eliminated.

01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:32.846
This...

01:29:33.331 --> 01:29:36.083
is Jacques Cherbourg's story.

01:29:36.151 --> 01:29:38.218
Jacques Cherbourg, who is he?

01:29:38.286 --> 01:29:39.453
I don't know.

01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:44.525
<i>"Your Majesty,
I was a jongleur</i>

01:29:44.592 --> 01:29:48.395
<i>"hired by young Prince William
to sail with him to England.</i>

01:29:48.463 --> 01:29:51.432
<i>"The ship was set ablaze,
and people were drowning."</i>

01:29:51.499 --> 01:29:52.933
Help! Help!

01:29:52.967 --> 01:29:54.450
God save me!

01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:57.543
<i>"Being the only good swimmer,
I managed to stay afloat,</i>

01:29:57.663 --> 01:29:59.507
<i>"and saw the prince
and his bride</i>

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:01.371
<i>"save themselves
in a rowboat,</i>

01:30:01.491 --> 01:30:05.313
<i>"along with Father Waleran
and Lord and Lady Hamleigh.</i>

01:30:06.141 --> 01:30:09.183
<i>"I was about to call
to the prince for help</i>

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:11.719
<i>"when the
unthinkable happened."</i>

01:30:23.867 --> 01:30:25.866
Kill her, Percy!

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:46.167
<i>"I tried to save him,
but it was too late.</i>

01:30:46.664 --> 01:30:50.268
<i>"His ring, however,
slipped off into my hand.</i>

01:30:52.558 --> 01:30:55.229
<i>"Your Majesty,
your son's ring</i>

01:30:55.296 --> 01:30:57.831
<i>"is the proof
of what I saw."</i>

01:31:01.555 --> 01:31:05.923
"I swear to the truth of these
words on my immortal soul.

01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:08.709
"Jacques Cherbourg."

01:31:08.777 --> 01:31:10.644
- Murderer!
- It's the bishop!

01:31:10.712 --> 01:31:12.312
Hang the bishop!

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.714
- Murderer!
- Murderer!

01:31:13.782 --> 01:31:15.215
Let the bishop have it!

01:31:15.283 --> 01:31:18.367
There is no proof this
is anything but a forgery.

01:31:18.487 --> 01:31:21.502
He sealed it with
the lost prince's ring.

01:31:21.622 --> 01:31:23.412
Another forgery, another lie.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.926
He gave me the ring
for safekeeping,

01:31:25.994 --> 01:31:27.194
and I gave it to Jack.

01:31:27.262 --> 01:31:29.696
And Alfred stole it!

01:31:29.764 --> 01:31:32.266
So, there is no ring.
There is no ring!

01:31:32.333 --> 01:31:36.024
Pity, it might have given
a glint of truth to your story.

01:31:36.144 --> 01:31:37.471
Proceed with the execution.

01:31:37.539 --> 01:31:39.506
No! No!

01:31:39.574 --> 01:31:40.814
No!

01:31:40.934 --> 01:31:42.843
It's here!

01:31:42.911 --> 01:31:44.077
Martha.

01:31:56.991 --> 01:31:59.026
I took it from Jack years ago.

01:31:59.686 --> 01:32:02.130
<i>Because he said
it was worthless,</i>

01:32:02.931 --> 01:32:04.518
<i>and I thought
it was pretty.</i>

01:32:05.623 --> 01:32:08.468
He accused Alfred
of stealing it.

01:32:09.284 --> 01:32:11.659
<i>When I tried
to tell him differently,</i>

01:32:12.474 --> 01:32:14.374
<i>I grew afraid.</i>

01:32:18.813 --> 01:32:20.447
I kept it, Jack...

01:32:21.783 --> 01:32:23.984
because you loved
Aliena so and...

01:32:26.261 --> 01:32:29.326
I wanted a little bit
of you for myself.

01:32:31.025 --> 01:32:33.227
This proves nothing.

01:32:34.154 --> 01:32:35.936
It proves, once again,

01:32:36.056 --> 01:32:39.299
that the citizens of Kingsbridge
have been used unlawfully

01:32:39.367 --> 01:32:41.668
by Bishop Waleran
and William Hamleigh.

01:32:41.736 --> 01:32:44.006
You've attacked
this town twice,

01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:46.685
killing our husbands,
our wives, our children.

01:32:46.805 --> 01:32:49.843
And now you attack again
by murdering the one man

01:32:49.911 --> 01:32:52.179
that has brought
this town back to life.

01:32:53.414 --> 01:32:55.482
No! You will not touch her!

01:33:08.165 --> 01:33:10.016
Burn in hell!

01:33:11.299 --> 01:33:12.900
Hang the two!

01:33:14.736 --> 01:33:17.537
It's not me!
It's not me!

01:33:18.283 --> 01:33:21.320
It's the bishop!
It's Waleran! He set me on to it.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.696
Silence! Silence!

01:33:24.027 --> 01:33:26.013
Allow him to be heard.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.315
He was
Prince William's confessor,

01:33:28.383 --> 01:33:29.416
and Stephen's.

01:33:29.484 --> 01:33:31.784
He went to Stephen
and made a bargain.

01:33:31.904 --> 01:33:33.441
<i>With Prince William dead,</i>

01:33:33.561 --> 01:33:35.803
Stephen would be
in direct line to the throne.

01:33:35.923 --> 01:33:37.996
He recruited
my parents to help.

01:33:38.116 --> 01:33:40.150
And together,
they scuttled the ship

01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:42.498
and murdered
the prince and his wife.

01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:45.242
For this, my parents were
given land and position,

01:33:45.285 --> 01:33:47.225
but he did it for power.

01:33:47.345 --> 01:33:51.381
But I did nothing. As God
is my witness, I did nothing.

01:33:53.499 --> 01:33:55.742
I don't want to die!

01:33:59.412 --> 01:34:00.876
Let go of me!

01:34:26.507 --> 01:34:28.608
Citizens of Kingsbridge...

01:34:29.732 --> 01:34:33.386
you have brought the wrath
of God upon yourselves.

01:34:33.948 --> 01:34:38.085
You harbor liars, witches,

01:34:38.152 --> 01:34:40.921
sodomites and thieves.

01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:45.258
And unholy priests!

01:34:49.163 --> 01:34:50.928
Because of your treachery,

01:34:51.048 --> 01:34:54.367
England has been steeped
in blood for 16 years.

01:34:55.641 --> 01:34:59.072
Soldiers have died,
wives mourned,

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.208
sons grown fatherless
into manhood

01:35:01.275 --> 01:35:04.544
and then gone themselves
to fight and to die.

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:08.615
This town has been burned,

01:35:08.683 --> 01:35:11.485
its citizens slaughtered...

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.520
and yet, still we survive.

01:35:14.769 --> 01:35:18.846
We build a cathedral like
none has ever seen before

01:35:18.966 --> 01:35:22.050
in praise of God
and our abilities

01:35:22.170 --> 01:35:25.432
and our faith
in some peaceful tomorrow.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.901
And in spite
of you, Waleran Bigod,

01:35:27.969 --> 01:35:32.039
the people of Kingsbridge
will find that peace.

01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:35.909
Take hold of that man!

01:35:51.426 --> 01:35:53.974
I claim sanctuary!

01:35:54.094 --> 01:35:56.312
I am your bishop
and this is holy ground.

01:35:56.432 --> 01:35:59.670
There is no sanctuary,
you said so yourself.

01:36:00.034 --> 01:36:01.501
He spilled our blood!

01:36:27.728 --> 01:36:29.329
There he is!

01:36:29.397 --> 01:36:30.897
There's Waleran!

01:37:23.618 --> 01:37:25.218
There he is!

01:38:08.429 --> 01:38:10.430
- No, Jack!
- No, Jack!

01:38:34.722 --> 01:38:37.591
And you, you shall
one day climb very high...

01:38:38.593 --> 01:38:40.126
only to fall.

01:39:13.928 --> 01:39:17.364
<i>Ego te absolvo.</i>

01:40:31.272 --> 01:40:34.441
<i>When we began work
on the Kingsbridge Cathedral,</i>

01:40:34.508 --> 01:40:37.084
<i>King Stephen was newly crowned,
and the Princess Maud</i>

01:40:37.204 --> 01:40:40.370
<i>fled to France with
her newborn son, Henry.</i>

01:40:41.157 --> 01:40:45.752
<i>For years, England was torn
by war and great suffering.</i>

01:40:46.223 --> 01:40:48.142
<i>King Stephen is since dead,</i>

01:40:48.262 --> 01:40:52.592
<i>and Maud's son now rules
as King Henry II of England.</i>

01:40:53.210 --> 01:40:56.827
<i>Now we have peace and
hope for a bright tomorrow.</i>

01:40:57.062 --> 01:40:59.920
<i>And for these gifts
and our beautiful church,</i>

01:41:00.279 --> 01:41:04.580
<i>I thank God, our king,
the people of Kingsbridge</i>

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:08.673
<i>and several generations
of tireless workers.</i>

01:41:10.026 --> 01:41:12.410
<i>But the cathedral
is not finished</i>

01:41:13.247 --> 01:41:15.348
<i>and nor will it ever be.</i>

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:20.029
<i>Just as human perfection
is something we all strive for</i>

01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:21.330
<i>and can never attain,</i>

01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:23.824
<i>so this church will
forever be changing,</i>

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:27.037
<i>growing, crumbling at times...</i>

01:41:27.659 --> 01:41:31.585
an ongoing legacy of our
feeble efforts to touch God.

01:41:31.957 --> 01:41:36.369
A cathedral, my friends,
is... is neither stone nor statues

01:41:36.437 --> 01:41:38.071
nor even a place of prayer.

01:41:38.139 --> 01:41:39.139
It is...

01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:42.275
a continuum of creation...

01:41:43.171 --> 01:41:47.439
beautiful work that,
pray God, will never end.

01:41:49.904 --> 01:41:53.867
And, as one final note of grace,
I... Need I point this out?

01:41:54.281 --> 01:41:57.157
Jack has finished the...

01:41:57.913 --> 01:42:02.677
windows with, whoever
heard of it, colored glass.

01:42:04.095 --> 01:42:06.408
He filled
this world with light.

01:42:06.698 --> 01:42:08.700
God be praised.
