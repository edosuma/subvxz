01:20.840 --> 01:22.180
Greetings, Muggles.

01:23.732 --> 01:26.860
- Oh, my fucking God. He fell for it.
- I told you he would.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.020
It's not really
fancy dress, you dick.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.740
Oh, what? No way!

01:30.840 --> 01:33.500
These are the jokers from my
course I was telling you about.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.140
You lot. Technically, I didn't fall for it
as there was no way I could have known.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.460
- Whoa. Where d'you think you're going?
- Into the party.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.500
You're dressed like Harry Potter.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.020
There's no way you're coming
in here, you fucking plum.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.860
You could have come as someone sexy.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.602
Hermione's sexy.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.904
What a twat.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.780
Mental.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.141
Guys?

01:55.800 --> 01:56.980
Guys?

01:57.080 --> 01:59.228
Oh, piss off, Harry.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.100
Well, this is a disaster.
I've come down from Sheffield for this?

02:03.200 --> 02:05.020
It's OK. We'll still
have a good weekend.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.940
There's a pub I love
just down the road.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.340
I'm wearing a gym skirt.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.860
It's a student town.
No one will care.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.824
- And no pants.
- Righto.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.300
Oi, Si. Nudgies.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.946
- What the fuck?
- Sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.660
Fuck me. What a waste of a weekend.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.020
I thought you said they were
your best mates at uni.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.620
- Yeah.
- I'll find us some mates.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.029
I've got this amazing app called Grindr.
Made loads of new mates through it.

02:29.887 --> 02:31.620
Oh, my gosh, you'll never guess what.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.700
- Someone's sent you a penis shot?
- Nah, I just got an email from Jay.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.700
- No way.
- Way. Listen to this.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.780
"Dear Neil, you fucking weapon..."

02:38.880 --> 02:40.900
As you know, I am on
a mental gap year,

02:41.000 --> 02:42.226
in Australia.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.700
Or outback... as they say over here.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.060
So I thought I'd email you,
not because I miss you lot

02:49.160 --> 02:52.380
but because this place is a million
out of ten and you'll be well jel.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.582
Life has never been better.

02:55.560 --> 02:59.300
It's much better than when I was going out
with Jane, who I now no longer think about.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.060
I'm living near a town called Sydney

03:01.160 --> 03:04.867
and working at the most mental club
in Australia called Revolutions.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.660
I am now their premier
number one DJ...

03:08.760 --> 03:10.862
Good evening, ladies!

03:11.080 --> 03:13.340
...going by the name of DJ Big Penis,

03:13.440 --> 03:15.588
which everyone agrees
is the perfect name.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.180
I've made so much cashola,
which is Australian for money,

03:24.280 --> 03:28.300
that I've bought myself a fuck-off
mansion and filled it full of pussay.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.220
And like Will's mum's appetite
for cock, it's enormous.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.060
Before that, I was living with
Uncle Bryan, who's my dad's cousin,

03:34.160 --> 03:36.991
although he is tragic and
obviously not as cool as my dad.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.866
What's that?

03:40.520 --> 03:43.980
Anyway, it will come as no surprise to you
the number of Aussie birds I'm rooting,

03:44.080 --> 03:46.182
which is Australian for knobbing.

03:47.106 --> 03:48.326
Yes!

03:49.200 --> 03:52.140
They're total filth and
fuck like kangaroos,

03:52.240 --> 03:54.547
all big teeth,
bouncing and wet pouches.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.626
I make love to them with a technique
I like to call the one-pump orgasm.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.180
They absolutely love it. Name an
Aussie bird and I've fucked her.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.740
Elle Macpherson: check.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.860
Dame Edna Everage: check.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.660
Kylie and Dannii Minogue three-way?

04:11.760 --> 04:14.100
I'd done that ten minutes
after getting off the plane.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.500
And mates? I've made loads of cool
new mates who come round for dinner.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.702
But really it's all about the birds.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.940
Aussie sheilas just can't get enough
of Jay, especially the supermodels,

04:25.040 --> 04:27.507
who, by the way,
love it up the shitter.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.220
I've been woken up by a blowjob from
a different girl every single morning.

04:33.320 --> 04:37.391
You can imagine what that's like,
waking up every morning to a blowie.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.940
<i>What is this I'm feeling?</i>

04:41.040 --> 04:42.420
They keep it so clean.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.220
I haven't had to wash
my cock in weeks.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.780
Basically, everything's better
than when I was with Jane,

04:46.880 --> 04:49.623
who, as I mentioned,
I no longer think about.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.300
<i>To give up who we are</i>

04:53.400 --> 04:55.860
On the minus side, I've had to
punch out a few koala bears,

04:55.960 --> 04:59.143
normally when they drop out of
the trees and try to fight me.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.510
Mug! Have it!

05:02.600 --> 05:06.580
But other than that, it's been bonza,
which is Australian for fucking brilliant.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.060
Come and stay any time you like.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.180
I guarantee I'll get you sucked
drier than Simon's mum's fanny.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.620
Say hello to those other two
dozy pricks if you see them.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.948
Tell your bent dad
he still can't bum me.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.740
<i>- We're up all night for good fun</i>
- Oh.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.660
And tell your fit sister
that I'd like to...

05:19.760 --> 05:21.924
- Oh, no, come on.
- What does it say?

05:22.580 --> 05:25.300
"I'd like to chew on those massive
juicy burger nipples of hers,

05:25.400 --> 05:28.220
reach my thumb round and..."
Oh, no, it's too much.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.540
Oi, get off!

05:29.640 --> 05:30.700
Oi!

05:30.800 --> 05:33.620
- Oh, there's more. "Flip her over..."
- What a lovely email.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.260
"...spoodge down her face, over her back,
clunge, wellies, anal, anal, anal..."

05:37.360 --> 05:38.460
This goes on a bit.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.900
Australia sounds a laugh.
Not like hanging out with you two.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.740
Wish I'd gone to Australia this
weekend instead of shitty Bristol.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.860
You know it's on the
other side of the world?

05:45.960 --> 05:48.180
- Doubt it.
- Excuse me, mate. You're on.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.780
Oh, at last, something decent.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.187
- Is this seat taken?
- Yeah, sorry, it is.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.900
- Have you got any friends at university?
- Of course I have, Simon.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.780
I'm just lucky that I've managed to not
get tied down to a clique or a group.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.780
- I'm free to hang out with anyone and everyone.
- Or no one.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.380
You changed universities just
to be with your girlfriend.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.020
I've got mates other than Lucy.
Pete, for one.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.580
- Who's Pete?
- Pete from my halls.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.023
I must have mentioned Pete.
Pete. Pete, my best mate.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.900
My best mate at uni.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.460
I do spend a lot of time with Lucy.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.900
Although she has changed a
bit since we were on holiday.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.260
And, well, what's the word
when someone's not nicer?

06:24.360 --> 06:27.140
- Nastier?
- Yeah. I think that's it, maybe.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.780
- She's nastier.
- Right, out. You're barred.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.620
Barred? What?

06:32.720 --> 06:33.981
Why?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.300
That.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.500
So we're all on the same page,
that's me, Will McKenzie,

06:41.600 --> 06:44.700
seemingly Bristol University's
least popular undergraduate.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.580
And that's my friend Simon, who's got
university relationship problems of his own.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.940
Who's this fucking slut,
Kirsty Scott?

06:51.040 --> 06:54.349
- Lucy, are you on my Facebook again?
- Goodbye, whore.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.671
Simon, swear on your hoodie
you're not going to cheat on me.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.785
What? Oh, no, please, Lucy,
that's my favourite.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.660
- Lucy.
- Sorry, Simon.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.466
But I just have to be sure.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.664
I just love you so much.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.500
I love you too, cuddles.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.980
And finally, there's Neil.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.784
At least he's made a new friend.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.660
Buster.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.340
I don't know what brand
of shower gel Neil uses,

07:31.440 --> 07:33.660
but I suspect it might
be Pedigree Chum.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.228
And as we headed back to my room, if I'd
assumed watching some low-level bestiality

07:37.328 --> 07:40.008
would be the low point of
my night, I was wrong.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.702
Oh, not again!

07:44.320 --> 07:46.627
Is your room in space?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.867
Thank you, arseholes!

07:55.600 --> 07:57.907
They've done a pretty
good job, to be fair.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.348
I fucking hate it here.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.140
To be honest, I'm glad
I chose not to do uni.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.300
- More reality than a choice.
- Exactly.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.420
- Maybe we should go to Australia.
- And surprise the fuck out of Jay!

08:08.520 --> 08:09.740
- I was joking.
- Why?

08:09.840 --> 08:12.980
It's better than hanging round old
men's pubs and dressing up as magic.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.660
We get four weeks off for Easter.
I dread spending it with Lucy.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.780
- Can we afford it?
- Will, they invented student loans

08:18.880 --> 08:20.540
so students could go on holiday.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.300
And I got a sweet bonus this month.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.460
I'm the cleverest non-Asian
in the department.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.460
I have always wanted
to go travelling.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.900
I think I'd be good at it,
do it properly, not like Jay.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.260
- How can you be good at it?
- He's staying in one place.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.820
I'd explore, meet people, come back
a better and more rounded person.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.864
He's getting sucked
off every morning.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.831
Fuck it, I'm in.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.100
So, goodbye, shitty Bristol.
I was off to Australia.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.820
Now, petal, you know
how much I worry.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.751
- So I've got you a special holiday gift.
- Oh, thanks, Mum.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.380
It's...

08:55.480 --> 08:56.786
a rape alarm.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.580
What do you think is
gonna happen to me?

08:58.680 --> 09:01.220
- Petal, I think you might get raped.
- Right.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.740
Sweetie, it's better to have
a rape alarm and not need it

09:03.840 --> 09:07.820
than to get gang-raped in an alleyway by men
you may have, however innocently, led on.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.700
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Kevin.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.260
You sorry to see them leave?

09:12.360 --> 09:14.140
Actually, it's handy
Neil's going away.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.420
Give me a chance to get some
men in, to decorate his bedroom.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.100
- Virgin Atlantic flight VS301
- That's our flight.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.029
I am gonna miss you, petal.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.820
Oh...

09:23.920 --> 09:26.022
Yes, all right! Get off!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.502
Be very careful, little soldier, OK?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.180
- Your mum looks fit when she cries.
- Thank you.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.429
- I bet she looked amazing when your dad left.
- Brilliant.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.180
Off we went,
running away from our problems.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.700
All I knew about Australia
was that if it could bite you,

09:47.800 --> 09:49.100
sting you or eat you alive,

09:49.200 --> 09:51.029
then it probably lived there.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.500
But nothing had prepared us for
the beauty of Sydney Harbour.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.862
And Neil was particularly impressed.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.460
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

10:00.560 --> 10:03.380
- That fucking thing.
- The Sydney Opera House?

10:03.480 --> 10:06.060
No, that thing, the spaceship.
The spaceship, there.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.860
That's the sightseeing done.
We need to find this club.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.620
Hang on. Got a signal now.
Googlemappage to the rescue.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.470
It's this way.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.820
No way! That just cost me 20 quid.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.300
Data roaming charges are
pretty extortionate abroad.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.424
- Well, I'll just stand still, then.
- That's not really how it works.

10:24.184 --> 10:27.120
Another 20 quid? I'm not roaming now,
you useless piece of shit!

10:27.220 --> 10:29.229
- Just switch it off, Neil.
- Agh!

10:34.600 --> 10:38.140
- Thanks a lot, Si. It's fucked now.
- Not sure that was strictly my fault.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.540
We left the harbour to find Jay,

10:39.640 --> 10:42.700
to see if he really was getting
sucked off every morning.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.380
Cannot wait to see DJ
Big Penis rocking da house.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.582
No, nor can I.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.460
Ever taken a backpack or
a suitcase to a nightclub?

10:54.560 --> 10:57.630
No, of course you haven't.
Because you're not a fucking idiot.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.740
Hey!

11:00.840 --> 11:02.942
<i>Let me take a selfie</i>

11:07.280 --> 11:08.620
We had nowhere to stay

11:08.720 --> 11:12.620
and, surprisingly, Big Penis wasn't
the club's premier number one DJ.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.231
<i>Let me take a selfie</i>

11:18.520 --> 11:20.220
I don't get it.
He said he worked here.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.780
He also said he knocked out a
koala and fucked the Minogues.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.100
- Legend.
- He's not here.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.580
Have to spend the night in a hostel.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.940
Aren't hostels a bit pikey?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.820
Hostels are how
everyone does it, Simon.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.420
Full of interesting people
who are travelling, like us.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.260
I don't know. We visited Uncle Paul
in a hostel when he had cancer.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.980
Wasn't very cool if I'm being honest.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.580
- It also wasn't a hostel.
- Fine.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.700
- If it's only one night, I suppose.
- Yeah.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.020
- Least there might be some sexy nurses.
- There won't be.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.665
Quick pizzle first?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.307
That's it, sir.
Wash your fingers for the mingers.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.660
No splash, no gash.
No Armani, no punani.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.431
No Dolce & Gabbana,
no sucky your banana.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.540
- Jay! Jay!
- Oh, fuck.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.460
- Jay?
- No, pal, the name's Bruce.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.260
What? Shut up, Jay.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.300
Sorry, I've never heard
of this bloke Jay.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.740
Oh, it's clearly not him. Let's go.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.140
- So you're not Jay?
- It's Bruce, you fucking drongo.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.660
- But you've got Jay's face.
- Nah.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.180
And your sign says
"Jay's Pussay Juice... dollar a squirt."

12:15.280 --> 12:18.782
- Coincidence.
- What's happened to Jay? Is this a wind-up?

12:20.800 --> 12:22.743
Course it's a bloody wind-up!

12:24.320 --> 12:25.940
100% merked.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.540
The looks on your faces.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.300
You prize bellends.
I can't believe you fell for that.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.940
- We didn't.
- It is you, Jay!

12:32.040 --> 12:34.063
Epic bants!

12:35.240 --> 12:36.910
All right, Neil, calm down.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.260
Good to see you, man.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.500
Just to clear one thing up, though.
You do work in a toilet, don't you?

12:42.600 --> 12:45.180
I can see going to uni hasn't
made you any less of a retard.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.100
Course I don't work
in a fucking toilet.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.900
Why are you working
in a toilet, then?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.340
It's a joke!

12:50.440 --> 12:53.460
Don't worry, it probably went
over your heads. Whoosh.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.060
I run this whole club.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.980
- I'm my own boss.
- Boss of a toilet.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.670
Well, drinks are on you, then.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.260
- What, now?
- Yeah, now.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.020
Yeah, great, perfect.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.992
Jay's story made complete sense.
If I ran a nightclub,

13:06.092 --> 13:09.140
I'd definitely dress like a snooker
player and hang out in the toilets.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.540
I cannot wait to hear the mad
bants you've been having.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.020
Oh, mate, the bants in
Australia are legendary.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.980
Cos I've been delivering
most of the bants.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.340
- I'm like Banta Claus.
- I've got bants.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.820
- Nudgies.
- You twat!

13:19.920 --> 13:21.220
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.502
Oh, my God!

13:25.200 --> 13:27.140
Oh, what? You don't
recognise me, do you?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.380
Katie?

13:28.480 --> 13:31.700
- Katie Evans from prep school?
- Maybe you do remember.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.540
I'll never forget that sleepover
we had at Lloydie's house.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.780
- I don't remember that.
- No, nor me.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.980
How amazing to see you.
What an incredibly small world.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.660
I don't know. Seems like every
kid from the Home Counties

13:41.760 --> 13:44.420
- is out here doing a gap year.
- Yeah, what a cliché.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.820
- So what are you up to?
- I'm doing a gap year.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.180
The standard. India once,
India twice.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.300
Love, heartbreak, silent retreat.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.180
Thailand, scuba diving, broken foot.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.500
Nepal, volunteering, volcanoes.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.620
Indonesia, healers, reiki,
cafes, tears, revelations,

14:00.720 --> 14:02.940
amazing people,
amazing conversations.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.300
Unforgettable and life-changing
experiences. You?

14:06.400 --> 14:08.662
I'm visiting my friend
who works in a toilet.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.380
You always made me laugh, you nutter.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.300
- What are you really doing?
- Travelling.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.780
- Out here for four weeks.
- Oh, so you're on holiday.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.700
No, travelling, I think.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.020
What have you been up to without me?
Must have been shit.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.700
- I've been at uni.
- That's bent.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.620
What about you?
Been getting your dick wet?

14:24.720 --> 14:26.940
- I went swimming.
- No, with fanny juice.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.500
Oh, right. Er, no, not really.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.860
I worked in the garage.
Now I'm working in the bank.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.740
- Oh, you know your cousin Michelle?
- Yeah.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.380
- I fingered her.
- Neil.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.620
Tell me you're not staying
in Sydney, are you?

14:36.720 --> 14:38.900
- It's so banker.
- No.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.500
I'm going to...

14:40.600 --> 14:43.460
- Er, where is it you're going?
- Byron Bay. It is awesome.

14:43.560 --> 14:48.780
I've got a job there selling excursions,
like white-water rafting, zip lining, bungee.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.180
I was actually just flyering to raise
some cash for the bus tomorrow.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.420
Oh, well, it's been nice to see you.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.100
What? I haven't seen you in ages.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.140
- Why don't you come to Byron?
- You're inviting me?

15:00.240 --> 15:03.020
Of course I'm inviting you.
Come to Byron.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.580
Look, you would love the vibe.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.180
It's so you. It's just totally chill.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.460
Really, I'd love to,
but I'll have to ask the others.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.140
I'll convince them.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.100
- Is that them over there?
- No, no.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.740
That's not them.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.620
But I'm sure my actual
friends will be up for it.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.020
Yay! Amazing!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.587
Right, well, I will see
you tomorrow, then.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.342
- What?
- Nothing.

15:26.640 --> 15:29.500
- See you later... alligator.
- Love it.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.350
I'll see you on the bus tomorrow.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.380
- Who was that?
- Katie Evans from junior school.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.700
- Definitely my first love.
- That is well Jimmy Savile.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.700
- Just an old friend.
- That you wanna have sex with.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.300
She might wanna have sex with me.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.540
- She kissed me on the lips.
- Tongues?

15:44.640 --> 15:46.140
- No, but...
- No, that don't count.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.860
- My mum used to kiss me on the lips.
- When you were a child.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.460
Couldn't have done it any other time.
She ran off when he was ten.

15:51.560 --> 15:54.140
Girls don't kiss people on
the lips they don't fancy.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.940
She's one of those mouth-kissing girls.
I've met loads at uni.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.620
- Have you?
- I met one and then Lucy punched her.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.700
I'm not surprised Briefcase
has had a sniff.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.340
Australia is the sex capital of
the world. That's why I'm here.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.980
They call it down under cos that's where
your face spends most of the time.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.220
- Banter.
- I've spent plenty of time in the bush.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.140
- The bush around the pussays.
- Bants.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.300
Check these out. My new bants.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.540
Hashtag mad bants.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.140
- I'm the Archbishop of Banterbury.
- Bantom of the Opera.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.420
- I don't get it.
- Whoosh.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.620
Bant and Dec.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.260
- Someone needs tickets to the bantomime.
- Eric Bantona.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.540
Just saying "banter" or
"bants" over and over again

16:26.640 --> 16:29.020
is not a substitute for
actual amusing conversation.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.337
Briefcase banter.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.943
Jay, what are you doing? Your shift
doesn't end for another four hours.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.380
- Good one, Lizzie.
- Get back to work.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.902
Yeah, I'll tell you what, you pretend
to be my boss. It'll be hilarious.

16:42.920 --> 16:43.980
Anyway, we'd better go.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.700
Take one step outside that door,
you're fucking sacked.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.220
You mean you're sacked.
I just sacked you.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.820
- Don't play the prick. You can't sack me.
- Just did, mate.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.660
I'll see you later.
I've gotta go home.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.180
Don't think we can't find another bottom
feeder to wipe piss off people's hands.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.620
Good one, Lizzie.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.420
I can't wait to see the mansion.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.385
- Can I have a room with a hot tub?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.579
So this is the mansion?

17:05.680 --> 17:07.500
A tent in your uncle's front garden?

17:07.599 --> 17:10.540
It's only temporary. My new fuck
pad is still under construction.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.700
In your mind.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.140
I can't believe I've travelled
literally halfway round the world

17:15.240 --> 17:17.619
to spend a month in a two-man tent.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.060
Jay?

17:19.160 --> 17:22.230
- Did you sweep that veranda this morning?
- Yes, Uncle Bryan.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.260
Who are these pale little bastards?

17:25.359 --> 17:27.819
- You butt-fucking boys in your tent?
- No, Uncle Bryan.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.300
These are my friends from England.
Simon and Neil.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.500
- And...?
- And Will.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.980
Uncle Bryan, Cousin Shane.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.460
- How's Australia treating you fellas?
- Oh, what a place. So interesting...

17:37.560 --> 17:39.660
Greatest fucking country on Earth.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.460
I keep telling Jay that he should move here,
but he won't. Too much of a pussy,

17:43.560 --> 17:46.540
which is a shame, cos we could do with
some white immigration for a change.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.740
Right.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.820
Jay told us about the
sheilas he's been shagging.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.060
Has he? Well, that's bullshit.
Closest this little runt's come to some vag

17:53.160 --> 17:55.180
is when the dog dripped
period down his leg.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.980
- Don't pretend you didn't get a boner.
- Good one, Bry.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.020
- What's that?
- Nothing, Uncle Bryan.

18:00.120 --> 18:04.940
Hey, some nights for shits and giggles,
me and Shano shine a torch through the tent,

18:05.040 --> 18:09.270
we can see him sitting up, all silhouetted
like, bashing away on his little platypus.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.420
You understand when I say
platypus I mean cock?

18:12.520 --> 18:14.020
- Yeah.
- And guess what?

18:14.120 --> 18:16.916
He's gone and dug a hole
in the ground to fuck.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.500
I'm just kidding. It's a wormhole,
cos his dick's so small. Get it?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.980
But I'm not kidding about the hole,
he has got that, and a small dick,

18:24.080 --> 18:26.023
which he fucks the hole
in the ground with.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.500
Right.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.100
- We should put our stuff in the tent.
- Yeah, all right. I'll see youse later.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.302
Hey, careful you don't
fall in the fuck hole.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.580
- He's nice, isn't he?
- He's all right. He's just...

18:38.680 --> 18:40.180
- Australian?
- Yeah.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.900
It's pretty obvious we can't
stay in here for four weeks.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.260
I propose we go travelling.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.180
Oh, my gosh. Think of the bants!

18:46.280 --> 18:48.220
If we're travelling,
there's only one place to go.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.540
Ooh. Uluru?

18:49.640 --> 18:51.500
The Great Barrier Reef?
Fraser Island?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.780
No, none of that boring shit.
Splash Planet.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.500
- I'm sorry?
- Splash Planet.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.940
The whole of Australia and you're
suggesting we visit a water park?

18:59.040 --> 19:02.300
If you hadn't spent the last six months
at uni wanking off to Shakespeare,

19:02.400 --> 19:05.340
you'd know that water parks are
the ultimate place to fuck girls.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.500
Scientists have proved the water pressure
on their clitties gives them such a wide-on,

19:09.600 --> 19:11.820
when they get off the rides,
they're gagging for it.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.900
- No word of a lie.
- Some word of a lie.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.940
Where did the scientists get their
funding from? The University of Sex?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.340
Oh, fuck off!

19:18.440 --> 19:21.700
Fucking leave me alone! Can I not have
one fucking day without you abusing me?

19:21.800 --> 19:25.507
- Is that your mum?
- No, Lucy. She's burnt my trainers.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.540
You need to end it, Si.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.140
I know. I know.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.860
Get your dad to text her, tell her
you've died. That's what I do.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.100
Right. I think at least I
need to tell her to her face.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.900
My uncle's got Skype.
Go and dump the nightmare now.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.780
That's unfair. You don't know her.
Though she is a fucking nightmare.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.460
- I'll do it, Si.
- No, it's all right. I'm going.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.340
- Wish me luck.
- Bad luck.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.190
Close enough.

19:50.546 --> 19:51.660
Yo.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.020
- Hey! Beer?
- No, thanks.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.580
Is it OK to use the computer?

19:55.680 --> 19:56.940
Yeah, course it is, mate.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.347
Jay's always on there chubby chasing.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.620
OK, I've worked it out.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.940
We wanna go travelling,
you wanna go to Splash Planet,

20:11.040 --> 20:13.420
which means the best place
to stay is here, Byron Bay.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.820
Oh, where mouth-kiss bird is?

20:14.920 --> 20:18.580
It's 20 minutes outside Splash Planet,
on the beach, there's loads of cool hostels

20:18.680 --> 20:20.820
and it's easy to get jobs
should we need money.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.420
I've always wanted to
be a dolphin trainer.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.700
- Have you?
- You should go to Splash Planet.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.660
- You'll get that job there.
- You won't.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.220
Look, we're English, right?

20:28.320 --> 20:32.140
Just finishing school in England makes us
ten times cleverer than any Australian.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.860
We're like doctors or rocket scientists
over here. You can get any job you want.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.300
- Even dolphin trainer?
- Course.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.740
Turn up, tell 'em your English.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.060
I am 100% certain that is not how
you get a job as a dolphin trainer.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.180
Who's been living in Australia
for months? Me, that's who.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.260
Yes, in a tent.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.220
You calling your mummy
for a good night kiss?

20:49.320 --> 20:51.500
Oh, no, I have...
I have to Skype my girlfriend.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.225
You got a girlfriend?

20:54.863 --> 20:58.140
Well done, mate. Looking at you,
no offence, I'm amazed.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.980
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.182
I'll be the judge of that.
Give us a look at her.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.940
Fuck me dead, she's gorgeous, mate.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.340
- Oh, right. Yeah, I suppose so.
- Suppose?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.820
Mate, if that was my sheila,
I wouldn't leave her side.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.100
- You're getting married, right?
- No.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.540
No? Fuck me, mate.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.020
Look at that. Then look at you.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.140
You could live to be a billion,
you'll never get a root better than that.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.660
We sometimes argue a bit,
and we're quite young.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.020
Cash your chips, mate.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.268
That's the best you'll get ever.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.820
At last. Where have you been?

21:26.920 --> 21:29.700
- I haven't heard from you in days.
- I've been on a plane.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.060
That was yesterday,
you fucking moron.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.820
Look, I think we need to talk.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.460
I've checked your emails.
They're clean for now.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.460
What's there to talk about?

21:38.560 --> 21:40.947
- Look, I wanted to say...
- Will you marry me?

21:41.680 --> 21:43.660
- What was that?
- No, no. What, what it was...

21:43.760 --> 21:44.940
Simon.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.666
- No, what it was was...
- Say it again.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.629
What, will you marry me?

21:53.240 --> 21:55.342
Yes! Yes!

21:56.200 --> 21:58.300
Oh, my God! I thought
you'd never ask.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.629
- No, wait a minute, Lucy...
- What? What?

22:04.560 --> 22:05.900
Nothing.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.174
I'm so happy.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.700
Oh, my God. Where's my...

22:12.800 --> 22:14.860
Where's my phone?
I need to ring people.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.903
Congratulations, mate.

22:18.876 --> 22:20.068
Where's my phone?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.923
Here he is.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.460
- Well?
- I can't go back home now.

22:26.560 --> 22:30.580
- She didn't take being dumped too well?
- Did not dump her. Have agreed to marry her.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.420
Oh, well done.

22:32.520 --> 22:33.780
You bellend!

22:33.880 --> 22:36.140
Genuine question: have I just
fucked up my entire life?

22:36.240 --> 22:39.580
Course not. Just cos you promise people
stuff doesn't mean you have to do it.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.420
I once told Comic Relief I'd raise three
million quid by selling selfies of my cock.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.780
- In the end, didn't bother.
- Right. I mean, I...

22:45.880 --> 22:48.420
- Not sure how that helps my situation.
- Make something up.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.220
The drive up to Byron's 12 hours.
We'll think of something.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.340
Drive? I thought we
were taking the bus.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.220
Fuck that. I've got a car.
Bought it off Cousin Shane.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.220
And considering it's an awesome
custom job, he done me a great deal.

22:59.320 --> 23:02.980
Let's sleep on it. I'd like to get the bus
but I'm sure we can reach a compromise.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.460
You're gonna keep talking
till we do what you want?

23:05.560 --> 23:06.821
No.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.990
Oh, I wouldn't sleep there, Simon.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.500
<i>Oh</i>

23:16.600 --> 23:18.060
<i>Oh oh ohhh</i>

23:18.160 --> 23:19.260
So, compromise reached,

23:19.360 --> 23:21.940
the next day we did what I wanted
and headed to the bus station,

23:22.040 --> 23:25.100
which was full of other cool
people travelling to Byron Bay.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.820
The Darien Gap is really all that's
left of untouched jungle in the world.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.500
- Yeah.
- I'm going to do South America.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.940
- I might try it.
- Yeah, you don't really try it.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.020
It's a five-day trek and you
only sleep in hammocks.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.340
Man, I got the shits so bad,

23:36.440 --> 23:39.140
they used up the whole group's
medical supplies treating me.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.660
It's so dangerous,
most guides won't even take you.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.740
- Yeah, I found that.
- Shame.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.380
So I walked it by myself,
unaccompanied, Panama to Colombia.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.780
Unaccompanied? I...

23:47.880 --> 23:49.820
- I thought that was illegal.
- It is, yeah,

23:49.920 --> 23:52.820
but it's better that way,
because you meet the real locals

23:52.920 --> 23:56.580
and there's none of that luxury bullshit
like hammocks and medical supplies.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.980
So if you do get the shits,
or malaria, like I did,

23:59.080 --> 24:01.460
then you just get on with it,
do you know what I mean?

24:01.560 --> 24:03.310
Wow. What an experience.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.500
Sounds incredible. Amazing stuff.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.429
I'm Will, by the way.

24:08.800 --> 24:12.746
You know, I used to have long hair too.
Not dreads, but pretty long.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.662
Yep. Had it all cut just
before we came out travelling.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.429
Well, that's an interesting story.

24:21.310 --> 24:24.910
Will, you made it.
Byron, here we come.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.380
So you've met the rest of the gang?

24:27.480 --> 24:30.940
We were chatting about South America,
my experiments with hair styles and shit.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.220
Classic travelling shit.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.620
I got you that McFlurry.
Jay says get a fucking move on.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.980
- Oh, so are you guys travelling too?
- Yeah.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.380
Yeah. It's my second
foreign holiday in a year.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.620
- First we all went Malia.
- We went ironically.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.780
It was brilliant.
They had jet skis you could rent.

24:43.880 --> 24:44.980
Wow. Do tell us more.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.467
They're like motorbikes
without wheels but on water.

24:51.537 --> 24:52.840
Good one!

24:54.280 --> 24:56.420
- I'm Neil Sutherland as it goes.
- Ben.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.220
- Is that your whole name?
- No.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.741
Does it matter?
It's Ben Thornton-Wilde.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.100
- Which one?
- What?

25:03.200 --> 25:05.460
- Thornton or Wilde?
- It's double-barrelled.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.460
Choose one depending
on how you're feeling?

25:07.560 --> 25:10.140
No, no, those...
those are both my last name.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.140
What? Shut up.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.303
That is mental. Will,
Ben here has got two last names,

25:15.403 --> 25:18.049
but it's actually just one name.
Have you heard of that?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.900
Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of that.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.546
Koala Coaches departure
to Byron Bay...

25:23.800 --> 25:25.311
Finally.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.420
Departing now at stand 14.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.540
- Are you coming, then?
- Me? Oh, no.

25:30.640 --> 25:33.820
- I thought you were coming north with me.
- I am, just not on the bus.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.860
My friends wanted to
travel by car, so...

25:35.960 --> 25:39.860
So you've been waiting at a bus
station for ages in your backpack

25:39.960 --> 25:41.869
even though you're going by car?

25:42.640 --> 25:45.903
- That's a bit weird, isn't it?
- Yeah. See you in Byron.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.420
So off we went. We didn't know
exactly how to get to Byron Bay.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.460
So we just followed the
bus that Katie was on,

25:53.560 --> 25:55.662
perhaps a little too closely.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.860
She looks well freaked out.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.666
- Might it have anything to do with the car?
- Doubt it.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.660
- A few questions about the car...
- Fire away.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.900
One: just why did you buy it?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.340
I needed a cool set of wheels
and Shano did me a deal.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.380
Two: is Shano a big Peter Andre fan?

26:16.480 --> 26:18.620
Shane's not stupid.
The birds love Peter Andre.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.380
Not sure anyone loves anything
enough to have sex with Shano.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.620
What are you talking about?

26:22.720 --> 26:25.140
He got so much anal in here,
I had to hose down the footwell.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.540
This is the classic
Aussie Shaggin' Wagon.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.060
- Is it?
- It's the fuck truck.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.700
- The mobile virgin conversion unit.
- We should use it on Will.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.954
Brilliant.

26:37.880 --> 26:41.580
I can't wait to get a job training dolphins,
even though it's bad how they're treated.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.700
Did you know, all they
feed 'em is raw fish?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.420
Oh, that is grim.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.220
I'd puke if all I ate was fish.
That is bang out of order.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.260
- Imagine it, just raw fish.
- Their diet is fish.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.740
- Yeah, cos that's all they're given.
- But also because that's what they eat.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.940
It's so cruel, you know.

26:56.040 --> 27:00.460
No burgers, no KFC, no Nando's on
birthdays, nothing. How would you like it?

27:00.560 --> 27:03.260
Well, if all I ate was fish,
I probably wouldn't mind it.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.140
All right, yes or no, how would
you like to just eat raw fish?

27:06.240 --> 27:07.420
Well, if I was a dolphin...

27:07.520 --> 27:09.140
- Yes or no?
- You can't compare...

27:09.240 --> 27:10.940
- Yes or no?
- They're marine biologists.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.500
- Yes or no?
- It's not as simple as...

27:12.600 --> 27:14.065
Only raw fish, yes or no?

27:14.520 --> 27:16.782
- No!
- Correct.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.421
"Bryan Bay", next left.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.060
Finally, we made it to Byron Bay,
and I'd never seen anywhere like it.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.740
It was buzzing with life,

27:35.840 --> 27:39.342
or in Jay's opinion,
absolutely rammed full of bellends.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.420
But if there was one place where a car
featuring Peter Andre and a pair of tits

27:43.520 --> 27:44.780
wouldn't raise an eyebrow,

27:44.880 --> 27:46.982
it was the Arts Factory Lodge hostel.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.780
OK, Jay. Please park the car
where no-one can see it.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.106
No.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.740
Oh, Ben. Ben, mate!

27:56.840 --> 27:59.820
- Man. I meant "man".
- Hey, guys. How's the holiday?

27:59.920 --> 28:01.940
What's on the tourist
itinerary for tomorrow?

28:02.040 --> 28:03.940
Ha! That's funny.
You know we're not tourists.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.980
- Splash Planet.
- I'm gonna work with dolphins.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.389
- Start at the bottom, work my way up.
- Like father, like son.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.580
His dad's bent.

28:12.680 --> 28:16.020
I'll begin with the easy stuff,
cleaning out their cages and that.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.500
So participating in the
enslavement of animals. Wow.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.749
- Have you heard of ethically travelling?
- Is that with Ryan Gosling?

28:22.240 --> 28:23.980
OK, er... we'll see you around.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.300
Yeah, great.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.420
- When?
- What?

28:27.520 --> 28:29.460
Oh, I just wondered when
you'd see us around.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.300
Is there a good time?

28:31.400 --> 28:33.900
- It's a figure of speech.
- Cool. Catch you later, mate.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.102
Mate? Man. Man.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.380
He's all right, isn't he?

28:39.480 --> 28:41.503
No, not really.

28:44.680 --> 28:49.100
The hostel was laid-back, cool and the
kind of place where anything goes.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.871
Anything except,
it seemed, deodorant.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.910
Smells a bit in here.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.711
Shotgun.

28:56.060 --> 28:58.022
Unlucky. Top-bunk wankers.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.300
Oh, fuck off, Neil. I want some hottie
above me, not your rotting arsehole.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.660
I just wanna be near you.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.340
I've been thinking. Do we really
need to go to Splash Planet?

29:06.440 --> 29:07.740
Yes. Yes, we do.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.420
But it's so tacky and
gaudy and full of idiots.

29:10.520 --> 29:13.420
- It's my lifetime's ambition.
- You first mentioned it yesterday.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.020
- Don't kill my dreams, Will.
- Oh! Hello, nutter.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.580
You made it.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.340
So, er, what are you up
to tomorrow? Any plans?

29:20.440 --> 29:25.420
We thought we might travel somewhere
ethical, an Aboriginal... cave.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.700
That's a shame.
I'm going to Splash Planet.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.420
It looks brilliant.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.900
It does, doesn't it?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.340
- You just said it was tacky.
- What? Shut up.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.500
You said it was full of idiots.
Are you an idiot, Katie?

29:35.600 --> 29:37.700
They're being funny.
Stop being so funny, you guys.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.900
Well, I must be an idiot, then,
because I think it looks amazing.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.420
I can get you tickets if you like.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.940
Really? Fantastic.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.580
- Four, please.
- Cool. Done.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.940
Right, I'm gonna go and sit
by the fire. Fancy coming?

29:48.040 --> 29:50.620
Yeah. I just need to Skype home first.
My mother worries.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.426
Crazy. Right, well,
I'll see you in a bit, then.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.220
- You all right?
- Wait, I'm thinking.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.626
- About what?
- Wait.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.940
What is it?

30:02.040 --> 30:05.383
Has anyone ever said anything less cool
to a girl than "My mother worries"?

30:07.080 --> 30:07.954
"Bye."

30:09.480 --> 30:13.260
Splash Planet wasn't one of the great
Australian tourist attractions

30:13.360 --> 30:15.383
but it did have one
sight I wanted to see.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.420
Katie in a bikini.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.305
First, I just had to Skype
the other woman in my life.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.380
- Really?
- I haven't seen your mum for six months.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.300
I need to refresh the
image in the wank bank.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.060
Surely watching Simon dump Lucy
has to be more fun than this.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.500
Nothing's more fun than your mum.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.580
Hello, darling. I can't see you.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.340
Yeah, you've not got your
video on, same as every time.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.540
- Where's the button?
- Where it always is.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.061
Where I have to point you
every single time we Skype.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.060
Then move the camera down, remember?

30:45.160 --> 30:47.580
- What camera?
- Come on. We've done this.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.260
The camera. It's on
top of the laptop.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.060
- Just tip the lid forward.
- How's that?

30:52.160 --> 30:53.340
- Move it up!
- Perfect.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.580
Oh, is that Neil?

30:54.680 --> 30:57.380
- Can you both just fuck off?
- Don't be rude to your friends.

30:57.480 --> 31:01.301
- He gets grump grumps when he gets tired.
- Just move the camera back.

31:03.760 --> 31:04.820
Finally.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.540
Look, I just wanted to check in,
tell you I've met some great new people...

31:08.640 --> 31:10.460
Oh, is... is Grandma staying over?

31:10.560 --> 31:11.860
No. Why would you say that?

31:11.960 --> 31:14.740
You've got two bowls and
two mugs out for breakfast.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.020
Oh, yes, so I have.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.340
So who's staying over?

31:17.440 --> 31:18.580
Your grandma.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.740
You just said she wasn't.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.660
Did I?

31:22.760 --> 31:24.700
Think it must be
the connection, darling.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.580
Yeah, terrible connection.
You're breaking up.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.782
I love you. Speak soon.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.100
She's getting fucked, I reckon.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.260
Meanwhile, it was second
time lucky for Simon.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.900
The only way this Skype with Lucy
could go worse than the first

31:41.000 --> 31:42.700
was if he somehow got her pregnant.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.180
Hello, baby boo. I love you.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.860
- Lucy?
- Come on.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.980
- Now you say it.
- No.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.100
Look, there's something
I need to do right now.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.900
- Put it away. There are elderly people present.
- What the fuck?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.180
Popped round to see our
new daughter-in-law.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.860
Simon, we're so delighted for you.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.700
You'll have to start planning
as soon as you get back.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.020
- Thanks for stating the fucking obvious.
- Oi, this is a happy occasion.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.660
It's OK. It's an emotional time.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.820
Come on, Pam,
let's leave these love birds to it.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.860
Don't you two get carried away.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.980
Me and Mum have seen plenty of videos
that start like this on the internet. Plenty.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.670
Alan, please.

32:18.440 --> 32:19.820
They're so nice.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.624
They're fucking idiots.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.140
We've all agreed on
a date, so that's good.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.860
- You've set a date?
- And I've got all my bridesmaids sorted.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.140
I just hope Jane will
come back from Australia.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.180
No, Lucy, I'm in Australia,
not Jane, remember?

32:32.280 --> 32:34.700
I'm not fucking senile, Simon.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.940
I know you're there. She's there too.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.180
- Why didn't you mention it?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.740
I forgot I'm meant to give you
minute-by-minute updates

32:41.840 --> 32:42.980
on my friends' movements.

32:43.080 --> 32:46.620
OK, so Suzanne is moving in with Steve
because she's missed her period.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.900
And Louise is back in Coventry
because she's self-harming again.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.864
Is that enough detail?

32:52.200 --> 32:54.064
Yes, that's great, thank you.

32:58.280 --> 33:02.100
The vibe at the hostel was incredible and
it was clear we weren't at home any more.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.380
Things were different,

33:03.480 --> 33:06.540
and it was nice to see that Simon,
Neil and especially Jay

33:06.640 --> 33:08.700
were embracing this new environment.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.260
Oh, no! Why is there always
some cunt with a guitar?

33:11.360 --> 33:13.260
If anyone starts playing
the bongos, I'm leaving.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.460
If the bongos start,
I'm burning the place down.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.700
Open your minds, guys.
We're backpacking now.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.140
- Get into the backpacking vibe.
- Vibe?

33:20.240 --> 33:22.620
We're by a fire listening to
some posh prick play guitar.

33:22.720 --> 33:25.710
- How much more backpacking can it get?
- Please don't ruin this for me.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.826
Katie.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.181
Nudgies.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.140
- Enjoy the trip?
- Are you OK?

33:33.240 --> 33:36.310
Yep. Yep. Totally fine.
Good one, man.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.900
- Looks like you've got front-row seats.
- Yeah. Lucky me.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.580
At least you're here to
cheer me up, though. Hi.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.140
Katie, can I play you a song?

33:46.240 --> 33:47.620
No, I'm good, thanks.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.940
God, that guy can be such a dick.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.500
- Really?
- Yeah. Look at him.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.420
He always has to be
the centre of attention.

33:54.520 --> 33:58.260
How can anyone wear that many friendship
bracelets? No-one has that many friends.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.900
How is giving a stinking piece
of string a show of friendship?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.865
I know, right? I mean,
I only wear, what, like seven.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.740
Actually, I made one for you.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.306
- D'you want it?
- Yeah, great. I love these.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.791
OK, Katie, this is your last chance.
What can I play for you?

34:14.040 --> 34:15.551
How about The Sound Of Silence?

34:21.800 --> 34:23.620
What the fuck?

34:23.719 --> 34:26.300
Oh, Jay, you know Jane's
in Australia, right?

34:26.600 --> 34:28.980
- What? Who?
- The fat bird that dumped you.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.420
She did not fucking dump me, Neil.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.620
- But you cried.
- Tears of joy probably.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.820
Well, Lucy told me
Jane's here in Australia.

34:34.920 --> 34:36.431
So? Like I give a shit.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.580
- Weird, though. Amazing coincidence.
- Maybe she's come to get you back.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.900
She should be so lucky. You know
the first rule of Banter Brigade.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.940
- You're only allowed one fatty?
- Ha!

34:46.040 --> 34:48.820
No, that... that is a very
funny joke, though, but no.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.659
What is it again? I know it,
but I've just forgotten for a minute.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.380
- All the Fs...
- Oh, yeah.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.100
Find 'em, fuck 'em, forget 'em.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.340
No, Neil. All the Fs.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.620
Find 'em, Frenchy 'em,
get 'em frothy,

34:59.720 --> 35:00.980
finger 'em, frig 'em,

35:01.080 --> 35:03.340
film 'em, flange 'em, flick 'em,

35:03.440 --> 35:05.660
fanny fart 'em, fuck 'em, frot 'em,

35:05.760 --> 35:09.180
fist 'em, felch 'em, finish with 'em
and then finally forget about 'em.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.820
Just like what I done with Jane,
or whatever her name was.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.660
Sorry, I switched off after "frig".

35:13.760 --> 35:16.060
You aren't bothered
about Jane being here?

35:16.160 --> 35:17.180
No.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.620
Did you know that laughter
is intensely spiritual?

35:20.720 --> 35:22.740
So that means that
you're very spiritual.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.820
Would you say you're spiritual?

35:25.920 --> 35:28.180
It's quite a vague way to
describe a whole person.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.269
Could you just narrow it down at all?

35:31.520 --> 35:36.660
So, what I'm saying, right,
is that I think you're spiritual.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.100
Yep, and I'm saying that's great...

35:39.200 --> 35:43.700
really great, but what do you mean?
Don't wanna sign up for something I'm not.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.902
Oh... OK.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.460
Actually, I've had a think
about it and I am spiritual.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.380
I knew it! Do you wanna get drunk?

35:53.480 --> 35:55.344
On goon? Yes, please.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.260
Did you really not know
Jane was in Australia?

35:59.360 --> 36:00.580
Don't talk bollocks, Si.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.100
If I'd have known that,
why would I have come here?

36:03.200 --> 36:05.780
Because you wanna get her back?
Because you miss her?

36:11.760 --> 36:15.180
- Is your lip all right?
- Yep.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.580
She's at the water park, isn't she?
That's why you wanna go.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.620
I made a mistake, all right?

36:19.720 --> 36:21.740
I made a mistake and I'm
trying to make it better.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.220
- Why didn't you see her before?
- I was building up to it.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.940
And now you're here, I'm gonna do it.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.740
So just don't fucking tell anyone.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.580
- Tell anyone what?
- About your dad's world record.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.750
- My dad's got a world record?
- Yeah. Most dogs' cocks in one mouth.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.700
Hey, hey, hey! It's the dudes.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.060
How are we, dudes?

36:39.160 --> 36:42.070
Am I right in thinking my young
friends might be up for a little...?

36:43.800 --> 36:46.221
Darts? I don't think
they've got a board.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.500
You guys are so funny.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.943
No. Anyone mind if I skin up? As if.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.700
See, Stephen?

36:54.800 --> 36:57.187
Nobody fucking minds!

36:58.240 --> 37:01.344
That's right, run away from our
problems like you always do.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.380
Oh, fuck.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.060
Oh, fucking leave me alone.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.180
Oh, God, do I really have
to marry that lunatic?

37:10.280 --> 37:12.860
Well, I asked her, so, yes, I have.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.340
God, how has this happened?

37:14.440 --> 37:15.985
Marriage woes, yeah?

37:17.280 --> 37:20.031
Dr Doobs prescribes a
toke of Jesper's finest.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.829
A friend with weed
is a friend indeed.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.660
All right, cheers.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.940
- Si.
- What? I'm a fucking mess.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.869
She's cutting up all my hoodies.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.189
Oh, God.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.744
Yes.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.380
Ooh.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.220
Fucking hell, mate,
you are the full package.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.940
You're funny and spiritual.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.860
I can't believe you're single.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.267
It is hard to believe,
but I am single.

37:49.820 --> 37:52.700
I never know when you're
joking and when you're not.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.586
But, let me tell you, if you could play
guitar, I would jump you right now.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.020
Actually, I can play guitar.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.460
Fuck off!

38:03.560 --> 38:05.620
I've had a lot of time on
my own at uni to practise.

38:05.720 --> 38:09.063
Fucking knockout!
Go on, then, mate. Give us a song.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.270
OK.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.870
Hey, Ben, man, can I have a go, man?

38:20.360 --> 38:22.300
Wow.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.580
Well, you don't really
have a go with a guitar.

38:24.680 --> 38:27.340
It's... Not in front of
this many people, you know.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.146
I just wanna play a song for
a friend, for... for Katie.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.300
- Sure you've got this?
- Yeah, I think so.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.460
- It's quite a lot of people...
- I can handle it.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.820
- OK, well, just go for it, man.
- I'm trying to.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.580
Just take the guitar.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.545
Remove your hand from the
neck of the guitar, then.

38:44.400 --> 38:47.071
Thank you. Thanks, man.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.900
This is a... slight change
of mood but

39:00.000 --> 39:01.670
Yeah, hope you like it.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.381
<i>The first time</i>

39:08.120 --> 39:13.021
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

39:14.240 --> 39:15.420
What is he doing?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.500
<i>I thought the sun</i>

39:17.600 --> 39:18.860
It's weird. I don't like it.

39:18.960 --> 39:24.066
<i>Rose in your eyes</i>

39:26.560 --> 39:30.460
<i>And the moon and the stars...</i>

39:30.560 --> 39:32.940
I'm trying to stop watching,
but I can't.

39:33.040 --> 39:37.748
<i>Were the gifts you gave</i>

39:38.200 --> 39:42.100
<i>To the dark</i>

39:43.600 --> 39:47.227
<i>And the empty sky</i>

39:54.120 --> 39:57.224
<i>And the first time</i>

39:57.400 --> 40:02.270
<i>Ever I kissed your mouth</i>

40:02.800 --> 40:06.260
<i>I felt your heart</i>

40:06.360 --> 40:12.183
<i>So close to mine</i>

40:12.600 --> 40:14.589
Right, well, I'm going to bed.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.620
Neil, you coming?

40:16.720 --> 40:18.629
No, I might wait a bit.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.820
<i>The first time</i>

40:27.920 --> 40:32.150
<i>Ever I saw</i>

40:32.640 --> 40:34.310
<i>Your face</i>

40:35.880 --> 40:37.948
<i>Your face</i>

40:38.200 --> 40:40.302
<i>Your face</i>

40:40.680 --> 40:42.703
<i>Your face</i>

40:43.000 --> 40:47.469
<i>Your face</i>

40:48.360 --> 40:49.871
Your face.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.780
Oh. This is very nice.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.300
Is it a little bit public?

40:57.400 --> 40:59.540
No-one cares.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.584
Ooh. Hello. I sort of care.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.340
Should we be doing this here?

41:04.440 --> 41:06.740
This is what travelling's about.
Now, get in bed.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.380
I'm on the top bunk.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.470
Look, you just lie
there and I'll ride you.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.540
Oh, what is this?

41:15.640 --> 41:17.300
That's very hard.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.628
Sorry. Let me get
that out of the way.

41:24.080 --> 41:27.020
This is someone else's bed. Let's get
on my bunk. It's just up there.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.063
You're so sexy.

41:35.040 --> 41:38.580
Katie, this is great,
but you're very drunk.

41:38.680 --> 41:41.100
Why don't we get a hotel
for tomorrow? My treat.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.302
- Anything. You're gorgeous.
- Ssh.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.780
Nah.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.940
What? You're no fun!

41:52.040 --> 41:53.340
I am. I am fun.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.542
It's just... here?

41:55.800 --> 41:58.426
Come on, let's have fun here.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.220
Yeah, do it like that.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.422
That's nice.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.069
Yeah.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.022
Your friend is asleep on my bed.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.861
Now, this is not what it looks like.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.665
You piece of shit!

42:33.240 --> 42:35.780
After I'd explained to everyone
that it was my rape alarm,

42:35.880 --> 42:38.820
and once they'd stopped laughing,
we got some sleep.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.420
The next morning, Simon was
the first person in history

42:41.520 --> 42:44.260
to get the munchies ten
hours after smoking a joint.

42:44.360 --> 42:45.820
- You two not having breakfast?
- No.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.780
I've got irritable bowel syndrome.
Gets worse when I get stressed.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.580
I'm finding travelling stressful.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.940
You should have seen me
sweating in the toilet block.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.180
It's not even runny. It's just like
massive ones firing 'emselves out.

42:56.280 --> 42:58.060
This foreign muck I'm
eating don't help.

42:58.160 --> 43:01.020
- You've only eaten McDonald's.
- Yeah, Australian McDonald's.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.740
- Good morning.
- Here he is, the singing sex pest.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.620
Say what you like. The song worked.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.060
- Someone had a good night.
- Yes.

43:07.160 --> 43:09.860
After the unpleasantness
with Agnetha was sorted out.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.020
I think we have to call
last night a success.

43:12.120 --> 43:14.900
A beautiful girl wants to have
sex with me. Oh, and there she is.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.829
Yoo-hoo! Katie!

43:17.360 --> 43:19.700
Katie! Katie!

43:19.800 --> 43:21.980
Fucking hell, mate.
There's no need to shout.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.023
Goon hangovers are the worst.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.228
Look, it's all right, mate.
I can walk.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.820
God, I was so pissed last night.

43:30.920 --> 43:32.260
You were a little. You passed out.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.540
- I remember, like, an alarm or something?
- Yeah, don't worry about that.

43:35.640 --> 43:39.740
Apart from that I literally cannot
remember a single thing that happened.

43:39.840 --> 43:43.540
It goes straight from sitting round
the fire to puking this morning.

43:43.640 --> 43:44.820
Oh.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.830
Oh, my God. Did we?

43:48.280 --> 43:49.780
Well, sort of.

43:49.880 --> 43:51.420
- We fucked?
- No.

43:51.520 --> 43:52.860
- Did we kiss?
- Yes.

43:54.839 --> 43:57.420
Oh, my God! That is so funny.

43:57.520 --> 44:00.146
- Isn't that funny?
- A bit.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.865
God, I'm so bad when I'm drunk.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.140
- Bad?
- Oh, no, no, not in that way.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.420
Not that you're not, like...

44:07.520 --> 44:10.580
Oh, my God, I'm digging myself a hole here.
Change the subject, Katie.

44:10.680 --> 44:14.580
I'm gonna go and get some breakfast and I'll,
er, I'll catch up with you in a bit, OK?

44:14.680 --> 44:16.780
I've got to work out what
adventures people are on today.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.340
Got the money for those
Splash Planet tickets?

44:19.440 --> 44:21.420
Yes, of course.
How much do we owe you?

44:21.520 --> 44:22.900
400 bucks.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.740
400? I thought it was $75 a ticket.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.940
It is, but there's this
premium when I get them.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.302
- It's just a thing.
- Oh, OK. Cool.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.189
Looks like I'll have to get out
my mum's emergency stash.

44:38.640 --> 44:39.900
Oh. All right, kinky.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.660
Ha. No, no, it's not that.

44:41.760 --> 44:45.342
She gave me a bit extra for
emergencies as a precautionary thing.

44:50.960 --> 44:54.143
Well, cheers, mate.
I'll see you at the water park.

44:55.440 --> 44:58.111
- So I've sorted out the...
- Wait. I'm thinking.

45:02.120 --> 45:04.791
<i>Swimming, swimming, swimming,
swimming, swimming</i>

45:05.240 --> 45:07.104
<i>Just stay in your lanes...</i>

45:07.680 --> 45:09.860
To be fair,
Splash Planet looked amazing.

45:09.960 --> 45:14.180
And even though Jay insisted that 80%
of the water was made up of vaginal fluid,

45:14.280 --> 45:16.189
we still couldn't wait
to try out the rides,

45:16.720 --> 45:18.540
or, better still, work there.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.580
I'm looking for a job
as a dolphin trainer.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.540
Are you a qualified marine biologist?

45:22.640 --> 45:24.060
No, but I'm English.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.020
OK. We don't have any jobs.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.460
But you can swim with
them for 75 bucks.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.071
Oh, cool, like work experience?

45:31.040 --> 45:32.744
- No.
- All right, I'm in.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.060
- Did you get the job, then?
- No.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.860
- That's well racist.
- I'm gonna swim with one, though.

45:38.960 --> 45:41.108
And I'm gonna give
it the time of its life.

45:42.600 --> 45:45.620
Is it just me or did it sound like
he's gonna wank off a dolphin?

45:45.720 --> 45:47.424
That is what it sounded like.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.820
We split up and I went to find Katie.

45:50.920 --> 45:54.100
Last night she said I was sexy.
So, today, I just had to seal the deal,

45:54.200 --> 45:56.220
by laughing at anything
she said or did.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.220
Got ya.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.580
Yes. Yes, you did.
What a good joke that is.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.430
- Always funny.
- Hi.

46:03.840 --> 46:07.069
Let's get on these rides, then.
It's the best hangover cure ever!

46:09.400 --> 46:11.070
Yes.

46:11.400 --> 46:16.222
I've heard the water pressure on
some of these slides is quite... high.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.220
Oh, look out. Hypocrite alert.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.940
Ben, you came! Cool. Hi.

46:22.040 --> 46:25.260
Hi. Yeah, I wanted to see what
the tourists saw in the place.

46:25.360 --> 46:27.420
I'm not a tourist, man.
I've got a backpack, for one.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.340
In Bolivia, they say,
"If you put a shell on a donkey,

46:30.440 --> 46:32.260
does that make him a crab?"

46:32.360 --> 46:35.464
- Don't know what that means, Ben.
- You'll find out.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.468
- Right, let's ride some flumes.
- Yes!

46:45.720 --> 46:47.900
Jay and Simon had left
me to, as Jay put it,

46:48.000 --> 46:49.860
"Chase after Katie
like a little prick,"

46:49.960 --> 46:53.740
while they, for some unknown reason,
headed to the Lazy River... a child's ride.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.740
- Does Jane work on this ride, then?
- No.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.980
But, as you can see from
this map of the park,

46:58.080 --> 47:00.780
the Lazy River pretty much
covers the whole place.

47:00.880 --> 47:04.340
So, basically, we get on,
drift around till we see her. Simples!

47:04.440 --> 47:05.820
Is that map entirely accurate?

47:05.920 --> 47:08.180
There are pirates and crocodiles
having a sword fight on it.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.542
It's a map, all right?
Maps don't lie.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.060
I'm so sorry if the
kids are bothering you.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.024
Course not. No, not at all.
I love kids.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.066
He's a paedophile.

47:21.706 --> 47:25.503
Seriously, I'm trying to help you.
All right. Nudgies.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.542
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

47:32.280 --> 47:35.140
Nudgies was fast becoming
no-one's favourite game.

47:35.240 --> 47:38.140
Meanwhile, Neil was teaching animals
only slightly cleverer than him

47:38.240 --> 47:40.263
that there's more to life than fish.

47:43.680 --> 47:47.660
OK, guys, now you get some very special
one-on-one time with your dolphins.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.750
If you'd like to take
your positions...

47:54.120 --> 47:55.900
Hello, gorgeous.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.465
Come here.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.943
Good boy!

48:00.920 --> 48:02.943
This is amazing.

48:04.960 --> 48:07.180
Look, apparently I'm not
allowed to train you,

48:07.280 --> 48:09.460
because it turns out
this lot are well racist.

48:09.560 --> 48:12.584
But there's one thing I can
give you that they can't.

48:18.480 --> 48:19.980
On land, we call that a burger.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.820
McDonald's probably do the best one,
followed by Burger King.

48:22.920 --> 48:26.620
You like it, do you? Come on,
that's gotta be worth a kiss.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.180
Lovely!

48:28.280 --> 48:31.260
They say dolphins are clever,
but what they don't tell you is,

48:31.360 --> 48:33.144
they're also greedy little bastards.

48:33.520 --> 48:36.220
Meanwhile Jay and Simon were
sticking to their terrible plan.

48:36.320 --> 48:38.700
This might not be the quickest
way to search the park.

48:38.800 --> 48:42.268
It'll be fine. It's a matter of
time before we find her. Chill.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.660
Jay?

48:49.760 --> 48:51.660
- Is that him?
- Yeah, Dad, that's him.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.060
All right.

48:53.160 --> 48:55.706
Hey, mate, what are you
doing with those kids?

48:56.440 --> 48:59.300
No, wait. My friend was joking.

48:59.400 --> 49:01.180
- You're disgusting.
- I don't love kids.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.140
Please. I hate kids!

49:03.240 --> 49:05.263
They're not... sexy!

49:05.480 --> 49:07.901
Please... agh! Jay?

49:08.520 --> 49:12.260
Meanwhile, I was trying to impress
a girl I'd recently fingered to sleep.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.460
Oh, my God! This is the one.
Rapids Racer. It's amazing.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.580
You race other people down rapids.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.820
Cool. How about me
versus beaky, then?

49:19.920 --> 49:22.140
Loser has to do a naked
streak round the park.

49:22.240 --> 49:25.340
Yeah, that's hilarious!
Will, you're up for it, aren't you?

49:25.440 --> 49:27.100
I would be, but I'm...

49:27.200 --> 49:28.540
- Boring?
- No, Ben.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.980
- Scared? Ashamed of your tiny penis?
- No, Ben.

49:31.080 --> 49:32.940
Actually I get nosebleeds.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.900
- What?
- I think he said he gets nosebleeds.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.590
Come on, let's race.

49:37.880 --> 49:39.345
Will.

49:40.040 --> 49:43.180
- What happened to you?
- Oh, I was waterboarded on the Lazy River

49:43.280 --> 49:45.820
because Jay told some
parents I was a paedophile.

49:45.920 --> 49:48.620
- Pretty good. Where's Jay now?
- He's gone to find Jane.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.620
- Jane?
- That's why he's in Australia.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.820
She works here and he's
desperate to get her back.

49:52.920 --> 49:56.300
I'm not supposed to tell anyone,
but... after that, fuck him.

49:56.400 --> 49:58.264
Will, come on.

49:59.320 --> 50:01.343
What about your nosebleeds?

50:02.920 --> 50:04.943
Did you want something?

50:05.240 --> 50:08.340
Yeah, I'm looking for someone
that works here, a girl called Jane.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.900
Ok, we've had a few Janes.
What does she look like?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.068
She's got, like, red hair, quite big.

50:13.800 --> 50:16.780
Well, no, beautiful, really,
like really, really beautiful.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.780
Yes, I know Jane.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.580
Yeah, she's a stunner all right?

50:20.680 --> 50:22.460
So whereabouts is she working today?

50:22.560 --> 50:25.980
She left about a month ago, mate. She got
a dream job, with horses or something.

50:26.080 --> 50:28.780
- Did she say where?
- No, sorry. Outback somewhere?

50:28.880 --> 50:32.100
Oh, that's all right. Guess I'll head
to the outback and go find her.

50:32.200 --> 50:35.140
To the outback?
Yeah, you'll find her no problems.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.469
- Will I? Jahmazing.
- Are you some kind of moron?

50:38.760 --> 50:41.100
Of course you fucking won't.
The outback's enormous.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.223
Nah, you'll never find her.

50:48.680 --> 50:51.101
- Is your lip all right?
- Yeah.

50:52.560 --> 50:54.981
If she gets in touch, want me
to say you're looking for her?

50:55.480 --> 50:57.420
No, it's cool. I'm not even bothered.

50:57.520 --> 51:00.540
I've got some stuff to
sort out in... Vietnam,

51:00.640 --> 51:02.140
like CIA shit.

51:02.240 --> 51:05.300
Basically, I'm getting my own private
train with a machine gun on front.

51:05.400 --> 51:07.660
I'm gonna drive across
the country, standing up,

51:07.760 --> 51:10.784
firing out the machine gun
as it goes along, so...

51:18.160 --> 51:19.940
Now it's time for some chicken.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.790
Ssh! Don't tell anyone.

51:26.280 --> 51:30.430
All right, but this is the last one.
It's the bollocks. Meatball sandwich.

51:43.120 --> 51:44.790
Wake up.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.231
Come on!

52:00.680 --> 52:03.620
We'll never know for certain
exactly what killed the dolphin,

52:03.720 --> 52:05.743
but we do know that Neil did it.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.540
There was tension in the
air as we waited to race.

52:09.640 --> 52:12.425
And tension in the queue as Neil
barged past with his irritable bowels.

52:13.745 --> 52:14.900
Out the way.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.820
- Get in line, mate.
- No, I've got mates.

52:16.920 --> 52:18.943
- I'm going up there.
- All right?

52:19.840 --> 52:22.740
- How were the dolphins?
- The dolphins are fine, totally fine.

52:22.840 --> 52:24.660
- Why wouldn't they be?
- Only asking.

52:24.760 --> 52:26.669
I don't wanna talk about
the fucking dolphins!

52:27.375 --> 52:30.260
- Oh, my God!
- Soz. That's my irritating bowels.

52:30.360 --> 52:33.060
- Next two up.
- Right, good luck, boys.

52:33.160 --> 52:36.309
See you at the bottom.
And don't forget, loser streaks.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.860
Seriously, I would have thought
it'd have been gone by now.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.820
- It's a new one.
- Jesus, Neil.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.590
- I can't stop 'em.
- OK, next two.

52:49.520 --> 52:51.260
- Will, I've got an issue.
- Ready to lose?

52:51.360 --> 52:52.900
- I'm not, but you are.
- Will.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.700
- I'm not gonna lose.
- What's that, mate? No, I'm gonna win.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.100
- Will.
- I can't lose.

52:57.200 --> 52:58.420
- We'll see about that.
- Will.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.500
- I don't lose.
- You wish, jellyfish.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.460
- What?
- Will.

53:02.560 --> 53:06.020
Will, I need help. That last one,
I think maybe I followed through.

53:06.120 --> 53:07.745
Go.

53:09.320 --> 53:11.020
Look, it's my bowels,
they're disabled!

53:11.120 --> 53:12.301
Oh, no.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.460
Will!

53:14.560 --> 53:16.500
Will, poo! Poo!

53:16.600 --> 53:18.623
I'm sorry! It just slipped out!

53:20.000 --> 53:20.980
Poo!

53:21.080 --> 53:22.060
No!

53:22.160 --> 53:24.831
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no!

53:26.960 --> 53:28.471
God! Oh, no!

53:29.400 --> 53:30.380
No!

53:30.480 --> 53:33.420
Go faster, go fucking faster!

53:33.520 --> 53:36.305
Out of the water! Clear!

53:37.640 --> 53:39.504
Clear!

53:41.600 --> 53:43.623
Clear!

53:44.720 --> 53:46.902
Yeah! You won! Yeah!

53:47.800 --> 53:48.981
No!

53:55.120 --> 53:56.506
Oh, my God!

54:02.880 --> 54:04.061
Please.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.225
Oh, my God!

54:54.440 --> 54:56.460
It wasn't funny, Simon.
I was arrested.

54:56.560 --> 55:00.020
Well, I don't know if the Splash Planet
security team can strictly arrest you.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.380
- Children were crying.
- I don't think that was you.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.700
I think that was to do with
that dolphin that died.

55:04.800 --> 55:07.740
- Neil, you were swimming with them.
- I didn't swim with any dolphins.

55:07.840 --> 55:11.180
If you keep telling lies about me,
I'll bring up your mum's hairy face again.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.745
Calm down.

55:13.880 --> 55:15.664
All you all right, Jay?

55:16.200 --> 55:18.860
- Everything's ruined.
- What's up? Your tight foreskin thing?

55:18.960 --> 55:20.180
I've fucked it up again.

55:20.280 --> 55:23.180
- Lay off it for a week. It'll get better.
- She's gone, forever.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.620
- Who?
- Jane.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.220
I should never have
bought her a Wii Fit.

55:26.320 --> 55:29.230
She said she wanted to lose a bit
of weight. I was just trying to help.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.300
I loved her the way she was.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.980
You bought her a Wii Fit?

55:33.080 --> 55:36.620
So I came here to find her,
to apologise, to try and win her back.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.500
But I had no idea how
big Australia was.

55:38.600 --> 55:41.580
I knew it was an island, so I thought,
"It can't be that big.

55:41.680 --> 55:45.260
I'll probably just bump into her down
the shops." But it's fucking massive!

55:45.360 --> 55:48.589
And now she's gone forever
and my life is pointless again.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.660
Sorry... you bought her a Wii Fit?

55:52.760 --> 55:55.460
My dad was right, he should
have just whipped it out

55:55.560 --> 55:58.982
and splurged on my mum's arse
rather than waste it making me.

56:01.880 --> 56:05.029
I still love her,
but I'll never find her.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.060
Si could always ask
Lucy where she is.

56:14.160 --> 56:16.183
Shit, yeah, Lucy'll probably know.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.740
- Really?
- Actually, yeah.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.580
She'll definitely know.
She sent her a wedding invitation.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.300
Let's go. I'll Skype her now.

56:23.400 --> 56:25.340
- Shotgun.
- Don't worry, mate. We'll find her.

56:25.440 --> 56:28.860
- Thanks for this, Si.
- No problem. You would do the same for me.

56:28.960 --> 56:32.143
- We wouldn't, your bird's a fucking nightmare.
- Fair enough.

56:40.240 --> 56:43.580
So far, my travelling experience
wasn't going entirely to plan.

56:43.680 --> 56:47.501
I'd assumed that I'd get shitfaced
at some point... but not literally.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.900
Right, you lot go and pack up
our stuff. I'll Skype Lucy.

56:57.200 --> 56:58.631
Will!

56:59.280 --> 57:00.541
Will!

57:01.520 --> 57:02.746
Will!

57:03.640 --> 57:08.020
Katie, I'm so embarrassed by my friends.
It's Neil's fault. He's got this thing...

57:08.120 --> 57:11.260
It was fucking hysterical!
Closing down Splash Planet?

57:11.360 --> 57:14.180
I mean, everyone is talking about
what an absolute legend you are.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.620
- I'm a legend?
- I mean, it looked horrific.

57:16.720 --> 57:18.780
- You were covered in shit, yeah?
- Yeah.

57:18.880 --> 57:22.940
But at the same time, it was literally the
funniest thing I've seen. We all loved it!

57:23.040 --> 57:25.860
If it made you laugh, maybe it
was worth getting conjunctivitis.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.820
You're mental!

57:27.920 --> 57:30.020
So what do you wanna do later, then?

57:30.120 --> 57:31.940
Drink? Bite to eat?

57:32.040 --> 57:34.220
Sea kayaking, zip lining, bungee?

57:34.320 --> 57:37.300
- Will, come on. You've gotta pack.
- I am talking, Simon.

57:37.400 --> 57:40.020
- Sorry about that.
- Pack? What? You can't leave!

57:40.120 --> 57:43.060
The gang'll be gutted. No,
you're not actually leaving, are you?

57:43.160 --> 57:45.380
- Yes.
- Well, nothing's finalised.

57:45.480 --> 57:47.380
But it's the songline
ceremony tonight.

57:47.480 --> 57:50.060
Look, it's perfect for you, Will.
It's incredibly spiritual.

57:50.160 --> 57:52.620
We're going to the outback.
Will should be packing up now.

57:52.720 --> 57:55.180
OK, well, if you're busy,
I'll leave you to it.

57:55.280 --> 57:58.623
No, Katie, I'm not busy. I apologise
for my friend. He's very rude.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.900
Now, tell me about sea kayaking.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.740
It's amazing. They've got these
kayaks, right, that go in the sea.

58:04.840 --> 58:07.466
- No way!
- It's absolutely unbelievable.

58:10.520 --> 58:13.740
Simon, this was not an
agreed time for Skype.

58:13.840 --> 58:16.060
Lucy, listen, do you know
where Jane is staying?

58:16.160 --> 58:18.780
Of course I do. Simon, we need
to talk about photographers.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.980
You'll have to take out
another student loan.

58:21.080 --> 58:22.940
Christ. Really?

58:23.040 --> 58:25.746
Right, fine, whatever.
Can you just get me her address?

58:26.080 --> 58:29.300
- And I've asked Pete to be your best man.
- Aren't I meant to decide that?

58:29.400 --> 58:32.700
All your friends are
massive dicks, except Pete.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.300
It's Pete or no-one.

58:34.400 --> 58:36.820
Great, fine. It's Pete.
Now, I need that address.

58:36.920 --> 58:40.140
- Pete's been amazing.
- Yeah, Pete's amazing. Please, Lucy.

58:40.240 --> 58:42.580
Thanks, mate. I am amazing. G'day.

58:42.680 --> 58:44.540
- Pete.
- Surprise.

58:44.640 --> 58:47.380
How are things down under?
And I don't mean your horrible balls.

58:47.480 --> 58:51.141
- You've got horrible balls.
- You actually have, though.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.500
- Banter.
- So, go on. How is it, then?

58:53.600 --> 58:55.820
Not been eaten by a
shark yet, worse luck?

58:55.920 --> 58:58.100
Thank you. Yeah,
some best man you are!

58:58.200 --> 59:01.660
I'm the best of the best, mate. You know it.
I should be called the brilliant man.

59:01.760 --> 59:04.340
Yeah! Listen, mate,
we're in a bit of a rush.

59:04.440 --> 59:05.500
OK.

59:05.600 --> 59:08.500
So she's staying at Bewley
Stud Farm near Birdsville.

59:08.600 --> 59:12.140
I don't have the exact address because
they pick up the post from the town hotel.

59:12.240 --> 59:15.460
- So what's the house number?
- I told you, I don't have it.

59:15.560 --> 59:17.700
It's a massive farm, you div.
You'll find it.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.980
- Yeah, you div.
- Huh. Of course.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.103
Over and out, Captain Kirk.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.300
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

59:26.400 --> 59:28.820
She's at a stud farm near Birdsville.

59:28.920 --> 59:32.300
That's me fucked. If she's at a
stud farm, then she'll have her pick.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.389
I've got no chance. I've lost her!

59:34.600 --> 59:37.306
A stud farm's where
they breed horses.

59:38.400 --> 59:39.940
Yes, I know.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.347
I'm just saying,
she really likes horses.

59:46.600 --> 59:48.820
You won't need a life vest
in the car, Will. It's dry.

59:48.920 --> 59:51.180
- Get that off. We're leaving.
- I'm staying here.

59:51.280 --> 59:54.220
- Don't be a dick. Just get in the car.
- No. I'm staying for a bit.

59:54.320 --> 59:57.100
Then I'll do some real travelling
with people who do it properly.

59:57.200 --> 59:59.180
Those tools in there?
They think you're a twat.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.260
And I've met someone
I like who likes me.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.860
Will, be careful. Jay told me muff before
mates is actually a crime in Australia.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.940
You think you're my mates?
You don't do any of the things I like,

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.060
you don't talk about things I
like and you shit on my face.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.700
- Why would I come with you?
- I only shit on your face once.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.900
I'm not sure how much clearer
I can make it. I'm not coming.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.220
Fine. Fuck you.
We'll go to Birdsville without you.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.900
You're being stupid. You got dumped,
just like I got dumped,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.020
just like Simon will probably get dumped...
Sorry, I mean divorced.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.460
Get over it and be realistic.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.823
Chasing a girl round Australia isn't
romantic, it's extreme stalking.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.903
That's exactly what
you're doing to Katie.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.060
- Grow up, Simon.
- You grow up.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.820
I am grown up. You should grow up.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.700
- Really? Grow up.
- I am. You're not. So grow up.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.420
That's grown up. Grow up!

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.140
- Yeah, you should.
- We'll see who's grown up, won't we?

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.780
- Grow up.
- Grow up!

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.980
- Grow up!
- Grow... up!

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.420
Grow up.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.780
I feel a bit sad. Can I drive?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.740
- Yeah, sure.
- And can I be best man?

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.146
No, it's fucking Pete.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.743
Here's your fucking bag!

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.740
Grow up!

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.625
Off they went, the idiots.
Good riddance to them.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.790
I was gonna have an authentic
experience sea kayaking.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.780
And at least if I drowned,
and it looked like I might drown,

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.100
people could say,
"He died doing what he did best:

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.541
making a twat of himself
in front of a girl."

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.030
Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.830
Aa-aargh!

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.985
Aaagh!

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.067
Whoaagh! Waagh!

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.150
A-wob a-bob bob?

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.060
- What?
- I said, what time is it now?

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.700
No, you fucking didn't.
You said, "A-wob a-bob bob."

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.740
- Are you sure you're OK to drive?
- Yeah, fine.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.700
Although I think I might cry again.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.028
- Is it far now?
- No, it's only about...

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.700
400 miles. You can
make that, can't you, Neil?

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.823
Course. Got a system.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.629
Maybe we should stop for a bit.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.740
Now we have cleansed the area
with sound, we can begin.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.500
We are sitting on songlines,

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.060
the ancient lines of power
that cross Australia.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.980
Can you feel the connection?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.820
- Yeah.
- It's amazing.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.780
We carry a great responsibility.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.740
What we say here before the fire,

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.860
we transmit out, on the songlines,
to the rest of the planet.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.540
Let's help heal the world by throwing
all the world's negativities onto the fire.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.940
Each think of a
negativity and burn it.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.426
What's your negativity?

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.423
- Narrow-mindedness.
- Good.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.100
Stephen?

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.380
Oh, God, where to start?

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.026
I'm just a seeker, a searcher, but...

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.020
present in this moment,

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.740
away from the past, away from a
military father who I love so much

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.660
but Daddy wasn't around,
and away from a distant mother.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.431
But I'm here now,
in the now, not there.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.105
Just wondering how to tell
Mummy what hugs mean.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.507
She asked what negativity
you want to throw on the fire.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.503
Oh, right. Yeah, cool.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.540
- Conformity.
- Excellent.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.868
- Really good.
- What's your negativity, brother?

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.422
Come on.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.460
- ...negativity.
- Yes. Which one?

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.380
Just negativity.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.062
Remember, we can help
heal the whole world.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.740
- Pass.
- Pass?

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.988
Maybe you should just
tell me the right answer.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.180
There's no right answer.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.984
Clearly there is, though.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.380
Raw Pot Noodle, anyone?

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.140
Not bad, but a bit crunchy.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.700
I reckon I'll probably propose
to Jane when I see her.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.020
What about the Thai bird you
told me you were seeing?

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.380
The black belt at firing Ping-Pong
balls out of her fanny.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.940
Oh, her? Yeah, no, she had
to go back to Vietnam.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.820
- Thailand.
- Thailand.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.740
Yeah, no, Jane's the one.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.900
I'll be married,
and you'll be married, Si.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.580
- Yeah.
- So we can go on double dates and stuff.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.500
Yeah. Lucy's not that bad, really.
Maybe being married to her will be all right.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.460
- It will be.
- Gotta be easier than breaking up with her.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.947
She's microwaved my PlayStation.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.947
Della?

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.506
- Racism.
- Oh, I hate that.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.260
Ben?

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.220
- Negative thoughts.
- Good.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.980
How is that different
to "negativity"?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.751
Will, please,
just respect the songlines.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.701
- Kristian.
- Racial hatred.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.980
Yeah, already had that one, Kris.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.500
- What?
- We've had that.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.220
Think of another one.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.740
So you think racial
hatred is a good thing?

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.860
You know I'm not saying that, Ben.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.620
She said, "Racism." He said,
"Racial hatred." Pick another.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.740
Will, there's no right
or wrong answers.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.620
Yes, there is. You know there is.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.780
Let it all flow out.
We'll support you.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.980
- There's no judgment here.
- So you keep saying.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.300
In that case, I'd like to throw the
poor and disadvantaged onto the fire,

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.500
and the handicapped,
the homeless, and babies.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.820
Yes, spazzy little African babies
riddled with malaria and AIDS.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.900
There they go, onto the fire.
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.620
- How's that?
- That is wrong.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.345
Yep, thought it might be.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.271
Excuse me.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.980
I throw anger onto the fire.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.580
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.147
- Stephen?
- Infidelity.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.067
Oh, will you just fucking let it go?

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.380
Will, are you OK?

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.860
Yeah.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.780
- Sorry. I didn't mean to ruin it.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.980
No, we still had an
amazing connection.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.980
Oh, good. That's good.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:34.020
Listen, whatever your energy is
when you interact over fire stones,

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.580
that's your song,
and your song is humour.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.740
Oh.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.940
- Thank you.
- And also anger.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.220
You have a large,
quite deep anger song in you.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.820
Frustration, maybe.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.389
And sometimes it's hard to hear the humour
song with the anger song singing so very loud.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.543
You do like me, don't you, Katie?

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.624
Of course I do.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.580
Sorry, Ben, this is a private party.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.703
Oh, OK.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.864
See you later.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.820
Are you OK?

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.943
- That was horrible.
- What was?

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.900
Him just kissing you like that.
Do you want me to call somebody?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.620
- He shouldn't get away with that.
- Oh, I know.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.504
He can be such a tease.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.660
- Tease?
- He knows that drives me crazy.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.589
Crazy angry, right?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.420
And tingly.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.100
Bad tingly, like really
severe pins and needles?

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.100
Oh, God, no. Nice.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.348
It's scary. I don't
know how he does it.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.143
What is happening here?

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.100
We've been having this
on/off thing for ages,

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.460
and he drives me mental when
we fight, but, in the end,

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.100
the animal urge,
it's just too much to ignore.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.100
- You said he was a dick.
- Will, I wish you'd get to know him.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.302
He is such a spiritual guy.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.870
So you're with him,
even though you kissed me?

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.500
Will, I like you. I kissed you.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.180
But I kiss a lot of people,
especially when I'm drunk.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.500
What Ben and I have,
it's a deep lust for each other.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.900
- It's spiritual.
- Right, that's the last time.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.020
Even the dictionary
definition of spiritual,

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.300
which I looked up,
suggests it's about the soul,

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:21.460
another vague and probably
non-existent concept.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.779
I don't think you get it.
But that's cool.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.380
No, no, I get it all right,
you patronising cow.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:29.340
It's you twats that don't get it.
That's right, I called you twats.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.580
Chill, Will.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.540
Playing the guitar badly,
wearing beads, talking about one love,

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.036
pretending you're friends with Central
American villagers, who, by the way,

01:08:37.136 --> 01:08:40.620
despise you, before heading to your
parents' five-bedroom house in Surrey,

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.140
doesn't make you a spiritual person,
it makes you a bellend.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.700
I think you're right
about his song, Katie.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.020
Fuck off, Ben! You don't believe
in songlines any more than I do.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.020
It's just a way to seem
interesting to girls

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.500
because deep down,
you're boring and pretentious,

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.220
like your stupid fucking dreadlocks,

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.939
which, by the way, always look
embarrassing on white people.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.380
They're not countercultural.
They scream, "I've got a trust fund."

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:05.301
So get a normal haircut,
you unbearable prick. Goodbye.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.220
I may have won the battle,
but I'd lost the war.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:13.660
By now, my real friends were
hundreds of miles away,

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.460
but my fake friends were
a little too close to home.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.220
- I don't lose.
- Oh, Ben.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.899
I don't lose. I don't lose.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.665
- I... don't... lose!
- Oh, Ben!

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:31.345
<i>Uh-oh-oh-oh, and they come unstuck</i>

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:35.540
<i>Lady, running down to the riptide</i>

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.504
<i>Taken away to the dark side...</i>

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.580
One ticket to Birdsville.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.942
So that'll be $350.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.020
- Have you flown this route before?
- No.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.859
OK. You'll want these, then.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.064
There's some sick bags,
because you are gonna be sick.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.620
Oh, fuck!

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.461
Oh, my Go-o-o-d!

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.260
- Get out, you pommy mongrels.
- See you later. They were nice.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.060
Apart from when they
tried to fight us.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.620
It's the next property,
just down the Birdsville Track.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.504
Yeah, not far now, mate.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.509
- Wait! Wait!
- What the fuck is that?

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.543
Guys! Wait!

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.864
I think it's a prick.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.780
I had to get here.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.950
I'm just so lost at the
moment with uni and...

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.469
I know I've made some bad decisions but
I'm finding it hard to know who I am.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.860
- Don't worry about that. Leave that.
- We'd better get going.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.500
Listen, please.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.260
I don't have many friends
and I thought those people...

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.507
Nudgies.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.630
Get in.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.023
Ooh, you're hard.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.983
<i>Mandatory</i>

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.340
<i>We can get in the car,
we can give it a spin</i>

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.940
<i>Make a break from the crowd,
see how close we can get</i>

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.620
Next farm! Next farm! Next farm!

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.580
Next farm! Next farm!

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.430
Next farm! Next farm...

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.300
Did they say exactly how
far the next farm is?

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.340
Shit. We're on the white
bit of the petrol meter.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.670
Don't worry about that, that's a con,
by car makers and oil people,

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.740
to get you to buy more. I went to
Portugal and back on the white bit.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.180
- I don't know. It looks quite low.
- Please, let's just keep going.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.589
There's bound to be a petrol
station round here somewhere.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.900
Oh, shit.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.990
Don't worry. I'll just coast
it for a couple of miles.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.227
- It's very hot in here.
- Yeah, sorry about that. I had the heating on.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.940
What now? Wait for someone
to pass by to help?

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.460
Bollocks. Just phone the AA
and they'll come pick us up.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.583
How's the reception on your phone?

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.220
- Oh, fuck!
- Exactly.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.468
We should get out of the car,
though. It's an oven.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.740
It's not that much cooler
out of the car, to be fair.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.820
All right, we're in a
bit of a spot here.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.500
We've got to keep calm. Do not panic.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.100
How much water have we got?

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.540
None.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.380
OK. Bad start.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.820
We'll be fine. There'll probably be a
wise old Aboriginal along any minute.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:00.380
Think. In the two hours since we left
Birdsville, how many cars have we seen?

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.780
Ooh. None.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.180
None is correct. Now,
how many wise old Aboriginals?

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.420
- None.
- None.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.540
Fucking none. We aren't
in England any more.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.460
We're somewhere genuinely dangerous.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.500
Don't shit your pants.
I know Australia.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.060
- Someone will be along in a minute.
- But what if they aren't?

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.420
- They will be.
- Anyone want a drink?

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.020
- Have you got water?
- No, just wondered.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.780
- I'm really thirsty.
- We need a survival plan.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.340
No, I doubt it.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.340
In the desert without water,
we'll die in a day.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.380
- I think we're going to be fine.
- How, Simon?

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.260
Tell me how we're gonna be fine.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.340
- People will be looking for us.
- Who?

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.140
Who even knows we're missing,
or cares? Your dad?

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.420
Jay's uncle?

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.861
Your mum, if she wasn't
getting fucked by a stranger.

01:13:39.456 --> 01:13:41.460
It's nasty, but it's probably true.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.420
- We could drink our piss.
- What?

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.380
It's all right. I do it occasionally.
I ate a bit of my spunk once too.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.340
You're grim, mate.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.349
I need a piss and it seems
a shame to waste it.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.145
Up to you.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.500
Neil, do you have to do that here?

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.780
If you can't see it coming
out the end, it's not rude.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.380
Wait a minute.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.471
There's probably water in the windscreen
washer pot. We could share that out.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.302
Perfect. This should keep us going.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.510
Uncle Jay sorts it again.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.340
- It was soap.
- Obviously.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.980
Seriously, we do need a plan.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.460
I saw that film where the bloke
got stuck in the desert but lived.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.700
- What did he do?
- Cut his arm off with a penknife.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.500
Right. Any other ideas?

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.900
I watched every episode of
Bear Grylls' Man Vs. Wild.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.780
OK. Now we're getting somewhere.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.420
What would Bear suggest we
do in this situation, Neil?

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.220
OK, when we get a salmon, just bite
into the middle, even though it's raw.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.264
There isn't any water. Where do we
get a salmon, you fucking idiot?

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.581
Shop.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.620
Neil's got a point. Split up
and search for water sources.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.743
- And a salmon.
- Yes.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.660
Thanks very much, Dad. Thanks for
not teaching me how to find water,

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.340
the only thing I would need to
know in my entire fucking life.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.747
"Go and do a sociology degree.
That'll be fucking helpful."

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.900
<i>Well, so it goes, yeah, so it goes</i>

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.023
Si, quick! Look!

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.310
<i>That sweet heirloom,
them abbey stones</i>

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.426
<i>Yeah, let's take a chance
oh, and roll the bones</i>

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.220
OK, learn from your mistakes.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.266
Wandering around failing to find water
just uses up calories. We've learnt that.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.380
I can't believe we didn't
bring any sun cream.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.540
Not even, like, factor eight.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.580
Even some shitty factor eight
would make the situation better.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.021
God, I'd love some
factor eight right now.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.460
Oh, my gosh. A lake!

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.820
A fucking lake! We're saved.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.988
But I can't believe we
never spotted that.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.340
- It's a mirage, Neil.
- Is that Australian for lake?

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.740
It means cos you're hot,
you're seeing things.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.340
- What if it is a lake?
- You're seeing things. It's an illusion.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.580
If I was seeing things,
I'd be seeing cool things,

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.660
like Optimus Prime
banging Katy Perry,

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.500
or Jay the size of a house but all
his fingers are Cadbury's Flakes.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.020
- I want water more than anything.
- I'll get us water, Si. Don't worry.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.871
This is it. We're saved.
Thank you, Bear Grylls!

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.586
No-o-o-o!

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.103
- I told him so.
- I know you did.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.627
- Can we start panicking now?
- Yeah.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.662
No-o-o-o!

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.260
I bet they use a shit picture.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.700
What?

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.300
When they report us being dead,

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.300
I bet they use a picture
where my hair looks shit.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.180
They'll have plenty to choose from.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.540
And I'll be described
as engaged, for fuck's sake.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.180
I bet Lucy'll love that.
She'll milk the attention, the cow.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.460
- I don't think you'll be that bothered.
- I will.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.060
I don't think you will be.
Cos, crucially, you'll be dead.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.025
Stone fucking dead,
just like we all will.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.981
Oh, God. I don't wanna die.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.985
For fuck's sake,
I'm too dehydrated to cry.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.380
I wish my mum was here.

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.867
- Does she deliver water?
- She does when I'm nearby.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.830
From her fanny.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.380
I'm so fucking thirsty.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.620
Do you wanna try the spunk thing?
It's a bit like a salty smoothie.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.300
I can't think of anything I wanna
do less right now than wank.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.470
Jesus, things are even more
serious than I thought.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.020
Neil, if you can piss
again now, I'll drink it.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.029
You should really only
drink your own, Si.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.464
I'm so dehydrated, I can't piss.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.068
Neil, please, help.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.664
I'm dying.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.543
Course, mate.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.940
Sorry, Si. I've got no more piss.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.260
That's all right, mate.
Thanks for trying.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:10.066
I was trying, Si, I really was.
It's just... Oh.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.430
And there was that bit.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.900
I'm hot, then cold, then hot.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.260
- Then really cold.
- And you stink of piss.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.900
I really didn't think
dying would be like this.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.341
It's knackering to get
wound up about it.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.305
Just let it happen, I reckon.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.547
No. Please fight it, Jay.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.783
There's something I need to say.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.390
What?

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.220
- Sorry.
- Oh, mate.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.787
I am. I'm sorry.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.105
Just...

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.306
Sorry.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.625
It don't matter.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.020
There's something I always
meant to ask you guys, too.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.904
What is it, mate?

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.303
How long after a poo
can you have sex?

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.180
Please don't make
this my last thought.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.140
I never found out, and...

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.263
now I'll never know.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.780
I can't see very well.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.903
I think it's just the brightness.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.823
Close your eyes.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.543
- But you said...
- I know.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.231
Here.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.301
Neil.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.789
- For bants.
- Yeah, for bants.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.460
That's better.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.185
Die, then?

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.143
Sorry, Dad.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.063
Sorry, Jane.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.989
It'll be like sleep, won't it, Si?
I've always liked sleep.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.950
Yeah, it'll be OK, Neil.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.783
All right, then.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.261
Cheers.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.063
Is this proper travelling?

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.621
Yeah.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.911
Yeah, it is.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.743
- Shall we?
- Yeah, I suppose.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.305
Jesus Christ.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.940
- Are you a mirage?
- I don't know.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.142
Would a mirage call
you a stupid cunt?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.460
We're saved! We're saved!

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.662
We're saved! We're saved!
We're saved!

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.981
Fuck me, you poms love a drama!
You've only been out here two hours.

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.265
We're alive!

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.380
Jane! Jane!

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.820
- Jane.
- Jay, oh, my God. Look at you!

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.751
I love you. Will you marry me?

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.663
I'm sorry about the Wii Fit.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.070
No, Jay.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.780
- Is your lip all right?
- Yeah.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:26.820
Jay, did you really come all this
way out here just to find me?

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.306
Yeah.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.391
But...

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.780
not because I miss you,
but because I've got an STD,

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.340
and the doctor said I have to
tell all my former lovers,

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.269
and you're the last, number 6,004.

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.980
So, that's that dealt with. Good.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.740
6,004?

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.829
Don't forget, a lot
of them was orgies.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.422
Everything's been
rubbish since you left.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.900
I work in a toilet
and I live in a tent.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.829
Oh, come here.

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.268
So, do you wanna get back together?

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.540
No. No, that's definitely
not happening.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.460
- Hashtag dumped again.
- Come on, let's get you home.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.980
Last time I saw something that soppy,
I was pulling my cock out of it.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.100
- Let's head back to the farm.
- I'm not sure we're in a state to travel.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.780
We need serious medical attention.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.460
What you need is some fucking
after sun and a beer.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.700
Now, take your clothes
off and get in the ute.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.660
Shit. Mum was right.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.908
It's the best thing
for the sunstroke.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.180
You need the heat to
leave your body quickly.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.269
Right, fine. Of course.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.387
Plus, it makes you easier to rape.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.460
We couldn't wait to
leave the outback,

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.020
although some things would
stay with us forever...

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.348
mainly the sight of
Neil's meaty penis.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.951
Jane's boss rehydrated us, fixed the car
and then we headed back to civilisation...

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.460
if you can call Uncle
Bryan's house civilised.

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.780
Neil pissed all over my head,

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.940
but I didn't manage to drink any,
then we gave up.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.900
But the stud farm sent
people to look for us,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.980
and we were on the news...
they called us pommy morons.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.860
Everyone has flown over,
they were worried.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.940
But everything's changed, Luce.
I am so lucky to be alive.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.260
And this world is just the
most beautiful thing.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.820
You are so great and I
can't wait to get married.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.385
I love you, Lucy.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.703
I've been sleeping with Pete.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.460
Sorry?

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.940
Me and your best man Pete
have been having sex.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.900
Good sex.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.220
Is this role playing again,
like when I said I'd bummed Will?

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.380
You're such a dopey prick.

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.580
I still can't believe you
come out of me nut sacks.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.180
Your nut sacks? I can't believe
we're the same species.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.900
Look at him, weedy and retarded.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.620
He's like one of them X-Men freaks,
Doctor Lawn Fucker or something.

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.664
Oh, my God, my petal, my darling!

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.985
- I missed you so much.
- I was lost in the desert too.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.060
I don't really want to be friends,
but Pete said it'd be better if we were.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.580
Wait a minute.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.460
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yes.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.020
So I'm single and now Pete
has to go out with you?

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.540
Yes, Simon!

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.505
Ye-e-e-s!

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.660
Fucking brilliant!

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.620
- Oh, hello, Mrs McKenzie.
- Hello, Simon.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.500
Your parents asked me
to check if you're OK.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.420
Me? Fucking brilliant.
Absolutely fucking brilliant.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.540
Sorry, sir. Sorry.
I didn't mean to swear.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.900
Mr Gilbert? What are you doing here?
You have no jurisdiction.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.700
Oh, Phil's just... helping me
out with a couple of things.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.420
I don't follow. "Phil"?

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.740
Do I need to spell it
out for you, McKenzie?

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.900
OK.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.020
Well, when a man loves
a lady very much,

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.660
blood rushes to the genital area,
enlarging significantly the penis.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.540
- Or, in this case, my penis.
- I mean, we wanted to tell you in person,

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.380
then you getting lost was the perfect
excuse to come and see you.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.580
Then we thought,
"Let's make it into a holiday."

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.180
Have you got any recommendations?
We've booked a Barrier Reef tour.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.906
Yes. I'm very much looking
forward to going diving.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.500
OK, so here's some bad news.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.820
It turns out we did die in the desert,
because I appear to be in hell.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:04.180
Jesus Christ, mate,
don't get me wrong,

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.900
I'm glad you stopped
fucking me garden,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.467
but what was you thinking going
all that way for a fat chick?

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.700
- What did you just say?
- About the spunk hole?

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:14.060
- No, after that.
- About you chasing the fat chick?

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.260
You're lucky Fatty Boom Boom didn't
eat you out there in the desert.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.622
Them fat chicks get
so fucking hungry...

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.820
Yeah, no, yeah, good.
I mean, good for trying.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.860
Weak as fuck, obviously,
more like a slap.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.180
You taught him how to
punch like a girl, I presume?

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.580
- Watch it, Bryan.
- Least your boy's got some spunk.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.620
But it's mainly round his
mouth and arsehole.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:36.620
- I said watch it.
- Or what? You'll slap me too?

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.700
- You...
- Here we go.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.107
Get in there! Get in there,
you ugly fuck!

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.380
I'll give it to you. Then I'll
fucking give it to you again.

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.900
Shall we go? It's getting a
bit like my cousin's wedding.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.300
- Yeah.
- In your fucking dreams.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.060
I was thinking about not going
back to England for a bit.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.820
Do some more travelling.
Vietnam's nice. Anyone fancy it?

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.700
I'm in. I've still got some shit
to sort out for the CIA there.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.020
- Neil?
- I'd like to go travelling.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.740
Go far enough,
we might find your mum.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.300
- Fuck off.
- Sorry, Neil.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.420
My Ping-Pong fanny girl's got a mate,
I could set you two up.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.820
- Nice one.
- Shake on it?

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.500
- Cheers, mate.
- He's a ladyboy.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.620
- Oh, fuck!
- Too late. You shook on it. Bad luck.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.500
- Bants?
- No, you've gotta fuck a man with tits.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.340
- Or a girl with a penis.
- Will, help me out.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.660
Sorry, Neil. You shook on it.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.340
I suppose I'd better just
stick to the top half.

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.303
<i>Live, baby, live</i>

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.023
<i>Now that the day is over</i>

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.191
<i>I got a new sensation</i>

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.227
<i>In perfect moments</i>

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.829
<i>But so impossible to refuse</i>

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.303
<i>Sleep, baby, sleep</i>

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.829
<i>Now that the night is over</i>

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.670
<i>And the sun comes like a god</i>

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.703
<i>Into our room</i>

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.586
<i>All perfect light and promises</i>

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.223
Kombucha!

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.700
<i>Got a hold on you</i>

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.029
<i>A new sensation, a new sensation</i>

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.260
<i>It's gonna take you over</i>

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.860
<i>A new sensation, a new sensation</i>

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.983
<i>Dream, baby, dream</i>

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.063
<i>Of all that's come and going</i>

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:37.464
<i>And you will find out in the end</i>

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.623
<i>There really is</i>

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.863
<i>There really is no difference</i>

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.943
<i>Cry, baby, cry</i>

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.550
<i>When you got to get it out...</i>

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.265
What the fuck?

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.260
All right? OK. Ease off.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.349
I guess that's gonna be a problem?

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.500
- Oh, fuck off! Fuck off!
- Simon.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.660
- We love it.
- Fuck off.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.146
What's up with him?

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.749
<i>Are you ready for a new sensation?</i>

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.229
<i>Right now</i>

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.423
<i>It's gonna take you over</i>

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.780
Dad, this is Nikki.
Nikki, this is Dad.

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.186
Hi.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.743
<i>A new sensation</i>

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.665
<i>A new sensation</i>

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.860
<i>A new sensation</i>

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.585
<i>Right now</i>

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.860
<i>It's got a hold on you</i>

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.585
<i>A new sensation</i>

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.704
<i>A new sensation</i>

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.860
<i>A new sensation</i>

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.188
<i>Yeah</i>

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.143
<i>A new sensation</i>
