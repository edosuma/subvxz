WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:10.609
- I had a great time on our date tonight.
- Yeah.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.976
When do you think Red's gonna
give you back the keys to the Cruiser?

00:14.047 --> 00:15.981
You know,
so we could actually...

00:16.049 --> 00:17.983
leave the property?

00:19.285 --> 00:21.753
I don't know. Maybe never.

00:21.821 --> 00:24.756
In fact, you're my only contact
with the outside world now, Donna.

00:24.824 --> 00:28.988
Do... people still laugh out there?
I miss the laughter.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.857
Well, Eric,
it's your own stupid fault.

00:32.932 --> 00:38.131
I mean, before you opened your big mouth,
Red actually believed that smell was incense.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.434
Yeah, I know. It's just...

00:40.507 --> 00:44.068
He was gonna kick Hyde out,
and I wanted to help, and...

00:44.144 --> 00:47.511
Oh, helping never helps.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.014
Eric, let's not waste time
talkin' about this.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.017
How long to the curfew?

00:52.085 --> 00:54.519
Uh, about one minute.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.782
Now, Donna,
I'm not bragging, but...

00:56.856 --> 01:00.053
if you're properly motivated, I can
actually do it in that amount of time.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.921
You don't have to tell me.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.022
Okay, so...

01:06.099 --> 01:10.433
Buckle up, Donna, 'cause the next...
12 seconds are all about you, babe.

01:10.503 --> 01:12.437
<i>Five, four...</i>

01:12.505 --> 01:14.496
- three, two, one.
- No, wait. But I... Damn.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.939
Curfew, hophead.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.581 --> 01:56.845
Geez, I wish I had a quarter...

01:56.916 --> 02:00.147
for every time I caught you
makin' out with the neighbor girl.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.716
I wish I had a quarter for
every time you embarrassed me.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.660
I wish you did too, 'cause
then you'd be a millionaire...

02:09.729 --> 02:12.163
and you could find
someplace else to live.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.763
What? And... leave all this?

02:19.439 --> 02:23.102
Okay, fellas. Who wants brownies
and a nice glass of milk?

02:23.176 --> 02:25.269
Oh, geez.

02:26.679 --> 02:30.410
Daddy, I think it's great
you gave Eric and Hyde a curfew.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.417
These boys, they need structure.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.453
Well, I'll see ya.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.648
Where do you think you're going?

02:36.723 --> 02:39.317
To... night church?

02:42.795 --> 02:44.729
Sorry, honey.
Curfew's for everyone.

02:45.865 --> 02:48.527
But, Daddy, it's me!

02:50.136 --> 02:52.661
Look, what they did is bad...

02:52.739 --> 02:56.732
but you sneakin' around with Kelso,
that's just... unpleasant.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.711
But, Daddy,
I'm not seeing Kelso.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.044
- Untrue!
- A damnable lie!

03:06.052 --> 03:07.986
A curfew?

03:08.054 --> 03:11.217
I'm stuck in this house
with you people all night? This sucks!

03:11.291 --> 03:14.158
Well, we're just
<i>thrilled</i> about it.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.957
All right. There's an upside to all this.
I took her down with me.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.964
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.103
Well, isn't this a happy house?

03:26.172 --> 03:28.163
Yeah.

03:32.645 --> 03:35.478
This is <i>not</i> a happy house.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.778
Well, you just said
this was a happy house.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.681
Well, that's not what I meant.
It was sarcasm.

03:41.754 --> 03:45.281
Who the hell knows what you mean,
when you won't say what you mean?

03:49.028 --> 03:51.121
I don't like how you're
treating the children.

03:51.197 --> 03:53.859
Look, Kitty.

03:53.933 --> 03:57.562
I'm not gonna let our kids
go down the wrong path.

03:57.637 --> 04:01.596
- But if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.
- Okay.

04:01.674 --> 04:06.043
Maybe you could be a little less strict
and a little more loving.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.053
Okay, Kitty.
Enough with the sarcasm.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.957
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me. Stop looking at me.

04:29.636 --> 04:33.629
Please look at me. Hey! Psst.

04:33.706 --> 04:37.472
I love you, Steven.
I have secret love powers.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.477
Look at me!

04:41.014 --> 04:43.812
Hmm. I have 29 teeth.

04:43.883 --> 04:48.149
No, that can't be right.
One, two, three...

04:49.989 --> 04:53.516
Jackie's in love with Hyde,
and I have nothing.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.584
Oh, look. I found an M&M.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.297
Oh, no.

05:02.535 --> 05:05.163
My life sucks.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.708
Okay, I really hope
no one smelled that.

05:11.744 --> 05:15.612
All right!
I'm the best-looking person in this room.

05:15.682 --> 05:19.778
No. In this whole town.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.548
No! No, in this whole state.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.649
No.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.496
Dumb-asses.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.897
So, how's it going?

05:34.967 --> 05:36.901
Real good.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.473
The foreign kid just
ate somethin' off the floor.

05:46.212 --> 05:50.239
Okay, well, um...
Your father's gonna drive me to work.

05:50.316 --> 05:53.251
That's right. And if you do
anything wrong, I'll know...

05:53.319 --> 05:56.447
because one of you is a snitch.

05:56.522 --> 06:00.515
<i>You just think about that</i>
<i>while I'm gone.</i>

06:00.593 --> 06:02.720
Well, they're not gonna do
anything wrong...

06:02.795 --> 06:07.095
because I brought a box of activities
to occupy their time.

06:07.166 --> 06:11.364
So, um... Be good and have fun.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.564
Do crafts, not drugs!

06:16.676 --> 06:18.610
Ooh, a model airplane and glue.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.751
Where's Steven and Eric?

06:34.827 --> 06:38.490
Um... Your hair is very pretty.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.998
Oh, they can't leave the house.
They're grounded.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.367
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're at The Hub.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.269
Oh, no. I am the snitch.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.244
Oh, Red is gonna be furious.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.872
Mrs. Forman, may I tell you
a little story about oppression?

06:57.650 --> 06:59.584
Okay.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.017
Once I had an ant farm.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.218
And they would not
build their tunnels.

07:08.861 --> 07:12.627
I was furious, so I became
very strict and stern with my ants.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.930
First they feared me,
and everything was fine...

07:17.003 --> 07:20.461
but eventually the ants
broke out and attacked me.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.474
So I had to kill them.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.180
So, um, you think we're being
too hard on the kids?

07:33.352 --> 07:35.286
Well, I don't know about that.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.755
I just wanted to let you know that
I'm really sad because my ants are dead.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.587
Okay. Well, Fez, thanks.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.222
You're a good boy.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.626
All the ladies want a piece of Fez.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.942
What are you doing?

07:58.010 --> 08:00.604
Oh, just a little
security measure...

08:00.680 --> 08:03.274
in case anybody tries to escape.

08:03.349 --> 08:08.582
Red, no. Those are my Christmas bells.
Those are happy bells.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.721
Well, then they're
doing their job...

08:12.792 --> 08:14.726
because I'm happy.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.830
Let's have some cake.

08:17.897 --> 08:23.631
Okay. And let's watch some TV,
because that makes us all happy.

08:25.004 --> 08:29.407
Okay, here we go.
<i>The Brady Bunch Variety Hour</i> is on.

08:29.475 --> 08:32.443
Oh, who the hell gave those
people an entire hour?

08:34.580 --> 08:37.207
Well, I think this program
is fun for the whole family.

08:37.283 --> 08:42.619
They've got... They've got Charo and...
and the rock band KISS.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.119
Okay, see?
Now, this is nice.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.393
A nice family who gets along
<i>and</i> sings <i>and</i> dances.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.868
Yeah, I love the Bradys.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.734
Oh, remember that episode
where Mr. Brady went completely insane...

08:59.805 --> 09:02.740
and put bells on all the doors?

09:13.653 --> 09:17.714
Hey, did you see the one
where Greg was a real wiseass...

09:19.058 --> 09:22.391
and Mr. Brady took him outside
and cleaned his clock?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.961
Did you ever see the one
where I hated living here?

09:29.468 --> 09:31.698
That one's my favorite.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.339
Well, I hope you're happy,
because now you've upset your sister.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.774
Oh... You know what?
Forget it, Dad.

09:39.845 --> 09:42.075
Enjoy yourself.
Get your shots in now.

09:42.148 --> 09:45.140
Because when I'm gone,
oh, I'm gonna be long gone.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.882
I got no place to go, so...

09:55.595 --> 09:57.529
I'm gonna stay here.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.556
But the tension's nice.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.067
Reminds me of home.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.975
Finally.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.212
Now I can enjoy
the show in peace.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.712
Oh, this show is crap.

10:25.858 --> 10:27.792
- Feel funky
- Whoo!

10:27.860 --> 10:29.794
- Feel good
- Whoo!

10:29.862 --> 10:33.593
Gonna tell you
I'm in the neighborhood

10:33.666 --> 10:37.397
Gonna fly
like a bird on the wing

10:37.470 --> 10:41.873
Hold on to your hat, honey
Sing, sing, sing, sing

10:41.941 --> 10:45.672
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

10:45.745 --> 10:49.272
I got the music in me

10:49.348 --> 10:53.512
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

10:53.586 --> 10:55.884
I got the music in me

10:55.955 --> 10:57.923
Yeah

11:01.527 --> 11:04.257
Thank you. Thank you.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.561
And welcome to
<i>The Forman Bunch Variety Hour.</i>

11:07.633 --> 11:13.128
And, boy, do we have
a great show for you tonight.

11:13.205 --> 11:16.504
Sorry, Mom.
We can't stay for the show.

11:16.575 --> 11:19.442
<i>No!</i>

11:19.512 --> 11:21.605
Why not?

11:21.681 --> 11:26.550
Living at home is unbearable,
so we've decided to... run away.

11:26.619 --> 11:31.147
- <i>No!</i>
- Yea!

11:31.223 --> 11:33.123
So, thanks for everything,
Mrs. F.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.251
Well, you boys can't run away.

11:35.327 --> 11:38.262
Who's gonna do the square dance
with Shields and Yarnell?

11:38.330 --> 11:42.562
Well, let Laurie do it.
She's been makin' out with Shields all day.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.703
That's a lie!

11:49.675 --> 11:51.973
Well, when will I see you again?

11:52.044 --> 11:54.604
Don't worry, Kitty.
I'll take care of them.

11:56.682 --> 12:02.643
Ladies and gentlemen,
star of stage and screen, Shirley Jones.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.887
Hi, Mom.

12:08.961 --> 12:12.294
- Mom?
- That's right, Kitty.

12:12.364 --> 12:15.663
- We're Partridges now.
- This is gonna be great.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.260
I'm pretty sure
I can nail Susan Dey.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.667
No. Partridges?

12:25.745 --> 12:29.442
You can't live in a bus.
There's no toilet.

12:29.515 --> 12:35.351
Well, it may be inconvenient, Kitty, but
we do get to spend a lot of time together.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.720
That's right. Mrs. Partridge quit her job
to form a family band.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.021
Yep. It's all a matter
of choices, Kitty.

12:41.093 --> 12:44.585
I guess you just
chose to be a bad mother.

12:46.632 --> 12:50.227
Hey, Shirley. Can I come?
I play the tambourine.

12:50.302 --> 12:55.205
Oh, I'm sorry, Laurie.
No whores on my show.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.672
Oh, fine. Hey, Shields. Wait up!

13:06.018 --> 13:08.646
Aaah! Cuchi-cuchi-cuchi!

13:08.721 --> 13:11.747
- Whoa, whoa...
- Can it, Charo.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.815
Yeah!

13:17.563 --> 13:19.622
Well, I am not gonna
let that happen.

13:23.402 --> 13:26.963
Oh, no. This <i>is</i> crap.

13:47.225 --> 13:49.193
Oh, no. Honey.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.563
Yep. He thought
he could sneak out.

13:52.631 --> 13:56.158
So. What now, Ho Chi Minh?

13:56.234 --> 13:59.897
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Playtime is over.

13:59.971 --> 14:02.371
Your friends are no longer
allowed in the house.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.103
- Wait. What?
- No, no. We'll talk about it in the morning.

14:06.177 --> 14:08.839
Fine, we'll talk about it
in the morning.

14:10.949 --> 14:14.316
We'll talk about how your friends
are no longer allowed in the house.

14:16.454 --> 14:19.912
You know,
I have an interesting idea.

14:19.991 --> 14:22.186
Why don't
we <i>not</i> punish him?

14:22.260 --> 14:26.253
Why don't we try a little of that forgiveness
that Jesus was always talking about?

14:32.404 --> 14:36.670
No, no.
This is for his own good.

14:36.741 --> 14:39.972
Look, in order for Eric to be
a happy, well-adjusted adult...

14:40.045 --> 14:42.411
he has to be miserable now.

14:43.548 --> 14:46.415
That's just good parenting.

14:46.484 --> 14:48.509
If I was to be
Mr. Nice Guy now...

14:48.587 --> 14:51.613
do you know what would happen
to Eric in a few years?

14:51.690 --> 14:54.420
Do you?

14:54.492 --> 14:56.960
Oh, Eric. Breakfast.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.895
Well, there's
my sweet little baby boy.

15:08.306 --> 15:11.434
Why oh why
didn't I discipline you?

15:11.509 --> 15:13.602
Shut up and eat your cornflakes.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.309
That's what.

15:22.387 --> 15:27.381
Never surrender, Kitty.
Never retreat. We're winning.

15:27.459 --> 15:31.054
The fact that Eric was desperate enough
to climb out his window...

15:31.129 --> 15:33.529
shows that
everything is working.

15:42.207 --> 15:43.697
Surprise.

15:45.110 --> 15:49.444
This is so great.
I didn't... know you delivered.

15:51.549 --> 15:53.483
<i>Bed check, dumb-ass.</i>

15:53.551 --> 15:55.485
Holy crap.

15:56.788 --> 15:59.086
No, it is not a bed check.

15:59.157 --> 16:01.091
We just wanna say good night...

16:01.159 --> 16:03.923
and... and we love you very, very much.

16:03.995 --> 16:06.589
What are you doing?

16:06.665 --> 16:08.599
Oh, just nailing
his window shut.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.962
- For his own good.
- What if there's a fire?

16:13.038 --> 16:18.101
Well, then I guess you can just
light your dope with it, dopehead.

16:25.183 --> 16:27.117
Donna!

16:27.185 --> 16:30.382
- Get out.
- Whoa. Not so fast, Laurie.

16:35.994 --> 16:38.326
Oh. Ow! Ow!

16:38.396 --> 16:40.626
You idiot!
Red's doing bed checks.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.724
<i>Bed check.</i>

16:52.410 --> 16:56.608
And bless Mommy
and bless Daddy...

16:56.681 --> 16:59.115
and bless Grandma...

17:00.919 --> 17:03.149
Oh. Hi, Daddy.

17:04.155 --> 17:06.146
Sorry to bother you, kitten.

17:11.195 --> 17:14.256
Kelso, get your hand off my ass.

17:14.332 --> 17:16.266
- It was an accident.
- Shh!

17:16.334 --> 17:19.770
- It's still there.
- It's still an accident.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.829
- Kelso, it's still there!
- Yeah.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.101
You know, Steven...

17:26.176 --> 17:30.511
this hatred thing you have for me
is just you protecting yourself.

17:30.582 --> 17:32.914
- Okay.
- It's true.

17:32.984 --> 17:34.918
You're afraid to reach
the peaks of love...

17:34.986 --> 17:37.045
for fear of
being dropped off a cliff.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.790
Well, I'm your
safety line, Steven.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.929
So grab me.

17:48.032 --> 17:49.966
Go grab yourself, freak.

17:52.036 --> 17:54.231
<i>Okay, bed check. Here we come.</i>

17:54.305 --> 17:56.603
- Get out!
- <i>Kitty, you're warning him.</i>

17:56.674 --> 17:59.438
<i>I'm not warning anybody. Getting closer!</i>

18:02.947 --> 18:04.881
Okay, um...

18:04.949 --> 18:07.008
We just... We wanted to say good night...

18:07.085 --> 18:09.019
<i>And, um,</i>
<i>that you're a good boy...</i>

18:09.087 --> 18:13.524
and even though you do some things
that we don't like, we still love you.

18:13.591 --> 18:15.718
And I'm watching you.

18:18.763 --> 18:21.323
And I'm cherishing you.

18:26.838 --> 18:29.466
Oh, no, Jackie. They're still out there.

18:31.042 --> 18:33.875
What was that?
Oh, and they want our pants.

18:40.084 --> 18:42.018
You hear that?

18:42.086 --> 18:44.577
I don't hear anything.

18:46.191 --> 18:51.788
That's right. Nothing.
That's the sound of discipline.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.594
No, that's the sound of jail.

18:59.137 --> 19:02.231
This house used to be fun,
until you made it miserable.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.538
Well, I'm sorry, Kitty,
but I think it's working.

19:10.782 --> 19:14.115
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, I do.

19:14.185 --> 19:18.554
- Oh, you do?
- I just said I did.

19:18.623 --> 19:20.557
Red.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.855
Oh! Hell's bells!

19:22.927 --> 19:26.124
It's Red! Run for it!

19:27.632 --> 19:30.226
Freeze!

19:30.301 --> 19:33.099
Daddy, thank God you came.
They were kidnapping me!

19:34.873 --> 19:37.398
Oh, shut up. That's it.
I have had it.

19:37.475 --> 19:39.773
You know what this means?
More discipline.

19:39.844 --> 19:44.474
- No. No.
- Oh, yes. Playtime is over.

19:44.549 --> 19:46.813
Oh, stop saying that.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.512
Your cracking down
is not working.

19:50.588 --> 19:52.453
Hell, I could've
told him that a week ago.

19:54.425 --> 19:57.417
Now is not the time
to be a porky mouth.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.324
Red, I want my house back.

20:03.134 --> 20:06.501
- I once had an ant farm...
- Oh, honey, no. Not now.

20:08.940 --> 20:12.876
Okay. Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

20:12.944 --> 20:15.970
You are going to remember
that he's a good son...

20:16.047 --> 20:19.539
and you are going to remember
that he's a good father...

20:19.617 --> 20:22.381
because I am not happy
with the way this house is running.

20:22.453 --> 20:26.389
- Now you see what you've done? You've made your mother unhappy.
- No, he didn't.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.585
I'm not happy with everything.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.562
I'm not... I'm not happy
with windows being nailed shut...

20:32.630 --> 20:36.088
and I'm not... I'm not happy
with people sneaking around...

20:36.167 --> 20:39.534
and... and I'm not happy with
my Christmas bells on the front door.

20:41.172 --> 20:44.733
Well, Kitty, what do you want me to do?
Pretend that nothing happened?

20:44.809 --> 20:47.676
Yes.

20:47.745 --> 20:49.804
- No.
- Fine.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.179
Then... Then that's it.
Then I'm staying home.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.184
I'm staying home full-time,
and I am...

20:54.252 --> 20:56.948
I am taking back my house,
and that's the way it is.

20:57.021 --> 21:00.821
Now, you get upstairs and take
those nails out of the windows...

21:00.892 --> 21:04.487
and <i>you</i> stop being such
a sneaky smart mouth...

21:04.562 --> 21:09.090
and you... Honey, you've gotta
stop eating stuff off the floor.

21:09.167 --> 21:12.603
Now, everyone, let's just...

21:12.670 --> 21:15.833
Let's go back to happy.

21:22.981 --> 21:26.610
So, I guess... playtime is over.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.627
I'm sorry, I...

21:40.365 --> 21:44.426
I don't remember
growing older

21:44.502 --> 21:48.461
When did they

21:48.539 --> 21:50.632
- Sunrise
- Sunset

21:50.708 --> 21:52.938
- Sunrise
- Sunset

21:53.011 --> 21:56.606
Swiftly fly the years

21:56.681 --> 22:00.811
One season
following another

22:00.885 --> 22:04.844
Laden with
happiness and tears

22:04.922 --> 22:08.949
Give it to me one more time, cuchi!
