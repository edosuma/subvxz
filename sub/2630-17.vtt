00:03.795 --> 00:06.171
- Good! You guys are all here.
- Hey, what's up?

00:06.339 --> 00:09.967
Well, I have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.011
- Oh!
- Congratulations!

00:12.178 --> 00:15.055
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!

00:15.682 --> 00:18.726
- What?
- Well, I got this pair marked "XS."

00:18.893 --> 00:21.895
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.941
Anyway, I'm gonna be the coordinator
of the women's collection.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.611
I'll work right under the director.
It's the perfect job for me.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.156
Wow. Well, if you nail the interview,
you'll get it.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.450
- Yeah.
- Want to work on your interview skills?

00:34.617 --> 00:38.078
- Okay!
- Okay! Let's start with the handshake.

00:39.622 --> 00:40.748
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.000
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.668
- Thank you.
- Let me try.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.378
Okay.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.673
Oh, my God!
What did I ever do to you?

00:49.841 --> 00:51.258
Did I squeeze too hard?

00:51.426 --> 00:55.137
Let's just say
I'm glad I'm not Chandler.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.651
That's right, Ross. I can see you
in your new apartment. You see me.

01:50.819 --> 01:54.613
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.615
Is he doing his "shark attack" bit yet?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.493
No. Oh, wait! There he goes.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.425
Very funny, Ross.

02:15.593 --> 02:19.138
Very lifelike and funny. Okay.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.976
Oh, no, no, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.772
Whoa, maybe I was. Hey!

02:28.940 --> 02:32.234
Monica, this hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.654
Get in there, man.
Flirt back. Mix it up!

02:36.489 --> 02:38.490
Yeah, I'm down with that.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.327
Okay, here it goes.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.164
How...

02:45.540 --> 02:46.915
...you...

02:47.625 --> 02:49.418
...doing?

02:51.838 --> 02:55.257
It worked! She's waving me over.
I'll be right over.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.759
Let's see,
she's on the third floor...

02:58.219 --> 02:59.303
Wow.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.598
- She is pretty, huh?
- Tell me about it, huh?

03:02.765 --> 03:03.807
Oh, no, no.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.350
No, no! I'm not with her.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.728
Oh, that's just Monica.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.521
Blah!

03:26.789 --> 03:28.457
Hey, Joey!

03:28.625 --> 03:30.918
Great stuff, huh?

03:31.669 --> 03:34.546
- This is your place?
- Yeah, of course it is. Oh, come on in.

03:34.714 --> 03:39.051
Ooh, ohh. Uh, go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.764
But I counted.
You're not supposed to live here.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.307
Oh, man!

03:50.021 --> 03:51.772
- Unh!
- What happened?

03:51.940 --> 03:56.068
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.529
Damn! She's not there anymore.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.950
Oh, look, Ross is doing
his "watching TV" bit.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.455
No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.677
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.429
Okay, now I really have to go.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.641
It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...

04:27.809 --> 04:30.602
...just because some guy
shot at a store clerk.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.731
- I know, but it's my job.
- Then maybe I could come too?

04:34.899 --> 04:38.902
Suspect has
just emerged naked from the sewer.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.654
All right, you go.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.076
- Bye-bye.
- Okay. Bye.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.873
- Oh, God!
- What?

04:52.041 --> 04:54.126
Oh, I just miss him so much!

04:56.754 --> 04:58.630
Wow.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.674
For just a week,
you guys are close, huh?

05:00.842 --> 05:04.261
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it, though. He's so sweet.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.805
He's like this little puppy dog, you know?

05:06.973 --> 05:11.018
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.938
Ugh, I love the beginning parts
of relationships, you know?

05:15.106 --> 05:17.357
You can't keep your hands
off each other.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.526
- I know. It is the best. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

05:19.694 --> 05:23.363
God, how long did that last
for you and Chandler?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.908
What? It's still going on.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.995
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?

05:30.163 --> 05:34.541
I am serious. We're all over
each other all the time.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.211
Okay, you know where you are
better than I do. I was just curious.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.547
Why don't you just calm down,
Phoebe, all right?

05:41.674 --> 05:46.803
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.639
God, I woke the beast. Um...

05:50.975 --> 05:54.686
I was wrong obviously.
I just misspoke. It's okay.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.229
Well, it is okay. I mean...

05:56.397 --> 05:59.733
As long as you know Chandler and I
are also hot and fiery.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.401
I mean, just as hot as you.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.819
I mean, our flame...

06:02.987 --> 06:05.322
Whoo! It is on fire!

06:07.075 --> 06:08.617
Monica, here's your broom back.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.746
You are so cute.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.047
- Oh, hey! How'd the interview go?
- Ugh!

06:22.215 --> 06:26.176
Horrible! I did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.

06:26.344 --> 06:30.305
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?

06:30.973 --> 06:33.141
- No.
- So, what happened?

06:33.309 --> 06:36.770
Ugh, it was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.399
You know, like, I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat...

06:40.566 --> 06:46.696
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."

06:49.534 --> 06:51.410
Trust me. It was actually very funny.

06:51.577 --> 06:56.331
Anyway, so we were
saying goodbye and, uh... Ugh.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.543
- What happened?
- All right, we were shaking hands...

06:59.710 --> 07:03.255
...and he kind of leaned in toward me.
Maybe he was going to open the door.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.634
But I totally misread him and I, uh...

07:14.725 --> 07:16.601
You kissed him?

07:16.769 --> 07:18.979
I didn't know what else to do!

07:19.605 --> 07:21.189
Well, you could have tried...

07:21.357 --> 07:22.983
...not kissing him.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.818
Thanks, Chandler.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.112
Hey, Rach,
a guy from Ralph Lauren called.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.738
You got a second interview.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.408
- I can't believe it! I got a second interview.
- Yes!

07:31.576 --> 07:34.619
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?

07:34.787 --> 07:37.789
Wait a minute, wait. You don't think
that's why he wants me back?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.833
Yeah!

07:40.209 --> 07:41.835
No?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.171
Kiss? What are you talking about?

07:44.338 --> 07:47.215
Ugh, I accidentally kissed him
in the interview...

07:47.383 --> 07:49.217
...and now he wants me back of course...

07:49.385 --> 07:53.388
...because, "Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody"!

07:55.099 --> 07:56.183
Come on, Rach.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.811
What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl
that'll just sleep with him?

07:59.979 --> 08:02.397
He wants you back
because you're right for the job.

08:02.565 --> 08:06.443
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?

08:06.611 --> 08:08.153
Oh, Rachel, look, don't say that.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.697
I think you just need a hug
from Joey. Heh.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.408
Come on. Come on, ha-ha-ha.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.077
She's back! Hot girl's back!

08:16.245 --> 08:19.789
Aw, well, I'm not totally back yet.
But I appreciate it.

08:19.957 --> 08:23.376
No, in Ross' building. She's back!
She's back!

08:23.544 --> 08:25.670
Okay, wait there. I'll be over in a second.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.340
One, two, three. Got it!

08:32.345 --> 08:34.763
I gotta check out this hot girl.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.474
There she is!

08:45.233 --> 08:47.776
Damn it! Did you move?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.861
Yes.

08:50.029 --> 08:53.323
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.036
I'm Ross.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.797
Yes?

09:11.092 --> 09:12.551
Uh...

09:12.718 --> 09:15.178
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?

09:16.264 --> 09:19.307
No, I'm all alone.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.309
Yeah. Sorry about that.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.527
Oh. Hey, little girl.

09:30.695 --> 09:35.240
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter
by any chance, a hot girl?

09:36.242 --> 09:39.536
- Daddy!
- Later, girl! Aah.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.750
Oh, man!

09:48.421 --> 09:50.255
Hot girl?

09:52.091 --> 09:53.800
Hot girl!

09:58.764 --> 10:00.890
- Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
- Hi. Okay.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.476
- Ahem.
- It's nice to see you again.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.145
Thank you.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.522
Oh, Rachel, uh...

10:08.858 --> 10:11.318
- What?
- Just, uh...

10:11.485 --> 10:13.069
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, let me...

10:13.237 --> 10:14.279
Whoa, eh, oh!

10:14.447 --> 10:17.741
All right. Okay, I see what's going on here.
Now, listen, look...

10:17.908 --> 10:20.201
...I am sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

10:20.369 --> 10:24.539
But I am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.749
- Now... Eh, eh!
- Well...

10:25.916 --> 10:28.376
Even though I kissed you,
that does not give you...

10:28.544 --> 10:33.423
...the right to demand sex from me!
I do not want this job that bad.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.175
Good day, sir.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.600
Ugh, you are not gonna believe...

10:43.768 --> 10:46.519
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me.

10:50.566 --> 10:54.027
Okay, that's amazing.
How did you know that?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.279
You got ink on your lip.

10:56.447 --> 11:01.409
Oh.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.584
What do you say, maybe,
sometime I hold your gun?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.753
I don't know.
We're not supposed to do that.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.171
What could happen? I mean...

11:16.050 --> 11:18.343
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.222
Do you want to see a movie
after dinner tonight?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.349
Oh, we can't. We already have plans.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.267
What are you doing?

11:26.435 --> 11:30.897
Um, well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.109
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.279
But have fun at the movie.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.575
Uh, ha, ha.
Well, we're not seeing a movie.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.370
You're not? Why did you ask us
if we wanted to go?

11:45.538 --> 11:49.374
Oh, um, because I just wanted
to know what you were doing...

11:49.542 --> 11:52.711
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...

11:52.962 --> 11:55.255
...while we were doing it all night.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.509
- Will you excuse me just a second? Okay.
- Yeah.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.681
Chandler? Can I see you for a second?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.766
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay, heh.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.563
- We have got to beat them!
- Why?

12:11.731 --> 12:15.358
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than we are.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.694
- Oh! So?
- So?

12:18.320 --> 12:22.282
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!

12:22.742 --> 12:25.744
You have got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.495
Just to impress Gary and Phoebe...

12:27.663 --> 12:30.415
...you want me to go upstairs
and have sex over and over...

12:30.583 --> 12:33.668
...and I'm saying no to this why?
Get your coat!

12:44.805 --> 12:46.848
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.308
Excuse me.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.398
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.818
Apparently, he's running around
looking for some kind of hot girl.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.655
Who isn't?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.414
I don't think we've met. I'm Ross.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.835
I know. You're the guy who
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.922
Never mind.

13:19.757 --> 13:23.426
No, I actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.637
I mean, you had just moved in.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.306
I had just moved in!

13:28.474 --> 13:30.266
Thank you!

13:31.185 --> 13:33.019
Listen, um...

13:33.229 --> 13:34.854
- Jen.
- Jen.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.065
I know this may sound a little:

13:40.945 --> 13:44.239
But, uh, would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.116
Sure, that would be nice.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.868
- Um...
- Oh.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.622
My number's on there.
Give me a call.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.916
I will give you a call. Heh.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.960
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.259
I forgot my paper.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.474
- That was amazing.
- Ugh.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.520
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.314
That was amazing.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.526
We are the hottest, huh?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.320
No one is hotter than we are.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.031
- We're the best.
- No, you're the best.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.241
Aw.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.452
- No, you're the best.
- No, you're the best.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.663
I am the best.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.625
Hey, guys.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.210
What you been doing?

14:44.508 --> 14:47.760
Hey, Joey, isn't that the girl
who waved at you the other day?

14:47.928 --> 14:50.680
I don't know,
but I can see through your sheet.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.311
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
But you know what? It doesn't matter.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.354
- I'm never gonna meet her anyways.
- Why?

14:58.522 --> 15:00.648
Because it's impossible
to find her apartment!

15:00.816 --> 15:04.527
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.030
What are you talking about?

15:07.197 --> 15:10.533
She lives on the 2nd floor,
7th apartment from the left.

15:10.701 --> 15:14.662
No, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor,
8th apartment from the left.

15:14.830 --> 15:18.082
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.753
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.131
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.

15:25.299 --> 15:28.217
I almost lost another girl
because of counting!

15:31.305 --> 15:32.388
So, uh, you ready?

15:32.556 --> 15:34.182
- Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
- Okay.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.894
- Could you get that?
- Sure.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.780
- Joey...?
- Aah! No! No!

15:55.037 --> 15:59.499
Uh, first, I would like to say thank you
for agreeing to see me again.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.000
That's, uh, quite all right.

16:01.168 --> 16:05.505
But I feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.718
Okay. Um.

16:10.886 --> 16:15.431
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...

16:15.599 --> 16:17.809
...and, uh, for yelling at you.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.686
Fair enough.

16:19.853 --> 16:23.564
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who, uh...

16:23.732 --> 16:27.110
Who did... Who did not, um, ahem...

16:27.277 --> 16:29.654
...yell at you and storm out.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.657
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.

16:32.908 --> 16:37.370
I made a huge fool of myself,
and I came back. That shows courage.

16:37.997 --> 16:42.041
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.793
That shows integrity.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.754
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...

16:47.006 --> 16:49.215
...and that shows courage.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.801
Okay, ahem.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.929
Now, I know that I've
already said courage...

16:55.180 --> 16:57.557
...but you've got to have courage.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.101
And, um, finally...

17:00.269 --> 17:03.563
...when I thought you were making
sexual advances in the workplace...

17:03.731 --> 17:06.065
...I said no, and I was not litigious.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.276
So there you go. You got courage...

17:08.444 --> 17:12.113
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...

17:12.281 --> 17:15.032
...and not litigious.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.411
Look, Mr...

17:19.621 --> 17:20.788
- Zelner.
- Zelner!

17:20.955 --> 17:22.248
I knew that!

17:22.415 --> 17:24.375
Oh, I knew that.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.003
I really, really want this job.

17:28.213 --> 17:32.258
And I think I would be really good at it.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.971
You know what?

17:38.640 --> 17:41.142
I may regret this, but, uh...

17:42.019 --> 17:44.228
...I'm gonna give you a shot.
- Oh, you are?

17:44.396 --> 17:45.855
- Mm-hm.
- Really?

17:46.023 --> 17:49.484
Oh, thank you. Oh, God!

17:49.902 --> 17:52.528
Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?

17:52.696 --> 17:53.863
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.200
Well, how about a handshake? Ha-ha-ha.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.993
Aah! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

18:01.080 --> 18:04.665
Oh, God, I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!

18:05.084 --> 18:07.001
There! Uh, there. Um...

18:07.169 --> 18:09.128
Okay, so, thank you.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.090
I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.925
Hey, I'll see you Monday.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.224
- Are you tired?
- You better believe he's tired...

18:21.391 --> 18:23.059
...after the day we had!

18:23.227 --> 18:26.062
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?

18:26.730 --> 18:29.482
Honey? The tortilla chips
know what you mean.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.277
So, uh, Chandler,
do you like that badge I got you?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.488
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.368
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10-100.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.330
That's pee-pee.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.336
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.089
Oh, ha, ha. Um...

18:53.257 --> 18:56.217
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.

18:56.385 --> 19:00.054
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so...

19:00.222 --> 19:02.640
- You didn't.
- We did!

19:02.808 --> 19:07.520
Ha, ha. We violated section 12,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.733
- The park, huh?
- Ha, ha.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.195
- Public place.
Uh-huh.

19:16.363 --> 19:19.574
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?

19:28.625 --> 19:30.209
Hi, Chandler.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.712
Monica, this is the men's room.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.423
Isn't it?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.010
Yes, it is.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.763
But see, I've always found
the men's bathroom very sexual.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.641
- Haven't you?
- No.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.769
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.439
This is getting ridiculous.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.233
- Come on, we can't let them win!
- Uh...

19:54.401 --> 19:58.946
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?

19:59.114 --> 20:02.950
Phoebe and Gary are in that "can't keep
their hands off each other" phase!

20:04.328 --> 20:05.578
- So?
- So.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.832
It makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.877
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.673
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were, you know...

20:17.925 --> 20:20.176
...all over each other all the time?

20:20.344 --> 20:23.804
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.350
But to tell you the truth,
I'm more excited about where we are now.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.685
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:29.853 --> 20:32.897
I've never been in a relationship
that's lasted this long before.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.651
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other?

20:36.818 --> 20:38.945
I think that's pretty incredible.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.948
And the fact that
this is happening with you...

20:42.366 --> 20:44.492
...I think that's pretty exciting.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.123
That's so sweet.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.169
I know that I was acting
a little crazy...

20:56.213 --> 20:58.631
...but I feel the same way.
- Mm?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.304
You know what I just realized?

21:05.514 --> 21:07.640
You just freaked out
about our relationship.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.725
- Pfft, I did not.
- Yes, you did!

21:09.893 --> 21:11.394
Admit it. You freaked out!

21:12.646 --> 21:14.105
I freaked out a little.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.024
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?

21:17.276 --> 21:19.277
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.

21:19.486 --> 21:24.031
I am the relationship king,
and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!

21:29.329 --> 21:30.955
And now we're back.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.968
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.470
- Thank God. I can't watch him anymore.
- Ha-ha-ha.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.806
- You guys ready for the movies?
- Yeah.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.018
Oh, by the way, thank you for
loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.

21:54.062 --> 21:57.148
Man, they cannot get enough!
