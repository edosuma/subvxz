WEBVTT

00:08.426 --> 00:10.344
ladies and gentle bitches.

00:10.344 --> 00:14.223
Brian of Off-Brian fame.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.475
Kip, kill the montage!

00:18.602 --> 00:20.563
<i>After 15 years</i>
<i>at Hiroki Hassan's</i>

00:20.563 --> 00:23.315
<i>Latrine Fashion House,</i>
<i>Brian said, "Boy, bye,"</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:26.110
<i>and has taken the fashion world</i>
<i>by storm ever since.</i>

00:26.110 --> 00:28.904
Dua Lipa, who are you wearing?

00:28.904 --> 00:31.407
Only one person could have
designed this dress.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.702
- Off-Brian.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.871
Why should your mouth
have all the fun?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.497
- Dasani Nuu.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.583
Water for your whole face.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.795
We've got a great
a show tonight.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.756
- Yung Polluter is here.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.549
Stick around.
We'll be right back.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.217
Oh, Brian, over here.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.053
How is your relationship
with Hiroki Hassan?

00:53.053 --> 00:57.308
Hiroki Hassan is so last season.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.823
Oh, damn, bruh.

01:12.823 --> 01:15.409
Brian's got me wanting to cop
patio chairs and water bottles

01:15.409 --> 01:17.077
- like a soccer mom.
- Facts.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.246
Bro, I heard
he's doing this Ikea collab

01:19.246 --> 01:21.457
where he crosses a Fjardîng
with a Bigåraa.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.459
Like, dawg,
I'm moving to Sweden.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.920
Brian's got everyone
stepping their branding game up.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.297
You see the Triangle emancipated
from their parents

01:28.297 --> 01:29.715
and moved into
an influencer house.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.717
And Melody's
on the come-up, too.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.761
She's got a number one single
on Spotify,

01:33.761 --> 01:37.264
and she's donating the royalties
to Hoarders Without Borders.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.808
I thought I was the woke one!

01:38.808 --> 01:40.935
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

01:40.935 --> 01:42.686
Beep, beep.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.855
Who's ready
for a sleepover, y'all?

01:44.855 --> 01:47.691
- This little boy is.
- Oh!
- Ah, that ain't...

01:47.691 --> 01:51.278
We need to step our shit up,
or we're gonna get left behind.

01:52.363 --> 01:57.034
<i>for our lives to be over...</i>

01:57.034 --> 02:00.371
Ooh. Oh, I'm a fucking genius.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.289
Brianna?!

02:06.836 --> 02:08.629
Brianna, it's time.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.631
Announce the drop.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.633
Ugh. Can it wait
until after dinner?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.385
Brianna make chicken casserole.

02:14.385 --> 02:17.346
He's a fashion genius, Terry.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.223
The casserole can
fucking wait.

02:19.223 --> 02:23.310
Now, my liege, tennis ball shoes
or the baguette vest?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.229
Let's do the tennis ball shoes.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.231
Hon, it's one thing
if he wants to stay here,

02:27.231 --> 02:30.150
but when you start calling
your idiot brother "My Liege"...

02:30.150 --> 02:31.861
- Okay, pop quiz, fam.

02:31.861 --> 02:35.072
Who here runs
an international fashion house?

02:35.072 --> 02:37.449
I know. I know.
It's my brother Brian.

02:37.449 --> 02:41.495
And who here is the assistant
manager at a fucking Best Buy?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.497
This fucking idiot right here.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.541
Sorry, Terry.
I-I love you so much.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.836
The next time I need help with
my fucking Sonos, I'll ask.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.546
Why are you even here?

02:50.546 --> 02:52.923
Didn't Dasani just pay you
a million dollars

02:52.923 --> 02:54.425
to design their water bottle?

02:54.425 --> 02:58.596
I'm reinvesting that money
into the brand, dipshit.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.473
Now, Brianna, announce the drop.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.102
Hey, it's Brianna.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.563
Yeah, the tennis ball shoes.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.648
Fucking drop it!

03:13.360 --> 03:14.862
<i>And</i>

03:14.862 --> 03:17.281
Uno. Man, I'm getting tired
of whipping you guys.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.702
Yo, yo, yo, yo! Fuck your
"draw twos" and fuck this game!

03:21.702 --> 03:23.746
Surprise Off-Brian drop!

03:23.746 --> 03:26.123
Holy shit! It's the Wilson
tennis ball shoe collab.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.125
It's made
from recycled tennis balls.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.169
Yo, upcycling is the wave.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.880
Yeah, that's some
avant-garde type shit.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.757
Great ankle support.

03:34.757 --> 03:37.676
Who wants hot cocoa
and slipper cobbler?

03:37.676 --> 03:39.094
- Yeah.
- Hey, hell, yeah.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.471
- Slipper cob in the hizzy.
- Extra mallows

03:40.471 --> 03:42.681
- for me, please.
- Ugh! That's it!

03:42.681 --> 03:45.059
Gang gang meeting
in Dale's room right now.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.602
This is unacceptable.

03:46.602 --> 03:49.104
If everyone at school cops
the new Off-Brian

03:49.104 --> 03:51.357
while we're stuck here
sipping hot cocoa

03:51.357 --> 03:53.359
and playing <i>Uno</i> like babies,

03:53.359 --> 03:55.110
I'm-a wipe my Gram.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.654
Benny, you love hot cocoa.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.197
I do,
but that's besides the point.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.407
Look, we're big kids now,

04:00.407 --> 04:02.576
and big kids camp out
in line overnight

04:02.576 --> 04:04.244
to get the fire drops.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.829
I don't know, dawg.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.748
Fairfax at night is
a whole 'nother beast.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.208
Are you sure
we're ready for this?

04:09.208 --> 04:10.709
We got this, fam.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.544
Derica rescued a fucking whale,

04:12.544 --> 04:13.921
Truman's savvy A.F.,

04:13.921 --> 04:15.339
Dale's a cloud scout,

04:15.339 --> 04:17.091
- and I got the street cred.
- Shit.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.635
Benny's right.
We can do this.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.887
The only thing we got
to figure out is how the hell

04:21.887 --> 04:23.472
we're gonna sneak out
of this prison.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.475
Dad, we're gonna camp out
in line overnight!

04:26.475 --> 04:28.102
Killer idea, D-bone.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.063
I've been wanting to take you
guys camping for a long time.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.148
Uh-huh. Hey, Dad,
please don't be mad, but

04:33.148 --> 04:35.150
I think
this one might be crew only.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.778
Wow.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.988
Uh, okay.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.614
Don't cry. Um,

04:40.614 --> 04:43.784
you know what? I-I got something
I want to give you.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.120
I was gonna wait to give this
to you for your bar mitzvah,

04:46.120 --> 04:49.331
but tonight,
you're officially a big boy,

04:49.331 --> 04:54.837
so it's only right
we bust out the big boy tent.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.171
Wow-wee!

04:56.171 --> 04:58.215
There.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.718
Ah.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.761
Uh, what's happening?

05:02.761 --> 05:05.472
You know how white people be.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.434
Oh, my little baby
is growing up so fast!

05:08.434 --> 05:11.228
You know, son, I proposed
to Trini in this tent.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.147
Now, that's real big boy stuff.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.274
Oh, my God.
I don't know what to say.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.692
I'm honored.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.110
I knew you would be.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.862
Just got a few quick rules
to go through.

05:19.862 --> 05:24.283
big boys bring the tent home.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.702
It is the most important one.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.204
Commandments two
have fun.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.165
Now get out of here
before we call your parents

05:31.165 --> 05:32.958
and tell 'em
you're camping out unsupervised.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.918
- Love you.
- Good night.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.712
Hey, yo, Dale,
I can't wait to camp out

05:36.712 --> 05:38.964
in the tent
that your parents fucked in.

05:52.311 --> 05:56.231
Look at us, camping out.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.984
This is some pretty major
big-boy stuff right here.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.070
Jesus. Dale,
"big person stuff."

06:01.070 --> 06:03.238
Y'all are some
musty-ass misogynists.

06:04.156 --> 06:07.117
Kind of feels weird
on this side of the street, huh?

06:07.117 --> 06:09.495
No, dawg.
It's, like, way cleaner.

06:09.495 --> 06:10.996
- Yo. Oh, my God, guys,

06:10.996 --> 06:12.539
- we are next to Guy In Tent.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.958
- Who?
- Guy In Tent?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.877
Yo, he's a Fairfax lej.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.879
Did someone say my name?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.589
Guy In Tent.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.508
Nice to meet you,
my little homies.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.052
Honored to be in such good
tent company, Mr. Guy.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.720
- Yo, Guy In Tent, is it true

06:26.720 --> 06:28.138
that you were there the night

06:28.138 --> 06:30.599
Hiroki dropped
the Latrine baby wipes?

06:30.599 --> 06:33.519
Oh, I was there, my homies,
and I'm still wiping.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.354
- Oh, shit!

06:35.354 --> 06:39.525
May I present to you
the big boy tent?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.235
- Oh!

06:41.235 --> 06:43.946
Oh, my God!

06:43.946 --> 06:45.614
Okay, Dale, I see you.
She works.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.825
Ooh, ooh, finally.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.661
Slippy cob time, boy.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.789
Holy shit!
It's Post Malone!

06:53.789 --> 06:55.582
- Where?
- Let me see.
- No.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.460
False alarm.
It's just the garbage man.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.087
- Ugh.
- What?
- Damn it.

07:00.087 --> 07:04.091
Uh, Dale,
where'd the fuck-tent go?

07:04.091 --> 07:07.594
Oh, God. I broke
the first commandment!

07:07.594 --> 07:11.265
No!

07:11.265 --> 07:13.392
- Shit. Are you serious?
- Where we gonna sleep, huh?

07:13.392 --> 07:15.477
It's okay. I'm a big boy,

07:15.477 --> 07:17.688
and big boys bring the tent home

07:17.688 --> 07:19.690
as specified
in the tent commandments.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.192
Who am I kidding?
My dad's gonna kill me!

07:22.192 --> 07:23.610
- Look, not to be a buzzkill,

07:23.610 --> 07:25.028
but maybe we should
just call it.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.488
It's kind of cold,
and this jacket is

07:26.488 --> 07:27.906
- purely aesthetic, so...

07:27.906 --> 07:29.408
Yeah. No tent, no food.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.826
Man, let's just
go back to Dale's

07:30.826 --> 07:32.161
and crush some slippy cobbies.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.163
- Hey, lock it up right now.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.789
It's one all-nighter.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.749
I've played Fortnite
for longer stretches than this.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.085
You're right. If we don't
show up to school on Monday

07:40.085 --> 07:42.296
in the Off-Brian tennies, we
might as well delete ourselves.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.257
- Ugh.
- Yo, Dale, look. Check it.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.176
Maybe that security cam
caught the thief.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.468
Oh, thank the tent gods.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.970
Derica, you're a genius.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.430
Of course. I got you, Dale.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.348
We're gonna Dora the Explorer
this bitch.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.892
BRB.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.352
Yo, Benny, I hate to do this,

07:57.352 --> 07:59.021
but would you mind
if I got something to eat?

07:59.021 --> 08:00.439
I don't want to hang here alone.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.773
Why don't you just ask
Derica and Dale

08:01.773 --> 08:03.108
to bring you something back?

08:03.108 --> 08:05.986
And spend $30
on a limp-ass turkey sando?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.613
Okay, no.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.157
I'm gonna be back
in a minute, B. Trust.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.535
Cool. No prob.
I'll just be here chilling.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.704
- All alone.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.831
Yo, yo, yo,
look at this little bitch,

08:17.831 --> 08:20.125
still wearing
that Latrine bullshit.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.835
What a joke.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.672
Oh, fuck.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.091
Hiding your Latrine hoodie?

08:28.091 --> 08:30.385
Mm, seems kind of sus, bro.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.055
Man, stay in your fucking lane,
Guy In Tent.

08:34.848 --> 08:38.435
Wow. It's so different
at night.

08:38.435 --> 08:42.814
I mean, would you just look at
all these big boys... and girls.

08:42.814 --> 08:46.193
Hey, what are you kids
doing out so late?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.070
Philly Phyll,
I'm gonna need access

08:48.070 --> 08:49.488
to your security cameras.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.281
Ah, sorry, kids.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.284
Our cameras haven't
worked since '89

08:54.284 --> 08:59.164
when the sex was dirty
and the air was clean.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.000
How about some sodies
and pickles?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.919
<i>Coffee.</i>

09:03.919 --> 09:06.046
Actually, you know what?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.589
Hey, uh, make, uh, two coffees.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.425
No, Derica.
You're on the list.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.219
What list?

09:12.219 --> 09:15.055
Oh,
come on, Phyllis!

09:15.055 --> 09:16.640
Sure, I had a couple
jittery episodes,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.016
but it was a long time ago.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.351
Bitch, I can handle it.

09:19.351 --> 09:23.563
Normally, I wouldn't give
two Tommy Lee shits,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.565
but it's a coffee moon.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.446
You know what? Okay, fine.
How about a cup for Dale?

09:31.446 --> 09:33.532
If we're gonna be up all night
looking for this tent,

09:33.532 --> 09:35.158
he could really use
a pick-me-up.

09:35.158 --> 09:40.455
Don't... let... her... drink it.

09:41.957 --> 09:45.502
Oh, yeah. Oh,
it's the crappy stuff, huh?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.963
Go ahead, Dale.
Dive in.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.927
I got to go to the bathroom.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.137
- Excuse me.

09:56.388 --> 09:59.099
Hello, old friend.

09:59.099 --> 10:03.061
Oh, I'm so hungry right now.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.522
Hey. Ooh.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.773
Okay.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.400
Then I quit.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.901
- Here, kid.
- Huh?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.570
Quitting on Off-Brian night?!

10:11.570 --> 10:14.656
<i>Va Fangul.</i>
Hey, kid, you know how to cook?

10:14.656 --> 10:16.700
Uh, no, but I listen
to a lot of Future.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.744
- Whip it, stir it, sift it.
- Perfect.

10:18.744 --> 10:22.289
Come with me.
You're my new head chef.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.252
Raul, where the hell are you?

10:27.252 --> 10:28.754
Raul, this is...

10:28.754 --> 10:30.255
- Truman.
- Hey, Truman.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.133
- What's up, my man?
- He's the new head chef.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.427
We're back-ordered
up the ass right now,

10:35.427 --> 10:37.512
so let's move! Move!

10:37.512 --> 10:41.183
Okay, Truman, you're seen
<i>Ratatouille</i> over 100 times.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.477
You've got this, bro.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.978
- You know,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.938
a lot of people
don't like peeing in the trough,

10:46.938 --> 10:48.440
but you really do
get a sense of commun...

10:48.440 --> 10:49.941
Hey, what happened to the...?

10:49.941 --> 10:50.942
Oh, shit. Dale, look!

10:53.111 --> 10:54.863
- My tent!
- Let's move!

10:54.863 --> 10:58.367
A wop bop a loo bop
a lop ba boo. Yeah!

11:04.081 --> 11:05.749
What's goodie, hype beasts?!

11:05.749 --> 11:08.627
Give it up for the main man
in my life and yours,

11:08.627 --> 11:11.588
my big bro
by 15 seconds-- Brian!

11:11.588 --> 11:13.006
- Get up.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.717
- Oh, my God, he's here.
- No way.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.053
Up top. How we doing, Fairfax?

11:18.053 --> 11:21.181
Damn. Hiroki would never
mingle with the peasants.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.101
Oh, snap. Looks
like he's coming over here.

11:27.813 --> 11:29.898
You're not gonna have clout,

11:29.898 --> 11:32.484
much less be allowed
in a Latrine store

11:32.484 --> 11:34.069
ever again.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.114
Hey, Benny, right?

11:37.114 --> 11:39.616
- Uh... uh.
- From the Golden Dorito thing.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.159
How you been, dawg?

11:41.159 --> 11:44.079
- I, uh, been good.
- Oh, that's awesome, man.

11:44.079 --> 11:47.290
Hey, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask Brianna.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.585
You know, she's my twin, so we
got a little ESP thing going on.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.087
Later.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.588
You know Brian?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.215
Yeah. Oh, yeah, totally.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.717
- We go way back.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.846
- Let's go!

12:00.846 --> 12:02.389
They went this way, D!

12:11.356 --> 12:12.607
Whoa.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.942
My dad would
love this place.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.111
- What?

12:16.111 --> 12:17.487
- Oh!
- Aah!

12:17.487 --> 12:19.197
Thanks, Diego.
Thanks, Maurice.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.074
Derica, it's the plug!

12:21.074 --> 12:24.119
Maybe Joaquin knows
where my tent is.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.039
Yeah, you should talk to him.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.041
Look, I'm gonna snoop around,
see what I can find.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.210
Excuse me, Mr. Quine?

12:32.210 --> 12:33.795
Oh, hey, my little Padawan.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.922
You come to muse
on the nature of tents

12:35.922 --> 12:38.633
and their greater meaning
as a construct in society?

12:38.633 --> 12:41.678
Hi. Would you be a doll
and hold my legs?

12:41.678 --> 12:44.181
- Ha. Yeah.
- ...various styles

12:44.181 --> 12:45.765
developed over time.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.684
Oh, hold up. Mmm.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.479
Kohte, lavvu, yurt.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.230
I don't mean
to interrupt the tent expert,

12:52.230 --> 12:54.357
but I lost my tent, and I was
hoping you might have seen it.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.277
There's only one language
I speak, and it's art.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.945
Draw it for me.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.447
I mean, sure, right.
I know. I mean, I haven't

13:00.447 --> 13:01.907
championed a cause
into the spotlight,

13:01.907 --> 13:04.493
but that's because
I'm spread so thin championing

13:04.493 --> 13:06.286
all the coffees! Causes.
I mean, causes!

13:06.286 --> 13:09.080
Yeah. No. I'm sorry,
little dude, I haven't seen it.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.582
Dale, Dale,
Dale, Dale, Dale.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.792
Come on! I got a hot lead.
I know where your tent is!

13:12.792 --> 13:15.003
Whoa. Nice!
See you, Joaquin!

13:18.006 --> 13:20.884
Yeah, babe, it went
just as I planned.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.887
He's my baby,
and he will always be my baby.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.514
Like that Mariah Carey song.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.182
Besides, I'm gonna
bring it right back.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.350
I just want
to teach him a le...

13:28.350 --> 13:31.269
- Oh, shit. The tent!

13:35.732 --> 13:37.150
Order up!

13:37.150 --> 13:39.986
Oh, shit, Truman!

13:39.986 --> 13:43.698
Did you just serve
barbecue fettucine to Tommy G?

13:43.698 --> 13:46.743
- Maybe.
- Oh, my man!

13:46.743 --> 13:48.036
Oh, no!

13:48.036 --> 13:50.413
Oh, shit.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.831
I think I screwed up, Raul.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.920
Who's responsible
for the barbecue fettucine?

13:58.630 --> 13:59.839
It's a hit!

13:59.839 --> 14:02.759
- Yo.
- Truman, you're a genius!

14:02.759 --> 14:04.553
Ten more orders! Stat.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.639
Oh, hell, yeah!
Give me some, Truman.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.475
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hot behind.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.477
You call that a pan sear?

14:12.477 --> 14:13.853
Do it again.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.439
Well, that's the thing
about women, Truman.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.942
Forget everything
you know about Italy.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.070
Remember everything
you know about Texas.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.364
Here on <i>Diners, Drive-ins</i>
<i>and Dives,</i> I heard

14:24.364 --> 14:27.534
a 12-year-old was serving up
authentic barbecue fettucine

14:27.534 --> 14:29.202
on Fairfax.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.079
This is Don Pardo's.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.915
Oh. Ah. Money.

14:33.915 --> 14:37.168
The first thing you pick up
is the smoke off the brisket.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.336
It's unctuous.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.298
- And the pasta-- al dente.
- Hey.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.717
<i>- BFFs forever,</i>

14:43.717 --> 14:46.428
- Truman?
- BFFs forever, Raul!

14:47.637 --> 14:50.599
Man, being an adult
fucking rules!

14:50.599 --> 14:52.392
And then I told Hiroki,

14:52.392 --> 14:54.477
"Monorail? What is this,
fucking Epcot?"

14:56.479 --> 15:00.358
Oh. Goddamn it, that's funny.
Another bite of tri-tip, Benny?

15:00.358 --> 15:03.945
- Mmm.
- Yo, Benny,
if you're such a Brian stan,

15:03.945 --> 15:06.448
why you got a Latrine hoodie
tied around your waist?

15:06.448 --> 15:09.034
Uh, it's a... a diaper.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.870
You know, in case I need to drop
a deuce while I wait in line.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.456
- That makes sense.
- Uh, wish I had done that.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.291
If you truly don't
give a shit about Latrine,

15:16.291 --> 15:19.085
why don't you boot that diaper
into the street, cuh?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.503
Because I want to save it

15:20.503 --> 15:23.465
for when I actually need
to poo, cuh.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.634
I say he boots it.
Who's with me?

15:25.634 --> 15:28.678
Boot it! Boot it! Boot it!

15:28.678 --> 15:31.598
Okay, okay. You want to know
how hard I ride for Brian?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.558
Check this out. Litter gang!

15:36.019 --> 15:39.064
Yeah. Ha, ha. Fuck Latrine!

15:41.900 --> 15:44.361
Truman! A word.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.156
I need you to fire Raul.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.742
Fire Raul?! But he's the heart
and soul of this restaurant.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.744
Well, he's gonna be
the heart and soul

15:52.744 --> 15:54.537
of the unemployment line.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.456
We don't need him.
We have you.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.583
Oh, do I have to, Don Pardo?

15:58.583 --> 15:59.876
Sorry, Truman.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.461
You want to be the head chef,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.797
you got to act like
the head chef.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.967
Oh, God.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.721
This is it. This is the lead

16:11.721 --> 16:14.015
that's gonna crack this bitch
wide open.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.019
A coffee shop?

16:18.019 --> 16:19.646
Wait a minute. What the heck
does this have to do

16:19.646 --> 16:20.897
- with my tent?
- Nothing. I lied.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.899
I just wanted more coffee.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.317
<i>Hola, brujas.</i>

16:24.317 --> 16:26.361
I want the strongest coffee
you have.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.863
Don't fucking play with me!
The good shit!

16:28.863 --> 16:32.951
Right this way, my pretty.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.788
She's here, my witches.

16:36.788 --> 16:40.125
The prophecy has come true!

16:40.125 --> 16:42.168
Please, D. Let's go.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.129
Has a prophecy ever
been a good thing?

16:46.172 --> 16:49.008
One raven's feather,

16:49.008 --> 16:51.511
one milk of almond,

16:51.511 --> 16:54.764
one frog leg and a...

16:54.764 --> 16:56.933
packet of Stevia!

16:59.102 --> 17:01.312
Derica, no! Don't drink it!

17:01.312 --> 17:03.565
Eat a dick, Dale.
I need the café con leche.

17:07.861 --> 17:08.945
Ah!

17:12.741 --> 17:14.492
The coffee moon
is upon us, Dale.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.202
You're too late!

17:18.621 --> 17:20.623
- Oh, no.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.167
She's a Dere-wolf.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.549
It's just a hoodie, Benny.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.426
Camo's fucking stupid anyway.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.889
It's okay.
It'll come out in the wash.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.310
Aah!

17:40.310 --> 17:42.645
Hey, you, you want to see
a little Korean boy cry?

17:42.645 --> 17:44.314
Yeah, man. Give him the juice.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.732
Kobe.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.320
Make it stop.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.614
- What's troubling you, my G?

17:54.157 --> 17:56.326
I'm king of the line,
Guy In Tent.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.454
I can't help but feel
like part of me is dying.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.872
Maybe it's because

18:00.872 --> 18:03.166
my dope-as-fuck
Latrine hoodie was shat on.

18:03.166 --> 18:07.587
Ah, heavy is the head
that wears the hype crown.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.713
It was my first cop.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.715
I became a hype beast

18:10.715 --> 18:12.717
<i>the day I put that hoodie on.</i>

18:12.717 --> 18:13.843
<i>It changed my life.</i>

18:13.843 --> 18:15.845
Before that hoodie,

18:15.845 --> 18:17.013
I was just another
basic Kumon bitch.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.182
And look at you now, my G.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.643
Chasing clout through the night.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.853
Maybe I'm forcing
this whole Off-Brian thing.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.314
I mean, normally,
I'm all about that new new,

18:26.314 --> 18:30.777
but if stop to think about it,
tennis ball shoes, my dawg?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.779
That shit is dumb as hell!

18:34.447 --> 18:37.242
It's so hard.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.994
Raul, can I steal you
for a sec, buddy?

18:39.994 --> 18:43.289
<i>Oui,</i> chef. Just threw that
Memphis dry rub on the branzino.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.500
I think you're gonna
like it. What's up?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.919
A couple more things.
I was going over my calendar.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.420
Christmas in Tahoe is a go.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.922
It will be an honor
to read a psalm

18:50.922 --> 18:52.048
at your daughter's baptism.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.591
Thanks again for the invite.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.176
Oh, and, uh, one last thing.
You're fired.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.722
But I made you the godfather
to my children.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.307
- Uh...
- Oh, man.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.768
I don't know. I-I...
I-I thought we had something.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.103
No, and we do.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.604
It's nothing personal, Raul.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.356
It's-it's just business.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.983
Oh, shit. I can't believe it.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.734
Hey, bruh, it's okay. It's okay.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.736
Bruh, don't make that face.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.532
Bruh.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.950
I'm a fucking failure.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.036
Mm, I can't do this!

19:22.036 --> 19:23.621
I'm not ready for this kind
of responsibility,

19:23.621 --> 19:25.790
and I'm almost 14.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.460
Look, Raul, you've been
a line cook for 22 years,

19:29.460 --> 19:31.004
holding it down.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.547
You deserve to be head chef.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.632
The apron, the kitchen
is yours, king.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.634
- I'm out.
- You mean it?

19:36.634 --> 19:38.887
Oh, shoot, man.
I won't let you down, I promise.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.514
Oh, we still BFFs,
though, right?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.641
- Aye-aye, my dude.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

19:43.641 --> 19:46.185
Now hit me with some of that
brisket fettucine for the road

19:46.185 --> 19:48.146
'cause I'm hungry as fuck.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.569
How can I call myself a feminist

19:54.569 --> 19:57.655
if I don't have a strong group
of female friends?

19:57.655 --> 20:00.199
You, girls,
be my friends.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.580
Notes of caramel, floral aroma,

20:05.580 --> 20:07.040
intense full-bodied roast.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.377
That's 100% Sumatra!

20:17.967 --> 20:20.720
Yeah! Got you,
you little Dere-wolf!

20:20.720 --> 20:23.222
Oh, no. My big boy tent!

20:23.222 --> 20:25.391
- Yah!

20:30.188 --> 20:34.359
Seriously, everyone who worked
at Latrine was <i>off</i> Brian.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.027
That's where
the name comes from.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.487
It's not a compliment.

20:37.487 --> 20:38.655
It's 'cause
he's a fucking dingus!

20:38.655 --> 20:40.323
True dat, my G.

20:40.323 --> 20:45.078
But to accept the new new
is to relinquish the old old.

20:45.078 --> 20:48.998
Only you decide
where your allegiance lies.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.833
- Huh?

20:53.628 --> 20:56.673
You thinking about stepping
out of the line, bruh?

20:59.884 --> 21:01.636
Latrine is my lifeblood.

21:01.636 --> 21:04.389
If copping Latrine is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.230
Ha, ha. Yeah!

21:12.230 --> 21:14.107
- Oh, fuck.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.284
Good as new. Dope.

21:25.284 --> 21:29.080
I knew it! You'll always be
a loser, Benny!

21:29.080 --> 21:31.541
- You fucking traitor!
- Loser!

21:34.585 --> 21:37.547
Yeah. Yeah.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.507
Classic <i>Spider-Man 2</i> situation!

21:39.507 --> 21:41.009
No!

21:44.262 --> 21:47.015
Aah. Ah.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.313
Hey, Dale!

21:55.815 --> 21:58.234
Think fast!

21:58.234 --> 22:00.695
No!

22:00.695 --> 22:04.866
I'm vegan!

22:10.788 --> 22:13.249
Huh? What? What happened?

22:13.249 --> 22:17.086
That's why we have
the no-coffee list!

22:17.086 --> 22:22.800
Also, that'll be $22.50
for the turkey I just wasted.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.677
Hey, what's up? Oh, damn.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.220
What the fuck happened to you?

22:26.220 --> 22:28.639
Coffee moon.
Don't ask.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.684
- Off-Brian is
for corn-huskers!

22:31.684 --> 22:34.187
You hear me?
That shit is corny.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.521
Like a morning turd
after eating elote!

22:35.521 --> 22:36.898
- Come on.
- Come on, bro.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.441
Latrine till I die, bitches!

22:38.441 --> 22:40.818
- Let's go.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.739
Yeah, I am so not ready to be a
big boy, not even a little bit.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.949
Bro, fuck being a big boy!

22:46.949 --> 22:49.619
I ride so hard
for the little boy gang.

22:49.619 --> 22:52.038
And how are
my favorite night owls?

22:52.038 --> 22:54.332
- You guys look exhausted.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.209
Must have been some rager.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.669
Hey, D-Bone, uh,
I couldn't help but notice

22:58.669 --> 23:00.379
the big boy tent is missing.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.381
I know.
I broke the tent commandments.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.841
I'm so sorry, Dad.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.718
I wasn't ready
for the big boy tent.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.053
I'm not a big boy!

23:07.053 --> 23:09.263
I don't even want
to be a big boy anymore.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.141
But I do want you to ground me
for a year at least.

23:12.141 --> 23:16.395
How about instead, we agree that
the next time you go camping...

23:16.395 --> 23:19.065
- You can totally come.
- That's my D-bone.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.150
Now go get some Zs
with your gang gang.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.402
Thanks, Dad. You're the best.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.030
Little boy gang for life!

23:27.949 --> 23:29.742
When are you gonna
tell him the truth?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.369
When he's 40.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.997
<i>Hiroki Hassan is so last season.</i>

23:36.415 --> 23:38.167
<i>Hiroki Hassan is</i>

23:38.167 --> 23:41.087
<i>- so last season.</i>
- Just say the word, my liege,

23:41.087 --> 23:44.340
- and I'll destroy him.
<i>- Hiroki Hassan is</i>
<i>so last season.</i>

23:44.340 --> 23:46.425
Not yet, Tronté.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.428
- Our time will come.
<i>- Hiroki Hassan is</i>
<i>so last season.</i>

24:39.520 --> 24:41.480
Chirp.
