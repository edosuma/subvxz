00:19.140 --> 00:21.900
Hello! Hello, everybody!

00:25.180 --> 00:28.650
Yes, we're older, we're fatter,

00:28.700 --> 00:31.050
we're greyer, but we're back!

00:31.100 --> 00:32.640
We're back!

00:34.300 --> 00:39.410
And for the first time ever, we are
being broadcast, simultaneously,

00:39.460 --> 00:41.050
right around the world.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.530
So, bonjour, g'day,

00:43.580 --> 00:45.900
moshi moshi und wilkommen!

00:46.900 --> 00:49.610
And coming up now is a taste
of what you can expect

00:49.660 --> 00:53.620
over the next ten - yes, ten - weeks.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.250
Are you ready?

00:59.300 --> 01:00.500
Now!

01:01.620 --> 01:04.819
We are revolutionising
the world of cowboying.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.760
This is all perfectly normal.

01:10.740 --> 01:13.050
Do not let American Top Gear

01:13.100 --> 01:15.040
lap British Top Gear.

01:19.460 --> 01:20.800
Hammond!

01:22.740 --> 01:25.010
Coming to get you, Hammond.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.930
You need a new rear exhaust silencer.

01:39.660 --> 01:41.600
God's holy trousers!

01:43.900 --> 01:46.330
Calm, controlled, smooth.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.450
Good for the patient.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.700
Fuelled up. I'm amped
up. I'm pumped up.

01:53.820 --> 01:57.540
But it is... The Stig's
Australian cousin.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.860
Argh! Argh! Argh!

02:05.580 --> 02:08.820
May God have mercy.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.160
What in God's name is happening?!

02:20.940 --> 02:23.210
That all looks very exciting,

02:23.260 --> 02:26.250
but we start tonight with
our sensible hats on.

02:26.300 --> 02:30.610
You see, a few years ago, we
staged a race across London.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.970
We used a car, public transport,
bicycle and a speedboat,

02:35.020 --> 02:38.490
down the River Thames.
And it was one of our more

02:38.540 --> 02:43.290
~ genuinely interesting tests.
~ Yeah, it was, but it's always troubled us,

02:43.340 --> 02:46.210
because the bicycle,
ridden by me, won.

02:46.260 --> 02:49.650
And the car, which is the
whole point of this show,

02:49.700 --> 02:52.410
~ came home stone-dead last.
~ That's cos he was driving it.

02:52.460 --> 02:55.490
~ Well, yeah.
~ It wasn't entirely fair, was it?

02:55.540 --> 02:58.290
The car I had was a gigantic
Mercedes off-roader.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.570
It's not really suitable
for London traffic.

03:00.620 --> 03:04.490
Yes, whatever, OK? We decided
we would re-run the race,

03:04.540 --> 03:08.650
only this time, we'd use a car
that was a little more suitable

03:08.700 --> 03:10.170
for city centre work.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.810
Absolutely, the question now,
though, was, which city?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.330
Because we'd already
done London, obviously.

03:16.380 --> 03:19.690
So, Jeremy got a map and a
pin and because he's very tall

03:19.740 --> 03:23.570
and he has monkey's arms...

03:23.620 --> 03:26.210
THAT is where we ended up.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.650
This is St Petersburg,

03:41.700 --> 03:44.210
in Russia - the most northerly

03:44.260 --> 03:46.340
big city in the world.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.730
And this is the car I'll be using.

03:58.340 --> 04:01.090
This is the two-seat Renault Twizy.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.410
It costs just £7,000

04:03.460 --> 04:05.250
and it's an all-electric car,

04:05.300 --> 04:08.930
designed specifically for the narrow
streets of Europe's cities.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.970
With this, I can't really lose.

04:12.020 --> 04:15.170
Yes, he can, because
I shall be using this...

04:15.220 --> 04:18.089
It's the same sort of bicycle
that Chris Froome used

04:18.140 --> 04:20.540
in this year's Tour de France.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.200
Now, it is expensive.

04:25.780 --> 04:29.610
£9,000. It's £2,000
more than James's car.

04:29.660 --> 04:33.210
It's a lot for a bicycle, but it's
made of special carbon fibre,

04:33.260 --> 04:36.530
so it weighs just 860 grams.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.690
I love this thing.

04:38.740 --> 04:43.290
~ Every detail, it's just...
Look at that, it's magnificent.
~ Morning.

04:43.340 --> 04:45.250
~ Special.
~ Nice.
~ Yeah, I'd say.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.530
~ Bloody hell!
~ I know!

04:46.580 --> 04:48.580
~ That's amazing.
~ Yeah.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.930
Yeah. Not good for you,
I'm afraid, Hammond.

04:51.980 --> 04:53.610
I've got some medical research here.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.850
That racing saddle will put

04:56.900 --> 05:01.170
between 25% and 40% of your
body weight on your perineum,

05:01.220 --> 05:04.690
which is the bit of you between
your anus and your scrotum.

05:04.740 --> 05:07.730
And, as a result, blood oxygen
levels in surrounding areas

05:07.780 --> 05:09.650
~ will drop by 80%.
~ What are you saying?

05:09.700 --> 05:13.890
~ I just... Medical advice - cycling's
good for you. It's healthy...
~ Wrong!

05:13.940 --> 05:16.930
~ ..gets your lungs working, non-impact.
~ Totally wrong.

05:16.980 --> 05:20.570
~ Good for your cardiovascular system...
~ See.
~ .. bad for your chap.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.610
~ My what?
~ Your chap. Uh, honestly, listen to this.

05:23.660 --> 05:25.810
"Cyclists aged over 40 are considered

05:25.860 --> 05:29.370
"at greater risk of
erectile dysfunction."

05:29.420 --> 05:32.290
Yes, thank you, Dr Clarkson.
That's fascinating.

05:32.340 --> 05:33.530
What about The Stig?

05:33.580 --> 05:36.570
Oh, he's just on public
transport, as before, yeah.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.730
~ And you?
~ Well, now, you see, last
time, as you know, I used

05:39.780 --> 05:43.050
a speedboat to go across
London, but at the end,

05:43.100 --> 05:47.090
it couldn't go on land, so I had
to run, which cost me the race.

05:47.140 --> 05:49.290
This time, however,
I've chosen a boat

05:49.340 --> 05:51.140
that can.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.730
Hang on a minute, isn't
that a hover-van?

06:00.780 --> 06:05.330
~ It looks like a hover-van.
~ Well, it is.
~ Well, listen, gentlemen,

06:05.380 --> 06:07.650
most people laughed at our idea,

06:07.700 --> 06:11.450
when we went on the River Avon in
ours, but the Russians have taken

06:11.500 --> 06:16.410
~ our idea and put it into production!
~ It's a hover-van.
~ It's a hover-van!

06:20.140 --> 06:23.810
~ Are you feeling proud?
~ I... This is fantastic.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.930
Gull wing doors. We
didn't think of that.

06:25.980 --> 06:29.370
~ It's got a proper dashboard!
~ I know. It's from a Lada.

06:29.420 --> 06:33.330
~ It really does look like a van.
~ It is a van. It's got Lada engines,

06:33.380 --> 06:36.610
two of them, 72 horsepower, reliable.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.450
~ 72 horsepower?
~ Each.
~ 72?

06:39.500 --> 06:42.330
~ How do you operate it?
~ Yeah, what do those two pedals do?

06:42.380 --> 06:44.220
~ These?
~ Yeah.

06:45.740 --> 06:48.810
~ Pitch.
~ What pitch?
~ Of?
~ Propeller pitch.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.650
How do you steer it, with the wheel?

06:50.700 --> 06:53.740
~ Ah, no. Yes.
~ No, yes?

06:54.740 --> 06:56.490
When you're going quickly, this...

06:56.540 --> 06:59.890
~ As you can see, I'm turning
the rudders, yes?
~ Yeah.

06:59.940 --> 07:04.500
~ But that doesn't work at slow speed.
~ How do you steer it at slow speed?

07:05.820 --> 07:09.370
~ With pitch.
~ So, if you're trying to
turn tightly at low speed,

07:09.420 --> 07:11.890
~ when your rudders aren't very effective...
~ Yeah.

07:11.940 --> 07:15.940
.. do you use differential throttle
or differential pitch?

07:16.100 --> 07:19.610
~ (He doesn't know.)
~ Yes, I...
~ So, which do you do?
~ Both.

07:19.660 --> 07:22.050
~ Are there instructions?
~ Yeah, all in Russian.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.850
So, you're going to race
us in a hovercraft,

07:25.900 --> 07:28.850
with a fraction of the power,
anyway, of the one we built,

07:28.900 --> 07:30.730
plus, with controls
you don't understand,

07:30.780 --> 07:33.330
and the instructions are in
Russian which you don't speak.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.690
'With my confidence brimming,

07:35.740 --> 07:38.250
'it was time to prepare
for our important race.'

07:38.300 --> 07:42.820
If I'd come out and my bike had been
nicked, then, I'd have been furious.

07:45.140 --> 07:47.610
We'd start at the
Vostochny Yacht Club

07:47.660 --> 07:50.050
and, from there, we'd
race for 18 miles,

07:50.100 --> 07:52.250
all the way across St Petersburg,

07:52.300 --> 07:54.730
to the finish line on Yelagin Island,

07:54.780 --> 07:56.530
outside a palace called

07:56.580 --> 08:02.100
Yelagin... Ums-struss-struss-gids...

08:08.300 --> 08:10.250
That's all in Russian.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.420
That's all in Russian.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.100
Right, this is it. Goodbye,
Stig. Forward into glory.

08:31.260 --> 08:34.940
Here we go, defending the
honour of the car, sort of.

08:36.659 --> 08:39.620
I don't know what any of that means!

08:41.020 --> 08:42.169
Right, junction.

08:42.220 --> 08:46.340
I've got my feet clipped in the
pedals, I simply cannot stop.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.090
Stupid boy.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.810
Wrong gear.

08:59.220 --> 09:00.940
More power.

09:04.980 --> 09:06.180
Move!

09:08.500 --> 09:10.410
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.140
Oh, Christ!

09:17.260 --> 09:19.810
Oh, no. That's...

09:19.860 --> 09:21.850
a rock, a rock, a rock.

09:21.900 --> 09:26.740
Well, we're just going into those
reeds and this does nothing.

09:27.890 --> 09:28.890
Back!

09:28.940 --> 09:31.130
~ It's
~ BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP.

09:31.180 --> 09:35.220
Forwards, again, on that. This
is... I'm busy, I'm very busy.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.450
I think I saw a bump.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.570
Ow!

09:42.620 --> 09:45.720
That's probably ruined
my sausage a bit more.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.370
Bloomin' heck! Oh... da-da-da!

10:00.420 --> 10:01.530
Oh, God strewth!

10:01.580 --> 10:05.860
Now, it's just going round in
circles. Pitch, pitch, pitch.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.570
Right, now, I want to go that way.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.180
Christ on a bike! I'm
stuck in my own wake!

10:44.540 --> 10:46.130
'As my three opponents...'

10:46.180 --> 10:49.090
~ Come on!
~ 'Well, two of them,

10:49.140 --> 10:53.020
'settled into the race, I
was getting to know my car.'

10:54.900 --> 10:58.610
So, what is a Twizy, exactly?
Well, it's a metal cage,

10:58.660 --> 11:02.290
this frame, and there are plastic
panels hung all over it.

11:02.340 --> 11:06.370
There are two seats, one behind
the other, like a tandem.

11:06.420 --> 11:09.970
Underneath me is the battery pack.
That powers a 17-horsepower

11:10.020 --> 11:12.970
electric motor, driving
the rear wheels.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.690
'Acceleration?

11:14.740 --> 11:19.530
'Well, it can't actually go from
0-60, cos its top speed is 50.

11:19.580 --> 11:23.530
'But it does have a claimed
range of 60 miles.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.850
'And, as an extra treat...'

11:28.580 --> 11:31.930
.. scissor doors. Have you
got scissor doors, sir?

11:31.980 --> 11:33.380
No! Nyet!

11:35.140 --> 11:41.090
However, the Twizy is stone age
technology, compared to my bicycle.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.130
I actually have electronic
gears on this,

11:43.180 --> 11:47.170
so when I hit the button
on the handlebars,

11:47.220 --> 11:50.090
the derailleur, the thing at
the back that changes gear,

11:50.140 --> 11:54.050
moves across, with
a Robocop-like noise.

11:54.100 --> 11:58.210
'And to make the whole thing
as streamlined as possible,

11:58.260 --> 12:01.570
'it's been shaped in
Jaguar's wind tunnel.'

12:01.620 --> 12:04.890
It even directs the air
around the front forks

12:04.940 --> 12:08.170
and around the drinking bottle, so
it doesn't hit the rider's shins,

12:08.220 --> 12:12.690
which are very unaerodynamic.
Haha! There's May. Yes!

12:14.820 --> 12:18.050
Hammond, here's what
17 horsepower will do.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.410
Yee-hah!

12:19.460 --> 12:21.220
Oh, God.

12:24.540 --> 12:28.180
On board the only petrol-powered
vehicle in the race...

12:29.340 --> 12:35.730
.. I'd discovered the solution to my
problems, as ever, was more power.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.900
If you go quite quickly,
the steering works well.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now I'm
heading for the wall! No!

12:48.140 --> 12:51.610
I'm in a power slide!
I'm doing a skid!

12:51.660 --> 12:56.020
Out of the way, birds, I can't steer!

12:58.980 --> 13:01.530
Stig, meanwhile, had
finished with his tram

13:01.580 --> 13:04.580
and was now heading for
the underground station.

13:36.980 --> 13:40.260
We're back in front. It's going
to be like this all the way.

13:41.940 --> 13:46.690
'On the river, I finally had
HMS Awkward under control.'

13:46.740 --> 13:49.460
Come on, hover-van, catch the May!

13:52.460 --> 13:55.460
And there's another hover-van!
My, they're popular!

13:58.980 --> 14:02.690
22mph. Keeping a bit in reserve.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.610
Long way yet to go.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.730
Oh, really? Really?!

14:08.780 --> 14:11.180
Overtakes a bicycle, with ease.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.180
Get some speed on.

14:17.180 --> 14:20.970
Oh, hang on, I think that's
him. Oh, no, there he is.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.620
Come on, van!

14:24.580 --> 14:27.500
That, I believe, is James May.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.730
Where is Hammond? I don't
see... There he is!

14:31.780 --> 14:36.420
Richard Hammond is in sight
and he's behind me and slow!

14:37.460 --> 14:39.260
Ah.

14:42.420 --> 14:46.130
'Seconds later, I also took James.'

14:49.540 --> 14:51.370
Cocking Nora.

14:51.420 --> 14:55.180
Yes! Let's go win this race.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.700
By this stage, Stig had
found a metro station.

15:10.420 --> 15:13.610
And in this weird,
subterranean world,

15:13.660 --> 15:17.500
he was distracted by
many wondrous things.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.690
Can I take him in that gap?

15:25.740 --> 15:28.290
Making a lane... Yes!

15:28.340 --> 15:31.410
The interesting thing about the
Twizy is, it is a genuinely

15:31.460 --> 15:33.810
small car. It's a genuine city car.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.860
~ BLEEP
~ there's a tram.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.380
I hate trams. They're trains running
down the road. Trains can't stop.

15:42.660 --> 15:47.930
Whoa! Oh-oh-oh! Chuffin' tramlines.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.210
'Still, it could be worse...'

15:50.260 --> 15:53.970
Oh, no, don't want to go on the tram
tracks! I'm on the tram tracks!

15:54.020 --> 15:56.570
I don't want to... Argh! There's
one coming in the way!

15:56.620 --> 15:58.760
~ BLEEP.
~ Oh! Argh!
~ BLEEP.

16:02.490 --> 16:03.490
BLEEP.

16:03.540 --> 16:04.680
Ah.

16:09.780 --> 16:10.920
Oh.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.130
Argh!

16:16.180 --> 16:17.210
Oh.

16:17.260 --> 16:21.180
Oh. Ah.

16:26.180 --> 16:28.010
How's my bike?

16:28.060 --> 16:30.890
Yeah. Oh, that's not good.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.090
The derailleur's come off.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.370
It's sheared.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.730
Do you know what?

16:37.780 --> 16:40.780
I think St Petersburg
has beaten me already.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.170
'When the news reached my colleagues,

16:46.220 --> 16:48.620
'they were suitably saddened.'

16:49.900 --> 16:53.210
I mean, the one thing you
have to avoid, on a bicycle,

16:53.260 --> 16:55.860
in a city with trams, is tramlines.

16:57.060 --> 17:02.890
So, the fruit and nut-powered Richard
Hammond has not only ruined

17:02.940 --> 17:06.780
his testes, his penis and his
anus, but he's fallen off!

17:08.220 --> 17:12.700
This is a proper three-way
race to the finish now.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.490
James, hang on.

17:39.540 --> 17:43.730
James, how can you call this a car,

17:43.780 --> 17:46.010
when it's got no heater,

17:46.060 --> 17:50.090
the boot is the size of
a ladybird's clutch bag

17:50.140 --> 17:52.770
and the doors and windows
are optional extras?

17:52.820 --> 17:56.810
Yeah, but I like it cos it's simple.

17:56.860 --> 17:59.850
James, it can't even do 0-60.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.450
~ Yeah, but it's better than his hovercraft.
~ It is not!

18:02.500 --> 18:05.770
~ Well, it's less deadly.
~ Hovercraft isn't deadly.

18:05.820 --> 18:08.690
~ Yes, it is.
~ Listen, Hammond, two points...

18:08.740 --> 18:11.730
Number one, I'm the only person
in that race who is representing

18:11.780 --> 18:14.090
the Holy Trinity of
oil, coal and gas.

18:14.140 --> 18:16.410
~ The Holy Trinity?
~ Yes, Holy Trinity.

18:16.460 --> 18:21.170
And number two, every single city in
the world underuses its waterways.

18:21.220 --> 18:25.450
They've all got jammed-up roads,
congested trains, packed buses

18:25.500 --> 18:27.650
and, right in the middle,
a river with nothing on it,

18:27.700 --> 18:29.610
apart from a couple of ducks.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.090
That's because everyone's
terrified that there might be

18:32.140 --> 18:34.330
~ somebody on it in a hovercraft.
~ Well, yes,

18:34.380 --> 18:39.210
I agree waterways are underused, but
the hovercraft is not the answer.

18:39.260 --> 18:42.620
~ It is!
~ No, it isn't, so let's do the news.

18:44.460 --> 18:46.290
Um...

18:46.340 --> 18:50.130
~ How?
~ How can we do the news, when it's over there

18:50.180 --> 18:53.050
~ and we're, all three, over here?
~ See, normally,

18:53.100 --> 18:56.290
we say, "Let's do the news"
and, well, two of us do

18:56.340 --> 18:58.450
and one's over there. He
starts it and then we join.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.770
~ But if we're all here... No, we can't...
~ Um.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.250
I know. While we and the
cameras move over there,

19:06.300 --> 19:09.490
we'll show some footage
of a squirrel.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.660
Right, the news...

19:16.820 --> 19:21.130
Sh, sh, sh, sh. And first of
all, bad news, I'm afraid,

19:21.180 --> 19:23.970
because Britain's motorway network
is going to get a new type

19:24.020 --> 19:26.850
of speed camera, which
is grey and invisible.

19:26.900 --> 19:31.770
And unlike any other motorway speed
camera we've seen in the past,

19:31.820 --> 19:34.650
this doesn't just come on when the
limit is lowered for some reason,

19:34.700 --> 19:37.490
but it's on all the time, constantly.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.530
~ Really?
~ Yeah, constantly.

19:39.580 --> 19:42.290
That is funny, cos I seem to
remember the Tory Party saying

19:42.340 --> 19:44.570
they were going to "end
the war on the motorist."

19:44.620 --> 19:49.810
~ I remember that.
~ But you can end a war by
brutally killing everyone.

19:49.860 --> 19:53.490
Hertfordshire Police said, "It's
not in the public interest

19:53.540 --> 19:56.490
"to tell anyone where the cameras
are." So, fair enough,

19:56.540 --> 19:59.050
we'll pay the fine. "I paid
it into a bank account,

19:59.100 --> 20:02.210
~ "but I'm not going to tell you which one."
~ Work it out, yeah.

20:02.260 --> 20:05.530
I'll tell you the really bad
news is that they're already

20:05.580 --> 20:08.810
up and running in Kent,
by the way, these cameras.

20:08.860 --> 20:13.130
Steve Harley, out of Cockney Rebel,
has been busted by one of them.

20:13.180 --> 20:18.290
~ No!
~ Yes, he's 63 years old. He's
eking a meagre living out of,

20:18.340 --> 20:21.210
let's be honest, only one hit single.

20:21.260 --> 20:24.330
~ And now, they've nailed him.
~ How fast was he going?
~ 70.

20:24.380 --> 20:28.210
But somebody in a motorway control
room, in polyester trousers,

20:28.260 --> 20:31.650
with appallingly-smelly armpits,
had decided that the speed limit

20:31.700 --> 20:35.250
at that particular moment, for
no good reason, should be 40.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.250
~ 40?!
~ 40.
~ 40mph on a motorway?!

20:37.300 --> 20:40.410
Yes, that was the speed limit that
was prevailing when he was caught.

20:40.460 --> 20:43.490
~ How much did he get fined?
~ £1,000.
~ 1,000 quid, for that?!

20:43.540 --> 20:46.890
~ But I have an idea. You
know if you download a song?
~ Yeah.

20:46.940 --> 20:52.050
The artist gets 49p. Now,
why don't we download,

20:52.100 --> 20:54.650
~ (Come Up And See Me) Make Me Smile?
~ I love that song.

20:54.700 --> 20:59.090
Everybody loves that song. You can't
trust someone who doesn't like it.

20:59.140 --> 21:00.410
What are you doing, James?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.460
I've already got it, but I can
delete it and download it again.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.930
Imagine everybody did it!

21:06.980 --> 21:09.330
He'd wake up tomorrow and
realise, "I'm number one!

21:09.380 --> 21:12.290
~ "Where did that come from?!"
~ He wouldn't know, if he's not watching

21:12.340 --> 21:14.330
Top Gear. "Why am I number
one, all of a sudden?!"

21:14.380 --> 21:18.410
~ That would cheer him up.
~ And the great thing is if he does go

21:18.460 --> 21:21.010
to number one, he'll have enough
money to help other people

21:21.060 --> 21:24.250
out with their speeding fines.
We could call it the

21:24.300 --> 21:25.930
Make Me Smile Foundation.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.370
Oh, that's a beautiful idea!

21:28.420 --> 21:31.610
He could take out a small ad
in the papers. He could say,

21:31.660 --> 21:34.460
"Caught speeding?
Come up and see me."

21:35.500 --> 21:37.050
It could work. Beautiful idea.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.810
Now, Boris Johnson, who is a mayor,
has decided he wants to make London

21:41.860 --> 21:47.170
an ultra-low emission zone. That's
easy, just get rid of all the buses.

21:47.220 --> 21:52.650
~ And he's back on his high horse.
~ No, cos this time, I'm backed by fact.

21:52.700 --> 21:57.490
~ Are you, really?
~ Yes, I am, because the
levels of nitrogen dioxide

21:57.540 --> 22:00.970
pollution are measured
constantly in Oxford Street,

22:01.020 --> 22:03.930
right in the middle of London. I've
got the graph here from the week

22:03.980 --> 22:06.970
before last. You can see
here. 7th, this is the peak.

22:07.020 --> 22:10.610
Yes, that's the 7th of January.
8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th -

22:10.660 --> 22:12.860
the day of the bus strike.

22:14.460 --> 22:19.170
~ Yeah.
~ So, there you are. You want
to save the world, burn a bus.

22:21.020 --> 22:22.450
~ Let us move on.
~ Yes, let's.

22:22.500 --> 22:26.890
I think we should talk about the
cars that we're looking forward to

22:26.940 --> 22:28.650
~ this coming year.
~ Good idea.
~ Yes.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.570
~ Tell you what I'm looking forward
to this year, coming up?
~ What?

22:31.620 --> 22:35.890
Let's have a look at it. The Ariel
Nomad. Look at that. Come on!

22:35.940 --> 22:38.410
~ It's just scaffolding.
~ No, it is brilliant, is what it is.

22:38.460 --> 22:41.810
It's from Ariel, the same
people who made the Atom,

22:41.860 --> 22:45.610
~ the car that ripped his face off?
~ I remember it.
~ It grew back, sadly,

22:45.660 --> 22:48.410
but this thing is, kind of, an off-road
version of the same thing.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.970
It's got a 2.4 litre engine now and
it's got all those body panels there.

22:52.020 --> 22:54.690
They're made out of the same material
they use for traffic cones

22:54.740 --> 22:58.170
and boat fenders, so that
thing is indestructible.

22:58.220 --> 23:02.130
~ Which is a pity.
~ It's brilliant! I love it! Look at that!

23:02.180 --> 23:04.970
Yes, but what are you
going to do with it?

23:05.020 --> 23:07.890
Well, drive it about. You
can drive it on the road.

23:07.940 --> 23:11.210
~ That goes on the road.
~ Yeah, but you can drive
a tractor on the road

23:11.260 --> 23:14.130
~ or one of those massive cranes that do 8mph.
~ I like those, too.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.650
I want one. I'm going to
have one. It's brilliant.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.890
You are like a rural
simpleton, you know that?

23:19.940 --> 23:24.170
What do you mean, he's
LIKE a rural simpleton?

23:24.220 --> 23:26.250
The car I'm looking forward
to driving this year

23:26.300 --> 23:28.290
~ is a hybrid, actually.
~ Is it?
~ Da-da!

23:28.340 --> 23:31.210
There you go. Look at that.
That's the new Honda NSX.

23:31.260 --> 23:35.410
Been waiting years for this.
It's got three electric motors -

23:35.460 --> 23:38.450
one for each of the front wheels
and then one at the back,

23:38.500 --> 23:40.210
to supplement the twin-turbo V6 -

23:40.260 --> 23:45.090
550hp, weighs virtually nothing.
£100,000. But if you think about it,

23:45.140 --> 23:49.930
that's a tenth of the price of a
McLaren P1. That's just fabulous.

23:49.980 --> 23:52.370
~ I don't like it.
~ That's cos you're a rural simpleton.

23:52.420 --> 23:56.090
~ No, it doesn't look right.
~ It does look right!
~ Is it exciting enough?

23:56.140 --> 23:59.250
No, I do like it. I think it looks
great and sounds interesting,

23:59.300 --> 24:03.010
but I thought you would be more
interested in this, the new Ford GT.

24:03.060 --> 24:06.330
~ Oh, yeah.
~ That's more you.
~ Nah.
~ Why not? I'd have thought that was...

24:06.380 --> 24:09.330
No, I know. I've been
there and I've, sort of,

24:09.380 --> 24:11.050
done that, with Ford GTs.

24:11.100 --> 24:16.370
~ Yeah.
~ They'll fit it with a burglar
alarm that will go off every time

24:16.420 --> 24:19.770
you fall asleep or when your child's
doing some important solo work

24:19.820 --> 24:21.810
in the school production
- "Woo-woo-woo!"

24:21.860 --> 24:24.850
This is weirdly specific.
Stuff that happened to you.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.970
I know what will happen
and then you'll drive home

24:27.020 --> 24:30.490
and get a phone call from somebody,
saying, "Your car's been stolen."

24:30.540 --> 24:32.490
You'll say, "It hasn't,
I'm driving it."

24:32.540 --> 24:34.970
"We don't believe you. What's
your mother's maiden name?

24:35.020 --> 24:37.090
"Did she like boiled eggs
done for three minutes?"

24:37.140 --> 24:39.690
"I don't know." "We're going
to shut the engine down"

24:39.740 --> 24:41.450
and you're at the side of the road

24:41.500 --> 24:44.170
and get hypothermia and then
the alarm will go off again. No.

24:44.220 --> 24:47.570
And I'm, sort of, done now, as
you know, cos I'm mature and wise,

24:47.620 --> 24:52.170
with mid-engined cars. That does
look great, but just not for me.

24:52.220 --> 24:56.610
Now, that's nearly the end of the
news, but before we conclude,

24:56.660 --> 24:59.210
I need to say something, actually.
I'm sure a lot of you saw

24:59.260 --> 25:01.410
the Patagonia Special and I
want to admit, here and now,

25:01.460 --> 25:04.570
in front of everybody, I made
a terrible, terrible mistake.

25:04.620 --> 25:07.730
Nobody knows I'm going to do this
- not the producers, nobody -

25:07.780 --> 25:12.930
but I want to get it off my chest.
Right in the middle of the programme

25:12.980 --> 25:17.330
I said that the condor is the largest
flying bird in the world.

25:17.380 --> 25:20.010
It isn't. It's the
wandering albatross

25:20.060 --> 25:21.810
and I'm deeply, deeply sorry.

25:21.860 --> 25:25.660
Well done for getting that
off your chest. Feel better?

25:27.020 --> 25:30.490
No, if you make a mistake,
own up to it and move on!

25:30.540 --> 25:33.260
Fair enough. Right...

25:35.380 --> 25:39.410
.. now, we must move on to this,

25:39.460 --> 25:44.690
the Lamborghini Gallardo. It is
the company's best-selling car.

25:44.740 --> 25:48.370
In fact, of all the Lamborghinis
ever sold, over half of them

25:48.420 --> 25:51.210
have been Gallardos.

25:51.260 --> 25:56.580
Now, though, sadly, it's gone and
in its place, there is a new car.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.120
Here it is.

26:07.580 --> 26:12.580
It's called the Huracan, after
a famous Spanish fighting bull.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.540
It costs £187,000.

26:19.860 --> 26:22.900
And it's brand new,
from the ground up.

26:33.340 --> 26:35.210
Oh, well, that's a
problem right there.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.970
I could've sworn this
car was bright green,

26:38.020 --> 26:41.850
but according to the options
list, it's Verde Mantis.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.730
Other colours available include

26:43.780 --> 26:49.490
"Arancio Borealis, Grigio Nimbus
and Marrone Alcestis."

26:49.540 --> 26:53.770
How's a Premiership footballer
going to get his head around that?

26:53.820 --> 26:55.820
Anyway... to business.

27:11.420 --> 27:12.690
Oh-ho!

27:15.500 --> 27:19.220
Besides having to take over
the baton from the Gallardo...

27:20.340 --> 27:24.050
.. the Huracan also needs to hold
its own in a game of top trumps

27:24.100 --> 27:29.180
against the Ferrari 458
and the McLaren 650S.

27:35.780 --> 27:39.290
To do that, there are some
very big boxes to tick.

27:39.340 --> 27:43.620
0-60 needs to be around three
seconds... which it is.

27:45.460 --> 27:48.980
Top speed needs to be around
200mph... which it is.

27:50.540 --> 27:55.970
And horsepower needs to
be around the 600-mark,

27:56.020 --> 27:58.210
which it is.

27:58.260 --> 28:01.650
All of that is thanks to
a heavily-reworked version

28:01.700 --> 28:06.020
of the Gallardo's 5.2 litre V10.

28:08.740 --> 28:13.140
And as those revs climb, the
jackhammer choir really kicks in.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.770
The Huracan also has a
brand-new, state-of-the-art

28:22.820 --> 28:26.020
twin-clutch gearbox, which is superb.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.930
That's a good thing, because
the one in the Gallardo was...

28:30.980 --> 28:34.130
Well, it was crap. It was awful!

28:34.180 --> 28:36.450
This, though, this is a joy.

28:38.140 --> 28:41.340
And there's more hi-tech weaponry
at this car's disposal.

28:43.940 --> 28:46.610
It has carbon ceramic
brakes, as standard.

28:46.660 --> 28:49.570
The back end is sculpted
so it doesn't need

28:49.620 --> 28:53.090
a stuck-on rear spoiler
for downforce.

28:53.140 --> 28:57.260
And, like most Lambos, it has
a four-wheel drive system.

28:59.740 --> 29:02.680
But not just ANY
four-wheel drive system.

29:07.220 --> 29:11.690
It has three gyroscopes on board,
like you get on a fighter jet,

29:11.740 --> 29:14.820
and they're busy monitoring
everything that's going on.

29:18.660 --> 29:21.690
They send all that information
back to the four-wheel drive brain

29:21.740 --> 29:27.130
and it then decides how much power
to send to each individual wheel.

29:27.180 --> 29:30.180
My head hurts just thinking
about how all that works.

29:31.940 --> 29:35.700
The result is, you can corner
at sensational speeds.

29:38.580 --> 29:42.700
I'm glued down. The
grip is astonishing.

29:44.740 --> 29:47.180
It's almost undefeatable.

29:49.780 --> 29:54.900
If slithering about is your thing,
you can have fun in the Huracan...

30:00.020 --> 30:01.360
Ye gods!

30:04.060 --> 30:07.660
..but you need an enormous
pair of gentleman balloons...

30:11.060 --> 30:14.160
.. and your own personal
airfield to play on.

30:18.780 --> 30:22.500
And, for me, this is where
the problems begin.

30:26.860 --> 30:31.010
This Huracan has been designed,
on the road, to feel tame

30:31.060 --> 30:32.330
and user friendly.

30:32.380 --> 30:37.210
You don't get that special
Lamborghini mentalist feeling,

30:37.260 --> 30:39.890
unless you are here, with an entire
airfield under your wheels.

30:39.940 --> 30:43.040
And that's a bit of a
heartbreaker, actually.

30:44.100 --> 30:47.100
And while we're on it,
there's another issue.

30:49.460 --> 30:50.570
And it's a big thing.

30:50.620 --> 30:54.930
Basically - bear with me
on this - it's the looks.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.450
I know it's bright green and low
and there's a bull on the front,

30:58.500 --> 31:02.250
but I just don't think that
the Huracan is special enough

31:02.300 --> 31:03.730
for a Lamborghini.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.450
Lamborghinis should be jaw-dropping -

31:06.500 --> 31:08.970
that's why they make the
best bedroom wall posters -

31:09.020 --> 31:11.170
and I just don't see it with this.

31:11.220 --> 31:16.290
I think the problem is, this has been
designed to sell many, many times

31:16.340 --> 31:18.610
and to still look good
in ten years' time.

31:18.660 --> 31:23.220
And I think, for that reason,
they've played it safe.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.010
Lamborghini, like every car company,

31:28.060 --> 31:34.370
has got to shift units to survive,
but I think, with the Huracan,

31:34.420 --> 31:37.770
they have thrown the baby
out with the bath water.

31:37.820 --> 31:42.210
I've had some good times - no, great
times - in Lamborghinis, on Top Gear.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.930
And if the producers got my e-mail...

31:45.860 --> 31:49.260
.. there shall now follow
a montage showing that.

31:51.460 --> 31:52.940
Whoa!

31:54.660 --> 31:56.650
This is just so exciting!

31:56.700 --> 31:59.490
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

31:59.540 --> 32:02.300
That's absolutely brutal!

32:04.260 --> 32:06.050
Whaa-ha-ha!

32:06.100 --> 32:09.220
The most alive thing I've
ever driven. It's beautiful.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.970
Now, as a car, this
Huracan is probably

32:20.020 --> 32:23.370
better than all those
other Lamborghinis,

32:23.420 --> 32:26.220
but those cars are
better Lamborghinis.

32:28.860 --> 32:32.530
The other Lamborghinis made you
feel special, even in traffic.

32:32.580 --> 32:36.620
This doesn't. And that's a loss.

32:41.060 --> 32:46.610
What we have here is a Lamborghini
that I respect for its engineering,

32:46.660 --> 32:49.660
but love it? Quiver at
the very sight of it?

32:51.180 --> 32:52.850
I'm afraid not.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.020
This is annoying.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.850
~ This is really annoying.
~ Why?

33:13.900 --> 33:17.330
~ Because I completely
agree with you, for once.
~ Do you?!
~ Yeah.

33:17.380 --> 33:20.530
It's... Lamborghinis
should be mad and stupid

33:20.580 --> 33:23.610
and have rockets coming
out of their exhausts.

33:23.660 --> 33:26.650
And this, I don't know, it
just doesn't float my boat.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.090
I know, it's almost as though
they actually want to sell cars.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.810
And that is idiotic.

33:30.860 --> 33:34.130
No, no, seriously, because you know
James and I have always said that,

33:34.180 --> 33:35.970
~ one day, we'll open a pub?
~ Yes.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.650
And it'll be the best pub in
the world, specifically because

33:38.700 --> 33:40.250
we won't allow anyone in it.

33:40.300 --> 33:44.130
~ Not anyone?
~ No, nobody at all. Nobody.

33:44.180 --> 33:47.250
I know an accountant would say, "That's
a ridiculous business plan",

33:47.300 --> 33:50.050
but it will be good, because
it won't be cluttered up

33:50.100 --> 33:52.970
with people with smelly bottoms
wanting scampi in a basket.

33:53.020 --> 33:55.850
Yeah, but what's this got
to do with Lamborghini?

33:55.900 --> 33:59.530
Because Lamborghini should be making
cars that they want to make,

33:59.580 --> 34:02.050
not cars that their accountants
think will make a few quid.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.570
Yeah, I think maybe the problem
here is that Lamborghini

34:04.620 --> 34:05.810
is owned by Audi.

34:05.860 --> 34:08.489
And would you drink in
a pub owned by Audi?

34:08.540 --> 34:10.489
God, no. No!

34:10.540 --> 34:13.850
So, would you drive a car
designed by Weatherspoons?

34:13.900 --> 34:15.690
~ No.
~ No, I wouldn't do that, either.

34:15.739 --> 34:19.650
Anyway, we've got to find out how
fast this goes round our track.

34:19.699 --> 34:22.370
And that means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

34:22.420 --> 34:29.050
Some say that his favourite
football formation is 8-8-19.

34:29.100 --> 34:33.690
And while we were off air,
his iCloud was hacked

34:33.739 --> 34:36.530
and now everyone in the
world has seen his helmet.

34:36.580 --> 34:39.290
All we know is, he's called The Stig!

34:42.060 --> 34:45.449
And he's off. Tiny bit of wheel
spin and then the gyros

34:45.500 --> 34:49.170
and computers tell the four-wheel
drive stuff to do its thing!

34:49.219 --> 34:53.250
Flying through the first corner,
Stig really working hard

34:53.300 --> 34:55.840
at the wheel of Kermit's wash bag.

35:01.700 --> 35:06.250
Mmm, Stig enjoying a smooth serving
of The Carpenters, there.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.370
No dramas through Chicago.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.010
Now, Hammerhead.

35:10.060 --> 35:12.890
All-wheel drive cars
can push wide here.

35:12.940 --> 35:18.130
Stig using a very delicate
steer. No whiff of understeer.

35:18.180 --> 35:21.420
Just flying round there
and out the other side.

35:23.060 --> 35:25.810
♪ Sharing horizons that are new... ♪

35:25.860 --> 35:29.210
OK, Follow Through.
A chance to really get

35:29.260 --> 35:31.600
the ten-cylinder hammer down.

35:32.580 --> 35:33.690
Wow!

35:33.740 --> 35:37.170
Whatever Stig did during his holiday
has made him extra committed.

35:37.220 --> 35:41.650
Just two corners left. Turning
in, with precision.

35:41.700 --> 35:45.060
Ooh, he's gone a bit
sideways up to Gambon.

35:46.540 --> 35:49.540
Skates it through there
and across the line.

35:49.980 --> 35:56.210
This is amazing. This is truly
amazing, because it did it...

35:56.260 --> 36:01.090
It did it in 1.15.8,
which means it goes

36:01.140 --> 36:04.450
~ right the way up there. Look at it.
~ Wow.
~ It's quicker than the McLaren

36:04.500 --> 36:08.450
MP4-12C. It's quicker than its
big brother, the Aventador.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.530
(And that means everything we've
been saying is completely wrong.)

36:11.580 --> 36:13.610
Well, no, because I still think...

36:13.660 --> 36:16.570
That IS good, but it would
be better if it was slower,

36:16.620 --> 36:18.650
but had knives sticking
out of the wheels.

36:18.700 --> 36:22.210
No, you're right because this part
of the board is where Ferraris

36:22.260 --> 36:25.770
and serious stuff should live
and Lamborghinis should be here,

36:25.820 --> 36:28.610
~ which, interestingly enough,
is where the Gallardo is.
~ Yeah.

36:28.660 --> 36:33.170
Anyway, we must now put a star
in our reasonably-priced car.

36:33.220 --> 36:36.250
Now there are many, many well-known
Eds in the world these days.

36:36.300 --> 36:39.250
There's Harris, Miliband, Balls.

36:40.660 --> 36:45.450
There is. But... But my
guest tonight is the best

36:45.500 --> 36:48.970
and the newest Ed of them all.
Ladies and gentlemen - hmm-hmm -

36:49.020 --> 36:50.560
Ed Sheeran!

36:53.180 --> 36:55.650
Ooh, upcoming star, how are you?

36:58.460 --> 37:00.330
Ed Sheeran is here!

37:01.620 --> 37:03.260
He's here.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.480
Thank you so much for coming.

37:08.180 --> 37:11.410
Now, obviously, you're a
massive global megastar now,

37:11.460 --> 37:14.850
but is it true, what, five
years ago, you were busking

37:14.900 --> 37:17.730
~ on the London Underground?
~ No.

37:19.540 --> 37:20.970
No, I, eh...

37:21.020 --> 37:23.130
Did you ever sleep on
the London Underground?

37:23.180 --> 37:26.450
~ Yeah, well...
~ Ah, I knew there was something you'd done

37:26.500 --> 37:29.690
~ on the London Underground!
~ No, it was... Yeah, it was just...

37:29.740 --> 37:32.570
I would, if there wasn't a
place to stay, which, often,

37:32.620 --> 37:36.370
it was too late for me to call anyone
for a sofa, I would stay out till

37:36.420 --> 37:41.170
about 5am and then get on the Circle
Line and just, kind of, lean up,

37:41.220 --> 37:43.330
and then get up around 12 and....

37:43.380 --> 37:47.210
And just go round and round,
cos it is warm down there and...

37:47.260 --> 37:51.130
~ It's great. It's great.
~ There you go, there's a top tip.

37:51.180 --> 37:54.890
~ And did you sleep in the heating
duct at Buckingham Palace?
~ No, no.

37:54.940 --> 37:58.130
~ There's another no.
~ It was outside of Buckingham
Palace, not in it.

37:58.180 --> 38:00.730
This is what I find fascinating,
cos five years ago,

38:00.780 --> 38:03.010
you were trying to find somewhere
warm to sleep in London.

38:03.060 --> 38:08.210
People have really taken it
out of context. The Daily Mail

38:08.260 --> 38:11.700
~ have taken the quote and been...
~ No(!)

38:12.780 --> 38:16.690
No, I won't believe that the
Daily Mail makes stuff up(!)

38:16.740 --> 38:19.890
It wasn't, like, a massive
hardship or anything.

38:19.940 --> 38:24.290
I wasn't living anywhere in London.
I was sleeping on people's sofas

38:24.340 --> 38:28.730
and sometimes they didn't have sofas
to sleep on. It wasn't common,

38:28.780 --> 38:32.010
~ but it did happen, yeah.
~ Cos you were gigging a lot in those days,

38:32.060 --> 38:36.410
~ working your bottom off.
~ I haven't stopped yet. It's still...

38:36.460 --> 38:38.970
But you were travelling
down to Exeter, to get...

38:39.020 --> 38:43.490
~ How much for performing in Exeter?
~ That was the worst thing.

38:43.540 --> 38:46.330
It was an 80 quid train ticket
to Exeter and I was getting paid

38:46.380 --> 38:50.570
£50 for the gig and I arrived and
soundchecked with the sound engineer.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.610
He was like, "Doors are at seven."

38:52.660 --> 38:55.330
Got to seven, I was on
at 7.30. It was empty.

38:55.380 --> 38:58.050
He said, "Wait 15 minutes,
see if people turn up." Empty.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.170
15 minutes later, "Yeah,
wait another ten minutes."

39:01.220 --> 39:04.170
We ended up waiting an hour. No-one
turned up, so I just played to him.

39:04.220 --> 39:06.170
~ What did he say?
~ No, it was all right.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.410
And then I was, like, "Cool,
see you later, mate",

39:09.460 --> 39:12.650
got my £50 and went and I'd
missed the last train home.

39:12.700 --> 39:18.090
But I'd just bought, from eBay,
a Pokemon on the Game Boy Colour.

39:18.140 --> 39:22.170
And I just got that. So, I sat at the
train station, until the morning,

39:22.220 --> 39:24.810
until the next train, playing
Pokemon. It was great.

39:24.860 --> 39:26.770
It's where you learn it all from.

39:26.820 --> 39:29.730
So, now you've got to the
point from playing Pokemon

39:29.780 --> 39:34.210
on Exeter railway station, have
you not just sold out Wembley for,

39:34.260 --> 39:37.330
~ how many nights is it?
~ Three nights.
~ Just you? In front of a crowd

39:37.380 --> 39:41.130
~ of 80,000-90,000?
~ Around that, yeah.
~ Does that make you nervous?

39:41.180 --> 39:45.850
I was more nervous about today, doing
the lap. Genuinely, genuinely.

39:45.900 --> 39:49.650
Cos I mean your whole life is...
Obviously, you've met De Niro now.

39:49.700 --> 39:53.770
~ Clinton?
~ Yeah.
~ And then, today, you met James May.
~ Yeah.

39:53.820 --> 39:56.290
So, you've completed the circle.

39:56.340 --> 39:59.930
Can I talk a bit about your early
life, before we get on to the cars,

39:59.980 --> 40:02.930
if we may? Cos I was slightly
staggered. You had a number

40:02.980 --> 40:06.780
of illnesses when you were
little. (Not just your hair.)

40:07.540 --> 40:10.210
~ Glaucoma?
~ It probably could have led to that.

40:10.260 --> 40:12.930
I had a big birthmark
on the side of my face

40:12.980 --> 40:16.170
~ that I had to get lasered
off. And weird eyes.
~ Weird eyes.

40:16.220 --> 40:18.290
And you had to play
sports wearing some...

40:18.340 --> 40:21.370
Well, my view on it is that I was
a very weird kid in primary school

40:21.420 --> 40:23.330
and I probably didn't
have a lot of friends,

40:23.380 --> 40:25.810
but, I think, God looked down
and went, "You need some help"

40:25.860 --> 40:29.050
~ and gave me a guitar and it worked out.
~ And here you are.
~ Yes.

40:29.100 --> 40:32.570
~ Good old God.
~ The second half of my life is much more fun

40:32.620 --> 40:34.810
than the first half and
I'd rather that way round,

40:34.860 --> 40:37.370
because half of the popular
kids in school,

40:37.420 --> 40:39.730
I mean, you know, are...

40:41.380 --> 40:43.380
~ BLEEP
~ their lives up.

40:45.780 --> 40:48.490
Now, we'd better get on, I'm afraid,
to the elephant in the room.

40:48.540 --> 40:51.730
~ Yes.
~ Um... Ed can't drive.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.730
And I don't just mean you
have no driving licence.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.250
We've had that before,
with Johnny Vegas

40:58.300 --> 41:03.010
and Jack Whitehall, more recently.
But how much can't you drive?

41:03.060 --> 41:06.010
Or how much couldn't you drive
before you got here today?

41:06.060 --> 41:10.810
I'd never sat in the driver's seat
or put my hand on a steering wheel.

41:10.860 --> 41:14.570
The reason I said yes
to Top Gear is that

41:14.620 --> 41:18.290
I thought it would be funny,
the first time that I drive.

41:18.340 --> 41:23.450
It is... This must be the first-ever
televised driving lesson.

41:23.500 --> 41:28.610
I think so many 17-year-olds around
the world would want The Stig

41:28.660 --> 41:30.890
to teach them how to drive
and that's what happened.

41:30.940 --> 41:33.810
I think it is very, very
ballsy to come here, saying,

41:33.860 --> 41:36.130
"I don't mind being filmed
for my first ever lap."

41:36.180 --> 41:40.730
You have actually bought
cars for people -

41:40.780 --> 41:45.250
~ sound engineers and so on.
~ Yeah, I bought... Basically, every year

41:45.300 --> 41:49.170
I give people who work for me
a Christmas bonus and this guy

41:49.220 --> 41:53.690
who works for me was, basically,
every year, spending his Christmas

41:53.740 --> 41:56.330
bonus on things you should spend
your bonus on - his family.

41:56.380 --> 42:00.050
But he would always go on about
wanting a Porsche 911 Carrera.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.850
"Oh, that's my dream car, but
I'm doing up the bathroom next",

42:02.900 --> 42:06.410
~ so this year, I just got him the Porsche.
~ You bought him a 911?

42:06.460 --> 42:11.610
~ Yeah.
~ Didn't you buy another
sound engineer a Smart car?

42:11.660 --> 42:15.290
I bought my guitar tech a Smart
car, but that was another...

42:15.340 --> 42:19.450
What's he done wrong(?) How does
he feel going, "Oh, brilliant"?

42:19.500 --> 42:23.330
I see these people,
day in and day out,

42:23.380 --> 42:27.450
and they always talk about
the thing that they want most.

42:27.500 --> 42:32.370
He's got really low ambition.
We need to have a word with him.

42:32.420 --> 42:35.410
Are you sure he's doing your guitars
properly? Cos if he thinks

42:35.460 --> 42:37.810
a Smart's a good enough car,
when he could have said a 911!

42:37.860 --> 42:40.330
It's different strokes
for different folks.

42:40.380 --> 42:44.170
You're right. Now, moving on to
your lap. How was it out there?

42:44.220 --> 42:46.250
It was interesting.
It was interesting.

42:46.300 --> 42:50.090
I had some very funny bloopers, which
I'm sure you're going to show.

42:50.140 --> 42:52.180
We wouldn't do that.

42:53.700 --> 42:55.610
Yes, we would.

42:55.660 --> 43:01.330
Who'd like to see Ed's first-ever
driving lesson on television?

43:01.380 --> 43:02.370
Yes!

43:02.420 --> 43:05.050
We've got one or two clips
we'd like to show first

43:05.100 --> 43:08.380
of a few slip-ups. Let's
have a look at those.

43:10.660 --> 43:14.050
So this is... Whoa, that's
the second to last corner,

43:14.100 --> 43:16.810
~ but you missed that by a long way there.
~ That looks great.

43:16.860 --> 43:20.010
Oh, my God, is that the Follow...?
They go through the tyres!

43:20.060 --> 43:23.250
You're not going to hold it. You did!

43:23.300 --> 43:26.820
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Argh!

43:29.220 --> 43:33.500
Not again, not again at the
Follow Through? The same!

43:34.740 --> 43:38.090
What staggers me about that
is, when the car is sliding,

43:38.140 --> 43:41.010
particularly going through
there, which is about 80mph.

43:41.060 --> 43:44.130
So, it's sliding like that.
Most people just give up,

43:44.180 --> 43:47.690
but you, actually, were wrestling
with the controls in there.

43:47.740 --> 43:48.770
That wasn't planned.

43:48.820 --> 43:53.420
I just didn't know to take
my foot off the accelerator.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.730
You just kept it on?

43:56.780 --> 44:01.810
Yeah, I wasn't, like, "I'm going
sort this out and show everyone

44:01.860 --> 44:05.370
"that I'm really good at driving."
It was, literally, just like "Ah!"

44:05.420 --> 44:08.420
How do you actually walk
about when they're that big?

44:09.620 --> 44:12.730
Shall we have a look at the
fastest lap? Everybody ready?

44:12.780 --> 44:13.930
Yeah!

44:13.980 --> 44:16.740
Play the tape. Come on. Here we go.

44:19.380 --> 44:23.180
Yes, wheel spin from an automatic.
Oh, it is wet, isn't it? Yeah.

44:24.940 --> 44:26.280
Come on.

44:26.980 --> 44:30.850
It will and here it comes.
Down to the first corner

44:30.900 --> 44:34.370
and around it. Still can't believe
that you had never driven

44:34.420 --> 44:36.170
a car before this morning.

44:36.220 --> 44:40.410
And you're around at... Slightly
wide, but never mind.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.690
We're off towards Chicago now.

44:42.740 --> 44:45.860
Come on, come on, come
on, yeah. Yep, yep, yep.

44:47.060 --> 44:50.530
Like it. Neat and tidy through there.

44:50.580 --> 44:52.970
No real problems, at
all, and with tyre...

44:53.020 --> 44:55.360
Yes, the tyres are squealing.

44:56.820 --> 45:00.050
Keep your hands on the
wheel, that is important.

45:00.100 --> 45:04.730
And this is the Hammerhead, designed
to catch out the unwary and the new.

45:04.780 --> 45:06.130
But it hasn't got you!

45:06.180 --> 45:08.250
Right, now, this is it.

45:08.300 --> 45:10.730
This is coming up to what
we call the Follow Through,

45:10.780 --> 45:13.780
cos if you get it wrong
that's what happens.

45:17.620 --> 45:19.530
Lifting? No, you're not lifting.

45:19.580 --> 45:23.050
Nobody's ever had tyre squeal on
their first-ever driving lesson.

45:23.100 --> 45:26.850
Through the tyres, can he
do this? Yes, looking good.

45:26.900 --> 45:29.730
Oh, crikey, a little bit
of brake action there

45:29.780 --> 45:31.970
or that could be automatic,
on the car's part.

45:32.020 --> 45:34.250
Second to last corner,
catches most people out,

45:34.300 --> 45:35.570
but not you, not today.

45:35.620 --> 45:38.450
Into Gambon...

45:38.500 --> 45:40.610
And, oh, there was a
burst of acceleration.

45:40.660 --> 45:43.200
And there we are, across the line!

45:47.260 --> 45:53.610
~ Right, now...
~ It looked slower than it felt.
~ It does.

45:53.660 --> 45:57.610
It's not a fast car. There are faster
ones available on the market.

45:57.660 --> 45:59.770
Where do you think
you've come on our...?

45:59.820 --> 46:02.450
As long as I beat Jack
Whitehall, I'm happy.

46:02.500 --> 46:06.610
Two things... One - Jack had
driven a car before he got here,

46:06.660 --> 46:10.690
although he had no licence. And the
track was mildly moist for him,

46:10.740 --> 46:14.970
barely wet, but it was very wet for
you, so it obviously slows you down.

46:15.020 --> 46:17.410
So, he did a 1.54.5.

46:17.460 --> 46:22.050
And you, Ed Sheeran...

46:22.100 --> 46:24.410
you were...

46:24.460 --> 46:26.890
1.50...

46:26.940 --> 46:28.770
4...

46:28.820 --> 46:30.460
Ooh!

46:31.780 --> 46:33.650
..3.

46:33.700 --> 46:36.900
And in wet. You've done it!

46:39.140 --> 46:40.690
Yeah.

46:40.740 --> 46:43.490
That is... Are you genuinely
amazed by that? Cos I am.

46:43.540 --> 46:48.530
I guess so, but, like, that one
was the best time that I did it.

46:48.580 --> 46:52.650
And the times before that
were probably about 2.30.

46:52.700 --> 46:55.490
~ So, um...
~ Well, with that level of improvement,

46:55.540 --> 46:58.730
we should just give Ed
a driving licence now.

46:58.780 --> 47:01.650
~ Yes!
~ Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Sheeran!

47:11.620 --> 47:16.730
Now, tonight, we are staging
one of our important races,

47:16.780 --> 47:19.330
between the car, public
transport, a bicycle

47:19.380 --> 47:24.010
and Jeremy's rather fanciful belief
that we should travel everywhere

47:24.060 --> 47:25.090
on rivers.

47:25.140 --> 47:28.810
Yes, we are racing across
St Petersburg in Russia.

47:28.860 --> 47:31.330
And when we left the action,
Jeremy was in the lead,

47:31.380 --> 47:33.690
in his uncontrollable hovercraft.

47:33.740 --> 47:37.130
James was second, in his
tiny, electric Renault.

47:37.180 --> 47:39.810
The Stig was somewhere
or other on a metro train.

47:39.860 --> 47:43.900
And I had fallen off my
bicycle and broken it.

47:56.420 --> 47:58.220
OK, this is good.

47:59.580 --> 48:02.060
Flat out on water.

48:06.780 --> 48:09.810
Remaining range - it tells me
it is 40 miles, that's plenty.

48:09.860 --> 48:11.930
Bit of a jink round him.

48:12.170 --> 48:13.170
Ho-ho!

48:13.220 --> 48:16.930
You're probably thinking, "What's
the point of that tiny little car?

48:16.980 --> 48:18.730
"Look at the size of
that road he's on."

48:18.780 --> 48:21.370
Yes. But we're not in St
Petersburg proper, yet.

48:21.420 --> 48:25.530
We're still on the outskirts.
When we get near the middle,

48:25.580 --> 48:27.690
there's going to be a small alleyway,

48:27.740 --> 48:29.690
something built before
cars were invented.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.930
Things wide enough for a horse.

48:31.980 --> 48:34.980
And then, I shall sweep to victory.

48:57.380 --> 49:00.770
The Stig, James and Jeremy were
battling in what they thought

49:00.820 --> 49:03.570
was a three-horse race.

49:03.620 --> 49:06.250
But I had other plans...

49:06.300 --> 49:09.810
~ So, you speak English?
~ I do.
~ And you don't speak English?

49:09.860 --> 49:12.170
~ A little bit.
~ Can you interpret?

49:12.220 --> 49:15.380
I've broken my bike.
I fell off my bicycle.

49:16.900 --> 49:18.980
Can I borrow your bike?

49:19.940 --> 49:24.290
~ No.
~ Oh, please. I'm in a race.

49:24.340 --> 49:28.730
~ A hovercraft has gone past now.
~ I'm late, I have to go to my work.

49:28.780 --> 49:32.330
If we give you a lift to work,
can I borrow your bike?

49:35.180 --> 49:37.970
~ OK.
~ Really, can we?
~ Yes.

49:38.020 --> 49:40.180
Really? What a gentleman!

49:43.940 --> 49:48.290
As a producer took the
kind young man to work,

49:48.340 --> 49:50.570
I was getting to grips
with his wheels.

49:50.620 --> 49:55.050
OK, this isn't as fast as the
other bicycle, I'll be honest.

49:55.100 --> 49:59.620
I'm doing 16mph, instead
of 22, and it's killing me.

50:01.580 --> 50:05.290
Hammond would have struggled to
catch up with me on his £9,000

50:05.340 --> 50:09.410
Tour de France bike, but on some
clunky old piece of Russian pig-iron

50:09.460 --> 50:12.370
that he's borrowed from a local,
he's got no chance, has he?

50:12.420 --> 50:13.410
Let's be honest.

50:13.460 --> 50:17.410
On HMS Petrol, I wasn't worried
about Hammond's recovery

50:17.460 --> 50:19.780
because my lead was immense!

50:21.100 --> 50:24.610
And I was going like
a bat out of hell.

50:24.660 --> 50:25.940
Power.

50:27.380 --> 50:28.570
Right through the middle.

50:28.620 --> 50:31.420
But then, I hit the city centre.

50:37.540 --> 50:41.890
Got hydrofoils coming in at speed
from the left and the right.

50:41.940 --> 50:45.250
Two ferries and a water taxi.

50:45.300 --> 50:49.620
Oh, my giddy aunt, there's
one over there.

50:50.620 --> 50:52.090
~ Oh
~ BLEEP.

50:53.500 --> 50:56.530
In traffic like this, the
hover-van was a menace.

50:56.580 --> 51:01.180
Turn! Turn!

51:03.540 --> 51:06.210
Good God, I'm totally out of control.

51:09.500 --> 51:12.850
Holy mother of God, turn!

51:12.900 --> 51:15.090
Turn! Turn!

51:15.140 --> 51:16.280
No!

51:18.500 --> 51:20.570
~ Oh
~ BLEEP.
~ Not very...

51:21.500 --> 51:24.170
I'm crashing into St Petersburg now.

51:25.820 --> 51:28.020
Power! Come on, hover-van.

51:30.860 --> 51:35.980
Oh, there's swimmers. Oh,
please, turn. Please.

51:38.460 --> 51:41.370
I, too, had reached the city
centre, where the tiny Twizy

51:41.420 --> 51:45.220
would come into its own, in
the ancient narrow streets.

51:47.660 --> 51:49.060
Oh, cock.

51:50.780 --> 51:53.620
The main roads were
eight lanes wide...

51:55.180 --> 51:58.250
.. and the side roads
weren't much thinner.

51:58.300 --> 52:01.370
Small wonder there are no parking
regulations in St Petersburg.

52:01.420 --> 52:03.160
There's no need.

52:04.300 --> 52:08.290
Look at it. Could have done this
in a stretch Lincoln Continental

52:08.340 --> 52:10.480
or a Hummer or something.

52:12.380 --> 52:15.300
Worse, worse. Just worse.

52:20.260 --> 52:23.740
I will not give up,
I will not give up.

52:26.740 --> 52:29.210
22 miles an hour there. Oh.

52:29.260 --> 52:31.800
And I think I'm going to be sick.

52:32.700 --> 52:35.100
Meanwhile, back on the river...

52:35.940 --> 52:37.480
Holy Moley!

52:38.460 --> 52:39.650
And another one!

52:39.700 --> 52:43.130
'In order to avoid
death by hydrofoil,

52:43.180 --> 52:48.690
'I decided to leave the river
and use St Petersburg's canals.'

52:48.740 --> 52:51.450
This is a canal, it's what I need.

52:51.500 --> 52:55.940
They were much quieter, but
there was now another problem.

53:03.580 --> 53:05.420
No, don't...

53:07.820 --> 53:12.610
To get under the low bridges,
I had to deflate the skirts.

53:12.660 --> 53:16.890
That meant coming off the power
and coasting, which went well(!)

53:16.940 --> 53:19.410
Sinking. Sinking now.

53:19.460 --> 53:21.130
Oh, giddy aunt.

53:23.300 --> 53:26.130
Oh, Christ, this is lower,
this is even lower.

53:26.180 --> 53:27.370
Two and a half metres,

53:27.420 --> 53:31.660
that's pretty much the height
of the props on the back.

53:33.420 --> 53:35.570
No, no, no, don't rise
up, don't rise up!

53:35.620 --> 53:38.260
Oh, my... No, no, no.

53:41.060 --> 53:43.770
In the Twizy, I'd discovered that
no matter how wide the streets

53:43.820 --> 53:47.380
may be, a jam is still a jam.

53:48.500 --> 53:52.050
See, look, small cars don't
make any difference.

53:52.100 --> 53:54.530
If I was on the bike, I'd be
down there, but no car is narrow

53:54.580 --> 53:56.340
enough for that.

53:57.540 --> 54:02.500
While James sat motionless, I was
now entering the city centre...

54:05.060 --> 54:07.220
I can still do this. Oh.

54:08.700 --> 54:13.410
.. where I discovered that cyclists
are completely invisible.

54:13.460 --> 54:16.050
Oh, you're not... You
didn't... Honestly?!

54:16.100 --> 54:18.290
Not even an attempt, was there?

54:18.340 --> 54:21.700
Argh, wait for me, numb nuts.

54:26.340 --> 54:31.450
On the underground, Stig had noticed
that many of his fellow passengers

54:31.500 --> 54:34.090
were holding on to strange things.

54:34.140 --> 54:38.540
And so, at the next station, he
decided he should have one, too.

54:57.700 --> 55:00.090
I'm on the tram lines
and in a traffic jam.

55:00.140 --> 55:02.340
Come on, come on, come on.

55:04.540 --> 55:07.810
Terrified that I'll see Richard
Hammond turning up any second

55:07.860 --> 55:10.130
on his stolen mountain bike.

55:12.660 --> 55:16.330
Man stopped in the bus lane,
looking under his car,

55:16.380 --> 55:19.050
probably for a cyclist he's run over.

55:21.060 --> 55:23.610
Don't worry about me, I'm just
a cyclist. I'm just a pigeon.

55:23.660 --> 55:26.060
Don't you worry yourself, chum.

55:26.300 --> 55:28.770
Like all cyclists,
Hammond was becoming

55:28.820 --> 55:32.020
~ full of rage and aggression.
~ Come on, really?!

55:32.660 --> 55:37.130
Whereas, in my un-air-conditioned
hover-van, I was becoming hot,

55:37.180 --> 55:39.730
bothered and stuck.

55:39.780 --> 55:42.300
Sweating. Sweating a lot.

55:46.820 --> 55:50.210
Not certain this was a good
idea. I really am not.

55:50.260 --> 55:53.100
Oh, now, this one is tight.

55:55.500 --> 55:58.820
Lower. No, no, no, Christ.

56:01.460 --> 56:02.730
Bloody hell.

56:02.780 --> 56:05.530
Scary! No, no, no, no, no!

56:07.180 --> 56:12.450
Oh... Not now, not now, not
now! I'm in a big problem!

56:12.500 --> 56:13.820
What?

56:23.500 --> 56:26.500
~ Oh,
~ BLEEP,
~ I should have actually gone to the right.

56:27.580 --> 56:29.250
Right, U-turn.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.380
Concentrate, May.

56:36.260 --> 56:39.210
Thanks to James's famously-poor
sense of direction,

56:39.260 --> 56:41.490
I was now in with a shout,

56:41.540 --> 56:45.500
especially as I could take a short-cut
through the Winter Palace.

56:48.340 --> 56:49.530
Wow.

56:49.580 --> 56:53.020
Thank goodness James has got
a Twizy to fit in this place(!)

56:55.740 --> 56:58.530
Little corner cut, that'll
save me a minute or two.

56:58.580 --> 57:01.260
Water coming up, over the bridge.

57:06.940 --> 57:10.770
In the hover-van, I was
finally free of the canals

57:10.820 --> 57:14.050
and back on the now
traffic-free river.

57:14.100 --> 57:17.800
I've got a lot of time to
make up now. Come on! Power!

57:26.620 --> 57:31.250
We were now entering the
final stages of our race.

57:31.300 --> 57:33.010
And at this point,

57:33.060 --> 57:36.540
because all of us were all over the
place, any one of us could win it.

57:39.260 --> 57:42.360
Coming past. I can have
that, I'll have that.

57:44.980 --> 57:46.780
Whoa, heavy turn.

57:49.220 --> 57:50.760
Full thrust!

57:53.860 --> 57:57.260
I will not give up, I will
not give up. Come on!

58:00.620 --> 58:04.170
Really giving this thing
the electric berries here.

58:04.220 --> 58:06.060
Buffeting!

58:08.660 --> 58:12.300
That is 144 horsepower,
right there. Ha-ha!

58:17.300 --> 58:21.810
~ What the ~ BLEEP
~ hell, are you...? You great gangly
~ BLEEP ~ knuckle
~ BLEEP,

58:21.860 --> 58:24.530
~ greasy-haired ~ BLEEP
~ bag. ~ BLEEP
~ you.

58:25.620 --> 58:29.300
That's more like it.
A narrow side street.

58:36.020 --> 58:37.960
We can win this, van.

58:38.180 --> 58:39.530
Come on.

58:39.580 --> 58:41.930
Come on, come on.

58:41.980 --> 58:43.820
I'm very close.

58:44.860 --> 58:46.000
Ah.

58:48.660 --> 58:51.260
There it is. There's the end point.

58:52.780 --> 58:57.770
Where is this unpronounceable
palace? Where is James May?

58:57.820 --> 58:59.620
Where is The Stig?

59:08.620 --> 59:12.170
There it is. Yes, there
is the finish line!

59:12.220 --> 59:15.780
Oh, wait a minute, have I got to
get up that bloody thing? I have.

59:19.820 --> 59:23.180
Somewhere around here, I'm looking
for a big white palace.

59:25.940 --> 59:27.740
Right, here we go!

59:32.220 --> 59:34.290
No! No, no, no, no, no.

59:40.500 --> 59:41.900
Stopping.

59:44.820 --> 59:46.380
Oh, God!

59:48.100 --> 59:51.500
It's Hammond. Bloody hell. Ha-ha!

59:55.140 --> 59:58.050
Argh. Not again. Argh!

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.370
Please tell me, have I won?

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.370
Oh, Christ, look behind you.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.940
Oh, Jesus.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.330
Well, there we are. Proof
that the car is...

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.530
~ Is better.
~ It's better.
~ Was worth it.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.930
I'm afraid, even when
it's comedically small,

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.170
~ French and electric, it's still better.
~ I've ruined my penis

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.970
~ and £9,000-worth of bicycle.
~ Yep. I've just realised something.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.690
~ What?
~ Three of us are here.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.930
~ Yeah, I completely forgot.
~ Oh, hang on.
~ Where is The Stig?

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.520
Where is he?

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:00.570
James May has restored
the reputation of the car.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.930
~ Yes.
~ Thing is, though... The thing is, though,

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.450
if you don't want to drive
around in a little Philishave,

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.970
with optional doors, you'll
have to buy what came second,

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.010
which, of course, was the hovercraft.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.250
Oh, no, hang on a minute. I would
have won that by 20 minutes,

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.170
~ if I hadn't fallen off.
~ Yes, but you did fall off. Twice, in fact.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.820
~ Yeah.
~ In an 18-mile journey,
you consumed two bicycles.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:31.810
~ I did, yeah.
~ All we learned from you
is that you're a spanner

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.610
and it's difficult to draw
any meaningful conclusions

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.210
from The Stig's journey.
So, in that whole film,

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.890
we've learned absolutely
nothing, at all.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.770
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.690
Thank you so much for watching. See
you again next week. Good night!
