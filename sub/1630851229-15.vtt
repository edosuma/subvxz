00:01.818 --> 00:03.910
<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-Palliative care doctors will

00:04.063 --> 00:05.229
treat your symptoms

00:05.322 --> 00:06.672
and make sure
you live your best life.

00:06.823 --> 00:08.841
And this will give us
more time to do the things

00:09.068 --> 00:10.083
that we love together.

00:10.236 --> 00:12.753
I've been short-listed
for a seat

00:12.905 --> 00:13.920
at the state medical board.

00:14.073 --> 00:15.514
That's wonderful, Randolph.

00:15.741 --> 00:18.575
I want this baby to be 100% me.

00:18.744 --> 00:21.503
And since we're identical twins,
I was wondering,

00:21.597 --> 00:23.522
would you give me one
of your eggs?

00:23.749 --> 00:25.582
-Are you in trouble?
-No.

00:25.601 --> 00:28.009
I'm fully in control
of my past, present,

00:28.029 --> 00:30.195
and to some extent my future.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.680
First...

00:32.700 --> 00:35.776
we sterilize the tweezers.

00:35.928 --> 00:37.427
Don't burn yourself,
Mr. Soriano.

00:37.446 --> 00:40.614
ALBERT:
Ever inspired by
your confidence, Jordan.

00:40.766 --> 00:43.208
(laughter)

00:43.360 --> 00:46.937
Now we use our sterilized
tweezer to place four

00:47.030 --> 00:50.382
different antibiotics.

00:50.534 --> 00:52.125
Bingo.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.128
It'll take at least 24 hours
for us to see

00:55.281 --> 00:58.965
which antibiotics fights off
the bacteria.

00:59.118 --> 01:01.727
And that is just like
a real clinical trial.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.045
Progress is incremental.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.898
But that's the only way
for us to figure out

01:06.049 --> 01:08.383
which treatments work
to heal people.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.385
Like me.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.572
-So you're the petri dish?
-(laughter)

01:13.723 --> 01:15.482
-Ew. Gross.
-No, no,

01:15.634 --> 01:18.410
Jordan is right,
isn't he, Dr. Pravesh?

01:18.562 --> 01:22.581
Well, we have more
scientific terms for it,

01:22.732 --> 01:26.643
but, yeah, your teacher is
a straight-up petri dish.

01:26.662 --> 01:27.828
(laughter)

01:27.922 --> 01:30.589
But a very brave one.

01:30.666 --> 01:31.832
The risks are high,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.741
but just think of
the potential rewards.

01:33.836 --> 01:36.261
Scurvy, polio, diabetes.

01:36.413 --> 01:39.932
All of those are treatable,
even curable

01:40.083 --> 01:43.084
because of clinical trials.

01:43.178 --> 01:47.347
So today, class, please listen
to your sub,

01:47.441 --> 01:48.607
read chapter four

01:48.758 --> 01:52.444
while I will go to
Chastain Memorial Hospital

01:52.671 --> 01:55.188
so Dr. Pravesh can give me

01:55.341 --> 01:58.266
my first infusion
of a potentially

01:58.285 --> 02:01.620
life-saving drug
for my lung cancer.

02:01.847 --> 02:06.199
It could be a cure
or it could be something else.

02:06.352 --> 02:09.035
That is the beauty
of experimentation.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.297
We only know once
we've taken a chance.

02:15.194 --> 02:16.301
(monitor beeping rapidly)

02:16.453 --> 02:17.711
All right, let's chase
that last dose of epi

02:17.880 --> 02:19.171
with another amp of bicarb.

02:19.365 --> 02:22.123
Pushing bicarb now.

02:22.201 --> 02:23.642
How long have we been
coding him?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.218
30 minutes by my watch.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.663
But since EMS found him
at the scene,

02:27.797 --> 02:28.981
it's probably closer to an hour.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.649
He's been asystolic
the last three pulse checks,

02:30.800 --> 02:33.043
maxed out on meds.

02:33.061 --> 02:36.196
Fixed and dilated.

02:39.718 --> 02:43.162
All right, it's time.
Stop compressions.

02:49.228 --> 02:51.061
Time of death 9:34 a.m.

02:51.079 --> 02:53.505
(sustained flatline tone)

02:54.991 --> 02:56.733
HUNDLEY:
He's too young.

02:56.826 --> 02:58.159
IRVING:
And alone.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.737
EMS couldn't find a wallet
or phone on him.

03:00.906 --> 03:04.607
Olanzapine.

03:04.668 --> 03:05.575
Aripiprazole.

03:05.594 --> 03:08.836
Antipsychotics?
Unusual.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.171
Explains why the Narcan
didn't work.

03:10.265 --> 03:12.632
If you take enough of this,
you can still get high.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.360
These doses are...

03:17.423 --> 03:18.530
What?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.160
These doses are what?

03:27.933 --> 03:29.783
Then the unicorns have a party,

03:29.952 --> 03:31.376
but the kitty has disappeared.

03:31.528 --> 03:35.288
They have to save her, so they
call in Happy the bloodhound,

03:35.441 --> 03:38.275
'cause he has a great nose
and he's a famous detective.

03:38.277 --> 03:40.126
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't tell me any more,

03:40.279 --> 03:41.887
you'll ruin it for me.
Hi, Tisha.

03:42.038 --> 03:43.555
Can we read together, Daddy,

03:43.782 --> 03:46.299
-and you do all the funny voices
the way you do?
-(phone chimes)

03:46.452 --> 03:51.021
Yes, of course.
Right after work, okay?

03:53.717 --> 03:55.049
What is it, Daddy?

03:55.069 --> 03:56.568
Have a great day
at school, Bubble.

03:56.795 --> 03:59.129
(kisses)
Love you.

03:59.147 --> 04:02.074
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.503
♪ ♪

04:26.450 --> 04:28.008
Where you going?

04:28.160 --> 04:31.161
To the pharmacy that filled
these prescriptions.

04:31.179 --> 04:32.662
I've never heard
of this patient

04:32.681 --> 04:33.755
and I didn't prescribe these.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.089
That's not what you do.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.525
You have to go straight
to the FBI.

04:38.928 --> 04:41.187
Okay. And how do you know that?

04:41.340 --> 04:42.522
I just do.

04:42.674 --> 04:44.449
There's an office downtown.
I can give you a name.

04:44.601 --> 04:46.343
Oh, perfect.
You can give me the name

04:46.361 --> 04:47.786
of an FBI agent.
That's-that's great.

04:47.937 --> 04:49.346
His name is Todd Barker.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.014
I'll call him and let him know
that someone is using

04:51.107 --> 04:52.532
your name and NPI number
to prescribe drugs,

04:52.626 --> 04:55.185
-and he'll take it from there.
-Whoa, whoa, slow your roll.

04:55.278 --> 04:56.461
What?!

04:56.705 --> 05:00.357
-(pager beeping)
-Irving is paging me.
I got to go.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.341
Hold on.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.303
Hey.

05:04.454 --> 05:08.214
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:08.367 --> 05:09.791
(indistinct conversation)

05:09.885 --> 05:12.218
Dr. Hawkins told me
that Grace likes

05:12.313 --> 05:14.054
the comfy chairs
from the fourth floor,

05:14.206 --> 05:17.390
so I got you one.
And by "got" I mean stole.

05:17.543 --> 05:19.526
-Just don't tell.
-Thank you.

05:19.636 --> 05:21.878
Where is Dr. Hawkins,
by the way?

05:21.971 --> 05:23.304
He was with us
through all the chemo.

05:23.398 --> 05:26.383
Yeah, he'll still check in
on you, I promise.

05:26.401 --> 05:28.810
Dr. Pravesh is our doctor now.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.054
He's the clinical trial
specialist.

05:31.073 --> 05:33.056
So, it doesn't look like much,

05:33.075 --> 05:34.148
-but...
-My TILs.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.667
This is Albert's first dose

05:35.894 --> 05:37.318
of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.397
The cells that we harvested
last month from your lung biopsy

05:40.415 --> 05:43.175
are now primed to target
your specific cancer.

05:43.326 --> 05:46.236
-Pretty amazing, right?
-It's awesome.

05:46.254 --> 05:49.181
As in the true meaning
of the word, inspiring awe.

05:49.332 --> 05:51.533
Like the way I feel
about black holes

05:51.593 --> 05:52.909
and atomic vibration.

05:52.928 --> 05:54.669
You two are such nerds.

05:54.763 --> 05:56.246
Damn right.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.415
So you will get one dose
every few hours,

05:58.433 --> 05:59.749
six in total.

05:59.768 --> 06:02.936
It'll be some time before
we know if you respond.

06:03.088 --> 06:05.755
But this is the first step.

06:05.757 --> 06:08.075
Science never sounded so easy.

06:08.944 --> 06:10.518
So I want you to be realistic.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.596
This will likely make you
feel sicker

06:12.598 --> 06:13.446
before you get better.

06:13.599 --> 06:15.432
So expect flu-like symptoms,

06:15.525 --> 06:16.708
maybe worse.

06:16.935 --> 06:17.784
How much worse?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.619
Hey, don't worry.

06:19.771 --> 06:21.863
I could handle whatever comes.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.298
This is my lifeline.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.218
My last best chance.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.265
All right, then, here we go.

06:42.886 --> 06:44.144
Oh, Dr. Feldman, wait.

06:44.296 --> 06:45.645
Can you cover for me
for a few hours?

06:45.797 --> 06:47.964
No. My shift is over.
You're taking over for me

06:47.983 --> 06:49.149
so I can have a life
outside these walls.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.984
Yeah, totally.
So you can cover for me?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.078
-No.
-Thank you.

06:53.229 --> 06:54.804
I suppose I can't ask you
where you're going,

06:54.898 --> 06:56.973
but where are you going?

06:57.066 --> 06:58.475
12 hours on my feet,

06:58.568 --> 06:59.734
what's another 12 to 13?

06:59.828 --> 07:01.144
This is doctor abuse.

07:01.163 --> 07:03.571
Mariana, 36 years old,
respiratory distress.

07:03.665 --> 07:05.239
-(Mariana inhales raggedly)
-No breath sounds on the right.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.983
Likely a collapsed lung.
Where do you want us?

07:07.076 --> 07:08.743
Bay 11.
Do you have a set of vitals?

07:08.762 --> 07:11.988
Heart rate 120. BP 80/palp.
90%, 92% on oxygen.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.247
All right. Page Dr. Austin.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.750
Dr. Austin
is on his way out of here,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.160
but feel free to page Dr. Devi.

07:17.179 --> 07:19.212
-You're leaving, too? Unfair.
-Yes, sir.

07:19.364 --> 07:20.664
If I have to stay,
everyone else should stay!

07:20.666 --> 07:23.166
-I'm here. You leaving?
-I have to visit my mother.

07:23.259 --> 07:25.426
And Irving is whining
like a puppy dog in pain.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.353
-You go. I got this.
-IRVING: On my count.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.115
-One, two, three.
-What do you need?

07:30.342 --> 07:31.841
How do you feel
about a pneumothorax?

07:31.860 --> 07:33.860
-Psyched.
-IRVING: This is Mariana.

07:34.029 --> 07:35.937
You live in my ER now, Devi.

07:36.531 --> 07:38.682
Mariana, we're first gonna take
a listen to your lungs,

07:38.700 --> 07:41.293
okay? Hundley, can I get
a chest tube kit, please?

07:41.369 --> 07:42.377
Mm-hmm.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.949
Your right lung has collapsed.
I need to do a decompression

07:47.968 --> 07:50.260
to help you breathe better,
okay?

07:52.698 --> 07:54.181
(grunts)

08:02.057 --> 08:04.316
We're gonna numb you first.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.121
This may hurt a bit.

08:19.983 --> 08:21.500
(Mariana whimpering)

08:25.488 --> 08:26.896
Chest tube to me.

08:26.915 --> 08:29.132
Mm-hmm.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.751
Take a deep breath in.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.902
(Mariana inhales)

08:32.921 --> 08:35.096
(crying out)

08:36.666 --> 08:39.017
-(Mariana gasping, whimpering)
-All right, we're in place.

08:39.168 --> 08:40.910
Pleur-evac.

08:40.929 --> 08:42.503
(suctioning)

08:42.597 --> 08:43.930
(beeping steadily)

08:44.082 --> 08:46.399
(breathing deeply)

08:49.679 --> 08:52.438
I felt like I was about to die.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.681
Well, you were, dear.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.867
But Dr. Devi just saved you

08:56.094 --> 08:57.536
like the boss she is.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.290
Thank you.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.936
Here we go, milady.
Back to its rightful owner.

09:06.955 --> 09:08.713
You were only CEO
for a few days.

09:08.865 --> 09:09.956
Wait, did you move my plant?

09:10.108 --> 09:11.107
Yeah,
it has better light over there.

09:11.126 --> 09:12.442
I have my first meeting

09:12.460 --> 09:14.944
as a member of the state
medical board today,

09:14.946 --> 09:18.281
so I can start a chapter
in my new life

09:18.300 --> 09:21.968
and I can hand you
a smoothly running hospital.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.728
Huh.
Looks like Trevor Daniels

09:23.880 --> 09:26.306
-didn't show up
for work again today.
-He's been

09:26.458 --> 09:27.899
AWOL since speaking out
on Billie's behalf.

09:28.051 --> 09:29.425
She's trying to find him.

09:29.628 --> 09:33.721
And Dr. Hawkins called to say
he's on his way to the FBI.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.906
The FBI?

09:35.058 --> 09:37.224
Oh. And our new ER doc

09:37.302 --> 09:39.060
just took off
in the middle of her shift.

09:39.154 --> 09:42.080
What were you saying about
a smoothly running hospital?

09:42.307 --> 09:44.749
That in your capable hands,
it'll soon be silk.

09:44.901 --> 09:48.378
-You look very sharp
in that suit, by the way.
-I know.

09:52.651 --> 09:55.151
Okay, um, your own sister

09:55.170 --> 09:57.596
being the biological mother

09:57.823 --> 09:59.264
of your child is...

09:59.433 --> 10:01.674
It's a little weird, right?
Am I allowed to say that?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.935
Lots of women donate their eggs
to their sisters.

10:04.162 --> 10:07.606
True, but Devon has a point.
Giving you

10:07.757 --> 10:08.848
one of my eggs is complicated.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.424
We have to be honest
about this, right?

10:10.518 --> 10:12.944
You both would be
the baby's mother, technically.

10:13.096 --> 10:15.355
No.<i> I'd</i> be the baby's mother.

10:15.507 --> 10:17.674
I will give birth
and raise my child.

10:17.767 --> 10:21.268
Leela's responsibility ends
with the donation of the egg.

10:21.363 --> 10:24.956
Yes, but you are identical twins
with identical DNA.

10:25.108 --> 10:27.867
If I could have a child
with my own egg

10:28.019 --> 10:29.686
that's identical to hers,

-But who will be the father?

10:33.692 --> 10:35.050
A sperm donor.

10:35.785 --> 10:37.377
Okay, but who?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.362
That's my call.

10:40.198 --> 10:42.432
Just give me some time
to think about it.

I know I don't really
have a say here,

-No, you don't, sweets.

Ah.

I know that smell.

That brings me back

11:59.202 --> 12:01.277
to sixth grade, after school,

12:01.296 --> 12:03.871
racing home
so I could get my hands

12:03.965 --> 12:08.059
on double banana nut muffins.
Yes.

Well, my store-bought scones are
ashamed to be in your presence.

Nonsense. We need something
to feed the birds.

Honestly, Mom, when was

so what can I do for you,
baby boy?

12:44.839 --> 12:46.839
Nothing.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.009
Just seeing you like this

It's just, um, some chills.

He's complaining of nausea
and muscle aches, as well.

13:29.884 --> 13:31.701
Yeah,
it's just like the flu, right?

13:31.870 --> 13:34.537
Okay, you're spiking a fever.
I'll order you some meds

13:34.630 --> 13:37.056

I'll put him on oxygen.

This isn't like the flu.

It's getting harder really fast,

These are all brand-name drugs.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.266
Highly reimbursed medications.

Medicare fraud.

Yes. Kickbacks. Drug diversion.

14:41.122 --> 14:42.380
We think it's a pill mill.

14:42.531 --> 14:44.716
A big one.
At least six clinics involved.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.776
Probably busing people in.

even doctors who assist

15:05.964 --> 15:07.088

-Dr. Hawkins' name and numbers?
-BARKER: Few years ago,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.234
there was a ransomware attack
on Chastain.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.920
They were just idiots
in some basement.

15:22.147 --> 15:24.255
Yeah, well,
typically these idiots

15:24.407 --> 15:27.425
sell your identities,
DEA, NPI numbers

15:27.576 --> 15:29.743
to larger
criminal organizations.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.096
So, what do I do about it?

15:32.248 --> 15:35.416
You go back to Chastain,
leave this to us.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.844
If you don't,
it could be your life in danger.

15:38.997 --> 15:41.272
I think we've heard enough
to understand.

15:41.499 --> 15:42.498
Not nearly.

15:42.517 --> 15:44.016
That's all I can tell you
right now.

15:44.169 --> 15:45.759
CADE:
And we have to get back to work.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.404
Great seeing you again.
Talk soon.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.264
Dr. Hawkins.

15:50.358 --> 15:53.743
You and I need
to have a little chat.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.774
Mariana, how are you feeling?

16:00.868 --> 16:02.609
Better. Very well, actually.

16:02.704 --> 16:03.795
Oh, glad to hear it.

16:04.022 --> 16:05.705
I can't believe
this happened again.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.707
Wait,
your lung's collapsed before?

16:07.801 --> 16:10.042
Yes.
My doctor wasn't too worried.

16:10.195 --> 16:12.028
He said I was young, healthy.

16:12.046 --> 16:14.788
Is it possible
this is just a coincidence?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.307
It's unlikely.

16:16.459 --> 16:18.643
We're going to have to keep you
here to figure this out.

16:18.870 --> 16:21.554
-No, I have an important meeting
with a client later.
-Cancel it.

16:21.706 --> 16:23.272
Can you elaborate?

16:24.042 --> 16:25.725
I'm sorry.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.819
I did not mean
to sound so blunt.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.470
I'm a surgeon,

16:29.489 --> 16:31.972
so most of the patients
I deal with are unconscious.

16:32.066 --> 16:33.899
My bedside manner
gets a little rusty.

16:34.052 --> 16:35.718
But that's no excuse.

16:35.811 --> 16:38.145
I'd be more concerned
if your scalpel was rusty.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.814
And you do not need
to apologize.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.409
Would a male surgeon apologize?

16:43.561 --> 16:45.152
It's unlikely.

16:45.246 --> 16:47.672
I've told my team to shoot me

16:47.899 --> 16:49.749
if I ever apologize to a client.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.658
Makes them trust you less.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.569
What do you do?

16:53.588 --> 16:54.754
I'm an architect.

16:54.906 --> 16:56.848
My uncle's an architect.

16:57.075 --> 16:59.075
He's never apologized
for anything.

16:59.168 --> 17:02.520
Frank Lloyd Wright said,
"Early in life, I had to choose

17:02.671 --> 17:06.582
"between honest arrogance
and hypocritical humility.

17:06.601 --> 17:07.859
I chose honest arrogance."

17:08.086 --> 17:09.810
(chuckles)
Well,

17:09.863 --> 17:13.156
I vote for honest humility.

17:13.867 --> 17:14.940
And on that note,

17:15.035 --> 17:17.184
your lung should not
collapse twice.

17:17.278 --> 17:19.779
We'll have to consult
a specialist, okay?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.249
I'll be back to check
on you later.

17:24.860 --> 17:27.119
(inhales, exhales)

17:27.213 --> 17:30.864
-Breathing better?
-Mm-hmm.

17:31.033 --> 17:35.111
See? Everything's fine.

17:35.129 --> 17:37.613
If he's this bad
after a first dose,

17:37.706 --> 17:38.781
what will happen next?

17:38.800 --> 17:40.749
He's got five more to go.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.895
Everybody reacts differently.

17:44.046 --> 17:45.788
We won't know until we proceed.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.356
That's just how it works.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.293
Grace, you haven't eaten
all day.

17:50.386 --> 17:53.887
Why don't you go
to the cafeteria for a bit?

17:53.907 --> 17:55.889
I'll be fine.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.534
(sighs)
Okay.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.747
(receding footsteps)

18:04.642 --> 18:08.086
I've tried to talk her through
this, explain the science.

18:08.237 --> 18:10.421
I gave her a book
on Marie Curie.

18:10.573 --> 18:14.092
Big mistake, since Curie
died experimenting on herself.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.743
Yeah, still walking
that one back.

18:16.912 --> 18:18.346
(both chuckle)

18:20.082 --> 18:22.266
Albert, it's time
for your second dose.

18:22.493 --> 18:24.009
I figured.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.479
That's why I asked her
to step out.

18:29.425 --> 18:30.499
You sure?

18:30.518 --> 18:32.360
Yes.

18:33.762 --> 18:35.196
I'll be back.

18:40.862 --> 18:42.027
(exhales)

18:42.180 --> 18:46.040
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want...

18:50.688 --> 18:53.189
Well, I don't think we've seen
anything too concerning today.

18:53.282 --> 18:54.707
Certainly nothing
requiring punitive action.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.192
BELL:
Uh, actually, there is one case

18:56.210 --> 18:58.194
we haven't discussed
that's alarming.

18:58.212 --> 18:59.953
Emily Benesch, 32 years old.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.808
Ms. Benesch had, uh, an anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion.

19:03.959 --> 19:04.809
Dr. Elkins,
you're a neurosurgeon.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.977
Did you see this complaint?

19:06.128 --> 19:07.294
I did. As I recall,

19:07.388 --> 19:09.038
the patient had
complications post-op.

19:09.131 --> 19:10.982
The surgeon damaged
her spinal cord.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.966
Now Ms. Benesch is a paraplegic.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.968
Spinal surgery always has risks.

19:15.062 --> 19:16.320
Well, uh,

19:16.472 --> 19:19.565
after the operation,
she felt something was wrong,

19:19.717 --> 19:23.661
she asked her surgeon Dr. Keith
Bosley for a follow-up,

19:23.888 --> 19:26.238
and he "brushed her off."

19:26.391 --> 19:29.667
I know Dr. Bosley personally.
I-I doubt he brushed her off.

19:29.894 --> 19:31.744
Well, I found several
other complaints against him.

19:31.896 --> 19:34.730
So wouldn't, uh,
multiple complaints

19:34.749 --> 19:36.299
be a red flag?

19:37.919 --> 19:42.905
I think we should dig into
Dr. Bosley's patient outcomes

19:42.998 --> 19:47.268
and... give Ms. Benesch
a fair hearing.

19:52.767 --> 19:55.918
ABERNATHY:
Stories like this
flood our office.

19:56.011 --> 19:58.738
Patients get emotional
when complications occur

19:58.847 --> 20:00.514
and look to place blame.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.442
This patient isn't emotional,
she's a paraplegic.

20:03.594 --> 20:05.852
We can't fix
every patient's problem

20:05.947 --> 20:07.872
or guarantee everyone
a perfect outcome.

20:08.023 --> 20:09.782
No, I understand that.

20:09.934 --> 20:13.360
But isn't it the job
of this board

20:13.379 --> 20:15.213
to hear our patients' problems,

20:15.289 --> 20:19.124
particularly when there are
repeat complaints?

20:19.219 --> 20:20.793
Dr. Elkins, will you delve
into this more deeply?

20:20.945 --> 20:22.278
BELL:
Should a close friend

20:22.296 --> 20:26.224
of Dr. Bosley's be the one
to lead his investigation?

20:26.451 --> 20:29.876
State medical boards
are staffed by doctors

20:29.971 --> 20:32.230
precisely because we are
the best people

20:32.398 --> 20:34.123
to judge our own colleagues.

20:34.141 --> 20:37.068
So let's just simmer down.

20:37.295 --> 20:40.220
Just watch,
and learn how we operate.

20:40.389 --> 20:41.797
Oh, I-I think I'm getting
a pretty good sense

20:41.890 --> 20:43.324
of how you operate.

20:56.497 --> 20:58.572
CONRAD:
When you wouldn't answer
questions about your past,

20:58.666 --> 21:00.907
I didn't push.

21:00.927 --> 21:06.347
I respected your privacy,
but that's off the table now.

21:09.418 --> 21:11.143
Talk to me.

21:16.501 --> 21:20.336
It started with a phone call
back when I was a resident.

21:20.429 --> 21:23.764
I was employed by a big
hospital system in Chicago

21:23.858 --> 21:25.508
that took a lot
of Medicare patients.

21:25.526 --> 21:29.862
They were overtreating,
doing unnecessary surgeries,

21:29.956 --> 21:32.364
and ripping off Medicare
for millions of dollars.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.775
That's almost standard
operational procedure

21:34.794 --> 21:36.852
in some hospitals these days.

21:36.945 --> 21:39.522
I couldn't let it stand.

21:39.540 --> 21:43.784
I see a problem...
I try to fix it.

21:43.878 --> 21:45.970
I get that.

21:48.883 --> 21:50.957
So I called a Medicare
fraud tip line,

21:51.035 --> 21:54.127
and the DOJ got involved.

21:54.221 --> 21:56.221
Long story short,
I ended up wearing a wire

21:56.390 --> 21:59.875
and collecting documents to help
them get the proof they needed.

21:59.968 --> 22:01.402
You were hooked.

22:02.638 --> 22:04.396
Yeah.

22:04.549 --> 22:08.326
So when the FBI approached me
to keep working with them...

22:09.329 --> 22:10.886
...I was all in.

22:10.905 --> 22:12.330
They need doctors
to understand medically

22:12.481 --> 22:16.167
what's fraud and what isn't,
and to work undercover.

22:16.318 --> 22:20.729
Soon, we went after
the biggest fish.

22:20.898 --> 22:22.414
The Mafia.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.400
(exhales)

22:24.418 --> 22:27.511
It was a much tougher world.
Lot of risk.

22:27.663 --> 22:33.392
Eventually, I was identified
as an FBI operative, and...

22:35.170 --> 22:37.413
...there was an attempt
on my life.

22:37.431 --> 22:40.099
-Are you safe now?
-It's been two years.

22:40.267 --> 22:44.028
But the Mafia makes a practice
of punishing its enemies.

22:44.255 --> 22:47.940
I never know who I can trust,

22:48.092 --> 22:51.184
so I say as little as possible
about my past,

22:51.204 --> 22:54.997
and I don't stay long
in one place.

22:55.933 --> 22:57.750
You should have told me.

23:03.232 --> 23:06.258
I get that
you're in a tough spot.

23:09.964 --> 23:12.223
Here's the thing.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.452
I like you.

23:16.545 --> 23:18.729
And I like you.

23:20.124 --> 23:22.124
But it ends there.

23:22.217 --> 23:24.977
I don't get involved
with anyone, Conrad.

23:25.129 --> 23:27.630
And no one should
get involved with me,

23:27.690 --> 23:28.964
for a number of reasons,

23:28.983 --> 23:34.319
but the main one
is that I will disappear.

23:35.230 --> 23:38.157
Well, maybe you should
stop running.

23:38.309 --> 23:41.419
Trust me on this.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.648
You take care of people.

23:45.666 --> 23:48.575
You want to take care of me.

23:48.669 --> 23:49.927
But you can't.

23:50.078 --> 23:53.139
I take care of myself.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.978
I'll see you at Chastain.

24:09.690 --> 24:12.366
(phone chimes)

24:16.514 --> 24:19.290
-(monitor beeping rapidly)
-Dr. Pravesh, what's going on?

24:19.441 --> 24:21.608
His pressure is plummeting
and he's spiking a fever again.

24:21.702 --> 24:22.868
He still has three doses left.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.536
More fluids should
bring up the pressure.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.855
I-I don't think
he can handle the trial.

24:26.874 --> 24:28.132
I don't think I can, either.

24:28.283 --> 24:30.042
-I want it to stop.
-When Albert is stable,

24:30.118 --> 24:31.618
we will discuss it,
but right now

24:31.637 --> 24:33.378
we don't even know
if the trial is to blame.

24:33.531 --> 24:35.956
It could be an infection,
and I don't want to deprive him

24:35.975 --> 24:38.033
of a cure for the wrong reasons.

24:38.126 --> 24:39.626
How are you gonna figure it out?

24:39.645 --> 24:41.127
Grace.

24:41.222 --> 24:42.963
You have to trust me
and this process.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.815
You two and your
scientific method.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.542
I don't trust this "process."

24:46.560 --> 24:47.968
Look at him.

24:48.062 --> 24:49.803
Whatever you're doing
is making him worse.

24:49.897 --> 24:52.231
If this protocol's gonna work,
it's gonna take time.

24:52.383 --> 24:53.306
Let's get him to the ICU

24:53.475 --> 24:55.567
so we can stabilize him
and monitor him,

24:55.661 --> 24:57.219
and I promise you

24:57.238 --> 24:59.404
that all options will be
available to the both of you.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.865
Fine, and thank you,
but I'd like to call in

25:02.018 --> 25:03.501
Dr. Hawkins
for a second opinion.

25:03.728 --> 25:06.319
I've already paged him
for a consult. He's on his way.

25:06.413 --> 25:07.412
Albert?

25:07.507 --> 25:09.231
I am right here.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.175
It's gonna be okay.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.413
MARIANA:
I'm fine. Yes. Yes. (scoffs)

25:24.506 --> 25:28.008
Don't worry.
Uh-- The doctor's walking in.

25:28.176 --> 25:31.086
I love you, too. Bye.

25:31.179 --> 25:33.346
My husband. Also an architect.

25:33.366 --> 25:34.865
Which is why he isn't here.

25:35.092 --> 25:37.368
He's on-site of a new project
in Memphis.

25:37.444 --> 25:40.704
Dual-career marriage.
I know all about that.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.614
And the people who do it
with children?

25:42.767 --> 25:43.949
Boggles the mind.

25:44.101 --> 25:45.117
-Agreed.
-(chuckles)

25:45.269 --> 25:46.544
My career is all-consuming.

25:46.695 --> 25:50.773
And I'm a perfectionist.
It's a compulsion.

25:50.791 --> 25:53.050
(coughing)

25:53.719 --> 25:55.778
Cough sounds bad.

25:55.796 --> 25:58.013
Let me take a listen.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.392
AUSTIN:
Hey, what's going on?

26:01.543 --> 26:04.119
Hemoptysis
in our pneumothorax patient.

26:04.212 --> 26:05.879
Her lungs sounded clear,
but now...

26:05.973 --> 26:07.472
AUSTIN:
There's still an air leak.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.308
And there's no blood
in the chest tube.

26:09.460 --> 26:12.403
Mariana, we're gonna confer
for a minute, okay?

26:14.407 --> 26:16.073
Okay, so something
more serious is going on.

26:16.224 --> 26:18.576
All right, well,
give me the differential.

26:18.803 --> 26:22.246
It could be an abscess,
bronchiectasis or even cancer.

26:22.397 --> 26:24.248
-A CT should help.
-All right.

26:24.399 --> 26:26.542
Well, let's get her
in the magic box right now.

26:29.330 --> 26:31.146
BELL:
And then this Dr. Abernathy

26:31.239 --> 26:34.240
dismisses the case
as though it was nothing.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.168
Do you think the neurosurgeon's
really culpable?

26:36.262 --> 26:39.430
Well, I'm not gonna condemn him
without solid consideration,

26:39.581 --> 26:42.516
but they refused
to give it any air.

26:48.515 --> 26:49.607
What?

26:49.834 --> 26:52.258
-Does any of this
really surprise you?
-No.

26:53.428 --> 26:55.779
This is why I wanted the job
in the first place.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.449
-So what will you do?

27:10.020 --> 27:11.687
<i> Yes, who's calling?</i>

27:11.780 --> 27:14.206
This is Dr. Randolph Bell
from the state medical board.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.026
I'd like to talk with you
about Dr. Bosley.

27:18.045 --> 27:21.430
<i> Finally. I'd given up hope.</i>

27:25.460 --> 27:26.644
Got your page.

27:26.871 --> 27:28.704
I came as quickly as I could.

27:28.722 --> 27:30.147
Is your emergency handled?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.558
Hard to tell.
How's Albert doing?

27:33.711 --> 27:35.043
Well, we're four doses in.

27:35.137 --> 27:36.545
I've had to give him
broad-spectrum antibiotics

27:36.563 --> 27:39.323
and three liters of fluids,
and he's getting sicker.

27:39.474 --> 27:41.216
I had to start him on norepi.

27:41.235 --> 27:43.994
-You think it's the trial drug?
-I do.

27:44.221 --> 27:45.737
His blood cultures
came back negative,

27:45.890 --> 27:47.572
there's no sign of infection.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.057
And it's time for his next dose.

27:49.059 --> 27:50.501
Ah, that's a tough call.

27:50.652 --> 27:53.912
He's already on a non-rebreather
with a borderline blood gas.

27:54.064 --> 27:55.931
With another dose,
you may have to intubate.

27:55.933 --> 27:57.991
Which could be fatal for Albert.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.677
A ventilator-associated
pneumonia,

27:59.795 --> 28:00.903
with his immune system?

28:00.921 --> 28:03.405
God, and his poor wife.

28:03.498 --> 28:05.182
And the trial?

28:05.333 --> 28:09.335
An intubation would be
an unexpected adverse event,

28:09.430 --> 28:12.356
which could get the trial paused
or stopped altogether.

28:12.507 --> 28:14.099
But if he doesn't
finish the protocol,

28:14.251 --> 28:15.359
and his cancer
only gets worse...

28:15.586 --> 28:18.420
So if I give him the dose,
it could kill him.

28:18.513 --> 28:21.198
And if I hold it, then
everything he's gone through

28:21.425 --> 28:23.534
up until this point
would be completely useless.

28:23.685 --> 28:24.851
There's no good answer.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.079
(sighs)

28:29.375 --> 28:34.044
And Albert's wife, she doesn't
trust me, she trusts you.

28:34.196 --> 28:38.716
Yeah, I'll talk to her,
but let's be clear:

28:38.867 --> 28:39.866
you make the call.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.428
No. Neither of us will.

28:44.114 --> 28:45.597
Albert should decide.

28:53.791 --> 28:55.290
So, your CT was clear.

28:55.292 --> 28:58.218
Which means it's not an abscess,
inflammation or cancer.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.313
Okay, so what's next?

29:01.465 --> 29:02.798
It's good to rule things out.

29:02.816 --> 29:04.967
I am going to circle back
with Dr. Austin, and I...

29:05.060 --> 29:06.651
-(exhales)
-(monitor beeping)

29:06.804 --> 29:09.446
Are you still in pain?

29:09.598 --> 29:10.581
Is it your chest?

29:10.732 --> 29:12.808
It's just, it's just cramps.

29:12.826 --> 29:14.142
The same every month.

29:14.161 --> 29:16.645
Ooh, they're excruciating
sometimes.

29:16.738 --> 29:18.071
Have they always been this bad?

29:18.090 --> 29:20.649
As long as I can remember.

29:20.742 --> 29:22.760
Sometimes I even
get a nosebleed.

29:22.911 --> 29:25.679
It's a real thrill,
being a woman.

29:27.324 --> 29:28.824
The last time
your lung collapsed,

29:28.842 --> 29:30.509
were you also on your period?

29:30.585 --> 29:33.604
Uh, a-as a matter of fact I was.

29:33.755 --> 29:35.347
I... Yeah.

29:35.499 --> 29:39.425
I-I remember I had to ask
for pain meds while I was here.

29:39.445 --> 29:40.669
Why?

29:40.762 --> 29:42.595
Sit tight, I will be right back.

29:42.689 --> 29:44.189
I promise.

29:44.341 --> 29:46.950
<i> AUSTIN:</i>
<i> Endometriosis? Really?</i>

29:47.102 --> 29:48.285
Her pneumothorax coincides
with her periods,

29:48.512 --> 29:50.012
which are abnormally painful.

29:50.105 --> 29:52.122
Isn't it possible
that aberrant endometrial tissue

29:52.274 --> 29:53.624
from her pelvis traveled
through tiny defects

29:53.700 --> 29:56.126
in her diaphragm up
into her chest, where...

29:56.278 --> 29:58.295
Where it continues to respond
to the hormones

29:58.446 --> 30:00.522
of her menstrual cycle,
thus wreaking havoc.

30:00.541 --> 30:03.525
Yeah, it's definitely possible,
but, Devi, that's...

30:03.618 --> 30:05.451
-extremely rare.
-So is having repeated episodes

30:05.471 --> 30:07.805
of pneumothorax with
no discernible cause on imaging.

30:08.032 --> 30:09.197
What if these aren't random?

30:09.291 --> 30:11.291
What if this is evidence
of a problem

30:11.385 --> 30:13.368
her body's been trying
to hide this entire time?

30:14.296 --> 30:16.796
Well, we could get
an MRI for a better look,

30:16.890 --> 30:18.890
but ultimately
the only way to confirm

30:19.043 --> 30:21.043
a catamenial pneumo
is with surgery.

30:21.061 --> 30:23.045
That's thoracic and abdominal.

30:23.063 --> 30:24.637
And if we find
what you think we will,

30:24.657 --> 30:28.158
-that could be a hell
of a procedure.
-That can cure her.

30:28.310 --> 30:29.885
I'm ready for this.

30:29.903 --> 30:31.511
Oh, I know you are.

30:31.513 --> 30:36.074
Devi, you just pulled off a
Conrad Hawkins-level diagnosis.

30:37.077 --> 30:39.127
Let's get your patient ready
and scrub in.

30:41.323 --> 30:43.489
GRACE:
Tell him we can stop,

30:43.509 --> 30:45.734
Dr. Hawkins, please.

30:45.752 --> 30:47.085
Of course we can.

30:47.237 --> 30:50.072
-I've always said that.
-ALBERT: We can't quit

30:50.165 --> 30:52.908
an experiment halfway through.

30:53.077 --> 30:56.061
I tell my students all the time.

30:57.005 --> 30:59.005
This is your life.

30:59.099 --> 31:00.524
You get to be selfish.

31:00.675 --> 31:03.485
You don't have to think
about the greater good.

31:04.922 --> 31:06.530
I am being selfish.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.533
Without the trial, I die.

31:12.037 --> 31:16.481
But you may die sooner with it.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.767
I can't lose you.

31:18.785 --> 31:21.253
Do you think I'm not scared?

31:23.774 --> 31:25.865
-I am.
-(whimpers softly)

31:25.885 --> 31:29.035
But this is what I want to do.

31:29.129 --> 31:32.764
I'm willing to suffer
for the science,

31:32.874 --> 31:36.376
just for a chance, however slim,
to survive this cancer.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.396
I just need you
to support me, please.

31:39.547 --> 31:42.316
-But, Albert...
-Listen, listen.

31:44.128 --> 31:46.153
We're a team, right?

31:47.131 --> 31:48.888
Don't fight Dr. Pravesh.

31:48.982 --> 31:51.391
Just trust him.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.076
And trust me

31:53.228 --> 31:56.496
and honor
what I want and believe.

31:57.565 --> 31:58.957
Okay.

32:00.994 --> 32:03.328
I've decided, Dr. Pravesh.

32:04.164 --> 32:07.549
(grunts)

I thought the state
medical board

32:47.282 --> 32:49.207
had lost all interest

32:49.301 --> 32:50.801

33:03.056 --> 33:05.040
Are you looking
for a financial settlement?

33:05.058 --> 33:06.817
No, I'm looking
for accountability.

33:07.044 --> 33:08.877
He nicked the artery
in my spine.

33:08.895 --> 33:10.045
There was massive bleeding.

33:10.047 --> 33:11.655
My spinal cord was damaged.

33:11.806 --> 33:13.732
I did not have to end up
like this.

33:13.884 --> 33:16.901
I don't want future patients
of Dr. Bosley to, either.

33:17.054 --> 33:19.237
Hey, your case file
says that you received

33:19.389 --> 33:21.814
a second and third opinion
about your outcome.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.559
And that a post-op MRI
would have caught the damage,

33:24.652 --> 33:27.987
and then a second emergency
surgery could have repaired it.

33:28.156 --> 33:30.065
Yes. I might
still be walking today

33:30.083 --> 33:31.508
if Dr. Bosley had
listened to me.

33:31.735 --> 33:34.011
He didn't.

33:37.257 --> 33:40.742
So he says you pushed hard
for the surgery,

33:40.835 --> 33:43.245
That's not the point.

33:43.263 --> 33:45.022
The harm I suffered
during the operation

33:45.098 --> 33:47.107
could have been prevented.

33:48.085 --> 33:51.603
I want the board
to do something.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.280
Will they?

33:56.035 --> 33:58.452
Honestly? Probably not.

34:00.855 --> 34:03.165
But I will do something.

34:09.364 --> 34:11.715
I'm maxed out on norepi,
adding vasopressin.

34:12.626 --> 34:13.550
I hear crackles halfway up,

34:13.777 --> 34:14.718
and he's losing consciousness.

34:14.869 --> 34:16.536
Albert.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.280
Can you hear me?

34:18.282 --> 34:21.132
-We're gonna need to intubate.
-No, not intubation.

34:21.209 --> 34:22.967
He's struggling to breathe,
Grace.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.302
It may be the only thing
to help keep him alive.

34:24.454 --> 34:25.378
I'll grab an intubation tray.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.898
I knew we should have stopped.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.901
My husband, him I understand.

34:30.977 --> 34:32.235
He'll never quit. But you?

34:32.404 --> 34:33.962
You're doctors. You know.

34:33.980 --> 34:35.647
You're supposed to know better.

34:35.799 --> 34:37.315
Why couldn't you stop him?

34:37.467 --> 34:39.467
Grace, you know I respect you
and your husband.

34:39.561 --> 34:42.137
He didn't want to stop,
we have to honor that.

34:42.230 --> 34:44.489
And Dr. Pravesh
has my total support.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.083
I'll be right back.

34:46.234 --> 34:49.961
Add a dialysis line.
His kidneys are shutting down.

34:59.914 --> 35:02.265
Yeah. Just let me know, please.

35:03.994 --> 35:06.436
CONRAD:
Albert's stable for now.

35:08.165 --> 35:09.606
Yeah, well, it doesn't
change the fact

35:09.833 --> 35:14.686
that he walked in here
in decent shape and...

35:14.838 --> 35:17.672
now he's on dialysis
and he's being intubated.

35:17.691 --> 35:18.949
Did you call the study sponsors?

35:19.100 --> 35:21.176
I had to notify them
of the toxicity of the drug,

35:21.194 --> 35:22.694
and now they're deciding
if they're gonna put

35:22.770 --> 35:24.246
the trial on hold.

35:25.682 --> 35:27.607
Grace was right,

35:27.626 --> 35:29.075
I knew the dangers,

35:29.128 --> 35:30.869
I knew the odds for Albert
were getting longer

35:30.963 --> 35:34.113
every single hour.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.281
I shouldn't have
listened to him,

35:35.375 --> 35:36.967
except I know
that I should have.

35:37.194 --> 35:38.710
You followed
the patient's wishes.

35:38.862 --> 35:40.220
It was the right move.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.366
Albert knew exactly
what he was doing.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.144
I feel like a general
who's sending my soldiers

35:47.295 --> 35:49.521
out into the battlefield
to face a line of machine guns

35:49.706 --> 35:51.556
while I stand in safety.

35:51.708 --> 35:52.724
All wars have casualties.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.152
And they also have triumphs.

35:55.379 --> 35:58.029
It's the same
with clinical trials.

36:01.643 --> 36:03.976
I want Albert to survive.

36:03.996 --> 36:07.647
I want him to teach his kids
for years to come.

36:07.741 --> 36:10.575
So they can visit him
in his happy retirement.

36:10.652 --> 36:12.502
He deserves that.

36:13.580 --> 36:15.655
This isn't over.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.415
The intubation bought him time.

36:17.509 --> 36:21.011
So... next steps.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.906
All right, what we know now
is that he's battling

36:24.925 --> 36:27.184
massive inflammation
from the trial drug.

36:27.335 --> 36:28.910
So, if we treat
the inflammation...

36:28.929 --> 36:30.020
I hesitated to give him steroids

36:30.171 --> 36:32.672
because I thought
he was infected, but...

36:32.766 --> 36:34.006
We should go for it-- plus toci.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.008
If all his cultures
have been negative, yeah.

36:36.102 --> 36:38.153
It could help more
than it could hurt him.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.405
Let's do it.

36:43.017 --> 36:44.592
Endometriosis fits
your symptoms.

36:44.611 --> 36:45.944
You check all the boxes.

36:46.096 --> 36:48.020
You know, most doctors
don't ask women

36:48.040 --> 36:50.207
the right question
to make these connections.

36:50.358 --> 36:52.042
That's why it can
take years to diagnose.

36:52.193 --> 36:54.527
But if we're right,
we can fix this.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.214
AUSTIN:
But we do need to be clear
about what this means for you.

36:57.365 --> 36:59.532
This condition can
affect your fertility.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.943
Now, with surgery,
you should end up pain-free,

37:02.036 --> 37:03.611
but if we find extensive damage,

37:03.705 --> 37:07.724
you are aware that you may not
be able to have children, right?

37:07.875 --> 37:09.300
I discussed it with my husband.

37:09.453 --> 37:11.286
He's flying in to be with me.

37:11.455 --> 37:14.547
He's okay with never
having children.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.881
And you?

37:15.901 --> 37:17.067
W-We're on the same page.

37:17.218 --> 37:19.961
We're focused on each other,
and our careers.

37:19.980 --> 37:21.980
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.366
AUSTIN:
You're absolutely right.

37:26.653 --> 37:28.060
His MAPs are solid.

37:28.229 --> 37:30.472
I'm gonna titrate down
the norepi.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.292
-That's an improvement.
-Not enough.

37:34.995 --> 37:37.170
What do the labs say?

37:39.424 --> 37:40.648
Just tell me.

37:40.742 --> 37:43.176
Look for yourself.

37:47.081 --> 37:49.081
His blood gas looks good.

37:49.175 --> 37:51.417
We can turn down
his oxygen to 40%.

37:52.345 --> 37:55.497
And his liver function
is normalizing.

37:55.665 --> 37:56.940
He's turning around.

37:57.167 --> 37:58.591
(exhales)

37:58.610 --> 38:00.151
He's gonna be okay.

38:02.672 --> 38:04.597
Yes. Yes.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.008
Albert will make it
through this trial.

38:07.177 --> 38:09.527
You have given him
a chance to survive.

38:09.679 --> 38:11.496
You did it.

38:23.193 --> 38:25.209
He's looking better, right?

38:25.362 --> 38:28.863
He already wants to send
a video to his students.

38:28.956 --> 38:30.548
I tell them every day,

38:30.642 --> 38:35.219
record even the most incremental
progress in your experiments.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.440
-This is more than incremental.
-(chuckles softly)

38:39.709 --> 38:42.043
When you're ready,
I'll set up a transfer

38:42.062 --> 38:44.321
back to the room
with the comfy chair.

38:47.809 --> 38:49.551
(exhales)

38:49.569 --> 38:53.312
Albert, I owe you an apology.
Grace, you, too.

38:53.406 --> 38:56.574
I just had no idea
it was gonna get this bad.

38:56.726 --> 38:59.002
You were doing your job.

38:59.229 --> 39:01.396
I'm sorry I got so angry.

39:01.489 --> 39:04.582
Oh, stop, both of you. I was
a willing guinea pig, remember?

39:04.734 --> 39:07.068
A human petri dish.

39:07.087 --> 39:10.088
Besides, it worked.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.739
Well, we know you can get
through the doses.

39:11.758 --> 39:14.409
But we don't actually know if
it's gonna help your cancer yet.

39:14.502 --> 39:17.896
But I have a chance.
More than I had before.

39:19.006 --> 39:22.917
See? I told you
to trust Dr. Pravesh.

39:23.010 --> 39:24.268
-You were right.
-Mm.

39:24.363 --> 39:27.513
Like two peas in a pod,
you science nerds.

39:27.607 --> 39:29.366
That's right.

39:29.442 --> 39:31.016
Now, here's the real question.

39:31.036 --> 39:34.019
Who can recite
the periodic table faster?

39:34.039 --> 39:35.613
-Did you just challenge me?
-Yes, I did.

39:35.782 --> 39:37.874
No-- Actually, no,
y-you need to get some rest.

39:38.059 --> 39:40.768
Hydrogen, helium, lithium...

39:40.862 --> 39:42.545
Okay, okay, okay. You win.

39:42.697 --> 39:43.938
-(laughs)
-You win.

39:44.031 --> 39:45.106
<i> WOMAN (over P.A. system):</i>
<i> Imaging,</i>

39:45.125 --> 39:46.549
<i> please dial 2732...</i>

39:46.701 --> 39:50.778
Oh, well, well, well, if
it isn't the queen of Chastain.

39:50.872 --> 39:53.056
Hey.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.058
-Ah...
-(giggles)

39:55.209 --> 39:57.543
-Oh. Nice.
-You like that, right?

39:57.637 --> 39:59.729
Hey, man, I heard
Devon's clinical trial

39:59.881 --> 40:01.213
passed the first test.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.457
Yeah, barely.

40:02.550 --> 40:05.309
The protocol was worse
than anyone imagined.

40:05.462 --> 40:07.812
Your mom wouldn't
have survived it, AJ.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.815
Well, we have no regrets.

40:10.967 --> 40:12.075
You know what she did today?

40:12.302 --> 40:13.801
She made three different
kind of muffins

40:13.820 --> 40:16.729
and she took a walk
through the botanical gardens.

40:16.823 --> 40:20.808
Telling you, brother,
palliative care was a good call.

40:20.902 --> 40:21.976
So, uh...

40:22.069 --> 40:26.481
do we need to talk
about the new ER doc?

40:26.499 --> 40:27.999
-Okay.
-Yeah.

40:28.075 --> 40:30.501
Look, I'm just saying,
I like her.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.170
No BS, no sugarcoating.

40:32.322 --> 40:34.246
Uh, she's definitely
an interesting case.

40:34.415 --> 40:36.991
"Interesting."
That sounds mysterious.

40:37.010 --> 40:39.510
Come on, man.
Give up the backstory.

40:39.663 --> 40:41.162
No, do not go there.

40:41.331 --> 40:43.181
(chuckles):
You know something I don't?

40:43.333 --> 40:45.108
I thought you two might have
something going on.

40:45.335 --> 40:47.335
-Just colleagues.
-Yeah, for now.

40:47.353 --> 40:51.614
No. I already have
one lady in my life.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.265
Me.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.009
-I'll catch you tomorrow.
-All right.

40:55.028 --> 40:56.527
See you later, cutie-pie.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.103
Bye.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.290
The unicorn book, you promised.

41:00.517 --> 41:01.849
CONRAD:
What?

41:01.868 --> 41:04.294
Unicorn book? I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:04.521 --> 41:08.039
-(laughs): Daddy.
-I didn't forget, sweetheart.

41:08.191 --> 41:12.093
Happy the Bloodhound
is coming right up.

41:16.183 --> 41:18.032
LEELA:
I'm so proud of you.

41:18.051 --> 41:20.718
DEVON:
And I'm proud of you.

41:20.870 --> 41:25.039
You made a tough diagnosis
most doctors would miss.

41:25.058 --> 41:27.542
And you got your patient

41:27.560 --> 41:31.045
through a very rough surgery,
Leela.

41:31.064 --> 41:34.306
Well, I really admire Mariana.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.475
And I'm really glad
I got to know her a bit.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.143
She's a successful
businesswoman,

41:38.163 --> 41:42.056
and an unapologetic
control freak,

41:42.149 --> 41:45.835
with a very successful husband
in the same business.

41:46.062 --> 41:47.228
Sounds familiar.

41:47.247 --> 41:49.655
And she wasn't at all afraid
of a condition

41:49.824 --> 41:50.673
that could make her infertile,

41:50.900 --> 41:52.175
because she doesn't want kids.

41:52.326 --> 41:54.736
I mean, there are people
like that.

41:54.754 --> 41:56.346
I'm just not one of them.

41:58.591 --> 42:01.476
(exhales)
I want to have a family one day.

42:03.355 --> 42:04.521
With you.

42:05.932 --> 42:08.933
We need to talk about this.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.510
I don't know if I want kids.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.104
At least not right now.

42:13.198 --> 42:17.258
I could not manage
surgical residency and a family.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.518
Yeah, I get that.

42:19.687 --> 42:20.778
And it can wait.
We have plenty of time.

42:20.930 --> 42:23.414
Devon, it could be a long while.

42:24.934 --> 42:27.952
Leela, all kinds of doctors
manage it.

42:28.104 --> 42:30.605
I mean, there are work-arounds.

42:30.698 --> 42:33.457
I believe that, I just...

42:33.610 --> 42:38.179
I don't know if it'll ever be
the right thing for me.

42:39.949 --> 42:43.284
Which is why I-I realized

42:43.303 --> 42:45.970
that what Padma wants
can help us both.

42:46.122 --> 42:48.139
I can give her the egg
she so desperately wants,

42:48.233 --> 42:50.433
so she can have a baby,
and at the same time,

42:50.660 --> 42:54.195
I can freeze some for me.
For us.

42:55.799 --> 42:56.798
For the future.

42:56.966 --> 42:59.317
Yes.

42:59.469 --> 43:03.246
Just to give me time
to think about it.

43:05.066 --> 43:07.992
But that's all I can promise
right now.

43:08.144 --> 43:10.420
Can you live with that?
