WEBVTT

00:03.212 --> 00:04.805
LANA :
Wait, here's an idea:

00:04.963 --> 00:07.011
You talk louder,
maybe they'll come to us.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.097
We'd lose the element of surprise, Lana.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.351
That was sarcasm.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.185
No way, really?
Because so was that, just now.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.520
I pretty much insist that you shut up.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.934
Shit, they're in the armory.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.147
Good, we got them.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.438
This is the only way out.
Of the armory.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.777
I heard you. And I can also read, so--

00:22.940 --> 00:24.783
So, what's in the armory?

00:24.942 --> 00:28.822
Burglars, Lana, that's why I'm here
and not up to my ears in stewardess.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.284
What else is in the armory?

00:30.447 --> 00:32.825
Well, a bunch of automatic weapons,
rocket launchers...

00:32.991 --> 00:35.710
...uh, about a jillion grenades-- Oh.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.463
They may have fire superiority.
You think?

00:38.622 --> 00:41.967
For all we know they're building
a Gundam suit with bazookas for hands.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.378
Really wish we had some backup.
Who, Cyril?

00:44.545 --> 00:47.799
Or, oh, maybe Ray could
run over them with his wheelchair.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.595
That was also sarcasm, since apparently
now we're saying whenever we do it.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.137
Are you ready?
No.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.556
Sarcasm again. Yes, I'm ready.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.447
What are you doing?
Nothing!

01:07.609 --> 01:09.156
LANA: Archer!
What...

01:09.319 --> 01:12.664
...the hell are you doing?
Nothing. What're y'all doing?

01:12.823 --> 01:16.669
The alarm company called us because
the motion sensors were going off.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.377
Dukes.
Yeah, we got new keycodes Monday...

01:20.539 --> 01:23.839
...but you were... Where was it?
Physical therapy.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.800
For your limp, useless legs.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.964
Well, it's obviously working,
you're on a--

01:29.131 --> 01:31.759
Wait a minute!
How are you walking around on ladders?

01:31.925 --> 01:35.771
Because he's not paralyzed!
And is that not the stuff of miracles?

01:35.929 --> 01:38.853
You lying little--
I never said I was paralyzed!

01:39.016 --> 01:40.268
Y'all just assumed I was!

01:40.434 --> 01:42.732
Because you left the hospital
in a wheelchair!

01:42.894 --> 01:44.111
They make you!

01:44.271 --> 01:47.024
Then I couldn't get a cab,
so I got back in the chair and--

01:47.190 --> 01:49.818
Spent the last six months pretending
to be handicapped.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.032
Handi-capable.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.539
Before I kick this ladder over
in the hopes of paralyzing you for real...

01:54.698 --> 01:57.201
...why are you in here
stealing guns and grenades...

01:57.367 --> 01:59.665
...in what better not be
my night-vision goggles?

01:59.828 --> 02:02.707
I kind of have some family problems.

02:02.873 --> 02:07.549
So your brother, the drug dealer--
He's not a drug dealer! He's a drug farmer.

02:07.711 --> 02:11.682
Whatever, is gonna be murdered
by your hometown's crooked sheriff?

02:11.840 --> 02:15.265
E.Z. Ponder, yeah, and he used to
bully me so bad in high school--

02:15.427 --> 02:17.304
No! Ray, that was sarcasm.

02:17.471 --> 02:22.398
Anyway, he wants Randy's dope farm for
himself or he'll kill him, so I gotta go and...

02:22.559 --> 02:24.027
...stop him.
Count me in.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.233
What? Why?

02:25.395 --> 02:29.070
Well, for one thing, it's eerily similar
to the plot of White Lightning...

02:29.232 --> 02:32.202
...and this is Ray's brother.
What's more important than family?

02:32.361 --> 02:36.707
Mm, getting hammered on moonshine
and trying to bang skanky trailer chicks?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.288
Um, trying?
Oh, that reminds me.

02:39.451 --> 02:43.206
Um, they all think I'm married to,
like, a woman, so...

02:43.413 --> 02:45.381
Oh, all right, I'll be your beard.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.920
What are you, insane? "Hey y'all,
here's my great big old black wife!"

02:50.087 --> 02:53.261
Lana, come on. You're gigantic.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.167 --> 03:32.592
MALORY: Now, what's all this nonsense
about a break-in last night?

03:32.754 --> 03:36.133
I swear to God,
if Krieger was doing more of his--

03:36.299 --> 03:38.301
What's his new, awful thing?

03:38.468 --> 03:41.893
Ultimate Bum Shockfights, and no,
it looks like it was an actual break-in.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.102
What?
Jeezy Petes!

03:43.265 --> 03:46.439
Did they get into the mainframe?
I don't know, but--

03:46.601 --> 03:48.103
We need Sterling. Where is he?

03:48.270 --> 03:49.487
He's tracking down...

03:49.646 --> 03:53.150
...um, leads. From the clues.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.488
That there were some of.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.404
What kind of clues?
The kind I'm gonna show you...

03:57.571 --> 04:00.120
...if you're not too busy
shutting up to come on.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.535
Put Sterling through
the minute he calls in!

04:02.701 --> 04:04.248
ARCHER:
Which I guess will be never.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.084
So are there just no towers here?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.419
Or have we literally gone back in time?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.343
GILLETTE: Both.
CHERYL: Ow! You dumb idiot!

04:11.501 --> 04:12.718
BOTH:
Great.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.757
Why am I in a, whatever, dune buggy?

04:15.922 --> 04:19.176
Remember? We picked you up last night,
said we were going on a trip?

04:19.341 --> 04:23.017
No, and to where? Six Flags Over
The Shittier Parts of Chernobyl?

04:23.180 --> 04:26.024
Ferlin, West Virginia.
Yeah, and you and Ray are married.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.812
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
We're not actually--

04:29.978 --> 04:33.152
Actually, it'll be better if she thinks--
We're married!

04:33.315 --> 04:34.362
Supen
Ray, look out!

04:36.860 --> 04:41.536
Two questions: Is that the sheriff
and have you recently gone insane?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.666
Yes and no.
Respectively?

04:43.825 --> 04:46.544
Now, I know that ain't who I think it is.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.422
No shit! Ray Gillet!
ARCHER: Gillet?

04:49.581 --> 04:52.835
How in the hell are you?
Pretty good, E.Z. How you doing?

04:53.001 --> 04:55.754
Can't complain.
Ain't nobody'd listen if I did.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.555
I hear that.
You hear what?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.016
Not that?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.564
What brings you back up the holler?

05:06.723 --> 05:10.569
Oh, you know, just wanted to show off
my pretty new bride to the home folks.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.944
Mm, she is that.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.614
For a minute there I was thinking
maybe you come back...

05:18.777 --> 05:20.324
...to help your brother out with his...

05:20.487 --> 05:24.082
...business concerns.
No, just back for a visit.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.868
Well, make sure it's a short one.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.880
Because believe me when I tell you,
ain't nothing you can do to help him.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.296
Y'all drive safe now, hear?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.461
Man. Is it me or is he super menacing?

05:36.628 --> 05:40.258
Or super hot?
Hey! Remember? We're married?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.266
Not until it's consummated.

05:42.425 --> 05:46.851
I'll drive if you wanna hop back there
and, um, enter her.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.603
So not only is Ray not paralyzed,
but his brother is a drug dealer--

05:52.769 --> 05:55.613
Farmer.
He and Archer are in West Virginia doing...

05:55.772 --> 05:58.742
What are they doing?
Fighting a war on the war on drugs?

05:58.900 --> 05:59.947
Goddamn it.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.908
What?
You should've looked under the stalls.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.950
I did! Wait, I did.
I usually put my feet up on the grab bars.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.960
Ugh. Anyway,
this is all obviously unauthorized...

06:09.119 --> 06:11.463
...but I promised Ray
we'd cover for him, so--

06:11.621 --> 06:14.841
Oh, no! I'm not getting mixed up in this,
and if Ms. Archer asks me--

06:15.000 --> 06:18.630
Why is it that every time
I need to use the restroom...

06:18.795 --> 06:21.719
...you people are in here
skulking around looking guilty?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.384
Uh...

06:23.633 --> 06:25.306
I'll tell you why they look guilty.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.603
Because they, or we, I guess,
don't know how to tell you...

06:30.765 --> 06:34.440
...that the break-in was
a lot worse than we thought.

06:34.603 --> 06:35.650
How much worse?

06:35.812 --> 06:38.235
Uh, well, it's really hard to say.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.572
But rest assured we are on it,
and Archer is on it, and...

06:41.735 --> 06:44.329
We're on it.
Well, I want an update in one hour!

06:45.697 --> 06:47.995
And why does it always reek of paint?

06:48.158 --> 06:51.332
GILLETTE:
Well, there she is. The old homestead.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.917
Jesus, what's my dowry? Tetanus?
Hey, you know what?

06:55.332 --> 06:56.379
ARCHER:
Jesus!

06:56.541 --> 06:58.339
MAN:
That's far enough, you sons of bitches!

06:58.501 --> 07:00.299
Randy, it's me! Ray! Your brother!

07:00.629 --> 07:03.007
Don't you move. Don't move a inch.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.972
What do you mean "don't move"?
I came to help you, asshole!

07:06.134 --> 07:08.887
Well, you ain't gonna be much help
with your legs blown off.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.522
There's mines all in the yard.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.480
Ray, to be honest, I'm kind of having
second thoughts about this whole thing.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.772
Uh, get in line.
Randy Gillet, where are your manners?

07:17.938 --> 07:21.363
Get these folks a map of that damn
minefield so they can come inside.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.528
I got some nice hot pie for them.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.164
Okay, now I'm having third thoughts.
Oh, please don't.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.200
It would be rude not to eat her pie.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.871
Which I assume is not only hot
but also moist.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.914
Although hopefully not flaky.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.919
And so E.Z. gave me a choice:

07:41.086 --> 07:44.306
Give him my whole dang operation,
get out of the holler by sundown...

07:44.464 --> 07:48.014
...or else him and his boys'll just take it
and grind me up into fertilizer.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.178
GILLETTE: Well...
But listen to me, just yapping.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.518
Tell me about this
pretty new wife of yours.

07:52.681 --> 07:56.402
Because I'm kind of surprised
to see you married.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.153
Ha, ha, ha.
Homeboy knows what I'm talking about.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.067
He does?
A New York City interior decorator?

08:03.233 --> 08:06.988
That's what you went with?
Bet you're up to your eyeballs in poontang!

08:07.153 --> 08:09.406
Oh, yeah, just so many...

08:09.572 --> 08:12.166
...vaginae.
Oh, no offense, darling.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.544
Ahem. None taken.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.501
Want some more of my pie, Mr. Archer?

08:16.663 --> 08:17.915
No!
Yes!

08:18.081 --> 08:22.052
Thank you, Janelle, I would love
more of your moist and hot pie.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.180
Well, then open wide.
RANDY: Okay!

08:25.338 --> 08:27.932
Folks, we can't sit around
eating her pie all day.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.593
We got a situation here.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.104
Krieger's running the logs to see
if any files were accessed last night.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.936
Who the hell could have done this?

08:35.097 --> 08:38.398
Who knows? ODIN, the KGB...
Actually--

08:38.559 --> 08:42.405
But this will take hours, so we'll just
bring you a report when it's done.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.612
Actually--
Krieger. More type, less gripe.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.870
And has anyone heard from Sterling?
No-- Yes! He's out...

08:49.112 --> 08:52.616
...on the case.
Well I want some answers, and soon.

08:52.782 --> 08:57.333
And since there's nothing in these logs,
I, too, would like some answers.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.793
So here's the thing...

08:59.956 --> 09:03.426
If I can just get what I got
to my distributor, I can retire.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.885
Maybe move up to New York City with you.
I-- What, where, do what?

09:07.047 --> 09:11.553
Heh, I'm kidding. Last thing you want's
your redneck brother hanging around.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.097
No, it's not that, it's--
Plus I'd rather kill myself.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.641
Nothing up there
but a bunch of you-know-whats.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.480
Yeah, there are a lot of them.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.020
Don't see how you stand it.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.901
Anyhow...

09:24.564 --> 09:25.611
Dude.
Awesome.

09:25.774 --> 09:29.153
GILLETTE: Sweet, gracious God.
RANDY: This here's what E.Z. wants.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.289
How did you afford all this?
Farm subsidy.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.576
He told the government he's growing
corn for "high-flooktose" syrup.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.495
But damned if I'm gonna contribute
to the obesity epidemic.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.663
Hey, a man's gotta have a code.
Right?

09:40.830 --> 09:43.128
I put my heart and soul into this...

09:43.291 --> 09:47.296
...but now it's either roll over
for that sheriff like a dog or fight.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.760
Like a different, better dog.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.517
So is it just E.Z. coming, or--?
No.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.349
The whole sheriff's department.
I'd say 2O men...

09:55.512 --> 09:59.608
...AR-15s, maybe grenades.
Oh, dogs! Duh.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.689
Ray, I'm having fourth thoughts.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.525
Well, I got a few tricks up my sleeve.

10:04.687 --> 10:08.817
Janelle, why don't you take Mr. Archer
and show him the defensive perimeter?

10:08.983 --> 10:11.327
I'd be delighted.
Whoa, no, wait a second--

10:11.486 --> 10:12.578
Fifth thoughts!
Archer!

10:12.737 --> 10:14.614
Don't worry, she won't bite.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.954
But speaking of, it's about suppertime.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.494
You still partial to fried chicken?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.879
I'll cook it!
If someone shaves it or whatever.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.550
What--?
What in the--? Janelle? Janelle!

10:25.708 --> 10:27.961
Randy, wait! Dukes!

10:28.211 --> 10:31.761
So is there, like,
special chicken shaving cream, or...?

10:31.923 --> 10:34.142
First of all, that is a rooster!

10:34.300 --> 10:38.271
Yeah, like Kenny Rogers' Roosters.
Roasters! Randy, wait!

10:40.390 --> 10:42.893
And just what the hell is this?

10:43.059 --> 10:46.654
Um, well, I'll tell you what it's not,
which is what it looks like.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.612
I got caught on the fence,
Mr. Archer tried to get me loose--

10:49.816 --> 10:52.239
You better get your ass in that house.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.489
Do you wanna have sex with my wife?

10:55.655 --> 11:00.081
No, I swear, this was just an extremely
unlikely mishap with the barbed wire.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.541
Because we would be amenable to that.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.665
Well? Why you look so nonplussed?

11:05.832 --> 11:08.927
Because I wasn't sure if you knew
what amenable actually meant.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.383
Until you followed it up with nonplussed.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.174
See, me and Janelle got us
one of them open marriages...

11:14.340 --> 11:16.934
...like in France.
Oh, right, in Europe.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.267
And I would really like
that open marriage to include...

11:20.430 --> 11:21.773
...Ray's new wife.
What?

11:21.931 --> 11:24.229
Now, look, that's in the Bible.
Really?

11:24.392 --> 11:26.440
Genesis 38, verse eight.
Really?

11:26.603 --> 11:30.153
Even though Ray used to be a preacher,
he was never big on the Old Testament.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.444
I could see that.
So I doubt he'd wanna reciprocate.

11:33.610 --> 11:37.786
So I just need you to keep him busy
while I have sex with his wife--

11:37.947 --> 11:41.292
And then I get to have sex with--
My wife, you son of a bitch!

11:41.451 --> 11:44.580
Yeah, I think I got--
So where the hell's your damn pants?

11:44.746 --> 11:46.794
They're on the fence!
Goddamn it, Archer!

11:46.956 --> 11:48.333
Hang on--
Archer, shut up!

11:48.499 --> 11:52.470
Ray, he was-- And then poor Janelle...

11:52.629 --> 11:55.599
Oh, I gotta go make sure she's okay!

11:55.798 --> 11:58.472
And you better have a talk with him!

11:58.635 --> 12:01.809
I will, Randy, I'm sorry.
A good, long talk.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.145
Like, talk for about 40, 45 minutes.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.736
ARCHER: Okay, so--
Aah.

12:07.894 --> 12:12.946
I have never, in my entire life, been
as disgusted <i>as</i> I am at this moment.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.075
Well, give it a minute.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.158
What do you mean, a cyber-attack?

12:17.320 --> 12:21.245
Apparently the intruders downloaded
a virus into the mainframe.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.785
So this all needs to come out.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.796
The mainframe is Krieger's baby.
How'd you get him to go in?

12:26.955 --> 12:30.630
I told him I'd get Pam to fight
in his Ultimate Bum Shockfights.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.089
Is it called that because...

12:32.252 --> 12:34.471
...paying homeless men
to fight is shocking?

12:34.629 --> 12:35.721
Nope.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.009
Well, hello there, game-changer.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.974
He what?
Yeah, apparently it's in the Bible?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.183
No, it isn't!

12:43.346 --> 12:45.314
It did sound too cool for the Bible.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.567
But why do you care? A, you're gay...

12:47.725 --> 12:49.648
...and B, you and Carol
aren't really married.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.529
But Randy thinks we are!

12:51.688 --> 12:53.782
Yeah, but--
That's actually a really good point.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.363
I am gonna beat him like a rented mule!

12:56.526 --> 12:59.496
Now that sounds like something
from the Bible.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.497
She in there?
Yeah. Where's mine at'?

13:01.656 --> 13:02.748
In the woods with Ray.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.332
You gotta wait till later, maybe after supper.
Remember: No kissing.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.839
I wasn't... That is the weirdest rule.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.046
CHERYL:
I know, right? Some honeymoon.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.051
Oh, hey, do I do the face?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.717
And where the hell is Sterling
when I need him?

13:16.879 --> 13:19.428
<i>ARCHER :
You've reached Sterling Archer's voice-mail.</i>

13:19.590 --> 13:20.887
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

13:21.050 --> 13:23.724
Wha--? Finally, a non-idiotic greeting.

13:23.886 --> 13:28.141
Sterling, I want an update, so call me
the instant you get this mess--

13:28.308 --> 13:30.060
<i>WOMAN :
The voice mailbox of...</i>

13:30.226 --> 13:31.318
<i>ARCH E R:
Sterling Archer.</i>

13:31.477 --> 13:34.902
<i>WOMAN: ...is full. Goodbye.
ARCHER: Idiot. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

13:38.359 --> 13:41.078
Come here, you skinny-legged
son of a bitch!

13:41.237 --> 13:44.537
Oh! Sorry.
That's okay, they're not my best feature.

13:44.699 --> 13:45.951
No, I was--
Not important.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.246
What is important is that
Randy gave me a Bible lesson.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.756
Yeah? And what did the Bible say?

13:51.914 --> 13:56.044
Well, Janelle, obviously the actual scripture
is open to interpretation...

13:56.210 --> 13:57.803
...but what I took away from it...

13:57.962 --> 13:59.839
...is that we should go in the barn...

14:00.006 --> 14:02.759
...and screw our brains out
on a huge pile of marijuana.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.054
It didn't say nothing about a rubber,
did it?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.563
It did not.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.484
Ray's still up in the woods, right?
Uh... Oh.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.145
Uh, no, he actually said
he wanted to talk to--

14:14.312 --> 14:15.404
GILLETTE:
Randy!

14:15.563 --> 14:17.361
RANDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
now hang on a second!

14:17.523 --> 14:18.991
GILLETTE:
You white trash piece of--

14:20.568 --> 14:22.286
Randy!

14:22.445 --> 14:27.076
Yes. Randy. Which I probably
should've mentioned earlier.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.455
Don't judge me. Food.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.260
You lucky I didn't kill you.
You're lucky I didn't kill you!

14:37.418 --> 14:41.423
While you were in bed with my wife!
Our marriage was never consummated!

14:41.589 --> 14:43.933
And I think we all know why.
Carol!

14:44.092 --> 14:47.938
There's plenty of blame to go around
here. I don't think I deserve any, but--

14:48.096 --> 14:50.815
You were gonna screw her!
Yeah, so? Is that still on, or...?

14:52.266 --> 14:53.313
Carol?
Wha--?

14:53.476 --> 14:55.319
Somebody,
come on, promises were made.

14:55.478 --> 14:58.607
Just like you promised Mama and Daddy
you'd always take care of me.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.652
And here we go.
They weren't even cold in the ground...

15:01.818 --> 15:03.570
...before you were gallivanting
around Europe!

15:03.736 --> 15:04.988
It was the Olympics!

15:05.154 --> 15:08.328
Which you lost!
Bronze medal is not losing!

15:08.491 --> 15:11.290
Then off to New York City.
You can just say New York.

15:11.452 --> 15:15.753
To be a hoity-toity interior decorator.
You can just say decorator.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.839
Whatever, I don't know why
I thought he could help save my farm.

15:19.001 --> 15:24.349
Because your job? That's a job for sissies.
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what!

15:24.507 --> 15:27.602
Ray is not an interior decorator.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.933
L-- No, you know what?
Yes, shut up.

15:30.096 --> 15:34.522
Randy, your seemingly effeminate brother
is actually a highly trained secret agent.

15:34.684 --> 15:40.862
Pssh. Yeah, and I'm something
equally hard to believe is true.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.991
It is true, that's why I married him.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.199
Well, and the bronze medal.
Prove it.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.704
What do you want, a business card?

15:46.863 --> 15:49.582
Where do you think he got
a bag full of assault weapons?

15:49.740 --> 15:52.368
Well, y'all do live in New York City.
Just New York.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.503
Ray? Is he telling the truth?

15:54.662 --> 15:58.257
Mostly.
So because you're a spy...

15:58.416 --> 16:00.418
...is that why you never
come back to visit?

16:00.585 --> 16:01.962
Mm, also mostly.

16:02.128 --> 16:06.429
Aw. And here all this time I thought
it was because you were ashamed of us.

16:06.591 --> 16:10.471
Oh, come on, why would you think that?
Well, I found a bunch of your old diaries.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.059
Obviously not the one
with Miss Piggy on it.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.815
No, Daddy said he burned that one.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.729
Ah, great.
And I am sorry I screwed your wife.

16:18.895 --> 16:22.365
And I'm sorry if I ever made you
feel like I was ashamed of you.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.402
The important thing
is you came back to help me.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.366
Come on, that's what family's all ab--

16:28.738 --> 16:29.910
Shit!
Oh, damn it!

16:30.114 --> 16:34.244
PONDER:
Randy Gillet! This is Sheriff E.Z. Ponder!

16:34.410 --> 16:36.253
Come out of there with your hands up!

16:36.412 --> 16:38.164
Oh. That son of a bitch is early.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.301
I don't know, "sundown" sounds
more colloquial than an actual--

16:41.459 --> 16:44.429
If you wanna back out on me,
now's probably the time to do that.

16:44.587 --> 16:48.637
Randy, you may be a racist, homophobic,
wife-swapping drug dealer...

16:48.799 --> 16:51.928
Farmer.
...but nobody murders my brother.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.096
The Gillet boys, side by side.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.563
Janelle, cover that window yonder.
Archer, got a little fight in you?

17:02.063 --> 17:06.534
Whoo! Ugh. Yeah, I'm pretty furious
about not getting to bang Janelle.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.366
Plus I want to unleash
the power of moonshine.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.032
Then grab a gun and cover that window!
What should I do?

17:13.199 --> 17:15.122
I got red hot pokers laying in that fire.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.538
If anybody gets hit,
you grab one and slap iron to it.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.752
Awesome.
And remember, it's us or them.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.381
So this is how it's gonna be, huh?

17:24.544 --> 17:28.549
Randy, I didn't want it like this!
Now, come on, I tried to reason with you!

17:28.714 --> 17:29.886
RANDY:
Reason with this!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.978
PONDER:
All right, then! Light them up!

17:37.974 --> 17:39.851
JANELLE: Ow!
Janelle! Are you hit?

17:40.017 --> 17:41.314
No! A piece of glas--

17:45.022 --> 17:47.150
Well, don't just sit there! Shoot!

17:47.316 --> 17:51.992
Ugh. I can't. I feel sick. What's happening?
Do I have cancer again?

17:52.154 --> 17:54.156
You drank too much!
That's a thing?

17:55.116 --> 17:57.244
Looks like it's just you and me, brother.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.248
Randy, you don't have to do this.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.714
They'll go easy on you.
Hell, the judge is my wife's cousin.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.627
I bet he'll give you probation.

18:06.794 --> 18:10.640
Oh, please! You're gonna murder him
so you can take over his dope farm!

18:10.798 --> 18:14.268
What? Cease fire! Hold your fire!

18:14.427 --> 18:19.729
Why in the world would you think that I,
a peace officer sworn to uphold the law...

18:19.890 --> 18:22.985
...would wanna murder your brother
and get his marijuana farm?

18:23.144 --> 18:27.194
L-- Because that's what Randy said!
Randy's a drug dealer.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.279
Farmer!
And I tried to get him to quit.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.694
I come to him as a friend...

18:30.860 --> 18:34.535
...I come to him as an elder of the church,
but he wouldn't give it up.

18:34.697 --> 18:39.794
And so now I gotta come to him as the law.
And you accuse me of planning a murder?

18:39.952 --> 18:44.048
Well, you did used to pick on me a bunch.
Well, I'm sorry.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.379
I was a dick in high school.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.137
But you gotta admit,
you were extremely pick-on-able.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.469
There's nothing wrong with Capezios!

18:53.841 --> 18:55.969
Randy? Is he telling the truth?

18:56.427 --> 18:58.054
Mostly.
Randy!

18:58.220 --> 19:00.188
You almost got me and my friends killed!

19:00.348 --> 19:03.147
Because you could never
be bothered to get a real job!

19:03.309 --> 19:05.778
Well, I only got to ninth grade!

19:05.936 --> 19:08.735
How else was I supposed to
earn a living? Digging 'seng?

19:08.898 --> 19:12.493
There is a perfectly good coal mine
not a half-mile from here.

19:12.652 --> 19:17.032
And maybe you wouldn't get rich,
but at least it's an honest living.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.245
Yeah, but it's hard.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.076
So is this.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.750
Randy!
Shut up. And Mama never liked you.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.257
E.Z., don't shoot! Ahem, I'm coming out!

19:26.415 --> 19:29.089
Ha, ha, ha. Phrasing.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.300
Here's the files you had me pull.

19:32.463 --> 19:36.513
Ow! What the hell is on your hands?
My bum-zappers.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.474
For the shockfights?

19:38.636 --> 19:42.561
That I'm doing for Krieger, which is why he
broke the server, to help Lana cover up...

19:42.723 --> 19:45.272
...that Ray and Archer
are killing cops for a dealer...

19:45.434 --> 19:47.402
...and Ray's been faking
that he's paralyzed?

19:48.104 --> 19:50.607
Lana!

19:50.773 --> 19:53.902
Or are we not telling you that?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.285
No.

19:55.444 --> 19:59.165
Thank God you guys got here
before they started killing hostages.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.247
Which would have been us.
As the hostages.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.253
You lying-ass bitch!

20:04.412 --> 20:06.881
She's mad because I slept with Randy.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.009
To get food for my fellow hostages.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.637
So, uh, you really think you can
fix it so I just get probation?

20:13.796 --> 20:15.389
Oh, God, no, I just said that.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.644
All these drugs and weapons,
attempted murder of police officers.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.271
You'll probably die in prison.
Oh.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.649
Will you come visit me?

20:24.807 --> 20:27.310
Probably not.
Because you're a spy and all?

20:27.476 --> 20:29.774
Um...
He's a highly trained secret agent.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.656
Is that right? Well, listen here.

20:32.815 --> 20:38.072
If you ever find your way back up
in the holler, give me a call.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.868
I think I got myself a extra pair of Capezios
lying around somewheres.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.081
Uh, okay.

20:45.244 --> 20:49.249
Should I, just-- Just 911?
All right, let's move them out!

20:49.415 --> 20:53.386
Well, that's just great.
Everybody gets laid in the holler but me.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.714
Well, and you, I guess.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.883
Since they ate your husband.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.138
Dan Lather. Ha, ha, ha.
