WEBVTT

00:00.024 --> 00:02.441
J's got a job. I checked
it out. It's solid.

00:02.907 --> 00:03.988
It's a pill mill.

00:04.144 --> 00:06.206
The Codys ripped it off,
and we helped them do it.

00:07.076 --> 00:10.077
Nice play, boys. Nice play.

00:10.659 --> 00:12.884
Why can't I go back to my old school?

00:13.124 --> 00:14.858
You picked this one, remember?

00:14.860 --> 00:16.559
But what if I picked wrong?

00:17.165 --> 00:18.896
That girl you have at the house,

00:18.898 --> 00:20.505
she's got juvie written all over her.

00:20.530 --> 00:21.966
I hooked up with her at a party.

00:22.279 --> 00:23.644
But you can't tell Nicky.

00:23.644 --> 00:25.143
What's the deal with you and J?

00:25.144 --> 00:26.477
What do you think?

00:26.753 --> 00:29.061
Hey. How's it going?

00:29.215 --> 00:31.248
I had sex with someone last night.

00:32.418 --> 00:33.817
Who the hell is this?

00:33.819 --> 00:34.824
Hey!

00:34.849 --> 00:36.081
- Put your hands up and get out!
- All right, hey!

00:37.623 --> 00:38.819
Do I know you?

00:39.158 --> 00:40.125
Yeah, it's Billy.

00:40.783 --> 00:41.925
That's your father.

00:41.927 --> 00:43.193
What do you remember about him?

00:43.298 --> 00:44.802
I remember he's an asshole,

00:44.827 --> 00:46.572
and I remember Smurf kicking him out.

00:46.783 --> 00:47.911
My father,

00:47.911 --> 00:49.633
who I've never met before in my life,

00:49.635 --> 00:50.968
showed up and wants to hang.

00:50.970 --> 00:52.269
Just out of nowhere?

00:52.271 --> 00:53.542
You want to get drunk with me?

00:54.273 --> 00:55.773
Billy is in our house?

00:57.108 --> 00:58.473
Get him out, J.

00:58.644 --> 01:00.344
Get... him... out.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.009
Still here, huh?

02:13.019 --> 02:14.536
Craig said they could stay.

02:16.322 --> 02:17.406
All done.

02:18.390 --> 02:19.688
Go wait in the car.

02:20.126 --> 02:21.692
I don't wanna go to school.

02:21.694 --> 02:23.193
Oh, you're going to school.

02:32.905 --> 02:34.805
Do I need to move back in here?

02:35.480 --> 02:36.774
No, I've got it covered.

02:36.776 --> 02:37.920
No, you don't.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.202
Is the coffee on?

02:53.359 --> 02:54.390
Hey.

02:55.895 --> 02:56.938
Hey.

02:57.474 --> 02:58.698
Those my shorts?

02:59.605 --> 03:00.664
Oh, yeah.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.175
No, I found these on the dryer.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.433
Didn't think anybody would mind.

03:04.097 --> 03:05.245
Well, I mind.

03:07.619 --> 03:08.629
All right.

03:10.609 --> 03:11.836
No big deal.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.428
What're you doing here, Billy?

03:24.690 --> 03:26.023
Well, Smurf's in jail,

03:26.025 --> 03:27.958
and I thought it'd be a good time for me

03:27.960 --> 03:29.372
to catch up with Deran a bit.

03:29.428 --> 03:31.412
You know, she never wanted
me anywhere near him.

03:31.482 --> 03:32.855
Bullshit. That's a...

03:32.856 --> 03:34.808
That car in the driveway is stolen.

03:36.347 --> 03:37.501
What, are you on the run?

03:41.240 --> 03:42.868
I'm just here for Deran, dude.

03:42.868 --> 03:44.578
Yeah, well, Deran hates you.

03:45.677 --> 03:46.780
He hates you.

03:47.848 --> 03:49.355
Well, we shall see.

03:52.718 --> 03:54.376
You know the best thing about a pool,
Pope?

03:57.256 --> 03:58.455
Don't have to take a shower.

04:52.244 --> 04:53.335
If...

04:54.333 --> 04:56.119
that's how sex is gonna be,

04:57.377 --> 04:58.682
I'm gonna need you to take it

04:58.684 --> 05:00.050
a little bit easier
on my right shoulder.

05:01.513 --> 05:02.871
That scar is hot.

05:03.702 --> 05:06.356
X Games exhibition, Mexico City.

05:13.431 --> 05:14.898
How many surgeries have you had?

05:16.912 --> 05:20.103
26, 27?

05:20.444 --> 05:21.451
Jesus.

05:21.573 --> 05:22.822
Broken arms.

05:23.049 --> 05:24.675
Couple of vertebral fractures.

05:24.946 --> 05:26.762
Got a rod in my right femur.

05:27.112 --> 05:30.014
That scar's from a scapular fracture.

05:31.884 --> 05:32.889
This you?

05:33.505 --> 05:34.531
Yeah.

05:36.635 --> 05:37.985
You look good.

05:38.958 --> 05:40.283
This is a great picture.

05:41.746 --> 05:42.856
Thanks.

05:43.712 --> 05:44.985
A friend of mine took it.

05:46.185 --> 05:47.256
You hungry?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.264
You wanna get food or something?

05:51.209 --> 05:54.944
Like, uh, go out somewhere?

05:58.159 --> 05:59.384
Yeah, I guess.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.277
Don's or something.

06:02.748 --> 06:03.819
Um...

06:05.150 --> 06:06.669
I kind of got a lot of shit to do.

06:13.158 --> 06:16.296
Yeah, I should, uh, get going anyway.

06:37.464 --> 06:38.608
Morning.

06:50.322 --> 06:51.491
I'm sorry.

06:53.050 --> 06:55.786
I mean, I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry and I'm not.

07:01.475 --> 07:03.073
Will you talk to me, please?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.976
Yeah, I-I was pissed.

07:05.978 --> 07:07.177
You're, like, never around.

07:07.179 --> 07:08.499
And this guy was just there.

07:08.524 --> 07:10.424
So, I, like, did it to make you mad.

07:11.884 --> 07:12.883
But now, you've, like...

07:12.885 --> 07:14.317
You've got this girl
living in the house,

07:14.319 --> 07:16.138
and I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

07:17.650 --> 07:19.055
I mean, I feel shitty.

07:19.718 --> 07:20.757
Don't you?

07:23.773 --> 07:27.066
I mean, what are we to each other?

07:29.501 --> 07:30.995
I g... I got to go to work.

07:33.839 --> 07:35.481
Are you sleeping with Mia?

08:04.611 --> 08:05.891
Whoo!

08:09.396 --> 08:10.507
That's good.

08:58.688 --> 08:59.837
What's up, Arnie?

08:59.992 --> 09:01.191
That was a nice set, man.

09:01.193 --> 09:02.792
Aw, thanks a lot, man.
I had a good time.

09:02.794 --> 09:03.830
Yeah, yeah.

09:04.402 --> 09:05.628
Yeah, he did okay.

09:05.735 --> 09:08.654
What's with your nephew saying you
won't sponsor SoCal Grom this year?

09:08.934 --> 09:10.200
What, the surf competition?

09:10.468 --> 09:12.206
I went to your mom's
house to get the check.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.638
The kid said with Smurf
in jail, it's his decision.

09:15.841 --> 09:18.357
Really, man. I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:20.045 --> 09:22.412
Smurf's been sponsoring
SoCal Grom for years.

09:25.761 --> 09:27.146
Yeah, I didn't know that.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.081
5K a year's a small price to pay,
asshole.

09:35.808 --> 09:36.807
Next.

09:36.832 --> 09:38.433
Hi. Can I get a money order, please?

09:38.509 --> 09:40.456
- For how much?
- $2,400.

11:12.492 --> 11:14.259
Laundering money right under our noses

11:14.284 --> 11:15.883
like we're assholes.

11:16.825 --> 11:18.468
Let's go make some new friends.

11:18.738 --> 11:20.115
Let's do it.

12:23.703 --> 12:24.849
Hey.

12:25.741 --> 12:26.763
Nicky?

12:29.588 --> 12:30.753
You okay?

12:47.327 --> 12:50.108
This isn't how I pictured any of this.

13:24.424 --> 13:25.552
Where're you headed?

13:26.360 --> 13:27.438
Just work.

13:29.630 --> 13:30.896
I can give you a ride.

13:30.898 --> 13:33.231
Oh. I'm good, but thank you.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.233
Nah, I'm not asking.

13:40.540 --> 13:41.641
Come on.

13:48.682 --> 13:49.714
Uh, we're closed.

13:49.716 --> 13:51.466
I don't open for another 20 minutes.

13:51.852 --> 13:53.214
Looking for Deran Cody.

13:54.725 --> 13:55.760
Who are you?

13:56.415 --> 13:57.489
Are you Mr. Cody?

13:58.344 --> 13:59.628
Uh, it depends. What do you want?

13:59.628 --> 14:00.745
I'm Jeff Stewart,

14:00.745 --> 14:02.661
California Employment
Development Department.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.967
Did you employ a Jose Robles?

14:09.614 --> 14:10.636
Shit.

14:10.637 --> 14:12.478
Mr. Robles filed an unemployment claim,

14:12.503 --> 14:14.036
but there's no record of your bar

14:14.061 --> 14:15.340
paying unemployment insurance.

14:15.342 --> 14:16.378
Yeah.

14:17.177 --> 14:18.698
He stole shit from the kitchen.

14:19.057 --> 14:20.812
He was taking steaks out of the freezer.

14:21.078 --> 14:22.438
Doesn't matter why you let him go.

14:22.983 --> 14:24.093
You still owe the state.

14:24.732 --> 14:25.917
I have a brochure here

14:25.919 --> 14:27.335
that explains what you need to do.

14:27.439 --> 14:29.118
- Okay.
- How long you been the owner?

14:29.708 --> 14:30.931
A few months.

14:30.956 --> 14:32.791
We'll have to calculate
your back payments.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.166
There'll be a penalty,

14:34.191 --> 14:35.749
but, uh, we can put you
on a payment plan.

14:37.374 --> 14:38.408
I didn't know...

14:38.698 --> 14:41.198
You own a business, you
have responsibilities.

14:41.478 --> 14:43.278
- You have an accountant?
- No.

14:43.514 --> 14:44.961
Well, you should.

14:49.653 --> 14:50.751
So who are you?

14:52.289 --> 14:53.426
I'm a friend of J's.

14:57.203 --> 14:59.064
No, you're not a friend of J's.

15:03.709 --> 15:05.382
I just needed somewhere to crash.

15:08.686 --> 15:10.319
It's gonna be the auto
body shop on the left.

15:18.595 --> 15:19.834
Thanks for the ride, man.

15:22.466 --> 15:24.445
Find someplace else to crash.

15:27.671 --> 15:29.064
I gotta get to work.

15:50.055 --> 15:51.116
J?!

15:51.720 --> 15:52.946
Yo, J!

15:53.430 --> 15:54.896
He left earlier, man.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.116
Kid's always on the move.

15:58.302 --> 16:00.865
- Needs to chillax, if you ask me.
- Mm-hmm.

16:01.038 --> 16:02.170
What do you need him for?

16:02.172 --> 16:04.395
Boy's messed up, and I gotta fix it.

16:06.577 --> 16:07.881
What's she searching for?

16:08.582 --> 16:11.061
Uh, she's into all that foraging shit.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.114
Anything I can do to help you?

16:15.114 --> 16:16.580
Yeah. You got 5 grand?

16:17.006 --> 16:18.142
No.

16:18.887 --> 16:20.727
J's got 5 grand to give to you?

16:21.172 --> 16:23.338
Smurf sponsors this a surf contest

16:23.340 --> 16:24.519
for kids that can't afford boards

16:24.519 --> 16:26.027
- and all that kind of shit.
- Yeah?

16:26.527 --> 16:28.353
And J's pulled out of
it and didn't tell me.

16:29.066 --> 16:30.399
So tell Smurf.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.228
No, I don't really go out there, man.

16:32.837 --> 16:34.314
You don't visit her in jail?

16:34.502 --> 16:35.407
No.

16:38.239 --> 16:39.972
Even I know that's a big mistake.

16:39.972 --> 16:41.038
Holy shit.

16:52.351 --> 16:53.808
What do you want, Pearce?

16:55.103 --> 16:56.440
Have a seat, Janine.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.335
I'll stand.

17:01.738 --> 17:03.506
So, you left J in charge, huh?

17:04.961 --> 17:07.142
Boy, that's a lot of responsibility

17:07.144 --> 17:08.337
for a boy his age.

17:08.845 --> 17:11.279
And all those money orders
he has to buy.

17:12.402 --> 17:15.317
You know,
I can't imagine why a kid his age

17:15.319 --> 17:17.883
would be buying dozens of money orders.

17:19.111 --> 17:20.175
Hey, my kid,

17:20.290 --> 17:21.990
he's Apple Pay this, Venmo that.

17:21.992 --> 17:24.852
But J. He's... He's old school.

17:38.872 --> 17:39.874
J?

17:40.062 --> 17:41.136
Yeah?

17:41.678 --> 17:43.027
What's all this shit?

17:43.447 --> 17:44.629
It's the rents.

17:48.352 --> 17:49.584
Hey, you, uh...

17:49.586 --> 17:51.319
- You do all the payroll for us, right?
- Yeah.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.621
Yeah, I'll get you your paychecks

17:52.623 --> 17:53.855
as soon as I'm done with this.

17:55.559 --> 17:58.460
Uh, I got a little problem with my bar.

17:58.462 --> 18:00.028
I, uh, pay everybody in cash,

18:00.030 --> 18:02.464
but some asshole decided
to file for unemployment.

18:02.466 --> 18:05.467
Now the state's kind of
coming down on me, so...

18:06.670 --> 18:08.803
You haven't been paying
your unemployment insurance?

18:09.389 --> 18:10.872
I got... I keep records.

18:10.874 --> 18:12.540
It's just that the taxes and shit,

18:12.542 --> 18:13.769
it just takes too much time.

18:13.794 --> 18:14.909
I mean, I pay mine.

18:14.911 --> 18:16.344
Aren't they supposed to pay theirs?

18:16.346 --> 18:17.606
<i>We</i> pay yours.

18:18.548 --> 18:20.095
You get a W2 from Smurf.

18:20.441 --> 18:21.416
A what?

18:21.724 --> 18:23.643
For your federal income taxes.

18:26.365 --> 18:28.011
Does Smurf do that for you, too?

18:28.646 --> 18:29.787
I don't know, man.

18:31.342 --> 18:34.222
So, you need help with your payroll?

18:35.443 --> 18:36.765
Yeah.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.093
Hold on one sec.

18:40.137 --> 18:41.169
Hello?

18:41.171 --> 18:42.504
<i> You have a call from</i>

18:42.506 --> 18:45.038
<i>an inmate at San Marco
Detention Facility.</i>

18:45.038 --> 18:46.402
<i> Janine Cody.</i>

18:46.427 --> 18:47.885
<i>- Do you accept?</i>
- Uh, yeah.

18:49.107 --> 18:50.643
<i> J, baby,</i>

18:50.956 --> 18:53.253
<i>can you come visit your
grandmother, please?</i>

18:54.916 --> 18:56.318
Uh, now's not the best time.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.919
<i>Just get here. Today.</i>

19:09.666 --> 19:11.433
<i>This is Lieutenant Commander Belmont.</i>

19:11.435 --> 19:12.667
<i>Leave a message.</i>

19:14.104 --> 19:17.373
H-Hey, Dad, it's, uh... it's me.

19:18.108 --> 19:19.293
I, um...

19:21.044 --> 19:23.866
I want to come to Guam.

19:23.866 --> 19:24.958
I, uh...

19:25.540 --> 19:29.224
I want to see you and Jack and

19:29.909 --> 19:31.336
L... um, Lydia.

19:31.361 --> 19:32.444
And, um...

19:34.382 --> 19:36.087
Yeah, I just wanna come...

19:38.119 --> 19:39.236
home.

19:42.519 --> 19:45.776
So, um, uh, yeah.

19:45.776 --> 19:47.401
Okay, bye.

20:15.607 --> 20:16.738
<i>Hey, Smurf.</i>

20:18.191 --> 20:19.959
<i>I thought you'd come sooner.</i>

20:21.853 --> 20:22.919
<i>I know.</i>

20:24.688 --> 20:26.081
<i>Did J send you?</i>

20:27.590 --> 20:28.772
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

20:29.286 --> 20:31.787
- <i>Yeah, But where's J? Isn't J coming?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

20:32.541 --> 20:33.912
I mean, maybe. I don't know.

20:34.799 --> 20:36.018
I don't follow him around.

20:38.039 --> 20:39.861
<i>Is Billy still at the house?</i>

20:43.057 --> 20:44.376
<i>Him and Deran, uh...</i>

20:45.285 --> 20:46.785
<i>they're kinda hitting it off.</i>

20:50.757 --> 20:52.385
<i>Hey, so, um...</i>

20:54.630 --> 20:57.552
<i>you've been giving Carter money</i>

20:58.743 --> 21:00.454
<i>for that little kid surf contest?</i>

21:01.727 --> 21:02.764
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:02.764 --> 21:04.015
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Every year.</i>

21:04.807 --> 21:05.854
<i>I have to.</i>

21:07.206 --> 21:08.378
<i>You ran away.</i>

21:11.098 --> 21:12.264
<i>I couldn't stay.</i>

21:13.165 --> 21:14.244
<i>I was high.</i>

21:15.251 --> 21:16.395
<i>Carter stayed.</i>

21:16.795 --> 21:18.208
<i>Well, it was his car.</i>

21:18.647 --> 21:19.674
<i>And his brother.</i>

21:20.117 --> 21:21.744
<i>But they weren't his drugs.</i>

21:22.652 --> 21:24.545
<i>And he wasn't driving.</i>

21:26.296 --> 21:27.370
You were.

21:30.193 --> 21:31.248
<i>You didn't tell me.</i>

21:31.273 --> 21:32.399
<i>Tell you what?</i>

21:32.863 --> 21:35.463
<i>That I give some guy a
couple of grand a year</i>

21:35.465 --> 21:36.800
<i>to make him happy?</i>

21:36.952 --> 21:38.158
<i>You should've told me.</i>

21:38.902 --> 21:41.150
<i>I looked like an asshole.</i>

21:42.139 --> 21:43.992
Carter's brother's operation

21:44.032 --> 21:46.882
cost $100,000.

21:47.411 --> 21:49.744
He was in physical therapy
for two years.

21:49.746 --> 21:51.376
You didn't know that, either.

21:58.008 --> 22:00.148
<i>How long do you got to
keep paying him for?</i>

22:01.925 --> 22:03.458
<i>Can his brother walk?</i>

22:10.469 --> 22:11.623
So...

22:12.398 --> 22:14.855
We pay until he can.

22:19.525 --> 22:21.176
We take care of our people.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.302
J said he wouldn't pay
for the surf contest.

22:27.551 --> 22:28.706
<i>He will.</i>

22:29.386 --> 22:30.819
He told Carter he wouldn't...

22:30.821 --> 22:32.281
I said, he will.

22:36.059 --> 22:37.942
<i>Why did you put J in charge?</i>

22:42.199 --> 22:44.499
<i>What makes you think J's in charge?</i>

23:09.604 --> 23:10.683
So...

23:11.929 --> 23:14.576
shit's kinda falling apart
now that I'm not around.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.634
Isn't it?

23:18.379 --> 23:19.608
Okay, pay attention.

23:21.015 --> 23:23.749
<i>I need you to give Craig $5,000.</i>

23:23.751 --> 23:26.024
- <i>We haven't got five...</i>
- Don't talk.

23:27.503 --> 23:28.786
Just listen.

23:30.432 --> 23:33.087
<i>Give Craig $5,000.</i>

23:33.594 --> 23:36.355
<i>Get that prick, Billy,</i>

23:36.655 --> 23:38.564
<i>out of my house now.</i>

23:40.835 --> 23:44.371
And you, my friend, you need to be

23:44.396 --> 23:47.230
<i>much more aware of your surroundings</i>

23:47.231 --> 23:49.323
<i>when you're collecting the rents.</i>

23:49.736 --> 23:50.758
<i>What?</i>

23:50.965 --> 23:52.999
Our friend is watching you.

23:55.011 --> 23:56.271
<i>I was careful.</i>

23:56.273 --> 23:57.918
<i>Not careful enough.</i>

24:01.702 --> 24:02.978
<i>I want you to make sure</i>

24:02.980 --> 24:05.970
<i>that every tenant remembers
their rental agreement.</i>

24:06.737 --> 24:07.783
<i>Fine.</i>

24:07.785 --> 24:11.436
<i>Everything else is less important.</i>

24:12.009 --> 24:13.321
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

24:14.258 --> 24:15.448
<i>I got it.</i>

24:33.077 --> 24:34.709
Hey. The mummy rises.

24:35.635 --> 24:37.047
What's up, dude?

24:37.481 --> 24:38.413
Don't worry,

24:38.415 --> 24:39.948
I'm gonna pay my tab. I promise.

24:43.454 --> 24:44.986
So, you, uh, renovated this place

24:44.988 --> 24:46.254
and opened it on your own.

24:46.256 --> 24:47.902
Pretty impressive.

24:53.130 --> 24:54.381
I just wanna talk.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.192
Okay.

25:02.051 --> 25:03.572
I get it. I know how you feel.

25:03.574 --> 25:05.406
I mean, I had a shitty dad, you know?

25:06.743 --> 25:09.595
He was a metal worker up in Escondido,

25:10.091 --> 25:11.214
and he wasn't around a lot.

25:11.214 --> 25:12.494
But, dude, when he was around,

25:14.185 --> 25:15.422
it was bad.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.892
It was really bad.

25:19.515 --> 25:20.826
When I was, like, 16,

25:20.858 --> 25:22.740
I just left and started
sleeping on the beach.

25:23.092 --> 25:25.292
And that's where I was 10 years later

25:25.294 --> 25:26.525
when I met your mom.

25:28.008 --> 25:30.270
And, dude, she changed my life.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.365
She really did.

25:31.367 --> 25:34.101
She was unbelievable, man.

25:34.103 --> 25:35.936
I... I never met anybody like her.

25:35.938 --> 25:38.205
She was, like, one minute,
she'd be quiet,

25:38.207 --> 25:39.340
and the next minute,

25:39.342 --> 25:41.876
she'd be running down
the beach naked, you know?

25:42.810 --> 25:44.554
Great body, great tits,

25:45.798 --> 25:47.015
just... Sorry.

25:48.212 --> 25:49.711
But she also had three kids already.

25:49.711 --> 25:52.312
So, Pope and Julia were like 7 or 8.

25:52.314 --> 25:53.813
Craig was in diapers.

25:55.013 --> 25:57.177
I never actually changed
a diaper till Craig.

25:57.269 --> 25:58.581
Let me tell you something.

25:59.087 --> 26:01.387
Craig shit himself a lot.

26:03.124 --> 26:05.158
Pope and I, man, I just never
hit it off with that kid.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.369
I think he was...

26:06.557 --> 26:08.757
He was, like, too old
when I showed up, you know?

26:09.811 --> 26:11.307
Julia was cool, though.

26:12.043 --> 26:13.643
She taught me how to boost Sudafed.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.955
Smurf taught me how to hot-wire a car.

26:17.980 --> 26:19.079
Do you know that?

26:19.103 --> 26:20.494
Yeah, she taught me, too.

26:23.542 --> 26:25.294
Yeah, man, I got to tell you,

26:25.902 --> 26:27.009
I dug her.

26:27.011 --> 26:28.630
I really dug her.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.146
And she was right to kick me out, man.

26:31.148 --> 26:33.627
If I was dragging you around
with me when you were a kid,

26:34.018 --> 26:35.984
you sure as shit wouldn't have ended up

26:35.986 --> 26:38.320
as the productive member
of society you are now.

26:39.145 --> 26:40.422
And the truth is,

26:40.535 --> 26:43.938
I always wanted her way
more than she wanted me.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.528
So, when you were born,
she got rid of me,

26:46.530 --> 26:48.071
like, right off the bat.

26:48.766 --> 26:50.401
And I missed her like crazy.

26:51.966 --> 26:53.137
I really did.

26:54.972 --> 26:56.555
Date lots of chicks, man.

26:59.641 --> 27:00.843
I'm gay.

27:03.921 --> 27:05.226
Then lots of dudes.

27:06.216 --> 27:07.554
Date lots of dudes, man.

27:07.685 --> 27:09.465
Enjoy the ride, but be you.

27:10.583 --> 27:12.020
Ride lots of guys.

27:12.022 --> 27:13.978
Give rides to lots of guys.

27:15.025 --> 27:16.725
I-I-I don't know, uh,

27:17.048 --> 27:19.622
the tops and bottoms thing, but...

27:20.805 --> 27:22.798
I'm guessing I'm, like, a hetero bottom.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.982
'Cause I like to be told what to do.

27:26.337 --> 27:28.469
Or maybe I'm just lazy
as shit, I don't know.

27:29.173 --> 27:32.786
But there was this one guy one time.

27:32.811 --> 27:34.174
- We were on the beach...
- I get it.

27:34.199 --> 27:36.278
You're... You're a free-spirited guy.

27:36.670 --> 27:37.730
That's cool.

27:38.929 --> 27:40.411
Yeah, yeah, but you know what, dude.

27:40.411 --> 27:42.880
Like,
I could never get my shit together.

27:42.905 --> 27:44.372
I mean, not like you, man.

27:44.374 --> 27:45.585
You get shit done.

27:45.610 --> 27:46.548
Right?

27:46.548 --> 27:48.718
That's why I don't really understand,

27:48.718 --> 27:51.719
why is J in charge
while Smurf's in prison?

27:51.721 --> 27:52.920
That doesn't make any sense to me.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.088
It's bullshit.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.422
You should be in charge.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.001
I already paid rent this month.

28:06.001 --> 28:07.267
No, I'm not here for that.

28:08.140 --> 28:09.219
Then what?

28:10.205 --> 28:12.238
You know what to say if
somebody else asks you

28:12.240 --> 28:13.740
how much you pay in rent, right?

28:13.742 --> 28:15.263
This some sort of test?

28:15.263 --> 28:16.462
No. No, no, no.

28:16.464 --> 28:17.797
I just need to make sure
you got your story straight.

28:18.954 --> 28:20.436
$2,300.

28:22.203 --> 28:23.665
Did I pass?

28:24.711 --> 28:25.805
Thank you.

28:54.522 --> 28:55.625
Hey, Dad.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.592
<i>Nicky, What's going on?</i>

28:58.303 --> 29:01.138
Um,
things just aren't really working out.

29:01.753 --> 29:03.168
<i>Did you break up with J?</i>

29:04.899 --> 29:05.945
No, but...

29:05.947 --> 29:09.382
<i>Okay. Well, what about a job?</i>

29:09.384 --> 29:10.672
<i>Did you ever find a job?</i>

29:11.511 --> 29:12.540
Not yet.

29:13.046 --> 29:14.148
<i>Work would help.</i>

29:14.965 --> 29:17.525
<i>I'm sure. Or school?</i>

29:17.810 --> 29:19.503
You thinking about going back to school?

29:19.578 --> 29:22.056
I just... I just want to come home, Dad.

29:22.381 --> 29:24.782
<i>Again, the Pacific Starlight northbound</i>

29:24.784 --> 29:26.169
<i>will be arriving at platform 2.</i>

29:26.194 --> 29:28.849
<i>Our place here is... tight.</i>

29:30.189 --> 29:31.790
<i>And Jack, I mean, he's
finally comfortable</i>

29:31.790 --> 29:33.073
<i>being an only child.</i>

29:33.402 --> 29:35.091
You don't want me to come?

29:37.066 --> 29:39.384
<i>It's not that we don't
want you. It's just...</i>

29:40.365 --> 29:42.135
<i>Maybe you should come
over for Christmas.</i>

29:44.388 --> 29:46.794
Which Cody boy is your dad?

29:47.869 --> 29:49.561
Um, Julia was my mom.

29:50.317 --> 29:51.995
Oh, Julia.

29:52.974 --> 29:55.053
Smurf said never give her money.

29:55.568 --> 29:56.853
But I always do.

29:57.345 --> 30:00.933
A couple of dollars
for ice cream or soda.

30:02.678 --> 30:03.950
How is she?

30:05.954 --> 30:08.381
Um, Mrs. Fullerton, if anyone asks,

30:08.406 --> 30:09.571
you know to say

30:09.571 --> 30:11.561
that you pay $2,600 a month in rent.

30:11.834 --> 30:12.966
Remember that, right?

30:14.576 --> 30:17.611
I've paid $175 a month for years.

30:17.613 --> 30:19.776
- That's not gonna change.
- No, no. Of course.

30:19.776 --> 30:22.818
But you remember to <i>
say</i> that you pay $2,600.

30:22.979 --> 30:24.059
Correct?

30:24.059 --> 30:26.998
Uh, times have changed, haven't they?

30:28.426 --> 30:30.860
You used to get a whole
house for that much.

30:31.128 --> 30:32.423
Mm. Mwah.

30:34.854 --> 30:36.287
So... So, we're clear?

30:36.565 --> 30:37.831
You know what to say?

30:40.102 --> 30:41.672
Sure thing, honey.

30:44.496 --> 30:45.906
Okay. Good.

30:45.908 --> 30:47.474
Anyway, uh, thank you for the tea.

30:47.476 --> 30:48.920
I should... I should get going.

30:48.942 --> 30:50.855
Oh, she keeps you busy, doesn't she?

30:50.880 --> 30:51.979
Yes, she sure does.

30:52.004 --> 30:54.310
Always running here and there.

30:55.197 --> 30:56.569
So, how much do you pay in rent?

30:58.207 --> 31:01.167
$175 every month,

31:02.016 --> 31:03.318
on the first.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.018
First window.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.080
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

31:33.232 --> 31:35.583
<i>Are you looking
after my mom in here?</i>

31:38.573 --> 31:39.987
<i>So you're a Cody?</i>

31:42.041 --> 31:43.625
<i>You getting paid on time?</i>

31:44.173 --> 31:45.384
Mm-hmm.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.872
<i>Then why did you move the girl in?</i>

31:52.027 --> 31:53.242
<i>The girl.</i>

31:53.863 --> 31:54.903
<i>Mia.</i>

31:58.631 --> 32:00.537
<i>That bitch doesn't work for me.</i>

32:02.087 --> 32:03.908
She's squatting at our house.

32:04.808 --> 32:07.463
<i>She does whatever she wants,
whenever she wants.</i>

32:08.524 --> 32:10.675
<i>I didn't know she was
living at your mom's place.</i>

32:10.675 --> 32:12.253
<i>Get her out.</i>

32:14.083 --> 32:15.685
<i>I didn't put her in there.</i>

32:16.958 --> 32:18.340
<i>But if she is there,</i>

32:19.818 --> 32:21.236
<i>you best watch out.</i>

32:21.290 --> 32:22.590
<i>That</i> chica's <i> dangerous.</i>

33:05.776 --> 33:07.014
Yo. Deran.

33:07.039 --> 33:08.194
I need to talk to you, man.

33:10.344 --> 33:12.063
I don't have any of my
paperwork or anything.

33:12.088 --> 33:13.321
No, it's not about that.

33:16.118 --> 33:17.150
Right.

33:17.825 --> 33:19.258
I'll head back to the house.

33:19.477 --> 33:20.534
See you later.

33:22.932 --> 33:24.031
What's up?

33:24.033 --> 33:26.104
Yeah, we got... We got a problem, man.

33:26.502 --> 33:27.698
Outside.

33:45.992 --> 33:47.272
Hey, Mrs. F.

33:47.683 --> 33:50.417
Gray Cat hates riding in cars.

33:50.442 --> 33:51.573
Hmm.

33:55.398 --> 33:57.464
She's got like dementia or something.

33:57.466 --> 33:58.551
I don't know.

33:59.869 --> 34:02.041
- And the car?
- It's hers.

34:02.066 --> 34:04.271
It was easier to lose my
tail if I took her car.

34:04.273 --> 34:05.839
Also, I think it's better

34:05.841 --> 34:07.146
if the car's gone, too, right?

34:07.898 --> 34:09.079
What do you mean "gone"?

34:09.103 --> 34:10.803
Well, I-I don't know what we do

34:10.828 --> 34:11.998
in situations like this?

34:11.998 --> 34:13.190
Situations like what?

34:13.190 --> 34:15.358
If the cops ask her
questions about the rent,

34:15.360 --> 34:16.559
we're screwed.

34:21.568 --> 34:23.592
Okay. What do you want to
do? You wanna shoot her?

34:35.525 --> 34:36.636
J around?

34:37.329 --> 34:39.313
You're always looking for that boy.

34:40.766 --> 34:42.199
He was here a minute ago.

34:42.201 --> 34:43.472
I think he split.

34:50.675 --> 34:53.763
So nice here. All the trees.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.364
I feel like I can breathe.

35:01.483 --> 35:03.894
Trees are the lungs of the world,
you know?

35:07.123 --> 35:08.335
Yeah, I guess.

35:10.782 --> 35:11.914
You want this back?

35:12.355 --> 35:13.678
It's all yours.

35:42.947 --> 35:45.448
We care about Lena's well-being.

35:45.450 --> 35:47.569
But we need to get to the
root of this aggression.

35:48.070 --> 35:49.599
I spoke to Clarissa's parents.

35:49.624 --> 35:50.967
They're not gonna press charges.

35:50.967 --> 35:52.445
But I think we can both agree

35:52.445 --> 35:54.318
that this isn't acceptable behavior.

35:54.862 --> 35:58.016
This... It's not like her.

35:58.229 --> 36:01.697
She just... She just
lost both of her parents.

36:01.882 --> 36:04.100
What kind of grief
counseling is she receiving?

36:05.910 --> 36:07.336
She should be talking to someone.

36:07.338 --> 36:08.370
It would help.

36:10.183 --> 36:11.556
She doesn't need a shrink.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.430
To be quite frank,

36:14.826 --> 36:15.978
I think she does.

36:22.985 --> 36:24.615
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

36:26.617 --> 36:27.957
You cut her hair?!

36:28.195 --> 36:29.404
It's just me.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.960
I'm... I'm all by myself.

36:30.962 --> 36:32.361
I can't do this by myself.

36:32.363 --> 36:34.463
I need... I need your help.

36:34.465 --> 36:36.265
Because I don't know what to do!

36:36.267 --> 36:37.766
I need you to help me!

36:37.768 --> 36:39.690
You gotta... You gotta act right!

36:39.715 --> 36:41.184
You can't make shit worse!

36:41.439 --> 36:44.173
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get you in here?

36:44.973 --> 36:46.742
I don't wanna be here.

36:46.767 --> 36:47.941
You do.

36:48.246 --> 36:49.578
Yes, you do.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.517
I'm sorry.

37:01.331 --> 37:02.591
So, I've counted out

37:02.593 --> 37:04.193
all the hours I've paid out, right?

37:04.195 --> 37:05.327
Been open for five months,

37:05.329 --> 37:06.762
I got four full-time employees

37:06.764 --> 37:08.664
- at minimum wage...
- Where're we going?

37:08.911 --> 37:10.136
Including tips.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.227
Kai's been great with tips.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.361
I don't have to pay shit on tips, right?

37:12.363 --> 37:13.696
Deran, where are we going?

37:15.980 --> 37:17.508
Where do you live, Mrs. Fullerton?

37:19.347 --> 37:22.004
I didn't marry Harold Fullerton.

37:24.119 --> 37:25.475
Well, he asked and asked.

37:26.955 --> 37:28.254
But I said no.

37:29.357 --> 37:30.899
Stood my ground.

37:32.215 --> 37:34.515
Okay, but you still
live in Cleveland, right?

37:34.793 --> 37:36.115
Not Cleveland.

37:36.699 --> 37:38.023
Collingdale,

37:39.475 --> 37:40.728
born and reared.

37:42.018 --> 37:45.917
Lived on the corner of
North and Morningside

37:46.446 --> 37:47.996
since I was 21.

37:48.820 --> 37:50.735
Nine years now.

37:53.006 --> 37:54.536
Okay, so, Collingdale?

37:56.282 --> 37:57.874
Y-Yeah, that's right.

38:10.873 --> 38:11.936
Hey.

38:16.766 --> 38:17.830
Um...

38:22.641 --> 38:24.132
Took me a second to get it.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.643
Must be strange without Smurf
around to take care of you.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.013
You know, I'm really
glad we do this, Carter.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.456
I just didn't know.

38:37.078 --> 38:40.014
And, uh, your brother
looks great out there, man.

38:42.042 --> 38:43.834
Just pay the goddamn money on time.

38:54.931 --> 38:57.181
All right, we're here.

38:57.924 --> 38:59.062
You hungry?

38:59.766 --> 39:01.069
I could eat.

39:01.434 --> 39:02.712
Yeah? Okay.

39:07.409 --> 39:08.718
Get her carrier thing.

39:10.009 --> 39:11.664
And her I.D. out of her purse.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.104
Okay, Mrs. Fullerton,
you want to step out?

39:18.626 --> 39:20.259
I'll help you out here.

39:20.261 --> 39:21.857
Watch your head getting up.

39:23.358 --> 39:24.806
Take this step here.

39:25.066 --> 39:26.198
There we go.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.067
We're gonna go over to
this bench over here.

39:28.069 --> 39:29.969
Make sure there isn't anything in there.

39:29.971 --> 39:32.673
Okay, you want to plop down right here?

39:33.975 --> 39:35.221
Okay.

39:36.509 --> 39:37.705
Can I get you anything?

39:37.730 --> 39:39.445
You want a milkshake or something?

39:40.487 --> 39:42.463
Yeah? Okay. Great.

39:42.917 --> 39:45.882
Let's get it going. Take
that collar off this.

39:46.053 --> 39:48.760
I can get a new one of these.
There. Okay.

39:48.980 --> 39:51.335
We'll see you in a little bit. Yeah?

39:51.836 --> 39:53.002
All right.

39:58.699 --> 40:00.289
You really getting her something to eat?

40:00.446 --> 40:01.478
No.

42:06.922 --> 42:08.087
Hot date?

42:08.090 --> 42:09.912
Yeah.

42:10.272 --> 42:12.405
The kid thought I was gonna
put a bullet in her head.

42:21.514 --> 42:25.099
- What up, pal?
- Not much. Pretty busy.

42:25.505 --> 42:26.770
I can see that.

42:28.227 --> 42:29.406
Where you been?

42:30.364 --> 42:31.568
I was running an errand.

42:32.247 --> 42:33.780
Don't lie to me again.

42:33.782 --> 42:35.698
I'm not lying to you.
I was running an errand.

42:42.049 --> 42:44.082
I don't want Smurf to die in jail.

42:44.084 --> 42:45.117
You should know that.

42:45.119 --> 42:46.370
She's family.

42:47.558 --> 42:49.802
If I want her dead, I'll do it myself.

42:51.414 --> 42:53.897
And I know Mia is on Smurf's payroll.

42:53.933 --> 42:55.271
Is that where all our money's going?

42:55.271 --> 42:57.691
- She's just a friend, man.
- I said don't lie to me.

43:10.319 --> 43:11.511
Want a beer?

43:11.987 --> 43:13.123
No.

43:16.025 --> 43:17.991
- Yeah, why do I always...
- Major, bro.

43:39.482 --> 43:42.764
<i>Water flows freely down the drain.</i>

43:42.811 --> 43:44.260
Come on, sweetie.

43:47.189 --> 43:48.606
Let's go home.

43:49.959 --> 43:51.225
Get you to bed.

43:53.636 --> 43:55.411
- That's good shit, right?
- Yeah.

43:55.906 --> 43:57.845
Wow. Oh, wow.

43:57.870 --> 43:59.136
See you later.

44:01.438 --> 44:02.543
Goodnight.
