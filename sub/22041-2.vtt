00:00.036 --> 00:01.115
(dramatic music)

00:01.115 --> 00:02.742
- Tonight on "Hotel Hell",

00:02.742 --> 00:06.120
imagine if a teenage boy designed a hotel.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.632
It would look like a Ferrari.

00:08.925 --> 00:09.916
It's a lot of red.

00:09.916 --> 00:12.875
There'd be a chocolate pizza on the menu.

00:12.875 --> 00:15.067
It's like someone's wipe
their arse with my dough.

00:15.067 --> 00:18.508
And there'd be hot waitresses
with super short skirts.

00:18.508 --> 00:20.520
Well, this is the Keating Hotel.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.126
Looks like a nightclub out
there with those ropes.

00:22.126 --> 00:23.898
It might seem like a teenager's dream,

00:23.898 --> 00:26.633
but it's actually the twisted
vision of a grown man.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.081
And for the staff who work here.

00:29.081 --> 00:30.374
- I'm at the end of my rope.

00:30.374 --> 00:31.906
- I have my days numbered here.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.206
- [Gordon] It's a living hell.

00:33.206 --> 00:36.894
Jesus Christ, call 911 urgently.

00:37.993 --> 00:41.468
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:04.105 --> 01:06.055
San Diego, California,

01:06.055 --> 01:09.246
is one of the top five vacation
destinations in the U.S.

01:09.246 --> 01:11.300
and is home to the Keating Hotel,

01:11.300 --> 01:12.169
which lies in the heart

01:12.169 --> 01:14.188
of the city's buzzing Gas Lamp quarter.

01:15.638 --> 01:16.972
- Buona sera, desk, this is Christos,

01:16.972 --> 01:18.341
how may be of service?

01:18.341 --> 01:19.662
(lively music)

01:19.662 --> 01:20.789
- The hotel is the brainchild

01:20.789 --> 01:23.051
of local property developer, Eddie Kaen.

01:23.051 --> 01:26.325
Everything about the place
is just the way he likes it.

01:26.325 --> 01:27.493
- The Keating was my vision.

01:27.493 --> 01:29.829
I was at the Ferrari
dealer looking at cars

01:29.829 --> 01:30.924
and kind of just hit me,

01:30.924 --> 01:33.051
why not have the Ferrari of hotels?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.490
(car engine roars)

01:34.490 --> 01:36.461
- [Gordon] But there's
35 room boutique hotel

01:36.461 --> 01:39.422
is far from living up
to guest expectation.

01:39.422 --> 01:41.872
- [Woman] Oh my gosh.

01:41.872 --> 01:45.532
- Eddie pitches this as
the Ferrari of hotels, but.

01:45.532 --> 01:48.144
- It feels like a
hospital, sterile almost.

01:48.144 --> 01:49.724
- This is all style and no substance.

01:49.724 --> 01:51.809
- I feel like it's a jail.

01:51.809 --> 01:54.114
Like I don't want to
take my shoes off ever.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.928
- This is not exactly luxury

01:58.076 --> 01:59.994
- [Gordon] Eddie hired
sports car design company

01:59.994 --> 02:02.320
and sank millions into
the interior design,

02:02.320 --> 02:05.615
but he spent peanuts on
things the hotel really needs.

02:05.615 --> 02:07.244
- Let's not use this
machine for the sheets

02:07.244 --> 02:10.161
because it has rust in the back.

02:10.161 --> 02:12.163
- [Gordon] Making life
a misery for his guests

02:12.163 --> 02:13.845
and his staff.

02:13.845 --> 02:15.114
- I have zero resources.

02:15.114 --> 02:18.649
Pretty much everything there
is to do here, I do it.

02:18.649 --> 02:20.765
How glamorous is this?

02:20.765 --> 02:23.615
It's hell operations here, to be honest.

02:25.447 --> 02:26.782
- [Gordon] Eddie's constantly adding ideas

02:26.782 --> 02:27.991
he's seen elsewhere,

02:27.991 --> 02:30.337
but that's hurting the
hotel and the restaurant

02:30.337 --> 02:32.120
- I believe our menu is fucking joke.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.674
It's like four pages long

02:33.674 --> 02:35.759
which are all favourites of Eddie's,

02:35.759 --> 02:37.845
but we're not feeding a fucking
million different eddies,

02:37.845 --> 02:40.128
we're feeding different people.

02:40.128 --> 02:42.662
- Food is horrible, absolutely horrible.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.852
- At the end of the day,
I am the owner, right?

02:44.852 --> 02:46.739
If there's something I want on the menu,

02:46.739 --> 02:47.844
chef's gonna do it.

02:47.844 --> 02:49.513
Yeah, I think it pissed him off.

02:50.649 --> 02:52.641
- Eddie will come in and say,

02:52.641 --> 02:55.487
I want a chicken parm slider on the menu.

02:55.487 --> 02:59.074
I had one in New York and I say, yes.

02:59.074 --> 03:01.590
I have stopped being proud of my food.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.091
- [Gordon] The hotel is
millions of dollars in debt

03:05.091 --> 03:06.603
and struggling to fill the rooms.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.730
So I have my work cut out for me

03:08.730 --> 03:10.315
if I'm gonna get this place back on track.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.973
- we're losing a lot of money.

03:11.973 --> 03:13.526
- It's a nightmare.
- But you should

03:13.526 --> 03:14.705
be able to handle that.

03:14.705 --> 03:16.091
- Eddie knows he's losing money.

03:16.091 --> 03:17.666
I just don't think he knows how to fix it.

03:17.666 --> 03:21.639
- I don't have any hope
that things will get better.

03:21.639 --> 03:24.812
If anything works around it's
because of pure dumb luck.

03:29.953 --> 03:32.994
- There it is, the Keating.

03:32.994 --> 03:35.726
Wow, it looks nice on
the outside, beautiful.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.064
Jesus, is that a dog outside?

03:39.064 --> 03:42.368
(bouncy music)

03:42.368 --> 03:43.452
Hello, how are you?

03:43.452 --> 03:44.626
- [Woman] Good, how are you?

03:44.626 --> 03:46.705
- [Gordon] Is that a
model dog or is he real?

03:46.705 --> 03:47.721
- [Woman] No, she's real,

03:47.721 --> 03:48.941
that's Smudge.
- What's her name?

03:48.941 --> 03:50.084
Smudge?
- That's right.

03:50.084 --> 03:52.287
- My God, she's ugly.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.413
Looks like a nightclub out
there with those ropes.

03:56.413 --> 03:58.029
How are we we?
- Hello, how are you?

03:58.029 --> 03:58.939
- Good to see you.
- Welcome.

03:58.939 --> 03:59.808
(record scratches)

03:59.808 --> 04:02.690
- There's a lot of red, wow.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.567
- I'm Christos.
- Christos, good to see you.

04:04.567 --> 04:05.745
What'd you do here?

04:05.745 --> 04:07.692
- Lifestyle concierge down
here at the front desk.

04:07.692 --> 04:09.593
- You gonna be advising me for
my life or are you gonna be?

04:09.593 --> 04:10.813
- You need dinner reservations.

04:10.813 --> 04:12.439
- So you organise everything?
- Anything you need.

04:12.439 --> 04:14.295
- Oh, now somebody likes red.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.995
Is that Smudge who likes red or?

04:15.995 --> 04:18.122
- No, it's both the
designer and the owner.

04:18.122 --> 04:19.634
- Wow, wow, wow.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.906
- Enjoy your stay.
- Right up stairs.

04:20.906 --> 04:22.137
- What floor we on?
- We're on the second floor.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.483
- Second floor, please.
- Perfect, thank you

04:27.121 --> 04:28.966
- Right here, they like
to always stop at the car.

04:28.966 --> 04:30.510
Each floor has a different model car.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.221
- [Gordon] Who's obsessed with
the super cars, who is that?

04:33.221 --> 04:34.618
- The owner.
- Oh really?

04:34.618 --> 04:36.665
- [Christos] So right
here, this is your room.

04:38.601 --> 04:40.394
Yes.
- Wow, it's so empty.

04:40.394 --> 04:42.323
More like a garage than a guest room.

04:43.502 --> 04:44.555
How much is this a night?

04:44.555 --> 04:45.601
- [Christos] 759.

04:46.783 --> 04:48.976
- $759?

04:48.976 --> 04:51.065
Wow, that's incredibly expensive.

04:51.979 --> 04:53.157
What's happening there?

04:53.157 --> 04:55.034
- [Christos] That is actually Jacuzzi tub.

04:55.034 --> 04:56.077
- In the middle of the lounge?

04:56.077 --> 04:57.610
- It is in the middle of the lounge.

04:57.610 --> 04:58.715
- Wow.
- When they designed

04:58.715 --> 05:00.696
the rooms, they took away
all the interior walls.

05:00.696 --> 05:03.876
- But without sounding stupid,
these are car designers.

05:03.876 --> 05:05.148
- Correct, they are car designed.

05:05.148 --> 05:07.880
- Now they're putting Jacuzzis
in the middle of suites.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.737
Last time I checked, a living
room was for sitting in,

05:10.737 --> 05:11.940
not taking a bath.

05:12.917 --> 05:14.220
How much do these things cost?

05:14.220 --> 05:15.555
- The Jacuzzi tub itself
- Yeah?

05:15.555 --> 05:17.150
- is about $20,000.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.371
- You don't take baths in cars.

05:19.371 --> 05:21.623
Jesus, this is crazy.

05:21.623 --> 05:24.077
Who wanted all these specially designed?

05:24.077 --> 05:25.687
- That is the owner, that's Eddie.

05:25.687 --> 05:27.598
- That's Eddie?
- Yes.

05:27.598 --> 05:28.842
- This is crazy.

05:30.695 --> 05:33.437
Shit, the sports car inspired furniture

05:33.437 --> 05:35.637
looks cheap and isn't even functional.

05:35.637 --> 05:37.712
- It's different than anything else.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.349
- Different from a nice hotel room.

05:39.349 --> 05:41.122
- Oh, I don't know about that.

05:41.122 --> 05:43.364
- [Gordon] Who on earth
would wanna sit here

05:43.364 --> 05:45.376
and sort of
- Watch the television?

05:45.376 --> 05:48.327
- [Gordon] and watch the
television this close?

05:48.327 --> 05:49.265
- It works though.

05:50.715 --> 05:52.529
- The sheets, how come
they're all so wrinkled

05:52.529 --> 05:53.509
when have you slept in there?

05:53.509 --> 05:55.584
Why is that?
- We do them in house.

05:55.584 --> 05:57.555
- When you say we, what'd you
mean, you don't do laundry?

05:57.555 --> 05:59.223
- Lifestyle means everything.

05:59.223 --> 06:00.840
Your mouth wash.

06:00.840 --> 06:01.799
- It's like gas.

06:01.799 --> 06:03.749
Socket' all broken and smashed down there.

06:03.749 --> 06:05.417
Someone's left the dirty ones there.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.294
Plastic plants.

06:07.294 --> 06:09.202
That's outrageous, $800.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.247
- Oh my gosh, Gordon doesn't
like anything about the hotel,

06:12.247 --> 06:13.665
damn it.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.000
- Anything else?
- If I have any

06:15.000 --> 06:16.543
lifestyle needs, I'll call.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.315
- [Christos] Thank you, of course.

06:19.848 --> 06:22.559
- So far, I'm not impressed
with the Keating's pretentious

06:22.559 --> 06:24.009
and uncomfortable design,

06:24.009 --> 06:26.761
but maybe it can redeem
itself with a one thing

06:26.761 --> 06:30.121
every luxury hotel should
have, impeccable room service.

06:30.121 --> 06:31.688
I'm starving.

06:31.688 --> 06:33.448
(phone rings)

06:33.448 --> 06:35.322
- Bonjourno, the desk, this is Christos,

06:35.322 --> 06:36.636
how many I be of service?
- Hi Christos, it's Gordon.

06:36.636 --> 06:37.991
What's a little bit bizarre for me

06:37.991 --> 06:40.382
is I'm ordering room
service at the front desk.

06:40.382 --> 06:43.486
There's no direct line
down to the kitchen?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.280
- There is no direct
line down to the kitchen.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.283
The communication between
departments isn't really there.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.670
So we take care of everything

06:49.670 --> 06:51.609
and make sure it happens.

06:51.609 --> 06:52.687
- Listen, I'm starving.

06:52.687 --> 06:53.837
I'll have a tomato soup please

06:53.837 --> 06:56.030
and a pizza and a barbecue chicken,

06:56.030 --> 06:58.960
I'm fascinated to see the
chicken parmesan sliders.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.829
I'll have one of those.
- I'll have that up

06:59.829 --> 07:01.389
as soon i they can.

07:01.389 --> 07:03.416
- Brilliant, thank you, bye.
- Bye-bye.

07:06.716 --> 07:09.429
(intense music)

07:09.429 --> 07:10.597
- [Gordon] Hello?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.797
- Hello, how are you?
- How are you.

07:12.797 --> 07:14.486
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

07:14.486 --> 07:17.354
- [Gordon] Wow, is this
how it's normally served,

07:17.354 --> 07:20.226
in a to-go box?
- Yes, yes.

07:20.226 --> 07:21.803
- You pay $800 a night to stay here

07:21.803 --> 07:24.746
and you gotta meet your food out of boxes

07:24.746 --> 07:26.042
and plastic containers.

07:26.999 --> 07:29.703
Are we short of soup 'cause
it's not even half full?

07:29.703 --> 07:30.638
- That's how they serve it.

07:30.638 --> 07:32.077
- That's how they, that much?

07:32.077 --> 07:34.402
- Yes, it's one cup.

07:34.402 --> 07:36.279
- It's like a retirement home.

07:36.279 --> 07:37.339
Is that luxury you think?

07:37.339 --> 07:38.938
- No, not at all.

07:38.938 --> 07:43.192
- What would you rather
do, sip that out of a cup?

07:43.192 --> 07:44.130
- Of course.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.342
- Jeez, we barely got half a cup.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.718
Anyway, I'll dig in.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.762
- If there's anything else I
can do for you, just go ahead

07:50.762 --> 07:52.371
and let us know, okay?
- Okay, brilliant.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.350
Darling?

07:55.350 --> 07:56.500
- [Waitress] I'm sorry?

07:59.552 --> 08:01.700
- You can take that now, it's finished.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.152
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.874
A chicken parmesan slider.

08:08.707 --> 08:09.576
That's dreadful.

08:12.231 --> 08:15.015
Fuck me, now I know
why they got the boxes,

08:15.015 --> 08:16.343
is a takeaway puke box.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.479
Pizza, unappetizing in a box,

08:20.479 --> 08:22.544
especially when you're
spending $800 a night.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.504
This place is obsessed with design,

08:24.504 --> 08:27.079
but serves room service
in plastic containers.

08:27.079 --> 08:29.196
No wonder they can't fill the rooms.

08:29.196 --> 08:30.228
That is not my idea of luxury.

08:30.228 --> 08:32.567
Let me tell you that's embarrassing.

08:33.732 --> 08:34.601
Wow.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.696
(dramatic music)

08:39.696 --> 08:42.345
How can this place call
itself a luxury hotel?

08:42.345 --> 08:43.929
I need to get some answers from Eddie,

08:43.929 --> 08:46.656
the Keatings owner and visionary.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.218
Hey, how are you?
- Hey Gordon, how are you?

08:48.218 --> 08:49.279
- Good to see you.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.042
This place has been your baby in many ways

08:52.042 --> 08:54.148
and I'm dying to find out the vision,

08:54.148 --> 08:56.088
the insight into why?

08:56.088 --> 08:57.360
Give us a little tour.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.956
- [Eddie] I bought the
building back in 2000.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.395
That was around 6 million.

09:01.395 --> 09:03.626
- Did he go to hotel school?

09:03.626 --> 09:04.794
- No.
- You've never run

09:04.794 --> 09:05.847
a business before?

09:05.847 --> 09:07.120
- Not a hotel business, no.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.496
- Wow.
- So I was actually

09:08.496 --> 09:10.331
at the Ferrari dealer
looking at cars and stuff

09:10.331 --> 09:11.363
and it kind of hit me,

09:11.363 --> 09:12.844
why not the Ferrari of hotels?

09:12.844 --> 09:14.961
- I'm more concerned what
you were smoking at the time

09:14.961 --> 09:16.942
and what you're thinking.

09:16.942 --> 09:19.747
Why would you one of
the most high spec cars

09:19.747 --> 09:22.197
anywhere in the world
and turn it into a hotel?

09:23.313 --> 09:24.908
- I don't know where he's coming from,

09:24.908 --> 09:26.139
but it does piss me off.

09:26.139 --> 09:29.298
I designed the Keating to
be the perfect hotel for me,

09:29.298 --> 09:30.799
not for him.

09:30.799 --> 09:32.384
- Where should I start?

09:32.384 --> 09:34.553
the floor, it's all scuffed and marked.

09:34.553 --> 09:36.566
When you have a resin floor,
it needs to be updated.

09:36.566 --> 09:38.651
I mean everything's just marked to hell.

09:38.651 --> 09:40.288
It feels cheap.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.853
The sheets, you can't call
yourself a luxury hotel

09:42.853 --> 09:44.675
if you don't have
beautifully press sheets.

09:44.675 --> 09:45.627
- Okay.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.702
- [Gordon] What's the
idea behind sitting here?

09:47.702 --> 09:49.109
- So when you have guests, you know,

09:49.109 --> 09:50.337
we can sit down and talk and--

09:50.337 --> 09:51.876
- Yeah, but where's the
sofa, where's the table,

09:51.876 --> 09:53.054
where's the fun?

09:54.031 --> 09:55.606
Do you know what hurt the most?

09:55.606 --> 09:58.588
I got soup served in a plastic bowl,

09:58.588 --> 10:00.631
there's a chicken Parmesan slider

10:00.631 --> 10:03.812
that tasted like it was
cooked three days ago.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.365
Who in the fuck would put

10:05.365 --> 10:07.628
a chicken Parmesan slider together?

10:07.628 --> 10:09.870
There's things that don't go in sliders

10:09.870 --> 10:11.236
and chicken parm is one of them.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.529
- That was my idea.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.041
- But you're laughing as if it's funny

10:14.041 --> 10:15.792
and you think because you own the place,

10:15.792 --> 10:18.743
you can put that in a roll and sell it?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.213
- I don't know what he's talking about.

10:20.213 --> 10:21.809
This place is not bad.

10:21.809 --> 10:24.489
So I think Gordon's comments
were complete bullshit.

10:24.489 --> 10:28.096
- You're trying to convince me
this is your idea of luxury?

10:28.096 --> 10:29.037
- I don't know what to say.

10:29.037 --> 10:30.536
- When's the last time
you stayed in the hotel?

10:30.536 --> 10:31.405
- [Eddie] It's been awhile.

10:31.405 --> 10:33.977
- You cannot stand that and tell me

10:33.977 --> 10:35.875
that there's nothing wrong with this place

10:35.875 --> 10:37.491
when you don't even stay in it.

10:39.224 --> 10:41.464
You bought a building that was your dream

10:41.464 --> 10:44.248
but it doesn't feel like a
dream experience to a guest,

10:44.248 --> 10:45.763
nowhere fucking near it.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.534
(dramatic music)

10:51.818 --> 10:54.133
I'm at the Keating Hotel in San Diego

10:54.133 --> 10:55.697
and I've just met Eddie, the owner,

10:55.697 --> 10:57.251
who's completely oblivious to the fact

10:57.251 --> 10:59.107
that his super car inspired hotel

10:59.107 --> 11:01.234
is seriously underperforming.

11:01.234 --> 11:03.184
You're the owner and he bought a building,

11:03.184 --> 11:04.456
that was your dream,

11:04.456 --> 11:07.261
but it doesn't feel like a
dream experience to a guest,

11:07.261 --> 11:08.828
nowhere fucking near it.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.891
I desperately wanna help you

11:12.891 --> 11:15.626
only if you start
identifying the problems.

11:16.541 --> 11:17.409
- Okay.

11:17.409 --> 11:19.168
- Could you send that young lady up

11:19.168 --> 11:21.566
to clear that dog shit
out of there, please?

11:21.566 --> 11:22.435
Jesus.

11:24.111 --> 11:26.478
Trust me, Eddie is not
used to honesty like that.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.167
Right now he looks like a baby

11:28.167 --> 11:30.148
that's just how he's lollipops stolen.

11:32.619 --> 11:33.488
- [Sandra] How are you?

11:33.488 --> 11:34.652
- Who is this guy?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.300
First thing he does,
he lays right into me.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.772
The room services was terrible.

11:39.772 --> 11:41.211
- Welcome to my world.

11:41.211 --> 11:42.702
- He opened the bed up and the sheets

11:42.702 --> 11:44.590
were all like wrinkled and.

11:44.590 --> 11:47.283
- Most hotels have those
giant ironing things

11:47.283 --> 11:49.115
that the sheets go through there.

11:49.115 --> 11:50.314
We don't have that.

11:50.314 --> 11:52.337
I tell Eddie the problems that we have,

11:52.337 --> 11:54.381
but it might be sometimes
you tell people something

11:54.381 --> 11:55.413
and it goes one side to another.

11:55.413 --> 11:57.238
- I was in shock.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.094
- [Sandra] Maybe Gordon
will get him to wake up.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.282
- I don't know what to say.

12:00.282 --> 12:02.229
That was very embarrassing.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.625
- [Gordon] After my meeting with Eddie,

12:09.625 --> 12:12.534
I'm ready to see how this
so-called luxury hotel runs

12:12.534 --> 12:13.983
on a normal night.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.850
- [Christos] Hi there, how are you guys?

12:15.850 --> 12:19.392
- Are you a luxury-lifestyle
concierge as well?

12:19.392 --> 12:22.169
- No, I am actually
Sandra, the GM of a hotel.

12:22.169 --> 12:23.503
- You're the general manager?

12:23.503 --> 12:24.372
Oh, we haven't met.
- Yes.

12:24.372 --> 12:25.241
- How long we been here?

12:25.241 --> 12:26.517
- [Sandra] I've been here for six years.

12:26.517 --> 12:28.811
- Okay, so you here from the beginning?

12:28.811 --> 12:30.208
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.366
- I gotta look to tell you.

12:31.366 --> 12:32.909
- You got a lot to tell me?

12:32.909 --> 12:35.036
Yeah, I bet she does

12:35.036 --> 12:36.151
because the Keating seems to have

12:36.151 --> 12:38.529
more complaints and guests.

12:38.529 --> 12:41.052
- Our room is not very clean.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.847
There's a hair in the sheets as well.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.494
- We turned down our bed

12:45.494 --> 12:47.215
and there's what appears
to be a bunch of sand.

12:47.215 --> 12:48.508
- There's sand?

12:48.508 --> 12:49.564
What do you think of the red?

12:49.564 --> 12:50.711
- It's like a brothel.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.808
- You've been in a brothel?

12:53.808 --> 12:55.801
- I haven't, it's just what I've heard.

12:55.801 --> 12:57.266
- Wow, I can confirm

12:57.266 --> 12:59.474
it is like a brothel.
- Is it?

13:00.606 --> 13:02.066
(Gordon giggles)

13:02.066 --> 13:03.710
- Cheese plate?
- Let me check

13:03.710 --> 13:04.726
on that right now.

13:04.726 --> 13:06.963
- We've been waiting for 45 minutes.

13:06.963 --> 13:08.329
You know, if it's not up in 10 minutes,

13:08.329 --> 13:09.198
just cancel it
- I'm to sure.

13:09.198 --> 13:10.623
- 'cause we're going to dinner, okay?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.323
- Okay.

13:12.323 --> 13:13.866
- How can they make a guest wait so long

13:13.866 --> 13:15.795
for something that's not even cooked?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.715
The system for room service
here is clearly not working.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.123
Taking the orders at the front desk

13:20.123 --> 13:22.260
then pass them to the kitchen is madness.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.647
I've never seen anything like this before.

13:23.647 --> 13:25.743
Let's go through the kitchen together.

13:25.743 --> 13:27.098
- Okay.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.872
- [Gordon] Weirdly, the
hotels restaurant, the Merk,

13:29.872 --> 13:31.957
is in a separate building
around the corner.

13:31.957 --> 13:35.127
Can you believe that waiting
45 minutes for a cheeseboard?

13:35.127 --> 13:37.911
- [Christos] I can't believe
it, but I'm not surprised.

13:37.911 --> 13:39.965
- She looked pretty pissed.
- She did look pretty pissed.

13:39.965 --> 13:43.062
They sounded pissed the three
times they called as well.

13:43.062 --> 13:44.564
- Wow, is this cheese board?
- What is it?

13:44.564 --> 13:47.462
- Yes.
- Where's the fucking cheese?

13:47.462 --> 13:48.745
Is that it?
- That is it.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.872
- How much is that?
- 16.00 I believe.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.447
- [Gordon] You're kidding me.

13:52.447 --> 13:55.596
I can guarantee someone's
gonna complain about that.

13:55.596 --> 13:56.795
Hello.
- How are you, Gordon?

13:56.795 --> 13:58.473
- Good, how are you?
- My name is Aaron,

13:58.473 --> 13:59.493
the manager.
- Oh you're the manager?

13:59.493 --> 14:01.350
- Nice to meet you, Gordon.
- Nice to see you.

14:01.350 --> 14:02.634
You're the manager of the restaurant?

14:02.634 --> 14:03.739
- Yes sir.

14:03.739 --> 14:04.719
- That cheese portion there,

14:04.719 --> 14:06.909
barely two little slivers of cheese,

14:06.909 --> 14:08.296
they waited 45 minutes for it

14:08.296 --> 14:10.611
and it's like no one gives a shit.

14:10.611 --> 14:12.154
- Oh, I definitely do
ow that you've told me.

14:12.154 --> 14:14.239
This is the first time
that I've heard of it.

14:14.239 --> 14:15.449
- Why would they wait 45 minutes

14:15.449 --> 14:16.531
for something that's already?

14:16.531 --> 14:17.816
- I think the process unfortunately

14:17.816 --> 14:18.879
is a little bit slow here.

14:18.879 --> 14:20.256
I think getting up the stairs

14:20.256 --> 14:21.330
is a little bit of a challenge.

14:21.330 --> 14:23.571
- Why don't you take
the call in the kitchen?

14:23.571 --> 14:25.354
- Oh, in the kitchen itself,
we can take that call.

14:25.354 --> 14:27.042
It's definitely an option,
but we've always just--

14:27.042 --> 14:28.429
- Would you think that's faster?

14:28.429 --> 14:30.724
- I think as the hotel
takes it, it's just as fast.

14:30.724 --> 14:32.017
- [Gordon] Even though
the customers are unhappy

14:32.017 --> 14:34.259
with the wait that they've had to endure,

14:34.259 --> 14:35.594
you don't wanna do anything for them?

14:35.594 --> 14:36.970
- [Aaron] I didn't know how
long the customer was waiting

14:36.970 --> 14:37.839
until just now.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.770
- [Gordon] Wow, okay, manager, fuck me.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.030
Aaron the restaurant manager

14:45.030 --> 14:47.606
isn't taking any responsibility.

14:47.606 --> 14:49.848
If he worked for me, he'd be long gone.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.255
How fucking weird.

14:51.255 --> 14:52.788
How's you rate him out of 10?

14:52.788 --> 14:54.279
- Can we go in the negatives?

14:54.279 --> 14:57.022
Aaron is the king of
excuses as far as being able

14:57.022 --> 14:58.961
to kind of weasel his way out of things.

14:58.961 --> 15:01.064
But I'm not in charge of firing him.

15:02.871 --> 15:04.216
How are we doing over here guys?

15:04.216 --> 15:06.010
- No wonder the hotel is half empty.

15:06.010 --> 15:07.073
They can't even get the basics

15:07.073 --> 15:08.992
like room service and laundry right.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.879
Maybe Sandra the GM can tell me

15:10.879 --> 15:12.579
what the hell is going on here.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.447
Right, we haven't a chance

15:13.447 --> 15:14.603
to catch up.
- Yes sir, yeah, yeah,

15:14.603 --> 15:16.048
absolutely.
- Thank you.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.719
So all these issues with the laundry,

15:17.719 --> 15:19.273
where's the laundry done?

15:19.273 --> 15:20.785
- Let me show you.
- Please.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.195
Oh, here we are.

15:24.195 --> 15:25.425
So this is the laundry room?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.145
Wow, bloody hell.

15:27.145 --> 15:29.022
You have got your work cut out.

15:29.022 --> 15:31.389
These are domestic.
- I know.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.725
- These washing machines are
designed for small families,

15:33.725 --> 15:35.164
not a 35 bedroom hotel.

15:35.164 --> 15:37.447
Wow, no wonder they struggle.

15:37.447 --> 15:39.554
Your lifestyle concierges come in here

15:39.554 --> 15:41.066
throughout their day to do laundry

15:41.066 --> 15:42.640
and attend the front desk

15:42.640 --> 15:44.444
and take room service orders.
- We all do.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.487
- I mean this is crazy.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.187
- It is insane, it is insane.
- Absolutely crazy.

15:47.187 --> 15:48.625
- I don't know how we do it sometimes.

15:48.625 --> 15:50.127
- Who presses the sheets?

15:50.127 --> 15:52.279
- We don't, we don't have equipment.

15:52.279 --> 15:54.051
- So you don't press them?
- Yes.

15:55.339 --> 15:56.393
Can I show you where we iron

15:56.393 --> 15:58.667
the pillow cases?
- Yeah, so, oh my God,

15:58.667 --> 15:59.803
it's somewhere else?

15:59.803 --> 16:01.826
You seem to know all these problems

16:01.826 --> 16:02.869
and you're the general manager.

16:02.869 --> 16:05.197
But if there's one person
who can stop this, is you.

16:05.197 --> 16:06.914
- I the owner, well, yes, I can quit.

16:06.914 --> 16:07.902
I can leave to another hotel

16:07.902 --> 16:10.011
and go where everything is much better.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.575
It is hell to run this place.

16:11.575 --> 16:13.244
- You're a general manager

16:13.244 --> 16:14.630
yet you're managing nothing?

16:14.630 --> 16:15.631
- I spoke to the owner.

16:15.631 --> 16:17.341
I said, this has to change.

16:17.341 --> 16:18.554
- What's going on?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.345
- Gordon is totally right
with that he's saying

16:21.345 --> 16:24.046
but it's Eddie being is
so involved in everything

16:24.046 --> 16:25.443
that's the problem.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.259
I have conversations with
the owner about what works

16:28.259 --> 16:30.094
and what doesn't work in the restaurant.

16:30.094 --> 16:32.012
No matter how many times
I say, you know what?

16:32.012 --> 16:33.722
We should not have a book as the menu.

16:33.722 --> 16:36.506
Eddie comes up with whatever he wants.

16:36.506 --> 16:38.731
- But no one's taking responsibility.

16:39.645 --> 16:43.850
I pulled back my duvet and
the sheets were shocking.

16:44.887 --> 16:50.100
$800 a night to stay in
something pretty mediocre,

16:50.865 --> 16:51.963
you should be ashamed.

16:51.963 --> 16:54.451
- I am ashamed, I am ashamed.

16:54.451 --> 16:55.320
- I've gotta get out here.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.936
Let me get down to the restaurant.

16:57.936 --> 17:00.890
(dramatic music)

17:02.936 --> 17:04.638
Coming up, I've never seen anything

17:04.638 --> 17:06.869
so fucking unappetizing.

17:06.869 --> 17:09.300
Things at the Keating
go from bad to worse.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.229
- [Dave] I wouldn't serve
any of our dishes to my dog.

17:11.229 --> 17:13.012
- Are you okay?

17:13.012 --> 17:15.347
And one of the staff
reaches his breaking point.

17:15.347 --> 17:18.990
Call 911 please, quickly, 911 urgently.

17:18.990 --> 17:22.464
(ambulance siren wails)

17:26.181 --> 17:28.037
For so-called luxury hotel,

17:28.037 --> 17:30.592
the Keating has been a
major disappointment.

17:30.592 --> 17:31.655
It's like gas.

17:31.655 --> 17:33.136
The owners misguided vision.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.189
You're trying to convince me

17:34.189 --> 17:36.087
this is your idea of luxury?

17:36.087 --> 17:37.672
Is taking its toll on the staff.

17:37.672 --> 17:40.268
- It is hell to run this place.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.187
- Hopefully the food in
the hotels restaurant

17:42.187 --> 17:44.272
is better than it was in my room.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.203
How are you, darling?

17:47.192 --> 17:49.051
Table of one please.

17:53.041 --> 17:54.105
Hey.
- Good evening.

17:54.105 --> 17:54.973
- How are you?

17:54.973 --> 17:55.842
- [David] I'm very well and yourself?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.504
- Very well thank you
and sorry, first name is?

17:57.504 --> 18:00.121
- My name's David.
- David, so what'd you do?

18:00.121 --> 18:03.020
- I am actually the
restaurant manager here.

18:03.020 --> 18:04.303
- I thought I just met
the restaurant manager,

18:04.303 --> 18:05.596
the little man.
- I'm the other

18:05.596 --> 18:06.586
restaurant manager.

18:08.411 --> 18:09.422
- And the food,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.299
how would you rate the food out of 10?

18:11.299 --> 18:12.853
- Six.
- Six.

18:12.853 --> 18:15.428
- I wouldn't serve any
of our dishes to my dog.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.919
Chef Brian's kinda given up.

18:16.919 --> 18:19.870
So much has been taken out
of Brian's hands by Eddie

18:19.870 --> 18:22.477
that I don't think that he
has the passion and the drive

18:22.477 --> 18:23.780
to be that great anymore.

18:24.948 --> 18:26.784
- Starting off with chicken under a brick,

18:26.784 --> 18:28.379
what does that actually mean?

18:28.379 --> 18:30.165
- It means it's drier than a bone.

18:31.872 --> 18:34.538
- Amazing, even the manager
thinks the food's terrible here

18:34.538 --> 18:36.908
and he's not embarrassed to tell me.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.338
And then the cavatappi?

18:39.338 --> 18:40.342
- Cavatappie?
- Yeah, here we go.

18:40.342 --> 18:43.227
With chicken, sundried tomato, mushrooms,

18:43.227 --> 18:44.176
you like that one?
- No.

18:44.176 --> 18:45.469
- Oh shit, really?

18:45.469 --> 18:46.783
I'm still gonna try it.

18:46.783 --> 18:49.848
So for desserts, I'll go
for the chocolate pig.

18:49.848 --> 18:52.090
- The 10 inch dessert pizza.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.918
Chocolate, strawberries, bacon.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.740
- How can I resist that?

18:56.740 --> 18:58.961
Thank you very much indeed, thank you.

18:58.961 --> 19:00.192
- The table I'm ringing right now,

19:00.192 --> 19:01.860
just bring it as it comes, okay?

19:01.860 --> 19:03.489
Everything's under fire.

19:03.489 --> 19:06.651
(dramatic music)

19:06.651 --> 19:08.819
- [Chef] Order up,
that's for Gordon, serve.

19:08.819 --> 19:09.688
- Right, what do we have here?

19:09.688 --> 19:12.243
- [Dave] This is the brick chicken, $21.

19:12.243 --> 19:14.487
- $21, brick chicken?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.722
Yeah, it looks like
someone just shat a brick.

19:18.156 --> 19:21.370
(customers chatting)

19:22.330 --> 19:23.551
It's so dry.
- Yeah.

19:23.551 --> 19:24.591
- I mean really dry.

19:24.591 --> 19:26.458
- [Dave] That's actually
better than usual.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.719
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:27.719 --> 19:30.316
Chicken under a brick is
where it should have stayed

19:30.316 --> 19:32.696
because it should have never
come out of the kitchen.

19:35.456 --> 19:37.941
- Wow, okay.
- Pardon my reaching.

19:37.941 --> 19:39.481
This is the cavatappi and chicken.

19:39.481 --> 19:40.350
- Okay.

19:42.985 --> 19:44.841
Bland, chicken's dry,

19:44.841 --> 19:47.687
way too much Rosemarie and just, it's shit

19:50.148 --> 19:52.640
At least I saved room for dessert.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.830
- What you have here is the chocolate pig.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.480
White and dark chocolate,
strawberries, bacon.

19:59.480 --> 20:00.513
- It's like we've had a crisis

20:00.513 --> 20:01.659
with the toilet paper department.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.745
Someone's wiped their ass with my dough.

20:05.549 --> 20:07.175
I mean, it's just,

20:07.175 --> 20:09.918
I've never seen anything
so fucking unappetizing

20:09.918 --> 20:11.565
as a dessert in all my life.

20:11.565 --> 20:13.296
- Absolutely.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.267
- Bacon and chocolate pizza,

20:15.267 --> 20:17.753
O, M, F, G.

20:17.753 --> 20:20.534
(intense music)

20:24.851 --> 20:26.226
- Did you see him spit it out?
- Yeah,

20:26.226 --> 20:28.492
he didn't like any of it, not one thing.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.389
- Fuck me.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.964
Is the chef off tonight?

20:34.964 --> 20:35.840
- [David] No, he's in the back.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.708
- He's in the back.

20:36.708 --> 20:38.332
Is he cooking or?
- No.

20:38.332 --> 20:40.796
- So he's here but he's not cooking.

20:45.008 --> 20:49.092
I would really like to
meet the executive chef.

20:52.544 --> 20:56.037
- [Dave] Chef, Brian
Rutherfor, Gordon Ramsay.

20:56.037 --> 20:56.905
- How are you?

20:58.477 --> 20:59.884
Let's go somewhere out the.

21:01.970 --> 21:02.867
I'm lost for words.

21:02.867 --> 21:05.640
I just, I dunno, I didn't
know where to start.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.599
Why wouldn't you cook for me?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.049
Why wouldn't you do that?

21:08.049 --> 21:10.937
- It's not a question of
me not cooking for you.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.408
It's do you want to see
what we're doing here

21:13.408 --> 21:14.576
and improve it?

21:14.576 --> 21:16.672
Because I want this to improve.

21:16.672 --> 21:17.746
- [Gordon] You've been here for how long?

21:17.746 --> 21:19.863
- Five years.
- Five years, but you've been

21:19.863 --> 21:22.357
cooking for 30 years?
- 33 years.

21:22.357 --> 21:23.523
- 33 years.

21:23.523 --> 21:24.993
I didn't see you on the line,

21:24.993 --> 21:26.995
I didn't see you taste anything.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.237
I didn't even see you inspire anybody.

21:29.237 --> 21:32.636
- This position is killing me in my soul.

21:32.636 --> 21:36.598
I've just been doing
everything that Eddie wanted.

21:36.598 --> 21:39.205
We have too large a menu

21:39.205 --> 21:41.009
for the amount of business we do.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.168
I have 120 items on the menu

21:44.168 --> 21:45.889
and we do 50 people a night.

21:45.889 --> 21:49.309
How much of this am I able
to prep on a regular basis

21:49.309 --> 21:51.029
to have quality?

21:51.029 --> 21:53.219
- But you're the executive
chef on the menu.

21:53.219 --> 21:54.088
- Yes I am.
- How can you let

21:54.088 --> 21:56.222
that food go out with your name above it?

21:57.588 --> 22:01.905
You can't just give up and
almost you know abandoned ship

22:01.905 --> 22:03.584
before it's sunk.

22:03.584 --> 22:05.106
- I'm at the end of my rope.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.357
- You're toast.

22:06.357 --> 22:07.713
- I'm tired.

22:07.713 --> 22:09.780
- But you're your own experience guy.

22:12.170 --> 22:13.299
Are you okay?

22:14.401 --> 22:17.066
(dramatic music)

22:17.066 --> 22:18.564
Look at me, loo at me, stand.

22:18.564 --> 22:19.519
Are you okay?

22:21.028 --> 22:22.884
Are you on medication?
- No.

22:22.884 --> 22:25.512
- Excuse me, can you get
me some water please?

22:25.512 --> 22:26.992
Quickly.

22:26.992 --> 22:28.609
Can you get me a chair, please?

22:30.037 --> 22:30.906
A chair.

22:34.067 --> 22:36.731
Jesus Christ, call 911 please.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.087
Quickly, 911.

22:38.087 --> 22:41.986
Jesus, come here, Jesus Christ, urgently.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.290
- What happened?
- The chefs on the floor.

22:43.290 --> 22:44.999
- [David] Oh shit.

22:44.999 --> 22:46.067
- [Gordon] You okay?

22:46.067 --> 22:48.107
Call 911, Jesus Christ.

22:48.107 --> 22:50.140
- [David] Chef just fell, collapsed.

22:50.140 --> 22:54.168
- Can I have some water please
and a cold cloth urgently?

22:55.938 --> 22:56.884
Try to stay alert.

22:56.884 --> 23:00.503
(ambulance siren wails)

23:00.503 --> 23:03.110
Look at me, look at me, Brian.

23:05.356 --> 23:07.230
Can you give me a chair please?

23:07.230 --> 23:08.099
A chair.

23:11.453 --> 23:15.791
Jesus Christ, call 911
please, quickly, 911.

23:15.791 --> 23:18.598
Jesus, come here, Jesus Christ.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.372
- [chef] Call 911, chef's on the floor.

23:21.995 --> 23:24.008
- [Dave] Chef just fell, collapsed.

23:24.008 --> 23:26.302
- Just try and stay
alert, drink some water.

23:27.595 --> 23:30.427
No job is worth this, let me tell you.

23:30.427 --> 23:33.345
(ambulance siren wails)

23:33.345 --> 23:35.384
(dramatic music)

23:35.384 --> 23:36.260
I was with the gentleman,

23:36.260 --> 23:37.128
we were just standing talking

23:37.128 --> 23:38.366
and then unfortunately, he just collapsed

23:38.366 --> 23:40.337
an banged his head on the back here.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.965
- I am really pissed off at Gordon.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.613
He's stressing everybody out.

23:45.613 --> 23:48.449
Everyone seems to be
at their boiling point.

23:48.449 --> 23:49.940
- Has he been stressed out for long?

23:49.940 --> 23:52.797
- I mean, this has been a
lot of stress on all of us.

23:52.797 --> 23:54.976
- What, me being here?
- Yeah.

23:54.976 --> 23:58.000
- But do not dare fucking go anywhere near

23:58.000 --> 24:00.169
that I put him in that ambulance.

24:00.169 --> 24:01.441
- Got it.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.964
- Let me tell you something,
150 items on a fucking menu

24:03.964 --> 24:05.841
the size of a fucking shoe box

24:05.841 --> 24:08.222
could send that man to an
early grave, let me tell you.

24:09.369 --> 24:11.141
It's like he's a dead man walking.

24:12.306 --> 24:15.549
What he tried to tell me in
a five minute conversation

24:15.549 --> 24:17.665
is that you've overburdened him

24:17.665 --> 24:19.198
'cause he does whatever you want.

24:19.198 --> 24:22.149
You pay his salary, but
you're not behind that line.

24:22.149 --> 24:23.463
You have no catering experience,

24:23.463 --> 24:25.340
you haven't spent a day in a kitchen.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.014
I've never seen anything so fragmented.

24:28.014 --> 24:28.883
- Okay.

24:28.883 --> 24:30.981
- It's like you're a little magpie,

24:30.981 --> 24:32.639
a little spoiled fucking magpie

24:32.639 --> 24:34.547
that's going around picking
up little bits of glitter

24:34.547 --> 24:35.725
and running back and get your army

24:35.725 --> 24:38.840
to expedite it for you all.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.334
All that matters right now

24:40.334 --> 24:43.184
is that that guy wakes up
tomorrow feeling better.

24:44.129 --> 24:46.814
Enough was enough for one day, yeah?

24:46.814 --> 24:48.726
Thank you, good night.

24:53.446 --> 24:55.966
(calm music)

24:59.475 --> 25:01.529
For me, the most important
thing is that he's okay.

25:01.529 --> 25:04.076
But that guy has the
world on his shoulders

25:04.076 --> 25:05.547
and tonight proved that.

25:14.691 --> 25:15.922
What a day yesterday.

25:15.922 --> 25:18.508
The good news is that
Brian's out of hospital

25:18.508 --> 25:20.822
and they said it was
dehydration and anxiety.

25:20.822 --> 25:22.824
So I'm gonna shoot over to his house.

25:22.824 --> 25:25.953
Keep the cameras outside and
hopefully have a chat with him.

25:29.779 --> 25:30.864
How are you, sir?

25:30.864 --> 25:32.393
- Come on in.
- I'm so glad to see you,

25:32.393 --> 25:33.262
you know that?

25:33.262 --> 25:34.906
I'm telling you, how you feeling?

25:34.906 --> 25:37.214
- [Brian] I'm feeling well.

25:37.214 --> 25:39.841
We've got immense troubles at the hotel.

25:39.841 --> 25:41.499
- [Gordon] You cannot
continue driving yourself

25:41.499 --> 25:43.668
into the ground on that.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.758
- [Brian] Eddie takes
advantage of my good nature.

25:47.891 --> 25:48.760
- [Gordon] Do you feel well enough

25:48.760 --> 25:50.029
to come back to the restaurant today?

25:50.029 --> 25:51.134
- Yeah.
- Good.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.708
Let's get you back in there and trust me,

25:52.708 --> 25:54.940
this time, it's on your terms, not Eddies.

25:54.940 --> 25:56.233
- [Brian] Definitely.

25:56.233 --> 25:57.637
- [Gordon] Good to see you.

26:00.347 --> 26:02.395
(bouncy music)

26:02.395 --> 26:05.284
The restaurant is the beating
heart of any good hotel.

26:05.284 --> 26:08.109
So the Keating has no
chance with chef Brian.

26:08.109 --> 26:10.601
Thankfully just a couple
of hours after I saw him,

26:10.601 --> 26:12.468
Brian is back at the hotel.

26:12.468 --> 26:14.590
- After going to the hospital,

26:14.590 --> 26:18.787
I believe the Gordon
is totally in my corner

26:18.787 --> 26:21.605
saying, get back in there,
get it, you got this guy.

26:23.427 --> 26:25.168
- Now it's time to get
the whole staff together

26:25.168 --> 26:28.244
to figure out how to get
this hotel back on track.

26:28.244 --> 26:29.777
Thank you all for at meet me.

26:29.777 --> 26:31.059
Am I happy to see you or what?

26:31.059 --> 26:32.404
How are you feeling more importantly?

26:32.404 --> 26:33.510
- I am feeling very good.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.595
- Brilliant, welcome back.
- Thank you.

26:36.753 --> 26:37.899
- Let's get everything out on the table

26:37.899 --> 26:38.921
'cause life's too short to fester.

26:38.921 --> 26:39.790
I'm here to help

26:41.674 --> 26:43.999
and I just wanna hear it from you guys.

26:43.999 --> 26:46.408
What's wrong with the Keating?

26:46.408 --> 26:48.514
- The resources, is the resources.

26:48.514 --> 26:49.463
I tell Eddie all the time,

26:49.463 --> 26:52.059
Eddie, I can't do my job.

26:52.059 --> 26:55.323
- Your front reception desk
should not be doing laundry,

26:55.323 --> 26:56.588
let me tell you that.

26:58.524 --> 27:01.705
The big concern I have
is the room service.

27:01.705 --> 27:04.749
How on earth did we get
ourselves in that mess?

27:04.749 --> 27:06.261
As the food and beverage manager,

27:06.261 --> 27:10.005
they'll tell me why it's
going via the reception?

27:10.005 --> 27:11.850
- It's determined by you know, Eddie.

27:11.850 --> 27:13.518
- Oh my God, don't give me that.

27:14.780 --> 27:16.699
You're not the owner of the place.

27:16.699 --> 27:19.621
I tell you what I want and
you guys need to implement it.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.601
- Why is the menu so big?

27:23.601 --> 27:26.803
- Because Eddie comes up with ideas.

27:26.803 --> 27:27.991
Eddie sees things.

27:27.991 --> 27:29.576
Eddie has a lot of friends that come in

27:29.576 --> 27:32.058
that would like to see
more items on the menu.

27:32.058 --> 27:34.863
- Yeah, if I go see something
I like for somewhere else,

27:34.863 --> 27:36.656
I tell you guys to implement it

27:36.656 --> 27:39.044
- But you're not a chef, he is.

27:39.044 --> 27:41.932
And he needs his identity
and he needs his voice.

27:41.932 --> 27:44.383
- I do know Brian doesn't
like to say no to me.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.490
- You have a general manager,

27:47.490 --> 27:49.471
you have a head chef, executive chef,

27:49.471 --> 27:50.952
you have a front desk manager,

27:50.952 --> 27:52.630
you shouldn't get involved.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.862
- And I give them ideas, you know?

27:54.862 --> 27:57.135
'Cause I have a vision here
and I give them the ideas.

27:57.135 --> 27:58.004
- No.

27:59.095 --> 27:59.964
No.

28:01.003 --> 28:03.277
- I cannot work with
you if you're like this.

28:03.277 --> 28:04.785
We have the key players.

28:04.785 --> 28:07.781
There's one little problem we have

28:07.781 --> 28:10.701
and unfortunately, it's you at this point.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.382
(dramatic music)

28:15.382 --> 28:17.499
- After last night,
dramatic turn of events.

28:17.499 --> 28:19.183
Look at me, Jesus Christ.

28:19.183 --> 28:21.347
The staff at the Keating have
finally found the courage

28:21.347 --> 28:23.589
to confront Eddie, the owner.

28:23.589 --> 28:26.300
Now there's one question I have to ask,

28:26.300 --> 28:28.958
tell me, who's the most
important person at the Keating?

28:28.958 --> 28:29.827
Who is it?

28:31.190 --> 28:32.257
Eddie, Brian, yeah?

28:33.296 --> 28:34.568
The most important person at the Keating,

28:34.568 --> 28:35.437
Sandra, who is it?

28:35.437 --> 28:36.792
- I got to say it's Eddie.

28:37.762 --> 28:40.564
- I mean, I believe it would be Eddie.

28:40.564 --> 28:41.669
- Eddie?

28:41.669 --> 28:42.879
- Sandra.

28:42.879 --> 28:44.206
- No, no.

28:46.971 --> 28:50.487
The most important person
at the Keating is the guest.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.758
And I think it's all been forgotten about.

28:56.069 --> 28:59.179
And it's more about
keeping you, Eddie, happy.

29:02.096 --> 29:04.445
We have to focus on the guest.

29:06.475 --> 29:09.082
I'm here to put this place
right, understand that.

29:10.563 --> 29:13.096
Eddie and Sandra, just come with me.

29:13.096 --> 29:14.671
If Eddie won't listen to me

29:14.671 --> 29:16.423
and he won't listen to his staff,

29:16.423 --> 29:17.684
maybe he'll listen to the people

29:17.684 --> 29:19.707
who could pay the bills around here.

29:19.707 --> 29:20.666
Eddie, up until now,

29:20.666 --> 29:22.418
this hotel has always been about you,

29:22.418 --> 29:23.774
your dream, your vision.

29:23.774 --> 29:25.403
Now, it's about the guest.

29:26.380 --> 29:27.778
I want you to meet some
very important people.

29:27.778 --> 29:29.328
- I'm just really worried right now.

29:29.328 --> 29:32.532
I have no idea what
Gordon has in the room.

29:32.532 --> 29:34.884
- Hello, how are you?

29:34.884 --> 29:35.789
- Good.
- Fine.

29:35.789 --> 29:36.787
- Nice to see you.

29:36.787 --> 29:39.446
Guests that have been
staying at the Keating

29:39.446 --> 29:41.760
over the 24 to 48 hours.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.970
- Oh no.

29:42.970 --> 29:44.972
- When I see all those guests there,

29:44.972 --> 29:46.713
I want to run away right now.

29:46.713 --> 29:49.831
- I wanted to give you
a unique opportunity

29:49.831 --> 29:54.711
to hear some very and I
mean very valuable feedback.

29:54.711 --> 29:58.694
I've also stayed here and I am frustrated,

29:58.694 --> 30:01.801
but I'm here to get this
place back on the map.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.876
Give me your insights, please.

30:03.876 --> 30:05.910
What do you think of this luxury hotel?

30:06.796 --> 30:07.852
Madam, what you?

30:07.852 --> 30:10.998
- I walked into the room
and it smelled horrible.

30:10.998 --> 30:13.295
There was rust in the Jacuzzi, no water.

30:14.658 --> 30:16.827
- Some of the features in the
room were just lower quality,

30:16.827 --> 30:19.617
like the plastic looked a
little bit cheap and old.

30:19.617 --> 30:21.806
So it doesn't feel comfortable.

30:21.806 --> 30:22.906
- Madam, please.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.845
- I just feel like this place is designed

30:24.845 --> 30:26.899
kind of form over function.

30:26.899 --> 30:28.321
It was kind of weird.

30:29.318 --> 30:31.633
- Where's one supposed
to sit and eat breakfast

30:31.633 --> 30:33.281
in their room?

30:33.281 --> 30:35.001
My husband had to stand up this morning

30:35.001 --> 30:37.587
to have his breakfast
while I took the only chair

30:37.587 --> 30:38.995
and sat at the desk.

30:38.995 --> 30:40.434
- [Gordon] I'm sorry.

30:40.434 --> 30:41.855
- Our room service was,

30:42.811 --> 30:44.552
we ordered a couple of small pizzas

30:44.552 --> 30:46.753
and they essentially looked
like microwave pizzas

30:46.753 --> 30:47.858
and then the order was wrong.

30:47.858 --> 30:49.213
So we called to correct,

30:49.213 --> 30:51.351
they eventually you know brought
up what we actually ordered

30:51.351 --> 30:53.541
and then in the morning,
they charged us above.

30:53.541 --> 30:55.532
- [Gordon] Wow, I'm sorry, anybody else?

30:55.532 --> 30:57.305
- There was some really high end stuff

30:57.305 --> 30:58.347
and then at the same time,

30:58.347 --> 31:00.871
there was just simple
amenities that were skipped.

31:00.871 --> 31:01.945
- But are you saying there's better

31:01.945 --> 31:04.495
at the same price out there?

31:04.495 --> 31:05.625
- Yes.
- Sure.

31:06.939 --> 31:09.536
- Yeah, Eddie, your baby, your vision,

31:09.536 --> 31:10.794
on the back of that feedback.

31:10.794 --> 31:12.463
- No, I appreciate the feedback.

31:13.774 --> 31:16.063
- I have one question for you all,

31:16.063 --> 31:18.060
who would return here?

31:18.060 --> 31:20.875
Let's do a show of hands who
come back to the Keating.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.791
Wow, not one person

31:27.147 --> 31:29.712
- Gordon's comment about
it's not what I want,

31:29.712 --> 31:31.068
it's what the guests want.

31:31.068 --> 31:33.007
- Wow.
- I'm starting to realise

31:33.007 --> 31:35.690
that some of the things he's
saying actually are true.

31:36.907 --> 31:37.939
- I really apologise

31:37.939 --> 31:40.504
and I am looking forward to
having you guys in the future.

31:40.504 --> 31:43.392
I can tell you will have
a different experience

31:43.392 --> 31:46.917
- Eddie and Sandra, I'm not
trying to embarrass you,

31:46.917 --> 31:49.305
but this is for me critical feedback

31:49.305 --> 31:51.195
and it's only gonna get better.

31:52.589 --> 31:54.132
- The feedback from
the customers was good.

31:54.132 --> 31:56.489
I'm realising there's more
issues than I thought we had

31:56.489 --> 31:58.314
and just being here over
the past couple of days,

31:58.314 --> 31:59.346
I'm seeing what they are.

31:59.346 --> 32:01.463
I think we can definitely
fix them and streamline them

32:01.463 --> 32:03.131
so the place works a lot more efficiently

32:03.131 --> 32:04.549
and all the guests are happy.

32:04.549 --> 32:06.061
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

32:07.344 --> 32:09.700
Eddie is starting to see how
much things have to change

32:09.700 --> 32:11.121
for this place to succeed.

32:13.224 --> 32:14.809
But for the hotel to
have a fighting chance

32:14.809 --> 32:17.228
of turning a profit,
I've got to find a way

32:17.228 --> 32:19.877
to reignite chef Brian's love of cooking.

32:19.877 --> 32:21.264
Let's show the gang what we can do.

32:21.264 --> 32:25.038
- Yeah, I don't have much
passion here anymore.

32:25.038 --> 32:29.657
I'm hoping that Gordon being
here will nurse it back.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.420
- Right, first off was the roasted beet

32:31.420 --> 32:33.203
and burrata salad.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.071
They've just been seasoned

32:34.071 --> 32:35.591
with a little touch of salt, pepper,

32:35.591 --> 32:38.395
and then finished in a
little hazelnut vinegarette.

32:38.395 --> 32:42.525
Scallops, I like serving
scallops with a nice sear.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.474
So a touch of salt, pepper,
a little bit of vinaigrette.

32:44.474 --> 32:46.706
I've just made it sort of citrusy.

32:46.706 --> 32:47.574
- [Brian] Good sir.

32:47.574 --> 32:48.443
- I love it when you
get excited like that.

32:48.443 --> 32:51.823
It's the energy coming back
and I absolutely love it.

32:51.823 --> 32:53.163
We'll just have a little taste.

32:59.804 --> 33:01.543
Are you okay, Brian?

33:04.866 --> 33:06.058
- You're killing me.

33:06.058 --> 33:07.542
- There's two things on the plate.

33:07.542 --> 33:10.740
You've got the scallops
and the onion puree.

33:10.740 --> 33:12.565
- When I'm on the line with Gordon,

33:12.565 --> 33:16.100
the energy level just pops up and now I'm,

33:16.100 --> 33:20.333
you know, I'm standing a little
taller and it's exciting.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.911
- Nice, happy?

33:22.825 --> 33:24.483
Yeah, good, it's so
nice to see you smiling,

33:24.483 --> 33:25.714
you know that?

33:25.714 --> 33:27.809
- Gordon kind of unlocked the chains

33:27.809 --> 33:30.729
that I had allowed to be put on.

33:30.729 --> 33:32.940
- I'm with you every step of the way

33:32.940 --> 33:34.639
but you need a voice in here

33:34.639 --> 33:36.287
and your voice is on that plate.

33:36.287 --> 33:37.155
Let it scream.

33:38.226 --> 33:41.135
- I love Eddie but I have
to be able to just say,

33:41.135 --> 33:42.605
this is not going to work,

33:42.605 --> 33:45.369
this is not to the benefit
of the hotel, the guests,

33:45.369 --> 33:46.828
the restaurant or anything.

33:46.828 --> 33:48.956
- [Gordon] You can do it
and I know you can do it.

33:48.956 --> 33:53.147
- I needed this too
remember what I used to do

33:53.147 --> 33:57.008
and that there is no limit to
what I can do in the future.

34:02.459 --> 34:05.900
- Brian and Eddie are both
making great strides and tonight,

34:05.900 --> 34:07.221
my design team will move in

34:07.221 --> 34:09.851
and try to get this hotel out of the pits.

34:09.851 --> 34:13.072
But first, there's something
just got to try it.

34:13.072 --> 34:14.116
I've got a 25 grand bath,

34:14.116 --> 34:15.922
so I might as well use it.

34:15.922 --> 34:18.616
(bouncy music)

34:21.850 --> 34:25.324
(Jacuzzi bath rumbles)

34:29.328 --> 34:32.971
That does not feel or
sound like a 25 grand bath,

34:32.971 --> 34:35.699
let me tell you.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.869
Someone's been ripped off.

34:37.869 --> 34:39.407
Right, towel please.

34:39.407 --> 34:42.634
(woman screams)

34:42.634 --> 34:45.397
It's been a challenging
week at the Keating Hotel,

34:45.397 --> 34:48.295
a place that was all
style and no substance.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.945
But its owner Eddie has
finally turned a corner.

34:50.945 --> 34:52.290
Good morning.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.158
- Morning.
- Good morning.

34:53.158 --> 34:55.376
- How are you?
- Good, excellent.

34:55.376 --> 34:57.441
- It's time to show him and his staff

34:57.441 --> 34:59.776
how my design team have
transformed the Keating

34:59.776 --> 35:02.143
into a place people will
actually want to stay.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.864
Okay good, let's be honest,

35:03.864 --> 35:06.398
the Keating is a hotel
with huge potential, right?

35:06.398 --> 35:08.890
- Yes.
- But you need to focus

35:08.890 --> 35:10.905
your attention and energy to the guests

35:10.905 --> 35:12.873
that are staying here.

35:12.873 --> 35:14.458
Yeah?
- Yes.

35:14.458 --> 35:17.482
- Come with me, let me show
you the Keating, let's go.

35:17.482 --> 35:19.730
Come in, welcome.

35:19.730 --> 35:21.658
(lively music)

35:21.658 --> 35:23.948
- Wow, that is great.
- Come here.

35:23.948 --> 35:25.619
- [Sandra] Oh my God.

35:25.619 --> 35:27.088
- [Aaron] It's all opened up.

35:29.004 --> 35:32.444
- Wow, there's no more dominant red.

35:32.444 --> 35:33.925
- Read carefully.

35:33.925 --> 35:38.377
All those wonderful
configurations of your hands,

35:38.377 --> 35:41.342
Welcome to the Keating.

35:42.590 --> 35:44.665
- It's just so beautiful.
- Isn't it?

35:44.665 --> 35:47.042
- It's just such an emotional experience.

35:47.042 --> 35:51.495
- You all have a hand in
helping the guests feel welcome.

35:51.495 --> 35:52.412
- It's amazing.

35:52.412 --> 35:53.839
- [Gordon] You disappointed
the red is gone?

35:53.839 --> 35:55.718
- No, no.
- No?

35:55.718 --> 35:59.662
It's a brand new warm,
inviting entrance to a hotel.

36:00.671 --> 36:03.204
Ready to see more?
- Yeah.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.904
- Nice, nice, nice.

36:04.904 --> 36:06.044
Come into my suite.

36:08.585 --> 36:10.264
- Oh my God.
- Wow.

36:10.264 --> 36:12.200
- So much nicer.
- Oh wow.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.883
- [Sandra] Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

36:15.883 --> 36:18.595
Oh my God, I'm gonna cry.
- Wow.

36:18.595 --> 36:23.808
I am definitely blown away, wow.

36:24.152 --> 36:28.480
- welcome to what I
think is a sophisticated,

36:28.480 --> 36:31.462
comfortable, modern suite.

36:31.462 --> 36:33.975
Yeah, let's start off with that Jacuzzi.

36:33.975 --> 36:36.884
If guests would like to take a bath,

36:36.884 --> 36:39.042
pull the curtains, they have a choice.

36:39.042 --> 36:41.534
That's how you embody luxury.

36:41.534 --> 36:43.828
The sofas, you can sit down,

36:43.828 --> 36:45.820
you can watch TV

36:45.820 --> 36:48.124
three metres away from the screen.

36:48.124 --> 36:50.335
Brian, you've gone
quiet on me again, jeez.

36:50.335 --> 36:53.692
- We thought we were sleek and cool

36:53.692 --> 36:57.272
and now it's beautiful,
it feels welcoming.

36:58.572 --> 37:01.085
- Come through the bedroom please.

37:01.085 --> 37:03.744
- I really like concept
of the made over suit.

37:03.744 --> 37:05.298
Now it screams the guests.

37:05.298 --> 37:07.915
You get stuck in a perspective sometimes

37:07.915 --> 37:09.281
and we need to take a step back

37:09.281 --> 37:11.356
and have someone you
know come in and show you

37:11.356 --> 37:13.879
and I think that's what
Gordon has done, it's amazing.

37:13.879 --> 37:15.704
- Now something really important.

37:15.704 --> 37:18.519
I've organised a free trial period

37:18.519 --> 37:20.177
from a local linen company.

37:20.177 --> 37:21.522
Use it to advantage.

37:21.522 --> 37:22.409
That means that front desk team

37:22.409 --> 37:24.765
doesn't need to waste time doing laundry.

37:24.765 --> 37:26.788
You've got more time
to focus on the guests

37:28.571 --> 37:31.605
and Sandra, you are a GM,

37:31.605 --> 37:33.680
you're not a laundry assist

37:33.680 --> 37:35.213
- The lifestyle considers,

37:35.213 --> 37:37.090
we don't have to worry about laundry.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.741
So I am happy.

37:39.884 --> 37:41.188
- There's more, let's go.

37:43.597 --> 37:44.806
All right, excited?
- Yes.

37:44.806 --> 37:46.193
- Come through.

37:46.193 --> 37:48.414
We have refreshed the menu, okay?

37:48.414 --> 37:50.207
- [Sandra] Oh my God.

37:50.207 --> 37:52.386
- Wow, breakfast pizza.
- I've worked with chef Brian

37:52.386 --> 37:55.369
to devise a short new menu that
will play to his strengths.

37:55.369 --> 37:57.266
First impressions visually.

37:57.266 --> 37:58.580
- It's very vibrant.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.134
- The presentation's amazing.

38:00.134 --> 38:03.429
- And the good news is two
thirds of the menu's gone.

38:03.429 --> 38:05.128
Chef, what'd you think?

38:05.128 --> 38:08.204
- I think that this allows
me to speak to the guest.

38:08.204 --> 38:11.301
- And Aaron, I want you as
a food and beverage manager,

38:11.301 --> 38:13.689
take responsibility of room service.

38:13.689 --> 38:16.671
Own it and no plastic containers.

38:16.671 --> 38:18.715
- I think now we have
the proper education,

38:18.715 --> 38:20.456
the proper understanding of the menu.

38:20.456 --> 38:21.676
With limited smaller items,

38:21.676 --> 38:23.313
we definitely can execute it a lot quicker

38:23.313 --> 38:24.971
and now I feel a lot more comfortable.

38:24.971 --> 38:27.964
- And that for me is great news

38:27.964 --> 38:29.517
'cause it means the
front desk is no longer

38:29.517 --> 38:31.280
looking after room
service or doing laundry.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.698
They can concentrate
- Thank you.

38:32.698 --> 38:34.671
- on looking after the guests.

38:34.671 --> 38:35.622
- Yes.

38:35.622 --> 38:37.977
- There's one more change we need to do.

38:38.943 --> 38:42.040
You've be wearing a red chef
jacket for far too long.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.273
You deserve a white one, let me tell you.

38:45.273 --> 38:47.660
Put that on, enjoy it.
- Thank you.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.068
- I certainly will.

38:49.068 --> 38:50.445
I'm feeling great.

38:50.445 --> 38:54.490
I'm no longer Eddie's
chef in the red jacket.

38:54.490 --> 38:59.328
I'm the chef of the Merk Bistro in white.

38:59.328 --> 39:00.653
- It's not Eddie's favourite colour,

39:00.653 --> 39:03.520
but it is a proper chef jacket.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.886
YOu perform like one,

39:04.886 --> 39:07.138
you deserve it, make it yours.

39:07.138 --> 39:08.726
- Thank you, Gordon.
- Well done.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.748
- This is the kind of energy
you wanna see every day.

39:12.748 --> 39:13.760
So you know what?

39:13.760 --> 39:15.209
As long as they're doing their jobs,

39:15.209 --> 39:17.951
I have no problem with them
saying no to me anymore.

39:17.951 --> 39:18.820
- Big night tonight.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.391
There's gonna be a packed restaurant.

39:20.391 --> 39:24.134
You've got to remember
you're all team Keating.

39:24.134 --> 39:25.003
I know you can do it.

39:25.003 --> 39:26.814
- [Sandra] Oh absolutely, absolutely.

39:27.894 --> 39:31.486
(dramatic music)

39:31.486 --> 39:32.354
- [Gordon] Guests are arriving

39:32.354 --> 39:34.207
for the relaunch of the Keating hotel

39:35.135 --> 39:37.813
and the first impressions
are very positive.

39:37.813 --> 39:39.172
- This is really nice.

39:39.172 --> 39:40.447
- You like it?
- Oh yeah.

39:40.447 --> 39:42.173
- Oh this is beautiful.
- Whao.

39:42.173 --> 39:44.572
- At long last, the front desk can focus

39:44.572 --> 39:45.781
on welcoming guests.

39:45.781 --> 39:46.650
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

39:46.650 --> 39:49.104
- Welcome, I'm Cindy, pleasure to meet you

39:49.104 --> 39:50.828
- [Gordon] And the hotels new white lobby

39:50.828 --> 39:52.256
is a great improvement.

39:52.256 --> 39:53.125
- Wasn't this all red?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.519
and before it looked like a bus station,

39:54.519 --> 39:56.041
Now it looks like how
it looks like a hotel.

39:56.041 --> 39:58.367
It looks much more inviting.

39:58.367 --> 40:02.162
- [Gordon] At the restaurant,
Aaron is finally stepping up

40:02.162 --> 40:04.435
and taking a new hands on
approach to room service.

40:04.435 --> 40:05.304
Go on, go on, come on, quick.

40:05.304 --> 40:07.882
And not a plastic container in sight.

40:07.882 --> 40:10.796
(lively music)

40:10.796 --> 40:12.074
- Mr. Hanks, right?
- Yeah, hi.

40:12.074 --> 40:13.027
- Excellent, we've got room service

40:13.027 --> 40:14.831
over here for you.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.343
- [Gordon] The simplified menu has brought

40:16.343 --> 40:17.865
Brian back to life.

40:17.865 --> 40:21.139
- [Brian] I want the most
gorgeous plates in the world

40:21.139 --> 40:23.485
coming up in this window.

40:23.485 --> 40:24.872
- [Gordon] That's good
news for the diners.

40:24.872 --> 40:27.135
- So beautiful.
- It's very tender.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.855
It's like, I don't even need this knife.

40:28.855 --> 40:30.711
- This is a joint where
you don't need ketchup

40:30.711 --> 40:31.827
because it's perfectly seasoned.

40:31.827 --> 40:34.413
- And for the future of
Eddie and the Keating hotel.

40:34.413 --> 40:35.915
Keep it going.

40:35.915 --> 40:36.960
- That's amazing.

40:36.960 --> 40:40.430
- Look how tender that is.
- It's perfect.

40:40.430 --> 40:42.341
- If I had one thing to
say to Gordon right now,

40:42.341 --> 40:44.854
it's just thanks.

40:45.852 --> 40:49.428
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's our last ticket out.

40:49.428 --> 40:53.839
I've been really lost here
and you've woken me up.

40:53.839 --> 40:56.198
Great job, new day, new day.

40:57.342 --> 40:58.941
And reminded me of who I am.

41:06.101 --> 41:08.218
- This place was all about Eddie's dream

41:08.218 --> 41:10.731
of what a hotel should be like.

41:10.731 --> 41:14.477
But he forgot the most
important person, the guest.

41:15.517 --> 41:18.301
I'm just hoping that
Eddie can trust his staff

41:18.301 --> 41:20.042
and let them work as a team

41:20.042 --> 41:22.318
because this is a place
I'd love to come back to.

41:24.140 --> 41:27.435
Okay, right, Sandra,

41:27.435 --> 41:29.791
you are a great general manager.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.731
Don't stop being one, okay?

41:31.731 --> 41:33.690
- Gordon, thank you.

41:33.690 --> 41:35.084
Thank you so much, thank you so much.

41:35.084 --> 41:38.123
I'm proud to be the general
manager of the Keaton Hotel.

41:38.123 --> 41:39.085
- Give me a hug.

41:42.898 --> 41:44.035
Hey well done, seriously.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.223
You can do the food and beverage.

41:45.223 --> 41:47.747
You can handle the room service easily.

41:47.747 --> 41:50.927
And my God, I mean, you
bounce back from the dead

41:50.927 --> 41:52.016
let me tell you.
- Literally.

41:52.016 --> 41:53.471
- Literally.
- Yeah, literally.

41:53.471 --> 41:55.025
Make it yours, okay?
- Oh it is mine.

41:55.025 --> 41:59.050
- Well done and do not
change that jacket, okay?

41:59.050 --> 42:01.351
White suits you, you know that?

42:01.351 --> 42:04.712
And let your team run your business, okay?

42:04.712 --> 42:06.130
- I think this experience with Gordon

42:06.130 --> 42:08.153
was life-changing for everyone here.

42:08.153 --> 42:10.259
What you did to get
the team back together,

42:10.259 --> 42:12.227
I mean, I'm telling you,
no one could have done.

42:12.227 --> 42:15.139
- But this place is on
the road and good luck.

42:15.139 --> 42:16.411
I can't wait to come back.

42:16.411 --> 42:18.896
- It's one of those experiences
you'll never forget.

42:20.154 --> 42:21.023
- Good job, guys.

42:21.023 --> 42:22.290
- Sometimes you have to trust me.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.886
- No.
- No, no,

42:23.886 --> 42:24.755
no, no.

42:56.370 --> 42:59.151
- [Girl] One potato, two potato.
