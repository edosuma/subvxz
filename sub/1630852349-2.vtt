00:08.200 --> 00:12.520
[cheering]

00:12.600 --> 00:14.280
It's nice to be happy.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.360
[laughter]

00:15.440 --> 00:17.360
The world's awful at the minute, isn't it?

00:17.440 --> 00:19.240
How depressing is the world?

00:19.320 --> 00:22.040
Look at politics in this country.
The right are too right,

00:22.120 --> 00:24.480
and the left are too left.
None of them speak for us.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.320
It's ridiculous. "Brexit means Brexit."

00:27.400 --> 00:29.440
"I want my country back!"

00:29.520 --> 00:31.240
And over here it's just as bad.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.200
"What are we going
to call female fishermen?"

00:34.280 --> 00:35.640
[laughter]

00:37.400 --> 00:40.200
It's not your country. "Vaganglers."

00:40.280 --> 00:41.480
Can we not?

00:41.560 --> 00:42.760
[laughter]

00:42.840 --> 00:44.960
[applause]

00:45.040 --> 00:47.040
Discuss something that matters!

00:50.920 --> 00:52.120
Oh God.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.040
Greetings.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.360
This feels like the scene
where the murderer confesses.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.120
I haven't killed anyone, but I do have now

01:04.200 --> 01:06.880
the same amount of
Netflix specials as Ted Bundy.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.200
Have you seen the latest
social media trend?  Rib cage bragging,

01:11.280 --> 01:14.600
where supermodels lean back,
and they brag about their ribs.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.240
Now, I can't speak for women.
I can speak for every man

01:17.320 --> 01:20.800
who has ever walked the Earth.
No man has ever looked at a lady and gone,

01:20.880 --> 01:24.560
"Fucking look at the ribs on that!"

01:24.640 --> 01:25.680
[laughter]

01:25.760 --> 01:29.120
'Cause we're looking at you as women!
Not percussion instruments!

01:29.960 --> 01:32.240
We're not going to get in there and go…
[purring] "Oh yeah!"

01:32.320 --> 01:34.080
[purring] "Oh yeah!"

01:34.160 --> 01:35.120
[purring]

01:35.200 --> 01:37.920
[cheering and applause]

01:38.000 --> 01:40.800
[man] What was this documentary
supposed to be about?

01:40.880 --> 01:43.680
It was supposed to be about me

01:43.760 --> 01:45.520
doing a big world tour.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.080
Having done stand-up for 20 years.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.160
Just got married,

01:50.960 --> 01:52.080
was turning 40,

01:52.720 --> 01:53.800
and…

01:55.680 --> 01:57.200
Yeah. What was it about?

02:00.800 --> 02:03.560
[rock music playing]

02:22.480 --> 02:24.800
[announcer] Russell Howard!

02:24.880 --> 02:28.080
[rock music continues]

02:29.560 --> 02:30.720
There's that, "Yes!"

02:30.800 --> 02:33.320
The sort of elation as to why
you do it in the first place.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.600
[Russell yelling]

02:35.680 --> 02:37.680
You've beat both
Frank Sinatra and Barry Manilow

02:37.760 --> 02:40.400
for the record of the most
consecutive nights performed

02:40.480 --> 02:42.080
at the Royal Albert Hall.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.720
At the minute, I'm just a fucking machine
that is trying to create.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.600
I feel so out of touch
with everybody at the moment.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.680
Thank you from
the bottom of my heart for coming.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.560
A normal man like me shouldn't have fun…

03:11.040 --> 03:15.600
So that's what
it was meant to be about, but then

03:16.720 --> 03:18.320
bats got involved.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.440
In the past two weeks,

03:20.520 --> 03:24.280
the number of cases
of COVID-19 outside China

03:24.360 --> 03:26.800
has increased 13-fold.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.920
Good evening.

03:28.640 --> 03:33.480
The coronavirus is the biggest threat
this country has faced for decades.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.520
From this evening, I must give
the British people a simple instruction.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.120
You must stay at home.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.480
So my wife's a doctor

03:42.560 --> 03:46.600
and she planned
her first-ever career break.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.200
She was going to
come on tour with me to Europe,

03:50.280 --> 03:52.240
and America, and Australia.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.320
We'd even hired
Dolly Parton's tour van for a bit of it.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.800
But when COVID hit, my wife said,

04:01.560 --> 04:03.080
"I'm going to go back to work."

04:03.160 --> 04:07.040
"You're gonna stay with your parents,
'cause we don't know how bad it will be."

04:07.120 --> 04:11.400
"And then when it gets better,
you can come back."

04:11.920 --> 04:14.080
I finished my TV show

04:14.160 --> 04:19.040
on February 25th.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.240
That was the last show.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.840
-[cheering and applause]
-Hello!

04:22.360 --> 04:27.240
Thanks very much for watching the series!
We'll be back in autumn! Good night!

04:27.320 --> 04:29.800
Have a wonderful year! Farewell!

04:31.320 --> 04:36.720
I was doing shows
in Scandinavia, and Germany, and Holland.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.840
And Budapest, and Vienna, and Helsinki.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.040
Then I was doing a tour of America in May.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.240
Then July, I was going to Australia.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.760
Then in September,
I was going to Hammersmith in London.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.800
I was gonna record
the special for Netflix.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.400
That's the diary.
That's how it was all set out.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.520
Lovely like that.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.720
And that's all gone.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.320
I love my family,
but if you had told me in

05:08.080 --> 05:11.600
April 2019 that in a year's time,

05:11.680 --> 05:16.360
you'll be staying
with your parents as a 40-year-old man,

05:16.440 --> 05:18.640
sleeping in your childhood bed,

05:18.720 --> 05:21.240
and you won't be
allowed to leave the house…

05:24.080 --> 05:25.160
I'd be confused.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.520
I've learned that
my mom pretty much lives to embarrass me.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.520
-[woman whoops]
-We were in a car, on a motorway,

05:33.600 --> 05:34.520
stuck in traffic.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.000
This bloke got out of his car,
knocked on our window, and,

05:38.080 --> 05:39.200
"Can I have your photo?"

05:39.280 --> 05:41.360
-[laughter]
-That's fairly weird.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.920
It's made even weirder
when your mom goes, "Help!"

05:46.000 --> 05:48.080
[laughter]

05:48.160 --> 05:50.440
"He's kidnapped me!"

05:57.560 --> 05:58.880
Why are you wearing makeup?

05:58.960 --> 06:01.480
It's not that you knew
there was a camera coming?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.560
No, I didn't know!

06:02.640 --> 06:05.800
-Is he wearing mascara?
-Why don't you shave that tidy?

06:05.880 --> 06:07.080
I would ask the same of you.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.400
[Ninette giggling]

06:08.480 --> 06:10.920
[Russell]
My mom loves the fact that I do stand-up.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.360
She'll come to the same show
20 times in a row and still laugh.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.960
I'm like, "You've seen it."

06:17.240 --> 06:18.560
"Yeah, but I forget."

06:19.520 --> 06:21.040
[man] Does he like you putting them up?

06:21.120 --> 06:23.840
No, he didn't say,
"I want to put the pictures."

06:23.920 --> 06:25.240
He said, "I'm not a shrine."

06:26.320 --> 06:27.680
Should we put them out?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.240
I mean, they're wonderful.

06:36.040 --> 06:41.320
This is a painting I did of him years ago.
In my kitchen years ago.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.000
He hates it, of course.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.360
[Ninette giggling]

06:45.440 --> 06:47.440
I mean, it's just creepy, innit?

06:47.960 --> 06:49.320
Who paints their son?

06:51.400 --> 06:54.040
My relationship with my mom has changed.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.320
When I was young,
we used to watch TV together,

06:58.400 --> 07:00.640
because Dad was away working.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.560
So I would kind of…
I became her sort of husband.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.840
[Ninette] I remember, because he was
a little bit older than Daniel and Kerry,

07:08.920 --> 07:10.640
I would let him stay up later.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.160
He would make me a cup of tea.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.560
He would bring it in
on a tray and be so pleased

07:16.640 --> 07:20.080
that he had that special time
to be able to sit down.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.000
I think we watched Coronation Street.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.640
Something silly like that.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.200
But he could make me a cup of tea,

07:26.280 --> 07:28.960
and do that, and he liked that.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.600
Sometimes, I could push it
to nine o'clock.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.480
Then she'd suddenly come to
and realize I wasn't her husband.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.720
I was a child that needed to go to bed.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.400
I think Dad's got a job for you today.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.600
Good luck with that. I'm leaving in a bit.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.320
[Ninette giggling]

07:45.400 --> 07:47.120
Should we lift it like that?
That's easier.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.600
-How do you mean?
-As in, across like that?

07:49.680 --> 07:51.960
No, because we've got
to get up the stairs.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.080
[Russell] I'm funny because of my mom,
and I'm determined because of my dad.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.280
The thing is, I love my dad.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.520
I think he… And I really respect him.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.280
Nobody has drive like my dad, nobody.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.080
My career has had a big impact
on my relationship with my dad

08:16.160 --> 08:20.360
because I think my dad…
I was going to say I think he respects me.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.480
I don't think he does.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.720
I always tell him after every gig,

08:24.240 --> 08:26.400
in a completely sincere way,

08:27.000 --> 08:28.800
that he's brilliant.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.080
I might not use
those words, but it will be

08:32.720 --> 08:35.320
flavors of excellent, fantastic.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.000
So he's had plenty of cues.

08:38.080 --> 08:41.080
If that's still in his head,
then he needs to talk to somebody.

08:41.160 --> 08:43.520
That's his own demons then, isn't it?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.760
What about moving the stuff in the shed?

08:45.840 --> 08:46.720
Leg it.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.360
[Dave] He must know

08:50.040 --> 08:52.200
how much we appreciate his ability.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.240
I wouldn't say…
I just think he's fabulous.

09:00.240 --> 09:05.720
[Russell] What Dad's very good at is,
if there's somebody he wants to impress,

09:05.800 --> 09:09.040
he really can, but I don't think
he's ever wanted to impress me.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.120
There's no need to have a conversation.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.480
Do you know what I mean?
Why would you try and

09:15.040 --> 09:17.320
impress something
that used to live in your balls?

09:18.320 --> 09:20.000
That's kind of how I felt.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.800
Whereas my mom would happily
have me right back in her fanny.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.880
[Russell sniggers]

09:29.080 --> 09:32.240
[upbeat pop music plays]

09:34.400 --> 09:36.160
[Ninette] Russell thought of it first.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.000
[Russell] So I'm the oldest,
and then I've got

09:39.080 --> 09:41.600
a brother and sister
who were two years younger than me.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.880
They're twins,
and they have nothing in common.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.360
He hated these two babies because

09:47.440 --> 09:51.840
they took his little starship out.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.400
But then he got over that,
and I think he took to Daniel,

09:56.040 --> 09:57.960
because he was a boy

09:58.040 --> 09:59.560
and they did boy things together.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.600
And that was…
Kerry was always tagging along.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.480
She was always, like, the goalie.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.000
[woman] He got Daniel with the football.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.440
And so then I was...
It was just me and my mirror.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.560
[Kerry laughing]

10:13.640 --> 10:16.400
Didn't really care what Kerry was up to.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.440
All I ever wanted to do was have
a game of footie with Russ, really.

10:19.520 --> 10:24.120
If she'd been any good at footie,
then happy days. But she wasn't,

10:24.880 --> 10:26.160
so gotta fall on your sword.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.640
Nobody makes me laugh
more than my brother.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.560
Women hate him.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.480
He's really funny,
but he's not dinner-party funny.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.760
He's Wetherspoons funny.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.080
[laughter]

10:37.920 --> 10:39.480
That's me and my brother,

10:39.560 --> 10:40.440
topless.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.880
That's me with me old teeth.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.280
That's him with cheekbones,
before he turned into such a fat fuck.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.680
[bell dings]

10:48.280 --> 10:51.280
I'd certainly say
I was a useful pet for him.

10:51.360 --> 10:55.000
As in, "We could jump over that fence."

10:55.720 --> 10:58.360
"Do you want to jump over first
and see if you hurt your leg?"

10:58.440 --> 10:59.880
[man] You're live now.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.600
Hello.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.480
[Russell] So Daniel's got epilepsy,
and what's awful about it is that

11:06.560 --> 11:09.520
I know when it happened,
because we were riding our bikes

11:09.600 --> 11:13.280
down a hill, and a battery fell out of my…

11:15.400 --> 11:19.160
light on the back of my bike.
It sort of flicked.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.320
I looked around. It went…

11:20.400 --> 11:21.880
[cracking sound]
Like that.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.760
Daniel went like that over the battery.
[whooshing sound]

11:24.840 --> 11:27.840
Crack! He smacked his head,
and was on the floor.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.560
It was obviously before
the days of helmets and all this shit.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.120
I was like, "Oh God, he's dead."

11:34.560 --> 11:36.400
[man] Out the way, Russell!
Move your big head.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.480
He obviously hurt himself,
but he didn't go to hospital.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.840
No, he just went to the doctor's.
She cleaned him up, and he was fine.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.760
Know that bone
that goes all the way down there?

11:49.920 --> 11:51.440
-[man] What, the spine?
-Yeah.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.800
[man] Think it's done any damage?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.400
And then a week later,
he's upstairs with Kerry.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.000
I went into his room,
and he was staring into space.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.200
He stared through me. He wasn't there.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.320
She's like, "Russell, Russell!"

12:04.400 --> 12:06.840
I run upstairs,
and my brother's just like this.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.360
You know, and he starts fitting.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.360
It's fucking horrendous.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.360
-I was hugging him like he was gonna die.
-He was in a terrible state.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.680
So I thought this was it.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.080
After about three minutes
of watching him just go bluer and bluer,

12:26.160 --> 12:29.760
in that three minutes, I thought
I was holding my boy for the last time.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.920
Dad was crying.
It's the only time I've ever seen him cry.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.960
It was absolutely horrific.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.680
Whenever the events would happen,

12:36.760 --> 12:38.080
you weren't there.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.960
They were the victims.
They had to witness it and deal with it.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.720
All I was doing was,
you'd have the seizure, wake up, and go,

12:46.280 --> 12:47.520
"What's going on here?"

12:47.600 --> 12:50.600
It was funny,
because we were around Daniel

12:50.680 --> 12:52.720
and he was unconscious.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.120
Then he just sat up, looked at us,

12:55.200 --> 12:57.200
and he farted.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.960
[laughing] And then, it was just,
everyone was laughing.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.160
That's almost a perfect example
of the power of comedy

13:03.240 --> 13:05.560
because we were broken as a family.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.600
Like we thought we were going to lose

13:08.680 --> 13:10.040
the best of us.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.960
Daniel was the best.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.920
And he comes round
after this horrific ordeal

13:16.440 --> 13:19.480
and farts for such…

13:20.000 --> 13:21.440
It was a proper like…

13:21.520 --> 13:24.320
[squeaky sound]

13:25.640 --> 13:27.400
And everyone smiled.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.440
That's why comedy's
such an amazing tool for navigating life.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.120
If you can find laughter in pain,
you can kind of get through anything.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.840
So the pandemic happened,

13:51.920 --> 13:53.280
the tour was canceled,

13:53.360 --> 13:56.520
and I was basically sent to my room.

13:57.720 --> 14:01.640
[upbeat music playing]

14:01.720 --> 14:05.320
Hello, and welcome to my bedroom.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.520
While I was in my bedroom,
I did a TV show for Sky.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.320
The show was me doing some topical jokes,
chatting to other comedians.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.840
You're the highlight of my entire fucking…
three months it feels like I've been here.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.400
[Russell yelling]

14:20.840 --> 14:25.960
Congratulations for being the first person
to get me to put trousers on for a month.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.320
We'd get musicians
to perform from their home.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.400
♪ …We're in lockdown
Please don't cough around me ♪

14:32.480 --> 14:33.520
♪ Keep your salivas ♪

14:34.600 --> 14:37.560
And I interviewed people
who were doing amazing things.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.880
They are underpaid,
and still on the front line.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.160
I keep saying, moving forward,
when this nightmare is over,

14:45.240 --> 14:48.360
we should have a national discussion
of how we treat our working class,

14:48.440 --> 14:51.600
and how we treat people,
like the NHS staff.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.000
Obviously, my wife
is one of those amazing people,

14:55.080 --> 15:00.040
but we have a rule that
she doesn't want to be in this world.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.360
That's why she's not going to
be in this documentary.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.920
She does exist, by the way.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.960
I did talk to
one of her friends who's a doctor.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.840
That was a lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.680
At the end of all of this, I don't know

15:14.760 --> 15:17.960
how many people will have lost
their lives, and been seriously affected.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.960
But I would presume that
the least somebody wants to do

15:21.040 --> 15:23.880
is be able to look back and say,
well, they did their best.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.400
Your best is following the advice.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.440
-Please do it.
-Yeah.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.520
You've actually made me
feel emotional there, because that's…

15:33.920 --> 15:36.040
That is exactly… We should fess up.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.000
You're best friends with my wife.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.920
And that's exactly what you're both doing,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.760
is that you're completely doing your best.

15:44.840 --> 15:49.200
It's quite… The thing I find typical,
watching the news,

15:49.280 --> 15:54.040
is when you see
the doctors covered in all the PPE stuff.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.520
And to think that someone you love

15:58.600 --> 16:02.600
is day in, day out,
putting themselves at risk

16:02.680 --> 16:05.920
to save others is utterly humbling.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.560
This was really early on,
when people didn't know the situation,

16:09.640 --> 16:11.400
other than the fact
that people were dying.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.000
You know, he felt like
he was needed to do something.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.800
[James] This was as close
as he could get to doing stand-up.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.880
He had so much downtime.
What was he gonna do?

16:20.960 --> 16:23.200
[Daniel] All he'd been doing
is talking to his dog.

16:23.280 --> 16:27.560
It was all right,
performing in your bedroom, but

16:28.240 --> 16:30.560
it's nothing compared to stand-up.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.280
Honestly, I was so desperate to gig again,

16:35.360 --> 16:36.600
so desperate.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.400
I'm deeply, deeply missing stand-up,

16:40.480 --> 16:42.160
so much, just…

16:43.400 --> 16:44.840
Yeah, I have a mic,

16:45.320 --> 16:49.080
that isn't even plugged in,
but even holding it, like it…

16:49.600 --> 16:52.800
It's something about
the coldness of it as well.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.920
It just sort of makes sense.
You know what I mean?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.480
Just holding it there.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.880
Just feeling a mic on your chin.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.160
[Russell sighing]

17:02.240 --> 17:04.880
It's something really quite satisfying.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.200
I mean, this is definitely going to be…

17:07.280 --> 17:10.480
Someone's going to photoshop this out,
and there will be a cock.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.640
It will have this cock
repeatedly slapping me in the face.

17:14.720 --> 17:19.520
But what I wouldn't give
at the minute to be at a comedy club,

17:20.120 --> 17:23.160
talking through ideas, you know?

17:25.120 --> 17:27.160
Thank God gigs came back.

17:28.800 --> 17:29.840
-[woman] Hello!
-Hi.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.040
-[man] Russell!
-How you doing? You all right?

17:33.120 --> 17:35.240
-[man] How's it going?
-Hello. You all right?

17:35.320 --> 17:38.400
-How's things? Sweet. Yeah, good.
-[man] Not too bad.

17:43.280 --> 17:46.240
[Russell] The only pernickety thing
is it's slightly windy.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.400
Is there not a way,
or is that one of the provisos,

17:48.480 --> 17:49.440
it has to be open?

17:50.160 --> 17:52.480
For COVID reasons,
the sides have to be open.

17:52.560 --> 17:57.840
You need 75% of it open,
or it's classed as an indoor space.

17:57.920 --> 17:58.920
Fine, fine, fine.

17:59.680 --> 18:04.240
I've done gigs in woods, lay-bys.
I'm doing a gig now in a tent.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.000
Like, it's really changed.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.480
It's what you're saying about humanity.
That's the link with all this.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.640
-People just want to fucking laugh.
-Yeah.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.600
So we've done
Thursday, Friday, Saturday here,

18:17.680 --> 18:20.800
and the overwhelming comment from people

18:21.720 --> 18:23.240
is, "Thank you."

18:23.320 --> 18:27.040
[Jarred] Usually, on a comedy night,
no one comes up and says, "Thank you."

18:27.120 --> 18:31.440
Good evening, everybody!
Welcome along to the Rode Comedy Festival

18:31.520 --> 18:34.640
on a Saturday night,
you lucky bastards! Yes!

18:34.720 --> 18:37.680
Being a comedian in 2020

18:38.240 --> 18:41.000
is like trying to make
a sculpture out of shit,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.960
and the world won't stop shitting.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.160
-Did you guys have a good break?
-[audience] Yeah.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.560
Good interval. What did you think?

18:47.640 --> 18:49.480
After the break.
Give it a number out of ten.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Ten out of ten?

18:51.080 --> 18:54.800
Did you get fingered?
Ten out of ten? My God!

18:54.880 --> 18:57.720
Please welcome to the stage,
the brilliant Russell Howard!

18:57.800 --> 18:59.680
[cheering and applause]

19:00.480 --> 19:02.440
[man whooping]

19:02.520 --> 19:03.360
Sorry.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.120
I got fingered during the break.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.200
[laughter]

19:10.400 --> 19:11.880
I was just doing my shoe up.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.240
We all have this thing.
We all had a lockdown moment

19:17.320 --> 19:19.200
where we were like, "I've gone."

19:20.000 --> 19:21.880
"I'm not well anymore. I'm not here."

19:22.640 --> 19:25.000
You're all thinking of yours now going,

19:25.080 --> 19:26.560
"Yeah, we did do that."

19:26.640 --> 19:30.160
[Russell] I had all this new stuff
that I'd never said.

19:30.240 --> 19:34.520
I'd only ever written it down,
and until that point, it's not jokes.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.760
It's just predictions

19:37.840 --> 19:39.480
and speculation.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.320
And then you say them,
and the crowd laugh.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.160
And they… you literally…

19:44.240 --> 19:47.400
It's like watching
babies being born in front of you.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.640
And like watching babies die.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.880
That's what it's like. You're literally
throwing kids out, and it's like…

19:54.960 --> 19:55.800
[groaning]

19:55.880 --> 19:57.800
And then he manages to fly away.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.040
Then one of them just doesn't make it.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.760
The fucking crowd stamp on him.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.840
You're like, "Whoa! That's my baby!"
You pick him up, dust him down.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.920
You go, "We'll go again tomorrow."

20:08.000 --> 20:10.920
You put that baby in a suitcase,
and you go to the next gig.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.400
And then, he's bruised.
He's tattered. You try him.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.880
He gets a kicking again.
Then you try him the third time,

20:17.960 --> 20:19.600
and he's beginning to walk.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.720
Then, sixth, seventh, or eighth gig,

20:22.800 --> 20:25.760
you either go, "You're gonna be a baby,"

20:25.840 --> 20:29.040
or you just have to take him
out back and shoot him in the face.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.040
As fun as that gig was,

20:32.320 --> 20:36.120
it's hard to ignore
that literally a year earlier,

20:36.200 --> 20:40.160
I was doing a gig
in front of 16,000 people and

20:40.840 --> 20:42.920
there is no comparison.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.800
One, two. One, two.
Yeah, so holding it down there.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.280
One, two. One, two.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.000
One, two, three, four, five.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.800
I am the greatest rapper alive.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.320
Let's get in that triangle of trust again.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.160
See? It just gets everyone going!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.800
It's really funny.
Everyone's got their own little routine.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.960
I'm pretty normal, but,

21:16.160 --> 21:19.480
with stand-up,
I have to have my food at a certain time,

21:19.560 --> 21:23.120
and then, you know,
I have to be around the same people.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.840
We sort of hang out
and dick about, and it's that

21:26.440 --> 21:29.360
dicking around, or looking at your notes,

21:29.440 --> 21:30.840
just being silly.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.680
That is so calming
before you do a big show.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.200
You might want to move your laptop,
'cause I'm going to bend it in.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.000
-[crashing]
-[man] Oh!

21:40.080 --> 21:42.400
-Oh, fuck. You okay?
-Yeah.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.760
-You all right?
-I think so.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.160
Pete, we need to get
different fingerprints on the front.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.520
[Russell] Kumar is the greatest.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.480
The mighty Kumar Kamalagharan.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.280
He literally creates a gig.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.400
It's like, if I'm a footballer,

21:57.480 --> 22:01.240
he's the man that sorts the kit,

22:02.040 --> 22:03.080
gets the boots,

22:03.680 --> 22:05.200
gets a team to play,

22:05.280 --> 22:06.760
mows the lawn,

22:06.840 --> 22:08.960
hires somebody to do the announcement,

22:09.040 --> 22:11.120
gets the music sorted,

22:11.200 --> 22:13.960
gets a ref, does everything.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.320
Then everyone goes, "Bloody hell,
you played really well tonight."

22:17.400 --> 22:19.000
You're like, "Guess I did."

22:20.000 --> 22:22.360
As things have developed over the years,

22:22.440 --> 22:24.480
I mean, I would say that we're kind of…

22:25.760 --> 22:27.480
Well, we're travel companions.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.560
You know, we kind of eat together,

22:30.640 --> 22:33.120
chat, travel, and drink.

22:33.720 --> 22:38.040
All the other things that are
actually the fun part of being on tour.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.440
Are we able to watch the football?

22:43.240 --> 22:45.640
[football crowd cheering]

22:50.400 --> 22:52.400
Yes!

22:54.000 --> 22:55.480
It's a normal Sunday.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.520
Eating a Sunday dinner

22:59.280 --> 23:01.720
as we watch football in an arena.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.360
It's absolute madness.

23:06.920 --> 23:10.560
You never take for granted
how insane it is

23:10.640 --> 23:12.680
to play to that many people a night,

23:12.760 --> 23:14.400
because you know

23:15.240 --> 23:17.000
how long it took to get there.

23:17.520 --> 23:21.520
And you know all the little gigs
you did that led up to that moment.

23:30.760 --> 23:31.880
[cheering]

23:31.960 --> 23:36.760
Welcome to the stage, Russell Howard!

23:43.200 --> 23:45.200
It's like learning sex again.

23:45.280 --> 23:49.520
Every time you try out new material,
it's like, "Do you like it like that?"

23:49.600 --> 23:52.200
Once you know your show. "Yeah, fucking…"

23:52.280 --> 23:55.040
[singing confidently]

23:56.560 --> 23:58.240
I was here, like, "Yeah."

23:59.520 --> 24:01.400
"Did you like that or not? Make a noise."

24:01.480 --> 24:03.240
[laughter]

24:03.320 --> 24:05.800
The fun part
is when he's creating the show.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.680
It's different every night.
It's a lot more relaxed.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.200
It's so much fun.

24:11.280 --> 24:15.320
If he's doing an arena tour,
he'll have already done a full tour

24:15.400 --> 24:17.880
of small art centers
and little theaters and things.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.920
I'll go to London.
I'll do two or three shows a night.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.120
I'll then go to Bristol, or Manchester.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.040
To be honest, I'll go anywhere.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.760
Not anywhere. You know, within reason.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.000
I've turned down weddings.
I'm not doing that.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.160
It's a strange time,
'cause you have good gigs.

24:35.240 --> 24:39.080
That's exactly what I'm saying about
that thing where you go, "It's alive!"

24:39.160 --> 24:42.280
And you have bad gigs. Like, bad.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.320
[cheering]

24:44.400 --> 24:46.960
Hey! One long cheer!

24:47.840 --> 24:49.920
When you're writing a show,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.400
you're just trying to find patterns.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.760
Like, what's going on in the world?

24:56.520 --> 24:58.320
What's going on in my life?

24:58.400 --> 25:01.680
The big thing in my life is,
I'm getting married, which is exciting.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.280
[cheering]

25:03.360 --> 25:04.320
Thank you.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.560
People often say,
when did you know it was love?

25:08.640 --> 25:10.840
And when I say "people," I mean girls.

25:10.920 --> 25:11.760
[laughter]

25:12.360 --> 25:16.520
Absolutely, the show
is the most important thing.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.520
And that's all.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.440
[Kumar] He sets an extremely high bar.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.000
Sometimes it's unreasonably high.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.600
[Russell] People have paid
good money for a night out,

25:25.680 --> 25:28.560
and there's nowhere to hide, really.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.320
When you get to those big shows,

25:30.400 --> 25:32.640
it's got to be tight,

25:32.720 --> 25:36.440
so when you're in an arena,
and there's 15,000 people,

25:36.520 --> 25:39.800
you've got to be certain about that bit,

25:39.880 --> 25:43.560
that if someone throws you a curveball,
you can bend out of it.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.560
-So scary.
-[man] Russell!

25:45.640 --> 25:46.520
Yes, mate?

25:46.600 --> 25:49.840
[man shouts question]

25:49.920 --> 25:51.960
Propose?

25:52.640 --> 25:53.520
In a minute.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.680
[cheering and laughing]

25:54.760 --> 25:56.600
You might've slightly given the game away.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.840
"I've got a secret. I'm going to ask her

26:00.920 --> 26:02.360
to marry me!"

26:04.400 --> 26:06.000
Russell has no

26:07.360 --> 26:08.680
gauge about good.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.600
He just has a gauge about exceptional,

26:11.680 --> 26:17.000
which is… the perfection is cursed,
because nine and a half out of ten

26:17.640 --> 26:18.600
is not ten.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.360
That means it's crap.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.160
-He takes after you for that, doesn't he?
-Possibly.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.960
As much as it's painful,
that energy of "Fuck me."

26:27.040 --> 26:28.720
"They fucking hated me."

26:28.800 --> 26:32.080
I've got to figure out
how to make people not hate that bit,

26:32.160 --> 26:33.800
rather than going, "It was all right,"

26:33.880 --> 26:36.400
because then it will always
only if ever be all right.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.120
[Dave] He had all the cards, really.
He's a good-looking boy.

26:44.640 --> 26:45.880
He's not stupid.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.120
He can play all the sports under the sun.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.400
Plus he was gobby.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.920
[laughing]

26:54.000 --> 26:55.840
[man] Russell, somebody said you smiled.

26:55.920 --> 26:56.760
Is that right?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.240
I was good at football.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.000
And my dad, like most dads,
would go, "Give it easy!"

27:04.080 --> 27:06.880
"Just play it!"
My dad would literally stand on the side.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.480
I really vividly remember this.
I'm like 14.

27:09.560 --> 27:13.080
And my dad goes,
"You gonna do any flash shit, or what?"

27:13.600 --> 27:15.680
[Dave] When I look back now,

27:15.760 --> 27:19.240
I can see the roots
of his career when he was a ten-year-old.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.480
The kids would mess about,
but Russell was the first with a line.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.240
Always the quickest.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.440
When I first started stand-up,
I didn't want to be like

27:27.520 --> 27:31.000
a bitter old man going,
"Oh God, I wish I had done that."

27:31.600 --> 27:34.440
So I just thought, "Right, bollocks."

27:34.520 --> 27:37.880
"I'm going to go for it."
So I went and did a gig when I was 18.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.120
And honestly,
it was like the world changed.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.480
It was like suddenly,
the world became Technicolor.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.000
I started when I was 18.
I did my first-ever gig,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.320
and I really wanted
to do stand-up from about 14.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.560
So I used to write jokes,
and then went and did a gig.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.720
And the world is full of, kind of,

27:57.800 --> 28:01.240
"He won't be able to do that.
"There's no way." Everyone is negative.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.960
So I just didn't tell anybody.
I used to just wander off,

28:05.040 --> 28:06.880
and do these gigs in Bristol.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.760
There was a place called Virgin Mirth,
and I used to go there every Thursday.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.560
I would try out my little jokes,
and it gradually became a thing.

28:14.640 --> 28:18.240
Mom was delighted
'cause she thought I was a serial killer.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.720
I felt like I had stumbled on this…

28:21.520 --> 28:24.640
It's like a mechanism
through which you can do life.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.440
I certainly went to the first gig,
and the first number of gigs.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.760
Fairly seamless for him, I reckon.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.120
As if he'd been doing it all the time.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.600
This time, you're not
the boy on the bus saying the stories.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.920
You're just on a different platform.
The same old shit, right?

28:40.520 --> 28:42.800
There was a big gap between

28:44.080 --> 28:47.960
that first gig in Bath,

28:48.640 --> 28:51.720
and then him getting
his first break on TV.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.600
-Yeah.
-Probably about four years.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.760
Where he would drive
up and down the country in a little

28:58.400 --> 28:59.520
beat-up old car.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.440
[Ninette] Fiesta.

29:00.960 --> 29:04.600
[Dave] Not even covering his petrol.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.680
Gradually building up a fan base,

29:06.760 --> 29:08.640
but it was graft.

29:08.720 --> 29:12.920
He must used to go miles and miles,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.280
then drive back.

29:14.360 --> 29:19.040
He would come in an unearthly hour,
like three o'clock in the morning.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.080
-He couldn't afford to stay anywhere.
-Yeah.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.160
And then he was like--

29:24.240 --> 29:26.240
The fridge was vulnerable, wasn't it?

29:26.320 --> 29:28.000
Then he would say to me,

29:28.080 --> 29:32.160
on a day, he'd say,
"Do you need anything down at the shop?"

29:32.240 --> 29:36.360
And I'd go, "I do.
I need to get milk or bread," or whatever.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.720
"I'll drive you to Tesco if you'd like."
I'd go, "Oh, all right then."

29:39.800 --> 29:44.600
He'd drive me to Tesco,
pull out of the petrol station, he'd go,

29:44.680 --> 29:45.920
"I need some petrol."

29:46.000 --> 29:48.120
I said, "I'll put some in for you."

29:48.200 --> 29:49.880
-He'd fill up to the brim.
-[Dave laughing]

29:49.960 --> 29:52.000
He didn't have no money,

29:52.080 --> 29:55.920
and I'd think, "I've done this again.
You've done it again to me."

29:56.440 --> 29:58.320
I was working at the RAC,

29:58.400 --> 29:59.720
and Dad made me quit.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.080
I was working part-time, and he was like,

30:02.160 --> 30:04.840
"Go for it for a year.
I'll give you a year."

30:04.920 --> 30:08.360
"If it isn't going anywhere,
then walk away and do something else."

30:08.440 --> 30:09.920
So I said to him, "Look."

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
"Why don't you dedicate
yourself 100% to comedy?"

30:14.080 --> 30:18.320
"Let's see what happens.
Don't compromise between comedy and work."

30:18.400 --> 30:24.640
I literally got signed by my agent
with three days to go of my allotted year.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.360
If at the time he'd said,

30:26.440 --> 30:29.840
"Can you let me know quickly?
My dad's given me another three days."

30:29.920 --> 30:32.440
I think that would have been weird.
That would've been weird.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.720
I would've responded to it,
but it might've put me off a bit.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.920
Jodie Marsh, who is famous
for reasons best known to Jodie,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.520
She's on every single page,
pointing her breasts.

30:42.600 --> 30:46.120
They have a similar thing in Italy,
only it's called "Match of the Day."

30:46.200 --> 30:47.880
[laughter]

30:47.960 --> 30:49.960
It's ridiculous. I was watching football.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.320
Actually, this would be like
Jimmy Hill or Gary Lineker.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.800
"Hi. Do ya like football?"

30:57.320 --> 31:00.440
"Do you like me? Enjoy the game."

31:00.520 --> 31:02.560
Then you settle down. The game's on.

31:02.640 --> 31:03.480
"That's fine."

31:03.560 --> 31:05.920
Every so often, she pops up.
"It's a good game, isn't it?"

31:06.000 --> 31:07.760
-[laughter]
-"Yeah!"

31:09.040 --> 31:11.120
You can't cross sex and football.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.120
It's impossible to concentrate.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.520
I went to see him,

31:16.240 --> 31:17.920
I think in 2003,

31:19.040 --> 31:22.160
on the strength of a recommendation
from John Oliver.

31:22.760 --> 31:25.120
You know, it might have been one of those

31:25.640 --> 31:28.960
student network gigs,
where you go to a university

31:29.040 --> 31:32.280
to try and entertain

31:32.960 --> 31:36.400
a group of
disgracefully drunk 18-year-olds.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.120
And I think,

31:40.040 --> 31:45.640
I think what I was impressed by
with Russell was his ability

31:45.720 --> 31:48.280
to play ringmaster to a chaotic room

31:50.160 --> 31:53.320
without kind of instigating a riot.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.520
He had all the ingredients,

31:56.880 --> 32:01.520
including a love of stand-up,
and a real work ethic

32:01.600 --> 32:03.440
to be very good very quickly.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.320
I guess everyone says this,
but I feel like I was part of

32:07.400 --> 32:09.400
a golden generation, really.

32:09.480 --> 32:13.720
Because I got to support Daniel Kitson

32:13.800 --> 32:18.680
when I was very young, who's probably
still the best comedian in the UK,

32:18.760 --> 32:21.000
one of the best in the world,
one of the greats.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.360
I got to support John Oliver,

32:23.440 --> 32:30.120
who's gone on to become
this massive satirical genius in America.

32:30.200 --> 32:33.600
Then I was in a flat with Jon Richardson,

32:33.680 --> 32:35.240
who's all over TV here,

32:35.320 --> 32:38.480
John Robins, who's all over radio.
He's brilliant.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.240
Mark Olver, who's one of the best comperes
in the country.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.960
And we had the marvelous Wil Hodgson,

32:46.040 --> 32:48.680
who is unlike
any human being I've ever met.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.720
-I wouldn't mind having a trim.
-Yeah? What do you want doing?

32:53.280 --> 32:54.800
[Russell laughing]

32:54.880 --> 32:59.080
-What are you doing with this?
-I'd like this just shaved, if I may.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.720
-Have you got a cutthroat?
-Yeah.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.120
-Fuck me!
-Do it all the time.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.880
-Do you? Wow.
-Do it every day.

33:03.960 --> 33:06.640
Will used to wear makeup, a pink mohawk,

33:06.720 --> 33:08.680
and loads of Care Bear tattoos.

33:08.760 --> 33:12.960
We were traveling all over the place.
We were doing a gig in Hartlepool.

33:13.040 --> 33:16.360
Somebody threw a glass at us
when we were walking in the street.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.000
We were doing a gig in Manchester,
and the bloke didn't want to pay

33:20.080 --> 33:22.200
because he thought Wil was shit.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.600
In a world that's now pretty fluid,

33:26.520 --> 33:28.960
he was absolutely fluid,

33:29.040 --> 33:31.120
in a far more rigid world.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.000
I don't know what schools you went to,

33:33.080 --> 33:35.840
but if you were a boy,
and went to my primary school aged five,

33:35.920 --> 33:40.960
and you come in with
Gloworms, Wuzzles, Popples, She-Ra,

33:41.040 --> 33:42.880
and a Bluebird A La Carte Kitchen,

33:43.960 --> 33:46.680
then you would have to learn
to fight pretty dang sharpish.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.840
How long was that we first started?
It's been nearly 20 years.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.800
Fucking, it is.

33:50.880 --> 33:54.160
We used to think people who'd been going
20 years had been going forever back then.

33:54.680 --> 33:59.200
He also once really tried
to fuck one of my aunties,

34:00.560 --> 34:05.080
because he then wanted me
to have to call him "Uncle Wil."

34:05.600 --> 34:09.000
I remember being in
John Oliver's flat in Herne Hill

34:09.080 --> 34:14.040
and playing a recording
I had of you at the Comedy Box,

34:14.720 --> 34:18.960
and John listening to that and going,
"Fucking hell, he's really good."

34:19.040 --> 34:24.000
And I wonder if that's why
he took you under his wing a bit.

34:24.080 --> 34:27.760
When you go to America,
what's amazing is, you see his face

34:27.840 --> 34:30.640
on taxis, and big huge billboards.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.320
-It's properly cool.
-Fucking mad.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.440
-Yeah. You know.
-It's John. It's fucking crazy.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.520
There are little moments

34:38.920 --> 34:42.280
when a friend of yours
does stand-up that are…

34:44.560 --> 34:46.720
really fun to witness.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.480
So watching them

34:49.640 --> 34:52.600
do early gigs and do really well,

34:52.680 --> 34:54.760
watching them do badly,
but standing their ground

34:54.840 --> 34:58.920
because they're finding their voice.
Watching their first Edinburgh show.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.280
Watching them, in Russell's case,
finding a TV show

35:01.360 --> 35:04.040
where he could fit his voice to a format.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.120
We were lucky to have each other
at that particular time.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.040
The fact he used
the phrase "golden generation"

35:10.120 --> 35:13.840
is something I will use against him
for the rest of our lives now.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.320
I'm gonna text him after this and say,

35:16.400 --> 35:19.360
"Listen. One member
of the golden generation to another,

35:19.440 --> 35:21.720
what a golden time to be alive."

35:25.440 --> 35:29.560
In the UK, we have the Edinburgh Fringe.
It's this amazing festival

35:29.640 --> 35:34.080
where, as a comic,
you can hone your craft.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.680
There's reviewers there.
There's TV people there.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.360
Everyone's there.

35:38.440 --> 35:42.880
If you take a great show to Edinburgh,
it can change your life.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.800
That's Steve Hall.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.840
I'm doing a video diary for Edinburgh.

35:47.920 --> 35:51.280
There were so many people
telling him he was the next big thing.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.160
I think it was doing his head in a bit,

35:53.240 --> 35:55.960
because he knew that he wasn't ready.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.000
I have to be very quick. Someone else
is about to go on, but this is my room.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.640
[Russell] 2006,
I figured out how to do it and

36:03.640 --> 36:05.840
I knew what I was about.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.680
Then started doing stuff on TV

36:09.200 --> 36:11.040
and it got out of hand a bit.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.880
It was crazy.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.920
We did a gig in Brighton and 1,800 people.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.680
We'd been performing in front of 400,
and suddenly 1,800 there.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.000
And the energy,
and you're just… and they're like…

36:24.080 --> 36:25.040
[cheering]

36:25.120 --> 36:27.240
Then you come off,
and it's just a bit much.

36:27.320 --> 36:30.880
We had the post-adrenaline slump.

36:30.960 --> 36:34.840
We walked around and he's going,
"This is all happening so quickly."

36:34.920 --> 36:40.520
"So can we just go and get a kebab?
Can we go and just sit?"

36:41.240 --> 36:45.040
"Sit by the beach in Brighton and go,
'Fucking hell!'"

36:45.120 --> 36:47.440
It's such a headfuck to have that kind of…

36:47.520 --> 36:50.120
[cheering]

36:50.200 --> 36:52.520
"Nothing now. Go on, go to bed."

36:53.160 --> 36:54.440
"I don't know if I can."

36:54.520 --> 36:56.520
If you're not used to it,

36:56.600 --> 37:00.760
and then a year later,
we were just doing arenas.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.840
[audience cheering]

37:06.960 --> 37:10.520
There's such a massive adrenaline buzz

37:10.600 --> 37:14.680
about going out in front of 15,000 people.

37:14.760 --> 37:18.280
They're all back there,
and all up there, and I'm thinking,

37:18.360 --> 37:21.920
"Oh my God, they've come to see my boy."

37:22.520 --> 37:24.920
It's like watching fireworks.
How does this happen?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.200
It's just brilliant.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.800
He's like a volcano.

37:27.880 --> 37:31.080
He starts off rumbling,
it builds, and it just goes…

37:31.160 --> 37:32.640
[roaring]

37:38.560 --> 37:43.280
It's crazy. Twenty years ago,
I was doing gigs to 30 people.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.680
Now I can sometimes do gigs to thousands.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.040
It's mental to experience that.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.000
Now we're in a situation where you think,

37:53.080 --> 37:56.560
"God, will I ever get
to experience that again?"

38:07.400 --> 38:09.560
You look at it and go, "Is this allowed?"

38:09.640 --> 38:12.560
They're not wearing masks,
but it is allowed. It's fine.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.200
But it's just…

38:16.840 --> 38:18.480
I don't know. It's weird now.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.920
Maybe today,
with the Bond film being canceled.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.360
[Russell] Did you see the cinemas?

38:23.440 --> 38:26.520
-Cineworld are closed. 12,000 jobs.
-Fuck, they're broke.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.640
135 cinemas closed.

38:29.720 --> 38:33.560
It's a bizarre thing.
You'd never have called it a year ago.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.240
You are better
for Britain than James Bond.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.400
I am better for Britain, exactly.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.160
[laughing]

38:40.240 --> 38:43.200
The venue were on their arse.
They had no money.

38:43.280 --> 38:47.040
They were struggling
to have enough money to pay the rent

38:47.640 --> 38:49.240
that week, I believe.

38:49.320 --> 38:54.600
So I think Russell donated
all of his side of things

38:54.680 --> 38:58.680
to the venue
to help them, you know, survive.

38:59.360 --> 39:04.920
Ladies and gentlemen of the Clapham Grand!

39:05.000 --> 39:07.680
[cheering]

39:07.760 --> 39:12.320
Are you ready?

39:12.400 --> 39:13.480
[cheering]

39:13.560 --> 39:15.640
[Russell]
We were getting tested before every gig,

39:15.720 --> 39:18.760
and the audience were socially distanced,

39:18.840 --> 39:23.320
although they'd set it up
so it felt like the crowd was full.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.080
It felt like
we were the only show in town.

39:26.160 --> 39:32.920
Mr. Russell Howard!

39:33.960 --> 39:35.040
Look at you all.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.200
In your bubbles.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.280
It became this really cool gig where

39:42.360 --> 39:44.760
I could try new material,
I'd invite other comics

39:44.840 --> 39:46.840
to come down and try new stuff.

39:46.920 --> 39:51.200
One week, I even invited James Bay,
who's a mate of mine.

39:51.280 --> 39:55.360
He'd normally be performing to thousands.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.640
He hadn't done a gig
in like a year at this stage.

39:58.720 --> 39:59.760
It was so cool.

39:59.840 --> 40:02.680
I almost don't know how to feel.
I'm like, "A gig?"

40:03.320 --> 40:08.440
[Russell] But the difference is,
how many new songs are you doing?

40:08.520 --> 40:09.360
I'm gonna do one.

40:09.440 --> 40:13.200
I did the equivalent of 15 new songs,

40:13.760 --> 40:16.720
three of which,
it turns out, were actually good songs.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.040
[laughing]

40:18.120 --> 40:20.360
The rest were, "What do you think…"

40:21.800 --> 40:27.280
Please welcome to the stage,
the magnificent James Bay!

40:27.360 --> 40:29.880
[cheering and applause]

40:44.000 --> 40:48.360
I forgot, I've got an important piece
of housekeeping. I'm so sorry, James.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.160
Under the current guidelines,
you're not allowed to sing along.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.360
I can't fucking believe
I forgot to tell you this.

40:54.440 --> 40:57.440
So enjoy it. Clap, cheer, fucking go mad.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.800
But don't sing, because that's very bad.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.880
I'd never gigged with a musician before.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.160
And it was really cool,
because backstage, you could sort of

41:07.840 --> 41:10.280
see that we're all fundamentally the same.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.160
[Russell] It's almost back to open mic.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.680
-Oh that--
-In a sense. Do you know what I mean?

41:14.760 --> 41:17.400
Coming here tonight,
I was getting all the open-mic feels

41:17.480 --> 41:19.600
in the way that you understand them.

41:19.680 --> 41:23.200
There's no glamorizing this moment
when I've got to tune the guitar.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.640
[laughter]

41:24.720 --> 41:27.400
[Russell] Is this the new song, James?
It's pretty experimental.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.160
[laughter]

41:31.080 --> 41:32.040
Are we in tune?

41:33.720 --> 41:35.520
-Fill in, would you?
-[Russell] Yep.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.520
♪ If you're happy and you… ♪

41:38.600 --> 41:39.640
[laughter]

41:39.720 --> 41:41.200
I remember he started saying,

41:41.280 --> 41:44.520
"I'm going to do some gigs again."
It was during the times where

41:44.600 --> 41:47.200
some people in the UK

41:47.280 --> 41:49.680
were all a bit nervous
about this and that.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.840
You knew with Russ,

41:50.920 --> 41:56.600
he was going to find a way,
in a non-wanky way, to help,

41:57.120 --> 42:01.520
and the only way he can help is by
offering his jokes out to people.

42:01.600 --> 42:05.200
We're used to being out,
and working, and gigging.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.480
To have all of that
taken away from you was

42:09.280 --> 42:11.400
mind-bendingly bleak.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.680
My mental health in this whole pandemic

42:14.760 --> 42:17.800
has been assisted massively by

42:18.640 --> 42:20.200
these Clapham gigs.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.000
And they were joyous.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.240
[Russell] The gigs were fun,
but the more it went on,

42:27.320 --> 42:30.560
it became evident that
we were hitting a second wave of COVID.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.880
Do you think
this is gonna be the last one?

42:34.720 --> 42:37.680
What's the moral compass on this?
It's difficult to tell, isn't it?

42:37.760 --> 42:39.920
No, I think, you know.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.680
If we're legally allowed to do it,
we're obliged to do it, I think.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.600
Yeah.

42:44.680 --> 42:48.600
Boris said yesterday that in two weeks,
there's going to be deaths.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.960
-So if they're sort of talking like that…
-Yeah.

42:52.120 --> 42:56.080
[man] Is your intention to keep
doing this, if you can, the Sunday gig?

42:56.160 --> 42:58.400
We're going to do this
until the wheels come off.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.480
-That's generally--
-Yeah.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.360
Around this time, we were like,

43:02.440 --> 43:06.840
"The tour dates
in early 2021 aren't gonna happen."

43:06.920 --> 43:09.040
We were trying
to figure out what could we do.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.760
What's plan A? What's plan B?

43:10.840 --> 43:16.320
Because obviously, I want to do the gigs,
but you have to keep people safe.

43:16.840 --> 43:20.640
You know, if there comes a point
where you can't do both, you have to stop.

43:21.200 --> 43:26.720
But we did have some shows
in New Zealand that were already booked.

43:27.840 --> 43:33.160
There's talk, very early talk,
of possibly doing the gigs in New Zealand.

43:33.240 --> 43:38.880
What we would have to do
is quarantine in a hotel for two weeks.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.240
I think I could do two weeks in a hotel,

43:41.320 --> 43:44.360
knowing that I then had a month of gigs.

43:44.440 --> 43:47.360
New Zealand had obviously done
a different approach to COVID.

43:47.440 --> 43:48.880
They'd locked down early.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.200
They'd eradicated it. It wasn't there.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.280
There was a chance,
if you appealed to the government,

43:54.360 --> 43:55.720
that they would let you in,

43:55.800 --> 43:58.840
so we could do the gigs
that we already had sold out.

43:58.920 --> 44:03.520
[Russell] That's what happens
if you have a competent leader in charge

44:03.600 --> 44:07.640
of your country. As opposed to a man
who is part alpaca, part thesaurus.

44:09.960 --> 44:16.160
Good evening, and apologies for disturbing
Saturday evening with more news of COVID.

44:16.240 --> 44:21.360
[Johnson] Non-essential shops, leisure,
and entertainment venues will be closed.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.240
Pubs, bars, restaurants must close.

44:25.320 --> 44:28.240
It goes without saying, everybody,
don't forget the basics.

44:28.320 --> 44:33.480
Hands, face, space.
Get a test if you have symptoms.

44:33.560 --> 44:35.960
Thank you very much. Stay safe. Thank you.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.280
[Russell] So the gigs ended.

44:39.840 --> 44:42.160
We were back in lockdown again.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.840
In New Zealand,
there was a glimmer of hope.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.600
So we wrote to New Zealand,

44:48.680 --> 44:51.800
and they wrote back,
saying that we were allowed to go.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.320
See ya.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.560
Right, see you later.

45:03.720 --> 45:07.160
It's my solemn wish
that I don't die before you get back.

45:09.480 --> 45:11.000
All right. See you later.

45:19.520 --> 45:22.320
I've just got here, and literally

45:23.120 --> 45:26.160
the UK's gone into
the worst lockdown since March.

45:26.240 --> 45:30.120
So I feel really guilty, if I'm honest.

45:31.720 --> 45:36.760
And on the bus journey here,
seeing it so green, sunny, and beautiful,

45:36.840 --> 45:38.280
I felt terrible.

45:39.560 --> 45:42.400
Now I'm going to be
in a room for two weeks,

45:42.480 --> 45:43.880
I don't feel so bad.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.240
The second wave
was ripping through the UK.

45:46.320 --> 45:50.200
My wife is working on a COVID ward,

45:50.280 --> 45:54.720
and I'm in a hotel room
in New Zealand for two weeks,

45:55.320 --> 45:57.320
just so I can go and do stand-up.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.880
Me and my tour manager Kumar

45:59.960 --> 46:03.000
just spent an hour
in the car park walking in a circle.

46:03.560 --> 46:05.800
A year ago, if I had rang him up and gone,

46:05.880 --> 46:11.480
"Hey mate. Yeah, do you fancy walking
in a circle for an hour in the car park?"

46:12.840 --> 46:15.200
I very much doubt he'd have come. And yet,

46:15.280 --> 46:18.920
we've just had
a really lovely walk in a car park.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.800
It's really strange, isn't it?
When everything is taken from you,

46:25.040 --> 46:27.160
how little things are exciting.

46:27.240 --> 46:31.320
I don't know anybody that would've gone
all the way to New Zealand

46:31.400 --> 46:34.640
and agreed to quarantine for two weeks

46:35.360 --> 46:37.280
to do three shows.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.160
I mean, who would do that?

46:39.240 --> 46:40.560
I tried to stay active.

46:41.600 --> 46:44.680
As active as you can
in a three-by-three meter room.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.280
Had to drag that through the lobby.
Hey, do you want to look like a cunt?

46:48.360 --> 46:51.280
Drag a bike
through a lobby in a quarantine hotel.

46:52.320 --> 46:53.640
I was pretty productive.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.760
I did a lot of writing.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.320
Went on the bike once.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.480
I'm not gonna say I didn't let myself go.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.120
I'm quite messy.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.000
This is the old… That's the masks.

47:10.840 --> 47:13.200
That's the room. As you can see,

47:14.680 --> 47:16.000
it's a bit of a state.

47:16.720 --> 47:19.400
There's something about isolation that

47:19.480 --> 47:24.480
sort of makes you reflect on
the magnitude of what we're going through.

47:25.160 --> 47:30.120
I'm allowed to be sat
in a hotel room in my own filth,

47:30.200 --> 47:33.640
while there's nurses,
doctors, and key workers

47:33.720 --> 47:37.080
who are working their balls off
to make people safe.

47:37.160 --> 47:41.400
It's a humbling experience
to realize how lucky you are.

47:42.320 --> 47:46.440
Christ, what must it be like
to be a doctor or a nurse…

47:50.640 --> 47:51.800
during a pandemic?

47:54.640 --> 47:59.240
Just keep going.
Just keep going. Just keep going.

48:00.560 --> 48:01.720
Fucking mad, man.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.840
There's such a base level of sadness

48:08.920 --> 48:12.120
in the world at the minute,
because of everything that's going on.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.520
And it's your job

48:15.120 --> 48:16.440
as a comedian

48:17.360 --> 48:19.640
to A, not succumb to that,

48:20.240 --> 48:22.120
and sink into the sadness.

48:22.920 --> 48:24.840
And B,

48:24.920 --> 48:26.320
rise above it,

48:26.960 --> 48:30.040
and lift people out of the sadness.

48:30.120 --> 48:33.760
It's lofty. It's wanky. It's pretentious.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.800
But at its best,

48:37.120 --> 48:41.160
that's what stand-up does.
That's what it does to me, anyway.

48:41.240 --> 48:46.520
When I watch Billy Connolly,
or Dave Chappelle, or Bill Burr,

48:47.680 --> 48:51.680
or Taylor Tomlinson,
or Seinfeld, or Lee Evans,

48:52.640 --> 48:53.800
or Frank Skinner.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.000
To just fucking laugh.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.080
What? No, you're rambling.

49:07.160 --> 49:09.280
I was one day away from freedom.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.160
And I was so excited.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.480
Do you know what
I've been doing the whole time?

49:13.560 --> 49:14.680
Just writing jokes.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.520
Fuck, I'm looking forward to these gigs.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.080
[clicking teeth]

49:22.160 --> 49:25.760
In a country totally free from COVID.

49:25.840 --> 49:28.440
No masks, no social distancing,
and they were like,

49:28.520 --> 49:30.160
"You should go out. Enjoy it."

49:30.720 --> 49:33.120
"Go to the beach. Enjoy the countryside."

49:33.200 --> 49:35.000
I was like, "Nah, let's do a gig."

49:35.800 --> 49:38.000
[man] All the way from England,

49:38.080 --> 49:42.200
Mr. Russell Howard!

49:42.280 --> 49:45.000
[cheering and applause]

49:51.360 --> 49:52.280
Yes.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.040
Yes. Yes.

49:56.400 --> 49:57.640
Yes.

50:00.560 --> 50:01.640
Wow. Thank you.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.560
Kia ora.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.960
[laughter]

50:08.040 --> 50:13.040
We quickly realized
that if we got back to England,

50:13.120 --> 50:16.320
we wouldn't be
able to do anything in England at all.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.880
'Cause everything was closed
and locked down.

50:19.480 --> 50:22.560
But we started thinking,
"You know, while we're here,

50:22.640 --> 50:26.680
rather than going home,
and doing nothing at home,

50:26.760 --> 50:30.640
I wonder what would happen if we just
put another couple of shows on?"

50:30.720 --> 50:33.360
Originally, we'd only sold three gigs,

50:34.320 --> 50:36.400
but we just kept adding more gigs.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.200
We just kept going and going.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.520
In the end, we ended up doing 17 shows,

50:43.200 --> 50:46.280
and we ended up staying
for like six weeks?

50:46.360 --> 50:49.680
[Russell] It was so amazing.
Like, you know, full crowds,

50:49.760 --> 50:51.520
no social distancing, no masks.

50:51.600 --> 50:54.280
Doing these huge shows was

50:54.360 --> 50:56.120
absolutely insane.

50:56.760 --> 51:00.400
But it was still on a knife-edge,
because if one person gets COVID

51:00.480 --> 51:02.520
in New Zealand,
they shut down immediately.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.800
There was one gig
in Auckland in particular

51:05.880 --> 51:07.600
that was really close.

51:07.680 --> 51:11.960
[woman] A little change
in circumstance today.

51:12.040 --> 51:16.280
Well, a big change in circumstance today,
as a result of the some of the news

51:16.360 --> 51:21.320
that we've received
around some positive test results.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.440
for COVID-19 in Auckland.

51:23.520 --> 51:26.120
That's why we've taken
this cautious approach

51:26.200 --> 51:30.440
of asking Aucklanders
to move into level 3.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.520
So for the next 72 hours,

51:33.600 --> 51:35.960
if you're in Auckland, please stay home.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.560
We were doing two shows.

51:37.640 --> 51:41.360
The first show,
he was on stage. Everything's fine.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.840
During his performance,

51:43.920 --> 51:46.480
everybody's phone started twitching.

51:46.560 --> 51:50.680
It said everybody has to be indoors

51:50.760 --> 51:52.000
by twelve o'clock.

51:53.120 --> 51:56.040
There is a full lockdown. This is serious.

51:57.160 --> 51:58.840
[Russell] I had no idea it was happening.

51:58.920 --> 52:02.440
It was only when I came offstage
that I realized what had gone on.

52:02.520 --> 52:06.160
Everyone was wearing a mask.
Everyone's standing away from me.

52:06.240 --> 52:09.640
It freaked him out.
He was like, "What's going on?"

52:09.720 --> 52:12.280
The second show had a different energy.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.440
-Feels weird, don't it?
-[nervous laughter]

52:14.520 --> 52:16.640
Feels all strange all of a sudden.

52:16.720 --> 52:19.480
We did a show an hour ago,
and everyone's like, "Wahey!"

52:19.560 --> 52:21.520
Then they left and they're like, "Oh no."

52:21.600 --> 52:23.360
[laughter]

52:24.760 --> 52:26.880
And now I've got to make you laugh,

52:28.360 --> 52:30.480
starting the show at, "Oh no."

52:30.560 --> 52:32.400
[laughter]

52:37.040 --> 52:39.120
You're going to handle it.
It's what you do.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.840
It's phenomenal, innit?

52:40.920 --> 52:43.640
Like, there's three cases.
Jacinda is on it.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.840
She knows where they are.
They're fucking there.

52:46.920 --> 52:50.440
He's gone there. She's done that.
Boris doesn't know how many kids he's got.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.480
[laughter]

52:52.560 --> 52:55.160
[applause]

52:57.400 --> 53:02.440
It was a crazy experience.
It's like I went from performing in 2021

53:02.520 --> 53:03.800
to 2019,

53:03.880 --> 53:07.720
to 2019 to 2021 in the blink of an eye.

53:07.800 --> 53:12.240
It was like the worst kind
of time travel, in every sense.

53:12.320 --> 53:14.960
So we were having this amazing time,

53:15.040 --> 53:19.080
but you know it's temporary,
because, you know,

53:19.160 --> 53:22.280
we're heading back to the UK,
and it's going to be very different.

53:25.360 --> 53:26.840
We're now traveling

53:26.920 --> 53:30.080
on a one-way road to freedom.

53:30.160 --> 53:33.360
From the 21st of June,
we will go to step 4,

53:33.440 --> 53:37.080
and say goodbye
to most remaining restrictions.

53:37.160 --> 53:39.160
There is light ahead.

53:39.240 --> 53:41.120
So Boris did this big announcement

53:41.760 --> 53:44.600
that on June the 21st, we would be out.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.640
We would be free.

53:46.720 --> 53:51.360
It meant that the first gigs
I would do in this new freedom

53:51.440 --> 53:53.520
would be a week of gigs in Bristol

53:53.600 --> 53:58.040
in a place called the Hippodrome,
2,000-seater theater.

53:59.840 --> 54:03.160
Couldn't be better.
Literally the perfect gig

54:03.240 --> 54:07.280
at the best of times,
but after a year of people being inside,

54:07.360 --> 54:10.400
it was going to be like,
"This is going to go off!"

54:11.080 --> 54:12.720
That's what I was aiming to.

54:12.800 --> 54:16.400
But then the closer we get to June 1st,
it becomes apparent.

54:16.480 --> 54:19.200
Obviously, we're not going
to lift restrictions.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.960
I think it is sensible

54:22.040 --> 54:24.400
to wait just a little longer.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.360
So now we've got a problem.

54:26.920 --> 54:28.640
We would have had
to do something ridiculous,

54:28.720 --> 54:31.520
like 21 gigs at the Hippodrome,

54:31.600 --> 54:34.320
to fulfill all the ticket holders

54:34.960 --> 54:39.040
that bought tickets for the Hippodrome
because of the social distancing rules.

54:39.120 --> 54:41.040
And that's clearly impossible.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.880
I mean, how can you do 21 shows

54:43.960 --> 54:46.160
in the space of six days?

54:46.240 --> 54:51.520
We either had to move everything,
or cancel it.

54:51.600 --> 54:55.280
And that is when I had the idea.

54:56.520 --> 54:58.920
Why don't we do
the gigs in a football stadium?

55:02.000 --> 55:04.040
So we're doing Ashton Gate.

55:04.560 --> 55:07.160
We're going to have 2,000 people

55:07.240 --> 55:10.360
in a 10,000-seater stand.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.720
We're not allowed on the pitch.

55:13.800 --> 55:16.640
And we have to bring in our own stage,

55:16.720 --> 55:19.640
and our own sound and our own lighting.

55:19.720 --> 55:23.320
We have to make this happen in four days.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.760
So hopefully,

55:26.520 --> 55:31.200
the ambition of it creates
its own atmosphere, I hope.

55:31.280 --> 55:35.240
I think people
are so desperate to do stuff

55:35.320 --> 55:38.000
that I think they'll put up with it.
I hope they do.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.040
Hopefully we can make it look good.

55:40.600 --> 55:42.000
It's all down to Kumar.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.160
It's not. It's down to me.

55:47.080 --> 55:49.880
I sat down with Russ.
"How are we going to do this?"

55:50.680 --> 55:52.400
But it was really exciting,

55:52.480 --> 55:58.040
because we'd all rather
be doing this than not doing it.

56:02.960 --> 56:06.520

You can't let the gig come to you.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.840
Because of social distance,

58:06.920 --> 58:10.880
we could only have
2,000 people in a 10,000 stand

during this pandemic in order to do a gig.

59:58.400 --> 1:00:01.320
[Kumar] I think we are doing this

1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:04.120
gig at Ashton Gate Stadium

1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:07.120
because of Russell's

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:10.680
absolute obsession with his art,

1:00:10.760 --> 1:00:12.240
and his show,

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:17.840
and his drive to do
what he said he's going to do.

1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:21.840
I have a feeling that
the obsession will absolutely keep going.

1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:25.520
I suppose, you know,
in the same way an elite footballer,

1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:27.680
if they didn't treat it as an obsession,

1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:32.040
they wouldn't get to where
they ultimately have ended up to be.

1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:35.640
Fundamentally, I think
he's going to be like Billy Connolly.

1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:37.280
Maybe more like Ken Dodd.

1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:41.240
He will lock everyone in,
and stay on stage for like four hours

1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:42.640
like a mad bastard.

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:45.760
I genuinely think
he's going to go like that

1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:48.200
probably until he's 80.

1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:50.320
Will he ever stop? Probably not.

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:52.360
He'll have a gag in his coffin somewhere.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:53.280
[laughing]

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.160
[man] Now what do you think
your documentary was about?

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.840
[Russell]
I'll let you in on a little secret.

1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:11.240
I thought basically
it was going to be me saying,

1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:13.480
"Right, I've done this for 20 years."

1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:15.200
"I'm done."

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:20.680
That's what I thought at the beginning.
Let's have a little 20-year memento

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:23.080
and I'll kind of wander off.

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:26.280
The problem is,
comedy is better than real life.

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:28.600
And that is not sustainable,

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:32.200
because it's quite hard to

1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:37.360
judge your self-esteem
through the approval of strangers.

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:42.840
As a 40-year-old man,
this is not the best way to live.

1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:49.560
But it was such
a mindfuck of an 18 months.

1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:52.880
So within all this,
you realize, what are your options?

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:57.520
Your options are to try
and find something to aim for,

1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:01.120
because this time will end,
and if you're lucky,

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:03.600
and you know what it is,
and mine is, "Right."

1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:05.720
"I want to do live stand-up again."

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:09.160
That's it. I put all my energy into that.

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:11.640
And oddly, that's what got me through.

1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:14.240
It was writing and thinking and

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:17.840
obsessing over stand-up,

1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:23.480
and you realize, that's probably
what you're meant to do with your life,

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:28.480
is be a bit of a respite,
a bit of a silly kind of flame.

1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:31.080
That can come along and just dick about,

1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:36.280
and people can get drunk and laugh,
and forget about the past 18 months.

1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:40.040
Or laugh at the past 18 months,
or laugh at the absurdity of our world,

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:43.000
because you might have lost a loved one.

1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:46.600
You might have lost a job.
You might have lost your house.

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:50.760
You might have mentally
found this utterly draining.

1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:01.800
I'm sure if you asked anyone
to rewind back to 2019,

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:04.280
before any of this happened,
of course they would.

1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:10.200
It has been
the most wildly unique time of our lives.

1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:14.120
We almost felt we were immune
from these kind of emergencies.

1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:17.520
These kind of disasters.
And it happened to all of us.

1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:23.160
Obviously, what's happened
has been horrific.

1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:25.800
It's been 18 months of toil,

1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:29.040
and heartache and inertia

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:31.080
for the world.

1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:35.320
But there is always a positive.

1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:36.600
I think we're about

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:40.560
to head into
a golden age of entertainment.

1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:45.040
I think there will be young bands
that have been sat in their houses,

1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:46.520
learning, playing.

1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:50.720
There will be filmmakers
that have watched every film and grown.

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:52.200
There will be comedians.

1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:53.720
So much will come out.

1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:55.960
And it's going to be so exciting,

1:03:56.040 --> 1:04:00.160
because the crowds are going to be
wildly looking forward to it.

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:02.800
People always loved live stuff.

1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:04.040
Now they've realized

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:07.880
how much they need it,
and how much it gives you.

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.440
That's what comedy can do in the moment.

1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:14.880
All those minutes and hours
and days and weeks

1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:16.880
of you, sat there thinking,

1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:19.760
pontificating about these little ideas.

1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:23.320
Suddenly, when you're
in a car park, or a lay-by,

1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:25.440
or a woods, wherever you may be,

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:28.760
you're suddenly alive again,
and there's people there.

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:31.920
You can hear their laughter,
and it's so human.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.320
They're all together, and it's this mass,

1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:37.320
because there is freedom in giggles.

1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:39.200
There's liberation in laughter.

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:43.480
It's always seen as, "Comedy's silly."
But being silly is really important.

1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:46.520
If you're silly,
you can provide real moments for people.

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:48.760
I know that sounds
really stupid, but you can.

1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:51.040
That's what comedy can do in the moment.

1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:52.960
You're presenting people
with an hour and a half

1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:56.440
of silliness, and magic,
and wonder, and absurdity.

1:04:56.520 --> 1:04:58.120
It's the fucking best.

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:04.960
The world has been

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:07.880
flipped upside down.

1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:09.960
We've all been in the Upside Down.

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:12.320
It's a thing that
we never thought could happen.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:14.640
We're still not through it, but

1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:19.760
what option do I, a comedian, have,

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:22.440
but to try and laugh in the face of it?

1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:23.840
So that's what I've done.

1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.920
