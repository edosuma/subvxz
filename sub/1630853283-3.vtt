00:22.981 --> 00:24.566
Makeup
So, do you have any kids?

00:26.109 --> 00:29.612
Yeah. I have a son
who's 30, and a...

00:29.696 --> 00:31.531
grandson who's 7.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.742
They're living with me
at the moment.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.493
Oh, how come?

00:35.577 --> 00:38.621
Oh, my son lost his job,
and they have no money.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.665
Makeup
Well, being a parent
is for life.

00:40.749 --> 00:44.294
-Hey. There they are.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.129
Mr. Cousineau.
I'm the producer, Joel,

00:46.212 --> 00:49.090
-and this is our
showrunner, Brian.
-Hey.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.302
Do you remember me?

00:52.385 --> 00:56.139
"Murder, She Wrote"?
I was a P.A. You attacked me.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.515
I need more.

00:57.599 --> 01:01.811
You threw hot tea in my face
because your omelet had chives.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.898
-Was I playing a priest?
-Very honored to have you
on the show.

01:04.981 --> 01:08.193
Um, what you did for this vet

01:08.276 --> 01:09.736
was inspiring,

01:09.819 --> 01:12.155
and we wanted to pay you
back for your service,

01:12.238 --> 01:15.033
so we are giving you
a line.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.162
-You're giving me a line?
-It's a small line,

01:19.245 --> 01:22.624
four or five words,
but it's pivotal to the story.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.418
Mr. Cousineau,
what do you say?

01:27.212 --> 01:28.338
Thank you.

01:38.473 --> 01:42.018
Look at this place.
Shit everywhere!

01:43.228 --> 01:45.855
We were hit. We were hit!

01:45.939 --> 01:49.400
Thank God we were on that
tour bus! You know, man,

01:49.484 --> 01:52.487
if not for that
Groupon almost expiring,

01:52.570 --> 01:54.155
we'd all be dead men.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.824
-Is everyone okay?
-I just checked.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.284
-Everyone is safe
in hiding places.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.746
Fucking Bolivians!

02:01.830 --> 02:03.081
They want their heroin back.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.791
And if that happens,
we're fucked!

02:04.874 --> 02:07.877
NoHo
I wouldn't be so quick
to blame Bolivians.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.589
I mean, I think it's just
neighborhood kids being chodes.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.216
No, no, no, no, no.
Clearly,

02:13.299 --> 02:16.261
Cristobal sent
his goons after us!

02:16.344 --> 02:20.557
We're going to find him,
and we're going to take him out.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.684
Or... Or...

02:22.767 --> 02:25.895
we make a call to Chechnya.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.231
You want to
activate the patsy?

02:28.314 --> 02:30.108
Oh, I want to
activate the patsy.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.361
Fuches!

02:33.444 --> 02:36.364
-Telephone call from America!

02:36.447 --> 02:38.533
Coming, my love!

02:38.616 --> 02:41.619
Come on.

02:44.455 --> 02:48.042
This way, my girls!
Yeah, let's go.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.004
Daddy got a phone call! Come on!

02:51.087 --> 02:52.547
-Come on!

03:07.729 --> 03:09.772
-Hello?
-NoHo Hank Fuches!

03:09.856 --> 03:11.274
It's me!

03:11.357 --> 03:14.319
It's Hank.
It's NoHo Hank. Hi.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.070
-Oh hey, Hank.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.449
-What's shakin'?
-NoHo So, great news.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.535
Coast is clear.
Heat is off us.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.078
No need to live on the lam.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.040
-You mean I can come back home?

03:27.123 --> 03:29.792
I booked you a flight
that leaves tonight.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.922
-Well...

03:34.005 --> 03:37.133
Tell you the truth,
I'm really happy here.

03:37.216 --> 03:40.637
-What?
-Yeah, I got myself a little
slice of heaven here.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.680
Turns out, I'm a natural

03:42.764 --> 03:45.308
-at everything goat.
-NoHo Okay...

03:45.391 --> 03:46.643
But

03:46.726 --> 03:49.270
I just cooled Barry's heels
for you. I-I mean.

03:49.354 --> 03:53.107
he's not even mad at you
anymore. I just saw him.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.777
-You saw Barry?
-NoHo Yeah, and TBH,

03:55.860 --> 03:57.612
you're not even on
his mind anymore.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.948
You're not a blimp
on his radar, okay?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.909
He is total basket case,
and he looks like shit.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.289
Well...

04:08.373 --> 04:09.624
I'm not interested, Hank.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.709
No need to contact me anymore.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.178
Well, now we have no choice
but to do suicide mission.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.389
Cristobal and Bolivians
die tonight!

04:24.472 --> 04:26.265
-You look beautiful.
-Beautiful.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.269
Thanks.
I'm really fucking nervous.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.688
Oh, I have deodorant.
I'll get it.
I have the good kind.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.648
-The cancer kind!
-Sally,

04:33.731 --> 04:35.942
just be yourself.
You're gonna be great.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.819
Okay, thank you.
That's fine.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.446
Oh, um, do you think they're
gonna ask about my childhood?

04:40.530 --> 04:42.240
Shit, I hope they don't
ask about Sam, but, I mean,

04:42.323 --> 04:43.741
I'm sure they've
done their research.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.284
Oh, do you want some
Vaseline for your teeth?

04:45.368 --> 04:46.619
Alexis Kaplan has
a daughter on "Pam!"

04:46.703 --> 04:48.538
and in real life.
I don't have one in real life.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.832
Is that bad?
You think they're gonna
call me inauthentic?

04:50.915 --> 04:52.959
I mean, should I say that
I'm considering adoption?

04:53.042 --> 04:54.460
No. I-I think they'll see

04:54.544 --> 04:56.879
how authentic your passion
for the show is.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.048
Just don't be too
passionate, you know?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.592
You don't wanna be
the real you
in the wrong way.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.886
By the way, I love
this romper. It says,

05:03.970 --> 05:05.805
"I'm a woman, but don't
treat me like one."

05:05.888 --> 05:06.931
That's what we were going for.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.226
Oh my god!
Oh, you look so cute!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.937
Oh, thank you. I mean,
this is all so exciting!

05:13.021 --> 05:16.190
-You are going to have
so much fun, sweetie.
-Oh, yeah.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.359
-I'm just really nervous.
-Oh, don't be. Oh my god.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.153
Just be yourself.
You'll be fine. You'll be great.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.155
-Yeah.
-No, no reason to be nervous.

05:22.238 --> 05:26.034
-Okay.
You all set? Okay, great.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.244
Just go in.
You have five minutes.

05:28.327 --> 05:31.706
Ask a few questions.
You're talking to Sally Reed.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.375
It's spelled R-E-E-D.
The show's called "Joplin."

05:34.459 --> 05:38.087
Talking to Sally Reed.
You all set? Alright. Mm!

05:39.589 --> 05:41.340
-Hey, Sally.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.552
-- Hey!
-- Here's Madeleine
from "E! News."

05:44.635 --> 05:47.263
Sally Reed!
How you doin', girl?

05:47.346 --> 05:49.390
-I'm good.
-Now, the show
takes place in Joplin,

05:49.474 --> 05:51.184
-and you were raised there.
-Mm-hmm, that's right.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.477
Is that really
what Joplin's like?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.937
Well, it's a lot
less freezing on set.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.567
Okay, great. Thanks.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.653
-Here's Mike
from "Access Hollywood."

06:02.737 --> 06:05.990
Sally Reed!
How ya doin', girl?

06:06.074 --> 06:09.243
-I'm good.
-This is a show about a woman
trying to help her daughter

06:09.327 --> 06:11.537
leave an abusive relationship
in Joplin, Missouri.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.956
-Yes, that's right.
-Was that tough?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.794
-Yes?
-Alright, great.
And who do you think

06:17.877 --> 06:19.754
should be the next Spider-Man?

06:19.837 --> 06:21.214
Uh...

06:22.548 --> 06:24.133
Ben Mendelsohn?

06:27.053 --> 06:29.305
-Okay...

06:29.388 --> 06:31.599
-- Here's Taylor
from "Screen Nerd."
-- There she is,

06:31.682 --> 06:33.768
-Sally Reed. Girl boss.
-Hi.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.646
Hashtag "you go, girl!"
You feeling 100, yeah?

06:39.273 --> 06:43.069
They let me keep my beard.

06:43.152 --> 06:46.114
Yeah, they said some pharma guys
actually have a beard like this.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.282
Ah!

06:53.162 --> 06:56.290
Wanna run lines?
Yeah? Alright.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.377
What I did was terrible,

06:59.460 --> 07:01.587
and I'm truly sorry.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.508
I accept your apology.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.929
That was great.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.599
Oh, man.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.562
This trailer is nice.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.481
Might go over to the
"Wheel of Fortune" building,

07:20.565 --> 07:23.276
-take some pictures--
-Did she suffer?

07:35.246 --> 07:38.541
But she figured out
that it was you
she was looking for.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.628
And I invited you to my cabin.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.845
Who was that guy that
took me into the woods?

07:50.928 --> 07:53.723
He's nobody.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.641
Actually, you know what?
That's not true.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.810
I want to be honest with you

07:57.894 --> 08:00.354
because I think we have
a good thing going here.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.564
Um...

08:02.565 --> 08:04.942
He's a family friend.

08:05.026 --> 08:08.654
-He's actually kinda like a--
-An uncle?

08:08.738 --> 08:10.948
He got you into
this line of work?

08:12.867 --> 08:15.536
So that monologue
that you gave me

08:15.620 --> 08:18.331
when I first met you,
that was fuckin' true?

08:20.124 --> 08:23.419
And then I said it again
at the dinner table.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.257
-And she knew it was you.
-Hey, we don't need
to rehash all this.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.509
If I didn't say anything...

08:32.470 --> 08:35.181
-she'd be alive today.
-Ah, no, don't put
that on yourself,

08:35.264 --> 08:37.516
Mr. Cousineau.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.853
No, she was good at her job.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.065
The whole thing's just
really unfortunate, you know?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.944
Look, I believe,

08:48.027 --> 08:51.197
and some of this I got
from your teachings, that...

08:51.280 --> 08:54.742
th-that you can be the version
of yourself that you want to be.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.869
I never said that to you.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.163
What I'm saying is...

08:59.247 --> 09:01.999
is that I never
would've learned that
if it wasn't for you.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.710
So, I'm responsible
for who you are?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.921
The positive side. Yeah.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.675
I mean, meeting you
changed my life
for the better, you know?

09:13.302 --> 09:15.304
Look, we've both done
terrible things in our lives,

09:15.388 --> 09:18.224
but we're helping
each other...

09:18.307 --> 09:20.726
make up for it.
You know?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.813
I mean, you got a line.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.443
You're welcome.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.374
-Hey, Cristobal!

09:44.542 --> 09:47.169
We're heading back
to the nursery!

09:47.253 --> 09:50.965
To hit the Chechens during
regular business hours.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.343
-Huh.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.178
Suegro...

09:56.262 --> 09:59.015
I want the revenge
just as bad as you do,

09:59.098 --> 10:01.183
but, as you saw,

10:01.267 --> 10:04.854
uh, we were shooting
at empty tents.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.522
They're on the run.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.318
I've been here,

10:10.401 --> 10:12.528
working this territory, a...

10:13.404 --> 10:15.364
and I'm good at my job.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.743
And I'm telling you,
th-there is nothing for us here.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.083
Cristobal.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.505
You're right.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.716
You are good at your job.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.887
We'll cut our losses
and head back home.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.139
We gave LA a shot,
didn't work out.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.807
Win some, lose some.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.101
-It's all about perspective.
-Mm-hmm.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.188
So, we'll head back to Bolivia?

10:48.397 --> 10:49.607
Yes.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.364
How do I break it to the guys?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.241
They're ready to go.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.454
Maybe take them to lunch first.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.005
I know what I'll do.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.091
I'll take them
to Johnny Rockets.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.468
And then after,
in the parking lot,

11:17.551 --> 11:20.930
I'll say, "Hey. We aren't
attacking the Chechens.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.682
We're heading back to Bolivia."

11:25.935 --> 11:28.813
Thanks for helping me
figure that out.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.117
-Fuck.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.667
What's that?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.127
I bought bomb on dark web.

11:51.210 --> 11:55.047
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
did you do that for?

11:55.131 --> 11:56.882
We use this to blow up
Cristobal's house.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.134
No.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.219
We want Fernando dead,

12:00.302 --> 12:01.595
okay?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.889
He is head of whole
Bolivian operation.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.975
He ordered the hit on us.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.105
How do you know it is this...

12:11.188 --> 12:12.982
Fernando?

12:13.816 --> 12:16.110
I just know. I...

12:16.193 --> 12:17.820
Cristobal is a nobody, okay?

12:17.903 --> 12:21.198
He's, like, fourth, fifth
in command. Fernando...

12:22.992 --> 12:25.619
is the real threat here, okay?

12:25.703 --> 12:28.664
-Trust me.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.709
Hm. Just blow up
the fucking house.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.879
-Good luck, Akhmal.
-What? What the fuck
does it have to be me?!

12:34.962 --> 12:37.339
-Can't we draw straws?
-Who are you?

12:37.423 --> 12:40.759
-Bruce Willis in "Armageddon"?
-I don't wanna do this.
This is crazy.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.182
I know someone crazy.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.572
Jesus fucking Christ...

13:05.034 --> 13:07.119
Hank, I said no.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.829
Fuches
Barry?

13:10.664 --> 13:11.999
Fuches?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.210
Where are you?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.086
-Heaven, Barry.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.796
Seriously, where are you?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.924
Why?
You gonna come find me?

13:20.674 --> 13:21.967
No.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.011
Hank said that you
cooled off a bit,

13:24.094 --> 13:28.015
said you were on hard times.
I-I'm sorry to hear that.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.935
-I'm fine.
-I wanna say

13:31.018 --> 13:32.937
I'm sorry...

13:33.020 --> 13:34.897
for whatever it is
you think I did

13:34.980 --> 13:37.691
to hurt your relationship
with Mr. Cousineau.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.362
Okay.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.280
Okay, good. Good.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.241
Uh, now in the spirit
of that comment,

13:45.324 --> 13:47.535
is there something
you'd like to say to me?

13:49.578 --> 13:50.496
No.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.420
I'm dying, Barry.
I'm in the hospital.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.340
Yeah, doctors are being cagey.
Not a lot of eye contact.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.426
So, if there ever
was a time you did wanna
say something to me,

14:04.510 --> 14:07.888
-now would be that time.
-Are those goats
in the background?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.431
I could give you
some apology options

14:09.515 --> 14:11.392
off the top of my head,
Barry.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.936
"I'm sorry I shot at you!

14:14.019 --> 14:17.022
I'm sorry for ruining your
heroin deal with the Burmese!"

14:17.106 --> 14:18.649
Alright, I don't have
time for this, okay?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.067
Me and Mr. Cousineau are fine.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.361
Please don't
call me again, alright?

14:29.827 --> 14:33.247
-Yeah?
-What the fuck do you mean
you and Cousineau are fine?

14:33.330 --> 14:35.291
I mean, we're fine.
We worked our shit out together.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.126
Actually, we're working
together today.

14:37.209 --> 14:41.463
-Oh, you're working.
-Yeah. On a show called
"Laws of Humanity."

14:41.547 --> 14:43.591
-That's a great show.
-And I know

14:43.674 --> 14:44.883
you told him I killed Janice,

14:44.967 --> 14:47.219
-but we hashed it out,
like adults.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.679
So, there's no need
to apologize

14:48.762 --> 14:50.639
'cause your little
fucking plan didn't work.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.141
Oh, you're good, are you?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.976
You're never going
to move past that!

14:54.059 --> 14:55.561
You destroyed that guy's life!

14:55.644 --> 14:58.272
Yeah, well now, I'm making
it up to him. By acting.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.940
-How the fuck do you do that!?!
-Why do you care?

15:00.024 --> 15:02.109
-I don't care!
-Well, you obviously
fuckin' care. You called me.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.320
-You called me.
-You are fuckin' nuts, man.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.238
-Also, I know you're
on a farm or something

15:06.322 --> 15:07.948
because I can hear goats
in the background.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.117
Maybe I'm at the zoo
with my new best friend!

15:10.200 --> 15:13.621
-Thought you said you
were at a hospital.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.676
I never answered the same
question so many times

15:27.760 --> 15:29.386
in my whole life.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.265
Did they ask you who
the new Spider-Man should be?

15:33.349 --> 15:36.560
-Yeah, I think I said
Harry Styles or something.
-Shit, that's good.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.187
Did they ask you
about "Cake Boss"?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.397
Yeah, is he one of
the new Avengers?

15:40.481 --> 15:43.817
No, it's, um--
that's a baking competition.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.028
Shit, that's embarrassing.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.241
Hey, do you have a date
for the premiere tomorrow?

15:51.325 --> 15:52.785
Not unless you
count my parents.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.871
Well, you're welcome to ride
with me and Barry, if you want.

15:55.954 --> 15:58.791
-We have a limo.
-Um...

15:58.874 --> 16:01.919
Yeah, um, no,
th-that's okay. Yeah.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.588
Hey, Sally, they're
ready for you again.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.924
-Ugh.
-I know. You got this.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.511
Hi Sally, follow me.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.180
-Hey, can I give you
a word of advice?
-Mm.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.849
When your boss invites you
to the premiere with her,

16:15.933 --> 16:18.352
-you don't say no.
-Uh...

16:18.435 --> 16:22.564
Yeah, no.
Um, it's-- I, um, I...

16:22.648 --> 16:26.443
I-I don't really feel, uh,
comfortable around Barry.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.070
Why?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.531
Um, well, uh...

16:30.614 --> 16:32.783
The other day in
the writer's room, he, like,

16:32.866 --> 16:34.702
screamed at her
in front of everyone,

16:34.785 --> 16:37.079
and it was...
it was really bad.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.206
Oh, yeah.
No, I've seen him
do that before.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.917
He's totally harmless.
I'm sure he was
having a bad day.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.752
I was in an acting class
with Barry,

16:43.836 --> 16:46.004
and he's a really
good guy.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.799
He yelled at us
a few times, and,

16:48.882 --> 16:51.427
you know, he told us that
he killed a few people in...

16:51.510 --> 16:54.430
some war, and that it
really messed him up. But,

16:54.513 --> 16:57.141
I don't think that makes
him violent.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.102
I feel like he's
gonna do something.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.062
To Sally?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.856
He treats Sally like a star.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.941
That's why she keeps
him around.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.531
-So, you were a Marine?
-Mm-hmm.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.742
-I do CrossFit with
a lot of Marines.
-Oh, that's cool.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.034
They're always telling me
like, "Dude,

17:16.118 --> 17:17.953
you totally could've
been a Marine."

17:18.037 --> 17:19.413
And I thought about joining,
but, you know,

17:19.496 --> 17:21.290
I guess I had too many
other options.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.626
-- Huh.
-- Going on a bell!

17:25.252 --> 17:27.629
Oh yeah, thanks.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.882
Alright, here we go.
Excuse me.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.262
-Crew...settle!

17:35.345 --> 17:36.972
Crew
Lock it down!

17:37.055 --> 17:39.975
And we're rolling...

17:40.058 --> 17:43.520
And... action!

17:43.604 --> 17:46.023
As you know,
I got you the full amount

17:46.106 --> 17:48.817
on the wrongful death
of your dear wife.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.861
But no amount of money
can make this right.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.989
They need to come here,
look you in the eye,

17:54.072 --> 17:55.657
and apologize.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.159
Bring him in!

18:02.498 --> 18:05.918
Thank you for teaching me
how to right my wrongs.

18:06.001 --> 18:06.919
Mr. Manity.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.338
Please, call me Hugh.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.256
Sir, my, uh,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.968
company knowingly
hiked the prices of a drug

18:15.052 --> 18:18.013
that would've saved
your wife's life.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.849
What I did was terrible,

18:20.933 --> 18:23.060
and I'm truly sorry.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.872
-I want you to stay
away from my family!

18:43.956 --> 18:47.125
Fuck you, and don't talk to
me anymore, you piece of shit!

19:10.691 --> 19:12.526
Shit...

19:12.609 --> 19:15.362
This show deals with abuse
and is so personal.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.114
What's it like
being a part of that?

19:17.197 --> 19:19.783
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's
really amazing, honestly.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.869
And, like, Sally's so, just,

19:21.952 --> 19:24.705
inspiring with the way
she talks about it all,

19:24.788 --> 19:27.624
and is so open about it. Um...

19:27.708 --> 19:29.126
Yeah, it-it's really cool.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.587
I was just speaking with her,
and it's so good to hear

19:31.670 --> 19:34.047
that she's in
a healthy relationship now.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.845
Yeah. Um...

19:39.928 --> 19:41.555
Her boyfriend...

19:42.264 --> 19:43.348
Um...

19:44.725 --> 19:48.312
He's great. He's--
Yeah, he's, um, he's awesome.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.209
-This is Hank.
-Barry I'm in.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.379
Are you fucking serious?
Barry's back.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.841
-Yes!
-This one's a doozy.
He's head of Bolivian crime--

20:17.925 --> 20:22.638
Just tell me how much
and, uh, where I'm going.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.140
-And I'll be there.
-NoHo Barry,
you are a real one, okay?

20:25.223 --> 20:28.602
You're doing me such
a solid, you have no idea.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.729
Okay, um...
It-it's very complicated.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.856
There's lots of ins and outs
to it, but thank you.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.942
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.235
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

20:39.488 --> 20:43.909
So, you are giving
this job to a madman...

20:43.992 --> 20:47.204
who killed most of our men
at the monastery?

20:49.581 --> 20:51.875
Yes, but ...

20:51.959 --> 20:55.796
don't we want a madman?
I mean, Barry is...

20:55.879 --> 20:58.548
Greek Freak of assassins, okay?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.177
The monastery?

21:02.260 --> 21:04.680
He was just having a bad day.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.847
Oh...

21:06.932 --> 21:10.143
But, I wanted to
get rid of Barry,

21:11.395 --> 21:14.398
and you insisted
that we use Fuches,

21:14.481 --> 21:16.608
which was bust.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.944
And now,

21:19.027 --> 21:22.239
you want to stop me
going after Cristobal.

21:42.342 --> 21:45.012
I hate seeing you like this.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.431
So riled up about Barry,

21:47.514 --> 21:49.891
when he's not even
thinking of you.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.436
That's exactly why
I wanna kill him.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.896
You don't.
Vengeance is like

21:54.980 --> 21:58.025
drinking poison, hoping
the other person will die.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.901
Well, at least he'd be dead.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.907
Aren't you happy here?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.871
If you knew everything
I did for him...

22:12.539 --> 22:15.417
all I sacrificed to
give this kid a life...

22:16.293 --> 22:18.045
you'd feel different.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.636
Do you know the story
of the Bolam-Deela?

22:27.429 --> 22:29.014
Yeah.

22:29.097 --> 22:32.309
No, you don't.
I know you don't.

22:36.104 --> 22:39.107
A long time ago,
in the Argun Gorge,

22:39.191 --> 22:42.694
a man came across
a beautiful farmland,

22:42.778 --> 22:44.571
and he had to make it his.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.574
So, he killed the farmers
and took the land.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.910
And from that day forward,
their dead souls

22:49.993 --> 22:52.954
wandered his land in purgatory.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.916
Until one day, a creature,

22:55.999 --> 22:57.375
the Bolam-Deela,

22:57.459 --> 23:00.754
appeared and offered
the souls a choice.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.548
You can forgive the man
and go to Heaven

23:03.632 --> 23:05.258
or seek vengeance.

23:05.342 --> 23:09.805
All of the souls chose vengeance
except for one little boy.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.933
So, the Bolam-Deela
granted the souls their wish

23:13.016 --> 23:15.602
and turned them
all into panthers.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.688
The panthers,
so full of fury and rage,

23:18.772 --> 23:21.191
attacked and killed
the landowner.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.568
But their souls?

23:23.652 --> 23:25.320
They went to the bottom
of the ocean,

23:25.403 --> 23:29.407
where they drifted in the cold,
dark depths for eternity.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.287
And the little boy
who chose forgiveness?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.332
He was sent to Heaven.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.837
You say this happened
to a friend of yours?

23:41.920 --> 23:44.631
It's a fable from
the 16th century.

23:44.714 --> 23:47.092
-How long did it take him?
-How long did what take him?

23:47.175 --> 23:48.552
The Vengeance Army
panther thing.

23:48.635 --> 23:51.388
How long did it take him
to put that together?

23:51.471 --> 23:52.931
It didn't really happen.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.684
It's a morality story.
It's not real.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.898
But it could be.
