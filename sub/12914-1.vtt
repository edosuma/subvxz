WEBVTT

00:26.760 --> 00:30.829
(smooth guitar music)

01:04.798 --> 01:08.867
(rock music)

01:21.247 --> 01:25.317
- [Voiceover] This is life in
the entertainment capital of
the world.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.496
No time to sweat the little
stuff.

01:46.339 --> 01:51.877
May not look like it, but what
I'm doing here is making movies.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.446
Well, I'm not the one who
actually makes the movies,

01:54.448 --> 01:56.715
I just work for
someone that does.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.183
A very successful someone.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.362
Everyone's gotta pay their dues

02:10.364 --> 02:11.864
For me, that means
picking up half a dozen

02:11.866 --> 02:14.166
rolls of toilet paper
and a case of cat food.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.034
And whatever else
the boss needs.

02:16.036 --> 02:20.005
(phone ringing)

02:21.407 --> 02:22.808
Then there's the endless
streams of phone calls

02:22.810 --> 02:26.278
from his assistant, Tiffany.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.918
I keep telling myself,
one of these days.

02:37.323 --> 02:40.826
(phone ringing)

02:40.828 --> 02:42.327
- [Voiceover] You need to start
answering the fucking phone.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.762
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.598
I'm almost done, I'm headed
back to Malibu right now.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.533
- [Voiceover]
That's great, Josh,

02:47.535 --> 02:48.567
the doc give you any problems?

02:48.569 --> 02:49.768
- Huh?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.904
- [Voiceover] Did Doc
give you any shit? - What?

02:51.906 --> 02:53.472
- [Voiceover] You didn't pick
up Brian's pills, did you.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.507
- [Josh] Oh I'm
sorry, I had no idea.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.542
- [Voiceover] Doc's
waiting for you.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.376
- What, right now?

02:57.378 --> 02:58.177
- [Voiceover] Yes.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.411
Right now.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.947
- Oh, but traffic is
gonna be a nightmare.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.515
- [Voiceover] That's not my
problem, just get over there.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.850
- But every time I go over there

03:04.852 --> 03:06.118
something bad happens.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.553
- [Voiceover] Josh?

03:07.555 --> 03:09.288
- It's okay, I'm
headed there now.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.156
- [Voiceover] Make it snappy.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.025
- Snappy, that's
easy for you to say.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.226
- [Voiceover] What was that?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.295
- Oh, nothing,
I'll see you soon.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.177
Hollywood, a ball-busting grind.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.416
Not much in the way of glamor.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.777
Hey Doc, you there?

04:05.779 --> 04:08.480
- Let's see what we got here.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.484
I've got some Vicodin, Xanax.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.321
Got some Oxycontin.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.423
And I got some Lunesta.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.858
What's the dosage?

04:20.861 --> 04:25.831
- He didn't say, so whatever
the max is, I guess.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.970
- It's $250 for these two.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.607
You look a little beat.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.709
Got some dexedrine, wanna try

04:37.711 --> 04:38.744
a sample of that?

04:38.746 --> 04:39.411
- Oh, what?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.946
No, I'm okay.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.848
It's just this girl, Tiffany.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.883
She's been runnin'
me ragged all week.

04:44.885 --> 04:45.951
- She hot?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.019
- Yeah.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.388
- Ah, that's worse.

04:49.390 --> 04:56.662
(motorcycle revving)

05:01.100 --> 05:04.469
(whistling)

05:04.471 --> 05:06.905
- Uh, everything okay?

05:06.907 --> 05:10.175
- Oh yeah, the Gypsy Rebels.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.878
They seem to be under
the mistaken impression

05:12.880 --> 05:15.113
that I owe them money.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.449
just in case things
get out of hand,

05:17.451 --> 05:19.818
best deterrent in the biz.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.386
- Heh.

05:22.622 --> 05:23.455
- Yo Doc!

05:23.457 --> 05:25.791
Open up!

05:26.926 --> 05:28.093
Yo, go check out the back.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.328
- You better make
yourself scarce.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.596
Hide in there.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.265
- Wait, wait, the Lunesta.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.000
- I'll call you when I
finish with these guys.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.169
- Open up, Doc!

05:37.171 --> 05:39.604
Don't make us come
in there, let's go!

05:39.606 --> 05:41.306
Stop hiding, Doc.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.510
Finally, thanks.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.212
Time to pay up.

05:49.382 --> 05:50.849
- Fuck.

05:50.851 --> 05:56.388
- [Man] Yo, come on, Doc,
you know you owe us money.

06:00.827 --> 06:01.893
(gunfire)

07:00.987 --> 07:03.355
(phone ringing)

07:03.357 --> 07:05.056
- [Voiceover] Hey,
where the hell are you?

07:05.058 --> 07:07.459
- [Voiceover] No, I need
you at Natalie K's ASAP.

07:07.461 --> 07:11.129
Here's the address,
334 Rodeo Drive.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.298
That's in Beverly
Hills, by the way.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.366
(smooth dance music)

07:38.825 --> 07:40.525
- It's okay, Jay.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.031
Josh, is it?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.032
- Yes.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.934
What's your name?

07:48.936 --> 07:52.204
- I've made a selection Mr.
Campbell is sure to like.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.207
These are two of
my favorite pieces.

07:55.209 --> 07:56.341
(phone ringing)

07:56.343 --> 07:57.576
- Okay.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.643
Hey.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.611
- [Voiceover] Are you there yet?

07:59.613 --> 08:00.712
- Yeah.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.048
- Yeah, I'm handing
you to Brian.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.817
- [Voiceover] Okay, Josh,
let's see the necklace.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.753
- Okay, that's that one,

08:08.755 --> 08:10.155
and that's the other one.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.024
- [Voiceover] That's
the one, get it.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.894
- Is Black Card okay?

08:19.732 --> 08:22.701
- You made a fine
choice, Mr. Campbell.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.172
I'll get it cleaned it up
for you, and it'll be ready

08:27.174 --> 08:29.441
- [Voiceover] Josh, I
got a call coming in,

08:29.443 --> 08:30.709
I'm gonna hand you
back to Tiffany.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.910
- All right.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.511
- Look sharp.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.013
Brian wants you to
pick up the necklace

08:35.015 --> 08:36.914
on Sunday before the party.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.883
- Okay.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.284
- Duly noted.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.123
(smooth rock-alternative music)

09:18.958 --> 09:20.225
- Oh, hey Catherine.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.226
- Interesting look.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.727
- You'll never believe
what I had to go through

09:22.729 --> 09:25.463
to get this look.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.566
- I want you to shut your
mouth and open your ears.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.168
The word of the day is timing.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.971
Timing, believe it or
not, is everything.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.807
- Hey, Josh, did you do
this to me on purpose?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.309
- What, these bikers
showed up and I--

09:37.311 --> 09:40.845
- Put everything there, Brian
wants to see you right away.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.181
- You work with me, we are
lions in the tall grass

09:43.183 --> 09:44.983
waitin' for the weakness.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.786
Waitin' for that
hobbled antelope, okay?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.287
I don't care, my
friend, you call me

09:49.289 --> 09:50.755
with the answer I'm looking for.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.923
You got one hour.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.525
Bye.

09:53.527 --> 09:57.329
Wow, a tank top, now
that is adorable.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.863
Just gotta get comfortable.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.336
- You forgot the
Natural Nutro Dog Food.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.404
- Oh no, I got three suits
from Sunset Drycleaning,

10:06.406 --> 10:08.440
I got the Scott
tissue toilet paper

10:08.442 --> 10:11.509
and two bags of cat food.

10:11.511 --> 10:15.146
I was just running from
Culver City to Silverlake--

10:15.148 --> 10:17.048
- Oh God, I hate that word.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.150
you know, when I was your
age, I never had to say sorry

10:19.152 --> 10:21.252
because I was willing
to do anything,

10:21.254 --> 10:24.522
and I mean anything
to get the job done.

10:24.524 --> 10:28.259
Performance, my friend,
performance is everything.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.961
You gotta carve that
list into your arm

10:29.963 --> 10:31.630
so you don't forget, and do it.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.299
- I think last week he forgot
the caramel creme brulee,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.067
week before that it
was the gulf clubs?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.268
- [Campbell] He forgot
the creme brulee?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.236
- [Tiffany] Yeah.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.738
- Let me tell you something.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.773
You know that graphic novel
All the Devils are Here?

10:41.775 --> 10:42.741
Guess what?

10:42.743 --> 10:43.908
I liked it.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.343
I optioned it.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.712
And we are going into production
at the end of the spring.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.281
You have a good
eye for material,

10:50.283 --> 10:52.083
but you can't forget
the little things.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.718
You understand me?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.987
- Yes.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.155
He was out of Lunesta.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.724
- Yeah, tough to come by.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.560
Listen, I know you
got what it takes.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.629
And the good news
is in two months

11:04.631 --> 11:06.464
I might have an
opening for somebody

11:06.466 --> 11:08.667
in development, but I need a guy

11:08.669 --> 11:10.969
who doesn't forget
the little things.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.170
You got me?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.805
- Yeah.

11:13.807 --> 11:14.806
- Now get out of here.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.474
Go out there and make me proud.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.243
- Yes sir, I will.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.144
- [Campbell] That sound good?

11:19.146 --> 11:20.145
Was that inspirational?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.079
- Yeah, it was great.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.380
- Good, and Josh one more thing.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.682
If you're gonna wear a tank top

11:23.684 --> 11:26.151
get a tan, you look
like a vampire.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.052
- Okay.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.653
- Oh, Josh, don't forget.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.088
Sunday.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.389
Birthday present for Catherine.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.624
- Yeah, would it
be all right if--

11:32.626 --> 11:34.025
- What? - Uh, it would
make more sense

11:34.027 --> 11:36.027
if I could just pick
it up on my way home

11:36.029 --> 11:37.629
and then I could
bring it on Sunday?

11:37.631 --> 11:39.397
Because it would save
me a lot of time and--

11:39.399 --> 11:40.165
- No.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.367
Petty cash please.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.436
Hello?

11:44.438 --> 11:46.971
Hi, yeah, 8 o'clock, yep,

11:46.973 --> 11:48.273
chateau, Bar Marmont.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.074
You know what?

11:49.076 --> 11:49.908
Hold on just one moment.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.110
Hey, this is not cool.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.745
- Oh, whatever.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.213
- Yes, okay.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.148
Thanks so much.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.853
(phone ringing)

12:02.822 --> 12:03.922
- [Voiceover] What now, Josh?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.256
- I'm right by Beverly
Hills, how about

12:05.258 --> 12:06.524
I pick up the necklace now?

12:06.526 --> 12:07.859
- [Voiceover] No, you're
picking it up Sunday.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.927
Goodbye.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.908
- Fuck this.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.176
- Oh my God!

12:58.178 --> 12:59.744
You're here!

12:59.746 --> 13:00.979
- What happened, ma'am?

13:00.981 --> 13:01.913
- I don't know.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.081
Please, you've gotta help him.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.551
Well he's caught in a riptide.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.124
- Ma'am, I'm afraid we're just
gonna have to let him drown.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.393
- (laughs) Stick to the script.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.695
- Squeak, your food's
in the kitchen, come on.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.230
- Baby, baby, baby.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.800
(laughs)

13:21.802 --> 13:23.635
What's up, good lookin'?

13:23.637 --> 13:24.836
Hi.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.404
- Baby, you didn't
turn the grill on.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.241
- I'm sorry, it's beautiful,
world's best wife.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.812
I love you, I love you.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.413
- Oh, I'll be right back.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.417
Put some pants on!

13:43.823 --> 13:45.990
This is Stacey.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.792
Oh hey.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.361
What?

13:51.697 --> 13:59.337
No, hold on a second.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.777
Are you serious?

14:06.779 --> 14:10.448
Yeah, well a little heads
up would have been nice.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.118
Yeah, but it doesn't matter now.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.757
Yeah.

14:24.196 --> 14:24.863
Okay, fine.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.736
Yeah well you have
a great life too.

14:44.650 --> 14:45.550
- Can I help you?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.851
- Yeah, I've been
ringing this doorbell

14:46.853 --> 14:47.652
for about five minutes.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.853
No one's answering.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.054
The owner around?

14:50.056 --> 14:54.926
- Her car is here,
let me go get her.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.733
- Stacey!

15:01.735 --> 15:03.167
Stace!

15:05.738 --> 15:08.273
Stace, there's
someone here for you.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.377
Stace.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.648
Stacey!

15:27.192 --> 15:29.294
- Ma'am you can
never be too careful.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.229
- Really?

15:31.231 --> 15:32.263
- Hey Michelle.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.164
- Hey, hon.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.132
- Where's Stacey?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.067
There's someone here to see her.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.035
- What's in the bag?

15:37.037 --> 15:38.202
- It's for Campbell's wife.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.737
(laughs)

15:39.739 --> 15:41.472
- You're getting nowhere
working for that guy.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.007
- Yeah, kind of like
your art career.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.142
- Ouch.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.476
- Can we take a look at it?

15:45.478 --> 15:46.377
- What?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.745
- What you got in the bag?

15:47.747 --> 15:49.447
Come on, what is it?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.382
- Uh, it's just a necklace.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.118
- It's not just a
necklace it's a Natalie K.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.887
- Oh, that's heavy.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.356
- Yeah, well, is she upstairs?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.557
- Probably.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.992
- Okay, all right.

16:00.994 --> 16:01.993
- Um, Josh.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.461
- Yes?

16:03.463 --> 16:06.397
- Do you think I can get a
ride to my audition on Monday?

16:06.399 --> 16:07.865
- Car problems?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.600
- No, but if you can't--

16:09.602 --> 16:11.069
- No that sounds awesome.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.637
- [Michelle] Okay, great.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.943
Shall we?

16:18.945 --> 16:21.045
- [Viggs] Oh you're so sexy.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.680
Let's do this.

16:22.682 --> 16:27.018
(hip hop music)

16:31.256 --> 16:32.824
- Stace.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.492
Stace.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.260
- Hi, I'm out here.

16:37.763 --> 16:38.663
Hi.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.897
- Hey.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.833
There's someone here to see you.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.767
- Who?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.202
- I don't know, some guy.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.570
- Did he say what he wants?

16:45.572 --> 16:48.373
- No, he's wearing a suit.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.808
- Lovely, okay.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.143
I will be right down.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.444
- Okay.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.846
- Hey, what's in the bag?

16:54.848 --> 16:55.646
- [Josh] What?

16:55.648 --> 16:56.881
- The bag.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.851
- Oh, I don't know, a
million-dollar necklace.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.521
(smooth electronic music)

17:34.920 --> 17:36.587
I'm up for a
development job, Mom

17:36.589 --> 17:38.990
And yes I would get paid.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.492
All right Mom.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.427
No, breathe.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.062
Okay, breathe.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.898
Yeah, I'll pay you
back, everything.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.134
I promise.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.936
No, lots of people
have interned for like

17:51.938 --> 17:54.839
over a year, even two sometimes

17:54.841 --> 17:57.341
before they get paid.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.646
It's Hollywood, Mom,
I'm livin' the dream.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.214
Yeah, I love you.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.283
All right, tell him I said hi.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.644
- Oh my God!

18:33.646 --> 18:35.313
Yes!

18:35.315 --> 18:36.681
- [Viggs] What's up?

18:36.683 --> 18:37.982
What?

18:37.984 --> 18:39.083
- Is she okay?

18:39.085 --> 18:39.851
Are you okay?

18:39.853 --> 18:41.219
- What's wrong now?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.854
- [Michelle] It's
getting picked up!

18:42.856 --> 18:44.055
- What is getting picked up?

18:44.057 --> 18:45.323
- Cop Rockers!

18:45.325 --> 18:47.425
You know the TV show,
I shot it last spring.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.393
- Oh, maybe now you
can pay the rent.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.496
- I'll get you that
check Monday, I promise.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.797
- So when can we see it?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.500
- Uh, January.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.934
It's coming out in January!

18:56.936 --> 18:58.169
Oh!

18:58.171 --> 19:00.671
But my friend, Billy,
he's got a screener.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.007
Oh my god, can we throw a party?

19:03.009 --> 19:04.976
Oh my God, please
can we throw a party?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.210
It would be amazing!

19:06.212 --> 19:07.612
I would pay for the
drinks and everything,

19:07.614 --> 19:08.679
tomorrow night.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.081
- Right now is not a good time.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.549
- Oh, come on.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.284
Why do you gotta
be such a buzzkill?

19:13.286 --> 19:14.852
- Are you really starting
with me right now, Viggs?

19:14.854 --> 19:16.387
When was the last time
you sold a painting?

19:16.389 --> 19:17.755
- Babe, you know I do
everything around here.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.023
- What do you do?

19:19.025 --> 19:21.859
- I did the dishes, I
fixed the showerhead.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.695
I painted the back door.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.531
- Well maybe you
should read this.

19:26.533 --> 19:30.134
Maybe you should
read it to everyone.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.673
- This notice is a
demand for payment

19:35.675 --> 19:38.442
prior to your foreclosure
on your mortgage.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.978
You've failed to make
any payments in the
last three months,

19:40.980 --> 19:43.447
You must bring the current
mortgage within 14 days

19:43.449 --> 19:45.249
of the date of this
letter show below

19:45.251 --> 19:47.552
the full amount.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.023
Oh man.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.091
That's really fucked up.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.961
But baby, you're a
great songwriter,

19:56.963 --> 20:00.097
just send in your
tunes, get an advance,

20:00.099 --> 20:02.366
you just need one hit, you know?

20:02.368 --> 20:05.536
- Yeah, I sent in my tunes.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.539
- [Viggs] And then
what did they say?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.608
- They dropped me.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.912
- Stace, I'm really sorry.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.781
It must be really tough
being so successful

20:16.783 --> 20:18.216
when you're young.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.283
Now that you're older--

20:19.285 --> 20:21.052
- Thanks.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.821
- I bet Campbell doesn't
have to deal with this shit.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.289
- Why Campbell?

20:25.291 --> 20:27.592
- Guy who buys his wife a
gazillion-dollar necklace

20:27.594 --> 20:29.760
doesn't have to
worry about shit.

20:29.762 --> 20:30.828
- You should see the box, Stace.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.530
- Yeah, he had to
bring it up to his room

20:32.532 --> 20:33.731
to get her to stop drooling.

20:33.733 --> 20:38.469
- Just shut up guys.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.843
Look, if there's anything I
can do to help with the money.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.013
I mean, I don't know
what I can do, but,

20:49.015 --> 20:51.182
just so you know, I'm
here if you need me.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.817
- Nah, it's okay.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.552
You're good, you're
always on time.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.721
Just gonna figure it out, okay?

20:56.723 --> 20:58.956
- All right, you're smart.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.396
- So this Cop Rockers,
is that the uh,

21:05.398 --> 21:07.231
the undercover hooker chick?

21:07.233 --> 21:08.432
- No.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.302
That was a webisode.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.406
This is the one
when the rookie cop

21:15.408 --> 21:17.908
who's got this father
she's never met,

21:17.910 --> 21:20.177
and he's actually
a big-time mob boss

21:20.179 --> 21:21.345
who I'm supposed to bust.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.447
Anyway, there's this
really cool scene

21:23.449 --> 21:26.517
where like, I'm questioning
him, and he knows

21:26.519 --> 21:28.252
I'm his daughter, but
I don't know who he is.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.987
But he knows I don't know.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.890
So he starts dropping
like all these hints,

21:32.892 --> 21:36.294
and I'm like, what's
going on here?

21:36.296 --> 21:40.264
And then at the end (laughs)

21:40.266 --> 21:43.467
Oh, I'm not gonna tell
you, you have to see it.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.403
- I remember that, we were
working on the sets together.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.071
- Oh yeah, that's right!

21:47.073 --> 21:48.706
- Okay.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.940
- What?

21:49.942 --> 21:51.409
- You can throw the party.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.376
- Seriously?

21:52.378 --> 21:53.344
- Absolutely.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.846
- Oh no, no, no, no it's okay.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.982
If you guys will excuse me.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.517
- Thank you so much!

21:59.519 --> 22:01.585
I'm gonna have a party!

22:29.147 --> 22:30.214
(phone dialing)

22:49.901 --> 22:57.308
(upbeat dance music)

23:01.480 --> 23:04.715
- Contour, texture, color.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.084
- Yo man, were you fucked
up when you did this?

23:08.653 --> 23:11.422
- That is cold, man.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.524
Why you gotta say
something like that?

23:13.526 --> 23:15.192
- Just sayin'.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.863
- Gotta get in the right
frame of mind, you know?

23:20.665 --> 23:23.067
- Maybe you oughta start
doing celebrity portraits.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.869
Like Bob Marley and Miley Cyrus.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.204
- [Voiceover] Hey
girl, what's up?

23:27.206 --> 23:30.307
- Maybe I could
paint your vagina.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.244
- Yeah, that'd be good.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.412
- Yeah, yeah.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.481
- I don't know, might
be too tasteful.

24:03.041 --> 24:11.348
- Cheers.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.121
Come on one more, you
are not drunk enough.

24:17.123 --> 24:17.955
- I'm good.

24:17.957 --> 24:18.689
- Come on!

24:18.691 --> 24:19.723
It's a party!

24:19.725 --> 24:20.591
- I can't.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.258
- Come on.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.927
- Every drink needs a home.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.662
- Yes it does.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.364
(whoops)

24:31.503 --> 24:33.471
Oh, Josh can you get that salsa,

24:33.473 --> 24:35.906
I mean, you know, for Stacey,

24:35.908 --> 24:37.274
keeping it clean?

24:37.276 --> 24:38.676
- Yeah, that sounds awesome.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.110
- Sweet.

24:41.546 --> 24:42.847
- You look hot.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.650
- Hey guys!

24:46.652 --> 24:49.553
Cop Rockers, Michelle's
pilot, it's starting now!

24:53.425 --> 24:55.359
- Hang on, I got this.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.931
- Wait, I think I see something.

25:00.933 --> 25:10.374
Sunset and Everly, three
suspects, possibly armed.

25:14.646 --> 25:16.146
- [Voiceover] Go, go!

25:18.650 --> 25:19.683
- [Michelle] Dirk!

25:19.685 --> 25:22.753
(laughter and groaning)

25:23.922 --> 25:24.822
You're gonna be okay.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.056
- Everything's dark.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.791
- Yeah, well, I need
to tell you something.

25:27.793 --> 25:28.592
- What?

25:28.594 --> 25:30.494
- I love you.

25:30.496 --> 25:34.398
(clapping and laughter)

25:35.467 --> 25:36.734
- Ah that's great.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.169
I don't know why it's so funny.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.539
(laughs)

25:41.541 --> 25:43.240
- Please check out
the art, everybody,

25:43.242 --> 25:45.543
great artist.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.612
- [Voiceover] Well done,
Michelle that was great.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.981
- Oh no, no, no hey Squeaky.

25:50.983 --> 25:54.118
No, no, no it's okay.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.421
Yeah, of all the dogs Squeaky's
the one that can't bark.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.822
And he eats like
a fucking horse.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.324
Viggs!

26:00.326 --> 26:01.559
Viggs!

26:01.561 --> 26:02.826
- Hey, what's up baby?

26:02.828 --> 26:04.662
- Can you please put the
dog away in the studio?

26:04.664 --> 26:06.430
- Yeah, I'm just, I'm showin'
my art right now, so--

26:06.432 --> 26:08.132
- Now, please.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.500
- Don't tell me what to do.

26:09.502 --> 26:11.035
- Baby, we're throwing a party.

26:11.037 --> 26:11.969
- No, I--

26:11.971 --> 26:13.237
- Put the dog away!

26:13.239 --> 26:14.004
Now.

26:14.006 --> 26:14.972
- I will do that.

26:14.974 --> 26:15.906
I just wanted to--

26:15.908 --> 26:17.341
- I can't do this right now.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.509
Just please put the dog away.

26:18.511 --> 26:20.311
- Yes, ma'am.

26:24.382 --> 26:25.716
- I looked everywhere.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.085
- I fucking looked
everywhere, too.

26:29.487 --> 26:30.921
- We gotta go to plan B.

26:30.923 --> 26:31.589
- Are you sure?

26:31.591 --> 26:33.190
Fuck.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.226
- Squeaksy!

26:36.228 --> 26:37.695
(whistles)

26:37.697 --> 26:39.396
Squeaks.

26:43.168 --> 26:46.270
- Hey, Romeo, time to
hightail it out of here.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.238
The host asked me to start
clearing everyone out.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.241
- It's not even midnight yet.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.982
- I'm asking you nicely.

27:27.712 --> 27:29.747
Party's over, everybody!

27:30.815 --> 27:32.783
- Don't bother,
man, they're out.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.884
- Fuck.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.023
(whistling)

27:54.906 --> 27:56.073
- Hey asshole.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.075
Squeaks.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.310
Hey, buddy, come on.

28:02.147 --> 28:05.349
Holy shit.

28:09.888 --> 28:18.362
- Fuck.

28:22.534 --> 28:27.204
- Get over here, get over.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.043
Oh yeah buddy.

28:36.614 --> 28:39.683
I'm sorry, buddy, daddy's
gotta do some work.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.772
- Party sure died fast.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.341
- Hey.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.746
- I know it's a drag,
but you gotta remember

29:10.215 --> 29:12.583
it's you on that
screen up there.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.687
No one can take
that away from you.

29:16.689 --> 29:18.021
- Thanks.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.557
- The bitch lied to us.

29:20.559 --> 29:24.261
- This is fucked up, sis.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.865
- Yo, you gotta calm down, okay?

29:27.867 --> 29:28.766
We talked about this shit.

29:28.768 --> 29:29.900
- I don't know, sis.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.503
- Everything's gonna be fine.

29:32.505 --> 29:38.041
Let's go.

29:42.347 --> 29:48.886
- I'm proud of you.

29:53.057 --> 29:55.225
- You're really sweet, Josh.

29:57.595 --> 29:58.762
- I'm sorry.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.831
- No, no, I'm sorry.

30:18.449 --> 30:19.817
- Get inside.

30:20.585 --> 30:22.119
Now!

30:22.520 --> 30:25.789
- Viggs, get back here and
help me clean this place.

30:25.791 --> 30:26.890
No, now!

30:26.892 --> 30:27.791
- Bitch!

30:27.793 --> 30:29.193
Hang the phone up

30:29.195 --> 30:31.361
and come with me.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.763
Come on!

30:33.765 --> 30:35.632
- Get in the fuckin' room!

30:35.634 --> 30:37.734
Sit, sit!

30:38.703 --> 30:39.503
Don't move.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.872
(screams)

30:41.874 --> 30:42.806
- [Man] Come on!

30:42.808 --> 30:43.774
Hurry up!

30:43.776 --> 30:44.842
Come on!

30:44.844 --> 30:46.210
Think I'm fucking joking?

30:46.212 --> 30:46.977
- [Woman] Go.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.111
Sit the fuck down!

30:48.113 --> 30:49.213
- Get on the fucking floor!

30:49.215 --> 30:50.414
Get the fuck on the floor!

30:50.416 --> 30:51.849
Are you bitches
fucking deaf or what?

30:51.851 --> 30:53.750
- [Woman] That wannabe
artist, where is he?

30:53.752 --> 30:56.220
- [Voiceover] Where the
fuck is your husband?

31:00.358 --> 31:07.698
- [Voiceover] Shut the fuck up.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.371
- Drop the fucking axe.

31:16.274 --> 31:17.875
- Now give me your phone.

31:17.877 --> 31:18.775
Give me your phone!

31:18.777 --> 31:20.310
- It's in my back pocket.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.979
- Sit your ass down.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.448
- I don't have it.
- Give him your fuckin' phone.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.616
- Gimme your phone.
Gimme your phone!

31:25.618 --> 31:26.917
- it's in my left
pocket, no left.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.152
Yeah.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.687
- You don't have a
phone, sweetheart?

31:30.689 --> 31:31.555
Where's your fuckin' phone, huh?

31:31.557 --> 31:33.724
- You don't have a
fucking cell phone?

31:33.726 --> 31:35.092
- I already gave it to him!

31:35.094 --> 31:36.393
I gave it to him.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.828
- Okay.

31:37.830 --> 31:40.063
So you do what I
say and everyone

31:40.065 --> 31:41.865
gets out of this peachy keen.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.200
- Yeah, peachy keen.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.935
- Shut the fuck up.

31:44.937 --> 31:48.071
You don't do what I say and
there's gonna be trouble.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.172
Got it?

31:49.174 --> 31:51.108
The diamond necklace,
where is it?

31:51.110 --> 31:51.975
- Who are you?

31:51.977 --> 31:53.277
- Answer the question!

31:53.279 --> 31:55.846
- [Man] Answer her!

31:55.848 --> 31:57.247
- This is your fault.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.149
- My fault?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.651
How the fuck is this my fault?

32:00.653 --> 32:02.452
- You had to open your big
fuckin' mouth about this shit.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.654
- Yeah, you're the dipshit

32:03.656 --> 32:04.855
that brought the
fuckin' necklace here.

32:04.857 --> 32:06.556
- At least I'm some hack
artist sponging off his wife.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.624
- Fuck you!

32:07.626 --> 32:09.259
(shouting)

32:09.261 --> 32:12.195
- Knock it off, assholes!

32:12.197 --> 32:15.365
This isn't he motherfuckin'
Dr. Phil Show, is it?

32:15.367 --> 32:17.367
All right, the sooner
you tell me where it is,

32:17.369 --> 32:18.735
the sooner you can get
back to your dysfunctional

32:18.737 --> 32:20.304
fucking lives.

32:20.306 --> 32:23.640
So, tell me.

32:25.009 --> 32:25.876
- What're you waiting for?

32:25.878 --> 32:26.643
Tell her!

32:26.645 --> 32:27.644
- Tell me!

32:27.646 --> 32:30.514
- It's under my bed.

32:34.352 --> 32:37.454
- I thought you said you
already looked there!

32:37.456 --> 32:38.889
- Fuckin' get up there.

32:38.891 --> 32:40.190
Get up there.

32:40.192 --> 32:48.598
Go.

32:53.004 --> 32:55.072
- Fuck, fuck.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.824
I can't find it, sis!

33:13.826 --> 33:16.393
- Check the other goddamn rooms!

33:17.428 --> 33:18.495
- Fuck.

33:28.573 --> 33:29.639
(panting)

33:44.288 --> 33:45.422
- Your wife knows you're a hack.

33:45.424 --> 33:46.256
- Yo, fuck you.

33:46.258 --> 33:46.890
You know--

33:46.892 --> 33:48.692
- Quiet!

33:49.894 --> 33:51.061
- Bro, come on, man.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.062
- Hey, sis.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.798
Check this out, sis.

33:55.967 --> 33:58.268
- I'm starting to get a
little frustrated here.

34:00.271 --> 34:02.172
So are you gonna be
difficult or are you

34:02.174 --> 34:04.241
gonna give me what I want?

34:04.243 --> 34:05.342
- I wasn't lying.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.810
It's under my (scream)

34:06.812 --> 34:09.279
- I'm sick of this
fuckin' horseshit!

34:09.281 --> 34:10.414
don't even go there.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.716
- Oh shit!

34:12.717 --> 34:15.418
Bitch, I swear to God,
you try that shit again

34:15.420 --> 34:17.920
I will not hesitate to put a
fuckin' bullet in your head,

34:17.922 --> 34:19.089
got it?

34:19.091 --> 34:20.724
Now.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.858
You good?

34:21.860 --> 34:24.561
(man panting)

34:24.563 --> 34:30.100
Any of you so much as move.

34:34.539 --> 34:35.639
Calm down.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.373
Hey, hey, I'm right here.

34:37.376 --> 34:38.942
- This was not the plan.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.878
You didn't say we would
be hurting people.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.480
I'll just get the money
some other way, sis.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.183
- How do you plan on
getting the cash, Del?

34:46.185 --> 34:47.083
- I don't know.

34:47.085 --> 34:47.751
- That's right.

34:47.753 --> 34:48.819
You don't know.

34:48.821 --> 34:50.286
You're in the whole for $20,000.

34:50.289 --> 34:53.556
I don't know, that's
not gonna cut it.

34:53.559 --> 34:57.260
And I know for a
fact that Nestor,

34:57.262 --> 35:00.363
okay, doesn't take
no for an answer.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.899
- What the fuck
is going on, guys?

35:02.901 --> 35:04.301
- I don't know.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.736
I think something's wrong
with him or something.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.139
- Listen, I am doing this
for you, little brother,

35:09.141 --> 35:10.340
all right?

35:10.342 --> 35:12.309
So perk the fuck up,
get your shit together.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.076
- Okay.

35:13.078 --> 35:13.944
- Okay?

35:13.946 --> 35:14.811
We're doing this.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.446
It's going down.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.782
- It's gonna be
okay, sis, right?

35:19.817 --> 35:21.952
- Right.

35:21.954 --> 35:22.886
- Okay!

35:22.888 --> 35:24.321
Enough with these damn things!

35:24.323 --> 35:25.689
One of you is gonna talk!

35:25.691 --> 35:28.058
- You want something
to cry about, honey?

35:28.060 --> 35:30.627
How about that shitty
acting of yours, huh?

35:32.063 --> 35:33.196
Pretty girl.

35:33.198 --> 35:35.198
Not for long.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.934
Your little starlet
days are over honey.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.636
Unless someone starts
talking to me here real fast.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.138
- It's under my bed, I swear!

35:41.140 --> 35:42.172
I just looked there!

35:42.174 --> 35:43.206
- Real fast!

35:43.208 --> 35:44.040
- Don't fuckin' touch her!

35:44.042 --> 35:45.041
- You shut up!

35:45.043 --> 35:45.809
Shut up!

35:45.811 --> 35:46.710
- Don't do it!

35:46.712 --> 35:47.611
- Leave her alone, please!

35:47.613 --> 35:48.545
- Don't fuckin' touch her!

35:48.547 --> 35:51.248
- Please don't kill me, please!

35:51.250 --> 35:52.616
- Search the fuckin' room again.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.484
- Get your ass up!

35:54.486 --> 35:55.585
Get your ass up!

35:55.587 --> 35:56.386
Come on.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.053
- [Josh] Okay.

35:57.055 --> 35:57.988
- [Del] Get up!

35:57.990 --> 35:59.523
- Josh.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.595
- Tired of you punk asses!

36:05.597 --> 36:07.130
What the fuck are you doing?

36:07.132 --> 36:08.098
Get up!

36:08.100 --> 36:09.432
Get the fuck off the bed.

36:09.434 --> 36:12.035
Get the fuck off the bed.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.036
Where's it at?

36:13.038 --> 36:13.904
- You okay, man?

36:13.906 --> 36:15.071
- Where the fuck
is the necklace!

36:15.073 --> 36:16.239
- It's under my bed.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.275
- Get your ass down
there and get it.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.577
- Do you mind? -
[Del] She won't like that man.

36:20.579 --> 36:21.878
- Okay, well how
do you expect me--

36:21.880 --> 36:22.779
- Do it!

36:22.781 --> 36:23.446
- Okay.

36:23.448 --> 36:24.214
- What the fuck?

36:24.216 --> 36:26.683
Is it there or what?

36:27.718 --> 36:29.653
You see it?

36:30.588 --> 36:32.522
- Yeah, it's there.

36:33.891 --> 36:35.392
- Just sit your ass down!

36:36.127 --> 36:38.094
See I'll go down and
fuckin' get it myself.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.162
- You don't have to worry about,

36:39.164 --> 36:40.197
you don't have to do that.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.464
I just want this to be over.

36:41.466 --> 36:45.402
- You think I'm gonna
fuckin' take chances?

36:45.404 --> 36:48.905
Motherfucker!

36:48.907 --> 36:50.473
(gunshot)

36:50.475 --> 36:51.408
- Josh!

36:51.410 --> 36:52.576
- Shut the fuck up!

36:52.578 --> 36:54.177
Shut up!

36:54.179 --> 36:55.212
Del!

36:55.214 --> 36:57.747
The fuck's going on up there?

36:59.317 --> 37:00.250
Del?

37:00.252 --> 37:02.219
Get the fuck away!

37:04.188 --> 37:05.222
- Ow!

37:05.224 --> 37:07.123
- Shut up!

37:07.125 --> 37:08.792
Come here!

37:08.794 --> 37:12.762
Come on!

37:17.235 --> 37:18.168
Get up.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.336
Get the fuck up!

37:19.338 --> 37:20.604
- No, no, no!

37:20.606 --> 37:21.838
- No, no, stop!

37:21.840 --> 37:23.173
- Shut up, fuckin' bitch.

37:23.175 --> 37:24.207
Get up.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.242
Get up!

37:25.244 --> 37:27.010
- Okay, it's okay.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.880
- Go!

37:30.882 --> 37:32.582
- [Stacey] Viggs!

37:34.352 --> 37:39.990
- Go!

37:44.562 --> 37:45.495
Hey.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.930
Hey, hey, hey.

37:49.033 --> 37:51.501
No man, you're gonna be okay.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.269
- Sister Amber.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.336
- No, you're gonna be okay.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.505
- Sister.

38:00.044 --> 38:02.178
(crying)

38:04.749 --> 38:10.220
- Baby brother?

38:14.358 --> 38:15.692
You're history, motherfucker!

38:15.694 --> 38:16.760
(gunshot)

38:29.240 --> 38:30.307
(screams)

38:42.353 --> 38:44.087
- [Stacey] Viggs!

38:45.523 --> 38:46.656
Viggs!

38:46.658 --> 38:48.858
- Okay.

38:50.528 --> 38:52.629
- Okay, Josh, Josh.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.365
Oh fuck, oh fuck.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.867
Oh, buddy.

38:57.869 --> 39:01.004
Oh, fuck.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.843
Come on you motherfucker.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.646

39:10.614 --> 39:12.048
Oh come on you motherfucker!

39:12.050 --> 39:13.917
Come on!

39:14.885 --> 39:22.058
Come on!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.031
- [Stacey] Viggs!

39:32.570 --> 39:35.705
(crying)

39:38.442 --> 39:40.009
- Hey buddy!

39:40.978 --> 39:42.479
Fuck.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.947
(laughs)

39:43.949 --> 39:45.348
Hey buddy.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.916
You okay?

39:46.918 --> 39:47.584
- My hands!

39:47.586 --> 39:48.385
My hands!

39:48.387 --> 39:51.621
- Okay, Jesus, okay.

39:56.026 --> 39:57.727
Easy there, bro.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.231
All right, come on.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.665
We gotta get you to a hospital.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.401
- I put it under my bed.

40:04.403 --> 40:07.103
I put it under, where
did it, where did it go?

40:07.105 --> 40:08.638
Where did it go?

40:08.640 --> 40:11.775
Because it was there
not, these people,

40:11.777 --> 40:13.243
I saw them and they
were at the party

40:13.245 --> 40:14.144
and you saw them too, right?

40:14.146 --> 40:14.944
You saw them, right?

40:14.946 --> 40:15.845
You saw them!

40:15.847 --> 40:17.781
I saw them!

40:17.783 --> 40:19.616
It doesn't make any sense.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.485
Jeez, where the fuck did it go?

40:22.487 --> 40:23.620
- [Stacey] Viggs!

40:25.389 --> 40:26.356
Viggs!

40:26.358 --> 40:28.358
- We gotta get you
outta here, man.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.692
You want me to
call an ambulance?

40:29.694 --> 40:31.060
- No, no, no, no.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.362
Please don't 'cause
you'll call the ambulance

40:32.364 --> 40:34.297
and then they come here and
then they'll see him and then--

40:34.299 --> 40:35.198
- All right, I'll,

40:35.200 --> 40:37.333
- I've worked for Campbell
for a whole fuckin' year.

40:37.335 --> 40:38.001
- Don't move.

40:38.003 --> 40:38.902
- A whole year.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.103
There's, it's just.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.538
- [Viggs] Don't move.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.474
You're alive, buddy.

40:47.144 --> 40:48.511
- I'm alive.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.547
- [Viggs] How's that?

40:50.549 --> 40:52.549
How's that?

40:52.551 --> 40:53.883
Okay?

40:53.885 --> 40:56.186
I got some Vicodin in
my room, all right?

40:56.188 --> 40:57.153
- All right, all right.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.321
Just don't call an ambulance.

40:58.323 --> 40:59.055
- [Viggs] I'm not.

40:59.057 --> 41:00.256
- All right.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.157
- Hey, Josh?

41:01.159 --> 41:02.258
- Yeah?

41:02.260 --> 41:04.260
- You're fuckin' alive!

41:04.262 --> 41:06.863
You're alive, Josh!

41:07.965 --> 41:09.866
Hey, keep an eye on her.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.367
- I'll keep an eye.

41:13.270 --> 41:14.204
- Viggs!

41:14.206 --> 41:15.572
- Oh my God, what the fuck?

41:16.507 --> 41:17.507
- Viggs!

41:17.509 --> 41:24.347
What is happening up there!

41:28.886 --> 41:30.353
Viggs!

41:32.256 --> 41:40.697
Viggs!

41:44.869 --> 41:46.402
- What's the max I can take?

41:46.404 --> 41:50.573
- Fuckin' always say one
every four hours or so.

41:50.575 --> 41:53.042
- Okay, all right.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.378
Let's just wake her up, man.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.885
- Jesus Christ, what
the hell happened?

42:01.887 --> 42:02.819
- I saved his life.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.554
- Funny way of putting it.

42:08.058 --> 42:10.093
- She was at the party.

42:12.329 --> 42:13.563
- Let me take a look at you.

42:13.565 --> 42:14.964
Baby, go get my first aid kit.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.566
- The guy needs a
doctor and a fuckin'--

42:16.568 --> 42:18.601
- Just do it!

42:18.603 --> 42:24.407
Go get my mask from the freezer.

42:28.812 --> 42:30.813
The other one?

42:31.949 --> 42:33.583
- Dead.

42:34.618 --> 42:36.319
I went for his gun, it
went off accidentally.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.521
- [Michelle] Here.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.390
- Okay, this will keep
the swelling down.

42:41.458 --> 42:43.860
- This gig of yours is a crock!

42:47.698 --> 42:49.198
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.633
- Oh please.

42:50.635 --> 42:53.069
You know exactly what the
fuck I'm talking about.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.304
Come on.

42:54.306 --> 42:56.706
This bitch hired us
to steal the necklace.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.174
- She's crazy!

42:58.176 --> 43:00.910
- She said she'd cut us in
for $20,000 when she sold it.

43:00.912 --> 43:04.814
Now Del's dead and it was
all for shit, you know?

43:04.816 --> 43:06.215
I'm fucked because of it.

43:06.217 --> 43:07.450
- That's bullshit!

43:07.452 --> 43:08.685
Are you gonna gag
her or something?

43:08.687 --> 43:10.186
- Then how the fuck
did I know there was

43:10.188 --> 43:12.322
a necklace here?

43:12.324 --> 43:14.791
- What the hell, you knew.

43:14.793 --> 43:17.260
- Josh, everyone knew.

43:17.262 --> 43:19.829
I mean, Michelle knew,
she could've done it.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.564
- Seriously?

43:21.566 --> 43:22.332
Fuck you, Stacey.

43:22.334 --> 43:23.199
- All right, okay.

43:23.201 --> 43:23.833
- Fuck you!

43:23.835 --> 43:24.634
- Fuck you!

43:24.636 --> 43:25.535
- No, no, hold on here.

43:25.537 --> 43:26.703
- Oh wake the fuck up!

43:26.705 --> 43:28.738
It was her.

43:28.740 --> 43:30.540
The mortgage?

43:30.542 --> 43:33.142
She told us all about it.

43:33.144 --> 43:35.411
- Josh come on.

43:36.413 --> 43:38.648
- I never would have thought.

43:38.650 --> 43:40.216
So Stacy hired you.

43:43.821 --> 43:45.455
And your brother?

43:49.760 --> 43:51.094
What's your name?

43:52.296 --> 43:53.329
- Amber.

43:55.399 --> 43:57.533
It was Del that you shot.

43:58.736 --> 44:00.269
- It was an accident.

44:01.238 --> 44:02.772
- Was it?

44:02.774 --> 44:04.841
- Hey, in my pocket.

44:26.030 --> 44:28.498
Shit rolls downhill, don't it?

44:36.306 --> 44:38.241
- You lying fucking whore!

44:38.243 --> 44:40.176
And I even gave you
a deal on the rent!

44:40.178 --> 44:41.678
- You're fucking crazy!

44:41.680 --> 44:43.413
- You fucked my husband
in my own fucking--

44:43.415 --> 44:44.514
- Stop it!

44:44.516 --> 44:46.783
You shut the fuck up!

44:46.785 --> 44:49.719
Sit on the fuckin' couch.

44:51.088 --> 44:52.955
Quicker please, thank you.

44:54.391 --> 44:55.858
When did she hire you?

44:55.860 --> 44:57.493
- Last night.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.629
She said you had some
high-end necklace.

44:59.631 --> 45:01.664
- She say where it was?

45:01.666 --> 45:03.232
- Your room.

45:03.234 --> 45:04.167
- Josh, please--

45:04.169 --> 45:07.070
- Shut up, shut up.

45:07.072 --> 45:11.507
So you had no idea
the necklace was gone?

45:15.713 --> 45:17.513
- It wasn't me, Josh!

45:17.515 --> 45:19.515
I mean, we should be calling
the police right now.

45:19.517 --> 45:21.084
There's a dead guy upstairs!

45:21.086 --> 45:22.452
- His name is Del!

45:22.454 --> 45:24.287
- This is about the
best I could do.

45:24.289 --> 45:25.722
- You cheater.

45:25.724 --> 45:26.889
Fucking bastard!

45:26.891 --> 45:28.758
After everything
I've done for you!

45:28.760 --> 45:30.793
- What the fuck's going on?

45:30.795 --> 45:32.895
- She saw the traffic ticket.

45:32.897 --> 45:36.833
- I told you to fuckin'
burn that thing.

45:41.105 --> 45:43.206
No baby, it wasn't me.

45:43.208 --> 45:44.273
- Bullshit!

45:44.275 --> 45:45.808
It's a fucking image of the side

45:45.810 --> 45:47.243
of your fucking face!

45:47.245 --> 45:48.644
- Stop.

45:48.646 --> 45:49.679
- After supporting your career?

45:49.681 --> 45:50.913
Asshole!

45:50.915 --> 45:52.348
No formal training?

45:52.350 --> 45:53.516
Yeah, no shit.

45:53.518 --> 45:54.951
You can't even draw
a fucking flower.

45:54.953 --> 45:57.053
- Have you never hear of
abstract impressionism before?

45:57.055 --> 45:59.722
- It's called expressionism
you fucking idiot.

46:02.326 --> 46:04.360
- The fuck is this?

46:04.362 --> 46:05.928
- Stacey and Michelle
were inside the house

46:05.930 --> 46:08.231
the whole night.

46:08.233 --> 46:10.700
And you were outside
until she took charge.

46:10.702 --> 46:20.143
So you tell me who has
the fuckin' necklace.

46:24.681 --> 46:34.290
(laughs)

46:38.462 --> 46:41.464
- Now listen up, brother.

46:41.466 --> 46:44.066
See, what I got here
is an opportunity.

46:45.569 --> 46:49.005
No way I'm just gonna let
it pass me by, you know?

46:50.007 --> 46:51.874
Every man for himself, right?

46:51.876 --> 46:54.644
- I just need that
necklace back.

46:55.846 --> 46:57.847
(knocking)

47:00.751 --> 47:01.851
Get the door.

47:01.853 --> 47:03.319
- And turn my back on you?

47:03.321 --> 47:05.288
No, fuck no.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.291
(knocking)

47:08.293 --> 47:09.392
- Hello?

47:09.394 --> 47:11.527
- What're you gonna do, Josh?

47:11.529 --> 47:13.996
Are you gonna fuckin' kill me?

47:25.609 --> 47:28.444
You and me, we're
gonna finish this.

47:29.413 --> 47:32.148
Understand?

47:36.453 --> 47:37.620
Hi, how's it goin'?

47:37.622 --> 47:38.921
- Oh, good, good, thanks.

47:38.923 --> 47:39.889
- Great, wonderful.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.291
- Listen, sorry to bother you.

47:42.293 --> 47:43.726
- Not a problem.

47:43.728 --> 47:46.696
- It's probably none of
my business, but you know

47:46.698 --> 47:47.763
my wife, Jenny.

47:47.765 --> 47:48.998
- Right, right yeah.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.034
- She swears she heard
gunshots from over here.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.102
- Oh man, no.

47:53.104 --> 47:58.341
We were just
partying, that's it.

48:02.613 --> 48:04.714
- So everybody's okay?

48:04.716 --> 48:06.549
- Oh yeah, no, no, we were just,

48:06.551 --> 48:08.284
we were watching this screening,

48:08.286 --> 48:10.253
this cop show.

48:10.255 --> 48:11.621
So maybe that was it.

48:11.623 --> 48:13.155
- Oh.

48:16.059 --> 48:18.661
Maybe if you could just dial
it down a little, just so--

48:18.663 --> 48:19.996
- Yeah, yes.

48:19.998 --> 48:21.597
Yes, I'm so sorry.

48:21.599 --> 48:23.199
- Okay, all right.

48:23.201 --> 48:25.268
Good night.

48:43.487 --> 48:44.553
(screaming)

48:59.169 --> 49:05.975
- I wouldn't recommend that.

49:10.247 --> 49:11.781
Where's the necklace?

49:11.783 --> 49:13.449
- Or what?

49:14.418 --> 49:16.686
Time's running out for you, bro.

49:16.688 --> 49:19.755
No and I'm bettin'
that you're not

49:19.757 --> 49:22.725
gonna put your life on
the life for a necklace.

49:22.727 --> 49:25.528
Not even if it was your own.

49:25.530 --> 49:27.830
It would be stupid if you did.

49:27.832 --> 49:30.099
Now you and me, maybe
we make an arrangement.

49:30.101 --> 49:32.301
Keep things mano-a-mano.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.036
You know what I'm saying?

49:36.540 --> 49:38.040
Not a good idea, bro.

49:38.042 --> 49:41.777
Without me, you're never
getting that necklace back.

49:41.779 --> 49:42.845
- Stop it!

49:42.847 --> 49:45.715
You're fucking crazy!

49:48.085 --> 49:49.452
Fuck this.

49:50.420 --> 49:51.854
- Missy, you do
that and I guarantee

49:51.856 --> 49:53.789
that you will not
see me tomorrow.

49:53.791 --> 49:56.058
- I'm done, Josh.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.493
I'm done.

49:58.462 --> 50:00.296
(screams)

50:00.298 --> 50:02.665
- That was a warning.

50:02.667 --> 50:05.935
And an improvement.

50:05.937 --> 50:07.870
- What the fuck are
you laughin' at, huh?

50:07.872 --> 50:09.939
- Your roommate's not
gonna let you leave.

50:09.941 --> 50:11.707
We cut all the phone lines.

50:11.709 --> 50:12.975
Internet, too.

50:12.977 --> 50:15.177
And we hid your
fucking cell phones.

50:15.179 --> 50:17.079
You guys are fucked.

50:18.782 --> 50:19.749
- What's it gonna be?

50:19.751 --> 50:20.950
- Baby, baby.

50:20.952 --> 50:23.219
Just tell him where it is.

50:23.221 --> 50:24.653
- Are you gonna tell me?

50:24.655 --> 50:26.188
- Look, I don't know shit
about this fucking necklace!

50:26.190 --> 50:27.823
Just tell him!

50:27.825 --> 50:28.691
- Baby, yeah.

50:28.693 --> 50:30.659
- You should get out
of the fuckin' way.

50:30.661 --> 50:31.560
- No, just tell him.

50:31.562 --> 50:32.728
- Get out of the (screams)

50:32.730 --> 50:33.829
- What's it gonna
be, my brother?

50:33.831 --> 50:35.798
It's your choice, asshole.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.801
- Didn't think things
through, did you, Picasso.

50:38.803 --> 50:41.270
(crying)

50:41.272 --> 50:42.571
- Shut up.

50:43.473 --> 50:44.740
It's been real.

50:46.610 --> 50:47.943
Ready?

50:47.945 --> 50:49.111
- Don't.

50:49.113 --> 50:50.546
- Set.

50:50.548 --> 50:53.682
- It's in my studio.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.618
I said it's in my
fuckin' studio.

50:55.620 --> 50:56.519
- Great.

50:56.521 --> 50:58.687
Go fuckin' get it.

50:59.990 --> 51:00.990
The fuck are you waiting for?

51:00.992 --> 51:03.225
Go fuckin' get it!

51:04.561 --> 51:05.928
- All right, whatever you say.

51:07.931 --> 51:09.999
- You got 60 seconds.

51:18.809 --> 51:19.875
- Fuck.

51:28.385 --> 51:29.452
- Four.

51:44.534 --> 51:46.202
- You gonna sit down?

51:47.337 --> 51:48.671
Wait, dude, don't.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.473
Come here.

51:50.475 --> 51:51.407
Turn around.

51:51.409 --> 51:52.074
- Why?

51:52.076 --> 51:52.775
- Turn around.

51:52.777 --> 51:53.576
- Why?

51:53.578 --> 51:56.712
- Turn the fuck around!

52:00.851 --> 52:02.451
- Give the guy an A for effort.

52:02.453 --> 52:03.519
- Sit the fuck down.

52:36.253 --> 52:37.753
We gotta wrap this up.

52:37.755 --> 52:39.989
'Cause I gotta get outta here.

52:39.991 --> 52:42.758
We got a dead body upstairs.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.794
A dead criminal, to be exact.

52:45.796 --> 52:51.300
Sorry.

52:55.605 --> 52:56.438
I say we bury him.

52:56.440 --> 52:57.506
- Josh, no.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.641
Call the police, please.

52:58.643 --> 52:59.575
Please.

52:59.577 --> 53:01.243
- What, call the police?

53:01.245 --> 53:03.846
- Because I accidentally
killed someone who was hired

53:03.848 --> 53:06.348
by my landlord to rob me?

53:06.350 --> 53:08.484
See where I'm going with this?

53:08.486 --> 53:12.488
Cops get involved, they'll
find out all about the robbery.

53:14.391 --> 53:17.293
They'll find out about
the second robbery.

53:17.295 --> 53:20.863
they they find out who hired
Jack and Jill over here.

53:20.865 --> 53:24.633
If that happens, I'm going
down for manslaughter.

53:25.902 --> 53:26.936
- What about self defense?

53:26.938 --> 53:27.836
- Who gives a shit?

53:27.838 --> 53:29.572
Del's dead because of him.

53:29.574 --> 53:33.676
- I'm really sorry about that.

53:37.547 --> 53:39.949
But I'm not going to
jail for this, okay?

53:39.951 --> 53:41.951
I didn't bust my
ass for over a year

53:41.953 --> 53:44.320
to get done in by
assholes like you.

53:45.455 --> 53:47.523
Oh, self preservation.

53:47.525 --> 53:50.226
That is the operative word here.

53:52.562 --> 53:55.831
We keep quiet about the body,

53:55.833 --> 53:58.601
no one has to find out
about the robberies.

53:58.603 --> 54:01.370
We just got his
loose end right here.

54:01.372 --> 54:04.206
It's a fucked up situation

54:04.208 --> 54:08.244
but what other
option do we have?

54:12.182 --> 54:14.617
- Just talk to me for a
second? - I'm not
calling the cops, okay?

54:14.619 --> 54:16.185
- I'm not gonna call the cops!

54:16.187 --> 54:17.953
Okay.

54:19.789 --> 54:22.992
You're a good guy, Josh.

54:22.994 --> 54:25.527
This isn't you.

54:29.232 --> 54:32.434
I always thought that
maybe we could be together.

54:34.204 --> 54:35.471
- I always liked you.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.775
I had a crush on
you since day one.

54:42.479 --> 54:45.314
You know,

54:47.350 --> 54:50.119
you and me,

54:50.121 --> 54:52.288
we could've had
something you know?

54:53.857 --> 54:59.261
It would've been great.

55:03.400 --> 55:08.904
Never too late though, you know?

55:13.209 --> 55:16.111
I'll tell you what.

55:16.113 --> 55:17.780
Know what we need?

55:17.782 --> 55:20.382
- What?

55:20.384 --> 55:22.551
- We need to bond, right?

55:24.888 --> 55:34.897
- Josh.

55:39.436 --> 55:40.302
What?

55:40.304 --> 55:41.904
- Now take her out.

55:41.906 --> 55:43.672
- Woman said she
wouldn't hesitate

55:43.674 --> 55:45.007
to put a bullet in your head.

55:45.009 --> 55:46.608
- I'd return the favor.

55:46.610 --> 55:48.377
- I can't.

55:48.379 --> 55:49.678
- I said take her out.

55:49.680 --> 55:50.879
- What the fuck are you doing?

55:50.881 --> 55:52.147
What the fuck are you doing?

55:52.149 --> 55:53.215
- You have five fuckin' seconds.

55:53.217 --> 55:54.583
now fuckin' do it.

55:54.585 --> 55:57.353
- Josh, you've lost your mind.

55:57.355 --> 55:58.787
- I've lost my mind?

55:58.789 --> 56:00.489
- You're gonna have her
shoot her and then what, huh?

56:00.491 --> 56:02.157
Who's to say that we don't talk?

56:02.159 --> 56:04.493
Then what, you're
gonna kill us too, huh?

56:04.495 --> 56:05.794
- Pull the fuckin' trigger.

56:05.796 --> 56:07.029
I don't care anymore.

56:07.031 --> 56:07.930
Just do it.

56:07.932 --> 56:09.131
Fucking do it.

56:09.133 --> 56:10.399
- You need to think
about this, please.

56:10.401 --> 56:15.938
Just really think about this.

56:19.809 --> 56:21.110
- You and your
fuckin' reasoning.

56:21.112 --> 56:24.012
I don't even fucking
understand it!

56:24.014 --> 56:26.482
Weren't afraid to
fuckin' start this shit.

56:40.597 --> 56:42.197
Don't get the wrong idea, okay.

56:42.199 --> 56:44.166
I'm not done with you yet.

56:45.201 --> 56:47.269
- Hey, hey.

56:59.516 --> 57:00.783
I'm not gonna go anywhere, man.

57:00.785 --> 57:03.986
- All right, well you
just let me do it.

57:05.155 --> 57:06.221
- Pull on it harder.

57:06.223 --> 57:07.790
- You wanna tape yourself up?

57:11.628 --> 57:16.565
- So what's your plan?

57:20.970 --> 57:22.704
- Fuckin' dig!

57:24.541 --> 57:26.141
- Blows your fuckin' mind, huh?

57:27.610 --> 57:29.044
- [Josh] Okay, good.

57:29.046 --> 57:31.079
I'll see you in about an hour.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.349
- Gotta do something.

58:06.816 --> 58:10.085
- You want out of here, you
need to start helping me.

58:12.789 --> 58:14.490
- Those aren't good
for you, you know.

58:16.893 --> 58:18.460
What're you gonna do with me?

58:18.462 --> 58:20.729
- That's up to you.

58:20.731 --> 58:22.364
I just need you to
forget about everything

58:22.366 --> 58:24.733
that's happened tonight.

58:27.770 --> 58:29.371
- I can't do that.

58:29.373 --> 58:30.506
- Of course, I know.

58:30.508 --> 58:32.875
You know, I wouldn't
expect you to.

58:32.877 --> 58:35.544
I just need this whole
night to be over.

58:35.546 --> 58:36.945
- It's never about
a thing being over,

58:36.947 --> 58:39.014
it's about how you live with it.

58:53.897 --> 58:55.364
- I gotta fix this.

58:58.001 --> 58:59.334
I've gone about this all wrong.

59:01.804 --> 59:03.639
(knocking)

59:03.641 --> 59:06.642
- [Voiceover] LAPD, open up.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.445
- Get the fuck outta there.

59:10.447 --> 59:11.280
- We're not done yet.

59:11.282 --> 59:12.414
- Shut the fuck up!

59:12.416 --> 59:13.782
Get out of the hole.

59:13.784 --> 59:15.050
Drop it, drop it.

59:15.052 --> 59:16.752
- [Voiceover] LAPD, open up.

59:16.754 --> 59:17.419
- Stay by me.

59:17.421 --> 59:18.554
Stay, no, no.

59:18.556 --> 59:19.922
All right, you
two start walking.

59:19.924 --> 59:21.657
Turn off, Viggs, get that light.

59:21.659 --> 59:22.958
Go, go!

59:26.062 --> 59:27.596
Go, go, go!

59:28.698 --> 59:29.898
Shut the fuck up.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.934
Cut her loose and
get it done quick.

59:31.936 --> 59:35.837
Clean yourselves up.

59:39.976 --> 59:42.110
I'm good, I need to trust you.

59:43.446 --> 59:44.746
(knocking)

59:44.748 --> 59:46.915
- [Voiceover] LAPD, open up!

59:48.851 --> 59:52.754
- Oh, come on.

59:57.193 --> 59:58.794
(knocking)

59:58.796 --> 01:00:01.263
- [Voiceover] LAPD, open up now!

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.035
- Evening, hi.

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:08.303
- The owner here?

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:10.906
- That's me.

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:13.075
- You mind if we come inside?

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:15.243
- I guess, yeah.

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:21.350
- Okay.

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.789
- We received a noise complaint.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:28.924
- Yeah, we were just--

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:31.660
- We were having a party.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:34.429
Everyone's gone
though, so it's over.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.032
- Someone thought
they heard a gunshot.

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:38.266
- [Viggs] Oh yeah, the neighbor,

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.836
we were watching
this action flick.

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:43.572
The TV was kind of loud, so,

01:00:43.574 --> 01:00:46.341
thought maybe that was it.

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:47.976
- You okay, ma'am?

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:50.879
- Yeah, things got a little
rough tonight, but we're okay.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:53.115
You know, marriage,
it's, takes work.

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:57.486
- You mind if we
take a look around?

01:00:57.488 --> 01:00:58.954
- Go right ahead.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.472
- Quiet.

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:55.110
- How's your night?

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:00.348
- Your tenants, they here?

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.850
- No.

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.923
- What's up there?

01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:17.666
- Not much.

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:22.804
- [Voiceover] Lennox.

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:24.339
- Lennox here.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:26.908
- [Voiceover] 11-83 at PCH and
Morning View, two-car pileup.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.276
Possible fatalities.

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:30.412
- Copy, we're on our way.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.250
Let's go.

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:38.920
Ma'am?

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.322
Try and keep it down.

01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:42.924
Neighbors get a little
jumpy this time of night.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.559
You two have a good evening.

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:45.494
- You too.

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:46.895
- You too, Officer.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.068
- Change of plans.

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.549
All right, wake the fuck up.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.430
Stand by the fuckin' door.

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:03.798
Don't talk to them.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.301
- What're you gonna do to her?

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:07.769
- That's none of your concern.

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:09.404
- It sure as shit is.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:11.339
- The less you know, the
better off you'll be.

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.774
Might keep you out of jail.

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:14.409
That's for you.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:17.812
You can keep it this time.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.285
- You're gonna do
it, aren't you.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:24.819
- It's my decision.

01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:26.021
It's my burden.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:28.089
By the way, I'm
borrowing your car,

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.791
I'm sure you won't mind.

01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:31.393
Come on.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:36.965
- Son of a bitch.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:39.100
Motherfucker. -
Wait, wait, I got it, I got it.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:39.901
- Oh, you got it?

01:05:39.903 --> 01:05:40.969
- Hurry up!

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.601
Seriously?

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:15.637
- Now's not the time, all right?

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.576
- Please hurry.

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:29.484
Is he gone?

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.390
- Get the fuck outta my house!

01:06:35.392 --> 01:06:36.791
- All right, chill, we're going.

01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:37.659
- Get out now!

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.728
- Get your shit.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.964
- Get out of my house.

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:18.833
Get out of my house
right now, please.

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:20.402
- You know what, Stacey?

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:22.370
You're gonna be a lonely
fucking girl, you know that?

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.705
- I don't wanna hear it anymore.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:24.873
- Yeah, right.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.474
- Little faster,
honey, thank you.

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:28.543
I'm sorry I can't help you.

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:31.012
- Good boy.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:33.381
Oh, can't wait to get out
of this fuckin' place.

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.617
Get in the back.

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:46.194
Good boy.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:48.063
You ready to go?

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:13.855
- All right, let's go.

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:15.323
You need to see this.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:34.943
(somber music)

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.554
You never really
know anyone, do you?

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.258
Friends?

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:01.262
Gimme a break.

01:10:01.264 --> 01:10:04.832
Nothing counts until
that shit hits the fan.

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:08.903
And then you know.

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:13.575
Who runs for cover, who
tries to pull you up.

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:21.316
And these people, these friends,

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:28.156
just geniuses at trying to
find ways to stick it to me.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:33.728
And then there's you

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.763
and your brother.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.801
I mean, what the fuck
was I supposed to do?

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.138
What could I do?

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.709
I mean, you try so hard
to do the right thing

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:50.478
your whole life, and
then in one instant,

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.214
one fuckin' instant,

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.685
I'm labeled a killer.

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.090
A goddamned killer.

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:08.196
I'm sorry.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:16.938
You can't forgive me.

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.011
- [Michelle] Pull the fuck over.

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:25.146
We're 100% fucked.

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:29.117
- Look, you know, Josh
takes care of Amber,

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.486
then we have nothing
to worry about.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:34.289
- Right, nothing to worry about.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:35.623
- Yeah, I know.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:38.593
- Hello, we're homeless.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:40.862
Fuckin' homeless because of you.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.163
Oh, my TV show's coming out?

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:43.865
Great, I'm so
excited, so excited.

01:11:43.867 --> 01:11:46.534
I have nowhere to be,
I have nowhere to live.

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:47.335
- Baby, baby.

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.536
- Because, what?

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:50.638
- Listen.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.006
I have a secret.

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.276
We should be all right.

01:11:55.278 --> 01:11:56.177
Okay?

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:58.279
- What is your secret, then?

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.782
Holy shit.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:03.718
Good job.

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:41.489
Hi, sexy.

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.762
Better be hungry, boy.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:55.269
Hey, you gotta do me
a favor, all right?

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:02.677
Oh, I guess it's all
up to Squeaks now.

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:03.745
Huh, buddy?

01:13:03.747 --> 01:13:06.447
(laughing)

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.618
- Well if it ain't
Bonnie and Clyde.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.554
- Man am I happy to see you.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.456
- Get on in here.

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.462
- This should be good.

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.134
- Sit down.

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:32.407
- Okay, buddy, now it's time
to take a shit for Daddy.

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:37.945
- [Michelle] Does it
usually take this long?

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:39.547
- It does.

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.651
Come on, buddy.

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:47.088
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.693
- No hospitals.

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:55.296
- Won't be necessary.

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:58.566
Bullet barely grazed
the periosteum layer.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:03.404
Some antibiotic, little
infection, some stitches,

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.375
but you're one lucky
son of a bitch.

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.980
This is for the infection.

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:15.183
One pill four times a
day until they're gone.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.786
These will keep
you warm and cozy.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:21.756
One pill twice a day, got it?

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:26.127
- I got another
favor to ask you.

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.029
In the car I got some
guns and I want you

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:29.397
to get rid of 'em.

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:31.532
- Consider it done.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:34.535
- Like destroyed, they're hot.

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:36.370
- They usually are.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.975
- You can write a death
certificate, right?

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:45.980
- Yeah, where's the body going?

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.886
- We're gonna need some
help with that too.

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:58.359
- I got a contact
at Forest Lawn.

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:02.230
We'll look after your brother,
but it's gonna cost you.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:06.133
- I'll figure it out.

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:07.935
Thanks again, Doc.

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.906
- Give me those guns.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.245
- Thanks Doc.

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:19.447
I owe you one.

01:15:19.449 --> 01:15:21.415
- Yeah, you do.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.654
- Are we good?

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:32.960
I said are we good?

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:35.496
- Not even close.

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:39.000
- I'm still 20 grand
in the hole with Nestor

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:40.501
and you owe that cowboy up there

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:42.537
a serious chunk of change.

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:45.172
You got any bright ideas?

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:49.610
How about we sell it?

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:51.212
- You fucking kidding?

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:53.314
- I have to deliver this to
my boss' wife's birthday party

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:56.150
in less than three hours.

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.620
That was the whole point
of this fuckin' fiasco.

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.791
- Birthday party?

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.995
- Oh my God, oh fuck.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.399
- Oh my God!

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.868
Oh my God!

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.706
- [Viggs] Fantastic.

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:34.989
- [Viggs] What's up
guys, how you doin'?

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:36.357
- How're you guys?

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:37.191
How ya doin'?

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:38.626
- Hi.

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:40.194
- I got something really,
really close to me here.

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:41.128
- Okay.

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:44.765
- Wanna put it close to me so
I can take a good look at it?

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.601
- Okay, okay. - All
right, let's see.

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:48.869
Woo!

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:50.438
That's nice.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.305
- That's right.

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:52.206
- Yeah, right?

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.041
- That's nice, that's good.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.548
Where'd you say you got this?

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:07.221
(upbeat dance music)

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.026
- You get in a street fight?

01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:13.561
- You don't wanna
know the details.

01:17:13.563 --> 01:17:15.162
I just wanted to make you proud.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:16.764
- I already got that
taken care of, my friend.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:18.599
My darling.

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.602
- Josh, what happened
to your face?

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:23.237
- Oh, it doesn't matter,
he's just clumsy.

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:24.405
You give me a minute?

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:27.008
Come with me, my
friend, come with me.

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:30.444
I like you, I really
do, I like you.

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:33.514
I think you're a good person,
I think you mean well.

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:36.217
The problem is, I
can't trust you.

01:17:36.219 --> 01:17:38.386
You know why?

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.522
Simon from Natalie K.'s
called when you went back

01:17:41.524 --> 01:17:42.923
to the store on Friday.

01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:44.325
- I'll give him one
of the counterfeits

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:46.227
reserved for the red carpet.

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:48.996
I assure you, he won't
know the difference.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.066
- With all these
shenanigans, you expect me

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:56.270
to trust you with a
$750,000 jewel piece?

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.840
- Mind if I check it out?

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.109
- That's a fuckin' hammer.

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.477
- That's a hammer, but you know,

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:05.946
it's how we check if things
are, you know, legit.

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:08.215
- That's how everybody does it?

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:11.385
Well, be my guest.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:15.289
Dude, you're gonna break it!

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:17.224
- Looks like joke's
on you buddy,

01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:18.426
'cause this thing's a Fugazi.

01:18:18.428 --> 01:18:19.260
- Wait, wait.

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.461
- Excuse me?

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:23.030
- Fugazi?

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.565
- You're kidding, right?

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:26.000
- No, there's no
way this is fake.

01:18:26.002 --> 01:18:28.169
- No it's fake.

01:18:28.171 --> 01:18:29.637
I'll buy the jacket
off you though.

01:18:29.639 --> 01:18:31.238
- Hate to say it kid,
but you fired yourself

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.207
when you took the easy way out.

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.844
As far as why I put you
through this whole goose chase,

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:38.913
I had to see if you
were up to snuff.

01:18:38.915 --> 01:18:41.649
the vetting process.

01:18:41.651 --> 01:18:43.551
You didn't pass.

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:45.419
But I hope you
learned something.

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:47.888
I'll see you around.

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:11.112
- [Voiceover] So, I
got played for a fool.

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:15.182
that's all right, I got plans.

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.645
- Hey Josh.

01:19:44.647 --> 01:19:47.214
Not cool pulling that
little stunt of yours.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:49.116
Ruined my Sunday
on account of you.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.418
Who do you think had to
go pick up the necklace?

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.487
Anything to say, fucknuts?

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:55.422
- You know Tiffany, I'm
sure you're gonna make

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.925
someone very happy one day.

01:19:57.927 --> 01:19:59.994
You can keep this.

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:18.179
Find what you're looking for?

01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:21.816
- Definitely.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.022
Got another ride.

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.294
Wanna race?

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:35.663
If you win, we're even.

01:20:35.665 --> 01:20:39.200
- And so it goes.

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:46.307
Life in the entertainment
capital of the world.

01:20:46.309 --> 01:20:48.075
I'm living the dream.

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:50.144
("Balance" - Opus Orange)
