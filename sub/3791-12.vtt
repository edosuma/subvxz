01:26.295 --> 01:29.088
Fuck you doing, Vince?

01:29.173 --> 01:31.507
- I can't sleep.
- Why not?

01:33.010 --> 01:35.094
I think we should
fire Ari.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.433
- What's wrong?
- I had a nightmare.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.727
Was I with another man?

01:42.811 --> 01:45.021
No, Vince was.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.900
I think he's gonna
fire me today.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.907
No, he screwed up good this time, Vince.
There's no denying it.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.367
You had this movie,
a movie that you love,

01:58.452 --> 02:00.077
and he fucked it up.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.913
Put a bullet in him.
Be done with it.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.581
Leave the gun,
take the cannolis.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.249
You're awfully quiet,
Johnny.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.210
I think everyone should
just take a moment,

02:07.294 --> 02:10.338
try my eggs Florentine
and take a deep breath.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.800
You think I should
keep Ari even after this?

02:13.884 --> 02:16.135
I'm not sure
what you should do, bro.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.679
But I do know you don't make
a decision this big on emotion.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.390
And you don't make it
till you know what's next.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.517
What do you mean?

02:22.601 --> 02:24.560
Well, I mean, nobody
appreciates their girlfriend

02:24.645 --> 02:26.938
until they get herpes
from the next broad.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.190
- Know what I'm saying?
- No, I don't.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.400
- Do you know what he's saying?
- Nope.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.070
I'm saying you don't
dump your girlfriend

02:34.154 --> 02:36.364
until you're flirting
with a couple other young hotties.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.075
See what other agents
are out there, hmm?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.369
- It's not a bad idea.
- Yeah, I do have a couple.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.330
Yeah, I'll meet
other agents after I fire Ari.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.833
I like it, Vince.
Icy cold.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.377
You know it.
Give him a call, E.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.379
Oh, yeah, real icy.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.131
Fine, I'll call.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.884
Hi, E.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.469
It's not E, Lloyd.
It's Vince. Hi.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.388
Hi, Vince.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.182
- Is he in?
- I'm not sure. Hold on, let me check.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.310
It's Vince.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.273
This is starting early.
Tell E I'll call him back.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.483
It's not E, Ari.
It's Vince.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.444
Vince?
He called himself?

03:17.281 --> 03:19.156
Jesus Christ,
this is not good.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.992
- Tell him I'm not here.
- Really?

03:21.076 --> 03:23.703
Yeah, first rule as an agent is you
never take an angry client's call

03:23.787 --> 03:25.997
unless you have good news
that will make him smile, all right?

03:26.081 --> 03:29.125
Now go make an excuse, any excuse,
and get Alan Gray on the phone.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.252
- I already called.
- Call him again.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.963
I gotta get Vince's movie back.
Now go, Lloyd, go!

03:35.591 --> 03:37.925
I am so sorry, Vince.
He is not here.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.969
Oh, well...

03:40.053 --> 03:42.388
then when he gets in,
tell him I'd like to have lunch.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.308
He wants to have lunch.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.644
Vince, I've got his schedule.
There's no way he can make lunch.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.522
He has a ginormously important
lunch already planned.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.191
Okay, then tell him
to call me back.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.776
Okay, I will.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.321
Why the fuck did you just tell him I had
a more important lunch?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.323
Do you think that's
gonna put a smile on his face?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.700
- What did you want me to say?
- That I have a huge wart

04:02.784 --> 04:05.578
on my cock that needs removal
would have been better.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.830
Wake the fuck up,
Lloyd.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.460
- That's Alan Gray's assistant.
- What does it say?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.879
It says, "Alan will
see you at 10:30."

04:14.963 --> 04:17.673
It's 10: 10. How the fuck
am I gonna make it to the Valley?

04:17.757 --> 04:20.801
By running, Ari,
by running!

04:22.971 --> 04:25.723
- He had a ginormously huge lunch.
- Is that even a word?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.100
- I don't know.
- Well, whether it is or it isn't

04:28.185 --> 04:31.395
he should be eating breakfast,
lunch and dinner with you.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.231
He should be over here
making the fucking beds.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.859
- Ari doesn't like us anymore.
- "Boutique Ari" loved us.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.152
"Big Agency Ari"
doesn't.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.404
Ari does not appreciate
the little guy.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.031
Have I become
the little guy?

04:42.115 --> 04:45.117
- It's just an expression.
- This is every agency card

04:45.202 --> 04:47.620
any of us have been
handed over the past five years.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.455
You saved 'em all?

04:49.539 --> 04:52.041
Yeah, like there's
something weird about that.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.377
Come on, we each
pick one. Bro.

04:54.461 --> 04:58.089
Fuck it. Ari's a dick.
Let's flirt.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.384
Okay, Rick Zimmerman,
InterTalent.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.302
Didn't they close
in, like, 1990?

05:03.387 --> 05:06.222
Oh, yeah, that was given to me during
my "Midnight Caller" recurring.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.099
Why don't we just
call Terrance?

05:08.183 --> 05:11.143
And have Vince repped
by E's girlfriend's father?

05:11.228 --> 05:13.479
- What if she dumps him?
- It's a good point.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.481
Please.
I'll call the majors.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.483
Make this easy.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.735
Oh, yeah,
I remember her.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.029
Bitch.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.219
23 minutes to the Valley.
I'm like Chuck Yeager.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.055
Uh-huh,
he's waiting.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.307
- Do you need a drink?
- I'm all good.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.400
- Morning, Alan.
- You've got two minutes, Ari.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.778
- Be grateful for that.
- I am, Alan, I am.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.864
So let me guess.
This Ramones project

06:04.948 --> 06:08.034
has been causing some discomfort
between you and your biggest client.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.869
Hemorrhoids cause
discomfort, Alan.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.871
This is more like
open-heart surgery.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.874
Well, maybe you
should take this as a sign, Ari.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.168
I mean, you made your name
in TV packaging anyway.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.211
Maybe talent relations
just isn't your thing.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.213
What the hell you mad
at me for, Alan?

06:21.298 --> 06:23.215
I did everything I could
to get Vince on "A2."

06:23.300 --> 06:25.217
He's a kid.
He made a mistake.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.344
You know he'd kill
as Joey Ramone.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.973
Well, maybe he would,
maybe he wouldn't.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.517
But I do know
that Jake Gyllenhaal definitely will.

06:33.602 --> 06:37.313
I saw some of his camera tests for "A2."
He's brilliant.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.315
You know what my only
regret is, Ari?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.317
That I didn't put Jake
in "A1."

06:41.401 --> 06:44.236
Because I could only imagine it would
have been even bigger.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.073
Alan, that's not really fair, okay?
Vince was great.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.075
Well, thank you, Dana,
but you're here to take notes,

06:49.159 --> 06:51.786
not offer opinions. Since there really
aren't any notes to be taken,

06:51.870 --> 06:55.039
you don't need to be here
at all, do you, hmm?

06:55.123 --> 06:57.541
Come to think of it,
neither do I.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.752
It's two minutes, Ari.
Goodbye.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.338
Hard to believe that

07:02.422 --> 07:05.925
you've been divorced
three times, Alan.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.265
This is weird.
I've never had another agent.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.309
I don't even know
what to look for.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.311
Well, let me be your guide, Vince.
Over the years,

07:17.395 --> 07:19.355
I've developed a foolproof system
for judging the merits

07:19.439 --> 07:22.274
- of a prospective agency.
- I guess you've had a lot of practice,

07:22.359 --> 07:24.026
considering how many times
you've been dropped.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.945
Never officially dropped, Turtle.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.530
Although one did move
without telling me.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.658
- Now what's your system?
- I judge an agency on four categories...

07:30.742 --> 07:34.078
decor, service,
amenities and ambiance.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.122
Give up to 10 points
for each category.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.707
The agency with the highest
overall score wins.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.336
I originally devised it for my visits to
day spas, but it's perfectly applicable.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.964
Yeah, I'm sure there's a direct
correlation between Vince's career

07:45.048 --> 07:47.383
- and your anti-aging regimen.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.177
I give 'em a six for decor.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.388
I mean, what kind
of self-respecting agency

07:52.472 --> 07:54.390
has fake plants
in their lobby?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.684
I don't think they're fake.
There's a girl over there watering them.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.561
Yeah, maybe the water's
fake, huh, Drama?

07:58.645 --> 08:01.730
Hi, Vince. I'm Vanessa,
Gene's assistant.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.941
- I love the decor.
- Hi.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.152
- And you must be Eric, hi.
- How are you?

08:06.236 --> 08:08.279
- I'm Turtle. How you doing?
- Hi.

08:08.363 --> 08:11.907
- And you are?
- Not for sale, honey.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.619
Well, everyone's waiting for you guys
down at the conference room.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.329
If you gentlemen
would like to follow me.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.039
We'll be out soon.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.042
Didn't even offer us a drink.
That's a zero for service.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.044
Yeah, but still,
I'd give 'em a 10 for amenities

08:24.129 --> 08:26.297
if she'll let me
service that ass.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.971
The way we see it,
you're not just an actor, Vince.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.182
You're not just
a movie star.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.851
You, sir, are a brand.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.145
Mercedes...

08:44.608 --> 08:47.902
Coca-Cola, two of the most
recognizable names

08:47.986 --> 08:49.987
on the planet.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.407
Vincent Chase.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.245
We intend to make you
as popular as both of them.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.668
Vince has called
three times, Ari.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.837
That's three times more
than he called all of last year.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.590
I know. He keeps calling me,
too, and I got an e-mail.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.592
I didn't even know
he knew how to do that.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.552
- I have other information.
- Yeah.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.221
It's also regarding Vince.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.140
Speak or I will intern you
like it's 1942.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.351
- I am not Japanese, Ari.
- Speak!

09:20.435 --> 09:23.354
Vince is taking a meeting
with another agency.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.689
- How do you know that?
- The Gay Mafia

09:25.774 --> 09:28.567
has been replaced
by the Gay Assistant Corps, Ari.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.820
We know all.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.990
He'll be at Le Petit Four
at 1:30 meeting with Andy Left.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.202
Jesus, he's gonna humiliate
me in public after all these years.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.746
I know.
It's all so sinister.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.123
- I hate break-ups.
- It ain't over yet.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.417
Call Left's office
and tell him it's Eric.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.419
Ari.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.422
- Oh, it's Hitler's evil twin.
- I need to talk to you.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.758
You know, Dana, the only time I've ever
enjoyed talking to you

09:52.842 --> 09:55.094
- is when your mouth has been full.
- Okay, is that nice?

09:55.178 --> 09:57.513
Ari, I have Left's office.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.140
- Hey, Mr. Murphy.
- Hey, bro, listen, I hate to cancel

10:00.225 --> 10:03.143
on such short notice, but Vince isn't
gonna be able to make lunch.

10:03.228 --> 10:06.563
- Sorry, bro.
- Oh my God. Hold on. Let me get Andy.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.149
You don't need to do that.
Just tell him he's a great big fag.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.235
- All right, see ya.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.823
- That's nice, Ari.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

10:15.907 --> 10:16.991
What's up, Dana?

10:17.075 --> 10:18.742
I'm gonna tell you something,
but you have to swear

10:18.827 --> 10:20.869
- it's not gonna come back to me.
- As always, hand on heart.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.539
- Ari, please.
- I swear.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.374
Alan's not gonna make
this movie.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.376
He bought it just
to spite Vince,

10:27.460 --> 10:29.461
and he's gonna stick it
in a drawer.

10:29.546 --> 10:33.424
- Jesus, he really is crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.468
- Why you telling me this?
- Because I hate working for him,

10:36.553 --> 10:38.971
and I want out.
And, Ari, come on.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.016
I mean, I love this movie.
I grew up on the Ramones,

10:42.100 --> 10:45.519
and I love it for Vince, so get me
on as a producer.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.688
Sure, how?

10:47.772 --> 10:50.899
- It's Alan's movie.
- No, not yet it isn't.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.235
They're still negotiating
Bob's perk package.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.030
So just make sure
he doesn't sign those papers.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.371
Dana, I have never
cheated on my wife,

11:04.456 --> 11:06.040
not since she became
my wife,

11:06.124 --> 11:07.916
but if you want to jerk me in the car
right now, I'm game.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.294
Rain check, Ari.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.759
Was a little corporate, huh?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.302
Yeah, I felt like I was
in Trump's boardroom.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.012
Well, an overall score
of 22.5

11:20.096 --> 11:22.014
doesn't bode well
for them anyway.

11:22.098 --> 11:25.392
Yeah, but still, if that assistant calls
me back, maybe we should go with 'em.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.227
Hasn't Vince gotten you
laid enough, Turtle?

11:27.312 --> 11:29.229
Well, that depends.
What's your definition of enough?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.398
- Come on, the search continues.
- Hi, how are you?

11:31.483 --> 11:33.067
We're here to meet
Andy Left for lunch.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.362
Andy Left canceled his
reservation over an hour ago.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.739
- Are you sure?
- That's what it says, yeah.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.033
The guy doesn't even bother
to call you?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.827
I'd say that's a substantial point loss
in the service area.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.539
Forget about points, Turtle.
That earns Left a bitch-slap.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.666
Take it easy, Drama.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.755
- Andy Left's office.
- Hey, Lamar, right?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.216
It's Eric Murphy.
I'm standing outside Le Petit Four

11:57.300 --> 11:59.676
with Vincent Chase.
They said that Andy canceled lunch.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.805
- You canceled lunch, Eric.
- I didn't cancel anything, Lamar.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.350
Uh-huh, and I suppose that you didn't
call Andy a big fag, either.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.852
- What?
- Andy would have shed blood,

12:08.937 --> 12:11.897
sweat and tears for Vince,
but he has his principles.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.278
Somebody fucked with us,
canceled our lunch,

12:18.363 --> 12:20.072
said I called Andy
a big fag.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.657
- Ari.
- Definitely!

12:21.741 --> 12:23.909
- He's cockblocking, Vin.
- Yeah, but how did he know?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.954
Because he's Ari,
and he's a dirty sweaty scumbag,

12:27.038 --> 12:29.373
- but he's good.
- Ari, it's E.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.584
You need to call us
back now. No answer.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.753
- Oh, he's definitely avoiding us.
- Definitely.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.798
It's the right move, like when I wanted
to dump Rhona Davies.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.925
She knew about it,
and moved to Australia.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.636
I had to wait two whole years to tell
her we were through.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.513
Fuck it, what's next?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.640
- We got Josh Weinstein at 3:00.
- Really?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.851
How do you think Ari's
gonna take that one?

12:48.935 --> 12:51.228
Josh Weinstein?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.230
Are you fucking
kidding me?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.149
I'm not, and I tried
your little lunch cancelation trick,

12:55.233 --> 12:58.068
- but he was onto it somehow.
- Josh fucking Weinstein!

12:58.153 --> 13:01.196
I don't believe it.
I'd rather Vince fuck my wife.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.698
No, Ari, no!

13:02.782 --> 13:06.118
Just keep
me informed, Lloyd.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.829
Open up
the goddamn door, Bob!

13:08.913 --> 13:12.458
Go away, Ari, or I'm calling my
security company.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.501
And they're all
ex-Navy SEALs.

13:14.586 --> 13:18.547
Bob, stop.
I come bearing gifts.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.801
I don't want gifts.
I want quiet.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.554
Bob, you've known me
20 years, all right? Let me in.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.639
What kind of gifts
do you have?

13:29.058 --> 13:30.642
My car.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.936
750i BMW,

13:33.021 --> 13:35.564
3,300 miles,
built-in iPod dock.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.609
Oak dash.
It's beautiful.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.361
- You own it, or you lease it?
- I lease it,

13:41.446 --> 13:43.655
but I will continue to make
the payments until it expires,

13:43.740 --> 13:45.407
unless you expire first.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.787
You're desperate, huh?

13:50.872 --> 13:53.081
Bob, I will strip down naked
and breakdance through Beverly Hills

13:53.166 --> 13:55.709
if it will get you not to sign that
deal with Alan.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.836
I don't want your junk.
All I want to do is make the movie.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.755
- That's all I ever wanted.
- Bob...

13:59.839 --> 14:02.633
Alan's not going to make that movie
with you, never ever.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.426
Oh, that's complete
bullshit.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.137
No, it's not. It's the truth.
You gotta trust me.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.681
Trust you... oh, ho.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.683
Why the hell
should I trust you?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.895
Because I spoke to someone, Bob,
someone who knows.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.523
- Who?
- Doesn't matter who. What matters is

14:17.607 --> 14:20.526
- it's the truth.
- That's not good enough. I need proof.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.612
I can't
reveal my sources.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.366
- I promised I wouldn't talk.
- Go home, Ari.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.369
Dana Gordon,

14:30.453 --> 14:32.579
V.P. Of production
with Alan.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.791
I used to fuck her back in the day,
so she owes me.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.922
Ah.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.217
- Like the fish.
- Like the artwork.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.178
Ooh, I like her
and her and her.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.472
Looks like about 40 points
to me, huh, Johnny?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.349
Slow down, Vince.
We haven't seen the underbelly yet.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.560
- There's an underbelly?
- Don't be ignorant, E.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.604
- There's always an underbelly.
- Vince, E.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.856
I knew someday our paths
would cross again.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.401
- Good to see you, Josh.
- Great to see you, Vince.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.862
And you, Johnny, are you looking
for representation as well?

15:05.947 --> 15:09.074
Heard about the Ed Burns pilot.
It's a great script.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.493
Today, I wanna focus on Vince,
but you call me tomorrow if you have

15:11.578 --> 15:12.869
any needs that
aren't being met.

15:12.954 --> 15:16.623
May, get these guys
some drinks.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.376
Oh, and, Turtle,
all my assistants love to fuck.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.754
I ask 'em when they interview.
True story.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.215
Come on in, guys.
The whole team's waiting.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.135
- We're so excited.
- I love it here.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.345
Underbelly, Turtle.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.806
Underbelly.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.607
- You feeling this?
- Definitely.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.072
Apple...

15:49.157 --> 15:51.908
Canon...

15:51.993 --> 15:54.286
Vincent Chase.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.671
Are you happy, Ari?
Or is this madness that will turn on me

16:04.756 --> 16:06.673
- on a moment's notice?
- This is happiness, Lloyd.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.217
This is pure heterosexual
male happiness.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.554
- So Bob was receptive?
- Bob was lucid.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.140
Bob was coherent.
Bob was amiable.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.184
Bob could come
to no other conclusion

16:17.268 --> 16:19.353
than to return this film
to its rightful owner...

16:19.437 --> 16:21.480
Vincent Chase.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.231
I like when
you're happy, Ari.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.317
You know, Vince was
my first discovery.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.319
I built other stars' careers,
but he was mine.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.654
I saw him
in this commercial,

16:28.738 --> 16:31.323
and I said, "This kid
has got something," and I was right.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.033
He's more than
a client, Lloyd.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.035
He's like my baby.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.329
I love Vince, Lloyd.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.668
Ari Gold's office.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.420
- It's Dana Gordon.
- And I love Dana Gordon, too.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.591
I love you,
Dana Gordon.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.636
You swore you would keep your mouth
shut, you slimy piece of shit.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.596
Dana...

16:54.681 --> 16:56.848
Even though I know
what a lowlife you are...

16:56.933 --> 16:58.642
I always trusted you.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.603
- Ditto, Dana, ditto.
- But you fucked me.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.190
I was desperate, Dana.

17:05.273 --> 17:08.276
Ari, you have one day
to find me another job,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.404
or the next time I see you at The Palm,
I'm going to squeeze

17:10.488 --> 17:13.240
your fucking dick
with a claw cracker, all right?

17:13.324 --> 17:15.242
Miss Gordon, I'm afraid
your five minutes are up.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.202
- It's time to go.
- Fuck you!

17:17.286 --> 17:20.204
Put one hand on me,
and I scream rape.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.541
This is a classic example
of not judging a book by its cover.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.377
- That place was all surface.
- You were right, Drama.

17:26.462 --> 17:30.006
All surface. I don't believe any
of those assistants love to fuck.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.717
You couldn't even get
a number, huh, Turtle?

17:31.801 --> 17:33.385
- Not a one.
- This is depressing.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.928
Maybe we just go
without an agent.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.597
Drama did that for 10 years.
Really worked for him.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.307
Suck it, Turtle.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.393
Did you sign
those papers, Bob?

17:41.477 --> 17:44.521
You know, you got that
poor girl fired, Ari.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.315
- Did you sign them?
- I-I felt terrible

17:47.400 --> 17:49.526
about calling Alan,
but this is my baby,

17:49.610 --> 17:52.112
- and she was messing with my baby.
- Bob!

17:53.489 --> 17:56.241
I made a 50-year career,
a half-century career

17:56.325 --> 17:58.034
trusting my instincts,
Ari.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.120
And what the fuck
did your instincts tell you, Bob?

18:00.204 --> 18:02.914
They told me it's a different world
out there today.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.584
Different players.
Different ethics.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.961
Different bullshit.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.589
It's a lot less fun,
and I don't like it.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.257
Bob!

18:12.341 --> 18:15.385
I signed the papers,
Ari.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.305
I don't know
if I was right,

18:18.389 --> 18:20.557
but I signed
the damn papers.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.520
I'm over this town.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.314
I'm sorry.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.403
Yeah, me too, Bob.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.071
Me too.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.916
I don't have anything
good to tell Vince.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.627
Just get him on the phone.
Let me take what's coming.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.840
How is it to take it
in the ass anyway, Lloyd?

18:53.925 --> 18:55.759
I don't know, Ari.
I'm on top.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.719
Come on, really?

18:58.805 --> 19:01.765
Anyway, make the call.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.684
- No.
- No what?

19:06.562 --> 19:07.771
No, I will
not call.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.439
Oh, fuck, this is not
gonna be another one

19:09.524 --> 19:11.483
of your "Queer As Folk"
pep talks, is it, Lloyd?

19:11.567 --> 19:14.069
Yes, Ari, yes, it is.
And it's gonna be a good one.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.198
Look, you said first
rule of an agent is not to call a client

19:18.282 --> 19:20.909
till you have good news.
Well, you have no good news.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.246
But I have news for you, Ari Gold.
Yes, you screwed up.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.082
Yes, you were devious.
Yes, you were conniving.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.376
But, yes, you care.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.878
I know that even
when you throw

19:31.963 --> 19:34.381
the most hurtful
homophobic slurs my way,

19:34.465 --> 19:36.383
that you really do care.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.385
Vince knows that.
Just remind him.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.765
You're right, Lloyd.
Look at this place.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.476
75,000 square feet
all built

19:46.561 --> 19:48.186
on my giving a fuck.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.188
Make the call.
Tell every agent

19:50.273 --> 19:52.524
in this building
to get prepared.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.318
- For what?
- For battle, Lloyd.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.362
For battle.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.743
- Ari.
- Finally. Stay strong, Vin.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.079
Hey.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.458
Hey.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.378
So we should talk.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.339
Yeah, Ari, we should, but you're a tough
man to get on the phone.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.049
We should talk
in person.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.844
- All right, I'll drop in.
- When can you be here?

20:20.928 --> 20:24.681
- 20 minutes.
- See you then.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.730
He's coming.
I'm actually nervous.

20:31.814 --> 20:35.066
- That's cute, Ari.
- Get out of my office, Lloyd.

20:38.112 --> 20:41.281
- Should have just done it on the phone.
- It's the right thing to do.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.950
Look him in the eye, let him know
exactly why this is happening.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.995
Fuck that.
Avoid all contact, Vin.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.788
Let him wonder
for the rest of his life.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.124
Courtney DeMayo ditched me on
the phone in the first grade,

20:51.208 --> 20:54.753
and I'm still wondering and hurting.
The phone break-up is so cruel.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.339
Looking Ari in the eyes
is not gonna be easy.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.591
Yeah, and you know
he's gonna beg.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.302
I mean, it's so
fucking weird.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.721
This is gonna be the last time
we drive to Ari's.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.724
- Yep.
- Don't do it.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.684
What?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.311
I think it's
a mistake.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.606
You saw what all those
cookie-cutter guys were like today.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.608
They're all the same.
An agent by nature

21:16.692 --> 21:18.610
is a lying, money-hungry
cocksucker.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.446
That's the breed,
and Ari is best in breed.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.532
How do we know that, Drama?
We've never been with anybody else.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.160
I have. I've had 15 different agents
over the years,

21:27.244 --> 21:29.955
and only that few,
'cause I'm a loyal guy.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.581
Sounds like you don't want
to get dropped

21:31.666 --> 21:33.124
from another agency
when Vince moves on.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.126
Please, Turtle,
if my pilot gets picked up,

21:35.211 --> 21:37.504
I could sign with anyone I want,
and you know what?

21:37.588 --> 21:41.091
I'd stay with Ari. 'Cause we know
where we stand with him.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.176
- He was there from the beginning.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.598
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking he's right.

21:48.683 --> 21:51.685
I mean, Ari's been good to us.
He's not like all those other guys.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.229
We know him.
He's our friend.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.773
But he did
fuck us on this.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.318
And as our friend,
he should say he's sorry.

22:00.403 --> 22:04.030
Maybe he will, Vince.
Maybe he will.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.296
- What's up, Lloyd?
- Mr. Chase.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.674
- Mr. Chase?
- Ari wants me to do that today.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.176
Now let's head in. They're waiting
for you in the conference room.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.511
They?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.513
We'll be out here enjoying
the perfect-10 amenities.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.515
You know, even Lloyd's
starting to grow on me.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.517
Oh, you think
Lloyd's cute, Drama?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.644
You know what
I mean, asshole.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.192
Gentlemen, welcome.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.611
- What is this, Ari?
- Yeah, Ari.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.573
I thought this was supposed to be more
of a face to face thing.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.492
It is, Vinnie, it is.
It's you face-to-face

22:49.577 --> 22:52.328
with the face
of this entire agency.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.457
Gentlemen,
please sit down.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.626
Right now, Vince,
phones here are ringing off the hook,

22:58.711 --> 23:00.879
and clients are wondering
where their agents are.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.465
- And you know where they are?
- Yeah, they're in here.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.467
Exactly, and you
wanna know why?

23:05.551 --> 23:07.469
It's because we are
100% committed

23:07.553 --> 23:09.763
to giving Vincent Chase
all that he needs.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.974
Vinnie, you do not need to hear
about the past today.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.727
I'm not gonna bore you
with the details of the past five years

23:15.811 --> 23:17.645
and all that we've
done together.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.606
I don't even need
to talk about the fact that I found you

23:19.690 --> 23:21.608
and brought you
from obscurity to superstardom.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.401
Yeah, good thing he
didn't mention that.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.695
- Yeah, really.
- What you see before you, Vince,

23:25.780 --> 23:27.614
is a full-service agency:

23:27.698 --> 23:31.534
TV division,
music division, reality division.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.162
God forbid, Johnny Drama's
pilot does not go,

23:34.246 --> 23:37.332
boom, he's on "The Surreal Life,"
one phone call.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.210
We wanna make you
bigger than movies, Vince.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.797
We wanna take you
international.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.260
Microsoft, McDonald's,

23:49.345 --> 23:51.554
Vincent Chase.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.057
Brand-name recognition.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.352
What do you think?

23:57.436 --> 24:00.396
I think I need
to think.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.857
Vince.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.859
It's pathetic, Ari.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.407
Vince, what are
you doing?

24:11.492 --> 24:14.035
Ari, I didn't need
the whole dog and pony show.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.246
I really thought you were different
from everyone else.

24:16.330 --> 24:19.415
- Vince, I am.
- Ari, you do things your own way

24:19.500 --> 24:21.417
and you don't give
a shit what we think about it.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.795
I do give a shit.
You should have seen me today,

24:23.879 --> 24:26.089
begging and pleading,
trying to get you that movie back.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.926
But it's gone. The past is the past.
Let's look to the future.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.595
You're unreal. I mean, even after
you fuck up like this,

24:32.680 --> 24:35.974
you can't even muster
the strength to just, as my friend,

24:36.058 --> 24:38.476
look me in the face
and say "I'm sorry."

24:38.561 --> 24:41.020
- That's all you wanted?
- That's all I wanted.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.439
Then I'm sorry, Vin.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.525
It's too late.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.569
- Vince.
- Ari.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.196
- You're fired.
- Let's roll.
