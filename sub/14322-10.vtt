00:01.708 --> 00:03.083
[theme music playing]

00:30.625 --> 00:31.750
[dramatic music with drums]

00:59.458 --> 01:00.750
There!

01:05.875 --> 01:06.958
[buzzing]

01:10.708 --> 01:12.250
-[boom]
-Argh!

01:17.375 --> 01:18.500
[crash]

01:25.458 --> 01:29.166
What are you doing?
We need the boy alive!

01:52.458 --> 01:53.625
[grunts]

01:53.625 --> 01:54.750
[crash]

02:06.458 --> 02:08.958
Hurry! We can't let him
get away!

02:11.375 --> 02:14.833
My honored Lord,
I have disturbing news.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.708
Your less worthy servants
have allowed

02:16.708 --> 02:19.708
the vessel of your glorious
return to escape.

02:19.708 --> 02:21.458
How could you?

02:21.458 --> 02:22.833
The hounds have
surely recovered

02:22.833 --> 02:24.583
the mutant by now, my Lord.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.333
The boy will be placed
upon the altar

02:26.333 --> 02:28.958
the time of the conjunction,
I assure it!

02:28.958 --> 02:32.583
I have drifted too long
in this suffocating void,

02:32.583 --> 02:36.583
waiting for
the celestial alignment
that could free me.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.000
I shall not miss it!

02:39.000 --> 02:41.500
I understand, my Lord.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.875
The world aches
for your return.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.708
Serve me well, Cortez,

02:47.708 --> 02:52.166
and I shall make you the most
powerful mutant on Earth.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.000
Yes, my Lord.

02:54.166 --> 02:59.083
And, Cortez,
do not disappoint me again.

03:02.625 --> 03:06.416
Hear me, for I bring you
the word of the master!

03:06.500 --> 03:10.875
Your fathers and your fathers'
fathers have honored him,

03:10.875 --> 03:13.125
made sacrifice unto him

03:13.125 --> 03:15.750
and preserved
his temple of rest

03:15.750 --> 03:18.750
for the time when he should
once again walk among men.

03:18.750 --> 03:21.750
That time is almost upon us.

03:22.625 --> 03:28.458
The very Earth shall tremble
at the footsteps of Apocalypse!

03:28.458 --> 03:31.958
[all chanting] Apocalypse!
Apocalypse...

03:33.458 --> 03:36.000
[Jubilee speaking Spanish]

03:39.291 --> 03:40.958
You should have
come in, Hank.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.583
The store owner guy
was so nice.

03:43.583 --> 03:47.208
Perhaps. Though here,
as elsewhere on our journey,

03:47.208 --> 03:48.875
your more conventional
appearance

03:48.875 --> 03:50.750
has proved less alarming.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.208
Yeah, maybe.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.583
And anyway, I got something
for you.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.750
I know it's kind of cheesy,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.458
but I really do want
to thank you for bringing me.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.500
Your company and thoughtfulness
have been quite welcome.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.083
But this Andean dig
will be our last.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.458
Though the world's
great wildernesses

04:07.458 --> 04:08.875
have proved fertile ground

04:08.875 --> 04:10.583
for my archaeological research,

04:10.583 --> 04:13.375
I find now
that I yearn for home.

04:13.375 --> 04:17.000
Ooh. Yeah.
Traffic, smog, mutant haters?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.250
Can't wait to get back
to all that.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.000
True, civilization
has its drawbacks,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.250
but nature
has its own dark side,

04:24.250 --> 04:26.875
brutal, merciless
and mysterious.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.583
Kind of like Wolverine
before he's had his coffee.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.458
[bangs door open]

04:36.000 --> 04:39.583
Master, we could not recover
the boy.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.083
Leave us.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.708
You worthless fool!

04:48.708 --> 04:51.375
Do you realize what your
incompetence will cost?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.291
It wasn't our fault.

04:53.416 --> 04:57.125
-Return!
-Please, no!

04:57.250 --> 05:00.291
I drag you out
of the Morlock sewers,

05:00.291 --> 05:04.458
I give you power
beyond your feeble imagination

05:04.458 --> 05:07.958
and you repay me
with incompetence?

05:07.958 --> 05:11.166
I should have left you
as I found you,

05:11.166 --> 05:15.125
pathetic, despised and weak.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.875
Find the boy,
or another young mutant

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
powerful enough
to serve as host

05:20.000 --> 05:22.708
to our Lord Apocalypse
at the appointed moment,

05:22.875 --> 05:26.625
or I will see you
fed to the hounds!

05:27.750 --> 05:30.583
[stammering] Yes, my Lord!

05:38.458 --> 05:41.708
Uh... Hank, do you see
any bridges on that map?

05:41.833 --> 05:44.833
No, I'm afraid we are
in terra incognita.

05:44.958 --> 05:47.833
To my knowledge, there are
no accurate maps of this--

05:47.833 --> 05:49.750
-[screams]
-[tires screeching]

05:50.333 --> 05:53.458
[Beast] Oh, my! It appears
we have run out of road.

05:55.958 --> 05:58.291
Nah, we ran out of road
hours ago.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.166
Now we're out of ground!

06:00.291 --> 06:02.875
Well, no way across.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.375
Guess we might as well
head back

06:04.375 --> 06:05.875
to that cool little store,
right?

06:06.333 --> 06:08.500
Actually, a local tribe

06:08.500 --> 06:10.458
seems to have provided
for our crossing.

06:11.708 --> 06:13.500
Thank you, local tribe.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.250
[Beast] It seems safe.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.166
The stone moorings
are centuries old,

06:19.291 --> 06:21.333
but the ropes are contemporary.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.583
People live here?

06:22.708 --> 06:24.500
So it would seem.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.166
Let us get the packs
out of the truck.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.333
We will have to go
the rest of the way on foot.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.458
Just what I was
looking forward to,

06:30.458 --> 06:33.333
a little hike at 12,000 feet.

06:33.708 --> 06:36.458
[Jubilee echoing] Just what
I was looking forward to,

06:36.458 --> 06:39.875
a little hike at 12,000 feet.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.000
A mutant!

06:42.083 --> 06:46.291
Young, and with great power!

06:47.125 --> 06:50.458
Hounds, come!
We have found a new vessel!

06:56.375 --> 06:59.208
Archaeologically,
this makes no sense.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.375
This stelae is centuries old

07:01.375 --> 07:03.708
and the pictographs
appear to be Mayan,

07:03.708 --> 07:05.291
from the classical period.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.000
But unless we have hiked
3,000 miles north,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I do not see
how that's possible.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.125
What about the temples
at Machu Picchu?

07:12.125 --> 07:13.625
No, they're Incan.

07:13.625 --> 07:16.000
This is definitely
northern Mayan.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.333
My Yucatecan is
barely serviceable,

07:18.333 --> 07:20.875
but this is a road sign
of sorts.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.583
It says that

07:22.583 --> 07:26.500
"A few miles ahead is a temple

07:26.500 --> 07:30.875
"consecrated to the end
of the world"?

07:30.875 --> 07:34.416
That's a pretty weird thing
to build a temple to.

07:34.416 --> 07:39.000
Uh... Didn't the Mayans have,
like, human sacrifices?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.458
In fact, Mayan civilization
enjoyed

07:41.458 --> 07:44.000
elaborate systems
of writing and mathematics,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.583
and one of the first
accurate calendars.

07:46.708 --> 07:48.833
Scholars believe they may have
even developed

07:48.833 --> 07:51.000
the crucial concept of zero.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.708
What a concept.

07:52.708 --> 07:56.291
But what were they doing
3,000 miles from home?

07:56.416 --> 07:57.625
Wait a minute.

07:58.250 --> 08:01.416
It seems I made
a slight mistake
in my translation.

08:01.416 --> 08:04.583
The temple is not consecrated
to the end of the world,

08:04.583 --> 08:07.083
it is "consecrated
to Apocalypse."

08:08.708 --> 08:10.166
-[boom]
-[both scream]

08:11.166 --> 08:13.208
Surrender the female child!

08:14.416 --> 08:16.833
Are you talking to me?

08:16.833 --> 08:18.000
Not now, Jubilee.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.875
I believe we made a wrong turn.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.583
Our humblest apologies
for our thoughtless intrusion.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.000
Get them!

08:27.000 --> 08:27.875
[thud]

08:29.875 --> 08:32.416
"The better part of valor
is discretion."

08:32.416 --> 08:33.500
That means run, right?

08:33.500 --> 08:35.416
In so many words.

08:39.958 --> 08:41.125

09:03.250 --> 09:04.500
Jubilee?

09:04.625 --> 09:06.750
[Blade] Caliban!

09:06.750 --> 09:08.875
Stop! Stop the vessel!

09:08.875 --> 09:10.250
Caliban?

09:11.125 --> 09:12.875
No!

09:14.166 --> 09:16.125
[screaming]

09:16.500 --> 09:19.583
-Fool! What are you doing?
-Well...

09:19.583 --> 09:23.583
This sure is
a learning experience.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.458
Don't move!

09:26.458 --> 09:29.708
Fine. My appointment book
is wide open.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.333
[grunting]

09:36.166 --> 09:38.500
[Caliban] Jubilee!

09:39.125 --> 09:41.458
-No!
-[Jubilee screaming]

09:43.083 --> 09:45.583
-[Jubilee screaming]
-Hold on.

09:45.583 --> 09:46.583
[grunts]

09:47.458 --> 09:49.958
I won't let anything
happen to you.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.375
It is good
you saved the vessel.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.750
Now perhaps Cortez
will let you live.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.333
I'm sorry you came here.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.125
[Whip] On your knees!

10:18.708 --> 10:21.708
What spooky jungle movie
did we step into?

10:21.833 --> 10:23.458
[Beast] I would venture to
guess they have been

10:23.458 --> 10:25.708
worshiping Apocalypse
for centuries.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.875
This place appears to be
a duplicate Lazarus Temple,

10:28.875 --> 10:31.208
similar to the one Cable
destroyed in Egypt.

10:34.875 --> 10:38.208
-[Beast] Fabian Cortez?
-Dr. Henry McCoy!

10:38.208 --> 10:40.750
How flattering that you
remember me.

10:40.750 --> 10:41.708
But how...

10:41.708 --> 10:44.083
How is it that I am here

10:44.083 --> 10:46.208
when you thought I had perished
on Asteroid M?

10:46.208 --> 10:47.750
It's very simple.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.625
I was saved
for a higher purpose.

10:51.750 --> 10:55.291
I am the chosen one

10:55.291 --> 10:59.000
charged by the almighty
Apocalypse himself

10:59.000 --> 11:01.708
to help him return to Earth.

11:01.708 --> 11:04.125
But Apocalypse was destroyed.

11:04.125 --> 11:08.083
Apocalypse cannot not exist.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.708
He is now without
a physical body,

11:09.708 --> 11:11.833
trapped in a pitiless void,

11:11.833 --> 11:14.458
but his essence lives.

11:14.458 --> 11:18.458
That is why I was chosen

11:18.458 --> 11:22.291
to prepare the way
for his return.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.125
Before he was taken,

11:24.125 --> 11:27.208
Apocalypse sent me
to wander the Earth,

11:27.208 --> 11:30.958
to create the hounds
as his personal soldiers.

11:31.083 --> 11:34.458
Then he led me
to this forgotten place,

11:34.458 --> 11:37.250
a failsafe built eons ago,

11:37.375 --> 11:41.250
a final insurance
should all other plans fail.

11:41.250 --> 11:45.291
This temple of Apocalypse
is the portal

11:45.291 --> 11:50.208
through which he shall return
to our world, his world.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.833
Cortez, your quarrel
is with me.

11:52.958 --> 11:55.250
Please,
release my young charge.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.583
The child will not be harmed.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.375
What is it
with this "child" thing?

12:00.375 --> 12:02.750
Apocalypse will only betray you

12:02.750 --> 12:04.625
as he has done
to countless others.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.833
[laughing]

12:07.416 --> 12:09.333
Betray me?

12:09.333 --> 12:11.833
He has empowered me!

12:11.833 --> 12:14.250
[screaming in pain]

12:15.625 --> 12:19.250
I've never tested its limits
until now.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.333
-[yelling]
-You're destroying him!

12:21.333 --> 12:23.458
If the good doctor survives,

12:23.458 --> 12:26.000
he shall serve Apocalypse
as a hound.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.625
If not, there will be one less
traitor to mutantkind.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.291
[roaring]

12:32.708 --> 12:33.958
Hank!

[grunting]

12:44.208 --> 12:45.458
[people screaming]

12:45.458 --> 12:47.166
[Cortez] Forget about him!

12:47.166 --> 12:50.083
The celestial conjunction
is nearly upon us.

12:50.083 --> 12:53.375
We must make ready
for the coming of Apocalypse.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.958
Take our honored guest below

12:55.958 --> 12:58.458
and prepare her
for the ceremony.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.583
Oh, Hank!

13:02.250 --> 13:05.000
[Cortez] My Lord,
all is in readiness.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.083
What of the vessel?

13:07.083 --> 13:09.875
She is being prepared
as we speak.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.291
You serve me well,
Fabian Cortez.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.208
Thank you, my Lord.

13:17.208 --> 13:21.000
You dare sully my communion
with Lord Apocalypse?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.458
Explain yourself!

13:22.583 --> 13:24.000
I'm sorry.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.750
Caliban would like to look

13:25.750 --> 13:27.625
for another vessel.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.458
Fool! [thwack]

13:29.458 --> 13:32.708
Is this sympathy I hear?

13:32.708 --> 13:34.125
For an X-Man?

13:34.125 --> 13:36.458
Nothing must endanger

13:36.458 --> 13:38.166
our master's return.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.708
She will be sacrificed!

13:41.250 --> 13:43.125

[grunting]

15:02.208 --> 15:06.125
The time of the crossing
is upon us.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.208
Bring forth the vessel

15:08.208 --> 15:11.000
and place her upon the altar.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.250
[Jubilee grunting]
Let go of me!

15:14.583 --> 15:17.375
The faithful will be rewarded

15:17.375 --> 15:20.333
when our Lord Apocalypse
returns.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.583
The Earth will be cleansed of

15:23.583 --> 15:26.125
infidels and the weak!

15:26.250 --> 15:30.375
Caliban, you don't have
to do this. Help me!

15:30.875 --> 15:33.458
You think she cares
about a freak like you?

15:33.583 --> 15:37.708
Yes. Take me instead, please!

15:37.708 --> 15:41.000
You? A Morlock as the vessel

15:41.000 --> 15:43.208
for our Lord Apocalypse?

15:43.333 --> 15:44.958
[laughing]

You disgust me!

16:16.458 --> 16:20.833
You are unworthy of the power
of Apocalypse.

16:20.958 --> 16:24.583
Return to
your wretched existence!

16:25.166 --> 16:27.458
[screaming in pain]

16:33.416 --> 16:36.708
I would have destroyed you,
traitor,

16:36.708 --> 16:39.458
but it is not my place.

16:39.458 --> 16:43.500
Apocalypse shall cull the weak
from the herd.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.333
You will bear witness
to his return

16:46.333 --> 16:48.875
and he will pass judgment.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
It is time.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.208
Rejoice!

16:55.333 --> 16:58.125
My moment is at hand!

16:58.250 --> 17:00.458
My Lord, accept this vessel.

17:00.583 --> 17:04.500
Your humble servants await
the glory of your rebirth!

You will not leave this place!

Get lost!

Hank, are you okay?

18:38.750 --> 18:41.125
Not really, no.

18:41.125 --> 18:44.125
Let's go.
We've got to get out of here.

No!

19:06.833 --> 19:09.708
Cortez! We must save him!

19:09.708 --> 19:11.875
But the whole place
is coming down!

19:16.291 --> 19:18.250
[crumbling]

19:19.208 --> 19:21.208
I think the truck is this way.
Hurry!

19:21.208 --> 19:22.750
Erm, about the truck,
Jubilee...

19:23.500 --> 19:26.750
Come on, Caliban,
we're going home.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.750
No.

19:28.250 --> 19:32.291
Caliban does not
deserve Jubilee's help.

19:32.291 --> 19:34.458
Cortez messed with your head.

19:34.458 --> 19:36.458
It's not your fault.

19:36.458 --> 19:39.458
I'm just glad you were there
for us when it counted.

19:39.583 --> 19:41.083
Thank you.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.083
My Lord!

19:46.083 --> 19:47.833
Forgive me.

19:47.833 --> 19:51.000
I no longer have a vessel

19:51.000 --> 19:52.333
for your return.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.208
But you have provided me

19:55.208 --> 19:57.000
with a vessel, Cortez.

19:57.125 --> 20:00.250
I don't understand, my Lord.
