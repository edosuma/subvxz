01:20.960 --> 01:23.190
Sorry.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.272
Sorry.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.996
You take your nanny skiing,
the cost mounts up.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.071
So leave her at home.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.354
You still have to pay her.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.510
On holiday, you want your nanny most.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.514
But they see it as their holiday, too.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.754
Gabrielle even wanted us
to pay for a lift pass.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.274
In a ski resort, what else can you do?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.749
But you pay for flights, accommodation,
food...

01:53.840 --> 01:55.671
Actually, we didn't pay for food.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.955
Nannies make whatever demands they want.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.350
You don't want to go to the trouble
of finding a replacement.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.874
And the children get attached to them.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.518
Psst. Karen.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.071
What are you doing?

02:12.160 --> 02:14.071
Who are these people?

02:14.160 --> 02:16.230
They are our friends.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.912
What does that say about you?

02:18.640 --> 02:19.789
Sorry?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.591
Look at them.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.797
Is it something they put in the water
makes them stupid?

02:25.880 --> 02:28.155
I mean, take James here.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.876
He earns what? Six figures.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.789
Begrudges his nanny a living wage.

02:38.840 --> 02:42.435
His wife, Natasha...hangs on his every word.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.798
You wouldn't think
she has a degree in economics, would you?

02:48.360 --> 02:50.112
David...

02:51.160 --> 02:53.230
Well, David's David, isn't he?

02:54.360 --> 02:56.430
Just wants everyone to get on.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.511
Laura...

03:03.600 --> 03:05.795
Didn't you go backpacking with her once?

03:06.630 --> 03:09.755
We stayed in an
ashram in India together.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.630
Well, unless it's become part of the
Hilton chain, she won't be going back.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.799
Mark.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.156
Barely said a word all night,
which is probably just as well.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.800
It's about the only thing he's got
going for him.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.475
I mean, look at him.
Middle-aged, going on dead.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.553
Finally...

03:29.640 --> 03:31.437
You, Karen.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.873
What about me?

03:32.960 --> 03:35.633
When you were young,
you wanted to be outstanding.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.631
I've got news for you.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.472
You don't stand out at all.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.795
In fact, you fit right in.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.231
&1,5oo.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.153
It'll be worth double that in a few years.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.879
Would you excuse me a minute, please?

03:59.200 --> 04:02.237
Has anyone been to that new restaurant
on Deansgate?

04:02.320 --> 04:04.231
Yes. Marvellous.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.673
Help.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.671
What's the matter?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.352
I thlnk I've died and gone to hell.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.509
Worse, actually.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.672
I'm still here and this is my life.
Where are you?

04:13.760 --> 04:15.432
Bar Nexus.
- Can I come?

04:15.520 --> 04:17.829
But I thought you were having
a dinner party.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.387
Yeah, but I'm not sure I can stand it.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.550
You know the best way to handle that.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.393
Rachel, I'm already pissed.
- Well, then, roll a joint.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.391
I tell you, I wouId if I had any dope.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.439
You might just find a stray spliff
in my bedside table.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.431
Second drawer down.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.431
Seriously?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.512
I knew I could rely on you. Thanks.
- No problem.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.192
Bye.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.516
I love auctions.
There's always the chance to find a bargain.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.832
Last week I stumbled on a painting and
I think it might be by the Norwich School.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.957
Well, it's of a Norwich School!

04:52.040 --> 04:54.315
Karen, you studied art history.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.196
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
Would anybody like some?

05:05.920 --> 05:08.718
I've got to be up early.
- I don't, thanks.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.073
Were you out of your mlnd?

05:15.160 --> 05:17.720
Briefly. I don't think it was
very good stuff.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.790
I've never been so embarrassed.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.236
School nativity play -
one of the Three Wise Men wet themselves.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.958
Your mother told me.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.634
You do not offer marijuana
at dinner parties.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.075
You offered Cuban cigars, which smell worse.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.116
Yeah, but they're not illegal.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.997
In America they are.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.156
I'm sorry, David, but I was bored.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.196
Bored bloody rigid.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.793
You were certalnly quiet.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.393
If you got more involved...

05:43.480 --> 05:46.552
I had no interest
in discussing nannies again.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.790
That isn't all we talked about.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.997
Or skiing, house prices or
private education.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.191
You could have started a conversation.
- David, I tried.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.191
Oh, yeah.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.271
There's a tribe in Borneo,

06:00.360 --> 06:04.114
where instead of shaking hands,
men masturbate one other.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.831
They'll never invite us back.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.275
Thank God. We won't have
to admire their antiques.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.828
What's got into you?
They're our friends.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.272
I know.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.590
I'll never be able to sleep tonight.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.432
You would if you'd only relax.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.078
How do you suggest I do that?

06:28.160 --> 06:29.912
I didn't finish it.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.110
Buongiorno.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.153
There you go.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.310
Look at that.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.710
I'll deal with him. You lie in.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.075
Blimey! What have I done to deserve this?

06:56.720 --> 06:59.029
Actually, Pete, what have you done?

06:59.120 --> 07:00.997
How do you mean?

07:01.080 --> 07:02.991
Joking.

07:03.080 --> 07:07.232
Come on. It's nice.
I feel a bit like a princess, eh!

07:08.280 --> 07:11.352
Anything for me?
- Yeah, there's a couple.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.431
There you go, love.
- Ta.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.272
Oh, no.
- What?

07:15.360 --> 07:17.271
It's from my old school.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.590
After them library books again?

07:27.840 --> 07:29.990
I've been invited to a reunion.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.230
Blimey, that makes me feel old.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.276
<i>Mmm. Class of '84.</i>

07:35.600 --> 07:37.158
Are you going to go?

07:37.240 --> 07:40.357
Of course I'm not going.
- Come on. It will be fun.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.956
What? Standing round with guys
who were wankers then and estate agents now?

07:45.040 --> 07:46.314
I don't think so.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.396
At least you aren't like them.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.436
That's what I really object to!

07:50.520 --> 07:53.637
''A chance to catch up with old mates.''
Bollocks!

07:53.720 --> 07:57.952
A chance to see who's doing better
or worse. I'm not playing.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.758
On principle?
- Yeah.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.400
Not because you'll suffer by comparison?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.351
Face it, Pete.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.795
I have nothing to show for my life.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.637
God, I'm not even divorced.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.796
I wonder if Amanda Wagstaff will go.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.395
Amanda?
- I bet you'd like to see her again.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.391
Yeah.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.755
Oh, yeah.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.831
Maybe I can meet her husband.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.990
Maybe she'll show photos of her children.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.150
She split up from her husband.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.515
So my mum says. Having an affair.
- The bollocks!

08:32.600 --> 08:34.716
Hang on. You don't know it was his fault.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.552
Phuh! Excuse me.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.995
You don't know what his marriage was like.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.991
But if he had an affair...

08:41.080 --> 08:44.152
Not strictly an affair.
He only slept with her once.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.158
Your mother's intelligence is very good.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.072
Yeah. Yeah.
Erm, so do you want to go, or what?

08:53.160 --> 08:55.116
Oh. How much is it?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.798
40 quid?

08:57.880 --> 09:00.030
Oh, that's for a double ticket.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.155
Double?

09:03.280 --> 09:05.589
Thanks for agreeing to meet me.

09:05.680 --> 09:09.309
I almost didn't,
after that scene in the restaurant.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.153
Then I thought maybe you wanted
to apologise.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.912
I do.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.916
Well, go on, then.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.396
I apologise.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.870
I'm sorry I had a go at you
and your boyfriend.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.598
With the emphasis on ''boy''.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.633
I was embarrassed - you know,
Lonely Hearts...

09:33.720 --> 09:35.233
Was that your first?

09:35.320 --> 09:36.833
God, and last.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.593
I mean, Callie was the best of the bunch.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.636
Look how that turned out.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.793
No, I think I'd rather embrace celibacy.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.030
Can you embrace celibacy?

09:48.120 --> 09:51.078
So long as it doesn't lead anywhere.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.591
Do you really want to spend your life
with someone called Callie?

09:57.960 --> 09:59.916
Whereas, Danny...

10:01.360 --> 10:03.476
Do you think we can be friends?

10:05.160 --> 10:07.071
I don't think we can.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.116
I'd like to be.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.950
Maybe see a movie once in a while.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.474
Meet at parties without embarrassment.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.879
Yeah.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.918
Invite each other to...school reunions.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.594
Yeah.
- So you'll come?

10:23.680 --> 10:26.274
To a movie?
- No, to a school reunion.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.271
Say you will. Say you will.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.193
I don't want to go on my own or take a date.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.589
Amanda will be there, my first girlfriend.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.910
Her marriage has just split up.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.513
Pete and Jen will be there.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.516
OK.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.793
Hiya.
- Hi.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.791
Hi.

10:45.880 --> 10:49.236
Are you ready?
- Yeah. We're going to the cinema.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.952
Do you want to come?

10:52.040 --> 10:53.951
No.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.838
I've got...something...to do.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.831
What are you going to see?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.148
King Of Comedy.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.674
De Niro. We enjoyed that one, didn't we?

11:21.160 --> 11:23.230
What are you doing after work?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.072
I meant to talk to you about that.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.071
Good.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.071
Pete. Pete, relax.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.675
People will think we're having
a meeting, not an affair.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.716
Hey, we're not...

11:35.960 --> 11:37.871
We're not having an affair.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.190
That's what I want to talk about.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.918
We...

11:42.960 --> 11:46.077
We slept together once. That's it, right?

11:46.160 --> 11:49.311
You're forgetting the following morning.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.073
Well, I only count it as th... as the...

11:52.160 --> 11:56.597
What happened when we went away
won't happen again, right?

11:56.680 --> 11:59.194
So, you...
- Post.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.476
So you've sorted out your problems
with Jenny?

12:08.560 --> 12:10.630
Yes. Yes, I'm taking steps to.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.631
Have you spoken to her?

12:12.720 --> 12:14.631
That's the next step.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.995
Pete Gifford's phone.
- Hello.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.072
Oh, hiya, Jenny. It's Amy. Yeah.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.470
Yeah, he's just here. I'll pass him on.
Hang on.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.918
Hi.
- Hiya, Jen. Yeah.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.592
The cheque? No, the cheque's by the phone.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.596
Listen, I erm...

12:40.640 --> 12:42.471
I might have to work late tonight.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.471
OK.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.471
About eight. Yeah.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.471
Right.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.596
Eight thirty. Thereabouts.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.190
OK.
- OK.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.000
See you, love. Bye.
- See you later, yeah?

13:21.680 --> 13:25.434
How the hell did I manage
to accumulate so much tat?

13:25.520 --> 13:28.239
Shopping, I'd imagine.
- Well, it's time it went.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.598
If you saw a woman wearing this,
what would you think?

13:32.680 --> 13:34.636
That her husband's rich.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.358
Or she is.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.796
Either way, that she is impressed by wealth.
Well, I am not so shallow.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.474
You really hated that dinner party.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.869
No. It helped me see things clearly.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.794
I've become the sort of woman
I used to despise. It was a revelation.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.316
Like an out-of-body experience.
- Had you had the dope by then?

13:52.400 --> 13:56.029
I wanted to grab each of those people,
shake them and scream,

13:56.120 --> 14:00.750
''For God's sake, wake up, take a look at
yourselves before it's too late.''

14:01.760 --> 14:03.113
Isn't that Prada?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.953
Can you tell?
- Yeah.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.956
Wait, wait! I'll have it.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.556
You could take it up.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.151
You can't take up Prada.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.869
I want to strip away my life,
cut through all the crap

14:19.960 --> 14:22.918
and get back to the real me.
I've become so conformist!

14:23.000 --> 14:26.515
You have dope in your bedside table.
I have Joanna Trollope.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.238
Yeah, but it's Danny's.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.915
You get distracted by bullshit.
Why you must have an Aga.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.198
What Caribbean island is in.
What colour's the latest black.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.474
Isn't it black?

14:37.560 --> 14:41.269
Who gives a shit? The chattering classes
who can't think themselves

14:41.360 --> 14:43.669
and rely on the media to form their views.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.637
Right...

14:45.720 --> 14:47.597
What's that?
- Nothing.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.591
Let's have a gander.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.636
You wouldn't approve.

14:52.640 --> 14:56.918
It's a questionnaire. ''Your boyfriend:
Hump him or dump him?''

14:57.000 --> 14:59.560
Oh, I love those things.
- Isn't it media bullshit?

14:59.640 --> 15:04.111
It's just a bit of fun. It's not like
you're taking it seriously, is it?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.519
No, of course not.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.511
OK. Question one.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.750
''Sex.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.957
Is sex, A: something you're
keen to avoid?

15:13.040 --> 15:14.996
B: Willing to suffer?

15:15.720 --> 15:17.597
Or C: Gagging for more of?''

15:41.840 --> 15:43.796
C.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.030
Three points. Question two.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.590
''In the morning,
does your boyfriend bring you...

15:49.680 --> 15:51.477
A: The post?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.471
B: Fowers?

15:53.560 --> 15:55.516
Or C: Another orgasm?''

16:10.040 --> 16:11.951
All three.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.951
Fantastic.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.951
OK.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.951
Three, four, five, six.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.473
Are you sure you need to do it all?

16:19.560 --> 16:21.471
I know. I know. It's just...

16:21.560 --> 16:22.709
Well, he's very young.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.030
Isn't that why he's scoring so well?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.111
Yeah, but so are his friends.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.909
It's a terrible waste,
but Richey Manic, he is dead.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.869
No way, man. He's alive and well. He's in
India. Crispin's seen him there.

16:35.960 --> 16:40.351
Crispin, Crispin...
- He's in the mud under the Severn Bridge.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.557
Oh, no. I did see his face in
a cloud formation.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.790
Your head's a cloud formation.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.111
When he disappeared,
part of me went with him.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.788
To Richey.
- To Richey, man.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.956
To Richey.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.911
OK, so his friends are awful.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.309
David's were when I first met him.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.278
But you are not going out with his friends
but Danny.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.589
Mmm. Who's fun and intelligent.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.477
And sex on legs.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.231
Yeah. Case closed.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.276
Horoscopes.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.911
Hiya, love. Sorry I'm late.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.036
Work dragged on, you know.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.270
It's all right. Are you hungry?

17:27.359 --> 17:29.430
No. I got a burger coming home.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.478
I would have rung, but I had to crack on
with the audit.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.437
Get it finished?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.875
No, no. One mistake leads to a hundred.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.838
I'll have to work a few more late nlghts.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.876
Poor, overworked fool.

17:55.080 --> 17:59.039
Weren't you bringing me breakfast?
- I don't want to be late for work.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.429
Danny, I'm your boss.
You don't have to worry.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.628
Look...

18:10.160 --> 18:11.639
We need to talk.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.269
He's dumped you? - That's where
'''We have to talk'' tends to lead.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.271
Why?

18:17.360 --> 18:19.316
It's your friends.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.311
Me?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.311
And David, Pete and Jenny.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.153
And Adam. He was never very keen on Adam.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.198
Yeah, well, Adam I can understand,
but what's wrong with us?

18:29.280 --> 18:31.111
Nothing, but...

18:31.200 --> 18:33.270
they're not my kind of people.

18:33.360 --> 18:37.831
You mean, they don't sit around
talking about Richey Manic.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.353
Would David even know who he was?

18:41.040 --> 18:43.474
You're not going out with them, but me.

18:43.560 --> 18:48.315
But friends are important. That's the people
who you want to spend time with.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.994
I don't want to spend time with yours.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.355
I...I'll change my friends.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.796
Excuse me!
- I didn't mean it. He caught me unawares.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.393
Anyway, I was going to dump him.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.391
That's rather ironic, Rachel.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.677
Still, at least it's not any
great loss, is it?

19:03.760 --> 19:05.876
Oh, come on.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.393
No-one likes being dumped.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.715
And he did have a beautiful body!

19:12.000 --> 19:14.798
You know what you should do
when you feel down...

19:14.880 --> 19:16.791
Spend a lot of money?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.836
Something wild.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.036
Hello.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.390
What about a heart wrapped in a scroll,
inscribed ''David''?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.835
What if we get divorced?
- Pessimist.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.911
Pragmatist.
- Or a death's head skull.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.275
Rachel! I want it to be tasteful.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.509
Karen, it's a tattoo.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.512
Have you seen anything you like?
- Only the exit.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.352
She's getting one, too.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.351
I really like this lizard.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.351
Actually, it's a gecko.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.000
Ooh. Even better. It's more exotic.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.237
Do you give me a local
or a general anaesthetic?

20:04.760 --> 20:06.239
It's her first time.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.637
Thank you so much.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.193
So, what else is new?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.191
Oh, you know. This and that.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.236
Nothing. Same here.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.596
I doubt it.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.959
Adam.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.157
Here, I wanted salt and vinegar.
- It doesn't matter.

20:27.240 --> 20:30.073
We don't like prawn cocktail.
- Really. It doesn't matter.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.151
I'll change them.
- No, stop!

20:32.760 --> 20:34.193
Sit down!

20:35.200 --> 20:37.156
All right, all right.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.949
I have something to tell you.
You mustn't tell a soul.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.110
Sure.
- I'm serious.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.679
What, no-one?
- No-one.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.273
Not even Giggsy?

20:48.120 --> 20:49.553
Not even Giggsy.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.596
OK. I give you my word.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.156
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.559
What?
- Change the crisps.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.551
Bollocks to that! What is it?

20:58.640 --> 21:01.837
You can't ask me to keep a secret,
then clam up.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.878
It'd be wrong to involve you.
- Let me make that decision.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.428
I want to be involved. We're mates.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.671
I'm cheating on Jenny.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.637
Yeah, right!
- No, really.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.154
And the fruit machine here pays a jackpot!

21:16.240 --> 21:18.151
Believe it. It's true.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.438
Yes!

21:21.520 --> 21:23.476
Hold on. Wait a minute.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.631
Who with?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.438
Amy from work.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.873
Amy who's nuts?

21:29.960 --> 21:33.270
She's not.
She's sympathetic and understanding.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.271
Yeah, and nuts.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.271
Are you out of your mind?

21:37.360 --> 21:38.679
I know she is.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.676
How did this happen?

21:41.760 --> 21:45.196
You know how me and Jenny
haven't been getting along?

21:45.280 --> 21:47.191
Yep.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.191
<i>Of course you do.</i>

21:49.280 --> 21:51.794
We were on this Outward Bound thing,

21:51.880 --> 21:55.509
and it started raining
and we got soaked to the skin.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.876
From there it's a short step to sex!
- No, we got lost in the woods.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.394
You did it in the woods?
- No. In a motel.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.232
God, how...sordid.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.675
It was a nice motel. I couldn't stop myself.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.671
Cos she's a nymphomaniac.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.432
No, she's not.
- She was with me.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.873
She wanted to keep you.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.077
You don't understand her.
She's quite sensitive.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.232
You didn't deserve her.
- Jenny doesn't deserve you!

22:17.320 --> 22:21.199
Does she know about this?
- Of course not! She mustn't find out.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.879
You promised!
- Before I knew what it was.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.315
She'd kill me!
- No more than you deserve.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.789
Hang on.

22:31.880 --> 22:36.510
She says she doesn't love me any more
and tries to get off with you!

22:41.160 --> 22:43.071
Jen made a fool of herself, right?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.832
She regrets it.

22:44.920 --> 22:49.869
She's trying to repair the damage,
but what you're dolng, Pete...

22:49.960 --> 22:51.871
God...

22:51.960 --> 22:54.793
Where are you going?
- Home.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.791
Oh, cheers. Thanks.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.678
Thanks for being supportive!
- I'm not doing supportive.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.716
Try Amy.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.351
You're in agony, aren't you?

23:14.440 --> 23:16.351
No, just a bit of pain.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.396
No more than childbirth.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.874
I've finished. Not a bad job, is it?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.712
It's almost like a gecko.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.869
That wasn't too bad.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.632
You were passed out!

23:27.720 --> 23:29.153
What does it look like?

23:29.240 --> 23:30.912
It's really not that bad.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.430
Are you getting one done?
- No.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.473
No!

23:44.240 --> 23:47.516
Ramona! So sorry! I thought you were Karen.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.596
I'm terribly sorry.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.556
Karen.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.716
I've just assaulted Ramona.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.789
What? Why?

23:59.880 --> 24:01.552
I thought she was you.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.909
She was bending over and...you know,

24:05.000 --> 24:06.911
gander, gander, goosey.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.479
David, you know I hate that.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.757
I didn't know it was her.
She had your dress on.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.479
The Prada.
- Prada?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.755
Or Jil Sander, if it was a yellow one.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.638
It was black.
- Yeah, that is Prada.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.631
You gave her two dresses?

24:21.720 --> 24:23.995
Three, actually. The rest,
I gave to charity.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.593
What?

24:25.680 --> 24:29.309
I don't want them, so I gave them
to a good cause. Pass me a towel.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.223
Why not help the starving in Africa?

24:31.718 --> 24:34.394
They're as thin as supermodels,
they can dress like them.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.516
Right, I'm going to sort out Ramona.

24:36.600 --> 24:40.354
You have a smudge on your back.
- It's a tattoo, and it's a gecko.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.749
A tattoo? Are you out of your mind?

24:42.840 --> 24:44.831
Don't you like geckos?

24:44.920 --> 24:46.319
Why did you get a tattoo?

24:46.400 --> 24:48.516
David, I just thought it would be fun.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.275
Fun?
- David, you're doing it again.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.793
Stop repeating what I say.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.633
Fun? Tattoos are permanent, you know.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.790
What are we going to tell Josh?

24:58.880 --> 25:01.633
- ''Mummy was a Hell's Angel''?
- David, it's body art.

25:01.720 --> 25:06.077
I'm seriously worried about you.
Smoking dope at dinner parties,

25:06.160 --> 25:10.756
giving designer dresses to Oxfam,
and now mutilating yourself.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.913
And you're a model citizen -
apart from sexually harassing the nanny!

25:16.400 --> 25:19.312
Was that Adam?
- No, wrong number, love.

25:19.400 --> 25:23.109
Is he coming out for a drink?
Are we meeting him there?

25:23.200 --> 25:26.909
We're running late,
so we're probably best meeting him there.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.956
All right.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.596
Amanda Wagstaff!

25:43.320 --> 25:44.912
No.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.552
Hi. Remember me?

25:48.400 --> 25:50.038
No.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.036
Fancy a shag?

25:53.840 --> 25:55.751
Yeah!

25:57.840 --> 26:00.991
Please leave a message for David,
Karen and Josh...

26:01.080 --> 26:03.196
or Ramona, after the tone.

26:04.400 --> 26:08.791
Karen, it's Rachel.
You owe me one and I'm calling it in.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.873
I said I'd go to Adam's school reunion
and I can't make it.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.871
I'm stuck at the doctor's.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.871
My tattoo's still sore.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.953
He's going to be upset if he has to go
on his own. Please go.

26:21.040 --> 26:25.556
It's er, Sharman Cross School,
Alderbrook Road, Wythenshawe.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.438
I'm due to meet him in an hour. Please go.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.198
I hope you get this message.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.311
Blimey, it's a bit low-rent.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.470
Like something out of Carrie.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.437
I'm not happy with this name tag.

26:46.120 --> 26:49.157
Pond Scum - it wasn't my only
school nickname.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.196
What was your other one?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.436
Smegma.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.716
Hey!

27:02.200 --> 27:04.031
Great, they're coming over.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.473
Yeah.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.471
Hiya.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.516
Oh, hiya.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.432
Adam.

27:18.520 --> 27:21.557
Hey, Karen. Why are you here?
- Rach can't make it, so I came.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.428
Oh, great...
- I'm her stand-in.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.115
Great. Er...let's do it.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.758
What do I have to do, then?

27:30.840 --> 27:33.877
This girl, Amanda Wagstaff,
is gagging for it.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.479
Thanks for not saying anything to Jen.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.196
Oh, my God.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.510
Amanda.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.511
Adam.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.637
Oh, er...I wasn't sure you'd remember.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.995
Well, the name tag helped.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.308
Oh, yeah.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.118
Of course I remember you.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.838
How are you?
- I'm great.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.639
God, you look fantastic. How are you?

28:35.720 --> 28:37.676
Yeah. I'm fine.

28:38.720 --> 28:42.315
Who are you with?
- Tall blonde woman with Pete.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.960
With Pond Scum?
- Yeah.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.598
She's just a friend.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.716
Very attractive.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.711
Yeah...

28:50.800 --> 28:51.835
What about you?

28:51.920 --> 28:53.990
Yeah, I'm with a friend, as well.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.595
Jill. Oh, she's the girl talking
to Jamie Franks.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.432
Very attractive, too.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.194
I was sorry...
- So what do you...

29:05.280 --> 29:07.510
Oh. Hmm.
- Go on. You first.

29:08.560 --> 29:11.438
I was sorry to hear about your marriage.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.033
That it was in trouble, I mean.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.471
It was in trouble, wasn't it?
- It's erm... It's over.

29:17.560 --> 29:19.630
Your husband had an affair.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.278
Where did you get that from?

29:21.360 --> 29:22.679
Pete's mum.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.870
It was me that had the affair.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.871
Oh. Is it still going on?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.279
No.

29:30.360 --> 29:34.512
No. I erm... I left her and now
I'm with Jill.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.595
Hey.
- Hey.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.638
God, no wonder I never got past first base.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.678
She's got two kids.
Her husband obviously did, then.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.036
Thanks for coming, Karen.
I think we can go now.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.031
No, it's only just started!

30:18.120 --> 30:20.076
Come with me.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.994
God, I can't believe this, you know.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.230
I used to sneak in here for a sly fag.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.470
15 years later, and I still do it.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.915
For God's sake, don't tell David.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.918
I'm good at keeping secrets. Don't worry.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.230
No, nothing. It doesn't matter.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.231
Do you want to see my tattoo?

30:50.320 --> 30:52.276
You've got a tattoo?

30:53.440 --> 30:55.351
Oh, fantastic!

30:55.440 --> 30:57.237
It's a gecko.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.639
I had it done last week.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.870
You're amazing, you know that?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.916
Tattoos, wacky baccy.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.150
Unbelievable.

31:05.240 --> 31:08.789
You're not at all like what you seem.
Whereas me...

31:08.880 --> 31:10.791
You can be whoever you want.

31:10.880 --> 31:14.077
No-one here knows you, except
Pete and Jenny.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.357
If you don't like who you are,
become someone else.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.352
What, and invent a life?
- Live a lie.

31:20.440 --> 31:23.955
Yeah, well. I wouldn't be
the only one doing that.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.469
What?

31:28.840 --> 31:33.072
If I tell you, promise not to breathe
a word of this to anyone.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.434
Yeah.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.514
We tell her. She has a right to know.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.875
I promised Pete I wouldn't. You promised me.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.030
We're meant to be her friends.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.190
We're meant to be Pete's, too.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.555
They have got to sort this out between them.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.870
How can they, if she doesn't know?

31:49.960 --> 31:52.269
We act like nothing has happened.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.271
Perfectly normal, OK?

31:54.360 --> 31:55.634
Karen, OK?

32:13.040 --> 32:16.828
After the Foreign Legion,
I was bodyguard to a sultan.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.753
He was assassinated.
- Yeah, it was my day off.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.798
We're not married.
Karen's my personal assistant.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.029
And masseuse.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.838
And helicopter pilot.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.593
The year after school, I made a million.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.150
The year after, he lost it.
- The year after that, I made it back.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.876
Come on. Come on.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.828
It's easier the second time round.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.474
You've got to tell her.
- No, she's happy.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.834
She's drunk.
- No.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.718
Adam.
- Rach, hi.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.917
You made it, then.
- Just. They wouldn't let me in.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.198
I said you were my husband. - You want
to hear the shite we've been saying.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.111
Thanks for coming, Karen.
- OK.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.191
How's it been going?

33:15.280 --> 33:17.635
So far, so good.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.756
I think I'll get some drinks.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.071
Ah, Mr Turnbull.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.879
Teacher?
- Tosser.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.269
Oh, God, you have to meet this guy.

33:41.240 --> 33:46.075
You know how they say you never
forget a good teacher? This is...

33:46.160 --> 33:47.639
Erm...

33:47.720 --> 33:51.838
Malcolm Chacksfield.
You still haven't lost your sense of humour.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.070
You always could make me laugh.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.878
Usually when I marked his essays.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.911
Karen, give us some of that.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.434
I'm that dehydrated, I can't even pee.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.431
Are you having a good time?

34:07.520 --> 34:10.273
Mmm. Yeah, I'm having a laugh actually.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.271
Do you know what?

34:12.360 --> 34:15.431
In this hall, Pete and I had our first kiss.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.431
Did you?

34:17.520 --> 34:20.637
With tongues. We were lashing at each other.

34:20.719 --> 34:25.873
15 years ago. That's how long
we've been together. I can't believe it.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.110
Quite an achievement, really.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.156
Jen.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.034
If your friend's husband was having an
affair, would you tell her?

34:38.480 --> 34:40.391
Er... Yeah.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.835
Yeah. God, yeah. If you're a mate.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.876
Definitely.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.155
I'll be back for a dance.
I'm going for a slash.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.315
Jen!

34:51.840 --> 34:55.196
Mr Chacksfield is why I did computing.
- You teach computing?

34:55.280 --> 34:58.636
English, and it's Malcolm.
You make me feel old.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.870
I'm old, so you must be...

35:00.960 --> 35:04.396
45.
- Is that all? When we were at school...

35:04.480 --> 35:06.948
I was still young.
I just seemed ancient to you.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.951
Adam? Adam?

35:09.040 --> 35:10.359
Where's Pete?

35:10.440 --> 35:12.431
I don't know. Having a slash?

35:12.520 --> 35:15.159
Er... I'll start with you, then.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.151
Please, outside.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.669
Karen should never have told you.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.671
No, Adam, you should have!

35:27.760 --> 35:30.354
I promised Pete I'd keep it to myself.

35:30.440 --> 35:32.271
So you tell Karen!

35:32.360 --> 35:35.113
Advertising?
Would I know any adverts you worked on?

35:35.200 --> 35:39.990
I should bloody well hope so. We've got a
big campaign with a skateboarding nun.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.638
I don't watch a lot of TV.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.392
It's on billboards.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.232
I don't get out much.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.991
I'll rip his throat out!

35:49.080 --> 35:50.559
You do not want to do that.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.598
Yes, I do! The bastard's having an affair!

35:53.680 --> 35:56.672
Yeah. And why do you think he's doing that?

36:23.400 --> 36:25.436
Do you love him?
- Shut up!

36:26.920 --> 36:30.879
Yeah!
- He doesn't know that.

36:30.960 --> 36:34.635
If you confront him, I'm telling you
it will destroy your marriage.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.632
What if he stops seeing her?
- What will make him do that?

36:37.720 --> 36:40.712
I am. If he doesn't,
you can rip his throat out.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.313
I'll hold him down.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.791
I feel sick, Adam.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.836
I feel sick.

36:51.720 --> 36:54.359
Hey, Karen, do you want to dance?

36:54.440 --> 36:56.396
Yeah. Not with you.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.231
Hiya, love.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.233
I want to go home.
- In a minute.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.276
Now.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.037
When are you working late
at the office again?

37:14.120 --> 37:17.078
Monday. I hope you haven't said anything.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.230
No, but if you carry on, I will.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.231
It's over, Pete. Dump her.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.392
You can't tell me what to do.
- Give me your word. I'm serious.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.914
I'm telling Jenny.
Do you want to wreck your marriage?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.309
Only see your kid at the weekends?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.516
Tell Amy it's finished, Pete.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.116
I'm off.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.356
I think I'll go, too.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.312
Have you seen Rach?

37:44.640 --> 37:46.596
She's dancing over there.

37:57.960 --> 38:01.396
I turn my back and she cops off
with my teacher!

38:01.480 --> 38:05.632
They were hardly copping off.
They were dancing together.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.995
He asked her out.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.036
And she accepted?

38:10.920 --> 38:11.989
Why not?

38:12.080 --> 38:15.914
He was my teacher! It's indecent.
Besides, what about Danny?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.833
I finished with him. A few days ago.

38:18.920 --> 38:21.832
What did you do that for? I liked Danny.

38:21.920 --> 38:25.799
You didn't.
You'd just rather I saw Danny than Malcolm.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.030
Malcolm? It's Mr Chacksfield!

38:28.120 --> 38:30.031
What is going on, Rachel?

38:30.120 --> 38:32.554
One boyfriend was pre-pubescent.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.551
This one is due his bus pass.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.269
Are you trying to do all the seven ages
of man? - Do I detect a note of jealousy?

38:38.360 --> 38:39.395
No.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.391
Good.

38:41.480 --> 38:46.076
If we're friends, we can't be stupid
about who the other one sees.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.789
She has a point.
- He was my favourite teacher!

38:49.880 --> 38:52.314
When he went on about Romeo And Juliet

38:52.400 --> 38:55.437
I didn't think he'd shag my ex-girlfriend.

38:55.520 --> 38:59.672
Do you think they'll shag? - Yeah.
They're grown-ups. Him in particular.

38:59.760 --> 39:03.230
Oh, yes. Marvellous end
to a marvellous evening!

39:03.320 --> 39:06.232
Yeah. I heard about Pete.
- God.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.231
Karen said you'd told her.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.834
She said I was to keep quiet about it.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.831
Well, more than she's done.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.273
What? Did she tell Rachel?

39:14.360 --> 39:16.271
Rachel? Jenny.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.193
Hello.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.236
So, is he home?

39:23.320 --> 39:26.596
Yeah. He's early, actually.
I can't believe it.

39:26.680 --> 39:30.878
Maybe it's the lure of Carol Vorderman.
At least he's here.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.679
There will be occasions
when he does have to work late.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.671
I know.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.354
But I think it's going to be all right.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.954
I feel good. It's been really nice.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.918
You deserve it, Jen. Have a good evening.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.911
Thanks.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.353
Adam?
- Yeah.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.351
Thank you.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.112
OK.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.111
Bye.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.871
Look, there's Mum.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.916
Hiya, love. Give us a kiss.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.312
What are you doing, Ramona?
- Tidying up.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.913
If you let me.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.718
Is this yours?

40:16.800 --> 40:18.916
It's Javier's. Karen says it's
OK in my room.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.797
Is this place a crack den?

40:20.880 --> 40:23.189
Karen knows my attitude towards drugs.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.793
Drugs?

40:24.880 --> 40:27.235
- I will not tolerate them here.
- This is not drugs.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.231
Where does it end, Ramona?

40:29.320 --> 40:31.151
It starts with marijuana,

40:31.240 --> 40:34.596
and before you know, you're robbing
old ladies to pay for cocaine.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.954
This is no marijuana!

40:36.040 --> 40:37.951
You're in denial. It's a slippery slope.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.953
David, this is tobacco.
Javier likes to roll his own.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.393
So it's harmless?

40:44.480 --> 40:46.675
No, it is tobacco.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.716
It gives you cancer.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.431
So, how did your date go?

40:55.520 --> 40:57.476
With Malcolm?

40:57.560 --> 40:59.835
Yeah, with Malcolm.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.073
It didn't.
- What, he cancelled?

41:03.160 --> 41:06.072
No!
- You did?

41:06.160 --> 41:08.071
No.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.115
So?

41:10.320 --> 41:13.392
Well, I was waitlng for him in this bar...

41:25.040 --> 41:27.270
He was dressed llke a teacher.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.429
He is a teacher.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.751
It's the school holidays.
He still dresses like a teacher.

41:33.840 --> 41:38.356
You know you can tell in the first ten
seconds if there's anything there?

41:38.440 --> 41:40.590
Yeah.
- It didn't take that long.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.636
Oh. So what did you do?

41:43.680 --> 41:45.033
What could I do?

41:52.560 --> 41:55.632
<i>What, you scarpered?
- Yeah. I did a runner.</i>

41:55.720 --> 41:57.676
God! Mr Chacksfield...

42:00.200 --> 42:01.599
Poor bastard.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.596
Yeah. Poor bastard.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.836
Come on.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.914
Yeah. Hello.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.560
Hi, Jen.
- Hi.

42:20.640 --> 42:23.234
Guess what? I've got to work late tonight.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.231
Why?

42:25.320 --> 42:29.552
The computer's gone down and I've
got to process those figures for Patrick.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.993
He's got a meeting tomorrow.

42:31.080 --> 42:34.038
Er... How long are you going to be?

42:34.120 --> 42:37.032
I'll be able to leave in about 20 minutes.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.351
Er...that's if the computer behaves itself.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.191
OK.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.874
Erm, that's fine. The meal will keep.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.916
See you later, yeah?

42:48.000 --> 42:49.956
Yeah. All right. Bye.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.752
Pete, oh, listen. Will you...

42:53.800 --> 42:55.438
Damn...

43:01.320 --> 43:03.231
Hello.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.312
Pete, will you bring some wine...
- Who do you want?

43:06.400 --> 43:09.119
Sorry. Eh? Pete Gifford, please.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.794
I'm afraid he's left.
- He's left?

43:11.880 --> 43:13.677
Yeah.
- When did he leave?

43:13.760 --> 43:15.671
Half an hour ago.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.671
Right.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.957
Er... OK.
- Sorry.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.996
Yeah. Thanks.

43:27.400 --> 43:30.358
Why did you break a confidence?
- Adam broke it first.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.634
That doesn't excuse you.

43:31.720 --> 43:34.871
I don't need excusing.
I was being open and honest.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.076
Open and honest?

43:37.160 --> 43:39.230
Yes! Not that I expect thanks.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.357
I realise they're not qualities
people put much store by.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.351
What are you talking about?

43:44.440 --> 43:47.716
I can't stand hypocrisy.
Our whole bloody lives are a fraud.

43:47.800 --> 43:51.315
We spend time with people we don't like
and lie to those we do!

43:51.400 --> 43:53.470
You don't like Pete and Jenny?

43:53.560 --> 43:58.031
Yes, I do like them. I'm talking about
James and Natasha and Mark and Laura.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.158
Well...I don't really like them, either.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.599
So let's just tell them
we don't want to see them any more.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.240
That's not very nice.
- Who cares about being nice?

44:08.320 --> 44:09.275
I do!

44:09.360 --> 44:12.955
So once a month we have to sit there
and pretend we want to be there?

44:14.120 --> 44:17.192
If the alternative is your brand of honesty,
then, yeah.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.158
Hello.
- Hello, David.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.549
James. We were talking about you.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.676
Can you do dinner next Friday?

44:24.760 --> 44:26.796
Dinner next Friday? Erm...

44:28.880 --> 44:31.235
Oh, right...it's a bit difficult.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.914
Erm...
- How about Saturday?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.309
Saturday's no easier, I'm afraid.

44:36.400 --> 44:39.358
The week after?
- No, nor the following week.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.351
That's a shame.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.716
I tell you what,
why don't I call you when we're a bit freer?

44:44.800 --> 44:47.633
OK. I'll leave it up to you.
- OK. Bye.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.599
Well, that wasn't very honest, was it?

44:54.120 --> 44:56.076
Do you want to come in?

44:57.120 --> 45:00.078
No, I'm trying to avoid Karen at the minute.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.559
Oh, yeah.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.751
Well, that was nice.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.796
Yeah, Rach, it was.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.670
It shows that we can be friends.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.194
Going to the cinema, seeing a film...

45:16.280 --> 45:18.350
Arguing about it afterwards.

45:18.440 --> 45:20.351
Talking about who we've been seeing.

45:20.440 --> 45:22.874
You did most of the talking there.

45:24.320 --> 45:27.392
I think we can make this friends thing work.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.116
Well...

45:41.400 --> 45:43.391
I'll see you, then.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.436
I'll see you.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.630
See you at work tomorrow, then.

46:22.720 --> 46:27.396
Yeah, but it might be a good idea
if I didn't come round for a couple of days.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.954
Don't put yourself out on my account.

46:38.480 --> 46:41.358
Hiya, Jen.
- Hello, Peter.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.476
Your son wanted to say hello.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.473
There you go.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.635
Go on.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.596
Now let's see how you like it.
