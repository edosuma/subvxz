WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.918
Gordon:<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:03.004 --> 00:06.755
Richard:
Your job is to grab ingredients
from two different countries

00:06.799 --> 00:09.008
and create
an amazing fusion dish.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.843
This is not next level cooking.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.094
( bleep )

00:12.138 --> 00:13.595
the worst dishes today

00:13.639 --> 00:15.222
will all cook in
the elimination challenge,

00:15.266 --> 00:18.183
and one of you
will be going home.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.978
That dish is so raw.

00:21.022 --> 00:21.895
There's no way
we can continue eating that.

00:21.939 --> 00:22.938
That dish belongs to tricia.

00:23.232 --> 00:26.066
There's no way that
we could put you forward.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.402
You will not be
the next level chef.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.320
Oh, I failed.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.822
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:33.866
Welcome to the semifinals.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.326
Don't celebrate too hard
just yet though.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.955
For three of you,
your journey ends tonight.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.874
Nyesha: Fight for that spot
in your finale.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.126
Angie: This is it. I've gotta
take everything I've learned,

00:44.128 --> 00:46.045
and I've gotta get it
on that plate.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.254
What do you want?
What do you want?

00:47.256 --> 00:49.214
Kenny:
It's no holds barred right now.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.632
Let's do this, big boy.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.843
Courtney: It is the finale
that is on the line.

00:52.928 --> 00:55.345
Gordon: ...Two, one.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.825
Welcome back, guys.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.536
Congratulations.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.080
Welcome to the semifinals.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.956
( gasps, laughs )

01:23.000 --> 01:25.626
- thank you, chef.
- No way! ( laughs )

01:25.669 --> 01:29.755
you're all only one step away
from that finale.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.048
Wow.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.251
We're in the semifinals.
This is crazy.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.594
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so excited.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.972
<i> I've come this far.</i>
<i> I'm not gonna stop now.</i>

01:39.016 --> 01:42.017
By the end of today,

01:42.061 --> 01:44.436
only three of you will remain.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.896
Oh.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.648
- Gordon: That's right.
- Okay.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.400
For three of you,
your journey ends tonight.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.069
Wow.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.196
Reuel:<i> It's coming down</i>
<i> to the wire now.</i>

01:54.198 --> 01:57.533
110% game-on
at this point in time.

01:57.576 --> 01:58.534
Balls to the wall.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.953
There's a quarter million
dollars at stake,

02:00.996 --> 02:03.789
and maybe more importantly,

02:03.833 --> 02:05.124
that one year mentorship

02:05.167 --> 02:06.834
with richard, nyesha,
and myself.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.544
- Yes.
- Now listen, everyone.

02:09.004 --> 02:12.798
We are fortunate to be in one of
the greatest restaurant cities
in the world, las vegas.

02:12.842 --> 02:16.009
Practically every
next level chef
has a restaurant here.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.887
Joel robuchon, guy savoy,

02:18.931 --> 02:23.016
and a scottish lad
you might've heard of
named gordon.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.351
He's got a place or two in town.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.895
Five actually.

02:26.897 --> 02:30.941
But anyway, who's counting?
Now a restaurant in las vegas
has to be different.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.318
The people here
that come to dine

02:33.362 --> 02:36.321
expect an experience
that's more than just a meal.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.948
They want the wow factor.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.868
So today,
we want the six of you

02:40.911 --> 02:42.911
to give us exactly that.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.539
We want dishes
that absolutely dazzle us.

02:45.583 --> 02:50.085
We're expecting you to give us
a performance on a plate.

02:50.129 --> 02:53.005
It's showtime today.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.549
Angie:
<i> I mean, this is it.</i>

02:55.593 --> 02:59.094
I've really gotta take
everything I've learned
from this competition

02:59.138 --> 03:00.929
and I've gotta get it
on that plate.

03:00.973 --> 03:04.266
Now to give you an idea
of what we mean by showtime,

03:04.351 --> 03:07.186
we've created some dishes
of our own

03:07.229 --> 03:09.354
to help inspire you.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.939
Nyesha, why don't you
kick this off?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.065
Nyesha: Absolutely.

03:12.109 --> 03:15.068
Today I've prepared for you
a salmon.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.154
We have the salmon in two forms.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.198
I've taken off the skin
and created a chicharrón.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.657
I've also taken a leek,

03:20.743 --> 03:22.951
and I've used this leek
in three different ways.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.244
In the way of a jus

03:24.246 --> 03:27.080
by just essentially
braising the leeks,

03:27.124 --> 03:30.250
beautiful leek top dust,

03:30.252 --> 03:32.294
and then you have
the braised leeks on the bottom.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.088
This is finished
with onion sprouts.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.132
Simple. Voilà.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.509
- It's beautiful.
- Gordon: That looks stunning.

03:42.932 --> 03:46.308
- Oh, boy.
- This is a dish that
I've become known for--

03:46.352 --> 03:48.101
a beautiful
filet of beef wellington.

03:48.103 --> 03:51.813
And there's never ever
a dull moment when you
slice into one of these.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.106
Just take a look at that
in there.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.650
- Ooh!
- ( whistles )

03:54.693 --> 03:58.570
I've dreamt about chef ramsay's
beef wellington

03:58.614 --> 04:00.280
in the most polite ways.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.574
And then finally,

04:02.618 --> 04:06.078
just a red wine sauce
running throughout.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.788
- Chef, chef.
- There we are.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.998
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.959
You know,
at one of my restaurants,

04:12.002 --> 04:14.920
we only cooked
on one wood burning grill.

04:14.964 --> 04:17.005
So this is a duck dish
with turnips,

04:17.049 --> 04:19.216
apples, and black truffle.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.260
We want the guest to sort of
have this experience.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.763
The smoker with the apple chips
is filling up our glass cloche.

04:24.807 --> 04:27.182
The smell fills the dining room,

04:27.226 --> 04:29.059
and this comes to the table.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.230
- Wow.
- Yes.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.649
- Gordon: Beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.567
Mariah:<i> I feel good</i>
<i> about today's challenge</i>

04:37.611 --> 04:40.112
because I've had people tell me
I'm a little extra.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.323
And so now I get to be extra
for a reason.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.326
You'll have 40 minutes
to create a dish

04:46.370 --> 04:49.538
that is nothing short
of spectacular.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.290
One more thing.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.250
On the back of this challenge,

04:53.252 --> 04:58.213
two of you
will secure your spots

04:58.215 --> 05:00.549
directly into the finale.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.092
Ooh.

05:02.094 --> 05:05.345
The rest of you
will go head to head

05:05.389 --> 05:11.476
in your final cook-off to fight
for that last remaining spot.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.147
Cooking on the top level,

05:15.190 --> 05:17.065
mariah and angie.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.609
In the middle kitchen,
pyet, miss courtney.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.070
Sweating it out in the basement,
we have the men.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.448
All day, every day, baby.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.743
Mariah and angie,
grab the keycard on the left.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.120
Head over to the lift
and good luck.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.789
Both: Thank you, chef.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.750
( sighs )

05:34.793 --> 05:36.460
( laughs )

05:39.131 --> 05:41.173
nyesha: Fight for that spot
in your finale.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.550
- Both: Yes, chef.
- Yes!

05:46.889 --> 05:48.263
Now you two,
just very quickly.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.891
I've seen magic from both of you
in that basement before.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.226
This is personal
for all three of us.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.354
- Oh, for sure. For sure.
- 100%.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.065
- Get your ( bleep )
together, okay?
- For sure.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.276
Gordon:
<i> With kenny and reuel in the</i>
<i> basement for this challenge,</i>

06:01.362 --> 06:02.569
<i> the odds</i>
<i> are stacked against them.</i>

06:02.905 --> 06:06.156
There could be a possibility
that I may have egg on my face

06:06.200 --> 06:08.575
with none of my mentees
in the finale.

06:08.660 --> 06:12.496
Good luck, kenny.
Good luck, reuel. Come on.

06:16.335 --> 06:19.252
Last time, I got a taste
of what elimination feels like.

06:19.296 --> 06:24.007
Now I'm here,
back to day one
in the basement.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.425
There you go.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.891
Let's go.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.560
We came to play!
Let's go, let's go!

06:35.604 --> 06:40.232
So I'm in the basement
with gordon's original chefs,
kenny and reuel.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.567
I think they're both
very strong competitors.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.237
I think in the basement
will humble them,

06:45.239 --> 06:48.323
but I think it's also going to
light a fire under their ass.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.242
Excited to be with you,
gentlemen.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.582
- Right, you two ladies,
we feeling good?
- Yes.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.335
<i> To come to this far,</i>
<i> it's a major accomplishment</i>

07:00.379 --> 07:04.714
from day one when nobody
wanted to choose my dish.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.051
One cook away from getting
yourselves in the finale.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.679
<i> But I'm still competing,</i>

07:10.722 --> 07:13.223
and I really wanna be
one of those dishes
that goes right to the top.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.766
- Best of luck. Come on.
- Thank you.

07:14.810 --> 07:18.770
- Thank you, chef.
- Let's go.
You've got this, yes?

07:18.814 --> 07:20.021
- Chef blais.
- Okay, how are we doing,
mariah and angie?

07:20.357 --> 07:24.609
- Top level. Let's line up
on the back door.
- Oh, gosh.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.571
Knowing that that three people
are about to go home after this,

07:27.614 --> 07:31.950
this grab is two times
more important
than the previous grabs.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.913
- Okay, platform starts
at the top.
- Go time.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.208
Angie:<i> I have</i>
<i> serious competition below me,</i>

07:40.210 --> 07:42.335
and what I take
somebody else can't have.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.796
Don't be shy.
Don't be shy on what you need.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.089
Lots of stuff out there.

07:46.133 --> 07:50.302
So I'm not leaving
a japanese wagyu filet mignon.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.680
- I'm taking all the good stuff.
- Richard: Next level dish.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.349
- This dish can get you
to the finale.
- Sweet potato, sweet potato.

07:56.393 --> 08:01.021
Five, four, three, two, one.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.899
If you can grab it,
you know you can take it.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.151
Last looks. Last looks.

08:07.196 --> 08:11.156
Stand by. Here we go.
Three, two, one.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.952
And go, ladies. Off you go.
Off you go. Think.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.329
Think smart.
Protein, look at it.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.831
- Amazing lobster.
- Ooh.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.416
Pyet:
<i> I'm not gonna play it safe,</i>

08:21.627 --> 08:25.795
and there's nothing
that says showstopper
enough than a lobster.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.257
Let's go.
Three, two, one.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.051
- Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab.
- Do you see radish?

08:31.094 --> 08:33.845
Grab something. Grab.
Well done. Well done.

08:33.889 --> 08:37.307
- Good.
- Platform's on the move.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.809
Go! Go!
Here we go! There we go!

08:39.811 --> 08:42.854
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Make it count.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.397
Halibut.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.775
<i> But once again,</i>
<i> this is the basement.</i>

08:46.860 --> 08:47.567
Still a lot on there.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.194
You can make
something beautiful.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.780
I don't have nothing to elevate,

08:51.823 --> 08:53.782
<i> so the more I have</i>
<i> on this dish,</i>

08:53.825 --> 08:54.866
the better I'm gonna be.

08:54.910 --> 08:58.078
Nyesha: Three, two, one.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.121
Let's go.
It's still here.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.582
If you need something, grab it.
Herbs. Freshness.

09:02.626 --> 09:06.002
- Oh, missed that.
- You're all right.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.296
Okay, your 40 minutes
starts now.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.382
- Yes, chef.
- Let's make it happen.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.260
Get my focus together.
Get myself together.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.930
Potentially the spot
in the finale, okay?

09:16.932 --> 09:18.974
So excited!

09:19.017 --> 09:20.258
Make sure that pan's
nice and hot,

09:20.260 --> 09:21.560
and don't put the butter
in too early.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.647
Nyesha: Chef reuel,
talk to me about your dish.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.858
Winter roasted roots
with a nice halibut.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.361
Yes. What drives you?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.822
I've been underestimated
my whole life.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.115
A lot of people doubted me,

09:35.158 --> 09:37.117
called me crazy
for following my dreams.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.035
Cooking is the only thing
that stuck.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.746
- It is who I am.
- I can totally relate to that.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.291
I'm not everybody, where people
just do this for a job.

09:44.334 --> 09:48.795
I breathe this.
I have sacrificed,
worked for pennies.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.424
Halibut is very unforgiving,
right? It gets dry very quickly.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.675
I have to be very careful.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.386
I'm not trying to have
any mistakes on my part.

09:56.430 --> 10:00.599
Best believe I am here to win.
It's showtime.

10:05.147 --> 10:08.106
30 minutes remain.
Only 30 minutes left.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.608
- All right, angie.
- Yes, chef?

10:09.610 --> 10:12.944
- You've got
that wagyu beef filet.
- Yes, chef.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.989
You got, like,
a $400 cut of meat.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.158
I'm going to baby that thing,

10:18.201 --> 10:21.411
treat it like the best lover
I've ever had.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.954
- Mariah:
Oh. Oh, whoa, okay.
- All right.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.206
- All right.
- What else is on the dish?

10:25.208 --> 10:27.167
Angie:
Sweet potato and parsnip.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.336
I want there to be some bacon
and parm on top.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.087
This is sort of
a fine dining challenge, right?

10:31.089 --> 10:33.798
- Yes.
- So your food
is very comforting.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.884
To me,
it doesn't scream luxury.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.969
It will when I'm done with it.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.680
If I cook this steak perfectly,
and I will,

10:40.724 --> 10:44.100
<i> just by slicing and putting</i>
<i> this beef on the plate,</i>

10:44.144 --> 10:46.853
I have an award-winning dish.
It's gonna be beautiful.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.104
You got it. You do you.
You got it, angie.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.481
I'm gonna pull this off.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.775
<i> I've got to be in the finale.</i>

10:51.777 --> 10:55.195
I'm the only one
who's never had to cook
in an elimination challenge.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.697
<i> So let's do this.</i>

11:00.360 --> 11:02.160
- Nyesha: Feeling good, chef?
- Kenny: Absolutely, chef.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.621
Great pick there.
Asparagus, tomato, corn.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.956
- What's the plan
with the veal chop?
- I'm getting it on now

11:07.000 --> 11:09.209
- so I can get some time
to rest on it.
- I love that for you.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.628
I'm making
a pan seared veal chop

11:11.630 --> 11:14.339
<i> with a cream corn mascarpone</i>
<i> and truffle sauce</i>

11:14.383 --> 11:16.216
<i> and roasted vegetables.</i>

11:16.218 --> 11:17.759
- I want that woody look.
- Ooh, nice.

11:17.794 --> 11:19.844
You got a theme
for your dish, chef.
That's important.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.179
Talk to me about yourself.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.389
I haven't had time
to spend with you, my friend.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.849
- Remind me,
you have four children?
- I have four.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.434
- Two boys, two girls.
- Wow.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.769
That's my world.

11:27.813 --> 11:30.689
I do everything in life
for my kids.

11:30.691 --> 11:31.856
I gotta win this for them.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.901
Opulence, elegance, sexy plates.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.778
Yes, ma'am.
How we doing, baby?

11:36.822 --> 11:39.155
- Kenny: I'm good, man.
- Yeah, you are. You're great.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.116
The finals are in my hands.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.202
Right, so, lobster.
How we doing?

11:44.246 --> 11:46.621
- We're doing good, chef.
- Good.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.998
I've decided to make
a butter poached lobster

11:49.000 --> 11:51.209
with a kumquat agrodolce sauce.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.919
- Nice. Like a sweet and sour?
- Mm-hmm.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.838
Good. Work well
with a lobster, yeah?

11:54.881 --> 11:55.964
Pyet:
<i> Throughout this competition,</i>

11:56.007 --> 11:58.633
I have grown tremendously
as a chef,

11:58.635 --> 12:03.096
<i> and for this challenge,</i>
<i> I want to step outside</i>
<i> of my comfort zone</i>

12:03.140 --> 12:06.349
and showcase that
I can do more than just
native american food.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.892
If it's cooking too fast,
you just take it out.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.894
It's good.
I think it's good, chef.

12:09.938 --> 12:14.232
I'm a little nervous about
how this is gonna go,
but I have faith in myself.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.401
- So, courtney, scallops?
- Yes.

12:16.445 --> 12:17.986
Where are we going with this?
What are we thinking?

12:18.363 --> 12:22.031
So I'm making a pan seared
scallop with a ginger glaze,
sautéed radicchio,

12:22.075 --> 12:25.326
and I'm gonna do
a creamy mashed potato purée.

12:25.328 --> 12:28.371
I tried this.
Extremely bitter.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.790
Yep. So, no, that's
the radicchio lettuce.
Very bitter.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.377
- These are like squash, right?
- So they're a bit
of a no-no garnish.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.672
They sort of
look better than they taste,
those zucchini.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.885
I'm rethinking all of my life
choices at the moment.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.888
It is the finale
that is on the line.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.098
We're gonna elevate this, chef.
We're gonna elevate this.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.392
There really is
no room for error.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.144
- You got your potatoes?
- Potatoes are over here.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.145
I'm gonna take them out of there
and put them in here.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.230
Smart. Good.
Don't get them too watery, okay?

12:54.232 --> 12:58.526
- Yep.
- Okay, you got 30 more seconds.
You gotta reduce down.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.571
Can you get to the next level
presentation-wise

13:01.615 --> 13:03.072
so that you're gonna get
a spot in the finale?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.575
- Yes. Yes.
- Mariah, you're on
the top here.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.827
- How are we gonna
cook the lamb? Okay.
- I'm gonna grill it.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.121
What are you gonna do with
the peaches and the tomatoes?

13:10.165 --> 13:11.998
I'm gonna do, like, a salad.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.166
So the peaches
are gonna work with lamb,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.960
because lamb's so gamey,
it's okay with that sweetness.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.879
I'm super excited to work
with lamb.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.756
I wanna be fancy.
This is my opportunity
to be fancy.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.342
- Yes!
- People call me bougie
every once and a while,

13:22.385 --> 13:24.385
so, okay, I'll give you bougie,
and it's on my plate.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.972
<i> So there's nothing about me</i>
<i> that's bougie,</i>

13:28.058 --> 13:29.766
but I can razzle dazzle
some things.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.018
Honey and peaches, again,
big flavors always over here.

13:32.971 --> 13:34.521
All right, chefs, listen.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.105
Here comes the platform.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.192
We are sending down
some exotic plateware.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.736
Each plate comes
with a special ingredient.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.988
You gotta grab that plate,
grab that ingredient,

13:44.032 --> 13:46.199
and make this dish
a showstopper.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.952
I really, really want
to get a dark plate

13:48.995 --> 13:52.080
to contrast
with that sliced wagyu.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.414
You got only
a couple seconds left.

13:53.449 --> 13:56.918
<i> Right there</i>
<i> is a beautiful dark plate</i>

13:56.962 --> 13:58.127
with squash blossoms on it.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.379
<i> This is great.</i>

13:59.714 --> 14:02.715
There's a truffle
on that plate over there!
Oh, my god!

14:05.178 --> 14:06.511
Gordon: We have
another little surprise.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.763
Do you know how to make
these dishes stand out?

14:08.807 --> 14:11.057
Some exotic plate work, okay?

14:11.101 --> 14:13.685
- Think about the plate.
- Ooh.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.938
I locate a plate that has
a golden ingredient!

14:16.982 --> 14:18.398
<i> A black truffle.</i>

14:18.441 --> 14:20.275
- You got the truffle?
Lovely. Well done.
- Yeah.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.903
Ah! Like, this is my plate.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.906
Five, four, three, two--

14:26.908 --> 14:28.992
- what do you want?
What do you want?
- I got it.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.912
- Aah!
- Well done. My...

14:32.914 --> 14:35.498
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

14:35.542 --> 14:38.251
I'm bringing you some
exotic plateware, okay?

14:38.253 --> 14:43.214
Each of them has
an special ingredient
on these plates.

14:43.258 --> 14:47.468
- You have to pick a plate.
- Heard, chef.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.847
Down from the heavens
comes that dish that I want,
that wood.

14:50.849 --> 14:51.973
<i> And it's like</i>
<i> a tree stump plate,</i>

14:51.975 --> 14:53.558
<i> and it works perfectly</i>
<i> for my dish.</i>

14:53.602 --> 14:55.476
And it just happened to have
chanterelle mushrooms on it.

14:55.478 --> 14:59.814
Make sure it makes sense
for your dish. Good job.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.191
Reuel:
<i> I grab the carrot powder,</i>
<i> the smoke salt, and the uni.</i>

15:02.235 --> 15:04.152
I know for a fact
it's gonna slap.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.737
What'd you grab, ken?

15:05.780 --> 15:08.072
I got the wood board,
and I got some micros, chef.

15:08.116 --> 15:12.327
- Nice.
- I grabbed some uni.

15:12.370 --> 15:16.164
Yeah, some salt,
and a little bit
of carrot powder.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.250
- Great.
What plate did you grab?
- Um, meaning?

15:19.252 --> 15:23.004
- What plate did you grab
off the second drop?
- Oh.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.384
Talk to me, reuel.
What plate did you grab, chef?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.011
I did not grab a plate, chef.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.429
( no audible dialogue )

15:33.308 --> 15:35.224
( bleep )

15:39.940 --> 15:41.189
what did you grab
off your platform?

15:41.232 --> 15:43.232
I did not grab a plate, chef.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.276
You had to grab
that plate, chef.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.071
( bleep )

15:48.073 --> 15:50.490
you're gonna have your work
cut out for you, chef.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.283
Oui.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.202
I'm tired of the curveballs,
but you know what?

15:54.204 --> 15:57.330
-<i> I forgot it. </i>
- How did you do that?

15:57.374 --> 15:59.374
<i> And now I gotta use</i>
<i> what I have,</i>

15:59.417 --> 16:01.042
try to plate that
as best as possible.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.794
I'll have to figure it out.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.212
So today
it's figure it out alley.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.588
Turn it up a notch.
You all right. Come on.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.592
Best plate you ever plated
in your life, chef.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.302
You're not going home.
We're not going home.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.805
You're not going home.
Let's do this, big boy.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.014
Let's do this!

16:16.518 --> 16:17.892
Courtney, what did you get?

16:17.894 --> 16:20.895
I got some microgreens that have
a little color to them.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.063
- I have a truffle.
- Oh, my goodness me.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.982
- And then--
- look at me.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.233
That is magic. Give me a kiss.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.986
- Thank you.
- That-- that is beau--

16:27.988 --> 16:30.196
I'm speechless.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.658
- Truffle.
- I am on cloud nine.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.244
Last time I didn't use enough.
This time I know better.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.287
Truffle, there you go.
Man, truffle.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.289
I cannot believe the top floor
didn't get that.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.250
You know,
I had a moment of doubt,

16:42.252 --> 16:45.253
but now I am actually excited
about my dish.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.088
- Love the plate by the way.
- Thank you.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.756
Right. What did you get?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.216
- Pyet: The, uh-- yeah.
- Caviar.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.094
Lobster, caviar, a glass bowl.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.221
Now really start thinking
about what you're doing, okay?

16:55.265 --> 16:56.347
Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.432
I love the vibe of the dish.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.183
I'm going for this
under the sea vibe,

16:59.227 --> 17:02.103
<i> and I'm beyond excited.</i>

17:02.147 --> 17:04.272
Keep it going, okay?

17:06.151 --> 17:08.359
All right, mariah, looks like
you got the smoking dome.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.154
- Are you going to smoke
this dish under there?
- I am.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.406
I wanna do smoke because
I do a lot of grilling.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.200
<i> Smoke inspires me because</i>
<i> it brings me back to nature.</i>

17:16.202 --> 17:18.745
<i> So my plan is to put</i>
<i> the lamb on the grill</i>

17:18.788 --> 17:20.163
and get the smoking gun going

17:20.206 --> 17:23.124
<i> so I can incorporate</i>
<i> all that smoke into my dish.</i>

17:23.126 --> 17:26.753
- Richard:
Are those finger limes?
- Yes, they are.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.047
I've never used
finger limes before.
I know they're fancy.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.132
Okay. I'll show you.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.842
Yeah, so you get these things
that look like caviar.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.594
Oh! Ooh-- oh!

17:34.637 --> 17:36.012
- The little scoop of that
on top of something.
- Yeah, that's cute.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.098
- I like that.
- That could be great, okay?
So you got lime caviar.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.477
I love that. This is cute.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.763
I love the plate
you grabbed, angie.
You grabbed squash blossoms.

17:45.774 --> 17:46.981
- Are you thinking
about using them?
- Yes, chef.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.107
What is that?
What are you gonna do?

17:48.401 --> 17:51.194
I'm making a little bit
of farmer's cheese, I hope.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.863
- ( laughs )
- okay. All right.
You're going big.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.199
That's one of those things
I can edit out if I need to,

17:56.284 --> 17:58.409
but it'll be nice
if I can pull it off.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.786
You just need
one beautiful blossom stuffed.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.913
- Angie: Yeah.
- You're not opening up
a cheese shop,

18:01.956 --> 18:03.164
you're just trying to get
to the finale.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.626
So I've got the squash blossom,
and I'm hoping to really get

18:06.669 --> 18:09.045
that cheese in a blossom
and get it fried off.

18:09.047 --> 18:12.090
Damn it. I don't know
if it's gonna be any cheese
in there or not.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.591
Breathe through it.
You know what you gotta do.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.301
Angie:<i> It's causing me</i>
<i> a little bit of trouble,</i>

18:15.345 --> 18:17.178
<i> but I really feel like</i>
<i> this is gonna elevate my dish,</i>

18:17.222 --> 18:18.596
so I'm trying to get it done.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.307
All right, some of your
colleagues are down there
in the basement

18:21.351 --> 18:23.017
cooking with a wobbly pan
right now.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.936
You're up here on the top level.

18:24.979 --> 18:28.064
No excuses to not see
a restaurant quality

18:28.108 --> 18:30.775
michelin star plate tonight.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.610
Richard:<i> The margins</i>
<i> are very, very thin.</i>

18:32.654 --> 18:35.446
This is coming down to details.
It's literally about a garnish.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.783
It's about
a little sprinkle of salt,
a drizzle of sauce.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.953
<i> Can they bring it together</i>
<i> to make a beautiful plate?</i>

18:41.996 --> 18:44.122
Time's running out,
and it's tight.

18:44.165 --> 18:47.500
Over ten minutes to go,
guys, okay?

18:47.544 --> 18:49.001
Scallops, they take
three minutes to cook.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.586
- Three minutes to cook, okay?
- Yes.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.713
So don't go too fast,
otherwise they'll be rubber.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.090
That's a beautiful color
on there.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.884
Gordon:<i> Courtney's got</i>
<i> those stunning scallops,</i>

18:56.928 --> 18:59.887
<i> and pyet has</i>
<i> that beautiful lobster.</i>

18:59.931 --> 19:02.223
Two incredible dishes
that if done right

19:02.225 --> 19:03.850
<i> could definitely</i>
<i> get them into the finale.</i>

19:03.893 --> 19:05.268
Yeah, I'm about to put
these scallops in.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.937
Gotcha.
You still have seven minutes.
That's great.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.939
I feel your focus right now,
gentlemen.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.608
Let's go, guys.
Push hard.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.360
- Kenny: Let's go.
- Like you've never
pushed in your life.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.487
- Let's go.
- Cook like you want it!

19:16.531 --> 19:18.197
Heard, heard, chef!

19:18.241 --> 19:21.033
Richard: Okay, time
is running out, everyone.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.452
- Really?
- Last decisions are made now.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.122
Angie:
I need a piping bag.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.124
I don't have time to put it
in a piping bag.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.334
What's the matter?
Are you good?

19:30.378 --> 19:33.087
You got one of these
squash blossoms stuffed already?

19:33.131 --> 19:34.922
- No, chef. No.
- You don't? Okay.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.175
- Are we not gonna do that?
- I don't think
I'm gonna get it done.

19:37.218 --> 19:41.345
- Okay. All right.
- Damn it, I wish I got that
squash blossom on.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.797
In over 90 seconds from now,
we can actually start
dressing our food.

19:43.799 --> 19:47.310
- Mariah: Yes, chef.
- Tilt the pan and let
the pan do the work.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.229
- Courtney: Yes, chef.
- Three minutes, guys.

19:50.231 --> 19:54.650
Let's go.
Elevated, dazzling.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.862
It's your competition.
It's yours to win
or yours to lose.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.907
- Just let it go.
Let it be your last touch.
- Heard.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.410
Potentially two minutes away
from entering the finale.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.830
Here we go! Last two minutes.
Start plating.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.998
You gotta bring it together now.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.751
Good, pyet.
Well done, courtney.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.170
Everything needs to have
a purpose and a reason, okay?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.254
- Courtney: Yes, chef.
- Good.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.381
You need to be creative, right?

20:17.383 --> 20:20.009
- You did not grab a plate
off the second drop.
- Yes.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.887
I need texture, color,
everything in the book.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.264
<i> I have to cut fish</i>
<i> a certain way,</i>

20:25.308 --> 20:27.683
<i> elevate the roots</i>
<i> till they get high.</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:30.228
At this point in time,
it's like do or die, bro.

20:30.230 --> 20:34.232
A couple seconds now.
Final touches.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.316
No shaky hands today.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.985
Every plating aspect
is deliberate.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.741
Nyesha:
The platform's coming, guys!
Bring it home.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.327
Richard:
Does it look beautiful?
Does it look inviting?

20:46.371 --> 20:49.205
- Does it look special?
- Platform's here.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.998
Platform's here.
Let's go, bro!

20:52.961 --> 20:54.752
Go! Right now!

20:54.796 --> 20:57.296
- Six, five, four...
- Okay, baby.

20:57.340 --> 21:01.217
...Three. Let's go, guys.
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:02.387 --> 21:04.095
Reuel:
<i> I missed that plate,</i>

21:04.097 --> 21:09.058
but I put every piece of me
on that plate.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.977
I am so proud of myself.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.604
I'm happy with that.
I am. I'm happy with it.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.356
- Yeah, boy! Let's go!
- I'm happy with that.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.860
Here we go.
Ten, nine, eight,

21:19.904 --> 21:22.863
seven, six, five,

21:22.907 --> 21:27.034
four, three, two, one.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.829
It's going. It's going.
Hands off!

21:29.872 --> 21:32.581
Well done.
Oh, my goodness me.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.418
- Okay, angie, you're far away!
- Angie: Yes, sir.

21:35.461 --> 21:39.005
- 15 seconds!
The platform is here!
- Heard!

21:39.048 --> 21:40.089
- Less than 15 seconds!
- It's here!

21:40.133 --> 21:41.090
You gotta get over there, angie.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.552
Ten, nine, eight,

21:44.595 --> 21:46.846
seven, six,

21:46.889 --> 21:50.266
five, four, three,

21:50.310 --> 21:52.476
two, one.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.061
It's gone.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.855
- Good job.
- Angie: Thank you.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.065
Thank you, chef.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.115
Angie:
<i> Jesus, take the wheel.</i>

22:06.159 --> 22:08.534
This judging is gonna determine

22:08.578 --> 22:11.912
<i> the two people who go</i>
<i> straight to the finale,</i>

22:11.956 --> 22:14.248
and I'm really hoping I can be
one of those two people.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.877
We asked you to produce
a show-stopping plate.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.129
Finale-worthy!
They're fantastic.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.882
- Nyesha: Gorgeous.
- Richard: Show-stopping dishes.
It looks amazing.

22:22.884 --> 22:26.302
I just hope right now that these
taste as good as they look

22:26.346 --> 22:31.932
because two of you
will secure your spots
directly into the finale.

22:31.934 --> 22:36.145
The rest of you
will go head to head
in your final cook-off

22:36.147 --> 22:39.231
to fight for that
last remaining spot.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.651
Shall we start off
on the middle floor?

22:42.695 --> 22:46.113
So it's a butter poached lobster
laced with caviar,

22:46.115 --> 22:48.199
the kumquat gastrique,

22:48.242 --> 22:49.950
and then there's a ribbon
of a zucchini salad.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.328
Caviar and lobster? Luxury.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.621
Now, butter poaching lobster,

22:53.706 --> 22:55.581
you know there's a fine mark
on that, right?

22:55.666 --> 22:58.250
You've got
the most dangerous protein
to cook in the semifinals.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.169
If it's cooked well,
brilliant.

23:00.213 --> 23:03.255
If it's under/over,
you're in trouble.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.924
It's the hardest thing to cook.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.175
Oh, dear.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.721
Now, butter poaching lobster,

23:11.015 --> 23:12.056
you know there's a fine mark
on that, right?

23:12.767 --> 23:15.351
You've got the most
dangerous protein to cook
in the semifinals.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.261
If it's cooked well,
brilliant.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.563
It it's under/over,
you're in trouble.

23:19.607 --> 23:23.150
Oh, my gosh.
There's so much riding on
the line right now.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.318
It's the hardest thing to cook.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.946
<i> This lobster,</i>
<i> if it's not perfect,</i>

23:26.948 --> 23:28.489
I'm gonna be broken hearted.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.199
Oh, dear.

23:30.243 --> 23:33.160
And it's cooked
to utter perfection.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.917
Lobster's nailed.
Absolutely beautiful.

23:39.961 --> 23:43.587
No doubt. I think for me,
that could've used a little bit
finishing salt.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.756
Richard: The lobster, I love
that it's presented whole.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.300
The swiss chard is kinda
giving me these seaweed vibes.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.052
It's telling a story,
this dish.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.182
These are pan seared scallops,
truffled mashed potato,

23:55.268 --> 23:57.893
and on the side,
it's a radicchio lettuce.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.147
Plate choice came
with an amazing truffle.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.567
Radicchio sounded
like an odd choice,

24:04.610 --> 24:07.862
but I love how the bitterness
works with the sweet scallops.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.864
Yes, the bitterness is lovely.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.031
Just a nice little pop of acid

24:11.325 --> 24:13.909
would have just really kind of
taken this over the top.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.203
What I love about this
is that when someone's
got the confidence

24:16.247 --> 24:18.122
in the semifinal
to cook a scallop.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.124
That's a bold move, man.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.667
Scallop's cooked beautifully.

24:21.711 --> 24:22.877
Good job.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.297
<i> We've got a social media chef</i>
<i> and a home cook here,</i>

24:26.340 --> 24:29.216
<i> and their creativity</i>
<i> absolutely blew me away.</i>

24:29.218 --> 24:30.885
It oozed sophistication.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.429
- Top floor.
- We'll start over here.

24:34.974 --> 24:39.143
- Wow.
- It looks beautiful.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.770
Richard: Smoked spiced lamb
with potato purée,

24:41.814 --> 24:43.105
tomatoes, and peaches.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.565
Gordon: When you see
a dish like this passing

24:44.609 --> 24:46.108
through the dining room,
it's an eye-catcher.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.736
- Nyesha: Wow.
- I think it looks beautiful.

24:48.779 --> 24:53.699
My palate is pleasantly excited
with the notes of tanginess

24:53.743 --> 24:55.868
that I'm getting
from the brightness
of the peaches.

24:55.912 --> 25:00.122
Gordon:
The smokiness is intriguing.
So what would I change?

25:00.166 --> 25:04.960
Grill those peaches a bit more.
But it's a good dish.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.254
Over here,
wagyu beef filet mignon

25:07.298 --> 25:08.964
with mashed potatoes, bacon.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.051
The extra ingredient here
was a squash blossom

25:12.094 --> 25:14.136
that did not get used
in the final plating.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.096
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.852
Wagyu, I mean,
so good you could eat it raw.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.897
- Mm-hmm.
- Nyesha: This is very bold.

25:24.941 --> 25:29.443
The seasoning on
this wagyu filet is spot on.
Really beautiful.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.070
Wagyu cooked beautifully.
Melts in your mouth.

25:31.113 --> 25:35.157
Is it showtime?
Here's the nitpicking
semifinal moment for me.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.034
If you've got squash blossoms,

25:37.078 --> 25:39.161
which are in season
for a tiny window,

25:39.163 --> 25:41.705
I would serve that to elevate.

25:41.749 --> 25:45.125
Damn it. I should've done
everything I could

25:45.169 --> 25:46.835
to get that squash blossom
on there.

25:46.879 --> 25:50.214
<i> That may have been</i>
<i> the showstopper element</i>
<i> that I needed.</i>

25:52.009 --> 25:54.134
From the bottom floor,

25:54.178 --> 25:57.471
halibut, carrots,
potatoes, parsnips,

25:57.473 --> 25:59.181
bringing some opulence
from that second grab

25:59.225 --> 26:00.724
through an uni beurre blanc.

26:00.768 --> 26:04.353
Presentation plate
was left on the platform
unfortunately.

26:04.397 --> 26:08.315
- So no pick up on the--
- not on the plate, chef.

26:12.029 --> 26:15.239
Gordon:
Halibut's a real tough
fish to get right.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.324
That is slightly overcooked,

26:17.368 --> 26:20.202
but the sea urchin's
beautiful, creamy, sweet.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.496
Knife work,
beautifully done.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.790
It is lacking
the pièce de résistance,

26:24.834 --> 26:26.083
the plate itself though,
for sure.

26:28.296 --> 26:32.423
Next here we have an inspiration
from the forest floor.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.300
A veal chop, corn,

26:34.302 --> 26:36.969
turnips, rustic purée
on the bottom,

26:37.013 --> 26:39.597
and chanterelle mushrooms
on the second drop.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.681
This dish is proud.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.225
It's, like, literally
standing up, showing off.

26:43.227 --> 26:47.938
Corn and chanterelles,
classic combination.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.106
It's got the wow factor.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.066
The bone is presented
beautifully.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.986
This veal, delicious.
What would I change?

26:53.988 --> 26:57.906
You expose protein like that,
season it!

26:57.950 --> 26:59.033
And this chanterelle here
is undercooked.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.784
I am so nitpicking now,

27:00.828 --> 27:03.245
it's the difference between
a pair of ant's testicles.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.207
But I wanna get back in there,
'cause it's good.

27:07.251 --> 27:10.210
- Very gorgeous dish.
- All of you, well done.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.338
Give us a moment, please.

27:12.381 --> 27:16.008
Nyesha:<i> Wow, they were</i>
<i> all really fantastic dishes.</i>

27:16.052 --> 27:17.885
Every single chef cooking
in this competition,

27:17.928 --> 27:21.096
the amount of mentorship they've
had between the three of us...

27:21.098 --> 27:22.222
Let's go, baby.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.432
<i> ...Has added up to greatness,</i>

27:23.809 --> 27:25.893
and you can see it in the plates
that these chefs are cooking.

27:25.936 --> 27:29.772
Let's start off
with the ones that were missing
those greater points.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.191
There's definitely one from
my floor that's obvious, right?

27:32.234 --> 27:33.776
The halibut was lacking
depth of flavor.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.570
Richard: And I don't understand.
How is your focus not there
to grab the dish?

27:36.614 --> 27:38.822
I mean, it shows you how
unnerving this competition is.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.659
If you get
the amazing wagyu beef,
I'd expect something to be

27:41.702 --> 27:42.993
a little bit more show-stopping
than that, right?

27:43.037 --> 27:44.036
- Nyesha: Absolutely.
- Richard: Yeah.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.080
The additional ingredient,
the squash blossom,

27:46.082 --> 27:48.624
why wouldn't you use that
on a day like today?

27:48.668 --> 27:51.919
The scallop dish,
delicious, amazing flavor.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.212
There was this brilliance
in that dish

27:53.297 --> 27:55.089
with the radicchio,
but not one of my favorites.

27:55.132 --> 27:57.758
I think the truffle could've
been used better as well.

27:57.802 --> 28:01.053
To me, there are three dishes
today final-worthy,

28:01.097 --> 28:02.388
but only two spots.

28:02.390 --> 28:05.224
Lobster, caviar,
plating like that--

28:05.267 --> 28:07.768
nyesha: And the vessel choice,
oh, just stunning.

28:07.770 --> 28:08.686
I thought it literally was,

28:08.979 --> 28:10.229
like, everything
under the sea you'd want.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.272
- The lamb.
- Nyesha: The smoke came in

28:12.316 --> 28:13.941
so beautifully
on the background.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.526
The smokiness.
Grill those peaches, though.

28:15.569 --> 28:19.154
- Yes.
- The veal was
a beautifully executed dish.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.532
Nyesha: Wow.
Taking that forest floor
inspiration.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.534
I just wish they had cooked
the mushrooms properly.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.244
- Mmm.
- Man.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.413
I just hope it's enough,
you know?

28:28.874 --> 28:29.957
Let's go.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.250
Here we go, guys.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.377
We have come to a decision.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.963
This is
the most difficult decision

28:36.006 --> 28:38.382
we've had to make
in the competition so far.

28:38.384 --> 28:41.802
There were three dishes today
that really stood out.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.929
Unfortunately, only two of them

28:43.973 --> 28:49.143
can earn their way
into the finale right now.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.019
The first dish headed

28:51.063 --> 28:54.982
into the next level finale is...

28:57.069 --> 28:59.194
The lobster.

28:59.196 --> 29:02.990
- Pyet, congratulations.
- Let's go.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.992
Yeah, girl!

29:04.994 --> 29:08.203
This win means everything.

29:08.205 --> 29:11.248
Like, part of me wants
to bawl and cry,

29:11.292 --> 29:14.585
<i> and a part of me is like,</i>
<i>"keep your composure, but still</i>
<i> be very proud of yourself."</i>

29:14.587 --> 29:17.838
this is probably one of
the happiest moments of my life.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.757
It is the happiest moment
of my life.

29:21.385 --> 29:25.721
This next decision
I think has been one
of the most difficult.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.265
It came down to two dishes.

29:28.267 --> 29:32.352
The second dish
that has earned its way
into the finale...

29:34.231 --> 29:35.230
Is...

29:38.986 --> 29:39.902
The smoked lamb dish.

29:40.154 --> 29:43.781
- Oh, my god.
- Mariah, congratulations.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.991
Congratulations, girl.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.618
- Mariah: Oh, my god.
- Gordon: Well done.

29:47.661 --> 29:48.452
Thank you, chef.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.287
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

29:53.167 --> 29:55.125
It's been such a long road.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.796
<i> For them to see</i>
<i> greatness in me,</i>

29:58.839 --> 30:00.088
<i> it's an amazing feeling.</i>

30:00.132 --> 30:04.176
What I take from this
is hard work pays off.

30:04.220 --> 30:07.429
Mariah, I couldn't be
more proud of you.
You pushed yourself.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.098
You become better
and better every time
you're in that kitchen.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.934
Carry that momentum
into the finals.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.519
Thank you.

30:13.562 --> 30:18.023
Kenny, young man,

30:18.067 --> 30:19.858
that close.

30:19.902 --> 30:22.986
But you've got no reason
on that performance
to ever doubt yourself.

30:23.030 --> 30:27.324
This one came down to details.
Boy, you were close.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.243
Hard pill to swallow.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.078
<i> I gave everything I had.</i>

30:31.121 --> 30:33.872
But you know,
I gotta pick my damn head up.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.082
We gonna fight.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.961
Gordon: You all still have
an amazing chance

30:39.004 --> 30:40.879
to make it into that finale

30:40.923 --> 30:44.591
creating dishes made
with gold and silver.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.928
What I'm expecting
from you four

30:47.972 --> 30:50.055
is a quarter of
a million dollar dish.

30:50.057 --> 30:54.893
Now, since richard
and nyesha oversaw
the last two eliminations,

30:54.937 --> 30:56.854
I'll be with you tonight.

30:56.897 --> 30:59.982
They'll join join us afterwards
to decide who will join pyet

31:00.067 --> 31:02.150
and mariah in the finale.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.696
Everyone,
please head to the lift.

31:05.739 --> 31:10.075
I'll meet you in the top kitchen
minutes from now.

31:10.119 --> 31:11.243
- Good luck.
- Here we go.

31:11.287 --> 31:12.953
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.288
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.956
I am gonna give it everything.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.876
<i> They better pray hard</i>
<i> that I mess up</i>

31:18.919 --> 31:21.128
because I'm praying
even harder not to.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.973
Angie:<i> I am gonna be cooking</i>
<i> against some great chefs.</i>

31:33.017 --> 31:36.018
I don't think they fear me,
and they should.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.394
They really, really should.

31:37.438 --> 31:39.104
This is it,

31:39.148 --> 31:41.690
your last chance
for that final spot.

31:41.734 --> 31:42.774
Courtney:<i> I'm all in.</i>

31:43.068 --> 31:46.194
I'm gonna dig deep
and do what I need to do to win.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.989
There's $250,000 on the line.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.324
Line up
against the door, please.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.491
Kenny:
<i>It's no holds barred right now.</i>

31:51.827 --> 31:55.037
I don't care who you are,
I don't care how old you are,

31:55.080 --> 31:56.079
I don't care how big you are.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.874
<i> You are going down.</i>

31:58.918 --> 32:00.292
Gordon: 30 minutes.

32:01.253 --> 32:06.757
Five, four, three, two, one.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.717
And go. Go, go, go.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.677
Good luck, guys.
30 minutes.

32:10.721 --> 32:14.097
Protein on.
Get it back on your table.
Start working it out.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.642
Reuel:<i> Everybody's going</i>
<i> for that red meat.</i>

32:16.644 --> 32:20.020
For you to stand out,
what's gonna be refreshing
on the palate?

32:20.064 --> 32:22.064
<i> Something light. Fish.</i>

32:22.107 --> 32:24.274
<i> I look at that salmon</i>
<i> like "pretty woman."</i>

32:24.318 --> 32:26.276
we're gonna make her
look elegant as hell.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.362
- Mariah, what did you get?
- I got a ribeye.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.905
Gordon: A ribeye?
Beautiful, beautiful.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.532
Where are we going
with the ribeye?
What are you thinking?

32:32.534 --> 32:34.660
I'm just thinking
a pan seared ribeye.

32:34.703 --> 32:38.580
I have one more opportunity
to become a finalist.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.583
So ribeye mash, how are you
gonna elevate that?
Where's the gold going?

32:41.627 --> 32:44.962
Um, the gold?
I have not figured out where
the gold is going just yet,

32:45.005 --> 32:46.546
- but I'll get it together.
- Gotcha.

32:46.590 --> 32:50.092
I now need to be laser focused
on this steak,

32:50.094 --> 32:51.802
and make sure that it
is spectacular.

32:51.845 --> 32:55.055
- Why'd you go for the salmon?
- Uh, I'ma elevate it.

32:55.057 --> 32:58.225
You're gonna elevate it?
And then how are you gonna
incorporate that gold?

32:58.227 --> 33:00.352
That gold, I'm gonna dust
that salmon on top of it.

33:00.354 --> 33:04.356
I'm coming in
to get that last final spot.

33:04.358 --> 33:06.274
Everybody else has a heavy,
rich protein.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.861
So this fish is gonna be it.

33:09.905 --> 33:13.198
We're 19 minutes remaining.
Right, kenny, what did you grab?

33:13.242 --> 33:15.075
I got duck breast, chef.
I'm gonna do a duck breast.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.911
I'm gonna do a sherry reduction.
I'm gonna roast my veg.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.622
Super dangerous.
A lot of jeopardy in the duck.

33:20.708 --> 33:25.168
- What is it with you
taking so much risk?
- 250,000 damn dollars.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.670
I'm wanna go to my staple.
I'm wanna go to my duck.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.214
<i> That was the first dish</i>
<i> I cooked in "next level chef."</i>

33:29.258 --> 33:31.550
I wanna run it back
and I wanna get it right.

33:31.593 --> 33:33.343
Right, so you got
the filet mignon, right?

33:33.387 --> 33:35.345
Yes, chef.
I've got a filet mignon.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.222
I've got beautiful trumpets,
I've scored them.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.182
I'm gonna put a beautiful grill
on those.

33:39.226 --> 33:42.102
One spot left, okay, so focus
and taste everything, yeah?

33:42.104 --> 33:43.228
- Yes, chef.
- Well done.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.189
This is gonna be
the most perfect,

33:46.191 --> 33:48.900
<i> beautiful,</i>
<i> show-stopping plate</i>

33:48.944 --> 33:51.194
anyone has ever seen ever.

33:51.238 --> 33:54.239
15 minutes gone, and there's
15 minutes remaining.

33:54.283 --> 33:56.950
Now for one of you,
you're 15 minutes away

33:56.994 --> 33:58.577
from the final spot
in the finale.

33:58.579 --> 34:01.788
Keep it going.
They're looking fantastic.

34:01.832 --> 34:03.123
He has so much going on
over here.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.250
I'm anxious to see
how it's gonna turn out.

34:05.294 --> 34:07.127
<i> My nerves</i>
<i> are all over the place.</i>

34:07.171 --> 34:10.464
I mean, you have $250,000
riding on this bitch.

34:10.466 --> 34:13.967
You think that ( bleep )
feel comfortable? No way.

34:14.002 --> 34:16.053
Figure it out.
Figure it out, big boy.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.388
- Does anybody see ginger?
- Ginger, uh...

34:18.390 --> 34:21.725
Yes, it's--
you're near it, courtney.
Come around towards me.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.102
Oh, I'm sorry.
Garlic, garlic, garlic.
Not ginger. Garlic.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.645
I have garlic.
Here's some more garlic.

34:25.689 --> 34:26.688
- Courtney:
You have a little garlic?
- Here you go.

34:26.982 --> 34:30.067
- I think courtney's confused.
- She is. Yeah.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.652
You good. You got this.
You good.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.572
Just breathe, courtney,
like you tell us. Breathe.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.450
- Ooh, your towel!
- Pyet: Your towel's on fire.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.536
Keep it going.
They're looking fantastic.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.205
7 1/2 minutes to go.

34:44.041 --> 34:45.248
Amazing stuff.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.834
The duck, the ribeye,
the filet, the salmon.

34:47.836 --> 34:51.421
- Who's got it?
- Right now, seems like
kenny is under control.

34:51.465 --> 34:53.256
Seems like angie
has her station under control.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.133
Gordon: More importantly,
who don't you want
in that finale?

34:55.177 --> 34:56.802
- I don't want reuel. No.
- You don't want reuel? Why?

34:56.845 --> 34:59.679
Just 'cause
he's a tough competitor
for me, to be honest.

34:59.723 --> 35:00.639
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:00.891 --> 35:01.640
You don't want reuel.
You don't want...

35:02.101 --> 35:05.060
I'm gonna say angie.
I think she has secrets.

35:05.062 --> 35:06.603
Gordon: Love that.
Here we go!

35:06.647 --> 35:10.023
We've got two minutes to go!
Start plating, please!

35:10.025 --> 35:13.777
- Let's go, baby!
- Okay, where is the gold?
Where is the gold?

35:13.821 --> 35:16.238
Oh, my goodness.
She should've had the gold
at the beginning.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.073
This is the gold
and silver challenge.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.991
<i> It's gotta be on there.</i>

35:20.035 --> 35:21.743
Talk about a recipe
for disaster.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.120
<i> Yeah, that's where I am.</i>

35:23.163 --> 35:25.455
Where is the gold?
Where is the gold?

35:29.378 --> 35:33.171
We've got two minutes to go!
Start plating, please!

35:33.215 --> 35:35.632
Okay, where is the gold?
Where is the gold?

35:35.634 --> 35:37.717
I've completely forgotten
about the gold.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.803
The gold is on there.
All the gold is on there.

35:39.847 --> 35:40.971
Thank you, chef.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.974
I do the one thing
that I knew not to do,

35:44.017 --> 35:45.016
<i> grab it with my hands.</i>

35:45.060 --> 35:46.226
Come on!

35:46.562 --> 35:49.354
I have gold stuck to my fingers,
and I need to plate my dish.

35:49.356 --> 35:52.640
<i> I'm doing my damnedest</i>
<i> to get this gold onto my dish.</i>

35:52.651 --> 35:55.318
- Start getting things
on the plates.
- Gordon: 75 seconds to go.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.988
Reuel:
<i> This is a gold challenge.</i>

35:58.031 --> 35:58.989
I don't want nobody to say,
"you know what?

35:59.032 --> 36:00.198
You're a bit shy on the gold."

36:00.242 --> 36:01.867
<i> you want bling?</i>
<i> I'ma give it to you.</i>

36:01.910 --> 36:03.618
Gordon:
60 seconds!

36:03.662 --> 36:05.954
Now for all of you,
60 seconds from picking up

36:05.956 --> 36:07.205
that final spot in the finale.

36:07.249 --> 36:10.000
You have something green?
Put it on there.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.459
Gordon: Here we go. Ten...

36:11.503 --> 36:13.920
All: Nine, eight, seven,

36:13.964 --> 36:16.923
six, five, four,

36:16.967 --> 36:19.217
three, two, one.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.136
And stop. Hands in the air!
Well done!

36:22.931 --> 36:25.056
Oh, my god.

36:29.188 --> 36:31.897
Nyesha, richard, please.

36:31.899 --> 36:34.232
What an extraordinary cook.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.652
Like no other.
There's four proteins.

36:37.654 --> 36:41.948
There's a duck,
there's a filet mignon,
a ribeye, and a salmon.

36:41.992 --> 36:45.327
The duck, please,
topped with gold.

36:48.749 --> 36:52.167
Amazing contrast between sauce
and the use of gold leaf.

36:52.211 --> 36:55.128
Extremely imaginative.
Duck is cooked beautifully.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.422
Would've like to see
just a touch more salt.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.217
A gold mine of flavors here,

37:00.219 --> 37:02.928
and that sauce that works
so well with duck.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.346
It's delicious.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.306
Chef arrington says
she needed a touch more salt.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.184
I can accept that.
But what about everything else?

37:09.228 --> 37:10.185
I hope this is the winner.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.813
Next we have the filet mignon

37:13.857 --> 37:15.398
that's topped with a duck egg,

37:15.400 --> 37:18.151
and there's a stroke
of the gold.

37:22.199 --> 37:25.951
Richard:
I love this sort of play on,
like, the golden egg.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.662
That yolk
sort of becomes the sauce.

37:28.705 --> 37:31.706
This one's leaning
a little bit undercooked.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.920
The chef that made this
clearly understands
what to pair with steak.

37:36.964 --> 37:40.006
I would've loved to see
a little starch component,
crispy potatoes.

37:40.050 --> 37:42.175
I start to get
a little bit nervous

37:42.219 --> 37:44.010
<i>because I didn't grab a starch.</i>

37:44.054 --> 37:46.263
<i> But my flavors are glorious,</i>

37:46.306 --> 37:48.723
and I'm telling you,
I have the prettiest dish there.

37:48.767 --> 37:53.228
Gordon: Next, it's a ribeye
topped with 24 karat.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.984
This dish is giving me
down home feels.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.528
This dish is hugging my soul
from the inside.

38:01.571 --> 38:02.988
It's seasoned beautifully.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.949
The gold sort of feels like
a bit of an afterthought.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.784
I just wish there was
just a touch more

38:07.819 --> 38:10.787
attention to detail,
but still a very tasty dish.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.956
It's a heart of gold
in this dish.
It looks comforting.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.543
And this surprising sweet char
on the carrot...

38:16.628 --> 38:17.794
Courtney:<i> I am nervous.</i>

38:18.088 --> 38:20.046
The stakes are definitely
higher than they've ever been,

38:20.081 --> 38:24.167
<i> and everybody else</i>
<i> is stepping their game up.</i>

38:24.169 --> 38:29.180
- But I came here to win.
- This is crispy salmon
cooked skin side down.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.978
What I see in this dish
is a soul of a chef.

38:35.022 --> 38:39.733
Whoever made this
stepped outside of a standard
steak and potatoes,

38:39.776 --> 38:43.528
steak and eggs,
and really reimagined
what can be served.

38:43.572 --> 38:46.156
It kinda looks like
it's a present or it's a gift.

38:46.199 --> 38:49.909
A little pinch more of salt,
but very bold in its flavors.

38:49.995 --> 38:53.371
Tears are beating
at my eyelids.

38:53.415 --> 38:55.248
And I'm like, "nope.
You can't show anything."

38:55.250 --> 38:57.917
<i> I'm feeling like my dad</i>
<i> is with me.</i>

38:57.961 --> 39:00.837
<i> I'm literally doing this</i>
<i> competition in honor of him,</i>

39:00.839 --> 39:02.339
so I need to win.

39:02.341 --> 39:05.091
Okay, richard and nyesha,
I need to know,

39:05.093 --> 39:08.094
which protein deserves to go
into the finale?

39:08.138 --> 39:11.723
If it goes to a tie,
then I have to break that tie.

39:11.767 --> 39:16.061
My decision is based
off of brilliancy that I see,

39:16.063 --> 39:18.271
the technique in the cook.

39:19.399 --> 39:22.692
This is the hardest
cooking competition

39:22.736 --> 39:25.987
that I've ever had to judge
because every mentor

39:26.031 --> 39:28.114
<i> wants to see</i>
<i> their mentee do great.</i>

39:28.116 --> 39:30.408
I am so thankful that
this is a blind tasting,

39:30.452 --> 39:33.536
and I have no absolutely no clue
who cooked what dish.

39:35.165 --> 39:36.748
And for me,
that dish is the salmon.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.291
Gordon: The salmon.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.923
Richard blais, the protein

39:44.966 --> 39:46.800
that deserves the final spot

39:46.843 --> 39:50.220
in the finale is what, please?

39:50.263 --> 39:51.971
All four of these dishes
are delicious,

39:52.015 --> 39:53.807
<i> but this is about gold leaf.</i>

39:53.850 --> 39:56.142
That's a tough ingredient
to use.

39:56.186 --> 39:57.769
<i> Who did it the best?</i>

39:57.813 --> 39:59.187
To me, it's...

40:02.943 --> 40:04.025
It's the salmon.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.111
- Reuel.
- Wow.

40:06.154 --> 40:08.780
- Congratulations.
- Let's go!

40:08.824 --> 40:11.533
Congratulations, young man.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.123
- Come on. Come on.
- Get up. Stand up...

40:18.166 --> 40:20.166
Come here. Congratulations.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.544
Well done, okay?
Come on.

40:22.546 --> 40:24.629
Well done.

40:24.631 --> 40:29.175
It feels like
finally being acknowledged.

40:31.263 --> 40:34.889
<i> I put everything</i>
<i> in everything that I do,</i>

40:34.933 --> 40:36.516
and I feel good.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.145
Kenny, the progression
and the trajectory of your climb

40:40.188 --> 40:41.771
in this competition
is second to none.

40:41.815 --> 40:45.108
It's like a rocket
that's taken off
and no one's stopping you.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.902
You're the real deal.
Understand that.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.238
It's been a ride.
It's been a journey.

40:50.282 --> 40:53.324
I gave it everything I had,
but this ain't the end of kenny.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.953
Angie, it's been amazing
mentoring you.

40:56.997 --> 40:59.914
Your calm under pressure
is very inspiring.

40:59.916 --> 41:03.251
You absolutely
have what it takes to go
wherever you want in life.

41:03.295 --> 41:04.919
Yes, chef.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.296
I'm really upset
I don't get to cook again.

41:06.339 --> 41:09.090
I really love cooking there.

41:09.134 --> 41:13.052
But I got an experience
of a fricking lifetime

41:13.096 --> 41:16.723
and I have no regrets.

41:16.725 --> 41:18.558
Courtney, just as your mentor
from the beginning,

41:18.602 --> 41:22.061
last pick in the draft,
and the amount
that you've grown,

41:22.063 --> 41:24.856
your self-awareness,
your skill, your heart,

41:24.900 --> 41:26.399
you should be very proud
of your work.

41:26.443 --> 41:29.360
- I can't wait to see
what you accomplish.
- Thank you.

41:29.362 --> 41:32.238
It's just--
it's beyond surreal.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.240
<i> I make vision boards</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

41:34.284 --> 41:35.283
<i> This wasn't on it,</i>

41:35.619 --> 41:38.661
which tells me that
I'm not dreaming big enough.

41:38.663 --> 41:42.290
Congratulations, sweetie.
I love you so much.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.209
When you hit new york, baby...

41:44.211 --> 41:46.711
I'm so proud of you.
I love you.

41:46.755 --> 41:51.299
I wanted to take you down,
but I'm proud of you.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.344
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.054
- Love you, guys.
- Thank you.

41:56.097 --> 41:59.015
- Thank you, chef arrington.
- Thank you so much.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.229
Listen, all three of you,
congratulations.

42:04.231 --> 42:07.065
There's one test remaining,
and that's all that stands

42:07.108 --> 42:08.316
between you and a quarter
of a million dollars,

42:08.693 --> 42:14.280
a mentorship from richard blais,
nyesha arrington, and myself.

42:14.324 --> 42:18.368
I guarantee
it will be the memorable
cook of your lives.

42:18.370 --> 42:21.037
- Well done and good night.
- Wow.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.583
Get some rest.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.086
- Can I open this?
- Reuel: Is that champagne?

42:28.129 --> 42:30.922
Chef. That was good.
That was good.

42:30.966 --> 42:34.008
- Both: Salud!
- Final!

42:36.638 --> 42:38.680
Gordon:<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:38.682 --> 42:41.849
- The finalists.
- Oh, my god!
There's people all up there!

42:41.935 --> 42:45.979
One of you is about to become
the first ever next level chef.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.522
- No way!
- Let's go!

42:47.566 --> 42:49.232
- Whoo!
- This is crazy!

42:49.234 --> 42:53.611
The stress!
This is a one in a lifetime
opportunity.

42:53.613 --> 42:55.405
Gordon:
Quarter of million dollars
right there in that lamb.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.699
I want this.
I feel it in my soul.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.909
Mariah: Oh, god. Come on.
This is, like, my dream.

42:59.953 --> 43:01.119
I am gonna be
the next level chef.

43:01.121 --> 43:03.955
Gordon:
Congratulations goes to...

43:03.999 --> 43:05.164
Please pick me.
