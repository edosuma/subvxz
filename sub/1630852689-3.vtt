WEBVTT

00:24.983 --> 00:26.317
<i>Mom!</i>

01:05.065 --> 01:07.233
<i>There's a hole in the fence.</i>

01:07.317 --> 01:10.070
<i>We'll go through it and walk</i>
<i>until you find what you want.</i>

01:12.280 --> 01:16.451
<i>You're letting your fears get in your way.</i>
<i>You need to see what hell is like.</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:20.830
<i>You need to see what hell is like, Paula.</i>

02:33.028 --> 02:34.904


02:40.118 --> 02:41.327
Lights!

02:44.330 --> 02:45.498
Music!

02:45.582 --> 02:48.710


02:48.793 --> 02:50.420


03:26.581 --> 03:28.958
<i>Good evening, Son.</i>

03:32.796 --> 03:35.006
I thought you were sleeping.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.926
<i>Who can sleep with this heat?</i>

03:39.219 --> 03:42.597
That's why air conditioning exists.

03:43.223 --> 03:47.352
<i>Believe me,</i>
<i>breathing in these conditions is horrible.</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:50.980
<i>I want to hear the news.</i>
<i>How are we doing?</i>

03:51.064 --> 03:53.775
I had a lot of work.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.070
<i>You used to be more efficient.</i>

03:57.153 --> 03:58.988
Many problems.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.075
A journalist is making things difficult.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.537
<i>The press has always been</i>
<i>easily manipulated.</i>

04:09.124 --> 04:12.961
<i>And what do we do when someone</i>
<i>makes things difficult?</i>

04:14.129 --> 04:16.840
We will find a solution.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.426
<i>Long live victory!</i>

04:41.197 --> 04:43.241
The outlandish case
of the Spanish consul

04:43.324 --> 04:45.201
who chopped up and ate
a group of teenagers…

04:45.285 --> 04:46.703
CONSUL CASE
DOCTOR WON'T ANNOUNCE DIAGNOSIS

04:46.786 --> 04:49.873
…still intrigues the world media,
but one central figure in this case,

04:49.956 --> 04:53.335
<i>the renowned Dr. Schultz,</i>
<i>refuses to offer any further information.</i>

04:53.418 --> 04:56.796
<i>But how could a psychiatrist who'd spent</i>
<i>so many years with the same patient</i>

04:56.880 --> 04:59.591
never have noticed a single trace
of his psychopathic tendencies?

04:59.674 --> 05:02.719
Could it be merely a coincidence
that the consul became

05:02.802 --> 05:06.097
<i>a cannibal precisely while being treated</i>
<i>by Dr. Schultz?</i>

05:06.181 --> 05:10.810
Is being treated by this same doctor
really the best way to treat the consul?

05:10.894 --> 05:13.688
These questions are certainly
hard to answer,

05:13.772 --> 05:17.067
<i>not least of which because</i>
<i>Dr. Schultz is still refusing</i>

05:17.150 --> 05:19.778
<i>to give any interviews or statements.</i>

05:37.545 --> 05:41.216
- What the fuck! Turn that shit off!

05:41.299 --> 05:43.176
- Are you crazy?
- Me, crazy.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.845
You sleep next to a charred body,
and I'm crazy.

05:45.929 --> 05:46.930
FORENSICS

05:47.013 --> 05:49.224
- I hadn't slept a wink in two days.
- Yeah.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.644
I can tell.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.312
Well?

05:54.896 --> 05:55.897
"Well?"

05:57.065 --> 05:58.900
Have you found your girlfriend's clitoris?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.986
Goddamn it, Camila. That was uncalled for.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.489
- Did you lose your sense of humor?
- Fuck.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.953
What did you need that was so urgent?

06:10.036 --> 06:14.374
Wow, you're pissy today.
I need a little favor.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.794
- Hmm. What favor would that be?
- Look at this.

06:20.547 --> 06:24.217
I found this in the charred body
inside the car.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.177
So?

06:26.261 --> 06:28.805
So, maybe this body
doesn't belong to Lúcia.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.141
Or maybe someone hid a piercing
from her mom.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.186
- If I were Paula's son, I would have.
- But you're not, and we need to be sure.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.148
I need a DNA test on this body
done yesterday.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.442
LÚCIA 12/6/20

06:40.525 --> 06:42.527
You've already sent in a sample.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.280
No, I didn't.
I gave you a sample from this one.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.242
- But they're the same person.
- Are they?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.330
- Can you run it?
- When can I not?

06:54.873 --> 06:59.711
But it'll take, like, five days.
The lab techs make my life difficult.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.588
I need this now, and fast. It's important.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.425
More important than ID'ing
a shitload of teenagers

07:05.508 --> 07:09.012
who were locked in a fridge
by a demented asshole?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.473
Chico, let me tell you something.
Pay attention.

07:12.015 --> 07:16.269
They're dead. Now, this girl here?
She might be alive.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.064
That chance gets smaller
with every passing minute,

07:19.147 --> 07:21.900
in addition to the fact that her mother
is Paula, your boss.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.110
- Get it?
- Okay, I'll do it.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.448
- But on one condition.
- Huh?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.283
How can I make her come?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.829
She puts this in her mouth,

07:35.914 --> 07:38.291
and you… put your mouth down here.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.796
- But, Camila--
- Shut up, wise guy.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.427
Down there.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.073
Could you please stand on my back
for a bit?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.991
I'm in pain.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.162
Pain?

08:18.540 --> 08:22.335
If your world is perfect,
you shouldn't feel pain.

08:22.919 --> 08:27.882
Emotional pain is what I removed
from my world.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.052
Not physical pain.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.976
- You don't believe in my world.
- I don't believe in you.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.770
I'm sorry to hear that, Paula.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.482
You have no other choice, do you?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.528
What's the matter?

08:48.611 --> 08:51.364
I've eased your pain,
but you haven't eased mine.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.284
- I've already told you everything I know.
- And what do you know?

08:57.037 --> 09:01.249
You need to dream, Paula.
Tap into your unconscious mind, into hell.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.711
Lucas, what is there in hell?

09:05.503 --> 09:06.796
Our traumas.

09:07.464 --> 09:12.218
Hell is our traumas, but you need to go
down there to face them.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.430
- I can't do it for you.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.933
How do you deal with that?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.521
I don't know if I can stand so much pain.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.107
You can live here with me if you want.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.445
In my perfect world, Paula.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.785
Trial and error.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.829
That's how science works.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.626
I can tell you we are poised,
like the ancient explorers,

09:44.709 --> 09:47.921
before a vast territory
waiting to be conquered.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.549
But we don't have any good maps.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.886
But we're close.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.347
How close, Doctor?

09:57.430 --> 10:01.434
My research has located
the regions of the brain

10:01.518 --> 10:03.937
where our most primal emotions are born.

10:04.562 --> 10:09.317
- Empathy, fear, courage.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.194
And, as you know,

10:11.277 --> 10:16.116
everything we do in life
is stimulated by an emotion.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.284
Like you, for example.

10:19.786 --> 10:23.748
When you woke up today,
how did you feel? Happy?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.168
- Tense?

10:27.252 --> 10:30.630
Why are you tapping your fingers
on your leg?

10:36.511 --> 10:37.804
Hmm?

10:40.223 --> 10:43.601
Our emotions shape our whole body.

10:46.396 --> 10:50.483
<i>Now, imagine a brain that can activate</i>
<i>the precise regions</i>

10:50.567 --> 10:54.696
- <i>where emotions become actions.</i>

10:54.779 --> 10:58.533
<i>Has it not been proven that placebos</i>
<i>can help cure illnesses?</i>

10:59.826 --> 11:00.994
<i>Well, then.</i>

11:04.748 --> 11:06.750
What other grand actions

11:06.833 --> 11:10.337
could this perfect brain
be capable of achieving?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.592
Marques, listen to me, man.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.928
Your friend Paula's life
is in danger in there.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.974
- How do you know I'm Paula's friend?
- <i>I'm a journalist. I have my sources.</i>

11:23.058 --> 11:26.019
You have to get her out of there
as fast as possible.

11:28.855 --> 11:33.860
Schultz's clinic is one
of the most respected in America.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.238
Their reputation is good,
and they do serious research.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.992
They could help a lot of people someday.

11:41.993 --> 11:45.914
Marques, his research,
it's all a front for something terrible.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.250
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.796
I've done extensive research
on Nazis living in Brazil.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.048
I've found documents
with a shitload of info

11:55.131 --> 11:57.384
about Mengele and other German scientists.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.470
About their medical experiments in Brazil,
Marques.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.182
They experiment on people.
Real sick stuff. They're really psycho.

12:04.265 --> 12:08.269
Three other names appear in the documents.
The last name, Schultz, is one of them.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.438
I went digging, and guess what I found.

12:10.522 --> 12:11.815
In search of excellence

12:11.898 --> 12:15.235
César Schultz's dad was the right-hand man
to that Mengele fucker!

12:15.318 --> 12:18.738
<i>Look, wait for me tonight.</i>
<i>I know where you work.</i>

12:19.447 --> 12:22.951
- <i>I'll give you everything I've found.</i>
- Okay. All right.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.871
Meet me here tonight at 9:00.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.335
Paula. Paula?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.008
Beautiful, aren't they?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.469
Almost a miracle.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.555
It's a shame they only live
so few days each year.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.599
It's a privilege to see them.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.060
Today's my lucky day.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.270
Maybe it is.

13:32.354 --> 13:36.107
Dr. Schultz wants to talk to you.
Will you come with me?

13:50.830 --> 13:54.876
- I've been watching you, Paula.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.088
You seemed very curious.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.424
Training my senses.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.469
Isn't that what you taught me?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.683
And what have you been feeling?

14:11.309 --> 14:13.353
Anxiety.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.897
Sadness.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.066
Boredom.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.946
What about your dreams? How are they?

14:24.155 --> 14:26.574
I haven't remembered a single one
since I got here.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.742
Hmm.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.414
If I'm not mistaken,
you yourself told me about your dreams.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.919
About your daughter, about a large man.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.381
Those are nightmares, Doctor, not dreams.

14:43.466 --> 14:47.053
Scientifically speaking, dreams
and nightmares come from the same place.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.308
Nightmares are just anxiety.
Nothing interests me.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.228
Yes, nightmares are harmless.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.815
- But some merit our attention.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.567
Which ones?

15:00.650 --> 15:05.071
Those that… become our reality.

16:04.547 --> 16:08.134
I believe in you and in your dreams,
Paula.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.929
I've already told you that.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.057
Believe me or don't,
but they'll keep hounding me.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.310
Yes, that's why we need to study them.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.023
But I need your consent to do that.

16:23.692 --> 16:27.612
To study my head?
I'm already here, aren't I?

16:30.448 --> 16:34.869
Consent to monitor how your brain acts

16:35.578 --> 16:37.288
while you sleep.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.582
Will you let me?

16:44.254 --> 16:46.089
If I can leave this place afterwards.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.973
That also depends on how you deal
with your daughter's departure.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.308
I just want to know the truth.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.185
Paula.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.986
Tragedies happen…

17:11.781 --> 17:15.744
and sometimes our brain invents ways
to escape the pain.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.708
We need to accept the pain.

17:21.791 --> 17:25.545
We need to face reality so we don't
become trapped in an illusory world.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.593
How odd of you to say that.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.473
Your patient, Lucas,
says exactly the opposite.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.101
He denies reality completely.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.856
When he could no longer bear it,
he just closed his eyes.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.108
He built a perfect world and ran there.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.234
Yes.

17:50.612 --> 17:54.657
Sooner or later, he'll learn that closing
his eyes won't quiet the screaming.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.914
- What screaming?

18:02.832 --> 18:05.960
The screaming. It's what brought him here.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.757
- He didn't tell you?
- No.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.634
Oh.

18:15.261 --> 18:19.516
Maybe the next time you… meet.

18:47.043 --> 18:51.548
I assure you that monitoring your dreams
will only ever be good for you.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.091
Anything else, Doctor?

18:54.467 --> 18:58.471
She assaulted one of our men.
I saw. I was there.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.975
She's committed. Kinda cuckoo.

19:02.058 --> 19:05.228
- You have to be patient.
- But does it need to be at this clinic?

19:06.229 --> 19:10.358
There's that whole thing with Almeida.
The press is at the door every day.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.862
She lost her daughter, Inspector.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.366
But what do you have in mind?

19:19.367 --> 19:21.119
Bring her somewhere closer.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.998
She needs to be near
the people she cares for.

19:25.749 --> 19:30.378
I-- I know what she needs now. Trust me.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.882
Marques,

19:33.965 --> 19:38.762
Paula's transfer would need to be approved
by the DA in charge of the assault case.

19:38.845 --> 19:43.224
And that paperwork alone could take longer
than the time she should stay committed.

19:43.308 --> 19:46.186
You know how it is. This is Brazil.
There's a shitload of bureaucracy.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.816
But let me see what I can do.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.070
All right.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.490
Thanks, Inspector.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.384
- Hey!

20:19.177 --> 20:20.261
Hi, Camila.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.555
Where did you get this?

20:24.724 --> 20:28.019
Paula gave it to me.
She asked me to look into it.

20:28.978 --> 20:33.525
I dunno. This guy could be a trucker,
a born-again religious guy, who knows?

20:33.608 --> 20:35.276
This photo doesn't tell me anything.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.031
But it's still the last photo
I have of my daughter.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.576
When was the last time you saw Lúcia?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.204
A week ago.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.165
- Did she have a piercing?
- A piercing?

20:50.208 --> 20:53.003
- Where?
- Her eyebrow.

20:54.504 --> 20:58.133
No. No way at all. Why?

20:59.300 --> 21:02.929
We found a piercing in the charred body
that supposedly belongs to Lúcia.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.391
- What do you mean, "supposedly," Camila?
- Listen.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.436
Are you overworked, or is that little pen
making you retarded?

21:09.519 --> 21:11.771
- Who's the dude?
- What do you mean "retarded," twerp?

21:11.855 --> 21:13.815
- Are you crazy?
- No, not me. But you are.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.735
You mixed up evidence
from the Lúcia and Almeida cases.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.070
I looked like an idiot
in front of the lab guys.

21:19.154 --> 21:23.116
Chico, I've never mixed up case evidence
in over ten years at the morgue.

21:23.199 --> 21:27.287
- Why would something like that happen now?
- Well, the DNA sample you asked me for.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.330
- From the charred body.
- I dunno.

21:29.414 --> 21:32.083
- Are you sure it's from the charred body?
- I'm sure, Chico.

21:32.167 --> 21:35.462
Well, that sample had already been ID'd
in the Almeida case.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.133
So the body and the arm
aren't from the same person.

21:40.759 --> 21:41.843
Not in this case, no.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.979
So Paula's right.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.871
- Father!

22:13.667 --> 22:15.043
Yo, Father!

22:17.337 --> 22:18.463
Rafael.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.591
- Is everything okay?
- Hello, Father.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.593
I need your help.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.390
I've already told you, son,

22:28.473 --> 22:31.643
I know more about God's teachings
than about recovering from addiction.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.645
No, I'm not using. I'm clean.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.065
Come.

22:43.697 --> 22:45.240
This symbol and these words.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.118
Are they from any church you know of?
Any group?

22:48.201 --> 22:51.287
"Those who follow the path of justice

22:51.371 --> 22:55.041
shall find peace
and be fully rested in death."

22:55.834 --> 22:56.918
What is this, Father?

22:57.711 --> 23:00.922
Isaiah, 57:2. Old Testament.

23:01.715 --> 23:04.884
Okay, and what kind of man
wears these words on his jacket?

23:05.719 --> 23:08.471
It's the psalm that talks about people
who do good deeds

23:08.555 --> 23:10.890
and find the light,
even if that means in heaven.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.894
I don't think this man
is a good person at all, Father.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.396
And I need to find him.

23:18.356 --> 23:22.277
Some cemeteries use
certain psalms as mottoes.

23:23.153 --> 23:25.363
They even embroider them
on their uniforms.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.032
Lend me your phone.

23:31.911 --> 23:36.207
Look. It's a bit far,
but at least it's something.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.500
WHITE MIST CITY CEMETERY

23:37.584 --> 23:40.128
"THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE PATH
OF JUSTICE SHALL FIND PEACE

23:40.211 --> 23:42.547
AND BE FULLY RESTED IN DEATH."
PSALMS OF ISAIAH, 57:2.

24:17.332 --> 24:21.211
I want to get out of here! Help!

24:37.727 --> 24:40.605
CAMILA - IT'S NOT LÚCIA'S BODY

25:55.305 --> 25:57.307
What are you looking for?

26:02.479 --> 26:03.563
This?

26:07.108 --> 26:08.360
Or this?

26:18.370 --> 26:20.497
I'm rich, damn it! I have money!

26:23.041 --> 26:26.628
What's the meaning of this?
What are you doing?

26:26.711 --> 26:29.172
Stop, man! Don't do this, for God's sake!

26:33.468 --> 26:36.429
I'm gonna blow your mind.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.392
- In the name of science.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.415
Hey, Marques. Still working?

27:04.749 --> 27:07.293
Get some rest, young man. Relax.

27:09.838 --> 27:10.964
Good night.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.105


29:04.869 --> 29:06.287
<i>Mom!</i>

29:07.956 --> 29:11.292
<i>Mom! Mom, help me!</i>

30:13.730 --> 30:16.566
Lúcia! Lúcia!

30:16.649 --> 30:18.401
Lúcia!

30:20.445 --> 30:22.614
Lúcia! Lúcia!

30:25.784 --> 30:27.494
Lúcia! Lúcia!

30:32.082 --> 30:34.292
Stay calm, okay? Shh. Calm down.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.294
Hey! Here, Mom. Quick.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.310
No. No.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.146
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:55.230 --> 30:58.942
No, Lúcia! No, Lúcia! Where's Lúcia?

30:59.025 --> 31:01.361
No, no, no, no!

31:01.444 --> 31:03.363
No, no, no!

31:13.623 --> 31:16.209
No, no, no!

31:24.426 --> 31:28.555
- Calm down, calm down, calm down.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.140
Calm down.
