NARRATOR: <i>Previously on</i> Boston Legal...

00:02.794 --> 00:04.587
-What's going on?
-I'm afraid of clowns.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.047
-(nose squeaking)
-What's going on?

00:06.131 --> 00:07.757
-He's afraid of clowns.
-I am not.

00:07.841 --> 00:11.219
-Shirley's the one for me, Alan.
-I don't think it's working out.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.138
-What isn't working out?
-Us.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.015
Whatever you need, Shirley. A shoulder,

00:15.098 --> 00:17.017
-a hug, an erection.
-(groans)

00:17.100 --> 00:18.268
Melvin Palmer. How are you?

00:18.351 --> 00:20.645
You're not gonna be cheerful
about all this, are you?

00:20.729 --> 00:22.897
You know, I have been told
to keep my exuberance down

00:22.981 --> 00:24.649
until people have had
their mornin' coffee.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.068
And you, Mr. Shore,
you're a hoot, that's what.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.862
-You know what you are?
-A hoot.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.905
With a capital "H." That's what you are.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.180
-I say we just leave.
-We can't just leave.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.640
He's doing this on purpose,
not arriving on time. This is--

00:57.724 --> 00:59.267
Don't let him get to you.

01:06.566 --> 01:10.028
Your Honor, given that the defendant's
lawyer has failed to so much as appear,

01:10.111 --> 01:13.364
I ask the court to summarily direct
a verdict for the plaintiff,

01:13.448 --> 01:16.076
and order Worldwide Pictures
to pay damages in the amount--

01:16.159 --> 01:18.078
Sorry, I'm late, Judge. Big Dig traffic.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.330
I need a hovercraft. That's what I need.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.248
Hey, Al. How we doin', sunshine?

01:22.332 --> 01:25.543
JUDGE FUDD: Mr. Palmer, the court
has repeatedly directed you

01:25.627 --> 01:29.255
not to refer to the stenographer
as "sunshine."

01:29.339 --> 01:32.801
Well, maybe she should stop brightening
everybody's day with that smile of hers.

01:32.884 --> 01:33.802
That's what she should do.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.804
JUDGE FUDD: Mr. Palmer, for the last time

01:35.887 --> 01:39.349
I will ask you,
please stop wasting the court's time.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.476
Perhaps you should tell him he's a hoot.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.520
No, that's what you are,
with a capital "H."

01:43.603 --> 01:47.941
Judge, as for your time, it was my hope
to settle this little dispute.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.692
-But my good friend Al...
-I am--

01:49.776 --> 01:51.903
...over here refused to even meet with me.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.864
-That's what he did. Hence--
-Yes, because I've suffered

01:54.948 --> 01:57.450
the stench and revulsion
of meeting with you before.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.576
And for the record,

01:58.660 --> 02:01.830
the idea of your friendship
makes me want to throw up.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.666
Looks like somebody's
got a bug up. Am I right?

02:04.749 --> 02:06.417
-Jerry, gimme a pop, my man.
-(Jerry popping)

02:06.501 --> 02:07.418
Tell you what, Judge.

02:07.502 --> 02:12.382
My goal was to give Mr. Beckham here
some money, heaps of it, truth be told.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.885
But Mr. Bug Up His Snoot
refused all offers, and--

02:15.969 --> 02:17.887
My client's daughter was murdered

02:17.971 --> 02:20.932
as a direct result
of your client's conduct.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.768
Money is not about to make him whole.
Nor will it have any--

02:23.852 --> 02:26.563
But money is what lawsuits are about.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.065
Al, am I right?
Jerry, two pops for a "yes."

02:29.149 --> 02:30.942
-(Jerry pops twice)
-This case could have settled, Judge,

02:31.025 --> 02:33.111
should have settled, would have settled,

02:33.194 --> 02:37.323
but Mr. Tongue Flapper here
likes to get on his soapbox.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.324
That's what he does.

02:38.408 --> 02:42.996
Your time is being wasted here, I agree,
but not by yours truly.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.249
My client has the right to sue
the party who wronged him.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.001
That's why we're here.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.920
And as for what lawsuits
are about, Mr. Palmer--

02:51.004 --> 02:52.547
Flap, flap, flap.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.340
Only man I know who can fire up

02:54.424 --> 02:57.177
and shoot a breeze at the same time,
you big hoot, you.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.804
Put a button on it for me, Jerry.
Bring it home.

02:59.888 --> 03:00.722
(popping)

03:02.223 --> 03:06.060
(theme music playing)

03:06.144 --> 03:07.770
<i>♪ Uh-huh ♪</i>

03:10.440 --> 03:11.566

03:32.378 --> 03:33.963
So, are you two getting serious?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.715
Not serious--
Look, we just started dating, Shirley.

03:35.798 --> 03:36.633
You're having sex?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.968
I-I don't think that's really a discussion
we need to have. Do you?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.679
-Uh, I'll have it.
-(Shirley gasps)

03:41.763 --> 03:43.640
-Oh, my God!
-My God.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.227
You look exactly the same.
It's so good to see you.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.729
-Another old boyfriend?
-The oldest.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.732
I can't believe it. What has it been?
Thirty, 40 years?

03:52.815 --> 03:54.275
Oh, I don't know. Something like that.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.862
I-I actually came
'cause I could use your help, Shirl.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.699
I've gotten myself
into a little bit of trouble.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.371
-Tell me.
-Uh, well--

04:06.454 --> 04:10.833
(clears throat) Things haven't been
going exactly well for me lately.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.963
And by "lately," I should say
since the war, the one in Vietnam.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.090
I heard you hit a rough patch.

04:17.173 --> 04:21.594
Yeah, well, had my good times,
bad times like most folks.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.390
At least I managed to stay
out of jail, by God... (chuckles)

04:25.473 --> 04:27.976
...till, uh, maybe now.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.895
-What happened?
-Well, I--

04:30.979 --> 04:34.107
Police arrested me for... (chuckles)

04:35.566 --> 04:36.859
Seems I ate a seal.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.282
-You-you ate a seal?
-Well, I'm a fisherman.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.825
You know me. It's in my blood.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.035
Problem is, I'm a lousy fisherman.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.955
And, well... (clears throat)
see, what happens is,

04:49.038 --> 04:53.459
I go two, three hours without a nibble,
and then I pick up my double-aught,

04:53.543 --> 04:56.254
and I just, boom, shoot myself a seal!

04:56.337 --> 04:59.007
I mean, they're good eatin'.
They-they really are.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.591
Plus... (sighs)

05:01.342 --> 05:03.636
...cupboard's a little bare,
truth be told.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.974
You're under the impression
they want actual jail time here?

05:09.726 --> 05:11.853
Shot more than one. (chuckles)

05:14.355 --> 05:15.565
They're very good eating.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.031
He served in Vietnam,
forgoing college when he got home.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.326
I'd heard that he fell on hard times,
but I--

05:26.576 --> 05:27.994
I hadn't really kept in touch.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.705
-How many seals are we talking about?
-I don't know.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.041
I'm not sure he's altogether sound.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.878
He thinks Ashcroft Trojan-horsed
the public defender's office.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.797
-Denny.
-Shirley. Carl.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.508
Denny, I'm-I'm feeling a draft.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.635
-Do you not feel it?
-Let me tell you something.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.264
If we had a draft, we'd put a real surge
on those terrorists in Baghdad,

05:48.348 --> 05:50.183
and we wouldn't have to fight
this war with mercenaries.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.769
At a fraction of the cost.
You can quote me on that.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.980
-How's it going?
-Hm.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.608
What?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.234
Ah, I'll bet you think

06:00.318 --> 06:01.861
I don't know that I'm walking
around in my boxers.

06:01.944 --> 06:05.114
For your information,
I know full well I'm not wearing pants.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.616
Here I was underestimating you.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.784
I spilled something on 'em.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.079
Choice was to go around
looking incontinent or eccentric.

06:11.162 --> 06:11.996
Which would you choose?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.998
You might choose
not to walk around at all.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.126
-Just a thought.
-Sit on my own in my room?

06:17.543 --> 06:19.087
Life's a cabaret, man.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.802
He is getting worse, you do realize that.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.554
I'll talk to him.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.861
<i>And I wanna spend</i>
<i>the rest of my life with you, Jody.</i>

06:46.030 --> 06:46.948
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

06:47.031 --> 06:48.199
AUDIENCE (on TV): <i>Awww!</i>

06:50.284 --> 06:52.787
JODY: <i>Steve, I don't know what to say.</i>

06:54.247 --> 06:55.373
<i>We broke up.</i>

06:55.998 --> 06:58.543
<i>It's the reason why I'm on this program.</i>

06:58.626 --> 07:00.962
<i>I-I'm trying to move on with my life.</i>

07:01.045 --> 07:04.507
<i>I know, and I want</i>
<i>to start over, you and me.</i>

07:06.217 --> 07:07.635
<i>I can't marry you, Steve.</i>

07:10.096 --> 07:13.391
<i>It's time for me to move on.</i>
<i>I-I've told you this. I--</i>

07:15.059 --> 07:16.853
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

07:18.604 --> 07:20.064
(blowing nose loudly)

07:24.444 --> 07:26.779
Mr. Beckham, that was your daughter
on the talk show?

07:26.863 --> 07:30.366
Yes. She'd been somehow convinced
by the show's producers

07:30.450 --> 07:33.202
to go on and discuss
her relationship problems

07:33.911 --> 07:36.080
in front of a national
television audience.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.624
-And Steve was her boyfriend.
-Ex-boyfriend.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.209
And, as you can tell,

07:40.293 --> 07:43.212
she was totally unprepared
for a marriage proposal.

07:43.963 --> 07:48.217
And what happened
after the taping of this program?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.928
After the airing of the program,

07:51.512 --> 07:55.641
Steve went to my daughter's apartment,
and he murdered her.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.644
He stabbed her 16 times.

08:00.813 --> 08:05.109
Sir, to your knowledge,
did Steve have any history of violence?

08:05.193 --> 08:08.154
Yes. He'd been physically abusive
to Jody many times.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.323
That was the primary cause
of their breakup.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.575
On two occasions,

08:12.658 --> 08:16.162
Jody called the police
because he got physical with her,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.998
which she told the television producers.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.919
First of all, it should be said,

08:23.586 --> 08:26.714
my heart goes completely out to you.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.258
It also probably should be said
there's no mileage on that heart,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.135
so, in effect, you'd be getting a new one.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.428
Mr. Shore--

08:32.512 --> 08:34.138
He's a quipster. That's what he is.

08:34.555 --> 08:39.227
Sir, your daughter knew this young man
better than Dr. Ray

08:39.310 --> 08:43.105
or any of the television producers
over at Worldwide Pictures.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.441
-Am I right about that?
-Probably.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.570
And after this television program
was taped and aired,

08:49.654 --> 08:54.116
did she have reason to believe
this young man might endanger her life?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.661
Well, I don't know. (exhales)

08:56.744 --> 08:59.705
Well, never called the police
to say she was in fear.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.290
Did she call you?

09:01.666 --> 09:04.544
She said that she was worried
about how he might react.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.837
-She told me that.
-Did you do anything?

09:10.174 --> 09:14.136
I mean, if a father
thought his daughter was in danger,

09:14.220 --> 09:17.014
I assume he'd take steps.
That's what I assume.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.016
What did you do?

09:20.810 --> 09:24.355
The fact is, no reasonable person
would have seen this comin'.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.232
Right, Mr. Beckham?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.234
Not your daughter,

09:29.026 --> 09:32.738
not you... nobody.

09:41.455 --> 09:45.001
So, I spoke to the US Attorney
handling the matter--

09:45.084 --> 09:47.920
-And?
-And you've been arrested nine times.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.466
Each time you promise not to do it again,
and then, boom, there goes another seal.

09:52.883 --> 09:53.884
I'm trying to quit.

09:56.053 --> 10:01.517
Ethan, I-I'm going to say this
as your lawyer and your friend.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.979
I-I don't think you're entirely stable.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.815
Is anybody?

10:08.774 --> 10:12.069
Have you thought of seeing a doctor
to get any help?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.613
Oh! I have no insurance.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.573
How can that be? You're a veteran.

10:15.656 --> 10:19.118
All right, there's over two million of us
without insurance, Shirl.

10:19.201 --> 10:22.079
I mean, George, our fearless leader,
he cut enrollment

10:22.163 --> 10:26.042
for, uh, veterans earning
more than $28,000, for some families.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.671
When was the last time you saw a doctor?

10:32.214 --> 10:33.049
Three years ago.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.551
I was diagnosed as bipolar,

10:36.052 --> 10:38.220
likely suffer from post-traumatic stress.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.431
Was put on lithium, which helped,

10:40.765 --> 10:46.187
uh, but since my insurance lapsed,
I haven't taken anything

10:46.270 --> 10:47.605
for, you know, a few years.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.232
But I'm still charming.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.404
I'd like to go
with the diminished capacity defense.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.615
No! I'm not crazy.

10:57.698 --> 11:01.035
I mean, I have my issues,
but I am not insane.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.162
I needed to eat.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.457
You know what would be crazy?
(clears throat)

11:06.540 --> 11:10.544
What would be crazy is
if I just let myself starve to death.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.762
It's not that I can't handle defeat,
but if I lose to Melvin Palmer--

11:19.845 --> 11:22.932
-Have you ever lost to him?
-No.

11:23.808 --> 11:28.771
But no matter how hard I smack him down,
he just keeps getting back up again.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.983
He reminds me of this inflatable Bobo doll
I had as a kid.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.528
I'd knock it down,
and it would come back up smiling.

11:35.611 --> 11:39.031
I hated that Bobo doll,

11:39.115 --> 11:41.742
the way it just kept
popping back up, mocking me.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.035
One day I finally...

11:44.745 --> 11:45.705
stabbed it.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.834
-You stabbed your Bobo doll?
-Yeah.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.545
I murdered several of my toys.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.340
-Is that bad?
-Well...

11:57.508 --> 12:00.302
I sank some boats in a lake,

12:01.137 --> 12:02.346
buried a truck.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.475
I abandoned Mr. Machine in a park.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.894
Did you have any stuffed animals?

12:10.980 --> 12:14.024
I only had one, a teddy bear,
when I was very young.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.403
-Did you kill him?
-(laughing) No, of course not.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.578
We did part on bad terms.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.372
He would always judge me in such a...

12:29.832 --> 12:33.919
I donated him
to one of those used toy banks.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.719
-What?
-(mouths)

12:43.053 --> 12:44.096
(Denny grunting)

12:49.643 --> 12:51.645
-What are you doing?
-Boxing.

12:52.354 --> 12:56.108
Interactive video. (grunting)

12:56.192 --> 12:58.152
Um, Denny, the-the game's not on.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.236
I'm in training.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.323
I can never beat the black guy.
I gotta be ready.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.033
-Oy.
-What?

13:04.992 --> 13:07.036
Oh, it just sounded
a little racist, that's all.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.954
Oh, please, I'm not racist. It's the game.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.040
At the easy levels,
they give you a scrawny white guy.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.126
At the more difficult levels,
big, black killer thug

13:14.210 --> 13:15.961
or a Muslim terrorist.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.881
Denny, do you wanna grab dinner sometime?

13:19.715 --> 13:21.467
-Why?
-Well, nothing.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.843
I just thought we'd catch up a little.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.846
-What's the catch?
-There's no catch. It's--

13:25.930 --> 13:27.765
Well, actually,
it's my New Year's resolution,

13:27.848 --> 13:30.059
try to reconnect with people I care about.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.561
And since I care about you--
Just yea or nay.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.313
-Yea.
-Great.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.524
And, um, if you think of it, wear pants.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.111
She loves me. I knew it.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.295
There was no indication anywhere
that this young man could be homicidal.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.006
Well, let's be fair now.
He had been violent.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.133
But he never endangered anybody's life.

14:03.217 --> 14:07.179
Plus, Miss Beckham had been warned
that these tapings were often volatile,

14:07.263 --> 14:11.058
that they evoked strong
emotional responses from guests.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.351
She signed a waiver.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.646
MELVIN: Did she know that you
planned to bring her ex-boyfriend on?

14:15.729 --> 14:18.399
-She was told that we may.
-Huh.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.192
But this was a staple of our program.

14:20.276 --> 14:23.821
We were always bringing the exes on,
the abusive fathers.

14:23.904 --> 14:28.075
This is what <i>Dr. Ray</i> is all about,
cathartic confrontation.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.910
Now, when you told her

14:29.994 --> 14:34.123
that you were gonna bring on
her ex-boyfriend, did-did she object?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.876
No. Absolutely not.

14:37.376 --> 14:40.087
So she assumed the risk of being murdered.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.047
-That's a cheap shot.
-Oh, come on.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.759
Mr. Hamilton, the staple of your program,
as you readily admit,

14:45.843 --> 14:49.638
is to inflame, to stir up
cathartic confrontation.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.849
Here you had a volatile ex-boyfriend

14:51.932 --> 14:55.603
who had a history
of abuse and physical violence--

14:55.686 --> 14:57.771
She's the person that knew him best,
and never once--

14:57.855 --> 15:01.483
And you were more than tickled
to exploit her bad judgment.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.069
By the way, how many times have you rerun

15:04.153 --> 15:06.280
that particular episode
where he proposed marriage?

15:06.363 --> 15:07.823
The one that led to her murder?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.535
-I don't know.
-My count is three,

15:11.619 --> 15:13.579
including once after he killed her.

15:13.662 --> 15:17.791
Whenever something bad happens,
we all feel a need to blame somebody.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.627
Hell, I do it. You do it.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.921
-We all do--
-I move that this man be sanctioned

15:22.004 --> 15:22.922
-for continuing--
-Sanctioned?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.257
-Hoo-wee, that bug's gone deeper up.
-(popping)

15:25.341 --> 15:27.509
A deliberate attempt to blunt
questions, distract the jury.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.386
MELVIN: We need an exterminator
before it gets to his brain.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.680
Willful, illegal-- Shut up, you Bobo-head!

15:31.764 --> 15:32.598
(pops)

15:37.019 --> 15:39.063
-You called him that in open court?
-It's like he--

15:39.146 --> 15:41.649
I seem to regress to a child when...

15:42.942 --> 15:46.278
Denny, did you ever murder
any of your toys as a child?

15:46.362 --> 15:49.698
I shot my flat-screen Super Sunday.

15:50.324 --> 15:55.120
No, but growing up, did you ever
visit your toys with violence?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.748
Well, my war toys, I'd blow them up.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.792
And some of my sister's dolls,

15:59.875 --> 16:02.252
I'd twist their heads off
after I finished, um...

16:03.462 --> 16:05.297
you know, touching them, and...

16:06.465 --> 16:07.591
Why are you looking at me like that?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.636
Why is everybody looking at me
funny these days?

16:10.719 --> 16:13.681
-What are you doing with the onion?
-Oh.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.350
Well, I'm having dinner with Shirley.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.478
-I plan to cry.
-Sorry?

16:19.561 --> 16:21.438
Well, I remember when she first
fell in love with me.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.564
She thought I was vulnerable.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.984
So tonight, I plan to cry.

16:25.067 --> 16:29.196
Like, uh, Robert Frost said,
"No tears for the writer, no sex."

16:29.279 --> 16:32.783
He said, "No tears for the writer,
no tears for the reader."

16:32.866 --> 16:34.535
Whatever. I'll pull a Muskie.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.620
It worked for Hillary for about a week.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.958
Only problem is,
I can't cry without an onion.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.169
Tear ducts are all shot.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.590
We'd gotten reports
some old guy was shootin' seals.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.342
We went down to the pier, and we saw him.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.094
-In the Boston Harbor?
-Yeah,

16:52.177 --> 16:56.640
in this five-foot, rickety old skiff,
with a fishing rod and a shotgun.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.350
Did you ever actually see him
shoot a seal?

16:59.268 --> 17:00.519
On more than one occasion.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.980
He told you he was fishing
in order to eat?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.774
Yes, but the Marine Mammal Protection Act

17:05.858 --> 17:11.530
expressly makes seals a protected species,
which we informed him of many, many times.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.490
I saw in your police report,

17:13.574 --> 17:15.743
you made mention
of my client's mental status.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.662
-OFFICER: Yes.
-Do you remember what you said?

17:19.997 --> 17:22.041
I said, he appeared mentally unbalanced.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.669
-You deliberately defied me.
-No, I did not.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.629
I asked you not to make it about that,

17:27.713 --> 17:28.922
-and you did.
-No.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.217
I was just laying the groundwork
to negate mental intent,

17:32.301 --> 17:33.969
which is one element of this crime.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.139
-I don't want to be called crazy.
-I'm not doing that.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.225
Yes, you are! I am a war hero.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.772
I earned the right to be proud.
I am not a victim! I am not a victim.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.359
I don't need anybody feeling sorry for me.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.157
-Okay. I hear you.
-All right.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.826
Now, you need to hear me.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.121
You must let me fight this case
on the elements,

18:01.205 --> 18:03.749
one element being mental intent.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.418
Otherwise, you're looking at prison.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.069
Denny, do you know what...

18:35.823 --> 18:37.658
-I'm afraid to even ask.
-Keep a secret?

18:39.451 --> 18:41.829
This water pack goes in my pocket.
I hit this remote,

18:41.912 --> 18:44.540
the water goes through the tubes,
into the wires...

18:46.250 --> 18:47.251
tears.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.712
-And the point is?
-To show I'm vulnerable.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.757
I need to impress Shirley
with my sensitivity.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.092
Tip her off, and you're fired.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.302
Well, might the desired effect

18:57.386 --> 19:00.639
be blunted by the sight of all
that technology on your cheeks?

19:00.722 --> 19:04.143
Ah, we'll cover it with makeup.
And if my face is swollen,

19:04.226 --> 19:05.477
I'll tell her I've been drinking.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.729
Denny, this is preposterous even for you.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.357
This is grounds for the rubber room even.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.733
Gosh, Carl.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.863
-That hurts my feelings.
-(device beeps)

19:34.298 --> 19:36.049
MELVIN: Know what I love
about the human spirit?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.177
Our compassion.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.848
Our capacity to feel sorry
for those in pain.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.517
Hell, we had a case last year.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.354
A woman sued a department store
because she tripped over a toddler.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.398
Jury handed her a six-figure verdict.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.150
Never mind the fact

19:53.233 --> 19:56.486
that the toddler she tripped over
was her own child.

19:56.570 --> 20:02.659
I kid you not. Juries can get nutty
with compassion sometimes.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.537
That man lost his daughter.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.497
Now you wouldn't be human

20:07.581 --> 20:11.126
if you didn't wanna lessen his pain
any way you could.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.878
But let's be fair.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.380
No one could have predicted this,

20:15.714 --> 20:18.258
not even the victim,
the one who knew him best.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.135
And by the way, she was the one

20:20.219 --> 20:23.847
who rejected his proposal
on national television.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.683
She could have said,
"Let's talk about this later,"

20:26.767 --> 20:30.103
but she chose to turn him down
with cameras rolling.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.147
And even after it all went wrong,

20:32.231 --> 20:35.108
she never said to the police
or-or even to her own father,

20:35.192 --> 20:38.487
"Hey, I think he's a risk to my safety."

20:38.570 --> 20:41.865
Why? She couldn't predict that.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.160
Neither could my client.

20:46.245 --> 20:51.667
As much as you feel for this man,

20:52.292 --> 20:53.585
and you all should.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.672
He lost his little girl.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.968
Cry for him, pray for him,

21:02.261 --> 21:05.347
but don't get nutty.

21:21.238 --> 21:26.034
I remember the movie <i>Network,</i>
by Paddy Chayefsky.

21:26.118 --> 21:30.247
It depicted the extremes and perversities

21:30.330 --> 21:33.875
that television would resort to
for the sake of ratings.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.712
It was a film way ahead of its time,

21:36.795 --> 21:38.672
and yet now it seems dated,

21:38.755 --> 21:41.425
given the depths
to which television has sunk.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.303
I doubt even Chayefsky
could ever have imagined

21:44.386 --> 21:48.390
putting contestants on a program
to eat worms or raw animal parts,

21:48.473 --> 21:52.686
or women humiliating themselves,
uh, to marry fake millionaires.

21:52.769 --> 21:56.231
One network made a deal for OJ Simpson

21:56.315 --> 22:00.444
to do a prime-time special
on how he might have killed his ex-wife.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.697
Television is a noble beast, isn't it?

22:04.156 --> 22:06.158
Well, the shame is, it once was.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.537
And to many, it still should be.
Television took us to the moon.

22:10.620 --> 22:16.084
It let us cry together as a nation
when a beloved president was assassinated.

22:16.168 --> 22:20.172
Its unflinching and comprehensive
coverage in Vietnam

22:20.255 --> 22:22.090
served to end that war.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.259
Television gave us Edward R. Murrow,

22:24.343 --> 22:27.137
Walter Cronkite,
Rod Serling, Ernie Kovacs.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.140
We had shows like <i>The Defenders,</i>
<i>All in the Family--</i>

22:30.223 --> 22:31.683
I'm a nostalgia buff myself,

22:31.767 --> 22:33.810
but maybe we could stick
to current events here.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.688
-How about it, Al?
-(laughs) Current events. How fitting.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.983
One could argue
that the steep decline of TV

22:40.067 --> 22:42.235
began with a show called <i>A Current Affair,</i>

22:42.319 --> 22:44.571
which introduced tabloid journalism--

22:44.654 --> 22:46.615
-Headed down memory lane again.
-Will you shut up!

22:52.454 --> 22:56.375
There used to be standards
of excellence in television.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.336
I'm not talking only
about Emmys and Peabodys.

22:59.419 --> 23:03.465
But not so long ago, broadcasters
had a real sense of responsibility.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.009
They took their statutory
obligation to operate

23:06.093 --> 23:08.678
in the public interest very seriously.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.597
Now the networks

23:10.680 --> 23:13.767
look for our guilty pleasures
and morbid curiosities,

23:13.850 --> 23:16.937
and pander to those with the hope
that they'll get us addicted.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.398
Once you get people hooked,
you've got 'em.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.191
And you have to get people hooked,

23:21.274 --> 23:26.905
because everything today is ratings,
demographics, market share, money.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.908
Even the news divisions
are now profit centers.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.619
Which means that if good-looking,
white-toothed anchors

23:32.702 --> 23:35.288
have better TVQ's than credentialed
journalists, you get the eye candy.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.250
And if positive coverage
of the war in Iraq

23:38.333 --> 23:40.794
reaches more households, you get Fox News.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.504
In fact, today you can switch
back and forth

23:42.587 --> 23:44.881
between the right-wing news
and the left-wing news.

23:44.965 --> 23:48.135
Whatever happened
to Huntley and Brinkley, John Chancellor?

23:48.218 --> 23:50.178
To news? It was just "the news."

23:50.470 --> 23:54.891
Now we have partisan junk appealing
to the lowest common denominator--

23:54.975 --> 23:55.809
MELVIN: Your Honor?

23:55.892 --> 23:58.520
Which brings us currently
to the program at issue, <i>Dr. Ray.</i>

23:58.812 --> 24:03.191
Mr. Palmer said his client
couldn't possibly have seen this coming.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.568
Well, that simply isn't true.

24:05.485 --> 24:08.071
This tragedy was inevitable.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.240
It's practically scripted.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.741
It's happened before.

24:12.409 --> 24:16.913
Talk show ambushes have gone awry
leading to murder or suicide.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.959
This isn't a first.
But here's what's truly horrifying.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.421
A tragedy occurred here.
A woman was killed.

24:24.504 --> 24:28.592
But for the show-- For the show,
the real tragedy was

24:28.675 --> 24:30.302
that the killing didn't happen
on the show.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.386
Oh, Your Honor, I object.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.512
ALAN: That would've been
the ratings blockbuster.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.599
That would've been the big score
everybody was hoping for.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.809
But they had to settle
for the next best thing,

24:37.893 --> 24:39.769
which was that the murder became news.

24:39.853 --> 24:43.023
The nightly news was perfectly happy
to do the job for them.

24:43.106 --> 24:45.734
They gave <i>Dr. Ray</i> all the promotion
it could possibly want,

24:45.817 --> 24:49.154
airing sensational clips
and graphics from the show

24:49.237 --> 24:50.614
again and again and again.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.742
And you see how it all works
so beautifully together.

24:53.825 --> 24:54.826
The girl is killed.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.454
The show benefits, the news benefits,
and we eat it up.

25:00.290 --> 25:05.253
Psychologically damaged people
are paraded onstage

25:05.337 --> 25:08.965
to be exploited, ridiculed, taunted.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.718
Of course this is what we get.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.055
And we stand to get a lot more of it,
because it sells,

25:15.138 --> 25:17.933
and it costs almost nothing to produce.
And what's not to love?

25:18.767 --> 25:22.437
Here we had an emotionally unstable
ex-boyfriend with a history of violence

25:22.521 --> 25:24.105
armed with a marriage proposal

25:24.189 --> 25:26.525
certain to be rejected
in front of the world.

25:26.608 --> 25:29.027
And the fact that an innocent
young woman ended up butchered

25:29.110 --> 25:32.364
was good business for all. Just business.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.492
Well, so is a lawsuit.

25:38.995 --> 25:42.249
The most memorable part
of the movie <i>Network</i>

25:42.332 --> 25:45.126
was when Howard Beale
started shouting on national television,

25:45.210 --> 25:47.837
"I'm mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take it anymore,"

25:47.921 --> 25:49.923
and the country joined in with him.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.342
You need to join in now.

25:52.425 --> 25:55.929
You need to go back to that room
and say you're not gonna sit quietly

25:56.012 --> 25:58.598
and let these networks
assault decency for profit.

25:58.682 --> 26:02.185
You're not going to stand for
the exploitation of the disenfranchised.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.354
You're sick of the networks
debasing a medium

26:04.437 --> 26:05.564
they're supposed to be guardians of.

26:05.647 --> 26:11.486
Don't take it anymore. Please.
Please, get mad as hell

26:12.404 --> 26:13.572
and don't take it...

26:15.448 --> 26:16.366
anymore.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.434
-Did you go to college, sir?
-No.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.935
I was drafted right out of high school.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.896
When I got back from my tour of duty...

26:48.815 --> 26:50.817
You were diagnosed as bipolar,

26:50.900 --> 26:53.278
suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.363
You were prescribed lithium.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.161
I'm not crazy.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.749
Ethan, let's-- Let's talk about the seals.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.250
ETHAN: Mainly I tried to fish.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.461
I was starving. I harvested some seals.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.004
Did you ever apply for welfare?

27:11.087 --> 27:12.464
I don't believe in handouts.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.009
If a man can provide for himself,
he should, and I could,

27:16.635 --> 27:18.803
only the federal government
wouldn't let me.

27:19.971 --> 27:23.850
I-I don't know what to argue, really.
He's a serial seal-killer.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.810
He won't let you argue insanity?

27:25.894 --> 27:28.605
Well, I couldn't even if he would.
We-we didn't plead it.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.983
All I can say, really,
is he lacked the capacity

27:32.067 --> 27:34.361
to form the necessary intent
to commit the crime.

27:36.112 --> 27:39.032
-I'm sure you'll be fine.
-Can you imagine?

27:39.115 --> 27:43.787
He's out in the harbor
in a five-foot skiff trying to fish.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.247
-A 60-year-old man.
-I know, it's awful.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.793
-(device beeps)
-I feel so badly for him.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.838
And a war veteran.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.258
Denny, are you okay?

27:57.342 --> 28:00.470
Well, it's just the thought
of a man starving.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.889
-(water splattering)
-(Denny sighs)

28:03.515 --> 28:05.183
-What the--
-A fisherman to boot.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.060
I hate it when people starve.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.270
All those little babies in Africa.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.606
-Is everything all right?
-No!

28:11.690 --> 28:13.983
World hunger? Darfur? AIDS?

28:14.442 --> 28:17.821
Oh, it's sad. So sad.

28:18.405 --> 28:22.575
Oh! God-- For God's sake,
what have you done?

28:22.659 --> 28:25.870
-Nothing. I just listened to you--
-Stop it.

28:25.954 --> 28:30.417
-I found my own voice.
-(device whines, stops)

28:31.042 --> 28:32.168
(exhales)

28:33.878 --> 28:37.090
Why do you have little hoses
attached to your face? The truth.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.384
Well, it's just that I-I didn't--

28:39.467 --> 28:41.386
-The truth, Denny, or I'm leaving.
-No, no. Don't.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.266
It's just...

28:47.308 --> 28:48.893
I wanted to make you love me again.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.271
Excuse me?

28:51.896 --> 28:55.692
I-I wanted you to be
reminded of the soft, sensitive me.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.027
You said you wanted to rekindle the old--

28:58.111 --> 29:02.282
So I thought I'd cinch the deal
with a-a few tears.

29:03.533 --> 29:07.162
Denny, I-I'm not looking
to rekindle that.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.664
-You weren't?
-No.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.834
Is that what you
thought this dinner was about?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.463
No. (chuckles)

29:17.464 --> 29:20.383
I was just kidding around. Don't be silly.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.344
-Denny, you're-you're a dear friend, but--
-I gotta go.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.562
-What were you thinking?
-I don't know.

29:32.645 --> 29:35.482
-You wired your face for tears!
-Oh, lay off, will you?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.025
Hindsight is always easy.

29:43.239 --> 29:46.785
I thought maybe you were experiencing
issues of guilt over the murder,

29:46.868 --> 29:49.662
and, well, you could maybe start over.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.791
-You think you're funny.
-It's the clown issue too, isn't it?

29:52.874 --> 29:55.251
No, no. No, it's simply a mocking issue.
Look at the way--

29:55.335 --> 29:57.170
(toy clown laughing)

29:57.253 --> 29:59.714
Take it away, would you, please?
Take it away!

30:00.423 --> 30:02.217
I think you two
will eventually work this out.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.345
-As you say, it's all harmless pretending.
-(scoffs)

30:07.222 --> 30:08.139
Uh...

30:22.904 --> 30:24.989
-(yells)
-What are you doing?

30:25.073 --> 30:27.951
You see? No matter-- You can't-- It--

30:28.034 --> 30:30.829
It always comes up smiling, taunting me!
It won't stay down!

30:31.579 --> 30:33.039
-(gunshot)
-Oh, gee-- Denny!

30:33.122 --> 30:35.500
-Well, that's what you wanted, isn't it?
-You carry a gun on you?

30:35.583 --> 30:36.793
So what? I know exact--

30:36.876 --> 30:39.337
-(woman gasps)
-Judas Priest.

30:39.712 --> 30:42.215
(air hissing)

30:44.551 --> 30:45.760
(grunts)

30:49.389 --> 30:51.516
LAWYER:
It's not like we're out to get Mr. Melman.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.936
But he willfully, repeatedly,
overtly broke a federal law,

30:55.019 --> 30:57.021
in a dangerous manner, I might add.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.858
How many times are we gonna let it go
before we finally say, "Enough."

30:59.941 --> 31:02.527
We're gonna prosecute
and put you in prison?"

31:11.870 --> 31:15.331
When I drive to work,
I periodically come to street corners

31:15.415 --> 31:20.837
where homeless Vietnam vets
or Gulf War vets beg for food money.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.340
I try not to look.
It makes me uncomfortable.

31:24.757 --> 31:29.137
Just easier to look the other way,
and boy, have we as a nation done that.

31:31.806 --> 31:35.226
Thousands and thousands
of Vietnam vets have been lost

31:35.310 --> 31:38.187
to poverty, drugs or suicide
in this country,

31:38.271 --> 31:41.024
and our statistics on the military in Iraq
are even worse.

31:41.482 --> 31:44.986
With repeated tours of duty,
soldiers are 50 percent more likely

31:45.069 --> 31:49.574
to suffer serious mental illnesses
including post-traumatic stress disorder.

31:50.533 --> 31:55.038
We've all heard about the 4,000 kids
we've lost in battle in Iraq.

31:55.121 --> 32:00.543
But here at home, in the year 2005 alone,

32:01.044 --> 32:06.049
we had 6,200 suicides among those
who serve in our armed services.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.675
It is an epidemic.

32:07.759 --> 32:11.429
Excuse me, but this case is not about
the plight of soldiers that fight in Iraq.

32:11.512 --> 32:14.599
It's about soldiers, period,
of which my client was one.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.852
Yes, but are you suggesting special
treatment for soldiers that break the law?

32:17.936 --> 32:23.650
Special treatment? Judge,
these veterans sacrificed their lives.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.027
Some of them are maimed.
Some of them are rendered mentally ill,

32:26.110 --> 32:29.322
and we can't even guarantee them soup.

32:30.239 --> 32:33.368
No, they hardly get special treatment.
The seal seems to.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.789
We can shoot coyotes,
hunt moose, slaughter cattle,

32:37.872 --> 32:39.832
let's not even discuss
what we do to chickens,

32:39.916 --> 32:42.377
but we actually have a law
protecting the seal.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.880
Why? They're not endangered.
Is it because they're cute?

32:46.339 --> 32:50.468
Easy to look at, as opposed to starving,
mentally ill war veterans?

32:52.261 --> 32:53.972
We're the United States,

32:54.639 --> 32:58.726
the richest nation in the world,
and we abandon our vets.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.938
We let them starve.
We do not take care of them.

33:02.814 --> 33:07.235
But, hey, as long as we slap
a bumper sticker on our car

33:07.318 --> 33:10.780
that says we support our troops,
I-I guess it's okay.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.159
Ethan Melman is a war-decorated hero.

33:15.243 --> 33:18.246
He returned suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

33:18.329 --> 33:21.082
It made holding down employment difficult,

33:21.165 --> 33:23.876
so his insurance lapsed,
and he didn't get treatment,

33:24.335 --> 33:25.753
and he began to starve.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.423
He didn't rob anybody.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.760
He didn't break into a bank,
or knock over a liquor store,

33:32.844 --> 33:35.763
or snatch a popsicle
out of someone's hand.

33:36.973 --> 33:40.393
He went fishing, perhaps hunting,

33:41.436 --> 33:44.022
and the federal government,
instead of offering him a meal,

33:44.105 --> 33:47.984
decides to spend 30 to $40,000
of money we do not have

33:48.067 --> 33:49.902
to offer him a jail cell.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.991
Special treatment, no.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.536
Decent treatment might be nice.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.604
MELVIN: 750. Take it or leave it.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.856
(door opens)

34:29.901 --> 34:30.902
Leave it.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.822
Alan, if they find her contributorily
negligent, we could get nothing.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.324
-Plus unforeseeability--
-Jerry.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.661
-Tick tock.
-Your call.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.455
-I think we'll get more.
-Alan.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.124
I think we'll get more.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.376
We are at the buzzer.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.673
-Reject it.
-(Jerry gulps)

34:54.092 --> 34:55.551
You heard him, Mr. Palmer.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.971
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

34:59.222 --> 35:01.432
-We have, Your Honor.
-And what say you?

35:02.141 --> 35:06.020
Uh, we, the jury, in the matter
of <i>Beckham vs. Worldwide Pictures,</i>

35:06.104 --> 35:08.106
find in favor of the plaintiff,

35:08.189 --> 35:12.443
and we order the defendant to pay damages
in the amount of $4.3 million.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.321
Did-did he just say--

35:15.404 --> 35:20.243
Your Honor, I ask that the verdict be
set aside on grounds of being excessive.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.328
Mr. Palmer...

35:22.703 --> 35:24.372
shut up!

35:24.789 --> 35:29.377
All right. The jury is excused
with the court's thanks.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.671
-We are adjourned.
-(gavel thuds)

35:32.213 --> 35:34.215
Disappointed, Melvin?
Three pops for a yes.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.636
I gotta hand it to you, Al.
A hoot till the end.

35:38.719 --> 35:42.140
-That's me.
-Hell, I get paid win or lose.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.683
Hell, now that we get to appeal,

35:43.766 --> 35:47.520
I just made more money.
That's what I did. (clicks tongue)

35:55.862 --> 35:56.696
(knocks on door)

35:58.322 --> 35:59.240
Busy.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.494
Denny.

36:08.958 --> 36:12.545
Shirley, why did you invite me to dinner?

36:14.881 --> 36:16.841
Because I adore you.

36:18.134 --> 36:21.888
I've let some friendships
either atrophy or...

36:22.680 --> 36:23.681
And, well,

36:25.057 --> 36:28.269
I suppose I'm worried about you.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.440
That's it? You're--
You're worried about me?

36:32.982 --> 36:35.735
Denny, you're walking around
without your pants on,

36:35.818 --> 36:38.112
-your face wired for tears.
-I explained the pants.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.365
The tears were for you.

36:44.702 --> 36:48.289
You don't see us
getting back together at all?

36:48.372 --> 36:50.458
-It's so far beyond the bucket?
-Pale.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.628
-What?
-It's "beyond the pale," not the "bucket."

36:53.711 --> 36:56.505
Shirley, we love each other.

36:59.467 --> 37:03.804
I do love you, Denny,
but not in a romantic way.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.765
Aw, come on, Shirley.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.936
At our age, if our heart skips a beat,
it could kill us.

37:11.437 --> 37:15.608
You gotta give up on this...
romance thing.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.657
-Nobody ever gives up on it.
-(knocks on door)

37:23.908 --> 37:25.493
-Judge is back.
-Thank you.

37:28.079 --> 37:31.499
Denny, you're not in trial. It's my judge.

37:38.506 --> 37:43.010
Had a little malfunction
on the tear machine.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.014
I gotta get the kinks worked out.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.644
Once I do, I'll...

38:11.956 --> 38:14.125
I realize our nation has a deficit,

38:14.208 --> 38:17.420
and we can't feed everybody
nor get them health insurance.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.672
But it seems to me,

38:19.755 --> 38:23.843
if a soldier risks his life
in battle for this country,

38:25.428 --> 38:27.096
this country owes him something in return,

38:27.763 --> 38:29.348
if not legally, morally.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.560
I find Mr. Melman not guilty.

38:32.935 --> 38:35.146
-Oh, my!
-We are adjourned.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.523
-Thank you, Shirley.
-(Shirley chuckles)

38:37.606 --> 38:38.816
You saved my life.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.402
How about I take you
to dinner to celebrate?

38:41.485 --> 38:42.320
Oh.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.572
I know a cozy place
that serves marine mammals.

38:44.655 --> 38:48.326
Oh, if you don't mind,
I think I'm gonna pass. (chuckles)

38:50.745 --> 38:52.371
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:53.080 --> 38:53.998
Thank you, Shirley.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.960
Oh! I-I will pay my bill.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.610
And he just continued to smile
as if he'd won,

39:23.569 --> 39:27.365
that same horrific grin as the Bobo doll.

39:29.909 --> 39:30.910
(sighs)

39:32.536 --> 39:35.664
Much as I wanted to help my client
in this case, I'm ashamed to admit,

39:35.956 --> 39:39.543
my overriding drive
was to beat Melvin Palmer.

39:40.836 --> 39:41.754
I know it sounds crazy,

39:41.837 --> 39:45.633
but he really did bring back
memories of the Bobo doll.

39:46.133 --> 39:50.554
It would just keep popping back up
with that expression, "You lose."

39:53.349 --> 39:55.393
Lorraine thinks
it's self-loathing on my part.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.646
We're all victims of our childhood,
one way or another.

40:02.358 --> 40:05.986
-I'm sorry about things with Shirley.
-Yeah.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.783
<i>Que</i> Saran, Saran.

40:12.952 --> 40:13.786
<i>Sera.</i>

40:14.829 --> 40:18.457
-Really? I thought it was Saran.
-No, <i>sera.</i>

40:18.749 --> 40:23.379
-What's "Saran"?
-It's a-a wrap. Keeps sandwiches fresh.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.802
See, if I had been the one
to break it off with Shirley--

40:30.678 --> 40:32.930
Nah, it's all male ego anyway.

40:33.806 --> 40:36.142
It's like you having to prove yourself
in court, and--

40:36.809 --> 40:38.769
We're hardwired, that's, uh...

40:39.520 --> 40:41.647
Just don't wanna be seen as losers.

40:43.941 --> 40:47.653
I think we live our lives
so afraid to be seen as weak

40:47.736 --> 40:51.365
that we die, perhaps,
without ever having been seen at all.

40:54.160 --> 40:57.037
Denny, do you ever worry
that when you die, people will

40:57.455 --> 41:00.207
never have truly known you?

41:01.041 --> 41:03.627
I don't want 'em to know me.
I want them to believe my version.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.008
Besides, you know me.

41:11.886 --> 41:12.803
That's enough.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.642
Lorraine thinks,
until I get professional help,

41:18.726 --> 41:22.146
I will forever be disabled
when it comes to forging

41:22.229 --> 41:25.357
a truly intimate relationship with...
somebody.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.652
-Who needs one?
-Well, I'll tell you something.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.112
You've got one with me.

41:30.404 --> 41:33.032
You have met somebody
who likes you for who you are.

41:33.782 --> 41:38.579
I mean, cigars, Scotch,
that's a true relationship.

41:39.413 --> 41:42.666
And... I love you.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.086
Bonus points.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.259
-So I'm all right.
-Yeah. We both are.

41:52.718 --> 41:56.764
That's why we like to sit out here.
It reminds us...

41:59.308 --> 42:00.351
We're all right.

42:00.476 --> 42:01.560

NARRATOR: <i>Next on</i> Boston Legal...

42:19.453 --> 42:21.038
We want to build a weapon
of mass destruction

42:21.121 --> 42:22.206
that we control.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.582
-By "we" you mean?
-Nantucket.

42:23.666 --> 42:27.586
An atomic bomb on Nantucket?

42:27.670 --> 42:29.964
-I met somebody wonderful.
-Fab. And?

42:30.047 --> 42:33.217
She's saying I drugged her.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.303
Dad? It's me. It's Shirley.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.888
He doesn't recognize any of us.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.014
I sympathize.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.560
My own father died of Alzheimer's.
But we have laws.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.895
We'll be asking the court's permission
to put him to sleep?

42:44.979 --> 42:49.900
-Yes.
-Proceeding will be rough, Shirley.
