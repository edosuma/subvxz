00:01.126 --> 00:02.753
[woman] <i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.464
[man] <i>These visions that you're having,
don't ignore them.</i>

00:05.547 --> 00:08.133
<i>The unconscious is a very powerful thing.</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:09.384
[Murphy] <i>I mean, we want to believe...</i>

00:10.385 --> 00:12.221
but you've got to give us
something to believe in.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.305
Look.

00:15.807 --> 00:16.767
What'd you see?

00:17.226 --> 00:19.394
I felt it. What she's feeling.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.190
[Warren] <i>I don't know what we're doing.</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:27.194
<i>-These dreams, visions, hallucinations...</i>
-[screaming]

00:27.277 --> 00:29.196
<i>...and I still don't know what it means.</i>

00:29.279 --> 00:32.282
Black Rainbow is a biological weapon
of mass destruction.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.659
The Reset.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.453
That's what Zona was working on.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.956
Killing everything
so that they could start over.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.500
You said that they changed
the launch codes. Can we change them back?

00:41.583 --> 00:45.337
[woman] <i>You must have the thumbprint
of the President of the United States</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:46.588
to change the codes.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.632
Looks like...

00:50.175 --> 00:51.677
we're going to Washington.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.249
[zombie growling]

01:22.332 --> 01:23.625
This is it.

01:23.709 --> 01:24.793
Mount Weather.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.088
If Kaya's right,
the President is still here.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.590
"Trespassers will be shot."

01:32.426 --> 01:35.429
Isn't what's left of the US government
in Newmerica by now?

01:35.512 --> 01:37.306
Mount Weather's a continuity
of government site.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.516
So this'll be the last place
they evacuate.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.310
We were still getting orders out of here.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.270
Back when we were still getting orders.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.314
Continuity of government.
Don't you love it?

01:45.397 --> 01:49.276
During a nuclear war,
the entire US government gets relocated

01:49.359 --> 01:51.194
to a secure underground facility.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.114
The rest of us, get blown to smithereens.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.451
Great idea for a nuclear holocaust.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.995
For a zombie apocalypse, not so much.

02:00.078 --> 02:03.081
Well, we're close.
Keep your eyes open for anything living.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.044
Have mercy.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.058
There it is.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.478
We can get to the door this way.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.482
Looks like we got vehicles up ahead.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.362
This must be the motorcade
Citizen Z saw from the satellite.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.449
Looks like the President
couldn't make it inside.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.077
Big ass doors don't do much good
if you're on the wrong side of them.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.632
Clear.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.394
Clear.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.281
I see bodies.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.449
Yeah, but whose?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.493
Watch out for President Zombie.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.164
Secret Service.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.252
[woman] Secret Service here, too.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.841
-[Murphy] Mad Zs?
-Nah, old school.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.052
Is this the President?

03:39.136 --> 03:41.388
Sort of. But all the good parts are gone.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.890
And no thumb on this hand.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.685
There's no hand on this hand.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.106
Well, eaten by your own
Secret Service detail.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.191
That's some messed up shit.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.819
Well, chief, we got a President
with no thumbs.

03:55.902 --> 03:56.903
Now what?

03:57.404 --> 04:00.615
-We go inside.
-We go inside? Why?

04:00.699 --> 04:03.201
The President's dead.
We can't change the launch codes.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.541
Fuh-goat-us?

04:10.125 --> 04:11.376
What the hell's that?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.628
First Gentleman of the United States.

04:13.712 --> 04:17.048
This isn't the President.
This is the President's husband.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.051
That means the President
could still be in there.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.603
Well, those are... big.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.062
Damn sure they're locked.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.898
Not for long.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.525
[bleeping]

04:38.779 --> 04:39.780
Damn.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.740
What's wrong?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.283
There's a retina scanner.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.660
He needs to look into the scanner
while you swipe the card.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.287
Or at least his eyeball does.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.372
You thinking what I'm thinking?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.751
Yep.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.252
Eww!

05:10.936 --> 05:12.771
[groans]

05:16.775 --> 05:17.818
[Warren] Got it?

05:21.279 --> 05:23.907
Let's do this quick. This is really nasty.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.034
-Ready?
-OK. Go.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.411
[electronic humming]

05:28.495 --> 05:29.871
Damn it.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.457
I got to remove the zombie cataract.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.583
OK. All right.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.218
[theme music]

06:17.919 --> 06:19.379
No sign of Zs so far.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.755
That's a good sign.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.966
No humans either.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.884
At least they have power.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.304
Well, keep your eyes peeled
for signs of life.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
Keep 'em peeled for the dead too.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.017
All right, Executive,
Judicial, and Legislative?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.476
Start at the top.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.860
Why does it always gotta be underground?

06:41.943 --> 06:45.614
Can't we, for once, have a big showdown
in a penthouse or aviary?

06:45.697 --> 06:47.324
Something with a window.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.967
Looks like it's all zombie
all the time around here.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.559
[Warren] Any sign of life?

07:14.643 --> 07:15.810
Empty.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.812
We're too late.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.522
We need to find the Oval Office.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.858
What happened to Doc and Murphy?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.235
I think they're in there.

07:25.904 --> 07:26.905
Wow!

07:28.156 --> 07:29.366
Wow!

07:29.950 --> 07:31.743
My mind is now officially blown.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.745
I told you Big Foot was real.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.916
What's in there?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.042
Everything.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.381
Department of Cryptozoology?

07:46.049 --> 07:46.967
[Warren] Let's go!

07:53.890 --> 07:55.266
No more detours.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.943
Congressional Chambers.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.491
-[growling]
-Senators?

08:11.574 --> 08:12.993
Congressmen?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.038
Uh... Of course they're Zs.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.750
All right. Murphy, Doc, in here.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.085
Sarge and 10K.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.798
Oh, I guess this one's mine.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.099
Doc, what do you think?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.559
The Paso Doble?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.977
Electric slide.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.356
It's time for a recount.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.484
I voted for you!

08:48.528 --> 08:49.946
This is why we should have term limits.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.870
That's no way to treat a tax payer.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.124
Veto that!

09:03.585 --> 09:04.586
Yeah.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.796
Way to keep democracy alive.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.847
Damn, if he'd stop flip flopping,
I could mercy him.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.402
Show off.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.914
Well, I think we just killed
the last of the US government.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.166
Maybe their approval ratings
will finally go up.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.751
Well, we still need to find the President.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.877
More Secret Service Zs.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.338
I got this.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.381
-I'm with you.
-Great.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.717
Maybe the President's nearby.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.636
-All this for a thumb.
-[chuckles]

09:56.054 --> 09:58.306
Freeze! Secret Service.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.152
Look, we're not trying to cause trouble.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.904
Funny, 'cause we just heard gunfire.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.240
In our line of work,
that's usually an indication of trouble.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.283
Yeah, well we just had to mercy
a bunch of Congressmen

10:17.367 --> 10:19.536
that were craving brains instead of votes.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.579
Only reason we didn't shoot you.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.164
Now who are you?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.209
I'm Lieutenant Roberta Warren,
National Guard.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.378
We're on a special mission
to save humanity.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.713
It is imperative
that we see the President.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.177
I'm Agent Johnson.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.429
[breathes deeply]

10:38.513 --> 10:39.973
And that's...

10:40.056 --> 10:41.432
Agent Johnson.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.394
Before you ask,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.479
no, we're not related.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.773
And yes, it's weird
that we're both named Johnson.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.360
Do you always have to say that?
It undermines our authority.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.112
These give us our authority.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.741
Now what were you saying
about saving humanity?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.994
'Bout eight years too late,
don't you think?

11:01.077 --> 11:03.454
[both laugh]

11:05.331 --> 11:08.168
Look, we have reason to believe
that someone intends to launch

11:08.251 --> 11:11.796
some kind of biological attack
on all surviving humans and zombies

11:11.880 --> 11:13.298
in order to cleanse the world

11:13.381 --> 11:16.509
and repopulate it
with their genetically-modified offspring.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.056
And you've got a problem with this?

11:25.894 --> 11:28.354
Can I just speak to the President?

11:28.438 --> 11:30.523
We can't just let everybody who thinks
they have an emergency

11:30.607 --> 11:32.901
speak to the President.
She'd never get anything done.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.904
Does she know her husband is dead?

11:36.779 --> 11:37.614
Yes.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.909
-I know he's dead.
-[Johnson] Madame President.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.620
What's going on?

11:44.370 --> 11:47.248
Intruders. It's under control, ma'am.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.250
I'm sorry.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.211
But we really need your help.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.548
Agent Johnson, put your weapon down.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.467
Which one?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.135
[sighs] Both of you.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.596
Hang on. You're the President?

12:10.271 --> 12:13.816
Jane Carlson,
234th President of the United States.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.319
We're a little short of help here.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.528
How many survivors are there?

12:17.612 --> 12:19.113
You're looking at them.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.450
There's only three of you left
in this whole complex?

12:22.533 --> 12:23.868
There were four of us.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.288
Most of what was left of the government
evacuated to NewMerica a few weeks ago.

12:28.122 --> 12:32.335
We were supposed to follow them,
but we've run into a few obstacles.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.254
Yeah, well, we just killed
a few obstacles for you back there.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.215
And thank you for that.

12:37.799 --> 12:38.800
Sure.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.094
The last of Congress.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.012
Not much of a loss.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.556
They were dead a week
before anybody realized.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.517
Madame President, time is of the essence.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.895
We are on a mission
to find a secret government weapon.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.772
And we need your help to access it.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.107
What can I do?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.568
We gonna need your thumbprint.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.785
My thumbprint?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.954
Yeah. I know it sounds crazy--

13:08.037 --> 13:09.122
Stand down.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.583
I hope you didn't go to too much trouble
to come here

13:12.667 --> 13:14.877
because I've got bad news for you.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.963
My thumbprint...

13:17.046 --> 13:19.090
isn't going to help with anything.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.345
Both of them?

13:27.265 --> 13:28.766
[Murphy] Eww.

13:31.310 --> 13:35.148
I didn't know when I inherited the job
my thumbs would be in such demand.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.234
What happened?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.821
Let's talk in the Oval Office.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.381
It's not as glamorous
as the actual Oval Office,

14:00.465 --> 14:02.550
but we do have bottled water.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.970
And Presidential jelly beans from the 80s.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.723
Go ahead and help yourself.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.730
Not to be rude, but I have to ask. What--?

14:15.813 --> 14:17.190
What happened to my thumbs?

14:18.441 --> 14:19.734
It's a weird story.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.653
A few days ago I had another visitor.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.948
<i>I didn't understand
what he wanted at first.</i>

14:26.032 --> 14:29.494
<i>He told me he could kill me
and then cut off my thumbs,</i>

14:29.577 --> 14:31.579
<i>or I could take the sedative
he was offering.</i>

14:32.413 --> 14:34.624
<i>He'd cut off my thumbs,
but I'd still live.</i>

14:35.666 --> 14:38.002
<i>I tried to tell him
it wasn't my thumbs he needed.</i>

14:38.711 --> 14:40.129
<i>But he wouldn't listen.</i>

14:40.213 --> 14:42.590
<i>He had already drugged
agents Johnson and Johnson.</i>

14:43.257 --> 14:44.634
<i>What choice did I have?</i>

14:49.514 --> 14:52.016
When I woke up... he was gone.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.227
So were my thumbs.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.521
He never told me why.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.439
Well, your thumbs would've given us access

14:58.523 --> 15:01.984
to change the launch codes
for some kind of doomsday weapon.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.905
I'll tell you the same thing
I tried to tell him.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.491
-You don't need my thumbprint.
-I don't understand.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.410
Do you know what happens
when a president dies?

15:10.493 --> 15:12.495
They turn zombie and eat people?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.289
No. I mean, who takes over the office?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.750
The vice president. Everybody knows that.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.212
And if the vice president dies,
it goes to the Speaker of the House.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.965
Then the President of the Senate,
then each cabinet member in turn.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.759
OK, so I don't understand
what this has to do with your thumbs?

15:27.510 --> 15:29.345
When the last president died,

15:29.429 --> 15:32.223
I was an assistant
to the Secretary of Labor.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.934
By the time the line of succession
got to the Secretary,

15:35.017 --> 15:37.854
he was dead and I was acting Secretary.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.939
So I got the top job.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.149
Which means you're the President,

15:41.232 --> 15:44.902
which is why we need...
needed, your thumbprint.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.821
You don't need my thumbprint.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.450
You need the thumbprint of the person
who was president during the outbreak.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.035
You need President Bill Carney's thumb.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.495
Yeah, but he died during Black Summer.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.832
He turned Z. But last time I saw him,

15:57.915 --> 15:59.292
he still had his thumb.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.669
OK, so even if we use his zombie thumb,

16:01.752 --> 16:03.880
we still got to find him,
and he could be anywhere by now.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.631
That's where I can help you.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.091
I know where he is.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.093
Right here in Mount Weather.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.261
That's great.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.014
Twenty-five levels below us.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.682
That's not so great.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.310
It's a chance.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.395
Madame President, can you take us to him?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.647
That level's infested with zombies.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.108
There is approximately
zero chance of that happening.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.068
We can't let the President risk her life.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.404
We are almost out of designated survivors.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.906
Johnson here is next.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.951
We're bugging out to NewMerica
as soon as the exfil team arrives.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.205
If you'd arrived a day later,
we wouldn't even be here.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.041
You know, without them,

16:40.124 --> 16:42.460
this is starting to feel like
a suicide mission.

16:43.044 --> 16:46.547
Yeah, we have to try.
It's the only way to access Black Rainbow.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.341
Did you say Black Rainbow?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.427
Yeah. It's from my dream.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.055
It's hard to explain.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.515
Did Teller send you?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.061
You know Dr. Teller?

17:00.770 --> 17:03.648
There's something
I'm supposed to show you.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.774
You knew I was coming?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.275
I knew somebody was coming.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.778
I just wasn't expecting
that creepy bastard

17:08.861 --> 17:10.112
who stole my thumbs.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.079
Check out that rig.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.039
Haven't seen one of those since the 80s.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.708
Where'd you get that?
The Department of Jurassic Technology?

17:22.792 --> 17:24.794
This is what happens
when you get your budget cut.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.389
You need to see this.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.976
-What is it?
-Go ahead.

17:40.059 --> 17:40.893
Play it.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.081
You just got to bang it.
It's the tracking.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.844
Black Rainbow?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.001
[cheery music]

18:47.084 --> 18:50.046

<i>Our major cities are gone.</i>

<i>Anyone who survives Day One</i>

19:14.737 --> 19:18.574

<i>And as the radiation dissipates,</i>

19:33.339 --> 19:37.093

[video cassette ejects]

20:38.487 --> 20:41.949
That's all we need,
another global doomsday weapon.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.994
And President Carney's thumb
will give you access to it?

20:45.786 --> 20:48.581
Yes, Madame President.
We've got to get that thumb.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.878
Under the circumstances,
I think I better go with you after all.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.715
-[both] Madame President.
-I've made up my mind.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.510
Thank you, Madame President.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.513
Call me Jane.

21:05.556 --> 21:06.682
Follow me.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.319
The last working elevator
to the lower levels is down here.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.656
They cut off access to the bottom floors
a few weeks after Day One.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.493
Nobody's been down there since.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.915
[elevator bell dings]

Level Z, please.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.013
[elevator motor starts up]

21:46.096 --> 21:47.515
President Carney and most of his cabinet

21:47.598 --> 21:50.267
were trapped near the NATO briefing room
on Level Z.

21:50.351 --> 21:53.813
Ah, will the apocalyptic ironies
never cease.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.608
A lot of the White House staff
was down there too.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.818
Most of Congress.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.444
The cast of <i>Hamilton.</i>

22:02.238 --> 22:03.697
All turned Z now.

Battering ram!

23:01.839 --> 23:02.923
Is this the President?

23:03.674 --> 23:05.384
No. Press Secretary.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.302
But we're getting close.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.139
Come on. You mean we got to check
every Z before we kill them?

23:10.222 --> 23:12.850
Welcome to the nothing's-ever-easy club.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.643
How many people did you say
were down here?

23:14.727 --> 23:16.061
Most of the West Wing.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.938
This floor had a few hundred
personnel on it.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.357
Well, this is gonna take a while.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.942
Where's Warren?

23:22.026 --> 23:24.320
[zombies pound on door]

24:12.493 --> 24:14.161
Well, no going this way.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.871
We got to go back and find Warren.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.414
Well, how? We're surrounded.

24:17.498 --> 24:21.210
-That lobby is full of lobbyists.
-Well, we can't just leave her out there.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.629
I didn't come all the way down here
to turn back when we're so close.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.091
-I don't like it.
-Me neither.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.760
Quicker we find the dead president,
quicker we can go back for your friend.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.553
[pounding continues]

24:32.262 --> 24:34.431
[zombies growl]

24:47.528 --> 24:50.155
Hey, you think maybe
this belonged to the President?

24:51.949 --> 24:53.992
Hard to say. Could be.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.662
It's got a flag on it. Murphy.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.249
What am I supposed to do with it?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.793
I thought maybe your zombie
whispering powers were coming back,

25:02.876 --> 25:04.169
and it might help you find him.

25:05.129 --> 25:08.048
-How?
-Well, his scent might be all over that.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.676
His scent? I'm not a bloodhound.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.136
You don't know until you try.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.931
Well, then we'll never know
because I'm not doing it.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.142
It's degrading.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.395
Dying in a bunker
200 feet underground is degrading too.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.939
Now, come on. Take a whiff.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.037
[sniffs]

25:43.667 --> 25:44.877
You get anything?

25:45.669 --> 25:47.087
Yeah.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.716
I'm getting the feeling that
the President needs a stronger deodorant.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.010
And we need a better plan
than me sniffing a jacket.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.511
If you two are through,

25:54.595 --> 25:56.138
I might have a plan.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.474
Yeah, Doc, if you'd shut up for a second

25:58.557 --> 26:00.684
and listen to the President
of the United States,

26:00.768 --> 26:01.894
she might have a plan.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.729
Go ahead.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.610
Anybody alive down here?

26:18.243 --> 26:19.077
Yeah,

26:20.078 --> 26:20.996
don't mind me.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.086
We have to check each one.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.422
-Ready?
-Let's get ready, guys.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.009
-Open.
-Let's open her up.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.264
Whoa! Whoa! One at a time, boys.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.811
-[growling]
-Is it him?

26:51.109 --> 26:54.154
All right. Next up. Let's keep 'em moving.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.283
Guys, she ain't even the right sex. Next.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.792
[fleshy stab]

Next.

[music playing faintly]

27:35.028 --> 27:36.446
Ten down.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.741
Are we seriously gonna do this
with dozens of zombies?

27:39.825 --> 27:41.368
If we have to.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.328
You know, you could help.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.038
We're guarding the President.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.374
In case anything makes it through you.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.585
-Ha!
-Ready?

27:53.297 --> 27:54.464
Let's go.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.595
[patriotic music playing]

28:20.032 --> 28:21.033
[President] Open.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.455
No.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.585
Hold on. Look.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.503
It's one of your Secret Service brothers.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.631
Agent Bickle.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.592
He carried the nuclear football.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.761
Back when there was a nuclear football.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.554
That's a good sign.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.181
The president should be nearby.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.183
Murphy, give him a sniff.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.560
-No.
-Come on, man. Just try.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.313
All right.
But I'm doing this under protest.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.024
And how is that different
from anything else you do?

28:54.107 --> 28:55.108
[sniffs]

28:57.110 --> 28:58.195
Nothing.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.988
-Wait.
-You got something?

29:02.991 --> 29:05.285
I dunno, I dunno. Maybe.
They all smell alike.

29:05.369 --> 29:06.954
Well, we got to be getting close.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.288
Let the next one in.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.882
Zombies don't like fingers.

I think it's him.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.385
Take him down!

30:04.886 --> 30:06.596
-Don't hurt his thumbs!
-I got a leg.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.598
Hey, Secret Service guys,
a little help here?

30:08.682 --> 30:10.183
-I got a leg.
-How can you tell?

30:10.267 --> 30:11.643
'Cause it's kicking me.

-Hurry. He's biting through my glove.
-[groans]

30:14.229 --> 30:17.065
He's feisty for a dead guy.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.664
Well, that wasn't too hard.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.547
[President] Um... bad news.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.132
That's not him.

30:43.759 --> 30:44.676
What?

30:44.760 --> 30:47.763
My bad. That's the Secretary of State.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.723
Or is it Agriculture?

30:50.682 --> 30:53.185
My God. I swear to God.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.565
[patriotic music continues]

31:18.210 --> 31:20.670
Why, hello, Mr. President.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.603
I would just like to officially
go on record as saying

31:36.686 --> 31:39.981
that this plan sucks, unilaterally.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.441
Well, it could be worse.

31:41.525 --> 31:42.359
How?

31:44.152 --> 31:47.447
You're right. The plan sucks.
But it's the only plan we got.

31:47.531 --> 31:50.117
-Just open it.
-[squeaking sound]

31:50.200 --> 31:51.284
[Murphy] Wait a minute.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.703
-What is that?
-Squeaking zombies?

31:54.287 --> 31:55.622
Only one way to find out.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.500
Warren!

32:02.879 --> 32:04.214
Is this him?

32:05.340 --> 32:06.341
Yes.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.301
That's the President.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.649
<i>Thumbs up. That has a whole new meaning.</i>

32:27.404 --> 32:30.073
Thank you, Madame President.
We're in your debt.

32:30.157 --> 32:33.577
You can thank me by voting for me
once we start holding elections again.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.370
[scoffs] Too soon.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.914
Always be politicking.

32:38.707 --> 32:39.833
It's in our nature.

32:46.256 --> 32:49.551
If we can stop Black Rainbow, maybe
there'll be an election again someday.

32:53.555 --> 32:56.391
What do you mean, stop Black Rainbow?

32:56.475 --> 32:57.809
I told you.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.061
That's what we're here to do.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.147
You never said anything about stopping it.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.773
That's why Teller sent me here.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.699
Everybody chill and no one gets hurt.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.203
Chill? Seriously, dude.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.206
Everybody be calm and nobody gets hurt,

33:19.289 --> 33:20.624
including you, Madame President.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.585
You see how much better it sounds
when she says it like that?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.797
Lower your weapon, Sergeant.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.007
Sorry, ma'am. No can do.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.719
That's a direct order.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.598
Remember, you took an oath when you joined
the armed forces of the United States.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.267
I am still your Commander-in-Chief.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.688
Obey the orders
of the President of the United States

33:43.772 --> 33:47.150
and the orders
of the officers appointed over me.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.485
So help me God.

33:55.408 --> 33:56.576
Sergeant,

33:56.660 --> 33:59.454
I am ordering you to assist
Agents Johnson and Johnson

33:59.538 --> 34:01.373
in securing these prisoners.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.171
Ma'am, please...

34:08.630 --> 34:11.132
You do not have to listen to her.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.143
Actually I do.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.400
I'm sorry.

34:30.694 --> 34:31.778
I took an oath.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.657
I'm a Marine. She's my Commander-in-Chief.

34:39.661 --> 34:42.038
I hope you'll have a chance
to vote for me one day.

34:43.915 --> 34:44.916
Now,

34:45.792 --> 34:49.921
let's go back to the Oval Office
and try to figure out what's going on.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.302
Let's.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.619
Dr. Teller had you retrieve
these toxic cylinders from Mercy Labs.

35:20.702 --> 35:23.580
And you think they'll somehow stop
Black Rainbow?

35:25.332 --> 35:27.500
I don't know. I'm not sure.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.544
Something I see in my dream.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.214
The dream you claim led you across the US?

35:35.425 --> 35:37.719
How much did Teller tell you
about The Reset?

35:38.470 --> 35:39.763
You know about The Reset?

35:40.472 --> 35:41.348
Of course.

35:42.432 --> 35:46.394
We were about to head out to Zona
and join The Founder when you showed up.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.481
You're going to Zona?
[chuckles] Good luck with that plan.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.524
Yeah, I thought you
were going to NewMerica?

35:51.608 --> 35:52.776
That's a cover story.

35:52.859 --> 35:56.237
NewMerica is doomed,
along with every zombie, ender,

35:56.321 --> 35:59.491
and assorted low priority human
left out there.

35:59.574 --> 36:03.078
The only way the planet will survive
is with The Reset.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.872
Killing everyone doesn't sound
like a survival plan to me.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.334
Those of us in Zona will live.

36:10.126 --> 36:13.630
And through us,
democracy will flourish again.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.049
Yeah, well, I think
you're forgetting the fact that

36:16.132 --> 36:17.967
there's gonna be nobody there to vote.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.388
The right people will be left to vote.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.599
The rest are just collateral damage.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.186
Think of it as gerrymandering
on a global scale.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.397
And given how few people will be left,

36:30.480 --> 36:33.066
my constituency
is already well established.

36:34.776 --> 36:38.238
Your plan is to allow Zona
to wipe out the rest of humanity?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.490
Exactly, Sergeant.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.410
You switched sides just in time.

36:45.286 --> 36:49.916
I think we'll start The Reset right here,
with these four.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.725
The Reset starts now.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.979
Sergeant, vote with your weapon.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.397
I vote no.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.607
[screams]

37:28.163 --> 37:29.205
Traitor!

37:29.289 --> 37:32.709
As a US soldier, I am required
to disobey any order

37:32.792 --> 37:34.919
-that is manifestly unjust.
-[growling]

37:35.003 --> 37:37.255
-I give you mercy.
-[gun blast]

37:41.342 --> 37:44.262
-Damn, Sarge.
-You just killed the President.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.680
She turned.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.016
Besides, we'll get another one.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.397
So, who's next in the line of succession?

37:54.481 --> 37:57.066
Democracy later.
Let's get him to the launch facility.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.492
Guys, Mad Zs!

38:17.712 --> 38:18.713
Here they come.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.006
Hit them with full auto.

38:22.008 --> 38:22.842
Now!

38:49.118 --> 38:51.538
[approaching footsteps]

38:51.621 --> 38:52.580
[growling]

38:52.664 --> 38:54.040
I'm out.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.709
Me, too. I got this.

39:40.003 --> 39:42.422
Warren? Are you OK?

39:42.505 --> 39:43.464
Warren?

39:44.340 --> 39:45.466
Give her a minute.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.302
Washington.

39:49.637 --> 39:53.308
Hey, so now that we got
ol' president Thumbelina here,

39:53.391 --> 39:54.809
what are we gonna do with him?

39:56.394 --> 39:58.104
We're going to Washington, D.C.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.199
So how far are we from D.C.?

40:10.283 --> 40:11.951
Fifty miles. We could be there in an hour.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.119
And then what?

40:13.745 --> 40:14.871
What?

40:15.830 --> 40:18.207
Hey, Warren, how far down
the chain of command are you?

40:18.750 --> 40:20.043
Pretty damn far. Why?

40:20.126 --> 40:22.962
With President Jane dead,
seems like you could be next in line.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.131
No, brother. I got enough problems.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.967
President Warren.
I like the sound of that.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.093
-No.
-Got my vote.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.219
And knock it off.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.349
If anybody ask...

40:35.391 --> 40:37.560
We were nowhere near Mount Weather.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.023
Go for a ride? Come on.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.233
Good boy. Good boy.
