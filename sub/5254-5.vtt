00:01.142 --> 00:03.652
- From now on, I'll stay out of your life.
- Maybe that's for the best.

00:03.682 --> 00:05.683
I think you picked that fight
because you were jealous.

00:05.713 --> 00:07.740
Of Theo? Don't be ridiculous!

00:08.484 --> 00:10.211
Do I smell a show-mance?

00:10.538 --> 00:12.301
This morning, we had one
secret between us.

00:12.331 --> 00:14.123
- Now we have two.
- I know this will probably

00:14.125 --> 00:15.708
make everybody hate me,

00:15.738 --> 00:18.377
but I'm not really a lesbian.

00:20.630 --> 00:22.484
Have a great rest
of your day, Hesterians.

00:22.514 --> 00:24.005
And remember to take the High Road

00:24.035 --> 00:25.943
and give your best
wishes to Karma Ashcroft,

00:25.973 --> 00:27.859
'cause even someone that fakes lesbianism

00:27.889 --> 00:30.388
and offends an entire persecuted minority

00:30.418 --> 00:32.231
deserves a happy 16th birthday.

00:33.828 --> 00:35.937

00:36.106 --> 00:38.239
Hey there, my B-Day BFF.

00:38.509 --> 00:41.017
How sweet has 16 been?
Toothache inducing?

00:41.047 --> 00:43.221
Less sweet, more bitter,

00:43.251 --> 00:44.889
especially with you home sick.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.228
Maybe it's karma.

00:46.582 --> 00:49.595
Not... me, Karma. I mean "karma" Karma.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.203
I'm not following.

00:51.233 --> 00:52.100
(Sighs)

00:52.130 --> 00:53.698
I admitted to being a fake lesbian,

00:53.728 --> 00:55.073
and now I'm a pariah.

00:55.275 --> 00:57.848
Maybe the fates have also
placed a pox on your house.

00:57.878 --> 01:00.257
Okay, cliff-notes, it's not a pox.

01:00.287 --> 01:01.576
It's strep.

01:01.606 --> 01:02.967
And the only karma I believe in

01:02.997 --> 01:05.358
is the one who can eat
her weight in cake frosting.

01:05.388 --> 01:08.144

- People?
- Person. Singular.

01:17.034 --> 01:21.065
(Laughs) As in you, my
strep-stricken soul sister.

01:21.095 --> 01:24.744
Well, I promise I won't miss
any more milestone birthdays.

01:25.885 --> 01:27.914
For your 18th, we'll buy porn.

01:27.944 --> 01:29.862
And there's 21... that one's obvious.

01:30.166 --> 01:32.919
And for your 50th, Alaskan cruise.

01:32.921 --> 01:35.613
I'm thinking we'll be pretty
into whale watching by then.

01:35.643 --> 01:36.843
Where'd you go? Karma?

01:36.873 --> 01:39.481
I'm here. I just got to my locker.

01:49.137 --> 01:51.521
Amy! What are you doing here?

01:51.523 --> 01:54.779
I faked sick to set up your greatest
birthday scavenger hunt to date.

01:55.692 --> 01:57.198
What's up with the longing Liam looks?

01:57.228 --> 01:58.383
I thought you two were through.

01:58.413 --> 02:01.212
Oh, we are. Completely dunzo.

02:01.432 --> 02:04.151
- Trust me.
- (Laughs nervously)

02:04.842 --> 02:06.546
- Are you sure?
- Totally.

02:06.576 --> 02:08.205
And you didn't have to go
through all this trouble.

02:08.235 --> 02:09.872
I mean, after the week
that I've been having,

02:09.902 --> 02:11.521
I don't really feel like celebrating.

02:11.551 --> 02:13.502
You're a social leper, so what?

02:13.532 --> 02:16.007
Soon we'll go back to being
ignored like the good old days.

02:16.037 --> 02:17.155
All we need is each other.

02:17.185 --> 02:19.308
And to prove that point,

02:19.611 --> 02:22.195
I have recreated key
moments in our friendship.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.955
That's right... this hunt is
the best of Karmy retrospective.

02:25.985 --> 02:27.957
Has anyone ever told you
you're the best friend ever?

02:27.987 --> 02:29.435
Yeah.

02:29.739 --> 02:31.418
Let's do this.

02:33.674 --> 02:34.516
Uh...

02:34.546 --> 02:36.057
Today is your day.

02:36.087 --> 02:38.310
I'm not gonna let you carry your book-bag

02:38.340 --> 02:39.890
like some sort of commoner.

02:40.750 --> 02:44.273
Now here, open your first clue.

02:45.605 --> 02:48.327
Yay, I... can't wait to read it.

02:54.462 --> 02:55.322
Liam.

02:55.352 --> 02:57.587
Quit taking it out on these
innocent art supplies...

02:57.589 --> 02:59.388
Shane, really, I don't
want to talk about it.

02:59.418 --> 03:01.543
That's just your straight guy resistance

03:01.573 --> 03:03.398
to talking about your feelings.

03:03.428 --> 03:04.379
Push through it.

03:04.409 --> 03:05.889
- What are y'all on about?
- (Sighs)

03:05.919 --> 03:08.714
It's Karma's birthday, and Liam
can't be with her for reasons

03:08.744 --> 03:11.856
too complicated and
(bleep) up to specify.

03:11.886 --> 03:14.075
Wanna go hit stuff?
Always makes me feel better.

03:14.105 --> 03:15.688
I'm taking this mixed martial
arts class downtown.

03:15.690 --> 03:19.170
Nice try, Theo, but what Liam
needs is to talk it all out

03:19.200 --> 03:21.546
over some grilled
cheeses at Millie's Diner.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.815
What is this,<i> The View?</i>

03:22.845 --> 03:25.114
(Both laughing)

03:26.108 --> 03:29.141
Shane, I'm sorry, but that class
is just what the doctor ordered.

03:29.171 --> 03:31.414
You're not the doctor.
You're the patient.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.899
You can't prescribe your own medicine.

03:32.929 --> 03:36.127
Wow, you really think you know
what's best for everybody, don't you?

03:36.157 --> 03:37.681
- It's a gift.
- (Scoffs)

03:39.041 --> 03:40.193
We'll talk it out later, I promise.

03:40.223 --> 03:41.515
But right now, I just want to punch

03:41.545 --> 03:43.544
someone in the face
without getting arrested.

03:43.574 --> 03:45.131
You want to come?

03:45.161 --> 03:46.314
I'll pass.

03:46.344 --> 03:49.403
It all sounds a bit too aggressively
heterosexual for me.

03:54.812 --> 03:56.797
- Ahh!
- Hey, watch it!

03:56.827 --> 03:59.772
Lurk much, Lauren?
What are you doing here?

03:59.802 --> 04:02.221
You're opposed to arts education.

04:02.251 --> 04:05.257
We should not waste tax dollars on
people who don't want real jobs.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.738
And I needed a... sponge for...

04:09.125 --> 04:10.543
sponging.

04:10.573 --> 04:11.777
Uh-huh.

04:11.779 --> 04:15.487
Or you know Theo meets us
after school here most days,

04:15.517 --> 04:17.500
and you are full-on stalking him.

04:17.502 --> 04:19.605
- That is ridiculous.
- Is it?

04:19.635 --> 04:21.226
Is it, really?

04:22.119 --> 04:24.489
Fine, maybe I was thinking
we might bump...

04:24.519 --> 04:27.125
- Uglies?
- Into each other.

04:27.155 --> 04:28.354
I like him, okay?

04:28.384 --> 04:30.051
So you better not screw it up.

04:30.081 --> 04:33.397
Trust me, I won't. I am all
for you two mating.

04:33.427 --> 04:34.822
- You are?
- A high-maintenance,

04:34.852 --> 04:37.986
time-consuming girlfriend
is exactly what Theo needs.

04:37.988 --> 04:39.321
Right? Okay.

04:39.323 --> 04:41.594
So how can we make this happen?

04:43.694 --> 04:45.527
Amy, this is amazing!

04:45.529 --> 04:47.689
It's just like that ball pit where
we met in kindergarten.

04:47.719 --> 04:48.801
And you know what?

04:48.831 --> 04:50.824
I don't even care that my room's
gonna reek of toddler feet

04:50.854 --> 04:52.307
- for the next month.
- You better get to searching.

04:52.337 --> 04:54.119
- We don't have all day.
- Right.

04:54.121 --> 04:55.516
- Wait... what?
- Your next clue's

04:55.546 --> 04:58.957
written on one of these
balls, so start digging!

04:58.959 --> 05:00.824
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

05:01.246 --> 05:03.045
Uh...Fun! Ha.

05:03.299 --> 05:04.596
Here goes.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.525
I may have underestimated
how long this would take.

05:10.555 --> 05:12.581
I'll help.

05:19.901 --> 05:20.862
Hey!

05:22.579 --> 05:23.405
What's that?

05:23.435 --> 05:26.151
Uh, just a... birthday note

05:26.153 --> 05:28.153
from Irma.

05:30.086 --> 05:32.386
- Irma the lunch lady?
- What can I say?

05:32.416 --> 05:34.209
She is a fan.

05:34.211 --> 05:35.577
On my birthday, she just gave me

05:35.579 --> 05:37.379
an extra scoop of mashed potatoes.

05:37.381 --> 05:38.921
But you know the rules....

05:38.951 --> 05:41.466
We open gifts and cards after cake time.

05:41.468 --> 05:43.001
- Of course!
- Now, come on.

05:43.003 --> 05:45.453
This clue ball ain't gonna find itself.

05:50.427 --> 05:51.678
(Guys grunting)

05:51.708 --> 05:53.965
So when does the punching
of things commence?

05:53.995 --> 05:56.765
Patience, young Padawan.
First there's warm-ups.

05:56.767 --> 06:00.407
Great! We're so ready to bust
some skulls and whatnot.

06:00.437 --> 06:02.262
Well, well, well. Look who it is.

06:02.292 --> 06:04.323
You two came together? Are you...

06:04.325 --> 06:05.607
- Friends now?
- What?

06:05.609 --> 06:06.897
- Eew! No.
- Don't be gross.

06:06.927 --> 06:09.075
I just ran into Lauren here,
and it just so happens

06:09.105 --> 06:11.263
she's in the mood to whack
on someone herself

06:11.265 --> 06:12.681
or was it whack off, Lauren?

06:12.683 --> 06:13.932
Whack on, whack off, whack on...

06:13.934 --> 06:15.416
- I'm looking to...
- Ow!

06:15.446 --> 06:17.019
Mix up my workout regime.

06:17.021 --> 06:18.953
Yoga-lates is getting old.

06:18.983 --> 06:21.974
I'm gonna go... stretch.

06:21.976 --> 06:24.189
(Gasps) I saw that!

06:24.219 --> 06:26.445
You've got a thing for the ice queen!

06:26.447 --> 06:28.121
You two would be so cute together.

06:28.151 --> 06:30.582
Plus, if he melts her heart,
you'll save all the villagers!

06:30.612 --> 06:32.503
There you go thinking you're right again.

06:32.533 --> 06:35.610
- Seriously, butt out.
- And butt joke in three,

06:35.640 --> 06:37.289
- two, and one.
- Please!

06:37.291 --> 06:38.746
Butt jokes are beneath me.

06:38.776 --> 06:40.359
But speaking of butts...

06:40.361 --> 06:43.012
- (Guys grunting)
- I was so wrong about one thing.

06:43.042 --> 06:44.491
This class isn't too straight.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.662
This is the gayest thing I have ever seen!

06:46.692 --> 06:49.009
- What? No it isn't!
- Uh... Come on!

06:49.039 --> 06:51.827
Half-naked, sweaty men,
colorful short-shorts,

06:51.857 --> 06:54.118
positions straight out
of a Sean Cody film.

06:54.148 --> 06:55.500
You're crazy! Back me up, Liam.

06:55.530 --> 06:57.639
You are talking to the undisputed expert

06:57.669 --> 06:59.843
of finding homoerotic subtext in anything.

06:59.873 --> 07:01.597
Do not get him started on Batman.

07:01.599 --> 07:04.184
He and Alfred live in a
cave and design outfits.

07:04.214 --> 07:07.491
Okay, I'll give you that one.
But MMA is not gay... in any way.

07:07.521 --> 07:09.614
- Ooh!
- Take it!

07:09.644 --> 07:11.440
All right, huddle up, class.

07:11.442 --> 07:13.976
I'm your instructor, Duke Lewis Junior.

07:13.978 --> 07:15.394
My father owns this gym.

07:15.396 --> 07:17.329
Kinda like how I'm about to own...

07:17.359 --> 07:18.906
All your asses.

07:18.936 --> 07:20.680
- Who's ready?
- (Claps)

07:22.987 --> 07:24.360
Wow, you really went all out.

07:24.390 --> 07:27.044
I mean, painting ceramic
figurines from our unicorn period

07:27.074 --> 07:29.202
and then sneaking into that PG-13 movie?

07:29.232 --> 07:31.326
That was so us when we were ten.

07:31.328 --> 07:33.314
But did we really have
to stay for the whole thing?

07:33.753 --> 07:36.331
We're not cutting corners
on your birthday!

07:39.643 --> 07:41.509
- Surprise.
- Surprise!

07:41.539 --> 07:42.356
Mom...

07:42.386 --> 07:44.615
- And Aunt Sarah.
- You know my sister

07:44.645 --> 07:46.625
prefers her chosen name:

07:46.627 --> 07:50.101
Your psychic Aunt Sage has come
all the way from Sedona

07:50.131 --> 07:53.354
- to read your tea leaves.
- Wow. Just like when we were 13.

07:53.384 --> 07:56.812
Mm-hmm. Gather forth, spirit sisters.

07:56.842 --> 07:58.713
A divination is just what you need.

07:58.743 --> 08:01.106
That, and one of my
♪ magic brownies! ♪

08:01.108 --> 08:02.558
(Gasps) Ooh!

08:02.862 --> 08:04.448
Oh, wait. (Sniffs)

08:04.650 --> 08:07.279
Just making sure they're not
your father's magic brownies.

08:07.281 --> 08:09.346
- Mm!
- So after tea drinkin'

08:09.376 --> 08:12.405
and fortune tellin', is it time
for cake eatin' and card openin'?

08:12.435 --> 08:13.804
Hey, no spoilers.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.405
Just relax and live in the now.

08:16.407 --> 08:18.369
- (Mouthing words)
- Right.

08:24.185 --> 08:25.380
Oh, that's hot!

08:25.382 --> 08:26.832
Interesting.

08:26.834 --> 08:30.558
It appears the universe has
a very important message for you

08:30.588 --> 08:33.337
about your one true love.

08:35.739 --> 08:37.913
Well, tell the universe I can't
wait to find out what it says.

08:37.943 --> 08:39.178
(Gasps) Not so fast.

08:39.179 --> 08:42.212
A force is trying to keep
the message from you,

08:42.241 --> 08:45.400
standing between you and your love.

08:45.841 --> 08:48.347
Well, what could it be? They're
sitting right next to other.

08:48.377 --> 08:50.291
Whatever it is, act now

08:50.321 --> 08:51.960
before it's too late.

08:53.444 --> 08:56.467
Wow! Well, that tea really
shot right through me.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.364
I have to visit the little
birthday girl's room.

08:59.366 --> 09:00.833
Excuse me.

09:01.325 --> 09:03.669
Mind if I borrow this?
It's a little drafty in there.

09:03.671 --> 09:05.021
Okay.

09:09.427 --> 09:11.971
- (Bleep)!
- Honey, whatcha looking for?

09:12.001 --> 09:13.462
I can't find that note.

09:13.464 --> 09:15.848
- Oh, who's it from?
- Irma.

09:15.850 --> 09:18.565
- Irma the lunch lady?
- Apparently, she's a fan.

09:18.595 --> 09:20.436
- Aw!
- It must have slipped out!

09:20.466 --> 09:21.386
Where could it be?

09:21.388 --> 09:23.155
(Sighs) No telling.

09:23.661 --> 09:27.068
But I doubt Irma wrote much
more than "happy birthday."

09:27.456 --> 09:29.413
She has a poet's soul.

09:29.884 --> 09:33.065
Come on, we have to retrace
our steps until we find it.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.118
Bye.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.558
This isn't making me feel any better.

09:38.588 --> 09:39.838
That's because I'm right.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.289
Those grilled cheeses are calling us.

09:41.291 --> 09:43.188
Or we need to skip this lame warm up

09:43.218 --> 09:45.042
and get to the part where we
get to whale on something.

09:45.072 --> 09:47.545
Remember, keep those abs tight.

09:48.141 --> 09:49.714
Those abs!

09:50.163 --> 09:51.571
- I knew it!
- Knew what?

09:51.601 --> 09:52.612
Switch!

09:56.135 --> 09:57.208
Still think this is gay?

09:57.238 --> 10:00.355
Oh, this gay-ole-time
just got even gayer.

10:00.385 --> 10:03.776
Our instructor is queerer than
Neil Patrick Harris at the tonys.

10:03.806 --> 10:06.144
Duke Lewis is the best
junior division MMA fighter

10:06.174 --> 10:07.899
in the state... He could
go pro any minute.

10:07.901 --> 10:10.198
- And he couldn't also be gay?
- He also has a rep

10:10.228 --> 10:12.941
as a total hound dog. One
that chases the pussy-cat,

10:12.971 --> 10:14.420
not the rooster.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.203
Care to make things interesting?

10:16.233 --> 10:17.705
50 bucks interesting enough?

10:17.735 --> 10:21.072
Done. Oh, and P.S., I've seen
Duke's abs all over stubble.

10:21.392 --> 10:22.737
The gay hook-up app!

10:22.767 --> 10:25.224
And I've got a photographic
memory for torsos!

10:25.254 --> 10:26.467
Switch!

10:30.898 --> 10:32.848
All right. Nice toss.

10:32.878 --> 10:34.696
There's more to you than meets the eye.

10:34.726 --> 10:35.971
What's that supposed to mean?

10:36.001 --> 10:38.752
You're so dainty and
fragile and feminine.

10:38.782 --> 10:40.337
But really, you... ooh!

10:40.367 --> 10:41.896
I'm what?

10:41.926 --> 10:44.451
Okay! Warm-ups are over.

10:44.453 --> 10:47.008
Now I need a brave volunteer
to help demonstrate

10:47.038 --> 10:48.926
some basic fighting holds with me.

10:48.956 --> 10:50.467
Any takers?

10:51.584 --> 10:53.627
See what you got, pretty boy.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.423
We're never gonna find it, Karma.

10:57.453 --> 10:58.518
Let's get back to the hunt.

10:58.548 --> 11:00.878
We only got three stops
left until cake time.

11:00.908 --> 11:02.125
Five more minutes!

11:02.155 --> 11:04.671
Had to be in the ball pit, of all places.

11:04.994 --> 11:07.118
I can't believe I didn't
think of this earlier.

11:07.148 --> 11:10.202
Why don't we just call Irma
and ask her what it said?

11:10.762 --> 11:12.179
Wait. You have Irma's number?

11:12.181 --> 11:13.577
Of course. Up until a few months ago,

11:13.607 --> 11:16.038
she was our only friend, remember?

11:16.421 --> 11:19.134
Maybe she'll finally give me
that oatmeal cookie recipe.

11:19.164 --> 11:20.685
Wait, wait...

11:20.988 --> 11:23.162
It's not from Irma.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.831
- It's from Liam.
- Finally.

11:25.861 --> 11:27.632
- The truth comes out.
- You knew?

11:27.662 --> 11:29.182
I've known this whole time.

11:29.212 --> 11:31.289
I saw you two having
eye sex in the courtyard.

11:31.319 --> 11:34.262
I've barely seen him. I don't
even know what it says.

11:34.292 --> 11:37.287
Here. Now you can find out.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.157
You've had it? I can't believe

11:40.159 --> 11:43.093
- you would keep this from me.
- Well, now you know how it feels.

11:43.123 --> 11:44.458
Today was supposed to be about us,

11:44.488 --> 11:45.718
but here he is, Liam Booker,

11:45.748 --> 11:47.235
just when I thought
we moved past all that.

11:47.265 --> 11:48.604
Are you serious?

11:48.634 --> 11:51.205
We just spent four hours
reliving our past.

11:51.235 --> 11:53.372
You two are banging behind
my back again, aren't you?

11:53.402 --> 11:54.788
What? No, we're not.

11:54.818 --> 11:56.155
You're probably telling Irma all about it.

11:56.185 --> 11:58.970
I swear, there's nothing
going on between us.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.577
- I chose you.
- Chose me?

12:01.607 --> 12:02.723
What the hell are you talking about?

12:02.753 --> 12:06.299
I knew I couldn't be with Liam and
keep our friendship, so I chose you!

12:06.329 --> 12:08.395
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

12:09.004 --> 12:12.523
What more do I have to do
to prove it to you, Amy?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.632
There. Are you happy?

12:27.905 --> 12:31.565
Oh! I didn't expect you
to be back so soon.

12:31.595 --> 12:32.862
You and Karma don't usually finish

12:32.892 --> 12:34.916
her birthday scavenger
hunt until midnight.

12:34.946 --> 12:37.169
- We had a really bad fight.
- Was this a...

12:37.199 --> 12:39.437
Friend fight or a...

12:39.467 --> 12:41.704
More than friends fight?
I'm still not really clear

12:41.734 --> 12:44.450
- on the whole...
- Mom, Karma loves guys.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.420
And you?

12:45.450 --> 12:49.254
I love Karma. That's the whole problem.

12:49.624 --> 12:51.616
Oh, honey...

12:51.936 --> 12:56.603
I once fell for a guy who,
shall we say, didn't catch me.

12:56.633 --> 12:58.658
It hurt like a bitch.

12:58.688 --> 13:00.138
How'd you get over it?

13:00.744 --> 13:03.313
I bought new boobs, which helped, but...

13:03.579 --> 13:05.732
Mainly it just took time.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.569
I had to give up my fantasy
of us being together.

13:10.647 --> 13:13.595
Want me to set up a consultation
with my plastic surgeon?

13:14.326 --> 13:15.927
Absolutely not.

13:16.590 --> 13:17.896
- Yeah!
- Come on, dude.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.412
Take him, dude.

13:21.637 --> 13:23.777
- Ugh!
- Now, the sprawl

13:23.807 --> 13:26.486
is your most basic defense
position in your arsenal.

13:26.516 --> 13:28.052
Ooh, I can feel your stubble.

13:28.082 --> 13:30.704
Speaking of, how
you doing, "str8shootr95"?

13:30.734 --> 13:32.044
What are you talking about, dude?

13:32.364 --> 13:35.660
All right, now we're gonna move on
to some more advanced positions.

13:35.690 --> 13:38.167
Booker, I need a word. Several, actually.

13:38.197 --> 13:39.317
Oh. Yeah, sure. What's up?

13:39.347 --> 13:42.338
Did you tell Theo about my... you know,

13:42.368 --> 13:43.395
My secret thing?

13:43.425 --> 13:44.959
What? No!

13:44.989 --> 13:47.450
No! I have nothing against you, Lauren.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.768
Well, aside from that time

13:48.798 --> 13:51.436
when you rallied all my former
hookups to publically humiliate me.

13:51.466 --> 13:52.696
Oh.

13:52.698 --> 13:56.768
Okay. Then I'm gonna need you to flirt
with me to make Theo jealous. Come on.

13:56.798 --> 13:58.079
Make it raunchy. I want
you to really commit.

13:58.109 --> 14:01.180
(Laughs) Yeah... I'm not gonna do that.

14:01.210 --> 14:04.667
Take it from me... lies and schemes,
they just mess up everything.

14:04.697 --> 14:05.959
You're lucky that the only thing

14:05.961 --> 14:09.657
standing in the way of you
and what you want... is you.

14:13.158 --> 14:15.301
- Take him, dude.
- Come on, dude.

14:15.553 --> 14:18.112
Now, when you find yourself on all fours

14:18.142 --> 14:20.626
and a guy comes at you from behind...

14:24.136 --> 14:26.801
Hey, you weren't kidding when
you said you were versatile.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.075
What?

14:29.391 --> 14:30.536
Come on, I know it's you.

14:30.566 --> 14:34.654
I know from the tat on
your hip... right here!

14:35.142 --> 14:37.636
What the (bleep), dude? Not cool!

14:38.558 --> 14:40.710
- Uhh!
- Oh!

14:41.485 --> 14:43.070
I don't know what'll hurt worse...

14:43.100 --> 14:45.126
That body slam or you
forking over that 50.

14:45.156 --> 14:47.550
I'll take cash, check, or Paypal.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.066
I got your text.

15:04.101 --> 15:05.268
Ta-Da!

15:06.044 --> 15:07.521
This is the last station.

15:07.551 --> 15:10.975
It's supposed to represent
our future as best friends...

15:11.005 --> 15:13.001
Two houses next to each other.

15:13.031 --> 15:15.069
But I'm starting to realize

15:15.099 --> 15:18.722
that other people will probably
live in them with us.

15:19.379 --> 15:21.834
Amy, I promise there's
nothing going on...

15:21.864 --> 15:25.663
Please stop. I'm trying to apologize.

15:25.693 --> 15:27.910
I should have never kept
that note from you.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.170
I'll be honest.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.722
Part of me wants to keep
you all for myself.

15:31.752 --> 15:33.847
But another part of me
wants to see you happy.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.573
It's... it's a real struggle in here.

15:38.588 --> 15:39.969
The good side won out.

15:40.734 --> 15:42.840
(Sniffles) This is your last clue.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.322
I did my best.

15:48.642 --> 15:50.600
Uh, Amy,

15:51.915 --> 15:53.900
just got your text.

15:54.484 --> 15:56.966
- What's going on?
- You're right on time.

15:56.996 --> 15:58.788
This is my gift.

16:00.858 --> 16:02.929
- Your what?
- Look, you two are clearly

16:02.959 --> 16:05.558
crazy about each other
for whatever reason.

16:07.509 --> 16:11.233
And you can't stop your feelings
any more than I can stop mine.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.311
The only thing keeping you apart...

16:14.341 --> 16:16.139
Is me.

16:16.169 --> 16:17.590

16:31.731 --> 16:34.191
Happy birthday, Karma.

16:46.944 --> 16:49.622
Well, I'm guessing I should
start by reading your note.

16:49.624 --> 16:51.174
(Both laugh)

16:54.800 --> 16:57.982
(Chuckles) Or you could
just tell me what it says.

16:58.012 --> 16:59.265
It says...

17:00.014 --> 17:01.846
Happy birthday.

17:01.876 --> 17:03.229
Seriously?

17:04.173 --> 17:06.867
I rewrote it a million times
and then I figured...

17:07.321 --> 17:08.692
Keep it simple.

17:08.722 --> 17:11.492
So are we really gonna give this a shot?

So, uh, what's going on with us?

17:42.139 --> 17:43.677
I mean, do you like me or not?

17:43.707 --> 17:46.587
Because I might sort of possibly
might be considering

17:46.617 --> 17:48.912
liking you. On a trial basis.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.905
Well, yeah.

that and then just leave?

- Hey.

18:26.508 --> 18:27.688
I thought you were with Liam.

18:27.718 --> 18:29.773
We have a date planned for this weekend.

18:29.803 --> 18:32.400
But there are 15 minutes
left to my birthday,

18:32.402 --> 18:34.379
and I want to spend them with you.

18:34.699 --> 18:36.488
Besides, where is my real present?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.623
(Laughs)

18:39.338 --> 18:41.031
You know in sixth grade

18:41.061 --> 18:42.977
the clown machine at the Downtown Arcade?

18:43.007 --> 18:45.975
We emptied our piggy
banks to try to win those...

18:46.005 --> 18:47.286
You didn't.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.168

18:51.098 --> 18:52.699
- You did!
- (Laughs)

18:55.192 --> 18:56.808
It must have taken you
forever to get these.

18:56.810 --> 19:00.475
Oh, just 13 hours and... 26 minutes.

19:00.505 --> 19:02.984
I promise to always wear mine

19:03.253 --> 19:05.274
as long as you do too.

19:06.315 --> 19:09.159
Or at least until the cheap fake
gold turns your skin green.

- Or that.

19:29.071 --> 19:30.615
What I did was uncalled for.

19:30.645 --> 19:32.279
You know, even if I was gay,

19:32.309 --> 19:34.803
what you did was completely out of line.

19:35.191 --> 19:37.591
You're right. You're so totally right.

19:39.442 --> 19:40.740
So were you.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.069
Huh?

19:44.276 --> 19:46.057

to keep things discreet.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.519
Right.

20:08.048 --> 20:11.388
Wait, I'm sorry. I can't date
someone who's still in the closet.

20:11.676 --> 20:13.867
Who said anything about dating?
