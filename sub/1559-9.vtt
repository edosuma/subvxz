WEBVTT

00:04.437 --> 00:06.705
This is Victor Finch,

00:06.707 --> 00:09.608
recording live for
the u-f-ology videocast.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.177
It's day three of my search here
in the town of Collins falls

00:12.179 --> 00:14.513
and I've seen no sign
of the mysterious lights

00:14.515 --> 00:16.215
- reported in the sky.
- ( Electricity crackling )

00:16.216 --> 00:18.484
Now, although the reports
aren't frequent,

00:18.486 --> 00:21.353
they are consistent, which
rules out the possibility

00:21.355 --> 00:24.156
of a freak accident
or a misunderstanding.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.238
Reports are only an am-1
on the Vallée scale.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.274
That means lights
but no contact.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.542
I'm hoping to catch some more

00:43.544 --> 00:45.144
of those weird
energy traces before...

00:45.146 --> 00:46.779
( Crackling continues )

00:55.755 --> 00:57.723
( Screeching )

01:03.063 --> 01:05.564
Run! They're here!

01:05.566 --> 01:08.801
Run! Run!

01:08.803 --> 01:11.537
It's an invasion!

01:11.539 --> 01:13.372
Run!

01:25.452 --> 01:28.454
Is there a problem, sweetheart?

01:28.456 --> 01:31.223
Something's out
there in the woods.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.126
It's not an am-1 anymore,
it's a ce-3.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.328
Close encounter of the third...

01:41.334 --> 01:43.235
Kind.

01:44.737 --> 01:46.705
( Roaring )

02:08.627 --> 02:10.461
I'm telling you, it's aliens.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.831
There are no such
things as ufos.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.801
Minotaur's, haunted houses,
Santa claus, yes,

02:15.803 --> 02:18.504
but ufos, don't be silly.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.706
A UFO nut goes missing in a town

02:20.708 --> 02:22.674
where strange lights
have been reported.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.843
U.F.O.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.679
Do not be deceived by
any physical manifestation

02:27.681 --> 02:31.383
you may encounter,
they're absolutely not ufos.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.285
The only people I know
that believe in ufos

02:33.287 --> 02:35.187
are the same ones that
think that Elvis

02:35.189 --> 02:36.755
was the shooter
on the grassy knoll.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.457
Look, current estimates
put the number

02:38.459 --> 02:41.293
of habitable planets in
our galaxy at 11 billion.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.895
So it is highly unlikely
that we are the only

02:42.897 --> 02:44.429
intelligent life
in this universe.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.265
I'll tell you what.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.766
We'll just fill in the crack
you're about to make

02:47.768 --> 02:49.368
about us and intelligent life,
just skip right to the job.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.702
Are you sure?
It was quite cutting.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.605
I promise to be
properly offended.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.674
I mean, I probably wouldn't have
even understood it at first.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.510
But I'll be offended later.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.346
Where's the fun in that?

03:01.348 --> 03:05.284
The Vallée scale is how we
measure inter-planetary contact

03:05.286 --> 03:06.919
using the degree of
physical evidence remaining on--

03:06.921 --> 03:08.587
you're a UFO geek.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.522
No, I'm sorry, it's just
you've never really,

03:10.524 --> 03:11.924
like, geeked out
about anything before.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.959
Well, I just think
that if a super intelligent

03:13.961 --> 03:16.795
powerful alien race arrives,
we should be prepared.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.765
You're planning on selling out
the human race, aren't you?

03:19.767 --> 03:23.502
I will absolutely sell out the human
race to our new alien overlords.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.305
don't fight them,
they know what's best for us.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.809
So what's the plan, baird?

03:30.811 --> 03:32.744
We don't have
a lot to go on here.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.214
Independent journalist
Victor Finch went missing.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.815
Was abducted by aliens.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.417
I will break every
bone in your body.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.985
Hey, when did you say
this town was founded?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.687
1953.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.788
Huh.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.289
Why?

03:44.291 --> 03:45.624
Nine out of ten homes
built in the 50s

03:45.626 --> 03:46.959
were ranch style architecture.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.560
These are like colonial
revival which would

03:48.562 --> 03:50.562
put them on late 18,
early 1900s.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.598
Maybe they wanted a more
old-fashioned nostalgic look.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.299
Yeah, that would
explain the gas lamps.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.535
Well, follow your instincts,
if you think something

03:56.537 --> 03:58.337
is off about the town you
and Cassandra see

03:58.339 --> 03:59.638
what you can learn
about its history.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.340
Find out if these lights
are a new thing,

04:01.342 --> 04:02.975
if there's a history
of disappearances.

04:02.977 --> 04:04.610
Jones and I
will check out the spot

04:04.612 --> 04:05.944
where the victim's
truck was found.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.346
- All right.
- Okay.

04:19.492 --> 04:20.591
Excuse me, ma'am.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.762
Ma'am?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.597
I don't get a lot of
ma'aming around here.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.899
Mostly just,
"hey, Mabel."

04:27.901 --> 04:29.534
Mabel.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.936
That's an old-fashioned name.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.405
Ah, well,
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.573
It's an old-fashioned town.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.441
Oh, these things?

04:36.443 --> 04:37.943
Yeah, they haven't worked
in forever but I like

04:37.945 --> 04:39.845
to tinker around with
them from time to time.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.847
It'd be a sight to see them
all lit up, wouldn't it?

04:41.849 --> 04:43.749
Yes, it would.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.850
It'd look like Paris.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.919
Oui, comme Paris.

04:47.921 --> 04:51.456
Oh, well, mais ici,
dans Collins falls.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.025
Mabel Collins.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.560
Jacob, Jacob stone.

04:55.562 --> 04:58.730
- This is Cassandra cillian.
- Hi.

04:58.732 --> 05:02.801
Listen, we're the--
we're the librarians.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.739
Yeah, we're doing some research
on town histories, so...

05:07.741 --> 05:09.408
Ah, that makes sense.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.343
- Yeah.
- For once.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.345
Is there someone
we could talk to about it?

05:13.347 --> 05:17.416
- I would recommend the town archivist.
- Okay.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.918
Family founded the place, so if they
don't know it, it ain't worth knowing.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.321
All right, can you
point us in his direction?

05:25.358 --> 05:26.558
- Mabel Collins...
- Mm.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.093
Collins falls,
you're the archivist?

05:28.095 --> 05:30.696
Brains, too.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.368
I'm the archivist, notary,

05:36.370 --> 05:40.339
volunteer fire chief and
chancellor of the exchequer.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.541
Well, technically, treasurer
but since I ordered

05:42.543 --> 05:45.811
the business cards, too,
who's going to stop me?

05:45.813 --> 05:46.978
Not a lot of town
government, huh?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.413
Not a lot of town.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.382
Not much interesting
around here.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.452
Et pourtant, je suis interesse.

05:53.454 --> 05:56.021
( Sighs ) We should probably ask
about that local history stuff.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.457
Je pense que vous etes
interessant.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.925
Or, like, anything at all.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.661
Just...

06:02.663 --> 06:06.631
I was kind of hoping
there'd be crop circles.

06:06.633 --> 06:10.402
This looks like where
they found the truck.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.571
Why park all the way back here?

06:12.573 --> 06:14.139
Most hikers would park
closer to the roads

06:14.141 --> 06:16.475
so if they get lost
someone will notice sooner.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.009
don't ask me.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.612
I don't even get
why people go hiking.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.881
He didn't want anyone
to know he was here.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.485
Or someone else moved the truck.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.986
( Rustling )

06:54.580 --> 06:57.482
Who put a gas lamp
in the middle of the woods?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.752
Victor Finch?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.521
( Roars )

07:04.157 --> 07:07.125
( Electricity crackling )

07:18.638 --> 07:21.840
Only you people could
lose a guardian.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.575
Librarians, yes,

07:23.577 --> 07:25.477
we go through them
like tissue paper,

07:25.479 --> 07:26.478
but a guardian?

07:26.480 --> 07:27.479
Okay.
It wasn't even me.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.914
This cat right here.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.882
I'd prefer to think of it
as she lost me.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.851
I mean, one minute
she's all assault and battery

07:32.853 --> 07:34.820
and the next she's
beamed up into space.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.488
Or you ran. You have no
idea what happened.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.622
So you came up with
the story to cover.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.925
I can see how you think
that but no.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.626
No one beamed her anywhere.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.562
Say's the guy with
the teleporting door.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.863
Ufos do not exist.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.032
Say's the guy with
the teleporting door.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.233
- ( Pinging )
- Ah, look, see, there.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.203
Col. Baird is
still on the planet.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.237
She's alive? She's safe?

07:52.239 --> 07:54.773
She's still on the planet.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.874
That narrows it down.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.075
Magic is not an exact science.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.578
If it were, it would be science.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.846
Okay. So we assume that this
is another disappearance.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.514
Then whatever happened
to col. Baird

08:02.516 --> 08:04.216
is the same thing that
happened to Victor Finch.

08:04.218 --> 08:05.684
It seems like
a reasonable assumption.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.918
Only now, that
we found Victor Finch.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.919
We got a witness.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.254
Yes.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.158
I'm telling you,
I don't remember anything.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.860
What's the last thing
you do remember?

08:14.862 --> 08:17.162
I remember being in the woods.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.731
I've been looking
for the am-1.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.766
Oh, that means lights
but no contact.

08:21.768 --> 08:22.834
Yeah, yeah, what next?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.136
Then nothing.

08:25.138 --> 08:29.908
It feels like the whole
last day is just gone.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.977
Mr. Finch, you've been
missing for three weeks.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.913
What?

08:39.919 --> 08:43.087
As requested,
there's UFO equipment.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.891
Why are you interested
in that stuff?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.726
I thought you said
ufos were a crock.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.094
They are.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.762
But the fools that chase them

08:50.764 --> 08:54.633
can sometimes come up
with something interesting.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.101
See?

08:56.103 --> 08:59.604
These goggles, they're
some sort of aura filter.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.607
There's an energy emission right
behind him there in the woods.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.809
That's the clearing with the gas
lamp where baird disappeared.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.545
We need to know more
about those gas lamps.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.879
Okay. Someone should go back
and talk to that town archivist.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.648
- Oh, oh.
- Which should probably be me.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.916
- Oh, I could-- I could...
- No, you want to take this?

09:10.918 --> 09:12.284
- No, I'll go--I'll go.
- You sure?

09:12.286 --> 09:13.852
- I could come help.
- You guys keep busy.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.220
- Do you want me to send Jones?
- No, no, no, no.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.855
Okay. He's got it.

09:19.258 --> 09:21.059
Hello.

09:21.061 --> 09:25.163
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.066
Boy, this is a hell of an archive
you got here for a small town.

09:28.068 --> 09:32.737
Well, you know, small towns. God help
you if you ever throw anything away.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.939
Yeah.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.974
Help you, Mr. ma'am?

09:35.976 --> 09:39.010
Please tell me you've
taking that for a spin.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.346
Me? No.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.781
I've never left town.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.182
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.617
Family obligations.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.019
Well, family ain't easy.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.322
No, it ain't.

09:50.324 --> 09:53.158
Never even been down the
highway to New York City.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.094
You travel?

09:56.096 --> 09:59.030
Well, I got a new job,
gets me out a little bit.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.832
- Okay.
- Up until a couple of months ago, though,

10:00.834 --> 10:02.133
I've never been more
than a tank of gas

10:02.135 --> 10:03.802
away from my parents'
front porch

10:03.804 --> 10:06.671
'less it was digging
ditches out somewhere.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.306
So what is it
about the gas lamps?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.108
You wanna bring Paris here

10:10.110 --> 10:12.277
or you wanna make it
feel like you're there?

10:13.846 --> 10:16.247
don't get me wrong,
it's a nice town,

10:16.249 --> 10:18.717
just I've got a whole warehouse

10:18.719 --> 10:20.819
full of memories of this place.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.654
It'd sure be nice
to have at least

10:22.656 --> 10:26.257
one wall of memories
of somewhere else.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.059
Anything else.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.095
No, I know what you mean.
Like not having a story

10:30.097 --> 10:32.263
that doesn't start off, "you
remember that night at Jimmy's bar?"

10:32.265 --> 10:34.733
Or "remember that waitress?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.134
Oh, yeah, you remember
her because

10:36.136 --> 10:38.336
we go to that diner
every weekend."

10:38.338 --> 10:40.639
"You remember what happened
at the town barbecue?"

10:40.641 --> 10:42.140
"Oh, which one, that one?"
"No, the other one?"

10:42.142 --> 10:43.241
"That one?
"No, the other one"--

10:43.243 --> 10:45.410
- hey.
- ( Laughs )

10:47.647 --> 10:51.850
Yeah, just once,
I wanna be able to say...

10:54.387 --> 10:56.154
Remember that waiter,

10:56.156 --> 11:01.393
that little cafe of Pont Neuf?

11:01.395 --> 11:05.030
Remember when the car
broke down in Moscow?

11:05.032 --> 11:10.101
What was the name of that
hotel we stayed at in Athens?

11:16.976 --> 11:20.045
Remember the view
from the Eiffel Tower?

11:20.047 --> 11:24.282
It was raining, but the
lights made everything glow.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.022
Well, I,

11:31.024 --> 11:35.927
I don't have quite
the imagination you do.

11:35.929 --> 11:40.732
No, I made my choices and
I can't pretend otherwise.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.735
Oh, it's-- sorry,

11:43.737 --> 11:45.837
this just must seem
pretty silly, I didn't...

11:45.839 --> 11:49.074
No, no, no, I just--
I can't.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.742
Oh, okay.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.976
But it was, you know,
the reason I came

11:51.978 --> 11:54.312
is because we have
some surveying equipment

11:54.314 --> 11:55.914
that picked up some
weird readings

11:55.916 --> 11:57.382
off one of your gas lamps
in the forest.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.784
Show me.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.453
Well, if I actually-- I could
just see-- can I see some plans?

12:01.455 --> 12:03.822
My town, my archives.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.057
- Yes. Sure.
- Show me.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.093
Um...

12:11.197 --> 12:12.297
Watch your step.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.798
Thanks.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.900
Hey, Mabel, you
remember Cassandra?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.369
This is Jenkins.
This is Ezekiel.

12:18.371 --> 12:23.174
You brought someone who
is not a librarian to here?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.476
Yay!

12:24.478 --> 12:26.444
So this is just
how you found it?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.446
Baird slammed the bloke
into it and then poof.

12:28.448 --> 12:32.517
Poof? Someone went poof.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.486
No, that's not--
that's a figure of speech.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.354
He's Australian.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.323
We don't even know what
he's saying half the time.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.024
Do you have any idea
what this is doing

12:40.026 --> 12:41.226
out here in the middle
of the woods?

12:41.228 --> 12:43.762
No. I've never
seen this one.

12:43.764 --> 12:44.996
So far it seems pretty--

12:44.998 --> 12:49.100
ah!

12:49.102 --> 12:50.502
What the hell?

12:50.504 --> 12:52.437
- Optical illusion.
- Optical illusion?

12:52.439 --> 12:56.341
No, that was col. Baird.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.910
You're right, it was
an optical illusion.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.479
That's what we call
them in Australia.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.048
Col. Baird, you know,
oi, sun in my eyes.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.083
Thought I saw--
thought I saw a col. Baird.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.985
( Chuckles )

13:06.987 --> 13:09.888
Well, wow, you really don't
expect me to buy that, do you?

13:09.890 --> 13:11.089
I don't know, maybe.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.091
Well, it's actually
worked before.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.392
Yeah, it does.
It's weird.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.361
Okay.
You're not librarians.

13:16.363 --> 13:20.532
Well, no, actually,
we are, mostly.

13:20.534 --> 13:25.937
But I really need you
to trust me, okay?

13:25.939 --> 13:29.407
I need you not say anything to
anyone else in town about this.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.408
Look, if something's
going on in my town,

13:30.410 --> 13:31.810
I need to know about it.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.378
And I promise you--
I promise,

13:33.380 --> 13:37.282
I'll tell you everything I know.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.983
I really need you to go
back to the archives

13:38.985 --> 13:42.153
right now and dig up
anything on these gas lamps.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.124
Do not hold out on me.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.530
I accept all your apologies.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.374
So what?
Baird's a ghost?

14:03.376 --> 14:07.078
Hmm, no, ghosts are
ectoplasmic entities.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.514
Col. Baird was caught
in some kind

14:09.516 --> 14:11.482
of energy discharge,
but what kind?

14:11.484 --> 14:13.484
We need more data
to narrow it down.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.053
Precisely.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.355
Fortunately, Mr. Finch
provided us

14:17.357 --> 14:19.490
with the right tool for the job.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.960
Mostly, he was in the ballpark.

14:21.962 --> 14:25.196
I've made a few adjustments
and behold.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.233
Now these lenses
should allow you to perceive

14:28.235 --> 14:30.201
a range of energy frequencies,

14:30.203 --> 14:33.872
hopefully, in better focus
than their predecessors.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.506
Once we track the energies
down to their source,

14:35.508 --> 14:37.609
we should be able
to piece together

14:37.611 --> 14:39.611
what happened and
hopefully reverse it.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.346
Ezekiel will take these.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.615
Weird magic energy is
more of Cassandra's thing.

14:43.617 --> 14:45.316
Okay. I see enough
psychedelic visions of my own,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.018
so, no, thank you.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.654
Yes, and you're the one
that lost her.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.456
I'm gonna go down the archive.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.391
I wanna see if I can dig up
anything I can on these gas lamps,

14:53.393 --> 14:55.627
see if I can tell
where they came from.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.295
I don't know.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.307
Is there a problem, sweetheart?

15:09.309 --> 15:12.176
This is not what it looks like.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.113
Looks like you broke
into my archives.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.081
Hope you didn't break the lock,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.549
because I'm also
the maintenance department.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.918
Yeah.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.286
You don't trust me?

15:21.288 --> 15:23.321
Listen, whatever is going
on with these gas lamps,

15:23.323 --> 15:26.224
it could be dangerous.

15:26.226 --> 15:30.228
Well, if I can't stop you,
we can work together.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.530
Early town records are this way.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.166
- Yeah.
- It goes--right.

15:36.568 --> 15:39.304
Energy flow is...

15:41.607 --> 15:43.074
That way.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.376
How strong?

15:45.378 --> 15:48.313
Stronger-ish.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.448
Okay.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.650
Energy differential is positive,

15:52.652 --> 15:57.689
it's growing, tulips,
and roses, pansies.

15:57.691 --> 16:00.525
But it's not random.

16:00.527 --> 16:04.028
There's a design to it,

16:04.030 --> 16:06.397
it's all channels and flows.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.568
It's a circuit.

16:10.570 --> 16:15.540
The energy is flowing through
gas lamps across the town.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.442
Where is it coming from and why?

16:17.444 --> 16:19.344
Your guess is as good as mine.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.379
I'm pretty sure my guess is
actually way better than yours.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.982
Look, I think I can triangulate
it back to the source.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.750
I'm pretty sure you
need me to...

16:25.752 --> 16:27.518
Ah!

16:27.520 --> 16:29.253
Wait, what?

16:29.255 --> 16:31.122
So we're just like screaming
whenever the mood takes us?

16:31.124 --> 16:32.757
Baird, she's here.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.226
Here? Where?

16:35.228 --> 16:36.761
I mean, is she okay?

16:36.763 --> 16:40.498
She's annoyed with me,
so, yeah, she's fine.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.702
She wants us to go that way.

16:44.704 --> 16:49.507
Col. Baird, the source of
the circuit is that way.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.011
So I think that's where we can
find out what's causing this?

16:53.013 --> 16:56.180
I think she wants you
to go on ahead

16:56.182 --> 16:58.516
and for me to follow her
this way.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.351
Good plan.
I can take care of myself.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.753
Are you implying I can't?

17:01.755 --> 17:04.021
No, baird is.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.762
Yeah, yeah, right behind you.
This isn't weird at all.

17:10.763 --> 17:14.031
In the original proposed layout town
hall was on this side of main street,

17:14.034 --> 17:15.333
- uh-hmm.
- They moved it.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.035
Why?

17:17.037 --> 17:19.303
I don't know, maybe
they changed their minds?

17:19.305 --> 17:21.239
I don't know.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.675
Okay, so there's a gas lamp
where they were gonna build it.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.310
They moved it to put
a gas lamp there?

17:26.311 --> 17:27.678
That doesn't--
it doesn't make sense to me.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.680
Unless, the gas lamps were there

17:29.682 --> 17:32.417
and they built
the town around it.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.253
Yeah, someone built
a bunch of gas lamps

17:35.255 --> 17:38.790
in the middle of nowhere
before the town was here.

17:38.792 --> 17:42.593
I think you're reading just a
little bit too much into this.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.529
Files.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.130
What kind of files clink?

17:46.132 --> 17:47.698
No, no, there's--

17:54.740 --> 17:58.409
you wanna tell me what you're
really doing with those gas lamps?

18:11.156 --> 18:13.458
Wardenclyffe falls.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.226
I thought this
was Collins falls.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.695
Town?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.831
We've already been to town.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.370
That's not good.

18:26.372 --> 18:29.107
If I show you,
you have to promise to help.

18:29.109 --> 18:32.276
I promise you that I will
do the right thing.

18:42.187 --> 18:45.523
Gas lamps were already here

18:45.525 --> 18:49.393
because there was
another town here

18:49.395 --> 18:50.761
built by...

18:54.700 --> 18:57.268
Nikola Tesla.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.414
They're possessing people.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.316
They're body snatching.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.218
( Roars )

19:23.462 --> 19:25.396
The lamp posts.
It screwed with Victor.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.365
Let's see what it
does to you guys.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.369
( Electrical crackling )

19:40.679 --> 19:42.213
Wait.

19:49.388 --> 19:53.324
Oh, Mr. Finch,

19:53.326 --> 19:56.260
you scared me.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.662
What are you doing out here?

19:57.664 --> 20:01.332
Is there a problem, sweetheart?

20:01.334 --> 20:02.733
You're not Finch, are you?

20:05.804 --> 20:07.572
( Grunts )

20:07.574 --> 20:09.574
Oh. Sorry.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.779
What...

20:14.781 --> 20:15.813
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

20:15.815 --> 20:16.981
Up for a barricade?

20:16.983 --> 20:18.583
A pack of body snatchers
coming in hot?

20:18.585 --> 20:20.484
No, listen, I know
what's going on, okay?

20:20.486 --> 20:23.354
There's another town before this
one that was on the same site.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.323
It was called
wardenclyffe falls.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.592
Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll just
barricade by myself then.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.261
It was built 100 ago, part of an
experimental site created by--

20:30.263 --> 20:32.496
- and you're not gonna believe this--
- Nikola Tesla,

20:32.498 --> 20:33.898
genius inventor,
rival of Edison,

20:33.900 --> 20:35.666
and pretty much the reason
why we have electricity

20:35.668 --> 20:38.469
in our homes, also,
get the hell away from her.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.004
She's trying to help us.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.405
Are you?

20:41.407 --> 20:43.608
No, she's
not body-snatched.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.243
Body what?

20:45.245 --> 20:46.544
But they definitely are.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.878
Norman, don't.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.947
Norman? I thought
your name was Victor.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.449
Well, why don't
we start with her

20:51.451 --> 20:54.385
because this photo
is dated 1915.

20:55.821 --> 21:00.258
I told you I had
family commitments.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.926
This is it.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.766
In 1915, Tesla was
doing experiments

21:08.768 --> 21:10.468
in wireless power transmission.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.969
That was Tesla's dream.

21:11.971 --> 21:15.906
Like Wi-Fi only for electricity.
Not just the Internet.

21:15.908 --> 21:19.910
The gas lamps, they're
wireless power transmitters.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.580
Prototypes.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.048
But something went wrong.

21:24.050 --> 21:28.352
We activated the system
and everyone got,

21:28.354 --> 21:30.721
zapped, out of sync.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.323
Out of sync with what?

21:32.325 --> 21:33.891
The universe.

21:33.893 --> 21:38.496
We were stuck in some
inter-dimensional border.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.065
We could see the world,
we were aware of it,

21:41.067 --> 21:42.967
but we couldn't
interact with it.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.036
That's what happened to baird.

21:47.506 --> 21:48.906
How many of you are there?

21:48.908 --> 21:50.908
87 souls.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.610
That sort of flux
is inherently unstable,

21:52.612 --> 21:54.312
how has it lasted this long?

21:54.314 --> 21:55.880
Once he realized
what had happened,

21:55.882 --> 21:58.449
Tesla modified his
transmitters, the gas lamps.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.052
To create an energy field
that would keep us stable.

22:01.054 --> 22:04.422
Without them we cease to exist.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.790
What about you?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.625
I mean, you're still
in your original body.

22:07.627 --> 22:12.863
I was in the main control room
when it happened, insulated.

22:12.865 --> 22:16.434
Most of the people were
knocked entirely out of phase,

22:16.436 --> 22:18.836
but I was winking in and out.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.872
Tesla was able
to anchor me in my body

22:21.874 --> 22:26.911
by turning me into sort of
a grounding wire, I guess.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.983
I've got a question.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.052
- Yeah?
- What' s with the body snatching?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.821
It's necessary.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.456
It's possible for us
to interact with the world

22:38.458 --> 22:40.057
through others.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.827
Interface with their nervous
system just enough to--

22:42.829 --> 22:44.695
yeah, I'm not so concerned
with how you do it,

22:44.697 --> 22:47.498
as to whether or not the bodies
you're riding are okay with it.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
We only use them for
a couple of hours at a time.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.969
Our energy field just
interferes with their memories.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.404
They just lose a couple of hours

22:53.406 --> 22:54.805
here and there like
everyone does.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.741
And what about that skin
you're riding right now?

22:56.743 --> 22:58.442
You've been in there
three weeks,

22:58.444 --> 22:59.643
how much time is he losing?

22:59.645 --> 23:01.979
- All right, easy.
- Easy?

23:01.981 --> 23:03.781
I made a good living
walking the line

23:03.783 --> 23:06.584
between snatching
and borrowing but this?

23:06.586 --> 23:07.818
These people have gone too far.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.953
It was necessary.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.788
Norman, we need their help.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.790
Do you want to tell us
what's going on?

23:12.792 --> 23:18.462
We needed a body that we can hold on
too for a little longer, a stranger.

23:18.464 --> 23:21.499
Someone in town that no one
would notice was missing.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.667
It's the only way that
we could fix things

23:23.669 --> 23:26.103
and we are so, so close
to fixing things.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.506
And you have a plan, young lady?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.674
Let me show you.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.411
Please.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.719
Tesla cut a deal
with the government,

23:41.721 --> 23:43.154
they could
have some of his patents

23:43.156 --> 23:44.955
if they never touched
the old facility.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.191
They erased the records,
built over the town,

23:47.193 --> 23:49.126
but they had to leave this dam.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.795
Tesla spent the rest
of his life trying

23:50.797 --> 23:52.430
to figure out how
to bring us back,

23:52.432 --> 23:54.532
but he was never able
to in his lifetime.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.800
No, how could he?

23:55.802 --> 23:57.468
I mean, dimensional
reintegration

23:57.470 --> 23:58.903
takes an enormous
amount of energy,

23:58.905 --> 24:01.105
particularly for people
who have been in flux

24:01.107 --> 24:02.173
as long as you have.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.641
This is a capacitor.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.609
Tesla built a capacitor
to store the energy.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.878
The turbines are at the dam.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.014
I've been charging it
for the past hundred years.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.449
Wow.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.750
This way.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.555
See there?

24:17.557 --> 24:19.623
The outer casings
on the turbines are shot,

24:19.625 --> 24:21.525
but the mechanisms still work.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.093
A hundred years worth of charge?

24:23.095 --> 24:24.662
That might just do it.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.230
But we need
everything to be ready fast.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.666
The capacitor is old.
It's failing.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.035
So all of the work you've been
doing is to keep this running?

24:31.037 --> 24:32.670
Yes, Norman's
been doing his best,

24:32.672 --> 24:34.071
that's why he needed
a longer term body,

24:34.073 --> 24:36.674
but even with that,
we need to activate it

24:36.676 --> 24:39.076
in the next day or two or
it'll break down completely.

24:39.078 --> 24:43.714
The energy gets discharged
and we'll be stuck.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.583
We've been
running tests every...

24:45.585 --> 24:47.518
Which have caused atmospheric
disturbances, the lights?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.053
Yeah.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.856
All the UFO sightings,
it's from your apparatus?

24:51.858 --> 24:55.226
I told you,
no such thing as ufos.

24:55.228 --> 24:56.827
This may work.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.762
But there's only
so much we can do.

24:58.764 --> 25:03.501
I mean, we're engineers,
but we're not Tesla.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.969
Now that you know,
will you help us?

25:06.671 --> 25:10.274
Will you bring an entire
lost town back into the world?

25:10.276 --> 25:13.978
Please.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.248
You said you'd
do the right thing.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.083
Please.

25:20.752 --> 25:23.220
I say no.

25:23.222 --> 25:26.190
They're taking over bodies instead of
asking for help. You just don't do that.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.725
They're asking for help now.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.527
Yeah, only
because they got caught.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.663
They're people
and they're trapped.

25:32.665 --> 25:37.768
Can you imagine being
stuck for a hundred years,

25:37.770 --> 25:39.169
watching the world go by?

25:39.171 --> 25:42.039
Wanting to do things,
wanting to go places.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.042
Look, all of this is
assuming that we can help.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.279
Based on Tesla's plans, I give it
a fifty-fifty shot at working.

25:48.281 --> 25:50.948
And if it doesn't work,
then what?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.216
If it doesn't work,
the excess energy

25:52.218 --> 25:55.686
gets dispersed through
the gas lamps circuit.

25:55.688 --> 26:01.659
They'll destroy the lamps which is
the only thing keeping them stable.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.128
So if the lamps go, they go.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.263
Yeah. That's if they're
telling the truth.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.831
This isn't a choice.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.568
Right, wrong, true, false,
none of that matters.

26:10.570 --> 26:14.705
Like it or not, it's the only
way to rescue col. Baird.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.740
I already promised to do
the right thing, so.

26:16.742 --> 26:17.975
Well, they'll need
someone at the controls

26:17.977 --> 26:21.579
to process the math
and adapt on the fly.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.650
At least col. Baird
will owe me one.

26:28.019 --> 26:29.653
To make Tesla's
plan work, we need

26:29.655 --> 26:31.121
to get creative.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.190
First we need to rebuild
the relay point up on the roof.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.059
Tesla's blueprints called for

26:35.061 --> 26:36.660
copper wiring,
but carbon composites

26:36.662 --> 26:38.128
will handle the voltage better.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.197
The capacitor is falling apart.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.633
So its harmonic resonance
may fluctuate unpredictably,

26:42.635 --> 26:44.101
which means bigger is better.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.737
We need the gas lamps
all cleaned and refurbished.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.305
Spit-shined,
fresh from the factory.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.675
We only get one shot at this,
so let's not take chances.

26:53.645 --> 26:57.615
So what's the deal, I mean,
you're in your own body,

26:57.617 --> 26:59.817
why'd you just stick around
for a hundred years?

27:03.154 --> 27:06.190
The gas lamps stabilize me, too.

27:06.192 --> 27:10.160
If I cross the border
of the circuit

27:10.162 --> 27:12.129
I'd be as lost as anyone.

27:14.666 --> 27:17.034
So that's why you didn't travel?

27:17.036 --> 27:18.135
Yeah.

27:22.841 --> 27:25.809
What's your excuse?

27:25.811 --> 27:27.344
What do you mean?

27:30.148 --> 27:31.749
I saw that look in your eye.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.985
You looked at my postcards.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.856
You like art, architecture,

27:38.858 --> 27:41.725
to see the Taj Mahal,

27:41.727 --> 27:46.063
the sphinx, the sistine chapel.

27:46.065 --> 27:50.768
I can't go, I never could,

27:50.770 --> 27:54.138
you just didn't.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.241
Why?

27:57.243 --> 27:59.410
My great granddad started
an oil riggin' outfit

27:59.412 --> 28:03.681
in the 1800s and it did well.

28:03.683 --> 28:09.453
Pride and Joy
of my father's life

28:09.455 --> 28:12.890
and then there was a day

28:12.892 --> 28:14.892
when the company started
going under and he was,

28:14.894 --> 28:18.996
well, was in no condition
to run the place.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.297
So...

28:20.299 --> 28:21.899
Sick?

28:21.901 --> 28:24.268
Was he sick? Yeah.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.104
Little bit of that,
a lot of the drink.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.783
You...

28:39.785 --> 28:44.021
Stayed to run the family
company, that's a good reason.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.323
It's an excuse.

28:49.227 --> 28:52.763
I mean, every year
I spent not leaving,

28:52.765 --> 28:56.133
easier it was to stay.

28:56.135 --> 29:00.237
And none of my folks,
none of my friends,

29:00.239 --> 29:03.240
they never got
50 miles from home.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.309
That's the way they liked it.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.814
You spend time
with people who...

29:10.816 --> 29:12.883
don't do something...

29:15.787 --> 29:18.055
And you start feeling
like you can't do it.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.357
That's how it goes.

29:20.359 --> 29:24.128
( Chuckles )

29:24.130 --> 29:26.997
And now that you know better?

29:26.999 --> 29:29.233
I know better.

29:50.889 --> 29:53.090
Hmm.

29:56.060 --> 30:00.330
So how was your first kiss
with a...

30:00.332 --> 30:02.800
130-year-old woman?

30:02.802 --> 30:04.034
Huh.

30:08.239 --> 30:10.007
Takes a little getting used to.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.141
Oh.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.420
All set here.
We're good to go.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.123
Now, if everything works
correctly, col. Baird

30:26.125 --> 30:28.358
should be
the first one restored.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.460
She's not been
in flux very long.

30:30.462 --> 30:31.929
So it will not take
as much energy

30:31.931 --> 30:34.398
to reintegrate her
into this reality.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.400
Okay. Last in,
first out, huh?

30:36.402 --> 30:39.036
Oh, yes, without a doubt.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.471
Well, assuming that miss cillian
and I have successfully

30:41.473 --> 30:44.007
implemented the theoretical
scribblings of a mad genius

30:44.009 --> 30:47.845
using abandoned equipment that's
been in water for a hundred years.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.346
Good pep talk.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.884
Norman?

30:53.886 --> 30:54.985
We're ready.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.286
Let's do it.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.099
( Rumbling )

31:15.306 --> 31:17.641
( Gasps )

31:18.877 --> 31:20.244
I can feel it.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.081
Whoa. That's a big surge.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.382
Did you do that?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.551
No, I think it's
just a--

31:27.553 --> 31:29.219
oh, no.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.955
The capacitor was amplifying
the harmonics exponentially.

31:31.957 --> 31:34.558
What does that mean?
Will it still work?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.226
I don't know.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.433
If this doesn't work
the energy won't

31:43.435 --> 31:45.602
just blow out the gas lamps.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.338
It's going to blow
everything around it.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.642
For how far?

31:51.644 --> 31:53.944
For miles.

31:53.946 --> 31:56.046
Hundreds of miles.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.347
We need to shut it down.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.950
If it works,
will it still blow up?

31:59.952 --> 32:01.418
No. But it's near
as I can tell.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.287
We only have a
50/50 shot at it working.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.356
There are 87 people
trapped here.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.392
And there are 10 times
as many people living in town,

32:08.394 --> 32:10.427
more in a greater blast area.

32:10.429 --> 32:14.131
We didn't factor
this into the risk.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.533
I'll take that risk.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.035
I won't.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.270
( Screams )

32:20.272 --> 32:24.408
No shutting down and
no turning back.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.044
I can't go on like this.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.246
We can't go on like this.

32:29.248 --> 32:32.516
We deserve to live.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.618
( Grunts )

32:34.620 --> 32:36.553
No!

32:36.555 --> 32:38.588
No, no.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.295
Think, think,
think, think, think.

32:55.306 --> 32:59.242
Intertwining, interweaving,

33:00.445 --> 33:02.579
music and melodies,

33:05.650 --> 33:07.150
the key change.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.253
( Beeping )

33:11.756 --> 33:14.691
( Static )

33:14.693 --> 33:16.626
Is it supposed to be
making that noise?

33:16.628 --> 33:20.364
What noise?

33:20.366 --> 33:23.633
You guys hearing some kind
of high pitched beat?

33:23.635 --> 33:27.137
Like, eh-ehhhh-eh-eh.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.673
One short, one long, two short.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.208
It's morse code.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.476
It's l for librarians.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.177
Hey, something's wrong.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.081
Come on.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.023
You heard me.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.090
Well, I did.

33:47.092 --> 33:49.026
- What was that?
- Mosquito tone.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.360
It's a high pitched sound that
only young people can hear.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.429
No offense.

33:52.431 --> 33:55.766
I adjusted the frequencies of the
turbines to send you a message.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.534
Why, what's wrong?

33:59.570 --> 34:01.038
We were.

34:02.673 --> 34:07.611
If this doesn't work,
it's going to blow big.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.246
Like, tunguska big.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.416
Yeah, but it might
not blow, it might work.

34:12.418 --> 34:15.786
I'm so, so sorry.

34:17.655 --> 34:20.190
I don't think
we can take this risk.

34:20.192 --> 34:25.228
If we stop it now,
if we pull the plug,

34:25.230 --> 34:29.132
the energy will discharge
safely, guaranteed.

34:29.134 --> 34:32.768
Everyone will be trapped,
including col. Baird.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.371
I think she'd be the first
one to make that call.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.074
I promised I'd do
the right thing.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.282
The relay on the rooftop,
it has an override switch,

34:45.284 --> 34:47.117
we can turn it off from there.

34:47.119 --> 34:50.520
I will endeavor to stabilize the
energy flow with miss cillian.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.688
The rest of you, go.

35:04.535 --> 35:05.669
( Gasps )

35:05.671 --> 35:07.270
Are you all right?

35:07.272 --> 35:09.773
Yeah. All right.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.541
We can't get through that.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.176
Maybe I can.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.612
I'm stabilized,
I'm a grounding wire.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.481
The energy would
discharge through me.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.748
With that much juice?

35:18.750 --> 35:19.850
Even a grounding wire
can burn out.

35:19.852 --> 35:21.618
You have a better idea?

35:21.620 --> 35:25.555
If I hold on to you, is
that going to ground me, too?

35:25.557 --> 35:27.691
No clue.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.194
All right.

35:38.436 --> 35:41.138
All right.

35:41.140 --> 35:44.608
Yeah.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.742
Guys.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.743
- What?
- What?

35:46.745 --> 35:47.744
Company.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.479
Just take care of it.

35:54.785 --> 35:56.186
( Gasps )

35:59.323 --> 36:00.423
Are you okay?

36:00.425 --> 36:01.825
Yeah.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.527
Yeah, are you?

36:09.700 --> 36:10.867
How about we just
talk about this?

36:12.803 --> 36:14.538
Or you can just wait there.

36:17.608 --> 36:18.575
Eep!

36:20.912 --> 36:22.746
I can't--
I don't think I can walk.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.214
All right.

36:26.884 --> 36:30.720
This wire will help me bleed
off even more of the power.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.259
What's the name of that waiter?

36:36.261 --> 36:38.295
What?

36:38.297 --> 36:41.865
One in the little cafe
off of Pont Neuf,

36:41.867 --> 36:43.667
when we were in Paris?

36:53.878 --> 36:56.546
Okay, short legs, good to know.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.258
( Alarm blaring )

37:09.393 --> 37:11.728
You're thinking of Budapest.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.497
No.

37:14.499 --> 37:17.968
Budapest was where
you lost your luggage.

37:17.970 --> 37:19.536
Paris was...

37:19.538 --> 37:20.670
( Grunts )

37:26.277 --> 37:27.744
( Alarm blaring )

37:28.813 --> 37:30.380
( Power crackling )

37:33.317 --> 37:36.319
You mean, Paris was the rain.

37:36.321 --> 37:41.858
( Groans )

37:41.860 --> 37:44.661
Baird, you're back,

37:44.663 --> 37:47.998
it's working, it's working.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.969
Remember the view
from the Eiffel Tower?

37:54.038 --> 37:55.639
It was raining...

37:58.609 --> 38:02.512
But the lights
made everything glow.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.580
Everything glow, yeah.

38:03.582 --> 38:08.418
Stone, it's working! Oi!

38:08.420 --> 38:11.788
Adieu, monsieur.

38:12.923 --> 38:14.524
( Groans )

38:24.535 --> 38:26.836
( Crackling )

38:37.014 --> 38:38.782
Up there.

38:45.022 --> 38:47.424
Au revoir, ma'am.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.633
It was working,
it was going to work.

38:56.635 --> 38:59.069
We don't know that.

38:59.071 --> 39:00.637
Col. Baird
was trapped for a day,

39:00.639 --> 39:02.472
the rest of them had been
in there for a century.

39:02.474 --> 39:06.009
We just-- we just don't
know that it would've

39:06.011 --> 39:08.044
held together
long enough to help them.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.783
It will really take
another hundred years

39:13.785 --> 39:16.519
for the capacitor
to power up and try again?

39:16.521 --> 39:19.456
There's no capacitor.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.391
The discharge fried it.

39:21.393 --> 39:24.394
The only thing that still
works are the gas lamps.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.529
Which means they're
all still trapped.

39:26.531 --> 39:27.897
There isn't enough energy
for them to even

39:27.899 --> 39:30.133
communicate with us.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.736
It wasn't your fault.

39:32.738 --> 39:35.638
Sometimes you just lose.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.542
You did good, all of you,
but sometimes,

39:39.544 --> 39:41.878
you just lose.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.680
This bites.

39:52.790 --> 39:55.692
Colonel, I thought
you might want this.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.028
What is this?

39:59.030 --> 40:01.131
The appointment book.

40:01.133 --> 40:04.868
The library, by its nature,
works on time scales

40:04.870 --> 40:07.637
beyond the normal
human lifespan.

40:07.639 --> 40:12.976
If a librarian, for example,
built a new capacitor in a dam

40:12.978 --> 40:15.111
with a few stabilizing
design features

40:15.113 --> 40:17.180
and let it charge
for a century or so.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.082
They'd want to make a note of it

40:19.084 --> 40:22.719
so future librarians know
there's an appointment to keep.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.120
Chop-chop.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.198
Hey.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.468
We were gonna grab a
drink, wanna join?

40:38.470 --> 40:42.906
Uh, not tonight,
I got somewhere I got to be.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.548
( Whirring )

41:20.911 --> 41:22.745
Okay.

41:32.056 --> 41:35.058
( Music playing )
