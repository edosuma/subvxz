00:03.837 --> 00:05.306
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas...

00:05.406 --> 00:06.640
All of these cases,

00:06.740 --> 00:07.941
all of these people
are related.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.777
Lamont Moore.
Dario Donnelly.

00:09.877 --> 00:12.946
Lynn Zobrist. The sick mind
behind all of these murders

00:13.047 --> 00:14.615
<i>is Dr. Diane Auerbach.</i>

00:14.715 --> 00:16.984
I was so certain
that she was responsible.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.888
Max, you need to see this.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.591
I need you to get
two rooms at the Aurora.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.993
One for me, one for you.
Use fake names.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.461
<i>Players are assigned a target.</i>

00:27.561 --> 00:29.097
Once they eliminate one,
they inherit

00:29.197 --> 00:31.399
<i>that player's target
as their next assignment.</i>

00:31.499 --> 00:33.867
That was the plan, take out
the last man standing yourself?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.869
But you made that
pretty impossible.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.005
<i>I gave my best player
a real challenge.</i>

00:38.106 --> 00:41.375
You're all in the game now.
May the best man win.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.584

01:32.726 --> 01:34.061
You know we have
a fully stocked minifridge

01:34.162 --> 01:35.329
in our hotel room, right?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.630
I am not paying
ten dollars

01:36.730 --> 01:38.299
for bottled water.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.468
Not even after
the apocalypse.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.671
Your mom's a civil servant,
not a high roller.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.174
How long are
we planning on staying?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.008
I thought you caught the guy
who wanted you dead.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.878
One of 'em, but it kind of seems
like there's another one.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.281
And we just got to
be careful, okay?

01:53.381 --> 01:55.583
It won't be forever.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.190
Hi.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.124
Dad.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.461
You got here fast.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.263
Well, there's a deranged killer

02:09.363 --> 02:10.798
hunting your mama.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.034
It seemed urgent.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.771
I'm worried about you.

02:17.871 --> 02:18.939
I've only been in town an hour

02:19.039 --> 02:20.441
and I've already
tracked you down.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.710
Daniel,
it was really kind of you

02:22.810 --> 02:25.213
to come all this way,
but we're gonna be fine.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.181
I promise--
Maxine.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.184
We're still
a family.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.387
I'm not going anywhere.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.055
Not until you're really safe.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.724
I am so sorry.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.793
I can't do this. I can't.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.763
That went well.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.566
Poor Molly.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.967
What have we got?

02:47.067 --> 02:49.169
Adhesive residue on
her wrists and ankles.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.605
Killer had her bound up.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.308
There's no blood,
no trauma, no ligature marks.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.009
I have no guess
on cause.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.846
Witness in that tent saw

02:58.946 --> 03:00.414
a man wheel this
cart under the 15,

03:00.514 --> 03:01.782
then walked off whistling.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.851
Remembers a fancy suit,
not a face.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.420
It's all right.
We know exactly who did this.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.621
He told us himself.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.189
He signed his work?

03:09.290 --> 03:10.424
He's not just signing his work.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.860
He's giving us the finger.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.129
The only print found
at Molly Tate's dump site

03:16.230 --> 03:17.831
was the <i>digitus medius.</i>

03:17.931 --> 03:19.600
He's flipping us the bird.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.502
Lovely.
In silver ink.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.771
Here's our man, Ronald Winter.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.239
Quite the mugshot.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.875
His wanted poster's gonna
look like an Armani ad.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.711
Put it on the local news,
make him famous.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.413
I can't find any other trace
of his life online.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.482
Uh, this was for
a first-time offense.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.716
Cyberstalking.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.718
So now he's crawling out
from behind

03:37.818 --> 03:40.220
his keyboard to put on a show?

03:40.321 --> 03:43.090
Going public like this feels
like Molly's his opening act.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.526
Who's the audience?
Why dump her like that?

03:45.626 --> 03:48.596
This guy was drafted into that
twisted wheel of death game.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.764
But that's over. Why keep going?

03:50.864 --> 03:52.232
He's a bit different
from the others

03:52.333 --> 03:54.368
tangled up in Ted Hester's
Silver Ink Murders.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.470
Ron had
a troubled youth, too,

03:56.570 --> 03:57.805
but look.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.873
Look at that IQ.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.909
160?
If he's that smart,

04:02.009 --> 04:03.677
you got to imagine
he's got an endgame.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.379
Maybe he's already
told us what it is.

04:05.479 --> 04:08.516
The postcards, the scribbles
on the walls in the white room.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.784
What?
We had
the same instinct

04:10.884 --> 04:12.386
when Ted told us about Ron.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.255
So much so that Catherine
called a forensic linguist

04:15.356 --> 04:18.058
at Quantico. They're
working on it, but...

04:18.158 --> 04:20.328
We don't have enough material
for the cryptanalysts.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.195
If we had
a large enough sample,

04:22.296 --> 04:25.666
they could find patterns,
figure out how Ron's

04:25.766 --> 04:28.336
symbols could
group into words,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.170
sentences, but... we need more.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.073
You're gonna need more
evidence of every kind.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.075
Anything that tells us
where Ron is.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.378
Well, Sonya's ready

04:37.478 --> 04:39.347
to walk us through
Molly's autopsy.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.014
Let's start there.

04:41.114 --> 04:45.018
Jack, please,
where are we on the coffee?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.587
I need caffeine.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.022
Like, any form.
Intravenous would be acceptable.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.326
Hey, sis.
How about you look down?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.027
You all right?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.063
You look kind of exhausted. Yeah.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.631
I'm fine. I just...

04:57.731 --> 04:59.767
I was up all night
with this autopsy while

04:59.867 --> 05:02.803
lover boy over there was
out gallivanting around.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.271
Did you
go on a date?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.440
How'd it go?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.076
Well, he was wearing the same
clothes as yesterday, so...

05:09.176 --> 05:11.812
She was talking
about the autopsy. Ah.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.214
You are right.
Um, not as well as I hoped.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.750
But I still can't tell you
what killed Molly. Mm.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.186
All signs point to Molly
being poisoned orally.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.655
<i>See those small tears
in her laryngopharynx?</i>

05:21.755 --> 05:22.923
That makes me think
that she was forced

05:23.023 --> 05:24.892
to swallow something,
something that

05:24.992 --> 05:27.194
did this.
Whoa!

05:27.294 --> 05:29.663
Yeah.
Pretty sure the
liver's not supposed

05:29.763 --> 05:31.832
to look like a slice
of Swiss cheese.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.801
Hepatic vacuolizations.
Ricin poisoning?

05:33.901 --> 05:35.636
That's what I thought,
but no.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.037
I spent hours
testing the contents

05:37.137 --> 05:38.672
of her stomach. Not a drop.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.541
And then I got really confused
when I opened up

05:40.641 --> 05:43.143
her large intestine
and found extensive bleeding.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.413
Okay, now that sounds
like hydrogen cyanide.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.814
It does,
but again, no.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.516
And before you ask,
I also tested

05:48.616 --> 05:50.117
for arsenic
and strychnine.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.486
Even though it couldn't possibly
be either of those, because...

05:53.854 --> 05:55.689
Hey.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.157
You okay?

05:57.257 --> 05:58.559
Yeah.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.260
Um...
Sorry, uh...

06:00.360 --> 06:02.796
Couldn't be either of those,
because those poisons

06:02.896 --> 06:05.132
don't cause
hepatic vacuolization

06:05.232 --> 06:07.134
and bloody GI, so...

06:08.301 --> 06:10.103
...so I am completely...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.239
Come on, sit down,
take a seat, come on.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.341
Yeah.
Let's get some water
and sit down.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.143
Whoa!

06:17.177 --> 06:18.111
Sonya!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.913
My heart... My heart is racing.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.049
Sonya? Sonya, are you okay?
Get away from me!

06:22.149 --> 06:24.184
Get out! Just get out!
No! I-- No...

06:24.284 --> 06:25.318
Seal off the morgue!

06:25.419 --> 06:26.687
Molly's a Trojan horse.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.121
What are you talking about?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.690
That's why
he dumped her.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.292
He's using her body
to poison all of us.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.895
Control, C16.
This is CSI Allie Rajan.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.197
I need medical assistance
at my location immediately!

06:37.297 --> 06:38.832
Tell me how to help you.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.400
I don't know.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.670
I think whatever killed Molly,
it's killing me.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.371
Listen. Listen.
Just stay with me.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.747
Prepping the pentobarbital.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.284
Give her another 25 mils.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.225
Do they know what it is?

07:38.325 --> 07:39.827
No, but they just
started testing.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.428
And they're straight
on symptomology.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.096
Her heart is racing.
She can't stand.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.332
She's got severe abdominal pain.
Have they checked for sepsis?

07:45.432 --> 07:46.567
Jack, they know everything
that we do.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.368
They're doing all
they can, hon.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.603
How'd this happen?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.004
Sonya said
that she was poisoned

07:51.104 --> 07:52.305
by the same poison
that killed Molly Tate.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.907
Was it airborne?

07:54.007 --> 07:55.142
We don't think so.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.777
She was with the
body for hours.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.445
She said it was
a Trojan horse.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.213
Rigged to
release poison.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.414
I just don't know how.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.050
Are-are you all in danger?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.952
No, none of us
ever touched Molly's body.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.888
Maybe this is why the guy snuck
into our morgue, to-to scout it.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.157
Guys, I don't know how long
Sonya has if we don't figure out

08:10.257 --> 08:11.258
what did this.
We will.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.526
All right?
We will.

08:12.626 --> 08:13.794
Whether we have
to track down Ron

08:13.894 --> 08:15.295
and pry it out of him
or identify

08:15.395 --> 08:17.197
the poison on our own,
we will, okay?

08:17.297 --> 08:18.566
Where do you want us?

08:18.666 --> 08:19.933
Joshua, I want you
at Molly Tate's house.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.602
Beau and Penny are
at the White Room.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.270
Allie, I need you
to suit up.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.338
Somebody's got
to look at the body--
I-I can help.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.007
I've got,
I've got Sonya's notes.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.176
I-I don't want to just sit
on the sidelines here.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.510
I was gonna say,
"Work with Jack."

08:30.611 --> 08:32.445
This man came after
one of our family.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.947
We need all the
help we can get.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.116
And he's gonna realize
what a big mistake that was.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.751
I'm gonna grab Catherine,

08:37.851 --> 08:39.787
and we're gonna talk to Ted
Hester. He picked this guy.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.288
Maybe he'll tell us something.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.557
Hey.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.993
You think this is
a good idea?

08:46.093 --> 08:47.394
To sit down with Ted?

08:47.494 --> 08:48.962
I mean, he's the one
who put you in the crosshairs.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.230
Yeah.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.833
Well, now
he's in mine.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.072
I don't know what to tell you.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.741
Ron's pretty smart.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.710
If he doesn't want
to be found, he won't be.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.545
You put him up to this?
Actually, I didn't.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.615
Ronald's playing
his own game now,

09:07.715 --> 09:10.450
and whatever he does next
will be a surprise to us all.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.419
You know, the one thing
I can say for sure is

09:12.519 --> 09:14.622
it's gonna feel good.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.555
What is?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.124
Being vindicated.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.393
I had the perfect way

09:20.493 --> 09:23.330
to find and eliminate
serial killers,

09:23.430 --> 09:25.699
and you stopped me.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.701
Now we all get to see
if that was a good idea.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.071
I get that this is
a game for you.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.708
But wouldn't it be more fun
if everybody knew how to play?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.877
I might be able to point you
in the right direction,

09:36.977 --> 09:37.911
for a price.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.713
What do you want?
Not much.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.482
A little privacy
and a PlayStation 5

09:42.582 --> 09:44.284
so I can play <i>Shadow Cell.</i>

09:44.384 --> 09:46.620
Give up your MVP
for a video game?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.388
That's
my son's favorite.

09:48.488 --> 09:51.959
They shoot zombies
and chat with their friends.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.160
It's just fun.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.729
You found Richard Sloan
through that game.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.968
Is that how you talk
to Ron, too?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.638
Nice try, Dr. Frankenstein.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.975
We're not handing you
a direct line to your monster.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.176
I tell you what.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.444
You give me your user name,

10:11.544 --> 10:14.414
we'll see what we can do
about that private cell.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.384
Sorry.

10:17.484 --> 10:20.087
I don't negotiate
with terrorists.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.421
That's what you are.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.490
Needlessly putting
the innocent at risk

10:23.590 --> 10:25.759
from people like...
You?

10:25.859 --> 10:29.496
Ronald Edward Winter.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.402
Something tells me I'm gonna be
seeing you again soon, ladies.

10:43.711 --> 10:48.015
Ready? Let's find out
what your sister ran into.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.331
Okay, it's 11:45 p.m.,

11:04.431 --> 11:06.834
December 15, 2022.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.168
This is Sonya Nikolayevich,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.703
head ME Clark County.

11:09.803 --> 11:13.206
I'm performing an autopsy
on a 32-year-old female vic,

11:13.306 --> 11:15.408
and tonight, I'm going in solo.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.110
Hope the date's fun, Jack.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.378
Okay, first impressions.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.612
No blunt-force trauma,

11:19.713 --> 11:23.083
no GSW, no knife wounds.
Possibly poison.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.318
But I do need to get inside
to be sure.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.987
I'm using a number ten

11:27.087 --> 11:29.656
to perform a standard
Y incision.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.302
Never seen liver vacuolization
like this before.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.906
But the presence of blood

11:46.006 --> 11:47.908
in the vic's GI tract
has me stumped.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.313
And while I'm asking questions
that don't have answers,

11:53.413 --> 11:55.582
why is there an injection site

11:55.682 --> 11:58.251
on the upper right quadrant
of the abdomen?

11:59.820 --> 12:02.189
So Sonya opened
the injection site.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.656
Standard procedure.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.658
If you see something on
the surface you can't explain,

12:05.759 --> 12:08.095
you gotta go deeper
to find the answers.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.462
Wait, what is that?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.730
It's like a pocket

12:10.831 --> 12:12.265
in between the layers
of Molly's skin.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.903
Condition and the color says
it was created postmortem.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.505
That would mean
that Ron made it.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.541
Why would he do
that, and how?

12:21.641 --> 12:23.443
I think I can answer
both questions.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.945
<i>After he killed her,</i>

12:25.045 --> 12:26.613
<i>Ron gave her
an intradermal injection.</i>

12:26.713 --> 12:29.349
<i>The liquid forced the layers
of Molly's skin apart,</i>

12:29.449 --> 12:30.918
<i>creating this pocket.</i>

12:31.018 --> 12:32.585
<i>And that pocket held
his mystery poison</i>

12:32.685 --> 12:34.321
<i>until Sonya sliced it open.</i>

12:39.459 --> 12:40.360
Mm.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.629
Got a little spatter here.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.633
Did you hear that? I think
that's when it happened.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.569
That's it, right there.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.404
When she hit this dermal pocket,
that was it.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.672
I think
you're right.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.008
I think that's how
she got dosed.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.878
Okay.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.714
I'm gonna test this

13:01.815 --> 13:04.084
and tell you
what I find.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.456
Huh.
This guy didn't
just kill Molly Tate.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.892
He got her poor fish, too.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.096
We got serious signs
of a struggle.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.832
This is probably
where it went down.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.575
He held her here, too.

13:28.675 --> 13:32.712
<i>Same residue was on Molly's
wrists and ankles.</i>

13:35.448 --> 13:37.250
He sure was careful
to keep the room dark.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.452
Had to make it look like
nobody was home three days ago.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.855
That's a pretty specific timeline.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.690
Right after we arrested
Ted Hester,

13:43.790 --> 13:45.458
I sent a car over here
to check on Molly.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.761
The uniforms knocked,
no answer.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.405
Thanks, Molly.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.008
This might tell us
what he was playing with.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.710
Ma'am, I need you
to stay back.

14:03.810 --> 14:04.844
This is my
daughter's house.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.246
This is
a crime scene.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.182
I want to see her.
I want to see my Molly!

14:09.282 --> 14:11.218
She was poisoned?

14:11.318 --> 14:12.785
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.988
This was always
our worst nightmare.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.524
Molly had so
many allergies.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.093
Peanuts, bananas, cotton.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.594
We spent her
whole childhood

14:21.694 --> 14:23.496
terrified of anaphylaxis.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.898
Did she take medication
for that?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.067
I'll give you a list.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.769
She was on more
than allergy meds.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.805
Molly had some
trouble emotionally.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.574
Ever since she was
a little kid.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.409
That may actually be why
she was targeted.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.345
What?

14:38.445 --> 14:42.049
We recently arrested
a really disturbed individual.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.450
He had a list of folks
who suffered

14:43.550 --> 14:46.019
mental health afflictions
like your daughter.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.754
He was trying
to get rid of them.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.890
Molly wasn't a bad person.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.660
Her troubles, they
were just baked in.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.228
We got her doctors.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.763
We got her fish.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.566
Whenever Molly felt like she
was slipping under the waves,

14:59.666 --> 15:02.869
I bought her another friend
to keep her company.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.572
Help her swim back up.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.540
It never solved
anything, but...

15:07.640 --> 15:09.176
She knew you cared.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.212
A few months ago,
everything changed.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.348
Out of nowhere, Molly
started refusing my help.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.050
What?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.352
The guy we told you about,

15:19.452 --> 15:22.055
he made contact with her
a few months back.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.391
He may have been
blackmailing her.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.627
If you know something...
She never told me anything.

15:27.727 --> 15:28.828
She kept me out.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.531
I always tried, but...

15:31.631 --> 15:33.133
You did what you could.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.136
Well, clearly, it wasn't enough.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.407
Just tell me that you're going
to find the person who did this.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.491
The poison that
killed Molly Tate.

15:58.591 --> 16:02.395
I've run it through the Agilent,
the GC/MS, the Xevo,

16:02.495 --> 16:04.531
the IXRF and the FTIR.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.667
Nothing. I can't identify it.
It's either novel or...

16:07.767 --> 16:09.169
Extremely rare.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.371
I did a bit better.
Epithelials from the pocket

16:11.471 --> 16:13.506
confirm it belonged
to Ron Winter.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.442
And the GC/MS determined that

16:15.542 --> 16:17.644
the holes were caused
by nitric acid.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.812
I wonder if he splashed himself
whilst he was making the poison.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.848
If we could find him, maybe
he'd just tell us what it is.

16:21.948 --> 16:22.915
Either that or

16:23.016 --> 16:23.950
we'll have to hope he wrote

16:24.051 --> 16:26.019
his recipe down someplace.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.089
Found more hieroglyphs.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.427
This guy had a lot to say.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.329
I can't tell you
what any of it means.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.331
I've been staring
at squiggles so long

16:38.431 --> 16:40.033
I'm starting to see
'em in my sleep.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.968
Memory card's almost full.
How many squiggle pics

16:42.069 --> 16:44.771
do think it'll take to crack
the Ron Winter crazy code?

16:44.871 --> 16:46.339
Code breaking's hard.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.541
I doubt anyone can say how many
character combos we need

16:48.641 --> 16:49.876
to start
finding patterns.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.711
The linguist at Quantico
just said "more."

16:51.811 --> 16:53.446
Well, I've been keeping track
of distinct characters,

16:53.546 --> 16:54.881
and I think we're at 34.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.649
That's eight more than
my favorite alphabet.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.251
Maybe it all translates
to Cyrillic.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.719
We ought to be looking for

16:59.819 --> 17:01.321
repetitions
of the same character.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.256
That's how Alan Turing cracked
the Nazi's Enigma code.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.725
Those two look like
the Bat-Signal.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.760
Zodiac's code took
50 years to crack.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.396
Just leave that
to the supercomputers.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.199
We're just better off
focusing on the evidence.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.000
Nobody collects
baseball cards anymore?

17:14.101 --> 17:16.169
Why did he have so many
infrared smoke detectors?

17:16.269 --> 17:18.438
Maybe Ron's
a safety nut.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.507
Well, none of 'em went off
when the fire started.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.709
Some of 'em don't even
have batteries.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.245
These are just completely disabled.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.357
Hey.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.504
Hello?

17:51.604 --> 17:52.872
Mr. Winter,

17:52.972 --> 17:55.142
this is you, isn't it?

17:56.042 --> 17:57.844
Good afternoon, Maxine.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.646
Let's give everyone a moment

17:59.746 --> 18:01.214
to join before we begin.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.550
Hello?
This is Detective Chavez.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.817
Who is this?

18:04.917 --> 18:05.852
Sounds like
we have a quorum.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.687
It's nice to meet everyone.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.089
I am Ronald Winter.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.958
Of course, you know that.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.726
Just the man
we're looking for.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.828
I'm the man you're hunting.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.264
But that's a two-way street,
isn't it?

18:17.364 --> 18:18.965
What have we done
to you, Ron?

18:19.065 --> 18:21.168
Why would you poison
our medical examiner?

18:21.268 --> 18:22.635
Is this Miss Rajan?

18:22.735 --> 18:24.604
I read about you.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.840
I'm sorry, I won't be divulging
that information at this point.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.543
Why not? I mean, the man
that was blackmailing you

18:30.643 --> 18:31.578
is in jail.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.912
His game is over.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.381
Yes, I read about Mr. Hester.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.550
It was very kind of you
to take care of him.

18:38.185 --> 18:41.053
But, uh, you found him
a little too late,

18:41.154 --> 18:42.322
or too early.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.457
I'm not really quite sure
which it is.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.958
If you're not acting
on his orders,

18:46.058 --> 18:47.360
Ron, what are you doing?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.128
It's something much,
much bigger.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.963
It was a shame about
Dr. Nikolayevich,

18:51.063 --> 18:52.799
but I thought it was
only fair to show you.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.968
I can get to anyone. Anyone.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.437
Anywhere.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.875
I had to assume Mr. Hester
would have promulgated my name.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.611
That is what he does,
after all.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.813
So I had to make it clear
what would happen

19:06.913 --> 19:08.381
if he would not give me
the space

19:08.481 --> 19:09.482
to finish what I started.
The only way this ends

19:09.582 --> 19:10.483
is with you behind bars.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.618
No!

19:13.720 --> 19:14.854
Now is when you listen,

19:14.954 --> 19:17.056
so you don't get hurt.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.958
I just called you to tell you

19:19.058 --> 19:21.060
to sit back and relax.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.196
Let me lighten your workload.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.797
What does that mean, Ron?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.165
Ron.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.468
What does that mean?

19:38.110 --> 19:39.779
How did Ron get
all our phone numbers?

19:39.879 --> 19:41.381
Well, he walked
into our lab and left a note.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.882
Clearly,
he took something with him.

19:42.982 --> 19:43.816
Now is when you listen,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.218
so you don't get hurt.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.986
I just called you to tell you

19:47.086 --> 19:48.688
to sit back and relax.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.022
Let me lighten your workload.
Did you hear that?

19:50.122 --> 19:51.424
Mm.
Not Ron.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.759
What's happening behind him.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.826
That sounds like
kids playing.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.562
Maybe he's calling
from a park?

19:55.662 --> 19:57.530
Hardly narrows it down. Yeah.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.966
I just wish LVPD could have
traced his call.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.835
Mr. Winter is way too savvy
to be caught like that.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.637
We're gonna have to
find a different way

20:04.737 --> 20:05.805
to catch this guy.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.674
What about his
mystery poison?

20:07.774 --> 20:10.009
Do Sonya's doctors have
any idea what it was yet?

20:10.109 --> 20:13.145
No. We're all still banging
our heads against the wall.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.648
So it's up to us
to identify the poison

20:15.748 --> 20:17.116
and save Sonya's life.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.486
Yeah, one this exotic
might tip Ron's hand

20:19.586 --> 20:21.288
and help us find him.
Max?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.389
Yeah?

20:22.489 --> 20:23.656
There is someone in your office

20:23.756 --> 20:25.191
you're gonna want to talk to.
Who?

20:25.292 --> 20:27.126
Ronald Winter.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.496
Senior.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.697
<i>I wish I was more surprised.</i>

20:30.797 --> 20:32.565
Ronnie's always been a...

20:32.665 --> 20:34.634
a handful.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.002
We're not close.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.737
He got his brains
from his mother,

20:37.837 --> 20:39.706
and never had much use for me.
Neither of 'em did.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.773
Is he with her now?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.074
Helen died of cancer.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.576
She left me with
a six-year-old

20:43.676 --> 20:44.811
who was already
smarter than I was.

20:44.911 --> 20:45.812
It was no picnic,

20:45.912 --> 20:47.280
but I did all I could.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.081
Probably not, though, right?

20:49.181 --> 20:51.351
I mean, you say
your son is gifted?

20:51.451 --> 20:52.485
He's a killer.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.020
He poisoned an innocent woman,

20:54.120 --> 20:55.555
and used her body

20:55.655 --> 20:57.524
to poison one of
our colleagues, too.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.191
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.893
We do not need your sympathy.
We need your son's location.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.229
I don't know where Ronnie is.
Well, neither do we.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.964
Look, ladies, it's like
I told the detective.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.533
I-I wish I could help.
Okay. So let me guess.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.168
You came in here to say
that you helped the police,

21:09.268 --> 21:10.537
but you haven't given us
a damn thing.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.439
You got his number?

21:12.539 --> 21:13.773
Call him.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.808
He won't answer.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.245
Your call has been forwarded...

21:19.346 --> 21:20.547
See?
...to an automatic
voice message...

21:20.647 --> 21:21.648
We only ever
talk over text.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.183
Most times, I need a dictionary

21:24.283 --> 21:25.518
just to get the gist.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.888
"Orgulous.
Umbrage. Ennui."

21:28.988 --> 21:30.390
God, what a gasbag.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.760
Ronnie's big ol' vocabulary
may be just what we need

21:33.860 --> 21:35.027
to track him down

21:35.127 --> 21:37.029
if he uses these
obscure words online.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.066
Right? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, we keepin' this.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.069
Allie.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.037
What are you doing here, Jack?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.238
I just came from
the hospital.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.607
Sonya's heartrate's
over 100.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.008
Her blood
pressure's 90/60.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.176
All her vitals are heading
the wrong direction.

21:50.276 --> 21:52.311
I don't know how
long she's got.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.747
I came here because whatever
she got splashed with,

21:54.847 --> 21:56.315
it's giving her a
positive GUAIAC test.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.051
That's usually an indicator
of arsenic or amatoxin.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.787
I know. We eliminated
both of those.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.823
Along with strychnine,
cyanide, ricin.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.157
I just, like, I can't think
of another poison

22:05.257 --> 22:06.359
that would
trigger a positive.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.160
I can.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.662
Abrin.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.932
Damn it, it's negative! How?

22:13.032 --> 22:13.800
Maybe...

22:13.900 --> 22:15.835
Maybe the test is wrong.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.269
High-affinity
monoclonal antibodies

22:17.370 --> 22:19.739
have made these tests
incredibly accurate.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.541
It's not abrin.

22:21.641 --> 22:22.675
I just don't understand why...

22:30.417 --> 22:33.119
It should have been me.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.956
Sonya would have figured out
what the poison was by now...

22:38.825 --> 22:40.159
and saved me.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.629
Jack, we're gonna save
your sister.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.431
I promise you.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.400
You're not supposed to make
promises to the family.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.436
I know.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.370
But I'm making one anyway.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.311
Go
ahead, take 'em.

22:59.412 --> 23:02.014
A buddy of mine has a rental
property out in Henderson.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.250
You and Bryan will be
safe there.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.285
You can stay as long
as you need.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.654
No strings attached.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.689
Daniel, you don't need
to do this, okay?

23:09.789 --> 23:11.658
Actually,
Maxine, I do.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.626
I have to do something.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.129
I've had four years
to think about

23:17.229 --> 23:18.898
where it went wrong with us.

23:18.998 --> 23:24.203
And my biggest regret is
not being more decisive.

23:24.303 --> 23:25.204
Not showing you.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.273
Daniel, if...

23:27.373 --> 23:30.510
Hey, I flew across
the country.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.745
Will you let me
finish a sentence?
I'll let you finish.

23:32.845 --> 23:33.913
Do you remember what
I said to you

23:34.013 --> 23:36.282
the day Bryan was born?
Yes.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.450
What?

23:37.550 --> 23:39.118
That we were gonna
make mistakes

23:39.218 --> 23:40.753
as parents. Yeah.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.523
But that we're gonna
make them together.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.857
And we did.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.159
For a while we were
on the same page.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.395
But then
things changed

23:49.496 --> 23:52.164
If I'm being honest...

23:52.264 --> 23:54.801
I changed.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.970
I'm sorry.

23:58.905 --> 24:02.308
You do not owe me anything.
Okay?

24:02.408 --> 24:05.177
I just want to protect
the people I care about.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.916
You never left
the top of the list.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.453
I just stopped saying it.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.457
Here.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.878
Whoa, this is not
the same code.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.014
This is math. Ron was
calculating something.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.784
Math is a language
we do know.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.719
This could be like
our Rosetta Stone.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.087
I mean, do you think
it even adds up?

24:48.187 --> 24:49.889
What do you mean?
I mean,

24:49.989 --> 24:51.758
None of the rest of this
even makes sense, Penny.

24:51.858 --> 24:55.728
You ever heard of the phrase
"ravings of a madman"?

24:55.828 --> 24:57.730
What, you think this
is all gibberish?

24:57.830 --> 24:59.532
That would be so disappointing.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.404
What have you got?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.540
Just a burnt mess,
but it's a burnt mess

25:07.640 --> 25:09.508
that smells like accelerant.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.279
Is that turpentine
and butane?

25:13.379 --> 25:14.947
Yeah. Diesel, too.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.549
I think Ron made
a chemical cocktail

25:16.649 --> 25:18.718
to ensure that the fire burned
real hot right here.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.053
<i>I don't think he was interested
in torching the whole room</i>

25:21.153 --> 25:23.489
<i>as much as he was
destroying this.</i>

25:24.724 --> 25:26.292
What do you think <i>this</i> was?

25:26.392 --> 25:28.661
More smoke detectors,
and... I don't know yet.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.297
You're the one who's always
bragging about her Lego skills.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.179
You see this dark blob?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.649
I'm pretty sure it used to be
a size-six rubber stopper.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.984
Well, whatever it is, I think
it was on the end of this

25:52.084 --> 25:53.452
melted tan noodle,

25:53.552 --> 25:55.187
which I think looked like
a latex hose.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.889
Got your noodle's
other end melted to

25:56.989 --> 25:58.424
a bunch of
shattered glass.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.226
Might be a tank
of some kind.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.361
Well, that corroded husk
is definitely a car battery.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.197
And we've got these electrodes.
Got a tank, a power supply...

26:05.297 --> 26:07.199
latex hose.
I mean, the setup is perfect

26:07.299 --> 26:08.467
for electrolytic precipitation.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.002
Ron had himself
a little chem lab.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.403
That's why
he rigged it to burn,

26:11.503 --> 26:13.606
so we'd never figure out
what he had cooked up.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.041
We'll see about that.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.676
GC/MS doesn't care
how big of a mess he made.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.611
Okay.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.847
Tropane.
Tropane?

26:20.947 --> 26:22.081
Tropane.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.716
Okay, uh, I'll get Max.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.017
You call the hospital.
This doesn't makes sense.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.185
Tropane isn't a poison.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.854
Not unless you ingest
gallons of it.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.823
It's a precursor that can be
turned into atropine or cocaine.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.925
But neither of those chemicals
was on Sonya's tox screen.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.627
Yeah, I know.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.262
It's another dead end.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.733
If there's any change--
Okay, thank you.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.969
They had to put Sonya
in a medically-induced coma.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.170
The pain was too much.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.571
We may have
a new angle soon.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.306
Mm-hmm.
DA's making a deal
with Ted Hester.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.041
His lawyer insists
he knows Ron's plan.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.310
They're meeting right now.
Tell him to make space
at that table.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.780
Catherine and I want
a second crack.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.481
Hey, Max.

26:55.581 --> 26:57.383
You look about like I would
if I was about to

26:57.483 --> 26:58.885
give a present to a man
who ordered my death.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.052
You really don't have
to do this with me.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.420
You're as bad as my ex.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.889
So he's worried
about you, too?

27:02.989 --> 27:04.123
Yeah, he doesn't
think I feel safe.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.391
Pupils are dilated. Unreactive.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.960
Get back! Get back!
He's crashing!

27:08.060 --> 27:08.995
That's Ted.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.197
Ron's pretty smart.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.331
What happened?

27:12.431 --> 27:13.499
He's seizing.

27:13.599 --> 27:14.901
I need vitals on him now.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.535
Take his pulse ox.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.909
Winter did say,
"Anyone. Anywhere."

27:23.009 --> 27:25.611
Yeah, but he didn't
tell us who's next.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.921
That looks familiar.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.288
Is that the slide
of Ted's liver?

27:36.388 --> 27:37.757
It looks worse
than Molly's.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.591
His GI tract is
in worse shape, too.

27:39.692 --> 27:40.693
He must've
got an even

27:40.793 --> 27:42.194
more concentrated
dose of...

27:42.294 --> 27:44.163
What? What does this?

27:44.263 --> 27:46.766
I'm not seeing any
puncture marks on Ted's skin

27:46.866 --> 27:47.967
with the forensic scope.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.702
Means he's not
another Trojan horse.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.537
Ron didn't have access
to Ted's body.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.540
He must have somehow
poisoned his food.

27:54.640 --> 27:55.908
You think
he took it orally?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.209
You see that bluish
goo right in there?

27:57.309 --> 27:58.845
That is the aftermath
of a cupcake,

27:58.945 --> 28:00.579
which was definitely
not on the jail's menu.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.681
Chavez can pull surveillance
up from the jail,

28:02.782 --> 28:04.450
but I don't think
we should get our hopes up.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.118
Yeah.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.254
It's not like you need
Andy Dufresne's tunnel

28:08.354 --> 28:09.722
to smuggle contraband

28:09.822 --> 28:11.090
into Clark County jail. Okay.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.159
I'm gonna choose to look
on the bright side here.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.928
Both Ted and Molly
swallowed the poison.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.663
That's why
they died so quickly.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.832
Sonya was exposed
through her skin.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.333
Her symptoms might be
progressing slower,

28:21.433 --> 28:22.534
but they're still progressing.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.570
Her SpO2's dropped
below 90%.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.005
She's got hours,

28:26.105 --> 28:27.573
not days, and the guy
that did this to her,

28:27.673 --> 28:29.441
he-he could be anywhere.

28:34.747 --> 28:37.817
Okay, Mr. Winter.
Here we are.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.585
Looks like there was a
problem with your garment.

28:39.685 --> 28:40.820
What are you talking about?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.188
You have a stain
we couldn't get out,

28:42.288 --> 28:43.823
from your lab coat.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.025
Something abrasive.
Maybe bleach?

28:49.195 --> 28:51.230
Well...

28:51.330 --> 28:52.631
I appreciate you trying.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.767
Say, do you like
cupcakes?

28:54.867 --> 28:57.503
Today was my niece's
birthday party, and uh...

28:57.603 --> 29:00.006
I almost have
a whole box left.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.176
Sure.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.652
All right, Agent Mercer,
that's the last one.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.154
You guys get it?

29:15.254 --> 29:16.688
Page 245. Clear as a bell.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.992
Yeah, but it should be
45,234 characters total.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.961
That's a start.
We'll let you know.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.529
Whoa, whoa.

29:23.629 --> 29:24.931
How about an ETA?

29:25.031 --> 29:26.498
How long does it
usually take your fancy

29:26.598 --> 29:29.368
code-cracking software to,
you know, crack the code?

29:29.468 --> 29:30.636
The characters are handwritten.

29:30.736 --> 29:31.938
Lots of variance.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.305
Could take nine or ten years.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.740
What?
Uh, sorry.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.976
Sounded like you said
nine or ten years?

29:37.076 --> 29:39.278
Could be.
Could be nine or ten days.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.980
Call me next week--
I'll let you know

29:41.080 --> 29:42.481
which way it's looking.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.750
Isn't that guy head of
the FBI Cryptanalyst Unit?

29:44.851 --> 29:46.418
What's he got,
a computer powered by

29:46.518 --> 29:47.987
a hamster wheel?
Beau warned me

29:48.087 --> 29:49.421
it'd be slow going.
Even so,

29:49.521 --> 29:50.823
you think we could run
the Bureau's software

29:50.923 --> 29:52.058
on all our
computers?

29:52.158 --> 29:53.759
Focus up, Penny.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.227
Oh, I'm not playing
<i>Shadow Cell.</i>

29:55.327 --> 29:57.763
I'm searching
its chat function.
For what?

29:57.864 --> 30:00.399
Max thinks that Ted contacted
Ron through the game,

30:00.499 --> 30:02.168
so I've been trying
to find their correspondence.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.003
But without knowing
their screen names,

30:04.103 --> 30:06.338
and with over 80 million
comments in the chat,

30:06.438 --> 30:09.008
it feels like that's a search
that'll take a decade, too.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.143
Mm-hmm.
I just spent an hour

30:11.243 --> 30:13.079
on the phone to
a mathematician from MIT

30:13.179 --> 30:15.047
who finally admitted
he has no idea

30:15.147 --> 30:16.515
what this calculation's
supposed to be.

30:16.615 --> 30:17.616
Beau's been doing
the same thing.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.151
With similar results.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.087
You'd think math would be
an easier language to decode

30:21.187 --> 30:24.223
than schizophrenic
medieval gibberish.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.993
Maybe I'll ask him.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.461
Can you trace it?
Yeah, I can try

30:29.561 --> 30:31.330
with an IMSI catcher.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.033
Okay.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.141
Hello?

30:42.241 --> 30:44.143
Ms. Rajan, hello.
How are you?

30:44.243 --> 30:45.411
Not great, Ron.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.512
A friend of mine
is in ICU.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.014
You put her there.

30:48.114 --> 30:50.516
She would be a lot better
if you told me what you used.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.451
I'm sorry, I really do
want to share with you,

30:52.551 --> 30:53.652
but not that.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.354
Why not?
Many reasons.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.622
How's Ted Hester?

30:56.722 --> 30:57.856
He's very dead.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.425
Is that why you called?

30:59.525 --> 31:00.859
To confirm that he's gone?

31:00.960 --> 31:03.529
You're...
quite brilliant,

31:03.629 --> 31:05.097
actually.
How did you pull it off?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.832
You're quite clever, too,
Miss Rajan.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.367
I wasn't admitted once
to Harvard,

31:08.467 --> 31:09.535
let alone twice.

31:09.635 --> 31:10.937
But I must insist,

31:11.037 --> 31:12.939
we won't be discussing
my methods.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.440
My motives are more
interesting anyway.

31:14.540 --> 31:15.707
Where are you, Ron?

31:15.807 --> 31:17.276
Let's meet up and
talk in person.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.677
Oh, Miss Rajan.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.112
How utterly disappointing.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.747
From what I glean remotely,

31:21.847 --> 31:22.949
you're the most
perspicacious CSI.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.917
Ron, you flatter me.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.818
But I have to ask--
to what end?

31:26.919 --> 31:29.755
Because we are both afflicted.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.490
Plagued.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.126
Did you poison me, too?

31:34.961 --> 31:37.663
No, uh, I haven't
exposed you to anything

31:37.763 --> 31:39.265
that you aren't
immune to already.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.599
And what's that?

31:40.699 --> 31:41.867
People.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.569
Hell is other people.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.437
Their stupidity.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.673
You might be
the only other person

31:47.773 --> 31:49.375
who understands what I'm doing.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.011
I think you'll be grateful once
they've all been eradicated.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.413
Who?
Who are you referring to?

31:54.513 --> 31:57.049
Patience, Miss Rajan.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.586
You will see tonight.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.254
It really will be, uh...

32:03.622 --> 32:04.723
...lights out.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.894
Tell me you traced it.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.197
And then he just hung up?

32:11.297 --> 32:12.798
Penny said he was using
a relay device

32:12.898 --> 32:14.366
to stop us from
pinpointing his location.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.802
Smart as advertised.
Where are we on poison?

32:16.902 --> 32:18.637
All we can tell you
is what it isn't.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.106
It's not tropane.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.907
That's the only chemical
we found in Ron's DIY lab.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.575
Why would he set a fire
to hide a chemical

32:23.675 --> 32:24.776
that's not the poison?

32:24.876 --> 32:26.078
Well, he might've added tropane

32:26.178 --> 32:27.613
to mask whatever he was
actually making.

32:27.713 --> 32:28.680
You see this plating?

32:28.780 --> 32:30.182
Tropane's organic.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.384
Its extraction doesn't leave
metal on electrodes.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.892
So something else must've been
the source of that plating.

32:40.993 --> 32:41.927
Any ideas?

32:42.028 --> 32:44.163
Unfortunately, we have none.

32:44.263 --> 32:45.364
Hold on.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.632
How many of these
infrared smoke detectors

32:46.732 --> 32:47.733
did Ron have?
Dozens.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.235
None of them work;

32:49.335 --> 32:50.536
it was a weird
little collection.
Then that's it.

32:50.636 --> 32:51.770
Wait. You think--

32:51.870 --> 32:53.539
Infrared smoke
detectors contain

32:53.639 --> 32:55.807
tiny amounts of
various heavy metals.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.909
Right. It's what makes them
so sensitive to smoke particles.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.512
<i>He was probably harvesting
heavy metal ore</i>

33:00.612 --> 33:02.014
<i>from the smoke detectors.</i>

33:02.114 --> 33:03.382
<i>He could dissolve it
into a solution</i>

33:03.482 --> 33:04.750
<i>if he had a strong
enough acid...</i>

33:04.850 --> 33:06.252
<i>Like nitric acid,</i>

33:06.352 --> 33:07.819
<i>which explains the holes
in his shirt pocket.</i>

33:07.919 --> 33:09.921
So Ron was using
these electrodes

33:10.022 --> 33:11.657
to send different currents

33:11.757 --> 33:13.959
into his acid solution
to draw out

33:14.060 --> 33:15.427
a metal of
his choice.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.463
A really nasty metal--

33:17.563 --> 33:18.964
thallium.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.133
That's his poison.

33:21.233 --> 33:24.336
If I remember my Intro
into Inorganic Chemistry,

33:24.436 --> 33:25.737
symptomology...

33:25.837 --> 33:27.439
checks out.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.076
Cellular death in the GI walls,
bleeding in the small colon,

33:30.176 --> 33:32.244
vacuolization
of the liver...

33:32.344 --> 33:33.545
It was thallium.

33:33.645 --> 33:34.913
How'd we miss this?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.548
Because heavy metal
poisoning is so rare

33:36.648 --> 33:38.050
there's only one machine
on Earth that could ID it.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.851
And we don't have
an ion coupled plasma

33:39.951 --> 33:41.687
atomic emissions spectroscope.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.189
Only geolabs do.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.623
We're damn straight
gonna get one.

33:44.723 --> 33:45.657
But first...

33:45.757 --> 33:47.359
there's an antidote.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.130
As soon as they administered
the Prussian blue,

33:51.230 --> 33:52.831
Sonya's heart rate
started coming down.

33:52.931 --> 33:55.000
She's not
out of the woods yet, but...

33:55.101 --> 33:56.668
Is that sign language?

33:56.768 --> 34:00.306
When we were younger,
Sonya forced me to learn ASL

34:00.406 --> 34:03.342
so that we could talk trash
about our idiot stepfather

34:03.442 --> 34:04.543
in front of him.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.312
What are you saying to her?

34:07.513 --> 34:09.281
"I love you."

34:10.416 --> 34:12.484
But she's not responding.

34:12.584 --> 34:13.619
Jack...

34:13.719 --> 34:16.755
if her vitals are
any indication,

34:16.855 --> 34:18.724
she's coming back to us.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.626
The man that did this to her...

34:20.726 --> 34:22.294
We're gonna find him.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.500
<i>Feels like a weird time to
learn how to play</i> Shadow Cell.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.935
I need your login.

34:30.035 --> 34:31.103
I tried to get my own,

34:31.203 --> 34:32.638
but they wouldn't
give me access

34:32.738 --> 34:33.739
to the message board.

34:33.839 --> 34:34.840
Should I be offended?

34:34.940 --> 34:36.375
No.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.177
You actually have to play
the game to access the chat.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.645
All right.
No lurking.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.614
So, while the game
is loading...
Mm-hmm.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.616
...you gonna tell me
why you've been avoiding Dad?

34:44.716 --> 34:47.018
He said you haven't been
returning his calls.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.020
I have not been...

34:49.121 --> 34:51.123
Been... I mean...

34:51.223 --> 34:54.025
Okay.
Me and your dad, um...

34:54.126 --> 34:56.027
I don't know. I just,
I mean-- I don't know.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.463
What do you mean
you don't know?
I don't know.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.199
Can we just search "thallium"
with two L's, please?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.235
Okay, we got one.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.671
DymphnasReaper37 said
"thallium" in a chat

35:05.771 --> 35:07.038
three months ago.
Excuse me.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.007
"My favorite metal could
solve every problem

35:09.107 --> 35:10.376
"at Mountain Vista.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.779
"I see 293 problems,
but an MO ain't one.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.014
All they need do
is breathe."

35:16.815 --> 35:18.083
Oh, my God.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.685
This formula
calculates dosage

35:19.785 --> 35:21.720
for his next attack.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.356
It's a mass casualty
event. Joshua!

35:25.991 --> 35:27.293
Mom, what's going on?

35:27.393 --> 35:28.427
Hey, man.
I know what Ron meant

35:28.527 --> 35:29.428
when he said

35:29.528 --> 35:30.696
he was gonna
lighten our load.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.265
He's gonna aerosolize thallium

35:33.365 --> 35:35.701
and poison 293 people,

35:35.801 --> 35:37.102
and I know where--

35:37.203 --> 35:39.471
Mountain Vista
Psychiatric Hospital.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.939
The mental hospital
in Henderson?

35:41.039 --> 35:44.009
Yeah,
they have 293 beds.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.444
If we don't get
there in time,

35:45.544 --> 35:46.845
there will not be
enough body bags

35:46.945 --> 35:48.580
in Clark County.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.682
And we got to get there
by lights out.

36:05.096 --> 36:08.234
This is the most recent photo
of Ron Winter we have.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.535
Keep your eyes peeled.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.802
Yeah, remember,
"lights out," 8:30.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.137
It gives us half an hour
before he--

36:12.238 --> 36:14.139
Atomizes the thallium
and kills us?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.574
Yeah, Catherine's right.
Where's SWAT?

36:15.674 --> 36:16.975
We should be storming
this place.

36:17.075 --> 36:18.810
LVPD has
plain clothes inside.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.579
They're helping staff lead
patients few at a time, but...

36:20.679 --> 36:22.180
any large action
could tip off Ron.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.515
Then? Boom.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.917
If he's smart--
and we know Ron is--

36:26.017 --> 36:28.754
he will put his device
in a vent shaft

36:28.854 --> 36:30.322
and then use the AC
to blow death

36:30.422 --> 36:32.291
all over the
building, okay?

36:32.391 --> 36:34.360
I gave my guys your order.
That's where they're looking.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.727
But I-I got
some pushback.

36:35.827 --> 36:36.928
They don't know why
you're so certain.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.731
Tell them I read
all about it online.

36:47.806 --> 36:50.809
<i>Society has much bigger
problems than that.</i>

36:50.909 --> 36:52.978
<i>Better to flip the table</i>

36:53.078 --> 36:55.547
<i>and knock all the broken pieces
off the board in one fell swoop.</i>

36:55.647 --> 36:57.015
<i>How?</i>

36:57.115 --> 36:58.584
<i>I could brew something special.</i>

36:58.684 --> 37:00.452
<i>Something... expeditious.</i>

37:00.552 --> 37:01.720
<i>Poison.</i>

37:01.820 --> 37:03.889
<i>It's only fair, isn't it?</i>

37:03.989 --> 37:07.326
<i>They infect, they contaminate,</i>

37:07.426 --> 37:09.928
<i>they pollute everyone
they come into contact with.</i>

37:10.028 --> 37:13.365
<i>They are
God's greatest mistakes.</i>

37:19.905 --> 37:21.740
<i>And what do you do
with mistakes?</i>

37:23.309 --> 37:25.076
<i>Erase them.</i>

37:26.244 --> 37:28.847
<i>You know the most delicious
part of my plan?</i>

37:31.750 --> 37:35.120
<i>Once the angel of death has

Hey, Ronnie.

37:59.144 --> 38:00.512
That's him.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.647
I'll cut him off up front!

38:01.747 --> 38:03.649
Hey! Stop!

38:04.783 --> 38:06.184
Law enforcement! Move!

38:07.118 --> 38:09.287
Out of the way, move!

38:10.422 --> 38:11.857
Stop!

38:28.474 --> 38:29.775
You're too late.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.579

38:33.679 --> 38:35.146
Wait, wait.
You have Winter?

38:35.246 --> 38:37.416
We do, but he doesn't have it
on him and he won't talk.

That's less than
a minute, Beau. Come on.

Can you disarm it?
No. Not enough time.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.143
Is it gonna...
No, it held.

39:05.243 --> 39:07.479

We're not gonna touch it, okay?
