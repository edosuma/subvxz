WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.524
Previously onSWAT...

00:02.567 --> 00:04.091
HONDO:
We all knew Thai SWAT were good.

00:04.134 --> 00:05.483
NIRAN: But you didn't think
we were as good

00:05.527 --> 00:06.832
as LAPD SWAT,
the best of the best.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.095
You're sure giving us
a run for our money.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.052
My daughter's in the U.S.
right now.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.445
Pepperdine, in Malibu.

00:10.488 --> 00:11.576
Any plans for the weekend?Gonna head north

00:11.620 --> 00:12.534
to see an old buddy of mine.

00:12.577 --> 00:13.709
Works for the UN's drug

00:13.752 --> 00:15.450
and crime unit on the border.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.060
We've been having an uptick
in L.A. of heroin packages

00:17.104 --> 00:19.193
found in green tea wrappers
just like this one.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.672
Word is,
they come from this region.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.284
[speaking Burmese]

00:25.460 --> 00:26.417
I've been shot.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.810
HONDO:
Come on. Whoa, hey.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.464
You like the Lakers?
Your shirt-- the Lakers.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.336
I promise we will help you.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.208
I want to give you something,
and me giving this to you

00:34.251 --> 00:35.470
means that we're friends.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.080
We need help. Joe...

00:37.124 --> 00:38.125
Get evac.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.256
DEACON:
Hey, Hondo,

00:39.300 --> 00:40.823
say that again. I'm not copying.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.390
Hondo and Joe are AWOL
somewhere in this region.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.609
Now Deacon and Tan
are choppering north

00:44.653 --> 00:46.394
with the Thai SWAT team
to try to locate.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.569
LUCA:
Maybe the local dealer
knows something

00:47.612 --> 00:48.961
about the green tea operation.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.572
STREET:
Where do we find this guy, Lek?

00:50.615 --> 00:52.182
Hey![groans]

00:52.226 --> 00:54.010
Put a bullet right here.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.794
He's my nephew.
My blood runs

00:55.838 --> 00:57.231
through his veins.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.536
What are you waiting for?!

00:58.580 --> 01:00.495
[shouting in Burmese]

01:01.670 --> 01:03.628
SOMCHAI:
They moved everything.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.195
The whole operation-- gone.HONDO:
Then I got to stay here

01:05.239 --> 01:06.718
and help.
I made Thet a promise.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.372
I'm not leaving
until I know he's safe.

01:08.416 --> 01:12.072
We're a team. We're not
leaving here without you.

01:19.601 --> 01:20.906
HONDO:
Hey. You headed back

01:20.950 --> 01:21.777
to the hospital?

01:21.820 --> 01:22.995
Yeah. May's had a long night.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.606
I told her I'd bring her
a change of clothes.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.173
She feeling a little better
now that Joe's out of the woods?

01:26.216 --> 01:30.046
A little. It's been tough,
but she's taking it in stride.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.482
May's a strong woman.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.136
Well, you're a strong
woman, too, babe.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.007
I know it means a lot to May
having you by her side.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.531
Please give my best
to Joe, all right?

01:36.574 --> 01:37.967
I will.All right?

01:38.010 --> 01:40.056
I'll walk you out.Okay.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.059
Zaw Min's quickest line out
of here is if he flees north.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.452
Nah, he won't flee.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.323
Zaw Min's heroin stockpile
is worth millions.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.064
He can't get it
through these mountains.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.457
No way he leaves it behind.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.893
So you think
he'll stick around, then?

01:50.936 --> 01:53.113
I think he doesn't fear a fight.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.202
Tan, what's up?

01:55.245 --> 01:57.682
I know kids can have it rough
anywhere, but, man, these kids?

01:57.726 --> 01:59.249
Abducted from their villages
and parents,

01:59.293 --> 02:00.816
then forced
to pack heroin 15 hours a day?

02:00.859 --> 02:02.252
Yeah. When they're not working,

02:02.296 --> 02:03.601
Zaw Min's keeping 'em
confined somewhere.

02:03.645 --> 02:04.950
They're essentially prisoners.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.691
That's Thet, right there.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.389
And that's got
to be his brother Win.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.086
Thet's the kid
that helped you?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.044
He risked his life doing it.
That's why I got to find him.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.437
That boy saved my life.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.135
I'm not about to let him down.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.919
That doesn't mean
you and Deacon got to stay.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.442
Hey, I already told you-- we
ain't leaving here without you.

02:18.486 --> 02:19.922
We meant that.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.490
Hey. Think we got
a lead on the kids.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.405
Our aerial unit just spotted
some kind of bunkhouse

02:24.448 --> 02:25.928
deep in the foothills.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.669
Several children were reported
in the area.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.105
They're raiding the place
as we speak.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.368
What are we waiting
for? Let's go.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.156
[indistinct chatter]

02:39.376 --> 02:41.073
Thet and his brother
aren't here.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.466
Well, maybe one of
the other kids saw 'em

02:42.510 --> 02:44.294
and knows
where they went.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.557
Somchai has his guys asking
'em right now. No luck so far.

02:46.601 --> 02:49.343
Hey, Hondo,
this boy's name is Denpo.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.605
I think he knows something.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.997
Hey, little man.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.347
You American?Mm-hmm.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.696
Thet say you come.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.001
Do you know Thet?

02:56.045 --> 02:58.047
Do you know
where he is?

02:58.090 --> 02:59.570
Hey.

02:59.614 --> 03:03.835
[speaking Burmese]

03:09.972 --> 03:12.322
He said Thet and his brother
were in their room

03:12.366 --> 03:14.498
when Zaw Min's men came
and took them.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.021
He doesn't know where.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.510
[yells][yells]

03:28.033 --> 03:29.905
Ah.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.994
[laughs]

03:33.952 --> 03:36.651
Pay the lawyer
whatever she asks.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.181
MAN:
[clapping] Come on!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.617
[speaking Burmese]

03:46.661 --> 03:49.403
[men shouting]

03:53.320 --> 03:55.626
Put it in the top.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.759
The boys were all
kept up here.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.370
Aw, Deac, look at this.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.154
[distant shouting]

04:02.198 --> 04:04.722
[flies buzzing]DEACON:
We've seen better prisons.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.901
This is no way
for kids to live.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.034
No. Wait a minute.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.516
This is Thet's.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.692
He left it.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.215
DEACON:
What do you think

04:19.259 --> 04:20.347
that symbol means?

04:20.390 --> 04:22.392
I'm not sure.

04:22.436 --> 04:25.177
Maybe some sort of clue.
Somchai,

04:25.221 --> 04:26.570
does that mean anything to you?

04:26.614 --> 04:29.530
The symbol, I've
never seen before.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.010
But the letters-- I think

04:32.054 --> 04:34.012
he's trying to write
"Krung Thep" in Thai.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.536
It's how we say "Bangkok."

04:35.579 --> 04:37.712
You said that Zaw Min had
a stockpile of heroin.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.409
If he wanted to unload it?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.585
Best place for the best
price would be Bangkok.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.500
Must be where he's headed.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.023
And he took the boys with him.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.634
We got to get back to the city.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.723
â™ª

05:27.805 --> 05:29.459
This drug lord
from the mountains--

05:29.503 --> 05:31.592
do you have proof
that he's here in Bangkok?

05:31.635 --> 05:34.072
Proof, no. But a villager
saw Zaw Min

05:34.116 --> 05:35.770
load drugs onto a truck
near the river.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.511
Now, that truck
and an SUV pulled out

05:37.554 --> 05:39.077
into a southbound byway.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.949
We think Zaw Min's trying
to sell his heroin supply

05:40.992 --> 05:42.254
before he flees.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.692
It's estimated
to be over 200 kilos, sir.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.216
Well, he'd be a fool to bring
that much heroin to our city.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.958
Zaw Min is no fool, but
right now, he is desperate.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.655
He's lost a lot of his men,
and he knows

05:51.699 --> 05:53.265
that UN forces
are flooding the border.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.398
He wants out, but not before
he sells his drugs.

05:55.442 --> 05:59.184
And, sir, he's not just
desperate, he's dangerous.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.751
He'll do anything
to get what he wants.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.754
Is this the drawing
that the boy made?

06:03.798 --> 06:06.104
He left that
for us to find.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.239
"Origin not identified"?

06:10.282 --> 06:12.284
The symbol is
in no known language.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.852
Look, I doubt that Thet ever
learned to read or write.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.463
He only managed to write
a couple letters,

06:16.506 --> 06:18.421
so he drew something.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.118
How old is this boy, Sergeant?

06:20.162 --> 06:22.207
11, 12, maybe,
but the boy is clever.

06:22.251 --> 06:25.515
I'm telling you, this symbol
could be the key to saving him.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.430
And finding
Zaw Min's heroin.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.432
If you're right, then there's
$30 million worth of heroin

06:29.476 --> 06:31.347
somewhere on my streets.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.833
Captain!

06:38.876 --> 06:41.575
What'd he just say?

06:41.618 --> 06:44.360
He said,
"The lead seems promising."

06:44.404 --> 06:47.058
I may not speak Thai,
but I know you're full of it.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.538
[soft chuckle]

06:48.582 --> 06:50.235
Let's just say

06:50.279 --> 06:51.541
I have a friend
who works upstairs

06:51.585 --> 06:53.456
in the narcotics bureau.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.937
And he keeps a file on every
criminal informant in the city.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.462
So, anyone worth talking to,
he'll know.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.949
LEK: What
the hell is that?

07:07.992 --> 07:09.994
STREET:
You work for Zaw Min.

07:10.038 --> 07:13.302
You tell us.[scoffs]

07:13.345 --> 07:15.260
You still haven't
found him.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.871
I don't know what that thing is,

07:16.914 --> 07:19.047
but it won't lead
to anyone in Thailand.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.397
Too bad, because if it did,
maybe the D.A. could give you

07:21.441 --> 07:22.964
a lighter charge
than trafficking.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.922
Detectives uncovered
your base of operation--

07:24.966 --> 07:26.446
apartment over on Hoover?

07:28.752 --> 07:30.188
STREET: Found a few
of these lying around.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.190
Heroin is a
Schedule 1 narcotic

07:32.234 --> 07:33.714
in the U.S.
We got you

07:33.757 --> 07:36.325
on possession, intent,
interstate transport.

07:36.368 --> 07:39.502
I don't know anything
about an apartment on Hoover.

07:39.546 --> 07:43.550
All you have is rumors,
which means you have nothing.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.160
Hey,

07:45.203 --> 07:47.292
where's that sexy little thing
that cuffed me?

07:47.336 --> 07:49.294
She around?

07:49.338 --> 07:52.080
Put me in, sir.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.082
Being arrested
by a woman bruised his ego.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.779
I can use that.
I can crack him.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.259
I don't think
that's necessary.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.826
These two are making
good headway.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.350
They were,
but they're stalling out.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.699
I used to wait tables
at a dive bar.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.309
I know my way
around guys like this.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.050
All their macho BS?

08:06.094 --> 08:08.313
He's dying to get back
at me. It's probably

08:08.357 --> 08:10.968
all he's thought about
since I put him on the ground.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.537
You'd have to walk
a fine line in there.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.234
We need some answers.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.671
I can do this, Commander.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.368
CHINTANA:
Welcome back to the city.

08:19.411 --> 08:22.458
Chintana. I can't tell you
how grateful we are.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.112
There's no way
we'd find Hondo and Joe

08:24.155 --> 08:25.461
if you hadn't arranged
for that chopper.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.854
I'm only sorry
I couldn't be there.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.030
Hondo's friend Joe--
he's okay?

08:29.073 --> 08:30.553
Yeah, he's doing
much better. Thank you.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.946
Doctors are optimistic.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.078
Listen, I know it's not easy

08:34.122 --> 08:35.906
sitting behind a desk when you'd
rather be out in the field.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.734
But what you did?

08:37.778 --> 08:40.607
It saved lives, and
I'm-I'm very grateful for that.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.478
Then I hope
you appreciate this one, too.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.828
I've been doing some digging,
and I may have a lead.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.917
A lead on Zaw Min?No. On this man.

08:46.961 --> 08:50.094
Zaw Min's bodyguard.
His name is Yaza Than.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.096
He's been sighted many times
at a particular go-go bar

08:52.140 --> 08:53.620
in the red-light district.

08:53.663 --> 08:54.925
Seems there's a girl there
he's very fond of.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.361
And seeing her
with other men?

08:56.405 --> 08:57.754
I guess he can't
control his temper.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.364
So you're thinking,
if he's in town...

08:59.408 --> 09:02.063
He won't be able to resist
paying her a visit.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.195
Have you gone
to the commander with this?

09:04.239 --> 09:06.241
If you want to make detective,

09:06.284 --> 09:08.112
this is a great way
to show initiative.

09:08.156 --> 09:11.159
Not if it leads to nothing.
I'll just be wasting his time.

09:11.202 --> 09:14.423
I'll go to the bar,
find the girl.

09:14.466 --> 09:15.816
You know if she's working today?

09:15.859 --> 09:16.947
Yeah. Her shift
is at 7:00.
Okay.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.209
TAN:
Hey. We're rolling.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.210
Somchai and Hondo have a CI

09:19.254 --> 09:20.211
we're gonna talk to.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.431
All right. You go ahead.

09:22.474 --> 09:25.390
Chintana's got another lead.
I think it's worth checking out.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.610
TAN:
Roger that.Yeah.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.656
â™ª

09:33.834 --> 09:35.618
HONDO:
So, how do you know this guy?

09:35.662 --> 09:37.272
SOMCHAI:
He owns a knockoff
clothing store

09:37.315 --> 09:38.665
that used to launder drug money.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.493
Now he work as a bartender
and a CI for us.

09:41.537 --> 09:42.582
People call him "Uan."

09:42.625 --> 09:44.671
Is he cool?Yeah.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.935
My friend at the bureau says
he likes Americans.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.331
Uan?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.333
â™ª

10:09.217 --> 10:11.175
Who you trying to find?

10:13.047 --> 10:15.527
Looking for a drug lord--
Zaw Min.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.225
You're too late.
Zaw Min is dead.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.357
That's just a rumor. He's very
much alive, and he's in town

10:19.401 --> 10:21.098
looking to offload
a large amount of heroin.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.100
We need to know
who he might sell to.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.537
You know why I'm happy
to be out of the drug business?

10:25.581 --> 10:28.671
Long ago, Zaw Min's men asked me
to do his books.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.891
When I refused...

10:30.934 --> 10:32.457
TAN:
How about you get even

10:32.501 --> 10:34.459
by pointing us
in the right direction?

10:36.331 --> 10:38.855
Nice shirt. Where's it from?

10:40.378 --> 10:42.772
No clue. My wife got it for me.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.862
I do not know who is in
the market to buy from Zaw Min,

10:45.906 --> 10:47.734
but I do know something
about his habits.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.997
If I tell you, what do I get?

10:50.040 --> 10:51.694
That depends on what you know.

10:51.738 --> 10:55.176
Zaw Min uses the same courier
whenever he's in Bangkok.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.874
Name is "Ducky."
Delivers messages,

10:57.918 --> 11:00.268
drives them around,
that kind of thing.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.618
What kind of car does he drive?Not a car.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.142
A tuk-tuk. Number 742.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.449
All tuk-tuk in Bangkok have GPS,

11:07.492 --> 11:09.233
so their dispatcher
can track them.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.670
I'll make a call.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.977
Thank you, man.
How can we repay you?

11:14.021 --> 11:16.023
â™ª Baby, be mine...

11:16.066 --> 11:18.286
You serious?

11:20.027 --> 11:22.464
[phone buzzes]Tan. What's up?

11:22.507 --> 11:24.161
TAN:
Somchai's CI gave us a lead

11:24.205 --> 11:25.859
on a tuk-tuk driver tied
to Zaw Min.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.425
We're gonna try
to get a read on his GPS,

11:27.469 --> 11:29.253
see if we can hunt him down.All right.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.386
Chintana and I are heading down
to the red-light district,

11:31.429 --> 11:33.736
see if we can track down
Zaw Min's bodyguard.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.086
Keep in touch.Yeah. Roger that. Will do.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.701
There she is. You just

11:41.744 --> 11:43.615
couldn't get enough of me,
could you?

11:43.659 --> 11:46.096
I got enough to know
you're not at all my type.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.272
So you can knock off whatever
this thing is you're doing.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.274
Why do you have to be like that?

11:50.318 --> 11:52.407
You don't know
what you're missing. [chuckles]

11:52.450 --> 11:54.496
I think I do.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.283
You went down to the ground
awfully easy in that restaurant.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.852
And, to be honest, I like a man
with a little more fight.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.203
Uncuff me and, uh...

12:06.247 --> 12:08.249
you'll get a fight.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.773
Not blaming you, though.

12:10.817 --> 12:14.342
Probably wasn't a lot of room
for girls, growing up as one

12:14.385 --> 12:17.127
of Zaw Min's
boy soldiers?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.781
Had to be rough.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.391
She's kicking
on a hornet's nest.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.958
Zaw Min abused you.Maybe it'll work.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.830
Made you feel powerless.

12:23.873 --> 12:27.268
And now you compensate with
this pathetic macho routine,

12:27.311 --> 12:29.705
thinking that it makes you
bigger somehow.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.274
What's it like being a bitch?

12:33.317 --> 12:35.798
You really want
to impress me, Lek?

12:37.060 --> 12:40.455
And we both know you do.

12:40.498 --> 12:43.806
Show me you've got the balls
to stand up to Zaw Min.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.374
Show me you're not still
the same little boy,

12:46.417 --> 12:49.116
cowering at the
very thought of him.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.206
Go to hell.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.425
You don't know what it's like.

12:54.469 --> 12:57.080
You have the chance here
to flip the table on him.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.473
Be a man.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.085
Tell me how to find him.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.701
He likes to...

13:09.745 --> 13:11.529
What's going on?

13:11.573 --> 13:13.705
Interrogation's over.Ellen Foley.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.055
My client's bail
has been posted.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.839
He's free to go.Are you kidding?

13:16.883 --> 13:19.711
Now, if you please?
I'm late for a lunch.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.279
Unhook him.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.859
Female cop
among all these men.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.949
Which one of us is desperate
to prove something?

13:39.993 --> 13:42.125
HICKS:Get your client out
of here, Ms. Foley.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.826
Keep walking.[chuckles]

13:51.178 --> 13:52.875
I had him right
on the edge.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.311
I just needed
another minute.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.313
You did what you could, Powell.

13:59.273 --> 14:00.665
Hey, Street?

14:00.709 --> 14:02.102
I just remembered

14:02.145 --> 14:03.538
an errand I need to run?

14:03.581 --> 14:05.845
Cover for me, will you?

14:09.370 --> 14:11.328
[indistinct chatter]

14:11.372 --> 14:13.026
TAN:
Looks like we're just

14:13.069 --> 14:14.941
around the corner
from the go-go bar

14:14.984 --> 14:16.812
Deacon and Chintana
are headed to.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.249
Are we sure
that's the right tuk-tuk?

14:19.293 --> 14:21.077
HONDO:
742-- that's the one.

14:21.121 --> 14:24.298
There he is.
If he is working

14:24.341 --> 14:26.474
for Zaw Min, he damn sure
ain't in a hurry.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.389
Maybe we go have
a chat with him.
No.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.044
Hang back. Let's see
what he does.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.266
[indistinct shouting]

14:36.310 --> 14:38.486
What's this girl's name again?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.009
Her name is Aranya.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.098
I'll ask the DJ,
and you check at the bar.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.149
["Ya Ma Yer" by Thaitanium
playing]

14:57.331 --> 14:59.376
Which one's Aranya?

15:04.991 --> 15:06.731
Want to buy me a drink?

15:06.775 --> 15:09.169
No drinks.
Hey, I'm looking for somebody.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.605
You in Bangkok. It's okay.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.085
The drink not too expensive.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.391
No, look, I'm a cop.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.220
We're looking
for one of your regulars.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.700
A man named Yaza Than.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.615
Do you know this man?

15:20.658 --> 15:22.660
Word is, he comes here
a lot just to see you.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.619
Look, we're not
after your boyfriend.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.838
I just want to ask him
some questions about his boss.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.058
He's a very bad man,
a drug lord named Zaw Min?

15:29.102 --> 15:30.799
No drug here. This not allowed.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.192
He might bring that crap here.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.976
I lose my job.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.761
Stop putting on an act

15:36.805 --> 15:39.068
and just answer the question.
Do you know this man?

15:39.112 --> 15:41.114
I never see this man, honey.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.595
[distant shouting]

15:44.639 --> 15:46.989
Who you think
he's texting?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.730
Maybe he's picking someone up.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.039
[laughter]â™ª

15:56.956 --> 15:59.654
[gasps]Sorry.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.048
Aranya, I know you're lying.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.093
I'm not trying
to get you involved.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.486
We just need
to find Yaza Than.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.664
The life of two boys
depends on it.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.319
Don't move![grunts]

16:13.624 --> 16:16.236
Chintana! Found him!

16:18.978 --> 16:20.240
Leave him be!

17:15.208 --> 17:16.644
Bodyguard bailed from the
Cowboy Bar at the back alley.

17:16.687 --> 17:18.341
I'm on him!Okay, copy, Deac. We got it.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.039
You two, take the back alley.
I'll stay on the courier.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.128
Go, go, go.

He's headed

18:03.778 --> 18:05.214
for the go-go bar.There he is!

18:05.258 --> 18:07.042
Police!Police! Don't move!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.131
You don't want
to do it!Go, go, go!

he gets to the main street.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.324
You're done![panting]

19:11.367 --> 19:13.674
Have you seen these kids?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.197
Look at 'em!

19:15.241 --> 19:16.851
Have you seen
these two boys?

19:28.558 --> 19:31.822
[indistinct chatter]

19:37.176 --> 19:40.048
Commander, all due respect,

19:40.091 --> 19:42.224
but Chintana's taking a lot
of the heat that I deserve, too.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.573
We could have avoided
the ruckus at a bar

19:43.617 --> 19:44.966
if she had followed protocol.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.142
We could have
sent in a whole team.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.622
We had no idea what
we were getting into.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.406
And the truth be told,

19:50.450 --> 19:53.235
Chintana got us close
to someone in Zaw Min's orbit.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.019
She helped the case.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.934
She was just trying
to impress you.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.154
Well, she failed to do that.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.983
If the situation were reversed,
and we were in Los Angeles,

20:02.026 --> 20:03.898
I would be careful
to know my place.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.379
Sir, I know I'm a guest,

20:06.422 --> 20:08.424
but I also know
that she deserves a break.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.426
You're right.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.036
You are a guest.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.129
All good with the commander?

20:18.173 --> 20:21.655
Uh... no. No.
He came down

20:21.698 --> 20:23.265
pretty hard on Chintana.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.093
She was just showing initiative,
and I'm pretty sure

20:25.136 --> 20:26.486
if a male cop had done the same,

20:26.529 --> 20:28.575
it'd be
a totally different story.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.577
I remember Chris once said her
loneliest day was her first day

20:30.620 --> 20:32.318
on the force. Never felt
like more of an outsider.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.884
Maybe it's universal.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.582
If that's the case, then...

20:35.625 --> 20:37.279
a lot of good officers
are gonna be overlooked.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.933
Not everyone is cut out
to be a trailblazer

20:38.976 --> 20:41.022
like Chris, but she is.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.199
How'd the interrogation go?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.766
The tuk-tuk driver give up
anything on the boys?

20:45.809 --> 20:48.072
He ain't talking,
but we dug into his files.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.423
Yesterday, two vehicles
entered Bangkok

20:50.466 --> 20:51.946
using his toll road account.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.469
Let me guess,
a box truck and an SUV.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.905
Zaw Min. It's got to be.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.298
I hope his nephews
are in that convoy.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.995
Somchai also dug up
something else.

20:58.039 --> 21:00.476
Before we started tailing
the courier last night,

21:00.520 --> 21:03.392
the tuk-tuk's GPS
went dark for an hour.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.264
Picked back up just on
the other side of the river.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.309
Probably met up with
Zaw Min during that time.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.137
Which means Zaw Min's
somewhere near that river.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.399
Now, if we can
figure out where,

21:10.443 --> 21:12.053
we might be able
to find the boys.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.362
[phone line ringing]

21:16.405 --> 21:17.754
LEK:
Yeah?

21:17.798 --> 21:19.321
ZAW MIN:
The police know I'm in Bangkok.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.888
They are getting too close.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.933
I need the extra leverage
that we discussed.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.195
Yes, sir.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.588
I'm already on it.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.286
I'll call you when I have her.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.985
â™ª

21:38.819 --> 21:41.125
[man speaking Burmese]

22:25.431 --> 22:28.651
Here is where the tuk-tuk GPS
went dark.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.653
And there is where
it picked up again.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.002
Good chance that Zaw Min
is hiding out

22:32.046 --> 22:33.700
somewhere in this area.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.484
This part of the city, how
populated are we talking?

22:35.528 --> 22:37.617
40,000, maybe 50,000 people.

22:37.660 --> 22:38.966
A lot of potential
hiding places.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.055
We got to narrow
it down somehow.

22:41.098 --> 22:43.100
Alleys, loading docks-- plenty
of places to hide a truck.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.537
Is there a
warehouse district?

22:44.580 --> 22:46.408
Yes, here.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.716
Some were converted into bars
and restaurants by developers.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.587
So gentrification
isn't just an American thing.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.328
I might have something.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.417
I've been digging through
property records in the area.

22:55.461 --> 22:58.289
There's a small warehouse,
two blocks from the river,

22:58.333 --> 22:59.900
owned by a Burmese
holding company.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.467
Not much more
information on them.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.207
What's the nature
of the business?

23:03.251 --> 23:04.731
They're listed
as a tea wholesaler.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.559
Zaw Min distributes
his heroin in tea bags.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.777
This guy must think he's clever.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.170
Maybe too clever
for his own good.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.563
Where is this place exactly?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.303
Here.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.741
Streets look tight
in there.
They are.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.178
Wait a minute.

23:17.221 --> 23:18.484
Can you zoom in
on that sign right there?

23:20.311 --> 23:22.096
You guys seeing this?

23:22.139 --> 23:24.272
That's the symbol
Thet left for us.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.405
That's got to be
Zaw Min's hideout.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.710
Let's roll.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.104
Chintana?

23:30.974 --> 23:32.933
That is great detective work.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.199
STREET:
Hey.

23:38.242 --> 23:40.114
How'd your errand go?

23:40.157 --> 23:42.899
Went fine. Why?

23:42.943 --> 23:45.554
I saw the look on your face
after that interrogation.

23:45.598 --> 23:46.947
You had him on the hook,

23:46.990 --> 23:48.252
close to breaking him.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.211
You got to let it go.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.039
And let him start
getting up to no good?

23:52.082 --> 23:53.649
I knew you followed him.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.695
Lek has a direct line
to Zaw Min.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.827
We should be keeping
an eye on him.

23:57.871 --> 23:59.612
We have had this
conversation before.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.048
We work as a team.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.484
Hicks is gonna have your ass

24:02.528 --> 24:03.790
if he knows you're
going off on your own,

24:03.833 --> 24:05.182
doing surveillance.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.097
Look, I'm not breaking any laws.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.839
I just wanted to see
where he was going.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.711
You would've talked me
out of it. Right?

24:11.754 --> 24:14.496
I just want you to do
things by the book.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.845
Be a team player?

24:17.238 --> 24:19.936
Lek's attorney dropped him
off at a car rental place.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.590
Then he rolled out in a van.

24:21.634 --> 24:25.420
I lost him after that,
but it's suspicious, right?

24:26.508 --> 24:27.814
Eh, he could've called
a rideshare,

24:27.857 --> 24:29.468
or rented a sedan...

24:29.511 --> 24:32.340
so, yeah, maybe. Maybe.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.822
That's why the symbol's
not showing up in any database.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.127
It's half faded off.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.564
But that's what Thet
would've remembered

24:38.607 --> 24:40.348
if he had been here before.Little guy's clever.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.958
Not sure I would've
thought of that.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.047
No sign of Zaw Min
or the kids.
You're sure?

24:44.091 --> 24:45.440
Yeah. We cleared
the whole building.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.529
There's no one here.Maybe Thet got it wrong.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.357
HONDO:The kid left the symbol
there for a reason.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.967
This has to be
the right spot.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.537
Wait a minute, Deac.
Check this.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.977
HONDO:
Tan, Somchai.

25:08.811 --> 25:09.899
DEACON:
Clear.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.946
Heroin's gone. Kids, too.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.164
We're in the right place,
we're just too late.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.514
Hey, Hondo.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.559
You said Thet
was a Lakers fan, right?

25:17.603 --> 25:19.953
Look what's written
here in the dust.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.651
SOMCHAI:
8-24?

25:22.695 --> 25:24.218
I don't get it.

25:24.261 --> 25:25.567
8 and 24 were the jerseys
that Kobe Bryant wore

25:25.611 --> 25:27.090
when he played for the Lakers.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.962
That's Thet
trying to draw our attention.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.529
Hey.

25:30.572 --> 25:33.096
This looks like it might
be a dragon, with an arrow.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.055
It's pointed West.

25:35.098 --> 25:37.448
Is there any sort of temple
or dragon statue that direction?

25:37.492 --> 25:39.450
There is a backpacker bar
that way, along the river,

25:39.494 --> 25:41.496
called The Sleeping Dragon.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.411
That's got to be
where the deal's going down.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.674
That's where Zaw Min's got them.
Let's go.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.512
Chintana ran the plates
on the SUV out front.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.906
Same one from the tollbooth,
definitely Zaw Min.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.124
We have to roll now.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.996
SOMCHAI:
Wait a minute.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.388
There are too many civilians
inside.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.389
If we move too soon,

26:05.433 --> 26:07.000
his men
are trigger-happy.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.218
And I saw two armed guards
hanging near a side entrance,

26:08.262 --> 26:09.437
having a smoke.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.612
We got to get to Thet and Win.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.918
They could be running out
of time.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.267
Hondo, we got to case the joint.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.790
We got to get better eyes
on the bar.

26:14.834 --> 26:15.835
We need to know exactly
where those kids are

26:15.878 --> 26:17.053
before we set foot in there.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.620
All right, all right.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.709
It looks popular with tourists.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.319
What if one of us
goes in as a civilian,

26:22.363 --> 26:23.843
tries to get a visual,
see what we're dealing with?

26:23.886 --> 26:25.279
Well, my cover's blown.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.585
He obviously knows
what I look like.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.282
And Zaw Min knows Hondo
on sight.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.544
It's got to be me.

26:34.505 --> 26:35.768
HONDO [over comms]:
Just don't push it, Tan.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.508
Any sign of trouble,
you let us know.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.380
TAN:
Yeah, roger that. Heading in.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.252
Clocking 30 or more civilians.

26:42.296 --> 26:45.081
A lot of innocent lives could
be in danger if things pop off.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.431
HONDO:
Let me know when you got eyes
on our bad guy.

26:47.475 --> 26:48.911
[music playing in background]

26:48.955 --> 26:50.739
Haven't spotted any of them
in the main area.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.611
Gonna try the back.Tan, be careful.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.003
Do not get made.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.223
[quietly]:
Excuse me.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.312
[overlapping chatter]

27:04.231 --> 27:06.276
Hey, bathroom?
[speaks Thai]
Mm.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.933
TAN:
One gunman on the three side.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.250
Eyes on Zaw Min, storage room

27:23.293 --> 27:24.773
in the back of the bar.

27:24.817 --> 27:25.992
Looks like the deal's
going down right now.

27:33.173 --> 27:34.653
HONDO: What about Thet?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.742
Are the boys in there?TAN: Can't see 'em.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.047
Eh.

27:40.528 --> 27:41.964
Wait. He's here, Hondo.

27:50.277 --> 27:52.366
Hey.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.248
I see Thet and Win.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.163
They're both here, Hondo.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.556
Are you in position
to get to them?No.

28:08.599 --> 28:09.905
Need to get closer.

28:18.958 --> 28:19.915
[Win cries out]

28:19.959 --> 28:21.351
[men speaking Burmese]

28:21.395 --> 28:23.658
[Zaw Min speaks Burmese]

28:25.268 --> 28:27.357
â™ª

28:27.401 --> 28:29.229
Move in, Hondo. Cover now.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.755
[screaming]

28:33.799 --> 28:34.887
[men speaking Burmese]

28:36.497 --> 28:39.195
Get down on the ground!
Everyone down!

28:39.239 --> 28:41.110
Move, move! Get out of here!Get down on the ground!

28:41.154 --> 28:43.547
Get down! Stay low!
Move, move, move!Stay down on the ground!

28:43.591 --> 28:45.027
On the floor! Down!

28:45.071 --> 28:46.855
Everybody, down on the ground!Move, move!

28:47.813 --> 28:50.076
[people screaming]

28:53.079 --> 28:54.123
[grunts]

28:58.737 --> 28:59.825
[grunts]

29:01.217 --> 29:02.262
[grunts]

29:05.352 --> 29:06.919
[grunting]

29:09.660 --> 29:10.705
[grunts]

29:24.327 --> 29:26.765
Hey. You all right, buddy?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.291
Hondo! Back here!

29:31.334 --> 29:32.814
Come on.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.294
Take the kid.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.122
Zaw Min's got Thet.
He went that way.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.210
HONDO:
Deacon, with me!

29:41.867 --> 29:43.651
ZAW MIN:
Get in there and keep quiet.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.399
It's over, Zaw Min! Give it up!

29:52.442 --> 29:54.923
Sergeant Harrelson, you just
don't know when to stop, huh?

29:54.967 --> 29:57.056
You got that right, I don't!

29:57.099 --> 29:58.797
Now you let the kid go!

29:58.840 --> 30:00.233
There's no way out!

30:00.276 --> 30:02.670
You think you hold
all the cards. But you don't!

30:02.713 --> 30:03.714
What does he mean by that?DEACON: No idea.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.412
But we got to get in there fast.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.196
What kind of cards you think
you're holding, Zaw Min?

30:07.240 --> 30:08.458
[phone ringing]

30:08.502 --> 30:10.243
It's not a good time, honey.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.245
LEK:
Afraid your little girl's
unavailable right now.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.855
Who is this?

30:13.899 --> 30:15.683
Where's my daughter?

30:16.684 --> 30:18.294
Drone's got to be
overhead by now.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.469
Infrared puts Zaw Min
in the middle of the room.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.906
Thet is tucked
in the far corner.

30:20.949 --> 30:21.820
It's not gonna get
any better than that.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.865
We got to move now.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.346
It's your last chance, Zaw Min!

30:26.389 --> 30:28.000
You come out peacefully,
nobody gets hurt!

30:28.043 --> 30:30.263
Did you enjoy your time here
in Thailand?!

30:30.306 --> 30:34.528
'Cause all you did was screw up
a perfectly good business!

30:34.571 --> 30:36.051
And you got your friend shot!

30:38.445 --> 30:40.621
Everyone set? On my count.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.753
Three, two...Wait, wait, wait.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.668
Everybody stop.HONDO: What's going on?

30:44.712 --> 30:46.148
We've been ordered
to stand down.

30:46.192 --> 30:47.671
Ordered? Ordered by who?It's Commander Niran.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.412
His daughter's in L.A.
She's been kidnapped,

30:49.456 --> 30:51.632
and she will be killed
if you don't back off

30:51.675 --> 30:52.938
and let Zaw Min go.Looks like I'm in charge now!

30:52.981 --> 30:55.114
[phone rings, buzzes]

30:59.945 --> 31:01.642
All right, listen up.

31:02.686 --> 31:04.863
All right, the team's here,
Hondo. Go ahead.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.603
We have Zaw Min cornered,
but he managed

31:06.647 --> 31:07.866
to get Commander Niran's
daughter kidnapped

31:07.909 --> 31:09.389
out there in L.A.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.043
Her name's Nikki.
She's a student at Pepperdine.

31:11.086 --> 31:14.089
Okay, this drug lord has all
the leverage. What's he want?

31:14.133 --> 31:15.917
To get out of here scot-free,
I'm guessing.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.267
Look, if I can stall him,
can you find this girl?

31:18.311 --> 31:20.226
Yeah, you know we'll try, Hondo,
but that's the best we can do.

31:20.269 --> 31:21.314
Then do it.

31:21.357 --> 31:22.619
I've got to go.

31:22.663 --> 31:23.969
It's got to be Lek
who grabbed her.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.796
He's Zaw Min's
right-hand man in L.A.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.408
No wonder that son of a bitch
got bailed out so quickly.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.800
Let's get out a BOLO.

31:29.844 --> 31:31.585
Stevens, put his picture
in every patrol car.

31:31.628 --> 31:32.934
I'm gonna call his attorney
and pray to God

31:32.978 --> 31:34.501
she still has a conscience.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.807
Actually, Commander,
there might be a better way.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.898
After he left here,
Lek went and rented a van.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.813
And how do you know that?I kept tabs on him, sir.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.599
[scoffs]
We both did.

31:45.642 --> 31:46.992
The rental van's got a GPS.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.254
Shouldn't take long
to track it down.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.125
I'll want answers later.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.692
Right now, find that van.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.175
He's demanding a speedboat.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.351
He wants it brought up
right to the dock.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.787
Locals don't have
any kind of shore patrol.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.354
If Zaw Min hits open water,
he's gone.

32:01.397 --> 32:02.703
And then Thet's gone, too.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.313
Look, my team back in L.A.

32:04.357 --> 32:05.836
is doing all they can to find
the commander's daughter,

32:05.880 --> 32:07.708
but I need you
to stall that boat.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.666
Look, I'll do what I can,
but every minute we wait,

32:09.710 --> 32:11.538
Commander Niran's daughter
is in danger.

32:11.581 --> 32:15.629
Just to be clear, taking me out
won't do you any good!

32:15.672 --> 32:18.153
If I don't call my friend
from international water

32:18.197 --> 32:20.764
before the sundown,
the girl dies!

32:20.808 --> 32:22.114
Okay, we hear you, Zaw Min.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.767
We're working on the boat.

32:23.811 --> 32:26.118
Just give us some time.You're taking too long!

32:26.161 --> 32:29.773
Your commander will be
burying his daughter in pieces!

32:29.817 --> 32:31.427
Do you understand me?!

32:31.471 --> 32:32.776
Get me my boat!

He's turning on Thet.
He knows Thet helped you.

32:48.705 --> 32:50.359
Huh?

32:57.236 --> 32:59.281
Huh?!

33:05.984 --> 33:08.464
Okay, Zaw Min,
the boat's almost here.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.163
You can come out now.

33:11.206 --> 33:13.992
Everybody, stand down.

33:14.993 --> 33:19.345
Now, remember, if I don't
make the call, the girl dies.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.042
Don't do anything.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.131

We're just gonna stand
here and watch him go?

33:23.175 --> 33:25.264

It's the only way to keep the
commander's daughter alive.

33:33.272 --> 33:34.751
Look, we need to hit Lek
by surprise

33:34.795 --> 33:36.405
so he doesn't have a chance
to hurt the girl.

33:36.449 --> 33:37.972
Yeah, if he hasn't already.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.843
How are things looking
on the Thai side?

33:39.887 --> 33:41.106
Forget that. It's up to us now.

I can't.
It'll be here any minute.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.773

when I bring them in!

36:13.736 --> 36:15.695
Either they work,
or they die!

My nephew never had
to make that choice!

He still is!

No, he's not anymore!

He betrayed me!

up to something,

37:27.723 --> 37:29.986
that another shoe
might drop.

goes a long way.

I don't hand out

37:42.782 --> 37:44.958
You do,

is because you're unique.

by you guys...Yeah.

the right side of the line.

for you today,

gonna dry up...

very welcome.

I'm not sure how much weight
my recommendation will carry,

39:29.323 --> 39:30.716

39:30.759 --> 39:32.848
In the brief time
I worked with her,

39:32.892 --> 39:35.024
she deserves a shot
at making detective.

Well, she said that,
uh, the commander

the chief, so, thanks to you,

after all.

great to hear.

what I expected

for our teams.

back with us,

given us a chance

40:17.240 --> 40:18.633
to show off a little bit,

40:18.677 --> 40:21.462
but I learned that LAPD SWAT
is one of the best,

40:21.506 --> 40:23.464
not because of all your gak
and training

40:23.508 --> 40:25.814
but because you guys treat
each other like family.

of that family, too.
