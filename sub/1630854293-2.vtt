We all knew Thai SWAT were good.

NIRAN: But you didn't think
we were as good

00:05.527 --> 00:06.832
as LAPD SWAT,

You're sure giving us
a run for our money.

Any plans for the weekend?Gonna head north

Works for the UN's drug

We've been having an uptick
in L.A. of heroin packages

found in green tea wrappers
just like this one.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.672
Word is,
they come from this region.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.208
I want to give you something,
and me giving this to you

00:34.251 --> 00:35.470
means that we're friends.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.390
Hondo and Joe are AWOL
somewhere in this region.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.609
Now Deacon and Tan
are choppering north

00:44.653 --> 00:46.394

Maybe the local dealer
knows something

00:47.612 --> 00:48.961
about the green tea operation.

Then I got to stay here

01:05.239 --> 01:06.718
and help.
I made Thet a promise.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.372
I'm not leaving
until I know he's safe.

01:08.416 --> 01:12.072
We're a team. We're not
leaving here without you.

Hey. You headed back

01:20.950 --> 01:21.777
to the hospital?

01:21.820 --> 01:22.995
Yeah. May's had a long night.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.606
I told her I'd bring her
a change of clothes.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.173
She feeling a little better
now that Joe's out of the woods?

01:26.216 --> 01:30.046
A little. It's been tough,
but she's taking it in stride.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.482
May's a strong woman.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.136
Well, you're a strong
woman, too, babe.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.007
I know it means a lot to May
having you by her side.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.531
Please give my best
to Joe, all right?

01:36.574 --> 01:37.967
I will.All right?

01:38.010 --> 01:40.056
I'll walk you out.Okay.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.059
Zaw Min's quickest line out
of here is if he flees north.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.452
Nah, he won't flee.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.323
Zaw Min's heroin stockpile
is worth millions.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.064
He can't get it
through these mountains.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.457
No way he leaves it behind.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.893
So you think
he'll stick around, then?

01:50.936 --> 01:53.113
I think he doesn't fear a fight.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.202
Tan, what's up?

01:55.245 --> 01:57.682
I know kids can have it rough
anywhere, but, man, these kids?

01:57.726 --> 01:59.249
Abducted from their villages
and parents,

01:59.293 --> 02:00.816
then forced
to pack heroin 15 hours a day?

02:00.859 --> 02:02.252
Yeah. When they're not working,

02:02.296 --> 02:03.601
Zaw Min's keeping 'em
confined somewhere.

02:03.645 --> 02:04.950
They're essentially prisoners.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.691
That's Thet, right there.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.389
And that's got
to be his brother Win.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.086
Thet's the kid
that helped you?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.044
He risked his life doing it.
That's why I got to find him.

That boy saved my life.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.135
I'm not about to let him down.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.919
That doesn't mean
you and Deacon got to stay.

Hey, I already told you-- we
ain't leaving here without you.

02:18.486 --> 02:19.922
We meant that.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.490
Hey. Think we got
a lead on the kids.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.405
Our aerial unit just spotted
some kind of bunkhouse

02:24.448 --> 02:25.928

02:25.971 --> 02:27.669
Several children were reported
in the area.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.105
They're raiding the place
as we speak.

for? Let's go.

aren't here.

the other kids saw 'em

02:42.510 --> 02:44.294

where they went.

that symbol means?

04:22.436 --> 04:25.177
Maybe some sort of clue.
Somchai,

04:25.221 --> 04:26.570
does that mean anything to you?

04:26.614 --> 04:29.530
The symbol, I've
never seen before.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.010
But the letters-- I think

04:32.054 --> 04:34.012
he's trying to write
"Krung Thep" in Thai.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.536
It's how we say "Bangkok."

04:35.579 --> 04:37.712
You said that Zaw Min had
a stockpile of heroin.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.409
If he wanted to unload it?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.585
Best place for the best
price would be Bangkok.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.500
Must be where he's headed.

And he took the boys with him.

do you have proof
that he's here in Bangkok?

05:31.635 --> 05:34.072
Proof, no. But a villager
saw Zaw Min

05:34.116 --> 05:35.770
load drugs onto a truck
near the river.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.511
Now, that truck
and an SUV pulled out

05:37.554 --> 05:39.077
into a southbound byway.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.949
We think Zaw Min's trying
to sell his heroin supply

05:40.992 --> 05:42.254

05:42.298 --> 05:44.692
It's estimated
to be over 200 kilos, sir.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.216
Well, he'd be a fool to bring
that much heroin to our city.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.958
Zaw Min is no fool, but
right now, he is desperate.

and he knows

are flooding the border.

He wants out, but not before
he sells his drugs.

And, sir, he's not just
desperate, he's dangerous.

He'll do anything
to get what he wants.

in no known language.

learned to read or write.

He only managed to write
a couple letters,

06:16.506 --> 06:18.421

How old is this boy, Sergeant?

11, 12, maybe,
but the boy is clever.

could be the key to saving him.

And finding
Zaw Min's heroin.

but it won't lead
to anyone in Thailand.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.397
Too bad, because if it did,
maybe the D.A. could give you

than trafficking.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.080
Put me in, sir.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.082

by a woman bruised his ego.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.779
I can use that.
I can crack him.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.259
I don't think
that's necessary.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.826
These two are making
good headway.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.350
They were,
but they're stalling out.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.699
I used to wait tables
at a dive bar.

around guys like this.

since I put him on the ground.

a fine line in there.

We need some answers.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.671
I can do this, Commander.

for that chopper.

much better. Thank you.

It saved lives, and
I'm-I'm very grateful for that.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.478
Then I hope
you appreciate this one, too.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.828

His name is Yaza Than.

He's been sighted many times
at a particular go-go bar

08:52.140 --> 08:53.620
in the red-light district.

08:53.663 --> 08:54.925
Seems there's a girl there
he's very fond of.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.361
And seeing her
with other men?

08:56.405 --> 08:57.754
I guess he can't
control his temper.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.364
So you're thinking,
if he's in town...

08:59.408 --> 09:02.063
He won't be able to resist
paying her a visit.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.195
Have you gone
to the commander with this?

09:04.239 --> 09:06.241
If you want to make detective,

09:06.284 --> 09:08.112
this is a great way
to show initiative.
