WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:08.921
The killer is still out there.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.489
I want you to
help me find him.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.230
NSA's intel was correct.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.189
I did it. I leaked that file.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.233
Vance fired her?

00:16.277 --> 00:17.539
No. She quit.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.845
Who were you training for?
CIA? Homeland?

00:19.889 --> 00:22.631
Because that's why you threw
your reputation in the toilet.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.024
Goodbye, Nick.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.377
So now there are three.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.205
This is starting
to look like a...

00:31.248 --> 00:32.249
Serial killer.

00:32.293 --> 00:35.078
I found a bug in my basement.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.384
Do you think it's the killer?

00:36.427 --> 00:38.473
I don't know, but if they're
watching me, Marcie,

00:38.516 --> 00:40.170
they're watching you.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.822
I wish all of my final
walk-throughs were this easy.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.782
Miss Bishop seems
to have covered all her bases

02:53.825 --> 02:55.175
before leaving.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.002
It's great.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.831
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't know
someone was out here.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.572
Would you like a tour?

03:01.616 --> 03:03.357
This unit just became available.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.097
Yeah, I can see that.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.664
Nick?

03:07.709 --> 03:08.884
Jimmy.

03:10.538 --> 03:11.756
Uh...

03:11.800 --> 03:14.063
I'll go grab a brochure.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.503
Nick, I know how this must look,

03:19.547 --> 03:21.897
but, I swear, it's not like
I was helping Ellie move out

03:21.940 --> 03:24.247
without you knowing
or something.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.379
She called me last night,

03:25.422 --> 03:26.728
asked if I would meet
with her landlady.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.991
I thought
I was doing her a favor.

03:29.034 --> 03:32.473
I did not expect this.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.691
Although,
from the look of things,

03:33.735 --> 03:35.563
it seems like
she's been planning this

03:35.606 --> 03:37.521
for quite a while.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.961
Like, did she ever tell you why?

04:08.726 --> 04:10.902
You were keeping a handgun here?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.646
Guess you guys just blew
right past the toothbrush phase.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.605
This stays between us, okay?

04:17.648 --> 04:19.259
Yeah.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.826
Hey, Jimmy?

04:21.870 --> 04:23.741
Why didn't she come herself?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.268
You can tell me.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.576
When she called me last night,

04:32.620 --> 04:35.362
she was already headed
to the airport.

04:35.405 --> 04:38.147
To catch a flight
out of the country.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.324
She's gone, Nick.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.760
No.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.720
She left.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.852
Look, if you ever want
to talk...
Mm-mm.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.727
I'm fine.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.208
I'm sorry, pal.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.220
Yeah, Tim.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.874
Slow down, slow down.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.400
What lake?

05:16.359 --> 05:17.926
We didn't make the connection
to NCIS

05:17.969 --> 05:20.276
- until early this morning.
- What took so long?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.583
Easy there, city mouse.

05:22.626 --> 05:26.064
It's a lake.
Evidence, you know... sinks.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.893
Witnesses reported hearing an
explosion and seeing smoke,

05:28.937 --> 05:30.895
but by the time
rescue craft arrived,

05:30.939 --> 05:33.245
everything that could help us
ID the boat or its owner

05:33.289 --> 05:35.378
- was already gone.
- You found any survivors?

05:35.422 --> 05:37.032
No survivors. No bodies.

05:37.075 --> 05:40.078
But according to marina records,
the only boat unaccounted for

05:40.122 --> 05:42.254
was registered
to an L.J. Gibbs.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.169
Look, we don't mean to do
your job for you.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.823
Give it time.
You Feds always take over.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.216
But we...

05:47.259 --> 05:49.392
we need to make sure that
it's our L.J. Gibbs, okay?

05:49.436 --> 05:50.480
Well, does your guy own a boat?

05:50.524 --> 05:53.788
Yes. But he built it
in a basement.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.443
How did he get it out?

06:00.055 --> 06:02.100
This is what we've been able
to recover so far.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.972
Anything look
familiar?

06:07.715 --> 06:09.369
Looks like
the initial blast came

06:09.412 --> 06:11.153
from the engine compartment.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.894
It'd take a lot
of concentrated heat

06:12.937 --> 06:14.374
to melt cast iron like that.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.636
Mechanical failure?

06:15.679 --> 06:17.333
Pipe bomb.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.296
What's Rule 91?

06:27.474 --> 06:29.389
Gibbs.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.479
You saying
this is definitely your guy?

06:32.522 --> 06:34.002
We're saying
this is definitely our case.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.746
I get it. He's your boss.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.704
No. He's family.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.622
We got divers dragging
the bottom in shifts,

06:45.666 --> 06:47.102
a-and teams

06:47.145 --> 06:48.451
sweeping the shore
in every direction.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.019
If Gibbs is out there,
we'll find him.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.934
Unger.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.631
Yeah.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.416
Copy that.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.853
Divers just found a body.

07:28.752 --> 07:29.840
Looks like she's been in

07:29.884 --> 07:30.885
the water
a little while.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.539
You ever seen this woman before?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.150
No.

07:35.193 --> 07:38.153
Boat bombs and bodies...

07:38.196 --> 07:40.416
What's this Gibbs guy
mixed up in?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.723
We're gonna find out.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.768
And we're gonna find him.

07:54.865 --> 07:58.652
Okay, so southwest quadrants
six and nine have been cleared.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.437
Moving on
to southeast four and five.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.700
Copy that. Thanks, Victor.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.877
Hey. What's this?

08:06.921 --> 08:09.184
Just keeping tabs on the
rescue efforts up at the lake,

08:09.227 --> 08:10.533
thanks to some rescue divers

08:10.577 --> 08:12.317
that play in my indoor
volleyball league.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.624
I'm a medical examiner.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.321
I know people who find bodies.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.802
Fortunately, they haven't found
any more of those,

08:18.846 --> 08:20.804
but the search teams
on land have found

08:20.848 --> 08:22.545
absolutely no trace
of Gibbs, either.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.373
It's not like Gibbs
just absorbed

08:24.416 --> 08:26.157
back into nature, right?

08:26.201 --> 08:27.289
- Jimmy?
- Hmm?

08:27.332 --> 08:28.812
Let's focus on what we know.

08:28.856 --> 08:32.642
Right. The mystery body found
in southwest quadrant four.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.602
Uh, female,
approximately 30 years old.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.212
Still no hits on, uh,

08:37.255 --> 08:38.518
fingerprints,
facial recognition?

08:38.561 --> 08:40.258
No, and no connection
to Gibbs yet.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.782
Assuming they're
even connected.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.958
Dead body in the lake
where Gibbs' boat blew up?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.437
they're connected.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.789
Speaking of rules,
what is Rule 91?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.574
It's one
of the more complicated ones.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.662
Mm.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.577
You have no idea, do you?

08:54.621 --> 08:56.318
No. Body.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.581
Right. Uh, I removed
some red duct tape

08:58.625 --> 09:01.062
that was binding
both her wrists and her ankles.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.585
And cause of death was

09:02.629 --> 09:04.674
blunt force trauma
with a claw hammer.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.067
This is definitely a murder.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.591
Time of death?
It's very
hard to say,

09:08.635 --> 09:11.986
but based on water temperature
and the state of decomposition,

09:12.029 --> 09:14.597
I'd say her body was dumped
at least two weeks ago.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.643
Okay, so we'll start pulling
missing person reports

09:16.686 --> 09:17.774
from last month.

09:17.818 --> 09:18.862
Thanks, Jimmy.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.430
Uh, hey, uh, McGee?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.173
How are you doing?

09:25.216 --> 09:27.218
I mean, first Bishop, now this.

09:27.262 --> 09:30.221
I know there hasn't been
a lot of time to process.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.266
I'm fine.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.920
That's just what Nick said,

09:32.963 --> 09:35.052
but I didn't believe him,
either.

09:35.096 --> 09:37.228
Now, look, I-I really feel
like we should, uh,

09:37.272 --> 09:38.621
we should vent.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.885
Jimmy, after we find Gibbs.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.583
He's alive, Tim.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.414
This isn't how it ends.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.354
Help!

11:01.051 --> 11:03.314
I'm here!

11:03.358 --> 11:05.012
Help me!

11:05.055 --> 11:07.057
Let me out of here!

11:19.635 --> 11:21.593
We're sorry.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.335
You have reached a number
that has been disconnect...

11:24.379 --> 11:26.555
Anything on our mystery woman?

11:26.598 --> 11:27.817
What?

11:27.861 --> 11:29.036
Our mystery woman.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.038
Any luck with the
missing persons reports?

11:31.081 --> 11:32.517
I never got 'em.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.696
Well, that's funny, because,
according to the read receipts,

11:36.739 --> 11:39.220
the email I sent was opened
27 minutes ago.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.525
Well, then your program
is wrong.

11:40.569 --> 11:41.744
Computers don't lie, Nick.

11:41.788 --> 11:42.745
Neither do I.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.181
That's not what I mean.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.836
Look, I... I know that you
and Bishop, you were...

11:46.880 --> 11:48.185
We what, huh?

11:48.229 --> 11:50.274
- You were close.
- So?

11:50.318 --> 11:51.928
So maybe you should
take a step back.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.800
Maybe you should take
a break on this one.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.236
I can do my damn job, Tim.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.759
That's not what I mean.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.805
- Then say what you mean!
- I wish I could!

11:58.848 --> 12:00.937
But with Bishop gone
and Gibbs missing,

12:00.981 --> 12:02.373
I feel like things
are falling apart.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.071
Okay?
And I can't think straight.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.116
- I know!
- Then why are you still yelling?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.075
Because it feels good!

12:16.779 --> 12:18.346
Well, that happened
kind of fast.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.565
- Right.
- Come on, bring it in.

12:20.609 --> 12:21.958
What? No, we're not hugging.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.786
Oh, I will.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.657
- Oh.
- Oh, gosh.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.790
It's been a rough couple days.

12:27.834 --> 12:28.835
Oh...

12:28.878 --> 12:29.923
Okay.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.099
Yeah.

12:32.142 --> 12:35.276
Also, I have to take the love
while it's still available.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.844
What is that supposed to mean?

12:37.887 --> 12:40.672
You gave Gibbs an electronic bug
finder and you didn't tell us?

12:40.716 --> 12:43.545
Only because he specifically
said he wasn't in trouble.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.895
And the next day
his boat blew up.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.376
In retrospect,
Gibbs may have been in trouble.

12:48.419 --> 12:51.074
- You think?
- The man asked for a favor.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.293
Did he say who was bugging him?

12:52.336 --> 12:53.294
Or why?

12:53.337 --> 12:54.991
No. He just told me

12:55.035 --> 12:57.254
to enjoy my ginger ale
and walked out.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.516
You don't even like ginger ale.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.868
One of many mistakes
I made that day. But...

13:01.911 --> 13:04.261
I might be able to make up
for some of them.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.568
Gibbs may have said
he wasn't in trouble,

13:06.611 --> 13:07.569
but I know better.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.092
After all, Gibbs is Gibbs.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.094
So before I gave him
the bug finder,

13:11.138 --> 13:12.617
I installed
one of these puppies.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.923
A mesh Bluetooth
tracking device.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.795
- Smart.
- And frugal.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.797
That bug finder is
NCIS property.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.016
It gets lost,
it comes out of my paycheck.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.801
Does that mean we
can track Gibbs?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.019
The device
is currently turned off.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.368
No way to tell where it is.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.283
No, but we can find out
where it's been.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.546
You mean by downloading
GPS tracking data

13:28.590 --> 13:30.853
from the cloud server?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.594
Already started downloading.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.639
We may not know

13:34.683 --> 13:36.511
why Gibbs was using
the bug finder,

13:36.554 --> 13:38.295
but in a minute,
we'll be able to see

13:38.339 --> 13:40.820
exactly where
he was using it.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.617
Ow.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.581
Just where the hell
do you think you're going?

14:55.068 --> 14:57.026
Get up.

14:58.767 --> 15:02.336
And before you think
about running rabbit,

15:02.379 --> 15:03.946
I will not hesitate

15:03.990 --> 15:05.165
to end you.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.080
Cripes, Thelma,

15:07.123 --> 15:08.951
he's lost
a lot of blood.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.779
He-He's not going anywhere.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.433
He broke the door latch.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.435
Well, i-impressive,

15:14.478 --> 15:15.610
but not too smart.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.526
My shirt looks good
on you, though.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.658
So, who are you?

15:20.702 --> 15:22.747
Gibbs.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.271
Put the rifle away.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.968
I'm not looking for trouble.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.622
That's funny,

15:27.665 --> 15:30.059
coming from somebody
whose boat just blew up.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.627
Yeah, either you're
a terrible mechanic,

15:32.670 --> 15:34.063
or somebody wants you dead.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.847
In any case,

15:35.891 --> 15:37.588
you ain't a guy
I want to know.

15:37.632 --> 15:38.981
How long have I been out?

15:39.025 --> 15:41.766
Since yesterday.
Uh, we were on a walk

15:41.810 --> 15:44.334
and saw you swim
into the shallows,

15:44.378 --> 15:45.901
so we tried to help.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.034
That was our first mistake.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.992
You were
in pretty bad shape.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.777
I knew we weren't gonna
get up to the hospital.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.997
I'm-- I'm a retired
veterinarian,

15:55.041 --> 15:58.000
so I just figured, uh,
see, if I could patch a horse,

15:58.044 --> 15:59.741
I could patch you.

15:59.784 --> 16:02.439
That was our second mistake.

16:02.483 --> 16:03.963
I need to make a phone call.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.617
Somebody's life's in danger.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.402
Then how come you said,
"No cops"?

16:08.445 --> 16:10.230
Yeah, those are
the last words you used

16:10.273 --> 16:11.883
before you passed out.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.668
You're part
of that gang

16:13.711 --> 16:15.278
up to no good
at the North Shore,

16:15.322 --> 16:17.846
and the last thing you want
is cops sniffing around.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.026
Sit down.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.550
Gonna be hard
to make any calls

16:26.594 --> 16:27.943
with a hole in your head.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.901
Lady, you have no idea

16:29.945 --> 16:31.468
what you're in the middle of.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.687
Is that so?

16:32.730 --> 16:34.558
How about you
enlighten us?

16:39.085 --> 16:40.695
After an initial sweep

16:40.738 --> 16:43.132
of the shoreline,
NCIS and county police

16:43.176 --> 16:44.612
have moved the search
further inland.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.092
Still no sign of Gibbs.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.789
- But we're working on
a lead of our own.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.834
It's come to our attention
that Gibbs has been using

16:49.878 --> 16:52.446
a piece of equipment that has
a tracking device inside.

16:52.489 --> 16:55.144
That bug finder
that Miss Hines released

16:55.188 --> 16:57.233
without proper authorization.

16:58.626 --> 16:59.931
She sent a full email confession

16:59.975 --> 17:01.759
- right before you came up.
- Well, GPS history

17:01.803 --> 17:03.065
shows that Gibbs

17:03.109 --> 17:05.763
used the device
at three specific locations.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.983
First was at the diner
when Kasie handed it over.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.593
And the second was at his house.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.378
All right, I understand
those two, but...

17:11.421 --> 17:13.728
what's this third location
downtown?

17:13.771 --> 17:16.165
It's an industrial loft owned
by a furniture store.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.212
What, was Gibbs buying a sofa?

17:19.255 --> 17:20.865
We'll find out, sir.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.043
I wasn't finished.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.440
First, I want to say good work.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.095
These last few days have not
been easy for any of us.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.531
And understandably,

17:34.575 --> 17:37.099
emotions are
running high.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.319
Sir, if this is about
the outburst in the bullpen...

17:39.362 --> 17:40.537
Yes.

17:40.581 --> 17:41.669
It is.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.453
We already worked through that.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.108
So, sir,
it won't ever happen again.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.719
And I'm gonna do my part
to make sure it stays that way.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.504
You've been overworked
and understaffed,

17:50.547 --> 17:53.376
which is why I'm gonna assign
your team a new agent.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.161
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.859
Please.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.081
Agents McGee
and Torres,

18:02.124 --> 18:04.387
I'd like for you to meet
Special Agent Brent Hollister.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.955
Good to meet you.
- Right.
- Yeah.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.088
Agent Hollister is one of
our best and brightest.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.655
He just graduated top
of his class at FLETC.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.744
Director, all due respect,
we don't have time for this.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.095
If we're gonna find Gibbs,
we need someone who is

18:16.138 --> 18:17.096
independent

18:17.139 --> 18:18.793
and capable and experienced.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.099
No offense.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.971
I don't suppose
you and Agent Torres

18:23.014 --> 18:24.538
have someone else in mind?

18:26.627 --> 18:28.368
<i>NCIS! Open up!</i>

18:38.769 --> 18:40.162
Clear.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.557
Cute office.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.776
Well, someone didn't think so.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.910
I really want to find out where
they got these throw pillows.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.826
You're a pillow person,
Agent Knight?

18:51.869 --> 18:53.088
No.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.090
Stains on my couch
that need hiding.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.006
Place doesn't seem very...
Gibbs-ish.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.182
Well, the man is not much
of a pillow guy.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.618
What would he be doing here?

19:01.662 --> 19:03.490
Or who would he
be doing it with?

19:03.533 --> 19:05.100
Does Gibbs have
a girlfriend?

19:06.057 --> 19:07.842
- Huh.
- Just saying.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.626
There could be definite
"love shack" vibes here.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.324
Yeah, but I don't
see a bed here.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.326
Somebody has not seen <i>
Fatal Attraction.</i>

19:14.501 --> 19:17.547
And, hey, before I forget,
I just...

19:17.591 --> 19:19.462
wanted to say
thank you for...

19:19.506 --> 19:21.551
going to bat for me with Vance.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.684
I know it's only temporary
until we find Gibbs...

19:23.727 --> 19:27.122
...but it's nice
to be kicking down doors again.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.646
Ooh. I think I know
whose door this is.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.258
Press credential says
"Marcie Warren."

19:32.301 --> 19:33.781
Does Gibbs

19:33.824 --> 19:35.174
usually get cozy with the press?

19:35.217 --> 19:37.437
No, and especially not this one.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.655
You know this Marcie woman?

19:38.699 --> 19:40.875
By reputation only.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.442
She's the reporter
that wrote the exposé

19:42.485 --> 19:43.834
about Gibbs' suspension.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.837
So <i>not</i> a love connection.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.449
Why would Gibbs come here?

19:49.492 --> 19:51.973
I say we find
this Marcie woman and ask her.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.844
Well, judging
by the mess in here,

19:53.888 --> 19:55.803
we're not the only ones
looking for her.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.895
And you expect me to believe

20:00.938 --> 20:02.592
you're a special agent?

20:02.636 --> 20:04.855
Suspended special agent.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.727
Yeah, I got that
part of your story.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.425
The part I don't get is,
why'd you say "no cops"?

20:09.469 --> 20:11.775
I'll bet it's because he
doesn't want that serial killer

20:11.819 --> 20:13.386
to know he's
still alive.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.736
That's a good bet.
My phone call. Now.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.346
That was only
if we believed you.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.695
And we don't.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.262
Serial killers,

20:20.306 --> 20:21.872
boat bombs.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.483
He's clearly
one of those bastards

20:23.526 --> 20:25.572
doing God knows what
at the North Shore.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.226
Hell, he probably knows
where Sandy is.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.445
Don't think we didn't notice
she's gone missing.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.186
I don't know what
you are talking about.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.274
You're wasting time.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.494
Shoot me!

20:34.537 --> 20:35.538
Or give me a telephone

20:35.582 --> 20:36.931
and let me call my friend

20:36.974 --> 20:37.975
and warn her!

20:38.019 --> 20:39.716
Y-You mean the reporter?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.283
Marcie Warren.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.067
Her life's in danger.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.512
Hello?

20:52.555 --> 20:54.253
Anybody home?

20:54.296 --> 20:56.646
Adams County
Sheriff's Department.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.736
Well, just what the hell
are police doing here?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.172
That's not a real cop.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.174
Come again?

21:03.218 --> 21:06.308
A cop would know the star goes
on his left side of his shirt.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.528
That's not a real cop.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.878
How the hell do I know
you're telling the truth?

21:10.921 --> 21:13.837
Well, ask him a
"real cop" question.

21:13.881 --> 21:16.100
N-Now, hon,
you can't go out there now.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.451
If Gibbs is right,
that guy could be dangerous.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.496
I can take care of myself.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.716
All right.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.892
You just take care of him.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.809
- Can I help you, deputy?
Sure, ma'am.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.724
Heard about that boat exploding?

21:30.767 --> 21:32.900
You know,
I'm generally a pacifist,

21:32.943 --> 21:35.511
but if anything happens
to my Thelmy,

21:35.555 --> 21:37.557
I'm gonna shoot you first.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.211
What do you see?

21:40.255 --> 21:41.604
She's talking.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.127
Still?

21:43.171 --> 21:44.868
How is she?

21:44.912 --> 21:47.001
Gibbs?
Answer me.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.397
Well?

21:51.440 --> 21:53.224
What did he say?

21:53.268 --> 21:55.052
He asked what we knew
about the explosion.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.619
And he gave me
the wrong answer

21:56.663 --> 21:58.012
about Sergeant Watson.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.493
Uh, the old cop
who ran the stables?

22:00.536 --> 22:02.146
He's been dead
for ten years.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.365
Exactly.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.542
But Deputy Dawg out there
didn't know that.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.460
You were right.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.116
What else is he right about?

22:19.120 --> 22:22.384
Got it. Thanks.
BOLO's out on Marcie Warren,

22:22.428 --> 22:23.951
and cyber unit's starting
a trace on her phone.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.169
No need.

22:25.213 --> 22:26.432
I understand you
can't divulge

22:26.475 --> 22:28.564
information about Gibbs.

22:28.608 --> 22:31.219
Can you at least tell me
has a body been recovered?

22:31.262 --> 22:32.568
Ms. Warren?

22:33.613 --> 22:34.918
Agent McGee?

22:34.962 --> 22:36.398
Yeah.
Oh.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.791
I saw the news.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.749
Is there any word on Gibbs?

22:39.793 --> 22:40.881
Hey, wh-what's
going on?

22:40.924 --> 22:42.361
We're hoping
that you can tell us.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.363
Oh. So sorry.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.062
Hello?

22:49.455 --> 22:51.457
Oh, thank God. Gibbs!

22:54.416 --> 22:56.244
Oh, I'm at NCIS.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.767
Of course.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.465
- He wants to talk to you.
- Oh.

22:59.508 --> 23:00.683
Boss?

23:00.727 --> 23:01.684
Yeah, McGee.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.816
Boss, where are you?

23:02.859 --> 23:04.470
You keep Marcie safe.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.081
Full protective detail, 24/7.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.605
Yeah, you got it.
But what is this all about?

23:10.954 --> 23:13.174
Boss?

23:14.654 --> 23:15.829
What happened?

23:15.872 --> 23:16.917
What did he say?

23:16.960 --> 23:19.398
He hung up on me.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.714
- Torres.
- Yo.

23:31.758 --> 23:34.151
I know I'm new,
and I've never met the man,

23:34.195 --> 23:35.718
but is this normal?

23:35.762 --> 23:37.285
Is what normal?

23:37.328 --> 23:40.201
Does Gibbs usually hang up
on his team after almost dying?

23:40.244 --> 23:42.464
Well, he's a man
of few words.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.510
Sure.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.425
I just thought that
maybe some of those words

23:46.468 --> 23:48.035
would be used
to say where he is

23:48.078 --> 23:50.211
or who planted a bomb
on his boat.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.431
I mean, he didn't sound hurt
or under duress,

23:52.474 --> 23:53.823
so why not take
a moment to chat?

23:53.867 --> 23:55.825
Well, Gibbs always
has a reason.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.827
He stone-cold dissed McGee.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.743
Look, the man
spent seven years

24:00.787 --> 24:02.789
building a boat in his basement

24:02.832 --> 24:05.400
just to have it blown
into tiny bits.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.185
My guess is he's looking
for the guy who did it.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.057
That would mean Gibbs has
a lead.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.362
He always does.

24:11.406 --> 24:14.496
Yet another thing
he did not say on the phone.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.846
So what does Gibbs know
that we don't?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.718
That's what
I'm going to ask Marcie.

24:18.761 --> 24:21.155
You know, based on the
one thing he did say,

24:21.198 --> 24:22.983
it seems like
I was right.

24:23.026 --> 24:26.421
Those two are pretty close.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.205
Gibbs does not have
a girlfriend.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.512
- Think about it.
- I'd rather not.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.079
You never know.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.777
Solving this case
could depend on it.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.129
Here you go.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.522
These should fit.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.524
I guess we owe you an apology

24:42.568 --> 24:44.961
for this little
misunderstanding.

24:45.005 --> 24:49.313
You really think that fake cop
is some kind of serial killer?

24:49.357 --> 24:50.924
I'm gonna find out.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.100
You're going to the North Shore.

24:53.143 --> 24:54.710
Tell me about Sandy.

24:54.754 --> 24:55.842
Huh?

24:55.885 --> 24:57.191
You were talking about her.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.540
You said she went missing.

24:58.584 --> 25:02.501
Sandy delivers our groceries,
uh, every week.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.503
Nice, nice gal.

25:04.546 --> 25:08.550
But her boyfriend is
a real piece of work. Lonny.

25:08.594 --> 25:12.641
Sandy said he's been going up
to the North Shore a lot lately.

25:12.685 --> 25:13.860
Yeah, next thing you know

25:13.903 --> 25:15.296
she's coming here
covered with bruises.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.777
Sandy didn't show up
for her next two deliveries.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.082
We haven't heard
from her since.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.302
Nothing good going on
at the North Shore.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.564
Yeah, well,
that's where I'm going.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.435
Gibbs, that was

25:24.479 --> 25:26.481
one big-ass chunk of wood
in your side,

25:26.525 --> 25:28.265
and my eyesight is not
what it used to be.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.006
I might have missed
a sliver or two.

25:30.050 --> 25:33.575
Any sudden movement could cause
some serious internal bleeding.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.098
Gibbs.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.101
Lonny is, uh...

25:38.145 --> 25:41.148
he's too dumb to be your killer,
but, uh,

25:41.191 --> 25:43.237
if he's mixed up with this guy,

25:43.280 --> 25:44.760
you're gonna need this.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.899
It was an anniversary present.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.857
Number five is wood.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.642
- Mm-hmm.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.600
You need anything else?

25:59.645 --> 26:01.734
That run?

26:05.781 --> 26:09.132
They were killed
exactly 100 days apart.

26:09.176 --> 26:11.787
All three were bound
with red duct tape

26:11.831 --> 26:13.702
and bludgeoned to death
with a claw hammer.

26:13.746 --> 26:16.444
So you and Gibbs have been
hunting a serial killer.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.142
He never told you about us?

26:19.186 --> 26:20.796
It-it didn't come up.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.450
No. I mean...

26:22.493 --> 26:25.279
the two of you
are working together?

26:25.322 --> 26:28.108
Well, let's just say
I've learned more

26:28.151 --> 26:31.590
about his lack of table manners
than I ever cared to know.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.070
Not to mention
the holes in his socks.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.637
Gibbs took his boots off?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.030
Yes.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.510
I've never seen Gibbs
without his boots.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.251
I didn't even know
they came off.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.557
Oh.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.819
Oh,

26:43.863 --> 26:46.474
you two
are trying to decide

26:46.517 --> 26:49.085
if Gibbs and I
are getting it on, right?

26:51.044 --> 26:53.002
What is this, high school?

26:54.090 --> 26:57.703
Shouldn't we be more focused
on a serial killer?

26:57.746 --> 26:59.008
Yes, ma'am.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.358
You recognize this woman?

27:01.402 --> 27:02.751
Her body was pulled
from the lake

27:02.795 --> 27:04.187
where Gibbs' boat was
found-- there was

27:04.231 --> 27:05.624
red tape and hammer marks.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.538
This is Camila Salas.

27:07.582 --> 27:09.976
She disappeared two weeks ago.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.543
Last time
I talked to Gibbs,

27:12.587 --> 27:14.545
he was heading
to the North Shore

27:14.589 --> 27:16.243
to look for her body.

27:16.286 --> 27:18.637
Before someone blew up his boat.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.552
Probably the same person
that trashed your office.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.598
I haven't been there since Gibbs
found out it was bugged.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.686
Seems like
you were close

27:24.730 --> 27:26.775
- to catching this guy.
- No.

27:26.819 --> 27:30.474
Not really. I mean, everything
we have is right here.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.954
So no suspects, no leads?

27:31.998 --> 27:33.695
- Do you have any
idea where Gibbs

27:33.739 --> 27:34.740
might be headed now?

27:34.783 --> 27:36.176
No. I'm sorry.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.484
I've been looking into
our mystery lady in the lake.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.052
Marcie just helped us
ID her as Camila Salas.

27:43.096 --> 27:46.839
Ah, speaking of Marcie,
are she and Gibbs...?

27:46.882 --> 27:49.319
- It's hard to say.
- It's like a nature documentary.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.408
You know, I don't really care
about the mating habits

27:51.452 --> 27:53.193
of water buffalo, but I...

27:53.236 --> 27:54.803
just can't look away.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.326
Kasie, what do you got?

27:56.370 --> 27:57.588
Oh. Weather patterns.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.765
I used them to determine

27:59.808 --> 28:01.549
where Ms. Salas's body
was originally dumped.

28:01.592 --> 28:04.073
Freshwater lakes don't
have tides or currents.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.858
Right, but they do have wind
patterns and water temperatures

28:05.901 --> 28:07.337
that can affect drift.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.992
Working backwards from
where divers found the body,

28:10.036 --> 28:13.039
I was able to determine that it
was dropped into the water here.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.431
That's the North Shore.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.303
That's where Gibbs
was originally heading.

28:16.346 --> 28:19.045
The area is a natural preserve,

28:19.088 --> 28:21.177
uninhabited and undeveloped.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.352
What's this?

28:22.396 --> 28:24.006
Looks like

28:24.050 --> 28:25.573
an abandoned
ranger station.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.314
If it's abandoned,
what are these fresh ruts

28:27.357 --> 28:28.707
leading to it?

28:30.578 --> 28:32.188
Somebody's been going
there on the regular.

28:32.232 --> 28:33.668
Maybe to dump bodies.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.496
I don't know, but
if I wanted to find

28:35.539 --> 28:36.976
the killer who
blew up my boat,

28:37.019 --> 28:39.108
and I thought he was somewhere
on the North Shore...

28:39.152 --> 28:41.023
That's where
- you'd start looking.
- Yeah.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.808
There's just one problem.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.463
If Gibbs actually does find
this guy,

28:46.507 --> 28:47.987
what's he gonna do to him?

30:27.913 --> 30:29.131
Federal agents!

30:30.176 --> 30:31.786
Agent Knight, stand down!

30:31.830 --> 30:32.787
- Stand down!
- Knight, Knight...

30:33.919 --> 30:36.095
Oh. Agent Gibbs.

30:37.226 --> 30:39.576
Jess Knight.
Pleasure to meet you.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.102
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:45.539 --> 30:47.889
It's good to see you, too, boss.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.942
You're a hard man
to find.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.683
Well, maybe that's
the point, McGee.

30:59.727 --> 31:00.989
You okay?

31:01.033 --> 31:03.035
Yeah, I'm fine.
I told you I'm fine.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.167
Um, no, actually, you didn't
tell me you were fine.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.474
You hung up on me.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.650
Which is kind of odd,
considering that your boat

31:09.693 --> 31:12.305
- just blew up.
- Well, you see, that's it--
it's my boat, Tim.

31:12.348 --> 31:13.915
It's <i>my</i> problem.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.004
It's not your problem.

31:16.048 --> 31:17.919
Boss, are you serious right now?

31:19.573 --> 31:20.922
Gibbs,
someone tried to kill you,

31:20.966 --> 31:23.707
so not only is it my problem,
it's my job.

31:25.274 --> 31:26.928
Thought you'd be happy
to see the team.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.408
Not my team.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.673
Suspended. Remember?

31:32.716 --> 31:34.762
Coming to find you
is not about finding a badge,

31:34.805 --> 31:36.024
it's about family.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.156
Boss!

31:38.984 --> 31:40.724
Well, there's a lot
of cans here.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.813
But who put them there?

31:42.857 --> 31:45.555
Doomsday prepper? Pyromaniac?

31:48.863 --> 31:50.212
Mmm.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.997
That's sweet.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.392
Smells like regular unleaded.

31:56.436 --> 31:58.525
You a gasoline sommelier?

31:58.568 --> 32:01.528
No, just a guy who went
undercover with a drug cartel.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.851
Meth?

32:21.896 --> 32:23.419
It was hidden in the gasoline.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.944
Well, that explains the, uh,
the stockpile.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.077
So is your serial
killer also a...

32:29.121 --> 32:30.426
a drug dealer?

32:32.298 --> 32:34.169
I think we're
about to find out.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.389
We got companycoming.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.703
We're pinned down.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.227
We're gonna need
a distraction.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.055
Agent Knight.

32:50.098 --> 32:51.926
How do you feel
about sexist stereotypes?

32:51.970 --> 32:53.319
I have thoughts.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.364
Boss?

32:57.584 --> 32:59.020
Boss, you okay?

32:59.064 --> 33:01.414
Where do you want me?

33:03.894 --> 33:05.418
Damn it, Lonny,

33:05.461 --> 33:07.724
who else did your girl tell
about this place?

33:07.768 --> 33:10.205
Nobody. I promise.

33:12.512 --> 33:14.905
Sandy, I swear
your big mouth

33:14.949 --> 33:15.994
is gonna get me killed.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.605
- Please just let me go.
- Shut up.

33:18.648 --> 33:19.998
Stay in the
damn car.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.043
Lonny, focus.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.479
Everyone stay here.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.481
No one shoots
until I do.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.661
You in the cabin!

33:33.141 --> 33:34.708
Come on out.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.497
I can explain, Sheriff.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.543
See, the gauge said that

33:43.586 --> 33:45.327
I only had a
quarter tank left.

33:45.371 --> 33:49.070
How lucky was I that I just
coasted into this place?

33:49.114 --> 33:51.029
♪Blessed.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.205
Put the can down.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.033
I only need enough
to get to Essex.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.338
I can pay you back.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.384
Put it down.

33:58.427 --> 33:59.907
Or not. It's...

34:01.387 --> 34:03.693
I can see that you
take petty theft

34:03.737 --> 34:06.261
very seriously around here.

34:06.305 --> 34:08.655
Just who the hell are you?

34:08.698 --> 34:10.526
NCIS.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.093
Do not move.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.056
Wouldn't do that.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.448
Drop your weapons.

34:21.450 --> 34:22.669
Why?

34:23.844 --> 34:25.411
We got you
outnumbered.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.543
Not if you count our sniper.

34:38.032 --> 34:40.034
Don't shoot! I give up!

34:40.078 --> 34:41.166
Hands on your head.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.341
Out of the vehicle.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.745
I-I'm not with him. I swear.

35:01.621 --> 35:04.145
Our fake deputy's name
is Randall Sledge.

35:04.189 --> 35:06.452
He's got a long history
of drug trafficking.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.238
I'm not taking
any stupid deals.

35:12.284 --> 35:13.850
You say that now.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.070
Recognize any
of these people?

35:19.160 --> 35:20.466
Nope.

35:20.509 --> 35:23.033
That's a pretty breezy
reaction to murder.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.166
'Cause I didn't kill anybody.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.386
So why were you impersonating
an officer

35:27.429 --> 35:28.909
and trying to kill Gibbs?

35:28.952 --> 35:29.953
Who?

35:34.262 --> 35:36.090
Our boss.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.092
I didn't do that, either.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.094
Bummer for him, though.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.227
I have never seen someone
so casual

35:42.270 --> 35:45.534
when facing five life sentences.

35:45.578 --> 35:49.016
Judges don't go easy on...
cop killers.

35:52.280 --> 35:56.371
Hey, my brother's a cop, and I
stole one of his uniforms, okay?

35:58.112 --> 36:00.201
After the boat explosion, the
lake was swarming with police.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.550
I just needed to find out

36:01.594 --> 36:03.683
if that old couple
blabbed about...

36:03.726 --> 36:07.121
my business on the North Shore.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.905
That's it.

36:12.213 --> 36:15.042
Take my fingerprints and DNA.
I'm no killer.

36:15.085 --> 36:17.566
And if that bitch Sandy said
I was, don't listen to her.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.133
The tongue is the sword
of a woman.

36:22.963 --> 36:23.920
Sorry.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.183
Well, it seems
Agent Knight

36:25.226 --> 36:26.836
is fitting in
quite well.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.274
A wise choice.

36:29.317 --> 36:32.102
You were gonna assign
Agent Knight the whole time.

36:32.146 --> 36:34.279
That probie was just for show.

36:34.322 --> 36:36.411
Well, sometimes it's better
when it's all your idea.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.110
For what it's worth, I think
our phony cop in there

36:40.154 --> 36:41.634
is telling the truth.

36:41.677 --> 36:44.985
Which means we still have
a serial killer to catch.

36:45.028 --> 36:47.422
Director.
Yeah?

36:47.466 --> 36:49.946
Will Gibbs be involved
with the case?

36:49.990 --> 36:52.122
That's entirely up to him.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.716
You can stay.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.153
I didn't mean to interrupt.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.851
Just wanted to come up here

37:24.894 --> 37:26.592
good work today.

37:26.635 --> 37:27.984
Yeah, you, too.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.685
Is he okay?

37:32.728 --> 37:34.382
Tim, you okay?

37:34.426 --> 37:36.732
Rule 91.

37:38.473 --> 37:40.083
Should I know
what that means?

37:40.127 --> 37:41.563
No one knows what it means.

37:41.607 --> 37:44.305
I know what it means.

37:44.349 --> 37:47.003
I looked in my old notes.

37:47.047 --> 37:50.093
- He takes notes.

37:50.137 --> 37:53.967
"When you decide to walk away...

37:54.010 --> 37:56.012
never look back."

37:57.405 --> 37:59.494
Sounds pretty,

37:59.538 --> 38:00.669
but...

38:00.713 --> 38:02.671
why put it on a boat?

38:02.715 --> 38:05.979
Because I don't think Gibbs
is coming back.

38:06.022 --> 38:08.416
Back to NCIS?

38:08.460 --> 38:10.505
Back to anything.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.466
At least not until he finds
this serial killer.

38:15.510 --> 38:17.425
On his own.

38:17.469 --> 38:20.994
Wasn't that how he got his boat
blown up in the first place?

38:22.300 --> 38:23.736
Sorry.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.215
Too soon?

38:26.434 --> 38:28.044
Yes.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.659
You're not wrong, though.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.619
Gibbs is gonna
get himself killed.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.318
Right.

38:40.361 --> 38:43.277
Which one of you
is gonna stop him?

38:48.151 --> 38:49.370
All right.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.024
It's looking
pretty good.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.593
Looks like you did
some shooting.

38:55.855 --> 38:58.379
At Lonny, I hope.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.251
- I didn't hit him.
- Aw, that's too bad.

39:01.295 --> 39:02.862
Well, thanks for trying.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.038
And, uh, for
taking out

39:05.081 --> 39:07.214
the entire North
Shore gang.

39:07.257 --> 39:11.349
Although I know that wasn't
exactly what you were going for.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.222
Maybe you need to keep this.

39:15.265 --> 39:16.571
Uh, no, thank you.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.312
- Well, if you ever
do need a favor,

39:18.356 --> 39:19.879
- we got your back.
- You, too.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.794
Just take care
of each other, okay?

39:21.837 --> 39:23.578
Well, we been doing that
for years.

39:23.622 --> 39:25.450
That's what family's for.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.758
Evening.

39:31.194 --> 39:32.195
Sorry to interrupt.

39:33.849 --> 39:34.981
Can we talk?

39:36.025 --> 39:39.594
Uh, we'll catch up
before you leave, Gibbs.

39:48.864 --> 39:51.737
Whatever you got to say, McGee,

39:51.780 --> 39:53.565
say it.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.262
Rule 91 sucks.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.874
That it?

39:58.918 --> 40:00.267
No.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.661
Rule 91 sucks because it is
in direct violation

40:02.704 --> 40:06.186
"Never screw over your partner."

40:06.229 --> 40:08.057
I'm not your partner.

40:08.101 --> 40:10.320
You see a badge?

40:10.364 --> 40:12.366
The team is your partner.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.325
And you not being a part of it
is screwing us over.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.719
You don't need me.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.329
You're right.

40:19.373 --> 40:22.289
While you were on suspension,
we did our job.

40:22.332 --> 40:24.291
We made it work. We did it well.

40:24.334 --> 40:26.989
But you know what?
We are better together.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.905
McGee... Boss,

40:29.949 --> 40:32.255
you know I'm right.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.257
You have to.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.216
You built us.

40:36.259 --> 40:38.697
And we got a serial
killer to catch.

40:38.740 --> 40:42.048
But in order to do that,
we need to be a team.

40:42.091 --> 40:45.094
We need to be your team.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.971
Say something.

40:59.935 --> 41:02.068
I'm proud of you.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.940
What?

41:06.420 --> 41:08.466
Keep pushing, McGee.

41:10.032 --> 41:12.339
You always keep pushing.

41:12.382 --> 41:14.907
Does that mean you're in?

41:20.260 --> 41:22.871
What do you got?
