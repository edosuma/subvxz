WEBVTT

00:09.635 --> 00:12.095
Okay...

00:13.806 --> 00:17.643
Boron... Okay.

00:13.806 --> 00:17.643
Atomic number five.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.603
Category, metalloid.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.105
Doesn't your grandfather

00:19.645 --> 00:22.105
have metalloids?

00:22.147 --> 00:24.566
Yeah, can't sit down.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.196
Canadium.

00:30.155 --> 00:34.075
A person from Canada...

00:30.155 --> 00:34.075
Mium.

00:35.243 --> 00:39.247
Personality...

00:35.243 --> 00:39.247
Canadian-ish.

00:40.749 --> 00:45.420
It's cadmium. Atomic number 48.

00:40.749 --> 00:45.420
Category, transition metal.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.924
Ooh, and once again

00:45.462 --> 00:48.924
Charlotte gets the answer right.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.886
Shocker.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.886
Didn't see that coming.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.054
Yeah...

00:54.763 --> 00:56.932
Too bad I don't know the atomic

00:54.763 --> 00:56.932
number for idiot boys.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.392
(boys)

00:56.974 --> 00:58.392
Oh!

00:59.727 --> 01:01.395
Good for you, Charlotte.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.691
So, hey, what are we

01:02.980 --> 01:05.691
all doing Saturday night?

01:09.028 --> 01:10.905
You guys want to

01:09.028 --> 01:10.905
play miniature golf?

01:11.530 --> 01:12.698
(all)

01:11.530 --> 01:12.698
No.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.701
You want to play enormous golf?

01:17.912 --> 01:19.538
Hello?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.248
He's gonna find out.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.083
Well, I'm not telling him.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.083
What?

01:25.084 --> 01:26.795
Come on, no secrets.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.296
Flashback?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.715
Why are you asking me?

01:30.173 --> 01:32.801
This is the first time I've even

01:30.173 --> 01:32.801
been invited to your house.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.765
Ugh, all right.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.684
Henry...

01:41.100 --> 01:43.270
We are all going to

01:41.100 --> 01:43.270
Debbie Putch's birthday party.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.360
But...

01:47.441 --> 01:50.360
I didn't get an invitation.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.154
Is that a big surprise?

01:53.989 --> 01:55.282
You know why.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.829
Henry...

01:58.911 --> 02:00.829
It's not fair.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.707
You almost killed her.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.126
No I didn't.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.126
(doorbell rings)

02:06.501 --> 02:07.168
Who's here?

02:07.210 --> 02:08.045
Our food.

02:11.006 --> 02:11.924
Sushi Dushi.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.384
Here's my mom's credit card.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.430
Don't be mad.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.430
I am mad.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.557
Well, you can't

02:18.472 --> 02:20.557
blame Debbie.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.684
I blame Debbie,

02:20.599 --> 02:22.684
I blame her parents,

02:22.726 --> 02:25.062
and I blame anyone else

02:22.726 --> 02:25.062
who thinks it was my fault.

02:25.104 --> 02:26.605
Hey.

02:25.104 --> 02:26.605
Yeah?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.189
What are you

02:26.647 --> 02:28.189
so ticked off about?

02:29.858 --> 02:31.026
Why do you want to know?

02:31.068 --> 02:33.194
Hey, man, just because

02:31.068 --> 02:33.194
I deliver Sushi

02:33.236 --> 02:35.322
doesn't mean

02:33.236 --> 02:35.322
I don't have curiosities.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.159
Tell him

02:37.616 --> 02:39.159
what happened.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.159
No.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.829
I've already told the story,

02:39.200 --> 02:41.829
like, a thousand times.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.456
Flashback?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.456
What?

02:45.206 --> 02:47.584
Tell the guy how Henry

02:45.206 --> 02:47.584
almost killed Debbie.

02:48.794 --> 02:53.757
All right. It all went down

02:48.794 --> 02:53.757
at Debbie's last birthday party.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.678
And it almost was her last.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.678
Ooh, tell me more.

02:59.513 --> 03:04.143
Okay. Try to visualize this.

02:59.513 --> 03:04.143
Debbie was turning 13 years old,

03:04.852 --> 03:07.896
and she was getting everything

03:04.852 --> 03:07.896
all ready for her party

03:08.480 --> 03:10.983
way up on the roof

03:08.480 --> 03:10.983
of her parents' condo.

03:13.527 --> 03:17.196
(Flashback)

03:13.527 --> 03:17.196
It looked like it was going to

03:13.527 --> 03:17.196
be the best birthday party ever.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.992
Mom, this is going to be

03:17.238 --> 03:19.992
the best birthday party ever.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.328
It will be if we get

03:21.200 --> 03:23.328
everything ready.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.790
Excuse me, I'd like to get

03:24.203 --> 03:26.790
some pics of the kids

03:26.832 --> 03:28.667
helping me set up.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.667
Will do.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.795
Okay. All the balloons

03:29.668 --> 03:31.795
have been blown up.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.048
What else can we do?

03:31.837 --> 03:34.048
Let's see.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.050
Ooh, why don't you and the boys

03:34.089 --> 03:36.050
check out the ball machine

03:36.091 --> 03:38.010
and make sure

03:36.091 --> 03:38.010
it works.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.010
Sure.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.762
Guys, let's make sure

03:38.052 --> 03:40.762
this ball thing works.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.472
Okie dokie. Let's do it.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.472
(Oliver)

03:40.804 --> 03:42.472
All right.

03:47.811 --> 03:48.854
I'm ready.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.025
Set the ball speed

03:50.981 --> 03:53.025
nice and slow.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.609
Level two.

03:54.902 --> 03:55.903
Level two.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.873
Anyone see where it went?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.917
(crashing, glass breaking,

04:07.915 --> 04:09.917
tires screeching)

04:09.958 --> 04:12.086
(horn honking)

04:09.958 --> 04:12.086
You hit that Prius.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.671
(crashing)

04:12.127 --> 04:14.671
Which hit another Prius.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.719
Hey, guys.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.719
Sorry I'm late.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.846
I want to go

04:20.761 --> 04:22.846
to the pear store.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.806
Later. This is

04:22.888 --> 04:24.806
my little sister, Piper.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.892
Oh, hi, Piper.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.892
Ugh.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.188
Sorry I brought her,

04:28.435 --> 04:31.188
but I had to babysit tonight.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.856
Like I want to be here?

04:34.066 --> 04:37.903
Aw, Piper,

04:34.066 --> 04:37.903
I'm sure you'll have a--

04:34.066 --> 04:37.903
look at my phone!

04:37.945 --> 04:40.906
The screen's broken.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.906
No kidding, girl.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.201
Hey, Debbie,

04:42.490 --> 04:44.201
want to come hit a ball?

04:44.243 --> 04:45.994
Yeah I do.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.994
(mockingly)

04:44.243 --> 04:45.994
Yeah I do.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.707
Charlotte, would you come

04:47.996 --> 04:50.707
help me with the gift bags?

04:50.749 --> 04:52.626
Sure.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.253
Henry, go work

04:52.667 --> 04:54.253
the ball machine.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.504
Okay, I'm just going

04:54.294 --> 04:56.504
to go grab a chip.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.550
Look, I can't read

04:57.589 --> 05:00.550
my stupid screen!

05:01.384 --> 05:04.596
Okay, get ready,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.596
birthday girl.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.140
'Kay, 'Kay.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.599
Do it, Henry!

05:07.641 --> 05:09.143
All right,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.143
here it comes!

05:09.726 --> 05:12.729
(Flashback)

05:09.726 --> 05:12.729
And that's when things

05:09.726 --> 05:12.729
went real bad for Debbie.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.982
(screaming)

05:16.566 --> 05:17.859
Debbie!

05:20.612 --> 05:23.115
(groaning)

05:24.199 --> 05:26.326
Stop taking pictures

05:24.199 --> 05:26.326
and call 9-1-1!

05:26.367 --> 05:27.494
Oh, right.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.043
How did this happen?

05:36.377 --> 05:38.964
Henry made the ball go,

05:36.377 --> 05:38.964
like, 90 miles an hour.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.757
Wha... me?

05:41.300 --> 05:44.594
Henry, you set

05:41.300 --> 05:44.594
the ball speed to 11.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.055
No I didn't.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.515
Henry, why would you

05:47.097 --> 05:48.515
do that?

05:50.142 --> 05:52.269
Charlotte?

05:50.142 --> 05:52.269
I set it to two.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.271
And you were the only one

05:52.311 --> 05:54.271
standing near the machine.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.981
But I...

05:54.313 --> 05:55.981
Security!

05:56.023 --> 05:58.192
I didn't do anything.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.068
I never touched that machine.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.068
I swear. I didn't do it.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.530
(Flashback)

06:00.110 --> 06:03.530
And then ol' Henry

06:00.110 --> 06:03.530
got kicked out of the party

06:03.571 --> 06:05.157
before it ever got started.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.037
'Cause Henry's the one

06:06.616 --> 06:10.037
who set the ball machine to 11.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.206
Amen.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.875
It wasn't me.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.875
He says it was you.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.253
Are you supposed to be

06:16.459 --> 06:18.253
eating our Sushi?

06:19.338 --> 06:21.256
No, I'm not

06:19.338 --> 06:21.256
supposed to be.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.259
Henry, you might feel better

06:24.301 --> 06:26.094
if you just admit

06:24.301 --> 06:26.094
that you did it.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.684
You guys see the rage

06:31.016 --> 06:32.684
in this kid?

06:34.435 --> 06:37.314
Where I come from,

06:34.435 --> 06:37.314
a man who knocks a pretty girl

06:37.356 --> 06:40.108
off a roof on her birthday,

06:37.356 --> 06:40.108
he is no man.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.364
Will you tell these guys that

06:42.443 --> 06:45.364
I didn't set the machine to 11?

06:45.404 --> 06:46.240
I can't.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.240
Why not?

06:46.365 --> 06:47.074
'Cause you did it.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.957
It all just kind of happened.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.792
My dad was

06:55.999 --> 06:57.792
an irresponsible scientist.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.254
I wanted an afterschool job.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.923
And by accident,

07:00.295 --> 07:02.923
he made me indestructible.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.174
(screaming)

07:04.216 --> 07:06.218
(Henry)

07:04.216 --> 07:06.218
I went into this crazy store

07:06.718 --> 07:08.262
and met a pretty

07:06.718 --> 07:08.262
interesting guy.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.930
I'm going to blow your mind.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.682
Now I protect the good

07:09.971 --> 07:12.682
citizens of Swellview.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.684
Who call me...

07:12.724 --> 07:14.684
He turned out to be...

07:14.726 --> 07:16.395
(Ray)

07:14.726 --> 07:16.395
You know the name.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.395
Captain Man.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.188
That's right, Henry.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.565
In time, I realized

07:18.230 --> 07:20.565
that being a superhero

07:20.607 --> 07:23.318
is a lot to handle alone.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.318
He wanted some help.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.819
(Ray)

07:23.360 --> 07:24.819
I needed a sidekick.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.238
I, Henry hart...

07:26.280 --> 07:27.864
(Ray)

07:26.280 --> 07:27.864
Pledge to never ever,

07:26.280 --> 07:27.864
ever tell anyone...

07:27.906 --> 07:29.699
That I'm Captain Man's

07:27.906 --> 07:29.699
secret sidekick.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.159
It is done.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.535
(Henry)

07:31.201 --> 07:32.535
Now we blow bubbles.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.535
(Ray)

07:31.201 --> 07:32.535
And fight crime.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.121
(Henry)

07:33.120 --> 07:34.121
Feels good.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.845
Call it.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.845
Up the tube!

07:51.846 --> 07:53.181
Oh, my boot.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.391
(Ray screams)

08:06.611 --> 08:07.446
Hey.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.905
You called me?

08:08.947 --> 08:10.949
Yeah, check out

08:08.947 --> 08:10.949
what's in that bin.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.200
Okay.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.497
What is...

08:15.495 --> 08:17.497
I want you to do my laundry.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.165
Ew, no.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.875
(beeping)

08:20.917 --> 08:22.585
What does that sound mean?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.585
That we have a delivery.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.468
Huh.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.386
Did you order a pizza?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.386
No.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.685
Hey, get this.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.685
"Dear Captain Man,

08:38.726 --> 08:40.603
our daughter Debbie

08:38.726 --> 08:40.603
is having her birthday party

08:40.645 --> 08:41.980
Saturday night."

08:40.645 --> 08:41.980
Oh no, Debbie?

08:42.897 --> 08:44.649
Shh.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.775
"We're inviting some of Debbie's

08:44.691 --> 08:45.775
favorite celebrities,

08:45.817 --> 08:47.486
including you

08:45.817 --> 08:47.486
and Miss Swellview."

08:47.527 --> 08:49.112
Oh, she is so hot.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.531
Will you please stop

08:50.030 --> 08:51.531
reading the box?

08:51.572 --> 08:52.199
No.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.701
"So, if you'll agree

08:53.200 --> 08:54.701
to come to Debbie's party,

08:54.742 --> 08:58.663
you may cash the enclosed

08:54.742 --> 08:58.663
check for $12,000."

08:58.705 --> 09:00.248
Whoa, look at

08:58.705 --> 09:00.248
this check.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.791
It has pizza grease on it.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.253
I know.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.253
Fine.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.507
Go to her party with every

09:05.295 --> 09:08.507
other kid in my class except me.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.091
Why aren't you invited?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.344
'Cause I was at Debbie's

09:10.133 --> 09:12.344
birthday party last year

09:12.386 --> 09:15.013
and everyone thinks I shot her

09:12.386 --> 09:15.013
in the face with a rubber ball

09:15.055 --> 09:16.597
and knocked her

09:15.055 --> 09:16.597
off the roof.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.058
Onto a dog.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.436
Oh yeah, I remember hearing

09:19.476 --> 09:21.436
about that on the news.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.937
You did that?

09:21.478 --> 09:22.937
No.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.481
Everyone just thinks

09:22.979 --> 09:24.481
it was me.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.317
Henry...

09:25.232 --> 09:27.317
It's just you and me here.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.403
So?

09:29.444 --> 09:31.446
Why did you

09:29.444 --> 09:31.446
shoot Debbie in the face?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.115
I didn't. Man, even you

09:31.571 --> 09:34.115
don't believe me.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.701
Do you want me

09:34.908 --> 09:36.701
to believe you?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.701
Yeah.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.412
Can I feel your head

09:36.743 --> 09:38.412
with my truth fingers?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.497
Sure you c--

09:38.453 --> 09:40.497
feel my what with your what?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.127
Is this

09:44.292 --> 09:46.127
gonna be weird?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.127
No.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.004
Okay.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.342
Now, I'm going to rub

09:50.340 --> 09:52.342
my finger nodules

09:52.384 --> 09:53.968
all over your head and face.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.347
So, what would be

09:55.053 --> 09:57.347
weird to you?

09:57.389 --> 09:58.765
(chuckles)

10:00.392 --> 10:02.852
See, these blinky things

10:00.392 --> 10:02.852
read human brainwaves

10:02.894 --> 10:05.480
like a lie detector

10:02.894 --> 10:05.480
but way more sophisticated.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.940
Whatever, just do it.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.234
All right, now...

10:13.154 --> 10:15.782
Think about Debbie's

10:13.154 --> 10:15.782
birthday party.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.453
Debbie's birthday party.

10:19.494 --> 10:24.291
One year ago.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.960
When a ball

10:24.332 --> 10:26.960
knocked her off the roof.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.796
Off the roof.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.175
Because you changed

10:30.547 --> 10:34.175
the ball speed from 2 to 11.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.387
No I did not.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.348
Why do you tell lies?

10:40.390 --> 10:42.392
I don't tell lies.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.728
Do you feel pretty

10:42.434 --> 10:45.728
when you tell lies?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.856
You said this

10:46.521 --> 10:48.856
wouldn't get weird.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.366
I believe you.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.451
Really?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.451
Yeah.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.328
But that doesn't mean

10:59.826 --> 11:01.328
everyone will.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.246
So you felt my face

11:01.369 --> 11:03.246
for nothing.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.207
No. Now we're going to

11:04.038 --> 11:06.207
find out the truth.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.667
But you already know

11:06.249 --> 11:07.667
I didn't do it.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.252
Yeah, but to know

11:07.708 --> 11:09.252
the full truth

11:09.294 --> 11:10.962
we've got to find out

11:09.294 --> 11:10.962
who did do it.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.422
That's the key slice

11:11.004 --> 11:12.422
of truth

11:12.464 --> 11:14.299
we need to complete

11:12.464 --> 11:14.299
the entire truth pie.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.759
Ooh, can we get

11:14.924 --> 11:16.759
some actual pie?

11:16.801 --> 11:18.595
I like the way

11:16.801 --> 11:18.595
you think about pie.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.264
So, how do we find out

11:21.306 --> 11:23.308
who really did change

11:21.306 --> 11:23.308
the ball speed from 2 to 11?

11:23.350 --> 11:26.311
Easy. We're going to dress up

11:23.350 --> 11:26.311
like foreign filmmakers

11:26.353 --> 11:27.854
and interview everyone

11:26.353 --> 11:27.854
who was on that roof

11:27.895 --> 11:30.315
when Debbie's face

11:27.895 --> 11:30.315
got smacked by the ball.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.652
And then we eat pie.

11:40.992 --> 11:44.829
(with German accent)

11:40.992 --> 11:44.829
And where were you when Debbie

11:40.992 --> 11:44.829
flew off the roof-us?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.623
(with German accent)

11:44.871 --> 11:46.623
- Yah, where were you?

11:47.290 --> 11:50.835
Where?

11:47.290 --> 11:50.835
I know it's you, guys.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.547
What guys?

11:51.002 --> 11:53.547
We are German filmmakers.

11:53.588 --> 11:57.175
Yah, we German.

11:53.588 --> 11:57.175
We like to eat

11:53.588 --> 11:57.175
weiner schnitzel.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.718
We also like

11:57.217 --> 11:59.718
to say weiner schnitzel.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.346
Weiner schnitzel.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.346
Yah, weiner schnitzel.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.560
I know you're Henry and Ray.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.560
PS, your accents are terrible.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.437
(without accent)

12:07.894 --> 12:09.437
Will you just answer

12:07.894 --> 12:09.437
our questions?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.064
(without accent)

12:09.479 --> 12:11.064
- We got a lot of these

12:09.479 --> 12:11.064
interviews to do.

12:12.190 --> 12:12.815
Go ahead.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.487
(with accent)

12:14.108 --> 12:17.487
- Okay. Where were you when

12:14.108 --> 12:17.487
Debbie flew off the roof-us?

12:17.820 --> 12:20.073
Well, Henry and Ray...

12:21.157 --> 12:23.076
I was helping Debbie's mom

12:21.157 --> 12:23.076
make gift bags.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.911
I was nowhere near

12:23.117 --> 12:24.911
the ball machine.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.539
(with accent)

12:25.579 --> 12:27.539
Do you think

12:25.579 --> 12:27.539
we can believe her?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.917
Dude, it's just us here.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.917
You can drop the accent.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.794
(no accent)

12:30.958 --> 12:33.794
Geez, man, why you always

12:30.958 --> 12:33.794
got to pee in my skeezits?

12:34.337 --> 12:35.672
I'm trying to prove

12:34.337 --> 12:35.672
I'm innocent.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.675
All right. Play the section

12:35.714 --> 12:38.675
from video four again.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.679
Video four.

12:42.721 --> 12:45.890
(Ray, with accent)

12:42.721 --> 12:45.890
Where were you last year when

12:42.721 --> 12:45.890
Debbie was knocked off the roof?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.851
(Henry, with accent)

12:46.558 --> 12:48.851
Yah, where were you?

12:48.893 --> 12:50.562
(Ray)

12:48.893 --> 12:50.562
Where?

12:50.604 --> 12:51.688
I was on the roof.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.524
(Ray)

12:52.564 --> 12:54.524
Achtung!

12:52.564 --> 12:54.524
(Henry)

12:52.564 --> 12:54.524
Gesundheit!

12:56.109 --> 12:56.735
Video three.

12:58.612 --> 13:03.032
Yeah, I've always liked Debbie.

12:58.612 --> 13:03.032
Except one time in fourth grade,

13:03.782 --> 13:07.120
she told the teacher on me

13:03.782 --> 13:07.120
and Sidney for eating bugs.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.707
That made me feel hatred.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.256
Okay, first,

13:15.420 --> 13:18.256
I only chewed the bugs.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.633
I did not swallow.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.137
And anyway, Henry's the one

13:20.925 --> 13:24.137
who changed the ball speed.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.138
No I didn't.

13:26.222 --> 13:26.931
Video six.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.145
No, I didn't change

13:28.516 --> 13:32.145
the stupid ball speed!

13:33.688 --> 13:35.273
Get out of my face!

13:36.815 --> 13:40.236
Look, I felt really bad

13:36.815 --> 13:40.236
when Debbie fell off the roof.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.114
Even though she used to make fun

13:40.278 --> 13:43.114
of my bucket collection.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.742
I'm a bucketeer.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.370
Okay, I guess I felt

13:46.618 --> 13:49.370
a little bit jealous

13:49.412 --> 13:51.623
when Debbie won

13:49.412 --> 13:51.623
the spelling bee last year.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.126
But I'm over it.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.126
That should've been my trophy!

13:57.086 --> 13:59.880
(Ray, with accent)

13:57.086 --> 13:59.880
Is that why you changed

13:57.086 --> 13:59.880
the ball speed?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.759
I want to talk to a lawyer.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.594
Video 15.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.264
I... I know nothing

14:05.470 --> 14:08.264
about any of this.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.268
Could someone get

14:10.183 --> 14:12.268
my manager, please?

14:13.436 --> 14:15.355
I don't think these guys

14:13.436 --> 14:15.355
are even German.

14:17.231 --> 14:22.320
So I'm going to...

14:17.231 --> 14:22.320
I got to go buy some socks.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.031
Socks? Right now?

14:25.072 --> 14:27.074
Yeah. It's an emergency.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.243
But we still

14:27.992 --> 14:29.243
haven't figured out

14:29.285 --> 14:30.911
who made Debbie

14:29.285 --> 14:30.911
fly off the roof.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.372
But, hey, you still got

14:30.953 --> 14:32.372
that thumb drive

14:32.413 --> 14:34.081
with all the pics

14:32.413 --> 14:34.081
from the party.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.916
Check those for evidence.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.502
Are you going

14:35.958 --> 14:37.502
to Debbie's party?

14:37.627 --> 14:38.419
(balks)

14:38.961 --> 14:42.173
No. Check the pics.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.173
Okay.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.270
(popping)

15:02.902 --> 15:04.028
I knew it.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.530
I knew you were going

15:04.070 --> 15:05.530
to Debbie's party.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.657
Miss Swellview's

15:05.572 --> 15:07.657
going to be there.

15:07.699 --> 15:11.619
You better not go.

15:07.699 --> 15:11.619
Okay, I won't go.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.121
Good.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.121
Fine.

15:16.957 --> 15:17.958
(whispering)

15:16.957 --> 15:17.958
Up the tube.

15:20.127 --> 15:24.382
Hey, where I come from, a man

15:20.127 --> 15:24.382
who lies about socks is no man!

15:33.140 --> 15:35.518
(music playing, loud chatter)

15:46.780 --> 15:48.615
Excuse me, Captain Man?

15:48.656 --> 15:51.284
Yes, hello, citizens.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.284
We're Debbie's parents.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.495
And this is Debbie,

15:51.910 --> 15:54.495
our birthday girl.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.373
She's so excited

15:55.413 --> 15:57.373
that you're here.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.250
Well, it's great

15:57.415 --> 15:59.250
to meet you, Debbie,

15:59.292 --> 16:00.960
and your wealthy parents.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.046
Oh, don't you remember?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.046
You and I...

16:04.088 --> 16:06.173
We met a long time ago.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.509
We did?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.509
What?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.804
Yeah.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.804
Remember the Swellview rodeo?

16:10.845 --> 16:14.014
I was a waitress and after the

16:10.845 --> 16:14.014
rodeo you invited me back to--

16:14.056 --> 16:15.767
Oh yes.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.730
It's so great to see you again,

16:17.351 --> 16:20.730
here with your husband.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.409
Hey!

16:33.785 --> 16:36.370
Everyone. Over here.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.370
Hello?

16:39.457 --> 16:41.918
That's Henry Hart.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.918
Why is he here?

16:41.960 --> 16:44.712
What happened with you

16:41.960 --> 16:44.712
and Captain Man after the rodeo?

16:45.797 --> 16:47.590
Okay, I know everyone's

16:45.797 --> 16:47.590
freaked out to see me here

16:47.632 --> 16:49.383
because of what happened

16:47.632 --> 16:49.383
last year.

16:50.009 --> 16:54.347
Sing Wrecking Ball!

16:50.009 --> 16:54.347
No. I'm not here to sing.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.142
I'm here 'cause you all think

16:55.097 --> 16:58.142
I did something I didn't do.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.436
You were the only one

16:58.184 --> 17:00.436
standing by the ball machine!

17:00.478 --> 17:01.771
Yeah!

17:01.813 --> 17:04.565
Hey, Henry! You got to try

17:01.813 --> 17:04.565
some of these meatballs!

17:05.984 --> 17:07.485
Look, I get

17:05.984 --> 17:07.485
why you all thought

17:07.527 --> 17:09.654
I was the one

17:07.527 --> 17:09.654
who turned up the ball speed,

17:10.530 --> 17:13.950
but maybe it wasn't me.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.950
Maybe it was someone else.

17:15.326 --> 17:19.163
Like Charlotte.

17:15.326 --> 17:19.163
(crowd gasps)

17:19.205 --> 17:21.875
Who was always jealous

17:19.205 --> 17:21.875
ever since Debbie beat her

17:21.916 --> 17:24.002
in the Swellview

17:21.916 --> 17:24.002
spelling bee.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.046
Well, you all know that

17:24.043 --> 17:27.046
trophy should've been mine.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.758
Or it could've been Jasper.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.552
(crowd gasps)

17:32.593 --> 17:35.847
Who's never forgotten that

17:32.593 --> 17:35.847
Debbie used to mock his buckets.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.225
Never forget.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.103
Or maybe

17:40.309 --> 17:43.103
it could've been Piper.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.481
(crowd gasps)

17:43.646 --> 17:45.481
Hey!

17:45.523 --> 17:47.608
I didn't even want to come

17:45.523 --> 17:47.608
to this party last year.

17:48.526 --> 17:52.780
Or this year.

17:48.526 --> 17:52.780
What am I doing here?

17:52.822 --> 17:55.074
Or maybe it was

17:52.822 --> 17:55.074
Sidney or Oliver.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.659
(crowd gasps)

17:56.701 --> 17:58.578
They got detention

17:56.701 --> 17:58.578
after Debbie told our teacher

17:58.619 --> 18:00.329
that they were eating bugs.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.628
The point is, I know who really

18:03.750 --> 18:07.628
changed the ball speed

18:07.670 --> 18:09.171
and knocked Debbie

18:07.670 --> 18:09.171
off the roof.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.715
And I have proof.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.133
(murmuring)

18:13.175 --> 18:14.677
Then show us!

18:13.175 --> 18:14.677
I will.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.097
But first, I'm going

18:15.803 --> 18:18.097
to get myself a meatball.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.474
I'll be back

18:19.098 --> 18:20.474
after a short break.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.853
And then everybody's

18:21.225 --> 18:23.853
going to know the truth.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.689
Sing Call Me Maybe!

18:23.895 --> 18:26.689
I'm not singing!

18:33.571 --> 18:34.530
Okay.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.200
First I'd like to say...

18:35.406 --> 18:38.200
Great meatballs.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.331
And now the proof

18:41.537 --> 18:44.331
that one year ago today

18:44.373 --> 18:46.292
I was not the person

18:44.373 --> 18:46.292
responsible

18:46.333 --> 18:48.127
for Debbie

18:46.333 --> 18:48.127
being knocked off the roof.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.714
Using my phone, I will now show

18:48.836 --> 18:51.714
you actual photos

18:51.756 --> 18:54.133
taken just before

18:51.756 --> 18:54.133
Debbie's party last year.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.513
Pic one.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.266
Here you see Jasper wiping

18:59.555 --> 19:02.266
his sweaty hand on Charlotte.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.815
And to the left you see

19:04.978 --> 19:08.815
Sidney and Oliver eating bugs.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.483
No surprise there.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.360
I haven't eaten a bug

19:11.692 --> 19:13.360
since passover!

19:14.654 --> 19:17.573
I'm eating a bug right now.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.785
But look closer and...

19:21.619 --> 19:23.454
What's that we see

19:21.619 --> 19:23.454
in the background? Hmm?

19:25.123 --> 19:28.459
It's my little sister Piper

19:25.123 --> 19:28.459
upset about something as usual.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.799
Pic two. Here we have

19:30.670 --> 19:34.799
a clearer image of Piper.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.218
And as you can see, she's really

19:34.841 --> 19:38.218
mad about her broken phone.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.221
So she's throwing it.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.100
So what?

19:44.391 --> 19:46.310
I'm glad you asked.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.310
Pic three.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.858
Here you see me standing

19:48.270 --> 19:51.858
innocently by the ball machine.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.153
And when I zoom in...

19:56.570 --> 19:59.907
You see Piper's phone

19:56.570 --> 19:59.907
hitting the 11 button.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.368
(gasps and murmurs)

20:02.409 --> 20:03.161
(Jasper)

20:02.409 --> 20:03.161
Oh my God!

20:03.619 --> 20:05.371
Piper did it!

20:03.619 --> 20:05.371
Security!

20:07.456 --> 20:11.544
But... But...

20:07.456 --> 20:11.544
It wasn't my fault.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.963
I didn't know my phone

20:11.585 --> 20:13.963
would hit the button.

20:14.005 --> 20:20.427
I'm a victim! I'm a victim!

20:14.005 --> 20:20.427
I want to talk to a lawyer!

20:22.180 --> 20:23.723
So, miss Swellview...

20:23.764 --> 20:26.184
Since I assume

20:23.764 --> 20:26.184
there isn't a Mr. Swellview,

20:26.225 --> 20:28.186
I was wondering

20:26.225 --> 20:28.186
if you might want to...

20:31.731 --> 20:33.315
walk away.

20:42.700 --> 20:47.121
Henry, we are so sorry

20:42.700 --> 20:47.121
we blamed you.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.915
Especially me.

20:48.956 --> 20:52.376
Well, I'm sorry that my little

20:48.956 --> 20:52.376
sister almost killed you.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.545
Hey...

20:53.127 --> 20:54.545
Things happen.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.422
Yeah, that's true.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.422
They do, they do.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.466
Mom, I'm going to go

20:58.049 --> 20:59.466
jump on the trampoline

20:59.508 --> 21:00.634
right by the edge

20:59.508 --> 21:00.634
of the roof.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.511
Have fun, baby.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.890
Hey, Mrs. Putch?

21:03.387 --> 21:05.890
Yeah?

21:05.932 --> 21:08.434
A balloon got stuck up there

21:05.932 --> 21:08.434
by that light.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.061
Ooh yeah,

21:08.475 --> 21:10.061
that could start a fire.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.230
Yeah.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.230
Hey, no worries.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.731
I'll climb up there

21:12.271 --> 21:13.731
and get it.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.110
I don't know.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.110
That could be dangerous.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.905
Eh, this kid

21:17.985 --> 21:20.905
can handle danger.

21:22.281 --> 21:22.907
Hold my meatball.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.581
Yay. This is

21:28.204 --> 21:30.581
my best birthday ever.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.962
I fixed it!

21:34.043 --> 21:35.962
Thank you!

21:36.754 --> 21:38.547
Hey, Henry, jump down!

21:38.589 --> 21:39.339
Okay!

21:40.466 --> 21:42.051
(screaming)

21:43.177 --> 21:45.345
(everyone shouting)

21:49.475 --> 21:51.018
(groaning)

21:51.769 --> 21:53.020
Whiskers?

21:54.272 --> 21:55.731
(shouts continue)

21:55.773 --> 21:57.691
Whiskers? Are you okay?

21:58.776 --> 22:03.614
Whiskers?

21:58.776 --> 22:03.614
(Debbie)

21:58.776 --> 22:03.614
My name is not Whiskers.

22:32.935 --> 22:33.560
(oven bell dings)

22:33.936 --> 22:34.687
(man)

22:33.936 --> 22:34.687
Mmm...
