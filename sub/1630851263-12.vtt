Today is the day of the
Jump City Comic Book Con.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.978
I can't believe you guys
are getting this worked up
over a comic book convention.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.700
Is it not just a room
filled with the picture books?

00:48.744 --> 00:52.095
No, mama. Comic Book Con
ain't just about comics.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.967
It's a place where you can meet
comic book legends,

00:55.011 --> 00:56.230
attend interesting panels,

00:56.273 --> 00:58.058
buy toys that are so rare,

00:58.101 --> 01:00.408
you never want to take him
out of the package, yo.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.888
Oh, that sounds the amazing.

01:02.932 --> 01:05.456
I wish to attend
the convention of the comics.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.720
I'm glad to hear that Star,
because we're all going.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.853
Forget it.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.484
I am not wasting my weekend
with a bunch of smelly
comic book nerds.

01:13.508 --> 01:17.512
Okay, then I guess
you don't mind missing out
on this exclusive

01:17.555 --> 01:22.082
Pretty Pretty Pegasus
action figure, with
five points of articulation...

01:22.125 --> 01:23.779
Solid gold plastic.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.520
And real life
horsey sounds.

01:27.565 --> 01:30.394
Real life horsey sounds?
Fine, I'll go.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.224
Titans, go! To the
Jump City Comic Book Con.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.274
Ha-ha, we's here.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.797
This place is so dope.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.364
Now, where can I get
my hands on that

01:43.407 --> 01:45.235
Pretty Pretty
Pegasus exclusive?

01:45.279 --> 01:47.194
On the other side
of the convention floor.

01:48.934 --> 01:52.199
Quick, Marv, take my picture
with these fans.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.741
They're dressed just like
the Teen Titans.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.289
We are the Teen Titans.

01:55.332 --> 01:56.594
Isn't that cute, George?

01:56.638 --> 01:58.292
They think they're
the real Titans.

01:58.335 --> 02:01.904
Hold up.
You're Marv Wolfman
and George Perez.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.906
It's an honor to meet you guys.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.343
Yo, Marv and George,
will you sign my belly?

02:06.387 --> 02:08.302
Who are these guys?

02:08.345 --> 02:11.696
You don't know
who Marv Wolfman
and George Perez are?

02:11.740 --> 02:14.021
They're the comic book legends
that turned the Teen Titans

02:14.046 --> 02:16.136
into a phenomenon.

02:16.179 --> 02:19.922
Also the dudes who created
Cyborg, Starfire,
and you, Mama.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.924
Created me? Give me a break.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.926
You doubt our creative power?

02:23.969 --> 02:26.189
Come on, Marv.
Let's show them.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.496
Creative geniuses.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.503
No way!

02:35.546 --> 02:36.895
We look so jacked!

02:36.939 --> 02:39.550
You think that's jacked?
Check this out!

02:40.638 --> 02:42.074
Mega-jacked!

02:42.118 --> 02:43.380
Whoa!

02:43.424 --> 02:45.904
- SuperMarv!
- And Super-George!

02:47.297 --> 02:49.560
Behold the power of the pen!

02:49.604 --> 02:52.172
You two truly are
creative geniuses!

02:54.739 --> 02:57.002
As a legendary comic writer,

02:57.046 --> 03:01.398
I have the power
to fill your speech balloons
with expertly crafted dialogue.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.878
Oh, really?

03:02.921 --> 03:04.706
Then let's see if you can
keep up with this.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.755
Impressive.

03:10.799 --> 03:14.455
It's time for
a double page spread!

03:15.847 --> 03:18.328
Look, it is
the Giant Mutant Chicken!

03:18.372 --> 03:21.288
Ugh! What is
a chicken doing here?

03:21.331 --> 03:23.594
It's our world.
We do what we want.

03:25.030 --> 03:28.512
Ahhh! Eat my friends,
just let me live.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.035
What's up with him?

03:30.079 --> 03:31.994
Our version of Robin
was a fearless leader.

03:32.037 --> 03:34.823
This version is just sad.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.219
See, Marv, this is why
I don't watch animation.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.831
Beast doomed.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.751
Titans, relax.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.318
We were just messing with you.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.669
You were messing with us?

03:54.712 --> 03:57.149
Yup, after four decades
of working together,

03:57.193 --> 04:00.370
we still love coming up
with new ways to
have fun with you guys.

04:00.414 --> 04:03.939
-It's what makes us...
Creative Geniuses!

04:03.982 --> 04:06.158
Well, you can keep your
creative geniuses to yourself.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.291
Come on, guys.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.554
Now, let's keep moving
so we can find that exclusive.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.557
Not so fast, Raven.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.994
The <i>Teen Titans Go!</i> panel
is starting in just
a few minutes.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.214
Really? I've always wanted
to be on a panel.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.259
Then follow me.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.653
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:22.697 --> 04:27.049
please welcome the stars of <i>
Teen Titans Go!</i>

04:27.092 --> 04:32.663
Scott Menville, Khary Payton,
Greg Cipes, Tara Strong
and Hynden Walch.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.711
Okay, who has the
first question for the cast?

04:36.754 --> 04:40.410
Wait, it's just
the voice actors
on the panel and not us?

04:40.454 --> 04:42.194
This has to be a mistake.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.327
Ahem, we have a question.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.329
You guys really nailed
those costumes.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.157
You look just like
the Teen Titans.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.290
We are the Teen Titans,

04:50.333 --> 04:52.920
and we want to know
why you guys get to be on
this panel instead of us?

04:52.944 --> 04:54.729
It's completely unfair, yo.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.079
You're right, this is unfair.

04:57.122 --> 05:00.430
We actors work in the safety
of a recording studio
at Warner Bros.

05:00.474 --> 05:04.782
while you guys,
the real heroes, are out there
facing danger 24/7.

05:04.826 --> 05:07.089
Well, it's not exactly 24/7.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.309
- We take a lot of naps.
- And play video games.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.354
And do the watching of the TV.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.791
In a typical week,
we average about...

05:13.835 --> 05:15.247
five minutes of
actual crime fighting.

05:15.271 --> 05:16.838
Yeah, give or take.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.449
Regardless, you guys should
totally join us up here.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.842
Don't mind if we do.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.934
Who's this
little cute papa-dog?

05:25.977 --> 05:28.023
This is my little bro.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.523
He's the wisest of the wise,
the highest form of life
on the planet.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.766
Isn't that right, little bro?

05:33.898 --> 05:36.466
Whoa! My man's a genius.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.163
I have a question.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.663
How do the writers come up
with all those scripts?

05:39.687 --> 05:41.776
Man, we don't use scripts.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.450
They just press record
and we party in the booth
like the Waffle episode.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.390
That whole thing just sprang
from us eating breakfast food.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.741
What do you enjoy the most
about playing the me?

05:50.785 --> 05:52.395
I love your big heart.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.875
Oh, thank you.

05:53.918 --> 05:57.618
- Let us do of the hugs.
- Hynden hyper hug.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.753
Oh, can I have a hug too?

06:03.798 --> 06:04.798
The no!

06:06.975 --> 06:09.804
I want to know what
secret acting technique
Tara uses to do my voice.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.762
It's simple.
I don't get much sleep.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.068
Now, smile for the camera.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.769
Oh, I've got a question
everyone is dying to know.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.382
Will Starfire and I,
finally fall in love
this coming season?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.514
Sorry, we can't give out
any spoilers.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.212
Don't play coy with me,
Scotty Boy.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.649
Answer the question!

06:28.692 --> 06:30.694
Whoa, whoa!
Easy there, little guy.

06:30.738 --> 06:31.913
These lips are sealed.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.436
I have ways of making you talk.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.615
Whoa, look at those abs.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.225
Guards!

06:40.269 --> 06:42.402
Ow, nice going, Robin.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.969
You just embarrassed us
in front of our fans.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.015
I knew coming here
was a bad idea.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.277
Maybe we should just go home.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.410
No! We can't go home.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.542
There's still plenty of fun
to be had.

06:52.586 --> 06:56.459
Plus, we still need
to locate the exclusive
Pretty Pretty Pegasus.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.027
You do not want to leave
the empty handed.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.898
Fine. We can stay.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.310
But we're going straight to the
Pretty Pretty Pegasus booth.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.684
- Got it?
- Totally, yo!

07:06.382 --> 07:09.385
Well, well, well,
the Teen Titans.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.169
Control Freak?

07:11.213 --> 07:14.216
What are you doing here,
you conniving couch potato?

07:14.259 --> 07:15.913
Isn't it obvious?

07:15.957 --> 07:19.395
I'm here for the
Pretty Pretty Pegasus
Exclusive.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.658
Well, you're too late
because I just bought
the last one.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.010
Oh, no. What am I gonna do?

07:28.796 --> 07:30.101
Give it back, Control Freak.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.407
Forget it.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.975
This limited edition
is mine now.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.846
Don't make us
take you down, dude.

07:35.890 --> 07:40.068
Oh, please, you can't
defeat me at Comic Book Con.

07:40.111 --> 07:44.289
This is the one place where
nerds like me reign supreme.

08:04.353 --> 08:07.225
You're no match for me, Titans.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.140
No way!

08:09.184 --> 08:11.336
Control Freak just turned
himself into an even
bigger nerd.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.144
We can't let him get away
with this.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.756
But how are we supposed to take
on all that nerd power?

08:15.799 --> 08:17.584
We're just five Titans.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.673
No, there's more.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.544
Five more to be exact.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.938
Teen Titans cast,
assemble!

08:46.264 --> 08:48.528
Teen Titans cast bot, go!

08:54.664 --> 08:56.405
Abs crunch!

08:58.973 --> 09:00.931
Swag bags of doom!

09:02.063 --> 09:03.107
Waffle shield!

09:06.720 --> 09:07.808
Flash on!

09:10.941 --> 09:12.073
Little Bro!

09:16.773 --> 09:18.688
Hynden Hyper Hug!

09:21.952 --> 09:25.608
Now, give up my
Pretty Pretty Pegasus.
It's over.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.175
Not yet.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.744
I still have one last trick
up my sleeve.

09:30.787 --> 09:34.051
The stench of a thousand nerds!

09:37.664 --> 09:42.016
Oh, we can't withstand,
ugh, that much body odor.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.496
We must summon the power of

09:44.540 --> 09:46.847
Marv Wolfman and George Perez.

09:49.110 --> 09:52.287
Creative Geniuses!

09:52.330 --> 09:54.594
Form Creative Sword!

10:02.776 --> 10:04.865
Wow!
That battle was amazing.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.258
I never knew
a comic book convention
could be so much fun.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.912
Here you go, Mama.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.741
Whoa! Wow!

10:11.785 --> 10:15.963
Thanks to the Titans cast bot
and super comic book legends
Marv and George,

10:16.006 --> 10:18.922
the Teen Titans
are once again victorious.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.272
That's
what's up, Titans!

10:21.316 --> 10:23.884
Oh, yeah, there's nothing
that could stop us.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.324
This is not
what I signed up for.
