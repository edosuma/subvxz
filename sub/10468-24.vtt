Doctor: HAVE YOU
FELT ANY MOVEMENT?

00:36.732 --> 00:38.299
NO. NOT YET.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.865
IS THAT OK?
I MEAN, IS THAT--

00:39.865 --> 00:41.693
ALL THAT MEANS IS
THAT IT'S TOO SOON,

00:41.693 --> 00:43.391
BUT YOU--YOU WILL.

00:43.391 --> 00:46.133

HEY, YOU MEAN THAT
IN A GENERIC NONSEX
SPECIFIC WAY, RIGHT?

01:07.632 --> 01:10.548
KIND OF LIKE HOW YOU
REFER TO A SHIP AS SHE.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.464
NO. KIND OF THE WAY
YOU REFER TO A BABY
WITH A PENIS.

01:16.032 --> 01:20.036
OH. I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

01:20.036 --> 01:23.083
GOD, DID I MISREAD
THE NOTATION ON YOUR FILE?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.127

01:24.127 --> 01:25.433
NO! IT'S--

01:25.433 --> 01:27.609
NO. WE WERE JUST
EXPECTING ONE OF THOSE--

01:27.609 --> 01:28.740
THOSE DRUM ROLL MOMENTS.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.177

I DON'T SEE IT.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.192
RIGHT THERE, YOU SEE?

01:45.192 --> 01:47.890

SO TINY.

01:47.890 --> 01:50.022
SO TEENY,
TEENY TINY.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.372
IT'S BARELY
ANYTHING.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.895
WELL, HE'LL GET BIGGER.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.157
YEAH. I HOPE SO.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.985
'CAUSE KIDS
CAN BE REALLY CRUEL.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.596
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA NAME HIM?

01:58.596 --> 02:00.250
HAVE YOU DECIDED?

02:00.250 --> 02:03.688
WELL, IT'S
A PRETTY SHORT LIST.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.430
YOU KNOW,
JERRY BOFFMAN'S
PARENTS,

02:06.430 --> 02:08.911
THEY LET HIM NAME
HIS BABY BROTHER.

02:08.911 --> 02:10.565
FRITZI.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.088
FRITZI?

02:12.088 --> 02:13.698
WELL, FRITZ.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.047
IT'S HIS DAD'S NAME.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.615
THAT'D BE KIND OF COOL
TO NAME THE KID AFTER,

02:17.615 --> 02:18.877
YOU KNOW, A RELATIVE.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.618
WELL, THAT'S SORT OF
ALONG THE SAME LINES

02:20.618 --> 02:22.098
THAT WE'RE THINKING OF
FOR THIS BABY.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.579
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO PICK THE NAME, OWEN--

02:24.579 --> 02:26.581
REALLY?
YOU'D LET ME DO THAT?

02:26.581 --> 02:28.104
REALLY?
YOU'D LET HIM DO THAT?

02:28.104 --> 02:30.672
YEAH. I MEAN, I THINK
IT'LL MEAN A LOT TO HIM

02:30.672 --> 02:32.848
TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT HIS
UNCLE OWEN GAVE HIM HIS NAME

02:32.848 --> 02:38.897
AND THAT THE NAME, IT HAD
A VERY, VERY SPECIAL MEANING
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.770
KIND OF LIKE
YOU NAMING DIANA
AFTER MOM.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.511
EXACTLY.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.341
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS EVERYTHING OK?

02:47.341 --> 02:50.779
OF COURSE. WHAT,
I CAN'T TREAT MY BROTHER
TO A NICE LUNCH?

02:50.779 --> 02:52.302
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.522
IT'S JUST IN 17 YEARS
YOU HAVEN'T.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.827
OH.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.003
YOU HAD THIS SORT OF

02:58.003 --> 03:00.571
"I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING" TONE
IN YOUR VOICE ON THE PHONE.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.312
YEAH, I DID.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.749
I DO.

03:04.749 --> 03:07.839
BAILEY, UM...

03:09.885 --> 03:12.017
I'M GOING TO JUILLIARD
IN THE FALL.

03:12.017 --> 03:14.281
WHAT?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.544
BUT I THOUGHT YOU'D
ACCEPTED STANFORD ALREADY.

03:16.544 --> 03:19.677
I DID, BUT JUST BECAUSE
IT WAS...WELL, SAFE...

03:19.677 --> 03:20.896
AND COMPLETELY DOABLE.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.985
BUT, I MEAN, JUILLIARD.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.422
THEY'RE OFFERING ME
A PRETTY OK
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.729
THEY'VE GOT A GREAT
WORK-STUDY PROGRAM.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.731
AND I WANT THIS.

03:29.731 --> 03:33.300
REALLY, IT JUST--
IT FEELS RIGHT.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.259
HELLO?

03:37.565 --> 03:41.351
YOU COULD SAY
SOMETHING.

03:41.351 --> 03:45.703
YOU MIGHT WANT TO BUDGET
SOME TRAIN TICKETS INTO
THE FINANCIAL EQUATION.

03:45.703 --> 03:49.272
I'M SORRY. YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE TRAINS BACK AND FORTH
TO SAN FRANCISCO?

03:49.272 --> 03:51.709
NO. NOT SAN FRANCISCO,
NOT HOME.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.494
PHILADELPHIA.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.930
PHILADELPHIA?

03:54.930 --> 03:56.932
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
IN PHILADELPHIA.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.413
YOU KNOW ME.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.894
SO, THAT'S CHARLIE.
CLAUD'S FREE.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.635
I JUST GOTTA CHECK
WITH BAILEY.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.724
COULDN'T YOU JUST TELL
EVERYBODY A LITTLE BIT
MORE CASUALLY?

04:06.724 --> 04:09.553
YOU KNOW,
BUMP INTO CHARLIE,
BREAK THE GOOD NEWS,

04:09.553 --> 04:11.729
SAY DON'T TELL BAILEY
'CAUSE I WANT
TO TELL HIM MYSELF,

04:11.729 --> 04:13.165
AND SO ON?

04:13.165 --> 04:15.429
NO! I WANT TO MAKE IT
A BIG DEAL!

04:15.429 --> 04:18.780
IT IS A BIG DEAL.
I'M MOVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.651
I'M STARTING A NEW JOB.
YOU'RE STARTING AT GEORGETOWN.

04:20.651 --> 04:24.089
I WANT TO MAKE AN EVENT
OUT OF THIS, YOU KNOW?

04:24.089 --> 04:25.874
WHAT?

04:25.874 --> 04:28.964
YOU KNOW YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE BIT MANIC
ABOUT THIS?

04:33.751 --> 04:36.145
OK, I JUST, UM...

04:36.145 --> 04:38.408
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A SERIES OF HEART-TO-HEARTS.

04:38.408 --> 04:41.890
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS
OF LEAVING EVERYONE BEHIND.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.675
I'M NOT GONNA TREAT THIS
LIKE A MIXED BLESSING.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.938
I WANT TO STAND UP AT SALINGER'S
WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE

04:46.938 --> 04:48.679
AND SAY, "HEY!
GUESS WHAT I'M LEAVING TO DO

04:48.679 --> 04:50.290
"AND GUESS
WHO'S COMING WITH ME

04:50.290 --> 04:51.943
"AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M REALLY EXCITED!

04:51.943 --> 04:54.381
AND YOU ALL DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE BUT TO BE
EXCITED FOR ME."

04:54.381 --> 04:55.904
YOU KNOW?

04:55.904 --> 04:57.514
GOT YA.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.255

05:05.566 --> 05:07.307
YOU GUYS ORDER YOUR FOOD
AND RELAX.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.004
I WANT TO BUILD
THE SUSPENSE.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.440
SO, WHAT'S EVERYBODY

05:10.440 --> 05:13.225

05:18.318 --> 05:19.797

05:19.797 --> 05:21.364
IN A COUPLE MONTHS,
I'M GOING TO BE LEAVING

05:32.201 --> 05:33.855

05:33.855 --> 05:36.118
I HAD TO WORK IT OUT
WITH CHARLIE AND OWEN FIRST,

05:36.118 --> 05:37.380
AND I JUST TOLD CLAUDIA
THIS MORNING.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.077
HEY, JULE,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

05:39.077 --> 05:41.123
THE PROBLEM IS
YOU CAN'T BE DOING THAT.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.038
BAILEY,
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.953
THAT'S--THAT'S MY NEWS.
I'M LEAVING.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.042

05:47.042 --> 05:49.914
I GOT OFFERED A JOB

ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.833

HE ALREADY TRANSFERRED
TO GEORGETOWN.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.792
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE GETTING ENGAGED.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.402
ENGAGED? WHAT,
ARE YOU CLUELESS?

05:59.402 --> 06:01.273

06:07.932 --> 06:09.499
WHAT ABOUT STANFORD?

06:09.499 --> 06:10.500
I CHANGED MY MIND.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.545
WAIT--
WAIT A SECOND.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.068
WAIT JUST A SECOND.CHARLIE--

06:13.068 --> 06:14.678
NO. THIS IS GETTING
A LITTLE OUT OF HAND
HERE.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.854
BAILEY AND I TALKED
ABOUT HIM LEAVING.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.900
SO--SO WHAT
DOES THAT MATTER?

06:18.900 --> 06:20.641
HE TALKED TO YOU FIRST,
SO HE GETS TO GO?

06:20.641 --> 06:21.816
I MEAN,
HOW IS THAT FAIR?

06:21.816 --> 06:23.121
MINE IS SET ALREADY,
JULIA.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.340
WELL, SO IS MINE,
BAILEY.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.734
MINE, TOO.
Owen: HEY!
WHAT ABOUT ME?

06:26.734 --> 06:29.084
WHO'S GONNA STAY WITH ME
AND CHARLIE IF YOU ALL GO?

06:45.143 --> 06:46.406
YOU MIND?

06:55.153 --> 06:56.894
WE'VE GOT
A PROBLEM HERE.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.158
NO KIDDING.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.987
WH-WHENEVER ONE OF US
GOES AWAY,

07:02.987 --> 07:05.337
THE REST OF US,
WE JUST KIND OF...

07:05.337 --> 07:07.165
I DON'T KNOW,
CLOSE THE CIRCLE,

07:07.165 --> 07:09.429
WAITING FOR THAT PERSON
TO COME BACK.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.474
AND WE'VE DEALT WITH
THAT PLENTY OF TIMES,

07:11.474 --> 07:13.781
BUT THIS?
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.784
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

07:16.784 --> 07:21.049
JUST THINK ABOUT IT,
BAILEY.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.791
LOOK, YOU GOT
A GREAT INTERNSHIP.

07:23.791 --> 07:27.272
I UNDERSTAND THAT, OK?

07:27.272 --> 07:30.624
BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU
COULD GET ANOTHER ONE
JUST LIKE IT NEXT YEAR.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.800
YOU KNOW THAT.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.759
YOU HAVE A GREAT RESUME.
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING
YOU WANT, JULIA.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.457
ANYTHING.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.460
WELL, I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.375
I NEED HELP.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.466
I HAVE TO GET LUCKY.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.078
WELL, THIS GUY
THAT CHARLIE KNOWS,

07:50.078 --> 07:51.906
HE'S PULLING STRINGS
FOR ME BIG TIME.

07:51.906 --> 07:56.040
I WON'T GET A CHANCE
AT A BUSINESS DEGREE

07:56.040 --> 08:00.001
FROM AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL
EVER AGAIN.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.219
EVER AGAIN...

08:01.219 --> 08:03.526
IF I GIVE THIS UP.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.576
I TOLD THEM YES
IN WASHINGTON.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.187
BAILEY, I TOLD
MY SCHOOL.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.149
I'M ALWAYS THE ONE
WHO BACKS DOWN.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.674
I'M ALWAYS THE ONE
THAT GETS STUCK HERE.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.505
I'M NOT GIVING IN THIS TIME.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.694
I WORRIED ABOUT
ALL THE WRONG THINGS,
DIDN'T I?

08:40.694 --> 08:42.478
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:42.478 --> 08:45.699
I SPENT ALL THIS TIME
TRYING TO WORK THINGS
OUT WITH BAILEY,

08:45.699 --> 08:48.179
TRYING TO MAKE PEACE
WITH THE IDEA
OF HIM LEAVING,

08:48.179 --> 08:52.401
NEGOTIATING
ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS--
OWEN AND THE HOUSE,

08:52.401 --> 08:58.886
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
FOR ME AND JULIA AND
CLAUDIA TO BE WITHOUT HIM--

08:58.886 --> 09:00.757
WHAT A COMPLETE
WASTE OF TIME.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.810
IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE
HOW THINGS WORK OUT,
ISN'T IT?

09:09.810 --> 09:12.987
I MEAN, WAY BACK...
IN THE BEGINNING,

09:12.987 --> 09:14.902
RIGHT AFTER
MOM AND DAD DIED,

09:14.902 --> 09:18.558
AND BEFORE THAT, TOO.
I MEAN...

09:18.558 --> 09:22.910
I WAS THE ONE
WHO DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.389
GOD, I DIDN'T--

09:24.389 --> 09:27.131
I DIDN'T WANT ANY OF IT.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.135
AND NOW I'M THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S LEFT.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.142
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.819
WHAT DID HE SAY?

10:30.891 --> 10:34.111
YOU USING THE WASHER STILL?
I'VE GOT A LOAD HERE.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.505
YEAH. THAT'S FINE.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.203
YOU STAYED OVER,
HUH?

10:39.203 --> 10:40.770
YEP.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.601
LOOK, I'M SURE YOU
AND JULIA TALKED

10:45.601 --> 10:46.950
ABOUT WHAT SHE HAD--

10:46.950 --> 10:48.169
NO. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.824
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

10:50.824 --> 10:53.261
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED,
RIGHT?

10:53.261 --> 10:54.828
WHAT?

10:57.439 --> 10:58.832
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU YET?

11:00.268 --> 11:02.139
SHE'S NOT GOING.

11:02.139 --> 11:05.577
SHE'S BEEN CALLING
WASHINGTON THIS MORNING
TURNING DOWN HER JOB,

11:05.577 --> 11:08.929
SO YOU GO, SHE STAYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.895
LISTEN, JUSTIN,
WHEN I APPLIED,
I HAD NO IDEA--

11:18.895 --> 11:21.855
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I KNOW, BAILEY, I KNOW.

11:21.855 --> 11:24.988
THIS IS THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY
YOU'VE EVER HAD, RIGHT?

11:24.988 --> 11:27.425
SHE EXPLAINED IT ALL
VERY CLEARLY.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.994
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT

11:30.994 --> 11:32.866
WHO MAKES THE BEST
CAREER MOVE.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.606
MEANING WHAT?

11:34.606 --> 11:37.174
MEANING IT IS ALSO
ABOUT HER AND ME,

11:37.174 --> 11:39.568
ABOUT BEING IN LOVE
AND GETTING OUT OF HERE.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.136
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HERE?

11:42.136 --> 11:43.659
ARE YOU KIDDING?

11:43.659 --> 11:46.793
BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU.
BECAUSE...WHEN SHE'S HERE,

11:46.793 --> 11:48.664
SHE CAN'T GET AWAY
FROM HER FAMILY.

11:48.664 --> 11:52.886
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKES,
LOOK AT THE DECISION
THAT SHE JUST MADE.

11:52.886 --> 11:56.411
THROWING AWAY ALL OF
HER PLANS JUST FOR YOU.

12:03.940 --> 12:08.728
YOU KNOW, A GOOD SCHOOL
IS NOT THE ONLY CHANCE
IN LIFE

12:08.728 --> 12:10.904
THAT DOESN'T
COME AROUND TWICE.

12:19.303 --> 12:23.220
HEY, CHAR, I DECIDED
ON A NAME FOR THE BABY.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.007
YOU HAVE?

12:27.007 --> 12:29.574
YEAH. I THOUGHT A LOT
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.968
YOU DID?

12:31.968 --> 12:34.971
HOW IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO NAME HIM AFTER SOMEONE
WHO MATTERS TO ME.

12:36.364 --> 12:38.453
SOMEONE WHO I
KIND OF OWE A LOT TO.

12:38.453 --> 12:42.892
OK...I THINK I KNOW
WHERE THIS IS GOING,
BUT LAY IT ON ME.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.894
STEWY.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.987
I'M SORRY. STEWY?

12:50.987 --> 12:53.816
AFTER STEWY DETILLO.
HE'S ON MY SOCCER TEAM.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.776
STEWY? YOU WANNA
NAME THE BABY STEWY?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.866
CHAR, STEWY DETILLO
IS, LIKE, AMAZING.

12:59.866 --> 13:03.391
HE SCORED 5 GOALS
LAST SATURDAY.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.654
HE'S REALLY GOOD AT FLICKING
BOOGERS ACROSS THE ROOM.

13:05.654 --> 13:08.265
WOULDN'T THAT BE COOL
IF THE BABY COULD DO THAT?

13:08.265 --> 13:12.356
BUT YOU'RE INDEBTED
TO HIM HOW EXACTLY?

13:12.356 --> 13:16.273
OWEN, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO NAME THE BABY AFTER
SOMEONE YOU OWE A LOT TO.

13:16.273 --> 13:19.059
BUT YOU SAID I COULD PICK.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.979
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.416
IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION,
BAILEY. IT'S MINE.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.158
YEAH, BUT YOU WANT
TO GO TO JUILLIARD.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.290
I JUST SAT ACROSS FROM YOU
AT LUNCH YESTERDAY.

13:33.290 --> 13:38.556
YEAH, SO? MAYBE
THAT'S NOT WHERE
I'M MEANT TO BE.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.167
MAYBE THE GREATEST
TEACHER I'LL EVER HAVE

13:40.167 --> 13:42.256
IS SITTING IN A CLASSROOM
AT STANFORD RIGHT NOW.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.824
MAYBE MY CLOSEST,
LIFELONG FRIEND

13:44.824 --> 13:47.827
HAS GOT HER
ACCEPTANCE THERE, TOO.
YOU NEVER KNOW.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.525
IS THAT REALLY
WHAT YOU THINK?

13:50.525 --> 13:54.834
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU GO, YOUR FIRST CHOICE,
YOUR SECOND CHOICE?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.706
I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.839 --> 14:04.104
HERE'S THE THING, BAILEY--
FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS,

14:04.104 --> 14:06.584
IT'S BEEN PRETTY MUCH
A ONE-WAY STREET,

14:06.584 --> 14:09.805
WITH YOU
TAKING CARE OF ME.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.328
NO.

14:13.156 --> 14:17.204
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT WENT BOTH WAYS.

14:17.204 --> 14:20.163
WE'RE EVEN, CLAUD.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.731
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

14:22.731 --> 14:27.344
YOU AND CHARLIE
AND JULIA STAYED HERE
AND KEPT US TOGETHER,

14:27.344 --> 14:30.173
FOR ME AND FOR OWEN.

14:30.173 --> 14:33.176
YOU WERE 16.

14:35.222 --> 14:38.355
YOUNGER THAN I AM NOW.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.445
AND YOU DID ALL THAT
FOR ME.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.102
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.897
HEY.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.769
YOU'RE PAYING 38 AND A QUARTER
FOR A FLAT OF BRAZILIAN CHERRY?

15:00.769 --> 15:04.773
YEAH, WELL, STAMSON
RAISED HIS PRICES.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.602
WELL, HE STILL OWES US
8 FLATS FROM MARCH.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.344
YOU MAKE SURE YOU HOLD HIM
TO THE OLD PRICE.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.042
WHAT IS THIS, YOU TAKE THE KID
OUT OF THE BUSINESS,

15:13.042 --> 15:15.740
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE BUSINESS
OUT OF THE KID?

15:15.740 --> 15:18.874
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
YEAH.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.271
JUST DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN
I COME CRAWLING BACK HERE.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.971
I HAD A NICE
COUPLE OF DAYS THERE,

15:28.971 --> 15:31.582
THINKING I COULD
ACTUALLY DO IT.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.194
I COULD ACTUALLY
TAKE OFF,

15:34.194 --> 15:35.804
HEAD BACK EAST.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.501
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:37.501 --> 15:42.767
IF I GO, THEN
EVERYTHING UNRAVELS
FOR JULIA AND CLAUDIA.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.118
THEY WON'T GO
IF I GO.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.816
WAIT.
THEY SAID THAT?

15:47.816 --> 15:50.558
CLAUDIA TOLD ME SHE'S
SAYING YES TO STANFORD,

15:50.558 --> 15:54.562
AND JUSTIN SAID THAT
JULIA'S BACKING OUT.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.262
AND, UH...

16:02.570 --> 16:04.485
WHY ARE YOU STAYING?

16:04.485 --> 16:09.751
I TRIED SAYING,
"NO, FORGET IT.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.406
THIS IS MY TURN
TO LEAVE."

16:12.406 --> 16:17.628
BUT...LET'S
BE HONEST HERE.

16:17.628 --> 16:20.718
IF THE GUILT
DIDN'T KILL ME,

16:20.718 --> 16:24.287
IT'D JUST GET ME FLUNKED OUT
AND SENT BACK HOME, ANYWAY.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.638
AND BY THAT TIME,
JULIA WILL HAVE LOST
THIS INTERNSHIP,

16:27.638 --> 16:31.077
AND THEY WOULD'VE
GIVEN CLAUD'S SPOT
AT JUILLIARD AWAY,

16:31.077 --> 16:33.731
SO I'M JUST GONNA
BOW OUT NOW,

16:33.731 --> 16:36.473
AND I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.302
BAILEY, MAYBE
THERE'S A WAY--

16:39.302 --> 16:44.655
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT REALLY
SUCH A HORRIBLE THING

16:44.655 --> 16:47.136
TO PUT THEM FIRST.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.835
I MEAN, I LOVE THEM.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.320
I'LL GET MY CHANCE
SOME OTHER TIME.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.148
BAILEY, LISTEN.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.628
CHARLIE...

17:02.543 --> 17:04.675
YOU DON'T NEED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.155
IT'S OK.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.726
I MEAN, NO.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.511
OBVIOUSLY
IT'S NOT OK,

17:14.511 --> 17:17.558
BUT IT'S HOW IT IS.

17:19.429 --> 17:23.172
WE'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO SAY THAT ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS

17:23.172 --> 17:25.348
FOR A LONG TIME NOW,
HAVEN'T WE?

17:26.828 --> 17:30.136
"IT'S NOT OK.
IT'S JUST HOW IT IS."

17:34.792 --> 17:38.927
ANYWAY...I'LL SEE YA.

17:49.329 --> 17:52.636
JULIA, YOU HOME?
JULE.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.160
CHARLIE?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.597
CLAUDIA.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.904
CHARLIE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:59.904 --> 18:03.038
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
OWEN, TOO. IS HE HERE?

18:03.038 --> 18:05.432
WHAT HAPPENED?
SOMETHING HAPPEN?

18:05.432 --> 18:06.694
CHARLIE,
IS KIRSTEN OK?

18:06.694 --> 18:08.870
SHE'S FINE. IT'S, UH...

18:08.870 --> 18:11.525
IT'S WHAT?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.053
LOOK, UH...

18:18.053 --> 18:22.536
I DO THIS THING
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.190
IT'S KIND OF A REFLEX

18:24.190 --> 18:26.888
WHERE I ASK MYSELF
WHAT THEY WOULD DO.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.803
WHAT ANSWER
WOULD THEY HAVE

18:28.803 --> 18:31.414
IF 3 OF THEIR KIDS
CAME TO THEM WITH
A GOOD REASON TO LEAVE,

18:31.414 --> 18:35.201
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
THAT WAS GONNA TAKE THEM
FAR AWAY?

18:35.201 --> 18:38.334
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY?

18:38.334 --> 18:39.814
AND, UH...

18:42.208 --> 18:44.035
THEY'D SAY GO.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.344
YOU SHOULD GO,
THE THREE OF YOU.

18:48.344 --> 18:52.087
NO, THEY WOULDN'T.
THEY WOULD WANT US
TO STAY TOGETHER.

18:52.087 --> 18:55.873
WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS ALREADY.
WE CAN'T ALL LEAVE.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.092
IT'S TOO MUCH,
ALL THREE OF US.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.225
AND THEY WOULDN'T
WANT THAT.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.792
I KNOW
THEY WOULDN'T.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.011
CLAUDIA, IF THEY WERE ALIVE,

19:03.011 --> 19:04.621
WE ALL WOULD'VE LEFT
YEARS AGO.

19:04.621 --> 19:05.753
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.363
OH, COME ON.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.278
JULIA AND BAILEY
WOULD'VE BEEN
OUT THAT DOOR AT 18.

19:09.278 --> 19:12.716
YOU WOULD'VE GONE OFF
TO COLLEGE WITHOUT
EVEN A LOOK BACK.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.850
AND NONE OF US
WOULD KNOW OWEN.

19:15.850 --> 19:19.288
I'D BARELY KNOW
ANY OF YOU, AND NONE
OF YOU WOULD KNOW ME,

19:19.288 --> 19:22.073
I WOULD'VE BEEN
OUT OF THE HOUSE
FOR SO LONG.

19:22.073 --> 19:25.338
MAYBE WE'D CATCH UP
ONCE A YEAR
AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY

19:25.338 --> 19:26.861
OR CHRISTMAS MORNING,

19:26.861 --> 19:28.863
BUT WE'D BE OFF
LIVING SEPARATE LIVES.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.734
AND THAT WOULDN'T
BE A TRAGEDY.

19:30.734 --> 19:34.173
IT'D JUST BE HOW
IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

19:37.132 --> 19:40.614
THE TRUTH IS,
WE'VE STAYED TOGETHER

19:40.614 --> 19:43.747
SO MUCH LONGER
THAN MOST FAMILIES.

19:43.747 --> 19:48.099
WE'VE TAKEN CARE
OF EACH OTHER
SO MUCH LONGER.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.319
AND...

19:50.319 --> 19:53.801
IT'S GOTTA BE OK
TO TAKE CARE
OF OURSELVES NOW.

19:53.801 --> 20:00.677
IT'S, UH...IT'S HARD
TO IMAGINE ALL OF US
IN DIFFERENT PLACES.

20:00.677 --> 20:04.159
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
EVENTUALLY.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.858
BAY...

20:07.858 --> 20:09.991
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.997
THIS WORKS FOR US,
STAYING CLOSE.

20:17.738 --> 20:20.001
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
MESS WITH THAT.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.308
FOR HOW LONG?

20:22.308 --> 20:24.223
FOREVER?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.964
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT
CHILDREN ANYMORE.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.576
WE WERE THEN.
EVEN ME AT 24,

20:29.576 --> 20:32.492
I WAS LOST
AND TERRIFIED,

20:32.492 --> 20:34.363
AND NONE OF US KNEW
HOW TO GET THROUGH IT

20:34.363 --> 20:36.409
EXCEPT TO STAY TOGETHER.

20:36.409 --> 20:40.195
THAT WAS OUR LIFEBOAT--
EACH OTHER--

20:40.195 --> 20:42.980
AND WE JUST GOT IN
AND HELD ON SO TIGHTLY.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.373
THAT'S HOW WE MADE IT.

20:44.373 --> 20:47.550
BUT NOW IT'S 6 YEARS LATER,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.813
AND WE ALL WANT GOOD THINGS
FOR EACH OTHER.

20:49.813 --> 20:53.426
WE ALL WANT EACH OTHER
TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE
CHANCE AT BEING HAPPY.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.386
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

21:00.041 --> 21:03.610
DOESN'T THAT MEAN
WE GOT IT RIGHT?

21:03.610 --> 21:05.089
I MEAN, DOESN'T IT?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.789
YEAH.

21:11.531 --> 21:14.229
BUT NOT IF WE BELIEVE
THAT WE'RE ONLY A FAMILY

21:14.229 --> 21:16.840
IF WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH
TO TOUCH.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.408
IF THAT'S
WHAT WE WERE LEFT
WITH, THEN WE'VE...

21:19.408 --> 21:21.454
WE'VE FAILED.

21:24.065 --> 21:27.460
WE'VE SURVIVED SO MUCH MORE
THAN DISTANCE.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.505
DISTANCE IS NOTHING.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.381
YOU SHOULD GO.

21:48.045 --> 21:51.092
WHAT IF WE HAD RULES?

21:51.092 --> 21:54.051
WHAT IF AGREED UP-FRONT
TO CERTAIN THINGS,

21:54.051 --> 21:58.404
THINGS THAT WOULD
MAKE US BEING SEPARATED
FEEL LESS DRASTIC?

21:58.404 --> 22:00.144
LIKE?

22:00.144 --> 22:05.062
I DON'T KNOW. LIKE
A FAMILY CONFERENCE CALL
EVERY SUNDAY

22:05.062 --> 22:06.542
AT THE SAME TIME EVERY WEEK

22:06.542 --> 22:09.240
SO THAT NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE
OR WHAT WE'RE DOING,

22:09.240 --> 22:10.416
WE CONNECT.

22:12.069 --> 22:15.856
YEAH. AND EVERYONE
COMES HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.074
AND EASTER.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.989
AND OWEN'S BIRTHDAY.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.602
WHAT ABOUT WHEN
THE BABY'S BORN?

22:22.602 --> 22:25.256
WE COME HOME FOR THAT.

22:25.256 --> 22:29.783
YEAH. THE IMPORTANT STUFF
WE ALWAYS COME HOME FOR.

22:29.783 --> 22:31.698
AND IT'LL JUST BE UNDERSTOOD.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.710
Kirsten: HEY, DID YOU
GET THE SPACKLE?

22:43.710 --> 22:47.931
YOU KNOW, THE SPACKLE TO FILL
THE NAIL HOLES IN DIANA'S ROOM?

22:47.931 --> 22:52.545
OTHERWISE, WE'RE GONNA
LOSE OUR SECURITY DEPOSIT.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.198
CHARLIE.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.115
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

23:00.727 --> 23:02.163
HEY.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.644
WHERE ARE YOU?

23:04.644 --> 23:09.170
OH...NOWHERE.
JUST...HERE.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.916
LOOK AT US. MOVING.

23:17.787 --> 23:21.400
I'M NOT GONNA MISS THAT
SHOWER OR THE DISPOSAL.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.794
GOD, CHARLIE, I HAVE
A DISHWASHER AGAIN

23:24.794 --> 23:26.056
AND A BACKYARD.

23:27.493 --> 23:30.974
IT'S NOT A GREAT HOUSE,
YOU KNOW.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.020
WHAT?

23:33.020 --> 23:35.936
KIDS, THE BABY. IT'S--

23:35.936 --> 23:39.374
IT'S 52 STEPS
UP TO THE FRONT DOOR.

23:39.374 --> 23:40.680
PULLING A STROLLER
UP AND DOWN THAT

23:40.680 --> 23:42.029
WILL TAKE YEARS
OFF YOUR LIFE.

23:42.029 --> 23:45.598
AND THE WALK TO THE PARK
IS STRAIGHT UPHILL.

23:45.598 --> 23:48.339
LAUNDRY IS 4 FLIGHTS AWAY.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.341
WAIT, HOW DO
YOU FIGURE THAT?

23:50.341 --> 23:52.213
2 DOWN, 2 UP.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.823
AND 6 IF YOU'RE
COMING FROM THE ATTIC.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.391
I MEAN, WITH BABIES,
THAT'S ALL YOU DO IS LAUNDRY.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.611
WE'RE GONNA SPEND OUR WHOLE
LIVES GOING UP AND DOWN STEPS.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.961
CHARLIE.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.833
YOUR PARENTS RAISED
A LOT OF KIDS
IN THIS HOUSE

24:03.833 --> 24:07.663
WITH TOO FEW BEDROOMS
AND TOO MANY STEPS.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.231
NO ONE TUMBLED
DOWN THE STAIRS

24:10.231 --> 24:12.538
OR HAD A HEART ATTACK
DOING LAUNDRY.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.583
THEY WERE HAPPY THERE.
ALL YOU KIDS WERE.

24:14.583 --> 24:15.715
YOU WERE HAPPY.

24:21.938 --> 24:25.507
MAYBE IT'S THAT BAILEY
AND JULIA AND CLAUDIA

24:25.507 --> 24:27.596
ARE ALL GOING
SOME PLACE THEY'VE
NEVER BEEN BEFORE,

24:27.596 --> 24:31.774
AND YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO A PLACE YOU'VE KNOWN
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

24:34.081 --> 24:37.345
IT'S NEVER REALLY
GONNA BELONG TO ME.

24:37.345 --> 24:41.088
TO MY KIDS, TO MY FAMILY.

24:43.699 --> 24:47.747
IT'S MY FATHER'S HOUSE.

24:47.747 --> 24:50.489
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA
BE MY FATHER'S HOUSE.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.885
WELL,

24:55.885 --> 25:00.847
I KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO
ABOUT THAT, CHARLIE.

25:07.636 --> 25:11.248
W-WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HANG ON A SECOND.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.076
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

25:13.076 --> 25:15.165
YOU KNOW--I MEAN,
HOW MANY TIMES

25:15.165 --> 25:16.906
HAVE WE GOTTEN
A CALL FROM A BROKER

25:16.906 --> 25:19.430
SAYING, "I HAVE A CLIENT
WHO WAS DRIVING DOWN
YOUR STREET--"

25:19.430 --> 25:21.737
YOU WANNA SELL THE HOUSE?

25:21.737 --> 25:24.305
LOOK, I MADE A FEW CALLS,
JUST CHECKING THINGS OUT.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.220
AND YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW MUCH WE COULD
GET FOR THE PLACE.

25:26.220 --> 25:29.440
CHARLIE, COULD YOU PLEASE--

25:29.440 --> 25:32.705
I'M STILL TRYING
TO WORK ON THE IDEA
OF EVERYBODY LEAVING.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.228
YOU'RE MOVING
AT WARP SPEED HERE.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.796
I REALIZE THAT
IT FEELS THAT WAY RIGHT NOW.

25:36.796 --> 25:39.233
BUT, I MEAN, YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA BE GONE ALL THE TIME.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.496
AND, YEAH,
WE CAN WAIT A FEW YEARS,

25:41.496 --> 25:44.020
BUT THE MARKET
IS SO HOT RIGHT NOW.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.979
IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT THAT, CHARLIE.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.981
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.722
THIS IS THEIR HOME.

25:49.722 --> 25:50.940
MOM AND DAD'S.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.595
WE'LL STILL HAVE
THE RESTAURANT, JULE.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.947
I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO COME BACK HERE, CHARLIE.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.862
IT'S WHY I'M OK
GOING BACK EAST.

25:59.862 --> 26:02.735
'CAUSE I KNOW WE CAN
COME BACK HOME ANYTIME
WE WANT AND BE TOGETHER.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.258
I'LL HAVE A PLACE.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.564
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S BIG ENOUGH

26:05.564 --> 26:08.610
FOR EVERYBODY
TO COME BACK HOME TO.

26:08.610 --> 26:12.962
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS
I KIND OF WANT TO START
MY OWN TRADITIONS.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.660
SO HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.792
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA SELL THIS PLACE
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER?

26:16.792 --> 26:18.402
WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY
THAT LOVES THE HOUSE

26:18.402 --> 26:19.795
JUST AS MUCH AS WE DO.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.232
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.452
SORRY.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.454
LOOK, WHEN WE
WERE ALL LIVING HERE,

26:26.454 --> 26:28.891
I WOULD HAVE NEVER SAID
THAT I'D RATHER HAVE
THE MONEY THAN THE HOUSE.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.893
BUT FOR THE FEW WEEKS THAT
YOU'LL ALL BE BACK HERE,

26:30.893 --> 26:35.289
IT JUST--WELL,
THOSE MEMORIES ARE STARTING
TO GET VERY EXPENSIVE.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.813
OH, THAT'S
REALLY NICE, CHARLIE.

26:37.813 --> 26:40.468
YEAH, VERY
MOVINGLY PUT.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.644
LOOK, YOU GUYS,
BOTTOM LINE:

26:42.644 --> 26:44.603
IF WE SELL,

26:44.603 --> 26:47.431
CLAUDIA DOESN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT WORK STUDY
TO PAY FOR JUILLIARD.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.172
IT'S PAID FOR, PERIOD.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.566
THE SAME FOR YOU, BAILEY.
SCHOOL IS PAID FOR.

26:51.566 --> 26:54.569
AND JULIA AND JUSTIN
CAN GET THEMSELVES
SET UP IN WASHINGTON.

26:54.569 --> 26:58.355
AND OWEN IS TAKEN CARE OF
UNTIL HE'S GROWN UP.

26:58.355 --> 27:02.403
I MEAN, THAT HOUSE
PAYS FOR ALL OF OUR FUTURES.

27:07.538 --> 27:10.629
WOW, THAT'S--WOW!

27:10.629 --> 27:13.544
UH, THAT MUST
BE KIND OF WEIRD FOR YOU.

27:13.544 --> 27:14.894
UH, RIGHT AWAY?

27:16.330 --> 27:19.376

TALKED TO A BROKER.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.770
SHE SAYS A VICTORIAN
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

27:21.770 --> 27:24.686
WITH A VIEW OF THE BAY
WILL GO FAST.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.775
SHE ALREADY
WANTS TO START
BRINGING PEOPLE BY.

27:26.775 --> 27:30.692
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER
START CLEANING THIS STUFF OUT.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.955
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT THE SALE.

27:32.955 --> 27:37.568
TRUTH IS I SHOULD HAVE
MOVED OUT OF HERE
A LONG TIME AGO.

27:37.568 --> 27:40.659
IT'S GETTING HARDER
AND HARDER TO EXPLAIN
WHY I'M STILL WORKING

27:40.659 --> 27:43.966
AT THE SAME PLACE
I USED TO LIVE
WITH MY EX-WIFE,

27:43.966 --> 27:45.185

TO MY GIRLFRIEND.

NO, NO.

I THINK SHE UNDERSTANDS

27:54.934 --> 27:57.284

ABOUT BEING...

27:57.284 --> 27:58.938
CLOSE TO YOUR FAMILY.

27:58.938 --> 28:02.942

I'M A PART OF THAT.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.770
SHE'S BIG ON FAMILY.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.294

WELL, YOU WERE
ALWAYS GOOD WITH OWEN.

GONNA BE THE SAME KIDS.

NO.

KNOW EACH OTHER.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.580
THEY'LL BE FRIENDS.

28:32.580 --> 28:35.017
THEY'LL KNOW
WE LOVED EACH OTHER.

LOVE EACH OTHER.

WHEN THE WEATHER'S NICE,

28:46.812 --> 28:48.335
YOU JUST OPEN UP
THE FRENCH DOORS.

OUTSIDE AND INSIDE.

BEFORE WE GO OUTSIDE?

ROB, CLAIRE, YOU WANT
TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
UPSTAIRS?

ALL THE RIGHT ROOMS.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WATCH THEM ON THE STAIRS.

29:13.839 --> 29:16.885
Claire: THOSE 2 SMALL ROOMS
ARE GONNA BE PERFECT
FOR THEM.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.583
WE COULD PUT THE CRIB
IN THE ONE BY THE MASTER.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.543
WELL, ONCE THEY GET OLDER,
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO MOVE UP
INTO THE ATTIC, ANYWAY.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.850
OH, GOD! I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO THINK ABOUT

29:24.850 --> 29:26.721
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA
GET INTO UP THERE!

AT THE BACKYARD?

BUT I'VE HAD
17 YEARS HERE.
