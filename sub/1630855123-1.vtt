02:29.441 --> 02:30.776
Mm-hmm.

02:30.859 --> 02:31.860
Ugh.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.196
The gods whisper to the warrior,

03:16.280 --> 03:18.699
"You will not withstand the fury."

03:20.117 --> 03:21.118
Hi-yah!

03:22.619 --> 03:24.788
The warrior whispers back…

03:24.872 --> 03:26.081
Hi-yah!

03:26.832 --> 03:27.833
Whoa!

03:29.209 --> 03:32.171
…"I am the fury!"

03:45.517 --> 03:49.605
I am the fury.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.529
Hey.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.867
Hey, how you doing?

04:04.119 --> 04:05.287
All good in the hood.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.122
Nice.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.672
So,

04:15.756 --> 04:17.925
wanna help me with a vid
for my channel?

04:19.551 --> 04:20.802
Nah, I don't know.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.890
Please.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.476
Please. Please.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.228
-I'm really busy.
-Please, Lena.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.855
-No. No.
-Please. Please!

04:31.939 --> 04:33.941
Oh, my God. I said no.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.276
-Please! Please.
-No. No!

04:36.360 --> 04:40.697
The gods whisper to the warrior,
"You will not withstand the fury."

04:41.240 --> 04:42.866
The warrior whispers back…

04:44.493 --> 04:46.036
Hi-yah!

04:47.579 --> 04:48.664
Yah!

04:49.373 --> 04:51.792
…"I am the fury."

04:57.130 --> 04:58.924
It's all good. Get up. Shake it off.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.634
Why can't I get it?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.845
-You're fine. That was dope, though.
-Okay.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.472
All right. Okay.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.391
Ria, you got this. You're amazing.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.601
You're sick. You're dope. You're awesome.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.437
I am the fury.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.607
Hi-yah!

05:16.483 --> 05:17.526
Cut.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.874
Lads, I'm nervous.

05:31.957 --> 05:32.958
You got this.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.252
You done all the necessary paperwork.
You're golden.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.713
-What is that?
-It's Marc Jacobs. It'll hide the scent.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.966
You can't let Spence smell your fear.
She's a bloodhound for the stuff.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.676
Desist, man.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.678
Relax.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.430
Hey. Handshake.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.265
-Handshake.
-Handshake.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.643
-One.
-Two.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.146
-Three.
-Click.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.940
-Virgins.
-Your dad's a slag, Edith!

06:03.822 --> 06:08.368
Ms. Khan, would you say a career
as a stuntwoman is a serious one?

06:08.452 --> 06:09.494
Affirmative.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.414
If it's an arse-kicking you're after,
I could give you that for free.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.836
Alba's doing
her work experience with an actor.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.463
How is that any more serious?

06:19.546 --> 06:22.925
Well, that's with Alba's aunt
at the Royal Shakespeare Company.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.051
That's different.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.887
Then why isn't Kovacs studying
the inner workings of money laundering

06:26.970 --> 06:28.305
with her father in prison?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.516
It was insider trading, you prick.

06:32.559 --> 06:36.980
It says here that you'd like to do your
internship with stuntwoman Eunice Huthart.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.441
Yes. A leading light
on the UK stunt scene.

06:39.525 --> 06:40.776
Best of British.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.364
And has this Eunice Huthart agreed
to have you work with her?

06:45.948 --> 06:46.865
Uh…

06:47.574 --> 06:49.117
Dear Eunice, um,

06:49.201 --> 06:50.953
just checking you got my last email.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.790
Like I said,
you are literally my favorite stuntwoman.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.793
Like, ever since I saw you backflip
off that helicopter,

06:57.876 --> 07:00.921
I knew the only thing I ever wanted to be
was a stunt--

07:01.004 --> 07:03.465
I'm sure Dr. Gupta would love
to have you work with him at his pharmacy.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.217
No. No. I am not gonna be a doctor.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.135
No way. Forget it.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.512
Do I look like a doctor to you?

07:08.595 --> 07:11.640
Yeah, mate, you do.

07:11.723 --> 07:12.891
That's all.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.520
Orwellian tactics, man.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.898
Yeah, you don't need some piddly career
week bollocks to fulfill your destiny.

07:19.982 --> 07:20.983
Oi!

07:22.067 --> 07:23.485
Stuntwoman.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.905
Show us a stunt, then.

07:26.989 --> 07:27.990
Piss off, Kovacs.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.409
I've had enough of your shite
for one morning.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.160
Minus ten house points.

07:32.661 --> 07:33.954
Insubordination.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.416
You can't minus house points.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.792
Oh,

07:38.876 --> 07:41.295
I think you'll find I can.

07:43.755 --> 07:44.756
Leave it, Ria.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.967
Yeah, come on. Let's go.
It's not worth it.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.636
No.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.601
Let's dance.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.770
-Mmm.
-Suit yourself, then.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.981
Kovacs versus Khan, people!

08:01.064 --> 08:02.858
-Khan versus Kovacs!
-Come on.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.245
Hi-yah!

08:40.770 --> 08:42.648
Damage to school property.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.274
Minus ten house points.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.444
Khan struggles to prove her salt
as a stuntwoman.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.446
-But you've got to admire her tenacity.
-Mmm.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.419
Spence was right.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.921
You should be a doctor.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.591
I'm not a stinking doctor.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.093
Ooh!

09:11.176 --> 09:12.636
Dr. Khan.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.763
It just sounds right.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.433
Yeah, well,
your dad doesn't love you.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.310
-Ooh!
-Yeah, he does.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.857
Ooh, daddy issues.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.779
He just bought me a car!

09:31.405 --> 09:34.116
But you gotta ask yourself,
did he remember your birthday?

09:44.418 --> 09:47.337
Why don't you just give it up, Khan?

09:48.172 --> 09:51.425
You're too feeble
to be a stuntwoman.

09:54.928 --> 09:55.971
I'm not feeble.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.433
I am the fury.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.601
You what, mate?

10:01.727 --> 10:04.438
I am the fury!

10:04.521 --> 10:06.190
The flying reverse spin kick.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.566
Will…

10:09.151 --> 10:09.985

10:12.279 --> 10:13.488

10:14.990 --> 10:16.825
it?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.411
Ooh!

10:21.288 --> 10:23.373
Unlucky.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.463
Ladies, have some decorum, for God's sake.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.259
In my office, Ms. Khan. Now.

-Where's Lena?
-Uh, in her room.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.537
Where are my keys?

11:03.413 --> 11:04.581
Oh. Huh.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.083
What's with the scarfy thing?

11:06.166 --> 11:09.127
Oh, I just thought it'd be
a nice pop of color, but no?

11:09.211 --> 11:10.754
-Don't you think-- Not good?
-No, no.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.382

11:35.362 --> 11:36.947

11:46.415 --> 11:49.084
Salim doesn't like any girl I show him.

11:49.168 --> 11:52.921
-And I show him only the best girls.
-Mmm.

11:53.005 --> 11:54.798
Allah, he's so picky.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.967
He's like, "Ma, I don't like this one."

11:57.050 --> 11:59.386
And I'm like, "Okay, how about this one?"

11:59.469 --> 12:00.804
And he's like, "No."

12:00.888 --> 12:03.557
It's good for the boy to be picky.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.144
Mm-hmm.
He's such a wonderful boy, mashallah.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.520
-Mashallah.
-Mashallah.

12:08.604 --> 12:12.024
He's been working so hard
setting up his new lab.

12:12.107 --> 12:15.694
And I'm like,
Allah, please let him find a nice girl.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.155
-Inshallah, he will.
-Inshallah.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.283
Inshallah.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.995
Fatima, how are the girls?

12:26.496 --> 12:27.497
Uh…

12:30.876 --> 12:34.880
They're fine.
Just-- Just great.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.595
-Three count.
-Yeah.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.055
-Double knee.
-One, two.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.766
Nice. You've really improved
since your last vid. Guard up.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.393

So, when are you thinking
about going back?

13:11.083 --> 13:13.418
Eh, don't wanna talk about it. Double.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.295
I saw Lena yesterday.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.631
I saw her too.
Looking very pale.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.591
Not in a good way, bechari.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.636
Lena? Oh, no. She's fine.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.639
-I heard she dropped out of art school.
-Oh…

13:26.515 --> 13:30.018
No. She's-- She's just taking time out
to weigh up her options.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.104
And what are her options?

13:33.939 --> 13:37.025
She is very pretty at least. Mashallah.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.110
Mashallah.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.778
Mashallah.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.784
Hmm?

13:45.868 --> 13:46.994
Mm-mmm.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.878
You are looking much better,
Lena, jaan.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.130
Thanks, Baba.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.506
I showered.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.466
-Good girl.
-Good girl.

14:05.012 --> 14:09.516
You know, Saclain is looking for
a receptionist for his dentist practice.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.061
-If you wanted to work there--
-Rafe. Are you mad?

14:13.145 --> 14:15.189
-Come on. That is not cool.
-What? What did I do?

14:15.272 --> 14:17.983
She's not gonna be a receptionist.
How would that look?

14:18.066 --> 14:21.403
Uh, she's an artist.
Not a pencil-pounding desk shagger.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.447
-Honestly, receptionist?
-What?

14:24.615 --> 14:26.450
Lena's going back
to art school soon, anyway.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.827
-Aren't you, Lena?
-Uh, no.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.412
Lena was a brave girl.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.373
She realized that art school
was not serious,

14:34.291 --> 14:35.334
so she's come home.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.836
-Mmm.
-It was very brave. Good girl.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.129
Shabash.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.631
No, that's BS.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.549
-Lena, tell them.
-Leave it, Ria.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.344
I'm sorry, okay?

14:45.427 --> 14:48.305
I think we just need to iron out
a couple of things in this household.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.307
Lena is going to be an artist.

14:50.891 --> 14:51.892
And I…

14:53.143 --> 14:54.978
am going to be a stuntwoman.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.563
Ria, not that again. Please, child.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.857
-What?
-Ria, Khuda kay liye.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.193
Can you just stop it
with this stuntwoman crap?

15:01.276 --> 15:05.030
Do you think your father sends you
to that school for you to be a stuntwoman?

15:06.615 --> 15:08.367
-Yes?
-Uh, no.

15:09.535 --> 15:10.994
And I don't wanna hear another peep

15:11.078 --> 15:13.872
about any of this artist "shartist"
stuntwoman crap, okay?

15:15.123 --> 15:17.459
Raheela Auntie has invited us
to her Eid soiree,

15:17.543 --> 15:20.504
and I don't wanna hear any of this
when we're at her place.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.172
How'd you wangle an invite to that?

15:22.256 --> 15:24.716
Aren't we too low-born
for such esteemed company?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.051
-No, no.
-No.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.427
Raheela and I--

15:27.511 --> 15:30.347
We have a lot in common.
We're in the same mah-jongg group.

15:31.265 --> 15:32.432
-We're friends.
-Ah.

15:33.559 --> 15:34.560
Mazel tov.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.938
I'm happy for you, Ma. Really, I am.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.984
But there isn't a chance in France
me or Lena are gonna be caught dead

15:42.067 --> 15:45.195
at some hoity-toity,
pretentious Eid soir--

15:59.168 --> 16:00.878
-Shit.
-Shit.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.005
Shit.

16:03.589 --> 16:04.590
Come on.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.486
Oh, my God!

16:27.196 --> 16:28.363
Fatima!

16:29.031 --> 16:30.032
You came!

16:33.827 --> 16:35.495
Eid Mubarak.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.332
Eid Mubarak, Raheela.
Eid Mubarak.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.502
-Husband.
-Eid Mubarak.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.921
-Girls.
-Eid Mubarak.

16:44.004 --> 16:48.217
Hello. God! Look at you guys.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.551
So slim!

16:51.595 --> 16:54.681
Come. Let me take you to the parlor
where Salim and all the young people are.

16:54.765 --> 16:55.766
Come on!

16:55.849 --> 16:56.934
Salim?

16:57.017 --> 16:59.186
I knock on the door,
and he's sat behind his desk.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.021
He looks me up and down and he goes,

17:01.980 --> 17:04.358
"Is that what you're wearing?"

17:10.489 --> 17:13.325
Can I get anyone a drink?
Does anyone want any more…

17:13.407 --> 17:15.327
Hey. I was still drinking that.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.371
He's not a banker, so he's not evil.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.457
But he's still got shitloads of money,
so I totally would.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.251
He's fitter than God.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.544
You reckon God's fit?

17:23.627 --> 17:26.630
I always imagined
this, like, old, beardy, fat guy.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.715
Get this, he's a doctor.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.384
Doctor.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.635
A geneticist.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.805
Saving babies and shit. Making sure
their chromosomes aren't wonky.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.641
Apparently, he's looking to settle.
Get his wife on, as they say.

17:39.601 --> 17:44.565
Look at them. Parading themselves around
for some wife-hungry, womanizing skeeze.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.067
I'd let him womanize me
any day of the week.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.779
That was-- That was so funny.

17:52.406 --> 17:53.782
What a prick.

17:54.283 --> 17:56.118
I hear he's actually quite nice.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.829
Biscuits are nice.

18:00.831 --> 18:03.292
Allow this. I'm gonna explore.

18:17.890 --> 18:18.891
Geek.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.114
-Salim.
-Hmm?

18:34.198 --> 18:36.366
Come here, bachcha. Come here.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.703
-Yeah.
-What?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.872
-Is something there?
-It's nothing.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.540
Mm-hmm.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.002
There you go.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.921
You look so handsome.

19:30.462 --> 19:31.463
What?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.512
Lena.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.056
What the…

19:44.059 --> 19:45.644
Jezah. Jezah.

19:46.812 --> 19:49.231
Something isn't right here.
Where's Lena?

19:49.314 --> 19:51.483
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.151
Oh, my God. You know?

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
Golden boy wants a bad girl.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.405
Typical.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.949
That's why we were invited.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.785
Obvi. He sampled
what the community has to offer.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.078
Hello.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.288
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.499
Apparently, art school dropout
is his flavor of choice--

20:07.583 --> 20:08.584
Dick.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.477
He's such a lovely boy.
I know you'll like him.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.604
Mom, please.

20:28.687 --> 20:31.315
It's just a casual hangout.
You need to stop with all this.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.150
This is unsafe, Lena. It's a trap.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.403
Oh, my God, Ria. Chill out.
It is just a bit of fun.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.946
Yeah, Ria. Chill out.

20:38.030 --> 20:40.574
He's looking for a wife.
Like, actively seeking.

20:40.657 --> 20:41.867
So sweet.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.911
Uh, no. Not sweet. Evil.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.205
-He's got an enormous wedding boner.
-Oi!

20:46.288 --> 20:47.915
Cool.
I'll take the piss out of him for it.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.458
No, you cannot. I forbid you.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.294
Okay, guys,
we need to take a breather here.

20:52.377 --> 20:55.088
I'm a dropout.
I'm hardly prime wedding material.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.007
True. That is true.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.217
No. No, no, no.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.303
You're-- You're pretty, you're thin,
you're charming.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.514
Not like that Seema's daughter
with her giant ankles.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.766
-Ma, that is not okay.
-Ma, not cool. That's harsh.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.059
Why? Why?

21:08.227 --> 21:10.187
Why are you wearing a cardigan?
You don't wear cardigans.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.688
Ria, shut up.

21:11.772 --> 21:12.814
Beti, you look lovely.

21:13.398 --> 21:16.401
Fine. Shag him, then cut him loose.
Clean and simple.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.654
-What is wrong with you?
-Ow!

21:24.910 --> 21:26.828
♪ Now this is for my gangsters ♪

21:27.996 --> 21:29.998
♪ And this is for my thugs ♪

21:31.500 --> 21:33.627
♪ And this is for my sisters ♪

21:35.087 --> 21:37.130
♪ I know you need some love ♪

21:38.257 --> 21:39.258
♪ Hmm ♪

21:39.341 --> 21:42.678
♪ I laugh in the faces
Of all these people dismissing me ♪

21:42.761 --> 21:45.430
♪ Every day in my DMs
I know that you really-- ♪

21:45.514 --> 21:46.807
Don't even think about it.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.232
So do you do this often then?

21:56.108 --> 21:57.234
Do what?

21:58.485 --> 21:59.820
Dates with random women.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.531
Well, not random women.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.409
Oh, no.
Mother-approved women, of course.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.245
God, do I seem like that much
of a whipped mummy's boy to you?

22:09.746 --> 22:10.956
-Don't answer that.
-Okay.

22:15.043 --> 22:18.589
Is she, um-- Is she really busting
your balls to settle down then?

22:18.672 --> 22:23.844
Well, I mean, like, the normal amount
for a Pakistani mother with an only son.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.762
-So a lot?
-Yeah, a lot.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.514
Oh, no.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.101
-You picked the art in the house?
-Yeah.

22:31.185 --> 22:34.479
-Do you know it's terrible? It's--
-It's not-- Oh, my God.

22:42.821 --> 22:43.822
So,

22:44.531 --> 22:45.782
what do you do?

22:48.660 --> 22:49.786
Um…

22:50.412 --> 22:51.413
I--

22:52.706 --> 22:57.044
-I used to go to art school.
-Mm-hmm.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.130
But, um,

23:01.006 --> 23:02.382
not anymore.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.801
Um…

23:06.011 --> 23:08.055
Yeah, it didn't really work out.

23:08.555 --> 23:13.519
So, to answer your question,
what do I do, uh,

23:14.353 --> 23:16.063
I-- I disappoint my parents.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.648
That's what I do.

23:20.484 --> 23:21.485
LOL.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.571
You know, um…

23:26.657 --> 23:31.245
I feel like there's this huge pressure
these days to, like, do a thing.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.957
You know, the thing we do
that's supposed to define us.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.294
I think it's really great
to just allow yourself to be,

23:39.378 --> 23:41.713
you know, working it out.

23:43.757 --> 23:44.925
Yeah?

23:46.134 --> 23:47.135
Yeah.

23:47.761 --> 23:50.222
You know, my sensei told me
my kicks are getting better, Ma.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.807
Mmm. Okay.

23:52.808 --> 23:55.602
-Laters.
-Have fun, darling.

23:55.686 --> 23:59.398
Oh, come on.
Really, Lena?

23:59.481 --> 24:01.316
You're not seeing him again, are you?

24:02.776 --> 24:05.112
At least take off that bastard cardigan!

24:05.195 --> 24:06.363
-Oi!
-Ow.

24:11.243 --> 24:12.244
Come on.

24:14.204 --> 24:17.124
She's seeing him, like, every other day.
She's not doing her art.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.209
-She's wearing cardigans.
-Rough.

24:19.293 --> 24:21.837
She's meant to be on her path
to becoming a great artist.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.214
Just relax, man.
This is all normal.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.591
She's in her second act.

24:25.674 --> 24:26.675
What?

24:26.758 --> 24:29.469
Act one, Lena splashes
onto the art school scene,

24:29.553 --> 24:31.471
a spicy ingenue
with a killer brushstroke.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.849
Act two, even with all
the talent in the world,

24:33.932 --> 24:36.310
she's hit with-- Boom! Crisis.

24:36.393 --> 24:37.561
Crisis!

24:37.644 --> 24:39.021
She thinks she's shite.

24:39.104 --> 24:41.940
Confidence depleted,
where does she find herself?

24:42.024 --> 24:43.483
-At a low point.
-A trough.

24:43.567 --> 24:44.693
Rock effing bottom.

24:44.776 --> 24:48.280
Seeking temporary solace
in the firm bosom of a fit guy.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.490
Will she ever return to her art?

24:50.574 --> 24:53.285
Uh, act three.
Yeah, she bloody does.

24:54.870 --> 24:55.871
Hey, Li.

24:56.455 --> 24:57.915
Wanna help me with a vid?

24:57.998 --> 24:59.458
Sorry, Ri Ri, I can't.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.834
What?

25:02.127 --> 25:03.128
Wait, Li.

25:04.963 --> 25:07.466
Maybe when I'm back.
Get out of my room.

25:21.688 --> 25:22.731
Fight.

25:23.649 --> 25:24.650
Set.

25:42.376 --> 25:45.420
Dear Eunice, sorry to email again.

25:45.504 --> 25:49.299
I know you must be super busy
working on a Marvel or a Star War,

25:49.383 --> 25:51.718
so don't worry about not responding.

25:52.302 --> 25:53.303
Stay loose.

25:58.058 --> 26:01.103
I'm still doing my fight videos
and training every week.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.188
Hi-yah!

26:04.815 --> 26:07.401
I've almost mastered
your flying reverse spin kick.

26:09.820 --> 26:10.988
Almost.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.907
Well, my sister thinks I'm getting better,
and she would know.

26:13.991 --> 26:15.576
She watches all my vids.

26:22.416 --> 26:27.045
She's been seeing this guy
who I think is a bit of a smarmy wanker.

26:27.129 --> 26:28.589
Excuse my French.

26:28.672 --> 26:32.384
I mean, what is it with men? Am I right?

26:32.467 --> 26:36.180
I'm no expert,
but they just seem to destroy things.

26:36.847 --> 26:41.852
-The economy, the ozone, the rain forests.
-Keep going.

26:42.603 --> 26:44.897
I just… I don't know.

26:44.980 --> 26:48.317
It's like the whole universe
revolves around them,

26:48.400 --> 26:49.818
bending to their will.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.028
Ooh!

26:51.778 --> 26:54.656
Maybe it's time
the universe bends to someone else.

26:56.116 --> 27:02.414
If you're ever free for a coffee
or, like, an informal chat, I'd love that.

27:02.497 --> 27:05.125
Warm regards, Ria Khan.

27:26.563 --> 27:28.023
Unless she'll be in charge.

27:28.106 --> 27:30.317
Lena. Lena.

27:31.985 --> 27:33.153
What's going on?

27:33.237 --> 27:36.073
Ria, come. Say your salaams.

27:36.156 --> 27:37.157
Ria, come in. Hmm.

27:38.325 --> 27:41.495
Hi, Ria. How was school?

28:08.897 --> 28:09.898
Ria?

28:10.524 --> 28:11.525
Ria.

28:13.485 --> 28:14.486
Ria.

28:25.038 --> 28:27.708
This is Salim Shah.

28:27.791 --> 28:32.004
He's 32, big shot, geneticist,
setting up some fancy new lab.

28:32.087 --> 28:36.008
He's also the mastermind
behind derailing Lena's future.

28:36.091 --> 28:38.468
The lecherous, loathsome cad.

28:38.552 --> 28:39.720
The poo-face.

28:41.388 --> 28:42.389
Sisters,

28:42.472 --> 28:45.642
this is more than just act two wobbles.

28:45.726 --> 28:49.730
Lena has been brainwashed
by this wife-hunting maniac

28:49.813 --> 28:52.191
who's chosen her to be his trophy bride.

28:52.274 --> 28:55.986
And she is too sad and mind-shat
to see what is going on.

28:56.069 --> 29:00.532
So that leaves it to us
to break off this sham wedding.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.160
Who's with me?

29:04.244 --> 29:05.913
Down with the patriarchy!

29:05.996 --> 29:08.248
Let's decimate this mother!

29:08.332 --> 29:11.126
Huzzah!

29:11.210 --> 29:14.880
Huzzah!

29:16.173 --> 29:17.591
Cool, so what's the plan?

29:18.717 --> 29:20.052
Phase one.

29:27.017 --> 29:28.352
Diplomacy.

29:31.313 --> 29:32.564
Diplomacy.

29:33.524 --> 29:34.525
So, like,

29:35.108 --> 29:36.193
chatting?

29:36.276 --> 29:39.571
Yeah, like, verbiage.
Strongly worded verbiage.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.074
Cease and desist, etcetera, etcetera.

29:45.786 --> 29:47.454
Diplomacy!

29:47.538 --> 29:51.416
Diplomacy!

29:57.297 --> 30:01.009
This is uncool, Ba. Highly uncool.

30:01.093 --> 30:03.637
Lena is not in her right mind.

30:03.720 --> 30:07.140
Ria, it's hard for you girls
to find a suitable match these days

30:07.224 --> 30:08.976
because you're operating
in a free market.

30:09.726 --> 30:12.938
And you shouldn't see it like, "Oh, no.
Lena's got an arranged marriage." No.

30:13.021 --> 30:16.775
You should see it like Lena has outsourced
the search for a suitable match to us,

30:16.859 --> 30:20.320
so that we then carry out
the necessary due diligence,

30:20.404 --> 30:25.659
saving her from investing
any unnecessary emotional capital

30:25.742 --> 30:28.287
whilst providing her with a maximum yield.

30:31.582 --> 30:32.583
What?

30:32.666 --> 30:35.669
Listen, I'm not some kind of big villain,
okay?

30:35.752 --> 30:37.546
I let her go to art school, didn't I?

30:37.629 --> 30:39.339
That's more than
any of the other mothers.

30:39.423 --> 30:41.300
Do you know how much shit
I got for that?

30:41.383 --> 30:43.010
No. He is good for her.

30:43.093 --> 30:44.636
With all due respect, Ma,

30:44.720 --> 30:46.972
that is a load of balls.

30:47.055 --> 30:48.807
Ria, you're being dramatic.

30:48.891 --> 30:52.269
I'm being dramatic?
I'm being dramatic?

30:52.352 --> 30:53.187
Yeah.

30:53.270 --> 30:55.314
You've been seeing this guy
for not even a month,

30:55.397 --> 30:57.191
-and you're marrying him.
-I know.

30:57.274 --> 30:59.526
That's dramatic. You're being dramatic.

30:59.610 --> 31:02.946
Yeah, well, he needs to get married
before the move to Singapore.

31:06.867 --> 31:09.036
Singapore? You're moving to Singapore?

31:11.580 --> 31:12.748
Yeah, well.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.125
Beats being here.

31:18.295 --> 31:21.256
Wow. So you're doing
a Jane Austen then.

31:22.216 --> 31:24.176
-Nice.
-I'm not doing a Jane Austen.

31:24.259 --> 31:27.721
Well, throwing your life away
to marry some rich Mr. Darcy wanker

31:27.804 --> 31:30.098
sounds pretty 1800s retro, if you ask me.

31:30.766 --> 31:31.767
Hmm.

31:33.393 --> 31:37.022
If you can't support me,
then you need to stay out of my life.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.607
-Lena.
-Get out.

31:42.861 --> 31:46.949
I knew diplomacy wasn't gonna work.
When has it ever worked?

31:47.032 --> 31:49.368
Yeah. Humanity's pretty basic.

31:50.285 --> 31:51.453
Phase two.

31:58.168 --> 31:59.920
We need to find some dirt on Salim.

32:00.003 --> 32:02.214
That should be easy.
Pretty little rich boy.

32:02.297 --> 32:04.633
Give me 20 minutes with his laptop,
and I'll nail him.

32:04.716 --> 32:06.009
-Easy.
-Nice.

32:06.093 --> 32:07.928
How are we gonna get his laptop?

32:08.011 --> 32:11.557
He goes to the gym every day after work
before he picks up Lena.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.017
All right.
So we break into his gym locker,

32:14.101 --> 32:17.312
steal his lappy, download everything
and whistleblow this bitch.

32:17.396 --> 32:19.690
We'll need to get
into the changing room.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.692
The men's changing room.

32:21.775 --> 32:22.943
We'll need disguises.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.494
How do I look?

32:33.412 --> 32:34.538
Yeah.

32:34.621 --> 32:35.831
Good.

32:35.914 --> 32:37.165
Virile.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.751
-Sal, how you doing?
-Hey. How are you?

32:39.835 --> 32:41.545
The eagle has landed.

32:41.628 --> 32:44.715
I repeat. The eagle has landed.

32:50.554 --> 32:55.601
Just remember, back straight, tits in,
and swagger-- Two, three, four.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.438
Whoa. Sorry.

33:39.144 --> 33:40.187
Bingo.

33:42.898 --> 33:45.692
The eagle is on the treadmill.

33:45.776 --> 33:49.029
I repeat. The eagle is on the treadmill.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.491
You don't have to repeat
everything, numbnuts.

33:52.574 --> 33:54.993
Copy that, ball bag.

34:20.561 --> 34:21.853
Okay, people.

34:21.937 --> 34:23.647
Target is in sight.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.525
Remember, time is money.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.491
-Hurry!
-All right.

34:34.574 --> 34:36.869
Here we go.

34:39.288 --> 34:41.581
-Five minutes.
-Wait.

34:41.665 --> 34:42.916
Wait a minute.

34:45.918 --> 34:46.962
He's on the move.

35:03.061 --> 35:04.521
-Bollocks.
-What?

35:04.605 --> 35:05.564
Thirty minutes.

35:05.647 --> 35:07.983
Thirty minutes? What do you mean?

35:08.066 --> 35:09.401
I mean what I said.

35:09.484 --> 35:10.986
I thought you were the techy one.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.321
I am the techy one.

35:12.404 --> 35:14.698
Well, live by the sword,
die by the sword.

35:14.781 --> 35:16.700
Ria, are you hearing this? Ria?

35:16.783 --> 35:19.828
Ria, it's gonna be at least 30 minutes.

35:19.912 --> 35:21.830
Repeat. Thirty minutes.

35:22.664 --> 35:24.333
He's heading back
to the changing rooms.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.710
We need to abort mission.

35:26.793 --> 35:29.463
-No. No. No.
-Abort. Abort.

35:30.047 --> 35:31.340
Abort!

35:32.049 --> 35:33.717
No. Keep going.

35:39.598 --> 35:40.516
Salim.

35:51.818 --> 35:54.530
-Do you come here a lot?
-Oh, no, I just, uh--

35:56.240 --> 35:57.950
They have a great…

35:58.867 --> 36:00.327
Zumba class.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.913
Love me some Zumba.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.414
Sounds like a great class.

36:15.717 --> 36:20.389
Naima, Amina, Seema, Rubina.

36:20.472 --> 36:24.059
You've been through quite the collection
of women to get to Lena.

36:24.142 --> 36:25.686
Yeah, I-- I know how it looks.

36:25.769 --> 36:29.189
Basically, my mum set up all these
weird dates, so I had to meet them.

36:29.273 --> 36:31.108
It would've been rude not to,
you know?

36:31.191 --> 36:32.568
You do everything your mum says?

36:35.404 --> 36:37.406
Well, she's sacrificed a lot for me,

36:37.489 --> 36:39.491
so I try to make her happy where I can.

36:39.575 --> 36:40.576
But, um…

36:42.160 --> 36:43.871
But, look, Ria.

36:43.954 --> 36:45.622
I know it's gotta be hard for you.

36:46.290 --> 36:48.876
I know that you and Lena
are super close. I just--

36:49.751 --> 36:51.170
I want you to know,

36:52.296 --> 36:53.714
I really love your sister.

36:57.801 --> 36:59.386
All right, then.

36:59.469 --> 37:01.054
What are her best qualities?

37:04.975 --> 37:06.143
Oh, you're serious. Okay.

37:06.226 --> 37:09.062
Um, she's kind,

37:09.646 --> 37:11.148
generous.

37:11.231 --> 37:12.232
Just a really thoughtful--

37:12.316 --> 37:13.567
Download complete.

37:14.568 --> 37:15.569
Hurry.

37:18.780 --> 37:21.491
Alba, just remember,
his locker is number 14.

37:21.575 --> 37:24.203
Just try to blend in.

37:29.208 --> 37:31.585
Heavenly Father, give me strength.

37:47.768 --> 37:48.769
Done.

37:51.772 --> 37:52.773
Good day to you.

37:54.024 --> 37:55.150
Good day.

38:00.948 --> 38:01.990
Ria?

38:04.868 --> 38:05.869
Ria.

38:09.498 --> 38:10.499
Ria!

38:16.964 --> 38:18.966
Lena.

38:20.259 --> 38:22.594
So, you bumped into him
at the gym, huh?

38:22.678 --> 38:23.720
Really?

38:26.348 --> 38:28.684
No. I followed his movements
and tracked him down.

38:28.767 --> 38:29.893
I wanted to meet him.

38:29.977 --> 38:32.312
Seeing as he's
my soon-to-be brother-in-law.

38:34.481 --> 38:37.776
What did I tell you
about staying out of my life?

38:41.613 --> 38:42.656
Oops.

39:03.594 --> 39:04.595
No, wait, Li!

39:05.387 --> 39:10.434
I told you to piss off!

39:17.316 --> 39:19.484
I'm not gonna let you
throw your life away.

39:35.751 --> 39:38.003
He says he loves you,
and he doesn't even know you.

39:49.431 --> 39:51.266
He thinks you're kind.

39:58.649 --> 39:59.733
I am kind.

40:01.610 --> 40:03.695
No, you're not. You're arrogant.

40:06.114 --> 40:07.115
You're egotistical.

40:11.078 --> 40:12.412
You're an artist.

40:15.332 --> 40:18.418
The sooner you get out of
this Stepford wife, cardigan phase,

40:18.502 --> 40:20.420
the better for everyone!

40:24.967 --> 40:26.677
That was the phase, Ria!

40:28.345 --> 40:29.763
This is me.

40:32.683 --> 40:34.268
-This is me!
-Bullshit!

40:34.351 --> 40:36.728
The Lena that I know
would never give up on her art.

40:36.812 --> 40:38.355
Well, boo-hoo, she did.

40:38.438 --> 40:40.899
-Why?
-Because I'm not good enough!

40:43.777 --> 40:45.988
Happy?

40:46.905 --> 40:48.031
Is that what you want?

40:51.618 --> 40:53.495
-Because I'm not good enough.
-Lena.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.168
Girls, I don't care who started it.

40:59.251 --> 41:01.503
Just clean it up and get down here.

41:02.880 --> 41:03.922
Coming, Ma!

41:18.729 --> 41:19.730
Come on. Come on.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.982
There must be something.
There has got to be something.

41:22.065 --> 41:23.275
Nothing dodgy, man.

41:23.358 --> 41:26.320
As far as I understand, he's doing
really good work helping out sick babies.

41:26.403 --> 41:30.699
Yeah. Consultations,
a lot of pro boner stuff.

41:30.782 --> 41:32.242
Pro bono.

41:32.326 --> 41:33.160
Yeah.

41:34.203 --> 41:36.205
You said "pro boner." It's "pro bono."

41:37.039 --> 41:38.165
Well, whatever it is,

41:38.957 --> 41:41.793
your man, Salim,
is one sexy mensch.

41:50.219 --> 41:52.471
Okay.

41:52.554 --> 41:54.973
So we haven't found any dirt on our man,

41:56.058 --> 41:57.851
but we're gonna plant some.

41:59.144 --> 42:01.146
Um, Ria,

42:01.730 --> 42:05.359
do you think this is something
that Lena actually, you know, wants?

42:05.859 --> 42:08.278
-What? No, no. No, no--
-Ria, think about it.

42:08.362 --> 42:09.488
I mean, he's buff.

42:09.571 --> 42:10.822
He's saving babies.

42:10.906 --> 42:13.116
Ria, he's taking her off
to a tropical island.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.827
I mean, maybe you're just--
I don't know.

42:15.911 --> 42:17.829
-A bit jealous.
-Jealous?

42:17.913 --> 42:20.332
Okay. Piss off, okay?
How could I be jealous?

42:20.415 --> 42:23.168
She's got a tropical island and a fit guy.
What have you got?

42:23.252 --> 42:25.420
Hormonal acne
and geography coursework.

42:25.504 --> 42:27.422
You think I want a fit guy?

42:28.882 --> 42:31.927
Ha! Okay, I am going
to be a stuntwoman,

42:32.010 --> 42:34.221
and Lena is gonna be a great artist,

42:34.304 --> 42:36.348
and nothing is going to stop us.

42:36.431 --> 42:39.476
Especially not some pretty boy
with nice teeth!

42:39.560 --> 42:40.769
Do you hear me?

42:42.938 --> 42:46.441
Whoo!
Maybe we should take five. Get some air.

42:46.525 --> 42:48.902
Maybe you should just, like, fuck off.

42:50.279 --> 42:51.321
-What?
-Excuse you?

42:52.406 --> 42:54.616
Well, if you're not gonna help,
you can do one.

42:55.868 --> 42:58.328
Wow.
So, that's the thanks we get?

42:58.412 --> 42:59.580
Charming.

43:01.164 --> 43:02.249
Come on, Alba.

44:08.148 --> 44:09.775
…matriarch mother,

44:09.858 --> 44:13.153
who is often the oldest
and largest female…

44:13.237 --> 44:14.613
Grim.

44:38.178 --> 44:39.471
…animals in the wild…

44:39.555 --> 44:40.556
Ummi?

44:41.056 --> 44:43.016
Quiet, baby.

45:22.848 --> 45:25.184
Yes.

45:35.736 --> 45:36.737
Ria?

45:39.114 --> 45:40.324
Are you-- Are you--

45:40.407 --> 45:41.825
Are you mad?

45:41.909 --> 45:44.203
Are you an insane person? Huh?

45:44.828 --> 45:46.914
Speak! Why would you--

45:46.997 --> 45:49.166
You were planting used condoms?

45:51.251 --> 45:53.921
-You're disgusting, Ria.
-No. I know. I know, I know.

45:54.004 --> 45:55.589
But lis-- listen. Lis--

45:55.672 --> 45:57.382
Look. Look what I found!

45:58.091 --> 45:59.301
Look!

45:59.384 --> 46:01.845
Have you got another wife
you wanna tell us about, Salim, huh?

46:01.929 --> 46:03.013
-What?
-Ria.

46:03.096 --> 46:04.932
Maybe you're just hoarding wives
in Singapore.

46:05.015 --> 46:08.060
You've probably got a whole harem
of women, like wives in different ports.

46:08.143 --> 46:09.770
Hos in different area codes.

46:09.853 --> 46:12.731
Lena. Lena, he's dangerous.
I told you. I told you!

46:12.814 --> 46:14.274
Ria! Enough.

46:15.817 --> 46:16.902
It's Huda.

46:20.322 --> 46:21.698
Oh.

46:21.782 --> 46:23.992
"Oh." That's all you're gonna say?

46:26.078 --> 46:28.080
Wait, you know about her?

46:30.749 --> 46:32.376
This is Huda,

46:33.168 --> 46:34.837
my last wife. She--

46:36.255 --> 46:37.256
She passed away.

46:38.799 --> 46:39.800
What?

46:40.592 --> 46:42.135
When she was going into labor,

46:43.095 --> 46:44.388
she had a heart attack,

46:44.471 --> 46:46.974
but the doctors didn't know what it was.

46:47.057 --> 46:48.308
It wasn't the usual signs.

46:51.687 --> 46:53.146
I'm sorry.

46:54.439 --> 46:57.568
At my new lab, we're gonna focus
on women's symptoms

46:57.651 --> 46:59.444
so things like this don't happen.

47:06.201 --> 47:08.912
-I-- I didn't know.
-Of course you didn't know.

47:10.372 --> 47:13.041
You're just running around
in your little fantasyland,

47:13.125 --> 47:16.378
making up stupid stories,
doing your stupid little stunts,

47:16.461 --> 47:18.255
and I'm sick of it, Ria.

47:19.464 --> 47:20.591
I just-- I--

47:22.050 --> 47:24.052
I want you-- I want you to be an artist.

47:24.136 --> 47:26.847
For Christ's sake, I am not an artist!

47:28.056 --> 47:30.058
And you are not a stuntwoman.

47:35.355 --> 47:37.524
-Baby.
-No.

47:38.275 --> 47:39.902
I-- I'm so done with this.

47:40.611 --> 47:42.696
Okay, now you listen to me.

47:42.779 --> 47:46.742
When we get home, you are going to go
to your room and stay in your room.

47:46.825 --> 47:49.161
No Internet, no gadgets,
no phones, no nothing.

47:49.244 --> 47:52.331
You go to school, you come home.
You go to your room, stay in your room.

47:52.414 --> 47:53.832
Do you understand this?

47:56.502 --> 47:58.045
Are you ready?

47:58.295 --> 47:59.713
One.

48:00.255 --> 48:01.590
Two.

48:02.132 --> 48:04.009
-Three.
-Dear Eunice…

48:04.092 --> 48:06.303
Four. Five.

48:06.386 --> 48:08.347
…don't worry about not responding.

48:09.515 --> 48:13.602
I just thought I'd let you know
I've given up on being a stuntwoman.

48:20.442 --> 48:23.403
Oi, Billy No-Mates.

48:24.488 --> 48:26.156
What about a rematch, stunty?

48:27.324 --> 48:29.409
Thought you'd miss
my foot up your arse.

48:30.244 --> 48:32.246
No. You were right.

48:36.291 --> 48:39.586
My parents say
I've got an overactive imagination

48:39.670 --> 48:41.922
and that I should concentrate
on my studies.

48:42.881 --> 48:44.508
But I just wanted to let you know

48:45.592 --> 48:47.302
you'll always be my favorite.

48:50.180 --> 48:52.724
I think I've really messed things up
with my sister.

48:54.059 --> 48:55.936
She's not talking to me anymore.

48:57.896 --> 49:00.023
What if she never talks to me again?

49:29.803 --> 49:30.971
Morning.

49:31.805 --> 49:33.640
How much did we drink last night?

49:34.975 --> 49:36.685
Oh, my God!

49:37.895 --> 49:39.688
-No, no, no. I--
-What's wrong?

49:41.273 --> 49:42.774
I'm really sorry.

49:43.650 --> 49:44.818
What? Why?

49:44.902 --> 49:47.070
I just "perioded" all over your sheets.

49:50.199 --> 49:52.534
No, I just-- I thought
something was actually wrong.

49:52.618 --> 49:55.454
No, you--
You don't understand. It's, like--

49:55.537 --> 49:57.831
It-- It's really bad.
I have a very heavy flow.

49:57.915 --> 49:59.666
It's, like, biblical.

49:59.750 --> 50:01.668
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine. It's fine.

50:01.752 --> 50:04.004
Just wait there.
I think my mum's got some bits.

50:12.137 --> 50:13.514
Oh, my-- Oh, no.

50:19.228 --> 50:20.812
Ria's quite the rebel, huh?

50:21.605 --> 50:23.982
Um, yeah, she's--

50:24.066 --> 50:26.985
She's, um, really sorry
for what she did.

50:27.528 --> 50:30.405
She gets these stories in her head.

50:30.489 --> 50:32.366
It's sweet
how much she cares about you.

50:32.449 --> 50:34.409
A little bit terrifying, but sweet.

50:34.493 --> 50:35.744
Yeah. Yeah.

50:36.411 --> 50:39.456
So, I'm really excited
for the fittings today.

50:39.540 --> 50:40.874
Ah.

50:40.958 --> 50:41.959
Yes.

50:42.042 --> 50:43.877
It'll be a long day,

50:43.961 --> 50:46.547
so make sure to take some of these.

50:49.633 --> 50:50.634
Iron?

50:51.552 --> 50:54.763
Yes. Your period is heavy.
You lost a lot of blood.

50:54.847 --> 50:56.473
Mum, seriously?

50:56.557 --> 50:57.558
You told her?

50:57.641 --> 51:00.269
A heavy flow is a blessing.
It means your womb is strong.

51:00.352 --> 51:02.855
Oh, my God. Mum, can you stop?

51:02.938 --> 51:04.982
Salim, we women
shouldn't have to hide our bodies.

51:05.065 --> 51:06.066
I know.

51:06.149 --> 51:08.360
Not everyone is comfortable
talking about it at breakfast.

51:08.443 --> 51:10.821
No, it's fine. It's fine.

51:11.905 --> 51:13.240
Thank you.

51:13.323 --> 51:14.658
Thank you for saying that.

51:16.034 --> 51:17.536
And for being so open.

51:18.412 --> 51:19.663
You can tell me anything.

51:35.012 --> 51:36.388
She will forgive you, Ri.

51:37.014 --> 51:38.056
Just give her time.

51:40.726 --> 51:42.728
When you love someone so much,

51:44.438 --> 51:45.689
it's hard to let them go.

51:47.107 --> 51:48.108
Yeah.

51:52.779 --> 51:55.199
Now, you know
what you have to do.

52:14.510 --> 52:17.262
Uh, assalamu alaikum,
Auntie Raheela.

52:17.846 --> 52:21.517
I-- I just wanted to apologize
for breaking into your home,

52:22.059 --> 52:24.228
trying to frame your son,

52:24.853 --> 52:26.438
accusing him of philandering,

52:27.439 --> 52:29.775
uh, generally uncool behavior. Um…

52:31.568 --> 52:32.778
I'm sorry.

52:32.861 --> 52:34.404
Uh, I'm really sorry.

52:36.532 --> 52:38.784
Ria, stop with all that. Come on in.

52:39.368 --> 52:41.620
You know what you need
when you're feeling down?

52:42.204 --> 52:44.706
Cuticle care. I'm having a spa day.

52:44.790 --> 52:46.166
-Come on in.
-Whoa!

52:52.130 --> 52:53.507
Mmm.

52:55.384 --> 52:58.136
Don't you love getting pampered?

52:58.971 --> 53:00.180
Mmm.

53:01.014 --> 53:05.269
We women need to be pampered regularly
to keep us on an even keel, you know?

53:06.520 --> 53:07.938
Yeah.

53:08.021 --> 53:09.439
Sure.

53:09.523 --> 53:11.817
Gotta keep those cuticles in check.

53:12.317 --> 53:13.235
Show me.

53:19.283 --> 53:20.742
Wonderful.

53:22.703 --> 53:24.037
It's time for waxing.

53:24.121 --> 53:25.247
-Come on.
-Waxing?

53:25.330 --> 53:30.127
Um, I think I'll just shave or whatever,
um, for the wedding.

53:31.545 --> 53:32.880
Shave?

53:32.963 --> 53:34.298
Never shave.

53:34.381 --> 53:37.217
Your hair will grow back
twice as thick if you shave.

53:37.301 --> 53:38.510
Come on. Let's go.

53:41.013 --> 53:41.847
Oh.

53:59.448 --> 54:02.159
I think it might be good
if you and I had a little talk.

54:02.242 --> 54:04.995
Um, uh-- Sure. Maybe after this?

54:07.915 --> 54:08.916
No.

54:08.999 --> 54:10.751
I think now is a good time.

54:12.961 --> 54:14.838
It's really hot. It's too hot.

54:16.131 --> 54:18.550
No, no, no! Please. Please.

54:19.259 --> 54:22.804
You don't want this wedding to go ahead,
and you are trying to stop it.

54:23.680 --> 54:27.017
If you think you can bullshit me,
you better think again.

54:27.726 --> 54:29.520
No one bullshits me.

54:32.189 --> 54:34.733
You could never know
what I gave up for that boy.

54:35.317 --> 54:38.362
What I did to shape and fashion him.

54:39.029 --> 54:42.908
Behind every great man,
there's a very tired mother

54:43.951 --> 54:47.412
who has sacrificed everything
for her beautiful boy.

54:47.996 --> 54:50.332
Well, if you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

54:54.795 --> 54:56.839
Lena wouldn't have been my first choice,

54:56.922 --> 54:59.007
but Salim thinks she's the perfect one.

54:59.091 --> 55:00.092
So what can I say?

55:00.175 --> 55:02.094
No chance. She's an artist.

55:02.886 --> 55:04.930
Bitch!

55:08.851 --> 55:12.312
Ria, darling,
this wedding is going to happen.

55:12.396 --> 55:14.064
And as Allah is my witness,

55:14.147 --> 55:18.026
I will strike down you or anyone else
who tries to get in my way.

55:18.986 --> 55:20.988
How about the bikini area?

55:22.197 --> 55:23.365
No, no, no. Please.

55:30.455 --> 55:31.456
Get her!

56:21.632 --> 56:23.467
Ria.

56:24.384 --> 56:26.762
Ria.

56:27.971 --> 56:30.474
Where are you, Ria?

56:31.725 --> 56:33.852
Ria. Ria.

58:42.064 --> 58:43.398
What?

59:00.290 --> 59:01.583
No, no.

59:01.667 --> 59:04.044
Ria? Oh, Ria.

59:05.420 --> 59:06.839
Where are you, darling?

59:07.840 --> 59:10.092
You didn't finish your treatment.

59:10.676 --> 59:12.386
You're uneven.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.484
Khuda hafiz, meri jaan!

59:31.405 --> 59:33.031
Okay,
but I understand you like that,

59:33.115 --> 59:34.992
-but the choice is red or blue.
-Yeah.

59:36.743 --> 59:39.288
What--

59:42.249 --> 59:43.584
Ria, what's going on?

59:43.667 --> 59:44.668
What happened?

59:44.751 --> 59:47.171
Raheela Auntie called.
Said you were behaving strangely.

59:47.254 --> 59:48.338
What?

59:48.422 --> 59:49.423
What have you done?

59:50.799 --> 59:53.385
Uh, no, no. I'm fine.

59:54.511 --> 59:55.888
I had a great time.

59:57.389 --> 59:59.766
She-- She's really nice.

01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:03.854
I said sorry, and--
and she seemed really cool, so…

01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:07.566
We got manicures.

01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:09.526
I went for red.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:10.652
Well, show me.

01:00:14.615 --> 01:00:15.866
Is that Sexy Minx?

01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:17.868
No, no.

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:19.328
It's Orgasmatron.

01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:21.330
Nice.

01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:26.001
Uh, Ma, can I have a word?

01:00:27.377 --> 01:00:28.670
In private.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.137
Mama. Ma, Ma, Ma.

01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:40.098
You cannot let Lena marry Salim.
You cannot. You cannot.

01:00:40.182 --> 01:00:41.892
-Please. Okay? You cannot.
-Ria, enough.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.270
No. He's got a secret lab,
and he's doing secret tests on her,

01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:48.649
and he's gonna inseminate her
with this weird hybrid alien or something.

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:50.817
Ria, stop it. Stop it.

01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:53.028
This is not funny. It's not funny.

01:00:53.111 --> 01:00:55.155
You've-- You upset your sister enough--

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:56.782
Ma, I'm being serious.

01:00:56.865 --> 01:00:59.451
-Can't you just be happy for her?
-No, no, listen! Okay, listen.

01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:02.371
We have to stop this now, please. Okay?

01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:04.164
Maybe Raheela is right.

01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.916
What-- Right about what?

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:09.336
It's not unusual for adolescents to have--

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.506
to have episodes when they
experience unexpected change.

01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:14.675
No, no. What? No. Ma, I'm fine.

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:16.343
She suggested a retreat.

01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:18.136
A retreat?

01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:20.806
For kids who are struggling to adjust.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:22.140
It might be good for you.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:24.768
Okay.

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:28.063
Ma, believe me, okay?

01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:30.899
I'm fine.

01:01:31.817 --> 01:01:33.068
Believe me.

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:36.613
I am absolutely fine.

01:01:40.868 --> 01:01:41.869
Then will you drop it?

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:54.464
Good.

01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:57.467
Now get some rest.

01:01:58.093 --> 01:01:59.928
And save your energy
for the wedding.

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:15.152
Oh, my goodness!
I'm so excited.

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:16.570
Good to see you too.

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:20.240
-Um, do you think I have enough…
-It's all right. I've got it.

01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:23.785
Right.

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:33.045
Yay. Come on.

01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:34.213
I'm coming.

01:02:53.607 --> 01:02:55.859
What do you want?

01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:58.403
I'm really sorry. I got carried away.
I'm sorry.

01:02:58.487 --> 01:02:59.488
No shit.

01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:02.074
I mean, telling us to piss off
when we risked our lives--

01:03:02.157 --> 01:03:05.869
-Academic careers.
-Our academic careers to help you.

01:03:05.953 --> 01:03:07.496
Yeah, that was a real bastard move.

01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:09.331
I know. I'm sorry. I just--

01:03:10.123 --> 01:03:14.002
I need you, please. Okay, everything--
I don't know what to do.

01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:16.880
Nope. Sorry, mate.

01:03:16.964 --> 01:03:18.131
Can't help. Sozzles.

01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:19.466
Okay. Please-- Okay.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.677
You were right, okay?
You were right.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.472
Salim's fit, and he's nice,
and he's taking her to paradise, but--

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:27.891
but--

01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:30.060
But I found something.

01:03:32.938 --> 01:03:33.939
A lab?

01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:37.192
Yeah. He scanned all the women
at the Eid soiree,

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:38.944
collected all of this data.

01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:41.196
-Oh, mate.
-What kind of data?

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.283
I don't know.
Like, uterus strength, fertility--

01:03:44.366 --> 01:03:45.534
Oh, mate.

01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:46.827
And Lena was the ideal host.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.537
Oh, mate.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.038
Host for what?

01:03:50.622 --> 01:03:51.707
I don't know.

01:03:52.416 --> 01:03:53.876
Mutant hybrid super soldiers.

01:03:55.294 --> 01:03:59.047
All I know is, he's flying her out
to Singapore the night of the wedding.

01:03:59.548 --> 01:04:00.966
I have to do something.

01:04:01.049 --> 01:04:02.217
Hey.

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:04.428
We have to do something.

01:04:05.012 --> 01:04:07.222
Yeah.
We're not letting you do this alone.

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:10.976
Handshake?

01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:18.483
-One.
-Two.

01:04:18.567 --> 01:04:19.568
-Three.
-Click.

01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:23.906
Such virgins.

01:04:23.989 --> 01:04:26.116
-Go away, Edith!
-Your dad's a slag. Your mum's a slag.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.452
-Edith, you contemptible shrew!
-And your cat's a slag too!

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:32.831
So how are we gonna get to her?

01:04:33.999 --> 01:04:37.002
The only time we get a clean shot
at Lena is at the wedding.

01:04:37.586 --> 01:04:40.088
We need a diversion to get Lena out.

01:04:40.172 --> 01:04:41.632
Yeah, at what cost?

01:04:41.715 --> 01:04:43.050
Dignity, apparently.

01:04:43.133 --> 01:04:45.677
I still can't believe your mum's
letting you dance at the wedding.

01:04:45.761 --> 01:04:48.764
Yeah, well, she thinks
it'll help me get more involved.

01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:52.184
Little does she know, mischief is afoot.

01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:55.521
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Bloody hell. This is crazy.

01:04:55.604 --> 01:04:57.397
-This is crazy.
-Just shush.

01:04:57.481 --> 01:04:58.857
But chloroform? Really?

01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:00.984
Isn't that a bit--
You know, a bit of a trope?

01:05:01.068 --> 01:05:03.487
There's a reason why tropes are tropes.
It's because they work!

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.113
What if she's brain-dead?

01:05:07.074 --> 01:05:08.200
How long was I out?

01:05:08.283 --> 01:05:09.535
Six minutes.

01:05:09.618 --> 01:05:10.619
Plenty.

01:05:10.702 --> 01:05:12.496
Okay, so we get Lena out.

01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:13.830
Then what?

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:17.417
Then we make our getaway.

01:05:17.918 --> 01:05:18.919
How?

01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:21.547
Go die in a ditch.

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.632
You think I'd lend you my car?

01:05:23.715 --> 01:05:26.969
My dad got it for me for my 16th.
It's a collectible.

01:05:27.052 --> 01:05:29.179
Please.
My sister's about to be inseminated

01:05:29.263 --> 01:05:31.473
with some radioactive sperm or something.

01:05:31.557 --> 01:05:32.766
Pity.

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:34.560
You're failing history.

01:05:37.354 --> 01:05:38.438
You mocking me, Khan?

01:05:38.522 --> 01:05:39.565
No. No, no, no.

01:05:39.648 --> 01:05:41.900
We will do your history coursework
for the rest of the year.

01:05:41.984 --> 01:05:43.986
Yeah. We just need the car.

01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:52.661
So we're going to kidnap Lena
at her own wedding?

01:05:52.744 --> 01:05:53.620
Yep.

01:06:12.973 --> 01:06:15.434
Seriously, Kovacs.
Man, pick up the pace.

01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:16.977
Yeah, we are on a schedule.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.313
My dad's gonna kill me for this.

01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:21.023
I'm literally dead.

01:06:22.399 --> 01:06:23.901
Death comes to us all, man.

01:06:23.984 --> 01:06:26.653
What the--
Why would you say that, man?

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:35.162
Well,

01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:37.497
don't you clean up nice.

01:06:38.582 --> 01:06:39.666
Likewise.

01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:42.628
I'm going to see
if Lena needs anything.

01:06:43.337 --> 01:06:44.421
Good girl.

01:06:45.672 --> 01:06:47.174
I've got my eye on you.

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:20.666
Nuh-uh.

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:22.709
And you are?

01:07:24.044 --> 01:07:26.630
Sister. I'm the sister of the bride.

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.258
Ria.

01:07:36.557 --> 01:07:38.016
I prefer "Ms. Khan."

01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:49.903
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:07:49.987 --> 01:07:50.988
Everything okay?

01:07:52.948 --> 01:07:54.867
Yeah. Yeah, sorry, um…

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:57.786
Just nervous about my dance.

01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:00.956
Thank you.

01:08:04.835 --> 01:08:05.919
How are you?

01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:20.434
I really hate it when we fight.

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:22.685
Me too.

01:08:22.769 --> 01:08:23.937
Lena, I'm really sorry.

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.314
No, you don't have to apologize.

01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:26.564
Yeah, but I got carried away.

01:08:26.648 --> 01:08:28.567
Yeah, but that's because
you actually care.

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:30.986
I am so lucky
to have a sister who's got my back.

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:33.488
-Lena, listen, I--
-No, wait. Um…

01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:37.533
I didn't mean what I said
about you not being a stuntwoman.

01:08:37.618 --> 01:08:39.703
I was just pissed off.

01:08:39.786 --> 01:08:43.207
You are going to be
such a great stuntwoman. I know it.

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.375
You don't have to say that.

01:08:45.459 --> 01:08:47.085
I know I don't, but I mean it.

01:08:48.252 --> 01:08:49.796
Thanks.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.673
Okay.

01:08:56.428 --> 01:09:00.849
Oh, my gosh. I'm going to miss you
so much when I go to Singapore.

01:09:00.933 --> 01:09:01.975
-Lena, I--
-What's wrong?

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:04.937
Yeah, but we can easily put
some extra chairs around table four.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.773
No, we can't.
There's a seating plan for a reason.

01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:08.857
Is everything okay?

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.069
Yes. Everything's perfect.

01:09:12.152 --> 01:09:13.153
Okay.

01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:14.613
You relax, my darling.

01:09:24.456 --> 01:09:25.582
We're here, Khan.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:30.337
You know what? I'm-- I'm just gonna go
and-- and do some more practicing.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.630
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:09:32.589 --> 01:09:34.216
Smarten up, everyone. Please.

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:37.094
Can you stop?

01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:38.261
I'm getting into character.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:39.930
No time, okay? No time!

01:09:40.514 --> 01:09:42.850
These needed to be ready
ten minutes ago, okay?

01:09:44.977 --> 01:09:47.979
Uh, you two,
what time do you call this?

01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:53.026
Leave your bags in the back
and get on the floor now.

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:55.153
-Go on.
-Yep. Yep. Yep.

01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:00.409
We're in.

01:10:00.492 --> 01:10:01.493
We're in.

01:10:01.577 --> 01:10:03.620
Good. I'm heading down.

01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:06.874
FYI, there's a guard outside Lena's room,

01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:08.292
packing heat.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.210
What? Packing heat?

01:10:10.294 --> 01:10:13.088
It means he's got a firearm, dickhead.

01:10:13.172 --> 01:10:15.007
Yeah, I know what it means,
you ding-dong.

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:17.634
I'm just shocked.
I am allowed to be shocked.

01:10:17.718 --> 01:10:18.844
We didn't plan for this.

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:21.096
It's just Raheela trying to spook me.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:22.472
We stick to the plan.

01:10:22.556 --> 01:10:24.391
Nothing changes.

01:10:24.474 --> 01:10:26.852
Just be ready to get Lena out.

01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:28.729
You got this.

01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:30.397
Yeah, mate. You got this.

01:10:38.488 --> 01:10:39.573
Here we go.

01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:08.644
So pretty!

01:11:09.228 --> 01:11:10.270
She's dancing.

01:11:10.354 --> 01:11:11.980
What do you mean she's dancing? Huh?

01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:14.233
-She's not supposed to be dancing yet.
-What?

01:11:14.316 --> 01:11:16.193
The little brat.

01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:27.496
You're not going anywhere.

01:11:27.579 --> 01:11:29.831
No one can see you till the big reveal.

01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:33.377
Beti, I'll come back. You just--

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.379
-Raheela! Raheela.
-Wait-- Mum!

01:11:35.462 --> 01:11:36.839
-Wait for me.
-Mum!

01:11:58.485 --> 01:11:59.486
There they are.

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:00.988
Those mothers.

01:12:01.905 --> 01:12:03.031
We need to hurry.

01:12:15.878 --> 01:12:17.963
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

01:12:18.046 --> 01:12:19.673
Tea's not for another three hours.

01:12:19.756 --> 01:12:20.924
Uh, um, uh…

01:12:21.008 --> 01:12:24.803
Ms. Raleeha-- I mean, Ms. Shah
asked us to bring tea immediately

01:12:24.887 --> 01:12:27.931
-to Ms.-- Ms. Lena.
-'Cause it's her t-- It's--

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:29.016
It's her time.

01:12:31.852 --> 01:12:33.353
Heavy flow.

01:12:33.437 --> 01:12:35.731
Uh, yeah, whatever.

01:12:36.815 --> 01:12:37.649
Hmm.

01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:55.250
Greetings.

01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:57.002
Tea for the bride.

01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:59.421
Sent by Raheela.

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:01.298
To settle Lena's stomach.

01:13:04.301 --> 01:13:06.637
It's her time.

01:13:08.138 --> 01:13:09.806
Heavy flow.

01:13:12.768 --> 01:13:15.354
Tea for the bride.

01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:23.862
Alba.

01:13:24.905 --> 01:13:25.906
Clara.

01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:27.783
What are you doing here?

01:13:32.037 --> 01:13:34.623
-Massively sorry about this.
-About what?

01:13:34.706 --> 01:13:37.042
This.

01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:02.526
Mother's on the move. Hurry.

01:14:02.609 --> 01:14:04.736
Let go. Let-- Let go of me!

01:14:12.786 --> 01:14:15.622
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:14:20.043 --> 01:14:22.546
-What if she's dead?
-Positive mental attitude.

01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:23.630
Come on!

01:14:34.725 --> 01:14:37.728
Thank you, Ms. Lena.

01:14:39.271 --> 01:14:41.607
Let us know if there's anything else
that you want.

01:14:43.525 --> 01:14:45.110
Go, go, go, go. Go!

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.245
Go, go, come on. Go, go.

01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:58.790
Guys, guys! She's almost there.

01:15:00.876 --> 01:15:01.919
Push the button!

01:15:02.002 --> 01:15:03.545
-I'm pushing the button!
-Wha--

01:15:04.129 --> 01:15:05.506
Raheela.

01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:07.049
Raheela.

01:15:07.132 --> 01:15:08.133
Raheela.

01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:09.343
Hurry.

01:15:09.426 --> 01:15:11.553
-Push the button. Push it.
-I was literally pushing it.

01:15:11.637 --> 01:15:13.597
Pushed it 20 times.
What do you think I'm doing?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.058
-Just push it. Alba.
-Pushing the button. Look.

01:15:16.141 --> 01:15:17.142
-Alba.
-Look.

01:15:17.226 --> 01:15:18.519
-Alba.
-I'm pushing it for you.

01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:20.354
-Alba, I'm begging you.
-Mate, mate.

01:15:20.437 --> 01:15:22.189
-Begging you.
-Mate, I'm pushing the button.

01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:24.566
-Bloody hell.
-Yes, there it is.

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:25.734
Go. Come on, come on.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.825
Close. Close. Close!

01:15:44.461 --> 01:15:45.587
Where is she?

01:15:46.839 --> 01:15:49.633
Um, I'm pretty sure I saw her
go outside for a smoke.

01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:51.802
I told you not to let anyone in!

01:15:51.885 --> 01:15:53.887
I-- I didn't. I just--

01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:55.138
Just the tea you sent.

01:15:55.222 --> 01:15:58.600
What tea? Bring her back!
Go! Find her!

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:01.186
-You too. Go. Find her.
-Yeah. Okay.

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.021
Yeah. I'm going. I'm going.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.832
Where is she?

01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:24.793
I don't know. She's probably
just gone out to get a ciggy.

01:16:24.877 --> 01:16:25.878
She gets nervous.

01:16:27.462 --> 01:16:29.756
You think I'm stupid?

01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:35.220
Tell me where she is.

01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:41.894
Come to me. To me. No.
To me. To me. To me.

01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:43.645
Hey. Just come on.

01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:46.231
-Get back. Get back.
-Where is she?

01:16:46.315 --> 01:16:48.525
-Calm down.
-But I can't just calm--

01:16:48.609 --> 01:16:50.611
Why does she always do these things?

01:16:53.363 --> 01:16:55.449
-Ria?
-Don't make me ask you again.

01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:56.533
What's going on?

01:16:59.077 --> 01:17:00.704
Where is she?

01:17:02.414 --> 01:17:04.625
Up your bum. Turn left.

01:17:15.928 --> 01:17:18.597
We're not so different, you and I.

01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:21.183
I'm nothing like you.

01:17:21.767 --> 01:17:24.144
I know about the secret lab,
the testing.

01:17:24.228 --> 01:17:25.979
I know everything!

01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:28.273
Ah.

01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:33.153
Everything, huh? Do you now?

01:17:52.923 --> 01:17:54.174
You've been testing women,

01:17:54.258 --> 01:17:57.761
and you want Lena's genes
to create super babies, or something.

01:18:00.931 --> 01:18:04.101
You think I want Lena's genes?

01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:07.229
Don't be daft.

01:18:07.312 --> 01:18:09.982
There's nothing in her genes
but mediocrity.

01:18:17.114 --> 01:18:18.115
Rude.

01:18:21.577 --> 01:18:23.996
She's just a body.

01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:26.540
A carrier.

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:29.793
A vessel.

01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:33.338
For what?

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.305
For me.

01:18:42.306 --> 01:18:43.348
What?

01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:55.694
Now,

01:18:57.571 --> 01:18:59.489
tell me where she is.

01:19:28.519 --> 01:19:29.520
Never.

01:19:38.153 --> 01:19:39.821
Get Lena out of here. Now.

01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:41.698
Ria, we're not going anywhere
without you.

01:19:46.328 --> 01:19:47.704
Who are you talking to?

01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:53.669
Whoever this is,

01:19:53.752 --> 01:19:56.547
if you want to see Ria alive again,

01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.883
you'd better bring Lena back now.

01:20:15.023 --> 01:20:17.317
You girls these days,

01:20:17.985 --> 01:20:20.195
you have it so easy.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.866
Everything on a plate for you.

01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:26.702
Me?

01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:29.580
As soon as I finished school,

01:20:30.706 --> 01:20:32.916
Abu married me off like that.

01:20:40.966 --> 01:20:43.552
The only good thing
that ever happened to me

01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:46.430
was my beautiful baby boy.

01:20:47.556 --> 01:20:49.850
He knows how much
I've sacrificed for him.

01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:51.894
And he said to me, "Mama,

01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:55.439
I want to give you
the chance you never had.

01:20:56.607 --> 01:20:58.942
I just need the right woman.

01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:01.320
The right match to be the carrier.

01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:03.530
You can do it all over again."

01:21:04.114 --> 01:21:05.240
What?

01:21:08.493 --> 01:21:11.246
Another chance to fulfill my potential.

01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:13.957
To be the woman I was destined to be.

01:21:15.209 --> 01:21:16.877
A new me.

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:18.629
Reborn.

01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:21.924
Clone.

01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:23.759
Yes.

01:21:24.885 --> 01:21:27.888
You'd think any old womb would do,
but apparently not.

01:21:27.971 --> 01:21:30.140
Dolly the sheep was one tough bitch.

01:21:31.642 --> 01:21:33.143
Lena.

01:21:33.227 --> 01:21:34.228
Yes.

01:21:34.978 --> 01:21:36.313
The perfect match.

01:21:36.396 --> 01:21:37.731
Mum, can you check my sleeve?

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:41.568
Salim! Help me, Salim!

01:21:44.154 --> 01:21:46.907
Mum, what are you doing?

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:48.617
It's okay.
I'm handling everything.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.953
-Go back downstairs.
-You left me with Auntie Nazneen.

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:53.163
She's so annoying. My feet hurt.

01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:56.208
I know.
You've been so, so good.

01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.377
-What's taking so long?
-Nothing.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.337
-Who's my good, good boy?
-I am, I am.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:01.922
We're here. We're here.

01:22:02.005 --> 01:22:03.298
Ah, about time.

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:05.300
Salim. Go, baby.

01:22:05.384 --> 01:22:06.677
Lena!

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.345
Guys, no. Get her out!

01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:09.429
Lena!

01:22:10.514 --> 01:22:11.890
Ria!

01:22:11.974 --> 01:22:13.559
-Lena! Lena!
-Ria?

01:22:13.642 --> 01:22:14.685
Lena!

01:22:14.768 --> 01:22:16.353
It's all over, Ria.

01:22:18.105 --> 01:22:19.439
No!

01:22:23.944 --> 01:22:27.656
Please let us out. Please.
Please, please, please let us out.

01:22:27.739 --> 01:22:30.617
Come on!

01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:32.786
Come on!

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:38.959
She's going to use Lena as a vessel
to create her own clone.

01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:43.630
What?

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.050
Wait, what?

01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:49.511
Straight after the ceremony,
Lena's on a plane.

01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:52.014
She'll be gone.

01:22:56.310 --> 01:23:00.314
Let us out!

01:23:00.814 --> 01:23:03.942
-Help!
-Please! Let us out! Let us--

01:23:04.026 --> 01:23:05.652
Oi! Be quiet!

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:22.544
Hey. Um…

01:23:23.295 --> 01:23:25.839
Sounded like you guys
needed some help, so, uh…

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.258
yeah.

01:23:32.888 --> 01:23:34.181
-Yes!
-Yay.

01:23:54.034 --> 01:23:57.412
Marriage in this country

01:23:57.496 --> 01:24:04.211
is the union of two people,
voluntarily entered into for life.

01:24:04.294 --> 01:24:07.506
If you freely undertake
the obligations of marriage…

01:24:14.304 --> 01:24:18.141
♪ My lips are cracked
All black and blue ♪

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:26.191

Please, just shut up. Shut your faces!

01:25:06.565 --> 01:25:08.942
-Ria, what are you doing?
-Ria!

01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:10.235
Sorry, Ma.

01:25:10.319 --> 01:25:13.238
Sorry, Ba. I'm really sorry,
but I need to talk for, like, a sec.

01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:17.242
You little bitch!

01:25:18.535 --> 01:25:19.703
Stay back.

01:25:21.038 --> 01:25:22.331
Do not tempt me.

01:25:22.414 --> 01:25:23.290
Ria.

01:25:24.917 --> 01:25:27.252
Lena, I know you're pissed at me
for being really extra,

01:25:27.336 --> 01:25:30.214
but, seriously,
you should not marry Salim.

01:25:30.797 --> 01:25:32.174
Ria.

01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:33.759
-Ria.
-Okay.

01:25:34.343 --> 01:25:36.512
Okay, it's true. Like, I-- I--

01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:39.181
I didn't want you to get married
'cause I was scared.

01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:41.391
Like, if you can't make it
at what you wanna do,

01:25:41.475 --> 01:25:43.143
then what are the chances for me,
you know?

01:25:44.353 --> 01:25:45.521
And-- And--

01:25:45.604 --> 01:25:48.190
No one believes in me like you do, Lena,
but it's not that.

01:25:48.273 --> 01:25:49.233
-It's just that--
-Ria.

01:25:51.985 --> 01:25:52.986
Ria.

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.364
What are you talking about?

01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:57.616
Li,

01:25:58.283 --> 01:26:01.078
you need to come with me
if you want to live.

01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:02.871
Nice.

01:26:03.664 --> 01:26:05.415
Apparently,
you've got a top-quality womb,

01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:08.418
and he wants to shove
a clone of her into you.

01:26:26.103 --> 01:26:30.023
Vah! What an imagination, mashallah.

01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:36.697
Hey, hey, hey.

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.240
I am serious.

01:26:38.949 --> 01:26:40.951
Ria, baby.

01:26:41.034 --> 01:26:44.371
Put the gun down, baby.
We all know you're gonna miss Lena--

01:26:44.454 --> 01:26:46.039
No, Ma.

01:26:46.123 --> 01:26:47.332
No, I mean--

01:26:47.416 --> 01:26:49.668
Of course I'm gonna miss you, Li.
You're my best friend.

01:26:50.878 --> 01:26:52.963
But you cannot marry Salim.

01:26:53.547 --> 01:26:55.799
He has a secret lab, and he and his mum

01:26:55.883 --> 01:26:58.760
have been doing loads
of weird tests on you.

01:27:06.018 --> 01:27:07.227
Ummi.

01:27:24.036 --> 01:27:25.162
Lena?

01:27:25.829 --> 01:27:26.872
Baby, what's wrong?

01:27:27.706 --> 01:27:29.416
What did you do to me?

01:27:31.293 --> 01:27:32.294
What are you talking about?

01:27:33.295 --> 01:27:35.297
I thought it was just a dream.

01:27:36.215 --> 01:27:39.051
Lena. Lena, I love you.

01:27:40.552 --> 01:27:41.845
You did tests on me.

01:27:49.645 --> 01:27:53.148
Okay, listen. If I did any tests on you,
it was to make sure you were healthy.

01:27:53.232 --> 01:27:54.983
It was because I care.

01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:56.068
And guess what.

01:27:57.569 --> 01:27:58.946
You're more than healthy.

01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:02.616
You are unlike any woman
I've seen before.

01:28:04.243 --> 01:28:05.702
What about your last wife?

01:28:08.914 --> 01:28:10.082
She was weak.

01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:12.960
Not like you.

01:28:13.043 --> 01:28:14.086
Your body--

01:28:14.169 --> 01:28:17.881
Your uterus is 1.8 times stronger
than any woman's I've ever seen before.

01:28:17.965 --> 01:28:19.007
It's magnificent.

01:28:19.091 --> 01:28:20.551
Oh, mate!

01:28:28.433 --> 01:28:30.143
Don't you dare.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.481
Don't you dare.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.818
Oi, you.

01:28:38.652 --> 01:28:39.653
Me?

01:28:40.153 --> 01:28:41.405
You're not going anywhere.

01:28:42.155 --> 01:28:43.699
Come back.

01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:45.033
Sign it.

01:28:45.117 --> 01:28:46.743
Come here.

01:28:48.662 --> 01:28:51.081
Sign it.

01:28:53.876 --> 01:28:55.002
Mummy!

01:28:55.878 --> 01:28:57.754
Lena, run!

01:28:57.838 --> 01:28:58.964
Ria!

01:28:59.047 --> 01:29:00.048
Go!

01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:02.676
Girls, run.

01:29:02.759 --> 01:29:04.428
Go. Go. Run!

01:29:04.511 --> 01:29:09.391
Get me that womb!

01:29:19.193 --> 01:29:20.986
Disgraceful.

01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:22.446
How could you?

01:29:22.946 --> 01:29:24.823
Shame on you.

01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:27.075
No.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.204
Shame on you.

01:30:14.998 --> 01:30:16.500
-Watch out!
-Watch out!

01:30:23.423 --> 01:30:25.759
Run!

01:30:26.677 --> 01:30:27.803
-Run!
-Come on!

01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:37.980
Block the door!

01:30:38.063 --> 01:30:39.314
Block the door!

01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:42.734
Give me your veil.

01:30:44.111 --> 01:30:46.113
We'll lead them away from you.
Get her out.

01:30:46.196 --> 01:30:48.282
What?
No, we are not leaving you guys.

01:30:48.365 --> 01:30:49.867
You have to. Go!

01:30:51.285 --> 01:30:52.578
Get her out of here.

01:30:53.996 --> 01:30:55.831
Kovacs, but-- but your dad?

01:30:55.914 --> 01:30:56.915
Meh.

01:30:57.541 --> 01:30:58.667
He's a dick.

01:31:01.837 --> 01:31:03.297
I heart you guys.

01:31:05.841 --> 01:31:08.218
Ria, we can't hold this, Ria. Go.

01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:11.597
We'll see you in double geography. Go.

01:31:14.892 --> 01:31:16.894
Okay, ready? Ready.

01:31:20.522 --> 01:31:21.523
Go!

01:31:27.362 --> 01:31:29.198
There she goes!

01:31:40.584 --> 01:31:41.585
No.

01:31:44.338 --> 01:31:45.339
Nice try.

01:31:48.842 --> 01:31:52.930
I'm gonna give you five seconds
to move, before I--

01:31:53.013 --> 01:31:55.516
Before you what?

01:31:56.350 --> 01:32:01.271
What could you do to me?

01:32:02.147 --> 01:32:03.690
Hey!

01:32:04.191 --> 01:32:07.027
Let me go, you wanker!

01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:09.029
-Ria!
-Listen, Lena, I'm so sorry.

01:32:09.112 --> 01:32:11.198
Come on! Let me go!

01:32:11.782 --> 01:32:12.699
Ria.

01:32:12.783 --> 01:32:15.285
Foolish, pathetic…

01:32:16.245 --> 01:32:17.621
child.

01:32:17.704 --> 01:32:20.749
Wretched little girl.

01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:25.045
You almost ruined everything for me.

01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:29.049
Get off her! Ria!

01:32:29.716 --> 01:32:31.510
Who do you think you are?

01:32:31.593 --> 01:32:33.345
I'll tell you who you are.

01:32:34.179 --> 01:32:35.889
A silly girl

01:32:35.973 --> 01:32:37.766
with silly ideas.

01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:40.310
Big dreams.

01:32:40.394 --> 01:32:42.396
-Ria!
-But the truth is…

01:32:43.605 --> 01:32:47.192
you're utterly unremarkable.

01:32:48.902 --> 01:32:51.446
A tragic waste

01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:55.075
of human life.

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:00.831
Ria.

01:33:05.419 --> 01:33:06.879
Ria.

01:33:17.139 --> 01:33:18.223
No.

01:33:24.938 --> 01:33:27.232
I am the fury.

01:33:30.152 --> 01:33:31.612
What did you say?

01:33:32.362 --> 01:33:33.447
Ria.

01:33:36.742 --> 01:33:39.870
I am the fury!

01:33:53.342 --> 01:33:55.093
-Mum!
-Nice.

01:34:01.016 --> 01:34:02.476
You drugged me.

01:34:02.559 --> 01:34:04.228
You did tests on me.

01:34:04.311 --> 01:34:05.938
And you tried to shove

01:34:06.021 --> 01:34:07.814
your mum in me!

01:34:07.898 --> 01:34:09.733
And also,

01:34:09.816 --> 01:34:12.069
I may have a magnificent womb,

01:34:12.152 --> 01:34:14.863
but your dick is distinctly average.

01:34:19.409 --> 01:34:21.995
Lena. Lena. We should probs head.

01:34:22.079 --> 01:34:23.247
Right.

01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:24.706
-Come on.
-Yeah.

01:34:25.624 --> 01:34:26.792
-Lena!
-Okay.

01:34:29.044 --> 01:34:30.671
-Lena!
-Okay!

01:34:42.432 --> 01:34:43.851
No!

01:34:43.934 --> 01:34:46.436
No. No. No.

01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:59.491
Listen.

01:35:00.033 --> 01:35:01.368
Lena…

01:35:03.078 --> 01:35:04.413
…I'm really sorry.

01:35:04.955 --> 01:35:06.164
Lena, sorry.

01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:08.041
I-- I'm sorry if I ruined your day.

01:35:12.087 --> 01:35:13.505
You did ruin my day.

01:35:16.592 --> 01:35:17.759
But you saved my life.

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.557
I see what you did there. Dramatic.

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.226
You liked it? The old switcheroo.

01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:28.687
I was like, "Oh, shit. Maybe--

01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:31.565
Maybe she does wanna be
a human vessel for Raheela's clone."

01:35:31.648 --> 01:35:32.941
I'm all right, thanks.

01:35:33.025 --> 01:35:34.610
Yeah, I figured.

01:35:34.693 --> 01:35:38.780
So you were gonna kidnap me…
…and then what?

01:35:38.864 --> 01:35:41.158
What?
What was your plan, mastermind?

01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:44.203
Uh, right. So Alba's parents
have this place in Penrith,

01:35:44.286 --> 01:35:47.206
which is, like,
a countryside sort of place,

01:35:47.289 --> 01:35:50.709
and I-- I bought you loads of easels
and canvases and acrylics.

01:35:50.792 --> 01:35:52.586
I know how much you like acrylics.

01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:55.422
I mean, just in case
you felt like painting again.

01:35:55.506 --> 01:35:57.174
I think I'm gonna take a minute.

01:35:58.592 --> 01:36:00.302
Ruminate on it, you know?

01:36:01.178 --> 01:36:02.596
Mull things over.

01:36:04.264 --> 01:36:05.849
Sure, mull. Uh…

01:36:06.808 --> 01:36:08.143
Mulling is good.

01:36:08.227 --> 01:36:09.686
Whatever works for you.

01:36:14.441 --> 01:36:15.859
I am hungry, though.

01:36:16.652 --> 01:36:18.111
Mmm.

01:36:19.154 --> 01:36:20.739
Mmm.

01:36:29.498 --> 01:36:32.209
So, did you see my kick?

01:36:33.585 --> 01:36:36.088
Of course I bloody did.
It was magical.

01:36:36.171 --> 01:36:39.508
-I was like, "Shit!"
-Me too. Like, "Shit!"

01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:40.968
I'm pretty sure I drew blood.

01:36:41.051 --> 01:36:42.594
I'm pretty sure you did.

01:36:49.476 --> 01:36:51.979
Oh. I wish I got it on camera.

01:36:52.062 --> 01:36:54.439
That would've been so awesome
for my channel.

01:37:00.237 --> 01:37:02.531
And action.

01:37:04.074 --> 01:37:08.328
The gods whisper to the warrior,
"You will not withstand the fury."

01:37:08.412 --> 01:37:09.663
The warrior whispers back--

01:37:09.746 --> 01:37:11.748
Wait, hold on. You got a text.

01:37:12.457 --> 01:37:15.085
-What's going on? Come on.
-Who's it from? Let's see.

01:37:17.462 --> 01:37:18.714
It's from Eunice.

01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:20.340
It's from Eunice! What do I do?

01:37:20.424 --> 01:37:21.592
-What do I do?
-Read it.

01:37:22.885 --> 01:37:24.636
Ria, sorry for my late response.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.471
I've been busy on a Marvel.

01:37:26.555 --> 01:37:28.557
I hope you don't give up
on being a stuntwoman,

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.643
because I watched your videos
and I think you're ace.

01:37:31.727 --> 01:37:33.770
She watched my videos.

01:37:33.854 --> 01:37:36.231
-She thinks I'm ace!
-She thinks you're ace!

01:37:36.815 --> 01:37:38.066
I agree with your sister.

01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:40.819
You've got real potential.
You could be the best.

01:37:40.903 --> 01:37:43.947
Why don't you swing by my studio
sometime next week?

01:37:44.031 --> 01:37:45.282
We can get brunch.

01:37:47.534 --> 01:37:50.037
Holy shit.

01:37:51.163 --> 01:37:53.457
She wants to get brunch.

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:55.125
-Brunch, brunch!
-Brunch! Brunch!

01:37:55.209 --> 01:37:56.960
-Brunch, brunch!
-I'm going for brunch!

01:37:57.044 --> 01:38:00.047
-Brunch! Brunch, brunch!
-Brunch! Brunch! Brunch, brunch!

01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:03.258
-You're going brunch! Brunch!
-Brunch!

01:38:03.342 --> 01:38:05.802
-Yeah. You're going for brunch!
-I'm going for brunch!

01:38:05.886 --> 01:38:09.181
-You're going for brunch!
-Yes! With Eunice!

01:38:10.265 --> 01:38:11.767
Let's show her what you're made of.

01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:13.977
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:38:16.271 --> 01:38:17.272
Let's go.

01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:21.109
You got this.

01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:23.612
Action.

01:38:24.279 --> 01:38:26.240
The gods whisper to the warrior,

01:38:26.323 --> 01:38:28.867
"You will not withstand the fury."

01:38:29.451 --> 01:38:31.245
The warrior whispers back…

01:38:33.247 --> 01:38:36.083
"I am the fury."
