BOOKTASTIC BUS.

00:40.714 --> 00:42.447
READING
SUCKS ASS.

00:42.449 --> 00:44.315
ERIC, SHUT UP!

00:46.186 --> 00:47.151
BORING.

00:47.153 --> 00:48.152
BORING.

00:48.154 --> 00:48.753
GAY.

00:48.755 --> 00:49.687
BORING,
BORING.

00:49.689 --> 00:51.656
CHECK OUT
<i>THESE</i> BOOKS.

00:51.658 --> 00:54.125
"SABRINA UNCHAINED."

00:54.127 --> 00:56.360
THESE BOOKS
LOOK COOL.

00:56.362 --> 00:59.630
THERE'S A LOT OF BIG WORDS
IN THESE BOOKS.

00:59.632 --> 01:00.932
( mumbling )

01:00.934 --> 01:01.666
HELLO, KIDS.

01:01.668 --> 01:03.935
I SEE YOU'RE DISCOVERING
THE MAGIC OF READING.

01:03.937 --> 01:04.736
WHO ARE YOU?

01:04.738 --> 01:06.904
I DRIVE THE BOOKTASTIC BUS,
WHERE MAGIC BEGINS.

01:06.906 --> 01:10.208
YOU SEE, READING OPENS UP
WHOLE NEW WORLDS TO YOU.

01:10.210 --> 01:12.110
YOU CAN TAKE A CANOE
DOWN THE AMAZON,

01:12.112 --> 01:13.711
OR GO BACK IN TIME
TO CAMELOT,

01:13.713 --> 01:15.113
OR BECOME
A RACE CAR DRIVER,

01:15.115 --> 01:16.981
ALL BY JUST
OPENING A BOOK.

01:16.983 --> 01:17.915
JUST LIKE MAGIC.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.016
THE MAGIC OF READING.

01:19.018 --> 01:20.485
GOSH,
SHUT UP, DUDE.

01:20.487 --> 01:21.986
GO AHEAD AND PICK
ANY BOOKS YOU LIKE,

01:21.988 --> 01:24.522
THEN GIVE IN,
GIVE IN TO THE MAGIC.

01:24.524 --> 01:26.824
IF WE READ, ARE WE GONNA
BECOME LIKE THAT GUY?

01:26.826 --> 01:28.359
YEAH, THIS IS STUPID,
BOOKS AREN'T MAGICAL.

01:28.361 --> 01:32.663
I'M KIND OF GETTING A TINGLY
FEELING LOOKING AT THESE.

01:32.665 --> 01:33.731
( chicken clucking )

01:33.733 --> 01:34.465
( mumbling )

01:34.467 --> 01:35.733
I DON'T KNOW,
LET'S GO SEE.

01:35.735 --> 01:40.104
BEING AN OFFICER OF THE PEACE
MEANS A LOT OF THINGS.

01:40.106 --> 01:44.142
IT'S A HARD JOB, BUT THEN AGAIN,
I'M A HARD MAN.

01:44.144 --> 01:46.410
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
THAT IN A SMALL TOWN

01:46.412 --> 01:48.980
THERE ISN'T A LOT
FOR THE LAW TO DO.

01:48.982 --> 01:50.348
WELL, THEY'RE WRONG.

01:50.350 --> 01:51.516
( radio )
All units, all units,

01:51.518 --> 01:53.684
report to 2-5-4
Avenue De Los Mexicanos.

01:53.686 --> 01:55.686
Possible
hostile situation.

01:55.688 --> 01:57.054
THERE, YOU SEE?

01:57.056 --> 01:58.589
THIS COULD BE
A BANK ROBBERY,

01:58.591 --> 02:00.424
OR POSSIBLY
EVEN A MURDER!

02:00.426 --> 02:02.293
THIS AIN'T
NO LITTLE TOWN.

02:02.295 --> 02:03.694
Barbrady,
your wife called,

02:03.696 --> 02:06.264
she wants you to get
some pizza on the way home.

02:06.266 --> 02:07.398
GODDAMNIT!

02:10.270 --> 02:12.570
OKAY, PEOPLE,
MOVE ALONG.

02:12.572 --> 02:15.139
THERE'S NOTHING
TO SEE HERE.

02:15.141 --> 02:16.908
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE?
WHERE'S THE BODY?

02:16.910 --> 02:19.143
BARBRADY, I JUST CAUGHT
SOME GUY IN HERE

02:19.145 --> 02:22.079
HAVING SEX WITH
ONE OF MY CHICKENS.

02:25.852 --> 02:27.518
OH.

02:27.654 --> 02:29.287
MY GOD,
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

02:29.289 --> 02:31.889
WHOA, DUDE, HOW DO YOU
HAVE SEX WITH A CHICKEN?

02:31.891 --> 02:33.491
BOYS,
YOU MOVE ALONG.

02:33.493 --> 02:35.326
THIS ISN'T
FOR YOUNG EYES TO SEE.

02:35.328 --> 02:37.728
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THE SUSPECT?

02:37.730 --> 02:39.063
NO, I DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

02:39.065 --> 02:40.431
IT JUST
HAPPENED SO FAST.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.901
WELL, THIS IS QUITE
INTERESTING, HUH, GUYS?

02:43.903 --> 02:46.504
WE'RE GONNA GO
GRAB SOME LUNCH

02:46.506 --> 02:48.873
AND MAYBE GET SOME SHOTS
OF THOSE TURTLES

02:48.875 --> 02:49.941
DOWN AT THE POND.

02:49.943 --> 02:52.043
AH, CAMEL POO!

02:52.045 --> 02:53.244
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

02:53.246 --> 02:54.545
IT LOOKS
LIKE A NOTE.

02:54.547 --> 02:56.013
GIVE ME THAT!
THAT'S A CLUE

02:56.015 --> 02:59.083
AND YOU'LL GET YOUR
STINKING DNA ALL OVER IT.

02:59.085 --> 03:00.284
WHAT DOES
IT SAY?

03:00.286 --> 03:01.986
IT SAYS...

03:01.988 --> 03:04.488
"SORRY I HAD SEX
WITH THE CHICKEN.

03:04.490 --> 03:06.824
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN,
BYE, BYE."

03:06.826 --> 03:08.326
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT,
CASE CLOSED.

03:08.328 --> 03:10.595
DAMMIT, BARBRADY, WHAT
THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?

03:10.597 --> 03:12.363
EVERY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS
IN THIS TOWN,

03:12.365 --> 03:15.066
YOU SAY "NOTHING TO SEE HERE"
AND "CASE CLOSED",

03:15.068 --> 03:16.567
BUT WE WANT
JUSTICE!

03:16.569 --> 03:18.502
WE HAVE TO FIND
THIS SICKO!

03:18.504 --> 03:20.104
I SAID
RETURN TO YOUR HOMES

03:20.106 --> 03:22.073
BEFORE I START
ARRESTING PEOPLE!

03:22.075 --> 03:23.774
FOR WHAT?
ORDERLY CONDUCT?

03:23.776 --> 03:25.810
HOW ABOUT FISHING
WITHOUT A LICENSE?

03:25.812 --> 03:27.011
I'M NOT FISHING.

03:27.013 --> 03:28.646
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THIS THEN?

03:28.648 --> 03:29.847
IF YOU
DO NOT COMPLY,

03:29.849 --> 03:32.783
I'LL BE FORCED TO EXECUTE
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

03:32.785 --> 03:34.719
BY GUNSHOT
TO THE HEAD.

03:34.721 --> 03:36.120
THAT'S RIGHT,

03:36.122 --> 03:37.655
RETURN TO YOUR
SIMPLE LIVES.

03:37.657 --> 03:40.057
JUST FORGET
THIS EVER HAPPENED.

03:40.059 --> 03:41.459
FORGET,

03:41.461 --> 03:42.460
FORGET.

03:42.462 --> 03:44.795
WOW, BARBRADY
SURE IS ACTING WEIRD.

03:44.797 --> 03:47.632
YEAH, I WONDER
WHAT'S WRONG.

04:01.881 --> 04:05.416
( male )
Welcome to Fran's,
can I help you?

04:07.720 --> 04:09.620
Sir, can I help you?

04:09.622 --> 04:12.256
JUST GIVE ME
TWO CHEESEBURGERS

04:12.258 --> 04:14.392
AND SOME
JALAPENO POPPERS.

04:14.394 --> 04:16.861
Sir, there's
just one problem.

04:16.863 --> 04:17.962
WHAT'S THAT?

04:17.964 --> 04:19.797
We're a bank.

04:20.099 --> 04:22.099
I KNOW THAT,
SMARTY PANTS!

04:22.101 --> 04:25.569
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I'M SOME KIND OF IDIOT?!

04:25.571 --> 04:26.637
Yes.

04:26.639 --> 04:28.105
HMM.

04:28.808 --> 04:31.976
I CAN'T GO ON
LIVING THIS LIE!

04:31.978 --> 04:34.845
With chicken after chicken
being violated,

04:34.847 --> 04:37.782
the South Park police
are under increasing pressure

04:37.784 --> 04:40.451
to solve the case
of the chicken<i>!@#$%.</i>

04:40.453 --> 04:42.453
We now go live
to a press conference

04:42.455 --> 04:44.355
where Officer Barbrady
and the mayor

04:44.357 --> 04:45.856
are fielding
questions.

04:45.858 --> 04:46.791
OFFICER BARBRADY,

04:46.793 --> 04:50.294
WHAT WOULD DRIVE A MAN
TO SUCH A DISGUSTING ACT?

04:50.296 --> 04:52.029
WELL, NOBODY
CAN SAY FOR SURE.

04:52.031 --> 04:54.598
NO MOTIVE HAS YET
BEEN ESTABLISHED.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.467
DO THE POLICE
HAVE ANY LEADS?

04:56.469 --> 04:59.036
WELL, BOTH
3-D COMPUTER MODELING

04:59.038 --> 05:00.404
AND INTENSIVE
SEISMOLOGY

05:00.406 --> 05:02.406
HAVE NOT GIVEN US
ANY LEADS AS OF YET.

05:02.408 --> 05:05.209
BUT HAS CHICKEN!@#$%
LEFT ANY CLUES AT THE CRIME?

05:05.211 --> 05:09.113
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,
I CAN'T READ!

05:11.751 --> 05:13.951
THERE, I SAID IT,
I CAN'T READ.

05:13.953 --> 05:15.319
ARE YOU
HAPPY NOW?

05:15.321 --> 05:16.454
YOU PUSHED
AND YOU PUSHED

05:16.456 --> 05:18.956
AND NOW YOU ALL KNOW
MY TERRIBLE SECRET!

05:18.958 --> 05:20.558
I'M ILLEGITIMATE!

05:20.560 --> 05:22.827
I'M NOT FIT TO BE
A POLICEMEN.

05:22.829 --> 05:24.528
I RETIRE!

05:24.597 --> 05:26.731
OKAY, THANK YOU
ALL FOR COMING.

05:26.733 --> 05:29.700
THERE'S COFFEE
AND BROWNIES OUT FRONT.

05:29.702 --> 05:32.970
And so Officer Barbrady
has taken a leave of absence

05:32.972 --> 05:35.106
and South Park
will have to manage

05:35.108 --> 05:37.508
without any
police force for a while.

05:37.510 --> 05:38.476
This just in,

05:38.478 --> 05:40.811
South Park has plunged
into total anarchy.

05:40.813 --> 05:44.281
Exactly two seconds
after the retirement
of Officer Barbrady,

05:44.283 --> 05:48.285
looting and pillaging erupted
in the quiet mountain town.

05:48.287 --> 05:50.287
( yelling )

05:52.992 --> 05:54.025
WHOOPIE!

05:54.027 --> 05:54.859
THIS IS KILLER.

05:54.861 --> 05:57.328
WITH NO COPS AROUND,
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT!

05:57.330 --> 05:59.330
WOAH, DUDE,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:59.332 --> 06:00.898
I DON'T KNOW.

06:01.134 --> 06:04.502
OH, MY GOD,
THEY'VE KILLED--

06:04.871 --> 06:06.070
OH, NEVER MIND.

06:06.072 --> 06:07.471
I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

06:07.473 --> 06:11.442
ALL THIS TIME BARBRADY ACTUALLY
<i>DID</i> KEEP THIS TOWN PEACEFUL.

06:11.444 --> 06:12.209
WHO KNEW?

06:12.211 --> 06:14.412
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
HE WAS A COMPLETE IDIOT.

06:14.414 --> 06:15.079
HE IS.

06:15.081 --> 06:18.382
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO
ABOUT THE SOUTH PARK RIOTS?

06:18.384 --> 06:19.750
NO REASON
FOR CONCERN.

06:19.752 --> 06:22.620
I WANT TO ASSURE ALL OF YOU
THAT OFFICER BARBRADY

06:22.622 --> 06:24.588
IS STILL OUR
ACTIVE POLICE FORCE.

06:24.590 --> 06:27.324
BUT HE'S ILLITERATE,
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO?

06:27.326 --> 06:28.359
PLAN?

06:28.361 --> 06:29.560
I DON'T ACTUALLY...

06:29.562 --> 06:30.961
READING CLASSES,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

06:30.963 --> 06:32.329
BY THE MAYOR'S ORDER
OFFICER BARBRADY

06:32.331 --> 06:34.865
IS ON TEMPORARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE
TO LEARN TO READ.

06:34.867 --> 06:36.400
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

06:36.402 --> 06:37.301
YES,
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:37.303 --> 06:40.104
IT'S BACK TO SCHOOL
WITH OFFICER BARBRADY!

06:40.106 --> 06:43.474
NOW, CHILDREN, WE HAVE A
NEW STUDENT JOINING US TODAY.

06:43.476 --> 06:47.478
PLEASE SAY HI
TO OFFICER BARBRADY.

06:47.880 --> 06:48.813
I CAN'T SEE,
DUDE.

06:48.815 --> 06:50.948
OKAY, NOW SINCE OUR FOCUS
HAS BEEN ON READING,

06:50.950 --> 06:52.917
LET'S REVIEW
SOME OF THE BASICS.

06:52.919 --> 06:54.318
YES,
WHAT IS IT?

06:54.320 --> 06:56.120
I NEED
TO GO POOPIES.

06:56.122 --> 06:57.488
OFFICER BARBRADY,

06:57.490 --> 07:01.258
IN SCHOOL WE GO TO THE BATHROOM
BEFORE AND AFTER CLASS.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.861
OH, CHRIST,
HOW DO YOU KIDS DO IT?

07:03.863 --> 07:05.496
DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANY SUGGESTIONS

07:05.498 --> 07:07.932
WHERE WE SHOULD BEGIN
WITH OFFICER BARBRADY?

07:07.934 --> 07:09.133
HOW ABOUT
A BRAIN TRANSPLANT?

07:09.135 --> 07:12.002
NOW, KYLE, LET'S BE SUPPORTIVE
OF OUR NEW STUDENT.

07:12.004 --> 07:14.972
GIVE HIM THE
NURTURING ENVIRONMENT
HE NEEDS TO THRIVE.

07:14.974 --> 07:16.207
NOW I'M GOING
TO WRITE A SENTENCE

07:16.209 --> 07:19.844
AND I WANT US ALL TO HELP
OFFICER BARBRADY READ IT.

07:19.979 --> 07:23.214
GIVE IT A SHOT,
OFFICER BARBRADY.

07:23.216 --> 07:24.915
UH...

07:25.351 --> 07:27.284
"O...
O."

07:27.286 --> 07:30.287
BZZT, WRONG!
TRY AGAIN, DUMB-ASS.

07:30.289 --> 07:31.789
( laughing )

07:32.058 --> 07:33.224
OKAY, OKAY,

07:33.226 --> 07:35.626
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY
SOMETHING A LITTLE EASIER.

07:35.628 --> 07:37.928
WE CAN WORK OUR WAY UP
TO THE HARD ONES.

07:37.930 --> 07:40.598
GO AHEAD, BARBRADY,
DON'T BE SCARED.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.932
UH...

07:41.934 --> 07:42.700
"O..."

07:42.702 --> 07:44.668
BZZT! DID YOU
HEAR THAT MR. HAT?

07:44.670 --> 07:47.838
I SURE DID, MR. GARRISON.
WHAT A RETARD.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.739
( laughing )

07:48.741 --> 07:51.775
DID YOU KIDS ACTUALLY LEARN
HOW TO READ THIS WAY?

07:51.777 --> 07:53.777
NO, WE JUST FAKE IT
TO SHUT HIM UP.

07:53.779 --> 07:56.080
OKAY, OKAY,
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

07:56.082 --> 07:58.883
LET'S TRY AGAIN.

07:58.951 --> 08:00.618
( clucking )

08:03.055 --> 08:05.556
( male )
SAY, WHAT ARE
NICE CHICKENS LIKE YOU

08:05.558 --> 08:08.759
DOING IN A COOP
LIKE THIS?

08:09.095 --> 08:14.298
( loud clucking )

08:14.300 --> 08:15.132
NOW, CHILDREN,

08:15.134 --> 08:17.134
I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GOOD TIME
READING YOUR BOOKS

08:17.136 --> 08:18.869
AND ARE PREPARED
FOR YOUR BOOK REPORTS.

08:18.871 --> 08:22.206
WHO SHOULD WE HAVE
GO FIRST, MR. HAT?

08:22.208 --> 08:22.973
LET'S SEE.

08:22.975 --> 08:25.409
HOW ABOUT
STAN OR KYLE?

08:25.411 --> 08:27.711
ERIC, WHY DON'T
YOU GO FIRST?

08:27.713 --> 08:28.312
UGH.

08:28.314 --> 08:30.814
ARE YOU NOT
PREPARED AGAIN?

08:30.816 --> 08:31.615
I'M PREPARED!

08:31.617 --> 08:33.617
FOR MY BOOK REPORT
I READ

08:33.619 --> 08:36.387
"THE LION, THE WITCH,
AND THE WARDROBE."

08:36.389 --> 08:37.955
IT WAS VERY,
VERY, GOOD.

08:37.957 --> 08:39.823
HAVE YOU READ IT,
MR. GARRISON?

08:39.825 --> 08:41.759
NO, I CAN'T
SAY THAT I HAVE.

08:41.761 --> 08:42.493
OH, GOOD.

08:42.495 --> 08:43.761
IN "THE LION, THE WITCH,
AND THE WARDROBE",

08:43.763 --> 08:45.763
A BUNCH OF HIPPIES
WALK AROUND AND PAINT STUFF.

08:45.765 --> 08:49.400
THEY EAT LUNCH AND THEN THEY
FIND A MAGICAL<i> CAMEL</i>

08:49.402 --> 08:51.502
WHICH THEY HAVE
TO EAT TO STAY ALIVE,

08:51.504 --> 08:53.003
AND THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT.

08:53.005 --> 08:53.904
I GIVE IT
A "B MINUS".

08:53.906 --> 08:56.640
AND I GIVE YOU AN "F", ERIC,
NOW SIT DOWN.

08:56.642 --> 08:58.442
GODDAMNIT!

08:58.444 --> 08:59.610
( laughing )

08:59.612 --> 09:01.045
OKAY,
OFFICER BARBRADY,

09:01.047 --> 09:03.914
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US
YOUR BOOK REPORT?

09:03.916 --> 09:07.284
I'VE JUST FINISHED READING
THE HEARTWARMING NOVEL,

09:07.286 --> 09:08.319
"GO, DOG, GO".

09:08.321 --> 09:11.155
I FOUND IT A COMPELLING
AND DISTURBING LOOK

09:11.157 --> 09:12.823
AT THE CANINE PSYCHE.

09:12.825 --> 09:15.326
IF I MAY READ
A PASSAGE.

09:15.761 --> 09:18.262
"BIG DOG...

09:18.598 --> 09:21.632
"LITTLE DOG.

09:23.703 --> 09:26.570
"A RED DOG

09:26.572 --> 09:28.872
ON A..."

09:28.874 --> 09:30.107
WELL, ANYWAY,

09:30.109 --> 09:32.276
I DON'T WANT TO
GIVE AWAY THE ENDING,

09:32.278 --> 09:36.180
BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT SPIRALS
TOWARD AN INCREDIBLE TWIST-TURN

09:36.182 --> 09:38.249
THAT PARALLELS
MY OWN LIFE.

09:38.251 --> 09:39.717
THANK YOU,

09:39.719 --> 09:42.119

10:22.061 --> 10:24.395
THE CHICKEN!@#$%

CARLA WEATHERS' PRIZE CHICKEN.

10:33.139 --> 10:34.071
SHE'S CATATONIC.

10:34.073 --> 10:36.106
WHO, CARLA WEATHERS
OR THE CHICKEN?

10:36.108 --> 10:39.176
THE PERPETRATOR LEFT THIS CLUE
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

10:39.178 --> 10:40.944
OH, I CAN'T READ THIS.

10:40.946 --> 10:42.079

A POND.

12:23.983 --> 12:25.482
MAYBE THAT MEANS
STARK'S POND.

12:25.484 --> 12:27.084

13:30.549 --> 13:33.150
THE CHICKENS DON'T SEEM
TO REALLY MIND.

13:33.152 --> 13:34.117
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

13:34.119 --> 13:36.386
WHO WOULD HAVE SEX
WITH A CHICKEN?

13:36.388 --> 13:37.120

OH, NO!

17:36.395 --> 17:37.561
( rustling )

17:37.563 --> 17:38.762
SHH!

17:40.933 --> 17:43.700
KEEP YOUR
EYES PEELED.

17:44.236 --> 17:45.769
LOOK!

17:46.305 --> 17:47.804
HE'S HERE.

17:47.806 --> 17:49.372
GRAB HIM!

17:49.641 --> 17:50.407
( sirens )

17:50.409 --> 17:53.710
DAMMIT, CAN'T THIS THING
GO ANY FASTER?

17:57.950 --> 17:59.382
( gunshot )

17:59.384 --> 18:02.586
OH, MY GOD,
THEY'VE KILLED--

18:02.788 --> 18:03.487
GODDAMNIT.

18:03.489 --> 18:06.423
I KNEW IT WAS YOU ALL ALONG,
RICHARD NIXON.

18:06.425 --> 18:08.692
I THINK
THAT'S A MASK, DUDE.

18:08.694 --> 18:09.960
OH.

18:10.295 --> 18:11.228
WHOA, DUDE.

18:11.230 --> 18:12.729
IT'S THE
BOOK MOBILE DRIVER.

18:12.731 --> 18:15.065
CAUGHT YOU
RED-HANDED.

18:15.067 --> 18:15.866
INDEED YOU DID.

18:15.868 --> 18:17.467
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WOULD STRIKE HERE?

18:17.469 --> 18:20.070
BY READING
"TEETLE THE TIMID TAXIDERMIST".

18:20.072 --> 18:22.539
YOU DID, REALLY?
THEN IT WORKED.

18:22.541 --> 18:24.975
MY WHOLE PLAN WORKED
ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY.

18:24.977 --> 18:26.309
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, DUDE?

18:26.311 --> 18:28.945
WHEN I HEARD THAT
OFFICER BARBRADY COULDN'T READ,

18:28.947 --> 18:30.881
I KNEW I HAD TO
MOTIVATE HIM SOMEHOW.

18:30.883 --> 18:32.883
SO I FORMULATED A PLAN
TO ENCOURAGE HIM

18:32.885 --> 18:34.718
TO LEARN
THE MAGIC OF READING.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.653
SO YOU!@#$%
A BUNCH OF CHICKENS?

18:36.655 --> 18:38.555
YES, YES,
EXACTLY.

18:38.557 --> 18:40.624
DON'T YOU SEE,
ONLY BY!@#$% CHICKENS

18:40.626 --> 18:42.759
COULD I GET OFFICER BARBRADY
TO BECOME LITERATE.

18:42.761 --> 18:44.861
THAT DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE
LOT OF SENSE, DUDE.

18:44.863 --> 18:47.264
OH, NO?
HE WHO IS BLIND CAN NOW SEE.

18:47.266 --> 18:49.699
I GOT OFFICER BARBRADY
TO READ.

18:49.701 --> 18:51.368
MY PLAN
WORKED PERFECTLY.

18:51.370 --> 18:54.971
WELL, I GUESS
I SHOULD SAY THANKS?

18:54.973 --> 18:55.839
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:55.841 --> 18:56.907
AND NOW
MY READING FRIEND,

18:56.909 --> 18:58.975
YOU'VE PROVEN THAT
YOU ARE READY FOR THE BIG TIME.

18:58.977 --> 19:00.610
I GIVE YOU
THIS HARDBACK COPY

19:00.612 --> 19:02.479
OF "ATLAS SHRUGGED"
BY AYN RAND.

19:02.481 --> 19:04.981
FREEZE!
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!

19:04.983 --> 19:05.749
CARTMAN!

19:05.751 --> 19:07.884
I GOT A REPORT
THE SUSPECT IS IN THIS AREA.

19:07.886 --> 19:08.685
WELL, HE IS.

19:08.687 --> 19:10.053
IT TURNS OUT
THE BOOK MOBILE DRIVER

19:10.055 --> 19:11.888
WAS THE ONE
MAKING LOVE TO CHICKENS.

19:11.890 --> 19:12.889
AH, HA!

19:12.891 --> 19:14.024
OW, THAT HURTS!

19:14.026 --> 19:14.958
WHOA, DUDE.

19:14.960 --> 19:15.692
CARTMAN!

19:15.694 --> 19:17.994
THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU UPHOLD THE LAW!

19:17.996 --> 19:21.231
BUT HE IS NOT LISTENING
TO MY AUTHORITY.

19:21.233 --> 19:25.435
OH, YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG,
MY LITTLE FRIEND.

19:25.437 --> 19:27.003
YOU DO IT
LIKE THIS.

19:27.005 --> 19:29.206
YOU GOTTA
GET THEM IN THE HEAD.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.007
THEY GO DOWN QUICKER.

19:31.009 --> 19:31.708
<i>OH.</i>

19:31.710 --> 19:33.376
I GUESS YOU SHOULD
LEAVE POLICE WORK

19:33.378 --> 19:34.578
TO THE PROFESSIONALS,
HUH, CARTMAN?

19:34.580 --> 19:37.147
WELL, ANYWAY, I'M RELIEVING YOU
OF YOUR DUTIES.

19:37.149 --> 19:38.715
I'VE PROVED
THAT I CAN READ,

19:38.717 --> 19:40.684
AND NOW
I'M BACK ON THE JOB.

19:40.686 --> 19:41.651
( together )
HURRAY!

19:41.653 --> 19:44.721
HEY, SO WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO NOW?

19:44.723 --> 19:45.455
NOW?

19:45.457 --> 19:48.558
I THINK I'LL GET
IN THE BATHTUB

19:48.560 --> 19:53.296
AND THEN CURL UP
WITH A GOOD BOOK.

20:17.155 --> 20:19.623
And so today,
South Park held a parade

20:19.625 --> 20:20.957
to honor
Officer Barbrady

20:20.959 --> 20:25.528
and his heroic work
on the chicken!@#$% case.

20:26.431 --> 20:30.500
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY,
THANK YOU!

20:30.502 --> 20:32.469
SPEECH, SPEECH!

20:32.471 --> 20:33.136
WHAT?

20:33.138 --> 20:34.704
THEY WANT YOU
TO GIVE A SPEECH.

20:34.706 --> 20:37.407
ABOUT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

20:37.409 --> 20:38.441
OH, OKAY.

20:38.443 --> 20:39.342
WELL, FIRST OF ALL

20:39.344 --> 20:41.711
I'D LIKE TO THANK
THE TOWN OF SOUTH PARK,

20:41.713 --> 20:42.746
THE TOWN THAT BORE ME

20:42.748 --> 20:44.681
AND EVENTUALLY WILL ROB ME
OF MY LIFE PRECIOUS.

20:44.683 --> 20:47.884
SECOND, I'D LIKE TO SAY
TO ALL THOSE OUT THERE

20:47.886 --> 20:49.552
WHO THINK THEY CAN
SCREW CHICKENS

20:49.554 --> 20:51.354
JUST TO TEACH
PEOPLE TO READ,

20:51.356 --> 20:53.590
YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED!

20:54.192 --> 20:56.626
AND FINALLY
I'D LIKE TO SAY

20:56.628 --> 21:00.196
THAT READING
TOTALLY SUCKS ASS.

21:00.198 --> 21:01.164
( together )
HURRAY!

21:01.166 --> 21:04.000
YES, AT FIRST I WAS HAPPY
TO BE LEARNING HOW TO READ.

21:04.002 --> 21:06.403
IT SEEMED EXCITING
AND MAGICAL,

21:06.405 --> 21:07.938
BUT THEN I READ THIS,

21:07.940 --> 21:09.739
"ATLAS SHRUGGED",
BY AYN RAND.

21:09.741 --> 21:12.042
I READ EVERY LAST WORD
OF THIS GARBAGE

21:12.044 --> 21:14.144
AND BECAUSE OF
THIS PIECE OF!@#$%

21:14.146 --> 21:16.012
I'M NEVER
READING AGAIN!

21:16.014 --> 21:17.747
( together )
HURRAY FOR BARBRADY!

21:17.749 --> 21:20.050
I GUESS READING
REALLY DOES SUCK ASS.

21:20.052 --> 21:22.686
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING
ALL ALONG, YOU GUYS.

21:22.688 --> 21:24.821
I'M JUST GLAD EVERYTHING
TURNED OUT OKAY,

21:24.823 --> 21:26.890
AND BARBRADY
GOT HIS JOB BACK.

21:26.892 --> 21:28.558
IT'S POETIC
JUSTICE.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.226
THANKS, BOYS.

21:58.190 --> 22:00.590
( chicken clucking )
