00:14.723 --> 00:19.019
San Gabriel Island reactor's just gone critical.
Core material is now airborne.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.813
I thought we had more time.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.691
<i>At this REM rate the radiation will get stronger</i>

00:24.775 --> 00:27.903
<i>and will spill into the atmosphere
until the core is exhausted. </i>

00:27.986 --> 00:31.198
Son, you've done everything you can,
now get out of there.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.952
<i>Evacuating won't make any difference, sir. 
We've already been exposed. </i>

00:35.035 --> 00:39.498
Jack has got to find the override
before the rest of these reactors go critical.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.959
I know about you and him,
and I am not OK with it.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.213
- You and I aren't together.
- We were trying to work things out.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.007
Yeah, I tried.
But you kept putting it off.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.177
- What did you say to Paul?
- That I'm filing for divorce.

00:52.678 --> 00:56.682
- Somebody set me up.
- Thousands of lives are at stake.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.435
Where are the people
who control the override?

01:00.519 --> 01:03.939
- Talk to me, Sarah.
- I'm not a spy.

01:07.985 --> 01:11.196
Erin, Powell's dead. He was hit
by a sniper when we arrested him.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.827
<i>- Get anything from him before he was killed?
- No. But I got his last ten cellphone calls.</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:20.289
He called two numbers repeatedly.
We traced one of them to Marianne Taylor.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.457
You're under arrest.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.548
Don't move.
Drop the weapon!

01:31.717 --> 01:36.805
Listen carefully, Behrooz.
Government agents found me. I made a deal.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.516
<i>- I don't understand.
- You're going to be OK.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:42.019
I'm going to help them stop your father.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.979
You broke my heart.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.064
If you kill me,
Mother will tell them everything.

01:46.148 --> 01:49.359
If you don't believe me look outside.
They're coming to pick me up.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.738
- Drop the gun!
- You'll hit the boy.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.823
- Behrooz!
- Mom!

01:56.033 --> 02:00.662
That stairwell leads to the basement. He's got
to go down. Set up a link with CTU now!

02:00.746 --> 02:06.668
If you can't save my son,
I am happy to see the reactors melt down.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.669
Did you get that?

02:15.052 --> 02:16.470
<i>(phone rings)</i>

02:16.553 --> 02:18.430
<i>- Driscoll.
- Erin, it's Jack. </i>

02:18.514 --> 02:21.266
Araz is on the move.
We're ready to move in now.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.896
Dad, you're choking me.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.482
Jack, it's Jim. Bring us up to speed.

02:28.565 --> 02:32.945
We've a hostage situation involving
one of the men involved in the attacks.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.323
<i>(Erin) We're pulling up his ID now.</i>

02:36.406 --> 02:41.119
His name is Navi Araz. He was granted
American citizenship five years ago.

02:41.203 --> 02:44.373
- Who's the hostage?
- His 17-year-old son, Behrooz.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.000
He broke ranks.
Father sees him as a liability.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.169
Araz knows we have his wife.

02:49.253 --> 02:53.131
He's worried that if he kills the boy,
she'll cooperate with us.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.176
- What does she say?
- She'll help us find the override

02:56.260 --> 02:59.263
and stop the nuclear meltdowns
if we rescue her son.

02:59.346 --> 03:03.600
So the father'll stall and keep the kid alive
until the reactors blow.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.518
That's right.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.814
We already lost one in California.
Can we trust this woman to help us?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.650
She'll do everything she can
to protect her son.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.862
OK. Whatever you need, you got.
Just get that kid.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.115
Erin, I need a thermal
satellite scan of the building.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.202
We're looking for two heat sources
in remote areas of the basement.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.706
- I'll call you as soon as we have something.
- Yeah.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.458
You're running out of time. Save my son.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.379
Bring her with us. We're gonna need her.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.343
I said get on the floor.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.852
You're not my son.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.855
Why? Because I don't
want to kill innocent people?

03:49.938 --> 03:53.984
Because you're weak,
and you stand for nothing!

03:55.027 --> 03:57.362
I always saw you as something more.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.114
And now...

04:00.574 --> 04:03.035
I don't even recognise you.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.747
Will that make it easier for you to kill me?

04:16.464 --> 04:18.716
- Yes, it's me.
- Did you find your son?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.135
Yes.

04:20.219 --> 04:23.180
<i>- Is he dead?
- Not yet.</i>

04:23.263 --> 04:25.390
Is there a problem, Navi?

04:25.474 --> 04:29.228
Government agents arrested Dina
and surrounded the building.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.481
I need the boy for leverage,
but I'm not sure I can hold them off.

04:32.564 --> 04:36.443
- Has Dina told them anything?
- I don't think so.

04:36.527 --> 04:40.030
And she won't, as long as I don't kill the boy.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.575
How much more time
do you need to melt down the plants?

04:43.659 --> 04:47.412
- One hour, maybe two.
- Why? Why so long?

04:47.496 --> 04:50.499
They have programmers
trying to prevent meltdown.

04:50.582 --> 04:54.545
We have to manipulate each plant
individually, and that takes time.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.965
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.299
I know you will.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.228
<i>(phone rings)</i>

05:11.311 --> 05:14.273
<i>- Yeah?
- (Erin) We've found Araz and his son. </i>

05:14.356 --> 05:17.568
We have two readings
in the north wing of the basement.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.403
<i>- What's there?
- Laundry room.</i>

05:19.486 --> 05:23.240
- How many ways in?
- One, but there's a laundry chute.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.910
- Is it accessible?
- From the third floor.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.497
OK. We're on our way.
We got him. He's in the laundry room.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.959
I need two teams to the north wing.
Set up a hard perimeter.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.629
<i>- I need a fast line and a rappelling harness.
- Copy that. </i>

05:37.713 --> 05:40.215
Lee, get me Dina Araz.

05:40.299 --> 05:43.594
<i>- We're putting her into play.
- Got it. </i>

05:47.931 --> 05:50.767
Where are the latest timing estimates?

05:50.851 --> 05:53.270
Right here.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.315
These are from 40 minutes ago.
They update every 15.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.567
I'm sorry. I'm upset about my mother.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.028
You have to put your emotions on hold.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.739
- We're in a crisis.
- My mother just died.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.991
I can't put that on hold.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.662
I'm sorry, that was callous of me.

06:11.830 --> 06:17.836
But I'm really depending on you now, Edgar.
Please come through for me.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.549
- I'll get those figures as soon as we're done.
- Thank you.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.510
Bring me up to speed.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.889
- We're trying to hold off the meltdowns.
- How's that going?

06:28.972 --> 06:33.101
Our programmers can slow it down,
but they won't be able to stop it.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.521
We still have to find the override.

06:35.604 --> 06:40.817
Jack has a suspect cornered in a medical
facility, and we're fairly certain that this man

06:40.901 --> 06:42.903
is a key architect in today's events.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.780
- Can we take him alive?
- Unknown.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.449
- Marianne Taylor?
- Curtis is interrogating her.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.302
- I want to call my lawyer.
- Really?

07:07.386 --> 07:09.930
- I do have rights.
- Yeah?

07:12.140 --> 07:14.643
Henry Powell had rights too.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.480
I don't know any Henry Powell.

07:18.564 --> 07:22.693
The one who helped
the terrorists obtain the override.

07:23.235 --> 07:26.405
He's right here. Want to say hello?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.871
Bring him in.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.843
God, you're sick. Sick bastard.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.804
- CTU didn't kill him.
- Well, then, who did?

07:50.888 --> 07:53.807
The people who planted
the bomb under your car.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.268
They've caught up with you.

07:56.351 --> 08:00.189
Even if we let you go,
you'd be dead in 15 minutes.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.863
Get him out of here.

08:15.204 --> 08:19.833
Your only chance to survive
is to tell us what you know.

08:19.917 --> 08:24.463
- I want a deal.
- You get to live. That's your deal.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.552
All right.

08:30.636 --> 08:35.474
- Who did you and Powell work for?
- I don't know. I only dealt with him.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.976
Why'd he send you into CTU?

08:38.059 --> 08:40.520
To cover his tracks
if it became necessary.

08:40.604 --> 08:44.900
And after Audrey Raines saw him
at the warehouse it became necessary?

08:44.983 --> 08:45.817
Yes.

08:45.901 --> 08:49.571
Did he work directly for the terrorists?
Or someone associated?

08:49.655 --> 08:54.409
- I told you, I don't know.
- I need names who can get us to the override.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.662
I don't have any names.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.001
- But I can get 'em for you.
- How?

09:04.795 --> 09:10.133
Powell kept a file on his computer
in his office downtown. It was a...

09:10.217 --> 09:15.138
An insurance policy, in case either of us
ever needed a bargaining chip.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.475
- Give me the code.
- It can't be accessed externally.

09:18.559 --> 09:24.314
It requires a thumbprint identification,
either his or mine.

09:24.398 --> 09:28.819
Since he's dead, it'll have to be mine.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.575
<i>- (Tony) All right, you set?
- ( Jack) Yeah.</i>

09:34.658 --> 09:36.535
- We've found them.
- Where?

09:36.618 --> 09:39.872
Laundry room. Our satellite
picked up two thermal images.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.082
- Then Behrooz is still alive?
- Yes.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.418
I need you to distract your husband.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.629
I'll take you to the basement.
You'll call your husband,

09:47.713 --> 09:50.883
- keep him on the line as long as possible.
- All right.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.926
Let's go.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.099
<i>( Jack) OK.</i>

10:01.185 --> 10:03.061
- You ready?
- Ready.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.611
OK. Keep going.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.487
Six feet.

10:12.571 --> 10:13.906
Four feet.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.325
Three feet... Stop.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.454
All right, come here.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.667
OK. Make the call.

10:25.751 --> 10:29.505
And remember,
keep him on as long as you can.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.011
<i>(phone rings)</i>

10:39.723 --> 10:41.975
<i>- Yes?
- It's Dina. </i>

10:43.060 --> 10:45.187
- Where are you?
- In the hospital.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.773
<i>- What have you told them?
- Nothing. </i>

10:47.856 --> 10:51.235
And I'll keep my mouth shut
if you release our son.

10:51.318 --> 10:55.197
- You know I can't do that.
- At least promise me you won't kill him.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.950
<i>Navi, please. He's our son. </i>

10:58.033 --> 11:01.119
You turned him against me.
Our sacrifice is nothing

11:01.203 --> 11:04.748
compared to the martyrs
who have given all for our cause.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.543
No. He can still be of service.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.295
<i>- Is he still alive?
- Yes. </i>

11:11.004 --> 11:14.591
And he will remain alive
as long as you remain silent.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.885
How am I to trust you now?

11:16.969 --> 11:20.848
We planned this mission together.
We thought it out with one mind.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.183
But you betrayed me. Don't tell me that!

11:23.267 --> 11:26.770
I have visual on the suspect.
The boy is still alive.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.064
I'm ready to proceed. Go.

11:33.569 --> 11:38.949
<i>(Navi) Your conspiracy with him is over.
I won't allow you to continue it in front of me.</i>

11:39.032 --> 11:44.121
The boy is all I have, the only thing that
keeps them from storming through that door.

11:44.204 --> 11:48.625
Of course it's true. But in the end,
he'll wind up a martyr just the same...

11:48.709 --> 11:51.587
Slowly retract the rig. I'm in position.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.630
<i>(Navi)... you'll suffer even worse.</i>

11:53.714 --> 11:57.467
You'll have to live knowing
that everything you loved is dead.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.803
Your son, your brother...

12:00.762 --> 12:03.891
Yes. Your brother too...

12:03.974 --> 12:05.809
<i>(clang)</i>

12:11.481 --> 12:14.193
Don't move.

12:36.507 --> 12:40.177
Get up slowly.
Put your hands on your head.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.513
Stay with her.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.015
Put your hands on your...

12:46.475 --> 12:49.645
Hostiles engaged!
I repeat, hostiles engaged!

13:01.532 --> 13:04.952
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.371
Now get up, slowly.

13:18.549 --> 13:21.510
Interlock your fingers.

13:34.106 --> 13:37.860
It's OK, son. Just put the gun down.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.404
It's over.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.116
It's over.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.080
Drop the gun!

13:50.247 --> 13:52.374
Drop the gun!

13:52.457 --> 13:55.252
Please, son, put the gun down.

14:02.885 --> 14:06.513
Hands on your head.
Turn around.

14:09.099 --> 14:12.269
<i>(man) Yeah, copy that. Move in now. </i>

14:14.021 --> 14:16.356
Behrooz, are you all right?

14:16.440 --> 14:19.484
I killed him. I did it, I killed Father.

14:19.568 --> 14:22.529
Your son is safe.
He's alive. We did what you asked.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.449
- Now where is the override?
- I don't know that.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.827
I have an address where
work behind the attacks was done.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.038
That's not the deal we made.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.041
That's all I know.
I can only tell you what I know.

14:34.124 --> 14:38.587
- What's the address?
- 24878 Alvert Street.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.756
- What's there?
- It was a drop-off,

14:40.839 --> 14:43.258
the place we got our final assignments.

14:43.342 --> 14:47.721
It was the last place I saw the men
who took possession of the override.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.891
- When was that?
- Yesterday.

14:51.433 --> 14:55.020
Send in a team. Tell them
to set up a perimeter. No one goes in.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.980
<i>- (Lee) You got it.
- These two?</i>

14:57.064 --> 15:01.318
Until we know she's not lying,
they come with us.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.878
So this Marianne Taylor claims
she has to access the file personally?

15:19.962 --> 15:23.173
- Yes, she does.
- And do you believe her?

15:24.216 --> 15:29.221
I'm not sure. The polygraph
indicates that she's telling the truth.

15:29.304 --> 15:32.683
But in my opinion, she may be a sociopath.

15:33.225 --> 15:38.021
- Are you a psychologist?
- No. But I have had dealings with her before.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.899
Dealings that might affect your judgment?

15:40.983 --> 15:43.777
- No.
- We have to check it out. Question is, how?

15:43.861 --> 15:47.990
I can spare an operative from
the cyber unit, and a security team.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.117
- What do you think?
- Curtis should go.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.537
- I need Curtis here.
- The computer file may be important.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.874
Someone with experience
needs to examine it firsthand.

15:56.957 --> 16:01.503
I agree. Send Curtis with a security team.

16:01.587 --> 16:05.174
You'll have to figure out
how to do without him till he gets back.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.134
Yes, sir.

16:12.931 --> 16:17.060
- I don't like this.
- Neither do I, but those are our orders.

16:17.144 --> 16:20.689
- Get it done and get back quick as you can.
- OK.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.700
You OK?

16:32.784 --> 16:35.579
Anything you need?

16:35.662 --> 16:38.123
I'm fine.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.418
You understand, Sarah, I had no choice.

16:41.502 --> 16:47.508
You were identified as a threat
to security and I acted accordingly.

16:47.591 --> 16:52.012
- I would've hoped you had more faith in me.
- Personally, I do.

16:52.095 --> 16:56.600
But the evidence was brought to me by
the secretary of defense, I couldn't ignore it.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.896
- So what happens now?
- You can go home and rest.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.191
No one would blame you if you did.

17:04.273 --> 17:09.404
But if you're up to it,
I could use you on the floor.

17:09.488 --> 17:13.867
The San Gabriel Island reactor
went into meltdown less than an hour ago.

17:13.951 --> 17:19.998
The five remaining plants are critical.
I need my best people in play.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.837
I'll go back to work.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.588
Thank you, Sarah.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.599
It shouldn't be too complicated.
Security is light.

17:37.683 --> 17:41.228
- I have a key card for Powell's office.
- How long will it take?

17:41.311 --> 17:43.397
Five minutes to download the data.

17:43.480 --> 17:48.110
- We're looking at a 15-minute operation?
- Approximately.

17:48.193 --> 17:52.447
If I think you're stalling,
taking longer than you should,

17:52.531 --> 17:55.325
I will take action. You got that?

17:57.661 --> 17:59.830
Raise your leg.

18:00.873 --> 18:03.750
Don't make me do it for you.

18:09.214 --> 18:14.386
- Curtis, I'm not gonna run.
- Then you won't mind wearing it.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.765
Can I put my foot down now?

18:18.849 --> 18:20.142
Yes.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.649
Look, I realise that after today
you have a hard time trusting me,

18:27.733 --> 18:31.403
- but to pull this off you have to...
- I don't have to do anything.

18:31.486 --> 18:36.575
Except retrieve the data your boyfriend hid,
and put you in jail for treason.

18:36.658 --> 18:40.454
- Is that what you really want?
- Without a doubt.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.830
Curtis...

18:41.914 --> 18:43.999
Get your hand off me.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.389
I spoke with Mike at the DOD office.

18:59.473 --> 19:02.267
Who do you want to bring in
to help with their load?

19:02.351 --> 19:05.854
Things are too unstable for me to leave here.

19:05.938 --> 19:09.691
I checked with their logs
and they're gonna need someone soon.

19:09.775 --> 19:15.072
- How are you holding up?
- I can handle it, if that's what you mean.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.742
Dad, it'll be fine.

19:19.493 --> 19:24.998
- Why don't you head over there then?
- OK. I'll call you from there.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.510
- Sarah, you're back.
- Yeah.

19:36.593 --> 19:41.390
- I heard some rumours about what...
- I'll be all right. Just bring me up to speed.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.434
Sure. We're still trying to find the override.

19:44.518 --> 19:48.897
- It's the only way to stop the meltdowns.
- What have you got out of Marianne?

19:48.981 --> 19:52.192
She has access to a computer
with data about the override.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.903
- Which computer?
- She's taking Curtis to it.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.906
- They let her out?
- He's got a security team with him.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.701
- And we trust her?
- She's trying to cut a deal.

20:00.784 --> 20:04.663
Curtis can take care of her.
We need to support Jack.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.305
- Agent Bauer? Agent Solarz.
- Agent Almeida.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.183
- Set your perimeter?
- Nothing is going anywhere.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.851
- Any activity?
- No.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.103
OK. I want to keep this surgical.

20:28.187 --> 20:31.273
We'll be the insertion team.
Your men maintain backup.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.442
- You ready?
- Yeah.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.584
Go.

20:54.922 --> 20:57.758
We're clear!

20:58.967 --> 21:02.721
- Dina must have lied.
- I don't think so. She wants to save her son.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.015
Then they've cleared this place out.

21:05.098 --> 21:08.268
Bring in a forensics team now.
I want fingerprints.

21:08.352 --> 21:09.770
Yes, sir.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.911
Tony?

21:25.994 --> 21:28.080
What is it?

22:02.531 --> 22:03.574
Go.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.754
It's clear.

22:35.022 --> 22:38.483
That's the train they attacked this morning.

22:42.988 --> 22:47.784
So that's how the terrorists
got ahold of the override.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.798
Jack?

23:13.143 --> 23:15.562
They planned the kidnapping here.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.731
Yeah.

23:32.996 --> 23:36.917
The location Jack is searching
isn't on any agency watch list.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.461
- Well, I'm having a hell of a time.
- Why?

23:39.545 --> 23:45.300
The building's owned by a company owned
by another company that's owned by an LLC.

23:54.893 --> 23:59.523
Wait, hold on. Galaxy Financial?
I've heard that name before.

23:59.606 --> 24:03.819
No. I want that in a separate file.
We'll handle the kidnap another day.

24:03.902 --> 24:06.697
I only want things pertinent to the override.

24:06.780 --> 24:09.908
<i>- (Hal) OK, I'll have it up on the system. 
- OK, thanks.</i>

24:09.992 --> 24:12.327
<i>- I need to talk to you...
- (phone rings)</i>

24:12.411 --> 24:15.247
I'm sorry. Just give me a minute.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.792
<i>- Yeah?
-  Jack, this is Sarah from CTU.</i>

24:18.876 --> 24:21.587
I got something on that address
you gave to Edgar.

24:21.670 --> 24:25.090
- What is it?
- Ownership of the building is complicated,

24:25.174 --> 24:27.509
but I recognise one of the corporations.

24:27.593 --> 24:29.720
- Which one?
- Galaxy Financial.

24:29.803 --> 24:32.890
<i>- Never heard of it. 
- Neither did I until this afternoon.</i>

24:32.973 --> 24:35.392
When Paul Raines came in I ran his clearance.

24:35.475 --> 24:39.313
- What does he have to do with the company?
- He's a general partner.

24:39.396 --> 24:43.692
Audrey's husband owns the building
used to plan this morning's attacks?

24:43.775 --> 24:46.778
- According to this, yes.
- Where's Audrey now?

24:46.862 --> 24:51.116
<i>- She's on her way over to DOD.
- Patch her through to me.</i>

24:52.659 --> 24:54.745
<i>(phone rings)</i>

24:56.330 --> 24:59.041
- Yeah?
- This is Sarah from CTU. I've got Jack.

24:59.124 --> 25:01.877
<i>- Hold, please. 
- All right.</i>

25:05.130 --> 25:07.382
<i>- (Sarah) You're on. 
- Audrey, it's me.</i>

25:07.466 --> 25:12.054
- Hey. Did you find anything?
- The building was used to plan the attacks.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.597
That's a great find.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.308
- There's something else.
- What?

25:16.391 --> 25:19.061
The company that owns the building...

25:19.144 --> 25:21.188
Galaxy Financial.
Ever heard of them?

25:21.271 --> 25:26.485
- No. Should I have?
- Your husband's the chief financial officer.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.654
What?

25:29.947 --> 25:34.409
- I need to find Paul now.
- Paul had nothing to do with the kidnapping.

25:34.493 --> 25:37.287
Maybe not.
But his name's all over the paperwork,

25:37.371 --> 25:41.041
and because of his relationship
to your father he has to explain.

25:41.124 --> 25:44.711
I don't know where he is.
He left CTU without saying anything.

25:44.795 --> 25:46.672
- Can you reach him?
- Yeah.

25:46.755 --> 25:50.092
- I have his cellphone number.
- Call him, keep it personal.

25:50.175 --> 25:51.802
Don't tell him what I know.

25:51.885 --> 25:54.388
I just want you to tell me where he is.

25:56.056 --> 26:00.602
Five power plants could still melt down.
If Paul has any information,

26:00.686 --> 26:04.606
we have to follow through with it.
You know that.

26:05.649 --> 26:09.111
- All right.
- Please get back to me as soon as you can.

26:09.194 --> 26:10.362
OK, I will.

26:24.418 --> 26:26.503
<i>(phone rings)</i>

26:34.595 --> 26:37.139
- Hello?
- Hey.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.891
Paul, it's Audrey.

26:38.974 --> 26:42.102
<i>- Wasn't expecting to hear from you.
- I know. I just... </i>

26:42.186 --> 26:45.355
Look, I didn't like the way
we left things between us.

26:45.439 --> 26:48.984
I didn't care for it much either. Look, uh...

26:49.067 --> 26:52.404
I'm glad you called,
but I'm about to check out.

26:52.487 --> 26:57.075
- Where are you going?
- What difference does it make?

26:57.159 --> 27:03.248
Look, I was thinking about what you said,
how we've got so much going on for us.

27:03.332 --> 27:07.461
- I thought you wanted a divorce.
- Yeah, I thought so too, but I just...

27:07.544 --> 27:13.467
You know, Paul, today was the first time
that we've seen each other in months, and...

27:13.550 --> 27:17.137
I don't know, maybe it took
a while for it to sink in.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.265
Maybe you're right.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.144
Maybe there is something there.

27:24.228 --> 27:27.314
You know this is what I want,
more than anything.

27:27.397 --> 27:29.274
<i>Then let me come over. </i>

27:29.358 --> 27:34.112
I don't want to have the most important
conversation of my life over the phone.

27:34.196 --> 27:37.616
<i>OK. I'm at the Westmore Hotel, room 408.</i>

27:38.116 --> 27:42.788
- All right. I'll be there soon.
- Good. I'll wait for you.

27:46.625 --> 27:52.422
No one goes down there till the forensic team
get here. When they do, I want fingerprints,

27:52.506 --> 27:54.842
trace DNA, fibre samples, everything.

27:54.925 --> 27:57.010
- I understand.
- OK.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.099
Hey.

28:02.182 --> 28:05.018
I need to follow up a lead on my own.
I need a favour.

28:05.102 --> 28:09.231
I need you to take Dina and her son
back to CTU and head the interrogation.

28:09.314 --> 28:12.609
They'd never let me set foot in CTU,
even if I wanted to.

28:12.693 --> 28:15.529
Listen to me.
You're the only one I can trust.

28:15.612 --> 28:18.824
Last two hours, I've watched
my friend come back to life.

28:18.907 --> 28:22.077
- It's not that simple, Jack.
- I can get you reinstated.

28:22.161 --> 28:26.456
But I need to know now,
is that what you want?

28:26.540 --> 28:28.625
I don't know.

28:31.879 --> 28:34.256
Maybe I was wrong.

28:37.259 --> 28:44.141
You saved the daughter of the secretary of
defense, my boss. You do know that, right?

28:46.643 --> 28:48.729
Jack.

28:51.857 --> 28:54.193
Thanks.

28:54.276 --> 28:56.778
I'll do it.

28:56.862 --> 28:58.447
Lee.

28:58.530 --> 29:03.410
<i>- Agent Almeida will be driving your car.
- (phone rings)</i>

29:05.704 --> 29:07.956
- Yeah?
- Jack, I spoke with Paul.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.960
He's at the Westmore downtown, room 408.
I'm heading over there now.

29:12.044 --> 29:16.673
Let us handle this. We don't know Paul's
connection yet. He could be dangerous.

29:16.757 --> 29:21.178
He was on his way out the door. I had
to make something up to keep him there.

29:21.261 --> 29:25.432
- Fine. I can get there instead.
- I'm only minutes away, and he knows that.

29:25.516 --> 29:28.101
He's not gonna stick around if I don't show.

29:28.185 --> 29:31.897
Audrey, I don't feel comfortable
with you going in alone.

29:31.980 --> 29:35.776
Jack, he won't suspect.
He wants to talk about the marriage.

29:35.859 --> 29:40.906
<i>- Look, I'll keep him there until you get there. 
- No. It's not an option.</i>

29:40.989 --> 29:43.909
- Jack, just get there as soon as you can.
- Audrey.

29:43.992 --> 29:45.702
Audrey!

30:04.388 --> 30:06.473
I just got off the phone with Jack.

30:06.557 --> 30:10.519
He wants Almeida reinstated.
Do you have a problem with that?

30:10.602 --> 30:14.398
Considering what he's done today,
I have no problem with that.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.942
- Good.
- Sir, you said you spoke with Jack?

30:17.025 --> 30:20.821
- How long ago was that?
- 10, 15 minutes ago. Why?

30:20.904 --> 30:24.074
We have some new information
I'd like to share with you.

30:24.158 --> 30:28.829
- We found a connection to the terrorists.
- What kind of connection?

30:28.912 --> 30:32.249
- Paul Raines.
- My daughter's husband?

30:32.332 --> 30:36.003
One of his companies owns
the building Jack just searched.

30:36.086 --> 30:39.923
- The building they planned the attack from?
- That's the one.

30:40.007 --> 30:44.511
- Has anybody gone to pick him up?
- We have teams on the way to his hotel,

30:44.595 --> 30:48.515
but he was about to leave.
We kept him there under a false pretence.

30:48.599 --> 30:50.934
False pretence? What's that mean?

30:51.018 --> 30:55.314
Jack told us that Audrey's meeting Paul
in his room. Jack's on his way over.

30:55.397 --> 30:59.234
- What?
- She'll keep him there till backup takes over.

30:59.318 --> 31:02.029
Unacceptable!
How could you let this happen?

31:02.112 --> 31:05.616
This was her choice.
Jack did everything he could to stop her.

31:05.699 --> 31:08.702
- When did you find out about this?
- Five minutes ago.

31:08.785 --> 31:11.288
That's when you should have told me.

31:15.918 --> 31:20.339
<i>- (man) Want me to look into it?
- Yeah. Find out.</i>

31:20.422 --> 31:24.051
- Tell me what you know about Paul Raines.
- Why?

31:24.134 --> 31:28.597
- What's his connection to all this?
- How should I know?

31:29.431 --> 31:33.602
Look, Curtis, I wish I knew
something that you could use.

31:33.685 --> 31:37.147
Believe me, I'm quite clear
it's my only way out of this.

31:37.231 --> 31:41.902
But I don't know any more
about Paul Raines than you do.

31:44.905 --> 31:48.784
- How much longer?
- We're about five minutes out.

31:49.827 --> 31:53.580
Raines' part in all this
is being investigated as we speak.

31:53.664 --> 31:58.126
- If your name turns up linked to the kidnap...
- It won't.

31:58.210 --> 32:02.548
I'll do everything I can to find something
on Powell's computer to help you.

32:02.631 --> 32:07.094
Maybe something about
Paul Raines will be on there.

32:13.684 --> 32:15.602
<i>(phone rings)</i>

32:16.645 --> 32:20.107
<i>- (Audrey) Yeah?
- (Heller) You're seeing Paul by yourself?</i>

32:20.190 --> 32:23.861
- It's the only way to keep him here.
- If Paul was involved...

32:23.944 --> 32:29.074
- Look, Paul would never hurt me.
- Strong evidence suggests he was involved,

32:29.158 --> 32:31.451
which means he is dangerous.

32:31.535 --> 32:35.205
- Look, I don't believe he is.
- You don't know what he is, Audrey.

32:35.289 --> 32:37.791
I lived with him for eight years. I know him.

32:37.875 --> 32:41.837
Yeah, I thought I knew him too.
Audrey, I forbid you to do this.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.007
Dad, I'm sorry, I'm already here.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.147
- Mr Almeida.
- That's right.

33:01.398 --> 33:04.651
- Erin Driscoll, director of CTU.
- How are you?

33:04.735 --> 33:10.032
This is Mrs Araz, and her son Behrooz.
Mrs Araz needs medical attention.

33:10.115 --> 33:12.326
Take care of it, then interrogate them.

33:12.409 --> 33:16.288
- We've told you everything.
- We'll see.

33:17.623 --> 33:19.958
You're going to need these.

33:21.919 --> 33:25.172
- I'm sure you're aware of my history here.
- Not an issue.

33:25.255 --> 33:30.052
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller
both vouch for you. That's enough for me.

33:30.135 --> 33:35.599
All right. Thank you. Jack thought it'd be
a good idea if I headed up the interrogation.

33:35.682 --> 33:40.395
That makes sense. You've had
the chance to observe them firsthand.

33:40.479 --> 33:43.023
If there's anything you need, let me know.

33:54.076 --> 33:56.829
That man I was just
talking to is Tony Almeida.

33:56.912 --> 34:01.917
Keep an eye on him, let me know if he goes
off protocol. I'm particularly interested...

34:02.000 --> 34:05.504
In communication between him
and Jack or Secretary Heller.

34:05.587 --> 34:07.673
That's right.

34:08.715 --> 34:13.594
- I'm seeing how things work around here.
- How do things work around here?

34:13.679 --> 34:17.349
You can care less about
me being falsely accused and tortured.

34:17.431 --> 34:22.145
You feel squeezed out, and you need allies.
That's why you were so nice to me.

34:22.228 --> 34:27.985
We're facing a crisis today, Sarah. And our
first priority is to deal with it successfully.

34:28.068 --> 34:31.864
- Is that a problem for you?
- Not at all.

34:31.947 --> 34:36.368
But after what I went through today,
if you want help, I need something too.

34:36.451 --> 34:39.913
- And what's that?
- I want my arrest expunged.

34:39.996 --> 34:44.418
Not explained by an official
letter in my file, expunged.

34:44.501 --> 34:47.963
And I want a promotion. Two pay grades.

34:50.090 --> 34:52.176
Done.

34:58.432 --> 35:00.517
<i>(knocking)</i>

35:09.610 --> 35:11.695
Come on in.

35:16.241 --> 35:19.203
I'm glad you came.

35:19.286 --> 35:22.247
- Can I get you something?
- Sure.

35:23.540 --> 35:27.211
I had them send up
your favourite champagne.

35:28.337 --> 35:32.216
Tell you the truth,
I wasn't sure you'd really come.

35:32.299 --> 35:36.136
- Why wouldn't I?
- You were so adamant about ending things.

35:36.220 --> 35:40.849
Your turnaround was just
a little surprising, that's all.

35:46.104 --> 35:49.650
How about you? I hardly hear
from you for about six months,

35:49.733 --> 35:53.987
then you see me with another man
and you're pouring Dom Perignon?

35:54.071 --> 35:58.450
Shows what a fool I am
for not realising what I had.

35:58.534 --> 36:02.454
It also shows that
I still have feelings for you.

36:03.497 --> 36:09.628
And you must have some for me, too.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?

36:11.255 --> 36:17.135
I would hate to think that you were
playing some kind of game with me.

36:17.219 --> 36:20.430
- I don't play games, Paul.
- Good.

36:26.186 --> 36:29.147
To new beginnings.

36:29.231 --> 36:31.316
New beginnings.

36:59.261 --> 37:02.681
Miss Driscoll? It's Jack on line three.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.017
Jack?

37:05.100 --> 37:08.562
- Backup teams at the Westmore yet?
- No, they're in traffic.

37:08.645 --> 37:13.525
I'm still a couple miles out. If your teams
get there first, tell them not to waste time.

37:13.609 --> 37:15.486
I want them in that room.

37:15.569 --> 37:18.739
Why not put some fibre optics in,
get a better position?

37:18.822 --> 37:23.368
If Paul's involved, he'll be nervous.
I don't want anything to tip him off.

37:23.452 --> 37:27.831
- I don't want Audrey in any more danger.
- OK. I'll pass that along to Tactical.

37:27.915 --> 37:32.711
<i>- Has Curtis questioned Marianne about Paul?
- She says she doesn't know anything. </i>

37:32.794 --> 37:35.714
But they're about
to get into the computer files.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.883
OK. Thanks, Erin.

37:39.426 --> 37:42.596
It's right down this hall and to the left.

37:44.890 --> 37:48.560
Stay alert.
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

37:48.644 --> 37:52.022
- What? You think this is some kind of trap?
- Yes. I do.

37:52.105 --> 37:58.362
Like you said, Curtis, this is my only chance
to stay alive. I'm not gonna blow it. So relax.

38:20.008 --> 38:22.094
<i>(man) It's all clear.</i>

38:46.952 --> 38:50.164
This'll only take one minute.

38:57.129 --> 39:03.302
Here it is. All I have to do is reformat and then
we can download the data and get out of here.

39:07.264 --> 39:10.225
- Oh.
- What?

39:10.309 --> 39:13.061
- The file has a second password.
- Do you know it?

39:13.145 --> 39:15.439
I think so.

39:15.522 --> 39:17.816
But it's strange.

39:25.824 --> 39:27.993
Get your hand away from the gun.

39:28.994 --> 39:31.788
Take it away.

39:33.290 --> 39:35.667
The files are still secure.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.296
I- I didn't give them anything. I...

39:42.549 --> 39:44.843
Now put the gun down.

39:52.684 --> 39:54.561
Put it down.

40:08.742 --> 40:11.745
Your name is Curtis Manning.
You work for CTU.

40:11.829 --> 40:15.541
Tell me how far along
you are in your investigation.

40:15.624 --> 40:18.126
- What investigation?
- Of the override.

40:18.210 --> 40:20.420
Have they discovered where it is yet?

40:20.504 --> 40:26.301
You're an American, and you're working
with the terrorists? Who are you?

40:26.385 --> 40:29.513
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

40:29.596 --> 40:32.850
What does CTU know about the override?

40:36.270 --> 40:37.855
Fine.

41:02.004 --> 41:05.215
<i>(Paul) Or I could move to Washington.</i>

41:07.759 --> 41:12.347
I could turn West Coast operations
over to Ben Simon.

41:14.725 --> 41:16.310
Audrey.

41:16.393 --> 41:20.647
Yes, I heard you. Turn West Coast
operations over to Ben Simon.

41:20.731 --> 41:23.442
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

41:23.525 --> 41:26.278
You'd have to decide whether or not he was...

41:26.361 --> 41:30.199
Not Ben Simon.
What do you think of me moving back east?

41:30.282 --> 41:32.701
Oh, um...

41:32.784 --> 41:35.787
Well, I, um... I don't know.

41:41.126 --> 41:46.465
I feel like I'm doing all the work here. You said
you wanted to talk. You're not talking.

41:46.548 --> 41:49.551
These things take time, Paul.

41:50.677 --> 41:55.015
Well, maybe talking
isn't what we should be doing.

41:59.686 --> 42:02.981
Why are you looking at me like that?

42:03.524 --> 42:08.695
- You're my wife, for God's sake.
- You can't believe I came to sleep with you.

42:08.779 --> 42:12.991
OK, you didn't come here to sleep with me
or to talk with me. Why did you come?

42:13.075 --> 42:18.330
I just... I thought that maybe we could
spend a little time together. It'd be nice.

42:18.413 --> 42:20.666
On a day like this?

42:20.749 --> 42:24.378
All hell's breaking loose
and you thought it'd be nice?

42:24.461 --> 42:27.256
I really wasn't thinking
when you called, was I?

42:27.339 --> 42:30.384
What's really going on?
What? Are you spying on me?

42:30.467 --> 42:34.179
- Are you doing something to spy on?
- What is that supposed to mean?

42:34.263 --> 42:38.809
- I just... I think I should go.
- I think you should stay.

42:38.892 --> 42:42.104
- Please just let me go, please, let me...
- No. No!

42:42.187 --> 42:44.106
Take your hands off of her!

42:44.189 --> 42:46.358
You set me up!

42:46.441 --> 42:49.987
Audrey, get behind me.
Put your hands on your head now.

42:50.070 --> 42:52.656
Now!

42:54.032 --> 42:58.704
- What do you want?
- I want answers.

43:00.164 --> 43:02.958
Well, I'm not talking to you.
