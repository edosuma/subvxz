a little bit jinxed.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.050
Jinxed?

18:54.092 --> 18:56.135
Daddy, I'm the kiss of death.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.854
Am I interrupting something?

19:06.896 --> 19:09.148
I don't wanna talk

19:06.896 --> 19:09.148
about it right now.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.317
I'd leave, but I can't

19:09.189 --> 19:11.317
reach the gate hook.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.405
Jesse, there is nothing

19:13.486 --> 19:16.405
you can do about your arms.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.157
But there's something you can

19:16.447 --> 19:18.157
do about Stephanie.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.534
What are you talking about?

19:20.576 --> 19:22.745
Steph is scared to death

19:20.576 --> 19:22.745
to go near you.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.246
She's afraid she's

19:22.787 --> 19:24.246
gonna hurt you again.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.499
Well, tell the little

19:24.288 --> 19:26.499
rug rat, she's wacko.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.211
I think you should tell the

19:28.542 --> 19:31.211
little rug rat, she's wacko.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.216
In maybe a little nicer way.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.181
You're right.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.181
Send her out here.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.559
Thanks.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.737
- Hey, babe.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.737
- Hi.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.865
You can come a little closer.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.243
I better not.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.079
I'm dangerous.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.165
That's why you hate me.

20:10.001 --> 20:14.296
Stephanie Judith Tanner,

20:10.001 --> 20:14.296
I do not hate you.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.632
Then why are you yelling

20:14.338 --> 20:16.632
and being so grouchy

20:16.674 --> 20:18.509
and telling daddy

20:16.674 --> 20:18.509
to slam doors?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.678
Well, because I'm<i> frustrated.</i>

20:23.181 --> 20:25.641
- You know what?

20:23.181 --> 20:25.641
- What?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.852
I've been feeling

20:25.683 --> 20:27.852
sorry for myself.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.813
And I've been acting

20:27.894 --> 20:30.813
like a baby.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.899
I didn't mean to blame you.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.608
I'm very sorry.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.443
You mean you're really

20:34.650 --> 20:36.443
not mad at me?

20:36.485 --> 20:37.778
No, I'm not..

20:37.820 --> 20:39.155
Stephanie, you made

20:37.820 --> 20:39.155
one little mistake.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.074
Everybody makes mistakes.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.408
Look, I'm an expert

20:41.115 --> 20:42.408
bike rider, right?

20:42.449 --> 20:43.868
I've never had one problem.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.453
I miss one little sign.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.453
Boom! I'm the mummy man.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.375
Same thing with you, how many

20:48.539 --> 20:51.375
pretend haircuts have you given?

20:51.417 --> 20:54.336
Counting yours..

20:54.378 --> 20:56.380
...a million.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.175
See, you're an expert too,

20:56.422 --> 20:59.175
but you made one little mistake.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.303
Stephanie, I promise, I'm gonna

21:00.676 --> 21:03.303
be as good as new. Okay?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.638
Okay.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.973
Alright, now,

21:04.680 --> 21:05.973
you get over here

21:06.015 --> 21:09.018
and you give me

21:06.015 --> 21:09.018
the world's biggest hug.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.104
Lay it on me, baby.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.235
What? Do I have

21:15.191 --> 21:17.235
the cooties or something?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.487
Come here, sit on my lap.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.866
Easy. Go ahead.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.866
There you go.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.410
Alright, now..

21:26.452 --> 21:27.912
...I'm gonna need your help.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.247
What do you mean?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.957
Well, since

21:29.288 --> 21:30.957
I can't play my music

21:30.998 --> 21:33.626
I was thinking on

21:30.998 --> 21:33.626
working on some lyrics.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.004
That is, if you could write

21:33.667 --> 21:37.004
them down for me.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.840
I could do that. If you write

21:37.046 --> 21:39.840
about dog, cat

21:39.882 --> 21:41.467
tree and Stephanie.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.388
- Can you spell baby?

21:44.137 --> 21:46.388
- B-A-B-Y.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.724
Good, then we have a hit.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.726
You know the best part

21:48.766 --> 21:50.726
about you helping me?

21:50.768 --> 21:52.145
What?

21:52.186 --> 21:54.521
I get to spend more

21:52.186 --> 21:54.521
time with my little buddy.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.024
I'm so glad you

21:54.563 --> 21:57.024
broke your arms.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.070
- Hey.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.070
- Hey, what?

22:01.112 --> 22:03.489
You're hugging me,

22:01.112 --> 22:03.489
and I'm, uh, not even hurting.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.575
You're right.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.575
The curse is broken!

22:06.617 --> 22:09.287
(both)

22:06.617 --> 22:09.287
Have mercy!

22:11.580 --> 22:15.417
Thank you. Thank you.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.710
Alright.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.504
So, what do you think

22:16.752 --> 22:18.504
of my new haircut?

22:18.545 --> 22:21.715
- Better than Garry Shandling's?

22:18.545 --> 22:21.715
- No.

22:21.757 --> 22:25.011
- Alright, how about Don King's?

22:21.757 --> 22:25.011
- No.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.721
Thanks, I feel a lot better.

22:27.763 --> 22:31.309
Michelle, I've had

22:27.763 --> 22:31.309
a lot of time to think.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.644
Because let's face it,

22:31.349 --> 22:33.644
there's not much else I can do.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.691
You know how I'm always saying

22:36.022 --> 22:38.691
that things happen for a reason?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.611
Well, maybe the reason

22:40.567 --> 22:42.611
all this is happening to me

22:42.653 --> 22:46.907
is because it's time to make

22:42.653 --> 22:46.907
some changes in my life.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.909
You know about change,

22:46.949 --> 22:48.909
don't you, Michelle?

22:50.286 --> 22:52.288
You realize that ever

22:50.286 --> 22:52.288
since I've been 16 years old

22:52.330 --> 22:54.832
I've had the exact same haircut?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.334
I've ridden the same Harley.

22:56.374 --> 22:59.628
I've dressed the same.

22:56.374 --> 22:59.628
I've listened to the same music.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.006
Had the same boring

22:59.670 --> 23:02.006
job, killing bugs.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.135
You know for a guy who likes

23:03.674 --> 23:06.135
to live his life on the edge

23:06.177 --> 23:09.055
I've been living

23:06.177 --> 23:09.055
on the edge of a rut.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.515
No. You know

23:09.096 --> 23:11.515
something, Michelle?

23:11.557 --> 23:12.766
Starting right now

23:11.557 --> 23:12.766
I'm gonna start

23:12.808 --> 23:15.644
<i>shaking</i> my life

23:12.808 --> 23:15.644
up a little bit.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.855
Oh, what? You think

23:15.686 --> 23:17.855
I'm afraid to change?

23:19.023 --> 23:20.691
Oh, su..

23:19.023 --> 23:20.691
Oh, I get it.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.276
You think I'm caught up

23:20.733 --> 23:22.276
in this whole rebel thing

23:22.318 --> 23:24.653
and I refuse to grow up.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.072
From now on,

23:24.695 --> 23:26.072
I'm gonna be a lot more

23:26.113 --> 23:28.532
open to change.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.743
I'm gonna start acting

23:28.574 --> 23:30.743
like a mature adult.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.039
Joey!

23:36.874 --> 23:38.959
I need you!

23:39.793 --> 23:41.045
Again?

23:41.087 --> 23:43.214
Well, I had four

23:41.087 --> 23:43.214
glasses of ice tea.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.555
Okay, go on.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.683
[theme music]

24:17.164 --> 24:20.251
[music continues]
