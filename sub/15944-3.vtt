WEBVTT

00:04.133 --> 00:08.200
What did you ask that animal
to do? Claude needed to be protected.

00:08.233 --> 00:10.967
That's all I've ever done,
is protected him and you.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.867
Where do you think you'd be without him?

00:12.900 --> 00:16.433
- What does he know about us?
- He was interested in me.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.467
He knows all about us.

00:20.667 --> 00:23.933
I just wanted to let
you know it was taken care of.

00:23.967 --> 00:27.800
I don't need to know any more about
it, Victor. Neither does Paul. Ever.

00:27.833 --> 00:30.967
I'm proposing
that you do it again.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.333
This time, I'll pick the garments.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.000
But I'm not a model. Why not...

00:34.033 --> 00:36.433
You're no longer the little girl
sitting at Marianne's feet,

00:36.467 --> 00:39.033
making dolls out of spools.
You've grown up.

00:39.067 --> 00:40.533
Some scruffy Cinderella...

00:40.567 --> 00:43.167
out in the streets playing
dress-up in my clothes.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.367
This skirt could dress a dozen children.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.533
Why didn't you ask me
to wear these clothes?

00:49.567 --> 00:51.300
It looks like this was taken by me.

00:51.333 --> 00:54.167
But it's not possible. I gave
you all of the negatives.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.900
It must have been taken
by somebody else.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.300
We're done drawing on our stockings.

00:57.333 --> 01:00.600
Women want to feel
pampered, beautiful again.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.467
If your next collection
fails, Monsieur Sabine,

01:03.500 --> 01:05.900
our partnership is effectively over

01:05.933 --> 01:07.367
and you will owe me everything.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.167
Hello? Who's calling.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.500
Aren't you curious what this
guy was up to three years ago?

01:15.533 --> 01:19.067
It's a Bruchner, right? What have you
gotta do to get a gift like that?

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.867 --> 02:33.433
Oh, I love this one.

02:40.233 --> 02:42.067
Are you looking for Marc?

02:43.433 --> 02:45.633
How do you know my husband?

02:45.667 --> 02:48.733
Are you looking for Marc? You're
not in the Navy, are you?

02:52.700 --> 02:54.633
Kiss me.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.567
No, stop! Claude!

03:48.300 --> 03:50.867
- There...
- I took the neck down.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.767
It's very good otherwise.

03:59.467 --> 04:02.067
If we pin it on the back, maybe?

04:02.100 --> 04:05.267
Mm... It needs to be lifted.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.900
- Maybe more...
- Let's put another metre.

04:07.933 --> 04:10.067
- More fabric.
- Double up on the folds.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.833
Monsieur, your wife just arrived

04:11.867 --> 04:15.567
for your first meeting with the
parfumier, Monsieur Cassatt.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.725
And the marquis' daughter
is on her way over.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.433
Scissors.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.966
Another fitting. Her request.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.567
We have a very jumpy bride.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.400
- She wants Marianne to...
- Marianne's busy.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.846
Explain that we're five
weeks out from a show.

04:26.871 --> 04:27.667
I told her.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.333
Very nice.

04:37.067 --> 04:41.200
- Lovely.
- Hmm. Thank you, monsieur.

04:41.233 --> 04:45.300
Some of the girls have asked about the new
designs. They're eager to get started.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.567
They'll have the sketches
when they're ready.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.600
Are we waiting for Monsieur
Trouvier's approval?

04:49.633 --> 04:53.600
No. Monsieur Trouvier will see
them after they've been executed.

04:53.633 --> 04:57.767
That's the beauty of a
silent partner, Charlotte.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.600
They stay silent.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.067
Stan Rossi checking in.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.767
- Rossi?
- Hey.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.967
What are you doing here?
Why are you back in Paris?

05:13.067 --> 05:14.500
- I'm on a new assignment.
- You disappeared.

05:14.533 --> 05:17.667
I followed a story back to London,
then Berlin, then Vienna.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.500
What's wrong, kid? Did you miss me?

05:19.533 --> 05:21.900
-What's the new assignment?
-I'm back on the fashion trail.

05:21.933 --> 05:24.767
Doing a profile on Frederic Lemare.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.600
Sabine was his protégé, his
right-hand man, during the war.

05:28.633 --> 05:31.700
I thought writing about ball
gowns was a one-time punishment?

05:31.733 --> 05:33.133
So did I.

05:33.167 --> 05:36.500
But I heard Lemare's a tough old
tiger with a helluva story.

05:36.533 --> 05:38.900
Used to be head of the
Chambre Syndicale.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.200
Who asked for this?

05:40.233 --> 05:41.700
I know Life magazine
booted you because...

05:41.733 --> 05:44.700
Life magazine ain't the
only rag on the rack.

05:44.733 --> 05:46.533
I gotta go, kid.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.167
You left a book in your room.
There was a note inside.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.667
Who wrote that?

05:54.700 --> 05:56.267
The note.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.533
I don't recall any note.

06:00.567 --> 06:03.067
Well, I don't think
you'd forget this one.

06:03.967 --> 06:06.133
Stan, what is it with
you and this crusade

06:06.167 --> 06:07.833
to try and crack open Paul Sabine?

06:07.867 --> 06:10.500
There's no crusade, Billy.
I'm just a reporter.

06:10.533 --> 06:14.667
And a sucker for a story
with a few good twists.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.567
You can keep the book.
Couldn't finish it.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.800
Think I'm losing my
appetite for fiction.

06:26.367 --> 06:30.267
Wake up, Claude! You've got work to do!

06:30.300 --> 06:33.300
It's time to get up. Come on.
Up, up, up, up.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.467
Get up. Oh, get out!

06:38.700 --> 06:40.567
I was having a horrible dream.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.433
- Were you?
- Mmm.

06:43.467 --> 06:46.200
A potato with a mouth
was shouting at me.

06:46.233 --> 06:50.200
Charming. Find your trousers.

06:50.233 --> 06:52.433
Your brother's in a meeting
to produce a fragrance

06:52.467 --> 06:54.900
for the clothes you haven't
even designed yet.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.833
I'm confused.

06:58.867 --> 07:02.233
Is this dress from the new
collection or the last one?

07:04.267 --> 07:05.933
You have a splendid memory, my friend.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.833
Erm, I've asked Dominique and Elise
to model a few from last year

07:09.867 --> 07:13.200
to inspire and provide a
launching point for discussion.

07:13.233 --> 07:17.100
Wouldn't it be more inspiring
to see what's next?

07:18.367 --> 07:20.833
I could never pry those creations

07:20.867 --> 07:23.900
from my workers' hands. Not
while they're still alive.

07:23.933 --> 07:25.867
Seamstresses are quite possessive.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.800
They each treat the dress
they're working on

07:27.833 --> 07:30.533
as their precious baby and
they won't surrender it

07:30.567 --> 07:32.267
until they absolutely have to.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.367
Could you, er... at least share
the theme of this new collection?

07:37.533 --> 07:39.967
Who can I pry that from?

07:40.067 --> 07:41.633
It's... sensitive.

07:41.667 --> 07:46.600
If a theme is leaked and
other houses found out...

07:46.633 --> 07:50.567
Other houses have given me something
real to look at, my friend.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.600
That's my launching point to
design a signature scent.

07:54.633 --> 07:57.300
Pardon. Monsieur Cassatt, you
have a call from your office.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.567
Could you please tell
them I'm on my way back?

08:02.167 --> 08:06.433
Well, we can continue this later.

08:06.467 --> 08:09.867
I'm intrigued, but I wouldn't
want to force you to do anything

08:09.900 --> 08:13.700
that would make you, or your
workers, uncomfortable.

08:16.267 --> 08:18.500
Give my regards to your uncle, Helen.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.133
Tell him I'm feeling much lighter.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.767
That appendix was weighing me down.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.367
Thank you, girls.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.767
You could have walked upstairs and grabbed
one of the sketches from your desk.

08:33.799 --> 08:36.267
Really? The ones you scraped
out of Claude's rubbish?

08:36.299 --> 08:37.866
I taped them together.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.600
What message does that send?

08:39.633 --> 08:42.167
"I destroyed this, monsieur,
because it's absolutely shit

08:42.200 --> 08:44.167
"but perhaps you'll have
more confidence in it."

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
He's not a critic, Paul.
He's a businessman.

08:46.233 --> 08:47.967
So am I.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.733
Presentation is everything.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.533
We both know that.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.800
Hey. Have you seen Nina? I
really need to speak to her.

09:01.267 --> 09:03.066
- Do you need any help?
- Sure.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.700
Peel it off and put my
ribs back in place.

09:09.533 --> 09:12.567
Monsieur wants several of the
models to adopt the look.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.066
Short hair is so chic right now.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.933
For a child. My hair is my trademark.

09:17.967 --> 09:19.600
It's what gets me jobs.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.500
Not the hair on her head.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.133
Keep walking.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.200
I heard Monsieur had to
give him a transfusion.

09:45.233 --> 09:47.167
Isn't taking his money enough?

09:47.200 --> 09:48.933
What was it? A gambling debt?

09:48.967 --> 09:51.700
Sure. He bet on the wrong horse.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.700
- Ow!
- Sorry.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.467
Monsieur's back in his office.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.500
- We'll take his lift.
- Morning.

10:02.533 --> 10:04.533
Hey. Morning.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.467
I asked the front desk

10:14.500 --> 10:16.800
and nobody remembers anyone
stopping by to see...

10:16.833 --> 10:18.600
I wouldn't give
it too much thought.

10:18.633 --> 10:21.167
We still don't know how that
photo of Nina in the market

10:21.200 --> 10:22.833
ended up in the papers, and...

10:22.867 --> 10:25.300
You don't think your colleague
had anything to do with it?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.833
Maybe it's a stretch but...

10:27.867 --> 10:29.533
if he's suddenly back in Paris

10:29.567 --> 10:32.100
and he's doing this piece
on Frederic Lemare...

10:32.133 --> 10:35.567
Lemare's a worthy subject.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.333
The Germans tried to move the
couture industry to Berlin.

10:39.367 --> 10:42.367
Lemare fought to keep it in Paris.
And succeeded.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.033
I applaud any reporter
wanting to tell that story.

10:45.067 --> 10:47.133
Right, but someone sent that note...

10:47.167 --> 10:49.567
It's a vicious business, Billy.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.267
Couture houses live from
collection to collection.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.367
Your chances of survival are much higher

10:54.400 --> 10:56.600
if you can take down the competition.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.233
Our enemies are hoping to distract us.

11:01.167 --> 11:03.400
I... I'd still like to...
to question Rossi...

11:03.433 --> 11:05.133
Don't.

11:11.933 --> 11:16.067
I submitted that picture from
the market to the newspapers.

11:19.633 --> 11:22.933
It gave us more than a
thousand words, didn't it?

11:22.967 --> 11:24.467
I... I suppose.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.933
I probably should have
mentioned it to you before.

11:27.967 --> 11:30.233
No, I...

11:30.267 --> 11:33.700
It's your property, it's
your photo, your dress.

11:33.733 --> 11:37.333
You can do whatever you want with it.
I just, um...

11:37.367 --> 11:39.066
I do think Nina should know.

11:39.067 --> 11:42.567
I don't think that would be a
helpful thing for her to know.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.400
Don't you agree?

11:47.833 --> 11:49.400
No...

11:52.500 --> 11:56.367
Now, have you finished the
session with Dominique?

11:57.700 --> 11:59.833
Uh... no. I, uh...

11:59.867 --> 12:01.992
No. I changed the concept.
I was thinking...

12:02.017 --> 12:02.724
Surprise me.

12:44.733 --> 12:47.167
Here, your turn.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.400
If he looks up, aim for his mouth.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.867
Come on. Play.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.367
You were gone for months.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.967
Got tired of playing this game alone.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.700
I called the convent.

13:05.067 --> 13:07.067
The Mother Abbess answered.

13:07.867 --> 13:10.067
I hung up.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.267
What were you going to ask her?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.200
I don't know. I just...

13:24.067 --> 13:25.667
I want to know he's OK.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.600
You had a boy.

13:32.900 --> 13:36.467
Nina, I think you should go see him.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.400
At least once.

13:40.433 --> 13:43.500
It's a day there and back.

13:43.533 --> 13:46.733
Ask Claude to send you out
of town on an errand.

13:46.767 --> 13:48.567
Claude?

13:48.600 --> 13:50.233
Why not?

13:50.267 --> 13:52.400
He's your friend, isn't he?

14:00.133 --> 14:02.133
-Perhaps we adjust the sleeve...
-It's not my arms.

14:02.167 --> 14:04.300
It's my neck, my waist, my chest.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.767
I feel like someone is
sitting on my chest.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.267
I think, if we alter this seam...

14:09.300 --> 14:11.667
But what about the collar?
It's choking me.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.433
I feel like a sausage!

14:13.467 --> 14:16.333
Giselle, don't forget,
you have a lovely veil.

14:16.367 --> 14:19.667
That's not going to make
breathing any easier.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.467
Ah. Marianne mentioned you might
want to order some new material.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.733
Yes, please. New material.
I want new material.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.333
Giselle, there's nothing wrong...

14:27.367 --> 14:29.633
I want something that breathes!

14:29.667 --> 14:31.800
What the fuck are you doing?

14:31.833 --> 14:33.633
- Claude.
- I want to see my neck.

14:33.667 --> 14:38.066
You don't have a neck! Why do
you think we gave you a collar?

14:38.067 --> 14:39.700
What does he mean, I have no neck?

14:39.733 --> 14:42.300
He didn't mean it. You have
a lovely neck, Giselle.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.100
- Would you like some more champagne?
- No!

14:44.133 --> 14:46.567
- I'll apologise for you.
- Oh, you do that.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.867
- Ungrateful cow!
- Ssh.

14:49.900 --> 14:53.367
Maybe you want to put your energy
into the clients we don't have yet!

14:53.400 --> 14:55.767
- Go away. Get out of Paris.
- What?

14:55.800 --> 14:59.300
Use the cottage. Take long walks,
take naps, count the fucking stars!

14:59.333 --> 15:04.067
Mama can cook your meals and keep the
flies off you. You only need to work!

15:07.467 --> 15:09.067
I need the work.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.267
Try this.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.733
Just use the space, all right? Just...

15:25.967 --> 15:27.267
Have fun.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.833
Nice. OK.

15:29.867 --> 15:32.967
Look to me. Very nice.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.067
Hold that. Hold that.

15:35.833 --> 15:38.267
Right, this is a dog leash.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.933
Very good.

15:40.967 --> 15:44.433
OK, straighter with the hand. I
like that line. That's nice.

15:44.467 --> 15:46.700
Put your arm out like that.

15:48.433 --> 15:50.500
Sorry.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.433
Can I make it up to you?

15:53.467 --> 15:58.233
Unless you don't want to see a side of
this city that doesn't fit into this room?

16:01.133 --> 16:04.833
Glad you called, Paul. When you worked
for me, you never took time for lunch.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.900
Well, you had too many orders, Frederic.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.267
Everybody wanted to wear Lemare.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.066
Doing the fragrance now. Was
that your idea or Trouvier's?

16:12.067 --> 16:13.500
Helen's.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.833
Ah. Oh, I see.

16:15.867 --> 16:18.700
So your pretty wife's still
your most valuable asset?

16:20.067 --> 16:22.733
Very lucky for you to be on the
receiving end of Trouvier's gifts.

16:22.767 --> 16:25.567
I didn't have anyone bank-rolling
me when I started out.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.233
Not that anyone is more
deserving than you, of course.

16:29.267 --> 16:34.200
Clearly time for the old guard to
step aside and make room for the new.

16:34.233 --> 16:36.333
Oh, I think there's room for both.

16:36.367 --> 16:38.133
No, actually, there isn't.

16:38.167 --> 16:38.892
Frederic...

16:38.917 --> 16:41.066
Perhaps it's time for me
to put my energy elsewhere.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.067
Read a book, plant a rose,

16:43.100 --> 16:45.267
spend more time at the house in Spain.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.500
You're not ready to leave
Paris, and you know it.

16:47.533 --> 16:50.433
You've outlasted everyone
in this business.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.767
Given more women confidence
than anyone who's ever lived.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.067
You're beginning to sound
like the American reporter.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.600
Be careful, Frederic.

16:57.633 --> 17:00.467
I met with Monsieur Rossi
several weeks ago.

17:00.500 --> 17:04.300
Life magazine asked him to
do a story on our atelier.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.267
So he approached you before me?
I see. That's interesting.

17:07.300 --> 17:10.099
I could have done without his attention.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.567
He seemed more curious about the past...

17:13.567 --> 17:15.300
...than the present.

17:18.067 --> 17:20.333
You might want to keep
the door half closed.

17:21.433 --> 17:24.500
Why? I've got nothing to hide.

17:24.532 --> 17:26.567
I saved the industry.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.400
If this American wants to know how,

17:28.433 --> 17:32.367
I'd be happy to show him
my medal from de Gaulle.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.633
And when he asks questions
you're not prepared to answer?

17:40.067 --> 17:43.167
I had a specific job to do,
Paul, and I did it well.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.633
I can't be held accountable

17:44.667 --> 17:47.533
for actions taken by
others working under me.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.233
There were hundreds on the
payroll during the war.

17:51.267 --> 17:54.067
I couldn't possibly monitor
their behaviour...

17:55.067 --> 17:57.333
...or keep track of their allegiances.

18:14.933 --> 18:17.800
Welcome back. You've been missed.

18:18.867 --> 18:21.833
Yes, I've heard all the joyful whispers.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.433
I missed you.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.067
What a shame.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.400
That collar was such a beautiful detail.

18:31.067 --> 18:34.133
So... what do you need?

18:34.167 --> 18:35.967
Er... more of this?

18:36.067 --> 18:39.700
A favour. Can you send me out of town?

18:39.733 --> 18:41.600
What for?

18:41.633 --> 18:42.767
Er... this?

18:44.800 --> 18:47.100
Where are you going?

18:49.667 --> 18:52.167
What's wrong?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.950
Is this about what
happened at the market?

18:54.975 --> 18:55.867
No.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.733
You've been different ever since
you came back from your auntie's.

18:58.767 --> 19:01.600
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

19:03.167 --> 19:05.133
It's like she's sucked
all the life out of you.

19:05.167 --> 19:07.066
Did she use you as a hot water bottle?

19:07.067 --> 19:10.067
Please. Just help me leave for the day.

19:15.167 --> 19:17.400
Just promise me one thing.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.967
You'll come back.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.600
Your brother is looking for you.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.133
I'm not apologising to the bride.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.900
So if he wants me to
turn the other cheek,

19:31.933 --> 19:36.100
tell him she's more than
welcome to a look at both.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.367
He said you and your
mother need the car.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.933
You're going out to the country.

19:40.967 --> 19:43.133
- Did he mean the cottage?
- Yes. Why?

19:43.167 --> 19:45.967
But what's the purpose of the trip?

19:46.067 --> 19:48.800
- Sightseeing.
- Why are you going?

19:48.833 --> 19:52.533
Did you ask this many
questions in your last job?

19:52.567 --> 19:55.700
Because my understanding
was you just took orders.

20:20.367 --> 20:22.533
I'll let her know you're here.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.800
Let me help.
Your arm's still weak.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.267
I'm fine.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.500
God, what have you got in
here, your favourite chair?

20:52.533 --> 20:54.967
Those are dishes. And a decent pot.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.933
How long do you think we'll stay here?

20:57.967 --> 21:00.833
As long as it takes. You
need peace and quiet.

21:00.867 --> 21:02.367
I had pretty yellow pills for that.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.167
- They're gone.
- Never mind.

21:09.433 --> 21:11.400
Oh, my God.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.533
It's nothing.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.667
Have you got the key?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.700
Does your
mother know you're here?

21:43.733 --> 21:47.300
I was sent to Alençon
to pick up supplies

21:47.333 --> 21:49.467
but I was close so...

21:49.500 --> 21:52.433
I got back on the train,
hoping I could see him.

21:52.467 --> 21:55.633
Visits aren't allowed, Nina.
You know that.

21:56.767 --> 21:58.633
I just want to hold him for a...

21:58.667 --> 22:00.633
I'm afraid that's not possible.

22:08.667 --> 22:12.233
We introduced him to a very
lovely couple last week.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.833
They've already taken him.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.567
The adoption will soon be formalised.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.833
I know it's difficult to hear, Nina,

22:23.867 --> 22:27.667
but this has to be a source
of relief, not suffering.

22:29.667 --> 22:33.500
God has provided a family
that's well off and...

22:33.533 --> 22:38.367
stable, who can offer
this child a future.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.767
Something you cannot.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.467
Don't you want what's best for him?

23:39.567 --> 23:41.400
Marc!

23:48.833 --> 23:50.467
Marc!

23:51.367 --> 23:53.367
Marc!

23:54.600 --> 23:56.400
Marc!

23:57.900 --> 24:00.900
- Marc!
- Claude. Who are you talking to?

24:00.933 --> 24:03.733
He's in... He's in there!

24:03.767 --> 24:05.733
Who?

24:07.100 --> 24:09.400
There's no-one here but us.

24:13.433 --> 24:16.500
Please. Come inside, Claude.

24:21.267 --> 24:22.767
Come on.

24:26.067 --> 24:29.733
There. It's all right. Come on.

24:29.767 --> 24:30.933
There.

24:37.067 --> 24:40.200
Come on. It's all right.
There's no-one there.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.567
Come on. Come on, Claude.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.867
I don't understand. Why now?

24:51.900 --> 24:54.867
It's just a little luncheon.

24:54.900 --> 24:59.300
There are 30 names on this list,
Paul, and you don't do little.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.467
If you want to host
something in his honour,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.700
then throw Lemare a
party after the show.

25:03.733 --> 25:05.333
Why squander these resources?

25:05.367 --> 25:07.600
Because I owe it to him, Helen.

25:10.067 --> 25:12.333
I think I know what
this is really about.

25:13.633 --> 25:15.300
You feel guilty.

25:15.333 --> 25:20.300
This Trouvier deal, you feel like
on some level you don't deserve it.

25:21.767 --> 25:23.133
But you do.

25:24.300 --> 25:27.200
You and your brother...

25:27.233 --> 25:30.100
You've earned this level of support.

25:30.133 --> 25:32.500
And support comes with a price.

25:32.533 --> 25:34.100
Exactly.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.200
So wouldn't your time be better
spent pursuing the perfume deal?

25:37.233 --> 25:38.667
You've already got Cassatt on the hook

25:38.700 --> 25:40.400
and we're having that
breakfast with him...

25:40.433 --> 25:43.433
- We can have it all.
- Are you sure about that?

25:43.467 --> 25:47.367
Because you've told Claude he can be as
extravagant and bold as he wants to be...

25:47.400 --> 25:51.433
Then don't compromise the vision.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.633
You can't do half a somersault.
You get hurt.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.867
- I worry about you.
- I know.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.433
That's what drives me.

26:06.967 --> 26:09.567
Pardon. I just spoke with the bride.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.933
She's decided that the high
collar is flattering after all.

26:12.967 --> 26:13.575
And...

26:13.600 --> 26:15.400
I knew you were the
one to convince her.

26:15.433 --> 26:17.333
And the Minister's office called.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.433
Monsieur Gambon will
attend the luncheon.

26:20.433 --> 26:22.066
Eliette Malet's office called as well.

26:22.067 --> 26:25.400
She'll swing by after her breakfast
meeting at the magazine.

26:25.433 --> 26:26.900
Oh, splendid.

26:26.933 --> 26:29.066
Is there anything else?

26:29.067 --> 26:32.066
No, that's more than enough.

26:32.067 --> 26:34.967
Thank you, Charlotte. Good night.

26:56.867 --> 27:01.066
I was only surprised Monsieur
wanted to see Nina in them.

27:01.067 --> 27:03.300
He's never really designed for... girls.

27:03.333 --> 27:05.433
She has a connection to the clothes.

27:05.467 --> 27:09.900
I mean, he may design but it
takes Nina and her mother to...

27:09.933 --> 27:12.467
to bring 'em to life. Right?

27:12.500 --> 27:13.900
I suppose.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.633
But she always seemed
happy to be on the bench.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.400
All the girls are.

27:18.433 --> 27:19.900
Things are tough.

27:19.933 --> 27:23.333
Better to be working over an ironing
board than sleeping on one.

27:23.367 --> 27:27.067
Were you here? In Paris during the war?

27:29.700 --> 27:32.367
It was a confusing time.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.733
If you stepped onto a bus and a
German soldier offered you his seat,

27:35.767 --> 27:38.600
what were you supposed to do?

27:38.633 --> 27:40.767
Do you take it or...

27:40.800 --> 27:42.600
do you stand?

27:42.633 --> 27:45.400
And if you did take it,
does that make you...

27:49.333 --> 27:53.066
People were... quick to judge.

27:53.067 --> 27:54.567
Some still are.

27:56.367 --> 27:59.167
Did anybody... judge Monsieur Sabine?

28:00.767 --> 28:02.467
- For what?
- I just mean,

28:02.500 --> 28:06.900
can you think of anybody in the
studio who might... resent him?

28:06.933 --> 28:09.067
Besides his brother.

28:10.867 --> 28:13.066
Why would his brother... resent him?

28:13.067 --> 28:16.767
I want to dance. Come on,
Billy, dance with me.

28:57.133 --> 29:01.400
So why is it OK to eat asparagus with
your fingers and not green beans?

29:01.433 --> 29:03.233
I don't make the rules, darling.

29:03.267 --> 29:04.767
Just trying to educate you.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.400
OK, what about corn?

29:06.433 --> 29:07.900
- Corn?
- Yeah.

29:07.933 --> 29:09.367
Corn is for chickens.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.700
Well, can they eat it with their hands?

29:11.733 --> 29:13.400
Where are we?

29:15.133 --> 29:17.200
I thought you said there
was a better club?

29:17.233 --> 29:21.267
I did. But the better
ones don't have signs.

29:22.167 --> 29:24.567
Do they have doors?

29:33.567 --> 29:37.400
It's too late, Billy. Picture
show's already started.

29:38.267 --> 29:40.500
But if you want to sit in the dark...

29:42.667 --> 29:46.400
Well, it can't be any darker than
the last place you took me to.

30:04.567 --> 30:06.167
Oh, my!

30:06.200 --> 30:09.167
Still a work in progress but
it's slowly coming to life.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.300
Oh, no, dear, it's alive.
I want to lick it.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.533
The pattern's an homage
to Lemare's tulipe coat.

30:16.567 --> 30:20.833
Yes, of course it is, but you've
raised it to a whole new level.

30:20.867 --> 30:22.267
You devil.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.667
My intention is only to pay tribute.

30:24.700 --> 30:27.500
He's never really been given
his due as a designer.

30:27.533 --> 30:30.667
No, you're spot on. He's been
taken for granted, hasn't he?

30:30.700 --> 30:33.967
-Now what else can I see?
-You're being naughty, Eliette.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.400
And if I show you more...

30:36.433 --> 30:38.333
...you'll just fall asleep at my show.

30:38.367 --> 30:40.567
I did that once!

30:40.600 --> 30:43.867
Who knew you couldn't wash down
two aspirin with a daiquiri?

30:43.900 --> 30:46.233
- What else can I see?
- No, honestly,

30:46.267 --> 30:49.700
I invited you here so that we
could be naughty together.

30:49.733 --> 30:51.233
Ooh, really?

30:51.267 --> 30:54.233
Frederic mentioned that he
was lunching with you today

30:54.267 --> 30:56.500
and I thought it would
be a perfect opportunity

30:56.533 --> 31:00.066
to host a small gathering in his honour.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.467
Today?

31:01.500 --> 31:05.167
How could you possibly toss
together a luncheon that quickly?

31:05.200 --> 31:06.633
I've already started.

31:06.667 --> 31:09.267
I know it's a bit rash but
there's a visiting reporter

31:09.300 --> 31:12.333
from the States doing a
story on Monsieur Lemare.

31:12.367 --> 31:14.767
I want him to see Frederic

31:14.800 --> 31:17.300
toasted by his nearest and dearest.

31:18.700 --> 31:21.100
Count me in. Plus one.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.833
These weeks before the show,

31:34.867 --> 31:36.633
he just loses all track of time.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.800
Perhaps we can do this another day.

31:39.833 --> 31:41.667
No, no, he'll be here.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.067
My uncle told me to ask
about your lovely daughter.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.533
- What is her name?
- Cesar.

31:49.567 --> 31:53.100
We have no daughter. Just Cesar.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.733
Oh. I misunderstood.

31:57.767 --> 32:02.066
- Is he married?
- Only in his mother's imagination.

32:02.067 --> 32:03.700
There's a steady stream of girls

32:03.733 --> 32:07.667
but his real passion seems to
be reserved for his Bugatti.

32:09.967 --> 32:14.067
Tante Josephine did mention that he was
training to be a professional racer.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.733
Hmm. That's in his imagination.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.367
Helen, if your husband has more
important business to tend to...

32:25.400 --> 32:28.433
Nothing is more important than this.

32:28.467 --> 32:31.167
He is very eager to share
with you the new look

32:31.200 --> 32:32.833
and the themes, the essence...

32:32.867 --> 32:36.667
Really? I was under the impression
he was guarding a state secret.

32:38.833 --> 32:43.133
He is not meeting with
anyone but you, Pierre.

32:47.667 --> 32:49.667
May I show you something?

33:12.067 --> 33:14.733
Well... this is auspicious.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.500
Claude?

33:22.433 --> 33:25.733
- What?
- A card. Turn it over.

33:27.467 --> 33:30.067
Oh. That one.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.967
The Chariot.

33:35.067 --> 33:38.567
Soon you will receive
the admiration of many.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.500
Who cares?

33:42.433 --> 33:44.200
Who cares?

33:45.267 --> 33:47.967
I'd rather be one
person's shot of whisky

33:48.067 --> 33:50.767
than everybody's cup of tea.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.267
Turn over the next one.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.067
I don't even know why
I'm doing it any more.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.300
Doing what?

34:02.200 --> 34:07.367
I remember watching Celeste
get ready for work.

34:07.400 --> 34:10.567
Celeste? From the brothel next door?

34:10.600 --> 34:11.933
You were a little boy.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.833
This is who you were thinking about?

34:13.867 --> 34:17.233
She may have been a silly
whore to you, but not to me.

34:20.067 --> 34:23.300
During the day, she was just another...

34:23.333 --> 34:27.800
sad, lonely dishrag of a girl but...

34:28.833 --> 34:31.067
...at night...

34:31.967 --> 34:34.567
...at night she became someone else.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.800
And her clothes were cheap
but they were bright.

34:39.833 --> 34:43.733
They had swagger and... she
looked six inches taller.

34:47.067 --> 34:48.800
And I remember thinking,

34:50.900 --> 34:53.067
with the right dress,

34:54.233 --> 34:57.300
the right shape, the right colour...

35:00.533 --> 35:04.133
...you could create a world
that you wanted to live in.

35:06.967 --> 35:09.200
You could take away the misery.

35:13.933 --> 35:15.733
And now...

35:17.233 --> 35:19.267
Now I realise that...

35:20.733 --> 35:23.300
...those clothes, there
was no magic in them.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.567
They didn't change a goddamn thing.
They just...

35:32.733 --> 35:34.733
They just covered it up.

35:41.533 --> 35:43.400
I didn't find her silly.

35:44.833 --> 35:47.633
Celeste.

35:47.667 --> 35:52.200
She was the one who told me to leave a
plate of meringue beside the Seine.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.233
Why?

35:55.267 --> 35:58.333
An offering to the Goddess of the River.

35:59.433 --> 36:00.933
To find love.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.067
I see.

36:06.067 --> 36:10.267
I see. And did, erm... did
the Goddess hear you?

36:11.600 --> 36:15.567
What shiftless bastard did the
river throw up that time?

36:21.333 --> 36:22.733
You.

36:34.167 --> 36:36.433
Gentlemen, thank you so much for coming.

36:36.467 --> 36:40.700
Would you excuse me? Monsieur Gambon, thank
you for coming at such short notice.

36:40.733 --> 36:44.167
My pleasure. I sensed the whole thing
was put together at short notice.

36:44.200 --> 36:48.267
I've been meaning to do this for a while
and finally the timing felt right.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.067
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thank you.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.567
- Billy.
- Oh, sorry.

36:52.600 --> 36:56.333
Make sure you get some flattering
shots of that gentleman.

36:56.367 --> 36:59.467
-He's here on the President's behalf.
-Right.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.933
Hi. How are you?

37:01.967 --> 37:05.533
OK, just hold it right there. Thank you.

37:05.567 --> 37:09.067
-That's great. ROSSI: No, really,
it's fine. I'll keep my coat.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.867
- You shouldn't be here.
- I was invited.

37:16.900 --> 37:19.667
I'm doing a story on the
guest of honour, remember?

37:23.767 --> 37:26.600
Don't forget, kid, I speak
more than one language.

37:26.633 --> 37:29.467
Monsieur Rossi. So glad
you could join us.

37:29.500 --> 37:30.800
How are you?

37:30.833 --> 37:32.667
Billy, take a picture, would you?

37:38.433 --> 37:40.066
Yeah. Great.

37:40.067 --> 37:41.500
Excuse me.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.200
What are we doing here? I thought
we were going to the Meurice.

37:58.233 --> 38:00.300
I bumped into your protégé this morning,

38:00.333 --> 38:02.467
and he invited us to join him for lunch.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.067
I'm guessing he's riddled with doubt

38:05.100 --> 38:08.167
over some design or other
and needs reassurance.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.767
Here you go, monsieur. Keep the change.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.066
I saw him yesterday. He
said nothing about this.

38:13.067 --> 38:14.400
Oh, darling, come on.

38:14.433 --> 38:16.967
Everybody knows the black
beast of insecurity

38:17.067 --> 38:18.967
only visits in the middle of the night.

38:19.067 --> 38:20.667
- Come along.
- Eliette...

38:20.700 --> 38:23.333
Oh, come on.

38:23.367 --> 38:26.167
He's in a state. And you
needn't say a word.

38:26.200 --> 38:29.600
You can just sit there
like a Buddha and smile.

38:29.633 --> 38:31.100
Let him rub your belly.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.733
Of course.

38:48.533 --> 38:51.066
Balou! Balou, where are you?

38:51.067 --> 38:52.267
Balou, come back!

38:52.300 --> 38:54.867
Balou!

38:54.900 --> 38:56.567
Come back!

38:56.600 --> 38:58.967
Balou! Stop!

39:02.633 --> 39:04.100
Balou!

39:08.833 --> 39:10.467
It means he likes you.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.600
He's giving you kisses.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.066
No, he's not my type.

39:17.467 --> 39:19.867
Maybe he is.

39:22.633 --> 39:24.100
Are you ill?

39:24.133 --> 39:25.600
Define "ill".

39:25.633 --> 39:28.233
Well, I only sleep during
the day if I'm ill.

39:28.267 --> 39:29.933
Oh.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.467
And who are you?

39:31.500 --> 39:34.600
Josette. That's our farm over there.

39:45.267 --> 39:47.100
Are you an artist?

39:48.633 --> 39:50.333
No.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.867
An artist seeks to
communicate his inner life

39:53.900 --> 39:55.300
to the outside world with integrity.

39:55.333 --> 39:59.200
I bend to the whims, however
capricious, of ladies

39:59.233 --> 40:03.000
who can afford to pay the price
of a pretty frock or two.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.533
I make princesses.

40:12.433 --> 40:14.600
Can you make me into a princess?

40:24.133 --> 40:28.333
This is Dominique. She's our top model.

40:28.367 --> 40:32.167
Frederic. Absolute perfection.

40:32.200 --> 40:36.700
Yum-yum. And I don't just mean
this glorious lunch, Paul.

40:36.733 --> 40:40.000
Billy? Can you get a picture of that?

40:40.967 --> 40:42.767
I remember that.

40:42.800 --> 40:47.100
Did you design that for Jean Harlow or
Gene Tierney? Is one of those a man?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.333
Diaphanous.

40:53.367 --> 40:56.100
I wanted that dress the
first time I saw it.

40:56.133 --> 40:59.867
I didn't know what life I'd be wearing
it in, but I thought, "Damn it.

40:59.900 --> 41:02.133
"As soon as I find out, I'm buying it."

41:07.233 --> 41:10.400
Oh, I remember that. I loved it.

41:10.433 --> 41:13.333
And that. Really wonderful, darling.

41:22.133 --> 41:24.467
Could we speak in private for a moment?

41:25.333 --> 41:27.067
- Gorgeous.
- Excuse me.

41:44.733 --> 41:46.733
What the hell are you doing?

41:46.767 --> 41:49.833
I'm toasting you, Frederic.

41:49.867 --> 41:51.633
Securing your place as a legend,

41:51.667 --> 41:54.400
so you can leave this
business untouchable.

41:54.433 --> 41:57.200
And what makes you think
I'm leaving this business?

41:57.233 --> 41:59.533
You're about to announce
your retirement.

41:59.567 --> 42:01.500
The fuck I am!

42:01.533 --> 42:03.467
You don't have a choice.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.433
I'm gonna make it unwise for a reporter

42:05.467 --> 42:08.100
to diminish your status
as a national hero.

42:08.133 --> 42:11.066
A hero who's trading the
hectic showrooms of Paris

42:11.067 --> 42:12.667
for a country garden in Spain.

42:12.700 --> 42:15.267
You little prick.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.200
I made you!

42:16.225 --> 42:18.900
Yes, but now you're
prepared to destroy me.

42:18.933 --> 42:21.667
But I still have enough
respect for you to help you.

42:21.700 --> 42:24.100
Help? I don't need your help.

42:24.933 --> 42:26.767
I covered my tracks.

42:28.467 --> 42:31.267
I never made the trips to Berlin.
You did.

42:31.300 --> 42:35.200
I'm the one with the medal on my shelf.
What have you got?

42:35.233 --> 42:39.200
The gentleman sitting next to Eliette
is from the President's office.

42:41.067 --> 42:45.533
If you decide to slit my
throat, blood will splatter

42:45.567 --> 42:48.533
the very people who gave you that medal.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.067
Retire now, Frederic.

42:50.100 --> 42:54.400
If you're not in the game, they'll
forget that you broke the rules.

42:54.433 --> 42:57.400
You've always been way
too sure of yourself.

42:57.433 --> 43:01.567
Well, I've had enough
surprises for one day.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.400
I'll be leaving now.

43:03.433 --> 43:07.633
No, you won't. You might be vain but
you're not stupid. I'm saving both of us.

43:10.067 --> 43:12.633
You did it for power, Frederic.

43:12.667 --> 43:15.300
I did it to save someone I love.

43:17.167 --> 43:18.933
The difference may matter to you.

43:18.967 --> 43:20.733
It won't to anybody else.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.233
For almost 30 years,

43:29.267 --> 43:34.433
every woman... directly or
indirectly... has worn a Lemare.

43:34.467 --> 43:36.900
And it is my supreme pleasure

43:36.933 --> 43:39.100
to give my great friend, Frederic,

43:39.133 --> 43:41.300
the first Visionary Award

43:41.333 --> 43:44.100
on behalf of Jules De Modes magazine.

43:45.067 --> 43:46.533
Long live the King!

44:15.300 --> 44:18.833
Eliette, thank you.

44:18.867 --> 44:21.500
The years I've devoted to this industry

44:21.533 --> 44:24.900
have never felt like work.
It is a passion.

44:24.933 --> 44:30.067
And I cannot imagine what
I would do without it.

44:30.933 --> 44:34.967
Which is why receiving this award...

44:35.067 --> 44:39.233
...makes what I have to say
all the more difficult.

44:43.167 --> 44:46.133
I will not be showing
another collection.

44:52.233 --> 44:55.600
It's time to step off the stage...

44:55.633 --> 44:59.733
...and make way for the
bold new talents...

44:59.767 --> 45:01.867
worthy of your attention.

45:22.100 --> 45:24.133
Rossi. Where you going?

45:24.167 --> 45:25.600
Back to my hotel.

45:29.453 --> 45:32.900
Your boss is even more
slippery than I thought.

45:32.933 --> 45:34.733
Good luck, kid.

45:49.300 --> 45:51.600
That was short. What happened?

45:52.967 --> 45:55.133
We need to find someone else.

45:55.167 --> 45:56.633
Someone who can't be bribed

45:56.667 --> 45:59.467
with a phony award and a slab of cake.

46:10.100 --> 46:12.767
- What's this?
- My castle.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.567
Oh.

46:14.600 --> 46:16.767
Did you make it yourself?

46:16.800 --> 46:20.900
No. One day it just showed up.
This pile of rocks.

46:20.933 --> 46:22.567
Like magic.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.067
Oh.

46:26.133 --> 46:27.467
- Here's the moat...
- Right.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.667
-...and that's the drawbridge.
-Oh! Sorry.

46:29.700 --> 46:33.233
And these are my guards.
They protect my castle.

46:33.267 --> 46:36.333
See their uniforms?

46:36.367 --> 46:38.533
This one's uniform looks
like it's been...

46:38.567 --> 46:41.600
...damaged in battle.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.500
May I?

47:07.333 --> 47:10.133
Now if only we had some more feathers.

47:10.167 --> 47:12.067
We do. I'll show you.

47:18.533 --> 47:22.066
You can only take them from the outside.

47:22.067 --> 47:25.533
If their mama smells you,
she might not come back.

47:26.700 --> 47:28.567
Right.

48:08.567 --> 48:10.867
I made that for Lady Pritchard.

48:10.900 --> 48:12.700
- Very elegant.
- So was she.

48:12.733 --> 48:16.067
She could fall down a flight of stairs
without breaking her champagne glass.

48:16.100 --> 48:17.900
Monsieur Lemare must have been gutted

48:17.933 --> 48:19.933
when you left his house.

48:19.967 --> 48:21.733
I learnt a lot from him.

48:21.767 --> 48:24.933
He taught me that every smart
dress should have pockets.

48:24.967 --> 48:27.167
I just have to figure
out how to hide them.

48:29.067 --> 48:30.633
Nina?

48:34.533 --> 48:37.633
My God, I almost didn't recognise you.

48:39.367 --> 48:42.400
I need to speak to Monsieur.
I'll be back.

48:55.667 --> 48:57.600
May I interrupt?

49:00.867 --> 49:02.300
Nina.

49:03.500 --> 49:06.633
- What have you done?
- I cut it. For you.

49:07.867 --> 49:09.700
I heard you wanted
models with short hair.

49:11.100 --> 49:14.133
- But you made it very clear...
- I changed my mind.

49:15.067 --> 49:17.900
But I won't do it on a
seamstress's salary.

49:17.933 --> 49:19.700
I see.

49:26.433 --> 49:28.267
Welcome back.

49:53.867 --> 49:56.333
How did it go?

49:56.367 --> 49:58.133
Was Lemare pleasantly surprised?

49:58.167 --> 50:00.066
I'd say we all were.

50:00.067 --> 50:01.333
Can I help?

50:12.500 --> 50:15.800
I thought you'd be asleep at your desk.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.200
Can I tell you about the
breakfast you missed?

50:22.233 --> 50:23.800
I couldn't get there. I'm sorry.

50:25.467 --> 50:29.467
I understand the master
is filling many plates,

50:29.500 --> 50:34.000
but now you have one
less to worry about.

50:34.033 --> 50:36.367
Monsieur Cassatt didn't
need to see much.

50:36.400 --> 50:40.133
I showed him one sketch. Just... one.

50:40.167 --> 50:42.767
And I told him that you ripped it up

50:42.800 --> 50:45.467
because I questioned the sleeves.

50:45.500 --> 50:48.000
It made him smile. Evidently
he and Madame Cassatt

50:48.033 --> 50:50.133
live in a permanent state of...

50:52.067 --> 50:53.600
...disagreement.

50:55.700 --> 50:57.167
What's wrong?

50:57.200 --> 51:00.066
I needed to be there.

51:00.067 --> 51:02.233
Why? Paul, you can't be
in two places at once

51:02.267 --> 51:04.167
and you were willing to
move heaven and earth

51:04.200 --> 51:05.833
to make the Lemare tribute happen today.

51:05.867 --> 51:09.300
I needed to be there. This
is my house, my name.

51:11.167 --> 51:13.967
I specifically said I didn't
want him to see those sketches

51:14.067 --> 51:15.400
and you showed them to him anyway.

51:15.433 --> 51:18.667
He needed to see something.

51:18.700 --> 51:20.467
And it worked.

51:20.500 --> 51:21.900
So my wife knows better?

51:21.933 --> 51:23.667
The only reason we have
Cassatt at the table

51:23.700 --> 51:26.066
is because my uncle made that call.

51:26.067 --> 51:27.700
Do you resent that, too?

51:27.733 --> 51:29.633
Yes, I do.

51:29.667 --> 51:31.467
Your aunt and uncle are buying the meat

51:31.500 --> 51:33.933
and now you're cutting it up
and asking me to open wide.

51:33.967 --> 51:36.100
Your chair was empty.

51:36.133 --> 51:38.100
He was slighted by that.

51:38.133 --> 51:39.733
For some Godforsaken reason,

51:39.767 --> 51:41.800
your past was more important
to you than your future,

51:41.833 --> 51:44.066
and I had to save an
embarrassing situation.

51:44.067 --> 51:46.133
By making it more embarrassing.

51:53.467 --> 51:56.367
Now that you and Claude
seem to be the new team,

51:56.400 --> 51:59.100
maybe I should find
another line of work.

52:29.433 --> 52:32.600
Oh! You.

52:34.133 --> 52:35.533
You, uh... you look like...

52:36.800 --> 52:38.300
Joan of Arc.

52:40.533 --> 52:42.400
I stopped by your station earlier...

52:42.433 --> 52:45.100
Why were you looking for me?

52:45.133 --> 52:49.100
Well, because I saw something and
I thought you might like it.

53:00.367 --> 53:03.233
Ahh. How... How did you know?

53:04.600 --> 53:07.333
Because, um... I'm paying attention.

53:09.400 --> 53:10.867
Billy?

53:10.900 --> 53:12.900
Billy?

53:12.933 --> 53:14.759
I told my friends we'd
meet them at the restaurant.

53:14.784 --> 53:15.367
Right.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.367
It's almost nine.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.700
I'll... see you tomorrow.

53:49.733 --> 53:51.500
Monsieur?

53:51.533 --> 53:53.867
What is it, Charlotte?

53:53.900 --> 53:57.167
It's done. I just thought you
might want to have a last look.

54:00.133 --> 54:01.733
Thank you.

54:05.933 --> 54:08.067
What did you ultimately say to her,

54:08.100 --> 54:10.433
to take her hands away from her neck?

54:10.467 --> 54:12.433
Her nerves weren't about the dress.

54:12.467 --> 54:15.067
It was about the next 50 years.

54:24.400 --> 54:27.067
- Do you approve?
- That's a gem.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.267
Thank you.

56:29.200 --> 56:31.133
Just need to
get a few more things.

56:31.167 --> 56:32.900
Keep your paws off that folder.

56:32.933 --> 56:34.700
The ink is still wet.

57:02.667 --> 57:04.767
Why didn't you wash this out?

57:04.800 --> 57:06.300
There's soup in it.

57:08.667 --> 57:11.767
Well... pour it out. Feed a squirrel.

57:11.800 --> 57:13.700
You'll be hungry later.

57:13.733 --> 57:16.567
Why don't we just eat here?
What's the rush?

57:16.600 --> 57:19.800
You'll do better at home. This kind
of damp's no good for anybody.

57:19.833 --> 57:21.267
Home?

57:21.300 --> 57:23.533
I don't know why you think
my home is any drier.

57:23.567 --> 57:25.367
I have mushrooms growing in my shoes.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.900
We need to get back to your brother.
Hurry up.

57:27.933 --> 57:31.133
Hang on. I've got a bag inside.

57:32.200 --> 57:35.067
Don't dawdle!
