01:01.520 --> 01:03.512
Soz, it wasn't me. It were him.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.852
Do you want that, then?

01:10.195 --> 01:11.930
- I'll have it.
- Get lost!

01:12.030 --> 01:13.098
Come on.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.358
My mum locked us out and
I've had nothing all day.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.219
Go on.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.104
Why are you hopping?

01:19.204 --> 01:21.197
I broke my leg. I got run over.

01:22.343 --> 01:23.699
Jesus, all right.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.374
Cheers!

02:27.564 --> 02:28.674
Well, what's up?

02:28.774 --> 02:30.759
It smells nice. It smells of pear drops.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.103
You better open the window or
we'll both be on our bloody backs.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.523
The careers officer was seeing
parents at school last week and...

02:37.825 --> 02:39.226
Well, we've missed it.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.445
That arrived this morning
asking where we were.

02:42.913 --> 02:46.240
I've been down there this afternoon
and had a word with Mr Banks.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.535
Are you refusing to get involved?

02:50.546 --> 02:53.240
I was proper shown up
at that school today.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.617
Well, I've not encouraged any of it.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.828
He's becoming a weirdo!

02:57.928 --> 02:59.288
A recluse at his age.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.206
Recluse is a bit of a
strong word, isn't it?

03:01.306 --> 03:02.958
You stay out of this, Dad.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.384
I want to hold my head up in this town.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.382
What about that youth club?

03:10.482 --> 03:12.509
Oh, Mum, I'm not going.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.344
Your cousin Lee's not
scared of going there.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.846
I'm not scared!

03:15.946 --> 03:17.563
What's your problem, then?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.655
Two steps.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.991
Yeah, you're OK.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.243
Grab the doorframe.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.709
- You all right?
- Yeah.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.331
Bloody hell, what's this?

03:42.431 --> 03:44.374
You do what you want with this.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.542
I can't take that.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.711
You take it. They'll only
bloody nick it off me in here.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.755
They're not that bad, are they?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.882
Gotta share with the
bastards on the night shift.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.384
- OK.
- All right.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.852
I'll see you Saturday morning, then.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.058
OK.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.733
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.898
So, with your curriculum vitae,

04:07.998 --> 04:11.492
that's Latin, by the way,
you don't need to know that...

04:11.710 --> 04:16.447
But your CSEs, metalwork, maths,
science, if you pass them,

04:16.548 --> 04:17.873
where do they go?

04:18.175 --> 04:20.285
- You're late again, Clark!
- Been doctor's, sir.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.877
You all right?

04:22.387 --> 04:23.539
Wait a minute!

04:23.639 --> 04:26.298
I'll not have sexual
molestation in my class.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.635
And it'll only ever be molestation
with a face like yours, Clark!

04:29.795 --> 04:31.893
Book out, mallet head.
And while you're about it,

04:31.993 --> 04:34.807
do your top buttons up, we don't
want to see your wispy bum fluff!

04:40.197 --> 04:41.730
You cretin!

04:42.199 --> 04:43.732
You want to be a bit
more like your cousin.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.854
He's a bit docile,
but he knows his place.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.564
Clark! You bird brain.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.197
Let's have it. Come on.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.324
Come on. Let's get it over with.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.747
What have we got here?

04:59.967 --> 05:01.869
Oh, it's a poem.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.931
"I've got the blues for you.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.676
"I'll never get used to that
feeling that you're gone.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.382
"I'll never get used to
knowing I'm not the one."

05:16.900 --> 05:18.851
That's bobbins, that is, Clark.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.470
Who's the unlucky girl?

05:20.570 --> 05:23.272
Sir, he fancies a nurse on the bus!

05:23.407 --> 05:24.773
Oh, yeah?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.560
They're quite good in bed, nurses.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.072
That's not what we are here to discuss.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.401
It's not going to get you a job, is it?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.035
All right, sit down.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.497
I told your mother last week
you'd never amount to anything.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.667
And that goes for rest of you,
you bunch of mallet heads!

05:44.670 --> 05:47.004
Now, single file on the left!

05:55.355 --> 05:57.007
Bruiser, I got it!
I got the queer notebook!

05:57.107 --> 05:58.675
Hey! Give it me back!

05:58.775 --> 06:00.469
Nice poems, you little poof.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.804
What do you know about birds?
You don't even go out.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.389
You want it, you little spaz?

06:04.489 --> 06:07.017
Too busy wanking.
Wanking over that nurse.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.652
Come on, then.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.731
Get him, get him. Go on, Bruise.
Have him, have him!

06:12.831 --> 06:14.657
- Fuck off!
- Hey! Hey!

06:15.459 --> 06:17.159
- Fuck off, you twat!
- Ponce!

06:17.461 --> 06:19.245
Fuck off!

07:06.927 --> 07:08.752
I didn't know you were here, love.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.622
Have you thought any more
about the youth club?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.214
It'll be on tomorrow.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.342
All right, I'll go once.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.053
Good lad to you.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.599
Well, I bet once you've been,
you'll want to go again.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.152
- You little fez.
- Are you all right?

07:40.252 --> 07:43.113
Yeah, not bad. I got a couple
of sixties things in my bag.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.531
Maybe we could stick them on at the end.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.916
What have I told you?
Look, no old stuff.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.245
- What?
- Shite, I've gotta change the record!

07:50.345 --> 07:53.206
Hey, look, it's up to you.
You're the DJ.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.958
Look, I'm not playing to
an empty dance floor.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.842
It's all about the charts.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.545
Do you still want to be a DJ?

07:58.645 --> 08:00.630
Yeah, but I'll convert them.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.216
Give me a go. One record.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.225
I reckon it will fill the floor.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.227
Just one.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.146
I'll make sure Linda is out of the way.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.436
Oh, for fuck's sake,
not this shite again.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.576
All right, kids, that's it for tonight.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.786
I'll see you all again in a month.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.086
Ta-ra!

09:56.471 --> 09:58.623
Oi, knobhead! Fat twat!

09:58.723 --> 10:00.083
Fucking have him! Go on, Bruiser!

10:00.183 --> 10:01.251
Come on, then!

10:01.351 --> 10:02.794
Get him down, Bruise. Come on.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.963
Fucking have him! Wanker! Come on, then!

10:11.361 --> 10:13.645
Come on, Bruiser.
Fuck him up now, you twat!

10:14.197 --> 10:16.725
Hey! Come on, then, you fucking wankers!

10:18.535 --> 10:20.645
Oi, you're banned!

10:20.745 --> 10:21.938
- Get out!
- Linda!

10:22.038 --> 10:24.274
You little sod, get out! Go on.

10:24.374 --> 10:27.277
I see you around here again,
I'll kick your fucking teeth in!

10:27.377 --> 10:29.029
Go on! Move! Move! Move!

10:34.050 --> 10:35.250
Thanks for that, mate.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.086
- What's your name?
- It's, John.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.546
I'm Matt.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.257
Hey, are you into Northern Soul?

10:44.728 --> 10:45.928
Yeah.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.966
I've got tons of Northern records, me.
I've got all the labels.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.760
It were brilliant, that one.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.970
I've never heard of any of it before.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.641
I could tell. You look like
you're stuck in the '50s.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.643
Oh, and that dancing you were doing,

10:59.743 --> 11:01.652
it was like watching Bruce Lee.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.529
Look. Step like me.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.448
That's it.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.450
Then I twist each foot.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.994
Just like that.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.324
That's it.

11:14.424 --> 11:18.335
You're doing it.
That's the basic fucking step.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.005
Bruce bastard Lee?

11:32.442 --> 11:33.850
See that.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.013
"Burnsworth is a shithole."

11:37.113 --> 11:40.232
Whoever did that was absolutely spot-on.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.734
- Every day I look at that and...
- I did that.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.863
- You what?
- I did that.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.532
What, you wrote that?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.468
Yeah.

11:50.568 --> 11:53.495
You're a fucking terrorist, ain't you?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.324
They knock about together.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.125
Really? How do you know him?

11:59.135 --> 12:00.502
I don't, really.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.837
Oh, good.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.798
Where's your mum and dad?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.224
Dad's dead. Mum left us. Come on.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.596
Hey, I'll tell you what,
you'll like that Edwin Starr.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.016
Got a fucking great record for you.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.733
I got his tape, right.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.394
Taped live at Blackpool.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.573
It's our Paul's, but I can lend
it to you, if you like it.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.912
"Den of iniquity?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.408
"Thousands of teenagers
dance the night away.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.042
"High on amphetamines."

12:40.760 --> 12:43.538
Wigan Casino, as soon as I look old
enough, I'm gonna go down there

12:43.638 --> 12:44.838
and watch a Henderson set.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.083
Be careful with this.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.462
Paul taped it live at Blackpool.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.005
- Yeah?
- It's Ray Henderson's set.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.305
Hello, hello.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.808
Did someone mention amphetamines?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.227
This is John. He just
helped me in a scrap.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.897
Some big bastard from his
school started on me.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.099
He waded in.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.901
Wow! Well done, pal.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.771
You know that graffiti on
the end of Newbold Street?

13:07.871 --> 13:09.647
- Yeah.
- "Burnsworth is a shithole."

13:09.747 --> 13:11.274
- PAUL Yeah.
- It was him. He did it.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.699
What, you wrote that?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.788
Just the shithole bit.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.665
Spot-on, pal.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.166
He must be one of us.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.869
Full of pond life, Burnsworth.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.580
All anyone looks forward
to is going down local.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.123
Not us though, brother?

13:27.223 --> 13:28.625
We're off to the States next year.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.959
The States?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.127
Tell him.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.129
America.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.589
We're going to get records.

13:34.689 --> 13:37.133
They've got warehouses
and basements full of them.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.218
You're joking?

13:38.318 --> 13:41.137
He's got contacts in
Detroit and Chicago.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.979
I'm gonna get tons of
stuff no one's heard.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.023
I'll have everyone begging me to DJ.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.693
Yeah. Can't even get
a spot at youth club.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.446
You watch, I'm working on Tez.
He'll give me a go.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.691
We'll see about that,
you useless bastard.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.409
Hey, are you giving us some or what?

13:56.377 --> 13:57.487
All right.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.663
Got four each, that's your lot.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.625
There you go, pal.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.752
Think you've earned these.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.587
Get 'em down your neck.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.416
What'll happen?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.042
"What'll happen?"

14:11.142 --> 14:14.428
In 45 minutes you'll be into next week.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.723
Well, don't worry.
They're made for fatties to lose weight.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.644
There you go.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.147
I'm going record-hunting
tomorrow in Manchester.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.975
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.275
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.395
See you about 2:00, then.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.987
- All right.
- Yeah.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.573
- Ta-ra.
- See you later.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.534
Oi, knock on back.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.233
Fucking hell!

15:17.333 --> 15:18.533
Fuck.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.707
Hey, let us in.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.925
Visiting time is over!

16:18.561 --> 16:20.255
It's not even dinner time yet!

16:20.355 --> 16:22.173
I said it's over!

16:22.273 --> 16:23.508
Fucking hell!

16:37.872 --> 16:39.072
Hey up, cocker.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.318
Hey, I wanna buy that record. You know,
the first one on Ray Henderson's tape.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.655
It says here, "Cover-Up".
Is that the title?

16:45.755 --> 16:48.164
No, it's a cover-up. I'll come down.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.794
It's a cover-up, it's been covered up.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.873
Cover-up's where the
DJ's hidden the title.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.841
He gets a piece of paper

16:58.601 --> 17:01.170
and it covers up the label,
so no-one else can find it.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.839
Shit! How do I...

17:02.939 --> 17:05.883
If I wanted to go and buy one,
how would I...

17:05.983 --> 17:08.059
How would I know what to ask for.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.271
You wouldn't. Why do you
think I wanna go to America?

17:11.656 --> 17:16.443
It's the only place you can go and find
a record that nobody's heard already.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.564
You're all fired up, aren't you?
How was your night?

17:19.664 --> 17:22.324
I just... I didn't even sleep. I just...

17:22.458 --> 17:23.693
- I get these...
- Tingles.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.528
- Yeah, tingles, down the back of my neck.
- Brilliant.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.739
See these lyrics, right?
I wrote them all down.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.199
They just jumped out at me.
Really grabbed me.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.869
- Tobi Legend?
- Yeah, they really meant something.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.454
Does that sound daft?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.205
- Bloody hell, you have been busy.
- Yeah.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.875
"Life is just one precious minute.
Open up your eyes and see it.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.586
"Give yourself a better chance
because time will pass you..."

17:41.686 --> 17:43.463
- Do you know what I mean?
- I do.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.846
Fucking great.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.133
That's like the great
thing about soul music.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.518
You listen to the lyrics on all
them records and they talk to you.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.318
Detroit, '68, Ric-Tic label.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.618
Like my neck.

18:09.839 --> 18:10.823
Oh, dick.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.625
Hey, Bazz, stick this
on for us, will you?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.962
Put both booths on.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.381
Hey, come on.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.764
Fucking hell, those trumpets!

18:33.070 --> 18:35.271
Hey! Come on, there's tons of stuff.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.566
Cameo-Parkway.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.862
Philadelphia, a mean sound.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.157
And Wand label from New York.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.535
Bloody hell, I'm having that.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.447
That is a great magazine.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.951
It tells you all about soul records
and like, singers and that.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.953
Have a look in back, a fella
called John Anderson.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.413
He owns Soul Bowl Records.

18:58.513 --> 18:59.956
All the top DJs buy from him.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.041
You know, like Ray Henderson.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.626
Move away from this section. Thank you.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.044
Hey, you, fuck off!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.587
We're buying serious stuff here.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.888
You're not the only one
that likes "serious" music.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.300
What're you doing, three weeks Friday?

19:11.400 --> 19:12.719
Piss off, dickhead!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.137
I'm playing soul at the youth club.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.139
Youth club? Have you heard this, Ange?

19:16.239 --> 19:18.690
Hey, I know you. The bus?

19:19.075 --> 19:22.110
- Yeah.
- He always gives up his seat for me.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.814
I wouldn't sit where he's fucking been.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.698
It's always nice and warm.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.952
Come on, Ange. We're not hanging
here with these kiddy-winks.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.126
Who's the black bird?

19:38.386 --> 19:40.621
I see her on the bus every morning.
She's a nurse.

19:40.721 --> 19:45.042
A nurse? Hey, maybe she could see
to this weird swelling I keep getting.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.635
She wouldn't be interested in me anyway.

19:52.066 --> 19:55.185
No, not when your mum's
dressing you in that clobber!

19:58.030 --> 19:59.849
They got them. Brilliant!

19:59.949 --> 20:02.317
Solatios. Fucking best!

20:05.413 --> 20:07.273
I can't pay you back in full.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.783
Don't worry about it. Hey, come on.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.030
Hi, is this Soul Bowl Records?

20:49.832 --> 20:54.035
Hi. Do you have a record by a Lou Pride,
I'm Com'un Home In The Morn'un?

21:06.891 --> 21:09.217
Nice kit! Have you won pools?

21:20.029 --> 21:22.856
Who the fuck are you?
You look nearly as good as me.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.817
Do I look all right?

21:27.828 --> 21:29.279
50% Bruce Lee!

21:30.039 --> 21:33.199
Hey, I got this from Soul
Bowl Records, Lou Pride.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.579
It's on the tape, from the all-nighter,
Ray Henderson's set.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.907
I heard the first ten
seconds or so of it.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.417
Now I've heard the whole thing.
It's great!

21:44.720 --> 21:46.004
Do you want it?

21:46.681 --> 21:48.089
Fucking hell, no. You keep it.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.550
- Take it.
- All right.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.469
It's a fucking great record. Hey.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.267
Come on, we're going for it.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.764
Oi, oi, oi!

22:03.864 --> 22:05.266
Tez's car's broke down.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.143
Oh, yeah? How long will he be?

22:07.243 --> 22:09.235
I don't know. About half hour.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.737
I'll get things going.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.363
You got any charts?

22:13.541 --> 22:16.284
No, I've got loads of soul.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.029
Just wait here, you two, all right?

22:19.248 --> 22:20.489
I'm on.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.617
Are you gonna get on the dance floor?

22:22.717 --> 22:24.493
Hey, this is our chance.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.078
Just give me five minutes.
I've got an idea!

22:26.178 --> 22:29.631
All right, sunshine. Let's have a little
bit of this, shall we, while we wait.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.385
Hey.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.098
Hey, come to the youth club.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.060
Hey, can you dance?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.664
Hey, where've you been?

23:02.965 --> 23:04.916
Been rounding people up to dance.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.702
Rounding people up to dance.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.336
What? Who are they?

23:09.930 --> 23:12.416
I'll tell you in a minute.
You get some soul on or what?

23:12.516 --> 23:14.634
I'm flying. Come on!

23:16.645 --> 23:18.972
Now, it's time for some real music.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.766
It's the moment you've
all been waiting for.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.768
Let's see you on that floor!

23:23.944 --> 23:26.854
It's Frankie Valli's The Night.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.196
You getting on the floor or what?

24:30.845 --> 24:33.087
Hey, mate! You're fucking brilliant!

24:49.905 --> 24:51.640
What a night! What a night!

24:51.740 --> 24:55.943
Did you see some of those moves?
Those Bruce Lee kicks and that! Yeah.

25:07.423 --> 25:11.250
Have you asked your Paul about
me coming to America with you?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.255
- You better get saving up.
- Are you...

25:16.599 --> 25:18.591
Are you serious? I can come with you?

25:18.726 --> 25:21.504
Listen, Terrorist!
If I say we make good team,

25:21.604 --> 25:23.589
I mean we make good team.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.175
I say the three of us,
we could go to States.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.094
Come back with enough unknowns

25:28.194 --> 25:29.845
to give Ray Henderson, or any man,

25:29.945 --> 25:31.312
a good run for his money!

25:31.614 --> 25:33.516
So, we're... We're going?

25:33.616 --> 25:35.316
Yeah. Let's do it.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.186
Let's go to America! Let's do it.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.487
We're going to America! Come on!

25:39.663 --> 25:41.656
Hey. Easy.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.833
Forget the top ten, it's all propaganda.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.502
This is underground,
but it's gonna be massive.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.254
This is...

25:56.430 --> 25:57.706
Shit. What're you doing?

25:57.806 --> 26:00.091
Get on with it. You don't have
to be Jimmy fucking Savile.

26:00.726 --> 26:04.512
This is Lou Pride and I'm
Com'un Home In The Morn'un

27:05.916 --> 27:07.651
Keep these curtains closed.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.862
Everyone in the street can see you.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.621
And keep the noise down!

27:12.089 --> 27:13.748
All right!

27:30.733 --> 27:31.933
Fucking hell!

27:48.917 --> 27:51.111
Well, thanks for letting us know.

27:51.717 --> 27:53.337
Bye, now.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.327
What's going on?

27:58.427 --> 27:59.835
He's gone.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.422
He's passed away in his sleep.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.799
What? Who?

28:05.267 --> 28:07.218
Your granddad.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.804
They said he had a stroke.

28:11.273 --> 28:14.183
He's in a peaceful place now, love.

28:33.796 --> 28:36.205
It's 5:00 in the bloody morning!

28:41.220 --> 28:42.712
What are you doing dressed?

28:43.472 --> 28:45.339
You didn't want him here, did you?

28:47.059 --> 28:50.087
I'll take you to see him if you like.
Before the funeral.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.721
What's going on?

28:53.065 --> 28:55.224
You've got your way now.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.184
There's some tea there.

28:58.112 --> 29:01.022
John, what do you think you're doing?

29:01.490 --> 29:02.982
Just calm down.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.610
He's dead

29:05.953 --> 29:07.820
and neither of you give a fuck!

29:08.914 --> 29:11.233
Don't use language like that in here!

29:11.333 --> 29:13.652
You're a grown man now,
you should be able to control yourself.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.952
Now come on.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.954
Here.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.666
Just drink your tea and calm down.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.746
No, I'm not fucking having it!

29:23.846 --> 29:25.164
- John!
- Look at him!

29:25.264 --> 29:26.464
This is what he does!

29:29.476 --> 29:32.212
He fucking hated that fucking home!

29:32.312 --> 29:34.506
And it's your fucking fault!

29:34.606 --> 29:36.223
Do something!

29:42.114 --> 29:45.316
All right. You have two hours.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.027
Please turn over your paper and begin.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.934
Oi, blockhead. Eyes on your paper.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.233
Do you not hear me, Clark?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.829
Right, sit down. Now!

30:41.423 --> 30:44.625
- Are you deaf? I said...
- Fuck off.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.919
What did you say, lad?

30:48.347 --> 30:51.966
I said fuck off!

31:03.111 --> 31:04.645
That's a fire door!

31:17.417 --> 31:19.660
You'll regret this, Clark!

31:34.059 --> 31:35.926
Someone let me back in.

31:47.781 --> 31:48.981
Here you go, love.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.757
Oi! Oi!

32:21.857 --> 32:24.225
Fucking look at him. Look at him.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.649
Is that the best you can do?

32:38.749 --> 32:41.109
Come on, you fucking bastards!

32:41.209 --> 32:42.778
Right, enough of that.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.870
No more of that language, son.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.580
Fuck off!

33:10.322 --> 33:12.481
Matt, there's a letter here.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.445
- You all right, Ben?
- Matt.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.447
They're not letting us in.
It's that Linda.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.956
She's not putting you on.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.826
What's going on, Linda?

33:30.926 --> 33:32.744
I'm bringing Terry back on tonight.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.997
- Why?
- I'm not having you on them decks any more.

33:35.097 --> 33:36.123
All that swearing.

33:36.223 --> 33:37.666
I've been coming here every
fucking month and doing it!

33:37.766 --> 33:40.252
- What are you on about?
- I've had enough of your antics on that mic

33:40.352 --> 33:42.462
and that music of yours
is just bloody trouble!

33:42.562 --> 33:44.506
Most people came for our music.

33:44.606 --> 33:46.842
Tell her, Terry.
You know they all fucking like it.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.261
I think it were much better when
I was playing charts meself.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.013
What do you know?
You haven't got a fucking clue!

33:51.113 --> 33:52.431
Listen here, you cheeky little git,

33:52.531 --> 33:55.392
the only reason you're on them decks
is because you let my car tyres down!

33:55.492 --> 33:57.269
- I didn't touch your crappy car!
- Yeah, you did!

33:57.369 --> 33:58.687
- You told me you did.
- See!

33:58.787 --> 34:00.564
- Showing off!
- Fuck off, you cretin!

34:00.664 --> 34:03.567
Calm down and you go home now,
or I'll get someone to make you go.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.776
Piss off, you lesbian!

34:05.176 --> 34:07.119
You shit!

34:07.713 --> 34:09.447
- Fuck off!
- What are you doing?

34:10.757 --> 34:12.166
I'm calling the police!

34:19.181 --> 34:21.251
Hey, come on.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.886
Fucking have it!

34:24.603 --> 34:27.674
That fucking nasty bitch don't
know a thing about music!

34:27.774 --> 34:30.052
I'm bringing Terry back on.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.054
I'm gonna torch that shithole.
Who's helping me?

34:32.654 --> 34:34.389
 We'll start our own club.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.891
No more divs on the dance floor,
we can DJ all night long

34:36.992 --> 34:38.859
and play what the fuck we want.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.647
Yeah, but it costs loads of
money to buy a night club.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.531
Bollocks! You rent it.
Get people to pay in.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.109
That pays for it.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.235
Yeah, and the money we make,
we put towards America.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.536
Brilliant!

34:49.838 --> 34:51.406
You're not in on it, pal.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.708
I know. Me and Bruiser
are going on our own.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.079
Well, pipe down. I were on a roll then.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.805
Sorry, man.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.799
Yes! Now you're talking!

35:02.350 --> 35:04.753
Our Paul knows of a club with
an ace wooden dance floor.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.214
That's what we want, none of
this shitty concrete crap.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.091
- Yeah, a proper dance floor.
- Yeah.

35:09.191 --> 35:10.759
Yeah. Fucking yeah!

35:14.196 --> 35:18.232
All right, I'll just go and get him.
He's out in the back making a phone call.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.852
Are you two promoters?

35:20.952 --> 35:23.237
- Yeah.
- How old are you?

35:23.497 --> 35:24.773
I'm 18, he's 18.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.907
OK, I'll go and get him.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.576
It's a great dance floor.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.416
I can see meself up here.

35:37.219 --> 35:39.253
Dance floor full of fit birds.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.665
Lou Pride playing top blast!

35:41.765 --> 35:44.292
- Get down, you dick.
- The queue a mile long outside!

35:44.392 --> 35:47.629
"Matty, Matty, Julie and Tracy are
at the door. They can't get in.

35:47.729 --> 35:50.431
"Can you come and let them in? Please?"

35:50.690 --> 35:51.890
Oh, shit.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.226
All right?

35:56.655 --> 35:58.230
Where's your fucking dad?

35:59.032 --> 36:00.899
Who are you, Baby Face Nelson?

36:01.576 --> 36:02.776
Sorry, girls.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.980
Come back when your balls have dropped.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.148
We're 18!

36:06.248 --> 36:09.366
18? It's 21 you have to be!

36:09.584 --> 36:11.486
My brother's 21 , he's doing it with us.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.156
- So where is he, then?
- He's coming in a bit.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.086
Don't waste my fucking time, eh?

36:21.721 --> 36:24.548
Rita! Where's that fucking delivery?

36:24.724 --> 36:27.801
All right, I've been on
the phone. Don't worry.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.175
Well, why didn't you find out
the age thing was 21 first?

36:33.275 --> 36:35.093
I didn't think about it.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.644
It's all right. Our Paul
will sort it, you'll see.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.481
Get off me! You fucking bastards!

36:40.699 --> 36:41.899
Get off...

36:43.243 --> 36:44.443
Paul!

36:44.786 --> 36:46.570
Paul, what's happening?

36:47.122 --> 36:48.655
What's going on?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.074
Paul?

36:51.126 --> 36:52.860
I'll get you out.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.368
He might not get out for months.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.919
What are we gonna do?

37:02.470 --> 37:05.422
We need more records before
we start our own club anyway.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.626
Jesus! When did you decide that?

37:07.726 --> 37:10.511
Fucking hell, you're doing
it again, you dick!

37:12.230 --> 37:15.682
All right, you! Twice in one day!

37:15.984 --> 37:18.018
Follow me, the pair of you!

37:19.070 --> 37:20.972
No bloody gumption.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.892
Too busy thinking about
going out every night!

37:23.992 --> 37:27.813
What this country needs is another
bloody war to shape you lot.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.113
Come on!

37:29.414 --> 37:31.399
You! You're on deliveries!

37:31.499 --> 37:34.535
And you! You're in oven room.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.537
With my little friend.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.724
Who are you?

37:58.818 --> 38:01.471
I've been sent down here by Yarwood.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.272
He wants me to work in here.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.156
Don't open the fucking door!

38:20.256 --> 38:22.124
- I thought...
- Sit!

38:39.025 --> 38:41.810
Jesus fucking Christ!

38:46.658 --> 38:48.018
Fancy a fucking go, do you?

38:48.118 --> 38:50.485
No. No, look.

39:03.425 --> 39:06.418
Oi! Oi, oi, Matt, Matt,
Matt, this is Sean!

39:06.761 --> 39:09.122
He's one of us! Hey, check out his tat.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.124
- Hey. You want a pint?
- I'm fine, thanks.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.467
Stay here, mate, I'll get them in.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.346
So what's your name, then, sweetheart?

39:17.731 --> 39:19.299
What you doing with that crazy bastard?

39:19.399 --> 39:21.308
He bit a bloke's ear off last year.

39:22.902 --> 39:26.313
What would you do if some bloke
came at you with a fucking shovel?

39:26.781 --> 39:28.482
- You drunk?
- No.

39:30.084 --> 39:33.313
- What's a cockney doing up here?
- He moved for the music.

39:33.413 --> 39:35.190
The lads upstairs say he's on the run.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.193
Doing someone in. He changed
his name and everything.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.286
He's going to Wigan. Wigan!

39:41.629 --> 39:42.913
- Tonight!
- Yeah.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.700
Ray fucking Henderson's gonna be playing.
He said we could go with him.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.869
You do what you like, I'm off.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.412
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.712
What?

39:51.598 --> 39:53.799
He can help us get our club going.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.801
He's well fucking old.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.344
Our Paul's out soon!

39:58.813 --> 39:59.839
Fuck off. Fuck off.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.509
- Matt!
- The fucking tits on that, mate.

40:02.609 --> 40:03.850
Get them down you.

40:05.820 --> 40:10.016
Do you fancy coming back to
ours and play a few records

40:10.116 --> 40:12.859
- before heading out?
- Yeah, why not, mate.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.828
- Here you go, mate.
- Thanks.

40:28.635 --> 40:29.835
Here you go, mate.

40:30.845 --> 40:31.913
You can have them for nowt.

40:32.013 --> 40:34.089
- Thanks.
- Them will last you a couple of weeks.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.251
Don't do more than four tonight,
they're pretty strong.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.926
And listen, a word of advice.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.839
Don't go on the needle. Once you get
into that, there's no coming back.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.424
- The needle?
- Injecting.

40:42.524 --> 40:43.925
It's for fucking divs.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.059
All right, cheers, I'll go easy.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.027
This is gonna be a great night, boys!

41:02.127 --> 41:04.571
We're fucking going! Finally!

41:04.671 --> 41:07.449
This tape's fucking ace. Who made it?

41:07.549 --> 41:10.201
We did, it's our set, me and John.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.121
We double deck together.
We're invincible, aren't we?

41:13.221 --> 41:16.048
Who bought this one, then? Exus Trek?

41:16.349 --> 41:18.717
- He did. Matt.
- Put it there, mate.

41:19.853 --> 41:22.130
Look? This is in my top three.

41:22.230 --> 41:23.472
Fucking hell!

41:23.690 --> 41:25.884
Oh, bollocks!

41:25.984 --> 41:27.809
- What's up?
- We need petrol.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.771
There's a station in about a mile.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.276
Hang on. I'm going to pull in here.

41:37.203 --> 41:40.315
Siphon some petrol from that
poxy fucking van back there.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.737
Hey. Under le' Well.
What a fucking name.

41:45.837 --> 41:49.289
Where the fuck are we?

42:02.020 --> 42:03.220
Hey.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.341
Who needs talcum powder on your soles,

42:06.441 --> 42:08.676
when you've got this much fucking rain.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.343
It's slippery.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.938
Hey, check out this spin.

42:17.619 --> 42:19.354
Who are you fucking looking at?

42:19.454 --> 42:21.655
Come to do ballet dancing
at the Casino, have we?

42:21.789 --> 42:23.281
Fucking queers!

42:23.416 --> 42:25.367
I could punch your fucking lights out,

42:25.543 --> 42:27.994
while kicking the crap
out of lanky here.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.031
Same fucking time...

42:30.131 --> 42:31.456
Twat!

42:32.592 --> 42:33.827
Prick!

42:33.927 --> 42:35.502
Come on! Get in!

42:37.388 --> 42:39.840
Come on, then, you fucking bastards!

42:40.225 --> 42:41.376
Dickhead!

42:41.476 --> 42:43.510
Get in the fucking car!

42:45.730 --> 42:47.013
Fucking in-breds!

42:48.733 --> 42:50.475
Bastards!

42:50.652 --> 42:52.720
Oh, fuck me, they were some moves.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.389
Did you see him, the scary bastard?

42:54.489 --> 42:56.891
- Never underestimate anyone in a fight.
- Yeah.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.018
Get in first, bang them
as hard as you can.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.354
It all happened so fast.
I didn't have any time to react.

43:01.454 --> 43:04.030
Speed makes you fast.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.526
Just have some more,
you've had fuck all.

43:06.626 --> 43:07.902
I've already had a couple.

43:08.002 --> 43:09.404
Four more won't do you any harm.

43:09.504 --> 43:11.072
Go on, the one's you've had
already would have kicked in

43:11.172 --> 43:12.372
by now if they were any good.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.292
Go on, have a few more. Take these.

43:15.677 --> 43:17.412
It feels fucking great!

43:17.512 --> 43:18.913
- Go on!
- Hey, watch the road, you.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.915
- All right!
- John, this is it.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.008
We're finally going to
go see Ray Henderson!

43:36.364 --> 43:39.816
Truly lonely..

43:44.956 --> 43:45.982
She's here!

43:46.082 --> 43:48.450
The nurse, Angela! Look!

43:48.835 --> 43:51.196
She's got a bloke. Ugly fucking lump.

43:51.296 --> 43:53.114
Wait till we get in there.

43:53.214 --> 43:54.616
Ten-a-penny birds like her.

43:54.716 --> 43:56.618
Falling over to get
themselves a lad like you.

43:56.718 --> 43:58.752
Shut up, you queer bastards.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.087
Hey!

44:08.187 --> 44:09.964
Yes, boys, Frank and Phil.

44:14.110 --> 44:16.304
All right! What time do you call this?
What's happening?

44:16.404 --> 44:19.064
Keep your hair on. Just sorted
out some right Herberts!

44:19.282 --> 44:20.899
Looks like you fucking
brought them with you!

44:21.075 --> 44:23.811
Don't be rude. That's Matt and John.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.480
Well into the scene they are.

44:25.580 --> 44:27.239
Be nice. Don't bite.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.193
Frank...

44:32.086 --> 44:34.079
Are you all right?

44:35.506 --> 44:36.998
You all right?

44:40.094 --> 44:41.294
Wait.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.131
Hurry up...

44:52.607 --> 44:54.266
What are they doing?

44:55.068 --> 44:56.643
Speed. They're going in on a needle.

44:57.570 --> 44:58.770
Come on.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.183
Are you fucking ready for this?

45:02.283 --> 45:04.317
Are you fucking ready?

45:07.121 --> 45:08.321
Yeah!

45:17.465 --> 45:18.665
Back up!

45:19.634 --> 45:20.702
Get in!

45:22.553 --> 45:24.212
What? What are you going to do?

45:25.264 --> 45:27.841
Yes, yes. Calm down.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.260
He's got tickets!

45:34.690 --> 45:36.592
The crown of Detroit soul.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.728
This is Mr Duke Browner.

47:48.449 --> 47:49.892
What's up with him?

47:49.992 --> 47:52.520
Don't know. He's got a
bonk-on over the records.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.112
He's got a bit of a problem.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.992
Sweet baby Jesus! Have you seen him?

47:59.252 --> 48:01.077
Dances like a diva!

48:01.963 --> 48:04.038
I need to go to the bogs for water.

48:04.382 --> 48:07.201
Can you not wait? Bloody hell,
you're covered in sweat!

48:07.301 --> 48:10.336
I'll be back. In a minute, I'll be back.

48:23.734 --> 48:26.220
You look like a willing
dance floor to me!

48:26.320 --> 48:29.390
You've got me, Ray Henderson,
for the next hour!

48:32.493 --> 48:34.944
Let's start as we mean to go on.

48:35.538 --> 48:39.282
Gwen Owens, Wanted [And Needed]!

49:10.197 --> 49:13.733
- Have you seen John?
- Yes, mate, fucking brilliant!

49:17.371 --> 49:18.439
Get off him!

49:18.539 --> 49:20.657
John! You OK?

49:21.292 --> 49:22.492
John!

49:29.425 --> 49:31.744
You've got to help John, he's dying.

49:31.844 --> 49:33.795
- What? Where is he?
- John's dying!

49:38.017 --> 49:40.218
- Can you hear me?
- He had a few pills before.

49:40.394 --> 49:42.296
How much? A lot?

49:42.396 --> 49:44.764
I don't know. A few.

49:44.982 --> 49:48.101
Go to entrance and get them
to call an ambulance! Now!

49:50.071 --> 49:51.396
Fucking hell!

49:57.912 --> 50:00.523
My friend's collapsed in the bogs.

50:00.623 --> 50:03.067
- What?
- My friend's collapsed in the bogs.

50:03.167 --> 50:05.577
All right, I'll sort it.
But I want him out.

50:24.313 --> 50:26.007
What's going on? Where is he?

50:26.107 --> 50:28.342
Relax, look over there.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.894
He's dancing.

50:45.668 --> 50:48.870
- John!
- What a fucking night!

50:52.091 --> 50:53.159
I thought you were dying.

50:53.259 --> 50:55.369
I've never felt so fucking alive!

50:55.469 --> 50:58.372
This is the country's
top sound right now!

50:58.472 --> 51:01.417
So all you bootleggers can back off!

51:01.517 --> 51:03.676
No prisoners tonight.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.221
The cover-up!

51:10.651 --> 51:13.311
This bloke is fucking brilliant!

51:57.782 --> 52:00.233
Bombers, green-and-clears, riccas.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.228
Get on, you twat!

52:02.328 --> 52:04.021
Come on, get it together,
if you want a lift.

52:04.121 --> 52:05.272
We're going to the Stoke all-dayer!

52:05.372 --> 52:07.108
Give us some of that gear
before it wears off!

52:07.208 --> 52:09.985
Amphet, come on, anything.
Sean's got loads of it in the back.

52:10.085 --> 52:11.285
Come on.

52:16.717 --> 52:19.419
Will you keep your gob
shut about taking gear?

52:20.304 --> 52:22.547
Sorry, pal. It were a joke.

52:22.807 --> 52:24.257
We weren't thinking.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.592
- See him?
- Who?

52:27.436 --> 52:28.921
He's Old Bill.

52:29.021 --> 52:31.973
He never buys gear, never dances,
never buys records.

52:32.191 --> 52:34.767
His tattoo on his hand, see it?

52:35.069 --> 52:36.220
Yeah.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.104
I'm certain when Frank
sold him gear last week,

52:38.405 --> 52:41.190
that Lancashire rose, it was
stronger-looking with thicker lines.

52:41.325 --> 52:44.027
- Why did he sell him the gear?
- Well, he looked spot-on.

52:44.411 --> 52:46.647
Then we all noticed he wasn't
in a hurry to neck his gear,

52:46.747 --> 52:49.824
so now, I've been
watching him ever since.

52:51.544 --> 52:53.154
Hey, get in Frank, Phil.

52:53.254 --> 52:55.614
Come on, knees up,
make room for two little-uns.

52:55.714 --> 52:58.117
What are we waiting for?
Going to Stoke, aren't we?

52:58.217 --> 53:01.162
You two again?
Hanging around full-time now?

53:01.262 --> 53:02.621
Hey, I'd watch him.

53:41.135 --> 53:42.627
Fuck!

53:47.933 --> 53:49.675
How much will you give me for it?

53:49.935 --> 53:52.011
Breaking my heart with this one.
A pound.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.350
Oi, lads!

54:04.650 --> 54:06.894
Hey, I've got some stuff
right up your street.

54:06.994 --> 54:08.604
Straight from the States, like.

54:08.704 --> 54:10.154
Hey, hang on. Take that.

54:10.998 --> 54:12.691
We're going to lose the girls. Come on.

54:12.791 --> 54:15.361
I've got plenty more where they
came from, and on that same label.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.947
Well, I'm in the Navy, aren't I?
So I pick them up and stuff, you know.

54:18.047 --> 54:19.240
The name's Tezza, this is my address.

54:19.340 --> 54:21.992
If you want to come back and get some more,
you know where to find me, yeah?

54:22.092 --> 54:23.292
Thanks.

54:23.636 --> 54:25.837
Give us all of it. Sixty quid.

54:49.703 --> 54:51.070
OK.

55:28.909 --> 55:30.443
She's eying you up again, pal.

55:30.869 --> 55:32.236
Go on.

55:49.096 --> 55:52.256
Get in. The place is crawling
with plain-clothed coppers.

55:59.064 --> 56:00.306
What's wrong?

56:01.817 --> 56:03.267
It's that black girl, ain't it?

56:03.819 --> 56:05.811
Nice old girl, I'd bang her one.

56:12.286 --> 56:14.028
Just won the dance competition!

56:14.371 --> 56:15.947
Dance competition?

56:16.498 --> 56:17.650
Didn't know they even had them.

56:17.750 --> 56:20.152
Listen, mate, I don't know who
you are, but do yourself a favour,

56:20.252 --> 56:22.286
put that away, it's embarrassing.

56:24.965 --> 56:28.668
Jesus! Who's organising
fucking dance competitions?

56:29.136 --> 56:30.503
His face.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.047
We might as well go to fucking Butlins!

56:45.027 --> 56:47.478
Hey, look what Angela gave us.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.190
It gives a description of every drug.

56:51.575 --> 56:53.859
Bombers, green-and-clears...

56:53.994 --> 56:57.196
It's written by doctors,
pharmacists, and that.

56:59.625 --> 57:01.158
Why did she give you that?

57:01.293 --> 57:02.535
I think it was meant for you.

57:03.295 --> 57:06.372
So you don't go and take the
wrong thing, collapsing again.

57:08.634 --> 57:10.084
What's up with you anyway?

57:10.928 --> 57:13.539
Right, if you did a
less fucking pharmacy,

57:13.639 --> 57:15.423
we might be able to get our club going.

57:16.517 --> 57:18.293
I know you've been injecting as well.

57:18.393 --> 57:20.219
What's it to you if I've been injecting?

57:20.354 --> 57:21.588
It's no different having pills.

57:23.982 --> 57:25.392
We're in at the Polish Club?

57:26.527 --> 57:28.512
Hey, he's been down and done the deal.

57:28.612 --> 57:30.855
Our Paul's out in a few weeks,
he's doing it with us.

57:31.990 --> 57:33.316
What's that?

57:33.951 --> 57:35.185
Fucking MIMS?

57:35.285 --> 57:37.069
I told you to keep it quiet.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.739
Fucking idiot!

57:41.708 --> 57:42.818
Oh!

57:42.918 --> 57:43.902
Fuck!

57:44.402 --> 57:45.863
Jesus! Did you see that?

57:45.963 --> 57:47.788
Well, yeah, you've pissed
him right off now.

57:48.090 --> 57:49.575
We can't wait for Paul.

57:49.675 --> 57:51.243
You've been stalling anyway.

57:51.343 --> 57:53.085
Paul could be months.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.004
We start in a fucking week.

57:56.932 --> 57:59.752
This is what we've been working towards.
It's our fucking time!

57:59.852 --> 58:01.218
What's the matter with you?

58:16.952 --> 58:20.237
I've been sitting here an
hour now, with no visitor.

58:21.915 --> 58:24.283
You're making me look
like a fucking mick!

58:28.422 --> 58:29.872
What the fuck is that you're in?

58:32.843 --> 58:35.162
- A coat.
- Yeah, I know it's a coat.

58:35.262 --> 58:36.622
It's my fucking coat.

58:36.722 --> 58:37.922
Borrowed it.

58:38.390 --> 58:40.000
Have you?

58:40.100 --> 58:41.585
Well, you look after it.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.469
Genuine Italian is that.

58:44.938 --> 58:46.423
How's that mate of yours, anyway?

58:49.651 --> 58:52.645
- What's that supposed to be?
- Terror-wrist.

58:53.197 --> 58:54.980
Terrorist. It's a fucking joke.

58:55.115 --> 58:56.399
Fucking hell...

58:56.533 --> 58:59.436
- What are you "fucking hell" for?
- I shouldn't have to explain it, should I?

58:59.536 --> 59:00.938
Cheer up, will you?

59:01.038 --> 59:03.072
It should be me
that's pissed off, not you.

59:04.166 --> 59:06.200
I hope you haven't been
getting in any trouble.

59:07.628 --> 59:09.912
I can't help you in here, can I?

59:18.113 --> 59:19.630
Where you been?

59:20.140 --> 59:21.382
Just met with that sailor kid.

59:21.642 --> 59:23.335
I bought everything he had for a fiver.

59:23.435 --> 59:25.845
I'm probably going to
sell most of it, though.

59:31.777 --> 59:33.144
You know what?

59:34.363 --> 59:35.771
Take a couple.

59:36.657 --> 59:39.525
Sell them and put them towards
your money for America.

59:44.373 --> 59:47.032
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm nearly there now.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.453
Thanks, pal.

59:50.754 --> 59:53.414
Fucking hell.

59:54.341 --> 59:56.118
How much have you got saved?

59:56.218 --> 59:59.003
I don't know, it'll help, though.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.253
Matt!

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.714
- Matt, come here!
- Fucking cover-up!

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.924
You got it, John! What's it called?

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:14.810
It's The Salvadors and Stick
By Me, Baby We've got it!

01:00:15.988 --> 01:00:18.307
Yes, we've got it.
We got the fucking cover-up!

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:19.766
Ray Henderson!

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.401
- We've caught you!
- We fucking got it!

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.280
Fucking hell!

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.910
Roll up, come on. Polish Club!

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.828
Next Friday, ninth of October.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:42.379
Ray Henderson's cover-up
will be revealed.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.675
Go on. In you get.
Doubles for you, sweetheart.

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:30.344
Fucking hell, Ange.
You're dropping them.

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:32.506
It's not my fault!

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:35.516
Shit! Just fucking pick them up,
put your hand out...

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:37.476
Come on out, this is the management!

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.720
- Shit!
- Shit.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.021
Shit, fucking hell!
I knew this would happen.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.522
How about a couple of them for me?

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.614
Oh, you fucking dick!

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:55.070
I'll deal with you in a minute.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.656
Angie, listen, I need to speak to you.

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:59.665
- You know my mate, John?
- Yeah.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.537
- He's got a bit of a soft spot for you.
- Oh, Angie!

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.581
Hey, shut up, you.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.048
This is serious.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.175
He can't even dance when you're around.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:12.838
Ever since you and that
ugly bastard split,

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.756
he's been trying to work up the
courage up to talk to you.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:17.050
Well, that "ugly bastard"
and me are still good friends,

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.218
so you better watch your mouth.

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:20.721
Yeah, you better watch your
fucking mouth, curly top!

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.180
Lanky twat!

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.809
Your mate's quite cute and
he's an all right dancer.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.686
But there's something
not quite right about him.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:29.771
- Well, what's that, then?
- I know what it is.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:32.781
It's you. It's the fact that
you hang around with him.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.701
- You're right, that's exactly what it is.
- Have a shit!

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.505
You'll never guess.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.585
The girls are coming back to
our house for a party after.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.462
- What, Angela?
- Yeah.

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:54.671
You winding me up?

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.006
No, I'm not.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.556
He's here, by the door.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:00.893
Put it on now!

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.398
Listen, bastards,

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:09.777
we're gonna play a record you've all
heard Ray Henderson play before,

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.488
and so far there's only one copy.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.609
By next week, every fucker
will be chasing a copy!

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:18.744
So stay on the floor, bog trotters,
or fuck off home now!

01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:22.414
This is a record on Wise
World and it's by...

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:23.746
Come on!

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.461
Wait for it...

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.298
It's by...

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:36.129
The Salvadors and Stick By Me, Baby.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.198
We're on fucking fire, us!

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.783
Untouchable!

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:04.498
He's leaving.

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:13.132
Hey, Ray!

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:16.545
Hi. I'm John.

01:04:16.645 --> 01:04:17.838
Thanks for coming down.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:19.464
Hey up, you.

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:22.307
You got me. Well done.

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:25.429
So where did you find it?

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.889
It was an accident.
It was just a job lot.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.266
An accident?

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.650
I've seen you knocking about,
selling your stuff.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.019
You obviously know your audience.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.737
Nowt compared to you.

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:40.068
I don't suppose there's a chance of
getting a spot at your do, is there?

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.195
You cheeky, young fucker.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.531
You've not been DJ-ing
more than two minutes.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:45.699
Fuck off!

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:48.076
- We could do you a tape.
- Who's "we"?

01:04:48.176 --> 01:04:49.244
Me and Matt, we double up.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:52.379
This is Billy Butler
and The Right Track.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:54.506
So stay on the floor, bastards!

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.420
He's great! He gets the floor going.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.679
All that heckling and
swearing on the mic.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.182
Who's he think he is?
Bernard fucking Manning?

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:05.517
If I were you, mate, I'd lose him.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.681
I'll tell you what, John.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:12.767
I'll see about letting you do
the first half hour next week.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:14.728
And I don't want any
of that shit on the mic.

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:16.188
We'll take it from there.

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:17.529
The warm-up?

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.276
That would be great.

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:22.576
Thanks!

01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:25.370
- See you later, then.
- Thanks!

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.080
I'm trying to get my
hands on some gear...

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.964
- You what?
- You got pills, haven't you?

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:38.210
I spoke to Ray.
He's giving me the warm-up!

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:39.544
No, mate, can't help you.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:42.088
There was a tall lad out
there with curly hair.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:44.591
He said you have bombers,
I could do with some.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.391
You know anyone selling, do you?

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.019
- No, not in here.
- Well, lad...

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.139
If you do know anyone, do let me know.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.856
No problem. What's your name, mate?

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.643
Ben.

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:56.401
All right, Ben.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.780
That's squad.

01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:02.442
Plain clothes?

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:03.735
It's the first fucking night.

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:06.112
I've just had him in here
with Mr Lancashire Rose.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.489
It's that daft twat,

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:09.366
he's told everyone in
fucking Manchester.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.500
He might as well announce it
on the bastard mic.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.261
Hey, Sean says last record.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.012
We can play at least three more.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.766
Hey, come on, don't piss him off.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.143
All right, whatever he says!

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:35.440
We're leaving you with
Frankie Valli's The Night,

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:38.353
but we don't want it
to be the last record,

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.813
and neither do you.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:42.906
So we're carrying on
at 12 Alfred Street!

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.284
Run back to our house.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.614
Don't fucking announce
your address on the mic.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.783
The filth are going to be crawling
all over you from now on!

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:53.417
It's too late now, pal!

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:00.667
Is he paranoid or what?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.377
He might have a point.

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:04.094
Don't talk shit.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.917
John! Sorry, mate.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.828
The girls are in the
kitchen on their own.

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:39.212
Oh, God.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.509
Get in there.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:54.436
Oi!

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.314
Get off those undies!

01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:01.652
You touch my undies again,
I'll sort you right out.

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:04.105
I'll touch your undies whenever I like.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.697
Will you?

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.201
All right. You, out!

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.787
Come on, trouble, you're helping me DJ.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.962
Did you plan that?

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:26.920
No, it was him. He's just...

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.179
He's daft, isn't he?

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.225
- Come here.
- What?

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.688
Come here. I want you to look at me.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.868
Betty reckons you fancy me.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:58.082
How does she know that?

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.877
Why do you keep winking at me, then?

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:05.756
I've just had something in
my eye all night, that's all.

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:14.050
All right, I might like you a bit.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.100
You hardly know me.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.182
I don't know any girls like you.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.941
Oh, what, black?

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.779
No, neither do I.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.192
What, you don't know any lads like me?

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:32.318
No, you twit.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.453
I don't know anyone black.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:38.122
Well, apart from a few faces
here and there in the crowd.

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:39.916
Are you adopted?

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:43.203
No, my dad's American,
he went back before I were born.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.999
American? I'm going to America soon.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.251
Maybe you could go get
him and bring him back.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.676
He's living in Chicago now.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:54.256
Came over in the forces,
they fell in... Well, lust,

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:57.350
had me, then he buggered off and left.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:05.650
I don't know why anyone
would want to leave you?

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.363
Oh, I don't know,

01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:13.700
maybe because my mum
can be a bit of a cow.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.669
What's your favourite record?

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.432
All right, Matt, you gonna get
coupled with that, are you?

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:47.150
Angela!

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.612
- Is Angela in here?
- No.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.899
Get out my house!

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:54.901
- Oi, Angela!
- What the fuck are you doing here?

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.153
- She's with him now.
- Move out the fucking way!

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.113
She doesn't even want you.

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:03.076
Stop it. Stop it! Leave him alone.
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:05.286
- Fucking div.
- What are you doing?

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:06.628
What?

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.249
- I'll fucking do you, dickhead!
- Get out!

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:10.549
Fuck off!

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:16.555
- John! John!
- Jesus!

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:19.858
There's someone trying to break in.

01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:22.894
There's someone's trying to break in.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:42.747
It's me, you fucking simpletons.

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:45.333
Fuck.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:51.214
I'm checking for the escape routes.

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.376
- What the fuck is he on?
- If anyone comes,

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.260
we get out through the roof.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.773
I've been in a fucking shed all night.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:11.568
The squad's watching my place.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:14.188
They're closing in on everyone.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:15.614
Fucking bastards!

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.699
I need to stay here for a while.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:19.743
OK.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.705
Hey, there's a strange-looking
car outside the house.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.000
It's mine, I borrowed it.

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:31.129
Look, I'm fucking shattered.
I'm going to bed.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:35.634
Yeah, me, too.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.387
Do you need anything?

01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:41.097
No, mate, cheers.

01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:43.350
You go to bed.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:24.599
Are you all right?

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:28.687
Frank's dead!

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:30.556
What?

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:32.600
The police ambushed us last night.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.812
Got me, Phil and Frank
trapped in the front room.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:39.531
Smashed the windows.
Came through, dogs and all.

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:43.736
Frank's been fucked in the head a while,

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.571
he'd just jacked up, grabbed the gun,

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.039
and shot himself in the mouth,
like they do in the films.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:52.495
While the Old Bill were panicking,
I managed to get out.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.080
Oh, my God...

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.722
Don't tell him.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.642
And don't tell anyone I'm here.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.603
No, you're safe.

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:14.899
Fuck!

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:26.571
How long till this trip
to the States, then?

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:30.206
A couple of months.
I'm just waiting for him.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.834
I need a few months.

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:35.253
Well, how short are you?

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.339
I want to go travel agents this week.

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:39.215
Can't you wait?

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:41.676
Well, how long do you need?

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.549
If you are in that much of a
fucking hurry, go on your own.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:49.934
I knew it! You've saved fuck all.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:53.556
It's all right, I'll go on my own.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.607
I'll come with you.

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:59.228
I'm gonna off-load the big stuff in the
next week and get the fuck out of here

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.064
before the squad get me.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.198
- Yeah?
- Yes, mate.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.469
Marvin Gaye?

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:26.971
Yeah, I got it off that sailor kid.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:29.884
You've had some fucking gear.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:31.094
How else am I gonna have a good time?

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:34.514
Look at these fucking lumps, not one
of them can dance to save their lives.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:36.272
For fuck's sake!

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.517
Look at him!

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:38.851
He's having a fucking go!

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.443
Bollocks to them, they're not worthy!

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.355
Where's your rhythm?

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:44.982
What are you doing?
An Irish fucking jig?

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:51.030
I'll leave you with my mate here to
play you the kind of stuff you like.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.831
Tried and tested crap.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:55.708
Fuck off!

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:03.007
What're you thinking bringing him on?

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:07.053
What did I tell you, lad? I don't
want any of that shit on the mic!

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.632
This is your break. You asked me
for a break. I'm giving it to you.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.342
You've got one shot, lad.

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:12.851
What's going on, boy?

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:15.138
- I haven't...
- What he saying?

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.181
- You're off.
- We're a partnership.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.516
Tell him.

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:19.600
Listen, you!

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.853
This is Northern Soul,
not Northern Arsehole!

01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:23.771
John, you've got ten minutes to fix it.

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:27.240
And you, you've got ten seconds
to leave this building.

01:16:29.377 --> 01:16:30.945
You gonna let him speak to us like that?

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.287
Us?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.825
I'm the one that plays tried
and tested crap, remember.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.667
You played Marvin fucking Gaye!

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:39.579
Who fucking cares?

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:41.914
They loved it and they've never
fucking heard it before.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.299
Them? They know fuck all.

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:45.960
I don't know whether you've noticed,

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.845
but we're fucking playing for them!
We're not playing for you!

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:52.348
You'll never get anywhere
crowd-pleasing, you dickhead.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.829
- What's he playing at?
- I don't know.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.968
Fucking hell.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:02.794
What a mess.

01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:05.922
Sorry, mate, missed it.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.508
Had to sit here for a bit.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.510
Clear my head.

01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.387
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:14.632
Yeah, I know the whole
thing were a disaster.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:15.841
No!

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.010
No, I was just gonna say I
thought you were all right.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.553
I was surprised.

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:20.979
Really?

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.606
Thanks.

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:25.441
I'm just going to go see Ray.

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.151
Get in there.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.610
Oi, where do you think you're going?

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.153
Hi, I'm Matt.

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:37.446
Used to be your partner.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.788
Yeah, used to be.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.584
You got one big record that
someone else discovered.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.161
You think you can get me out now?

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:45.746
At least I've got one!

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:47.498
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:49.542
You're a shit DJ.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:51.509
You've got a load of shit records!

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.345
Even if you did have a good one,
you wouldn't fucking know it!

01:18:54.605 --> 01:18:55.888
Fucking wanker!

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:03.014
Hey!

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:05.391
See that skinny twat,
get him out of there!

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:07.018
- Come on, posh twat!
- Hey!

01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:09.228
- You're nothing without me, John!
- Come on.

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:11.689
- Fuck off!
- You're a fucking asshole!

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.066
- Come on, John!
- Fucking asshole.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.611
If I see you fucking again,
I'll break your fucking legs.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:19.203
Now, fuck off!

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.542
Look at the state of that lot.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.965
I'm worried about the
rest of my records.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:33.801
Gonna try and get back
before him and grab them.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:35.254
Good plan. Come on.

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.555
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:51.402
There's someone in there.

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:56.150
That's them! Come on, get after them!

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:03.157
If they find this lot,
we'll both get ten years!

01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:05.124
A gun! What the fuck!

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:08.454
Go on, get out! Just lie
low for a few days.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:10.289
Just come with me, just leave
it all here. Leave everything.

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.083
No, mate, I wanna make
some money on this lot.

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:13.793
We'll be in the States
before you know it.

01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:15.711
- Are you sure?
- Yes, mate, now go while you can!

01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:18.888
Fuck. Fucking drive!

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.525
Come on, move it!

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.821
I fucking knew it.

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:28.499
Jesus, Sean...

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:30.001
Fuck.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.479
Oh, Sean...

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.858
Come on.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.106
Sean, come on!

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:00.698
Get up!

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:05.703
Sean. No, please...

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.207
Please don't die. Please don't die.

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:12.335
Are you all right, mate?

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:14.504
Hey!

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:18.090
Where you going? Oi!

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.430
You're still in shock, youth.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.273
Get that down your neck.

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:22.280
You all right, John?

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.450
I didn't see you over there.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.209
This is horrible, isn't it?

01:23:41.809 --> 01:23:44.969
I'll have a rum and pep.
A pint of bitter.

01:23:48.691 --> 01:23:50.474
Here's your rum and pep.

01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:58.475
I'll get these.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.151
And there's your pint of bitter.

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:02.778
Is that it? A quid?

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.158
What do you want?

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.494
Well?

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.705
You know, it wasn't paranoia.

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:16.250
Coppers were all over him,
thanks to you.

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:20.087
You just

01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:24.467
couldn't stop bragging, could you?

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:35.811
Cos that's what killed him.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.023
Your gob.

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:58.786
That was James Fountain's
Seven Day Lover.

01:24:58.886 --> 01:25:02.338
And as we lost our close friend,
this was Sean's favourite record.

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:07.628
Luther Ingram Orchestra and Exus Trek.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:16.102
There he is. You all right, Matt?

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:18.555
You all right, mate?

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:19.855
Matt?

01:26:01.365 --> 01:26:03.065
Fuck!

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.468
Do you want a lift somewhere?

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:35.514
Come on.

01:27:05.012 --> 01:27:06.670
This is gonna be a great night, boys!

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.775
I want you to come back with me.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:42.206
I'll just take you back, then, shall I?

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:46.210
Yeah.

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:44.018
- If you want...
- Yeah.

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:49.273
Are you all right?

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:52.253
Hey, wake up, gorgeous.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.518
You all right?

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:10.604
I was dreaming that you
were still kissing me.

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:13.524
It was really nice.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:24.994
- What? What?
- Your hair smells, what is it?

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:28.073
It's nit shampoo.

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.624
I've been staying at Stee's.
His whole family got head lice.

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.244
- Fucking hundreds of them.
- Oh.

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:34.287
God, you scumball, get away.

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:37.833
- A few nits.
- No! Get off!

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:39.209
Get off me.

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:41.336
You knobhead, get away.

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:16.670
Yeah, come in.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.547
Come on.

01:31:34.573 --> 01:31:36.391
I saw Matt yesterday.

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:38.734
He started a new job working on roads.

01:31:39.394 --> 01:31:41.737
You and him were best mates.

01:31:42.455 --> 01:31:46.116
And when things were good,
you were dynamite together.

01:31:46.293 --> 01:31:48.619
You should get him to
go America with you.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:50.197
America?

01:31:50.297 --> 01:31:52.956
It was always the plan, wasn't it?

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:58.371
Just smelling your hair.

01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:01.215
See if it still smelt
of that nit shampoo.

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:46.737
Hey, Matt.

01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:50.817
I'm busy.

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:52.576
I need to talk to you.

01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:01.502
Fuck off.

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:26.443
What a bastard night!

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:30.322
Lad, am I boring you again?
You've gone back to sleep?

01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:33.742
No, Daz. It's not you, lad.

01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:38.497
Hey.

01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:54.381
Faster! Step on it.

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:59.893
- Just fucking step on it!
- What the fuck's got into you, lad?

01:35:00.153 --> 01:35:02.187
Well, what you looking at there, mate?

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.140
You're bananas!

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.900
My own fucking terrorist bastard!

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:10.946
Selfish bastard!

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:15.033
Oh, I can't believe it!

01:35:19.506 --> 01:35:22.207
You're freaking me out, mate.
Come on, now, calm down.

01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:28.123
There he is!

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:29.291
Just drop me here.

01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:31.675
Bloody hell, what's Charlie gonna say?

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.427
I'm sorry, pal.

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:38.056
- There you go, lad.
- Sorry, Daz.

01:35:38.233 --> 01:35:39.843
Do you know what you're doing, lad?

01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:41.143
Yeah!

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:52.362
Bit risky in daylight.

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:56.575
Still a fucking terrorist, then?

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:04.284
Could have picked a less
slushy record, couldn't you?

01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:07.586
Thought the lyrics might tempt
you out of this shithole.

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:13.258
I was just getting used to it.

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:18.889
I got a new record,

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:22.517
if you wanna come check it out.

01:36:32.871 --> 01:36:34.780
Come on, then.

01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:37.942
What is it?

01:36:38.042 --> 01:36:39.486
You have to wait and see, won't you?

01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:41.203
Cheeky bastard.

01:36:41.963 --> 01:36:43.907
You trying to do cover-ups on me?

01:36:44.007 --> 01:36:45.832
I might be.

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:48.719
It's gotta be shit, then,
if you discovered it.
