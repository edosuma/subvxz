>> ANTONIO, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE

16:02.395 --> 16:04.998
YOU.

16:04.998 --> 16:05.999
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

16:05.999 --> 16:07.334
I TRIED CALLING SEVERAL TIMES,

16:07.334 --> 16:08.501
BUT I NEVER HEARD BACK.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.702
>> I ALMOST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO

16:09.702 --> 16:10.403
BEGIN.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.239
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS HAVE BEEN

16:12.239 --> 16:14.174
INCREDIBLE.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.076
I'VE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA--

16:16.076 --> 16:17.044
IN REHAB.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.546
>> OH, REALLY?

16:19.546 --> 16:21.014
THAT'S GREAT.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.015
HOW IS THAT WORKING?

16:22.015 --> 16:24.251
>> IT'S BEEN AMAZING,

16:24.251 --> 16:28.055
CHALLENGING, VERY CHALLENGING.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.657
IN FACT, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.225
I HAVE REACHED A VERY IMPORTANT

16:32.225 --> 16:34.027
STEP IN MY RECOVERY.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.263
I HAVE COME TO MAKE AMENDS FOR

16:36.263 --> 16:38.698
THE HURT I HAVE CAUSED.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.467
>> ANTONIO, THERE'S NO REASON

16:40.467 --> 16:41.168
TO--

16:41.168 --> 16:42.069
>> RAQUEL, PLEASE.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.070
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU

16:43.070 --> 16:44.037
ALLOW ME THE CHANCE TO SAY WHAT

16:44.037 --> 16:46.339
MUST BE SAID.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.176
I NEED THIS.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.117
>> IT MUST'VE BEEN SO HARD BEING

16:57.117 --> 16:58.085
CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD

16:58.085 --> 16:58.785
LIKE THAT.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.187
>> WELL, IT WAS.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.321
MANY TIMES I FELT I WOULDN'T

17:01.321 --> 17:02.455
HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CONTINUE

17:02.455 --> 17:03.590
THE PROGRAM.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.358
BUT IT HELPED ME SO MUCH.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.393
IT HELPED ME TO SEE WHAT WAS

17:06.393 --> 17:07.694
AT THE ROOT OF MY ADDICTION.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.162
>> AND WHAT WAS THAT?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.197
>> I DON'T KNOW, RAQUEL.

17:10.197 --> 17:13.266
YOU KNOW, IT'S--IT WASN'T EASY

17:13.266 --> 17:15.268
GROWING UP LATINO WITH SO FEW OF

17:15.268 --> 17:17.370
US HERE IN ATLANTA.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.107
YOU KNOW, THE ATTITUDES,

17:20.107 --> 17:21.708
THE NICKNAMES.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.211
>> KIDS CAN BE SO CRUEL.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.180
>> YEAH, AND SO CAN THE PARENTS.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.384
>> I'M STILL EMBARRASSED ABOUT

17:31.384 --> 17:33.186
THAT, ANTONIO.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.387
MY MOTHER, ESPECIALLY, SHE

17:34.387 --> 17:35.088
JUST--

17:35.088 --> 17:35.822
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.389
I DON'T BLAME THEM ANYMORE,

17:36.389 --> 17:38.158
RAQUEL.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.692
I DON'T.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.094
BUT IN MY REJECTION OF HOW THIS

17:41.094 --> 17:42.462
WORLD SAW ME, I THOUGHT I FOUND

17:42.462 --> 17:43.763
A POSITIVE EXPRESSION OF MY

17:43.763 --> 17:45.098
HERITAGE.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.666
BUT I HAD ONLY EMBRACED ANOTHER

17:46.666 --> 17:51.304
STEREOTYPE...THE LATIN LOVER.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.839
DON JUAN.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.274
>> AND THAT WAS THE START OF

17:54.274 --> 17:55.142
YOUR SEX ADDICTION?

17:55.142 --> 17:56.209
>> WELL, EXCEPT THAT I WASN'T

17:56.209 --> 17:58.145
REALLY A LOVER.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.746
I WAS MORE LIKE--LIKE

17:59.746 --> 18:01.181
A CONQUISTADOR, YOU KNOW, A

18:01.181 --> 18:03.283
HEARTBREAKER, MORE LIKE AN ASS.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.218
>> YOU WERE NEVER THAT.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.153
>> NO?

18:06.153 --> 18:07.320
YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME BACK, AS

18:07.320 --> 18:08.488
GLAD AS I WAS TO BE WITH YOU

18:08.488 --> 18:10.857
AGAIN, ANOTHER PART OF ME WANTED

18:10.857 --> 18:12.292
YOU TO HURT AS DEEPLY AS I DID

18:12.292 --> 18:14.161
WHEN YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.795
>> I WAS 17.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.264
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO STAND UP TO

18:17.264 --> 18:17.764
MY PARENTS.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.498
>> IT'S FINE, RAQUEL.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.266
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.601
BECAUSE WHEN I CONFESSED MY

18:21.601 --> 18:23.136
PROBLEMS, AND YOU STILL STOOD BY

18:23.136 --> 18:28.175
ME, THAT--THE SHAME I FELT, MY

18:28.175 --> 18:30.777
ANGER AT MYSELF, I KNEW RIGHT

18:30.777 --> 18:32.212
AWAY I HAD TO WORK HARDER TO

18:32.212 --> 18:33.646
CONQUER MY ADDICTION.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.215
>> ANTONIO, I CAN'T TAKE CREDIT

18:35.215 --> 18:36.183
FOR THAT.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.817
>> YES, YOU CAN.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.252
BELIEVE ME, I WOULDN'T BE

18:39.252 --> 18:40.320
THE MAN I AM TODAY, OFFERING MY

18:40.320 --> 18:42.489
APOLOGIES AND MAKING AMENDS, IF

18:42.489 --> 18:45.192
YOU HADN'T SHOWN ME COMPASSION.

18:45.192 --> 18:48.161
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.901
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.870
>> OF COURSE.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.776
>> YOU PLAY GUITAR NOW?

19:03.776 --> 19:04.711
>> HARDLY.

19:04.711 --> 19:09.216
I BOUGHT THAT FOR MY BOYFRIEND.

19:09.216 --> 19:09.949
>> OKAY.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.351
>> IT'S OKAY.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.619
CHARLES AND I BROKE UP BEFORE I

19:12.619 --> 19:14.287
COULD GIVE IT TO HIM.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.588
>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

19:15.588 --> 19:16.656
>> THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SAY,

19:16.656 --> 19:17.857
EXCEPT THAT THE BREAKUP WAS

19:17.857 --> 19:22.495
UNEXPECTED, BUT FOR THE BEST.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.297
>> WELL, I DO WISH WE CAN STAY

19:24.297 --> 19:25.498
IN TOUCH.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.733
>> I'D LIKE THAT.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.636
>> MAYBE WE CAN GET TOGETHER AND

19:29.636 --> 19:30.370
FINALLY WATCH

19:30.370 --> 19:32.272
THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.241
[laughter]

19:36.209 --> 19:37.344
IT'S GOOD SEEING YOU.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.313
>> GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.327
>> RAQUEL.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.307
[speaking Spanish]

20:07.307 --> 20:09.008
>> GRACIAS, PAPI.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.510
>> * A DEVIL COME UP TO ME

20:10.510 --> 20:12.379

20:30.297 --> 20:32.365
>> IS THAT A NEW SWEATER?

20:32.365 --> 20:33.966
>> I KNOW I TOTALLY CAN'T AFFORD

20:33.966 --> 20:35.268
IT, BUT RAQUEL WAS HAVING A

20:35.268 --> 20:37.404
SALE, 75% OFF.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.271
I FIGURED IF I TIGHTENED UP ON

20:38.271 --> 20:39.439
MY BUDGET THIS MONTH, I COULD

20:39.439 --> 20:40.307
TREAT MYSELF.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.874
>> REALLY, IT'S A TREAT FOR ME,

20:41.874 --> 20:42.909
BECAUSE I GET TO LOOK AT YOU IN

20:42.909 --> 20:43.910
IT.

20:43.910 --> 20:44.844
>> THANKS FOR BRINGING LUNCH

20:44.844 --> 20:45.478
HERE.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.279
>> NO WORRIES, "O".

20:46.279 --> 20:47.447
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TRY THAT

20:47.447 --> 20:49.982
NEW DELI AROUND THE CORNER.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.419
>> THIS IS, UH, SO EMBARRASSING.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.320
LOOK, I CAN'T PAY YOU BACK UNTIL

20:53.320 --> 20:54.421
PAYDAY.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.423
AFTER DEREK MOVED OUT, I HAD TO

20:56.423 --> 20:57.424
GET USED TO PAYING EVERYTHING BY

20:57.424 --> 20:58.458
MYSELF.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.427
AND LET'S JUST SAY PLAN "A"

21:00.427 --> 21:01.461
DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.695
>> WHICH WAS?

21:02.695 --> 21:03.996
>> MAXING OUT MY CREDIT CARDS.

21:03.996 --> 21:04.931
THAT'S WHY I'M ON SUCH A STRICT

21:04.931 --> 21:05.765
BUDGET NOW.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.933
WHEN YOU SAID SANDWICH, I

21:06.933 --> 21:08.301
THOUGHT YOU MEANT SUBWAY, LIKE

21:08.301 --> 21:09.702
$5 FOOT LONG, A BAG OF CHIPS

21:09.702 --> 21:12.472
AND A DRINK, MAYBE A COOKIE.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.940
JUST THE MAYONNAISE IN THAT

21:13.940 --> 21:16.376
PLACE WOULD BREAK THE BANK.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.945
THIS WAS 75% OFF.

21:18.945 --> 21:19.979
>> IT'S COOL.

21:19.979 --> 21:20.947
LUNCH IS ON ME.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.482
AND DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.683
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN YOUR

21:23.683 --> 21:24.717
SITUATION.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.052

21:26.052 --> 21:27.420
NOT ONLY ARE YOU SWEET AND

21:27.420 --> 21:29.389
GENEROUS, BUT UNDERSTANDING TOO.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.022

21:30.022 --> 21:31.458
$15 SANDWICH.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.459
COULD YOU AT LEAST ADD

21:32.459 --> 21:33.493
"INCREDIBLY SEXY" TO YOUR LIST?

21:33.493 --> 21:35.428
>> THAT WAS ALREADY AT THE TOP.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.331
>> [chuckles]

21:50.076 --> 21:52.044
>> [indistinct whispering]

21:57.950 --> 21:58.918

22:02.489 --> 22:03.356
BUT I'M RIPPING IT UP.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.792
>> OOH, SEE WHAT'S INSIDE FIRST.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.528
IF IT'S WACK, THEN RIP IT UP.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.930

24:14.120 --> 24:15.655
>> OR STAY IN BED AND HAVE THEM

24:15.655 --> 24:17.256
SOME MORE.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.257
I HAVE MISSED SEVERAL

24:18.257 --> 24:19.759
APPOINTMENTS TO FINISH MY DREAMS

24:19.759 --> 24:21.060
ABOUT BRAD PITT, OKAY?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.895
[laughter]

24:22.895 --> 24:23.930
>> I GUESS THE GOOD THING IS,

24:23.930 --> 24:25.598
YOU'RE DISTRACTED FROM CHARLES.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.098
>> RIGHT.

24:26.098 --> 24:26.699
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE STILL THAT

24:26.699 --> 24:28.034
HUNG UP ON HIM, YOU COULDN'T BE

24:28.034 --> 24:29.602
DISTRACTED.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.904
YOU WOULD MISS HIM.

24:31.904 --> 24:35.207
LIKE, A LOT.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.543
>> YEAH.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.945
YOU'D THINK ABOUT HIM...

24:38.945 --> 24:41.848
ALL THE TIME.

24:41.848 --> 24:42.815
>> AND WISH YOU'D DONE THINGS

24:42.815 --> 24:44.651
DIFFERENTLY.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.818
>> BUT NONE OF THAT APPLIES

24:45.818 --> 24:47.119
HERE, RIGHT?

24:47.119 --> 24:47.820
>> NO.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.989
NO, NO, NO. NOT TO ME.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.225
>> MAYBE TO ME A LITTLE BIT.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.262
I REALLY MISS REGGIE.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.066
>> APRIL, WE WON'T THINK ANY

25:00.066 --> 25:00.900
LESS OF YOU IF YOU TAKE HIM

25:00.900 --> 25:01.834
BACK.

25:01.834 --> 25:02.902
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

25:02.902 --> 25:03.970
PRIDE DOESN'T KISS AND CUDDLE UP

25:03.970 --> 25:04.971
WITH YOU AT NIGHT.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.873
SO DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.140
BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP SAYING

25:08.140 --> 25:10.009
NO A LITTLE LONGER, WE WON'T

25:10.009 --> 25:10.843
MIND.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.044
BECAUSE HIM TRYING TO GET YOU

25:12.044 --> 25:14.947
BACK IS A WONDERFUL THING.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.717
>> [laughs]

25:30.563 --> 25:32.565
>> [sighs]

25:47.179 --> 25:48.915
>> UH, KEISHA?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.049
>> ASHLEE.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.884
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:51.884 --> 25:54.120
>> I'M HAVING A STEAM, LIKE YOU.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.121
>> I THOUGHT YOU MOVED TO

25:55.121 --> 25:57.924
THE IVORY COAST, PERMANENTLY.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.091
>> NOTHING'S PERMANENT, KEISHA.

25:59.091 --> 25:59.992
BY NOW, EVEN YOU SHOULD KNOW

25:59.992 --> 26:01.060
THAT.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.995
BUT SINCE CERTAIN SITUATIONS

26:02.995 --> 26:04.697
COOLED DOWN, I THOUGHT IT SAFE

26:04.697 --> 26:06.933
TO COME BACK AND HANDLE SOME

26:06.933 --> 26:08.367
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.268
>> OKAY.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.003
WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.172
>> SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOU AND

26:13.172 --> 26:14.006
MALCOLM.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.775
SUCH A SHAME.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.009
>> YOU CAN SPARE ME THE FAKE

26:17.009 --> 26:18.044
SYMPATHY, ASHLEE.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.211
WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T

26:19.211 --> 26:20.913
WANT ME AND MALCOLM TO WORK OUT.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.281
>> TRUE.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.183
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HIS DESIRE FOR

26:24.183 --> 26:26.252
A GREAT MERGER RATHER THAN

26:26.252 --> 26:27.787
A GREAT LOVE LIFE ULTIMATELY WON

26:27.787 --> 26:28.788
OUT AGAIN.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.122
AND THAT IS A SHAME.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.824
PLUS, TAYLOR?

26:31.824 --> 26:33.159
I MEAN, LET'S JUST SAY IT.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.061
SHE'S NOT ME.

26:35.061 --> 26:38.965
OR EVEN YOU, FOR THAT MATTER.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.033
>> WHO MALCOLM LOVES AND WHAT HE

26:41.033 --> 26:42.969
DOES WITH HIS LIFE IS NO LONGER

26:42.969 --> 26:44.704
MY CONCERN.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.873
NOR YOURS, LAST I CHECKED.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.741
>> RIGHT, LIKE I AM THE ONLY ONE

26:48.741 --> 26:50.276
STILL HOLDING ONTO HIM.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.310
I SEE YOU'RE STILL DRIVING THAT

26:51.310 --> 26:52.912
ASTON MARTIN HE BOUGHT YOU.

26:52.912 --> 26:53.746
>> IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CAR.

26:53.746 --> 26:54.914
WHY WOULDN'T I CONTINUE TO DRIVE

26:54.914 --> 26:55.648
IT?

26:55.648 --> 26:56.949
>> [chuckles] RIGHT.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.384
[sighs] THAT'S WHAT I SAY AS I

26:58.384 --> 26:59.819
STILL WEAR ALL THE JEWELRY HE

26:59.819 --> 27:02.321
GAVE ME.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.323
ANYWAY, TIME FOR MY MASSAGE.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.093
BUT LET'S GET LUNCH SOON AND,

27:07.093 --> 27:09.028
UH, HAVE A REAL CHAT.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.162
I'LL CALL YOU.

27:10.162 --> 27:13.132
>> YOU DON'T HAVE MY NUMBER.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.103
>> SO, THAT WAS MALCOLM'S

27:17.103 --> 27:18.270
EX-WIFE ASHLEE?

27:18.270 --> 27:19.105
>> THAT WAS WEIRD.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.673
WHAT'S HER DEAL?

27:20.673 --> 27:22.709
>> ALL I KNOW IS, THE LAST TIME

27:22.709 --> 27:24.276
SHE WAS THAT FRIENDLY, SHE WAS

27:24.276 --> 27:26.012
UP TO NO GOOD.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.213
HELL, SHE CAN EVEN BE THE ONE

27:27.213 --> 27:28.347
BEHIND ALL THE STRANGE THINGS

27:28.347 --> 27:29.882
THAT KEEP HAPPENING TO ME.

27:29.882 --> 27:30.950
[all shout]

27:30.950 --> 27:32.151
>> DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.453
JUST FORGOT MY WATER.

27:34.453 --> 27:38.157
SEE YOU AROUND.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.125
>> SHE JUST ALMOST GAVE ME

27:39.125 --> 27:39.859
A HEART ATTACK.

27:39.859 --> 27:40.359
>> YEAH.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.193
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S YOUR

27:41.193 --> 27:42.228
STALKER OR NOT, BUT YOU NEED TO

27:42.228 --> 27:44.096
KEEP AN EYE ON THAT BITCH.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.131
SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.099
>> MM.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.744
>> [chuckles]

27:57.744 --> 27:58.277
>> WHAT?

27:58.277 --> 27:59.178
>> NOTHING.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.112
>> WHAT?

28:00.112 --> 28:03.015
>> YOU JUST EAT REALLY CUTE.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.285
[laughter]

28:06.285 --> 28:07.987
>> UH, THANKS FOR FINALLY

28:07.987 --> 28:09.288
AGREEING TO COME OUT WITH ME.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.256
>> WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,

28:10.256 --> 28:12.058
THE SPA WAS AWESOME.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.893
YOU'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING.

28:13.893 --> 28:14.894
>> DOES THAT MEAN YOU FINALLY

28:14.894 --> 28:15.762
FORGIVE ME?

28:15.762 --> 28:18.497
>> YES, I FORGIVE YOU.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.799
>> THANK YOU.

>> I'M SORRY.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.508
DID I MISUNDERSTAND?

28:29.508 --> 28:30.442
>> IF YOU WERE STAYING IN

28:30.442 --> 28:31.844
ATLANTA, THEN WE COULD POSSIBLY

28:31.844 --> 28:32.812
REBUILD TO THAT.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.014
BUT YOU'RE MOVING, SO I DON'T

28:35.014 --> 28:35.614
WANT TO SET US UP FOR ANOTHER

28:35.614 --> 28:36.415
BREAKUP.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.416
>> WELL, IF YOU MOVE WITH ME,

28:37.416 --> 28:38.517
THERE WON'T BE A BREAKUP.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.451
>> AND HOW CAN I BE SURE OF

28:39.451 --> 28:40.853
THAT, REGGIE?

28:40.853 --> 28:43.489
WHAT IF I UPROOT MYSELF FOR YOU

28:43.489 --> 28:45.257
AND YOU BACK AWAY AGAIN?

28:45.257 --> 28:46.258
WHERE WOULD THAT LEAVE ME?

28:46.258 --> 28:48.227
>> THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

HEY, I WOULD NEVER EVER DO THAT

28:50.429 --> 28:51.363

28:52.999 --> 28:54.200
THINK YOU'D DO IT THE FIRST TIME

28:54.200 --> 28:56.135
EITHER.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.204
[sighs] LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.239
I JUST CAN'T CHANCE IT.

YOU ARE FORGIVEN, BUT I STILL

29:05.211 --> 29:08.247
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR ME.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.328
YOU KNOW, HE DID SHOW ME HIS

31:36.328 --> 31:37.229
BUDGET.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.430
>> FINALLY, SOME TRUTH UP IN

31:38.430 --> 31:39.165
THIS MUG.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.000
>> BUT WHY WAS IT PRINTED ON

31:41.000 --> 31:42.334
A HAND-WOVEN, ACID-FREE,

31:42.334 --> 31:44.170
GOLD-TRIMMED PAPER?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.172
TALKING ABOUT, "IT WAS 25% OFF.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.406
IT WAS A STEAL, BABE."

31:47.406 --> 31:48.407
I'M LIKE, "WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE

31:48.407 --> 31:49.341
JUST STOLE IT."

31:49.341 --> 31:53.279
[laughter and applause]

31:53.279 --> 31:55.347
>> YOU WERE RIGHT, OMAR.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.949
HE IS HILARIOUS!

31:56.949 --> 31:58.917
[laughs]

32:04.991 --> 32:06.025
>> OH, THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING

32:06.025 --> 32:06.558
OUT HERE.

32:06.558 --> 32:10.362
>> IT WAS A PLEASURE.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.430
>> HEY, LET ME INTRODUCE--

32:11.430 --> 32:15.434
>> EXCUSE US.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.402
>> WHAT'S UP?

32:16.402 --> 32:17.136
DON'T YOU WANT TO MEET--

32:17.136 --> 32:18.204
>> I DON'T WANT TO MEET THEM.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.438
HOW COULD YOU TALK ABOUT ME LIKE

32:19.438 --> 32:19.972
THAT IN FRONT OF ALL THESE

32:19.972 --> 32:21.440
IMPORTANT PEOPLE?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.209
I WAS SO EMBARRASSED.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.310
>> BUT THEY DON'T KNOW YOU.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.477
>> MY FRIENDS KNOW ME.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.245
>> AND THEY WERE LAUGHING

32:26.245 --> 32:26.745
THE HARDEST.

32:26.745 --> 32:27.679
COME ON, BABE, IT'S JUST JOKES.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.481
>> MAYBE TO YOU, BUT NOT TO ME.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.416
>> LOOK, I'M SORRY IF IT BOTHERS

32:30.416 --> 32:31.350
YOU, BUT DID I SAY THAT WASN'T

32:31.350 --> 32:32.051
TRUE?

32:32.051 --> 32:32.551
>> THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.452
THE POINT IS THIS STUFF IS

32:33.452 --> 32:34.386
PRIVATE.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.155
>> OMAR, I'M A COMEDIAN.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.389
I CAN'T CENSOR MYSELF.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.258
IT'S NOT HONEST IF I DO THAT.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.392
ANYBODY WHO DATES ME IS GOING TO

32:40.392 --> 32:41.627
HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.695
>> WELL, I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.665
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR SECOND SET.

I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE, "DAMN,

33:43.522 --> 33:44.756
KEISHA, YOU'RE MAKING US LATE."

33:44.756 --> 33:45.524
>> [chuckles]

33:45.524 --> 33:46.458
>> DID YOU LIE ABOUT THE FLIGHT

33:46.458 --> 33:47.326

33:47.326 --> 33:48.260
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.095
>> SO, WE REALLY ARE RUNNING

>> UH-HUH.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.465
>> OH, WELL, WHY ARE YOU NOT

33:53.465 --> 33:54.733
FREAKING OUT AS USUAL AND

33:54.733 --> 33:55.501
RUSHING ME?

33:55.501 --> 33:56.835
>> BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS

33:56.835 --> 33:58.670
ANOTHER PLANE, AND YOU'RE ALWAYS

33:58.670 --> 34:00.572
WORTH THE WAIT.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.397
OH, HELLO.

34:25.397 --> 34:30.302
>> KEISHA, I NEED YOUR HELP.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.537
>> WHY?

34:31.537 --> 34:32.538
WHAT'S WRONG?

34:32.538 --> 34:33.772
>> I WAS ARRESTED FOR A DUI AND

34:33.772 --> 34:35.607
YOU'RE MY ONLY CALL.

34:35.607 --> 34:36.708
I REALLY NEED YOU TO COME GET

34:36.708 --> 34:39.678
ME.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.627
>> UM, UH--

34:55.627 --> 34:58.830
TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.233
MM-HMM.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.834
I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.370
BYE.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.404
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

35:05.404 --> 35:07.539
WHO WAS THAT?

35:07.539 --> 35:10.509
>> IT WAS MALCOLM.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.478
HE'S IN JAIL FOR A DUI, AND HE

35:12.478 --> 35:14.313
NEEDS ME TO GO BAIL HIM OUT.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.281
>> OH, UH-HUH.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.482
HE'S GOT A GANG OF LAWYERS, AND

35:16.482 --> 35:17.416
HIS OWN GIRLFRIEND FOR THAT

35:17.416 --> 35:18.284
MATTER.

35:18.284 --> 35:19.418
LET THEM BAIL HIM OUT.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.920
AND WE GOT A FLIGHT TO CATCH.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.390
>> BUT HE ONLY GETS ONE CALL AND

35:24.390 --> 35:25.391
HE CALLED ME.

IF I GET ON A PLANE, WHO KNOWS

35:26.492 --> 35:27.726
HOW LONG HE'LL BE STUCK IN

35:27.726 --> 35:28.827
THERE?

35:28.827 --> 35:29.461
>> SO, YOU'RE GOING TO JUST BLOW

35:29.461 --> 35:30.596
OFF THIS TRIP?

35:30.596 --> 35:32.164
>> I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT COMING

35:32.164 --> 35:32.698
TO MIAMI.

35:32.698 --> 35:33.532
I'M JUST SAYING I'LL TAKE A

35:33.532 --> 35:36.302
LATER FLIGHT.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.404
SEAN, I'D DO THE SAME FOR ANY

35:38.404 --> 35:39.838
FRIEND WHO CALLED ME FROM JAIL.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.240
AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD TOO.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.174
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING

35:42.174 --> 35:43.575
THIS.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.378
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:46.378 --> 35:48.580
DON'T EVEN BOTHER COMING.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.582
I'M GONE.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.418
>> SEAN.

35:52.418 --> 35:55.387
SEAN.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.429
>> HEY.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.596
THANKS FOR COMING OVER SO

36:04.596 --> 36:05.231
QUICKLY.

36:05.231 --> 36:05.764
>> OH, SURE.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.433
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:07.433 --> 36:09.568
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

36:09.568 --> 36:10.736
EVERYTHING.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.939
AND I HAVE ONE QUESTION TO ASK

36:13.939 --> 36:15.407
YOU.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.742
>> UH, LET'S HEAR IT.

36:16.742 --> 36:17.743
>> YOU HAD NO CLUE HOW I'D

36:17.743 --> 36:19.778
RESPOND TO THAT TATTOO.

36:19.778 --> 36:22.481
SO WHAT MADE YOU GET IT?

36:22.481 --> 36:24.450
>> WHEN I GOT THE IDEA TO DO IT,

36:24.450 --> 36:26.852
I JUST ASKED MYSELF, "WAS IT

36:26.852 --> 36:28.254
TRUE OR NOT?"

36:28.254 --> 36:29.588
>> IF WHAT WAS TRUE?

36:29.588 --> 36:31.490
>> IF I LOVED YOU.

36:31.490 --> 36:35.261
IT'S ALL THAT MATTERED.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.763
>> REGGIE, I LOVE YOU TOO, AND

36:37.763 --> 36:40.466
I'LL MOVE TO NEW YORK WITH YOU.

36:40.466 --> 36:41.633
>> OH, WHAT? [laughs]

36:41.633 --> 36:43.402
COME HERE.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.936
[laughter]

36:48.640 --> 36:52.411
>> THANK YOU.

36:52.411 --> 36:52.978
HEY.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.846
>> SO, WHAT'S UP?

36:54.846 --> 36:57.616
I KNOW I JOKE AROUND A LOT, BUT

36:57.616 --> 36:58.484
I SERIOUSLY HOPE YOU'RE NOT

36:58.484 --> 36:59.451
ENDING THIS.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.319
>> YOU REALLY THREW ME THE OTHER

37:00.319 --> 37:01.653
NIGHT.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.289
BUT I'VE HAD A MINUTE TO ADJUST

37:03.289 --> 37:04.990
AND THINK ABOUT IT.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.659
AND I DO RESPECT YOU NEED

37:07.659 --> 37:08.694
FREEDOM AS AN ARTIST.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.662
SO, I'M NOT READY TO GIVE UP ON

37:10.662 --> 37:11.863
US JUST YET.

37:11.863 --> 37:12.931
>> THANK YOU.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.366
YOU HAD ME WORRIED.

37:14.366 --> 37:15.434
>> JUST DON'T EVER SLIP AND SAY

37:15.434 --> 37:16.268
MY NAME IN YOUR ACT.

37:16.268 --> 37:16.868
DEAL?

37:16.868 --> 37:17.669
>> DEAL.

37:17.669 --> 37:18.537
I WON'T MESS WITH MY LUCKY

37:18.537 --> 37:19.438
CHARM.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.606
NOT ONLY DID I GET THREE NEW

37:20.606 --> 37:21.673
BOOKINGS FROM THAT SHOWCASE,

37:21.673 --> 37:23.609
I ALSO GOT AN AGENT.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.843
EVERYBODY LOVES MY BROKE

37:24.843 --> 37:26.044
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.279
>> CAN YOU STOP SAYING "BROKE"?

37:27.279 --> 37:28.547
CAN YOU STOP SAYING "BROKE"?

37:28.547 --> 37:30.616
IT'S MORE LIKE, TEMPORARILY

37:30.616 --> 37:31.683
FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED.

37:31.683 --> 37:32.584
>> I KNOW.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.552
IT'S--IT'S A REAL PROBLEM.

37:33.552 --> 37:34.453
THEY SHOULD MAKE PARKING

37:34.453 --> 37:35.053
PLACARDS FOR IT.

37:35.053 --> 37:35.987
SOR--SORRY.

37:35.987 --> 37:36.955
HABIT.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.024
I'M A COMEDIAN.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.527
BUT TRUTHFULLY, YOU'RE THE

37:41.527 --> 37:44.530
SWEETEST GUY I'VE EVER DATED.

37:44.530 --> 37:45.697
>> WHY DON'T YOU WORK THAT INTO

37:45.697 --> 37:47.333
YOUR ACT?

37:47.333 --> 37:50.669
THEN YOU CAN USE MY NAME.

37:50.669 --> 37:51.670
>> IT WAS KINDA FUNNY THOUGH,

37:51.670 --> 37:52.371
RIGHT?

37:52.371 --> 37:55.341
>> IT WAS KINDA FUNNY.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.645
>> THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME

37:59.645 --> 38:00.579
RIDING, ANTONIO.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.647
>> OH, MY PLEASURE.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.749
>> BUT NEXT TIME I CAN JUST MEET

38:03.749 --> 38:04.550
YOU AT THE STABLES.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.617
THIS IS KIND OF OUT OF THE WAY

38:05.617 --> 38:06.352
FOR YOU.

38:06.352 --> 38:06.852
>> I KNOW.

38:06.852 --> 38:07.486
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU LIKE IT

38:07.486 --> 38:09.721
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE DRIVES.

38:09.721 --> 38:12.558
>> FOREVER THE GENTLEMAN.

38:12.558 --> 38:13.692
CHARLES WAS ALWAYS LIKE THAT

38:13.692 --> 38:16.562
TOO.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.597
>> GOOD TO KNOW.

38:18.597 --> 38:21.467
[chuckles]

38:21.467 --> 38:24.436
I'LL CALL YOU.

38:34.613 --> 38:35.947
>> MAYBE NEXT TIME WE SHOULD GO

38:35.947 --> 38:37.749
ON A REAL DATE.

38:37.749 --> 38:38.617
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD

38:38.617 --> 38:39.518
IDEA, RAQUEL.

38:39.518 --> 38:40.352
>> WHY?

38:40.352 --> 38:41.387
YOU YOURSELF SAID THAT YOU ARE

38:41.387 --> 38:42.421
READY TO GET BACK OUT THERE.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.355
>> YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

38:43.355 --> 38:45.090
BUT I JUST CAME OFF MONTHS OF

38:45.090 --> 38:47.893
INTENSE THERAPY AND CELIBACY.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.695
BESIDES, I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

38:49.695 --> 38:53.665
WHO I GET INVOLVED WITH.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.033
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:55.033 --> 38:56.568
>> THERE WILL BE A TIME FOR US,

38:56.568 --> 38:58.637
I KNOW THAT, BUT NOT NOW.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.905
BESIDES, YOU JUST ENDED

38:59.905 --> 39:01.373
A RELATIONSHIP NO LESS THAN TWO

39:01.373 --> 39:02.741
WEEKS AGO.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.743
>> ANTONIO, THIS IS US.

39:04.743 --> 39:05.911
TIME SHOULDN'T MATTER.

39:05.911 --> 39:06.812
>> YOU KNOW, RAQUEL, I THINK

39:06.812 --> 39:08.514
YOU'RE IN DENIAL ABOUT YOUR

39:08.514 --> 39:09.848
FEELINGS FOR CHARLES AND YOU ARE

39:09.848 --> 39:10.916
TRANSFERRING THEM ONTO ME.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.985
>> I DON'T THINK I'M DOING THAT.

39:13.985 --> 39:14.786
AM I?

39:14.786 --> 39:15.887
>> FOR STARTERS, EVERY TIME WE

39:15.887 --> 39:16.822
ARE TOGETHER, YOU ALWAYS BRING

39:16.822 --> 39:17.723
HIM UP.

39:17.723 --> 39:18.424
>> NO, I DON'T.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.425
>> YOU JUST DID A FEW SECONDS

39:19.425 --> 39:19.958
AGO.

39:19.958 --> 39:20.559
>> LOOK, CHARLES, I SAID I WAS

39:20.559 --> 39:23.929
OVER HIM--

39:23.929 --> 39:26.632
[sighs]

39:26.632 --> 39:27.466
I'M SORRY.

39:27.466 --> 39:27.999
I DIDN'T MEAN--

39:27.999 --> 39:29.735
>> I WISH YOU WERE OVER HIM SO

39:29.735 --> 39:31.437
BAD, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

39:31.437 --> 39:33.605
AND I WILL RESPECT THAT.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.107
BUT ONLY FOR SO LONG.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.776
'CAUSE THE FIRST TIME I SEE THAT

39:37.776 --> 39:40.446
YOU ARE TRULY READY FOR THIS,
