this out, Mr. Rose,

a rush to see this place,

09:41.189 --> 09:42.973
we wouldn't be at a funeral.

up to Roland.

where we can leave

to do is offend the woman

we're actually buying it.

of a motel

at the owner's funeral.

Johnny here um...

10:56.699 --> 10:59.180

10:59.223 --> 11:01.530

11:01.573 --> 11:03.837

than Benny's bonspiel, so we...

is more than just
the new motel.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.504
- Oh. Well...

17:51.679 --> 17:53.159
what is it, Stevie?

17:54.943 --> 17:58.294
- I don't think I'm ready to...

17:58.338 --> 18:01.993
commit to this business like,

18:03.604 --> 18:05.606
as a whole.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.303
- Oh.

18:07.347 --> 18:10.654
Well, that is a bigger
conversation, isn't it?

18:10.698 --> 18:13.309
- It's just, doing
"Cabaret" made me feel

18:13.353 --> 18:15.311
like I should push myself,

18:15.355 --> 18:17.835
and so I just wondered...

18:17.879 --> 18:20.186
you know, maybe there's
something more

18:20.229 --> 18:21.883
out there for me.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.626
- Well, what are you saying,
you want out?

18:25.669 --> 18:28.933
- No! Uh, I don't know,
I just...

18:30.805 --> 18:33.503
I feel like I'd regret it

18:33.547 --> 18:35.940
if I didn't at least try
to see what's out there.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.074
- Well, if that's what you feel

18:39.118 --> 18:41.685
you need to push yourself,
Stevie, I uh...

18:41.729 --> 18:44.645
certainly am not gonna stand
in your way.

18:45.689 --> 18:46.864
Same reason I left the button
factory

18:46.908 --> 18:49.171
when I was a young man.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.217
That, and the fact that
working conditions

18:51.260 --> 18:54.133
weren't exactly safe
for a ten-year-old, but...

18:54.176 --> 18:56.526
that being said,
I'm not going to pretend

18:56.570 --> 18:59.050
that I don't hope
you'll come back.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.359
Either way, I hope you find
what you're looking for.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.232
- Mr. Rose... thank you.

19:08.886 --> 19:11.367
Okay, you know what?
I think...

19:11.411 --> 19:13.761
I should just head home early,

19:13.804 --> 19:16.590
and think about it.
- Yeah...

19:17.721 --> 19:21.377
or you can think about it
as you finish your shift?

19:21.421 --> 19:23.118
- That's fair.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.382
- I'm gonna miss
that enthusiasm.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.819
- [Groans]

19:32.127 --> 19:33.607
[Crickets chirp]

19:33.650 --> 19:35.957
[Door opens, light clicks off]

19:37.132 --> 19:39.221
- I'm so glad you decided
to stay.

19:39.265 --> 19:42.746
- Well, there's literally
no liquid left in my body, so.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.574
- [Small laugh]

19:44.618 --> 19:46.446
- Oh! [Mattress crinkles]
- Yeah...

19:46.489 --> 19:47.925
- Forgot about this.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.231
- Taking that off first
thing tomorrow.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.233
- Huh!

19:51.277 --> 19:52.974
[Happy exhale]

19:53.017 --> 19:55.803
I wonder how long my mom
lasted on the internets.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.936
- Not long, I don't think.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.764
You know, you were smart
to get off of there.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.114
- Mhmm. I was curious to see
what kinds of things

20:03.158 --> 20:05.421
she was posting throughout
the day, though.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.249
- Yeah, nothing of note.
- Hmm.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.425
- Um yeah, she really didn't
know how to use it, so.

20:09.469 --> 20:10.948
- Mhmm.
- Hey,

20:10.992 --> 20:12.428
let's talk about something
else.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.256
- Sure, um...

20:14.300 --> 20:16.954
what's the thread count
on this plastic?

20:18.173 --> 20:21.263
- Okay, would it help
if I were to share

20:21.307 --> 20:24.179
something private and
embarrassing with you?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.616
- I might be too tired
for that tonight.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.009
- Ha ha!

20:29.967 --> 20:31.795
If we're gonna be married,
I just think it's important

20:31.839 --> 20:34.494
that we be as open and honest
with each other

20:34.537 --> 20:36.322
as we possibly can.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.151
- What is this sexy thing?

20:40.195 --> 20:42.850
- Okay, I only put this in
when you're not around.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.332
It's my mouthguard.
- Oh...

20:46.375 --> 20:48.856
well, there's nothing really
embarrassing about that.

20:48.899 --> 20:51.467
Also, you look very beautiful.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.164
- Aw, thank you.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.515
Um, hmm.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.038
How about...

20:57.952 --> 20:59.432
now?
- My God!

21:00.607 --> 21:02.261
- This is my nose thing,

21:02.304 --> 21:04.263
and it just helps me breathe
better.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.789
- I have never been more
attracted to you.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.138
- Mm, same.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.141
[David laughs]
[Cell phone chimes]

21:13.184 --> 21:14.273
- Ooh!

21:19.365 --> 21:21.410
Ronnie's texting me
a link to something?

21:21.454 --> 21:24.065
- Okay, put it away, David.
It's bedtime.
