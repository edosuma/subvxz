00:17.071 --> 00:19.339
- Aah!

00:25.513 --> 00:27.814
- Whoa!
- Aah!

01:19.800 --> 01:21.067
- I had that.

01:21.135 --> 01:22.736
- I didn't want to take
the chance.

01:22.803 --> 01:24.938
As it is, your landing could have
destabilized the entire bridge.

01:25.006 --> 01:26.473
- It didn't.

01:26.541 --> 01:30.043
- But it could have. We don't yet
know the limits of your powers.

01:30.111 --> 01:34.881
- But maybe you could, you know,
help me figure that out.

01:36.217 --> 01:37.884
- Batman's got that covered.

01:37.952 --> 01:39.319
I know, but--

01:39.387 --> 01:42.322
- Superman. Wait, Arrow.
Slow down. What's attacking?

01:42.390 --> 01:46.560
No, I'm definitely available.
Coordinates?

01:46.627 --> 01:49.262
Acknowledged. On my way.

01:49.330 --> 01:51.097
sorry, Super...Boy.

01:51.165 --> 01:52.899
Duty calls.

01:57.505 --> 01:58.505
Already got the alert, Bruce.

01:58.573 --> 02:02.776
- I know, Clark, but we need
to talk.

Young Justice - Season 1, Episode 5
"Schooled"

02:37.845 --> 02:42.649
- Recognized. Superboy,
Speed--0.4.

02:44.652 --> 02:47.754
- Hi, Superboy.
How was Metropolis?

02:49.490 --> 02:51.524
- Ready for training, everyone?

02:51.592 --> 02:54.327
- Black Canary! Uncle J'onn!

02:57.031 --> 03:00.300
- M'gann, I was
in the neighborhood,

03:00.368 --> 03:02.936
So I thought I'd see
how you were adjusting.

03:03.004 --> 03:05.805
- A few bumps, but I'm learning.

03:05.873 --> 03:07.807
- That's all I can ask.

03:07.875 --> 03:11.911
- Stick around.
Class is in session.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.519
I consider it an honor to be
your teacher.

03:19.587 --> 03:21.287
I'll throw a lot at you--

03:21.355 --> 03:23.657
Everything I've learned
from my own mentors--uh!--

03:23.724 --> 03:25.425
And my own bruises.

03:25.493 --> 03:26.693
- What happened?

03:26.761 --> 03:31.865
- The job. Now, combat is about
controlling conflict,

03:31.932 --> 03:33.600
Putting the battle
on your terms.

03:33.668 --> 03:36.569
You should always be acting,
never reacting.

03:36.637 --> 03:38.738
I'll need a sparring partner.

03:38.806 --> 03:40.840
- Right here. Yeah!

03:42.443 --> 03:43.743
After this--

03:43.811 --> 03:45.478
Swish--

03:45.546 --> 03:47.347
I'll show you my moves.

03:49.984 --> 03:51.351
Aah! Uh!

03:52.787 --> 03:55.588
Ohh. Hurts so good.

03:55.656 --> 03:58.224
- Good block. But did anyone see
what he did wrong?

03:58.292 --> 04:00.627
- Ooh, ooh. He hit on teacher
and got served?

04:00.695 --> 04:01.761
- Dude!

04:01.829 --> 04:04.397
- He allowed me to dictate
the terms of--

04:04.465 --> 04:09.903
- Oh, please. With my powers,
the battle's always on my terms.

04:09.970 --> 04:13.073
I'm a living weapon, and this is
a waste of my time.

04:13.140 --> 04:14.908
- Prove it.

04:27.655 --> 04:28.655
- Ha ha ha!

04:28.723 --> 04:30.323
Ha ha ha ha.

04:32.793 --> 04:37.030
- You're angry. Good, but don't
react. Channel that anger into--

04:42.169 --> 04:44.671
- That's it. I'm done.

04:44.739 --> 04:47.207
- Training is mandatory.

04:48.509 --> 04:50.343
- Batman to the cave.

04:50.411 --> 04:54.347
Five hours ago, a new menace
attacked Green Arrow and Black Canary.

04:54.415 --> 04:57.617
The attacker was capable of
studying, then duplicating

04:57.685 --> 04:59.786
The powers and abilities of
its opponents.

04:59.854 --> 05:03.389
Arrow called in reinforcements,
which nearly proved disastrous

05:03.457 --> 05:07.026
As our foe gained more and more
power with each new combatant.

05:07.094 --> 05:11.431
- Whoa. One guy with the powers
of the entire League?

05:11.499 --> 05:14.934
- In the end, it took 8 leaguers
4 hours to defeat

05:15.002 --> 05:16.603
And dismantle the android.

05:16.670 --> 05:19.706
- An android? Who made it,
T.O. Morrow?

05:19.774 --> 05:23.343
- Good guess, Robin. But
Red Tornado doesn't think so.

05:23.410 --> 05:27.881
- The technology bears
the signature of professor Ivo.

05:27.948 --> 05:30.450
- Ivo? But Ivo's dead.

05:30.518 --> 05:31.951
- So we all thought...

05:32.019 --> 05:33.386
Or hoped.

05:33.454 --> 05:35.955
- To make certain this threat
is permanently neutralized,

05:36.023 --> 05:38.992
We're sending two trucks
carrying the android's parts

05:39.059 --> 05:40.693
To two separate S.T.A.R. lab
facilities in Boston

05:40.761 --> 05:43.663
And New York for immediate
evaluation.

05:43.731 --> 05:45.465
Every precaution is being taken.

05:45.533 --> 05:48.668
We'll have 4 additional decoy
trucks to create confusion

05:48.736 --> 05:52.472
In case Ivo or anyone tries
to recover the remains.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.607
You will split
into undercover teams

05:54.675 --> 05:56.943
To safeguard
the two real trucks.

05:57.011 --> 05:58.511
- Yes! Road trip.

05:58.579 --> 06:00.680
- So now we take out
your trash.

06:00.748 --> 06:02.582
- You had something
better to do?

06:04.985 --> 06:07.654
- Coordinates received.
On our way.

06:09.056 --> 06:11.891
- When you're ready,
I'll be here.

06:42.857 --> 06:44.657
- S.T.A.R. Boston is a go.

06:44.725 --> 06:46.526
- S.T.A.R. Manhattan is go.

07:01.742 --> 07:05.445
- I told you, we need to talk.

07:25.299 --> 07:27.634
- If dislike is
the opposite of like,

07:27.701 --> 07:30.570
Is disaster the opposite
of aster?

07:30.638 --> 07:33.306
See, instead of things going
wrong, they go right.

07:34.675 --> 07:38.311
Uh, clearly you're not
feeling the aster. What's wrong?

07:38.379 --> 07:41.581
- Canary. And what business does
she have teaching combat skills

07:41.649 --> 07:43.449
To a guy with super strength?

07:43.517 --> 07:46.085
- Taking down stronger guys
is part of the gig.

07:46.153 --> 07:47.787
Canary learned
that the hard way.

07:47.855 --> 07:50.590
Same with Batman and, well, me.

07:54.194 --> 07:58.364
- Do you think Superboy's ok? I
wasn't reading his mind, I swear,

07:58.432 --> 08:01.200
But anger flowed off
him in waves.

08:01.268 --> 08:04.604
- Heh. Surf that wave.
Just give him space.

08:04.672 --> 08:07.807
Me? Stick as close as you want.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.944
- Superboy just needs time to
cool off.

08:11.011 --> 08:13.613
A quiet mission will clear
his head.

08:27.695 --> 08:29.796
- Robin, Superboy, our truck
- kind of figured.

08:32.032 --> 08:34.400
- I hate monkeys.

08:41.880 --> 08:46.617
- Robot monkeys! Ha ha!
Totally Ivo's tweaked style.

08:51.724 --> 08:53.758
Hey, hey. Switch your ride
to battle mode.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.560
- No point.

08:57.629 --> 08:59.297
- Or not.

09:15.447 --> 09:18.082
Aah!

09:20.252 --> 09:21.419
Uh!

09:42.407 --> 09:45.743
- Huh? Wha...S-somebody, help!

10:03.862 --> 10:05.997
- Ugh!

10:09.735 --> 10:11.002
Aah!

10:15.240 --> 10:16.174
- Aah!

10:16.241 --> 10:18.509
- Aah!

10:37.462 --> 10:39.730
- Hyah! Hyah! Huh!

10:47.773 --> 10:49.006
Get out!

10:50.142 --> 10:51.909
Hyah!

11:15.934 --> 11:17.268
Superboy!

11:22.174 --> 11:24.942
- Aqualad to Robin. We've lost
our cargo. Did you--

11:25.010 --> 11:27.645
- It's gone. And so is
my partner.

11:27.713 --> 11:31.549
- Aqualad to Superboy. Radio
your position. We'll help you.

11:31.617 --> 11:34.619
- I don't need help,
don't want any!

11:35.721 --> 11:37.922
- Superboy?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.624
- I think he ditched his comp.

11:39.691 --> 11:43.461
- Super. Now we can't even
track him.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.897
- He's out of my telepathic
range.

11:45.964 --> 11:50.401
This professor Ivo, if he is alive,
seems to be two steps ahead of us.

11:50.469 --> 11:53.537
M-maybe w-we should contact
Red Tornado?

11:53.605 --> 11:56.440
- Tornado always tells us
to handle things ourselves.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.110
And the mission can still
succeed if we recover the parts

11:59.177 --> 12:00.511
Before they're reassembled.

12:00.579 --> 12:02.980
- Well, that's a great plan,
except for the part about us

12:03.048 --> 12:05.016
Not knowing where to look!

12:05.083 --> 12:06.918
- Maybe we do.

12:09.855 --> 12:13.057
We'd have heard by now if the
decoy trucks had been attacked.

12:13.125 --> 12:17.161
So how did these monkeys know
exactly which trucks to target?

12:17.229 --> 12:19.463
Ha! The parts have gps.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.732
The monkeys can track
the signal,

12:21.800 --> 12:24.001
Which means I can track them
with the one I captured.

12:24.069 --> 12:27.471
It looks both sets of parts
are converging on...

12:27.539 --> 12:29.507
Gotham city.

12:29.574 --> 12:32.777
- That far south? M'gann and I
won't get there anytime soon.

12:32.844 --> 12:36.147
I'm sending kid on ahead
to meet you. Aqualad out.

12:49.828 --> 12:53.531
- Definitely a disaster,
heavy on the "dis."

12:57.536 --> 12:58.669
- Apple pie.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.404
- The devil's food.

13:00.472 --> 13:03.841
- Something tells me this isn't
about dessert.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.843
- The boy needs you.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.913
- No. He needs you.
He needs red.

13:08.981 --> 13:11.349
I'm just a constant reminder
of what he's not.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.151
- Sorry, Clark, but you're
dead wrong.

13:15.287 --> 13:18.990
Look, I know he troubles you,
but he's here.

13:19.057 --> 13:22.626
You have to get over the how
and why.

13:22.694 --> 13:26.097
Trust me on this. This boy
needs his father.

13:26.164 --> 13:28.099
- I'm not his father.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.067
I'll take that pie to go.

13:54.526 --> 13:56.293
- Oh, hello.

13:56.361 --> 13:58.062
- You?

13:58.130 --> 14:00.798
You're Ivo? I'm whelmed.

14:00.866 --> 14:04.668
- You're one to talk. Now, since
when does the big blue boy scout

14:04.736 --> 14:06.137
Have a brat?

14:06.204 --> 14:07.705
- He doesn't.

14:07.773 --> 14:10.207
- Yeah, if you say so.

14:10.275 --> 14:14.812
Have you met my mobile optimal
neural quotient infiltrators?

14:20.919 --> 14:23.821
Ah. And after all the trouble
I went through finding

14:23.889 --> 14:27.358
An acronym for monqi.

14:30.896 --> 14:33.197
- Access Captain Atom.

14:33.265 --> 14:35.599
- Uh!

14:36.868 --> 14:39.937
- Since professor Ivo's
magnificent monqis

14:40.005 --> 14:41.672
Don't float your boat,

14:41.740 --> 14:45.776
Maybe my amazing Amazo
will better suit you

14:45.844 --> 14:48.679
Or better slay you.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.988
- Give me your best shot.

15:00.055 --> 15:01.022
- Ha ha ha!

15:01.090 --> 15:02.257
- Heh heh heh!

15:02.324 --> 15:06.194
- Please. My android has
the strength of Superman.

15:06.262 --> 15:08.930
What chance do you have?

15:08.998 --> 15:10.765
- Aah!

15:15.037 --> 15:18.573
- Oh, sorry.
Did that strike a nerve?

15:18.641 --> 15:22.844
Amazo, strike a few more.

15:22.912 --> 15:26.047
- Aah!

15:26.115 --> 15:29.083
- Access Black Canary.

15:30.452 --> 15:32.654
- Aah!

15:32.721 --> 15:35.456
Ohh!

15:35.524 --> 15:37.525
- Access Flash.

15:43.599 --> 15:47.035
- Oh. No wonder daddy
keeps you hidden away.

15:47.102 --> 15:51.172
You're not really doing justice
to the old "s" shield, are you?

15:51.240 --> 15:52.774
Ha!

15:52.842 --> 15:54.709
- Martian Manhunter.

15:59.748 --> 16:02.116
Access Superman.

16:04.954 --> 16:06.487
- Aah!

16:10.693 --> 16:12.227
Unh!

16:14.630 --> 16:16.831
- Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

16:16.899 --> 16:19.767
- Finish him. Priority alpha.

16:31.614 --> 16:32.947
- So you changed, too?

16:33.015 --> 16:35.550
- You kidding? Huhh.
I feel naked in civvies.

16:35.618 --> 16:36.818
You still tracking the parts?

16:36.886 --> 16:38.586
- They were heading
through Gotham,

16:38.654 --> 16:41.422
But they veered.

16:41.490 --> 16:44.525
Wait. Dude, they're
at my school.

16:54.670 --> 16:56.037
- Unh!

17:01.010 --> 17:02.443
Errgh!

17:05.513 --> 17:07.515
Aah! Unh!

17:09.351 --> 17:12.319
That...All you got?

17:12.387 --> 17:14.923
- Access Captain Atom.

17:26.602 --> 17:29.237
- I don't usually attend
these things in person,

17:29.305 --> 17:33.107
But--heh heh--this was
too good to miss.

17:33.175 --> 17:35.610
- Access Superman.

17:44.687 --> 17:45.920
- Yoink!

17:48.657 --> 17:51.292
- Martian Manhunter.

17:51.360 --> 17:55.430
Access Red Tornado.

17:55.497 --> 17:57.098
- Aah!
- Aah!

18:00.970 --> 18:03.171
- Access Captain Atom.

18:06.608 --> 18:08.943
Access Black Canary.

18:11.347 --> 18:12.747
Superman.

18:14.850 --> 18:16.818
Martian Manhunter.

18:21.690 --> 18:23.391
Superman.

18:23.459 --> 18:24.792
- Aah!

18:24.860 --> 18:27.161
- Martian Manhunter.

18:33.702 --> 18:36.371
Access Black Canary.

18:40.142 --> 18:41.676
Superman.

18:57.526 --> 18:59.260
- Access Black Canary.

18:59.328 --> 19:02.764
- Oh, yawn. Normally,
Amazo would study and mimic

19:02.831 --> 19:05.767
Your abilities during battle,
but what's the point?

19:05.834 --> 19:09.070
You're all such poor copies
of the originals.

19:09.138 --> 19:10.705
- Ha ha ha!

19:10.773 --> 19:12.974
- So everyone keeps saying.

19:13.042 --> 19:16.878
It makes me angry!

19:16.945 --> 19:19.047
- Aah!

19:19.114 --> 19:21.582
- Want to see me
channel that anger?

19:21.650 --> 19:23.451
- Great. He's gone
ballistic again.

19:23.519 --> 19:25.053
- Maybe not.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.089
- Amazo, protect your master.
Priority alpha.

19:28.157 --> 19:29.557
- Unh!

19:29.625 --> 19:31.325
- Captain Atom.

19:33.462 --> 19:36.864
- Anyone want to play keep-away?

19:36.932 --> 19:37.999
- Me, me!

19:38.067 --> 19:42.103
- Access Superman.

19:42.171 --> 19:43.871
- Aah!

19:43.939 --> 19:47.408
- Martian Manhunter.

19:47.476 --> 19:49.043
- Superman.

19:58.420 --> 20:00.254
- Help me disassemble him now!

20:00.322 --> 20:02.457
- Dude, the guy has no head.

20:02.524 --> 20:05.393
- Don't take any chances.

20:05.461 --> 20:07.595
- Superboy, are you all right?

20:07.663 --> 20:10.798
- I'm fine.
Feeling the aster.

20:10.866 --> 20:13.134
- Hey. Where's Ivo?

20:21.743 --> 20:24.011
- The Amazo android is
in pieces again,

20:24.079 --> 20:27.348
Safely being analyzed at
the two separate S.T.A.R. labs,

20:27.416 --> 20:28.950
But Ivo escaped,
and since he

20:29.017 --> 20:31.219
Originated the tech,
he's arguably

20:31.286 --> 20:33.154
More dangerous than the android.

20:33.222 --> 20:35.623
- Capturing the professor
ill be a League priority.

20:35.691 --> 20:38.126
- But we understand
your mission encountered

20:38.193 --> 20:40.962
Other complications.

20:43.031 --> 20:45.333
- Complications come
with the job.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.202
Your ability to handle them
has impressed the League.

20:48.270 --> 20:49.937
- The whole League?

20:50.005 --> 20:52.373
- Given time, yes.

20:52.441 --> 20:56.878
Kryptonians, as you know,
have very hard heads.

20:56.945 --> 20:59.514
Of course, there's no shame
in asking for help.

20:59.581 --> 21:02.383
That's why the League exists--
because there are some problems

21:02.451 --> 21:04.418
Even we can't
handle individually.

21:04.486 --> 21:06.754
- Please. If we needed help,
we'd never get

21:06.822 --> 21:08.656
The chance to ask.

21:08.724 --> 21:10.158
Look familiar?

21:10.225 --> 21:12.293
You were following us!
Babysitting!

21:12.361 --> 21:13.594
You still don't trust us.

21:13.662 --> 21:15.830
- We didn't follow you.

21:15.898 --> 21:19.066
- And that's not your arrow,
but that means--

21:19.134 --> 21:22.069
- Speedy!
- He has our backs.

21:22.137 --> 21:23.638
- Souvenir!

21:25.741 --> 21:28.609
- Ahem.

21:28.677 --> 21:29.844
I'm ready.

21:29.912 --> 21:31.960
- Good. Because I'm here.
