I think I was trying to

avoid them just because of how
much I was hurt in the past.

1:01:49.873 --> 1:01:52.742

to admit it,

literally in a week, like,

where I'm at with, like,
my expectations

1:03:09.486 --> 1:03:13.690

1:03:18.361 --> 1:03:22.599
do you feel that same way
with somebody else?

Or have you, like,
slept with another woman?

1:03:27.704 --> 1:03:31.174
Like, those are things that,
like, I think would be, like,

1:03:31.241 --> 1:03:34.144
impossible to move forward
towards an engagement.

with somebody else,

1:03:41.518 --> 1:03:47.390

I mean, I understand, like,
that thought process,

1:04:01.805 --> 1:04:04.107
and it is--
like, for me, I think

1:04:04.174 --> 1:04:06.376
the big thing
that I'm shocked at is,

1:04:06.443 --> 1:04:09.646
like, you did say
to, like, explore, like,

1:04:09.713 --> 1:04:14.551

1:04:14.617 --> 1:04:16.052

it was about, you know, like,

fall in love
with multiple women,

1:05:13.710 --> 1:05:17.147

1:05:17.213 --> 1:05:20.283
is that, where I stand,

or even this week, but like,

but I didn't want
to ask you to do that.

1:05:56.753 --> 1:05:58.221

if that were the case, like,

I don't want you to, like,

if you can continue forward,
it just like--it's, like,

to hear all this, like,

1:06:43.099 --> 1:06:46.236

makes me feel worse and, like,

1:06:46.302 --> 1:06:50.273

important that was to you,

1:08:12.155 --> 1:08:13.790
that that was literally
a deal-breaker,

1:08:13.856 --> 1:08:15.992
I would have changed the way
that I approached things

1:08:16.059 --> 1:08:17.760

1:08:17.827 --> 1:08:19.896
I mean, I'm sorry that

1:08:19.963 --> 1:08:23.032

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:25.768

that's worth fighting for.

1:08:36.746 --> 1:08:38.481

1:08:38.548 --> 1:08:39.949
my biggest fears,
like, in telling you,

1:08:40.016 --> 1:08:42.418

relationships is that, like,

1:08:42.485 --> 1:08:44.787
I didn't want to have to share,
like, your heart or your love.

1:08:44.854 --> 1:08:46.756
And I know you're saying,
like, you would be able to,

1:08:46.823 --> 1:08:48.625
like, close that off.

1:08:48.691 --> 1:08:53.896

somebody who would have...

1:08:55.498 --> 1:08:57.367

like thought through that.

1:08:57.433 --> 1:08:58.668
I don't--I don't know, like...

1:08:58.735 --> 1:09:00.470

and there are times

1:09:00.536 --> 1:09:02.538

those challenging times,

1:09:02.605 --> 1:09:04.641

is it worth fighting for?

1:09:04.707 --> 1:09:07.043

that that person, like,

1:09:07.110 --> 1:09:09.178
is special and you
don't want to lose them.

1:09:09.245 --> 1:09:11.881
Let's work through it, like,
that's what a relationship is,

1:09:11.948 --> 1:09:14.817
it's working through the hard
times, because this isn't--

1:09:14.884 --> 1:09:17.253

word you're saying, for sure.

would any of this, like,

1:09:26.629 --> 1:09:29.699
being able to talk through it,
like, to me, it's like,

1:09:29.766 --> 1:09:31.901
worth spending an extra
seven hours talking through

1:09:31.968 --> 1:09:34.137

- I agree, like,
I do think we have something

1:09:43.112 --> 1:09:44.681
special so I don't know,
it's like--it's like,

1:09:44.747 --> 1:09:47.383
I'm so confused, like, this
is so confusing for me to be

1:09:47.450 --> 1:09:51.421
in this situation because,
like, I couldn't have imagined,

1:09:51.487 --> 1:09:55.792
like, a scenario in which,
like, you become physically

1:09:55.858 --> 1:09:57.727
intimate with any other person
and it's me at the end.

1:09:57.794 --> 1:09:59.162
Like, I just--I...

1:09:59.228 --> 1:10:00.563
- No one told me I had
to go sleep with somebody,

1:10:00.630 --> 1:10:03.733
okay, like I was in l--I was,
you know, having feelings

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:05.334
of love with these--
with--with--with this--

1:10:05.401 --> 1:10:07.637
this person
and I slept with them

1:10:07.704 --> 1:10:09.739
because I love this person,

1:10:09.806 --> 1:10:13.376
so I'm going to, like,
see, like, how the physical

1:10:13.443 --> 1:10:16.713
connection is because, like,
you would just explore that.

1:10:16.779 --> 1:10:18.147
If you were in love
with somebody, then you would

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:19.782
explore that--it wasn't
like I was just sleeping with

1:10:19.849 --> 1:10:21.751
somebody because I'm like,
they're here so I'm

1:10:21.818 --> 1:10:23.252
just gonna sleep with them.
- Right, I get that.

1:10:23.319 --> 1:10:26.856
- So I--me sleeping
with, like, with...

1:10:27.857 --> 1:10:29.559
Both.
- Mm-hmm.

1:10:29.625 --> 1:10:32.161
- Was because I've somehow
fallen in love

1:10:32.228 --> 1:10:35.164
with three women,
and it makes zero sense to me.

1:10:35.231 --> 1:10:37.900
And, but the thing is,
is it's, like, I literally

1:10:37.967 --> 1:10:40.570
didn't understand how it could,
and I freaked out,

1:10:40.636 --> 1:10:42.739
and I cried about it,
because I was like,

1:10:42.805 --> 1:10:45.141
I'm going to hurt somebody
and, like, this scares me.

1:10:45.208 --> 1:10:46.676
But then I was like,
you know what, like,

1:10:46.743 --> 1:10:48.945
at the same time, I'm finding
what I'm looking for here

1:10:49.011 --> 1:10:50.146

to press forward

1:10:50.213 --> 1:10:51.447
with the relationships I have,

1:10:51.514 --> 1:10:53.316
like, I will walk out
of here with one person

1:10:53.382 --> 1:10:55.351
because they were
the best person for me.

1:10:55.418 --> 1:10:59.055

I don't know, I can't--

this could go and, like,

a single scenario in which

1:11:06.362 --> 1:11:08.698
those are true and, like,
I can move forward.

1:11:11.501 --> 1:11:13.736

this is shattering me.

1:11:13.803 --> 1:11:15.772

and I see you in front of me

1:11:15.838 --> 1:11:16.973

why wouldn't you have
told me early on?

1:11:22.879 --> 1:11:25.348
You let us get all the way
to this point and then you just

don't tell me until now

1:16:32.188 --> 1:16:34.557

you have said to me tonight,

1:16:34.623 --> 1:16:37.726
like, and it's actually,
like, made me rethink,

1:16:37.793 --> 1:16:39.061
like, did I go about
this the wrong way?

1:16:39.128 --> 1:16:40.596
Like, was I expecting too much?

1:16:40.663 --> 1:16:42.698
Or like, you know, it's made
me think those things, but then

1:16:42.765 --> 1:16:44.400
at the same time I'm like,
but you had sex with two women.

1:16:44.467 --> 1:16:47.203
- If--if you had this
big old reservation, this huge

1:16:47.269 --> 1:16:50.473
deal-breaker, why would you not
bring this up until right now?

1:16:50.539 --> 1:16:52.374

like, you're not--like, I feel

1:16:52.441 --> 1:16:54.944
like at this point, like, I'm
going home for sure now, like,

1:16:55.010 --> 1:16:57.379
you're--you are committed
to me going home at this point.

1:16:57.446 --> 1:16:58.547
And, like, that's okay, like,

1:16:58.614 --> 1:17:00.049
I realize
I [bleep] this up and like...

1:17:00.116 --> 1:17:02.184
- What do you mean, don't--
you're putting this on me now.

1:17:02.251 --> 1:17:03.486
- I'm not. I'm not.

1:17:03.552 --> 1:17:04.920
- You made the decision
when I walked back in.

1:17:04.987 --> 1:17:06.388

like, I realize and, like,

1:17:06.455 --> 1:17:08.624
it feels very much like this
is, like, ending and, like--

1:17:08.691 --> 1:17:09.959
- Because you put an end to it.

1:17:10.025 --> 1:17:11.994

but, like, I still feel

1:17:12.061 --> 1:17:14.497
strongly about
what I'm feeling.

1:17:14.563 --> 1:17:15.865

trying to place any

1:17:15.931 --> 1:17:17.633

but the fact of the matter is,

1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:19.902

part in all of this.

1:17:24.306 --> 1:17:25.407

that's upsetting to me.

1:17:28.210 --> 1:17:29.311

dropped a bombshell on me--

1:17:29.378 --> 1:17:30.579
you just dropped
a bombshell on me.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:32.281

how you went about this.

1:17:33.616 --> 1:17:36.318

and, like, just, we're done.

1:17:36.385 --> 1:17:38.420
And I'm done--I'm done.
We're not getting

1:17:38.487 --> 1:17:39.922

we're saying anymore.

1:17:39.989 --> 1:17:41.290

1:17:41.357 --> 1:17:42.658

that I even raised my voice

1:17:42.725 --> 1:17:44.293
because this is--this
is out of character for me.

1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:47.062

at this point nothing you--
nothing I can say will, like,

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:17.927

but like, I genuinely, like,

1:18:17.993 --> 1:18:24.633

was real for me and, like...

1:18:30.105 --> 1:18:32.942

that you probably hate me

1:18:37.513 --> 1:18:40.983
at this point, and, like,
I'm genuinely so sorry for,

1:18:41.050 --> 1:18:42.918
like, the pain I've
caused you and, like,

1:18:42.985 --> 1:18:46.655

gone down tonight in every way.

1:18:54.930 --> 1:18:56.932

I'll say.

1:18:58.534 --> 1:18:59.602
Because of my faith,
I believe everything

1:18:59.668 --> 1:19:01.704

1:19:01.770 --> 1:19:04.006
And I'm just gonna take
that and move forward

in my life and realize that,
like, I had to go through this.

1:19:06.041 --> 1:19:09.211
So at some point, I'll end up
finding somebody that actually

1:19:09.278 --> 1:19:11.580

understand me for who I am,
