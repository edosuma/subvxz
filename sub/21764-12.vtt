What?

00:47.005 --> 00:48.882
You're getting married?

00:48.965 --> 00:49.883
No. Well, yes.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.926
Well, I think so. It's complicated!

00:52.010 --> 00:55.889
Word of advice, make sure your stump
is big enough for her.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.974
Happy wife, happy life.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.604
Clover, as your king, I demand to know
who this woman is you're marrying!

01:02.687 --> 01:04.022
I'm not marrying a woman!

01:04.105 --> 01:05.106
I'm marrying Sage!

01:05.190 --> 01:06.900
Maybe. Look, he hasn't proposed.

01:06.983 --> 01:10.070
But he says he has something
important he wants to tell me.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.196
What else could it be?

01:11.279 --> 01:12.572
Okay, good point.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.158
I don't know, like, maybe anything!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.327
Well, I guess we shouldn't be surprised.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.663
I mean, after five seasons,
the romantic tension is, you know.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.540
I know, right?

01:22.624 --> 01:25.168
But it's not all about that.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.171
I mean, I do get control of his army...

01:28.254 --> 01:31.382
...and all of its deadly weapons!

01:31.466 --> 01:33.134
Okay, pump the brakes for a second.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.929
Now l-let's just think about this,
okay, Clo

01:36.012 --> 01:39.849
If you marry Sage,
your commute is going to be redonkulous.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.728
The Mountain Lemur Kingdom is, like,
way on the other side of the island, dude.

01:43.812 --> 01:48.108
King Julien, if I marry Sage,
that means I'm his queen,

01:48.191 --> 01:52.028
which--which means
I can't live here anymore.

01:53.696 --> 01:57.450
I always figured if Clover left,
it would be because she was eaten

01:57.534 --> 01:59.077
while trying to save me.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.538
Is there no loyalty left anymore?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.456
We're just gonna have to face it,
Your Majesty.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.917
Clover's not gonna be here
to protect us anymore.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.837
We could capture her and keep her
locked away for a couple of years

02:08.920 --> 02:10.547
until she forgets Sage.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.758
No, this is a wonderful thing
that's happened to Clover.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.469
She's getting the promotion
she's always deserved,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.888
and we need to be supportive.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.057
Clover's abandoning us, you guys!

02:22.183 --> 02:24.853
-I say we take the traitor out!
-Yeah!

02:24.936 --> 02:26.271
Now hold on.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.398
Clover's always been there for us.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.817
Well, she's not here now. Burn the witch!

02:30.900 --> 02:32.277
Clover is not a witch.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.320
Your Majesty, you have to stop this.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.491
Lemurs of Madagascar, I feel your pain.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.327
I, too, was shocked
when I found out Clover was a witch.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.789
-Not a witch.
-But we are lemurs.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.334
And what do lemurs do
when faced with change?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.253
-We're all gonna...
-No!

02:50.336 --> 02:51.337
Maybe.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.674
But we are the lemurs
who defeated the mighty Koto

02:54.757 --> 02:57.135
during the infamous war of the beasts,

02:57.218 --> 02:59.220
bringing peace throughout the land.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.431
Yeah, he's right.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.975
Even Mary Ann and I have reconciled.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.436
I have the open wounds to prove it.

03:06.519 --> 03:10.273
It's time we declared our independence
from Clover.

03:10.356 --> 03:14.694
It is time we learned
to protect ourselves.

03:14.777 --> 03:19.365
Peoples, it is time to form an army.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.834
Remember, Clover, even though
Sage is your sort-of-ex-boyfriend

03:29.918 --> 03:32.128
whose sculpted body your consciousness
once occupied,

03:32.211 --> 03:35.465
when he asks you to be his queen,
act surprised.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.389
Oi! Who's the king of this dump, eh?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.600
Think I'd like to have a go with him!

03:45.683 --> 03:47.518
Clover, I've been waiting for you.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.062
Oh, really?

03:49.145 --> 03:51.940
And why is that, big fella, eh?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.150
Something you want to tell me? Wink, wink.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.109
Clover...

03:55.193 --> 03:56.152
Yes, Sage.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.405
The cornrows of destiny have woven us
a shared fate.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.574
I no longer consider you separate

04:01.658 --> 04:04.285
but more an appendage
that grew from me over time

04:04.369 --> 04:08.873
that I should have removed with surgery
but now find indispensable.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.500
I feel the same way.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.629
For too long, I have spooned
with only plants and grubs.

04:14.712 --> 04:19.175
But now I need something
not covered in mucus.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.343
-Clover...
-I do!

04:20.426 --> 04:22.011
-Sorry, sorry.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.223
Jumped the gun a bit there.
Little excited.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.933
Continue.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.811
Clover, I wanted you to know this
before anyone else.

04:29.894 --> 04:30.979
I'm getting married,

04:31.062 --> 04:33.189
and I'd like to introduce you
to my fiancée.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.193
Oh, look at you, Mr. Comedian.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.488
Yeah.
Yeah, of course I know your fiancée.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.782
-It's--

04:42.865 --> 04:43.908
Crimson?

04:43.992 --> 04:45.994
Oh, isn't it amazing?

04:46.077 --> 04:48.538
Sage and I are getting hitched.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.165
Oh, I'm going to be a queen.

04:55.253 --> 04:58.339
All right, listen up, maggots!

04:58.423 --> 05:01.259
Today we learn how to army-ify ourselves.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.386
And that means we got to be tough.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.304
Fierce!

05:04.387 --> 05:07.015
Let's hear some fierce roars, maggots!

05:10.393 --> 05:11.686
Ted!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.733
Now, repeat after me.

05:16.816 --> 05:17.817
This is my mango.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.153
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.821
This is my mango.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.823
-There are many mangoes...
-There are many mangoes.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.408
And I like 'em,
and I'ma eat 'em all,

05:25.491 --> 05:27.076
so stay away from my mangoes!

05:28.619 --> 05:29.704
My bad.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.956
Chimichanga?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
Can anyone tell me

05:33.833 --> 05:36.753
what is the most important thing
a soldier needs

05:36.836 --> 05:38.212
when he goes to war?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.006
A change of underwear?

05:40.089 --> 05:42.508
Something to keep you warm
in the foxhole at night,

05:42.592 --> 05:44.343
like the hug of an old friend.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.054
I ain't your friend, Pancho.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.140
-Aw, whatever you say, you big softy.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.725
Wrong! All of you, wrong!

05:50.808 --> 05:55.813
The most important thing a soldier needs
is a nickname.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.691
Nurse Phantom,
from now on, you'll be called...

05:58.775 --> 06:00.068
-...Slurpee.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.819
I dub you Grumbler.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.404
I'm not apologizing.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.947
-Thigh Master.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.032
Tiny Dancer.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.077
Either Captain Cankle
or the Incredible Sulk.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.620
I'll let you choose.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.038
George Washingturd.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.583
-Guy No One Likes.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.834
Auntie Pickle Bottom.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.669
Hmm. Mort.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.464
Yay! I've always wanted a nickname!

06:21.547 --> 06:24.092
A soldier's bed is his home.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.928
Tidy home, tidy mind.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.179
No.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.305
Disgusting!

06:29.388 --> 06:30.306
Obscene!

06:30.389 --> 06:33.226
Does no one know how to tuck in a corner?

06:33.309 --> 06:35.812
Fluff this pillow. It's making me sick!

06:35.895 --> 06:38.815
What does any of this have to do with...

06:38.898 --> 06:41.275
...defending ourselves?

06:41.359 --> 06:42.735
What's that, Señor Koogle?

06:42.819 --> 06:46.322
I didn't hear that over the screams
of your fellow soldiers

06:46.405 --> 06:51.828
who would be alive right now
if their beds had been made properly!

06:51.911 --> 06:53.621
Nice job, Thigh Master.

06:53.704 --> 06:54.622
Thank you, Your--

06:54.705 --> 06:56.582
I didn't say you could speak, maggot!

06:56.666 --> 06:57.875
Drop and give me 20!

06:57.959 --> 07:01.295
Hey, did you hide the explosives
in case we need to make a quick escape?

07:01.379 --> 07:05.383
Sure indeedy.
Got 'em in a place he'll never find.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.718
Very nice.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.596
But can they pass the quarter test?

07:15.935 --> 07:18.062
I don't know, but I've been told...

07:18.146 --> 07:20.481
I don't know, but I've been told.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.692
King Julien's booty is made of gold.
King Julien's booty is made of gold.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.822
Forget this soldier jive, son.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.700
I am a lover, not a...

07:38.249 --> 07:40.877
How did this happen? Sage is a warrior!

07:40.960 --> 07:42.670
I am a warrior.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.590
He is supposed to be with me!

07:48.259 --> 07:51.095
This is not how the story's
supposed to end.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.764
I didn't raise you to be
a quitter, Baby Brawler.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.433
That voice. Grandma Rose?

07:55.516 --> 07:57.310
Ah, don't look so surprised.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.188
I'm still keeping an eye on ya
up in Frankri-La.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.148
I've been such a fool, Grandma Rose.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.358
Thought I was living in one
of my own stories,

08:04.442 --> 08:05.568
happy ending and all.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.486
Hey!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.821
Ah, quit your whining,
or you'll get some more.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.699
You think you're the first gal
to get your true love stolen?

08:11.782 --> 08:14.535
-There has got to be some--
-That wasn't a question.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.913
It's too late. Crimson already won.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.624
It ain't over till it's over,
Baby Brawler.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.834
You might not know this,
but there was a time

08:21.918 --> 08:25.004
I almost lost your Grandpa Rose
to another lemur.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.381
Her name was Maxine.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.634
I out-cooked and out-danced her. And when that didn't work, I ate her.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.262
You ate her?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.805
It was a simpler time.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.432
I'm not eating my sister.

08:36.516 --> 08:40.186
Eh, that's your call.
Point is, Baby Brawler, you're like me.

08:40.269 --> 08:44.690
So stop your whining
and start acting like a true warrior.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.986
I hope you enjoyed the sandwiches.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.614
As long as it's not someone I know

08:51.697 --> 08:54.283
between these bread slices, I am...

08:54.367 --> 08:56.244
...good.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.162
Oh, you're sweet.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.455
Mmm.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.249
Is your cologne new?

09:01.332 --> 09:03.084
I'm not wearing cologne.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.461
That's what I thought.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.463
-Okay, Mary Ann, please.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.049
Can't you wait until I'm finished eating?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.009
I'm sorry, Horst.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.805
When I'm near you,
I can't control my hunger.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.516
And that's why I love you, sweetheart.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.104
The whole kingdom's gone
cuckoo crazy birds

09:23.187 --> 09:26.983
ever since they found out
Clover was leaving to get married.

09:27.066 --> 09:31.237
No one thinks we can defend the kingdom
anymore without her.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.282
Clover gone?

09:34.365 --> 09:36.367
Lemur kingdom weak.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.244
Foosa attack!

09:38.327 --> 09:40.037
But Mary Ann Queen.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.582
She say no hurt lemur.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.209
Mary Ann compromised.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.503
Bone Foosa in charge now.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.510
Here you go, boys.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.887
Mango, pineapple, jungle moss,

09:56.971 --> 09:59.390
and a hint of fire ant juice for a kick.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.561
I call it the crimson spanker.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.772
Perfect for our wedding reception,
Sagey-wagey.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.817
These savage warriors don't need
some of that fruity tipple.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.110
They need a real drink.

10:11.193 --> 10:15.114
Volcanic ash, tree sap,
and a healthy dose of maggots for protein.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.200
Wolf it in one, lads and ladies.
Easier that way.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.291
Good maggots. Fresh.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.963
Sage, you are the king of my heart.

10:31.047 --> 10:35.635
May the sky gods bestow upon you
a crown of dragonfly wings

10:35.718 --> 10:38.763
and encase you in the rays of their love.

10:38.846 --> 10:42.475
And may we, together,
conquer all the world's ills.

10:42.558 --> 10:46.604
Starting with those people
who push bulky baby strollers

10:46.687 --> 10:48.356
down the middle of a narrow path.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.316
-It's really just inconsiderate.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.318
Oh, and people who RSVP for a party

10:52.401 --> 10:53.819
and then don't show up.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.988
I mean, really, how hard is it
to send a note?

10:56.072 --> 10:58.491
-Aww.
-So sweet.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.160
Yeah! Okay.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.704
"Dragonfly wing crown." Please.

11:03.788 --> 11:07.083
All right, sorry, sis, only one writer
in this family, and that's me!

11:07.166 --> 11:09.669
I've got a story for you, Sage.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.837
"Thigh Sander Plunder Horse

11:11.921 --> 11:14.173
split the air with her mage sword

11:14.256 --> 11:19.053
as its eldritch claws ripped the heads off
of Thigh Sander's unicorn army

11:19.136 --> 11:22.306
and unicorn essence exploded into the air,

11:22.390 --> 11:27.103
smelling of regret and the tears
of orphaned children."

11:27.186 --> 11:29.647
The unicorns died?

11:30.981 --> 11:33.234
Ugh. Mm-mm-mm.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.235
It's good,

11:34.318 --> 11:37.154
but not exactly right for wedding vows.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.907
All right, listen up, maggots.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.786
We had planned an obstacle course
for today's training,

11:43.869 --> 11:45.996
but because of budget
and time constraints,

11:46.080 --> 11:47.373
we're just gonna show the highlight reel.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.791
-Hit it.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.253
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

11:52.336 --> 11:54.547

11:54.630 --> 11:56.715

12:16.861 --> 12:18.946
Congratulations, you're all failures.

12:19.029 --> 12:22.867
Moving on, we're going to have a war game.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.286
It's like a battle, only it's fake,

12:25.369 --> 12:27.163
and it doesn't take a whole season.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.956
Who's the target, King J?

12:29.039 --> 12:30.332
I'm locked and loaded.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.376
Ted, it's all yours.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.669
Thanks, Your Majesty.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.713
All right, you maggots,

12:35.796 --> 12:37.548
who wants to put on a play?

12:37.631 --> 12:40.593
War games, Ted.
I said "war games," not "play."

12:40.676 --> 12:44.054
Who are we supposed to be fighting
when the whole kingdom is right here?

12:44.138 --> 12:45.347
It's a secret.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.477
<i>How did my life come to this?</i>

12:49.560 --> 12:52.146
<i>I was gonna build things</i>
<i>out of matchsticks.</i>

12:52.229 --> 12:53.689
<i>Why do I even stay?</i>

12:53.772 --> 12:56.525
<i>Because if you didn't,</i>
<i>no one would pay attention to you.</i>

12:56.609 --> 12:58.360
<i>Mort, are you in my head?</i>

12:58.444 --> 12:59.487
<i>Maybe.</i>

12:59.570 --> 13:01.572
<i>Now keep your thoughts down, old man.</i>

13:01.655 --> 13:04.241
<i>We are preparing for war!</i>

13:04.325 --> 13:07.244
Mary Ann, please, can't we just talk?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.081
Your smell is driving me crazy.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.585
Just a nibble.
I'll try not to leave a scar.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.253
Yeah, but if you eat me now, there will be nothing left to...

13:18.005 --> 13:19.965
...love.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.594
Bone Foosa?

13:23.677 --> 13:25.554
What is the meaning of this?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.680
Traitor!

13:26.764 --> 13:28.807
What are you talking about?

13:28.891 --> 13:31.810
Horst? Please, so I like to play
with my food.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.354
What of it?

13:33.437 --> 13:36.148
You betray foosa for lemur.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.984
Bone Foosa in charge now.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.283
Great meal, Mistress Crimson.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.912
Nice change from the dried roots
and compost patties we've been eating.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.539
Oh, it's nothing, Captain.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.917
Anything to make
my Sagey-bear's minions happy.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.213
Right, so where am I sleeping?

13:59.296 --> 14:01.549
Oh, are you staying?

14:01.632 --> 14:03.384
Mountain Lemurs are pack animals.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.428
Tradition dictates we sleep together
for security, warmth,

14:06.512 --> 14:07.930
and occasional tickle fights.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.767
Wow! Just the one tent for all of you.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.311
We advise visitors sleep outside the tent,

14:14.395 --> 14:17.523
preferably as far away as possible,
for your own safety.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.900
-I'd rather not go into detail.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.778
Is Crimson sleeping in the tent?

14:22.862 --> 14:23.779
Oh, no.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.574
Oh, I've got a yurt just over the hill.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.075
Only fits one, though.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.785
So sorry, Clo-Clo.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.328
Guess that's good-bye, then.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.746
On the contrary.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.083
I, unlike you,
appreciate Sage's traditions.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.252
Ergo, I will be sleeping with the pack.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.129
-Clover.
-I'm a big girl, Sage.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.298
I can make my own decisions
about my safety.

14:42.381 --> 14:46.343
Suit yourself. Good night, angel-pecs.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.429
-Mwah.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.097
Ugh.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.584
Xixi here reporting live
from the battlefield.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.586
These troopers are ready for anything. But what they want most of all

15:22.671 --> 15:24.548
is to make it home alive.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.259
Xixi, knock it off.
Everyone's going home alive.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.429
Now, that would be a Christmas miracle,
wouldn't it, folks?

15:30.512 --> 15:32.598
Excuse me, trooper. Why did you enlist?

15:32.681 --> 15:33.724
Enlist?

15:33.807 --> 15:36.560
You saying we had a choice
about being out here?

15:36.644 --> 15:39.104
Everyone is here because they want to be.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.898
Yeah, that's a big no!

15:40.981 --> 15:42.650
Are you saying there's a cover

15:42.733 --> 15:43.651
-Xixi, out!

15:43.734 --> 15:45.694
Media shouldn't even be in the foxhole
with us.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.905
You're giving everything away
to the enemy!

15:49.448 --> 15:51.116
What was that?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.701
All right, maggots, here we go.

15:54.286 --> 15:58.165
Mort, take George Washingturd
and Wild Style and check it out.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.961
Take Butterfish and Pancho!

16:03.629 --> 16:06.757
Okay, full disclosure,
I'm rocking a double hernia right now,

16:06.840 --> 16:10.052
so if either of you take shrapnel,
you can carry yourself.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.263
-Butterfish too pretty to die.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.024
Foosa.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.861
Let's get out of here!

16:29.822 --> 16:31.448
Whew.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.909
Hey, man, you just kicked me
in the armpit.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.827
Uncool, bra--

16:36.412 --> 16:37.579
Leg cramp.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.001
Hold on, guys. No one gets left behind.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.963
Put your telescope away, Thigh Master.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.424
It's been hours. Obviously they're dead.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.386
It's only been ten minutes,
and this is pretend, remember?

16:52.469 --> 16:54.096
No one is dying. Wait.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.015
-I see something.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.059
Feet!

17:00.227 --> 17:01.395
Oh, the feet!

17:01.478 --> 17:03.439
Get the little fella some water. Stat!

17:03.522 --> 17:05.482
The feet is all I need. Uh...

17:09.153 --> 17:11.613
I told you I would come back
for you, my love.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.282
-Foosa.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.075
Headed for kingdom.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.245
But they're not even our enemies anymore.

17:18.328 --> 17:22.041
Of course. Duh, this is Ted's surprise.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.669
He's probably using the rats
to dress up like foosa for a sneak attack.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.087
Clever.

17:27.171 --> 17:30.049
But I'm cleverer.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.135
Huddle up, maggots. I got a plan.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.554
I'm sorry, Horst.

17:35.637 --> 17:38.724
My people have betrayed us both.

17:38.807 --> 17:43.020
As long as we have each other,
Mary Ann, there is still hope.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.898
What are you doing?

17:45.981 --> 17:48.484
Well, your maulings over the years
have left my bones...

17:48.567 --> 17:50.694
-...and cartilage quite pliable.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.321
If I can just...

17:52.404 --> 17:54.073
-Oh, Horst.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.451
Mauling yourself
is the most romantic thing

17:57.534 --> 18:00.662
anyone has ever done for me.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.582
Maybe now you'll believe me when I say...

18:03.665 --> 18:05.459
...I love you.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.712
Quick!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.672
We have to warn King Julien.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.843
Clover, you're leaving?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.178
Sage. Yeah.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.387
Yeah, I got to fly.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.389
Uh, time to get back to my own kingdom.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.851
King Julien, clearly, he needs me,
and--and you...

18:22.935 --> 18:23.894
Rawr.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.104
...don't.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.314
Oh, going already, are we, sis?

18:27.397 --> 18:28.982
Aw, so sad.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.276
You were just starting to feel
like family.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.237
What? I am family!

18:35.989 --> 18:38.033
Have a nice life, you two.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.244
-Miss Clover, glad we caught you.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.203
I'll say.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.206
I don't know what you did
during our dance lesson yesterday,

18:44.289 --> 18:45.958
but my sciatica is gone!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.084
What?

18:47.167 --> 18:49.545
And my men can't stop talking
about your protein drink.

18:49.628 --> 18:53.507
If I hear "yoked" one more time,
heads are ending up on spikes.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.134
But you vomited on me.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.762
Yeah, well, getting vomited on
is a sign of respect in our culture.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.389
Of course it is. But Crimson...

19:00.472 --> 19:03.433
No offense, but we wouldn't be caught dead
vomiting on your sister.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.103
-He's right.
-Tell us some more violent stories.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.021
-Don't go yet.
-All right, everyone, move it along.

19:08.105 --> 19:08.981
Moving it along.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.608
My sister has a very long walk
ahead of her.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.652
Isn't that right, Clo

19:13.735 --> 19:17.489
Good-bye.
So sorry you can't make the wedding.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.575
Right. See you around, Crimson.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.619
Clover, you should stay.
At least for the wedding.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.830
Sorry.  You made your choice.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.416
And I'm gonna make mine. Good-bye, Sage.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.089
<i>Why do I feel so strange?</i>

19:34.173 --> 19:37.301
<i>Like the time butterfly larvae hatched</i>
<i>in my stomach</i>

19:37.384 --> 19:39.344
<i>and then became trapped in my intestines</i>

19:39.428 --> 19:41.638
<i>as they fought each other for survival.</i>

19:41.722 --> 19:46.643
<i>This feels like that, only...</i>
<i>nicer and not so flappy.</i>

19:46.727 --> 19:49.438
<i>Could it be?</i>

19:52.649 --> 19:53.942
Attack!

19:57.487 --> 20:03.076
♪ ♪

20:06.079 --> 20:08.498
-Huts empty.
-No lemur.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.458
Impossible.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.876
Look again.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.545
Don't bother! You've already lost.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.755
Now!

20:16.465 --> 20:18.258
No!

20:18.342 --> 20:21.011
Actually, yes!

20:21.094 --> 20:24.389
See? We out-surprised your attack
with our own surprise attack!

20:25.390 --> 20:26.225
Bagada-booyah!

20:26.308 --> 20:27.643
It really worked, Your Majesty.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.144
I wonder if it'll do the same

20:29.228 --> 20:31.730
against the real foosa
instead of Ted's costumes.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.441
Ted, my lemur!

20:34.524 --> 20:36.401
Nice surprise with the foosa suits.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.863
Well, thanks, King J,
but I didn't make any costumes.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.700
My big surprise is snickerdoodles!
Hurray!

20:43.784 --> 20:46.828
Thanks for all the hard work, maggots.

20:46.912 --> 20:50.958
But if you didn't make
foosa suits, that means...

20:54.127 --> 20:57.256
We were fighting real foosa!

20:57.339 --> 21:00.008
Aah!
We're all gonna die for real this time!

21:00.092 --> 21:03.220
Foosa!

21:04.263 --> 21:06.807
King Julien!

21:06.890 --> 21:09.059
I'm sorry. I had no part in this.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.896
But rest assured, the ringleader
will be severely punished.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.191
-Horst, I need you to wait here.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.944
Of course, my darling.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.696
Horst, are you okay?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.739
Never better.

21:22.823 --> 21:26.576
I love you, Mary Ann!

21:26.660 --> 21:28.620
Well, there you have it, folks,

21:28.704 --> 21:30.872
a true happy ending.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.000
King Julien, how does it feel to know

21:33.083 --> 21:36.211
you really did defeat the foosa
without Clover?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.463
Tell you, Xixi, it feels...

21:38.547 --> 21:39.506
Clover?

21:39.589 --> 21:40.882
You okay, Clover?

21:40.966 --> 21:42.467
No. But I will be.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.929
Sorry you went to all the trouble
with training an army, Your Majesty.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.597
Looks like I'm staying.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.976
Clover, I'm glad I found you.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.603
You knew I was coming back
to the kingdom, Sage.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.480
Oh, yeah. Clover, when you left,

21:57.441 --> 22:00.152
I thought butterfly larvae
were fighting in my colon.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.695
Mm, gross.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.572
I know, right?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.656
But they weren't.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.617
The feeling was... something else.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.036
-It was...

22:09.119 --> 22:10.787
...emptiness,

22:10.871 --> 22:13.790
like my heart was being sucked dry

22:13.874 --> 22:17.753
by some giant heart-sucking thing.

22:17.836 --> 22:21.840
And it was making
that horrible sucking sound.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.969
Stop. What are you going on about?

22:26.053 --> 22:27.512
Clover...

22:28.513 --> 22:29.848
-Will you...

22:29.931 --> 22:31.183
...marry me?

22:34.394 --> 22:35.228
Yes!

22:35.312 --> 22:36.897
