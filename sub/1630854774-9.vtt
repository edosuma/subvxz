WEBVTT

00:15.098 --> 00:16.683
Raymond, Paul said he's ready for you.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.976
At long last.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.979
Lisa, let's boogie.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.443
Steven, come on.
We're getting out of here.

00:26.944 --> 00:27.945
What are these for?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.530
Joy.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.268
Fun, right? Come on.

00:59.852 --> 01:00.853
Don't forget Mom.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.814
You sure we should do this today?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.567
It's been long enough.
She wanted you to spread her ashes, right?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.194
I know, but it's a little windy.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.656
- I don't wanna get any of her in my mouth.
- Look, I get it.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.535
It's my dead wife's birthday this week.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.954
I've been stuck too.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.957
I think we should move forward.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.377
It looks closed.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.296
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.593
So, I saw you're getting a fancy award.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.344
- Don't be judgmental...
- Oh, man.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.097
...but I have a Google Alert on you.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.390
That is so lame.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.393
Wow. I just said very clearly,
don't be judgmental.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.604
- Yeah, but I didn't agree to that.
- That's fair.

01:43.604 --> 01:48.483
Yeah, the APA is giving me
a career achievement award.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.651
Congratulations.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.819
Come on, man. It sucks.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.323
Well, is there anything I can do
for you in this challenging time?

01:54.323 --> 01:58.118
No. It's just that I'm not ready
to be put out to pasture.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.914
- Can I say something?
- I feel you talk all the time.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.625
I do. But I'm paying you for it,
so I'm good.

02:05.167 --> 02:08.878
Listen, when I came to see you
over 20 years ago...

02:08.878 --> 02:10.547
Twenty-two years ago.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.966
...I was drinking too much,
and my marriage had ended,

02:12.966 --> 02:16.345
and my self-esteem was so low

02:16.345 --> 02:19.389
that I spent most of my time wondering
how I'm gonna kill myself.

02:20.224 --> 02:23.060
Now, my life is so good that
half the time I come through that door,

02:23.060 --> 02:24.686
I don't know what I want to talk about.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.149
Today I was gonna talk about feeling old

02:29.149 --> 02:32.152
and wondering
if I can still pull off a leather jacket.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.862
- You can't.
- Ouch.

02:35.447 --> 02:39.159
Listen, Paul. You've spent
your whole career helping people.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.037
You deserve to be celebrated for a minute.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.374
Some people might not agree with that.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.167
Yeah, like who?

02:48.335 --> 02:52.047
Okay. Well, just know that I...

02:54.216 --> 02:55.634
am very grateful.

02:57.553 --> 02:58.971
Thank you, Paul.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.059
You're welcome.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.564
Do you think
I could pull off leather pants?

03:09.273 --> 03:11.108
- No.
- What about a bodysuit?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.027
I think your time is up.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.573
Okay, Lisa.
Everybody gets feedback at work, okay?

03:17.573 --> 03:20.492
But you hear criticism at a 10
when it's been given to you at a 2.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.702
You're not wrong.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.998
Hey, you are not your mistakes.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.250
But my boss thinks I'm a idiot now.

03:28.250 --> 03:32.004
That's your mom's voice, not your boss's.
You are not an idiot.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.380
You know how I know that?

03:34.339 --> 03:35.883
It's because you are the shit.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.676
I like when you curse.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.261
That's why I fucking do that shit, bitch.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.724
See, this is why you worth
the 90-minute drive.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.267
'Cause you also the shit.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.437
Lisa, this is not about me.
But please, don't stop.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.898
But goddamn, 90 minutes?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.358
Yeah. It's worth it coming to see
a Black therapist.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.862
I don't have to explain to you
about my mom's narcissism.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.780
Or the fact that it's not codependent

03:58.780 --> 04:01.950
that my whole family goes to the mall
with my cousin when he need a new suit.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.244
Well, we are a communal people.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.370
Thank you.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.332
But seriously,
your family is codependent as hell.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.668
So these were her seats, huh?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.712
Yeah, but it feels weird leaving her here.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.882
If it helps, you can talk to her first.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.425
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.220
- Say all the things you never got to say.
- Everything?

04:21.220 --> 04:26.016
I mean, you can leave out the dream
where she cut off your penis, but yeah.

04:26.016 --> 04:26.975
Yeah.

04:31.396 --> 04:35.067
Mom, sometimes you were horrible.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.111
Like, really fucking mean. And judgmental.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.740
You stole thousands of dollars
from your church.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.450
Did not know that.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.868
But you did raise me.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.538
I love you.

04:47.538 --> 04:48.997
That was beautiful.

04:48.997 --> 04:49.915
- Thanks.
- Mostly.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.460
Should we spread this lady out or what?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.628
Yeah.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.840
Take all the time you need.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.716
Watch my feet though.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.095
<i>Roger that.</i>

05:04.513 --> 05:05.931
I was wrong. We should run.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.475
Right there.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.186
Security. Stop! Hey!

05:13.480 --> 05:16.775
Dump as you go.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.903
Dump and run.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.164
What were you up to?

06:45.864 --> 06:47.574
Hey.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.726
That's all we get.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.021
But it was so fun.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.235
Okay, I love you a lot.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.344
You can't even hear the music.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.889
I know.
I just wanted to be a part of it so bad.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.976
Hey, can my grounding please be over?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.103
- Yes.
- Really?

07:58.103 --> 07:59.188
In two more weeks.

07:59.188 --> 08:02.149
- Okay, that was mean.
- You stole my car, you little fuck.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.108
Fair.

08:03.108 --> 08:06.528
Hey, remember how you used to come lay
on the end of the bed?

08:07.196 --> 08:10.324
You'd tell me and your mom
about some song you were obsessed with.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.868
- We'd have a listening party.
- Yeah.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.037
Then I'd play one of my favorite songs
for you.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.289
You'd tell me
that my taste in music sucked.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.625
Yeah. I miss that.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.044
If it helps,
your taste in music still does suck.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.879
Glad you still think so.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.632
Seriously, what is a Goo Goo Doll?

08:31.887 --> 08:32.888
Okay.

08:32.888 --> 08:36.350
- To Derek. Cheers!
- Thank you.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.894
That is so kind. I appreciate it.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.938
Retired, and with that head of hair?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.065
The world is yours.

08:43.732 --> 08:44.733
Stop.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.903
What are you gonna do?

08:47.903 --> 08:50.822
I don't know. I guess the first year
I'll just chill at home.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.658
That's why I invited you all.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.910
Partly because I'm so happy for you.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.245
I love you so much.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.790
And partly because I don't want
any questions when I take my own life.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.209
That was one hell of a toast.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.335
Thank you.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.920
I have big wedding news.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.380
Are we done celebrating Derek?

09:06.380 --> 09:09.758
It's cool. I might have a big shindig
in a few weeks with friends.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.426
You know, couple hundred people, so...

09:11.426 --> 09:12.678
Are we invited?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.264
You are now.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.807
I'm sorry, a couple hundred people?

09:16.807 --> 09:18.851
Guys, does D-Bone have
a better life than us?

09:18.851 --> 09:22.312
What can I say?
I like people, and people like me.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.814
That's true. It's annoying.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.732
Hey. Hi. I think we moved on to my thing.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.817
- I don't know.
- Sorry.

09:26.817 --> 09:27.901
- Did we?
- No.

09:27.901 --> 09:28.819
I don't think so.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.446
Jimmy has been reinstated.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.449
He is once again performing
my wedding ceremony.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.367
Wow.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.286
Why did you let him back in?

09:37.286 --> 09:39.538
Because I'm a kind and benevolent prince.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.915
- Okay, I don't know if you're a prince.
- No.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.586
I also guilted him
for being a selfish son of a bitch, so...

09:45.586 --> 09:47.421
- Yeah. That's what it is.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.381
I still don't love these two as friends.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.800
- And we don't give a shit.
- It makes us stronger.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.885
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.557
Hey, sorry I'm running late. Let's go.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.475
It's fine. I have to pee actually. Can I--

10:00.475 --> 10:02.686
Gaby, boundaries. You can hold it.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.981
Are you serious? You know how much water
I drink in a day. One second.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.818
- Good morning.
- Oh, damn. Wow.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.904
Wow, that's a good surprised face.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.865
Don't you have to go to the bathroom?

10:14.865 --> 10:16.366
No. I can hold it in for this.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.578
Gaby, this is Dr. Baram.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.497
You've seen me naked.
Go with my first name.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.210
- Julie.
- Hello, Julie. I am Gaby.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.921
Well, I should put some pants on.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.215
But see if you can cheer grumpy up, here.

10:31.215 --> 10:34.134
He's pissed
because he's an award-winning therapist.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.595
Is he gonna win any awards in the bedroom?
Schwing!

10:37.262 --> 10:39.473
Holy shit. I don't wanna know that.
Actually I do.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.725
What? Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.228
When I get nervous,
I start just saying stupid shit.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.438
And that's what's happening right now. Sorry.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.857
Are you gonna take her
to the awards ceremony?

10:48.857 --> 10:50.150
Go to the bathroom.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.404
She's fun.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.781
Isn't she?

10:55.781 --> 10:59.409
Look, the award ceremony is in Vegas,

10:59.409 --> 11:02.079
- and I'm not sure if I'm--
- All right. No, no. Relax.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.413
- If I'm gonna go.
- No.

11:03.413 --> 11:09.378
No, much as I was flattered
by the invitation from your colleague,

11:09.962 --> 11:14.758
I'm just not sure we're at the
sit-together-through-boring-stuff stage.

11:14.758 --> 11:19.221
I have never actually been
at that stage, and I've been married.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.235
I don't know where the bathroom is.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.736
Down the hall, on the left.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.532
- Oh, my God. Look at her legs.
- Not a word.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.284
- Congratulations.
- Go.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.410
Okay, I'm gonna...

11:45.789 --> 11:47.583
But seriously, I'm super happy for you.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.834
This is really inspiring.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.752
I didn't think I'd be able to have sex
when I got old...

11:50.752 --> 11:52.296
- Go.
- ...but I'm gonna fuck forever.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.214
- This is awesome.
- Stop it. Go.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.976
It's nice to have you working here.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.604
The exciting world
of corporate accounting.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.232
- Hope you're having a little fun.
- Are you kidding me, Dad?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.650
I love scanning these documents.

12:13.650 --> 12:17.237
If you let me do this when I was a kid,
I probably never would've played football.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.322
Yeah, okay.

12:20.199 --> 12:21.825
I appreciate the job, Dad. Thank you.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.536
Son.
I'm just glad to see you doing so well.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.249
- Good. Keep it up.
- Yes, sir.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.797
Now that I got a job,
I can finally give you this.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.762
No prouder moment for a therapist
than when his patient pays him rent.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.599
Is there any way you can be happy for me
and still mad at him?

12:45.599 --> 12:48.519
Yeah, I can do that. Good on you, kid.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.689
- What's the matter with you?
- So many things, Paul.

12:54.149 --> 12:58.153
Hey, listen,
I was thinking about your award.

12:58.153 --> 13:01.240
Why is everybody obsessing
about this goddamn award?

13:01.240 --> 13:02.324
What award?

13:02.324 --> 13:04.201
Paul's been nominated for a Grouchy.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.578
They give it to whoever can spend
the most time pissed off

13:06.578 --> 13:07.746
for absolutely no reason.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.540
You got this in the bag, Paul.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.253
All right, look, they give you
these career achievement things

13:14.253 --> 13:16.129
at the last possible moment,

13:16.129 --> 13:20.259
when they still think you can make
a speech and not just stumble up there

13:20.259 --> 13:23.387
and go, "Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah," and shit yourself.

13:23.387 --> 13:26.390
If that happens, standing ovation.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.641
My life is over.

13:28.392 --> 13:31.395
And the cherry on the top is
my daughter thinks I'm a selfish prick.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.399
Look, these things you're talking about,
they're just roadblocks, right?

13:35.399 --> 13:36.984
You gotta blow through 'em.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.320
What if you invited Meg and her family
to Vegas to celebrate with you?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.572
What are you, nuts?

13:41.572 --> 13:45.450
Meg's barely talking to me,
and Mason is ten years old.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.286
What's he gonna do, gamble and whore?

13:47.286 --> 13:49.329
Hey, Vegas is for families now.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.958
So what he's saying is you and your
grandson could gamble and whore together.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.877
He'd never be able to keep up.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.879
I go hard.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.717
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, well, I'm here for one reason only.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.969
Was that me in the painting or what?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.347
- Yeah, it was you.
- What did you say?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.849
It's you.

14:08.849 --> 14:13.270
Thank you. Hearing a man say I'm right
really greases my fucking peach, dude.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.898
I should've said it more often.

14:18.192 --> 14:21.820
Listen, about what I said
at the art gallery, I do regret it.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.113
But I forgave myself.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.658
I went on a whole-ass journey.
It took less than two minutes.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.622
But that show was sick.
And it is nice to see you killing it.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.415
Thanks.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.294
Reminds me of who you were
when we first met.

14:38.504 --> 14:41.006
- Do you think we could ever try again?
- Excuse me?

14:41.006 --> 14:44.426
What? I don't think we ever fell
out of love. I just fucked things up.

14:45.594 --> 14:49.598
I mean, you're still the funniest,
sexiest woman I've ever seen.

14:50.474 --> 14:54.520
Oh, God. I'm so annoyed this is working.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.730
Wanna get out of here?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.403
Wow. Yeah.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.697
Yeah, that'll work for me.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.243
Shit, I can't believe
we're doing this again.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.328
Well, it makes sense, you know?

15:11.328 --> 15:14.331
I mean, once you crack the sex seal,
you're gonna keep doing it.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.458
- Yeah.
- Plus, I'm really good at it...

15:16.458 --> 15:18.877
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- ...since I started Zumba. Yeah.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.088
We're a good fit.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.340
Really? You think, like,
penis-vagina alignment?

15:23.340 --> 15:25.467
I mean, it is-- It's snug down there.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.426
Thank you.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.761
- Well, that's both of us.
- What?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.430
Griffins.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.307
You fucking saved my ass earlier.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.768
I mean, I was this close
to taking Nico to pound town.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.354
I mean, he was talking about
how much he changed for me

15:37.354 --> 15:38.730
and how he's still sober,

15:38.730 --> 15:41.316
and how sexy I was,
which you know I love that.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.485
- You do fucking look sexy.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.112
- Yeah.
- Still, what was I thinking?

15:45.112 --> 15:47.072
I missed out on so much
to get him through rehab.

15:47.072 --> 15:50.617
Like, I passed up a teaching job.
I ditched conferences.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.162
I lost out on so many opportunities
just to make sure he was okay.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.791
So thank you for your safe, safe dick.

15:58.876 --> 15:59.960
Yeah. You're welcome.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.925
He wouldn't like it if I told you, but
my dick doesn't like to be called "safe."

16:07.718 --> 16:10.429
What about, like, maybe "bold"
or "majestic"?

16:10.429 --> 16:12.222
What about "decent"?

16:12.222 --> 16:13.765
"Consistent"?

16:13.765 --> 16:15.017
How about...

16:16.268 --> 16:17.728
"working-class dick"?

16:22.107 --> 16:25.527
- Yeah, he likes it. He likes it.
- Oh, shit. He loves it.

16:25.527 --> 16:29.031
I like that.
I gotta consult with me union.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.287
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.705
Wanna go with me to get the mail?

16:36.705 --> 16:39.875
You want me to walk with you
to the end of the driveway?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.084
And back.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.464
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. Hey, guys.

16:45.464 --> 16:46.548
Kill me.

16:47.299 --> 16:50.135
If Liz said she'd help with your
catering thing, why don't you ask her?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.970
Nah, we were just joking around.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.097
Besides,
I got a new job working with my dad.

16:55.516 --> 16:56.975
How's that going?

16:56.975 --> 16:59.019
I am very grateful for the opportunity.

16:59.728 --> 17:00.729
Oh, damn.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.442
You ever look at this tree?

17:06.234 --> 17:07.819
Her graceful trunk.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.031
Her sturdy limbs.

17:12.241 --> 17:13.575
She's beautiful.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.618
Derek, do you wanna fuck that tree?

17:15.618 --> 17:16.744
I don't think it's legal.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.997
Please tell me
that's not what's stopping you.

17:20.332 --> 17:23.417
Okay. I'm gonna help get Liz on board.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.922
We can get Gaby to help.
Plus, I've got a rock.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.968
I'ma need you to connect some more dots.

17:30.968 --> 17:34.346
Liz gives all her best polished rocks
to the people she loves the most.

17:34.346 --> 17:39.268
She's only given one to me,
Derek and two of her three sons.

17:40.936 --> 17:44.314
So, the ceremony will start,
and then I'll give the opening remarks.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.693
Sure you wanna hear this now?
You don't wanna be surprised?

17:47.693 --> 17:50.112
- Yeah, I'm good not being surprised.
- Okay.

17:50.112 --> 17:53.031
So, I'll be standing right next to you.

17:53.031 --> 17:56.285
Liz is the audience.
Whenever you're ready.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.162
- Are you gonna be this close?
- I'll probably be this close.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.540
Charlie will be right here.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.917
Don't worry about him.
He'll be looking at me.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.460
Okay.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.963
Yes. Up top. You got this, buddy.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.549
- That's Charlie.
- He'll like that.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.551
Just wanna-- Give me a second

18:12.551 --> 18:14.761
- 'cause I worked really hard on this.
- Yeah.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.471
Yes, yes, yes.

18:17.389 --> 18:18.390
Oh, man.

18:18.390 --> 18:21.685
Yeah, this definitely reminds me
of when you married Tia and I.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.604
- Tia and me.
- Nobody cares, Liz.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.939
- No, it's wrong.
- Come on back.

18:27.566 --> 18:28.567
"Marriage."

18:33.780 --> 18:34.781
I need a second.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.993
- Wow.
- This, not good.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.913
No, although now I'm really
looking forward to this wedding.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.749
I just gotta shake it off.
I'm good. Gotta get loose.

18:43.749 --> 18:44.875
Yeah.

18:45.459 --> 18:46.627
In high school basketball,

18:46.627 --> 18:49.171
when someone would talk shit to me,
it would really motivate me.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.590
Will you pretend like you don't think
I'm gonna be able to do this?

18:51.590 --> 18:53.842
Don't have to pretend. This is a disaster.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.552
- Okay, fuck you, Liz.
- Yeah.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.930
You know what?
This time I'm just gonna read it.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.349
- No emotion, just words.
- Yeah, that'll work.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.644
"Marriage"-- Nope.

19:03.644 --> 19:04.728
I'm fucked.

19:04.728 --> 19:05.854
Without a drop of lube.

19:05.854 --> 19:09.233
Liz. Normally funny, not today.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.734
Today it's a little funny.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.904
Not today. Too stressed.
My parents arrived yesterday.

19:13.904 --> 19:16.532
My dad's already asked
if all gay couples kiss at the end

19:16.532 --> 19:17.908
or if some bump fists.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.076
Brian, Brian, calm down.

19:19.076 --> 19:21.703
I freaked out a bit,
but I promise you I'm gonna get there.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.207
Marriage.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.627
- Fuck you, Liz! This isn't about you!
- Man.

19:28.627 --> 19:31.421
This is about Brian
and imaginary Charlie and I.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.507
- Me.
- Liz, don't provoke me!

19:33.507 --> 19:35.050
You're supposed to be the audience.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.345
So unless the audience is
a group of blueberry-eating assholes,

19:38.345 --> 19:39.471
you're not in character.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.431
- Fuck you!
- Take a walk. She's not worth it.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.891
Fuck you, Liz.

19:42.891 --> 19:46.144
You are not gonna ruin the best day
of my life, you grammar witch.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.231
These are good blueberries.

19:49.231 --> 19:52.025
- <i>How you feeling?</i>
- I'm feeling good.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.194
Feeling fine. That's not why I called.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.405
I--

19:57.197 --> 19:58.615
I know it's the worst place in the world,

19:58.615 --> 20:00.742
but what are your feelings
about Las Vegas?

20:01.702 --> 20:06.081
Well, don't judge me,
but I fucking love it.

20:06.665 --> 20:07.916
I do too.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.796
I was wondering if you and Mason and Dave

20:12.796 --> 20:14.590
<i>could join me there this weekend.</i>

20:15.174 --> 20:16.633
- My treat.
- Wow.

20:19.428 --> 20:20.846
Shoot, we can't.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.514
<i>Sorry.</i>

20:22.514 --> 20:24.808
Mason's got a school play this Saturday.

20:26.727 --> 20:29.813
Okay, well,
how about if you could come Sunday?

20:29.813 --> 20:33.483
- I could stay an extra couple days.
- Why does it have to be this weekend?

20:33.483 --> 20:37.362
It's no big deal, but I'm getting this
lifetime achievement thing from the APA--

20:37.362 --> 20:41.158
Right. No, I almost forgot.
Work first, everything else second.

20:41.158 --> 20:43.535
- No. Come on. Let me start over.
- <i>I gotta go, Dad.</i>

20:43.535 --> 20:45.329
- It could be any weekend.
- I gotta go.

20:50.751 --> 20:51.752
Fuck.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.013
You don't know nothing about nothing,
and you give horrible advice.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.390
One of your patients?

21:06.225 --> 21:09.102
No, that's my boss and mentor. Yeah.

21:12.022 --> 21:12.856
Hi, Paul.

21:14.399 --> 21:18.820
Paul, are you in a good enough mood
for me to ask you for an annoying favor?

21:21.573 --> 21:23.158
- No.
- Okay, well, I don't care.

21:23.158 --> 21:24.284
I'm gonna do it anyway.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.915
- I'm applying for a professorship.
- A professorship?

21:31.416 --> 21:34.211
Gaby,
academia is the fifth circle of hell.

21:34.211 --> 21:39.842
It goes babies, musicals,
magic, kale, academia.

21:39.842 --> 21:42.344
Don't come for magic.
You know I went to magic camp, okay?

21:42.344 --> 21:44.346
I can pull shit out of your ears
that would astound you.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.348
- Leave my ears alone.
- Okay.

21:47.516 --> 21:48.433
What do you want?

21:49.017 --> 21:51.186
I was wondering
if you could write me a recommendation.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.480
Why are you chasing a professorship?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.483
Because even with my current patient
roster, I still have the bandwidth.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.901
And we've talked about this.

21:57.901 --> 22:01.154
More teachers that look like me
mean more therapists that look like me.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.657
And I'm not talking about tall
and hot as shit.

22:03.657 --> 22:04.741
I'm talking about--

22:04.741 --> 22:05.826
- Black.
- Exactly.

22:05.826 --> 22:09.413
Plus, with all this safe dick I'm getting,
I got plenty of time.

22:10.539 --> 22:11.456
What is safe dick?

22:11.456 --> 22:14.418
Simple, uncomplicated sex
that doesn't ruin your life.

22:14.418 --> 22:15.377
So, Julie--

22:16.128 --> 22:17.171
Easy.

22:17.754 --> 22:22.926
Even though she is a woman,
could be thought of as "safe dick"?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.094
Sure.

22:24.094 --> 22:25.179
Cool.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.267
Write whatever recommendation you want,
and I'll sign it.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.395
Are you sure I'm not putting you out?
I could sign it for you too.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.479
Awesome.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.861
- Isn't this place great?
- Very nice.

22:40.861 --> 22:43.155
It's a small wedding,
so we're only gonna spend a million.

22:43.822 --> 22:46.158
- Really?
- He doesn't always get sarcasm.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.620
Brian says that about anyone
who doesn't like his jokes.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.379
- There's the wedding planner.
- Hey.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.881
- Be back in a sec.
- Okay.

23:02.716 --> 23:03.717
I like him.

23:04.218 --> 23:05.219
Me too.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.639
I'm really glad you're here.

23:08.639 --> 23:10.015
I wouldn't miss it.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.561
So are you gonna go with
the classic tuxedo look?

23:15.646 --> 23:18.524
A classic tuxedo
will be one of my outfits, yes.

23:19.316 --> 23:20.901
There'll be costume changes?

23:20.901 --> 23:23.028
Yeah, just like my 16th birthday.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.614
So, hey, been meaning to ask you...

23:27.366 --> 23:31.078
Jimmy was supposed to be my best man,
but now he's performing the ceremony,

23:31.078 --> 23:32.162
and...

23:34.581 --> 23:36.166
I was hoping you'd stand up there with me.

23:39.461 --> 23:42.256
Well, that's nice of you to ask, Brian.

23:43.257 --> 23:44.258
But, you know, I'd--

23:45.843 --> 23:48.011
I'd be happier just sitting with your mom.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.265
Course. Yeah. No problem.

24:02.526 --> 24:05.487
Being grounded sucks,
but he's been around.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.282
You know, checking my homework,
making dinner.

24:08.282 --> 24:09.366
Total dad mode.

24:09.992 --> 24:12.244
- And that's good, right?
- Yeah.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.290
Give me my hat back.

24:16.290 --> 24:18.625
You told me to wear it
'cause it's hot and sunny.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.918
But now I'm hot.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.212
Okay, damn.

24:22.212 --> 24:23.213
Hey.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.174
- Hey.
- Am I interrupting?

24:25.174 --> 24:27.301
- We just finished.
- Okay, cool.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.844
Am I allowed to make fun of the hat?

24:29.761 --> 24:30.679
I wouldn't.

24:30.679 --> 24:33.056
You want a lift?
I'm gonna visit Mom, if you wanna come.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.976
No, I biked.
Plus, I have to help Sean with something.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.144
- Yeah.
- You good?

24:37.144 --> 24:38.228
So good.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.313
Okay.

24:40.439 --> 24:42.482
Paul, before you get back
to that newsroom from the '40s--

24:43.066 --> 24:45.110
Sorry, you always call me on my shit.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.780
I think it's time for me
to return the favor.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.741
- Think I'll pass.
- You don't get to pass.

24:50.741 --> 24:52.075
Oh, damn.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.412
Look, you invited Meg to Vegas.
You got burned. It sucks.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.497
But you know what?
At least you let her know how you feel.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.916
And you gotta keep doing that.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.000
He's right.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.585
Who asked you? Or you?

25:02.336 --> 25:05.130
The weekend with Meg fell apart
'cause of the award thing.

25:05.130 --> 25:09.176
But they can just mail me
the stupid thing.

25:09.176 --> 25:12.888
Jesus, now you're not gonna go?
You're being honored, Paul.

25:12.888 --> 25:14.431
Come on. I'll go with you.

25:14.431 --> 25:16.099
That's not exactly a selling point.

25:17.226 --> 25:21.605
What about this doctor
that you're having S-E-X with?

25:22.147 --> 25:26.193
You're sleeping with your doctor?
Oh, my God. Is she cute? Do you like her?

25:26.193 --> 25:27.569
Gaby says that he does.

25:27.569 --> 25:32.032
Gaby also says,
and I quote, "Her legs are insane!"

25:32.032 --> 25:34.368
- Okay.
- Fucking Gaby.

25:34.368 --> 25:36.078
You like her, Paul. Ask her.

25:36.078 --> 25:38.330
Why is it so hard
for you to be vulnerable?

25:38.330 --> 25:40.541
This whole Fortress of Solitude thing,

25:42.000 --> 25:42.876
it's getting old.

25:43.585 --> 25:47.130
Sometimes you gotta put yourself
out there. Make a big gesture.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.258
People love a big gesture.

25:49.258 --> 25:51.134
Huge gesture.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.972
- Are you done?
- Only if you're gonna listen to me.

25:54.972 --> 25:57.307
Then we're in a tricky spot.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.101
You know I'm right.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.438
It felt fucking good to say that to you.

26:03.438 --> 26:05.816
Hey, I love you both.

26:05.816 --> 26:06.900
Bye.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.321
Come on.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.490
I told you he's doing better.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.244
It's fucking annoying.

26:23.166 --> 26:27.754
So, I see you are serious
about White Guilt Catering.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.674
I'm not sure I settled on the name,
but yeah.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.426
I need investors,
and you said you were in.

26:32.426 --> 26:35.429
We were kidding around,
and now you're pretending we weren't?

26:35.429 --> 26:38.223
I was, but now I'm getting kinda scared.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.434
Hey, you're okay.

26:40.434 --> 26:41.894
- You're in on this?
- Yeah.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.937
I love to support small Black businesses.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.647
What businesses do you support?

26:45.647 --> 26:47.107
I am a Black business.

26:47.733 --> 26:49.943
It's a lot of money.
I would have to talk to Derek.

26:49.943 --> 26:51.862
- Everyone, calm down.
- Okay, copy that.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.822
Hey, D-Train.

26:55.490 --> 26:56.491
What up, G-Spot?

26:56.491 --> 26:59.036
You cool if Liz gave 20 grand
to Sean's new catering business?

27:00.412 --> 27:01.413
Sure.

27:02.122 --> 27:05.584
Took a while for him to come around,
but he did. You in?

27:06.084 --> 27:09.254
I don't know. I'm super busy right now.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.590
Liz, remember when you gave this to me?

27:11.590 --> 27:13.300
You're invoking the rock?

27:14.510 --> 27:15.802
That's a pretty-ass rock.

27:16.553 --> 27:19.348
- I want one.
- No, you haven't earned it, "G-Spot."

27:20.516 --> 27:22.309
You gave it to me when Mom died,

27:22.309 --> 27:25.646
and you said that it meant
that you love me

27:25.646 --> 27:27.189
and that you'd always have my back.

27:27.189 --> 27:30.651
And this last year, you've shown up for me
over and over again,

27:31.318 --> 27:34.071
and I'm so grateful, so thank you.

27:34.696 --> 27:35.697
You're welcome.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.616
And maybe it's unfair to ask,

27:37.616 --> 27:39.701
but I was wondering if you could
show up for me one more time

27:39.701 --> 27:41.119
and help out with Sean.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.332
That is the most manipulative
you've ever been.

27:45.332 --> 27:46.834
Yeah, that was good shit.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.461
So?

27:51.255 --> 27:52.256
Let's do it.

27:52.256 --> 27:54.633
- Yes!
- Yay!

27:54.633 --> 27:55.926
- All right.
- There it is.

27:57.177 --> 28:00.973
You know what? I could help
with marketing, PR. I'm great at merch.

28:00.973 --> 28:03.100
That's the best part.
You don't need to get involved.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.601
I'll take care of everything.

28:06.395 --> 28:08.564
- Cool.
- Thank you.

28:08.564 --> 28:09.815
Good job.

28:09.815 --> 28:11.733
- You're the best. Thank you.
- You rock, Liz.

28:15.863 --> 28:18.073
Hey. Come here.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.661
You get your little feelings hurt? Sorry.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.666
- Let me get one of those rocks.
- No.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.001
Come on. Don't be like that.

28:29.001 --> 28:30.586
No, you played me today.

28:43.182 --> 28:45.392
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:46.643 --> 28:49.605
Would you like to go away
with me for the weekend?

28:50.189 --> 28:51.023
When?

28:52.649 --> 28:53.859
Now.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.238
You know
you're a ridiculous person, right?

28:59.865 --> 29:00.866
Yeah.

29:06.121 --> 29:08.624
Okay. If anyone asks,
you invited me a week ago,

29:08.624 --> 29:11.585
and I deliberated a great deal.

29:11.585 --> 29:12.669
Okay.

29:12.669 --> 29:15.380
- Give me five minutes.
- You got it.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.306
You still got it, man.

29:31.522 --> 29:32.523
Hey, you.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.442
Okay.

29:36.443 --> 29:39.780
- Oh, my God. They're beautiful.
- Yeah?

29:39.780 --> 29:42.616
I had to make up
for last year's birthday debacle.

29:42.616 --> 29:45.619
I really did think
we'd both love a gigantic television.

29:45.619 --> 29:49.164
Anyways, happy birthday. I love you.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.272
Let me fix you.

30:13.939 --> 30:15.858
- We're late.
- No, it's gonna be perfect.

30:15.858 --> 30:17.442
You know what you're going to say?

30:18.777 --> 30:20.028
I'll just wing it.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.259
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.053
Are these seats taken?

30:46.722 --> 30:47.973
Dad, what are you doing here?

30:47.973 --> 30:49.850
Vegas is too hot.

30:50.601 --> 30:53.270
Besides, I love fourth-grade musicals.

30:54.813 --> 30:56.398
- Dave.
- Paul.

31:06.992 --> 31:08.368
So which one is yours?

31:08.368 --> 31:10.204
I think it's the big gray mouse.

31:11.121 --> 31:13.457
- It's an elephant, Dad.
- It's an elephant?

31:13.457 --> 31:16.627
- The big gray mouse that's an elephant.
- Good-looking elephant.

31:16.627 --> 31:18.212
Yeah, he's a good-looking boy.

31:18.212 --> 31:20.589
Behold, the mighty jungle.

31:25.677 --> 31:26.970
I knew you liked her.

31:27.554 --> 31:28.847
She's not with me.

32:13.392 --> 32:14.351
You're up!

32:14.351 --> 32:17.104
Good. Okay, hi. I wanna show you a song.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.481
Holy shit. Listening parties are back.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.609
Okay, this is gonna put you
in a good mood immediately.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.694
Okay.

32:31.785 --> 32:33.579
Okay. I get the appeal.

32:40.586 --> 32:42.754
- Don't ruin it for me.
- Okay. All right.

32:42.754 --> 32:43.839
Okay. Thank you.

32:45.132 --> 32:47.593
We play this on the bus
on the way to away games.

32:47.593 --> 32:52.347
Oh, my God. Summer gets so hyped,
she crushed a Gatorade bottle on her head.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.349
Oh, my God. That is so Summer.

32:54.892 --> 32:56.101
- So Summer.
- Tell her to never change.

33:12.242 --> 33:16.663
- Hey, when is your next game?
- I think next Tuesday. Let's see.

33:21.585 --> 33:22.586
Oh, shit.

33:24.713 --> 33:26.089
We forgot Mom's birthday.

33:30.719 --> 33:31.803
No, I--

33:35.432 --> 33:36.725
Oh, my God.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.644
You asked me
if I wanted to visit her yesterday.

33:39.853 --> 33:41.063
I did.

33:42.481 --> 33:43.982
We didn't forget. I forgot.

33:43.982 --> 33:47.903
I forgot. Fuck!
Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell me?

33:47.903 --> 33:50.864
I thought that maybe you knew,
and you just wanted some space.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.742
- Shit! I'm such a piece of shit.
- No.

33:53.742 --> 33:55.494
- No, sweetie.
- What's wrong with me?

33:55.494 --> 33:57.079
How did I forget? I forgot--

33:57.663 --> 33:59.122
It was a mistake.

34:00.374 --> 34:01.333
Honey, look at me.

34:03.293 --> 34:04.503
It's okay.

34:05.087 --> 34:06.088
No, it's not.

34:07.089 --> 34:08.297
Alice.
