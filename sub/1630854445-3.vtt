WEBVTT

00:40.123 --> 00:42.709
Is this happening inside my brain?
I mean, you can hear that, right?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.085
Oh, yeah, I can hear it.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.130
Like, jeez, what sadist
put this playlist together?

00:47.213 --> 00:50.300
Right? It's not the most comforting
before a CT scan.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.888
Has Ben called back?

00:54.971 --> 00:56.806
Oh, I-I didn't leave him a message.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.059
-What? Why?
-What was I supposed to say to him?

00:59.142 --> 01:01.186
"I'm sorry my son
sweetly gave you the bird

01:01.269 --> 01:02.687
that I used to kill your brother"?

01:02.771 --> 01:04.981
Hmm. It was sweet of him.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.234
I mean, if anybody has to have the bird,
at least it's Ben?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.695
Well, rather nobody have the bird, but…

01:10.779 --> 01:14.199
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get it back. I have faith.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.367
-Well, that must be nice.
-Mm-hmm.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.744
-You know what we should do?
-Hmm?

01:17.827 --> 01:19.788
-We should visualize it. Yep.
-Oh, boy. Here we go.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.248
-Here we go. I'm serious. Come here.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.374
I want you to feel it.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.669
Okay, feel it for real.
In the palm of your hand, okay?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.215
Feel the relief that you're gonna feel
when it comes back to you.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.342
Hmm. You realize
that if everyone sat around

01:32.425 --> 01:35.386
just hoping that shit would happen,
that, like, nothing would ever happen.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.471
Hmm.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.680
Norman Benson?

01:37.764 --> 01:40.308
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We were here before that guy.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.102
It's fine. I'm not in a rush.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.860
It's hot, right? It's like steamy in here.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.195
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-What?

01:52.278 --> 01:53.905
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.992
All right? And if, for some stupid reason,

01:58.076 --> 02:00.703
it turns out to be something,
then you got it early.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.541
-And that's good.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.669
-What?
-Nothing.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.295
-Don't.
-I…

02:12.382 --> 02:15.343
Okay, remember when I thought
I was pregnant last year?

02:15.426 --> 02:17.929
-Mm-hmm.
-I had an abnormal pap.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.180
You never told me that.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.307
I'm telling you now.
They told me I should follow up.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.350
-And?
-I didn't.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.726
What? Jesus, Judy!

02:24.561 --> 02:27.814
You <i>have </i>to follow up.
That's why they call them follow-ups!

02:27.897 --> 02:29.065
I'm following up now.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.151
Yeah, that was over a year ago, Judy.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.610
Well, I know, but I'm sorry.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.737
-I think I've had kind of a busy year.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.614
-Doing what?
-Oh, I don't know.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.075
Maybe helping you bury my ex-fiance's body

02:39.159 --> 02:42.537
and then planning the vigil
and covering the whole fucking thing up.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.582
So you're saying this is--
this is my fault?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.750
-What?
-I--

02:47.834 --> 02:49.127
Oh, my God, no.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.879
I'm--

02:51.588 --> 02:53.173
Look, we're in this together.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.925
It's just the whole thing
kinda pulled focus from my

02:56.926 --> 02:58.136
vaginal wellness.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.221
-Vaginal? Why?
-Deborah Simpson?

03:00.305 --> 03:03.266
-Hmm? Oh! Did you say Judy Hale?
-Uh, no.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.643
Yeah, you know why?
We've been here for over 45 minutes,

03:05.727 --> 03:08.104
and I think that my friend
might have been skipped over.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.814
-Jen, it's fine.
-No, it's not fine!

03:09.898 --> 03:11.107
You have waited long enough.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.985
So, there must be some sort of mistake.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.778
-There's no mistake, ma'am.
-Really?

03:15.862 --> 03:16.946
Hm.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.283
You're "ma'am"-ing me?
Did you make this playlist, Susan?

03:20.366 --> 03:21.993
-I did, actually. I--
-Mm-hmm.

03:22.076 --> 03:25.205
-We'll wait. Thank you so much, Susan.
-Thank you so much, Susan.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.960
-It's Perez.
-Sorry. No phone calls, ma'am.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.090
Shit, she needs to talk.
She says it's an emergency.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.467
-Okay, let's go.
-No, no!

03:37.550 --> 03:39.427
-She said it's an emergency.
-Jesus, Judy.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.512
This is a fucking emergency, okay?

03:41.596 --> 03:44.766
Now you please just take care of you,
and I will take care of this.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.282
Benji, have you seen my glasses?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.535
-You're holding them, Mom.
-Oh, there they are.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.205
But, what, uh…
Where do we keep the aspirin?

04:07.830 --> 04:10.833
In the top drawer of the marble vanity
in the gold bathroom.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.461
-How could I forget?
-Hmm.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.959
Surprise, surprise. Now you think
you can drive, you fucking loser?

04:53.042 --> 04:55.044
-You wanna know why I drink?
-Why?

04:55.128 --> 04:58.381
Because every time I look in the mirror,
I see the person I hate most,

04:58.464 --> 04:59.382
you fucking bully.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.218
-Fine, go kill somebody. See if I care.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.064
-What you hiding there?
-Huh? Oh.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.610
It's my dad's…
uh, old hunk of junk.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.030
He didn't like looking at it,
so I was just covering it.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.741
It's all rusted out. It's all rusted.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.701
Rusted Root.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.953
-Remember that band Rusted Root?
-Nope.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.371
It's a…

05:30.455 --> 05:33.374
They had a terrific… rhythm section.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.587
What can
I help with, officer?

05:38.296 --> 05:41.591
You left this at The Sawmill last night.
Yeah.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.302
-Oh.
-I saw you knocking back a few at the bar.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.930
Yeah, yeah. Oh, my God. Thank you.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.059
-It was broken when I found it.
-Yeah, no. I know. It was… Yeah.

05:51.142 --> 05:54.228
I just forgot where I put it.

05:55.063 --> 05:55.980
Thank you.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.150
The way you stumbled out of the bar,
looked like you might not remember it.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.777
Not that I'm judging.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.070
Hey, no, judge away.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.906
I've been in a shame spiral
all morning.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.076
My whole life,
uh, if I'm perfectly honest.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.412
Yeah, I'm familiar.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.874
I nearly drank myself
out of a job last year.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.001
-Oh.
-Yeah. Just got my six-month chip.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.753
-Oh, that's great. That's great.
-Thanks.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.339
That's awesome. Yeah.
No, I've-- I've had one of those.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.383
Three times.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.968
We go way AA back. Sorry.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.221
-Trying that one out. Didn't really work.
-No.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.224
-Yeah, it was nice. It was… it was…
-Right. I get it. I get it.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.143
Hey, uh, if you ever
wanna try more out.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.562
I don't know. Just if you wanna go
to a meeting or something.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.856
You know where to find me.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.442
Oh, I do now.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.946
Thank you, Officer Prager.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.781
-Nick.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.574
-Ben.
-Yeah.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.077
Hey, um,

06:52.870 --> 06:54.455
I'm really sorry about your brother.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.375
Oh. Oh, thank you.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.378
Yeah. Yeah, I re-- I really wish
I could help with the case,

07:00.461 --> 07:04.841
but, uh, they got me on this, uh,
hit-and-run Judy Hale was involved in.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.886
-Oh, are you? Oh, good.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.013
That's good. That's good.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.141
-Uh, I mean, it's not good. It's terrible.
-Yeah.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.725
It's an awful thing for somebody to--

07:14.809 --> 07:17.895
-The worst.
-You have any leads yet or…

07:18.479 --> 07:19.355
Not yet.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.525
No car, no crime.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.070
Right.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.531
-Well, we'll get him. Or her.
-Right.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.075
-Yeah, anyway. Uh, yeah.
-Hey.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.827
-Take care of yourself.
-You too.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.917
Do you remember when
I said I hate surprises? Well, surprise.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.211
The FBI found this lodged
in Steve Wood's skull,

07:42.295 --> 07:43.713
whatever the hell that is.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.423
Um…

07:45.506 --> 07:46.799
…it's a-- it's a bird's tail.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.926
Bup-bup! Stop!
Don't. I don't wanna hear it.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.470
The less I know, the better.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.931
-What do you mean a bird's tail?
-It's from a wooden bird Judy had--

07:54.015 --> 07:57.059
Stop, stop! Stop.
Don't. I don't wanna hear anymore.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.520
I'm assuming
you got rid of the rest of it?

07:59.604 --> 08:04.734
No, I do not currently have it
in my possession. That is correct.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.320
-I don't like how you just answered that.
-Yeah.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.865
You know, it's a funny story,
but there are no jokes.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.951
-Well, get it back and get rid of it now.
-Okay, I will. I will.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.329
-You better. Okay, you better.
-I was-- I am! I am!

08:16.412 --> 08:19.582
Because the FBI agent they've got
on this thing, Moranis, he's good.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.834
He won the Meritorious
Medal of Honor last year.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.544
The Merit-- Meritori--

08:23.628 --> 08:26.088
-Am I supposed to know what--
-He's the MVP of the FBI.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.174
Better believe
he's gonna get to the bottom of this.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.927
Okay, maybe just
don't wave it around like that.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.720
But I mean, out of context,

08:32.803 --> 08:36.516
I mean, seriously,
who's gonna guess what that is, you know?

08:36.599 --> 08:40.728
-Was that car here before? That sedan?
-Why, do you think someone's following us?

08:40.811 --> 08:43.272
-Do <i>you</i> think we're being followed?
-I don't know. I don't know.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.607
That's-- that's a lot of Tums.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.943
Well, I'm riddled with ulcers,
thanks to you.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.529
It takes a little while
for ulcers to form over time.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.365
-I'm sorry that you're going through that.
-No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.660
I'm sorry I let myself
get dragged into your mess.

08:55.743 --> 08:59.372
I always thought Judy Hale
was the riptide. You are the riptide.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.083
You know, okay,
I'm-- I'm gonna take care of it.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.292
All right? I promise.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.421
You just… just visualize that

09:08.798 --> 09:10.508
I'm saying to you that it's gone.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.928
-What?
-I-I don't know. It's stupid, okay?

09:14.011 --> 09:15.471
Just can I have one of those, please?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.431
-Thank you.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.811
You know you're not fooling anyone
with that hat. Just like your hair is--

09:21.894 --> 09:23.729
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

09:23.813 --> 09:26.023
-I'm just saying.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.402
If you had put it back in a scrunchie…

09:31.946 --> 09:33.406
Shit.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.980
Judy Hale?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.778
All right, just hold tight.
Almost finished.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.330
Okay. All done.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.457
-That's it?
-Yeah.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.417
-I can… Can I sit up?
-Yeah, you can sit up.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.669
-All right. All set.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.215
I love your necklace. Is that an evil eye?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.718
It is. It's supposed
to ward off anything bad.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.222
Ah, yeah.
This girl could use some warding off.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.892
Yeah. Can't hurt, right?

10:43.434 --> 10:46.687
Did that evil eye see
anything, um, good in there?

10:46.771 --> 10:49.065
Sorry. You know I can't tell you anything.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.358
It's worth a shot.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.485
The doctor will call
with results by end of the day.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.444
Oh, is that, like,

10:53.527 --> 10:56.197
the end of the business day
or, like, the lunar day?

10:56.280 --> 10:57.448
I know it's hard to wait.

10:58.449 --> 11:02.703
They sell these
at that little jewelry store downstairs.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.455
-If you want one.
-Oh.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.916
-Thanks for the info.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.596
-Hey.
-Hey, how'd it go? You get the results?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.556
I have to wait
until the end of the day.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.849
Oh, Jesus.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.601
I know. How'd it go with Perez?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.103
Uh, well, she has ulcers,

11:27.186 --> 11:29.146
and, uh, she thinks
someone's following her.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.233
-Why would someone be following her?
-Nobody's following her.

11:32.316 --> 11:35.736
But the bigger headline
is that they may have found

11:35.820 --> 11:38.572
a little piece of bird in Steve's head.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.824
Oh, God.

11:39.907 --> 11:44.120
And evidently, the FBI has a genius
named Moron who's gonna figure it out.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.164
-Moranis?
-Yeah, but why do you know that?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.542
Remember when I told you
I was cooperating with the FBI?

11:49.625 --> 11:52.545
It was about the Greeks
and the laundering of the money and Steve?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.714
No, no. Yes, of course I do.

11:54.797 --> 11:58.551
Okay. Well, that's who I was talking to.
Glenn is a really nice guy.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.136
Oh, Glenn's a nice guy.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.096
He is.
This is a good thing. I'm telling you.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.390
You know, your ability to be positive

12:04.473 --> 12:07.184
in the shittiest of times
is truly a wonder.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.728
Miracles happen every day.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.105
Well, we could all use
a few of those right now.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.040
Oh, uh, hi, Eileen.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.292
Hello, Jen.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.586
To what do I owe the pleasure?

12:33.669 --> 12:36.714
Oh, well, I heard about Steve.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.508
And I'm… so sorry.

12:40.509 --> 12:43.053
I'm truly, truly sorry.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.181
Thank you, dear.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.018
Um, I brought you ice cream.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.563
It's, uh, rum raisin.
Ben said it's-- it's your favorite, right?

12:52.646 --> 12:55.775
-Uh, is he here?
-Sorry. He-- he's out right now.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.278
Oh, okay. Do you know when he'll be back,

13:00.154 --> 13:02.114
or if he went somewhere close by?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.533
I don't know,
but would you like to come in?

13:05.534 --> 13:09.538
You know what they say.
It's bad manners to eat ice cream alone.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.333
Oh, do they say that?

13:12.416 --> 13:15.836
You caught me in a lie,
but I could certainly use the company.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.797
Okay.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.571
-Make yourself at home.
-Okay.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.115
-I'll grab the ice cream china.
-Oh, thanks.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.558
He jumped in front of our car.
He wanted to get hit.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.937
-It's like he's here with us.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.814
Jesus Christ.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.608
Which one do you think
Steven would want to be buried in?

14:19.692 --> 14:23.279
Oh, yeah, I-I don't think
I'm really the one to ask.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.948
Hmm. It's so important
to pick the right one.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.450
It's the last thing he'll ever wear.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.787
Well, I'm sure whatever one
you pick will be perfect.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.417
I've been so worried about dressing him,

14:36.500 --> 14:38.127
barely dressed myself.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.171
Oh, no.
No, this is a really nice housecoat.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.966
Now I've caught you in a lie.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.218
Look, I…

14:46.886 --> 14:50.973
After my husband died,
I… I didn't get dressed for weeks,

14:51.557 --> 14:56.896
and I-I couldn't shower,
and-- and it got, um, funky.

14:57.855 --> 15:02.484
But at some point,
I had to pick myself up for my kids,

15:03.152 --> 15:06.071
and you still have Ben, you know?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.073
Of course, it's just I…

15:08.616 --> 15:11.035
I just can't help but feel
that it's my fault

15:11.118 --> 15:12.828
that Steven's gone. I mean--

15:13.537 --> 15:14.413
Like, I--

15:14.955 --> 15:18.375
I could have done something,
uh, could have saved him.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.171
I'm his mother. You understand?

15:23.714 --> 15:26.967
Yeah. I do. I do,
but you-- you couldn't have.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.636
Believe me.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.098
Please, please don't blame yourself.
You don't deserve that.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.310
Thank you, dear. You're so kind.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.438
We better dig in before it turns to soup.

15:39.521 --> 15:43.567
I-I actually can't.
I have to go pick up my son from church.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.153
I didn't realize
you were a woman of faith.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.531
Oh, no, no. <i>Definitely</i> not.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.991
I struggle too,

15:51.075 --> 15:55.371
but turning to a higher power
is the only thing that seems

15:55.454 --> 15:58.123
to really help when all else is lost.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.668
Well, then I'm-- I'm glad you have that.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.252
I'm glad we both do.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.463
Hmm.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.929
Uh, coming.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.642
Judy. It's been a minute.

16:16.725 --> 16:17.643
Hey, Glenn.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.311
It's good to see you again. Please.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.397
-You look nice.
-Well, thank you.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.985
Thanks so much
for letting me just come over like this.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.654
-Of course. Uh, please have a seat.
-Thanks.

16:28.737 --> 16:32.616
-Uh-- oh, uh, pistachio?
-No, I just ate.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.619
-How are ya?

16:35.703 --> 16:36.787
How's your wife?

16:37.287 --> 16:38.956
She's good, I hear.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.749
Marcy and I separated.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.334
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.377
It's all right.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.673
I adopted a dog, so… silver linings.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.593
But what's going on?
You sounded worried on the phone.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.014
I think someone might be following me.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.974
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.642
I mean, maybe I'm just being paranoid.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.686
-Maybe you should be.
-Why do you say that?

17:00.769 --> 17:03.105
-Because you just said that.
-I did just say that.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.275
I just think you should follow up on it.
You know, before it's too late.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.192
All right.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.738
-Well, what did this person look like?
-What person?

17:10.821 --> 17:12.573
The person you're paranoid
is following you.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.657
Oh, that person.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.908
Um, I don't know.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.994
-I didn't get a good look.
-Oh.

17:17.077 --> 17:20.205
I don't know if you heard, but my friend
Jen and I, we got into a hit-and-run.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.082
-I hadn't.
-Yeah.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.209
-When did this happen?
-Right after they found Steve.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.503
And one of the cops thinks
that maybe it's all connected.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.838
Like, whoever killed Steve…

17:27.921 --> 17:31.633
I'm so sorry about what happened to him.
That wasn't the outcome any of us wanted.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.676
I know.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.304
-I blame myself, in a way.
-You do?

17:35.387 --> 17:38.307
Not really.
But we should've kept a closer eye on him.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.267
Oh, Glenn, if anyone's to blame, it's me.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.519
Why do you say that?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.563
Because I'm the one that turned him in.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.023
Well, you did the right thing.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.859
I don't think the Greeks would agree.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.695
-You think the Greeks killed Steve?
-I don't know.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.657
Now that you say it out loud, though,
it sounds right.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.620
Assuming it was Constantine's guys,
why would they come after you?

17:59.703 --> 18:01.038
No idea.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.249
I mean, Steve did steal
millions of dollars from them, but--

18:04.333 --> 18:05.876
-Did he?
-Yeah, didn't I tell you that?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.252
-Did you?
-Didn't I?

18:07.836 --> 18:09.963
Anyway, maybe they think I have it.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.050
-Do you?
-Do I?

18:13.133 --> 18:15.344
Oh, my God, can you imagine?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.022
I called every body shop within 20 miles.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.608
So nothing that matches the damage
to Hale and Harding's car.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.318
Well, canvass the neighborhood again.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.697
Is that Wood's autopsy report?
From the FBI?

18:35.781 --> 18:39.701
Yes, it is. I offered to liaise.
To be the Laguna liaison.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.745
-Aww, cool.
-Okay.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.332
-Oh, what the hell is that?
-I don't know. Nobody knows.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.876
It's a piece of wood,
and it was found in his head.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.921
But, you know, out of context,
it can look like anything.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.840
-Wait.
-I don't know what--

18:52.923 --> 18:56.301
So, the killer wedged wood
into Wood's skull.

18:56.385 --> 19:00.389
Hmm. Better light the Bat-Signal.
Looks like the Riddler's at it again.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.308
Uh-huh.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.936
'Cause the Riddler
leaves clever clues like…

19:06.019 --> 19:08.438
Yeah, I-I get it.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.899
You know, that doesn't
really look like the Greeks' style.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.569
-Maybe they changed their style.
-Or maybe it was somebody else.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.570
Maybe.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.239
-I mean, because Wood was kind of a prick.
-Big prick.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.158
-You know, may he rest in peace.
-Mmm.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.618
But you know, his brother--
his brother seems like a…

19:22.202 --> 19:23.537
a really good dude.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.206
Poor guy. He's having a tough time.
I really feel for him.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.375
Yeah, well, don't make it personal.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.545
You're not his friend.
You're a cop. Just don't forget that.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.546
I won't.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.175
Hey, uh, you mind
if I take a look at that thing?

19:36.258 --> 19:38.677
I-- no, I don't mind.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.304
Why would I mind? Who would mind?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.681
Why would that--
that's not even a question.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.894
Minding. I mean, good luck
making any sense of it.

20:04.786 --> 20:05.954
No way.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.875
I think I know
exactly what you're looking for.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.588
Yes, this is it. Thank you.

20:31.855 --> 20:32.856
Just a minute.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.200
Hi, Ben.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.243
Hey, Jude.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.244
Come on in.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.832
It's so weird.
I was just thinking about you.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.835
Oh, yeah? Oh, wow.
I was just thinking about you.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.545
Oh, well, maybe we manifested each other.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.006
Yeah, yeah.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.133
Um,

21:00.217 --> 21:02.261
I had a question for you, uh,

21:03.637 --> 21:04.721
about this.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.516
Okay.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.977
Henry said that you made it for him?

21:10.060 --> 21:11.770
I did, yeah. That was me.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.232
Well, I don't know
what happened to the tail.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.483
Me neither.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.570
Okay. Well, I wanna know…

21:22.531 --> 21:25.409
Will-- will you help me fix it?

21:25.492 --> 21:27.160
-Yes!
-Really?

21:27.244 --> 21:30.289
Yes, of course I will. Wow. Yes.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.250
I just want to bring it back in one piece.
He was sweet to lend it to me.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.544
It's so sweet of you to want to fix it.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.130
Well, I wanna fix it,
but old meat paws here

21:38.213 --> 21:39.798
can't do a craft to save his life,

21:39.881 --> 21:42.217
so I'd really appreciate the help
if you have time.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.803
No, I'm free all day.
I mean, well, the lunar day.

21:44.886 --> 21:48.390
Ah! Awesome. Well,
I-I bought a whole bunch of new ones…

21:50.559 --> 21:52.227
for you to replace the tail with.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.438
-That's a lot of birds.
-Right?

21:56.398 --> 21:57.274
Hey, um,

21:58.692 --> 22:01.695
how's, uh,
how's Jen doing since the accident?

22:02.237 --> 22:05.824
Uh, she's--
you know, it's a stressful time.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.619
Sure. Sure.
No, um… Like, I can't imagine.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.039
All the stuff she's had to deal with.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.083
It's like, how much
can one person handle, you know?

22:43.945 --> 22:44.988
Hey.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.367
-I'm dying.
-What?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.619
Alan thinks we rushed things.
He wants space.

22:50.702 --> 22:51.870
Oh.

22:51.953 --> 22:54.414
So he's getting
an apartment in Newport.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.583
-I'm sorry, honey.
-And he took Adele.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.501
Oh.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.587
Now I'm just rattling around
in that empty house,

23:00.670 --> 23:03.256
like a gloomy but very in-shape ghost.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.176
-I've been wearing my knees out at night.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.428
-Hmm?
-Praying that he'll change his mind.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.556
Oh, I was thinking something so different.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.933
-Hey, Jen.
-Hmm.

23:13.016 --> 23:15.394
Just wanted to sign you up
for Paper Cranes For Christ.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.686
-What now?
-Jana, we're talking.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.730
Uh, just asking all the Harmommies

23:18.814 --> 23:22.109
to make a thousand origami cranes
for the Wing and a Prayer Fundraiser.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.568
If I say yes, will you go away?

23:25.070 --> 23:26.613
-Sure.
-Then yes.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.240
-Thanks.
-Gotta go.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.158
-Go, go, go, go, go, go.
-Okay.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.245
-Are you okay?
-Hmm?

23:33.328 --> 23:36.039
You realize you just signed up
to make 1,000 paper cranes?

23:36.123 --> 23:40.544
Yeah, well, I need
all the goodwill I can get right now.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.129
-You're scaring me.
-Hmm?

23:42.212 --> 23:45.674
No, it's just--
I just got things going on.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.386
Judy has some medical stuff.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.096
What? Is she okay?

23:52.597 --> 23:53.598
I hope so.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.603
Well, I'm here
if you need anything. 

23:59.438 --> 24:00.647
And so is God.

24:00.730 --> 24:01.648
Gross.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.587
Jesus Christ, fine.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.557
Please let her be okay.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.351
Please.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.644
Please let her get good news.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.273
Oh, God, please.

24:43.356 --> 24:46.151
Please let her be okay.

24:50.030 --> 24:53.742
I can't. I can't. I can't.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.869
-I'm cured.
-What? Oh, jeez.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.414
Hi. What--

24:59.498 --> 25:02.167
Henry was kind enough
to lend me this little guy,

25:02.250 --> 25:04.085
and I thought I'd fix it for him.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.674
I mean, Judy did most of the work.
Well, she did all the work.

25:09.758 --> 25:13.053
-But the point is this bird is back.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.513
Oh, great.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.015
-Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you so much.
-No.

25:17.724 --> 25:22.020
You have no idea
how much this bird means to Henry.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.396
-Aww.
-And me.

25:23.480 --> 25:27.442
-You're welcome.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.694
Well, you're, uh, you're very sweet.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.030
Are you kidding? You're the sweet one.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.783
I heard you came
by the house today.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.409
Yeah, I did.

25:36.493 --> 25:40.622
Well, I have no idea what you told my mom,
but she showered.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.957
So, thank you.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.876
And if you can come by every day
and say the same thing,

25:44.960 --> 25:45.961
we'd all appreciate it.

25:46.044 --> 25:46.920
Okay.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.634
-Holy Harmony's sounding tight.
-Yeah.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.011
-You wanna get up there, don't you?
-Yeah. Hold me back.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.888
Okay, I will actually hold you back.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.598
-Whoo!
-Jesus.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.698
Hello?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.367
Yes, this is she.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.369
Hi.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.331
Oh, no, no, no,
please, tell me now.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.504
It definitely is?

26:36.720 --> 26:37.762
Uh-huh?

26:38.471 --> 26:39.514
Yeah, I see.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.852
Yeah, I understand.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.941
No, don't you be sorry.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.611
I'm sorry
that you had to make this call.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.159
Yeah, I will. Thank you.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.495
You have a good night.

27:29.689 --> 27:30.774
-Hey.
-Hi.

27:31.983 --> 27:35.612
All right, I don't know what kind
of visualization sorcery shit you did,

27:35.695 --> 27:37.405
but thank you.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.366
Told you. I had faith.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.618
I'm sorry I was a dick earlier.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.036
You weren't a dick.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.997
-You had a lot on your mind.
-Yeah, but none of that matters.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.333
You. You matter.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.964
I wouldn't be able to live
with myself if something happened to you.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.550
And to think that
I was the reason that you got sick,

27:57.634 --> 27:59.219
it's like I wouldn't-- 

27:59.302 --> 28:01.930
I couldn't fucking forgive myself,
so…

28:03.348 --> 28:04.474
I'm just sorry.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.018
I'm so sorry.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.730
Well, you don't have anything
to worry about 'cause I'm fine.

28:12.023 --> 28:12.857
Wait.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.194
-Did you get the results?
-Yeah, they just called.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.862
Oh! Oh, my God.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.615
Thank God.
Thank God. Thank God.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.951
Way to bury the lede, girl.

28:23.451 --> 28:26.246
Oh, thank God.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.790
-I prayed for you.
-What?

28:28.873 --> 28:30.625
Yeah, I did.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.878
Is it wrong
that I'm a little mad that it worked?

28:33.962 --> 28:34.921
-No.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.632
-Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.511
-You know who's not gonna survive this?
-Who?

28:42.679 --> 28:43.763
This little shit.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.724
Well,
he does have it coming to him.

28:45.807 --> 28:46.683
Yeah.
