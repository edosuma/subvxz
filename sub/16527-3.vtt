09:05.691 --> 09:06.726
(coughing)

09:07.795 --> 09:09.565
Good day, gentlemen.

09:19.852 --> 09:22.423
We're all good in there.

09:22.423 --> 09:24.895
Did you just...

09:24.895 --> 09:27.233
Huh? N‐No. No.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.803
You want to go get
something to eat?

09:28.803 --> 09:30.139
I'm famished.

09:33.078 --> 09:35.182
♪ ♪

09:40.761 --> 09:43.032
CAHILL:
Riggs? Hello?

09:43.032 --> 09:44.334
I'm sorry.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.937
Uh, what was the question?

09:45.937 --> 09:47.975
You‐you asked me a question.

09:47.975 --> 09:49.779
A‐About the protocols
in place

09:49.779 --> 09:51.716
for an officer who
tests positive for drugs

09:51.716 --> 09:54.120
he ingested while
in the line of duty.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.158
Um, sorry. Yeah.

09:56.158 --> 09:58.797
So, Murtaugh and I,
we had to go

09:58.797 --> 10:00.299
investigate this pot party
today and, uh,

10:00.299 --> 10:01.903
there was just a ton
of secondhand smoke,

10:01.903 --> 10:02.905
so... you know.

10:02.905 --> 10:05.209
Just want to make sure
nobody gets in trouble.

10:05.209 --> 10:06.311
(clicks tongue)
You know.

10:06.311 --> 10:09.350
Well, in that case,
there's a form I could give you

10:09.350 --> 10:11.021
that would clear you
from any testing

10:11.021 --> 10:12.524
for the next 90 days.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.827
Perfect.

10:13.827 --> 10:14.795
Can I get one of those?

10:17.968 --> 10:19.437
Do you get high, Riggs?

10:19.437 --> 10:21.843
I mean, when you're not working?

10:21.843 --> 10:23.378
What? No. I mean,

10:23.378 --> 10:24.849
you know, I drink a little.

10:24.849 --> 10:25.984
You know, very occasionally.

10:25.984 --> 10:28.823
Uh, social functions,
holiday parties and the like.

10:28.823 --> 10:30.861
Self‐medicating
with drugs and alcohol,

10:30.861 --> 10:32.798
that's something I talk about
with a lot of people

10:32.798 --> 10:33.867
in this room.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.071
'Cause what's said in this room,
stays in this room.

10:36.071 --> 10:38.242
(sighs)

10:38.242 --> 10:39.979
Well, I tell you what.
(clears throat)

10:39.979 --> 10:41.014
Why don't you talk to Murtaugh

10:41.014 --> 10:42.283
if you think I'm lying?

10:42.283 --> 10:45.089
I didn't say you were.

10:45.089 --> 10:46.859
(pen scribbling)

10:46.859 --> 10:49.097
(clears throat)

10:49.097 --> 10:50.867
(sighs)

10:52.604 --> 10:55.844
So I woke up this morning,
uh, with the TV on,

10:55.844 --> 10:57.881
and, uh, you know,
there's one of those

10:57.881 --> 11:00.252
annoying commercials where the
couples are frolicking around,

11:00.252 --> 11:02.123
you know, overly happy.

11:02.123 --> 11:05.129
(sighs)

11:05.129 --> 11:06.532
And it was difficult
to watch.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.168
What did you do?

11:10.139 --> 11:12.376
Shot the TV.

11:14.147 --> 11:16.151
NED:
<i>How are Trish and the kids?</i>

11:16.151 --> 11:18.021
Oh, you know,
Trish is Trish.

11:18.021 --> 11:19.424
Kicking ass,
taking names.

11:19.424 --> 11:20.927
And, you know,
we have the baby now,

11:20.927 --> 11:24.100
which is crazy, you know,
starting over again.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.871
I can't believe
you're doing that.

11:25.871 --> 11:27.139
I mean, I can't believe
you didn't just

11:27.139 --> 11:28.543
take the pension
and hang it up.

11:28.543 --> 11:31.014
I'll hang it up when
the bad guys do.

11:31.014 --> 11:33.586
How's Sarah?

11:33.586 --> 11:36.324
Sarah died of ovarian cancer
six months ago.

11:36.324 --> 11:39.297
What? Oh, God, no.

11:39.297 --> 11:43.038
Sarah wanted to keep it
very private.

11:43.038 --> 11:44.575
Died like she lived.

11:44.575 --> 11:47.146
Ned, I wish I could have
been there for you.

11:47.146 --> 11:49.150
Well, I was married to the job

11:49.150 --> 11:50.486
the first 20 years with Sarah,

11:50.486 --> 11:56.064
and... the next 20 were
supposed to be ours, for us.

11:56.064 --> 11:59.370
Best laid plans,
right?

11:59.370 --> 12:02.043
Look at this.
Little family reunion.

12:02.043 --> 12:04.280
This warrants a little bit
of scotch at least, right?

12:04.280 --> 12:05.617
You know,
for this reunion,

12:05.617 --> 12:07.587
a Babs would be
more appropriate.

12:07.587 --> 12:09.190
A Babs!

12:09.190 --> 12:11.328
Even better.
What's her number?

12:11.328 --> 12:12.430
Wait a minute,
he doesn't know...

12:12.430 --> 12:14.334
he doesn't know
what a Babs is?
No.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.570
Are you
teaching him <i>nothing?</i>

12:15.570 --> 12:17.941
It is not that
I'm not teaching him,

12:17.941 --> 12:19.511
he's just not learning.

12:19.511 --> 12:22.450
A Babs‐‐ Bad Ass
Breakfast Sandwich.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.287
Roger used to
bring me one every Friday

12:24.287 --> 12:26.057
from the only deli
that does it right.

12:26.057 --> 12:27.627
In Hawthorne.

12:27.627 --> 12:28.997
Good little trainee.

12:28.997 --> 12:31.267
(laughs)
This guy...

12:31.267 --> 12:33.071
So you guys solve
the case yet?

12:33.071 --> 12:34.975
Not yet.

12:34.975 --> 12:36.378
Is there anything else
about these guys?

12:36.378 --> 12:40.587
Uh, yeah, the one thing,
there was this smell‐‐

12:40.587 --> 12:42.991
this earthy kind
of incense.

12:42.991 --> 12:43.926
Patchouli oil.

12:43.926 --> 12:46.431
What did Carlson say
about tax day pick‐up?

12:46.431 --> 12:48.669
Only her clients knew?
Lonnie...

12:48.669 --> 12:49.437
And Donnie.

12:49.437 --> 12:51.408
You know, for
being new partners,

12:51.408 --> 12:52.476
you guys are
pretty good together.

12:52.476 --> 12:54.548
Ehh...
Ehh...

13:00.426 --> 13:01.896
MURTAUGH (loudly):
Lonnie?

13:01.896 --> 13:03.833
Donnie?

13:05.235 --> 13:07.406
LAPD. Hello?

13:09.678 --> 13:11.381
Hello?

13:20.399 --> 13:23.606
Well, we found
our pot heads.

13:32.657 --> 13:35.496
Honey, when did
you get home?

13:35.496 --> 13:38.034
15 minutes ago.
You were in the shower.

13:38.034 --> 13:40.439
I pulled an all‐nighter.

13:40.439 --> 13:44.380
Two murders.
Decapitations. Savage.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.351
Decapitations?

13:46.351 --> 13:49.056
Mm‐hmm.
Good Lord.

13:49.056 --> 13:51.261
I just came home to get
a decent cup of coffee

13:51.261 --> 13:53.198
before I head back
to the office.

13:53.198 --> 13:57.173
Well, you're gonna need
some sleep when you get home.

13:57.173 --> 13:58.108
(groans)

13:58.108 --> 14:00.078
It's a good thing
we pushed the date night.

14:00.078 --> 14:02.116
No.

14:02.116 --> 14:03.351
It's not a good thing.

14:03.351 --> 14:05.122
Do we still have reservations?

14:05.122 --> 14:06.959
At Fruit and Barrow?
I cancelled.

14:06.959 --> 14:08.663
But I can make a call,
if you're sure.

14:08.663 --> 14:12.203
I ran into Ned Brower
yesterday.

14:12.203 --> 14:15.342
Sarah died.
Six months ago.

14:15.342 --> 14:17.079
Cancer.
No.

14:17.079 --> 14:19.350
He said he wanted to
spend time with her

14:19.350 --> 14:21.321
once he retired.

14:21.321 --> 14:23.191
I don't want to be Ned.

14:23.191 --> 14:25.997
Date night... tonight.

14:25.997 --> 14:27.433
I'll move some
things around.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.070
Okay, if it's not
that important.

14:29.070 --> 14:31.341
It's work.
(scoffs)

14:31.341 --> 14:35.349
This... this is
important.

14:37.486 --> 14:40.627
Hey, look who's here.

14:40.627 --> 14:42.129
TRISH: Oh, gosh.
(chuckles)

14:44.066 --> 14:45.536
Invite him in.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.406
I love you.
I love you, too.

14:47.406 --> 14:48.643
Hey, Riggs!

14:52.116 --> 14:54.253
What are you doing here?

14:54.253 --> 14:55.790
What?

14:55.790 --> 14:58.228
I'm here.
Why?

14:58.228 --> 14:59.798
Here is <i>there.</i>

14:59.798 --> 15:01.467
No, no, no.

15:01.467 --> 15:04.173
<i>There</i> is the office.

15:04.173 --> 15:05.475
<i>Here</i> is my house.
(groans)

15:05.475 --> 15:08.649
We meet <i>there,</i> and then
we drive together.

15:10.319 --> 15:11.487
So now what do we do?

15:11.487 --> 15:13.559
I'm gonna go
take a shower.

15:13.559 --> 15:15.028
Try not to steal nothin'.

15:15.028 --> 15:16.732
(sighs)

15:21.575 --> 15:25.616
♪ Feels so good
to be walking... ♪

15:25.616 --> 15:29.256
Just make yourself
at home, Riggs.

15:29.256 --> 15:31.394
Oh, thanks.
I already did.

15:31.394 --> 15:34.266
So how long were you
waiting back there?

15:34.266 --> 15:35.570
I was gonna come in,
you know,

15:35.570 --> 15:37.674
but I didn't want to
barge in on you and Trish.

15:37.674 --> 15:40.445
You seemed happy.
Hmm.

15:40.445 --> 15:42.416
Luckiest traffic
stop ever.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.253
I was a rookie on patrol.

15:44.253 --> 15:46.157
Pulled over a speeder.

15:46.157 --> 15:47.694
Trish?
Yeah.

15:47.694 --> 15:49.631
What'd you do, waive the ticket
and get her number?

15:49.631 --> 15:51.535
Hell no.
I wrote the ticket.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.771
She showed up
at traffic court.

15:52.771 --> 15:55.843
She contested it.
Kicked my ass.

15:55.843 --> 15:57.312
And then I got
her number.

15:57.312 --> 15:58.849
That was one good
traffic stop.

15:58.849 --> 15:59.785
MURTAUGH:
Yeah.

15:59.785 --> 16:01.120
Not to be
too personal,

16:01.120 --> 16:02.724
but things are still
kinda, you know,

16:02.724 --> 16:04.795
frisky with us.
(chuckles)

16:04.795 --> 16:07.600
No, please, elaborate.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.671
I mean, you know,
I'm just saying

16:09.671 --> 16:11.374
I don't want
to take it for granted,

16:11.374 --> 16:13.411
because these things can
just disappear.

16:13.411 --> 16:14.548
At any moment?

16:15.817 --> 16:18.154
Yeah.

16:18.154 --> 16:19.825
Sorry about that,
I, you know, I was...

16:19.825 --> 16:20.927
Look, it's okay.

16:20.927 --> 16:23.164
You should be able to talk
about these kind of things.

16:25.435 --> 16:28.374
Hey, you know, I was thinking,
we should talk to Gang Unit

16:28.374 --> 16:29.744
about decapitation...

16:32.115 --> 16:32.917
Whoa.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.721
Decapitation can be
very disturbing.

16:34.721 --> 16:37.493
No, that breakfast
of yours is disturbing.

16:37.493 --> 16:39.497
This is just
not right, man.

16:39.497 --> 16:40.833
You don't want in on this?
No.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.473
You know, I saw
some decaps in Texas.

16:44.473 --> 16:46.277
All cartel‐related.

16:46.277 --> 16:49.618
And they always outsourced
their wet work to local gangs.

16:49.618 --> 16:51.722
You may be onto something.

16:53.759 --> 16:54.895
You know,
I‐I can't do this.

16:54.895 --> 16:56.464
I can't...
I can't talk to you

16:56.464 --> 16:57.767
while you're eating
like that.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.436
You can't
or you won't?

16:59.436 --> 17:02.109
Both, Riggs. Both.

17:05.448 --> 17:07.185
MAN:
<i>Negative.</i>

17:07.185 --> 17:08.454
Cartels aren't in L. A.

17:08.454 --> 17:09.658
If you're looking
for head choppers,

17:09.658 --> 17:11.394
try the Jamaicans.

17:11.394 --> 17:13.331
Kingston Boys,
over on Manchester.

17:13.331 --> 17:14.400
I'll send you intel.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.503
MURTAUGH:
Thanks for the tip.

17:18.308 --> 17:20.145
Hey, young man,
what's your name?

17:22.149 --> 17:22.984
Cruz.

17:22.984 --> 17:24.754
Nasty scar you got there
on your neck.

17:24.754 --> 17:27.225
Something you can
tell us?

17:27.225 --> 17:28.729
Just what Sarge said.
(Riggs laughs)

17:28.729 --> 17:30.198
"Just what Sarge said."

17:30.198 --> 17:31.434
This kid, I don't know
if he's more scared

17:31.434 --> 17:32.503
of his Sarge
or his shadow.

17:32.503 --> 17:33.772
I ain't afraid
of anything.

17:33.772 --> 17:37.346
Good, because here's
the deal, Cruz.

17:37.346 --> 17:38.816
We have two
headless bodies,

17:38.816 --> 17:41.555
not in Mexico,
in L. A.

17:41.555 --> 17:44.393
Okay, look, the cartels
are active in L. A.

17:44.393 --> 17:46.765
But I hear they're
outsourcing to local gangs.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.201
You hear?
(chuckles)

17:48.201 --> 17:50.673
All right, man.
Good luck growing a pair.

17:50.673 --> 17:52.710
I used to roll
with the Locos.

17:54.279 --> 17:55.916
They'd take cartel jobs.

17:55.916 --> 17:57.352
The Locos?
That who burned

17:57.352 --> 17:59.490
the gang tat off your
neck after you quit?

17:59.490 --> 18:02.496
No. I burned it off.

18:02.496 --> 18:04.768
Look, check the heads.

18:04.768 --> 18:06.538
The cartels use machetes.

18:06.538 --> 18:08.241
It might get you somewhere.

18:08.241 --> 18:10.780
Hey, Cruz.

18:10.780 --> 18:12.382
You want to roll with us?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.788
Play homicide detective
for a little while?

18:14.788 --> 18:16.758
You could sit on his lap.

18:16.758 --> 18:17.794
He'll let you play
with the siren.

18:17.794 --> 18:20.298
RIGGS: He loves the siren.
I hate it.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.475
Definitely a machete,
but, here's a plot twist.

18:25.475 --> 18:27.580
The decapitation
was post‐mortem.

18:27.580 --> 18:29.918
Cause of death
was electrocution,

18:29.918 --> 18:31.287
courtesy of...

18:31.287 --> 18:33.424
wait for it...

28:19.395 --> 28:21.432
On second thought.
Hey...

28:21.432 --> 28:23.403
Thanks!

28:26.342 --> 28:28.881
Paco, my brother!
What's up, <i>ese?</i>

28:28.881 --> 28:30.417
Look, I'm sorry about the wait.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.288
The traffic to the
west side was a bitch.

28:32.288 --> 28:34.559
But I got the sandwich
I promised you.

28:34.559 --> 28:36.530
What the hell
are you talking about?

28:36.530 --> 28:39.302
A Godmother's with the works.
Extra pepperoncinis.

28:39.302 --> 28:42.207
Did I screw it up?
Was it no pepperoncinis?

28:42.207 --> 28:43.978
This cop bringing you
room service?

28:43.978 --> 28:45.447
Man, I don't know
this guy. I don't know

28:45.447 --> 28:48.219
nothing about a sandwich.
Come on, man!
Paco!

28:48.219 --> 28:49.957
Now, I am a man of my word.
We had a deal.

28:49.957 --> 28:51.326
You cooperate with
the investigation,

28:51.326 --> 28:54.198

beloved Godmother, I...

28:55.267 --> 28:57.204
Easy. Get these guys
out of here.

28:57.204 --> 28:58.340
Sit down.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.991
Hey. You put a snitch
jacket on me.

29:06.991 --> 29:07.993
You're gonna get me shanked.

29:07.993 --> 29:10.297
I guess you better start
talking, or I'm gonna

29:10.297 --> 29:12.167
personally deliver you
a basket of muffins

29:12.167 --> 29:14.606
every day at chow.

29:14.606 --> 29:16.342
Hmm.

29:18.113 --> 29:20.017
(sighs)
What do you want to know?

29:20.017 --> 29:21.052
Where's the money?

29:21.052 --> 29:22.589
I have no clue.

29:22.589 --> 29:24.960
All right. It's gonna
be bran muffins,

29:24.960 --> 29:26.229
to keep you regular.

29:26.229 --> 29:28.366
Look... I zapped

29:28.366 --> 29:31.205
those pot store fools
for an hour.

29:31.205 --> 29:33.343
They swore they didn't
have the money.

29:33.343 --> 29:35.013

Well, they copped

29:35.013 --> 29:35.882

29:35.882 --> 29:37.519
said someone else
stole it off them.

29:37.519 --> 29:39.523
Names?
They didn't know.

29:39.523 --> 29:42.227
Said no one else was
in on the heist, no one even

29:42.227 --> 29:45.400
knew the money was stolen except
the... the driver they jacked.

29:47.505 --> 29:49.375

29:53.283 --> 29:56.089

29:56.089 --> 29:59.195

they all said
there was no hope.

29:59.195 --> 30:01.299
Course, the insurance
wouldn't cover it,

30:01.299 --> 30:03.637

I cashed in my pension.

30:17.030 --> 30:18.233

from those idiots for years,

30:27.619 --> 30:30.457

So,

30:30.457 --> 30:32.361
you just went to the house,
found the truck,

30:32.361 --> 30:34.365
and just drove it away?

30:34.365 --> 30:36.169
It was so easy.

30:36.169 --> 30:39.709
Then I heard about what happened
to those guys, and I...

30:42.281 --> 30:44.786

I screwed up.

30:44.786 --> 30:47.391
Yeah, Ned. You did.

30:49.061 --> 30:51.365

are you doing here?

31:19.756 --> 31:22.361
I could ask you
the same question.

31:22.361 --> 31:24.131
Ned's new ride?

31:24.131 --> 31:27.371
Okay, I should've called you
before I came here.

31:27.371 --> 31:29.041
Look, it's okay.

31:29.041 --> 31:30.711

down in county lockup.

31:46.142 --> 31:47.679
Well, all right.
Yeah, I appreciate that.

31:47.679 --> 31:49.281
Let's go. Take me in.

31:49.281 --> 31:52.287
A... minute

31:52.287 --> 31:53.791
Just... one second, Ned.

31:53.791 --> 31:55.695

31:55.695 --> 31:58.299
(whispering):
We can't do this.

31:58.299 --> 31:59.569
He won't last five
minutes in lockup.

31:59.569 --> 32:02.508
Do I need to remind you
of our dear friend Paco?

32:02.508 --> 32:04.411
He stole $17 million, Riggs.

32:04.411 --> 32:06.415
I can't turn a
blind eye to that.

32:06.415 --> 32:09.121
I agree. We need
to take him in.

32:09.121 --> 32:11.560
So... Same page.
Tomorrow.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.697
Tonight, we just
take the money in.

32:13.697 --> 32:15.233
(sighs)

32:15.233 --> 32:16.435
It's our only shot.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.674
Rog. If we go by
the book on this,

32:18.674 --> 32:21.445
he'll be dead in 24 hours.

32:21.445 --> 32:22.682
NED: I know what
you guys are thinking,

32:22.682 --> 32:24.519
and I can't let you do it.

32:24.519 --> 32:27.190
You're not gonna throw your
careers away for me.
RIGGS: Well,

32:27.190 --> 32:29.562
to be honest, Ned, I don't have
much of a career anyway.

32:29.562 --> 32:30.831
MURTAUGH:
Look... I wouldn't have

32:30.831 --> 32:34.171

32:34.171 --> 32:36.108
I owe you.

32:36.108 --> 32:37.578
You don't owe me.

32:37.578 --> 32:39.716
It's the job.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.391
Do your job.

32:44.391 --> 32:47.097
We're gonna take that money in.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.203
We're coming back
for you tomorrow.

32:53.877 --> 32:55.413
Hey.

32:55.413 --> 32:57.250
This man's solid gold.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.522
You take care of him,
you understand?

33:00.691 --> 33:03.262
You can count on it.

33:03.262 --> 33:06.302
Kiss of death.

33:06.302 --> 33:09.809
You know, normally I would
say, uh, head to Mexico.

33:09.809 --> 33:13.282
North might be better
for your situation.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.153
Good luck.

33:19.428 --> 33:20.497
<i>I should have never let you</i>

33:20.497 --> 33:21.833
talk me into this.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.402
Rog, come on,
it was the only way.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.473
I mean, I love the man,
but he stole

33:25.473 --> 33:27.210
150 bricks of cold hard cash.

33:27.210 --> 33:28.881
149.

33:28.881 --> 33:31.151
No, it was 150.
Trust me.

33:31.151 --> 33:32.287
Let's say 149.

33:32.287 --> 33:36.161
Damn it, Riggs, giving Ned money
wasn't part of the plan!

33:36.161 --> 33:37.632
Uh, in fairness,
I didn't have a plan.

33:37.632 --> 33:38.634
Yes, we did.

33:38.634 --> 33:39.736
We were gonna turn in the money

33:39.736 --> 33:41.438
and give Ned
a few hours' head start.

33:41.438 --> 33:42.909
No, that was your plan, okay?

33:42.909 --> 33:43.610
My plan is driving

33:43.610 --> 33:44.913
this to some
beach somewhere

33:44.913 --> 33:47.284
and settling down
like Butch and Sundance.
Butch and Sundance?

33:47.284 --> 33:48.720
(cell phone ringing)
Do you know that...?

33:48.720 --> 33:51.425
Ned, you'd better be
halfway to Vancouver

33:51.425 --> 33:52.662
by now.

33:52.662 --> 33:54.264
Rog, I'm sorry.

33:54.264 --> 33:55.266
Sorry for what?

33:55.266 --> 33:58.674
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need
that money back.

34:20.383 --> 34:22.955
There's supposed to be
an even exchange,

34:22.955 --> 34:24.792
Ned for the money.

34:24.792 --> 34:26.295
Two of them,
two of us.

34:26.295 --> 34:27.898
But surprise, surprise.

34:27.898 --> 34:29.802
Gangbangers suck at math.

34:29.802 --> 34:31.372
I'm counting six.

34:33.910 --> 34:35.781
RIGGS:
And a few more behind us.

34:35.781 --> 34:37.585
Well, by my calculations,

34:37.585 --> 34:40.390
we're severely
outnumbered and outgunned.

34:40.390 --> 34:42.962
So, how do you want
to play this, Riggs?

34:42.962 --> 34:44.599
You asking me if I got a plan?

34:44.599 --> 34:46.936
Against my better judgment,
I am.

34:46.936 --> 34:48.840

35:06.743 --> 35:08.513

Go ahead and call
for backup, Rog.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.690

35:26.716 --> 35:28.587
At least they're

39:03.215 --> 39:04.752
<i>to give a thankful citizen</i>
<i>her money back.</i>

39:04.752 --> 39:06.622
AVERY:
Angela's head was just found

39:06.622 --> 39:08.058
in a garbage dump in Tijuana.

39:09.595 --> 39:11.699
Well, we can be
in TJ by midnight

39:11.699 --> 39:12.968
and interface with
the Mexican authorities

39:12.968 --> 39:14.605
to get...
We're off the case.

39:14.605 --> 39:15.907
It's the DEA's
jurisdiction now.

39:15.907 --> 39:17.544
You guys recovered
the money,

39:17.544 --> 39:19.515
closed two homicides,
but if you want to keep going,

39:19.515 --> 39:20.784
there's still one open case.

39:20.784 --> 39:21.719
BOTH:
What's that?

39:21.719 --> 39:23.690
Fugitive recovery. Ned Brower.

39:23.690 --> 39:24.892
Any ideas where he might be?

39:24.892 --> 39:26.027
Mm‐mm, I ain't seen him.
I don't know.

39:26.027 --> 39:27.196
It's like he
disappeared.
Yeah.

39:27.196 --> 39:28.432
It was like a genie.
Gone.

39:28.432 --> 39:32.674
The two of you agreeing with
each other... now that's scary.

39:38.218 --> 39:40.122
Do you know how to knock?

39:40.122 --> 39:42.226
I owed you a sandwich.

39:42.226 --> 39:43.763
Well, half a sandwich.

39:43.763 --> 39:46.001
There you go.

39:46.001 --> 39:47.604
Headed home?

39:47.604 --> 39:49.140
Nah. A lot of paperwork.

39:49.140 --> 39:50.510
Riggs, you can hide
in the office.

39:50.510 --> 39:52.848
You can hide in the bottle.

39:52.848 --> 39:55.987
You can shoot your TV,
get high, whatever.

39:55.987 --> 39:58.860
You don't have to talk to me.

39:58.860 --> 40:00.897
But do you talk to anyone?

40:00.897 --> 40:03.536
Well...

40:03.536 --> 40:05.105
Your father‐in‐law?

40:06.876 --> 40:09.848
I do due diligence
on all my clients.

40:10.750 --> 40:12.788
He must miss her, too.

40:14.892 --> 40:16.929
Talking to him's not
what I need right now.

40:16.929 --> 40:19.902
It may not be what you need...

40:19.902 --> 40:22.206
