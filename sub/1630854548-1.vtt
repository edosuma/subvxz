14:21.819 --> 14:22.945
Why aren't you?

14:23.028 --> 14:24.613
Because I can think
of better ways

14:24.697 --> 14:27.575
of wasting my time,
like trying to eat my own face.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.618
So you're not concerned
about the girl?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.829
[Jane] Of course
I'm fucking concerned.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.789
But Kay constructed this place.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.249
And if she doesn't
want to be found,

14:35.332 --> 14:37.501
[softly] we're not
going to find her.

14:37.585 --> 14:41.547
So you're here in her memories,
enjoying warm beverages.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.800
I'm doing something
actually useful.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.261
I'm trying to figure out
what the girl needs.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.056
-Wanna know what I think?
-Mmm.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.978
Yeah, more than anything
I've ever wanted in my
entire miserable life.

14:56.061 --> 15:00.733
I think you're on
vacation here.

15:00.816 --> 15:04.987
Hiding in the girl's memories
to avoid your responsibilities.

15:05.070 --> 15:09.700
How relieved you must feel
of not having the weight
of it all on your shoulders.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.995
Or maybe this is just
sour grapes.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.914
After all,
the girl did disappear,

15:16.665 --> 15:17.833
under your watch.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.960
Mmm.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.338
Remind me where you went
to medical school again?

15:22.421 --> 15:26.759
Was it the University
of I-Watched-A-Shit-Ton-
Of-Sally-Jesse-Raphael?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.595
Enjoy your stay, Jane.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.396
[door creaking, closing]

15:40.105 --> 15:42.775
[drilling]

15:43.692 --> 15:44.985
-Looks good.
-Yep.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.029
So then, boom!

15:47.112 --> 15:48.906
With the press
of a cell phone button,

15:48.989 --> 15:51.659
she teleported the entire bus
of Edgelords into
the Phantom Zone,

15:51.742 --> 15:53.243
which they didn't seem to hate.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.704
But we, uh,
we busted them out anyway.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.873
[laughs]
Cell Phone Silvia, huh?

15:57.956 --> 16:00.709
-Yup!
-And what was your part
in this caper?

16:00.793 --> 16:04.046
Me? Yeah, I, um...

16:04.129 --> 16:06.382
I downloaded her phone's
user menu from the internet.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.676
That thing is over
ten years old.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.427
Man! That was hard to find.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.804
Sounds like
you're keeping busy.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.389
Yeah.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.724
But, um,

16:15.808 --> 16:17.685
are you leaving any time
to find your bliss?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.188
[exhales sharply]

16:21.271 --> 16:24.149
I didn't ditch my tech
to spite you.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.695
When are you gonna understand
that this choice was about me?

16:29.988 --> 16:31.281
It wasn't an accusation, son.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.701
I'm sorry.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.369
[sighs]

16:35.452 --> 16:38.706
The truth is,
this isn't as easy
as I thought it would be.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.875
Scary tryin' to find yourself,
isn't it?

16:43.919 --> 16:45.754
I think I'd rather take on
an Edgelord.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.840
[laughs]

16:47.923 --> 16:49.758
Now, just give yourself time.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.759
You'll get there.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.761
[sighs]

16:52.845 --> 16:54.012
Looks like we're done here.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.472
Thanks for your help
on this, Dad.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.516
He's gonna be psyched.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.309
Of course.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.103
It was fun.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.188
Yeah, it was.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.024
Let's gather the troops.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.153
[alarm blaring]

17:12.823 --> 17:14.950
[Cliff] All right, all right,
all right.

17:15.033 --> 17:18.328
Whose face are we stomping
justice into today?

17:18.412 --> 17:20.581
Is that my fucking arm?

17:21.665 --> 17:22.791
As a matter of fact, it is.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.044
[chuckling] Fuck.
Fucking sweetness!

17:27.421 --> 17:29.298
Why is everyone
else here?

17:29.381 --> 17:33.469
Well, we couldn't make
your arm exactly
like it was so, um,

17:34.887 --> 17:37.139
we decided to make it better.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.224
Looks like the same
old shitty robot arm

17:39.308 --> 17:44.313
with the same old shitty
robot fingers that
I can't type for shit with,

17:44.396 --> 17:45.814
or write, or bowl.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.899
We...

17:48.275 --> 17:50.986
We gave you
the sense of touch...

17:52.821 --> 17:53.739
In one finger.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.741
But over time,

17:55.824 --> 17:57.534
if things work the way
they're supposed to,

17:57.618 --> 18:00.871
the nanites will spread
to your other fingers.

18:00.954 --> 18:01.997
[Cliff gasps] Wh...

18:03.582 --> 18:05.667
I'll be able to feel
with my whole hand?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.169
That's the plan, Robotman.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.046
[gasps]

18:14.092 --> 18:16.261
[chuckling] I don't know
what to say.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.222
[laughs] Thank you!

18:18.305 --> 18:21.141
Uh, from my bottom
of my non-existent heart.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.392
-[chuckling]
-[Vic groaning] All right.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.852
-[Silas] Okay.
-[Vic] All right.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.062
[chuckles]

18:25.145 --> 18:25.896
[muffled groans from
Vic and Silas]

18:25.979 --> 18:27.314
[laughs]

18:27.397 --> 18:28.857
[clears throat]

18:35.614 --> 18:37.199
[laughing]

18:37.282 --> 18:40.244
And this how you say
"Fuck you" in England.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.331
Now we can calibrate
your sense of touch.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.541
Let's start with the cotton.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.709
Uh, would it be okay
if I didn't?

18:48.836 --> 18:50.379
It would be better if you did.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.881
You... you mind telling us
why you don't want to?

18:55.467 --> 18:58.262
I haven't felt anything
for 40 years.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.848
I think the first thing
I'd like to touch
is my grandson.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.064
-[Cliff sighs]
-Cliff,

19:09.147 --> 19:11.859
not to be a spoilsport
but technically,

19:11.942 --> 19:14.444
you are touching
that oven mitt.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.989
Doesn't count. Doesn't count.

19:17.072 --> 19:21.702
But, goddamn, it's soft.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.413
Come on, fuck nuts!

19:24.496 --> 19:26.290
To the time machine!

19:26.373 --> 19:28.250
We're going
to fucking Florida!

19:28.333 --> 19:31.670
Um, Clifford,
I know that you are excited,

19:31.753 --> 19:34.256
but the time machine
is not an Uber.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.466
It is a crime
fighting apparatus.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.260
[Madame Rouge]
Oh, come on, Rita.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.763
What is the harm in a wee jaunt
to America's sweaty armpit?

19:41.847 --> 19:43.932
This is a joyous occasion.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.309
Why don't you make
a little exception?

19:45.392 --> 19:46.977
Oh, what's the harm?

19:47.060 --> 19:49.021
-Yeah, come on, Rita.
-Don't be so controlling.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.772
-Be cool for once.
-[sighs]

19:50.856 --> 19:52.774
All right, all right,
all right.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.610
Just this once.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.362
Fuck yeah, let's roll!

19:57.446 --> 19:59.531
I think I'll sit this one out.
I am allergic to jellyfish

19:59.615 --> 20:01.116
and experimental
fringe science.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.409
-Take care, son.
-[chuckling] All right, Dad.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.785
I'll talk to you.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.247
Um, Rita, a private word?

20:07.331 --> 20:09.124
What is it?

20:09.207 --> 20:12.794
Uh, well, I, um, thought
over time if I consumed
enough of your shit,

20:12.878 --> 20:15.380
-I-I'd earn your forgiveness
but I'm realizing that's...
-[scoffs]

20:15.464 --> 20:19.134
Probably never gonna happen.
And since my presence here
is a constant trigger for you,

20:19.217 --> 20:21.929
I was thinking, perhaps maybe,
once I...

20:22.012 --> 20:24.973
Well, perhaps maybe,
once we all return
from Florida,

20:25.057 --> 20:27.059
it might be best
that I find somewhere else
to live.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.770
Unless of course,
you can find it
in your heart to...

20:30.687 --> 20:31.647
[sighs]

20:31.730 --> 20:32.606
Forgive me.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.279
[clicks tongue]
I hear there are a lot
of nice efficiencies

20:39.363 --> 20:42.574
in Cloverton,
if you don't mind
getting scabies.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.992
I... I don't actually.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.827
And perhaps maybe
you could give me...

20:48.872 --> 20:50.040
[clicks tongue]

20:50.123 --> 20:52.292
Give me the address.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.170
This is the best day
of my entire freaking life!

20:56.254 --> 20:58.215
Can we leave already?

20:58.298 --> 20:59.758
Why have we not left yet?

21:01.051 --> 21:02.719
No, thank you.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.472
No, you listen here,
Madame Rouge.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.767
You will put this jellyfish
on top of your peanut head

21:08.850 --> 21:12.187
because I want you to remember
every word of your promise

21:12.270 --> 21:13.897
to leave my home.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.693
Oh, fucking--

21:17.776 --> 21:20.529
Okay, Florida five minutes
from now. Everybody ready?

21:20.612 --> 21:21.613
[seatbelt clicks]

21:21.697 --> 21:22.781

21:26.118 --> 21:28.662

Are you Animal Vegetable

22:07.367 --> 22:09.953
Damn it!
I thought that'd be harder.

What else could possibly
fit that description?

it's probably another

22:24.885 --> 22:26.470
Let's not get paranoid.

It's a woman.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.439
Is this bad? 'Cause this
feels pretty fucking bad.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.024
I don't think it's good.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.400
I know her.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.070
She likes to watch people pee.
No judgement.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.280
That's Isabel Feathers.

22:45.363 --> 22:46.615
Who?

22:46.698 --> 22:48.450
The talentless wannabe
who portrayed me

22:48.533 --> 22:50.744
in the Cloverton Theatre's
Our Town, huh.

22:50.827 --> 22:51.953
[Isabel] Help, help me!

22:52.037 --> 22:53.622
-[Vic] Should we let her in?
-No.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.958
Let me in. Let me in.
Let me in. Let me in. [screams]

22:57.042 --> 22:58.627
What's she doing
in the time stream?

22:58.710 --> 23:00.295
Uh, that might be my bad.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.130
When I arrived in Cloverton,

23:02.214 --> 23:04.257
she watched me taking
a massive wazz,

23:04.341 --> 23:06.468
then fell
right into my time hole.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.804
I... I didn't think
it was worth mentioning.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.640
Please! Angry Jesus!

23:11.723 --> 23:13.892
Don't let me die
before I touch my grandbaby!

23:13.975 --> 23:16.812
[automated voice speaking]
Arrival imminent.
Arrival imminent.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.855
When are we headed, Victor?
What year?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.440
No idea.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.484
Everybody brace for impact.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.902
This is gonna be
a rough landing.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.762
[Rita] Is everyone okay?

23:50.846 --> 23:51.805
[Larry] I think so.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.474
Where on earth are we?

23:56.268 --> 23:58.186
When are we?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.563
[Cliff] Doesn't matter
and don't care.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.439
Let's just hop back
into Shipley

24:01.523 --> 24:03.483
and get back on track
to the FLA.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.193
Shipley's overheated.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.320
It's gonna be a while
before we can shove off again.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.739
I think I know where we are.

24:11.449 --> 24:13.285
[Madame Rouge] Um...

24:13.368 --> 24:17.038
I think we went
a little further than
five minutes into the future.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.213
Well, what do you suppose
the shotgun is for?

24:25.297 --> 24:28.133
[growling]

24:28.216 --> 24:30.051
For whatever the fuck that is.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.553
Executive decision.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.471
Yep.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.725
And... and go
where exactly?

24:36.808 --> 24:38.268
[Larry] There's no place
like home.

24:46.067 --> 24:46.902
Wow.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.447
This reminds me
of my mother's house.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.824
She was a hoarder,

24:54.326 --> 24:55.785
and a war profiteer.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.289
The air's really stale.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.375
Maybe no one's
living here anymore.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.419
Well, we'd better
have a look through
just in case.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.840
Everyone,
I have found something.

25:10.508 --> 25:11.509
What is it?

25:13.053 --> 25:13.970
[Rita] Hmm.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.805
Vienna sausages and Skittles.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.600
Ew. On both fronts.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.269
I haven't seen shit like this
since the '70s.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.688
And we were all
high as fuck back then.

25:23.772 --> 25:24.731
No, wait.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.274
[lever clicking]

25:26.358 --> 25:27.943
-[all screaming]
-[thudding]

25:28.026 --> 25:30.612
-[Madame Rouge]
Fucking asshole!
-[Vic] Why did you do that?

25:30.695 --> 25:31.821
God.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.490
-[Cliff] Oops.
-[Madame Rouge] Idiot!

25:33.573 --> 25:34.783
-[Vic] You had
to touch the weiner?
-[distant thuds]

25:34.866 --> 25:36.451
[whispers] Quiet.
We're not alone.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.509
Welcome to 2042.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.803
[Cliff] Holy shit bears!

25:56.972 --> 25:58.515
Who is it?

25:58.598 --> 26:00.183
[Cliff] It's you.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.978
A rusty, busted version of you.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.980
The hell? Yo, let me through.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.731
Yo, let me through.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.608
If this mitt falls off
and I touch something
that isn't...

26:08.692 --> 26:09.859
-Someone is kicking me.
Stop kicking me.
-...my grandson's

26:09.943 --> 26:11.278
-perfect skin...
-[grunting]

26:11.361 --> 26:14.531
...I will murder every
single one of you.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.700
-[Cliff whispering]
This is weird.
-[all shushing]

26:18.118 --> 26:19.286
What's that on your face?

26:21.496 --> 26:22.497
Is that tech?

26:36.177 --> 26:37.220
Who wants tea?

26:41.016 --> 26:43.184
[Future Vic] It all started
about 20 years ago,

26:45.270 --> 26:47.355
Cloverton was the epicenter.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.482
Spread slow at first

26:49.566 --> 26:51.484
and after a few weeks
it was everywhere.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.155
[Cliff] Hey, Omega man,

26:55.238 --> 26:56.948
you wanna skip the dramatics

26:57.032 --> 27:00.076
and just tell us
what the lemon drizzled
[shouting] fuck happened?

27:01.119 --> 27:03.330
Papers called it
The Buttpocalypse.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.789
[all snickering]

27:06.833 --> 27:08.209
I think he's serious.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.795
No, that's impossible.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.505
We killed those assholes.

27:12.589 --> 27:13.673
Apparently, we missed one.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.384
And infected it with zombiism.

27:16.468 --> 27:20.138
You mean to tell us
the world has been overtaken

27:20.221 --> 27:22.098
by Zombie Butts?

27:22.182 --> 27:23.808
[Larry] That we created?

27:23.892 --> 27:26.144
I mean, the zombie part anyway.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.645
It's about
the size of it, yeah.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.066
Where are the rest of us?

27:31.149 --> 27:33.318
You tend to stick to your rooms
for the most part.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.487
Go say hi if you want.

27:44.829 --> 27:45.789
Rouge.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.252
[Madame Rouge sighs]

27:51.336 --> 27:53.004
You won't find anyone
in your room.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.131
Oh.

27:55.882 --> 27:58.009
Did I change rooms?

28:00.053 --> 28:02.430
Did I just pop out
for my laundry?

28:02.514 --> 28:05.350
Well, that can only mean
one thing. [sighs]

28:05.433 --> 28:07.560
I am at a LARPing retreat.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.145
I am dead then, aren't I?

28:09.229 --> 28:11.773
Actually, I don't know
what happened to you.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.527
You moved out
right before shit kicked off.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.613
We lost track
of you soon after.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.865
Well, then I could
still be out there,

28:20.949 --> 28:23.284
thriving under
the New World Order. I--

28:23.368 --> 28:24.285
[breathes sharply]

28:25.620 --> 28:28.832
Look, I go into Cloverton
nearly every day

28:28.915 --> 28:30.583
and I'm yet to see
another survivor.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.836
I'm sorry.

28:35.505 --> 28:38.133
Vic, take a walk with me.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.427
Something I gotta
show you.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.449
[all] What the fuck?

29:03.825 --> 29:07.162
Larry? Keeg?

29:07.245 --> 29:09.372
[sighs]
What the hell is goin'
on here?

29:14.752 --> 29:15.670
Hello!

29:20.842 --> 29:21.801
Rita?

29:23.803 --> 29:27.056
I know what this is.
It's a death hoop.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.976
Rita Vivian Farr,

29:30.059 --> 29:35.190
I know what you're doing,
and I want you to stop
this instant.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.151
[grunts]
You're not fooling anyone,
you know.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.571
This is the exact same
blocking we did in the picture,

29:41.654 --> 29:44.616
The Return of Ghost Gal,
Ghost Gal's Gal Pal.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.409
[sighs] Pish.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.411
I was hoping
you would have forgotten.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.333
Well, what do you want?

29:53.416 --> 29:55.460
-For starters--
-They're dead.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.795
Everyone's dead.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.089
I see.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.883
[breathes deeply]
Let me guess.

30:01.966 --> 30:06.888
I had a carefully
well laid out plan
and nobody followed it.

30:07.805 --> 30:10.058
Not exactly.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.060
[Rita] It was Rouge.

30:12.143 --> 30:15.355
Rouge betrayed us
like she did
the Sisterhood of Dada.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.564
No.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.734
It turns out we were
about as good

30:19.817 --> 30:24.447
at being a team leader
as we were at being
a high school drama teacher.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.533
How can that be?

30:26.616 --> 30:31.204
I... I... We have
an undefeated record.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.958
It's complicated.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.210
[clears throat]
There's a lot to unpack.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.758
Tell me everything.

30:43.841 --> 30:47.929
Well, are you going to talk
or just continue staring

30:48.012 --> 30:51.015
out the window
like a catatonic tuna fish?

30:51.099 --> 30:55.061
Are you really in such denial
that you can't deduce
what happened?

30:55.144 --> 30:59.440
Perhaps you're too much
of a coward
to own up to your actions.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.526
Cut the shit, H.

31:01.609 --> 31:05.572
Your pathological arrogance
got the girl killed.

31:05.655 --> 31:09.576
No. In my time
the girl is still alive.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.119
I haven't done anything yet.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.496
It was you.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.166
Was that a different clan
of cataclysmic misfits

31:17.250 --> 31:19.127
you darkened
my doorstep with?

31:19.210 --> 31:20.545
But that's impossible.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.424
-The girl is--
-Your primary concern.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.803
Guess again, sister.

31:28.886 --> 31:31.472
If you were really interested
in protecting her,

31:31.556 --> 31:33.474
you would have taken her
far from this place

31:33.558 --> 31:36.686
and these people right after
you seized control from Jane.

31:36.769 --> 31:38.521
But no,

31:38.605 --> 31:43.151
you were more interested
in emotionally dissecting
your little lab rats,

31:44.569 --> 31:45.737
and now Kay is dead.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.095
[whispering] Peace...

32:12.430 --> 32:13.389
[muttering]

32:13.473 --> 32:15.433
[whispering] Continued on A-13.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.144
A-13?

32:20.938 --> 32:23.191
[muttering]

32:24.525 --> 32:25.902
[whispers] Where is A-13?

32:36.120 --> 32:36.954
Oh.

32:44.253 --> 32:45.171
What the fuck?

32:45.254 --> 32:47.465
[muttering indistinctly]

32:54.263 --> 32:58.726
So, you can't, uh,
fuck with the sex ghosts
at all?

32:59.811 --> 33:01.312
Sure, sure.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.939
I mean, not literally.

33:03.022 --> 33:08.111
I mostly do a lot of watching
and commenting.

33:08.194 --> 33:11.280
But that's not really
what you wanna ask me
about, is it?

33:13.991 --> 33:14.909
No.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.371
-Are they--
-Clara and Rory are fine.

33:18.454 --> 33:22.250
They took Mille's dad's boat
out on the Atlantic
and are safe and sound.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.501
[Cliff] Really?

33:23.584 --> 33:24.502
No.

33:27.213 --> 33:28.131
Tell me.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.382
Bro, you don't want to know.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.386
Can you at least tell me
what happened to me?

33:34.804 --> 33:36.723
Parkinson's got us.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.307
[Cliff] Really?

33:38.391 --> 33:41.144
Bro, [chuckling]
you do not wanna know.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.770
[shouting] Listen, bro!

33:42.854 --> 33:45.857
Either you start talking
or I'll make it
my life's mission

33:45.940 --> 33:48.317
to figure out how to rip off
your ghost head

33:48.401 --> 33:50.319
and shit down your ghost neck.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.864
Which would entail
a side mission of figuring out
how to take a shit,

33:52.947 --> 33:55.867
but so help me,
I will fucking do it!

33:55.950 --> 33:57.201
[chuckling] Okay.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.496
Okay, okay, okay. Jesus.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.249
You want the truth?
Here it is.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.293
Your perfect grandson, Rory,

34:06.711 --> 34:08.004
you never get to touch him.

34:10.339 --> 34:15.553
Because I died before
I could get to Florida?

34:15.636 --> 34:18.514
Bro, you do not
want to know.

34:44.874 --> 34:45.917
Oh, there you are.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.129
My God, we're dead.

34:51.964 --> 34:52.965
Hey!

34:55.176 --> 34:56.010
Hello?

34:57.762 --> 34:59.430
Yeah, that tracks.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.558
Future Keeg.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.480
Future Keeg, release.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.735
Hey, whe...
where's Keeg, Larry?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.530
Larry, please.

35:15.613 --> 35:16.572
Where is he?

35:17.615 --> 35:19.325
Keeg doesn't
live here anymore.

35:20.868 --> 35:21.994
Wha... what
happened to him?

35:23.120 --> 35:24.372
What the hell did you do?

35:26.666 --> 35:29.460
Hey! I'm talking to you.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.379
Larry, I'm talking to you!

35:31.462 --> 35:33.548
[energy pulsating]

35:42.807 --> 35:44.058
[power surging]

35:46.519 --> 35:47.812
Oh, thank God.

35:47.895 --> 35:49.772
[chuckling] Look at you!

35:49.856 --> 35:51.065
You're all grown up.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.901
How you doing, buddy?

35:53.985 --> 35:56.487
And what does he mean,
"You don't live here anymore?"

35:59.532 --> 36:01.409
Huh? You look...
You can talk to me.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.039
What is going on here?

36:08.332 --> 36:09.208
[energy pulsating]

36:09.292 --> 36:10.084
[grunts]

36:10.167 --> 36:11.669
[breathing heavily]

36:15.965 --> 36:17.758
Hey, what's happening?

36:17.842 --> 36:19.051
What are you doing to him?

36:19.135 --> 36:21.220
[ominous music playing]

36:22.680 --> 36:24.265
[energy pulsating]

36:26.684 --> 36:27.602
[power surging]

36:27.685 --> 36:28.728
Whoa!

36:30.980 --> 36:32.315
[pants]

36:32.398 --> 36:34.025
What the hell
did he say to you?

36:37.695 --> 36:38.529
[thuds]

36:53.669 --> 36:54.545
[exhales]

36:59.050 --> 37:02.428
Oh, my fuck sticks.

37:02.511 --> 37:05.264
[Vic grunting]

37:05.348 --> 37:07.892
-[gasps] Shitting hell!
-[grunting]

37:07.975 --> 37:09.018
-[groans]
-[panting]

37:09.101 --> 37:10.353
He's gonna steal
the time machine.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.816
Sooner or later,
if they don't get eaten,

37:15.900 --> 37:18.027
they're gonna make
their way here.

37:18.110 --> 37:21.489
If you all keep them occupied,
I'll double back
and take Shipley.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.534
I may be in the minority,

37:25.618 --> 37:29.872
but perhaps we should give
our past selves a chance.

37:29.956 --> 37:33.751
Maybe with our guidance,
they can avert this
terrible future.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.804
[all laughing]

37:44.887 --> 37:48.849
I can't believe you got
through that with
a straight face!

37:48.933 --> 37:50.726
[all laughing]

37:50.810 --> 37:53.854
You're trusting those morons
to right the future.
Could you imagine?

37:53.938 --> 37:54.939
[continues laughing]

37:56.440 --> 37:58.526
-[wind blowing]
-[footsteps approaching]

38:12.164 --> 38:13.416
[Vic] Going somewhere?

38:18.963 --> 38:20.047
I don't want to fight you.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.465
I bet you don't, old man.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.430
Or talking is also good.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.057
This is for the best.
For all of us.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.475
How is stealing
the time machine

38:31.559 --> 38:33.686
instead of telling us
how to stop this better?

38:33.769 --> 38:35.980
Look, you're just gonna
fuck it up.

38:36.063 --> 38:38.566
The way I see it,
we haven't fucked up
anything yet.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.068
It was you all who caused
this future, not us.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.571
If you know how to avoid this,
then you need to tell me.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.031
There's no point.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.241
Where you're at right now,
you're not gonna hear me.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.577
Where am I at?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.162
You still think
you're on-plan?

38:52.747 --> 38:54.623
-You just don't get it--
-Don't get what?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.710
[Rita] What about us?

38:57.793 --> 38:59.712
Are we in a clear headspace?

38:59.795 --> 39:01.881
[Zombie Butts growling]

39:04.008 --> 39:05.259
[growling, snarling]

39:05.342 --> 39:07.511
You better be. They're here.

39:08.220 --> 39:09.430
[growling]

39:09.513 --> 39:10.848
[crashing]

39:12.516 --> 39:13.476
[yelping]

39:17.521 --> 39:18.939
[Cliff] Fuck these
fucking Butts.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.776
We kicked their asses once,
we can do it again!

39:21.859 --> 39:23.944
That's exactly what you said
20 years ago,

39:24.028 --> 39:26.364
When a Butt cracked your head
like an egg and ate you.

39:26.447 --> 39:30.284
Thank you. Finally,
someone tells me how I die.

39:30.367 --> 39:32.578
[snarling]

39:32.661 --> 39:34.497
[roaring]

39:34.580 --> 39:35.456
[growling]

39:35.539 --> 39:36.791
-[grunts]
-[yelping]

39:36.874 --> 39:39.168
Careful.
Don't let them bite you.

39:39.251 --> 39:40.836
We can't win this.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.796
We have to go.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.881
No! Not until he talks.

39:43.964 --> 39:46.217
I love a fight as much
as the next robot...

39:46.300 --> 39:48.219
-[snarling]
-But, this is nuts.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.138
-[growling]
-[grunting]

39:51.222 --> 39:53.015
[Madame Rouge]
Dr. H is right.
Let's get out of here.

39:55.309 --> 39:56.560
-[Zombie Butt snarling]
-[gun fires]

39:56.644 --> 39:57.603
[Vic] We're bugging out.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.480
Come with us.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.940
Help us fight the future.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.817
Hell, no.
I'd rather be ravaged by
Zombie Butts

40:02.900 --> 40:04.485
than revisit
that point of my life.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.780
Then I'm not going, either.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.574
Absolutely not, Victor.
It's suicide.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.828
Maybe your jellyfish
wasn't on tight enough?

40:13.911 --> 40:16.580
But you can't
do shit, remember?

40:16.664 --> 40:18.332
You don't have shit
to fight with.

40:18.415 --> 40:19.583
[blade swishing]

40:19.667 --> 40:20.501
Here!

40:22.294 --> 40:23.546
Booyah!

40:23.629 --> 40:24.839
-[gun fires]
-[both grunting]

40:24.922 --> 40:26.382
-[squelching]
-[gun firing]

40:26.465 --> 40:28.050
[Zombie Butts growling]

40:28.134 --> 40:29.343
[Silas] Boys!

40:29.426 --> 40:31.846
Stop this nonsense!
Immediately!

40:32.930 --> 40:33.889
-Dad?
-Dad?

40:36.642 --> 40:38.686
Call me Pop-Pop, please.

40:40.729 --> 40:41.814
Wait. [grunts]

40:41.897 --> 40:42.731
No!

40:49.280 --> 40:50.364
[whooshes]

40:50.447 --> 40:51.282
[Vic] No!

40:52.658 --> 40:53.659
Why did you do that?

40:53.742 --> 40:54.743
[Zombie Butts thudding on door]

40:54.827 --> 40:56.287
Okay, we're going, everybody.

40:58.831 --> 40:59.832
[breathing heavily]

41:02.460 --> 41:04.128
[Shipley firing up]

41:05.754 --> 41:07.464
[whooshing]

41:10.342 --> 41:12.928
-The launch sequence
has already been initiated.
-[grunts]

41:13.012 --> 41:14.263
It won't open.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.098
[grunting]

41:16.891 --> 41:18.434
You can't save him, Vic.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.146
[Zombie Butts snarling]

41:23.314 --> 41:25.900
[roaring, snarling]

41:32.781 --> 41:35.576
[Future Vic screaming]

41:35.659 --> 41:36.660
[Zombie Butts snarling]

41:39.205 --> 41:40.831
[Future Vic yelling]

41:42.041 --> 41:44.084
[rumbling]

41:47.379 --> 41:48.964
[whooshing]

41:55.804 --> 41:56.972
[whooshing]

41:59.391 --> 42:00.935
[whirring]

42:47.773 --> 42:50.693
[Vic]
"You can't have it all."

42:54.863 --> 42:56.240
[energy pulsating]

42:56.323 --> 42:58.325
Easy, buddy. Easy.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.326
[sighs]

43:00.244 --> 43:01.745
Please.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.455
-Look.
-[energy pulsating]

43:03.539 --> 43:05.708
Your other dad would write me
a note sometimes.

43:07.084 --> 43:08.294
Could you try to do that?

43:09.253 --> 43:10.838
[power surging]

43:10.921 --> 43:14.341
Can you please just tell
what future Keeg showed you?

43:15.676 --> 43:16.635
Was it about me?

43:20.055 --> 43:22.474
What did you do
to fuck this one up, Trainor?

43:24.059 --> 43:24.935
[sighs]

43:26.729 --> 43:28.480
[Dr. Harrison] Did you see?

43:28.564 --> 43:29.815
[Jane] Every hairy detail.

43:31.650 --> 43:33.360
I don't know what to say.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.529
Good. Because I do.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.990
You were right.

43:38.073 --> 43:40.117
I was hiding out
in Kay's memories

43:40.200 --> 43:43.746
because being Primary is hard
and it's fucking draining.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.372
And I needed a break.

43:45.456 --> 43:46.915
But after what I saw
in the future,

43:46.999 --> 43:49.626
I am going back up right now
and so help me,

43:49.710 --> 43:52.671
I will chuck you face-first,
into the fucking well if you--

43:52.755 --> 43:53.964
[gasps]

43:57.426 --> 44:00.220
[softly] Kay.
Where have you been?

44:02.598 --> 44:04.475
What happened
to Dr. H?

44:04.558 --> 44:06.060
Don't follow me.

44:06.143 --> 44:07.102
Listen to me, please--

44:07.186 --> 44:08.687
[gasps]

44:28.916 --> 44:30.376
What the fuck?

44:44.723 --> 44:45.599
[knock on door]

44:46.975 --> 44:47.810
[sighs]

44:53.649 --> 44:55.776
[knock on door]

44:57.319 --> 44:58.153
Oh. [chuckles]

44:58.237 --> 44:59.363
That's unusual.

45:00.197 --> 45:01.281
[whispering] 'Kay.

45:01.365 --> 45:03.575
Uh, do you think
it was random seeing

45:03.659 --> 45:06.453
Isabel Feathers
in the time stream?

45:06.537 --> 45:08.831
[clicks tongue]
I'm not sure, do you?

45:08.914 --> 45:10.666
[Madame Rouge]
I'm not sure either.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.501
Might be worth finding out.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.257
You're not leaving anymore,
are you?

45:20.509 --> 45:22.428
Given what we've seen
in the future

45:22.511 --> 45:26.557
it's... probably for the best?

45:26.640 --> 45:27.850
[gasps]

45:27.933 --> 45:30.811
Well, isn't this just
the shitty cherry on top

45:30.894 --> 45:33.439
of a shitty sundae
made of shit?

45:33.522 --> 45:34.440
Okay.

45:35.732 --> 45:36.567
[door slams]

45:39.736 --> 45:40.863
Think that went well.

45:44.116 --> 45:46.743
[Vic] You can't have it all.

45:47.911 --> 45:48.954
Fuck that.

45:51.999 --> 45:53.041
[exhales]

46:04.928 --> 46:05.888
[sighs]

46:10.517 --> 46:18.066
Rory, I am gonna come
touch your perfect,
squishy tush.

46:18.150 --> 46:22.738
But, first I gotta stop
the Buttpocalypse.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.533
But I promise you.

46:26.617 --> 46:31.330
I will not touch a single thing
with my new hand
before I get to you.

46:34.791 --> 46:38.086
Until then, fuck you,
the future.

46:50.849 --> 46:52.100
This better be good, Bunbury.

46:52.184 --> 46:54.102
I was in the middle
of Graham Norton.

46:54.186 --> 46:57.564
[squeaking]

47:02.361 --> 47:03.529
[chuckles]

47:03.612 --> 47:05.906
Can't be serious
with this shit.

47:05.989 --> 47:08.617
I mean, it's a stupid hoax,
he's not real.

47:09.368 --> 47:12.829
[squeaking]

47:12.913 --> 47:15.874
I bought you the wrong bedding
one time.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.834
When you gonna get over it?

47:17.918 --> 47:19.962
[squeaking]

47:25.175 --> 47:27.636
Can we, maybe just,
get back to the photo?

47:31.557 --> 47:33.600
A... a thousand apologies,
Bunbury.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.394
[squeaking]

47:38.063 --> 47:41.608
Prophecy only mentioned
the Butts.

47:41.692 --> 47:45.571
Now, if this is real,
really, really, real,

47:45.654 --> 47:47.239
it can mean
only one thing.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.701
We're well and truly fucked.
