Tom! What are you doing here?

10:08.820 --> 10:09.760
Tammy sent me a photo.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.060
Oh shit! That's Trent Latham!

10:13.260 --> 10:14.660
- Trent Latham?
- Trent Latham?

10:14.860 --> 10:15.980
Which one's Trent again?

10:16.180 --> 10:17.340
[screams] Trent!

10:17.540 --> 10:19.620
Vanessa! No! Ugh!

10:19.820 --> 10:20.980
Vanessa! No! Stop!

10:21.180 --> 10:23.140
No, no. No, no, no, Vanessa!
You can't!

10:23.340 --> 10:25.100
- [grunts]
- Ow!

10:25.300 --> 10:26.420
Trent!

10:26.620 --> 10:28.300
- Mine!
- Tammy, no!

10:28.500 --> 10:29.520
Trent!

10:30.840 --> 10:31.780
[inhales]

10:31.980 --> 10:35.160
[screams] Baby!

10:36.280 --> 10:38.860
Vanessa, I just need to
ask you a few questions

10:39.060 --> 10:41.780
before the lead detective
arrives tomorrow.

10:41.980 --> 10:44.340
- Was there any time...
- Sorry. [whispers] Sorry.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.540
The bakery ran out of breakfast brioche,
so I got you fruit toast,.

10:46.740 --> 10:47.540
- OK.
- Is that OK?

10:47.740 --> 10:49.100
Alright. Yep, thank you, love.
Thanks.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.140
It's watermelon and mint.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.780
- OK, thanks. Thanks, Cath.
- Sorry!

10:51.980 --> 10:53.340
- No, that's...
- Didn't get you guys anything.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.660
That's really OK, Cath.
Thank you. Alright.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.460
Um...

10:57.660 --> 11:01.380
Uh, Vanessa, it's important that we
figure out your husband's movements.

11:01.580 --> 11:03.500
- Were you with Trent last night?
- Yes, at home.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.220
OK, and what did your night entail?

11:05.420 --> 11:07.940
We ate tuna mornay,
watched Ninja Warrior,

11:08.140 --> 11:10.580
and then at 11pm we went to bed...
[sniffles]

11:10.780 --> 11:11.900
...and made love.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.020
Right, and can anyone verify that?

11:14.220 --> 11:16.380
My son, Dolph.
He probably heard, didn't you?

11:16.580 --> 11:17.880
[inhales shakily]

11:19.040 --> 11:20.860
Uh...

11:21.060 --> 11:22.300
OK, and, um...

11:22.500 --> 11:24.340
Did you hear Trent
leave the house at all?

11:24.540 --> 11:25.940
No, I already told you,

11:26.140 --> 11:28.060
I woke up this morning
and Trent was just gone.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.780
I thought he was at footy training.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.780
At 7am.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.740
When will the real detective arrive?

11:32.940 --> 11:35.420
Ah, shortly. Would Trent have
taken his mobile with him, Vanessa?

11:35.620 --> 11:36.980
Am I gonna have to
say all this to him as well?

11:37.180 --> 11:38.300
If you could just answer the question?

11:38.500 --> 11:39.740
Of course he would have
had his phone on him.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.840
Did you check his pockets?

11:43.720 --> 11:46.340
He was naked. Oh, my God!

11:46.540 --> 11:48.760
[sobs]

11:50.560 --> 11:52.980
- Ah... um...
- [slurping]

11:53.180 --> 11:55.340
Trent went to
the Beast Factory gym yesterday,

11:55.540 --> 11:58.100
- but it was closed to the public...
- Yes, for deodorising.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.140
OK, and what about his brother, Gavin?

12:00.340 --> 12:02.220
It's my understand that
he co-owns the gym.

12:02.420 --> 12:06.900
Was he helping out his brother
with the... to deodorise the...

12:07.100 --> 12:08.420
No, Gavin was down at the harbour,

12:08.620 --> 12:11.220
putting decals on the boat
for their new business, Pro-Bro.

12:11.420 --> 12:13.060
[sniffles]

12:13.260 --> 12:14.980
It's protein.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.680
For bros. [sobs]

12:19.160 --> 12:22.420
[sobs]

12:22.620 --> 12:25.740
Vanessa, was Trent involved in
any illegal activity?

12:25.940 --> 12:27.220
No!

12:27.420 --> 12:30.060
Trent was a pillar of this community.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.100
His family are a Deadloch dynasty.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.300
They've been here since the '60s.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.320
I mean, everybody in Deadloch
loved Trent, didn't they?

12:39.760 --> 12:40.960
Didn't they?

12:42.480 --> 12:44.860
[sobs]

12:45.060 --> 12:47.880
[slurps]

13:01.760 --> 13:05.340
Oh, Sven, we need to check all
the trail cameras along the beachfront

13:05.540 --> 13:07.500
for vision from last night.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.460
Hopefully there's one that
hasn't been smashed in.

13:09.660 --> 13:13.660
[Sven]<i> Yeah, absolutely.</i>
<i>Now who do I delegate that to?</i>

13:13.860 --> 13:15.380
Ah, yourself, Sven.

13:15.580 --> 13:18.660
You go down there
and you look at the cameras yourself.

13:18.860 --> 13:22.300
<i>Oh, right, right, right, right.</i>
<i>OK, hang tight, peeps. Bye!</i>

13:22.500 --> 13:23.860
[hangs up]

13:24.060 --> 13:25.460
Any word on the autopsy?

13:25.660 --> 13:27.740
The forensic pathologist
can't do it today.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.200
He's on a bike ride.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.040
Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.820
About fuckin' time you cunts showed up!

13:53.020 --> 13:54.420
Been calling youse all morning.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.140
Some cunt stole me copper wire.

13:56.340 --> 13:58.740
Got six grand worth of crays
going off in the deep freeze.

13:58.940 --> 14:00.340
We're not here about
the copper wire, Gavin.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.100
Oh, this is about fuckin' Sharelle
and that restraining order?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.820
How many times I gotta tell you, OK?

14:06.020 --> 14:07.460
It is not my fault

14:07.660 --> 14:10.180
if the only Deadloch pub
that I haven't been banned from

14:10.380 --> 14:11.540
is the one that she works at.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.900
- Gavin, listen.
- What?

14:14.100 --> 14:17.680
Your brother's body showed up
on Deadloch Beach this morning.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.100
[shouts] Fuck!

14:24.300 --> 14:26.220
Oh...

14:26.420 --> 14:27.700
Oh, fuck!

14:27.900 --> 14:29.540
Are you shitting me?
You're pulling my dick, aren't ya?

14:29.740 --> 14:31.880
No, I'm not doing that.
I'm very sorry, Gavin.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.700
Fuck!

14:33.900 --> 14:34.940
Oh...

14:35.140 --> 14:36.940
Well, I know who fuckin' did it.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.500
It was fuckin' bitch Mayor.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.580
Or it was that fuckin'
singing bitch on the bike.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.260
Or that fuckin' dyke lesbian chef bitch.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.220
She said she wanted to
kill me and Trent heaps.

14:45.420 --> 14:48.300
And she said she wanted to kill
fuckin' Sam, and probably Jimmy too.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.880
Oh, she's a fuckin' man-hater!

14:56.520 --> 14:58.900
When was the last time
you saw Trent, Gavin?

14:59.100 --> 15:01.300
- I didn't fuckin' do it!
- That is not what I'm asking.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.060
Yesterday I was doing the boat,

15:03.260 --> 15:04.980
and yesterday night I was here
with me mate Jimmy.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.680
Oi, Jimmy, get out here!

15:09.120 --> 15:10.200
What?

15:11.560 --> 15:13.400
Fuck, mate... Trent's dead.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.220
Fuck!

15:16.420 --> 15:18.460
- I was here with you last night,
wasn't I Jimmy?
- No, don't answer that!

15:18.660 --> 15:19.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah, see?
- No, don't answer that!

15:20.100 --> 15:21.220
You shut up.
I was fuckin' here, wasn't I?

15:21.420 --> 15:23.840
- I said yeah!
- Alright, well, fuck off, Jimmy!

15:30.840 --> 15:32.660
What happened to
your windscreen, Gavin?

15:32.860 --> 15:36.140
[mimics] What happened to your
windscreen? Are you fuckin' serious?
I've told you this a million times.

15:36.340 --> 15:39.300
The Chinese mafia did that to me.
They're fuckin' after me.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.660
Or it was Sharelle.
Fuckin' charge her too.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.180
I know what you fuckin' femmos
think of me, alright? I see it.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.060
But it's a double standard,
'cause I'm the victim here.

15:46.260 --> 15:48.420
I'll ask you to stop pacing,
if possible, Gavin.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.720
- Have you seen Trent's mobile?
- Nuh.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.140
Any idea where it might be?

15:53.340 --> 15:54.240
Trent's dead.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.200
I loved that cunt like a brother.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.780
He was your brother.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.560
Fuck! My brother!

16:24.760 --> 16:26.660
- [bell dings]
- Hey! Hey!

16:26.860 --> 16:28.040
Claire!

16:33.000 --> 16:36.380
[Abby] Ma'am, Cath called to remind you
about Skye's menu tasting tonight.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.380
- Uh-huh.
- I think she thinks I'm your PA.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.500
- [door opens]
- Did you forget?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.460
- Ah, no, no.
- It starts in five minutes.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.020
- Of course not. Uh-huh.

16:44.220 --> 16:47.340
It should be illegal to ride a bike
at night with no lights.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.300
It is illegal.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.420
- Forensics are just, uh, packing up.
- Right.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.700
Hey, look at this board!
Did you go to Officeworks?

16:53.900 --> 16:55.220
I did.

16:55.420 --> 16:56.820
Did forensics find anything?

16:57.020 --> 16:58.140
Ah, nothing, no.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.620
No clothing, no fabric fibres,
no DNA, no footprints.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.260
- Hey, don't do that!
- Oh, this is cerulean!

17:04.460 --> 17:05.380
I love cerulean.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.740
Sorry, Sven, you're saying they
didn't find any evidence anywhere?

17:07.940 --> 17:10.700
- Ah, well, they did find more nangs.
- Great.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.700
How'd you go with the trail cameras?

17:12.900 --> 17:13.980
All smashed to bits.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.460
I think because of the nangs.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.660
What about the cameras at the harbour?

17:17.860 --> 17:21.220
Yes, I didn't check them
because I wasn't aware they existed.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.340
- They do.
- [phone buzzes]

17:23.540 --> 17:26.180
[Abby] Was that Cath?
She messaged me too.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.440
Yeah.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.400
I really have to...

17:34.280 --> 17:36.620
OK. I'm off.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.900
I've still gotta clean
the penis graffiti off the school desks

17:39.100 --> 17:40.980
before the Carnage Bay cops
arrive tomorrow morning

17:41.180 --> 17:42.180
for the briefing.

17:42.380 --> 17:43.580
But I could finish
the rest of the board.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.100
Don't touch the board!

17:46.300 --> 17:47.200
OK.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.540
[gentle clinking]

18:18.740 --> 18:21.040
[laughter, indistinct conversation]

18:51.280 --> 18:52.640
[shutter clicks]

19:44.440 --> 19:45.620
Evening, Jimmy.

19:45.820 --> 19:48.060
Yeah, good, thanks.

19:48.260 --> 19:52.140
You got any idea why that
security camera's smashed?

19:52.340 --> 19:53.420
Dunno.

19:53.620 --> 19:54.760
Birds?

20:00.960 --> 20:05.700
Ah, this vessel you're on
belongs to Phil McGangus, correct?

20:05.900 --> 20:07.300
Depends who's asking.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.700
Ah, me.
It's me who's asking, Jimmy.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.320
- Yeah, it is.
- Mm-hm.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.220
Hey, don't call him.
It's 9pm! I'll cop it!

20:18.420 --> 20:20.900
I'm gonna follow this up
tomorrow, Jimmy.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.980
Follow up what, but?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.440
What, but?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.980
- [siren wails]
- [man]<i> VKB, Oscar 23.</i>

20:29.180 --> 20:30.660
[man 2]<i> Go ahead, Oscar 23.</i>

20:30.860 --> 20:32.460
[man 1]<i> Show this unit</i>

20:34.900 --> 20:37.580
<i>Also show the Forensic Unit</i>
<i>and Mortuary Ambulance following us in.</i>

20:37.780 --> 20:39.460
[man 2]<i> Roger that.</i>

20:39.660 --> 20:42.000
[ominous choral music plays]

20:49.000 --> 20:50.660
To Trent!

20:50.860 --> 20:52.080
[all] To Trent.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.560

21:14.960 --> 21:15.980

21:23.480 --> 21:24.880
Going the wrong way.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.460
Hey!

21:27.660 --> 21:29.620
You're going the wrong way!

21:29.820 --> 21:31.340
Hobart's the other way!

21:31.540 --> 21:33.160
- [brakes squeal]
- [music stops]

21:42.320 --> 21:43.780
- [beeping]
- Yeah, wait there, wait there.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.380
- Yeah, you're clear now.
- Back, back, back.

21:45.580 --> 21:46.620
Yeah come back, mate.
Back, back.

21:46.820 --> 21:49.200

21:53.760 --> 21:56.220
[sobs]

21:56.420 --> 21:58.160

22:04.480 --> 22:06.880
- To Trent.
- [all] Trent.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.280
Lace out, boys.
This is for you, coach!

22:27.400 --> 22:29.440
Fuck, Ronny. You hit Coach!

22:32.640 --> 22:35.400
[indistinct chatter]

22:45.560 --> 22:47.220
Good morning.

22:47.420 --> 22:48.380
Where's the detective?

22:48.580 --> 22:51.140
Palpably not here.
Let's get started.

22:51.340 --> 22:54.380
- Trent Latham was found at 5.30...
- Hey, what's the wi-fi password?

22:54.580 --> 22:55.780
Ah, I can answer that.

22:55.980 --> 22:58.580
It's lower case, all one word,
'three little pigs'.

22:58.780 --> 23:02.700
Trent Latham was found at 5.35am
on Deadloch Beach.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.940
He was naked
and without any personal effects.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.740
So far there are no witnesses
and no suspect.

23:07.940 --> 23:11.140
Autopsy is pending,
so cause of death is still unknown.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.660
Was he strangled?

23:12.860 --> 23:15.180
That is for the forensic pathologist
to decide, Constable.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.460
I reckon Gavin did it.
He's a loose unit.

23:17.660 --> 23:19.700
A solid centre-half forward
back in the day, though.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.660
Like I said, we have no suspects.
Moving on.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.420
You're on digital,
you are on documentation.

23:25.620 --> 23:28.460
Abby, how did you go getting the footage
from Phil McGangus's boat?

23:28.660 --> 23:30.980
- He hung up on me.
- OK, perfect.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.860
Right, first things first...

23:33.060 --> 23:36.300
Oh, fuck me! It's colder
than a witch's tit out there.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.420
Ooh. Oh!

23:38.620 --> 23:40.420
Oh! Hey. G'day.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.500
- Ah, I'm sorry. You can't be here
- G'day. G'day.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.980
- Sorry, you're not...
- Ah, Sven, can you...

23:45.180 --> 23:47.900
- G'day, g'day, g'day, g'day.
- Excuse me, this is a restricted area.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.940
Hang on a second.
My ears are blocked from the plane.

23:50.140 --> 23:51.780
[inhales] Oh!

23:51.980 --> 23:53.980
- OK.
- Better. OK! [claps]

23:54.180 --> 23:56.500
Detective Eddie Redcliffe
is my name.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.060
I am from Darwin.

23:58.260 --> 24:01.240
I'm running the show and I need a Coke.
Who wants to action that?

24:03.040 --> 24:04.460
- Yep.
- Thank you.

24:04.660 --> 24:05.980
- OK.
- Ah, Detective...

24:06.180 --> 24:09.260
I am Senior Sergeant Collins,
Deadloch Police.

24:09.460 --> 24:12.180
I didn't expect you to be
a w... w... arriving,

24:12.380 --> 24:16.780
uh, when you did arrive, early,
and I started a briefing.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.380
Ripper. Well, I'm here now,

24:18.580 --> 24:20.980
so... resume regular programming,
Sergeant.

24:21.180 --> 24:23.020
Senior. Ah, it's Senior Sergeant.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.500
But I actually used to be
a detective, Detective.

24:25.700 --> 24:28.060
Oh, yeah. One of them, are ya?

24:28.260 --> 24:31.980
- Alright, dead man in Dead Lake.
- Ah...

24:32.180 --> 24:34.340
- Loch. Loch.
- Yep, whatever.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.460
Right, let's get this thing
over with. Now...

24:36.660 --> 24:40.860
the first 24 hours of an investigation
are crucial so...

24:41.060 --> 24:44.300
how long has shrivel dick
been dead for? Big Eyes?

24:44.500 --> 24:47.180
Um, he was discovered
27 hours ago, ma'am.

24:47.380 --> 24:48.700
Ah, right.

24:48.900 --> 24:51.300
Well, you've fucked that up already,
haven't ya?

24:51.500 --> 24:53.780
- Er...
- Ah, not to worry. Jason Statham.

24:53.980 --> 24:55.820
Trent Latham.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.140
What do we know about him? Big Eyes.

24:57.340 --> 24:58.180
Um...

24:58.380 --> 24:59.780
Don't look at her.
Don't look at her.

24:59.980 --> 25:04.220
Ah, Trent was... is...
was Deadloch born and bred.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.700
He was the boys' football coach.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.540
He owned the Beast Factory
14-hour gym

25:09.740 --> 25:13.380
and he lived upstairs with
his wife, Vanessa, and son, Dolph.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.620
He was a self-described
fitness entrepreneur.

25:15.820 --> 25:17.580
En... Entrepr...

25:17.780 --> 25:19.660
- Um, he...
- Keep going, yeah. Keep going.

25:19.860 --> 25:22.180
He used to work at the sawmill
before it got shut down.

25:22.380 --> 25:24.700
The night he died he had tuna mornay...

25:24.900 --> 25:25.700
Why?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.060
His parents are dead.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.100
He spat at me at a traffic stop once.

25:29.300 --> 25:31.660
- I think he just didn't
see me, though...
- Detective, all of the relevant...

25:31.860 --> 25:33.160
Right, cause of death!

25:34.200 --> 25:35.580
Well, that's easy.
I mean, look at the neck.

25:35.780 --> 25:39.820
It is ringbarked.
But... how did it happen, you know?

25:40.020 --> 25:41.540
We have some options. Yeah.

25:41.740 --> 25:42.860
Maybe did it to himself.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.300
You know, maybe it was a bit of
one of these?

25:45.500 --> 25:48.060
You know, one of those...
Oh! You know?

25:48.260 --> 25:49.380
[mimics choking]

25:49.580 --> 25:51.540
"Oh, it's too hard!
Oh, no, it's too soft!"

25:51.740 --> 25:54.580
You know?
Very popular way to go.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.700
What do you reckon, Sarge?
Bit of a tug-gone-wrong?

25:56.900 --> 25:58.660
Hmm.

25:58.860 --> 26:00.620
I think that...

26:00.820 --> 26:03.340
autoerotic...

26:03.540 --> 26:05.220
asphyxiation can't be, uh...

26:05.420 --> 26:06.940
conclusively ruled out
until after the autopsy.

26:07.140 --> 26:08.900
But I feel that
from all the evidence that...

26:09.100 --> 26:11.660
I'm tickling your sack. [laughs]

26:11.860 --> 26:13.060
He was strangled. So...

26:13.260 --> 26:16.340
It's a small town,
he's a good-looking bloke.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.620
He probably had a busy dick
and that's what got him whacked.

26:19.820 --> 26:20.900
These the suspects?

26:21.100 --> 26:22.780
Ah, no, that is Trent's family.

26:22.980 --> 26:24.220
Think you need
a homicide refresher, mate.

26:24.420 --> 26:25.380
It's always the family, right?

26:25.580 --> 26:26.820
Uh... uh...

26:27.020 --> 26:30.260
Right, who is the psycho
with the 25-page rap sheet?

26:30.460 --> 26:31.860
That is Gavin Lathan,

26:32.060 --> 26:34.220
Trent Latham's brother
and business partner...

26:34.420 --> 26:37.180
and I doubt that he has
the nuance to pull this off.

26:37.380 --> 26:39.540
Gavin Latham, look at the mug!

I'll have a hoon on that. Thank you.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.060
Cath dropped off your lunch, too.

27:00.260 --> 27:01.420
- I don't want that now.
- It's your lunch.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.940
- I don't want it now.
- She dropped it off.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.780
- Can you please put it...
- Alright, so psycho killer did it.

27:05.980 --> 27:08.980
He killed his brother, so let's
get him in for questioning ASAP.

27:09.180 --> 27:13.300
I want to get this thing wrapped up
in record-o time-o.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.420
Alright! Fly, my piggies! Fly, fly, fly!

27:15.620 --> 27:17.460
I've got an autopsy to get to.

27:17.660 --> 27:21.420
Um, ah, the autopsy hasn't been
confirmed yet, Detective.

27:21.620 --> 27:23.180
Mm! Um, yeah, it has.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.660
They, ah, they called me direct.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.740
Right, well, I'll accompany you, then.

27:27.940 --> 27:28.980
Mmm!

27:29.180 --> 27:30.380
No, no, you're right, Sarge.

27:30.580 --> 27:34.380
You've probably got a stolen wheelbarrow
to find or something.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.860
Big cop's in town now.
Alright, Big Eyes!

27:37.060 --> 27:38.540
Come with me. I need a driver.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.020
- Um...
- Come on!

27:40.220 --> 27:42.060
- Keep me updated.
- Yes, ma'am.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.700
Sorry, ma'am.

27:43.900 --> 27:47.800
Dulce, Kevin the seal
is back on the foreshore.

27:49.080 --> 27:52.720
So who would I delegate that to,
would you say?

27:54.120 --> 27:59.060
I can take that, Sven.
That would be an absolute honour.

27:59.260 --> 28:02.620
Wonderful. 'Cause I have to book
the detective into the Bush Wolf.

28:02.820 --> 28:05.340
Like, this close to Feastival,
it's the only accommodation available.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.580
It's $400 a night!

28:07.780 --> 28:09.480
[whispers] Good. That's good.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.560
[loud jazz music plays]

28:16.640 --> 28:19.660
Can we turn off the jazz, please?

28:19.860 --> 28:21.140
[turns down volume]

28:21.340 --> 28:22.220
I said off...

28:22.420 --> 28:24.620
So, time of death was
between 3 and 4am.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.460
No foreign DNA on the body.

28:26.660 --> 28:30.020
No fabric fibres,
ergo, it's been thoroughly cleaned.

28:30.220 --> 28:33.380
The victim has sustained
some superficial cuts and bruising

28:33.580 --> 28:35.780
consistent with a fist-fight
prior to TOD.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.140
It's, ah, 'time of death', yeah?

28:38.340 --> 28:40.900
Toxicology report is pending,
but stomach contents reveal

28:41.100 --> 28:43.500
his last meal was approximately
10 hours before death,

28:43.700 --> 28:45.800
roughly 800g of steak.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.100
Steak? Nothing else?

28:49.300 --> 28:51.460
Nein. Just the rib-eye.

28:51.660 --> 28:54.380
Minor blunt object trauma
to the underside of the skull.

28:54.580 --> 28:55.740
Bruising and a small cut,

28:55.940 --> 28:59.780
and I retrieved this shard of
pink ceramic from the wound.

28:59.980 --> 29:01.900
Don't worry, it'll get tested.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.220
Now, ah...

29:03.420 --> 29:05.460
I know what you're thinking,
Detective, but... [chuckles]

29:05.660 --> 29:07.340
...that wound is actually
far too shallow to kill him.

29:07.540 --> 29:09.340
- I didn't think it did, mate.
- It's entirely superficial.

29:09.540 --> 29:10.540
- Got it.
- Couldn't have killed him.

29:10.740 --> 29:11.900
- Uh-huh.
- Too shallow.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.060
So the actual cause of death,
Detective Inspector, is...

29:14.260 --> 29:15.580
Strangulation.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.460
There's conjunctival, petechial
haemorrhaging, facial oedema,

29:18.660 --> 29:19.700
and the lacerations on the neck

29:19.900 --> 29:21.860
suggest garrotting
with some kind of wire, OK?

29:22.060 --> 29:23.260
See ya.

29:23.460 --> 29:24.980
Ooh!

29:25.180 --> 29:27.700
So close, Detective.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.900
So close, but there's actually
a little...

29:30.100 --> 29:31.480
...little detail that you missed.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.380
[woman on speaker]
<i>Evans strangled her, boiled her,</i>

29:35.580 --> 29:38.780
<i>then, over the next month,</i>
<i>this loving father ate his wife.</i>

29:38.980 --> 29:40.020
[woman 2 on speaker]<i> Oh, my God.</i>

29:40.220 --> 29:43.100
Ugh, have you met that
fuckin' Forensic Pathologist?

29:43.300 --> 29:45.420
- Yeah.
- He's a fuckin' bell-end, honestly.

29:45.620 --> 29:47.300
What an insufferable cunt!

29:47.500 --> 29:49.180
Right, come on.
I need to get to the widow.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.980
- [starts engine]
- Oh, God.

29:52.180 --> 29:53.300
is Adelaide always this cold?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.680
[Abby] I don't know, ma'am.
I've never been to Adelaide.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.500
Yes, I understand
how a warrant works, Phil.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.860
But if I'm requesting
a warrant for your camera,

30:02.060 --> 30:03.980
then I may as well write up
the illegal number of craypots

30:04.180 --> 30:06.220
Jimmy had on your boat last night and...

30:06.420 --> 30:08.420
Yeah, that'd be incredibly helpful,
thank you, Phil.

30:08.620 --> 30:10.320
Just drop the tapes at the station.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.300
Why can't we use the leaf blower, Gez?

30:13.500 --> 30:16.380
Because it's on the charge, sweetpea.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.860
Dulcie, Kevin's
blocking the bridge again.

30:19.060 --> 30:21.140
The Feastival lantern parade
goes over here tomorrow night.

30:21.340 --> 30:23.100
What do you expect everyone to do?
Just...

30:23.300 --> 30:25.900
Oh, just step over him, like
they're scissoring an aquatic turd?

30:26.100 --> 30:26.900
Get your gun.

30:27.100 --> 30:28.300
- What? No.
- Get your gun!

30:28.500 --> 30:29.780
I'm not gonna get my gun, Aleyna.

30:29.980 --> 30:31.740
We can just lure him off
with some food.

30:31.940 --> 30:34.580
Oh, no we can't,
because<i> your wife</i> won't let us.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.340
OK, then we shoo him away
like we did last time.

30:36.540 --> 30:38.300
Come on, shoo, Kevin!

30:38.500 --> 30:39.940
- Shhh!
- Piss off, Kevin!

30:40.140 --> 30:41.500
[Gez] Off you pop!

30:41.700 --> 30:44.540
Oh, if I had been allowed to just
put him down after Rod Dixon died,

30:44.740 --> 30:46.300
this wouldn't be happening right now.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.740
[Gez] Well, you know Mike Nugent.

30:47.940 --> 30:50.500
He was still on the force
when Rod's body was found.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.740
He said Rod's nose and lips
were chewed off

30:52.940 --> 30:54.660
and his tongue was totally gone.

30:54.860 --> 30:56.700
He's a monster.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.060
Sorry, what are you two on about?

30:58.260 --> 30:59.620
Kevin, Dulcie.

30:59.820 --> 31:02.180
After Mayor Dixon drowned
in that boat accident,

31:02.380 --> 31:05.620
his body washed up onto the beach
and Kevin ate his dead face off.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.700
Sorry, Mayor Dixon's body
was found on the beach, too?

31:08.900 --> 31:11.980
Yes. And it's like I said
in the pest control WhatsApp,

31:12.180 --> 31:15.580
when those things get a taste
for our blood, we become their prey.

31:15.780 --> 31:17.700
Kevin will kill one day, Dulcie.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.580
And if it happens at my lantern parade,

31:19.780 --> 31:22.580
and he eats a lesbian
from the mainland, that's on you.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.780
[beeps horn]

31:23.980 --> 31:26.060
Hey, sexy!

31:26.260 --> 31:28.900
You're not feeding Kevin, are you?
It just encourages him.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.540
Hi, Aleyna! How's your head?

31:31.740 --> 31:33.100
I feel like I've been
in a washing machine.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.140
I should not be driving!

31:35.340 --> 31:36.880
You ready to go, my love?

31:37.840 --> 31:38.960
Yeah. Yep.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.660
Is it in?

31:41.860 --> 31:43.700
What's going on around here?
North Pole hard rubbish?

31:43.900 --> 31:46.580
It's for the Deadloch Winter Feastival.
It's a month of food, art...

31:46.780 --> 31:49.140
- Is this us?
- Yes.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.980
Hey, ma'am, would you mind
if I joined you?

31:51.180 --> 31:52.680
Unless you usually work alone.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.860
No. I, er, don't. Didn't.

31:57.060 --> 31:59.340
- Suit yourself, Aggie.
- It's Abby. Thank you.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.700
- I'm actually a huge true crime junkie.
- Don't talk.

32:01.900 --> 32:02.800
OK.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.360
[snores]

32:09.680 --> 32:11.420
She sounds like a wood-chipper.

32:11.620 --> 32:14.120
Doctor-Mayor Rahme
prescribed her tranquilisers.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.180
No worries.

32:18.380 --> 32:21.460
I'll just have a little chat with you
until she wakes up.

32:21.660 --> 32:25.020
So, um, remind me again.

32:25.220 --> 32:27.840
What'd you lot get up to
on Friday night?

32:28.880 --> 32:32.320
We, um, ate dinner, and then
everyone went to bed at 11pm.

32:34.040 --> 32:37.180
And what was it th... that
you all had for dinner again?

32:37.380 --> 32:38.980
Uh, tuna mornay.

32:39.180 --> 32:41.500
Really? Tuna mornay.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.300
Cream of the sea.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.480
[thumps table loudly]

32:45.960 --> 32:46.900
[snores]

32:47.100 --> 32:48.860
That's solid. That is...

32:49.060 --> 32:50.860
That's a good hard table.
Is that oak, is it?

32:51.060 --> 32:52.240
It's Anko.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.640
Oak veneer.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.820
What happened there?

32:58.020 --> 32:59.780
Uh, I kicked that hole.

32:59.980 --> 33:01.160
With my schoolbag.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.180
What about this?
What's this, Doug?

33:06.380 --> 33:08.180
- Uh, I'm Dolph.
- Don't lie to me.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.440
I'm not.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.860
Oops.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.760
Sorry about that. I'm a bit of
a butter-fingers Barry today.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.180
I should get back to
funeral preparations.

33:20.380 --> 33:21.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Quick one.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.260
Um...

33:23.460 --> 33:26.700
what was your Mum
and Uncle Gavin's relationship like?

33:26.900 --> 33:29.220
Good. Close. Normal.

33:29.420 --> 33:30.680
Close to normal.

33:36.080 --> 33:40.180
So I was thinking this paddock here
could be for regenerative farming.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.220
We just need 400 ducks.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.620
Cath, would a seal eat human flesh?

33:44.820 --> 33:46.500
Is this about euthanising Kevin?

33:46.700 --> 33:50.020
I've told Aleyna, Kevin is not
a man-eater. He eats fish.

33:50.220 --> 33:53.600
And squid, and sausages
from the public barbecue.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.940
Are you with me, love?

33:57.140 --> 34:00.220
Yeah, sorry, love. I am.
I am... I am here...

34:00.420 --> 34:01.820
in this paddock...

34:02.020 --> 34:03.980
with the burnt sheep skull.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.220
Yeah, well obviously this place
needs some work,

34:06.420 --> 34:07.780
but if we don't move fast,
it's going to go to

34:07.980 --> 34:10.500
some cashed-up climate migrant
from the mainland.

34:10.700 --> 34:14.300
Just doesn't buying now reduce
our 10-year plan by roughly 10 years?

34:14.500 --> 34:17.900
I am not turning 50 in a house
without a permanent compost system.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.160
It's barbaric.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.260
I know you don't like change, Dulce,

34:23.460 --> 34:26.860
but it's time that we just start
thinking about our forever-Deadloch-home

34:27.060 --> 34:29.980
to match our forever-Deadloch-life.

34:30.180 --> 34:31.940
A place where we can...

34:32.140 --> 34:34.060
grow old and die.

34:34.260 --> 34:36.880
- [phone buzzes]
- Oh gosh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.860
Ah, so sorry, Cath.
I do have to take this.

34:41.060 --> 34:43.340
No probs, I'll just measure out
the dimensions of the Dog Motel.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.500
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but quick question.

34:46.700 --> 34:49.580
Can you interview a minor
if their guardian is unconscious?

34:49.780 --> 34:51.020
Ah, no, you cannot.

34:51.220 --> 34:54.020
OK, and what about collecting evidence?
Do you need a warrant for that?

34:54.220 --> 34:55.860
<i>Did the detective collect</i>
<i>evidence without a warrant?</i>

34:56.060 --> 34:57.300
- Maybe.
- Unbelievable.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.300
Sorry, this is all my fault, somehow.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.020
Has she been to the crime scene?
Did she mention boats? The tide?

35:02.220 --> 35:03.180
Um, we haven't been,

35:03.380 --> 35:05.260

"freeze her nips off on a beach

<i>Her words.</i>

35:08.420 --> 35:10.640
- Right, Big Eyes!
- I gotta go. I'll report back.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.700
Sorry, love. That was...

35:15.900 --> 35:19.340
Is that the detective?
What's he like? Is he a dick-swinger?

35:19.540 --> 35:20.860
Yeah.

35:21.060 --> 35:22.700
Yep, you could say that.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.060
Oh, I'm glad he's arrived,
'cause I need you to help me

35:27.660 --> 35:30.260
I'll have to show you the septic tank
another time. We'll be late.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.160
- For what?
- Choir!

35:36.400 --> 35:38.780
I need grub. What's the pub
situation in this town?

35:38.980 --> 35:40.660
Um, the Bush Wolf is a gastro-pub.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.420
Oh, I wouldn't be putting that
on a business card.

35:42.620 --> 35:43.980
No, where does our mate Gavin go?

35:44.180 --> 35:45.660

Detective, I believe that
there's a chance

that you're wrong about
Gavin Latham killing his brother.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.260
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

40:19.460 --> 40:22.740
I've become well acquainted
with Gavin over the last five years

40:22.940 --> 40:25.340
and I question whether
he's capable of doing this.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.060
For instance, there was
no evidence at the scene,

40:27.260 --> 40:30.420
no footprints, no DNA, nothing
that would indicate that anything...

40:30.620 --> 40:33.540

- What?

His tongue was missing.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.020
Five years ago,
Deadloch's Mayor, Rod Dixon,

41:33.220 --> 41:35.380
washed up dead on the same beach
as Trent Latham.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.460
His tongue was also missing.

41:37.660 --> 41:38.580
- There are no photos.
- Exactly.

41:38.780 --> 41:41.540
And according to this,
it was a boating accident,

41:41.740 --> 41:44.060
he was fully clothed
and his tongue was eaten by a seal.

41:44.260 --> 41:45.380
Jesus, what?

41:45.580 --> 41:47.860
But the lack of photos shows that
protocol clearly wasn't followed,

41:48.060 --> 41:50.980
so I am questioning the validity
of the police ruling on that.

41:51.180 --> 41:54.180

I'm standing in a haunted perve room

41:54.380 --> 41:55.660

41:55.860 --> 41:58.060

I think that this is much bigger...

With all due respect?
Why do you give a shit, mate?

42:00.380 --> 42:02.060
I give a sh... I...

42:02.260 --> 42:05.460

42:05.660 --> 42:07.300
because you are investigating
the wrong person

42:07.500 --> 42:10.100
and you are underestimating
whoever did kill Trent.

42:10.300 --> 42:11.700
I believe that this is bigger than
one death.

42:11.900 --> 42:14.820
I think that there is... a connection
between these two deaths,

42:15.020 --> 42:18.420
and someone... the killer,
is still out there.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.660
Oh, the killer! Listen, I get it.

43:41.860 --> 43:43.780
Yeah, do you have a minute?

43:43.980 --> 43:46.360

[indistinct chatter]

43:53.840 --> 43:55.940
Ma'am, Phil McGangus just dropped off

43:56.140 --> 43:58.220
- the security camera footage
from his trawler.
- Mm-hm.

43:58.420 --> 43:59.940
Maybe I'm more intimidating
than I thought.

44:00.140 --> 44:02.420
- Watch it, tell me
if you spot anything.
- OK.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.180
Have you seen
the pest control WhatsApp?

44:04.380 --> 44:05.580
Well, Kevin's back on the foreshore

44:05.780 --> 44:07.500
and Aleyna wants you to
go down there with a taser.

44:07.700 --> 44:09.300
- Now, we have...
- Senior Sergeant!

44:09.500 --> 44:11.820
I just got off a phone call with
Commissioner What's-his-dick.

44:12.020 --> 44:13.820
You'll never guess who's
working the case with me now!

44:14.020 --> 44:15.420
Well, I spoke to
the Commissioner this morning

44:15.620 --> 44:17.140
and he agreed with me
that I should stay on the...

44:17.340 --> 44:20.060
That you should fuck all of my cavities
till I'm one big hole?

44:20.260 --> 44:21.620
That I should continue to
work the case...

44:21.820 --> 44:23.700
Big Eyes! Where's the brother?
I want to talk to him now.

44:23.900 --> 44:25.820
He's not returning
any of our phone calls, ma'am.

44:26.020 --> 44:26.820
Yeah, of course he's not.

44:27.020 --> 44:28.380
He's a fuckin' murderer,
not your fuckin' nan.

44:28.580 --> 44:31.740
You, drag that dick-nut in here.
We're charging him. Oh!

44:31.940 --> 44:34.460
You cannot arrest a person
without evidence, Detective.

44:34.660 --> 44:35.980
Get the stick out of your arse!

44:36.180 --> 44:37.780
There's no need for you
to ride my dick this hard.

44:37.980 --> 44:41.020
I'm not going to be in town long enough
for us to, you know, bump titties.

44:41.220 --> 44:43.500
Sorry to break it to you,
but by midday today,

44:43.700 --> 44:45.260
you're gonna be back
babysitting that walrus.

44:45.460 --> 44:46.540
- It's a seal.
- [Abby] Detective?

44:46.740 --> 44:47.540
[both] Yes.

44:47.740 --> 44:48.820
I was just looking at the boat footage

44:49.020 --> 44:53.020
and I think there's something
maybe you should see. Maybe?

44:53.220 --> 44:55.060
Oh, bum, I've gone too far.

44:55.260 --> 44:56.500
- I'll rewind.
- Mm-hm.

44:56.700 --> 44:59.380
What are we doing here, guys?

44:59.580 --> 45:01.220
Lack of liver mortis on the body

45:01.420 --> 45:03.300
suggests that Trent was moved
after death,

45:03.500 --> 45:04.740
and his position on the sand

45:04.940 --> 45:06.540
suggests the killer
knew the high tide times

45:06.740 --> 45:08.700
and used that to wash away
evidence from the body.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.940
So Gavin dragged the body to
the beach for a little bath. Who cares?

45:11.140 --> 45:13.780
No, no. Forensics combed
the foreshore. It wasn't disturbed.

45:13.980 --> 45:15.460
I don't think that the killer
got there by land.

45:15.660 --> 45:17.940
I think they transported Trent
to the beach by boat

45:18.140 --> 45:19.540
to avoid detection.

45:19.740 --> 45:22.420
It's like I said last night, Detective.
This killer is smart.

45:22.620 --> 45:23.860
Did ya? I wasn't listening.

45:24.060 --> 45:25.820
Abby! Do you need to get to
your wedding dress fitting?

45:26.020 --> 45:26.820
I can stay.

45:27.020 --> 45:30.280
No, it is OK. I do know how to
use a computer, Constable.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.300
Don't... Oh.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.500
OK.

- No, I am. I was going to.

- I am using the mouse to do that.

45:45.360 --> 45:46.580
OK.

45:46.780 --> 45:47.820
Whose fuckin' ute's that?

45:48.020 --> 45:49.620
Gavin's. And that's the Pro-Bro boat.

- What, the sloop on the left?
- No, the one on the other side.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.380
Who's this A-frame motherfucker?

45:57.580 --> 45:58.820
That's Trent.

45:59.020 --> 46:01.940
- What time is it?
- Ah, 22:56.

That was forensics.

47:05.340 --> 47:07.620
The shard from Trent's head wound
