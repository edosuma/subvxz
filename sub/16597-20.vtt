18:53.915 --> 18:55.482
His cadence is slow.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.267
He has an odd gait,
strange hair,

18:58.354 --> 18:59.616
and face
never shows emotion.

19:02.358 --> 19:05.274
Okay, I lost
my train of thought.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.884
Look, man, you can't
just fire somebody

19:06.971 --> 19:08.059
because
you don't like them.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.584
Ohh!
What ever do you mean?

19:10.671 --> 19:12.847
I mean, all I see is
a-a dip in the numbers.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.762
Numbers!
Numbers, right.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.460
Our patient-per-day ratio
may be barely down,

19:17.547 --> 19:19.070
but that's because
Pat gives the doctors

19:19.158 --> 19:22.030
more time to spend
with each patient,

19:22.117 --> 19:24.685
and because of that,
our re-hospitalization rate
is down

19:24.772 --> 19:27.731
and our overall morbidity
and mortality rates,

19:27.818 --> 19:30.560
because Pat knows
how important patient care is.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.215
And when the nurses union
needed more manageable hours,

19:33.302 --> 19:34.695
Pat gave them to us

19:34.782 --> 19:36.305
because he knew
it was the right thing to do.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.525
I had a health scare
last month,

19:38.612 --> 19:41.223
and he gave me time off
and helped me find
the best doctor.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.269
He-He couldn't have been
more supportive.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.923
Pat Hein is the most
thoughtful, caring person
I've ever met.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.622
That's why
I'm his girlfriend.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.190
That's right.
We're back together again.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.756
The muffin never lies!

19:57.587 --> 19:59.110
Look,
the bottom line is...

19:59.198 --> 20:00.329
You guys
are back together?

20:00.416 --> 20:01.852
I know!Oh, my God!

20:01.939 --> 20:03.550
Shh, shh, shh!
Shush, shush! Not now!

20:06.161 --> 20:10.644
Pat takes care of us
so we can take care
of our patients.

20:10.731 --> 20:13.386
It may not be a hug
or an ugly sweater...

20:15.039 --> 20:18.304
but that is
what real warmth is.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.914
So, how did this happen?

20:20.001 --> 20:20.784
I totally called it.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.221
Really?Yeah.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.352
From a muffin.From a muffin.

20:23.439 --> 20:24.788
You know what? Hey!
[LAUGHS]

20:24.875 --> 20:26.703
I can see it.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.228
You guys are
actually a family.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.056
And, Pat, you're not the
weird uncle that nobody likes.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.277
You're the weird uncle
that everybody likes.

20:37.975 --> 20:40.108
Thank you for noticing,
Charles.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.893
In fact, you and I
are quite similar.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.112
Ah.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.332
We're both
handsome blokes

20:46.419 --> 20:48.769
who prefer
an odd turn of phrase.Mm.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.161
And at the end
of the day,

20:50.249 --> 20:51.511
we love the people
we work with.

20:51.598 --> 20:54.165
It's like
that old Kiwi saying,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.385
"Sometimes you meet someone
and think something of them,

20:56.472 --> 20:58.909
"and then you find out
that others think
different things of them,

20:58.996 --> 21:00.084
"and then
you change your mind

21:00.171 --> 21:01.695
"about what it was
you were going to do."

21:01.782 --> 21:03.305
Mm.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.307
I say that
all the time.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.442
All right, carry on!

21:09.529 --> 21:12.314
Oh, and, Pat,
I'm sorry for the dust-up.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.707
Oh, not a problem.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.926
You know,
hearing your kind words

21:16.013 --> 21:18.407
and feeling the love
of my colleagues...

21:18.494 --> 21:20.670
Well, that's better
than any promotion.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.672
I'm glad
you feel that way.
