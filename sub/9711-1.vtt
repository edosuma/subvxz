00:49.906 --> 00:50.930
Ten hut!

01:01.150 --> 01:02.447
At ease.

01:03.553 --> 01:06.522
I'm often asked, “What makes a hero?”

01:07.290 --> 01:09.850
Courage, selflessness, sacrifice.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.222
From Bunker Hill to the Alamo,

01:13.262 --> 01:14.780
Gettysburg to Normandy,

01:14.797 --> 01:17.701
Korea to Khe Sanh,
the American fighting man

01:18.100 --> 01:20.591
has always answered the call of duty.

01:21.304 --> 01:23.795
These are dangerous times, gentlemen.

01:24.073 --> 01:27.769
Once more, America is in need
of its best and brightest.

01:28.311 --> 01:31.007
One wonders if there are still heroes.

01:31.781 --> 01:33.408
Somebody say “hero”?

01:34.817 --> 01:35.806
Hi.

01:35.918 --> 01:38.045
Two Deadwood meatball subs

01:38.154 --> 01:39.672
with extra tumbleweeds.

01:41.090 --> 01:45.116
Ah, don't worry about that hair,
I'm using a new conditioner.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.529
Sugar britches!

01:48.598 --> 01:51.567
–Larry, we need to talk.
–Talk?

01:51.667 --> 01:54.264
What is that, some kind of code
for a lunchtime quickie?

01:54.304 --> 01:56.878
–Diaper table, ladies room.
–No, Larry…

01:56.907 --> 01:58.340
I'm pregnant.

01:59.743 --> 02:02.109
Pregnant. That's great news!

02:02.379 --> 02:05.475
I just got promoted!
Now we can move in together!

02:05.515 --> 02:07.644
–I got an idea, come here!
–No, Larry!

02:07.684 --> 02:09.268
–Just a second…
–Let me…

02:09.286 --> 02:10.947
I gotta do this.

02:11.054 --> 02:12.954
Hey, everybody? Folks,

02:13.056 --> 02:15.498
my name's Larry, and I'm your server.

02:15.692 --> 02:19.690
And this precious little lady right here
is my girlfriend, Karen.

02:19.730 --> 02:20.697
Hi.

02:20.797 --> 02:23.925
And I'm happy to say
she's having my baby.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.467
Oh!

02:26.903 --> 02:29.466
So, on this special occasion just for today,

02:29.506 --> 02:34.456
the salad bar will be free for an hour
with all the fixings you can handle.

02:34.645 --> 02:36.173
Hold on. Before you all get up there

02:36.213 --> 02:38.308
to get your bacon bits and your chick peas,

02:38.348 --> 02:40.377
there's one more thing I need to do.

02:40.417 --> 02:42.078
No, Larry. Larry, please.

02:42.185 --> 02:45.115
No, honey, I want to say this
in front of God and everybody.

02:45.155 --> 02:47.146
Larry, please! Larry, I…

02:47.257 --> 02:48.451
Karen,

02:49.860 --> 02:51.851
I love you with all my heart,

02:52.462 --> 02:56.026
and you would make me
the happiest man in the world if

02:56.634 --> 02:58.226
you'd be my wife.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.331
Oh!

03:02.206 --> 03:03.195
I…

03:03.308 --> 03:08.258
No, say it in here. I want the whole world
to share in this special moment.

03:13.284 --> 03:14.979
It's not your baby.

03:22.927 --> 03:24.055
I don't understand.

03:24.095 --> 03:27.525
It means she's got a bun in her oven
that ain't your recipe.

03:27.565 --> 03:30.271
Now, is the salad bar still free, though?

03:30.335 --> 03:31.666
Why would you care?

03:31.769 --> 03:35.465
Doesn't look like you've had a salad
in your whole life.

03:42.814 --> 03:45.840
I'm not telling you again. Now, get in here!

03:49.320 --> 03:52.312
–Die, paleface!
–You little bastards!

03:52.490 --> 03:55.721
Hey! Hey, now! Hey, now! Hey!

03:56.828 --> 03:59.297
Hey! Knock that shit off!

03:59.698 --> 04:01.666
Those are my good golf clubs!

04:01.767 --> 04:04.129
My little Rusty. He's a dickens, isn't he?

04:04.169 --> 04:06.262
He's got a nice backswing.

04:09.341 --> 04:11.503
–So, how's Connie?
–Oh, she's great.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.006
Damn it, Bill!
You better control these kids of yours!

04:14.046 --> 04:16.105
They tore up the backyard!

04:16.315 --> 04:18.610
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

04:18.649 --> 04:21.817
Turn the garden hose on them!
I'm busy out here.

04:23.255 --> 04:25.384
I guess this is the kind
of marital bliss I'm missing out on.

04:25.424 --> 04:28.188
Oh, marriage is a wonderful institution.

04:29.428 --> 04:33.057
Of course, 50% of all marriages
end in divorce.

04:34.299 --> 04:37.533
That is, if you're lucky enough
to get a divorce.

04:38.070 --> 04:42.601
That becomes impossible when your wife's
got incriminating photos of you

04:42.641 --> 04:47.459
simply having coffee with a young dancer
'cause she was a great listener.

04:47.479 --> 04:51.381
Now, your life is just one series
of endless humiliations.

04:52.317 --> 04:55.775
You lie awake and dream
of the sweet release

04:55.888 --> 04:58.220
a murder/suicide could bring.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.020
But it's good, though. Really good.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.392
Nice move by Orton!

05:04.130 --> 05:09.014
Well, normally, I don't gotta pay for it,
but life is full of sad stories.

05:12.405 --> 05:14.566
Oh, my God.

05:15.108 --> 05:16.541
Hey, Victor.

05:18.211 --> 05:19.678
What is this?

05:19.813 --> 05:22.255
When I hired you as a security guard,

05:22.348 --> 05:25.450
I didn't think you was going
to be living here.

05:25.518 --> 05:28.510
This is a storage unit, not an apartment.

05:28.688 --> 05:30.884
As a former law enforcement officer, it…

05:30.924 --> 05:32.721
Law enforcement?

05:32.959 --> 05:35.792
You were a cop for, what, only four days

05:35.895 --> 05:38.658
before you drive your car
right through the beauty parlor?

05:38.698 --> 05:41.594
–It was a nail salon.
–What the hell's the difference?

05:41.634 --> 05:42.794
Just…

05:42.902 --> 05:44.733
Clean this shit up!

05:45.705 --> 05:46.763
Oh,

05:46.940 --> 05:48.524
and keep your eyes open.

05:48.975 --> 05:50.904
Some drunk has been exposing himself

05:50.944 --> 05:54.140
to the waitresses
at the Denny's across the street.

05:54.180 --> 05:58.272
The last time, the crazy bastard
was carrying a samurai sword.

06:02.055 --> 06:04.451
There's a lot of deviants out there,
ain't they, Victor?

06:04.491 --> 06:05.553
But don't you worry.

06:05.593 --> 06:08.289
I'm gonna keep a eye out
when I'm on my next patrol.

06:08.329 --> 06:11.525
I gotta get going.
I've got a big weekend planned.

06:11.565 --> 06:14.595
Look, man, you're better off
without Karen or that crummy job.

06:14.635 --> 06:15.761
Am l?

06:16.203 --> 06:20.267
Larry, listen to me, it's always darkest
right before the dawn, all right?

06:20.307 --> 06:22.603
Now, you remember when I had shingles?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.770
Did I give up? Nope.

06:24.879 --> 06:27.641
I put my nose to the grindstone.
All my hard work paid off.

06:27.681 --> 06:28.978
Hard work?

06:29.183 --> 06:30.878
Are you kidding me?

06:31.018 --> 06:32.866
You tripped at the Wal-Mart!

06:32.887 --> 06:36.116
And every day I thank God
for that spill on aisle 6.

06:36.156 --> 06:40.287
Because of that settlement,
I don't gotta work for another 11 months.

06:40.327 --> 06:41.889
All right, look. Here's Everett.

06:41.929 --> 06:44.158
Now, come on. It's our Reserve weekend.

06:44.198 --> 06:47.102
We're gonna have a great time.
We always do.

06:47.968 --> 06:51.131
Thanks for showing up, Everett.
We've only been waiting an hour.

06:51.171 --> 06:54.001
Anybody ever tell you that loitering
is a class D misdemeanor

06:54.041 --> 06:57.171
punishable by a $50 fine
and 10 hours of community service?

06:57.211 --> 07:00.574
Hey, what's the penalty
for vehicular homicide of a beauty parlor?

07:00.614 --> 07:02.343
It was a nail salon.

07:04.385 --> 07:07.515
Well, what a great way
to chase away the break-up blues,

07:07.555 --> 07:10.064
spending the weekend with two retards.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.794
Nice shooting! Man.

07:17.899 --> 07:18.923
What's next?

07:19.034 --> 07:20.467
That bathroom scale.

07:20.569 --> 07:24.331
I'm gonna blow up every nice thing
I ever got that woman.

07:24.673 --> 07:27.164
I got her that on Valentine's Day.

07:27.742 --> 07:29.232
I'm a romantic.

07:29.344 --> 07:30.606
Pull!

07:33.715 --> 07:34.909
Everett!

07:37.485 --> 07:39.476
What are y'all doing?

07:39.988 --> 07:41.750
–Shooting shit.
–Grief counseling.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.836
Copy that. Going on a beer run.

07:49.531 --> 07:50.828
Nice!

07:50.932 --> 07:53.328
–I know. I feel better already.
–Good.

07:53.368 --> 07:55.730
Kind of hungry though.
What do you say we hit the mess hall?

07:55.770 --> 07:57.431
Hooters?

07:58.006 --> 07:58.773
Left! Left!

07:58.773 --> 07:59.401
Left! Left!

07:59.441 --> 08:01.466
Left, right, left.

08:03.745 --> 08:06.808
Sir, we just received another
manpower request from Washington.

08:06.848 --> 08:08.710
There's increased fighting
outside of Fallujah.

08:08.750 --> 08:09.774
What?

08:09.884 --> 08:13.149
Don't those Pentagon pencil-pushers know
we're stretched to the limit down here?

08:13.189 --> 08:14.584
What about those men down
at Chattahoochee?

08:14.624 --> 08:17.252
I don't think they all reported in.

08:21.497 --> 08:24.493
They drill at the Reserve Center
down on Highway 8.

08:24.533 --> 08:27.964
Perhaps you should send Sergeant Kilgore
down there to see what we have.

08:28.004 --> 08:29.198
Kilgore?

08:31.007 --> 08:33.168
He scares the shit out of me.

08:34.076 --> 08:37.974
All I'm saying is some of them girls hadn't
ought to be wearing little shorty-shorts.

08:38.014 --> 08:39.041
That's all I'm saying.

08:39.081 --> 08:40.409
Well, what's Crystal supposed to do?

08:40.448 --> 08:43.312
You know Hooters
don't got a maternity leave.

08:43.352 --> 08:45.684
Hey. Who's the new guy?

08:45.788 --> 08:48.484
How you doing, Gl Joe? Can I help you?

08:52.862 --> 08:54.659
Sergeant Kilgore.

08:54.964 --> 08:58.924
I'm looking for the men
that didn't mobilize with this unit.

08:59.268 --> 09:02.131
–I ain't seen them.
–I think they went over to…

09:02.171 --> 09:03.532
Who's in charge here, soldier?

09:03.572 --> 09:05.130
–I am.
–I am.

09:06.676 --> 09:07.870
This is

09:09.378 --> 09:10.573
quite a setup you got here.

09:10.613 --> 09:11.674
Oh, yeah, it's nice.

09:11.714 --> 09:13.509
We're like a water-head
at the theme park in here.

09:13.549 --> 09:14.645
It's real comfortable.

09:14.685 --> 09:18.515
We're about to watch the game.
You can join us if you want. Grab a chair.

09:18.555 --> 09:21.683
I tell you what, son. You know, I like you.

09:22.359 --> 09:24.554
Why don't I grab a chair,

09:25.595 --> 09:27.620
and shove it up your ass!

09:28.031 --> 09:30.761
Now, stand at attention,
you miserable pissants!

09:30.801 --> 09:34.567
From now on,
you will address me as Sergeant Kilgore!

09:34.671 --> 09:36.700
The honeymoon's over, numb nuts!

09:36.740 --> 09:38.332
I am a warrior,

09:38.442 --> 09:40.069
a killing machine,

09:40.277 --> 09:43.178
and your mama's not
here to wet-nurse you.

09:44.281 --> 09:47.307
Larry's mom passed away
about four years ago.

09:47.417 --> 09:48.478
Yeah, that's true.

09:48.518 --> 09:49.913
She went squirrel hunting
with my Uncle Lester…

09:49.953 --> 09:51.147
Shut up!

09:52.089 --> 09:54.117
I don't know what kind
of horseshit monkey business

09:54.157 --> 09:57.654
has been going on down here,
but that's all about to end, ladies.

09:57.694 --> 09:59.286
This is the Army.

09:59.996 --> 10:02.590
We're just state military reserves.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.330
Yeah. Smurfs.

10:04.434 --> 10:06.299
And I'm a leprechaun.

10:06.903 --> 10:08.632
Now, pack your gear.

10:09.306 --> 10:11.638
But we're just weekend warriors.

10:14.444 --> 10:16.640
Well, I'll tell you what, fat body,

10:16.680 --> 10:17.978
this weekend,

10:18.082 --> 10:19.572
I own your ass!

10:20.918 --> 10:22.408
Son of a bitch.

10:24.956 --> 10:28.058
If there was ever a worse
excuse for a soldier,

10:28.159 --> 10:29.956
I'd like to meet him.

10:30.061 --> 10:31.392
Hey, y'all.

10:31.562 --> 10:35.191
I got Funyuns, beer, and Barely Legal.
Who wants what?

10:35.967 --> 10:39.003
Well, hey, there, Sarge.
Snap into a Slim Jim.

10:39.937 --> 10:44.168
Well, this looks like a little slice of heaven.
Can they do this to us?

10:44.208 --> 10:46.537
It's the army, man.
They can do whatever they want.

10:46.577 --> 10:49.011
Welcome to Fort Davis, ladies.

10:52.316 --> 10:55.080
I want another one! Come on! One more!

10:55.186 --> 10:57.245
Up, up, up! Down, up!

10:57.355 --> 10:59.917
All right, you're all mine now.
You ready, Freddy?

10:59.957 --> 11:01.219
Oh, there you go. How about that? Huh?

11:01.259 --> 11:02.726
You like that?

11:15.072 --> 11:18.041
–Get back here!
–What are you doing?

11:18.342 --> 11:20.105
Watch out! Watch out!

11:20.846 --> 11:22.473
Get up there!

11:31.423 --> 11:33.118
Take it like a man!

11:46.138 --> 11:47.628
Get out of here!

11:49.308 --> 11:51.401
You gotta stay clear…

11:51.710 --> 11:54.773
–Come on, Everett. Let me hold it.
–No, no. It's mine.

11:54.813 --> 11:56.713
Look out!

11:58.350 --> 11:59.408
Yeah!

12:06.692 --> 12:09.021
This is a little harder than I thought.

12:09.061 --> 12:13.615
But I guess it's the price you pay
to be a trained government killer.

12:14.366 --> 12:17.199
I didn't think they could activate us.

12:17.302 --> 12:20.532
I mean, if I wanted to get my ass kicked,
I'd have stayed home with Connie.

12:20.572 --> 12:24.339
I guess it easier for
a samurai-type like myself.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.002
Accept the pain.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.180
It's cleansing.

12:28.715 --> 12:32.913
Plus, the weekend's almost over.
One more day and we're gone.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.151
Besides, how much worse could it get?

12:45.865 --> 12:47.924
Rise and shine, ladies!

12:49.469 --> 12:51.977
Where the hell is that other fat turd?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.299
Hey, speaking of turds,

12:53.339 --> 12:55.869
I just left one in there
for the Guinness Book.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.241
Stand at attention, soldier!

12:59.712 --> 13:01.703
Congratulations, gentlemen.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.849
We just got our orders.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.884
We're going to paradise,

13:06.152 --> 13:08.586
the land of sand and sun.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.623
–Daytona Beach?
–Fallujah, lraq, numb nuts!

13:12.225 --> 13:14.591
Sarge, excuse me.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.992
Far be it for me to stand in the way
of the war on terror,

13:19.032 --> 13:21.626
but we're supposed to go home tomorrow.

13:22.068 --> 13:25.231
I mean, seriously, we only do this
one weekend a month.

13:25.271 --> 13:28.569
–Yeah, and on Mondays, I cut the grass.
–Wrong, sunshine!

13:28.609 --> 13:30.271
You will be the tip of the spear

13:30.311 --> 13:33.576
Uncle Sam uses to shove
up some insurgent's ass!

13:33.681 --> 13:36.377
Sarge, now that's downright unsanitary.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.580
You know, I read somewhere that them
carpet-fliers don't even use toilet paper.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.178
Can it, dipshit!

13:41.755 --> 13:45.452
And don't worry,
you won't be in the rear with the gear.

13:45.559 --> 13:49.996
I plan on volunteering us
for every dangerous assignment there is!

13:50.297 --> 13:53.560
Now, I want every one of you
to look to the man on your right!

13:53.600 --> 13:56.068
Now, look to the man on your left,

13:56.503 --> 13:59.301
'cause your life is in his hands.

14:02.576 --> 14:03.634
Shit!

14:03.978 --> 14:07.106
Fallujah. No, it's not in Louisiana.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.810
–It's in lraq.
–Why are they sending you to Iraq?

14:09.850 --> 14:12.216
–'Cause I'm going to war!
–War?

14:12.319 --> 14:14.448
–Well, I can't help it.
–Who's gonna mow the grass?

14:14.488 --> 14:16.216
Well, I don't know who's
gonna mow the grass.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.351
God damn it, Bill!

14:17.391 --> 14:19.188
Five hundred dollars?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.590
Damn. Does she have four tits?

14:22.563 --> 14:25.225
Well, how about a military discount?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.959
Hello? Hello?

14:32.240 --> 14:34.536
–Hey, what unit you with?
-101st Airborne.

14:34.576 --> 14:36.544
Screaming Eagles. You?

14:36.945 --> 14:40.244
37th Georgia. The Sleeping Marmots.

14:40.849 --> 14:43.477
What's up, y'all? How'd Connie take it?

14:43.585 --> 14:45.914
Let me just put it this way.
I'll be safer in lraq.

14:45.954 --> 14:47.251
Ten hut!

14:48.690 --> 14:50.817
All right, you maggots,

14:51.226 --> 14:53.272
we got a long road ahead of us,

14:53.294 --> 14:55.057
and it won't be easy.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.760
But it's my job as your
sergeant to lead the way.

14:58.800 --> 14:59.828
Gee, thanks, Sarge.

14:59.868 --> 15:01.896
I know I'll feel safer standing
directly behind you

15:01.936 --> 15:03.916
when the bullets start flying.

15:17.519 --> 15:19.248
Can that shit!

15:21.589 --> 15:24.652
Now, Larry,
I'm appointing you acting squad leader.

15:24.692 --> 15:26.421
Don't get too excited.

15:26.528 --> 15:28.857
You beat out a mongoloid and a candy-ass.

15:28.897 --> 15:30.626
He called you a candy-ass.

15:30.732 --> 15:33.796
Gee, thanks, Sarge.
You know, I learned a lot about leadership

15:33.836 --> 15:37.004
when I was secretary
of the Midgeville Gun Club.

15:37.807 --> 15:39.101
And don't you worry about it.

15:39.141 --> 15:41.237
Both those shootings
were ruled accidental.

15:41.277 --> 15:43.039
Keep your hands to yourself!

15:43.079 --> 15:45.441
It's don't ask and don't tell
in this man's army.

15:45.481 --> 15:48.177
Now, get your candy-asses on that plane.

15:51.987 --> 15:54.950
Did you hear what I said?
I gave you an order.

15:54.990 --> 15:58.084
You said candy-asses. I'm a mongoloid, sir!

15:58.194 --> 16:00.321
Get your ass on that plane!

16:01.030 --> 16:02.327
Candy-ass.

16:10.806 --> 16:11.795
Oh, sure.

16:11.907 --> 16:14.203
Killing a man
with your bare hands is real easy.

16:14.243 --> 16:16.806
Aside from the assorted
choke holds and head yanks,

16:16.846 --> 16:19.208
you deliver a hand-spear to a man's temple,

16:19.248 --> 16:23.378
Adam's apple, kidneys, armpits,
solar plexus, testicles,

16:23.486 --> 16:26.282
or coccyx, that's the little
bone down by your back…

16:26.322 --> 16:27.983
That's real informative, Everett,

16:28.023 --> 16:30.386
but come on, I'm trying
to get some sleep here.

16:30.426 --> 16:33.556
Of course, all that pales in comparison
to the heart-punch.

16:33.596 --> 16:38.217
It's a strong man's attack,
a sharp blow delivered right to the heart.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.897
Chuck Norris used it once
on the set of Walker, Texas Ranger

16:40.937 --> 16:43.235
to kill some smart-ass intern.

16:44.674 --> 16:46.801
Talk about your hush-money.

16:46.910 --> 16:48.002
All right.

16:48.111 --> 16:50.204
All right. That's it.

16:54.351 --> 16:56.012
Let's hit it.

17:04.594 --> 17:07.424
I don't think the flight attendant
turned off the fasten seatbelt sign.

17:07.464 --> 17:10.861
Look, y'all, if I'm gonna die tomorrow,
I want to get a good night's sleep.

17:10.901 --> 17:14.598
My Uncle Dave died in his sleep.
That's a peaceful way to go.

17:14.637 --> 17:17.400
Of course, all his friends died
screaming from the back seat

17:17.440 --> 17:19.271
trying to wake him up.

17:19.376 --> 17:20.843
It was a mess.

17:21.077 --> 17:22.635
Good night, Everett!

17:22.746 --> 17:25.476
–Good night, Larry.
–Good night, Larry.

17:31.521 --> 17:33.250
Who farted?

17:36.626 --> 17:39.151
Severe weather alert until 0600 hours.

17:39.263 --> 17:40.628
With a possible…

17:43.234 --> 17:45.229
I'm losing all pressure
in engines three and four!

17:45.269 --> 17:48.371
Hydraulic pressure down
in the rear stabilizer.

17:53.110 --> 17:54.702
Damn it!

18:13.698 --> 18:15.826
–Oh, this is bad.
–Losing altitude.

18:15.866 --> 18:18.836
We're overloaded.
Get ready to dump the gear.

18:20.771 --> 18:22.466
What the…

18:33.217 --> 18:35.777
Hey! Wait a minute!

18:38.222 --> 18:39.655
Come on!

18:40.491 --> 18:42.756
Hey! Wait a minute!

18:47.065 --> 18:48.054
No!

18:59.945 --> 19:03.244
I'm gonna kill you miserable pissants!

19:04.783 --> 19:06.842
Did you hear something?

19:07.552 --> 19:08.712
That was weird.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.782
For a minute there,
I thought we were goners.

19:10.822 --> 19:12.551
What are we gonna do
about the gear we dumped?

19:12.591 --> 19:15.721
You fill out the paperwork,
and then it's the Army's problem.

19:15.761 --> 19:19.458
Hey, you like meatloaf?
They got a killer meatloaf in Ramstein.

19:19.498 --> 19:20.965
–Yeah?
–Oh, yeah.

19:31.543 --> 19:33.374
Where the hell?

19:37.649 --> 19:39.344
Oh, son of a bitch.

19:41.353 --> 19:43.617
So, this is it, lraq,

19:45.625 --> 19:47.855
jewel of the Middle East,

19:47.960 --> 19:49.825
Iand of the Hammurabis.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.127
Iraq? Oh, damn!

19:52.565 --> 19:55.261
Damn! Hey, we're in… Hey!

19:55.368 --> 19:57.598
We're in lraq! Damn!

19:57.704 --> 19:59.069
Get up! Hey!

20:00.640 --> 20:02.267
Bill, we're in…

20:04.744 --> 20:07.473
What in the name of Siegfried and Roy
are you fellas doing?

20:07.513 --> 20:08.980
Don't ask.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.413
Don't tell.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.748
We're in lraq!

20:12.852 --> 20:14.319
We're in lraq!

20:14.854 --> 20:17.483
–All right, now, Larry, calm down.
–Be careful, Everett.

20:17.523 --> 20:19.052
There's a lot of gear scattered around.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.326
Now, listen to me, Larry.
Pull yourself together.

20:22.628 --> 20:24.596
Now, we're in a hot zone.

20:24.731 --> 20:26.995
It's time to take it up a notch.

20:38.478 --> 20:39.775
Shot.

20:41.013 --> 20:44.915
Leave it to Everett
to break the only working radio we got.

20:45.752 --> 20:48.114
They drop us in lraq,
they don't even wake us up.

20:48.154 --> 20:51.685
What the hell are we supposed to do now?
I guarantee you this was Kilgore's idea.

20:51.725 --> 20:53.920
All right, let's calm down.

20:54.328 --> 20:58.625
Let's just regroup while we're here.
Last thing we need to do is panic.

20:58.665 --> 21:00.826
Man down! Man down!

21:00.934 --> 21:03.334
Man down! There's a man down!

21:14.381 --> 21:15.507
Sarge?

21:17.751 --> 21:19.651
I think he's dead, y'all.

21:19.753 --> 21:21.914
K.I.A., man! K.I.A.!

21:23.524 --> 21:24.718
Oh, man.

21:25.959 --> 21:28.052
This is gonna be a lawsuit.

21:35.469 --> 21:36.993
Well,

21:37.104 --> 21:39.480
I guess we ought to say a few words.

21:39.573 --> 21:40.631
Bill?

21:40.741 --> 21:43.335
Me? You were closer to him than I was.

21:43.777 --> 21:44.937
Well,

21:45.345 --> 21:46.812
all right.

21:49.883 --> 21:51.043
Lord,

21:51.653 --> 21:54.884
we ask that you be with Sergeant Kilgore.

21:55.723 --> 22:00.054
Sure, he was a mean bastard, incapable
of establishing normal relationships

22:00.094 --> 22:02.023
with any other human being, and…

22:02.063 --> 22:03.530
Larry.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.060
But, Lord…

22:09.604 --> 22:11.538
–Everett!
–Everett!

22:11.639 --> 22:12.667
What the hell are you doing?

22:12.707 --> 22:15.437
When we run out of water,
we're gonna have to drink our own urine.

22:15.477 --> 22:18.105
Desert warfare 101, man!

22:18.213 --> 22:21.643
Everett, now's not the time
to be talking about bodily functions.

22:21.683 --> 22:24.550
We're talking to the Lord here!

22:25.386 --> 22:27.820
–You want to say a few words?
–Yeah.

22:29.958 --> 22:31.448
Dear Lord,

22:31.559 --> 22:33.789
I ask you to take this man,

22:33.895 --> 22:35.624
for richer or for poorer,

22:35.730 --> 22:39.359
as he walks through the valley
of the shadow of death.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.059
And also, dear Lord,

22:41.169 --> 22:43.347
the Powerball's up to 90 million.

22:43.404 --> 22:46.134
So, if you could help me out,
I sure would appreciate it.

22:46.174 --> 22:47.505
Amen!

22:47.775 --> 22:51.233
–That was just great, Everett.
–Yeah, real touching.

22:53.815 --> 22:55.511
Powerball!

23:35.357 --> 23:37.382
Come on! Get some!

23:37.493 --> 23:38.721
Get some!

23:43.032 --> 23:44.761
All right, ladies,

23:45.901 --> 23:47.960
let's git-r-done.

23:50.139 --> 23:52.937
Operation shock and awe!

23:53.042 --> 23:54.600
Here we go!

23:54.710 --> 23:56.473
Kill, kill, kill!

24:33.917 --> 24:36.477
All right, y'all, let's fan out.

24:38.254 --> 24:42.657
I'll secure the perimeter.
That Charlie's a real sneaky bastard!

24:42.759 --> 24:43.748
Charlie?

24:43.860 --> 24:45.956
You think Everett's mom drank
during pregnancy?

24:45.996 --> 24:49.560
Yeah, and I'm guessing
she sniffed paint thinner, too.

24:58.842 --> 25:01.277
Well, what do we have here?

25:03.114 --> 25:04.547
Damn!

25:04.949 --> 25:07.979
You know who that is?
That's the Butcher of Baghdad, buddy.

25:08.019 --> 25:09.987
That's Saddam Hussein.

25:10.087 --> 25:11.816
He's an ugly son of a bitch, isn't he?

25:11.856 --> 25:14.085
Kind of looks like that fellow
that works the register

25:14.125 --> 25:15.653
down there at the Circle K.

25:15.693 --> 25:17.558
You know, Rugburn.

25:17.662 --> 25:19.129
You mean Raji?

25:20.031 --> 25:22.295
Yeah, that little lndian fella.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.196
He's a red-dot lndian though,
not a tomahawk lndian.

25:25.236 --> 25:27.765
You're crazy.
That don't look nothing like him.

25:27.805 --> 25:30.103
Only an idiot would think that.

25:31.142 --> 25:34.009
Oh, look! It's Raji from Circle K!

25:34.111 --> 25:35.544
Y'all hungry?

25:40.718 --> 25:42.413
What's wrong with it?
Why aren't you eating?

25:42.453 --> 25:44.499
I got spaghetti and meat sauce.

25:44.555 --> 25:45.544
So?

25:46.123 --> 25:48.284
It gives me bad gas.

25:48.693 --> 25:51.787
Fine. Take my beef stew.

25:53.564 --> 25:55.555
Larry, what the hell is that?

25:55.666 --> 25:57.463
I needed a spit cup.

25:59.670 --> 26:01.297
Just eat around it.

26:01.405 --> 26:04.574
That's gross. Come on.
We gotta get on the road.

26:26.364 --> 26:29.561
Why don't you just admit it? We're lost!

26:29.668 --> 26:31.226
He thinks you're lost!

26:31.336 --> 26:34.108
There's a town right over this next ridge!

26:37.209 --> 26:38.176
Wait a minute.

26:38.777 --> 26:39.835
Nope.

26:40.946 --> 26:42.277
We're lost.

26:42.881 --> 26:45.125
Nothing to report from my patrols.

26:45.183 --> 26:47.913
Damn it, I thought
we was gonna be in the shit.

26:47.953 --> 26:49.481
When am I gonna get to shoot somebody?

26:49.521 --> 26:52.150
Everett, there are specific
rules of engagement.

26:52.190 --> 26:53.819
There are friendlies around.

26:53.859 --> 26:56.154
You can't just run around shooting people.

26:56.194 --> 26:58.290
You got your Geneva Convention
to think about.

26:58.330 --> 27:01.026
Rule is you don't fire
unless you're fired upon.

27:01.066 --> 27:03.057
–You understand?
–Yep.

27:12.879 --> 27:16.337
One shot, one kill! Get some!

27:16.449 --> 27:19.485
Damn it, Everett!
What the hell are you doing?

27:19.585 --> 27:20.847
Nice shooting!

27:20.953 --> 27:23.979
Down on your knees,
hands behind your head!

27:28.094 --> 27:31.188
Easy, man! This ain't Cops.

27:31.297 --> 27:34.531
–I was on Cops once. Remember?
–Who could forget?

27:34.567 --> 27:38.003
High speed pursuit
followed by indecent exposure.

27:38.104 --> 27:40.766
That was the best Thanksgiving ever.

27:41.741 --> 27:44.209
All right, assume the position.

27:46.746 --> 27:49.146
Well, congratulations, Everett!

27:49.248 --> 27:51.614
You just killed yourself a donkey.

27:51.884 --> 27:54.447
We don't even know
if they have a donkey season.

27:54.487 --> 27:55.675
What do we do now?

28:03.963 --> 28:07.831
–Come on. Let me blow them both away.
–Calm down, Everett.

28:08.334 --> 28:11.331
I guess since I'm squad leader,
I ought to do the interrogating.

28:11.371 --> 28:15.133
Besides that, everybody knows
I'm a skilled communicator.

28:16.276 --> 28:18.107
Who are you?

28:20.113 --> 28:22.547
Are you Republican Guard?

28:23.417 --> 28:25.442
Larry,

28:25.552 --> 28:27.918
they're not deaf, they're lraqi.

28:28.322 --> 28:32.612
What we need to do is find out
whether they're Turds or Shitites.

28:33.594 --> 28:35.838
I think you mean Kurds or Shiites.

28:47.641 --> 28:48.699
Hi.

28:48.809 --> 28:50.640
My name's Larry.

28:51.745 --> 28:54.145
We're here to liberate your people.

28:55.415 --> 28:58.077
We bring gifts of freedom and democracy.

28:59.887 --> 29:01.946
Oh, sorry about your donkey.

29:11.565 --> 29:13.466
Freedoms?

29:13.668 --> 29:17.126
Freedom. Yeah, right.
We're here to liberate you.

29:17.772 --> 29:19.740
–Freedoms!
–Freedoms!

29:19.841 --> 29:21.240
–Freedoms!
–Freedoms!

29:21.342 --> 29:22.741
Freedom, yeah!

29:22.844 --> 29:24.311
–Freedoms.
–Freedoms.

29:24.412 --> 29:26.209
Freedoms! Freedoms!

29:26.314 --> 29:27.508
Shut up!

29:29.250 --> 29:33.118
Your village?
Is your village named Baslamabad?

29:36.124 --> 29:37.614
Freedoms!

29:37.725 --> 29:41.623
–Yeah, freedoms.
–This is it, fellas. This is our objective.

29:41.663 --> 29:43.654
Get ready to be heroes.

29:43.865 --> 29:48.089
I wish Sarge was here right now.
He'd be so dag-gum proud of us.

29:50.071 --> 29:51.538
It's alive!

29:57.946 --> 29:59.106
Iraq,

30:00.014 --> 30:01.948
it's a land of miracles.

30:16.465 --> 30:18.228
Where the hell am l?

30:21.770 --> 30:23.738
You gotta be shitting me!

30:39.989 --> 30:43.686
Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna kill those miserable pissants!

30:51.300 --> 30:52.995
What do you see?

30:54.169 --> 30:57.229
Not much. I forgot to take off the lens caps.

30:57.706 --> 31:00.573
–And he's in charge.
–I know.

31:04.580 --> 31:05.638
Well?

31:06.081 --> 31:08.043
Iraqi insurgents. Four of them.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.380
Freedoms. Freedoms.

31:09.485 --> 31:12.045
Just hold on, Saddam.

31:13.088 --> 31:16.114
Look, this is what I think we should do.

31:16.225 --> 31:18.554
We just sit tight
until reinforcements get here.

31:18.594 --> 31:20.423
The 101st Airborne is
gonna be here any minute.

31:20.463 --> 31:23.326
These people are in trouble.
I think we're dealing with Fedayin.

31:23.366 --> 31:24.694
Damn right they're in trouble.

31:24.734 --> 31:27.968
I had some of that Fedayin
at the Parthenon Cafe.

31:28.605 --> 31:31.199
Greek food goes right through me.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.299
Irritable bowel syndrome.

31:40.183 --> 31:42.245
It looks like she needs our help.

31:42.285 --> 31:43.309
She?

31:44.487 --> 31:45.954
I mean “they.”

31:48.491 --> 31:51.085
They appear to be C-cups.

31:52.395 --> 31:54.891
All right, listen. Our orders are clear.

31:54.931 --> 31:56.626
We have to engage the enemy.

31:56.666 --> 31:57.963
Gentlemen,

31:58.268 --> 32:00.864
you know what they say
in the Army, Semper fi.

32:00.904 --> 32:03.236
That would be the Marines.

32:05.475 --> 32:07.033
Stay here.

32:07.143 --> 32:09.572
Don't worry about anything.
The cavalry is on the way.

32:09.612 --> 32:11.637
They are? Oh, thank God.

32:12.449 --> 32:16.871
I thought for a second you wanted us
to go down there by ourselves.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.389
When this is over, I am so gonna sue you.

32:27.531 --> 32:30.466
What we need is some fighting music.

32:34.405 --> 32:36.305
What the hell's that?

32:37.541 --> 32:38.735
Hold on.

32:45.916 --> 32:47.474
Here we go.

32:47.585 --> 32:49.212
God bless America!

33:01.265 --> 33:03.260
–Should I shoot?
–Hold your fire!

33:03.300 --> 33:05.496
–Did you say fire?
–I said hold your fire!

33:05.536 --> 33:07.527
All right, I'm gonna fire!

33:08.372 --> 33:10.616
It's Rambo! Let's get out of here!

33:12.343 --> 33:13.776
I'm going in!

33:41.439 --> 33:43.339
On the ground, now!

33:43.441 --> 33:45.421
I'm a trained killing machine!

33:45.510 --> 33:46.977
Everett!

33:47.913 --> 33:50.177
I think you got her, Everett!

33:52.651 --> 33:53.640
Oh.

33:56.588 --> 33:58.419
Where the hell's Larry?

33:59.024 --> 34:01.424
I guess that coward run off, huh?

34:01.526 --> 34:04.760
Not everybody's cut out
for the rigors of combat.

34:06.198 --> 34:08.360
The other three got away,
but I got this guy.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.163
Oh, hey there, Larry.

34:10.668 --> 34:11.929
Thank you for the help, Everett.

34:11.969 --> 34:15.600
I was just telling Bill here,
what a good job you done.

34:19.811 --> 34:22.340
That lraqi is a pretty language, ain't it?

34:22.380 --> 34:24.473
Think they're friendly?

34:24.583 --> 34:26.411
It's a very delicate situation

34:26.451 --> 34:29.514
that calls for the soft touch
of a diplomat, so…

34:29.554 --> 34:31.545
I am your king!

34:31.657 --> 34:33.351
Bow down before me!

34:38.764 --> 34:40.857
Everett, get down from there!

34:47.005 --> 34:49.001
Not just a job, it's an adventure.

34:49.041 --> 34:52.539
Yeah. That's the Navy,
but I know what you're saying.

35:05.925 --> 35:08.301
Wish the Sarge was here to see this.

35:21.240 --> 35:24.342
At least those idiots left me
something to eat.

35:32.519 --> 35:33.850
Oh, Christ!

35:39.293 --> 35:41.591
Oh, I'll be damned! Hey! Hey!

35:42.929 --> 35:44.760
Hey, am I glad to see you!

35:44.865 --> 35:46.162
Hey…

35:46.767 --> 35:49.133
I don't parla any Espanola,

35:49.236 --> 35:52.074
but either of you two amigos
habla Inglese?

35:57.544 --> 35:59.590
I need a ride to the next town.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.875
El ride-o in el car-o to el town-o.

36:06.687 --> 36:07.847
Hey, tequila, eh?

36:07.954 --> 36:09.888
Si. Tequila!

36:09.990 --> 36:11.855
Hey, hey. All right. Okay.

36:16.263 --> 36:17.230
Yeah, well…

36:17.331 --> 36:20.961
You two pissants gonna give me a ride
to the next town?

36:32.012 --> 36:33.070
Oh, good!

36:34.849 --> 36:35.907
Yeah!

36:36.751 --> 36:38.412
You're all right, amigo!

36:38.853 --> 36:39.979
Right on!

36:41.956 --> 36:43.184
Right on!

36:50.031 --> 36:53.194
Hey, Everett, why don't you
go guard the prisoner?

36:53.234 --> 36:54.724
Oh, hell, yeah!

36:59.040 --> 37:01.836
Should we be worried
he's too excited about this?

37:01.876 --> 37:03.036
Probably.

37:04.245 --> 37:05.644
Hey, man,

37:05.747 --> 37:07.237
radio's had it.

37:07.515 --> 37:10.645
And I did a house to house search,
and there ain't nothing close to a phone

37:10.685 --> 37:12.585
in this little podunk town.

37:12.687 --> 37:14.780
–So, what now?
–Well,

37:15.923 --> 37:18.152
reckon we ought to maintain
a defensive posture,

37:18.192 --> 37:20.788
and then hold our position here
in case there's a counterattack.

37:20.828 --> 37:24.195
And then, we'll link up with
some reinforcements.

37:24.632 --> 37:26.027
I don't even know what that means.

37:26.067 --> 37:27.159
I bought it.

37:27.268 --> 37:29.259
You know, I gotta say,

37:29.370 --> 37:30.701
feeling pretty good.

37:30.872 --> 37:32.339
A couple days ago,

37:32.440 --> 37:34.969
I had more problems
than a Cub Scout at the Neverland Ranch,

37:35.009 --> 37:37.071
but now I think I've found my true calling.

37:37.111 --> 37:38.874
Yeah? And what might that be?

37:38.914 --> 37:39.975
Well, think about it.

37:40.015 --> 37:41.346
We're in lraq,

37:41.450 --> 37:43.879
the most dangerous place in the world,

37:43.919 --> 37:46.786
well, except for maybe Detroit,

37:46.889 --> 37:49.985
but the point is, I've been tested
in the crucible of battle,

37:50.025 --> 37:54.447
and my troops seized their objective
and didn't even get a scratch.

37:56.198 --> 37:59.895
I think I'm cut out
for this military stuff after all.

38:03.172 --> 38:06.505
All right, Akmed.
Don't get your burka in a wad.

38:06.642 --> 38:07.700
Jesus.

38:08.477 --> 38:10.472
I thought maybe we'd see
more turbans around here.

38:10.512 --> 38:11.570
Yeah.

38:14.917 --> 38:15.941
Hey!

38:21.089 --> 38:24.086
Boy, them lraqis really know
how to throw a good party.

38:24.126 --> 38:25.093
How are you?

38:25.194 --> 38:26.989
Thank you for saving our village.

38:27.029 --> 38:28.690
Hold on, Abdul! You speak English?

38:28.730 --> 38:31.894
Of course! Many of us do!
You're country is very close to ours.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.729
That's right! Our people are friends

38:33.769 --> 38:35.634
in freedom and democracy.

38:35.737 --> 38:39.696
Oh, right.
We're also very close together literally.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.740
–Somebody ought to get this guy a map.
–Yeah.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.372
Hey, how are you?

38:51.721 --> 38:53.712
Man, that smells delicious!

38:54.190 --> 38:56.553
What do you call this local delicacy?

38:56.593 --> 38:58.720
–Tacos.
–Tacos?

38:58.828 --> 39:00.924
–Si, si. Tacos.
–You got tacos here?

39:00.964 --> 39:02.261
This is…

39:02.365 --> 39:03.793
Who would have thought
they'd have tacos here?

39:03.833 --> 39:07.595
Tell you what, if they got pork rinds,
I'm never leaving.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.201
That's delicious!

39:11.241 --> 39:14.409
You do realize
that's probably a camel ass taco.

39:14.777 --> 39:18.144
I wish my wife could
cook camel ass this good.

39:25.588 --> 39:28.228
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.053
My name is Maria Garcia,

39:30.159 --> 39:34.317
and this is my father, Antonio Garcia,
the mayor of La Miranda.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.291
We owe you our lives.

39:36.399 --> 39:39.229
Thank you for freeing us
from under the thumb of these bandits.

39:39.269 --> 39:40.630
It's been far too long.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.265
Oh, it's our pleasure, Mayor.

39:42.305 --> 39:44.035
Bill Little, U. S. Army.

39:45.209 --> 39:48.707
It's my honor to introduce you
to General Eisenhower.

39:49.046 --> 39:53.336
He's currently the ranking officer
in this theater of operations.

39:54.485 --> 39:56.476
You can just call me Larry.

39:57.721 --> 40:02.181
You answered our prayers today, General,
and you were very brave.

40:02.293 --> 40:05.057
Oh, shoot. It's just part of the job.

40:05.162 --> 40:08.025
This evening is yours.
Our town is your town.

40:08.065 --> 40:10.465
Please, please, enjoy yourselves.

40:20.010 --> 40:22.306
A general?
What the hell did you say that for?

40:22.346 --> 40:25.876
Well, what did you want me to say?
Hey, Maria, meet my buddy, Larry.

40:25.916 --> 40:27.545
He just got fired from Cowboy Franks,

40:27.585 --> 40:29.980
and his girlfriend is carrying
a parolee's baby.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.419
Funny.

40:32.790 --> 40:35.085
I tell you what, though, she is a looker.

40:35.125 --> 40:38.355
You play your cards right,
and you could end up with a war bride.

40:38.395 --> 40:40.590
–War bride?
–Yeah.

40:40.965 --> 40:45.062
It's the right of every American fighting
man to take a wife in a combat zone.

40:45.102 --> 40:48.231
My Uncle Charlie came home
from Korea with one.

40:48.340 --> 40:50.240
Boy, Aunt Rose was pissed.

40:50.809 --> 40:52.537
–Hey, let's have a toast.
–A toast.

40:52.577 --> 40:53.908
The Army…

40:55.013 --> 40:57.948
–Leave the driving to us.
–Good God, man.

40:58.049 --> 40:59.641
That's Greyhound.

41:01.419 --> 41:04.115
Might as well fess up, Haji,

41:04.222 --> 41:09.057
'cause I'm gonna break you down
till I get the truth out of your ass.

41:09.427 --> 41:11.691
I don't know what you want.

41:11.796 --> 41:13.593
I'm just a poor Mexican.

41:13.698 --> 41:16.428
Oh. A foreign fighter, huh?

41:16.534 --> 41:19.059
Well, that's even worse in my book.

41:19.170 --> 41:22.932
I should just ship you off
to Guantanamera Bay right now.

41:24.509 --> 41:26.500
Don't you mean Guantanamo Bay?

41:29.114 --> 41:33.676
Guantanamo, Gorgonzola!
They're all hell-holes, man!

41:33.785 --> 41:36.379
Hey, Everett, I think we ought to…

41:36.488 --> 41:38.316
What the hell are you wearing?

41:38.356 --> 41:39.818
This is my sniper suit.

41:39.858 --> 41:42.253
I'm doing some serious Psyop
shit here, man.

41:42.293 --> 41:45.657
–We weren't issued any sniper gear.
–I brought it from home.

41:45.697 --> 41:48.291
Well, you look like a retard Chewbacca.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.761
How's it going with this guy?

41:49.801 --> 41:52.231
Oh, he's a tough nut to crack,
but I'm gonna bust…

41:52.271 --> 41:53.431
Let me handle it!

41:53.539 --> 41:55.507
I don't know nothing.

41:55.608 --> 41:58.380
Where are the weapons
of mass destruction?

42:00.846 --> 42:04.338
Are you Republican Guard or Al-Qaeda?

42:05.818 --> 42:08.082
Are you a Turd or a Shitite?

42:08.187 --> 42:10.348
Wait a minute. What…

42:10.456 --> 42:12.822
Weapons of mass destruction?

42:15.961 --> 42:18.953
You guys actually think that you're in…

42:23.335 --> 42:25.030
Hey, what's so funny?

42:25.171 --> 42:27.605
You're not in lraq, gringo.

42:30.176 --> 42:31.336
Gringo.

42:32.178 --> 42:34.169
That's what you say in…

42:35.281 --> 42:36.612
Oh, my God!

42:36.782 --> 42:37.908
What?

42:40.252 --> 42:41.742
Are we in France?

42:53.333 --> 42:54.664
Hey, buddy!

42:55.268 --> 42:59.170
This is gonna sound crazy,
but we might be in Mexico!

43:06.680 --> 43:07.669
Oh.

43:08.482 --> 43:10.109
Well, this is bad.

43:10.484 --> 43:12.145
Really bad.

43:12.252 --> 43:14.880
Slow down. It's not that big a deal.

43:14.988 --> 43:17.388
We invaded Mexico.

43:17.591 --> 43:18.819
And we're AWOL.

43:18.925 --> 43:22.122
I mean, that alone is 10 years
in Leavenworth.

43:22.562 --> 43:24.120
I can't do time.

43:24.865 --> 43:26.560
Prison's full of chubby-chasers.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.896
Hope you got smokes.
Cigarettes is currency in the joint, man.

43:29.936 --> 43:33.033
You can't buy a prison bitch or a shank
for anything less than a carton of Kools.

43:33.073 --> 43:36.440
Everett, don't you have something else
to be doing?

43:36.543 --> 43:39.034
Yep. I'll go question the villagers.

43:39.146 --> 43:41.908
See if there's been
any bin Laden sightings.

43:41.948 --> 43:43.711
We're in Mexico!

43:43.817 --> 43:45.148
Roger that.

43:46.453 --> 43:48.080
I'm a screw-up.

43:48.188 --> 43:53.286
I finally found something I was good at,
and what I do, invade a friendly nation.

43:53.326 --> 43:55.886
We were asleep during the drop.

43:55.996 --> 43:58.259
Who's to say the Army
doesn't want us to be here?

43:58.299 --> 44:01.325
Why would they want us here?
This is Mexico.

44:01.669 --> 44:05.605
We committed an act of war
inside a sovereign nation.

44:06.107 --> 44:09.003
This is an international incident
just waiting to happen.

44:09.043 --> 44:11.739
One man's international incident
is another man's preemptive strike

44:11.779 --> 44:13.212
in the war on terror.

44:13.314 --> 44:15.680
Those men weren't terrorists.

44:16.417 --> 44:18.282
Hang on. Tell him, Everett.

44:19.086 --> 44:23.050
The U. S.Government defines terrorism
as the unlawful use or threatened use

44:23.090 --> 44:27.054
of force or violence to intimidate
or coerce governments or societies,

44:27.094 --> 44:30.154
often for ideological or political reasons.

44:31.899 --> 44:34.390
Now, I don't know about you,

44:35.369 --> 44:37.331
but those fellows sound
like terrorists to me.

44:37.371 --> 44:39.267
Hell, my wife could be a terrorist.

44:39.307 --> 44:42.145
Look, man, these people
think we're heroes,

44:42.210 --> 44:44.238
and there's nothing we can do
about it right now.

44:44.278 --> 44:46.407
Eventually, somebody's gonna
come get us.

44:46.447 --> 44:48.376
So, I say we just enjoy ourselves.

44:48.416 --> 44:49.906
Señor Bill?

44:50.017 --> 44:52.747
We have more tacos and cervezas for you.

44:53.120 --> 44:56.146
You see?
If we leave now, the terrorists win.

45:02.097 --> 45:03.992
Everett, where did you get that cannon?

45:04.032 --> 45:07.024
This is an 1875 Napoleon 12-pounder.

45:07.135 --> 45:09.965
Only an amateur like yourself
would call it a cannon.

45:10.005 --> 45:12.530
I found it out behind a barn.

45:12.641 --> 45:15.404
I thought that court order said you
wasn't supposed to be around cannons.

45:15.444 --> 45:16.638
Only in the state of Georgia.

45:16.678 --> 45:18.578
General Eisenhower,

45:18.680 --> 45:20.858
how come you're not at the party?

45:20.949 --> 45:25.833
Oh, I'm just strategizing my next
counteroffensive against the insurgents.

45:26.288 --> 45:28.153
Or something like that.

45:28.891 --> 45:31.325
So, you thought this was lraq.

45:31.894 --> 45:34.488
How can that happen? This is Mexico.

45:34.596 --> 45:38.327
Well, we kind of confused our latitudes
with our longitudes,

45:38.367 --> 45:41.336
and our stalagmites with our stalactites.

45:41.970 --> 45:44.499
–It's a long story.
–Well, I don't care.

45:44.539 --> 45:46.702
You saved our village from those animals.

45:46.742 --> 45:48.937
Yeah, who were those guys?

45:49.077 --> 45:50.977
They are vicious bandidos.

45:51.413 --> 45:55.747
Their leader is a cruel man,
nothing more than a common criminal.

45:55.984 --> 45:58.558
He's preyed upon our village for years,

45:58.587 --> 46:01.650
stealing our crops
and what little else we have.

46:01.690 --> 46:03.486
You think they might be back?

46:03.526 --> 46:06.393
No. They are cowards.

46:06.996 --> 46:10.864
And now we have a brave general here
to protect us.

46:11.601 --> 46:13.535
Well, about that, I'm…

46:13.770 --> 46:16.238
I'm not actually a general.

46:16.339 --> 46:20.332
I am a squad leader though,
and that's pretty high up there.

46:21.077 --> 46:24.741
One day, I hope to travel
across those mountains to the ocean.

46:24.781 --> 46:29.137
And I will open a cantina
on a beautiful beach far away from here.

46:29.385 --> 46:33.477
Well, if you need an assistant manager,
I got some experience.

46:34.357 --> 46:35.847
Maria!

46:36.693 --> 46:38.820
That's my father. I must go.

46:39.462 --> 46:44.346
But perhaps you will allow me the honor
to cook dinner for you some night?

46:44.367 --> 46:46.801
The honor would be all mine.

46:47.403 --> 46:49.462
–Good night.
–Good night.

46:49.806 --> 46:51.034
Oh…

46:51.708 --> 46:54.348
What was the name of that bandit leader?

46:55.411 --> 46:58.380
His name is one that strikes fear

46:58.481 --> 47:01.385
into the hearts
of decent people everywhere.

47:01.451 --> 47:05.217
The bastard's name is Carlos Santana.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.530
Let's get this party started!

47:19.570 --> 47:21.936
Okay, so where's the entertainment?

47:22.373 --> 47:24.136
Bring out the gringo!

47:25.175 --> 47:28.472
El Jefe, I think you're really
going to like this act, Jefe.

47:28.512 --> 47:31.152
We kidnapped him from a hotel in Cancún.

47:31.849 --> 47:35.149
So, without further ado,
por favor, please welcome

47:35.152 --> 47:37.814
the Amazing Ken and Rufus!

47:40.290 --> 47:43.987
Thank you. Quite a crowd.
What do you think, Rufus?

47:44.395 --> 47:46.556
Lots of Mexicans tonight.

47:46.663 --> 47:50.622
Feels like I'm standing
in front of the Home Depot.

47:52.202 --> 47:55.069
Be nice, Rufus. How about a joke?

47:55.172 --> 47:56.161
Okay.

47:56.273 --> 48:01.870
Do you know why there were only
3,000 Mexicans at the Battle of the Alamo?

48:01.979 --> 48:04.971
–No. Why?
–They only had four trucks.

48:05.983 --> 48:07.143
Boo! Boo!

48:07.251 --> 48:08.411
That's not funny!

48:08.586 --> 48:12.716
Relax, sweetheart.
I did not know this was a gay bar.

48:14.292 --> 48:16.226
He's just kidding.

48:16.961 --> 48:19.191
What is your name, sir?

48:19.297 --> 48:21.060
I am Carlos Santana.

48:21.166 --> 48:23.566
Holy shit! The singer?

48:23.835 --> 48:27.566
No, not the singer!
I'm the real Carlos Santana!

48:27.672 --> 48:31.233
Man of courage, honor. The leader of men!

48:31.743 --> 48:34.581
That other guy, he is just a guitar player.

48:34.646 --> 48:37.012
Yeah, well, I think you both suck.

48:40.351 --> 48:42.012
You shot Rufus!

48:43.455 --> 48:46.015
I was aiming for the Amazing Ken.

48:54.032 --> 48:57.263
Luis, you are back.
How did the pillaging go?

48:59.137 --> 49:00.764
Not so good, Jefe.

49:00.905 --> 49:02.700
What do you mean, not so good?

49:02.740 --> 49:04.332
There was a problem.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.937
And we could not get your tribute.

49:05.977 --> 49:06.944
What?

49:07.045 --> 49:10.741
Jefe, you don't understand!
There's nothing we could do.

49:11.082 --> 49:12.799
The American Army show up.

49:14.286 --> 49:16.652
There were hundreds of them.

49:16.755 --> 49:20.847
They captured Ricardo.
Jefe, we barely escaped with our lives.

49:21.527 --> 49:24.018
Gringo soldiers in La Miranda.

49:24.330 --> 49:25.991
It was good you brought me this news.

49:26.031 --> 49:29.133
Since they shut off the cable,
I can't get CNN.

49:29.235 --> 49:30.621
Hard to stay current.

49:31.904 --> 49:34.737
I thought you were going to kill me.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.167
Kill you?

49:37.276 --> 49:40.378
We have shared
many a great adventure together.

49:42.214 --> 49:45.342
I would never kill you.

49:49.321 --> 49:51.829
Paco and Hector are going to kill you.

49:53.125 --> 49:55.387
Jefe, please don't kill me! Jefe! Jefe, no!

49:55.427 --> 49:58.133
Jefe! Are we going to destroy La Miranda?

49:59.765 --> 50:02.328
No, I don't like to work on the weekends.

50:02.368 --> 50:04.996
Tonight, it's karaoke!

50:31.631 --> 50:34.099
What did you guys do last night?

50:34.201 --> 50:36.499
You missed a hell of a party.

50:36.603 --> 50:37.900
You were partying?

50:38.004 --> 50:40.380
It's part of the hero business, man.

50:40.707 --> 50:43.603
For us not to partake in the celebration
would have just been rude.

50:43.643 --> 50:44.610
Relax.

50:44.911 --> 50:48.308
We're goodwill ambassadors
winning over hearts and minds.

50:48.348 --> 50:51.912
Everett, that's exactly why
you shouldn't drink tequila.

50:51.952 --> 50:53.010
Damn.

50:53.787 --> 50:56.722
This always happens when I eat the worm.

50:56.823 --> 50:58.313
Where were you?

50:59.993 --> 51:03.029
You went and saw
that little girl, didn't you?

51:03.897 --> 51:05.292
Did y'all do the chimichanga?

51:05.332 --> 51:07.827
Oh, come on, Bill. Don't be crude, man.

51:07.867 --> 51:10.397
Larry's a gentleman, and Maria's a lady.

51:10.437 --> 51:12.029
Did you bang her?

51:12.172 --> 51:16.836
All right, listen, I was up all night thinking
about our situation.

51:16.943 --> 51:20.508
We just can't be running around
a country we're not supposed to be in.

51:20.548 --> 51:24.011
So, I think we ought to just stay right here
and wait for the Army to pick us up.

51:24.051 --> 51:25.848
–So, we're staying?
–Relax.

51:25.953 --> 51:27.882
This ain't the infield at Talladega.

51:27.922 --> 51:29.480
Since we're stuck here,

51:29.590 --> 51:32.386
I figure we ought to do
what we're supposed to do.

51:32.426 --> 51:35.223
And these folks have
been pretty hospitable.

51:35.263 --> 51:39.751
I think it's time we return the favor.
So, come on, let's get to it.

51:42.103 --> 51:46.472
–You want to change there, señorita?
–Oh, I forgot I had this on.

51:46.574 --> 51:48.132
It really breathes.

51:49.043 --> 51:52.376
Iraq? You guys may want to buy a map, eh?

51:52.480 --> 51:54.880
But what my father means to say

51:54.982 --> 51:56.811
is that we are really appreciative

51:56.851 --> 51:59.046
for what you have done
for our poor village.

51:59.086 --> 52:00.815
We know we messed up,

52:01.722 --> 52:04.418
and kind of hoping
we can keep this our little secret.

52:04.458 --> 52:06.654
We'd like to stick around
and provide perimeter security

52:06.694 --> 52:08.022
and help restore your infrastructure.

52:08.062 --> 52:10.292
Infrastructure? Okay!

52:10.398 --> 52:12.827
First place you can start is this well.

52:12.867 --> 52:14.494
It's been dry for years.

52:14.602 --> 52:17.696
We're forced to carry water from the river.

52:17.805 --> 52:19.363
Yeah. No problem.

52:19.473 --> 52:21.738
Thank you for your generosity.

52:22.844 --> 52:24.471
My pleasure, ma'am.

52:24.579 --> 52:27.104
Here's the problem with the well.

52:28.650 --> 52:29.878
It's dry.

52:54.509 --> 52:57.501
That's right, boys! Can't hate number 8!

53:13.929 --> 53:15.362
They love it!

53:29.512 --> 53:30.907
Hey, where'd you get all those extra nails?

53:30.947 --> 53:33.609
I just pulled them out of that old shed.

53:37.653 --> 53:38.847
Everett!

53:51.234 --> 53:53.262
You know, we're doing a lot of good.

53:53.302 --> 53:55.431
They could really use
these medical supplies.

53:55.471 --> 53:56.904
Copy that.

54:00.109 --> 54:03.078
Oh, man. Guys, you gotta see this.

54:08.618 --> 54:10.552
What do you think happened?

54:10.653 --> 54:12.086
I don't know.

54:12.622 --> 54:14.717
Maybe some wild critters dug him up.

54:14.757 --> 54:17.397
I think it's a more logical explanation.

54:18.394 --> 54:19.691
The Chupacabra.

54:19.862 --> 54:21.625
–What?
–The Chupacabra.

54:21.731 --> 54:23.726
It's a mythical hairless dog-like creature

54:23.766 --> 54:26.162
that sucks the blood out
of both man and beast.

54:26.202 --> 54:28.832
It's been terrorizing these parts for years.

54:28.872 --> 54:30.167
Either that, or it's grave robbers.

54:30.207 --> 54:34.497
I mean, you can get top dollar
for a testicle on eBay these days.

54:35.379 --> 54:38.151
Poor bastard. Couldn't even rest in peace.

54:55.599 --> 54:58.090
I am gonna kill you deviant bastards!

55:22.493 --> 55:25.018
What are you doing, Señor Bill?

55:25.128 --> 55:29.593
Trying to get this dang radio working.
I need to talk to my superior.

55:29.633 --> 55:32.501
Well, why don't you just use a telephone?

55:33.137 --> 55:34.695
You got a phone?

55:34.806 --> 55:38.799
Well, not here in town,
but I can show you where.

55:41.846 --> 55:43.808
Now, we need to keep this
between you and l.

55:43.848 --> 55:47.011
See, it's a covert op, and we don't want
General Larry interfering.

55:47.051 --> 55:50.515
Why wouldn't you want him to know?
I thought you had to call your superior.

55:50.555 --> 55:52.750
I do. My wife.

55:53.258 --> 55:54.691
Oh, si, Señor Bill.

55:55.326 --> 55:56.918
It will be our secret.

55:57.028 --> 55:59.668
Good. Now, where the hell is this phone?

56:02.867 --> 56:04.698
Shut up in there! Hello?

56:04.802 --> 56:06.463
Hey, sweetie! It's me!

56:06.571 --> 56:09.067
Why haven't you called? Are you in Iraq?

56:09.107 --> 56:11.803
No. No, we had a little change of plans.

56:11.910 --> 56:13.004
This better be good.

56:13.044 --> 56:15.306
Yeah, it's actually a pretty funny story.

56:15.346 --> 56:16.908
Quiet in there! I'm talking to your dad!

56:16.948 --> 56:18.506
We're in Mexico.

56:18.783 --> 56:21.012
Mexico? You better get
your ass right back here…

56:21.052 --> 56:23.098
–Señor Bill?
–Hang on a second.

56:23.154 --> 56:24.649
A two-way whore in a rowdy…

56:24.689 --> 56:27.485
No, no, no, no.
Now, you hold on a second, honey.

56:27.525 --> 56:30.522
It's not like that at all.
I'm not on vacation down here.

56:30.562 --> 56:32.891
Damn right you're not on vacation.
What are you doing down there?

56:32.931 --> 56:34.229
I'm working!

56:34.333 --> 56:37.129
Hey, this is part
of a government sanctioned incursion

56:37.169 --> 56:39.865
into a sovereign nation
as part of Operation Sombrero.

56:39.905 --> 56:41.000
You're a part of a government operation?

56:41.040 --> 56:43.702
Yeah. Yeah, so, tell the boys,
their daddy is a hero.

56:43.742 --> 56:45.369
Señor Bill?

56:45.477 --> 56:46.599
Hang on a second!

56:46.645 --> 56:47.907
Are you coming home or not?

56:47.947 --> 56:50.587
No. I don't know when I'm gonna be home.

56:50.649 --> 56:52.299
Well, I don't know. Hell.

56:52.318 --> 56:54.013
–Wrong!
–Hello?

56:54.119 --> 56:55.450
Connie?

56:55.554 --> 56:56.612
Hello.

56:57.823 --> 57:00.883
–Hey, what is…
–Oh, I'm sorry, señor.

57:00.993 --> 57:02.756
Did I cut you off?

57:10.636 --> 57:11.830
Shit.

57:11.937 --> 57:13.404
Okay, gringo,

57:13.505 --> 57:16.035
how many more men you
got back in La Miranda?

57:16.075 --> 57:19.638
All I gotta tell you
is my name, rank, and favorite cereal.

57:19.678 --> 57:22.044
And that's all you're getting.

57:24.249 --> 57:26.547
I think Ruben likes you.

57:28.153 --> 57:31.452
It just seems odd that a man of your stature

57:31.557 --> 57:34.787
would embrace alternative lifestyles
amongst his men.

57:34.827 --> 57:37.390
You can't fire someone
because they're gay!

57:37.430 --> 57:39.398
That's discrimination!

57:39.499 --> 57:41.194
You can get sued for that, eh?

57:41.234 --> 57:43.361
Besides, he's my nephew.

57:43.470 --> 57:45.734
You can't choose your familia.

57:46.339 --> 57:49.308
So, he's here, he's queer. Get used to it.

57:49.409 --> 57:52.503
I'm still not telling you anything.

57:52.612 --> 57:55.979
Start talking or I'll tell Ruben
he can marry you.

57:56.082 --> 57:57.640
He wants a wife.

57:58.918 --> 58:01.443
Well, there's just three of us.

58:01.554 --> 58:03.883
We don't have an idea what we're doing.
We thought this was lraq.

58:03.923 --> 58:05.151
Can you believe that? Iraq.

58:05.191 --> 58:07.716
Who would make that stupid mistake?

58:08.528 --> 58:10.824
You and you men
have really done some good here.

58:10.864 --> 58:14.227
Oh, well, just goes to show you
what a little hard work

58:14.267 --> 58:15.996
and ingenuity can do.

58:16.236 --> 58:18.732
You must have learned
so much in the Army.

58:18.772 --> 58:22.336
Oh, shoot, yeah.
We're all highly-trained individuals.

58:22.609 --> 58:26.306
Hey, Larry! Help me out with this thing!

58:26.413 --> 58:28.347
Well, most of us, anyway.

58:28.448 --> 58:31.682
–I better handle this. I'll see you later.
–Okay.

58:40.428 --> 58:42.328
I think I got it now.

58:47.635 --> 58:49.664
Look out, you idiot! Not at the village!

58:49.704 --> 58:51.899
–Oh, yeah.
–Turn it!

58:54.341 --> 58:55.672
Stand back!

58:58.312 --> 59:01.042
Damn it! That's been happening all day!

59:01.148 --> 59:02.843
I don't get it.

59:04.585 --> 59:07.753
I'm gonna get this thing working
if it kills me.

59:10.257 --> 59:14.019
–Damn it. Come on, Everett!
–I'm right behind you, buddy!

59:14.795 --> 59:15.989
Damn!

59:24.972 --> 59:26.735
People of La Miranda,

59:27.341 --> 59:31.072
you have disobeyed your Jefe
by not paying my tribute.

59:31.178 --> 59:34.079
Now, come out and take your punishment!

59:34.648 --> 59:36.513
Hold it right there!

59:36.617 --> 59:39.747
You're in a lot of trouble, gringo!
This is not lraq!

59:39.787 --> 59:41.118
I am the law here!

59:41.222 --> 59:43.316
I am Carlos Santana!

59:45.060 --> 59:46.391
The singer?

59:46.495 --> 59:48.861
Definitely not the singer.

59:50.766 --> 59:53.361
We caught your friend here
trying to call his wife.

59:53.401 --> 59:54.732
What?

59:54.836 --> 59:57.365
You found a phone,
and the one person you call is your wife?

59:57.405 --> 59:59.501
She gets moody if I don't check in.

59:59.541 --> 01:00:01.670
She sounds like a real bitch, señor.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:04.076
You have to set some boundaries.

01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:07.209
All right, turn him loose!

01:00:07.249 --> 01:00:09.979
Turn him loose?
We have you outnumbered.

01:00:10.085 --> 01:00:13.782
What are you gonna do,
kill us all by yourself?

01:00:14.923 --> 01:00:15.981
Nope.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:20.291
I'm just gonna kill you.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:23.219
Oh.

01:00:23.799 --> 01:00:25.596
I hadn't thought of that.

01:00:26.067 --> 01:00:29.901
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a Mexican standoff.

01:00:31.573 --> 01:00:34.803
Actually, señor,
down here, we just call it a standoff.

01:00:34.843 --> 01:00:36.071
Yeah, okay.

01:00:36.678 --> 01:00:38.273
Tell your people to stand back.

01:00:38.313 --> 01:00:39.405
This is my town!

01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:41.956
You don't give the orders here, I do!

01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:47.583
In just a few minutes,
the entire 101st Airborne

01:00:47.623 --> 01:00:49.537
is gonna come down that road.

01:00:49.759 --> 01:00:50.987
They are?

01:00:51.627 --> 01:00:53.618
Just go with me on this.

01:00:54.497 --> 01:00:56.692
Señor, I think you're bluffing!

01:01:09.078 --> 01:01:11.308
Iraq, it's a land of miracles.

01:01:12.148 --> 01:01:13.376
Sarge? You're alive?

01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:15.316
Shut up, numb nuts.

01:01:17.353 --> 01:01:19.685
Surprised to see me, maggots?

01:01:19.956 --> 01:01:22.823
Can we sort this out later, Sarge?

01:01:23.092 --> 01:01:26.856
–Little bit of a situation on our hands.
–You bet your ass we got a situation.

01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:29.160
You assholes are A-W-O-L!

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.558
What?

01:01:32.668 --> 01:01:36.299
I was just telling these armed men,
the rest of our highly-trained

01:01:36.339 --> 01:01:40.236
firepower-out-the-ass 101st Airborne
was coming up right behind you.

01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:41.743
Are you nuts?

01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:43.929
We're not even in lraq.

01:01:43.946 --> 01:01:46.244
There's no one here! We're alone.

01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:48.249
Now give me that weapon.

01:01:50.287 --> 01:01:51.982
This shit-hole of a country is Mexico.

01:01:52.022 --> 01:01:53.011
Hey!

01:01:53.123 --> 01:01:56.587
You're not exactly a box of chocolates,
eh, sweetheart?

01:01:56.627 --> 01:01:58.422
Mind your own business, Pedro.

01:01:58.462 --> 01:02:01.795
Actually, señor, this is my business.

01:02:05.669 --> 01:02:06.897
Oh, shit.

01:02:15.012 --> 01:02:16.992
Put your hands in the air now!

01:02:17.047 --> 01:02:18.609
You have the right to remain silent!

01:02:18.649 --> 01:02:20.010
You have the right to an attorney!

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:21.677
What the hell is that?

01:02:21.785 --> 01:02:25.943
This is a Mark 153 shoulder-launch
multipurpose assault weapon.

01:02:27.791 --> 01:02:29.969
Who wants to ride the pain train?

01:02:32.062 --> 01:02:36.624
Well, boys, looks like we got ourselves
a Mexican standoff.

01:02:39.403 --> 01:02:42.032
Hey, Sarge. You still got your testicles?

01:02:42.072 --> 01:02:43.867
Everett? Everett, hand that thing over.

01:02:43.907 --> 01:02:44.935
–No, I can do it.
–Hand it over.

01:02:44.975 --> 01:02:46.036
I'm a trained law enforcement officer.

01:02:46.076 --> 01:02:47.170
You're gonna hurt somebody.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:48.370
Watch and learn!

01:02:48.478 --> 01:02:49.843
Everett, no!

01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:55.547
Incoming!

01:03:27.085 --> 01:03:28.416
Hell, yeah!

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:43.994
That's what I'm talking about!

01:03:49.907 --> 01:03:54.858
Not only have you saved us again,
but you've given us the miracle of water.

01:03:55.881 --> 01:03:58.475
–Nice shooting, Everett.
–I know.

01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:02.808
You know what they say?
The Army, toughest job you'll ever love.

01:04:02.855 --> 01:04:05.085
No, that's the Peace Corps.

01:04:06.291 --> 01:04:07.553
Hey!

01:04:07.659 --> 01:04:08.583
Where's Sarge?

01:04:08.994 --> 01:04:10.393
God damn it, Everett!

01:04:10.496 --> 01:04:13.225
I'm gonna tear off your head
and shit down your…

01:04:13.265 --> 01:04:16.098
Say hello to my nephew Ruben.

01:04:20.272 --> 01:04:21.330
Shit.

01:04:24.276 --> 01:04:27.143
Do you really think this is a good idea?

01:04:27.246 --> 01:04:29.708
I mean, we've already buried Sarge once,

01:04:29.748 --> 01:04:33.047
and I don't know
if I can go through this again,

01:04:33.185 --> 01:04:34.914
emotionally speaking.

01:04:35.054 --> 01:04:38.546
Look, he may be an asshole,
but he's our asshole.

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:43.355
Everett, what are you doing?

01:04:43.395 --> 01:04:46.992
I'm changing the terror level
from orange to red piñata.

01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:48.659
Everett, get down!

01:04:50.903 --> 01:04:54.498
Are you sure you must do this?
This is not your fight.

01:04:54.606 --> 01:04:58.237
Look, once they messed with Sarge,
it became our fight.

01:05:05.752 --> 01:05:07.379
Bin Laden, here we come!

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:09.785
Shut up, Everett.

01:05:13.193 --> 01:05:14.387
Lock up the prisoner!

01:05:14.427 --> 01:05:17.265
Jefe, are we going
to burn down La Miranda?

01:05:17.397 --> 01:05:19.592
Tonight it's wrestling!

01:05:22.235 --> 01:05:23.293
Yeah!

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:25.801
El Javalina!

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:29.202
Who's he fighting, Jefe?

01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:31.300
You and Hector.

01:05:31.411 --> 01:05:33.072
But, Jefe…

01:05:34.247 --> 01:05:35.976
I would love to.

01:05:41.387 --> 01:05:43.616
All right. Does everybody know the plan?

01:05:43.656 --> 01:05:44.714
Yeah.

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.317
Affirmative.

01:05:46.426 --> 01:05:48.621
Crack skulls and kick ass!

01:05:53.266 --> 01:05:56.724
Well, we may never see him again.

01:05:56.836 --> 01:05:59.737
I'm gonna miss that little mongoloid.

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:03.367
You disable the vehicles.
I'm gonna get Sarge.

01:06:07.214 --> 01:06:09.722
Boy, am I glad to see a friendly face.

01:06:10.851 --> 01:06:14.315
I have had the darnedest time
ever since I left the interstate.

01:06:14.355 --> 01:06:17.654
I think we took a wrong
turn at buenas noches.

01:06:18.859 --> 01:06:20.383
What you have to do is…

01:06:20.494 --> 01:06:23.156
That's what I need to do right there.

01:06:41.382 --> 01:06:43.748
I'm getting too fat for this shit.

01:07:08.977 --> 01:07:10.706
Electric shock, huh?

01:07:11.313 --> 01:07:13.281
Well, in the Mekong Delta,

01:07:13.381 --> 01:07:17.010
the Vietcong stuck bamboo shoots
under my fingernails.

01:07:17.152 --> 01:07:20.056
It'll take a lot more than that to break me.

01:07:20.989 --> 01:07:22.752
What the hell is this?

01:07:28.763 --> 01:07:30.128
It's a duet!

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:03.964
Hey, hey, hey!

01:08:33.828 --> 01:08:36.957
Who else is man enough
to step into the ring?

01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:38.962
Right here, amigo!

01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:40.691
Who is this maricón?

01:08:40.803 --> 01:08:42.202
I don't know,

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:43.961
but I like him.

01:08:53.549 --> 01:08:55.176
He's got style!

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:59.877
Muchachos, a masked challenger
is gonna take on El Javalina.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:10.461
Hold on, Sarge. I'm coming.

01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:18.268
Come on, Tijuana! You want some?

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:19.808
You gonna get some!

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:22.038
Hey, don't you worry about anything, man.
I'm a pro.

01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:23.307
I'm a card-carrying member

01:09:23.346 --> 01:09:25.908
of the Georgia
lndependent Wrestling Alliance.

01:09:25.948 --> 01:09:28.509
Just take a lookout for my trick knee.

01:09:51.006 --> 01:09:53.569
Man, look at the size of that son of a bitch.

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:56.408
–He'd have ripped you a…
–Get me loose!

01:09:59.116 --> 01:10:00.583
I hate Sonny and Cher.

01:10:00.684 --> 01:10:03.113
Hey, Bill's down by the gate.
I'm gonna go get Everett.

01:10:03.153 --> 01:10:04.142
Okay.

01:10:09.259 --> 01:10:10.692
What are you doing?

01:10:10.794 --> 01:10:12.125
Hey, Sarge.

01:10:12.829 --> 01:10:16.594
You're wearing the enemy's uniform.
I should have known you'd be a traitor.

01:10:16.634 --> 01:10:18.158
No, I'm undercover.

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:21.762
I'm wrecking the vehicles. Here's the plan.

01:10:22.006 --> 01:10:24.497
I'm putting sugar in their gas tanks.

01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:28.242
I got a better idea.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.972
Okay.

01:10:53.037 --> 01:10:54.026
Oh!

01:10:54.205 --> 01:10:57.307
I see we're playing
by Panamanian prison rules.

01:11:05.483 --> 01:11:08.418
Yeah, take some of this, amigo!

01:11:22.367 --> 01:11:25.397
You just bought yourself
a six pack of pain, buddy!

01:11:25.437 --> 01:11:27.302
Come get some!

01:11:34.079 --> 01:11:36.775
I'm the king! I'm the king!

01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:49.256
Get set for the full force of the U. S. Military!

01:11:49.361 --> 01:11:51.124
Get them, guys!

01:11:53.465 --> 01:11:54.523
Guys?

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.131
I know you!

01:11:56.301 --> 01:11:59.168
You're that retarded guy with the bazooka!

01:11:59.271 --> 01:12:00.732
It was a rocket-launcher.

01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:02.364
Kill this cabrón!

01:12:04.776 --> 01:12:06.403
Hold it right there!

01:12:06.512 --> 01:12:08.776
You gotta be kidding me!

01:12:09.081 --> 01:12:11.977
You gringos are like
a bad case of the crabs.

01:12:12.017 --> 01:12:13.445
I can't get rid of you!

01:12:13.485 --> 01:12:15.476
Everett, get over here.

01:12:17.823 --> 01:12:22.318
You, señor, are either very brave
or very stupid.

01:12:22.428 --> 01:12:24.919
Either way, you can't kill all of us.

01:12:25.532 --> 01:12:26.965
Probably not.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.893
I'll just kill you.

01:12:30.136 --> 01:12:32.627
Damn! I keep doing that.

01:12:32.739 --> 01:12:34.604
Good job, Larry.

01:12:34.707 --> 01:12:36.885
I'm out of here. You disarm them,

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.880
and I'll meet you back
at Checkpoint Charlie.

01:12:41.548 --> 01:12:44.320
All right, come on! Let's get out of here!

01:12:54.827 --> 01:12:56.727
Let's go! Shotgun!

01:12:56.829 --> 01:12:58.660
Damn you, Everett!

01:13:09.475 --> 01:13:11.170
They're over there!

01:13:16.349 --> 01:13:18.840
Look at our cars, Jefe.

01:13:18.952 --> 01:13:20.852
Who would do such a thing?

01:13:20.987 --> 01:13:22.683
That's vandalism!

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:25.286
Saddle up the horses
and bring out Big Bertha!

01:13:25.326 --> 01:13:27.226
Come on! Move, move, move!

01:13:27.328 --> 01:13:28.516
Come on! Let's go!

01:13:28.562 --> 01:13:29.722
Go! Go!

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:32.424
This is the end of La Miranda.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.498
You made it back.

01:13:43.577 --> 01:13:45.539
I'm so glad. I was very worried.

01:13:45.579 --> 01:13:48.375
There's still a certain señorita
I gotta take out on the town.

01:13:48.415 --> 01:13:51.178
Or make sweet, sweet love to her
under the stars

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:56.178
as a mariachi bands serenades you
with a song of romance and desire.

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:59.119
You saved our village
by killing Carlos Santana.

01:13:59.159 --> 01:14:01.320
Well, not quite.

01:14:01.428 --> 01:14:03.390
Son, make it quick. We gotta get going.

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:05.921
What? We can't leave.

01:14:06.367 --> 01:14:08.762
Santana might be
on his way down here right now,

01:14:08.802 --> 01:14:10.731
and this village is defenseless.

01:14:10.771 --> 01:14:15.127
Son, you showed me something
by coming to save me, you really did.

01:14:15.209 --> 01:14:18.245
But this is out of my hands.
We have to leave.

01:14:18.545 --> 01:14:20.536
–Bill?
–This isn't lraq.

01:14:20.648 --> 01:14:22.115
It's Mexico.

01:14:22.216 --> 01:14:25.112
We did what we could do,
but this isn't our fight.

01:14:25.152 --> 01:14:26.450
Sorry, son.

01:14:27.055 --> 01:14:28.111
I'm not leaving.

01:14:28.123 --> 01:14:29.284
Oh, Larry, come on!

01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:31.690
Private, I'm giving you an order.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.129
I think you guys forgot what our orders are.

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.092
We're supposed to bring
freedom and democracy

01:14:37.132 --> 01:14:38.997
to people that need it.

01:14:39.467 --> 01:14:41.992
I think these people need it.

01:14:42.704 --> 01:14:44.069
I'm staying.

01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:48.698
I'm staying to finish the job.
I'm staying to do what's right.

01:14:53.048 --> 01:14:57.075
Anybody that's with me can cross this line.

01:14:58.586 --> 01:15:00.645
Oh, come on, guys!

01:15:01.723 --> 01:15:05.989
Sarge, look at these people.
They're honest, hardworking.

01:15:07.262 --> 01:15:09.662
They got hopes, dreams.

01:15:10.665 --> 01:15:12.860
Ain't you ever had a dream?

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:14.195
Shit.

01:15:15.003 --> 01:15:16.595
Hell, you got me.

01:15:19.207 --> 01:15:22.177
I always wanted to be
an aerobics instructor.

01:15:22.544 --> 01:15:23.533
Okay.

01:15:27.248 --> 01:15:30.680
Don't look at me, man.
I got a wife and kids to think about.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.216
And what would you do if Connie
and the boys lived in a town like this?

01:15:34.256 --> 01:15:36.224
Would you leave them then?

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.949
No.

01:15:39.929 --> 01:15:41.123
Damn it.

01:15:42.932 --> 01:15:44.229
All right.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.400
Like they say in the Army,
be all you can be.

01:15:49.305 --> 01:15:51.102
You got it right!

01:15:53.309 --> 01:15:55.471
Who am I kidding?
I live in a storage locker.

01:15:55.511 --> 01:15:57.274
I'm not going anywhere.

01:15:57.379 --> 01:16:00.877
All right, then.
We got all day to figure out a plan.

01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:03.292
Come on, we're the Sleeping Marmots!

01:16:03.385 --> 01:16:05.649
What else can Santana do to us?

01:16:06.455 --> 01:16:09.953
Señor! Señor!
I think you better take a look at this.

01:16:23.806 --> 01:16:25.364
A tank?

01:16:25.474 --> 01:16:26.926
Where'd they get that?

01:16:28.177 --> 01:16:30.949
That's a Sherman tank, U. S. Army surplus!

01:16:31.447 --> 01:16:35.178
Back in the '80s, the Mexicans traded
15,000 cases of Chiclets for them.

01:16:35.218 --> 01:16:36.742
You're kidding!

01:16:36.987 --> 01:16:38.215
Incoming!

01:16:41.258 --> 01:16:42.316
Down!

01:16:51.034 --> 01:16:52.062
Get everybody in the church!

01:16:52.102 --> 01:16:53.933
–But what about…
–Now!

01:17:02.946 --> 01:17:04.274
We gotta take that tank out.

01:17:04.314 --> 01:17:05.675
Get the rocket-launcher!

01:17:05.715 --> 01:17:08.377
I got it, Sarge! It's in the bunkhouse!

01:17:08.785 --> 01:17:10.252
Cover him.

01:17:21.464 --> 01:17:23.762
If I die, Connie's gonna kill me!

01:17:23.867 --> 01:17:25.801
We gotta take that tank out!

01:17:25.902 --> 01:17:29.004
Don't we have anything
in this town we can use?

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.832
Cover me!

01:17:32.943 --> 01:17:34.035
Cover me!

01:17:34.144 --> 01:17:36.545
You heard the man! Cover him!

01:17:39.183 --> 01:17:40.741
I said cover me!

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.712
Bitch!

01:18:05.943 --> 01:18:07.137
Come on!

01:18:09.013 --> 01:18:10.241
Come on!

01:18:11.849 --> 01:18:14.079
Damn it! Come on!

01:18:22.126 --> 01:18:24.686
Shit. That'll work.

01:18:35.072 --> 01:18:39.169
It is time for us to stand up to Santana
once and for all!

01:18:47.452 --> 01:18:49.317
Come on! Let's get them!

01:18:49.755 --> 01:18:51.746
Remember the Alamo!

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:54.629
That is a sore subject around here, señor.

01:19:17.716 --> 01:19:19.911
We did it. We ran them off!

01:19:20.385 --> 01:19:24.219
–Where's Maria?
–Oh, General, Santana has taken her.

01:19:26.124 --> 01:19:28.354
You have any more daughters?

01:19:29.027 --> 01:19:30.187
Lupita.

01:19:31.663 --> 01:19:33.358
I'll go find Maria.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.190
Stupid gringos.

01:19:36.568 --> 01:19:38.263
They may have won this battle,

01:19:38.303 --> 01:19:41.762
but as usual,
Carlos Santana will win the war.

01:19:41.874 --> 01:19:43.205
Far enough!

01:19:43.676 --> 01:19:45.166
Now let her go!

01:19:46.612 --> 01:19:48.841
What do you see in this fat redneck?

01:19:48.881 --> 01:19:50.849
Fat redneck?

01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:54.184
I swear, on Monday,
I'm starting a low-carb diet.

01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:58.119
Now I'll have to kill both of you.

01:20:01.828 --> 01:20:06.629
It will take more than one helicopter
to defeat Carlos Santana!

01:20:09.335 --> 01:20:11.098
This is not good.

01:20:41.968 --> 01:20:42.935
Thank you.

01:20:44.405 --> 01:20:46.566
Papa! Oh, thank God!

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.936
Look forward and come this way, please!

01:20:48.976 --> 01:20:50.296
Hey, everybody okay?

01:20:50.344 --> 01:20:51.972
Oh, sure. Everybody's fine.

01:20:52.012 --> 01:20:53.377
Couldn't be better.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.469
Bill got shot.

01:20:54.581 --> 01:20:56.412
Bill got… What?

01:20:59.386 --> 01:21:01.616
Bill! You all right?

01:21:02.089 --> 01:21:05.718
They got me!
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

01:21:05.959 --> 01:21:07.153
Larry…

01:21:08.295 --> 01:21:10.456
You tell them my story.

01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:16.763
He was shot in the ass. He'll be fine.

01:21:18.639 --> 01:21:20.734
–Sir.
–Colonel Dalton, Delta Force.

01:21:20.774 --> 01:21:22.742
Is there a Bill Little here?

01:21:22.843 --> 01:21:24.003
Yeah. That's me.

01:21:24.111 --> 01:21:26.006
Your wife's a real pain in the ass.

01:21:26.046 --> 01:21:29.076
When she found out you were in Mexico,
she started calling the Pentagon.

01:21:29.116 --> 01:21:31.879
Wouldn't stop till the Joint Chiefs
sent us down here to get you.

01:21:31.919 --> 01:21:33.347
God, I love that woman.

01:21:33.387 --> 01:21:37.323
Yeah. You better mow the lawn
when you get home.

01:21:37.424 --> 01:21:38.857
Yes, sir.

01:21:39.326 --> 01:21:42.289
Hey, Larry, this guy wants to talk to you.
Says he's from the State Department.

01:21:42.329 --> 01:21:46.197
Roger Grabowski,
undersecretary, Central American affairs.

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:49.759
You hear that? Poor bastard's a secretary.

01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:52.667
Bit of a sticky situation we've got here.

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:55.175
We're in a lot of trouble, ain't we?

01:21:55.276 --> 01:21:57.574
Maybe not. That is,

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.704
if you guys will cooperate.

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:02.763
We're all about cooperation.

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:05.251
Another victory in the war on terror

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.715
as the White House today
announced the success

01:22:07.755 --> 01:22:09.552
of Operation Sombrero

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:13.221
with strikes against terror camps
located in northern Mexico

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:17.792
by U. S. personnel operating with
permission from the Mexican government.

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:21.529
In a shocking development,
among those captured in the attack

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:24.732
was Grammy-winning musician,
Carlos Santana,

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:27.402
known for such hits
as Black Magic Woman,

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.070
Evil Ways, and Oye Como Va.

01:22:31.913 --> 01:22:36.646
Once more, America is in need
of its best and brightest.

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:42.149
One wonders if there are still heroes
willing to lead us

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:45.095
through the challenges we face as a nation.

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:47.127
I say the answer is yes.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:51.694
And I am proud to be standing
here with them today

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:53.529
as we honor their sacrifice.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:54.866
Ten hut!

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:08.849
What's my name?

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:10.748
Sergeant Kilgore, sir!

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.925
You will be a mean, lean fighting machine.

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:15.920
One, two, three!

01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:17.458
Move it, fat buddy!

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.870
Oh, yeah! That's the way I like it!

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:34.270
Get some!

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.926
Hey!

01:23:58.301 --> 01:23:59.859
Stop it! Stop it!

01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:03.970
I'm a government employee!
You can't do this!

01:24:04.641 --> 01:24:05.895
Here you go, honey.

01:24:13.883 --> 01:24:17.513
Oh, I wish I had a thousand of them
just like you, son.

01:24:17.654 --> 01:24:21.416
Any chance I can convince you
to come back to Washington?

01:24:22.826 --> 01:24:25.268
Actually, General, I got other plans.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.889
Mr Chile, would you like to sing a song?

01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:55.014
Yes!

01:24:56.427 --> 01:24:59.828
Why don't you sing something
by Carlos Santana?

01:25:00.097 --> 01:25:01.655
Okay.

01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:28.681
–You sing very good.
–Thank you.

01:25:29.293 --> 01:25:31.922
–What did you think of the last guy?
–I did not like the last guy.

01:25:31.962 --> 01:25:33.054
–No?
–No.

01:25:33.164 --> 01:25:34.792
He was squeezing my stick.

01:25:34.832 --> 01:25:37.061
All right, you're gonna love this. Pull!

01:25:37.101 --> 01:25:38.693
Lace thong.

01:25:40.171 --> 01:25:42.503
Wait a second. Those are mine!

01:25:42.606 --> 01:25:44.302
When you address me, you will address me

01:25:44.342 --> 01:25:46.850
as Sergeant… What is my name? Kilgore!

01:25:46.877 --> 01:25:49.744
How you doing, Gl Joe. Can I help you?

01:25:50.047 --> 01:25:51.537
What is my name?

01:25:56.187 --> 01:25:58.449
My last movie was nominated
for two Academy Awards.

01:25:58.489 --> 01:26:00.424
I would like to say that.

01:26:15.774 --> 01:26:19.801
Man, who'd have thought
a woman that fat could move so quick?

01:26:20.011 --> 01:26:21.842
Oh, my God, y'all!

01:26:26.585 --> 01:26:27.813
Sergeant!

01:26:27.919 --> 01:26:29.682
People of La Mirada…

01:26:31.456 --> 01:26:33.390
People of La Miranda!

01:26:33.625 --> 01:26:34.922
Tonight.

01:26:35.093 --> 01:26:36.822
The end of La Mirada!

01:26:37.095 --> 01:26:38.528
Shit!

01:26:48.807 --> 01:26:50.138
Git-r-done!

01:26:59.451 --> 01:27:02.545
Oye como va, bitches. I'm out.
