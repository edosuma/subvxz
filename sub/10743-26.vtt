we could remember where.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.147
Are you free for lunch?

09:10.683 --> 09:12.050
        In the cafeteria?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.852

09:13.854 --> 09:16.187
    Oh, I would like that.
        Fine.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.155
   Now, I'll pick you up here.
        Come along, major.

      the general waiting.

Uh, major.

            of that?

Uh, major.

            Very sorry, sir.

Well, look that over.
               Yes, sir.

     He seems very nervous.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.293
      I think he has a reason
      to be nervous, general.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.332

      a security clearance?

    your dinner.

     him that silly idea,

that you and I were--

21:33.692 --> 21:35.726
        Do you realize what this
              means to me?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.828
    This means that I'm gonna be
        the youngest general

21:37.830 --> 21:39.463
in the United States Air Force.
       Yes.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.166
   Mm. It's gonna be a pay hike,
           uh, uh, power,

21:42.168 --> 21:43.834
              uh, more prestige,
                  privilege--

21:43.836 --> 21:46.403
 Oh, I knew you would
  change your mind.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.906
    How soon can you arrange it?
 Oh, right away. Uh...

21:48.908 --> 21:50.040
    This afternoon?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.842
               Good, good, good.
               That's wonderful.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.677
                And now, uh...
             Now, wait a minute.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.179
              You better give me
               a couple of days.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.148
   Uh, I still have a few things
         to clear up first.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.783
      What?

21:58.785 --> 22:02.552
 Well, I just, uh-- I have a few
    things to clear up first.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.755
           Everything's all set.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.456
       Oh, good. I thought
      you'd never get here.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.558
        I thought you could take
        Eloise out to breakfast.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.660
             Uh-huh.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.228
         And you could take Edna
              out to lunch.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.462
             Yeah.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.564
     And you could just pick one
        of these beauties here

22:14.566 --> 22:16.167
                for dinner, huh.
               Any one of those.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.035
                     Ah, yeah.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.237
       Juanita. I'll take
       her out to dinner,

22:20.239 --> 22:21.972
         and we'll see
  which one of these will do.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.208
Ooh, wh-wh-which one
of these will do what?

22:24.210 --> 22:25.609
Who--? Who are they?

22:25.611 --> 22:27.577
     Oh, one of these girls
      is gonna be my wife.

22:27.579 --> 22:29.613
 Your wife?
               Isn't that great?

22:29.615 --> 22:31.782
       Tony told me you arranged
       to have him made general,

22:31.784 --> 22:34.285
 and, of course, everybody knows
   a general has to be married.

22:34.287 --> 22:36.420
              So I brought over
            a few pictures here

22:36.422 --> 22:38.255
      to view the eligible girls
               in town.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.191
Generals have
to be married?

22:40.193 --> 22:41.725
         Oh, yes. Yes.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.028
        Uh, that's one
        of the rules.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.029
                          Now...

22:46.432 --> 22:48.665
        What have I done?

22:51.737 --> 22:53.404
              Master?
About Juanita, I think...

22:53.406 --> 22:55.739
    You mean, in order to be
a general, you must have a wife?

22:55.741 --> 22:57.408
Oh, yeah. That's right.
          Oh!

23:01.381 --> 23:02.946
 You cannot marry
any of these girls.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.648
             Why not? They're
          really all quite nice.

23:04.650 --> 23:07.117
 Yes, you don't have to worry.
 I'm gonna pick out a good one.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.619
Well, I think I have
  made a mistake.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.787
              Huh?

23:09.789 --> 23:12.923
Uh, uh, y-y-you are much
too young to be a general.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.157
            I am?

23:14.159 --> 23:17.327
Would you be terribly upset
if you were not a general?

23:17.329 --> 23:18.362
       Well, I don't know.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.731
I kinda had my heart set on it,
            Jeannie.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.900
  But if-- If you don't think
    it's a good idea, then--

23:22.902 --> 23:24.869
Oh, it is
a terrible idea, master.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.370
        Yeah. All right,
         then I won't.

23:26.372 --> 23:27.738
Oh, thank you.
    Ha-ha!

23:27.740 --> 23:29.139
          You go home
      and fix some dinner,

23:29.141 --> 23:30.374
       and I'll be there
             later.

23:30.376 --> 23:31.876
Oh, no. Please let me
stay with you.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.544
          No, really.
  I'd rather you go home now.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.845
But I want to play secretary.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.346
          Now, really.
              Now.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.048
   Very well.

23:38.851 --> 23:39.850
         I did it.
         I did it.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.318
You did it? I did it.
   I was helping.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.986
  I was the one who
brought the pictures.

23:42.988 --> 23:44.288
             Oh, you were great.
                  Ha-ha-ha!

23:44.290 --> 23:45.989
            I told you, when she
             saw those pictures,

23:45.991 --> 23:47.024
                    she'd flip.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.759
            One picture is worth
              a thousand words.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.260
   Oh, you sure fooled her,
             boy.

23:51.997 --> 23:54.865
    Well, you're still
     the old master.
                        Yeah.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.199
                   Oh, God,
              I hated to do it--

23:56.201 --> 23:58.302
 We're looking for Miss Jeannie.
        Have you seen her?

23:58.304 --> 24:00.404
   Uh, Jean-- Miss Jeannie.
  Oh, no, you mean the girl

24:00.406 --> 24:02.205
  that was just here?
    No, she's gone.

24:02.207 --> 24:03.774
          When will she be back?
I don't think

24:03.776 --> 24:05.576
she's coming back.
     Uh, that's right.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.644
          Well, we'll find her.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.448
You're wearing sergeant stripes,
             major.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.650
Yeah, what are you doing
in these sergeant stripes?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.618
 Would you mind explaining that,
          Major Nelson?

24:14.620 --> 24:15.853
           Yes--
  Yeah.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.521
        Whose side
       are you on?

24:17.523 --> 24:19.189
  Uh, uh, uh, uh, sir, it--
        It actually--

24:19.191 --> 24:20.624
      Well, I have
    this girlfriend,

24:20.626 --> 24:23.093
  a-and she sometimes
    just doesn't...
