WEBVTT

00:09.140 --> 00:11.410
The Satanic Nebula!

00:11.460 --> 00:15.730
Or...the lagoon of lost stars...

00:15.780 --> 00:17.130
or we could go...

00:17.180 --> 00:18.730
to Brighton!

00:18.780 --> 00:20.530
I've got a whole day worked out.

00:20.580 --> 00:24.330
Sorry, but as you can see,
I've got plans.

00:24.380 --> 00:25.770
Have you?

00:25.820 --> 00:26.970
Look at me.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.740
Yeah, OK.

00:29.980 --> 00:32.369
No, no, no. No.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.050
Look at me.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.930
Yep, looking.

00:35.980 --> 00:37.970
Seriously?

00:38.020 --> 00:39.810
Why is your face all coloured in?

00:39.860 --> 00:42.010
7.15. Meeting me.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.660
You are.

00:45.060 --> 00:46.530
Date.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.970
Second one.

00:48.020 --> 00:49.650
Got the words out.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.780
Not in the right order, but, hey...
maths teacher!

00:54.620 --> 00:56.180
Out!

00:57.460 --> 00:59.010
Are you taller?

00:59.060 --> 01:01.250
Heels.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.450
What,
do you have to reach a high shelf?

01:03.500 --> 01:05.290
Right, got to go. Going to be late.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.530
~ For a shelf? ~ Bye!

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:16.940 --> 01:18.980
There you go,
you've got another playmate.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.130
Hardly anyone in the universe
has that number.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.810
Well, I'VE got it.

01:25.860 --> 01:27.770
Yes, from some woman in a shop.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.170
We STILL don't know who that was.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.620
Is that her now?

01:33.060 --> 01:36.010
There are very few
people that it could be.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.890
~ Don't. ~ Why not?

01:40.940 --> 01:43.570
~ Because, if you answer it,
something will happen. ~ What?

01:43.620 --> 01:46.890
~ A thing. ~ It's just a phone, Clara.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.420
Nothing happens
when you answer the phone.

01:54.020 --> 01:56.450
~ Doctor? ~ Don't touch it!
~ Where are we? How did we get here?

01:56.500 --> 02:00.300
Who are you? Sorry, what's going on?
I don't understand.

02:03.740 --> 02:06.010
~ What is that thing?
~ It's a memory worm.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.449
~ What happened to your face?
~ Deletes your memories.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.850
~ Did you see her face?
~ How did I get here?

02:10.900 --> 02:13.290
The same way we all did,
but we've all forgotten.

02:13.340 --> 02:14.770
And who are you?

02:14.820 --> 02:18.090
'I am the Doctor,
a Time Lord from Gallifrey.

02:18.140 --> 02:21.570
'I have agreed to this memory wipe
of my own free will.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.090
'I am Clara Oswald, human.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.970
'I have agreed to this memory wipe
of my own free will.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.810
'Do I really have to touch
that worm thing?

02:28.860 --> 02:30.690
'Yes, you do. And change your shoes.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.410
'You're next, Psi.

02:32.460 --> 02:35.130
'I am Psi - augmented human.

02:35.180 --> 02:39.380
'I have agreed to this...memory wipe
of my own free will.

02:42.700 --> 02:46.010
'I am Saibra - mutant human.

02:46.060 --> 02:50.090
'I have agreed to this memory
wipe of my own free will.'

03:34.420 --> 03:36.330
'This is a recorded message.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.850
'I am the Architect.

03:37.900 --> 03:42.970
'Your last memory is of receiving a
contact from an unknown agency - me.

03:43.020 --> 03:46.530
'Everything since has been erased
from your minds.

03:46.580 --> 03:49.650
'Now, pay close attention
to this briefing.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.410
'This is the Bank of Karabraxos -

03:52.460 --> 03:54.890
'the most secure bank
in the galaxy.

'A fortress for the super-rich.

'If you can afford your own star
system, this is where you keep it.

'All movement is monitored,

'DNA is authenticated at every stage.

'Your survival depends

04:41.100 --> 04:43.130
Open up and you shall be

There's another exit!

Ah. Augmented - nice.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.650
'The Bank of Karabraxos is
impregnable.'

04:57.700 --> 04:59.090
Please stand away from the door!

We do not wish to hurt you
before incineration.

'The Bank of Karabraxos has never
been breached.

05:04.620 --> 05:08.300
'You will rob
the Bank of Karabraxos.'

05:10.700 --> 05:11.820
Report.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.250
'Sorry, hello? Who is this?'

05:15.300 --> 05:18.210
This is Ms Delphox -
Head of Bank Security.

05:18.260 --> 05:20.890
I sent you to investigate
an off-world intruder.

05:20.940 --> 05:24.890
'Did you? I was wondering
what we're doing here.'

05:24.940 --> 05:27.210
We found these amazing worms...

05:37.580 --> 05:40.580
Unwelcome guests.
We're going to need the Teller.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.060
Are you hungry, boy?

05:55.580 --> 05:59.740
OK, OK, OK. Stop, stop, stop.
Far enough.

06:02.380 --> 06:05.130
Augmented human.
Computer-augmented, yes?

06:05.180 --> 06:08.890
~ Mainframe in your head? ~ I'm a gamer.
Sorry, who put YOU in charge?

06:08.940 --> 06:12.380
You're a liar.
That's a prison code on your neck.

06:13.820 --> 06:17.490
I'm a hacker...slash bank robber.

06:17.540 --> 06:20.170
Good. This is a good day
to be a bank robber.

06:20.220 --> 06:22.850
Mutant human. What kind of mutant?

06:22.900 --> 06:25.050
Like he says,
why are YOU in charge now?

06:25.100 --> 06:27.220
It's my special power -
what's yours?

06:41.660 --> 06:44.130
I touch living cells -
I can replicate the owner.

06:44.180 --> 06:47.210
~ Your face, when we first saw you...
~ I touched the worm.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.060
~ You can replicate their clothes too?
~ I wear a hologram shell.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.610
Human cells.
DNA from a customer, maybe?

06:54.660 --> 06:56.330
A disguise to get us in?

06:56.380 --> 06:59.170
We're actually going to do it?
Rob the bank?

06:59.220 --> 07:02.260
I don't think we have a choice -
we've already agreed to.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.850
How long can you maintain
the image for?

07:14.900 --> 07:16.460
For as long as I like.

07:42.780 --> 07:45.490
Question one - robbing banks is easy
if you've got a TARDIS.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.690
~ So why am I not using it?
~ Question two, where IS the TARDIS?

07:48.740 --> 07:51.930
OK, that probably should be
question one.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.130
'Banking floor locking down.'

07:56.180 --> 07:57.810
They know we're here.

07:57.860 --> 08:00.060
'Banking floor locking down.'

08:40.299 --> 08:41.730
What is that?

08:41.780 --> 08:45.220
I don't know. Hate not knowing.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.610
Excuse me, sir.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.570
I regret to say
that your guilt has been detected.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.010
What? That...
that's totally ridiculous.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.890
Is it, sir? Well, then,
we will certainly double-check.

08:58.940 --> 09:02.890
The Teller will now scan your
thoughts for any criminal intent.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.210
Good luck, sir.

09:06.260 --> 09:08.250
~ Interesting. ~ What is?

09:08.300 --> 09:10.170
The latest thing in sniffer dogs.

09:10.220 --> 09:14.650
Telepathic - it hunts guilt.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.890
What about OUR guilt?

09:15.940 --> 09:18.050
Currently being drowned out.

09:19.580 --> 09:20.770
What's he doing?

09:20.820 --> 09:23.770
If he has a plan,
he's trying NOT to think of it.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.810
Ever tried not thinking
about something?

09:25.860 --> 09:28.650
~ No. ~ You may have to.

09:31.180 --> 09:33.180
Ah, criminal intent detected.

09:34.780 --> 09:37.170
How naughty. What was your plan?

09:37.220 --> 09:39.730
Counterfeit currency
in your briefcase, perhaps?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.330
No, not at all, for God's sake.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.490
It doesn't really matter,

09:42.540 --> 09:44.130
we'll establish the details later.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.770
The Teller is never wrong

09:45.820 --> 09:47.380
when it comes to guilt.

09:48.660 --> 09:50.170
Your account will now be deleted,

09:50.220 --> 09:51.420
and obviously your mind.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.060
Suppertime!

10:08.900 --> 10:12.090
Wiping his mind -
turning his brain into soup.

10:12.140 --> 10:14.170
Your next of kin will be informed,

10:14.220 --> 10:15.690
and incarcerated,

10:15.740 --> 10:18.940
as further inducement
to honest financial transactions.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.050
We've got to help him.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.940
He's gone already, it's over.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.170
He's in agony, look at him.

10:30.220 --> 10:33.580
Those aren't tears, Clara.
That's soup.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.530
Account closed.

10:41.580 --> 10:44.780
Take him away.
He's ready for his close-up.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.770
Apologies for the disturbance.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.620
Everyone have a lovely day.

11:02.220 --> 11:05.370
'Deposit booth locking.
Please exhale.

11:05.420 --> 11:08.660
'Your valuables will be transported
up from the vault.'

11:12.500 --> 11:14.850
If he can break in here
and plant this thing,

11:14.900 --> 11:17.700
~ then why does he need our help?
~ Depends what the thing is.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.650
OK, well, I'm no expert,
but...fuses,

11:20.700 --> 11:23.180
timer, I'm going to stick my
neck out and say "bomb".

11:25.260 --> 11:27.860
Bank schematic...now.

11:42.100 --> 11:45.250
So, the man we captured on the
banking floor wasn't the target.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.410
Four visitors just entered
a safety-deposit box.

11:48.460 --> 11:50.770
The greatest bank in the galaxy.

11:50.820 --> 11:54.210
Our reputation must remain secure.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.820
The Director will blame us.
We'll be fired...

11:59.300 --> 12:00.660
..fired with pain.

12:04.260 --> 12:06.650
The floor below
is all service corridors -

12:06.700 --> 12:08.650
the veins and arteries of the bank.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.170
~ He wants us to blow through
the floor. ~ We'll die if we do that.

12:21.220 --> 12:23.450
Well, not necessarily -
there must be a plan.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.170
What if the plan is, we're blowing up
the floor for someone else?

12:26.220 --> 12:28.210
What if we're not supposed to make it
out alive?

12:28.260 --> 12:30.490
Oh, don't be so...pessimistic -

12:30.540 --> 12:33.330
~ it'll affect team morale.
~ What, and getting us blown up won't?

12:33.380 --> 12:34.690
Well, only very, very briefly.

12:34.740 --> 12:37.370
Er, no, no way! Do you what you
like. I'm going to take my chances

12:37.420 --> 12:40.490
~ out there. ~ Psi! ~ No, no, no,
this guy - your mate - is a lunatic!

12:40.540 --> 12:43.450
What do you want, Psi -
more than anything else?

12:43.500 --> 12:46.130
Whatever it is, it's in this bank.

12:46.180 --> 12:49.370
You agreed to rob the most
impregnable bank in history -

12:49.420 --> 12:51.530
you must have had
a very good reason.

12:51.580 --> 12:52.940
We all must have.

12:54.020 --> 12:57.890
Picture the thing you want most
in the universe -

12:57.940 --> 12:59.860
and decide how badly you want it.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.060
Well?

13:07.060 --> 13:09.010
Still don't understand
why you're in charge.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.890
Basically, it's the eyebrows.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.580
Nice.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.100
Dimensional shift bomb.

13:54.260 --> 13:56.660
Sends the particles
to a different plane.

13:58.980 --> 14:00.610
Come on, then -

14:00.660 --> 14:02.060
Team Not Dead!

14:04.500 --> 14:05.580
Open up!

14:16.740 --> 14:18.890
Well, so, what are we
supposed to do now?

14:18.940 --> 14:22.130
~ What's the plan? ~ I don't know.
The Architect set all this up,

14:22.180 --> 14:23.690
it should make sense.

14:23.740 --> 14:27.730
My personal plan is that a thing
will probably happen quite soon.

14:27.780 --> 14:31.050
~ So that's it. That's your plan? ~ Yep.
~ A thing will happen?

14:31.100 --> 14:32.580
A thing...probably.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.620
Hey, Psi!

14:40.220 --> 14:41.450
Doctor!

14:41.500 --> 14:43.930
There you go! Thing time!

14:43.980 --> 14:45.530
How does he get the cases here?

14:45.580 --> 14:48.810
By breaking into the bank in advance
of breaking into the bank.

14:48.860 --> 14:51.970
How did he do that? And if he CAN
do that, why does he need us?

14:52.020 --> 14:53.570
Not our problem.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.330
What IS our prob-prob-prob-prob...?

14:56.380 --> 14:58.250
~ You OK? ~ Drive glitch, it's fine.

14:58.300 --> 15:01.330
Guilt is our problem.
Guilt, in this bank, is fatal.

15:01.380 --> 15:02.530
The Teller can hear it.

15:02.580 --> 15:05.730
Ever since that first case was
opened, we've been targets.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.770
The more we know
about why we're here,

15:07.820 --> 15:09.330
the louder our guilt screams.

15:09.380 --> 15:12.290
That's why we wiped our memories -
for our own safety.

15:12.340 --> 15:16.290
Now, once I open this,
I can't close it again.

15:16.340 --> 15:19.050
Would it be safer
if only one of us learned it?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.770
I'm waiting for you to volunteer.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.970
~ Er, why me? ~ Because you didn't need
that memory worm, did you?

15:24.020 --> 15:26.690
You're half-computer,
you can perform a manual delete.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.970
You CAN clear your thoughts.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.540
OK.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.300
I don't know what it is.
You may as well have a look.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.460
Well, what are they?

15:50.100 --> 15:52.210
~ Not a clue. ~ Hmm, interesting.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.010
What is?

15:54.060 --> 15:57.330
~ You're lying. ~ Er, why would he be
lyi-lyi-lyi-lying?

15:57.380 --> 16:00.890
Ugh! Sorry. Stress.
Drains the batteries.

16:00.940 --> 16:03.450
~ Interface with this.
~ Do we have time for this?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.210
Why not?
There's no immediate threat.

16:05.260 --> 16:07.370
'Warning. Intruders detected.'

16:07.420 --> 16:09.010
I should stop saying things
like that.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.650
~ 'Intruders detected.'
~ Clara, stay with Psi. Saibra...

16:11.700 --> 16:13.100
let's go and investigate.

16:14.700 --> 16:15.690
'Intru...'

16:18.900 --> 16:19.940
Oh-h!

16:25.460 --> 16:27.250
Storm dust.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.890
You can delete your memories?

16:28.940 --> 16:30.570
Yeah, it's not as fun as it sounds.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.330
I've got a few I wish I could lose.

16:32.380 --> 16:34.210
And I've lost a few I wish I hadn't.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.860
No, I was...I was interrogated
in prison.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.580
And I guess I panicked.

16:41.580 --> 16:44.250
I didn't want to be a risk
to the people close to me, so...

16:44.300 --> 16:47.090
You deleted your friends?

16:47.140 --> 16:50.610
My friends, anyone
who ever helped me, my family.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.650
~ Your family? ~ Of course, my family.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.650
How could you do that?

16:54.700 --> 16:56.330
Well, I don't know.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.140
I suppose I must have loved them.

17:10.940 --> 17:12.609
Aren't you going to ask me?

17:12.660 --> 17:16.540
Why did you lie? Those things,
you know what they are.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.410
Exit strategy, of sorts.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.569
How did you know I was lying?

17:22.619 --> 17:25.329
I've had a lot of faces,
I find them easy to read.

17:25.380 --> 17:27.210
~ Quite a gift. ~ Gift?!

17:27.260 --> 17:31.580
~ Got us in here.
~ Mutant gene. No-one can touch me.

17:32.860 --> 17:34.540
If they do, I transform.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.940
Touch me, Doctor, and you'll be
looking at yourself.

17:39.060 --> 17:40.580
I am alone!

17:41.580 --> 17:43.370
~ Why? ~ Could you trust someone

17:43.420 --> 17:45.620
who looked back at you
out of your own eyes?

18:11.620 --> 18:13.370
Oh, my God.

18:13.420 --> 18:16.930
~ Why is he even still alive?
~ I don't know.

18:16.980 --> 18:18.610
But someone is watching.

18:18.660 --> 18:20.290
Doctor.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.980
However this goes,
whatever happens...

18:24.180 --> 18:25.650
..don't let me end up like that.

18:25.700 --> 18:29.490
'Intruders on the service level.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.450
'Intruders on the service level.'

18:31.500 --> 18:34.620
Now, this says, "Place to hide."

18:55.860 --> 18:57.460
Where are we?

19:09.700 --> 19:12.860
Nobody move. Nobody say a word.

19:14.660 --> 19:16.060
It's cocooned.

19:17.420 --> 19:18.860
Forced hibernation.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.250
Its power is probably dormant.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.890
Clara! It's locked on to you.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.690
It may still be asleep,
don't wake it. OK.

19:29.740 --> 19:31.050
How do I not do that?

19:31.100 --> 19:33.050
Keep your mind blank.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.460
Block everything.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.860
Once it locks onto your thoughts,
it won't let go.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.770
It's waking up.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.050
Keep blocking your thoughts, Clara.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.900
Don't think.

19:59.780 --> 20:00.940
This way!

20:04.860 --> 20:06.300
Oh!

20:10.220 --> 20:12.530
~ Saibra! ~ She's still in there.
How do we get her out?

20:12.580 --> 20:15.050
~ It's scanning her brain.
~ Then what?!

20:15.100 --> 20:17.300
~ Soup! ~ Then help her!

20:23.980 --> 20:25.490
Saibra!

20:25.540 --> 20:27.690
What should I do?
How can I get away?

20:27.740 --> 20:29.330
It's rooting through your brain.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.570
It's tasting
all the secrets stashed inside.

20:31.620 --> 20:34.490
Any moment now,
it will finish its sweep

20:34.540 --> 20:36.370
and start feasting on what's left.

20:36.420 --> 20:40.090
And then I become one of those
things we saw, sitting in a cage!

20:40.140 --> 20:41.570
~ Yes. ~ Can you not get me out?

20:41.620 --> 20:45.300
I'm sorry. I don't know how,
once it's locked onto your thoughts.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.850
Exit strategy.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.540
That means
what I think it means, right?

20:52.900 --> 20:55.020
~ Atomic shredder. ~ Painless?

20:56.340 --> 20:57.820
And instant.

21:02.700 --> 21:05.460
When you meet the Architect,
promise me something.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.330
Kill him.

21:08.380 --> 21:10.940
I hate him,
but I can't make that promise.

21:13.060 --> 21:17.740
A good man...
I left it late to meet one of those.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.730
Right, vault, that's clear.

21:44.780 --> 21:48.130
What's not clear is what we do now.

21:48.180 --> 21:51.490
~ You OK? ~ No, I'm an amnesiac robbing
a bank, why would I be OK?

21:51.540 --> 21:54.090
~ Because Saibra...
~ What? Saibra is dead, we are alive -

21:54.140 --> 21:56.010
prioritise
if you want to stay that way.

21:56.060 --> 21:58.850
Oh, is THAT why you call yourself
the Doctor -

21:58.900 --> 22:00.860
the professional detachment?

22:05.460 --> 22:08.490
Listen, when we're done here,
by all means,

22:08.540 --> 22:10.410
you go and find yourself
a shoulder to cry on.

22:10.460 --> 22:13.340
You'll probably need that.
Till then, what you need is me!

22:20.340 --> 22:23.090
Underneath it all,
he isn't really like that.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.010
It's very obvious that
you've been with him for a while.

22:26.060 --> 22:27.450
Why?

22:27.500 --> 22:29.930
Because you are really good
at the excuses.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.060
Another gift from the Architect.
Shall we unwrap it?

22:37.740 --> 22:39.660
The unbreakable bank.

22:40.740 --> 22:44.730
We must locate them. And
Director Karabraxos must not know.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.250
When people get fired here...

22:47.300 --> 22:49.020
it's messy.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.700
Release the Teller into the tunnels.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.890
Right, the system looks like it's
time-delayed.

23:16.940 --> 23:19.250
There are 24 lock
codes I need to break.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.690
Doctor...it's coming. We're trapped.

23:21.740 --> 23:24.060
~ Psi, how long? ~ As long as it takes.

23:25.860 --> 23:28.370
It's locked on
to one of our thought trails.

23:28.420 --> 23:31.090
We have to split up,
minimise the brain signals.

23:31.140 --> 23:34.060
What happened to your professional
detachment, Doctor?

23:39.020 --> 23:41.770
~ No, no!
~ In case it finds me. It's my choice.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.850
You don't use that, OK? Promise me.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.820
Time to run.

23:50.540 --> 23:51.900
Separate!

24:09.260 --> 24:11.060
'Vault box opening.

24:12.260 --> 24:13.940
'Vault box opening.

24:15.340 --> 24:20.090
'24, 23, 22, 21,

24:20.140 --> 24:25.780
'20, 19, 18, 17...'

24:49.500 --> 24:52.060
Keep your mind clear, Clara.

24:59.020 --> 25:00.860
Keep your mind blank.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.940
~ Aggh! ~ Clara!

25:39.340 --> 25:41.050
Come on!

25:41.100 --> 25:42.700
Come and find me.

25:44.580 --> 25:50.660
Every thief and villain in one
big cocktail. I am so guilty!

25:53.260 --> 25:57.170
Every famous burglar in history
is hiding in this bank right now

25:57.220 --> 25:58.820
in one body!

26:00.060 --> 26:01.620
Go and feast!

26:06.660 --> 26:08.890
Clara!

26:08.940 --> 26:12.570
For what it's worth -
and it might not be worth much -

26:12.620 --> 26:15.650
when your whole life flashes
in front of you,

26:15.700 --> 26:17.730
you see people you love...

26:17.780 --> 26:20.220
and people missing you...

26:27.660 --> 26:29.780
Well, I see no-one.

26:41.220 --> 26:44.100
'Three, two, one...

26:45.940 --> 26:49.300
'Failed. Vault unlocking. Failed.'

26:53.980 --> 26:55.900
It's not opening!

26:59.100 --> 27:00.780
Psi...

27:02.460 --> 27:04.140
..he died for nothing.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.410
Multiple locks.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.620
Last one still in place.

27:26.940 --> 27:29.450
Atomic seal. Unbreakable.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.090
Even for me.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.690
The Architect would know that.

27:32.740 --> 27:35.050
He wouldn't bring us all this way
for nothing.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.570
And get two people killed.

27:36.620 --> 27:37.610
Exactly.

27:37.660 --> 27:39.890
There must be some logic.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.420
Some logic?

27:42.740 --> 27:46.010
Come on, Architect!
What else have you got?

27:49.740 --> 27:51.770
Report, please.
What was the disturbance?

27:51.820 --> 27:53.450
Solar storm. Getting worse.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.020
Interfering with our systems.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.770
A storm...

28:08.060 --> 28:09.980
The storm's tripping the system.

28:12.980 --> 28:15.020
That's what he's got - a storm!

28:16.180 --> 28:18.420
How would he know
WHEN a storm would hit?

28:22.900 --> 28:24.330
Of course!

28:24.380 --> 28:26.530
Stupid, stupid Doctor.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.410
~ Of course, of course!
~ Of course, what?

28:28.460 --> 28:30.900
Whoever planned all this,
they're in the future.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.220
This isn't just a bank heist...

28:36.620 --> 28:38.060
..it's a time-travel heist.

28:39.940 --> 28:42.010
We've been sent back in time

28:42.060 --> 28:44.810
to the exact moment of the storm,

28:44.860 --> 28:47.370
to be in exactly the right place
when it hits,

28:47.420 --> 28:50.740
because that's the only time
the bank is vulnerable!

28:53.540 --> 28:55.100
'Vault unlocked.'

28:56.500 --> 28:58.460
The bank is now open!

29:00.420 --> 29:02.540
'Vault unlocked.'

29:11.420 --> 29:13.970
It explains why we're not hearing
the TARDIS.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.610
~ Sorry, what? ~ The solar disruption

29:15.660 --> 29:17.570
would have made navigation
impossible.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.810
The one time the bank is vulnerable
is the one time we can't just land.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.450
Doctor...the code!

29:22.500 --> 29:25.090
The code that was in the last case.
Look.

29:25.140 --> 29:28.140
~ Tech. ~ Technology.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.820
251. Find it.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.220
Tech.

30:04.540 --> 30:06.340
It's a neophyte circuit.

30:08.180 --> 30:10.530
I've only ever seen one once before.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.770
It can reboot any system.
Replace any lost data.

30:13.820 --> 30:14.980
Psi...

30:16.300 --> 30:18.170
..that's what he came for -
his reward.

30:18.220 --> 30:20.620
So what did Saibra come for?

30:27.420 --> 30:28.970
Gene suppressant.

30:29.020 --> 30:32.010
~ She wanted to be normal.
~ Everyone has a weakness.

30:32.060 --> 30:35.370
So the big question is this -
what did we come for?

30:35.420 --> 30:37.690
PV... Private vault.

30:37.740 --> 30:39.900
Karabraxos's own fortune?

30:44.060 --> 30:46.090
Intruders are most welcome.

30:46.140 --> 30:49.130
They remind us
that the bank is impregnable.

30:49.180 --> 30:53.250
It's good for morale to have a few
of you scattered about the place,

30:53.300 --> 30:55.620
preferably on view.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.540
Are you ready for YOUR close-up?

31:04.860 --> 31:06.650
If you're thinking
of ways to escape,

31:06.700 --> 31:09.210
the Teller will know
before you've even made a move.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.810
You'll never be bothered
by all that thinking again.

31:11.860 --> 31:13.370
Useful species.

31:13.420 --> 31:16.450
Last of its kind,
and we've signed an exclusive deal.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.260
Must be noisy inside its head.

31:19.260 --> 31:22.330
Painful
to listen to so much chatter,

31:22.380 --> 31:24.890
so many secrets...

31:24.940 --> 31:26.930
Must drive it wild.

31:26.980 --> 31:29.090
How can you force it to obey?

31:29.140 --> 31:32.130
Oh, everything has a price tag,
I think you'll find.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.210
The storm's getting worse.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.250
Customers are leaving.
Director Karabraxos will soon be...

31:38.300 --> 31:41.770
concerned.
Our jobs will be on the line.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.020
You're scared.

31:44.180 --> 31:46.090
Oh, I'm terrified.

31:46.140 --> 31:50.570
I have the disadvantage of knowing
Karabraxos personally.

31:50.620 --> 31:52.930
If you don't like your boss,
why stay?

31:52.980 --> 31:54.810
My face fits.

31:54.860 --> 31:59.260
Now...if you'll excuse me, I must
take the Teller to its hibernation.

32:00.260 --> 32:02.780
You two, dispose of our guests.

32:12.780 --> 32:14.650
Don't do this.
I'm having a very bad day,

32:14.700 --> 32:17.140
~ and I do not want
to be pushed around. ~ You're wrong.

32:18.180 --> 32:19.610
Wrong?

32:19.660 --> 32:21.570
It's not that bad a day.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.530
And you're being very slow.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.500
Why are you undoing my handcuffs?

32:26.940 --> 32:28.930
Saibra?

32:28.980 --> 32:31.060
It LOOKED like death.

32:32.540 --> 32:34.650
~ It was actually a teleporter.
~ Oh, my God!

32:34.700 --> 32:37.410
Good, eh? You think we're dead,
so the Teller thinks we're dead,

32:37.460 --> 32:39.570
and we play the creature
at his own mind games.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.490
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

32:42.540 --> 32:44.450
What? Sorry, sorry, what?

32:44.500 --> 32:47.970
You, you, you're...you're alive?

32:48.020 --> 32:50.890
Yeah, we're alive.
Look at us, we're all alive.

32:50.940 --> 32:52.890
No, no, no, no. Not dead.

32:52.940 --> 32:55.610
~ Alive.
~ There's an escape ship in orbit.

32:55.660 --> 32:57.170
Takes you right there.

32:57.220 --> 33:00.610
Oh, and there's this big blue box -
is that yours?

33:00.660 --> 33:02.690
Well, this is good...

33:02.740 --> 33:04.100
I suppose...

33:05.820 --> 33:08.140
You'll be able to resume
the mission.

33:09.300 --> 33:12.300
Gene suppressant -
antidote for your condition.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.770
Memory giver.

33:19.820 --> 33:21.740
All your yesterdays.

33:24.980 --> 33:27.730
There you go.
Job done, paid in full.

33:27.780 --> 33:30.090
~ Clever old Architect. ~ Very clever.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.650
~ I still hate him. ~ Me too.

33:31.700 --> 33:33.330
~ How were you paid? ~ I don't know.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.570
There's something
in the private vault.

33:35.620 --> 33:36.970
~ What's that? ~ Supply line.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.530
It's the only oxygen down
to the private vault.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.250
There's another one for water

33:41.300 --> 33:44.260
~ for basic life support.
~ What, for a private vault?

33:45.820 --> 33:48.620
Someone likes to hang out
with their wealth.

33:53.500 --> 33:57.580
MUSIC PLAYS: Overture
To The Abduction From The Seraglio

34:30.300 --> 34:31.690
Director Karabraxos?

34:31.739 --> 34:33.929
Excuse us,
but we've come to rob you.

34:33.980 --> 34:36.580
So if you want to put your hands
above your head, or...

34:41.820 --> 34:42.900
Or?

34:45.100 --> 34:46.860
You didn't bring any weapons.

34:48.739 --> 34:50.570
That's a bit of an oversight.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.530
Security, Karabraxos here.

34:52.580 --> 34:56.130
~ You're Karabraxos? ~ One moment.
~ Director Karabraxos,

34:56.179 --> 34:57.650
is there a problem?

34:57.700 --> 34:59.810
Intruders in the private vault.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.730
Send me the Teller.

35:01.780 --> 35:03.690
I want to find out how they got in,

35:03.740 --> 35:06.050
and then I want to wipe
their memories.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.730
She's a clone.

35:07.780 --> 35:09.850
It's the only way to control
my own security.

35:09.900 --> 35:12.090
I have a clone in every facility.

35:12.140 --> 35:14.690
~ Get on it right away.
~ Yes, of course.

35:14.740 --> 35:18.250
And then hand in your credentials.
You're fired, with immediate effect.

35:18.300 --> 35:20.330
But, please,
I've been in your service...

35:20.380 --> 35:23.130
Ever since the last one let me down
and I was forced to kill it.

35:23.180 --> 35:26.570
I can't quite believe that you're
putting me through this again.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.410
My clone.
And yet she doesn't even protest.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.370
Pale imitation, really.

35:31.420 --> 35:34.050
- I should sue!
- You're killing her?

35:34.100 --> 35:36.010
- You just said...
- Fired?

35:36.060 --> 35:39.770
I put all of the used clones
into the incinerator.

35:39.820 --> 35:42.810
Can't have to many of moi
scattered around.

35:42.860 --> 35:45.290
Sorry, you don't get on
with your own clone?

35:45.340 --> 35:47.970
She hates her own clones,

35:48.020 --> 35:50.890
she burns her own clones.

35:50.940 --> 35:54.020
Frankly, you're a career break
for the right therapist.

35:58.660 --> 36:02.530
Shut up.
Everybody, just...just shut up!

36:02.580 --> 36:05.050
And what is this display now,
as amusing as you are?

36:05.100 --> 36:08.620
Shut up! Just shut up, shut up,
shut up, shutetty up up up!

36:11.060 --> 36:13.900
What...what did you say?

36:15.900 --> 36:18.210
What did...you say?

36:18.260 --> 36:21.090
What did you say...
about your own eyes?

36:21.140 --> 36:23.090
De-shut up, say it again.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.250
How can you trust someone

36:24.300 --> 36:26.300
if they look back at you
out of your own eyes?

36:27.380 --> 36:29.690
I know one thing
about the Architect.

36:29.740 --> 36:31.090
What is it that I know?

36:31.140 --> 36:33.690
I know one thing, something
I've known from the very start.

36:33.740 --> 36:35.980
~ What? ~ I hate him.

36:37.220 --> 36:40.490
He's overbearing, he's manipulative,

36:40.540 --> 36:45.290
he likes to think
that he's very clever. I HATE him.

36:45.340 --> 36:47.300
Clara, don't you see?

36:49.380 --> 36:51.130
I hate the Architect!

36:51.180 --> 36:53.890
What in the name of sanity
is going in this room now?

36:53.940 --> 36:57.250
We're getting sanity judgment
from the self-burner.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.450
Do you mind
if I borrow a little bit of paper?

37:00.500 --> 37:02.690
And what are you doing now?

37:02.740 --> 37:05.450
I'm giving you...

37:05.500 --> 37:07.050
my telephone number.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.890
Why?

37:08.940 --> 37:10.330
Well,

37:10.380 --> 37:13.820
I thought you might like to call me
someday.

37:14.820 --> 37:17.610
Sorry, I thought
we were getting along famously -

37:17.660 --> 37:20.490
am I, like, misreading the signals
or something?

37:20.540 --> 37:23.330
Oh, that was a big one,
wasn't it?

37:23.380 --> 37:26.690
I think that your bank is about
to close for good, Karabraxos.

37:26.740 --> 37:28.170
If I was you, I'd get going.

37:28.220 --> 37:30.730
Don't mind us,
we'll just stay here and burn.

37:39.060 --> 37:40.970
Hard to know what to take.

37:41.020 --> 37:43.810
The greatest treasures of the
universe in just one suitcase.

37:47.860 --> 37:49.570
Doctor, what's the plan?
IS there a plan?

37:49.620 --> 37:52.650
~ We can use the shredders, get back
to the ship. ~ They're not shredders,

37:52.700 --> 37:55.290
they're teleports, and that's not
the most interesting thing

37:55.340 --> 37:57.540
~ about them. ~ So what is?
~ There were six of them. ~ Hey.

37:59.980 --> 38:01.250
Give me a call me some time.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.690
'Doors opening.'

38:02.740 --> 38:04.010
You'll be dead.

38:04.060 --> 38:06.370
Yeah, you'll be old -
we'll get on famously.

38:06.420 --> 38:11.100
You'll be old and full of regret for
the things that you can't change.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.180
'Doors closing.'

38:21.420 --> 38:24.650
~ Doctor, what the hell is going on?
~ Are you remembering?

38:24.700 --> 38:26.530
No, not a thing.

38:26.580 --> 38:30.410
~ But I'm understanding. ~ What is it?
What are you understanding?

38:30.460 --> 38:32.010
I'm not sure yet.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.370
I need my memory back.

38:34.420 --> 38:36.530
And I think there is only one way
to do that...

38:36.580 --> 38:37.890
Which would be?

38:37.940 --> 38:40.700
~ Soup. ~ Soup?

38:46.340 --> 38:47.620
Hello, big man.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.170
~ Peckish? ~ Doctor!

38:52.220 --> 38:55.420
No...no, let it take me.

38:56.660 --> 38:59.050
Let it read me. It's the only way!

38:59.100 --> 39:02.090
~ It will kill you! ~ What
have I told you about pessimism?

39:02.140 --> 39:05.690
Right, that's it...

39:05.740 --> 39:09.050
There are so many memories in here.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.690
Feast on them.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.570
Tuck in.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.980
Big scarf, bow tie,
bit embarrassing.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.770
What do you think of the new look?

39:18.820 --> 39:20.290
I was hoping for minimalism,

39:20.340 --> 39:22.180
but I think I came up
with magician!

39:25.340 --> 39:28.530
In the last few days,
there's been a block.

39:28.580 --> 39:31.530
Can you see the block?

39:31.580 --> 39:34.570
Tell me why I'm here!

39:34.620 --> 39:36.900
Show me why I'm here!

39:39.220 --> 39:41.770
Show me!

39:41.820 --> 39:43.930
It's just a phone, Clara.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.450
Nothing happens
when you answer the phone.

39:46.500 --> 39:47.690
Doctor?

39:47.740 --> 39:48.690
Hello?

39:48.740 --> 39:53.010
'You gave me this number.
My name is Madame Karabraxos.'

39:53.060 --> 39:59.250
I was once...the wealthiest person
in the Universe.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.090
'I need your assistance.'

40:01.140 --> 40:03.090
I'm dying.

40:03.140 --> 40:05.410
'With many, many regrets...'

40:05.460 --> 40:07.780
but one...perhaps...

40:09.500 --> 40:12.460
..you may be able to help me with.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.410
It's a little detour.

40:15.460 --> 40:17.650
It's a job, I've got to do it
for someone. Come on.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.890
~ We need to rob a bank. ~ What?

40:19.940 --> 40:22.300
Clara, I need worms.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.940
The Bank of Karabraxos
has never been breached.

40:38.980 --> 40:40.170
Architect.

40:40.220 --> 40:42.010
'Architect.'

40:42.060 --> 40:43.330
Architect.

40:43.380 --> 40:44.730
'Architect.'

40:44.780 --> 40:45.770
Architect.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.340
'Architect.'

40:54.420 --> 40:58.380
You will rob the Bank of Karabraxos.

41:00.900 --> 41:02.580
Did you see...

41:04.020 --> 41:06.250
..why we came?

41:06.300 --> 41:07.930
Why we're here?

41:07.980 --> 41:10.930
We had to delete our own memories,
otherwise you'd have known,

41:10.980 --> 41:14.530
and then she'd have known.
Because you're mentally linked.

41:14.580 --> 41:17.210
But she's gone now.
They've ALL gone.

41:17.260 --> 41:19.130
They have no power over you now.

41:19.180 --> 41:21.730
You can do exactly
what you want to do now.

41:21.780 --> 41:24.140
Exactly
what you've always wanted to do.

41:33.620 --> 41:35.050
It knows the combination!

41:35.100 --> 41:37.370
Of course it does,
it was linked to Karabraxos.

41:37.420 --> 41:40.290
What exactly are we doing here?
That thing killed people.

41:40.340 --> 41:42.860
So might you do,
to protect everything you loved.

41:50.420 --> 41:52.530
There she is.

41:52.580 --> 41:54.050
Not the last of its species.

41:54.100 --> 41:56.180
The last TWO.

42:01.940 --> 42:05.300
It's OK, it's OK. It's all right.

42:07.100 --> 42:10.570
Exit strategy.
We've got six shredders.

42:10.620 --> 42:12.170
Exactly!

42:12.220 --> 42:15.730
This wasn't a bank heist -
it never was.

42:15.780 --> 42:19.610
It was rescue mission,
for a whole species.

42:19.660 --> 42:22.850
Flesh and blood - the last currency.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.330
Time to go home.

42:26.380 --> 42:28.210
What do you think of that, big man?

42:35.940 --> 42:38.650
So much mental traffic
in the universe.

42:38.700 --> 42:41.620
Solitude is the only peace.

42:53.900 --> 42:57.210
Gioffre Borgia -
mucho scary hombre - says to me,

42:57.260 --> 42:59.890
"What do you think
of our Leaning Tower of Pisa?"

42:59.940 --> 43:01.940
I say, "It looks OK to me!"

43:07.820 --> 43:10.700
If you ever need help
with another bank heist...

43:16.140 --> 43:17.980
Yeah, it's not really his area.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.490
See? I don't have your face now!

43:30.540 --> 43:33.180
~ Yeah. I kind of miss that.
~ Oh, shut up!

43:40.500 --> 43:43.210
7.12, local time, as promised.

43:43.260 --> 43:46.170
~ Go and enjoy yourself. Don't do
anything I wouldn't do. ~ It's a date!

43:46.220 --> 43:49.930
I've just realised.
I'm going out for another meal now!

43:49.980 --> 43:54.130
Don't worry. Calories consumed on
the TARDIS have no lasting effect.

43:54.180 --> 43:55.770
What? Are you kidding?!

43:55.820 --> 43:58.610
Of course I'm kidding. It's a time
machine, not a miracle-worker!

43:58.660 --> 44:01.540
~ Bye! ~ See you. Don't rob any banks.
~ "Don't rob any banks" what?

44:03.540 --> 44:04.850
Without me.

44:04.900 --> 44:06.660
Course not, boss.

44:12.740 --> 44:15.330
Robbing a bank!
Robbing a whole bank!

44:15.380 --> 44:17.380
Beat that for a date!

44:24.100 --> 44:25.370
Are you OK?

44:25.420 --> 44:27.250
Yeah, course I'm OK.
Why wouldn't I be OK?

44:27.300 --> 44:30.010
~ I don't know. Every time I see you,
it's like you're... ~ What?

44:30.060 --> 44:31.970
In a rush. In a state.

44:32.020 --> 44:34.010
How's you? Sorry I'm late!

44:34.060 --> 44:35.810
Who are you having dinner with?

44:35.860 --> 44:38.490
I can't keep doing this.
I can't do it.

44:38.540 --> 44:42.250
The next few days are all about you.
I promise.

44:42.300 --> 44:45.330
I'm the new caretaker. John Smith.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.050
Welcome to Cole Hill, Mr Smith.

44:47.100 --> 44:48.570
Thanks.

44:48.620 --> 44:51.380
Problem. Solution. Destroy.
