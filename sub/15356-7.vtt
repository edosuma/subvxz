WEBVTT

00:50.759 --> 00:52.709
1926.

00:52.749 --> 00:55.599
5? 6?

00:55.899 --> 00:57.080
Ah, you idiot...

00:57.081 --> 00:59.737
It's been only a few minutes,
how can you forget?

01:11.719 --> 01:12.949
<i>Yes?</i>

01:43.039 --> 01:44.722
Hi, Miss Kim...

01:44.723 --> 01:47.524
This is the document
that Mr. Seo is looking for.

01:48.669 --> 01:50.339
Thank you.

01:50.979 --> 01:55.159
Hey, Kim Na Na! Hey, Kim Na Na!

01:55.329 --> 01:58.218
I heard Na Na is a bodyguard
for Seo Yong Hak.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.718
Is she here for that?

01:59.719 --> 02:01.708
The one-year birthday party...

02:01.709 --> 02:04.018
What are you doing here?

02:04.019 --> 02:06.299
As you can see.

02:06.979 --> 02:11.328
Yoon Sung, I'm really sorry
and thankful about today.

02:11.329 --> 02:13.559
Wait just a bit.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.009
[Jerk]

03:00.729 --> 03:03.198
Did you drink?
With Lee Yoon Sung?

03:03.229 --> 03:03.929
Yeah.

03:03.949 --> 03:05.201
Didn't you know I was waiting?

03:05.202 --> 03:09.401
You're the one who treats me
like I'm invisible.

03:09.469 --> 03:10.669
Sae Hee.

03:14.289 --> 03:15.929
Pick it up.

03:18.259 --> 03:18.959
What?

03:18.979 --> 03:20.676
<i>On the list of people returning to Korea,</i>

03:20.677 --> 03:21.917
<i>we found someone
who matches the suspect's description.</i>

03:21.919 --> 03:22.859
Really?

03:22.879 --> 03:24.538
Okay, I'll...

03:24.739 --> 03:26.278
You can go.

03:26.479 --> 03:30.169
Don't mind me.
I don't like it when you do.

03:31.319 --> 03:34.149
I'll go there right now.

03:34.229 --> 03:36.778
Do the work that you love so much.

03:36.779 --> 03:41.369
I'm going to take this to the dry cleaners,
go to the party, and take a taxi home.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.159
You found him?

03:50.209 --> 03:51.318
It's this person.

03:51.319 --> 03:54.278
His profile matches
the profile of the sniper.

03:54.279 --> 03:56.608
His name is Steve Lee,
and he's a Korean-American from the States.

03:56.609 --> 04:01.208
He owns a deer antler company with
connections to Asia, and he has no family.

04:01.209 --> 04:02.258
Where does he live?

04:02.259 --> 04:04.079
I'll look.

04:05.929 --> 04:08.169
Please pick up.

04:21.728 --> 04:25.379
That's more like it.
You have to be the one to call.

04:29.359 --> 04:30.569
Yes, Father.

04:32.399 --> 04:35.629
You're not home very often these days.

04:36.449 --> 04:38.818
He called the house earlier
and asked to get you on the line!

04:38.819 --> 04:41.218
Is it because of a girl?

04:41.219 --> 04:45.848
- No, it's not that...
- I told you not to fall in love.

04:45.849 --> 04:48.218
The moment you fall in love,

04:48.219 --> 04:50.088
our plan will fall through.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.018
It's not because of a girl.

04:52.019 --> 04:55.378
The Blue House is busy right now because
of a recent unknown hard drive attack.

04:55.379 --> 05:01.369
I sent you to the Blue House because
of the information that we can get there.

05:03.389 --> 05:05.589
What about Seo Yong Hak?

05:06.319 --> 05:08.308
I heard Hudson came in.

05:08.309 --> 05:11.548
He knows everything!
I had to tell him everything.

05:12.249 --> 05:17.368
On top of that, I heard
he got a very important document.

05:17.369 --> 05:19.189
He took it.

05:20.519 --> 05:22.338
Leak everything out now.

05:22.339 --> 05:27.608
So he can't get anywhere near the election,
and all the citizens know he's trash.

05:27.609 --> 05:30.348
- It's not time yet.
- Why the he** are you holding back for?

05:30.349 --> 05:31.548
What is your reason?!

05:31.549 --> 05:35.618
It's not enough for me
if he just drops out of the race.

05:35.619 --> 05:40.068
I have to show him that everyone
is equal in the eyes of the law.

05:40.069 --> 05:41.489
Equality?

05:47.339 --> 05:49.858
Why is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo here?

05:49.859 --> 05:51.499
Prosecutor?

06:07.169 --> 06:08.819
Why is he here?

06:11.959 --> 06:15.558
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo from Seoul
Prosecutor's Office, Special Investigations.

06:15.559 --> 06:17.169
I'm Steve Lee.

06:21.149 --> 06:22.178
Please sit.

06:22.179 --> 06:23.449
Thank you.

06:32.069 --> 06:33.309
Aigoo.

06:33.979 --> 06:36.098
This is a child's toy.

06:36.099 --> 06:38.068
You don't have any children
according to what I know.

06:38.069 --> 06:42.288
Oh, maybe the maid dropped it here.

06:42.289 --> 06:43.958
I'm not sure...

06:44.559 --> 06:49.188
But why is the Public Prosecutor's Office
looking for me?

06:49.189 --> 06:50.409
Oh, yes.

06:50.729 --> 06:54.321
Ah, I'll get you guys something to drink.

07:17.369 --> 07:18.589
Have this.

07:18.609 --> 07:19.949
Thank you.

07:20.859 --> 07:23.938
I heard you work
in the deer antler business.

07:23.939 --> 07:26.218
It must be difficult.

07:26.219 --> 07:29.058
Not at all, I don't have
to raise them, the trainers do.

07:29.059 --> 07:34.348
I just get them from the US
and sell them in Korea.

07:34.349 --> 07:36.748
Does this have anything
to do with the deer antler business?

07:36.749 --> 07:38.739
No, it does not.

07:40.839 --> 07:45.358
Your house is very unique,
with the piano and all.

07:45.359 --> 07:46.818
You must have a lot of hobbies.

07:46.819 --> 07:49.318
I like to play the piano and sing,

07:49.319 --> 07:52.148
and even though my leg is no good
as you can see,

07:52.149 --> 07:56.278
I like to ride my motorcycle once in a while
for fresh air.

07:56.279 --> 07:58.168
Impressive.

07:58.169 --> 08:00.948
Then do you like shooting as well?

08:00.949 --> 08:02.369
Shooting?

08:07.809 --> 08:12.048
I've never shot before. I don't like
that type of frightening things.

08:12.049 --> 08:15.618
I don't even go out on the days
the deer antlers are cut off.

08:15.619 --> 08:17.738
To tell you the truth,
we discovered that the sniper

08:17.739 --> 08:20.078
who attempted to murder
Candidate Seo Yong Hak has a leg problem.

08:20.079 --> 08:24.378
The gun was also very special
so we thought the person was a foreigner.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.928
I know this is an inconvenience
but we've come here for that.

08:26.929 --> 08:30.828
Oh, yes, I see.

08:30.829 --> 08:36.227
I'll order a fingerprint comparison
for the elevator fingerprints and these.

08:36.229 --> 08:40.618
He said he has never shot a gun before,
but his hands say something different.

08:40.619 --> 08:45.308
He has a mark in the area
between his thumb and his index finger.

08:45.309 --> 08:49.169
Find out if his alibi is legitimate
and investigate some more.

08:59.959 --> 09:02.601
If he came all the way here to investigate,

09:02.602 --> 09:05.772
that means he's not a prosecutor
to laugh off.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.238
I don't feel good about this.

09:08.239 --> 09:12.895
Be cautious with all your movements
from now on.

09:19.919 --> 09:22.269
Totally unlucky jerk.

09:22.489 --> 09:24.138
Why does it have to be Sae Hee unni
of all people?

09:24.139 --> 09:28.348
How did he know that Sae Hee unni
likes tall guys?

09:28.349 --> 09:29.619
Na Na.

09:30.769 --> 09:32.549
Take this.

09:32.569 --> 09:36.208
Aigoo, work must be really hard.
You look so worn out!

09:36.209 --> 09:39.678
No, you don't have to give me anything.
You worked so hard to make this.

09:39.679 --> 09:43.168
I can't eat that much by myself anyway.

09:43.169 --> 09:45.078
It's still better than working odd jobs,
right?

09:45.079 --> 09:46.299
Yes.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.548
I don't have puffy eyes in the morning
lately either.

09:48.549 --> 09:50.028
Maybe it's because
I don't cry before I go to sleep now.

09:50.029 --> 09:54.348
Only good things will happen to you
from now on, since you're a good person.

09:54.349 --> 09:55.699
Here, eat.

09:55.919 --> 09:57.299
Thank you.

10:08.599 --> 10:11.983
Ahjumma's food is always good.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.768
I'm just telling you because
your imagination seems to be running wild.

10:21.769 --> 10:23.718
I don't care.
It's none of my business.

10:23.719 --> 10:26.798
Why aren't you picking up my calls
if it has nothing to do with you?

10:26.799 --> 10:28.529
Just stop.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.989
Hey, Kim Na Na.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.098
Did you just hold my hand?
Let go.

10:36.099 --> 10:38.358
Are you jealous?

10:38.559 --> 10:41.678
You're being curt with me right now,
and you didn't pick up my calls.

10:41.679 --> 10:44.788
- W... Why would I? I was just shocked.
- Shocked?

10:44.789 --> 10:46.288
You know I'm this kind of guy.

10:46.289 --> 10:48.388
Don't go jumping to random conclusions.

10:48.389 --> 10:50.588
Where are you going?
Let's talk.

10:50.589 --> 10:54.338
Hey, Jerk, did you just grab my shoulder?

10:54.339 --> 10:56.098
Yeah, I grabbed your shoulder.
So what?

10:56.099 --> 10:58.048
You grabbed my hand before, too, right?

10:58.049 --> 10:59.158
Then how much is that?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.148
50,000 won for the hand,
100,000 won for the shoulder.

11:01.149 --> 11:04.018
Give me 150,000 won now.

11:04.019 --> 11:06.118
Hey, is everything money to you?

11:06.119 --> 11:07.638
Hurry up and give me the money.

11:07.639 --> 11:10.148
You have to stick to the contract.

11:10.149 --> 11:12.758
Okay.
I'll give it to you.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.068
How much? Hand.

11:15.069 --> 11:19.338
Both shoulders.
What, 250,000 won?

11:19.339 --> 11:20.788
What's wrong with you?

11:20.789 --> 11:23.918
Stop making living with you
so uncomfortable.

11:23.919 --> 11:28.659
- Spill everything out.
- You're such a jerk.

11:28.819 --> 11:32.639
- Hey, take the money!
- I don't want it!

11:35.609 --> 11:39.468
<i>Today at the hotel,
Sae Hee spilled alcohol on my clothes,</i>

11:39.469 --> 11:43.159
<i>so she wanted to take it
to the dry cleaners. That's what happened.</i>

11:43.489 --> 11:44.908
She spilled alcohol?

11:44.909 --> 11:49.839
I don't want to be misunderstood,
so I'm just telling you.

11:51.069 --> 11:54.319
I didn't know that...

12:14.889 --> 12:20.169
Kim Na Na, why do you care
about that kind of stuff?

12:26.800 --> 12:28.958
Why did she have to show up right then?

12:28.959 --> 12:34.339
Forget it.
Just work.

12:37.129 --> 12:42.329
Seo Dong Jin, Seo Dong Seok. Seo Dong Eun.

12:43.719 --> 12:46.069
Were they really sick?

12:49.259 --> 12:50.908
You were watching porn, huh?

12:50.909 --> 12:52.238
What are you getting scared for?

12:52.239 --> 12:55.898
Hey, don't you have to knock
and give me a few seconds?

12:55.899 --> 12:59.198
Well, it would be weird
if a playboy like you didn't watch porn.

12:59.199 --> 13:01.258
Let's eat.
Stop watching.

13:01.259 --> 13:03.118
I'm not eating.
You eat.

13:03.119 --> 13:08.829
If you don't knock next time, you're dead!
Huh?!

13:09.669 --> 13:11.558
I thought you said you're not eating.

13:11.559 --> 13:14.419
There are so many dishes to eat.

13:15.459 --> 13:16.929
So hot!

13:18.109 --> 13:21.399
Madis ahjumma gave it to me.

13:22.029 --> 13:23.338
The Madis ahjumma?

13:23.339 --> 13:27.108
Yeah. She gives it to me sometimes,
like a mom.

13:27.109 --> 13:31.419
Eat quickly
so I can give her back her containers.

13:32.419 --> 13:36.148
I want to have some fresh air too...

13:36.149 --> 13:37.400
Should I go too?

13:41.199 --> 13:44.648
Ajumeoni, you're closing already?

13:44.649 --> 13:50.569
Yeah, I want to rest.
I'm not feeling too good.

13:51.499 --> 13:54.520
Oh, it's the PhD from last time.

13:55.721 --> 13:56.921
Hello.

13:58.479 --> 13:59.898
Here are your containers.

13:59.899 --> 14:03.018
I put some peanuts in there
for you to eat when you're bored.

14:03.019 --> 14:05.698
You didn't have to bring it back so quickly.

14:05.699 --> 14:08.328
I'll eat the peanuts well.
Bye.

14:08.329 --> 14:10.466
Go home carefully.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.858
Are you okay?

14:17.969 --> 14:19.359
Oh, yes...

14:19.689 --> 14:22.108
Are you okay, Ajumeoni?

14:22.109 --> 14:24.138
It's not good if you keep being sick.

14:24.139 --> 14:26.858
Do you want to go to the hospital?

14:26.859 --> 14:28.892
No, it's okay.

14:29.579 --> 14:32.358
I'll just take medicine and rest
when I get home. I'll be okay.

14:32.359 --> 14:35.871
Don't worry.
Go.

14:40.839 --> 14:44.548
Lee Yoon Sung, carry her on your back.

14:44.549 --> 14:45.969
Hurry up.

14:47.999 --> 14:49.440
Get on my back.

14:50.309 --> 14:52.968
Give this to me and get on.

14:52.969 --> 14:54.438
No, it's okay.

14:54.439 --> 14:57.619
You should just get on his back.

15:50.729 --> 15:53.084
Are you okay now?

15:54.449 --> 15:58.518
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

15:58.519 --> 16:00.944
It must have been hard on you.

16:02.979 --> 16:08.639
Your mother must be proud
to have a strong son like you.

16:11.989 --> 16:14.041
I don't have a mother.

16:17.689 --> 16:19.898
I don't even know her face.

16:23.729 --> 16:25.610
Is that so?

16:27.909 --> 16:33.848
If she was alive,
she would have been proud.

16:34.049 --> 16:39.369
You're handsome, tall, and have a PhD.

16:41.339 --> 16:43.069
Hold on.

16:44.379 --> 16:49.119
Drink this as you go.

16:49.639 --> 16:55.548
It gives me strength while I work.
It's really good.

16:55.749 --> 16:59.298
It's okay.
You should have it.

16:59.299 --> 17:03.238
Thank you.
Now then...

17:03.239 --> 17:04.919
Thank you.

17:38.799 --> 17:40.389
Drink it.

17:42.459 --> 17:43.929
I'm full.

17:46.159 --> 17:49.978
You've been weird since you saw Ajumeoni.

17:49.979 --> 17:52.068
What's wrong?

17:52.569 --> 17:56.369
Go first.
I'll head back later.

18:28.589 --> 18:30.818
I told you to go.

18:31.519 --> 18:35.848
I guess a playboy thinks of his mom
sometimes too.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.709
Go. Hurry.

18:37.819 --> 18:38.658
How interesting.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.638
Sometimes, I think of my mom
when I see Ahjumma too.

18:42.639 --> 18:46.918
So sometimes when I think about my mom,
I go there.

18:46.919 --> 18:51.409
She makes things that aren't on the menu.

18:51.869 --> 18:57.719
And then I come here
and sing songs my mom taught me.

19:14.739 --> 19:19.358
Did our big baby have a hard day today?

19:19.359 --> 19:21.458
What are you doing?

19:21.459 --> 19:23.628
You laughed.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.529
Go now.

19:25.889 --> 19:27.109
No.

19:30.219 --> 19:32.078
I'm not going to move.

19:32.079 --> 19:33.329
Go.

19:45.979 --> 19:48.149
It's been a while.

20:05.149 --> 20:08.658
My child! My child!
Where is my child?!

20:08.659 --> 20:09.988
You should have just killed me
when you took him!

20:09.989 --> 20:13.698
How could you take my child from me?
How could you?

20:13.699 --> 20:19.648
What have you done with child?
My child! My child!

20:19.949 --> 20:23.208
What have you done with my child?!
My child!

20:25.116 --> 20:26.610
My child!

20:36.209 --> 20:42.168
Do you know how I lived
for the past 28 years?

20:42.369 --> 20:47.259
Why are you living like this?
What about the money?

20:49.009 --> 20:54.218
Was it you?
The person who sent the money?

20:54.219 --> 21:00.209
I didn't spend a penny of it
so take it and give me back my child.

21:00.919 --> 21:03.338
The child is living well.

21:03.339 --> 21:08.888
He studied in the States
and his job is very nice.

21:08.889 --> 21:13.448
I can't believe any of it.
Bring him in front of my eyes now.

21:13.449 --> 21:15.268
He doesn't know of your existence.

21:15.269 --> 21:16.749
What?

21:16.789 --> 21:21.158
I thought about him every day for 28 years
and he doesn't even know of my existence?

21:21.159 --> 21:27.088
- Let's go. Let me meet him right away.
- Kyung Hee!

21:27.089 --> 21:29.828
What happened back then?

21:29.829 --> 21:33.179
Why couldn't Moo Yul come back?

21:34.419 --> 21:38.169
When the time comes,
I'll tell you everything.

21:45.489 --> 21:50.178
I was sorry... and I'm sorry.

21:50.179 --> 21:53.609
I wanted to tell you that.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.669
My child.

22:02.659 --> 22:05.439
What's his name?

22:07.609 --> 22:11.246
John... John Lee.

23:10.619 --> 23:13.488
It must have been really hard for you
all this time.

23:13.489 --> 23:18.088
I heard everything from the manager.
What about your brother?

23:18.089 --> 23:19.099
Prison.

23:19.139 --> 23:22.328
What are you going to do?
A crime is a crime.

23:22.329 --> 23:25.778
You should be thankful
they're only cutting 6 months of your wages!

23:25.779 --> 23:31.209
Our whole team sent in a group petition
letter to beg for leniency for your brother.

23:31.519 --> 23:33.598
Thank you, Chief.

23:33.599 --> 23:35.808
Let's get back to work.

23:35.809 --> 23:37.818
There's a lot to do.

23:37.819 --> 23:41.939
Bring me the security systems plan
when you're done.

23:43.519 --> 23:45.080
Mr. President.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.638
What are you doing here?

23:51.139 --> 23:57.068
I thought I should come by since the recent
hacking incident must have shocked everyone.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.745
No, actually it has made us
a lot more vigilant while we work.

24:00.746 --> 24:02.959
Everyone is working diligently.

24:04.269 --> 24:08.168
This place is the heart
of Korea's intelligence agency.

24:08.169 --> 24:10.848
Don't think of this as an ordinary job.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.597
As citizens of our country,
look upon your jobs

24:12.598 --> 24:17.731
as safeguarding
the last defenses of the nation.

24:17.759 --> 24:19.019
Yes, Sir.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.988
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung, please see me.

24:23.589 --> 24:24.829
Me?

24:26.759 --> 24:30.998
Did you say your parents are in the US?

24:30.999 --> 24:32.279
Yes.

24:33.319 --> 24:35.503
I envy your father.

24:35.504 --> 24:39.386
Your dad raised such a great son
and even sent him back to S. Korea.

24:39.389 --> 24:43.749
But why am I having
such a hard time raising mine?

24:43.779 --> 24:46.248
You've seen my youngest daughter, Da Hye.
Right?

24:46.249 --> 24:49.418
She used to run away
if we even mentioned the word study.

24:49.419 --> 24:52.778
I don't know what changed her mind,
but she says she wants to study these days.

24:52.779 --> 24:55.838
But, she has never focused on her studies.

24:55.839 --> 24:58.908
She seems to be lost.

25:00.489 --> 25:02.730
Which is why I'm asking...

25:04.622 --> 25:08.747
Can you possibly tutor Da Hye?

25:08.799 --> 25:10.109
Me?

25:10.549 --> 25:13.568
Don't think of this
as an order from the president.

25:13.569 --> 25:18.688
Think of this as a father
requesting for his bratty daughter.

25:18.689 --> 25:23.669
Can you help out until the college exams?

25:24.429 --> 25:25.862
Mr. President.

25:26.269 --> 25:29.118
Doesn't the academy at least have
an opening anniversary day or something?

25:29.119 --> 25:31.688
How can there be no days off?

25:31.689 --> 25:33.406
Just push through.

25:34.149 --> 25:36.488
Do you know how it feels
to be a repeat student?

25:36.489 --> 25:38.738
I got in on my third try.

25:38.739 --> 25:41.379
Well, isn't that
something to be proud of...?

25:45.849 --> 25:47.649
Hello.

25:47.669 --> 25:49.379
Dad?

25:50.449 --> 25:51.889
Really?!

25:51.909 --> 25:56.439
You're for real, right?!
You're the best dad!

25:57.519 --> 25:59.548
Da Hye, where are you going?
What about the academy?

25:59.549 --> 26:03.968
That's Chanel Chance Bath and Shower gel.

26:03.969 --> 26:04.669
You know it?

26:04.670 --> 26:07.442
I bought that and got in so much trouble
with my mom.

26:07.443 --> 26:08.843
She said I was being too lavish.

26:08.849 --> 26:12.409
Unni, you must have a lot of money.

26:12.509 --> 26:13.730
Da Hye!

26:22.059 --> 26:23.558
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung!

26:23.559 --> 26:28.449
Since you're going to tutor me,
how about we start today?

26:31.339 --> 26:32.539
Hey!

26:32.859 --> 26:35.298
How refreshing.

26:35.299 --> 26:38.929
Why is this place so far?

26:41.959 --> 26:47.209
You use
Chanel Chance Bath and Shower gel too?

26:48.259 --> 26:50.219
What's up with you two?

26:50.220 --> 26:52.569
Why do you use the same stuff?
How annoying.

26:52.604 --> 26:55.468
It's like you guys
are living together or something.

26:55.469 --> 26:58.808
Forget that!
Let's do Tuesdays and Thursdays, 6-8.

26:58.809 --> 26:59.608
Let's do Saturday too.

26:59.609 --> 27:01.148
Work 5 days and rest 2.
I never break that golden rule.

27:01.149 --> 27:03.118
What about dinner?
You don't eat?

27:03.119 --> 27:05.518
I get tired when I eat.
You can eat if you want.

27:05.519 --> 27:07.378
Then let's eat after we finish.

27:07.379 --> 27:09.778
I'll tell my mom
to prepare something for us.

27:09.779 --> 27:13.888
I'm telling you this ahead of time, I have
a lot of things on my schedule at night.

27:13.889 --> 27:14.938
Especially at night...

27:14.939 --> 27:19.518
And don't like me.
A kid like you isn't my type.

27:19.519 --> 27:22.388
What's your type?

27:22.389 --> 27:23.849
Me?

27:25.989 --> 27:28.408
A girl with long black hair,

27:28.409 --> 27:29.848
who's pretty when she smiles,

27:29.849 --> 27:33.828
makes good kimchi jjigae, likes dogs,
and sings well.

27:33.829 --> 27:35.569
That's me!

27:35.609 --> 27:38.308
I guess Sae Hee unni made him kimchi jjigae.

27:38.309 --> 27:42.169
A kid like you is definitely not it.

27:44.729 --> 27:48.118
I can learn how to make kimchi jjigae!

27:48.119 --> 27:51.189
Why is he always calling me a kid?

27:53.149 --> 27:59.122
Unni, I think my studying will go really
well if I have a sweet cup of coffee.

28:00.109 --> 28:01.948
Okay, I'll make it for you.

28:01.949 --> 28:04.088
Me too, while you're at it.

28:04.089 --> 28:09.208
Okay. I'll make it
so you go study and you look after her.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.676
Yes, Ma'am!

28:12.449 --> 28:16.439
<i>You used my shower gel, right?
Make me coffee.</i>

28:16.469 --> 28:20.719
Why does he always have to drink the coffee
that I make?

28:27.089 --> 28:28.698
How stingy.

28:28.699 --> 28:31.028
You're making me make you coffee
because I just used some of your shower gel?

28:31.029 --> 28:33.380
I like that a lot, okay?

28:33.381 --> 28:37.710
They ran out of stock and I was 28th on the
waiting list, so I almost couldn't buy it!

28:37.739 --> 28:39.336
Doenjang* guy. (*likes expensive things,
especially name brand imports.)

28:39.337 --> 28:40.912
Drink up.

28:44.909 --> 28:46.968
It tastes good.

28:46.969 --> 28:50.668
How come I can't make this taste?
Give me your recipe.

28:50.669 --> 28:53.818
What recipe?
You're done, right?

28:53.819 --> 28:55.688
Oh, you have a something there.

28:55.689 --> 29:00.348
Leave it.
Do that for Sae Hee unni instead.

29:00.349 --> 29:03.518
It's really bothering you, huh?

29:03.519 --> 29:05.278
Stop pretending like it's not!

29:05.279 --> 29:08.488
Bothering me?
You're talking such nonsense!

29:08.489 --> 29:11.348
You're even flustered.

29:11.749 --> 29:14.449
Why is she so flustered?

29:20.059 --> 29:23.248
The oldest son Seo Dong Jee was excused
from the army for his hypertension,

29:23.249 --> 29:26.181
But apparently he recently sent in his
application for the marine plant life team

29:26.182 --> 29:27.862
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute in America.

29:27.869 --> 29:28.769
So?

29:28.799 --> 29:33.958
It's really hard for a person
with high blood pressure to handle the job.

29:33.959 --> 29:36.958
So they have a requirement
for a health test.

29:36.959 --> 29:38.139
So?

29:38.559 --> 29:41.669
So I'm saying let's set a trap.

29:49.029 --> 29:50.638
Lee Yoon Sung.

29:50.939 --> 29:53.568
Of course.
You're so smart!

29:53.569 --> 29:56.938
Okay!
Then I'll get the second son.

29:56.939 --> 29:58.309
That's it.

29:58.349 --> 30:01.459
Okay, they're both dead.

30:01.819 --> 30:05.493
Little bastard, not going to the army...
His dad was even a general, right?!

30:07.649 --> 30:10.090
According to the reports I received,

30:10.091 --> 30:13.672
you carried Lee Kyung Wan on your back*
(*a metaphor)

30:13.769 --> 30:15.724
and lobbied a member of the Defense Ministry

30:15.725 --> 30:18.605
to change the standards to accept
delivery of military boots.

30:18.609 --> 30:19.748
Is this true?

30:19.749 --> 30:21.648
It's nonsense.

30:21.649 --> 30:27.068
It's a rumor created
so that I won't be elected.

30:27.069 --> 30:28.829
Is it?

30:29.169 --> 30:30.579
Okay.

30:30.599 --> 30:33.798
Then we'll say that's that.

30:33.799 --> 30:38.338
But, how can you purchase defective
military boots with soles that fall off?

30:38.339 --> 30:42.278
These are the boots that
South Korean military men have to wear.

30:42.279 --> 30:44.974
You were once a military man.

30:44.975 --> 30:47.017
So, you must have had views different
from average people.

30:47.069 --> 30:51.658
Well, when you accept delivery of goods,
it's sometimes defective...

30:51.659 --> 30:56.348
Sometimes?
It's 7 percent of the boots.

30:56.349 --> 30:58.958
- How is that sometimes?
- I...

30:58.959 --> 31:02.444
I merely followed a legal procedure. There's
no proof I've done anything out of line.

31:02.449 --> 31:06.048
I'm not asking you to debate the legality
or illegality of your act right now!

31:06.049 --> 31:09.388
I'm asking you, Candidate Seo, as a military
man yourself, if South Korean soldiers

31:09.389 --> 31:14.279
should be wearing
these defective military boots right now!?

31:16.649 --> 31:21.598
Have you changed?
Or have you always been like this?

31:21.599 --> 31:24.338
The Seo Yong Hak
that I've known for over 30 years

31:24.339 --> 31:30.289
had a warm heart
and had a big vision for the country.

31:31.299 --> 31:35.368
Which candidate are you planning to back?

31:35.369 --> 31:37.627
Are you going to force a former comrade
into a tight corner

31:37.628 --> 31:39.915
and make me drop out of the election?

31:39.949 --> 31:44.128
- Candidate Seo!
- Yeah, do what you want.

31:44.129 --> 31:47.248
But let me tell you something.

31:47.249 --> 31:51.368
Where there is a setting sun,
there is a rising sun.

31:51.369 --> 31:56.458
And it may become a powerful force.

31:56.459 --> 32:02.379
I hope that you decide well
which side you'll choose.

32:03.359 --> 32:08.489
I have to go attend
the joint election speech.

32:08.799 --> 32:11.109
Excuse me.

32:28.439 --> 32:31.458
The future progress and development
of Korea

32:31.459 --> 32:34.908
does not lie solely
in technological innovation,

32:34.909 --> 32:37.258
but also in how we build social trust

32:37.259 --> 32:41.518
between our nation and its people.

32:41.519 --> 32:45.118
It lies in how we develop that trust.

32:45.119 --> 32:47.068
This sort of trust must be built

32:47.069 --> 32:50.708
so the people can dream and have hope.

32:50.709 --> 32:55.568
And we will live
being proud of the power of the people.

32:55.569 --> 33:03.459
I am hoping to become the cornerstone
upon which this trust is built, Everyone!

33:13.409 --> 33:15.379
Everyone.

33:15.409 --> 33:18.876
The dishonesty and hypocrisy
shown by politicians

33:18.877 --> 33:23.190
have led citizens
to feel disappointed and betrayed.

33:23.425 --> 33:25.916
Who will be responsible
for establishing policies

33:25.917 --> 33:27.932
that will benefit the nation and its people?

33:27.967 --> 33:33.268
How can we console the citizens
who have turned their backs?

33:33.269 --> 33:34.429
Thank you.

33:34.549 --> 33:35.369
Thank you.

33:35.489 --> 33:37.029
Thank you.

33:41.229 --> 33:43.178
What are you doing here?

33:43.179 --> 33:47.248
Excuse me,
I was wondering if you knew who this is.

33:47.249 --> 33:49.268
Who is this?

33:49.269 --> 33:50.608
I don't know.

33:50.609 --> 33:51.808
Look carefully.

33:51.809 --> 33:56.198
Did you see him at the Cherbourg Restaurant
or any other place?

33:56.199 --> 33:58.048
What about you, Honey?
Have you seen him before?

33:58.049 --> 34:00.808
I haven't.
Who is he?

34:00.809 --> 34:04.788
Never mind. He's just someone
who has been placed on the suspect list.

34:04.789 --> 34:07.548
You came all the way here
to find out about that?

34:07.549 --> 34:10.717
You're working hard on my case.

34:10.719 --> 34:16.658
Thank you. But it's more of a problem to me
that you're not cooperating.

34:17.859 --> 34:20.568
Now, let's get going.

34:51.139 --> 34:52.958
Pretty!
Get in.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.192
I'll take you.

34:55.659 --> 34:57.442
I said get in.

34:58.799 --> 35:02.768
I can take the bus, go on ahead.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.328
Your legs hurt too.

35:04.329 --> 35:07.333
I'm fine, just go ahead.

35:11.249 --> 35:14.592
If you get in,
your legs will get better.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.259
Yoon Sung, hurry up and come.
Na Na is in trouble.

35:32.539 --> 35:35.959
I said I'll get rid of your tiredness.

35:37.739 --> 35:40.703
What do you think Candidate Seo
will think

35:40.704 --> 35:43.004
if he finds out that his son
is treating his security agent like this?

35:43.049 --> 35:43.948
Don't do this.

35:43.949 --> 35:46.594
Don't be so stubborn, come on.

35:50.139 --> 35:53.698
Do I have to put up a sign
that says you're my girl?

35:53.699 --> 35:56.195
Who is he?
Your boyfriend?

35:56.759 --> 35:58.988
Who do you think I am to act like this?

35:58.989 --> 36:01.618
Who cares whoever you are?

36:01.619 --> 36:04.488
Go whine to your daddy.

36:04.489 --> 36:05.919
Let's go.

36:08.169 --> 36:09.519
What the...?

36:16.159 --> 36:19.274
That bastard...
He's not getting away with this.

36:22.589 --> 36:27.649
What the...? Oh, my gosh.
It's not like I belong to someone.

36:27.789 --> 36:30.128
Either way, thank you Lee Yoon Sung.

36:30.129 --> 36:32.668
Hey, are you showing discrimination?

36:32.669 --> 36:35.288
You should flip him over like you do to me,
what are you doing?

36:35.289 --> 36:38.348
I already got a warning for overprotecting.

36:38.349 --> 36:41.648
If I do that,
they won't let me off the hook.

36:41.649 --> 36:44.368
You're afraid of getting yelled at,
so sexual harassment isn't anything to you?

36:44.369 --> 36:47.408
Sexual harassment?
Lee Yoon Sung.

36:47.409 --> 36:50.448
Or, are you mad
that you didn't get dragged off by him?

36:50.449 --> 36:54.578
Yeah, I have no idea what you're thinking.

36:54.579 --> 36:58.068
That's such a player's way of thinking.

36:58.069 --> 37:01.268
But, what are you doing here?

37:01.269 --> 37:04.108
I wanted to check out
a joint speech session, why?

37:04.109 --> 37:08.449
And I wanted to see how different
elections were in Korea and America.

37:08.459 --> 37:12.519
Ahh, so you had those profound thoughts.

37:18.209 --> 37:19.229
Yeah.

37:19.259 --> 37:20.879
Go sunbae?

37:21.399 --> 37:23.271
I'm on my way.

37:25.639 --> 37:27.258
You're here.

37:27.759 --> 37:31.628
Oh, Unni.
Why are you arriving with my tutor?

37:31.629 --> 37:36.648
Oh? We coincidentally met out front,
coincidentally.

37:36.649 --> 37:37.849
Yeah?

37:37.969 --> 37:39.938
Teacher, sit here.

37:39.939 --> 37:43.679
I saved it just for you
so no one else can sit here.

37:54.699 --> 37:57.958
Thanks to you guys who signed a petition,
Gi Hyuk was released.

37:57.959 --> 37:59.858
I should at least buy dinner.

37:59.859 --> 38:01.358
Da Hye, thank you for coming too.

38:01.359 --> 38:03.738
Eun Ah unni really wanted to come.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.268
She couldn't come if I didn't come,
so I just came.

38:06.269 --> 38:07.658
When did I say that?

38:07.659 --> 38:10.923
You said you were craving meat
at the academy before,

38:10.924 --> 38:14.083
and that you could kill two birds
with one stone and get a free meal.

38:17.939 --> 38:20.188
Don't feel down
that you went to a detention center.

38:20.189 --> 38:23.928
There isn't a tough kid
who hasn't done a round in there before.

38:23.929 --> 38:25.021
But thanks to you guys,

38:25.022 --> 38:28.687
the people responsible for the
defective goods have all stepped down.

38:28.769 --> 38:33.149
Let's cheer to that.
Here. Let's take a shot.

38:36.550 --> 38:37.291
Stop it!

38:38.092 --> 38:39.392
I said I don't want any.

38:39.629 --> 38:42.138
I'm sorry about what happened
because of me.

38:42.139 --> 38:43.958
I was really frustrated.

38:43.959 --> 38:45.851
I wanted someone to hear
what I had to say,

38:45.852 --> 38:49.077
so that way, what happened to me
won't happen again.

38:49.329 --> 38:53.638
I hate that I lost a leg,
but I really don't regret going to the army.

38:53.639 --> 38:55.887
I was just unlucky.

39:00.209 --> 39:01.089
Teacher.

39:01.109 --> 39:05.518
Why do you keep acting like this?
I told you not to drink. Are you even drunk?

39:05.519 --> 39:10.689
Is there an earthquake?
Why is the ground shaking so much?

39:10.839 --> 39:13.958
There are two agents,
what are you guys doing?

39:13.959 --> 39:16.578
We all know you're not drunk.

39:16.579 --> 39:17.931
Is it obvious?

39:20.499 --> 39:21.459
Let's go.

39:21.479 --> 39:24.968
Teacher, I have a question.

39:24.969 --> 39:26.578
What is this?

39:26.579 --> 39:28.458
This one, question 8.

39:28.459 --> 39:31.928
Set S, which contains a 2 x 1 matrix,

39:31.929 --> 39:36.188
times T, which contains a 1 x 2 matrix,
equals the following.

39:36.189 --> 39:39.878
What's going on?
Why is Da Hye calling Lee Yoon Sung teacher?

39:39.879 --> 39:43.648
He's my tutor.
Although we haven't officially started yet.

39:43.649 --> 39:46.068
Da Hye, you're really on fire to study.

39:46.069 --> 39:47.988
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:47.989 --> 39:49.708
Hey, Kim Na Na. Kim Na Na.

39:49.709 --> 39:54.528
It's kind of weird doing it here, right?
Do you want to go to a cafe?

39:54.529 --> 39:59.708
Da Hye, can we go do it at the Blue House?
I want to leave for home. Yeah?

39:59.709 --> 40:04.169
Unni, cooperate with me
so I can go to college.

40:05.339 --> 40:06.608
I don't want to.

40:06.609 --> 40:07.649
Let's go.

40:07.679 --> 40:09.329
- I said no.
- Cafe.

40:09.349 --> 40:10.478
- Do it yourself.
- Cafe.

40:10.479 --> 40:12.239
I said no.

40:12.259 --> 40:14.998
I'm the manager at Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute, John Lee.

40:14.999 --> 40:17.588
I'm the director at Trust Life,
Park Kim.

40:17.589 --> 40:21.098
You're saying Trust Life
is offering to insure my whole family?

40:21.099 --> 40:22.428
And the company is going to pay for it all?

40:22.429 --> 40:27.078
You're the family of the soon to be
president, this is nothing to us.

40:27.079 --> 40:31.018
Ah, yes. I've sent in my resume
to the marine life research team.

40:31.019 --> 40:36.968
First of all, it's really an honor to have
someone like you applying to our facility.

40:37.269 --> 40:40.140
The noblesse oblige we talked about
last time,

40:40.141 --> 40:42.758
we say it's an insurance
but we're just giving it to you.

40:42.799 --> 40:45.842
No matter what happens to you
even outside the country,

40:45.843 --> 40:48.727
we're able to provide faster and friendlier
service than our country's embassy.

40:48.769 --> 40:50.359
Cancer?

40:50.719 --> 40:53.608
You sign the special contract
and the moment you get cancer,

40:53.609 --> 40:55.298
our insurance will cover it 100 percent,

40:55.333 --> 40:57.102
without even asking what kind of cancer
if there be one.

40:57.109 --> 40:59.079
Oh, really?

40:59.159 --> 41:01.728
Then please take care of it.

41:01.729 --> 41:05.008
For the rest of the family, just give me
the paperwork and I'll get it all handled.

41:05.009 --> 41:07.728
But there's one thing
that kind of bothers me.

41:07.729 --> 41:09.908
I heard you were excused from the army
because of your high blood pressure.

41:09.909 --> 41:16.508
But, there's nothing wrong with your family
but you got excused from the army, right?

41:16.509 --> 41:18.818
I heard it was the after effects
of an accident.

41:18.819 --> 41:20.408
Does that cause a problem?

41:20.409 --> 41:23.018
Due to the high underwater pressures,

41:23.019 --> 41:25.008
it's going to be hard for someone
with hypertension to work tenaciously.

41:25.009 --> 41:27.428
Everything about this insurance is great...

41:27.429 --> 41:31.928
But if one person in the family is sick,
the entire family can't qualify.

41:31.929 --> 41:36.428
I could face a lawsuit
if I hire without checking such things.

41:36.429 --> 41:42.299
Oh, the truth is...

41:44.929 --> 41:47.158
The truth is...

41:47.159 --> 41:49.679
Oh, that?

41:49.769 --> 41:51.478
The truth is...

41:51.479 --> 41:54.068
The truth is I don't have hypertension.

41:54.069 --> 41:58.169
The truth is there's nothing like that.

42:02.279 --> 42:05.528
You are indeed a general's son.

42:05.529 --> 42:08.398
I'm sorry, but you have to send me
your results from a medical examination.

42:08.399 --> 42:12.768
Then you can go to our facility
and get a medical examination, right?

42:12.769 --> 42:13.469
Of course.

42:13.479 --> 42:16.148
You just have to check
that my health is fine, right?

42:16.149 --> 42:18.618
Yeah, I'll take care of everything,
so don't worry about it.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.119
Of course.

42:29.839 --> 42:31.788
Here.
The second son's...

42:31.789 --> 42:36.028
The physical exam says he's perfectly fine,
very healthy!

42:36.029 --> 42:39.308
I asked him how he faked the test results
for glomerulonephritis...

42:39.309 --> 42:41.064
And you know coffee mix?

42:41.229 --> 42:43.908
He said if you drink about 30 of those,
the x-rays come out like that.

42:43.909 --> 42:45.598
Ahjussi, you're great.

42:45.599 --> 42:47.798
You're good at this.

42:48.299 --> 42:51.808
When you play go-stop or poker, you do it
by looking at everyone else's actions.

42:51.809 --> 42:55.578
No matter what kind of poker face they have,
I can still see right through it.

42:55.579 --> 42:57.689
Let's go eat.

42:59.199 --> 43:02.908
<i>Come quickly!
Studying is so much fun. Da Hye.</i>

43:02.909 --> 43:04.898
I'm going crazy.

43:04.899 --> 43:06.379
Why?

43:06.929 --> 43:09.588
Ahjussi, let's eat next time.
I have to go to my part-time job.

43:09.589 --> 43:11.858
What part-time job?
You have a full-time job.

43:11.859 --> 43:13.448
There's something like that.

43:13.849 --> 43:17.678
Yoon Sung.
Hey, do I have to eat alone all the time?

43:17.679 --> 43:19.998
You don't need anything else,
you just have to memorize these words.

43:19.999 --> 43:24.419
Verb plus preposition
plus the passive voice...

43:25.819 --> 43:30.258
Hey Kid, did you put lasers in your eyes?
You're going to make a hole in my body.

43:30.259 --> 43:31.908
Stop saying kid.

43:31.909 --> 43:34.148
What else would I call a kid?

43:34.149 --> 43:36.428
What did I just say?

43:36.829 --> 43:38.289
Teacher.

43:38.309 --> 43:41.008
How do you say a statuesque good-looking man
in English?

43:41.009 --> 43:41.709
What?

43:41.710 --> 43:45.908
You surprise yourself
when you look in the mirror, right?

43:45.909 --> 43:47.229
I do too.

43:47.669 --> 43:49.931
I'm going crazy.

43:51.649 --> 43:53.868
Hey, focus!

43:54.369 --> 43:57.368
Lee Yoon Sung, you can't hit her.

43:57.369 --> 44:02.709
The president approved it,
he said I can use any method to teach her.

44:08.289 --> 44:10.708
<i>The youngest of Seo Yong Hak's sons
is at the MiMi Club.</i>

44:10.709 --> 44:12.548
Time's up.
I'm going.

44:12.549 --> 44:14.608
What about dinner?
Let's eat together.

44:14.609 --> 44:15.808
I'm hungry.

44:15.809 --> 44:20.108
I told you, I'm especially busy at night.

44:20.109 --> 44:21.658
You better look over this.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.257
You're very busy.

44:32.039 --> 44:38.029
How am I supposed to calm this heart
by only seeing him for two hours?

44:38.809 --> 44:41.018
That ruined my mood.

44:41.319 --> 44:43.478
Unni, get ready.

44:43.479 --> 44:46.028
I have to go work my body.

44:46.029 --> 44:47.279
Again?

45:28.329 --> 45:29.928
Who are you?

45:30.229 --> 45:33.429
Let go and let's talk.

45:36.309 --> 45:38.218
Meeting like this is fate.

45:38.219 --> 45:41.399
Let's go talk somewhere quiet.

45:42.759 --> 45:46.429
Let go.
I said let go.

45:49.119 --> 45:50.209
You again?

45:50.239 --> 45:52.738
I told you I'd get mad
if you touch things that belong to me.

45:52.739 --> 45:55.478
Get mad?
Do you really want to get mad tonight?

45:55.479 --> 45:58.740
Girls that I want I always get.

46:00.129 --> 46:02.328
You're laughing.

46:03.129 --> 46:04.539
Come out.

46:07.089 --> 46:09.439
Teacher, no.

46:21.269 --> 46:23.278
You can't even take a punch.

46:23.279 --> 46:26.631
You just wanted to act cool
in front of the ladies.

46:36.579 --> 46:38.979
That bastard...

46:41.399 --> 46:43.708
Unni, do something.

46:43.709 --> 46:47.678
I won't run away so save Teacher.
Yeah? Yeah?

46:47.679 --> 46:52.419
We can't, that's outside our line of duty.

46:56.049 --> 46:57.585
Unlucky Jerk, you fool.

46:57.586 --> 47:01.007
I taught him so much,
he can't even fight back?

47:07.059 --> 47:11.448
Yes, Boss.
The guy at the hospital last time...

47:11.449 --> 47:16.899
I don't think he's the City Hunter.
He's quite weak.

47:17.589 --> 47:21.159
But I will keep watching him.

47:24.059 --> 47:25.859
Oh, Jerk.

47:30.339 --> 47:32.028
That must have really hurt.

47:32.029 --> 47:37.960
- You, Jerk! How...?
- Who are you? What a loser.

47:46.209 --> 47:47.899
Let go!

47:48.329 --> 47:49.758
I said don't do it.

47:49.759 --> 47:50.979
Let go.

47:50.999 --> 47:52.048
Should I call the police?

47:52.049 --> 47:54.748
Forget it.
It's pointless making a big deal of this.

47:54.749 --> 47:56.318
It's Seo Yong Hak's youngest son.

47:56.319 --> 47:59.738
Yeah, it is the youngest son.

47:59.739 --> 48:03.358
Look here Youngest Prince,
you should hurry up and leave.

48:03.359 --> 48:07.298
The bystanders nearby
seemed to have called someone.

48:07.299 --> 48:10.278
How about it?
Don't you hear some sirens?

48:10.279 --> 48:13.799
Let go!
I can only leave if you let go!

48:20.169 --> 48:21.328
Where's Lee Yoon Sung?

48:21.329 --> 48:22.528
He disappeared.

48:22.529 --> 48:26.858
He must have been embarrassed
that he got beat up in front of us.

48:26.859 --> 48:32.409
Oh, no.
We shouldn't have watched.

48:55.129 --> 49:00.889
You told me to use non-scarring bandages
and you just put on whatever.

49:01.829 --> 49:03.335
Move your hand.

49:04.739 --> 49:06.968
I don't want to use something
someone else was using.

49:06.969 --> 49:08.378
Quiet down.

49:08.979 --> 49:10.678
I don't want to.

49:11.379 --> 49:12.589
Quiet.

49:13.499 --> 49:15.149
I don't want to.

49:22.729 --> 49:25.898
I taught you so much.
You couldn't even hit him once.

49:25.899 --> 49:28.728
Do you know how embarrassed I was
in front of Agent Shin?

49:28.729 --> 49:29.968
Why were you embarrassed
in front of Agent Shin?

49:29.969 --> 49:33.008
Because you're worse than Go Ki Joon!

49:33.009 --> 49:34.898
I thought you were worrying about me.

49:34.899 --> 49:37.378
Either way,
starting tomorrow it's hardcore training.

49:37.379 --> 49:41.018
I'll work you
so that you won't get beat up again.

49:41.019 --> 49:42.359
I'm going to get beat up everyday.

49:45.689 --> 49:48.798
Ahjussi, you filmed it well
so that my face doesn't show.

49:48.799 --> 49:50.658
<i>Of course.
What is there that I can't do?</i>

49:50.659 --> 49:54.938
But, hey. You're okay where you got hit?
You seemed to have gotten hit hard.

49:54.939 --> 49:59.169
I'm fine.
It won't scar thanks to someone.

49:59.648 --> 50:00.948
[E-MAIL: You've got mail]

50:01.649 --> 50:02.908
Oh, Ahjussi.

50:02.909 --> 50:05.368
Seo Dong Min sent the stuff I told him to.

50:05.369 --> 50:07.129
Really?

50:08.649 --> 50:12.138
That idiot, he got fooled.

50:12.139 --> 50:13.059
Idiot.

50:13.079 --> 50:16.568
He probably didn't expect this to be sent
to the military service office, right?

50:16.569 --> 50:19.750
It's time to show him everyone is equal
in the eyes of the law, Yoon Sung.

50:19.751 --> 50:21.154
Right?

50:31.459 --> 50:32.489
Yeah.

50:32.690 --> 50:37.353
For being accepted at the research facility
overseas that you wanted to go to...

50:37.361 --> 50:38.111
Congratulations.

50:38.119 --> 50:38.998
Have a safe trip.

50:38.999 --> 50:42.168
I'll call you
as soon as I find a house in America.

50:42.169 --> 50:45.338
The election is almost here,
I'm sorry I can't help.

50:45.339 --> 50:46.659
It's okay.

50:46.709 --> 50:49.378
Dong Eun and I
will take Hyung to the airport.

50:49.379 --> 50:51.619
He's got quite a lot of luggage.

51:05.169 --> 51:06.419
Sir.

51:08.769 --> 51:09.988
- What is going on?
- Sir.

51:09.989 --> 51:11.259
- Sir.
- Sir.

51:12.449 --> 51:14.921
What is going on?

51:15.579 --> 51:16.589
Salute.

51:16.729 --> 51:17.949
Salute.

51:18.169 --> 51:19.518
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

51:19.519 --> 51:21.358
I came from the military service office.

51:21.359 --> 51:22.538
The service office?

51:22.539 --> 51:26.778
The applications your 3 sons sent by email
were well received.

51:26.779 --> 51:31.168
From the test results, we have determined
your sons are all healthy to be enlisted.

51:31.169 --> 51:33.608
Especially watching the video clip
of your youngest son,

51:33.609 --> 51:36.048
we have determined that his knee

51:36.049 --> 51:38.298
has completely healed and will
cause no harm while serving in the army.

51:38.299 --> 51:40.958
All 3 have been accepted
and will be enlisted.

51:40.959 --> 51:45.748
They'll be good role models for the citizens
for enlisting after their health improved.

51:45.749 --> 51:47.757
There are rumors you are using

51:47.758 --> 51:51.896
the enlistment of all 3 of your sons
to support your campaign.

51:52.089 --> 51:56.118
Did they recover or was there nothing
to recover from to begin with?

51:56.119 --> 51:59.218
Oh... yes, yes.

51:59.219 --> 52:03.358
We were going to send them off quietly
but I'm taken aback

52:03.359 --> 52:06.868
that the public got wind of it.

52:06.869 --> 52:11.278
If you are a Korean male citizens,
you should all go to the army.

52:11.279 --> 52:16.616
So I told them a speedy recovery and
enlistment is the way to serve the country.

52:16.617 --> 52:20.420
This is what I've always taught them.

52:20.424 --> 52:23.768
Three Sons... You have already
prepared for your enlistment.

52:23.769 --> 52:26.398
You don't need all these things,
only your body has to come.

52:26.399 --> 52:30.409
I brought the military car.
Please get in.

52:32.849 --> 52:35.349
Dad... Mom...

52:38.839 --> 52:40.618
Youngest...

52:40.619 --> 52:41.738
I don't know anything about this.

52:41.739 --> 52:43.338
Youngest Son...

52:44.239 --> 52:46.618
- How do you feel right now, Sir?
- Yes...

52:46.619 --> 52:49.949
- Honey, Honey...
- Are you okay?

52:55.350 --> 52:56.350
Goodbye!

52:56.359 --> 53:01.359
In Korea, a man should...

53:01.399 --> 53:03.505
<i>The three sons of former Minister
of National Defense, Assemblyman Seo</i>

53:03.506 --> 53:06.127
<i>have arrived at the Nonsan Training Center.</i>

53:06.149 --> 53:10.558
<i>Experts have said
that all three sons enlisting in the army</i>

53:10.559 --> 53:16.549
<i>will be a great benefit to the candidate
for the election in a couple of days.</i>

53:17.219 --> 53:19.058
How did this happen?

53:19.059 --> 53:20.818
Voluntary enlistment?

53:20.819 --> 53:22.179
I did it.

53:23.239 --> 53:24.079
What?

53:24.099 --> 53:26.148
I turned it into a voluntary enlistment.

53:26.149 --> 53:26.855
Is this what you meant

53:26.856 --> 53:29.709
when you said you'd show them
everyone is equal in the eyes of the law?

53:29.744 --> 53:31.548
By raising Seo Yong Hak's popularity?!

53:31.549 --> 53:33.681
We'll destroy him when the time comes,

53:33.682 --> 53:36.521
but we have to console
the citizens who feel betrayed.

53:36.609 --> 53:40.628
"My son had a hard time in the army
while someone else's doesn't have to go."

53:40.629 --> 53:44.188
Who is going to console
the weak and powerless citizens

53:44.189 --> 53:45.808
who don't have people watching their backs?

53:45.809 --> 53:47.109
Console?

53:47.759 --> 53:51.788
What if Candidate Seo wins the election?

53:51.789 --> 53:54.739
I'm going to send him to the highest place

53:54.740 --> 53:56.351
and then make him take a plunge.

53:57.889 --> 54:01.468
You've become very arrogant
since I last saw you.

54:01.469 --> 54:03.948
Opportunities don't come around that often.

54:03.949 --> 54:05.533
Because of your act of bravado,

54:05.534 --> 54:08.768
Seo Yong Hak has escaped
into the shelter of public opinion.

54:09.349 --> 54:11.338
Don't worry.

54:11.339 --> 54:14.148
The only one who can undo
the bell that's been tied around the neck

54:14.149 --> 54:17.429
is the one who tied it there
in the first place.

54:17.699 --> 54:23.149
In three days, at the election,
I'll make sure he takes the plunge.

54:26.719 --> 54:29.678
Prosecutor...
It's as expected.

54:29.679 --> 54:33.248
HNC made 7 transfers into the account of
Candidate Seo's daughter, Seo Dong Hye,

54:33.249 --> 54:36.078
As expected, it's a dummy company
they created in a tax haven.

54:36.079 --> 54:39.678
In other words,
it's a bogus company created by Maris.

54:39.679 --> 54:41.485
The bank account under a false name
has been uncovered,

54:41.486 --> 54:43.455
and it's confirmed
that the money was deposited.

54:43.469 --> 54:45.133
What's the point of hesitating any longer?

54:45.134 --> 54:47.592
Let's get an arrest warrant
for Candidate Seo immediately.

54:47.599 --> 54:50.278
But tomorrow is the last day of campaign
activities, do you think it will be okay?

54:50.279 --> 54:51.954
Based on the trend right now,

54:51.955 --> 54:54.790
I believe he's certain to be the
New People's Party Presidential Candidate.

54:54.839 --> 54:58.268
The minute the warrant is issued tomorrow,
quickly get a search and seizure warrant.

54:58.269 --> 55:01.526
Let's reveal
what's beyond the tip of the iceberg.

55:03.089 --> 55:08.029
<i>[New People's Party National Convention
and Presidential Candidate Primary Election]</i>

55:22.549 --> 55:23.518
Is there anything wrong?

55:23.519 --> 55:24.889
<i>Yes.</i>

55:39.929 --> 55:40.629
Ahjussi.

55:40.630 --> 55:42.898
- You scared me.
- You're ready?

55:42.899 --> 55:44.328
Why are you so late?

55:44.329 --> 55:48.118
I had to go to the Korea Communications
Commission (KCC) and lost some time.

55:48.119 --> 55:49.648
You should have taken a day off.

55:49.649 --> 55:52.898
If I take too many days off,
it'll look suspicious.

55:52.899 --> 55:55.298
You're doing a good careful job.

55:55.299 --> 55:56.818
Here, press tag.

55:56.819 --> 55:58.019
Yeah.

55:59.129 --> 56:01.103
Go to the control room on the second floor

56:01.104 --> 56:03.984
and plug this in the computer that
looks like this when I give you the signal.

56:03.989 --> 56:08.069
I already put a program in there
so that it will automatically play.

56:08.449 --> 56:09.328
Will it go okay?

56:09.329 --> 56:14.378
Don't shake like it's your first time.
This is your specialty.

56:14.379 --> 56:15.388
Do I look like
I work at this broadcasting company?

56:15.389 --> 56:18.808
- Button this up, like this.
- It won't button...

56:18.809 --> 56:22.139
Lose some weight.

56:26.609 --> 56:28.428
I'm Prosecutor Kim
from the Seoul District Prosecutor’s Office.

56:28.429 --> 56:34.389
I have a warrant to collect all materials
here as evidence. Please cooperate.

57:06.449 --> 57:09.528
What's with the lighting?
It's so dim.

57:09.529 --> 57:11.438
We won't be able to see
the candidates' faces.

57:11.439 --> 57:14.459
Where's the lighting director,
the lighting director?

57:15.479 --> 57:17.278
Are you the lighting director?

57:17.279 --> 57:18.219
Yes.

57:18.249 --> 57:21.988
You should make the lights brighter,
much brighter.

57:21.989 --> 57:25.288
We won't be able to even see
the candidates' faces the way it is now.

57:25.289 --> 57:28.048
Focus and do it. Hurry up!

57:28.049 --> 57:32.619
We've been asked
to focus the lighting more please.

57:37.089 --> 57:39.018
Yeah, that's great.

57:39.019 --> 57:41.498
So bright and majestic.

57:41.499 --> 57:44.449
That's how it should be done.

57:44.759 --> 57:45.989
Continue.

59:17.219 --> 59:18.869
Wha... What?

59:19.339 --> 59:21.486
Great job, thanks.

59:24.179 --> 59:27.668
So they're planning to go all the way, huh?

59:27.669 --> 59:33.668
No. This is definitely a political attack.

59:33.769 --> 59:38.268
I have to win in order to clear my name.

59:38.269 --> 59:39.209
Yeah.

59:39.229 --> 59:42.378
Chairman Chang, thank you.

59:42.379 --> 59:46.558
Yes... Please take care of things
from behind the scenes.

59:46.559 --> 59:47.858
Yeah. Yeah.

59:47.859 --> 59:48.809
Thank you.

59:48.849 --> 59:50.029
Yes.

59:54.779 --> 59:58.429
They want to pull me down?

59:59.059 --> 01:00:02.909
Prosecutor Kim, that jerk...
Really.

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:15.538
The safety of the Republic of S. Korea
has never been as crucial as it is now.

01:00:15.939 --> 01:00:19.468
Right now,
the People's Army of North Korea

01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:23.308
may launch an attack on us
at any given place, at any given time.

01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:26.928
Currently...
Come in.

01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:32.909
Currently in North Korea...
I said come in.

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.889
We...

01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:38.129
Who is it?

01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:58.400
You just need to sleep a while,
Candidate Seo.

01:01:03.101 --> 01:01:04.701
This coffee is good.

01:01:05.689 --> 01:01:08.979
How long have you been working in
election broadcasting?

01:01:09.009 --> 01:01:11.208
The sound is so...

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.906
You should make it louder...

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:17.208
so we can hear
how trustworthy the candidates sound.

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:18.708
It's so soft, like the sound of an ant.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.248
Make it louder.

01:01:20.249 --> 01:01:22.068
I think it's okay.

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:23.658
What do you mean it's okay?

01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:28.558
You have to make it so that the candidates'
voices can be heard across the nation!

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:33.429
Hurry up and do it.
Hurry, louder.

01:01:34.579 --> 01:01:39.468
Your ID...
Who are you?

01:01:39.469 --> 01:01:43.148
Why is someone else's picture under yours?

01:01:43.149 --> 01:01:47.668
Where are you...?
What are you doing...?

01:01:47.669 --> 01:01:52.358
Do you think this looks like a fake?
Huh?

01:01:52.359 --> 01:01:58.288
Make the sound loud so that the candidates'
voices can be heard across the nation, okay?

01:01:58.889 --> 01:02:02.098
I'm going to go to the bathroom
so wait here.

01:02:02.099 --> 01:02:04.388
Louder, okay?

01:02:04.389 --> 01:02:07.869
And fix the lighting too.

01:02:09.469 --> 01:02:12.728
Isn't that guy suspicious?
There's another picture under his ID.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:13.518
I've never seen him before.

01:02:13.519 --> 01:02:14.568
Let's go. Let's go.

01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:17.608
Yes. I'm going right now
to pick up Candidate Seo.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:18.658
Yes.

01:02:18.959 --> 01:02:21.666
I know he'll be coming through Gate 2.

01:02:22.509 --> 01:02:23.719
Yes.

01:02:24.929 --> 01:02:29.468
Yoon... Yoon Sung. I think I got caught.
Hurry up and run.

01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:30.460
Hold it.

01:02:30.968 --> 01:02:32.400
- Hold it.
- Catch him.

01:02:32.694 --> 01:02:33.901
- Hey!
- Stop.

01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:37.729
Stop... Stop!

01:02:46.559 --> 01:02:50.189
Agent Kim, hurry and go.

01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:14.878
This is Candidate Seo's waiting room.
Candidate Seo has disappeared.

01:03:14.879 --> 01:03:18.479
Block all the exits and send more people.

01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:32.218
Hello, this is Prosecutor Kim...
What?

01:03:32.219 --> 01:03:34.968
Candidate Seo has been kidnapped?

01:03:34.969 --> 01:03:36.169
Okay.

01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:37.229
Na Na.

01:04:38.099 --> 01:04:39.309
Hello.

01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:50.738
Is it true
Candidate Seo has been kidnapped?

01:04:50.739 --> 01:04:53.348
Yes, I think he was kidnapped.

01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:56.238
We blocked all the exits
so he's definitely still inside.

01:04:56.239 --> 01:04:58.018
I'm going to search
from top to bottom.

01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.229
Fighting!

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:12.189
What's going on?

01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:15.722
The elevator has stopped.

01:05:36.679 --> 01:05:38.818
Then I'm going to go first
and find Candidate Seo.

01:05:38.819 --> 01:05:40.698
Be careful Na Na.
We'll be right behind.

01:05:40.699 --> 01:05:41.989
Okay.

01:06:23.189 --> 01:06:24.404
Stop right there!

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:34.209
Stop!

01:06:39.149 --> 01:06:42.839
I'm warning you...
Stop what you're doing!
