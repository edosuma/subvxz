account of your whereabouts

00:08.884 --> 00:11.353
throughout Friday
and into Friday evening?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.685
I was with my brother Ciaran,
in his shop.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.520
Move it, move it!

00:15.682 --> 00:16.433

She can't go ahead

Charlie said in his message

00:23.315 --> 00:25.363
that he'd found something
that changed everything.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.743

Do you think
it's a mammoth's tooth?

00:29.446 --> 00:31.744
Well, if it turns
out that's what it is...

00:31.907 --> 00:33.375
Please call me.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.751
And only me.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.878
Is this what got him killed?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.289
What have you done?

00:38.455 --> 00:39.752

06:21.131 --> 06:23.054
Put the rifle down now, Henry.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.187
Okay, Henry.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.063

Come on.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.111
It's okay.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.999
I thought I'd just heave
all this junk out into a skip

07:33.161 --> 07:35.289
and torch the lot.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.128
Yeah.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.588
Get rid of all
the evidence.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.968
My life.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.219

07:50.136 --> 07:51.228
Do the dirty work.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.890
That's what you do, isn't it?

07:53.056 --> 07:54.103

08:31.553 --> 08:35.399
Stop behaving like
a mad old bastard.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.231
I promise I will find
whoever killed Charlie.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.486
Keep your head down.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.443
No more public displays of rage.

08:43.606 --> 08:47.076
You said you didn't trust me
because I'm a drunk.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.038
I did.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.244
And maybe all of this...

08:55.410 --> 08:57.754
This is all my fault,
my fault you're drinking.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.414
Oh, no.

08:59.581 --> 09:03.677
No, I'm a drunk
for reasons all of my own.

09:03.835 --> 09:08.386
I shot a man in the head.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.391
I killed a man.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.894
No, Henry.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.930
That was my doing.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.894
My fault, my responsibility.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.650
So tell me how.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.194
I can't.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.941
<i>GPR stands for...?</i>

09:27.108 --> 09:28.360
<i>Ground Penetrating Radar.</i>

09:28.526 --> 09:31.325
<i>Okay, well, this
is progress, isn't it?</i>

09:31.488 --> 09:33.582
Yes, I guess.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.539
I mean, I found it
in Stoddart's study.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.123
He was looking
at the images himself,

09:38.286 --> 09:41.039
but the scan
has Pettigrew's name on it.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.879
And it's creased and folded

09:43.041 --> 09:44.964
as though it's been
passed around quite a bit.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.754
Well, I mean,
where does the map lead us?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.013
What did Pettigrew find?

09:49.172 --> 09:50.515
I don't know, Bernard.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.512
"Max 2.5."

09:55.678 --> 09:58.101
Somebody wrote that in here,
see that?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.562
We could be looking at
an oil field the size of Belgium

10:00.725 --> 10:04.150
or the size of that bed
over there, I don't know.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.564
Okay, Gene, I'll have
Tech Resources examine it.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.572
Okay.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.281
Jason said he was
with his brother last night,

10:14.447 --> 10:15.869
but we can't find Ciaran
to check that out.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.534
Eric tried here last night?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.919
Yes-- nothing.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.876
Jason doesn't have an alibi
unless we get hold of Ciaran,

10:22.038 --> 10:23.711
but Ciaran is nowhere.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.638
Call his mobile.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.684
It's ringing.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.596
Keep trying.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.278
His phone's inside.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.122
Ciaran?!

11:00.785 --> 11:02.287
Ciaran?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.594
Ciaran?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.178
Gel the lights.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.187
Call an ambulance.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.819
Oh, fuck.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.571
Medic and ambulance
needed straight away,

11:28.730 --> 11:30.152
Ciaran Donnelly's
camping shop.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.784
It was Ronnie!

11:32.942 --> 11:34.660
Ronnie Morgan.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.867
He came in here last night.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.954
Ronnie wanted a boat.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.499
Didn't have any money,
so I told him where to go.

11:47.665 --> 11:52.091
Wouldn't take no
for an answer, so I...

11:52.253 --> 11:57.350
I picked up a big fucking
Bowie knife off the display.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.010
He grabbed the blade, Dan.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.851
He grabbed the blade,

12:02.013 --> 12:04.357
twisted the knife
right out of my hand.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.440
Then he just laid into me.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.480
If he's taken a boat,
he could be anywhere.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.283
Ronnie's out of control.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.991
It was as if
he was possessed.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.603
Liam?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.477
Liam!

12:45.640 --> 12:47.642
You're all right, sweetheart,
I'm here.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.231
Liam!

12:49.394 --> 12:52.864
Help!

12:53.022 --> 12:54.114
I don't know what's happening.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.617
The doctor's on her way.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.072
Liam!

12:57.235 --> 12:58.862
It's all right, sweetheart,
I'm here, Liam.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.871
Do something!

13:22.635 --> 13:24.137
I'll check
round the back.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.895
<i>Carrie's rabbit's gone.</i>

13:28.057 --> 13:30.105
Why would she take
her rabbit?

13:30.268 --> 13:34.239
Companionship?

13:34.397 --> 13:35.944
Or maybe to make a casserole.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.360
Whoever killed the professor
must have been very strong.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.620
And very physically violent.

13:53.416 --> 13:57.592
Prescription pills
in Ronnie's name, unopened.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.051
What are they?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.636
800 mills Thanatolinone.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.346
You know the name.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.433
These are anti-psychotics.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.941
He's left home
without his med pills.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.275
We've had no trouble with
Ronnie since he arrived here.

14:15.438 --> 14:16.781
No, none at all,

14:16.939 --> 14:19.112
but if he's off
his medication...

14:19.275 --> 14:20.697
Then we have
no way of knowing

14:20.860 --> 14:22.612
the severity
of his condition.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.122
They don't prescribe
anti-psychotics

14:24.280 --> 14:25.782
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.916
Ciaran said that he grabbed
the knife by the blade.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.454
House to house.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.670
Anybody's seen them in the last
24 hours, we follow up.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.175
I'll get my gear.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.257
Frank and I will take
the launch up the coast.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.796
Track the stolen boat.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.054
No.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.300
I'll go with Frank.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.554
Dan, I'd rather help Frank
chase a murderer

14:48.721 --> 14:51.440
than drag my sore leg
around town all day.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.691
Get busy.

15:03.403 --> 15:07.704
I've got the coordinates
of Ronnie's boat from his GPS.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.539
He's about seven miles
up the coast.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.499
I can easily follow his route
since he left Fortitude Harbor.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.587
And this.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.342
This is odd.

15:21.337 --> 15:26.468
He sailed 30 miles northwest,
then he sailed all the way back.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.064
No sign of Carrie at home
or at school?

15:32.223 --> 15:33.600
Ronnie must have her
with him.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.019
The longer she's alone with him,
the more she's at risk.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.778
We gotta go right now.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.704
Liam had a fit
this morning.

15:46.863 --> 15:47.785
He couldn't breathe.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.948
What kind of fit,
is he all right?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.332
You have to go
and see him.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.040
It's not right, Frank,
what's happening to him,

15:53.202 --> 15:55.079
and they won't listen to me.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.338
He's asleep now.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.589
Just go and see him, Frank.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.000
I'm sorry, Jules.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.259
I need Frank.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.294
Yeah?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.680
Well, his son
needs him more.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.011
Go and see him, Frank!

16:15.183 --> 16:17.151
<i>What's going on with you two?</i>

16:17.310 --> 16:19.187
<i>I've moved out of the house.</i>

16:19.353 --> 16:21.856
<i>Into the hotel?</i>

16:22.023 --> 16:24.697
<i>I'm not talking
about this just now.</i>

16:24.859 --> 16:26.611
<i>While your son is sick?</i>

16:26.777 --> 16:28.450
<i>There's nothing I can
do about that, is there?</i>

16:28.613 --> 16:30.741
<i>Just concentrate
on your job, Frank.</i>

16:30.907 --> 16:32.454
<i>I need you to do that.</i>

17:04.815 --> 17:08.035
The GPR scan that you gave
to the professor.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.741
Yes.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.622
Morton has the scan.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.876
He found it in the professor's
house and he took it.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.333
Who's Morton?

17:18.496 --> 17:20.464
The British policeman.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.717
He has the scan.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.923
Do you understand?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.178
I'm sorry.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.055
I don't care
if you're sorry, Max.

17:28.214 --> 17:28.931
I don't...

17:38.099 --> 17:39.942
This little girl here
is missing.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.989
Either of you seen her
in the last 36 hours?

17:45.147 --> 17:46.239
Missing?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.153
No?

17:50.319 --> 17:52.071
Me, neither.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.740
Sorry, officer,
I'd love to help.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.913
You mind telling me
your name, sir?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.966
Sorry, officer,
my friend's Russian.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.798
He doesn't speak English.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.338
So you speak Russian?

18:08.504 --> 18:09.596
I'm afraid not.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.133
Then how can he
be your friend

18:12.300 --> 18:13.893
when you can't speak
to each other?

18:15.636 --> 18:17.104
He's not really my friend.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.015
He just gave me a lift here.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.275
Out.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.074
He gave you a lift here,
here you are.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.324
Out you get.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.456
Do I know you?

19:01.015 --> 19:02.141
Dickless asshole.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.706
<i>This bear was in a fight.</i>

19:24.622 --> 19:26.875
Who are you?

19:27.041 --> 19:29.635
You know who I am, Henry.

19:29.794 --> 19:33.344
You spoke to my colleague,
DI Littlejohn,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.600
at the Pettigrew inquest.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.516
You remember?

19:42.390 --> 19:44.518
I am the inevitable
consequence.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.028
Did you take this one too?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.658
Yeah.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.660
I took them all
with my little camera.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.494
How close do you have to be
to take something like that?

19:58.656 --> 20:01.455
Little camera,
very long lens.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.008
They're very big,
polar bears.

20:09.166 --> 20:15.139
Well, largest carnivore
on the surface of God's earth,

20:15.297 --> 20:16.389
they are.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.307
So Pettigrew...

20:20.469 --> 20:21.721
What about him?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.184
Wandered out of town.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.190
Apparently so, yeah.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.566
Eaten by a bear.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.774
Terrible bad luck, there.

20:28.936 --> 20:33.282
You'd think he would have been
fully cognizant of the risks.

20:33.441 --> 20:37.617
Apparently, he liked a drink.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.952
Do you have any idea
what he was looking for up here,

20:41.115 --> 20:42.833
or what he might have found,
even?

20:42.992 --> 20:45.370
None whatsoever.

20:45.536 --> 20:48.790
You were good friends
with Professor Stoddart?

20:48.956 --> 20:51.550
Well, yes--
good friends.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.757
Do you think their deaths
are connected in any way?

20:53.919 --> 20:55.011
No, I don't.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.263
You don't?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.766
No.

20:58.924 --> 21:03.395
You know when they say,
"Your call may be recorded?"

21:03.554 --> 21:08.230
What they mean is,
"Your call is being recorded."

21:08.392 --> 21:12.022
<i>Billy
Pettigrew wasn't eaten by a bear.</i>

21:12.188 --> 21:14.156
<i>He was murdered.</i>

21:14.315 --> 21:17.319
<i>Now Professor Charlie Stoddart
has been murdered as well.</i>

21:17.485 --> 21:20.238
<i>The Governor is responsible.</i>

21:20.404 --> 21:23.248
<i>Her sheriff killed them both.</i>

21:30.498 --> 21:31.750
I can fly you to London

21:31.916 --> 21:33.384
and I can guarantee
you protection.

21:39.590 --> 21:40.842
No point in that.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.305
Why not?

21:42.468 --> 21:45.472
That's not my voice.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.000
Dan, can you pass me
the GPS?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.089
Dan?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.137
Dan?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.962
So you'd rather stay here

22:56.125 --> 22:58.048
than stay with Eric and me
just now?

23:03.173 --> 23:06.017
Well, the service
is definitely better.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.602
I need to go home.

23:10.764 --> 23:11.856
Okay.

23:15.019 --> 23:17.488
The next flight's on Thursday.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.819
I've booked a seat.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.201
I need to be alone.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.990
Okay, I understand.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.248
My theory is

23:28.407 --> 23:29.909
that somebody
a long time ago in Fortitude

23:30.075 --> 23:33.670
came across a bag of gravel

23:33.829 --> 23:37.550
and they mistook it
for a sack of coffee beans.

23:37.708 --> 23:41.133
The gravel habit stuck.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.467
Would anyone like one?

23:42.630 --> 23:44.177
Not for me.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.637
I've got things to do.

23:45.799 --> 23:46.641
Excuse me.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.768
You're good friends, huh?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.309
Yes, since she married
Charlie.

23:54.475 --> 23:55.522
How is she doing?

23:55.684 --> 23:57.527
Not good.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.529
Hardly surprising.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.113
She moved out
of your house?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.242
Yes.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.654
Hardly surprising.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.740
Really?

24:09.907 --> 24:11.454
Yeah.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.915
She thinks you killed
her husband.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.172
What?

24:21.335 --> 24:25.511
She has a theory that Charlie
was going to deny you permission

24:25.673 --> 24:31.521
for your Glacier hotel,
and that you had him killed.

24:31.679 --> 24:34.774
He didn't deny us
permission.

24:34.932 --> 24:38.152
No, I know, but he was going
to change his report.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.654
And he left a message
saying that on her phone,

24:40.813 --> 24:44.238
a message which she believes
you deleted.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.323
This is really
what she thinks?

24:52.116 --> 24:53.333
Yes.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.211
And what do you think?

24:56.370 --> 24:58.372
Well, I asked myself,

24:58.539 --> 25:01.213
what scenario's more likely?

25:01.375 --> 25:05.380
A conspiracy involving
a governor and a sheriff

25:05.546 --> 25:08.265
and a very lucrative
glacier hotel,

25:08.424 --> 25:11.223
or some poor bastard
off his meds

25:11.385 --> 25:14.389
has a psychotic episode
in a stranger's house?

25:19.143 --> 25:20.019
And?

25:20.185 --> 25:22.438
And...

25:24.648 --> 25:26.571
50/50.

26:14.823 --> 26:18.327
Carrie never said
anything at all about her dad

26:18.494 --> 26:22.465
or how things were
at home recently?

26:22.623 --> 26:24.921
I wish I could tell you
something, but no.

26:28.253 --> 26:32.633
She seemed happy
while she was around here?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.268
Yeah, always.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.522
So, one minute
you're in Afghanistan,

26:42.684 --> 26:44.231
the next
you're in the Arctic?

26:44.394 --> 26:45.486
Must be tough.

26:45.646 --> 26:47.273
Bit of a culture shock.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.157
I wasn't in Afghanistan.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.863
Oh.

26:51.026 --> 26:55.327
I was in family quarters
at RAF Odiham in the UK

26:55.489 --> 26:57.457
while Frank was
in Afghanistan.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.833
For long?

26:58.992 --> 27:01.120
Four years, maybe five.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.084
You hardly saw him.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.339
No.

27:07.251 --> 27:08.377
That's tough.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.467
Me and the Governor
haven't been apart

27:10.629 --> 27:11.721
since we were married.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.052
You're married
to the Governor?

27:13.215 --> 27:14.341
Yeah.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.058
She won't let me leave.

27:19.221 --> 27:23.146
She can't do anything
without running it past me.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.151
Utterly dependent.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.062
I am the real power
behind the throne.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.448
Hildy is simply my stooge,
you know?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.493
Never tell her this.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.700
The truth might kill her.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.853
♪♪

28:58.445 --> 29:01.244
Ronnie Morgan?

29:01.406 --> 29:05.252
This is Sheriff Anderssen,
Fortitude police.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.253
Ronnie, can you hear me?

29:08.455 --> 29:11.459
I need you to show yourself,
Ronnie!

29:14.086 --> 29:17.636
Okay, Ronnie, we're going
to have to come aboard!

29:19.424 --> 29:20.846
<i>You were teaching her to swim.</i>

29:21.009 --> 29:22.101
<i>Who?</i>

29:22.261 --> 29:23.308
Carrie Morgan.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.642
She's gone missing.

29:24.805 --> 29:25.977
With her dad.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.561
Ronnie?

29:27.724 --> 29:28.600
Yeah.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.814
You know she's
best friends

29:29.977 --> 29:31.069
with the little boy Liam?

29:31.228 --> 29:32.480
Yeah.

29:32.646 --> 29:35.069
I think Frank Sutter is the man
they should be looking at.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.075
He is violent and unstable.

29:37.234 --> 29:38.861
His son is in the hospital

29:39.027 --> 29:41.906
and now Carrie is missing
from her home.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.033
Thank you.

29:46.535 --> 29:49.209
Sutter was in Afghanistan,
you know.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.499
Terrible things
happen there.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.713
Terrible things
happen everywhere.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.501
Yeah, of course
they do, but...

29:54.668 --> 29:56.261
Terrible things happen here.

30:08.765 --> 30:09.982
How is that burger?

30:10.142 --> 30:11.234
Delicious.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.371
Dan back?

30:23.530 --> 30:24.281
No.

30:24.448 --> 30:25.449
Shit.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.663
You smell of very strong
perfume.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.710
I found this
at Frank Sutter's house.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.591
Frank Sutter's?

30:34.750 --> 30:35.592
Oh, my God.

30:35.751 --> 30:36.593
Whose blood is it?

30:36.752 --> 30:37.924
We have to tell Dan.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.088
Test the blood,
see if it's animal or human.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.178
I'll try to get ahold of Dan.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.862
Ronnie!

31:03.028 --> 31:05.907
It's Sheriff Anderssen!

31:30.722 --> 31:31.939
Fuck!

31:33.475 --> 31:35.227
Dan?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.738
Dan, you all right?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.022
Dan?

31:41.108 --> 31:43.907
Scared the fucking life
out of me.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.506
Come on.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.971
How are you gonna get the money
for the tickets to Norway

32:07.134 --> 32:09.432
if you can't get
in the house?

32:09.594 --> 32:12.268
I'm going to bring them
something we can sell.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.728
What?

32:13.890 --> 32:14.982
It's a surprise.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.234
Come on.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.385
The dogs'll look out for you.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.680
They're fierce dogs,
huskies.

32:52.846 --> 32:55.565
But only when it comes
to bears.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.522
A husky will never, ever
attack a man.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.611
Oh, it's a wood burner.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.366
You'll be fine here.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.081
Can't I come with you?

33:14.451 --> 33:17.421
No, they'll be looking for a man
and a little girl.

33:20.749 --> 33:21.966
I'm scared, Dad.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.213
Make us some dinner.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.882
It'll warm me up
when I get back.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.686
<i>I'll be back soon,</i>

33:33.845 --> 33:36.064
<i>and I'm going to bring you
something marvelous.</i>

33:50.862 --> 33:51.954
Natalie?

33:52.113 --> 33:53.239
They let me go.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.703
No charges.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.369
No connection to the professor's
death whatsoever.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.913
I was with my brother
in his shop when it happened

33:59.079 --> 34:00.331
right up till me and you left.

34:00.497 --> 34:01.840
Your brother was attacked
by Ronnie Morgan.

34:01.998 --> 34:02.920
That's right.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.006
So they think it's him?

34:05.168 --> 34:06.260
Yep.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.469
What're you doing with that?

34:13.426 --> 34:15.303
Yeah, I've been asked
to analyze this

34:15.469 --> 34:18.143
by the governor and DCI Morton.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.148
Oh.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.399
Right.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.195
And?

34:25.772 --> 34:27.069
It's a mammoth's tooth.

34:27.232 --> 34:28.574
Is that right?

34:28.733 --> 34:32.737
Radio carbon dating puts it
at 32,000 years old.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.453
So where'd you get it?

34:36.616 --> 34:38.835
You mean is there more
than just a tooth?

34:38.994 --> 34:41.167
Is there?

34:41.329 --> 34:44.378
What would it be worth to you
if there was, Natalie?

34:44.541 --> 34:47.135
So where's the rest of it?

34:47.293 --> 34:48.295
Who are you?

34:48.460 --> 34:51.179
Vincent Rattrey,
post-doctorate researcher.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.636
Badger Boy!

34:53.675 --> 34:54.641
This is Badger Boy.

34:54.801 --> 34:55.893
Animal remains like this

34:56.052 --> 34:57.349
are required by law
to be surrendered

34:57.512 --> 34:58.889
into the care
of the Research Institute

34:59.055 --> 35:00.648
for study and archiving.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.808
Only if they're from here.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.067
Obviously.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.819
If this was genuinely
from here,

35:04.978 --> 35:06.525
it would be
an astonishing discovery

35:06.688 --> 35:08.690
and you'd be required
to surrender the remains to us.

35:08.857 --> 35:09.779
Surrender them?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.033
That's right.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.910

my uncle's house 20 years ago.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.181
He was in the merchant navy.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.146
Sailed the world

you took Charlie's report.

Yes.

It was commissioned
by the government

36:05.205 --> 36:07.333
and it recommends that we
proceed with the development,
