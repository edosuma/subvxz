WEBVTT

00:40.707 --> 00:42.808
I think he went this way!
Come on!

00:51.718 --> 00:54.718
Looks like Smith weaseled out
of gym class again, Dad.

00:54.821 --> 00:57.821
I told you. Here at school,
you call me Coach, dip wad!

00:58.191 --> 01:01.191
Where did those dogs come from?

01:06.699 --> 01:09.068
You ditching gym class too?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.236
Today is track.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.405
I hate running.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.406
Then we're on the same page.
Welcome to my sanctuary.

01:16.443 --> 01:19.443
Look at them,
scurrying around like ants.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.914
Go ahead
Overexercise all you want.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.915
You'll never escape the smoky death
of time's magnifying glass.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.387
Wow, that's a little dark.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.589
Not at all.
Life is a banquet.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.590
- And death is dessert.
- I love dessert!

01:34.294 --> 01:37.294
Mm.

01:38.798 --> 01:40.799
That's one
impressive man.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.801
Handsome, fit,
the whole package.

01:42.802 --> 01:45.802
That's great, Stan. can't we stop staring
at your reflection in the TV...

01:45.872 --> 01:47.873
and actually
turn it on now?

01:47.874 --> 01:50.309
I promised my
Mr. Belvedere chat group...

01:50.310 --> 01:52.611
I'd post a summary
of this episode by 6:00.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.613
Those losers
are pretty punctual.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.516
Good news, everyone.
I'm in love.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.085
- Tell us about her, sweetie.
- Her name is Debbie.

02:00.086 --> 02:03.086
She smells like a glue stick,
she shares my interest in bug zappers...

02:03.823 --> 02:06.758
and she likes reading old books
by guys who died of syphilis.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.758
Syphilis!
Ooh, la, la!

02:09.829 --> 02:11.830
Great.
Thanks to your gassing on...

02:11.831 --> 02:14.831
I completely missed why Mr. Belvedere
is stomping on his hat.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.436
The Internet is not
going to be happy.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.671
So, what's this Debbie's
affiliation?

02:19.672 --> 02:21.707
varsity cheerleader
or regular cheerleader?

02:21.708 --> 02:23.709
Actually, she's more
fan artist.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.512
She played Lady Macbeth in our
school production of Oklahoma.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.514
Frankly, it was a mess...

02:28.515 --> 02:31.083
but our drama teacher finally
got sober, thank God.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.085
So she's an actress.
Attaboy!

02:33.086 --> 02:35.187
My son is dating
a hot actress.

02:35.188 --> 02:38.188
I guess. But mostly I like her because
she's so unusual and fascinating.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.793
Of course she's fascinating.
She's gorgeous.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.529
You know,
I hear she's an actress.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.231
And this girl actually wants
to spend time with you?

02:46.232 --> 02:49.067
For your information,
she said she thinks I'm cute.

02:49.068 --> 02:52.068
So she lies. Great. That's how you know
she doesn't, have a penis.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.338
- We can't wait to meet her, Steve.
- You can say that again.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.575
It'll be nice to have a pretty girl
around the house for a change.

02:59.145 --> 03:02.114
I- I meant,
a pretty younger girl.

03:02.115 --> 03:05.115
Don, get mad at me.
It's called makeup.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.355
Dad, I have a confession
about Debbie.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.025
I haven, actually
asked her out yet.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.026
Oh, thank God. I thought you were
gonna tell me she isn't, a cheerleader.

03:16.229 --> 03:19.229
The thing is, I really like Debbie,
but I keep chickening out.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.500
Steve, I'm going to
motivate you...

03:21.501 --> 03:24.102
the same way the C.I.A.
motivates its assassins...

03:24.103 --> 03:27.005
you know, when they have
trouble asking out a girl.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.541
There. If you don,
ask Debbie out in 24 hours...

03:29.542 --> 03:31.944
the collar will sense
your stress level and blow up.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.912
Blow up?

03:33.913 --> 03:36.548
Whoops. I accidentally
set it for 24 minutes.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.550
Oh, man, you better run!

03:38.551 --> 03:40.852
Gotta get to Debbie's house.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.193
Oh, boy!
The circus is coming to town.

03:48.194 --> 03:51.194
And I'm gonna die!

03:51.297 --> 03:53.932
Okay, according
to my Timex watch...

03:53.933 --> 03:56.933
I still have
five minutes left.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.347
Steve, what are you
doing here?

04:08.348 --> 04:11.348
Oh, um, I, um-

04:20.459 --> 04:23.460
I'm so glad you asked me out.
This is my favorite spot.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.731
It's so romantic.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.732
Why did he have to die?

04:28.835 --> 04:31.835
It sucks we put our dead in the earth
where we can, watch them decompose.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.438
You know, putrefaction is simply
a community of necrophores...

04:36.709 --> 04:39.709
that engorge the carrion
with sulfur dioxide gas.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.313
All this talk of death
is making me cremate.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.956
Mom, Debbie's gonna
be here any minute.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.592
- Dinner's almost done.
- I hope you like her, Dad.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.528
Of course I'll like her.
After all, she's your girlfriend.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.630
One day, she might even
take the Smith name.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.632
What a wedding it will be.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.934
Purple napkins,
a make-your-own-crepe station...

05:02.935 --> 05:05.437
and a touching speech, in which
I reminisce about the time...

05:05.438 --> 05:07.606
I dropped you on your head
as an infant.

05:07.607 --> 05:10.542
And then someone in the crowd yells out,
',hat explains a lot....

05:10.543 --> 05:13.543
- And we all share a laugh.
- Here she comes.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.947
- Where's Debbie? Behind that fat girl?
- No, Dad, that's-

05:18.284 --> 05:20.952
- Is the fat girl going to lead us to Debbie?
- No, that's-

05:20.953 --> 05:23.953
She's carrying a purse. She must have
a map to Debbie in her purse.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.990
- Dad, that's Debbie.
- To the panic room!

05:30.596 --> 05:33.596
Stan, you're being ridiculous.
We have a guest out there.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.966
Please, Francine, show some panic.
Our son is dating a fatty.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.003
Dad, that's awful.
Plus-size women drive our economy...

05:40.573 --> 05:43.275
with their purchases
of Garfield books and HÃ¤agen-Dazs.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.277
You apologize
to your son.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.446
For what?
You brought fat into our house.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.815
You'd like Debbie
if you got to know her, Dad.

05:49.816 --> 05:52.816
- There's a lot more to her than you think.
- There's more of her?

05:53.386 --> 05:56.386
So, what are we panicking about?
Is there another new pope?

05:56.723 --> 05:58.724
Damn it, Roger!
Lock the door!

05:58.725 --> 06:01.725
Hello? Anyone home?

06:01.994 --> 06:04.229
She smells people food.
Don, worry.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.230
She'll probably just rummage around
in the refrigerator and then retreat back to her lair.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.834
My stars! Who is that enchanting
Rubenesque vision?

06:11.871 --> 06:14.871
She's like a female Mr. Belvedere.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.510
Hmm.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.511
- I'm going, after her.
- I forbid you to see that girl.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.316
You can't keep us apart.
Debbie!

06:24.317 --> 06:26.318
How can you be so cruel?

06:26.319 --> 06:29.187
Do you want your grandchildren
to be half fat, Francine? Is that it?

06:29.188 --> 06:31.189
Who are you to judge
someone's weight?

06:31.190 --> 06:34.190
Ja your suit is stuffed
tighter than, um...

06:34.293 --> 06:36.361
some funny German word.

06:36.362 --> 06:39.264
Ach sorry.
I'm kinda running out offish shtick.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.299
Oh! And just like that, I'm back!

06:41.300 --> 06:43.568
You people are crazy.
I'm in great shape.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.837
They're right, Stan.
You've let yourself go.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.838
What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.713
Good God, it's true!

06:54.714 --> 06:57.714
I've become one of them.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.627
- Ready for some pancakes, Hayley?
- Thanks, Mom.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.628
- How about you, Stan?
- Not on my diet. Just some OJ.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.568
Where's Steve?
Still caught in Debbie's gravitational pull?

07:18.805 --> 07:21.805
That's so unfair, Dad.
Overweight people have it hard enough...

07:21.908 --> 07:24.908
being disgusting without
you making fun of them.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.346
God, look at me.
I'm hideous.

07:28.347 --> 07:31.347
Stan, you've been working out
for three weeks. You look great.

07:31.717 --> 07:34.717
Great as in great big fatso.
You know, this is how it starts, Francine.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.156
First you go soft in the belly.
Then you go soft in defense.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.625
Next thing you know, you're
wearing a towel on your head...

07:40.626 --> 07:42.627
and using your left hand
for toilet paper.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.628
Well, not in my America.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.868
Hey bro. I couldn't,help noticing
you're kinda fat and pathetic.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.973
And you're kinda perfect and scrumptious.
What's your point?

07:54.974 --> 07:57.142
Name's Zack.
I'm a personal trainer.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.444
I wear a trucker cap,
and I can mold you...

07:59.445 --> 08:01.680
into a dude who won,
send the ladies puking.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.149
I'll do anything to look like you.
When can we start?

08:04.150 --> 08:07.150
Don, waste time asking questions
when you should be rocking, it.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.588
Exercise is everywhere.
See those kids?

08:09.589 --> 08:12.023
Potential barbells.
Now rock me two "hundy...!

08:14.026 --> 08:17.026
Shut up and help me count!

08:18.564 --> 08:21.564
Here he comes. Remember,
we have to do whatever we can...

08:21.567 --> 08:24.336
to get him to eat as much as possible.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.905
Oh, Zack really kicked my ass
at the gym today.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.906
That was one exhausting workout.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.909
Oop! Time for my workout.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.925
You are freaking me out!
Sit down and eat!

08:46.926 --> 08:49.926
No can do.
Somehow I've gotten even heavier.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.963
Until these pounds
start coming off...

08:51.964 --> 08:54.399
I need to stick to the Z-man's plan.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.968
Stop it.
You're not fat.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.969
- Now come on. I made your favorite, pot roast.
- Get that away from me!

09:00.673 --> 09:03.673
Die, calories! Die!

09:14.153 --> 09:17.153
You sunk my battleship.
800 souls were lost.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.294
Among them,
Lieutenant Don Sharp.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.063
He made it through the bulkhead
before it was closed.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.432
At least, half of him did.

09:27.433 --> 09:30.068
- God, you're tweaked.
- Take me.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.072
Yeah, mmm.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.210
Oh, my Debbie.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.680
That should be me
handling your folds...

09:41.681 --> 09:44.316
and squeezing your
exquisite back fat.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.317
Buyout don, know you're
cheating on me yet, so I forgive you.

09:54.694 --> 09:57.694
1,001, 1,002, 1,003-

09:57.997 --> 10:00.365
Whoa there,jumpy.
I call you "jumpy... ironically...

10:00.366 --> 10:02.367
because you suck
at jumping rope.

10:02.368 --> 10:05.368
Just like I call fat people ',iny....
So start over,jumpy tiny.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.938
- Z-man, how'd you find where I live?
- Hey, you're my client.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.277
Now let's rock it up a bump,
"Chunky... Brewster.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.278
What am I doing wrong?
No matter what I do, I keep gaining weight.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.182
- Dude, it's your family. They're sabotaging you.
- What are you talking about?

10:19.652 --> 10:22.652
You said they were all farked at you
for dissing, your son's fat girlfriend.

10:24.023 --> 10:27.023
They-They want me
to get fat like that girl...

10:27.193 --> 10:29.260
so I'll apologize to Steve.

10:29.261 --> 10:32.261
Hells, yeah.
Now drop and give me a thousand!

10:34.300 --> 10:37.300
Oh, yeah!
Details published part of my letter.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.738
No, Hayley. No, put it over here.

10:39.739 --> 10:42.240
Come on.
It's fine. It's fine, Mom. Just do it. Go.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.242
Stan!
You startled us.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.778
- What are you doing to my celery?
- Nothing.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.779
- We're just freezing our-
- Tampons.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.883
- What?
- It's a woman thing.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.885
Keeps them crisp.
Great in the summer.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.920
More refreshing
than a Popsicle.

10:55.921 --> 10:58.921
Liars! You were sabotaging my veggies
to keep me fat.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.225
Dad, you're not fat.
Besides, how could we sabotage your veggies?

11:03.262 --> 11:06.262
Oh, your diet is
making you paranoid, Stan.

11:06.766 --> 11:09.766
I'm watching you two.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.740
Whew, that was close.
Hand me the syringe of lard.

11:18.444 --> 11:21.444
This'll fatten him up.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.517
This latest billion-dollar obstacle course...

11:25.518 --> 11:28.186
has been designed to push
each of you to the limit.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.187
You'll be climbing a net,
slinking through tires...

11:31.590 --> 11:34.590
and, most dangerous ofall,
climbing another net.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.594
Of course, none of this should
be any problem for a fit agent.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.838
Oh, look. Miss Pinkerton
fainted at the market...

11:48.974 --> 11:50.975
buying canned salmon
for her puss-puss.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.977
Get up, Smith!

11:52.978 --> 11:55.978
I have no choice but to suspend you
until you deal with your weight problem.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.289
I hope all you blubber-loving
Judases are happy.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.891
I just got suspended because
I'm in such bad shape.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.260
Well, maybe now
you'll listen to us.

12:09.261 --> 12:12.261
- You've become a man obsessed.
- We're all so worried about you.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.900
We have Grey's Anatomy
on Season Pass, yes?

12:15.901 --> 12:18.136
Yes.

12:18.137 --> 12:21.137
I was just fine until you all decided
to teach me a lesson by scheming against me.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.876
Now even my boss says
I have a weight problem.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.178
You do have a weight problem!

12:27.179 --> 12:29.280
But it's not that
you're too fat.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.281
Dad, we've done some research,
and we think you're anorexic.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.685
- What?
- You keep thinking you're fat no matter how skinny you get.

12:36.622 --> 12:39.357
That's ridiculous.
Look at me.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.960
It's worse than we thought.

12:41.961 --> 12:44.796
I know.
I'm a huge tub of lard.

12:44.797 --> 12:47.797
No, you earn't,.
You're just suffering from a delusional state.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.002
Delusional?
I'm not delusional.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.171
- Tell,em, Zack.
- Bro, don, listen to them.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.172
Stan, there's no one there.
Who are you talking to?

12:57.476 --> 13:00.476
Z- man, this is Francine,
Steve, my daughter, Hayley.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.113
I know, I know.
But she won, wear makeup.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.418
No!I don't,have a weight problem!

13:09.522 --> 13:12.522
- You can't make me go in there!
- You're sick, and you need help.

13:12.925 --> 13:14.959
And you're
uncommonly strong.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.629
So then I said,
"What the hell. I'm on vacation....

13:17.630 --> 13:19.664
And I had
a second tic tac.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.665
You can totally tell.
Look at her massive tic tac thighs.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.538
- Eating disorders are no laughing matter, young lady.
- Young lady?

13:29.074 --> 13:32.074
Now, now. I-I know in high school,
in the showers with the other girls...

13:32.178 --> 13:34.179
you feel uncomfortable
with your body.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.848
- I'm not in high school.
- When was the last time you menstruated?

13:36.849 --> 13:39.849
- I've never menstruated!
- Hear that, girls? Cautionary tale.

13:40.085 --> 13:43.085
Anorexia will dry up your ovaries
like tobacco in the sun.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.057
Now, instead of starving
yourselves...

13:46.058 --> 13:48.793
let's discuss healthier ways
to get back at Daddy.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.795
Like marrying a black dude.

13:50.796 --> 13:53.796
- Living with an anorexic can be a real challenge.
- How did this happen?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.834
Well, when young girls like
your father get this disease...

13:58.137 --> 14:00.638
it's usually the result
ofajarring event.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.874
Was he recently cut
from the cheer leading squad?

14:02.875 --> 14:05.443
No.

14:05.444 --> 14:08.444
- Has there been a change at home?
- A change at home?

14:08.948 --> 14:11.482
You brought fat into our house!

14:11.483 --> 14:14.185
I shouldn, be here,
veronica.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.521
Yeah, butyour family
will keep sending you back...

14:16.522 --> 14:18.690
until they think
you're "getting better....

14:18.691 --> 14:21.125
But I don, wanna eat.
I hate food.

14:21.126 --> 14:24.126
Don, sweat it.
I've got a few tricks I can teach you.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.166
That's been
in there for days.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.737
No, no, Debbie. This breakup has nothing
to do with my dad at all.

14:36.075 --> 14:39.075
It's just, you know, this is
a really bad time for me.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.880
The Ghost busters
box set just came out.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.282
What with that
and the new Doom being released...

14:44.283 --> 14:47.283
I just don, think I can
give you the time you need.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.787
Forget me,
big, beautiful creature!

14:55.895 --> 14:58.895
The girl who loves to go
to the market is now back on it.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.833
Soon she'll be mine.
Debbie!

15:03.836 --> 15:06.836
Oh! Whose foot is that?
Paddington Bear, you randy bastard.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.477
Mmm.

15:12.478 --> 15:15.478
- Stan, you're eating so well.
- Let's just say I learned a lot from my new friend veronica.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.751
You just keep focusing
on getting better, Dad.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.752
And you'll be glad to know
Debbie won, be around to upset you anymore.

15:23.188 --> 15:26.188
- What do you mean, Steve?
- We... went our separate ways!

15:29.895 --> 15:31.996
It's good to see
he's finally happy.

15:31.997 --> 15:34.997
Well, I'm stuffed. I'm gonna take a walk
and digest this nutritious repast.

15:48.414 --> 15:51.414
Thank you, veronica,
you fat bitch.

16:19.378 --> 16:22.378
Good-bye, Debbie. I'm getting rid
of everything that reminds me of you...

16:22.748 --> 16:25.748
and sealing it in this beautiful
hope chest you made me.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.053
- How you doin... Dad?
- Fat and healthy, Son.

16:29.054 --> 16:31.389
In a few weeks,
I'll be a regular Debbie.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.826
Steve, what's wrong?
What about the word "regular... set you off?

16:37.262 --> 16:39.263
Here, have a Little Debbie.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.265
What, now it's
the word "little...?

16:41.266 --> 16:43.601
You know what?
Why don, I put on some Debbie Gibson...

16:43.602 --> 16:46.602
and we can't talk about it?

16:47.439 --> 16:50.439
I'm glad you're better, Dad,
but I miss Debbie.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.010
Oh, is that what this is about?
Look, you're better off.

16:54.079 --> 16:57.079
- In fact, I've got a hot friend I wanna set you up with.
- I don, know, Dad.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.017
Come on. She's a cheerleader.
And a real one, not one of those fat jobs...

17:01.453 --> 17:04.453
whose mother has to sue
to get them on the team.

17:05.891 --> 17:08.192
Okay, so we'll split the olive.
You have the radish.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.194
I'll have some of that
decorative parsley.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.563
- And we'll both suck on ice chips for dessert.
- Great.

17:12.564 --> 17:15.564
I'm gonna walk past the Strongman
and sniff it a little.

17:16.268 --> 17:19.268
What'd I tell you, huh?
Look at her. She's the picture of health.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.977
Thanks for letting me
interview you...

17:25.978 --> 17:28.646
- for the Anne Rice fan club newsletter.
- Oh, no problem.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.648
- How did you get my number again?
- Huh?

17:30.649 --> 17:32.650
Oh, from your high school
principal.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.986
Yeah, huge Anne Rice fan.
Total 'mo.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.789
Hi. Uh, reservations
for two under "Roget....

17:37.790 --> 17:40.790
- We don, take reservations.
- Excellent.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.763
Ofall the buffets,
Steve's at this one?

17:48.967 --> 17:51.035
Here we are.
Oh, lucky you.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.371
You got a perfect view
of the busboy station.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.440
Dinner and a show.
Thank you, Sherry.

17:55.441 --> 17:58.441
- My name is Helen.
- Excellent.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.417
Whoa!

18:08.520 --> 18:11.520
Whoa!

18:26.004 --> 18:29.004
What's happening?

18:30.509 --> 18:33.509
He never cleaned his plate.
He just moved the food.

18:34.079 --> 18:37.079
He just moved the food.

18:37.082 --> 18:39.083
Why?

18:39.084 --> 18:42.084
Why?

18:44.756 --> 18:47.756
- I like your face.
- Oh. I thought we were here so you could interview me.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.395
I am. I am.
So, question one-

18:51.396 --> 18:54.396
- On a scale of zero to Lestat, how cute am I?
- What?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Speaking, of back rubs, you look like
you could use a rub-a-dub-dub.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.039
It's okay. I'm a licensed
chiropractor or something.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.108
Look, my boyfriend and I
just broke up...

19:04.109 --> 19:07.109
but I'm still kinda holding out hope
that we'll get back together.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.447
Oh.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.553
- You know, why don, we switch seats, huh?
- Oh!

19:15.554 --> 19:18.554
Chinese fire drill!
Ah, we're having, fun.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.591
Hmm?

19:20.592 --> 19:23.261
Oh, my God.
That's my ex-boyfriend.

19:23.262 --> 19:26.262
- I can't believe he's moved on.
- You know what would teach him a lesson?

19:26.865 --> 19:28.866
If he saw me and you
making, out.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.102
I don, know.
He's not even looking.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.304
- Excellent.
- Stan Smith!

19:33.305 --> 19:35.473
We found your
food graveyard.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.942
You haven, been getting better at all.

19:37.943 --> 19:40.943
What? I broke up with Debbie
,cause I thought it would help you.

19:41.079 --> 19:43.080
And you wreen't, even trying?

19:43.081 --> 19:46.017
Guys, I can explain.
I was lying to you.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.419
Debbie was the best thing
that ever happened to me...

19:48.420 --> 19:51.420
and you drove her away because of your
stupid obsession with how people look.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.823
I had a real connection with someone
for the first time in my life...

19:54.993 --> 19:57.261
and all you cared about
was her appearance.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.697
I don, care
if she was fat or thin.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.698
She was sweet and beautiful
and kinda freaky in a good way.

20:03.268 --> 20:06.268
And I'm gonna check every buffet
in town until I find her.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.273
- You don,have to, Steve.
- Debbie!

20:09.274 --> 20:12.274
- You had me at lasagna.
- I never said lasagna.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.545
Well, I was
thinking about it.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.647
I missed you too.

20:16.648 --> 20:19.648
- I like you so much, Steve.
- Oh, I love your chunky lips.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.718
No!

20:23.155 --> 20:25.156
Uh, hi.
Still waiting for bread sticks.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.157
I asked, like, five times.
I don, know if this is your station.

20:29.695 --> 20:32.695
They're so...
happy together.

20:33.131 --> 20:36.131
Steve's right.
It's me that's been ugly.

20:36.168 --> 20:39.168
Inside... and outside.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.740
Hand me those rolls.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.476
Don, do it, bro.
You're a fatty.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.979
No! No!

20:47.980 --> 20:50.980
Bro! Bro! Bro! Bro!

20:54.686 --> 20:57.686
Steve, whether you wanna date a fatso,
a girl with hairy arms...

20:57.789 --> 20:59.857
or even one with
Kirsten Dunst teeth...

20:59.858 --> 21:01.859
it doesn't, matter to me.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.860
- If you're happy, I'm happy.
- Thanks, Dad.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.231
It's good
to have you back, Stan.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.233
It's good to be back.

21:09.234 --> 21:12.234
Hayley, are you wearing makeup?
You look like a whore.
