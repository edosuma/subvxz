00:10.720 --> 00:11.881
Previously on "Power..."

00:12.040 --> 00:13.530
You recognize
the name Simon Stern?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.842
He's one of the biggest
nightlife investors in New York.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.411
You got some fine-ass-looking
girls serving drinks

00:17.560 --> 00:18.561
in there, by the way.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.961
There was this one, red hair,
tall, what's her name?

00:21.160 --> 00:22.400
Her name is
"Don't touch the merchandise,

00:22.560 --> 00:23.561
motherfucker."

00:23.720 --> 00:25.563
Not everybody
understands us, Jamie.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.563
I'm not going anywhere,
Tasha, I'm stuck here.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.721
Right where you want me.

00:28.920 --> 00:29.921
We'll have us a meeting.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.320
I sit across the table,
I look all those motherfuckers

00:32.479 --> 00:34.369
in the eye, and I find out
whose hitting me,

00:34.520 --> 00:37.251
once and for all.
Until then, no one gets product.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.609
So Lobos' New York distributor
is meeting with his network.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.410
So not only is he
not getting us product,

00:42.600 --> 00:44.682
but he doesn't
respect us enough to be here.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.887
FBI, let me see
your hands!

00:46.040 --> 00:48.168
Why you switch up the spot
for the meeting at the last second?

00:48.360 --> 00:49.361
You can never be too careful.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.521
Where the fuck is Anibal?

00:54.240 --> 00:56.049
I never stopped
thinking about you.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.241
All these years.

02:35.900 --> 02:43.900
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:00.560 --> 03:01.607
Hey, hey!

03:03.240 --> 03:06.483
Oh, yeah, that's right, girl.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.644
It feels like we're 15 again,
sneaking out of my parents' apartment.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.929
It ain't like that.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.287
My driver's
parked in the back.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.087
Of course.
Just like when we were 15.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.282
I could've taken a cab.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.204
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

03:45.320 --> 03:46.481
Um, Angie, are we--

03:46.640 --> 03:48.085
What?

03:48.240 --> 03:50.004
Okay, I guess.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.761
Better than okay, I think.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.488
Good night,
Angela.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.767
Good night, Jamie.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.404
Watch that turn now,
Raina, okay?

05:05.440 --> 05:06.441
Hold that out a little.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.602
- You sound really good.
- Thank you.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.603
And you will, too, if you do
what I said.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.728
Good morning,
sleepyhead.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.166
Morning.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.163
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.084
Yeah, the count was off,
so we stayed

05:18.240 --> 05:20.083
to make sure it was right.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.526
And y'all woke me up
with those beautiful voices.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.047
You keep singing like that,
guarantee you get the lead.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.929
The fifth graders
never get it.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.081
Yeah, but, baby girl,
they never seen

05:27.240 --> 05:29.242
a fifth grader
like my Raina St. Patrick.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.880
You come from good stock, girl.
You hear me, huh?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.088
Your daddy's looks
and your mama's voice?

05:34.240 --> 05:36.049
Whatever, Negro.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.326
Uh-huh.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.567
Gross.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.721
Gross?
Give me some sugar.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.041
Wait, are you trying to--

05:41.200 --> 05:43.009
What?
Mmm.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.006
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.207
Have a good day
at school.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.089
- Okay.
- All right.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.485
Keep practicing that song.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.043
So we got
fuckups all around, don't we?

06:11.200 --> 06:15.285
The meeting information
from Nomar Arcielo was bogus.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.647
And I take full responsibility
for that, Frankie.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.325
But it's no worse than
the potential key

06:19.520 --> 06:21.807
to the whole investigation
getting murdered

06:21.960 --> 06:24.486
while you two idiots
were sitting outside.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.610
Saxe, what were you
doing there, anyway?

06:27.760 --> 06:31.526
You were supposed to write the warrant,
not go out on a field trip.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.331
And you distracted Agent Medina
from good surveillance.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.881
All due respect, Frankie,
I hardly think I'm to blame.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.687
You're right.
There's enough blame to go around.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.126
But the question is

06:42.280 --> 06:44.567
where do we go from here?

06:45.560 --> 06:48.006
If you were right and Anibal
was the distributor

06:48.160 --> 06:50.811
Lobos was unhappy with,
then Lobos had the biggest

06:50.960 --> 06:52.166
motive to call a hit.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.322
If we find Anibal's killer,
there's a chance

06:54.480 --> 06:56.164
we could connect
Lobos directly.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.641
We're gonna need NYPD
cooperation for that.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.801
Good luck with that.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.122
The detective on the case,
Meredith Haines,

07:02.280 --> 07:03.441
is a power-tripping bitch.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.886
Takes one to know one, Saxe.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.644
I'll talk to Detective Haines.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.006
Let you know what I find out.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.491
I'll drive you to the precinct.
I've got some friends over there.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.766
If Detective Haines
is as prickly as they say,

07:13.920 --> 07:15.843
then I'm better off
going alone

07:16.000 --> 07:18.162
so we can talk
woman-to-woman.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.481
You wanna try calling
Nomar?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.165
- He's not responding to our calls.
- Yeah, okay.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.971
But at some point, we need to talk
about the dresser situation

07:24.120 --> 07:25.167
from the other night.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.721
Later, okay?

07:31.840 --> 07:33.842
We're gearing up
for my High Holy Day.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.809
That some kind
of religious shit?

07:35.960 --> 07:39.521
No, we're celebrating
the day I got made.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.409
Born into the mighty
Soldado Nation,

07:41.600 --> 07:42.601
25 years ago.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.003
Boys in my crew are getting
snake tattoos on their arms today

07:46.160 --> 07:48.731
to honor me, Víbora.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.405
Dos decades
in the game.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.841
Always seems
like guys like us

07:53.000 --> 07:55.526
should be able
to not look over our shoulder.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.250
That's why Anibal's death
came as a surprise

07:57.400 --> 07:59.448
to me and my partner.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.171
Can't say it did
the same for me.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.163
Because you
made the order?

08:04.320 --> 08:06.049
Because he's
straight up fat, man.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.690
You ever see
that motherfucker eat?

08:10.880 --> 08:13.929
I'm a businessman like you.
I don't wish death on any man.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.650
Except if it benefits
my pockets.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.882
Maybe you're trying to take over
the Taínos' turf.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.281
I got enough trouble maintaining
my own territory.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.680
I don't want to expand.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.841
What about that shit
you were talking

08:23.000 --> 08:24.240
at the Chinese spot?

08:24.440 --> 08:25.771
About another connect.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.206
I know a guy
who knows a guy.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.401
But it's not
your product's quality.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.405
You here to accuse me
of something or not?

08:31.560 --> 08:33.369
Because not too long ago
you came to me for help.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.682
And I strapped your crew up.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.640
Reason I'm here, papá.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.721
Yeah?

08:47.320 --> 08:49.448
You'd open up that damn pipeline
again like you did for Rolla.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.843
But I haven't seen shit.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.443
Give me a couple days
to get some things back in order.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.481
You'll be flying high again.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.011
Víbora.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.411
Hmm.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.081
For a minute there,
you had me thinking

09:25.240 --> 09:26.241
you weren't gonna kill him.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.640
Motherfucker straight up
lied to my face.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.801
Didn't he, Tommy?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.128
Knowing damn well he met
with Lobos about steppin' it up.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.566
Told you it was
Ruiz all along.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.960
Yeah, except when you said
it was Anibal.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.248
Except that I don't care,
now I just want to kill a motherfucker.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.687
Yo, Shawn, you ready
to finally get your dick wet?

09:38.840 --> 09:39.841
- Tommy!
- No, it's cool,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.001
Uncle G, I wanna help.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.605
Did I ask you anything,
Shawn? Huh?

09:42.760 --> 09:45.843
- He ain't ready.
- Hey, the kid handled himself

09:46.000 --> 09:47.081
at the meeting, Ghost.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.561
Ain't it time we let him
step it up like his dad did with us?

09:51.360 --> 09:52.725
Kid ain't ready.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.403
All right, get out of here.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.403
What's wrong with you, man, huh?
What's wrong?

09:58.560 --> 09:59.561
How's he gonna get ready?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.165
Driving you around ain't prepping
him for no real shit.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.924
Ruiz is too hard of a target.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.485
Shawn's green,
he'll get himself killed.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.005
How the fuck we supposed
to explain to Kanan,

10:06.160 --> 10:07.161
who gets out in a year,
that he's coming home

10:07.320 --> 10:08.810
to no money
and no son?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.490
Fine, I'll do it.
Fast and clean,

10:10.640 --> 10:11.641
Ruiz won't know
what hit him.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.205
Nah, I don't want any of our hands
getting dirty on this.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.850
Okay? We need to outsource

10:15.000 --> 10:16.968
so we have plausible deniability
in case something goes wrong.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.485
I do it, ain't shit
gonna go wrong.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.045
Important thing
is it stops, all right?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.361
The streets don't need
to know we did it.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.601
So long as it gets done.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.285
Fine, you want
to blow loot, fuck it.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.851
- I'll just call in the dreads.
- Good.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.411
What?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.840
I just can't help but think
none of this shit

10:29.000 --> 10:31.765
would be going down
if Kanan were here.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.965
If Kanan were here,
we'd still be working the corner.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.685
Cheer up.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.842
Let the Jamaicans
do their thing, man. Huh?

10:40.840 --> 10:42.205
It'll all be over,
it can go back to business.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.361
The way you want it, right?

10:43.520 --> 10:45.602
- Right.
- Right?

10:46.680 --> 10:47.727
Right.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.731
I just want to talk about
Aníbal Santalises' murder.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.040
Give me what you have.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.487
And I'll give you whatever
federal resources

10:59.640 --> 11:01.324
you need
to clear this case.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.923
And you'll get all the credit.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.805
The victim's throat
was slashed

11:13.960 --> 11:17.169
and he was gouged in his chest
in the shape of a trident.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.049
Calling card
of the Soldado Nation.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.844
It's damn near
impossible to confirm.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.685
Soldados don't so much
as talk to outsiders.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.842
Then what if I can
get you an insider?

11:29.760 --> 11:31.967
I'm listening.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.202
I'll just need your help
finding him.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.040
Why am I not surprised
to see you here?

11:43.200 --> 11:46.682
I could have gone to any
of 128 nightclubs in Manhattan.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.365
Yeah, but you wound up
right here at Truth.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.164
My client signed off
on your nightclub

11:50.320 --> 11:52.004
when they found out what
I was getting on the back end.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.083
And what exactly is that?

11:54.240 --> 11:56.846
Have your people draw up a contract,
you're getting all four parties.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.445
You should know
that Simon Stern

11:58.600 --> 12:00.364
fired his entire
event management team

12:00.520 --> 12:02.249
when he found out
that he was underbid.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.164
You're not making any friends.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.324
It's not personal,
just business, Cynthia.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.050
For now.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.726
Congratulations,
James St. Patrick.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.291
Every boldfaced
name in town

12:13.440 --> 12:15.966
is going to walk through
those doors this season.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.724
Well played.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.968
Thank you,
Cynthia Sheridan.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.089
I look forward
to working together.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.521
I'd like to order some soup.

12:46.680 --> 12:50.480
Right now, the only thing
we have is fish tea.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.849
I had my heart set
on some mannish water.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.406
Sorry, we're out of that
at the moment.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.041
But why don't you look
at the menu and see

13:04.200 --> 13:06.441
if there's anything else
you want to to order.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.561
I was hoping to get some
in the next two days.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.769
Let me talk to my son.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.207
I'll contact you when he
make another batch.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.286
What part is your daughter
auditioning for?

13:43.440 --> 13:45.363
She's also
going out for Annie.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.404
That must be Suzie's fault.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.324
She played the female lead
last year, too,

13:50.480 --> 13:53.006
even though
she was only in 5th grade.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.845
Must make the other girls
think they have a shot.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.602
Thank you, Suzie, nicely done.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.524
- Raina St. Patrick--
- I just would hate

14:07.680 --> 14:09.284
for your daughter
to get her hopes up.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.369
Raina will be just fine.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.682
For you.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.841
- Actually, I'm--
- I was told to have

14:43.000 --> 14:45.002
this waiting for you.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.610
No.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.680
It's not polite to make
a lady drink alone.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.160
I just want to remember everything
that happens tonight.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.362
Aren't you
presumptuous?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.802
What line of work
are you in, Carlos?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.165
I'm a salesman.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.368
Oh, so what do you sell?

15:39.040 --> 15:40.246
I sell people...

15:40.400 --> 15:45.611
...a fantasy.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.327
That feels a little
too real to me.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.689
Hey, come on,
don't do that.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.331
Stay here.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.931
In the moment.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.684
You and me.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.684
- Jamie?
- Who's Jamie?

16:10.840 --> 16:12.808
Have we been here before?

16:14.840 --> 16:17.207
I didn't think you'd remember.

16:21.160 --> 16:24.289
Saved all my money
to bring you to the city.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.205
And then could barely afford
the tokens to get back.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.202
I was going crazy.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.682
Trying to decide the right moment
to kiss you.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.526
How about now?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.489
Why is our fridge
the first place you start

17:04.640 --> 17:06.210
every time
you come over here?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.169
- It's hard out here for a pimp.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.560
Uh-uh.
Don't start.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.801
You know how Ghost gets
about his Junior's.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.564
He was supposed
to meet me here at 9:00.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.922
He's late.
It's his fuckin' fault.

17:16.079 --> 17:19.242
You noticing Ghost
has been MIA a lot lately?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.204
Can you get
more of this shit?

17:25.359 --> 17:26.691
How much
do you need, boy?

17:26.839 --> 17:30.287
It's just--
I got a girl.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.482
I was thinking maybe
I'd bring her by for dinner.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.283
Something ain't right.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.771
You must be coming down
with something

17:38.920 --> 17:41.241
if you claiming girls, let alone
want to bring them by here.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.401
I like this chick.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.289
And I want to bring her
to dinner to see what you think.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.124
Stop making such
a federal case of it.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.521
You want me to pick your girl
for you, Tommy?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.250
What, I'ma let
my mom do it?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.289
Look, T,
I respect your opinion.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.886
If you like Holly,
that means a lot.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.045
All right.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.281
Bring her by tomorrow.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.091
I'll fry up some chicken
or something.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.844
Whoo!
Like old times!

18:04.000 --> 18:05.365
Like old times,
you eating up all my food,

18:05.560 --> 18:06.561
that's what it is.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.131
Mmm-mmm.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.327
What's wrong, Angie?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.643
Come on, talk to me.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.131
We've been friends
since 8th grade.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.281
If you can't tell me
what's on your mind,

18:29.440 --> 18:30.805
we got real problems.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.810
I wanna know
what we're doing here.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.246
Are we just fucking?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.164
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.401
Maybe don't think.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.688
Don't say that.
Men always say that.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.844
Look, last night
was last night.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.561
But if this happens again,
then I'm making a choice.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.482
I am making a choice.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.202
Right here.
Right now.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.850
With you.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.450
What is this?

20:12.600 --> 20:15.251
The wing.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.805
That's something I got
a long time ago.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.450
I wanted to fly away.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.729
Escape.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.928
I'm sure you
wouldn't understand.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.924
No, I understand.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.767
I missed a lot being away.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.971
You're better at that now.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.724
Some things have changed.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.687
What's all this?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.002
You know that show
"Hoarders"?

21:16.160 --> 21:18.208
That's my mom.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.124
It's her oldies and goodies
collection.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.806
Took it out her basement
to spin.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.400
On what?
A record player?

21:25.560 --> 21:29.007
Hell, yeah, it's the best way
to listen to music.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.725
Here. Check this out.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.648
My mother used to play
this song to death.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.484
I never heard this,
who is this?

21:54.640 --> 21:55.846
Smokey Robinson.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.042
You know, the Miracles?

22:05.080 --> 22:07.162
Stick with me.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.765
I'll teach you a lot.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.490
I'm not going anywhere.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.168
I want you to come to dinner
and meet my family.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.169
Your mother?

22:29.320 --> 22:30.481
No.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.927
My family.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.642
He's all yours.

22:47.280 --> 22:51.729
I should have known you
were behind these bullshit charges.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.606
Mami.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.969
You didn't return my calls.
What's a girl to do?

23:04.080 --> 23:06.606
It's that damn coverage plan I'm on.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.841
Phone company's a bitch.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.402
So are you for feeding me fake intel
about that meeting.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.211
Nah, there was a meeting,
the place got switched

23:14.360 --> 23:15.407
at the last moment.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.166
Of course it did.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.163
We're done here.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.288
Hey, hash that shit out.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.125
Now Víbora's gonna hook up
with the distributor again.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.801
Restock our drug supply.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.610
Fucking time.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.961
So you're serious?

23:32.120 --> 23:33.929
That meeting actually happened.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.969
That's what I said,
isn't it?

23:37.600 --> 23:39.045
You got trust issues, bruja.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.486
See someone about that.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.801
We need to get you
close to Ruiz

23:41.960 --> 23:44.088
so you can identify
this distributor.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.766
I'm not high enough
on the death chart to find out.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.206
Bullshit,
you were high enough

23:48.400 --> 23:49.686
to set up that meeting
with Lobos.

23:49.840 --> 23:53.242
And when that went south,
I did, too,

23:53.400 --> 23:54.447
in terms of juice.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.968
Well, here's
your chance to get it back.

23:59.120 --> 24:03.330
According to our files,
Ruiz's High Holy Day is coming up.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.642
I'm going to the party.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.844
But I won't get anywhere
near the inner circle.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.163
I got you here,
didn't I?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.482
Let me worry about
getting you in there.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.526
It's okay, baby.

24:20.680 --> 24:21.681
It's all right.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.889
It's okay.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.451
What happened?

24:26.600 --> 24:27.601
The school called.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.967
Raina didn't get
the part in the play.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.681
I don't know why they didn't pick me.
I did my best.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.001
Come here, baby girl.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.929
It's totally unfair, that's why.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.804
Raina was the best singer
on that stage

24:38.960 --> 24:40.121
and they gave it
to the little white girl.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.281
Tasha.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.727
They should have picked her,
not Suzie Spencer.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.564
I know how disappointing it is
to work hard for something

24:45.720 --> 24:46.721
and not get it.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.526
She busted her ass on this,
and they took it from her.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.524
But everything you want in life,
you don't get the first time.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.245
You gotta keep going for it.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.721
- You think?
- I know.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.120
You keep practicing
and next year

24:58.280 --> 25:00.089
you will be the lead,
I'm sure of it.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.571
Okay, Daddy.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.881
That's my girl.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.326
Give me some sugar.
I know you're not gonna

25:04.520 --> 25:06.249
run from me this time.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.686
Her school made a decision.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.205
And it was the wrong decision.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.686
We need to do
something about it.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.251
And that happens
sometimes in life.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.890
We're supposed
to prepare her for that.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.566
We can't go around correcting
every goddamn wrong.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.324
And we can't roll over
and chalk up everything

25:21.480 --> 25:22.720
as a loss either.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.690
I'm not letting Raina go through
the same shit I did.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.729
Just because you didn't make it
into Destiny's Child,

25:27.920 --> 25:29.843
don't mean that somebody's
out to get our daughter.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.567
Fuck you, Ghost.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.762
You know what
my mother did to me.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.729
Telling me
I would never make it.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.928
I gave up because of her.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.162
This ain't about your singing career,
it's about Raina.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.924
And I'm not telling her to give up,
the opposite.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.765
But she's not always gonna win,
and that's life.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.251
You need to let
this shit go, okay?

25:49.440 --> 25:50.441
Leave it alone.
You hear me?

25:50.600 --> 25:51.601
Leave it alone.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.762
Are we clear?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.568
We're having dinner with Tommy
and his girl tonight.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.609
Just make sure you're here.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.286
Tommy got a girlfriend?
Since when?

26:08.280 --> 26:10.408
Let's go, Shawn.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.250
So how'd it go at that meeting
with Tommy?

26:23.640 --> 26:24.971
It was good.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.487
Being out in the field.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.926
Yeah.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.081
Listen, man,
I know you wanna

26:30.240 --> 26:32.891
get out in the action
and be like your old man.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.326
No doubt.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.606
I get it.
Felt the same way.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.331
Your pops brought me
in the game,

26:38.480 --> 26:39.561
schooled me on everything.

26:39.720 --> 26:42.929
Make sure your word
is your bond.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.521
Never turn your back on your friends,
and most importantly,

26:45.680 --> 26:48.001
know when to talk
and when not to.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.841
God gave you two ears
and one mouth for a reason.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.207
You volunteered
to take a man's life today.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.361
Is that what you want?

26:58.520 --> 27:00.841
I'm ready to step up.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.607
If you want the street side
of the business, it'll happen.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.001
But not until I say so,
understood?

27:08.880 --> 27:11.531
Yes, sir.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.365
Because before you get out there
and be like your dad,

27:14.520 --> 27:16.727
I gotta be sure,
100 percent sure

27:16.880 --> 27:17.881
I can trust you with my life.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.008
With everything.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.010
I got your back,
Uncle G.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.128
100 percent.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.931
You like this fabric?

27:37.080 --> 27:39.401
Yeah, it's tight.
You getting another one?

27:39.560 --> 27:42.370
No, you are.

27:50.320 --> 27:54.041
Acting the part is one thing, Shawn.
You gotta look the part as well.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.880
Víbora Ruiz has a thing
for poisonous snakes, huh?

28:09.080 --> 28:10.923
Hmm. Been caught smuggling
illegal species

28:11.120 --> 28:13.088
into the country
a couple of times.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.402
You know anyone over at ICE?

28:17.560 --> 28:19.244
Yeah, I got
a customs guy, why?

28:19.400 --> 28:24.770
Nomar confirmed the meeting
with the distributor actually happened.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.241
The guy we've been looking for
is still alive.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.448
And I'm gonna get
my CI to ID him.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.291
That guy just screwed over
the whole goddamn department.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.481
Are you talking about
using him again?

28:33.640 --> 28:36.291
Next to you, I've got the biggest
hard-on for Lobos in this place.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.482
And this is the best lead
either of us has.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.883
So let's pool our resources
and bust his ass.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.451
All right.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.965
If I do this for you,
maybe you can

28:45.160 --> 28:46.924
clear something up for me.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.770
Sure.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.649
How long you been
fucking Agent Knox?

28:50.800 --> 28:51.926
Excuse me?

28:52.120 --> 28:54.043
I'm an undercover agent
trained to read people.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.568
Obviously, there's something
going on between you two.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.609
There's nothing going on.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.609
Whatever.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.121
Melissa.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.441
You seen Holly?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.688
She called in sick.
Again.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.921
Guess she thinks 'cause
she's fucking the boss,

29:10.080 --> 29:11.206
she doesn't have to
follow the rules.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.361
Wait, what?

29:12.560 --> 29:14.801
Not the black one,
the white guy, Tommy.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.201
You ask me,
he's an asshole.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.241
No argument
from you there.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.848
Boss wants us starting
the secret VIP entrances tonight

29:23.000 --> 29:24.001
and I need her here.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.969
I gotta call her.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.525
Chasing down these
fucking employees.

29:30.840 --> 29:33.605
I'm sorry, sir,
we're not open to the public yet.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.489
It's okay.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.130
I'm not the public.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.282
Mr. Stern.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.481
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

29:45.640 --> 29:46.687
You haven't got
in the shower yet?

29:46.840 --> 29:47.841
Babe, we got plenty of time.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.490
They're gonna be here
any minute.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.160
You're the reason why they say
black folks are always late.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.685
No, they say black folks
are always late

29:53.840 --> 29:55.365
'cause we're always late.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.364
Hell, no.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.602
Not tonight.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.281
Hello.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.441
Good evening, Mrs. St. Patrick,

30:32.640 --> 30:34.722
It's Joshua Kantos
from Truth.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.882
I left a message for the boss
on his cell phone,

30:37.040 --> 30:38.530
but it's very important
that I talk to him.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.569
- Is he available?
- He's in the shower.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.722
I'll have him return
when he gets a minute.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.042
This is very important.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.566
It always is, Kantos.

30:49.720 --> 30:50.721
I'll be sure
to let him know.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.041
Please, Mrs. St. Patrick,
it's very important

30:52.240 --> 30:53.890
that I get ahold of him--

30:54.080 --> 30:55.889
All right, babe,
the doorman just buzzed.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.445
Tommy and his date
are on the way up.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.171
By the way, you see
my cell phone?

31:00.320 --> 31:02.687
Oh, yeah,
it's right here, babe.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.723
- Oh, cool.
- You get the door, okay?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.922
- I gotta go freshen up a bit.
- All right.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.806
Hey, Tommy.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.611
What's up, G?

31:14.760 --> 31:16.922
I think y'all
know each other.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.924
Holly.
Holly from the club.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.923
Nice to see you,
Mr. St. Patrick.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.401
Oh, you can
call him James.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.085
- Hello.
- My lovely wife.

31:26.280 --> 31:27.770
Hi, I'm Tasha.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.082
Hi, Tommy told me
all about you.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.282
I had no idea
Mr. St. Patrick, the big boss,

31:35.440 --> 31:36.930
- Oh, you little--
- was actually the brother

31:37.120 --> 31:39.168
he's always talking about.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.163
Yo, it's time to drink.
I'll pour it.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.971
T, why don't you
show Holly around?

31:44.120 --> 31:46.282
I'll take your coat.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.845
Holy shit!

31:58.000 --> 32:01.083
This thing is bigger
than my apartment!

32:04.440 --> 32:06.363
Is this Louis Vuitton?

32:06.520 --> 32:09.126
This thing costs like $1,000!

32:09.320 --> 32:10.481
$2,000.

32:10.640 --> 32:13.883
My husband brought it back
from his last business trip.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.849
That's what I want.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.651
That is real love.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.531
It's not about the gift, it's about
the fact he's thinking of you.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.364
And he thinks
you're worth the money.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.364
I'm sure Tommy will get you
anything you ask for.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.524
Tommy wouldn't know that bag
if I hit him in the face with it.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.850
You guys got it made.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.731
Yeah, I guess so.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.047
Nice, the good stuff.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.567
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32:45.720 --> 32:46.801
We got champagne!

32:46.960 --> 32:50.567
I am really impressed
with how you bounced back

32:50.720 --> 32:51.721
at your own club.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.530
I do have one question for you.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.365
How did you raise
the money so fast?

32:56.520 --> 33:02.050
I'm only a limited partner here, sir.
It's James St. Patrick's money.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.568
But you're the reason this place
is turning out to be so successful.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.165
I-- I couldn't say that.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.890
For a guy who's never been
in the business,

33:09.040 --> 33:10.041
James knows what he's doing.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.044
We're full every night,
extremely tight door.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.601
And once they're in,
every kind of customer

33:15.800 --> 33:17.040
gets specific treatment.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.531
The drinks
they ordered last time.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.721
The booth they love.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.291
The waitress
they wanted to fuck.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.885
Well, you'd know about that,
wouldn't you?

33:23.040 --> 33:26.487
We've got a great
system here, sir.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.165
Seeing as it's just
the two of us,

33:28.360 --> 33:30.522
what's St. Patrick's deal?

33:30.680 --> 33:32.728
Where's he from?
What's his background?

33:32.880 --> 33:36.566
I tried looking into him myself
and came up empty.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.566
What did he do before this?

33:42.080 --> 33:43.764
Remember JSP
and Tommy Toms?

33:43.920 --> 33:46.446
Please tell me Tommy Toms
was not your stage name.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.728
It was the '80s,
everybody had two names.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.685
- There was Lisa Lisa, Marky Mark.
- And Tommy Toms.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.247
That shit sounded like
a bad Chinese restaurant.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.846
You're not gonna sit there
and just blaze us up like that.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.162
Yo, let's bust out a verse, B.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.204
My husband always
used to do this rap

34:03.360 --> 34:04.725
about how we first met.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.450
Go for it, Tommy.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.125
I don't remember the words.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.041
Oh, come on, man.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.201
You know I hung my mic up
a long time ago.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.931
Boo. Party pooper.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.605
Mm-hmm.
That's my husband.

34:33.800 --> 34:37.121
Fine, if you ain't gonna rap,
I need you to work a bit.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.609
That club sure
keeps them busy, huh?

34:50.760 --> 34:52.683
Like you couldn't imagine.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.888
Mind if I use your bathroom?

34:55.040 --> 34:57.646
Sure.
It's right down the hall.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.722
We're all set
for the Jamaicans for tomorrow.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.882
Didn't I tell you
not to fuck the merchandise?

35:13.040 --> 35:14.405
Let's get one thing
straight from jump,

35:14.560 --> 35:16.642
you don't tell me shit.
I'm not a fucking child.

35:16.840 --> 35:17.841
You acting like one.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.047
Bringing breezies
over to my house.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.201
For show-and-tell?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.930
This ain't some
skank-ass broad.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.491
Holly's different.
She's special.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.887
Tonight she is.
Tomorrow morning she might be.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.041
Give me a fucking break.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.850
Come on, Tommy,
you and I both know

35:29.000 --> 35:30.809
you ain't gonna feel that way
in a month or a year.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.610
Why do you care
who I'm boning anyway?

35:32.760 --> 35:35.001
Because you're fucking someone
who works at my business,

35:35.160 --> 35:36.844
which makes this
about my business.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.923
Last I checked,
this was a 50/50 partnership,

35:39.080 --> 35:42.004
which makes Holly just as much
my employee as she is yours.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.527
Look, man, that just means
I can't fuck her either.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.721
But you better not have told her
about our other thing.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.206
This ain't my first rodeo.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.964
You think I'm fucking stupid?

36:00.880 --> 36:02.803
Hmm?

36:14.480 --> 36:16.084
The department
splurged on this?

36:16.240 --> 36:19.210
I may have submitted it
as a slightly different expense.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.562
We get Lobos,
no one will care.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.530
You manipulated NYPD
and customs?

36:24.680 --> 36:27.411
You don't give two shits
about protocol, do you?

36:27.560 --> 36:29.801
Just like you fucking Knox
right under Frankie's nose.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.001
Not this again.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.923
Why do you care?

36:37.080 --> 36:38.081
'Cause I don't want you
to fuck up again.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.730
And if Knox's dick
is the reason

36:39.920 --> 36:41.285
you got distracted last week,
I want to know.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.566
Were you sucking Saxe off?

36:42.760 --> 36:44.205
Is that why
you missed Anibal's doer?

36:44.360 --> 36:48.729
Your head was under the dashboard,
Saxe's eyes were closed.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.284
Where's your fucking key?

37:08.160 --> 37:09.286
I heard voices.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.124
Wanted to make sure
the coast was clear.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.406
I got you
just the ticket

37:12.560 --> 37:13.641
to get you
in the high council

37:13.800 --> 37:14.961
of the Soldado Nation.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.088
You must be offering yourself
or a ton of drugs.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.446
'Cause pussy and pot
are the only things

37:18.600 --> 37:19.647
that will get me next to Ruiz.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.731
Whoa, can you watch your mouth?
There's a lady present.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.530
Who the fuck is this?

37:25.720 --> 37:28.963
Nomar, this is Joe Gonzales,
a reptile specialist

37:29.120 --> 37:30.963
with the department.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.610
Why you always
bring in new people?

37:32.760 --> 37:35.843
This is supposed to be
an A and B situation.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.287
Reptile man
needs to see his way out.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.164
Okay, but

37:40.360 --> 37:44.922
not until I show you
how to handle this.

37:49.880 --> 37:50.961
Whoa.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.481
Holly!

38:11.680 --> 38:14.889
I got your coat, come on.
We outta here.

38:19.520 --> 38:20.646
Bye, Tasha.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.926
Bye, James.

38:22.080 --> 38:25.721
I'll see you
at work tomorrow?

38:25.880 --> 38:26.881
See you, T.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.371
Thank you.

38:28.520 --> 38:32.206
Yeah.

38:32.360 --> 38:34.522
They're like "The Cosby Show,"
you know?

38:35.800 --> 38:37.325
She seems to have it all.

38:37.480 --> 38:41.087
Other than the fact
that her husband's cheating on her.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.924
What did you just say?

38:43.080 --> 38:45.845
I was dropping some receipts off
in the office the other night.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.369
And I walked in on Mr. St. Patrick
nailing some Latina.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.921
You need to mind
your own fucking business.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.081
What did I do?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.163
Just shut the fuck up!
Damn!

38:57.320 --> 38:59.926
Tommy!

39:00.080 --> 39:04.927
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.486
What are you
apologizing for?

39:11.640 --> 39:14.883
That made you angry.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.570
And I don't like
seeing you that way.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.564
Shhh.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.402
I like it when you feel good.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.081
Where you been?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.607
You're not gonna believe this,
but Medina finally got on board.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.250
Helping me with the Nomar thing.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.602
Nomar should be in
at Ruiz's party tomorrow night.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.764
Look, I'm not trying to be a dick,
but technically Nomar is my CI,

39:45.920 --> 39:47.763
so if you wanted to let Medina in,
you should have at least

39:47.920 --> 39:48.921
consulted me first.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.651
I know you're upset,
but can we talk some other time?

39:51.800 --> 39:53.529
Because I'm running late
to meet some friends.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.681
Yeah, sure.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.604
Some other time.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.171
Like when you're ready
to be honest with me.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.651
You know, whenever that is.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.564
- Greg.
- Are you sleeping with Medina?

40:01.720 --> 40:05.088
It's not like it's not your MO
to fuck somebody at work.

40:06.360 --> 40:07.600
Fuck you, Greg.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.131
Not lately.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.441
We're gonna talk
about this tomorrow.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.284
No, no. We're going
to talk about this now.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.646
I gotta go.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.802
I'm not letting you
walk out that door.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.847
Can I at least tell my friends
I can't show up?

40:29.480 --> 40:30.481
Rolla, what up?

40:30.640 --> 40:32.768
I hear the fat man got murked.

40:32.920 --> 40:33.967
I don't know who you got
on them corners, but--

40:34.160 --> 40:36.208
Rock Street Killers ready
to step up and take one for the team?

40:36.360 --> 40:38.328
No question, I done kept it 100
with you and white boy

40:38.480 --> 40:39.766
- from the jump.
- Good.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.843
Tommy filled me in
on the meeting.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.328
But we still haven't found out
who's hitting us.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.403
Unless you got something
you want to spill.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.164
Negative.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.846
Well, Taínos got Aníbal's
number 2 in place already.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.889
I don't see any reason for him
to lose his territory.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.929
Unless you doing
some serious ear hustling

40:56.080 --> 40:58.287
and wanna help me kill
the motherfucker behind this shit.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.441
On it.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.688
All right. Later.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.728
First of all,
I'm not fucking Medina

41:09.880 --> 41:11.006
or anyone at the office.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.400
Anyone else, you mean?

41:12.560 --> 41:14.210
People get into relationships
at work, Greg.

41:14.360 --> 41:17.364
When you spend 20 hours a day
together in an office, it happens.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.567
I'm not a whore.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.041
- I never said that.
- Funny, I heard it loud and clear.

41:22.120 --> 41:24.202
Medina asked me today
if I was fucking you.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.361
And what did you tell him?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.966
That nothing was going on.

41:28.120 --> 41:31.010
He was asking because I fucked up
the raid the other day.

41:31.160 --> 41:34.209
I don't wanna fight
with you, Greg.

41:34.360 --> 41:37.364
I just wanna catch Lobos
and call it a day.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.602
I gotta be able to talk
to our other colleagues

41:39.760 --> 41:41.649
without you thinking
I'm sleeping with them.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.565
I gotta be able to meet our CI
without you breathing down my neck.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.563
I gotta have
some space, Greg.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.881
You know what?
You can blame this

41:48.040 --> 41:49.201
on our jobs
as much as you want.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.765
But this is
a "you" problem.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.529
So whatever it is,
whatever's going on with you,

41:54.680 --> 41:57.729
Jesus, good luck.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.724
Here's your space.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.446
Morning, Shawn.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.325
Hey.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.648
Is that a new suit?

42:28.800 --> 42:30.245
Yeah.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.920
Let me see how it looks.

42:37.760 --> 42:40.206
This has my husband
written all over it.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.761
Yeah, I'm going to go visit
my dad again in a few days.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.046
G wanted me to look nice.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.363
You and Ghost
are getting pretty close.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.567
You probably see a lot
driving him around,

42:49.720 --> 42:52.451
huh, Shawn?

42:56.520 --> 42:59.251
This suit fits you perfectly.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.085
And I love how it feels.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.803
I think he's keeping
something from me.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.645
And I want to know how long
it's been going on.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.644
I wish I knew what
you were talking about.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.245
You're a terrible liar.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.201
What's going on between
my husband and Tommy?

43:27.080 --> 43:32.086
Well, um, they've been having
a lot of disagreements lately.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.321
Disagreements about what?

43:33.480 --> 43:36.643
Hmm?
You can tell me.

43:36.840 --> 43:40.322
It'll be another one
of our little secrets.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.762
I don't really know.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.160
They've been beefing
ever since we got back

43:47.320 --> 43:48.651
- from that meeting.
- Tasha!

43:48.800 --> 43:49.801
Shawn out there?

43:49.960 --> 43:51.450
Yeah, he's
reading the paper.

43:52.440 --> 43:54.408
- Morning, boss, you ready?
- Morning. Yeah.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.291
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.681
Whatever you want.

44:08.840 --> 44:11.320
Hey, let me call you back!

44:11.480 --> 44:12.970
You got my messages?

44:13.120 --> 44:15.691
What messages?

44:17.240 --> 44:20.005
Simon Stern came
into the club last night.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.521
You'd better be shitting me.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.326
You were MIA,
so I bonded with Stern.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.369
Skinning and grinning
my way around a conversation

44:27.560 --> 44:29.164
about us underbidding him
for those parties.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.049
You trying to angle to get
a job with him, huh?

44:31.200 --> 44:32.690
No, I left you a message
on your voicemail

44:32.840 --> 44:34.205
and I tried you at home.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.641
Your wife said that you were
in the shower.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.848
I did my job.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.721
I didn't see one missed call
or a fucking voicemail, Kantos.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.689
You were hooking up VIPs
with bottle girls

44:44.840 --> 44:46.649
at the last club you worked.

44:46.800 --> 44:49.565
No one would hire you
with a fist full of 50s.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.246
So don't stand there
acting like your ass don't stink

44:52.400 --> 44:54.641
or I'll send you back
to your P.O. to air out.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.245
Next time, you get in
your fucking car

44:56.400 --> 44:57.401
and you drive
to my fucking house,

44:57.560 --> 45:00.882
you hear me?

45:01.040 --> 45:04.283
I heard Raina's audition.
She sang well.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.568
Obviously, not well enough.

45:06.760 --> 45:09.684
These roles are limited
and typically granted to 6th graders.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.411
Except Suzie Spencer
got the lead last year...

45:12.600 --> 45:14.329
...as a 5th grader.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.443
Mrs. St. Patrick,

45:16.600 --> 45:20.446
three generations of Spencers
have matriculated through our school.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.284
I'm sure you understand.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.649
The decision's been made
in the matter.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.448
Oh, has it?

46:26.640 --> 46:28.961
Víbora.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.451
¡Felicitaciones!

46:34.120 --> 46:35.645
What's that?

46:35.800 --> 46:37.802
A tribute for Víbora.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.005
Whoo!

47:26.760 --> 47:30.287
How did you get this
in the country?

47:30.440 --> 47:31.771
Happy High Holy Day, Víbora!

47:41.120 --> 47:43.009
Thank you, ma'am.

47:45.840 --> 47:46.921
It goes a long way,

47:47.080 --> 47:48.161
but we're talking about
winning championships.

47:48.320 --> 47:49.367
Not winning games...

47:51.120 --> 47:54.442
I mean this is gonna
take this to the next level.

47:55.800 --> 47:56.961
I'll be right back, babe.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.451
Baby, you wanna tell me
why you didn't tell me

47:58.640 --> 48:00.961
Kantos called last night?

48:01.120 --> 48:03.248
I must have forgot
with all the running around

48:03.440 --> 48:04.441
with the dinner.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.364
Well, I missed a very important meeting
with Simon Stern.

48:07.720 --> 48:08.960
Sorry.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.330
Hello.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.848
May I ask who's calling?

48:24.040 --> 48:26.850
Raina, pick up the phone!

48:35.680 --> 48:37.205
Mom, Dad, I got the part.

48:37.360 --> 48:38.407
What?

48:38.600 --> 48:40.090
That was the drama director,
they made a mistake.

48:40.240 --> 48:42.527
I've been double cast
with Suzie to play Annie.

48:42.680 --> 48:45.081
Wow, congratulations, honey!

48:45.240 --> 48:46.685
- Oh, I'm so proud of you!
- Look at that!

48:46.840 --> 48:47.841
Look at that.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.764
I told you it would work out
in the end, baby girl.

48:49.920 --> 48:52.048
I gotta go call
all my friends!

48:52.240 --> 48:53.765
- All of them!
- Go ahead.

48:56.840 --> 48:57.841
Um, I'll be right back,
we're out of milk.

49:14.520 --> 49:15.681
Yo, I ain't got

49:15.840 --> 49:17.842
a 420 text from you
in a minute, T.

49:18.840 --> 49:20.649
I got some extra good shit
to mark the occasion.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.211
- All right?
- You must really need to hit this.

49:22.360 --> 49:25.045
Yeah, but don't be rolling up
in front of my building.

49:25.200 --> 49:26.201
Damn!

49:26.400 --> 49:27.970
Ghost hates it
when I smoke.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.645
Fuck that.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.962
He don't need to know.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.368
That girl Holly
is way too fast for you.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.204
Seriously?

49:40.360 --> 49:43.569
You like her, you like her.
But that's just my two cents.

49:43.720 --> 49:45.085
Noted.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.325
Relax, I'm a pro at this.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.323
Yeah, all right.
I can't tell.

49:52.480 --> 49:53.891
Nigga, I got kids.

49:58.960 --> 50:00.769
Look, I know like I'm starting
to sound like a broken record,

50:00.920 --> 50:02.922
but your boy's head
ain't in the game.

50:03.080 --> 50:05.162
You know Ghost is always
on some next shit.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.368
Come on, we'll be out
your hood in a minute.

50:10.520 --> 50:12.204
Ain't no one
gonna see your ass.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.481
I'm just saying.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.608
He depends on us
to keep him grounded.

50:21.760 --> 50:25.367
But now he's talking to me sideways,
disrespecting you and shit.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.045
- Nah.
- Don't lie to me to my face.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.201
You left early
the other night

50:28.360 --> 50:29.930
because you and Ghost
got into a fight, right?

50:38.800 --> 50:40.802
You think Ghost
is drinking again?

50:40.960 --> 50:43.042
This ain't
no bottle problem, T.

50:45.200 --> 50:49.330
Maybe Ghost is just going through
some sort of midlife crisis.

50:49.520 --> 50:50.601
It's too early for that.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.921
I think it's just
this club shit.

50:57.080 --> 50:59.321
That's the symptom,
not the disease.

50:59.480 --> 51:01.608
Ghost is changing,
Tommy.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.842
I'm starting to think it ain't
a temporary thing.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.650
It's starting
to get crowded.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.848
Stay by me and keep your head
on the swivel.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.321
- ¡Salud!
- ¡Salud!

51:33.720 --> 51:35.802
Full-time!

51:36.800 --> 51:39.201
Come on, guys. Move.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.169
We don't have all night.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.967
I'll be
in the champagne room.

54:30.760 --> 54:31.761
Oh.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.361
Shit!

55:04.560 --> 55:06.961
¡Coño!
Víbora's hurt!

55:09.040 --> 55:11.566
Something's--

55:13.840 --> 55:14.887
What the fuck happened?

55:32.640 --> 55:34.608
- Move to the side!
- Come on, step back!

55:38.680 --> 55:41.490
You remember Tommy and I
had a rap group?

55:41.640 --> 55:44.041
JSP
and DJ Tommy Toms?

55:45.520 --> 55:47.443
You remember the rap
I made up for you?

55:47.600 --> 55:49.443
Mmm-hmm.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.327
It's a good thing you became
a businessman.

56:03.480 --> 56:05.528
Be quiet.

56:05.680 --> 56:06.681
You know you like it.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.091
It's work.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.004
I should probably get this.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.162
I'll take it in the other room.

56:21.880 --> 56:22.881
Tommy, what's up?

56:23.040 --> 56:24.041
What do you need?

56:24.200 --> 56:27.010
Nomar just called.
Ruiz has been stabbed.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.207
Are you serious?

56:28.400 --> 56:30.368
Ruiz got stabbed,
right in the chest.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.521
Excellent

56:31.680 --> 56:33.489
Apparently,
Nomar's in with him

56:33.640 --> 56:35.165
and they're heading somewhere
to get medical attention.

56:35.320 --> 56:36.970
It wasn't the Jamaicans we hired.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.764
Someone went after him
and missed.

56:38.920 --> 56:39.921
He ain't dead.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.167
Where are you?

56:41.320 --> 56:43.209
I'm on my way in
right now.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.361
So if someone else
swung at him,

56:44.520 --> 56:46.921
that means he's not
the source of our problem after all.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.970
We gotta meet up,
sort all of this out.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.122
Work is blowing up.
I gotta go.

59:29.700 --> 59:37.700
