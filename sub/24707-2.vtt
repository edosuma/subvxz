WEBVTT

00:01.158 --> 00:03.956
Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:06.430 --> 00:08.660
Hey, Greg! I've been shot!

00:08.733 --> 00:11.361
Andy, I'm late.

00:11.435 --> 00:13.426
For what?

00:14.605 --> 00:16.630
I'm late with my period.

00:16.707 --> 00:19.039
- The feeling isn't coming back, Greg.
- No, huh?

00:19.110 --> 00:22.307
No. I'm afraid here. I'm afraid, you know,
I'm gonna wind up a cripple.

00:22.380 --> 00:25.577
- So I've got a clear field here?
- All clear.

00:25.649 --> 00:29.415
- You ready for me?
- Yeah.

00:51.909 --> 00:55.003
I'm sorry that didn't work out yesterday,
us having you over.

00:55.079 --> 00:57.172
Hey, it's all right.
Sylvia okay?

00:57.248 --> 01:00.911
Yeah. We're just not, uh, a hundred percent
certain with a certain thing.

01:00.985 --> 01:04.113
Yeah.

01:04.188 --> 01:07.180
Well, it broke the ice between me and Diane,
you know, just you inviting us.

01:07.258 --> 01:09.692
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, we had dinner anyways.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.729
- How'd that go?
- Good.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.191
What do we got?

01:18.269 --> 01:21.534
D.O.A.'s a female, mid-30s-
Jennifer Wuthrich.

01:21.605 --> 01:24.438
- Multiple stab wounds in the upper torso.
- Anyone see anything?

01:24.508 --> 01:27.375
She lived here with her parents and one brother.
Brother's retarded.

01:27.445 --> 01:29.845
Parents go away over the weekend,
get back this morning.

01:29.914 --> 01:31.973
Brother's sitting in the apartment
covered with blood.

01:32.049 --> 01:34.347
- He give up a statement?
- Says he was asleep.

01:34.418 --> 01:36.648
While his sister got murdered.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.654
Ready?

01:43.360 --> 01:45.726
Mr. Wuthrich?
I'm Detective Simone.

01:45.796 --> 01:48.356
This is Detective Sipowicz.
We'd like to talk to you for a minute.

01:48.432 --> 01:51.492
Hey, now look. My wife is pretty upset.
Do you have to talk to her too?

01:51.569 --> 01:54.663
Sir, if you can give us a few details right now,
we think that'll be all right.

01:54.738 --> 01:57.468
Just tell us what happened
when you got home this morning.

01:57.541 --> 02:00.271
Frank was in with Jenny.

02:00.344 --> 02:02.335
He's mentally retarded.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.746
He was shakin'her.
He said he was trying to wake her up.

02:05.816 --> 02:07.909
- Did he have a weapon?
- I didn't see one.

02:07.985 --> 02:12.649
He should've been in a home. He belongs
in a care facility. We couldn't take care of him.

02:12.723 --> 02:15.715
Sir, has he ever tried to hurt
anybody before in the family?

02:17.027 --> 02:19.621
He's gone after a few people.

02:19.697 --> 02:21.927
He couldn't hold down a job
because he always gets into fights.

02:21.999 --> 02:24.866
They had him on medication for it.
All the good it did him.

02:24.935 --> 02:27.460
We have to talk to your son,
Mr. Wuthrich.

02:34.111 --> 02:36.375
Frank?

02:37.781 --> 02:40.511
- Frank.
- We're detectives, Frank.

02:40.584 --> 02:43.849
We need to talk about
what happened to your sister.

02:43.921 --> 02:47.186
- She's dead.
- Yeah. We need to talk about that.

02:47.258 --> 02:51.388
- Don't I need a lawyer?
- I told ya. You don't need a lawyer.

02:53.898 --> 02:56.890
Frank, we're just gonna find you a change
of clothes and get you washed up.

02:56.967 --> 03:01.529
And then we'll take you down to the station house
so we can talk about what happened. All right?

03:01.605 --> 03:04.287
I guess I don't need a lawyer.

04:18.094 --> 04:20.289
Detectives.

04:20.363 --> 04:23.298
- Joshua Astrachan, Community Affairs.
- Detective Russell.

04:23.366 --> 04:26.062
- Uh, Greg Medavoy.
- Thanks for coming down.

04:26.135 --> 04:30.196
It's a small concern. I did ask
for two male detectives.

04:30.273 --> 04:33.504
Uh, Detective Russell and I
are the ones that caught this.

04:33.576 --> 04:36.238
Not a problem. Just don't
try to shake their hands.

04:36.312 --> 04:38.644
The Hasidim aren't crazy
about touching women.

04:38.715 --> 04:40.910
- How lovely.
- And if you could, hang back a little.

04:40.984 --> 04:45.387
- Let your partner take the lead.
- You got it.

04:45.455 --> 04:48.891
Rabbi, these detectives are here
to investigate the theft of the Torah.

04:48.958 --> 04:51.552
Ah.

04:51.627 --> 04:54.926
Are you acquainted with the rituals
of theJewish faith, Detective?

04:54.998 --> 04:58.058
Uh, just very generally.

04:58.134 --> 05:00.602
This morning, the Medzhibozh Torah
was taken from our synagogue.

05:00.670 --> 05:03.662
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, the Medzhibozh Torah...

05:03.740 --> 05:07.506
came to this country 60 years ago
during the exodus from Poland.

05:07.577 --> 05:12.446
It is said that the great rabbinic and mystical
scholar, Rebbe Pinchas of Koretz himself...

05:12.515 --> 05:17.817
read the Torah with the Besht himself
in a shtibl outside Medzhibozh.

05:17.887 --> 05:20.947
They-They say that, huh?

05:21.024 --> 05:23.151
In terms of the present-day theft...

05:23.226 --> 05:26.957
has there been anybody in the building
recently who isn't usually here?

05:27.030 --> 05:29.260
Cleaning service, deliverymen, such like?

05:29.332 --> 05:32.631
- We had an exterminator here last week.
- Uh-huh.

05:32.702 --> 05:35.796
Also there's a caterer,
but he comes every week.

05:35.872 --> 05:39.000
Okay. Uh, if you could give me
their names and addresses...

05:39.075 --> 05:41.339
uh, that would-
that would be a big help.

05:41.411 --> 05:43.936
I'll send a print car by.
We'll dust the place.

05:44.013 --> 05:48.450
But being candid, gentlemen, I wouldn't put
much faith in physical evidence.

05:48.518 --> 05:51.612
If there's gonna be a break in this,
it's most likely to come from you all.

05:51.687 --> 05:53.678
We're not detectives, Detective.

05:53.756 --> 05:57.988
He means someone may call to sell it back,
and that would give us a lead.

05:58.061 --> 05:59.995
I see.

06:01.064 --> 06:03.055
Is it okay if I said that?

06:10.873 --> 06:13.034
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey.

06:13.109 --> 06:15.509
Did you happen to see
Detective Martinez today?

06:15.578 --> 06:18.638
Yeah. Looks like he's gonna be all right.
He's got a lot of feeling back.

06:18.714 --> 06:20.648
- Ah, that's terrific.
- Yeah.

06:20.716 --> 06:23.333
- You think he might be up for some casual visitors?
- I'm gonna later on.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.663
- Well, but you're like family.
- No, I'm not family.

06:26.736 --> 06:29.671
I'm, uh, just a concerned
fellow detective.

06:29.739 --> 06:32.003
Oh.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.078
Both of us know what went on
in that apartment.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.118
- I didn't do it.
- You killed your wife.

06:42.185 --> 06:44.119
Beating me isn't going
to make me say it.

06:44.187 --> 06:47.452
You're gonna say it, pal.
You're gonna give it up. Trust me.

06:47.524 --> 06:49.856
Detective Morrisey,
could I talk to you in my office, please?

06:49.926 --> 06:53.362
Yeah.

06:53.430 --> 06:56.058
That's like-
You paid two bucks for milk.

06:56.132 --> 06:58.760
Oh, Greg, come on.
Leave me alone.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.235
I thought, uh, Morrisey was
working 4:00-to-12:00's?

07:01.304 --> 07:03.704
He had a suspect in
for an interview.

07:03.773 --> 07:05.900
Again?

07:05.976 --> 07:09.309
- That has to stop.
- What are we talking about?

07:09.379 --> 07:12.610
I'm talking about that guy looking like
he just went with Mike Tyson.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.583
- That guy just killed his wife, Lieutenant.
- I'm not saying he didn't.

07:15.652 --> 07:20.089
Guy admits he kicked his wife's door down,
admits he beat her up.

07:20.156 --> 07:22.989
- Next morning, they find her dead.
- Guy's stood three interviews.

07:23.059 --> 07:25.755
I don't want to see him back in here
unless you got another card to play.

07:25.829 --> 07:28.457
- Like what?
- I don't know, Stu.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.829
Go back through the 61 's.
Check with Homicide.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.391
You mean, look for a pattern?
This is a wife murder.

07:33.470 --> 07:35.961
Did I make myself clear?

07:36.039 --> 07:39.475
Now, I don't want to see him in here
unless you got new evidence.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.670
Yeah, right.
Let me go look for a pattern.

07:47.484 --> 07:50.976
That's the D O.A.'s brother, Lieu.
The parents come home.

07:51.054 --> 07:54.319
They found him standing next to the dead girl.
He had blood all over him.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.189
- Did he give it up?
- The guy's retarded.

07:57.260 --> 08:00.161
He's wondering whether he should have a lawyer.
His father's waiving his rights.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.596
- If his father says it's okay, go ahead and talk to him.
- Yeah?

08:02.665 --> 08:05.600
Yeah.

08:05.668 --> 08:10.469
Mr. Wuthrich, we're gonna go ahead
and talk to Frank now about what happened.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.941
- Uh, would you like to be in there?
- No.

08:14.010 --> 08:17.036
Okay. Come on, Frank.
Donna, we'll be in 1.

08:17.113 --> 08:19.104
All right, Detective.

08:23.653 --> 08:26.588
Sit down, Frank. Here.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.748
We know this is hard
for you, Frank.

08:31.194 --> 08:33.856
We know how, uh, sad you must feel
about your sister.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.899
- I'm sad about her.
- But we have to clear up what happened.

08:36.966 --> 08:39.400
L- I don't know.

08:41.004 --> 08:43.837
Did you ever have any kind of disagreements
with Jennifer, Frank?

08:43.907 --> 08:47.070
- The television.
- You'd disagree with her about that?

08:47.143 --> 08:50.635
Watching television,
watching which programs.

08:50.713 --> 08:53.011
She got to watch Jerry Springer...

08:53.083 --> 08:56.143
so, uh, I just went to sleep.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.887
- This was last night?
- Uh-huh.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.687
- Then you must've went to sleep angry.
- No. No, I just went to sleep.

09:06.663 --> 09:11.691
Your dad says that you got pretty much
of a temper on you there sometimes.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.931
Sometimes I think
my dad doesn't like me.

09:15.004 --> 09:18.906
Mm-hmm. He says you lost your job
because you kept on getting into fights.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.569
No. No, no. That was at work.
That was at the bakery.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.204
I tried to do a goodjob.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.113
Every day, Jenny gave me a pencil
to take to work...

09:27.183 --> 09:29.777
so I could- I could
write things down.

09:29.853 --> 09:32.845
And then those guys- those guys-
They would break them...

09:32.922 --> 09:36.358
supposedly by accident,
every day.

09:36.426 --> 09:38.917
That made you mad, huh?

09:38.995 --> 09:42.795
Frank, you ever get mad atJenny,
like those guys at work?

09:42.866 --> 09:46.802
- Jenny gave me pencils.
- Yeah, but like with this Jerry Springer thing...

09:46.870 --> 09:49.304
- You had a disagreement there, right?
- I don't know.

09:49.372 --> 09:51.306
Because that happens sometimes.

09:51.374 --> 09:54.366
I mean, people make us upset, and then
we do things that we didn't mean to do.

09:54.444 --> 09:57.038
We had a fight,
and then I went to sleep.

09:57.113 --> 10:00.105
Frank, look. I know
you loved your sister.

10:00.183 --> 10:03.380
- Mm-hmm.
- But in this instance here, you had a disagreement.

10:03.453 --> 10:05.978
- Over what program to watch.
- Right.

10:06.055 --> 10:09.218
Somebody killed Jenny, Frank.

10:09.292 --> 10:11.283
Maybe this person didn't mean to.
Maybe he was upset...

10:11.361 --> 10:14.159
and it was the last thing in the world
that he wanted to do.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.164
My sister's dead now.

10:16.232 --> 10:19.963
And I know how bad
you feel about that.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.231
But listen, Frank, if you did it...

10:22.305 --> 10:24.796
- I know you didn't mean to.
- I wouldn't hurtJenny.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.502
I would've tried to protect her.

10:27.577 --> 10:29.511
I tried. I tried!
I tried when I woke up!

10:29.579 --> 10:31.570
Frank, no one was
in that apartment but you.

10:31.648 --> 10:34.674
Did you hurt your sister, without meaning to,
with losing your temper and all?

10:34.751 --> 10:36.685
- No, no.
- You didn't hurtJenny?

10:36.753 --> 10:39.688
- I would never hurtJenny.
- Somebody took a knife and killed her.

10:39.756 --> 10:42.418
- Well, I didn't do it!
- Where's the weapon, Frank?

10:42.492 --> 10:45.256
I would wantJenny alive.

10:51.267 --> 10:53.258
Oh.

10:55.838 --> 10:57.829
I don't want to talk
to you now.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.671
You don't talk to us, then we're gonna
have to put you in the cell here.

11:00.743 --> 11:05.271
Okay, I'll go in the cell.
I don't want to talk to you.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.355
- This is crazy. He ain't gonna go
without something specific.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.295
I'm gonna check with E.S.U.,
see where they are on this weapons search.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.763
- Hey, Sylvia.
- Hi, Bobby.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.802
- Excuse me.
- How's it going?

11:26.869 --> 11:28.860
I took the test.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.304
- You were gonna take it tonight.
- I changed my mind.

11:31.374 --> 11:33.535
How was the result?

11:33.610 --> 11:36.204
I'm pregnant, Andy.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.938
You're pregnant?

11:44.487 --> 11:47.718
I think we should be discreet
about this for now.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.816
Yeah, sure.

11:50.893 --> 11:54.727
- Those tests are pretty accurate.
- I'm pregnant.

11:56.499 --> 11:58.763
I wanted you to know
as soon as I did.

11:58.835 --> 12:01.998
I mean, I took
the test myself'cause...

12:02.071 --> 12:04.335
Well, suddenly I just had to.

12:04.407 --> 12:08.070
- But then I wanted you to know right away.
- I understand completely.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.545
And now I feel about 85% insane.

12:11.614 --> 12:14.515
Well, that could be part
of the entire process.

12:14.584 --> 12:16.745
- I have to go.
- What, you're going to work?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.753
Well, yes, Andy.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.915
I am an assistant district attorney.
I'm going to my office.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.927
- Good, then, if you feel that's a good idea.
- Yes.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.929
Congratulations.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.741
Andy?

12:49.819 --> 12:53.255
E.S.U.'s got nothing, man.
Lieu- He wants us to talk to the mother.

12:53.323 --> 12:56.918
She's seeing to the daughter's
funeral arrangement. Talk to us around 3:00.

12:56.993 --> 13:02.124
Also, he wants us to reach out to
the bakery manager where the kid used to work.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.133
- Good. Get the background.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:05.201 --> 13:09.103
- Get as much background as we can before we go to bat again.
- Good.

13:09.172 --> 13:11.800
I'll go bring the father up to speed then.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.002
We went with that determination-
that other thing.

13:16.179 --> 13:18.170
What are we talking
about here, Andy?

13:18.247 --> 13:23.048
The test results were positive.
That home urine test?

13:23.119 --> 13:27.613
- Andy, Sylvia's pregnant?
- I'm not supposed to discuss it- any details.

13:27.690 --> 13:30.454
- That's great, man. That's wonderful!
- Yeah.

13:30.526 --> 13:33.927
- She feels we should be discreet.
- Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Sure.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.565
- Yeah, thanks very much.
- Yeah.

13:40.970 --> 13:44.167
- We'll go talk to this guy.
- Yeah.

13:48.111 --> 13:50.636
Hey! What's goin' on?

13:50.713 --> 13:52.647
Why'd you call my wife?

13:52.715 --> 13:55.206
We're gonna talk to her, Mr. Wuthrich,
and your son's employer.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.582
What the hell for?
She's trying to make funeral arrangements.

13:57.653 --> 14:00.315
Your son's denying he was involved.

14:00.390 --> 14:03.723
Oh, for God's sake. He was
up to his elbows in her blood.

14:03.793 --> 14:07.160
Sir, your son is still our primary suspect.
Now we see that he won't confess right away...

14:07.230 --> 14:11.030
so before we reinterview him, we're gonna want
as much information as possible.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.364
He must've stabbed her
with a kitchen knife.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.371
Emergency Services is
looking for the weapon.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.203
They're going through garbage cans
and incinerators on your block.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.073
If we get something specific,
we can go back at Frank.

14:23.513 --> 14:25.879
- Well, in the meantime, he's gonna come home with me?
- No.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.849
We're gonna take him over to Bellevue,
have a psychiatric evaluation.

14:28.918 --> 14:33.287
- That way he's off the streets.
- All right. All right.

14:33.356 --> 14:36.883
- When we get more information, we'll talk to him again.
- Yeah. Yeah, I see.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.928
You should go home now, sir.
We'll contact you in a few hours.

14:39.996 --> 14:42.965
Why don't you let us do our job,
all right, Mr. Wuthrich?

14:43.032 --> 14:45.660
You like to see Frank
before you go?

14:47.637 --> 14:49.571
No.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.406
- I'll call Homicide.
- Yeah.

14:56.913 --> 14:59.905
- How's it going, guys?
- Yeah, how's it going, Morrisey?

14:59.982 --> 15:03.418
- Your Greek give it up yet?
- No, I got a whole new tact I'm taking.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.613
Checking these files
looking for a pattern.

15:05.688 --> 15:08.122
'Cause you never know what's out there.
Am I right?

15:08.191 --> 15:10.125
'Cause I know this Greek
killed his wife...

15:10.193 --> 15:13.060
but Fancy don't wanna let that get in my way
of exploring other options.

15:13.129 --> 15:17.065
- You just spat twice on my shirt.
- Well, I'm sorry.

15:17.133 --> 15:20.899
- These are the file folders on female stabbings?
- Just picked them up.

15:20.970 --> 15:25.566
- You mind if we take a look?
- Look all you want. Make our boss happy.

15:27.310 --> 15:29.505
So we think this kid did it?

15:29.579 --> 15:33.447
Uh, yeah, he probably did it.
I'm not a hundred percent.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.916
Yeah, 'cause the father
sure thinks he did it.

15:35.985 --> 15:39.421
You don't know how to go
at a kid like that with the interview.

15:39.489 --> 15:42.754
- Yeah.
- You don't know what's in their mind.

15:42.825 --> 15:44.759
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.317
- How's it going?
- Good.

15:46.395 --> 15:48.659
I'm gonna take a leak.

15:49.932 --> 15:52.594
- You available?
- For what?

15:52.668 --> 15:56.798
We're digging through all this stuff
on female stabbings.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.671
All right.
If that's your best offer.

16:02.912 --> 16:05.039
Andy.

16:05.114 --> 16:09.050
So, um, nothing to go back on
with that Wuthrich kid?

16:09.118 --> 16:11.450
Nothing yet. We're gonna
psycho him overnight.

16:11.521 --> 16:13.819
Good. Keep me posted.

16:15.591 --> 16:18.788
How old are you?

16:18.861 --> 16:20.522
Forty-two.

16:20.596 --> 16:24.794
- So you were 41 when you had your kid?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:24.867 --> 16:30.328
Yeah, uh, I'm, uh,
47 years of age myself...

16:30.406 --> 16:33.102
April 7.

16:37.513 --> 16:39.674
If I tell you something...

16:39.749 --> 16:43.981
- can you keep it in absolute confidence?
- Yeah.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.525
Excuse me?

16:50.593 --> 16:53.585
- Could I speak to Detective Medavoy?
- Certainly.

16:53.663 --> 16:57.360
- Detective?
- Ah, Rabbi.

17:00.169 --> 17:02.694
What can I do for you?

17:06.509 --> 17:10.536
Someone has contacted us
who says he has the Torah.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.547
Oh, is that right?

17:12.615 --> 17:15.378
He said he would return it
for a considerable sum of money.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.012
- Yeah? Did he name a figure?
- $2,000.

17:19.088 --> 17:21.852
And he does not want
the police involved.

17:21.924 --> 17:24.415
Uh-huh. Um...

17:24.492 --> 17:28.190
Uh, what's your feeling on this,
meeting with him yourselves?

17:28.263 --> 17:31.427
Detective Medavoy,
for 200 years...

17:31.500 --> 17:35.061
the Lubavitchers have devoted themselves
to the pursuit of God's wisdom.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.628
Uh, that- that's very interesting.

17:37.707 --> 17:40.369
L- I'm not sure what it means
in this connection.

17:40.443 --> 17:45.244
What does it mean?
It means that we are not a foolish people.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.077
Ah.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.918
So we got three apartments,
a dorm up at City College...

17:50.987 --> 17:54.923
a couple ofhookers at an S.R.O.
And two single families in Brooklyn.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.983
What, and you're telling me
you don't see a pattern here?

17:58.060 --> 18:00.722
We ought to get that kid
to Bellevue.

18:03.032 --> 18:05.796
If you throw out the two hookers,
that means they're all first floors.

18:05.868 --> 18:09.463
- You think that's anything?
- Killer who's afraid of heights?

18:10.906 --> 18:13.431
I'll go get the kid from Holding.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.444
- You got this?
- Yeah.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.310
Andy. Listen, I, um...

18:19.382 --> 18:22.112
I wanted to thank you
for helping things along.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.642
- I heard you got together anyways.
- Yeah, we did.

18:25.721 --> 18:29.782
- Just be sure to take it easy.
- I know the drill. I'll be careful.

18:29.859 --> 18:33.488
- How are things with you?
- Good. Okay.

18:39.235 --> 18:42.500
Can you keep a secret?

18:47.176 --> 18:49.872
- How's it going, Frank?
- Awful.

18:51.681 --> 18:55.276
- Where's my dad?
- He had to leave. He had to go take care of your mother.

18:55.351 --> 18:58.047
Well, how am I gonna
get home?

18:58.120 --> 19:02.216
Detective Sipowicz and I-We're gonna
take you to a different place, Frank.

19:02.291 --> 19:06.193
- What-What kind of difference place?
- So doctors can talk to you.

19:06.262 --> 19:08.560
- No!
- Frank, you gotta go.

19:08.631 --> 19:10.997
- Okay?
- What do you think? You think I killed Jenny?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.865
Well, we're not sure
what happened, Frank.

19:13.936 --> 19:16.097
Well, if I did it, I'm sorry.

19:16.172 --> 19:19.073
I mean, if I did it,
I don't know about it.

19:19.141 --> 19:22.542
What would help you
to remember?

19:22.611 --> 19:25.011
I won't talk to you.
I won't talk to you.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.140
Easy, easy, Frank.
Just take it easy, all right?

19:27.216 --> 19:29.616
- Let's be cool.
- No! I don't want to be cool!

19:31.887 --> 19:34.378
Come on. We'll go to the hospital,
Frank. Let's go.

19:34.457 --> 19:38.689
- I want my mom. I want my dad.
- Come on.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.696
Why can't I go home?
I want to go home.

19:56.746 --> 19:59.613
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey.

19:59.682 --> 20:03.618
- I have, uh, two messages for you.
- Thanks.

20:06.034 --> 20:09.231
He's, uh, better.
He's fine.

20:09.304 --> 20:11.898
I happened to stop by
as a friend.

20:11.973 --> 20:13.998
He's good.

20:14.076 --> 20:16.010
Good.

20:17.913 --> 20:21.576
All first floors,
all stabbed in their beds.

20:21.650 --> 20:24.551
Except the hookers.
The hookers aren't part of the pattern.

20:24.619 --> 20:27.053
Except for his D.O.A.
You got no sign of forced entry.

20:27.122 --> 20:29.716
He's got it coming through the window,
but the window's not forced.

20:29.791 --> 20:32.453
- What's my guy doing here?
- Yeah, Stu, um...

20:32.527 --> 20:35.690
we got six homicides
in disparate parts of the city.

20:35.764 --> 20:38.927
- All female stabbings in first-floor residences.
- I went through those files.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.991
My case is the only one
with forced entry.

20:41.069 --> 20:43.162
Now either those are
family-involved homicides...

20:43.238 --> 20:45.172
or you got a killer for your pattern.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.539
Not only is he afraid of heights,
he can dematerialize himself into dwellings.

20:48.610 --> 20:51.511
Their suspect's
mentally handicapped.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.071
If it is a pattern, yours is
the only other case in this command.

20:54.149 --> 20:58.415
I want your guy interviewed as a witness
on the possibility of a window entry.

20:58.487 --> 21:02.355
Yeah, let me go ask him. This is besides
the door he admits he busted down.

21:02.424 --> 21:05.154
I want them to run the interview, Stu.

21:10.165 --> 21:14.226
Come on, Lieutenant.
I won't get within five feet of that guy.

21:14.302 --> 21:16.736
You can be in the room.
They'll run the interview.

21:18.306 --> 21:21.673
Mr. Kasinzakas, I'm Detective Simone.
This is Detective Russell.

21:21.743 --> 21:24.405
We really appreciate
you coming in again.

21:24.479 --> 21:27.277
- Andy.
- Look, I know you've talked to...

21:27.349 --> 21:30.807
Listen, uh,
the guy moved the meet up.

21:30.886 --> 21:33.252
Then can't you use
a uniform backup?

21:33.321 --> 21:37.382
Oh, any sign of the police, and they said
that the Torah would be destroyed.

21:37.459 --> 21:39.450
If you couldjust
come back here...

21:39.528 --> 21:42.588
- Bobby, you and her got the interview?
- Yeah, uh, we got it.

21:42.664 --> 21:45.895
Detective, we guessed
that you were a 44.

21:50.105 --> 21:53.438
Have a seat.

21:53.508 --> 21:55.533
- Now everyone hits me?
- No one's gonna hit you.

21:55.610 --> 21:59.546
- And you're not a suspect at this time, Mr. Kasinzakas.
- I'm not?

21:59.614 --> 22:01.605
No, you're not.

22:04.452 --> 22:06.784
But, um, we need your help.

22:06.855 --> 22:09.585
We want to go back through
the night of the murder with you.

22:09.658 --> 22:11.990
I had too much to drink.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.620
Marina locked the door
'cause she was mad I came home so late.

22:14.696 --> 22:17.597
- You kicked the door in, and you argued?
- Yes.

22:17.666 --> 22:20.260
- And you hit her?
- I slapped her one time.

22:20.335 --> 22:22.303
- But you didn't stab her?
- Hey.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.600
We argued, and I may
have slapped her.

22:24.673 --> 22:28.268
And after we argued.
And now she was angry with the door.

22:28.343 --> 22:30.811
- Finally I fell asleep.
- Where did you fall asleep?

22:30.879 --> 22:34.280
- On the couch. - And your
wife- She fell asleep on the bed?

22:34.349 --> 22:38.308
I didn't even try to go on that bed.
I wasn't so drunk to be that stupid.

22:38.386 --> 22:42.015
- You woke up. She was dead.
- Yes, stabbed.

22:42.090 --> 22:45.025
Horrible stabbing,
all in her chest.

22:45.093 --> 22:47.323
Mr. Kasinzakas, was the window
in the bedroom open?

22:47.395 --> 22:50.489
- No.
- You sure?

22:50.565 --> 22:53.432
- It couldn't be open more than a little.
- Why?

22:53.501 --> 22:57.437
Only goes up four inches.
I fixed it 'cause of the street.

23:02.177 --> 23:04.304
I'm glad we're keeping him
a little longer...

23:04.379 --> 23:06.677
because this'll give me
the opportunity to ask him...

23:06.748 --> 23:09.512
if he saw some guy
all in white bandages...

23:09.584 --> 23:12.815
- and when the bandage unwrapped, there was no one inside.
- I've heard enough from you.

23:12.888 --> 23:15.152
Think I like being embarrassed,
taken off'cause I raised a hand?

23:15.223 --> 23:18.784
- You ever raise your hand to a perp?
- Detective Simone, please.

23:18.860 --> 23:22.728
- One moment, please. Detective?
- Give me a minute, will you?

23:22.797 --> 23:24.822
- Don't talk to me like a damn rookie.
- Stu, back off.

23:24.900 --> 23:28.392
I got the father of my suspect over there,
and I have to talk to him.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.961
All right?

23:32.774 --> 23:34.969
Yeah, sorry.

23:36.912 --> 23:40.848
- Mr. Wuthrich.
- Why is Frank still in Bellevue? Why hasn't he been charged?

23:40.916 --> 23:44.215
- Let's sit down here.
- My daughter is dead.

23:44.286 --> 23:46.914
You people are just
dragging your feet.

23:46.988 --> 23:48.922
- We're not dragging our feet.
- I was there.

23:48.990 --> 23:50.924
I found her body.

23:50.992 --> 23:53.586
- My daughter was killed by my son.
- We're not sure about that.

23:53.662 --> 23:56.825
Your son is adamant that he wasn't involved.
We haven't discovered a weapon yet.

23:56.898 --> 23:59.196
Well, who did it, Detective?

23:59.267 --> 24:02.703
If Frankie didn't do it,
who the hell did it?

24:02.771 --> 24:08.209
Sir, your daughter's body was found in proximity
to a window that was facing the street...

24:08.276 --> 24:11.211
What the hell are you talking about?
That window was not open.

24:11.279 --> 24:14.942
There was no sign of a forced entry.
That's the first thing the uniform cop told me.

24:15.016 --> 24:17.348
The window wasn't open,
but it also wasn't locked.

24:17.419 --> 24:22.356
Now, we're looking into a theory that an intruder
possibly could have gotten in and then exited.

24:22.424 --> 24:24.858
What, without her waking up,
or my son?

24:24.926 --> 24:26.951
- It is damn nonsense!
- Mr. Wuthrich.

24:27.028 --> 24:30.657
And I came home to find
my daughter butchered!

24:30.732 --> 24:33.599
And I have to live with knowing...

24:33.668 --> 24:35.966
- that I didn't get my son out of my house.
- Mr. Wuthrich...

24:36.037 --> 24:38.528
And if you think you're gonna
make a joke out of this...

24:41.943 --> 24:45.401
Look, I can't possibly know the grief
that you're going through right now...

24:45.480 --> 24:47.414
the pain that you're in.

24:47.482 --> 24:51.248
We're looking into this.
We're gonna work hard on it...

24:51.319 --> 24:53.719
and we are going to figure it out.

24:53.788 --> 24:55.779
Now, what you gotta do is...

24:55.857 --> 24:58.792
you gotta take care of yourself,
you gotta take care of your wife.

24:58.860 --> 25:00.851
Oh, sure.

25:03.231 --> 25:06.223
- No problem.
- It's a big problem. I know how big it is.

25:08.803 --> 25:10.794
Go home, Mr. Wuthrich.
I promise you...

25:10.872 --> 25:13.238
we will call you
if anything develops.

25:13.308 --> 25:15.299
Okay?

25:18.580 --> 25:21.174
Yeah.

25:28.089 --> 25:30.023
Oh, boy.

25:36.164 --> 25:40.328
I don't know if it's anything, but there's
a stop-and-frisk night of my homicide...

25:40.402 --> 25:43.337
Some twitch across from
Kasinzakas's building.

25:43.405 --> 25:45.839
- Had a scuba mask under his arm.
- Well, let's talk to this guy.

25:45.907 --> 25:47.841
Maybe he got in
through the drainpipes.

25:47.909 --> 25:50.776
- You got an address?
- Yeah.

25:58.219 --> 26:00.517
Oh, Sylvia.
Good to see you.

26:00.588 --> 26:02.579
We just finished
taking a statement.

26:02.657 --> 26:04.887
I'm gonna see if I can grab
my husband for some lunch.

26:04.959 --> 26:07.655
- Oh, he's out with Medavoy on a case.
- Oh.

26:07.729 --> 26:11.392
- So, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

26:19.307 --> 26:21.639
Hi.

26:21.709 --> 26:24.701
Detective Russell, I wanted to apologize
about canceling on that dinner.

26:24.779 --> 26:27.407
Oh, I understand completely.

26:27.482 --> 26:30.713
- You do?
- Sure. You weren't feeling well.

26:32.087 --> 26:36.046
- Hey, Sylvia. How you feelin'?
- I'm feeling fine.

26:36.124 --> 26:39.685
Uh, Andy and Greg-
They went to go pick up a perp.

26:39.761 --> 26:43.026
- You want me to tell him that you stopped by?
- No. It's nothing important.

26:44.265 --> 26:46.665
Let's go pick this guy up.

26:55.977 --> 26:58.502
This all okay?
The sideburns?

26:58.580 --> 27:00.275
The payot, Detective.
They're fine.

27:00.348 --> 27:03.215
What you need to tell us is
if everything's okay with the Torah.

27:03.284 --> 27:06.378
The rebbe explained.
I'll let you know if everything's kosher.

27:06.454 --> 27:08.012
Hasidic comedian.

27:08.089 --> 27:10.353
One of you guys
the Rabbi Lieberman?

27:10.425 --> 27:14.088
I am Rabbi Lieberman.
Uh, have you got the Torah?

27:20.101 --> 27:22.092
The yad is missing.

27:22.170 --> 27:23.865
- The what?
- The yad.

27:23.938 --> 27:26.736
It's a pointer.
It's like a silver letter opener.

27:26.808 --> 27:28.901
- Ask him where the yad is.
- Come on. Where's the cash?

27:28.977 --> 27:32.413
- The yad's not there.
- Listen, I brought the book. That was the deal.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.539
No, the deal is you return
what you took, asshole.

27:34.616 --> 27:37.278
- Are you Rabbi Lieberman?
- Just give up the pointer.

27:37.352 --> 27:40.651
Hey, hey, hey! Get him! Get him!
Greg, get him on the other side.

27:40.722 --> 27:42.383
I got him.

27:42.457 --> 27:44.891
Where's that letter opener?

27:44.959 --> 27:48.292
You stay on top of me, and those hymie boys
are never gonna see that letter opener again.

27:48.363 --> 27:50.297
- Shut up!
- What kind of rabbi are you?

27:50.365 --> 27:53.493
I'm the kind of rabbi who will wrap
his payot around your throat...

27:53.568 --> 27:58.801
and pull until I got you screaming for
God's mercy, which will not be forthcoming!

27:58.873 --> 28:01.535
Now, who are you working with?

28:01.609 --> 28:03.839
- Ramon- Ramon Iberras!
- That's the exterminator.

28:03.912 --> 28:07.143
Yeah, he's got the pointer too.
You're crazy, man!

28:07.215 --> 28:11.242
- Jesus.
- Bless you, my son.

28:17.592 --> 28:21.084
I'm glad to see my tax dollars
are being used so efficiently.

28:21.162 --> 28:25.360
Well, you know, if there's a mix-up on this,
Mr. Squires, we're gonna apologize 100%.

28:25.433 --> 28:27.424
Well, as I've never been in Virginia...

28:27.502 --> 28:31.029
let alone robbing a convenience store,
I'd say there's probably been a mix-up.

28:31.105 --> 28:33.539
Yeah, well, you know what happens
with that, Mr. Squires.

28:33.608 --> 28:36.338
Getaway car's moving fast, and people
get partial numbers on the plates.

28:36.411 --> 28:38.936
And I get dragged
into a precinct house.

28:39.013 --> 28:41.641
Well, that's our job.
You know, we gotta check these things out.

28:41.716 --> 28:44.048
Are we done?

28:44.118 --> 28:47.952
As delightful as this is, I do have another
appointment with the H.R.A. I'd rather not miss.

28:48.022 --> 28:50.354
- Oh, is that right?
- Yes, I'm withholding rent...

28:50.425 --> 28:53.724
because my landlord's standard
for building maintenance is Stalag 17.

28:53.795 --> 28:57.287
You know, I must not have noticed
all the problems when we picked you up.

28:57.365 --> 28:59.890
I notice the problems, Detective.

28:59.968 --> 29:01.959
I'm sure you don't notice
a lot of things.

29:02.036 --> 29:05.062
Well, maybe you should think
about rescheduling this H.R.A. Thing...

29:05.139 --> 29:07.630
'cause there was something else
that I wanted to ask you about.

29:07.709 --> 29:11.304
- We got a stop-and-frisk card filed on you.
- What would that be?

29:11.379 --> 29:15.645
- This is when we were checking you out on that Virginia matter.
- Which is complete boondoggle.

29:15.717 --> 29:20.051
Yeah. Anyway, I found your name on a card
that was filled out by one of our uniform cops.

29:20.121 --> 29:22.646
He questioned you about wearing
some kind of swim gear...

29:22.724 --> 29:25.522
in the street
at 3:00 in the morning.

29:25.593 --> 29:30.155
- A diving suit.
- Yes, that's right. Black rubber diving suit.

29:30.231 --> 29:32.859
- What was that about?
- What was what about?

29:32.934 --> 29:36.495
Come on, Mr. Squires. You're wearing a black
rubber outfit in the middle of the night?

29:36.571 --> 29:39.233
I am a diver.

29:39.307 --> 29:41.241
I'm also an insomniac.

29:41.309 --> 29:45.268
I was testing out some new equipment.
Where in the penal code is that listed as a crime?

29:45.346 --> 29:49.578
Well, there was a crime that was committed
that night, Mr. Squires...

29:49.651 --> 29:51.778
right in the area
where you were questioned.

29:51.853 --> 29:55.050
- What, another convenience store robbery?
- No, this is a homicide.

29:55.123 --> 29:59.457
This is a woman who was stabbed to death
in her first-floor apartment...

29:59.527 --> 30:02.428
about an hour after that cop
talked to you.

30:04.265 --> 30:06.256
You know anything about that?

30:08.269 --> 30:10.294
Yes.

30:10.371 --> 30:13.772
That's what I do.
I get dressed in my diving gear...

30:13.841 --> 30:16.139
and I go around murdering women.

30:16.210 --> 30:20.442
I do one of those a week, and then
a convenience store robbery in Virginia.

30:23.785 --> 30:26.720
- Got a girlfriend, Mr. Squires?
- That's none of your business.

30:26.788 --> 30:30.986
- Boyfriend?
- Oh, yes. That's what I am.

30:31.059 --> 30:35.621
I'm a convenience-store robbing,
repressed homosexual, homicidal maniac.

30:35.697 --> 30:39.258
You mind sticking around
while we get that Virginia paperwork?

30:39.334 --> 30:41.928
Do I have a choice?

30:42.003 --> 30:44.494
We just want to get
the paperwork cleared up.

30:46.074 --> 30:48.065
Then we won't have
to bother you anymore.

30:49.143 --> 30:51.202
That'll be a new experience.

30:58.953 --> 31:01.751
This guy is nuts.
He is definitely Iying for the homicides.

31:01.823 --> 31:05.054
- How do you want to work him?
- We gotta figure out what kind of card to turn.

31:05.126 --> 31:09.222
- Maybe we finesse his super, get a look inside his crib.
- Devious mind.

31:09.297 --> 31:11.458
- It's one of her best features.
- Thank you.

31:11.532 --> 31:14.524
- That poor bastard.
- That jerk in there?

31:14.602 --> 31:17.093
Nah, that Greek I leaned on.

31:29.550 --> 31:33.452
- New York City detectives. You know Roger Squires?
- 3B.

31:33.521 --> 31:35.682
Yeah, we know.
Can we talk to you for a minute?

31:35.757 --> 31:37.691
- What'd he do?
- He's got a small problem.

31:37.759 --> 31:41.160
Oh, just one, huh? Good.
Let him move into your building.

31:41.229 --> 31:43.789
While we were talking to him, it came out
that he doesn't like you much either.

31:43.865 --> 31:46.857
Hasn't paid rent in six months,
and he doesn't like me?

31:46.934 --> 31:49.300
He says he won't pay 'cause
you let the place run down.

31:49.370 --> 31:51.770
What am I doing here,
setting up a parachute?

31:51.839 --> 31:56.538
Well, anyways, can you give us
an idea as to his habits...

31:56.611 --> 31:59.512
- the hours he keeps- that kind of thing?
- All hours. He's a nut job.

31:59.580 --> 32:03.812
- Does he seem like a guy who would do something violent?
- Not if you saw him coming.

32:03.885 --> 32:08.481
- Do you know ifhe dates?
- Yeah, Mary Palm and her five sisters.

32:08.556 --> 32:12.788
- You're saying he doesn't date.
- If he sees women, it's only when they can't see him back.

32:12.860 --> 32:15.124
Damn, you guys really
got it in for each other, huh?

32:15.196 --> 32:19.030
I can care less what that guy says about me.
I'm gonna evict his ass anyway.

32:19.100 --> 32:23.503
Oh, yeah? Well, he says, uh,
you're not gonna be able to get him out.

32:23.571 --> 32:26.404
- What is it with all that ethnic stuff?
- What ethnic stuff?

32:26.474 --> 32:30.638
Says you're a dumb Italian, doesn't understand
the law. How'd it get so personal?

32:30.711 --> 32:32.872
- Don't understand the law, huh?
- And something about your wife?

32:32.947 --> 32:36.007
- I mean, what was that all about?
- What about my wife?

32:36.083 --> 32:40.417
Well, you know, he says she has
a mustache like a Mexican bandit.

32:40.488 --> 32:42.922
I figured there's personal bad blood
between the two of them.

32:42.990 --> 32:45.424
- You got this guy in custody?
- We're talking to him at the station.

32:45.493 --> 32:48.826
You tell that asshole when he comes back
to look for his stuff out on the street.

32:48.896 --> 32:51.524
- Come on. Take it easy.
- No, no, no. Tell him to look outside.

32:51.599 --> 32:56.229
Because my dumb guinea ass and my
Mexican bandit wife are throwing his stuff out!

32:56.304 --> 33:00.263
- He is evicted.
- Whoa. We can't watch while something like that goes on.

33:00.341 --> 33:03.868
- Did I just cooperate with you? Did I answer your questions?
- Yeah, you cooperated.

33:03.945 --> 33:06.379
You can't watch this go on?
Do me a favor.

33:06.447 --> 33:10.611
Look the other way,
because his stuff is goin'out!

33:13.287 --> 33:15.050
He's moving now!

33:21.796 --> 33:23.730
What a mess.

33:23.798 --> 33:26.892
I guess we're gonna have to pick this stuff up
or cite this guy for littering.

33:26.968 --> 33:28.959
Son of a bitch!

33:33.708 --> 33:35.801
Yeah, here he comes.

33:35.877 --> 33:38.710
Here's what we got, Lieu.
Nine knives...

33:38.779 --> 33:43.739
in homemade sheaths- all of'em bloody-
and what looks like nightstand knickknacks.

33:43.818 --> 33:47.049
So the footlocker came open
when it was thrown on the street?

33:47.121 --> 33:50.420
Absolutely. The landlord threw it out,
and it landed on the street.

33:50.491 --> 33:54.450
- Then it came open?
- That's absolutely how it could've happened.

33:54.529 --> 33:58.727
Well, how many things did the landlord
throw out before he threw out the footlocker?

33:58.799 --> 34:01.267
- About five or six.
- Where we goin' with this, Lieu?

34:01.335 --> 34:03.235
- Anything break?
- Yeah, some things broke.

34:03.304 --> 34:06.933
So the neighbors could've heard that,
could've looked out their window...

34:07.008 --> 34:09.237
could've been looking
when the footlocker came out.

34:09.310 --> 34:11.766
So did the footlocker come open,
or did you open it?

34:13.400 --> 34:17.929
It came open in the car
in front of the guy's house.

34:18.005 --> 34:22.601
Okay. So don't talk to him about
what's in there without a warrant...

34:22.677 --> 34:25.475
or until you get his consent
to open it.

34:25.545 --> 34:28.777
You got it, Lieu.

34:49.971 --> 34:52.132
Fruit of the poisonous tree,
Detective.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.998
Are you familiar
with that legal concept...

34:56.077 --> 34:59.240
excluding proceeds
of an illegal search?

34:59.313 --> 35:04.580
Your landlord just threw everything you own
out onto the street, Mr. Squires...

35:04.652 --> 35:08.952
which means us picking this up
is not illegal.

35:09.023 --> 35:11.014
But you want me
to play it supercareful?

35:11.092 --> 35:14.584
You want me to go get a warrant
and open it somewheres else?

35:14.662 --> 35:17.563
No sensible judge
will give you one.

35:17.632 --> 35:20.829
I got a whole list
of friendly judges, Squires.

35:20.902 --> 35:24.099
I bet you I hit on the first call.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.873
Now, you make me
go get a warrant...

35:28.943 --> 35:31.104
and I won't let you watch
while I open this.

35:32.346 --> 35:34.940
I'll let you listen
while the judge says I can.

35:35.016 --> 35:37.177
Then I will lock you up...

35:39.487 --> 35:41.887
and I'll open this all by myself.

35:43.825 --> 35:47.124
Congratulations.
You're about to incriminate me...

35:49.630 --> 35:53.088
but you won't understand
the significance.

35:53.167 --> 35:56.694
You don't want to understand.
You want to put me in jail.

35:56.771 --> 35:59.706
What you're gonna tell us...

35:59.774 --> 36:03.938
or what we find in this box
without you telling us...

36:04.011 --> 36:07.037
That's what's gonna decide
whether you go to jail or not.

36:26.067 --> 36:28.934
You wait on a platform...

36:29.003 --> 36:31.267
you pick a candidate
and you follow her home.

36:31.339 --> 36:34.331
Platform means what?
A subway platform?

36:34.408 --> 36:36.603
She has to have large balls.

36:36.677 --> 36:38.338
Sorry?

36:38.412 --> 36:41.438
The women you pick.
You might call them breasts.

36:41.516 --> 36:44.576
Yeah. Balls are breasts.

36:44.652 --> 36:48.247
You wait and watch
what lights go on.

36:48.322 --> 36:51.723
If it's the first floor,
and she has large balls...

36:51.792 --> 36:53.783
you have a candidate.

36:53.861 --> 36:56.352
- How do you get inside?
- Who's telling the story, Detective?

36:56.430 --> 36:59.092
I'm sorry, Roger. Sorry.

37:06.908 --> 37:09.900
You're waiting across the street
with your milk crate.

37:12.513 --> 37:15.380
When the street is empty...

37:15.449 --> 37:17.440
you cross...

37:18.653 --> 37:21.315
get up onto your milk crate...

37:21.389 --> 37:23.550
and you look into her apartment.

37:25.359 --> 37:27.623
If the window offers access...

37:27.695 --> 37:30.163
and her bed is near the window...

37:30.231 --> 37:32.222
you have a candidate.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.734
What do you mean by access?

37:34.802 --> 37:37.362
A few inches is sufficient
for a candidate.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.703
'Cause you don't go inside.

37:42.777 --> 37:45.405
You get off your milk crate...

37:45.479 --> 37:47.743
and you wait nearby.

37:49.784 --> 37:52.753
When the lights are off in the apartment
for an hour or so...

37:52.820 --> 37:54.879
with no sick light
from the television...

37:54.956 --> 37:58.687
you take your milk crate
back across the street.

37:58.759 --> 38:02.593
You set it onto its side...

38:02.663 --> 38:05.188
and you get onto it.

38:05.266 --> 38:08.758
You reach your left hand
through the window...

38:10.938 --> 38:13.270
and you feel her balls.

38:16.277 --> 38:20.543
And you feel her balls
until she stirs.

38:22.850 --> 38:24.841
When she stirs...

38:26.287 --> 38:28.755
you begin to stab her...

38:28.823 --> 38:31.792
and you stab her, and you stab her...

38:31.859 --> 38:34.191
while you're feeling her balls.

38:34.261 --> 38:36.786
St-Stabbing her and stabbing her...

38:36.864 --> 38:39.128
stabbing her balls...

38:50.478 --> 38:52.639
Were you over there last night,
Roger?

38:55.282 --> 38:57.273
Down on Seventh Street?

38:59.286 --> 39:01.277
I'm gonna need a minute.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.982
Yeah, right.

39:09.864 --> 39:12.264
Yes.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.494
Then I'll open my trunk for you.

39:16.671 --> 39:20.573
I'll explain to you the mementos
I took from each apartment.

39:22.076 --> 39:26.342
I was restricted, of course,
from what I could take.

39:26.414 --> 39:28.905
Just what I could reach
from outside.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.289
You still got
the exterminator in there?

39:46.367 --> 39:48.358
Uh, yeah.
The rabbi's on his way.

39:48.436 --> 39:51.564
I was watching the guys
from the 27 talk to Squires.

39:51.639 --> 39:55.302
Every time this guy goes for one of these jobs,
he has an orgasm.

39:55.376 --> 39:58.971
Sick bastard.
He's gonna have some sore prostate.

39:59.046 --> 40:00.707
Detectives.

40:02.183 --> 40:05.516
- Hey, Rabbi.
- Ah, yes.

40:08.255 --> 40:10.689
Gentlemen, what news?

40:10.758 --> 40:13.158
Well, Ramon says he don't know
anything about the pointer.

40:13.227 --> 40:16.025
Which is crap.
Excuse the expression.

40:16.097 --> 40:18.361
He's lookin' to cut a deal.

40:18.432 --> 40:23.802
See, we think that if he knew you wouldn't
press charges, you'd get your yad back.

40:23.871 --> 40:27.830
Oh, we're not interested
in seeing anyone jailed.

40:27.908 --> 40:30.672
All right. Well, uh,
we'll inform him of that.

40:30.745 --> 40:33.373
- Medavoy, you-you got this?
- Yeah, sure, Andy.

40:33.447 --> 40:35.847
Um, right this way.

40:35.916 --> 40:38.077
Mr. Wuthrich.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.412
We made an arrest
on your daughter's homicide.

40:41.489 --> 40:44.322
Guy confessed.

40:44.391 --> 40:47.519
- It wasn't my son?
- The guy went for a series of murders.

40:47.595 --> 40:50.428
And you're sure
he's telling the truth?

40:50.498 --> 40:54.662
He's given detailed confessions,
and he's got items from each of the crime scenes.

40:56.137 --> 40:58.605
He had an earring-
belonged to your daughter.

41:00.307 --> 41:03.708
- And Frank let him in.
- The guy reached through her window, Mr. Wuthrich.

41:03.778 --> 41:06.008
Your son didn't have
anything to do with this.

41:07.648 --> 41:10.378
She was the light of my life.

41:11.919 --> 41:13.910
He's the child that's alive.

41:13.988 --> 41:18.721
Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad, they caught
the man who killed Jenny.

41:18.793 --> 41:21.353
Yeah, yeah, he just told me.

41:21.428 --> 41:24.363
If I saw him,
I'd kick his ass so bad!

41:24.431 --> 41:27.229
There's no point in that.

41:27.301 --> 41:32.136
Anyways, we told Frank that he's free
to go home and that we're sorry for his loss.

41:32.206 --> 41:34.197
Yeah. That was my sister.

41:34.275 --> 41:38.177
There's no point in kicking
this guy's ass, I guess.

41:38.245 --> 41:42.238
No. Let's just go home.

41:54.461 --> 41:58.124
I could've kept her
from getting murdered.

41:58.199 --> 42:00.394
How were you gonna figure
your Greek guy didn't do it?

42:00.467 --> 42:03.334
Broke the door down,
history of domestic violence.

42:20.020 --> 42:23.012
- Hi, Andy.
- How ya feelin'?

42:23.090 --> 42:27.151
Feel all right. I stopped by
the station house at lunchtime.

42:28.562 --> 42:31.588
- You did?
- You were out on something with Medavoy?

42:31.665 --> 42:34.600
Ah, some stolen Torah deal.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.862
Bobby was there...

42:37.938 --> 42:41.738
and Lieutenant Fancy and that
Detective Russell you've been helpin'.

42:44.011 --> 42:46.343
You told them, didn't you?

42:46.413 --> 42:49.849
Yeah, I did.

42:51.518 --> 42:56.854
Andy, I told you.
I specifically asked you to wait.

42:56.924 --> 43:00.724
I know. I'm sorry.
I don't know what's the matter with me.

43:00.794 --> 43:03.524
You're not supposed to tell anyone
until after the first trimester.

43:03.597 --> 43:06.122
- I know. I know.
- What if something goes wrong?

43:06.200 --> 43:09.260
I know. Look,
you want me to move out?

43:09.336 --> 43:11.327
What?

43:11.405 --> 43:15.501
This baby thing- It's just so emotional-
in a good way...

43:15.576 --> 43:17.567
but I'm gonna make you nuts here.

43:17.645 --> 43:20.808
If you need some space, I could just go away
for a few days periodically and...

43:20.881 --> 43:23.315
I don't want you to go anywhere.

43:23.384 --> 43:26.046
Well, whatever you want.
If you want me to shut up...

43:26.120 --> 43:29.385
if you want me to just stand in the corner-
Just tell me what you need.

43:29.456 --> 43:32.254
You want to know
how I'm feeling now?

43:32.326 --> 43:35.227
If you want to tell me.

43:37.631 --> 43:40.429
I am very happy about this baby.

43:43.237 --> 43:45.398
And I love my husband.

43:47.207 --> 43:49.801
Well, that's good.

43:49.877 --> 43:52.038
But don't tell anyone else.

43:53.347 --> 43:57.010
I don't think I know anyone else.

44:17.071 --> 44:20.131
I just figured out
what ruined my summer.

44:20.207 --> 44:22.402
Yeah? No sex?

44:22.476 --> 44:25.274
No, you.

44:25.346 --> 44:28.179
You're having sex
with someone else?

44:28.248 --> 44:30.978
- No.
- No?

44:31.051 --> 44:34.077
No, come on, Diane.
Don't play with me about that now.

44:34.154 --> 44:36.588
- Okay?
- Okay.

44:36.657 --> 44:38.591
Sorry.

44:40.627 --> 44:43.255
You worked that guy great today.
You really did.

44:43.330 --> 44:45.389
What a sick bastard, huh?

44:45.466 --> 44:49.129
Mmm. Each confession got funkier.

44:49.203 --> 44:52.001
You should've heard the one
on the victim in the 27.

44:52.072 --> 44:54.632
- Whew. God.
- You listened to all of'em?

44:54.708 --> 44:57.074
For the interview techniques.

44:59.046 --> 45:01.446
Yeah, all right.

45:01.515 --> 45:05.645
Oh, is that all right?
Good. I feel much better.

45:05.719 --> 45:08.711
Diane. What do you expect me to say?

45:08.789 --> 45:12.020
You got same wacko who mixes
breasts up with balls...

45:12.092 --> 45:14.083
and he's stabbing women
in the chest.

45:14.161 --> 45:16.823
You expect me to be thrilled
about you hearing all that?

45:16.897 --> 45:20.799
You don't have to be thrilled, but if it gives you
problems, I expect you to deal with it.

45:20.868 --> 45:23.166
I don't want to feel guilty
for doing my job.

45:28.509 --> 45:31.342
Are we done now?

45:31.412 --> 45:34.438
- As long as you know I'm serious.
- I know you're serious.

45:34.515 --> 45:37.951
Then we're done.

45:40.687 --> 45:42.951
- Man.
- What?

45:44.158 --> 45:46.149
Women.

45:46.226 --> 45:48.694
Pretty strict there, huh?

45:48.762 --> 45:51.128
Especially the ones with balls.

45:52.800 --> 45:55.633
Hmm?
