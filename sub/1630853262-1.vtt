01:47.858 --> 01:51.904
No use crying over spilt milk!
No use crying over spilt milk!

01:51.987 --> 01:54.198
Come on, come on!

01:55.657 --> 01:58.410
Quick, quick, quick!

02:27.648 --> 02:31.443
You mucus pile.
Couldn't hide in your own house?

02:40.536 --> 02:44.540
May the Wolf-Eateress smite
the lot of you! Scram!

02:44.623 --> 02:46.625
Every last one! Out of my sight!

02:47.626 --> 02:49.419
Back to your own damn mothers!

02:51.797 --> 02:53.674
Bother them instead!

03:44.016 --> 03:46.059
Have mercy.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.812
On my blood I beg you.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.981
On my life.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.234
That is a child.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.236
You don't want the nuisance.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.119
Are you a fool, woman?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.164
As if I'd want a child?

04:08.832 --> 04:11.043
A bit of blood, that's all.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.753
A fresh-born's.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.464
I'll bring you other babies!

04:15.631 --> 04:18.300
Girls, boys. A whole pile.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.761
Only, on my sorrow,

04:22.221 --> 04:24.598
leave me my Nevena.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.477
So I can watch her grow a bit.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.022
It's a daughter you want, is it not?

04:34.816 --> 04:37.110
You're Old Maid Maria, are you not?

04:41.615 --> 04:45.661
Spend my one witching spit?

04:47.746 --> 04:49.957
On this runt?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.751
I'll give her to you grown.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.797
Let her turn 16 with me at least.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.175
Then I'll give her to you as a maiden.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.846
For what was done unto you.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.223
Under this very roof.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.351
A daughter. To serve you.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.479
So you're not alone in your old age.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.781
And?

05:23.782 --> 05:26.660
What sort of covenant
did you have in mind?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.830
One you seal with a word?

05:39.089 --> 05:42.926
The Lord! The Lord is my witness. Lord.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.475
Right, wonderful.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.228
And this scrawny thing?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.273
To get away without a mark?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.656
I think not.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.213
Don't, my chicken. Don't, my golden.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.633
No fear now.
Not with the Lord our protector.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.594
A holy place, my blood.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.804
A sacred place.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.348
She can't set one foot in here.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.743
A Wolf-Eateress!

08:13.869 --> 08:15.871
She snatched my baby girl!

08:16.788 --> 08:18.790
A Wolf-Eateress...

08:39.727 --> 08:42.022
The blue?

08:44.816 --> 08:49.071
Is it the blue that speaks?

08:52.491 --> 08:54.743
The red?

08:58.997 --> 09:04.253
The red after the moon-white?

09:08.048 --> 09:12.052
Is it? That speaks?

09:15.639 --> 09:20.561
But never to me.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.608
Never to me.

10:25.042 --> 10:28.378
But their voices...

10:31.131 --> 10:33.550
Again and again, they come back.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.724
To me, my voice...

10:44.478 --> 10:46.563
It won't come back.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.776
Never ever.

11:08.961 --> 11:11.547
Mama's puppy...

11:15.634 --> 11:17.302
My voice...

11:19.763 --> 11:23.892
The devil, she scratched it hard, so hard.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.937
When I was tiny like a fist.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.108
Mama tells me so.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.114
But I think different.

11:40.742 --> 11:44.496
I think the devil-scratch made it scared.

11:47.624 --> 11:51.920
But my voice didn't run away.

11:57.050 --> 12:01.930
It went hiding deep, deeper inside.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.517
Where no one can touch it.

12:19.198 --> 12:23.160
Do you understand
what devils prowl out there? Do you?

12:24.036 --> 12:25.996
Have I raised a fool?

12:27.831 --> 12:30.959
They would tear you to pieces
outside these walls! To pieces!

12:32.294 --> 12:34.421
You know what I went through for you?

13:04.368 --> 13:05.953
Speak.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.500
Speak to me.

13:13.544 --> 13:14.878
Their voices.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.467
Speak them to me.

13:22.344 --> 13:25.681
Or make mine nothing.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.522
Make it blacknesses.

13:37.359 --> 13:40.153
Make me blacknesses.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.148
Oh, my little chick...

15:22.673 --> 15:24.049
Stay there!

15:26.510 --> 15:28.095
You won't take her from me!

15:28.846 --> 15:29.930
No!

15:31.265 --> 15:32.349
No!

15:33.225 --> 15:34.518
You won't!

16:49.635 --> 16:51.094
Come on.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.774
Well, woman?

21:16.193 --> 21:20.697
Before me, the sky swallowed the leaves.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.622
And the martens. And the bees.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.919
And now it swallowed me.

21:46.014 --> 21:49.434
Well? You coming, or what?

22:54.791 --> 22:57.169
And Mama, it swallowed her, too.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.224
But her,

23:10.766 --> 23:14.520
it chewed her up to bits.

23:19.650 --> 23:22.736
Her voice, in blood, it thickens it.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.406
Her skin, it unclothed it.

23:29.326 --> 23:33.789
Cold... It is cold, this one.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.213
Her underskin.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.221
Drink.

24:09.116 --> 24:12.494
The sky, it chewed her up to bits.

24:15.455 --> 24:18.709
Spat out the whisper-mama bits.

24:24.965 --> 24:29.052
Witch-mama is what was left.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.642
Witch-mama and me, the witch.

24:39.563 --> 24:41.773
Me, the witch.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.627
Sometimes my wish is,

25:01.710 --> 25:04.338
"Come back, whisper-mama."

25:06.840 --> 25:08.175
Just for a little bit.

25:18.060 --> 25:22.439
But the walls,
I never want them to come back.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.860
Never ever.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.966
What do we have here?

26:19.705 --> 26:21.832
Now then, handsome.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.959
What, you don't like me like this?

26:27.546 --> 26:29.715
Look at him, the fresh lilac.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.926
And I fixed my hair just for you.

27:01.622 --> 27:03.415
Do you know anything?

27:05.501 --> 27:07.753
Were you just going to stand there?

27:09.755 --> 27:12.716
Let him cleave you in half?

27:28.315 --> 27:30.359
Come back, whisper-mama.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.583
You prefer day-old bread.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.922
A dungeon.

28:01.348 --> 28:05.561
Blood we need, woman, strength!
Not playthings.

28:11.942 --> 28:15.070
You think it would be better with her?

28:17.155 --> 28:20.409
I chose you. You.

28:22.244 --> 28:24.454
I get one witching spit.

28:25.873 --> 28:27.457
One.

28:30.419 --> 28:33.172
What a waste you are.

29:05.370 --> 29:06.663
Blood.

29:07.623 --> 29:09.666
Not playthings.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.449
What did you think me, a mother?

29:42.783 --> 29:44.493
A fool?

29:47.746 --> 29:50.123
From now on you're nothing to me.

29:50.332 --> 29:51.708
Zip.

29:54.503 --> 29:55.921
Let's see how you fare.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.701
That there, it is...

31:09.620 --> 31:11.330
Poplars.

31:16.460 --> 31:18.378
That there, it is...

31:18.629 --> 31:20.339
Sparrows.

31:25.344 --> 31:30.098
But are sparrows snakes?

31:36.313 --> 31:38.899
Are women wasps?

31:43.195 --> 31:47.074
Kisses chains?

31:54.748 --> 31:57.417
Me, am I devil?

32:22.609 --> 32:25.237
For God's sake, it's been two hours.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.751
Quick, on the ground!

32:47.217 --> 32:49.261
Back to the corn.

33:09.239 --> 33:11.783
Let's go, wife of Boris.

35:59.409 --> 36:01.411
Whoa, there.

36:03.372 --> 36:04.998
Damn, woman.

38:48.954 --> 38:51.081
What isn't strange?

38:58.922 --> 39:00.424
What isn't...

39:14.855 --> 39:17.399
...when you think about it?

40:24.591 --> 40:26.552
Daughter-in-law!

40:27.553 --> 40:30.013
What's struck you!?

40:34.977 --> 40:36.895
My, my, my...

40:39.064 --> 40:41.108
What's with you, woman?

40:41.358 --> 40:43.777
Woman madness.

40:56.206 --> 40:59.209
Don't, son. Don't, my seed.

40:59.376 --> 41:01.879
For my sake.

41:11.180 --> 41:15.475
It's no way to fight back, daughter.
This unseemliness.

41:16.977 --> 41:21.190
I know he makes it difficult.
It's not that I don't.

41:23.358 --> 41:26.486
He learned it all from his father.

41:29.489 --> 41:34.369
God smite the pair of them.

41:47.549 --> 41:48.675
Let's go.

41:49.259 --> 41:50.761
Come on, come on!

42:12.533 --> 42:15.118
My, my, my...

42:27.840 --> 42:31.844
Dear God, already! Daughter-in-law!

43:36.408 --> 43:39.494
And her speech? Gone completely?

43:42.456 --> 43:45.083
From the blows, all of it. From the blows.

44:04.770 --> 44:07.481
For the laughing, the mouth opens.

44:10.108 --> 44:13.195
And for the crying, too, the mouth opens.

44:16.156 --> 44:18.492
Only when the man is in the room,

44:21.870 --> 44:25.123
the mouth, it should never open.

44:47.521 --> 44:50.399
The man, the eye water he wants.

44:52.317 --> 44:53.902
From the woman.

44:59.616 --> 45:01.743
How far you think to take it, huh?

45:05.998 --> 45:07.791
Till all of us are a mess?

45:10.127 --> 45:12.129
Learn to keep the gob shut.

45:18.385 --> 45:20.721
To me, it won't come.

45:23.182 --> 45:25.225
The eye water.

46:14.816 --> 46:18.111
When the man is in the room,

46:20.614 --> 46:22.324
you are not a woman.

46:25.786 --> 46:29.331
You are stew. You are tea.

46:33.794 --> 46:36.004
Your place, it is inside his palm.

46:37.714 --> 46:39.675
You trickle out.

46:41.552 --> 46:45.389
Like water,
you trickle out and around him.

47:01.822 --> 47:05.367
But when you are with women in the room,

47:09.997 --> 47:14.251
your mouth, it should never stop opening.

47:18.005 --> 47:20.048
When you are with women...

47:21.717 --> 47:24.052
You are a looking-glass.

47:31.226 --> 47:33.437
When her eyebrows lift up,

47:36.231 --> 47:38.901
yours, you lift them up, too.

47:41.737 --> 47:46.617
When her eyes go wide,
yours, you make them go wide, too.

47:58.337 --> 48:00.506
To the woman, you are glass.

48:05.677 --> 48:08.013
To the man, you are water.

48:32.079 --> 48:33.622
You seen yourself?

48:37.543 --> 48:38.961
A twit.

48:39.962 --> 48:42.714
Head to toe.

48:45.175 --> 48:47.261
Everyone can see through it.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.222
As if they couldn't.

49:01.608 --> 49:04.152
But then, why should it surprise me?

49:06.864 --> 49:09.116
That you'd choose prison.

49:30.053 --> 49:31.930
What do you think?

49:33.348 --> 49:35.976
That you're the first to try this?

49:38.228 --> 49:41.481
Just wait. Just you wait.

49:43.025 --> 49:44.818
They'll tear you to pieces.

49:46.445 --> 49:48.447
To shreds.

52:39.785 --> 52:41.328
Ah, my, my...

52:44.248 --> 52:45.832
The world,

52:50.587 --> 52:54.299
it has been here so long so long.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.597
Everything

53:02.808 --> 53:05.435
means something else.

53:11.567 --> 53:13.652
And yet...

53:27.791 --> 53:29.793
And yet...

53:43.682 --> 53:45.809
What isn't strange?

54:06.830 --> 54:11.376
-Look, look, look...
-Slow down, why the hurry?

54:31.355 --> 54:34.650
That so? Then that's so.

54:37.027 --> 54:38.237
All right, man.

54:38.904 --> 54:40.656
All right.

55:58.358 --> 56:00.277
Well...

57:37.374 --> 57:40.043
Man, oh, man, oh, man...

57:50.137 --> 57:51.889
Right then.

57:55.934 --> 57:57.769
Yo, jughead.

57:58.145 --> 58:00.647
Of all the times to go stud-horsing...

58:07.362 --> 58:09.489
Got what he deserved, looks like.

58:24.630 --> 58:25.714
Come on!

58:51.615 --> 58:56.787
It's a burning, hurting thing, this world.

59:01.708 --> 59:04.753
A biting, retching thing.

59:09.925 --> 59:12.010
And yet...

59:13.846 --> 59:15.430
And yet...

59:17.057 --> 59:19.852
Come, one day without foolishness...

59:29.069 --> 59:33.574
I am a man now, and so I can do it.

59:38.579 --> 59:41.290
Go out where the grass is.

59:45.002 --> 59:46.837
Where the soil is.

59:49.715 --> 59:52.718
Clothe myself in sun.

59:56.138 --> 59:58.307
In sun like liquid.

1:00:08.192 --> 1:00:09.860
My, my, my...

1:00:39.681 --> 1:00:42.643
Brother-in-law? What are you doing?

1:00:48.774 --> 1:00:51.735
Out, spirit! Out with you this instant!

1:00:53.278 --> 1:00:55.906
Get out! Shoo, shoo!

1:00:58.242 --> 1:01:02.454
Had to take it that far.
Fornicating with a Wolf-Eateress.

1:01:02.538 --> 1:01:06.041
-She must've yanked his wits.
-Hell, his manhood with them!

1:01:06.166 --> 1:01:08.418
He always was insatiable.

1:01:09.169 --> 1:01:13.966
But would she have left him alive?

1:01:15.175 --> 1:01:18.220
She's a crafty one. A trickster.

1:01:19.054 --> 1:01:21.890
That's what's gnawing at me.

1:01:22.891 --> 1:01:26.395
A handsome one like him?

1:01:27.396 --> 1:01:30.315
She'll want seconds, damn her.

1:01:31.316 --> 1:01:33.485
You can breathe it in.

1:01:35.988 --> 1:01:40.200
The smell like dirt when it's sour.

1:01:42.995 --> 1:01:45.998
Dirt like they will bury them in.

1:01:52.045 --> 1:01:53.881
Every day now,

1:01:55.507 --> 1:01:59.428
I feel new rivers spin open inside me.

1:02:01.889 --> 1:02:05.934
Whoosh, they whoosh in.

1:02:09.521 --> 1:02:11.982
Deeper, deeper inside me.

1:02:21.700 --> 1:02:24.661
Me the skin, they will bury it.

1:02:25.996 --> 1:02:28.582
But me the witch?

1:02:30.542 --> 1:02:33.003
They can't.

1:02:37.841 --> 1:02:41.011
Unless she whose name I won't say...

1:02:41.553 --> 1:02:46.850
Maybe she can bury me.
Snuff out the spin-waters.

1:02:56.693 --> 1:03:00.030
Leave it so I am me the nothing.

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:05.327
What strangeness...

1:03:07.746 --> 1:03:09.915
Me the nothing.

1:03:20.425 --> 1:03:21.510
Come on.

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:43.073
Not much to show for it all, have you?

1:04:11.435 --> 1:04:15.063
Now, now, brother, why so shy?

1:04:17.858 --> 1:04:19.651
Let us have a look.

1:04:25.532 --> 1:04:28.827
Think you're fooling someone?

1:04:32.831 --> 1:04:35.083
Dressed in corpses?

1:04:38.462 --> 1:04:42.216
Think they see you as one of them?

1:04:44.218 --> 1:04:46.136
Just wait.

1:04:47.930 --> 1:04:50.349
Just you wait.

1:04:52.392 --> 1:04:56.438
A whole day chopping two logs...

1:04:56.522 --> 1:04:59.816
Damn pansy-ass,
I can't stand to look at you.

1:05:00.609 --> 1:05:04.821
Come on already,
I've got brandy warmed up.

1:05:08.033 --> 1:05:11.370
I don't want you upstairs
until it's all chopped.

1:06:50.177 --> 1:06:52.679
My, my, my...

1:07:14.743 --> 1:07:17.037
It can't be a lie.

1:07:20.874 --> 1:07:22.417
Can't be.

1:07:25.921 --> 1:07:27.965
The smilings...

1:07:31.051 --> 1:07:33.178
The cheek-pattings...

1:07:38.350 --> 1:07:40.477
So simple.

1:07:45.023 --> 1:07:46.817
When you know how.

1:07:50.362 --> 1:07:51.405
Man...

1:07:54.366 --> 1:07:56.743
So, so simple...

1:08:02.165 --> 1:08:06.378
There's blood all over!
The rocks over there, she fell! Run, run!

1:08:49.837 --> 1:08:51.798
So simple.

1:09:18.408 --> 1:09:20.160
Bilia!

1:09:20.327 --> 1:09:22.412
Ah, my Bilia...

1:09:23.412 --> 1:09:26.207
Bilia, darling.

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.252
You maybe broke something?

1:09:29.461 --> 1:09:32.171
-Must've bumped her head, that's all.
-Answer, Mommy.

1:09:32.256 --> 1:09:35.008
-It'll pass, it'll pass.
-Answer, child.

1:09:37.010 --> 1:09:39.136
What'd I tell you about the hair?

1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:57.823
I didn't know...

1:10:01.952 --> 1:10:03.871
I didn't know...

1:10:14.047 --> 1:10:16.884
...that it could be like this?

1:10:21.013 --> 1:10:23.098
I didn't know.

1:10:34.902 --> 1:10:38.447
The hands that light up...

1:10:39.740 --> 1:10:43.118
The voices that warm up...

1:10:49.208 --> 1:10:50.209
Fires...

1:10:55.547 --> 1:10:56.840
Fires...

1:11:02.554 --> 1:11:04.848
What soft fires.

1:11:47.724 --> 1:11:49.351
How about a Mad Marko story?

1:11:50.143 --> 1:11:51.728
No, a scary one.

1:11:52.521 --> 1:11:54.731
What, Mad Marko's not scary?

1:11:55.023 --> 1:11:56.733
Mad Marko just gets naked.

1:11:56.817 --> 1:11:59.528
You seen a man get naked?

1:11:59.611 --> 1:12:01.530
As if it's not scary.

1:12:01.655 --> 1:12:03.740
How about Lydia and the Turk?

1:12:04.575 --> 1:12:07.744
No, no, the one about Old Maid Maria!
Tell that one, Grandma?

1:12:11.206 --> 1:12:12.708
Old Maid Maria...

1:12:18.964 --> 1:12:20.591
All right.

1:12:21.967 --> 1:12:23.719
Let's go with that one, I suppose.

1:12:25.554 --> 1:12:28.348
This is something
that happened centuries ago.

1:12:29.224 --> 1:12:32.186
When the Turk was at his cruelest.

1:12:32.311 --> 1:12:36.356
Entire villages he emptied of boys.

1:12:37.232 --> 1:12:38.483
Every last boy.

1:12:39.902 --> 1:12:44.364
For Old Maid Maria,
there wasn't a bachelor left.

1:12:47.618 --> 1:12:48.911
And so,

1:12:49.828 --> 1:12:54.750
-Maria's life was like a river...
-My life is like a river.

1:12:57.169 --> 1:12:59.505
It flows and flows,

1:13:02.591 --> 1:13:04.885
and still it stays in the same spot.

1:13:18.857 --> 1:13:22.361
It's become harder to cry.

1:13:25.822 --> 1:13:27.783
Stupider, too.

1:13:41.380 --> 1:13:42.506
Maria...

1:14:56.413 --> 1:14:57.414
Wolf-Ea...

1:15:00.375 --> 1:15:02.002
Find me a husband.

1:15:05.714 --> 1:15:08.675
A husband. To give me a child.

1:15:10.010 --> 1:15:11.345
A life.

1:15:49.341 --> 1:15:51.301
Ahoy there!

1:16:00.102 --> 1:16:02.896
Someone there knows my daughter?

1:16:04.731 --> 1:16:08.485
Well, I've crossed many villages.

1:16:08.569 --> 1:16:11.613
A friend mentioned Old Maid Maria.

1:16:11.697 --> 1:16:15.409
Your son couldn't come in person?

1:16:15.492 --> 1:16:19.329
A young man to cross the woods?
With the Turk hunting rebels?

1:16:19.997 --> 1:16:22.249
Hardly wise.

1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:32.593
Your aunt can take me in, I guess.

1:17:07.419 --> 1:17:11.131
Dearie! Come, dearie.

1:17:16.011 --> 1:17:17.888
Go right ahead.

1:17:18.138 --> 1:17:20.891
Go to your betrothed.
We'll fix everything.

1:17:21.308 --> 1:17:24.186
Oh, husband, come!

1:17:24.478 --> 1:17:26.230
Go, dear.

1:17:26.563 --> 1:17:28.482
Where the hell'd you go? Come here.

1:17:44.248 --> 1:17:46.333
Come, come on...

1:17:50.087 --> 1:17:53.090
The groom is to multiply his seed.
Oh, Lord...

1:17:54.049 --> 1:17:56.510
Daughter, I beg you...

1:17:57.511 --> 1:18:01.348
Look at my boy... My only-born...

1:18:01.473 --> 1:18:06.895
You won't let him die a half-man?
Having spread no seed?

1:18:08.522 --> 1:18:13.485
Send him to God a virgin? An "un-man"?

1:18:25.789 --> 1:18:28.625
I know, daughter, I know.

1:18:28.750 --> 1:18:32.921
It's how the act is done. My, oh, my...

1:18:33.213 --> 1:18:36.925
You'll shut your eyes
for a bit and that's that.

1:18:37.217 --> 1:18:39.052
What woman does not want a baby?

1:19:02.868 --> 1:19:08.040
Oh, poor Maria, oh, our Maria...

1:19:09.082 --> 1:19:12.503
So young for a deathbed, my, my...

1:19:30.812 --> 1:19:33.148
Sister?

1:19:36.068 --> 1:19:37.986
Mother?

1:19:41.532 --> 1:19:42.908
You.

1:19:45.285 --> 1:19:47.287
You I summon.

1:19:54.503 --> 1:19:56.338
Which is the blood that heals?

1:19:59.550 --> 1:20:01.885
That keeps my death at bay?

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:09.685
I've seen nothing of life.

1:20:13.021 --> 1:20:15.065
Of the good in life.

1:20:17.609 --> 1:20:19.486
This can't be the end.

1:20:23.323 --> 1:20:24.741
Can't be.

1:20:25.450 --> 1:20:31.331
Vileness with livestock will not pass.
Witchery will not pass. Hear us, oh, Lord.

1:21:21.673 --> 1:21:24.092
Just wait.

1:21:30.057 --> 1:21:32.726
Just you wait.

1:21:50.869 --> 1:21:54.206
It's a burning, breaking thing.

1:21:58.877 --> 1:22:00.337
This world.

1:22:07.010 --> 1:22:10.556
A biting, retching thing.

1:22:16.895 --> 1:22:18.438
And yet...

1:22:23.527 --> 1:22:25.612
And yet...

1:22:42.588 --> 1:22:44.548
Bilia!

1:22:50.679 --> 1:22:52.431
The years?

1:22:55.684 --> 1:22:58.228
Leaves in a flurry.

1:23:00.522 --> 1:23:02.649
Lashing the cheek.

1:23:09.531 --> 1:23:12.576
Man, oh, man, oh, man...

1:23:29.301 --> 1:23:32.471
My, oh, my...

1:23:33.430 --> 1:23:39.144
-Poor pansy-ass.
-Bit of blood and he's sniffling!

1:24:25.190 --> 1:24:28.110
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy...

1:24:37.494 --> 1:24:39.538
Every me.

1:24:42.958 --> 1:24:44.877
Every last me.

1:24:47.296 --> 1:24:49.006
Me the woman...

1:24:50.757 --> 1:24:52.593
Me the witch...

1:24:55.721 --> 1:25:00.767
Me the bees buzzing in my bowels.

1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:15.073
Every me. Every last me.

1:25:35.427 --> 1:25:36.929
He'll find you out.

1:25:44.937 --> 1:25:47.773
Throw you in the fire himself.

1:26:15.384 --> 1:26:17.344
It's you then, Yovan dear.

1:26:26.103 --> 1:26:29.273
So be it then. Bugger it.

1:26:29.398 --> 1:26:31.984
-Cheers?
-Cheers.

1:27:34.421 --> 1:27:36.507
Yovan hon, come.

1:27:37.090 --> 1:27:39.343
Give that.

1:27:41.345 --> 1:27:44.556
Come on, man, stand here!

1:27:47.601 --> 1:27:50.854
Higher. Higher, damn it. A bit more...

1:27:51.813 --> 1:27:54.316
Keep going, keep going.

1:27:54.983 --> 1:27:59.530
Once more. Three times all up, yeah?

1:27:59.655 --> 1:28:02.032
I wasn't counting, were you counting!?

1:28:02.157 --> 1:28:06.370
Come again, from the beginning.
One, two, three...

1:28:06.495 --> 1:28:09.623
And where's the damn boy for the blessing?

1:28:50.747 --> 1:28:55.377
Daughter, there's to be no shame here.

1:28:57.337 --> 1:29:00.799
Yours is to serve a husband's will.

1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:06.722
Where he wants to slip himself in,
you're to let him in.

1:29:06.847 --> 1:29:09.516
No shame. None of that.

1:29:09.683 --> 1:29:12.269
But no relish neither!

1:29:12.352 --> 1:29:16.273
A virgin bride? To show relish?

1:29:16.356 --> 1:29:18.233
It's just not done.

1:29:18.442 --> 1:29:21.028
It baffles a husband.

1:29:28.577 --> 1:29:32.331
Come on, come on! Enough!

1:30:20.504 --> 1:30:21.880
Man...

1:30:26.343 --> 1:30:28.554
Every me...

1:30:31.390 --> 1:30:34.726
Every last me thirsts

1:30:36.311 --> 1:30:38.522
for every him.

1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:45.863
Only not the skin-flesh him.

1:30:49.700 --> 1:30:53.245
Him the boy inside.

1:30:56.206 --> 1:31:00.169
Him the boy with the eyes...

1:31:03.297 --> 1:31:05.883
The eyes that look scared,

1:31:07.718 --> 1:31:10.387
even when they're smiling.

1:31:14.391 --> 1:31:16.435
It's that boy.

1:31:17.227 --> 1:31:23.150
Him I want to put my arms around.

1:31:25.903 --> 1:31:29.489
To hold him. To hold him.

1:31:33.994 --> 1:31:37.581
Chase the scaredness away.

1:33:52.216 --> 1:33:54.593
God damn...

1:33:56.595 --> 1:33:58.222
Where's your husband?

1:33:58.347 --> 1:34:01.183
Must have lost his way
from the bedspread to the loft.

1:35:50.292 --> 1:35:53.504
It's her that brought on this evil.
Is it not?

1:35:55.881 --> 1:35:57.216
All her fault.

1:35:57.299 --> 1:35:59.468
God damn, enough already.

1:35:59.968 --> 1:36:01.303
The dewy bride!

1:36:05.599 --> 1:36:07.851
We have to, all of us.

1:36:09.770 --> 1:36:13.774
Or else it won't take. The cleansing.

1:36:17.611 --> 1:36:20.822
Don't mind these fools babbling on.

1:36:21.949 --> 1:36:24.326
You're ours. We all know it.

1:36:29.831 --> 1:36:32.125
The Wolf-Eateress...

1:36:32.876 --> 1:36:35.587
She rages with envy,

1:36:35.671 --> 1:36:40.342
rages since always.

1:37:08.161 --> 1:37:10.581
Bit more...

1:37:15.544 --> 1:37:17.129
Get them back here!

1:37:17.254 --> 1:37:20.507
Watch and learn, I said!

1:37:29.725 --> 1:37:34.855
-A female. Alas.
-The swineherd's wife. Her damn evil eye.

1:37:36.023 --> 1:37:39.902
-Hang on, darling.
-Daughter, what's with you?

1:37:40.110 --> 1:37:42.821
-Sit down!
-Leave it, leave that!

1:37:47.618 --> 1:37:50.996
Give it here. Give the baby!

1:37:51.079 --> 1:37:53.290
The spirits, woman, the evil spirits!

1:38:07.429 --> 1:38:09.056
Bilia?

1:38:10.390 --> 1:38:13.602
Is she not precious to us, too?

1:38:16.271 --> 1:38:19.399
Would we let something harm her?

1:38:20.317 --> 1:38:22.903
You need rest, child.

1:38:23.445 --> 1:38:26.782
That's right. Strength.

1:38:27.991 --> 1:38:30.285
Just an hour or so.

1:38:32.996 --> 1:38:35.290
I'll stay right here.

1:38:38.043 --> 1:38:40.128
I'll guard.

1:40:06.924 --> 1:40:08.634
And?

1:40:10.469 --> 1:40:12.304
This runt?

1:40:14.932 --> 1:40:17.184
So it came from your innards.

1:40:22.731 --> 1:40:24.399
So?

1:40:25.567 --> 1:40:27.444
What's so good about it?

1:42:08.086 --> 1:42:12.049
How was it so simple for you?

1:42:15.427 --> 1:42:17.471
How?

1:44:27.351 --> 1:44:29.228
And yet...

1:44:32.731 --> 1:44:34.399
And yet...
