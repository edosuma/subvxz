hit a car?

Well, that's where the--
"hmm, mmm-mmm" come in.
What?

04:56.428 --> 05:00.064
You told me never
to say those two words.

05:01.133 --> 05:03.534
Edith, what are you
trying to tell me,

05:03.602 --> 05:07.405
that you hit a car
with a can of cling peaches?

05:07.472 --> 05:11.609
That's-- that's right.
You see, I was comin'
out of the market...

05:11.676 --> 05:15.246
With my shopping basket
full of "hmm, mmm-mmm,"

05:18.951 --> 05:22.921
and-- and there was Mrs. Duncan
with her new baby.

05:22.988 --> 05:26.925

but I couldn't see
the baby too well.

will you get on with the story?

Well, anyway, I knew
I had to say somethin'
nice about the baby,

05:34.666 --> 05:38.736
so I went, "oh, isn't that
a beautiful baby?"

05:38.804 --> 05:43.041
And when I went, "oh,"
the shopping basket
got away from me,

05:43.108 --> 05:48.046
rolled down the hill and
smashed into this parked car
and scratched the Fender.

05:48.113 --> 05:53.351
And then this can
of "hmm, mmm-mmm"...

05:53.419 --> 05:56.287

Suppose you find 30, 40 cents
in the little coin trough there.

got to do with anything?

to the phone company.
There. You hear that?

It may not belong
to the phone company.
That's enough.

is, I'd keep the 40 cents.

a-- a person. It's a thing.

you'd take the money.

do that. The government
expects you to do that.

are basically honest do certain
dishonest things because...

pretty soon they wind up

Well, maybe it was
the heavy syrup.

12:29.581 --> 12:32.516
Do me a favor and
stifle yourself, huh?

12:32.584 --> 12:36.286
This was all your fault,
like a dope, leavin'
your name there.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.623
- She did the right thing.
- I don't want any sermons
from you, meathead.

12:39.691 --> 12:43.494
All I want is your help
when this guy majeski gets here.
Why me?

12:43.562 --> 12:46.797
Because one polack
feels comfortable
with another one.

12:46.865 --> 12:49.567
First of all,
it's "Polish,"
and second of all,

12:49.634 --> 12:52.903
how do you know
the guy's not, uh,
Russian or Jewish?

12:52.971 --> 12:55.339
Oh, no.
He ain't Jewish.
Well, how do
you know?

12:55.407 --> 13:00.578
Because his name's John.
The hebes don't name their kids
"John." Never.

13:03.014 --> 13:07.351
Maybe he changed
no, no. His name.
Edith, Edith,
they never do.

13:07.419 --> 13:12.523
They only change the last name.
That way they know each other.
You see what I mean?

13:12.591 --> 13:14.525
Two guys are goin'
down the street, right?

13:14.593 --> 13:19.229
One says, "how are you?
My name is Smith, <i>Morris</i> Smith."
See how it works?

13:19.297 --> 13:22.433
Like you got <i>Saul</i> Nelson,
<i>Izzy</i> Watson--

13:22.501 --> 13:24.435
<i>Abe</i> Lincoln.

13:32.110 --> 13:36.046
I didn't know
Lincoln was Jewish.

13:42.821 --> 13:46.490
Don't argue with me,
please, any of youse.

13:46.558 --> 13:50.528
Don't you see we all
gotta stick together here
so we can stop this crook.

13:50.595 --> 13:54.197
Wait a minute. I got an idea.
If this guy's dishonest,
he's gonna lie. And if he lies,

13:54.265 --> 13:57.134
he's gonna get mixed up
and give himself away
and that's how we catch him.

13:57.201 --> 14:00.304
Isn't that exciting?
Once, on <i>Perry Mason--</i>

14:00.371 --> 14:02.706
will you stifle
yourself.

14:02.774 --> 14:04.708
That ain't
gonna work.
Why not?

14:04.776 --> 14:07.411
Because how're we gonna
catch him in a lie?
He tells us one story here,

14:07.479 --> 14:09.413
he goes to court,
he tells another story.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.416
- It's our word against his.
- That was
Perry Mason's problem.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.585
The jewel thief lied,

14:14.653 --> 14:18.989
but della street
had a tape recording
where the thief confessed.

14:19.057 --> 14:22.359
Ma, please.
Hold it.
Don't interrupt your mother.

14:22.427 --> 14:25.095
You was makin' sense there
for a minute, Edith.

14:25.163 --> 14:28.966
Let's hear
the rest of it.
Well, the man lied,

14:29.033 --> 14:33.771
and della street said,
"here is a tape recording
of the whole confession,"

14:33.839 --> 14:35.973
and Perry Mason
jumped up.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.978
That's when he was
playing Perry Mason.
Now he's "ironsides" and...

14:46.485 --> 14:49.419
He don't jump up
no more.

14:53.758 --> 14:56.026
All right, Edith.
That's just fine.

14:56.094 --> 15:00.430
You gave me my idea.
All right, meathead, go up
and get your tape recorder.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.432
What are you gonna do,
start playin'
Attorney General?

15:02.501 --> 15:04.802
Don't argue with me, huh?
Just get the tape recorder.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.837
Are you gonna
tell this man you're
taping his conversation?

15:06.905 --> 15:09.139
Does j. Edgar hoover
tell anybody?

15:09.207 --> 15:13.243
If you don't tell him you're
taping, then you're depriving
him of his civil rights.

15:13.311 --> 15:18.382
He ain't colored. He's Polish!
What's civil rights
got to do with Polish?

15:18.449 --> 15:22.386
<i>Arch, you're violating</i>
<i>his rights under</i>
<i>the first amendment.</i>

15:22.453 --> 15:25.155
Who's side are you
on, anyhow, huh?
Look at me.

15:25.223 --> 15:29.560
I know I got a lot goin'
against me: I'm white, I'm
protestant, I'm hardworkin'.

15:29.628 --> 15:33.230
Can't you find one lousy
amendment to protect me?

15:33.297 --> 15:35.699
<i>[ Door buzzer</i>
<i> </i> <i>sounding ]</i>
<i>There he is now.</i>

15:35.767 --> 15:37.668
Gloria, we'll clear the table.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.670
You get your
tape recorder.
I'll get the door.

15:39.738 --> 15:43.173
No. If you can't do
what I want you to do,
then don't do nothin'. Sit down.

15:43.241 --> 15:45.175
All right.
Youse two, get away
from that table there.

15:45.243 --> 15:48.012
<i>Come over here</i>
<i>and stand here.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

15:48.079 --> 15:50.814
Get over here. Right there.
Now, youse, stand there!

15:50.882 --> 15:52.816
<i>[ Buzzer ]</i>
<i>Sit down there,</i>

15:52.884 --> 15:55.753
meathead.

15:55.820 --> 15:57.755
Now, I'll answer
the door.

15:57.822 --> 16:00.524
Dummy up there,
meathead.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.927
I'll handle
this here swindler.

16:07.165 --> 16:09.232
Uh, I'm John majeski.

16:22.513 --> 16:24.915
You're kiddin'.

16:24.983 --> 16:28.418
N-no. No. I'm--
I'm father John majeski.

16:30.555 --> 16:32.489
Uh, may--
may I come in?

16:32.557 --> 16:35.258
Yeah, yeah.
Come on in, father.
Sure. Come on.

16:35.326 --> 16:38.395
You can meet the family here.
That's my wife, Edith there.
How do you do?

16:38.463 --> 16:40.998
My daughter,
Gloria here.
Hello.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.634
There's my son-in-law,
Mike stivic over here.

16:43.702 --> 16:47.270
Still want
the tape recorder, arch?
Dummy up, will you?

16:47.338 --> 16:49.272
Well, I'm delighted
to meet you,
Mrs. bunker.

16:49.340 --> 16:53.744
You know, leaving that note
on my car when you really didn't
have to is a Christian act.

16:53.812 --> 16:55.746
Are you a catholic?
No.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.482
Oh. Well, all right.

16:59.918 --> 17:02.853
Uh, may I-- may I sit down?
Yeah. Go ahead.
Sit down.

17:02.921 --> 17:06.723
Sit down there,
father, but don't
sit in the-- oh.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.726
Go on.
You sit down.
[ Sighs ]

17:08.792 --> 17:10.728
Well, that's better.
What a day. What a day.

17:10.795 --> 17:13.396
I-I haven't stopped
for a minute. I've been
on the go all day.

17:13.464 --> 17:17.334
Lately things are beginning to
pile up. You know, Mrs. bunker,
I have a confession to make.

17:17.401 --> 17:21.238
[ Gasps]
I always wanted
to know how that worked.

17:28.012 --> 17:32.382
Uh, what? Oh, I-- oh, I--
"make a con--" oh, that's
very funny. That's very funny.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.384
You have a delicious
sense of humor.

17:34.452 --> 17:39.189
She has a delicious
sense of humor.
Yeah, she's awful funny.

17:39.257 --> 17:42.192
Uh, Mike, uh, may I
have a word or two
with you in private?

17:42.260 --> 17:44.194
Just step
in the kitchen here.
Yeah, sure.

17:44.262 --> 17:47.698
Uh, I suppose you'll excuse us,
father?
Oh, yes, indeed.
Yes, indeed.

17:47.766 --> 17:52.369
"Make a confession." Oh, I say,
I must remember that one. I must
tell that one to the bishop.

17:52.436 --> 17:56.540
That ought to bring a smile
to his face. He hasn't
smiled very much lately,

17:56.607 --> 18:02.312
what with father Donovan
being secretly married
for seven years,

18:02.380 --> 18:06.316
father callan, poor soul,
sitting in jail,

18:06.384 --> 18:09.086
something to do
with leaflets.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.254
What are you doin'?
What is it?
Come here.
Come here.

18:11.322 --> 18:13.256
I think
we're in luck.
What?

18:13.324 --> 18:16.694
This guy is a phony.
How do you know that?

18:16.761 --> 18:18.696
Don't you never
read the papers...

18:18.763 --> 18:23.200
About all them
unflocked priests
runnin' around, huh?

18:23.267 --> 18:29.173
This priest here
ain't kosher,
and he never was.

18:29.240 --> 18:33.376
How do you know?
Did you see the lousy-lookin'
suit he's wearin' there?

18:33.444 --> 18:35.579
So what, arch? Maybe it's
the only suit he owns.

18:35.646 --> 18:38.448
Are you kiddin'?
The catholic church owns
half the property in New York,

18:38.516 --> 18:41.451
including some of your
finest clothing stores.

18:41.519 --> 18:44.621
Arch, if you have any doubts,
why don't you just ask him
for his credentials?

18:44.689 --> 18:47.057
Aw, come on. How the hell
are you gonna do that?
Oh, simple. You just walk up...

18:47.125 --> 18:50.127
To him and say, "father,
can I see your cross?"

18:57.035 --> 18:59.970
Get out of here.
Good-bye.

19:02.073 --> 19:04.274
[ Majeski ]
Yes, well, we have a very
poor parish. We have to make...

19:04.342 --> 19:08.712
Every penny count, what with
the painting and the fixing
and the paperwork.

19:08.780 --> 19:12.783
I-I haven't hardly
time enough for God,
much less my parishioners.

19:12.851 --> 19:16.386
You know, lately, sitting in
the confessional, when I should
be listening with patience...

19:16.454 --> 19:22.226
And understanding, I-I find
myself thinking, "oh, come on.
Come on. Let's get on with it."

19:24.028 --> 19:27.164
Uh, say, uh, [ Clears throat ]
Father there, uh, I'd like
to ask you somethin'.

19:27.232 --> 19:32.770
Uh-- uh, the other night
down at kelcy's bar we was,
uh, discussin' the Bible--

19:32.837 --> 19:36.774
uh, you know, it sometimes
comes up between beers--

19:38.609 --> 19:43.080
and, uh, the boys and me,
we was arguin' about
the words to the, uh,

19:43.148 --> 19:45.082
23rd psalm.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.717
I was wonderin'
if you could help us out
as long as you're here.

19:47.786 --> 19:52.389
Ah, yes. 23rd psalm. Ah, um--
well, I know it so well.

19:52.456 --> 19:54.357
I figured you should.

19:54.425 --> 19:57.394
Uh-h-h-- ah!

19:57.461 --> 19:59.396
No. That's not it.

19:59.463 --> 20:01.398
Uh, 23rd psalm?

20:01.465 --> 20:06.670
- Yeah. Two-three.
- I don't seem to be able to
remember anything these days.

20:06.737 --> 20:10.874
- "The lord is my Shepherd--"
- who asked you?

20:10.942 --> 20:14.644
Oh, well, that's <i>your</i> 23rd.
That's our 22nd.

20:14.712 --> 20:16.880
Oh, yes. "Lord is my Shepherd,"
"shall not want--"
[ Edith ] That's it.

20:16.948 --> 20:20.117
Oh, and, uh, father,
you know, uh, everybody
knows, uh, them words,

20:20.185 --> 20:24.054
but the boys and me
was arguin' about
the Latin words.

20:24.122 --> 20:26.056
Oh. Well, ah-h-h,

20:26.124 --> 20:30.760
[ speaking Latin ]

20:30.829 --> 20:33.763
Uh, have we come to the word
in question, Mr. bunker?

20:33.832 --> 20:35.966
Well, uh--

20:36.034 --> 20:40.470
uh,
[ Latin ]

20:40.538 --> 20:43.473
Yeah.
[ Latin ]
Perfect.

20:46.010 --> 20:51.215
You know, Mrs. bunker, I wish we
could just forget all about--
still think he's not a priest?

20:51.282 --> 20:55.953
Maybe he is a priest, but if
he's still after my 197 bucks,
he's as crooked as the next guy.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.288
Oh, come on.
I'll find out.

20:58.356 --> 21:01.058
I've been forgetting the most
important thing: People.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.793
Uh, say, uh,
[ Clears throat ]
Father there,

21:03.862 --> 21:07.797
uh, not that I want to be
unfriendly or anything
like that, but, uh,

21:07.866 --> 21:10.033
what are you
trying to pull?

21:12.103 --> 21:14.604
Uh, I-I'm afraid
I don't understand.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.974
Yeah. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, a priest
doin' what you're doin'.

21:17.041 --> 21:19.409
W-what are you
talking about?
Oh, I know. Everybody does it.

21:19.477 --> 21:23.247
Yeah, like, uh,
cheatin' on the phone company,
chiselin' on your income taxes,

21:23.314 --> 21:28.285
but you, a man of the cloth,
hidin' behind your hassock,

21:28.353 --> 21:33.490
comin' here tryin' to
turn a dent in a Fender
into a pot o' gold.

21:33.557 --> 21:36.159
Mr. bunker, do you mean
to imply--
I mean that I ain't makin'...

21:36.227 --> 21:39.229
No donations
to no catholic charities.

21:39.297 --> 21:42.099
Well, the only way
I can answer that, Mr. bunker,
is to quote from the scripture.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.101
"Go from the presence
of the foolish man...

21:44.168 --> 21:46.836
When thou perceivest not
in him the lips of knowledge."

21:46.905 --> 21:51.975
- What does that mean?
- It means, "don't waste your
time arguing with an idiot."

21:58.482 --> 22:02.185
Well, I'll be on my way
just as soon as
you pay the bill.
The bill?

22:02.253 --> 22:06.456
The bill you can send on
to the pope, who's got
more money than God.

22:06.524 --> 22:09.927
- Archie!
- It's a well-known fact.

22:09.994 --> 22:13.596
Let's-- let's not have
any more words about this,
Mr. bunker. I'll, uh,

22:13.664 --> 22:15.598
I'll take care
of it myself.

22:15.666 --> 22:19.702
Father, all that money.
It's not so much money.
It's only $14.

22:19.770 --> 22:22.039
What do you mean
only $14?

22:22.106 --> 22:24.374
Then why did the garage
tell daddy 197?

22:24.442 --> 22:27.444
- Sh-h-hush!
- You called the garage?

22:27.511 --> 22:30.948
Yes. He did,
and they told him
$197.
Yeah.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.617
Oh-h-h. I see what's
been troubling you.

22:34.685 --> 22:38.355
Look. I was having
an engine overhaul
for $183,

22:38.423 --> 22:40.824
the damage your wife
caused was $14,

22:40.891 --> 22:42.826
that's $197.

22:42.893 --> 22:46.596
The parish is so broke
the bishop was going
to pay the 183,

22:46.664 --> 22:50.000
but since you seem...
Unwilling to assume your
responsibilities, Mr. bunker,

22:50.068 --> 22:52.936
I suppose I'll--
I'll have to pay
the rest,

22:53.004 --> 22:54.938
take it out of
my own pocket.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.940
Good night.

22:57.008 --> 23:00.143
Archie, we can afford $14.
Oh, all right. All right.
All right. Leave me alone.

23:00.211 --> 23:02.145
Hey, hey,
father, uh,

23:02.213 --> 23:04.781
uh, I suppose if it's only,
uh, $14, I can make it.

23:04.849 --> 23:06.783
No, no, no. Please--

23:06.851 --> 23:11.488
please, Mr. bunker, I--
I don't want your money.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.333
However,

23:30.808 --> 23:35.445
I'll take that $14 and make
a donation in your name
to catholic charities.

23:36.514 --> 23:38.448
Oh.

23:38.516 --> 23:40.450
Yeah. Well, um,

23:40.518 --> 23:42.785
I only got a five
and a ten here, father.

23:42.853 --> 23:44.787
I've got a dollar.

23:48.826 --> 23:52.262
Good night.
Good night.
[ Edith ]
Good night, father.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.264
Good-bye,
father.
So long.

24:03.141 --> 24:05.808
What's the matter,
daddy? Don't you
feel well?

24:05.876 --> 24:08.545
Oh, he's all right.
Just a little
indigestion.

24:08.612 --> 24:11.114
Comes from eating
his own words.

24:18.122 --> 24:20.290
Here's your
dessert, Archie.

24:20.358 --> 24:22.625
Yeah, all right, Edith.
Leave it there.

24:22.693 --> 24:25.062
What do you got,
anyway?

24:35.139 --> 24:38.575
Oh, a nice big bowl
of "mm-hmm."

24:41.512 --> 24:43.447
Take it away, huh?

24:56.794 --> 24:59.229
