WEBVTT

01:58.248 --> 02:00.207
The other side of the world.

02:01.599 --> 02:04.124
I wonder if I've gone
far enough.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.997
Perhaps it's as my father said.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.347
"No matter how far you run,

02:10.434 --> 02:13.002
you can never
escape yourself."

03:19.547 --> 03:21.766
This is it?
There's nothing here.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.725
It's unknown, Arthur.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.944
Everything's here.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.512
-Do we claim it for England?
-You go on ahead, Charley.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.951
You've wasted
your inheritance, cousin.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.562
Exactly as your
father predicted.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.175
Subu says Borneo's got Malay
princes and Dayak headhunters.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.221
Yes, precisely.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.526
And pirates.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.442
I should like
to meet a pirate.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.793
I wouldn't go in there alone.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.317
If something happens,

03:50.404 --> 03:52.884
there's no Royal Navy
coming to save us.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.539
Charley!

03:55.626 --> 03:57.237
Unload the boat.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.501
Charley, come on.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.982
-Here, take this.
- Whoo!

04:23.698 --> 04:25.221
Beautiful.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.039
Charley. Bird-wing butterfly.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.223
Subu.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.139
We may as well
take tea here.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.664
Yes, Tuan.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.956
-

05:55.746 --> 05:57.531
Put it away, Arthur.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.143
Tribes around here
are friendly.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.363
Yes.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.452
I can see that.

06:27.517 --> 06:30.215
How long must one
smoke the heads?

06:46.493 --> 06:48.408
He says until the eyes melt.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.427
We are to be brought
to Prince Bedruddin,

07:07.514 --> 07:08.906
who will decide.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.387
Decide what, exactly?

07:34.149 --> 07:36.107
I am Prince Makota,

07:36.194 --> 07:39.110
the Governor of Sarawak.

07:39.197 --> 07:43.767
And my cousin, Prince Bedruddin,
the emissary of the Sultan.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.864
Do all English lords
speak the language of God?

07:53.951 --> 07:56.650
I had a good teacher.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.130
He said God speaks
in all languages.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.002
If only men will listen.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.705
-When the Sultan dies...
-Yeah.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.794
...one of them will become
the Sultan of Brunei.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.060
Allow me to introduce my cousin.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.236
Colonel Arthur Crookshank,

08:18.323 --> 08:19.977
of Her Majesty's army.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.370
Good afternoon.

08:21.457 --> 08:23.633
Do you come on behalf
of England?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.070
I come on behalf of Her Majesty,
Queen Victoria,

08:26.157 --> 08:29.944
whose empire is so vast
the sun never sets upon it.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.956
Our Dayaks are simple farmers.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.436
They have never seen
a White man.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.655
No.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.006
But you have.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.355
My cousin and I,

08:50.442 --> 08:53.054
we were paid
five English sailors

08:53.141 --> 08:55.709
as tribute by Lanun raiders.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.494
From these Englishmen,
we have your words.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.415
If you know our Quran

09:06.502 --> 09:09.897
then you know that we must
leave you now and pray.

09:10.811 --> 09:11.986
Charmed.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.640
Just back away.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.250
Back away...

09:39.404 --> 09:40.841
Don't worry, Charley.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.930
I doubt they'll hurt us.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.454
They think we're emissaries
of the queen.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.283
The queen doesn't know
we're here.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.285
They don't know that.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.982
Patience, cousin.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.854
Statecraft.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.247
Is that what
brings you here, Lord Brooke?

09:56.334 --> 09:57.597
Statecraft?

09:57.684 --> 09:59.555
Or empire?

10:01.122 --> 10:02.950
Neither, Sire.

10:03.037 --> 10:06.867
We are on a voyage of discovery,
not conquest.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.999
Then you are most welcome.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.436
I thank you.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.439
Might I be allowed
to go upriver...

10:15.919 --> 10:18.269
take specimens of plants
and animals?

10:34.503 --> 10:36.461
We will escort you
and your lords

10:36.548 --> 10:38.942
to the Orang Kaya's village.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.249
I, too, grant you permission.

10:44.078 --> 10:47.211
How long till they
figure out that I'm a fraud?

10:49.344 --> 10:51.215
I failed at school.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.043
The army.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.089
Even marriage.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.744
I can only hope to make
some great discovery here

10:57.831 --> 11:01.356
that will bring credit
to my family's name

11:01.443 --> 11:05.186
in a way that my conduct
in England did not.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.208
God, this is paradise.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.216
What's that smell, sir?

11:36.870 --> 11:38.915
Hey, look. Hey!

11:40.047 --> 11:41.222
Hey, look!

11:44.834 --> 11:46.183
Lanun Raiders.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.968
Pirates.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.448
Protected by the rebel lords
who raid our villages.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.712
It's a plague to our country.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.539
Well, there you have it.
Pirates.

11:54.626 --> 11:58.630
I'd like to see for myself.
Let's take a closer look.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.632
Why? There's nothing there.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.635
Draw the birds.
They're beautiful.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.986
I beg your pardon, my prince.

12:06.073 --> 12:09.119
Our purpose here
is to see and to record.

12:11.295 --> 12:12.819
Very well, then.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.512
Charley.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.210
James, look.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.602
By that tree.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.169
I'll get him, sir.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.525
Got him, sir.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.878
Charley, bring him here.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.067
He says, "I'm not a murderer."
Snake People...

13:27.154 --> 13:28.590
Murderer. Look at his hands.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.070
Liar.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.123
It's all right.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.970
Good. You caught one.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.842
We don't know that.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.017
He was hiding.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.409
Of course, hiding.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.455
We must stop this...

14:08.325 --> 14:09.500
chaos.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.241
Is that the word?

14:11.328 --> 14:13.243
Yes. That's the word.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.290
To stop this,
we must take the rebel fort.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.860
We understand your vessel
has many cannons, Lord Brooke.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.950
Enough to defend ourselves,
Sire, yes.

14:24.037 --> 14:27.083
We would like to see
these cannons.

14:29.912 --> 14:33.394
What do these smiling
princes want from me?

14:35.004 --> 14:37.180
The last time I killed
for an empire,

14:37.267 --> 14:39.617
the British left me for dead.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.405
I should turn back,
set sail.

14:44.492 --> 14:47.582
Instead, I find myself
sucked deeper upriver,

14:47.669 --> 14:50.280
like the current truckling
at roots of trees

14:50.367 --> 14:52.979
to drown the unwary
in its murk.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.070
But I do not resist.

14:57.157 --> 15:00.116
For here, I am a stranger,
even to myself.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.828
My Lord Brooke.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.570
You've brought a good omen.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.267
The bird tells them

16:04.354 --> 16:06.661
the man with the curious
white skin is a good spirit,

16:06.748 --> 16:07.923
and not an evil one.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.751
They don't know you like I do.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.758
My father says,
meet my sisters.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.368
- Charley.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.066
They're his daughters.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.632
No, no, no. No problem.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.286
My sisters are not yet married.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.201
Can lie as much as they wish.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.377
-You want?
- It's Dayak custom.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.597
His daughters can have
relations with anyone,

16:29.684 --> 16:31.120
but only before marriage.

16:31.207 --> 16:34.080
In England,
women do not lay up with men

16:34.167 --> 16:35.385
before they marry?

16:35.472 --> 16:37.692
Not if they get caught.

16:37.779 --> 16:41.043
Ah. Now I know why
you come to Sarawak.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.702
My cousin, Fatima.

16:47.789 --> 16:51.010
Entrusted to Orang Kaya
as pawalian

16:51.097 --> 16:53.055
for his loyalty to us.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.231
A hostage.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.580
A ward.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.756
To raise as his daughter.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.803
Captain James Brooke.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.850
Allah reserves the beautiful one
for a king.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.505
But you may have anyone else
you desire.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.336
A shave, I think.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.259
Very beautiful.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.396
Beau-ti-ful.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.093
Yes.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.703
Beautiful.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.317
Happy to meet you.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.070
My sister Fatima says,

17:51.157 --> 17:52.897
"Your Semingat is very strong."

17:52.984 --> 17:55.074
Do you have many sons?

17:55.944 --> 17:57.380
No.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.166
Well, yes.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.907
One.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.998
My sister asks, where is he?

18:08.043 --> 18:09.566
With his mother.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.400
Ah, my Lord.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.534
What is Semingat?

18:20.621 --> 18:22.405
Semingat?

18:22.492 --> 18:25.800
A king's power comes from
his Semingat.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.237
His life force.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.978
Vitality.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.981
Measured with wives, sons,

18:33.068 --> 18:37.203
slaves, heads, conquests.

18:38.726 --> 18:42.556
And all of these
are Orang Kaya's?

18:42.643 --> 18:43.861
Semingat.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.954
You like it here, Lord James.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.392
In truth, Sire,
I am not a lord.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.394
Well, they think you're a god.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.135
-The bird--
-Well, you tell the bird

18:56.222 --> 18:58.572
I'm just a traveler.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.231
Thank you, cousin.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.841
To begin the spear trading,

19:06.928 --> 19:09.670
I welcome Lord Brooke
with these humble gifts.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.065
I thank Prince Makota.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.503
But I'm afraid I have nothing
to trade in return.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.463
You're my guest.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.253
-Arthur...
-Hmm?

19:27.340 --> 19:29.124
...give me your pistol.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.260
My father's pistol.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.218
On your head.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.224
Prince Makota.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.487
For your kindness.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.669
One more gift.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.631
No!

19:57.718 --> 19:59.937
Tuan, please, do not interfere.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.244
A great honor is being meant.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.115
Oh, Christ!
Honor be damned!

20:06.248 --> 20:08.642
Prince Makota, I thank you.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.123
But I would be more
greatly honored

20:12.211 --> 20:16.215
if you gave me this man's life
as a gift.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.832
You're looking for specimens?

20:35.190 --> 20:37.801
Take this one.
It's fresh.

20:42.197 --> 20:45.940
Savages, we call them.

20:46.027 --> 20:48.464
The White man's burden
to save their souls.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.989
I saw British mercy in India.

20:52.076 --> 20:55.079
The army strapped prisoners
to the mouths of cannon

20:55.166 --> 20:57.081
and blew them apart.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.433
Keeps the savages in line.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.652
- Excuse me, Tuan.

21:02.739 --> 21:05.176
- Come in, Subu.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.355
Prince Makota is here.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.533
Very well.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.230
Bring him down.

21:25.501 --> 21:26.981
Prince Makota.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.290
What a pleasant surprise.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.074
You visit us.

21:33.161 --> 21:35.468
I repay the honor.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.472
A good likeness,
don't you think?

21:39.559 --> 21:42.953
I think it is better to be
Makota's friend than his enemy.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.307
I like you.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.223
So must your queen.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.225
To give you the great guns
on deck.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.881
Oh, those are just little
six-pounders.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.060
In England,

22:03.147 --> 22:05.585
they make it even bigger?

22:05.672 --> 22:07.151
Oh, any size will do,

22:07.238 --> 22:08.892
if you know how to use it well.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.636
This I tell my wives, huh?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.467
How do you fire the cannons?

22:18.554 --> 22:21.165
Will it not destroy
repulsive creatures?

22:23.472 --> 22:26.475
First, you strike the specimens
into the hold,

22:26.562 --> 22:28.434
light the fuse...

22:30.000 --> 22:31.393
and fire.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.745
Most ingenious.

22:35.832 --> 22:39.967
Is that the word for such
a clever moving of things?

22:40.054 --> 22:41.447
Yes.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.100
That's the word.

22:44.014 --> 22:45.407
If you order it,

22:45.494 --> 22:49.498
can ingenious sailors
move the cannons

22:49.585 --> 22:53.894
to attack the rebel fort
upriver, at Belidah?

22:55.112 --> 22:56.897
Theoretically.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.943
So it is agreed.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.642
You will lend us your guns
and bring them upriver,

23:02.729 --> 23:05.601
most theoretically.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.864
Bedruddin will pay you
much gold.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.827
I'm afraid no.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.395
I'm here to study wildlife.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.708
So you say.

23:27.623 --> 23:30.147
That's a Brazilian
wandering spider.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.236
Quite venomous.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.849
It climbs into bananas.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.503
Delicious.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.724
But it's best to think
before you bite.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.514
Lord Brooke.

23:48.601 --> 23:50.080
Prince Makota.

24:02.310 --> 24:07.097
So, what do White men call it
when princes lie to each other?

24:08.142 --> 24:10.057
Diplomacy.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.015
I never said I'd do it.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.846
Not even for your collection?

24:40.130 --> 24:42.045
Like stars in the night.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.529
You're learning Malay.

24:47.616 --> 24:48.748
Charley.

24:53.448 --> 24:56.016
Excuse my interruption, Lord.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.974
But we have not discussed
your price.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.716
-You know my price.
-Yes, yes.

25:00.803 --> 25:04.459
Mercy. A high price...

25:04.546 --> 25:06.156
for four cannons
and three Englishmen.

25:06.243 --> 25:09.333
Prince Makota,
I want your word.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.771
No heads.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.425
Of course.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.079
No heads.

25:20.257 --> 25:22.651
Jim, you recall
the most revered Madame Lim,

25:22.738 --> 25:24.218
from our days in Singapore?

25:24.305 --> 25:25.741
Hello, James.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.526
Ah, Ling.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.223
Forgive me.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.486
Madame Lim.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.707
I've brought your mail.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.145
I thank you.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.363
Arthur?

25:40.103 --> 25:41.496
Excuse me.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.509
I thank you
for your assistance.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.164
How did you find us
way up here?

25:57.251 --> 26:01.385
We have ears in all the islands,
and eyes on all of our friends.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.621
So, Arthur...

26:19.708 --> 26:20.970
news from home?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.236
A son.

26:27.498 --> 26:28.978
We've had a son.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.328
A son?

26:31.415 --> 26:33.679
That must be very fine, Arthur.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.340
She sends her regards.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.213
I rather doubt that.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.306
You ever think of her?

26:52.393 --> 26:54.482
Elizabeth?

26:55.657 --> 26:57.267
Of course.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.921
And with greatest affection.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.272
You'll be
a wonderful father, Arthur.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.628
Why did I lie to him?

27:11.107 --> 27:12.892
Because I can't confess

27:12.979 --> 27:15.111
that I never
loved Elizabeth,

27:15.198 --> 27:18.071
and was happy
when Arthur married her.

27:22.553 --> 27:25.513
The only loving thing
I ever did for Liz

27:25.600 --> 27:28.168
was to break our engagement

27:28.255 --> 27:29.691
and run away
from the scandal

27:29.778 --> 27:32.128
of getting another woman
with child.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.566
Yes, I still think of Elizabeth.

27:35.654 --> 27:40.093
But I pray she doesn't
think of me.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.182
Come on, Charley.
Put your back into it, boy.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.880
-Not this time.
-Faster! Move ahead!

27:44.967 --> 27:47.056
Don't let him talk
to you like that.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.971
Put your back into it, lad.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.538
Faster, Charley.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.758
You're catching him, Charley.
That's good.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.063
Come on, Charley.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.552
Come on, keep paddling.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.729
I think we've seen enough, Sire.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.252
What?

28:09.339 --> 28:11.167
There's something
I don't like about this.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.648
Nonsense. Rebels are noble.
They won't harm their prince.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.432
-Keep paddling.
- Back oars, boys.

28:15.519 --> 28:17.130
Back to the ship.
Back oars, Charley!

28:17.217 --> 28:19.393
It's not yours to give me
orders, Captain Brooke.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.787
Christ!

28:21.874 --> 28:24.267
Charley, jump! Tujang, jump!

28:24.354 --> 28:25.442
Prince Bedruddin, jump.

28:25.529 --> 28:26.705
-No.
-Jump!

28:26.792 --> 28:29.185
-No!
-You have to jump!

28:29.272 --> 28:30.578
Aah!

28:32.972 --> 28:34.364
Sir!

28:51.599 --> 28:55.255
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gentle, gentlemen. Gently.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.213
-Like a woman you love.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.916
You fear very little, James.

29:04.003 --> 29:06.179
I have little to lose, Sire.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.050
But the boy,

29:08.137 --> 29:10.270
he had his whole life
ahead of him.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.229
I'm his prince.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.014
He died with honor.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.673
You think I was too proud
to jump.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.154
But that's not the reason.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.811
I can't swim, James.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.486
All they do is bathe.

29:54.314 --> 29:55.837
Five times a day.

29:57.970 --> 30:00.276
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

30:00.363 --> 30:02.191
Yes, I am.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.671
Do you mind?

30:09.242 --> 30:10.634
Thank you.

30:26.476 --> 30:28.261
I'll put the Orang Kaya
in charge.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.871
He's got fire in his belly.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.568
We can't upset
the natural order.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.267
The princes rule here.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.270
We're observers for
the Royal Geographical Society.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.750
With a ship and guns
under a British flag.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.188
My ship. My guns.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.537
In India,
we were careful

30:43.624 --> 30:45.278
to not interfere
in native squabbles.

30:45.365 --> 30:46.670
Rubbish.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.585
That's how we got India.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.418
Charley! Fire!

31:07.735 --> 31:08.997
Tujang, no.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.825
We attack together.

31:14.524 --> 31:17.571
Prince Makota!
We're attacking the fort!

31:17.658 --> 31:18.877
Where's your honor?

31:18.964 --> 31:21.357
Is it dishonorable
to be clean?

31:21.444 --> 31:24.317
Come, my bloodthirsty
Englishmen.

31:38.505 --> 31:39.985
Rafflesia.

31:48.863 --> 31:51.518
We call it the Devil's box.

31:51.605 --> 31:53.259
No roots.

31:53.346 --> 31:54.956
No leaves.

31:55.043 --> 31:58.133
A few days of beauty,
then they pass on.

31:59.569 --> 32:02.224
-You know your plants.
-I know my country.

32:04.487 --> 32:05.924
Hmm.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.929
You wish to be alone.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.323
No.

32:14.410 --> 32:15.716
I'm happy to be here.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.196
With you.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.895
England girls
do not make you happy?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.767
It was I that made them unhappy.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.684
-Are you happy now?
-Yes.

32:27.771 --> 32:28.947
Because you want to lie with me?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.166
Yes. Uh, no!
I mean, what--

32:31.253 --> 32:33.777
I'm so sorry.
I-I-I didn't mean to say that.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.214
-Forgive me.
-

32:35.301 --> 32:36.563
You are funny.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.478
Always know what to say,
but now, no.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.654
White tiger.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.266
Come, drink with us.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.357
Go to them.

32:48.444 --> 32:49.793
But careful.

33:07.550 --> 33:11.859
I thought you Musselmen
don't drink.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.122
Oh, Dayaks do.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.951
Chinese, too.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.305
-It's tuak.
-It's tuak?

33:23.392 --> 33:24.741
-Tuak.
-Tuak?

33:24.828 --> 33:27.005
-Rice wine.
-Mm. Good.

33:28.136 --> 33:30.356
And only this
they do together.

33:31.531 --> 33:32.880
Come...

33:43.412 --> 33:45.066
-Charley.
-Arthur.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.634
Just... careful.
It's strong.

33:48.983 --> 33:51.029
And thus, we rule.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.259
It's a curious siege.

34:06.479 --> 34:08.959
More like a ballroom dance
than warfare.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.268
They come close...

34:14.400 --> 34:16.445
and never touch.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.448
It's all just for show.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.625
But for whom?

34:25.237 --> 34:28.109
I feel I'm dancing to music
yet to be written.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.416
A tedious gavotte...

34:33.332 --> 34:36.857
that will end only if I step up
and take things in hand.

34:51.611 --> 34:54.092
I haven't properly thanked you
for saving my life.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.616
It was my honor, prince.
Have a drink.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.618
It is forbidden.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.663
Though...

35:00.750 --> 35:02.665
there are worse sins.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.581
Yes.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.889
Cowardice.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.325
Careful.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.115
There's more going on here
than meets the eye.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.552
You miss very little, do you?

35:19.639 --> 35:21.249
For a man who worked so hard

35:21.336 --> 35:23.817
to get me to attack the fort,

35:23.904 --> 35:26.211
Makota doesn't much
want me to take it.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.084
Think, James.

35:30.171 --> 35:32.478
Does he really
want you to win?

35:33.957 --> 35:35.481
What does he gain?

35:39.659 --> 35:41.661
If Makota wins this war...

35:43.053 --> 35:46.753
the Sultan might make him
Rajah of Sarawak.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.278
And that puts him
ahead of you

35:50.365 --> 35:52.150
in line to be Sultan

35:52.237 --> 35:54.064
when the old boy dies.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.154
-But...
-But...

35:57.024 --> 35:59.157
Makota has to be seen

35:59.244 --> 36:01.507
to be the general
that wins the war.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.901
Not me.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.339
And certainly not you.

36:07.426 --> 36:08.818
Yes.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.039
We use you.

36:12.126 --> 36:14.172
You use us.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.567
The British love to play
the great game,

36:18.654 --> 36:22.789
but they never understand
that we are the kings

36:22.876 --> 36:24.791
and you are the pawns.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.107
Except you.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.458
You...

36:40.459 --> 36:42.069
could be a king.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.133
This isn't a fort.

37:04.961 --> 37:07.050
It's a bloody refuge.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.053
Allahu akbar!

37:15.102 --> 37:16.625
I had him in my sights.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.640
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

37:31.727 --> 37:33.860
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

37:33.947 --> 37:38.212
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

37:38.299 --> 37:40.345
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

37:42.347 --> 37:44.174
Makota lied to me.

37:45.698 --> 37:48.744
These rebels aren't protecting
the pirates.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.531
They can't even
protect themselves.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.803
Why do you come here,
to Sarawak?

38:05.892 --> 38:07.589
Escaping, I suppose.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.549
Looking for something.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.428
So to you,
we are just an escape?

38:20.515 --> 38:21.821
James?

38:21.908 --> 38:23.344
Careful.

38:23.431 --> 38:24.998
He loves you.

38:31.178 --> 38:33.876
Lord Bedruddin.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.357
Congratulations
on your victory.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.708
Hardly a victory, Sire.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.929
The rebels, the fort were not
what I expected.

38:44.452 --> 38:47.716
Now I see why this war
has dragged on for so long.

38:49.109 --> 38:52.852
The nobles fight Makota
because he can't...

38:54.070 --> 38:57.117
or won't protect them
from pirates.

38:57.204 --> 39:02.165
And I need someone I can trust
when I am Sultan.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.473
A White man from afar,

39:05.560 --> 39:07.388
with ships and guns...

39:08.520 --> 39:11.218
whom all factions can follow.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.308
That's absurd.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.572
I'm just a traveler.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.053
So you keep saying, Jim.

39:21.446 --> 39:25.624
But there's gold
in Sarawak, Jim.

39:25.711 --> 39:29.192
Coal, and all the spices
your ship will carry.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.935
I don't care about gold.

39:39.942 --> 39:42.467
Is it true what they say?

39:42.554 --> 39:45.121
You were shot in the heart,
yet lived?

39:46.035 --> 39:47.428
No.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.518
It was the lung.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.523
Better the heart.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.786
For Semingat.

39:59.179 --> 40:01.616
That Makota fears,
most of all.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.491
I'm not the man
you think I am.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.628
Who of us is?

40:15.108 --> 40:16.762
Good night, Jim.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.459
Good night, My Prince.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.819
These are for galley slaves.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.865
And these...

40:32.952 --> 40:36.477
These are for my harem.

40:36.564 --> 40:38.871
-Orang Kaya.
- Yeah?

40:38.958 --> 40:41.961
You may also take one head
for each son,

40:42.048 --> 40:43.441
and two for yourself.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.617
Now...

40:45.704 --> 40:47.662
-Allahu akbar!
-Wait!

40:50.012 --> 40:51.405
We had an agreement.

40:51.492 --> 40:54.016
But I'm a Prince.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.497
We make new agreement.

40:58.238 --> 40:59.979
Leave your cannon,
take your flag,

41:00.066 --> 41:01.415
and leave with your head.

41:03.852 --> 41:05.463
Makota, stop!

41:06.681 --> 41:07.900
I insist.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.903
You cannot insist,
Englishman!

41:10.990 --> 41:12.557
You do not rule here.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.389
Is this your decision, Tuan?

41:23.263 --> 41:25.091
Prince Bedruddin,

41:25.178 --> 41:27.528
you offered me Sarawak if I
defeated the rebels at the fort.

41:27.615 --> 41:30.313
-I accept.
-What are you talking about?

41:30.400 --> 41:32.838
Sarawak is mine.

41:35.144 --> 41:36.668
Is it?

41:59.429 --> 42:01.214
Your love for this Englishman

42:01.301 --> 42:03.216
will be your death...

42:03.303 --> 42:04.652
cousin.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.513
Ali's wives.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.342
They do this so your virtue
may rub off on his village.

42:42.429 --> 42:44.779
A most sensible Dayak custom.

42:56.922 --> 42:59.664
Datu Patinggi Ali
thanks you for your mercy.

42:59.751 --> 43:03.319
He paid Makota 20 pasus of rice
and ten slaves in tax.

43:03.406 --> 43:06.409
So how much more must he pay
in punishment

43:06.496 --> 43:07.672
for their rebellion?

43:07.759 --> 43:09.891
From now on, one pasu.

43:09.978 --> 43:12.764
One pasu is only a peck, Tuan.

43:12.851 --> 43:14.243
Nothing.

43:15.549 --> 43:16.898
Patinggi Ali...

43:18.596 --> 43:20.249
what is important to me

43:20.336 --> 43:23.601
is your friendship
and your loyalty.

43:25.037 --> 43:27.735
And there'll be no more
taking of slaves.

43:31.347 --> 43:33.001
Datu Patinggi Ali--

43:33.088 --> 43:35.003
Datu Patinggi Ali thanks Allah
for sending you

43:35.090 --> 43:37.136
like a bird from heaven.

43:37.223 --> 43:38.616
But he asks,

43:38.703 --> 43:41.357
is the Rajah
a bird of passage,

43:41.444 --> 43:45.361
who now flies home to make love
to his woman queen,

43:45.448 --> 43:46.972
get more ships and guns?

43:47.059 --> 43:50.671
Tell Ali my queen
has a husband...

43:51.803 --> 43:53.282
and the ship and guns
are mine.

43:53.369 --> 43:55.937
Still...

43:56.024 --> 43:58.244
once the Sultan of Brunei
makes you Rajah...

43:59.680 --> 44:01.682
will you fly away?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.119
Are you asking for him,

44:04.206 --> 44:05.643
or for you?

44:07.819 --> 44:09.951
You run even from
a question.

44:21.223 --> 44:22.921
Who would believe it,

44:23.008 --> 44:26.838
to be crowned king
by the Sultan of Brunei?

44:28.404 --> 44:31.669
The greatest empire
of spice islands in Asia.

44:31.756 --> 44:34.933
Certainly not my father.

44:35.020 --> 44:37.413
Nor anyone in England.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.677
Certainly not myself.

44:44.029 --> 44:45.683
He who rules the world,

44:45.770 --> 44:48.294
the Sultan Of Brunei...

44:48.381 --> 44:50.862
decrees the White Rajah,

44:50.949 --> 44:52.254
James Brooke,

44:52.341 --> 44:54.692
ruler of Sarawak.

44:57.477 --> 45:00.698
Obey him as you obey our Sultan.

45:14.059 --> 45:16.670
If any will contest this,

45:16.757 --> 45:19.629
let them declare it now,
or forever be silent.

45:46.831 --> 45:47.962
Stop!

45:54.969 --> 45:56.623
Now you must
split his skull.

45:56.710 --> 45:58.843
Do it, to be their king.

46:08.374 --> 46:10.245
No.

46:10.332 --> 46:11.769
I won't rule like that.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.553
Rule?

46:13.640 --> 46:15.860
Are you mad?
We don't belong here.

46:18.340 --> 46:19.907
But I do.

46:23.258 --> 46:25.217
You do not rule here.

46:28.698 --> 46:30.613
You do not rule here.

46:31.745 --> 46:33.921
You do not rule here!

46:51.809 --> 46:53.636
You escaped the harem.

46:53.723 --> 46:55.725
Yes.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.989
But not to join yours.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.569
So you say now.

47:13.656 --> 47:15.702
But once the mystery is gone?

47:17.312 --> 47:19.924
With you it's just one mystery
after another.

47:21.273 --> 47:22.622
Then another...

47:23.623 --> 47:25.016
and another...

48:02.009 --> 48:03.532
Subu?

48:03.619 --> 48:05.143
You must come. Quickly.

48:05.230 --> 48:07.493
Uncle Arthur,
you don't mean that, sir.

48:07.580 --> 48:09.147
I most certainly do.
Now come along.

48:09.234 --> 48:11.410
-He needs us. You, most of all.
-He needs her.

48:11.497 --> 48:13.978
His bloody muse,
or some such rot.

48:14.065 --> 48:15.631
Where are you going, Arthur?

48:27.034 --> 48:28.688
Home.

48:29.558 --> 48:30.820
We're going home.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.474
This is home.

48:32.561 --> 48:33.823
For you and your
native princess,

48:33.911 --> 48:35.042
it may very well be.

48:35.129 --> 48:36.609
But it's not home to me.

48:36.696 --> 48:38.393
It's no place for Charley.

48:39.525 --> 48:41.701
You try and
civilize them, and--

48:41.788 --> 48:43.964
Perhaps we can civilize him.

48:48.577 --> 48:51.537
This pretending to be king
is just too much.

48:53.017 --> 48:54.670
This is where I get off.

48:55.628 --> 48:57.456
You can't have it both ways.

48:57.543 --> 48:59.371
You must choose.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.155
Us...

49:01.242 --> 49:02.722
or them.

49:02.809 --> 49:04.158
I have.

49:08.032 --> 49:10.121
What happens
if she has a child?

49:11.209 --> 49:13.341
You'll just run away again?

49:14.864 --> 49:16.562
You should go now.

49:19.913 --> 49:22.307
-Uncle Arthur.
-Leave it. Leave it.

49:33.144 --> 49:34.972
Go, Charley.

49:37.713 --> 49:39.846
He just misses his wife, sir.

49:39.933 --> 49:41.717
Home.

50:00.127 --> 50:01.911
I was given a sword

50:01.999 --> 50:06.090
to rule a kingdom
larger than England.

50:06.177 --> 50:08.527
But I have had enough
of killing.

50:12.183 --> 50:14.707
If I rule as the British do,

50:14.794 --> 50:18.580
I'd become the man I've spent
my life trying to escape.

50:19.451 --> 50:20.800
But, Rajah,

50:20.887 --> 50:22.541
since you do not allow us
to take heads,

50:22.628 --> 50:24.760
how can I pay
for a second wife?

50:24.847 --> 50:27.154
Surely one wife
is enough for any man, Tujang.

50:27.241 --> 50:28.460
No.

50:28.547 --> 50:30.027
How can I have only one wife?

50:30.114 --> 50:32.333
Perhaps you can pay her in coin?

50:32.420 --> 50:34.814
Subu, give them
two shillings.

50:40.820 --> 50:43.301
-Pounds, then.
-This is not good business.

50:44.389 --> 50:45.651
I must unlearn

50:45.738 --> 50:48.436
everything that I think
I know.

50:49.742 --> 50:52.136
And embrace all that I do not.

50:56.662 --> 50:58.968
Start anew.

50:59.056 --> 51:02.363
Build a natural utopia...

51:02.450 --> 51:05.236
where we love all living
things equally.

51:06.585 --> 51:08.413
A case of murder
in the first degree.

51:08.500 --> 51:09.762
Bring the accused.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.948
But what do I do
when they kill each other?

51:34.221 --> 51:36.441
I've finally found home.

51:38.704 --> 51:42.403
A family to embrace
this barefoot boy of Bengal...

51:43.491 --> 51:45.798
who ran out his father's door

51:45.885 --> 51:47.234
into the jungle...

51:48.279 --> 51:50.063
to find someone
who will love me

51:50.150 --> 51:52.326
as I am.

52:08.081 --> 52:10.605
- Rajah!

52:10.692 --> 52:13.086
Rajah! Rajah!

52:13.173 --> 52:14.740
-Rajah...
-Tujang.

52:14.827 --> 52:16.176
Look at this.

52:16.263 --> 52:17.612
Carnivorous pitcher plant.

52:17.699 --> 52:20.006
The Royal Society
calls it Nepenthes Rajah.

52:20.093 --> 52:22.139
I discovered it.

52:22.226 --> 52:23.923
Was it not here before?

52:26.795 --> 52:29.233
Must be the mail ship
from Singapore.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.191
Is that Master Charley, Tuan?

52:32.105 --> 52:33.498
Spyglass.

52:41.332 --> 52:42.985
Midshipman Brooke, now.

52:43.072 --> 52:44.857
Let's open a bottle of wine.

52:48.034 --> 52:50.384
We heard you jumped ship
in Singapore, joined the Navy.

52:50.471 --> 52:52.865
Yes, sir, but I got leave
to come and give you the mail.

52:52.952 --> 52:54.214
-Charley.
-Good to see you.

52:54.301 --> 52:55.520
And you.

52:56.564 --> 52:57.913
Now, will you take a drink,

52:58.000 --> 52:59.219
or has the Navy
not corrupted you yet?

52:59.306 --> 53:00.612
Oh, you know how it is, sir.

53:00.699 --> 53:02.091
Beer for breakfast,
grog at noon,

53:02.179 --> 53:03.963
-wine and port for dinner.
-Good lord.

53:04.050 --> 53:06.400
I'm surprised they could find
their way anywhere.

53:09.534 --> 53:10.926
-To the crown.
-

53:11.013 --> 53:12.493
Her Majesty's or yours, Rajah?

53:13.842 --> 53:15.409
Drink twice then.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.587
I suppose it's all a great joke
back in England.

53:19.674 --> 53:22.024
The China merchants in Singapore
don't seem to think so.

53:22.111 --> 53:23.591
They sent you this.

53:23.678 --> 53:25.114
Ah.

53:25.985 --> 53:27.160
At last.

53:28.466 --> 53:29.858
We'll use it tonight.

53:31.469 --> 53:32.905
There's talk of
a knighthood, sir.

53:32.992 --> 53:35.560
-For what?
-For making Borneo British, sir.

53:35.647 --> 53:38.432
The French want Sarawak too,
and the Dutch.

53:38.519 --> 53:40.956
Which, of course, makes
Parliament want us even more.

53:41.783 --> 53:43.002
Ah.

53:43.089 --> 53:44.264
The lantern goes inside.

53:44.351 --> 53:45.874
Here, read this.

53:45.961 --> 53:48.355
"The President
of the United States

53:48.442 --> 53:50.575
invites you to America
to sign a treaty

53:50.662 --> 53:54.187
recognizing you as Rajah
of an independent Sarawak."

53:54.274 --> 53:55.841
And there's this.

53:55.928 --> 53:58.800
"A romantic adventurer
like Lord Byron.

53:58.887 --> 54:01.542
Ladies sleep with his cameo
in their bosom."

54:01.629 --> 54:03.327
The Dayaks will love this.

54:03.414 --> 54:06.591
And that's a marriage proposal
from Angela Coutts.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.593
Coutts Bank.

54:08.680 --> 54:10.334
She's the richest woman
in England, sir.

54:10.421 --> 54:11.900
Charley...

54:14.338 --> 54:17.732
we don't need England,
or America,

54:17.819 --> 54:19.691
or Coutts bank.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.868
You see...

54:22.955 --> 54:24.435
I'm as rich as I can be.

54:26.437 --> 54:28.395
Yes, sir, she's very beautiful.

54:29.309 --> 54:30.702
Yes.

54:32.051 --> 54:33.966
And you don't know
the half of it, Charley.

54:34.053 --> 54:35.794
She knows everything.

54:35.881 --> 54:39.493
Dayak culture,
monsoon weather.

54:40.364 --> 54:42.061
You see...

54:42.148 --> 54:43.845
I'm in love.

54:45.194 --> 54:48.241
With the country, sir,
or with her?

54:50.374 --> 54:52.419
Drink twice then.

55:14.746 --> 55:17.009
Again, Rajah. Again.

55:17.096 --> 55:18.619
What is this, sir?

55:19.707 --> 55:21.143
Chicken's feet, Charley.

55:21.230 --> 55:23.624
-Chicken's feet?
-It's a Chinese delicacy.

55:27.628 --> 55:29.195
Oh...

55:32.285 --> 55:34.679
In Singapore, Uncle Arthur
made me eat a bull's...

55:35.984 --> 55:37.290
manhood.

55:40.946 --> 55:43.165
He said it's supposed
to help, you know, in...

55:47.474 --> 55:48.867
Don't worry.

55:51.522 --> 55:52.784
How is Uncle Arthur?

55:52.871 --> 55:54.699
-To Uncle Arthur.
-To Uncle Arthur.

55:54.786 --> 55:58.572
He sends his regards, sir.
He said... he said,

55:58.659 --> 56:00.618
it's supposed to help you rise
to the occasion.

56:58.850 --> 57:00.286
A message, they said.

57:00.373 --> 57:02.157
Snake People,
they've come to haunt us.

57:02.244 --> 57:04.551
They swim up from the sea
to eat us,

57:04.638 --> 57:06.814
like ghosts
with poison teeth.

57:07.902 --> 57:09.251
Snake People?

57:09.338 --> 57:11.123
They are Lanun Pirates.

57:11.210 --> 57:12.559
The rest is just myth.

57:12.646 --> 57:15.083
James. Life. Myth.

57:15.867 --> 57:17.521
It is all one.

57:17.608 --> 57:20.524
We can't row cannon upriver
until the dry season.

57:24.397 --> 57:27.618
I'm going to send a scout.
See if he can find anything.

57:39.847 --> 57:42.502
I feel Makota's presence
behind this.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.507
I sense his desperation...

57:49.727 --> 57:52.033
building like a monsoon.

58:19.191 --> 58:21.933
And he won't go to bed
until he has seen them all.

58:23.369 --> 58:25.284
Incredible.

58:25.371 --> 58:28.069
A man you'd follow
to the ends of the earth.

58:28.940 --> 58:30.376
So did you.

58:31.333 --> 58:33.292
And Colonel Crookshank.

58:46.871 --> 58:48.829
Poor bastard.

58:49.830 --> 58:51.832
I sent him to scout the Lanun.

58:51.919 --> 58:53.834
They took his fingers.

58:54.792 --> 58:55.967
It's Makota.

58:56.054 --> 58:57.621
I'm to blame.

59:00.711 --> 59:03.670
Is there anything I can do
to help, sir?

59:03.757 --> 59:05.542
The Sarawak River.

59:10.634 --> 59:11.983
Where we stand.

59:12.984 --> 59:14.246
Where Makota and the Lanun

59:14.333 --> 59:16.117
are attacking the Dayaks.

59:16.204 --> 59:18.946
In monsoon, the river runs
so fast, it'll drown crocodiles.

59:20.295 --> 59:22.471
We can't get up there
without a steamship.

59:22.559 --> 59:26.084
I was thinking you might ask
the Navy for one.

59:26.171 --> 59:28.042
I'm just a midshipman
on leave, sir.

59:28.129 --> 59:31.306
And, well, they're not
quite pirates, are they?

59:31.393 --> 59:33.178
Not in the Admiralty sense.

59:33.265 --> 59:36.050
Not out at sea,
preying on British interests.

59:36.137 --> 59:37.791
But I am British.

59:37.878 --> 59:39.488
You've seen what the Lanun do.

59:39.576 --> 59:41.055
You've been to a village.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.890
Your music's beautiful, Miss.

59:49.977 --> 59:52.153
It's very sad.

59:57.115 --> 59:58.682
I suppose I could ask
Captain Beech

59:58.769 --> 1:00:00.684
to bring his steamship
from Singapore.

1:00:00.771 --> 1:00:03.600
But why would the Royal Navy
care about Borneo?

1:00:05.253 --> 1:00:06.994
Coal.

1:00:07.081 --> 1:00:10.258
Madame Lim's Hakka miners
have been hauling it up like mad

1:00:10.345 --> 1:00:14.262
from Labuan island
all the way upriver.

1:00:14.349 --> 1:00:17.135
And the British empire
needs coaling stations.

1:00:17.222 --> 1:00:19.659
So we ask them to chart
the rivers of Sarawak

1:00:19.746 --> 1:00:21.269
for a coaling station.

1:00:21.356 --> 1:00:22.880
That just might work.

1:00:24.751 --> 1:00:27.406
A steamship, you say?
For Borneo?

1:00:27.493 --> 1:00:29.408
To chart the rivers
for a coaling station.

1:00:29.495 --> 1:00:30.931
They're impassable
in the monsoon.

1:00:31.018 --> 1:00:33.368
So why not wait
until the dry season?

1:00:35.544 --> 1:00:38.025
Well, sir, there...

1:00:38.896 --> 1:00:40.158
there's also the--

1:00:40.245 --> 1:00:41.550
Yes, out with it, boy.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.335
There's...

1:00:43.422 --> 1:00:45.119
the Snake People.

1:00:45.206 --> 1:00:46.773
The Lanun.

1:00:48.079 --> 1:00:51.343
This is your uncle talking, yes?

1:00:51.430 --> 1:00:53.214
There have been questions
in Parliament.

1:00:53.301 --> 1:00:55.434
Talk of an inquiry.

1:00:55.521 --> 1:00:58.611
He's not quite the thing, is he?

1:00:58.698 --> 1:01:00.091
I do read the London papers,
you know,

1:01:00.178 --> 1:01:01.788
as well as my orders.

1:01:01.875 --> 1:01:04.095
And there is nothing in them
about Snake People.

1:01:04.182 --> 1:01:05.662
But they're pirates, sir,

1:01:05.749 --> 1:01:07.925
and they're preying
on British interests.

1:01:08.012 --> 1:01:09.796
And, pray tell,

1:01:09.883 --> 1:01:13.495
what interest has Britain
in strengthening your Rajah

1:01:13.582 --> 1:01:15.715
if Sarawak is not part
of the Empire?

1:01:17.543 --> 1:01:19.240
Well, sir, he's...

1:01:19.327 --> 1:01:21.242
He's British.

1:01:21.329 --> 1:01:24.593
So you want me

1:01:24.681 --> 1:01:26.857
to take Nemesis,

1:01:26.944 --> 1:01:29.555
the most powerful steamship
on earth,

1:01:29.642 --> 1:01:32.689
up some jungle river
to fight Snake People?

1:01:34.429 --> 1:01:36.040
The Rajah would be
very grateful.

1:01:36.127 --> 1:01:38.825
Gratitude be damned, boy.

1:01:38.912 --> 1:01:40.914
We want his coal
and his colony.

1:01:41.001 --> 1:01:44.178
So just how badly
does Brooke need our help?

1:01:44.265 --> 1:01:46.354
Well, sir, I...

1:01:51.229 --> 1:01:53.492
I think you should go
and ask him.

1:01:54.623 --> 1:01:55.973
Wake up, Rajah.

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:57.539
-

1:03:12.223 --> 1:03:13.790
They were here.

1:03:13.877 --> 1:03:15.835
Rajah?

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.272
Subu?

1:03:18.359 --> 1:03:19.926
Tuan.

1:03:30.632 --> 1:03:32.373
Tujang. Where's Tujang?

1:03:33.287 --> 1:03:35.115
Subu, where is Tujang?

1:03:35.202 --> 1:03:36.813
I don't know.

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:39.554
Tujang! Tujang!

1:04:35.828 --> 1:04:38.048
Divides the living
from the dead.

1:04:49.886 --> 1:04:50.887
No!

1:04:53.411 --> 1:04:55.108
I will not leave.

1:04:57.284 --> 1:05:00.113
You said Tujang
is no longer with you.

1:05:01.245 --> 1:05:02.507
But he's here.

1:05:02.594 --> 1:05:03.943
With me.

1:05:09.470 --> 1:05:11.603
Tujang had a fire inside of him.

1:05:13.039 --> 1:05:15.912
In my dreams he speaks to me.

1:05:17.739 --> 1:05:19.524
"To have peace,

1:05:19.611 --> 1:05:21.352
we must make war."

1:05:25.269 --> 1:05:27.227
This is war!

1:06:00.347 --> 1:06:02.523
God bless England.

1:06:06.266 --> 1:06:07.876
Boarders at the rails.

1:06:25.807 --> 1:06:27.505
Sir Edward,
we are honored.

1:06:27.592 --> 1:06:29.986
-The pleasure's ours, Brooke.
-Thank you.

1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:33.728
Charley.

1:06:33.815 --> 1:06:35.208
With a steamship,
as ordered.

1:06:35.295 --> 1:06:37.080
Just in time. Bless you.

1:06:39.343 --> 1:06:40.735
Crook.

1:06:43.956 --> 1:06:45.436
Come here, cousin.

1:06:45.523 --> 1:06:47.916
Oh! You're back.

1:06:48.004 --> 1:06:49.222
I missed you.

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:53.313
And with Elizabeth.

1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:54.923
Yes. With me.

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:56.751
Mrs. Crookshank,
if you don't mind.

1:06:57.709 --> 1:06:59.450
I do beg your pardon.

1:06:59.537 --> 1:07:01.147
Mrs. Crookshank.

1:07:01.234 --> 1:07:03.106
Is this your
harem slave, James?

1:07:03.193 --> 1:07:05.325
Do tell her
to take my wrap, dear.

1:07:07.893 --> 1:07:09.982
We have no slaves in Sarawak.

1:07:11.766 --> 1:07:13.290
Fatima is my love.

1:07:13.377 --> 1:07:15.553
Say, Brooke,
can we get a drink,

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:17.511
or have you gone
all Mohammedan on us?

1:07:17.598 --> 1:07:20.123
Yes, a drink. Why not?
Let's break the ice a little.

1:07:21.037 --> 1:07:22.429
Does she speak at all?

1:07:22.516 --> 1:07:24.301
Only to my equals.

1:07:30.481 --> 1:07:32.483
We're going to need
a lot more whisky, Charley.

1:07:32.570 --> 1:07:33.527
Yes, sir.

1:07:33.614 --> 1:07:35.051
To Sir Edward Beech.

1:07:35.138 --> 1:07:37.749
Captain of the Nemesis.

1:07:37.836 --> 1:07:39.707
The leaders of Sarawak.

1:07:41.187 --> 1:07:42.971
I think we've met before,
Sir Edward.

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:44.712
Yes, yes.

1:07:44.799 --> 1:07:46.932
Well, it's a wonderful place
you have, Brooke,

1:07:47.019 --> 1:07:48.760
but we're all rather hungry.

1:07:48.847 --> 1:07:50.762
Could you get your niggers
to serve us some dinner, eh?

1:07:52.633 --> 1:07:53.808
Of course.

1:07:55.332 --> 1:07:57.508
Well, I have
a little announcement.

1:07:57.595 --> 1:07:59.814
In reward for his exploits

1:07:59.901 --> 1:08:03.992
in what is to be
our latest crown colony...

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:07.300
I am to carry Mr. Brooke
to Windsor,

1:08:07.387 --> 1:08:11.261
where he shall be invested
by Her Majesty, Queen Victoria,

1:08:11.348 --> 1:08:14.351
as a Knight Commander
of the Bath.

1:08:18.224 --> 1:08:19.747
Here's to...

1:08:19.834 --> 1:08:22.402
Sir James Brooke, KCB.

1:08:22.489 --> 1:08:25.449
Speech. Speech.
- Yes, speech, indeed.

1:08:25.536 --> 1:08:28.365
I thank Sir Edward
for the honor.

1:08:28.452 --> 1:08:30.410
But I can't go home with you.

1:08:30.497 --> 1:08:32.108
Because, as you see,

1:08:32.195 --> 1:08:34.110
I am home.

1:08:35.589 --> 1:08:37.069
Sarawak is a sovereign nation...

1:08:37.156 --> 1:08:38.723
that I rule...

1:08:38.810 --> 1:08:41.334
with the blessings
of its people.

1:08:41.421 --> 1:08:42.988
Sovereign nation?

1:08:43.075 --> 1:08:44.816
But I'm offering you...

1:08:44.903 --> 1:08:46.557
Crookshank, talk to him.

1:08:46.644 --> 1:08:50.561
Sir Edward, the Rajah is greatly
honored by your visit,

1:08:50.648 --> 1:08:52.302
and by your gift
of your great steamship

1:08:52.389 --> 1:08:54.434
to help us fight
the Lanun Pirates.

1:08:54.521 --> 1:08:56.001
Lanun? I'm here for coal

1:08:56.088 --> 1:08:57.872
and to take possession
of a crown colony.

1:08:57.959 --> 1:09:00.223
You've consumed
half the earth, Sir Edward.

1:09:00.310 --> 1:09:01.963
A feast of colonies.

1:09:02.050 --> 1:09:04.531
Surely you cannot
thirst for more.

1:09:04.618 --> 1:09:06.359
And in any case, I'm afraid,

1:09:06.446 --> 1:09:09.014
Sarawak cannot become
your colony

1:09:09.101 --> 1:09:11.364
until the Rajah declares it so.

1:09:11.451 --> 1:09:12.887
He has narimba.

1:09:12.974 --> 1:09:14.454
Yes, narimba.

1:09:14.541 --> 1:09:16.326
A Rajah's right to dispose
of his country.

1:09:16.413 --> 1:09:18.676
Rajah? Narimba?

1:09:19.590 --> 1:09:21.940
Nonsense.
If I chose,

1:09:22.027 --> 1:09:24.116
I could destroy your fairy-tale
country in a week

1:09:24.203 --> 1:09:25.465
with the Nemesis.

1:09:25.552 --> 1:09:27.206
And why would you want
to do that

1:09:27.293 --> 1:09:29.643
when you already have
an Englishman on the throne?

1:09:41.002 --> 1:09:43.135
What is that horrid smell?

1:09:50.098 --> 1:09:51.796
Come along, come along.

1:09:51.883 --> 1:09:53.058
Outside. Outside.

1:09:53.145 --> 1:09:54.625
No.

1:09:54.712 --> 1:09:57.062
The Rajah hasn't seen them yet.

1:09:58.716 --> 1:10:00.108
Surely, Sir James,

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:01.240
you must have
at least one evening

1:10:01.327 --> 1:10:02.807
with your own kind.

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.027
Madame, they are
my honored guests.

1:10:06.114 --> 1:10:08.726
Oh, the princes,
to be sure.

1:10:10.641 --> 1:10:11.816
Now, shoo.

1:10:11.903 --> 1:10:13.426
Mrs. Crookshank!

1:10:16.386 --> 1:10:20.303
You are new here,
and most welcome.

1:10:20.390 --> 1:10:22.653
But I do insist
you show respect.

1:10:24.611 --> 1:10:27.527
Ladies, I believe
this is our cue now.

1:10:29.181 --> 1:10:31.357
-Englishmen and their port.
-Really, Arthur.

1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:37.494
You knew.

1:10:39.931 --> 1:10:41.759
They brought you out here
to twist my arm.

1:10:41.846 --> 1:10:43.151
How could you, Arthur?

1:10:43.239 --> 1:10:45.502
It's time, Jim.
It's for the best.

1:10:49.070 --> 1:10:50.637
No, it's not.

1:10:50.724 --> 1:10:52.117
You know what things were like
before I came.

1:10:52.204 --> 1:10:53.858
And what's changed?

1:10:53.945 --> 1:10:56.252
Headhunters,
pirates, slavers.

1:10:56.339 --> 1:10:58.471
And they'll be here
long after you've gone.

1:10:58.558 --> 1:11:01.300
You've gone broke trying
to save these people, Jim.

1:11:01.387 --> 1:11:03.476
Come home.

1:11:03.563 --> 1:11:05.739
Marry a rich widow.
Get knighted by the queen.

1:11:05.826 --> 1:11:08.481
Let England worry
about Sarawak.

1:11:13.573 --> 1:11:15.358
So that's it?

1:11:17.055 --> 1:11:19.623
The scheme you've cooked up
with your fellows at the club?

1:11:19.710 --> 1:11:22.452
He's gone mad, the poor bastard,
he's gone native.

1:11:22.539 --> 1:11:24.628
Bring him back to England,
marry him, knight him,

1:11:24.715 --> 1:11:26.804
and then we'll have
another colony.

1:11:39.469 --> 1:11:40.905
I'm not mad.

1:11:47.781 --> 1:11:49.522
No.

1:11:49.609 --> 1:11:51.350
You're just different.

1:12:23.774 --> 1:12:25.297
We should let him
think about it.

1:12:25.384 --> 1:12:26.864
I'm going with him.

1:12:26.951 --> 1:12:28.779
Why?

1:12:28.866 --> 1:12:30.955
She's the one.
The one you left.

1:12:31.042 --> 1:12:35.089
I don't care about her.
I love you.

1:12:36.613 --> 1:12:38.571
They humiliated me.

1:12:43.576 --> 1:12:45.752
I gave myself to you.

1:12:45.839 --> 1:12:47.798
All of me.

1:12:47.885 --> 1:12:49.234
Fatima...

1:12:49.321 --> 1:12:53.412
please come back inside.

1:12:53.499 --> 1:12:56.241
I can never be English.

1:12:57.198 --> 1:12:59.113
I don't want you to be.

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:00.593
I just want you.

1:13:01.812 --> 1:13:03.379
You're one of them.

1:13:04.771 --> 1:13:06.904
You cannot run
from who you are.

1:13:10.516 --> 1:13:12.126
Fatima.

1:14:01.741 --> 1:14:04.222
What will you do now, Rajah?

1:14:04.309 --> 1:14:06.006
Go to bed.

1:14:07.268 --> 1:14:08.748
I have a fever.

1:14:10.663 --> 1:14:13.536
I think Fatima
is waiting for you.

1:14:13.623 --> 1:14:15.276
No.

1:14:15.363 --> 1:14:17.278
She went to Lundu.

1:14:17.365 --> 1:14:20.804
She's upset.

1:14:20.891 --> 1:14:23.284
This comes of treating her
like an Englishwoman, Jim.

1:14:23.371 --> 1:14:26.244
A Malay wife would not
have been at the table.

1:14:26.331 --> 1:14:28.115
The Lanun will attack soon.

1:14:28.202 --> 1:14:30.466
They have arms, boats, gold,

1:14:30.553 --> 1:14:32.816
and Makota to lead them.

1:14:32.903 --> 1:14:36.515
Why not let this detestable
Sir Edward woo you a little?

1:14:37.951 --> 1:14:40.258
Give England an island
full of coal and fever.

1:14:40.345 --> 1:14:43.261
Like Labuan.

1:14:43.348 --> 1:14:45.829
A small price for
a steamship, Jim.

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:49.180
You don't know them.

1:14:50.268 --> 1:14:51.791
England.

1:14:51.878 --> 1:14:53.880
The Empire.

1:14:55.534 --> 1:14:57.493
They don't want some of you.

1:14:58.624 --> 1:15:00.800
England devours
all of you.

1:15:02.759 --> 1:15:04.412
I was born in India.

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:06.937
I've seen it firsthand.

1:15:08.286 --> 1:15:09.853
Better that than Lanun.

1:15:09.940 --> 1:15:13.073
Kill the snake once
and for all, now.

1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:15.206
Or leave.

1:15:15.293 --> 1:15:17.164
But you must decide.

1:15:19.036 --> 1:15:20.733
So, what do you choose?

1:15:21.604 --> 1:15:23.214
I choose Sarawak.

1:15:24.650 --> 1:15:26.086
Fatima.

1:15:27.479 --> 1:15:29.046
You.

1:15:32.745 --> 1:15:36.357
Firelight dancing
on the river.

1:15:36.444 --> 1:15:40.623
The sound of Malay voices
singing in my dreams.

1:15:42.668 --> 1:15:44.583
All of it.

1:15:49.153 --> 1:15:50.546
Yes.

1:15:51.416 --> 1:15:53.200
Definitely a fever.

1:15:56.769 --> 1:15:58.466
Good night.

1:16:05.778 --> 1:16:07.867
Ahoy, Chinamen! Chinamen!

1:16:21.228 --> 1:16:22.795
It's all just happening.

1:16:23.883 --> 1:16:25.581
I can't seem to stop it.

1:16:27.713 --> 1:16:29.236
Jim, look at me.

1:16:31.412 --> 1:16:32.892
You're not well.

1:16:34.198 --> 1:16:36.069
Come on.

1:19:12.225 --> 1:19:14.053
Honestly, fireworks at
this time of night?

1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:15.402
Elizabeth, we're under attack.

1:19:15.489 --> 1:19:16.926
-What?
-You have to hide.

1:19:22.975 --> 1:19:25.151
-You can't leave me.
-I have got to find Jim. Come.

1:19:25.238 --> 1:19:27.327
-Ridiculous. I can't--
-He needs me. The cannon.

1:19:27.414 --> 1:19:29.677
-Come on, get in.
-What am I supposed to do?

1:19:29.765 --> 1:19:31.070
Elizabeth, I'll come for you.

1:19:31.157 --> 1:19:33.072
You must go to James.

1:19:33.159 --> 1:19:36.946
Tell the Rajah
that my last thoughts

1:19:37.033 --> 1:19:39.339
were of my love for him.

1:19:39.426 --> 1:19:41.646
Here, go.

1:19:43.430 --> 1:19:44.780
I'll come back.

1:20:11.284 --> 1:20:14.766
Jim! The guns!
Where are they?

1:20:15.985 --> 1:20:17.856
Jim! Jim!

1:20:17.943 --> 1:20:19.510
The guns!

1:20:19.597 --> 1:20:21.164
Arthur?

1:20:22.426 --> 1:20:24.167
You're back in England.

1:20:24.254 --> 1:20:26.082
With Elizabeth.

1:20:27.605 --> 1:20:29.737
Jim, snap to it.

1:20:29.825 --> 1:20:31.130
The guns, man!
Where are they?

1:20:31.217 --> 1:20:32.784
Jim, the guns.

1:20:46.145 --> 1:20:47.668
This is all Makota's doing.

1:20:49.105 --> 1:20:50.889
I've got a pistol
inside the house.

1:20:50.976 --> 1:20:53.022
No, no, no. Jim...

1:20:55.459 --> 1:20:56.852
Jim.

1:21:23.835 --> 1:21:26.185
Subu! Over here!

1:21:28.144 --> 1:21:29.623
So...

1:21:29.710 --> 1:21:31.799
Brooke's got into some
native squabble, eh?

1:21:31.887 --> 1:21:33.410
We've got to hurry.

1:21:33.497 --> 1:21:36.065
Oh, do sit down, Lieutenant.
You look a mess.

1:21:36.152 --> 1:21:37.936
With respect, sir,
there's no time.

1:21:38.023 --> 1:21:40.243
We've got to take the Nemesis
upriver to save them.

1:21:40.330 --> 1:21:41.722
Hmm.

1:21:49.556 --> 1:21:52.864
Her Majesty's steamships are not
for haring around the jungle.

1:21:52.951 --> 1:21:54.561
But they're English, sir.

1:21:54.648 --> 1:21:56.607
Sir James, the Crookshanks.
Women and children.

1:21:56.694 --> 1:21:58.130
And the Dayaks.

1:21:58.217 --> 1:22:00.219
Do you know what the Lanun
will do to them?

1:22:00.306 --> 1:22:02.439
I am sorry for the Crookshanks,

1:22:02.526 --> 1:22:04.136
but that's on Brooke.

1:22:04.223 --> 1:22:06.573
As for Dayaks and Lanun,

1:22:06.660 --> 1:22:08.575
one native's
as much as another.

1:22:09.707 --> 1:22:12.188
-Sir, I have to insist--
-No.

1:22:12.275 --> 1:22:14.407
The Nemesis
shall remain here.

1:22:14.494 --> 1:22:15.931
We'll let them kill each other,

1:22:16.018 --> 1:22:17.933
and then come in and pick up
the pieces.

1:22:19.412 --> 1:22:21.414
Sir, I respectfully request
to go upriver

1:22:21.501 --> 1:22:23.242
to pick up any survivors.

1:22:24.374 --> 1:22:26.158
As you wish.

1:22:26.245 --> 1:22:29.074
But not as the Navy.
You're on your own.

1:22:30.423 --> 1:22:31.511
I say, I'm out of bacon.

1:22:31.598 --> 1:22:32.991
Boy.

1:22:45.482 --> 1:22:49.138
Now, I am your Rajah.

1:22:50.443 --> 1:22:53.838
No more English
to steal our land...

1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:58.016
to rob our coal for the Navy.

1:23:03.413 --> 1:23:06.198
Take away our gold

1:23:06.285 --> 1:23:09.462
so their fine women

1:23:09.549 --> 1:23:13.031
can have shiny things
in their ears

1:23:13.118 --> 1:23:16.078
as they shoo out the niggers.

1:23:16.165 --> 1:23:18.732
Where are your earrings now?

1:23:18.819 --> 1:23:20.299
Get away from her.

1:23:20.386 --> 1:23:21.474
You're mad.

1:23:21.561 --> 1:23:23.085
I'm not mad.

1:23:24.477 --> 1:23:26.914
-I'm a patriot.
- Patriot?

1:23:27.002 --> 1:23:29.613
-Wait till Brooke comes back.
- He's here.

1:23:30.831 --> 1:23:33.399
There's your white Rajah.

1:23:46.586 --> 1:23:48.414
Ahoy!

1:23:50.329 --> 1:23:52.331
Is anybody out there?

1:24:00.861 --> 1:24:02.298
Ahoy!

1:24:05.388 --> 1:24:07.520
Subu, Subu, portside.

1:24:13.265 --> 1:24:15.180
-Charley.
- It's me.

1:24:16.573 --> 1:24:18.314
You're okay.

1:24:18.401 --> 1:24:19.924
Lift him.

1:24:27.975 --> 1:24:29.238
It's all right.

1:24:29.325 --> 1:24:30.761
Hey, hey.

1:24:30.848 --> 1:24:32.806
Lift him. Lift him.

1:24:33.677 --> 1:24:34.895
Are you okay?

1:24:45.210 --> 1:24:46.690
Tuan.

1:24:48.866 --> 1:24:50.868
He said to say
he loved you.

1:25:13.238 --> 1:25:14.892
Elizabeth? Elizabeth?

1:25:14.979 --> 1:25:16.807
They realized
you were alive,

1:25:16.894 --> 1:25:19.201
they took all the prisoners
and left for Brunei.

1:25:19.288 --> 1:25:21.159
Disappeared like ghosts.

1:25:21.246 --> 1:25:22.595
Like ghosts.

1:25:24.119 --> 1:25:26.033
We didn't pass them
coming upriver.

1:25:26.121 --> 1:25:27.861
They'll head east
through the mangrove.

1:25:27.948 --> 1:25:29.385
We can catch them if we hurry.

1:25:31.387 --> 1:25:32.910
Sir?

1:25:46.489 --> 1:25:47.925
Sir...

1:26:31.447 --> 1:26:33.449
It's all my fault.

1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:36.974
It's too dangerous.

1:26:39.019 --> 1:26:41.283
We've got to get you home.

1:27:43.736 --> 1:27:45.651
It was Tujang's.

1:27:51.396 --> 1:27:53.616
You can't run from this, James.

1:27:55.182 --> 1:27:56.967
She's right, sir. Look.

1:28:46.233 --> 1:28:48.192
I thought I was dead.

1:28:49.149 --> 1:28:50.934
Leaving my past behind.

1:28:53.328 --> 1:28:56.156
Instead, it was those I loved
who died.

1:28:57.680 --> 1:28:59.899
And I have left them.

1:29:02.641 --> 1:29:05.688
I see it clearly now.

1:29:05.775 --> 1:29:09.344
I never needed a steamship
to find Makota.

1:29:12.782 --> 1:29:14.653
He came to me.

1:29:18.265 --> 1:29:21.356
He was always coming to me.

1:29:47.512 --> 1:29:49.775
Malay guards.

1:30:00.525 --> 1:30:02.397
Makota's men.

1:30:02.484 --> 1:30:04.311
The Lanun caught them stealing.

1:30:06.923 --> 1:30:09.099
Makota thinks
he can control them.

1:30:10.883 --> 1:30:12.885
Lanun care only for the Lanun.

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:20.153
They're over there, listen,
in the cove.

1:30:24.941 --> 1:30:26.377
Let's get the Royalist.

1:30:26.464 --> 1:30:27.987
We can anchor up
beyond the reef,

1:30:28.074 --> 1:30:29.598
in cannon range.

1:30:29.685 --> 1:30:31.948
No.

1:30:32.035 --> 1:30:33.471
It's too bright.

1:30:34.429 --> 1:30:35.865
Later.

1:30:47.529 --> 1:30:48.965
I see him...

1:30:50.096 --> 1:30:53.056
out there alone
with the Lanun.

1:30:53.970 --> 1:30:56.668
Fighting over the spoils.

1:30:57.756 --> 1:31:00.150
Once they devour the prisoners,

1:31:00.237 --> 1:31:03.327
they'll fall on him
like ravening beasts.

1:31:17.167 --> 1:31:20.475
I've been living in a fantasy
of my own making.

1:31:22.259 --> 1:31:25.871
To rule the jungle,
I must love the jungle.

1:31:26.785 --> 1:31:28.178
All of it.

1:31:30.006 --> 1:31:31.747
The beauty...

1:31:34.227 --> 1:31:35.968
and the blood.

1:31:38.144 --> 1:31:41.017
He's not waiting for me
to kill him.

1:31:42.888 --> 1:31:45.456
He's waiting for me
to save him.

1:33:02.446 --> 1:33:06.581
Too weak to kill.
Too weak to rule.

1:33:25.817 --> 1:33:28.037
I surrender.

1:33:30.169 --> 1:33:31.693
Mercy.

1:33:31.780 --> 1:33:34.086
Please. Please.

1:33:35.697 --> 1:33:37.960
Mercy.

1:33:39.309 --> 1:33:40.919
Please.

1:33:42.704 --> 1:33:44.314
No! No!

1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:17.363
And so I am ruined...

1:35:18.451 --> 1:35:19.888
but free.

1:35:22.586 --> 1:35:25.023
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!

1:35:25.110 --> 1:35:27.896
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!

1:35:50.570 --> 1:35:52.224
I'm not ready, sir.

1:35:53.443 --> 1:35:55.837
You're the boy
I used to be, Charley.

1:35:58.274 --> 1:36:00.232
I'd rather be the man
you are now.

1:36:02.495 --> 1:36:03.932
No.

1:36:04.019 --> 1:36:05.934
You don't want that.

1:36:06.021 --> 1:36:09.328
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!

1:36:09.415 --> 1:36:13.158
Rajah! Rajah!
Rajah! Rajah!

1:36:13.245 --> 1:36:16.248
Rajah! Rajah! Rajah!
