00:08.749 --> 00:10.499
You see that
creature there?

00:10.499 --> 00:13.208
That ugly thing
creates droppings
of pure gold.

00:13.208 --> 00:14.874
I am Groot?

00:14.874 --> 00:17.166
No, they aren't those
kind of droppings.

Well, I don't
think they are.

00:19.749 --> 00:21.083
All that matters... Gold!

00:22.083 --> 00:24.208
Now be real stealthy.

Trust me, you do not
want to wake this thing up.

I am Groot.

01:22.832 --> 01:24.041
Ugh! Now we gotta
go back

01:24.041 --> 01:25.624
and return
this hideous baby.

01:25.624 --> 01:27.041
Can't I win
