you had me have with my friends...

some of our issues?

over the dishes?

Yes. And frankly, I haven't seen any
results since I've been coming to you,

00:50.600 --> 00:53.456

the hot seat until you resolve this.

- Resolve this-
- Who's going to do the dishes.

a great opportunity...

Okay, um- Let me first
just say that...

01:58.880 --> 02:01.201

Yeah, actually, this argument
is more about determining...

most of us will be winners.

not gonna be me, okay?
