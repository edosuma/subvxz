my lady!

08:23.295 --> 08:24.589
Who? Jessie?

08:24.590 --> 08:25.881
Isn't she a little

08:23.295 --> 08:25.881
bit old for you?

08:25.923 --> 08:27.799
- Hey, I grew an inch
- last year!

08:27.841 --> 08:29.176
I'm almost

08:29.177 --> 08:30.510
at chin level!

08:30.552 --> 08:32.054
The point is,

08:32.054 --> 08:33.554
Jessie is the

08:30.552 --> 08:33.554
nicest, sweetest,

08:33.597 --> 08:35.057
- coolest girl
- in the world!

Uh, why would

09:15.223 --> 09:16.765
you think that?

09:18.183 --> 09:19.351
Uh, because Emma

- "sneaking around" hat.

the gorilla

10:58.700 --> 11:00.911
did not appreciate

11:00.952 --> 11:01.953
the purple nurple

11:01.954 --> 11:02.954
you gave him.

11:02.996 --> 11:03.997
I felt just as weird

11:03.998 --> 11:04.998
about it as he did.

11:06.584 --> 11:07.939
And you'll have to throw me

from a moving train

- speak and act,

Yeah, well,

11:29.440 --> 11:31.876

- Ever happened to me.

the only time I didn't

13:22.802 --> 13:26.431
tell you the truth!

15:38.271 --> 15:42.275
Please forgive me.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.278
Look, um...

15:46.154 --> 15:48.031
Mildred...

15:48.072 --> 15:49.762
Obviously you love animals.

15:49.763 --> 15:51.451
You live with them,

15:48.072 --> 15:51.451
you care for them...

15:51.493 --> 15:53.119
- You have slumber parties
- with them.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.061
Can't you help out

15:57.062 --> 15:58.249
a fellow animal lover?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.148
Please, please, please

16:00.149 --> 16:02.003
let Ravi keep his lizard.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.839
Yeah, after Mrs. Kipling,

16:03.840 --> 16:05.632
Ravi's best friend is...

16:05.674 --> 16:07.447
Actually, I don't think

16:07.448 --> 16:09.219
he has any other friends.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.512
Can't you do this

16:10.513 --> 16:11.763
for our pathetic brother?

16:13.264 --> 16:15.183
I wish I could.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.685
I'm a big loser

16:16.686 --> 16:18.144
who only gets along

16:15.225 --> 16:18.144
with animals, too.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.377
Okay, people,

16:20.378 --> 16:22.566
now we are

16:18.186 --> 16:22.566
just piling on!

16:22.607 --> 16:24.506
But I absolutely,

16:24.507 --> 16:26.403
positively cannot

16:22.607 --> 16:26.403
break the rules and...

16:26.444 --> 16:27.926
How would you like the

16:27.927 --> 16:29.406
Ross Family Primate Habitat

16:29.447 --> 16:30.762
to be renamed the

16:30.763 --> 16:32.075
"Mildred Lumpkey

16:29.447 --> 16:32.075
Monkey House?"

16:32.116 --> 16:33.201
I'd love it!

16:34.994 --> 16:36.788
- So we have a deal!
- (SPITS)

16:37.581 --> 16:39.082
- Okay,
- that's just gross,

16:39.123 --> 16:40.667
- And I have to floss
- the hippos.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.024
Guess what, Gladys.

16:43.025 --> 16:44.170
You're going home.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.089
- How did you know
- her name was Gladys?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.507
- She just looks
- like a Gladys.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.220
And Ms. Lumpkey,

16:52.221 --> 16:54.347
can you promise to give

16:50.093 --> 16:54.347
Zeebee extra carrots

16:54.389 --> 16:55.641
and a kiss every night

16:55.642 --> 16:56.892
before bedtime?

16:56.934 --> 16:58.539
Sure, I'll even

16:58.540 --> 17:00.144
cuddle with him

16:56.934 --> 17:00.144
at night if you like.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.229
That's okay.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.403
You won't believe it!

17:08.444 --> 17:09.570
That slimeball, McD,

17:09.571 --> 17:10.696
just fired me off the movie!

17:11.281 --> 17:13.116
Ow!

17:13.156 --> 17:14.785
That's horrible!

17:14.786 --> 17:16.411
But I still get a date

17:13.156 --> 17:16.411
with Mila Kunis right?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.289
I mean,

17:19.290 --> 17:20.415
that's horrible!

17:22.291 --> 17:24.085
- Ugh. Do we have
- to watch this?

17:24.127 --> 17:25.420
I don't need to be

17:25.421 --> 17:26.713
reminded that I just

17:24.127 --> 17:26.713
lost my first movie role,

17:26.755 --> 17:27.881
and the most amazing

17:27.882 --> 17:29.007
friend I've ever had.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.926
- Not to mention - messing up
- My documentary.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.282
- Yeah, I've really - got to work on this
- Whole empathy thing.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.306
Yeah.

17:38.976 --> 17:39.998
Wait! Wait!

17:39.999 --> 17:41.019
Did you see that?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.291
The prop guy

17:42.292 --> 17:43.521
eating six donuts

17:41.060 --> 17:43.521
simultaneously?

17:43.563 --> 17:44.940
Awesome, right?

17:44.982 --> 17:47.142
- I think he unhinged his jaw
- to get the last one in.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.152
Not that! That!

17:51.154 --> 17:52.322
This video

17:52.323 --> 17:53.490
will prove to Shaylee

17:51.154 --> 17:53.490
that I wasn't lying

17:53.531 --> 17:55.283
- and that McD
- is a huge McJerk.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.494
- Jessie, wait!
- What?

17:58.161 --> 17:59.746
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

17:59.788 --> 18:01.081
Just so you know,

18:01.082 --> 18:02.373
if you rewind too far,

18:02.415 --> 18:03.938
you may or may not

18:03.939 --> 18:05.460
see footage of you

18:02.415 --> 18:05.460
sleeping in your bedroom.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.382
Huh, all this time,

18:09.383 --> 18:10.799
I thought that drool

18:07.963 --> 18:10.799
on the pillow was mine.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.438
Why does it always

18:23.102 --> 18:25.438
have to be snakes?

18:26.314 --> 18:28.066
Get me out of here.

and make it better!

Oh, look!

18:54.156 --> 18:55.385
There's Shaylee.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.137
Great! Now we just

18:57.138 --> 18:58.847
have to run over there

18:55.426 --> 18:58.847
before McD catches us.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.727
aren't on the ground.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.395
- Put me down,
- you big ape!

19:05.436 --> 19:06.834
It's not the actual

19:06.835 --> 19:08.231
ape again, is it?

19:08.272 --> 19:09.900
- No, but that

Wait! Please.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.032
- Jessie, I don't
- want to hear it.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.849
But I have proof

20:03.850 --> 20:05.246
that McD is the one

20:02.452 --> 20:05.246
you can't trust!

20:07.373 --> 20:08.708
Please, just no more lies!

20:10.460 --> 20:13.171
Hey! Jessie never lies!

20:13.212 --> 20:14.941
- Well, she lied about
- being a stunt woman,

20:14.965 --> 20:16.112
And about

20:16.113 --> 20:17.258
liking my movie

20:14.965 --> 20:17.258
with Katherine Heigl!

20:18.301 --> 20:20.053
- Okay, so she
- lies like a rug!

20:20.095 --> 20:22.013
- But she's not
- lying about this!

20:22.055 --> 20:23.578
Shaylee, the proof

20:23.579 --> 20:25.100
is in this camera.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.123
Look if you want.

20:27.124 --> 20:29.104
But just know,

20:25.142 --> 20:29.104
I am your friend,

- and I can't stand - knowing you're
- With some guy

20:30.647 --> 20:32.127
- Who doesn't really
- care about you.

20:39.156 --> 20:40.178
That's what McD

20:40.179 --> 20:41.199
does to my hair.

Hey, big guy.

Uh, great job,

20:50.438 --> 20:52.376
doing whatever

20:48.498 --> 20:52.376
it is that you do.

Jessie, wait!

21:00.073 --> 21:01.260
McD hit on?

(GRUNTING)

21:09.310 --> 21:10.583
McD, how could

21:10.584 --> 21:11.855
you do this?

21:11.896 --> 21:13.773
I trusted you.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.463
Shaylee, come on,

21:15.464 --> 21:17.110
let's not blow this

21:13.815 --> 21:17.110
out of proportion.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.487
Technically,

21:18.488 --> 21:19.821
it's just one mistake,

21:21.198 --> 21:23.054
that I keep making

21:23.055 --> 21:24.909
over and over again.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.720
- Keep digging, pal.
- Okay, keep out of this!

21:26.744 --> 21:28.663
Shaylee, forgive me.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.623
We're at a temple.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.376
Let me worship you.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.461
I would rather be

21:34.462 --> 21:35.503
kissed by Koko.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.173
No, you wouldn't.

Let's just move on

21:45.263 --> 21:48.933
to the next shot.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.122
You should just move on

21:50.123 --> 21:51.269
the unemployment line,

21:51.310 --> 21:54.022
because you are fired.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.336
What?

21:55.337 --> 21:56.607
You can't do that!

21:56.649 --> 21:58.026
- I'm gonna tell
- my dad on you!

21:58.068 --> 21:59.694
Go ahead.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.672
- My contract states that
- I get director approval,

22:01.696 --> 22:02.760
And you are

22:02.761 --> 22:03.823
now un-approved.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.410
Daddy?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.620
Shaylee says she can fire me!

22:09.621 --> 22:11.789
That's not true, is it?

22:13.541 --> 22:17.295
Oh. Not cool, Dad!

22:18.963 --> 22:20.090
(GRUNTS)

22:21.216 --> 22:25.469
And fired!

Please remove

22:30.351 --> 22:32.269
Timmy Finkleberg

22:28.431 --> 22:32.269
from the set.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.229

22:34.271 --> 22:35.897
That's my real name.

22:35.939 --> 22:36.982
There's not a Mc or a D

22:36.983 --> 22:38.024
anywhere in there.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.483
You disgust me!

22:40.818 --> 22:42.508
On second thought,

22:42.509 --> 22:44.197
I'll take care of this.

He's not gonna come

22:52.455 --> 22:56.751
flying back, is he?

22:56.793 --> 22:58.065
Jessie, I'm so sorry.

22:58.066 --> 22:59.337
I should have

22:56.793 --> 22:59.337
believed you.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.942
I guess I'm just

23:00.943 --> 23:02.506
new to this whole

22:59.378 --> 23:02.506
best friends thing.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.593
Can you ever forgive me?

23:05.635 --> 23:07.220
Of course. Look,

23:07.221 --> 23:08.805
I know how bad boyfriends

23:05.635 --> 23:08.805
can mess with your head.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.640
- I once let this guy,
- Pete, borrow my car.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.600
Haven't seen it since.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.202
- Every once in a while, - I get
a parking ticket - From Arizona.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.522
Hey, now that

23:17.523 --> 23:18.898
we're besties again,

23:18.940 --> 23:20.004
would you maybe want to

23:20.005 --> 23:21.067
go with me to the premiere

23:21.109 --> 23:22.528
of Chris Hemsworth's

23:22.529 --> 23:23.945
new movie at the

23:21.109 --> 23:23.945
Cannes Film Festival?

23:23.987 --> 23:24.988
Would I!

23:25.322 --> 23:26.739
(GROANS)

23:26.781 --> 23:28.741
- There goes
- my pancreas.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.121
This would make a great

23:33.122 --> 23:34.580
double feature with my

23:31.661 --> 23:34.580
Jessie sleeping movie.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.585
(CHUCKLES) Which

23:38.586 --> 23:40.878
may or may not exist.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.356
- I should take - that camera
- Away from you,

23:42.380 --> 23:43.444
Or start locking

23:43.445 --> 23:44.507
my door.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.092
Hey, if it wasn't for

23:46.093 --> 23:47.635
Luke's creepy camera work,

23:44.548 --> 23:47.635
I'd still be with McD.

23:48.845 --> 23:50.165
- Bring it in, sprog!
- Come here.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.271
Awesome!

24:02.608 --> 24:03.860
So, did you like

24:03.861 --> 24:05.111
my documentary?

24:02.608 --> 24:05.111
Loved it!

24:05.153 --> 24:06.279
Although I could've done

24:06.280 --> 24:07.405
without the bonus feature

24:07.446 --> 24:08.966
- of that gorilla
- giving me a noogie.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.577
Hey, Zuri.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.472
- I heard about Zeebee's
- adventure in the penthouse.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.622
Now that he's

24:16.623 --> 24:17.748
back at the zoo,

24:15.496 --> 24:17.748
are you okay?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.938
Yeah. Ms. Lumpkey said

24:19.939 --> 24:22.086
they're getting a new zebra

24:17.790 --> 24:22.086
to keep Zeebee company.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.152
Plus, I realized it's

24:24.153 --> 24:26.174
silly to keep a zebra

24:22.128 --> 24:26.174
in the apartment.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.280
That's a lesson

24:27.281 --> 24:28.343
I never thought

24:26.216 --> 24:28.343
you would need to learn,

24:28.385 --> 24:30.469
but very sensible.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.263
- So, what's with
- the bowl of milk?

24:32.305 --> 24:33.724
Oh, this is

24:33.725 --> 24:35.141
for my new kitty.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.141
You want to meet him?

24:35.183 --> 24:36.413
(GASPS) We got a kitty?

24:36.414 --> 24:37.643
Where is the little guy?

24:37.685 --> 24:39.562
- He's out here.
- Oh!

24:40.813 --> 24:41.981
(GASPS) Whoa!

24:43.941 --> 24:45.776
- I am not scooping
- that kitty litter.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.487
(WHISTLING)

24:50.407 --> 24:52.075
- You have got
- to be kidding.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.784
(GROWLING)

24:53.826 --> 24:54.911
(SCREAMING)

24:58.831 --> 24:59.832
Bertram has got

24:59.833 --> 25:00.833
to stop buying

24:58.831 --> 25:00.833
animal print pajamas.
