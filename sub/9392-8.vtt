So, Cleveland,
you got to be pretty psyched

00:36.003 --> 00:37.269
about President Ubama, huh?

00:37.271 --> 00:38.804
W-What?

00:38.806 --> 00:40.839
Well, I mean, you remember how
a lot of people said, like,

00:40.841 --> 00:42.408
"Oh, Ubama's not gonna
be able to do it,"

00:42.410 --> 00:43.809
but he's-he's
hanging in there.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.344
Peter, it's "Obama."

00:45.346 --> 00:47.246
Eh, You-bama, Me-bama,
We-bama, who cares?

00:47.248 --> 00:49.581
It's a black guy in a suit,
let's just marvel at that.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.949
Gosh, Cleveland,
it sure is great

00:50.951 --> 00:53.519
having you back at The Clam,
even if it's just for a week.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.554
(ringtone):
♪ My name is Cleveland Brown

00:55.556 --> 00:57.456
♪ And I am proud to be...

00:57.458 --> 00:59.091
Oh, hang on, that's
my cell phone.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.060
Aw, Peter,
you're using the song!

01:01.062 --> 01:02.261
Thank you.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.695
Well, the numbers
ain't so good,

01:03.697 --> 01:05.864
so we got to do everything
we can-- Hello, Lois.

01:05.866 --> 01:09.701
You told me you were gonna clean
out those boxes in the basement

01:09.703 --> 01:10.803
and put them in the attic.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.237
Lois, it just sounds like
busy work.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.739
It is busy work.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.808
I'm trying to keep you
off the streets and off drugs.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.876
I'm selling those candy bars!

01:17.878 --> 01:19.945
(knocking)

01:19.947 --> 01:22.714
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you
want to buy some candy bars

01:22.716 --> 01:25.017
so we can get some new uniforms
for our baseball team?

01:25.019 --> 01:27.119
Where'd you get
those candy bars?

01:28.054 --> 01:29.688
Peter, I need you home.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.024
You also promised you'd fix
that shelf in the garage.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.025
Oh, Lois, I'm losing you.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.726
(makes static noises)

01:34.728 --> 01:36.595
Hello? Hello?

01:36.597 --> 01:37.596
Hello?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.864
Oh, hey, Lois.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.399
This is somebody else now.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.267
There must've been
a cross connection.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.570
My name is Mike,
and I'm somewhere else

01:44.572 --> 01:45.904
trying to make my own call.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.039
Fine, Mike.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.208
You tell Peter he's in trouble
when he gets home.

01:49.210 --> 01:52.044
You can tell him yourself,
because Mike is Peter!

01:52.046 --> 01:53.178
Oh, my God.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.446
Are you serious?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.948
That was very good, Peter.

01:55.950 --> 01:56.949
I know!

01:56.951 --> 01:58.484
(sighs)
Geez.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.686
That's all my life is lately,
just a bunch of chores.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.188
I'm sick of Lois always
making me do stupid stuff.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.723
I know what you're saying,
Peter.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.824
Bonnie's always making me do

02:05.826 --> 02:08.393
all these impossible
household tasks.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.828
BONNIE:
Joe, make sure you get

02:09.830 --> 02:12.564
all the tire tracks
out of the carpet.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.910
Learn to live with it, Bonnie!

02:24.912 --> 02:26.178
There are tracks!

02:26.180 --> 02:27.880
People make tracks!

02:27.882 --> 02:28.680
Boy, I hear you, too.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.315
It's a lot of work
just to keep

02:30.317 --> 02:32.251
my single guy fridge
sufficiently depressing.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.653
Let's see.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.188
Ex-girlfriend's Yoplait.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.923
Root beer from two Julys ago.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.458
Here we go, expired milk.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.460
(chuckles)

02:41.462 --> 02:43.862
Oh, my God, Jenny,
look how young you look.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.764
I sympathize with y'all.

02:45.766 --> 02:50.169
Donna makes me listen to Gayle
King on XM Radio 19 hours a day.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.870
I tried to kill myself by

02:51.872 --> 02:54.373
swallowing a nail clipper,
but I passed it.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.774
What the hell
happened to us?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.843
We used to be able to do
whatever the hell we wanted.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.811
Now here we are,
in the prime of our lives,

02:59.813 --> 03:01.413
and we're slaves to our women.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.315
I know. An exciting
day for me

03:03.317 --> 03:05.150
is when I watch
wheelchair porn.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.885
Boy, do the sparks
fly on those.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.387
Oh, is it hot?

03:08.389 --> 03:11.557
Nah, it's mostly just chairs
smashing into each other.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.892
Sometimes the director
has to come on camera

03:13.894 --> 03:15.394
just to turn the
chairs around.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.162
Well, why don't we make
our own excitement?

03:17.164 --> 03:18.797
What do you mean?
I don't know, like,

03:18.799 --> 03:19.998
maybe the four
of us should

03:20.000 --> 03:21.166
do something
to reclaim our freedom.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.734
Like go on a road trip,
find some adventure.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.503
Quagmire,
that's a great idea!

03:24.505 --> 03:26.171
Let's do a road trip!
Who's in?

03:28.808 --> 03:29.775
No. No, no.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.443
No, n-not you, Seamus.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.811
SEAMUS:
Ah, poo.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.783
All right, listen up, ladies.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.385
We got something to say and we
ain't taking "no" for an answer.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.620
We are going on a road trip.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.222
We don't know how long
we'll be gone,

03:43.224 --> 03:45.057
and don't expect a call
from us to check in.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.392
This trip is about men
being men.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.428
We will drive
after a couple of beers

03:49.430 --> 03:51.129
and not make a big
federal case about it.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.632
We're gonna sneeze and not
put our hand over (bleep).

03:53.634 --> 03:55.734
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop us!

03:55.736 --> 03:56.735
Yeah, okay with me.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.703
Sure.
Fine.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.904
That'll be nice.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.639
It'll give us a chance
to have some girl time.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.708
Oh. All right, then.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.909
Where are you boys going?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.110
We're going to New Orleans.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.912
The party capital of America.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.147
Home of the
All-You-Can-Pee Street.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.217
I'll tell you one thing, it's
all about the beads down there.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.827
We all know
what's going on here.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.729
It's just implied,
but we all know

04:23.731 --> 04:25.330
what's going on
in this thought bubble.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.399
The kids don't know, but we do.

04:41.648 --> 04:45.117
Boy, I'm sure getting my money's
worth out of this rental car.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.518
Okay, all right,
I got one.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.221
Would you rather be a hobo
with a five percent chance

04:49.223 --> 04:51.123
of getting inherited
by a rich guy

04:51.125 --> 04:54.393
or be Hitler two years before
the end of World War II?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.228
'Cause you know you're gonna
have to shoot yourself,

04:56.230 --> 04:58.063
but you still got two
more years as Hitler.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.631
If you're the hobo, do you, uh,

04:59.633 --> 05:02.301
have a place to sleep,
like an underpass or...?

05:02.303 --> 05:03.335
Different every night.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.803
As Hitler, can I change

05:04.805 --> 05:06.805
certain policies
so that maybe I'm looked on

05:06.807 --> 05:08.573
more favorably
at the end of the war?

05:08.575 --> 05:11.143
No, you already screwed up
big-time-- lot of dead Jews.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.679
Am I a blue state
or a red state hobo?

05:13.681 --> 05:16.415
Blue, but
Midwestern blue.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.749
Oh, boy.
(grumbling)

05:17.751 --> 05:19.818
I don't think so,
it's cold out there.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.353
Am I allowed
to alter the mustache?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.355
Dude, why do you keep
trying to make Hitler work?

05:23.357 --> 05:26.758
Am I allowed to kill other hobos
to increase my odds?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.260
Kill anyone you
like; you're a hobo.

05:28.262 --> 05:29.528
Am I a walking hobo?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.763
No. Quagmire and Cleveland
are, but you're not.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.765
So, wait, I would also
be a paralyzed Hitler?

05:33.767 --> 05:34.966
Yeah.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.768
Would I be
a black Hitler?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.136
Yes. No.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.339
Well, wait a minute,
now how come I got to be

05:40.341 --> 05:41.640
crippled Hitler
and he's still white Hitler?

05:41.642 --> 05:44.109
If you got such a problem with
it, Joe, just be the hobo!

05:44.111 --> 05:45.377
This one isn't very fun.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.045
Wait a minute, where are we?

05:47.047 --> 05:49.648
Yeah, this doesn't look like
the main highway anymore.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.882
You think we made
a wrong turn?

05:50.884 --> 05:51.883
I hope not.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.719
These backwoods parts
of the Deep South

05:53.721 --> 05:55.754
ain't a place
you want to get lost in.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.489
(siren wailing)

05:57.491 --> 05:58.557
Oh, no.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.994
Don't worry
about it, guys.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.130
I read nowhere that Southern
sheriffs really want

06:05.132 --> 06:07.299
to be talked down to by
big-shot Northerners.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.469
Afternoon.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.803
Officer, what is it?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.739
We are in a tremendous
urban rush.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.841
You fellas ain't from
around here, are you?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.743
Hey, Sheriff,
I'm trying to learn Southern.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.111
Is this saying anything?

06:19.113 --> 06:21.413
A-doy-doy-doy-doy!

06:21.415 --> 06:24.049
We're very sorry, Sheriff,
and we want to cooperate

06:24.051 --> 06:25.751
to the fullest extent possible.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.752
You threatening me?

06:26.754 --> 06:27.953
Uh, no, sir.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.554
Who you calling "sir," boy?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.090
I'm an officer of the law,
paid by this county.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.626
And I can't help noticing
you got a headlight out.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.428
Really?
I don't see any...

06:37.697 --> 06:40.432
And I see that turn signal
ain't working neither.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.300
Now, look, sir,

06:42.302 --> 06:43.602
I'm a police officer, too.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.737
I know all the games;
I use them myself.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.073
So what do you say
we just work something out?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.408
So, you're a cop, huh?

06:49.410 --> 06:51.977
Let me see your badge.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.046
Looks like you're
a civilian now.

06:55.048 --> 06:58.116
I'm gonna have to
search your vehicle.

06:59.652 --> 07:00.819
Well, lookie here.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.654
What do we got in this thing?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.523
Oh, come on!
You planted that there!

07:04.525 --> 07:05.590
We had drugs?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.592
Oh, my God,
why am I driving drunk

07:07.594 --> 07:08.860
when I could've been
driving high?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.996
You boys are in
a lot of trouble.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.831
Dispatch,
Sheriff Nichols.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.065
Bringing in four
perpetrators

07:14.067 --> 07:15.767
under suspicion of
drug possession.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.236
Descriptions: one
African-American,

07:18.238 --> 07:20.205
one crippled, one
skinny, one handsome.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.573
Yes.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.708
You're all coming down
to the station with me.

07:23.710 --> 07:24.709
Aw, crap!

07:24.711 --> 07:25.977
Hang on, hang on,
you guys.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.646
Don't worry. I know how to
speak this guy's language.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.715
Keith Urban.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.317
Go on.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.352
Brett Favre.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.320
Uh-huh.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.389
I'm listening.

07:37.391 --> 07:38.957
William H. Macy?

07:38.959 --> 07:41.526
You guys are going
away for a long time.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.572
Look at this, Cleveland.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.640
Front of the bus,
back of the bus,

07:55.642 --> 07:57.476
middle of the bus--
you guys are doing great.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.479
Two weeks in prison
on trumped-up charges.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.414
That trial was a total sham.

08:02.416 --> 08:05.016
Yeah, I knew we were in trouble
the minute I saw the jury.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.154
Well, at least they're
a jury of our peers.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.590
I don't think they see it
that way, Peter.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.664
Hello, gentlemen.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.166
I am the warden.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.002
You are here
because you are criminals.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.370
This is not a resort.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.439
You will be worked harder
than you have ever

08:27.441 --> 08:30.208
been worked in your miserable,
pathetic lives.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.277
And play
harder, right?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.545
I bet.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.446
Step forward, maggot!

08:35.982 --> 08:37.449
(grunts)

08:37.451 --> 08:39.551
Next time, that'll be you.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.620
Well, why wasn't
it him this time?!

08:41.622 --> 08:43.722
Oh, I'm so scared.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.923
(grunting)

08:44.925 --> 08:46.458
Peter, stop it!

08:46.460 --> 08:48.894
Yeah, you're real big when
you got that stick, ain't you?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.362
Okay, I'll stop now.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.567
This is so much fun,
isn't it?

08:55.569 --> 08:56.568
I know.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.669
What should we talk
about next?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.738
I know, let's talk
about actresses.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.072
Ooh, yeah.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.974
I feel like Natalie Portman

09:02.976 --> 09:05.544
thinks she's so much better
than everybody.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.679
She's nothing, and her
husband's a nobody.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.114
Why does Laura
Linney always

09:09.116 --> 09:10.415
look like she's just
finished skiing?

09:10.417 --> 09:11.783
I don't know
who that is.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.419
Really? <i>The Big C?</i>
<i>Love Actually?</i>

09:14.421 --> 09:15.420
No, never heard of her.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.788
Would you know
who she was

09:16.790 --> 09:18.557
if I said Tyler
Perry's Laura Linney?

09:18.559 --> 09:20.191
Ooh, I love her.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.566
Oh, God, it's so hot out here.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.601
Yeah, you knew it was
gonna be hot when you heard

09:29.603 --> 09:32.070
that lonesome slide guitar
and that hawk's cry.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.472
(guitar plays somber riff)

09:34.474 --> 09:36.474
(hawk screeches)

09:36.476 --> 09:38.143
Hey! This ain't break time!

09:38.145 --> 09:40.679

10:27.361 --> 10:28.994
Oh, yeah, thanks.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.228
What the hell is that?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.463
It's a jet pack.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.765
I'll come back for you guys,
I promise.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.805
You're my friend and everything
and I feel bad saying this,

10:40.807 --> 10:43.208
but I wanted to see you fail.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.420
Official prediction:
when they let us out of here,

10:55.422 --> 10:57.455
we're gonna have to go through
the prison gift shop.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.257
(men grumbling)
Oh, I hate doing that.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.992
That's how
they get you.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.428
Man, it's gonna feel so good
to walk out of here tomorrow.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.764
Yeah, you know,
the time actually went by faster

11:05.766 --> 11:07.098
than I would have thought.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.700
Uh, you know something?

11:08.702 --> 11:10.435
We left Quahog to find adventure

11:10.437 --> 11:13.004
and get away from all
those lame chores at home,

11:13.006 --> 11:14.439
but I'll tell you this.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.609
Looking back on it now, I don't
think our lives are so bad.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.577
Yeah, I sure do miss Lois
and the kids.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.879
I'll tell you one thing.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.981
When I get home,
I'm gonna sleep like a log.

11:22.983 --> 11:26.084
Hey, I'm gonna plug in the
night-light if you don't mind.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.252
Actually, you know what?

11:27.254 --> 11:29.954
I'm gonna go ahead and
ask you to not do that.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.490
Knock off that chitchat!
It's lights out!

11:32.492 --> 11:35.093
Oh, hey, Warden, since
it's our last night in here,

11:35.095 --> 11:36.761
can I have a glass of milk?

11:36.763 --> 11:38.430
I feel like having
dream diarrhea.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.831
Last night?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.566
Where do you think
y'all are going?

11:41.568 --> 11:44.769
Says here you got another
30 days on your sentence.

11:44.771 --> 11:47.272
What?! But the court said we're
supposed to go home tomorrow!

11:47.274 --> 11:49.441
Well, the court
ain't here, is it?

11:49.443 --> 11:52.277
(Warden laughs)

11:52.279 --> 11:53.745
Oh, man, how the hell
are we gonna do this

11:53.747 --> 11:54.946
for another 30 days?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.181
(man chuckles)

11:56.183 --> 11:58.116
That's the way
it goes around here.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.052
Once you come in,
you're never allowed to leave.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.755
I got my sentence extended
30 days once.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.124
That was 45 years ago.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.358
Oh, my God,
you hear that?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.127
We're gonna be stuck
in here forever!

12:09.129 --> 12:10.628
Oh, God, what are we gonna do?

12:10.630 --> 12:12.230
Well, I know
what I'm gonna do.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.965
If we're gonna be here a while,

12:13.967 --> 12:16.735
I'm gonna find the biggest guy
here and kick his ass.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.136
Wait a minute.
That's me!

12:18.138 --> 12:20.472
Oh, no, I have a knife!

12:27.079 --> 12:29.047
Oh, what are we gonna do?!

12:29.049 --> 12:31.149
They're gonna keep us
locked up here forever!

12:31.151 --> 12:33.084
We're not staying
in here forever.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.853
We're getting
out of here.
How?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.221
We're breaking out.

12:36.223 --> 12:36.988
What?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.356
Look, sometimes in life,

12:38.358 --> 12:40.759
you got to say, "What the hell,"
and just go for it.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.594
I mean, that's how
we won the Revolutionary War.

12:42.596 --> 12:46.097
Colonel, the British are too
entrenched across the river.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.233
I've told the men
we'll hold our position.

12:52.071 --> 12:54.038
Negative. Tell the men,
we're going across.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.673
But Colonel Goatbanger,
we've...

12:55.675 --> 12:57.208
No, we need to do this,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.177
'cause... for...
'cause of... for strategy.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.551
All right, if we're
gonna break out of here,

13:06.553 --> 13:08.186
we got to get past
these guards.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.454
Well, I got an idea.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.523
It won't be pretty,
but bear with me.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.124
(groaning)

13:13.126 --> 13:15.226
Oh, no, I fell out
of my wheelchair!

13:15.228 --> 13:16.327
(groaning)

13:16.329 --> 13:17.729
(strained groaning, sighs)

13:17.731 --> 13:19.030
Don't help me!

13:19.032 --> 13:20.899
I need to do this on my own!

13:20.901 --> 13:22.901
What are you doing, Joe?
You're embarrassing us.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.469
Oh, really?
Are they looking?

13:27.173 --> 13:30.275
No. They're actually going
to great lengths to avoid it.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.643
Exactly. No one wants

13:31.645 --> 13:34.078
to watch a handicap
struggle for independence.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.248
This will buy us at least
15 minutes of averted gazes.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.117
All right,
I'm gonna nail this home.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.152
Oh! Oh, this is
so humiliating.

13:41.154 --> 13:45.023
I'm about to be an
adult man crying.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.091
(Joe sobs loudly)

13:54.200 --> 13:56.167
I can't walk!

13:56.169 --> 13:58.303
Why the hell
can't I walk?!

13:58.305 --> 14:01.372
This isn't
part of the act anymore!

14:01.374 --> 14:03.274
No, no, no, no,
don't look.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.810
If you make eye contact,
you'll have to help.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.514
Hey, they're
getting away!

14:10.649 --> 14:12.417
Release the dogs!

14:12.419 --> 14:14.819
(barking)

14:15.888 --> 14:18.289
(high-pitched barking)

14:19.758 --> 14:21.860
(barking continues,
chains jangling)

14:35.608 --> 14:37.242
(barking)

14:45.017 --> 14:46.084
Oh, we did it!

14:46.086 --> 14:47.385
Your plan worked, Joe!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.254
I told you those guards
would turn away.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.722
Yeah, Joe, that
was amazing!

14:50.724 --> 14:53.224
That was easier than taking
candy from a premature baby.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.326
(rhythmic beeping)

14:57.363 --> 15:00.832
I'm, uh...
I'm just gonna take this.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.073
(loud laughter)

15:10.643 --> 15:12.710
Hey, I got an idea

15:12.712 --> 15:15.013
for something that's gonna
be so (bleep) funny.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.548
(whispering)

15:17.550 --> 15:19.017
Okay, Bonnie,
go get it.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.418
It's in the closet.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.521
Brian! Brian,
come out here!

15:23.523 --> 15:25.023
What are you doing?!

15:25.025 --> 15:26.357
I'm reading.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.760
What... what... what...

15:28.762 --> 15:30.361
What are you reading?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.664
Well, I was just finishing
Jonathan Franzen's book.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.599
You know, I'll admit
it has its moments,

15:34.601 --> 15:36.100
but it's completely
overrated.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.870
I mean, I'm not saying I
wrote something similar to it

15:38.872 --> 15:40.438
several years ago,
but I am saying...

15:40.440 --> 15:41.806
Grab him!
(laughter)

15:41.808 --> 15:43.975
What? What? What? What?
Hey, what are you doing?! Hey!

15:43.977 --> 15:46.110
Get his paw!
Hold still!
Hey! Hey! Hey! What?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.679
Push him down
onto all fours!
No. What are you do...?

15:47.681 --> 15:49.113
I don't want to do this.
If he really starts
freaking out,

15:49.115 --> 15:50.515
put your pinkie
in his butt!
Aah!

15:50.517 --> 15:51.716
(laughter,
Brian groaning)

15:51.718 --> 15:53.785
Calm down!
Calm down!

15:53.787 --> 15:54.886
(grunting)

15:54.888 --> 15:57.488
(laughter)

15:57.490 --> 15:59.023
Now Stewie!

15:59.025 --> 16:02.193
All right, I guess
this is the night bitches die.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.631
I wonder what the
chain gang did today.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.666
I hope we're not
missing anything cool.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.034
Maybe we should go back.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.703
Hey, guys, look,
there's a house.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.238
Maybe there's something inside

16:14.240 --> 16:16.341
we can use
to get these chains off.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.985
It looks like
nobody's home.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.020
Hey, these look like
handcuff and shackle keys.

16:29.022 --> 16:29.988
How do you know that?

16:29.990 --> 16:31.356
(chuckles)

16:31.358 --> 16:33.491
These are handcuff
and shackle keys.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.560
Hey, it worked!

16:37.129 --> 16:39.263
You know, there's an awful lot
of pictures

16:39.265 --> 16:40.965
of the sheriff in this house.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.133
Well, he's a good-looking man.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.036
I'll bet a lot of people
in town have pictures of him.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.606
Oh, no! It's the sheriff!

16:48.608 --> 16:50.008
Quick, into the closet!

16:57.149 --> 16:58.883
(farting)
Who's there?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.785
PETER (in high-pitched voice):
Just me, sweetie.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.420
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.288
What are you doing
in the closet there?

17:04.290 --> 17:05.890
Um... wife things?

17:05.892 --> 17:08.393
Oh, all right. Well, I'll only
be home for a minute.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.994
Some prisoners escaped
from the work camp,

17:09.996 --> 17:11.929
and I'm helping the warden
track 'em down.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.832
Oh. Well, maybe you
should let 'em go.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.401
You know I can't do that.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.869
You're always working.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.871
I wish you'd spend
more time at home.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.339
More time with me.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.673
Maybe you're right, honey.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.941
Maybe I do work too much.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.343
You know what?

17:25.345 --> 17:27.178
I'm gonna let
those fugitives go.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.679
You'd do that for me?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.381
I'd do anything for you.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.783
I love you.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.184
I love you, too!

17:33.186 --> 17:35.253
Now, come out here
and give me a kiss!

17:35.255 --> 17:36.854
Peter, no!

17:36.856 --> 17:38.890
Wait a minute!
I don't have a wife!

17:38.892 --> 17:41.893
(gunshots)

17:41.895 --> 17:44.262
(gunfire continues)

17:44.264 --> 17:45.696
(sirens wailing)

17:45.698 --> 17:47.532
(tires squealing)

17:53.405 --> 17:55.840
(train whistle blowing)

17:55.842 --> 17:57.542
Head for the tracks!

18:00.179 --> 18:01.312
(gunfire)

18:01.314 --> 18:03.514
Oh, no!
They're shooting at us!

18:03.516 --> 18:05.750
Good thing bad guys are
such terrible shots.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.252
Man, these guys are elusive!

18:08.254 --> 18:09.954
Quick!
Hop on!

18:16.762 --> 18:19.163
All right,
we did it.
We made it.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.065
That was a
close one!

18:21.067 --> 18:22.733
(sighs)
Well, guys, we made it.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.036
Boy, I feel like
I haven't eaten in a week.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.671
Hey, if we pass
a McDaniel's

18:26.673 --> 18:28.372
or a Burger Queen,
let's hop out.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.141
Oh, that's right,
we're on television.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.143
Oh, I'd love a
flame-broiled Bopper!

18:32.145 --> 18:35.446
So frustrating. We all know
what we're talking about.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.548
(train chugging,
train whistle blowing quietly)

18:40.052 --> 18:43.955
Well, this was
quite an adventure.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.324
Yeah, it's good to be
back in familiar territory.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.559
(gun chambers cocking)

18:48.561 --> 18:50.027
Where do y'all think
you're going?

18:50.029 --> 18:52.230
You boys are fugitives
of my county,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.499
and I'm gonna take you back.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.700
Oh, no!

18:55.702 --> 18:56.901
I don't think so.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.904
You're in my jurisdiction now,
Sheriff Butt Breath.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.844
Wow, Joe,
how'd you pull that off?

19:06.846 --> 19:09.013
I put in a call from
the McDaniel's pay phone

19:09.015 --> 19:11.682
while you guys were getting that
nine-piece chicken McFingers

19:11.684 --> 19:14.352
and those Diet Conks
and those Fresh Fries.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.921
Oh, come on. They-They
don't own "French fries!"

19:16.923 --> 19:19.924
You know, you got some nerve
driving around my town

19:19.926 --> 19:22.927
with a busted headlight.

19:22.929 --> 19:26.164
And a busted windshield.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.666
And an untreated flesh wound.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.768
(groaning)

19:30.770 --> 19:33.871
You took an oath just
the same as me, Sheriff.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.206
To protect and serve.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.741
Not to harass and douche.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.709
Just 'cause you have
a badge doesn't mean

19:38.711 --> 19:40.611
you can treat people
any way you like.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.480
And as a law enforcement
professional,

19:42.482 --> 19:44.815
you have an obligation to be
more ethically upstanding

19:44.817 --> 19:47.885
than the average man, not less.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.855
Now, get the hell
out of my town.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.765
Nice going, Joe!

20:00.767 --> 20:02.833
Well, it's great
being back in the North

20:02.835 --> 20:04.502
where people
are civilized.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.538
Hey, what, are you guys
all on a date?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.774
Gay!

20:12.878 --> 20:14.946
Oh, my God, Peter,
what an experience.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.882
But the important thing is
you're home safe.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.751
Yeah. And you know, I guess I
learned something from all this.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.119
(sighs)
You know what?

20:22.121 --> 20:24.088
We've done this a billion
times, so you know what?

20:24.090 --> 20:26.891
I'm just gonna
do the cadences.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.993
(speaking gibberish)

20:30.362 --> 20:32.463
(speaking gibberish)

20:33.732 --> 20:35.833
(speaking gibberish)

20:37.703 --> 20:39.237
(speaking gibberish)

20:39.239 --> 20:42.740
(speaking
gibberish)
