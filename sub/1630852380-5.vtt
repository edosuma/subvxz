WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:02.627
(grunts softly)

00:09.134 --> 00:10.218
Good morning, hermana.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.555
In your chair.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.764
I bought you your favorite,
caramel macchiato,

00:14.806 --> 00:16.099
to start off the day.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.561
I'm not a monster.
Plus, I wanted a muffin.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.771
Beto, please. You don't
understand what you're doing.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.064
Oh, I understand.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.066
I'm getting
the family company back.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.276
My inheritance.

00:26.317 --> 00:29.070
You can have the damn company.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.780
But Rita wants my life.

00:30.822 --> 00:31.489
She told me

00:31.489 --> 00:35.285
she's gonna kill me
and take my place permanently.

00:37.412 --> 00:40.165
Oh, you'll say anything to get
out of here, won't you?

00:40.206 --> 00:41.624
Luckily,

00:41.666 --> 00:44.794
I'm not as gullible
as your husband.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.546
Blake made an
appointment in two days

00:46.588 --> 00:48.548
to sign the
transfer paperwork.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.551
You'll be let out once I'm
safely on my way back to Mexico.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.927
You think you'll be safe there?

00:52.969 --> 00:54.471
Once I tell Papá
what you've done...

00:54.512 --> 00:57.182
Oh, Papá this,
Blake that.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.017
You're like a broken record.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.560
And I'm not worried.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.687
No one's gonna
believe your story.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.982
A woman that looks just
like you took over your life?

01:06.608 --> 01:09.110
The only one getting
locked up here will be you.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.655
You know, on second thought,
I'm gonna keep this for myself.

01:12.697 --> 01:13.990
(laughs softly)

01:19.079 --> 01:21.247
(birds chirping)

01:21.289 --> 01:23.416
I've got a question for you.
BLAKE:
Perfect timing.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.751
I have a question for you.

01:24.793 --> 01:25.752
Not sure how
that's perfect timing for me,

01:25.794 --> 01:27.212
but okay.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.838
I'm putting the Carrington
vacation compound

01:28.880 --> 01:31.341
on the market next week,
and rolling the profits over

01:31.382 --> 01:33.927
into to the construction budget
for the new PPA airport.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.929
Is there anything in
the house that you want
before it's cleaned out?

01:35.970 --> 01:39.933
Wow, I haven't thought about
that place in years, so no.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.435
That's the past
and I am focused on the future,

01:42.477 --> 01:44.938
which leads us
back to my question,

01:44.979 --> 01:47.565
which is about the past. Um...

01:47.607 --> 01:50.401
Were you and Alexis

01:50.443 --> 01:53.238
on the same page
when you decided to have kids?

01:54.405 --> 01:56.032
Am I about to be a grandfather?

01:56.074 --> 01:57.909
Do I need to set up
custodial accounts?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.285
No, no, no. Relax. Although...

01:59.327 --> 02:01.412
I did bring up
the subject with Liam.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.456
And?
And he went to Los Angeles

02:03.498 --> 02:04.916
to meet with
his movie producers,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.668
and I haven't heard
from him since.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.878
Well, funny enough,
having kids was the one time

02:08.920 --> 02:11.047
Alexis and I were
in total agreement.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.632
In fact,

02:12.674 --> 02:15.343
Adam was conceived
at the Carrington compound.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.929
Ew. Yet another reason
to get rid of the place.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.097
(phone vibrates, chimes)

02:19.139 --> 02:21.558
Okay. Liam is on his way home.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.685
So thankfully,
we can stop talking about this

02:23.726 --> 02:25.520
before you tell me
where I was conceived.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.647
Oh...
Don't.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.151
DOMINIQUE:
I'm really enjoying our weekly

02:31.192 --> 02:33.444
Dom-Mystique
business breakfasts.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.571
Yeah, me, too.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.698
And also, congratulations

02:36.739 --> 02:39.534
on your glowing
Wall Street Journal profile,

02:39.576 --> 02:42.620
Mr. Savior of
Fallon Unlimited.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.247
(chuckles)
Thanks.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.291
All I did was stabilize
the company stock price

02:46.332 --> 02:48.918
and keep morale high
while Fallon's away.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.629
As a mother, I'm proud
you've restored your reputation.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.256
As a business partner,

02:53.298 --> 02:55.717
I was a little dismayed
to see no mention

02:55.758 --> 02:57.427
of Dom-Mystique.
Calling out the success

02:57.468 --> 03:00.096
of my mother while talking
about Fallon Unlimited

03:00.138 --> 03:02.974
would not have been
the most professional look.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.601
Enough about me.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.853
What's going on
with the NordicStar contract?

03:06.895 --> 03:10.440
I'm about to expand
my international profile

03:10.481 --> 03:14.152
by selling direct-to-consumer
on IG Live.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.570
That should get
some attention.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.280
I am going to make that airline

03:17.322 --> 03:19.574
notice Dom-Mystique
whether they want to or not.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.075
Sounds like a good move.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.410
Maybe you can call the Journal

03:22.452 --> 03:24.078
and tell them to redo
the article.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.081
I'm kidding.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.834
(laughs)
Cheers.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.878
And here you go.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.922
Enjoy your new suite.
It's a great one.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.506
A suite?

03:35.548 --> 03:38.426
I can't believe how generous
Ms. Carrington is.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.012
I didn't expect an upgrade
to come with the, uh, the job.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.847
Well, now that you're
staying here long term,

03:42.889 --> 03:44.641
you deserve a little more space.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.143
Fallon wants only the best,
including for her horse trainer.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.020
Well, she sounds like a great
friend to have in your life.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.772
Thanks.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.527
Um, did I just see Carter Tatum

03:56.569 --> 03:59.155
in the restaurant
doing a photo shoot?

03:59.197 --> 04:01.115
If you mean the gay Insta icon
that is the spokesman

04:01.157 --> 04:03.660
for the collab between La Mirage
and Tres Gatos Tequila,

04:03.701 --> 04:05.286
then yes.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.746
His feed is all I want
my life to be.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.164
Tell me about it.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.499
He's always out at a club,
on a yacht,

04:09.540 --> 04:11.542
or hanging out
in Turks and Caicos.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.503
I'm so jealous.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.255
Where is Turks and Caicos?

04:15.296 --> 04:17.215
I don't know,
but I'd go to either one.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.218
My life has been
all hotel for so long

04:20.260 --> 04:22.220
that if I don't
start having fun,

04:22.262 --> 04:24.013
I'm gonna burn out
by the time I'm 32.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.890
Wait, Sammy Jo,
I thought you were 32.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.725
Hush, child.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.394
My point is,
if Fallon Carrington

04:29.435 --> 04:32.480
can find some work-life balance,
then I definitely can.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.774
Let's see. "Turks...

04:34.816 --> 04:37.193
and Caicos."

04:42.824 --> 04:44.075
Shrimp?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.076
I think we should
cancel the meeting

04:45.118 --> 04:46.202
with Beto and the lawyers.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.290
Why? I thought it was settled.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.791
I just can't shake
this feeling that Beto's

04:51.833 --> 04:53.501
got some trick up his sleeve.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.545
Look, we know he
doesn't play fair.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.255
I don't think you should
give him the company.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.632
I understand your concern,

04:59.674 --> 05:03.094
but I think we're making
the right decision.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.387
What are you doing?
You can't drink that.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.847
What? Why not?

05:05.888 --> 05:07.140
We just talked about

05:07.181 --> 05:08.141
how grapefruit juice
is dangerous

05:08.182 --> 05:09.809
to mix with your meds.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.687
Wow, I-I think the stress
of dealing with the company

05:12.729 --> 05:14.439
is making me forgetful.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.441
Just grabbing some food
on the way to the office.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.651
Yeah, hold on one second.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.237
Is it possible that Cristal
is having a reaction

05:21.279 --> 05:22.947
to her cancer meds?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.366
She was dizzy a few
nights ago, and now,

05:25.408 --> 05:26.659
now she's forgetful.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.829
No, it's not a big deal.
It's stress.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.539
Well, we can never
be too careful.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.958
It is almost time for your
six-month post-op checkup.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.543
Why don't you come in, we'll
get some blood work done.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.628
I can give you a ride to
the hospital right now.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.756
Oh...
(exhales)

05:39.797 --> 05:42.300
I have a manicure
appointment in an hour.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.887
Everyone's overreacting.
I'm fine.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.305
Thank you, Adam.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.140
Okay.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.808
I just want to sign
the paperwork.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.227
No. I'm not signing
anything right now.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.688
Until you have
a clean bill of health,

05:55.730 --> 05:57.231
it is not happening.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.151
If you can't go in today,
you're going in tomorrow.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.029
Of course, honey.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.990
Thank you for always
looking out for me.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.451
They want to start production
as soon as possible,

06:08.493 --> 06:10.370
since Nina has a couple
of directing projects lined up.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.579
Which means I have
to finish work

06:11.621 --> 06:12.789
on the screenplay right away.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.165
So between that and traveling

06:14.207 --> 06:15.875
back and forth to
L.A. for meetings,

06:15.917 --> 06:18.836
(laughs): I mean, my schedule
is about to be crazy.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.589
Look at you, crazy busy.
It's kind of hot.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.844
Uh, speaking of crazy,

06:26.886 --> 06:29.597
did you happen to think
about that question

06:29.639 --> 06:31.432
I brought up before you left?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.642
It's okay if you didn't.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.769
No, I did.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.062
Oh.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.732
I thought about it
a lot, actually,

06:39.774 --> 06:42.860
and I was pretty clear
in the past

06:42.902 --> 06:44.862
about my feelings
on having kids.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.281
You were.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.075
And I'm just,
I'm about to be really busy.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.203
No, I understand.
It's just not the right time.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.205
I said "about to be busy."

06:54.247 --> 06:59.669
Which makes this the perfect
time to try and get pregnant.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.295
Oh, my God.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.797
Are you serious?
Yeah.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.132
Really?
Yes.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.717
Ooh.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.012
Okay, not that I'm complaining,
but what changed your mind?

07:10.054 --> 07:12.014
Well, let's just say
you weren't the only one

07:12.056 --> 07:15.309
that was affected by your
near-death experience.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.478
I'm ready to expand our family.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.356
Well, the next three days are
my most fertile of the month.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.151
Did you already get
one of those ovulation kits?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.194
'Cause clearly you were
expecting a yes from me.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.405
No, I didn't, but way to ruin
the mood with science.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.781
No, I just know my body,

07:28.823 --> 07:32.034
and right now
my body is all about sex.

07:32.076 --> 07:35.329
I am as fertile as the Pampas
in Argentina.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.123
Hmm, we're gonna have a baby!

07:37.165 --> 07:40.334
Or at least have an
amazing time trying.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.674
♪ ♪

08:08.237 --> 08:12.783
I cannot wait
till Jazz Night tomorrow.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.285
It's gonna be hot.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.079
Huh? Oh, yeah.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.165
Carter is really hot.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.458
Who?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.043
I was talking
about music, man.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.711
SAM:
And I'm talking about Carter,

08:23.753 --> 08:26.589
that hot model over there
I need to ask out on a date.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.382
I've been trying to figure out
how to live my life like him,

08:28.424 --> 08:30.259
but maybe I can live
it with him instead.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.554
Did my, uh, search for
"the one" inspire you?

08:33.596 --> 08:37.016
Yes, to do exactly
the opposite.

08:37.058 --> 08:41.229
Sammy Jo needs some fun
in his life, so wish me luck.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.688
Hey. Good to see you again.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.023
Sam.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.193
SAM:
You want to grab a drink?

08:47.235 --> 08:48.486
CARTER:
Yes, let's.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.989
Hey.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.824
So, I ran your
IG Live plan

08:53.866 --> 08:56.953
by the legal department,
and they told me your contract

08:56.994 --> 09:00.748
prohibits you from selling your
merchandise anywhere but FSN.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.459
You're gonna have
to scrap this idea.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.044
Well, that's not happening.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.504
It's a breach of contract,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.130
and I can't let that happen
on my watch.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.298
Well, what if you looked
the other way?

09:09.340 --> 09:11.384
You know, not watching?

09:11.425 --> 09:13.052
I can't not watch
what I've already seen,

09:13.094 --> 09:14.554
and I can't play favorites, Mom.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.222
Of course you can.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.808
I'm your mother
and business partner.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.185
What's good for
Dom-Mystique is good for you.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.980
I'm rebuilding my professional
reputation at Fallon Unlimited.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.148
I'm not gonna throw
that away by-by putting

09:26.190 --> 09:27.984
my own personal interests first.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.820
Fine, then put mine first.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.530
Talk to Fallon.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.490
Explain the situation.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.617
You're very persuasive
when you want to be.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.537
Yeah, clearly. Uh...

09:39.579 --> 09:41.289
Okay, look, I-I'll give it
another shot

09:41.330 --> 09:42.707
with Fallon, but I...

09:42.748 --> 09:44.542
Wonderful.
Let me know when it's a go.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.381
Try this. It's a Sazerac,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.508
an authentic
New Orleans cocktail.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.176
SAM:
Mmm.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.512
I like.
Perfect for Jazz Night.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.056
See? I was listening.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.517
Thank you. And thank you
for helping me set up.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.811
Of course. I'm here for you.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.354
But I do need
to multitask

10:05.396 --> 10:07.023
and get ready for my date
with Carter tomorrow.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.609
Here are your outfit options
for Rollerblading.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.944
Rollerblading?
Why not just wear sweatpants?

10:11.986 --> 10:13.988
Ew, gross.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.740
No, no, no, no.
He's obviously kidding.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.658
I mean, you're kidding, right?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.660
Do you want me to wear
some elbow pads, too?

10:19.702 --> 10:21.495
I mean, that's not
the worst idea.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.832
What? I'm kind of
a stickler for safety.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.208
Okay, thanks, Dad.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.627
Sam's picture is gonna be
posted online

10:27.668 --> 10:29.920
and seen by all
of Carter's followers

10:29.962 --> 10:31.172
and who knows who else?

10:31.213 --> 10:32.965
So I need to look aspirational,

10:33.007 --> 10:34.967
not like someone dressed
by his overprotective mother.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.510
Or business partner.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.263
(clears throat)

10:40.389 --> 10:42.725
Oh, Daniel. Hi.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.019
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.355
No, of course not.
Can I help you with anything?

10:47.396 --> 10:49.231
Everything okay with the suite?

10:49.273 --> 10:51.734
Oh, the suite is perfect. Uh...
I was looking for you, actually.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.279
I was wondering if you might
like to get some dinner later?

10:55.321 --> 10:56.781
SAM:
Wow, uh... (chuckles)

10:56.822 --> 10:59.241
Well, thank you,
I am very flattered.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.701
But, uh,
tonight's not good.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.496
I have a lot
of hotel business going on,

11:03.537 --> 11:05.373
but maybe some other time?

11:05.414 --> 11:06.749
Of course. Uh, I-I'm sorry,

11:06.791 --> 11:07.875
I didn't mean to put you
on the spot.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.418
(chuckles):
No, no, no.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.962
No problem at all.
I didn't feel on the spot.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.381
Totally spotless.
(chuckles)

11:13.422 --> 11:15.466
So, have a good night.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.967
Take care.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.261
MICHAEL:
Why'd you say no?

11:19.303 --> 11:21.222
You just said you were
looking for someone.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.350
I said I was looking for fun,
and I'm pretty sure dating

11:24.392 --> 11:26.519
Fallon's horse trainer
isn't the best way to find it.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.146
Oh, he could be
fun. But he's old.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.024
No, I just don't want
to split my focus

11:32.066 --> 11:34.360
while I'm dating Carter,
that's all.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.987
Now I need to head out
for my manicure and facial.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.490
We're still setting up.
Just do all that tomorrow.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.451
I am getting an $1,800
overnight, ultra-hydrating,

11:42.493 --> 11:46.831
vitamin C, hyaluronic
firming mask, so I got to go...

11:46.872 --> 11:48.499
now.
Of course.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.793
Well, why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.796
♪ ♪

11:57.341 --> 11:59.009
Mmm.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.846
You have really gone
all out here. I feel bad.

12:01.887 --> 12:05.850
Is there anything special
that I can do for you?

12:05.891 --> 12:09.103
Actually, yes.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.689
In order to increase the chances
of getting pregnant,

12:11.731 --> 12:14.442
I read that it's helpful
for the man to pray

12:14.483 --> 12:18.821
to the gods of fertility
at the moment of climax.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.866
Um... I'm not...

12:21.907 --> 12:23.534
I was kidding.
It was a joke. Lighten up.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.453
We're supposed to be
having fun, remember?

12:25.494 --> 12:27.538
Okay, well,
I'll show you some fun.
(knocking on door)

12:27.580 --> 12:30.374
Uh, whoever it is,
please go away.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.376
Adam?

12:32.418 --> 12:33.544
Did you not say "Come in"?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.337
Nope. Not even close.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.630
Well, Blake mentioned
something about

12:36.672 --> 12:37.840
becoming a grandfather soon,

12:37.882 --> 12:39.091
so I just wanted
to offer my advice

12:39.133 --> 12:40.509
as a trained physician.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.927
My advice would be
for you to get out.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.679
I will, but I think
you should know

12:43.721 --> 12:45.681
the positions that are most
conducive to...

12:45.723 --> 12:46.766
Ew! Get out!

12:46.807 --> 12:48.559
(exclaiming)

12:48.601 --> 12:49.810
You don't have to tell me twice.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.395
No, more like five times.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.189
Mind if I just have a...
Goodbye, Adam.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.482
Ah, ah... Ow.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.278
Do you still want to...?
Do you?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.905
Not unless you want me to think

13:00.946 --> 13:03.157
of your brother
at the moment of climax.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.701
Well, if the mood wasn't dead
already, you just murdered it.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.453
New plan.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.121
We leave tomorrow at dawn.

13:09.163 --> 13:13.626
I know exactly where
we can go to get some privacy.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.044
Why wouldn't you push
the blood work

13:15.085 --> 13:17.254
until after the meeting
with the lawyers?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.215
We don't even know if you and
Cristal are the same blood type.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.925
RITA:
I tried to stall, but
Blake wouldn't budge.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.469
But I do have some good news.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.932
It's amazing what that hospital
will do for a Carrington,

13:27.973 --> 13:30.184
especially one
who started a clinic.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.562
Here's everything we need
for an at-home blood draw.

13:33.604 --> 13:37.107
(laughs)
Well done.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.777
You know who's been
just a doll to me?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.403
Your stepson.

13:41.445 --> 13:44.365
He's so concerned
about my well-being.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.034
Did you two ever...

13:47.076 --> 13:48.911
you know?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.746
I kind of get that vibe.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.748
You're disgusting.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.334
I'm just trying to get
the lay of the land.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.586
Don't be so prissy.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.839
Beto,

13:59.880 --> 14:02.132
you must realize this is insane.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.718
BETO:
Well, I'm not gonna let a
little blood stop me now.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.721
I wouldn't move around
too much if I were you.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.015
I don't want to jab
you in the wrong spot.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.183
After all,

14:11.225 --> 14:12.643
I'm not a professional.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.937
(laughs)

14:23.320 --> 14:27.157
Wow, this house is beautiful.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.784
Well, when you talked
about "the old place,"

14:28.826 --> 14:30.202
I thought it would be shabbier.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.829
Well, it's
Carrington shabby.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.998
And it's only beautiful
because no one else is here.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.167
Aw. I used to nap
on that couch

14:37.209 --> 14:38.752
while my grandmother
scratched my back.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.838
That's such a sweet memory.
Yeah, it's great.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.381
Let's do it.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.594
No complaints here.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.846
I have one
I'd like to register.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.972
Winston?

14:50.014 --> 14:50.973
Who's Winston?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.516
Winston is the man

14:52.558 --> 14:54.310
who wants to know
if it's safe to look up again.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.062
Winston has been the caretaker
here since I was a child.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.565
And yes, yes, you can
uncover your eyes.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.108
This is my husband Liam.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.359
WINSTON:
Oh.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.611
A pleasure.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.154
And, uh, nice to see

15:05.195 --> 15:07.239
someone clearly uses
his gym membership.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.490
(chuckles)
Uh, I'm sorry

15:08.532 --> 15:09.783
to disturb you, Ms. Carrington.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.993
I-I didn't realize
you'd be here.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.411
Yeah, well, back
at you, Winnie.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.121
We were hoping that
we would be alone.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.623
So maybe you could
just head off

15:15.664 --> 15:17.124
to the staff quarters
for a little bit

15:17.166 --> 15:18.626
and take a tiny,
little nap,

15:18.667 --> 15:20.252
you know, while Liam and
I try to make a baby.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.046
Unfortunately, no can do.
I-I've already cleared out

15:22.087 --> 15:23.589
that wing of the house
in preparation for the sale,

15:23.631 --> 15:25.090
and I only have two days left

15:25.132 --> 15:26.842
to make things happen here.
FALLON:
Well,

15:26.884 --> 15:29.261
we only have two days left
to make things happen, too.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.763
(chuckles softly)

15:30.804 --> 15:32.431
Do you want to just get

15:32.473 --> 15:34.099
a hotel room downtown
or something?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.684
Do we really want to tell
our future child

15:35.726 --> 15:37.728
that they were conceived
in a chain hotel?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.438
What is with men
wanting to tell their children

15:39.480 --> 15:40.898
where they were conceived?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.358
But I get your point.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.485
It's just a little icky

15:44.526 --> 15:46.111
with Winston here
packing up.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.864
You understand.
WINSTON:
Most definitely.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.449
I wouldn't want me here, either,

15:50.491 --> 15:53.410
distracting you
from this cool drink of water.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.745
(chuckles)

15:54.787 --> 15:57.164
Hey, what if
we help Winston pack up?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.207
Get him out of here

15:58.248 --> 15:59.333
in one day instead of two?

15:59.375 --> 16:00.834
Really? You would do that?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.544
Yeah.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.129
Brawn and brains.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.715
Hmm, we have a winner.
(chuckles)

16:06.757 --> 16:08.258
Uh...

16:08.300 --> 16:10.094
Well, why don't you two
start in this room,

16:10.135 --> 16:12.554
and I-I'll just be
in the next room over.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.931
Hmm.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.683
I think you've got
a friend for life.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.142
Let's start packing

16:17.184 --> 16:19.186
this up so we can get
this stuff and him

16:19.228 --> 16:21.730
out of here as
fast as possible.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.401
Mmm.
(chuckles)

16:25.442 --> 16:28.112
I haven't been Rollerblading
in ages.
Hmm.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.905
I could tell by the way
you ran straight into a bush.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.784
Twice.
That bush was hidden
by a group of children.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.285
That's really
what I was aiming for.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.537
Mm.
(gasps softly)

16:36.578 --> 16:38.122
We got some cute
pictures, though.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.540
Really? Let me see.
Uh-uh.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.458
I have them set to publish
in an hour.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.626
You know how it is.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.795
Oh, yeah. I-I get it.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.463
I'll check then.
I have to run

16:46.505 --> 16:49.299
to another engagement,
but I'm hosting an event

16:49.341 --> 16:50.926
at a pop-up bar
in Midtown later tonight.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.928
You want to stop by?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.221
That sounds like fun.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.973
Mm.
And I am all

16:56.015 --> 16:58.058
about fun.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.852
(chuckles)

16:59.893 --> 17:01.270
In that case,

17:01.311 --> 17:03.063
I'm headed to Belize
with some friends

17:03.105 --> 17:05.065
next weekend on the PJ.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.817
It'll be the most fun.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.402
Come.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.113
OM-extra letter-G.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

17:11.155 --> 17:12.281
I'm in.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.949
I mean, a-a trip to Belize

17:13.991 --> 17:15.743
is exactly the kind of vacay
I've been looking for.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.954
Perfect. Uh, just don't forget
to change before tonight.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.956
Uh, I just don't
want you to get

17:20.998 --> 17:22.833
trolled for wearing
the same outfit twice.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.626
(scoffs):
Oh. No, please.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.087
I never wear
the same thing twice.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.339
Unless there's a fashion crisis,
but...

17:29.381 --> 17:31.467
Yeah, don't worry.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.510
I'll bring even more
clothing choices to Belize.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.221
You actually won't need
that many clothes on the trip.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.646
Mm. Ooh, I feel
a bit light-headed.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.106
Would you like me to get you
some apple juice?

17:46.148 --> 17:48.484
That would be wonderful.
Thank you.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.451
Surprise.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.702
(Rita exhales)

17:58.744 --> 18:01.830
Oh, you startled me.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.999
(chuckles):
I'm sorry. I saw your nurse.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.418
Just wanted to, uh,
check in on you,

18:06.460 --> 18:08.962
give you your apple juice.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.714
Um...
Are you...
Are you still feeling dizzy?

18:10.756 --> 18:12.758
I'm feeling a little weak.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.219
Oh, I'm so pathetic.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.137
No, no.
Can you

18:17.179 --> 18:19.223
hand me that juice?
Yes, of course.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.227
It is completely normal
for you to feel light-headed

18:23.268 --> 18:25.729
after having
your blood drawn.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.318
Here you go.
(exhales)

18:32.277 --> 18:33.487
My hero.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.073
Mmm.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.616
I'm feeling better already.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.451
Great.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.578
And, uh,
I can take that for you.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.915
Oh.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.208
(chuckles):
Yeah.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.961
Mmm.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.547
You want me to call Blake
to pick you up?

18:51.588 --> 18:53.674
Oh, don't worry.
I have the driver.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.718
I'll see you at home.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.011
Yep.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.854
Thanks for doing this
with me.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.730
If I'm gonna be photographed
all the time,

19:08.772 --> 19:11.066
I need to burn
an extra 400 calories a day.
Please.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.442
I'm not just here for you.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.153
Now that I'm getting
back into modeling,

19:14.194 --> 19:15.946
I need to take new pictures
so I can get an agent again.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.614
Well,
I'll just keep telling myself

19:17.656 --> 19:19.074
you're here for moral support

19:19.116 --> 19:20.492
because it helps me
get through the workout.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.911
(phone vibrating, ringing)

19:22.953 --> 19:25.330
(panting):
It's Carter.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.915
What do I do?

19:26.957 --> 19:29.334
Answer it?
Okay.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.336
Hello?

19:31.378 --> 19:33.630
Hey.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.008
No, I'm not breathing hard.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.178
Oh, no.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.264
Well, we can just move it
to The Sahara Club.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.349
No, no, no, it's not a problem.
Not at all.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.851
Okay, great.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.812
See you then. Bye.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.148
What was that?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.858
The pop-up bar popped down,

19:52.900 --> 19:55.861
so I offered The Sahara Club
for tonight.
Um,

19:55.903 --> 19:58.197
isn't tonight Culhane's
Jazz Night at the club?

19:58.238 --> 19:59.823
Nah, we can push it a day.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.743
Jazz is timeless, right?
Well,

20:02.784 --> 20:04.161
in that case, I'll
be there, too.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.079
A few well-tagged pics
with the Insta-crowd

20:06.121 --> 20:07.456
will help me impress
a new agent.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.666
I feel so used.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.002
But I kind of like it.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.047
FALLON:
Oh, wow.

20:15.088 --> 20:18.467
It's me when I won the Georgia
Young Businesswoman Prize.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.843
You look like you're ten
in that photo.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.803
I was eight.
(gasps)

20:21.845 --> 20:24.056
(chuckles):
Aw. Look.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.183
It's a drawing I did
of my first horse,

20:26.225 --> 20:27.893
Pepperoni.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.479
What? I was really into pizza.
Seems like

20:30.520 --> 20:32.773
you have a lot of nice memories
from this place.
Yeah.

20:32.814 --> 20:33.941
I do.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.401
Let's make a new one
right now.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.612
(Liam moaning)

20:40.572 --> 20:42.074
Please

20:42.115 --> 20:43.450
don't tell me it's Winston.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.244
Look at that.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.875
There's nothing there.
Exactly.

20:51.917 --> 20:56.171
That is where the Carrington
family crest has been forever.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.839
I know that we
didn't pack it.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.342
Winston said he hasn't packed
in here. So where is it?

21:00.384 --> 21:01.760
We're just gonna
skip over the fact

21:01.802 --> 21:03.762
that there's
a Carrington family crest?

21:03.804 --> 21:05.013
Oh, yeah, we are.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.431
Because the ivory chess set

21:06.473 --> 21:09.643
that Anders used
to teach Blake how to play

21:09.685 --> 21:11.478
was always right there.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.355
Nana Carrington's
crystal candelabra

21:13.397 --> 21:15.440
has always been right here.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.650
And the gold-plated
cookie cutters,

21:16.692 --> 21:17.985
they weren't in the kitchen.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.653
Where is everything?
It's all missing.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.071
Who would steal all this stuff?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.948
Maybe someone

21:22.990 --> 21:25.033
with an intimate knowledge
of this house

21:25.075 --> 21:27.661
and a crush on you.
(chuckles):
You mean Winston?

21:27.703 --> 21:30.038
Mm-hmm.
Oh, Fallon,
why would he do that?

21:30.080 --> 21:31.540
He's probably pissed
that he's out of a job

21:31.581 --> 21:33.458
and a place to live,
so he helped himself

21:33.500 --> 21:35.043
to a severance package.
Okay.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.253
Then we should call the police.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.672
Or...

21:38.714 --> 21:42.718
we could wait until he goes
on his little nightly patrol,

21:42.759 --> 21:44.845
sneak into the staff quarters,

21:44.886 --> 21:46.930
and see if he's been hiding
everything in there.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.807
I'm guessing we're going
with option "B."

21:48.849 --> 21:50.100
Yeah.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.643
What about
your fertility window?

21:51.685 --> 21:52.561
Oh, that thing's open
for another two days.

21:52.602 --> 21:53.979
Besides, I can't focus

21:54.021 --> 21:55.397
if all my family heirlooms
are missing.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.649
So let's go find everything,
catch him,

21:57.691 --> 22:00.027
and then get back to making
a family heirloom of our own.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.533
BLAKE:
Well, Adam said
that you nearly fainted.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.535
I was nervous.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.038
Who knows what the
results will say?

22:11.079 --> 22:13.915
Adam was just making a
big deal over nothing.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.459
ADAM:
I was concerned.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.918
But it turns out you were right.
It was nothing.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.463
Blood work came
back normal.
(Rita sighs)

22:19.504 --> 22:20.756
It's great news.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.466
That's wonderful news.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.554
Have you been working out?

22:28.013 --> 22:30.640
(chuckles): Anyways, I'll,
uh, I'll leave you two

22:30.682 --> 22:33.435
to celebrate.
Well, I am relieved.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.937
Not as relieved as I'll be
once we meet with the lawyer.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.230
You promised

22:37.272 --> 22:38.565
you'd hand over the company

22:38.607 --> 22:40.025
once I got a clean
bill of health.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.444
You heard Adam. I'm fine.

22:42.486 --> 22:46.114
The only headache I have is
the company weighing me down.

22:46.156 --> 22:49.618
Okay. You're right. I agreed.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.703
I'll confirm the appointment
with the lawyers

22:51.745 --> 22:52.871
for tomorrow morning.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.707
Thank you, darling.
Mm.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.501
♪ You ♪

22:57.542 --> 22:59.795

SAM:
Mmm.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.595
Daniel. I'm surprised
to see you here.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.140
I didn't think you were
into the, uh, influencer scene.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.558
Oh, I don't think I am,

23:13.600 --> 23:14.684
considering I don't
know what that is.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.103
(both chuckle)

23:16.144 --> 23:17.979
I thought it was,
uh, Jazz Night.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.190
Oh, yeah, that, um,
got postponed.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.276
I needed to accommodate
for a very important client.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.695
You impress me, Sam.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.322
I can see how hard you work,

23:27.364 --> 23:29.658
but it's nice to see you
having a little bit of fun, too.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.244
I've been a workaholic myself.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.996
You have?
Still am, if I'm
being honest.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.915
I spent so much time with horses

23:36.957 --> 23:39.918
that I missed out on some
of my personal relationships.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.422
I think I was more comfortable
with the horses, to be honest.

23:43.463 --> 23:45.590
They, uh, can't hurt you.

23:45.632 --> 23:46.925
Well,

23:46.967 --> 23:48.176
unless you get kicked
in the head.

23:48.218 --> 23:51.012
(chuckles)
Good point.
I...

23:51.054 --> 23:53.265
I regret some of the decisions
that I made,

23:53.306 --> 23:56.309
but, uh,
I'm trying to change that.

23:56.351 --> 23:59.646
Yeah. I'm trying
to change things, too.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.357
So I guess we have that
in common. (chuckles)

24:02.399 --> 24:04.317
It's not as easy as it sounds,
right?
Mm.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.612
Well, I'm sure you have to
get back to your friends.

24:07.654 --> 24:11.158
I hope you'll consider
grabbing that dinner sometime.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.372
I don't understand.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.499
Fallon won't grant me
an exception,

24:19.541 --> 24:21.501
so therefore you

24:21.543 --> 24:23.003
won't grant me
an exception?

24:23.044 --> 24:25.630
Seems like you do understand.

24:25.672 --> 24:26.673
Don't get cute with me.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.757
Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

24:27.799 --> 24:29.509
A contract is a contract.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.679
I just don't think
there's another solution.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.222
This isn't a solution.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.724
The solution is,

24:35.765 --> 24:37.726
we'll dissolve our partnership
in Dom-Mystique.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.895
I will buy out
your ownership stake.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.606
Wait, what?
How does that help anything?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.065
It helps me to know

24:44.107 --> 24:46.318
the owner will always put
the company first.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.612
You are completely
overreacting here.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.156
And I thought
we were in a good place.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.700
I guess that's, what,
only if I'm doing what you want?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.243
We are in a good place.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.995
This isn't personal.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.206
You have a conflict of interest.

24:59.247 --> 25:02.751
I need to focus on my company,
and you focus on yours.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.794
It's just business.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.381
Fine. I'll have my lawyer

25:08.423 --> 25:11.009
draw up the paperwork
to sell my stake.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.805
But partner or not,

25:15.847 --> 25:18.808
you still can't sell
your clothes anywhere but FSN.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.769
We'll see about that.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.066
(indistinct chatter)
(dance music playing)

25:32.822 --> 25:34.074
This is amazing!

25:34.115 --> 25:36.076
Carter just posted
a picture of us,

25:36.117 --> 25:38.161
and I already have
a ton of new followers.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.955
Maybe one of them is
your future agent.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.791
Oh, my God! You never know.
Fingers crossed.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.252
I think I'm
definitely drunk.
Yeah.

25:45.293 --> 25:48.129
I can tell by the way that
you're dancing, but I like it.

25:48.171 --> 25:51.091
This is exactly the kind
of fun I was talking about.

♪ ♪

25:53.134 --> 25:54.803
Hey!

25:54.844 --> 25:56.721
You canceled Jazz Night
to throw a party,

25:56.763 --> 25:58.014
and you didn't
even tell me?

25:58.056 --> 26:00.225
Crap. I meant to tell you.

26:00.267 --> 26:04.104
Which I realize now is not
the same as telling you. My bad.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.564
But this isn't
just a party.

26:05.605 --> 26:07.524
This is actually great
for the club, too.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.359
All of these people
have millions of followers,

26:09.401 --> 26:13.280
so I'm actually living
my best life for both of us.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.198
If living your best life
means screwing over

26:15.240 --> 26:17.367
your business partner and friend

26:17.409 --> 26:19.286
to hang out with a bunch of
people you barely even know,

26:19.327 --> 26:22.289
you may need to rethink
your priorities.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.040
No, I wasn't trying
to screw you over.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.585
I just got caught up
in the excitement. That's all.

26:26.626 --> 26:29.879
But you just don't understand.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.591
No. I don't.

At all.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.510
Wow.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.096
I've been looking for you.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.223
Why?

26:43.768 --> 26:44.894
Well,

26:44.936 --> 26:47.022
you found me.
Mmm.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.523
(phone chimes)

26:48.565 --> 26:50.734
Hey, actually,

26:50.775 --> 26:52.944
can you scooch
over a little

26:52.986 --> 26:54.946
and tilt your head
the other way?

26:54.988 --> 26:58.325
Huh?
The lighting's
better this angle.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.910
Let's try again?

27:00.952 --> 27:03.997
(exhales) You're trying
to put our first kiss

27:04.039 --> 27:06.625
on your story?
Well, technically,

27:06.666 --> 27:09.753
it's our second kiss. But...

27:11.087 --> 27:12.964
...this one will look better.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.674
Okay.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.437
There's the chess set.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.981
And Nana Carrington's
candelabra.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.358
It's all here.

27:31.399 --> 27:32.859
All right, relax, Velma.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.653
We don't know for sure
that Winston's stealing.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.155
Oh, really, Shaggy? Because
it seems pretty clear to me.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.032
What, the guy
compliments your six-pack,

27:39.074 --> 27:40.825
and now he can do no wrong?

27:40.867 --> 27:42.160
This isn't the first time
that Winston

27:42.202 --> 27:44.037
has taken something
that wasn't his.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.540
On second thought,
you're probably right about him.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.250
What are you doing?

27:49.292 --> 27:50.669
(shotgun racks)

27:50.710 --> 27:54.422
The question is,
what are you doing?

28:01.137 --> 28:02.555
I heard a noise.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.641
So you pulled a gun on us?

28:04.683 --> 28:06.518
It's an antique.
It doesn't even fire.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.686
Guns terrify me.

28:07.727 --> 28:08.895
I-I just... I carry it

28:08.937 --> 28:10.146
in case I need to scare anyone

28:10.188 --> 28:11.564
while I'm on my rounds.
Oh,

28:11.606 --> 28:13.066
that's rich coming
from the man who's stealing

28:13.108 --> 28:14.693
all my family's belongings.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.444
What are you talking about?
LIAM:
Well,

28:16.486 --> 28:18.029
you told us you cleared
out the staff quarters.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.072
Well...
FALLON:
Yeah.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.156
But now I see,

28:20.198 --> 28:21.324
the only thing cleared out

28:21.366 --> 28:22.909
is half my family's history.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.411
I have no idea
how all of this got here.

28:24.452 --> 28:25.870
I-I certainly wouldn't touch it.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.580
And neither should you.

28:27.622 --> 28:29.165
That candelabra
is very delicate.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.960
Yes, I know.
It was my grandmother's.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.211
I just don't want you
to break it, all right?

28:33.253 --> 28:34.963
Please. Please.
Get your hands

28:35.004 --> 28:36.673
off of me!

28:36.715 --> 28:38.216
(Fallon grunts)

28:38.258 --> 28:40.135
Did you just kick me?
You...

28:40.176 --> 28:41.720
Ow!

28:41.761 --> 28:42.929
(Fallon grunting)
LIAM: Calm down!

28:42.971 --> 28:44.389
Everyone, calm down!
(growls)

28:44.431 --> 28:48.643
(grunts) You second-rate
mall security guard!

28:48.685 --> 28:51.229
(grunts) I don't care what
you say to my face, you viper!

28:51.271 --> 28:53.565
Everyone, just calm
down! Je... Whoa!

28:53.606 --> 28:54.774
(grunts)
Let go of it!
(grunts)

28:54.816 --> 28:57.777
No! The only way
I am letting go

28:57.819 --> 29:00.572
is when I cram it
down your throat!
(grunting)

29:00.613 --> 29:01.906
Ow! Aah!

29:01.948 --> 29:03.616
Stop!
(panting)

29:05.326 --> 29:07.829
She's had anger issues
ever since she was a child.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.456
Divorce does that.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.999
LIAM:
Yeah, you're both
acting like children.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.417
We can handle this
like adults.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.711
I am an adult!
(gasps)

29:15.211 --> 29:18.298
Nana Carrington
would roll over in her grave

29:18.339 --> 29:19.632
if she knew
what you did today.

29:19.674 --> 29:22.218
To think you'd accuse me
of stealing.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.596
I quit.
FALLON:
Well, good.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.723
Because you're fired.

29:29.225 --> 29:33.021
Whew. This place
has always been so relaxing.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.481
(exhales)

29:35.648 --> 29:37.859
Yeah, I still don't trust you.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.695
I'm only doing this because I'm
worried about Cristal's health.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.655
Well, you should be.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.949
She hasn't been herself lately.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.619
Well, hopefully this
will make you feel less stressed

29:47.660 --> 29:49.245
and get back to
your old self.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.039
I'm sure I will.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.166
Let's just
get this over with.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.877
Blake?
Yeah.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.506
You'll just need
to sign here.

30:00.423 --> 30:02.008
(pen scribbles)

30:02.050 --> 30:05.178
You need to sign here.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.638
(clears throat)

30:14.270 --> 30:16.231
RITA:
What is it?

30:16.272 --> 30:17.899
Do you need your glasses?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.442
No.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.033
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.077
I know I agreed. I just...
I can't do it.

30:29.118 --> 30:32.497
This is a giant mistake,
and you'll regret it later.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.040
Blake, we've been over this.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.042
Our lives will be so much better

30:36.084 --> 30:38.127
without the Flores business
hanging over our heads.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.879
Come on. We had a deal!

30:39.921 --> 30:42.465
I just have a bad feeling
I can't shake.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.967
Sometimes you got to listen
to your gut.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.635
This is one of those times.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.555
Don't throw away my happiness
over a bad feeling.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.473
I'm not, honey.
I'm protecting it.

30:50.515 --> 30:54.018
Arthur,
please see Mr. Flores out.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.563
Tear up those contracts.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.860
BETO:
This isn't over.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.202
Thanks for agreeing to
have coffee with me.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.288
I thought you'd be hanging
with your crew.

31:13.329 --> 31:17.041
You know, taking pictures
of people partying.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.668
Taking pictures
of people kissing.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.463
Taking pictures
of people taking pictures.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.632
You saw his feed?
Yeah.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.551
I wanted to check out
what all the hype was about.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.928
Is this the life you want now?

31:28.970 --> 31:32.515
Actually? No. Not at all.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.892
I just...

31:33.933 --> 31:35.143
I got so wrapped up

31:35.184 --> 31:36.436
in trying to look
cool for Carter,

31:36.477 --> 31:38.688
I didn't notice how
sad his life is.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.815
All curated.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.400
(gasps)
Are you saying

31:42.442 --> 31:44.944
everything on the Internet
isn't what it seems?

31:44.986 --> 31:46.529
Ha ha.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.489
(laughs)
Look,

31:48.531 --> 31:50.700
I'm sorry I blew off Jazz Night
and didn't check with you.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.285
We're equal partners,

31:52.327 --> 31:53.828
and you didn't deserve
to be treated that way.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.663
No, I did not.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.457
But you didn't do it on purpose,

31:57.498 --> 31:59.500
so all is forgiven.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.753
I think you learned your lesson.

32:01.794 --> 32:03.671
Oh, uh, I did.

32:03.713 --> 32:06.799
My left side
is my better kissing side.

32:06.841 --> 32:08.593
Oh, my God.
(sighs)

32:08.635 --> 32:10.595
But, also,
when I'm kissing someone,

32:10.637 --> 32:13.181
I don't want to have to worry
about angles or light.

32:13.222 --> 32:17.268
You know,
Jazz Night could be fun.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.604
And I'm definitely
gonna check it out.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.105
I think a more
mature influence,

32:21.147 --> 32:24.776
not influencer, is what I need.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.361
Mm-hmm.

32:26.402 --> 32:27.862
And I actually met someone
who I connected with

32:27.904 --> 32:29.656
on a genuine level.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.574
And not even online.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.952
Cheers to that.
Look at you.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.954
(knock at door)

32:35.995 --> 32:37.497
Hello, Mother.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.541
You want 50%

32:40.583 --> 32:42.710
of all profits
in perpetuity?

32:42.752 --> 32:44.545
It's standard procedure

32:44.587 --> 32:46.506
to ensure
I'm getting fair compensation

32:46.547 --> 32:47.882
for my efforts in building

32:47.924 --> 32:49.509
the business.
Oh, which reminds me.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.011
Uh, I also want
an early investor fee.

32:52.053 --> 32:55.264
Is this a joke? No business
can sustain that kind of model.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.724
Depends on the type of business.

32:56.766 --> 32:59.394
Well, not this one.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.728
If you want

33:00.770 --> 33:02.063
to play hardball, you'd better
be ready

33:02.105 --> 33:03.314
for a fight, son.

33:03.356 --> 33:06.025
No problem, Mother.

33:06.067 --> 33:09.612
It's just business. Right?

33:17.870 --> 33:21.416
Oh, I am so tired. I need a nap.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.960
You kept me up all night,
tossing and turning.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.920
Well, I know. I had
way too much adrenaline

33:25.962 --> 33:29.298
coursing through my body. But I
think I've hit a low point now.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.592
It's kind of hard to focus
on love after all the drama.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.011
Yeah. Or not hard,

33:33.052 --> 33:35.054
as the case may be.
Whoa.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.723
(chuckles):
Don't pin this on me.
I know.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.392
I'm kidding.
Now, on a more serious note,

33:39.434 --> 33:41.352
take off your pants.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.688
What? Like, right here?

33:43.730 --> 33:45.732
No. All right, I guess I'll let
you wait until we get upstairs,

33:45.773 --> 33:47.066
but that's
all the waiting I'm doing.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.401
We have to make a baby,

33:48.443 --> 33:49.736
and time is running out.
(phone vibrating)

33:49.777 --> 33:52.363
Okay.
What? Why is Blake calling me?

33:52.405 --> 33:55.825
Okay, fine. I'll
meet you upstairs.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.785
Aye, aye, Captain.
Don't do that.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.287
You said you'd let me go

33:59.328 --> 34:00.621
once Blake
signed the company back to you.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.874
I will.
But Blake refused to sign.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.084
It's because he knows
something is off.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.544
How long

34:06.586 --> 34:07.962
do you think you can get away
with this?

34:08.004 --> 34:09.005
RITA:
Long enough to get

34:09.047 --> 34:10.548
what we want.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.969
But don't worry.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.679
I brought you a
change of clothes.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.974
Don't say I never did
anything for you.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.976
I've gotten to know Blake,

34:22.018 --> 34:24.312
and he'll never
stop protecting

34:24.353 --> 34:27.523
poor, weak Cristal.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.152
My husband loves me.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.945
He sure does, sugar.

34:32.987 --> 34:36.491
Which is why we'll just have
to remove him from the equation.

34:39.702 --> 34:42.288
This is the stuff
we talked about.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.956
Should do the trick.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.291
What is that?

34:45.333 --> 34:46.876
What are you gonna do to him?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.503
Probably best if you don't know.

34:49.378 --> 34:51.047
Don't want to upset you.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.764
(phone ringing)
You rang? Or are ringing?

34:59.806 --> 35:02.642
I just spoke
to a-a very upset Winston.

35:02.683 --> 35:05.937
Oh, upset that we learned
he's stealing all our stuff?

35:05.978 --> 35:07.063
Winston didn't steal anything.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.564
Don't fall for his act.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.233
This might be my fault.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.027
I told Bertie the housekeeper
to move

35:13.069 --> 35:15.113
the Carrington heirlooms
to the empty staff quarters,

35:15.154 --> 35:18.950
and it seems that I forgot
to tell Winston. Or you.

35:18.991 --> 35:20.993
"Might" have been your fault?

35:21.035 --> 35:23.371
You could have saved me
some bruised shins.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.790
Wait, wait, so this means
that nothing is missing?

35:25.832 --> 35:27.875
He's not selling
all of our stuff right now?

35:27.917 --> 35:30.169
No, everything is accounted for,
except the family crest,

35:30.211 --> 35:31.587
which I'm sure
is in a box somewhere.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.131
Oh, wow, okay. Well, then,

35:33.172 --> 35:35.133
I might owe Winston
a little apology.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.592
Yeah, I smoothed it over.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.886
He agreed to finish
the job for a bonus.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.805
And then he mentioned
how this was like the summer

35:40.847 --> 35:43.391
that you accused him of stealing
your Girl Scout Cookies.

35:43.432 --> 35:45.268
Oh, yes. Yes.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.019
It wasn't him that time, either.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.272
It was Alexis cheating
on whatever diet she was on

35:49.313 --> 35:51.274
with the Thin Mints. Right.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.609
I didn't realize that you would
be so concerned

35:53.651 --> 35:55.194
with the Carrington memorabilia.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.446
Considering you told me
to sell the compound.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.949
Well, I still think
that you should sell it.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.325
But I want to buy it.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.743
You do?

36:02.785 --> 36:04.912
The place meant more to me
than I realized.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.205
I'll tell Winston
to stay on, then.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.415
You're gonna want him around.

36:07.456 --> 36:08.791
I will?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.585
Okay. Fine.

36:10.626 --> 36:14.422
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have an appointment upstairs.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.055
JEFF:
Would you mind leaving any
more threats in writing?

36:23.097 --> 36:24.515
Because I'm kind of busy.

36:24.557 --> 36:27.059
You're talking to me
about threats?

36:27.101 --> 36:29.270
What about
your ridiculous demands?

36:29.312 --> 36:31.939
Unless you're trying
to extort your own mother,

36:31.981 --> 36:33.858
those obviously are not real.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.276
No, of course they are.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.069
I don't believe you.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.071
I just can't
figure out why

36:39.113 --> 36:41.157
you would waste everyone's time
with conditions

36:41.199 --> 36:44.744
you know I would never agree to.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.829
Honestly?

36:47.371 --> 36:50.708
Because I'm afraid of losing
the new connection we have.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.793
We just got
to this point.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.587
But if I'm not a partner
at Dom-Mystique,

36:54.629 --> 36:56.923
I won't see you as much.

36:56.964 --> 36:59.050
No reason for breakfasts.

37:00.676 --> 37:03.930
How about
because you're my son?

37:03.971 --> 37:06.974
Keep that weekly breakfast
on your calendar.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.477
I'm not giving that up.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.020
Work or no work.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.438
Now,

37:12.480 --> 37:14.690
are you ready to drop
your fake demands

37:14.732 --> 37:16.859
and sell me your half

37:16.901 --> 37:19.070
of Dom-Mystique at a fair price?

37:19.111 --> 37:20.571
Of course I am.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.281
(chuckles)
But also,

37:22.323 --> 37:24.533
I reviewed your Fallon Unlimited
contract,

37:24.575 --> 37:26.535
which stipulates you can't sell

37:26.577 --> 37:28.996
what you're selling on FSN
anywhere else.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.249
Yes, you've made that
quite clear, but thanks.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.251
However, it doesn't
say anything

37:33.292 --> 37:34.794
about what you're not selling.

37:34.835 --> 37:36.587
Am I supposed to be
following this?

37:36.629 --> 37:38.714
You can't sell
your women's wear online,

37:38.756 --> 37:41.342
but you can sell
your accessories line.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.219
Bags, purses, jewelry.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.512
Anywhere you want.

37:44.553 --> 37:47.556
But I don't have
an accessory line.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.059
Yet.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.854
(both laugh)

37:56.607 --> 37:58.359
So we're buying the compound?

37:58.401 --> 38:00.486
Yeah. I want to keep
it in the family.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.196
I have way too many
good memories there,

38:02.238 --> 38:03.948
and I want that for our kids.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.866
I want that for our kids, too.

38:05.908 --> 38:08.494
I was so focused on the future,
I completely ignored the past,

38:08.536 --> 38:09.954
but they're linked together.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.999
And speaking
of "linked together..."

38:14.500 --> 38:16.043
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow...

38:16.085 --> 38:17.295
What?

38:17.336 --> 38:18.629
I think I pulled a hamstring

38:18.671 --> 38:20.214
when I was fighting
with Winston.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.757
But I can push through the pain.
You shouldn't have

38:21.799 --> 38:23.676
to push through the pain
to have a baby with me.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.344
I mean, at least not
till the end of the pregnancy.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.888
We don't actually have
to make this all happen tonight.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.515
Why are you acting
like you're being

38:29.557 --> 38:31.517
shipped off to war
in the morning?

38:34.729 --> 38:36.314
Because I'm worried.

38:36.355 --> 38:39.317
I mean, you're gonna be
busy with your movie,

38:39.358 --> 38:40.943
I'm about to go back to work,

38:40.985 --> 38:42.862
and I'm not gonna be able
to focus on anything else.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.113
What if we miss our window?

38:44.155 --> 38:45.656
Well, then, we'll
have next month.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.116
And then we'll have
the month after that

38:47.158 --> 38:49.535
and then we'll have
all the time in between,

38:49.577 --> 38:52.163
even if you aren't
a fertile Pampa of Argentina.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.790
But what if you change
your mind?

38:54.832 --> 38:58.002
What? Is that really what
you're worried about?

38:58.044 --> 39:02.506
Hey... baby,
that's never gonna happen.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.885
I am in this with you,
a hundred percent.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.178
Thank you.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.512
I'm kind of touched

39:08.554 --> 39:11.349
by this rare moment
of vulnerability.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.893
Is it weird
that it's turning me on?

39:16.896 --> 39:18.689
No. No, I can't do it.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.107
I feel like
my hamstring is gonna pop.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.734
Oh, I give up.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.277
(sighs)

39:26.947 --> 39:28.657
(laughs)

39:33.788 --> 39:35.831
Sam, hi.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.625
Hi.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.585
I know this might seem
a little weird, but, uh,

39:39.627 --> 39:42.755
please don't stop me because
otherwise I might lose my nerve.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.841
I, uh, I feel
like we had a connection

39:45.883 --> 39:48.135
last night at the club,
but I almost missed it

39:48.177 --> 39:51.806
because I've been focusing
on the wrong things in life.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.224
Anyway, I, uh,

39:53.265 --> 39:54.642
I'm really sorry I blew you off

39:54.683 --> 39:56.727
for dinner last night.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.396
But I'm really happy
you asked me again

39:58.437 --> 40:01.315
because I would love
to go on a date with you.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.735
Oh, wow, uh...

40:04.777 --> 40:07.988
I'm sorry, but I-I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

40:08.030 --> 40:11.700
A misunderstanding? I...
(laughs softly)

40:11.742 --> 40:13.911
I thought you wanted
to have dinner with me.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.246
I do.

40:15.287 --> 40:19.166
But only because, well...

40:19.208 --> 40:20.251
because you're my son.
