Cranberry muffin, please,
and, uh, a vanilla latte.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.700
Oh, dear, comfort food.
What happened?

00:19.800 --> 00:25.000
Niles, do you think I'm elitist?

00:27.500 --> 00:30.500
Of course I do.
You needn't worry about that.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.800
No, not in the good way.
At work today,

00:34.000 --> 00:39.200
I discovered
an injurious graffito about me

00:39.700 --> 00:41.500
scrawled on the men's room wall.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.100
- No.
- Yes.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.400
Quote:

00:47.200 --> 00:50.000
<i>"There once was a man</i>
<i>Frasier Crane</i>

00:50.200 --> 00:52.700
<i>Who says he can feel your pain</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:56.700
<i>But he acts like a snob</i>
<i>To the guys at his job</i>

00:57.000 --> 00:59.500
<i>And I think he's totally lame"</i>

01:01.000 --> 01:05.600
That's terrible. There's a tense shift
and a proximate rhyme.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.600
The scansion
leaves a lot to be desired.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.400
No, no, no. You're missing the point.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.900
I have always striven
to be approachable.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.200
The embodiment of the words:

01:14.500 --> 01:17.400
<i>If you can talk with crowds</i>
<i>and keep your virtue</i>

01:17.600 --> 01:20.200
<i>Or walk with kings</i>...
<i>nor lose the common touch</i>

01:20.400 --> 01:24.300
Exactly. Thank you.
If my maligner truly knew who I was,

01:24.700 --> 01:29.000
then he would have found that a more
apt characterization than "snob."

01:29.400 --> 01:32.400
- Assuming he's familiar with Kipling.
- Heh. What are the odds?

01:39.500 --> 01:43.900
Well, Roz, I'd ask you join us,
but I see you already had happy hour.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.500
[FRASIER LAUGHS]

01:45.800 --> 01:49.200
Well, here, please join us. So...?

01:49.600 --> 01:52.000
- Well, um, his name is Roger.
FRASIER: Yeah.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.100
And, uh, we've been kind of going out
for the last couple of weeks.

01:55.300 --> 01:58.000
- All right, tell us about him.
- He's very sweet,

01:58.300 --> 02:01.400
and he's a garbage man.
So go ahead, make your jokes.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.100
What jokes? I mean,
why does everyone assume

02:04.300 --> 02:07.300
- I look down on the common man?
- Oh, I've got a good one. Uh...

02:09.500 --> 02:12.600
So even in his off time,
he's taking out the trash?

02:12.900 --> 02:13.800
[ROZ LAUGHS]

02:14.100 --> 02:16.300
Technically,
that's really more about Roz.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.700
If I were to make a joke about him,
which I wouldn't,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.300
I'd say he has a thing for Roz's can.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.800
- Oh, that's good, that's good.
- You two finished?

02:27.100 --> 02:29.000
- Okay, okay. So...
- Thank you.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.600
And don't worry, I won't get dumped.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.800
BOTH:
Oh.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.300
Yes.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.400
- I'd already passed on that.
- Yes, it was a bit on the nose.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.200
- On the nose. Yes, that's right.
- Uh-huh.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.000
- Dad, Daphne.
- Hey. Look what your father found.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
A picture of you
in a teddy-bear costume.

[DAPHNE LAUGHING]

02:56.000 --> 02:57.700
Why do you have all this out?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.700
Well, I was making room
in the storage closet

03:00.000 --> 03:02.400
- and I found some of your old stuff.
DAPHNE: Oh.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.900
- What else is in here?
- Well, here's your cap

03:05.100 --> 03:06.900
and your blazer
from Bryce Academy.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
NILES AND DAPHNE:
Oh.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.800
Oh, I bet you were
the cutest thing in that.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.400
- Oh, well, here's a picture of me in it.
- Oh.

03:15.700 --> 03:18.100
NILES:
Oh, oh, oh.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.000
Bobby Fischer's autograph.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.400
Well, son, it's been enough years.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.100
I can probably tell you the truth
about that.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.400
- What?
- Oh, look.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.600
A picture of you
in your first Little League uniform.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.500
I don't know why I said first.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.800
- Was that your game face?
- Oh, no, no.

03:43.200 --> 03:46.900
L... I'd just lost a tooth
due to an errant pitch.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.700
- Tell her who was pitching.
- I was.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.400
- Flowers from your new beau?
- Yeah.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.700
Must be nice to be liked.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.100
Are you still
obsessing over that limerick?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.500
People are making additions.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.700
Good lord, I have read anthologies
with fewer contributing authors.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.100
- I'm sure they'll all wash right off.
- If only there were a solvent

04:19.500 --> 04:23.100
that could remove the stains
they've left on my spirit.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.000
It was a joke. What's the big deal?

04:26.200 --> 04:30.800
Oh, yes, I know. Being written up on
a bathroom wall is no big deal to you.

04:33.100 --> 04:37.800
But that limerick made a point,
as all good limericks do.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.800
It seems to have resonated
with everyone around here.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.400
I want these people to know
the real Frasier Crane.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.800
Wouldn't it be better
if you tried to make them like you?

04:49.900 --> 04:54.500
Yes. And to that end I was thinking
along the lines of, oh,

04:54.800 --> 04:58.200
say, a little party
for the entire staff at my place.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.100
- Hey, you could bring Roger.
- Thanks,

05:01.300 --> 05:03.900
but I think it's too soon. I don't wanna
put any pressure on him.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.900
Come on, Roz, you always say
you don't have a date for these things.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.300
It's gonna be a lot of radio talk and I'm
not sure he's gonna be comfortable.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.100
Who is?

05:13.500 --> 05:15.600
Come on, Roz, I'd like to meet him.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.800
I don't know. Maybe next party.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.200
Does this have anything to do
with his occupation?

05:20.500 --> 05:23.600
You know,
his being a refuse collector?

05:23.800 --> 05:27.200
No, I am completely
comfortable with his job.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.900
I just don't want him to feel awkward
around other people.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.600
- Not that he should, or would.
- Yes, all right, fine.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.100
Fine. If you change your mind,

05:34.400 --> 05:37.100
he's more than welcome, all right?
It promises to be a real wingding.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.600
If being a snob is the reputation
I've built around here,

05:39.900 --> 05:43.000
then this party will be the wrecking ball
of congeniality that tears it down.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.300
[CHUCKLES]

05:44.900 --> 05:47.300
- Yeah, say stuff like that.
- Yeah.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.000
- Say, "Come on, Mom."
- Come on, Mom.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.200
- Say, "Don't be a wuss."
- Don't be a wuss.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.000
I'm not a wuss.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.600
Oh, I know you were
gonna make dinner,

06:01.800 --> 06:03.600
but why not just
open a can of something?

06:03.900 --> 06:05.800
How'd you think
I was gonna make dinner?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.100
Alice, go pick out some p.j.'s.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.700
Hey, when you're done,
I got a special book for you.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.800
It's called <i>Make Room for Monkeys</i>.
Now, hurry up, get out of here. Go on.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.400
Oh.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.800
<i>Make Room for Monkey</i> s?

06:20.100 --> 06:22.200
Where did you find this?
You know, it's out of print.

06:22.500 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, well, a certain
very bad skater that I know

06:26.200 --> 06:28.800
told me it was her favourite book
when she was growing up,

06:29.100 --> 06:32.000
so I kept my eyes open
and I found it in a pile of old books.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.000
You mean, like at the dump?

06:38.300 --> 06:41.600
No, not a dump. Please.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.900
It's a secret underground landfill
accessible only to garbage men.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.200
And the Mole People who live there.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.100
I used to be one of them,
but, ah, then I decided

06:52.400 --> 06:55.400
to join the surface dwellers
and find my queen.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.100
[ROZ GIGGLES]

06:58.400 --> 07:00.600
Thank you. That's very thoughtful.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.700
And you will make an excellent Mole.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.100
Of course, after a year underground,
your eyes will fuse shut.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.000
- Your sense of smell will...
- Okay, stop, stop.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.200
Do you joke around
about your career

07:16.400 --> 07:18.600
because you're uncomfortable
talking about it?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.600
You mean
deeply and utterly ashamed?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.500
Uh, whatever. Your words.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.600
I don't know. I never really
thought about it as a career.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.600
I mean, it's just a job to me.

07:30.900 --> 07:34.000
You know, it's got great benefits
and afternoons off,

07:34.200 --> 07:40.300
and whenever I have a family,
I'll get to spend a lot of time with them.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.700
How sweet will that be?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.400
Would you like to go to a party
with me on Saturday?

07:49.600 --> 07:53.600
I'd love to. I found
a great pair of shoes this morning.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.600
They damn near match.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.500
FRASIER: Good to see you. Glad you
could come. Make yourselves at home.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.800
Why don't you introduce me
to some of your friends?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.100
I wish I could, Dad.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.700
I don't know
any of these people myself.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.100
You don't?
I better go hide my beer in the crisper.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
Hey, Frasier,
thanks for inviting me to your party.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.500
Well, it's my pleasure, man.

- Actually, I did not.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.600
Oh, man, it was a real squeaker.
UDub pulled it out at the end

08:29.800 --> 08:32.700
with a last-second field goal.
It's all about special teams. Am I right?

Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. Yeah...

08:35.000 --> 08:38.200

the term "challenged."

- Roz, Roz, come on in. Hey.
- Hi.

for just one minute?

- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks so much.

Roz, Roz, please don't leave me
alone here.

I don't know any
of these people's names.

Frasier, I cannot desert Roger
in a room full of nosy strangers.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.600
Well, look, look. He's already met Dad.
He knows as many people as I do.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.200
Sorry, you're gonna have
to find yourself another patsy.

to find another...? Kenny.

Hey, Roz. Looking sweet.

09:31.900 --> 09:32.900
Hey, Noel.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
So that's the competition. Hmm.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.300
Or are you just using him
to get me jealous?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
Actually, I forgot
you were gonna be here.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.900
I'll bet you regret
bringing the arm candy now, huh?

09:45.700 --> 09:47.800
So, uh, what's he do?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
He works for the city.

09:50.700 --> 09:51.600
Oh.

09:51.800 --> 09:56.200
So, in a manner of speaking, I pay
his salary, which makes me his boss.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.400
Does that turn you on?

10:02.800 --> 10:04.400
Roger, would you like
something to drink?

- Introduce me to your friend.

in your neighbourhood.

me massages, and he's just great.

what I do?

- No!

Well, you're not the first rustler who's
tried to cut my little filly from the herd.

So did you guys, uh,
happen to see the game today?

11:14.600 --> 11:17.800
- No, I missed that. Who won?
- Well, actually, it was a real squeaker.

11:18.100 --> 11:23.100
Uh, UDub pulled it out at the last
second with a real clutch field goal.

Say, Dad, what's going on?

11:26.400 --> 11:28.200
I don't know.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.700
Yeah, the station manager's
sort of the head honcho.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.900
You know, the go-to guy.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.300
You could replace virtually everybody
else at the station except for me.

- And Roz. So, what do you do?
- I'm a...

please get me a sandwich?

not in the biz, huh?

11:50.900 --> 11:52.700
- Heh, heh.
- So, what's he do?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.900
What difference
does it make, Kenny?

11:55.100 --> 11:57.900
Why are people so obsessed
with what people do?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.500
Every party you go to,

11:59.600 --> 12:02.600
all anyone ever asks you is,
"What do you do? What do you do?"

12:03.000 --> 12:05.400
You know, not everyone has a job
they're proud of.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.900
Did you ever think of that?

12:07.100 --> 12:11.300
Why can't you ask him about music,
or sports, or books, for God's sake?

12:11.700 --> 12:14.200
"Have you read a good book lately?"
Why don't you ask him that,

12:14.400 --> 12:17.000
instead of embarrassing everybody?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.900
Here's your sandwich, Roz.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.700
So have you read
any good books lately?

12:25.800 --> 12:29.600
No, actually, us garbage men
don't have a lot of time to read books.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.800
And we have to get up pretty early
in the morning

12:32.100 --> 12:34.200
so I guess I better get out of here.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.500
Bye, Roz.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.600
[SIGHS]

12:36.900 --> 12:38.300
- Hey, Frasier, thanks a lot.
- Right.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.000
It was really nice meeting everyone.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.300
Goodbye.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.700
[WHISPERS]
Roger.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.900
I know that.

12:54.300 --> 12:57.600
DENNIS: Hey, Crane man.
FRASIER: Oh, Dennis, Lisa, hi.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.800
Patty. Oh, looking good.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.000
[LAUGHING]

13:04.300 --> 13:05.900
Kill me.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.500
What are you talking about?
You're Mr. Popularity.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.500
Yes. And it's a living hell.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.800
I have spent the entire morning
exchanging fake pleasantries

13:16.100 --> 13:20.100
with a bunch of people that I have
absolutely nothing in common with.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.300
I miss being unapproachable.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.700
I thought you wanted to be loved
by the common man.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.200
Yes, but couldn't they have sent
just one representative?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.600
Ugh.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.200
[SIGHS]

13:41.700 --> 13:43.300
Roz?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.400
I'm sorry.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.600
Ever since Roger and I broke up,
I can't look at trash the same way.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.700
- You want to talk about it?
- No, it's okay.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.700
It's just so weird.

14:02.600 --> 14:07.300
You go through life meeting people
who are all the same, you know?

14:07.600 --> 14:10.300
And they just think
you're the same too.

14:10.700 --> 14:14.300
And then one day you meet this guy.

14:14.800 --> 14:19.900
But he's not the same because he
actually sees that you're not the same.

14:20.400 --> 14:24.600
And he knows
because he's the same way.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.800
Tsk.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.500
Roz, sounds to me like you're in love.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.300
[SOBBING]

14:32.600 --> 14:33.900
I can't be.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.500
I know that this is shallow,
and I hate myself for it,

14:36.800 --> 14:39.100
but I can't be in love
with a garbage man.

14:40.700 --> 14:44.900
Well, then you need to move on

14:45.200 --> 14:48.100
and realise that you've learned
something about yourself.

14:48.900 --> 14:52.100
Great. I've learned that I'm a snob.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.400
No, no,
just that you have certain standards

14:56.800 --> 15:00.000
that it may be difficult
for others to live up to.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.600
You know, Roz, seems you and I
are more alike than we thought.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.900
Okay, now I'm really miserable.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.100
- Look at me, I'm a mess.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.900
We got a few minutes before the
show starts. Go clean yourself up.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.600
JASON: Hey, hey, hey.
NOEL: Dr. Crane.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.600
DENNIS: Crane man.
JASON: What's going on?

15:20.900 --> 15:24.600
Well, my show, in about two minutes.
Uh, what can I do for you, gentlemen?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.300
Sue invited all of us to her place

15:26.600 --> 15:28.600
to watch the fight tonight
on pay-per-view.

15:28.900 --> 15:33.600
Right. Uh, well, as tempting as that
sounds, I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

15:33.900 --> 15:38.800
- Okay, we'll catch you next time.
- Well, actually, you won't.

15:40.100 --> 15:45.400
Jason, Noel, you there, uh...

15:47.900 --> 15:49.300
Uh...

15:49.600 --> 15:51.600
I've been living a lie.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.600
Let me tell you a little something
about things I don't like.

15:55.900 --> 15:59.500
Boxing, for one.
Sporting events of any kind. Uh...

16:00.400 --> 16:03.500
Barbecues, office parties,
buddy movies.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.700
Any dish made with marshmallows.

16:08.300 --> 16:14.000
Uh, things that I do like:
The opera, the symphony,

16:14.400 --> 16:17.100
Elizabethan revenge dramas,
et cetera.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
So if you're not inclined
toward any of these interests,

16:22.400 --> 16:24.000
well, then, frankly,

16:24.300 --> 16:30.400
our association can be civil at best.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.400
- Are we all clear on this concept?
- I told you.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.100
[MUTTERING]

16:40.700 --> 16:42.500
FRASIER:
Have a good day.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.000
[CHUCKLES]

16:45.900 --> 16:46.800
Hmm.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.700
Hey, what's going on?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.200
I found another box of pictures

16:54.400 --> 16:56.500
- from your childhood.
- Oh, no.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.100
- Oh, look at this one. You're adorable.
- Yes, it's all adorable.

17:00.500 --> 17:04.400
My retainer, and the membership card
to the Young Magicians Club,

17:06.300 --> 17:09.500
and that picture of me
in my choo-choo jammies.

17:09.900 --> 17:12.099
With your caboose hanging out.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.500
- Adorable.
- What...?

17:15.599 --> 17:18.200
Can we just give my childhood
a rest for a while?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.900
How would you feel if I took your most
humiliating moments

17:21.200 --> 17:22.200
and put them on display?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.800
You know, I think I've got
the perfect picture frame for this one.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.300
So she puts a few pictures out.
What's the big deal?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.700
There's a whole part of your life
she missed out on.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.200
Oh, I guess.

17:33.500 --> 17:37.200
Besides, I like seeing your old stuff.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.800
Oh, no one around here
draws pictures anymore.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.000
What the hell is this supposed to be,
anyway?

17:46.800 --> 17:51.100
Oh, that is an Egyptian
battle scene from <i>Aida</i>.

17:52.700 --> 17:56.000
Look, that's Radames,
and that's the jealous Amneris and...

17:56.300 --> 17:58.500
Look, I misspelled Amonasro.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.900
Oh, to be 6 again.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.900
- What is that?
- Some things from my childhood.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.300
You asked how I'd feel if the shoe
was on the other foot.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.500
- Go ahead, take a look.
- Oh. Okay

18:15.800 --> 18:17.300
Hmm.

18:18.100 --> 18:23.200
Oh, well, that's a wonderful drawing
of a, uh, turtle.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.600
No, that's my dad
crawling home from the pub.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.800
- Well, why did you sign it Dappy?
- Oh, my mom did that.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.800
My family called me Dappy
because I couldn't say Daphne.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.300
- Really?
- Yeah, I hated it.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.800
My brothers would sing,
"Dappy, Dappy, wet her nappy".

18:40.300 --> 18:43.000
Well, I think it's precious, Dappy.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.300
I'm going to call you that
from now on, Dappy.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.000
- No, you won't.
- Well, how about I call you Dappy

18:49.200 --> 18:51.900
until you put mementos back in the
box? How does that sound, Dappy?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.900
- That's not fair.
- Oh, Dad.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.700
You'll never guess what silly nickname
Daphne was called as a child.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.300
Is it worse than Piles?

fond memories.

[TRUCK ENGINE REWING]

19:21.500 --> 19:25.000
Roger's here.
Could I just go see him?

19:25.600 --> 19:28.100
- I don't think so, sweetie.
- Why?

19:28.400 --> 19:33.000
- Well, it's hard to explain.
- Why?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.400
[SIGHS]

19:34.700 --> 19:38.000
- It's complicated.
- Why?

19:42.200 --> 19:47.800
Mommy works in an office
and Roger works in a truck.

19:48.100 --> 19:54.000
And people in offices and
people in trucks... It's complicated.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.700
- But I like Roger.
- I know, honey.

19:58.100 --> 20:02.500
- Do you like Roger?
- Yes, but...

20:04.700 --> 20:07.000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.200
Okay.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.000
Sarah, can you look after Alice?

20:14.700 --> 20:16.900
I'll be right back.

Roger.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.300
Hi.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.900
I'm so sorry
that I've been such an idiot.

I don't... I don't know
what's been wrong with me.

All I know
is that I miss you like crazy.

for a Mole queen?
