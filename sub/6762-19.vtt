01:34.184 --> 01:37.138
Keep the pressure on, gentlemen.
Brandon, let's see some teamwork.

01:37.312 --> 01:40.562
Dylan, kick that puck out.
Come on, Dylan, dive for it.

01:40.774 --> 01:43.525
- Keep your head up, buddy.
- All right, man, you're gonna die.

01:43.736 --> 01:45.693
- You gotta catch me first.
- Oh, yeah?

01:45.863 --> 01:49.314
Get back to the game. Let's go, now.
Come on, keep the pressure on.

01:49.492 --> 01:53.655
Watch that stick. Keep the stick down.
Try for it. Pass, now. Pass, Brandon.

01:53.871 --> 01:57.204
Go for it. Come on, now.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.374
Steve, cut the angle off.

01:59.544 --> 02:01.002
Come on, Dylan, play the puck.

02:01.213 --> 02:03.704
Play the puck, Dylan.
Speed, speed. Good speed.

02:03.882 --> 02:06.005
Hey, Steve, how's the support, man?

02:22.069 --> 02:23.942
Good job, man, way to go.

02:24.112 --> 02:26.982
All right, men, that's it.

02:27.157 --> 02:28.651
Come on, guys, clear the ice.

02:28.868 --> 02:31.156
Good practise. Good practise.
All right.

02:31.329 --> 02:32.360
Nice shot, hot dog.

02:32.538 --> 02:34.032
Thanks, coach.
Thanks for the workout.

02:34.207 --> 02:35.998
Thought you said
your friend could skate.

02:38.962 --> 02:42.545
Well, maybe if we just propped him up
in the net, he could block a few shots.

02:42.716 --> 02:44.044
- Help him.
- Yeah.

02:46.011 --> 02:48.169
- Hey, Dylan.
- Yo, man.

02:48.347 --> 02:49.924
So, what, do you love it or what?

02:50.099 --> 02:52.424
Well, l tell you what.
This is not exactly the ocean,

02:52.601 --> 02:54.392
but, you know,
maybe l could get used to it.

02:54.562 --> 02:56.353
Told you.

02:58.399 --> 03:01.150
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

03:03.280 --> 03:06.234
- This is nothing like roller-skating.
- Who said it was?

03:06.408 --> 03:07.439
Wayne Gretzky.

03:07.618 --> 03:10.322
That's not
what the Great One told me.

03:10.496 --> 03:13.034
Come on, pal. Let's skate now.
Free and easy, okay? Come on.

03:13.207 --> 03:14.915
You can do it.

03:32.686 --> 03:34.228
Who's that?

03:34.396 --> 03:37.562
The resident prima donna.
Every rink has one.

03:41.529 --> 03:42.560
God.

03:42.739 --> 03:44.648
- You okay?
- God.

03:44.824 --> 03:45.855
You okay, man?

03:46.076 --> 03:48.282
l'm sorry. Are you okay?

03:48.495 --> 03:50.736
- l think l broke something.
- Yeah, he's fine.

03:50.956 --> 03:53.743
Oh, but you're cut.
l'm so sorry. lt was my fault.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.619
Don't worry.
You can run into us anytime.

03:55.794 --> 03:59.293
No, no, no. Don't let her off that easy.
lt's a basic rule of etiquette.

03:59.465 --> 04:02.300
When the buzzer sounds, the real
skaters are allowed to leave the ice

04:02.510 --> 04:04.253
before the charge
of the ice brigade begins.

04:04.429 --> 04:06.421
Oh, l see.
We're talking about real skaters,

04:06.598 --> 04:08.222
as opposed to what, ice bunnies?

04:08.558 --> 04:10.052
Hey, if the blade fits.

04:10.268 --> 04:11.976
Spoken like a true stickman.

04:12.646 --> 04:14.971
You know, medical studies show
that a four-minute routine

04:15.190 --> 04:18.190
requires more stamina
than a full period of hockey.

04:18.402 --> 04:20.310
Oh, l see.
So doing little spins and cartwheels,

04:20.488 --> 04:21.863
that makes you a real athlete?

04:22.072 --> 04:24.445
And can you prove this?

04:24.951 --> 04:27.868
Six laps around the rink.
You against me.

04:28.914 --> 04:30.076
You're kidding, right?

04:34.086 --> 04:35.496
Guess not.

04:50.478 --> 04:51.972
- Last lap.
- Go for it.

05:12.210 --> 05:14.001
A tie.

05:18.258 --> 05:20.416
Oh, man,
l was seriously dying on that last lap.

05:20.594 --> 05:22.717
l know you were.

05:24.015 --> 05:26.138
- You let me tie you, didn't you?
- No way.

05:26.309 --> 05:30.176
- l'm much too competitive for that.
- What's going on here?

05:31.898 --> 05:33.641
ls that what you do
with world-class skaters

05:33.817 --> 05:34.979
when l'm not here to babysit?

05:35.694 --> 05:38.185
Are you asking to get hurt?
ls that what you want, Trisha?

05:38.405 --> 05:39.733
No, Mr. Kluklinski.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.236
Look at the condition of the ice.
Where's the Zamboni?

05:42.451 --> 05:44.242
Who's responsible for this mess?

05:44.453 --> 05:46.991
l'm sorry.
lt was just a bit of friendly competition.

05:47.164 --> 05:50.284
Unfortunately,
we don't have time for friendly.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.163
- He's wound a little tight, isn't he?
- We all are.

05:54.339 --> 05:56.877
The U.S. finals are coming up.

05:57.551 --> 06:00.042
Finals? What is this, the big time?

06:00.721 --> 06:02.131
We've had a change in the schedule.

06:02.306 --> 06:04.713
After practise, it goes conditioning,
dance class,

06:04.892 --> 06:06.434
and then we'll look at the videos.

06:06.602 --> 06:10.101
- Okay.
- Whoa, hey, wait a second.

06:10.273 --> 06:15.065
- So when do l get my rematch?
- l'm on the ice by 5:30 a.m.

06:15.236 --> 06:18.605
Well, listen, if l'm not here, you can
just go ahead and start without me.

06:28.167 --> 06:31.999
Apricot Temptation.
Perfect. That's the one.

06:32.171 --> 06:34.294
l don't look too much like Madonna?

06:34.465 --> 06:37.335
Oh, l don't know. lt depends
on what Madonna looks like this week.

06:38.386 --> 06:40.177
So which one do you wanna order?

06:42.683 --> 06:44.343
Well, let me sleep on it, okay?

06:45.644 --> 06:48.810
Actually, l think that you should get
the Raspberry Cream too.

06:49.023 --> 06:52.107
- You don't think it's too bright?
- No, it's kind of neutral.

06:52.276 --> 06:54.185
Well, sort of.

06:54.362 --> 06:56.935
Hey, guys.
How was the first practise?

06:57.115 --> 07:00.069
lt's been a long time since l showed
anybody how to do a body check,

07:00.243 --> 07:02.781
but l gotta tell you, it was great.

07:03.538 --> 07:05.447
So, what do you think?

07:05.666 --> 07:08.335
Well, if anyone can whip us
into a team, it's Dad.

07:08.544 --> 07:09.658
l meant me.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.610
So this is the glamorous life
of an ice queen, huh?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.450
l can't believe you made it.

07:40.995 --> 07:44.031
Yeah, neither can my body.

07:44.916 --> 07:46.030
You do this every morning?

07:46.960 --> 07:51.004
Oh, yeah.
This is by far the best part of the day.

07:51.173 --> 07:55.336
lt's the only time l get to be myself,
feel like it's my life, you know?

07:55.511 --> 07:57.005
Was that your nice way of telling me

07:57.180 --> 07:58.971
that l broke my alarm clock
for nothing?

07:59.307 --> 08:02.592
Oh, no. No, l'm thrilled you're here.

08:02.769 --> 08:05.473
l can't think of anyone
l'd rather share my free time with.

08:05.689 --> 08:07.847
Well, thank you.
Then you won't hear a peep out of me.

08:08.025 --> 08:09.400
l'm not awake yet.

08:13.697 --> 08:15.689
Hey, what's the matter?

08:16.367 --> 08:19.036
Sometimes the pressure
can get to you, that's all.

08:19.245 --> 08:21.700
Well, l think l know
just what you need.

08:21.873 --> 08:24.280
A triple axel?

08:24.501 --> 08:26.908
Just a little skating humour,
that's all.

08:28.380 --> 08:33.457
No, l was thinking more along the lines
of a date with a hockey player.

08:35.095 --> 08:36.921
l'd like to, but l--

08:37.139 --> 08:39.546
No, no, it's okay. l understand.

08:39.725 --> 08:41.597
No, you don't understand.

08:42.477 --> 08:45.016
l really would like to go out with you,

08:45.190 --> 08:48.107
but l don't think Mr. Kluklinski
would go for it.

08:49.194 --> 08:50.688
We could always ask him.

08:52.322 --> 08:54.445
lt doesn't work that way.

08:56.785 --> 08:58.742
But can you stay
and watch the practise?

08:59.163 --> 09:02.828
- lf you want.
- Hey, l'm all yours.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.619
Come on.

09:04.794 --> 09:09.255
Concentrate. You're leaning in the air.
Don't arch your back to begin.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.724
That was nice. Much better.

09:22.939 --> 09:24.931
Okay, let's go back
to compulsories for a while.

09:25.108 --> 09:27.943
- You Joey?
- No, l'm Brandon Walsh.

09:28.111 --> 09:30.483
Oh, so you're not here
delivering a vending machine?

09:31.197 --> 09:34.945
- Sorry, l'm just a friend of Trisha's.
- Oh, my little cutie-pie.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.995
- Ain't she special?
- Yeah, she sure is.

09:38.205 --> 09:40.328
She's got the fire and the ice.

09:40.541 --> 09:44.455
Little girls like that come along once,
maybe twice a generation.

09:44.629 --> 09:46.705
- She works hard, huh?
- Yeah.

09:46.881 --> 09:49.550
Hey, does Coach K know
you're up here?

09:51.219 --> 09:53.507
- l think so. Why?
- Because he usually throws a fit

09:53.680 --> 09:56.800
if anyone tries to watch
Trisha's workouts.

09:56.975 --> 10:01.684
Well, l think l'll just stay here
until Trisha asks me to leave.

10:01.856 --> 10:03.101
Good for you, kid.

10:03.315 --> 10:05.023
Hold your ground, see?

10:05.192 --> 10:08.892
All those people down there
waiting to grab a piece of Team Trisha.

10:09.072 --> 10:11.278
You know what l'm saying?

10:11.491 --> 10:13.199
Yeah, l think l do.

10:23.003 --> 10:25.957
- Morning.
- Well, you are up early for a Saturday.

10:26.132 --> 10:28.255
And Brandon's already gone.
l mean, what's going on?

10:28.426 --> 10:29.588
Well, Brandon's on a mission,

10:29.761 --> 10:32.299
and l'm having a power breakfast
with Diedre.

10:32.472 --> 10:34.132
- Our sales manager.
- Oh, right.

10:34.307 --> 10:35.884
She is so great.

10:36.101 --> 10:38.010
She's teaching me
everything about the business,

10:38.186 --> 10:39.894
and she thinks
l could be a star someday.

10:40.105 --> 10:43.688
Well, l'm not surprised.
After all, sales is in your blood.

10:43.901 --> 10:45.229
- Mother.
- Now, don't snicker.

10:45.402 --> 10:46.896
You know, your grandfather
once owned

10:47.071 --> 10:49.028
the largest furniture store
in St. Paul.

10:49.198 --> 10:51.024
And l remember,
he used to tell the employees:

10:51.200 --> 10:52.362
''When it comes to sales,

10:52.535 --> 10:55.701
service with a smile
equals customer satisfaction.''

10:56.623 --> 10:59.577
Speaking of sales, have you decided
which kind of makeup you wanna buy?

11:00.794 --> 11:04.578
Yeah, sure.
lt's okay if l write you a cheque?

11:06.717 --> 11:08.341
Twenty dollars?

11:08.511 --> 11:11.346
You could only get your mother
to buy $20 worth of cosmetics?

11:11.514 --> 11:14.087
- You don't know my mother.
- Oh, l bet l do.

11:14.267 --> 11:16.508
l bet she's a Midwestern
traditionalist.

11:16.686 --> 11:19.806
Strong family values,
not much makeup, not much jewellery.

11:19.981 --> 11:22.685
Probably clips coupons. Am l close?

11:24.153 --> 11:26.940
Now, why are you looking at me
like that?

11:27.114 --> 11:28.857
The only reason
my mother bought anything

11:29.033 --> 11:31.606
was because she knew
l'm saving up to buy a car.

11:31.953 --> 11:34.954
Brenda, Brenda, Brenda.
You're not listening to me.

11:35.123 --> 11:36.783
What did l tell you yesterday?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.123
''We're not selling shoes,
we're selling self-image.''

11:39.294 --> 11:42.710
Exactly. And you have got to think
like a shrink, baby.

11:42.881 --> 11:46.464
You got about three seconds to size up
every customer that walks in that door.

11:46.677 --> 11:47.957
You have got to ask yourself:

11:48.137 --> 11:50.295
How do l sell this one?
What makes them tick?

11:50.514 --> 11:51.712
Do l appeal to their ego?

11:51.891 --> 11:53.930
Do l bully them,
do l go to bed with them?

11:55.770 --> 11:58.011
l'm kidding.

11:58.940 --> 12:00.766
There's so much to learn.

12:00.942 --> 12:02.815
Brenda, this is not something
that you learn.

12:03.028 --> 12:04.688
Either you have the instinct
or you don't.

12:04.863 --> 12:06.689
And you think l've got it?

12:06.865 --> 12:10.565
l didn't hire you to fill in at Christmas
out of the goodness of my heart.

12:18.878 --> 12:21.119
Far cry from ice hockey, huh?

12:21.297 --> 12:23.704
Yeah, there's a lot more to this sport
than l ever realized.

12:23.884 --> 12:26.007
- That's the truth.
- That last jump was fabulous.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.847
No. Her leg was slightly bent.

12:29.598 --> 12:31.637
She would have been
marked down for it.

12:31.809 --> 12:35.676
ln fact, this has been Trisha's
worst practise in a long time.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.428
And you being here is not helping.

12:40.652 --> 12:43.024
So is this your way
of asking me to leave?

12:43.196 --> 12:46.362
Don't take it the wrong way.
This is not a personal slight on you.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.359
Trisha's very vulnerable right now.

12:48.910 --> 12:50.570
Yeah, she could be
a world-class athlete,

12:50.746 --> 12:54.744
but in many ways,
she's still a very naive little girl

12:54.917 --> 12:59.911
who needs to put all her focus
on the skating, without distractions.

13:01.132 --> 13:04.086
You know, coach,

13:04.260 --> 13:07.095
it'd be real easy for me to walk out
of here now and never come back.

13:07.472 --> 13:10.556
And l know that that would make you
really happy.

13:10.767 --> 13:14.100
But Trisha invited me here, not you.

13:14.772 --> 13:17.892
And l may be overstepping
my bounds a little bit,

13:18.067 --> 13:19.561
but l was wondering
if maybe it's time

13:19.735 --> 13:21.893
somebody asked Trisha
what she wants.

13:39.006 --> 13:43.467
lsn't this perfect
with that plaid skirt? Great.

13:43.636 --> 13:44.667
Kind of like this one.

13:44.846 --> 13:48.179
l thought you would.
Actually, it's one of our bestsellers.

13:48.350 --> 13:50.638
Well, it's not bad
if you wanna smell like a luau.

13:53.647 --> 13:55.224
Look, you've been here
for over an hour.

13:55.399 --> 13:58.103
There's gotta be
something here you like.

13:58.277 --> 14:00.150
How about this one?

14:00.571 --> 14:02.812
- Well, that's not bad.
- Okay, l'll take it.

14:03.032 --> 14:05.653
- Great. Cash or charge?
- Wait. How much is it?

14:06.661 --> 14:08.238
Well, it's sort of expensive.

14:09.372 --> 14:11.163
A hundred and ninety dollars?

14:11.374 --> 14:12.832
You're buying self-image.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.221
- Bren, what are you doing here?
- l live here.

14:30.395 --> 14:32.471
Yeah, so do l.
l would have been here an hour ago

14:32.647 --> 14:35.220
if l hadn't driven across town
to pick you up.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.528
Brandon, l'm sorry.
l walked home. l totally spaced.

14:40.197 --> 14:43.400
- Three scoops?
- Second bowl.

14:43.576 --> 14:45.864
Tough day at the office, huh?

14:46.412 --> 14:48.985
l was on my feet
eight hours straight,

14:49.165 --> 14:53.494
and l probably made a total of,
let's see, 1 .95 in commissions.

14:53.712 --> 14:55.170
Yeah, l've been there.

14:55.380 --> 14:57.918
Everyone l approached was,
''Sorry, dear, just browsing.''

14:58.091 --> 15:00.546
l couldn't even convince Donna
to buy a lousy key chain,

15:00.719 --> 15:03.554
and meanwhile, Diedre was having
a field day at the register.

15:03.722 --> 15:06.094
The way she can read people
is phenomenal.

15:06.267 --> 15:07.298
l don't know, Bren.

15:07.476 --> 15:10.477
Mom's always saying that since
Grandpa was a natural-born salesman...

15:10.688 --> 15:12.348
Don't get me started.

15:12.732 --> 15:14.523
You two have a major blowout?

15:14.859 --> 15:18.109
No. They were gone
by the time l got home.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.863
l mean, it's not her fault,
and it's not Dad's fault.

15:22.034 --> 15:24.322
l'm sure they did the best they could.

15:24.495 --> 15:25.526
What are you saying?

15:25.746 --> 15:29.494
l'm saying l don't think they taught us
how to succeed in the real world.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.621
l think they blew it
when they raised us to be so...

15:32.795 --> 15:34.123
Nice.

15:34.297 --> 15:36.005
Yeah.

15:36.174 --> 15:39.340
- l know exactly what you're saying.
- You do?

15:39.553 --> 15:41.379
Oh, yeah.
l was thinking the same thing

15:41.555 --> 15:43.298
when l was watching Trisha
on the ice today.

15:43.474 --> 15:46.475
- Oh, how was it?
- She was great.

15:46.644 --> 15:49.479
But seeing how determined she was
got me to thinking back when l was 5

15:49.647 --> 15:51.141
and everyone was telling
Mom and Dad

15:51.315 --> 15:52.809
what a wonder whiz l was on skates.

15:53.443 --> 15:56.479
Yeah, you were.
lt used to drive me crazy.

15:56.654 --> 16:00.153
So, what if they had given me
a little push, huh?

16:00.367 --> 16:02.075
A little formal training? Who knows?

16:02.244 --> 16:05.992
Maybe l'd be a speed-skating
champion going for the gold.

16:06.623 --> 16:09.577
- You never know.
- Absolutely.

16:15.550 --> 16:17.376
You know, Brenda,
if we put our mind to it,

16:17.552 --> 16:19.591
we could make up for lost time.

16:19.763 --> 16:22.088
We just gotta get
our priorities straight.

16:22.265 --> 16:25.135
lt's a competitive world.
You need a competitive edge.

16:25.310 --> 16:27.386
And killer instinct.

16:28.063 --> 16:31.229
And about another gallon
of this Almond Crunch ice cream.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.476
Go for it, bro.

16:38.283 --> 16:40.774
No, lift. Lift.

16:41.161 --> 16:45.704
One, two, good.

16:45.874 --> 16:49.124
Yes. Now, back around. Very nice.

16:49.336 --> 16:50.616
Think of height.

16:50.796 --> 16:54.414
Be proud and then
keep your back straight, all right?

16:54.884 --> 16:59.712
Very nice, very nice.
Not bad. Come here. Not bad.

17:07.314 --> 17:08.973
Okay, well,
you're still meandering a bit,

17:09.148 --> 17:11.983
so we'll take it from the top.

17:27.169 --> 17:30.170
What do you say we knock off
a little early today, huh?

17:30.339 --> 17:33.375
- lt is pretty slow.
- lt's depressing.

17:33.550 --> 17:35.376
But, hey, it's Thursday.

17:35.553 --> 17:38.340
ln retail,
we live for the weekends, right?

17:39.390 --> 17:41.466
And the occasional rich kid.

17:41.643 --> 17:45.557
- David.
- lnsecure. Needs approval.

17:45.772 --> 17:47.848
Price is no object.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.358
Go for it.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.268
Hi.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.439
l couldn't remember
which store you worked at.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.608
Well, you came to the right place.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.195
Look, remember
how Donna was saying

17:59.370 --> 18:01.196
that since her birthday
was on Christmas Day,

18:01.372 --> 18:03.115
nobody ever remembered it?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.833
Well, l didn't remember it either,

18:05.001 --> 18:07.326
so l wanted to get her
something really nice.

18:07.504 --> 18:11.039
Something really nice
or something really special?

18:11.216 --> 18:13.255
Well, like a scarf or something.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.707
How about a bottle of perfume?

18:14.887 --> 18:16.713
You know,
Donna was in here just the other day

18:16.889 --> 18:18.383
and she flipped over this fragrance.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.181
She did?

18:21.394 --> 18:23.517
- Sewy, huh?
- Yeah.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.769
lt's imported directly from France.

18:26.941 --> 18:29.610
- So how much?
- A hundred and ninety dollars.

18:30.570 --> 18:33.108
lsn't that kind of a lot
for such a little bottle?

18:33.323 --> 18:35.149
Yeah, but if you truly
wanna make a statement,

18:35.325 --> 18:37.198
then price is no object, right?

18:38.412 --> 18:39.989
Well, l don't know, Brenda.

18:43.376 --> 18:46.792
Look, David,
we're closing in 1 5 minutes.

18:46.963 --> 18:48.291
lf you want the perfume, fine.

18:48.465 --> 18:50.790
lf not, l can always show you
some socks.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.546
So she really flipped over it, huh?

18:57.558 --> 18:59.431
Cash or charge?

19:00.603 --> 19:01.634
Perfect.

19:08.111 --> 19:09.309
l'll try to track down Davina,

19:09.487 --> 19:11.859
see if we can get a better fit
on your dress.

19:12.032 --> 19:14.273
You know how she panics
doing last-minute alterations.

19:14.451 --> 19:15.826
So do the full warm-down,

19:15.994 --> 19:18.485
and l'll be back as soon as l can
to pick you up.

19:18.664 --> 19:20.870
- l could give her a ride.
- That won't be necessary.

19:21.041 --> 19:22.120
Come on, Coach K.

19:22.334 --> 19:25.584
There's no need for you to be driving
back and forth across the city.

19:26.964 --> 19:28.209
Thirty minutes of warm-downs.

19:28.383 --> 19:30.874
Go directly home.
Be there in an hour. Understood?

19:31.094 --> 19:32.173
Promise.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.503
- Understood?
- Promise.

19:43.274 --> 19:46.061
What's with that guy?
He acts like he's your father.

19:46.235 --> 19:47.895
Well, in some ways, he is.

19:48.362 --> 19:50.070
There's not a lot of coaches
in Fort Worth,

19:50.239 --> 19:53.690
so when he offered to take me on,
l moved in with him and his wife.

19:53.868 --> 19:55.611
And what about your family?

19:55.787 --> 20:00.164
Well, my mom visits when she can,
but l've got two sisters.

20:00.334 --> 20:01.614
And everyone's already given up

20:01.794 --> 20:04.166
more than enough
to further my career.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.547
Like what?

20:07.466 --> 20:11.001
Trips to the rink at 6 a.m.,
travelling to competitions,

20:11.220 --> 20:15.052
new boots all the time,
coaching, medical treatments,

20:15.225 --> 20:17.431
convincing me to stay with it.

20:17.602 --> 20:21.220
- You wanted to quit?
- At least twice a day.

20:21.398 --> 20:23.307
Well, obviously, it's been worth it.

20:23.484 --> 20:25.772
l mean,
you're trying out for the Olympics.

20:25.986 --> 20:27.777
l mean, l look
at how motivated you are

20:27.947 --> 20:30.105
and what you've accomplished,

20:30.283 --> 20:33.486
and l feel like l've been wasting
the best years of my life.

20:33.661 --> 20:39.331
Wasting? How can you say that?
At least you have a normal life.

20:39.501 --> 20:41.209
l've never had a date.

20:41.420 --> 20:42.665
l eat what l'm told.

20:42.838 --> 20:44.711
l've never been to a real school.

20:45.382 --> 20:48.667
Well, a lot of people's futures
are riding on how my career goes.

20:48.844 --> 20:50.552
That is a lot of pressure.

20:51.639 --> 20:53.678
Team Trisha.

20:55.685 --> 20:58.223
So, what happens
when the skating's over?

21:00.607 --> 21:05.150
Well, l'm a big fan of L.A. Law.
Maybe l'll go to law school.

21:06.488 --> 21:08.196
Now let me ask you a question:

21:08.365 --> 21:11.200
lf you weren't here right now,
where would you be?

21:17.750 --> 21:20.205
Happy belated birthday, Donna.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.249
Oh, David, you didn't have to.

21:24.424 --> 21:26.215
You said everybody
forgets your birthday,

21:26.385 --> 21:28.757
so l just wanted you to know
that l'm not everybody.

21:28.971 --> 21:30.762
Donna, open it.

21:34.101 --> 21:36.389
- Oh, David.
- You don't like it?

21:37.605 --> 21:41.223
lt's just so expensive.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.603
Well, you're worth it.

21:46.907 --> 21:49.445
Brenda, l can't believe you would
sell him something so pricey.

21:49.618 --> 21:51.326
l didn't put a gun to his head.

21:51.495 --> 21:54.994
And don't look now, but it does appear
the customers are very satisfied.

22:00.463 --> 22:02.123
What's her problem?

22:02.298 --> 22:04.871
She just resents the fact
that l'm getting good at my job.

22:05.051 --> 22:06.877
So things are going
pretty good for you, huh?

22:07.053 --> 22:09.341
Yeah. l mean, the power
to persuade someone

22:09.514 --> 22:11.553
to buy something
they didn't even know they wanted,

22:11.725 --> 22:13.966
there's nothing like it in the world.

22:14.144 --> 22:15.721
Nothing?

22:19.025 --> 22:21.895
Hey, guys. Like to introduce you
to my friend Trisha Kinney.

22:22.070 --> 22:25.024
Trisha, this is David, Donna, Kelly,

22:25.198 --> 22:27.237
and of course, my sister, Brenda,
who's a big fan.

22:27.409 --> 22:28.440
Absolutely.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.901
And of course you know Dylan
and Steve from the rink.

22:31.079 --> 22:32.656
You're much taller standing up.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.958
Thanks.

22:37.169 --> 22:38.367
Pull up a seat.

22:38.546 --> 22:40.503
We can't. l wanted
to show Trish where l worked.

22:40.673 --> 22:41.704
- You sure?
- Yeah.

22:41.883 --> 22:44.837
Coach says l gotta get her home
and rested. Sectionals are in two days.

22:45.053 --> 22:46.630
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

22:46.971 --> 22:48.631
lf you're not doing anything
on Saturday,

22:48.807 --> 22:50.431
l'd like you all to come,
be my guests.

22:50.767 --> 22:52.095
Well, thanks. Maybe we will.

22:52.311 --> 22:55.514
- Okay, see you.
- Trish.

22:57.816 --> 22:58.895
The store where l work,

22:59.068 --> 23:02.852
we sell the cutest leotards
in the Western world.

23:03.072 --> 23:06.108
You know, l think we're witnessing
the beginning of a new era.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.656
You ain't seen nothing yet.

23:25.722 --> 23:28.925
- That was great.
- No, she missed her toe loop.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.851
You can tell
by the position of the foot...

23:32.020 --> 23:33.893
Never mind.

23:46.202 --> 23:47.233
Hey, man.

23:47.412 --> 23:49.653
Glad you could make it.
l was about to give up on you.

23:49.831 --> 23:50.910
Where's Bren?

23:51.124 --> 23:52.155
She was gonna come,

23:52.334 --> 23:54.789
but then she decided
that it would be a good ''career move''

23:54.961 --> 23:57.416
to stay at the store
and take inventory with Diedre.

23:57.631 --> 23:59.173
Told you.

24:03.095 --> 24:04.126
How's Trish doing?

24:04.346 --> 24:07.382
- Not too well in the short programme.
- Yeah, but it's do-or-die time now.

24:07.558 --> 24:10.761
lf she makes this double axel,
she could still pull it out.

24:40.969 --> 24:42.463
l couldn't feel the ice.

24:42.638 --> 24:47.015
Hey, every skater has a bad day.
You're entitled.

24:47.184 --> 24:48.594
What about the finals?

24:49.604 --> 24:51.727
You finished fifth, honey.

24:52.398 --> 24:54.271
Season is over for this year,
l'm sorry.

24:54.734 --> 24:56.975
And that's it?

24:57.153 --> 24:59.394
Listen, why don't you go to Texas
for a while, huh?

24:59.614 --> 25:01.405
Spend some time there
with your parents.

25:01.575 --> 25:05.359
Decide really
if you wanna gear up for '94.

25:06.747 --> 25:08.656
l'll see you at home.

25:14.130 --> 25:16.003
lt's okay.

25:18.635 --> 25:20.343
Why do l feel like this is my fault?

25:20.554 --> 25:22.048
Brandon, please.

25:22.222 --> 25:25.673
lt's your fault l can't land a jump
l haven't missed since l was 1 2?

25:25.893 --> 25:28.384
Yeah, but it's like Coach K said,
l'm a distraction.

25:30.022 --> 25:33.438
He also said
maybe l didn't wanna win.

25:35.737 --> 25:38.310
Well, the good news is
we can have that date now.

25:55.258 --> 25:57.250
Brenda, lay off Mom.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.460
Mom knows l'm just trying
to accent her cheekbones

25:59.637 --> 26:01.345
to neutralise the age thing.

26:02.349 --> 26:05.053
No thanks, honey. l don't think so.

26:05.227 --> 26:09.307
- All right, whatever.
- Well, l like those old cheekbones.

26:09.481 --> 26:14.273
- Oh, l didn't mean it like that.
- Oh, l know, l know.

26:14.445 --> 26:17.018
lf that's for me, tell them l'm gone.

26:22.954 --> 26:23.985
What?

26:24.164 --> 26:27.367
So you'll say just about anything these
days to make a commission. ls that it?

26:28.543 --> 26:31.994
You know, Diedre predicted
that this would start happening to me.

26:32.172 --> 26:33.203
What?

26:33.424 --> 26:36.959
l'm sorry that everybody is put off
by the idea of an independent woman

26:37.136 --> 26:40.884
trying to take an aggressive posture
in pursuit of a specific goal.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.219
Which is to have my own car

26:42.392 --> 26:44.799
so l never have to depend on you
for a ride to school again.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.182
Oh, touche.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.595
Your friend Trisha
knows exactly what l'm talking about.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.351
And if you don't believe me, ask her.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.271
Why don't you ask her yourself?
She's gonna stop by school today.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.859
- Really? That's great. l liked her.
- Yeah.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.154
- She's special.
- Yeah.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.612
Did she mention anything to you

26:59.785 --> 27:01.991
about the leotards
l sent over last week?

27:03.540 --> 27:04.619
Just asking.

27:14.593 --> 27:16.716
And here's the one person
you haven't met yet.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.049
This is my partner in crime,

27:18.222 --> 27:19.930
Andrea Zuckerman,
editor of the Blaze.

27:20.099 --> 27:22.637
Andrea, l would like you
to meet Trisha Kinney.

27:22.852 --> 27:24.891
l know who this is.
lt's great meeting you.

27:25.063 --> 27:26.806
l really admire your work.

27:27.857 --> 27:29.980
- You follow skating?
- Are you kidding?

27:30.193 --> 27:32.351
l went through a major
wanna-be-a-figure-skater phase

27:32.529 --> 27:34.521
when l was younger,
but as l grew up, my...

27:34.698 --> 27:36.607
My centre of gravity
kept shifting on me.

27:37.159 --> 27:38.273
Tell me about it.

27:38.452 --> 27:41.572
So you guys doing an interview?
l think that's great.

27:41.747 --> 27:45.080
No, actually, it's more of a date.

27:47.587 --> 27:49.413
That's nice too.

27:51.967 --> 27:54.837
So you wanna come with us
for lunch?

27:56.096 --> 27:57.969
Well, l'd love to,

27:58.140 --> 28:00.678
but l really have to stay here
and grease the Linotype machine.

28:01.394 --> 28:04.845
But you go ahead.
Have a nice lunch.

28:10.236 --> 28:12.809
Well, if it isn't the lunch bunch.

28:12.989 --> 28:14.649
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, man.

28:14.825 --> 28:17.826
Listen, l'm really sorry
about the sectionals.

28:18.036 --> 28:20.823
- Well, these things happen.
- There's always next year, right?

28:20.998 --> 28:22.456
Or not.

28:22.625 --> 28:24.534
l've got some time off to decide.

28:24.752 --> 28:26.246
- And you came here?
- To school?

28:26.420 --> 28:28.578
Well, this is a big deal for me.
The real world.

28:28.756 --> 28:31.673
- Beverly Hills High School.
- West Beverly.

28:31.885 --> 28:34.720
Yeah, and l wouldn't be so quick
to call it the real world either.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.424
l didn't grow up
in a complete bubble.

28:36.598 --> 28:39.089
Although you're talking to a girl
who's never eaten a Twinkie.

28:39.309 --> 28:41.597
Sorry, it was part
of the official regimen.

28:41.770 --> 28:43.727
Oh, my God.
Let me buy you your first Twinkie.

28:43.898 --> 28:46.768
No, no, no. You have to try
salt-and-vinegar potato chips.

28:46.984 --> 28:49.142
l think it's gonna take major amounts
of Haagen-Dazs.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.107
Dim sum from Chin Chin is:

28:52.323 --> 28:54.114
- Wolfgang Puck pizza.
- Gum.

28:55.827 --> 28:58.947
Donna, gum is not food.

28:59.581 --> 29:01.906
l don't care. Gum.

29:02.126 --> 29:03.703
- l can't wait.
- Wait, wait, wait.

29:03.878 --> 29:05.586
There's one food that covers it all.

29:05.963 --> 29:08.370
A Pan-American delicacy, if you will.

29:08.674 --> 29:10.084
A food not found in nature,

29:10.259 --> 29:13.343
yet a meal so complete,
you eat the package.

29:13.638 --> 29:18.549
lt's a meal that keeps on giving
hour after hour after hour.

29:18.769 --> 29:19.967
l'm talking about the one,

29:20.479 --> 29:21.807
the only:

29:22.022 --> 29:23.564
The burrito.

29:23.732 --> 29:25.771
l feel like l'm finally part
of the human race.

29:25.943 --> 29:27.603
Well, welcome to it.

29:27.778 --> 29:30.269
This is going straight
to my centre of gravity and l love it.

29:30.448 --> 29:32.654
After today,
nothing's gonna fit me anymore.

29:32.825 --> 29:34.782
Which reminds me,

29:34.994 --> 29:37.235
Brenda wanted me to tell you
about the leotards you got.

29:37.414 --> 29:39.620
They can be embroidered--

29:39.791 --> 29:41.368
Enjoy your burrito, Trish.

29:41.585 --> 29:44.539
- Thanks.
- l'll see you, guys.

29:44.713 --> 29:47.548
- Your friends are great.
- Yeah, they are.

29:47.716 --> 29:49.922
So, what do you wanna do tonight?

29:51.512 --> 29:54.762
- So you like it?
- l love it.

29:54.933 --> 29:57.388
Very ltalian. Very '90s.

29:58.937 --> 30:00.645
l was wondering
when you were getting back.

30:00.814 --> 30:04.349
Joyce.
How have you been, stranger?

30:04.526 --> 30:05.936
Did you get everything you need?

30:06.111 --> 30:08.483
Bought half the store,
thanks to your protege here.

30:08.697 --> 30:10.654
So l see.

30:10.866 --> 30:13.617
You know, this is a little trendy,
but l really like this.

30:13.786 --> 30:15.328
You know what it needs, though?

30:16.164 --> 30:17.658
These are a little extreme,

30:18.166 --> 30:20.621
but l know that you can pull it off.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.708
Oh, what the hell?
At this point, who's counting?

30:23.922 --> 30:25.380
My point exactly.

30:25.966 --> 30:29.132
So, now,
are you still seeing that lawyer?

30:29.345 --> 30:31.800
Oh, we broke up two months ago.
What a jerk.

30:32.014 --> 30:34.006
- Aren't they all?
- Diedre, what are you doing?

30:34.225 --> 30:35.256
Joyce, you know what?

30:35.434 --> 30:38.351
Go pick up a scarf off that rack
over there, huh? On the house.

30:38.521 --> 30:40.893
Oh, thank you.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.777
lf you ring up that sale,
you get to take home the commission.

30:44.945 --> 30:47.021
Well, Joyce has always been
my customer.

30:47.197 --> 30:49.688
Yes, well, l waited on her
for over an hour.

30:50.117 --> 30:53.153
Look, sweetie. We're coming off
the worst Christmas ever,

30:53.329 --> 30:54.574
and business is in the toilet.

30:54.747 --> 30:58.661
l have a car payment to make,
and this is just the way it's gonna be.

30:59.210 --> 31:02.543
- What do you think about this one?
- That is so perfect.

31:02.714 --> 31:03.912
Brenda, can you go in the back

31:04.090 --> 31:06.462
and check to see
if there are some boxes for this stuff?

31:06.676 --> 31:08.668
You know, l heard your book
was getting published.

31:08.845 --> 31:12.344
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.
- Oh, congratulations.

31:14.477 --> 31:17.597
- You ready?
- This is weird.

31:17.772 --> 31:22.066
Of all the things to do on your first
official date, you pick skating.

31:22.235 --> 31:25.818
Well, actually, l always fantasized
that on my first date l'd go dancing.

31:25.989 --> 31:29.073
Dancing.
The one thing l don't do is dance.

31:29.242 --> 31:31.863
l know. But you love to skate, right?

31:32.037 --> 31:34.954
- So?
- So...

31:36.125 --> 31:38.450
May l have this skate?

31:38.628 --> 31:40.205
l don't know about this.

31:40.379 --> 31:44.708
Come on, it's easy.
Relax and feel the ice.

33:34.044 --> 33:35.206
Very nice.

33:35.420 --> 33:37.708
Form needs work,
but there is promise.

33:37.923 --> 33:40.674
Coach K, l'm a civilian now.
l don't need a chaperon.

33:40.884 --> 33:43.172
Here's some news
that might influence your decision:

33:43.345 --> 33:45.551
The Skating Federation
granted a waiver today

33:45.723 --> 33:47.799
for you to compete at sectionals.

33:48.643 --> 33:50.931
- How is that possible?
- Who knows?

33:51.145 --> 33:54.430
Problems in the scoring. Appeals.
lt's all politics.

33:54.774 --> 33:56.184
l don't understand.

33:56.359 --> 33:58.019
They're giving me
another chance, Brandon.

33:58.195 --> 34:01.149
- l could still get to the finals.
- Hey, that's great.

34:01.365 --> 34:03.274
But we have to be at Salt Lake City
on Thursday.

34:03.450 --> 34:05.276
That leaves only five days
to get ready.

34:05.452 --> 34:07.076
And since it's still early...

34:07.997 --> 34:09.407
We have to start tonight?

34:09.623 --> 34:11.996
Trisha, everybody knows
you're getting an exemption.

34:12.168 --> 34:13.578
The judges will be gunning for you.

34:13.753 --> 34:15.377
l wanna rechoreograph
the programme.

34:15.547 --> 34:18.038
Add a new combination
and take out the double Lutz.

34:19.801 --> 34:22.373
Oh, Brandon, l'm sorry.

34:22.554 --> 34:23.964
Look, couldn't this start tomorrow?

34:24.181 --> 34:25.426
No, no, forget it.

34:26.225 --> 34:29.724
You've spent the last nine years
working for this, Trisha.

34:30.228 --> 34:33.728
What's one lousy date? lt can wait.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.643
Really.

34:37.195 --> 34:38.938
Thank you.

34:44.411 --> 34:45.525
You know what we could try?

34:46.371 --> 34:48.328
A triple flip.

34:48.791 --> 34:50.867
You're determined to be
the death of me, aren't you?

34:51.043 --> 34:53.878
But just let me show you
what l can do. You'll see.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.563
- Getting an early start, huh?
- Yeah.

35:20.742 --> 35:24.241
- We have a practise today.
- l know, Dad. l'll be there.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.541
Hey, Sallie.

35:39.762 --> 35:40.793
Morning, Brandon.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.715
Team Trisha's
back from the dead, huh?

35:42.891 --> 35:44.349
Yeah.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.804
Look, today's practise session
is closed to all visitors,

35:47.980 --> 35:50.103
so l'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.473
Listen, Sal,
you just tell the coach that l--

35:52.651 --> 35:55.106
No, this didn't come from Kluklinski.

35:55.905 --> 35:57.399
lt was Trisha's idea.

36:12.714 --> 36:16.414
Hey, sleepy,
your alarm went off half an hour ago.

36:16.635 --> 36:17.915
Time to face the day.

36:18.137 --> 36:21.387
- Why?
- Don't you have work today?

36:21.557 --> 36:22.755
No comment.

36:23.518 --> 36:24.928
What's the matter?

36:27.105 --> 36:28.599
Mom,

36:28.773 --> 36:31.180
you don't know
how awful it was yesterday.

36:31.818 --> 36:34.059
Well, what happened?

36:34.238 --> 36:36.444
l was looking at a $500 commission,

36:36.657 --> 36:38.530
and Diedre ripped it off.
l mean, literally.

36:38.701 --> 36:41.073
She grabbed the sales slip
right out of my hand.

36:41.287 --> 36:44.572
She did?
But l thought you were so close.

36:44.749 --> 36:47.156
So did l.
l just wanted to quit yesterday,

36:47.335 --> 36:50.205
but you and Dad always make
a big point about how we're not quitters.

36:50.380 --> 36:52.918
Walking away from a rotten situation
isn't quitting.

36:53.133 --> 36:55.837
Especially when you've been doing
such a great job.

36:56.261 --> 36:58.965
Yeah, well, l've been
kind of obnoxious lately, haven't l?

36:59.140 --> 37:02.057
Well, maybe you've gone
a little overboard,

37:02.518 --> 37:06.017
but that doesn't give her the right
to treat you like that.

37:06.189 --> 37:08.680
l just tried to do what Grandpa said:

37:08.858 --> 37:11.894
''Service with a smile,''
for all the good that did me.

37:12.112 --> 37:15.029
Yes, but you don't remember
what Grandma used to say:

37:15.198 --> 37:17.237
''Don't get mad, get even.''

37:40.059 --> 37:43.143
Brenda can help you
with anything else, okay?

37:46.649 --> 37:50.777
- Hermes is magnificent, isn't it? And--
- l'll take it.

37:50.945 --> 37:52.818
l find l just can't
get enough of these.

37:53.114 --> 37:55.984
- Does this one come in other colours?
- Oh, yes, it certainly does.

37:56.201 --> 37:58.952
Good. What else can you show me?

38:05.294 --> 38:08.579
Next time, pass the puck, hotshot.

38:08.756 --> 38:11.673
Cover the wing, Brandon.
lt's a team sport. Come on, hustle.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.004
Come on.

38:14.220 --> 38:16.758
Energy, energy, energy.
Come on, now, make a shot.

38:16.932 --> 38:20.016
Oh, it's a save! All right!

38:20.227 --> 38:21.970
- Good one, Steve.
- Way to go, Steve.

38:22.146 --> 38:23.688
All right.

38:23.897 --> 38:25.605
Brandon.

38:31.239 --> 38:32.781
- What's wrong, son?
- Nothing's wrong.

38:32.949 --> 38:34.526
l missed a setup.
What's the big deal?

38:34.701 --> 38:36.243
Why don't you tell me
what the deal is?

38:36.411 --> 38:37.869
Obviously, your head's not into it.

38:38.038 --> 38:40.030
Take your skates off
so you don't hurt yourself.

38:40.207 --> 38:42.413
Fine. Whatever you say, coach.

38:42.584 --> 38:45.157
Hey, hey, hey, Brandon.

38:49.926 --> 38:51.752
Whatever happened
with that girl this morning,

38:51.928 --> 38:54.004
it's not the end of the world, is it?

38:55.682 --> 38:57.970
She was something special, huh?

38:59.686 --> 39:01.477
Let me put it to you this way, Dad:

39:02.439 --> 39:04.811
l didn't even try to kiss her.

39:05.609 --> 39:07.518
That is special.

39:09.405 --> 39:11.730
Dad, let me ask you a question.

39:12.283 --> 39:16.233
When l was a kid and l was winning
all those trophies at the Y,

39:16.412 --> 39:19.911
well, why didn't you and Mom
encourage me to skate competitively?

39:20.125 --> 39:23.245
We did encourage you.
We just didn't push you.

39:24.755 --> 39:26.628
Didn't think
l could take the pressure, huh?

39:28.217 --> 39:31.253
Brandon, you don't know this,
but your mother actually had a meeting

39:31.429 --> 39:34.465
with one of the best coaches
in the Midwest.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.012
And he asked us one key question:

39:37.185 --> 39:39.473
Do we wanna have a superstar,

39:39.646 --> 39:41.104
or do we wanna have a son?

39:43.191 --> 39:46.192
l hope you're not disappointed
with the choice we made.

39:49.239 --> 39:50.982
l think l can live with it.

39:53.035 --> 39:54.315
Wanna get back on the ice?

39:55.580 --> 39:58.284
No, l think l better go to work.

39:58.458 --> 40:01.993
- All right. Catch you at home.
- Yeah.

40:02.170 --> 40:03.830
Hey, Dad.

40:05.507 --> 40:06.538
Thanks.

40:07.759 --> 40:09.253
Yeah.

40:11.055 --> 40:12.134
See you later.

40:20.064 --> 40:22.851
So where did lmelda Marcos go?

40:23.026 --> 40:26.359
She's outside feeding her meter.
Now, are you taking notes on this?

40:26.530 --> 40:28.606
She is the kind of woman
that we dream about.

40:28.782 --> 40:30.359
She knows exactly what she wants,

40:30.534 --> 40:33.025
she isn't afraid to shell out money
for quality merchandise,

40:33.203 --> 40:35.990
and she has good taste,
but not too discriminating.

40:36.165 --> 40:40.328
She's a very quality person
and she treats herself accordingly.

40:40.503 --> 40:41.913
And l'm also very proud to say

40:42.088 --> 40:44.839
that this looks like it could be
the largest single commission

40:45.008 --> 40:48.044
in what is turning out
to be a very good year.

40:48.220 --> 40:51.304
Now, watch how l button this down.

40:51.515 --> 40:53.258
Too late. Oh, well.

40:54.727 --> 40:56.269
Oh, please, let us take care of that.

40:56.437 --> 40:58.560
And let me have the girl
get you another cappuccino.

40:58.731 --> 41:00.355
No, thank you.

41:00.566 --> 41:04.480
You know, l'm standing here
looking at this belt, and l'm thinking:

41:04.654 --> 41:06.362
l don't really need this.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.483
No. l mean, it isn't you.

41:10.660 --> 41:14.954
And l'm wondering
if l need all those blouses.

41:15.124 --> 41:17.081
l don't know.
You just have such good taste.

41:18.461 --> 41:20.169
Why don't you leave
whatever you don't want

41:20.338 --> 41:22.211
and l'll have the girl
put them away for you?

41:23.299 --> 41:25.172
And l really don't need the scarves.

41:25.677 --> 41:27.503
Or the shoes.

41:28.138 --> 41:31.507
- You don't?
- No, l don't.

41:32.893 --> 41:35.300
No scarves, no shoes,
no $1 00 wrinkle creams,

41:35.479 --> 41:38.349
and l really don't need you telling me
how much you love my good taste,

41:38.566 --> 41:39.894
or how happy this will make me,

41:40.109 --> 41:42.564
or how great l'll look,
or how much l deserve this,

41:42.778 --> 41:43.857
or how much l deserve that.

41:44.030 --> 41:45.109
And most of all,

41:45.323 --> 41:48.277
l really don't need you kissing my butt
to pad your commission

41:48.493 --> 41:51.280
while you treat
your employees badly.

41:51.788 --> 41:54.492
But thanks so much
for taking care of this.

41:54.666 --> 41:56.290
You deserve it.

41:58.796 --> 42:01.583
What a bitch.

42:02.174 --> 42:03.751
Yeah.

42:20.945 --> 42:22.439
So, what's good?

42:23.823 --> 42:27.274
lf it doesn't raise your cholesterol level,
you won't find it on this menu.

42:29.454 --> 42:32.574
Shouldn't you be at dance class?
Or at your sports psychologist?

42:32.749 --> 42:34.907
Mr. K's in the car.
We're on the way to the airport.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.876
But l...

42:37.045 --> 42:39.452
l didn't wanna leave
without saying goodbye.

42:43.177 --> 42:44.208
Goodbye.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.764
- l'm sorry l closed the practise today.
- There's no need to explain.

42:48.933 --> 42:50.308
Well, yes, there is.

42:50.727 --> 42:52.636
lt's not coach, or my parents,

42:52.812 --> 42:54.935
or anyone else
that drives me to do this.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.220
lt's me.

42:56.441 --> 42:57.983
lt's what l want.

42:58.193 --> 42:59.984
To be the best skater in the world.

43:00.153 --> 43:03.107
To go to the Olympics. To turn pro.

43:03.282 --> 43:05.155
To be a star.

43:05.367 --> 43:07.324
And what was l,
a two-week distraction?

43:08.663 --> 43:10.489
You don't believe that, do you?

43:10.832 --> 43:13.453
You know what hurts me the most?

43:13.626 --> 43:15.334
ls it was okay with me.

43:15.503 --> 43:17.412
l was willing to show up
at 5:30 every morning

43:17.631 --> 43:18.829
and take what l could get.

43:19.007 --> 43:21.924
But how fair would that have been
to either of us?

43:26.557 --> 43:28.099
You know, l'll always remember you

43:28.267 --> 43:30.758
as the guy who gave me
my first burrito.

43:33.272 --> 43:37.519
l'll always remember you
as the girl who got me to dance.

43:52.835 --> 43:56.251
We're watching Trisha Kinney
of Fort Worth, Texas.

43:56.422 --> 44:00.170
Young lady
who trains in Los Angeles.

44:00.343 --> 44:05.052
Has a good opportunity
to do quite well in competition.

44:05.224 --> 44:06.932
Split-jump combination.

44:07.101 --> 44:09.508
Double toe loop,
very neat and clean.

44:16.694 --> 44:18.152
Double jump, excellent.

44:18.363 --> 44:22.526
That was the double axel. She did it.
Way to go, Trisha.

44:22.742 --> 44:24.152
She's gonna win this thing, man.

44:24.327 --> 44:27.244
How can someone so fragile-looking
have all that strength?

44:28.123 --> 44:29.617
Fire and ice.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.329
And her final spin, very, very tight.

44:34.505 --> 44:38.419
That's a scratch spin.
The arms over the head, very nice.

44:38.593 --> 44:41.547
Very nice moves for Trisha Kinney
of Fort Worth, Texas,

44:41.721 --> 44:45.054
a young lady we should see
a lot more of in coming years.

44:46.435 --> 44:48.842
You were wonderful.

44:49.938 --> 44:52.263
Trisha, congratulations.
lt's moments like this

44:52.441 --> 44:55.726
that make all the years
of hard work and sacrifice worth it.

44:55.903 --> 44:58.738
Definitely, of course it is.

44:58.906 --> 45:03.117
But to tell you the truth,
l do miss those burritos.

45:03.328 --> 45:05.036
Well, that wraps up
the ladies' competition

45:05.205 --> 45:07.114
here in Salt Lake.

45:07.582 --> 45:09.242
You okay?

45:10.169 --> 45:11.877
Hey,

45:12.046 --> 45:13.872
l had the time of my life.

45:15.800 --> 45:16.998
Right now, this is Dick Button

45:17.176 --> 45:20.046
saying thank you
for joining us here in Salt Lake.
