THAT PIECE OF INFORMATION,

41:29.304 --> 41:30.970
I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY
A CORRELATION THERE.

41:30.972 --> 41:33.706
I MEAN,
THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

41:33.708 --> 41:36.242
WE MIGHT HAVE TO MONITOR MORE

41:36.244 --> 41:37.577
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
ARE COMING IN HERE --

41:37.579 --> 41:38.978
MM-HMM.

41:38.980 --> 41:40.980
...BECAUSE WE DON'T --
LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING,

41:40.982 --> 41:42.715
I DON'T WANT IT TO
CONTINUE TO ESCALATE.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.050
-RIGHT.
-RIGHT.

41:44.052 --> 41:45.118
AND AS FAR AS LIKE WHERE
YOU CAN GO FROM HERE,

41:45.120 --> 41:46.386
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE DID GET

41:46.388 --> 41:47.320
THROUGH THE LIGHT EXPERIMENT

41:47.322 --> 41:48.454
WAS THAT IT DIDN'T
WANNA BE HERE.

41:48.456 --> 41:49.722
OKAY.

41:49.724 --> 41:50.723
WE ASKED,
"DO YOU WANNA BE HERE

41:50.725 --> 41:51.924
OR DO YOU WANNA
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?"

41:51.926 --> 41:53.192
AND IT WOULD LIGHT UP.
-ALL RIGHT.

41:53.194 --> 41:55.127
SO I WOULD JUST SAY KEEP AN EYE
ON WHO'S COMING IN HERE --

41:55.129 --> 41:56.262
OKAY.

41:56.264 --> 41:58.330
...AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN
AND IF YOU WANT TO,

41:58.332 --> 42:01.000
TRY TO GET THIS THING
TO GO OUT THE DOOR.

42:01.002 --> 42:02.635
YEAH.
APPRECIATE YOU GUYS COMING IN.

42:02.637 --> 42:03.903
-AWESOME.
-AWESOME.

42:03.905 --> 42:05.004
REALLY APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING, GUYS.

42:05.006 --> 42:06.472
THANK YOU.

42:06.474 --> 42:07.941
ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE. KEEP IN
TOUCH. I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.342
ABSOLUTELY.

42:09.344 --> 42:12.144
THIS IS THE FIRST HAUNTED
SCHOOL I'VE EVER INVESTIGATED.

42:12.146 --> 42:16.015
AFTER 72 HOURS, I FEEL LIKE
IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT

42:16.017 --> 42:18.618
THAN ANY OTHER LOCATION
I'VE EVER INVESTIGATED,

42:18.620 --> 42:20.720
AND THE MOST
FASCINATING PART TO ME

42:20.722 --> 42:25.024
IS SEEING THIS SHADOW MAN
WITH MY OWN EYES.

42:25.026 --> 42:27.694
THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

42:27.696 --> 42:32.565
SO FOREVER, I WILL NEVER
FORGET THE HIGGINSPORT SCHOOL.
