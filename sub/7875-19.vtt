Morning, neighbor.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.792
Reading the newspaper,
huh, Mr. S?

00:48.917 --> 00:51.667
Not me. Can't do it anymore.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.417
Too depressing.
Bums my apex, man.

00:56.917 --> 00:58.458
Damn it, Hayley.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.792
I don't care if your deadbeat
boyfriend lives in his van,

00:59.792 --> 01:01.917
but he's not gonna do it
in front of my house.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.291
Too bad.
He's on public property.

01:03.291 --> 01:06.333
He lives in his van?
How bohemian.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.375
You know, I'm a little
boho myself.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.375
I once pierced
my glocknick.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.583
Unfortunately, it was
my left glocknick.

01:12.583 --> 01:14.333
Didn't know the code.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.750
Can't tell you how many
people tried to pee on me
that summer.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.125
I want that van gone

01:18.125 --> 01:19.375
by the time I get home
from work!

01:19.375 --> 01:20.709
Well, the law says he can

01:20.709 --> 01:22.542
park out there as long
as he wants.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.542
The law is on his side.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.000
If I wanna get rid of Jeff,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.166
I'll have to do something
cunning and subtle.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.041
Whoa! What a freak
accident!

01:37.041 --> 01:38.583
Thanks, Eddie.
What do I owe ya?

01:38.583 --> 01:41.500
Just tell your friends.
My business is word of mouth.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.959
But don't you have to start
charging eventually?

01:43.959 --> 01:45.083
Eventually.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.917
♪ If looks could kill

You're a shotgun, bang ♪

01:49.917 --> 01:52.375
What's up with that thang.
I wanna know.

01:52.375 --> 01:53.667
How does it hang?

01:53.667 --> 01:55.291
What the hell
are you doing?

01:55.291 --> 01:56.583
You shave your chest?

01:56.583 --> 01:59.083
What? No! It's for work.
Get out of my shower!

01:59.083 --> 02:00.625
You're the one
who crushed his van.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.542
Why can't Jeff live
with his family?

02:02.542 --> 02:04.709
He hasn't spoken to
his dad in years,

02:04.709 --> 02:06.959
and his mom ran away
before he was born.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.792
How...
How could she do that?

02:09.792 --> 02:11.417
I heard you
showering with Jeff.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.291
I finally get to meet him.
How do I look?

02:13.291 --> 02:15.166
Like an alien.
Put on a disguise.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.875
I'm not gonna wear a disguise.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.250
But you love disguises.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.083
What? Where'd you get
that idea?

02:20.083 --> 02:23.083
You can't go five minutes
without doing a fashion
montage.

02:23.083 --> 02:27.083
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.
I hate disguises.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.750
And I'd rather stay
in the attic
than wear your uniform.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.333
-Then stay in the attic.
-It's my body!

02:34.667 --> 02:36.500
If I can't get to know Jeff
face-to-face,

02:36.500 --> 02:37.792
like a regular person,

02:37.792 --> 02:39.291
then I'll build
a relationship with him

02:39.291 --> 02:42.166
like fat people do,
through the Internet.

02:42.166 --> 02:45.000
Now, I just have to find all
the info on Jeff I can.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.542
Well, qu'est-ce que c'est
que ca?

02:51.834 --> 02:54.667
Ho-ho. Muy buena
comida, Mrs. S.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.709
Hey, did I ever tell you guys
about this choice burrito
I had...

02:57.709 --> 03:01.000
when I was backpacking
that summer I was super
into rabbits?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.542
The dude who makes them
uses a syringe,

03:03.542 --> 03:07.417
to inject a squirt of sour
cream into the center
of each bean.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.208
Ridiculous.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.834
You get pretty bad fire hole,
but it's totally worth it.

03:11.834 --> 03:12.959
All right, that's it.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.333
Get out! Get out
of my house!

03:14.333 --> 03:17.250
-Stan!
-Look, Jeff is a part
of my life, okay?

03:17.250 --> 03:20.000
In fact, we might even
get married one day.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.291
So you might as well
get used to him.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.750
"Married"? Oh, babe.

03:23.750 --> 03:27.250
Mr. S, you are so set.
Wait right here.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.375
Look, honey,
I'll make you a deal.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.583
You don't marry Jeff,
and I won't bake you
a roofie cake

03:31.583 --> 03:34.375
and tie your fallopians
in a square knot.

03:34.375 --> 03:37.750
Here, Mr. S. I wanted
to give you my wedding dowry
in advance.

03:37.750 --> 03:41.458
Two ponchos and a flute
that summons a leprechaun.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.834
You can only use
it three times.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.500
So choose wisely.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.625
Where's my hacksaw?

03:47.625 --> 03:49.333
I wanna kill Jeff
with my hacksaw.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.083
Stan, there's an easier way
to get rid of Jeff.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.333
What? I thought you wanted
to be his friend.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.959
Yeah, I'm over that.
Look at this.

03:57.542 --> 04:00.333
There's a bounty on his head
in Florida.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.709
A few years ago, he got

04:01.709 --> 04:04.625
caught with 300 pounds of pot,
but he skipped bail.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.166
This is perfect!

04:06.166 --> 04:08.458
If he goes to prison, he'll
be out of my life forever.

04:08.458 --> 04:11.333
Plus, I can use
the reward money
to buy some disguises.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.667
I don't know if you know this,
but I love disguises.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.500
There's no way you can
transport a criminal
to Florida.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.250
Are you kidding?
There's a rich tradition
of alien bounty hunters.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.333
I just have to decide
on the right look.

04:23.333 --> 04:27.792
Which means... it's time
for another Roger
fashion montage.

04:38.625 --> 04:42.166
Stan! Damn you
and your one outfit!

04:42.166 --> 04:45.083
Wow. I can't believe
you're taking me
to a baseball game.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.375
I know. I can't believe
you believe that either.

04:53.542 --> 04:56.834
So, you never told me.
Who's playing in this
baseball game, Dad?

04:56.834 --> 05:00.291
I'm not your dad!
You have your own dad.

05:00.291 --> 05:03.166
Actually, we haven't talked
in a few years.

05:03.166 --> 05:05.667
I got involved in a little
trouble, and, well,

05:05.667 --> 05:08.291
if he found out,
it would really
disappoint him.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.291
Are you and your dad close?

05:10.291 --> 05:12.208
Daddy, will you read to me?

05:12.208 --> 05:14.458
Who the hell are you?

05:14.458 --> 05:17.083
Uh, yeah, sure.

05:18.750 --> 05:19.834
What the...

05:24.250 --> 05:26.041
You poached my bear!

05:28.333 --> 05:31.750
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm taking my bounty back!

05:31.750 --> 05:33.875
What's your problem?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.875
Oh, you mean
besides being shot at
by a bottom-heavy freak?

05:36.875 --> 05:40.083
You know it's awkward
when I try to jog.

05:40.083 --> 05:43.291
Listen, I'll overlook
the fact that you didn't
compliment my outfit

05:43.291 --> 05:45.917
if you let me take Jeff
and go collect my money.

05:45.917 --> 05:48.250
I don't care about the money!
I just wanna get Jeff

05:48.250 --> 05:50.166
down to Florida
and out of my life.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.417
-You're turning me in?
-Look, Jeff--

05:54.667 --> 05:56.083
Damn it, Roger.
He's getting away.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.250
-Why didn't you run for it?
-You wanna know why?

06:02.208 --> 06:03.792
Because I didn't
think of it.

06:05.917 --> 06:08.291
O'Shamus McPherson,
present yourself.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.083
Where's my leprechaun?

06:17.250 --> 06:20.417
Great. Well, Roger,
I guess it's just you and me.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.000
And now it's just me.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.959
Wait. How am I gonna
get out of here?

06:24.959 --> 06:27.500
Try jogging,
you gross bowling pin!

06:30.375 --> 06:31.750
Yo, you flute me?

06:31.750 --> 06:34.041
What? No, no. That was Jeff.
He hopped on the train.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.500
Oh, Jeff, huh?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.875
Well, uh, you tell your boy
this still counts as one.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.750
He got two left.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.750
Mmm. They love me.

06:46.166 --> 06:49.500
So I took the train
to Raleigh, and now
I'm at my dad's farm.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.583
Just stay right there.
I'm coming to get you.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.208
Mom, you won't believe this.
Dad kidnapped Jeff.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.333
But he got away.
And now he's hiding
at his dad's farm.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.041
Ooh, there's lots of places
to hide on a farm.

06:59.041 --> 07:01.625
Cornfields, a silo,

07:01.625 --> 07:04.166
behind a cow,
under a tractor--

07:04.166 --> 07:06.625
-Mom, we gotta save Jeff!
-Right.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.583
You tell Steve.
I'll grab my keys.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.083
Yeah?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.166
Hello, Stan?
I know where Jeff is.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.834
But, first, I'm gonna
need something from you.

07:16.834 --> 07:19.166
Can we take one of those
old Western photos together?

07:21.917 --> 07:23.792
I'll get it, Dad.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.667
Hi, Jeff.

07:27.667 --> 07:31.208
Expecting someone a little
less take you to jaily?

07:31.208 --> 07:32.959
Wait. You gotta believe me.

07:32.959 --> 07:35.375
I don't know how that pot
got in my van.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.458
You had a loose nail there.
And I don't believe you.

07:39.458 --> 07:42.458
All right, I'll go with you!

07:42.458 --> 07:45.041
Just let me spend
one last night with my dad.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.834
-Forget it.
-I'm begging you.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.166
I won't get to see him
for a long time.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.667
I wanna memorize
every line in his face,

07:51.667 --> 07:54.583
so I can write a poem about it
for my prison poetry slam.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.041
'Cause that's what
prison's like, right?

07:59.250 --> 08:01.250
Hi. My name's Stan Smith.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.917
I seem to have lost
my credit card.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.750
Can you tell me
the last place I used it?

08:06.041 --> 08:09.417
No, I don't know
my Social Security number.

08:09.417 --> 08:12.291
No, I don't know
my date of birth.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.959
My mother's maiden name?
Uh, something Italian.

08:14.959 --> 08:17.667
- I look Italian.
- Try Frappuccino.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.041
Hold on. I got a beep.
Hello.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.625
Roger, it's me. Jeff and Stan
are at Jeff's father's house
in North Carolina.

08:23.625 --> 08:26.333
-Really?
-Yes.

08:26.333 --> 08:29.875
Now, in return
for this information,
you must give me...

08:29.875 --> 08:31.041
Nothing.

08:31.041 --> 08:33.208
If you had just
waited for me to finish,

08:33.208 --> 08:36.667
you'd know I want
nothing from you!

08:38.291 --> 08:41.000
Oh, hey. I thought
you two went to find Jeff.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.667
Mom can't find her car keys.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.792
Okay, what were you doing
the last time you had them?

08:44.792 --> 08:47.000
Driving. I think
it was the car.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.709
Mom, if we
don't find those keys,
we'll never rescue Jeff.

08:49.709 --> 08:52.458
Did somebody say hot-wire?

08:52.458 --> 08:54.709
-Can you really do that?
-Yes.

08:54.709 --> 08:56.375
And in answer to
your next question,

08:56.375 --> 08:58.375
I like a sneaker
with a large tongue.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.458
So, Dad, Stan's a friend
of mine from Langley Falls.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.041
I've got a pretty
good life up there.

09:05.041 --> 09:07.417
I'm in charge of tire inflation
at the bike shop.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.667
"Tire inflation"?
Oh, that is so great.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.125
Of course, I'm not surprised.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.917
That's just the latest
in a long list of achievements.

09:14.917 --> 09:16.583
I'm so proud of my son.

09:16.583 --> 09:20.083
In fact, this is the wall
where I keep all his awards.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.458
What?
There's nothing there!

09:22.458 --> 09:23.834
Oh, my God!

09:23.834 --> 09:25.875
They've been stolen!
I better call the sheriff.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.041
We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

09:28.041 --> 09:29.125
It's ringing.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.750
Hello, Sheriff Perkins?
Henry Fisher.

09:31.750 --> 09:35.458
Yes, yes, father
of the illustrious Jeff Fisher.

09:35.458 --> 09:38.750
Someone has stolen all
his awards. All of 'em.

09:38.750 --> 09:42.625
Must have been several
strong men with a huge truck--

09:42.625 --> 09:47.000
What? What do you mean
Jeff's never won an award
in his entire life?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.500
But if that were true,

09:48.500 --> 09:51.000
that would mean my son
is a worthless piece of crap

09:51.000 --> 09:53.041
who never accomplished
anything.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.041
Well, sir, I'm not
gonna sit here

09:55.041 --> 09:57.834
while you say those awful
things about my pride and joy.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.458
I promise you, Son,

10:00.458 --> 10:03.291
I will not rest until
I get every single ribbon,

10:03.291 --> 10:06.917
trophy and letter
of commendation
back on that wall.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.041
I'm gonna down to the bar,
round up a posse.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.417
We'll get Charlie's dogs,
close off a perimeter.

10:14.417 --> 10:17.000
You just sit there and keep
on making me proud.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
-Isn't he great?
-"Great"?

10:20.750 --> 10:23.000
Jeff, your dad
is a humongous jerk.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.458
No, he's just kidding around.
He loves me.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.709
That's why he can never
know what happened in Florida.

10:28.709 --> 10:32.041
Look, Jeff, no one
wants to admit their dad
is a bad guy, but--

10:32.041 --> 10:34.041
"Bad guy"?
Look who's talking.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.917
You're the one who
tricked me and pretended
to be my friend.

10:36.917 --> 10:38.875
My dad would never
do anything that mean.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.250
I need something
for Charlie's dogs

10:40.250 --> 10:41.333
so they can pick up the scent.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.291
Do you have
your high school diploma?

10:43.291 --> 10:46.291
No? They got that, too?

10:46.291 --> 10:48.583
Oh, those monsters
are gonna pay.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.917
You can sleep
out in the barn.

10:52.917 --> 10:55.959
Mr. Fisher, don't you
think you're a little
hard on Jeff?

10:55.959 --> 10:57.959
I mean, I like
soul-crushing sarcasm

10:57.959 --> 10:59.208
as much as the next guy.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.208
And kudos on your commitment
to the bit.

11:01.208 --> 11:04.500
- But Jeff is your son.
- And my bounty.

11:06.125 --> 11:10.583
-Who the hell is this?
-Horse Renoir, bounty hunter.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.000
Born in the Bayou.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.583
Some say the hell spawn
of a prostitute and a whore.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.583
-Others say--
-Shut up!

11:16.583 --> 11:19.875
Rude. Your son's wanted
in Florida for a drug bust.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.583
And I'm gonna collect
the bounty. Tie him up.

11:22.583 --> 11:25.333
I got arthritis. I can't even
tie my damn boots.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.000
Oh, my mom had that
real bad, too.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.041
The whore, not the prostitute.
Here, I'll do it.

11:31.041 --> 11:35.834
You don't have arthritis!
Rude. Liar.

11:35.834 --> 11:36.834
Tie him up.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.375
You're gonna help
Jeff escape?

11:38.375 --> 11:40.375
So, you're a good father
after all.

11:40.375 --> 11:43.125
Hell no. I just wanna
collect that bounty.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.375
It'll cover my losses

11:44.375 --> 11:46.041
for when he got busted
with my marijuana crop.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.500
Wait. Your marijuana?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.375
What do you think
I grow here?

11:50.375 --> 11:53.000
The kind.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.750
All that damn fool had to do
was drive the van to Florida.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.250
There wasn't even
any pressure.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.041
He didn't know I'd
stuffed it with pot.

12:00.041 --> 12:02.667
You let your own son
take the fall?

12:02.667 --> 12:04.792
You know what
Horse Renoir thinks?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.917
Horse Renoir thinks...
Ah!

12:10.000 --> 12:11.458
What have I done!

12:11.458 --> 12:13.625
Jeff was telling the truth.
He's innocent.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.834
And now his own dad

12:14.834 --> 12:16.917
is gonna screw him over
and take him to jail.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.166
I have to pee now.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.166
Whenever I get tied up,
I have to pee.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.250
I'll try and hold it, but...

12:22.250 --> 12:24.959
I'm going now.
I'm sorry.

12:26.125 --> 12:30.166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.083
Jeff's dad probably has him

12:36.083 --> 12:37.834
halfway to Florida by now.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.000
I got an idea.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.333
I saw this in a movie once.
Hop with me.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.542
That's good.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.500
Why did you do that?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.417
Well, you weren't gonna do
anything from a movie.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.000
Um, uh...

12:55.000 --> 12:57.750
Come on, Steve. You're our
only hope to save Jeff.

12:57.750 --> 13:01.250
No problem. I'll just, uh,
touch the battery.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.709
Steve,
nothing happened.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.417
I feel funny.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.250
It must be
the smoke inhalation.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.542
It's killing my eyes.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.291
Ah, you know what
I meant to ask you?

13:24.291 --> 13:25.917
How did we get
out of there?

13:25.917 --> 13:28.041
I think we did
some sweet maneuvers

13:28.041 --> 13:29.542
from that movie Backdraft.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.667
I never saw Backdraft.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.667
Me either!

13:34.667 --> 13:37.041
We have to save Jeff.
There's not a moment to lose.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.959
Sorry. That's how I wake up.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.125
Florida?
We're in Florida?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.375
Oh, man,
I can't be in Florida!

14:04.375 --> 14:06.000
Relax, Son.
I know everything.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.250
We're gonna go down there

14:07.250 --> 14:08.583
and convince 'em
you're innocent.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.083
Really? But how?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.709
I'm your father.
Trust me.

14:21.750 --> 14:25.583
Stan, do you feel lighter?
I'm definitely getting lighter.

14:25.583 --> 14:28.083
I think I'm becoming
immune to gravity.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.875
Why is there a leopard
on the Cheetos bag?

14:32.458 --> 14:35.208
Wait. It's a cheetah.

14:36.083 --> 14:40.000
Cheetah.
Cheetos.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.166
There's so much beauty
in the world.

14:43.709 --> 14:46.333
Why do my wrists hurt?

14:46.333 --> 14:48.375
'Cause you're lying on them.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.792
How can you hear
what I'm thinking?

14:52.417 --> 14:53.792
Do you live here?

14:53.792 --> 14:56.917
'Cause I could live here.
This place is great.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.875
Hey, look. Someone picked out
all my favorite stuff.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.875
-That'll be--
-And this.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.041
Cat food?

15:03.041 --> 15:05.333
If I hold this,
I won't float away.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.375
That'll be $147.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.792
Where are...

15:09.792 --> 15:12.500
Where are we
gonna get that type of cash?

15:12.500 --> 15:15.417
-We can turn in Jeff.
-I thought Jeff was innocent.

15:15.417 --> 15:16.917
We gotta save Jeff!

15:19.333 --> 15:21.542
He's had quite a shock,
but he'll be fine.

15:21.542 --> 15:25.083
-Oh, thank God.
-Wait! I know where they are.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.750
-Steve, what are you
talking about?
-Your keys.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.000
I... I see them.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.625
-Honey, you're delirious.
-No, ma'am. Let the boy talk.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.709
That shock really
changed him.

15:35.709 --> 15:38.000
I sensed something
when I was working on him.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.542
Something strong enough

15:39.542 --> 15:42.458
to punch a hole from the next
world clear into this one.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.417
They're on a Gumby
key chain.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.917
Well, yeah, Steve.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.834
You gave me that
for my birthday.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.667
He's got the gift.

15:49.667 --> 15:54.291
Lead us to the keys, boy.
Lead us... to the keys.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.625
Man, what's with
all this traffic?

16:00.625 --> 16:02.333
We're never gonna
get Jeff in time.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.083
Is this right?

16:11.458 --> 16:13.417
Oh, it's a checkpoint.

16:13.417 --> 16:14.917
These are... These
are a good thing.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.542
Keeps people
from hurting each other.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.166
It's all about kindness
and music.

16:25.834 --> 16:28.875

16:38.333 --> 16:40.458
Night Ranger, man.

16:40.458 --> 16:44.083
-Night Ranger.
-"Night Ranger"?

16:51.667 --> 16:54.792
Oh, my God!
We're high! Of course.

16:54.792 --> 16:56.250
When the barn burned,

16:56.250 --> 16:58.750
we became pawns in marijuana's
mellow chess game.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.375
Oh, my God.
We gotta get outta here!

17:00.375 --> 17:02.583
I can't just abandon Jeff.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.083
Screw him! He's a loser.
You don't care about him.

17:05.083 --> 17:09.083
That's just it, Roger.
I... I kind of... do care.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.041
-That's just the weed talking.
-No, no.

17:12.041 --> 17:14.291
I... I cared before that.

17:14.291 --> 17:15.792
He's so upbeat and friendly,

17:15.792 --> 17:18.125
even though he has
such a terrible father.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.125
You know, I had
a crappy dad, too.

17:20.125 --> 17:23.667
I guess in a way, Jeff
and I are... kindred spirits.

17:28.208 --> 17:31.208
Did you... Did you see
that? The Indian?

17:31.208 --> 17:33.291
Who, Kevin?
Of course I saw him.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.625
We picked him up at
the rest stop an hour ago.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.667
Dropped my Rolos.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.125
Stan, think about this.
You're a federal agent.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.333
You get caught high,
you lose everything.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.125
Jeff's never had anyone
looking out for him.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.375
And I'm not gonna
let him down.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.875
Good evening, sir.
Have you been drinking?

17:49.875 --> 17:52.625
Evening.
Even-ing.

17:53.542 --> 17:55.083
Making things even.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.583
Please step out
of the car, sir.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.166
-He knows!
-Hang on!

18:04.667 --> 18:07.667
Find the keys, Steve.
Take us to the keys.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.917
Here.
They're in here.

18:14.166 --> 18:15.667
Nope. Nothing here

18:15.667 --> 18:18.208
but a busted water pipe
and a bunch of wires.

18:18.208 --> 18:20.792
Steve, for the last time,
you're not psychic!

18:20.792 --> 18:22.291
You'll get a lot of that.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.333
People are afraid
of the gift.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.375
Afraid of what
they don't understand.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.166
Please stop
encouraging him!

18:28.166 --> 18:31.583
Wait. This can't be.
They have to be there.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.083
It's gone.
The gift is gone.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.750
Or was it a curse?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.834
-You can't see no more keys?
-No.

18:40.834 --> 18:42.166
Well, good-bye.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.667
Slow down, Stan.
I can't keep up.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.458
Then drop the damn cat food!

18:55.458 --> 18:57.667
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.250
I float away and you get

18:59.250 --> 19:02.333
a bag of food scientifically
formulated for aging cats.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.291
Too late, Mr. Smith.

19:05.291 --> 19:07.750
My dad's in there right now
clearing my name.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.083
No, he's not, Jeff.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.875
He's turning you in
to get the money.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.583
Freeze! Hands in the air!

19:17.166 --> 19:18.750
You're wrong about my dad.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.583
He cares more about me
than anything.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.083
There's your criminal.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.834
Just give me the money.
That's all I care about, money.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.625
-Not Jeff. Money.
-See?

19:28.625 --> 19:31.750
Wait. Am I Jeff or money?

19:31.750 --> 19:33.500
Oh, man, I'm Jeff.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.750
-Dad!
-You're under arrest.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.417
Wait. This man-hippie
is innocent.

19:39.417 --> 19:42.083
His father planted drugs
on him without him knowing.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.208
He has no proof.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.208
I've got his confession
on tape.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.667
I was wearing a wire.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.083
Why were you
wearing a wire?

19:48.083 --> 19:50.041
I always wear a wire.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.750
That's why you shave
your chest.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.834
Oh, Hayley must wear
a muff wire.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.000
I knew I shouldn't have

19:57.000 --> 19:58.875
confessed to two people
I was gonna kill.

19:58.875 --> 20:01.542
-You were gonna kill 'em?
-Yeah, but you can't prove it,

20:01.542 --> 20:03.542
'cause you're not
wearing a wire.

20:03.542 --> 20:04.583
I'm a cop.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.208
Look, Jeff, I...

20:09.208 --> 20:11.291
I know what it's like
to have a lousy dad.

20:11.291 --> 20:16.333
But the fact is, none of us
get to choose our fathers.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.041
No, go on. I have a lot
of father issues, too.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.875
None of us get
to choose our fathers,

20:22.875 --> 20:25.875
but we do get to choose
our father figures.

20:25.875 --> 20:29.208
I chose my mother.
That set me back a bit.

20:29.208 --> 20:32.417
Then I realized I could
be my own father figure.

20:32.417 --> 20:35.917
Well, there is someone
I kind of look up to.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.917
Someone I've learned
to respect and admire.

20:38.917 --> 20:41.250
And I think he'd make
a great father figure--

20:41.250 --> 20:43.792
-Well, Jeff, I'm flattered--
-My Uncle Frank.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.709
What?
Oh. Uh, of course.

20:45.709 --> 20:49.083
-Oh, did you think
I meant--
-No, no.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.417
Mmm, this is awkward.
I'm gonna go.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.625
No, don't go.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.041
Why would it be awkward?
It's not awkward.

20:56.375 --> 21:00.583
So, we should get goin'.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.667
Wait. Are you too stoned
to drive?

21:02.667 --> 21:04.000
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.500
I'm pretty sure it's
all out of my system.

21:10.166 --> 21:11.417
Dude.
