WEBVTT

00:08.533 --> 00:10.867
AN ANTIQUE COOKIE JAR?

00:10.900 --> 00:13.467
OH, JENNY, YOU ARE
THE BEST SISTER EVER.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.500
OOH, IT'S A WATERSTONE.

00:15.533 --> 00:17.933
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!

00:20.267 --> 00:21.633
- HEY, LOUIE.
WANT TO HANG OUT?

00:21.667 --> 00:23.867
I HAVE A NEW INVENTION
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.467
- NO CAN DO, FRANKZILLA.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.900
TODAY'S THE DAY TEDDY MONROE
IS COMING OVER.

00:30.567 --> 00:32.633
TEDDY.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.533
THE COOLEST GHOST
IN MY SCHOOL.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.767
WE'RE GONNA PLAY THE ULTIMATE
GHOST FANTASY CARD GAME--

00:37.800 --> 00:41.800
GHOULTOPIA.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.633
- THAT GAME SOUNDS LAME.

00:43.667 --> 00:46.433
- YOU'RE LAME!

00:46.467 --> 00:48.533
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

00:48.567 --> 00:53.267
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM
GETTING MY COOL ON.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.467
A DOLPHIN?

00:57.833 --> 01:01.267
DON'T SAY A WORD.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.600
- OH, TAYLOR.
WANNA SEE MY NEW INVENTION?

01:09.633 --> 01:11.400
- CAN'T TODAY.
I'M TUTORING SOMEONE.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.800
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE
TO ME.

01:12.833 --> 01:15.533
YOU COULD'VE JUST SAID NO.

01:15.567 --> 01:16.800
- I'M SERIOUS.

01:16.833 --> 01:18.333
I'M TUTORING
THIS SUPER CUTE GUY TODD

01:18.367 --> 01:19.533
IN FRENCH.

01:19.567 --> 01:21.333
- BUT YOU DON'T SPEAK FRENCH.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.133
- NEITHER DOES HE,
SO HE'LL NEVER KNOW.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.433
BRILLIANT, NON?

01:24.467 --> 01:28.200
- NON.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.367
MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER.
I'M BORED.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.800
- FRANKIE, FRANKIE, FRANKIE.
I'M WORKING.

01:33.833 --> 01:35.667
- BUT I HAVE NO ONE
TO PLAY WITH.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.200
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.600
- COME ON.
MILES IS COOL.

01:44.633 --> 01:46.133
- LADIES, CHECK IT OUT.

01:46.167 --> 01:50.667
IT'S DWAYNE "THE SOCK" JOHNSON.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.433
"SORRY, LIEUTENANT,

01:52.467 --> 01:55.233
"BUT I CAN'T LET THOSE LOWLIFES
BLOW UP A FACTORY.

01:55.267 --> 01:58.767
THIS CHRISTMAS, THE CHILDREN
GET THEIR BOWTIES."

02:00.833 --> 02:04.700
COOL.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.633
SO, MILES, FRANKIE HERE
IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

02:06.667 --> 02:08.633
TO PLAY WITH.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.600
- "12 YEARS ON THE BEAT,
AND THEY HAND ME A ROOKIE.

02:11.633 --> 02:14.200
GRAB SOME CUSHION."

02:14.233 --> 02:16.533
- SORRY, DETECTIVE,
BUT YOU'RE CALLING IN SICK.

02:16.567 --> 02:20.733
I'VE GOT OTHER PLANS.

02:20.767 --> 02:23.900
I CALL IT...

02:23.933 --> 02:27.633
THE CAKE-A-PULT.

02:27.667 --> 02:30.667
OBSERVE.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.400
YES!

02:34.433 --> 02:37.267
- FRANKIE, THAT'S DANGEROUS.

02:37.300 --> 02:40.767
AND OFFENSIVE TO CLOWNS!

02:40.800 --> 02:42.400
I WANT NO PART OF IT.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.767
- I KNEW YOU WERE NO FUN.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.367
EXCUSE ME?

02:46.400 --> 02:50.133
I'M A HOOT!

02:50.167 --> 02:51.733
LET'S SEE.

02:51.767 --> 02:54.833
DO I NEED SAFETY GOGGLES?

02:54.867 --> 02:57.433
- NO.
LAUNCH THE BAGEL.

03:08.267 --> 03:10.900
- MOM'S COOKIE JAR!

03:20.233 --> 03:21.500
- NOT YET.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.200
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

03:30.233 --> 03:32.867
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

03:32.900 --> 03:35.167
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

03:35.200 --> 03:39.133
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

03:39.167 --> 03:41.367
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

03:41.400 --> 03:42.800
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

03:42.833 --> 03:45.667
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:45.700 --> 03:48.533
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:48.567 --> 03:50.600
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:50.633 --> 03:54.367
*

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:56.433 --> 03:58.600
*

04:03.567 --> 04:06.467
THIS IS BAD.
THIS IS SO BAD.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.500
- MILES, YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

04:09.533 --> 04:10.967
- MICHELLE LOVED
THAT ANTIQUE JAR.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.867
IT'S A WATERSTONE.
A WATERSTONE!

04:13.900 --> 04:16.333
WHAT'S A WATERSTONE?

04:16.367 --> 04:19.367
- RELAX.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.333
- CONFESS TO MICHELLE.
- COVER UP THE CRIME.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.667
WE CAN'T DO THAT!

04:23.700 --> 04:25.400
- MY CAKE-A-PULT,
YOUR BAGEL.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.067
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.067
HERE SHE COMES!

04:29.067 --> 04:32.300
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

04:37.367 --> 04:39.433
- HE'S FINE,
AREN'T YOU, MILES?

04:39.467 --> 04:43.800
- YES! FINE!
EVERYTHING'S FINE!

04:43.833 --> 04:45.400
- SO I NEED TO RUN
A FEW ERRANDS,

04:45.433 --> 04:46.833
PICK UP A NICE THANK-YOU CARD
FOR AUNT JENNY.

04:46.867 --> 04:49.367
BACK IN A BIT.
- OKEYDOKEY.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.833
YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.867
- OH.
MY LITTLE ANGEL.

04:57.567 --> 04:59.667
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.633
I LIED TO MICHELLE!

05:01.667 --> 05:05.533
EVEN MY SOCK PUPPET
WON'T LOOK AT ME.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.633
- MILES, IF MOM FINDS OUT
ABOUT HER COOKIE JAR,

05:07.667 --> 05:10.067
SHE'S GONNA GROUND US
FOR A MONTH.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.533
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

05:11.567 --> 05:13.300
BUT I CAN'T DO
THAT KIND OF TIME.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.567
- FINE.
WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

05:15.600 --> 05:17.467
- WE PUT THIS BABY
BACK TOGETHER.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.767
I'VE GOT GLUE
THAT CAN REPAIR ANYTHING.

05:19.800 --> 05:23.800
- EVEN THE TATTERED REPUTATION
OF A ONCE

05:23.833 --> 05:26.833
- DOUBT IT,
BUT I'LL CHECK THE LABEL.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.300
- DEAD FLOWERS,
CREEPY SKULLS,

05:35.333 --> 05:36.767
FRESH SPIDER WEBS?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.967
ARE YOU EXPECTING COMPANY?

05:39.067 --> 05:40.400
- SURE AM.

05:40.433 --> 05:42.333
TEDDY'LL BE HERE
ANY SECOND.

05:42.367 --> 05:44.800
DUDE'S A MASTER
GHOULTOPIA PLAYER.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.367
I'VE HAD THIS PLAY DATE
ON THE BOOKS FOR WEEKS.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.800
AND TODAY, I WOW HIM
WITH MY COOL FACTOR.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.200
- SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

05:53.233 --> 05:54.833
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE MY SON.

05:56.433 --> 06:00.633
- DAD, YOU GOT TOILET PAPER
ON YOUR SHOE.

06:00.667 --> 06:04.067
- AND I'M TOTALLY
MAKING IT WORK.

06:04.067 --> 06:05.467
AGH, AGH!

06:05.500 --> 06:07.367
- POW!
- AAH!

06:09.933 --> 06:11.700
OH, MAN, YOU ARE GOOD.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.900
- I DO WHAT I DO.

06:13.933 --> 06:16.067
LIKE THE CREEPY DIGS,
PRESTON.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.767
GOT YOUR GHOULTOPIA CARDS?

06:17.800 --> 06:21.367
'CAUSE I AM READY
TO TAKE YOU DOWN!

06:21.400 --> 06:23.467
- RAY, YOU KNOW FRENCH,
RIGHT?

06:23.500 --> 06:26.467
OH, SORRY, DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND OVER.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.933
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?
- NOT HERE.

06:28.967 --> 06:32.367
GO AWAY.
BOO!

06:32.400 --> 06:35.067
- SORRY, MR. CRANKY PANTS.

06:35.067 --> 06:37.633
OOH, A BERET!
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S FRENCH.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.233
I'M TOTALLY BORROWING IT.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.833
- SORRY ABOUT THAT
ANNOYANCE, TEDDY.

06:41.867 --> 06:43.467
THAT WAS JUST--

06:43.500 --> 06:45.700
- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.500
TAYLOR?

06:50.533 --> 06:52.633
- TAYLOR.

06:54.433 --> 06:56.700
TEDDY.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.833
OH, YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.600
- MILES.

07:03.633 --> 07:06.300
PREPARE TO BE WOWED.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.900
- AGH!

07:07.933 --> 07:10.800
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
MOM WILL NOTICE?

07:10.833 --> 07:13.300
- ONLY IF SHE HAS EYEBALLS.

07:13.333 --> 07:17.067
- WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS
PLAN "B."

07:17.067 --> 07:19.633
REMOVE HER EYEBALLS.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.700
- NO! NO MORE PLANS.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.900
THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO
IS BEG FOR FORGIVENESS

07:23.933 --> 07:27.967
AND SOMEHOW TRY AND REBUILD
OUR LIVES.

07:28.067 --> 07:31.067
- OR WE CAN GO OUT AND BUY
THE EXACT SAME JAR

07:31.067 --> 07:32.667
AND REPLACE IT.

07:34.067 --> 07:36.367
WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WE GONNA
FIND AN EXACT--

07:36.400 --> 07:37.700
- 455 MERCER STREET.

07:37.733 --> 07:38.833
THE ADDRESS
OF THE LOCAL DEALER

07:38.867 --> 07:40.700
WHO CARRIES WATERSTONE JARS.

07:42.567 --> 07:44.967
- I'LL HANDLE THAT.
WHAT I NEED IS TIME.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.467
- AAH!
SHE'S COMING BACK.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.600
I'M LITERALLY GOING
TO PASS OUT.

07:50.633 --> 07:52.667
- JUST CREATE THE GHOST ILLUSION
OF THE JAR.

07:52.700 --> 07:53.967
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REST.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.400
- IF SHE TRIES TO TOUCH IT,

07:55.433 --> 07:56.767
HER HAND WILL GO
RIGHT THROUGH.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.667
- JUST DO IT!
- NO! THIS MADNESS MUST END!

07:58.700 --> 08:00.867
- YOU SICKEN ME!

08:00.900 --> 08:02.700
- HEY, YOU.
- HELLO.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.400
- HEY!

08:04.433 --> 08:06.367
I JUST BOUGHT
THE BEST THANK-YOU CARD

08:06.400 --> 08:07.567
FOR MY SIS.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.300
IT PLAYS MUSIC
WHEN YOU OPEN IT.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.267
- MOM. MOM!

08:15.300 --> 08:17.467
AUNT JENNY HATES
THOSE MUSICAL CARDS.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.367
SHE TOLD ME.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.800
- HMM. WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD
GO GET ANOTHER

08:21.833 --> 08:25.533
AND KEEP THIS FUNKY JAM
FOR MYSELF.

08:25.567 --> 08:26.967
- BEFORE YOU GO,

08:27.067 --> 08:29.067
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING
TO THE MOVIES

08:29.067 --> 08:30.533
AND NEED SOME MONEY.

08:30.567 --> 08:31.900
- OH.
- 40 BUCKS SHOULD DO IT.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.567
- OOF, THAT'S A LITTLE PRICEY.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.867
WHAT MOVIE
ARE YOU GOING TO?

08:34.900 --> 08:37.500
- UH, THAT NEW THRILLER,

08:37.533 --> 08:40.667
WHY MUST CHILDREN LIE?

08:40.700 --> 08:44.267
- NO, WE'RE SEEING
SHUT UP AND DON'T BE A TWIT.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.467
IT'S MUCH BETTER.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.267
- OH.
WELL, YOU TWO HAVE FUN.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.300
TWO LIES IN ONE DAY.

08:56.333 --> 08:59.433
I'M OUT OF CONTROL!

08:59.467 --> 09:01.567
- IT GETS EASIER, MAN.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.600
IT GETS EASIER.

09:06.933 --> 09:08.333
- OH, GOOD, RAY.

09:08.367 --> 09:09.633
CAN YOU HELP ME
LEARN FRENCH

09:09.667 --> 09:12.500
BEFORE MY STUDENT
GETS HERE?

09:12.533 --> 09:14.733
- YOU DON'T KNOW FRENCH,
AND YOU'RE TEACHING IT?

09:14.767 --> 09:18.933
- WHY IS EVERYONE
SO HUNG UP ON THAT?

09:20.900 --> 09:22.667
THE GAME WAS JUST
GETTING STARTED.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.533
- WOULD YOU SAY HER HAIR
IS BROWN MOCHA

09:25.567 --> 09:28.433
OR WARM CHESTNUT?

09:31.767 --> 09:33.800
- TEDDY MONROE
IS THE SCARIEST,

09:33.833 --> 09:36.067
MOST FEARED GHOST
IN SCHOOL.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.067
- LOOKS LIKE TEDDY
HAS A MAJOR CASE

09:38.067 --> 09:39.967
OF THE TAYLORS.

09:40.067 --> 09:41.800
- WHAT DOES HE SEE
IN TAYLOR?

09:41.833 --> 09:44.833
THE GIRL CAN'T EVEN REMOVE
HER OWN HEAD.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.400
- HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU

09:52.433 --> 09:55.633
YOU HAVE EYES?

09:55.667 --> 09:57.800
- I SORT OF KNEW THAT.

09:57.833 --> 10:01.867
- UH, TAYLOR'S VERY BUSY
AND CAN'T BE DISTURBED.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.600
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, TAYLOR?

10:03.633 --> 10:05.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:05.433 --> 10:08.400
I'M JUST HANGING OUT UNTIL
MY "ESTUDIANT ARRIVOS"?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.433
- SPANISH.
- TOOK A SHOT.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.900
EVEN YOUR COUGH IS GORGEOUS.

10:14.933 --> 10:17.800
SOUNDS LIKE TAY-TAY
NEEDS SOME WA-WA.

10:17.833 --> 10:20.800
BE RIGHT BACK.

10:22.933 --> 10:26.033
- THAT WAS MY ENTIRE DAY
OF FUN

10:26.067 --> 10:29.500
BEING RUINED BECAUSE OF YOU!

10:31.567 --> 10:33.933
- YOU WERE PRETTY!

10:33.967 --> 10:36.833
- AWW, THAT'S SO SWEET.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.333
AWFUL. JUST AWFUL.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.833
DARN MY INCREDIBLE BEAUTY.

10:41.867 --> 10:43.967
- I SAID PRETTY.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.600
OUT ON THE MEAN STREETS,

10:51.633 --> 10:54.633
ON THE RUN
FROM JOHNNY LAW.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.200
- LOOK!

10:59.233 --> 11:03.800
- IT'S IDENTICAL.
LET'S BUY THAT ONE.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.267
HELLO.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.067
WHAT A NICE PLACE
YOU GOT HERE.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.933
GOOD FOR YOU.

11:13.567 --> 11:16.267
A NINE-YEAR-OLD HAS VALIDATED
MY LIFE CHOICES.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.267
WHEE.

11:19.933 --> 11:21.600
OH, I ONLY HAVE 40.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.467
DO YOU HAVE
A CUTE KIDS DISCOUNT?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.067
- YES.

11:29.067 --> 11:31.467
MILES, I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO HAGGLE.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.300
JUMP INTO CAPTAIN SMILES
AND POSSESS HIM

11:33.333 --> 11:35.733
SO I CAN BUY THAT JAR
FOR 40 BUCKS.

11:35.767 --> 11:37.933
- POSSESS SOMEONE
AGAINST THEIR WILL?

11:37.967 --> 11:39.300
- YES, OR I'M GOING TO PIN

11:39.333 --> 11:40.833
THIS WHOLE BROKEN JAR THING
ON YOU.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.833
- NO, I'M THREATENING
TO PUT THIS ALL ON YOU

11:44.867 --> 11:46.700
IF YOU DON'T DO
WHAT I SAY.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.300
- THAT'S BLACKMAIL.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.700
- OH. THEN YEAH!

11:51.733 --> 11:53.333
OKAY, FINE.

11:53.367 --> 11:57.667
BUT THIS IS IT.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.333
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.
- GREAT.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.833
HELLO, KIND SIR.

12:01.867 --> 12:06.067
HERE IS 40 DOLLARS
FOR THIS LOVELY JAR.

12:06.067 --> 12:09.400
- GREAT, I'LL JUST WRAP IT
UP FOR YOU.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.967
THIS REALLY IS
AN AMAZING PIECE.

12:12.067 --> 12:15.633
- SHE'S A BEAUT.
TAG HER AND BAG HER.

12:15.667 --> 12:18.300
- LOOK AT THE INTRICATE DETAILS
OF THESE LOTUS LEAVES.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.667
IT'S MAGNIFICENT.

12:19.700 --> 12:23.633
SORRY, 100 BUCKS.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

12:26.433 --> 12:30.067
- THIS SHOP OWNER
IS INSANE!

12:30.067 --> 12:31.767
I MEAN ME.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.533
I'M CRAZY.
WHOO!

12:35.567 --> 12:38.500
- MAY I SEE YOU
FOR A SECOND?

12:40.633 --> 12:42.933
DO YOU MIND EXPLAINING TO ME
WHAT THAT WAS?

12:42.967 --> 12:47.567
- UM, BEING A RESPONSIBLE
BUSINESS OWNER.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.567
- UGH, AND NOW THAT GUY'S BUYING
OUR COOKIE JAR.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.733
OH, NO! OUR JAR!

12:53.767 --> 12:56.967
THIS TIME...
IT'S THE REAL DEAL.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.800
WE CAN'T LET HIM LEAVE.
LOCK THE DOOR.

13:05.833 --> 13:09.633
- HAVEN'T WE COMMITTED
ENOUGH FELONIES FOR ONE DAY?

13:09.667 --> 13:11.633
- DO IT!

13:13.233 --> 13:14.700
- I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

13:14.733 --> 13:16.767
WE HAVE TO GET HIM
BACK TO THE BAKERY

13:16.800 --> 13:20.867
AND AWAY FROM ALL THESE
SECURITY CAMERAS.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.967
- I'M NOT LIKING
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.067
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S ALL ON THE UP AND UP.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.233
ALL I NEED IS A PAIR
OF DARK GLASSES

13:28.267 --> 13:30.867
AND AN UNMARKED VAN.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.133
- WAIT.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.867
I THINK I'VE GOT
A LESS KIDNAP-Y WAY

13:33.900 --> 13:36.067
TO GET HIM THERE.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.933
- "FREE SLICE OF PIE
AT PIE SQUARED

13:41.967 --> 13:46.067
FOR ANYONE WEARING
AN UGLY GREEN SHIRT."

13:46.100 --> 13:47.300
CHA-CHING!

13:47.333 --> 13:50.867
MY LUCKY DAY!

13:53.400 --> 13:56.333
- ALL RIGHT, TIME TO GET
THIS DAY BACK ON TRACK.

13:56.367 --> 13:59.367
TEDDY, YOUR ROLL.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.333
THERE YOU GO!
DOUBLE SIXES.

14:05.367 --> 14:07.067
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

14:07.067 --> 14:08.700
- YEP.

14:08.733 --> 14:11.800
LOSE A TURN AND GO STRAIGHT
TO TAYLOR'S ROOM.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.267
LATERS!

14:15.667 --> 14:18.667
- THIS IS BECOMING TIRESOME.

14:22.933 --> 14:26.067
OH, COME ON!

14:27.833 --> 14:30.200
- IT'S OKAY.
THEY'RE NOT IN HERE.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.967
- RAY, I FEEL TERRIBLE.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.267
I MESSED UP
LOUIE'S ENTIRE DAY.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.700
DARN THESE GOOD LOOKS.

14:37.733 --> 14:39.300
- YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.700
- LITTLE BIT.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.667
- YOU KNOW,
THERE WAS THIS TIME

14:42.700 --> 14:45.100
WHEN I HAD TO DOWNPLAY...

14:45.133 --> 14:47.400
THIS.

14:47.433 --> 14:49.067
SO I USED
THIS GHOST ILLUSION

14:49.067 --> 14:51.400
TO MAKE MYSELF
AS REPULSIVE AS POSSIBLE.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.067
- THAT'S GENIUS.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.400
CAN YOU DO THAT TO ME?

14:54.433 --> 14:57.900
ARE YOU THAT POWERFUL?

14:57.933 --> 15:00.233
- I THINK I GOT IT.

15:07.067 --> 15:10.100
- OH, I'M GOOD.

15:10.133 --> 15:12.833
MAYBE TOO GOOD.
UGH!

15:12.867 --> 15:16.700
- LET'S SEE HOW TEDDY
LIKES ME NOW.

15:19.767 --> 15:23.067
- WHEN THE GUY GETS HERE,
I'LL HANDLE "NEGOTIATIONS."

15:23.067 --> 15:24.333
- YOU AIR-QUOTED THAT.

15:24.367 --> 15:25.967
WHY WOULD YOU
AIR

15:26.067 --> 15:29.767
HOW DEEP DOES
THIS RABBIT HOLE GO?

15:29.800 --> 15:31.100
- KEEP A LOOKOUT
FOR MY MOM.

15:31.133 --> 15:33.067
IF YOU SEE HER COMING,
GIVE ME A SIGNAL.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.933
- OKAY, I'LL YELL OUT
TYPES OF PUDDING.

15:35.967 --> 15:39.633
- OF COURSE YOU WILL.

15:39.667 --> 15:41.233
HELLO, SIR.

15:41.267 --> 15:44.900
WHAT A REPULSIVE SHIRT.

15:44.933 --> 15:47.333
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN OUR FLYER.
- SURE DID.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.200
HOW ABOUT A SLICE
OF APPLE?

15:49.233 --> 15:51.267
- OUR SPECIALTY.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.933
HEY, NICE JAR.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.267
- I KNOW.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.933
I'M GONNA USE IT
TO STORE ALL THE NOTES

15:56.967 --> 15:58.133
I GET FROM MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

15:58.167 --> 16:01.300
SHE CALLS ME PAPPY.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.067
- PERHAPS I COULD TRADE YOU
THAT JAR

16:06.100 --> 16:07.800
FOR, SAY, TWO WHOLE PIES?

16:07.833 --> 16:08.933
- MAKE IT TEN.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.300
- FIVE AND A PIE SQUARED
T-SHIRT.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.300
- DEAL.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.300
- I'LL JUST GO GET
THOSE PIES.

16:16.167 --> 16:17.733
- FRANKIE, THAT WAS AWESOME.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.867
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET
AWAY WITH THIS.

16:21.733 --> 16:22.900
whap!
- OW!

16:30.833 --> 16:32.333
- COME ON, TEDDY.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.900
LET'S FINISH OUR GAME.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.200
- HEY, GUYS.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.767
- YAHHH!

16:42.300 --> 16:43.733
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:45.067 --> 16:46.833
THIS IS THE REAL ME.

16:46.867 --> 16:50.833
EARLIER I WAS WEARING MAKEUP
AND FAKE TEETH.

16:50.867 --> 16:53.633
- YEP, THIS IS HOW WE SEE TAYLOR
EVERY DAY.

16:53.667 --> 16:57.700
WE EVEN SET EXTRA PLACES
AT THE TABLE FOR HER MOLES.

16:57.733 --> 17:01.800
- I CALL THIS ONE SUZIE.

17:01.833 --> 17:05.267
- TAYLOR, YOU LOOK...
DIFFERENT.

17:05.300 --> 17:08.333
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SHOWING ME
WHO YOU REALLY ARE

17:08.367 --> 17:11.300
MAKES YOU EVEN MORE
BEAUTIFUL.

17:13.667 --> 17:17.633
- ARE YOU SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING?

17:17.667 --> 17:20.767
- TAYLOR, YOU WANNA JOIN US
IN A FEW GAMES OF GHOULTOPIA?

17:22.433 --> 17:24.167
- SOME GHOST--

17:24.200 --> 17:26.767
TAYLOR, GHOULTOPIA
IS THE MOST POPULAR

17:26.800 --> 17:28.400
FANTASY CARD GAME AROUND.

17:28.433 --> 17:31.200
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:31.233 --> 17:32.800
SOUNDS STUPID.

17:32.833 --> 17:35.400
- YOU'RE STUPID!

17:35.433 --> 17:38.333
- WELL, I THINK IT'S A DUMB,

17:38.367 --> 17:40.733
DOPEY, BORING GAME!

17:40.767 --> 17:43.367
- LOUIE, PERHAPS
WE CAN GO TO THE ATTIC

17:43.400 --> 17:47.333
WHERE THERE'LL BE
FEWER ANNOYANCES.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.067
- IF YOU SAY SO.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.733
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT GIRL.

17:51.767 --> 17:53.267
- EH, SHE'S NOT SO BAD.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.067
THANK YOU!

18:04.300 --> 18:05.700
- I GOT NOTHIN'.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.467
- YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
SOMETHING.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.300
- MOM WILL BE BACK
ANY SECOND.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.933
I CAN EXPLAIN
A LOT OF THINGS,

18:10.967 --> 18:14.867
BUT I'M NOT THIS GOOD.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.300
HATE TO SAY IT, MILES,
BUT IT'S OVER.

18:18.733 --> 18:19.933
IF WE STOP,

18:19.967 --> 18:21.300
ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS
WE DID TODAY

18:21.333 --> 18:22.700
WERE FOR WHAT?

18:22.733 --> 18:25.167
NOTHING?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.867
- HMPH, I WANT BETTER
THAN OKAY.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.067
YOU MAY HAVE PLAYED
ALL YOUR CARDS, BABY DOLL...

18:31.067 --> 18:32.400
BABY DOLL?
- BUT ME,

18:32.433 --> 18:35.867
I'M STILL IN THE GAME.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.233
- YOO-HOO!

18:37.267 --> 18:40.700
- UH, BUTTERSCOTCH, VANILLA,
BANANA CREAM!

18:40.733 --> 18:42.633
- YOU DISTRACT MICHELLE.

18:42.667 --> 18:46.700
I'LL MOVE CHUCKLES HERE
WITH MY GHOST POWERS.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.133
NOW, WOMAN!

18:51.067 --> 18:52.400
HEY, MOM.
- OH.

18:52.433 --> 18:54.733
- WILL YOU TELL ME
A STORY?

18:54.767 --> 18:56.067
- OH, BUT I NEED TO--
- TELL ME ABOUT THE DAY

18:56.067 --> 18:57.233
I WAS BORN.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.733
DID I GRAB YOUR FINGER?

18:58.767 --> 19:00.267
- OH.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.100
IT WAS A MAGICAL MORNING...

19:04.067 --> 19:07.067
- OKAY,
WHERE CAN WE HIDE YOU?

19:11.900 --> 19:15.067
- SO THAT'S THE STORY
OF MY BIRTH.

19:15.067 --> 19:18.133
AND NOW WE ARE ENTERING
THE BAKERY.

19:21.867 --> 19:25.833
- IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL JOURNEY.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.367
- NICE WORK.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.100
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH HIM?

19:30.133 --> 19:33.200
YOU STUCK HIM
IN THE PASTRY CASE?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.467
- OH, WELCOME TO PIE SQUARED.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.933
FRANKIE, STEP ASIDE
SO SHE CAN SEE.

19:39.967 --> 19:41.333
F.Y.I.,
EVERYTHING IN THIS CASE

19:41.367 --> 19:43.067
IS BAKED FRESH DAILY.

19:43.067 --> 19:47.467
FRANKIE.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.733
- WHAT IS SHE
SCREAMING ABOUT?

20:01.233 --> 20:02.967
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:04.467 --> 20:07.733
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GET FREE PIE.

20:07.767 --> 20:10.800
AND A T-SHIRT!

20:10.833 --> 20:13.267
YOU PEOPLE ARE NUTS.

20:15.700 --> 20:19.767
IF YOU STILL WANT A T-SHIRT,
GO TO OUR WEBSITE!

20:19.800 --> 20:22.233
- WE DID IT.
WE PULLED IT OFF!

20:22.267 --> 20:24.933
- WE DID DO IT!
WHEW, WHAT A RUSH.

20:24.967 --> 20:28.133
I COULD GET USED
TO THIS BAD BOY LIFESTYLE.

20:28.167 --> 20:30.700
- I'M SORRY YOU TWO
HAD TO SEE THAT,

20:30.733 --> 20:32.033
BUT--BUT IT'S A GOOD LESSON.

20:32.067 --> 20:35.133
THERE ARE SOME CRAZY PEOPLE
OUT THERE.

20:37.167 --> 20:38.733
- HE WASN'T CRAZY.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.100
HE WAS PAPPY,
AN INNOCENT, LOVING GRANDDAD

20:41.133 --> 20:43.267
WHO WE CALLOUSLY USED
TO REPLACE A COOKIE JAR

20:43.300 --> 20:46.200
WE VICIOUSLY BROKE.

20:46.233 --> 20:49.800
- WAY TO GO, BAD BOY.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.400
- YOU TWO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS?

20:51.433 --> 20:52.867
- SORRY, MOM.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.333
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKED
THAT JAR.

20:54.367 --> 20:57.700
- YOU BOTH ARE SO GROUNDED.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.133
F.Y.I.,
I HATED THAT COOKIE JAR.

21:02.067 --> 21:04.800
- PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS BUYING ME
COOKIE JARS.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.433
"OH! SHE OWNS A BAKERY!

21:06.467 --> 21:08.700
IT'S A PERFECT GIFT!"

21:08.733 --> 21:10.833
I HAVE 500 OF THEM.

21:10.867 --> 21:13.733
WISH I'D OPENED
A JEWELRY STORE.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.667
SO GROUNDED.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.267
SORRY.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.900
I JUST COULDN'T KEEP LYING.

21:19.933 --> 21:22.367
- IT'S OKAY.
I STILL HAD FUN TODAY.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.400
- ME TOO.
- HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE

21:24.433 --> 21:26.400
A SLINGSHOT I MADE
OUT OF LICORICE?

21:26.433 --> 21:29.700
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.467
- TURNS OUT YOU DIDN'T NEED
ALL OF THIS.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.133
HE JUST NEEDED
TO TALK TO YOU.

21:38.167 --> 21:39.367
- I KNOW.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.967
NOW I GOT
LESS THAN TEN MINUTES

21:41.067 --> 21:42.167
TO LEARN FRENCH AND--

21:42.200 --> 21:43.367
- GAH!

21:43.400 --> 21:46.100
- TODD, YOU'RE EARLY!

21:46.133 --> 21:48.067
- I THINK I'LL LEARN
GERMAN INSTEAD.

21:48.067 --> 21:49.233
CLOSE!

21:49.267 --> 21:51.067
CLOSE, QUICKLY, CLOSE!

21:52.867 --> 21:55.233
- I LIKE THIS LOOK.
KEEPS THE BOYS AWAY.

21:56.467 --> 21:58.233
- RAY!
