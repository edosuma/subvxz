01:11.630 --> 01:13.590
Beth:
Josh, come down and eat.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.160
Fine.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.470
Yo. Eat up, buddy.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.480
- You do you're homework?
- Yep.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.960
Of course he did.
He always does.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.000
- Hey.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.660
Okay, keys.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.880
Keys.
Where are my keys?

01:38.880 --> 01:40.580
- Seriously?
- What?

01:40.580 --> 01:43.490
- You're ridiculous.
- See -- yeah.

01:43.490 --> 01:44.880
I was testing you.
- Hmm.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.450
- That was a test.
- Hmm.

01:46.450 --> 01:48.890
- You failed.
- Aw!

01:48.890 --> 01:50.410
And you -- thank you.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.590
Okay.

01:51.590 --> 01:53.810
I'm out. Knuckles.
Pound it.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.980
Boom. Nice.
Thank you.

01:55.980 --> 01:57.030
- 'Kay.
- Love you guys.

01:57.030 --> 01:58.380
- Bye, Dad.
- Come on.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.030
Hurry up.
They're gonna be here soon.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.130
Hey.
Hey.

02:10.389 --> 02:11.480
Hey, Daniel.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.830
Hey, Josh.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.570
Looks like you
finally gave in.

02:14.570 --> 02:17.870
Yeah. Well, it keeps him quiet
on the drive, at least.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.700
So are we still on for
girls' night next week?

02:19.700 --> 02:22.010
Anything to get away
from this little monster.

02:22.010 --> 02:23.140
Right? All right, hey.

02:23.140 --> 02:24.620
You guys be good
at school.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.060
- We know. Love you, Mom. Bye!
- All right, bye.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.360
Good luck with that.
All right. Bye.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.950
Teacher: I saw some of you guys
were answering the questions

02:47.950 --> 02:49.690
with numbers,
some had happy faces.

02:49.690 --> 02:51.080
I like all the answers,

02:51.080 --> 02:54.300
but how many muffins
are we gonna eat?

03:00.830 --> 03:02.660
Okay, go ahead.

03:43.870 --> 03:47.530
Hey. Sorry.

03:51.010 --> 03:52.660
Shh.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.710
Hear that?

03:57.630 --> 03:58.930
Hold on.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.150
Josh: What?

04:01.150 --> 04:02.940
Here, uh,
you can move your guy.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.810
Here.
I'll let you go first.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.160
Okay.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.550
Uh, then we set them
up in a line.

04:09.550 --> 04:13.550
And you're like, four --
four, five, or six each.

04:13.550 --> 04:16.470
Yeah, sure, but how many
do you want to put on first?

04:16.470 --> 04:18.170
Six?
Yeah, sure. Here.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.339
I'll have six, too.

04:20.339 --> 04:22.870
I think Josh has
an imaginary friend.

04:22.870 --> 04:26.650
Ah, that's cute.

04:26.650 --> 04:28.270
I guess.

04:31.010 --> 04:32.880
Okay, time for
your ni-nights.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.450
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

04:35.450 --> 04:37.270
And goodnight, Matchie.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.490
Mm. Anybody else?

04:39.490 --> 04:40.930
Goodnight, Chewie!

04:40.930 --> 04:42.410
Mm-hmm.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.500
Okay, give me a kiss.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.460
- Goodnight, Mom.
- Love you.

04:49.070 --> 04:50.550
You want it open or shut?

04:50.550 --> 04:53.460
- Open.
- Okay. Night.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.080
Bye, Mom!
Bye, honey.

05:08.610 --> 05:10.390
- Good morning.
- Seatbelts?

05:10.390 --> 05:12.530
- Yep.
- Okay.

05:12.530 --> 05:14.050
Thank you.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.770
Shit.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.950
Hey, Mom.

05:43.950 --> 05:45.780
How you feeling?

05:56.880 --> 05:59.620
Where's your sister?

05:59.620 --> 06:02.490
Uh, yeah, she should
be here soon.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.760
Can I get you anything?

06:13.590 --> 06:16.900
I saw your father.

06:16.900 --> 06:20.290
He looked just the same.

06:20.290 --> 06:23.640
He hadn't aged a day.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.170
I could smell his cologne.

07:02.770 --> 07:07.030
Ah.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.080
Is that for
your new friend?

07:14.080 --> 07:17.000
I don't think
we've formally met, Josh.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
What's your new friend's
name?

07:21.350 --> 07:22.830
Are you gonna tell us?

07:26.140 --> 07:28.840
He doesn't want me to.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.190
- Oh.
- Okay.

07:30.190 --> 07:32.010
Hmm.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.110
They want to know your name.

07:41.110 --> 07:44.110
Okay. Yeah.

07:44.110 --> 07:47.330
Okay, sounds good.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.270
"Z"?

08:06.270 --> 08:09.310
Yep.

08:09.310 --> 08:10.700
Nice to meet you, Z.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.750
He says,
"Nice to meet you, too."

08:12.750 --> 08:14.360
Oh, wow.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.880
He's very polite.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.590
Mom, no! The floor's hot lava!
Stop, stop, stop!

08:27.590 --> 08:30.330
The floor is hot lava.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.860
Only step on the rocks.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.030
Yeah, okay, good.
Come on.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.429
Let's go.
It's time for bed.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.640
No, no! You're melting!
You're melting!

08:36.640 --> 08:38.250
Aaaaah!

08:38.250 --> 08:39.780
No! No!

08:39.780 --> 08:41.909
Come on.
It's time to brush your teeth.

08:41.909 --> 08:44.220
Let's go.

08:44.220 --> 08:46.610
Come on, Z, let's go.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.920
Okay.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.050
Make one more move.
Just come on.

08:50.050 --> 08:52.920
Oh! Oh. Whoa, whoa.
This floor is hot.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.230
So, now -- ha!

08:56.230 --> 08:57.320
You're stuck, Z!

08:57.320 --> 08:59.880
Okay, Josh,
come on now.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.540
Fine.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.550
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

09:08.550 --> 09:10.240
Good night, Matchie.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.640
Good night, Chewie.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.730
Mm, sweetie, you sure you still
want to say good night to him?

09:17.730 --> 09:22.080
Just because he died
doesn't mean he can't hear me.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.870
Okay.
All right.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.610
Love you.Love you, too.

09:34.350 --> 09:36.880
Wait.
Close it.

09:39.660 --> 09:41.580
Are you sure?
Yeah.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.360
Z likes it dark.

09:50.370 --> 09:53.020
So, what are we gonna
do about this?

09:53.020 --> 09:54.420
About what?

09:54.420 --> 09:56.250
What do you think?

09:57.720 --> 10:00.810
What, his creepy
imaginary friend?

10:03.560 --> 10:04.950
I don't know.

10:04.950 --> 10:06.470
He'll grow out of it,
I guess.

10:08.950 --> 10:10.910
Yeah.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.180
Yeah, probably.

10:23.620 --> 10:24.930
Did Daniel say anything?

10:24.930 --> 10:26.670
That they weren't gonna
come today?

10:30.450 --> 10:32.370
Josh, did Daniel
say anything?

10:35.680 --> 10:37.850
Beth: All right,
have a good day.

10:37.850 --> 10:39.030
Love you.

11:49.490 --> 11:52.060
Hello?

11:52.060 --> 11:54.930
This is.

11:54.930 --> 11:57.240
This is never
an easy conversation to have.

11:59.060 --> 12:02.630
I just don't understand.
Suspended indefinitely?

12:02.630 --> 12:05.590
Listen, Josh is one
of my favorite students.

12:05.590 --> 12:07.900
Well, what did he do
exactly?

12:07.900 --> 12:10.030
I don't even know
where to start.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.690
Um, the language is
unacceptable,

12:12.690 --> 12:14.990
and now he's started
hitting his classmates.

12:14.990 --> 12:17.600
What? Hitting?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.820
This was all detailed in the
red cards I sent home with him.

12:20.820 --> 12:24.310
W-What red cards?

12:24.310 --> 12:27.180
This is your husband's signature
isn't it?

12:28.830 --> 12:30.490
Sorry, Beth.

12:30.490 --> 12:32.400
Until Josh can behave
in a classroom setting,

12:32.400 --> 12:35.710
I -- I just don't see
any other options.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.280
"Josh left class
without permission

12:43.280 --> 12:46.020
and refused to come back
when asked."

12:46.020 --> 12:47.760
"Josh was caught harassing
other students,

12:47.760 --> 12:50.070
both verbally
andphysically."

12:50.070 --> 12:52.600
"Josh has been using
vulgar language repeatedly,

12:52.600 --> 12:55.080
was asked to stop
but continued."

12:55.080 --> 12:56.340
Sh-- shall I keep going?

12:56.340 --> 13:00.120
Okay.
I'm sorry.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.000
It's just, kids get
into trouble sometimes.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.480
It's what they do.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.000
Well, our kid just got
suspended, Kevin,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.310
so great job.

13:07.310 --> 13:08.830
That's good parenting.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.350
And he refuses to take
responsibility for any of it.

13:10.350 --> 13:13.270
He blames all of it
on his new best friend.

13:13.270 --> 13:16.530
Okay.
So what do you want to do?

13:25.190 --> 13:27.590
Dr. Seager:
Having an imaginary friend

13:27.590 --> 13:31.460
can come from
several things --

13:31.460 --> 13:35.550
boredom, loneliness,
a need to establish boundaries,

13:35.550 --> 13:38.640
and sometimes means
acting out.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.080
So, does he need to be
on something?

13:42.080 --> 13:43.690
Beth.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.520
Jesus. Were not
medicating our kid.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.090
No, I don't think
that's necessary.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.610
A lot of children develop
imaginary friends,

13:51.610 --> 13:58.270
and oftentimes it can be
a positive experience.

13:58.270 --> 14:02.320
So, is there anything we can do
to help him be less...

14:02.320 --> 14:04.800
you know, destructive?

14:04.800 --> 14:10.190
Well, you could try playing
with him more at home.

14:10.190 --> 14:14.240
You could be there for him
like his friend is,

14:14.240 --> 14:15.460
help him see that
it's all right

14:15.460 --> 14:20.680
to be himself
around real people.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.290
Okay.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.170
So, that's it?

14:26.170 --> 14:27.860
I think so.

14:27.860 --> 14:32.430
I think he's a perfectly normal
8-year-old boy.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.920
Okay.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.660
Nice to see you again,
Beth,

14:37.660 --> 14:39.880
although I wish it was
under better circumstances.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.620
- Oh. Yeah.
- Josh, let's go.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.320
Come on, Z.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.490
Z?

14:46.490 --> 14:48.190
Yeah, that's what
he calls it.

14:48.190 --> 14:50.020
Listen,
thanks for everything.Uh, yeah.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.280
We'll follow up
in a couple days.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.630
- Of course.
- Okay.

14:52.630 --> 14:53.720
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.590
Okay. Hey, Josh.

15:00.810 --> 15:03.470
You know, you really gotta
go see Mom.

15:03.470 --> 15:08.380
She's --
she's looking rough.

15:08.380 --> 15:10.040
She keeps asking
about you.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.820
I know. I know.

15:11.820 --> 15:16.300
It's just, I can't see her
like that.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.480
It actually makes me
feel sorry for her.

15:21.270 --> 15:23.570
I don't think
that's possible.

15:26.180 --> 15:29.490
What has she been saying?

15:29.490 --> 15:32.930
She talks about Dad a lot.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.280
He's having fun.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.590
Wish I had a friend
like that.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.460
Ah, just make one up.
That's what he did.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.070
Hm.

15:58.690 --> 16:05.090
Kevin.

16:50.140 --> 16:55.230
Josh?

17:04.800 --> 17:06.500
Josh.
Hi, Mommy.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.369
Z doesn't want crust
on his sandwich.

17:09.369 --> 17:10.770
Okay, honey.

17:10.770 --> 17:12.200
Can you just give me that -- No!

17:12.200 --> 17:15.950
I have to finish.
He's hungry.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.900
Okay, why don't you
just give me the knife?

17:17.900 --> 17:19.950
Careful now.
Good boy.

17:19.950 --> 17:22.470
I'll tell you what -- we will
finish this in the morning.

17:22.470 --> 17:27.220
Okay? Right now,
let's just go back to bed.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.760
- Thanks.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.190
Is this for me?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.930
Ah.

17:50.890 --> 17:55.200
So, what are you two
getting up to today?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.120
- We're going to Play Zone!

17:57.120 --> 18:00.770
Hey, you show your mom
a good time, little dude.

18:00.770 --> 18:03.780
And you, remember --

18:03.780 --> 18:06.780
just be the friend
he needs.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.830
All right, I gotta run.
I love you guys.

18:11.830 --> 18:15.130
Knuckles.
All right.

18:23.010 --> 18:24.620
Yeah! Yeah!

18:24.620 --> 18:27.410
Oh!

18:27.410 --> 18:28.800
I'm gonna get you!

18:28.800 --> 18:31.150
- Whoo!

18:31.150 --> 18:32.800
Ha, ha, ha!
I won!

18:32.800 --> 18:35.330
You lo-o-o-o-ost!
Now, come on.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.500
Let's go on the big slide.
Big slide, big slide.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.940
- No. No.
- Yes!

18:37.940 --> 18:39.250
- I don't like the big slide.
- Yes, yes!

18:39.250 --> 18:41.030
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.No, I don't like it.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.550
Oh.

18:42.550 --> 18:45.380
Oh, my God.

18:55.310 --> 18:57.180
Hey, Mom, look at me!

18:58.180 --> 19:00.440
Come on.
Come play.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.710
- Josh?
- Help me!

19:12.670 --> 19:15.460
Josh!

19:15.460 --> 19:17.410
Ah! Josh!

19:17.410 --> 19:20.550
Okay, okay.
Josh!

19:20.550 --> 19:22.810
Ha, ha, ha!

19:22.810 --> 19:24.860
I got you! I got you!
I got you!

19:24.860 --> 19:27.860
Oh, my God! You should have seen
the look on your face!

19:27.860 --> 19:29.470
It was classic.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.960
Mom!
Yeah.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.180
Can you get me and Z
some milk?

19:42.180 --> 19:44.350
Sure.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.050
Oh, hey.
How was Play Zone?

19:47.050 --> 19:50.010
It was awesome. Yeah?

19:50.010 --> 19:53.150
But she was way too scared
to go on the big slide.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.150
Every time.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.410
Wait!
Grab the 2 %.

20:00.410 --> 20:02.330
Let me tell you a secret.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.070
You tell her you're going
on the small slide.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.070
You sneak around
to the big line-up.

20:06.070 --> 20:07.900
She never has a clue.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.290
Hey, you think Z
would mind

20:09.290 --> 20:11.210
if I have a piece
of his garlic toast?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.770
Thanks, Z!

20:12.770 --> 20:16.690
Ugh.
Kevin, don't, please,

20:16.690 --> 20:18.300
talk to it
like it's real.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.660
Give me your glass.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.660
Thank you.Here you go, bud.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.290
Hey.
Hey.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.770
What's on your mind?

20:52.770 --> 20:56.990
Is it a certain letter,
perhaps the last one?

21:06.960 --> 21:10.660
Something happened.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.790
What do you mean?

21:14.790 --> 21:17.710
So, Josh was playing
at Play Zone and, uh...

21:20.670 --> 21:24.450
It was like for a second...

21:25.930 --> 21:31.200
...I -- I saw --
I saw it.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.860
I -- I saw Z.

21:39.160 --> 21:43.870
God, I wasn't gonna
say anything.

21:43.870 --> 21:47.390
But a couple nights ago
when I was heading up to bed,

21:47.390 --> 21:52.610
I swear I saw something standing
in the corner watching me.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.270
You know, at first
I second-guessed it.

21:56.270 --> 21:58.880
I -- I closed my eyes,

21:58.880 --> 22:00.620
and I told myself
it wasn't there.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.370
But it was, Beth.

22:06.370 --> 22:07.930
Something was there.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.550
Really?

22:15.770 --> 22:18.940
No, it was my jacket.

22:18.940 --> 22:20.770
Z isn't real.

22:20.770 --> 22:23.990
Grow up.

22:23.990 --> 22:25.300
Thanks.

22:25.300 --> 22:29.610
Look, it's our kid's
imaginary friend.

22:29.610 --> 22:31.390
Oh, Jesus Christ.

22:42.530 --> 22:45.360
Josh: Cheer up.
Okay.

22:47.280 --> 22:50.190
Uh, I like baseball.

22:50.190 --> 22:53.540
Mm-hmm.
Mostly center field.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.370
Oh, yeah,
that's for sure.

22:55.370 --> 22:57.110
Ah, there's a crazy tiger!

22:57.110 --> 23:00.770
Yeah, or is this a leopard
or cheetah?

23:41.980 --> 23:44.900
What does
she look like?

23:44.900 --> 23:47.340
Eh, the same,
just deader.

23:55.650 --> 23:57.560
Oh, shit.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.130
You should go up there.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.960
Dead bodies
freak me out.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.490
Yeah.

24:07.970 --> 24:09.620
She's our mom.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.060
Yeah.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.870
Mechanical voice: Z.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.320
Z.

25:03.540 --> 25:05.590
Z.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.350
Z.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.660
Z.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.810
Hmm.
Hey.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.860
I couldn't do it.
Let's go.

26:07.430 --> 26:10.260
Hey, Anne, it's Beth,
Josh's mom.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.180
Yeah, hey, listen,
I -- I just was wondering

26:12.180 --> 26:16.570
if maybe Josh could have a play
date with Thomas this afternoon?

26:16.570 --> 26:18.970
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

26:18.970 --> 26:21.970
No, we can -- we can
just do it another time.

26:21.970 --> 26:24.450
All right, thanks.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.230
Hey, yeah.
I -- I just --

26:26.230 --> 26:28.500
I haven't seen you guys since --
since Brittany's birthday,

26:28.500 --> 26:30.760
and, uh, I just thought
maybe Josh could come over

26:30.760 --> 26:32.150
and have a play date with her.

26:32.150 --> 26:36.200
Hi. It's Josh's mom.
Listen, I was --

26:36.200 --> 26:37.900
Wow.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.340
Hello?

26:52.040 --> 26:53.480
Georgia:
So, how is everything?

26:53.480 --> 26:55.700
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.480
I'm sure you heard
Josh got suspended.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.180
Where's Daniel?

27:02.180 --> 27:05.100
Uh, he's upstairs,

27:05.100 --> 27:07.190
but I think he might be
taking a nap, and --

27:11.580 --> 27:13.240
It's like my son's
one of those children

27:13.240 --> 27:15.280
of the cornfield
or whatever.

27:15.280 --> 27:18.020
Of course not.

27:18.020 --> 27:21.510
I'm sorry about...
you know.

27:21.510 --> 27:23.680
Ghosting me?

27:23.680 --> 27:25.250
Yeah, that.

27:29.470 --> 27:31.340
He's a good kid,
you know?

27:31.340 --> 27:33.690
He's just got a really --
I don't know,

27:33.690 --> 27:36.000
a vivid imagination
right now.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.830
It wasn't just my choice.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.310
Daniel was
really freaked out.

27:39.310 --> 27:42.660
He said Josh was talking
about hurting animals.

27:42.660 --> 27:46.530
What? No.
He would never do that.

27:46.530 --> 27:49.320
All I know is that Daniel
was coming home crying,

27:49.320 --> 27:52.670
and I need to
protect my son.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.280
- Daniel!

27:55.280 --> 27:57.370
- Aaaaah!
- Oh, my God.

27:57.370 --> 28:00.280
Oh, my God!

28:00.280 --> 28:02.420
- Oh, my God, Daniel!

28:02.420 --> 28:04.200
Georgia: Call 911!

28:04.200 --> 28:07.070
Daniel! Daniel!

28:07.070 --> 28:08.900
Ah!

28:26.570 --> 28:28.010
I am so sorry.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.530
I don't even know
what to say.

28:31.050 --> 28:33.060
Just stop it!
Just go away!

28:33.060 --> 28:35.930
I never want to
see you again!

28:35.930 --> 28:38.800
It's okay, baby.
Mommy's right here.

29:20.150 --> 29:22.280
Oh, hi, Mommy.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.760
Wanna play?

29:24.760 --> 29:26.330
Hi, baby.

29:32.250 --> 29:35.810
Yeah, you just -- you let us
know if you need anything.

29:35.810 --> 29:38.120
Okay, yeah, and --
and we're s--

29:38.120 --> 29:42.430
I -- all right, bye.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.180
Jesus.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.570
How is he?

29:56.400 --> 29:58.010
I don't even know
where to start.

30:01.010 --> 30:02.620
It's not good.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.590
What do we do?

30:58.420 --> 30:59.900
Josh!

30:59.900 --> 31:02.070
Honey, come and eat!

31:03.820 --> 31:05.210
Josh.

31:05.210 --> 31:08.120
I've been downstairs
calling you.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.430
Josh.

31:10.430 --> 31:14.220
Joshua,
I am speaking to y--

31:14.220 --> 31:17.830
Do you like it?
It's Z.

31:17.830 --> 31:20.440
Um...

31:20.440 --> 31:23.230
I would like you to come down
for lunch, please.

31:23.230 --> 31:24.660
Okay.

31:32.630 --> 31:35.190
Come on. Eat up.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.110
I'm not hungry.

31:37.110 --> 31:39.980
Well, if you're not gonna eat,
at least drink your milk.

31:39.980 --> 31:43.120
Make you big and strong,
just like Z.

31:46.210 --> 31:47.820
Z says I shouldn't.

31:48.990 --> 31:52.260
Really?

31:52.260 --> 31:55.610
Okay, here we go.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.260
I'm gonna drink some.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.570
See?

32:18.800 --> 32:21.590
It's good, huh?

32:42.040 --> 32:44.260
Want some carrots?

33:32.570 --> 33:35.310
Why don't we just hire
some movers to do this?

33:35.310 --> 33:37.880
I don't know.
You want to pay for it?

33:37.880 --> 33:39.840
Good point.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.320
Hey, what's up
with Josh today?

33:44.320 --> 33:46.410
Uh, I don't know.
I guess he's --

33:46.410 --> 33:48.110
he's just a little off.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.890
♪ New friends
along the way♪

33:49.890 --> 33:52.680
♪ We love to sing
and we love to play♪

34:01.210 --> 34:04.130
Oh, no way!

34:04.130 --> 34:05.820
Nice.

34:05.820 --> 34:08.570
Oh, my God.
Wow.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.830
Oh. Oh, wow.

34:12.830 --> 34:14.790
Here, let's get
a shot of that.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.969
For when you find
your Princess Charming.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.139
Oh, yeah, right.Could happen.

34:23.150 --> 34:25.540
I should just douse this place
in gasoline.

34:25.540 --> 34:27.670
I'm sure insurance would have
to be worth something.

34:27.670 --> 34:30.239
Like 10 bucks.

34:30.239 --> 34:32.110
Seriously.
God.

34:37.810 --> 34:39.120
Whoa.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.510
She kept
allof this stuff?

34:41.510 --> 34:42.900
Yeah, tucked away
in her basement

34:42.900 --> 34:45.170
along with all the rest
of her forgotten shit.

34:47.429 --> 34:49.690
You were cute, though.
Mm.

34:49.690 --> 34:51.040
What happened to you?

34:51.040 --> 34:52.650
Mm.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.660
What did you inherit
when your mother died?

35:01.660 --> 35:06.360
Oh, a giant bag of badges
from the 1970s.

35:14.330 --> 35:15.980
Josh?

35:46.750 --> 35:48.930
Josh?

35:48.930 --> 35:50.750
Hey, you shouldn't be
in this room.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.360
Come on.
We're all done packing.

35:55.850 --> 35:57.500
Josh.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.070
Hey, come on.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.720
What's going on
with you?

36:04.380 --> 36:06.290
I don't want you coming
in this room anymore.

36:15.210 --> 36:18.780
Man: Come on, Jenna.
Yeah!

36:18.780 --> 36:21.350
- Oh, that's --

36:21.350 --> 36:23.790
♪ To you♪
Ahhh!

36:23.790 --> 36:25.090
You want
to blow this out?

36:25.090 --> 36:27.570
- No, I'll wait.
- Where's Beth?

36:27.570 --> 36:29.400
- She's up there?

36:29.400 --> 36:32.060
Elizabeth.

36:32.060 --> 36:34.410
Beth,
what are you doing?

36:34.410 --> 36:37.370
Let's go.

36:37.370 --> 36:39.410
Beth!
Okay.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.290
Come on, Z.

36:43.290 --> 36:44.810
Ooh!

36:44.810 --> 36:48.680
There you go!

36:51.550 --> 36:53.210
Come on, Z.

36:57.170 --> 37:00.350
Let's go.

37:00.350 --> 37:01.910
Beth!

37:05.130 --> 37:06.400
Come on, Z.

37:11.570 --> 37:13.320
Come on, Z.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.240
Oh, this is going to
take a few coats.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.410
Shit is dark.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.240
At least he's not playing
with this thing anymore.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.420
Yeah.

38:22.340 --> 38:23.950
Josh, come and eat!

38:34.180 --> 38:35.700
Hey.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.840
You okay?

38:39.840 --> 38:41.880
I don't feel good.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.880
Oh.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.150
Ah, you know what?
Don't -- don't drink that.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.630
Here.

38:49.630 --> 38:51.280
Oh, baby,
you're burning up.

38:51.280 --> 38:55.160
Kevin, can you bring me
the thermometer please?

38:55.160 --> 38:57.250
Josh?

38:57.250 --> 38:59.940
Are you okay?

38:59.940 --> 39:02.080
Oh!

39:02.080 --> 39:04.950
You know what?
That's it, that's it.

39:04.950 --> 39:08.300
Get it out.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.870
Josh:

39:11.090 --> 39:14.090
It's okay, buddy,
get it out.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.920
You're all right.

39:15.920 --> 39:19.220
Well, do you know when he'll be
out of his appointment?

39:19.220 --> 39:20.830
Well, he wrote my kid
a prescription,

39:20.830 --> 39:22.570
and now he's having a reaction.

39:22.570 --> 39:24.710
He's vomiting.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.100
Well, I -- I don't know.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.190
Do we put him on
something different?

39:32.800 --> 39:36.330
You put our son on medication
and didn't tell me?

39:36.330 --> 39:37.680
You're not here, Kevin.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.980
You're not seeing
what I'm seeing.

39:38.980 --> 39:40.200
You don't understand
how bad it is.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.680
He threw a kid
off a fucking balcony.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.510
You don't know that,
Beth!

39:43.510 --> 39:44.770
He said he didn't do it.

39:44.770 --> 39:46.730
Bullshit! Give me the pills.

39:46.730 --> 39:48.690
No.
Give me the pills.

39:48.690 --> 39:51.470
Kevin. Don't.
No! Ugh!

39:51.470 --> 39:53.480
Like you don't keep things
from me, Kevin?

39:53.480 --> 39:55.830
How about the red card?
Huh? How about those?

39:55.830 --> 39:57.570
You don't think it would be nice
to know about those

39:57.570 --> 39:58.920
before everybody
in the school

39:58.920 --> 40:00.220
decided that we were
terrible parents?

40:00.220 --> 40:02.610
Thisis not about us!

40:02.610 --> 40:04.440
This is about him.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.580
They were helping, Kevin.

40:13.150 --> 40:18.630
Beth: ♪ Sleepy time
Sleepy time ♪

40:18.630 --> 40:24.810
♪ Now it is
your sleepy time ♪

40:24.810 --> 40:29.340
♪ And go to sleep ♪

40:29.340 --> 40:31.730
Mechanical voice: Z.

40:37.170 --> 40:39.610
Z.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.020
Z.

40:58.630 --> 41:01.020
Z.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.900
Z.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.210
Beth.

41:25.830 --> 41:27.960
Z.

41:29.310 --> 41:31.400
Z.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.190
Z.

41:37.410 --> 42:07.090
I, M, A, G, I, N, E, Z.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.350
"Imagine Z."

42:44.520 --> 42:46.740
"Imagine Z."

42:48.000 --> 42:50.570
"Imagine Z."

42:53.260 --> 42:55.530
"Imagine Z."

42:56.660 --> 42:59.180
"Imagine Z."

43:02.140 --> 43:04.450
"Imagine Z."

43:23.210 --> 43:25.080
"Imagine Z."

43:40.220 --> 43:41.270
Beth!

43:44.180 --> 43:47.540
It's okay.

43:47.540 --> 43:49.750
I --

43:49.750 --> 43:50.800
What happened, Beth?

43:52.150 --> 43:54.150
What happened in there?

43:55.800 --> 43:58.240
Z is real Kevin.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.590
He -- he's re-- real.

44:00.590 --> 44:04.250
Beth, what you're saying,
its --

44:04.250 --> 44:07.990
I know.
I know how it sounds.

44:07.990 --> 44:11.780
You just --
you have to trust me.

44:11.780 --> 44:14.210
He -- he was
my friend, too.

44:17.740 --> 44:19.700
Okay. Okay.

44:23.530 --> 44:25.360
Okay.

45:38.170 --> 45:40.080
Jenna.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.480
Beth, I --

45:41.480 --> 45:45.870
Jesus. What are --
what are you doing here?

45:45.870 --> 45:48.530
Are you okay?

45:50.400 --> 45:52.180
Are you all right?

45:56.230 --> 45:59.800
I didn't...
get to see her.

46:01.710 --> 46:04.720
I just, uh --

46:04.720 --> 46:07.810
I, uh -- I messed up.

46:07.810 --> 46:09.240
No.
No, you didn't.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.720
It's okay.

46:10.720 --> 46:11.980
Mm.

46:11.980 --> 46:14.550
It's okay.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.120
Okay, no, no.
Okay.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.650
Mm.

46:23.650 --> 46:26.960
Come on. It's okay.

46:26.960 --> 46:29.310
We'll sort it out.

46:29.310 --> 46:31.310
She's our mom.

46:31.310 --> 46:32.960
She's all we had.

46:36.570 --> 46:38.490
We still have each other,
huh?

46:38.490 --> 46:42.450
Ah. I --

46:42.450 --> 46:45.150
I just need to --
to lie down.

46:45.150 --> 46:48.280
I just need to lie down.
Okay.

46:50.110 --> 46:53.420
Ah.

47:05.780 --> 47:07.560
It's time
for your ni-nights.

47:07.560 --> 47:10.170
I don't want to do 'em.

47:10.170 --> 47:11.610
Why not?

47:11.610 --> 47:13.180
I don't feel like it.

47:17.140 --> 47:19.620
Honey, what's wrong?

47:19.620 --> 47:22.230
You saw Z, didn't you?

47:23.840 --> 47:25.190
What do you mean?

47:27.410 --> 47:29.630
He saw you, too.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.030
Hello? Dr. Seager?

47:43.030 --> 47:46.470
Um, I'm sorry to call so late.
It -- it's Beth.

47:46.470 --> 47:49.040
Dr. Seager:
No, no, it's fine.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.430
Is everything all right?

47:50.430 --> 47:52.780
I ju-- actually,
just was wondering

47:52.780 --> 47:57.260
if maybe I could schedule,
um, an appointment?

47:57.260 --> 47:59.260
Is everything's okay
with Josh?

48:04.360 --> 48:07.530
Um, it's not for Josh.

48:07.530 --> 48:10.890
Mm. It's for me.

48:10.890 --> 48:13.410
It's happening again,
isn't it?

48:13.410 --> 48:16.110
Same thing that happened
when you were a child.

48:27.380 --> 48:32.120
When I heard your son
say the name Z,

48:32.120 --> 48:34.690
I realized
I'd heard it before.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.880
What is this?

48:47.880 --> 48:51.710
You were a patient
of mine, Beth.

48:51.710 --> 48:55.970
Your father brought you to me
when you were Josh's age.

48:55.970 --> 48:59.890
He begged me to help you.

48:59.890 --> 49:01.590
He was terrified.

49:03.680 --> 49:07.460
Your friend was unlike anything
I'd ever encountered.

49:07.460 --> 49:11.860
He was... dangerous,

49:11.860 --> 49:16.250
destructive, obsessive.

49:19.950 --> 49:22.300
Of course, when he stopped
bringing you in,

49:22.300 --> 49:24.260
I -- I thought
you'd outgrown it.

49:27.440 --> 49:30.140
I had no idea
what had transpired.

49:33.970 --> 49:35.710
I want to
show you something.

49:40.890 --> 49:42.320
Dr. Seager:
Hello, Elizabeth.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.500
Hi.

49:44.500 --> 49:47.370
Hello, Z.

49:47.370 --> 49:51.420
So, Beth, your dad told me that
you didn't love him anymore.

49:51.420 --> 49:53.680
Why would you say
such a thing?

49:53.680 --> 49:56.030
Because it's true.

49:56.030 --> 49:59.730
Your dad said that you're
refusing to go to school.

49:59.730 --> 50:02.870
Z says I don't need school.
He says he'll take care of me.

50:02.870 --> 50:05.260
What happens
when you outgrow Z?

50:05.260 --> 50:08.480
Every child outgrows their
imaginary friend, you know.

50:08.480 --> 50:11.180
Z says when I'm older,
he'll find me,

50:11.180 --> 50:15.230
and we'll get married,
and we'll have lots of babies.

50:20.010 --> 50:23.100
It's been waiting
for you, Beth,

50:23.100 --> 50:26.320
and I think
it's using your son

50:26.320 --> 50:29.630
to try to reconnect
with you.

50:29.630 --> 50:31.850
But it wants only you.

51:11.150 --> 51:13.420
Oh, come on, come on.
Just pick up, please.

51:13.420 --> 51:15.290
Hey, this is Kevin Parsons
I'm not avai--

51:15.290 --> 51:17.030
Oh, shit.

51:32.740 --> 51:34.700
Kevin, please.

51:34.700 --> 51:36.260
Please pick up.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.880
Hey, this is Kevin Parsons
I'm not available...

51:39.880 --> 51:41.840
Agh! ...to take your call
right now.

52:07.030 --> 52:09.340
Hi, buddy.
I love you.

52:19.830 --> 52:20.960
Come on.

52:22.220 --> 52:24.050
Get out of the way!

52:42.630 --> 52:45.730
Oh, Josh.

52:45.730 --> 52:49.290
Mechanical voice: Z.

52:54.260 --> 52:55.870
Z.

52:58.350 --> 52:59.910
Z.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.880
Z.

54:15.990 --> 54:19.120
Kevin!

54:19.120 --> 54:24.130
Josh!

54:29.650 --> 54:31.570
Kevin.

54:34.920 --> 54:36.750
Mommy!

54:36.750 --> 54:38.750
I'm scared!

54:38.750 --> 54:40.060
Josh!

54:42.540 --> 54:44.670
Josh!

54:44.670 --> 54:46.720
Aah!

54:46.720 --> 54:49.200
Josh!
Let him out, please!

54:49.200 --> 54:52.590
Ah! Ah! Ah!

55:01.340 --> 55:03.730
Please!
I'll be yours.

55:03.730 --> 55:06.910
Please don't take my baby.

55:06.910 --> 55:10.040
Z, I'll be yours, okay?
Please.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.390
Please just let him out.
Please.

55:12.390 --> 55:14.480
Ah! Ah!

55:14.480 --> 55:16.660
Ah! Josh!

55:16.660 --> 55:19.100
- Mommy?
- Josh!

55:21.050 --> 55:22.710
- Mommy.
- It's okay.

55:22.710 --> 55:24.800
Okay.

55:24.800 --> 55:26.760
Okay, baby.

55:26.760 --> 55:28.630
Mommy.

56:09.360 --> 56:12.150
You don't want me to be taking
care of Josh right now, Beth,

56:12.150 --> 56:14.320
trust me.I don't have any choice.

56:16.630 --> 56:18.720
You're all I have left.

56:23.460 --> 56:25.860
He's not safe with me.

56:25.860 --> 56:28.730
He won't be safe
with me, either.

56:28.730 --> 56:30.300
It's not forever, okay?

56:30.300 --> 56:32.080
It's just until
I figure some things out.

56:32.080 --> 56:34.430
Take this,

56:34.430 --> 56:37.430
and you
clean yourself up.

56:37.430 --> 56:41.660
If not for me,
then for him.

56:41.660 --> 56:43.480
Okay?

58:02.080 --> 58:04.000
All right.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.390
Just...

58:06.390 --> 58:07.790
imagine Z.

58:09.660 --> 58:11.620
Imagine Z.

58:15.840 --> 58:18.010
Imagine Z.

58:18.670 --> 58:20.490
Imagine Z.

58:29.020 --> 58:32.640
Imagine Z.

58:38.340 --> 58:40.600
Imagine Z.

58:54.310 --> 58:59.190
Three... two...

58:59.190 --> 59:02.060
one.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.970
One...

59:03.970 --> 59:06.240
two...

59:06.240 --> 59:09.370
three.

59:09.370 --> 59:12.890
Ready or not,

59:12.890 --> 59:15.420
I'll find you, Z.

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:35.590
I'm gonna find you.

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:53.860
I found you.

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.000
I forgot 2 %.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.480
I'm sorry.
I forgot...

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.090
I know.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:01.630
2 %.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.990
Dr. Seager: Beth?
I know you're in there.

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:06.260
I spoke to your sister.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.260
She told me
what happened.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.310
Dr. Seager.

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:18.490
Are you okay?

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.490
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:25.020
I heard about Kevin.
I'm so sorry.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.370
Is someone in here
with you?

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:33.940
No.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.510
Can I come in?

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:42.950
I don't -- I don't think that
that would be a good idea.

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.380
Please.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.390
Beth...

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.430
I think I can help you.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.140
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.750
Is Josh here?

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:11.850
Uh, no,
he's at my sister's.

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:33.000
Uh, maybe we could...
sit in the living room.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.090
He's here with you,
isn't he, Beth?

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:41.050
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.010
Is this what you want?

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:48.060
To be with him?

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.590
I -- I think
you should go, please.

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.120
Please.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.990
Listen to me.

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:15.470
You created this thing.

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:17.210
It's all in your head.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.390
This is not real.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.620
This is not real.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:32.680
No!

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.510
Stop, please.

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:38.380
Please stop!

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.340
Please! Stop!

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.740
I'll be right out.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.180
Okay?

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.700
I'll be right out.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:43.069
What do you want for breakfast?

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.779
Z, I can't find you.

01:08:57.779 --> 01:09:00.439
Do we have to
play this game tonight?

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:02.310
It's so late.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:52.490
Ah! Ah.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.620
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:33.630
The floor... is lava!

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:37.810
And you can't step
in the lava...

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:40.510
or else you'll get burnt.

01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.160
Come on, Z.

01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:49.300
Ha!
You're stuck, Z!

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.360
- Hello?
- Jenna.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.930
Jenna:
Beth? Oh, my God.

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:09.540
Why aren't you
answering your texts?

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.720
I know. Listen, I don't have
a lot of time to talk, okay?

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.630
I'm on my way up!
I can find you.

01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:21.290
Can you put Josh on the line
for me, please?

01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:23.600
Josh: Mom?

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.640
Hey! Hi, Josh.
How are you, baby?

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.210
I miss you.

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:32.080
Listen, I'm gonna see you
really soon, okay?

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.090
You tell Aunty Jenna
that I will call her

01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:36.740
as soon as I can.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.570
You stole my friend!

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:40.700
Josh?

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.680
Oh, shit.

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:07.550
Z?

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:27.580
Hello?
Beth: Jenna.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.350
I need you to get Josh
out of there right now, please.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:32.290
- Whoa. Slow down. -Are you with him
right now? Do you see him? -Yeah, he's fine.

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:33.690
I'm looking right at him
right now.

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.330
Okay, listen,
I want you to put him in the car and just get as far away as you can.

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:37.200
We're fine.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.890
It's just, how much longer do
you need me to keep him for?

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.290
Ugh! You're not
listening to me. Please!

01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:45.040
I want you to just get Josh
out of there right now.

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:47.210
It's not safe.He's fine, Beth,
I promise.

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.120
Josh?

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.820
What you mean he's gone?
You said he was right there.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.300
Beth, I know.
Just -- Josh?

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.910
Just give me a second.

01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:00.130
What do you mean
give you a second?

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:01.740
Where is he? Josh.

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.090
Oh, shit.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:07.570
Answer me.
Where is Josh?

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:08.790
I have no idea.

01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:10.310
He was just
sitting right there,

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:12.360
and he just disappeared.
Just give me a second.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.710
Please, I need you to
tell me you see him.

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:17.620
Oh! Where is he?

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.890
Josh!

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:20.840
Jenna, please talk to me!

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.630
Where is my son?!

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.600
Ma'am, open the door.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.080
We're here
to help you, Beth.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.040
Jenna?

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.260
Jenna, are you there,
please?

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.350
Josh!

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:50.790
Jenna, please tell me
you're there.

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:53.180
I'm looking, okay?
Just give me a second.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.840

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:25.210
Josh!

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:28.170

Jenna, tell me

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:42.880
Is Z in there with you,
Beth?

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.020
He has my son!

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.370
Remember...

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.240
this is all
in your mind, Beth.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.850
No, I don't know.

01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:54.760
This thing -- you got to get it
out of your head.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.160
You created it.
Only you can stop it.

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:06.040
Only you can stop it.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.820
I can stop it.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:18.790
Josh!

01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:38.520
Jenna: I got him.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.520
I got him, Beth.
He's okay.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.530
Oh, Josh is okay.

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:46.090
He's okay.

01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:47.700
Josh: Mommy?

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.000
All right.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.610
Here we go.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.450
Good.

01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:52.030
Jenna: Okay, Josh.

01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:53.600
Try to get some sleep.

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:03.170
Can I do
the ni-nights?

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.520
Not tonight.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.780
We'll do them
tomorrow.

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:35.510
Josh: Good night, Mom.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.730
Good night, Dad.

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:43.910
