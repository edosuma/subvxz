01:24.052 --> 01:24.986
Fuck!

01:26.020 --> 01:28.556
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, honey bun.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.290
We haven't heard from you
in days.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.092
Daddy and I were starting
to get worried.

01:32.125 --> 01:35.462
What do you mean?
I literally texted you last night.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.632
<i>Well, not this morning.</i>

01:37.665 --> 01:40.267
<i>Fox News</i> is saying that
there's all these gangbangers

01:40.300 --> 01:42.670
out in California
like that Cript gang.

01:42.704 --> 01:45.439
Um,
it's the "Crip" gang, Mom,

01:45.472 --> 01:46.975
and I live in
the Hollywood Hills,

01:47.008 --> 01:49.376
so we don't see
many of them around here.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.045
Have you found
a job yet, sweetie?

01:51.079 --> 01:53.213
Because we didn't
pay for you to move to LA

01:53.246 --> 01:57.085
just so you could sit around and
drink Bloody Marys all day long.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.186
Uh, Mom.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.055
Mom, hang...
Hang on one second.

02:01.089 --> 02:02.389
Why? What's happening?

02:02.422 --> 02:04.458
- What is... Is it a drive-by?
- <i>Mom. Mom!</i>

02:04.491 --> 02:06.493
Just hold on.
Hold on for one... Fuck.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.896
Fuck me!

02:08.930 --> 02:10.430
- <i>Hello?</i>
- God damn it.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.000
<i>Who the hell are you
talking to on the other line?</i>

02:12.033 --> 02:13.001
What do you want, Damon?

02:13.034 --> 02:15.803
I tried calling you last night,
seven times.

02:15.837 --> 02:17.839
You didn't answer, of course,
so I'm just assuming

02:17.872 --> 02:19.574
you were out partying
somewhere.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.808
I went to bed early.

02:20.842 --> 02:23.276
I'm still not used
to the time difference.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.746
Time difference?

02:24.779 --> 02:26.714
You've lived here
for two weeks, Hannah.

02:26.748 --> 02:28.716
God, Jersey girls
are all the same.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.385
Just how many girls have
you dated from Jersey, anyway?

02:31.418 --> 02:33.286
And what county
are we talking about?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.056
Morris, Bergen, Essex?

02:35.089 --> 02:38.026
If you say Monmouth County,
I swear to God I'll kill myself.

02:38.059 --> 02:39.927
<i>You can't trust people
from Jersey...</i>

02:41.663 --> 02:42.764
Hey, Hannah. What's up?

02:42.797 --> 02:45.133
Oh, hey, Teddy. What's up?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.734
Beautiful day, isn't it?

02:46.768 --> 02:49.070
Bet you don't get this weather
back east, right?

02:51.639 --> 02:53.508
Well, I'll see you around.

02:59.814 --> 03:01.649
<i>Hello!</i>

03:01.683 --> 03:05.452
Hello! Fucking
answer me, woman!

03:05.485 --> 03:08.355
- <i>Who the hell are you talking to now?</i>
- What? Oh, it...

03:08.388 --> 03:10.024
No, it was just
the recycling guy.

03:10.058 --> 03:12.627
Do you think I'm some sort
of idiot, Hannah?

03:12.660 --> 03:15.797
They pick up trash on Thursdays.
It's Tuesday.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.799
<i>This is exactly
what I'm talking about.</i>

03:17.832 --> 03:19.901
- I'll have to call you back.
- <i>This is why I don't trust you.</i>

03:33.815 --> 03:36.651
Maybe we can
switch positions?

03:37.118 --> 03:39.587
Um, sure.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.266
I feel so...

03:55.636 --> 03:57.739
I feel so close to you.

03:57.772 --> 04:00.440
Mmm-hmm. Just breathe.

04:00.474 --> 04:03.177
Remember,
what lies behind us

04:03.211 --> 04:04.645
and what lies in front of us

04:04.679 --> 04:08.149
are tiny matters compared
to what lies within us.

04:09.851 --> 04:12.553
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yes.

04:12.587 --> 04:14.722
If we're always chasing after
the next moment,

04:14.756 --> 04:17.191
how can we ever enjoy
the one that we're in?

04:17.225 --> 04:20.360
Just think about that
and breathe deeply.

04:25.066 --> 04:27.034
Mmm.

04:29.170 --> 04:31.139
You know what?
This is very relaxing.

04:31.172 --> 04:32.305
Mmm-hmm, yeah.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.912
- Um... that's...
- Oh!

04:37.945 --> 04:40.848
Um... It's okay. Let's just
maybe switch positions

04:40.882 --> 04:42.550
to the horizontal lotus.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.051
Sorry, that's not supposed
to happen.

04:44.085 --> 04:46.319
No, no, please.
Let's just shift our aura

04:46.353 --> 04:48.689
to a more platonic one.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.490
I just think you're
really good at what you do.

04:50.525 --> 04:52.994
And I... I feel like
you get me.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.096
This happens to
a lot of my clients, honestly.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.131
We call it
a breakthrough moment.

04:57.165 --> 04:58.398
It is?

04:59.667 --> 05:02.136
That's what you learned
in medical school?

05:02.170 --> 05:03.771
Um, well, no,

05:03.805 --> 05:05.973
but I did study Deepak Chopra.

05:06.007 --> 05:08.075
His online courses
are the tits.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.647
Deepak Chopra...

05:12.680 --> 05:17.552
Okay, just breathe
and repeat after me...

05:17.585 --> 05:19.419
I am in control
of my emotions...

05:19.452 --> 05:21.522
I am in control
of my emotions.

05:21.556 --> 05:23.390
And today I choose happiness.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.092
Today I choose happiness!

05:27.295 --> 05:33.100
Okay, um...
Just close your eyes and breathe.

05:36.403 --> 05:40.074
We must be willing to let go of
the life that we have planned

05:40.107 --> 05:43.211
so as to have the life
that is waiting for us.

05:43.244 --> 05:46.581
When we let go,
we create space for something better.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.719
That's so right.

05:53.054 --> 05:56.157
But I just can't believe
she left me.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.726
I'll never have
an intimate connection again.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.562
That's not true.

06:01.596 --> 06:03.030
I'm sure there's
plenty of women out there

06:03.064 --> 06:05.099
you could have
an intimate connection with.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.300
Yeah?

06:06.334 --> 06:09.136
I don't know any, but I'm sure
they're out there.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.238
Tissue?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.073
Thank you.

06:13.975 --> 06:15.543
Brooklyn, you're not even
gonna believe

06:15.576 --> 06:16.744
what happened to me just now.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.280
- I can come back...
- No, no!

06:19.313 --> 06:21.182
Our session was just ending.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.950
Yeah. Wait, what? It is?

06:22.984 --> 06:25.620
- Yes, it is.
- Just like my marriage.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.588
Now, if you refer a friend,

06:27.622 --> 06:29.456
you will get your tenth visit
half-off.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.826
- Oh, thank you.
- You can exit through the kitchen.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.228
Please be sure
to lock the gate behind you

06:34.262 --> 06:35.129
because we have a dog.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.198
Thank you so much.
You're like an angel.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.733
Oh, I know. Go ahead.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.101
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.938
If you could drop this off
on your way out,

06:43.971 --> 06:45.673
that'd be really helpful.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.474
Thanks, sweetie. Bye-bye.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.243
And good luck.

06:49.277 --> 06:51.012
- Good luck.
- Bye, now.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.748
Dude, what the fuck?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.783
I know! $200.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.184
I already paid for
my business cards

06:57.218 --> 06:58.953
and three coffees
from Starbucks.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.721
What the fuck is
a conscious cuddle, anyway?

07:00.755 --> 07:02.422
A safe way to make money
from home, Hannah.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.292
So is Mary Kay.

07:04.325 --> 07:05.626
I don't know what that is.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.094
What is that?
Is that a Jersey thing?

07:07.128 --> 07:09.764
Are you in the position
to be giving spiritual advice?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.098
Because you don't
believe in God

07:11.132 --> 07:12.633
and your therapist says
you're one step away

07:12.667 --> 07:14.302
from being
a fully-fledged sociopath.

07:14.335 --> 07:17.038
A week ago, the old Brooklyn
would have hit a bitch

07:17.071 --> 07:18.773
for talking to me like that...

07:18.806 --> 07:20.808
But I live in LA now
and I'm spiritual.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.343
So I'm just going to
kindly ask you

07:22.376 --> 07:24.679
to go into the kitchen
and make me that fat toast

07:24.712 --> 07:26.747
I like so much
with the avocados.

07:26.781 --> 07:28.582
Spiritually shut the door
on your way out, too.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.717
Namaste.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.652
- Meow.
- Isn't what you're doing

07:31.686 --> 07:33.688
kind of like escorting?

07:33.721 --> 07:36.190
Isn't there supposed to be
avocado on this?

07:36.223 --> 07:39.694
Look, there's nothing sexual
about it.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.028
If anyone gets creepy
with me,

07:41.062 --> 07:42.495
I have a taser
in my night stand

07:42.530 --> 07:43.731
right by my vibrator.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.099
That sounds safe.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.601
No. No.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.803
Oh, fuck, no.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.038
Where are all the quality guys
on this thing?

07:51.072 --> 07:53.441
It says they're all actors
and entrepreneurs and shit.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.177
Well, "entrepreneur"
doesn't sound so bad.

07:56.210 --> 07:59.447
"Entrepreneur" means unemployed
or drug dealer, Hannah.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.416
Considering you just broke off
your engagement two months ago,

08:02.450 --> 08:05.453
do you really think you need
to be on any more dating apps?

08:05.485 --> 08:09.557
Says the girl with the terrible,
jealous, judgmental boyfriend.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.292
Besides, I'm the one
who ended it,

08:11.325 --> 08:12.827
and I'm totally okay.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.662
Moving on to bigger
and better things.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.665
Like "conscious cuddling"?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.735
I'm just saying,
we've only lived here for two weeks

08:20.768 --> 08:23.404
and already there's
Rob the bartender,

08:23.437 --> 08:24.805
Roberto the club promoter,

08:24.839 --> 08:26.207
Chad the skateboarder,

08:26.240 --> 08:28.042
and Bob
the stand-up comedian.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.176
I mean, if you do
the math,

08:29.210 --> 08:30.845
that's three Robs and a Chad.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.380
Would you like me
to continue?

08:32.413 --> 08:33.714
You're right.

08:33.748 --> 08:35.883
Total fucking losers.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.418
That's why I need to get
on Raya.

08:38.853 --> 08:42.056
Raya... The dating app
for celebrities.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.858
Kira met Matthew Perry
on that thing.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.993
But you're not a celebrity.

08:46.027 --> 08:50.331
I have almost 6,000 followers
on Instagram, Hannah.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.599
I'm an influencer.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.235
Well, it sounds like you're
really "breaking the Internet."

08:54.268 --> 08:56.904
Thank you. Instagram followers
aren't cheap.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.051
It smells like sh-dookie
in here.

09:10.084 --> 09:11.752
Well, if you took the dog
on more walks,

09:11.786 --> 09:13.354
we wouldn't be sitting
in his toilet.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.555
I walk.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.091
Going to take selfies at
Runyon doesn't count, Brooklyn.

09:17.825 --> 09:18.893
I'm going to make food.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.361
I feel like
we're always eating.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.729
Basically.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.265
Okay, well, just remember that I
can't have gluten, dairy or meat.

09:24.298 --> 09:27.334
Oh, I see. Chef Hannah
at your service.

09:27.368 --> 09:29.070
Well, I would offer
to help you,

09:29.103 --> 09:31.839
but we both know that the only thing
I have control over in the kitchen

09:31.872 --> 09:33.707
is the fire extinguisher. So...

09:34.875 --> 09:36.844
- Oh, my God!
- What?

09:36.877 --> 09:38.412
- Fucking brace yourself.
- What?

09:38.446 --> 09:40.247
- It's Christian.
- What?

09:40.281 --> 09:42.817
Christian! Our high school
PE coach.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.618
The one everyone was
in love with?

09:44.652 --> 09:46.854
Yes. Oh, my God.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.489
Do you remember
when we met him?

09:48.523 --> 09:50.357
You just decided to commute
from Jersey,

09:50.391 --> 09:53.360
and I had just transferred from
that ratchet all-girls cunt academy.

09:53.394 --> 09:55.896
I remember.
You just matched with him?

09:55.930 --> 09:57.898
Yeah. Holy shit.

09:57.932 --> 09:59.633
I guess that means
he lives here now.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.202
- Mmm.
- Weird.

10:01.235 --> 10:02.870
Did you even do PE, though?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.105
I thought you got
a note excusing you

10:04.138 --> 10:05.973
because you practiced Reiki.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.775
He messaged me.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.478
Okay, I'm not going to
respond right away

10:10.512 --> 10:13.414
because I want to
not look desperate.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.583
Yeah, that's smart.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.554
Okay, what do I say?

10:20.788 --> 10:21.889
I don't want
to look desperate,

10:21.922 --> 10:23.357
so I was thinking...

10:24.758 --> 10:27.027
Oh, yeah,
that's playing it real cool.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.164
Ah, he already responded.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.900
Be a doll
and grab the Pinot.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.335
I probably shouldn't drink.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.470
You know Damon thinks I'm
super annoying when I'm drunk.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.038
Pretty soon you're not even
going to be able

10:38.072 --> 10:39.608
to take a shit
without checking in

10:39.640 --> 10:40.908
with Probation
Officer Damon.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.910
That is not true.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.478
I shit when I want.

10:44.513 --> 10:47.114
It's a little twisted you still use these.

10:47.148 --> 10:50.251
It's a little
twisted you only open one bottle.

10:53.888 --> 10:55.524
Ah!

10:55.557 --> 10:57.758
He invited us
to go to San Diego...

10:57.791 --> 10:59.528
Or he invited me,
but you're coming.

10:59.561 --> 11:01.395
Because you don't have
a driver's license?

11:01.428 --> 11:04.465
I do. I just forgot to pay
those parking tickets.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.500
Ah, because you're
irresponsible, then.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.702
Jesus Christ, why are you
always such a buzzkill?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.271
What's in San Diego?

11:10.304 --> 11:12.206
I should stay here
and try and look for a job.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.208
They don't just hand out
production jobs, B.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.210
And my parents
are really riding my ass.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.445
I really don't want to
end up in reality again.

11:24.485 --> 11:27.154
- "Catch up."
- What kind of event is this exactly?

11:27.188 --> 11:28.657
Who the fuck cares?
It's Comic Con.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.258
And I'm pretty sure "catch up"
is a euphemism for dirty sex.

11:31.292 --> 11:34.061
Or maybe he really does
just wanna catch up.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.396
This thing is
literally tomorrow

11:35.429 --> 11:37.064
and I don't think that Damon
would appreciate it

11:37.097 --> 11:38.999
if I just left
without saying anything.

11:39.033 --> 11:41.235
Great. We'll rent a car.
We'll leave tomorrow.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.337
This is gonna be
the most epic road trip ever.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.040
It's like our Romy and Michele
Tucson "here we come," moment.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.741
Don't you have
to work, anyway?

11:47.775 --> 11:48.776
Bitch, please.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.844
I'm a freelance
cuddle consultant.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.079
I make my own schedule.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.052
Ugh.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.386
We're going.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.523
This could be the future
father of my children.

12:01.556 --> 12:03.090
Or at least the dog.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.491
I'm not getting any younger.

12:04.526 --> 12:06.528
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

12:06.561 --> 12:07.696
Plus, Comic Con?

12:07.728 --> 12:10.030
You said that Marvel movies
give you anxiety.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.765
Not the ones
with Chris Hemsworth.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.668
Hello, Daddy.

12:13.702 --> 12:14.835
I wonder
if he's on Raya.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.136
He's married.

12:16.705 --> 12:17.805
So?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.947
Welcome to DUI's car rental.
How can I help you today?

12:26.981 --> 12:29.049
Hello. We'd like to rent
a car, please.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.251
I can definitely help you.

12:30.284 --> 12:33.120
- Do you have a reservation?
- No.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.456
But I'm sure we can
figure something out.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.659
I'll see
what I can do for you.

12:37.692 --> 12:39.360
Thanks.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.129
What the fuck, Hannah?

12:42.162 --> 12:43.998
What happened to you?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.634
Well, I thought I was
looking a little pale,

12:45.667 --> 12:48.002
so I went and got one of
those airbrush tans.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.304
Okay. You look like
a black Rosie Perez

12:50.337 --> 12:52.306
or the guy from
<i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

12:52.339 --> 12:54.842
Clearly. It's gonna wash off
in the shower in two hours,

12:54.875 --> 12:56.043
and then it'll look great.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.212
It fucking better.
I'm so sorry.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.347
Here's your Venti matcha.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.049
Almond milk?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.652
Do I look like an idiot?

13:03.685 --> 13:06.320
- Is that a legitimate question right now?
- Yes, it's almond milk.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.322
Not everyone is trying to
poison you, Brooklyn.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.823
You know I have bad IBS.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.126
I have one car left.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.927
- We'll take it.
- Great.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.598
I'm hoping it's a Mustang.

13:16.631 --> 13:18.432
- How cute would we look in a Mustang?
- We need an SUV.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.434
We need to be up high,
I'm little.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.036
What about, like, a Cadillac?

13:22.069 --> 13:23.804
- Okay.
- Or like an Escalade.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.139
Whatever's classy.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.407
Escalade's great.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.842
I just don't want to
roll up in something janky.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.010
It better be something nice.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.881
I don't think
this is almond milk.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.482
Where the hell is this guy?

13:35.517 --> 13:37.284
I feel like
I'm fucking melting out here.

13:39.554 --> 13:41.723
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.295
Absolutely not.

13:48.329 --> 13:50.831
I'm not getting in it. No.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.199
Your chariot awaits.

13:52.433 --> 13:53.601
No.

13:53.635 --> 13:55.369
What happened to the handle?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.171
Just grab the one
inside the door.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.546
Give me the keys.

14:06.781 --> 14:07.915
Oopsies.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.384
I have to shower or I'm gonna
get stuck looking like this.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.086
We have to get in
that house.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.420
Oh, fine.

14:13.454 --> 14:15.289
I'll just hop the fence
and let you in from inside.

14:15.322 --> 14:18.158
It's not my fault your Range
Rover's on a flatbed truck

14:18.192 --> 14:19.893
just now
approaching Nebraska.

14:19.927 --> 14:23.464
Now we have to ride in this piece of
shit rental with no air conditioning.

14:23.497 --> 14:25.232
Okay, next time
we'll take your car.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.668
Oh, right.
You don't have one.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.536
So, if you have
nothing further to say,

14:28.570 --> 14:30.705
I'm about to parkour my way
into the house for you.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.483
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Teddy.

14:42.517 --> 14:45.386
Hey, Hannah. I didn't know
you had a RAV4...

14:46.153 --> 14:47.955
- with no AC.
- It's a rental.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.991
Um, my Rover is late
from New York.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.459
- I'm suing.
- Right on.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.562
It's kind of like that
Kanye song, am I right?

14:54.596 --> 14:56.230
- Huh?
- "...push a RAV4."

14:56.263 --> 14:57.998
"RAV4..."
Something, something.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.434
Oh, the RAV4. Right, right.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.736
- Yeah.
- Where you all going?

15:01.770 --> 15:04.004
Oh, just to San Diego
for Comic Con for the night.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.305
It's a casual getaway.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.107
Oh, dope. I always wanted
to go to that,

15:07.141 --> 15:08.576
but never could
get away from work.

15:08.610 --> 15:11.613
- Mmm.
- I mean, I love all, like, the costumes...

15:11.646 --> 15:14.047
Yeah. It should be
pretty fun.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.182
We're pretty excited.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.785
- There's...
- Come on, cunt.

15:16.818 --> 15:19.286
We got to get your ass in the
shower, get our junk in the trunk,

15:19.319 --> 15:22.122
and I have to take a regular
milk-shit, you liar.

15:22.156 --> 15:23.924
I knew that wasn't
almond milk.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.193
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, Brooklyn.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.327
Classy as always, huh?

15:27.361 --> 15:28.929
It is so good to see you.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.800
And in something other than a
Tommy Bahama shirt, nonetheless.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.467
Although I'm pretty sure
the courts require you

15:33.500 --> 15:35.302
to wear that monitor on your ankle.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.672
Well, Hannah,
I'm gonna get running,

15:37.705 --> 15:39.908
but, uh... it was good
to see you.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.008
Good to see you.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.584
Okay, so we have about
four hours till the show starts.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.452
That gives us enough time
to go to the hotel,

15:51.485 --> 15:54.455
power change, power drink,
power up our cell phones

15:54.488 --> 15:55.924
and get there
with enough time to pre-game.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.025
Where we staying, anyway?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.360
I don't know. It's this hotel
I found on HotelTonight,

16:00.394 --> 16:01.830
but it actually looks
pretty nice.

16:01.863 --> 16:05.667
There is a private bathroom
and a luxury hot tub.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.903
Aw, all right. Maybe this will
actually be kind of fun.

16:08.937 --> 16:10.738
I think so.

16:10.772 --> 16:14.074
Do you remember
this song from high school?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.911
- Hell, yes.
- Oh, my God. Turn it up.

16:16.945 --> 16:19.112
<i>♪ Oh, how she rocks</i>

16:19.146 --> 16:21.315
<i>♪ In Keds and tube socks</i>

16:21.348 --> 16:22.750
Oh! I should snap this

16:22.784 --> 16:25.687
<i>♪ But she doesn't know

16:26.788 --> 16:31.793

16:56.751 --> 16:58.920
Okay.

16:58.953 --> 17:01.021
This is perfect.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.625
Kira Matthews took a photo
here and she got 3,000 likes

17:03.658 --> 17:05.927
and I have better engagement
than she does.

17:05.960 --> 17:06.995
I really have to pee.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.363
Is there a bathroom
around here somewhere?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.231
It's the perfect midway.
It screams,

17:11.265 --> 17:13.535
"I'm on a fucking road trip,
bitches."

17:13.568 --> 17:15.435
Can't we just enjoy
the scenery instead of plotting

17:15.469 --> 17:17.170
- your next Instagram photo?
- Here.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.439
Just be sure to get me
from a good angle, would you?

17:21.709 --> 17:24.444
No, not low to high.
High to low! High to low.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.514
You're gonna make me
look like a fucking whale.

17:26.548 --> 17:28.983
Facetune can only do so much.

17:30.018 --> 17:30.985
Like that?

17:31.019 --> 17:33.555
Um, could you get on my
side, my right side?

17:33.588 --> 17:35.757
And get the mountain
in the background.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.224
Also hurry,
'cause I'm sucking in.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.359
Well, if you would fucking
stop talking so I could take

17:39.393 --> 17:41.328
the goddamn photo
and find a fucking bathroom

17:41.361 --> 17:42.897
that would be great.
Thank you.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.868
How's it look?

17:48.937 --> 17:50.437
Uh, just a couple more.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.372
And do not get that car
in the background.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.042
I don't want anyone thinking
I drive that.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.314
Okay. Got it. Took
approximately 250 photos,

18:00.347 --> 18:01.849
so you should find one
you like.

18:01.883 --> 18:03.450
Sh-weet!

18:03.483 --> 18:04.953
All right,
back in the car we go.

18:04.986 --> 18:07.220
We gotta get there
and you're driving really slow.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.656
You gotta pump on the gas.

18:08.690 --> 18:10.558
Um... But the bathroom?
And by the way,

18:10.592 --> 18:11.726
it's called safe driving.

18:11.759 --> 18:13.293
My driver's ed teacher
used to say,

18:13.327 --> 18:15.029
"Alert today,
alive tomorrow."

18:15.063 --> 18:16.496
Just trying to keep us alive.

18:16.531 --> 18:18.533
Whatever, <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

18:42.023 --> 18:43.457
This is it.

18:45.627 --> 18:47.695
Hmmm. It looked better online.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.229
We'll see.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.465
We're here.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.468
Okay, quick.
I don't want him to see us.

18:54.502 --> 18:55.803
We made it.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.173
Thank you.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.982
This looks like
a six-year-old's bedroom.

19:08.016 --> 19:11.218
Or an obnoxious European man
with a man bun

19:11.251 --> 19:14.722
who vacations in South Beach and wears
a gold chain over his hairy chest.

19:15.957 --> 19:16.958
Okay.

19:19.761 --> 19:20.795
Hello.

19:24.732 --> 19:28.770
So, you just be
two luscious ladies, huh?

19:28.803 --> 19:31.005
One night in San Diego,
correct?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.507
Uh-huh.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.909
Is the whole hotel like this?

19:35.543 --> 19:36.811
Like what?

19:38.079 --> 19:41.281
Goat fucker!

19:41.314 --> 19:44.418
Bad news. We have a small
cleanup issue in your room.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.486
The "ceiling" caved in.

19:46.521 --> 19:49.222
The good news is,
I'm going to upgrade you, eh?

19:49.256 --> 19:50.925
To our celebrity suite.

19:50.958 --> 19:51.993
Ooh!

19:52.026 --> 19:54.729
What makes it
a celebrity suite?

19:54.762 --> 19:56.731
It's the best room
in the hotel.

19:59.332 --> 20:02.436
It's so dark in here.
I can't see anything.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.438
Open a window.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.873
What the fuck?

20:05.907 --> 20:07.942
I just banged
my fucking toe!

20:07.975 --> 20:09.577
God damn it!

20:09.610 --> 20:10.678
Oh!

20:15.883 --> 20:17.819
Oh, no.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.054
Ew.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.056
- No.
- What is this?

20:22.090 --> 20:23.490
No. No!

20:23.524 --> 20:24.892
No!

20:27.028 --> 20:28.261
Ew.

20:29.864 --> 20:31.199
Oh, hello.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.267
Here are two complementary
welcome glasses of Prosecco.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.403
Mmm. Thank you.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.972
If there's anything else
you need,

20:38.005 --> 20:40.775
please don't hesitate
to come downstairs and grab it.

20:40.808 --> 20:42.409
Gee, thanks.

20:44.512 --> 20:46.246
Have a sexy stay with us.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.750
Ugh!

20:49.050 --> 20:50.218
Oh, God.

20:50.952 --> 20:52.186
Ugh!

20:54.922 --> 20:55.790
Damon?

20:55.823 --> 20:57.725
Ugh, yeah. But I'm
not gonna answer it.

20:57.759 --> 21:00.094
He's just gonna yell at me
for something I didn't do.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.462
I swear
I'm a pretty good girlfriend.

21:02.496 --> 21:04.732
You know what?
This is bullshit.

21:04.766 --> 21:06.801
You guys have been dating
for, like, two months,

21:06.834 --> 21:08.703
and most of it has been
long distance.

21:08.736 --> 21:10.403
This is supposed to be
the honeymoon phase.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.672
I know.

21:11.706 --> 21:14.742
Ugh. I should say something,
literally anything.

21:14.776 --> 21:16.409
What's the name of the thing
you were here to see?

21:16.443 --> 21:18.946
You know, you should really be with
someone who's not so controlling.

21:18.980 --> 21:21.549
Says the most
controlling person I know.

21:21.582 --> 21:22.917
I resent that.

21:35.096 --> 21:38.465
Law and Justice SVU,
<i>the unauthorized parody musical?</i>

21:38.498 --> 21:40.268
Are you fucking serious,
Brooklyn?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.170
But you love <i>Law and Justice.</i>

21:42.203 --> 21:43.436
It's your ringtone.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.740
Yeah, for when my mom calls.
That doesn't mean I like it.

21:45.773 --> 21:47.074
She reminds me
of a prosecutor,

21:47.108 --> 21:48.910
cross-examining me
all the fucking time.

21:48.943 --> 21:51.478
Well, at least there's a bar.
That's a good sign.

21:52.880 --> 21:57.251
Kids today, they don't
appreciate the classics, man.

21:57.285 --> 21:59.386
Totally, man.

22:00.855 --> 22:02.990
Do you guys have tickets?

22:04.457 --> 22:06.160
I mean, you don't need tickets

22:06.194 --> 22:08.262
because it's definitely
not sold out,

22:08.296 --> 22:09.931
but if you have tickets,

22:09.964 --> 22:11.966
my boss likes me
to mark it down.

22:11.999 --> 22:14.735
Okay, we should be
on Christian Jones' list.

22:14.769 --> 22:18.072
Okay. Go on in and find a seat.

22:18.105 --> 22:20.675
Wait, there's not, like,
reserved seating?

22:20.708 --> 22:23.544
No, man. Just grab
a free seat.

22:23.578 --> 22:26.413
Okay, well, where is the bar?

22:26.446 --> 22:30.318
Oh, look, Hannah, they have
your favorite, Bloody Mary.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.588
I love Bloody Marys!
Yes.

22:33.621 --> 22:35.156
Fine, I guess I'll have one.

22:35.189 --> 22:37.892
I mean, I can't pass up
a $5 Bloody Mary.

22:37.925 --> 22:40.294
I know.
Two Bloody Marys, please.

22:40.328 --> 22:42.597
Um, are you sure you don't...
You don't want four?

22:42.630 --> 22:44.464
Four? Double fisting?

22:44.497 --> 22:45.933
I like the way you think.

22:45.967 --> 22:48.169
Four Bloody Marys, please.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.770
Friends are coming, so...

22:49.804 --> 22:51.639
We thought we'd get
some for our friends.

22:51.672 --> 22:52.673
They're not coming.

22:52.707 --> 22:54.141
Want a wiener in your drink?

22:54.175 --> 22:55.977
Okay, that's disgusting.
You're gonna have to pay for that.

22:56.010 --> 22:58.779
Oh!

23:03.651 --> 23:05.853
Oh, good. There's people here.

23:05.887 --> 23:07.722
Yeah, shocking.

23:07.755 --> 23:09.790
Looks like everyone in here
is missing a chromosome.

23:09.824 --> 23:11.292
Shh, be nice.

23:11.325 --> 23:13.294
- Grab a seat, would ya?
- This row?

23:13.327 --> 23:14.762
Yeah, that looks good.

23:21.636 --> 23:23.771
Well, no cup holders.

23:23.804 --> 23:25.239
They couldn't afford
colored programs?

23:25.273 --> 23:27.074
I thought this was
a part of Comic Con.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.176
It's supposed to be.

23:29.210 --> 23:31.879
I don't know, maybe it is.
Maybe they just cut costs.

23:31.913 --> 23:34.348
Oh, yeah, and they used all
their cash on a seating chart

23:34.382 --> 23:35.616
and special effects team.

23:35.650 --> 23:37.518
In fact, I may Yelp about it.

23:37.551 --> 23:39.787
It's not that bad.

23:39.820 --> 23:42.023
It's a no for me, dawg. Ugh!

23:42.056 --> 23:44.292
I'm really gonna need
these Bloody Marys.

23:44.325 --> 23:48.195
Oh! I found his name
in the program. Look.

23:48.229 --> 23:51.065
"Christian Jones,
Detective Stabbler.

23:51.098 --> 23:54.402
"In his free time, Christian likes
to explore his passion for song

23:54.434 --> 23:55.937
"and grooving to Nickelback

23:55.970 --> 23:58.471
"with his goldendoodle
James Taylor."

23:59.507 --> 24:01.776
Ah, that's so cute.

24:01.809 --> 24:03.978
You know, if he has a pet,

24:04.011 --> 24:05.880
that means he's good
at relationships.

24:05.913 --> 24:07.648
- If he's good at relationships.
- Boy.

24:07.682 --> 24:09.050
Did you say Nickelback?

24:09.083 --> 24:11.619
I literally unfriended anybody
who like them on Facebook.

24:11.652 --> 24:14.454
Admitting you like them is like
admitting you like Donald Trump.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.623
It's social suicide.

24:15.656 --> 24:18.392
And why is the "S"
in "song" capitalized?

24:18.426 --> 24:19.627
Shh. It's starting.

24:19.660 --> 24:22.129
Wow,
I can hardly contain my excitement.

24:22.163 --> 24:23.664
Perhaps later you would
like to reminisce

24:23.698 --> 24:25.533
about 3 Doors Down
or Creed maybe.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.969
I like Creed.

24:39.847 --> 24:42.183
Hear ye, hear ye!

24:42.216 --> 24:44.819
It's been a long journey
back from the countryside

24:44.852 --> 24:46.988
where I was taking a trip.

24:47.021 --> 24:50.558
I took a good old Greyhound
up to New York City

24:50.591 --> 24:52.159
where the crime rate is high,

24:52.193 --> 24:54.996
and the apartment rentals
are pretty darn steep.

24:55.029 --> 24:57.365
It's like the Oregon Trail
brought before my very eyes.

24:57.398 --> 25:01.435
- Oh, my God.
- It was there that I came across the most valuable players

25:01.469 --> 25:04.038
in the criminal justice system.

25:04.472 --> 25:05.339

27:31.952 --> 27:34.421
Thank God
for those Bloody Marys.

27:34.455 --> 27:36.924
I could really use a cigarette.

27:36.957 --> 27:40.394
And in all actuality, I'm pretty
sure that was only like an hour.

27:40.427 --> 27:42.329
Time off for good behavior?

27:42.363 --> 27:44.398
Um, excuse me, do you have
any cigarettes?

27:45.766 --> 27:46.934
Ew, guess not.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.669
Oh, God, that's nasty.

27:48.702 --> 27:51.138
Maybe he's trying to help
the environment like Leo.

27:51.172 --> 27:52.940
Stripping the streets
of San Diego

27:52.973 --> 27:54.675
one cigarette butt at a time.

27:54.708 --> 27:56.177
Hmm. Just to be clear,

27:56.210 --> 27:57.546
I would totally smoke
Leo's butt.

27:57.579 --> 27:59.780
- I'll bet.
- I didn't mean it like that.

27:59.813 --> 28:01.482
Good tidings,
fellow theater-goers.

28:01.516 --> 28:03.585
Do either of you happen
to have a cigarette

28:03.618 --> 28:04.685
we could bum, perchance?

28:04.718 --> 28:06.420
Why are you talking
like the old man in the play?

28:06.453 --> 28:08.088
I don't know, I feel like
I have to talk like them.

28:08.122 --> 28:09.823
- They can hear you.
- We don't smoke.

28:09.857 --> 28:11.492
No, you know what?
I might, actually.

28:11.526 --> 28:15.129
Um, I confiscated some
at school earlier.

28:15.496 --> 28:16.363
Yeah.

28:17.164 --> 28:18.766
Thank you, good sir.

28:18.799 --> 28:20.701
Are you a student or a teacher?

28:20.734 --> 28:22.069
Do you need a hall pass?

28:24.138 --> 28:26.106
I... I teach science.

28:26.140 --> 28:27.609
Yeah. And he just got out.

28:27.642 --> 28:28.543
Of prison?

28:28.577 --> 28:30.077
The marines, actually.

28:30.110 --> 28:31.946
Two tours in Iraq, one in Syria.

28:31.979 --> 28:33.080
Oh, wow.

28:33.113 --> 28:35.816
Um, apologies on behalf
of my friend here.

28:35.849 --> 28:37.519
And we thank you
for your service.

28:38.352 --> 28:39.353
Thank you.

28:39.386 --> 28:40.522
<i>Semper fi.</i>

28:41.989 --> 28:43.457
Hmm.

28:43.490 --> 28:44.559
Cool backpack.

28:44.593 --> 28:46.160
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

28:46.193 --> 28:49.096
They were giving them out at the <i>Kanye vs.
Predator</i> exhibit. You guys going?

28:49.129 --> 28:50.731
Oh, yeah. My friend's
in the show.

28:50.764 --> 28:52.166
He plays Detective Stabbler.

28:52.199 --> 28:53.734
He'll probably hook us up
with some passes.

28:53.767 --> 28:55.236
What? That's so cool.

28:55.269 --> 28:56.870
You guys know
someone from the show?

28:56.904 --> 28:58.339
Uh-huh. Yeah.

28:58.372 --> 29:00.675
So what are you guys
supposed to be anyway?

29:00.709 --> 29:02.076
- Oh, uh...
- You go first.

29:02.109 --> 29:04.211
Yeah? All right. Well.

29:04.245 --> 29:07.549
I'm Septa Unella.

29:07.582 --> 29:08.816
From <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

29:10.017 --> 29:11.318
Shame!

29:11.352 --> 29:12.353
Shame!

29:12.654 --> 29:13.655
Shame!

29:14.288 --> 29:15.990
Shame!

29:16.023 --> 29:18.660
Sha... It's a character
from <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

29:18.693 --> 29:19.561
And I'm Hodor...

29:20.562 --> 29:21.862
Holding Bran.

29:23.163 --> 29:24.566
Oh, how clever!

29:24.599 --> 29:25.466
Well...

29:26.000 --> 29:26.900
Yeah.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.269
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:30.004 --> 29:31.438
Are you girls models, or...

29:31.472 --> 29:35.175
Oh, I'm actually what people
would call an influencer,

29:35.209 --> 29:37.244
which basically means
I'm famous.

29:37.278 --> 29:39.880
But I also do a blog
and styling.

29:39.913 --> 29:43.150
My passion is screenwriting,
but I cook and I have a podcast.

29:43.183 --> 29:45.819
- I have a lot of talents.
- Wow.

29:45.853 --> 29:47.756
What do you do
for money, though?

29:47.821 --> 29:49.790
Mom? Mom? Are you there?

29:49.823 --> 29:51.559
I'm a conscious cuddler.

29:51.593 --> 29:52.993
Basically, I take people

29:53.027 --> 29:54.862
who've experienced
high levels of trauma

29:54.895 --> 29:56.196
and I cuddle
the shit out of them.

29:56.230 --> 29:57.898
And I'm empathetic
and shit like that.

29:57.931 --> 29:58.899
It's actually quite lucrative.

29:58.932 --> 30:00.568
Does it work for PTSD?

30:00.602 --> 30:02.671
Oh, yeah. I get
all kinds of weirdos.

30:04.138 --> 30:06.040
Um, what about you?

30:06.073 --> 30:07.742
We just moved from New York
two weeks ago.

30:07.776 --> 30:11.879
She's a former reality starlet
turned aspiring film producer.

30:11.912 --> 30:13.280
Wow, what show?

30:13.314 --> 30:15.684
Um, I don't really wanna
talk about it.

30:15.717 --> 30:17.351
It's called
the <i>Parsippany-Troy Hills.</i>

30:17.384 --> 30:18.819
It's basically
like <i>Jersey Shore,</i>

30:18.852 --> 30:21.088
but it's set out of
a flip flop shop in Parsippany.

30:21.121 --> 30:23.324
Just to be clear,
I'm not from Parsippany.

30:25.527 --> 30:26.695
Hi!

30:26.728 --> 30:27.762
Brooklyn.

30:27.796 --> 30:30.030
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
I almost didn't see you.

30:30.064 --> 30:31.999
I was so busy talking
to my new friends.

30:32.032 --> 30:34.736
It's so great to see you.
What did you think of the show?

30:34.769 --> 30:37.237
I loved the show.
The show was...

30:37.271 --> 30:39.574
- Amazing. Right, Hannah?
- Mmm!

30:39.607 --> 30:40.841
You remember Hannah?

30:40.874 --> 30:42.610
I think so. You ladies were
in the same class in LaGuardia.

30:42.644 --> 30:43.611
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

30:43.645 --> 30:46.347
So, what was your
favorite part of the show?

30:46.380 --> 30:48.082
Oh, definitely
the Japanese water torture.

30:48.115 --> 30:49.149
Chinese.

30:49.183 --> 30:50.317
- Oh.
- It was Chinese.

30:50.351 --> 30:52.853
Chinese water torture.

30:52.886 --> 30:55.089
And then they started singing
about sexual assault.

30:55.122 --> 30:56.558
It's such a powerful topic.

30:56.591 --> 30:59.293
Yeah, "torture" is definitely
a word that came to mind.

30:59.326 --> 31:01.395
You know, that's
one of my favorite scenes.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.598
It really makes you feel...

31:10.304 --> 31:11.639
You know what I mean?

31:11.673 --> 31:12.841
- Yeah.
- Hannah, what about you?

31:12.873 --> 31:14.576
What was your favorite part
of my performance?

31:14.609 --> 31:18.078
I... There's just so many,
I don't know that I could tell you.

31:18.112 --> 31:19.446
I know, right? But pick one.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.382
Yeah, Hannah, pick one!

31:21.415 --> 31:24.084
Well, I really loved the part
where you and the lady cop

31:24.118 --> 31:26.420
sang about friendship
in the workplace.

31:26.453 --> 31:27.689
I wish I had friends at work.

31:27.722 --> 31:30.558
Oh, and <i>Splooge in her Kooter</i>
was a great song.

31:30.592 --> 31:31.726
- Yes.
- Yeah.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.596
You know, I've always thought
police officers were so...

31:34.629 --> 31:36.831
Sexy and powerful.

31:38.332 --> 31:40.334
Great show, Christian.

31:40.367 --> 31:42.570
Thanks, Treasure,
so good to see you.

31:42.604 --> 31:45.139
I'm gonna wait inside
and get something from the bar.

31:45.172 --> 31:46.206
I think that's a great idea.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.374
I'll be in in just a minute.

31:47.408 --> 31:48.909
I'm just saying hello
to some old friends.

31:50.911 --> 31:51.846
'Kay.

31:52.580 --> 31:53.848
'Kay.

31:53.882 --> 31:56.818
Hey, you guys wanna hear
some <i>Law and Justice</i> humor?

31:56.851 --> 31:58.085
Hey, you know what, I'm sorry,

31:58.118 --> 31:59.521
I actually have to
go back in and strike,

31:59.554 --> 32:01.121
tonight being
our last show and all.

32:01.155 --> 32:02.923
Why don't you ladies pop in
for a quick drink

32:02.956 --> 32:04.759
if you're finished talking
with these fine gents.

32:04.793 --> 32:07.394
- Yeah, sounds like a plan.
- All right.

32:10.698 --> 32:12.332
- All right, excuse me.
- All right.

32:12.366 --> 32:13.467
- All right.
- Okay.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.669
Okay.

32:14.702 --> 32:17.204
Last show? I thought
this was the only show.

32:18.472 --> 32:20.107
Don't fuck this up for me
with your negativity.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.376
You know what?
We actually have to go.

32:22.409 --> 32:25.412
Tomorrow we've got
some latex to set,

32:25.446 --> 32:27.181
and it takes so...
It's a process.

32:27.214 --> 32:28.683
Maybe we'll see you guys there.

32:28.716 --> 32:30.752
- Maybe.
- Yeah, yeah. For sure.

32:30.785 --> 32:32.654
All right. Okay.

32:32.687 --> 32:35.088
You know what? Uh, you should
have the backpack.

32:35.122 --> 32:36.256
- You should have it.
- Oh, no.

32:36.290 --> 32:37.659
'Cause it'll look better on you.

32:37.692 --> 32:40.327
And they're giving out a...
They're giving out a ton...

32:40.360 --> 32:42.095
Oh, you know, I don't need that.

32:42.129 --> 32:43.497
- I don't need it.
- No, I insist.

32:43.531 --> 32:44.498
I'll take the backpack.

32:44.532 --> 32:45.966
- Take the backpack.
- Thank you.

32:45.999 --> 32:47.034
No. No, big deal.

32:47.067 --> 32:48.335
- Thanks. See ya.
- All right.

32:48.368 --> 32:51.972
What? She... She looked like
she wanted it.

32:52.005 --> 32:53.240
That's
fucking hideous.

32:53.273 --> 32:54.542
It's fucking rad and I like it.

32:54.576 --> 32:56.611
You put me through this shit,
I get the backpack.

33:00.380 --> 33:01.850
Hey, Mr. Bartender.

33:01.883 --> 33:04.919
Hey. Well, I don't have
much left in terms of drinks.

33:04.953 --> 33:07.421
But I can make you ladies
a couple double vodka Red Bulls.

33:07.454 --> 33:09.189
Sounds good to me.

33:09.223 --> 33:11.124
You know that stuff
makes us a little wild.

33:11.158 --> 33:13.093
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:13.126 --> 33:14.127
Here you go.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.028
Thanks.

33:16.063 --> 33:17.097
<i>Chindon.</i>

33:17.130 --> 33:18.065
<i>Salud.</i>

33:18.098 --> 33:19.399
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

33:22.770 --> 33:25.405
You know, I'm so stoked
you ladies enjoyed the show.

33:25.439 --> 33:27.809
As you know, I've been
acting in film for a while,

33:27.842 --> 33:30.845
but I feel like now the theater
is calling my name.

33:30.879 --> 33:32.312
Oh, yeah. Sounds like it.

33:32.346 --> 33:35.115
It's like when I was playing
assassin number two in <i>Tower Heist.</i>

33:35.148 --> 33:37.317
Ben Stiller turned to me
and he said,

33:37.351 --> 33:38.753
"I bet you'd be great
in the theater."

33:38.786 --> 33:40.955
Oh, my goodness,
that's impressive.

33:40.989 --> 33:42.456
Right? It's like...

33:42.489 --> 33:44.859
<i>♪ When you've been
given the gift</i>

33:44.893 --> 33:47.327
<i>♪ Of song</i>

33:47.361 --> 33:50.264
<i>♪ It seems so wrong... ♪</i>

33:50.297 --> 33:52.099
Not to be bestow it
upon the people.

33:53.935 --> 33:55.537
Ben Stiller knows.

33:55.570 --> 33:57.337
It takes talent
to recognize talent.

33:57.605 --> 33:58.640
Totally.

33:58.673 --> 34:00.708
Are we really talking
about Zoolander right now?

34:00.742 --> 34:01.609
Can he even sing?

34:01.643 --> 34:02.911
Well, feel free
to finish your drinks.

34:02.944 --> 34:04.879
And I hope you ladies
enjoy San Diego.

34:04.913 --> 34:07.347
Oh, so you're taking off?

34:07.381 --> 34:08.583
That's a shocker.

34:08.616 --> 34:09.918
Well, you know,
few of the fellas

34:09.951 --> 34:12.119
and valued cast members
are going out on this yacht.

34:12.152 --> 34:15.890
I would invite you ladies, I really
would, but there just... Just isn't room.

34:15.924 --> 34:18.960
Oh. That's fine, I guess.

34:18.993 --> 34:21.829
Yeah, sounds like space would be
really tight on a yacht.

34:21.863 --> 34:24.164
Yes. Treasure's ex-husband
owns it.

34:24.197 --> 34:26.366
He's a bigwig at Google.

34:27.501 --> 34:29.837
Sounds positively teensy.

34:29.871 --> 34:32.674
But you're gonna get us passes
to Comic Con, right?

34:32.707 --> 34:35.309
- And we'll see you later, right?
- Possibly.

34:35.342 --> 34:36.878
My plans are a little up
in the air right now,

34:36.911 --> 34:39.981
but I gotta spend a little time
with the <i>Law and Justice</i> fam.

34:40.014 --> 34:42.884
In regards to the passes
for the convention center...

34:42.917 --> 34:45.587
I'd get you passes,
I really would, but the truth is

34:45.620 --> 34:48.488
I don't have any,
because technically...

34:49.189 --> 34:51.059
This isn't a Comic Con event.

34:51.091 --> 34:52.627
No shit.

34:52.660 --> 34:54.896
So, you're just gonna leave?

34:54.929 --> 34:56.263
Oh, no, I'm gonna
finish this drink,

34:56.296 --> 34:57.532
and then I'm gonna leave.

34:57.565 --> 34:59.266
So, what you're saying is
you don't have passes

34:59.299 --> 35:02.302
and we drove three hours to
technically not go to Comic Con?

35:02.336 --> 35:04.237
So great to see you ladies.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.139
Oh, and you know,
I'm up for the dad

35:06.173 --> 35:07.709
in <i>Dirty Dancing: The Musical.</i>

35:07.742 --> 35:10.044
And it's a national tour,
so I'm gonna be pretty...

35:12.013 --> 35:13.347
I'm gonna be pretty busy.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.916
But hopefully,
we can reconnect in LA,

35:14.949 --> 35:16.884
and maybe I can get you in
for a rehearsal.

35:16.918 --> 35:21.188
I mean, like, nobody puts baby
in a corner, right?

35:21.221 --> 35:22.590
Yeah, sure.

35:23.256 --> 35:24.124
Be safe.

35:24.424 --> 35:25.660
Bye...

35:28.763 --> 35:29.764
Uh...

35:30.364 --> 35:31.431
Hmm.

35:34.569 --> 35:36.571
Can you believe
that fucking guy?

35:36.604 --> 35:39.272
"There's not enough room
on a yacht."

35:39.306 --> 35:40.708
You gotta be joking.

35:40.742 --> 35:44.012
Well, at least we got
this dope-ass backpack now.

35:44.045 --> 35:45.847
I feel like I'm one of them.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.482
A nerd, Brooklyn,
I'm blending in.

35:48.516 --> 35:50.518
I love it!

35:50.551 --> 35:51.986
Like, what are we
supposed to do now?

35:52.020 --> 35:54.321
I drove three and a half hours
for me not to get a boyfriend,

35:54.354 --> 35:55.690
and not to get fucked.

35:55.723 --> 35:57.025
Like he was ever gonna be
your boyfriend.

35:57.058 --> 35:59.292
He's just some loser PE teacher
who played

35:59.326 --> 36:02.096
assassin number something in
some movie that nobody ever saw.

36:02.130 --> 36:03.665
Well, actually, now
that I think about it,

36:03.698 --> 36:05.633
Damon and I saw it, and I
don't recall him being in it.

36:05.667 --> 36:06.968
But that's not the point.

36:07.001 --> 36:09.037
You were probably too busy
sucking his dick to notice.

36:09.771 --> 36:11.539
He could've been my boyfriend.

36:11.572 --> 36:12.974
He was giving me
all the right signals.

36:13.007 --> 36:15.242
He was flirting with me...
Like, do I look bad?

36:15.275 --> 36:16.476
No. Jesus!

36:16.511 --> 36:18.112
Why is this always about you?

36:18.146 --> 36:20.715
We look hot, and we didn't come
all this fucking way

36:20.748 --> 36:22.150
to sit on our asses
with the cast

36:22.182 --> 36:23.618
of some shitty parody musical

36:23.651 --> 36:25.385
that shouldn't even be
a musical.

36:25.419 --> 36:27.320
I mean, who sings songs
about rape kits?

36:27.354 --> 36:28.856
Who writes this shit?

36:29.489 --> 36:30.792
I guess you're right.

36:32.026 --> 36:33.393
Well, what do
you wanna do, then?

36:33.427 --> 36:35.730
I don't really wanna go back
to our bum hotel.

36:35.763 --> 36:37.431
Let's get white girl wasted.

36:37.464 --> 36:40.101
Fuck these losers,
fuck these stupid men.

36:40.134 --> 36:41.468
They're a waste of our time.

36:41.501 --> 36:43.905
This is all about
female empowerment!

36:45.740 --> 36:48.475
Wow, you're bordering
out of control.

36:48.509 --> 36:50.745
It's like I'm looking in the
mirror, and I'm seeing myself.

36:51.311 --> 36:52.479

36:52.513 --> 36:54.849
I kinda like it.

37:35.455 --> 37:37.290
I love your outfit.

37:37.324 --> 37:39.493
You have sensational style.

37:39.527 --> 37:41.062
I don't think he's gonna
let us in, Brooklyn.

37:41.095 --> 37:42.630
Maybe we should go
somewhere else.

37:42.663 --> 37:44.264
Of course he will.
I love the gays.

37:44.297 --> 37:45.600
All my best friends are gay.

37:45.633 --> 37:47.467
I was on the Kiehl's
Gay Pride float

37:47.501 --> 37:49.469
for the past four years
in a row, Hannah.

37:49.504 --> 37:51.304
I'm basically
an honorary gay man.

37:51.338 --> 37:52.439
Whatever you say.

37:52.472 --> 37:53.775
Can I help you?

37:53.808 --> 37:54.509
Hi! Yes.

37:54.542 --> 37:56.511
There are two of us.

37:56.544 --> 37:57.645
Are you a model?

37:57.678 --> 37:59.247
I swear I've seen you before.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.748
Maybe Twist in Miami?

38:00.782 --> 38:03.785
Yeah, you two need to
get in line. Thanks.

38:03.818 --> 38:05.352
And you can't
bring that in here.

38:05.385 --> 38:06.587
Because it may
contain contraband?

38:06.621 --> 38:07.655
Mmm-hmm, because it's hideous.

38:07.688 --> 38:09.389
But it was a gift to us.

38:09.422 --> 38:10.958
Kind sir, what is your name?

38:10.992 --> 38:11.926
Reggie.

38:11.959 --> 38:15.328
Reggie, we drove
all the way from Los Angeles

38:15.362 --> 38:18.065
to go on a date with a guy
who basically ditched us.

38:18.099 --> 38:19.700
I just wanna go in there
and charge my phone.

38:19.734 --> 38:21.969
Fine. Whatever.

38:22.003 --> 38:23.671
Just see the cashier
on your left.

38:24.172 --> 38:25.173
Cashier?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.908
We have to pay?

38:26.941 --> 38:28.810
No. I think
you misunderstood.

38:28.843 --> 38:31.979
I think it's a $10 cover. Each.

38:32.013 --> 38:33.047
Ten dollars?

38:33.080 --> 38:34.749
Dude, come on. I don't wanna
keep walking around.

38:34.782 --> 38:36.017
My feet are starting to hurt.

38:36.050 --> 38:36.751
But, sir,

38:36.784 --> 38:38.920
or... Reggie.

38:38.953 --> 38:42.757
I've never paid to enter
any premises in my entire life.

38:42.790 --> 38:44.792
Usually people pay me
for my presence.

38:45.358 --> 38:46.627
I'm an influencer.

38:46.661 --> 38:49.297
Okay, that might work
in Los Angeles, ma'am,

38:49.329 --> 38:50.531
but this is San Diego.

38:50.565 --> 38:52.667
"Ma'am"?

38:52.700 --> 38:54.501
How old do you think I am?

38:54.535 --> 38:56.137
We're basically the same age!

38:56.170 --> 38:57.271
Okay.

38:57.305 --> 38:58.906
- Ugh!
- What's up, Reg?

38:58.940 --> 39:00.340
Hey, Ramon, how are you doing?

39:00.373 --> 39:01.876
You looking all flawed, man!

39:01.909 --> 39:04.411
Looking all Versace Hachi
right there, man.

39:04.444 --> 39:06.180
Stop it. Oh, my God.

39:06.214 --> 39:07.380
Oh, you shut up, man.

39:08.516 --> 39:10.117
Yo, these lovely ladies
are with us.

39:10.151 --> 39:11.185
You know I got tables.

39:11.919 --> 39:13.554
Hey, anything for you, Ramon.

39:13.588 --> 39:14.956
- You ready to go?
- Uh-huh.

39:16.290 --> 39:17.457
Do you see that?

39:17.490 --> 39:18.793
He called us "girls."

39:18.826 --> 39:21.662
I'm not a "ma'am." I'm not old!

39:21.696 --> 39:23.998
See if I see you on
the Kiehl's float next year.

39:24.031 --> 39:26.000
Hey, get inside
before I change my mind, ma'am.

39:34.976 --> 39:37.912
What the fuck
are these people on?

39:37.945 --> 39:40.848
Whatever it is, I hope
it makes them better looking.

39:40.882 --> 39:43.351
No wonder they have
that guy outside.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.186
It's false advertising.

39:45.219 --> 39:48.322
Yo, so many honeys
in this spot tonight.

39:48.356 --> 39:50.892
And we landed the baddest two
looking right here.

39:51.259 --> 39:52.193
Oh!

39:58.498 --> 39:59.934
Unbelievable!

39:59.967 --> 40:02.069
Let me introduce you
to my crew.

40:02.103 --> 40:03.436
This is Charlie,

40:03.470 --> 40:05.039
that's Tony Montana,

40:05.072 --> 40:06.007
that's TJ,

40:06.040 --> 40:08.441
and that's my boy, Playboy Adam.

40:10.111 --> 40:11.078
Hi.

40:11.112 --> 40:12.213
Ugh.

40:13.948 --> 40:15.650
Shot, shot, shot, shot!

40:15.683 --> 40:17.151
Load it up, load it up.

40:19.654 --> 40:20.922
I feel better.

40:34.101 --> 40:35.136
Hey.

40:35.169 --> 40:36.570
Hey. Hi!

40:36.604 --> 40:37.772
Hi!

40:37.805 --> 40:39.774
I'm so sorry, I know
this is, like, so random,

40:39.807 --> 40:40.875
but are you Hannah,

40:40.908 --> 40:42.543
from the <i>Parsippany-Troy Hills?</i>

40:42.576 --> 40:44.946
Oh, yeah. That's me.

40:44.979 --> 40:47.447
Yeah! Oh, my God, I told you!

40:47.480 --> 40:48.616
I told you it was her.

40:48.649 --> 40:51.484
Um, I'm Kelsey,
and this is my BFF, Delia.

40:51.519 --> 40:52.720
And we're like...

40:52.753 --> 40:55.323
We're like... We're huge fans.

40:55.356 --> 40:57.391
Oh, that's so sweet.

40:57.425 --> 40:59.459
I'm Hannah, obviously.

40:59.492 --> 41:01.228
And that's
my best friend Brooklyn.

41:01.262 --> 41:02.196
Oh, my God, hi!

41:02.229 --> 41:05.199
So, you're not based
in New Jersey?

41:05.232 --> 41:06.466
No, not anymore.

41:06.499 --> 41:09.203
We moved here officially from
New York a couple weeks ago.

41:09.236 --> 41:11.238
I'm getting into other sides
of production,

41:11.272 --> 41:13.441
and she's a blogger
and a screenwriter.

41:13.473 --> 41:14.508
Influencer.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.377
Awesome! You go, girl.

41:16.410 --> 41:17.511
That is so cool!

41:17.545 --> 41:19.914
Ladies, why don't you all come
join me and my boys?

41:19.947 --> 41:22.616
We have a ton of room.
Y'all can drink from my bottle.

41:22.650 --> 41:25.485
- What are you, like, a promoter?
- Promoter?

41:25.519 --> 41:27.388
I'm an entrepreneur, baby.

41:27.421 --> 41:28.622
God, no, this is good.

41:28.656 --> 41:29.724
Entrepreneur?

41:29.757 --> 41:31.092
Entrepreneur.

41:31.125 --> 41:34.428
Hey, so, can your friend
take a photo of us?

41:34.462 --> 41:36.697
I really... I wanna post it
on the 'Gram.

41:36.731 --> 41:38.799
- Sure.
- Oh, great. Great.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.334
Okay.

41:41.802 --> 41:42.970
Say cheese!

41:43.004 --> 41:45.139
<i>Parsippany Hills!</i>

41:45.673 --> 41:46.807
Cool?

41:46.841 --> 41:49.276
- Oh, my God, it's so good!
- Right?

41:49.310 --> 41:51.579
Maybe we can all take one
together, actually.

41:51.612 --> 41:54.281
Hashtag "more beautiful
in person"?

41:54.315 --> 41:56.684
I think actually
hashtag "new best friend."

41:56.717 --> 41:59.153
Yay! Oh, my God,
we're like besties now.

41:59.186 --> 42:00.921
Aren't you gonna introduce us
to your friends?

42:00.955 --> 42:02.089
Those aren't our friends.

42:02.123 --> 42:05.626
I'm Kelsey and this is Delia.

42:05.659 --> 42:07.194
Um, hey, look.

42:07.228 --> 42:08.963
I'm sorry, I know
this is very...

42:08.996 --> 42:11.065
You're like, "Who is this girl?"

42:11.098 --> 42:13.901
but do you wanna go to
another, another bar?

42:13.934 --> 42:16.470
I mean,
these guys are, like, lame!

42:16.505 --> 42:19.040
And I'm pretty sure that one of them
is, like, a drug dealer.

42:19.073 --> 42:20.509
Something we can all agree.

42:20.541 --> 42:21.942
Uh, I mean, yeah.

42:21.976 --> 42:24.712
Yeah, I guess.
Uh, what do you think, B?

42:24.745 --> 42:26.914
And leave
our awesome benefactors?

42:26.947 --> 42:28.349
Gee, I'm not sure.

42:28.849 --> 42:30.084
What's up, baby,

42:30.117 --> 42:32.053
you still giving that lap dance
you promised me?

42:33.187 --> 42:35.122
You know what, I'm ready to dip.

42:35.156 --> 42:37.558
Pretty sure I saw that guy
slip something in your drink.

42:37.591 --> 42:39.960
So, um...

42:39.994 --> 42:42.163
I'm really sorry, but we're
gonna have to get going.

42:42.196 --> 42:44.365
My herpes is
starting to flare up.

42:44.398 --> 42:45.299
Sorry, guys.

42:45.332 --> 42:47.601
Yo, I got it, too.
Don't worry about that.

42:47.635 --> 42:48.869
Where are they going?

42:48.903 --> 42:50.171
They're going to the bathroom.
Now you done scared them, man.

42:50.204 --> 42:52.039
They were smoking hot, for real.

42:52.073 --> 42:54.842
Man, I got a pack of rhino pills
ready to use.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.278
Ugh,
are we almost there?

42:57.311 --> 42:59.413
My feet hurt,
and I need a Band-Aid.

42:59.447 --> 43:01.882
When my feet were bothering me,
you didn't care.

43:01.916 --> 43:03.384
It's just up the street.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.653
Yeah, it's just
up the street so... Hannah,

43:05.686 --> 43:07.121
what's it like being famous?

43:07.154 --> 43:08.523
Do you just get everything
that you want?

43:08.557 --> 43:11.125
I mean, it's not really
much of anything, to be honest.

43:11.158 --> 43:12.760
It's been a really long time.

43:12.793 --> 43:15.329
Well, it's gotta be
awesome, right?

43:15.362 --> 43:18.265
What happened with Gino?
Is he still your boyfriend?

43:18.299 --> 43:21.102
No, she dates a real winner now.

43:21.135 --> 43:22.002
Damon.

43:22.036 --> 43:23.137
Damon the demon.

43:23.170 --> 43:25.673
No, Gino and I broke up
a while ago.

43:25.706 --> 43:27.074
Actually, he's gay,

43:27.108 --> 43:29.343
and the producer just wanted us
to pretend like we dated.

43:29.376 --> 43:30.611
No way!

43:30.644 --> 43:31.846
Stop!

43:31.879 --> 43:34.215
I totally thought
he was gay TBH,

43:34.248 --> 43:36.917
because, like, the way he talked
about the thong-toed sandals.

43:36.951 --> 43:38.919
I was like... I know.

43:38.953 --> 43:41.255
Did she just say "TBH"
like it was an actual word?

43:41.288 --> 43:43.023
Hey, but your new boyfriend

43:43.057 --> 43:44.959
has gotta be like super dreamy.

43:44.992 --> 43:46.561
I mean, look at you,
you're such a catch,

43:46.595 --> 43:48.129
and you're all famous and stuff.

43:48.162 --> 43:50.698
Yeah, why haven't we seen him
on your IG account?

43:50.731 --> 43:52.366
Yeah, how come?

43:52.399 --> 43:54.902
Uh, he doesn't like me to post photos
of us together on the Internet.

43:54.935 --> 43:57.438
And besides, I'm a pretty
private person, so...

43:57.471 --> 44:00.674
- Yeah, totally, that's it.
- Just shut up already, Brooklyn!

44:00.708 --> 44:01.742
He's okay.

44:01.775 --> 44:03.144
He's just
a little controlling...

44:03.177 --> 44:04.678
And it's only
because he loves me.

44:04.712 --> 44:07.114
And he's acting,
and it's not good for his image.

44:07.148 --> 44:08.749
That's what he said
his manager said.

44:08.782 --> 44:13.187
His manager at Sky Bar,
where he works every night?

44:13.220 --> 44:15.557
Um, do either of you ladies
have a boyfriend?

44:15.590 --> 44:18.392
Yeah, actually, that's
where we're going right now.

44:18.893 --> 44:20.494
His name's Andrew,

44:20.529 --> 44:23.030
and he works at this really cool
bar up here. It's, like, hella cool.

44:23.063 --> 44:24.298
- Oh, nice.
- Super cool.

44:24.331 --> 44:26.100
Yeah. And, you know,
he's actually an actor, too.

44:26.133 --> 44:27.735
And he's researching
for this, like,

44:27.768 --> 44:29.403
really big movie
role right now

44:29.436 --> 44:33.040
where he totally has to completely
ignore his girlfriend for research.

44:33.073 --> 44:35.510
Uh, how long has
he been researching?

44:35.544 --> 44:37.311
Um, three months.

44:37.344 --> 44:39.180
Yeah, he's really,
really dedicated.

44:39.213 --> 44:41.949
He's kind of like
Daniel Day-Lewis.

44:41.982 --> 44:44.218
Are you guys
seriously this naive?

44:44.586 --> 44:46.020
Oh, my God!

44:48.422 --> 44:53.427
Hey, babe! Babe!
Hi, babe! Hi.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.896
Is she having some
sort of muscle spasm?

44:55.930 --> 44:58.165
- Be nice.
- That's right.

44:58.199 --> 44:59.833
- What can I get you?
- What?

44:59.867 --> 45:01.368
No. Hello?

45:01.735 --> 45:03.137
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:03.170 --> 45:04.338
What can I get you?

45:04.371 --> 45:07.509
These are my friends, babe,
my new friends.

45:07.542 --> 45:10.110
Do you remember that
show <i>Parsippany-Troy Hills</i>

45:10.144 --> 45:12.313
that I was, like,
totally obsessed with?

45:12.346 --> 45:13.214
No.

45:14.081 --> 45:16.083
You're so silly.

45:16.116 --> 45:18.352
You're such a silly billy.
Of course you do.

45:18.385 --> 45:20.721
Remember Hannah?
She's here.

45:20.754 --> 45:22.624
I mean, isn't that wild?

45:22.657 --> 45:24.024
Can you even?

45:24.058 --> 45:26.460
- I can't even.
- I know, right?

45:26.493 --> 45:28.462
It's crazy.

45:29.897 --> 45:31.966
Anyway, I want to
buy them all a drink.

45:31.999 --> 45:35.069
And by "buy," you mean you want me
to give it to you for free, right?

45:37.805 --> 45:40.609
Oh, baby,
you're so funny.

45:40.642 --> 45:43.678
Don't make me go all
medieval on your ass.

45:45.479 --> 45:49.416
Baby. Honey? Baby.

45:51.485 --> 45:53.220
He's very busy,

45:53.254 --> 45:54.955
- but he'll be back.
- Yeah.

45:54.989 --> 45:56.290
He always comes back.

45:56.323 --> 45:59.026
- Always.
- It's a bar. He has to.

45:59.059 --> 46:00.461
No. No, it's not an issue.

46:00.494 --> 46:02.763
I should probably start
hydrating at this point anyway.

46:02.796 --> 46:05.132
I'm not a big drinker, so.

46:05.165 --> 46:07.801
You did not smash your phone
in a crime of passion.

46:07.835 --> 46:09.336
No, no, no.
That's nonsense.

46:09.370 --> 46:13.642
I'll get the girl bartender-ress.
She'll get us a drink.

46:13.675 --> 46:15.309
Girl, girl.

46:15.342 --> 46:16.611
Hi, girl.

46:16.645 --> 46:19.514
Can we have four shots for me and my...
Oh, that's so perfect.

46:19.547 --> 46:20.881
Thank you so much.

46:20.914 --> 46:22.149
Thank you.

46:22.182 --> 46:26.721
Oh, she recognized you.
We really should shift.

46:26.755 --> 46:28.556
- Here you go.
- Okay.

46:28.590 --> 46:32.527
- What should we cheers to?
- To friends.

46:32.560 --> 46:36.997
To best friends,
Hannah and Blankton.

46:37.031 --> 46:39.266
- It's Brooklyn.
- Right. Yeah, the blogger.

46:39.300 --> 46:41.835
- Influencer.
- Okay, just cheers.

46:42.704 --> 46:43.804
Cheers.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.840
- Oh.
- Ugh!

46:46.874 --> 46:47.841
Whoo!

46:47.875 --> 46:48.942
What was that?

46:48.976 --> 46:50.978
Oh, my God.
We have to take a picture.

46:51.011 --> 46:52.547
- Was that...
- We need a photo.

46:52.580 --> 46:55.949
- We look good.
- Good, is my poof okay?

46:56.917 --> 46:57.818
Oh, my God!

46:57.851 --> 46:59.688
I'm gonna caption
this one

46:59.721 --> 47:03.558
"hashtag, that shot life."

47:03.591 --> 47:06.327
But with the "Y"
but not an "I."

47:06.360 --> 47:08.697
That's so chill!
Nobody's ever done that.

47:08.730 --> 47:12.099
That's, like, the most
original thing I ever heard of.

47:12.132 --> 47:14.736
- Um, do you have to pee?
- I do have to pee.

47:14.769 --> 47:17.871
I have to pee so badly.
Do you guys have to pee?

47:17.905 --> 47:20.040
- I'm good.
- We'll just wait here.

47:20.074 --> 47:20.974
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:21.008 --> 47:22.544
Cool.
I'll miss you so much.

47:22.577 --> 47:24.579
- Bye.
- Bye.

47:25.179 --> 47:26.815
Oh, my God, dude.

47:26.847 --> 47:29.249
Those girls are
so fucking dumb.

47:29.283 --> 47:32.019
I came here to be with you,
not these fucking children.

47:32.052 --> 47:33.822
Oh, my God, stop.

47:33.854 --> 47:35.255
What, are you jealous

47:35.289 --> 47:37.991
that someone's actually giving me
attention for once instead of you?

47:38.025 --> 47:43.531
No, that's not it. I just...
I don't get you sometimes.

47:43.565 --> 47:46.867
You're the one who dragged me to
fucking San Diego in the first place.

47:46.900 --> 47:49.771
Now you're mad that I actually
scored us some plans?

47:49.804 --> 47:52.373
Like, I'm sorry that we didn't stay
to hang out with the drug dealers

47:52.406 --> 47:56.243
or go on some yacht to hang out with
the cast of <i>Shit Dick: The Musical.</i>

47:56.276 --> 47:58.011
You know what?
Whatever, Hannah.

47:58.045 --> 48:00.648
Why don't you just run along with your
little butt buddies to the bathroom?

48:00.682 --> 48:04.652
Maybe you could finger bang each other and
let them massage your massive ego some more.

48:04.686 --> 48:06.420
Relieve your glory days!

48:06.453 --> 48:08.922
You know what? Maybe I will.
Get it together.

48:08.956 --> 48:10.525
You're being a fucking bitch.

48:19.534 --> 48:23.137
- Can I buy you a drink?
- <i>Moi?</i>

48:23.170 --> 48:24.972
No, that girl
right behind you.

48:26.006 --> 48:28.041
Yeah, you.

48:28.075 --> 48:31.111
I'm flattered, but I would feel kind of weird
'cause I just came here with your girlfriend.

48:31.145 --> 48:32.913
- So...
- That's not my girlfriend.

48:32.946 --> 48:36.016
She's just some crazy desperate
chick who keeps showing up here.

48:36.049 --> 48:37.117
Occasionally we fuck.

48:37.151 --> 48:39.453
Oh, you have
a real way with words.

48:39.486 --> 48:42.022
Whatever. I'm honest.

48:42.055 --> 48:45.560
These girls are annoying as
all hell and you think so, too.

48:45.593 --> 48:48.429
- You don't know me.
- You want it or not.

48:48.462 --> 48:51.666
Fine.
But nothing dark, please,

48:51.699 --> 48:53.768
because I don't do well with
anything that's not clear.

48:54.268 --> 48:55.837
Whiskey it is, then.

48:55.870 --> 48:57.539
Oh, okay.

49:04.178 --> 49:05.979
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

49:10.150 --> 49:11.686
Ugh!

49:15.557 --> 49:16.691
Oh.

49:16.724 --> 49:18.492
And then he told me that
he liked my dog better than me

49:18.526 --> 49:20.662
because my dog didn't talk.

49:20.695 --> 49:23.665
- And I was like...
- They'll talk soon.

49:28.168 --> 49:29.938
What the fuck are you doing?

49:29.970 --> 49:32.105
- Just taking shots.
- Are you hitting on my man?

49:32.139 --> 49:33.373
Ew! Absolutely not.

49:33.407 --> 49:36.243
Yes, you are. I know when
you're hitting on my man

49:36.276 --> 49:37.512
and you're hitting
on him now.

49:37.545 --> 49:39.681
Trust me, I would never
hit on that guy.

49:39.714 --> 49:42.449
Nobody hits on my man
and gets away with it.

49:42.483 --> 49:44.485
- No, I'm sure she...
- No, don't get involved.

49:44.519 --> 49:45.986
She put the last girl
in the hospital.

49:46.019 --> 49:47.087
How many times
has this happened?

49:47.120 --> 49:48.989
What are you
gonna do about it? Huh?

49:49.022 --> 49:50.224
What you gonna do about it?

49:50.257 --> 49:52.560
For starters, he's clearly
not your boyfriend.

49:52.594 --> 49:55.195
He just said so.
Also, I think he's hideous.

49:55.229 --> 49:56.263
I only date hot guys.

49:56.296 --> 49:57.765
Oh, Jesus.
Here we go.

49:57.799 --> 49:58.666
You bitch.

50:00.100 --> 50:00.969
Oh!

50:04.639 --> 50:07.374
You better run,
you big titty, cocky...

50:07.407 --> 50:08.843
I'm going to call
the cops again.

50:08.877 --> 50:11.646
You better. With your
hair and your teeth...

50:11.679 --> 50:14.883
Go, go, go, go!
Holy shit!

50:14.916 --> 50:18.018
...doesn't look
like a face anymore.

50:18.051 --> 50:19.521
Why'd you have to
go and do that?

50:19.554 --> 50:22.055
I... I'm sorry, dude.

50:22.089 --> 50:24.391
Look, I didn't mean for you
to get punched in the face.

50:24.424 --> 50:25.627
That girl was out of line.

50:25.660 --> 50:27.294
You couldn't just let me
have more attention

50:27.327 --> 50:29.263
than you for five fucking
seconds, could you?

50:29.296 --> 50:31.365
You had to go and make
a goddamn scene.

50:31.398 --> 50:34.067
I'm sorry, okay?

50:34.101 --> 50:37.539
Look, to be fair, you took it like a champ.
Like Ronda Rousey.

50:37.572 --> 50:39.373
Except you didn't even
get knocked out.

50:39.807 --> 50:41.408
Thanks, I guess.

50:41.441 --> 50:45.279
Let me see you. All right.
It's not even that red yet.

50:45.312 --> 50:46.681
So there's that.

50:46.714 --> 50:49.082
Well, I feel like I just got
hit with a Mack truck.

50:49.116 --> 50:51.118
Hey, look,
there's a pedicab.

50:51.151 --> 50:52.954
Let's just take it
back to the hotel,

50:52.987 --> 50:56.456
have a couple beers from the
minibar, assuming there is a minibar.

50:56.490 --> 51:00.327
Otherwise, we'll just have more of
Borat's leftover champagne from the lobby.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.396
- Taxi!
- Taxi?

51:02.429 --> 51:04.231
It's better than
yelling "pedi."

51:04.264 --> 51:07.735
I'm only agreeing to this
because my face and my feet hurt.

51:07.769 --> 51:10.437
You know, I hate pedicabs.
Are they even legal anymore?

51:10.470 --> 51:12.674
Don't be such a pussy.

51:12.707 --> 51:14.374
Oh, God.

51:14.408 --> 51:17.612
- Hi.
- Hey, where you wanna go?

51:17.645 --> 51:21.916
We are going to
the Golden West or whatever.

51:21.950 --> 51:26.286
All right, just relax,
and we'll get you there soon.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.023
So how long
you've been a pedo?

51:29.057 --> 51:31.960
That is a very funny joke,
you terrible bitch.

No, this isn't right.

You said Golden West.
I brought you the Golden West.

52:30.384 --> 52:34.922
I think it's the wrong one.
I don't see the janky lights.

52:34.956 --> 52:37.491
Well, I don't know.
You asked me to bring you to Golden West,

52:37.525 --> 52:38.893
so here we are.

52:38.926 --> 52:41.495
We'll just call an Uber
when I charge my phone.

52:41.529 --> 52:43.163
All right. 50 bucks.

52:43.196 --> 52:44.932
- 50?
- Yeah.

52:44.966 --> 52:47.535
Fine.
Fuck it. Give him the money.

52:47.568 --> 52:49.202
Well, it's in the bag.

52:49.236 --> 52:50.905
I gave you the back, right?

52:50.938 --> 52:52.907
Yes, Brooklyn. I magically
grabbed the bag

52:52.940 --> 52:56.611
after I got fucking
pummeled in the face.

52:56.644 --> 53:02.784
Um, here's one dollar,
two dollars, three dollars.

53:02.817 --> 53:05.285
You know what?
Here's six dollars.

53:05.318 --> 53:07.454
Keep the imaginary change.

53:07.487 --> 53:09.057
Put that shit away.

53:09.090 --> 53:12.492
You give me $50 right now
or I'm calling the cops.

53:12.527 --> 53:15.328
Why is everyone so quick
to call the fuzz here?

53:15.362 --> 53:17.899
Look, sir, we left
our bag at the bar.

53:17.932 --> 53:20.500
- If you just turn it around, I'm sure we'll find it.
- Yeah.

53:20.535 --> 53:26.908
Listen, you stupid drunk and stupid
drunk girls, give me my money

53:26.941 --> 53:28.576
or you're going
to jail right now.

53:28.609 --> 53:31.179
Relax, Hannah.
He's not gonna call the cops.

53:31.211 --> 53:32.980
He doesn't have the balls.

53:36.684 --> 53:39.787
I can't believe Christian
doesn't like me.

53:39.821 --> 53:40.688
Like...

53:41.723 --> 53:44.692
I wasn't expecting
that at all.

53:44.726 --> 53:46.627
What kind of guy
invites you somewhere

53:46.661 --> 53:49.897
and then doesn't at least
give you a courtesy fuck?

53:50.497 --> 53:52.332
Men are so mean.

53:52.365 --> 53:54.501
Men could be
such assholes.

53:54.535 --> 53:56.436
Because of my looks?

53:56.470 --> 53:59.507
I can't imagine that
it would be, but is it?

53:59.540 --> 54:02.643
I bought this outfit
two hours before we left.

54:02.677 --> 54:03.978
Should I have worn
the purple pumps?

54:04.011 --> 54:06.714
Shut the fuck up, Brooklyn.
We're in prison.

54:06.748 --> 54:08.549
I've never been
in prison before.

54:08.583 --> 54:11.284
I don't even know how
this process works. Jesus!

54:12.385 --> 54:13.921
Oh, what's happening?

54:13.955 --> 54:15.757
- Are we being booked?
- No.

54:15.790 --> 54:20.260
That petty cab driver was wanted all over
town for selling counterfeit Prosecco.

54:20.293 --> 54:23.197
Turns out it was carbonated
formaldehyde or something.

54:23.231 --> 54:26.667
We've taken him into custody.
You're free to go.

54:28.936 --> 54:30.738
Oh, thank God.

54:40.480 --> 54:42.150
Thank you.

54:42.183 --> 54:44.619
Do you mind if I charge my phone
for a minute so we could get a ride?

54:44.652 --> 54:46.087
Sure.

54:47.387 --> 54:50.691
- Um, that outlet doesn't actually work.
- Oh, good.

54:50.725 --> 54:53.227
But I could charge it for you
at my desk for a second.

54:53.261 --> 54:55.730
Would you look at that.
Not all heroes wear capes.

54:55.763 --> 54:57.832
It sounds like you ladies
have had quite the night.

54:57.865 --> 54:59.834
We're visiting from LA.

54:59.867 --> 55:01.769
That's a pretty thick accent
for a California girl.

55:01.803 --> 55:05.807
Oh. She's originally from Jersey,
and I'm from New York. We just moved here.

55:05.840 --> 55:07.307
Where are we right now?

55:07.340 --> 55:08.543
We're in Encinitas.

55:08.576 --> 55:10.077
It's right outside
of San Diego.

55:10.111 --> 55:13.114
Brooklyn, doesn't Gordo
live in Encinitas?

55:13.147 --> 55:14.481
- Gordo?
- Yeah.

55:14.515 --> 55:17.618
That raver kid we met at Sidney's
house party years ago in SoHo.

55:17.652 --> 55:19.720
He DMed you on Facebook
all the time, right?

55:19.754 --> 55:22.056
Shit, you're right!
Why didn't I think of that?

55:22.089 --> 55:24.457
Ah, I should hit you
in the head more often.

55:24.491 --> 55:25.458
Inside joke.

55:25.492 --> 55:27.528
I'm going
text him right now.

55:27.562 --> 55:29.329
Yeah, I mean,
worth a shot, right?

55:29.362 --> 55:32.567
Hopefully we can make one more stop
before we head back to our actual hotel.

55:32.600 --> 55:34.501
Totally.

55:34.535 --> 55:36.204
Oh, that was quick.
He said, come over.

55:36.237 --> 55:38.940
Sweet. Maybe we will
actually have some fun.

55:38.973 --> 55:41.709
Yeah! They're probably
raging right now.

55:41.742 --> 55:44.377
Hey, if you want,
I can give you both a ride.

55:44.411 --> 55:45.980
Oh.

55:47.882 --> 55:50.585
Well, never ridden
in a cop car before.

55:50.618 --> 55:53.988
Well, hopefully there's a first
and a last time for everything.

55:54.454 --> 55:55.957
Where are we?

55:55.990 --> 55:58.391
Fuck if I know.
This place is weird.

55:58.425 --> 55:59.994
Are you sure this is right?

56:00.027 --> 56:02.495
According
to Google Maps, it is.

56:02.530 --> 56:04.866
I was expecting
more of a techno-y vibe.

56:04.899 --> 56:07.101
Wait, are they meditating?

56:07.134 --> 56:10.238
Okay, I'm really gonna need
this dose of rough first.

56:10.271 --> 56:11.772
Hey, where'd you get that?

56:11.806 --> 56:13.274
I stole it
from the police station.

56:13.307 --> 56:15.109
Oh, great. Petty larceny
from the police station.

56:15.142 --> 56:17.812
Hashtag, great choices, Hannah.

56:20.581 --> 56:23.050
Hannah. Brooklyn.

56:23.084 --> 56:26.520
Wow. It is so good
to see you guys.

56:26.554 --> 56:27.922
- Hi.
- Hey.

56:27.955 --> 56:29.857
Shh! Got to keep our
volume down, though,

56:29.891 --> 56:34.862
because if you look here, we're having
our nightly moon phase meditation.

56:34.896 --> 56:37.899
You know, that's much better.
Thank you. Come here.

56:37.932 --> 56:40.234
- You guys just...
- Oh, okay.

56:40.268 --> 56:42.069
You guys just look un...

56:42.103 --> 56:45.373
believable.
Flowers for the fortunate.

56:45.405 --> 56:47.241
- Oh, for me?
- For you.

56:47.275 --> 56:51.045
- Lemme see your hand.
- Ah! Spikes.

56:52.513 --> 56:54.081
What the fuck?

57:09.263 --> 57:12.733
I'm so sorry.

57:13.601 --> 57:16.771
Oh, okay. All right.

57:18.572 --> 57:21.042
- It's all love. You feel?
- Yeah.

57:21.075 --> 57:22.076
Captain.

57:22.109 --> 57:24.612
I want you to lead
the moon mass, <i>mon frere.</i>

57:24.645 --> 57:27.248
This is our
revolutionary coach.

57:27.281 --> 57:28.448
Also a roommate.

57:29.283 --> 57:31.986
- Duality, right?
- Yeah.

57:32.019 --> 57:33.154
Duality.

57:42.663 --> 57:44.165
Ooh, boobies.

57:44.198 --> 57:46.434
Oh, no, no, no.
We don't touch him.

57:46.466 --> 57:52.106
No, thank you so much. Yeah,
that is the sacred sanctum of our home.

57:52.139 --> 57:55.443
Captain's nipple god.
You heard of it?

57:55.475 --> 57:57.545
- Nipple god?
- Yeah.

57:58.145 --> 57:59.213
Nipple god.

57:59.246 --> 58:01.615
It's kind of like the mascot
here, you would say.

58:01.649 --> 58:06.554
Whenever we have any issues,
we just walk up to it and just stare.

58:09.724 --> 58:13.928
Yeah, I mean, it's funny.
He's always got the answers.

58:13.961 --> 58:15.830
He encourages
conscious calamity.

58:15.863 --> 58:19.467
- Calamity?
- Yeah, like calmness.

58:19.499 --> 58:20.701
That's what it means.

58:20.735 --> 58:22.636
Doesn't calamity
mean disaster?

58:22.670 --> 58:23.804
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

58:23.838 --> 58:27.641
Girls, I would like
to welcome you

58:27.675 --> 58:29.210
to the mystical mansion.

58:29.243 --> 58:31.979
Some of us call it
the productive palace

58:32.013 --> 58:34.348
or the spiritual sanctum.

58:34.382 --> 58:38.719
It's really,
I don't want to say radical,

58:38.753 --> 58:40.688
but I do want
to say radical.

58:40.721 --> 58:44.725
It feels like a really elevated
experience being here with you.

58:44.759 --> 58:47.528
So thanks for having us.
Cheers.

58:49.330 --> 58:50.564
No, no, no.

58:51.465 --> 58:52.533
Give me.

58:53.901 --> 58:56.804
We don't do this here.
This is way off brand.

58:56.837 --> 58:59.373
This is negative energy.

58:59.407 --> 59:00.474
No wings here.

59:00.509 --> 59:05.579
What we do do is SGC,
Spiritual Gangster Coffee.

59:05.613 --> 59:07.181
You feel me?

59:07.214 --> 59:09.150
Try some of that.
That's what we drink here in the house.

59:09.183 --> 59:11.018
Well, that
and, uh, nature's miracle.

59:11.619 --> 59:13.522
- GHB?
- Urine?

59:13.554 --> 59:15.189
- Water.
- Oh, of course.

59:16.657 --> 59:19.160
Um, what's "ghee"?

59:19.193 --> 59:20.928
I don't wanna ask
these people anything

59:20.961 --> 59:22.430
'cause I'm pretty sure
this is a cult.

59:22.997 --> 59:24.432
A friendly cult.

59:24.465 --> 59:28.369
I got to say, I was very
surprised to hear from you both.

59:29.437 --> 59:31.439
But you look good.

59:31.472 --> 59:33.874
- Been a long time.
- It has.

59:33.908 --> 59:37.178
- And you've changed quite a bit.
- Bit 'n about.

59:39.847 --> 59:41.115
Is there dairy in this?

59:41.148 --> 59:47.188
I was once like this cone,
you know, little prickly,

59:47.221 --> 59:50.024
not much going on, circular.

59:50.057 --> 59:54.295
But then I came here, and I just had
my surfboard and some good vibes.

59:54.328 --> 59:55.262
You feel?

59:55.296 --> 59:58.165
Met some like-hearted heroes
along the way.

59:58.199 --> 1:00:02.503
I don't really want to say heroes,
but I do want to say heroes.

1:00:02.537 --> 1:00:06.941
And we found this place,
my harmonious home.

1:00:06.974 --> 1:00:10.344
It's been a dream. My dream.
You know what I mean?

1:00:12.246 --> 1:00:17.718
Wow. I'm totally going to use
that in my next freestyle.

1:00:17.751 --> 1:00:22.223
Dream, mean?

1:00:22.256 --> 1:00:27.128
Oh, man, I was so lost when you
guys knew me before, you know?

1:00:27.161 --> 1:00:30.231
So, I bet this comes across
as a bit of a shock,

1:00:30.264 --> 1:00:34.235
but, uh, I'm much more
spiritually grounded right now.

1:00:34.835 --> 1:00:37.304
Yeah, we sense that.

1:00:37.338 --> 1:00:42.109
You know, Brooklyn has actually
been very spiritual lately.

1:00:42.143 --> 1:00:44.311
You two should totally chat.

1:00:44.345 --> 1:00:47.715
You've been very
spiritual, Brooklyn?

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:52.453
I totally felt that.
Look at those vibes.

1:00:52.486 --> 1:00:54.688
Yeah, that is fantastic.

1:00:54.722 --> 1:00:58.527
That spirituality is in there,
isn't it?

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.962
Body contact is
fully encouraged, girls.

1:01:01.996 --> 1:01:05.733
Don't touch the nip. Just give it a
stare if you need something, all right?

1:01:05.766 --> 1:01:07.868
My bad.

1:01:07.902 --> 1:01:09.803
What's that
dick-looking thing?

1:01:09.837 --> 1:01:12.641
- The dick.
- Behind you.

1:01:12.673 --> 1:01:15.342
Oh, that's my didgeridoo.

1:01:15.376 --> 1:01:16.443
Didgeri-what?

1:01:17.512 --> 1:01:20.582
It's from Austria-lia.

1:01:20.615 --> 1:01:24.285
It's an instrument, you know?
Native to the Origi-namis peoples.

1:01:24.318 --> 1:01:26.220
Picked it up in my travels.

1:01:26.253 --> 1:01:29.156
Oh, well, that's cool.
You went to Australia?

1:01:29.190 --> 1:01:31.660
I did not.
I went to Cracker Barrel.

1:01:31.725 --> 1:01:35.262
But it was in New Milford, Connecticut,
and they had some sweet deals there, so.

1:01:35.296 --> 1:01:39.233
And I hear the wood
is from New Zealand,

1:01:39.266 --> 1:01:42.169
which is like
a second Austria-lia.

1:01:42.203 --> 1:01:45.072
- No, that's incorrect.
- Hannah.

1:01:46.407 --> 1:01:48.342
Why don't you
give it a blow?

1:01:48.842 --> 1:01:49.743
In here.

1:01:49.777 --> 1:01:51.045
Yeah. Come close.

1:01:53.314 --> 1:01:55.550
Blow harder.

1:01:58.018 --> 1:01:59.153
You look ridiculous.

1:01:59.186 --> 1:02:00.254
And that's what she says.

1:02:00.287 --> 1:02:03.692
Yeah, it's like
a fiery flow state, man.

1:02:03.724 --> 1:02:05.759
That is just awesome.

1:02:07.962 --> 1:02:11.298
I must look retarded. I've never
played one of these things before.

1:02:11.332 --> 1:02:12.399
I'm sorry.

1:02:12.433 --> 1:02:14.134
Whoa.

1:02:15.469 --> 1:02:16.337
Nope.

1:02:17.037 --> 1:02:18.339
Did I say something wrong?

1:02:18.372 --> 1:02:20.441
Was it because I said
the word retarded?

1:02:20.474 --> 1:02:22.644
No. Oh, I'm sorry.

1:02:24.579 --> 1:02:26.380
Listen...

1:02:27.649 --> 1:02:31.118
We, uh, we don't...

1:02:32.286 --> 1:02:34.522
We don't apologize here.

1:02:35.189 --> 1:02:37.258
We don't say "I'm sorry."

1:02:37.958 --> 1:02:39.893
But "retarded" is okay?

1:02:39.927 --> 1:02:44.498
Re... No, we don't like to put
ourselves down, you know?

1:02:44.532 --> 1:02:47.602
In fact, whenever
somebody says, "I'm sorry,"

1:02:47.636 --> 1:02:51.272
we like to follow it up
with the phrase, "I'm sexy."

1:02:51.939 --> 1:02:54.908
So, I'm sexy.

1:02:54.942 --> 1:02:57.144
So you know what that means?

1:02:57.177 --> 1:03:00.814
- I'm not sorry.
- Try again.

1:03:00.848 --> 1:03:03.183
I'm not sorry,
I'm sexy.

1:03:03.217 --> 1:03:07.221
Or is it supposed to be,
"I'm sexy? I'm not sorry."

1:03:07.254 --> 1:03:09.323
I think you're supposed to say
I'm sexy, Hannah.

1:03:09.356 --> 1:03:12.761
Yeah,
she totally gets it. Sexy.

1:03:13.994 --> 1:03:15.162
I'm sexy.

1:03:15.195 --> 1:03:16.564
There you go.

1:03:16.598 --> 1:03:18.700
Now say it again
with a little more meaning.

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:20.100
I'm sexy!

1:03:20.134 --> 1:03:21.335
I'm sexy.

1:03:21.368 --> 1:03:24.305
- Didn't that feel good?
- Eh, yeah.

1:03:24.338 --> 1:03:25.607
Where's your bathroom?

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:27.141
Ah, the "washroom,"

1:03:27.174 --> 1:03:29.209
- as they say in good old Canada...
- Hurry!

1:03:29.243 --> 1:03:31.613
...is down the hallway
to the left.

1:03:31.646 --> 1:03:33.213
Hah!

1:03:33.447 --> 1:03:34.214
Ooh.

1:03:34.248 --> 1:03:38.252
I'm sorry. Or I'm sexy.

1:03:38.285 --> 1:03:41.523
You know, Canada is
a really spiritual place.

1:03:41.556 --> 1:03:44.759
I planned on doing
Ayahuasca there this summer.

1:03:45.359 --> 1:03:47.562
It's a third Australia.

1:03:49.396 --> 1:03:53.200
My shaman says that doing
hallucinogens in places

1:03:53.233 --> 1:03:55.502
you've never been
is a great idea.

1:03:55.537 --> 1:03:57.572
Yeah, that sounds
really smart.

1:03:57.605 --> 1:04:01.208
- Shamans are smart. Yeah.
- Mmm. Mmm.

1:04:02.009 --> 1:04:03.745
You should do it sometime.

1:04:03.778 --> 1:04:07.981
Yeah, I feel like I've done a lot of
work to repress any negative emotions,

1:04:08.015 --> 1:04:12.721
so it's probably not for me,
but totally admire your passion.

1:04:13.588 --> 1:04:16.658
- Cha.
- Yeah.

1:04:17.224 --> 1:04:21.529
- Cha.
- Yeah.

1:04:21.563 --> 1:04:23.330
You know what
I like about this place

1:04:23.364 --> 1:04:25.600
better than the Big Apple?

1:04:27.468 --> 1:04:29.503
You can see
the stars at night.

1:04:31.138 --> 1:04:32.373
Should we go look?

1:04:33.742 --> 1:04:35.175
Just watch your step.

1:04:35.209 --> 1:04:38.312
We've got a lot of stone-age
going on around here.

1:04:38.345 --> 1:04:41.248
We've got our
little dipping ponds,

1:04:41.281 --> 1:04:44.184
and then we've got
our bigger dipping pond.

1:04:44.218 --> 1:04:46.821
It's pretty wet in there,
I'll tell you that.

1:04:46.855 --> 1:04:48.422
All right, come on in.

1:04:48.455 --> 1:04:50.558
Here it is, our Zen Zone.

1:04:50.592 --> 1:04:54.361
- Oh, okay.
- It's like double Z, Zen Zone right here.

1:04:54.395 --> 1:04:55.730
Okay.

1:04:56.930 --> 1:05:00.033
They're dancing tonight.

1:05:00.067 --> 1:05:01.368
There she is.

1:05:01.402 --> 1:05:04.271
Mrs. Dipper.
It's the biggest Dipper.

1:05:05.305 --> 1:05:08.242
Um, I can't really see it.

1:05:08.275 --> 1:05:10.177
It's pretty cloudy.

1:05:10.210 --> 1:05:14.214
Yeah, but if you
imagine it... it's there.

1:05:15.683 --> 1:05:17.886
Like pow... There it is.

1:05:20.655 --> 1:05:22.724
Sure. Okay.

1:05:26.293 --> 1:05:27.629
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:05:27.662 --> 1:05:30.397
Has the nipple guy
taught you nothing, sir?

1:05:30.431 --> 1:05:33.934
Relax. I'm just feeling
your heart chakra.

1:05:34.869 --> 1:05:36.503
It's speaking to me.

1:05:37.337 --> 1:05:40.407
Wow. She's really
verbal tonight.

1:05:40.441 --> 1:05:41.776
She's telling me that

1:05:41.810 --> 1:05:44.579
there's a little bit of
heartbreak in your love life.

1:05:46.815 --> 1:05:48.315
Yeah, it just feels like

1:05:48.348 --> 1:05:51.920
you're cupping my boob
and very tenderly.

1:05:51.952 --> 1:05:53.353
Okay.

1:05:53.788 --> 1:05:55.322
I'm sexy.

1:06:00.994 --> 1:06:02.597
Spiritual, my asshole!

1:06:02.630 --> 1:06:04.599
What kind of person tries to
make you comfortable

1:06:04.632 --> 1:06:07.034
and then jumps on top of you?

1:06:07.067 --> 1:06:08.502
A horny person.

1:06:09.369 --> 1:06:10.772
There you are.

1:06:10.805 --> 1:06:13.675
I googled what "ghee" is,
and it's basically butter.

1:06:13.708 --> 1:06:16.443
I'm not well.
I'm not well at all!

1:06:16.477 --> 1:06:18.312
We need to leave,
like, right now.

1:06:18.345 --> 1:06:20.280
- What? All right.
- Come on, come on.

1:06:20.314 --> 1:06:24.819
Come back. I...
I finally got hard.

1:06:24.853 --> 1:06:27.354
I don't know why we
couldn't have just stayed there.

1:06:27.387 --> 1:06:29.657
I would have slept
on the floor with my ghee gas.

1:06:29.691 --> 1:06:32.259
That's sure to plant
some positive vibes everywhere.

1:06:32.292 --> 1:06:33.327
What do you mean?

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:35.062
The guy fucking touched
my left tit.

1:06:35.095 --> 1:06:36.731
Do you know how
inappropriate that is?

1:06:36.764 --> 1:06:37.532
Right. I get it.

1:06:37.565 --> 1:06:38.800
But we don't have
a place to stay.

1:06:38.833 --> 1:06:40.735
We don't have money.
We don't have the RAV4 keys.

1:06:40.768 --> 1:06:42.302
And my phone's about to die,
Hannah.

1:06:42.336 --> 1:06:43.805
Should I go back
and ask for a charge?

1:06:43.838 --> 1:06:45.507
This is all your fault.

1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:46.641
If you hadn't gotten
into a fight

1:06:46.674 --> 1:06:48.075
with those two girls
back at the bar,

1:06:48.108 --> 1:06:49.376
we'd still have the backpack,

1:06:49.409 --> 1:06:51.813
and we'd be sleeping
at Chateau Molesto right now.

1:06:51.846 --> 1:06:53.848
Your Jersey groupies?

1:06:54.616 --> 1:06:56.216
Okay. I see what this is about.

1:06:56.250 --> 1:06:59.353
It was really nice to receive some
love and affection from someone

1:06:59.386 --> 1:07:01.021
since you don't get any
from your boyfriend.

1:07:01.054 --> 1:07:03.490
Like, when was the last time
you even had sex, Hannah?

1:07:03.525 --> 1:07:05.158
You're always giving blowjobs.

1:07:05.192 --> 1:07:06.260
I'm surprised
you were offended

1:07:06.293 --> 1:07:07.327
some guy touched your boob.

1:07:07.361 --> 1:07:09.731
I give blowjobs
because I like them.

1:07:09.764 --> 1:07:11.064
You give blowjobs

1:07:11.098 --> 1:07:13.601
because it's the only validation
you get in your relationship.

1:07:13.635 --> 1:07:15.837
You're a professional cuddler,
for Christ's sake!

1:07:15.870 --> 1:07:17.437
The only people
you can get in your bed

1:07:17.471 --> 1:07:19.339
are the ones that are
paying you for attention

1:07:19.373 --> 1:07:22.309
- because you are a...
- I'm a what?

1:07:22.342 --> 1:07:23.778
See, I knew you wouldn't
stick up for yourself

1:07:23.811 --> 1:07:26.748
unless you're on your stupid
fucking reality TV show, Hannah.

1:07:26.781 --> 1:07:29.584
So say it. Say it!
I'm a what?

1:07:29.617 --> 1:07:32.052
Oh, are you waiting for someone
to cut to commercial break?

1:07:32.085 --> 1:07:33.521
You're a fucking bitch.

1:07:33.555 --> 1:07:36.356
Fuck, Hannah!

1:07:36.958 --> 1:07:38.325
My fucking face!

1:07:38.358 --> 1:07:40.160
I'm not gonna be able
to post now...

1:07:47.835 --> 1:07:49.102
Ah!

1:07:50.905 --> 1:07:52.306
I fucking hate you!

1:07:52.339 --> 1:07:53.808
Fuck you!

1:07:53.841 --> 1:07:54.909
God!

1:07:54.943 --> 1:07:56.978
That's it. I'm done.

1:07:57.011 --> 1:07:58.445
I am out of here.

1:07:58.478 --> 1:08:00.715
No. No, I'm done.

1:08:00.748 --> 1:08:04.318
I am done with you and this
stupid fake friendship.

1:08:04.351 --> 1:08:06.486
You are so selfish.
And you know what?

1:08:06.521 --> 1:08:08.322
I know you made me
look bad

1:08:08.355 --> 1:08:10.123
in that beach picture
on purpose.

1:08:10.157 --> 1:08:12.192
A real friend
wouldn't do that.

1:08:12.225 --> 1:08:14.963
You know what?
Go. Call Damon.

1:08:14.996 --> 1:08:18.566
Well, I would,
but I don't have a phone anymore.

1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:20.100
And maybe you could
keep up with me

1:08:20.133 --> 1:08:22.604
if you went on any of those
hikes you've been blabbing about.

1:08:22.637 --> 1:08:25.974
Good luck in the streets
without a phone, bitch!

1:08:26.007 --> 1:08:27.609
Give a couple of blowjobs,

1:08:27.642 --> 1:08:30.377
and maybe someone will
give you a phone for free.

1:08:30.410 --> 1:08:32.914
Well, at least I have
a boyfriend to call.

1:08:32.947 --> 1:08:35.282
For somebody who pretends to
be such a slut all the time,

1:08:35.315 --> 1:08:36.684
nobody even wants
to touch you

1:08:36.718 --> 1:08:38.251
unless they're
mentally deranged

1:08:38.285 --> 1:08:39.654
or pays for it.

1:08:40.354 --> 1:08:41.421
Ball licker!

1:08:42.155 --> 1:08:44.959
- Pussy licker.
- What? No.

1:08:44.993 --> 1:08:45.893
You know what?

1:08:45.927 --> 1:08:48.596
You were always
the fucking Tonya.

1:08:48.630 --> 1:08:50.531
Always jealous
of my success,

1:08:50.565 --> 1:08:52.100
fucking trailer trash.

1:08:52.132 --> 1:08:55.202
I'm a Nancy, motherfucker.

1:08:55.235 --> 1:08:56.503
I'm the classy one.

1:08:56.537 --> 1:08:59.774
Oh, yeah. You're a real
"class act," Brooklyn.

1:08:59.807 --> 1:09:01.743
And by the way,
Tonya's story was

1:09:01.776 --> 1:09:04.045
completely misrepresented
in the media.

1:09:04.078 --> 1:09:06.547
"Fake news." Ugh!

1:09:06.581 --> 1:09:07.849
Fucking bitch!

1:09:27.769 --> 1:09:29.704
Oh!

1:09:29.737 --> 1:09:31.438
Thank God!

1:09:33.908 --> 1:09:35.777
You know, if you ladies
want to stay

1:09:35.810 --> 1:09:37.578
and just drink with me
in the back,

1:09:37.612 --> 1:09:40.915
I got some more... got some
harder stuff in there.

1:09:40.948 --> 1:09:42.482
- That's okay.
- Couple of couches back there.

1:09:42.517 --> 1:09:45.753
And you know, I can get into the
diner, get some of the food.

1:09:45.787 --> 1:09:46.654
You sure?

1:09:46.688 --> 1:09:49.057
Thank you so very much,
kind sir.

1:09:53.326 --> 1:09:55.195
ID, please.

1:09:55.228 --> 1:09:57.799
You gotta be shitting me.

1:09:59.033 --> 1:10:01.669
But you didn't ID them.
They're like 12.

1:10:01.703 --> 1:10:03.538
You tellin' me
how to do my job?

1:10:03.871 --> 1:10:04.772
No.

1:10:04.806 --> 1:10:05.940
Well, if you're not
gonna buy anything,

1:10:05.973 --> 1:10:07.575
then get the hell
out of my store.

1:10:08.042 --> 1:10:10.477
Ugh!

1:10:12.180 --> 1:10:13.681
Ugh.

1:10:16.249 --> 1:10:17.284
God.

1:10:21.622 --> 1:10:23.223
Change your mind?

1:10:23.256 --> 1:10:26.761
Well, he carded me,
and I don't have my ID, so.

1:10:26.794 --> 1:10:30.064
Aren't you, like, 24, though?

1:10:30.098 --> 1:10:31.264
You're sweet.

1:10:31.298 --> 1:10:33.735
Bennett can literally
sweet-talk anyone into anything.

1:10:33.768 --> 1:10:36.704
Yeah. I'm what some might
like to call an "influencer."

1:10:36.738 --> 1:10:37.805
I influence people.

1:10:37.839 --> 1:10:39.306
I've got a friend like that.

1:10:39.339 --> 1:10:41.909
Well, I had
a friend like that.

1:10:42.643 --> 1:10:44.311
Uh, I'm Hannah.

1:10:44.344 --> 1:10:46.279
I'm Hailey. Bennett.

1:10:47.148 --> 1:10:49.984
Hailey and Bennett.

1:10:50.017 --> 1:10:52.620
Hey, you got two bucks?
I could do it again.

1:10:53.187 --> 1:10:54.789
Uh...

1:10:54.822 --> 1:10:57.324
- Somewhere...
- Yo, did you get punched in the eye?

1:10:57.357 --> 1:10:58.893
Are you a victim
of domestic violence?

1:10:58.926 --> 1:11:01.896
- No.
- Oh, my God. Were you attacked by a coyote?

1:11:01.929 --> 1:11:03.197
That's so scary.

1:11:03.231 --> 1:11:04.431
It's so close
to where we live.

1:11:04.464 --> 1:11:06.634
I know! They say that stuff
could happen close to home,

1:11:06.667 --> 1:11:09.937
but I didn't expect it on our
local gas station doorstep.

1:11:09.971 --> 1:11:11.038
You poor thing.

1:11:11.072 --> 1:11:12.640
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:11:12.673 --> 1:11:14.208
Hold my beer.

1:11:19.714 --> 1:11:21.682
She's my best friend.

1:11:22.349 --> 1:11:23.316
For now.

1:11:44.404 --> 1:11:46.174
A car. A car!
Hey, wait!

1:11:46.207 --> 1:11:49.177
Wait! Wait, for love
of all that is holy!

1:11:49.210 --> 1:11:50.443
Wait!

1:11:50.477 --> 1:11:52.046
Oh, my God.

1:11:52.079 --> 1:11:53.648
Please don't kill me.

1:11:55.348 --> 1:11:57.985
Oh, thank God.

1:11:58.019 --> 1:12:00.121
Look, my phone is
completely dead.

1:12:00.154 --> 1:12:02.957
Can I just plug it in for a
minute and I'll pay for a ride?

1:12:03.390 --> 1:12:05.126
Sure.

1:12:05.693 --> 1:12:06.994
Here's the cable.

1:12:07.929 --> 1:12:09.329
Thank you.

1:12:09.362 --> 1:12:10.631
So, where are you headed?

1:12:10.665 --> 1:12:12.399
I don't actually know
at this point,

1:12:12.432 --> 1:12:14.068
if I'm being completely honest.

1:12:16.704 --> 1:12:18.673
You know, I can't really
take you anywhere

1:12:18.706 --> 1:12:20.775
unless you know
where you wanna go.

1:12:21.242 --> 1:12:23.945
I don't know.

1:12:23.978 --> 1:12:27.014
It's like my decision making
is so fucked up.

1:12:27.048 --> 1:12:29.416
Like, I usually think
it's gonna be a great time

1:12:29.449 --> 1:12:32.553
and then nine times out
of ten, it just goes to shit.

1:12:32.587 --> 1:12:34.454
You're not the responsible one,
are you?

1:12:34.487 --> 1:12:35.923
Excuse me?

1:12:35.957 --> 1:12:40.528
I see a lot of people
in the back seat there and...

1:12:40.561 --> 1:12:43.664
Groups of friends that come in
and there's always "the fun one."

1:12:43.698 --> 1:12:45.666
- I'm fun.
- Yeah, exactly.

1:12:45.700 --> 1:12:48.870
Fun ones always know
how to find a party.

1:12:48.903 --> 1:12:51.572
And then there is
the responsible one.

1:12:51.606 --> 1:12:53.875
And the responsible one
knows how to get home.

1:12:54.675 --> 1:12:56.277
Wow, that's deep.

1:12:58.411 --> 1:13:00.047
Oh, wait.

1:13:01.515 --> 1:13:03.317
I actually do know
where I wanna go.

1:13:09.422 --> 1:13:10.791
Ugh. God.

1:13:11.125 --> 1:13:12.059
Oh.

1:13:13.861 --> 1:13:15.930
Oh!

1:13:15.963 --> 1:13:18.799
It's her fucking fault
we're here in the first place.

1:13:18.833 --> 1:13:21.035
She's just so bossy
and so controlling.

1:13:21.068 --> 1:13:22.837
She always thinks
she's so right.

1:13:22.870 --> 1:13:24.205
You know what I mean.

1:13:25.373 --> 1:13:27.174
And she called me
a pussy.

1:13:27.208 --> 1:13:28.542
Pussies are beautiful.

1:13:28.576 --> 1:13:30.410
Pussies make babies
and shit.

1:13:30.443 --> 1:13:31.779
I'm an independent woman.

1:13:31.812 --> 1:13:33.781
I'm a tough-ass broad.

1:13:35.082 --> 1:13:36.384
Pussy.

1:13:37.184 --> 1:13:38.686
Oh, God, no!

1:13:38.719 --> 1:13:39.987
No, no, no.

1:13:48.229 --> 1:13:49.864
Thank you.

1:13:51.098 --> 1:13:52.733
You're so nice.

1:13:54.936 --> 1:13:57.405
Hey.

1:13:57.437 --> 1:14:01.542
So, that yacht ride turned out to
not be all it was cracked up to be.

1:14:01.575 --> 1:14:03.377
I can't imagine why.

1:14:03.411 --> 1:14:05.046
Treasure got a little seasick.

1:14:05.079 --> 1:14:08.382
Yeah... She threw up and it
kind of killed the whole vibe.

1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:14.522
Well, she was so lovely.

1:14:14.555 --> 1:14:16.424
Like pirate's booty.

1:14:16.456 --> 1:14:17.591
You know,
I just keep thinking

1:14:17.625 --> 1:14:19.193
that I should be
getting these major parts

1:14:19.226 --> 1:14:22.462
and it's just not happening,
you know?

1:14:22.495 --> 1:14:23.965
What? The thought
of channeling

1:14:23.998 --> 1:14:26.901
your inner Jerry Orbach
not doing it for you?

1:14:28.803 --> 1:14:30.470
Wait a minute.

1:14:30.503 --> 1:14:32.472
He was in <i>Law and Justice,</i> too.

1:14:34.442 --> 1:14:37.311
It's kind of like <i>Inception</i>
because so are you.

1:14:37.345 --> 1:14:38.346
<i>Inception,</i> exactly.

1:14:38.379 --> 1:14:40.815
I should be
getting offers like Leonardo

1:14:40.848 --> 1:14:42.583
or even Ryan Gosling.

1:14:42.616 --> 1:14:44.719
I would have
killed <i>La La Land.</i>

1:14:44.752 --> 1:14:45.886
Murdered it.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:47.054
I just wish somebody
would ask me

1:14:47.088 --> 1:14:48.723
what I wanted to
do every now and then.

1:14:48.756 --> 1:14:50.490
Like, what kind of parts
I want to play.

1:14:50.524 --> 1:14:52.259
And I got what I deserve.

1:14:52.293 --> 1:14:53.894
Yeah, it would be nice

1:14:53.928 --> 1:14:56.330
if someone asked you
about yourself occasionally.

1:14:56.364 --> 1:14:57.732
I agree.

1:14:57.765 --> 1:15:00.468
Maybe Ben Stiller
was all wrong about me.

1:15:00.500 --> 1:15:01.669
It boggles my mind.

1:15:01.702 --> 1:15:05.339
Bartender, can I get
another shot, please?

1:15:05.373 --> 1:15:06.507
Make it two.

1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:09.043
You know what? You know what?
Just keep 'em coming,

1:15:09.076 --> 1:15:11.078
because I'm gonna
need them.

1:15:11.112 --> 1:15:13.180
Hey. Hey...

1:15:13.214 --> 1:15:16.217
You know what?
You really get me.

1:15:16.984 --> 1:15:18.319
We should talk more often.

1:15:18.352 --> 1:15:19.854
You know,

1:15:19.887 --> 1:15:22.890
I'm thinking that
we just keep drinking

1:15:22.923 --> 1:15:26.794
and then keep the talking
to an absolute minimum.

1:15:27.395 --> 1:15:30.164
Yeah. Sound good?

1:15:30.197 --> 1:15:32.066
Sure. If you say so.
Here we go.

1:15:32.733 --> 1:15:34.068
Bottoms up.

1:15:38.472 --> 1:15:39.340
Oh.

1:15:42.943 --> 1:15:44.545
Wait, hold on.

1:15:45.780 --> 1:15:47.548
This doesn't feel right.

1:15:47.581 --> 1:15:48.849
Should we go to
the bathroom?

1:15:49.750 --> 1:15:51.052
Shut up.

1:15:53.988 --> 1:15:56.424
No, but seriously. Seriously,
where are you staying?

1:15:56.457 --> 1:15:58.492
We're starting to look
as creepy as them.

1:16:02.096 --> 1:16:04.265
Oh, you're right.
That is aggressive.

1:16:04.298 --> 1:16:05.466
Is he inside her?

1:16:05.499 --> 1:16:07.501
What the actual fuck?

1:16:11.105 --> 1:16:11.972
Hmm.

1:16:12.339 --> 1:16:14.075
I knew it.

1:16:14.108 --> 1:16:16.310
I knew you were
a sketchy little fuck.

1:16:16.343 --> 1:16:18.779
Brooklyn... Wait.
Let me explain.

1:16:18.813 --> 1:16:20.748
Explain what?

1:16:20.781 --> 1:16:22.116
You were
always so controlling

1:16:22.149 --> 1:16:24.251
because you were the one
cheating on Hannah.

1:16:24.285 --> 1:16:26.854
- Why don't we go to your hotel?
- No, butt out, all right?

1:16:26.887 --> 1:16:28.789
- Butt out.
- This is just a good friend.

1:16:28.823 --> 1:16:30.091
I don't know what you saw,

1:16:30.124 --> 1:16:31.592
but it's not
what it looks like.

1:16:31.625 --> 1:16:33.060
I knew you guys were
in San Diego,

1:16:33.094 --> 1:16:35.262
and then I lost my GPS
locator a few hours ago

1:16:35.296 --> 1:16:36.831
and then
I ran into Heidi here,

1:16:36.864 --> 1:16:38.899
and we were just about
to come find you guys.

1:16:38.933 --> 1:16:41.135
You know what?
This is exactly

1:16:41.168 --> 1:16:42.970
what it looks like, okay?

1:16:43.003 --> 1:16:46.040
Hannah is such
an amazing person.

1:16:46.073 --> 1:16:49.243
She is loyal. She's kind.
She's beautiful.

1:16:49.276 --> 1:16:52.246
She wouldn't be in this
situation if it weren't for me.

1:16:52.947 --> 1:16:54.281
You know what?

1:16:54.748 --> 1:16:56.450
Fuck you, Damon,

1:16:56.484 --> 1:16:58.052
for being a self-centered,

1:16:58.085 --> 1:17:00.187
emotionally abusive
little twat

1:17:00.221 --> 1:17:02.890
to the best person
you will ever fucking meet.

1:17:02.923 --> 1:17:04.258
And for who? For Heidi.

1:17:04.291 --> 1:17:05.960
Does she yodel
and herd sheep?

1:17:05.993 --> 1:17:09.930
And fuck you for being
such a fucking narcissist.

1:17:09.964 --> 1:17:11.098
And you're a bad actor.

1:17:11.132 --> 1:17:12.633
- I'm going to find Hannah.
- Oh!

1:17:13.734 --> 1:17:15.436
Thanks for the drinks,
boys.

1:17:15.469 --> 1:17:16.605
Brooklyn.

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:27.781
Hannah.

1:17:27.815 --> 1:17:28.916
B, I need to talk to you.

1:17:28.949 --> 1:17:31.252
No, I need to talk to you.

1:17:31.285 --> 1:17:33.454
I'm so sorry
I made you come here.

1:17:33.487 --> 1:17:34.989
No, I'm glad you did.

1:17:35.022 --> 1:17:37.424
It made me think that
you were right all along.

1:17:37.458 --> 1:17:38.425
About what?

1:17:38.459 --> 1:17:40.629
That I need to stand up
for myself more.

1:17:40.661 --> 1:17:42.263
Oh, yeah. You do.

1:17:42.296 --> 1:17:44.665
If I didn't want to come on this
trip, I wouldn't have agreed to it.

1:17:44.698 --> 1:17:46.133
But I basically forced you.

1:17:46.167 --> 1:17:49.670
No. But I saw this homeless man
masturbating on a park bench,

1:17:49.703 --> 1:17:51.205
and it got me thinking that

1:17:51.238 --> 1:17:54.408
masturbating and procrastinating
are basically the same thing.

1:17:54.441 --> 1:17:56.177
It's all fun and games
until you realize

1:17:56.210 --> 1:17:59.446
that you're basically
fucking yourself.

1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:03.150
Are you still drunk? Because I'm
not really following this analogy,

1:18:03.184 --> 1:18:04.351
but also, I'm drunk.

1:18:04.385 --> 1:18:06.787
I've just been so scared
to speak up for myself

1:18:06.820 --> 1:18:07.855
and break up with Damon

1:18:07.888 --> 1:18:09.123
because I don't wanna
be alone.

1:18:09.156 --> 1:18:11.593
But I'm not alone
'cause I have you.

1:18:13.894 --> 1:18:15.229
Damon's cheating on you.

1:18:15.262 --> 1:18:16.665
I know.

1:18:16.697 --> 1:18:19.166
No, like, I just ran into him at
a bar making out with another girl

1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:20.901
while I was making out
with Christian.

1:18:20.935 --> 1:18:22.336
Don't ask. But yeah,

1:18:22.369 --> 1:18:24.104
he was basically giving her
oral in the bar.

1:18:24.138 --> 1:18:25.906
- It was gross.
- Okay, I didn't need to know

1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:28.742
all of that information,
but I know that he's cheating on me.

1:18:28.776 --> 1:18:30.077
He's not
that fucking clever.

1:18:30.110 --> 1:18:32.446
I basically stalk his
Instagram likes, so...

1:18:32.479 --> 1:18:35.316
You know what? He was a total
nub when I confronted him, too.

1:18:35.349 --> 1:18:37.184
He was just, like,
staring at me

1:18:37.218 --> 1:18:40.689
with these SpongeBob googly-eyed things.
It was stupid.

1:18:40.721 --> 1:18:42.156
Ugh, I'm so done with him.

1:18:42.189 --> 1:18:45.125
I'm ready to be a strong,
independent woman.

1:18:45.159 --> 1:18:47.261
Kind of like you.

1:18:47.294 --> 1:18:50.130
No, if anything, you need
to be less like me.

1:18:50.164 --> 1:18:52.099
You're so nice to people.

1:18:52.132 --> 1:18:55.970
I'm starting to realize that I just
need to be by myself for a while.

1:18:56.003 --> 1:18:58.339
Maybe date me for once.

1:18:58.372 --> 1:19:01.008
Holy shit. We're adulting
so hard right now.

1:19:02.876 --> 1:19:05.012
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sexy.

1:19:06.715 --> 1:19:08.182
Oh, my God.

1:19:08.215 --> 1:19:10.217
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1:19:10.951 --> 1:19:12.386
Jesus Christ!

1:19:12.419 --> 1:19:13.887
Very sexy.

1:19:13.921 --> 1:19:15.756
Bro...

1:19:16.558 --> 1:19:17.525
Ha.

1:19:17.559 --> 1:19:20.127
Oh, ladies, some guy named Andrew...

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:21.395
...returned this
to the hotel earlier.

1:19:21.428 --> 1:19:23.764
I'm having
such good karma tonight.

1:19:24.398 --> 1:19:26.367
What's in it?

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:29.303
Well, yeah. They took
everything of value...

1:19:29.336 --> 1:19:32.273
My mom's credit card,
cash, everything.

1:19:34.008 --> 1:19:36.745
But, of course, they left...

1:19:37.712 --> 1:19:39.780
Oh, fuck.

1:19:41.716 --> 1:19:43.784
The RAV4
in the valet is yours?

1:19:43.817 --> 1:19:45.620
Wow, that's hilarious.

1:19:47.288 --> 1:19:49.223
It's a hideous car.

1:19:49.256 --> 1:19:51.825
Thank you
for being so honest.

1:19:51.859 --> 1:19:52.993
The car's not normal.

1:19:53.027 --> 1:19:54.696
Everyone keeps acting
like it's normal.

1:19:54.729 --> 1:19:57.666
I would tip you, but I don't
have any cash, so...

1:19:59.133 --> 1:20:02.169
Oh, well, here.
You can have this.

1:20:02.202 --> 1:20:04.004
I mean, wait...

1:20:04.038 --> 1:20:06.106
We've been through
so much together.

1:20:07.875 --> 1:20:10.110
Okay. There you go.
It's for you.

1:20:10.144 --> 1:20:13.715
That's, uh, super generous.
Thanks.

1:20:13.748 --> 1:20:14.783
You're welcome.

1:20:15.650 --> 1:20:16.817
You're welcome.

1:20:16.850 --> 1:20:18.252
Take care of that.

1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:20.120
Thank you.

1:20:25.959 --> 1:20:28.429
Oh, my God.
Is he still calling you?

1:20:28.462 --> 1:20:31.198
Yeah. One of the perils of
buying my new phone this morning.

1:20:31.231 --> 1:20:33.500
Sorry, babe.

1:20:33.535 --> 1:20:35.235
You know what?

1:20:35.269 --> 1:20:37.871
Damon, I don't even care
what you have to say.

1:20:37.905 --> 1:20:38.972
I'm done.

1:20:39.006 --> 1:20:41.342
Wow. What are you doing?

1:20:41.375 --> 1:20:42.876
What're you...

1:20:42.910 --> 1:20:45.913
Hannah, you just bought that
two hours ago.

1:20:45.946 --> 1:20:47.247
Shit.

1:20:49.450 --> 1:20:51.786
Wait, how soon does your
mom's new credit card come?

1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:53.887
I'm kidding.

1:20:53.921 --> 1:20:55.923
Talk about
no fucks given, though.

1:20:55.956 --> 1:20:58.593
I feel it. I'm ready
to be a boss.

1:20:58.626 --> 1:20:59.927
Oh, that a girl!

1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:02.262
Hey, do you want to stop
off at that overlook again

1:21:02.296 --> 1:21:03.197
and take a photo?

1:21:03.230 --> 1:21:05.132
No, I'm good.

1:21:05.165 --> 1:21:06.601
Is there anything
you wanna do?

1:21:07.836 --> 1:21:09.069
I'm doing it.

1:21:09.103 --> 1:21:10.805
Me too.

1:21:10.839 --> 1:21:12.306
Ooh, I love this song.

1:21:14.308 --> 1:21:16.910
<i>♪ So, baby, if you want me</i>

1:21:18.879 --> 1:21:21.482
<i>♪ You've got to show me love</i>

1:21:22.617 --> 1:21:26.588
<i>♪ Words are so easy to say
all right</i>

1:21:26.621 --> 1:21:29.591
<i>♪ You've got to show me love ♪</i>

1:21:41.402 --> 1:21:43.303
Well,
I'm very impressed.

1:21:43.337 --> 1:21:44.572
You're so active now.

1:21:44.606 --> 1:21:46.440
Quitting drinking will do that.

1:21:46.473 --> 1:21:48.275
I actually wake up
before noon now.

1:21:48.308 --> 1:21:50.512
And you exercise.

1:21:50.545 --> 1:21:52.413
Walking these hills
is good exercise

1:21:52.446 --> 1:21:54.114
and I find myself
enjoying hot yoga.

1:21:54.148 --> 1:21:55.717
So how do you like
the new job?

1:21:55.750 --> 1:21:56.950
It's good, you know?

1:21:56.984 --> 1:21:59.319
I'm really enjoying volunteering
in the writers' room.

1:21:59.353 --> 1:22:00.622
So many cute boys.

1:22:00.655 --> 1:22:02.990
- I mean, total nerds, but so cute.
- Brooklyn...

1:22:03.023 --> 1:22:04.224
But, if you let me finish,

1:22:04.258 --> 1:22:05.827
I'm taking some time
for myself.

1:22:05.860 --> 1:22:07.294
There we go.

1:22:07.327 --> 1:22:09.798
Although I will be taking the odd
cuddle appointment from time to time

1:22:09.831 --> 1:22:12.634
because I find myself really
longing for the touch of a man.

1:22:12.667 --> 1:22:13.967
I hear you.

1:22:14.001 --> 1:22:16.036
Hey, Hannah. Brooklyn.

1:22:16.069 --> 1:22:17.906
Just what we needed.
A third wheel.

1:22:17.938 --> 1:22:20.909
Hannah,
can I talk to you for a second?

1:22:20.941 --> 1:22:22.376
Yeah, sure.

1:22:25.112 --> 1:22:27.481
Oh, okay.
I'm just gonna go over there.

1:22:28.115 --> 1:22:29.450
Bye, Teddy.

1:22:30.518 --> 1:22:31.586
What's up?

1:22:33.053 --> 1:22:34.689
I know you kind of have
a boyfriend...

1:22:34.722 --> 1:22:37.525
Um... had.
Kind of had a boyfriend.

1:22:37.559 --> 1:22:40.194
Oh, right. Well,
I was wondering

1:22:40.227 --> 1:22:42.630
if you wanted to have dinner
with me or something sometime.

1:22:42.664 --> 1:22:45.199
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd like that.

1:22:45.232 --> 1:22:46.835
- Totally.
- All right, cool.

1:22:46.868 --> 1:22:49.938
I gotta get going, but maybe I could
grab you around, say, 7:00 p.m.?

1:22:49.970 --> 1:22:51.806
Oh, um...

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:54.408
Unless you don't want to,
then I totally don't...

1:22:54.441 --> 1:22:56.711
No, no, no.
I am totally free tonight.

1:22:56.744 --> 1:22:58.345
I am free as a bird.

1:22:58.378 --> 1:22:59.581
I'm like a bird.

1:22:59.614 --> 1:23:01.148
Not like
the Nelly Furtado song, though.

1:23:01.181 --> 1:23:02.349
It's a terrible song.

1:23:02.382 --> 1:23:03.818
Unless you like it,
then it's totally cool.

1:23:03.852 --> 1:23:06.721
Right. Well, as long as
you don't eat like one.

1:23:08.021 --> 1:23:09.022
A bird.

1:23:09.056 --> 1:23:10.224
I hate when girls don't eat.

1:23:10.257 --> 1:23:11.826
Yeah. No, no, no.
Definitely not.

1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:13.895
That's Brooklyn
with the restrictive diet.

1:23:13.928 --> 1:23:16.263
I love to eat.

1:23:16.296 --> 1:23:20.735
Cool. Well, I'm on the entrepreneur diet.
I'm hungry for everything.

1:23:20.768 --> 1:23:22.804
Did you say you're
an entrepreneur?

1:23:22.837 --> 1:23:24.404
Yeah, pharmaceuticals.

1:23:25.239 --> 1:23:28.242
Great. Um, see you later.

1:23:28.275 --> 1:23:29.677
All right.

1:23:30.612 --> 1:23:31.579
See you.

1:23:33.146 --> 1:23:34.481
He's a fucking drug dealer.

1:23:34.516 --> 1:23:36.483
