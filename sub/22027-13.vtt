WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.370
- This Zach guy
is really cool.

00:03.704 --> 00:05.573
But you are so special to me.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.708
It'll clear up a lot of things,

00:07.741 --> 00:09.110
once I move out.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.611
- I don't want you to leave.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.614
- I'm so excited
to be here today

00:13.647 --> 00:15.383
with Sergeant Trudy Platt.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.287
- Medic!

00:19.320 --> 00:20.654
- Eric Mitchell.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.457
- This could be the start
of a bombing campaign.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.127
- We think that
Eric and Sheri were targeted

00:26.160 --> 00:27.795
for reporting
on the same story.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.763
- Didn't Eric run
the Larry Shepard story?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.599
- White male, 40s, beard.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.167
It matches.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.835
- So you guys blew up
your reporter's career

00:34.868 --> 00:36.170
based on fake news?

00:36.204 --> 00:37.538
- He never forgave us for that.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.240
- This guy's living
in the dark.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.674
I don't know how
we're gonna find him.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.144
- There comes a time
when people pay,

00:43.177 --> 00:44.678
when their actions matter.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.548
-  I got a guy who might know
where Shepard bought his C-4.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.816
- George Lehr.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.551
- We finally got a lead
to Shepard.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.421
We need to get inside Lehr's
house to clone his laptop.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.090
We need your paramedics
to get us in the door.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.459
- You are not endangering
my paramedics.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.694
- Look, I'm just telling you
like it is, Chief.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.430
The city is in
imminent danger.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.832
And if I thought there was
a better way to find this guy,

01:04.865 --> 01:06.367
I wouldn't be here.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.668
- We want to do this, Chief,
no hesitation.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.437
- Yeah, we've been
in this man's house.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.472
He doesn't seem like a danger.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.341
- So they do their jobs
like they always do.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.109
Adam Ruzek goes
in the back door.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.544
While George Lehr
is distracted,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.812
Ruzek installs a cloning
device on Lehr's laptop.

01:18.846 --> 01:21.449
- Which was in his office last
time we were there, I remember.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.351
we'll just make sure that we
keep him in the living room.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.486
- Bing bang boom. Ruzek's out
of there in 10 minutes.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.455
- Why is this laptop
so important?

01:27.488 --> 01:29.857
- Shepard's in contact
with Lehr.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.592
Once we clone the laptop,
we'll have access

01:31.625 --> 01:33.294
to incoming
and outgoing e-mail.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.596
- Yeah, when Shepard
reaches out, we set a trap.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.798
- What if the computer's
not in the office?

01:37.831 --> 01:40.468
- We'll improvise.
It's what we do.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.370
- Look, if there's
even a hint of menace,

01:42.403 --> 01:44.172
we'll be right outside
in a surveillance van

01:44.205 --> 01:45.539
with a go team ready.

01:48.576 --> 01:55.616
*

01:56.784 --> 01:59.520
- I have to be in the van too.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.289
- Fine by me.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.657
- Today. Now.

02:03.691 --> 02:07.928
*

02:07.961 --> 02:10.164
- We'll go get ready.

02:10.198 --> 02:16.637
*

02:16.670 --> 02:18.439
- I won't let anything
happen to them.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.308
- You can't promise me that,
Antonio,

02:20.341 --> 02:22.343
and you know that.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.246
- We know what we're doing,
Chief.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.715
All right, we'll be back
in 30 minutes to pick you up.

02:27.748 --> 02:34.555
*

02:34.588 --> 02:37.191
- If it were us
the Chicago PD needed,

02:37.225 --> 02:39.827
we'd both step forward.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.295
- Yeah.

02:41.329 --> 02:48.536
*

02:51.405 --> 02:54.775
- You gonna be careful
or do I need to worry?

02:54.808 --> 02:58.946
- Antonio's gonna be right
outside. I'll be fine.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.781
- I wish I felt
as good as you do.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.323
- Has the latest for us
in our ongoing coverage

03:09.357 --> 03:10.724
of the serial bombings that--

03:12.025 --> 03:15.829
- Nonstop reporting,
but no real details.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.998
- That scene was chaos.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.833
How's Trudy?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.735
- Unstoppable.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.805
- Voight and Antonio
were just here.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.975
- They're trying
to rope Brett and Dawson

03:28.008 --> 03:30.678
into some sting.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.981
Where are they?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.451
- But we will keep you
up to date

03:37.485 --> 03:39.620
as information comes--

03:42.590 --> 03:44.858
- Hey, the rumor
running around

03:44.892 --> 03:45.993
is that you're going undercover

03:46.026 --> 03:47.461
for Voight and Antonio.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.729
- They want us
to distract a patient of ours

03:48.762 --> 03:50.331
while they plant
something on his computer.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.432
It's simple.
- No.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.467
It is not simple!

03:53.501 --> 03:55.969
Sylvie, you don't know
these guys the way that I do.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.772
They will chew you up and spit
you out without even thinking.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.408
- Antonio is a part of this.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.909
He's not going to do anything
to put his sister

04:01.942 --> 04:03.577
or me in danger.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.513
- Leon wore a wire for them
and he had to move to Florida

04:05.546 --> 04:07.515
for three years
because of retaliation threats.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.016
- I appreciate your concern,
Joe.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.552
- You were on the scene.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.886
You saw with your own eyes

04:12.920 --> 04:14.555
what this guy
has been doing to people.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.989
If we can help find a way
to get to him,

04:16.023 --> 04:17.491
to save more people,

04:17.525 --> 04:18.559
I'm gonna make that choice
every time,

04:18.592 --> 04:19.993
and you would do
the same.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.565
*

04:24.598 --> 04:25.666
- Fine.

04:25.699 --> 04:29.337
Just--just please call me
as soon as it's over, okay?

04:29.370 --> 04:36.544
*

04:44.084 --> 04:46.620
- I got 'em.

04:50.391 --> 04:57.565
*

05:47.548 --> 05:50.050
- Mr. Lehr,
remember us?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.752
- I didn't call
for a paramedic.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.821
- No, yeah, no,
we understand, um...

05:53.854 --> 05:54.822
We do wellness checks

05:54.855 --> 05:57.124
for all of our chronic
heart condition patients,

05:57.157 --> 05:58.692
make sure your
blood pressure's okay,

05:58.726 --> 06:00.060
everything's working
like it should.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.996
- Standard procedure.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.698
- It's not a good time.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.166
- It'll only take a second.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.868
- We'll be in and out
before you can blink.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.570
Promise.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.605
- We're stopping by now because
it would break our hearts

06:11.639 --> 06:13.407
if we had to come by
again later

06:13.441 --> 06:15.108
in an emergency situation.

06:15.142 --> 06:22.516
*

06:39.500 --> 06:41.602
- You taking
your heart medication?

06:41.635 --> 06:44.438
- Yeah, 40 milligrams
every night.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.039
- Here, have a seat.
Roll your sleeve up.

06:46.073 --> 06:50.778
*

06:51.945 --> 06:53.146
- Uh... Statins.

06:53.180 --> 07:00.554
*

07:03.824 --> 07:05.225
- All right, I'm in position.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.094
- All right,
you're clear for entry.

07:07.127 --> 07:14.134
*

07:18.205 --> 07:22.175
- Hey, Mr. Lehr, will you roll
that sleeve up for me?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.911
- George.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.814
- Okay, George.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.949
Just relax
while I check your pressure.

07:28.982 --> 07:35.989
*

07:50.070 --> 07:53.974
*

07:54.007 --> 07:56.243
Okay.
118/70.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.878
Perfectly normal.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.714
- Well, I really have
a lot of work to do, so...

08:00.748 --> 08:02.550
- Oh, yeah, of course,
of course, no problem.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.884
Um, we're just
gonna take a listen

08:03.917 --> 08:05.853
to your heart sounds
real quick.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.155
- And how long
is this gonna take?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.123
- Uh, just a minute.

08:10.157 --> 08:15.729
*

08:15.763 --> 08:18.566
Breathe in.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.967
- Out.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.037
- That's it.
Do it again.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.274
- Good, again.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.178
*

08:31.211 --> 08:33.146
- Okay, okay, that's it.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.115
I'm done. I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Oh, well,

08:35.148 --> 08:37.150
we have to get
your blood sugar.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.853
But since it seems like you've
gotten your medical license

08:39.887 --> 08:41.889
since the last time we saw you,
I guess we can pass.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.657
- Actually, you know what,
Sylvie, why don't you mark down

08:43.691 --> 08:45.258
that the patient is refusing
his wellness check.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.228
If anything happens to him in
the future, it won't be on us.

08:51.264 --> 08:57.871
*

08:57.905 --> 08:58.972
In.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.341
*

09:01.374 --> 09:02.576
Out.

09:04.077 --> 09:07.981
*

09:08.015 --> 09:10.283
- I don't know.

09:10.317 --> 09:17.290
*

09:18.992 --> 09:21.194
*

09:23.096 --> 09:24.598
- I don't know.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.801
*

09:32.105 --> 09:33.807
We're done, we can go.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.108
- Wait.

09:35.142 --> 09:42.182
*

09:49.690 --> 09:49.990
.

09:50.023 --> 09:50.523
- Okay. We gotta call it.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.760
I gotta protect my paramedics.

09:52.793 --> 09:53.794
- Just sit tight, Chief.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.963
We're this close.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.164
- Edmund.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.331
- It's not him,
it's not Shepard.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.836
- This is my brother, Edmund.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.304
These are a couple
of paramedics.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.640
They want to do
some kind of wellness check.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.077
- In the office.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.079
- Ruzek, get out of there
immediately.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.215
- Come on, come on...

10:15.248 --> 10:17.050
- So I really do have
a lot of work to do.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.852
Can we just wrap this--
- Hey, Edmund.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.353
*

10:20.387 --> 10:23.356
Uh, heart disease
is hereditary.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.992
So if you haven't
had a checkup in a while,

10:25.025 --> 10:25.993
I highly recommend it.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.895
*

10:27.928 --> 10:30.731
- I'll keep that in mind.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.932
- Great.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.967
*

10:34.001 --> 10:36.369
Okay, well, Mr. Lehr,
your pressure is good,

10:36.403 --> 10:38.706
your blood sugar's normal,
your lung sounds are clear.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.941
We are pleased
that you're doing better.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.710
- Totally pleased.

10:42.743 --> 10:48.315
*

10:48.348 --> 10:50.718
- Come on.

10:50.751 --> 10:57.691
*

10:57.725 --> 10:58.826
- We got it.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.462
*

11:02.495 --> 11:03.697
- They're clear.

11:03.731 --> 11:10.771
*

11:19.780 --> 11:21.882
- Just heard from Dawson.
They're both fine.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.350
Went off without a hitch.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.421
- I told Brett to call me
the moment they were safe.

11:28.455 --> 11:32.025
- I'm sure she assumed
I'd tell you.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.762
- Thanks, Captain.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.899
- Yeah, just, uh, worried.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.234
It's all good.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.911
- Oh.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.181
Zach wants me
to meet his sister.

11:54.214 --> 11:58.819
She's coming to town,
and it's a whole to-do.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.056
- Two days ago, you were saying
that you wanted to move out

12:03.090 --> 12:04.792
because it's getting
weird with me,

12:04.825 --> 12:07.427
and now, you're worried
about his sister?

12:07.460 --> 12:10.798
- I know,
but meeting his family,

12:10.831 --> 12:14.234
I mean, he might as well come
with a priest and ten limos,

12:14.267 --> 12:17.104
because that's what that means.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.338
- Okay.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.041
- Look, I'm just--
I'm just gonna tell him

12:21.074 --> 12:24.077
to tap the brakes,
just a little.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.480
- I'll let you work on that.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.516
- Mm-hmm.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.525
- I gotta tell you,
your paramedics did great.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.293
- Yeah, there's
no surprise there.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.362
They walk into unpredictable
situations every day,

12:42.395 --> 12:44.164
and they do it
without a weapon.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.299
I was never worried about their
ability to handle themselves,

12:46.333 --> 12:50.170
but thanks for
keeping them safe.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.205
- I know you had
your reservations.

12:52.239 --> 12:56.043
I want you to know I appreciate
you helping us out.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.913
- Well, we sort through
all of George Lehr's e-mails.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.817
He tries to make contact with
Shepard, now we'll be ready.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.519
- I will say I'm ready to help
in any way we can.

13:06.553 --> 13:10.157
Our people will have
their antennae up.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.860
- Much obliged.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.395
- Thanks.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.873
It got a little
too close for comfort,

13:25.906 --> 13:27.975
but they both handled
themselves with aplomb.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.011
Chief
just used the word "aplomb."

13:36.649 --> 13:39.953
- Squad Three, explosion,
8412 South Kedvale...

13:39.987 --> 13:41.321
- Explosion.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.256
- That's a residential
neighborhood.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.892
- Uh-huh.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.897
*

13:52.933 --> 13:57.871
*

13:57.905 --> 14:00.273
- You get the feeling Antonio
doesn't know what he's doing?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.978
- Well, he gets into
a bind on his own case.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.647
He's gotta call Brett and
Dawson to do his dirty work?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.316
It's like Leon.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.884
Antonio had him wear a wire.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.385
It cost him three years
of his life.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.187
- Leon's doing good now!

14:14.221 --> 14:16.023
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean--

14:16.056 --> 14:17.624
- Cruz, you need to focus.

14:17.657 --> 14:24.631
*

14:27.667 --> 14:32.405
*

14:32.439 --> 14:34.607
Hey, Cap, Tony,
check under the hood.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.344
Make sure that fire doesn't
flare up again.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.979
- I saw the whole thing.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.580
Janet came out of her house.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.582
I-I waved to her
like I always do.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.952
We've shared a lawn
for 20-something years.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.386
She--she gets in her car,

14:46.419 --> 14:48.621
backs out of the driveway,
puts it in gear to go forward,

14:48.655 --> 14:51.058
and an explosion
like you've never heard.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.093
- Okay, ma'am.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.395
You stay here; the police
are gonna want to talk to you.

14:55.428 --> 15:02.635
*

15:25.425 --> 15:26.960
- I was on my way home,

15:26.994 --> 15:28.461
heard the word "explosion"
on the scanner.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.263
So...Intelligence is
a little jumpy right now.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.731
- Yeah, for good reason.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.467
Found this
underneath the chassis.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.169
It's the same material
as before.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.371
- This is not just some kid
making a pipe bomb

15:38.405 --> 15:39.406
off the internet.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.141
This is professional work.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.210
*

15:43.243 --> 15:47.080
- Excuse me, guys.
- Yep.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.482
All right, will you find him,

15:49.516 --> 15:51.418
tell him I'm at
8412 South Kedvale?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.452
And that this is our guy.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.721
He's struck again.

16:02.129 --> 16:02.262
.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.096
- So the woman in the car
is Janet Powell.

16:05.132 --> 16:08.235
She's the mother-in-law
of our man, Larry Shepard.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.636
- We were looking
at media targets,

16:09.669 --> 16:11.338
not extended family members.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.773
- Which means he's escalating
and twice as dangerous.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.509
- The laptop this morning,
did it help?

16:16.543 --> 16:18.078
- We're hopeful.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.446
I mean, if Shepard
requires more supplies,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.081
he's gonna have to reach out.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.350
I also got Antonio sitting
on George Lehr's house

16:23.383 --> 16:26.386
in case he tries
to make personal contact.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.355
- Hey, do you need us
for anything else, Chief?

16:28.388 --> 16:31.091
- No, you guys
can pack up and go.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.493
- Squad Three,
back it up, let's go.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.794
- Copy that, Lieutenant.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.229
- Chief, look,
if the firehouse responds

16:36.263 --> 16:37.664
to any fire or haz-mat calls

16:37.697 --> 16:39.532
where anything seems unusual,

16:39.566 --> 16:41.034
even if you just get a bad hit,

16:41.068 --> 16:42.535
give us a call, we'll come
out to the scene.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.037
- Understood.
- All right.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.405
- Chief.
- Thanks.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.640
- You're welcome.

16:50.677 --> 16:58.051
*

17:00.853 --> 17:02.589
- I tell her
this is dangerous,

17:02.622 --> 17:04.624
but she doesn't
listen to me!

17:04.657 --> 17:06.259
I tried to tell her about Leon,

17:06.293 --> 17:08.495
but she basically ignored it.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.165
I tell her, "Please,
call me as soon as it's done."

17:12.199 --> 17:13.666
What'd she do?
Nothing!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.602
Dawson calls Casey and says

17:15.635 --> 17:17.804
tell him to tell me
not to worry?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.539
- Do you want her
to report back to you

17:19.572 --> 17:22.175
after every call
that 61 goes on?

17:22.209 --> 17:23.743
- Don't give me that,
all right?

17:23.776 --> 17:25.545
Just because things
get dangerous

17:25.578 --> 17:27.114
when the bells go off,

17:27.147 --> 17:30.383
doesn't mean that she has
to go looking for trouble.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.818
- Hide me.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.459
- No, I don't, but do you think
you'd have this reaction

17:39.492 --> 17:42.595
if there wasn't this history
between Brett and Antonio?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.164
This has nothing to do with

17:44.197 --> 17:45.598
whatever the hell's
going on between them.

17:45.632 --> 17:49.569
- Yeah, okay, but this thing
went off without a hitch.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.870
She's back safe and sound,

17:50.903 --> 17:55.408
so maybe now
just focus on that.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.776
Okay?

18:01.381 --> 18:03.816
- Captain.
- Captain.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.391
- I told Brett that I come
in here and I lower the blinds

18:11.424 --> 18:12.825
whenever I'm trying
to avoid someone.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.361
- Yeah, I'm always like,
"Where's Dawson?"

18:14.394 --> 18:15.495
And everyone's like,
"I don't know."

18:15.528 --> 18:16.629
Now I know.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.331
- So you just
go about your usual,

18:18.365 --> 18:21.501
and we're gonna hang out in
here for the rest of the shift.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.870
- Seems like you haven't put
too much thought into it.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.273
- You're right, we haven't.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.143
- A little.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.812
Yeah, pretty much.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.914
- He's your roommate.
- Yeah.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.485
And he's ticked about us
helping Antonio.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.589
I'm gonna go down
to the blue office

18:42.622 --> 18:45.525
that I should've moved
into when I had the chance.

18:51.931 --> 18:55.435
Brett, I've known Joe
for a long time.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.938
He wears his emotions
on his sleeve because he cares.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.308
There's nothing surface
about him.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.154
- Severide!

19:18.225 --> 19:20.827
They say the victim today
was the mother-in-law

19:20.860 --> 19:23.696
of the prime suspect.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.232
- Apparently.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.300
- Yeah, that don't seem
a little off to you?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.236
- It didn't fit the pattern
according to Halsted.

19:29.269 --> 19:33.373
- Yeah, that's what
I'm thinking about.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.474
Patterns.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.976
Now, I know I don't have as
much arson experience

19:37.009 --> 19:38.311
as you or your father,

19:38.345 --> 19:41.348
but I seem to remember IEDs.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.950
They require a certain amount
of practice

19:43.983 --> 19:45.918
before someone deploys them
out in the wild.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.755
- Yeah, theoretically,
the arsonist wants to test

19:48.788 --> 19:50.290
the power of the explosives

19:50.323 --> 19:52.892
so they don't fall short
of their goal, I guess.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.461
- Right.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.829
So there might have been
a trial run or two.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.466
- Some place that didn't raise
any red flags at the time.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.467
- Yeah. Go on.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.870
- So if there's a workspace
or a practice area--

20:03.903 --> 20:07.840
- How do we go about
finding that?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.677
- I got an idea.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.678
- Captain Hubble.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.280
- Oh, Chief Boden, Kelly,

20:13.313 --> 20:14.481
let me guess, you guys are
here about the bombings.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.748
- Yeah, we are.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.317
- Don't worry, I've got
my best people on it.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.651
The physical evidence
is strong,

20:18.685 --> 20:20.587
and we're preserving
every last bit of it.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.355
If CPD has a suspect, we will
connect him to the attacks.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.690
- That's the problem.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.325
They don't have
any suspect in custody.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.593
- We might be able
to help you with that.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.494
- Okay.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.861
- Do you have a way to sort

20:28.895 --> 20:30.363
through arson calls
by neighborhood?

20:30.397 --> 20:31.664
- Sure, we can sort
through every call

20:31.698 --> 20:33.433
CFD's responded to
in the last 20 years,

20:33.466 --> 20:35.635
but it requires some
heavy database management.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.337
Why?

20:37.370 --> 20:38.871
- We need to look at any calls
within a two mile area

20:38.905 --> 20:41.007
of 4215 South Morgan.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.309
- Shepard's residence.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.544
- Going back
maybe a year or two.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.613
- You guys understand
a lot of people are waiting

20:46.646 --> 20:47.780
on this report.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.683
- Look, we know
this is a big ask.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.851
But we wouldn't bother you

20:51.884 --> 20:53.286
unless we thought
it could pay off.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.890
*

20:57.924 --> 20:59.292
- Hey, guys.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.760
Let's hit pause for a bit.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.363
We're gonna attack this
from a different angle.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.697
- Thanks, Hubble.
- Yeah,

21:04.731 --> 21:06.466
anything to stop this guy.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.836
- I thought you
were going home.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.771
- No rest for the weary.
What's up?

21:13.105 --> 21:14.474
- Yeah, he's in his office
with Antonio.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.310
- Good.
He's gonna want to hear this.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.549
So I've dealt
with my fair share

21:22.582 --> 21:24.417
of arsonists
over the years.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.985
And the thing that
a lot of them have in common

21:26.018 --> 21:29.322
is they build up
to the first blaze,

21:29.356 --> 21:30.757
the first bomb.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.025
- Yeah, like that guy
that targeted your sister.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.627
- Gish.
- Right.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.629
- You shot him.
- In an elevator stall, yeah.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.898
- Yeah, except this guy
isn't a typical arsonist.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.533
He's a journalist.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.869
He just snapped when the story
he was working on

21:42.902 --> 21:44.371
doubled back on him.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.606
- Still he chose bombs,
he chose fire,

21:46.639 --> 21:48.408
he didn't chose a gun.
- Mm.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.544
- So maybe that's something
that he built up to.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.112
- And George Lehr
helped him do it.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.115
- Right. He doesn't want
to practice in his home,

21:56.148 --> 21:57.717
in case someone notices.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.552
- Yeah, we checked his house.
It's clean.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.954
- Right, but twice
in the last six months,

22:01.988 --> 22:06.459
the CFD has been called
out to this property.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.695
This is two blocks away
from his residence.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.997
It's got a nice little
work shed in the back.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.801
And the neighbors, they phoned
it in when they saw smoke.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.135
- I was on one of these calls.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.470
The man that answered the door

22:17.504 --> 22:19.739
said it was just
a little experiment

22:19.772 --> 22:20.940
that had gone awry.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.443
He said he was a carpenter
or something.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.812
I didn't get a good look
at him, he had a hoodie on.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.448
Thought it was weird,
but I didn't flag it.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.749
We get a lot of false alarms.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.452
- I couldn't pick him
out of a lineup,

22:32.485 --> 22:33.953
but yeah, it could've been.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.155
- Let's see who owns this
property on West Patterson.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.624
- All right, I'm on it.

22:37.657 --> 22:40.159
- Antonio, let's roll
on this address.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.429
I want to see who
answers the door.

22:42.462 --> 22:46.633
Hey. Thank you. Thanks.
- Yep.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.668
- Hey, Sarge, this address
on West Patterson,

22:48.701 --> 22:50.537
it's owned by a company
named Starlight Properties.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.904
They got a PO box.
- Hey.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.039
You say Starlight?

22:53.072 --> 22:55.141
- Yeah.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.076
- There's an e-mail
on Lehr's laptop

22:57.109 --> 22:58.711
from Starlight Properties.

22:58.745 --> 22:59.679
- This is our guy.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.880
- All right,
everybody gear up.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.048
We'll see you there.

23:05.084 --> 23:12.459
*

23:26.906 --> 23:28.608
*

23:28.641 --> 23:31.410
- Move it.
- Let's go.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.782
- Seek, seek.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.961
- Hit him.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.863
*

23:50.897 --> 23:54.166
- Stairs!

23:54.200 --> 23:55.902
- Clear.

23:55.935 --> 24:03.142
*

24:05.612 --> 24:09.048
- There it is,
back there.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.783
*

24:10.817 --> 24:11.951
- Police!

24:11.984 --> 24:16.923
*

24:16.956 --> 24:20.059
- Sarge, you want
to wait for a sniffer?

24:20.092 --> 24:27.500
*

24:47.186 --> 24:47.554
.

24:47.587 --> 24:48.154
- Here they are.
Right here.

24:51.624 --> 24:52.792
So what do we got?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.728
*

24:55.762 --> 24:58.030
- Same materials.

24:58.064 --> 25:01.768
Soldering on the initiator
matches the signature.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.771
Yeah, that's the same type
used on that car

25:04.804 --> 25:06.873
on South Kedvale.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.641
- All right,
rip that house open.

25:08.675 --> 25:12.912
Find me a clue tells me who,
when, where he'll strike next.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.781
- Copy that.
- Hey, Chief,

25:14.814 --> 25:16.583
mind sticking around for a bit?

25:16.616 --> 25:18.150
May need your expertise.
- Sure.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.251
- Appreciate it.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.587
- Go back to the house,

25:20.620 --> 25:21.988
let Casey know I'm gonna
assist here.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.256
- Yeah, you got it, Chief.
- Okay.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.929
- Sylvie.
- Oh!

25:29.962 --> 25:32.331
What are you doing?
Don't scare me like that.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.134
- The better question
is what are you doing

25:35.167 --> 25:37.570
in Casey's office?

25:37.604 --> 25:38.971
- Nothing.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.741
Sometimes I go in there to...

25:41.774 --> 25:43.643
You know.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.844
- Assume I don't know.

25:44.877 --> 25:48.648
- Okay, fine,
I'm hiding out.

25:48.681 --> 25:51.684
- Okay, that's just wrong.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.653
The last thing
I want you to think

25:53.686 --> 25:55.154
is that you can't
talk to me.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.890
- Well, I tried, and you were
all in my face this morning.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.826
- Because I care about you,
Sylvie.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.028
And before you get all nervous,

26:02.061 --> 26:05.331
I mean that as a friend.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.933
I had my chance with you,

26:06.966 --> 26:10.302
it didn't work out,
I fully understand that.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.204
But what we've had since then,

26:12.238 --> 26:15.775
this friendship,
that's what's important to me.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.880
- Me too.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.683
*

26:23.716 --> 26:25.384
I'm sorry.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.887
I love living with Crotis.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.322
I don't want
to jeopardize that,

26:30.356 --> 26:31.858
but there are gonna be times

26:31.891 --> 26:33.660
when I'm gonna do
what I think is right.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.361
- Understood.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.996
You have my complete support.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.899
*

26:39.932 --> 26:41.367
- Thanks.

26:41.400 --> 26:48.641
*

26:57.249 --> 26:59.752
- Ooh, I like the sight
of this.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.087
- Yep.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.289
- My man's got his own
corner office.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.025
- I'm just using it while you
and Brett play hide and seek.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.927
- Hiding, not seeking.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.395
And we're done.
We're good to go.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.830
- Good.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.865
Then we can get things
back to normal.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.072
- Hey.

27:24.010 --> 27:27.714
- Cap said that you and Boden

27:27.747 --> 27:30.717
went hunting for some bomber.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.852
- I was trying to help
where we can.

27:32.885 --> 27:38.457
Turns out, Boden and I found
the psycho's practice workshop.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.293
- Yeah, Boden's still there.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.197
- With all the craziness
this shift,

27:45.231 --> 27:48.701
Dawson and Brett
walking pretty much

27:48.735 --> 27:50.336
right into the lion's den,

27:50.369 --> 27:54.373
I don't want you
doing anything stupid.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.876
I would say that we don't know
what this guy's capable of,

27:56.909 --> 27:59.746
but we do.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.715
- So what you're saying...

28:02.749 --> 28:05.151
Is you're worried about me?

28:05.184 --> 28:09.889
- All I'm saying is
firefighter to firefighter,

28:09.922 --> 28:12.725
be careful.

28:12.759 --> 28:16.295
- Because you don't want
anything to happen to me.

28:16.328 --> 28:19.231
- If you would just set
your ego aside for a minute,

28:19.265 --> 28:22.034
you would see that
I am actually offering you

28:22.068 --> 28:25.304
some very sage advice.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.406
- Uh, Stella...

28:33.312 --> 28:35.047
- Hey, man.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.819
- Hey.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.053
- I got your message.
- Yes.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.755
- You're bailing
on tomorrow night?

28:42.789 --> 28:44.123
- Yeah, I--

28:44.156 --> 28:46.292
I just, you know, with
the city being on high alert,

28:46.325 --> 28:49.061
I just figured I'd stick around
and catch a double shift.

28:49.095 --> 28:53.332
Just in case
they need the extra hands.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.467
- Huh.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.305
- No, I just thought
you wanted to go.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.873
- No, I do, I--

29:00.907 --> 29:02.141
That's why I was just--

29:02.174 --> 29:04.110
I was just feeling you out,
and, uh--

29:04.143 --> 29:08.414
Look, I can see that this
is really important to you,

29:08.447 --> 29:10.516
so I will tell Chief

29:10.549 --> 29:13.419
to stick to the schedule.
Forget I called.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.787
- Okay.

29:14.821 --> 29:15.988
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.390
- Perfect.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.970
I am gonna let you
off the hook.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.108
- No, that's not what I was--

29:36.142 --> 29:38.845
- Look, I'm a lot of things;
I'm not blind, Stella.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.147
There's something going on
with your roommate,

29:41.180 --> 29:44.383
which is cool with me.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.918
Hell, we just started
going out.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.286
- Zach--
- No, it is, it is,

29:47.319 --> 29:52.291
but it's your life,
and I get it.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.393
But...

29:54.426 --> 29:58.397
See, I think what I need to do
is take a big step back.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.366
And if, uh...

30:00.399 --> 30:03.202
You get to a different place
in your life, then...

30:03.235 --> 30:05.571
*

30:05.604 --> 30:08.040
We'll see.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.542
- I think you're overreacting.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.412
*

30:13.445 --> 30:16.615
- I'm not.

30:16.648 --> 30:24.056
*

30:29.028 --> 30:30.229
- Upton.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.098
- We got something.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.166
- It's from George Lehr's
cloned laptop.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.302
He just sent
an e-mail to Shepard.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.105
There it is.
"Pick up the package at 7P.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.439
We'll be set for tonight."

30:40.472 --> 30:41.307
What's 7P?

30:41.340 --> 30:45.044
7:00 p.m.?
I don't know.

30:45.077 --> 30:48.214
- Could be a location--
a locker or storage facility.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.316
- Yeah, but pick up the
package. What package?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.018
- It's gotta be an explosive.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.485
We have to intercept it.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.121
Let's go.

30:58.157 --> 31:05.364
*

31:20.479 --> 31:22.614
- Clear.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.952
- Clear. Forward.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.955
- Hands up, Lehr.
Lehr, hands up!

31:28.988 --> 31:30.189
Real slow, okay?

31:30.222 --> 31:33.960
I want you to put your
hands up--

31:44.003 --> 31:47.106
- It'll all be over tonight!

31:47.139 --> 31:49.075
- Don't you move an inch.

31:49.108 --> 31:53.545
*

31:53.579 --> 31:55.014
Sarge?

31:55.047 --> 31:56.415
Yeah, we have Lehr in custody,

31:56.448 --> 31:58.117
but we believe
he's armed Shepard

31:58.150 --> 31:59.318
and means
to strike tonight.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.953
- Yeah, well
you bring his ass in

32:00.987 --> 32:02.521
and throw him in the cage.

32:02.554 --> 32:06.458
*

32:06.492 --> 32:09.561
- Sarge, we got something
in the basement.

32:09.595 --> 32:14.733
*

32:14.766 --> 32:17.236
Hey.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.338
Sheri Hamilton,

32:19.371 --> 32:21.273
the mother-in-law,

32:21.307 --> 32:24.276
Eric Mitchell,
the mailbox victim,

32:24.310 --> 32:26.012
and this is the guy Upton
and I interviewed.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.247
It's Allen Tullis;
he's Shepard's editor.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.681
Shepard accosted him
on a commuter train

32:29.715 --> 32:32.318
two days before
the first incident.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.287
- "Chicago Telegraph."

32:39.558 --> 32:40.959
- He's next.

32:45.998 --> 32:46.165
.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.099
- 5021 Squad emergency.
Roll the bomb squad

32:49.168 --> 32:52.004
to the Chicago Telegraph
building immediately.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.539
I got a possible IED.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.408
Advise additional responding
to set a two block perimeter.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.710
- Roll CFD to the
Chicago Telegraph building

32:58.744 --> 33:01.013
on a box alarm!

33:06.785 --> 33:14.193
*

33:14.493 --> 33:17.629
- Okay, folks, single file.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.231
*

33:19.265 --> 33:21.100
Watch the vehicles.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.570
There you go.
Keep moving.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.705
Let's go, folks.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.140
- You ever get
that itch, Wallace?

33:29.308 --> 33:31.477
- Yeah, you know, the feeling
something ain't right?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.644
- Yeah.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.714
- Yeah, well, I got it now.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.483
Hey, security.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.551
- We got the call and we are
proceeding with the evacuation.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.088
- All right, good. Listen,
can you point out Allen Tullis?

33:42.121 --> 33:43.555
We need to talk to him.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.058
- Allen's not here yet.
Comes in late on Fridays.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.593
- Yeah, that's right.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.629
- Yeah, he takes the train in.
His regular routine.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.265
- Shepard accosted Tullis
on the train.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.067
He knew where he'd be
and what time he'd be there.

33:55.101 --> 33:58.537
- "CT." Not "Chicago
Telegraph," Chicago Transit!

33:58.570 --> 34:00.172
- You know what station
Tullis uses?

34:00.206 --> 34:03.675
- Uh, Randolph Street.
- Thank you.

34:03.709 --> 34:07.313
- Casey, divert the call to the
Randolph Street train station.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.215
Possible bomb attempt.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.118
- Chief says
Randolph Street station!

34:12.151 --> 34:15.754
- Squad Three, Ambo 61,
Randolph Street station!

34:15.787 --> 34:19.091
- Copy that.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.494
- Evacuate!
We need to evacuate!

34:22.528 --> 34:25.297
- Everyone evacuate!
Out of this station!

34:25.331 --> 34:26.832
- We have a bomb threat.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.401
- I didn't get a call!
- It's happening fast.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.103
- K570 to rail control!

34:31.137 --> 34:32.704
CFD's on the scene,
reporting a 1090.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.674
They're requesting a station
shutdown while we wait for CPD.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.476
- Get out of the way, please!

34:37.509 --> 34:39.778
- Move to the right, please!
- Stay to the right!

34:39.811 --> 34:41.813
- All right, everybody!
We need you off the train

34:41.847 --> 34:44.383
and out of the platform
right now! Let's go!

34:44.416 --> 34:46.185
- Orderly manner, please.
Thank you!

34:46.218 --> 34:48.254
Upstairs, upstairs.
- Nice and easy, slow down!

34:48.287 --> 34:50.656
*

34:50.689 --> 34:51.790
- Let's go, folks!

34:51.823 --> 34:53.259
- Come on!

34:53.292 --> 34:57.496
*

34:57.529 --> 34:59.531
Let's go! Let's go!

34:59.565 --> 35:02.401
*

35:02.434 --> 35:05.271
Out of the platform right now,
let's go, let's go!

35:05.304 --> 35:06.238
Come on!

35:06.272 --> 35:08.707
- Quickly, everybody, quickly.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.909
- Sir!

35:10.942 --> 35:13.379
- Hey, we're evacuating, sir.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.181
*

35:16.282 --> 35:18.550
- Journalism needs to be
accountable.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.454
- Out of the way! Move!
- Out of the way!

35:22.488 --> 35:24.523
*

35:24.556 --> 35:26.358
- Move! Move!

35:26.392 --> 35:28.794
- Out of the way!

35:28.827 --> 35:30.296
- Out of the way,
out of the way.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.730
Get out of the way!
- Come on!

35:31.763 --> 35:34.333
- You even twitch,
I'll blow your head off.

35:34.366 --> 35:41.407
*

35:47.679 --> 35:49.315
Here, throw him in my car.

35:49.348 --> 35:52.451
- You got it.
Let's go.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.186
*

35:54.220 --> 35:56.388
Well, that was nice work,
fellas.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.757
- A little too much excitement
for one day.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.859
- That's what keeps
Chicago interesting.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.761
*

36:02.794 --> 36:03.862
- Did you guys give
your statements?

36:03.895 --> 36:05.731
- Multiple times.

36:05.764 --> 36:06.932
- That guy had
enough C-4 on him

36:06.965 --> 36:08.334
to take out
a whole city block.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.702
You did good today,
both of you.

36:10.736 --> 36:11.870
- Yeah.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.372
- All right, Chief.
- Okay.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.741
*

36:15.774 --> 36:16.942
Come on.

36:16.975 --> 36:23.682
*

36:23.715 --> 36:26.418
- You two were cool
under fire today.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.520
- That's every day,
mi hermano.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.589
- Well, we appreciate it,

36:30.622 --> 36:31.823
sincerely.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.260
I mean, that laptop
toppled the dominoes.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.962
What about
our patient, George Lehr?

36:36.995 --> 36:38.297
What happens to him?

36:38.330 --> 36:39.798
- Next time
he needs a paramedic,

36:39.831 --> 36:41.267
it's gonna be in a prison yard.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.768
- Good riddance.
- Yeah.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.636
Salud.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.272
You two missed your calling.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.873
I'm gonna get you CPD badges.

36:52.478 --> 36:59.518
*

37:04.690 --> 37:11.630
*

37:13.932 --> 37:18.470
*

37:23.442 --> 37:25.811
- How far does a girl have
to go before you notice her?

37:30.349 --> 37:33.752
- I was thinking about it.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.254
Yeah, Zach broke up with me.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.825
- I thought you were
just tapping the brakes.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.793
- Yeah, well, he decided

37:41.827 --> 37:45.263
to go ahead and put it in park.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.437
- Let's stay in.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.707
- Yeah, just you and me.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.579
*

38:00.612 --> 38:03.682
- If she's pretty enough, she
doesn't have to go anywhere.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.817
She just has to be.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.686
*

38:07.719 --> 38:10.522
- Pay attention to me.

38:12.691 --> 38:15.694
- I'm not exactly on
the other side of the room.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.797
- Your mind is.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.999
And when I want a man,
I want all of him.

38:21.032 --> 38:28.407
*

38:41.052 --> 38:41.387
.

38:43.955 --> 38:51.363
