00:56.823 --> 00:59.895
Wow, it was barely
an inch when we went in.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.434
It's so beautiful.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.966
It's good,
it's good, it's good.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.464
I can't feel my fingers.

01:38.398 --> 01:39.809
Thank you.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.255
You do not like this song.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.961
You have to turn it off.

02:15.668 --> 02:19.138
I'm married to a cheeser!
Please, stop!

02:19.639 --> 02:21.744
You love it.
Say you love it. Stop! Ow!

02:21.808 --> 02:23.287
Stop it!

02:23.943 --> 02:25.183
You love that song.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.848
Oh, Leo.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.155
Hey, I have this theory.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.320
Mmm-hmm.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.921
That a girl's guaranteed to get
preggers if she does it in a car.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.631
What?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.369
Mmm-hmm.

02:41.361 --> 02:45.138
<i>I have a theory, too.
My theory is about moments.</i>

02:47.300 --> 02:48.677
<i>Moments of impact.</i>

03:46.492 --> 03:49.063
<i>My theory is that
these moments of impact,</i>

03:50.063 --> 03:52.270
<i>these flashes of high intensity</i>

03:52.365 --> 03:54.504
<i>that completely turn
our lives upside down,</i>

03:54.767 --> 03:57.373
<i>actually end up
defining who we are.</i>

04:02.275 --> 04:03.686
Thanks.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.915
Next in line.

04:11.451 --> 04:14.921
<i>One of my absolute
favorite moments.</i>

04:19.791 --> 04:21.100
Oh!

04:22.695 --> 04:24.106
You forgot your permit.

04:25.365 --> 04:29.871
Yeah. Well, I just sort of come
here to enjoy the two-hour line.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.438
The permit's sort of a bonus.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.982
The Art Institute.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.453
You work there?

04:39.545 --> 04:40.751
No, I'm a student.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.658
I'm Paige.

04:46.886 --> 04:49.264
I'm sorry. I'm Leo.

04:49.322 --> 04:52.235
Well, thank you for this, Leo.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.134
You know what, I noticed, in a
totally non-threatening way,

04:57.230 --> 04:59.073
we have the same RPP zone.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.005
Is that right?

05:01.768 --> 05:02.940
Yup.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.510
Hmm.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.250
You have impressive
powers of observation.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.684
Yes.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.113
What's an RPP zone?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.787
Residential
permit parking zone.

05:14.747 --> 05:15.987
Oh.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.028
That sounds intimate.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.758
Yeah.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.928
Okay.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.202
What I was thinking is that...

05:28.461 --> 05:30.270
I think we owe it
to ourselves, really,

05:30.330 --> 05:31.604
to maybe get a drink,

05:32.031 --> 05:35.706
out of respect for our
zone compatibility and all.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.482
Okay.
Okay?

05:41.708 --> 05:42.812
Mmm-hmm.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.053
All right, okay.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.059
After you.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.228
Pick a hand. Pick a hand.
Pick a hand.

06:00.326 --> 06:02.135
That one.
Here we go.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.007
Mmm.
Mmm.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.669
This is good.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.494
Let me know if you
need anything else.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.309
Oh.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.383
Oh.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.065
Mmm.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.030
Did you just fart?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.364
No.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.198
Oh.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.932
Maybe a little.

07:49.368 --> 07:51.279
That is so twisted.

07:52.705 --> 07:54.514
But totally romantic.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.190
God, I'm so in love
with you, it's insane.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.292
<i>As you know,
your wife's CT scan</i>

08:06.352 --> 08:08.025
<i>showed
intracranial hemorrhaging.</i>

08:08.120 --> 08:10.828
We purposely keep patients
with traumatic brain injuries

08:10.923 --> 08:13.563
in a comatose state in order
to calm their systems

08:13.693 --> 08:18.039
and allow the brain time to heal
itself while the swelling subsides.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.935
And then we slowly
wean them off it. Now...

08:21.033 --> 08:24.537
<i>The thing is, each one
of us is the sum total of</i>

08:24.604 --> 08:27.517
<i>every moment that
we've ever experienced,</i>

08:27.573 --> 08:30.281
<i>with all the people
we've ever known.</i>

08:43.222 --> 08:46.533
<i>And it's these moments
that become our history.</i>

08:46.626 --> 08:50.733
<i>Like our own personal greatest
hits of memories that we play</i>

08:50.796 --> 08:54.107
<i>and replay in our minds
over and over again.</i>

08:59.272 --> 09:01.047
Aren't you hungry?

09:01.874 --> 09:03.717
Hey.
Hi.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.448
What you doing?
Nothing.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.752
Really?
No.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.383
What's that?
Nothing.

09:09.448 --> 09:11.394
Oh, nothing?
Food's ready.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.722
Look, if you keep
feeding that fleabag,

09:13.786 --> 09:17.393
it's gonna keep coming
back and I'm allergic.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.161
Like you claim to be
allergic to cilantro?

09:20.259 --> 09:21.602
I can't stand cilantro.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.572
Exactly.
But you're not allergic.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.007
Does anybody want strawberries I
bought at the farmers' market?

09:26.098 --> 09:27.168
Buying groceries, bad sign.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.301
What?

09:28.401 --> 09:29.505
And we all know
what that means.

09:29.602 --> 09:30.672
I like her.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.950
She's like our mascot.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.582
Thanks, I think.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.314
I would rather have her than that
ferret you tried to make us adopt.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.583
And she makes great coffee.
Let's keep her.

09:39.645 --> 09:40.919
Thank you.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.254
- Have some.
- Thank you.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.687
"Movie"? I think you
spelled "movie" wrong.

09:46.852 --> 09:47.956
No.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.438
Told you.

09:57.697 --> 09:58.903
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.274
I vow to help you love life,

10:04.370 --> 10:07.078
to always hold you
with tenderness,

10:07.540 --> 10:10.544
and to have the patience
that love demands.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.321
To speak when words are needed

10:13.613 --> 10:16.594
and to share the silence
when they're not.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.787
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.762
And to live within
the warmth of your heart

10:24.824 --> 10:26.599
and always call it home.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.297
Wow, you set the bar
kind of high.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.305
Did you write
your vows on a menu?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.902
Yeah. Why?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.685
I vow to fiercely love you

10:49.415 --> 10:52.624
in all your forms,
now and forever.

10:53.953 --> 10:58.026
I promise to never forget that
this is a once-in-a-lifetime love.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.005
And to always know in the
deepest part of my soul

11:05.598 --> 11:09.307
that no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,

11:10.936 --> 11:13.780
that we'll always find the
way back to each other.

11:17.276 --> 11:20.223
Do you take each other
as spouses forever?

11:20.446 --> 11:21.618
I do.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.622
I do.

11:27.019 --> 11:31.297
Then by the power vested in me
by the State of Illinois, I...

11:31.791 --> 11:32.861
Security.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.037
I now pronounce you man and
wife and best friends for life.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.505
Kiss! Run!

12:35.087 --> 12:38.466
I have one piece.
One piece.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.565
It's...
It's not happening.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.706
I don't...

12:45.264 --> 12:46.709
Oh, my God.

12:47.366 --> 12:48.401
You're gonna be fine.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.276
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to call them.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.404
I'm gonna have to call them

12:51.470 --> 12:53.541
and tell them
that I can't do it.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.318
Come to bed with me.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.620
Come on. I know you wanna
come to bed with me.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.925
Don't!

13:05.985 --> 13:07.828
Oh, no, please, no.

13:13.425 --> 13:14.460
Stop it!

13:14.560 --> 13:15.732
Okay, okay, okay.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.641
I think this one's
coming along fine.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.577
I mean,
I know it's not finished,

13:23.636 --> 13:25.980
but I'm already starting
to see a mood.

13:26.505 --> 13:30.954
It's got like a darkening
curtain thing happening there,

13:31.010 --> 13:34.856
and then a competing
light element, there.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.017
Mmm-hmm.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.425
It's abstract, but,
I mean, I don't know,

13:38.484 --> 13:41.158
I kind ofthink
it's already powerful.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.361
What?

13:45.357 --> 13:47.200
You totally love me.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.935
Yeah, I do.
Yeah.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.209
I know because
this is my piece,

13:56.502 --> 13:58.846
and that's the scrap pile,

14:00.506 --> 14:02.508
which I'm now saving.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.849
Hmm.

14:42.047 --> 14:48.828
<i>A moment of total physical,
mental, and every other kind of love.</i>

14:56.695 --> 14:58.368
Don't crowd her.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.337
She's gonna be a little groggy,

15:00.399 --> 15:03.243
so let's just
give her some space.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.541
Hey.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.517
It's so good to see you.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.091
Paige?

15:21.720 --> 15:24.257
It's okay.
You're in the hospital.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.293
You were in a car accident.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.303
You hit your head,
but you're okay.

15:28.394 --> 15:31.136
We just kept you asleep
for a little while.

15:31.630 --> 15:32.870
How do you feel?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.704
My head hurts.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.580
Yeah, well,
that's perfectly normal.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.209
I'll get you
something for that.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.584
Was anyone else hurt, Doctor?

15:47.613 --> 15:48.956
Uh...

15:53.485 --> 15:55.931
Paige,
you know who I am, right?

15:55.988 --> 15:58.468
Yeah. You're my doctor.

16:05.731 --> 16:06.971
Um...

16:16.809 --> 16:18.516
I'm your husband.

16:22.915 --> 16:23.985
Paige?

16:42.768 --> 16:44.941
Mr. Collins? You said
things were very good.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.678
A brain injury isn't like a
broken bone or a laceration.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.150
Brains are
much less predictable.

16:49.308 --> 16:52.448
Sometimes, due to the way the swelling
tissue presses against the skull,

16:52.511 --> 16:53.683
it can cause some impairment.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.281
Some impairment?

16:55.347 --> 16:56.485
She doesn't remember me.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.323
Even though she's awake,
the swelling

16:58.384 --> 17:00.455
can cause confusion
or memory loss,

17:00.519 --> 17:01.827
erratic mood swings.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.159
What?
But that's normal.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.474
<i>So, that's my theory.</i>

17:15.034 --> 17:18.208
<i>That these moments of impact
define who we are.</i>

17:21.240 --> 17:23.584
<i>But what I never considered</i>

17:24.309 --> 17:28.382
<i>was what if, one day, you could
no longer remember any of them?</i>

17:43.262 --> 17:44.366
Hi.

17:45.497 --> 17:46.669
What are you up to?

17:46.732 --> 17:47.836
Sleeping.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.509
Right.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.281
I brought you some clothes.

17:54.339 --> 17:55.716
Thank you.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.353
I'm kind of hungry.

18:02.614 --> 18:03.786
Okay.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.060
Come on.

18:10.589 --> 18:15.095
So, I just wanted to verify
few things with you bout me,

18:15.360 --> 18:16.737
about us.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.235
Great.
So, we're married?

18:19.565 --> 18:20.771
Yes.
Yeah.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.812
And I have weird hair.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.612
I think that's
taking a narrow view.

18:25.871 --> 18:28.477
You said it takes
too long to straighten

18:28.574 --> 18:30.576
and you'd rather use that
time to work in your studio.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.418
My studio?
Why do I have a studio?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.283
You're an artist.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.957
Sculptor.
A really good one.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.895
Right now, you're
working on four pieces

18:42.955 --> 18:44.559
for the Tribune Tower lobby,

18:44.623 --> 18:46.000
which is huge.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.469
Everyone in town
wanted that commission.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.904
But your show at the MCA's
12 x 12 was amazing,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.465
so you won it.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.644
What about my law degree?

18:57.269 --> 18:59.180
I don't have a law degree?

18:59.671 --> 19:00.741
I think you were

19:00.806 --> 19:02.342
a few credits shy.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.921
Last time I wanted
to be an artist,

19:05.978 --> 19:08.288
I was in high school.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.694
<i>I think you need to
look at it like a win.</i>

19:13.785 --> 19:15.924
Traumatic brain injury is awin?
You're an idiot.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.767
If she doesn't
remember who you are,

19:18.824 --> 19:21.168
then she doesn't remember all
the stupid shit you ever did.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.762
You can start over,
wipe the slate clean.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.371
I'm just worried if
she doesn't remember you,

19:25.464 --> 19:27.876
how's she going to remember
she's in love with you? What?

19:27.966 --> 19:29.001
I was frankly a little stunned

19:29.101 --> 19:30.171
she went for you
the first time.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.976
If anything, you've
become less attractive.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.181
You guys are
a great support system.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.156
Seriously, though.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.622
What if she doesn't
remember me?

19:41.380 --> 19:42.518
Then what?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.521
She's gonna remember you.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.190
She's gonna remember all of us.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.563
We're her family.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.969
Yeah, you're right.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.490
Excuse me. I'm looking
for my wife, Paige Collins.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.758
She was right
over here yesterday.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.590
Well, it looks like they moved
her up to the VIP floor.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.762
That sounds expensive.
It's a donor's wing.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.667
Just go down here
and take the elevator

20:29.728 --> 20:31.765
to the second floor
and make a right.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.399
Okay. Thanks.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.615
Paige, your long-term
memory recall is intact

20:40.706 --> 20:45.086
and I'm very optimistic the rest of your
memory is going to improve with time.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.217
Mr. Collins,
I'm so glad you're here.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.697
This is bizarre.
I'm Leo, Paige's husband.

20:54.386 --> 20:58.300
Do you know how disconcerting
it was to hear second-hand

20:58.390 --> 21:01.098
that my daughter had been
in the ICU for weeks

21:01.293 --> 21:03.204
and we hadn't been told?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.040
You should have called us.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.474
I'm sorry.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.106
You've never met my parents?

21:10.202 --> 21:12.239
I don't understand.
Why haven't you met him?

21:12.304 --> 21:14.306
So, Doctor, now what
is the next step?

21:14.706 --> 21:16.743
The sooner she settles
back into her life,

21:16.875 --> 21:19.412
her normal routine, the better.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.048
Starting in a week or so,
I'm gonna recommend

21:21.113 --> 21:22.956
that Paige see
a neural psychologist.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.593
- Okay.
- Whatever she needs.

21:24.650 --> 21:25.924
Therapy, specialists,

21:25.984 --> 21:27.463
I'll make sure
she gets the best.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.327
You'll come home where I
can take care of you.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.157
Mom can make up your old room,

21:31.256 --> 21:33.429
and I can take
some time off work.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.401
I don't mean to
be disrespectful,

21:36.461 --> 21:37.997
'cause we really
appreciate that,

21:38.297 --> 21:40.277
but you just heard
Paige's doctor say

21:40.332 --> 21:42.903
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.073
Her life with me is
her normal routine.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.344
Yes, but that's a life
she doesn't remember.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.576
She will.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.914
That's what her doctor
just got through saying.

21:50.008 --> 21:52.955
No. What she said was that
maybe Paige will remember.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.184
Now, why not let her come home

21:55.280 --> 21:57.260
and recover with
people that she knows?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.420
And loves?

21:58.483 --> 22:00.258
We're only trying to
do the best for Paige.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.332
That's interesting, 'cause you
haven't even asked her once.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.332
Well, no, but... What I
really need is for everyone

22:04.423 --> 22:06.164
to just stop bickering!

22:07.492 --> 22:10.166
Listen, none of this
needs to be decided right now.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.332
No. Sorry.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.808
I think you should
all head home, get some rest.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.970
I'm sure everyone could use it.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.507
How is it that
you're my husband

22:17.602 --> 22:18.979
and you've never met my family?

22:19.805 --> 22:22.786
You haven't spoken
to them in years.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.023
Why would I ever stop
speaking to my family?

22:27.746 --> 22:29.419
It all went down before we met.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.490
And we never talked about it?

22:31.583 --> 22:32.789
No, we did.

22:34.753 --> 22:35.823
So?

22:36.988 --> 22:39.935
For starters, you wanted
to move into the city

22:39.991 --> 22:41.299
and go to the Art Institute.

22:42.294 --> 22:45.366
And your father insisted
that you stay in law school.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.937
He had some pretty strict views

22:46.998 --> 22:48.136
on what you ought to be doing.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.438
Things just
spiraled from there.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.844
Okay. Look, what I remember
is being in law school

22:55.941 --> 22:58.717
and being engaged to Jeremy.

23:02.013 --> 23:04.892
I... I don't know.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.163
Paige.

23:13.525 --> 23:16.165
Okay, babe, babe, just, just...

23:16.828 --> 23:20.002
The best thing to do
at this point

23:20.065 --> 23:23.410
is to go back
to your life with me.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.673
You heard what the doctor said.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.045
It's the best thing
for your recovery.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.312
Okay, but I don't know you.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.514
And I'm just supposed
to get in your car

23:31.576 --> 23:33.749
and go and live at your place?

23:33.979 --> 23:35.049
It's our place.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.218
Without any proof of us
even being in love?

23:37.315 --> 23:38.385
Other than our marriage?

23:38.483 --> 23:40.429
People get married for all
kinds of different reasons.

23:40.519 --> 23:41.896
Okay. Like?

23:41.987 --> 23:43.330
Like for a green card.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.092
I'm from Cincinnati.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.403
Did I keep a journal?

23:50.929 --> 23:52.738
No, not that I know of.

24:07.579 --> 24:10.116
I guess this is
all he could find.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.686
Oh, well.
It looks fine, honey.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.595
I mean, we're
just going home, so...

24:15.787 --> 24:17.391
It's horrible...
Paige?

24:18.223 --> 24:20.225
I understand you're
finally leaving us.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.863
Oh, yes, that's
what they tell me.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.468
So, no driving until
I give you the say-so.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.380
But other than that, I'm gonna
see you in four to six weeks.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.047
All right?
Thank you so much.

24:33.104 --> 24:35.141
- Thank you, Doctor, for everything.
- Thank you, Doctor.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.947
Okay.
You ready? Let's go.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.214
Wait, hold on.
I got a voicemail.

24:39.277 --> 24:40.756
It's from before the accident.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.554
You said you wanted evidence.

24:43.615 --> 24:46.755
Okay, yeah.
Well, let's have a listen.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.632
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

24:50.722 --> 24:53.168
<i>Ugh. I'm sorry,
I'm still at my studio.</i>

24:53.258 --> 24:56.967
<i>I miss you so bad my sculptures
are starting to look like you.</i>

24:57.462 --> 24:59.772
<i>So, what are you doing later?</i>

24:59.931 --> 25:03.504
<i>I kind of need some Leo time,
if you know what I mean.</i>

25:05.136 --> 25:08.015
<i>Yeah. Anyway, call me back.</i>

25:08.406 --> 25:10.249
Love you.

25:13.612 --> 25:17.492
I don't know, I guess
in listening back to it,

25:17.582 --> 25:18.993
it doesn't
exactly prove anything.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.788
No, no, it's...

25:21.453 --> 25:25.526
It's cute.
I mean, I sound happy.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.099
Okay, look.
Think about it.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.368
You quit law school,
you broke off your engagement

25:33.465 --> 25:34.808
and you moved into the city.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.040
Those were all
choices that you made,

25:37.135 --> 25:39.513
way before you even met me.

25:39.604 --> 25:41.811
I think that
you owe it to yourself

25:42.274 --> 25:45.551
to honor those decisions,
at least for right now.

25:48.446 --> 25:50.187
This is a mistake, Paige.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.792
I promise that
I will take care of her.

25:53.985 --> 25:57.057
Please, come home with me.
Come home with me.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.126
We'll figure this out together.

26:06.464 --> 26:08.410
I guess I could just try it out

26:09.968 --> 26:11.709
to see if it would
help my memory and...

26:11.803 --> 26:12.838
Mmm-hmm.

26:13.805 --> 26:16.877
I could always come home
if I change my mind.

26:18.209 --> 26:20.485
I married him. It must
have been for some reason.

26:21.479 --> 26:22.981
A guarded endorsement.

26:23.048 --> 26:24.493
But I will take it.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.669
I look like a freak.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.198
I think you look great.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.440
Where do we live?

26:47.539 --> 26:48.882
On the north side.

26:53.411 --> 26:55.254
Who's the president?

26:55.413 --> 26:57.359
Of the country?
Yeah.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.356
Obama.

27:00.385 --> 27:01.762
The senator?

27:03.288 --> 27:05.393
Yeah. You voted for him.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.898
I did?

27:19.971 --> 27:21.473
Welcome home.

27:24.442 --> 27:25.819
After you.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.321
Surprise!

27:36.955 --> 27:38.059
Uh...

27:39.057 --> 27:40.934
It's good to see you.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.435
We were there every day
at the hospital,

27:42.494 --> 27:44.167
but Leo didn't want us
to overwhelm you.

27:44.262 --> 27:45.935
Yeah. They were.
Every day.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.499
We really missed you.

27:48.099 --> 27:50.579
I gather we're close?

27:52.103 --> 27:55.778
I'm Sonia. And this
is my boyfriend Kyle.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.145
Hey, Paige.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.277
And this is Jim.

27:58.643 --> 28:00.122
You look great, Paige.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.623
And Lily.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.454
Hey. What, were you, like,
working out at the hospital?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.587
- Hey, Paige.
- And Josh.

28:06.951 --> 28:10.160
I... Sorry, I... Excuse me.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.831
Thank you all for coming.
I'm sorry it ended early.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.307
It's all right.
Take care, Leo.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.063
Are you okay?

28:51.696 --> 28:52.970
What do you think?

28:54.466 --> 28:56.810
I know. It's a lot to take in.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.673
No.

28:59.337 --> 29:02.978
A lot to take in
would've been coming home,

29:04.008 --> 29:07.512
to a strange apartment,
with a man I don't know.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.058
That would be a lot to take in.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.889
But coming home to all of that,

29:13.985 --> 29:15.862
plus a house full of people

29:15.920 --> 29:20.335
pulling on me, and hugging
me, and crying in my face,

29:20.391 --> 29:22.667
and talking about more shit
that I don't remember,

29:22.727 --> 29:25.833
that's not a lot to take in,
that's total bullshit.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.367
You're right.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.379
It was only supposed
to be a few people.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.778
Will you please just get out?

29:37.408 --> 29:40.218
Paige, I'm sorry.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.788
Are you honestly not
gonna leave me alone?

29:43.381 --> 29:45.292
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

29:46.184 --> 29:47.561
Of course.

29:52.757 --> 29:54.361
I'm sorry.

30:40.605 --> 30:41.913
Oh.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.954
Oh, my God. Oh, my
mother's gonna kill me.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.671
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.534
What?
You didn't knock!

31:10.368 --> 31:12.314
It's habit. I'm sorry.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.006
It's not like you haven't
seen it before. Come on.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.824
This is not funny.
You should knock.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.457
I'm sorry.

31:40.098 --> 31:41.168
You look nice.

31:41.332 --> 31:42.470
Really?

31:44.035 --> 31:47.539
This is about the only piece of my
clothing I feel comfortable in.

31:48.439 --> 31:49.850
That's mine, actually.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.014
Oh.

31:52.176 --> 31:53.712
No, it's fine.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.158
What?
Huh?

32:03.554 --> 32:06.034
You're looking at me like I'm
some kind of zoo animal.

32:08.059 --> 32:09.367
Sorry, I don't know.
I'm just trying

32:09.460 --> 32:10.871
to figure this out,
too, I guess.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.412
You normally do all this?

32:18.503 --> 32:20.847
This is my apology
for last night.

32:21.172 --> 32:24.016
That was such a bonehead move.
I just wasn't thinking.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.348
No, please.
I'm sorry. I...

32:28.212 --> 32:30.055
I don't want you to
worry about me, okay?

32:30.148 --> 32:33.027
Just go about your
normal routine and...

32:34.986 --> 32:36.932
Do you work?
Do you have a job?

32:38.723 --> 32:41.226
Yeah. Well, that's
if I'm still in business.

32:43.094 --> 32:45.199
I own a recording studio.

32:46.197 --> 32:47.505
Hmm. Cool.

32:52.203 --> 32:55.844
So, what is my routine?
What do I do all day?

32:56.541 --> 32:57.781
Well...

32:59.544 --> 33:02.024
You usually get up
and make coffee.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.082
All right. No, no, no. I got
it, I got it, I got it.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.593
I did it this morning, I think.

33:08.419 --> 33:11.798
And then you... Oh, no, don't.
That one's for me.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.061
You don't eat meat.

33:14.859 --> 33:16.099
Oh.

33:18.796 --> 33:22.141
Then you check e-mails
and pay bills.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.138
Okay.

33:24.235 --> 33:27.444
Which I'm betting that you don't
remember any of the passwords

33:27.572 --> 33:29.609
or account numbers, huh?
Mmm-mmm.

33:29.707 --> 33:30.777
So, I guess I'll do that.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.115
Okay.

33:32.977 --> 33:35.617
And then you go down
to your studio.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.750
I could take you down there,
show you what you're working on.

33:38.816 --> 33:41.456
You know what? We don't have to
rehash everything right now.

33:41.552 --> 33:42.929
I mean, just...

33:42.987 --> 33:46.230
You go to work, and we can make

33:46.290 --> 33:48.167
flashcards later, or something.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.165
Are you sure?

33:51.262 --> 33:52.741
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.605
Okay. Well, your, look...

33:58.169 --> 34:00.274
You got keys, phone here.

34:01.172 --> 34:04.176
If you need me, all my
numbers are on there.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.978
Okay.
Okay.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.355
All right.
Yup.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.290
Have a good day.

34:36.841 --> 34:38.786
What's up, Lil?
Hey.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.116
Fill me in.

34:40.178 --> 34:42.454
That guy, Pointy Shoes?
He's a really bad kisser.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.455
I don't think I'm gonna
keep him in rotation.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.859
Okay.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.366
Honestly, though,
it's actually been hell.

34:50.455 --> 34:52.628
Yesterday, we were
somehow double-booked.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.130
Too many clients,
that's a high-class problem.

34:55.293 --> 34:56.829
Yeah, but with only one studio,

34:56.893 --> 34:59.135
it's pretty impossible
to take on both gigs.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.541
Right? So, Dune Advertising
weren't flexible

35:01.632 --> 35:02.702
and they rebooked
over at Soundspace.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.145
Wait? What? Come on.
That's a big account.

35:07.572 --> 35:09.051
They should always
be prioritized.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.312
You know that.

35:10.374 --> 35:11.478
Yeah. Look...

35:13.211 --> 35:16.658
I can't run the sessions and
handle account services, right?

35:16.714 --> 35:18.352
This isn't
a one-woman operation.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.326
It's not like
I flaked or something.

35:20.384 --> 35:22.523
I know, I get it.
I'm not mad.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.999
I'm just... I'm just
saying shit's slipping.

35:25.756 --> 35:27.565
Well, I'm here now.

35:31.696 --> 35:33.073
How's she doing?

35:33.164 --> 35:34.438
She's getting there.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.441
She's...

35:37.668 --> 35:39.170
Look, thanks.

35:40.037 --> 35:41.380
It'll be fine.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.583
Okay. Good.

35:47.178 --> 35:49.590
So, you'll be
at the 3:30 pitch?

35:49.847 --> 35:51.087
Of course.

35:51.215 --> 35:54.628
I'm going to head home, then
change, and check on Paige,

35:54.719 --> 35:56.892
but I'll be there.
Okay.

36:10.368 --> 36:12.609
<i>I vow to help you love life,</i>

36:14.372 --> 36:17.046
<i>to always hold you
with tenderness,</i>

36:17.108 --> 36:19.987
<i>and to have the patience
that love demands.</i>

36:20.077 --> 36:22.284
<i>To speak when words are needed</i>

36:22.380 --> 36:25.224
<i>and to share the silence
when they're not.</i>

36:25.283 --> 36:28.560
<i>To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.</i>

36:30.121 --> 36:32.101
<i>And to live within
the warmth of your heart</i>

36:32.156 --> 36:33.760
<i>and always call it home.</i>

36:34.325 --> 36:36.236
<i>Did you write
your vows on a menu?</i>

36:39.230 --> 36:40.402
Weird.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.501
<i>I vow to fiercely Jove you</i>

36:42.600 --> 36:45.809
<i>in all your forms,
now and forever.</i>

36:46.637 --> 36:50.517
I <i>promise to never forget that
this is</i> a <i>once-in-a-lifetime Jove.</i>

36:51.742 --> 36:55.121
<i>And to always know in the
deepest part of my soul,</i>

36:55.479 --> 36:57.823
<i>no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,</i>

36:58.282 --> 37:01.627
<i>that we'll always find the
way back to each other.</i>

37:15.833 --> 37:17.369
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.606
Could I have a...

37:22.473 --> 37:23.884
One of these?

37:23.975 --> 37:25.386
You don't want the usual?

37:26.344 --> 37:27.982
I have a usual?

37:28.546 --> 37:30.958
That would be perfect.
I'll have the usual.

37:32.683 --> 37:33.821
All right.

37:33.884 --> 37:34.954
Here you go.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.795
Thank you.

37:40.224 --> 37:41.703
Thanks.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.184
Paige?

38:24.201 --> 38:25.805
Can I help you?

38:27.705 --> 38:28.877
Could I borrow your phone?

38:30.508 --> 38:31.748
Hello?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.483
Hey, Lil.
No, I know it's 3:30.

38:34.545 --> 38:37.549
Look, I can't. I can't.
I gotta find Paige.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.821
No, no. I don't know.
Make it up.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.896
I'm sorry. I didn't
know who else to call.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.435
Get in, sweetheart.
Get in.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.004
Oh, sweetie.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.834
Yeah You all right?

39:04.241 --> 39:05.845
Hey.
Hey.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.752
Where you been? I was starting
to get a little worried.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.451
Thought something
might've happened to you.

39:11.549 --> 39:14.120
Sorry.
I was lost, physically.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.063
Mentally, I guess, as well.

39:17.121 --> 39:18.862
Well, you should've called me.

39:18.923 --> 39:20.800
Yeah, I forgot the phone

39:20.891 --> 39:22.598
and I don't know
your number by heart,

39:22.693 --> 39:24.138
so I called my mom

39:24.228 --> 39:26.902
and we made a day of it,
which was great.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.235
She invited us
for dinner tonight.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.477
Dinner? Okay.

39:36.307 --> 39:37.650
You don't have to go.

39:37.742 --> 39:40.416
Well, you're not allowed to
drive, so I do have to go.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.389
But that's not the point.

39:46.083 --> 39:48.495
You know, maybe I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow

39:48.586 --> 39:50.293
and remember everything,

39:50.388 --> 39:53.335
but right now they're the
only thing I'm sure about.

39:57.661 --> 39:58.833
Okay.

39:59.663 --> 40:01.006
We'll go.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.072
Okay.

40:05.669 --> 40:06.807
Okay.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.144
Are you gonna change?

40:09.407 --> 40:10.852
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

40:11.475 --> 40:12.818
Changing.

40:15.279 --> 40:17.520
It's just a left up here
at the Caldwells',

40:17.615 --> 40:18.958
and then a right
at the cul-de-sac,

40:19.016 --> 40:20.996
and we're six houses
in on the right.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.157
Oh, the Prestleys got
a new mailbox. So cute.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.436
You know, this arrangement
doesn't exactly say,

40:28.492 --> 40:30.130
"I'm sorry that
we haven't spoken,"

40:30.194 --> 40:31.366
"but now that
I have a brain injury,"

40:31.462 --> 40:33.203
"maybe you can
overlook it."

40:33.497 --> 40:34.976
You're right.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.706
We should've got them
forget-me-nots.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.972
That's funny.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.843
Actually, that is funny.

40:44.675 --> 40:47.121
So, well, you've
already met my parents,

40:47.178 --> 40:50.990
but my dad will say to call him
Bill, but he prefers Mr. Thornton.

40:51.048 --> 40:52.152
And my sister's name is...

40:52.216 --> 40:53.559
Gwen.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.725
I know a lot about
your family, Paige.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.232
Right. Yeah.

40:58.322 --> 41:00.700
We're married.
You know?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.567
Oh, my God, you're engaged!
I know.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.639
Wow.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.140
You guys make a really cute couple.
Oh, thanks, Paige.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.178
Wow.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.713
It has been forever.

41:17.808 --> 41:18.980
Has it?

41:19.043 --> 41:20.113
Yeah.

41:20.711 --> 41:23.555
The weird thing is that everyone
looks a little bit older.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.649
Really? Yeah. You,
especially.

41:25.716 --> 41:28.390
Oh, I'm... I'm so happy
to have you back.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.863
<i>Voilà.</i>

41:30.020 --> 41:33.866
In honor of Paige being home,
I made your favorite dinner.

41:34.291 --> 41:35.895
Filet mignon.

41:37.528 --> 41:39.371
Oh, please. Please. Sit down.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.710
Before we start, I think this
evening deserves a toast.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.010
Darling?

41:48.072 --> 41:51.019
Well, I... I would like
to drink to my family.

41:52.243 --> 41:57.488
I am so fortunate to have these
three beautiful women in my life

41:57.548 --> 42:01.553
and, when we're all together,
that fortune just multiplies.

42:01.886 --> 42:03.559
Paige, honey, welcome home.

42:04.889 --> 42:06.266
To family.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.064
To family.

42:09.994 --> 42:12.736
So, Leo,
what about your family?

42:13.731 --> 42:15.176
Do you see them often?

42:15.232 --> 42:16.370
No.

42:16.433 --> 42:17.537
Oh, that's a shame.

42:18.335 --> 42:20.042
Both my parents are dead.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.340
It's just Paige.

42:23.607 --> 42:25.211
She's my family now.

42:28.679 --> 42:31.717
And what kind of
work do you do, Leo?

42:31.782 --> 42:34.854
I just opened up my own
recording studio downtown.

42:34.919 --> 42:38.696
Paige actually convinced me
to turn it into a business.

42:40.524 --> 42:41.628
I did?

42:41.759 --> 42:42.897
Yeah.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.876
Isn't that sort
of a dying field?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.577
No, I just mean,
can't people record things

42:51.635 --> 42:52.773
on their computers at home

42:52.870 --> 42:54.941
and they sound just as good?
Ryan.

42:55.039 --> 42:56.279
What?

42:56.373 --> 42:57.875
Look, the records that I like,

42:57.942 --> 43:01.321
they have life
and warmth and soul.

43:02.079 --> 43:05.583
Like the slapback on Scotty
Moore's guitar on <i>Mystery Train.</i>

43:06.150 --> 43:08.596
Look, you're not gonna get
that in your computer.

43:08.652 --> 43:11.064
You're gonna want a live room,
you're gonna want to bounce to tape.

43:11.121 --> 43:15.228
You're gonna want real musicians in
a room, vibing off of each other.

43:15.292 --> 43:16.600
You...

43:16.660 --> 43:19.834
I guess, to answer your question,
it may be a dying field

43:19.930 --> 43:24.310
and you can record
high-quality stuff at home.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.274
But, I mean, come on,

43:27.338 --> 43:30.285
you can't get the Sun
Sessions on your laptop.

43:33.811 --> 43:35.085
Wow.

43:36.680 --> 43:37.818
Wow.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.693
Wow.
Wow.

43:45.689 --> 43:47.532
I heard everyone is
gonna be here tonight.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.662
This kind of thing might be a
little too much for Paige.

43:49.760 --> 43:52.138
Oh, no,
I'm good here, actually.

43:54.798 --> 43:56.778
Isn't that Diane Chain?

43:58.202 --> 44:01.149
Yeah, we don't really
hang out any more.

44:01.205 --> 44:03.981
God, you have been
away a long time.

44:04.041 --> 44:05.145
Oh, my God!

44:07.978 --> 44:09.548
Good luck, man.

44:10.147 --> 44:11.888
Hi.
Hi!

44:13.283 --> 44:15.854
Sorry. Leo, these are my
friends from high school.

44:15.953 --> 44:17.990
This is Shana, Carrie, Lizbet.

44:18.055 --> 44:19.295
Hi.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.471
What about me? I don't
get an introduction?

44:25.629 --> 44:26.699
Hi.

44:26.797 --> 44:27.832
Hi.

44:31.568 --> 44:32.911
Sorry, this is...

44:33.637 --> 44:34.911
Jeremy.

44:35.339 --> 44:36.682
It's been a long time.

44:37.574 --> 44:39.019
Has it?

44:39.877 --> 44:43.324
It doesn't seem like it.
You haven't changed a bit.

44:43.380 --> 44:45.986
I'm not sure if she
mentioned it. I'm Leo.

44:46.050 --> 44:48.223
Hi.
Paige's husband.

44:48.318 --> 44:50.889
Right.
I'm gonna grab a drink.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.160
You guys want anything?

44:52.222 --> 44:53.360
Disaronno sour?

44:53.424 --> 44:54.732
I'll have a blueberry mojito.

44:54.825 --> 44:55.997
Really?

44:56.060 --> 44:57.835
Yes, I remember.

45:01.999 --> 45:03.239
Oh, my God, Paige.

45:03.333 --> 45:04.539
Do you remember when we
were in the ninth grade,

45:04.601 --> 45:06.012
and we were getting ready
for the Christmas dance,

45:06.070 --> 45:07.879
we were curling your hair...

45:07.938 --> 45:09.918
We ended up
burning off half your hair.

45:10.007 --> 45:12.044
I totally remember that!

45:12.443 --> 45:15.014
And didn't I wind up having
to wear a beret to the dance?

45:15.079 --> 45:16.490
No, no, no, that was the...

45:22.052 --> 45:24.498
It was like she was
some sweater-set wearing,

45:24.555 --> 45:26.899
mojito-drinking
sorority girl.

45:26.990 --> 45:29.027
Like a Stepford wife?

45:29.359 --> 45:30.565
Yeah, basically.

45:30.661 --> 45:32.868
She was even flirting with
Jeremy right in front of me.

45:32.930 --> 45:34.273
Ex-fiancé Jeremy?

45:34.364 --> 45:35.604
No, no. No.

45:35.699 --> 45:38.578
In her mind,
it's current fiancé Jeremy.

45:39.369 --> 45:41.610
Which is why it was
probably pretty annoying

45:41.705 --> 45:45.278
to have her stranger husband
cock-block her all night.

45:46.343 --> 45:48.949
That is a lot to
get my mind around.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.551
So, what turns her on?

45:52.850 --> 45:54.056
Paige?

45:54.118 --> 45:55.290
No, her mother.

45:55.385 --> 45:56.887
Yes, Paige.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.124
Like, in bed?

45:59.223 --> 46:00.634
Oh, my God, Leo.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.260
What?
It's private. It's...

46:02.359 --> 46:03.929
I don't know.

46:04.027 --> 46:05.768
It's... It's kind of a
between-me-and-her kind of thing.

46:05.896 --> 46:07.967
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

46:09.867 --> 46:11.574
She likes being tickled.

46:12.536 --> 46:13.947
Seriously?

46:14.037 --> 46:16.210
Wow. Thought you
weren't gonna judge.

46:16.273 --> 46:17.980
I'm not. I'm just... I...

46:18.075 --> 46:19.281
I don't care if
you're into kink.

46:19.376 --> 46:21.219
It's not like that.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.724
It just breaks her down
when she's stuck in her head.

46:23.814 --> 46:26.260
Okay.
You should give that a shot.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.154
Seriously?

46:28.252 --> 46:29.458
Yeah. What do
you have to lose?

46:46.670 --> 46:48.343
Hey, Lisa.
Hey.

46:48.605 --> 46:49.743
Paige?

46:49.807 --> 46:53.482
Because I've been dealing with these
people forever and I know they have...

46:56.513 --> 46:59.460
Something important
just popped up.

46:59.516 --> 47:01.621
I'm gonna call you
right back. Okay.

47:05.289 --> 47:06.597
Hi.
Hi.

47:07.457 --> 47:08.765
Please.

47:16.366 --> 47:20.109
So, you remember
that time at the lake,

47:20.938 --> 47:24.147
when you told me you'd always
have my back, no matter what?

47:24.208 --> 47:25.312
The night in the boathouse.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.820
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

47:27.010 --> 47:28.284
Yeah.

47:28.812 --> 47:32.157
So, can you please tell me
what went down with us?

47:32.649 --> 47:34.959
Only you, Paige,
can dump a guy,

47:35.018 --> 47:37.055
then come back
and demand answers.

47:39.656 --> 47:41.158
So I dumped you?

47:41.225 --> 47:45.139
A cruel, hard,
pre-wedding dumping.

47:46.964 --> 47:48.238
Why?

47:49.233 --> 47:51.839
Well, that's a question
that I and all of my friends

47:51.902 --> 47:53.882
and the two rebound girls,

47:53.971 --> 47:55.848
yeah, we'd all
love an answer to.

47:55.973 --> 47:57.316
Come on, seriously.

47:57.374 --> 47:59.183
I must have had
some kind of reason.

47:59.243 --> 48:00.586
You...

48:01.578 --> 48:03.080
You... You changed.

48:04.147 --> 48:08.061
You talked differently,
you dressed differently.

48:08.752 --> 48:10.732
You weren't sure
about law school any more.

48:12.522 --> 48:15.366
And you definitely weren't
sure about me any more.

48:17.327 --> 48:18.601
Did I give you your ring back?

48:18.695 --> 48:20.197
Yeah, you did.

48:22.032 --> 48:23.773
Who has that now?

48:23.867 --> 48:25.403
No one yet.

48:26.837 --> 48:28.510
But I've been with Rose.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.279
You remember?
From Gwen's class.

48:30.374 --> 48:33.287
I've been with Rose
for about a year now.

48:35.879 --> 48:38.189
I couldn't wait forever, Paige.

48:38.248 --> 48:40.728
You couldn't have anticipated

48:40.784 --> 48:45.096
that I'd have a brain trauma
and forget our break-up

48:45.188 --> 48:46.861
and come waltzing
into your office

48:46.924 --> 48:48.562
demanding answers?

48:48.625 --> 48:49.797
What's wrong with you?

48:53.063 --> 48:55.134
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
let you go back to work.

48:55.232 --> 48:56.643
Sure.

49:11.448 --> 49:12.927
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

49:13.050 --> 49:14.791
I was not expecting that.

49:14.885 --> 49:16.762
Habit, I guess.

49:19.556 --> 49:24.562
I honestly didn't even know where I
was headed until I found myself here.

49:25.462 --> 49:27.339
It just seems
so ridiculous to me

49:27.431 --> 49:31.004
that I shut everyone out
for five years.

49:34.972 --> 49:37.248
It just doesn't feel right.

49:51.621 --> 49:52.691
Hey.

49:53.790 --> 49:55.827
Hey.
How was your day?

49:55.926 --> 49:58.133
Uh...

49:58.195 --> 49:59.674
It was fine.

50:01.932 --> 50:04.503
I'm just happy to
be home with you.

50:06.436 --> 50:08.973
Sorry about the mess here.

50:09.039 --> 50:10.518
No problem.

50:10.941 --> 50:12.614
What, are you collaging?

50:12.676 --> 50:13.950
Do I collage?

50:15.278 --> 50:17.349
No, not that I remember.

50:18.982 --> 50:21.622
No, you know,
I was just so inspired

50:21.685 --> 50:23.824
just seeing
everybody last night.

50:23.987 --> 50:25.364
To collage?

50:25.455 --> 50:27.560
All those memories just
came flooding back to me,

50:27.657 --> 50:31.366
so I thought I'd make a
timeline, you know, of my life.

50:31.795 --> 50:35.038
That's... That's great.
That's a great idea.

50:35.899 --> 50:37.173
Yeah.

50:37.234 --> 50:40.545
I kind of rummaged through some of your stuff.
I hope you don't mind.

50:42.005 --> 50:44.645
It's fine. It's fine.
What's mine is yours.

50:44.708 --> 50:47.211
I even have a certificate from the
State of Illinois to prove it.

50:47.310 --> 50:49.688
Yes, I found that.
It's in the lost years.

50:50.914 --> 50:52.587
See, I started over here.

50:52.682 --> 50:56.061
I found some family photos, me when
I was little, stuff like that.

50:56.219 --> 50:57.926
That was easy to put
into chronological order

50:58.021 --> 50:59.261
because I remember that stuff.

50:59.356 --> 51:00.562
That's good, right?

51:00.657 --> 51:02.398
Yeah, yeah. I guess so.

51:02.492 --> 51:04.267
But what I've been trying to do

51:04.361 --> 51:06.500
is pinpoint
the last memory I had

51:06.563 --> 51:09.043
before everything
just went blank.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.573
How's that going?

51:11.868 --> 51:14.212
I think I was
at the Macaroni Grill,

51:14.271 --> 51:17.844
and I was asking them if they had
those special toasted ravioli.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.286
And I don't
remember the answer.

51:20.377 --> 51:22.755
That's it, that's all,
that's my last memory

51:22.846 --> 51:25.190
before I woke up in a hospital.

51:25.282 --> 51:29.731
Oh, no. How are we ever gonna
know if they had toasted ravioli?

51:35.559 --> 51:37.698
God, this is not happening.

51:37.761 --> 51:39.069
It's okay.

51:39.129 --> 51:40.369
This is not happening.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.434
Okay? No, no, no, no,
please don't do that.

51:46.937 --> 51:48.974
What Come on.

51:49.372 --> 51:51.283
What are you doing?

51:51.942 --> 51:53.580
I'm sorry.

51:54.544 --> 51:58.287
I'm sorry. Was that...
That was one of our things?

51:58.582 --> 52:00.619
Yeah, kind of. It...
I'm sorry...

52:00.750 --> 52:01.785
No. You don't have
to say it.

52:01.885 --> 52:04.092
You don't. I get it.
It'll all come back.

52:04.154 --> 52:06.430
We just have to keep
doing what we're doing

52:06.490 --> 52:08.163
let you fall back
into your life.

52:08.258 --> 52:10.260
It'll all sort itself out.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.631
Yeah.

52:19.703 --> 52:19.802
<i>About a dozen
downtown businesses were boarded up...</i>

52:19.803 --> 52:23.216
<i>About a dozen
downtown businesses were boarded up...</i>

52:23.306 --> 52:26.310
<i>Glass littered sidewalks,
following two nights of pro tests</i>

52:26.376 --> 52:27.514
<i>over the police shooting of an.</i>

52:27.611 --> 52:28.681
Hey.

52:28.778 --> 52:30.451
<i>There were few people
on the street.</i>

52:30.547 --> 52:32.527
I think I'm ready
to see my studio now.

52:32.616 --> 52:33.959
Will you show it to me?

52:34.017 --> 52:35.325
Yeah.

52:35.385 --> 52:36.796
Come on.

52:55.972 --> 52:59.476
This is the first studio
you've ever had to yourself.

53:01.077 --> 53:03.250
It's a cool space, huh?
Wow.

53:08.718 --> 53:11.699
You weren't sure you liked
it at first, though.

53:11.755 --> 53:14.895
Until you had this idea
to burn some smudge stick

53:14.991 --> 53:18.404
that you bought from some guy
on the corner of Diversey.

53:19.095 --> 53:20.699
We lit this thing

53:20.764 --> 53:21.868
and we started waving it around

53:21.932 --> 53:25.880
until we realized that it was
just some old pieces of lettuce.

53:26.770 --> 53:30.377
So, we're waving around burning lettuce.
I don't know.

53:31.908 --> 53:33.683
But it must've done
the trick, though,

53:33.743 --> 53:37.088
'cause after that, I couldn't
get you out of here.

53:39.849 --> 53:41.726
You would come in
and crank your music,

53:41.785 --> 53:43.594
and you'd get lost
in a project,

53:43.687 --> 53:46.793
and I'd have to come and remind
you that it was night-time.

53:50.193 --> 53:53.538
This is one of your pieces
for the Tribune Tower series.

53:53.597 --> 53:55.736
What is it supposed to be?

53:56.566 --> 53:59.103
I'm not sure if
you even knew yet.

54:01.805 --> 54:03.409
But come here.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.318
I...

54:05.942 --> 54:10.755
Here, just help it figure
out what it wants to be.

54:15.885 --> 54:17.262
Okay.

54:17.787 --> 54:18.891
I don't...
I don't really know

54:18.955 --> 54:20.400
how to use this thing.

54:20.457 --> 54:23.301
Sure you do.
Wait, hold on.

54:30.467 --> 54:32.606
That's better. Come on.

54:32.669 --> 54:34.444
Just try it.
It might be fun.

54:34.504 --> 54:36.950
Can you just turn down
the music, please?

54:37.007 --> 54:38.680
I swear you used
to listen to it

54:38.775 --> 54:40.015
so much louder than this.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.248
I never could understand
how you would just

54:41.311 --> 54:42.415
be able to focus...

54:42.479 --> 54:44.584
I have a clinically bad,
goddamn headache!

54:44.648 --> 54:47.094
Please turn down the music!

54:55.425 --> 54:56.995
I'm trying to help you!

55:00.864 --> 55:02.866
But I am not your punching bag.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.642
We don't speak to
each other like this.

55:11.975 --> 55:14.387
This is hard for me,
too, Paige.

55:58.888 --> 56:00.333
Paige?

56:00.390 --> 56:01.869
Yeah?

56:03.727 --> 56:04.899
Hey.
Hey.

56:04.994 --> 56:06.871
I passed by that
little Portuguese bakery

56:06.930 --> 56:08.568
that you love on the way home,

56:08.665 --> 56:10.508
and I got us some...

56:14.270 --> 56:16.375
Is somebody here?
Yeah.

56:20.810 --> 56:22.756
Leo.
Hey.

56:23.947 --> 56:27.121
My sister's just up to her
eyeballs with this wedding stuff,

56:27.217 --> 56:29.060
and we've got the
engagement party coming up.

56:29.119 --> 56:32.566
And we all thought Paige could
come home and help her out.

56:32.622 --> 56:35.102
It just seems like
the right thing to do,

56:35.158 --> 56:36.728
to be there for Gwen.

56:39.262 --> 56:42.243
Okay. But what
about your life here?

56:43.933 --> 56:47.073
What about all the work
that you haven't finished?

56:47.137 --> 56:49.174
I talked to the people
at the Tribune.

56:49.272 --> 56:51.513
And they were really understanding
about the accident,

56:51.608 --> 56:53.349
and Dad's gonna
loan me the money

56:53.443 --> 56:55.616
to pay back
their advance, so...

56:55.678 --> 56:58.158
I don't know.
I just... I can't do it.

56:59.249 --> 57:00.751
You just come out
when you're ready, honey.

57:00.817 --> 57:02.592
Okay, thanks, Dad.

57:08.291 --> 57:10.464
I'm sorry. It's just
until after the wedding.

57:10.627 --> 57:13.267
I just want you to
be careful, okay?

57:13.763 --> 57:15.606
Well, I'm not joining a cult.

57:15.665 --> 57:17.508
I'm just going to
stay with my family.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.546
I know, but...
But what?

57:25.141 --> 57:28.122
Can I at least give you
an awkward hug?

57:46.830 --> 57:48.207
So, how are you feeling?

57:48.298 --> 57:49.641
Mmm. I feel fine.

57:49.699 --> 57:52.873
Yeah? No dizziness,
disorientation, sleepiness?

57:52.969 --> 57:54.812
Nope.
Great.

57:54.871 --> 57:57.579
Well, I'm very happy, and
your CT scan looks excellent.

57:57.674 --> 57:58.744
Oh.

57:58.842 --> 58:00.583
What a relief. Well...

58:00.677 --> 58:03.556
So, your memory recall,
anything?

58:03.646 --> 58:04.920
Not really.

58:05.014 --> 58:06.254
No, huh?

58:06.349 --> 58:08.226
That's not normal, is it?

58:08.318 --> 58:10.423
Listen, when it comes to the
brain, nothing is normal,

58:10.520 --> 58:12.659
because no two brain
injuries are the same.

58:12.722 --> 58:15.601
Paige seems
perfectly herself again.

58:15.692 --> 58:17.262
It's wonderful.

58:17.694 --> 58:20.106
Mrs. Thornton, could I just talk to
Paige alone for a moment, please?

58:21.998 --> 58:24.774
It's okay, Mom.
I'm... I'm good.

58:27.670 --> 58:29.047
All right.

58:30.707 --> 58:31.947
Thanks.

58:39.249 --> 58:42.230
Paige, do you want
to regain your memory?

58:42.285 --> 58:43.423
Yes.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.726
Because some patients fear

58:44.787 --> 58:46.061
that when their memory
comes back,

58:46.122 --> 58:47.533
so will the memory
of the trauma,

58:47.590 --> 58:48.933
but mercifully
that's rarely the case.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.198
Oh, no, that's not it.
I'm... I'm...

58:51.294 --> 58:53.240
I'm not afraid of the accident.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.532
So, what are you afraid of?

58:59.369 --> 59:02.714
I guess I just...
I don't know. It's...

59:04.140 --> 59:06.882
I mean, what if I don't
like the life that I had?

59:06.943 --> 59:08.547
Or what if I like it too much?

59:08.611 --> 59:09.919
I...

59:09.979 --> 59:11.890
I just don't know.

59:12.315 --> 59:14.124
I only did one psych rotation,

59:14.217 --> 59:16.322
so this may be terrible advice.

59:17.220 --> 59:20.394
But I think you have to
try and fill the holes.

59:21.257 --> 59:23.635
You can still decide
you want a different life,

59:23.726 --> 59:25.728
but if you don't at least

59:25.795 --> 59:27.240
open yourself up
to remembering,

59:27.297 --> 59:30.904
I'm afraid you're gonna live
in fear of your own past.

59:33.670 --> 59:35.445
Hey. I'm here.

59:37.807 --> 59:39.286
These guys are?

59:39.342 --> 59:42.118
Knife Skillz, with a Z.

59:42.178 --> 59:43.452
Right.

59:44.347 --> 59:47.692
Okay, Mikey, sounds amazing.
Let's just go for it.

59:48.851 --> 59:50.330
<i>I am going for it.</i>

59:50.420 --> 59:51.865
The bass line is one note.

59:51.988 --> 59:53.126
Just one note.

59:53.189 --> 59:54.293
Okay, cool.

59:54.791 --> 59:56.168
Take two.

59:59.662 --> 01:00:00.936
Wow.

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:02.772
You look different.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.870
Yeah. Going for
a Kanye kind of thing.

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.607
I'm gonna say
more Michael Bublé,

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.206
but, whatever, it's still good.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:10.442
Hmm.

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:15.684
So... I'm gonna be
in and out for awhile.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.860
Sounds really good, Mikey.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:24.727
Let's just take it from the top
or the middle or wherever.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.736
You know what? People come
here to work with you, okay?

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.739
I mean, I'm doing my best,
but you gotta be here.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.172
I know.

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:37.636
But if Paige is in Lake
Forest with her family,

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.370
that's where I gotta be.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.211
I gotta make my wife
fall in love with me again.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.654
- Oh, you found each other.
- Hi!

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.561
Let's see it.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:00.430
It's good to see you.
All right, take it easy.

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.400
The countdown's on, man.
Hey, man.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.198
One week left of
your former life.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.432
How you feeling?

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:07.371
I feel pretty good, actually.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.205
I mean, I do get a little dizzy

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:10.608
if I think about it
for too long, but...

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.770
What?

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:16.039
No, honey, it's like
a good dizzy. It's like...

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:19.245
It's like panic or excitement.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.225
Well, panic and excitement
are different.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.850
Honey, there's gonna
be 400 people there.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.121
Right.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.688
Hey, do you also have a little
tingling in your fingers?

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:33.393
Yeah. Is that bad?

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:34.727
Do you listen
to Radio-head?

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:35.895
Uh-huh.

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:39.565
Thom Yorke, he talks about
dizzy spells all the time.

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:42.104
He says when
his fingers tingle,

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:45.669
that's how he knows that he's
creating something genius.

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.304
And then he gets
so amped up playing

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.349
that he almost passes out.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:53.012
Ryan, it sounds to me like
you're on the verge of genius.

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:55.248
That's cool, man.
Cheers.

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.689
Ooh, Ryan, I have someone
I want you to meet.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.088
Mom, you listen
to Radio-head?

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.684
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.820
So, is that true?

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:04.591
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:12.497
Paige?

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.174
Hey, Leo.

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.781
What?
Your hair.

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:22.316
It looks so different.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.478
You look beautiful.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.678
Thank you.

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.653
Okay, look, so I've been
thinking about something.

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.121
Okay.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.453
What's your favorite book?

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:34.625
It's probably not
what you remember.

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.628
That's fine.
That's not the point.

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:39.166
Okay. The <i>Beach</i> House
by James Patterson.

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:41.327
No, really?
Yeah.

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:44.028
Okay. The <i>Beach</i> House.

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:47.965
Okay, if it was great, you probably
loaned it to somebody, right?

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.067
Yeah. Gwen, I think.

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:52.839
Okay, and you probably
said to yourself,

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:55.348
"God, I wish I was the
person that hadn't read it,"

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.850
"so that I could experience
it all over again."

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.853
Yeah, I guess so.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.855
That's how I think
we should look at this.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.253
What?

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.358
You can't remember how we met.

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.521
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.895
And you can't remember
how we fell in love.

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:14.662
And in a way, yeah, that sucks.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:18.900
But it was
the greatest time of my life.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:21.503
I just thought
how cool it would be

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.441
to get to experience it
all over again.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.044
Like reading your favorite
book for the first time.

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.912
Exactly.
Got you.

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.579
Which is why I want to
ask you out on a date.

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:35.453
A date?

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:37.786
Like two people that are just
meeting for the first time.

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:40.025
Jeremy...

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.854
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:45.866
Well, I don't know.
I mean, you know,

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.629
we've got
the wedding coming up.

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.396
But if we go out before then,

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.802
you might still be able
to take me as your date.

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:53.396
I can't promise anything,

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.806
but I'll put in
a good word for you.

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:59.112
All right.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.884
So, I have an idea, but it
involves going into the city.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.554
You okay with that?

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.722
Yeah, that's fine.

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:19.289
I just have to be back
by 10:00 in the morning.

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:20.492
Oh, my God.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:21.625
What?

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:22.929
First date and you're already

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.596
inviting yourself
to stay the night?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.799
I'm just a little
scandalized is all.

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.000
No, I just meant...

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.407
Don't worry.
I'll have you back tonight.

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:32.412
If you wanna
stay the night, that's...

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.914
I mean, it's...
If you want...

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:38.118
You wanna just see
how it goes? All right.

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:58.168
Should we get out?

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:00.138
We don't have to.

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:02.102
Is this the part of the date
where I find out

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.643
you're not actually my husband

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:05.201
but some crazy stalker,

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.372
and you're gonna strangle me
with my purse?

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:10.508
No. This is
the exact parking spot

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:12.108
where we first met.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.385
Oh.

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:17.955
I'm gonna take you on
a little retrospective of us.

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:26.662
Mmm.

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.331
That is so good.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.794
You ready for dessert?

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.465
Dessert?
Hmm.

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.340
We just had waffles.

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.071
Mmm-mmm.
This is dinner.

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.804
These are dessert.

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:45.849
Well, how do you know
what flavors they all are?

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:49.651
It's like a chocolate Russian roulette.
It's part of the fun.

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.248
We'd be surprised
by the ones we liked

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:52.724
and the ones we didn't.

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:53.987
Okay.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.223
And...

01:05:58.554 --> 01:05:59.692
You don't like it?

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:01.234
I do not like that one.

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:04.168
Here. Try this one I think
you'd like this one.

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:11.107
Oh?
Mmm.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.271
Told you.
Okay.

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.582
Your turn.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.715
Are we going shot for shot?

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.890
Wait till you try
their hot chocolate.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:32.023
We would come here
whenever it snowed.

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:34.090
Are you trying to make me
diabetic or just fat?

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.533
No, I...

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:42.298
You got a...
It's still in your hair.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:59.088
So, we come down here at
night and look at the lake?

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:02.158
That's not exactly what we do.

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:08.668
I... I'm not...

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:10.596
I don't...

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:11.967
No, no, it's not that.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.302
We said we'd go in
once a month every month,

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:15.740
and we haven't done April yet.

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.641
We started in July.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:24.248
Why? Why would we do that?

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:26.115
We were at
this spaghetti place,

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:28.177
and we had this waiter
and he said he did it.

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:30.655
And he was, like, 80.
So we thought we could.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.191
Yeah.

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.918
Now, we said
no wetsuits, but...

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.121
You're serious.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:37.687
...for you, I guess
I'll make an exception.

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:47.437
All right. Turn around.

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.500
Turn around.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.281
Okay.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:04.986
Wait. No wetsuit?

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:06.287
We said no wetsuits, right?

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:11.988
Yeah.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.636
Oh, no.

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:19.296
No, no. No, no!

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.416
Come on.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:46.692
Thank you.

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.564
Heat, heat.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.502
My left eyelid's frozen shut.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.370
I can't feel my fingers.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.011
I can't feel them.

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:20.027
I don't know what your
Paige did on a first date,

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:24.367
but with me, you're
only getting to first base.

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.468
Okay.

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.408
I'm sorry.
I can do better.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.416
My... My lips
are still numb.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.243
It's nice.

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.926
Second base, tops.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:55.096
This is perfect.

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:18.985
Thank you for coming out
with me tonight.

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:21.288
I had a really nice time.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.694
I've missed you.

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:30.436
I miss our life together.
I miss being with you.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.375
I love you.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:47.112
I should probably get inside.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:51.689
Good night.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.191
Good night.

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:13.744
Hey.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.680
Hey. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.944
Were you out with Jeremy?

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.282
No.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.451
I was with Leo.

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.551
I like him.

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:30.424
Yeah.

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.289
Me, too.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:36.592
Are you okay?

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:45.074
Paige, I've never seen
you like this before.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.580
I mean, is this
crying thing the new you?

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:49.547
Because it's bizarre.

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.551
I don't know.
I don't know what's me.

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:53.211
I have a tattoo.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.652
And I'm a vegetarian, too.

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:03.761
Look, it was just like it used to be.
It was better, actually.

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.327
Everything that
I fell in love with

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:08.663
about Paige is still there.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:12.165
You know, to you,
I'm sure it seemed

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.604
like a confirmation
of your love

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.437
or your marriage, right?

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.805
But to her,
it probably seemed more

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.310
like a really good first date.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.346
Exactly. Which is why
I think you've gotta wait

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.972
the requisite three days
before you call.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:24.244
I gotta wait three days

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.785
to call after a date
with my own wife?

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.412
At least. This is a unique case.
Maybe longer.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:29.512
It can't be longer.

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:30.817
I'm gonna see her
on Saturday at the wedding.

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.756
I'm telling you,
it was so obvious.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:35.796
Even with all this crazy shit going on
around us, we still belong together.

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.194
Obvious to her or to you?

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.822
To both of us.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.858
- Oh. Oh, Paige?
- Yeah?

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:44.938
We have to start writing out
those place cards after we eat.

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:46.336
Yes.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.975
Before you start on that,

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:53.644
I have a little surprise
for you, Paige.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:55.440
Oh?

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:57.279
You know Ray Porter, right?

01:12:57.339 --> 01:13:00.013
He taught constitutional law
at Northwestern.

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:01.645
He and I were on
law review together.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.122
We've known each other
1,000 years.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.116
He is the dean of
the law school now.

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.286
Okay.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.057
And they're gonna
let you back in.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.722
What?

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.299
Well...

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:16.060
I didn't even apply.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.831
I took care of it.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:23.036
This is crazy.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:28.344
I feel like I'm getting
a free do-over in life.

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.804
You look like
you could use a drink.

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.738
I've already had several.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.939
But you haven't had this.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.582
All right.

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.614
I'm glad we're
having a moment alone.

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:18.180
I haven't gotten a chance
to really talk to you, Leo.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.655
Yeah.

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.421
Yeah, cool.

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:24.090
Congratulations.

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:29.796
That's nice.

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:30.962
Yes, it is.

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.597
I've been thinking.

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:40.841
And I think that it's probably
time to let us take it from here.

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.210
Take what?

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:44.646
Things with Paige.

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:48.015
Look, I know she didn't have
health insurance because

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:51.114
you chose to live
in a certain way,

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.124
and I know you must
be drowning in debt.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.788
But I also know
away out of this.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.022
What's that?

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:02.658
Divorce her.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.168
The bills have
only just begun, Leo.

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:10.534
Mr. Thornton, I don't think
this is the time

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:12.305
or the place to discuss this.

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:15.371
Fine. If you don't care
about losing your business,

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:18.178
which, clearly, you don't,

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.412
what about Paige?

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.146
What about doing
what is obviously

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.483
the right thing for her?

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.682
And you know
what's right for her?

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:24.815
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.084
You're such a hypocrite.

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:28.320
What did you say?

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:31.364
If you're such
a family man, how come I...

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.763
I never once saw
you come and try

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.856
to put things back
together with Paige?

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.538
You're such a coward.

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.886
Hey, can I introduce
you around a little bit?

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.289
Can't feel good to
be the odd man out.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.057
I'm not the odd man out.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.629
All right.
If you say so.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.792
You just seem a little creepy
over here all by yourself.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.891
I'm just waiting
for Paige, man.

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.131
All right, well,
best of luck with that.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:13.706
You like this, right?

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.300
I'm sorry, like what?

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:17.934
Paige leaves you behind.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:19.876
She goes and has
this life without you,

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:21.744
with some guy that no one gets.

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.373
And now you get to
see her reject all that.

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:26.618
I mean, I like it a little bit.

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:28.118
Yeah?

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.212
Well, let me
tell you what I like.

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:31.814
I like the fact
that Paige told me

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:32.983
everything about you, Jeremy.

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:35.087
Okay.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.290
She told me that
when she was with you,

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.627
she would wake up
at night in a panic,

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.168
thinking,
"Is this all there is?"

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:44.960
Wow.

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:46.333
She told you everything, huh?

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:47.498
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.006
Did she tell you
that she threw herself

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.167
at me the other day?

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:52.142
Did she tell you that?

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.271
Or did she stop
telling you everything

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.940
when she forgot
who the hell you were?

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:00.286
Look, I get why
you're being such a dick.

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.252
You obviously love her,

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.789
and you think you're
gonna get her back.

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:07.116
But the thing is,
she outgrew you.

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.959
What makes you think
that won't happen again?

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:12.465
Thank you for that advice.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:15.092
I will mull it over while
I'm in bed with your wife.

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.031
Leo!

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:31.207
Paige, wait!

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.444
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:33.850
I don't know. That's
a really good question,

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.684
because I have been
driving myself insane,

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:39.054
making a complete ass
of myself!

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.683
Literally trying
everything possible

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:42.022
to try to save what we have.

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:44.154
And you've been throwing
yourself at Jeremy.

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:46.159
That's not fair.

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.359
It's not fair?

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:51.802
I see the way you look at him.

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:54.902
I know,

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:59.010
because you used to
look at me that way.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:02.974
Leo, I..

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.813
No, I think we need to
start being realistic.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.648
Your memory's not coming back.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.417
The fact is that
I'm still just a stranger.

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:14.520
I'm not trying to hurt you.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.356
But I'm just...

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:24.670
I'm so tired of
disappointing you.

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.002
I know.

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:31.369
I'm so sorry.

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:37.281
I'll apologize
to Gwen and Ryan.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:40.114
Oh, God, no, it's fine.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:45.422
Wedding disasters have a way
of turning into great stories.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.694
Eventually.

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:57.267
How do you look at
the girl you love

01:19:57.359 --> 01:20:00.363
and tell yourself
it's time to walk away?

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:11.307
Leg?

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:19.551
I hope one day I can love
the way that you love me.

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:24.955
You figured it out once.

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:28.401
You'll do it again.

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:45.376
Shit.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.805
You're here, not there.

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.176
Are you okay?

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:51.546
I'm done.

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:54.351
It's over. I give up.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.683
No, you never give up, Leo.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.191
No, if we were
meant to be together,

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:00.624
we would be together.

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:04.855
I was just thinking
about the first time

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.695
that we went to
that Greek restaurant

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.257
on the corner.

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.302
There was
this big banner saying.

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:11.803
"Now Serving Soup,"

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.968
and I just started to
go on and on.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:18.306
About all the obstacles

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.038
that the owner
must have overcome

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.581
to achieve his lifelong dream
of serving soup.

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.885
And then...
And when I was finished...

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:30.614
She didn't say anything
for a few seconds

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:31.952
and she just...

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:36.322
She just sort of exhaled it.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.224
It was almost to herself.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.326
"I love you."

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:47.098
And it just hung there.

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:49.901
It was the first time
she had said it,

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.138
and I didn't
even wanna respond.

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:54.736
I just wanted to
keep hearing it.

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:59.809
That was two weeks
after we met.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.479
It only took her two weeks

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:05.785
to fall in love with me before.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.600
She doesn't love me.

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.520
Sign here, please.

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:51.054
Come here, little buddy.

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.032
Diane?

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.201
Hey.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.105
How are you?
Listen...

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.977
I know it's been years.

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:13.552
I was away for awhile.

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:16.984
I never had a chance
to apologize.

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:20.758
I was just going through
a really weird time,

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:23.761
but your dad ended it

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.892
as soon as your mother
confronted him about us.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.903
And I just always
wanted you to know that.

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:33.963
I don't mean to
open old wounds, but...

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:37.839
I just really needed
to say that I'm sorry.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.006
No, I'm really glad
that you said something.

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:44.811
You were always
a really good friend.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.613
I just wish I could've
returned the favor.

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:51.651
The lilies were bad,
so I got sunflowers instead.

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.663
I wanted to tell you.

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:04.862
You knew?

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.107
You knew the whole time?

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:11.474
I'm sorry.
Don't talk to me.

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:14.514
Paige. Paige. Paige!

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:20.280
Hey, where have you
been all day, stranger?

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.352
Hmm?

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:23.850
Paige?

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.688
I ran into Diane Chain
at the store.

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:33.732
That's why I left, isn't it?
Because I found out.

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:39.068
Mom, I barely
even know who I am,

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.538
and then it turns out
you're lying to me,

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:45.076
and you've used my accident
to rewrite the past?

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.708
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you again.

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:54.313
Do you have any idea how
betrayed I feel right now?

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.377
I'm sorry, Paige.

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:58.718
We were happier than
we'd been in years.

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.019
Oh, Mom!

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:01.685
We finally had you back again.

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.023
Back on your terms!

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:04.256
No!

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:06.525
Yes, as usual!
Paige!

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:09.728
He cheated on you
with my friend!

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:13.168
How could you stay with him?

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.667
I...

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:20.338
I was going to leave.

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:24.675
I was.
I was all ready to leave.

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:29.685
And then one afternoon, I
was all alone in the house,

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:35.252
and I started looking at
all the photographs of you

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:37.588
and your...

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.530
And your sister.

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:46.694
And the house seemed
so full of all of us.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:51.137
We were a family, Paige.

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:55.408
And I realized
in that moment that

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:59.745
that was the most important
thing in the world for me.

01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:02.985
And I couldn't, I couldn't,

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:06.282
I could not go.

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:10.957
So, you just WASPed it away?

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:12.556
No.

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:16.935
I chose to stay with him

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:21.232
for all the things
that he had done right

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:26.902
and not to leave him for the one
thing that he had done wrong.

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.442
I chose to forgive him.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.190
Maybe Leo was right.

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:45.957
Maybe I can't figure out who I
am and be around all of you.

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:03.003
I still feel a little chilly.
I don't care what you say.

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.851
That's fine.

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.313
Paige.

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:18.458
I'm sorry.

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:19.657
Is everything okay?

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:26.062
Look, you two obviously need
to talk, so I'm just...

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.662
Okay.
Talk to you later.

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.367
All right, bye.

01:29:31.999 --> 01:29:33.740
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:37.307
What happened?

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.148
Can I ask you something?

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:42.415
Yeah.

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.856
You can always ask me anything.

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:49.154
Did you know
about my dad's affair?

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:51.691
Yeah.

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:53.661
I knew.

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:01.700
Why didn't you tell me?

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:12.406
There were so many times
that I almost did.

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:18.182
But to drive you away
from your family again?

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.551
That just felt wrong.

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:24.528
I wanted your love, I...

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:26.428
Just not like that.

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:29.565
I wanted to earn it.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:49.081
I just don't think I can
afford to lose them right now.

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.324
So don't.

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:04.735
Certain parties have sought
to nullify various congressional acts,

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:07.636
claiming that repeated extensions
of copyright protection

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.833
constitute
a perpetual copyright

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:13.936
of the sort the drafters of the
Constitution would have rejected.

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.503
The United States
Supreme Court,

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:18.743
in the 2003 case
of <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft...</i>

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:27.824
Thanks for lunch.

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:31.488
Actually, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:32.758
Okay.

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:36.134
Things are over with Rose.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.134
I ended it, Paige.

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:42.703
No. Why did you do that?

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:44.606
I thought you were
getting engaged...

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.269
We were,
but that was before you.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.813
No, that was after me.

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:50.042
Okay, it was after you,
but it was before this you.

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:52.014
It was before
the old you came back.

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:56.181
Jeremy, I'm not the old me.

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.882
I'm just me.

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:02.556
I'm just the me that's trying
to figure it out still.

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:04.793
I understand,
but, whichever it is,

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:07.799
the old you or the new you,
I don't care.

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:10.798
I know you remember
what we were like together.

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:11.962
I know you do.

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.505
This is our chance
to get that back.

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:15.163
What we had was wonderful.

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:17.800
Those were wonderful memories,
but those were...

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:19.970
Those are my only memories.

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.412
Everything after you is erased.

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.544
I...

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:31.585
I have to discover what it's like
to be without you, on my own.

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:35.219
Are you sure you don't remember

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:37.023
breaking up with me
the first time?

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:39.263
Why?

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:41.663
'Cause it sounded
a hell of a lot like that.

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:47.338
Let's go.

01:32:58.072 --> 01:33:00.848
Hey.
I was looking all over.

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:04.788
I was worried when I didn't
see you outside the library.

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:08.622
So...

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:14.628
How's that intellectual
property class going?

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:23.107
Actually, I wanna
talk to you about that.

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:26.779
I've decided to
leave law school.

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.875
And I'm gonna get
an apartment in the city.

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:34.275
It's happening
all over again, isn't it?

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.082
Damn it, Paige.

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:39.115
I've made a lot of mistakes.

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:44.124
Dad, this isn't about you
or anything you've done.

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:48.997
This is about me,
who I want to be, who I am.

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:54.900
Just tell me what to say,
so I don't lose you again.

01:33:58.232 --> 01:33:59.836
You won't.

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:10.115
<i>A moment of impact.</i>

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:20.462
<i>A moment of impact
whose potential for change</i>

01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:23.991
<i>has ripple effects far
beyond what we can predict,</i>

01:34:27.194 --> 01:34:30.107
<i>sending some particles
crashing together</i>

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:34.644
<i>making them closer than before,</i>

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:44.385
<i>while sending others spinning
off into great ventures</i>

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:50.557
<i>landing where you never
thought you'd find them.</i>

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:57.534
<i>You see, that's the thing
about moments like these.</i>

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:00.065
<i>You can't,</i>

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.171
<i>no matter how hard you try,</i>

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.640
<i>control how
they're gonna affect you.</i>

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:12.144
<i>You just gotta Jet the colliding
particles land where they may</i>

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:17.247
<i>and wait until
the next collision.</i>

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:28.167
<i>I vow to help you love life,</i>

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:30.600
<i>to always hold you
with tenderness,</i>

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:33.570
<i>and to have the patience
that love demands.</i>

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:35.766
<i>To speak when words are needed</i>

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:38.537
<i>and to share the silence
when they're not.</i>

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:42.172
<i>To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.</i>

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:45.180
<i>And to live within
the warmth of your heart</i>

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:46.877
<i>and always call it home.</i>

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:34.258
Hi.

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:38.635
Hi.

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:43.837
I hope you didn't
come all the way

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:45.308
into the city
for hot chocolate.

01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:49.108
Actually, I moved
back here six months ago.

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.275
I'm over in Rogers Park.

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:55.110
Really? That...
That's great.

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:57.622
I'm actually back
at the Art Institute.

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:59.248
What?
Are you kidding me?

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:00.483
Mmm-mmm.

01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:01.753
That's amazing.

01:37:01.816 --> 01:37:04.763
Yeah. I mean, I'm sitting
in on a few classes,

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:09.199
and it's crazy
what my hands remember

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:12.271
that my, you know,
that my mind forgot.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.703
Yeah.

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.837
So, thank you.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.979
I didn't do anything.

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:22.878
You did everything.

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:27.548
You accepted me for who I am,

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:31.152
and not for
what you wanted me to be.

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:37.159
I just wanted you to be happy.

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.632
That's all.

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:51.200
Isn't there some
Cuban place around here

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:55.144
where we used to go
when this place was closed?

01:37:56.871 --> 01:37:59.875
Yeah. It's... Wait.
You remember?

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:01.913
No, no.

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:04.720
I wish.

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:09.184
No, the memory stuff
hasn't come back, but I've...

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:13.058
Sonia and I have been
hanging out a little bit,

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:16.999
and I've been
asking her about us.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.366
Really?
And what has she been saying?

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:25.777
That she doesn't think you're

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:27.573
seeing anyone right now.

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:33.245
She just happens to be right.

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:39.122
You? Are you seeing anyone?

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:46.292
That's good.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.429
So, do you wanna go
to the Cuban place?

01:38:51.358 --> 01:38:52.735
With me?

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:55.897
Okay.

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:57.940
Okay.

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.047
What would you say
to trying someplace

01:39:03.103 --> 01:39:04.946
that we haven't been to before?

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.746
Someplace new?

01:39:07.641 --> 01:39:09.314
I'd like that.

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:11.121
After you.
