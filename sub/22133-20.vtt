no Jess

23:22.579 --> 23:26.240
yeah

23:27.279 --> 23:30.279
just like that thought

23:33.259 --> 23:39.410
your gaze

23:39.410 --> 23:42.410
trouble in paradise

23:42.410 --> 23:45.410
it's called strategizing

23:46.369 --> 23:50.869
this is nuts man i'm not forfeiting .
case you can barely walk let alone

23:50.869 --> 23:54.500
navigate the rapids okay you put
yourself am a team at risk

23:54.500 --> 23:58.819
Sean jason is a professional lifeguard I
think he knows his limitations when he

23:58.819 --> 24:00.439
calls it quits then I'll follow

24:00.440 --> 24:03.680
but if he says he's fine i think we
should keep moving she's got a point

24:04.400 --> 24:08.030
we can help Jason through this it's not
like his ankles broken it's a sprain

24:08.029 --> 24:10.910
I'm sorry Jessie I'm pulling the plug
all right now there's more at stake here

24:10.910 --> 24:13.550
than just this competition you're right
Sean

24:13.549 --> 24:18.769
there is Sean look this is the beach and
I'm cool really should at least give

24:18.769 --> 24:22.819
Jason a chance and I think it's pretty
clear that you're the only one here who

24:22.819 --> 24:23.809
wants to quit

24:23.809 --> 24:27.740
I say we take a vote this isn't a
democracy all right

24:27.740 --> 24:31.220
it's about what's best for us as a team
all right and I think I know a little

24:31.220 --> 24:32.839
something about that Jesse

24:32.839 --> 24:37.519
all those in favor of continuing on ai
ai ai

24:38.119 --> 24:41.119
hi

24:44.190 --> 24:47.548
ok

24:48.519 --> 24:52.419
well it'll be difficult but we can do it
well we're gonna have to scale the face

24:52.419 --> 24:56.469
this suckers you get to the white water
rafting leg dude

24:56.469 --> 25:00.070
yeah that's going to take strength
balance all our faculties tough to do on

25:00.069 --> 25:01.178
a sprained ankle

25:01.179 --> 25:02.840
I can do it

25:02.839 --> 25:08.029
just listen to yourself I know you will
do it but can you really took us twice

25:08.029 --> 25:10.190
as long just to get this first
checkpoint

25:10.190 --> 25:12.980
Shawn you've been outvoted

25:12.980 --> 25:15.980
Jesse we had an agreement all right now
somebody's gonna get hurt

25:15.980 --> 25:20.179
also you can win a competition this
isn't about winning Sean about giving

25:20.179 --> 25:23.480
your word and keeping it about helping
out friends

25:23.480 --> 25:27.349
all right something is obviously going
on here that I don't get

25:28.038 --> 25:32.538
I can tell you this Jase friends don't
ask for more than friends can give

25:32.538 --> 25:36.288
so what's up I need this

25:36.288 --> 25:40.278
and yeah I need to win and if Jason and
Zach are willing to go for it can't you

25:40.278 --> 25:41.599
as well

25:41.599 --> 25:44.480
sorry Jessie I can

25:44.480 --> 25:48.980
Jason's fine hell Sean can't you just
stop trying to control every situation

25:48.980 --> 25:52.400
we're not at the center or under your
watchful eye

25:52.400 --> 25:56.509
our competitors ok Jess yeah I guess
you're going through some pretty tough

25:56.509 --> 26:00.140
stuff and it's got you confused but a
member of our team is injured all right

26:00.140 --> 26:03.919
if we continue he can seriously injured
that ankle know this isn't about me or

26:03.919 --> 26:04.759
the center

26:04.759 --> 26:07.730
this is about the values that we
committed our lives to this is about our

26:07.730 --> 26:08.569
team

26:08.569 --> 26:10.059
we're doing

26:10.059 --> 26:13.809
this all right fine Jace

26:13.809 --> 26:16.690
you know you make choices in life you
have to live with them I'm cool with

26:16.690 --> 26:17.470
that

26:17.470 --> 26:20.559
I can tell you this go on you're going
on without me

26:21.069 --> 26:23.569
and you can forget about coming back to
work

26:23.569 --> 26:26.569
one's come on one

26:27.470 --> 26:30.529
now you're resorting to blackmail

26:30.529 --> 26:32.819
oh no not blackmail risk management

26:32.819 --> 26:34.418
it's simple Jace

26:34.419 --> 26:37.730
the showdown for Baywatch

26:37.730 --> 26:40.730
they watch team no choice bra

26:41.680 --> 26:43.019
Jason

26:43.019 --> 26:44.908
we can do this

26:44.909 --> 26:47.909
can

26:50.859 --> 26:52.990
- on the team

26:52.990 --> 26:54.808
great

26:54.808 --> 26:57.619
thanks a lot

26:57.619 --> 26:59.899
not Jesse

26:59.900 --> 27:01.490
Jesse

27:01.490 --> 27:05.839
Jesse still looking for that drugstore
cowboy

27:08.999 --> 27:12.538
checking for cameras why else would you
be here unless there's a photo

27:12.538 --> 27:14.429
opportunity involved

27:14.429 --> 27:17.788
I don't know you tell me Lee what are my
real motives for being here today

27:18.749 --> 27:19.788
maybe

27:19.788 --> 27:23.599
came to watch me in charge waiting for
me to screw up so you can put it on the

27:23.599 --> 27:26.599
center now the real estate group would
just love that

27:27.730 --> 27:32.710
you know what's so in my constituents a
hotel provides job opportunities

27:32.710 --> 27:36.279
stimulate the local economy what can
they watch possibly due to stack up

27:36.279 --> 27:36.849
against

27:36.849 --> 27:40.119
nothing we don't make people rich

27:40.119 --> 27:44.589
we try to keep them safe which is
exactly why I'm here today I'm not the

27:44.589 --> 27:48.549
kind of politician who stands around
while my teachers are short on lifeguard

27:48.549 --> 27:55.119
oh I get it contrary to popular belief
you really do care about something other

27:55.119 --> 27:56.409
than yourself

27:56.410 --> 28:00.160
maybe we maybe this whole cold-hearted
witch thing is just a nap

28:03.329 --> 28:09.000
pray I already told you guys 10 * movie
or game away from the crowd that makes

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
11 by my company

28:14.579 --> 28:17.179

your nest a mess they're both strong
like those

28:30.109 --> 28:34.609

28:34.609 --> 28:38.299
I will pull every permit you have on
file until you decide if the board

28:40.839 --> 28:43.839

28:52.849 --> 28:57.230
Sean man look I was possessed ok

28:57.230 --> 29:01.549
it was like demonic I mean I don't think
it was even my voice is said I never

29:01.549 --> 29:05.869
catch me saying i am much more of your
time with your brother

29:06.579 --> 29:09.908
I mean you think we should consult the
priests let me get back his I don't want

29:09.909 --> 29:13.360
any bad juju Zach I know what was going
on it's cool with me okay

29:13.898 --> 29:17.949
I was shown that look I just hope i
didn't I mean my little blender didn't

29:17.950 --> 29:23.110
put me in the doghouse because I mean it
was stupid and really cool

29:23.109 --> 29:27.669
look everybody wants a while needs to be
reminded what's important to you

29:27.670 --> 29:30.670
everyone okay

29:32.819 --> 29:37.138
just look I'm sorry forget it you blow
it okay and Sean just took advantage of

29:37.138 --> 29:38.428
the whole situation

29:38.429 --> 29:41.820
I choose they watch over me anything
come on it's not over yet and we can

29:41.819 --> 29:44.788
figure a way to make circle work for
spin on it

29:44.788 --> 29:49.888
no Jason we can't trail tracker wanted
an account of the competition and they

29:49.888 --> 29:51.269
wanted us to finish it

29:51.269 --> 29:54.569
we barely made it to the first
checkpoint they don't want soap opera

29:54.569 --> 29:55.589
they want action

29:55.589 --> 29:59.278
stop it but just the JD dated

29:59.278 --> 30:05.069
she was a fighter she never gave up it
sure was scared anything love being a

30:05.069 --> 30:08.069
lifeguard respect to chop

30:09.029 --> 30:11.940
you wouldn't be the same ball

30:11.940 --> 30:15.990
well that just disappeared the moment
she woke up and found out she was a

30:15.990 --> 30:18.028
single mom with no career

30:18.028 --> 30:21.240
this was my shot Jason this was it

30:23.849 --> 30:28.379
yeah

30:29.069 --> 30:34.529
there goes your boyfriend lately I feel
my heart fluttering already you know

30:34.529 --> 30:37.558
believe it or not i really do think we
have something in common

30:37.558 --> 30:41.339
yeah how so when you set your mind to
something you don't stop until you get

30:41.339 --> 30:42.000
it

30:42.000 --> 30:45.269
no argument there course you do have a
better way of keeping friends in the

30:45.269 --> 30:52.079
process than I do admire that Lee we
have something else in common - you're

30:52.079 --> 30:55.079
talking about Shawn you got it

30:56.210 --> 31:00.230
no Jenna we really ought to go out
sometime and leave our genders of the

31:00.230 --> 31:01.339
door

31:01.339 --> 31:04.699
maybe even compare notes

31:04.700 --> 31:07.700

31:08.569 --> 31:11.079
