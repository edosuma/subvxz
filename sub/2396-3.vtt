00:01.130 --> 00:03.496
PREVIOUSLY
ON "VERONICA MARS"...

00:03.500 --> 00:06.060
THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ARTICLE
IN THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.231
YOU NEED TO GET RID
OF THE MARIJUANA.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.707
KAREN HAS CANCER.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.804
THIS BOTANY PROFESSOR GAVE HER
SOME SEEDS.

00:12.810 --> 00:15.734
SHE WON'T JUST LOSE HER JOB.
SHE'LL LOSE HER INSURANCE.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.207
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

00:17.210 --> 00:20.316
WELL DONE, SISTER.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.743
HOW MANY WOMEN LIKE ME
HAVE TO BE RAPED

00:22.750 --> 00:25.514
BEFORE THIS ADMINISTRATION
LISTENS TO OUR DEMANDS?

00:25.520 --> 00:28.318
YOUR ROOM KEY?
WHAT IF I DROP IN UNEXPECTEDLY?

00:28.320 --> 00:31.983
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE.
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT BY NOW.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.799
Fry:
IS IT TOO TOUGH?

00:33.800 --> 00:37.190
INSTEAD OF SKIPPING MEETINGS,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST QUIT?

00:37.200 --> 00:39.430
FOCUS ON YOUR PHILOSOPHY
FULL-TIME.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.069
YOU READ YOUR PLATO,
DRINK YOUR ESPRESSO,

00:43.070 --> 00:44.867
EAT ALL THE CHEESE YOU WANT.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.406
Veronica: FOOTBALL --

00:46.410 --> 00:49.072
THE SYSTEMATIC VIOLATION
OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION

00:49.080 --> 00:50.479
MADE INTO A SPORT.

00:50.480 --> 00:54.917
I'M SURPRISED THE ASPCA
DOESN'T PROTEST.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.444
LIKE THESE LADIES.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.782
"WE GO TO HEARST.
GO AHEAD AND RAPE US."

00:58.790 --> 01:01.714
OH, BOY.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.551
NUDITY.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.552
IF YOU HAVE WORDS WRI'I'I'EN
ON YOURSELF, IT'S NOT NUDITY.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.495
IT'S POLITICAL SPEECH,
TAKING CONTROL OF ONE'S BODY

01:09.500 --> 01:12.367
TO TURN THE OBJECTIFYING
MALE GAZE BACK ON ITSELF.

01:12.370 --> 01:14.736
OKAY, NO MORE COLLEGE
FOR YOU.

01:18.310 --> 01:21.029
SO, LOGAN,
SEE YOU AT THE PARTY?

01:21.040 --> 01:22.200
ABSOLUTELY.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.098
BRING YOUR FRIEND
IF YOU WANT.

01:24.110 --> 01:26.340
NEW FRIENDS?

01:26.350 --> 01:28.409
YEAH,
FROM WEIGHT-LIFl'ING CLASS.

01:28.420 --> 01:31.116
RIGHT, THE ONLY CLASS
YOU NEVER MISS.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.519
SO, WHAT, YOU GUYS, LIKE,

01:32.520 --> 01:35.489
SPOT EACH OTHER DOING
SQUAT TH RUSTS AND STUFF?

01:35.490 --> 01:38.050
AND HAVE GROUP SEX
IN THE SHOWERS.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.527
WHAT IS THIS, JEALOUS?

01:39.530 --> 01:42.260
OH, JEALOUS WOULD INVOLVE
PIANO WIRE.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.568
OH.
SO WHAT WAS THAT?

01:44.570 --> 01:46.663
THAT WAS MILD ANNOYANCE
AT THE FACT

01:46.670 --> 01:49.366
THAT TWO GYM BUDDIES
INVITE YOU TO A PARTY,

01:49.370 --> 01:50.928
AND YOU'RE THERE ALREADY.

01:50.940 --> 01:54.137
WHENEVER I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
INTERESTING, YOU'RE BUSY.

01:54.140 --> 01:56.279
YOU MEAN INTERESTING
LIKE SOME FOSSIL

01:56.280 --> 01:57.577
WHEEZING THROUGH A NOVEL?

01:57.580 --> 01:59.377
FIRST, MARTIN AMIS
ISN'T A FOSSIL,

01:59.380 --> 02:01.143
AND, SECOND, YES,
IT'S COLLEGE.

02:01.150 --> 02:02.686
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EXPAND
OUR HORIZONS

02:02.690 --> 02:04.544
PAST VIDEO GAMES
AND BINGE DRINKING.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.814
MY HORIZONS GO
SLIGHTLY BEYOND THAT.
GREAT.

02:06.820 --> 02:10.278
SO HOW ABOUT TONIGHT WE CHECK
OUT THE ART-MAJOR GROUP SHOW?

02:10.290 --> 02:11.655
I'M BUSY?

02:11.660 --> 02:13.855
NO, REALLY, I HAVE A CLASS
TILL 10:00.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.499
BUT YOU COME BY AFI'ERWARDS,
WE COULD WRITE ON OURSELVES,

02:16.500 --> 02:20.129
GET REAL POLITICAL.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.664
THAT'S WHAT
A GIRL LIKES TO HEAR.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.366
"DARLING, DO ALL
THE WEIRD CRAP YOU LIKE.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.406
JUST DON'T BE LATE
FOR THE BOOTY CALL."

02:26.410 --> 02:28.469
REALLY, HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT SOUNDS?

02:28.480 --> 02:29.970
I THINK
IT SOUNDS ROMANTIC.

02:29.980 --> 02:32.244
YOU ALSO THINK WEIGHT LIFI'ING
IS AN ACTUAL CLASS.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.810
BYE. I'VE GOT ERRANDS.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.636
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:56.640 --> 02:59.529
THE GUY IN THE S.U.V.
LOOKS LIKE HE DIGS MAGIC,

02:59.540 --> 03:01.201
SO I'M GETTING MY DOVES.

03:01.210 --> 03:02.643
I'M LEAVING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:02.650 --> 03:04.606
MY SHIFI' ENDED
HALF AN HOUR AGO, MAN.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.316
NOT TILL RAY-RAY
GETS HERE.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.015
SCREW YOU.
I'VE BEEN WASHING THESE --

03:08.020 --> 03:09.487
HEY! NO LIP.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.947
WORK OR IT'S BACK
TO CHINO.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.156
HEY, HEY, HEY!

03:13.160 --> 03:15.378
I HIT MY BOSS ONCE.

03:15.390 --> 03:18.052
IT WASN'T QUITE WORTH
THE EXTRA YEAR.

03:18.060 --> 03:20.494
ALL RIGHT?

03:20.500 --> 03:21.990
I GUESS I'LL GO WASH

03:27.970 --> 03:29.631
I'M NOT SPOILED,

03:29.640 --> 03:33.303
AND, TECHNICALLY,
IT WASN'T FOR GRADUATION.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.709
WHAT ABOUT
THE BITCH PART?

03:34.710 --> 03:38.248
THAT DEPENDS
ON WHO YOU ASK.

03:38.250 --> 03:41.515
HOW ARE YOU, WEEVIL?
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.341
SINCE THAT AWKWARD
ARRESTED-FOR-MURDER INCIDENT?

03:44.350 --> 03:45.715
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.779
YOU PLEA BARGAINED
DOWN TO ASSAULT?

03:47.790 --> 03:49.485
AND NOW I'M WORKING
AT THE CAR WASH,

03:49.490 --> 03:50.718
WHICH, AS IT TURNS OUT,

03:50.730 --> 03:52.357
IS NOT AS FUN
AS THE SONG MIGHT SOUND.

03:52.360 --> 03:53.827
[ CELLPHONE RINGS ]

03:53.830 --> 03:55.889
SHOOT.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.424
HELLO?

03:57.430 --> 04:00.331
SURE. OKAY.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.304
AND I'M BEING CALLED IN

04:03.310 --> 04:05.904
TO SEE THE DEAN
OF HEARST COLLEGE.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.901
THE LEOPARD DIDN'T CHANGE
HER SPOTS, I SEE.

04:07.910 --> 04:10.401
I WONDER IF HEARST KNOWS
ABOUHrEYYCRUR --

04:10.410 --> 04:12.640
YOU THINK I'M PAYING YOU
TO HARASS THE LADIES?

04:12.650 --> 04:16.177
SCREW OFF AGAIN, AND YOU'RE
OUT ON YOUR ASS, CHOLO.

04:16.180 --> 04:17.249
YOU GOT ME?

04:17.250 --> 04:18.740
WEEVIL, DON'T.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.186
I GOT YOU. NOW, WHAT SHOULD
I DO WITH YOU, HUH?

04:22.190 --> 04:26.820
YOU SHOULD LET ME GO SO I CAN
CALL YOUR PAROLE OFFICER.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.160
I DIDN'T CHANGE MY SPOTS,
EITHER.

04:32.170 --> 04:33.660
NICE SEEING YOU, "V."

04:36.370 --> 04:37.632
NO, NO, NO, LOOK.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.835
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ONE OF THOSE

04:39.840 --> 04:42.638
MUMBLY COLLEGE-RADIO
EMO-ROCKER GUYS

04:42.650 --> 04:45.539
WHO ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS PLAY
THEIR BAND'S DEMO, YOU KNOW,

04:45.550 --> 04:46.778
THOUGH I SHOULD MENTION

04:46.780 --> 04:48.816
THAT MY BAND REALLY IS
QUITE GOOD.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.414
WE'RE CALLED BLACK LICORICE,
WHICH IS REALLY COOL

04:51.420 --> 04:52.648
'CAUSE IT'S DARK AND MOODY

04:52.660 --> 04:54.412
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME,
IT'S CANDY.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.081
Trish: SO, YOU'RE PITCHING
WHAT, EXACTLY?

04:56.090 --> 04:59.218
A CALL-IN SHOW -- POLITICAL
AFFAIRS, CULTURAL AFFAIRS,

04:59.230 --> 05:00.424
WHATEVER AFFAIRS.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.660
WI'I'I'Y, SMART,
A LITTLE CRAZY.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.763
IT'S LIKE JON STEWART
MEETS "CROSSFIRE"

05:04.770 --> 05:06.863
IF JON STEWART
DIDN'T HATE "CROSSFIRE."

05:06.870 --> 05:09.430
HEY, TRISH, SORRY,
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE

05:09.440 --> 05:12.238
A THREE-RING BINDER
IN MY ROOM THIS MORNING?

05:12.240 --> 05:13.434
NO, WHAT'S WRONG?

05:13.440 --> 05:17.046
NO, IT'S NOTHING.
I'M JUST DEAD.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.670
DEAN O'DELL?

05:20.680 --> 05:24.446
THEY SAID
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.145
O'Dell:
WE CAN DOWNLOAD PICTURES

05:26.150 --> 05:28.948
FROM THE SURFACE OF THE MOONS
OF JUPITER ONTO PORTABLE PHONES,

05:28.960 --> 05:30.848
BUT WE CAN'T KEEP
THE AIR-CONDITIONING

05:30.860 --> 05:32.691
RUNNING FOR MORE
THAN A WEEK AT A TIME.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.055
IS THERE SOME CLUE
ABOUT THE HUMAN PREDICAMENT

05:35.060 --> 05:36.197
BURIED IN THAT FACT?

05:36.200 --> 05:37.599
I'M A FRESHMAN.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.263
I ONLY RECENTLY FIGURED OUT
WHERE WALDO WAS.

05:41.270 --> 05:43.067
PLEASE SIT.

05:43.070 --> 05:44.401
AH!

05:47.210 --> 05:48.632
YOUR KIDS?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.245
MY WIFE, MY SON
FROM A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE,

05:51.250 --> 05:52.911
AND MY STEPSON.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.617
MRS. O'DELL
WAS MY GRAD STUDENT

05:56.620 --> 05:59.612
BACK WHEN YOU COULD DO
THINGS LIKE THAT.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.623
SO, MISS MARS, IT'S RARE
WHEN A FRESHMAN

06:02.630 --> 06:06.122
MAKES QUITE AS BIG A SPLASH HERE
AS QUICKLY AS YOU HAVE.

06:06.130 --> 06:07.597
WELL DONE.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.022
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE FREE PRESS ARTICLE,

06:09.030 --> 06:11.498
THE SORORITY EXPOS --
SHARP PIECE OF WRITING.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.866
THANKS. ACTUALLY, THE EDITOR
TOOK SOME LIBERTIES.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.633
YOU WROTE
THAT A SOURCE TOLD YOU

06:15.640 --> 06:18.359
THAT THE HOUSE MOTHER
GOT HER POT SEEDS

06:18.370 --> 06:19.837
FROM A STAFF MEMBER HERE.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.946
I WANT TO KNOW WHO SAID IT
AND WHO THAT STAFFER WAS.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.601
ACTUALLY, DEAN O'DELL, I THINK
THAT'S COVERED UNDER --

06:25.610 --> 06:26.872
PROTECTION OF SOURCES --

06:26.880 --> 06:28.609
A FINE THING
FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES,

06:28.620 --> 06:30.588
BUT I WANT THAT NAME,
SO YOU CAN TELL ME

06:30.590 --> 06:33.150
OR I'LL HAVE YOU EXPELLED
FROM HEARST COLLEGE.

06:37.060 --> 06:41.053
* A LONG TIME AGO,
WE USED TO BE FRIENDS *

06:41.060 --> 06:46.760
* BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU
LATELY AT ALL *

06:47.400 --> 06:49.539
* COME ON, NOW, SUGAR *

06:49.540 --> 06:51.701
* BRING IT ON, BRING IT ON,
YEAH *

06:51.710 --> 06:55.578
* JUST REMEMBER ME WHEN *

06:55.580 --> 07:00.415
* WE USED TO BE FRIENDS
A LONG TIME AGO *

07:00.420 --> 07:02.684
* WE USED TO BE FRIENDS *

07:09.290 --> 07:10.951
I WOULDN'T GIVE DEAN O'DELL
THE NAME OF MY SOURCE.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.848
HE GAVE ME A WEEK
TO CHANGE MY MIND.

07:12.860 --> 07:16.660
PIZ,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:16.670 --> 07:19.594
WALLACE TOLD ME YOU WORKED
AT THE INFORMATION DESK.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.158
YOU NEED
SOME INFORMATION?

07:21.170 --> 07:22.808
OKAY,
SLUGS HAVE FOUR NOSES.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.732
THAT'S WHAT
I'M OFFERING TODAY.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.537
I ACTUALLY NEED
MORE LIKE A FAVOR.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.531
MY FUTURE MENTOR IN RADIO --
KNOCK ON WOOD --

07:28.540 --> 07:31.873
HAS A BOYFRIEND WITH A PROBLEM,
AND I'M TRYING TO IMPRESS HER.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.848
Kurt:
OUR FOOTBALL PLAYBOOKS

07:33.850 --> 07:36.318
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO LEAVE
THE ATHLETIC COMPLEX,

07:36.320 --> 07:38.982
BUT I MISSED A FEW MEETINGS
FOR A LECTURE.

07:38.990 --> 07:41.356
I NEEDED TO CATCH UP,
SO I HAD IT IN MY BAG.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.227
WE TURN IN EACH WEEK'S GAME
PLANS AND NEW PLAYS ON MONDAYS.

07:44.230 --> 07:47.722
IF I DON'T HAVE IT, THEY'RE
GONNA YANK MY SCHOLARSHIP.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.369
SO, STAYING ON THE TEAM
IS WORTH $500,

07:50.370 --> 07:51.962
WHICH IS MY FEE.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.768
YOU SAID IT WAS
YOUR FRIENDS RATE.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.362
IT WAS MY
FRIENDS-OF-FRIENDS RATE,

07:56.370 --> 07:59.771
WHICH I'VE NOW EXTENDED TO
FRIENDS OF FRIENDS OF FRIENDS.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.078
FINE. I MEAN,
I CAN'T GO TO THE COPS.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.742
IT WOULD JUST BE ADMI'ITING
I LOST IT

08:04.750 --> 08:06.342
OR, WORSE, IT WAS STOLEN.

08:06.350 --> 08:08.875
STOLEN, LIKE,
BY ANOTHER TEAM?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.643
OR SOMEONE WHO WANTS HIM
OFF THE TEAM.

08:10.650 --> 08:13.210
SHE'S TALKING
ABOUT MY POSITION COACH.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.256
I WAS A BIG DEAL,
STARTED HERE AS A FRESHMAN,

08:15.260 --> 08:17.182
BUT THEN I TORE MY ACL
END OF LAST SEASON,

08:17.190 --> 08:19.078
AND NOW I DON'T SEE
MUCH PLAYING TIME.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.955
AS FAR
AS COACH IS CONCERNED,

08:20.960 --> 08:22.860
I'M JUST A WASTE
OF A SCHOLARSHIP.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.121
SO, TELL ME
ABOUT THAT NIGHT,

08:24.130 --> 08:25.768
EVERY PLACE
YOU COULD HAVE LOST IT,

08:25.770 --> 08:27.192
EVERY PERSON
WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN IT.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.895
IT WAS IN MY BAG
THE WHOLE TIME.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.367
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO STUDY IT.

08:30.370 --> 08:32.031
I NEVER UNZIPPED IT
UNTIL TODAY.

08:32.040 --> 08:32.938
THIS BAG?

08:32.940 --> 08:35.306
YEAH.
I HAD IT ALL NIGHT.

08:35.310 --> 08:36.868
I MET TRISH,

08:36.880 --> 08:39.371
AND WE WENT TO THE ART SHOW
AT THE STUDENT UNION.

08:39.380 --> 08:44.215
MY FRIEND LARRY HAD A FEW
MASTERPIECES ON DISPLAY.

08:44.220 --> 08:47.109
THEN I WENT BACK TO MY ROOM,
AND MY BUDDY POP --

08:47.120 --> 08:50.886
BRIAN POPOVICH -- STOPPED BY
TO PLAY "GUITAR HERO."

08:50.890 --> 08:52.482
DUDE, THAT GAME ROCKS.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.651
YEAH, IT DOES.

08:58.730 --> 09:02.097
POP'S MY BEST FRIEND
FROM THE TEAM.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.965
I WAS THERE THE REST
OF THE NIGHT.

09:03.970 --> 09:05.369
THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE I SAW

09:05.370 --> 09:07.873
WERE THESE CHEERLEADERS
WHO DROPPED BY.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.098
THEY BROUGHT POPCORN
FOR POP.

09:10.110 --> 09:11.998
CHEERLEADERS ARE CLEVER
THAT WAY.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.477
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE IT WENT,

09:13.480 --> 09:15.846
BUT IF I LOSE
THAT SCHOLARSHIP...

09:15.850 --> 09:18.239
KURT, WE'LL FIGURE OUT
ANOTHER WAY.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.559
I GOT THE WHOLE
PELL GRANT THING WORKED OUT,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.209
AND YOUR GRADES ARE GREAT.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.654

IN SCHOOL TILL 3:00.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.996
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.060
UM...

20:08.070 --> 20:10.538
FEELS KIND OF...

20:10.540 --> 20:11.507
UH...

20:11.510 --> 20:14.479
LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE AN ART MAJOR.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.107
INTERESTED AMATEUR.

20:16.110 --> 20:19.705
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE HAVING MUSE TROUBLE.

20:19.710 --> 20:24.409
YEAH, LIKE YOUR MUSE
ISN'T YOUR MUSE ANYMORE

20:24.420 --> 20:28.151
BECAUSE SHE DUMPED YOU

20:28.160 --> 20:29.718
FOR, LIKE, A MEATHEAD.

20:29.720 --> 20:35.022
UM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK THAT'S ABOUT,

20:35.030 --> 20:37.157
BUT I'M BUSY.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.627
YEAH, ME TOO.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.769
SO LET'S CUT THE CRAP.

20:40.770 --> 20:43.500
DID YOU STEAL
KURT'S PLAYBOOK, LARRY?

20:43.510 --> 20:45.808
THERE'S SOMETHING
I CAN USE,

20:45.810 --> 20:47.778
A BOOK
FULL OF FOOTBALL PLAYS.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.977
MAYBE IF IT GOT YOUR ROMANTIC
RIVAL KICKED OFF THE TEAM.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.574
I SEE, SO HE CAN SPEND
MORE TIME WITH TRISH?

20:53.580 --> 20:56.048
GREAT THEORY.
YOU ARE CLEARLY A GENIUS.

20:56.050 --> 20:59.679
IF HE'S OFF THE TEAM,
HE LOSES HIS SCHOLARSHIP.

20:59.690 --> 21:00.816
HE'S GONE.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.708
AND TRISH
IS ALONE AND READY TO CRY

21:02.720 --> 21:06.053
ON YOUR BONY-ASS,
PAINT-SPATTERED SHOULDER.

21:06.060 --> 21:09.450
LOOK, WHOEVER YOU ARE,
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL MASTERMIND.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.928
I'M JUST A PAINTER.

21:12.770 --> 21:16.763
YEAH, WELL,
SO WAS HITLER.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.542
LET ME SEE YOUR BACKPACK.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.916
IT'S ON MY CHAIR.
WHAT'S UP?

21:27.920 --> 21:31.708
JUST HAD A LITTLE CHAT
WITH OUR FRIEND LARRY --

21:31.720 --> 21:33.984
ENORMOUS TOOL,
BY THE WAY.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.617
TRISH TOTALLY TRADED UP.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.827
UH, THANKS.
SURE.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.993
ANYWAY, EVERYTHING LARRY TOUCHES
IS SMEARED WITH OIL PAINT.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.458
HE'S GOT
MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITY.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.793
SO ALL WE NEED IS
A SINGLE SMUDGE IN THE BAG.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.861
COME ON, LARRY,
PLEASE BE GUILTY.

21:58.580 --> 22:03.813
YOU SAID POP WALKED ONTO
THE HEARST FOOTBALL TEAM, RIGHT?

22:07.790 --> 22:09.951
SO IF YOU LOST
YOUR SCHOLARSHIP,

22:09.960 --> 22:12.622
IT COULD, THEORETICALLY,
GO TO HIM?

22:12.630 --> 22:14.291
POP COULDN'T.
I MEAN, HE'S MY --

22:14.300 --> 22:17.394
THEN HOW DID IT GET IN THERE?
YOU NEVER OPENED THE BAG.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.662
HE WOULD KNOW TO TRASH IT.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.262
THERE'S NO WAY
WE WOULD PROVE IT.

22:20.270 --> 22:22.932
SO WE BLACKMAIL HIM.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF BLACKMAIL.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.067
IF I CALL HIM AND HE SHOWS,
HE'S GUILTY.

22:25.070 --> 22:28.506
GET HIM TO CONFESS ON TAPE,
WE FORCE HIM TO TAKE THE FALL.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.443
PLEASE, I'VE ONLY DONE THIS
A MILLION TIMES.

22:32.450 --> 22:35.977
SO, HOW DID PEOPLE BLACKMAIL
EACH OTHER BEFORE E-MAIL?

22:35.980 --> 22:38.210
30 YEARS AGO,
I'D BE HERE ALL NIGHT

22:38.220 --> 22:42.111
CUTTING LETTERS FROM A MAGAZINE
AND GETTING GLUE EVERYWHERE.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.657
NOW IT'S JUST ONE BUTTON.

22:44.660 --> 22:48.892
AND I'M READY FOR MY OFFICIAL
BOYFRIEND VISIT.

22:50.670 --> 22:55.164
AND LAST BUT NOT, BY NO MEANS,
LEAST, THORSTEN VEBLEN.

22:55.170 --> 22:56.364
ENJOY.

22:56.370 --> 22:58.565
[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

23:04.550 --> 23:06.074
Logan: Hey, it's me.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.241
I don't think I'll be able
to make it tonight...

23:08.250 --> 23:11.219
Man: Come on, do it.
Come on.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.780
...'cause it looks like
I'm getting lucky.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.678
See you tomorrow, babe.

23:18.660 --> 23:19.957
NOW, HERE'S A MORAL DILEMMA.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.019
YOU HAVE A CELLPHONE TRACKER

23:22.030 --> 23:24.260
WHICH COST YOUR DAD
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.022
YOU WENT THROUGH THE TROUBLE

23:26.030 --> 23:28.430
OF ACTIVATING YOUR GPS CHIP
IN YOUR BOYFRIEND'S PHONE,

23:28.440 --> 23:32.206
SO IS IT A WASTE OF YOUR DAD'S
HARD-EARNED MONEY AND YOUR TIME

23:32.210 --> 23:34.508
IF YOU DON'T USE IT?

23:38.680 --> 23:41.240
HEY, GUYS, HEY. GOOD TO SEE
YOU GUYS. HOW ARE YOU?

23:41.250 --> 23:42.979
LOOKING GOOD.
LOOKING GOOD.

23:42.980 --> 23:46.711
ANGELA, THAT IS A SHARP-LOOKING
JACKET. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.411
YO, WE'RE RUNNING
LOW ON VODKA.

23:50.420 --> 23:52.422
CAN YOU DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

23:52.430 --> 23:54.227
WHOO-HOO!
OH, NICE!

23:54.230 --> 23:57.768
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE,
EVERYBODY HAVING A GOOD TIME.

24:08.510 --> 24:09.909
AND YOU, MY FRIEND,

24:09.910 --> 24:12.777
APPEAR TO BE IN THE PROVERBIAL
CATBIRD SEAT.

24:17.220 --> 24:20.348
IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE CALLING
THE TOILET THESE DAYS?

24:21.120 --> 24:23.520
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I THINK I'M IN.

24:38.270 --> 24:39.669
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:39.670 --> 24:42.138
I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

24:42.140 --> 24:45.371
FIRST, LET'S START OUT
WITH WHERE EXACTLY HERE IS.

24:45.380 --> 24:49.168
MY ROOM. MERCER.
MERCER HAYES.

24:49.180 --> 24:50.442
JUST VERONICA.

24:50.450 --> 24:53.248
SO THIS IS
WHY YOU STOOD ME UP?

24:53.250 --> 24:55.582
ARE YOU PLAYING,
OR IS YOUR SEAT --
IT'S FREE.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.854
UNLIKE ME, APPARENTLY.

24:57.860 --> 25:00.226
VERONICA, IT'S NOT
LIKE I PROMISED.

25:00.230 --> 25:02.255
WAIT,
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

25:02.260 --> 25:05.195
I JUST FOLLOWED THE PUNGENT
SMELL OF MONEY GOING TO WASTE.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.498
SO, WHAT WAS IT,
A BUG, A TRACER?

25:07.500 --> 25:09.866
I JUST
TRACED YOUR PHONE.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.735
CAN YOU MAYBE
MOVE THIS OUTSIDE?

25:11.740 --> 25:13.139
HEY, M-M-MERCER,

25:13.140 --> 25:15.233
YOU GOT A SPREAD
ON THIS WEEKEND'S GAME?

25:15.240 --> 25:17.606
I D-D-D-DO.

25:17.610 --> 25:20.078
YOU MUST HATE
WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.514
IT'S US BY FOUR.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.784
YEAH,
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND.

25:29.590 --> 25:33.026
YOU KNOW, AS ADORABLE AS IT IS
WHEN YOU DO IT TO CRIMINALS,

25:33.030 --> 25:35.396
THE SURVEILLANCE THING
IS STARTING TO BUG.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.049
YOU SAID YOU'D COME BY.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.288
MIGHT COME BY.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.495
AND THEN ON YOUR MESSAGE
I HEARD ALL THIS PARTYING,

25:40.500 --> 25:42.263
AND I WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

25:42.270 --> 25:44.864
WHILE I APPRECIATE YOUR
INTEREST, BIG BROTHER --

25:44.870 --> 25:46.599
WOW,
A "1984" REFERENCE.

25:46.610 --> 25:49.033
DID YOU READ THAT
IN WEIGHT LIFTING?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.543
YOU KNOW,
YOUR DAD WAS HALF RIGHT.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.711
YOU HAVE A THING
FOR BAD BOYS,

25:53.720 --> 25:56.177
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO REFORM THEM.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.387
YOU JUST GET OFF
ON JUDGING THEM.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.812
WHICH REMINDS ME --

25:59.820 --> 26:02.118
CAN I BORROW YOUR COPY
OF "101 BROODING COMMENTS"?

26:02.120 --> 26:03.883
I ONLY HAVE
THE CLIFFS NOTES.

26:03.890 --> 26:07.223
LOOK, I GOT TO RUN,
SO TO SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE,

26:07.230 --> 26:09.790
I'M SURFING IN MEXICO WITH DICK
AND MERCER THIS WEEKEND.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.199
I'LL FAX YOU THE COORDINATES

26:11.200 --> 26:12.827
SO YOU DON'T INCUR
CELL-TRACKING CHARGES,

26:12.830 --> 26:14.468
AND I'LL KEEP A JOURNAL
OF MY BAD THOUGHTS

26:14.470 --> 26:17.439
IN CASE YOU WANT TO STICK
MY FACE IN A CAGE OF RATS.

26:18.210 --> 26:21.577
SORRY, "1984" IS
THE ONLY BOOK I READ.

26:29.450 --> 26:33.284
* THE MOST TENDER PLACE
IN MY HEART *

26:33.290 --> 26:37.954
* IS FOR STRANGERS *

26:37.960 --> 26:39.825
* I KNOW IT'S UNKIND *

26:39.830 --> 26:45.063
* BUT MY OWN BLOOD
IS MUCH TOO DANGEROUS *

26:46.500 --> 26:48.832
I GOT FIRED
OFF A JOB TODAY.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.263
WHAT? WHAT HAP--

26:51.270 --> 26:52.862
WEEVIL?

26:52.870 --> 26:56.829
I SENT HIM ON SURVEILLANCE
THE OTHER NIGHT.

26:56.840 --> 27:00.048
HE DID GREAT,
REALLY GREAT.

27:00.050 --> 27:03.269
I SENT HIM
ON ANOTHER ONE LAST NIGHT,

27:03.280 --> 27:04.941
A CHILD-ABUSE CASE.

27:04.950 --> 27:07.384
A COUPLE'S SON DIED IN A CRASH,
AND THEY SUSPECT

27:07.390 --> 27:09.915
THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S
HITTING THEIR GRANDSON,

27:09.920 --> 27:11.319
SO THEY WANT CUSTODY.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.888
WHAT DID HE DO?

27:12.890 --> 27:15.529
IT'S NOT THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW,
IT'S THE NEW BOYFRIEND.

27:15.530 --> 27:17.725
SO WEEVIL --
HIT THE NEW BOYFRIEND.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.266
REPEATEDLY.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.488
THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW REALIZED
WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.797
LAWYERS GOT INVOLVED,

27:22.800 --> 27:24.631
THE GRANDPARENTS
LOST THEIR CHANCE.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.198
I LOST THE JOB

27:26.210 --> 27:29.338
AND MY CHANCE TO PROTECT THE KID
FROM FURTHER ABUSE.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.001
OH, MY GOD.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.916
DAD, IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.481
HE REALLY NEEDS THE WORK.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.357
SO DO I, HONEY.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.749
HE'S GOT TO GO.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.957
[ SIGHS ]

27:50.700 --> 27:52.725
[ SIGHS ]

27:54.200 --> 27:56.395
SO, IS HE MAD?

27:56.400 --> 27:59.335
ACTUALLY...

28:00.780 --> 28:04.238
...I ASKED IF I COULD BE
THE ONE TO TALK TO YOU.

28:04.250 --> 28:08.744
HE SAID HE HAS
TO LET YOU GO.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.308
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.743
HE LIKES YOU.
HE SAID YOU'RE A GOOD --

28:12.750 --> 28:15.913
DON'T SUGARCOAT IT,
ALL RIGHT? I GET IT.

28:17.260 --> 28:20.229
I'D FIRE ME.

28:20.230 --> 28:23.154
MAN, I JUST --

28:23.160 --> 28:25.867
I REALLY DUG
THIS STUFF, YOU KNOW?

28:25.870 --> 28:28.930
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
I WAS OKAY AT IT.

28:30.340 --> 28:31.898
I'M REALLY SORRY, WEEVIL.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.468
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

28:33.470 --> 28:36.473
LISTEN, DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY ELSE
WHO'S HIRING EX-CONS,

28:36.480 --> 28:39.244
BECAUSE IF I DON'T GET
A JOB IN A WEEK,

28:39.250 --> 28:41.810
I'M GOING
BACK TO THE JOINT.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.084
I WISH I DID.

28:44.090 --> 28:48.481
BUT, ACTUALLY, IF YOU CAN STILL
BORROW TOOLS FROM YOUR UNCLE,

28:48.490 --> 28:53.450
I CAN GET YOU TWO GRAND
TO FIX THE DEAN'S CAR.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.061
CAN I CHECK THAT OUT?

29:00.070 --> 29:01.332
GUILTY CONSCIENCE, EH?

29:01.340 --> 29:03.467
NO, ACTUALLY,
SOMEBODY TOLD ME

29:03.470 --> 29:05.700
I NEEDED TO COME DOWN HERE
AND CHECK IT OUT.

29:05.710 --> 29:08.076
ME.
I LEFT YOU THE MESSAGE.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.072
YOU.
SO, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

29:11.080 --> 29:13.241
YOU SAID THAT YOU KNEW
I'D DONE SOMETHING WRONG.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.810
THAT SOUND
IN YOUR HEAD, POP,

29:15.820 --> 29:19.347
IT IS THE BEATING
OF THIS HIDEOUS HEART!

29:20.050 --> 29:23.178
BUT, SERIOUSLY, I'M GIVING YOU
THE CHANCE TO COME CLEAN.

29:23.190 --> 29:24.726
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO KURT.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.085
THERE'S NO SENSE
TRYING TO DENY IT.

29:29.260 --> 29:30.727
GOOD.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

29:30.730 --> 29:32.368
NOW WE JUST NEED
TO FIGURE OUT

29:32.370 --> 29:34.736
HOW YOU CAN SET THINGS
STRAIGHT WITH KURT.

29:34.740 --> 29:38.460
I MEAN, I ASSUME
YOU TRASHED IT, SO...

29:38.470 --> 29:39.937
NO, I'VE STILL GOT IT.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.202
YOU DO?
YEAH.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.508
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE IT TO YOU?

29:43.510 --> 29:46.809
WELL, YEAH,
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD START.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.546
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY GET
THE THIRD DEGREE.

29:51.550 --> 29:54.610
IT'S JUST
A LOUSY SOCIOLOGY ASSIGNMENT.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.783
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.
WAIT.

29:57.790 --> 30:01.226
WHEN YOU BROKE INTO KURT'S BAG,
YOU WERE STEALING HOMEWORK?

30:01.230 --> 30:02.652
I WAS BEHIND,
AND I THOUGHT

30:02.660 --> 30:05.493
IT'S NOT LIKE EITHER OF US
WOULD GET CAUGHT, SO...

30:05.500 --> 30:08.435
WHEN YOU SWIPED THIS, DID YOU
SEE A PLAYBOOK IN HIS BAG?

30:08.440 --> 30:12.308
YEAH, WHICH IS ACTUALLY AGAINST
THE RULES, BUT KURT'S COOL.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.175
AND I WAS
STEALING HIS HOMEWORK.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.603
WHAT TIME DID YOU STOP PLAYING
"GUITAR HERO" THAT NIGHT?

30:16.610 --> 30:18.043
I DON'T KNOW, 1:00-ISH?

30:18.050 --> 30:21.508
WHENEVER HIS GIRL SHOWED UP
AND KICKED ME OUT.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.919
TRISH?

30:29.320 --> 30:32.289
VERONICA! GUESS WHO JUST GOT
HIS OWN RADIO SHOW?

30:32.290 --> 30:33.621
ME.

30:33.630 --> 30:36.428
I DO FEEL LIKE YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT, THOUGH --

30:36.430 --> 30:39.365
YOU KNOW, YOU HELPING
THE BOSS'S BOYFRIEND.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.691
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU GOT THE SHOW

30:41.700 --> 30:44.737
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO MAKE TRISH REAL UNHAPPY.

30:44.740 --> 30:47.868
TRISH,
DID YOU TALK TO KURT YET?

30:47.880 --> 30:49.529
NO, WHAT'S UP?

30:54.980 --> 30:57.540
MY BOYFRIEND HAS
A WEIGHT-LIFTING CLASS,

30:57.550 --> 31:00.383
AND I WAS MEETING HIM
BY THE STADIUM, AND I SAW KURT.

31:00.390 --> 31:02.210
I THINK
HE TURNED HIMSELF IN.

31:02.220 --> 31:03.517
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK --

31:03.520 --> 31:05.556
COACH FRY HAD HIM RUNNING
THE STADIUM,

31:05.560 --> 31:07.926
YELLING LIKE A MANIAC
ABOUT HIM LOSING THE PLAYBOOK

31:07.930 --> 31:11.889
AND HOW HE'S GONNA BE RUNNING
THE STADIUM STEPS EVERY DAY.

31:11.900 --> 31:15.233
YOU WERE RIGHT, TRISH. THAT GUY
REALLY HAS IT IN FOR KURT.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.333
