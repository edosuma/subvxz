WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:04.436
<i>Erstwhile on</i> Fargo...

00:06.720 --> 00:07.915
So you think this
is the one who killed

00:08.000 --> 00:09.150
all those people
over in Bemidji?

00:09.240 --> 00:10.390
Could be.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.196
I mean,
you're saying this is all
some... some big coincidence,

00:14.280 --> 00:16.236
that suddenly we got
four victims in 24 hours,

00:16.320 --> 00:17.720
yourself included.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.156
My wife is dead
and you're harassing me.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.516
Just... leave poor
Lester alone, will you?

00:22.600 --> 00:24.831
Found this on my
windshield last week.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.998
You got bronzer on
your blackmail note.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.070
I'm taking over.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.792
<i>I ran his plates
and it turns out</i>

00:31.880 --> 00:35.191
that the car was registered
to one of your victims.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.555
30 milligrams.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.717
<i>Don't take two of these
and think you're gonna nap.</i>

00:38.800 --> 00:40.314
<i>It's basically speed.</i>

02:09.440 --> 02:10.715
It's like
a nightmare.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.952
I told you,
I know a guy.

02:14.040 --> 02:18.080
You know a guy.
A guy.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.640
Better be some
guy, Stavros.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.759
For this...

02:29.360 --> 02:31.477
we gave up everything.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.153
Gave up?
What did we have?

02:33.240 --> 02:37.519
Debts, screaming phone calls,
bill collectors at the door.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.557
At least it was warm.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.199
Shit.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.600
What?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.000
Out of gas.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.355
You bought gas.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.159
Five dollars.
It was all I had.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.840
Idiot, the boy's
gonna freeze.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.149
We can't stay here.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.356
I know.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.920
I'll think of something.
Think of what?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.674
Gasoline?
Yeah, from your
brain into the--

03:08.760 --> 03:11.400
Will you shut up?
I gotta think.

03:37.560 --> 03:38.630
Oh, hey!

03:39.400 --> 03:41.039
Here! Here!

03:43.640 --> 03:46.838
Hey! Here! Here!

03:46.920 --> 03:48.673
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.558
Hey! No, stop.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.869
Stop, wait!

03:52.840 --> 03:55.150
Come on! Come on! Stop!

04:03.160 --> 04:04.150
All right.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.390
Lord, let me
get through this.

04:08.480 --> 04:13.032
Let us find gas and...
a warm bed.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.759
Let us prosper
even in the
smallest of ways...

04:19.600 --> 04:23.276
and I will be
your humble servant
for the rest of my days.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.110
Yeah.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.910
Oh, God.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.712
Oh, my God.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.359
Oh, God, my God.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.354
Thank you, God.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.991
I can't believe
he wouldn't stop.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.318
A family vehicle.
A baby in a car.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.676
Who doesn't stop
for a baby in a car?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.836
God is real.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.474
We're gonna freeze to death

06:42.560 --> 06:45.359
because a man that hasn't
showered since the '70s

06:45.440 --> 06:47.238
couldn't be bothered
to apply the brakes.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.754
God is real.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.995
God... is real.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.510
You know...

07:08.800 --> 07:10.280
there's nothing here.

07:11.760 --> 07:15.674
No wildlife in your pipes.
Water heater's clean.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.594
Not sure how you got
blood in your shower.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.993
Are you sure it wasn't
rust? 'Cause--

07:22.080 --> 07:23.480
Listen to me.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.711
It's not like
a Band-Aid fell out.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.992
It was buckets...
literally buckets
of blood.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.794
Whoa. Like in
a horror film, huh?

07:32.880 --> 07:35.634
And with the dead dog
you mentioned, too... Uffda.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.791
Sounds like a bad day.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.997
Did you see any
signs of tampering?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.872
Tampering?

07:43.960 --> 07:45.440
Yeah.

07:45.520 --> 07:50.436
Screws loosened recently
or... holes where blood
could've been injected.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.313
Injected?

07:54.400 --> 07:56.119
What the heck
are you thinkin'
happened here?

07:56.200 --> 07:58.920
Nothing.
Thanks for your time.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.279
You know...

08:02.360 --> 08:06.240
You know, I, uh...
I seen your
commercials on TV.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.551
"July in January."

08:08.640 --> 08:11.155
You got any,
like, gift certificates?
The wife, she, uh...

08:11.240 --> 08:12.356
Get the hell
outta here.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.874
Sure. Okay.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.072
Uh, say...
you ever read
the Bible?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.436
What?

08:28.320 --> 08:29.549
The Bible...

08:29.640 --> 08:31.711
you know,
the big book?

08:31.800 --> 08:33.075
All that blood
made me think of it.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.919
You know,
Moses and the like.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.390
"And God sent
a plague of blood
upon the land."

08:39.480 --> 08:40.755
Better get
right with the Lord.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.597
You know what I'm...
What did you say?

08:44.760 --> 08:45.750
Nothing.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.233
Say it again.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.198
No...
What did you say to me?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.192
Say it again!
Boss, let him go.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.270
What did you say?

08:53.360 --> 08:56.353
Boss, he's just
a damn plumber.
Let him go!

09:02.440 --> 09:03.954
He's crazy.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.759
You're crazy!

09:51.760 --> 09:54.070
<i>Car 39, this is dispatch.
Come in.</i>

09:54.160 --> 09:56.152
Yeah. Hold your horses.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.991
<i>Car 39, this is dispatch.
Come in.</i>

10:06.280 --> 10:08.317
Yeah, this
is 3-9, over.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.631
<i>Car 39, you need to
follow up on a report,</i>

10:10.720 --> 10:14.919
<i>murdered canine
at 1301 Bird Lane.
Over.</i>

10:15.880 --> 10:19.112
Is that a...
Can you call it a
murder if it's a...

10:20.200 --> 10:22.954
Anyhoo, that's
animal control's
purview.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.635
<i>Yeah, Joe's sick.
Was supposed to
respond yesterday.</i>

10:25.720 --> 10:28.110
<i>Claimant is super PO'd.
Over.</i>

10:28.200 --> 10:30.510
Jeez. Come on,
that guy is always sick.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.637
What's he got,
the cancer? Over.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.552
<i>Yeah, leukemia. Over.</i>

10:36.400 --> 10:39.393
Jeez. That is...
That's awful. Okay.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.994
Well, uh...

10:42.120 --> 10:45.352
3-9, car 3-9 responding.
Over and out.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.390
One-two-five.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.753
One-two-seven.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.592
Okay.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.115
Oh, jeez.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.714
It's him.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.835
It's him.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.713
Freeze! Don't...

11:37.200 --> 11:40.511
Put your hands
where I can see...
where I can see 'em.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.479
I'm just on a call.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.476
Drop it.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.115
Yeah, just as
soon as I finish.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.316
This is Duluth.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.791
Package requested,
Frank Peterson.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.189
Okay, all good. See?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.509
Put it down.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.512
It's a new phone.
Now!

12:01.640 --> 12:02.710
Okay.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.516
Okay, um...

12:06.760 --> 12:10.515
turn around and put
your hands on your head.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.559
What's this all
about, Officer?

12:13.640 --> 12:15.757
You know what
this is about.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.798
Okay...

12:18.880 --> 12:23.159
put your left
hand around your, uh...
the back of your...

12:24.160 --> 12:25.150
Yeah.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.915
Okay...
now the other one...
slowly.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.673
Am I under arrest?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.919
You're handcuffed.
Of course
you're under arrest.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.559
On what charge?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.433
It, uh...

12:42.520 --> 12:44.830
We'll figure that
out at the station.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.876
Okay.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.037
All right.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.077
Back...
back to the car.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.116
All right.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.715
Butt first.
Watch your head.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.877
You're making
a mistake.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.469
Be quiet.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.440
You're making
a mistake.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.994
I said quiet.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.994
That's what you're gonna
say a couple hours from now.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.311
"You're making a mistake."

14:17.480 --> 14:19.199
Got one.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.397
What was he,
mean to a cat?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.559
Murder and car
thievery, all right.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.280
This fella's wanted
for the triple
homicide in Bemidji.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.919
Oh, now
hold on a sec.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.276
It's like I told
this young fella,

14:31.360 --> 14:33.716
this is a boondoggle,
plain and simple.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.439
Save it, Cochise.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.871
Now, I'm gonna
ink your right hand.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.680
Press each finger
individually
against the book.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.672
If you try anything...

14:43.760 --> 14:45.956
I can't promise you
fingers won't get broke.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.957
Okay, message
received, young fella.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.032
You won't get no
pushback from me.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.439
What the heck?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.429
Son of a...

15:28.520 --> 15:30.477
<i>Molly, call on two.</i>

15:30.560 --> 15:31.710
Yeah, Solverson.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.871
<i>Yeah, hey, it's Gus.</i>

15:33.960 --> 15:36.191
<i>I got him.</i>
Who's this then?

15:37.680 --> 15:40.434
Yeah, Gus Grimly.
From over Duluth.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.035
You know, we...
we had the milkshakes
the other...

15:43.120 --> 15:44.952
Oh, yeah, hey.
How's it goin'?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.440
<i>Yeah, real good.</i>

15:46.520 --> 15:47.590
Uh...

15:47.680 --> 15:53.074
So, I was on patrol earlier.
Responding to a 613 and--

15:53.160 --> 15:54.514
<i>What's that then?</i>

15:55.880 --> 15:57.633
Dead dog,
foul play suspected.

15:57.720 --> 16:02.033
And I see this fella and
he's standing by a van.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.156
And it was him.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.230
Him who?

16:04.320 --> 16:06.630
<i>The fella from
Mr. Nygaard's car.</i>

16:06.720 --> 16:07.836
The driver?

16:07.920 --> 16:11.357
Yeah, yeah, the, uh...
the one I let go.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.432
But there he was.
I mean, just, you know,

16:13.520 --> 16:15.637
just standin' there,
makin' a call on his...

16:15.720 --> 16:16.915
So what did you--

16:17.000 --> 16:18.832
I stopped and
arrested him,
of course.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.115
Arrested him?

16:20.200 --> 16:23.193
Yeah, for the murders.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.670
I'm looking at
the guy right now.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.189
The Lieutenant's gonna
have a chat with him.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.475
I thought you might wanna...

16:30.560 --> 16:33.200
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'm gettin'
in my car.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.397
<i>Great.</i>

16:35.480 --> 16:37.392
I'll be there
just as soon as I--
<i>Okay, then.</i>

16:37.480 --> 16:39.836
Yeah, I'll tell
the Lieutenant
to wait for you.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.115
Thanks.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.190
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:42.280 --> 16:43.475
<i>You're welcome.</i>

16:43.560 --> 16:46.120
Yeah, okay.
So we've been putting in
a lot of hours on the Chief,

16:46.200 --> 16:48.795
but the weather
service is trackin'
a big storm.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.032
They're looking
at Wednesday night,
Thursday, early a.m.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.396
High winds, blizzard,
the whole shebang.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.951
So if you wanna make
extra money plowing,
see Cindy.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.157
Same goes
for traffic duty,
etcetera.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.232
But I don't want this
impacting everyday doings,

17:02.320 --> 17:05.631
so don't sign up unless
your workload is cleared.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.712
Chief, they got him.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.438
Who?
Duluth PD.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.634
No, who'd they get?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.192
Oh. Yeah.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.271
Fella driving
Lester's stolen car.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.079
Deputy pulled
him in an hour ago.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.310
How come
they called you?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.356
Pardon?

17:23.440 --> 17:26.751
You're not even on the case.
How come they called you?

17:26.839 --> 17:27.829
I just...

17:27.920 --> 17:30.799
Well, the other day,
a deputy drove
down from Duluth.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.476
And... you know,
he and I talked is all.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.029
Well, that's irregular.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.913
They should talk to
the officer in charge.

17:39.000 --> 17:39.990
Yeah.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.600
Yeah, so I was thinking
I'd drive up there.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.240
You know, talk to the
suspect. On account of,
you know--

17:44.320 --> 17:46.630
I think he's the fella
who put the naked
guy in the trunk.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.632
No, should be me.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.235
You said he was
driving Lester's car.
That's my case.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.800
Plus, Vern
takes precedence.

17:52.880 --> 17:53.870
Okay, but Chief--

17:53.960 --> 17:55.599
Knutson, you're in
charge till I get back.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.677
Okie-dokie, Chief. 10-4.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.714
Gotta
pick up a few things.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.314
You could've
waited in the car.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.754
No, Kitty said
I should--

18:14.840 --> 18:16.957
I mean, I wanna be
here for you, so--

18:17.040 --> 18:18.838
Oh, jeez.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.872
They just...
they leave it
like that?

18:27.800 --> 18:29.029
All the blood.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.191
Yeah, it's, uh...

18:31.280 --> 18:34.796
You know, they gave me
a number to call, a service.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.795
Lester--

18:39.880 --> 18:40.916
I gotta...

19:00.960 --> 19:02.553
Oh, yeah...
oh, my...

19:12.320 --> 19:17.679
No, no, no. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.230
What?

19:30.080 --> 19:33.073
God... damn it.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.754
Oh, my God.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.960
Oh, my God.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.274
Hello?

20:06.400 --> 20:07.959
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

20:09.960 --> 20:11.314
Who is this?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.312
<i>The widow Hess.</i>

20:14.440 --> 20:17.000
<i>Her husband nice and
cozy in the ground.</i>

20:17.080 --> 20:19.037
<i>Insurance money
on the way.</i>

20:19.120 --> 20:22.636
<i>And every night she puts
her kitty in your face.</i>

20:22.720 --> 20:26.919
<i>A guy like you, Lester...
small town, small time...</i>

20:27.000 --> 20:29.515
<i>might think you
won the lottery.</i>

20:29.600 --> 20:33.389
<i>But I think that
you need to ask yourself...</i>

20:33.480 --> 20:35.073
<i>was it worth it?</i>

20:37.000 --> 20:37.990
Worth what?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.196
<i>Your life.</i>

21:32.880 --> 21:33.950
Freshen you up?
No, we're good.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.190
Just the check
please. Thanks.

21:38.680 --> 21:39.830
Everything okay?

21:39.920 --> 21:41.957
He's just not
very hungry. Thanks.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.030
Thanks.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.195
For Christ's
sakes, man!

22:34.440 --> 22:35.760
Seriously?

23:07.200 --> 23:10.637
I'm not looking at you.
I'm not looking at you.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.400
You got
two minutes.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.392
Okie-dokie.
Thanks a lot, sir.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.793
Sir...

23:49.160 --> 23:50.480
are you Don Chumph?

23:52.520 --> 23:53.840
Uh...

23:53.920 --> 23:54.910
Yeah.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.434
There's a phone
call for you.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.874
A what now?

23:57.960 --> 23:58.950
Telephone.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.151
You can take it right
here at the counter.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.358
Hello?
<i>Do they have 'em?</i>

24:09.200 --> 24:10.190
Who is this?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.434
Well, let's figure
this out together.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.273
Who knows you're
at the pet store
right now?

24:14.360 --> 24:15.999
My mom?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.991
Do I sound
like your mom?
<i>Uh...</i>

24:20.080 --> 24:21.070
No.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.116
<i>Hold on.</i>

24:22.200 --> 24:24.556
Does your mom know
why you're at the
pet store right now?

24:24.640 --> 24:27.280
She thinks
I'm getting a cat.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.551
Okay,
I don't have
time for this.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.791
Do they have 'em?
Yes or no.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.951
Yeah, but only 100.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.030
<i>Okay.</i>

24:35.160 --> 24:38.676
Well, there are
three other pet stores
in the city, so hit 'em all.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.752
I'm in jail.
I'll be out
in a few hours.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.160
Wait-- What?

24:42.240 --> 24:43.560
Time is up.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.397
In two hours.
Come get me.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.474
And this is the deputy
who effected the arrest.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.279
Yeah, nice
work there.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.635
He give you
much of a fight?

24:56.720 --> 24:58.279
Uh... No, sir.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.750
Bill Oswalt's
the Chief over
at Bemidji.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.830
Oh.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.359
Molly come?

25:05.480 --> 25:06.470
Who?

25:06.560 --> 25:08.597
Deputy over
at my office.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.673
Sounds like your man's
got a thing for her.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.470
Lock that shit down, Grimly.
This is a murder case.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.789
Yes, sir.

25:16.880 --> 25:17.836
So we got a name
on the guy?

25:17.920 --> 25:18.910
Yes, sir.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.552
Driver's license says
Frank Peterson and
an address up in Baudette.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.714
Peterson, eh?

25:26.920 --> 25:30.391
I knew a
Jay Peterson once...
had a dwarf arm.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.236
What about evidence?

25:34.320 --> 25:35.390
Sir?

25:35.480 --> 25:37.392
Proof of his
connection to the crime.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.870
You say you stopped him
driving Lester's car?

25:39.960 --> 25:42.111
Yes, sir, but I didn't
know that it was stolen.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.192
Why I let him go.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.954
Yeah, but you
pulled prints from
the impounded vehicle?

25:47.040 --> 25:49.430
No, sir.
Techs said it
was wiped clean.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.719
Yeah.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.314
Well,
we got a photo
though, right?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.312
I mean, dashboard camera
from the car stop?

25:55.400 --> 25:56.880
You know, proof
he's our guy.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.714
No, sir.
My camera hasn't
worked for weeks.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.235
But Molly's
got a picture.
It's in the file.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.720
She showed me.
Yeah.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.519
She did?
Yeah.

26:10.000 --> 26:10.990
Yeah.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.713
Yeah, this fella.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.190
It's kind of
hard to see though.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.680
It's grainy.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.755
You sure this
is our guy?

26:22.840 --> 26:26.880
Yeah, yeah, no--
That's our guy.
I'm positive.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.998
Yeah, I'm Lieutenant Schmidt.

26:41.120 --> 26:44.431
This is Bill Oswalt,
Chief over at Bemidji.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.433
Yeah, Frank Peterson.
I'm the minister
up in Baudette.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.318
Go Bears.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.716
A minister?

26:54.680 --> 26:58.276
Yeah, Baudette Lutheran.
Six years now.
Frank Peterson.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.113
Before that Aberdeen.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.671
So, you know, I'm not
used to having a firearm
stuck in my face,

27:03.760 --> 27:05.479
which I know
the Lord tests you
in all kinds of ways,

27:05.600 --> 27:08.160
but... ooh, partner,
that's a heart-stopper.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.310
Cut the shit.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.791
You were pulled
over Tuesday night
driving a stolen car.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.952
No, sir. I think
I'd remember that.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.475
Plus, Tuesday is bingo
night at the church.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.074
We had a full house.

27:26.160 --> 27:31.394
Florence Nightgarden
won the entire pot...
if I'm not mistaken.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.631
And we can
check on that?

27:33.720 --> 27:36.997
Oh, sure, yes, sir.
You could call
Florence herself.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.311
Or Jim Avery,
he's our alderman.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.150
Deputy Grimly--

27:41.240 --> 27:44.039
Oh, that's the fella.
Deputy Grimly...

27:44.120 --> 27:46.316
Pulled his pistol,
pointed it right at me.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.154
Thought I was gonna
have a heart attack.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.594
But, you know,
after he told me

27:50.680 --> 27:52.319
about those homicides
over at Bemidji,

27:52.440 --> 27:54.397
I thought, "Frank,
I mean, you can't blame

27:54.480 --> 27:56.039
"the guy for
being a little jumpy.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.395
"A horror show like that."

27:58.280 --> 27:59.999
That son
of a bitch!

28:01.760 --> 28:04.195
<i>So you're saying you weren't
in Bemidji last week?</i>

28:04.280 --> 28:07.512
<i>If I show your picture around,
no one would recognize you?</i>

28:07.600 --> 28:08.670
<i>Me? No, sir.</i>

28:08.760 --> 28:10.319
I have a cousin
who lived in Bemidji

28:10.400 --> 28:12.392
back in the '90s,
out near Leech Lake.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.279
But he moved to
Anchorage in '03.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.513
I said, "What, Minnesota's
not cold enough for you?"

28:19.600 --> 28:21.876
We had a good
laugh about that.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.351
Also, you're saying
you weren't pulled
over for speeding?

28:25.440 --> 28:26.430
No, sir.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.876
I'm a cautious
driver by nature...

28:28.960 --> 28:30.713
on account
of my eyesight.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.634
Glaucoma they say it is,
only in the one eye.

28:33.720 --> 28:34.870
But you can't
be too careful.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.475
That's what I tell
my parishioners.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.040
Deputy Grimly--
Forgiveness,

28:39.120 --> 28:40.873
that's the heart
of the good book.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.078
Turn the other cheek,
second chances. Amen.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.874
So, no, I don't
hold a grudge
against the deputy.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.634
Though I'm lucky
I had my nitroglycerin
pills with me,

28:49.720 --> 28:51.791
I'll tell you. Uffda.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.833
Okay. Well, sit tight.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.230
We're gonna
make some calls,
check your story.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.074
You just...
just pick a name
out of the phone book.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.310
Everybody up there
knows me.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.550
Yeah.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.389
So, uh...
looks like a call
was placed

29:30.480 --> 29:32.073
to your motel from
the victim's house

29:32.160 --> 29:34.277
the night Pearl
Nygaard was killed.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.397
You said that
on the phone.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.755
Right.

29:37.880 --> 29:41.954
So... you remember
any seedy types
checking in last week?

29:42.040 --> 29:43.872
Possible...
with a head injury?

29:43.960 --> 29:45.440
I thought on it
on the way over.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.480
There was a fella
checked in around then,
had a bump on his head.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.432
Gave me guff
when I asked him
if he had any pets.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.960
Oh, yeah?

29:53.040 --> 29:54.997
Is it... this fella maybe?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.116
Yeah.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.192
That's him.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.594
You don't sound
too happy about it.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.559
Well, he just
wasn't very
nice is all.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.871
I brought my book,
like you asked.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.360
Fella paid cash,
I think.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.239
But I make everyone
put their name
in the ledger.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.276
There you go.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.670
Okay, yeah.

30:24.360 --> 30:28.479
Say... you remember
finding anything odd
when you cleaned his room?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.074
What do you
mean "odd"?

30:30.160 --> 30:33.471
Like...
out of the ordinary.
Memorable, I guess.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.593
Well, he had
some tokens from
over the Lucky Penny.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.149
You don't say.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.799
Okay.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.076
All right. Thank you.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.354
All right, then.
Well, it looks like

30:48.440 --> 30:51.558
he's a pretty
well-respected member
of the community up there.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.519
We just had to
call and verify.
Thanks for your time.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.716
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:03.160 --> 31:04.150
Grimly.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.197
<i>Where have
you been? I've been trying
to call you all day.</i>

31:06.280 --> 31:07.270
Thought you were comin'.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.239
Tried.
Are you in the room?

31:11.000 --> 31:12.400
Yeah, they just
talked to him.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.880
<i>Why not you?</i>

31:13.960 --> 31:16.794
Me? No,
I do animal control
mostly.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.271
<i>Listen, I got a name
for the suspect.</i>

31:20.360 --> 31:23.478
Lorne Malvo.
He used it to
check into a motel.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.713
Lorne Malvo, huh?

31:27.040 --> 31:28.474
They're.. they're comin'
out. I'll call you back.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.392
Sorry again for the
confusion, Pastor.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.597
Just glad
nobody got hurt.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.796
You're lettin' him go?

31:38.880 --> 31:40.234
Desk duty, two weeks.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.073
Now, just a--
Three weeks.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.719
For Pete--

31:43.800 --> 31:45.473
You're making a mistake.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.320
Grimly, with me now.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.197
You pointed
your service weapon
at a civilian.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.511
No, a damn minister
on a public street.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.432
No evidence,
no fingerprints, nothin'.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.874
What about
the picture?

32:07.960 --> 32:09.633
What, that Zapruder
film in the file?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.757
Hell, son, that could
be a photo of my
momma for all I know.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.910
No, no, it's him.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.514
I know it's him.
Negatory.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.273
We checked his story.
It tracks.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.158
He's lying!

32:35.560 --> 32:36.960
You have
a blessed day.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.520
How can you do that?

32:50.800 --> 32:52.359
What's that, son?

32:53.080 --> 32:55.390
Just... just lie
like that.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.194
I sure hope you
catch that fella

32:59.280 --> 33:00.760
who killed all
those people.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.230
I'll be praying on it.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.598
Lorne Malvo.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.993
Did you know
the human eye can see

33:21.080 --> 33:24.118
more shades of green
than any other color?

33:28.560 --> 33:29.914
What?

33:30.000 --> 33:31.832
I said did you know
that the human eye can see

33:31.920 --> 33:34.719
more shades of green
than any other color?

33:36.320 --> 33:39.358
My question
for you is why?

33:39.440 --> 33:42.194
Now just hold on.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.273
When you figure out
the answer to my question...

33:46.760 --> 33:48.877
then you'll have
the answer to yours.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.520
Where are they?

34:12.600 --> 34:13.590
In the back.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.797
Can't you hear?
It's driving me crazy.

34:22.719 --> 34:24.473
Yeah?
<i>Yeah, Mr. Nygaard?</i>

34:24.560 --> 34:25.710
<i>This is Dave
from Duluth impound.</i>

34:25.800 --> 34:28.156
Yeah, I'm gonna pick
her up probably Friday.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.914
<i>No, sir, I'm supposed
to tell you your
car's not ready yet.</i>

34:31.000 --> 34:31.956
What do you mean?

34:32.040 --> 34:34.077
<i>It's... Forensic
team's lookin' at it.</i>

34:34.159 --> 34:35.879
Forensic?
<i>Yes, sir. Just routine,</i>

34:35.960 --> 34:37.917
<i>but I can't
release the car to you
till they release it to me.</i>

34:38.000 --> 34:40.639
<i>So, I'll call you
when it's done, okay?
Bye, now.</i>

34:40.719 --> 34:41.790
Hey, Lester.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.160
I'm in a meeting.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.356
<i>Chaz?</i>

35:27.360 --> 35:28.794
I said I'm in a meeting.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.200
Chaz, it's...
it's Lester.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.954
Look, I think I might be
in a bit of trouble here.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.793
When are you not in...

35:34.880 --> 35:36.234
What kind of trouble?

35:36.360 --> 35:37.635
<i>Well, I'm...</i>

35:37.720 --> 35:38.949
<i>I'm in the trunk of a car.</i>

35:39.040 --> 35:40.030
What?

35:40.120 --> 35:42.954
A car. In...
in the trunk.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.149
<i>You're in
the trunk of your car?</i>

35:45.240 --> 35:47.880
No, not my car. It's...
it's these two fellas.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.316
You see, the thing...

35:50.400 --> 35:53.438
I think I may
have been kidnapped
is the thing.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.318
<i>What?</i>
Yeah.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.551
They got me...
in the trunk.

35:57.720 --> 35:58.756
Uh-huh.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.514
I... I don't really
know where we're goin'.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.398
Did you say
you got kidnapped?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.440
<i>Lester, where are you?</i>

36:07.560 --> 36:08.516
I'll call the cops.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.752
No, no, no. Don't...
don't call the...

36:12.840 --> 36:16.117
Yeah, it's just a...

36:16.200 --> 36:17.350
I'm prankin' you.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.159
What?
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:19.280 --> 36:23.320
<i>Remember, how we
used to... You know,
practical jokes and all.</i>

36:23.400 --> 36:25.631
<i>Well... you're it!</i>

36:25.720 --> 36:27.393
You're an asshole.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.840
Come on. Come on.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.199
There you go.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.119
Come on.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.475
Let's go.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.597
You're gonna say it.

37:35.680 --> 37:40.072
"I, Lester Nygaard..."
You're gonna say it.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.470
"I, Lester Nygaard..."

37:43.720 --> 37:46.280
I, Lester Nygaard...

37:47.280 --> 37:48.270
Louder.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.799
Louder!
I, Lester Nygaard...

37:50.920 --> 37:53.037
"Killed..."
No. No, you see,
I did not kill--

37:53.120 --> 37:56.318
Lester, you're gonna say it.
One way or the other.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.914
Okay, all right?
Mmm-hmm.

37:58.000 --> 37:58.990
"Killed Sam Hess."

37:59.080 --> 38:00.070
That's not true.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.116
I didn't kill him.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.190
Yes, you did.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.034
No, I didn't.
Okay, then who was it?

38:05.120 --> 38:06.998
It was a man.
Who's the man?

38:07.080 --> 38:08.116
The man...

38:08.200 --> 38:11.876
Who? Who's him?
Who... who is him?

38:11.960 --> 38:13.440
It was the guy--

38:13.560 --> 38:15.472
What? Who? What guy?

38:17.320 --> 38:18.640
The guy...

39:24.520 --> 39:27.035
I need... I need...

39:27.120 --> 39:28.998
Is this your car, sir?
What?

39:29.080 --> 39:30.594
Is this your car?

39:30.720 --> 39:32.154
No, no.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.392
I need... a ride back to town.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.551
Not a taxi
service, sir.
What?

39:37.640 --> 39:40.235
I said we're not a taxi...
Please, I just...
I just need...

39:41.040 --> 39:43.032
Just give me a damn ride!

39:43.560 --> 39:44.630
Oh!

39:45.320 --> 39:47.073
Heck, sir.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.312
Now I gotta arrest you.
Good, good. Let's go.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.631
Oh, jeez! Thanks.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.310
Okay.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.830
Jeez.

40:14.720 --> 40:17.713
Yeah, this is car 3108.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.234
Coming in with a 313.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.470
<i>Copy, 3108.</i>

40:20.560 --> 40:22.870
Yeah, guy punched me.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.231
Knock, for Christ's sake.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.754
How many times?

41:48.600 --> 41:50.080
Not now.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.435
Not now!

41:54.040 --> 41:56.077
Look, I wanna
talk about Mom.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.475
I said not now.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.358
You're not
being very nice.

41:59.440 --> 42:00.715
"Nice"?

42:00.800 --> 42:01.916
You think you
go down to the
car dealership

42:02.040 --> 42:03.793
and buy
a car with "nice"?

42:03.880 --> 42:07.112
You think the girls
at the titty bar
care about "nice"?

42:07.200 --> 42:09.317
It's kill or
be killed, son.

42:17.600 --> 42:18.795
Are you crying?

42:19.520 --> 42:21.034
No.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.396
Don't.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.273
Kill or be killed.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.357
Help, get it off!
Get it off of me!

43:22.200 --> 43:24.840
Dad, what's happening?

43:29.680 --> 43:30.670
God!

43:40.280 --> 43:43.159
<i>We demand one million
in unmarked bills.</i>

43:43.240 --> 43:46.438
<i>We'll call
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
with the drop instructions.</i>

43:46.560 --> 43:47.880
<i>Do you understand?</i>

43:50.080 --> 43:51.070
Yeah.

43:51.160 --> 43:54.073
<i>Remember,
God is watching.</i>

43:54.160 --> 43:55.719
Was that him?

44:06.920 --> 44:08.673
God is real.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.400
Bartender...

44:30.600 --> 44:36.073
I tend... to have a beer
and then a little tequila guy.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.669
Looks like you
already had a few.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.991
Well, then, they're
working. Right?

44:46.640 --> 44:47.869
What are you lookin' at?

44:54.800 --> 44:56.632
You know,
I'll tell you something.

45:04.080 --> 45:07.517
I will put... your eye out!

45:07.640 --> 45:09.154
What?

45:45.000 --> 45:47.037
I was about to
send a search party.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.918
Yeah, sorry.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.118
Cindy said Bill's
on his way back.
What happened?

45:52.200 --> 45:56.592
Well... they let
him go. Malvo.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.717
Yeah, he had an alibi.
It checked out.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.076
But... it's him.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.833
How do you know?

46:02.920 --> 46:04.559
'Cause I said the name,
Lorne Malvo,

46:04.640 --> 46:07.872
and he stopped
and he looked
at me real funny.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.031
And then he said,
like, a riddle.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.799
What's that
about a riddle?

46:11.880 --> 46:16.272
Like... how come
the human eye can see

46:16.360 --> 46:18.431
more shades of green
than any other color?

46:20.120 --> 46:21.156
'Cause of predators.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.191
Used to be we
were monkeys, right?

46:27.280 --> 46:29.476
And in the woods,
in the jungle,
everything's green.

46:29.560 --> 46:32.439
So, in order to not
get eaten by panthers
and bears and the like,

46:32.560 --> 46:35.997
we had to be able
to see them, you know,
grass and trees and such.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.390
Predators.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.439
So what do we do now?

46:50.760 --> 46:52.194
Lester.

47:15.720 --> 47:18.235
Can I get, like,
a phone call?
And a...

47:19.640 --> 47:21.313
and a chicken pot pie?

47:23.280 --> 47:25.158
Sleep it off,
rummies.
