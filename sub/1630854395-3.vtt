00:07.048 --> 00:09.634
- So many cute hats.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.969
Oh, excuse me. Señor?

00:11.011 --> 00:12.846
Do you have this hat
in that color

00:12.887 --> 00:15.140
with that band, those sequins,
that feather,

00:15.181 --> 00:16.599
ooh, and this stitching?

00:30.905 --> 00:32.073
- What did he say?

00:32.115 --> 00:33.658
- I don't know.
I don't speak Spanish.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.496
- But you just
responded like you do.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.623
- Yeah, there's words
I use to fool people

00:40.665 --> 00:43.835
into thinking I speak it,
like <i>"claro que sí"</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:45.462
or <i>"claro"</i>or <i>"sí."</i>

00:45.503 --> 00:47.464
- So you know three words?

00:47.505 --> 00:51.509
- Oh, I also get
away with, <i>"Qué?</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:52.886
<i>Ay, no!"</i>

00:52.927 --> 00:54.679
Also, <i>"Está bien, está bien."</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:58.183
- [laughs] Why are you
pretending to speak Spanish?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.392
You know, I shouldn't judge.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.894
I pretended to be
French, British,

01:00.935 --> 01:03.480
and the fourth member
of Destiny's Child.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.984
- Because if you're Latinx
and don't speak Spanish,

01:08.026 --> 01:09.277
you get shamed for it.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.196
My dad did it to me
all the time as a kid,

01:11.237 --> 01:12.572
which is why I told him

01:12.614 --> 01:14.657
I became fluent during
the years we didn't speak.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.659
- So <i>"claro que sí"</i>
works on him, too?

01:16.701 --> 01:19.454
<i>- Claro que sí!</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:21.206
It's been tricky
since he's moved in,

01:21.247 --> 01:23.166
but my mom and Quinten
help cover for me.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.418
- So how are we supposed
to know what he said?

01:25.460 --> 01:28.755
- He said pick a hat,
or he's going to die.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.550
- Chance has been practicing
his Spanish with his dad.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.469
- Okay.
I'll take this one.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.680
Chance, can you ask the man
if he takes Venmo?

01:36.721 --> 01:40.016
- That's going to be
a no from me.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.310
- What? That's new.
How come?

01:42.352 --> 01:45.188
- If you don't speak Spanish,
why do I have to?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.107
- Yes!
Drag her!

01:47.148 --> 01:48.692
[laughs]

01:48.733 --> 01:51.111
Sorry.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.795
- Do a cheers with me,
my beautiful daughter

02:08.837 --> 02:10.672
and the maybe daddy.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.845
- I know he's Chance's dad
more than I know you're mine.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.558
- And I know I'm Chance's dad
'cause my pull-out game weak.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.439
- I got a tip for that.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.024
You get a rubber band,
you tie it in a knot,

02:29.065 --> 02:30.692
and before you get into bed,

02:30.734 --> 02:34.195
you never have sex
with my daughter again.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.655
- What are we toasting to?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.658
- I got a big move--
a rich guy with rich friends.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.120
And if this goes well, I'll be
moving a lot of fancy houses

02:42.162 --> 02:44.372
and a lot of secret apartments.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.334
- Mayan told me
your secret apartment

02:47.375 --> 02:50.253
was the back
of your '74 El Camino.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.426
- It's more romantic
to cheat under the stars.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.681
But this is huge for me
'cause I'm double-booked

03:01.723 --> 03:03.558
and I only got enough guys
for one move.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.268
- Oh, well, Quinten and I have
the weekend free.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.020
We can help you.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.855
- I'm sor--We could?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.149
- The faster he gets
back on his feet,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.692
the faster
he's out of the house.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.195
- Yes. We would love
to help you.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.529
- That's great.
- Cheers.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.031
- And if you're injured
on the site,

03:18.073 --> 03:20.325
it's no fault of Lop-EZ Movers

03:20.367 --> 03:22.702
or its subsidiaries,
Lop-EZ Dental,

03:22.744 --> 03:24.954
ipso "fatso," I rest my case.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.084
- He pulls out Oscar's
dead tooth with some pliers,

03:29.125 --> 03:31.044
thinks he's a dentist.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.380
- Unlike your boy, Quinten,

03:33.421 --> 03:36.424
my pull-out game is strong.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.344
- Guess who had fun
at the museum.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.388
- The hearing impaired.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.892
- Look, I ate Cookie Monster.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.436
Now that fool knows
how cookies feel.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.566
- Mom, we said no
artificial sweets for Chance.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.277
Nothing natural turns
your tongue that color.

03:56.319 --> 04:00.240
- Then why do they sell it
at the Natural History Museum?

04:00.281 --> 04:02.033
<i>Ay,</i>don't worry.
Relax.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.078
He ate all his apple slices
from his Happy Meal.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.579
- Then Grandma gave me

04:06.621 --> 04:09.040
two of her coffee creamers
for dessert.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.877
- We shouldn't be spoiling him
like this.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.212
It's too much.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.548
- You don't got to worry
about what me and Nana do.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.761
- See, he's got an attitude.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.097
The other day he refused
to practice his Spanish.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.433
- Uh, Chance, real Latinos
speaks Spanish.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.600
If you don't speak Spanish,

04:27.642 --> 04:30.437
you don't deserve
the Lopez last name.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.648
- Great. I'm more
of a one-name guy like Drake.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.028
- Yeah, you're more
like Chance the Crapper.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.741
Go to your room.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.242
- We do a lesson every night,

04:44.284 --> 04:46.911
but lately he has been refusing
to practice with me, too.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.330
- Mayan, you should be in
charge of the Spanish lessons.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.082
I don't want my grandson
learning Spanish

04:51.124 --> 04:53.335
from Duo-Gringo.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.505
- I-I would, but...

05:02.010 --> 05:03.636
- You would, but what?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.180
- But, uh, Mayan works late,

05:05.221 --> 05:07.807
and Quinten has more free time
to practice with him.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.934
- Yeah.
Plus, I am a proud speaker

05:09.976 --> 05:11.144
and a cultural ally.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.645
You could even say

05:12.687 --> 05:14.856
that I am a bit
of a Latinx-pert.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.361
- No.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.945
- Okay, my lady and my son
are both Latinx,

05:20.987 --> 05:23.073
so I think that gives me--
- No.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.118
- Perhaps if I said it
in <i>español?</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:28.995
- No.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.248
- As long as teaching Chance
Spanish is a priority,

05:32.290 --> 05:35.043
I'm glad Mayan learned to speak
over these last few years.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.337
<i>Eres pura Lopez, Mayan.</i>

05:37.379 --> 05:39.839
<i>- Claro que sí.</i>

05:39.881 --> 05:42.467
- Man, now you got me craving
those little coffee creamers.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.427
Rosie, is your purse
in the living room?

05:46.888 --> 05:48.014
- [whispering]
That was a close one.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.599
<i>- Ay,</i>you should
just tell him.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.893
Why are you trying to impress
a back-alley dentist?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.271
- You heard what he said.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.775
If I don't speak Spanish,
I don't deserve the Lopez name.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.527
- Well, you could always take
my last name?

06:00.568 --> 06:03.738
- I will never be
Mayan Van Bryan.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.575
- This all
could have been avoided

06:07.617 --> 06:09.411
if you had just taught me
when I was little.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.122
Why didn't you?
- I wanted to spare you.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.542
My father forced me to speak
Spanish, and I hated it.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.835
He said if I didn't speak it,

06:16.876 --> 06:18.586
Castro would come
through the mirror

06:18.628 --> 06:21.589
and grab me
and bring me back to Cuba.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.800
- Oh, but it's fine
if Castro gets me?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.887
- Okay, fine.
I will make it up to you.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.724
I will teach Chance
to speak Spanish.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.976
- The key is to make it fun.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.769
There is an old ranchera

06:34.811 --> 06:36.813
that I've been teaching him
that goes...

06:36.855 --> 06:39.232

<i>Cállate ya.</i>

06:43.570 --> 06:45.864
I do not need advice.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.074
I got this.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.743
- Good luck.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.579
Chance plays you
more than he plays "Minecraft."

06:52.620 --> 06:56.458
- Ha! I can be strict
if I need to be.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.418
- Nana, can you make me
an ice-water?

06:58.460 --> 07:01.629
It tastes better
when you make it.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.757
- Of course, <i>mi niño hermoso.</i>

07:05.633 --> 07:08.219
What? It does taste better

07:08.261 --> 07:09.637
I put a little sugar in it.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.982
If you break something,
go full Shaggy.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.860
- What's full Shaggy?

he can write a lot of reviews.

Reminds me of me.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.537
But they speak English,
too, right?

08:15.578 --> 08:19.124
- No, the only thing they know
in English is "it wasn't me."

08:21.418 --> 08:24.462
[cell phone chimes]

08:24.504 --> 08:26.172

the other movers

08:28.341 --> 08:29.968
I'm going to take Quinten

08:30.010 --> 08:31.344
You stay here, Mayan.
- Oh, no, well,

why don't I go with you
and Quinten stay behind?

08:34.305 --> 08:36.266

Mayan--you can't get hurt.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.269
You make more money
than the both of us.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.271
- Uh, but--but Mayan's, uh,
upper-body strength

08:41.312 --> 08:43.440

- Yep.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.326
Keep Raul and Mando

08:55.368 --> 08:56.828
This means a lot to me.

you can help people understand

It's like having a superpower.

- And look what happened

11:49.459 --> 11:50.627
- Nice toys.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.712
- Uh, uh, uh,
toys are for children.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.216
These are collectibles.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.592
- Even this gum?

11:57.634 --> 11:59.636
- Oh, oh, that is a vintage

11:59.678 --> 12:03.056
1970 Super Bazooka
spearmint bubblegum.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.767
- So should we
bubble-wrap them?

12:08.645 --> 12:09.979
Okay, we'll be careful.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.856
- I prefer you not touch them
at all.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.775
I'll handle it.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.444
Oh, all my ex-wives claim
I love my collectibles

12:16.486 --> 12:17.529
more than them.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.906
[laughs] It's true.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.706
- I bet they prefer
their toys, too.

12:44.514 --> 12:48.518

Uh, stop, <i>por favor.</i>

14:01.716 --> 14:03.718
- No, I'm tired.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.346
I should really lie down
and watch "Ninja Turtles."

14:06.388 --> 14:09.891
But I wouldn't hate it
if dessert showed up.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.520
<i>- No, señor.</i>

If you're not
even going to try,

14:14.979 --> 14:16.648
then you don't get to watch
what you want.

14:16.690 --> 14:21.361
I am going to watch
my <i>novela en español.</i>

14:21.403 --> 14:26.157
- Fine. I'm going to play
with my toys in English!

Who's that guy
with an eye patch?

14:32.747 --> 14:34.040
- Oh, that's Don Julio.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.834
He lost his eye
when he fell into a sewer

14:35.875 --> 14:37.585
and a rat chewed it off.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.004
- Wow!

14:39.045 --> 14:42.799
That sounds a lot
like "Ninja Turtles."

14:42.841 --> 14:46.720
- Oh, no, it's more interesting
than turtle ninjas.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.597
Someone gets slapped
in every episode.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.599
And one of them
is named Rafael,

14:51.641 --> 14:54.644
who has an evil twin
also named Rafael.

14:55.937 --> 14:59.315
- How do they tell them apart?
- They can't.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.486
- [gasps] I want to watch.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.014

Why don't you just tell them
to build a wall, too?

15:34.642 --> 15:36.686
- I know.
I feel terrible.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.937
- Who pretends to be fluent
in Spanish?

15:37.979 --> 15:39.522
I mean, why would you do that?

15:39.564 --> 15:42.859
- Because I knew you'd make fun
of me if you knew I wasn't.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.987
- Of course I would, gringa.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.740
- There it is.
It's not cool to shame me, Dad.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.200
Just because
I don't speak Spanish

15:50.241 --> 15:52.243
doesn't mean I'm not
a real Lopez.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.453
- Yes, it does.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.662
Real Latinos know the language,

15:54.704 --> 15:56.289
and you're lazy
for not learning it.

15:56.331 --> 16:00.293
You're like Dora that--
that, uh, doesn't explor-a.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.256
- You're the lazy one
for not teaching me as a kid.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.675
If you had,

16:06.716 --> 16:08.301
I would have been able
to communicate with the guys.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.261
They said something
about a podcast.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.888
I love podcasts.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.057
- Mayan, you're the one
that delayed us for hours.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.726
You insulted my employees, and
now you're putting it on me.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.478
I should have never
let you help me.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.148

out of the hole.

You want to learn some Spanish?

the hand rockets.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.273

Could you please get
your employees under control?

17:11.948 --> 17:13.867

Did you say his employees?

17:13.908 --> 17:15.452
- Yes, why?

17:15.493 --> 17:17.412
- Because I'm the boss.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.457
- Yeah, and I'm the muscle.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.292
No, you got this.

- He's not
automatically in charge

17:26.755 --> 17:28.381
just because he's white.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.717
- I'm sorry.
It was a misunderstanding.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.510
- It was a racist assumption.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.513
- Well, I mean,
I-I-I don't know that race--

17:35.555 --> 17:37.057
- You want to make
this awkward moment go away?

17:37.098 --> 17:38.475
- More than anything.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.019
- Why don't we forget
what happened,

17:41.061 --> 17:45.106
as long as you forget how
your collectible was broken?

17:45.148 --> 17:46.733
- Deal.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.778
Thank you
for not calling it a toy.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.462
- I'm sorry I called you
an orange, Dad.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.966
- It's not that you called me
an orange, Mayan.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.636
It's the way
that you called me an orange.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.722
- I'm just frustrated.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.683
I wish I had the time
to learn Spanish,

18:19.724 --> 18:21.476
but I'm a working mom.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.978
It's tough, you know.
- Yeah, I do know.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.939
Because when you were little,
I was working all the time,

18:25.980 --> 18:27.899
and your mom didn't force you,
so it didn't happen.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.443
- But I don't feel
like I can be a proud Latina

Latinx-plaining

18:55.969 --> 18:59.597
and AOC yourself out
of this conversation?

for a drink,

19:01.641 --> 19:04.853
so I'll go warm up my sake.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.772
- When I was growing up, Mayan,
there was no Bad Bunny.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.652
There was pressure
to blend in, you know.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.112
My grandmother didn't want me
to be in the sun

19:14.154 --> 19:16.823
'cause she didn't want me
to get too dark.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.909
One year I spent the whole
summer inside as a blonde.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.454
- Oh, I saw those pictures.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.622
You looked
like a Mexican Ken doll--

19:24.664 --> 19:26.249
a Mexi-Ken.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.585
Now, that's a collectible.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.880
- I thought that if you
didn't speak Spanish,

19:31.921 --> 19:34.549
you'd have an easier
time blending in.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.469
- So it's your fault
I'm not a real Lopez.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.262
- Oh, no, you're real Lopez.

to Chance and I in Spanish

20:00.241 --> 20:01.534
so it'll force us to learn?

I don't feel
as though I'm in a position
