01:05.519 --> 01:07.988
There's no sign of him.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.968
Perhaps they won't come.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.771
Oh, Jarl Borg has
many reasons to come,

01:17.200 --> 01:18.725
so he'll come.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.246
We will wait for
the treacherous devil,

01:23.320 --> 01:25.322
as well as your brother.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.121
Unless you have
heard from Rollo otherwise.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.690
No, King Horik.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.330
I've had no message
from my brother,

01:34.400 --> 01:38.610
but I still believe in my heart
that he will not betray me,

01:39.840 --> 01:41.490
for he has no reason.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.686
Who needs a reason
for betrayal?

01:49.360 --> 01:52.603
One must always think
the worst, Ragnar,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.489
even of your own kin.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.002
That way, you avoid too much
disappointment in life.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.082
(HORN BLOWS)

03:02.520 --> 03:05.000
There is the
treacherous one.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.208
I was right,
Ragnar.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.851
I was right.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.128
<i>(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)</i>

04:23.520 --> 04:25.329
Any regrets, Rollo?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.411
No regrets.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.089
Then let us fight.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.287
Let the gods
decide the outcome.

What is it you want?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.969
RIDER: I'm here on behalf
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.363
I want to speak
to his brother.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.404
Then speak.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.601
Rollo,

05:35.240 --> 05:38.164
you and I fought
together many times.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.447
I don't suppose
you've forgotten.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.850
I think of you
as a brother.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.366
But over there is
your real brother,

05:48.440 --> 05:50.442

05:51.440 --> 05:54.489
Are you sure you want to
raise your ax against him?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.289
Did Ragnar send you?

06:08.920 --> 06:11.161
What answer shall
I give him?

06:16.920 --> 06:20.003
Tell him I shall
answer him with blood.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.321
we have grown weary of the
slaughter of our young men.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.482
So, Jarl Borg,

13:23.720 --> 13:25.085
I offer you

13:25.880 --> 13:27.962
one third of the profits
from the disputed lands.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.283
Unless you continue
to dispute my claim to it.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.804
I would rather go back fighting,
than receive such scant justice.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.731
So, you will not
accept my fair offer?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.321
No.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.969
Why do we continue
looking inwards?

14:04.760 --> 14:05.966
Why?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.689
Why do we fight each other

14:09.760 --> 14:12.127
about this piece or
that piece of land?

14:13.600 --> 14:17.446
Why are we not
looking outwards.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.760
I have already
found a passage west.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.642
We, we have seen rich
and arable land over there.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.928
And there must be more.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.324
We must stop this.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.005
If we raided together,

14:41.960 --> 14:46.284
we would not need to fight
amongst ourselves.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.284
We would not need to kill
any more of our young folk.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.805
But instead,

14:54.960 --> 14:56.644
offer them land,

14:57.840 --> 15:00.047
land that they can farm.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.207
My mind tends
the same way as Ragnar's.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.200
It is my intention
to join with him

15:14.280 --> 15:15.930
and sail west.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.362
What do you say,
Jarl Borg?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.645
Yes,

15:27.080 --> 15:28.923
I will raid with you,

15:31.200 --> 15:33.362
and so I accept your offer.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.448
Not that you'd care,

15:56.400 --> 15:58.721

And Floki may not survive
for he is so badly wounded.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.605

your quarrel.

Yes. I chose,
and Rollo chose.

led to all of this!

tell her, boy?

It doesn't matter
what Bjorn says.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.129
What do you say?

19:26.320 --> 19:27.890

there to be problems.

up to the Law Rock

I conclude

their own judgment,

Just an ordinary man.

on the Sacred Stone.

that, don't you?

out of it, there was...

not even say goodbye to me?

prefer it that way.

have offered you?

No. That is not it.

a chance to be reborn,

to gain Valhalla.

to run away.

to go anywhere?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.890
I have come to say goodbye
to you properly.

28:23.240 --> 28:27.040
I have been thinking about you,
about when you were small.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.200
You were so lively.

28:30.280 --> 28:33.204
You could run as
swiftly as the wind.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.482
You were like quicksilver.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.122
But then, before I knew it,

28:40.800 --> 28:43.883
you stopped running here
and there and everywhere

28:43.960 --> 28:45.803
and you became still.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.849
At 12 years old,

28:51.680 --> 28:55.002
you had the stillness
and the calm of a fine woman.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.885
What children you
would have produced.

29:00.960 --> 29:05.204
What joy that would have
brought to all of us.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.845
Dear child,

29:18.120 --> 29:19.246
Gyda,

29:21.400 --> 29:24.688
you are not gone because
you are always in my heart.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.123
They say that a man
must love his sons more,

29:31.480 --> 29:34.051
but a man can be
jealous of his sons,

29:35.280 --> 29:38.682
and his daughter can always
be the light in his life.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.204
I know very well
that you are with the gods,

29:50.800 --> 29:53.121
but I will wait here awhile,

29:54.040 --> 29:57.726
and if you want to come and
talk to me, then come and talk,

30:01.120 --> 30:05.125
and I will gently stroke your long
and beautiful hair once again

30:06.080 --> 30:08.048
with my peasant hands.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.204
Father!

30:42.440 --> 30:43.441
What?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.363
BJORN: There's
someone coming.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.161
MAN: Keep steady!
Take the oars!

31:02.640 --> 31:04.324
Pull in the ropes!

31:26.640 --> 31:28.927
You must believe me,
I had no idea.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.321
I did not
ask her to come.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.605
Lagertha, Princess Aslaug.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.728
Princess Aslaug, Lagertha.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.528
I know who it is, Ragnar.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.201
Princess,
welcome to Kattegat.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.844
Thank you, Lagertha.

32:25.520 --> 32:29.320
This is our son,
Bjorn.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.205
I know Bjorn.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.165
Hello, Bjorn.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.363
You must have had a tiring journey.
Come and eat.

32:43.880 --> 32:47.043
Thank you. You're very kind.
I knew you would be.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.841
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:56.920 --> 32:59.161
(ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

33:02.600 --> 33:03.601
(BLEATING)

33:03.680 --> 33:05.250
(CLICKS TONGUE)

33:14.560 --> 33:17.689
Bjorn told me that your mother was
the shield-maiden, Brunhilde,

33:17.760 --> 33:19.330
of whom we've all heard?

33:19.400 --> 33:20.401
ASLAUG: It's true.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.400
Although she died
when I was very young.

33:23.520 --> 33:24.931
And your father?

33:25.640 --> 33:27.529
My father was Sigurd.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.046
Sigurd?

33:29.360 --> 33:30.850
Just Sigurd?

33:31.440 --> 33:34.410
No, I mean the Sigurd

33:34.480 --> 33:37.529
who, according to the sagas,
killed the dragon Fafnir.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.131
Then your father
is also a hero.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.283
People talk
about him, it's true,

33:44.440 --> 33:46.283
and I'm proud that
he was my father.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.930
But I never knew him.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.608
What about your parents?

33:53.120 --> 33:54.121
Hmm.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.882
They were just farmers.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.731
Surely nobody
is just a farmer.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.203
Believe me, Princess,

34:04.280 --> 34:08.330
that is exactly what some people
are, and are happy to be.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.045
Forgive me.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.491
Do you remember me, Bjorn?

34:16.560 --> 34:18.960
Do you remember we stood
in front of the tree of life?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.683
It wasn't Yggdrasil.
It was just a tree.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.800
You're right.
We both know that.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.688
It creates
a bond between us.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.409
I don't think so.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.208
We don't have any bond.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.760
I don't want
any bond with you.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.844
BJORN: Why don't you just tell
her that she has to leave soon?

34:47.400 --> 34:48.889
She can't stay here.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.447
She is carrying my child.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.000
She brings unhappiness
and difficulty.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.321
Can't you see that?
Are you blind?

35:00.520 --> 35:02.522
I know it is hard
for you to accept,

35:03.640 --> 35:06.689
but unhappiness is more
common than happiness.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.202
Who told you,
you should be happy?

35:13.920 --> 35:16.764
You've come to an age
where you must grow up

35:16.840 --> 35:19.320
and be responsible
about such things.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.971
When I was your age,
I had many friends.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.885
All are dead.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.884
Their happiness is
neither here nor there.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.130
SIGGY: How much do you
know about this woman?

35:37.200 --> 35:39.806
Only what Bjorn told me,
which was not much.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.611
He did not wish to be
disloyal to his father.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.487
(SIGHING)

35:46.560 --> 35:49.723
I did not know she was
carrying his child, though.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.529
And you believe it?

35:51.600 --> 35:53.682
Ragnar believes it.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.681
What of all her stories
of Brunhilde and Sigurd?

35:59.320 --> 36:00.481
I suppose so.

36:00.560 --> 36:03.245
She is clearly
different from us.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.083
What are you going to do?

36:12.640 --> 36:14.130
I don't know.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.766
I must do what is
right for my son.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.450
Floki.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.086
I'm not dead
yet, Bjorn.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.883
No thanks
to you, Ragnar.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.770
Oh, say what you'd
like about me.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.207
I'm just glad that the gods
were stupid enough to save you.

36:52.480 --> 36:53.811
The gods

36:55.560 --> 36:56.925
and Helga.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.682
You must regain
your strength.

37:03.880 --> 37:07.407
There's much to do. A whole
fleet of boats to be built.

37:07.480 --> 37:10.211
You and I have
seen nothing yet.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.487
Our journeys have just begun.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.124
It's true!

37:15.200 --> 37:17.009
I thought I was dead

37:17.600 --> 37:21.525
and while I was dead, I was
dreaming of other places,

37:21.600 --> 37:24.843
the places that you and I
shall sail to, Ragnar.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.690
(WHEEZING)

37:28.720 --> 37:29.846
Rest.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.410
Come on, boy.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.683
Floki!
MAN: Hey, Floki!

37:47.440 --> 37:49.363
Hello, Bjorn.
MAN 2: Floki!

38:17.760 --> 38:21.560
I hope you will accept what I
have chosen and prepared for you.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.846
I did not expect you to go
to so much trouble.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.810
It is no trouble,
if it is pleasing to you.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.410
To tell you the truth,

38:50.480 --> 38:52.608
I did not imagine
you could cook.

38:52.720 --> 38:53.721
(CHUCKLING)

38:53.840 --> 38:55.444
I can't. My women cooked,

38:55.560 --> 38:57.562
I just bought
the ingredients.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.922
Looking at both of
you here, in my home,

39:08.120 --> 39:11.602
I see no reason why you two
should not get on together.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.446
You two are very different,
yet both strong.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.121
I have heard that
similar arrangements exist

39:27.200 --> 39:29.282
all over this country.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.802
What arrangements?

39:38.280 --> 39:41.648
That an earl can live
with more than one woman.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.041
In fact, it is not unusual.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.166
It works to
the benefit of everyone,

39:52.240 --> 39:53.844
especially the children.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.767
Of both marriages,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.286
of course.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.848
It's true. I know of
many such instances.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.001
Yes.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.687
Is that what
you're suggesting?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.445
If I were,

40:28.920 --> 40:30.684
what would you say?

40:39.600 --> 40:43.685
I'm sorry, but this woman
is carrying my child.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.526
I must take care of her.
You must accept her.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.842
When we lost
our unborn son,

40:56.040 --> 40:58.122
it broke my heart.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.124
I had failed and I
will not fail again.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.446
I cannot turn
this woman away.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.247
I have to take
care of my child.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.526
(SIGHING)

41:39.240 --> 41:41.083
Don't forget the ax.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.762
You are leaving then?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.643
Of course I'm leaving.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.005
Is Bjorn going with you?

42:00.880 --> 42:02.530
That's up to Bjorn.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.283
Bjorn, you have
a big choice to make.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.086
I admire your mother.
We all do.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.685
But you have to
stay with your father.

42:23.760 --> 42:27.481
If you don't, you will regret
it for the rest of your life.

42:29.040 --> 42:33.807
Remember, your father
is Ragnar Lothbrok.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.646
Bjorn.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.644
You have to choose.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.050
Say it now.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.248
I choose my father.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.611
(VOICE TREMBLING)
Very well.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.401
What?

44:38.120 --> 44:39.645
Mother's left.

44:43.960 --> 44:45.086
Move!

44:58.120 --> 45:00.771
You're really
going to abandon me

45:00.840 --> 45:03.002
without even saying a word?

45:04.240 --> 45:07.210
You insult and
humiliate me.

45:08.280 --> 45:11.363
I have no choice
but to leave you

45:11.440 --> 45:13.010
and divorce you.

45:13.640 --> 45:15.642
I don't want you to go.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.401
It's fate.

45:34.080 --> 45:37.766
I've changed my mind.
I'm coming with you.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.483
Look after your mother.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.640
Come on.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.950
Move on.
