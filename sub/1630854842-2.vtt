00:41.375 --> 00:44.166
<i>Let go of me.</i>

00:47.416 --> 00:49.375
<i>Let go of me.</i>

00:50.958 --> 00:52.333
<i>Let go of me.</i>

00:53.333 --> 00:55.375
<i>Let go of me!</i>

01:15.083 --> 01:16.500
Lockwood?

01:17.708 --> 01:19.541
-Lockwood?

01:21.208 --> 01:22.541
Lockwood?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.208
-Found one!
-Lockwood!

01:25.291 --> 01:26.916
-Over here.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.041
-Lockwood!
-We're DEPRAC.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.333
-Is there anyone else here?
-Lockwood!

02:35.250 --> 02:36.750
Miss Lockwood?

02:36.833 --> 02:40.208
No, that's the agency name.
My name's Lucy Carlyle.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.791
-Sorry, must have been a mix-up.
-Lockwood's my partner.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.666
Well, um… more like, uh… my employer.

02:47.416 --> 02:49.250
Or my… co-worker, really.

02:50.208 --> 02:53.166
-Is he here?
-No. We called your mother.

02:54.458 --> 02:56.666
You… you didn't tell her
where I was, did you?

02:57.166 --> 02:59.750
She didn't ask, love.
She sounded very busy.

03:00.416 --> 03:02.375
I'll get the doctor to check you over.
Stay there.

03:02.458 --> 03:04.625
Rest up until he's given you
the all-clear.

03:36.625 --> 03:37.625
Miss Carlyle?

03:38.458 --> 03:40.250
-Lucy Carlyle?

03:44.958 --> 03:45.916
Oh my God.

04:15.625 --> 04:16.791
Mr. Lockwood.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.291
Yes. Hello.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.500
-Who do I have the pleasure--
-Inspector Barnes.

04:22.916 --> 04:25.750
From the Department
of Psychical Research and Control.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.375
And I don't enjoy meeting agents
who burn homes to the ground,

04:29.458 --> 04:30.875
put lives at risk,

04:30.958 --> 04:33.708
and break the law so many ways
they might as well not know it exists.

04:33.791 --> 04:36.750
If you just give me a moment
to tell you my side of the story.

04:37.916 --> 04:39.000
You may not be aware,

04:39.083 --> 04:43.916
but we were given an entirely misleading
account of the situation on the premises.

04:45.208 --> 04:48.375
We were then violently ambushed by…

04:52.041 --> 04:53.166
This can't be right.

04:53.250 --> 04:56.500
You owe Mrs. Hope £60,000 in damages
to be paid within two weeks,

04:56.583 --> 04:58.083
or her lawyers will have you shut down.

04:58.166 --> 05:01.708
I think you'll find you owe it,
as we're covered by DEPRAC insurance.

05:01.791 --> 05:05.875
You used a magnesium flare indoors
and had no iron chains.

05:06.416 --> 05:07.958
Your policy is void.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.166
I pulled your file.

05:10.250 --> 05:13.041
Says here you've set up on your own.
No supervision.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.458
Maybe leave it to the adults
before somebody dies.

05:15.541 --> 05:18.041
No one died.
And no one will whilst I'm in charge.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.750
You're not in charge. I am.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.333
Pay up or get shut down.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.708
-Where's Lockwood?
-Don't sound too pleased to see me.

05:49.208 --> 05:52.041
How about, "Oh my God, Lucy,
I'm so glad you're okay,"

05:52.125 --> 05:53.750
or, "I'm so relieved you're still alive"?

05:53.833 --> 05:57.625
Oh my God, Lucy, I'm so glad you're okay.
I'm so relieved you're still alive.

05:57.708 --> 06:01.083
-Don't just say exactly those words!
-Lucy, where's Lockwood?

06:01.166 --> 06:04.041
How the hell should I know?
He just… disappeared.

06:05.041 --> 06:07.458
You've been in a hospital.
Why were you in a hospital?

06:07.541 --> 06:09.208
George, just give me a second.

06:09.291 --> 06:12.750
If you're talking metaphorically,
please tell me what you mean by a second.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.375
Because if it's longer than a minute,
I'll occupy myself

06:15.458 --> 06:17.916
-while you waste your time--
-In the last 12 hours,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.375
I have nearly been murdered by a Type Two.

06:20.458 --> 06:21.416
Twice.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.958
I've jumped from a burning house,
fallen 20 feet face-first into a bush,

06:25.041 --> 06:29.000
and had a tube shoved down me throat to
hoover out me lungs, so give me a second!

06:30.250 --> 06:32.333
If you'd waited for me,
none of this would've happened.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.250
You were late.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.208
I was doing my job
so we'd know what we were walking into,

06:36.291 --> 06:38.833
which I'm assuming wasn't
some old man who fell down the stairs--

06:38.916 --> 06:40.000
That's her.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.083
How exactly did the house
catch fire, Lucy?

06:42.166 --> 06:43.375
God, she was so young.

06:43.458 --> 06:47.333
-You burned it down, didn't you?
-This woman. Who was she?

06:47.416 --> 06:50.416
-You're not even listening.
-George. This picture.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.291
This is the woman
whose ghost attacked us last night.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.750
It felt like… she needed my help.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.791
Tell me who she was.

06:59.458 --> 07:03.458
She was a rising star in the '80s, all set
for Hollywood, until she went missing.

07:03.541 --> 07:08.166
We found her body bricked up in a chimney.
Someone did that to her.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.916
Maybe if you'd been more interested
before you went charging--

07:11.000 --> 07:13.333
That was Lockwood's decision.
I've only just started.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.666
-What am I supposed to say to him?
-You're meant to say no.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.375
-You have to, or you'll make him worse.

07:18.458 --> 07:22.291
Glad to see you two getting on without me.
I'd say like a house on fire, but--

07:22.375 --> 07:23.875
-Where have you been?
-Aren't you hurt?

07:23.958 --> 07:26.041
-Why didn't you wait?
-George knows who that ghost was.

07:26.125 --> 07:28.416
-He said--
-Can we please do this later?

07:28.500 --> 07:31.208
I need to sleep.
Let's catch up over breakfast, yeah?

07:32.083 --> 07:35.291
If you can make your <i>ghormeh sabzi</i>
with a shedload of rice,

07:35.375 --> 07:36.750
I'd love you forever, mate.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.666
Interesting outfit, Luce.

07:41.166 --> 07:44.875
Didn't have you down
as a fan of unicorns. Or rainbows.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.166
<i>Let go of me.</i>

08:21.083 --> 08:22.916
<i>Let go of me!</i>

08:36.500 --> 08:37.666
<i>Lucy?</i>

08:39.000 --> 08:39.833
<i>Lucy?</i>

08:41.541 --> 08:42.375
<i>Lucy!</i>

08:43.083 --> 08:45.375
-What are you doing?

08:47.375 --> 08:48.583
There is a lock, you know.

08:48.666 --> 08:50.833
And other people
who need to use the toilet.

08:51.583 --> 08:52.916
What's wrong with you?

08:53.416 --> 08:54.666
This is not normal.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.541
<i>Hey, Norrie.</i>

09:04.000 --> 09:05.666
<i>You'd never guess where I am.</i>

09:07.541 --> 09:08.791
<i>Kept our promise.</i>

09:10.541 --> 09:11.583
<i>I'm in London.</i>

09:12.333 --> 09:16.125
Fittes and Rotwell wouldn't even
look at me, so I've ended up in a…

09:19.375 --> 09:21.125
I don't even know where I've ended up.

09:21.875 --> 09:25.333
Some… tiny agency run by two boys.

09:25.916 --> 09:28.166
A posh one who thinks he's God's gift,

09:28.250 --> 09:30.750
and his weird mate
with zero social skills.

09:32.416 --> 09:36.375
Last night we burnt a house down
fighting a Type Two.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.708
Her ghost…

09:40.583 --> 09:42.125
she really reminded me of you.

09:44.666 --> 09:46.833
When I made contact with her, it was like…

09:48.250 --> 09:52.708
I don't know, like I… I felt something
that I've never felt before.

09:52.791 --> 09:53.875
Like she was…

09:54.958 --> 09:58.000
Oh, God… like…
like she was inside my head.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.458
Like she needed me, right?

09:59.541 --> 10:01.333
Like… like I had to help her.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.083
Like how
I should have helped you.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.833
I think I might be losing it.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.291
I wish you were here with me, Norrie.

10:26.541 --> 10:27.708
I miss you.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.458
I really miss you.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.666
Thanks. Looks great.

10:42.166 --> 10:45.166
No, it doesn't. It looks like
I cooked it in an active volcano.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.750
So, I've got the whole story now.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.875
-And so has the rest of London.
-"Rogue" sounds pretty cool.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.708
"Blamed for blaze"
kind of takes the shine off it.

10:56.791 --> 10:59.625
Oh, great. They called me Andrew Lockwood.

11:00.416 --> 11:04.583
I hardly think that's our biggest problem.
We've had a bunch of cancellations.

11:04.666 --> 11:07.708
-And DEPRAC will be furious.
-We'll be fine. I'll fix it.

11:07.791 --> 11:09.125
Okay, but it's not just that.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.791
I think something's wrong with Lucy.

11:12.875 --> 11:14.291
We're all a little on edge today.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.250
She had a bath with her clothes on.

11:16.916 --> 11:18.583
Girls are funny about baths.

11:19.375 --> 11:21.416
-Best to leave them to it.
-It's not funny.

11:21.500 --> 11:25.291
Ever since you hired her, things have
gone downhill. What if she's unhinged?

11:25.375 --> 11:28.083
-She's not unhinged.
-You're hardly the best judge.

11:28.666 --> 11:31.916
-You need normal people around you.
-You really think you're normal?

11:32.416 --> 11:35.541
If you were, you'd have stayed at Fittes,
and we'd never be friends.

11:37.208 --> 11:41.250
You know, everyone pretends
they've got things under control.

11:41.916 --> 11:45.125
DEPRAC, the big agencies.
It's all a facade.

11:45.750 --> 11:48.666
The world's mad,
and normal never fixed anything.

11:49.666 --> 11:52.375
We understand that. It's our USP.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.208
You get way too lost in the research,

11:55.291 --> 11:58.083
but you find the gold
that everyone else misses.

11:58.583 --> 12:04.416
And, yeah, Lucy can be a bit… quirky,
but she's one of us.

12:05.916 --> 12:06.958
I'm sure of it.

12:07.791 --> 12:12.041
She burned down a house. She's going mad.
You need to fire her, Lockwood.

12:14.375 --> 12:16.166
Let me… sleep on it.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.041
If you hurt me,

13:27.416 --> 13:29.125
I can't help you.

13:32.416 --> 13:33.791
Let me go.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.625
Lockwood, wake up!

13:48.541 --> 13:49.375
She's here.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.916
-Who?
-Annabel Ward. The ghost from Sheen Road.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.625
Come on, where's your kit bag?

13:54.708 --> 13:56.208
Downstairs. Grab those boots.

13:56.291 --> 13:57.166
Boots?

14:03.541 --> 14:06.333
Can't you even be bothered
to cross the landing to wind me up?

14:06.416 --> 14:09.041
-Annabel Ward's ghost is here.
-Well, that's impossible.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.666
Why would I be lying?
She was in my room just now.

14:12.666 --> 14:15.875
Okay. 20 seconds. Non-metaphorical.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.541
All that and still no trousers?

14:29.291 --> 14:30.708
Trousers are for wimps.

14:39.750 --> 14:40.875
I don't feel anything.

14:42.541 --> 14:46.416
-I don't see anything.
-She was here. I swear.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.333
You woke up
and she was floating above you?

15:00.416 --> 15:01.291
Yes.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.833
It makes no sense
that she'd be here.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.208
We contained her source.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.666
Covered her body with a silver net.

15:11.666 --> 15:16.083
How did she even get in here? It's not
as if her source is inside the house.

15:20.625 --> 15:21.458
Is it?

15:25.708 --> 15:26.875
Uh… She's back.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.000
She's playing with us.

15:39.625 --> 15:40.625
George.

15:41.625 --> 15:44.125
Don't… move.

15:46.041 --> 15:47.916
Please tell me it's a wasp.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.458
-Stand perfectly still.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.791
-On second thoughts, move!

15:59.666 --> 16:00.791
Not a wasp, then.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.125
Lucy, if you have any idea
what her source might be,

16:06.208 --> 16:07.708
now would be a really good time to say.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.041
Oh. Um…

16:10.041 --> 16:16.208
I'm starting to think that…
I mean, I might have an idea what it is.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.333
Take your time.
We're not under any pressure.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.208
Where is it, Lucy?

16:28.291 --> 16:31.625
Well, I had her ring in my hand,
and then I fell asleep with it.

16:31.708 --> 16:34.375
-Oh. And now we're all gonna die.
-So it's in the bed?

16:34.458 --> 16:38.458
Yeah. Well, maybe.
But I… I don't know. It could be.

16:38.541 --> 16:40.083
Well, we need to contain it.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.208
-Oh shit.
-George, switch.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.291
Here she is.

16:54.666 --> 16:57.208
Get behind me. Hold the chain.

16:59.541 --> 17:01.250
-Watch out!

17:01.333 --> 17:02.916
-Whoa!
-Got her!

17:04.291 --> 17:06.916
George, throw it all.
Everything you've got!

17:13.791 --> 17:15.833
I didn't know it was the source.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.041
I just took it because…

17:19.041 --> 17:21.333
it's like I can feel what she feels.

17:21.833 --> 17:22.916
What she wants.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.833
Uh…

17:24.666 --> 17:26.166
No, it's hard to explain.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.166
-A psychic connection.
-Yes!

17:29.250 --> 17:32.041
I literally cannot believe
you stole a source from a crime scene.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.333
DEPRAC will bury us.

17:33.416 --> 17:36.416
Excuse me. I'm not the only one
round here who steals sources.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.416
What about that ridiculous skull
you're always experimenting on?

17:39.500 --> 17:42.375
Annabel was stuck behind a wall
for 40 years

17:42.458 --> 17:44.916
with nobody knowing
and DEPRAC doing sod all.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.666
She needs our help.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.791
And what does she expect you to do,
exactly, after all this time?

17:49.875 --> 17:52.458
Solve this. Get justice.

17:52.541 --> 17:54.291
She's dead, Lucy.

17:54.375 --> 17:59.791
We can't help a ghost. We need to destroy
her source and move on. Let her go.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.000
Come on, George. Back me up.

18:05.666 --> 18:06.958
You love a new experiment.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.583
Why throw away the chance
to investigate a new phenomenon?

18:09.666 --> 18:12.791
Nice try, but psychic connections
are weak science.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.750
You felt sorry for her.
You heard her death loop. End of story.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.208
So prove it.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.333
Before you destroy the ring, let me try
to connect with her one last time.

18:21.416 --> 18:24.625
See what else I can feel.
Let me prove to you that it is real.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.541
No way. Too dangerous.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.208
It is almost dawn.
Her ghost will be much weaker.

18:30.291 --> 18:34.750
No. We've only just
escaped with our lives. Twice.

18:34.833 --> 18:39.166
Because you were unprepared. Twice.
This time, we'll do it properly.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.250
I need to do this.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.666
What was that you were saying
about normal people?

19:13.833 --> 19:17.625
If she takes any liberties,
we're right here, okay?

19:17.708 --> 19:18.625
Okay.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.041
Be careful.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.375
It's okay, Annabel.

19:55.208 --> 19:56.250
It's safe.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.541
There's a song playing in the room.

20:13.791 --> 20:16.583
-<i>Dance with me.</i>
-<i>I'm not in the mood.</i>

20:16.666 --> 20:17.875
She loves it.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.416
-<i>It's our song, come on.</i>
-It's their song.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.916
-Who's they? Annabel and--
-Shh.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.000
-She's so happy.

20:30.916 --> 20:31.958
She loves him.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.791
<i>Go on. I'll watch.</i>

20:34.750 --> 20:36.625
<i>If you insist.</i>

20:38.375 --> 20:40.125
She's dancing to the song.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.000
He's watching her.

20:46.541 --> 20:47.916
<i>Are you honest?</i>

20:48.000 --> 20:49.458
<i>My Lord…</i>

20:51.041 --> 20:53.041
<i>Have you told him where to go?</i>

20:54.166 --> 20:56.291
-<i>No…</i>
-He wants her, but it's just…

20:56.375 --> 20:59.625
-<i>I said I'd give…</i>
-Uh…

20:59.708 --> 21:02.375
-What is it?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.541
<i>I did nothing--</i>

21:05.833 --> 21:08.083
-<i>You're lying to me.</i>
-He's angry.

21:08.166 --> 21:11.416
-<i>I swear. Let me go!</i>
-Jealous.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.166
-<i>I'm not!</i>
-<i>You're lying!</i>

21:13.250 --> 21:15.250
-<i>I swear. Let me go.</i>
-She's afraid.

21:15.958 --> 21:16.958
Again--

21:17.041 --> 21:18.916
-<i>You know this--</i>

21:20.708 --> 21:22.041
-Yes.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.333
-<i>You're lying to me, Annabel!</i>

21:24.416 --> 21:26.958
- <i>I'm not.</i>
-It's all right.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.333
-<i>I swear.</i>
-He loves me.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.166
You love me, don't you?

21:32.708 --> 21:36.583
You gave me the ring.
He'd never hurt me. He'd never…

21:36.666 --> 21:38.791
We need to stop this. Now.

21:38.875 --> 21:41.625
-Look at me. Look at me. Look.
-Let's just see what happens.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.208
-No. Stop.

21:43.291 --> 21:44.666
Stop. Stop, please!

21:44.750 --> 21:47.500
-Ow! You're hurting me! Don't.
-<i>Please!</i>

21:47.583 --> 21:49.666
No, don't. Look at me. Look at me.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.750
-Lucy.
-Look! Stop, please! Let me go!

21:55.166 --> 21:56.833
I can't… Let me breathe.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.708
-Let go of me!
-Stop it.

21:58.791 --> 22:00.375
-Lucy. Stop it! Annabel!
-Let go of me!

22:18.791 --> 22:20.500
He choked her to death.

22:23.708 --> 22:26.583
The ring stays in the basement
until we take it to the furnaces.

22:26.666 --> 22:29.375
What? Why would we stop
when we're just getting somewhere?

22:29.458 --> 22:31.958
No more pet projects.
There's bills to pay.

22:32.458 --> 22:33.416
Uh, what bills?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.666
-£60,000?
-What?

22:40.750 --> 22:42.208
In two weeks? What the hell?

22:42.291 --> 22:45.375
-Why didn't you say something?
-Because it's my name on the door.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.708
It's my responsibility. I'll find a way.

22:47.791 --> 22:50.333
How? We hardly break even
when things are going well!

22:50.416 --> 22:53.000
What about a loan?
This place must be worth a bucketload.

22:53.791 --> 22:56.625
This place is all that's left
of my parents.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.666
Sorry. I didn't realize.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.125
He's already borrowed against it
to set up the business.

23:02.208 --> 23:03.750
Jesus, Lockwood, we're screwed!

23:03.833 --> 23:07.291
No, we're not.
All it takes is a few big cases.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.291
Maybe that's one right now.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.958
Lockwood & Co., how may I help you?

23:19.041 --> 23:20.666
<i>By firing Lucy Carlyle.</i>

23:22.916 --> 23:23.916
Immediately.

23:24.916 --> 23:27.083
And why would I do that, Inspector?

23:27.166 --> 23:29.708
<i>Because you and I</i>
<i>don't want any more bad press.</i>

23:29.791 --> 23:32.000
<i>And I barely had to scratch the surface</i>

23:32.083 --> 23:34.208
<i>to find you'd employed an agent</i>
<i>at full status</i>

23:34.291 --> 23:37.541
<i>when she hadn't attained a grade four,</i>
<i>which is illegal.</i>

23:38.208 --> 23:41.208
Now, I'm assuming that she lied to you,
because if not--

23:41.291 --> 23:43.500
<i>Surely you have bigger things</i>
<i>to deal with?</i>

23:46.416 --> 23:50.500
See, the little things help me
take out the bigger problems.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.208
<i>Your agency is a big problem.</i>

23:54.000 --> 23:57.208
-Come on now, Inspector.
<i>-Get rid of her, Mr. Lockwood.</i>

24:00.708 --> 24:01.625
Who was it?

24:04.250 --> 24:05.125
Wrong number.

24:07.166 --> 24:10.708
Listen. Exactly how famous
did you say Annabel was?

24:11.416 --> 24:13.125
We've been looking at it
the wrong way round.

24:13.208 --> 24:16.458
It's not about us helping Annabel.
It's about her helping us.

24:16.541 --> 24:17.541
Really? How?

24:17.625 --> 24:21.208
It's all about media exposure.
Annabel's disappearance was a big story.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.583
It's far bigger
than us burning a house down.

24:23.666 --> 24:26.500
If we solve her murder,
the headlines we'll get

24:26.583 --> 24:28.333
will cancel out all our bad press
overnight.

24:28.416 --> 24:30.208
I thought you said no more pet projects.

24:30.291 --> 24:32.750
It's not a pet project anymore.
It's the main event.

24:32.833 --> 24:35.750
-It won't make us 60 grand.
-It could make us more.

24:35.833 --> 24:38.291
I mean, think of the millions
of old people sat at home,

24:38.375 --> 24:41.583
nothing to do but reminisce
and read the papers.

24:41.666 --> 24:43.333
They love murder mysteries.

24:43.416 --> 24:46.375
It's a bona fide front-page splash.
Barnes won't dare move against us.

24:46.458 --> 24:48.750
Leave me out of it.
I don't like me name in the papers.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.750
-Had enough of that crap back home.
-You have to know how to deal with them.

24:51.833 --> 24:52.916
-Leave that to me.
-Ah--

24:53.500 --> 24:55.958
I mean it. Keep me out of the spotlight.

24:56.041 --> 24:58.041
The most important thing
is solving the case.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.625
This is where it all happens.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.791
Quietly. So behave yourselves, okay?

25:13.083 --> 25:16.041
This is it.
She was in <i>Hamlet, </i>playing Ophelia.

25:16.666 --> 25:17.916
What does that tell us?

25:19.375 --> 25:22.291
Ugh. Why must I be surrounded
by philistines? Wait there.

25:28.375 --> 25:33.375
"Annabel Ward's moving Ophelia
captures the depths of tragic romance."

25:33.458 --> 25:34.500
Precisely.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.541
These kind of depths.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.833
That's why you were lying
in the bath fully dressed.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.833
Ophelia drowned with daisies.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.166
That's why I took them.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.583
She went mad, killed herself
'cause of how Hamlet treated her.

25:46.666 --> 25:47.958
But Annabel didn't kill herself.

25:48.041 --> 25:52.125
But the part she played and what happened
in her life started mirroring each other.

25:52.208 --> 25:55.416
Hamlet and Ophelia,
Annabel and her abusive lover.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.750
Wait, so you think
whoever played Hamlet did it?

25:57.833 --> 26:00.333
Hugo Blake. That's his name. Look.

26:00.916 --> 26:03.458
"The case of Annabel Ward
took another twist last night

26:03.541 --> 26:07.208
when actor Hugo Blake was arrested
in connection with her disappearance."

26:07.291 --> 26:10.916
"Ward was rumored to be in a relationship
with her dashing <i>Hamlet </i>co-star

26:11.000 --> 26:12.750
after the pair were spotted together

26:12.833 --> 26:15.458
having an intimate dinner
at a private members' club."

26:15.541 --> 26:17.958
Nice one, Lockwood.
Not bad for a philistine.

26:18.458 --> 26:20.750
Look! She's wearing the ring.

26:20.833 --> 26:23.291
So Blake was arrested,
but he still got away with it?

26:23.375 --> 26:26.833
Well, there was no hard evidence.
No eyewitnesses, no body.

26:26.916 --> 26:27.833
Hey!

26:28.500 --> 26:30.916
"Blake was released Monday night
without charge."

26:31.000 --> 26:33.958
"Police said their investigation
had run dry."

26:34.041 --> 26:35.291
Unlike ours.

26:35.375 --> 26:36.791
Well done, Tony.

26:37.958 --> 26:40.500
Doing your research
<i>before </i>the job this time.

26:40.583 --> 26:43.291
Hmm. Is it Tony? Or is he Andrew now?

26:43.375 --> 26:47.958
Keep it down, Kipps. This is a library,
not a braying gallery for bellends.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.583
Aah.

26:51.416 --> 26:54.000
This must be your… new assistant.

26:54.958 --> 26:55.791
Colleague.

26:56.750 --> 27:00.041
And you must be Quill Kipps.
I've read about you.

27:00.583 --> 27:03.416
Haven't you got the highest mortality rate
of any team leader?

27:04.250 --> 27:08.083
I'm the top supervisor
at the country's top agency.

27:10.333 --> 27:15.250
I get the most dangerous jobs
precisely because of, well, how good I am.

27:16.916 --> 27:19.666
But I handle it. Unlike him.

27:22.291 --> 27:23.958
You won't stick around too long,
sweetheart.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Not when you find out
what he's really like.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.916
Everyone leaves him in the end.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.833
Her name's Lucy.

27:36.583 --> 27:37.791
My name's Lockwood.

27:38.833 --> 27:40.041
And you need a ladder.

27:41.875 --> 27:43.125
Uh… No, I don't.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.000
Yes, you do.

27:53.291 --> 27:56.333
-He doesn't like you much, does he?
-He's an irrelevant prick.

27:56.416 --> 27:57.375
Ignore him.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.208
We need to track down Hugo Blake.

27:59.291 --> 28:03.416
There's something else I need to do first.
Why don't you two grab dinner? My treat.

28:08.875 --> 28:11.250
Do you like… Italian?

28:11.875 --> 28:13.791
If you mean pizza?

28:13.875 --> 28:16.583
That's exactly what I mean,
and I know a really good place.

28:19.916 --> 28:23.250
Hmm. This is the best
Italian restaurant I've ever been to.

28:25.625 --> 28:29.875
-So have you always lived here?
-Zone six. Much nicer and safer.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.041
Why'd you leave?

28:31.708 --> 28:34.041
My mum and dad are lovely,
but I couldn't stay.

28:34.791 --> 28:39.125
They had four kids. Engineer,
engineer, engineer, weirdo.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.916
-So have you always been a bit…
-Obsessed?

28:43.583 --> 28:47.333
Yeah. The Problem's all I've ever known.
All any of us have ever known.

28:47.416 --> 28:50.250
That's not okay, so I wanna find out…

28:51.125 --> 28:52.958
-What?
-Everything!

28:53.833 --> 28:56.458
That's why I got fired from Fittes.
Did Lockwood tell you?

28:56.541 --> 28:57.833
-No!
-It's true.

28:57.916 --> 29:01.000
For asking too many questions,
visiting floors above my pay grade.

29:01.083 --> 29:02.958
George Karim, I am shocked!

29:03.041 --> 29:05.666
Don't worry,
I took the skull as compensation.

29:05.750 --> 29:11.333
So… do you think, like,
we're being lied to about everything?

29:11.416 --> 29:13.125
Of course we're being lied to.

29:13.208 --> 29:16.791
But by who? And why?
And what can we do about it?

29:16.875 --> 29:20.541
You know, I had this friend who was
convinced that none of it made sense.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.583
How it started, how it spread,

29:22.666 --> 29:25.583
how it only seems to get worse,
not better, no matter what we do.

29:26.708 --> 29:30.791
Well, he's dead now. Maybe he's got
all the answers on the other side.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.875
Is he who you dreamed
about coming to London with?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.208
No.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.416
That was someone else.

29:39.958 --> 29:41.541
But we were all on the same job.

29:42.041 --> 29:44.875
It went wrong. Horribly.
My boss blamed me.

29:44.958 --> 29:46.958
Everyone did. Even my mum.

29:47.791 --> 29:48.916
So I had to get away.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.166
Somewhere I might actually matter.

29:54.416 --> 29:58.583
<i>Yes, we risked our lives, but</i>
<i>that is how important this case is to us.</i>

29:58.666 --> 30:02.625
<i>Annabel Ward could have been a superstar,</i>
<i>but instead, she was cruelly murdered.</i>

30:03.500 --> 30:07.083
<i>For far too long,</i>
<i>the authorities at DEPRAC have stood by</i>

30:07.166 --> 30:09.958
<i>and allowed this cruel injustice</i>
<i>to remain unsolved.</i>

30:10.041 --> 30:11.666
<i>They've let the public down.</i>

30:15.625 --> 30:18.625
-Was I too nice to Mr. Lockwood?
Undoubtedly.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.875
Dragging DEPRAC through the mud so he can
save his school project of an agency.

30:23.958 --> 30:25.916
Who the hell does he think he is?

30:26.541 --> 30:28.166
He's a little shit, sir.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.041
<i>Just because</i>
<i>it happened decades ago</i>

30:30.125 --> 30:31.833
<i>doesn't mean it doesn't matter now.</i>

30:31.916 --> 30:35.875
<i>Luckily, at Lockwood & Co., we have</i>
<i>our own superstar, Miss Lucy Carlyle,</i>

30:35.958 --> 30:39.375
<i>who not only helped neutralize</i>
<i>a vicious Type Two,</i>

30:39.458 --> 30:42.583
<i>but also used</i>
<i>her extraordinary listening talents</i>

30:42.666 --> 30:44.500
<i>to connect with Annabel's ghost.</i>

30:44.583 --> 30:48.000
<i>And, as a result, we believe</i>
<i>we are closer to finding Annabel's killer</i>

30:48.083 --> 30:49.791
<i>than the police or DEPRAC--</i>

30:50.958 --> 30:54.208
I told you to leave me out of it.

30:54.291 --> 30:57.708
And I told you I'd handle it. What are you
so worried about? It's all true.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.541
We haven't even solved the case yet.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.708
What if Hugo Blake sees that
and comes after me?

31:02.791 --> 31:06.708
Well, then, we'll look after you, Luce.
You're our biggest asset.

31:08.958 --> 31:09.958
Asset?

31:10.625 --> 31:14.000
Is that all I am, then?
Just some thing to make you money?

31:16.125 --> 31:19.333
You think that
you do things so differently.

31:20.833 --> 31:24.250
But you're just like the rest of them.
You're as bad as everyone back home.

31:28.125 --> 31:29.875
-Dick move, Lockwood.
-How?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.958
I flattered her on national television.

31:33.041 --> 31:35.625
After she specifically asked you
to leave her out of it.

31:35.708 --> 31:38.458
What's your problem?
You wanted me to fire her last night.

31:40.750 --> 31:42.000
Maybe you were right.

31:44.416 --> 31:48.541
Maybe… my judgment's
been a little off recently.

31:49.583 --> 31:53.000
Barnes knows she's illegal.
I had to do something.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.500
My judgment was off too.

31:55.583 --> 31:59.000
She's got nowhere else to go.
I don't think you should fire her.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.041
Let's let her cool off for a bit.

32:03.958 --> 32:05.750
-Hah!

32:40.208 --> 32:41.791
-Open up.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.500
Open the door!

32:48.791 --> 32:50.000
Get the girl.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.083
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

32:54.083 --> 32:57.291
I promise.
Whatever it is, I'll deal with it.

33:01.041 --> 33:02.125
You can wait here.

33:03.041 --> 33:04.250
It's Miss Carlyle I need.

33:04.333 --> 33:07.875
No. There's nothing you need to say to her
that you can't say to me.

33:07.958 --> 33:10.333
I said wait here,
or you can wait in the cells.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.708
I don't need looking after.

33:14.875 --> 33:15.875
Not by you.

33:17.958 --> 33:21.166
We're very excited to have
a celebrity like you helping us at DEPRAC.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.333
I'm not…

33:22.416 --> 33:24.666
I hear you've been getting full statements
from Type Twos.

33:24.750 --> 33:25.833
I never said that.

33:26.333 --> 33:29.708
Hmm. I thought you were using
your extraordinary talent

33:29.791 --> 33:31.958
to find out who Annabel Ward's killer was?

33:32.041 --> 33:34.333
Yeah. Yeah, his name's Hugo Blake.

33:34.416 --> 33:35.250
-Is it?
-Yeah.

33:36.041 --> 33:38.166
Sure you didn't read that
in an old newspaper?

33:38.791 --> 33:40.833
No. It's much more than that.

33:40.916 --> 33:44.791
Oh. Good. 'Cause we've brought him in,
but we don't have enough to charge him.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.500
Maybe you can help.

33:47.833 --> 33:49.125
…Agent D…

33:52.791 --> 33:55.291
Sheen Road used to be a lodging house.

33:56.125 --> 33:58.750
Blake says he dropped her off,
but never went inside.

33:58.833 --> 34:01.625
He's always maintained
they were just friends.

34:01.708 --> 34:02.833
Well, that's not true.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.208
Then get us the evidence.

34:17.875 --> 34:19.750
You're accusing him of murder.

34:20.291 --> 34:23.166
Use your extraordinary connection
to Annabel to prove it.

34:28.291 --> 34:31.375
Wait, no… No, no…
It… it doesn't work like this.

34:32.041 --> 34:33.375
I can't just switch it on.

34:33.458 --> 34:36.083
I connected with Annabel
because I felt something for her.

34:36.166 --> 34:37.500
I was trying to do something good.

34:37.583 --> 34:41.041
Well, here's your chance to do more good.
Help us put him away.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.708
No. I've told you, I can't.

34:44.791 --> 34:48.041
He can't see you. He doesn't even know
you're here. Come on, try.

34:48.125 --> 34:49.666
What do you expect me to do?

34:50.916 --> 34:52.041
Channel her.

34:53.083 --> 34:54.750
Give us something only she'd know.

34:55.333 --> 34:59.125
Identify him as her killer.
Go on, if you're so sure he's guilty.

35:03.708 --> 35:04.750
Oh my God.

35:12.916 --> 35:14.916
You're getting something,
aren't you?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.791
I…

35:18.000 --> 35:18.916
I can't.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.250
I…

35:20.333 --> 35:22.958
-Tell me what you're getting.
-I need to get out of here.

35:23.041 --> 35:24.625
Not before you tell us what you know.

35:24.708 --> 35:27.000
-No, I don't know anything.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.833
I can't feel anything.
There is nothing there.

35:28.916 --> 35:31.125
-You lied to save yourself from firing.
-Let me go.

35:31.208 --> 35:33.916
-And your agency from being shut down.
-Let me out of here! Let me go!

35:43.291 --> 35:44.541
It's okay.

35:45.375 --> 35:46.250
He's gone.

35:47.166 --> 35:50.291
But listen to me.
He still has friends in high places.

35:50.375 --> 35:53.250
They've got him good lawyers.
We won't be able to hold him long.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.916
Unless… you've got anything else?

36:00.875 --> 36:01.708
Shame.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.791
This is good for one free journey,
back home.

36:12.708 --> 36:15.708
-That's not my home anymore.
-Lockwood's a charlatan.

36:15.791 --> 36:18.125
He cuts corners and puts lives at risk.

36:18.666 --> 36:21.708
He saw a vulnerable girl
without the right qualifications,

36:22.583 --> 36:25.041
alone and out of her depth
in the big city,

36:25.125 --> 36:26.583
and he took advantage of her.

36:27.083 --> 36:27.958
Please.

36:29.625 --> 36:31.500
Go home while you still can.

36:39.291 --> 36:40.916
<i>I knew that's what he'd do.</i>

36:41.625 --> 36:44.125
I knew it
the moment Wade turned up at our door.

36:45.291 --> 36:49.958
God, they always make the most boring,
unimaginative moves possible, don't they?

36:51.250 --> 36:53.541
Trying to use your talent
to extract evidence?

36:54.375 --> 36:56.291
That just proves they've got nothing.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.625
You were brilliant, Luce,
by the way. Really.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.708
Can you stop the car, please?

37:08.666 --> 37:09.875
What are you doing?

37:12.083 --> 37:12.916
Leaving.

37:13.958 --> 37:14.958
I quit.

37:15.708 --> 37:16.833
Uh--

37:17.666 --> 37:18.750
Luce! Lucy!

37:19.375 --> 37:21.041
Can we talk about this in the car?

37:21.125 --> 37:23.958
-It's far too dangerous here.
-There's nothing to talk about.

37:24.041 --> 37:27.333
You wanted me fired anyway.
You only kept me on because I'm an asset.

37:27.416 --> 37:28.833
What? No. No, that's not true.

37:28.916 --> 37:31.000
-There's clearly been a misunderstanding.
-Funny, that.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.500
When you don't understand
anything about me.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.291
You haven't a clue what I'm going through.

37:37.375 --> 37:39.125
You couldn't care less,
if it gets you on TV.

37:39.208 --> 37:42.041
-I said I'm sorry about that.
-No, you haven't.

37:42.125 --> 37:46.166
Well, I am. And I am the one who tried
to stop this before it got too dangerous.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.416
Yeah, which just shows
how little you know.

37:48.958 --> 37:51.875
You might be able to turn your feelings
on and off like a tap,

37:51.958 --> 37:53.916
but I am drowning here, Lockwood.

37:54.416 --> 37:55.833
You know, sometimes, I just…

37:59.291 --> 38:01.125
I just think I'd be better off dead.

38:05.333 --> 38:06.541
I understand that.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.791
And it's not true, Lucy.

38:11.958 --> 38:12.833
We need you.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.791
And it's not because you're an asset.

38:17.708 --> 38:19.416
-Why, then?
-Because…

38:21.625 --> 38:22.541
because you're…

38:23.416 --> 38:24.416
Lucy Carlyle.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.291
We can't let you go.

38:27.750 --> 38:28.833
You have to.

38:29.666 --> 38:32.583
Barnes will shut you down.
He knows I'm illegal.

38:32.666 --> 38:34.500
That's why I went on TV, silly.

38:36.166 --> 38:40.208
Just to show Barnes
he can shove his threats. Screw the rules.

38:40.875 --> 38:43.458
They bend the rules all the time.
Why shouldn't we?

38:43.541 --> 38:45.916
I mean, why can't we change the rules?

38:46.916 --> 38:49.125
-Because we're nobodies.
-No, we're not.

38:49.708 --> 38:51.041
We're Lockwood & Co.

38:51.625 --> 38:53.583
You, me, and George.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.291
I'm sorry, Lucy.

38:59.250 --> 39:00.333
Please stay.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.625
Just never lie to me again.

39:05.916 --> 39:07.083
Swear it.

39:08.083 --> 39:10.583
I'll never lie to you again, I swear.

39:13.083 --> 39:14.375
Why did you light that?

39:15.458 --> 39:16.666
So you'd look cool?

39:16.750 --> 39:19.458
Because I can see five shades
and three lurkers closing in on us.

39:19.541 --> 39:21.750
-Are you lying?
-What did I just swear?

39:24.958 --> 39:26.375
Oh shit.

39:27.791 --> 39:30.166
Well, we are
right by Tyburn Gallows.

39:30.250 --> 39:32.208
It's the most haunted place in London.

39:32.833 --> 39:36.083
Frankly, you're more of a liability
than an asset, Lucy.

40:07.625 --> 40:10.125
Lockwood, something's wrong.

40:11.958 --> 40:14.750
It's bolted from the inside.

40:28.541 --> 40:29.875
What if it's Blake?

40:38.083 --> 40:39.416
Wait, Lockwood.

40:50.791 --> 40:51.875
I'll take him.

40:52.625 --> 40:53.708
You find George.

41:01.458 --> 41:04.166
Can I offer you a cup of tea
while you ransack my house?

41:04.666 --> 41:06.125
One lump or two?

41:16.083 --> 41:17.083
Fine.

41:18.250 --> 41:19.208
Have it your way.

41:20.291 --> 41:22.291
-Run.

41:35.166 --> 41:36.000
Help!

41:37.583 --> 41:39.541
Help! Help!

42:02.750 --> 42:04.833
Please, help me! Please!

42:06.375 --> 42:10.541
Oh, thank God. Hurry up, there's someone
here! There's someone upstairs!

42:11.333 --> 42:12.708
Glad you didn't get me fired?

42:13.666 --> 42:14.916
Please, untie me!

42:52.125 --> 42:54.708
Well, that was more exciting
than an early night.

42:54.791 --> 42:56.583
We should have people round more often.

42:56.666 --> 42:59.666
Who was it? Did he say anything?
Give anything away?

43:00.291 --> 43:02.541
No. But I know what he wanted.

43:07.750 --> 43:09.791
Hugo Blake must've found out
we had the ring.

43:09.875 --> 43:12.625
Sent that bastard to get it back
in case it linked us to the case.

43:12.708 --> 43:17.375
Maybe. Whoever it was,
this proves its value as evidence.

43:17.458 --> 43:20.166
Evidence we don't have anymore.
We're screwed.

43:21.375 --> 43:23.791
Every time we're ahead,
someone kicks us in the nuts

43:23.875 --> 43:25.208
and knocks us back down again.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.333
What? Why are you making that face?

43:31.333 --> 43:33.083
-What face?
-That face.

43:33.166 --> 43:36.166
That's not your normal face. That's your
"I know something you don't" face.

43:37.708 --> 43:40.000
Promise me you won't be angry.

43:40.083 --> 43:41.708
Why would we be angry?

43:44.583 --> 43:45.666
You haven't?

43:47.250 --> 43:48.083
You didn't?

43:50.125 --> 43:50.958
The ring?

43:51.625 --> 43:53.333
You lunatic!

43:58.208 --> 43:59.291
What the f--
