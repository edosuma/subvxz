WEBVTT

00:07.150 --> 00:08.020
- The ninja finals

00:07.250 --> 00:08.020
are back in OKC.

00:10.250 --> 00:14.070
- Yeah, Barclay!

00:10.250 --> 00:14.070
Get your shine on, girl!

00:14.070 --> 00:16.120
- Six weeks ago this town

00:16.120 --> 00:19.230
showed us the best

00:16.120 --> 00:19.230
the Old West had to offer.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.250
- OKC is pumpin'.

00:21.250 --> 00:25.260
- And our ninjas took things

00:21.250 --> 00:25.260
to a whole new frontier.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.260
- Yes!

00:26.260 --> 00:28.170
Okay, Karsten.

00:28.170 --> 00:32.140
- Yeah! Destroys it!

00:28.170 --> 00:32.140
- Whoo-hoo!

00:32.140 --> 00:34.210
- Tonight we're right back

00:34.210 --> 00:37.280
in front of the Oklahoma

00:34.210 --> 00:37.280
state capitol building

00:37.280 --> 00:39.250
with the city finalists

00:39.250 --> 00:41.170
looking to punch their tickets

00:41.170 --> 00:44.250
to the national finals

00:41.170 --> 00:44.250
in Las Vegas.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.170
Hello, everyone, and thanks

00:44.250 --> 00:47.170
for joining us once again.

00:47.170 --> 00:48.250
I'm Matt Iseman.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.100
- And I'm Akbar Gbajabiamila.

00:50.100 --> 00:53.000
Matt, they say there are horses

00:50.100 --> 00:53.000
for courses.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.280
Well, check it out.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.280
We got a horse for this course.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.070
It's a Clydesdale, and let me

00:55.280 --> 00:59.070
tell you, she is a beauty.

00:59.070 --> 01:01.060
- Well, this ain't our

00:59.070 --> 01:01.060
first rodeo here in OKC.

01:01.060 --> 01:04.120
A few weeks ago in qualifying

01:01.060 --> 01:04.120
we had some electrifying runs,

01:04.120 --> 01:05.250
some shocking endings,

01:05.250 --> 01:08.060
and a strong showing

01:05.250 --> 01:08.060
from our women with 4

01:08.060 --> 01:11.010
in the top 30 for only

01:08.060 --> 01:11.010
the second time in history.

01:11.010 --> 01:13.230
But now we're kicking it up

01:11.010 --> 01:13.230
a notch for the finals.

01:13.230 --> 01:16.010
For more on that,

01:13.230 --> 01:16.010
let's go down to Zuri Hall.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.210
- Thanks, guys.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.210
So the city finals course

01:18.210 --> 01:21.060
adds four more obstacles

01:18.210 --> 01:21.060
from qualifying,

01:21.060 --> 01:25.030
and that includes this

01:21.060 --> 01:25.030
brand-new one called Snapback.

01:25.030 --> 01:28.030
Our athletes will have to jump

01:25.030 --> 01:28.030
from the bar on the front

01:28.030 --> 01:31.260
to the one on the back,

01:28.030 --> 01:31.260
but it will snap back

01:31.260 --> 01:35.210
and create a moving target

01:31.260 --> 01:35.210
that'll be tough to grab,

01:35.210 --> 01:38.220
and they'll have to make

01:35.210 --> 01:38.220
that move twice.

01:38.220 --> 01:40.120
At the end of the night,

01:40.120 --> 01:43.210
the two fastest competitors

01:40.120 --> 01:43.210
face off on the Power Tower.

01:43.210 --> 01:46.170
The winner gets

01:43.210 --> 01:46.170
the coveted Safety Pass,

01:46.170 --> 01:48.210
which gives them a do-over

01:48.210 --> 01:51.150
on stage one or two

01:48.210 --> 01:51.150
at the national finals.

01:51.150 --> 01:55.060
That's an advantage that could

01:51.150 --> 01:55.060
be worth a million dollars.

01:55.060 --> 01:58.030
Guys, back to you.

01:58.030 --> 02:01.030
- Well, Daniel Gil took down

01:58.030 --> 02:01.030
the Power Tower in qualifying,

02:01.030 --> 02:02.150
winning that Speed Pass.

02:02.150 --> 02:04.200
The question is, can he do it

02:02.150 --> 02:04.200
again tonight, Akbar?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.260
- Well, he's definitely

02:04.200 --> 02:06.260
the favorite.

02:06.260 --> 02:10.060
The Houston worship leader

02:06.260 --> 02:10.060
was the fastest in qualifying

02:10.060 --> 02:12.250
and took down the Mega Wall,

02:10.060 --> 02:12.250
winning 10 grand.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.000
- Yes!

02:15.000 --> 02:16.210
- But pushing him will

02:15.000 --> 02:16.210
be his friend

02:16.210 --> 02:18.210
and protégé, Kid Owhadi.

02:18.210 --> 02:20.170
The 20-year-old

02:18.210 --> 02:20.170
college student

02:20.170 --> 02:22.130
is fast and fun to watch.

02:22.130 --> 02:24.000
- Oh, my goodness!

02:24.000 --> 02:26.090
- We also have a strong group

02:24.000 --> 02:26.090
of women

02:26.090 --> 02:28.280
led by former gymnast

02:26.090 --> 02:28.280
Barclay Stockett.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.210
- Wow, look at that.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.210
- Plus two super moms,

02:32.210 --> 02:37.110
Nebraska marketing consultant

02:32.210 --> 02:37.110
Maggi Thorne, and from Texas,

02:37.110 --> 02:41.000
physician assistant

02:37.110 --> 02:41.000
Karen Wiltin.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.250
- Got it!

02:44.250 --> 02:48.180
And our first competitor is

02:44.250 --> 02:48.180
gonna get this joint jumping.

02:48.180 --> 02:52.070
From Hiwasse, Arkansas,

02:48.180 --> 02:52.070
this is Jeff Harris,

02:52.070 --> 02:54.090
and with that vintage

02:52.070 --> 02:54.090
'70s outfit

02:54.090 --> 02:56.250
and the questionable

02:54.090 --> 02:56.250
dance moves,

02:56.250 --> 02:58.280
you may think he's

02:56.250 --> 02:58.280
from the Village People,

02:58.280 --> 03:01.030
but he's actually

02:58.280 --> 03:01.030
the Waste Warrior,

03:01.030 --> 03:03.250
and he's serious

03:01.030 --> 03:03.250
about recycling.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.080
- It's time to take out

03:07.050 --> 03:09.080
the trash.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.180
They call me

03:09.080 --> 03:10.180
the Waste Warrior,

03:10.180 --> 03:13.210
because I have a serious

03:10.180 --> 03:13.210
distaste for waste.

03:13.210 --> 03:15.240
- Thank you, Waste Warrior.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.030
- I own a dumpster company,

03:17.030 --> 03:19.120
and I see firsthand

03:17.030 --> 03:19.120
what excessive waste

03:19.120 --> 03:21.030
is doing to our planet.

03:21.030 --> 03:25.090
It is estimated that 75% of

03:21.030 --> 03:25.090
American waste is recyclable,

03:25.090 --> 03:28.150
but we only recycle 30%.

03:28.150 --> 03:30.190
Not groovy.

03:30.190 --> 03:33.190
Americans make more

03:30.190 --> 03:33.190
than 200 million tons

03:33.190 --> 03:35.090
of garbage a year.

03:35.090 --> 03:39.270
Frankly, if we recycled more,

03:35.090 --> 03:39.270
we could get out of this mess.

03:39.270 --> 03:43.250
Hey, kid,

03:39.270 --> 03:43.250
littering is for losers.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.090
- Thanks, Waste Warrior.

03:46.090 --> 03:50.180
- Would you like your Earth

03:46.090 --> 03:50.180
to look like that or this?

03:52.090 --> 03:56.210
Shrink that waste and make

03:52.090 --> 03:56.210
the world a better place.

03:59.190 --> 04:01.120
- Jeff out there

03:59.190 --> 04:01.120
saving the planet.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.220
Now can he conquer the course?

04:03.220 --> 04:04.250
- Well, he's got

04:03.220 --> 04:04.250
his wife Ashley

04:04.250 --> 04:07.060
and his son Kai

04:04.250 --> 04:07.060
on the sideline.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.250
- Hey, they're going with

04:07.060 --> 04:09.250
that retro look too.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.030
- And he's got lots of other

04:09.250 --> 04:12.030
waste warriors

04:12.030 --> 04:13.270
cheering him

04:12.030 --> 04:13.270
on from the stands.

04:13.270 --> 04:16.180
[countdown clock beeping]

04:16.180 --> 04:20.220
And Jeff Harris gets us off

04:16.180 --> 04:20.220
and running in OKC.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.000
He surprised us by hitting

04:22.120 --> 04:25.000
a buzzer in qualifying.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.120
Second obstacle here,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.120
the Wing Swing.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.190
- Oh, my goodness, he flew

04:28.120 --> 04:30.190
right through that

04:30.190 --> 04:33.070
in one move.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.050
- Now facing the Fly Wheels.

04:35.050 --> 04:37.070
- We had three wheels

04:35.050 --> 04:37.070
in qualifying

04:37.070 --> 04:38.250
but only two tonight.

04:38.250 --> 04:42.060
It's the same distance,

04:38.250 --> 04:42.060
so you need some big swings.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.200
- He's not slowing down.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.270
Harris is through.

04:46.270 --> 04:50.060
This guy 5'10",

04:46.270 --> 04:50.060
185, 38 years of age.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.120
Now taking on

04:50.060 --> 04:52.120
the dreaded Diving Boards.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.250
- Oh, oh, oh!

04:53.250 --> 04:56.150
Oh, he's doing the little

04:53.250 --> 04:56.150
surfboard action.

04:56.150 --> 04:59.000
- No one tried it

04:56.150 --> 04:59.000
this way in qualifying.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.040
- Those legs

04:59.000 --> 05:01.040
are like tree trunks.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.270
They're keeping him balanced.

05:02.270 --> 05:05.060
- Well, it worked,

05:02.270 --> 05:05.060
whatever it was.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.160
- That's the--that's

05:05.060 --> 05:06.160
the first time

05:06.160 --> 05:07.180
we've seen that technique.

05:07.180 --> 05:09.110
- That was an amazing

05:07.180 --> 05:09.110
adjustment there.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.250
- That's the first time

05:09.110 --> 05:10.250
we've seen that technique.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.060
I would have been scared

05:10.250 --> 05:12.060
to do that one.

05:12.060 --> 05:13.250
- I don't know

05:12.060 --> 05:13.250
how he saved it,

05:13.250 --> 05:17.180
but he's moving on and already

05:13.250 --> 05:17.180
taking on the Coconut Climb.

05:17.180 --> 05:21.020
Has to use that ring to go up

05:17.180 --> 05:21.020
and over these two trees.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.010
- Matt, this was a tough one

05:21.020 --> 05:23.010
in qualifying,

05:23.010 --> 05:25.060
knocked out

05:23.010 --> 05:25.060
almost 20 competitors.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.160
- Makes the reach

05:25.060 --> 05:27.160
over to the other side.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.190
He's moving quickly but have

05:27.160 --> 05:30.190
to be careful on this descent.

05:30.190 --> 05:33.250
- I think a lot of his power

05:30.190 --> 05:33.250
is coming from that 'stache.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.000
- Now has to get in position

05:33.250 --> 05:36.000
for the dismount.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.140
He needs to swing to his right

05:36.000 --> 05:38.140
and grab that rope.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.250
- He's got it

05:40.140 --> 05:41.250
and he's through.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.140
- Didn't even need the rope.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.050
- Yeah!

05:45.050 --> 05:48.100
- Well, he played high school

05:45.050 --> 05:48.100
football back in Arkansas,

05:48.100 --> 05:51.070
and he is rumbling

05:48.100 --> 05:51.070
through this course.

05:51.070 --> 05:54.070
all: Beat that wall!

05:51.070 --> 05:54.070
Beat that wall! Beat that wall!

05:54.070 --> 05:56.250
- He got up the Warped Wall

05:54.070 --> 05:56.250
in qualifying.

05:56.250 --> 06:00.110
Can he do it again?

06:00.110 --> 06:01.200
And right up it!

06:01.200 --> 06:04.000
[cheers and applause]

06:04.000 --> 06:05.260
- Whoo!

06:05.260 --> 06:07.200
- Now heading

06:05.260 --> 06:07.200
to the back half.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.020
Remember, only the top 12

06:07.200 --> 06:10.020
at the end of the night

06:10.020 --> 06:12.070
will move on

06:10.020 --> 06:12.070
to the national finals.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.200
You want to make it

06:12.070 --> 06:13.200
to at least

06:13.200 --> 06:14.230
the eighth or possibly

06:13.200 --> 06:14.230
the ninth obstacle

06:14.230 --> 06:16.100
to have a chance.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.070
- His son is cheering him on.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.140
He's got the mustache on too.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.250
- Looking sharp,

06:21.250 --> 06:23.160
but these final four obstacles

06:21.250 --> 06:23.160
are brutal.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.180
Up first for Harris,

06:23.160 --> 06:26.180
the Salmon Ladder.

06:26.180 --> 06:29.070
- All right, here we go,

06:26.180 --> 06:29.070
all about technique.

06:29.070 --> 06:32.000
- Gotta go up four rungs.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.070
- Ooh.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.070
- Uneven!

06:33.070 --> 06:35.110
- Keep your Ls.

06:33.070 --> 06:35.110
Nice.

06:35.110 --> 06:37.100
- He's completed

06:35.110 --> 06:37.100
the Salmon Ladder

06:37.100 --> 06:40.010
and now will reach over

06:37.100 --> 06:40.010
to start the eighth obstacle,

06:40.010 --> 06:41.200
the Crazy Clocks.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.170
Has to force those clock

06:41.200 --> 06:44.170
handles to the other side,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.000
just like that.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.060
And now has to swing

06:46.000 --> 06:48.060
to the board in the middle.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.070
Got it.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.070
Jeff Harris,

06:50.070 --> 06:53.090
an improbable run out of

06:50.070 --> 06:53.090
the 38-year-old retro ninja.

06:53.090 --> 06:54.190
- Ooh, okay.

06:53.090 --> 06:54.190
- And this is where

06:54.190 --> 06:56.140
those arms start to get

06:54.190 --> 06:56.140
a little jiggly-tired.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.250
- But Harris on

06:56.140 --> 06:58.250
to the second clock.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.120
- And these clock hands

06:58.250 --> 07:01.120
are even harder to turn.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.040
They're on an incline.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.240
- But Jeff Harris just

07:03.040 --> 07:05.240
powering his way through.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.070
Going for the dismount,

07:05.240 --> 07:08.070
and he's done it!

07:08.070 --> 07:11.060
[cheers and applause]

07:11.060 --> 07:13.120
- Matt, we get ninjas

07:11.060 --> 07:13.120
from all over.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.020
This guy's a 38-year-old

07:15.020 --> 07:17.000
who works

07:15.020 --> 07:17.000
in the dumpster business,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.020
and he is destroying

07:17.000 --> 07:19.020
this course.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.220
all: Fear the 'stache!

07:19.020 --> 07:20.220
Fear the 'stache!

07:20.220 --> 07:23.120
- The crowd chanting

07:20.220 --> 07:23.120
"Fear the 'stache!"

07:23.120 --> 07:24.250
as Harris steps up

07:24.250 --> 07:27.140
to take on this new obstacle,

07:24.250 --> 07:27.140
Snapback.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.290
Here's how this works.

07:28.290 --> 07:31.220
He's gotta jump from

07:28.290 --> 07:31.220
that front bar to the back,

07:31.220 --> 07:33.230
and that whole apparatus

07:31.220 --> 07:33.230
will shift on him.

07:33.230 --> 07:37.020
It's like hitting

07:33.230 --> 07:37.020
a moving target.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.120
Oh, my!

07:37.020 --> 07:38.120
- Oh, my goodness.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.090
He barely made that one, Matt.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.090
- Come on.

07:40.090 --> 07:42.000
- He's gotta do that one again

07:40.090 --> 07:42.000
but be cleaner.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.140
- No!

07:42.000 --> 07:44.140
- Oh!

07:44.140 --> 07:46.120
[together]

07:44.140 --> 07:46.120
Oh!

07:46.120 --> 07:48.290
- The Waste Warrior

07:46.120 --> 07:48.290
finally hits the water,

07:48.290 --> 07:50.180
but he reaches

07:48.290 --> 07:50.180
the ninth obstacle,

07:50.180 --> 07:52.060
and that could be enough

07:50.180 --> 07:52.060
to get him

07:52.060 --> 07:54.040
to the national finals.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.180
- This dumpster dude

07:54.040 --> 07:56.180
was impressive.

07:56.180 --> 07:59.060
He powered through

07:56.180 --> 07:59.060
the Crazy Clocks with ease,

07:59.060 --> 08:01.000
but Snapback is tricky.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.070
You gotta throw your body

08:01.000 --> 08:03.070
into space

08:03.070 --> 08:05.010
and try to catch that bar.

08:05.010 --> 08:08.110
He got the first one

08:05.010 --> 08:08.110
but got dumped on the second.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.200
- Saddle up, buckaroo,

08:11.200 --> 08:15.000
'cause it's gonna be

08:11.200 --> 08:15.000
a big showdown in OKC.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.200
We've got Big Dogs, Big Kats,

08:18.200 --> 08:22.020
and big names

08:18.200 --> 08:22.020
all gunning for Vegas.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.130
- On the count of three.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.250
- Plus some hotshot rookies

08:26.000 --> 08:30.250
ready to make a splash.

08:30.250 --> 08:34.240
Five women reached the

08:30.250 --> 08:34.240
fifth obstacle in qualifying.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.039
Who's getting up

08:34.240 --> 08:37.039
the wall tonight?

08:37.039 --> 08:38.270
- Oh, yeah!

08:37.039 --> 08:38.270
- So close.

08:38.270 --> 08:41.220
- And Barclay Stockett's

08:38.270 --> 08:41.220
taking the ninja spirit

08:41.220 --> 08:42.280
across the globe.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.000
all: Barclay! Barclay! Barclay!

08:42.280 --> 08:46.000
Barclay!

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
- It's gonna be a wild night

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
in Oklahoma

08:49.000 --> 08:52.160
on "American Ninja Warrior."

08:56.050 --> 08:56.070
.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.000
- Welcome back to

08:59.170 --> 09:00.000
"American Ninja Warrior"

09:01.020 --> 09:03.120
and the Oklahoma City finals.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.050
After tonight we'll head to

09:03.120 --> 09:07.050
Seattle-Tacoma, Baltimore,

09:07.050 --> 09:11.070
and then Cincinnati as we work

09:07.050 --> 09:11.070
our way to the national finals

09:11.070 --> 09:12.240
in Las Vegas,

09:12.240 --> 09:17.010
where one of our athletes

09:12.240 --> 09:17.010
could win a million dollars.

09:17.010 --> 09:18.160
Well, our next competitor

09:18.160 --> 09:20.100
is looking to secure

09:18.160 --> 09:20.100
her second trip

09:20.100 --> 09:21.270
to the national finals.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.160
Zuri, start the introductions.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.120
- When you see

09:23.160 --> 09:25.120
this many pink bows,

09:25.120 --> 09:27.000
you know

09:25.120 --> 09:27.000
who's about to hit the course.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.090
Tell them, everyone.

09:28.090 --> 09:30.150
all: Maggi Thorne!

09:30.150 --> 09:32.200
- That's right.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.200
It's Maggi Thorne,

09:32.200 --> 09:34.210
and the Nebraska

09:32.200 --> 09:34.210
marketing consultant

09:34.210 --> 09:37.120
is at the start line

09:34.210 --> 09:37.120
with her three kids.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.120
They're putting that trademark

09:37.120 --> 09:40.120
pink bow in her hair.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.010
Maggi's one of the many strong

09:40.120 --> 09:43.010
women in "Ninja Warrior"

09:43.010 --> 09:45.000
who balance career, kids,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.170
and training

09:45.000 --> 09:48.170
and somehow makes it all work.

09:51.130 --> 09:52.140
- [screams]

09:52.140 --> 09:54.140
- Oof!

09:52.140 --> 09:54.140
- Let's go!

09:54.140 --> 09:56.170
- As a single mom,

09:54.140 --> 09:56.170
I juggle a lot,

09:56.170 --> 10:01.000
between sports, dance lessons,

09:56.170 --> 10:01.000
dentists, doctors.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.270
It is hard to figure out

10:01.000 --> 10:02.270
what I s--

10:02.270 --> 10:06.010
- Mom, I want a snack.

10:02.270 --> 10:06.010
- [laughs]

10:06.010 --> 10:08.250
Okay, get a snack, hon.

10:06.010 --> 10:08.250
- All right...

10:08.250 --> 10:11.030
- That's my life.

10:11.030 --> 10:15.040
- ♪ I keep fighting voices

10:11.030 --> 10:15.040
in my mind ♪

10:15.040 --> 10:19.140
♪ That say I'm not enough ♪

10:19.140 --> 10:20.210
- Finding the time to train,

10:20.210 --> 10:22.200
I have to be

10:20.210 --> 10:22.200
really disciplined.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.020
Ready?

10:24.020 --> 10:27.110
- ♪ Every single lie

10:24.020 --> 10:27.110
that tells me ♪

10:27.110 --> 10:32.250
♪ I will never measure up ♪

10:32.250 --> 10:35.110
- I have felt like

10:32.250 --> 10:35.110
I've had something to prove

10:35.110 --> 10:39.000
on "American Ninja Warrior"

10:35.110 --> 10:39.000
for a long time.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.050
The Warped Wall is something

10:39.000 --> 10:41.050
I've thought about

10:41.050 --> 10:45.020
from the very first time

10:41.050 --> 10:45.020
I competed five years ago.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.130
- ♪ Ooh oh ♪

10:47.130 --> 10:50.140
♪ You say I am loved ♪

10:50.140 --> 10:53.270

10:56.260 --> 11:00.260
♪ When I think I am weak ♪

11:00.260 --> 11:05.050
- Getting up that wall

11:00.260 --> 11:05.050
would mean so much

11:05.050 --> 11:06.230
not just for me

11:06.230 --> 11:09.200
but for every single mom,

11:06.230 --> 11:09.200
for every little girl,

11:09.200 --> 11:12.030
for my little girls,

11:09.200 --> 11:12.030
for my son.

11:12.030 --> 11:15.070
- ♪ And I believe ♪

11:15.070 --> 11:18.020
♪ Oh I believe ♪

11:18.020 --> 11:20.160
- It's gonna be a breakthrough

11:18.020 --> 11:20.160
for everybody

11:20.160 --> 11:23.010
who has joined me

11:20.160 --> 11:23.010
on this journey.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.070
- Maggi's kids have made it

11:26.250 --> 11:29.070
over to the sideline,

11:29.070 --> 11:31.200
where they've joined

11:29.070 --> 11:31.200
ninja greats Drew Drechsel,

11:31.200 --> 11:34.040
Grant McCartney,

11:31.200 --> 11:34.040
and Barclay Stockett.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.270
Plus, Jessie Graff

11:34.040 --> 11:36.270
is watching on FaceTime.

11:36.270 --> 11:38.120
She and Maggi were teammates

11:38.120 --> 11:40.240
on the University

11:38.120 --> 11:40.240
of Nebraska track team.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.080
[countdown clock beeping]

11:43.080 --> 11:45.010
- And she ran sprints

11:43.080 --> 11:45.010
at Nebraska,

11:45.010 --> 11:46.150
so she's got

11:45.010 --> 11:46.150
that get-out speed.

11:46.150 --> 11:50.170
I expect her to run across

11:46.150 --> 11:50.170
these Shrinking Steps.

11:50.170 --> 11:52.190
- Maggi's one of

11:50.170 --> 11:52.190
the five women who made it to

11:52.190 --> 11:54.160
the fifth obstacle

11:52.190 --> 11:54.160
in qualifying.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.120
The top two women tonight

11:56.120 --> 11:58.050
will move on to

11:56.120 --> 11:58.050
the national finals,

11:58.050 --> 12:00.040
and with so many

11:58.050 --> 12:00.040
strong competitors,

12:00.040 --> 12:02.100
you're gonna need to get

12:00.040 --> 12:02.100
far on this course.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.260
Long transition

12:02.100 --> 12:03.260
on the Wing Swing.

12:03.260 --> 12:05.080
Nice lache.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.280
- Ooh, that was a crazy lache,

12:05.080 --> 12:07.280
but she made it.

12:09.190 --> 12:12.030
- Taking a couple extra swings

12:09.190 --> 12:12.030
here on the Wing Swing,

12:12.030 --> 12:13.130
but she's through.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.280
- That's my mom!

12:13.130 --> 12:14.280
[cheers and applause]

12:14.280 --> 12:16.170
- Never give up is her motto.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.250
She's never made it past the

12:16.170 --> 12:18.250
fifth obstacle in competition.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.230
Right now taking

12:18.250 --> 12:20.230
on the Fly Wheels.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.250
- And you know Maggi Thorne

12:20.230 --> 12:22.250
is committed.

12:22.250 --> 12:25.120
With her marketing job

12:22.250 --> 12:25.120
and taking care of kids,

12:25.120 --> 12:27.270
she sometimes trains at 1:00

12:25.120 --> 12:27.270
or 2:00 in the morning.

12:27.270 --> 12:30.270
- Oh, nearly hit her face

12:27.270 --> 12:30.270
on that second Fly Wheel.

12:30.270 --> 12:32.100
- That was a close call.

12:32.100 --> 12:36.160
- Was somehow able to hold on.

12:36.160 --> 12:40.030
Maggi Thorne survives.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.220
Let's see if that track star

12:41.220 --> 12:43.160
has the balance

12:41.220 --> 12:43.160
on the Diving Boards.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.120
Thorne needs

12:43.160 --> 12:45.120
to have sure footing here.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.080
both: Ooh!

12:48.080 --> 12:49.120
- No, no, hold on!

12:49.120 --> 12:50.260
- What a save!

12:50.260 --> 12:52.040
- Hold on!

12:52.040 --> 12:53.160
- And a hard impact.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.250
You can see,

12:53.160 --> 12:54.250
got on the front side

12:54.250 --> 12:56.210
of that first board.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.210
- Oh, my goodness.

12:56.210 --> 12:59.090
- Trying to balance herself

12:56.210 --> 12:59.090
on that wobbly board.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.200
It's only 10 inches wide.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.200
And you can see her really

13:01.200 --> 13:04.200
just controlling the board

13:04.200 --> 13:06.010
and using the balance.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.010
- Oh, my goodness.

13:06.010 --> 13:07.160
That might be the best save of

13:06.010 --> 13:07.160
the night.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.020
- This could be the save

13:07.160 --> 13:09.020
of the night without a doubt.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.100
- You talk

13:09.020 --> 13:10.100
about a breakthrough.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.250
- Come on!

13:11.250 --> 13:14.130
And her heart

13:11.250 --> 13:14.130
has to be racing.

13:14.130 --> 13:17.010
[cheers and applause]

13:17.010 --> 13:19.010
She really took

13:17.010 --> 13:19.010
an impact there.

13:19.010 --> 13:21.040
- Yeah, Matt, she's a little

13:19.010 --> 13:21.040
discombobulated right now.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.170
She hit it hard.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.170
Check this out.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.200
She stepped on the front

13:23.170 --> 13:25.200
of that first board,

13:25.200 --> 13:27.000
and it tripped her up,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.140
and she went face-first

13:27.000 --> 13:30.140
into that third one.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.140
- Still looks a bit shaken up,

13:32.140 --> 13:34.000
but Maggi is gonna continue.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.220
- There's nothing you can't do!

13:35.220 --> 13:37.270
You can do anything, Maggi!

13:35.220 --> 13:37.270
Come on!

13:37.270 --> 13:39.070
- And you can see she's got

13:39.070 --> 13:41.050
a little cut

13:39.070 --> 13:41.050
right underneath her eye.

13:41.050 --> 13:42.220
- Come on!

13:41.050 --> 13:42.220
- Go, Maggi!

13:42.220 --> 13:44.080
- Come on!

13:44.080 --> 13:46.100
- But now it's the one

13:44.080 --> 13:46.100
obstacle she couldn't get past

13:46.100 --> 13:49.040
in qualifying, Coconut Climb,

13:49.040 --> 13:52.200
made it to almost to the end,

13:49.040 --> 13:52.200
but her arms gave out.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.050
Maggi Thorne, and talk about

13:52.200 --> 13:56.050
never giving up,

13:56.050 --> 13:57.200
took a blow to the face,

13:57.200 --> 14:00.190
and she's still fighting

13:57.200 --> 14:00.190
to get to that Warped Wall.

14:00.190 --> 14:04.030
- That is just amazing,

14:00.190 --> 14:04.030
and she is getting close.

14:04.030 --> 14:06.090
Now, a few weeks ago

14:04.030 --> 14:06.090
in the Tacoma Dome

14:06.090 --> 14:09.200
we saw Sandy Zimmerman become

14:06.090 --> 14:09.200
the first mom up the wall.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.190
Maggi Thorne could be

14:09.200 --> 14:11.190
the second.

14:11.190 --> 14:13.000
There it is.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.220
- Yeah, shake it off. I know.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.220
I know it hurts.

14:15.220 --> 14:18.000
- You got it, reach!

14:18.000 --> 14:21.030
- And a good job there

14:18.000 --> 14:21.030
on that backswing.

14:21.030 --> 14:22.120
- She's showing her daughters

14:22.120 --> 14:23.260
exactly

14:22.120 --> 14:23.260
how to fight through it.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.090
- But this is where she got

14:23.260 --> 14:25.090
hung up

14:25.090 --> 14:28.070
in qualifying,

14:25.090 --> 14:28.070
couldn't get over this cleat.

14:28.070 --> 14:31.240
- Come on, Maggi. Hold on!

14:28.070 --> 14:31.240
- But gets it tonight!

14:31.240 --> 14:33.020
- And you are tough.

14:33.020 --> 14:35.200
- Now only a few feet

14:33.020 --> 14:35.200
from her dream,

14:35.200 --> 14:38.200
the Warped Wall.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.200
Can she hang on?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.130
- She's in a zone, Matt.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.130
She's in a zone.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.210
She's in a zone!

14:41.210 --> 14:43.030
- Oh, my!

14:41.210 --> 14:43.030
- She's in a zone!

14:43.030 --> 14:44.260
- And the first time ever,

14:44.260 --> 14:46.240
Maggi Thorne's gonna attempt

14:44.260 --> 14:46.240
the Warped Wall,

14:46.240 --> 14:49.080
and she's overcome

14:46.240 --> 14:49.080
with emotion.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.090
- Oh, my goodness!

14:51.090 --> 14:52.120
- Yes!

14:52.120 --> 14:53.260
- That is remarkable.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.260
- Yeah.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.100
- Talk about never giving up.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.100
She is walking the walk

14:57.100 --> 14:59.010
on the course

14:57.100 --> 14:59.010
in front of her kids.

14:59.010 --> 15:01.130
all: Beat that wall!

14:59.010 --> 15:01.130
Beat that wall!

15:01.130 --> 15:03.250
- She got beat up a little bit

15:01.130 --> 15:03.250
by the Diving Board,

15:03.250 --> 15:05.050
and now she's

15:03.250 --> 15:05.050
at the Warped Wall.

15:05.050 --> 15:06.220
This is great.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.120
- But you can see the bruise

15:06.220 --> 15:08.120
already developing

15:08.120 --> 15:09.200
underneath her eyes,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.050
but she will not quit.

15:11.050 --> 15:12.190
This is her dream.

15:12.190 --> 15:16.050
She would be the second mom

15:12.190 --> 15:16.050
ever to do this.

15:16.050 --> 15:17.250
Do not discount this woman.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.020
- I'm putting on my bow tie.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.020
- Yes!

15:19.020 --> 15:23.050
- I got my bow tie on.

15:19.020 --> 15:23.050
Yes! Yes! Yes!

15:23.050 --> 15:26.030
- Yes!

15:23.050 --> 15:26.030
- Yeah!

15:26.030 --> 15:29.130
- I see you!

15:29.130 --> 15:32.080
- Maggi Thorne joins

15:29.130 --> 15:32.080
Sandy Zimmerman

15:32.080 --> 15:34.270
in the moms up

15:32.080 --> 15:34.270
the Warped Wall club.

15:34.270 --> 15:37.240
- That's that mama strength

15:34.270 --> 15:37.240
right there, mama strong.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.210
all: Maggi! Maggi! Maggi!

15:37.240 --> 15:41.210
Maggi! Maggi!

15:41.210 --> 15:43.010
- And look at her.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.200
She looks like a boxer

15:43.010 --> 15:45.200
who went ten rounds,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.270
but her motto

15:45.200 --> 15:47.270
is never give up.

15:47.270 --> 15:50.230
- Maggi actually used to be

15:47.270 --> 15:50.230
an amateur boxer.

15:50.230 --> 15:53.010
She is a fighter,

15:50.230 --> 15:53.010
and now she's gonna keep

15:53.010 --> 15:56.040
this magical run going

15:53.010 --> 15:56.040
on the Salmon Ladder.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.120
What does she have left?

15:58.120 --> 15:59.210
- She's fighting back.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.230
- Has to jump this bar up

15:59.210 --> 16:01.230
four rungs.

16:01.230 --> 16:03.080
- There you go.

16:01.230 --> 16:03.080
- And look at her!

16:03.080 --> 16:06.170
Maggi Thorne thundering

16:03.080 --> 16:06.170
through the Salmon Ladder,

16:06.170 --> 16:08.280
and she's reached the top,

16:08.280 --> 16:12.000
and now gonna reach over

16:08.280 --> 16:12.000
to start the Crazy Clocks.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.150
- Her kids have gotta be

16:12.000 --> 16:14.150
so proud.

16:14.150 --> 16:17.170
Fiona, Ellie, and Charlie

16:14.150 --> 16:17.170
are on the sideline

16:17.170 --> 16:20.170
losing their absolute mind.

16:17.170 --> 16:20.170
They are proud of their mama.

16:20.170 --> 16:23.270
- By far the best run in her

16:20.170 --> 16:23.270
five-year ninja career.

16:23.270 --> 16:26.010
How much farther can she go?

16:26.010 --> 16:27.220
And struggling

16:26.010 --> 16:27.220
to get those hands forward.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.070
- Come on, mama.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.070
- Turn the clock!

16:29.070 --> 16:31.110
- Oh!

16:29.070 --> 16:31.110
- Aw.

16:31.110 --> 16:34.000
- Ohh.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.250
- Time runs out for

16:34.000 --> 16:35.250
Maggi Thorne

16:35.250 --> 16:37.280
but not before the best

16:35.250 --> 16:37.280
run of her career.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.090
She proved something tonight.

16:39.090 --> 16:40.240
- That's right, Matt.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.230
The course hit her hard,

16:40.240 --> 16:43.230
and Maggi Thorne fought back.

16:44.220 --> 16:48.070
Look again at the shot she

16:44.220 --> 16:48.070
took on Diving Boards,

16:48.070 --> 16:51.050
but she hung on,

16:48.070 --> 16:51.050
got back up,

16:51.050 --> 16:53.250
and fought her way up

16:51.050 --> 16:53.250
the Warped Wall,

16:53.250 --> 16:56.150
the second mom

16:53.250 --> 16:56.150
in history to do it.

16:56.150 --> 17:00.040
Her arms finally gave out

16:56.150 --> 17:00.040
on the Crazy Clocks,

17:00.040 --> 17:02.250
but she has set the bar

17:00.040 --> 17:02.250
high for the women.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.240
- Let's go down to Zuri.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.109
- Maggi, you had the ultimate

17:04.240 --> 17:08.109
save on the Diving Boards.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.210
- I wish I could tell you

17:09.210 --> 17:12.000
I knew how it happened

17:09.210 --> 17:12.000
besides God being like,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.079
"Girl, I'm gonna make sure

17:12.000 --> 17:14.079
you get through."

17:14.079 --> 17:15.280
I was like, "Okay."

17:15.280 --> 17:18.069
- And that He did, 'cause

17:15.280 --> 17:18.069
you definitely found a way.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.000
You looked like you were about

17:18.069 --> 17:20.000
to explode at the top

17:20.000 --> 17:21.250
of the Warped Wall, so excited.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.079
How did that feel for you,

17:21.250 --> 17:23.079
that moment?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.230
- Oh, my gosh,

17:24.230 --> 17:27.109
I have waited for that moment

17:24.230 --> 17:27.109
for so long, and I got it!

17:27.109 --> 17:28.270
- Congratulations.

17:28.270 --> 17:30.170
We're gonna see if you went

17:28.270 --> 17:30.170
far enough fast enough

17:30.170 --> 17:31.210
to make it to

17:30.170 --> 17:31.210
the national finals.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.070
Great job out there.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.250
- The West Texas Ninja,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.250
Tyler Humphrey,

18:26.250 --> 18:29.190
had a rough ride

18:26.250 --> 18:29.190

- You good? The adrenaline

18:29.190 --> 18:32.070
is pumping for him.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.210
- The artist from Lubbock

18:36.000 --> 18:37.190

18:37.190 --> 18:41.000
- The two-time ninja veteran

18:37.190 --> 18:41.000
had a checklist on his back,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.130
including

18:41.000 --> 18:43.130
conquering the Salmon Ladder,

18:43.130 --> 18:44.240
where he fell last year.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.000
both: Got it.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.250
- But once that was

18:46.000 --> 18:47.250
off his list,

18:47.250 --> 18:50.110
he had nothing left

18:47.250 --> 18:50.110

26:30.170 --> 26:32.250
This devious obstacle came

26:30.170 --> 26:32.250
from last year's

26:32.250 --> 26:34.220
obstacle design challenge,

26:34.220 --> 26:36.090
and we're doing it

26:34.220 --> 26:36.090
again this year.

26:36.090 --> 26:40.010
If you've got an idea,

26:36.090 --> 26:40.010
go to ANWNation.com.

26:40.010 --> 26:44.000
You might see your creation

26:40.010 --> 26:44.000
on the course next year.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.240
- And Karsten's using

26:44.000 --> 26:45.240
his longer arms

26:45.240 --> 26:47.140
and muscling his way

26:45.240 --> 26:47.140
through this.

26:47.140 --> 26:49.030
Well, and that's

26:47.140 --> 26:49.030
the one thing you want to do,

26:49.030 --> 26:51.190
especially on Coconut Climb,

26:49.030 --> 26:51.190
use the length.

26:51.190 --> 26:52.250
- Working at the ninja gym

26:52.250 --> 26:55.070
every day clearly

26:52.250 --> 26:55.070
has helped his training,

26:55.070 --> 26:56.270
and using that long frame.

26:56.270 --> 26:58.200
- And there's an advantage

26:56.270 --> 26:58.200
when you're that long,

26:58.200 --> 27:00.110
'cause you should be able

26:58.200 --> 27:00.110
to generate and get off.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.240
- Good job.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.240
- Great job.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.270
[cheers and applause]

27:02.270 --> 27:04.090
- Karsten through it,

27:04.090 --> 27:06.060
the fastest we've seen

27:04.090 --> 27:06.060
anyone to this point.

27:06.060 --> 27:09.170
- Okay, Fast Kat.

27:06.060 --> 27:09.170
- Go, you got it. You got it.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.030
- Well, he ran up

27:09.170 --> 27:11.030
the 18-foot

27:11.030 --> 27:14.160
Mega Wall in qualifying,

27:11.030 --> 27:14.160
so this 14 1/2-foot wall

27:14.160 --> 27:15.260
shouldn't be a problem,

27:15.260 --> 27:18.040
and the Big Kat scampers

27:15.260 --> 27:18.040
right up it.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.180
Karsten Williams

27:18.040 --> 27:20.180
making great time on that.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.270
- And, Matt, this next

27:20.180 --> 27:22.270
obstacle, the Salmon Ladder,

27:22.270 --> 27:24.100
this is his bread and butter.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.170
We've seen this dude crush

27:24.100 --> 27:26.170
the Super Salmon Ladder

27:26.170 --> 27:28.000
in our skills competition.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.070
He jumped up 35 rungs,

27:30.070 --> 27:32.000
so you know

27:30.070 --> 27:32.000
he can handle four.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.170
- And he hasn't even stopped

27:34.240 --> 27:37.170
to take a breath yet.

27:37.170 --> 27:40.010
- And he's gonna go fast.

27:43.010 --> 27:45.020
- Ooh!

27:43.010 --> 27:45.020
- He skipped a rung.

27:45.020 --> 27:46.170
- Oh, okay.

27:45.020 --> 27:46.170
Excuse me.

27:46.170 --> 27:48.210
He said, "Ain't nobody

27:46.170 --> 27:48.210
got time for this."

27:48.210 --> 27:50.240
- Well, that's one way

27:48.210 --> 27:50.240
to save some seconds.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.110
- Hold on, son.

27:52.110 --> 27:56.270
At the Crazy Clocks, at 170

27:52.110 --> 27:56.270
pounds it's a bigger ask.

27:56.270 --> 28:00.030
- Yeah, you can see somebody's

27:56.270 --> 28:00.030
been in that weight room.

28:00.030 --> 28:02.050
Matt, he is rushing through

28:00.030 --> 28:02.050
Crazy Clocks.

28:02.050 --> 28:03.170
He's not fooling around.

28:03.170 --> 28:07.230
- We've seen several ninjas

28:03.170 --> 28:07.230
fall right here,

28:07.230 --> 28:09.250
but this one,

28:07.230 --> 28:09.250
it's a 5-degree incline,

28:09.250 --> 28:11.030
a little more challenging

28:09.250 --> 28:11.030
for the big boy.

28:11.030 --> 28:12.240
- Yeah--

28:11.030 --> 28:12.240
- Got it!

28:12.240 --> 28:15.250
- Nice. He got that

28:12.240 --> 28:15.250
almost at 6:30, nice.

28:15.250 --> 28:19.040
- The Big Kat just crushed

28:15.250 --> 28:19.040
the Crazy Clocks,

28:19.040 --> 28:21.090
but now the ninth obstacle.

28:21.090 --> 28:24.030
And this is

28:21.090 --> 28:24.030
where he's been cursed.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.280
Back in season seven, it was

28:24.030 --> 28:26.280
the Crazy Cliffhanger...

28:28.250 --> 28:30.150
[buzzer blares]

28:30.150 --> 28:32.180
In season eight,

28:30.150 --> 28:32.180
the Window Hang...

28:34.060 --> 28:35.200
[buzzer blares]

28:35.200 --> 28:38.030
And season nine,

28:35.200 --> 28:38.030
Spinball Wizard.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.200
[buzzer blares]

28:41.200 --> 28:43.240
The ninth obstacle has been

28:41.200 --> 28:43.240
a big roadblock

28:43.240 --> 28:45.140
for the big Kat.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.230
- That's right, Matt.

28:46.230 --> 28:48.180
And nobody has been able

28:46.230 --> 28:48.180
to get through it.

28:48.180 --> 28:50.240
This Snapback is a killer.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.230
- Has to jump over

28:50.240 --> 28:53.230
to that other bar,

28:53.230 --> 28:55.130
and it's a moving target.

28:55.130 --> 28:57.180
All right, here we go.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.270
- Nice.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.270
- Got it.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.050
A little confused

28:58.270 --> 29:01.050
on how to handle this.

29:01.050 --> 29:02.260
It's a brand-new obstacle.

29:02.260 --> 29:05.060
Gotta get over to

29:02.260 --> 29:05.060
the next handle.

29:05.060 --> 29:08.190
Got it! Can he break through

29:05.060 --> 29:08.190
on the ninth obstacle?

29:08.190 --> 29:09.270
- So he's gotta go for it

29:08.190 --> 29:09.270
right now.

29:09.270 --> 29:11.170
Don't let the fatigue set in.

29:09.270 --> 29:11.170
Nice!

29:11.170 --> 29:13.090
Did you see that hang time

29:11.170 --> 29:13.090
he had there?

29:13.090 --> 29:17.100
- And he's gonna do it!

29:13.090 --> 29:17.100
The curse is over.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.190
[cheers and applause]

29:19.190 --> 29:21.240
- This crowd is going nuts!

29:21.240 --> 29:24.170
- 35 feet away

29:21.240 --> 29:24.170
from punching his ticket

29:24.170 --> 29:26.250
and a guaranteed spot

29:24.170 --> 29:26.250
to Vegas.

29:26.250 --> 29:30.100
Hasn't hit a city finals

29:26.250 --> 29:30.100
buzzer in five years.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.270
You know how much

29:30.100 --> 29:31.270
this would mean to him.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.040
- 35 feet to glory.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.130
- Oh, my, flying up it.

29:36.130 --> 29:38.010
- This is it.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.180
This is your time.

29:39.180 --> 29:42.210
- He's really using

29:39.180 --> 29:42.210
his lower body well.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.030
- Oh, he is.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.030
You can tell he's feeling it.

29:44.030 --> 29:45.190
Okay, Karsten!

29:45.190 --> 29:48.000
- And still moving so fast.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.010
- We could see the Big Kat

29:48.000 --> 29:51.010
on the Power Tower.

29:51.010 --> 29:53.000
He's gonna have a fast time.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.140
- And the Big Kat

29:53.000 --> 29:56.140
has come up big.

29:56.140 --> 29:59.040
- He's a Fast Kat!

29:59.040 --> 30:02.070
[cheers and applause]

30:07.180 --> 30:09.250
- It's been five years,

30:07.180 --> 30:09.250
and Karsten Williams

30:09.250 --> 30:13.040
gets a buzzer

30:09.250 --> 30:13.040
in the city finals course,

30:13.040 --> 30:15.240
and he's our first finisher

30:13.040 --> 30:15.240
of the night.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.000
- Ahh! Yeah!

30:18.000 --> 30:20.040
- Yeah!

30:20.040 --> 30:23.080
- Look at them.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.080
They're going absolutely nuts!

30:23.080 --> 30:25.130
- Finally gets past

30:23.080 --> 30:25.130
the ninth obstacle

30:25.130 --> 30:27.210
to hit a city finals buzzer

30:27.210 --> 30:31.110
in just under 4 1/2 minutes.

30:31.110 --> 30:34.150
- Check out this perfect

30:31.110 --> 30:34.150
technique on Snapback,

30:34.150 --> 30:37.030
has to make a reverse catch

30:34.150 --> 30:37.030
with his hands,

30:37.030 --> 30:40.000
and he does it,

30:37.030 --> 30:40.000
and look at his face.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.270
He knew he was gonna

30:40.000 --> 30:41.270
get through,

30:41.270 --> 30:43.210
and then powered his way up

30:43.210 --> 30:45.190
the Spider Trap

30:43.210 --> 30:45.190
to hit the buzzer.

30:45.190 --> 30:49.030
The Big Kat is going back

30:45.190 --> 30:49.030
to the national finals.

30:49.030 --> 30:50.110
- Let's go down to Zuri.

30:50.110 --> 30:53.050
- Karsten, congratulations.

30:53.050 --> 30:55.040
Oh, my gosh,

30:53.050 --> 30:55.040
that was absolutely amazing.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.270
The Big Kat is back,

30:56.270 --> 30:58.220
five years

30:56.270 --> 30:58.220
since you hit a buzzer

30:58.220 --> 31:00.200
at city finals.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.200
How did that feel?

31:00.200 --> 31:03.030
- It feels amazing.

31:00.200 --> 31:03.030
It feels amazing.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.110
[cheers and applause]

31:05.110 --> 31:06.250
- Yeah!

31:06.250 --> 31:08.100
- It felt so good doing it

31:06.250 --> 31:08.100
for the people

31:08.100 --> 31:09.180
that I love and care about.

31:09.180 --> 31:10.270
- Yeah.

31:10.270 --> 31:12.280
- And this is the best day

31:10.270 --> 31:12.280
of my life right here.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.070
- I'm so happy for you.

31:14.070 --> 31:16.040
You mentioned the people

31:14.070 --> 31:16.040
you love and care about.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.180
Your mom is here.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.180
Mama, I need you here.

31:17.180 --> 31:20.190
I love it.

31:17.180 --> 31:20.190
You come on in.

31:20.190 --> 31:22.260
- I knew he could do it.

31:20.190 --> 31:22.260
I knew he could do it.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.000
I knew you could do it.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.000
I knew you could do it.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.070
I told you it's your time.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.070
You can do it.

31:28.070 --> 31:30.060
- Absolutely, and that's

31:28.070 --> 31:30.060
exactly what he did.

31:30.060 --> 31:31.130
You did it.

31:31.130 --> 31:33.030
We know you're going

31:31.130 --> 31:33.030
to the national finals.

31:33.030 --> 31:35.270
With that time, you might be

31:33.030 --> 31:35.270
headed to the Power Tower.

31:35.270 --> 31:39.130
Great job out there.

31:35.270 --> 31:39.130
Congratulations.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.250
Guys, back to you.

31:41.250 --> 31:44.210
- Coming up, she dominated

31:41.250 --> 31:44.210
the Big Ten

31:44.210 --> 31:46.190
in track and field.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.140
Now pole vaulter Taylor Amann

31:50.140 --> 31:53.010
tries to leap to the national

31:50.140 --> 31:53.010
finals as a rookie.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.240
She's up next on

31:54.000 --> 31:57.240
"American Ninja Warrior."

32:03.080 --> 32:03.090
.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.140
- Welcome back

32:06.000 --> 32:06.140
"American Ninja Warrior,"

32:07.050 --> 32:08.200
coming to you

32:08.200 --> 32:11.260
from the state capitol

32:08.200 --> 32:11.260
building in Oklahoma City.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.100
And up next is one of

32:14.100 --> 32:16.270
this season's

32:14.100 --> 32:16.270
breakout rookies.

32:16.270 --> 32:19.210
It's 22-year-old Taylor Amann,

32:19.210 --> 32:22.110
and she's got an impressive

32:19.210 --> 32:22.110
athletic background.

32:22.110 --> 32:24.130
She was an all-American

32:22.110 --> 32:24.130
pole vaulter

32:24.130 --> 32:26.130
and a three-time

32:24.130 --> 32:26.130
Big Ten champion

32:26.130 --> 32:28.150
at the University

32:26.130 --> 32:28.150
of Wisconsin,

32:28.150 --> 32:32.180
and pole vaulters have done

32:28.150 --> 32:32.180
very well on our course.

32:32.180 --> 32:33.280
[dramatic music]

32:33.280 --> 32:35.170
- To be a pole vaulter,

32:33.280 --> 32:35.170
it's really important

32:35.170 --> 32:39.010
to have spatial awareness

32:35.170 --> 32:39.010
and body awareness.

32:39.010 --> 32:42.050
♪ ♪

32:42.050 --> 32:44.110
And that translates

32:42.050 --> 32:44.110
to ninja really well.

32:44.110 --> 32:45.210
- Meagan!

32:45.210 --> 32:47.030
- Meagan Martin

32:45.210 --> 32:47.030
and Jessie Graff

32:47.030 --> 32:49.180
both were pole vaulters.

32:49.180 --> 32:51.040
Whether I knew it or not,

32:51.040 --> 32:53.150
I've been training my whole

32:51.040 --> 32:53.150
life, basically, for this.

32:53.150 --> 32:54.250
- Yeah!

32:54.250 --> 32:56.250
- My strategy going

32:54.250 --> 32:56.250
into the city finals

32:56.250 --> 33:00.080
is just being confident

32:56.250 --> 33:00.080
and trusting in my abilities

33:00.080 --> 33:03.060
'cause I know I can do

33:00.080 --> 33:03.060
all these obstacles.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.080
Tonight I'm vaulting my way

33:03.060 --> 33:05.080
to that buzzer.

33:09.170 --> 33:12.100
- Down on the sidelines

33:09.170 --> 33:12.100
pumping up the crowd,

33:12.100 --> 33:14.110
that's her boyfriend

33:12.100 --> 33:14.110
Clay Raterman.

33:14.110 --> 33:17.080
He also competed

33:14.110 --> 33:17.080
a few weeks ago in qualifying,

33:17.080 --> 33:19.140
but he didn't make it

33:17.080 --> 33:19.140
as far as she did.

33:19.140 --> 33:22.000
Clay didn't qualify

33:19.140 --> 33:22.000
for the city finals,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.050
but Taylor did.

33:23.050 --> 33:25.150
[countdown clock beeping]

33:25.150 --> 33:28.080
Well, this is a loaded field

33:25.150 --> 33:28.080
of female ninjas.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.000
Amann made it to the fifth

33:28.080 --> 33:31.000
obstacle in qualifying,

33:31.000 --> 33:32.280
probably gonna need to

33:31.000 --> 33:32.280
go at least that far tonight

33:32.280 --> 33:34.070
if she wants to move on.

33:34.070 --> 33:35.230
- Yeah, it's gonna be a battle

33:35.230 --> 33:37.250
among the women

33:35.230 --> 33:37.250
for those top two spots.

33:37.250 --> 33:40.190
- This is Amann's first time

33:37.250 --> 33:40.190
on "American Ninja Warrior."

33:40.190 --> 33:42.240
She did compete

33:40.190 --> 33:42.240
in our college edition

33:42.240 --> 33:44.160
for the University

33:42.240 --> 33:44.160
of Wisconsin

33:44.160 --> 33:46.230
and she was undefeated.

33:46.230 --> 33:48.020
- Nice!

33:48.020 --> 33:49.280
- Taylor representing

33:48.020 --> 33:49.280
the Badgers well.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.240
Pole vaulting's

33:49.280 --> 33:51.240
such a great skill set,

33:51.240 --> 33:53.260
and she's putting those skills

33:51.240 --> 33:53.260
to use here

33:53.260 --> 33:56.110
in her rookie campaign

33:53.260 --> 33:56.110
on "Ninja Warrior."

33:56.110 --> 33:57.210
- Let's go, Taylor!

33:57.210 --> 33:59.230
- Now on to the Fly Wheels.

33:59.230 --> 34:01.090
- Yeah, and, Matt,

33:59.230 --> 34:01.090
in back-to-back obstacles

34:01.090 --> 34:02.240
she's gonna need

34:01.090 --> 34:02.240
spatial awareness.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.160
It's the same type

34:02.240 --> 34:04.160
of spatial awareness

34:04.160 --> 34:06.140
you have to have when

34:04.160 --> 34:06.140
you're doing pole vaulting.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.260
- Well, you generate the power

34:06.140 --> 34:07.260
with the hips

34:07.260 --> 34:08.260
for these laches,

34:08.260 --> 34:10.070
and she's doing just that.

34:10.070 --> 34:12.230
- I mean, beautiful

34:10.070 --> 34:12.230
in the air.

34:12.230 --> 34:14.170
- Seeing that swing leg again.

34:14.170 --> 34:18.050
That's a pole vaulting

34:14.170 --> 34:18.050
technique.

34:18.050 --> 34:19.210
Great dismount.

34:19.210 --> 34:21.170
Boy, Amann looking strong,

34:21.170 --> 34:24.090
a substantially faster pace

34:21.170 --> 34:24.090
than in qualifying.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.030
- Taylor, feet in the middle.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.150
- Clay giving her some advice

34:26.030 --> 34:28.150
for the Diving Boards.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.250
- Yeah, she's got long legs.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.250
Use those long legs.

34:30.250 --> 34:33.090
- These balance obstacles

34:30.250 --> 34:33.090
always unforgiving.

34:33.090 --> 34:35.280
One misstep,

34:33.090 --> 34:35.280
and your season can end.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.050
- Nice, nice.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.050
- Ooh!

34:37.050 --> 34:41.090
- Oh, okay. She's good.

34:37.050 --> 34:41.090
She's good.

34:41.090 --> 34:42.210
- Now on Coconut Climb,

34:42.210 --> 34:45.150
the obstacle that took her out

34:42.210 --> 34:45.150
in qualifying.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.260
She couldn't get past

34:45.150 --> 34:47.260
the midway point.

34:47.260 --> 34:49.150
- As a rookie,

34:47.260 --> 34:49.150
look what she's doing.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.130
She's going right

34:49.150 --> 34:51.130
into Coconut Climb.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.230
She's got the time.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.230
She's going for speed as well.

34:53.230 --> 34:57.070
- And she is well ahead

34:53.230 --> 34:57.070
of the pace of Maggi Thorne.

34:57.070 --> 34:58.280
Maggi Thorne, though,

34:57.070 --> 34:58.280
the first woman

34:58.280 --> 35:00.170
to get through this obstacle.

35:00.170 --> 35:03.090
- And this is where Taylor

35:00.170 --> 35:03.090
stalled out in qualifying.

35:03.090 --> 35:06.070
Gotta lock that ring up

35:03.090 --> 35:06.070
on the top.

35:06.070 --> 35:08.010
- Taylor, big hop, yeah!

35:06.070 --> 35:08.010
- There we go.

35:08.010 --> 35:11.250
Good job there on that ascent

35:08.010 --> 35:11.250
to get that final cleat.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.280
- Kick! There you go.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.280
Bigger kick.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.110
- 5'7", longer wingspan

35:13.280 --> 35:16.110
than Will has.

35:16.110 --> 35:19.190
Easy transition

35:16.110 --> 35:19.190
there up top for Taylor.

35:19.190 --> 35:21.280
- I mean, Amann is

35:19.190 --> 35:21.280
not playing around.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.110
- And good job controlling

35:21.280 --> 35:24.110
that handle on the descent.

35:24.110 --> 35:28.070
- Uh-oh, come on.

35:24.110 --> 35:28.070
- You gotta kip it up here.

35:28.070 --> 35:29.210
- Watch the right hand.

35:28.070 --> 35:29.210
- There we go.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.010
- All right, now--

35:29.210 --> 35:31.010
- Much better to do it

35:31.010 --> 35:33.210
on the backswing.

35:31.010 --> 35:33.210
Taylor figured it out.

35:33.210 --> 35:36.280
- And look at her feet, Matt.

35:33.210 --> 35:36.280
They are shaking.

35:36.280 --> 35:39.010
- Well, this is not easy.

35:36.280 --> 35:39.010
- No, she's smart.

35:39.010 --> 35:41.050
She knows what to do.

35:39.010 --> 35:41.050
She's an academic all-American.

35:41.050 --> 35:42.190
- Wow, this is it.

35:42.190 --> 35:45.210
What a difference experience

35:42.190 --> 35:45.210
is making, and Taylor Amann

35:45.210 --> 35:48.070
the second woman to face

35:45.210 --> 35:48.070
the Coconut Climb,

35:48.070 --> 35:50.130
the second to get

35:48.070 --> 35:50.130
through it tonight after zero

35:50.130 --> 35:52.210
did it on qualifying.

35:52.210 --> 35:55.150
- Oh, Matt, this is it.

35:52.210 --> 35:55.150
We talk about it,

35:55.150 --> 35:57.250
success begetting success,

35:55.150 --> 35:57.250
and it's happening.

35:57.250 --> 36:00.110
- A new ninja star

35:57.250 --> 36:00.110
in the making.

36:00.110 --> 36:02.130
Amann already

36:00.110 --> 36:02.130
does some modeling.

36:02.130 --> 36:04.170
You may have seen her

36:02.130 --> 36:04.170
in commercials for Adidas

36:04.170 --> 36:06.050
and Kohl's department stores.

36:06.050 --> 36:07.170
But with this performance,

36:07.170 --> 36:10.010
people really gonna take notice

36:07.170 --> 36:10.010
of Taylor Amann now.

36:10.010 --> 36:12.130
- And no problem

36:10.010 --> 36:12.130
for Taylor Amann.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.260
- Okay!

36:13.260 --> 36:16.170
- There we go.

36:16.170 --> 36:17.260
[cheers and applause]

36:17.260 --> 36:20.110
- Whoo!

36:17.260 --> 36:20.110
- That's my girlfriend.

36:20.110 --> 36:22.190
- Yeah, you heard him.

36:20.110 --> 36:22.190
"That's my girlfriend."

36:22.190 --> 36:25.090
Everybody knows.

36:22.190 --> 36:25.090
- You can tell Clay is proud.

36:25.090 --> 36:26.210
Taylor Amann

36:25.090 --> 36:26.210
is the first female rookie

36:26.210 --> 36:29.030
to make it to

36:26.210 --> 36:29.030
the back half of the course

36:29.030 --> 36:31.050
since Flex Labreck

36:29.030 --> 36:31.050
three years ago.

36:31.050 --> 36:34.050
First time

36:31.050 --> 36:34.050
facing the Salmon Ladder.

36:34.050 --> 36:38.260
- Matt, we're about to have us

36:34.050 --> 36:38.260
a rookie rock star.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.010
- Going with that switch grip.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.010
- Okay, here we go.

36:41.010 --> 36:44.210
I'm watching you.

36:41.010 --> 36:44.210
Nice. Ooh, okay.

36:44.210 --> 36:46.130
Matt, she struggled

36:44.210 --> 36:46.130
to get up that first rung.

36:46.130 --> 36:48.030
It's starting to wear on her,

36:46.130 --> 36:48.030
but that's all right.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.090
She's fighting through it.

36:49.090 --> 36:50.170
- You can see not

36:49.090 --> 36:50.170
the most efficient,

36:50.170 --> 36:52.190
doesn't

36:50.170 --> 36:52.190
have a ton of ninja training.

36:52.190 --> 36:54.050
- That's all right!

36:52.190 --> 36:54.050
- But she's figured it out.

36:54.050 --> 36:56.070
- Come on, one more!

36:54.050 --> 36:56.070
- Oh! She can go for it.

36:56.070 --> 36:58.150
She just needs to reach out.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.190
Gets the bar to the top!

37:00.190 --> 37:02.190
And she's going

37:00.190 --> 37:02.190
for the Crazy Clocks.

37:02.190 --> 37:05.050
And she's on it!

37:02.190 --> 37:05.050
- Nice!

37:05.050 --> 37:06.230
- That could be a big

37:05.050 --> 37:06.230
difference-maker.

37:06.230 --> 37:08.190
- Matt, she's gonna need that

37:06.230 --> 37:08.190
upper-body strength, Matt.

37:08.190 --> 37:10.000
She's gonna have

37:08.190 --> 37:10.000
to engage the--

37:10.000 --> 37:11.170
both: Oh!

37:11.170 --> 37:13.190
- The grip gave out,

37:13.190 --> 37:15.260
but she reached

37:13.190 --> 37:15.260
the eighth obstacle,

37:15.260 --> 37:18.090
and she got there quickly.

37:15.260 --> 37:18.090
We'll have to wait to see,

37:18.090 --> 37:22.130
but that could be good enough

37:18.090 --> 37:22.130
to get her to Vegas.

37:22.130 --> 37:25.130
- She survived a little

37:22.130 --> 37:25.130
stumble on the Diving Boards

37:25.130 --> 37:27.110
and then used

37:25.130 --> 37:27.110
those pole vaulting skills

37:27.110 --> 37:30.010
to explode up the Warped Wall.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.190
She reached the Crazy Clocks

37:31.190 --> 37:33.280
about a minute faster

37:31.190 --> 37:33.280
than Maggi Thorne,

37:33.280 --> 37:37.030
which moves Taylor into

37:33.280 --> 37:37.030
the top spot among our women,

37:37.030 --> 37:41.150
but in the end her grip

37:37.030 --> 37:41.150
just gave out.

37:41.150 --> 37:43.070
[cheers and applause]

37:43.070 --> 37:46.030
- And getting lots of love

37:43.070 --> 37:46.030
from the boyfriend, Clay.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.090
Some strong women

37:46.030 --> 37:48.090
still to come.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.050
But Taylor Amann

37:48.090 --> 37:50.050
may just have put herself

37:50.050 --> 37:52.050
in the national finals.

37:52.050 --> 37:55.130
Well, they don't call him

37:52.050 --> 37:55.130
the Cake Ninja for nothing.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.130
Hotshot rookie David Wright

37:57.130 --> 37:59.260
fuels up

37:57.130 --> 37:59.260
with a mouthful of cake.

37:59.260 --> 38:03.070
Hope he'll have that swallowed

37:59.260 --> 38:03.070
when he runs next,

38:03.070 --> 38:08.010
plus Barclay Stockett's taking

38:03.070 --> 38:08.010
her ninja skills to Africa.

38:08.010 --> 38:10.170
- I've played on a lot

38:08.010 --> 38:10.170
of ninja courses,

38:10.170 --> 38:14.150
but I've never played on one

38:10.170 --> 38:14.150
with so many smiling faces.

38:14.150 --> 38:18.130
- Her journey's coming up

38:14.150 --> 38:18.130
on "American Ninja Warrior."

38:22.070 --> 38:22.070
.

38:24.010 --> 38:24.280
- Welcome back to

38:24.150 --> 38:24.280
"American Ninja Warrior"

38:26.000 --> 38:28.260
and the Oklahoma city finals.

38:28.260 --> 38:31.010
Our athletes are all competing

38:28.260 --> 38:31.010
for a spot

38:31.010 --> 38:32.210
in the national finals,

38:32.210 --> 38:35.170
which kick off next month

38:32.210 --> 38:35.170
in Las Vegas.

38:35.170 --> 38:37.010
While we were away,

38:37.010 --> 38:39.150
longtime competitor

38:37.010 --> 38:39.150
Brent Steffensen

38:39.150 --> 38:42.190
made his ninth appearance

38:39.150 --> 38:42.190
on a city finals course.

38:42.190 --> 38:44.250
- One of the

38:42.190 --> 38:44.250
original ninja stars.

38:44.250 --> 38:48.090
- The 38-year-old was looking

38:44.250 --> 38:48.090
spry on the course early.

38:48.090 --> 38:50.170
- He is moving like

38:48.090 --> 38:50.170
he's still got it, Matt.

38:50.170 --> 38:52.130
- But even this ninja veteran

38:52.130 --> 38:54.170
couldn't

38:52.130 --> 38:54.170
get past the Crazy Clocks.

38:54.170 --> 38:58.230
- He's fighting father time

38:54.170 --> 38:58.230
and the Crazy Clock! Oh!

38:58.230 --> 39:00.110
- No!

39:00.110 --> 39:04.090
- To go out like that, what?

39:00.110 --> 39:04.090
- Then it was Josh Salinas,

39:04.090 --> 39:07.010
who got a nice sendoff

39:04.090 --> 39:07.010
from the kids he coaches

39:07.010 --> 39:09.070
at the Iron Sports Gym

39:07.010 --> 39:09.070
in Houston.

39:09.070 --> 39:11.130
- He's got backup, Matt.

39:09.070 --> 39:11.130
- Oh, there we go.

39:11.130 --> 39:12.230
- Oh, they love him.

39:12.230 --> 39:16.000
- Iron Josh then put on

39:12.230 --> 39:16.000
a clinic on the course.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.260
- Can we just say

39:16.000 --> 39:19.260
how efficient that was? Wow.

39:19.260 --> 39:21.280
- He became one of

39:19.260 --> 39:21.280
the few competitors

39:21.280 --> 39:24.210
to make it past Crazy Clocks,

39:24.210 --> 39:27.090
but he couldn't handle

39:24.210 --> 39:27.090
Snapback.

39:27.090 --> 39:29.170
- Oooh!

39:29.170 --> 39:31.280
- That's tricky, man.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.090
But that's a great obstacle,

39:31.280 --> 39:34.090
really.

39:34.090 --> 39:37.110
- If you're starting to get

39:34.090 --> 39:37.110
hungry, there's a reason why,

39:37.110 --> 39:41.090
because up next is

39:37.110 --> 39:41.090
the Cake Ninja, David Wright.

39:41.090 --> 39:43.210
He's another one of

39:41.090 --> 39:43.210
the outstanding ninjas

39:43.210 --> 39:45.130
from the Houston area.

39:45.130 --> 39:47.170
Wright's

39:45.130 --> 39:47.170
a 19-year-old lifeguard,

39:47.170 --> 39:51.050
but what makes him really

39:47.170 --> 39:51.050
unique is his love of cake.

39:51.050 --> 39:53.130
He eats it right

39:51.050 --> 39:53.130
before he competes

39:53.130 --> 39:56.210
and also has friends

39:53.130 --> 39:56.210
pass out cake to the fans.

39:56.210 --> 39:59.090
This crowd's enjoying it,

39:56.210 --> 39:59.090
and so are we.

39:59.090 --> 40:01.050
- Wow, this is delicious.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.190
- Well, there's his mom

40:01.050 --> 40:03.190
and dad on the sidelines.

40:03.190 --> 40:05.050
They have nine kids,

40:05.050 --> 40:07.250
so lots of birthday cakes

40:05.050 --> 40:07.250
in the Wright family.

40:07.250 --> 40:11.210
[countdown clock beeping]

40:11.210 --> 40:14.090
- This kid had a sweet run

40:11.210 --> 40:14.090
in qualifying,

40:14.090 --> 40:17.110
hit the buzzer

40:14.090 --> 40:17.110
his first time on the course.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.230
- Now the Wing Swing.

40:20.230 --> 40:22.130
And very smooth.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.150
- Oh, he knows how to keep

40:22.130 --> 40:24.150
the crowd happy.

40:24.150 --> 40:26.000
Give them cake.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.110
- Well, he's entertaining even

40:26.000 --> 40:28.110
without the cake,

40:28.110 --> 40:32.010
already on the third obstacle,

40:28.110 --> 40:32.010
the Fly Wheels.

40:32.010 --> 40:34.010
- 5'11", 168 pounds,

40:34.010 --> 40:35.150
you would think

40:34.010 --> 40:35.150
he'd be a little heavier

40:35.150 --> 40:38.150
with all them calories

40:35.150 --> 40:38.150
he consumes in cake.

40:38.150 --> 40:41.010
[cheers and applause]

40:41.010 --> 40:44.030
- Gotta be careful

40:41.010 --> 40:44.030
on the Diving Boards.

40:44.030 --> 40:45.110
- Ooh, okay.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.230
- Perfect.

40:46.230 --> 40:48.190
[cheers and applause]

40:48.190 --> 40:52.050
Now the Coconut Climb.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.280
- Hold on, wait,

40:52.050 --> 40:54.280
did he just kiss the tree?

40:54.280 --> 40:56.230
I know he likes coconut cake,

40:56.230 --> 40:59.150
but I guess he likes

40:56.230 --> 40:59.150
coconut trees too.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.260
- So important

40:59.150 --> 41:00.260
to be efficient here,

41:00.260 --> 41:02.090
not just to get through

41:00.260 --> 41:02.090
this obstacle

41:02.090 --> 41:03.230
but to preserve

41:02.090 --> 41:03.230
that upper body,

41:03.230 --> 41:05.010
particularly that

41:03.230 --> 41:05.010
grip strength,

41:05.010 --> 41:06.170
for the back half.

41:06.170 --> 41:08.230
The Cake Ninja taking

41:06.170 --> 41:08.230
a nice slice out of this one.

41:08.230 --> 41:13.130
- 5'11", pretty good reach.

41:08.230 --> 41:13.130
- And he's got it.

41:13.130 --> 41:14.250
Very efficient.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.030
- All right, here we go.

41:16.030 --> 41:18.190
- Just so impressive

41:16.030 --> 41:18.190
for a 19-year-old

41:18.190 --> 41:20.130
to be out here

41:18.190 --> 41:20.130
looking so calm

41:20.130 --> 41:22.130
in this

41:20.130 --> 41:22.130
city finals competition.

41:22.130 --> 41:24.210
- David Wright has waited

41:22.130 --> 41:24.210
for this opportunity.

41:24.210 --> 41:29.090
It's his rookie season, and he

41:24.210 --> 41:29.090
wants to show up and show out.

41:29.090 --> 41:30.250
- Perfect.

41:30.250 --> 41:34.000
Wright trying to hit a city

41:30.250 --> 41:34.000
finals buzzer as a rookie.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.250
That's a huge accomplishment.

41:35.250 --> 41:39.010
Kid Owhadi was able

41:35.250 --> 41:39.010
to do it last year.

41:39.010 --> 41:42.250
Kid and David Wright both train

41:39.010 --> 41:42.250
at Iron Sports in Houston.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.260
And the Cake Ninja

41:42.250 --> 41:45.260
right up the Warped Wall.

41:45.260 --> 41:47.130
I got a little red velvet.

41:45.260 --> 41:47.130
We're ready.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.110
- We're supposed to wait

41:47.130 --> 41:49.110
until he hits the buzzer,

41:49.110 --> 41:51.150
but I couldn't wait.

41:51.150 --> 41:54.110
all: We want cake!

41:51.150 --> 41:54.110
We want cake!

41:54.110 --> 41:57.130
- Daniel Gil leading

41:54.110 --> 41:57.130
the "we want cake" chant.

41:57.130 --> 41:59.110
David works and trains

41:57.130 --> 41:59.110
with Daniel

41:59.110 --> 42:00.280
at Iron Sports Gym.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.150
Now on the Salmon Ladder,

42:00.280 --> 42:03.150
going with that switch grip.

42:03.150 --> 42:06.230
- Matt, oh, man, look at that.

42:03.150 --> 42:06.230
- Wow. Great power.

42:06.230 --> 42:08.110
- When you go up

42:06.230 --> 42:08.110
the Salmon Ladder

42:08.110 --> 42:10.110
with authority like that,

42:08.110 --> 42:10.110
you know you mean business.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.090
- Let's see what he does

42:10.110 --> 42:12.090
with the Crazy Clocks.

42:12.090 --> 42:13.260
- We've seen

42:12.090 --> 42:13.260
a lot of ninjas struggle

42:13.260 --> 42:15.210
on this obstacle tonight.

42:17.010 --> 42:19.010
- Oh, and he kicked the board.

42:19.010 --> 42:22.010
Now it's a moving target,

42:19.010 --> 42:22.010
but he got it!

42:22.010 --> 42:23.130
- Well, this dude's

42:22.010 --> 42:23.130
a lifeguard, though.

42:23.130 --> 42:24.280
Don't forget about that.

42:24.280 --> 42:27.260
He's got great, great stamina

42:24.280 --> 42:27.260
to be a lifeguard.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.130
All right, come on,

42:27.260 --> 42:29.130
mister lifeguard.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.280
I'm Baywatching you.

42:30.280 --> 42:34.130
- His mom's trying

42:30.280 --> 42:34.130
to coach him through it.

42:34.130 --> 42:36.190
See, she's a nervous wreck.

42:36.190 --> 42:39.230
- Nice.

42:36.190 --> 42:39.230
- Just needs the dismount.

42:39.230 --> 42:41.260
And right through

42:39.230 --> 42:41.260
Crazy Clocks.

42:41.260 --> 42:44.090
[cheers and applause]

42:44.090 --> 42:47.010
This crowd is on their feet

42:44.090 --> 42:47.010
for the rookie

42:47.010 --> 42:49.050
as he steps up to Snapback.

42:49.050 --> 42:51.090
all: We want cake!

42:49.050 --> 42:51.090
We want cake!

42:51.090 --> 42:52.230
- He's gotta have

42:51.090 --> 42:52.230
that grip strength.

42:52.230 --> 42:54.260
- What I like is he's

42:52.230 --> 42:54.260
at least been efficient.

42:54.260 --> 42:57.150
He's given himself the best

42:54.260 --> 42:57.150
chance to get through this.

42:57.150 --> 42:59.010
- Ooh, okay!

42:57.150 --> 42:59.010
- He's got that first one.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.190
- He ain't drowning

42:59.010 --> 43:00.190
in fatigue.

43:00.190 --> 43:02.110
He's a lifeguard,

43:00.190 --> 43:02.110
for heaven sakes!

43:02.110 --> 43:03.260
- Gets to the second one

43:03.260 --> 43:06.000
but has to do that blind grab

43:03.260 --> 43:06.000
all over again.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.210
- About to go down.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.210
It's about to go down!

43:07.210 --> 43:09.170
- It'd be sweet if--he did it!

43:07.210 --> 43:09.170
- It's about to go down!

43:09.170 --> 43:11.190
- Got to get the dismount!

43:09.170 --> 43:11.190
- Okay, yes!

43:11.190 --> 43:15.190
- Put the frosting on it!

43:11.190 --> 43:15.190
That's a 10-foot leap.

43:15.190 --> 43:19.050
The Cake Ninja

43:15.190 --> 43:19.050
gets through Snapback!

43:19.050 --> 43:21.010
[cheers and applause]

43:21.010 --> 43:23.010
We're about 35 feet away

43:23.010 --> 43:25.000
from a feast up here

43:23.010 --> 43:25.000
in the host tower.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.150
- We about to eat--you about

43:25.000 --> 43:28.150
to eat right now!

43:28.150 --> 43:30.210
- Trying to be the first

43:28.150 --> 43:30.210
19-year-old

43:30.210 --> 43:33.170
to hit a city finals buzzer

43:30.210 --> 43:33.170
this season.

43:33.170 --> 43:35.230
Kid Owhadi was the first

43:33.170 --> 43:35.230
19-year-old

43:35.230 --> 43:37.210
to pull it off last year.

43:37.210 --> 43:39.230
- Come here, Mama.

43:39.230 --> 43:43.130
- Well, 35 feet,

43:39.230 --> 43:43.130
three sets of doors.

43:43.130 --> 43:45.150
In total those doors weigh

43:43.130 --> 43:45.150
100 pounds,

43:45.150 --> 43:47.000
50 pounds each here.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.150
- All right, show me the

43:47.000 --> 43:48.150
muscles again, man.

43:48.150 --> 43:50.130
100 pounds.

43:48.150 --> 43:50.130
- He's moving,

43:50.130 --> 43:51.260
locking that lower body,

43:51.260 --> 43:53.070
and David Wright's done it.

43:53.070 --> 43:54.230
- All right, here we go.

43:53.070 --> 43:54.230
He's going for it, Matt.

43:54.230 --> 43:56.010
- Go!

43:56.010 --> 43:59.090
- Who is this 19-year-old?

43:56.010 --> 43:59.090
Oh, man.

43:59.090 --> 44:01.130
- The whole crowd's feast

43:59.090 --> 44:01.130
is waiting on him,

44:01.130 --> 44:03.050
and he's struggling

44:01.130 --> 44:03.050
to get those doors up

44:03.050 --> 44:04.230
but finding a way!

44:04.230 --> 44:06.250
- People are buying cake

44:04.230 --> 44:06.250
everywhere now.

44:06.250 --> 44:08.170
- Oh, my.

44:06.250 --> 44:08.170
Put the candles on it.

44:08.170 --> 44:10.070
- The price of cake

44:08.170 --> 44:10.070
just went up!

44:10.070 --> 44:11.190
The price of cake

44:10.070 --> 44:11.190
just went up,

44:11.190 --> 44:12.260
and he's getting 'em!

44:12.260 --> 44:14.110
- David Wright,

44:12.260 --> 44:14.110
is it possible?

44:14.110 --> 44:17.030
A 19-year-old rookie,

44:14.110 --> 44:17.030
and he's new to field!

44:17.030 --> 44:19.150
- Hit that right there,

44:17.030 --> 44:19.150
the button.

44:19.150 --> 44:21.030
Hit that right there,

44:19.150 --> 44:21.030
the button!

44:21.030 --> 44:22.110
I love you, Mr. Cake.

44:22.110 --> 44:24.030
- And David Wright

44:22.110 --> 44:24.030
has said it:

44:24.030 --> 44:26.050
"Let them eat cake."

44:26.050 --> 44:28.150
- [shouts indistinctly]

44:28.150 --> 44:31.070
[cheers and applause]

44:31.070 --> 44:32.190
- The 19-year-old rookie

44:32.190 --> 44:35.190
is our second finisher

44:32.190 --> 44:35.190
of the night.

44:35.190 --> 44:38.250
He's going to

44:35.190 --> 44:38.250
the national finals.

44:38.250 --> 44:42.190
- Oh, a buzzer's never tasted

44:38.250 --> 44:42.190
so good.

44:42.190 --> 44:45.210
- That's amazing, isn't it?

44:42.190 --> 44:45.210
- I love the Cake Ninja.

44:45.210 --> 44:47.070
- I love cake.

44:47.070 --> 44:50.260
- What a moment

44:47.070 --> 44:50.260
for David Wright.

44:50.260 --> 44:52.210
- Only 19 years old,

44:52.210 --> 44:55.090
and he was in control

44:52.210 --> 44:55.090
the whole way,

44:55.090 --> 44:58.130
powered his way through

44:55.090 --> 44:58.130
his first city finals course,

44:58.130 --> 45:00.070
and he's the first rookie

44:58.130 --> 45:00.070
this season

45:00.070 --> 45:02.090
to hit two buzzers.

45:05.030 --> 45:07.210
- That big family of his

45:05.030 --> 45:07.210
better pack their bags.

45:07.210 --> 45:11.190
They're going to the

45:07.210 --> 45:11.190
national finals in Las Vegas.

45:11.190 --> 45:13.000
[bird caws]

45:13.000 --> 45:16.130
Coming up, they're two

45:13.000 --> 45:16.130
of the best in the west.

45:16.130 --> 45:19.070
- You're going down, Kid.

45:19.070 --> 45:23.150
- Now Daniel Gil

45:19.070 --> 45:23.150
and Kid Owhadi

45:23.150 --> 45:25.110
are ready for a showdown

45:25.110 --> 45:29.050
to see who is

45:25.110 --> 45:29.050
the fastest ninja in OKC.

45:29.050 --> 45:31.030
- Oh, they going at it!

45:31.030 --> 45:33.280
- Plus, she's got

45:31.030 --> 45:33.280
a high-pressure job...

45:33.280 --> 45:37.210
- Here we are.

45:33.280 --> 45:37.210
- And two kids at home,

45:37.210 --> 45:41.090
but Karen Wiltin can still

45:37.210 --> 45:41.090
kill it on a ninja course.

45:41.090 --> 45:42.230
She's got it!

45:42.230 --> 45:44.090
- ♪ Welcome to my world ♪

45:44.090 --> 45:48.070
- She's coming up next on

45:44.090 --> 45:48.070
"American Ninja Warrior."

45:51.090 --> 45:51.110
.

45:53.110 --> 45:54.090
- Welcome back to

45:53.260 --> 45:54.090
"American Ninja Warrior."

45:55.150 --> 45:58.110
We're right outside the state

45:55.150 --> 45:58.110
capitol here in Oklahoma City,

45:58.110 --> 46:03.030
and so far it's all about

45:58.110 --> 46:03.030
the girl power on this course.

46:03.030 --> 46:04.130
- Matt, that's right.

46:04.130 --> 46:06.170
In our 11 years,

46:04.130 --> 46:06.170
14 women

46:06.170 --> 46:09.000
made it up the Warped Wall

46:06.170 --> 46:09.000
before tonight,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.210
but we've already

46:09.000 --> 46:12.210
had two do it here in OKC.

46:12.210 --> 46:16.210
First Nebraska's Maggi Thorne

46:12.210 --> 46:16.210
became just the second mom

46:16.210 --> 46:19.260
ever to climb

46:16.210 --> 46:19.260
the 14 1/2-foot wall.

46:19.260 --> 46:21.110
- Yes!

46:21.110 --> 46:23.070
- Yes!

46:23.070 --> 46:26.150
- And then Taylor Amann,

46:23.070 --> 46:26.150
a 22-year-old rookie,

46:26.150 --> 46:28.170
also beat the Warped Wall.

46:28.170 --> 46:30.170
- Yes!

46:28.170 --> 46:30.170
- Whoo-hoo!

46:30.170 --> 46:33.150
- They eventually fell

46:30.170 --> 46:33.150
on the Crazy Clocks,

46:33.150 --> 46:37.250
but great runs

46:33.150 --> 46:37.250
for both these women.

46:37.250 --> 46:40.030
- These ladies are

46:37.250 --> 46:40.030
lighting it up tonight,

46:40.030 --> 46:43.170
and we've got another one

46:40.030 --> 46:43.170
of our strong women up next.

46:43.170 --> 46:47.130
This is 41-year-old physician

46:43.170 --> 46:47.130
assistant Karen Wiltin.

46:47.130 --> 46:49.190
She had an impressive run

46:47.130 --> 46:49.190
in qualifying

46:49.190 --> 46:51.090
that got her

46:49.190 --> 46:51.090
to the city finals

46:51.090 --> 46:53.030
for the second year in a row,

46:53.030 --> 46:56.280
and she's hoping for better

46:53.030 --> 46:56.280
results this time around.

46:56.280 --> 46:59.260
Last year, Karen, a physician

46:56.280 --> 46:59.260
assistant and mother of two

46:59.260 --> 47:02.000
with no athletic background

47:02.000 --> 47:03.280
and only a few months

47:02.000 --> 47:03.280
of ninja training,

47:03.280 --> 47:06.210
shocked everyone,

47:03.280 --> 47:06.210
including herself,

47:06.210 --> 47:12.030
by making it to the fifth

47:06.210 --> 47:12.030
obstacle in Dallas qualifying.

47:12.030 --> 47:16.090
- Where there's a Wiltin,

47:12.030 --> 47:16.090
there's a way! Nice!

47:16.090 --> 47:18.230
- But her season ended

47:16.090 --> 47:18.230
suddenly when she fell

47:18.230 --> 47:21.190
on the first obstacle

47:18.230 --> 47:21.190
in city finals.

47:21.190 --> 47:25.090
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

47:25.090 --> 47:27.260
- Now, after another

47:25.090 --> 47:27.260
impressive qualifying run,

47:27.260 --> 47:30.030
Karen's back

47:27.260 --> 47:30.030
in the city finals

47:30.030 --> 47:33.230
and tonight she plans to show

47:30.030 --> 47:33.230
everyone she belongs.

47:33.230 --> 47:37.030
- Nice! Nice!

47:33.230 --> 47:37.030
That's what I'm talking about!

47:37.030 --> 47:38.230
- The reason I wanted

47:37.030 --> 47:38.230
to come back this year

47:38.230 --> 47:41.000
was to show my girls

47:38.230 --> 47:41.000
that even though

47:41.000 --> 47:43.030
Mommy fell on the first

47:41.000 --> 47:43.030
obstacle last year

47:43.030 --> 47:46.110
in the city finals

47:43.030 --> 47:46.110
that I--I can come back,

47:46.110 --> 47:48.190
and my goal is to get up

47:46.110 --> 47:48.190
that Warped Wall,

47:48.190 --> 47:50.260
that they can go

47:48.190 --> 47:50.260
after their dreams.

47:54.030 --> 47:56.010
- And there are

47:54.030 --> 47:56.010
her biggest fans,

47:56.010 --> 47:57.280
her two daughters,

47:56.010 --> 47:57.280
Etta and Mary,

47:57.280 --> 48:01.110
and her husband Brian,

47:57.280 --> 48:01.110
and here we go.

48:01.110 --> 48:04.130
Gotta be a little nervous

48:01.110 --> 48:04.130
about this first obstacle,

48:04.130 --> 48:07.190
I see her hesitating a little.

48:04.130 --> 48:07.190
Now she goes.

48:07.190 --> 48:10.030
- All right, come on, Karen.

48:07.190 --> 48:10.030
You got this.

48:10.030 --> 48:13.170
Oh, need a little extra swing.

48:13.170 --> 48:15.090
- And another.

48:15.090 --> 48:18.090
Gotta be having flashbacks.

48:15.090 --> 48:18.090
But she's through.

48:18.090 --> 48:20.190
- And look at that.

48:18.090 --> 48:20.190
They are happy for Mommy.

48:20.190 --> 48:23.010
That wasn't looking good

48:20.190 --> 48:23.010
for a minute though.

48:23.010 --> 48:24.280
- Karen Wiltin has to be

48:23.010 --> 48:24.280
relieved

48:24.280 --> 48:26.190
to have that behind her

48:24.280 --> 48:26.190
as she moves on now

48:26.190 --> 48:27.210
to the Wing Swing.

48:27.210 --> 48:29.030
- This is it, Karen, swing.

48:29.030 --> 48:30.130
all: Karen! Karen!

48:30.130 --> 48:32.050
- And the crowd starting

48:30.130 --> 48:32.050
the Karen chants.

48:32.050 --> 48:33.170
all: Karen! Karen!

48:33.170 --> 48:34.260
- Let me tell you something.

48:34.260 --> 48:37.150
She's got a lot of power,

48:34.260 --> 48:37.150
a lot of spunk.

48:37.150 --> 48:39.030
- She only started training

48:37.150 --> 48:39.030
seven months

48:39.030 --> 48:40.110
before last season.

48:40.110 --> 48:41.190
- Come on.

48:41.190 --> 48:43.010
- Got it!

48:41.190 --> 48:43.010
- Yes!

48:43.010 --> 48:45.070
- Long flight

48:43.010 --> 48:45.070
for Karen Wiltin.

48:45.070 --> 48:47.110
- In case you don't know,

48:45.070 --> 48:47.110
I'm on Team Wiltin, Matt.

48:47.110 --> 48:49.150
It's amazing

48:47.110 --> 48:49.150
that this 41-year-old woman

48:49.150 --> 48:51.170
who never played any sports

48:49.150 --> 48:51.170
growing up

48:51.170 --> 48:54.050
is back in the city finals.

48:54.050 --> 48:57.010
- And look at her training

48:54.050 --> 48:57.010
partners from the Dallas area.

48:57.010 --> 48:59.130
- Gotta love how ninjas

48:57.010 --> 48:59.130
support each other.

48:59.130 --> 49:01.170
- Now taking on

48:59.130 --> 49:01.170
the Fly Wheels.

49:01.170 --> 49:04.170
- Go for it. Okay.

49:01.170 --> 49:04.170
- Good fingertip catch,

49:04.170 --> 49:06.090
but you're really gonna have

49:04.170 --> 49:06.090
to get some power

49:06.090 --> 49:08.190
with that lower body

49:06.090 --> 49:08.190
to make this lache.

49:08.190 --> 49:09.280
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

49:09.280 --> 49:12.230
She's back, Matt.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.230
She's back at it.

49:12.230 --> 49:14.170
- And she is through.

49:14.170 --> 49:16.190
[cheers and applause]

49:16.190 --> 49:18.170
Now the Diving Boards.

49:18.170 --> 49:21.230
5'4", these boards

49:18.170 --> 49:21.230
almost as long as she is.

49:21.230 --> 49:23.260
- Here we go.

49:23.260 --> 49:26.150
- Just like that!

49:26.150 --> 49:29.170
Did you see her bound

49:26.150 --> 49:29.170
through that?

49:29.170 --> 49:31.110
- Karen Wiltin.

49:31.110 --> 49:33.230
[cheers and applause]

49:33.230 --> 49:36.260
And this crowd is fired up

49:33.230 --> 49:36.260
with what they're seeing.

49:36.260 --> 49:39.110
5'4", 110.

49:39.110 --> 49:42.000
But this is the obstacle that

49:39.110 --> 49:42.000
took her down in qualifying,

49:42.000 --> 49:45.030
couldn't reach across

49:42.000 --> 49:45.030
to the second ring.

49:45.030 --> 49:47.110
Her technique really seems

49:45.030 --> 49:47.110
to be improving

49:47.110 --> 49:49.210
with every run

49:47.110 --> 49:49.210
on "American Ninja Warrior."

49:49.210 --> 49:52.210
- We already had two women,

49:49.210 --> 49:52.210
Maggi Thorne and Taylor Amann,

49:52.210 --> 49:54.000
get through this.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.210
Karen Wiltin

49:54.000 --> 49:55.210
trying to be the third.

49:55.210 --> 49:57.010
- You gotta get

49:55.210 --> 49:57.010
some power here

49:57.010 --> 49:58.110
to get to that first cleat

49:57.010 --> 49:58.110
on the ascent.

49:58.110 --> 49:59.210
- And you can see

49:59.210 --> 50:00.280
if she can just

49:59.210 --> 50:00.280
push off that--that branch.

50:00.280 --> 50:02.070
- Good job.

50:00.280 --> 50:02.070
- Nice, nice.

50:02.070 --> 50:03.210
- Perfect.

50:02.070 --> 50:03.210
- Hop it up. Oh, come on.

50:03.210 --> 50:05.170
Come on. Bring it up.

50:03.210 --> 50:05.170
Bring it up, nice!

50:05.170 --> 50:08.050
- Right into it, Wiltin.

50:08.050 --> 50:11.210
Phenomenal, but this is where

50:08.050 --> 50:11.210
she stalled out in qualifying.

50:11.210 --> 50:14.130
Only 5'4",

50:11.210 --> 50:14.130
not much wingspan here.

50:14.130 --> 50:15.280
- That's right, and so she's

50:14.130 --> 50:15.280
got to generate--

50:15.280 --> 50:17.170
- And good job using momentum.

50:15.280 --> 50:17.170
Perfect.

50:17.170 --> 50:18.230
- That's what I'm talking

50:17.170 --> 50:18.230
about.

50:18.230 --> 50:21.000
- Karen Wiltin

50:18.230 --> 50:21.000
on the descent now.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
These women are stepping it up

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
tonight in OKC.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.010
They have figured it out

50:24.000 --> 50:26.010
since qualifying.

50:26.010 --> 50:27.090
- Come on, sister.

50:27.090 --> 50:29.030
- Trying to be the third woman

50:27.090 --> 50:29.030
tonight

50:29.030 --> 50:31.050
to conquer the Coconut Climb.

50:31.050 --> 50:34.030
She's got the feet down,

50:31.050 --> 50:34.030
almost there.

50:34.030 --> 50:37.170
Needs to bring that bar down,

50:34.030 --> 50:37.170
and she's got it.

50:37.170 --> 50:39.010
[cheers and applause]

50:39.010 --> 50:40.260
And look at her,

50:39.010 --> 50:40.260
using those hips,

50:40.260 --> 50:43.110
using that full body to get

50:40.260 --> 50:43.110
the momentum to spin around.

50:43.110 --> 50:44.260
- Now she got it.

50:43.110 --> 50:44.260
She's a rock star.

50:44.260 --> 50:46.030
Come on, rock with it.

50:46.030 --> 50:47.090
- Oh, my.

50:46.030 --> 50:47.090
- She's a rock star!

50:47.090 --> 50:48.190
Come on, Karen!

50:48.190 --> 50:51.190
- Karen Wiltin.

50:48.190 --> 50:51.190
- Go for it! Go for it!

50:51.190 --> 50:53.190
- She's got it!

50:53.190 --> 50:55.110
- That's what I'm

50:53.190 --> 50:55.110
talking about!

50:55.110 --> 50:58.150
- And now this 41-year-old

50:55.110 --> 50:58.150
medical professional

50:58.150 --> 51:02.250
and mom of two is gonna try to

50:58.150 --> 51:02.250
get her first Warped Wall.

51:02.250 --> 51:04.170
Just a few weeks ago,

51:02.250 --> 51:04.170
Sandy Zimmerman

51:04.170 --> 51:06.250
became the first mom

51:04.170 --> 51:06.250
up the wall,

51:06.250 --> 51:09.090
and Maggi Thorne

51:06.250 --> 51:09.090
did it earlier tonight.

51:09.090 --> 51:12.090
- It took us 11 years

51:09.090 --> 51:12.090
to get a mom up the wall.

51:12.090 --> 51:15.170
Now we could have our third

51:12.090 --> 51:15.170
in five weeks.

51:15.170 --> 51:17.010
- Here we go.

51:15.170 --> 51:17.010
- Ooh.

51:17.010 --> 51:19.150
She's got it.

51:17.010 --> 51:19.150
She's got it. She's close.

51:19.150 --> 51:20.280
- A good run.

51:19.150 --> 51:20.280
- She's a physician assistant.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.130
She needs to check

51:20.280 --> 51:22.130
my blood pressure right now.

51:22.130 --> 51:23.210
I can't take it.

51:23.210 --> 51:25.010
- Get it!

51:25.010 --> 51:26.110
- She's getting some tips

51:25.010 --> 51:26.110
from the other ninjas

51:26.110 --> 51:29.190
on the sidelines.

51:26.110 --> 51:29.190
She gets two more attempts.

51:29.190 --> 51:32.130
Karen Wiltin hasn't been

51:29.190 --> 51:32.130
ninja training that long.

51:32.130 --> 51:34.280
It's so impressive

51:32.130 --> 51:34.280
she's reached this point,

51:34.280 --> 51:37.280
and what an improvement

51:34.280 --> 51:37.280
over last year's city finals

51:37.280 --> 51:40.130
when she fell on

51:37.280 --> 51:40.130
the first obstacle.

51:40.130 --> 51:42.250
- Her daughters are watching,

51:40.130 --> 51:42.250
Etta and Mary

51:42.250 --> 51:44.210
watching Mama do her thing.

51:42.250 --> 51:44.210
Mama, there you go.

51:44.210 --> 51:47.110
- [indistinct].

51:44.210 --> 51:47.110
- Mama, there you go!

51:47.110 --> 51:48.170
- Ooh!

51:47.110 --> 51:48.170
- Oh, so close.

51:48.170 --> 51:49.250
- Inches away,

51:49.250 --> 51:52.030
down to her final attempt

51:49.250 --> 51:52.030
on the Warped Wall.

51:52.030 --> 51:53.110
- Come on, Karen.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.170
- Well, if it ends here,

51:54.170 --> 51:57.050
it's still a great run

51:54.170 --> 51:57.050
for Karen Wiltin,

51:57.050 --> 52:00.130
but every ninja dreams

51:57.050 --> 52:00.130
of getting up the Warped Wall.

52:00.130 --> 52:03.170
- You got this. She's got it.

52:00.130 --> 52:03.170
Let it go. Let it go.

52:03.170 --> 52:06.030
Let it go. Let it go.

52:03.170 --> 52:06.030
Let it go! Yes!

52:06.030 --> 52:09.150
- Yes!

52:06.030 --> 52:09.150
- Yes! Yes!

52:09.150 --> 52:11.130
Okay! Okay, Mama!

52:11.130 --> 52:14.010
- Yeah!

52:11.130 --> 52:14.010
- Okay, Mama!

52:14.010 --> 52:17.210
- What a moment

52:14.010 --> 52:17.210
for Karen Wiltin.

52:17.210 --> 52:19.260
- Yeah!

52:21.150 --> 52:23.260
- I'm sure mothers everywhere

52:23.260 --> 52:26.210
are celebrating

52:23.260 --> 52:26.210
right alongside her.

52:26.210 --> 52:28.260
What an accomplishment

52:26.210 --> 52:28.260
for a 41-year-old

52:28.260 --> 52:31.260
who's only been training

52:28.260 --> 52:31.260
a little over a year.

52:31.260 --> 52:34.010
- The ladies are taking it

52:31.260 --> 52:34.010
to the next level.

52:34.010 --> 52:36.010
Our third woman already

52:34.010 --> 52:36.010
to the back half.

52:36.010 --> 52:38.110
- Karen Wiltin now taking

52:36.010 --> 52:38.110
on the Salmon Ladder

52:38.110 --> 52:40.030
for the first time.

52:40.030 --> 52:41.230
Her daughters have to be

52:40.030 --> 52:41.230
so proud

52:41.230 --> 52:43.030
of their mom right now.

52:43.030 --> 52:45.170
But you have to wonder

52:43.030 --> 52:45.170
what does she have left

52:45.170 --> 52:48.190
after all those attempts

52:45.170 --> 52:48.190
on the Warped Wall?

52:48.190 --> 52:50.090
Oh!

52:48.190 --> 52:50.090
- Oh!

52:50.090 --> 52:52.130
Oh! She didn't get

52:50.090 --> 52:52.130
enough bounce!

52:52.130 --> 52:54.110
- Well, a tough way to end,

52:54.110 --> 52:58.210
but what a run

52:54.110 --> 52:58.210
for 41-year-old Karen Wiltin.

52:58.210 --> 53:00.150
- It took her three attempts,

53:00.150 --> 53:03.030
but Karen Wiltin

53:00.150 --> 53:03.030
got up the Warped Wall,

53:03.030 --> 53:07.010
a milestone for any ninja

53:03.030 --> 53:07.010
and one she'll never forget,

53:07.010 --> 53:09.000
and I think it wore out

53:07.010 --> 53:09.000
her legs

53:09.000 --> 53:10.150
because she got no bounce

53:10.150 --> 53:12.150
on the trampoline

53:10.150 --> 53:12.150
to the Salmon Ladder.

53:12.150 --> 53:15.170
Still an awesome run

53:12.150 --> 53:15.170
for Karen Wiltin.

53:15.170 --> 53:18.090
- And she's celebrating

53:15.170 --> 53:18.090
with the family.

53:18.090 --> 53:20.190
Two years ago

53:18.090 --> 53:20.190
she was on the couch,

53:20.190 --> 53:23.150
but look at Karen Wiltin

53:20.190 --> 53:23.150
tonight.

53:23.150 --> 53:26.190
Coming up,

53:23.150 --> 53:26.190
he's our biggest competitor,

53:26.190 --> 53:29.150
but he gets advice

53:26.190 --> 53:29.150
from his little guy.

53:29.150 --> 53:31.260
The Big Dog Jody Avila

53:29.150 --> 53:31.260
hits the course

53:31.260 --> 53:35.230
when we come back

53:31.260 --> 53:35.230
on "American Ninja Warrior."

53:40.090 --> 53:40.110
.

53:42.090 --> 53:43.130
- Welcome back to Oklahoma City

53:42.280 --> 53:43.130
and "American Ninja Warrior."

53:44.260 --> 53:48.090
It's been a night

53:44.260 --> 53:48.090
of amazing runs so far.

53:48.090 --> 53:51.150
Louisiana fishing

53:48.090 --> 53:51.150
store manager Chris Cambre

53:51.150 --> 53:54.190
always wears white

53:51.150 --> 53:54.190
shrimping boots on the course,

53:54.190 --> 53:57.170
and in his third season

53:54.190 --> 53:57.170
he finally made it

53:57.170 --> 54:00.030
far enough

53:57.170 --> 54:00.030
for the ultimate test.

54:00.030 --> 54:01.170
- Yeah!

54:01.170 --> 54:03.170
- We're gonna see those shrimp

54:01.170 --> 54:03.170
boots on the Warped Wall

54:03.170 --> 54:04.250
for the first time.

54:04.250 --> 54:07.090
all: Beat that wall!

54:04.250 --> 54:07.090
Beat that wall!

54:07.090 --> 54:09.000
- Cambre.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.130
- Ooh, oh, oh, oh!

54:09.000 --> 54:11.130
- Got it.

54:11.130 --> 54:13.150
[cheers and applause]

54:13.150 --> 54:15.110
- Ahh!

54:15.110 --> 54:16.280
The boots!

54:16.280 --> 54:19.090
- But seconds later

54:16.280 --> 54:19.090
the rubber boots

54:19.090 --> 54:22.230
gave him no bounce as he tried

54:19.090 --> 54:22.230
to reach the Salmon Ladder.

54:22.230 --> 54:24.070
- Oh, oh!

54:24.070 --> 54:27.190
- And the shrimp boots

54:24.070 --> 54:27.190
ended up in our bayou.

54:27.190 --> 54:30.250
Then it was Plano, Texas'

54:27.190 --> 54:30.250
Jonathan Bange,

54:30.250 --> 54:32.150
who was banging

54:30.250 --> 54:32.150
from the start.

54:32.150 --> 54:34.050
- Bang!

54:32.150 --> 54:34.050
- Bang! [laughs]

54:34.050 --> 54:36.210
- Let's go!

54:36.210 --> 54:38.250
- The muscular two-time

54:36.210 --> 54:38.250
ninja veteran

54:38.250 --> 54:41.000
was explosive on the course.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
- Okay!

54:43.000 --> 54:44.190
Uh-oh.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.190
- The shirt's coming off.

54:44.190 --> 54:47.050
- Uh-oh. He's got the Bruce

54:44.190 --> 54:47.050
Lee-inspired look going on!

54:47.050 --> 54:49.010
- Bang!

54:47.050 --> 54:49.010
- Bang!

54:49.010 --> 54:50.250
- Until, like so many others,

54:50.250 --> 54:54.030
his run was blown up

54:50.250 --> 54:54.030
by the Crazy Clocks.

54:54.030 --> 54:55.130
- Ooh!

54:55.130 --> 54:57.230
And boom, splash.

54:57.230 --> 54:59.250
- Bang!

54:59.250 --> 55:01.260
- Matt, we got a dog

54:59.250 --> 55:01.260
running wild

55:01.260 --> 55:03.130
on the course right now.

55:03.130 --> 55:07.150
- We're of course talking about

55:03.130 --> 55:07.150
the Big Dog, Jody Avila.

55:07.150 --> 55:11.110
He's our biggest competitor,

55:07.150 --> 55:11.110
6'6" and 210 pounds,

55:11.110 --> 55:13.280
and he's rolling through

55:11.110 --> 55:13.280
this course,

55:13.280 --> 55:15.210
no problem up the Warped Wall.

55:15.210 --> 55:17.030
- Okay, Big Dog!

55:17.030 --> 55:20.130
- And there's his wife

55:17.030 --> 55:20.130
Pauline and son Brandon.

55:20.130 --> 55:22.130
Jody's a heating

55:20.130 --> 55:22.130
and air-conditioning tech

55:22.130 --> 55:23.230
in the Houston area.

55:23.230 --> 55:25.170
It's his fourth season

55:23.230 --> 55:25.170
competing.

55:25.170 --> 55:28.210
He last qualified for Vegas

55:25.170 --> 55:28.210
two years ago.

55:28.210 --> 55:31.000
- He's never hit

55:28.210 --> 55:31.000
a finals buzzer before,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.090
and he wants to do it badly.

55:33.090 --> 55:36.010
Last year going out so early

55:33.090 --> 55:36.010
on the balance obstacle

55:36.010 --> 55:38.130
in qualifying,

55:36.010 --> 55:38.130
it really irritated him,

55:38.130 --> 55:40.210
and he really wants to hit

55:38.130 --> 55:40.210
that buzzer tonight.

55:40.210 --> 55:45.170
- Like a dog with a bone now.

55:40.210 --> 55:45.170
Let's see him on Crazy Clocks.

55:45.170 --> 55:47.170
Can he use that big frame,

55:45.170 --> 55:47.170
really exploding.

55:47.170 --> 55:48.230
- Ooh, nice.

55:48.230 --> 55:50.210
- Able to use

55:48.230 --> 55:50.210
those long arms.

55:50.210 --> 55:53.030
- He took a big kip

55:50.210 --> 55:53.030
on that one.

55:53.030 --> 55:55.110
Nice.

55:53.030 --> 55:55.110
Look at the big fella go!

55:55.110 --> 55:57.070
- And while the long arms

55:55.110 --> 55:57.070
help him,

55:57.070 --> 55:59.070
he's also carrying

55:57.070 --> 55:59.070
a lot of weight

55:59.070 --> 56:01.110
across these

55:59.070 --> 56:01.110
upper-body obstacles. Ooh.

56:01.110 --> 56:02.230
- Nice.

56:02.230 --> 56:04.010
- Gets onto

56:02.230 --> 56:04.010
the second handles.

56:04.010 --> 56:05.150
- 6'6", 210 pounds,

56:05.150 --> 56:07.070
that's not easy to do

56:05.150 --> 56:07.070
what he's doing.

56:07.070 --> 56:09.250
- Locked it in!

56:07.070 --> 56:09.250
Just needs the dismount,

56:09.250 --> 56:11.130
and he's through.

56:11.130 --> 56:14.130
This is the farthest

56:11.130 --> 56:14.130
he's ever gone on a course,

56:14.130 --> 56:16.190
and he's pointing

56:14.130 --> 56:16.190
to his son Brandon,

56:16.190 --> 56:19.050
his seven-year-old son

56:16.190 --> 56:19.050
who helps him train.

56:19.050 --> 56:21.230
- Love you!

56:19.050 --> 56:21.230
- Brandon says, "I love you,"

56:21.230 --> 56:23.130
right back to him.

56:23.130 --> 56:26.010
- But now he's got Snapback,

56:23.130 --> 56:26.010
and this is another one

56:26.010 --> 56:28.110
that's not gonna be easy

56:26.010 --> 56:28.110
with his size.

56:28.110 --> 56:31.030
- This Snapback has been

56:28.110 --> 56:31.030
a real challenge.

56:31.030 --> 56:34.130
Can Avila do it with his size?

56:34.130 --> 56:35.210
- Yes!

56:35.210 --> 56:39.150
- The Big Dog with the run

56:35.210 --> 56:39.150
of his life!

56:39.150 --> 56:41.050
- Makes the transfer.

56:41.050 --> 56:43.150
Jody Avila's not moving

56:41.050 --> 56:43.150
like a big guy.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.110
This is impressive.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.110
- Ah, hit it!

56:45.110 --> 56:47.250
- Yes! Gets the last one.

56:45.110 --> 56:47.250
- Come on!

56:47.250 --> 56:50.150
- Come on, Big Dog.

56:50.150 --> 56:52.030
And he's done it!

56:52.030 --> 56:54.110
[cheers and applause]

56:54.110 --> 56:57.190
And now he's 35 feet away

56:54.110 --> 56:57.190
from the buzzer,

56:57.190 --> 56:59.280
just has to climb

56:57.190 --> 56:59.280
the Spider Trap.

56:59.280 --> 57:02.050
- Hey, just like you did

56:59.280 --> 57:02.050
at the house, babe!

57:02.050 --> 57:03.210
- His wife Pauline says,

57:03.210 --> 57:05.130
"Just like you did

57:03.210 --> 57:05.130
at the house,"

57:05.130 --> 57:07.170
because the entire

57:05.130 --> 57:07.170
family practices

57:07.170 --> 57:10.170
that spider climb at home.

57:10.170 --> 57:13.190
- His wife, his son,

57:10.170 --> 57:13.190
they're all coaching him up.

57:13.190 --> 57:15.170
- Just like at home!

57:13.190 --> 57:15.170
Come on!

57:15.170 --> 57:17.250
- And we could have

57:15.170 --> 57:17.250
the Big Dog

57:17.250 --> 57:19.150
go against the Big Kat,

57:19.150 --> 57:21.280
Karsten Williams,

57:19.150 --> 57:21.280
on the Power Tower.

57:21.280 --> 57:24.150
Avila can beat the Cake Ninja,

57:21.280 --> 57:24.150
David Wright,

57:24.150 --> 57:26.110
for the second-fastest time.

57:26.110 --> 57:29.030
- But it's gonna be tight

57:26.110 --> 57:29.030
for him with those long legs.

57:29.030 --> 57:31.170
- He's been training for

57:29.030 --> 57:31.170
so long to get to this moment.

57:31.170 --> 57:33.130
- No problem with the doors.

57:33.130 --> 57:35.260
- He's got the long body,

57:33.130 --> 57:35.260
look at that long body,

57:35.260 --> 57:37.110
so he's gonna get going.

57:35.260 --> 57:37.110
Look at that.

- I see you, Spark-lay!

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:45.210
Hey, you so sparkly,

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:45.210
I can see you from over here.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:48.090
- Gotta love that smile,

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:48.090
but she knows

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.010
she has work to do here

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.010
on the Coconut Climb.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.260
Qualifying, she made it

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.260
all the way to the end

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.190
but couldn't get the dismount,

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.190
- Yeah, she can't get hung up

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.190
like last time

01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.010
and eat up too much time.

01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:59.190
all: Barclay! Barclay!

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:02.130
- And she is inching closer

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:02.130
to history.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:05.090
If we get four women up

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:05.090
the Warped Wall in one night,

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:08.050
it would be truly remarkable.

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:11.190
Well, she is tearing

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:11.190
through this Coconut Climb

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.070
and really making a point,

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.070
though,

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.110
of locking those elbows in

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.110
by her side there.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:16.190
Now they're extended.

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.030
That's okay

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.030
on the descent though.

01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:19.090
Just gotta kip it up.

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:20.170
- Yup.

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:20.170
- Very smooth.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.010
- Yeah, nice kip.

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:24.230
- Much more efficient out

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:24.230
of Barclay Stockett.

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:27.190
- But this is where she ran

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:27.190
into trouble in qualifying,

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:30.210
figuring out this dismount.

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:35.070
- She has to shift her body

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:35.070
over and grab that rope.

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:37.210
- Nice, get out of there.

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:37.210
- She got through it!

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:40.090
[cheers and applause]

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:42.170
Barclay Stockett survives.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:46.000
- I see you, Barclay! Yeah!

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.190
Matt, we got a lot of herstory

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.190
going on here in Oklahoma City.

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:52.070
- Well, I'll say.

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:52.070
We've already had three women

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:55.150
make it up the Warped Wall,

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:55.150
two moms and a rookie.

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:58.050
If Barclay can do it,

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:58.050
we'll have four,

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.090
the best night for women

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.090
in a city finals ever.

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:04.130
all: Beat that wall!

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:04.130
Beat that wall!

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.250
Beat that wall! Beat that wall!

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.050
- She's bringing the thunder

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.050
here in OKC.

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:10.210
- And she's done it!

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:13.000
What a night for the women.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.230
[cheers and applause]

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.210
But can't celebrate too long.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:18.230
She has to be aware

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:18.230
of the time.

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:20.260
Maggi Thorne reached

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:20.260
the Crazy Clocks

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.070
in four minutes, 24 seconds.

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:25.030
Barclay has to beat that

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:25.030
to get to Vegas

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:27.260
or complete the Crazy Clocks.

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.090
We know Barclay Stockett

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.090
feels right at home

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.090
on the Salmon Ladder.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:32.280
We've seen her dominate

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:32.280
the Salmon Ladder.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.110
We saw her do the

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.110
Super Salmon Ladder in Vegas.

01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:37.130
- Yeah, she did 28 rungs

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:39.050
only needs 4 right now.

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:42.050
Get your shine on, girl!

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:42.050
- And she's done it!

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:44.130
Just needs to touch

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:44.130
the Crazy Clocks.

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.110
Right there, and she's going

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.110
to the national finals

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.070
for the third straight year.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.260
Despite the best

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.260
run of her career,

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.230
Maggi Thorne is eliminated.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:57.050
Barclay's never finished

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:57.050
the eighth obstacle.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:58.230
Can she do it tonight?

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:01.150
- She's struggling to get that

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:01.150
left side around.

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:05.010
Her smaller arms don't help.

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:05.010
Now she's got it.

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:07.230
- This is a long transition

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:07.230
for the 5-foot-tall Stockett.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.050
- All right, come on

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.050
watch the grip.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:10.110
Watch the grip. Ooh, got it.

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:12.030
- Got it!

01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:12.030
- She's a [indistinct].

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.250
She's a gymnast. Look at that.

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.250
She's about to do this.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.090
- Jessie Graff, the only woman

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.150
ever to have

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.150
gotten past this obstacle.

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:20.230
- The women have amazed us

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:20.230
all night.

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.280
Come on, come on.

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.280
Come on, Barclay!

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.090
both: Oh!

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.050
The grip gives out.

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:29.070
She doesn't get

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:29.070
through the obstacle

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:32.130
but she does qualify

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:32.130
for the national finals,

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.250
and what a way to wrap up

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.250
a record-breaking night

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:37.070
for the women.

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:38.190
- Yeah, this was it.

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:41.110
Barclay becomes

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:41.110
the fourth woman to make it up

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:44.280
the Warped Wall tonight,

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:44.280
the most we've ever had,

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.260
and then she made it

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.260
to the final hands

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.190
on Crazy Clocks,

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.190
but watch her fingers.

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:53.010
She couldn't quite get a grip,

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:53.010
and her run was done.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.130
[splashing]

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:58.010
- And Barclay's

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:58.010
getting congratulations

01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:59.210
from family and friends.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:03.030
She's going to Vegas along

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:03.030
with rookie Taylor Amann,

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:06.010
the other woman to advance

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:06.010
from this region.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:11.170
Coming up,

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:11.170
he got the Mega Wall--yes!

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.110
- Whoo-hoo!

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:16.070
- And the Speed Pass.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:19.000
Daniel Gil wins it!

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.090
Now Daniel Gil

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.090
wants the Safety Pass.

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.230
Can he pull off the trifecta?

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:28.190
We'll see him next on

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:28.190
"American Ninja Warrior."

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:32.090
.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:34.250
- Welcome back to

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.250
"American Ninja Warrior"

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:38.150
and the Oklahoma city finals,

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:40.210
and while we were away,

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:40.210
two athletes who made it

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.170
to Vegas last year

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.170
tried to book

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:45.110
a return ticket

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:45.110
to the national finals.

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:49.110
Josh Norton is the janitor

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:49.110
at Iron Sports Gym in Houston.

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:52.170
- Whoo! Let's go!

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:56.000
- Tonight, with supporters

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:56.000
carrying plungers and mops,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.230
Norton made his way to

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.230
the back half of the course.

01:07:58.230 --> 01:08:00.260
- Yeah, mop it up. Mop it up.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:04.030
- But the 27-year-old

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:04.030
struggled on the Crazy Clocks

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.170
and needed

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.170
his own cleanup crew.

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:10.090
- Oh, he just wiped out like

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:10.090
the Anti-Norton virus!

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.190
- Abel Gonzalez

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.190
had a big group on hand

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:15.010
from his gym down

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:15.010
in Edinburg, Texas.

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:17.000
- Check out the Headband Crew.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.029
- The six-time veteran was

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.029
looking for his fourth trip

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.229
to the national finals.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.229
Excellent.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:23.109
- I see you, big boy.

01:08:23.109 --> 01:08:25.270
- But he needed to get through

01:08:23.109 --> 01:08:25.270
the Crazy Clocks to do it.

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:27.100
- Boy, you better

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:27.100
stay up there!

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.250
You better not fall!

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.250
We are all Abel!

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:31.149
We are all Abel! Come on!

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.220
- And after

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.220
a heartbreaking struggle,

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:36.109
he came up just short.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:37.180
both: No!

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:41.100
- Face-plant!

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:41.100
I thought he had it, Matt.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.270
[countdown clock beeping]

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:45.189
- Well, now we're really gonna

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:45.189
kick it into overdrive

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:48.020
as some of our speedsters

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:48.020
hit the course,

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.250
including the one

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.250
just starting.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.260
This is Matthew Day.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.260
the Texas A&M college student

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.260
who was second-fastest

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.140
in qualifying,

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.140
right behind Daniel Gil.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.189
- And he's coming out

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.189
hot again tonight.

01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:01.130
- Just 20 years old,

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.100
he was one

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.100
of last year's top rookies.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.130
He hit two buzzers and was

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.130
right there with Kid Owhadi.

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:09.020
- 20 seconds, and he's staring

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:09.020
at the fourth obstacle.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.140
That's pretty fast.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:13.050
- His parents and girlfriend

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:13.050
on the sideline.

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:15.020
They may have trouble

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:15.020
keeping up with him,

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:18.000
but don't rush through

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:18.000
these Diving Boards.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.140
And perfect balance.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.100
- 30 seconds, and he's

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.100
at the fifth obstacle.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.250
This is fast.

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:25.130
- Now the Coconut Climb,

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:25.130
which may slow him a little,

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:28.180
but clearly Matthew Day is

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:28.180
gunning for the fastest time.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:32.020
He lost out to Daniel Gil on

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:32.020
the Power Tower in qualifying.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.189
He wants to get back there

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.189
to win that Safety Pass.

01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:36.100
- Daniel Gil's coming up next.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.109
We could have a rematch

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.109
on the Power Tower.

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.180
- Matthew Day

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.180
still flying through this.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.149
- Oh! Oh, my goodness!

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:43.270
He rode that down

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:43.270
like a cowboy!

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:45.109
Oh!

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:49.050
- And Day is out!

01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:51.100
And that's

01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:51.100
how quickly things can end.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.220
The Coconut Climb takes out

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.220
one of the great ninjas,

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.220
Matthew Day,

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.220
just showing how there's no

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.220
room for error on this course.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.190
- He was cruising through this

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.190
course with the fastest time

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:06.170
to this point, but watch

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:06.170
on the Coconut Climb.

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:09.220
He wanted to stop on

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:09.220
the last cleat right there,

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.260
but he flew right over,

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.260
fell all the way down,

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.110
his back hit the water,

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.220
and Matthew Day

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.220
calls it a night.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.220
- Getting a hug

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.220
from his girlfriend.

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:21.100
Matthew Day's one of

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:21.100
the most talented ninjas,

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.220
but his season is over.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.140
But Day's fall could help

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:26.280
clear the way

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:26.280
to the Power Tower

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.050
for our next competitor.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.050
Zuri, get him started.

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:33.050
- Guys, Daniel Gil was dominant

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:33.050
in qualifying,

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.270
and tonight

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.270
he's going for perfection.

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:37.170
Now, he's got a shot tonight

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:39.250
to get what we're calling

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:39.250
the trifecta,

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:44.140
all three big prizes available

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:44.140
in city competition.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.090
- Yes!

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.090
- Yes! Yes!

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:49.250
- I already have

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:49.250
the Mega Wall...

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.230
- The perfect night continues!

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.210
[buzzer blares]

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:56.030
- And the Speed Pass,

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:56.030
but now I've got my eyes set

01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:58.280
on that Safety Pass.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.190
So watching Drew Drechsel

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.190
get the trifecta,

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.230
I said,

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.230
"That's my goal this season."

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.180
[cheers and applause]

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.020
- And there's Drew.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.260
He pulled off the trifecta

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.260
last week in Atlanta.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:15.030
He's here to support

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:15.030
his fellow ninjas tonight.

01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:18.000
Daniel will have

01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:18.000
his wife Abby, his mom,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.210
and lots of other friends

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.210
on the sideline.

01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:22.180
[countdown clock beeping]

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:24.180
- Don't blink,

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:24.180
'cause you might miss it.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.180
- Well, Gil was by far

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.180
the fastest in qualifying

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.230
even while running up

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.230
the Mega Wall.

01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:31.030
Because he won the Speed Pass,

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:33.030
his ticket to Vegas

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:33.030
is already punched.

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:34.190
He can just let it fly

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:37.060
and try to go back to

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:37.060
the Power Tower again tonight.

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:40.070
Gil can let it all hang out.

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:43.150
We saw Drechsel

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:43.150
do the same thing last week.

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:45.220
- And he's already got

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:45.220
the hair flying.

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.210
So far he's the fastest

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.210
to this point.

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:49.180
- Less than 30 seconds

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:49.180
and headed

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.000
to the fifth obstacle,

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.000
the Coconut Climb.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.100
- And if Daniel Gil

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.100
can get the Safety Pass,

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.270
he could be dangerous

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.270
in Vegas.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:58.140
- Well, he's fallen on

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:58.140
stage two the past two years.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.220
If he gets a second chance,

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.220
I bet he'll get through it

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.140
and he could win

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.140
a million dollars.

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.020
That's why he's running

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.020
so fast

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.010
right now,

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.010
and explosive power.

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:07.270
- Yeah, this--if you want

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:07.270
to see an efficient move,

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:09.070
this is textbook.

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.220
Daniel Gil definitely knows

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.220
how to do it.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.060
- But be careful here.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.030
This is where Matthew Day

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.030
just fell,

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.180
but no problem for Gil, and now

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.180
he's looking for the dismount.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:19.010
I gotta tell you,

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:23.220
Mount Midoriyama has got to be

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:23.220
shaking in its boots.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.090
He's under a minute

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.090
to this point,

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.190
the fastest we've seen anyone

01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:30.140
in qualifying or tonight

01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:30.140
in the city finals.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.230
- All right, here we go.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.230
- Gil going for broke

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:34.140
and making it look easy.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.250
It's a walk in the park

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.250
for the Kingdom Ninja.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:40.220
- He's yawning.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:40.220
A weird flex, but okay.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.050
- Taking a moment to visualize

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.050
the next couple of obstacles,

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:47.060
but he's on pace to destroy

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:47.060
the top finish of the night,

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.110
Karsten Williams.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.110
First up, the Salmon Ladder.

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:52.020
- He's got that body

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:52.020
and his hair,

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.140
and he's gotta take his body

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.140
up the Salmon Ladder.

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.170
- And just flies

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.170
right through it.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:00.000
Now it's the Crazy Clocks.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.100
This has knocked out

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.020
about a third

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.020
of our finalists tonight.

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.180
- Yeah, he's not even

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.180
at two minutes yet.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.110
Ooh, and, Matt, he almost hit

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.110
his mandible right there.

01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:12.060
Nice.

01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:12.060
- These last clock hands

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.020
are on an angle,

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.020
so a little more difficult,

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.170
but not for Daniel Gil,

01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:19.060
and he is through.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:22.090
[cheers and applause]

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:24.060
Well, literally almost

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.180
a minute faster

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.180
than anyone to this point.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.030
- Come on.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.030
- Let's go, Gil!

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.280
- Drew Drechsel was like this

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.280
last week in Atlanta,

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.140
but can Gil close it out

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.140
on these last two obstacles?

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.100
First up, it's Snapback.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:38.020
- All right, here we go.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.270
Don't sleep on Snapback,

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:41.180
'cause it will snap back

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:41.180
at you.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.000
Ooh, ooh!

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.000
- Oh, boy.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.070
- That was close.

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:45.250
- Come on, one more.

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:45.250
- Not perfect there.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.230
It is really--this is such

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.230
a challenging obstacle,

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:49.170
unlike anything

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:49.170
we've had before.

01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:52.060
- All right, you gotta see it.

01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:52.060
Timing, nice.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.220
- Talk about faith, hope.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.220
And Gil--

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.270
- Keep hope alive.

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:57.110
- Gil's gonna have

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:57.110
about a minute.

01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:59.180
He's gonna have over a minute.

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.110
- Let's go. Whoo!

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.010
- His training partner,

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.010
Kid Owhadi,

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:05.140
cheering him on.

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:05.140
The Kid will run next.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.030
- Oh, here goes Gil.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.130
I think we're definitely gonna

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.130
see him on the Power Tower.

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:12.060
- He's looking to obliterate

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:12.060
the fastest time.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:15.140
We'll see what the Kid can do,

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:15.140
but it could very easily

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.250
be Gil versus Owhadi

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.250
on the Power Tower.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:21.140
- Matt, that would be

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:21.140
some speed right there.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.250
And look at the Kid.

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:25.000
He's screaming and watching

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:25.000
Daniel Gil

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.180
do his thing!

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:30.140
- Daniel Gil,

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:34.110
the fastest time

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:34.110
by almost a minute.

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:35.270
- Really, Daniel Gil?

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.190
[cheers and applause]

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:41.220
- The Kingdom Ninja back

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:41.220
on the throne

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.100
with the fastest time

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.100
of the night.

01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:48.010
- Let's go!

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:50.090
- Throwing kisses to his wife,

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:53.090
and Daniel Gil's gonna have

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:53.090
one more race

01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:55.100
on the Power Tower.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.230
- Look at this.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.230
He banged his head

01:14:57.230 --> 01:15:00.060
on Snapback,

01:14:57.230 --> 01:15:00.060
and yet he held on,

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.030
and then he powered

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.030
to the top.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:05.170
He finished almost a minute

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:05.170
faster than Karsten Williams,

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:07.070
and in just a few minutes,

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:09.220
he's gonna race

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:09.220
for the Safety Pass.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.030
- So Daniel Gil's secured

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.030
his spot on the Power Tower.

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.110
Will he be racing his buddy,

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.110
the Kid?

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.100
We'll find out

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.100
when Mathis Owhadi runs next

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.210
on "American Ninja Warrior."

01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:24.100
.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:26.270
- Welcome back to

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:26.270
"American Ninja Warrior"

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.100
in Oklahoma City,

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.150
and it's our final runner

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.150
of the night.

01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:34.140
It's the Kid, Mathis Owhadi.

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.250
Last year,

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.250
he was a rock star rookie

01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:38.210
who made it to stage two.

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:41.000
This year, he's aiming

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:41.000
for the million dollars,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.250
but he also wants

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.250
a showdown on the Power Tower

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.250
with his friend

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.250
and mentor, Daniel Gil.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.020
[countdown clock beeping]

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.170
- It's real simple.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.190
He's gotta have one

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.190
of the two fastest finishes

01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:54.060
to get to that Power Tower,

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.060
so he's gonna have

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.060
to let it fly here.

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.050
- The Kid was part of

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.050
the first group

01:15:58.050 --> 01:16:00.020
of 19-year-olds last year,

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.150
and he went further

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.150
than any of them

01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:02.170
at the national finals.

01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:05.020
He became an instant star.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.060
He's a college student

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.060
at the University of Houston,

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:09.270
but when he's not on campus,

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:09.270
he's training for ninja,

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:13.010
- Matt, he started training

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:13.010
when he was just 13.

01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:16.100
That's why they call him

01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:16.100
the Kid.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.190
- Well, the Kid is flying

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.190
through this course.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.180
He learned to go fast

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.180
from two of the best,

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:25.020
those guys.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.230
Drew Drechsel was one of his

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.230
first coaches years ago,

01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:30.280
and now he trains every day

01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:30.280
with Daniel Gil.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.250
- Well, those are two pretty

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.250
good ninjas to learn from.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.270
- Kid already working

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.270
his way up Coconut Climb.

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:39.220
Now, he's 6'2",

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:39.220
taller than most ninjas.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:42.210
He's got a longer reach.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:42.210
He can use that here.

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:44.190
- Just look at him reach

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:44.190
across with ease.

01:16:44.190 --> 01:16:47.000
You can tell he wants

01:16:44.190 --> 01:16:47.000
that Power Tower, Matt.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.100
He wants a shot

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.100
at that Safety Pass.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.260
- It's gonna come down

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.260
to those final obstacles.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.110
Right now needs the dismount

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.110
though on Coconut Climb.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.170
- Just gotta avoid a mistake.

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:01.100
- And he's through.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.060
Yeah, buddy.

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.220
- Go get it.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.050
He has barely stopped

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.050
to catch his breath.

01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:11.030
He is on a mission,

01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:11.030
and he is moving.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.210
- And right up the Warped Wall.

01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:18.000
This kid is a ninja rock star.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.030
- You think he's not the big

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.030
man on campus back in Houston?

01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:24.050
And still only 20 years old.

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:27.020
- You got it.

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:27.020
- Daniel Gil offering support

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.210
even though he may have

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.210
to compete against Kid later,

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:31.100
but the Kid needs

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:31.100
to do his part,

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.070
needs to get at least

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.070
the second-fastest time.

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:35.170
Right now

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:35.170
that's Karsten Williams

01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:37.180
at four minutes, 29 seconds.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:39.140
Kid on the Salmon Ladder now.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.250
Three obstacles still to come

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.250
after this.

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:46.000
- Boom, no problem,

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:46.000
three obstacles to go.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.050
- But now the Crazy Clocks.

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:50.260
This has eliminated a third

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:50.260
of our finalists tonight.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.230
A little trouble

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.230
getting those handles up.

01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:54.170
Took him longer

01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:54.170
than he wanted.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.230
Now this big move over

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.230
to the board.

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:58.100
- Got it.

01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:02.070
- Keep breathing, Kid.

01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:02.070
Keep breathing.

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:05.060
- Daniel Gil offering advice.

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:05.060
I love it.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.140
Kid makes it

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.140
to the last clock.

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:09.140
- Barely made it on that one.

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:09.140
- All right,

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.030
Kid had a little trouble

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.030
with the handles,

01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:12.220
but look at that,

01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:12.220
powers those handles

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.270
right up to noon,

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.270
and he is through,

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.270
two more obstacles to go.

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:20.020
- Gil wants that showdown

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:20.020
on the Power Tower

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.250
as much as the Kid does.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:23.110
- Now on to an obstacle that

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:25.270
only four athletes

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:25.270
have cleared tonight,

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:27.130
Snapback.

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:28.250
- And that clock is ticking.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.050
This may be close.

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:34.220
- And this obstacle so tricky.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.270
- Ooh!

01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:38.000
- Barely makes

01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:38.000
that first grab.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.050
Now gotta get over

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.050
to the second one.

01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:43.130
Yes!

01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:43.130
One more big move here.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.110
Got it!

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:48.150
- Nice!

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:48.150
- And the tongue hanging out.

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:49.260
- Who is he, Michael Jordan?

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:51.020
- Here it is. Hold tight.

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:51.020
Hold tight. Hold tight.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.220
- Just needs the dismount.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.170
Yes!

01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:58.130
[cheers and applause]

01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:01.190
- And now only

01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:01.190
the 35-foot tower is left,

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:03.170
and he'll get

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:03.170
the dream matchup

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:05.100
with Daniel Gil

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:05.100
on the Power Tower.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.070
- Go!

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.070
- Yeah, listen to Daniel Gil.

01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:09.230
He needs to get moving.

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:12.100
The Spider Trap

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:12.100
can eat up a lot of time.

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.190
- Now, once he starts going,

01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.060
he's gonna have

01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.060
just under 30 seconds.

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.230
- Yeah, and that means

01:19:16.230 --> 01:19:18.180
he's gotta climb up this thing

01:19:16.230 --> 01:19:18.180
three seconds per 10 feet.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:21.140
- Those doors weigh

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:21.140
100 pounds each set.

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:22.220
- Come on, Kid!

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:22.220
- He's got to--

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.270
- Now he's picking up

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.270
the pace.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.060
- He's gotta go.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.060
He's gotta move it.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.220
- Second set.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.220
- M-O-V-E, move, Kid!

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.220
- Just under 20 seconds.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.220
- Come on, come on.

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.070
- And now 15 feet!

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:33.280
- Matt, I don't know

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:33.280
if he's aware of the time!

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.180
It's getting really close!

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.180
[inaudible]!

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.090
- He's just under ten seconds!

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.090
- Matt, that door's too heavy!

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:38.270
Go!

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:38.270
- But keep in mind--oh!

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.180
- Seven seconds!

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.180
He's gotta go!

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.060
- It's gonna be close!

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.060
- It's gonna be really close!

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.100
- Hit the buzzer, Kid!

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.100
- Hit it! Hit it!

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.100
[buzzer blares]

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.220

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.220
- Oh, my goodness!

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.140
- Whoo!

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.180
- Yeah!

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.060
- Whoo!

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.220
- He made it way

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.220
too close for comfort,

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.110
but the Kid did

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.110
what he wanted,

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:00.220
got into the top two,

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:00.220
and now

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:05.000
he's gonna have a duel with

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:05.000
Daniel Gil on the Power Tower.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.070
- Ahh!

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:08.190
- Well, let's look

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:08.190
at this run again.

01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.010
He had good hands on Snapback,

01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:13.280
but this really became

01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:13.280
a sprint up the Spider Trap.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.030
He got to the buzzer

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.030
less than half a second ahead

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.270
of Karsten Williams' time.

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:23.180
- So the night of historic

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:23.180
success in Oklahoma City draws

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:26.100
to a close,

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:26.100
but not before we have a duel

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.130
on our final obstacle,

the Power Tower,

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:29.260
where the stakes

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:29.260
are at their highest.

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.030
- That's right, Matt.

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:33.190
We've got two of

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:33.190
the fastest ninjas in the land,

01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:35.230

against his mentor,

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:38.000
Daniel Gil.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.270
- The Kid is 5 inches taller,

01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:41.230
so those

01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:41.230
longer arms could help,

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:44.110
but Gil has the edge

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:44.110
in experience.

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:47.100
He's competed three

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:47.100
more seasons than Owhadi.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.260
Very little time to rest.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.220
They are headed

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.220
to the start line,

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.220
and one of these guys will win

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.220
the Safety Pass,

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.000
a do-over

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.000
at the national finals.

01:21:01.210 --> 01:21:05.010
like having a Safety Pass.

01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.030
It will literally

01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.030
be a life saver.

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:09.100
That Safety Pass, it's mine.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.060
- Daniel Gil showed off

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.060

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:14.020

The perfect night continues!

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:18.230
But it's been redesigned

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:18.230
for the finals

01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:21.170
to really test

01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:21.170
upper-body strength.

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:24.020
There are 11 handholds

40 feet in the air.

- A Safety Pass

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.060

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.030

passed out fruits and veggies

before his run.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.260
