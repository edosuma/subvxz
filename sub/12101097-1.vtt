04:21.783 --> 04:23.088
-

06:08.106 --> 06:09.586
Alert the queen.

06:29.606 --> 06:30.564
Hyah!

09:00.322 --> 09:03.151
Bruce Vayne.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.935
Bruce Wayne.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.389
Talk.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.479
I believe there is a stranger.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.265
Comes to this village
from the sea.

09:30.439 --> 09:33.137
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.531
He brings fish.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.315
He comes on the king tide.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.665
That was last night.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.587
You have eyes, so see.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.545
Icebergs in the harbor.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.722
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

09:52.896 --> 09:56.857
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

10:03.907 --> 10:07.476
There are enemies
coming from far away.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.479
I need warriors.

10:10.653 --> 10:14.178
This stranger,
others like him.

10:14.352 --> 10:18.618
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.621
It's very important
that I see this man.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.146
If this stranger exists,

10:25.320 --> 10:27.365
he'll give him your message.

10:27.539 --> 10:28.758
$5,000 American.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.717
Look, I'll give you $25,000

10:30.891 --> 10:33.720
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

10:45.775 --> 10:50.780
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

10:50.954 --> 10:54.566
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.569
We are poor, not stupid.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.441
Get out.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.096
I'm sorry.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.880
Can't do that.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.143
I'll leave after we've spoken.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.323
He said, "Get out."

11:18.678 --> 11:21.028
-

11:31.429 --> 11:33.301
Arthur Curry.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.173
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.523
The Aquaman.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.009
So, let me
get this straight.

11:46.183 --> 11:49.621
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

11:49.796 --> 11:51.449
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.495
Oh, that shithole.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.453
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.152
-Don't count on it, Batman.
-Why not?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.154
'Cause I don't like
you coming here,
digging into my business

12:00.328 --> 12:02.809
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.767
Is that why you do this?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.247
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

12:06.421 --> 12:07.683
I've read the stories.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.859
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.513
You'll join us.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.384
"Strong man
is strongest alone."

12:13.558 --> 12:15.082
You ever heard that?

12:15.256 --> 12:16.605
You ever hear
of Superman?

12:16.779 --> 12:18.302
He died fighting next to me.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.088
My point exactly.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.394
He believed
we were stronger together.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.135
We owe it to him.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.529
I don't owe anyone anything.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.844
Dressed like a bat.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.759
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.544
Move over, Dusty.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.559
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.

15:08.733 --> 15:13.086
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

15:13.260 --> 15:15.479
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.264
Costa Rica's nice.

15:17.438 --> 15:18.830
I found him.

15:21.703 --> 15:24.053
He said no.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.229
So the draft stands
at naught for two?

15:28.753 --> 15:31.495
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

15:31.669 --> 15:35.064
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?

15:54.823 --> 15:56.520
That's $10, please.

16:34.819 --> 16:35.733
Good morning, Miss Lane.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.170
Jerry, hi.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.955
Wow.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.348
You don't miss a day, do you?

16:42.827 --> 16:44.742
Like it here.

16:50.748 --> 16:57.842
would outlive us

16:58.017 --> 17:03.805
would outlive us

17:06.503 --> 17:12.509
would outlive us

18:30.370 --> 18:31.371
- Excuse me.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.633
-

18:32.807 --> 18:34.025
- Move!

18:44.906 --> 18:46.255
Move it! Move it!

18:52.609 --> 18:55.221
No, mate, don't shoot!
-Move, move!

18:55.395 --> 18:56.831
Get the fuck
over there!

18:58.876 --> 19:00.356
Move! All of ya!

19:11.062 --> 19:12.977
Line them up
along the wall.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.893
Keep them quiet.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.331
Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

19:18.505 --> 19:19.854
Shut them up too!

19:23.031 --> 19:25.512
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.557
Until then,
if I see any movement,

19:27.731 --> 19:29.603
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.272
Should I take him?

19:46.446 --> 19:47.969
Hold your fire.

19:49.579 --> 19:50.537
They've got kids in there.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.323
Yeah,
he's not bluffing, chief.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.630
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.525
Quiet! Shut up!

20:27.704 --> 20:29.967
Down with the modern world.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.621
Back to the Dark Ages.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.106
Quiet!

20:40.195 --> 20:42.763
I said
shut your fucking mouth.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.735
-Who are you?

20:58.909 --> 21:01.608
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.480
Now, who are you?

21:04.654 --> 21:07.614
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

21:07.788 --> 21:09.442
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

21:09.616 --> 21:11.835
-a thousand years.
-Boring. Why the hostages?

21:12.009 --> 21:13.620
We have no demands.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.317
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.188
While you do what?

21:17.363 --> 21:21.192
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.718
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...

21:26.328 --> 21:28.939
...while the world watches.

22:42.752 --> 22:45.755
-

23:08.735 --> 23:10.040
No!

23:10.214 --> 23:11.738
Like lambs
to the slaughter.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.528
I don't believe it.

24:02.702 --> 24:03.659
Believe it.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.176
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

24:42.350 --> 24:44.570
Good. It's okay.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.789
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.269
It's all good.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.184
It's over now.
Are you okay?

24:50.358 --> 24:52.491
You okay? Good.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.410
Are you okay, princess?

25:02.936 --> 25:04.633
Can I be like you someday?

25:06.896 --> 25:09.464
You can be anything
you want to be.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.686
Come on. Let's go.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.773
Any changes today?

25:57.947 --> 25:59.383
No, my Queen.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.039
The Mother Box has awoken,

26:03.213 --> 26:06.129
yet nothing has happened.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.305
It has slept
for thousands of years

26:08.479 --> 26:10.438
since the First Age.

26:10.612 --> 26:11.874
Why did it wake at all?

26:19.882 --> 26:21.623
This is the first time
it's gone quiet

26:21.797 --> 26:23.016
since the crack appeared.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.758
Maybe it's going
back to sleep.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.590
Evil does not sleep.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.505
It waits.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.857
Something is coming.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.559
Prepare for battle!

27:10.672 --> 27:12.761
Amazons,
on your marks!

27:12.935 --> 27:14.197
Ready!

27:39.440 --> 27:41.442
Defenders.

27:43.139 --> 27:47.709
They have failed
100,000 worlds.

27:47.883 --> 27:49.319
They always fail.

27:51.365 --> 27:56.022
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

27:56.196 --> 27:59.025
I will bathe in your fear.

28:00.591 --> 28:03.029
Daughters of Themyscira,

28:04.421 --> 28:05.988
show him your fear!

28:06.162 --> 28:08.512
We have no fear!

28:27.836 --> 28:29.403
Gather the legions!

28:30.404 --> 28:31.535
Go with her!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.059
You must seal the cage!

28:33.233 --> 28:35.365
-Go!
-Phillipus!

29:02.175 --> 29:03.219
No!

29:15.884 --> 29:16.885
Behind you!

29:20.889 --> 29:22.325
Ahhh!

29:24.327 --> 29:25.502
Epione.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.463
Honor us. It's right.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.772
Seal it.

29:39.081 --> 29:41.605
Ready the hammers!

29:53.922 --> 29:56.011
Seal it now!

31:30.453 --> 31:32.151
Guard it with your life.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.935
-Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.458
Hyah! Hyah!

32:51.317 --> 32:52.927
-

32:58.889 --> 33:00.587
- Hyah!

33:04.721 --> 33:06.462
-

34:20.101 --> 34:21.624
Got it! Go!

34:22.799 --> 34:24.192
Hyah!

34:24.366 --> 34:26.281
-

34:44.604 --> 34:48.695
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?

34:51.828 --> 34:53.569
You can't save her.

34:53.743 --> 34:56.137
You can't save any of them.

34:59.706 --> 35:03.753
The great darkness begins.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.581
Amazons!

35:15.852 --> 35:18.420
Yes, we will find the others.

35:20.379 --> 35:22.816
-Draw!
-

35:25.035 --> 35:26.428
Loose!

35:31.651 --> 35:33.653
-

36:24.312 --> 36:26.184
He's gone back
to his universe.

36:26.358 --> 36:27.315
No.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.320
He's gone to the lands of men

36:32.494 --> 36:35.671
to find the other two boxes.

36:35.845 --> 36:38.892
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

36:39.066 --> 36:42.504
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.158
Men won't know what it means.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.378
Men won't.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.555
She will.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.236
-

37:20.325 --> 37:22.936
It's toxic.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.807
That's good.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.003
Go!

37:47.177 --> 37:49.136
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.877
Find the missing two.

37:51.051 --> 37:54.924
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.797
This world
will join the others.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.757
He will be pleased.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.804
He will see my worth again.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.287
Hey.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.985
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

38:12.159 --> 38:13.552
Possibly.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.598
"Possibly."

38:16.772 --> 38:19.340
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."

38:19.514 --> 38:22.082
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.783
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

38:27.957 --> 38:30.264
our disappearing man.

38:30.438 --> 38:35.138
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.618
Might be
another false positive,

38:36.792 --> 38:38.228
you'll have to give me
a little time

38:38.403 --> 38:40.535
-to confirm.
-We don't have any more time.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.060
Master Wayne,

38:44.234 --> 38:46.454
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

38:46.628 --> 38:47.716
to build this team

38:47.890 --> 38:49.718
of people you can't even find.

38:49.892 --> 38:52.025
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.201
Just because Lex Luthor says

38:54.375 --> 38:56.159
the planet's
in danger of attack?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.292
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

38:58.466 --> 38:59.815
It has to do with him.

38:59.989 --> 39:03.993
I made a promise to him
on his grave.

39:04.167 --> 39:07.301
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

39:07.475 --> 39:10.870
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.699
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

39:13.873 --> 39:18.094
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

39:18.268 --> 39:21.576
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.361
Maybe they're already here.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.105
Keep looking.
What else do you have?

40:08.188 --> 40:09.711
Lab's all yours, Howard.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.452
11:30.

40:11.626 --> 40:12.975
Early night for you, Silas.

40:13.149 --> 40:15.717
Yes, early night.

40:15.891 --> 40:16.936
Tell your family I said hello.

40:52.362 --> 40:53.929
What the...

40:57.890 --> 40:58.978
Jesus.

42:12.312 --> 42:15.054
The Arrow of Artemis.

42:15.228 --> 42:17.665
It will reach
the lands of men.

42:27.370 --> 42:28.676
Sky torch,

42:28.850 --> 42:30.373
hero beacon,

42:30.548 --> 42:32.288
scatter the darkness.

42:32.462 --> 42:35.640
Burn as you burned
in days before.

42:37.293 --> 42:41.080
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.

42:41.254 --> 42:44.779
Warn my daughter
that war has come

42:46.215 --> 42:47.869
and protect her.

43:12.633 --> 43:14.896
Return to me, Diana.

43:53.587 --> 43:56.372
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

43:56.546 --> 43:58.810
Nothing very interesting.

43:58.984 --> 44:01.464
That's all you ever tell us.

44:01.639 --> 44:05.120
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

44:05.294 --> 44:09.211
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

44:13.563 --> 44:14.564
Again?

44:14.739 --> 44:16.828
-What is it?
-Now what?

44:17.002 --> 44:20.135
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

44:20.309 --> 44:22.747
Now add to the list "arson."

44:24.705 --> 44:26.533
Yes, good morning

44:28.448 --> 44:29.797
As you can see behind me,

44:29.971 --> 44:32.060
an enormous bonfire
is burning.

44:32.234 --> 44:34.323
This fire has been burning
through the night.

44:34.497 --> 44:35.934
We're now into the morning

44:36.108 --> 44:38.284
and we are
at least five miles away.

44:38.458 --> 44:41.809
And we can still
see it burning as we speak.

44:41.983 --> 44:44.986
This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike

44:45.160 --> 44:46.988
here at this historical site

44:47.162 --> 44:49.687
of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.

44:49.861 --> 44:51.601
Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to

44:51.776 --> 44:53.691
-what may have caused this.
-Invasion.

45:02.917 --> 45:04.049
Ryan.

45:04.223 --> 45:05.528
-Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

45:05.703 --> 45:07.661
No damage
to the electron-laser.

45:07.835 --> 45:09.837
-Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
-Yeah.

45:10.011 --> 45:11.839
-Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

45:12.013 --> 45:14.233
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

45:14.407 --> 45:16.017
They took
whatever was in here.

45:16.191 --> 45:19.891
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

45:20.065 --> 45:22.850
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.

45:23.024 --> 45:26.767
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.

45:26.941 --> 45:29.030
Mmm-hmm.
-What was it?

45:29.204 --> 45:30.162
I don't know.

45:30.336 --> 45:31.816
You don't know?

45:31.990 --> 45:33.600
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.

45:33.774 --> 45:35.558
What's your rank, Doctor?

45:35.733 --> 45:37.691
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?

45:37.865 --> 45:39.475
-Sure. Okay.
-Thanks.

45:39.649 --> 45:41.956
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.

45:42.130 --> 45:43.262
We work for the DoD.

45:43.436 --> 45:46.221
We advise them
on xeno-science.

45:46.395 --> 45:47.875
"Xeno-science"?

45:48.049 --> 45:49.790
Alien technology.

45:56.971 --> 45:59.060
For example,

45:59.234 --> 46:00.758
the Superman ship.

46:09.114 --> 46:10.506
Eight people

46:10.680 --> 46:12.204
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

46:12.378 --> 46:13.596
Cleaning staff, guards,

46:13.771 --> 46:15.598
a few of
your research scientists.

46:15.773 --> 46:16.774
They were abducted.

46:18.166 --> 46:19.341
Are you sure?

46:19.515 --> 46:21.909
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.

46:22.083 --> 46:25.130
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

46:28.176 --> 46:32.485
Any idea who
or what that might be?

46:52.679 --> 46:54.637
The box
isn't safe here.

46:57.205 --> 46:58.728
Victor,

46:58.903 --> 47:01.166
they came looking for it
at the lab.

47:01.340 --> 47:05.692
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.

47:08.477 --> 47:10.349
You know a lot about monsters,

47:11.089 --> 47:12.438
don't you?

47:18.879 --> 47:21.534
Especially how to make 'em.

47:23.971 --> 47:25.930
-

50:19.016 --> 50:21.409
-

50:21.583 --> 50:25.152
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

50:27.067 --> 50:30.070
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.

50:35.423 --> 50:37.425
Mayday!

50:37.599 --> 50:39.601
Is there anybody out there?

50:44.998 --> 50:46.043
Ahh!

51:19.946 --> 51:21.556
Whiskey.

51:30.435 --> 51:32.915
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.

51:42.142 --> 51:43.100
It's on him.

54:11.378 --> 54:13.511
King who would be man.

54:13.685 --> 54:16.731
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

54:17.689 --> 54:19.473
All the time I've wasted

54:19.647 --> 54:22.607
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

54:24.783 --> 54:26.219
Are you finished,
old man?

54:26.393 --> 54:28.613
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

54:28.787 --> 54:31.442
yet you keep coming back here.

54:33.487 --> 54:35.446
I like it. It's quiet.

54:35.620 --> 54:37.404
It's your inheritance.

54:37.578 --> 54:39.624
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.

54:40.842 --> 54:41.930
Our people suffer.

54:42.104 --> 54:44.106
Your people.

54:44.281 --> 54:47.806
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.156
Is the surface any different?

54:50.330 --> 54:52.289
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.

54:53.377 --> 54:55.509
What do you want, Vulko?

54:55.683 --> 54:56.945
Guards near
the stronghold

54:57.119 --> 54:58.556
have been disappearing.

54:58.730 --> 55:00.122
Snatchers from above.

55:00.297 --> 55:01.559
Talk to King Orm.

55:01.733 --> 55:03.387
Your brother?
-Half-brother.

55:03.561 --> 55:06.477
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

55:06.651 --> 55:09.393
He lies.

55:09.567 --> 55:11.569
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

55:11.743 --> 55:14.223
They're looking for it.

55:14.398 --> 55:18.532
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

55:18.706 --> 55:21.013
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.

55:21.187 --> 55:22.623
Protect the box.

55:23.711 --> 55:24.843
The time has come.

55:27.062 --> 55:28.977
Take up your mother's trident.

55:40.249 --> 55:43.862
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

55:44.819 --> 55:47.779
Above or below.

56:17.025 --> 56:18.592
DeSaad.

56:18.766 --> 56:22.640
DeSaad! I call to thee.

56:31.823 --> 56:36.915
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

56:37.089 --> 56:40.092
This world is divided.

56:40.266 --> 56:41.746
They are a primitive species.

56:41.920 --> 56:44.226
Unevolved and at war
with one another.

56:44.401 --> 56:47.273
Too separate to be one.

56:47.447 --> 56:49.667
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

56:49.841 --> 56:51.669
like the other worlds.

56:51.843 --> 56:55.977
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,

56:56.151 --> 56:57.805
to serve him.

56:58.632 --> 57:00.982
The Mother Boxes?

57:01.156 --> 57:04.072
I have found one of the three.

57:04.246 --> 57:06.684
The one that woke
and called to me.

57:06.858 --> 57:08.381
The other two still sleep,

57:08.555 --> 57:12.341
but the parademons
feel their presence.

57:12.516 --> 57:14.126
They fly,

57:14.300 --> 57:17.782
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,

57:17.956 --> 57:22.743
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

57:23.352 --> 57:25.224
Yes.

57:26.312 --> 57:30.359
Mighty Steppenwolf,

57:30.534 --> 57:34.842
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

57:36.801 --> 57:41.327
But undone by his self-pride.

57:42.546 --> 57:43.895
DeSaad...

57:45.026 --> 57:47.986
I fall before you.

57:48.160 --> 57:49.944
Let me make a plea to him

57:50.118 --> 57:52.033
that I may come home

57:52.207 --> 57:54.993
after I take this world
in his name.

57:55.167 --> 57:57.517
You betrayed him.

57:58.997 --> 58:00.477
Your own family.

58:00.651 --> 58:02.870
I saw my mistake.

58:03.044 --> 58:05.656
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

58:05.830 --> 58:10.835
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

58:12.010 --> 58:14.142
He will hear your plea

58:14.316 --> 58:16.493
when you pay your debt.

58:19.496 --> 58:22.499
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

58:23.456 --> 58:25.589
No protectors here.

58:25.763 --> 58:29.201
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

58:29.375 --> 58:32.944
This world will fall,
like all the others.

58:34.032 --> 58:35.729
For Darkseid.

58:38.993 --> 58:41.169
For Darkseid.

59:02.495 --> 59:04.366
You know,
I paid millions of dollars

59:04.541 --> 59:06.064
for this building's security.

59:06.238 --> 59:07.848
You got
your money's worth.

59:08.022 --> 59:10.372
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.

59:11.939 --> 59:13.201
Hi there.

59:14.899 --> 59:15.900
A new toy?

59:16.857 --> 59:18.946
Prototype troop carrier.

59:20.687 --> 59:22.210
I once knew a man

59:22.384 --> 59:24.822
who would have loved
to fly it.

59:24.996 --> 59:26.693
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace

59:26.867 --> 59:27.912
couldn't make it fly.

59:29.043 --> 59:30.610
But you can?

59:30.784 --> 59:32.481
I have no choice.

59:32.656 --> 59:35.397
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.356
I think
there's an attack coming.

59:37.530 --> 59:39.271
Not coming, Bruce.

59:40.098 --> 59:42.666
It's already here.

59:42.840 --> 59:44.668
From what I've learned,

59:44.842 --> 59:47.366
they are things
from another universe.

59:47.540 --> 59:49.890
They serve a dark power.

59:50.064 --> 59:51.762
An old power.

59:51.936 --> 59:53.285
What do they want?

59:53.459 --> 59:57.506
To invade.
To conquer.

59:57.681 --> 1:00:01.815
They came here once before,
long ago.

1:00:07.038 --> 1:00:09.475
A great armada
appeared in the sky,

1:00:09.649 --> 1:00:12.304
laying waste
to all who opposed it.

1:00:12.478 --> 1:00:16.525
The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.

1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:21.661
A name cursed and feared
in every universe.

1:00:21.835 --> 1:00:25.622
Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.

1:00:25.796 --> 1:00:28.755
The old gods, men...

1:00:28.929 --> 1:00:31.932
Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...

1:00:34.369 --> 1:00:38.330
Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement

1:00:38.504 --> 1:00:40.854
and guardians from the stars.

1:00:41.028 --> 1:00:42.856
Their histories
had taught them

1:00:43.030 --> 1:00:44.597
not to trust each other,

1:00:44.771 --> 1:00:46.947
not to hope for an alliance.

1:00:47.121 --> 1:00:49.080
To fight apart.

1:01:38.216 --> 1:01:40.871
As Darkseid
waged war on Earth,

1:01:41.045 --> 1:01:42.481
he found a secret there.

1:01:42.655 --> 1:01:46.398
A power hidden
in the infinity of space.

1:01:46.572 --> 1:01:48.226
He called forth mystics

1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:51.359
who worshipped and controlled
three objects...

1:01:51.533 --> 1:01:52.709
the Mother Boxes.

1:01:52.883 --> 1:01:54.275
Wait, wait, wait.

1:01:54.449 --> 1:01:55.537
"Mother Boxes"?

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:58.758
Indestructible
living machines,

1:01:58.932 --> 1:02:01.456
made from a science
so advanced,

1:02:01.630 --> 1:02:03.850
it looks like sorcery.

1:02:04.024 --> 1:02:06.635
To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize

1:02:06.810 --> 1:02:10.074
and join together
into The Unity.

1:02:10.248 --> 1:02:13.294
The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,

1:02:13.468 --> 1:02:17.037
transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.

1:02:17.211 --> 1:02:20.649
All who live
become servants of Darkseid.

1:02:20.824 --> 1:02:23.783
Alive but drained of life.

1:02:23.957 --> 1:02:25.263
Parademons.

1:02:26.743 --> 1:02:28.570
-Amazons!
-

1:02:34.446 --> 1:02:36.143
With me!

1:03:05.564 --> 1:03:08.001
But before The Unity
could synchronize,

1:03:08.175 --> 1:03:10.134
the defenders of Earth
attacked

1:03:10.308 --> 1:03:11.962
and fought as one.

1:03:12.136 --> 1:03:15.139
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.

1:03:15.313 --> 1:03:16.967
Zeus and his son Ares

1:03:17.141 --> 1:03:20.666
alongside the guardians
from the sky.

1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:23.887
A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together

1:03:24.061 --> 1:03:25.453
to defend life on Earth.

1:05:22.179 --> 1:05:24.964
They did what no world
had ever done.

1:05:25.138 --> 1:05:27.184
Sent the enemies
back into the stars.

1:05:29.838 --> 1:05:33.494
The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.

1:05:36.976 --> 1:05:39.674
But, in their retreat,

1:05:39.848 --> 1:05:42.982
the boxes were left behind
on Earth.

1:05:43.156 --> 1:05:46.812
They grew weak.
Dogs without masters

1:05:48.683 --> 1:05:50.250
falling asleep,

1:05:50.424 --> 1:05:52.905
awaiting their return.

1:05:53.079 --> 1:05:55.386
Fading from the view
of the enemy,

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:58.693
anonymous
among a trillion worlds.

1:06:15.623 --> 1:06:18.975
The defenders of Earth
made a vow.

1:06:19.149 --> 1:06:22.413
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.

1:06:22.587 --> 1:06:24.371
Each would enshrine and guard

1:06:24.545 --> 1:06:26.504
one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes

1:06:26.678 --> 1:06:30.160
according to the rites
and rituals of their culture

1:06:30.334 --> 1:06:32.989
in case a box
should ever wake again

1:06:33.163 --> 1:06:34.773
to call out
to the planet Apokolips

1:06:34.947 --> 1:06:36.688
to return and conquer

1:06:36.862 --> 1:06:40.605
the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.

1:07:56.594 --> 1:07:59.814
Something woke the box
my people guard.

1:07:59.988 --> 1:08:02.034
It called out
to the dark place...

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:04.515
to one of Darkseid's
conquerors.

1:08:05.516 --> 1:08:07.735
The enemy is here.

1:08:07.909 --> 1:08:09.563
If he's here, where is he?

1:08:09.737 --> 1:08:11.826
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.960
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

1:08:15.134 --> 1:08:19.573
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

1:08:19.747 --> 1:08:22.533
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

1:08:22.707 --> 1:08:24.100
No, it will.

1:08:24.274 --> 1:08:25.971
It has to.

1:08:27.755 --> 1:08:31.194
The others.
Where are they?

1:08:53.259 --> 1:08:54.304
Am I late?

1:08:54.478 --> 1:08:56.784
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.

1:08:56.958 --> 1:08:58.525
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

1:08:58.699 --> 1:09:00.397
-Oh. No.
-

1:09:00.571 --> 1:09:03.443
- Okay, bye. Okay.

1:09:03.617 --> 1:09:05.750
-I'm so sorry.
-

1:09:05.924 --> 1:09:07.143
I'm late.

1:09:12.713 --> 1:09:14.367
-Are you, uh...
-I'm...

1:09:14.541 --> 1:09:16.195
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

1:09:16.369 --> 1:09:17.849
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

1:09:18.023 --> 1:09:19.067
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,

1:09:19.242 --> 1:09:20.417
then the bus did come,

1:09:20.591 --> 1:09:21.548
but then there was
this old woman

1:09:21.722 --> 1:09:22.941
counting change for the fare,

1:09:23.115 --> 1:09:24.551
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.

1:09:24.725 --> 1:09:25.857
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

1:09:26.031 --> 1:09:27.554
She's 107 years old,

1:09:27.728 --> 1:09:28.816
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

1:09:28.990 --> 1:09:30.296
Resume.

1:09:30.470 --> 1:09:31.428
Resume.

1:09:34.779 --> 1:09:36.650
Come on.

1:09:36.824 --> 1:09:38.522
-

1:09:39.175 --> 1:09:40.263
Come on.

1:09:40.437 --> 1:09:42.090
From the French, of course.

1:09:42.265 --> 1:09:45.137
"Resume,"I believe,
is a past participle of...

1:09:50.621 --> 1:09:52.449
Uh, wow. That's no good.

1:09:52.623 --> 1:09:54.146
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:56.844
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh...

1:09:59.499 --> 1:10:01.066
-

1:10:05.113 --> 1:10:07.681
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.

1:10:14.079 --> 1:10:15.298
-Yes.

1:10:24.394 --> 1:10:26.787
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

1:10:26.961 --> 1:10:27.962
You said you had experience

1:10:28.136 --> 1:10:29.137
walking dogs.

1:10:40.453 --> 1:10:42.803
-

1:11:35.595 --> 1:11:41.862
and fingers

1:11:51.089 --> 1:11:57.922
you dreamed about me?

1:11:58.096 --> 1:12:05.321
when I was forced out?

1:12:05.495 --> 1:12:11.979
is leaning

1:12:12.153 --> 1:12:19.073
on your rocks

1:12:21.032 --> 1:12:27.081
Here I am

1:13:09.646 --> 1:13:11.691
Oh, gosh,
I hope everyone's okay.

1:13:11.865 --> 1:13:14.390
See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,

1:13:14.564 --> 1:13:16.566
I always bring a meat snack.

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:18.655
'Cause it makes them
feel calm.

1:13:18.829 --> 1:13:20.178
'Cause you never know
what's going to happen
in this city.

1:13:20.352 --> 1:13:21.919
I mean, oh, my gosh.

1:13:22.093 --> 1:13:24.574
Right? I start on Monday?

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:05.528
You have been
near a Mother Box.

1:14:06.833 --> 1:14:09.227
The scent is on you.

1:14:09.401 --> 1:14:10.968
Where is it?

1:14:11.142 --> 1:14:14.537
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

1:14:29.595 --> 1:14:31.162
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box

1:14:31.336 --> 1:14:32.380
for thousands of years.

1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:35.949
-

1:14:38.604 --> 1:14:41.172
I will never betray
my own people.

1:14:52.749 --> 1:14:55.186
You already have.

1:15:55.638 --> 1:15:58.249
This was taken in
the deepest trench on Earth.

1:15:58.423 --> 1:16:00.468
He must be an Atlantean.

1:16:00.643 --> 1:16:02.209
A water-breather.

1:16:02.383 --> 1:16:03.602
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

1:16:03.776 --> 1:16:05.561
Mixed-blood, then.

1:16:05.735 --> 1:16:07.606
He said he'll fight with us?

1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:09.086
More or less.

1:16:10.478 --> 1:16:12.829
More more or more less?

1:16:13.003 --> 1:16:14.004
Probably more less.

1:16:14.178 --> 1:16:16.267
-He said no?
-He said no.

1:16:16.441 --> 1:16:18.878
Atlanteans
can be tricky.

1:16:19.052 --> 1:16:21.707
My people went to war
with them once.

1:16:22.926 --> 1:16:24.884
I'm not sure we can trust him.

1:16:25.058 --> 1:16:26.190
Diana,
if we're gonna do this,

1:16:26.364 --> 1:16:27.452
you're gonna need to be open

1:16:27.626 --> 1:16:28.714
to more things
that we didn't...

1:16:28.888 --> 1:16:30.194
you know...

1:16:30.368 --> 1:16:31.630
-I'm sorry. That's okay.
-Sorry. My fault.

1:16:31.804 --> 1:16:32.892
Don't worry about it.

1:16:33.066 --> 1:16:34.328
Let's...
-It happens.

1:16:34.502 --> 1:16:36.069
so...
-

1:16:36.243 --> 1:16:37.505
This is the
third person.

1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:40.073
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.

1:16:40.247 --> 1:16:41.727
One frame of video, see?

1:16:41.901 --> 1:16:44.425
Barry Allen. Central City.

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:45.513
Go to him.

1:16:45.688 --> 1:16:47.428
I'll work on number four.

1:16:47.603 --> 1:16:50.649
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.

1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:55.219
He's a cyborg.

1:17:14.412 --> 1:17:16.327
Ready!
- Break!

1:17:31.864 --> 1:17:33.083
Three...

1:17:33.257 --> 1:17:34.737
eighty...

1:17:35.868 --> 1:17:37.914
set... go!

1:17:51.275 --> 1:17:53.494
Your son may be captain
of the football team

1:17:53.669 --> 1:17:56.628
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone...

1:17:56.802 --> 1:17:58.804
Dr. Stone.

1:18:01.459 --> 1:18:03.461
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

1:18:03.635 --> 1:18:06.246
to change his friend's grades.

1:18:06.420 --> 1:18:10.163
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

1:18:10.337 --> 1:18:12.688
How could that child
pass her classes?

1:18:14.341 --> 1:18:17.388
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

1:18:17.562 --> 1:18:19.520
What did you do to help her?

1:19:43.735 --> 1:19:46.607
-Your father...
-Mom, Mom, don't.

1:19:48.218 --> 1:19:50.960
-He got held up at the lab.
-

1:19:51.134 --> 1:19:54.137
Okay. He always does.

1:19:56.748 --> 1:19:58.141
He wanted to be here.

1:19:58.315 --> 1:20:00.230
You always say that.

1:20:00.404 --> 1:20:02.145
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

1:20:02.319 --> 1:20:05.017
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

1:20:05.191 --> 1:20:08.716
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...

1:20:08.891 --> 1:20:11.110
I know he's proud of you.

1:20:11.284 --> 1:20:13.721
We both are, Victor.

1:20:13.896 --> 1:20:17.116
Hey, hey, hey.

1:20:17.290 --> 1:20:20.337
With everything I know
you can do today,

1:20:20.511 --> 1:20:23.166
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

1:20:23.340 --> 1:20:24.384
-

1:20:28.606 --> 1:20:30.216
Dr. Stone,
I'm sorry,

1:20:31.391 --> 1:20:33.132
your wife didn't survive.

1:20:34.873 --> 1:20:36.875
I'm afraid
your son won't either.

1:20:51.150 --> 1:20:52.717
I won't let you die.

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:57.243
I won't allow it.

1:21:03.597 --> 1:21:05.295
I won't allow it.

1:21:08.776 --> 1:21:09.777
Victor.

1:21:11.170 --> 1:21:14.608
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.

1:21:14.782 --> 1:21:18.047
You still have a life
ahead of you.

1:21:18.221 --> 1:21:21.441
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

1:21:24.096 --> 1:21:25.619
If you were there,

1:21:27.012 --> 1:21:28.884
Mom would still be alive.

1:21:31.712 --> 1:21:33.540
All right, look,

1:21:35.064 --> 1:21:37.370
you don't have to give me
a second chance,

1:21:37.544 --> 1:21:39.024
but give yourself one.

1:21:41.157 --> 1:21:44.116
If you can't stand
looking at me,

1:21:45.857 --> 1:21:47.467
try listening.

1:22:16.279 --> 1:22:18.934
What you can do now, Victor.

1:22:19.108 --> 1:22:22.633
Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.

1:22:22.807 --> 1:22:25.288
The tip of the tip.

1:22:37.778 --> 1:22:40.129
-

1:22:55.448 --> 1:22:57.450
In the world
of ones and zeroes,

1:22:57.624 --> 1:23:00.279
you are the absolute master.

1:23:00.453 --> 1:23:03.021
No firewall can stop you.

1:23:03.195 --> 1:23:05.502
No encryption can defy you.

1:23:05.676 --> 1:23:08.461
We're all at your mercy, Vic.

1:23:08.635 --> 1:23:10.986
From our power grids
to our telecommunications,

1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:13.205
everyone's lives
are controlled

1:23:13.379 --> 1:23:16.339
and dominated
by complex digital networks

1:23:16.513 --> 1:23:20.517
that will bend
without effort to your will.

1:23:30.918 --> 1:23:32.442
The fate of the world

1:23:32.616 --> 1:23:35.358
will literally
rest in your hands.

1:23:43.192 --> 1:23:45.281
Its entire nuclear arsenal,

1:23:45.455 --> 1:23:48.197
you could launch
with a thought.

1:23:57.380 --> 1:23:58.903
-

1:23:59.077 --> 1:24:00.470
The world's monetary systems

1:24:00.644 --> 1:24:02.254
and its complex interactions

1:24:02.428 --> 1:24:05.083
will seem as easy
to manipulate for you

1:24:05.257 --> 1:24:06.824
as a child's plaything.

1:24:40.901 --> 1:24:45.341
The question...
No, the challenge

1:24:45.515 --> 1:24:48.692
won't be doing it.

1:24:48.866 --> 1:24:50.694
It will be not doing.

1:24:50.868 --> 1:24:52.870
Not seeing.

1:24:54.959 --> 1:24:57.266
It is the burden
of this responsibility

1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:00.660
that will define you
and who you choose to be.

1:25:32.301 --> 1:25:33.302
Now, make a wish.

1:25:34.651 --> 1:25:36.479
One more time.

1:25:36.653 --> 1:25:39.003
Good job. Wave to Grandma!

1:25:39.177 --> 1:25:40.309
Hi, Grandma!

1:26:40.586 --> 1:26:41.631
What?

1:26:43.763 --> 1:26:45.330
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1:26:46.636 --> 1:26:47.985
Oh, my God.

1:26:48.159 --> 1:26:49.856
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1:26:55.253 --> 1:26:58.125
Victor...

1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:02.652
Victor, these are the words  and deductions of a scientist.

1:27:02.826 --> 1:27:04.958
That's how I've been
speaking to you.

1:27:05.698 --> 1:27:08.962
Now,

1:27:09.136 --> 1:27:13.097
let me
speak to you from my heart,
not as a scientist,

1:27:13.271 --> 1:27:14.446
as a father.

1:27:28.852 --> 1:27:29.940
Hey.

1:27:31.202 --> 1:27:32.943
Hey, you!

1:27:48.785 --> 1:27:52.092
Because you are
holding yourself back.

1:27:52.267 --> 1:27:55.313
You're going in circles, man.

1:27:55.487 --> 1:27:57.620
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,

1:27:57.794 --> 1:27:58.969
going on four.

1:27:59.143 --> 1:28:00.405
Where do you
even find the time?

1:28:00.579 --> 1:28:01.798
I make the time.

1:28:01.972 --> 1:28:03.365
-I just need one more gig...
-Barry.

1:28:03.539 --> 1:28:04.191
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

1:28:04.366 --> 1:28:05.497
You can't.

1:28:05.671 --> 1:28:06.846
Like I always said
I would.

1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:08.544
You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.

1:28:08.718 --> 1:28:10.197
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

1:28:10.372 --> 1:28:11.547
-Please, we have 10 minutes.
-And this is all to pay

1:28:11.721 --> 1:28:12.635
for a criminal justice degree,
huh?

1:28:12.809 --> 1:28:13.766
Yeah.

1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:15.290
For what?

1:28:15.464 --> 1:28:18.336
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

1:28:18.510 --> 1:28:19.990
who's still in prison
for the murder

1:28:20.164 --> 1:28:21.731
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.

1:28:21.905 --> 1:28:23.428
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

1:28:23.602 --> 1:28:25.125
I can't remember.

1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:26.562
Oh, boy.

1:28:26.736 --> 1:28:28.912
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.

1:28:29.956 --> 1:28:31.001
Give me your hand, man.

1:28:36.702 --> 1:28:39.879
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

1:28:40.053 --> 1:28:43.492
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

1:28:49.541 --> 1:28:51.326
I want you
to give all that up.

1:28:54.416 --> 1:28:57.332
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

1:28:59.812 --> 1:29:02.772
I am a drag on your life.

1:29:08.212 --> 1:29:10.127
Okay. Um...

1:29:10.301 --> 1:29:13.652
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

1:29:13.826 --> 1:29:15.088
Please.

1:29:15.262 --> 1:29:16.612
Hey, you know what
criminal justice

1:29:16.786 --> 1:29:18.353
would be for me?

1:29:18.527 --> 1:29:23.270
My son not wasting his life.

1:29:24.750 --> 1:29:26.404
You can be
whatever you wanna be.

1:29:26.578 --> 1:29:27.884
You're brilliant, man.

1:29:30.452 --> 1:29:33.237
Absolute best of the best.

1:29:35.195 --> 1:29:39.809
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

1:29:39.983 --> 1:29:41.724
for some old dude

1:29:41.898 --> 1:29:45.075
who's not going anywhere.

1:29:45.249 --> 1:29:46.555
-Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

1:29:46.729 --> 1:29:47.991
That's not true.

1:29:48.165 --> 1:29:49.427
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

1:29:49.601 --> 1:29:51.255
I want you
to make your own future.

1:29:51.429 --> 1:29:53.083
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

1:29:53.257 --> 1:29:54.650
Open gate.

1:29:54.824 --> 1:29:56.086
Great.

1:30:00.090 --> 1:30:02.179
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

1:30:02.353 --> 1:30:03.789
Clear.
Close the gate.

1:30:56.538 --> 1:30:59.889
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

1:31:00.063 --> 1:31:01.673
You said that like it explains

1:31:01.847 --> 1:31:04.023
why there's a total stranger
in my place

1:31:04.197 --> 1:31:06.983
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

1:31:09.072 --> 1:31:10.813
Tell me about this.

1:31:14.991 --> 1:31:17.689
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

1:31:17.863 --> 1:31:20.518
but who is definitely not me.

1:31:21.693 --> 1:31:23.565
Somebody... I don't know.

1:31:23.739 --> 1:31:25.567
Hippie, long hair.

1:31:25.741 --> 1:31:28.483
Very attractive Jewish boy.

1:31:30.049 --> 1:31:32.617
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

1:31:32.791 --> 1:31:34.358
I know you have abilities.

1:31:34.532 --> 1:31:36.578
I just don't know
what they are.

1:31:36.752 --> 1:31:37.753
My special skills

1:31:37.927 --> 1:31:40.712
include viola, web design,

1:31:40.886 --> 1:31:43.672
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

1:31:43.846 --> 1:31:47.414
Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.

1:31:47.589 --> 1:31:49.678
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

1:31:49.852 --> 1:31:51.723
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

1:31:51.897 --> 1:31:53.682
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

1:31:53.856 --> 1:31:55.466
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:58.034
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

1:31:59.514 --> 1:32:01.428
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

1:32:01.603 --> 1:32:03.561
but whoever
you're looking for,

1:32:03.735 --> 1:32:04.693
it's not me.

1:32:46.561 --> 1:32:48.388
You're the Batman?

1:32:48.563 --> 1:32:51.478
So, you're fast.

1:32:51.653 --> 1:32:53.176
That feels
like an oversimplification.

1:32:53.350 --> 1:32:55.091
I'm putting together a team.

1:32:55.265 --> 1:32:57.354
People with special abilities.

1:32:57.528 --> 1:32:59.008
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

1:32:59.182 --> 1:33:01.184
Stop right there. I'm in.

1:33:02.272 --> 1:33:03.578
You are?

1:33:03.752 --> 1:33:04.796
Just like that?

1:33:08.060 --> 1:33:10.454
I need friends.

1:33:10.628 --> 1:33:13.979
Great. Great.

1:33:14.153 --> 1:33:16.373
Can I keep this?

1:33:16.547 --> 1:33:18.288
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

1:33:18.462 --> 1:33:20.116
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

1:33:20.290 --> 1:33:21.813
I call it the Speed Force.

1:33:21.987 --> 1:33:23.510
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

1:33:23.685 --> 1:33:26.252
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

1:33:26.426 --> 1:33:29.038
I am a snack hole.

1:33:29.212 --> 1:33:31.997
How many people are
on this special fight team?

1:33:32.171 --> 1:33:34.086
-Three, including you.
-Three?

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:36.828
Against what?

1:33:37.002 --> 1:33:38.438
I'll tell you on the plane.

1:33:39.091 --> 1:33:40.789
Plane?

1:33:40.963 --> 1:33:42.704
What are your
superpowers again?

1:33:42.878 --> 1:33:44.575
I'm rich.

1:34:07.685 --> 1:34:09.513
Oh, Miss Prince,
let me do that.

1:34:09.687 --> 1:34:12.647
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

1:34:12.821 --> 1:34:14.300
Would you like
to have some?

1:34:14.474 --> 1:34:15.737
Uh, no, thank you.

1:34:17.173 --> 1:34:19.741
If you put the water in first.

1:34:19.915 --> 1:34:22.831
Of course.
-So we don't scald the tea.

1:34:25.790 --> 1:34:27.357
-Yes.
-Great.

1:34:27.531 --> 1:34:29.446
No, that's probably
enough tea.

1:34:29.620 --> 1:34:31.970
All right.

1:34:32.144 --> 1:34:33.668
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

1:34:33.842 --> 1:34:37.628
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

1:34:37.802 --> 1:34:40.718
I will.
I will, definitely will.

1:34:40.892 --> 1:34:43.112
Uh... What are you working on?

1:34:43.286 --> 1:34:45.027
It's a gauntlet

1:34:45.201 --> 1:34:48.944
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

1:34:49.118 --> 1:34:51.555
-Wow.
-Here, let me show you.

1:34:51.729 --> 1:34:54.601
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

1:34:56.299 --> 1:34:57.779
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

1:34:57.953 --> 1:34:59.128
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

1:34:59.302 --> 1:35:00.346
Of course.

1:35:05.525 --> 1:35:07.266
Ah.

1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:10.400
Ah, now,
let's see how that did.

1:35:10.574 --> 1:35:12.794
-Ha! Yes.

1:35:12.968 --> 1:35:14.621
Not to be sneezed at.

1:35:14.796 --> 1:35:17.189
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

1:35:17.363 --> 1:35:18.974
It's Master Wayne's idea.

1:35:19.148 --> 1:35:21.411
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

1:35:21.585 --> 1:35:24.153
-In black, of course.
-Oh.

1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:34.076
-All right. Victor Stone.
-

1:35:50.396 --> 1:35:52.659
Something is not working.

1:35:52.834 --> 1:35:54.444
Mmm.

1:36:04.236 --> 1:36:06.543
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

1:37:03.687 --> 1:37:06.733
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

1:37:06.908 --> 1:37:08.300
You know who I am.

1:37:08.474 --> 1:37:10.694
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

1:37:10.868 --> 1:37:13.915
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

1:37:14.089 --> 1:37:15.046
The world does.

1:37:16.482 --> 1:37:18.093
Fuck the world.

1:37:19.834 --> 1:37:22.097
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

1:37:23.446 --> 1:37:26.492
I can't begin to imagine what.

1:37:26.666 --> 1:37:30.105
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

1:37:30.279 --> 1:37:32.020
Gifts?

1:37:32.194 --> 1:37:34.326
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

1:37:34.500 --> 1:37:36.154
We need you, Victor.

1:37:36.328 --> 1:37:37.895
And maybe you need us.

1:37:38.069 --> 1:37:39.723
I don't need anyone.

1:37:41.943 --> 1:37:43.161
Not anymore.

1:37:43.335 --> 1:37:45.642
I told myself the same
for a long time.

1:37:52.518 --> 1:37:55.173
I lost someone I loved once.

1:37:58.089 --> 1:38:02.833
I shut myself off
from everyone.

1:38:04.530 --> 1:38:07.185
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

1:38:09.971 --> 1:38:13.365
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

1:38:13.539 --> 1:38:17.456
And if you asked to meet me...

1:38:17.630 --> 1:38:20.285
you're working on it, too.

1:39:32.096 --> 1:39:33.968
You were right
about the metal sample

1:39:34.142 --> 1:39:35.752
from the Superman ship.

1:39:35.926 --> 1:39:39.277
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

1:39:39.451 --> 1:39:40.887
look what happens.

1:39:49.896 --> 1:39:51.855
3.5 million kelvin.

1:39:52.029 --> 1:39:54.945
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

1:39:55.119 --> 1:39:57.426
Hot, dense matter.

1:40:00.777 --> 1:40:03.562
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

1:40:03.736 --> 1:40:05.825
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:07.479
She dumped me anyway.

1:40:07.653 --> 1:40:08.872
Yeah.

1:40:13.094 --> 1:40:14.269
Hey, Doc,

1:40:14.443 --> 1:40:16.097
do you think
Batman is connected

1:40:16.271 --> 1:40:18.664
to the object
the CID is looking for?

1:40:19.796 --> 1:40:22.886
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

1:40:24.061 --> 1:40:25.106
No...

1:40:26.150 --> 1:40:27.325
I don't.

1:41:02.186 --> 1:41:04.232
Oh, Victor.

1:41:17.854 --> 1:41:19.551
-

1:41:21.423 --> 1:41:23.294
All right! Let's go!

1:41:24.687 --> 1:41:25.775
Commissioner Gordon?

1:41:25.949 --> 1:41:27.037
Come on!

1:41:27.211 --> 1:41:28.386
Your messages.

1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:29.822
Hey, hey!

1:41:32.869 --> 1:41:35.480
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

1:41:35.654 --> 1:41:38.440
Half of Gotham's
reality-challenged
community showed up.

1:41:38.614 --> 1:41:40.790
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

1:41:40.964 --> 1:41:42.922
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

1:41:43.097 --> 1:41:44.663
What's wrong
with dental school?

1:41:47.797 --> 1:41:50.930
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

1:41:51.105 --> 1:41:54.020
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

1:41:54.195 --> 1:41:56.022
On a possibly related note,

1:41:56.197 --> 1:41:58.416
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

1:41:58.590 --> 1:42:00.244
at the lab across the harbor.

1:42:00.418 --> 1:42:03.552
-Looks like...
-I know what it looks like,
Crispus.

1:42:03.726 --> 1:42:06.163
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

1:42:06.337 --> 1:42:08.948
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

1:42:10.036 --> 1:42:11.081
I'll talk to him tonight.

1:42:11.255 --> 1:42:12.778
How, Jim?

1:42:12.952 --> 1:42:14.389
How do you think?

1:42:32.711 --> 1:42:34.017
Silas?

1:42:34.191 --> 1:42:35.366
Hey, hey.

1:42:35.540 --> 1:42:36.846
Hey, hey!

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:43.853
Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

1:42:44.027 --> 1:42:45.115
His name is Victor.

1:42:45.942 --> 1:42:48.684
We met, spoke.

1:42:49.685 --> 1:42:51.730
Give him time.

1:42:51.904 --> 1:42:53.863
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

1:42:54.037 --> 1:42:57.780
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

1:42:57.954 --> 1:43:00.043
So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

1:43:00.217 --> 1:43:01.610
Oh!

1:43:01.784 --> 1:43:04.439
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

1:43:04.613 --> 1:43:06.702
Oh, sorry.
That's your signal.

1:43:06.876 --> 1:43:08.573
That means we have to go now.

1:43:08.747 --> 1:43:12.011
-Yeah, that's what that means.
-It's so cool.

1:44:09.373 --> 1:44:11.070
Commander Mera,
I told the king

1:44:11.245 --> 1:44:12.898
the perimeter guards
were taken.

1:44:13.072 --> 1:44:14.770
He won't send reinforcements.

1:44:14.944 --> 1:44:17.425
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

1:44:17.599 --> 1:44:21.820
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

1:44:21.994 --> 1:44:23.561
All right, take what men
we have left

1:44:23.735 --> 1:44:25.389
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

1:45:29.888 --> 1:45:31.629
-

1:46:05.315 --> 1:46:07.317
You can't escape.

1:46:08.144 --> 1:46:10.059
I'm not trying to.

1:48:12.703 --> 1:48:14.879
Vulko told me
you would come.

1:48:15.053 --> 1:48:17.665
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

1:48:20.363 --> 1:48:21.582
Wait.

1:48:23.671 --> 1:48:24.672
Please.

1:48:28.327 --> 1:48:29.633
I knew her.

1:48:31.983 --> 1:48:34.290
Well, that makes one of us.

1:48:34.464 --> 1:48:35.987
My parents died in the wars.

1:48:37.946 --> 1:48:39.338
She took me in.

1:48:39.513 --> 1:48:41.340
What a saint.

1:48:41.515 --> 1:48:43.647
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

1:48:43.821 --> 1:48:46.432
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

1:48:46.607 --> 1:48:48.173
and never gave me
another thought.

1:48:48.347 --> 1:48:51.525
Your mother left you
to save your life.

1:48:51.699 --> 1:48:54.092
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

1:48:55.703 --> 1:48:57.661
What it cost her.

1:48:59.010 --> 1:49:01.143
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

1:49:03.624 --> 1:49:05.190
It would have been
her responsibility

1:49:05.364 --> 1:49:08.454
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

1:49:09.064 --> 1:49:10.152
Now,

1:49:11.457 --> 1:49:12.763
it's yours.

1:50:17.132 --> 1:50:18.568
Yes.

1:50:41.591 --> 1:50:42.940
Steppenwolf,

1:50:43.114 --> 1:50:45.029
tell me what you've learned.

1:50:45.203 --> 1:50:47.858
Two boxes
found and awake.

1:50:48.032 --> 1:50:50.992
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

1:50:51.166 --> 1:50:54.125
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

1:50:54.299 --> 1:50:56.737
Where is the third Mother Box?

1:50:56.911 --> 1:50:59.304
The parademons
sense its presence

1:50:59.478 --> 1:51:01.002
and search for the third.

1:51:01.176 --> 1:51:02.177
They have taken prisoners

1:51:02.351 --> 1:51:04.396
who carry its scent.

1:51:05.180 --> 1:51:06.877
Go.

1:51:07.051 --> 1:51:08.923
Interrogate the prisoners.

1:51:09.750 --> 1:51:11.621
Find the third.

1:51:13.188 --> 1:51:15.320
They will tell me
what they know,

1:51:16.626 --> 1:51:19.063
or I will rip it from them.

1:52:02.454 --> 1:52:03.934
How many of you are there?

1:52:04.848 --> 1:52:05.936
Not enough.

1:52:08.112 --> 1:52:10.332
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

1:52:10.506 --> 1:52:11.681
Description
matches the suspect

1:52:11.855 --> 1:52:13.596
in the Metropolis abductions.

1:52:13.770 --> 1:52:14.728
Parademons.

1:52:15.424 --> 1:52:17.121
Okay.

1:52:17.295 --> 1:52:19.297
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

1:52:19.471 --> 1:52:21.082
At the lab.

1:52:21.256 --> 1:52:22.953
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

1:52:23.127 --> 1:52:24.172
So the eight
may still be alive.

1:52:24.346 --> 1:52:25.260
Nine.

1:52:25.434 --> 1:52:27.218
Oh.

1:52:27.392 --> 1:52:29.830
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

1:52:35.096 --> 1:52:37.620
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

1:52:37.794 --> 1:52:39.100
So, how do we find him?

1:52:39.274 --> 1:52:40.971
There must be a nest nearby.

1:52:41.145 --> 1:52:45.193
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

1:52:45.367 --> 1:52:47.499
No discernable pattern
I can see.

1:52:47.673 --> 1:52:48.936
The lines on the map
don't converge.

1:52:49.110 --> 1:52:50.502
On land.

1:52:50.676 --> 1:52:51.939
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

1:52:52.113 --> 1:52:53.201
between the two cities.

1:52:53.375 --> 1:52:54.550
These are air vents.

1:52:54.724 --> 1:52:56.204
They all lead
down to the tunnel

1:52:56.378 --> 1:52:58.336
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

1:52:58.510 --> 1:53:00.730
The nest could be there.

1:53:00.904 --> 1:53:02.819
Uh,
is he coming with us now,

1:53:02.993 --> 1:53:04.647
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

1:53:04.821 --> 1:53:06.170
I have something bigger.

1:53:07.606 --> 1:53:10.392
Do you really think that...

1:53:10.566 --> 1:53:14.004
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

1:53:14.178 --> 1:53:16.615
Oh. That's rude.

1:53:55.350 --> 1:53:57.439
We're close.

1:53:57.613 --> 1:53:59.571
The scent of the enemy.

1:54:00.355 --> 1:54:01.399
Of absence.

1:54:02.052 --> 1:54:03.532
Darkness.

1:54:04.315 --> 1:54:05.577
Death.

1:54:05.751 --> 1:54:07.144
Where are we, Alfred?

1:54:07.318 --> 1:54:08.189
Stryker's Island.

1:54:08.363 --> 1:54:10.321
You should be directly under

1:54:10.495 --> 1:54:13.107
the venting tower
for the tunnel.

1:54:13.281 --> 1:54:14.760
Now look to your left,

1:54:14.935 --> 1:54:16.762
you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.

1:54:16.937 --> 1:54:19.374
Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.

1:54:19.548 --> 1:54:20.723
That's it.

1:54:20.897 --> 1:54:22.290
Let's go.

1:54:36.391 --> 1:54:38.784
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

1:54:40.395 --> 1:54:41.700
Either of you?

1:54:41.875 --> 1:54:42.919
Don't engage alone.

1:54:43.789 --> 1:54:44.965
We do this together.

1:54:54.017 --> 1:54:55.845
I heard about you.

1:54:57.673 --> 1:54:59.109
Didn't think you were real.

1:54:59.283 --> 1:55:00.763
I'm real when it's useful.

1:55:11.121 --> 1:55:12.862
I grow tired of your silence.

1:55:13.036 --> 1:55:15.125
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

1:55:22.002 --> 1:55:24.221
Please. We have families.

1:55:24.395 --> 1:55:26.441
Then you have weakness.

1:55:26.615 --> 1:55:28.138
Steppenwolf.

1:55:28.312 --> 1:55:32.447
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

1:55:32.621 --> 1:55:34.101
Good guess.

1:55:34.275 --> 1:55:37.669
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

1:55:37.843 --> 1:55:40.020
Circle to the other side.

1:55:40.194 --> 1:55:42.109
We'll surround them
and surprise him.

1:55:46.722 --> 1:55:48.593
You have been
near a Mother Box.

1:55:48.767 --> 1:55:50.465
The scent is on you.

1:55:50.639 --> 1:55:52.119
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:55:52.293 --> 1:55:54.077
-Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

1:55:54.251 --> 1:55:56.427
He... He doesn't know.

1:56:00.083 --> 1:56:01.780
Wait, please, please!

1:56:07.612 --> 1:56:10.398
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

1:56:10.572 --> 1:56:12.661
I will die before I tell you.

1:56:12.835 --> 1:56:14.924
You'll die if you don't.

1:56:15.098 --> 1:56:16.056
No!

1:56:25.456 --> 1:56:26.501
Victor.

1:56:26.675 --> 1:56:27.850
Kill them both.

1:56:31.506 --> 1:56:33.812
Ah, Amazon.

1:56:33.987 --> 1:56:36.467
But not like your sisters.

1:56:36.641 --> 1:56:37.860
Stronger.

1:57:13.548 --> 1:57:15.115
Hold!

1:57:15.289 --> 1:57:17.421
This one will be mine.

1:57:19.467 --> 1:57:21.860
I belong to no one.

1:57:35.918 --> 1:57:37.876
Guys, this is not together.

1:57:44.970 --> 1:57:46.494
Help get those people
out of here.

1:57:46.668 --> 1:57:48.278
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

1:57:58.375 --> 1:57:59.768
Everybody, move!

1:58:08.559 --> 1:58:10.039
A little quicker.

1:58:12.433 --> 1:58:13.825
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

1:58:13.999 --> 1:58:16.350
I've got this. Keep moving.

1:58:18.395 --> 1:58:19.309
This way.

1:58:55.780 --> 1:58:57.173
The energy
is dissipating.

1:58:57.347 --> 1:58:59.958
My gauntlet worked!

1:59:00.133 --> 1:59:02.396
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

1:59:02.570 --> 1:59:04.615
Thought you'd never ask.

1:59:04.789 --> 1:59:06.878
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

1:59:37.039 --> 1:59:38.040
Thank you, Alfred.

1:59:38.214 --> 1:59:39.520
Don't mention it.

2:00:02.325 --> 2:00:03.283
No!

2:00:06.982 --> 2:00:07.983
Whew.

2:00:11.378 --> 2:00:12.814
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.

2:00:12.988 --> 2:00:16.121
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

2:00:27.829 --> 2:00:29.178
My turn.

2:01:51.652 --> 2:01:53.131
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

2:01:53.306 --> 2:01:55.699
Are you all right,
Master Wayne?

2:01:55.873 --> 2:01:56.831
Are you all right?

2:02:07.624 --> 2:02:11.019
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

2:02:25.381 --> 2:02:26.339
You okay?

2:02:26.948 --> 2:02:28.210
Mm.

2:02:28.384 --> 2:02:29.994
Wasn't sure you'd come.

2:02:31.082 --> 2:02:32.345
You're my father.

2:02:35.870 --> 2:02:36.827
Go.

2:02:50.493 --> 2:02:51.451
No!

2:03:37.018 --> 2:03:39.324
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

2:03:40.935 --> 2:03:42.676
Uh, do I know you?

2:04:13.663 --> 2:04:14.838
What are we under, right now?

2:04:15.665 --> 2:04:16.884
Gotham Harbor.

2:04:55.662 --> 2:04:56.880
Who is that?

2:05:22.297 --> 2:05:23.428
Come on.

2:05:28.564 --> 2:05:29.696
Diana, get on!

2:06:31.671 --> 2:06:33.150
What is it?

2:06:40.984 --> 2:06:42.377
Show me.

2:07:21.546 --> 2:07:23.157
It is here.

2:07:23.984 --> 2:07:26.856
On this world.

2:08:00.847 --> 2:08:02.196
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

2:08:02.370 --> 2:08:03.806
for possible alien microbes.

2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:05.634
U.S. government protocols
require that...

2:08:05.808 --> 2:08:08.550
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

2:08:13.120 --> 2:08:14.425
It called to him.

2:08:14.599 --> 2:08:16.166
The Mother Box.

2:08:16.340 --> 2:08:17.907
The one he already has.

2:08:18.081 --> 2:08:21.084
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

2:08:21.258 --> 2:08:23.565
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

2:08:23.739 --> 2:08:24.827
If he doesn't already have it.

2:08:28.570 --> 2:08:29.919
He doesn't have it.

2:08:33.183 --> 2:08:34.315
I do.

2:08:44.934 --> 2:08:46.980
Have you finished
the conquest?

2:08:47.154 --> 2:08:48.416
Not yet, DeSaad.

2:08:48.590 --> 2:08:50.810
Then why do you summon me?

2:08:50.984 --> 2:08:52.681
I bring news.

2:08:52.855 --> 2:08:55.771
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

2:08:55.945 --> 2:09:00.863
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

2:09:01.037 --> 2:09:03.213
The Anti-Life Equation.

2:09:03.387 --> 2:09:05.389
The key to
controlling all life

2:09:05.563 --> 2:09:08.088
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

2:09:08.262 --> 2:09:11.221
He found it hidden
on a primitive planet,
but before...

2:09:11.395 --> 2:09:14.268
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

2:09:14.442 --> 2:09:16.923
I have found
the primitive planet.

2:09:17.097 --> 2:09:19.142
The world that fought back.

2:09:19.316 --> 2:09:21.188
It is Earth.

2:09:21.362 --> 2:09:23.581
The Anti-Life Equation
is carved

2:09:23.756 --> 2:09:27.498
into the surface
of this very world.

2:09:31.285 --> 2:09:32.677
Are you certain?

2:09:32.852 --> 2:09:34.027
I have seen it.

2:09:34.201 --> 2:09:37.378
I have looked
with my own eyes.

2:09:39.336 --> 2:09:40.163
A-L.

2:10:20.813 --> 2:10:22.379
My lord.

2:10:23.946 --> 2:10:28.037
Oh, Steppenwolf.

2:10:28.211 --> 2:10:32.085
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

2:10:32.259 --> 2:10:35.088
Can it be true
that you have found it?

2:10:35.262 --> 2:10:38.004
I have, great one.

2:10:38.178 --> 2:10:41.137
The lost world is Earth.

2:10:41.311 --> 2:10:45.489
Anti-Life is here.

2:10:45.663 --> 2:10:49.015
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

2:10:49.189 --> 2:10:52.105
synchronize The Unity,
and when this world
is scorched,

2:10:52.279 --> 2:10:55.456
I will come
for my great prize.

2:10:56.457 --> 2:10:59.547
You will come to Earth?

2:10:59.721 --> 2:11:03.943
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

2:11:04.117 --> 2:11:05.640
looking for Anti-Life.

2:11:05.814 --> 2:11:08.991
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

2:11:09.165 --> 2:11:12.342
I will stride
across their bones

2:11:12.516 --> 2:11:14.910
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

2:11:15.084 --> 2:11:17.782
And all of existence

2:11:17.957 --> 2:11:21.351
shall be mine.

2:11:24.877 --> 2:11:28.750
It shall be so, my master.

2:11:32.972 --> 2:11:34.843
So cool.

2:11:35.017 --> 2:11:37.628
From the outside,
it looks like this building
was abandoned.

2:11:41.110 --> 2:11:42.851
It wants to fly.

2:11:44.070 --> 2:11:46.072
You talk to machines?

2:11:46.246 --> 2:11:48.248
I speak
to intelligence.

2:11:48.422 --> 2:11:49.597
This one's saying
she can't fly

2:11:49.771 --> 2:11:51.294
because of a software issue,

2:11:51.468 --> 2:11:53.340
but I could fix it
with a little time.

2:12:03.219 --> 2:12:05.569
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

2:12:05.743 --> 2:12:07.963
I could feel
the other two boxes.

2:12:08.137 --> 2:12:09.965
I know they're awake,

2:12:10.139 --> 2:12:11.793
but I can't see
where they are.

2:12:11.967 --> 2:12:13.795
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

2:12:13.969 --> 2:12:16.276
Even if we knew,

2:12:16.450 --> 2:12:19.192
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

2:12:21.455 --> 2:12:22.673
Maybe one.

2:12:22.847 --> 2:12:25.328
Hmm, Superman.

2:12:25.502 --> 2:12:27.069
As long as
the third box is asleep,

2:12:27.243 --> 2:12:29.550
they can't see it,
only sense it.

2:12:29.724 --> 2:12:31.769
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

2:12:31.944 --> 2:12:33.467
No. That's just a strategy

2:12:33.641 --> 2:12:35.556
to lose more slowly,
not to win.

2:12:35.730 --> 2:12:38.428
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

2:12:38.602 --> 2:12:39.734
Why don't we just destroy it?

2:12:39.908 --> 2:12:41.954
Fire doesn't
destroy the boxes.

2:12:42.128 --> 2:12:43.694
They're an unknown form
of matter.

2:12:43.868 --> 2:12:45.174
Oh, they love heat.

2:12:45.348 --> 2:12:47.481
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

2:12:47.655 --> 2:12:50.179
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

2:12:50.353 --> 2:12:51.615
Makes you think.

2:12:51.789 --> 2:12:54.270
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

2:12:54.444 --> 2:12:55.968
Are you trying
to say something?

2:12:56.142 --> 2:12:58.100
Oh, I'm saying it.

2:12:58.274 --> 2:13:00.015
How do we know you're not
working for them?

2:13:01.974 --> 2:13:03.932
It's a long story.

2:13:04.106 --> 2:13:05.978
You got somewhere else to be?

2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:14.987
The Nazis found the box

2:13:15.161 --> 2:13:17.250
at the end
of the Second World War,

2:13:17.424 --> 2:13:20.470
buried under
an Italian monastery.

2:13:20.644 --> 2:13:23.038
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

2:13:23.212 --> 2:13:25.823
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

2:13:25.998 --> 2:13:30.263
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

2:13:30.437 --> 2:13:32.178
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

2:13:32.352 --> 2:13:34.267
for 70 years

2:13:34.441 --> 2:13:37.574
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

2:13:39.185 --> 2:13:41.491
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

2:13:41.665 --> 2:13:42.623
between the ship...

2:13:43.928 --> 2:13:46.235
and 6-1-9-8-2.

2:13:46.409 --> 2:13:49.717
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

2:13:49.891 --> 2:13:51.849
Different civilizations,

2:13:52.024 --> 2:13:55.375
similar properties.

2:13:55.549 --> 2:13:58.769
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

2:13:58.943 --> 2:14:02.208
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

2:14:02.382 --> 2:14:04.079
And so did.

2:14:06.429 --> 2:14:07.387
Then...

2:14:09.606 --> 2:14:12.653
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

2:14:12.827 --> 2:14:16.048
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

2:14:16.222 --> 2:14:18.441
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

2:14:34.718 --> 2:14:36.807
He unleashed
an alien technology

2:14:36.981 --> 2:14:39.636
he didn't fully understand.

2:14:39.810 --> 2:14:42.117
He used that power
to keep me alive.

2:14:43.553 --> 2:14:45.207
-

2:14:45.729 --> 2:14:47.731
Alive...

2:14:47.905 --> 2:14:49.820
but turned into this.

2:14:52.649 --> 2:14:54.869
The box went back to sleep

2:14:55.870 --> 2:14:57.480
and he never returned it.

2:15:00.179 --> 2:15:02.137
That researcher
was Silas Stone.

2:15:03.878 --> 2:15:05.488
My father.

2:15:08.839 --> 2:15:10.580
Wait,

2:15:10.754 --> 2:15:14.106
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:16.456
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

2:15:16.630 --> 2:15:19.023
They're change machines.

2:15:19.198 --> 2:15:22.070
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

2:15:22.244 --> 2:15:24.377
alive or dead.

2:15:24.551 --> 2:15:26.770
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

2:15:26.944 --> 2:15:28.511
regenerate, reinstate.

2:15:28.685 --> 2:15:29.991
Reinstate?

2:15:30.165 --> 2:15:31.601
A box has the power

2:15:31.775 --> 2:15:33.690
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

2:15:33.864 --> 2:15:35.649
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

2:15:35.823 --> 2:15:36.954
can't be created or destroyed,

2:15:37.129 --> 2:15:39.131
their relations
just transform.

2:15:39.305 --> 2:15:42.046
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

2:15:42.221 --> 2:15:44.658
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

2:15:44.832 --> 2:15:48.836
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

2:15:50.925 --> 2:15:52.666
But a Mother Box...

2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:55.016
...turns smoke
back into a house.

2:16:01.065 --> 2:16:03.503
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

2:16:05.026 --> 2:16:07.463
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

2:16:34.795 --> 2:16:35.839
Who is it?

2:16:36.579 --> 2:16:37.711
Martha.

2:16:42.498 --> 2:16:43.717
Hi.

2:16:45.632 --> 2:16:46.981
Hi.

2:16:56.164 --> 2:16:57.600
I went to the Daily Planet

2:16:57.774 --> 2:17:01.125
to finally pick up
Clark's things.

2:17:02.649 --> 2:17:05.913
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

2:17:08.742 --> 2:17:10.309
I lost the farm.

2:17:12.006 --> 2:17:14.051
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

2:17:15.488 --> 2:17:16.967
Truth is, the house is too big

2:17:17.141 --> 2:17:19.796
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

2:17:19.970 --> 2:17:22.712
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

2:17:22.886 --> 2:17:24.801
for as long as you need.

2:17:26.063 --> 2:17:28.588
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

2:17:30.372 --> 2:17:32.418
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

2:17:32.592 --> 2:17:34.507
right by the diner.

2:17:34.681 --> 2:17:35.986
I'm not here for help.

2:17:37.205 --> 2:17:39.773
I'm here because

2:17:39.947 --> 2:17:42.297
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

2:17:43.820 --> 2:17:46.693
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

2:17:51.524 --> 2:17:53.134
I can't.

2:18:00.054 --> 2:18:02.622
The whole world is mourning.

2:18:04.014 --> 2:18:06.452
Grieving over a symbol.

2:18:06.626 --> 2:18:10.325
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

2:18:11.500 --> 2:18:13.502
I hear what people say.

2:18:13.676 --> 2:18:15.417
They talk like they knew him.

2:18:16.723 --> 2:18:18.942
But they didn't know Clark.

2:18:20.509 --> 2:18:22.903
And I can't stop them

2:18:23.077 --> 2:18:27.299
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

2:18:29.344 --> 2:18:31.825
You're the only one who knows.

2:18:31.999 --> 2:18:34.349
Who feels what I do.

2:18:35.742 --> 2:18:38.658
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

2:18:41.878 --> 2:18:45.186
I came all this way
because I wanted...

2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:47.319
because I wanted to see you.

2:18:48.581 --> 2:18:50.539
Tell you...

2:18:50.713 --> 2:18:52.498
I understand.

2:18:54.500 --> 2:18:56.719
I...

2:18:56.893 --> 2:19:00.332
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

2:19:04.161 --> 2:19:06.120
And I just miss him.

2:19:07.295 --> 2:19:09.819
I miss him so much.

2:19:16.217 --> 2:19:17.871
So do I, sweetheart.

2:19:22.745 --> 2:19:27.315
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

2:19:30.971 --> 2:19:33.495
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

2:19:35.976 --> 2:19:38.195
Come back to the living.

2:20:18.235 --> 2:20:21.021
The world
needs you, too, Lois.

2:20:24.851 --> 2:20:26.200
The dead are dead.

2:20:26.374 --> 2:20:28.115
The box brought Victor back.

2:20:28.289 --> 2:20:29.812
Victor wasn't dead.

2:20:29.986 --> 2:20:31.727
Life is either one or zero.

2:20:31.901 --> 2:20:34.817
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

2:20:34.991 --> 2:20:36.515
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

2:20:36.689 --> 2:20:38.255
Of course.

2:20:38.430 --> 2:20:40.562
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

2:20:40.736 --> 2:20:42.477
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

2:20:44.523 --> 2:20:46.002
- Okay, but...

2:20:46.176 --> 2:20:50.224
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

2:20:50.398 --> 2:20:51.791
What do we have to lose?

2:20:51.965 --> 2:20:54.228
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

2:20:54.402 --> 2:20:55.838
As soon as it wakes up...

2:20:56.012 --> 2:20:58.406
...the enemy sees it, comes,

2:20:58.580 --> 2:21:01.104
activates The Unity.
The end.

2:21:01.278 --> 2:21:03.672
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

2:21:03.846 --> 2:21:05.761
to a bunch
of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

2:21:05.935 --> 2:21:08.460
Even if Superman could return,

2:21:08.634 --> 2:21:10.462
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

2:21:10.636 --> 2:21:12.638
The Mother Box did.

2:21:12.812 --> 2:21:14.988
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

2:21:15.162 --> 2:21:17.991
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

2:21:18.165 --> 2:21:19.949
Didn't call out
to Steppenwolf.

2:21:20.123 --> 2:21:21.560
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

2:21:21.734 --> 2:21:23.823
Not until Superman died.

2:21:23.997 --> 2:21:26.434
Not until Superman died.

2:21:26.608 --> 2:21:28.480
It's like they were
afraid of him?

2:21:28.654 --> 2:21:31.439
Yes,
they were afraid of him.

2:21:34.398 --> 2:21:36.183
This is the only way.

2:21:37.924 --> 2:21:41.580
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

2:21:58.031 --> 2:21:59.989
Cross this one off
the bucket list.

2:22:00.163 --> 2:22:03.906
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

2:22:06.039 --> 2:22:08.389
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

2:22:09.129 --> 2:22:10.478
We could.

2:22:18.051 --> 2:22:19.618
He was my hero.

2:22:22.272 --> 2:22:23.491
All right.

2:22:27.147 --> 2:22:30.150
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

2:22:30.324 --> 2:22:31.543
Half-Atlantean.

2:22:33.501 --> 2:22:36.765
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

2:22:36.939 --> 2:22:40.856
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

2:22:41.030 --> 2:22:43.685
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

2:22:43.859 --> 2:22:45.861
Hate is useless.

2:22:49.038 --> 2:22:50.300
Yep.

2:22:51.650 --> 2:22:53.216
No, thank you.

2:22:57.786 --> 2:22:58.874
You know, my father told me

2:22:59.048 --> 2:23:00.702
there's a saying
in Atlantis...

2:23:02.530 --> 2:23:04.619
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

2:23:04.793 --> 2:23:06.099
"Not without..."

2:23:06.273 --> 2:23:07.579
"Not without
giving one up in return."

2:23:09.842 --> 2:23:11.365
We say the same thing.

2:23:14.063 --> 2:23:15.717
How about that?

2:23:15.891 --> 2:23:17.719
Wonder Woman.

2:23:19.155 --> 2:23:20.548
What do you think, man?

2:23:20.722 --> 2:23:23.333
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

2:23:23.507 --> 2:23:26.032
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

2:23:27.947 --> 2:23:29.731
Every guy's a younger guy.

2:23:31.777 --> 2:23:32.778
Jesus.

2:23:34.344 --> 2:23:36.042
Oh, Christ.

2:23:38.653 --> 2:23:41.003
-Oh, bloody...

2:23:42.396 --> 2:23:43.397
Any luck?

2:23:43.571 --> 2:23:44.964
If by "luck" you mean

2:23:45.138 --> 2:23:47.923
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

2:23:48.097 --> 2:23:50.056
then, no. No luck.

2:23:50.970 --> 2:23:52.536
It's okay.

2:23:52.711 --> 2:23:54.364
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

2:23:54.538 --> 2:23:55.801
to the Kryptonian ship.

2:23:55.975 --> 2:23:57.237
It's basically
an organic computer.

2:23:57.411 --> 2:23:58.978
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

2:23:59.152 --> 2:24:01.589
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

2:24:01.763 --> 2:24:03.199
Something like that.

2:24:03.373 --> 2:24:06.768
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

2:24:13.427 --> 2:24:14.907
Master Wayne...

2:24:17.039 --> 2:24:18.475
you did it!

2:24:18.650 --> 2:24:22.044
You put the team together
to fight this war.

2:24:22.218 --> 2:24:25.352
You've fulfilled your promise.

2:24:25.526 --> 2:24:29.399
But to try to do that...
I mean...

2:24:29.573 --> 2:24:32.446
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

2:24:32.620 --> 2:24:34.753
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

2:24:34.927 --> 2:24:37.973
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly
on faith,

2:24:38.147 --> 2:24:40.628
not on reason.

2:24:40.802 --> 2:24:45.024
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

2:24:45.198 --> 2:24:47.243
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

2:24:47.417 --> 2:24:50.377
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

2:24:50.551 --> 2:24:52.858
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

2:24:53.032 --> 2:24:54.729
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

2:24:54.903 --> 2:24:56.513
You do
when it's this red cape.

2:24:56.688 --> 2:24:58.777
This red cape charges back.

2:25:13.530 --> 2:25:14.706
Okay.

2:25:21.713 --> 2:25:24.063
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

2:25:24.237 --> 2:25:25.978
Everyone's clear,
including you.

2:25:26.152 --> 2:25:28.632
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

2:25:28.807 --> 2:25:30.330
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

2:25:30.504 --> 2:25:31.505
Absolutely.

2:25:35.552 --> 2:25:36.858
-Thanks.
-Listen up, everyone.

2:25:37.032 --> 2:25:39.469
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

2:25:39.643 --> 2:25:41.341
If you need
more medical attention...

2:25:41.515 --> 2:25:44.997
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

2:25:45.171 --> 2:25:46.389
-Definitely not "A."
-Okay.

2:25:46.563 --> 2:25:49.697
Or... "B"?

2:25:51.351 --> 2:25:52.569
Let me see "A" again?

2:25:58.227 --> 2:26:01.317
Right. We should get dressed.

2:26:03.493 --> 2:26:05.408
I'm always dressed.

2:26:32.566 --> 2:26:33.654
ID?

2:26:33.828 --> 2:26:34.960
ID.

2:26:38.180 --> 2:26:39.268
Aye, aye.

2:26:41.662 --> 2:26:42.794
"Aye, aye"?

2:27:06.078 --> 2:27:07.427
Okay.

2:27:07.601 --> 2:27:09.603
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

2:27:16.610 --> 2:27:17.741
Doc!

2:27:17.916 --> 2:27:19.221
They let you out
of quarantine.

2:27:19.395 --> 2:27:20.962
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

2:27:21.136 --> 2:27:22.921
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

2:27:23.095 --> 2:27:24.487
with the electron-laser.

2:27:24.661 --> 2:27:26.576
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

2:27:41.765 --> 2:27:44.377
Victor, clear this place out.

2:27:44.551 --> 2:27:46.031
Done.

2:27:50.078 --> 2:27:52.646
Code Red.
Contamination breach.

2:27:52.820 --> 2:27:56.084
All personnel
evacuate immediately.

2:27:56.258 --> 2:27:58.347
- Bio red five.

2:27:58.521 --> 2:28:00.915
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

2:28:01.089 --> 2:28:03.700
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

2:28:03.875 --> 2:28:05.180
It's gotta be a false alarm.

2:28:05.354 --> 2:28:07.356
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

2:28:07.530 --> 2:28:08.880
-Ryan, we just had it swept.
-We have to go, Doc.

2:28:09.054 --> 2:28:10.185
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

2:28:10.359 --> 2:28:11.795
-Let's go, Doc.
-Think about it.

2:28:11.970 --> 2:28:12.666
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:15.147
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

2:28:15.321 --> 2:28:17.932
Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.

2:28:24.504 --> 2:28:26.201
Attention, all personnel.

2:28:26.375 --> 2:28:29.161
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

2:28:29.335 --> 2:28:30.945
Move! Come on! Go, go!

2:28:31.119 --> 2:28:32.599
Everybody out! Go!

2:28:53.098 --> 2:28:55.883
-Yes! Gotcha!

2:28:56.057 --> 2:28:58.712
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

2:28:58.886 --> 2:29:01.367
Go ahead, Dr. Stone.
-This is a false alarm.

2:29:01.541 --> 2:29:03.935
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...

2:29:13.988 --> 2:29:15.337
Victor.

2:29:17.209 --> 2:29:19.298
Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.

2:29:20.386 --> 2:29:21.387
I was mistaken.

2:29:21.561 --> 2:29:22.779
The alarm's legit.

2:29:22.954 --> 2:29:24.520
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

2:29:24.694 --> 2:29:27.436
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

2:29:27.610 --> 2:29:28.785
Roger that, sir.

2:29:39.144 --> 2:29:40.710
Get the civilians out!

2:29:40.884 --> 2:29:41.842
Let's go! Let's go!

2:29:46.281 --> 2:29:47.500
-Everybody got out okay?
-I think so.

2:29:47.674 --> 2:29:48.631
-Everybody?
-Yes.

2:30:21.969 --> 2:30:23.188
This way.

2:30:33.850 --> 2:30:36.810
It knows he's here.

2:30:36.984 --> 2:30:38.899
Ooh, that's intense.

2:30:43.425 --> 2:30:45.253
This is amazing.

2:30:46.124 --> 2:30:47.342
This is crazy.

2:30:47.516 --> 2:30:49.388
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

2:30:49.562 --> 2:30:51.912
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

2:33:17.927 --> 2:33:19.712
Systems coming online.

2:33:22.671 --> 2:33:24.978
Welcome, Victor.

2:33:25.152 --> 2:33:26.719
Would you like
to assume command?

2:33:26.893 --> 2:33:27.894
I'm in.

2:33:37.382 --> 2:33:39.558
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

2:33:39.732 --> 2:33:41.429
I can override
the security protocols,

2:33:41.603 --> 2:33:43.214
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

2:33:43.388 --> 2:33:44.563
that Luthor's
power surges caused

2:33:44.737 --> 2:33:45.607
to the primary capacitors.

2:33:45.781 --> 2:33:47.218
English.

2:33:47.392 --> 2:33:49.568
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

2:33:49.742 --> 2:33:51.526
I might be able to do it.

2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:55.835
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

2:33:56.009 --> 2:33:57.358
I don't like
to break this rule,

2:33:57.532 --> 2:33:59.142
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

2:33:59.317 --> 2:34:00.840
Look, crazy things
happen to time,

2:34:01.014 --> 2:34:03.582
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

2:34:03.756 --> 2:34:05.497
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

2:34:05.671 --> 2:34:07.803
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

2:34:07.977 --> 2:34:10.545
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...

2:34:10.719 --> 2:34:12.286
still what we want?

2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:13.809
It is. Do it.

2:34:18.727 --> 2:34:19.815
Hey, Miss Lane.

2:34:19.989 --> 2:34:21.077
Morning.

2:34:21.252 --> 2:34:22.296
I didn't think
you were coming.

2:34:23.471 --> 2:34:24.951
One last time.

2:34:42.185 --> 2:34:45.841
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

2:34:46.015 --> 2:34:46.929
I'm in position.

2:34:49.976 --> 2:34:52.326
Ready to initiate
drop sequence.

2:34:52.500 --> 2:34:54.067
The Mother Box is ready.

2:35:13.608 --> 2:35:15.436
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

2:35:15.610 --> 2:35:17.525
This action
is irreversible.

2:35:17.699 --> 2:35:18.831
It's afraid.
It knows Steppenwolf
will come for it.

2:35:19.005 --> 2:35:20.833
We know that already.
Continue.

2:35:21.007 --> 2:35:23.444
I strongly advise
against activation.

2:35:23.618 --> 2:35:25.141
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.

2:35:25.316 --> 2:35:26.882
This action
is irreversible.

2:35:27.056 --> 2:35:28.319
-Five...
- Five...

2:35:28.493 --> 2:35:29.711
-Five...
-Apokoliptian technology

2:35:29.885 --> 2:35:30.930
-is hostile.
-This is a bad idea.

2:35:31.104 --> 2:35:31.496
No, it isn't.
Keep going.

2:35:31.670 --> 2:35:32.714
Four...

2:35:32.888 --> 2:35:34.586
Four...
-Four...

2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:35.891
I strongly advise
against activation.

2:35:36.065 --> 2:35:37.415
-We need to abort, now.
-Just do it.

2:35:37.589 --> 2:35:38.329
Three...
- Three...

2:35:38.503 --> 2:35:39.504
Three...

2:35:39.678 --> 2:35:41.549
-Two...
- Two...

2:35:41.723 --> 2:35:43.290
-Two...
-This course is irreversible.

2:35:43.464 --> 2:35:44.596
-One.
- One.

2:35:45.727 --> 2:35:47.207
One.

2:35:47.381 --> 2:35:48.426
This action
is irreversible.

2:37:17.776 --> 2:37:18.951
Victor?
-No.

2:37:19.908 --> 2:37:20.866
Go?

2:38:51.870 --> 2:38:54.481
The future  has taken root in the present.

2:38:54.655 --> 2:38:56.178
-Get down!

2:40:40.326 --> 2:40:41.849
He's back.

2:41:07.309 --> 2:41:08.789
-

2:41:08.963 --> 2:41:11.574
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

2:41:13.751 --> 2:41:15.100
What?

2:41:30.202 --> 2:41:31.159
Victor?

2:41:32.465 --> 2:41:33.466
Victor?

2:41:35.816 --> 2:41:37.600
-Shit.
-What are you doing?

2:41:37.775 --> 2:41:39.341
It's my auto-defense system.

2:41:39.515 --> 2:41:40.516
It senses danger.

2:41:40.691 --> 2:41:42.040
Victor, no! Victor!

2:41:42.214 --> 2:41:43.824
-I can't control it.
- Don't!

2:41:56.315 --> 2:41:57.446
Kal-El, no!

2:42:05.890 --> 2:42:07.718
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

2:42:14.986 --> 2:42:17.597
Arthur,
we need to restrain him.

2:42:48.193 --> 2:42:51.762
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...

2:42:52.893 --> 2:42:55.026
remember who you are.

2:42:56.723 --> 2:42:58.029
Tell me who you...

2:42:58.203 --> 2:42:59.770
-

2:44:43.221 --> 2:44:44.787
You should probably move.

2:44:48.139 --> 2:44:49.314
-You all right?
-Yeah.

2:44:49.488 --> 2:44:52.186
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

2:45:44.195 --> 2:45:46.153
Please don't make me do this.

2:45:56.076 --> 2:45:58.165
-

2:46:00.733 --> 2:46:02.517
-

2:46:18.925 --> 2:46:20.013
Clark.

2:46:21.145 --> 2:46:22.276
Clark, no.

2:46:33.853 --> 2:46:35.115
Clark.

2:46:35.289 --> 2:46:37.117
No.

2:46:37.291 --> 2:46:38.989
This world needs you.

2:46:44.255 --> 2:46:45.430
Clark.

2:46:45.604 --> 2:46:46.909
Clark.

2:46:47.084 --> 2:46:48.868
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

2:46:50.609 --> 2:46:51.653
Clark.

2:46:55.092 --> 2:46:56.441
Please.

2:47:30.692 --> 2:47:31.824
Please.

2:47:43.053 --> 2:47:44.141
Please.

2:47:44.967 --> 2:47:47.057
Just go.

2:47:47.231 --> 2:47:48.188
Yeah.

2:47:49.102 --> 2:47:50.364
Let's go.

2:48:22.962 --> 2:48:25.182
I'm so sorry.

2:48:34.539 --> 2:48:35.583
Take cover!

2:48:35.757 --> 2:48:38.108
-He's coming.
-The Mother Box.

2:48:38.282 --> 2:48:39.283
Where is it?

2:48:49.945 --> 2:48:51.121
Come on.

2:48:52.122 --> 2:48:54.124
Come on.

2:48:54.298 --> 2:48:56.126
-

2:49:12.664 --> 2:49:14.144
-

2:49:19.018 --> 2:49:22.456
Attention,
security breach detected.

2:49:22.630 --> 2:49:24.806
Sector Four, Level Three.

2:49:24.980 --> 2:49:27.722
Implement lockdown
procedures immediately.

2:49:56.316 --> 2:49:57.839
Give me the Mother Box.

2:50:11.070 --> 2:50:12.463
No, no, no.

2:50:15.030 --> 2:50:16.728
Dad, wait! Don't!

2:50:34.659 --> 2:50:37.488
-

2:50:57.072 --> 2:50:59.945
So begins the end.

2:51:05.733 --> 2:51:06.995
Victor?

2:51:09.607 --> 2:51:12.653
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

2:51:18.703 --> 2:51:19.834
Victor?

2:51:20.966 --> 2:51:22.446
He's dead.

2:51:22.620 --> 2:51:23.577
What?

2:51:24.709 --> 2:51:25.884
My father.

2:51:27.364 --> 2:51:30.976
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

2:51:31.150 --> 2:51:32.369
Oh, my God.

2:51:39.376 --> 2:51:41.465
His father's dead
'cause of us.

2:51:41.639 --> 2:51:43.031
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

2:51:43.205 --> 2:51:44.816
It wasn't a bad idea.

2:51:44.990 --> 2:51:47.340
We needed Superman.
We still do.

2:51:47.514 --> 2:51:49.777
Well, whatever returned,
it isn't Superman.

2:51:49.951 --> 2:51:52.954
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

2:51:53.128 --> 2:51:54.739
It is him.

2:51:54.913 --> 2:51:57.263
He recognized Lois Lane.

2:51:57.437 --> 2:51:59.526
-Who?
-The woman he loves.

2:51:59.700 --> 2:52:02.094
-He remembers her.
- Nah.

2:52:02.268 --> 2:52:04.009
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

2:52:04.183 --> 2:52:05.532
It's called instinct, Diana.

2:52:13.018 --> 2:52:14.846
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

2:52:15.020 --> 2:52:16.500
He's gone back to his base

2:52:16.674 --> 2:52:18.371
to assemble the three boxes.

2:52:18.545 --> 2:52:19.894
And we don't know
where his base is.

2:52:20.068 --> 2:52:21.592
-Or how long until...
- Hours.

2:52:21.766 --> 2:52:23.463
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

2:52:23.637 --> 2:52:26.597
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

2:52:26.771 --> 2:52:28.773
This is not your...

2:52:30.949 --> 2:52:32.603
He knew.

2:52:32.777 --> 2:52:34.387
He knew, he knew, he knew.

2:52:34.561 --> 2:52:36.215
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

2:52:36.389 --> 2:52:38.304
he was trying to superheat it.

2:52:38.478 --> 2:52:39.740
He made the core
the hottest thing

2:52:39.914 --> 2:52:41.133
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

2:52:41.307 --> 2:52:42.308
Now, anything that hot
would have to...

2:52:42.482 --> 2:52:43.353
Blink off the charts

2:52:43.527 --> 2:52:45.746
on a thermal imaging system.

2:52:45.920 --> 2:52:49.271
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

2:52:49.446 --> 2:52:51.317
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

2:52:51.491 --> 2:52:53.450
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

2:52:53.624 --> 2:52:55.060
I'm already on it.

2:52:55.234 --> 2:52:56.888
You have a satellite?

2:52:57.062 --> 2:52:58.411
I have six.

2:52:58.585 --> 2:52:59.586
Right.

2:53:01.458 --> 2:53:03.373
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

2:53:28.006 --> 2:53:30.051
You brought us here.

2:53:30.225 --> 2:53:31.401
You remembered.

2:53:32.314 --> 2:53:33.925
This is home.

2:53:35.883 --> 2:53:37.058
You spoke.

2:53:41.149 --> 2:53:42.977
Did I not before?

2:54:17.011 --> 2:54:19.492
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

2:54:21.059 --> 2:54:23.017
She never told anyone.

2:54:24.715 --> 2:54:26.456
I don't understand.

2:54:29.546 --> 2:54:31.939
She's a proud woman, Clark.

2:54:35.073 --> 2:54:36.466
Here.

2:54:51.393 --> 2:54:53.047
She loved it here.

2:55:03.884 --> 2:55:05.495
So did I.

2:55:07.497 --> 2:55:08.889
So did I.

2:55:34.567 --> 2:55:35.873
Wow!

2:55:36.047 --> 2:55:37.657
This is awesome.

2:55:37.831 --> 2:55:39.311
Brought some friends.

2:55:45.883 --> 2:55:48.494
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

2:55:48.668 --> 2:55:51.149
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

2:55:51.323 --> 2:55:53.499
-Alfred.
-Good day, ma'am.

2:55:54.805 --> 2:55:56.981
Oh...

2:55:59.984 --> 2:56:01.812
It's badass, Alfred.

2:56:04.641 --> 2:56:07.034
Well, I'll put on the tea.

2:56:07.208 --> 2:56:08.688
Great.

2:56:08.862 --> 2:56:10.211
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

2:56:13.171 --> 2:56:16.000
There's the
Mother Box, right there.

2:56:16.174 --> 2:56:17.915
Go to visible spectrum.

2:56:20.004 --> 2:56:22.093
Pozharnov.

2:56:22.267 --> 2:56:25.096
Ghost city
not far from Moscow.

2:56:25.270 --> 2:56:26.619
It's been abandoned since

2:56:26.793 --> 2:56:27.925
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

2:56:28.099 --> 2:56:29.491
Not even the army goes in.

2:56:29.666 --> 2:56:31.058
Right, it's probably
so radioactive

2:56:31.232 --> 2:56:33.017
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

2:56:33.191 --> 2:56:34.671
Not anymore.

2:56:34.845 --> 2:56:36.150
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

2:56:36.324 --> 2:56:37.325
Zoom.

2:56:41.460 --> 2:56:42.809
What the hell is he building?

2:56:42.983 --> 2:56:44.245
The Unity's in there.

2:56:44.419 --> 2:56:45.812
We'll attack from above.

2:56:45.986 --> 2:56:48.554
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

2:56:48.728 --> 2:56:50.600
only strengthen their bond.

2:56:50.774 --> 2:56:51.862
What?
So we can't blow it up?

2:56:52.036 --> 2:56:53.472
Not from the outside.

2:56:55.126 --> 2:56:57.432
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

2:56:58.172 --> 2:56:59.565
Fuse with it.

2:56:59.739 --> 2:57:00.958
Weaken its bond
from the inside

2:57:01.132 --> 2:57:02.568
so we can break it back
into three.

2:57:02.742 --> 2:57:04.701
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

2:57:04.875 --> 2:57:08.400
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

2:57:08.574 --> 2:57:10.881
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

2:57:11.055 --> 2:57:12.491
A billion years old.

2:57:12.665 --> 2:57:14.798
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

2:57:14.972 --> 2:57:17.104
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

2:57:17.278 --> 2:57:19.367
Just get me in
and get me time.

2:57:19.541 --> 2:57:20.673
You could die, Victor.

2:57:20.847 --> 2:57:23.110
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

2:57:27.898 --> 2:57:29.639
I got nothing left.

2:57:35.079 --> 2:57:36.950
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

2:57:40.084 --> 2:57:41.563
That's what I'm gonna do.

2:57:41.738 --> 2:57:44.175
Okay. So...

2:57:44.349 --> 2:57:45.872
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

2:57:46.046 --> 2:57:47.657
by fusing
with the doom boxes,

2:57:47.831 --> 2:57:50.137
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

2:57:50.311 --> 2:57:53.097
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

2:57:53.271 --> 2:57:55.447
Fighting the devil
and his army

2:57:55.621 --> 2:57:56.970
in hell.

2:57:57.144 --> 2:57:59.103
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

2:57:59.277 --> 2:58:01.540
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

2:58:01.714 --> 2:58:03.237
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

2:58:03.411 --> 2:58:04.935
And we have to assume
he's won.

2:58:05.109 --> 2:58:06.632
I don't care
how many demons he's fought

2:58:06.806 --> 2:58:08.199
in how many hells...

2:58:08.373 --> 2:58:11.942
he's never fought us.
Not us united.

2:59:02.340 --> 2:59:03.907
Take that as a "yes."

2:59:04.081 --> 2:59:05.386
What?

2:59:08.868 --> 2:59:10.043
The ring.

2:59:13.830 --> 2:59:15.353
You're really back.

2:59:48.865 --> 2:59:51.041
I have a second chance, Lo.

2:59:53.391 --> 2:59:55.785
And I am not gonna waste it.

3:00:49.186 --> 3:00:50.840
-

3:00:54.104 --> 3:00:55.279
Are you really you?

3:00:55.453 --> 3:00:57.107
I'm really me, Ma.

3:01:15.168 --> 3:01:17.170
Listen, Ma.

3:01:18.824 --> 3:01:20.826
They wanted me back
for a reason.

3:01:22.610 --> 3:01:24.090
I need to find out why.

3:01:44.284 --> 3:01:45.677
How's Victor doing?

3:01:50.116 --> 3:01:52.814
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

3:01:54.425 --> 3:01:57.602
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

3:01:57.776 --> 3:01:59.169
to go up against
the most powerful machines

3:01:59.343 --> 3:02:00.518
in the universe.

3:02:02.389 --> 3:02:03.869
It's not fair.

3:02:05.653 --> 3:02:07.220
I thought you didn't care?

3:02:08.700 --> 3:02:10.136
I never said that.

3:02:23.106 --> 3:02:24.498
What is it?

3:02:26.326 --> 3:02:28.285
Uh...

3:02:28.459 --> 3:02:31.549
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

3:02:31.723 --> 3:02:34.247
almost like a premonition.

3:02:34.421 --> 3:02:37.207
It was the end of the world

3:02:37.381 --> 3:02:40.210
and Barry Allen
was right here

3:02:40.384 --> 3:02:44.214
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

3:02:46.912 --> 3:02:50.089
She is... to Superman.

3:02:51.177 --> 3:02:53.266
Every heart has one.

3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:55.268
I think it's something more.

3:02:56.182 --> 3:02:58.010
Something darker.

3:03:02.232 --> 3:03:03.233
Master Wayne.

3:03:03.407 --> 3:03:05.583
Master Wayne!

3:03:05.757 --> 3:03:07.367
You need to see this.

3:03:30.695 --> 3:03:32.392
You fixed it.

3:03:32.566 --> 3:03:34.220
It wanted to fly.

3:03:35.526 --> 3:03:36.831
Flight is its nature.

3:03:37.006 --> 3:03:38.268
Yours, too.

3:03:45.144 --> 3:03:47.059
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

3:03:47.233 --> 3:03:49.453
What makes you so sure?

3:03:49.627 --> 3:03:52.151
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

3:04:14.304 --> 3:04:15.870
At last.

3:04:17.742 --> 3:04:20.397
Prepare for his arrival.

3:04:22.268 --> 3:04:26.359
My redemption is nigh.

3:04:34.280 --> 3:04:35.716
Unite.

3:04:40.895 --> 3:04:43.376
Synchronize.

3:05:27.768 --> 3:05:28.987
The satellites revealed

3:05:29.161 --> 3:05:30.684
he's created a defensive dome.

3:05:30.858 --> 3:05:32.208
It's a design flaw.

3:05:32.382 --> 3:05:34.471
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

3:05:34.645 --> 3:05:36.603
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

3:05:36.777 --> 3:05:38.170
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

3:05:38.344 --> 3:05:40.216
anyone would be that nuts.

3:05:41.260 --> 3:05:42.566
Bruce is right.

3:05:42.740 --> 3:05:44.350
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

3:05:44.524 --> 3:05:46.787
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

3:05:46.961 --> 3:05:48.659
What if the dome's
not destroyed?

3:05:48.833 --> 3:05:50.313
It'll be destroyed.

3:05:50.487 --> 3:05:51.923
Once Victor
is linked with The Unity

3:05:52.097 --> 3:05:53.490
with Barry's help,

3:05:53.664 --> 3:05:55.405
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

3:05:55.579 --> 3:05:57.015
Remind me,
how's that again?

3:05:57.189 --> 3:05:58.712
Uh, with the power of love.

3:05:58.886 --> 3:06:01.541
-Barry.
-With a catastrophic
energy surge.

3:06:01.715 --> 3:06:03.282
Good.

3:06:03.456 --> 3:06:05.066
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

3:06:05.241 --> 3:06:07.547
to generate
a charge of that size.

3:06:07.721 --> 3:06:09.854
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

3:06:10.028 --> 3:06:12.900
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

3:06:13.074 --> 3:06:14.946
And, Victor,
it's all up to you.

3:06:15.120 --> 3:06:18.384
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

3:06:18.558 --> 3:06:21.909
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

3:06:22.083 --> 3:06:23.781
We have a plan.

3:06:39.188 --> 3:06:41.233
The symbol  of the house of El means hope.

3:06:41.407 --> 3:06:43.583
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief

3:06:43.757 --> 3:06:47.413
in the potential of every  person to be a force for good.

3:06:47.587 --> 3:06:49.110
Clark...

3:06:49.285 --> 3:06:50.808
That's what
you can bring them.

3:06:50.982 --> 3:06:52.549
...you were
sent here for a reason.

3:06:52.723 --> 3:06:54.028
You will give
the people of Earth

3:06:54.203 --> 3:06:56.248
an ideal to strive towards.

3:06:56.422 --> 3:06:57.336
And even if it takes you

3:06:57.510 --> 3:06:59.382
the rest of your life,

3:06:59.556 --> 3:07:02.515
you owe it to yourself to
find out what that reason is.

3:07:02.689 --> 3:07:05.301
They will stumble,
they will fall.

3:07:05.475 --> 3:07:07.433
You're gonna
have to make a choice.

3:07:07.607 --> 3:07:10.001
They will join you
in the sun, Kal.

3:07:10.175 --> 3:07:12.003
A choice
of whether to stand proud

3:07:12.177 --> 3:07:14.135
in front of the human race
or not.

3:07:14.310 --> 3:07:17.400
You will help them
accomplish wonders.

3:07:34.634 --> 3:07:39.117
All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.

3:07:39.291 --> 3:07:42.686
I'm so proud of you, son.

3:07:42.860 --> 3:07:45.384
Your mother and I
loved you.

3:07:45.558 --> 3:07:46.951
Your mother and I knew

3:07:47.125 --> 3:07:49.083
you would change the world.

3:07:50.433 --> 3:07:53.392
Your heart was tested.

3:07:53.566 --> 3:07:56.090
I know
it's been hard, Clark.

3:07:56.265 --> 3:07:59.180
But you gave hope
to their world.

3:07:59.355 --> 3:08:02.532
You need
to show them who you are.

3:08:02.706 --> 3:08:04.882
Love them, Kal.

3:08:05.056 --> 3:08:07.145
The way we loved you.

3:08:09.626 --> 3:08:10.714
Fly, son.

3:08:11.802 --> 3:08:12.977
It's time.

3:09:16.780 --> 3:09:18.172
I'm gonna take out that tower

3:09:18.347 --> 3:09:19.913
and knock down
that shield dome.

3:09:20.087 --> 3:09:21.175
Whatever you see,

3:09:22.525 --> 3:09:24.440
stick to the plan.

3:09:26.398 --> 3:09:28.269
It's why
I brought you together.

3:10:08.397 --> 3:10:10.094
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

3:10:13.271 --> 3:10:15.926
Just have to knock
a little louder.

3:10:40.951 --> 3:10:42.561
Kill him!

3:10:42.735 --> 3:10:45.434
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.

3:10:50.308 --> 3:10:51.440
Oh, shit.

3:11:11.677 --> 3:11:12.852
The tower's down.

3:11:14.506 --> 3:11:16.377
Do you read me?

3:11:16.552 --> 3:11:17.640
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

3:11:18.815 --> 3:11:20.120
Are you okay?

3:11:21.382 --> 3:11:24.124
Bruce? Bruce?

3:11:24.298 --> 3:11:25.561
Get to the reactor.

3:11:25.735 --> 3:11:27.084
I'll lure as many
of these monsters

3:11:27.258 --> 3:11:28.781
-away from you as I can.
-What does that mean?

3:11:31.871 --> 3:11:33.743
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

3:11:33.917 --> 3:11:35.484
-

3:11:36.485 --> 3:11:37.529
They're here.

3:11:37.703 --> 3:11:38.748
Bruce?

3:11:41.881 --> 3:11:43.143
Comm went dead.

3:11:44.884 --> 3:11:46.103
Let's go.

3:12:25.055 --> 3:12:26.839
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

3:13:35.168 --> 3:13:37.562
-

3:13:46.876 --> 3:13:47.964
Critical damage.

3:14:28.004 --> 3:14:29.222
You really are
outta your mind.

3:14:56.162 --> 3:14:57.250
You're welcome.

3:14:57.424 --> 3:14:59.078
My man.

3:16:31.823 --> 3:16:33.477
Yeah, we got this.

3:16:33.651 --> 3:16:34.913
You go do your thing.

3:17:17.956 --> 3:17:20.872
-

3:17:30.839 --> 3:17:32.275
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

3:17:34.190 --> 3:17:35.452
Master Kent.

3:17:37.541 --> 3:17:38.977
He said you'd come.

3:17:40.761 --> 3:17:44.113
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.

3:17:55.037 --> 3:17:57.256
-Hey!
-

3:18:05.395 --> 3:18:06.700
Remember me?

3:18:09.268 --> 3:18:10.661
Round two?

3:18:11.401 --> 3:18:12.532
Hell yeah.

3:18:34.076 --> 3:18:35.425
Shall we?

3:18:36.426 --> 3:18:38.732
Tell me, Amazon,

3:18:38.907 --> 3:18:42.954
why did you
abandon your own sisters

3:18:43.128 --> 3:18:45.565
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

3:18:45.739 --> 3:18:49.047
clinging to their puny lives?

3:18:49.221 --> 3:18:52.094
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

3:18:52.268 --> 3:18:54.226
And, sadly, you could have.

3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:10.764
-

3:19:35.267 --> 3:19:36.965
Barry, I'm in position.

3:19:55.766 --> 3:19:58.899
Okay.
I built the charge.

3:19:59.074 --> 3:20:00.075
You call it.

3:20:01.337 --> 3:20:03.078
Barry, on one.

3:20:03.252 --> 3:20:05.515
Three, two...

3:20:08.387 --> 3:20:10.085
Get the hell off me!

3:20:10.259 --> 3:20:11.564
Victor!

3:20:26.971 --> 3:20:28.016
-

3:20:38.156 --> 3:20:40.028
-

3:20:47.644 --> 3:20:49.167
Victor!

3:20:53.084 --> 3:20:55.565
I watched your island burn,

3:20:55.739 --> 3:20:59.177
your sisters
begging for their lives.

3:20:59.351 --> 3:21:01.788
As did your mother.

3:21:01.962 --> 3:21:02.963
Liar.

3:21:28.728 --> 3:21:30.687
I can't maintain this!

3:21:31.601 --> 3:21:32.558
Victor!

3:21:54.841 --> 3:21:57.017
Victor, I can't hold this!

3:22:03.720 --> 3:22:05.939
For Darkseid.

3:22:09.900 --> 3:22:12.250
Not impressed.

3:22:56.816 --> 3:22:57.904
All right.

3:22:58.078 --> 3:22:59.645
Kal-El.

3:23:38.249 --> 3:23:40.425
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.

3:23:40.599 --> 3:23:42.514
I need the charge
to get inside.

3:24:04.623 --> 3:24:05.581
Barry?

3:24:06.538 --> 3:24:08.236
Barry, are you okay?

3:24:09.846 --> 3:24:11.021
Barry!

3:24:11.195 --> 3:24:12.370
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

3:24:12.544 --> 3:24:14.894
Need a few seconds,
that's all!

3:24:32.129 --> 3:24:34.436
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

3:24:34.610 --> 3:24:36.612
Okay, okay.

3:24:36.786 --> 3:24:39.354
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

3:24:39.528 --> 3:24:41.181
Heal. Heal.

3:25:07.033 --> 3:25:08.557
Barry!

3:25:21.526 --> 3:25:23.223
It's too late.

3:25:24.573 --> 3:25:25.965
Oh, no.

3:25:30.187 --> 3:25:31.841
He's here!

3:26:01.349 --> 3:26:02.698
Okay.

3:26:02.872 --> 3:26:03.829
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

3:26:04.003 --> 3:26:05.091
Far beyond the speed of light.

3:26:05.265 --> 3:26:06.571
You gotta break the rule,
Barry,

3:26:06.745 --> 3:26:08.356
and you gotta do it now.

3:26:21.412 --> 3:26:23.109
Dad...

3:26:26.983 --> 3:26:29.289
whatever happens,
I want you to know

3:26:32.031 --> 3:26:33.990
your kid was one of them, Dad.

3:26:37.254 --> 3:26:39.125
One of the best of the best.

3:27:34.572 --> 3:27:37.096
Make your own future.

3:27:43.581 --> 3:27:45.496
Make your own past.

3:27:50.153 --> 3:27:53.635
It's all right now.

3:28:40.769 --> 3:28:42.858
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.

3:28:44.033 --> 3:28:46.078
My broken boy.

3:28:48.559 --> 3:28:50.518
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

3:28:50.692 --> 3:28:52.345
We'll be together again.

3:29:00.223 --> 3:29:02.268
we can put it back, Vic.

3:29:06.621 --> 3:29:08.710
Make you whole again.

3:29:20.591 --> 3:29:22.332
I'm not broken.

3:29:24.813 --> 3:29:26.684
-

3:29:32.081 --> 3:29:33.909
And I'm not alone.

3:29:50.752 --> 3:29:51.709
Superman!

3:30:16.952 --> 3:30:18.780
-

3:31:22.408 --> 3:31:24.367
I told you

3:31:25.977 --> 3:31:28.588
Steppenwolf would fail.

3:31:29.546 --> 3:31:33.202
Yes. Yes, you did.

3:31:33.942 --> 3:31:35.421
My master,

3:31:35.595 --> 3:31:39.121
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

3:31:39.295 --> 3:31:43.125
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

3:31:43.299 --> 3:31:46.737
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

3:31:46.911 --> 3:31:51.524
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

3:31:54.702 --> 3:31:56.138
Ready the armada.

3:31:57.139 --> 3:31:59.532
We will use the old ways.

3:34:23.938 --> 3:34:25.983
Your father twice over.

3:34:33.382 --> 3:34:35.688
Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,

3:34:35.863 --> 3:34:37.647
not as a scientist,

3:34:37.821 --> 3:34:39.475
as a father.

3:34:39.649 --> 3:34:42.739
Your father twice over.

3:34:45.350 --> 3:34:48.745
I brought you into the world
and back to it.

3:34:48.919 --> 3:34:52.880
You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.

3:34:53.054 --> 3:34:54.620
Have always been.

3:34:56.884 --> 3:34:58.189
So many years
with you I wasted.

3:34:58.363 --> 3:35:01.714
So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.

3:35:04.195 --> 3:35:06.502
Everything breaks, Victor.

3:35:06.676 --> 3:35:08.896
Everything changes.

3:35:19.602 --> 3:35:21.647
I gotta go see my father.

3:35:57.248 --> 3:35:59.076
The world is hurt.

3:35:59.250 --> 3:36:00.338
Broken.

3:36:00.512 --> 3:36:02.950
Unexchangeable.

3:36:03.124 --> 3:36:04.647
Ship's
all yours now, kid.

3:36:04.821 --> 3:36:06.127
You're the boss.

3:36:08.477 --> 3:36:11.610
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."

3:36:11.784 --> 3:36:13.264
That's your thing.

3:36:15.963 --> 3:36:17.529
That's my thing.

3:36:22.621 --> 3:36:26.625
But the world's
not fixed in the past,

3:36:26.799 --> 3:36:27.931
only the future.

3:36:29.846 --> 3:36:33.719
The not yet. The now.

3:36:33.893 --> 3:36:37.245
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.

3:36:37.419 --> 3:36:38.724
Must be.

3:36:39.856 --> 3:36:41.510
Big round table.

3:36:41.684 --> 3:36:43.816
Six chairs, right there.

3:36:44.948 --> 3:36:46.558
But room for more.

3:36:48.996 --> 3:36:50.606
But room for more.

3:36:51.650 --> 3:36:53.391
God help us.

3:36:55.176 --> 3:36:57.134
The now is you.

3:37:00.877 --> 3:37:02.618
What?

3:37:02.792 --> 3:37:05.229
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

3:37:05.403 --> 3:37:07.797
But, uh,
my foot's in the door.

3:37:07.971 --> 3:37:09.494
This is like a "job" job?

3:37:10.321 --> 3:37:11.409
"Job" job.

3:37:15.152 --> 3:37:17.676
Your foot's in the door.

3:37:20.070 --> 3:37:21.158
Isn't that a thing people say?

3:37:21.332 --> 3:37:23.247
Your foot's in the door.

3:37:23.421 --> 3:37:25.728
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.

3:37:25.902 --> 3:37:27.469
-His foot's in the door!
-

3:37:27.643 --> 3:37:30.080
-That's my boy, right there!
-Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

3:37:30.254 --> 3:37:31.603
Taught him nothing he knows.

3:37:31.777 --> 3:37:32.648
-Dad, you're gonna

3:37:32.822 --> 3:37:33.823
get maced again.

3:37:37.305 --> 3:37:39.089
No stopping you now.

3:37:41.135 --> 3:37:42.397
Thanks, Dad.

3:37:42.571 --> 3:37:43.920
Now.

3:37:44.094 --> 3:37:47.010
Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.

3:37:47.184 --> 3:37:50.144
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

3:37:50.318 --> 3:37:53.625
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

3:38:04.114 --> 3:38:06.812
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

3:38:06.986 --> 3:38:08.988
I bought the bank.

3:38:11.426 --> 3:38:13.906
Congratulations, by the way.

3:38:14.081 --> 3:38:15.821
Do this. Be this.

3:38:15.995 --> 3:38:21.175
The man I never was.
The hero you are.

3:38:21.349 --> 3:38:23.655
Take your place
among the brave ones.

3:38:23.829 --> 3:38:28.617
The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.

3:39:01.345 --> 3:39:04.218
It's time you stand,

3:39:08.004 --> 3:39:09.484
fight,

3:39:12.139 --> 3:39:13.531
discover,

3:39:18.319 --> 3:39:20.364
heal, love,

3:39:23.976 --> 3:39:25.021
win.

3:39:51.656 --> 3:39:53.354
The time

3:39:53.528 --> 3:39:54.877
is now.

3:40:04.103 --> 3:40:05.322
Ready?

3:40:05.496 --> 3:40:06.715
Come on, Stevens.

3:40:10.762 --> 3:40:11.676
All right,
let's keep it moving.

3:40:13.635 --> 3:40:14.723
Keep going.

3:40:16.594 --> 3:40:18.248
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

3:40:21.947 --> 3:40:23.079
Luthor.

3:40:28.127 --> 3:40:29.085
Open up two, Carl, please.

3:40:38.268 --> 3:40:39.530
Luthor.

3:40:44.666 --> 3:40:46.189
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

3:40:46.363 --> 3:40:47.799
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

3:41:07.863 --> 3:41:10.126
-

3:42:16.453 --> 3:42:18.325
Ah, there he is.

3:42:19.108 --> 3:42:20.414
Welcome aboard.

3:42:20.588 --> 3:42:22.372
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

3:42:22.546 --> 3:42:24.418
I was just celebrating
God's return.

3:42:24.592 --> 3:42:27.116
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

3:42:27.290 --> 3:42:29.510
I heard
you were a few clowns
short of a circus.

3:42:29.684 --> 3:42:31.381
I was, thank you,

3:42:31.555 --> 3:42:33.557
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

3:42:33.731 --> 3:42:35.820
find some much needed clarity.

3:42:35.994 --> 3:42:38.083
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

3:42:38.257 --> 3:42:39.258
free of charge.

3:42:39.433 --> 3:42:41.130
Why the pro bono work?

3:42:41.304 --> 3:42:43.306
It's personal.

3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:46.222
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

3:42:48.355 --> 3:42:50.052
You said you had something
I'd want?

3:42:50.226 --> 3:42:51.575
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

3:42:51.749 --> 3:42:53.795
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

3:42:53.969 --> 3:42:55.710
No, I wouldn't think of it.

3:42:55.884 --> 3:42:57.146
Uh, I have too much
to live for.

3:42:57.320 --> 3:43:00.236
And more important things
to do.

3:43:00.410 --> 3:43:03.892
But if you want the Batman,

3:43:04.066 --> 3:43:07.112
here is something
that can help you.

3:43:08.462 --> 3:43:12.553
His name is Bruce Wayne.

3:43:15.817 --> 3:43:18.210
Hmm. On second thought,

3:43:20.604 --> 3:43:22.432
we do have something
to celebrate.

3:43:23.607 --> 3:43:25.000
Good boy.

3:44:29.325 --> 3:44:30.500
Clear.

3:44:36.071 --> 3:44:37.507
How much further?

3:44:38.813 --> 3:44:39.988
We're almost there.

3:44:42.294 --> 3:44:43.818
Well, we need to hurry.

3:44:43.992 --> 3:44:45.472
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

3:44:45.646 --> 3:44:47.256
He'll come for us.

3:44:50.259 --> 3:44:52.217
Let him come.

3:44:52.391 --> 3:44:53.958
Let the bastard come.

3:44:55.482 --> 3:44:57.440
I'll stab this
through his heart

3:44:57.614 --> 3:44:59.877
for what he did to Arthur.

3:45:00.051 --> 3:45:01.923
I want to make him pay.

3:45:03.707 --> 3:45:06.318
I understand
how you feel, Mera.

3:45:06.493 --> 3:45:09.321
You have no idea how I feel.

3:45:09.496 --> 3:45:11.280
But we have to
stick to the plan

3:45:11.454 --> 3:45:13.630
to have any chance
to make this right.

3:45:21.508 --> 3:45:24.902
Who have you ever loved?

3:45:39.134 --> 3:45:42.224
Au contraire,
my little fish stick.

3:45:46.010 --> 3:45:47.534
He knows exactly
what it's like

3:45:47.708 --> 3:45:49.405
to lose someone he loves.

3:45:51.407 --> 3:45:53.583
You know, like, uh,

3:45:54.976 --> 3:45:56.325
a father,

3:45:57.805 --> 3:45:59.981
like a mother.

3:46:00.155 --> 3:46:03.158
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

3:46:04.855 --> 3:46:06.814
Like an adopted son.

3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:12.210
Isn't that right,

3:46:13.777 --> 3:46:15.213
Batman?

3:46:18.477 --> 3:46:19.827
Maybe, in a way,

3:46:20.001 --> 3:46:21.655
that smelly
old flounder is right.

3:46:23.570 --> 3:46:26.224
Because how many
can die in your arms

3:46:26.398 --> 3:46:27.791
before you grow numb to death?

3:46:29.445 --> 3:46:32.404
That's not very careful.

3:46:32.579 --> 3:46:36.234
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

3:46:36.408 --> 3:46:39.150
before you die inside
yourself?

3:46:39.324 --> 3:46:42.980
I've been dead inside
a long time,

3:46:43.154 --> 3:46:45.113
but even I have a limit.

3:46:45.287 --> 3:46:46.941
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

3:46:47.115 --> 3:46:49.944
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

3:46:50.118 --> 3:46:51.859
You won't kill me.

3:46:52.773 --> 3:46:55.123
I'm your best friend.

3:46:55.297 --> 3:46:59.257
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

3:47:01.259 --> 3:47:02.609
Anyway,

3:47:03.958 --> 3:47:05.481
you need me.

3:47:06.525 --> 3:47:08.440
You

3:47:08.615 --> 3:47:11.400
need me to help you
undo this world

3:47:11.574 --> 3:47:14.185
you created
by letting her die.

3:47:16.797 --> 3:47:18.668
Poor Lois.

3:47:18.842 --> 3:47:21.628
How she suffered so!

3:47:27.503 --> 3:47:29.766
I often wonder

3:47:29.940 --> 3:47:31.768
how many
alternate timelines

3:47:31.942 --> 3:47:34.031
do you destroy
the world because...

3:47:35.250 --> 3:47:36.730
frankly, you don't have

3:47:36.904 --> 3:47:39.384
the cojones to die yourself.

3:47:40.385 --> 3:47:41.778
Hmm?

3:47:43.998 --> 3:47:45.173
So, as usual,

3:47:45.347 --> 3:47:47.741
I'll be the bigger man.

3:47:51.614 --> 3:47:53.050
A truce,

3:47:53.921 --> 3:47:55.574
Bruce.

3:47:58.012 --> 3:48:02.016
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

3:48:05.106 --> 3:48:06.063
But all you have to do

3:48:06.237 --> 3:48:07.456
is tear it in half

3:48:07.630 --> 3:48:09.153
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

3:48:09.327 --> 3:48:11.460
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

3:48:13.244 --> 3:48:15.029
to do a man's job?

3:48:18.510 --> 3:48:20.295
You know, it's funny

3:48:20.469 --> 3:48:21.731
that you would talk
about people

3:48:21.905 --> 3:48:23.515
who died in my arms

3:48:23.690 --> 3:48:25.387
because when I held
Harley Quinn

3:48:25.561 --> 3:48:27.998
and she was bleeding
and dying,

3:48:28.172 --> 3:48:31.698
she begged me
with her last breath

3:48:31.872 --> 3:48:34.135
that when I killed you,

3:48:34.309 --> 3:48:37.704
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

3:48:37.878 --> 3:48:39.706
that I'd do it slow.

3:48:40.924 --> 3:48:42.839
I'm gonna honor that promise.

3:49:13.478 --> 3:49:16.220
Oh. You're good.

3:49:20.572 --> 3:49:22.096
You almost had me.

3:49:41.637 --> 3:49:42.681
Where are we holing up?

3:49:42.856 --> 3:49:45.423
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

3:49:45.597 --> 3:49:48.426
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:51.081
-what do you think?

3:49:57.261 --> 3:49:58.175
He's found us.

3:51:27.395 --> 3:51:30.093
Can I help you?

3:51:30.267 --> 3:51:33.749
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

3:51:33.923 --> 3:51:36.926
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

3:51:37.100 --> 3:51:39.842
We have to find it
before he does.

3:51:40.016 --> 3:51:41.844
There's a war coming.

3:51:42.018 --> 3:51:43.802
And I'm here to help.

3:51:43.977 --> 3:51:46.196
I'm sorry, who are you again?

3:51:46.370 --> 3:51:48.503
I've gone by many names

3:51:48.677 --> 3:51:51.941
and taken many forms.
And like you,

3:51:52.115 --> 3:51:54.726
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

3:51:54.901 --> 3:51:57.294
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

3:51:58.078 --> 3:51:59.166
Oh.

3:52:00.907 --> 3:52:03.039
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

3:52:03.213 --> 3:52:06.390
So, glad you're here.

3:52:07.696 --> 3:52:08.784
You know, I never thought

3:52:08.958 --> 3:52:09.828
I'd see
the defenders of Earth

3:52:10.003 --> 3:52:13.049
united and fighting as one.

3:52:13.223 --> 3:52:15.530
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

3:52:17.053 --> 3:52:19.360
Your mother and father
would be proud.

3:52:20.752 --> 3:52:21.928
I hope so.

3:52:27.977 --> 3:52:30.937
Well, I'll be in touch.

3:52:32.025 --> 3:52:36.029
Oh, and some have called me

3:52:36.203 --> 3:52:38.466
the Martian Manhunter.

3:52:46.213 --> 3:52:48.519
I guess I'll see you around.

3:56:31.133 --> 3:56:35.877
a secret chord

3:56:36.051 --> 3:56:40.664
and it pleased the Lord

3:56:40.838 --> 3:56:46.061
for music, do you?

3:56:48.890 --> 3:56:52.546
The fourth, the fifth

3:56:52.720 --> 3:56:56.550
The major lift

3:56:56.724 --> 3:57:04.253
composing hallelujah

3:57:24.012 --> 3:57:28.321
but you needed proof

3:57:28.495 --> 3:57:31.889
on the roof

3:57:39.636 --> 3:57:43.031
to her kitchen chair

3:57:43.205 --> 3:57:47.165
and she cut your hair

3:57:47.340 --> 3:57:53.955
she drew the hallelujah

3:58:13.975 --> 3:58:18.240
I've been here before

3:58:18.414 --> 3:58:22.505
and I've walked this floor

3:58:22.679 --> 3:58:27.249
before I knew you

3:58:30.470 --> 3:58:34.038
on the marble arch

3:58:34.212 --> 3:58:37.912
a victory march

3:58:38.086 --> 3:58:44.875
it is a broken hallelujah

3:59:06.810 --> 3:59:11.249
when you would let me know

3:59:11.424 --> 3:59:15.950
on below

3:59:16.124 --> 3:59:21.216
that to me, do you?

3:59:24.306 --> 3:59:27.701
when I moved in you

3:59:27.875 --> 3:59:31.661
was moving too

3:59:31.835 --> 3:59:38.407
we drew was hallelujah

4:00:12.963 --> 4:00:17.707
a God above

4:00:20.318 --> 4:00:25.193
ever learned from love

4:00:36.465 --> 4:00:40.730
that you hear at night

4:00:40.904 --> 4:00:44.995
who's seen the light

4:00:47.084 --> 4:00:54.222
a broken hallelujah
