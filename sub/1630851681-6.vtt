00:05.206 --> 00:06.273
<i>Previously on</i> Hightown...

00:06.307 --> 00:08.109
My third leg's ready
for some exercise.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.610
In here, you respect me.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.145
I can float you a little
something to sell inside.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.179
<i>It's a good offer.</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:13.681
Smith found out
about what we were doing.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.216
I got to cut you loose.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.717
You came all the way
here just to see your old man?

00:16.751 --> 00:18.319
- It's good to see you, <i>flaca.</i>
- Yeah, you too.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.421
Ah, this chick has really
got you by the balls.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.022
<i>Haven't seen you like this
since Devonne.</i>

00:22.056 --> 00:24.291
Just call me back, please.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.727
Freeze!
Where's the fucking shark?

00:26.761 --> 00:28.162
You got played
by a fucking crackhead.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.630
Are you saying I'm too old
for this job?

00:29.663 --> 00:31.365
- Well...
- I want to talk.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.533
She wants to meet me.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.301
<i>Daisy was loose.</i>

00:34.335 --> 00:36.303
<i>Sold you out right to my face!</i>

00:36.337 --> 00:37.671
<i>Why do you hate me so much?</i>

00:37.705 --> 00:39.173
- Fuck!

00:39.206 --> 00:41.108
There's a really big mess
in the office.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.478

02:39.593 --> 02:40.928

and I'll--

02:55.709 --> 02:58.178
I don't fucking trust you.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.447
Okay, you're right.
You shouldn't. Just--

03:02.249 --> 03:03.651
Look, I'll...

03:03.684 --> 03:05.319
I'll do anything
you want, okay?

03:05.352 --> 03:07.755
I'll say anything you want.
Please just let me in.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.757
Please.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.425
<i>Please.</i>

03:17.932 --> 03:19.333
Come here.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.784
What happened to you?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.919
No, no, don't you
fucking touch me.

04:02.977 --> 04:06.413
<i>You're so fucking toxic
for me.</i>

04:06.447 --> 04:07.915
I wish I never met you.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.583
Don't say that.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.619
What do you want me to say?
What should I say?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.322
Say you love me.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.658
Oh, I did love you.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.827
And look what happened.
Look what you did to me.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.528
For what?

04:22.997 --> 04:25.265
Some big fucking ring?

04:25.299 --> 04:27.501
<i>I would have bought you
a thousand of those.</i>

04:27.534 --> 04:30.804
I sold my fucking soul for you.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.539
I know.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.677
And you're right.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.279
You're right about everything.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.982
You have to know

04:42.016 --> 04:44.718
that my life was ruined, too.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.791
I hate everything about it.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.429
Good.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.736
I can't do it anymore, Ray.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.792
I need you.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.686
Ugh, I'm such a fucking idiot.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.090
Fuck.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.867
<i>-This is Leslie.</i>

06:39.900 --> 06:41.468
<i>-You know what to do.</i>

06:41.502 --> 06:43.103
Call me back.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.981
<i>-Hi, it's Daisy.</i>

06:54.014 --> 06:56.116
<i>If you're boring or broke,
don't leave a message.</i>

06:56.150 --> 06:58.652
<i>But if you're my daddy,
then you know what I want.</i>

06:58.685 --> 07:01.488
- Yeah, hey, Daisy, it's Jackie.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.856
Just checking in.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.489
Here we go.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.691
Hey, Sarge,
you seen Babcock yet?

07:37.724 --> 07:39.960
No, not yet. Why? What's up?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.662
Nothing. Just planning my day.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.764
Why don't you plan on getting
Charmaine's number from Daisy?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.532
How about that?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.501
Yeah, boss, I'm working on it.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.006
Hey, there you are.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.041
Hey.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.177
Hey. Uh, can we talk for a sec?

07:57.211 --> 07:58.512
Not now.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.049
What?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.184
We're not having
this conversation at work.

08:04.218 --> 08:08.055
Wait, we can fuck at work,
but we can't talk at work?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.490
Anyone catches a whiff
of drama between us,

08:10.524 --> 08:12.559
we'll never hear the end of it,
so like I said,

08:12.593 --> 08:14.595
we're not having
this conversation right now.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.763
Okay, fine. Well, then
when you want to have it?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.966
I told you from the start that
sometimes coworkers hook up.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.901
No big thing.
Are you cool with it?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.203
You said yes. You're not cool.

08:23.237 --> 08:26.173
You took it way too far
way too fast.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.709
- Leslie--
- Morning, girls.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.877
Hey.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.747
Oh, hazelnut.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.749
Jackie,
if you're not feeling well,

08:35.782 --> 08:37.217
just take a sick day.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.519
<i>Oh, I hope you don't
have that stomach thing</i>

08:39.553 --> 08:41.088
<i>-that's going around.</i>
- Yep.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.090
I had it last week.
Sick as a dog.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.925
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- Coming out both directions,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.126
if you know what I mean.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.595
- You should probably go home.
- Oh, definitely.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.163
<i>Ugh.</i>

08:55.636 --> 08:57.604
Jesus Christ, Bill!

09:03.277 --> 09:06.246
I dream about you all the time.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.882
I dream about you.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.785
Good dreams?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.987
No, nightmares.

09:16.156 --> 09:20.027
But I'm sad when I wake up
and I realize you're not here.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.830
I'm sorry I gave
you nightmares.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.132
Me too.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.938
Mm.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.651
Can we just stay
like this forever?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.153
Yeah.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.959
- Who is it?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.660
I don't know.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.862
- Let's just ignore it.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.664
<i>Ray, come on, man,
I know you're in there.</i>

09:57.698 --> 09:59.066
<i>Your piece-of-shit truck's
out front.</i>

09:59.099 --> 10:00.600
Ah, fucking Jackie.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.602
The cop lady?

10:02.636 --> 10:04.004
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, okay?

10:04.037 --> 10:05.672
I'm gonna get rid of her, okay?

10:05.706 --> 10:08.241
- Ray, come on.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.111
<i>Hey. Not a good time
right now, Jack!</i>

10:11.144 --> 10:13.947
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important, man.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.819
Meet me out front.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.188
I'm gonna handle it.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.034
Hey.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.036
Jesus. What the fuck
happened to your face?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.904
Nothing, nothing. Why you here?
What's up?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.306
Um, I...I got to...

10:39.339 --> 10:41.241
I got to talk to you
about Leslie.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.977
We're having... issues.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.846
Issues? Like work stuff?

10:45.879 --> 10:47.714
No, no, not...not work stuff.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.950
More like, uh, uh...

10:51.818 --> 10:53.020
No.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.689
Oh, Jackie, are you out
of your fucking mind?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.124
It's complicated, okay?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.359
I mean, it started out as a
fling, but then it got serious.

10:59.393 --> 11:02.062
And, like, I thought
we were in love,

11:02.095 --> 11:05.365
but now she's, like,
not talking to me, so...

11:05.399 --> 11:07.434
Just tell me what to do.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.169
Why would I know what to do?

11:09.202 --> 11:11.071
I don't know.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.073
She ever pull this shit
with you?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.441
Like, all lovey-dovey
one minute,

11:14.674 --> 11:16.043
and then, poof, she's gone?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.078
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- All right, come on.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.946
So she told me about you guys.
So what? Who cares?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.882
I don't have time for this
bullshit right now, all right?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.350
I warned you--
Leslie was psycho.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.819
Don't get involved, okay?
You're on your own.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.687
"I told you so,"
that's all you got?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.459
Come on, man,
I'm fucking hurting here.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.062
Can we talk about this
another time, please?

11:37.731 --> 11:38.732
Fucking hell.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.406
- Hey.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.475
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.277
- Was it about me?
- No.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.779
- Why would it be about you?
- I don't know.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.949
I'm just freaking out,
you know?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.751
- I got to get out of here.
- Yeah.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.823
Can we talk for a second, hmm?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.326
You know, just me and you?

12:08.161 --> 12:09.863
What's going on?

12:12.365 --> 12:15.802
If Frankie finds out about us,
we're dead.

12:15.836 --> 12:19.306
- You know that, right?
- I'm not afraid of Frankie.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.007
Yeah, well, I fucking am.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.411
- Something happen with him?
- No.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.746
- Is that why you're here?
- No. That's not it.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.982
Okay.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.484
Then why did you come
right now?

12:34.921 --> 12:38.158
Because I missed you...

12:38.191 --> 12:40.527
and I couldn't take it anymore.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.863
Well, I'm glad you came.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.500
So when can I see you again?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.403
I don't know.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.273
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

12:53.306 --> 12:57.010
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

12:57.043 --> 13:00.881
And as long as we're really
fucking careful, nothing will.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.983
But you're gonna
have to trust me, okay?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.452
Can you do that?

13:05.485 --> 13:08.455
I need to hear you say it.
Say you trust me.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.557
I trust you.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.959
Good.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.428
Do you trust me?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.397
Yes.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.205
I have to go.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.164
- Ugh!

13:54.167 --> 13:57.437
<i>Come on! Come here!
You fucking bitch!</i>

13:57.470 --> 14:00.040
Help me! Help me!

14:03.376 --> 14:06.546
Get it together,
you fucking bitch.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.261
Jorge?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.196
Yeah, he came to the club.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.966
Helped me for a few minutes
and then left. Why?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.036
Yeah, he came to the club.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.172
I guess him and Daisy
got into it again.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.107
He was in a shit mood.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.581
Yeah, I fucking saw Jorge.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.951
I saw him watch videos while he
was supposed to help me close.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.253
I don't know.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.255
He said he had some shit to do
and then bounced.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.677
Hey, babe. How was the gym?

15:12.679 --> 15:15.181
Great. How was school drop-off?

15:15.215 --> 15:17.317
Fine.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.286
He's so excited
about the pageant.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.289
He wanted to wear
his turkey costume in the car.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.158
- You want eggs?

15:25.191 --> 15:27.027
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

15:29.195 --> 15:32.032
Uh, what about Jorge?
You think he wants food?

15:32.065 --> 15:34.467
Nah, he had to make a pickup

15:34.501 --> 15:37.337
<i>at the airport with Charmaine.</i>

15:37.370 --> 15:39.406
<i>What are you up to now?</i>

15:39.439 --> 15:42.242
Just got to shower
and get changed.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.210
Then I have a few things
to take care of

15:44.244 --> 15:46.479
at the club before the pageant.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.114
I'll meet you at the club.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.017
- We'll ride to school together.
- Sure.

15:54.688 --> 15:57.357
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪</i>

15:57.390 --> 15:59.526
<i>♪ Bitch, I'm Benji ♪</i>

15:59.559 --> 16:02.996
<i>♪ All of this money

16:03.029 --> 16:06.199
<i>♪ Every hair a new color

16:06.232 --> 16:08.702
<i>♪ Kidd Kenn new music

16:08.735 --> 16:10.537
Well, where's your ride, lady?

16:10.570 --> 16:13.373
- No idea.
- Well, I'm sorry.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.441
I mean, I'd give you a lift,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.109
but I got a charter
to Nantucket.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.345
It's cool.
I'll see you next time, Lance.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.412
All right.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.686
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

16:26.720 --> 16:29.222
- Yo, Jorge, your ass is late.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.257
Come get me.
I'm holding my dick here.

17:08.094 --> 17:09.596
You know we're gonna end up

17:09.629 --> 17:11.264
going back again tomorrow.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.732
<i>I know. It's...it's fine.
I'll go back.</i>

17:12.766 --> 17:14.167
- I don't mind doing that.
<i>Hi.</i>

17:14.200 --> 17:15.735
I guess
we'll just have to make do.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.137
Hey.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.074
Can I, uh...
can I help carry something in?

17:23.576 --> 17:24.644
Sure.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.331
This thing's a real turkey,
am I right?

17:49.536 --> 17:50.537
Ed.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.306
Ed, please, look at me.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.142
Ed, please.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.679
I'm sorry.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.651
I was completely out of line.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.719
And I...I shouldn't
have said any of that.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.656
I...I was upset
about some stuff with Leslie,

18:09.689 --> 18:12.225
and...
and I took it out on you.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.495
Okay.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.664
Okay, as in...
as in we're okay?

18:17.697 --> 18:20.667
Okay, as in I heard you.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.570
You're right, you shouldn't
have said any of that shit.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.173
You know,
I know it's hard to believe,

18:27.207 --> 18:28.441
but I got feelings, too.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.510
I know that.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.445
I am so sorry.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.383
The thing is you weren't wrong.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.186
What?

18:40.220 --> 18:43.690
You know, I've been doing this
a long time...

18:43.723 --> 18:46.259
and I'm tired.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.329
What do you mean? What the fuck
are you talking about?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.830
I'm retiring...

18:50.864 --> 18:52.398
after the holidays.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.501
No, no, no, you can't...
you can't do that.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.569
I was just fucking with you.
I didn't mean it.

18:56.603 --> 18:59.305
I mean, who doesn't get
a bad tip once in a while?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.574
Ed, listen to me, man.
You can't--

19:03.643 --> 19:06.212
I don't have anybody else.
You're like a--

19:08.781 --> 19:11.217
I just really like
working with you, okay?

19:11.251 --> 19:12.886
You can't do this to me.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.257
Nobody's doing anything to you.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.561
It's just time.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.797
And by the way, we haven't been
working together for months.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.232
That...

19:26.266 --> 19:28.501
- Then what are you gonna do?
<i>-I don't know.</i>

19:28.535 --> 19:30.203
Maybe I'll take up a hobby.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.171
Oh, come on,
hobbies are for housewives.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.740
You should be on the boat.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.875
I've made my peace with it.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.410
You should, too.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.248
Look, Linda and I got
a shit ton of stuff

19:42.282 --> 19:43.483
to do for Thanksgiving,

19:43.516 --> 19:45.952
so maybe, uh, it's time
to hit the road, okay?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.187
Yeah, well, uh,
I'm still invited, right?

19:48.221 --> 19:51.324
- Actually, Linda's...

19:51.357 --> 19:53.259
You know, we're...
we're just gonna do

19:53.293 --> 19:55.762
a small kind of family thing
this year, so...

19:55.795 --> 19:57.263
No. Yeah, yeah, it's...

19:57.297 --> 19:58.898
I...

19:58.932 --> 20:00.934
It's cool. I get it.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.638
See you, Ed.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.762
Happy Thanksgiving, Linda.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.497
<i>Jackie.</i>

20:34.968 --> 20:37.403
I don't know
what you said to him,

20:37.437 --> 20:39.639
but that man's heart is broken.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.876
I know. Yeah, I know,
and I feel terrible.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.679
- But I said I was sorry.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.814
Oh.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.950
- And did that fix it?
- No.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.785
So you can't just snap
your fingers

20:52.819 --> 20:54.988
and get your way
all the time, can you?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.289
Linda...

20:56.322 --> 20:59.492
How long has
he taken care of you...

20:59.525 --> 21:02.762
with your drinking and
your girls

21:02.795 --> 21:05.632
and your nonsense?

21:05.665 --> 21:08.835
He makes one mistake,

21:08.868 --> 21:11.671
and you treat him like that?

21:13.439 --> 21:15.341
Well...

21:15.375 --> 21:17.343
that's bullshit!

21:34.627 --> 21:36.295
Hi, there.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.331
Hey. I miss you.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.366
Oh, yeah?

21:40.400 --> 21:41.934
I miss you, too.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.770
What are you doing?

21:43.803 --> 21:47.040
I'm just pulling into Xavier's.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.542
Oh, yeah?
You working all night?

21:49.575 --> 21:52.311
Um, nope, I am working
the day shift today.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.380
What about after?
When can I see you again?

21:54.414 --> 21:57.717
Well, I have
a kindergarten pageant at four.

21:57.750 --> 22:02.021
But if I get a chance
to, um, sneak away after,

22:02.055 --> 22:04.023
I'll let you know.

22:04.057 --> 22:05.825
What are you up to?

22:05.858 --> 22:08.928
I'm just at home,
getting stuff done.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.530
<i>Yeah?</i>

22:10.563 --> 22:12.999
Well, I am walking into work.
We'll talk soon?

22:13.032 --> 22:14.367
<i>Of course.</i>

22:14.400 --> 22:16.035
Love you.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.503
I love you, too.

22:17.537 --> 22:18.571
Bye.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.812
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.748
Um, I need...

22:28.781 --> 22:32.585
another one
exactly like that one.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.457
You want
one .38-caliber cartridge?

22:39.058 --> 22:40.927
Yep.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.962
<i>My friends are all normies.</i>

22:42.995 --> 22:44.564
<i>They're like,</i>

22:44.597 --> 22:47.533
<i>"But don't you want
a glass of wine with dinner?"</i>

22:47.567 --> 22:49.001
<i>And I'm like, "Bitch, please!</i>

22:49.035 --> 22:52.572
<i>What the fuck am I gonna do
with one glass of wine? "</i>

22:52.605 --> 22:56.142
And now we got
the holidays coming up.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.444
<i>You know what they say?</i>

22:58.478 --> 23:00.580
<i>It's a threefold disease--</i>

23:00.613 --> 23:03.616
Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and New Year's.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.552
<i>-But I'm actually</i>

23:06.586 --> 23:10.857
<i>looking forward to seeing
my family this year.</i>

23:10.890 --> 23:13.793
<i>When I was drinking...</i>

23:13.826 --> 23:15.661
<i>I hated them,</i>

23:15.695 --> 23:18.431
<i>especially my dad.</i>

23:18.464 --> 23:21.801
<i>-Now that I'm sober...</i>

23:21.834 --> 23:24.804
<i>magically,
he isn't an asshole anymore.</i>

23:27.840 --> 23:31.177
<i>-Thanks for letting me lead.</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:33.546
<i>I guess for a topic,</i>

23:33.579 --> 23:37.116
I'd like to pick...

23:37.150 --> 23:39.585
gratitude!

23:48.427 --> 23:50.797
What the fuck is this wack shit
Quincy's talking about?

23:51.864 --> 23:55.201
<i>It's a simple move.
It's nothing.</i>

23:55.434 --> 23:56.669
It's in the sound.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.137
Yo, where you been?

23:58.171 --> 23:59.539
Supposed to be home
an hour ago.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.840
Asshole never showed up.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.042
I had to wait 40 minutes
for a fucking Uber.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.944
What'd you get me?
Is it a hoverboard?

24:04.977 --> 24:07.046
Ah, ah, ah! You got to wait
till Christmas!

24:07.079 --> 24:09.482
I'm gonna hide this, and don't
you go looking for it.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.450
- It'll be worth the wait.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.653
We about to have a Christmas
like we never had.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.022
What we doing today?

24:16.055 --> 24:17.123
Want to play <i>FIFA?</i>

24:17.156 --> 24:18.558
Oh, you want to get
your ass kicked?

24:18.591 --> 24:20.593
Bitch, you crazy, okay?
I've been practicing.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.562
Set it up. I'll be right back.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.264
What's up?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.765
Your boy never showed,

24:59.799 --> 25:01.567
so now I'm just sitting here
with a big bag of apples.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.202
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

25:03.236 --> 25:05.104
No, not on the phone.
Let's meet.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.745
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

25:12.778 --> 25:14.747
- Where you at, <i>primo?</i>

25:14.780 --> 25:16.616
Call me back.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.923
Mm-hmm.

25:23.956 --> 25:26.859
I need my car fixed.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.728
No, I need it today.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.596
<i>Because I don't have the money.</i>

25:30.630 --> 25:33.065
Yeah, because I lent you money
from my last check.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.603
I'll talk to you later.

25:37.637 --> 25:38.905
Everything all right?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.106
Fine.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.275
Just having some car problems.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.878
Split squats.

25:45.912 --> 25:49.148
Three sets of ten,
just like last time.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.952
Sounds like man problems to me.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.790
Here's the line.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.126
That question crossed it.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.595
It wasn't a question.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.230
<i>Look...</i>

26:05.298 --> 26:07.700
...I'm not trying to pry.

26:07.733 --> 26:08.968
I...

26:09.001 --> 26:12.738
Just--I'm a car guy.
Maybe I can help.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.341
It's a lost cause.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.045
Transmission's blown
on my hunk-of-a-junk Nissan.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.246
Not even worth fixing.

26:27.853 --> 26:30.856
All right, your shoulders
over your hips.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.660
Nice.

26:38.864 --> 26:40.166
There you go.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.407
Tell me why your boy
stood me up.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.276
Look, I don't blame you
for being mad.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.244
Believe me,
I'm not happy either.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.779
What happened?

28:33.813 --> 28:36.148
Me and the package took a
fucking Uber is what happened.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.818
And he just didn't show?
You haven't heard from him?

28:38.851 --> 28:41.120
Not since yesterday
when we confirmed for today.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.460
You telling me
you don't know where he's at?

28:47.493 --> 28:49.762
Don't worry about what I know.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.997
He's my cousin.
I'll deal with him.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.799
The reason I partnered
with y'all in the first place

28:53.833 --> 28:55.267
is 'cause I can't have shit
like this happening,

28:55.301 --> 28:56.735
and you said it wouldn't.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.905
Everything's under control.
I promise.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.140
Do you have it with you?

29:01.173 --> 29:04.143
Fuck, no. I'm not walking
around with that shit.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.277
Okay, sit tight.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.812
I'm gonna take care of you

29:06.846 --> 29:08.481
and throw something extra
for your trouble.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.182
Damn straight.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.209
Uh...

29:39.111 --> 29:40.913
Diet Coke.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.486
Thanks.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.865
Oh, shit.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.207
Hey, Devonne.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.377
Jackie. Hi.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.145
Hi. I haven't seen you
in forever.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.914
What are you doing here?

30:14.947 --> 30:17.049
This is my friend Riyah
from New York.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.250
I'm showing her the sights.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.985
Yeah? What are you in town for?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.220
I'm a painter.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.422
I got a fellowship
at the arts center.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.058
Cool. Cool, cool.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.526
So what's up?

30:27.560 --> 30:29.061
How you been?

30:29.094 --> 30:30.529
I'm... I'm okay.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.598
- How are you?
- I'm good.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.233
Yeah.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.902
I know the last time I saw you
was a little rough, but, uh...

30:36.936 --> 30:38.971
things are
totally different now.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.307
I'm actually working
with State Police.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.942
Moving on up.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.843
Wow. Good for you.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.078
Yeah.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.947
You look amazing.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.550
Jackie.

30:51.584 --> 30:52.952
What?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.055
I'm dating someone.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.256
That's cool.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.024
I just thought...

30:59.058 --> 31:01.260
I just thought we could get
a bite to eat sometime.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.998
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

31:07.299 --> 31:09.134
I don't know. You tell me.

31:14.940 --> 31:18.277
Ooh, fuck!

31:18.310 --> 31:19.578
Oh, shit!

31:21.413 --> 31:24.116
Oh, fuck, yes.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.130
Oh!

31:38.163 --> 31:39.999
Oh.

31:41.667 --> 31:42.968

31:45.271 --> 31:47.139
Oh, my God.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.474
Oh.

31:51.143 --> 31:54.146
- You are amazing.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.981
Hoo.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.484
Mm, I'm so glad Devonne
was cool with this.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.319
- You asked her?

32:00.352 --> 32:02.154
Yeah.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.990
She said she didn't give a shit
about what you did anymore.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.662
Mm.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.004
My turn.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.239
Yeah, no, no, no.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.640
I'm not into that.

32:21.674 --> 32:24.510
Yeah, well, you've never
done it with me.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.314
No, no, really, why don't
you just lay back down,

32:28.347 --> 32:29.682
all right?

32:31.550 --> 32:34.053
You mind if I...

32:34.086 --> 32:36.355
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.423
Mm.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.024
You know what?

32:39.058 --> 32:41.193
Actually, I'm gonna do this
on my own.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.062
You good to head out?

32:46.231 --> 32:48.367
Are you fucking serious
right now?

32:49.568 --> 32:51.370
Yeah.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.038
Oh.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.007
This is some bullshit.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.077
No one has ever treated me
like this before.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.747
You know what?

33:03.282 --> 33:05.751
Everything Devonne said
about you was true.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.389
Hey, thanks, though.
You were great.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.024
Let me know
when your show's up.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.225
Fuck off!

33:13.258 --> 33:15.060

33:43.622 --> 33:45.557
Ah, fuck!

33:55.667 --> 33:57.603
What's up, <i>jefe?</i>

33:57.636 --> 34:00.773
Something wrong
with your phone?

34:00.806 --> 34:03.375
Nah. I was sleeping, man.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.676
At fucking noon?

34:04.710 --> 34:07.746
Yeah, I was up all night
handling that thing.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.548
And?

34:09.581 --> 34:11.283
It's all good.

34:11.316 --> 34:13.318
It's like
she was never even born.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.521
- You seen Jorge since then?
- Nah.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.822
You talk to him?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.824
Nah, I ain't expecting
to neither.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.526
I figure he's off
licking his wounds

34:20.559 --> 34:22.628
after how you handled
his business.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.664
Mm-hmm.
That's what you figure, huh?

34:25.697 --> 34:27.299
Yeah. That's what I figured.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.504
I don't pay you to figure.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.640
I pay you to protect me
and my cousin.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.642
So I need you
to start doing your job

34:36.675 --> 34:38.644
and find fucking Jorge for me.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.648
Okay, boss.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.316
Okay, here's what you do.

34:44.349 --> 34:47.152
Call our friend,
the Plymouth cop,

34:47.186 --> 34:49.254

got picked up.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.489

42:43.194 --> 42:45.130

42:56.942 --> 42:59.711
I'm not calling her.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.648
Why was he even at the club
last night anyway?

43:03.682 --> 43:06.251
I mean, wasn't he supposed to
take Daisy somewhere romantic?

43:06.284 --> 43:09.154
Jesus Christ!

Yeah.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.975

44:04.009 --> 44:07.045
Thirteen-year-old
African American female,

44:07.078 --> 44:10.248

44:10.281 --> 44:12.884
No injection sites,
no indications of drugs

44:12.917 --> 44:15.020
entering the body
through any known methods.

44:15.053 --> 44:18.056
All signs point
to an accidental exposure.

44:21.092 --> 44:23.895
You knew her?

44:23.928 --> 44:25.230
Yeah.

44:25.263 --> 44:27.732
<i>Her name's, uh, Aileen Grasa.</i>

44:27.766 --> 44:32.437
The last ten,
15 years have been tough.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.206

ended up here.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.075

is the youngest I've seen.

44:42.013 --> 44:44.282
Was she brought in
or picked up?

44:44.315 --> 44:48.753

about two hours ago...

44:48.787 --> 44:52.157

44:52.190 --> 44:54.392

44:54.426 --> 44:58.196
EMTs were called
to 49 Neponset Road, Eastham.

44:58.229 --> 44:59.864
Get over there
and hold the house for me

44:59.898 --> 45:01.132

a search warrant.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.101

45:49.981 --> 45:52.317
Look...

45:52.350 --> 45:54.819
there's gonna be
an investigation,

45:54.853 --> 45:57.288
<i>but we already know
how she died.</i>

45:57.322 --> 45:58.756
<i>And we already know</i>

45:58.790 --> 46:00.492
<i>you've been working
with the Cuevas cousins.</i>

46:00.525 --> 46:02.527
You talk to me...

46:04.028 --> 46:05.797
...I can help you.

46:07.332 --> 46:10.034
Look, you're young, smart.

46:11.369 --> 46:13.972
This don't have to be the end.

46:14.005 --> 46:15.840
If you cooperate,

46:15.874 --> 46:18.209
you have your whole life
still ahead of you.

46:21.012 --> 46:23.348
My whole life there's been
someone sitting across from me

46:23.381 --> 46:25.383
telling me about myself...

46:26.518 --> 46:29.854
...teachers, social workers,

46:29.888 --> 46:31.222
cops.

46:33.558 --> 46:35.860
But no matter who it is,

46:35.894 --> 46:39.097
not once have I thought...

46:39.130 --> 46:42.133
"Yeah, now, that dude
know what's up."

46:42.167 --> 46:43.535
Not once.

46:45.403 --> 46:49.240
Your whole job
is to lock me up.

46:50.542 --> 46:54.145
So why am I supposed
to believe anything you say?

46:54.179 --> 46:56.881
You think I like this shit.

46:56.915 --> 46:58.216
Hmm?

46:58.249 --> 47:00.518
You think
I like coming down here,

47:00.552 --> 47:04.222
- ID'ing another brown body?

47:04.255 --> 47:05.890
No.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.392
I hate it.

47:07.425 --> 47:09.594
Now, I feel sorry for you.
I do.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.529
But you know how long
that's gonna last?

47:11.563 --> 47:14.499
About five fucking minutes.

47:14.532 --> 47:16.401
You ain't grown.

47:16.434 --> 47:17.902
But you grown enough

47:17.936 --> 47:20.305
to know better
than what you've been doing.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.907
But Aileen...

47:22.941 --> 47:24.876
she didn't know shit.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.079
You want to change your life?

47:28.112 --> 47:30.848
You want to do
something positive?

47:30.882 --> 47:33.251
I can help you with that.

47:33.284 --> 47:34.953
Really.

47:36.454 --> 47:40.325
But the time is now...

47:40.358 --> 47:43.962
this five minutes right here.

47:47.432 --> 47:50.268
You don't know shit
about my sister.

47:50.301 --> 47:52.203
And you don't know
shit about me.

47:54.138 --> 47:56.441
Do what you got to do.

47:56.474 --> 47:58.610
I don't give a fuck.

48:47.492 --> 48:49.360
Hey.

48:49.394 --> 48:50.995
What are you doing here?

48:51.029 --> 48:53.164
Nice to see you, too.

48:53.197 --> 48:54.599
May I?

48:58.002 --> 49:00.672
- How's it going?

49:00.705 --> 49:02.407
It's going great.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.342
Sorry I couldn't talk
this morning.

49:04.375 --> 49:07.111
But what's going on?
I can talk now.

49:07.145 --> 49:10.014
Ah, fuck that.
It's fine. I'm over it.

49:10.048 --> 49:12.417
Yeah? Is that why
you started smoking again?

49:12.450 --> 49:13.651
I don't want to hear
"I told you so," okay?

49:13.685 --> 49:14.986
If that's why you're here,

49:15.019 --> 49:16.354
you can fuck right off
the way you came.

49:16.387 --> 49:17.655
Huh.

49:17.689 --> 49:20.191
Y'know, actually, I had some
shit to talk to you about, too.

49:20.224 --> 49:23.027
Yeah, all right.
- I'm serious.

49:23.061 --> 49:25.663
I need your help
with the Cuevas case.

49:32.570 --> 49:34.539
- All right, what's up?
<i>-I was just wondering</i>

49:34.572 --> 49:37.375
if you guys are looking
at Renee for anything.

49:37.408 --> 49:40.111
Ray, what the fuck
are you doing?

49:40.144 --> 49:41.412
What?

49:41.446 --> 49:42.547
No, no, no, don't bullshit me.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.215
- Are you talking to Renee?
- No.

49:44.248 --> 49:45.616
Was that her in your apartment
this morning?

49:45.650 --> 49:47.018
Hey, Jesus fucking Christ,
Jackie.

49:47.051 --> 49:48.353
I came to talk to you
about the case.

49:48.386 --> 49:51.222
Yeah, right, the case, okay.

49:51.255 --> 49:53.224
Maybe you should go
back to therapy, huh?

49:53.257 --> 49:55.293
- You ever think about that?
- Wait a minute, what?

49:55.326 --> 49:56.994
You come in here, you're...
you're asking about Renee?

49:57.028 --> 49:58.363
Don't you think that's
a little sex addict-y?

49:58.396 --> 49:59.697
- I'm the sex addict?
- Yes.

49:59.731 --> 50:01.165
Uh-huh, I'm the sex addict?

50:01.199 --> 50:02.400
You're the one who came
crying to me this morning

50:02.433 --> 50:03.434
- about Babcock...
- No--

50:03.468 --> 50:04.469
...who you knew
was crazy bitch.

50:04.502 --> 50:05.670
Why? Because I warned you.

50:05.703 --> 50:07.071
Well, that's totally different,
all right?

50:07.105 --> 50:08.473
Renee ruined your whole life,

50:08.506 --> 50:10.074
and you're still thinking about
her, that's fucking crazy.

50:10.108 --> 50:12.110
Yeah, well, you fucking
your partner's crazy.

50:17.715 --> 50:20.284
Great talk.
Thanks for coming by.

50:47.645 --> 50:49.514
What the fuck, Jackie?

50:49.547 --> 50:51.616
Uh, can we please talk?

50:51.649 --> 50:53.251
I just want to know
what the fuck happened.

50:53.284 --> 50:55.186
I told you what happened.
You pushed it too far.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.655
So you fucking ghost me
out of nowhere?

50:57.688 --> 51:00.258
I'm an adult, Jackie.
I can do whatever I want.

51:00.291 --> 51:02.160
Okay, so...so what?

51:02.193 --> 51:04.295
So, all of a sudden, I don't
have a say in the matter?

51:04.328 --> 51:05.630
No, no, not all of a sudden.

51:05.663 --> 51:08.766
You never had a say
in my side of this.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.368
You understand that, right?

51:12.136 --> 51:14.138
So that's it?

51:15.840 --> 51:18.576
Why are you making
a whole thing of this?

51:18.609 --> 51:20.411
<i>We were just having fun.</i>

51:20.445 --> 51:23.147
No, this was...this was
more than "just having fun,"

51:23.181 --> 51:24.549
and you know that.

51:24.582 --> 51:28.186
Listen, I'm not saying
there weren't real moments,

51:28.219 --> 51:31.789
but that's all they were,
moments.

51:31.823 --> 51:33.658
And then that message
you sent me, "I love you."

51:33.691 --> 51:36.160
Come on, Jackie,
that was too much.

51:36.194 --> 51:38.129
Mm-mm, and then you got spooked

51:38.162 --> 51:40.331
because you had
real feelings for me.

51:40.364 --> 51:42.166
And then when I sent you
that text,

51:42.200 --> 51:43.434
you started to realize it.

51:43.468 --> 51:45.336
No.

51:45.369 --> 51:46.671
When you told me you loved me,

51:46.704 --> 51:48.673
I realized I wasn't being fair
to you

51:48.706 --> 51:51.175
because I don't feel
the same way

51:51.209 --> 51:55.213
because I'm straight, which
I told you from the beginning.

51:55.246 --> 51:57.181
So, when you were eating
my pussy,

51:57.215 --> 51:59.250
that was you being straight?

52:01.185 --> 52:03.821
It's almost Thanksgiving,
Jackie.

52:03.855 --> 52:06.390
Don't you have
any fucking place else to be?

52:34.252 --> 52:35.786
What was that about?

52:35.820 --> 52:38.890
He wasn't picked up.
Cops don't have him.

52:41.425 --> 52:43.761
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.899
It's my cousin, babe.

52:49.834 --> 52:51.569
I know.

52:51.602 --> 52:53.437
He's gonna turn up.

52:53.471 --> 52:55.740
You just have to stay positive.

53:00.611 --> 53:02.246
Shit.

53:02.280 --> 53:04.615
I forgot that I have to pick up
my birth control.

53:04.649 --> 53:07.285
You have to go? Now?

53:09.387 --> 53:13.891
We're gonna find him, okay?
Together.

53:15.359 --> 53:17.628
I'll be right back. I promise.

53:40.484 --> 53:41.852
- I don't have much time.

53:44.689 --> 53:46.691
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

53:46.724 --> 53:50.328
Why...why...why'd you
come see me today?

53:50.361 --> 53:53.297
I told you...
because I missed you.

53:53.331 --> 53:54.865
Uh-huh.

53:54.899 --> 53:57.835
How did you know
I live down here?

53:57.868 --> 53:59.370
I didn't.

53:59.403 --> 54:02.907
I knocked on the door upstairs,
woke up your tenant.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.675
I thought you trusted me.

54:04.709 --> 54:06.811
I'm trying.

54:06.844 --> 54:09.580
I'm really fucking trying.

54:09.614 --> 54:11.015
Help me.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.951
I know. I know. Look at me.

54:13.985 --> 54:15.953
Look at my life.

54:15.987 --> 54:17.822
Okay?

54:17.855 --> 54:21.692
I'm married to a drug dealer,
a fucking murderer.

54:21.726 --> 54:23.327
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to say that.

54:23.361 --> 54:24.629
No, no, I do. Let me say it.

54:24.662 --> 54:28.332
I want a life, okay?

54:28.366 --> 54:29.900
A real one.

54:29.934 --> 54:33.704
And I will never have that
with Frankie, okay?

54:33.738 --> 54:36.474
And I don't know if that's
enough to make you trust me,

54:36.507 --> 54:37.975
but it's the truth.

54:50.721 --> 54:53.424
If we're gonna keep doing
whatever it is we're doing,

54:53.457 --> 54:54.759
I need to know
what's going on with you.

54:54.792 --> 54:55.926
I know something happened.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.061
Something must have changed

54:57.294 --> 55:00.631
to make you come see me
this morning.

55:00.665 --> 55:02.700
Tell me.

55:02.733 --> 55:03.968
Please.

55:08.472 --> 55:11.008
I'm here now.

Happy almost
Thanksgiving, <i>flaca.</i>

56:07.398 --> 56:09.767
Yeah, you too.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.403
Where's Mom?

56:12.436 --> 56:15.539
She's at tía Gloria's
for Thanksgiving.

56:15.573 --> 56:16.907
Oh, you weren't invited?

56:16.941 --> 56:19.744
- What did you do this time?
<i>-Ah.</i>

56:19.777 --> 56:21.612
- She's got so many rules,

56:21.645 --> 56:23.614
who knows what I did?

56:28.986 --> 56:30.955
You want a beer?

56:38.496 --> 56:39.663
Yeah, why not?
