WEBVTT

00:02.751 --> 00:06.581
And this, Mariposa,
is Britta's Tacos.

00:06.581 --> 00:08.201
[blowing raspberries]

00:08.201 --> 00:11.251
No, no no no no.
It's pronounced "tacos."

00:11.251 --> 00:12.621
"Ta-cos."

00:12.621 --> 00:13.911
I had trouble
with it, too.

00:13.911 --> 00:15.161
I am so pumped!

00:15.161 --> 00:16.751
All I need is
50 more punches

00:16.751 --> 00:17.871
on my Frequent Eater card,

00:17.871 --> 00:19.331
then I'll win...

00:19.331 --> 00:21.621
the mystery prize!

00:21.621 --> 00:23.331
[gasp] I hope
it's a t-shirt!

00:23.331 --> 00:26.581
For 200 tacos, it better be
a lot cooler than a t-shirt.

00:26.581 --> 00:28.411
I think it's a shirt.

00:28.411 --> 00:31.791
All right, Mariposa,
I got your bottles,

00:31.791 --> 00:34.791
your teddy,
and your diaper bag.

00:34.791 --> 00:37.461
So what are we doing today,
besides eatin' tacos?

00:37.461 --> 00:39.201
Do?

00:39.201 --> 00:41.621
Summers are
all about relaxing
and doing nothing.

00:41.621 --> 00:46.001
Ohh, okay.

00:46.001 --> 00:50.751
After the year I've had,
nothing is all I want to do.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.581
I'm gonna
get some tacos.

00:52.581 --> 00:54.161
Tacos sound good.

00:54.161 --> 00:56.791
[struggling]

00:56.791 --> 00:59.251
Cloudyyyyyyy!

00:59.251 --> 01:00.911
Aaah!

01:03.081 --> 01:05.831
Welcome
to Britta's Tacos.

01:05.831 --> 01:06.791
Sensei?

01:06.791 --> 01:07.911
And Oskar!

01:07.911 --> 01:08.911
Hey.

01:08.911 --> 01:10.831
What are you doing here?

01:10.831 --> 01:12.831
Dude, I've been working here
for the last six months.

01:12.831 --> 01:15.041
But you'd know that
if you hadn't
just up and left.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.621
I see you're a dad now.
Figures.

01:17.621 --> 01:19.501
Classic Mango.

01:19.501 --> 01:20.831
Classic Mango.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.041
Dude! This is--
This is my sister.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.791
Oooh, I get it.

01:24.791 --> 01:26.291
You're hiding it
from Jackie.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.001
Don't worry, your secret
is safe with me.

01:28.001 --> 01:29.831
I'm not hiding anything!

01:29.831 --> 01:31.501
This is my sister.

01:31.501 --> 01:32.661
And even if she wasn't,

01:32.661 --> 01:34.701
there's no drama
between me and Jackie!

01:35.961 --> 01:38.251
[sigh]
Can I just get ten tacos?

01:38.251 --> 01:41.961
Hey, weren't we
supposed to hang out,
like, last summer?

01:41.961 --> 01:43.461
Yeah. Guess so.

01:43.461 --> 01:44.831
Whatcha been up to?

01:44.831 --> 01:47.041
I got a job
at Britta's Tacos.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.621
Niiiice.

01:50.001 --> 01:51.661
If I just pace myself,

01:51.661 --> 01:55.411
I should have
no problem knocking back
all 50 tacos today.

02:02.041 --> 02:03.621
That's four down.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.081
Ugh, it's gonna be
a long day.

02:07.081 --> 02:09.041
Why don't you just
have someone else eat them?

02:09.041 --> 02:10.081
[mews]

02:10.081 --> 02:11.371
All you need are the punches.

02:11.371 --> 02:13.791
Aw, yeah!

02:13.791 --> 02:17.081
[Southern California accent]
Five lengua tacos, extra lengua.

02:17.081 --> 02:20.331
Uh, excuse me.
Could I have your punches?

02:20.331 --> 02:21.791
-All right, kid!
-All right, kid!

02:21.791 --> 02:24.621
No, no, no!
Your Loyalty Card punches!

02:24.621 --> 02:26.291
I'm trying to get
the mystery prize.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.911
I dunno, man,
I really wanna punch you!

02:28.911 --> 02:31.041
C'mon, guys,
can you say no to this?

02:31.041 --> 02:32.961
[babbles]

02:32.961 --> 02:37.291
Whoa! How could I say
no to the father
of such a cute baby?

02:37.291 --> 02:40.041
Father? Oh, no,
I'm, uh-- Never mind.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.791
Awwww!

02:42.791 --> 02:45.081
That mystery prize
is as good as mine!

02:45.081 --> 02:50.501
So you mean to tell me,
I can't get apple slices
with my que-sa-dill-a?!

02:50.501 --> 02:52.871
Teachers?
Oh no no no no.

02:52.871 --> 02:54.751
I just ditched
an entire year of school

02:54.751 --> 02:55.831
while we were in Mewni!

02:55.831 --> 02:57.201
Push me under the table, Marco!

02:57.201 --> 02:58.201
-What?
-Just do it.

02:58.201 --> 02:59.621
Okay! Geez!

02:59.621 --> 03:02.201
Well, well, well,
Mr. Diaz!

03:02.201 --> 03:04.911
Getting along well
without an education?

03:04.911 --> 03:06.161
Uh-uh-uh!

03:06.161 --> 03:07.751
Read it and weep!

03:07.751 --> 03:08.961
I got my diploma
and everything.

03:11.831 --> 03:12.961
Eww!

03:12.961 --> 03:14.871
Oh, no!

03:14.871 --> 03:16.751
Put that
official business
away, Marco!

03:16.751 --> 03:17.791
It's summer!

03:17.791 --> 03:18.831
Crandle?!

03:18.831 --> 03:22.161
Did you follow me
from Mewni?!

03:22.161 --> 03:24.791
I don't know
what a Mewni is.

03:24.791 --> 03:26.331
I'm just here
in Echo Creek

03:26.331 --> 03:28.461
helping kids find
their lifelong posts.

03:28.461 --> 03:31.661
Uh, careers.
Good lifelong careers.

03:31.661 --> 03:34.121
Relax, m'boy! It's summer!

03:34.121 --> 03:35.871
Well, since everything
is cool,

03:35.871 --> 03:37.081
can I have your punches?

03:37.081 --> 03:38.081
Yeah, sure!

03:38.081 --> 03:39.121
Okey-dokey.

03:42.621 --> 03:45.581
Heh heh heh.
I'm never going to school.

03:45.581 --> 03:46.831
[ominous music]

03:46.831 --> 03:49.661
[heavy breathing]

03:52.001 --> 03:53.251
-Star!
-Aaaah!

03:53.251 --> 03:56.501
I thought you'd never
come back to me!

03:56.501 --> 03:58.001
Selfie!

03:58.001 --> 03:59.001
And pout!

03:59.001 --> 04:00.831
Now smolder!

04:00.831 --> 04:02.461
If we're gonna do this,
Mama needs a horchata.

04:02.461 --> 04:04.291
Marco! Earth money!

04:04.291 --> 04:06.871
Whoa! Nice baby!

04:06.871 --> 04:08.201
Thanks.

04:08.201 --> 04:09.791
I'm posting this right now!

04:09.791 --> 04:12.001
Wait, oh, Marco,
is it cool if I post this?

04:12.001 --> 04:14.871
You know,
because Jackie might see it.

04:14.871 --> 04:16.871
Uh, yeah, of course.
Why not?

04:16.871 --> 04:19.501
Some people get really awkward
when they run into an ex.

04:19.501 --> 04:21.001
You know, it's, like, drama!

04:21.001 --> 04:22.041
-[thud]
-Oh!

04:22.041 --> 04:23.291
Oops!

04:23.291 --> 04:25.161
It could get really weird!

04:25.161 --> 04:27.161
Everything's totally great
between Jackie and me.

04:27.161 --> 04:29.201
No weirdness here!

04:29.201 --> 04:32.121
Oh, that's good!
'Cause it's Taco Tuesday.

04:32.121 --> 04:35.291
Jackie always comes
to Taco Tuesdays.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.541
Well, I look forward
to seeing her.

04:37.541 --> 04:38.871
I gotta go to the bathroom.

04:40.751 --> 04:42.581
-[splash]
-Ahh!

04:42.581 --> 04:44.371
What does Starfan know?

04:44.371 --> 04:46.621
It's not gonna be weird
to see Jackie.

04:46.621 --> 04:48.081
We're friends.

04:48.081 --> 04:50.251
I thought me and my ex
were cool.

04:50.251 --> 04:54.001
But last year, I ran into her
at this very taco stand.

04:54.001 --> 04:56.251
It was terrifying!

04:56.251 --> 05:00.041
And she threatened to squeeze
hot sauce into my eye!

05:00.041 --> 05:03.541
And I've been hiding out
in this here stall ever since.

05:03.541 --> 05:05.121
Well, that's you, man.

05:05.121 --> 05:07.751
Jackie and I, we had
a healthy relationship.

05:07.751 --> 05:09.871
Yeah? Well,
why'd you break up then?

05:09.871 --> 05:11.911
Oh, well, you know,

05:11.911 --> 05:16.501
'cause she thought
I was in love
with my best friend.

05:16.501 --> 05:20.371
Oh, brah, that's, like,
way worse than what I did.

05:20.371 --> 05:24.371
Oh, no! I was
a terrible boyfriend.

05:24.371 --> 05:25.961
-[Starfan] Yoo-hoo, Marco!
-[pounding]

05:25.961 --> 05:28.291
Guess who's here?!
You have a visitor!

05:28.291 --> 05:29.291
Marco!

05:29.291 --> 05:30.911
[whispers] Jackie!

05:30.911 --> 05:33.961
[Starfan] Marco! Marco!
Marco! Marco! Marco!

05:33.961 --> 05:35.251
Great work, Star!

05:35.251 --> 05:36.751
Yeah. Yeah, you bet.

05:39.871 --> 05:41.501
[Ferguson and Alfonso]
Hey, Marco!

05:41.501 --> 05:43.871
-Huh?
-Ha ha ha! Marco!

05:43.871 --> 05:45.081
It's so good to see you.

05:45.081 --> 05:46.251
Are you all right, man?

05:46.251 --> 05:47.251
You look
a little freaked.

05:47.251 --> 05:48.661
No, no, I'm fine.

05:48.661 --> 05:49.701
I mean,
I just thought you guys

05:49.701 --> 05:52.081
were maybe Jackie or something.

05:52.081 --> 05:55.001
Jackie? Naw, last I heard,
she was studying
abroad in France,

05:55.001 --> 05:57.251
so I don't think she'll
be coming by anytime soon.

05:57.251 --> 05:59.121
I mean, unless
she wants a taco.

05:59.121 --> 06:01.961
Ha! Say hello
to our new D and D group!

06:01.961 --> 06:03.961
What up?

06:03.961 --> 06:05.831
These guys play D and D?

06:05.831 --> 06:09.411
Oh, being a nerd
has gotten super cool
since you've left.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.001
Special delivery from Star!

06:12.001 --> 06:13.621
-What the heck?!
-[giggles]

06:13.621 --> 06:15.961
Cool, Star and Marco
had a baby!

06:15.961 --> 06:17.201
No! It's not our baby--

06:17.201 --> 06:18.831
Aw, cool! Star's here!

06:18.831 --> 06:19.961
Guys, this is the one
I was telling you about.

06:19.961 --> 06:21.161
She does real magic.

06:21.161 --> 06:22.501
Hey, Star!

06:22.501 --> 06:25.081
Can you conjure
a unicorn stampede?

06:25.081 --> 06:27.081
Awww, unicorns.

06:27.081 --> 06:30.541
Sorry, guys, she's kinda busy
at the moment doing nothing.

06:30.541 --> 06:33.291
See?
Just like an old cat!

06:33.291 --> 06:35.621
[crazed laughter]

06:35.621 --> 06:37.661
I could do this all day!

06:37.661 --> 06:40.661
Here's 30 tacos
and 30 punches.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.661
I'm getting really close!

06:42.661 --> 06:43.961
Thanks
for the punches, guys.

06:43.961 --> 06:44.961
Naw, sure thing, Marco!

06:44.961 --> 06:46.001
Hey, I'll see ya!

06:46.001 --> 06:47.831
Gotta go crush some elves!

06:47.831 --> 06:49.541
I'm sure we'll see you
really soon though!

06:53.871 --> 06:55.331
[crunch]

06:55.331 --> 06:56.911
[swallows, exhales]

06:56.911 --> 06:59.911
I just need
two more punches.

06:59.911 --> 07:03.251
Ohh! Why hasn't
anyone else come by?

07:03.251 --> 07:05.791
This is more
of a lunch place, actually.

07:05.791 --> 07:07.201
Wait! Janna!

07:07.201 --> 07:09.661
She can get me
a few punches, I bet!

07:09.661 --> 07:11.081
Hold on there, bro.

07:11.081 --> 07:13.501
Janna isn't welcome
around here anymore!

07:13.501 --> 07:15.961
She's banned for life!

07:17.911 --> 07:19.251
Ugh!

07:19.251 --> 07:21.661
Looks like
it's up to you, Diaz.

07:21.661 --> 07:22.751
Let's get this
over with.

07:22.751 --> 07:24.081
[babbling]

07:24.081 --> 07:26.541
Two tacos, please.

07:26.541 --> 07:27.911
Bad news, Marco.

07:27.911 --> 07:29.501
You bought us
out of every ingredient.

07:29.501 --> 07:31.041
All we have
to make tacos with

07:31.041 --> 07:34.201
are these home grown Echo Creek
white hot pain peppers.

07:34.201 --> 07:36.081
[urp]

07:36.081 --> 07:37.831
Haven't those been outlawed
in, like, 16 states?

07:37.831 --> 07:39.001
What am I? A cop?

07:39.001 --> 07:40.911
Embrace the pain!

07:40.911 --> 07:43.041
[sigh]
Nah, man, I'm done.

07:43.041 --> 07:46.201
My quest for the mystery prize
is a bust.

07:46.201 --> 07:49.201
Two punches!
I just needed two!

07:49.201 --> 07:51.041
Ow! Ow! Huh?!

07:51.041 --> 07:53.791
You want chips
on the side?

07:53.791 --> 07:55.041
Jackie?
I thought you were...

07:55.041 --> 07:56.751
Hi!

07:56.751 --> 07:58.751
Aww, who's
this little lady?

07:58.751 --> 08:00.121
Looks like
you've been busy.

08:00.121 --> 08:01.331
She's not mine!

08:01.331 --> 08:03.251
I mean...
she's-- she's mine,

08:03.251 --> 08:05.201
just not, mine mine.

08:05.201 --> 08:06.911
She's my sister.

08:06.911 --> 08:09.541
[laughs] Classic Diaz.

08:09.541 --> 08:12.161
Oh, hey, I've got somebody
I'd like you to meet.

08:12.161 --> 08:13.331
Bonjour!

08:13.331 --> 08:14.961
Chloe. Meet Marco!

08:14.961 --> 08:17.701
Oh, hi! How do you guys
know each other?

08:17.701 --> 08:19.501
We met in France.

08:19.501 --> 08:22.201
She taught me all about the
beauty of French architecture

08:22.201 --> 08:24.461
and how to do
sweet parkour off it.

08:24.461 --> 08:25.541
Montre-lui, Chloe!

08:25.541 --> 08:26.661
D'accord!

08:28.161 --> 08:30.121
She's so cool.

08:30.121 --> 08:31.331
Voila!

08:31.331 --> 08:32.701
Now I'm showing her

08:32.701 --> 08:34.331
the coolest
of Echo Creek life--

08:34.331 --> 08:37.041
skateboarding
and pain pepper tacos!

08:37.041 --> 08:38.121
Pain pepper tacos?

08:38.121 --> 08:40.201
Hey, if you give me
your two punches,

08:40.201 --> 08:42.161
I'll buy them for you.

08:42.161 --> 08:44.501
Dude, Diaz!
What a gentleman.

08:44.501 --> 08:46.331
Ready for ze pain?

08:46.331 --> 08:47.911
[together]
Un, deux, trois!

08:49.201 --> 08:50.461
-Aah!
-Oh, that's unreal!

08:50.461 --> 08:52.081
Oh, my gosh,
it's so spicy!

08:52.081 --> 08:54.251
-[laughing]
-[Chloe] It's so brilliant!

08:54.251 --> 08:56.331
Well, Marco,
thanks for the tacos.

08:56.331 --> 08:58.251
It's really nice
to see you.

08:58.251 --> 09:02.871
Really? 'Cause I wasn't sure
if things were cool between us.

09:02.871 --> 09:04.291
Of course things
are cool, bro.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.121
You just bought us tacos.

09:06.121 --> 09:07.701
I don't know.

09:07.701 --> 09:10.331
I was in the bathroom,
thinking about life,

09:10.331 --> 09:12.501
and it dawned on me:

09:12.501 --> 09:17.201
Marco, you were
a terrible boyfriend
to Jackie.

09:17.201 --> 09:19.201
And you're Jackie.

09:19.201 --> 09:21.501
[laughing]

09:21.501 --> 09:23.001
What?

09:23.001 --> 09:25.541
Nothing.
You're just the best.

09:25.541 --> 09:28.581
Look, as boyfriends go,
you were pretty standard.

09:28.581 --> 09:30.661
But you always knew
how to make me laugh.

09:30.661 --> 09:32.291
Standard?

09:32.291 --> 09:34.331
You're not just saying that?

09:34.331 --> 09:36.581
Look, I learned a lot
about myself in France,

09:36.581 --> 09:39.161
and we just weren't
the best match.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.701
And that's okay.

09:40.701 --> 09:42.461
It doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

09:42.461 --> 09:45.751
Yeah, that's
what I was hoping.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.411
[sobbing]

09:47.411 --> 09:51.661
-That's sooo beautiful!
-[slapping]

09:51.661 --> 09:53.871
Okay, Marco,
well, we better get going.

09:53.871 --> 09:55.201
Bye, Star!

09:55.201 --> 09:57.371
Bye, Jackie!

09:57.371 --> 09:59.831
Now, she's
a special girl, Marco.

09:59.831 --> 10:01.541
Make sure you don't
mess that one up.

10:01.541 --> 10:02.831
Stay amazing.

10:02.831 --> 10:04.081
Au revoir.

10:06.541 --> 10:08.041
Bye.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.751
[gasp] Marco's got
all 50 punches!

10:15.081 --> 10:16.501
Prize! Now!

10:16.501 --> 10:18.411
Sorry, the prize
has been stolen.

10:18.411 --> 10:19.621
[nervous laugh]

10:19.621 --> 10:22.161
What?! Well, what was it?!

10:22.161 --> 10:23.331
A t-shirt.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.831
Said "Britta's Tacos" on it.

10:24.831 --> 10:26.621
Pretty sweet.

10:26.621 --> 10:30.911
You know, the real prize
was getting to see
all our friends.

10:30.911 --> 10:32.831
[heavy breathing]

10:32.831 --> 10:35.961
Friends!

10:35.961 --> 10:37.751
[urp]

10:37.751 --> 10:39.791
I think I just
threw up a little bit.
