MY EMERGENCY BULLDOG.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.299
I THINK I'LL CALL YOU BARKIE.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.978
IT'S NEXT TO THE UNIVERSAL
RODENT-TO-ENGLISH TRANSLATOR.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.046

09:40.112 --> 09:41.380
HELP!

09:41.447 --> 09:42.915
squeak! squeak! squeak!

09:42.982 --> 09:44.917
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE TIMMY.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.886
A MOUSE WITH A PINK HAT?

09:46.953 --> 09:49.055
A CAT WITH A PONYTAIL?

09:49.121 --> 09:51.057
OH, THAT CAN ONLY MEAN
ONE THING.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.092
- [giggles]

09:53.159 --> 09:55.628
- POOF, DID YOU
TURN TIMMY AND VICKY

09:55.695 --> 09:58.397
INTO SLEAZY AND CHEEZY
BECAUSE I TOOK THE TV AWAY?

09:58.464 --> 09:59.832
- POOF POOF.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.500
- I KNOW YOU'RE SORRY,

10:01.567 --> 10:04.003
BUT THAT WAS VERY DANGEROUS,
YOUNG MAN.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.005
TIMMY COULD HAVE
REALLY GOTTEN HURT.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.240

10:23.656 --> 10:25.758
[whistling noise]
smash!

10:25.825 --> 10:27.026

10:33.766 --> 10:35.001

SQUEAK INTO THIS.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.210
- [snarling]

10:45.978 --> 10:48.514
- I WISH EVERYTHING
WAS BACK TO NORMAL.

10:55.187 --> 10:56.155
crash!

10:56.222 --> 10:57.390
- HMM.

10:57.456 --> 10:59.291
THAT WAS A WEIRD DREAM.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.760
HOW'D I GET OUTSIDE?

11:00.826 --> 11:02.061
[coughs]

11:02.128 --> 11:04.330
AND WHY AM I
COUGHING UP PINK FEATHERS?

11:04.397 --> 11:05.731
[chiming]

11:05.798 --> 11:08.601
AND WHY DO I CRAVE MILK?

11:08.667 --> 11:11.537
MEOW!

11:11.604 --> 11:13.072
- BYE, VICKY.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.707
SASSY, SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THE BABYSITTER.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.042

11:18.511 --> 11:20.846
- WELL, I HOPE YOU BOYS
LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.581
- WE SURE DID, WANDA.

11:22.648 --> 11:25.384
POOF AND I WILL NEVER
WATCH <i> SLEAZY AND CHEEZY</i> AGAIN.

11:25.451 --> 11:26.819

11:26.886 --> 11:27.787
A TV!

11:27.853 --> 11:28.888
I DID IT!

11:28.954 --> 11:30.489

12:25.411 --> 12:30.449
[all cheer]

12:30.516 --> 12:34.954
TRIXIE,
TELL HIM WHAT HE'S WON.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.755
- CAN I GET A SPOTLIGHT
OR SOMETHING?

12:36.822 --> 12:38.090
- JUST READ THE CARD.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.159

YOU'LL FINALLY LEARN TO...

12:47.066 --> 12:48.901
SHAPE UP!

12:48.968 --> 12:51.937
YOUR DAY STARTS AT 5:00 A.M.
WITH BASIC TRAINING.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.772

12:53.839 --> 12:55.674
YOU'LL DO 1,000 PUSH-UPS,

12:55.741 --> 12:59.445
RUN A GRUELING OBSTACLE COURSE,

12:59.512 --> 13:01.046
THEN PRACTICE
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT

13:01.113 --> 13:02.548
WITH A GRIZZLY BEAR.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.984
- HOW'S THAT
GONNA HELP ME GET BETTER GRADES?

13:05.050 --> 13:06.752
- DON'T SASS ME, SOLDIER!

13:06.819 --> 13:09.188
BESIDES, IT'S ALL JUST A RUSE

13:09.255 --> 13:11.190
SO I CAN GET YOU ALONE
AND CAPTURE YOUR

13:11.257 --> 13:13.425
FAIRY GODPARENTS!

13:13.492 --> 13:14.793
- I HEARD THAT.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.362
- ALL I NEED
ARE YOUR PARENTS' SIGNATURES

13:16.428 --> 13:17.897
ON THIS PERMISSION SLIP,

13:17.963 --> 13:20.599
AND I'LL BE AT YOUR HOUSE
AT 1800 HOURS TO GET THEM.

13:20.666 --> 13:22.067
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.702
MY MOM AND DAD
WOULD NEVER PUT ME

13:23.769 --> 13:25.804
IN YOUR STUPID MILITARY SCHOOL.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.873
- HOORAY!

13:27.940 --> 13:30.209
TIMMY'S GOING
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.878
- WHAT?
YOU GUYS CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.481
- SURE, WE ARE.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.983
MILITARY SCHOOL
WILL BE GREAT FOR YOU, SON.

13:38.050 --> 13:41.954
YOU'LL LEARN STUFF LIKE RULES
AND DISCIPLINE AND--

13:42.021 --> 13:44.757
- WE CAN FINALLY
RENT OUT YOUR ROOM.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.192
- HE-WHY-HUP!

13:46.258 --> 13:48.661
NAILED IT!

13:48.727 --> 13:51.130
- BUT YOU GUYS CAN'T SIGN
THAT PERMISSION SLIP!

13:51.197 --> 13:52.398
both: WHY NOT?

13:52.464 --> 13:56.001
- BECAUSE...
YOU'RE OUT OF PENCILS.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.404
- NO PROBLEM.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.440
[glass shatters]

14:01.507 --> 14:03.475

14:15.921 --> 14:17.256
- WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON?

14:17.323 --> 14:19.124
WHY IS MY ROOM A BATTLEFIELD?

14:19.191 --> 14:20.259
- IT'S POOF.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.461
WE CAN'T GET HIM
TO TAKE HIS NAP,

14:22.528 --> 14:23.929
AND HE'S TURNED INTO
A SLEEP-DEPRIVED

14:23.996 --> 14:25.864
WORLD WAR II FIGHTER PLANE.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.333
- [screams]

14:27.399 --> 14:29.935
- BUT, GUYS, MY PARENTS
ARE ABOUT TO SIGN ME AWAY

14:30.002 --> 14:31.770
TO CROCKER'S
MILITARY ACADEMY.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.505
I NEED YOUR MAGIC NOW.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.075
[whistling noise]

14:36.141 --> 14:38.043
- AH!
DIAPER IN THE HOLE.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.479
I'LL SAVE US.

squish!
YUCK.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.382
kaboom!

14:43.449 --> 14:44.783
BAD IDEA.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.051
- SORRY, SPORT,

14:46.118 --> 14:48.921
WE CAN'T HELP YOU
TILL WE GET POOF DOWN.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.223
I'M WHIPPING UP
A MAGIC BABY FORMULA

14:51.290 --> 14:53.626
THAT'S GUARANTEED
TO PUT HIM TO SLEEP.

14:53.692 --> 14:54.860
OH, LET'S SEE:

14:54.927 --> 14:57.396
BORING ELEVATOR MUSIC,

14:57.463 --> 15:00.332
A GUIDE

15:00.399 --> 15:04.570
AND A SIX-HOUR DOCUMENTARY
ON THE HISTORY OF YARN.

15:04.637 --> 15:05.638
THERE.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.406
THAT SHOULD PUT
ANYONE TO SLEEP.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.807
[doorbell rings]

15:08.874 --> 15:11.143
- OH, NO!
CROCKER'S HERE.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.411
- MR. CROCKER,

15:12.478 --> 15:13.846
PLEASE COME IN.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.281

15:15.347 --> 15:17.216
NOW, JUST SIGN HERE,
AND THOSE FAIRIES--

15:17.283 --> 15:20.319
I MEAN, TIMMY'S
SUCCESSFUL FUTURE IS IN THE BAG.

15:20.386 --> 15:24.123
both: WHY NOT?

15:24.189 --> 15:26.525
- OH, MY GOSH, THEY SIGNED IT!

15:26.592 --> 15:28.427
- [gasps]
OH, MY GOSH.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.696
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS
OUR LITTLE GIRL.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.165
- ME TOO.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.567
HEY, HOW ABOUT
A GLASS OF LEMONADE

15:35.634 --> 15:38.103
TO CELEBRATE
OUR NEW SPARE ROOM?

15:38.170 --> 15:39.872
- ACTUALLY,
I NEED TO USE THE LATRINE.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.740
IT WAS A BUMPY RIDE
IN THE FAIRY-CATCHING VAN--

15:41.807 --> 15:43.575
I MEAN,
OFFICIAL MILITARY VEHICLE.

15:43.642 --> 15:44.543
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.413
both: TO MILITARY SCHOOL!

15:47.479 --> 15:51.216
- GUYS, MY PARENTS JUST SIGNED
CROCKER'S PERMISSION SLIP.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.651

ROAR!

16:02.227 --> 16:05.197
- WHOA, I NEVER REALIZED
MY ROOM WAS SO BIG.

16:05.264 --> 16:06.932
- I'LL DRAW HIS FIRE!

16:06.999 --> 16:09.201
BAD IDEA.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.003
- HERE'S THE FORMULA, POOF.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.171

[both moan]

16:28.220 --> 16:29.688
[lasers zinging]

16:29.755 --> 16:31.924
- GUYS, MY MOM AND DAD DRANK
THE FORMULA AND FELL ASLEEP.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.826
I WISH THEY'D WAKE UP
AND TELL CROCKER

16:33.892 --> 16:37.162
THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR MINDS
ABOUT MILITARY SCHOOL.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.764
[both scream]
- HEY!

16:38.831 --> 16:40.132

both: OH!

16:43.435 --> 16:44.503

16:44.570 --> 16:45.671
- OH, SORRY, TIMMY,

16:45.738 --> 16:47.740
WE CAN'T HELP YOU
WITHOUT OUR WANDS.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.975
- THEN I'LL HAVE TO HANDLE THIS
SOME OTHER WAY.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.277
WANDA, COME WITH ME.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.445
- WHOA!

16:53.512 --> 16:55.013
- COSMO, COME WITH ME.
- [screaming]

16:57.416 --> 17:00.486
- COSMO, WITHOUT MAGIC,
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.020
- TURN YOUR PARENTS INTO PUPPETS

17:02.087 --> 17:04.123
TO TRICK CROCKER INTO GIVING
BACK THAT PERMISSION SLIP?

17:04.189 --> 17:06.325
- WELL, I WAS GONNA
LOCK MR. CROCKER

17:06.392 --> 17:07.425
IN THE BASEMENT FOR LIFE,

17:07.492 --> 17:08.926
BUT LET'S GO WITH YOUR PLAN.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.339
[flushing noise]

17:21.406 --> 17:23.108
- AH, THANKS FOR LETTING ME
USE THE BATHROOM.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.810
F.Y.I., YOU MIGHT WANT TO
LIGHT A SCENTED CANDLE IN THERE.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.213
WELL, I'LL TAKE YOUR SON
AND HIS FAIRIES NOW

17:28.280 --> 17:29.314
AND BE ON MY WAY.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.417
- WAIT, CAPTAIN CROCKER.

17:31.483 --> 17:32.751
WE'VE CHANGED OUR MINDS

17:32.818 --> 17:34.987
ABOUT SENDING TIMMY
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.689
AND WE'D LIKE
OUR PERMISSION SLIP BACK.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.358
- WELL, AS THEY SAY IN THE ARMY,

17:39.425 --> 17:40.392
TOUGH TURKEYS!

17:40.459 --> 17:41.827

17:49.034 --> 17:50.035
THANKS FOR THE SUPER WEDGIE.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.470
