00:49.967 --> 00:53.803
Come on. Do it. You chicken?

00:55.347 --> 00:56.472
Do it!

01:03.564 --> 01:04.980
Come on, do it.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.483
Go on, hurry up!

01:13.532 --> 01:18.536
-Go on. Let's just do it, okay?
-Chicken or what?

01:20.748 --> 01:21.748
Do it.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.717
Run! Get out!

02:06.376 --> 02:07.627
Kid?

02:08.711 --> 02:19.472
Hey, kid?

02:23.519 --> 02:25.019
What happened?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.069
Help! Somebody, help!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.446
Somebody help!

02:41.245 --> 02:42.662
Help!

02:50.003 --> 02:52.547
Hold on now, you're going to be all right.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.507
We're almost there.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.217
Come on! Come on!

03:00.347 --> 03:02.682
-Hello, is this the Emergency Room?
-Yes, sir.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.685
-I'm bringing a child in!
-What is your emergency, sir?

03:05.769 --> 03:07.353
I don't know! I'm bringing a child in!

03:07.437 --> 03:08.855
Can you please state
the nature of your emergency?

03:11.233 --> 03:12.650
Help!

03:13.944 --> 03:15.319
Help him!

03:16.947 --> 03:19.448
Let's get a code package, stat!

03:19.950 --> 03:21.951
Prepare him for the burn unit.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.786
Careful, sir.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.414
It's okay now, sir. Put him in ER 3!

03:26.707 --> 03:28.666
You have to stay with me now.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.710
Are you the father?

03:30.794 --> 03:32.545
-Are you the boy's father?
-No, no.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.757
He was just in the middle of the road.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.676
He was walking down
the middle of the road.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.637
Have you seen him before?
What's his name?

03:42.890 --> 03:43.890
Sir?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.558
-What?
-Please, this is important.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.684
What?

03:46.768 --> 03:49.770
-His name? The boy's name?
-I don't know his name!

06:05.866 --> 06:07.867
Excuse me, Mr. Faraday?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.286
Yeah.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.329
We're Brady's parents.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.961
You feel like they're old enough.
They should be able to...

06:19.046 --> 06:21.839
You shouldn't let them out of your sight
for a moment.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.008
He said he was going to the park to play.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.719
He didn't want us to know
what he was doing.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.600
Michael, we can't thank you enough.
If you hadn't come along when you did...

06:32.684 --> 06:34.435
No, no. I'm just glad we made it.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.817
So, what...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.486
He and his friends

06:43.987 --> 06:47.364
got together all their fireworks,
their cones and their candles

06:47.574 --> 06:52.495
and tied them up together to blast
some kind of super-rocket out of the park.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.663
Brady is the one...

06:54.748 --> 06:57.333
He must have been the one that set it off.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.419
The other kids must've put him up to it.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.218
It was just starting to feel like home, too.

07:07.761 --> 07:12.473
I thought that to myself today.
Just thought, it's starting to feel like home.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.438
He's going to be okay.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.776
He will. He's going to be all right.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.030
Thank you, Michael.

07:33.370 --> 07:37.706
Oh, God.
It's got to be hell they're going through.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.920
Two months they've lived there.
I haven't said one word to them.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.675
You can't be best friends with everybody.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.761
I watch them fixing up their house,
their kids

07:51.054 --> 07:55.891
playing in the yard. I held their son
in my arms, hanging on for his life tonight.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.226
The kid

07:57.394 --> 08:00.938
lives right across the street.
I didn't even know his name.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.085
Did he die?

08:25.046 --> 08:27.381
No. He's gonna be all right.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.176
He's gonna be in the hospital for a while,
but he'll be fine.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.760
I saw the blood

08:32.554 --> 08:33.929
in the street.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.017
He's gonna be okay, Grant.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.813
Brooke said she made you dinner.
You're not hungry?

08:50.572 --> 08:52.740
You want me to fix you something?

08:56.369 --> 08:57.369
Grant.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.583
Is she gonna stay here every night?

09:03.460 --> 09:05.294
No, not every night. No.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.799
She stayed last night because I asked her.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.636
We talked about Brooke.
You said you liked her.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.638
I liked her better before.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.183
Yeah, well...

09:23.730 --> 09:25.648
Try to get some sleep, okay?

09:35.158 --> 09:36.325
Love you.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.888
The name of this course is
"American Terrorism."

09:58.556 --> 10:02.017
Two hundred years ago, we fought
a revolution in the name of certain beliefs,

10:02.102 --> 10:06.772
of liberty, of justice for all,
of self-rule and self-reliance.

10:07.315 --> 10:11.277
There are many in this country
who feel we have not yet won that war.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.114
Terrorist acts, violent political theater,

10:15.198 --> 10:18.409
these have been part of social dissent
in this country since its inception.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.620
But why? Why here, in this land of freedom?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.205
What's led men

10:23.373 --> 10:25.082
to such bloodshed

10:25.417 --> 10:27.167
in the name of their beliefs?

10:27.252 --> 10:30.087
Why in this era of national prosperity

10:30.171 --> 10:32.715
has the anti-government movement
been at its peak?

10:33.341 --> 10:36.719
And what's that going to mean
when the prosperity fades?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.513
Fewer and fewer of us are voting,

10:39.597 --> 10:42.224
more and more of us
are joining the ranks of a resistance.

10:42.350 --> 10:46.228
How long are we going to continue
to call these numbers insignificant?

10:47.772 --> 10:50.774
What do they have to teach us?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.546
-I'm gonna go explore.
-Okay.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.603
The only woman I ever liked having around
that was smarter than me.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.189
Whit Carver, generous to a fault.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.321
Hey there, Mr. Faraday.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.824
-How's he doing?
-He's all right.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.993
We're still seeing his counselor.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.580
She says he's improving,
but he still keeps to himself a lot.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.625
How's his dad doing?

11:51.503 --> 11:52.836
He's all right.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.839
Still seeing his graduate student?

11:57.717 --> 12:01.887
-She says he's improving, but...
-He still keeps to himself a lot?

12:05.016 --> 12:08.060
Man, Michael,
this kid they got me partnered with,

12:08.144 --> 12:12.481
he's a walking
laptop computer-cyberspace geek.

12:13.024 --> 12:16.276
Put him across from some real-life bad
guys, it's like he's surprised to see them.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.695
-I ought to make him take your course.
-Yeah?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.824
-Teaching it again, right?
-Oh, yeah.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.370
She'd like that.
I know what that'd mean to her.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.249
The invitation is still good, you know,
for you to come by as a guest.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.796
I'd rather not stand trial for you, Michael.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
That's not what it would be.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.342
Yeah, right. I know what it would be.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.348
How's work?

12:47.350 --> 12:48.851
You know, routine.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.398
That's what I miss, you know.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.484
The conversations about work.

12:57.610 --> 13:01.447
I'd tell her about my day,
and she couldn't tell me a goddamn thing.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.451
You wouldn't think I'd miss that, but I do.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.369
Have me to dinner sometime.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.164
I'll keep some state secrets from you,
make you feel like she never left.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.207
People remember her, Whit?

13:14.377 --> 13:16.420
-What do you mean?
-At the Bureau.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.881
Do they remember, or do people forget?

13:24.846 --> 13:27.097
They remember her, Michael, they do.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.854
Leah died for her country.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.608
She shouldn't have.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.744
Michael, hello. How are you doing?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.747
-Our other guest of honor. Come on in.
-Hope we're not late.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.499
No, no, no. Oliver, Michael's here!

13:53.666 --> 13:55.542
-Cheryl, this is Brooke. Brooke, Cheryl.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.836
-It's really nice to meet you, too.
-How are you?

13:58.171 --> 14:01.215
-Hi, I'm Brooke.
-This must be Grant. How are you doing?

14:01.925 --> 14:05.677
Listen, there's junk food in the kitchen,
just for kids and not for grown ups.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.723
-Come on in.
-Let me introduce you to some friends.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.143
-What are you gonna get?
-Hot dog, please.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.437
-Brady's looking great.
-Yeah.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.565
So would you, if you found a way
to get out of school for a while.

14:18.650 --> 14:22.945
You're right. I would.
I teach at GW, American History.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.490
I was always bad in history.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.909
Condemned to repeat it?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.494
Yes, several times.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.040
So what kind of work do you do?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.875
I'm a structural engineer.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.836
I work for a company...
You know the Reston Mall?

14:39.921 --> 14:42.047
-Oh, yeah.
-We are redesigning the addition.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.635
You want bigger stores, more parking?
I'm the guy to ask.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.722
He knows. I'm not sure
he totally understands what happened.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.516
You know Michael from?

14:53.309 --> 14:56.853
I was Michael's teaching assistant
in my first year of grad school.

14:56.938 --> 15:01.733
There was nothing between us back then.
I knew his family. I knew Leah.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.487
This thing is kind of,

15:07.824 --> 15:09.741
kind of new between us.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.454
Well, you're so sweet together.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.542
Well, of course, I think the world of him.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.296
He's such a good man

15:22.880 --> 15:24.506
such a good father.

15:34.267 --> 15:38.895
This job was just too appealing to pass up.
Contracts were down all over St. Louis.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.149
-How long were you in St. Louis?
-About four years thereabouts.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.278
I grew up on a farm
in a place called Carson, Kansas.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.448
I never lived east before.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.576
Kids will get to see their first ocean.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.455
-I'm afraid downtown is falling apart.
-That's what I hear.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.291
I guess we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.959
Hannah?

16:01.878 --> 16:03.128
Bedtime.

16:04.756 --> 16:05.797
Grant!

16:05.882 --> 16:08.467
-Be careful of his hand!
-I got two hands!

16:14.223 --> 16:18.602
It's been a long time since I've seen him
just being a kid. Sometimes, he...

16:18.895 --> 16:20.771
You know, since his mother...

16:23.232 --> 16:26.068
He has a tough time
making friends sometimes.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.158
Michael, we all need friends.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.244
Life just isn't the same without them.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.844
-Dad?
-Yeah.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.472
How do you spell "restricted"?

16:57.100 --> 17:00.602
Restricted. R-E-S-T-R-I...

17:00.853 --> 17:04.189
You know how to use the dictionary, Grant.
What are you guys doing in there?

17:04.482 --> 17:06.023
Building a compound.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.694
-A compound?
-A soldiers' compound.

17:11.823 --> 17:12.948
Stop, Dad.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.450
You have to know the secret handshake.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.703
Should we tell him?

17:20.289 --> 17:21.289
All right.

17:22.165 --> 17:26.002
Just so I know you're not going
to use any fireworks in there, Brady.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.671
General Brady, Dad.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.341
No fireworks, General Brady.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.469
That's classified information, Mr. Faraday.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.889
-You don't know the secret handshake.
-I'm serious, Brady.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.142
Come on, Grant.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.562
Get washed up guys.
We're going to get dinner on.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.120
Michael, hi. Come on in.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.664
I got something for you in my mailbox.

18:05.042 --> 18:09.129
-The University of Pennsylvania?
-I thought you hadn't lived east before.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.007
I haven't.
I went to Kansas State, Class of '78.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.884
They have me mixed up with someone else.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.845
-Same class?
-Yes, but at K-State.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.347
It's a reunion.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.185
Must have lost track of some guy
and sent it to me instead.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.563
Sorry about the mess. Cheryl and the girls
are at a church group tonight.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.732
I'm trying to catch up on a little work.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.817
-How are you?
-Good, good.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.736
-How's Grant?
-He's doing great.

18:32.862 --> 18:33.862
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.906
Excuse me a minute. Hello?

18:37.700 --> 18:39.034
Yeah, I can't really talk.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.372
Why don't I call you back?

18:46.751 --> 18:48.126
What do you mean?

18:49.587 --> 18:50.962
You're kidding?

18:54.091 --> 18:56.718
Well, we should really
talk in person about this. Yes.

19:01.224 --> 19:04.810
I can work on this tonight. Okay, all right.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.895
Listen, hold on a second.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.856
This project is taking forever
to get together.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.191
The client can't seem to make up his mind.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.194
-This the Reston Mall?
-Yeah, we're getting it on track.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.737
I'm sorry, I have to...

19:16.280 --> 19:17.906
We'll see each other this weekend?

19:17.990 --> 19:21.326
-Yes! The Junior D's.
-The thing Brady keeps talking about.

19:21.410 --> 19:25.247
He's gonna love it. He's gonna make more
friends than he'll know what to do with.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.041
-Yeah?
-They do campouts, they do trips.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.835
It'll give

19:30.586 --> 19:33.421
you the house to yourself
every now and then.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.757
You and Brooke, I mean.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.302
-Thank you, neighbor.
-For what?

19:39.470 --> 19:41.680
For having a 10-year old next door.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.022
What do you know about shopping malls?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.817
Shopping malls. I was over at the Langs'

19:54.443 --> 19:55.819
talking with Oliver.

19:55.945 --> 20:00.532
He had this blueprint on his counter.
He said it was the Reston Mall.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.660
-That's the one he's working on.
-Yeah. But it wasn't.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.955
-What do you mean, it wasn't?
-Well, I looked, Brooke.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.875
It was a building, it wasn't a mall.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.460
Right, it's an addition.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.841
No, it was an office building.
It wasn't stores at all.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.802
So it's some other project
that he's working on.

20:25.182 --> 20:28.977
Why would he tell me it was a mall
if it wasn't? Why would he lie?

20:31.480 --> 20:35.400
Michael, when you took engineering
in college, what kind of grades did you get?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.319
I didn't take engineering.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.536
What I saw was an office building.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.462
Fourteen months ago,
on a Monday in January

20:55.546 --> 20:58.673
over 60 federal employees went to work
like they always did

20:58.799 --> 21:02.177
at the Roosevelt Federal Building
in downtown St. Louis.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.181
Except on that Monday,
they didn't come home.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.850
In a truck parked in front

21:09.185 --> 21:12.812
was hidden 50 pounds
of C-4 plastic explosives.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.651
When it was detonated it disintegrated
the entire street side of the building

21:17.735 --> 21:21.029
obliterating dozens of government offices,

21:22.156 --> 21:24.366
the building's daycare center,

21:25.368 --> 21:28.954
and the St. Louis branch
of the Internal Revenue Service,

21:29.038 --> 21:32.624
which was ultimately determined
to be the target of the attack.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.586
The truck was leased
by this 33-year-old electrician.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.714
Dean Scobee.

21:40.675 --> 21:43.885
Scobee had served prison time
for tax evasion.

21:44.762 --> 21:48.390
And surveillance videos showed that
he was inside the vehicle,

21:48.474 --> 21:50.558
leaving him among the 63 dead.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.644
Does anyone not remember this?

21:55.606 --> 21:58.108
We all remember the results
of the investigation.

21:58.192 --> 22:03.113
-They said Scobee acted alone.
-One man. No conspirators. Right.

22:05.241 --> 22:09.077
He cheated the IRS.
They caught him at it, so he blew them up.

22:12.081 --> 22:16.209
This is a guy who people described
as average,

22:16.460 --> 22:17.919
friendly.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.132
He'd been in the army, but as a radio man.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.093
He had very little experience with munitions.

22:25.261 --> 22:28.763
His parents considered him
a moderate conservative.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.099
And two weeks prior to this,

22:31.767 --> 22:35.145
he received a pay raise
at his electrician's job!

22:35.271 --> 22:39.107
Does that sound like a man
who's on the edge or who needed a push?

22:41.277 --> 22:43.403
Come on. I don't know. I'm just asking.

22:43.487 --> 22:47.198
Come on, Professor.
The Feds, they did this huge investigation.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.243
That's right, an investigation. I forgot.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.873
Well, the investigation didn't satisfy me.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.586
Miss O'Neal, when you first heard the news,

22:59.670 --> 23:03.506
terrorist attack in your own country,
how did that make you feel?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.800
-Come on.
-Well...

23:07.595 --> 23:09.012
What did you feel?

23:09.472 --> 23:10.638
Angry,

23:11.974 --> 23:13.767
scared and stressed.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.603
-Did you feel safe?
-No.

23:17.688 --> 23:21.149
Then the next day,
when they found Scobee dead,

23:22.318 --> 23:25.987
did you feel some relief? Did safety return?

23:39.210 --> 23:42.003
The people in that building, they felt safe,

23:43.380 --> 23:44.672
secure.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.384
Just like you feel now.

23:50.638 --> 23:53.056
Then, an instant later,

23:55.351 --> 23:57.143
in an instant,

24:00.481 --> 24:02.649
they were gone forever.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.493
We needed to have this man to blame.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.666
We don't want others.

24:20.376 --> 24:24.087
We want one name and we want it fast

24:24.797 --> 24:28.258
because it gives us our security back.

24:31.554 --> 24:35.890
We can say, "Here was the one man,
unlike the rest of us.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.895
"We've named him, and he is no more.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.481
"And his reasons, they're gone, too."

24:44.191 --> 24:48.486
But the truth is, we don't know his reasons,
we don't know why Scobee did it.

24:48.571 --> 24:49.946
Why it came to this!

24:50.030 --> 24:54.284
We can pretend we do,
the $10,000 in taxes, but we don't know.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.829
And we'll never know.

25:00.916 --> 25:05.211
And still we feel safe

25:08.507 --> 25:10.758
because we know his name.

25:12.094 --> 25:15.555
-As God is my witness
-As God is my witness

25:16.682 --> 25:18.516
-I promise to give
-I promise to give

25:18.601 --> 25:22.353
-friendship to those in need,
-friendship to those in need,

25:22.438 --> 25:26.274
-help to those in trouble.
-help to those in trouble.

25:26.358 --> 25:30.945
-I will work with faith and honor
-I will work with faith and honor

25:31.030 --> 25:35.867
-to uphold the Discoverer Code,
-to uphold the Discoverer Code,

25:35.951 --> 25:39.162
-to respect myself,
-to respect myself,

25:39.246 --> 25:41.372
-my family
-my family

25:41.457 --> 25:44.042
-and my country.
-and my country.

25:44.126 --> 25:48.087
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Junior Discovery Troop 474.

26:03.479 --> 26:08.900
This is Oliver's study where he, you know,
gets away from the kids and me, I suppose.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.905
These are all projects you've worked on?

26:13.989 --> 26:18.868
I wish. No, I collect sketches, blueprints,
designs of old buildings.

26:18.953 --> 26:23.081
This is a front view of Monticello.
Down there is the Woolworth Building.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.249
It's his hobby.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.459
-The St. Louis Arch.
-Yes, correct.

26:27.878 --> 26:32.131
So, then all these drawings, these buildings,
they're not just for your job, then?

26:32.716 --> 26:33.716
No.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.011
So they're not all shopping malls.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.765
No, I don't know of any
architecturally significant shopping malls.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.559
Honey, you just haven't built them yet.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.107
-Who's hungry?
-I'm famished.

26:49.191 --> 26:53.319
Come on.
I've got some really delicious puff pastry.

26:56.156 --> 27:00.868
They work so hard when they're there.
You've gotta keep them in their seats.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.374
Politically, there's something
to be said for that, I think.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.542
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.878
Here we are leaving the church.
Everyone thought we were going to Mexico.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.088
Where were you going?

27:12.172 --> 27:15.758
We were going there,
but the plane never left the ground.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.385
Some engine trouble.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.638
We couldn't leave till morning, so we
wound up spending our wedding night

27:20.723 --> 27:22.724
at the Wichita Airport Motel.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.309
How romantic.

27:24.685 --> 27:26.769
For $1 9, it was wonderful.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.063
How long have you two been married?

27:29.481 --> 27:30.940
Twelve years in August.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.192
...what kind of example
is that for everybody else?

27:33.736 --> 27:35.903
I don't think

27:36.989 --> 27:40.992
we learn responsibility from politicians.
We really learn it from family.

27:42.036 --> 27:45.413
It's the people that we care about.
It's what they care about. That's where...

27:45.497 --> 27:48.124
My dad, he died when I was a teenager.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.919
-I'm sorry.
-Farm accident.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.757
My father, mostly.
Who would you say you get yours from?

27:55.841 --> 27:57.592
My what? My values?

28:02.264 --> 28:04.098
Probably from my wife.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.768
Values? What values?

28:07.353 --> 28:10.855
Well, Michael and I were talking about
where you get your values from

28:10.939 --> 28:13.858
and we were both saying
it's mostly from family.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.528
Where else are you gonna get them?
Celebrities? Politicians?

28:17.613 --> 28:19.364
Not in this century.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.203
I just think it's a sorry state of affairs

28:25.287 --> 28:28.039
when you can't find a role model
to cast your vote for.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.792
It's not even role models, necessarily,

28:30.876 --> 28:35.630
it's just people who acknowledge
the consequences of their actions.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.507
Or pay for those actions.

28:37.591 --> 28:41.135
I think we should put
some of these politicians in jail.

28:41.512 --> 28:46.140
Oliver, you can't ask government
to be infallible. You just can't.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.975
But you can ask it to be accountable.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.814
I can ask it to be honest.

28:53.148 --> 28:57.235
You know, when Leah died all I wanted

28:58.028 --> 29:00.405
was someone to tell me,

29:01.448 --> 29:03.199
"We made a mistake." You know?

29:04.368 --> 29:08.663
"We made a mistake,
your wife suffered for it,

29:09.873 --> 29:12.750
"and we'd take it back 100 times
if we could."

29:15.337 --> 29:17.296
But they don't say that.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.340
She would've.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.849
Some of them knew her.

29:32.855 --> 29:36.315
They work so hard at being able
to look you in the eye.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.503
Excuse me.

30:10.893 --> 30:12.977
Leave him alone. He's fine.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.274
Sorry.

30:19.943 --> 30:20.985
It's okay.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.451
I see how much you miss her.

30:28.535 --> 30:29.827
There are just times, you know,

30:29.912 --> 30:33.956
when you realize how much of your own life
is out of your hands.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.878
What are you gonna do?

30:43.091 --> 30:45.176
I guess you can have faith.

30:47.930 --> 30:51.098
Try to make a difference
where you can with Grant,

30:53.101 --> 30:54.894
with your classes.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.108
What about you?

31:04.530 --> 31:06.280
I've got my family.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.826
And the buildings I leave behind.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.457
That's it.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.669
Get your shoulder up a little bit, okay?

31:19.753 --> 31:22.713
Step into it.
Watch that ball until it hits the bat.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.007
-That's it, that's it!
-Brady?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.803
You want some Cracker Jack?

31:33.016 --> 31:36.769
You sure? Popcorn and caramel,
it builds your muscles.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.146
All right.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.984
Hey, atta way, Faraday.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.654
He's getting confidence up there.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.406
He's a strong kid.

31:50.367 --> 31:53.995
-He's been dealt some hard breaks.
-Way to swing.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.331
You give him strength, Michael.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.875
-I'm trying.
-You do.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.839
Getting on with your life.
That's important for him to see.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.010
He just wishes someone had to pay.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.512
What?

32:12.639 --> 32:16.434
For his mother,
he just wishes someone had to pay.

32:17.019 --> 32:19.186
He's talked to you about her?

32:20.188 --> 32:22.440
Her people send her in
with the wrong information

32:22.524 --> 32:24.525
and then say, "Hey, not my fault."

32:26.778 --> 32:28.738
I can't live with that.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.199
Or you, let alone a 9-year-old boy.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.370
Grant talked to you about his mother?

32:38.373 --> 32:39.540
Well, yeah.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.419
I hope that's all right.
We talk about a lot of things.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.839
He's a smart kid.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.552
Way to go, Grant.

32:54.765 --> 32:57.433
Never more wise than when we're children.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.560
They say it and it's true.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.898
We'll never see things that clear again.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.905
Let me have a hit.

33:17.454 --> 33:20.331
Grant? Grant?

33:22.876 --> 33:26.295
Grant, come on, now, it's dinnertime!
Wash your hands!

33:26.380 --> 33:29.757
-I'm eating with Brady!
-No. Come on, now.

33:30.467 --> 33:34.345
Michael, I'm sorry. Brady invited him over
for dinner. I thought he'd asked you.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.472
Can I eat with Brady, Dad?

33:41.436 --> 33:45.064
Okay, if his dad says it's all right.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.358
Is it all right, kids?

33:51.071 --> 33:52.863
I can fly!

34:10.257 --> 34:13.717
-Good afternoon. U. Penn.
-Transcript office, please.

34:13.802 --> 34:14.802
Transcripts.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.304
Yeah, hi. I'm calling
from George Washington University.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.516
We have a student who's applying for
graduate work in our history department

34:21.601 --> 34:25.146
and I need to verify
his undergrad record with you guys.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.482
He's been out of school for some time.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.777
The name is Oliver Lang.

34:33.655 --> 34:36.407
Are you telling me you took this
out of his mailbox? That is illegal.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.868
Just tell me you don't think
this sounds strange.

34:38.952 --> 34:43.371
The University of Pennsylvania keeps
sending alumni stuff for a 20-year reunion.

34:43.456 --> 34:47.293
He says he went to Kansas State. They have
him mixed up with some other Oliver Lang.

34:47.377 --> 34:50.379
So, I called Penn,
I get that guy's transcripts.

34:50.464 --> 34:53.882
-What? Why? Michael...
-Brooke, listen to me.

34:53.967 --> 34:57.344
That guy has a completely different
physical description.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.680
He never took a class in engineering.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.433
Right, honey, because they've got him
mixed up with somebody else.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.603
Brooke, this U. Penn "Oliver"
is the same age as Oliver.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.981
-Wait. As our...
-As our Oliver. Yes!

35:09.065 --> 35:13.861
He graduated the same year
and he comes from Carson, Kansas.

35:14.738 --> 35:15.905
Oliver's hometown.

35:15.989 --> 35:20.034
Wait, I'm totally lost here.
You just said they are two different people.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.746
Two people of the same age
from the same small town.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.290
I looked it up. It's a small town!

35:26.416 --> 35:28.417
Yeah. So what?

35:28.835 --> 35:32.588
Brooke, don't you think they would've heard
of each other, these guys, growing up?

35:32.672 --> 35:34.131
Gotten mixed up before?

35:34.216 --> 35:37.676
Oliver didn't say anything like that.
He just threw the letter away.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.470
-So... So...
-Wait a minute.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.139
There could be 10 other Michael Faradays
in Northern Virginia

35:42.224 --> 35:45.476
-and you would never know that.
-So, I called Kansas State.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.144
Here's what I'm saying,

35:47.229 --> 35:52.107
Kansas State University had no Oliver Lang
on record from that year or any year.

35:52.192 --> 35:56.779
So, either he didn't really go to that school
or that is not his real name.

35:58.031 --> 35:59.615
Can I ask you something?

35:59.699 --> 36:01.826
Did you do this to me
when we started dating?

36:01.910 --> 36:03.661
-What?
-Call up my ex-boyfriends,

36:03.745 --> 36:05.621
get my transcripts sent over?

36:05.705 --> 36:08.207
You got to admit
there is something not right here.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.585
No, this isn't right.
You have invaded his privacy.

36:11.962 --> 36:15.005
So maybe he lied about
where he went to college. Big deal.

36:15.090 --> 36:19.093
People lie about things all the time.
It doesn't give you the right to spy on them.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.636
God, you of all people.

36:22.556 --> 36:25.599
I mean, are you teaching the Bill of Rights
this semester

36:25.684 --> 36:27.768
or did that not make the program?

36:30.605 --> 36:34.441
I don't know what you're doing.
We've made some friends here.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.278
All right?

36:39.281 --> 36:41.115
I'll see you tonight.

37:01.761 --> 37:02.887
Lang.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.221
Shit.

38:02.739 --> 38:03.948
"Fenimore."

38:05.951 --> 38:08.452
'Cause you've never been
away from home before, Grant!

38:08.536 --> 38:11.246
-You're nine years old!
-Nine and a half!

38:11.373 --> 38:14.833
-There'll be grown-ups there! Lots.
-The answer is no, Grant!

38:15.043 --> 38:16.877
It's spring vacation. You said I could go.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.005
Well, now I'm saying
that you can't go, Grant!

38:23.510 --> 38:26.971
You know, look, maybe you can go
for summer camp or something, okay?

38:27.055 --> 38:28.055
Brady's going!

38:28.139 --> 38:31.016
Brady might not be the best kid
for you to be alone in the woods with!

38:31.101 --> 38:33.018
-Dad.
-The answer is no!

38:33.395 --> 38:35.187
He's my best friend.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.444
Grant, look, you want to go to camp so bad,

38:42.529 --> 38:45.948
we'll go to
Aunt Ruth's and Uncle Rob's cabin, okay?

38:46.032 --> 38:48.409
-That's a lie.
-No, it's not.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.912
-You'll be too busy! You'll forget!
-Maybe just you and me.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.415
You'll forget you said I could go!

39:07.345 --> 39:09.430
-Come here.
-He lied to me.

39:16.104 --> 39:21.859
The FBI keeps a file on every American
who has ever been charged with a crime.

39:21.943 --> 39:26.447
Now, certain offenses
cause files to be flagged.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.615
Two years ago, these flags,

39:28.992 --> 39:33.287
they picked up a series of suspicious
firearms purchases in Maryland,

39:33.371 --> 39:35.330
Georgia and the Carolinas.

39:35.457 --> 39:39.835
There were 100 guns from assault rifles,
army-issues

39:42.839 --> 39:46.383
all bought by acquaintances
of Seaver Parsons.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.804
Husband, father of three,
amateur gun-collector,

39:51.514 --> 39:56.143
an outspoken member of the right-wing
extremists here in West Virginia.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.229
To the FBI, it appeared that Parsons

39:59.314 --> 40:02.483
was stockpiling weapons
for some sort of offensive.

40:03.693 --> 40:09.406
So, they sent four FBI agents
with a search warrant here

40:10.909 --> 40:16.663
thinking that they would uncover some sort
of treasure chest of felony firearms.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.750
Munitions for war.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.419
Seven-November, we got you eyeballed.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.052
Backup's en route.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.139
How're you gonna handle this, Boss?

40:34.224 --> 40:35.724
The easy way.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.893
Yeah. I heard that.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.191
Hey, there, mister.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.653
You catch yourself some dinner?

40:50.865 --> 40:53.700
Is that your house over there?

40:57.038 --> 40:59.748
Do you know if your father is home, son?

41:00.458 --> 41:01.917
He don't know you.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.545
No, son, we're from Washington.

41:04.629 --> 41:09.258
Here at this fence line, they encountered
Parsons' youngest son, age 10.

41:10.552 --> 41:13.971
They asked him where his father was,
but they neglected,

41:14.055 --> 41:18.350
failed to first identify themselves
as federal agents.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.854
Why don't you run on up
and ask your daddy to come outside

41:21.938 --> 41:26.024
because there's some people out here
that would like to speak to him. Okay?

41:33.032 --> 41:36.285
-Cover the house.
-No, stay here! The backup is coming.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.956
The kid doesn't know why we're here!

41:42.083 --> 41:44.084
They're here! They're here! They're coming!

41:44.419 --> 41:45.460
Jeb, they're coming!

41:45.545 --> 41:48.422
-Get back, he's just a kid!
-They're here! They're here!

42:01.895 --> 42:04.521
Cease fire! Cease fire!

42:18.036 --> 42:19.119
Ma!

42:54.489 --> 42:55.489
Just hold on.

42:58.701 --> 43:01.495
Pinned down, they returned fire.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.999
And finally, the reinforcements arrived.

43:08.169 --> 43:11.672
When it was over,
the siege lasted over two hours.

43:15.677 --> 43:20.138
At the end, Parsons'
two eldest sons were wounded.

43:21.641 --> 43:24.685
His wife and his youngest boy were killed.

43:26.479 --> 43:28.188
And as for Parsons,

43:30.358 --> 43:32.109
he wasn't even home.

44:18.906 --> 44:22.284
See, the FBI, they thought

44:23.995 --> 44:28.915
that their people were uncovering
some sort of terrorist plot, you see?

44:29.417 --> 44:34.129
But what their file,
their flags, did not reveal to them

44:36.215 --> 44:40.886
was that Seaver Parsons had come
into a family inheritance

44:40.970 --> 44:44.014
with which he had arranged
the 100 legal firearms

44:44.098 --> 44:46.141
to be legally purchased!

44:46.225 --> 44:48.435
Nor did it tell them that Parsons

44:48.561 --> 44:51.355
had recently applied for a sales license.

44:52.774 --> 44:54.358
Nor did it tell them

44:54.442 --> 45:00.614
that Parsons warned his family that some
people might want to steal his collection!

45:01.741 --> 45:07.371
And he instructed his sons and his wife
and his daughter-in-law

45:08.873 --> 45:13.043
never to let strangers on this property
while he was away.

45:13.127 --> 45:18.673
And if force be taken
then to defend with force! Defend the home!

45:22.512 --> 45:25.722
You know,
he had no love for the federal government.

45:25.807 --> 45:29.476
He did have a separatist
and a suspicious past.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.896
But this was not a terrorist.
He was not a criminal.

45:33.981 --> 45:39.611
And three innocent people died that day
because the flags went up.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.617
And the flags were wrong.

46:04.887 --> 46:07.097
Don't just dive in.
I want you to think for yourself.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.390
-I want you to be safe.
-Let go of my hand!

46:08.474 --> 46:10.434
All right. Okay, okay. Look.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.770
I want you to have a great time, okay?

46:15.022 --> 46:17.190
And listen to your Troopmaster, all right?

46:17.275 --> 46:19.609
Did Brooke tell you to let me go?

46:19.694 --> 46:21.862
Yes, she did, as a matter of fact.

46:21.946 --> 46:26.283
She said that you're a big guy and you can
handle 10 days away. She's right.

46:26.367 --> 46:27.909
When I get back

46:30.705 --> 46:32.164
is she going to take Mom's place?

46:34.375 --> 46:36.918
Nobody is ever going to
take your mom's place.

46:37.003 --> 46:41.548
Not Brooke. Nobody.
Mom is always going to be with us.

46:42.383 --> 46:43.675
Right here.

46:45.052 --> 46:48.889
Because we remember her
like nothing could ever take her away.

46:50.057 --> 46:54.269
If Brooke and I ever start thinking
about something like that

46:54.353 --> 46:56.646
we're going to talk to you about it first.

46:56.731 --> 47:00.317
She'll only ever live with us
if Mom says it's okay, too.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.945
Okay.

47:05.615 --> 47:06.990
You have a great time.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.575
Thanks for camp, Dad.

47:09.410 --> 47:11.912
You have a good one. All right.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.498
-Thanks, Dad. See you!
-See you later!

47:28.554 --> 47:31.181
His name was William Fenimore

47:31.265 --> 47:34.476
and I'm told he changed it to Oliver Lang.

47:34.852 --> 47:37.270
It may take me a few moments, sir.

47:46.614 --> 47:52.369
Okay, we do have a William Fenimore of
Carson, Kansas changed to an Oliver Lang.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.121
Do you know when that was?

47:55.540 --> 47:57.624
October 5, 1981 .

47:58.251 --> 48:01.545
Thank you very much,
that's exactly what I was looking for.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.056
State of Kansas, Department of Records.

48:13.140 --> 48:17.435
Yes, hi. Michael Jones.
I'm with the E.E.O.C. in Washington.

48:17.812 --> 48:21.940
I've got a possible name change
I wanted to run by you guys.

48:22.900 --> 48:26.653
I'm looking for an Oliver Lang.
He's out of Carson, Kansas.

48:26.737 --> 48:28.196
Hold on, sir.

48:32.493 --> 48:35.078
Sir, I'm afraid we've got nothing
on any name change

48:35.162 --> 48:37.247
for an Oliver Lang of Carson, Kansas.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.583
Okay. Just doing my job. Thank you.

48:39.667 --> 48:44.838
Sir, our records indicate Oliver Lang
deceased as of October 4, 1981 .

48:44.922 --> 48:46.923
-October 4th?
-Yes, sir.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.137
The 4th.

48:54.181 --> 48:58.143
What does it say?
The death certificate, what does it say?

48:58.811 --> 49:02.522
Cause of death is listed as gunshot.
Hunting accident.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.776
You had said you were calling
with whom in Washington?

49:06.861 --> 49:08.153
Thank you.

49:14.702 --> 49:15.660
Just run through the scenario with me.

49:15.745 --> 49:18.538
Theoretically, why would someone do that?

49:18.789 --> 49:22.208
Do what? Change his name to the name
of the person who died the day before?

49:22.293 --> 49:26.630
Yeah. Someone the same age,
from the same hometown. Why?

49:26.714 --> 49:29.633
Would it be to take over that person's life?

49:29.717 --> 49:31.468
No, that wouldn't work.

49:31.552 --> 49:34.471
See, when you die, the death certificate
goes above state and federal.

49:34.555 --> 49:37.891
Driver's licenses,
Social Security numbers, they're voided.

49:38.768 --> 49:40.644
You couldn't do it
to hide the person you are.

49:40.728 --> 49:42.437
Then why would you do it?

49:42.647 --> 49:45.065
You do it to hide the person you were.

49:45.900 --> 49:50.779
Say you wanted to find out a criminal record
for your guy prior to the name change.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.656
Unless you're a real professional...

49:52.740 --> 49:55.158
I see, you'd check on the name he has now.

49:55.242 --> 49:58.453
And the records you'd find back then
would be for somebody else entirely.

49:58.537 --> 50:02.374
That's the significance of making
the change right after a person's death.

50:02.458 --> 50:03.625
No overlap.

50:05.086 --> 50:08.880
-It gives you a whole new history.
-It helps the old one disappear.

50:11.884 --> 50:14.719
Is there something you want
to tell me, Michael?

50:15.888 --> 50:19.766
Whit, if I give you a name,
could you run it for flags?

50:20.142 --> 50:22.143
Jesus, Michael.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.186
Just this once.

50:23.270 --> 50:26.189
Check out files as a personal favor?
That's what you're asking me to do?

50:26.273 --> 50:27.357
Come on, I'm not...

50:27.441 --> 50:30.026
-You don't get fired for that. You go to jail.
-Whit, this is important!

50:30.111 --> 50:32.112
-My pension is important!
-Whit!

50:32.947 --> 50:34.698
I'm asking you to run a name.

50:34.782 --> 50:38.368
I'm not asking you to start surveillance
and break out the goddamn guns!

50:38.452 --> 50:42.330
Faraday, if you'd asked your wife to do it,
she'd tell you the same thing.

50:42.415 --> 50:44.916
Get you classified FBI information?
She'd say,

50:45.000 --> 50:48.628
"I love you, baby, but that I cannot do."

50:50.506 --> 50:54.759
Michael, if you want to find out about
somebody, there's always ways to do it.

50:55.261 --> 50:58.847
But just not through me.
Come on, use your imagination.

51:11.819 --> 51:13.737
Hi, Daphne. How are you doing?

51:15.990 --> 51:17.365
You doing okay?

51:21.328 --> 51:22.495
Hi, Hannah.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.123
Mommy and Daddy aren't home.

51:25.207 --> 51:29.252
Well, you know... You know what...
Actually, I don't need your mom and dad.

51:29.336 --> 51:33.173
You know what,
I locked myself out of my house.

51:33.299 --> 51:34.758
I came home from work and realized...

51:34.842 --> 51:36.634
We can't let strangers in.

51:37.678 --> 51:39.888
Well, I'm not a stranger. Right?

51:42.975 --> 51:46.519
See, what I need to do is use your phone

51:47.855 --> 51:52.484
to call up somebody
to see if they'll help me get in the house.

51:52.985 --> 51:57.989
Would that be all right, if I use your phone?

52:00.034 --> 52:01.201
Kitchen.

52:01.869 --> 52:02.869
Good.

52:06.332 --> 52:08.917
You know what, I'm gonna use the phone
in your dad's study.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.126
You guys are playing here.

52:10.211 --> 52:11.503
That's Dad's study!

52:11.587 --> 52:16.299
I'll just be a sec. You guys go ahead
and play. Your dad won't mind.

52:28.354 --> 52:33.566
Well, yes, I got a home lockout.

52:35.027 --> 52:37.403
I need your help to get back in.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.406
Faraday, Michael.

52:44.245 --> 52:48.414
2505 Arlington Road in Reston.

52:49.375 --> 52:51.835
No, no, that's no problem.

52:51.919 --> 52:54.796
Yes, I have identification.

53:58.986 --> 54:00.361
Michael!

54:02.156 --> 54:03.698
You locked yourself out?

54:03.782 --> 54:08.077
You scared the shit out of me.
I was on the phone

54:08.162 --> 54:11.122
and the picture was falling.
It was crooked, so I...

54:14.084 --> 54:15.793
Yeah, the locksmith guy is coming.

54:15.878 --> 54:19.213
Good. Good. Did you want to wait here?
I'm just back from the store.

54:19.298 --> 54:21.049
No, thanks.

54:21.300 --> 54:26.137
I got a call from Brady today.
He and Grant are having a wonderful time.

54:26.221 --> 54:29.307
He went on and on and on
about what kind of bugs they're catching.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.601
I don't know if there's any kind
of badge for that.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.978
Can I offer you something?

54:34.063 --> 54:40.360
No, I should really get back to some papers
that I can grade while I wait.

54:40.444 --> 54:44.781
-But, thank you for the call.
-Sure.

54:45.699 --> 54:47.075
Thank you, girls.

54:48.243 --> 54:50.119
Our house is your house.

54:56.043 --> 54:59.170
Michael, just a sec. You forgot your case.

55:01.006 --> 55:02.548
And your phone.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.762
Need to recharge my batteries.

55:07.972 --> 55:09.597
I know the feeling.

55:21.485 --> 55:24.904
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Pretending to wait for a locksmith.

55:25.572 --> 55:27.907
-Why?
-I pretended to be locked out.

55:29.868 --> 55:33.162
-Why was that again?
-I'll explain it to you.

55:33.622 --> 55:35.915
Can we pretend to have dinner first?

56:11.577 --> 56:13.036
Hi, neighbor.

56:42.566 --> 56:43.649
"Pipe bomb."

56:51.533 --> 56:53.367
"Sources say the agency...

56:56.580 --> 56:58.581
"William Fenimore, senior..."

56:59.208 --> 57:00.917
How's the hunting?

57:04.129 --> 57:05.338
Hey, Oliver.

57:08.509 --> 57:12.678
I was in the city on a project,
went by your office, they said check here.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.723
-Got some research going?
-Yes, '70s.

57:19.186 --> 57:21.395
-Is that the Kansas City Star?
-Yeah.

57:21.480 --> 57:25.066
-That's the paper I read growing up.
-It's for a lecture course.

57:25.150 --> 57:29.737
I got a class that deals
with extremist groups.

57:33.909 --> 57:36.702
American History,
background on state militias.

57:37.121 --> 57:38.996
There's one in Kansas.

57:39.957 --> 57:42.125
It seems they got one everywhere.

57:42.709 --> 57:45.503
Jeez, I didn't know you taught a course
in terrorism.

57:45.587 --> 57:48.131
-That's a pretty frightening subject.
-Yeah.

57:52.010 --> 57:53.302
Got time for a drink?

57:53.387 --> 57:56.097
No. No. Today's not good.

57:57.141 --> 57:58.975
Yeah, I hear you. I got a building contract.

57:59.059 --> 58:02.061
It's kicking my butt trying to put it together.

58:02.271 --> 58:07.150
Hey, listen, get back to work. I'm sorry to
drop by. Catch you back at the ranch.

58:07.526 --> 58:08.901
Good to see you.

58:12.447 --> 58:15.324
Will you just hear me out?
Hear what I am saying.

58:16.326 --> 58:19.245
The guy changed his name, Brooke. Why?

58:20.330 --> 58:23.833
To help hide his background. Why?
Because there's something in it!

58:23.917 --> 58:25.835
Yeah. Something that's not your business,
Michael.

58:25.919 --> 58:30.339
Brooke, when he was 1 6 years old, he tried
to blow up some offices. Read the paper.

58:31.091 --> 58:34.177
A government agency
that was cheating his father's farm.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.762
He served time in a juvenile program.

58:38.265 --> 58:39.932
Pipe bomb. As a kid.

58:40.684 --> 58:45.688
Why would you go to these lengths
to hide that part of your history?

58:46.982 --> 58:51.194
If it wasn't an isolated event. If you thought
you might try it again someday.

58:51.278 --> 58:54.447
Michael, this says, it didn't even go off.
He was a kid!

58:54.531 --> 58:57.700
Brooke, Brady practically killed himself
with a bunch of fireworks.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.785
What, in March? Come on!

59:00.454 --> 59:03.873
Where do you think that comes from?
Where does Brady get an idea like that?

59:03.957 --> 59:05.374
What are you saying?

59:05.459 --> 59:09.879
I'm saying that he's going
to these great lengths to hide his past.

59:10.297 --> 59:14.050
I'm saying that he was in St. Louis
when the Federal building was bombed.

59:14.134 --> 59:17.887
And I'm saying, Brooke,
that there is a blueprint in his house

59:18.138 --> 59:20.389
that he does not want me to see.

59:24.478 --> 59:27.104
-Are you listening to yourself?
-Are you listening to me?

59:27.189 --> 59:28.940
-Are you listening to me?
-Your neighbor...

59:29.024 --> 59:32.068
-Yes.
-...is a terrorist.

59:32.152 --> 59:34.987
-Brooke. Brooke!
-He has been blowing up buildings.

59:35.072 --> 59:38.658
There's something going on over there!
Something is being planned!

59:38.742 --> 59:40.284
Something is being planned? Yeah.

59:40.369 --> 59:44.455
And, you know, in his spare time, he pays
the mortgage and takes his kid to camp

59:44.539 --> 59:47.458
-and takes his daughters to ballet class.
-Brooke, that house is not normal.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.502
That house is normal, Michael.

59:49.670 --> 59:51.963
Brooke, do you remember when
we were over there the other night?

59:52.047 --> 59:54.298
-Him discussing politics with us?
-Yeah, we disagree about politics.

59:54.383 --> 59:56.926
And Washington? And Leah?

59:58.220 --> 59:59.595
Do you remember this?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.682
-Brooke, the guy is testing me.
-You're the one who brought up Leah.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.601
Brooke, he wants to see
if I'm an enemy or an ally!

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:10.106
Michael, you are the one
who brought up Leah.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:12.942
Is that what this is about?

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.611
No, it's not about Leah.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.245
This class that you slave over,

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.749
you know, to carry on Leah's work,
to have something in her memory.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:38.759
You know, these plots and conspiracies
and red flags going up!

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.430
Yeah, yeah. This is Leah's world, you know.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.484
I can't.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:01.282
Listen, I know that

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.036
he's changed his name.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.038
-Michael, Michael. Stop it, for me.
-He lived in St. Louis

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.749
-when the bombs were going off.
-For me.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:13.544
And he's working on this building
that he doesn't want me to see.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.760
I don't think I can stay here tonight.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:23.012
I'm not staying.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.225
Brooke.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:40.005
I never did like that picture.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:47.221
You know me, Michael?
You think you know me?

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:52.810
Yeah, you know me better
than I know myself, don't you?

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.355
The Kansas City Star. I saw you.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:59.859
You want to tell me something
I don't know?

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.735
I know what I read.

01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:03.863
You know a 1 6-year-old kid.

01:03:05.866 --> 01:03:09.577
You don't know me. You know a kid at 1 6.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:14.457
Damn you!

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:16.459
You've been a guest in my house!

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:18.878
You're a guest in mine, Fenimore.

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.131
Bill, Will. William? What do I call you?

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.884
Who the hell do you think you are,
judging me?

01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:27.344
What gives you the right?

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.224
You ever worked on a farm, Michael?

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:39.857
To make your living? Support your family?

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:46.197
The government stole my father's water.
The stream that ran through our land.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.783
They said they were appropriating it
for other uses.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:54.538
We couldn't grow crops,
we couldn't raise cattle.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.917
We had loans we couldn't pay.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:02.671
My father woke up one morning

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:05.799
and he realized he was worth more
dead than alive.

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:13.599
His skin and bones were worth more
in insurance money than as a damn farmer.

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:22.274
I found his tractor at the bottom
of the bluffs behind our house.

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:25.819
He made it look like an accident.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:29.490
I found his body. And the note.

01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:34.620
He wrote it to me.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:45.756
The insurance money paid off
what Mom could but it wasn't enough.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:50.844
The neighbors took our land at auction.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:56.517
All because some bureaucrat
stuck a pin in a map.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:02.064
Some creek in the middle of Kansas.
Said we couldn't use our own water.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:05.526
-Didn't give you the right to build a bomb.
-I was 1 6!

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:10.322
Sixteen! You ever do anything wrong
when you were 1 6?

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:14.159
You ever crash your car?

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:19.415
You ever steal anything?
You ever screw the wrong girl?

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.626
You're gonna tell your kid everything
you did when you were 1 6, Michael?

01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:25.337
The lies you told, the drugs you took?

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:30.884
I've been judged for this.
I got sent away for it.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:35.431
You know what, it was the best thing that
ever could've happened to me. Best thing.

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:43.856
Who is Oliver?

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.867
He was my best friend growing up.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:59.872
He died when we were both 25.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:05.044
I did it to honor him,

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:08.714
to carry on his name.

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:15.596
And to hide. Yeah, to hide.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:21.727
Because I didn't want any son I had
knowing what I did.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:26.523
'Cause I didn't want my kids to be burdened

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:30.736
with people looking through
old newspapers.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:34.573
I'm not proud of this.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.161
This isn't pride.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:44.750
I wish it never happened.

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:48.754
You know, I wish to God

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:55.260
that my family could have
my father's good name.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:04.645
You know, you have a right to know
who lives next door.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.441
Who talks to your kid,
who considers himself your friend.

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:13.112
But you also have the right...

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:17.783
If you have a problem with me,
if you have issues with me,

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:24.498
you could have the decency to walk
across the street and tell me to my face.

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:14.757
Oliver!

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.916
Hi, this is Michael. Leave a message.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:40.504
Michael, it's me. Listen, I think you're right.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:45.509
I saw Oliver at the mall in the garage

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:48.220
and he switched cars with somebody

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:52.391
and I followed him
to this warehouse delivery place

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:58.188
and they were unloading
these long metal boxes.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:04.236
I want to talk to you. I'm coming over, okay?

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:11.910
Cheryl.

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:13.078
Brooke.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.038
I knew it was you.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:18.083
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.380
What are you doing here?

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:29.928
Just shopping. What are you doing here?

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:33.932
Shopping.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.729
Great.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:41.231
Yeah.

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:04.212
They say a man was shot several times
while driving along 19th Street.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:08.258
His out-of-control car struck several
other vehicles before slamming into a tree.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.552
The victim was pronounced dead
at the scene.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.055
Elsewhere, a single car accident
near Reston

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:16.391
is tying up evening traffic
on westbound Route 7 at this hour.

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:20.437
Details are sketchy at this point.
What we can tell from our overhead shot

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:23.899
is the accident took place
near the Pine Glen Outlet Center.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:28.361
No other vehicles appeared to be involved
in what police say is a fatal crash.

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:32.491
We'll have more information for you
when it becomes available.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:36.870
The driver of the car, described
as a woman in her mid-20s,

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:38.872
has been pronounced dead at the scene.

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:42.375
Police say it appears she lost control
of her light blue 1989 Mustang

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.087
and crashed through a guard rail
along the ravine.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:48.006
Investigators believe she was killed
upon impact...

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.654
Sir, you can't go down there!

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:13.990
Sir, you can't come down here!
You can't go down there.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:17.869
-Where is she? Where is she?
-We've got to keep this area clear, sir.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:21.039
-She's gone, sir. She's been taken away.
-Where?

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.125
Where?

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.252
-She's gone.
-Where?

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.545
I'm sorry.

01:14:29.549 --> 01:14:35.220
No.

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:10.672
Hey, General, how you holding up?

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:13.133
Dad, we gotta go camping. It's so cool!

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:16.970
We went swimming and climbing.
And one night, there was a lightning storm.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.722
We had to stay in a motel!

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:19.848
You did?

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:23.185
I learned how to make shelters
and campfires, and there's knots and knives.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:25.270
And me and Brady can tell animal tracks.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.938
That's terrific.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:29.649
Dad, I have to go.
The Troopmaster is calling us.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:31.359
We're doing a cave hike.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:34.321
Okay, Grant, I'll see you in a couple of days.
I love you.

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:35.906
Dad, I've got to go!

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:48.919
It's better to tell him when he gets back.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.803
Thanks for coming to get me.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.890
Michael, if there's anything you need...

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.059
-No.
-...we're here.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.228
No, I won't.

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:08.647
I'll be fine, it's just...

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:12.234
Don't let yourself...

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:16.279
I mean, sometimes it's better not to be alone
when you don't have to be.

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:20.784
She was a good person, Michael. Kind.

01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:23.161
A kind girl.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:27.457
If I haven't been myself
these past few weeks,

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:33.838
-I'm sorry for everything.
-Michael, Michael.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:38.677
She liked you, your family very much.

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:46.851
We're here for you. We really are.

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:22.053
-Hello.
-Michael, it's Whit.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:24.222
How you doing?
I haven't heard back from you, man.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:30.937
Whit, my girlfriend, Brooke,
was killed Friday.

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:34.649
-God, Michael, no.
-Yeah.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.486
Can I talk to you later?

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:41.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Whenever.
I'm here at the office.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.825
Thanks.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.801
Agent Carver.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:02.927
Whit?

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:06.848
What did you mean,
you haven't heard back from me?

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:10.060
The message I left on Friday.
I understand now.

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:12.937
-It's all right.
-What message?

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:17.650
The one about speaking to your class.
You had asked me to speak as a guest.

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:21.154
I thought with some ground rules
we could set some things straight.

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:24.699
Wait, you called me Friday?
You left a message?

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.743
Yes, at the house.

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:33.458
When did you call?

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:38.129
I don't know.
Around 4:00 or 5:00 maybe, on Friday.

01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:44.969
I didn't have any messages.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.056
Michael, for Christ's sake,
you had just found out about Brooke...

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:51.601
No, I didn't have any messages.
I'll call you back.

01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:03.071
-Yeah, Whit, listen to me.
-Michael...

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.531
I know you can't do anything for me.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:07.534
You can't give me any information.
But I can give you information.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:11.579
The other day when I was talking about
somebody trying to hide their history,

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.790
I was talking about my neighbor.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.917
Oliver Lang! That's his name.

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.710
He used to be...

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:20.755
It used to be William Fenimore!

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.258
I want you to run it through the system
for me. See what you've got.

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:25.885
-Oliver Lang. You writing this down?
-Yeah, Michael, slow down.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.430
He has a history, damn it!
Will you run the name?

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:30.056
Michael, Michael, wait! What's he done?

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:34.060
If I'm right, there were other people
who called my house that day, not just you.

01:19:34.145 --> 01:19:36.438
Find out, will you? You can do that.
Now, please.

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.815
-I'll call you when I get back.
-Back? Where the hell are you going?

01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:39.899
To get you proof!

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:41.151
Run the name, Whit.

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:42.819
Run the name!

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.075
Was it hard to find me?

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:34.412
You've moved several times.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.749
Your wife said that... Your ex-wife...

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:40.418
People know whose father I am.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:47.300
Mister, I've been through all this before.

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:51.262
The government, the police

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.766
and writers.

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.979
People wanted to believe it was political.

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:02.357
Some conspiracy, some group.

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.318
Abby and I did, too.

01:21:06.153 --> 01:21:09.697
Dean was not a strong boy.
He was impressionable.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.451
Believed what friends around him said.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:18.456
Why couldn't he be involved with people
who could set him up,

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:22.168
talk him into, you know, even this?

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:28.841
The FBI, the police, found nothing.

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:34.305
It was him alone. They decided this.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.017
Sixty-three dead.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.187
Over taxes.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.315
Dean alone.

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:47.026
You don't believe that, do you?

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:50.572
I will never believe that.

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:54.617
Have you heard the name Oliver Lang?
Or William Fenimore?

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:56.494
I've heard too many names.

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:59.664
Your son, Dean, was an electrician.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:03.876
Maybe, he was contracted for,

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:07.005
or he worked on a project...

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:10.174
All of this was investigated, mister!

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:13.761
His neighbors, his customers,

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:16.014
kids he grew up with, months ago!

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:19.434
Dr. Scobee, I'm sorry
for bringing this all back.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.185
It never goes away.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:24.063
I had to come here.
You've got to understand,

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.566
I think I know a man who knew your son.

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:29.235
He's 41 , a structural engineer.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:32.363
He's got a wife, three kids. He has this...

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:36.284
May I ask what makes you so sure
that this man of yours

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:37.910
had anything to do
with what happened here?

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:41.873
For the same reason you're sure
your son didn't do it alone.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:46.628
I know my son was not alone
because 10 children died that day!

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:50.298
The daycare center in the Roosevelt,
he had to know it was there.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.843
My son would never have done anything
to harm children. Not on his own.

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:56.054
-Your son didn't have any children.
-No.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.891
But he did things for them.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:04.228
He sponsored boys from city shelters.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.564
Discoverer Troops.

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:09.651
He coached boys football when he had time.

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:12.403
Wait. Wait, Discoverer Troops?

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:17.784
They're like Boy Scouts,
but for young children.

01:23:21.789 --> 01:23:23.748
He was a grown-up chaperone.

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:27.502
He'd take them camping.

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.922
He'd go to their meetings, teach.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:36.094
Here he is. He must've been
on some weekend adventure.

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:43.059
Dean was best with children.

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:55.405
Mr. Faraday? Professor?

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:06.791
Gate 40!

01:24:08.961 --> 01:24:11.254
Faraday. Grant Faraday.
I'll be there in a few hours.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:13.339
Don't let him go anywhere. I'm coming.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:14.966
Tell him I'm coming.

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:34.610
I'm here to pick up my son.
I called earlier this afternoon.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.279
My son!

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:37.822
What was that troop, sir?

01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:40.116
Troop? I don't know what troop!

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:42.827
He's from Reston. Grant Faraday.

01:24:45.164 --> 01:24:46.581
Where's my son?

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:47.832
Faraday?

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.668
-He was taken home this afternoon, sir.
-No.

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.336
His father called.

01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:55.214
No, no, wait, wait. I'm his father. I called.

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:58.342
But you, you called twice, sir.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:02.597
You said that there had been
an accident at home, a car accident.

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:03.723
No.

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:06.017
You asked to speak
with his Troopmaster, sir.

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:08.853
I'm his goddamn father. That wasn't me.

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:11.272
Here it is, sir. He was driven home.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:12.523
By who?

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.359
His Troopmaster, sir.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:19.197
He and another boy.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:21.908
What other boy?

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:23.826
Lang. Brady Lang.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:27.538
The Troopmaster left with both of them.

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:18.649
You're doing it again, Michael.

01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:21.736
I thought I told you, you should come to me
if there's something you want to know.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:24.071
-Where's my son?
-He's with mine. They're safe.

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:26.115
-Can I get you something to drink?
-I saved his life!

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:29.118
-What's that? Yes, yes.
-Your son, I saved his life!

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:31.412
And that's why you're still here with us.

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:32.997
And Brooke? What...

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:36.500
Brooke got in the way.
We're on a schedule. It's nothing personal.

01:27:36.627 --> 01:27:39.462
What the hell have you done with my son?

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:43.341
If you want to be his father,
you'll walk to your house,

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:46.969
sleep in your bed, teach your classes
and live your life.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:49.472
What are you doing?
How many people are you going to kill?

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:51.098
Well...

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.267
If I see any strange cars on my street,

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:57.021
if you feel compelled to talk to anyone,
a federal agent, perhaps?

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.690
Then I imagine we're just going to kill one.

01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:01.609
He's 9 years old.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:05.404
When will he be 10?

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:10.117
He's a good kid.

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:14.038
He's a strong kid.
Reminds me of a boy I grew up with.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.707
Maybe you've heard of him?

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.209
Oliver Lang?

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:22.129
They found him in the woods one day.

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:25.549
I would hate for Grant to see the same fate.

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:28.386
-You sick fuck!
-You're the sick fuck!

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:31.639
You're the sick fuck.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:39.397
I promise you, Michael,

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:45.736
if you stay a good neighbor,
and you are a good neighbor,

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.823
you'll have him back.

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:53.869
But if you don't calm down, I don't know
that I can guarantee his safety.

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:58.249
-This'll all be over in a few days.
-When?

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:01.752
-You're not in any danger.
-When? Tell me.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.838
Michael. Michael.

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.258
Please.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.346
Because of you, my son is alive.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:17.518
I would like very much to return the favor.

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:23.232
Now, we're having a party.

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:28.571
You're more than welcome to stay.

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:02.605
Come on, kids.

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.916
You got your lunch?

01:30:22.793 --> 01:30:24.919
We're going on a field trip today.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:26.587
-Bye, sweetie.
-Bye.

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:28.589
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

01:30:31.343 --> 01:30:33.010
Put your seat belt on.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.599
You're a hard man to find.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:40.935
Whit, what are you...

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:45.773
Your assistant told me you've been taking
long walks between classes, long walks.

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:48.526
Yeah. I can't talk to you now. I...

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:51.529
No? Can you talk to me ever?

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:56.867
You look like shit, Michael.
What's going on?

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:03.457
-I'm here about Oliver Lang.
-I've got to get to my class, Whit. I...

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:06.001
How about you teach me something?

01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:10.005
Oliver Lang, formerly William Fenimore.

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:13.050
We gave him a good look
after the St. Louis thing, Michael.

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:16.053
Everybody who ever used a bomb
got a good look.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.305
His name change was legal.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:21.809
We ran the social security number
through the National Crime Center.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:26.730
Not a mark on his record ever since.
Him and everyone he knew came up clean.

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:33.571
That's what you found out about?

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:39.493
That Wichita shit
back when he was 1 6 got you thinking.

01:31:40.579 --> 01:31:42.746
Do you have something new
on this guy or not?

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:45.416
Or did you just not like him
in your neighborhood?

01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:48.169
'Cause if you got nothing, Michael,
if this is all you've got,

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.337
then you know what?
You need to stop teaching that class

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:52.756
'cause it's getting inside your head.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:55.593
You tell me you got something to go on
and I'll go.

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:58.846
But I'm not going to walk into another
Copper Creek and neither should you.

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:02.641
I got nothing, Whit. I'm sorry.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:07.646
All right. Look...

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:14.486
I ran those phone records like you asked.
It could've meant my job, but I did it.

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:17.072
Two telephone calls on Friday,

01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:18.616
one from me and another from

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.535
a pay phone out Route 1 80,
Pine Glen Outlets.

01:32:22.078 --> 01:32:23.370
Pine Glen?

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.958
And a telephone call from your neighbor.
Nothing.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:39.053
Talk to me, Michael. What's going on?

01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:43.515
Talk to me.

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.109
Give up the goddamn class.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:02.910
Yeah, I'd like to rent a car
tomorrow morning.

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:04.495
How early could I pick that up?

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:09.500
Michael Faraday.

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:54.753
Oliver Lang, please?

01:33:54.838 --> 01:33:57.131
Mr. Lang is out of the office, sir.
Would you like to leave a message?

01:33:57.215 --> 01:33:59.133
No, I need to reach him.
This is a business emergency.

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:02.177
Mr. Lang isn't expected in this morning, sir.
Is there...

01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:04.096
No, I'll call back. Thanks.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.056
-Is there something else...
-No.

01:35:37.023 --> 01:35:38.023
No!

01:37:05.195 --> 01:37:06.236
Grant! Grant!

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:10.115
Grant!

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:04.753
Hey, neighbor, are you all right?
What are you doing on this side of town?

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:10.259
You had to know, didn't you?
You had to know.

01:38:10.343 --> 01:38:13.011
Couldn't leave your neighbor alone.

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:29.945
Didn't you check up on me?

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:31.321
Didn't you?

01:38:32.031 --> 01:38:34.616
Do you really think
we'd leave anything to chance?

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:35.742
Liberty One.

01:38:37.579 --> 01:38:39.371
-I've got you, Shadow. Go ahead.
-Oliver.

01:38:39.455 --> 01:38:41.331
We're still on schedule.

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:46.962
-You going to miss your son, Michael?
-Please.

01:38:48.131 --> 01:38:49.923
You've given me no choice!

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:54.136
You think I wanted this?
I told you, you were gonna get him back.

01:38:54.304 --> 01:38:57.681
How am I gonna do that now?
How am I gonna trust you?

01:38:58.016 --> 01:38:59.600
Where are you taking him?

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:01.143
Where's the bomb?

01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:06.898
I'm a messenger, Michael. I'm a messenger!

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:10.027
There's millions of us,
waiting to take up arms.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:14.114
Ready to spread the word! Millions of us!

01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:15.866
No!
The government is not who you're killing!

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:19.202
Yes, yes, they'll pay.
They'll pay for their sins.

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:21.705
-You're killing children!
-No lies. Children?

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:23.415
-Children die!
-This is war, Michael.

01:39:23.499 --> 01:39:25.459
In war, children die.

01:39:25.627 --> 01:39:27.836
You're with us. You're with us!

01:39:50.526 --> 01:39:55.864
-Liberty Two. Liberty Two, status?
-Shadow One, go.

01:39:56.032 --> 01:39:58.825
When they ask you what you stand for,

01:39:59.535 --> 01:40:04.164
you tell them you stand for
blowing up families, for orphaned sons.

01:40:06.626 --> 01:40:09.836
Your father really kill himself,
you son of a bitch?

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.923
Or is that just where you got your start?

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:17.052
-Call it off.
-It's for you, Michael.

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.263
-It's for all of us.
-It's not for me! Call it off!

01:40:20.723 --> 01:40:23.684
Are you happy in your godless,
suburban life?

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:27.604
Call off the bomb!
Call off the fucking bomb!

01:40:29.649 --> 01:40:30.649
No!

01:40:32.819 --> 01:40:35.445
They sent your wife to her death, Michael!

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:38.657
Surely, you won't be sorry to see them go.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:46.998
You're too late!

01:41:07.645 --> 01:41:08.687
Damn it!

01:41:20.408 --> 01:41:21.908
Let's get it done.

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:34.254
-Agent Carver.
-Whit, listen to me.

01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:36.631
There's a bomb on its way to your offices.

01:41:36.716 --> 01:41:38.383
You've got to get everybody out
of the building.

01:41:38.509 --> 01:41:40.594
-Michael, what's going on?
-It's in a white van!

01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:43.054
A Liberty delivery van! Grant's in there!

01:41:43.181 --> 01:41:45.432
-They're coming after you guys.
-Michael. Michael?

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:47.893
-They said they want the FBI this time!
-Michael!

01:41:48.019 --> 01:41:49.686
-You're breaking up!
-Whit?

01:41:49.812 --> 01:41:52.230
-Michael? Michael?
-Whit!

01:41:52.523 --> 01:41:53.523
Shit!

01:41:58.571 --> 01:42:00.363
Come on! Come on!

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:15.086
Security. Main Gate.

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:42.572
Shit.

01:43:07.265 --> 01:43:08.515
Out of the way!

01:44:01.903 --> 01:44:03.153
That's the van!

01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:04.738
Stop it!

01:44:10.202 --> 01:44:11.494
-Stop the van!
-Sir!

01:44:11.662 --> 01:44:12.954
Sir, step out of the vehicle!

01:44:13.039 --> 01:44:15.415
-There's a bomb in the van!
-Sir, step out of the vehicle!

01:44:15.499 --> 01:44:17.751
-Michael!
-It's got a goddamn bomb!

01:44:17.835 --> 01:44:20.462
-Michael.
-Whit, that's the van!

01:44:20.546 --> 01:44:21.880
There's a bomb in there!

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.882
That van was authorized!

01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:26.009
That's the van! Grant's inside!

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:27.844
It's the noon delivery.

01:44:30.056 --> 01:44:32.724
Grant's in there.
He's got a goddamn bomb!

01:44:42.193 --> 01:44:43.735
Hold your fire!

01:44:58.834 --> 01:45:00.043
Don't shoot!

01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:03.046
-In the van! In the van!
-Don't shoot.

01:45:05.716 --> 01:45:07.884
Get everyone out of the building!

01:45:08.094 --> 01:45:10.261
There's a bomb in the van!

01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:14.724
-Check the van.
-Whit!

01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:18.395
Get them out of the building!

01:45:18.521 --> 01:45:22.107
-Check the goddamn van.
-Whit. Whit.

01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:25.568
You have to get everybody out of here.
There's a bomb.

01:45:25.695 --> 01:45:26.903
It's in there!

01:45:30.116 --> 01:45:31.116
Wait. That's...

01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:36.830
-That's not the man. Grant!
-All right.

01:45:38.457 --> 01:45:41.418
-Let him go. I said, let him go!
-Let go.

01:45:41.585 --> 01:45:42.919
Let him go.

01:45:43.587 --> 01:45:44.671
Back off, back off.

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.214
The van's clean.

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:47.966
Grant!

01:45:48.759 --> 01:45:51.094
Go ahead, Michael, go ahead.

01:45:51.971 --> 01:45:54.139
-What's going on?
-Who is this guy?

01:46:04.734 --> 01:46:07.318
Michael, it's all clear.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.988
The guy is authorized to be here.

01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:14.451
We're all authorized to be here,
everyone except you.

01:46:17.455 --> 01:46:18.455
All right?

01:46:18.956 --> 01:46:20.123
Come on.

01:46:21.751 --> 01:46:23.209
Michael?

01:46:25.671 --> 01:46:27.172
It's all right.

01:46:32.678 --> 01:46:34.596
Come back. Michael!

01:46:43.647 --> 01:46:44.898
Hey, guys!

01:47:04.877 --> 01:47:06.002
Stand by.

01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:44.707
Everyone except you.

01:47:57.555 --> 01:47:58.555
Boom.

01:48:32.715 --> 01:48:35.592
Right now, I'm sort of breathless.

01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:40.889
I've just gotten here and there are people
lying on the pavement everywhere.

01:48:41.098 --> 01:48:44.642
I see at least a half a dozen people here.

01:48:47.104 --> 01:48:49.522
Their faces are covered with blood.

01:48:49.607 --> 01:48:52.525
There are crowds of people on the street.
Everybody's...

01:48:57.114 --> 01:49:00.450
The scene here is unbelievable!
It looks just like a war zone!

01:49:00.951 --> 01:49:03.453
I'm looking at the building right now.

01:49:07.124 --> 01:49:10.627
All I can tell you is part of it is blown away.

01:49:13.464 --> 01:49:16.382
Officials at this point believe
a bomb went off.

01:49:16.634 --> 01:49:18.968
They're not sure which floor, how big.

01:49:19.303 --> 01:49:23.139
Obviously, it was massive,
to create the kind of devastation...

01:49:23.265 --> 01:49:25.975
Officials by proxy have no idea at this point.

01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:29.229
They just know it is
an unbelievably serious situation.

01:49:57.925 --> 01:50:01.344
Preliminary reports indicate the bombing
was the work of this man,

01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:03.763
Michael Faraday of Reston, Virginia.

01:50:03.847 --> 01:50:07.183
A professor of history
at George Washington University...

01:50:07.268 --> 01:50:11.020
Officials will not confirm reports
that the bombing had anything to do

01:50:11.105 --> 01:50:15.108
with the death of Mr. Faraday's wife,
who had been an FBI agent.

01:50:23.284 --> 01:50:27.036
Students and colleagues both say
that Faraday's behavior

01:50:27.162 --> 01:50:30.123
was increasingly erratic
in the weeks leading up...

01:50:30.207 --> 01:50:33.793
He was really intense, you know,
knew all about these terrorists,

01:50:33.877 --> 01:50:36.170
how they worked, what they wanted.

01:50:36.338 --> 01:50:38.798
He was really into it.
It was my favorite class.

01:50:38.882 --> 01:50:42.010
We went to this field trip once.
It was Copper Creek.

01:50:42.219 --> 01:50:46.055
I mean, he practically broke down and
started crying, something about his wife.

01:50:46.181 --> 01:50:50.351
We all sort of knew about it,
but he never really wanted to talk about it.

01:50:52.062 --> 01:50:54.355
Faraday reportedly blamed the Bureau
for its role

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.899
in his wife's death almost three years ago.

01:50:57.067 --> 01:51:01.154
Specifically, sources speculate his target
may have been Agent Whit Carver

01:51:01.238 --> 01:51:04.407
one of the 184 people to perish in the attack.

01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:07.577
Carver was the partner of Faraday's wife
at Copper Creek.

01:51:07.703 --> 01:51:09.912
And Faraday may have
held him responsible.

01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:13.875
All I know is what he told me
in his office one day after class.

01:51:14.251 --> 01:51:17.420
You know, I'll never forget that. He said,

01:51:18.213 --> 01:51:21.841
"Sweetheart, one day
those men are going to pay.

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:26.179
"One day, those men are going to burn."

01:51:36.565 --> 01:51:40.693
Yet all of them described Faraday
as solitary, but friendly

01:51:40.944 --> 01:51:44.781
as a talented professor
fascinated by the American underground.

01:51:44.907 --> 01:51:48.201
And as a loving father to his 10-year-old son

01:51:48.285 --> 01:51:51.204
who is now in the care of relatives.

01:51:57.252 --> 01:52:01.047
After exhausting hundreds of thousands
of man-hours and leads,

01:52:01.131 --> 01:52:03.883
federal investigators are finally ready to say

01:52:03.967 --> 01:52:07.804
that just as in the St. Louis IRS bombing
nearly two years ago,

01:52:08.097 --> 01:52:12.809
this spring's attack on the FBI, the worst
terrorist strike in our nation's history

01:52:12.893 --> 01:52:16.104
was the work of one man
and one man alone.

01:52:21.485 --> 01:52:22.944
Any news yet?

01:52:23.487 --> 01:52:26.322
No. They'll let us know.

01:52:29.743 --> 01:52:31.285
Someplace nice?

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:33.746
I hope.

01:52:35.124 --> 01:52:36.833
Someplace safe.
