WEBVTT

00:07.300 --> 00:08.300
FOOTBALL?

00:08.300 --> 00:11.300
NO, NO. PAIN.
CLEATS ON FACE.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.300
MODERN DANCE?

00:12.300 --> 00:15.700
NO. LOT OF GIRLS.
TIGHTS. NO.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.867
DRAMA CLUB?

00:16.867 --> 00:20.100
NO. LOT OF GUYS.
TIGHTS. NO.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.300
THAT'S THE LIST, COR.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.567
NONE OF THESE ARE ME.

00:22.567 --> 00:26.834
HERE I AM,
STARTING MY EIGHT YEAR
OF PUBLIC EDUCATION,

00:26.834 --> 00:28.100
AND WHO AM I REALLY?

00:28.100 --> 00:29.934
YOU'RE YOU,
CORY MATTHEWS.

00:29.934 --> 00:31.767
BUT THERE'S NO
CORY MATTHEWS CLUB,

00:31.767 --> 00:35.567
A CLUB FOR GUYS
WHO DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE

00:35.567 --> 00:37.100
AND AREN'T GREAT
AT ANYTHING.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.100
START ONE.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.367
I PROBABLY
WOULDN'T GET IN.

00:39.367 --> 00:40.367
[BELL RINGS]

00:40.367 --> 00:42.600
YOU GOT A LOT
OF GOOD QUALITIES.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.800
YOU'RE HONEST, LOYAL,
AND DECENT.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.000
HOUSEBROKEN, TOO.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.867
I'M A STINKING BEAGLE.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.133
THIS JUST OFF THE WIRE.

00:51.133 --> 00:54.200
ELECTIONS FOR NEXT YEAR'S
EIGHTH GRADE CLASS PRESIDENT

00:54.200 --> 00:56.033
WILL BE HELD NEXT WEEK.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.367
WHO CARES?

00:57.367 --> 00:59.133
DETENTION!

00:59.133 --> 01:00.367
SORRY!

01:00.367 --> 01:03.900
YOU PEOPLE WHINE
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS RUN
AROUND HERE.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.200
YOU CAN CHANGE THINGS
BY GETTING INVOLVED.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.300
REMEMBER, THIS IS
A STUDENT ELECTION.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.767
[CLASS] IT'S NOT
A POPULARITY CONTEST.

01:11.767 --> 01:15.000
I THINK WE'VE BEEN SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.834
THE POINT IS,
YOUR CLASS PRESIDENT

01:16.834 --> 01:19.600
DOESN'T NEED TO BE
A QUARTERBACK OR CHEERLEADER.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.600
YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF
WITH SOMEONE

01:21.600 --> 01:23.500
WHO'S HONEST, LOYAL,
AND DECENT.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.934
CORY, THAT'S YOU.

01:24.934 --> 01:25.934
WHAT?

01:25.934 --> 01:28.133
YOU COULD BE PRESIDENT.

01:28.133 --> 01:29.133
COME ON.

01:29.133 --> 01:30.600
LET'S HAVE
SOME NOMINATIONS.

01:32.033 --> 01:33.500
I GOT SOMEBODY GOOD.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.500
I NOMINATE ME.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.000
YOUR HUMILITY IS IMPRESSIVE,
MEESE,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.300
BUT SOMEONE ELSE
HAS TO NOMINATE YOU.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.700
TOPANGA, HOW ABOUT IT?

01:39.700 --> 01:43.300
NO, GO AWAY.
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.867
MEESE HAS THE GUTS TO RUN.

01:44.867 --> 01:47.367
SOMEBODY HAVE THE GUTS
TO NOMINATE HIM.

01:47.367 --> 01:48.867
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL NOMINATE HIM.

01:48.867 --> 01:50.600
CORY, THAT'S
YOUR COMPETITION.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.667
I'M NOT RUNNING.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.667
ANYBODY ELSE?

01:52.667 --> 01:53.834
THE GREAT STATE OF SHAWN

01:53.834 --> 01:56.200
NOMINATE THE PEOPLE'S
CHOICE--CORY MATTHEWS.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.367
NO!

01:57.367 --> 01:59.834
HE'S NOT SETTLING FOR
SECOND-RATE LEADERSHIP.

01:59.834 --> 02:01.667
MATTHEWS, DO YOU ACCEPT?

02:01.667 --> 02:02.667
NO WAY!

02:02.667 --> 02:05.967
WOULD HE TURN DOWN
THE CHANCE TO SERVE.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.500
ARE YOU HIS HANDLER?

02:07.500 --> 02:08.500
YES, I AM.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.600
NO, HE'S NOT.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.200
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING PRESIDENT.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.834
I'M NOT SOMEBODY SPECIAL,

02:13.834 --> 02:17.000
I'M JUST AN AVERAGE GUY,
LIKE ALL OF YOU,

02:17.000 --> 02:18.600
THE SIMPLE, HARD-WORKING...

02:18.600 --> 02:21.000
STUDENTS WHO STRUGGLE
DAY AFTER DAY

02:21.000 --> 02:24.800
WITH TOO MUCH HOMEWORK,
UNFAIR TEACHERS,

02:24.800 --> 02:26.233
AND AN ANTIQUATED
JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:26.233 --> 02:28.033
THAT RELIES TOO MUCH
ON DETENTION.

02:28.033 --> 02:31.500
AND IF ELECTED,
IF YOU GUYS VOTE FOR ME,

02:31.500 --> 02:35.600
I WOULD SAY TO EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU,

02:35.600 --> 02:38.033
"HEY, THANKS!"

02:43.834 --> 02:45.100
YOU GOT SOMETHING, MAN.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.100
YOU COULD REALLY
WIN THIS.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.400
THERE ARE 400 KIDS
IN OUR GRADE.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.300
AND I DON'T KNOW
MOST OF THEM.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.100
THAT'S WHY WE'LL TAKE
YOUR MESSAGE

02:53.100 --> 02:55.233
FROM THE LUNCHROOMS
TO THE BATHROOMS,

02:55.233 --> 02:57.100
FROM THE HALLS
TO THE STALLS.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.600
WE HAVE TO TELL
EVERYBODY WHO YOU ARE.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.800
I'M NOT ANYBODY.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.000
SAY IT AGAIN!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.500
I'M NOT ANYBODY.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.700
THAT'S WHAT THEY LIKE.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.934
YOU'RE NOT SOME
HANDSOME, SMART
POPULAR GUY.

03:07.934 --> 03:10.500
YOU'RE NOT COOL.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN--

03:10.500 --> 03:12.000
HEY, WAIT.
I GOT IT.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
THANK YOU.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.567
YOU'RE ON MY SIDE,
RIGHT?

03:14.567 --> 03:16.000
THERE IS NO OTHER SIDE.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.500
I'LL PUT TOGETHER
A CAMPAIGN

03:17.500 --> 03:19.467
LIKE THIS SCHOOL'S
NEVER SEEN.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.734
AN UNSTOPPABLE
TIDAL WAVE,

03:20.734 --> 03:22.800
GATHERING SNOW,
BLAZING THROUGH THE SKY,

03:22.800 --> 03:25.400
CRUSHING EVERYTHING
IN ITS BEAK.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.967
YOU'RE GETTING OFF ON THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

03:28.967 --> 03:30.600
I GOT TO SAY,
I AM.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.033
THIS IS CORY MATTHEWS'
CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL

03:33.033 --> 03:34.400
DIRECTED BY ME.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.900
THE FOLLOWING IS PAID FOR

03:35.900 --> 03:37.467
BY CITIZENS TO ELECT CORY,

03:37.467 --> 03:40.900
WHICH, SO FAR, IS JUST ME.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.800
ACTION!

03:44.800 --> 03:47.367
CORY MATTHEWS...
LOYAL...

03:47.367 --> 03:48.967
HONEST...

03:48.967 --> 03:51.500
DECENT.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.667
A LEADER
WHO DARES TO SAY...

03:53.667 --> 03:56.400
HEY, I'M AVERAGE.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.367
WHY, HELLO THERE,
YOUNG LADY.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.800
AND WHAT
DO YOU THINK OF ME?

04:00.800 --> 04:01.800
HI, CORY.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.834
TELL ME YOUR PLAN
TO MAKE THIS SCHOOL

04:03.834 --> 04:07.400
A MORE EFFECTIVE
INSTITUTION FOR THE
ENTIRE STUDENT BODY.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.667
WELL, THAT'S A VERY--
SHAWN!

04:09.667 --> 04:10.700
CUT!

04:10.700 --> 04:14.200
TOPANGA, COULD YOU
JUST READ WHAT I WROTE?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.767
YEAH, LIKE
I'M GONNA SAY,

04:15.767 --> 04:17.000
"CORY'S CUTE AND CUDDLY.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.734
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT
TO ME AS A GIRL."

04:20.734 --> 04:21.734
WHAT?

04:21.734 --> 04:23.767
THIS IS NOT
HOW I THINK?

04:23.767 --> 04:25.200
OR HOW
ANY GIRL THINKS.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.367
AND THERE'S NO "M"
IN CUDDLY.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.467
TOPANGA, PLEASE.
SHAWN KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

04:30.467 --> 04:31.734
NO. NO, I DON'T.

04:31.734 --> 04:33.000
WHAT?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.500
SHE'S RIGHT.
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
MORE SENSITIVE

04:35.500 --> 04:36.767
TO OUR FEMALE BROTHERS.

04:36.767 --> 04:39.700
TELL YOU WHAT.
THESE, THESE ARE GONE.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.100
SAY WHATEVER YOU THINK
NEEDS TO BE SAID

04:42.100 --> 04:45.767
AS A HUMAN BEING
WHO HAPPENS TO BE FEMALE.

04:45.767 --> 04:46.767
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.800
COULD YOU WET YOUR LIPS?

04:48.800 --> 04:50.233
YOU ARE SO SLEAZY!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.367
WHAT?

04:53.367 --> 04:54.467
WHAT?

04:54.467 --> 04:57.100
THE IDEA HERE IS THAT
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER

04:57.100 --> 04:58.567
SHARE A COMMON BOND--
BROTHERHOOD.

04:58.567 --> 05:03.500
SO, BASICALLY,
YOU JUST WANT TO SEE ME
BEING AN OLDER BROTHER.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.000
THERE YOU GO.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.800
O.K. ACTION!

05:07.800 --> 05:09.000
HEY, COR!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.367
HEY THERE,
OLDER BROTHER.

05:10.367 --> 05:12.200
I WAS JUST
SITTING HERE THINKING

05:12.200 --> 05:13.834
WHAT MAKES
MY LITTLE BROTHER
SPECIAL?

05:13.834 --> 05:17.900
WHAT SETS HIM APART
FROM THE OTHER SEVENTH GRADE
CANDIDATES?

05:17.900 --> 05:19.934
IS IT HIS ALLERGY
TO SCALLOPS?

05:19.934 --> 05:20.934
ERIC.

05:20.934 --> 05:22.500
IS IT HIS SCOOBY-DOO
THERMOS?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.100
WHERE'D YOU FIND THAT?

05:24.100 --> 05:29.367
NO. I THINK IT'S
HIS FUZZY BUNNY PAJAMAS
WITH THE COTTON TAIL.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.867
I HAVEN'T WORN THESE
FOR YEARS. I SWEAR.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.367
BOINGY, BOINGY, BOINGY,
VOTE FOR ME,

05:34.367 --> 05:36.900
VOTE FOR ME,
BOINGY, BOINGY, BOINGY.

05:36.900 --> 05:37.900
CUT!

05:37.900 --> 05:40.600
HEY, GUYS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:40.600 --> 05:41.600
CUT!

05:41.600 --> 05:43.400
CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.900
IS THIS YOUR SCRIPT?

05:44.900 --> 05:47.400
NO! NO.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.800
"IT'S MORNING
AT CORY'S HOUSE.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.734
"AND CORY'S HAVING
PIZZA FOR BREAKFAST.

05:50.734 --> 05:53.667
"YES, CORY DOES
PRETTY MUCH
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

05:53.667 --> 05:57.100
WHY? BECAUSE HIS
PARENTS ARE DEAD."

05:58.934 --> 06:00.900
SHAWN WROTE IT.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.767
MRS. MATTHEWS,
I COULD LIE TO YOU.

06:03.767 --> 06:05.300
OH, WHY STOP NOW?

06:05.300 --> 06:09.400
OUR RESEARCH SHOWS
THAT PARENTS ARE NOT
THOUGHT OF AS COOL.

06:09.400 --> 06:13.300
SO IF WE POSITION CORY
AS "ON HIS OWN,"
INDEPENDENT,

06:13.300 --> 06:15.467
WE INCREASE
HIS LEVEL OF COOL.

06:15.467 --> 06:17.133
CORY, HOW COOL DO YOU FEEL

06:17.133 --> 06:20.100
ABOUT THE RECENT DEMISE
OF YOUR PARENTS?

06:20.100 --> 06:21.100
HEY, IT'S JUST
TEMPORARY, MOM.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.700
AS SOON AS I'M ELECTED,

06:22.700 --> 06:29.100
YOU AND DAD WILL BE FOUND
LIVING AMONGST THE BEARS
IN THE OREGON WOODS.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.500
O.K.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.667
MR. MacGRUDER,
I DON'T CARE TO HEAR

06:36.667 --> 06:38.567
WHAT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
TORE UP

06:38.567 --> 06:39.800
OR WHAT YOUR DOG ATE.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.600
I WANT YOUR PAPER
ON MY DESK
BY FIRST BELL TOMORROW

06:44.600 --> 06:45.667
OR ELSE.

06:45.667 --> 06:46.734
YOU'LL GIVE ME AN "F."

06:46.734 --> 06:47.900
I'LL GIVE YOU A "G."

06:47.900 --> 06:51.600
AS IN, "GEE, IF I'D JUST
DONE MY WORK ON TIME,

06:51.600 --> 06:56.934
I WOULDN'T BE
THE ONLY 40-YEAR-OLD
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE."

06:56.934 --> 06:58.667
TA TA!

06:58.667 --> 07:01.233
HE'S NOT HUMAN.

07:01.233 --> 07:03.300
YOU WANT HIM GONE?

07:03.300 --> 07:05.500
CAN YOU DO THAT?

07:05.500 --> 07:06.800
CORY CAN.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.000
IF HE'S ELECTED,
FEENY'S GONE.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.800
HEY, YOU CAN DO THAT?

07:11.800 --> 07:13.767
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

07:13.767 --> 07:16.934
THAT'S WHAT CORY WILL DO.

07:16.934 --> 07:18.000
SPREAD THE WORD.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.100
SHAWN,
I WANT TO WIN, TOO.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.600
BUT IN WHAT PART
OF YOUR DISEASED MIND

07:23.600 --> 07:28.200
DOES THE EIGHTH GRADE
CLASS PRESIDENT GET
TO FIRE THE PRINCIPAL?

07:28.200 --> 07:30.967
CORY, COME ON.
IT'S JUST
A CAMPAIGN PROMISE.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.667
IT'S WHAT YOU SAY
TO GET ELECTED.

07:33.667 --> 07:34.934
NOW, REPEAT AFTER ME.

07:34.934 --> 07:36.800
"GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT."

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
YEAH, BUT--

07:37.800 --> 07:39.300
GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

07:39.300 --> 07:43.867
GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT
THEY WANT.
GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

07:43.867 --> 07:45.600
IF TEACHERS GET PAID
FOR TEACHING,

07:45.600 --> 07:48.000
THEN STUDENTS
SHOULD GET PAID
FOR LEARNING.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
YEAH!
YEAH!

07:49.000 --> 07:50.834
AND HOMEWORK,
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

07:50.834 --> 07:53.700
IF THEY CAN'T TEACH ENOUGH
DURING SCHOOL HOURS,

07:53.700 --> 07:55.600
WHY IS THAT OUR PROBLEM?

07:55.600 --> 07:56.600
YEAH!
YEAH!

07:56.600 --> 07:59.200
THIS GUY
MAY BE CHEESIER
THAN WE ARE.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
WHAT DO WE DO?

08:00.200 --> 08:03.934
WE BREAK OUT
THE HEAVY CHEESE.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.300
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MY FRIENDS.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.400
HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE
ANYTHING THIS GUY SAYS?

08:10.400 --> 08:11.567
HE'S GOT STRAIGHT As.

08:11.567 --> 08:14.233
HE'S BEEN MAKING YOU
LOOK DUMB FOR YEARS.

08:14.233 --> 08:16.567
CAN YOU REALLY TRUST THIS,

08:16.567 --> 08:18.400
THIS CURVE BREAKER?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.600
CURVE BREAKER!

08:19.600 --> 08:21.400
CURVE BREAKER!
CURVE BREAKER!

08:21.400 --> 08:23.033
CURVE BREAKER!
CURVE BREAKER!

08:23.033 --> 08:24.033
TALK TO THEM, CORY.

08:24.033 --> 08:25.800
TELL THEM WHAT
THEY WANT TO HEAR.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.500
CURVE BREAKER!
CURVE BREAKER!

08:27.500 --> 08:29.100
MY FELLOW STUDENTS,

08:29.100 --> 08:31.000
THERE ARE MANY
CHALLENGING ISSUES

08:31.000 --> 08:33.100
WHICH CURRENTLY FACE
JOHN ADAMS HIGH...

08:33.100 --> 08:37.233
ISSUES THAT SEEMINGLY
HAVE NO SOLUTIONS.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.000
I SAY THERE'D BE
FEWER PROBLEMS

08:41.000 --> 08:43.400
IF WE SPENT
LESS TIME HERE.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.233
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THIS FIVE-DAY
SCHOOL WEEK?

08:47.233 --> 08:50.000
I'M PRETTY MUCH SHOT
BY WEDNESDAY,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.500
SO LET'S END
THE WEEK THERE.

08:51.500 --> 08:55.867
IF I'M PRESIDENT,
THURSDAYS AND FRIDAYS
ARE PART OF THE WEEKEND.

08:55.867 --> 08:57.200
YEAH!
YEAH!

08:57.200 --> 08:58.400
MONDAYS ARE OPTIONAL!

08:58.400 --> 08:59.400
YEAH!
YEAH!

08:59.400 --> 09:02.367
NOW, TUESDAYS, COME IN
PREPARED TO LEARN.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.367
YEAH!
YEAH!

09:03.367 --> 09:04.600
WE ARE THE FUTURE!

09:04.600 --> 09:07.300
HEY, YOU CAN'T MAKE
FIVE-DAY WEEKENDS.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.967
YOU CAN'T PAY KIDS
FOR GOING TO SCHOOL.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.100
ARE YOU QUESTIONING
MY INTEGRITY?

09:12.100 --> 09:13.300
YEAH, WE ARE.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.734
WELL,
I QUESTION YOURS.

09:14.734 --> 09:19.133
AND I HAVE PROOF.
NOBODY MOVE.

09:19.133 --> 09:21.400
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
ON US, DOES HE?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.800
NO. IT'S A BLUFF.
GOTTA BE.

09:22.800 --> 09:28.834
LISTEN, MAN, A LOT
OF WEIRD STUFF GOES ON
IN A TRAILER PARK.

09:28.834 --> 09:33.467
WHEN DO YOU STEP IN
AND TEACH THEM
THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS?

09:33.467 --> 09:37.000
IF MATTHEWS WINS,
TUESDAY.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.967
MR. TURNER, ALL I'M HEARING
FROM YOUR LITTLE ELECTION

09:39.967 --> 09:44.200
ARE RIDICULOUS PROMISES
AND CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.667
TOO MUCH LIKE
THE REAL THING?

09:45.667 --> 09:50.200
YES, BUT DON'T WE ASPIRE
FOR THEIR GENERATION
TO DO BETTER?

09:50.200 --> 09:52.600
YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T
JUST TELL THEM.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.033
THEY HAVE TO LEARN
FOR THEMSELVES.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.867
SO YOU'RE LETTING THEM
MAKE THEIR OWN MISTAKES?

09:56.867 --> 09:59.400
YEAH. IT'S NOT
A BAD WAY TO GO.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.400
I AGREE.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.800
IN FACT, I HAVE
THAT PHILOSOPHY

10:02.800 --> 10:05.600
TOWARD A CERTAIN
YOUNG TEACHER I KNOW.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.300
WHAT, YOU MEAN ME?

10:10.300 --> 10:12.133
VOTERS
AND VOTERETTES...

10:12.133 --> 10:15.000
THIS POOR EXPLOITED
YOUNG WOMAN

10:15.000 --> 10:16.100
IS NAMED PAULA.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.000
AND SHE HAS A SORDID
STORY TO TELL.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.200
GO AHEAD, PAULA.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.133
TELL THEM
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

10:22.133 --> 10:27.600
I WAS IN THIRD GRADE
WITH SHAWN HUNTER.

10:27.600 --> 10:33.000
ONE DAY, HE AND I
WERE STANDING NEAR
THE MONKEY BARS AND...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I CAN'T GO ON.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.300
GO AHEAD, PAULA.
BE STRONG.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.000
WELL, SHAWN SAID THAT...

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
THAT ALL GIRLS...

10:44.000 --> 10:45.133
WERE ICKY!

10:45.133 --> 10:46.133
OH...
OH...

10:46.133 --> 10:49.033
OH, COME ON.
I NEVER SAID THAT.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.233
YOU WROTE IT
ON MY NOTEBOOK.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.300
ALL...GIRLS...
ARE...ICKY!

10:54.300 --> 10:57.100
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I WAS ONLY 8.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.700
I DIDN'T LIKE GIRLS THEN.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.066
I LOVE THEM NOW.

11:00.066 --> 11:01.300
YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND?

11:01.300 --> 11:02.300
OF COURSE.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.934
FLIP-FLOP.
WHAT?

11:03.934 --> 11:04.934
FLIP-FLOP.

11:04.934 --> 11:06.767
HE CHANGES
HIS MIND
ABOUT GIRLS.

11:06.767 --> 11:10.000
WHO KNOWS WHAT
HE'LL CHANGE HIS
MIND ABOUT NEXT?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.867
FLIP-FLOPPER.
FLIP-FLOPPER.

11:11.867 --> 11:13.400
FLIP-FLOPPER.
FLIP-FLOPPER.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.900
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT, WAIT.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.300
SHAWN'S NOT EVEN
RUNNING HERE.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.500
BUT HE REPRESENTS YOU,
DOESN'T HE?

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
I SURE DO.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.567
CORY, ARE YOU DROPPING
OUT OF THE RACE?

11:22.567 --> 11:23.934
NO!

11:23.934 --> 11:27.000
ARE YOU DROPPING
YOUR FLIP-FLOPPING
SEXIST CAMPAIGN MANAGER?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.734
ALL I WANT
IS JUSTICE.

11:28.734 --> 11:30.100
SHAWN HAS TO GO.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.100
SHAWN MUST GO!
SHAWN MUST GO!

11:32.100 --> 11:34.300
SHAWN MUST GO!
SHAWN MUST GO!

11:34.300 --> 11:35.300
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.200
DON'T YOU GUYS
WANT A PRESIDENT

11:37.200 --> 11:38.934
WHO'S LOYAL
TO HIS FRIENDS 1,000%?

11:38.934 --> 11:39.934
NO!
NO!

11:39.934 --> 11:41.600
REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

11:41.600 --> 11:42.500
YES!
YES!

11:44.467 --> 11:46.834
THEN SHAWN IS OUT!

11:46.834 --> 11:48.667
YAY!
YEAH!

11:53.100 --> 11:55.133
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

11:55.133 --> 11:56.567
DID YOU HEAR THEM CHEER?

11:56.567 --> 11:58.367
WE PICKED UP
ON GIRL VOTES.

11:58.367 --> 12:00.200
WE WERE WEAK ON GIRLS.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.767
CORY, YOU FIRED ME!

12:02.767 --> 12:04.734
WELL, YEAH,
JUST A LITTLE.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.367
NO, IT WAS ALL OF ME.

12:06.367 --> 12:10.400
I HAD TO. WE'RE IN THIS
TO WIN, RIGHT?

12:10.400 --> 12:11.400
WE?

12:11.400 --> 12:12.667
WE?

12:12.667 --> 12:14.600
WE!

12:14.600 --> 12:15.967
SHAWN, YOU'RE SQUEALING.

12:15.967 --> 12:19.133
YEAH. THAT'S
THE SOUND YOU MAKE
WHEN YOUR BEST FRIEND

12:19.133 --> 12:23.100
STABS YOU IN THE BACK
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.967
I DID
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO.

12:24.967 --> 12:27.300
I GAVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANTED.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.000
WELL, I WANT
MY CAMPAIGN BACK.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.900
SINCE WHEN WAS IT
<i>YOUR </i>CAMPAIGN?

12:30.900 --> 12:34.400
SINCE I NOMINATED
YOU AND TOLD YOU
WHAT TO SAY.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.200
O.K. YOU WERE HELPFUL
IN THE EARLY GOING,

12:37.200 --> 12:38.900
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.133
YOU FIRED ME!

12:40.133 --> 12:44.133
SHAWN, MY FRIEND,
THIS IS NOT A TIME
FOR BITTERNESS.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.700
THIS IS A TIME
FOR HEALING.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.667
YOU KNOW WHAT,
CORY MATTHEWS?

12:48.667 --> 12:51.233
IF I MET YOU
JUST THIS MINUTE,

12:51.233 --> 12:54.100
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

12:54.100 --> 12:58.200
I'M CORY MATTHEWS,
THE NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE EIGHTH GRADE.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.100
NOT WITHOUT ME, PAL.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.934
SO HOW'S THE CAMPAIGN?

13:05.500 --> 13:07.700
WE'RE JUST RE-EVALUATING,
YOU KNOW,

13:07.700 --> 13:09.100
CONSIDERING A NEW DIRECTION.

13:09.100 --> 13:12.600
MM-HMM.
AND THAT WOULD BE DOWN?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.567
SHAWN WAS JUST
HOLDING ME BACK.

13:14.567 --> 13:16.100
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S A GOOD MOVE

13:16.100 --> 13:19.033
DUMPING YOUR
BEST FRIEND FOR
A CLASS ELECTION

13:19.033 --> 13:20.400
YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE ANYWAY.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.400
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.100
YOU'RE USED TO BEING
THE BIG MAN.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.767
MR. RUGBY SHIRT,
MR. GOOD HAIR,
MR. DIMPLES.

13:26.767 --> 13:29.200
OH, STOP. STOP.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.400
BUT WHEN I'M PRESIDENT,

13:30.400 --> 13:32.967
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
LOOK AT YOU AND SAY,

13:32.967 --> 13:34.834
WHO'S THAT SITTING
NEXT TO CORY?

13:34.834 --> 13:36.600
WHO'S GIVING CORY
A RIDE HOME?

13:36.600 --> 13:38.467
WHO'S THE GUY
WITH NAKED PHOTOS

13:38.467 --> 13:40.900
OF CORY RUNNING
THROUGH THE SPRINKLER?

13:40.900 --> 13:44.100
ERIC, BIG DEAL.
I WAS 4.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.100
YOU WERE 12.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.000
IT WAS REFRESHING.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.700
CORY, IT'S LATE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

13:54.700 --> 13:58.700
I'M WORKING ON MY SPEECH
FOR TOMORROW'S DEBATE.

13:58.700 --> 13:59.700
HEY, COR.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.700
YEAH.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.233
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA GET THEM

14:02.233 --> 14:04.867
TO SHOOT<i>BAYWATCH</i>
AT YOUR SCHOOL?

14:04.867 --> 14:06.600
WELL, WE HAVE A POOL.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.734
NO, YOU DON'T.

14:07.734 --> 14:09.367
KEEP READING.

14:09.367 --> 14:13.200
AH...OH,
AND A WATER SLIDE.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.367
OH, NICE TOUCH.

14:14.367 --> 14:17.834
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA CALL IT,
"RAGING PROMISES"?

14:17.834 --> 14:19.667
DAD, IT'S JUST
TO GET ELECTED.

14:19.667 --> 14:21.667
ONCE I WIN,
I'LL DO THE REAL STUFF.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.734
CLEAN UP THE GRAFFITI,
BETTER FOOD IN THE CAFETERIA,

14:24.734 --> 14:26.734
AN ALL-AROUND VOICE
FOR THE STUDENTS.

14:26.734 --> 14:30.100
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
WHY NOT PUT
THAT IN HERE?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.100
BECAUSE IT'S BORING.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.300
NOBODY VOTES FOR BORING.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.934
THEY WANNA HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE 'EM.

14:34.934 --> 14:37.100
EVEN IF IT'S NOT TRUE?

14:37.100 --> 14:40.834
DAD, YOU DON'T SOUND
LIKE YOU'RE BEHIND ME
ON THIS.

14:40.834 --> 14:42.200
CORY, I'M ALWAYS
BEHIND YOU.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.600
I'M NOT SURE
I'M BEHIND WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING HERE.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.867
I'M JUST TRYING TO WIN.

14:46.867 --> 14:49.200
WHY IS THAT
SO IMPORTANT?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.000
SO I CAN BE PRESIDENT.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.600
AND WHY
BE PRESIDENT?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.734
BECAUSE THEN
I'LL FINALLY FIT IT

14:54.734 --> 14:57.133
AND BE WHO I WANT TO BE.

14:57.133 --> 14:59.400
WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.867
CORY MATTHEWS.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.000
HONEST, LOYAL, DECENT.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.400
HONEST TO THE VOTERS,

15:04.400 --> 15:06.400
LOYAL TO
YOUR BEST FRIEND,

15:06.400 --> 15:10.567
AND DECENT ENOUGH
TO KILL OFF
YOUR PARENTS.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.867
AFTER THIS
MORNING'S DEBATE,

15:17.867 --> 15:19.500
YOU WILL RETURN
TO YOUR HOMEROOMS

15:19.500 --> 15:23.700
AND CAST YOUR VOTES
FOR EIGHTH GRADE
CLASS PRESIDENT.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.500
NOW...THE CANDIDATES.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.734
ALVIN W. MEESE.

15:29.734 --> 15:32.300
WHOO!
WHOO!

15:32.300 --> 15:35.100
AND CORY A. MATTHEWS.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.233
WHOO!
WHOO!

15:38.233 --> 15:42.000
SLIM PICKIN'S INDEED.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
WE WILL NOW HEAR
OPENING STATEMENTS.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.467
SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS,
GEORGE.

15:45.467 --> 15:48.000
YOU SAID I COULD BE
THE MODERATOR.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.200
NOW THERE'S EVEN MORE
TO MODERATE.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.400
OH.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.133
TECHNICALLY, WE NEVER CLOSED
THE NOMINATION PROCESS.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.400
SO, AS OF JUST NOW,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.200
THERE'S A NEW CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.467
GOOD. PERHAPS
A SERIOUS-MINDED
STUDENT,

15:59.467 --> 16:03.767
APPALLED BY
THE TAWDRY LEVEL OF
THE CAMPAIGN THUS FAR.

16:03.767 --> 16:05.100
SHAWN HUNTER.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.200
I QUIT.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.200
[APPLAUSE]

16:07.200 --> 16:08.467
HOW YOU DOING?

16:08.467 --> 16:10.834
VOTE FOR ME.
VOTE FOR ME.

16:10.834 --> 16:13.800
SHAWN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.233
WHAT I SHOULD'VE
DONE BEFORE.

16:15.233 --> 16:17.233
RUN FOR PRESIDENT
MYSELF.

16:17.233 --> 16:18.700
CAN HE DO THIS?

16:18.700 --> 16:21.800
THIS IS YOUR
LITTLE EXPERIMENT
IN DEMOCRACY.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.834
CAN HE DO THIS?

16:22.834 --> 16:24.900
WHY NOT? DEMOCRACY
IS ALWAYS INVIGORATED

16:24.900 --> 16:27.200
BY THE INFUSION
OF FRESH NEW IDEAS.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.800
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEAS,
MR. HUNTER?

16:29.800 --> 16:33.400
OH, YEAH.
BIG HONKIN' ONES.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.934
BIG HONKIN' ONES.

16:36.934 --> 16:40.567
SO, FLIP-FLOPPER, CALL
ANY GIRLS "ICKY" LATELY?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.300
THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING THAT UP.

16:42.300 --> 16:46.033
YES, I HAVE MADE
SOME MISTAKES
IN THE PAST.

16:46.033 --> 16:48.100
I HAVE CALLED
SOME GIRLS "ICKY."

16:48.100 --> 16:50.500
BUT THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO...

16:50.500 --> 16:51.834
WHEN I HAD COOTIES.

16:51.834 --> 16:56.100
THAT'S RIGHT.
I, SHAWN HUNTER,
HAD COOTIES.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.000
BUT I FOUGHT
MY WAY BACK

16:58.000 --> 17:00.066
AND I STAND
BEFORE YOU TODAY,

17:00.066 --> 17:02.367
COOTIE-FREE
AND GIRL-FRIENDLY.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.700
AND TO PROVE THAT,

17:03.700 --> 17:06.100
I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE TO YOU

17:06.100 --> 17:08.133
MY CO-CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT,

17:08.133 --> 17:09.734
PAULA KELLEY.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.400
AW...

17:14.400 --> 17:16.100
CAN HE DO THIS?

17:16.100 --> 17:17.500
CAN HE DO THIS?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.767
WHY NOT?
DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS--

17:19.767 --> 17:20.767
OH, BE QUIET.

17:20.767 --> 17:23.667
HOW FAR ARE YOU
WILLING TO LET THIS GO?

17:23.667 --> 17:25.734
I HAVE FAITH
IN THESE STUDENTS

17:25.734 --> 17:27.200
AND THE ELECTORAL
PROCESS.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.500
MAYBE JUST
ANOTHER MINUTE.

17:28.500 --> 17:32.233
SHAWN'S IN THIS RACE
JUST TO GET BACK AT ME.

17:32.233 --> 17:35.700
YOU'RE IN IT
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
KNOW WHO YOU WERE.

17:35.700 --> 17:39.133
I DO NOW.
I'M CORY MATTHEWS,
MAN OF THE PEOPLE.

17:39.133 --> 17:42.000
O.K. DIDN'T YOU
LIE TO THE PEOPLE?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.700
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.834
DIDN'T YOU MAKE
OUTRAGEOUS CAMPAIGN
PROMISES

17:46.834 --> 17:48.867
YOU KNEW
YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY DELIVER?

17:48.867 --> 17:50.967
YEAH. ONLY BECAUSE
YOU TOLD ME TO.

17:50.967 --> 17:54.700
IF I TOLD YOU
TO JUMP OFF
A BRIDGE, WOULD YOU?

17:54.700 --> 17:56.900
YEAH, I DID THAT ONCE.
REMEMBER?

17:56.900 --> 17:58.200
CAN YOU VOTE
FOR SOMEONE

17:58.200 --> 18:00.800
WHO'S DUMB ENOUGH
TO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.800
IT WAS A MINIATURE
GOLF BRIDGE.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.967
HE WAS GETTING MY BALL.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.233
DON'T CALL
MY FRIEND "DUMB."

18:05.233 --> 18:08.600
THERE'S NO ROOM
IN THIS CAMPAIGN
FOR NAME-CALLING,

18:08.600 --> 18:10.867
YOU FOUR-EYED,
FROG-VOICED GEEK.

18:10.867 --> 18:14.300
MY MOTHER DOES NOT
BUY MY CLOTHES.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.400
I RESIGN.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.000
HEY, NICE OUTFIT!

18:23.500 --> 18:25.400
ORDER. ORDER!

18:25.400 --> 18:27.100
THIS HAS ALL GONE
FOR ENOUGH.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.300
GO BACK TO YOUR CLASSROOMS
AND CAST YOUR VOTES.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.400
AND MAY GOD HAVE MERCY
ON YOUR SOULS.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.867
WAIT A MINUTE, MR. FEENY.

18:33.867 --> 18:37.400
BEFORE THEY VOTE,
SHOULDN'T THEY HEAR
WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY?

18:37.400 --> 18:38.567
NO!

18:38.567 --> 18:41.600
LOOK. I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT BEFORE THIS ELECTION,

18:41.600 --> 18:46.000
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS
OR WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.600
BUT NOW, WEEKS LATER,
AFTER LOOKING DEEPLY
INTO MY SOUL...

18:51.600 --> 18:54.467
I STILL HAVE NO IDEA.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.834
I KNOW LESS
THAN HE KNOWS!

18:57.834 --> 19:00.367
THANK YOU, MR. LINCOLN,
BUT WAIT YOUR TURN.

19:00.367 --> 19:04.700
SO I RAN FOR PRESIDENT
TO FIND OUT WHO I WAS.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.567
WHAT I THINK
I'M FINDING OUT

19:06.567 --> 19:11.500
IS THAT I'M NOT
A GOOD CANDIDATE...

19:11.500 --> 19:12.800
OR A GOOD FRIEND.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.033
SO I WITHDRAW
FROM THE RACE.

19:15.033 --> 19:17.600
I THINK EVERYONE HERE
SHOULD VOTE FOR SHAWN.

19:17.600 --> 19:21.033
HE'S REALLY THE BEST FRIEND
YOU COULD HAVE.

19:21.033 --> 19:25.834
NO, I'M NOT.
I'M WORSE THAN YOU.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.400
I MADE UP
EVERY LIE HE TOLD.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.133
I'VE KNOWN CORY
ALL MY LIFE.

19:30.133 --> 19:34.500
HE REALLY IS HONEST,
LOYAL, AND DECENT.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.000
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE,
COR.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.867
THAT'S ALL
YOU NEED TO BE.

19:38.867 --> 19:42.700
I WITHDRAW
FROM THE RACE, TOO.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.667
WELL, MR. FEENY,
WE'RE BOTH OUT.

19:44.667 --> 19:48.600
YES, WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'LL DO WELL
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.200
WAIT A SECOND. I WANTED
TO BE PRESIDENT.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.834
I WANTED MY LIFE
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

19:53.834 --> 19:56.300
YOU WANNA GO GRAB
A BURGER?

19:56.300 --> 19:57.700
I'M OUT.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.667
WELL, MR. TURNER,
YOUR EXPERIMENT
IN DEMOCRACY

20:00.667 --> 20:04.500
HAS LEFT THE EIGHTH GRADE
LEADERLESS FOR NEXT YEAR.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.600
TOO BAD. I WAS
LOOKING FORWARD

20:06.600 --> 20:08.133
TO MATTHEWS'
FIVE-DAY WEEKEND.

20:08.133 --> 20:09.400
O.K., FOLKS,
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.600
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.367
WE NOW RETURN YOU
TO YOUR REGULAR
FRIDAY SCHEDULE.

20:14.367 --> 20:17.867
WAIT A MINUTE.
OUR CLASS NEEDS A LEADER.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.000
IF WE IGNORE
ALL OUR PROBLEMS,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.834
THEY'RE NOT JUST
GOING TO...

20:21.834 --> 20:23.567
GO AWAY.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.500
THERE'S GRAFFITI
ALL OVER THE WALLS.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.500
AND THOSE OLD
SOCIAL STUDIES BOOKS,

20:27.500 --> 20:29.367
WHEN ARE THEY GONNA
REPLACE THOSE?

20:29.367 --> 20:33.400
AND HOW ABOUT BETTER FOOD
IN THE CAFETERIA?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.133
AND IF ELECTED,
I WILL BE A VOICE

20:37.133 --> 20:38.867
FOR THE ENTIRE
STUDENT BODY.

20:38.867 --> 20:39.934
SHE'S GOT MY VOTE.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.200
SHE'LL MAKE
A GREAT PRESIDENT.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.800
YEAH, I KNEW IT
WOULD ALL WORK OUT.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.934
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?

20:45.934 --> 20:48.100
YES, SIR,
VERY LUCKY.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.600
WE NEED SOMEONE
WHO'LL WORK HARD

20:50.600 --> 20:51.967
TO MAKE SMALL,
BUT REAL CHANGES

20:51.967 --> 20:54.033
THAT WILL MAKE
A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE.

20:54.033 --> 20:55.867
HONEST, LOYAL, DECENT.

20:55.867 --> 20:57.600
WHAT ABOUT
A WATER SLIDE?

20:57.600 --> 20:58.800
YOU GOT IT.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.600
AND THE POWER
MEANS NOTHING TO HER.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.367
TOPANGA!
TOPANGA!

21:03.367 --> 21:04.800
TOPANGA!
TOPANGA!

21:04.800 --> 21:07.500
TOPANGA!
TOPANGA!

21:16.667 --> 21:19.200
CORY SEEMED QUIET
DURING DINNER.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.967
AT LEAST WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO LISTEN TO
ANY CAMPAIGN PROMISES.

21:22.967 --> 21:26.000
POOR LITTLE GUY,
HE WOULD'VE MADE
A CUTE PRESIDENT.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.834
ACTUALLY, I'M KIND OF PROUD
OF HIM FOR DROPPING OUT.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.800
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE DROPPED OUT.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.200
YEAH, HE MADE A BUNCH OF
PROMISES HE COULDN'T KEEP.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.834
GOOD LESSON. YOU CANNOT MAKE
PROMISES LIKE THAT.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.033
PEOPLE REMEMBER.

21:39.033 --> 21:43.300
YEAH. LIKE WHEN YOU
PROMISED TO TAKE ME
TO EUROPE.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.667
EXACTLY.

21:44.667 --> 21:46.600
REMEMBER WHEN
YOU SAID THAT?

21:46.600 --> 21:50.000
YES, I DO.
WE WERE SITTING
AT THAT PLACE.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.967
WE WERE DRINKING WINE,
EATING STRAWBERRIES,

21:52.967 --> 21:54.300
AND YOU SAID,
"SWEETHEART,

21:54.300 --> 21:58.767
ONE DAY I'M GOING
TO TAKE YOU TO PARIS.
I PROMISE."

21:58.767 --> 22:01.100
AND THAT'S A PROMISE
I'M GOING TO KEEP.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.900
THIS SUMMER, PARIS.
BOOK THE TICKETS.

22:03.900 --> 22:06.000
OH, ALAN.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.300
PARIS. YOU AND ME, BABE.

22:10.367 --> 22:15.000
MOM, DID DAD REALLY PROMISE
TO TAKE YOU TO PARIS?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.300
OF COURSE HE DID...
JUST NOW.
