WEBVTT

00:12.767 --> 00:14.133
[camera shutter clicks]

00:27.333 --> 00:31.500
Shit! Hey. Shit.
They're coming--
They're coming this way.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.733
-They're coming over here.
-All right.

00:34.867 --> 00:36.500
[weapon cocking]

00:44.200 --> 00:46.533
[weapon cocks]

00:46.667 --> 00:48.333
[knocking on door]

01:02.267 --> 01:04.333
Hey, how's it going?
Can I help you with anything?

01:04.467 --> 01:06.867
Yeah, we saw you guys
just moved in across the street,

01:07.067 --> 01:10.233
and, well, we wanted
to welcome you to
the neighborhood.

01:11.867 --> 01:13.800
-I'm David.
-Jacob.

01:13.933 --> 01:17.133
Nice to meet you.
Consider this a little
housewarming.

01:17.267 --> 01:22.167
Ah! Oh, thank you. Oh, wow.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.700
Hey, I'd invite you in,
but, um, I haven't got
any furniture yet.

01:26.833 --> 01:29.267
Oh, not a problem.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.900
So, uh, what brings you boys
all the way out here?

01:34.067 --> 01:38.267
We're-- We're, uh, looking
for country property.
We're ranchers.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.533
-Ranchers?
-Yeah.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.233
-It is funny you say that.
-Why?

01:43.367 --> 01:46.067
We were just having this debate
on the walk over here.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.733
-Maybe you can settle it for us.
-Sure.

01:48.867 --> 01:53.300
How many cattle
can a West Texas scrub
carry per acre?

01:53.433 --> 01:58.333
I was at seven. Thibodeau here
was at 12.

01:58.467 --> 02:02.067
And Steve was out there
at over 20.

02:02.133 --> 02:04.500
What do you think?

02:04.633 --> 02:05.900
[chuckles]

02:06.067 --> 02:08.100
Uh, you know,

02:08.233 --> 02:10.500
my business partner
is the expert on all this,
and he's not here right now.

02:10.633 --> 02:13.100
But, you know,
when he gets back here,
I bet he'll answer that for you.

02:13.233 --> 02:18.133
No worries at all.
Say, we're having a little
gathering here this evening.

02:18.267 --> 02:20.400
-Love for you to join.
-Tonight?

02:20.533 --> 02:24.600
-You bet.
-Oh, man. Y'know, I got
a long day ahead of me.

02:24.733 --> 02:29.067
Well, we'd love to have you
and your friends, too.

02:32.233 --> 02:37.333
Well, thanks again
for the beer and the pizza.
Really appreciate it.

02:37.467 --> 02:40.467
-[chuckles]
-All right, we'll see you
around.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.567
[David] You have a good day now.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.167
One thing we know.

02:52.300 --> 02:56.133
-Those guys are not ranchers.
-Yeah.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.700
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, Gary.

03:32.833 --> 03:35.333
-Catch the game last night?
-Nah, I couldn't.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.833
But I did catch wind
of Mitch Decker's windfall.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.233
Ten million more for HRT, huh?

03:40.367 --> 03:42.367
-Yeah.
-You think that's a good idea?

03:42.500 --> 03:46.267
The world isn't getting
any more peaceful. I don't want
my men being outgunned.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.100
Well, if you put more guns
in people's hands,

03:49.233 --> 03:51.267
they're gonna use 'em.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.333
What does that mean?

03:53.467 --> 03:56.600
There's a paradox to power.

03:56.733 --> 03:59.200
The more force you bring
to a situation,

03:59.333 --> 04:01.433
the more likely you are
to meet resistance.

04:01.567 --> 04:05.933
If we could spend
some of those resources
training agents to negotiate,

04:06.067 --> 04:09.967
I guarantee that you would
invest a lot less in body bags.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.800
We can't talk our way out
of every situation.

04:12.933 --> 04:15.067
This is a good thing, Gary.

04:15.167 --> 04:19.067
A show of force helps bring
people to the negotiating table.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.533
[Gary sighs]

04:20.667 --> 04:24.433
You have a good day, too.
Thanks, Sheriff.

04:24.567 --> 04:27.533
[sighs] Well, it's not
Sheriff Harwell's people.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.733
Well, maybe it's Immigration,

04:29.867 --> 04:32.067
'cause a few people here
from other countries
don't have visas.

04:32.133 --> 04:36.100
I have to go on the record here
and say whoever they are...

04:36.233 --> 04:38.367
it doesn't seem
like the right move
inviting them in.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
What do you recommend we do,
then, Steve?

04:40.633 --> 04:42.967
At least keep them
at arm's length.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.400
It's not a bunch of locals
down at Cue Sticks.

04:45.533 --> 04:47.500
Push 'em away, it'll just
make 'em more curious.

04:47.633 --> 04:49.533
Show 'em we have
nothing to hide,
they'll lose interest.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.900
[Wayne] They don't have
probable cause.

04:52.067 --> 04:54.133
If we invite them in,
we'd be essentially giving them
a search warrant.

04:54.267 --> 04:55.733
What are they gonna
find here, Wayne?

04:55.867 --> 04:57.567
A bunch of nice people
studying the Bible?

04:57.700 --> 05:00.467
-Who knows?
-I agree with them.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.700
I don't think
it's worth the risk.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.833
[sighs]

05:04.967 --> 05:06.400
[clears throat]

05:07.900 --> 05:09.433
What do you think, Judy?

05:09.567 --> 05:11.800
You know, when I talk to people
about this place,

05:11.933 --> 05:14.133
they don't understand
what we're all doing here,

05:14.267 --> 05:17.900
but when they come
see for themselves,
then they get it, so...

05:18.067 --> 05:21.967
I don't see any sense
in putting walls up to keep
people out.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.967
This is a confidential
conversation, right?

05:33.100 --> 05:36.067
[man] Can be. What's going on?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.700
I just-- I saw something go down
that I didn't think was right.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.067
-And--
-[man] What's that?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.867
Ruby Ridge.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.500
Yeah, heard that wasn't as clean
as they made it sound.

05:46.633 --> 05:50.167
[Gary] No, it wasn't.
An innocent woman was killed.

05:50.300 --> 05:53.133
It's not sitting well with me,
and, you know, things happen.

05:53.267 --> 05:58.433
I've been involved
when things happen, and...
I'm not looking to burn someone,

05:58.567 --> 06:02.533
but when they're rewarded
for blatant misconduct, I...

06:05.333 --> 06:09.633
[sighs] So, what's this gonna
look like if I decide to file
a complaint

06:09.767 --> 06:12.567
-against one of my peers?
-I'm not gonna lie to you, Gary.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.700
People who file these complaints
do not win any popularity
contests,

06:16.833 --> 06:20.067
but if you do decide to move on
this...

06:23.500 --> 06:24.933
fill out these forms.

06:28.167 --> 06:32.367
I'm not worried about the guns.
We've been pretty careful there.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.867
But, Wayne, where are we
vulnerable?

06:38.400 --> 06:43.067
Your sister, Michelle.
That's where we're vulnerable.

06:45.567 --> 06:49.667
Texas law allows for marriage
at 14 with parental consent,
which you have,

06:49.800 --> 06:52.433
but marrying more than one woman
is illegal.

06:52.567 --> 06:56.967
And sexual relations
with someone under 18
who's not your wife

06:57.100 --> 06:59.667
is also illegal.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.567
Michelle is where you have
a catch-22.

07:02.700 --> 07:06.100
It's statutory rape
or it's polygamy.

07:06.233 --> 07:12.367
Either way,
they could arrest you
and try to take the kids.

07:21.967 --> 07:24.900
[David] Hey, Thibs.
How you doin'?

07:25.067 --> 07:30.067
All right.
What's-What's going on?

07:30.167 --> 07:32.600
[David] Well...

07:32.733 --> 07:35.533
we have a bit
of a situation here.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.833
And we could really use
your help.

07:40.933 --> 07:44.233
When a message as important
as David's comes into the world,

07:44.367 --> 07:46.200
they'll do anything they can to
stop it.

07:46.333 --> 07:50.400
That's why we need
to button things down
from a legal standpoint.

07:50.533 --> 07:54.500
Michelle having
had children with David
is where we have an issue.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.067
I want you to marry Michelle.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.800
That'll solve our problem.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.400
[chuckles]

08:28.533 --> 08:32.733
-Take your time.
-All right. [chuckles]

08:32.867 --> 08:33.967
Uh...

08:35.500 --> 08:38.867
-Whatever you need.
-Thank you.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.500
What's the matter?

08:51.633 --> 08:53.667
You really have to ask?

08:56.067 --> 08:58.100
What is it? Thibodeau?
Do you not wanna marry him?

08:58.233 --> 09:02.267
No, this has nothing to do
with Thibodeau. [sighs]

09:02.400 --> 09:04.200
Then what's it got to do with?

09:11.467 --> 09:12.867
You.

09:14.567 --> 09:16.700
Me?

09:16.833 --> 09:20.633
I was 12 when David
had his vision that he should
take me as his second wife.

09:20.767 --> 09:24.067
And nobody knew what to do
about it...

09:24.167 --> 09:28.233
until your dream telling you
that God demanded it.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.633
And-And just like that,
I became his second wife.

09:34.767 --> 09:38.267
And just like that,
I had Serenity, and...
and just like that,

09:38.400 --> 09:42.400
she might be taken away from me
all because of your dream.

09:42.533 --> 09:46.067
I mean, what about my dream?
Who cared anything
about my dreams?

09:46.133 --> 09:50.233
-Hasn't David been good to you?
-That's not the point.

09:50.367 --> 09:53.667
I love David, but I never
had a choice in any of it.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.167
You think I would choose
to share my husband?

09:56.300 --> 09:58.067
[sobbing]

10:00.333 --> 10:02.567
That dream was real, Michelle.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.700
God demanded it,
and I know you know it, too.

10:07.267 --> 10:10.767
We follow God's lead regardless
of what we might want.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.533
We need to hurry
and get these inside.
Storm's coming.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.867
Our informer who defected
from the group said the guns
are in this room here.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
It's on the second floor.
You gotta confirm it.

10:29.467 --> 10:30.833
All right, I'm on it.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.733
Jacob, leave the sidearm.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.367
Come on.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.367
You're gonna send me in there
unarmed?

10:41.500 --> 10:44.233
These guys know guns.
They're gonna-- They're gonna
notice it.

11:14.133 --> 11:20.133
Right now, the plan is
to have two groups of agents
bring ladders to this wall here.

11:20.267 --> 11:23.500
And that's where we'll make
our dynamic entrance
into the gun room.

11:23.633 --> 11:26.800
To get a good shot of you
coming out with the children
and the guns,

11:26.933 --> 11:30.233
I'm gonna need my camera guy
embedded with your men.

11:30.367 --> 11:33.733
Angela, that's too close
to the line of fire.

11:33.867 --> 11:37.067
Ed, you brought me in
to manage the press.
Let me do my job.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.133
[knocking on door]

11:42.867 --> 11:45.833
Oh, hey. Uh, David asked me
to drop by.

11:45.967 --> 11:49.100
-Here I am. [chuckles]
-Okay. Yeah, come on in.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.367
-He's in the chapel, so...
-He is?

11:54.500 --> 11:57.700
Yeah. We're about to start
our evening Bible study.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.333
-Uh, it's in there.
-Oh, okay. Thank you.

13:05.933 --> 13:07.233
[Rachel] Who are you?

13:11.333 --> 13:13.300
Jacob.

13:13.433 --> 13:16.700
-My name's Jacob.
David invited me over.
-These are the women's quarters.

13:16.833 --> 13:19.867
-You're not allowed
to be up here.
-Oh, hey, I'm terribly sorry.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.367
I just got lost.
I was looking for the chapel.

13:23.733 --> 13:26.400
Chapel's this way. Come with me.

13:26.533 --> 13:27.833
Okay.

13:36.567 --> 13:39.233
Just like the newspaper
gives you the hot scoop

13:39.367 --> 13:42.200
of what happened yesterday...

13:42.333 --> 13:45.467
scripture gives you
the hot scoop of what's
going to happen.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.600
The Bible is a book of
prophecy...

13:49.733 --> 13:53.333
that talks about all of us here
in this room.

13:53.467 --> 13:57.367
Now, we know
the Book of Revelation
speaks of what?

13:57.500 --> 14:00.900
-[all] The Seven Seals.
-The Seven Seals.

14:01.067 --> 14:04.300
And the opening
of those seven seals
will bring the end times,

14:04.433 --> 14:08.300
when God will establish
His kingdom here on earth.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.067
And it also talks about a what?

14:10.133 --> 14:12.267
-[all] Lamb.
-[David] A lamb.

14:14.367 --> 14:20.400
A lamb who can open
those seven seals for the rest
of the world to understand.

14:23.933 --> 14:25.633
I am that lamb.

14:30.933 --> 14:34.633
Now, I've already proven to you
how the first four seals
have been opened.

14:34.767 --> 14:39.333
We here in this room have
been brought to Mount Carmel
to open the fifth.

14:41.067 --> 14:43.933
How do we know when that's
gonna happen?

14:45.867 --> 14:47.233
[sighs]

14:47.367 --> 14:50.067
Opening the fifth seal...

14:50.200 --> 14:54.100
as I've been telling you
for years...

14:54.233 --> 15:00.067
will begin when the armies
of Babylon come to our door
to spill our blood.

15:03.467 --> 15:08.067
We will then be tested,
mind, body, and spirit.

15:20.567 --> 15:22.067
[Rachel murmurs]

15:25.867 --> 15:27.133
[David clears his throat]

15:29.600 --> 15:31.567
[whispering]

15:38.833 --> 15:41.500
Not all of us will stay
for those final moments.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.600
But those that do...

15:45.733 --> 15:49.067
will have a special place
in God's kingdom.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.433
It's a big choice.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.700
The biggest one
you'll ever face.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.733
Now...

15:58.867 --> 16:02.933
[sighs] It's been brought
to my attention...

16:03.067 --> 16:05.333
that someone here has broken
a rule.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.533
And in order to make an example
of them...

16:25.933 --> 16:28.233
I'm gonna give him a licking...

16:28.367 --> 16:31.433
in front of all of you.

16:31.567 --> 16:32.667
Follow me.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.667
Who snuck in here and ate the
ice cream?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.600
Who was it?

17:18.800 --> 17:21.667
I did it, Dad.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.700
Come here.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.433
You placed this ice cream
ahead of all of them
in this room.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.867
Are you ready for your licking?

17:43.067 --> 17:44.333
Yes, Dad.

17:46.667 --> 17:47.567
All right, then.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.500
-Go on, then.
-[woman chuckles]

18:00.800 --> 18:01.900
[all chuckling]

18:09.433 --> 18:11.433
If we're all just one body
here...

18:13.233 --> 18:16.400
Cyrus' sins are all our sins,

18:16.533 --> 18:21.067
and we are all guilty
of putting ourselves first.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.433
And for that...

18:23.567 --> 18:25.300
we all deserve the same
punishment.

18:25.433 --> 18:28.333
[all chuckling]

18:30.200 --> 18:31.933
You had your fill. Go on.

18:36.833 --> 18:38.333
[child] I'm getting one?

18:48.100 --> 18:50.933
[Jacob] So, uh, what are
all these people doing here?

18:51.067 --> 18:53.733
This is a place where people
come to find answers, Jacob.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.267
-Answers to what?
-Whatever questions they have.

18:56.400 --> 19:00.067
The world isn't always
a friendly place. It can really
grind a person up,

19:00.167 --> 19:03.367
break their spirit,
throw 'em out like garbage.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.433
Here, we take in that garbage...

19:05.567 --> 19:08.533
clean it up, put 'em back
together again.

19:08.667 --> 19:12.133
For some reason,
pain makes some men hateful

19:12.267 --> 19:13.833
and others kind.

19:15.933 --> 19:18.600
You have that kindness.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.067
Thanks.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.700
If I had to guess,
you were raised by women.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.467
Yeah. Yeah, my mom.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.433
Me too. Mom and Grandma.

19:30.567 --> 19:34.067
Your mom, she still alive?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.433
Yeah.

19:37.167 --> 19:38.767
Something wrong with her?

19:41.067 --> 19:43.333
Well, she's got dementia.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.333
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:45.467 --> 19:49.500
Yeah, well, my mom
lived her life exactly how
God wanted her to,

19:49.633 --> 19:51.967
and then God
pays her back like this?

19:52.100 --> 19:53.433
I mean, come on.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.633
You know the shortest verse
in the Bible, Jacob?

19:58.767 --> 20:00.400
Nah.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.000
-"Jesus wept."
-"Jesus wept."

20:03.133 --> 20:06.067
One of the biggest problems
we have as people today is,
for some reason,

20:06.200 --> 20:09.533
they have it in their head
that they shouldn't have
any troubles.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.033
-Ah.
-That suffering is a mistake.

20:13.167 --> 20:15.000
-Or it's unfair.
-Mm.

20:15.133 --> 20:17.733
Or it's God being ornery.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.833
But what if suffering
is the point...

20:21.433 --> 20:24.767
so that we can learn to let go
and be easy in the spirit?

20:26.700 --> 20:28.867
You might think you know
the reason why you're here...

20:32.367 --> 20:34.567
but I know why
you're really here.

20:39.967 --> 20:42.400
God brought you to me...

20:42.533 --> 20:44.767
to help you find your way.

20:47.767 --> 20:49.500
[shaking hands]

20:58.900 --> 21:00.500
[both grunting]

21:09.333 --> 21:11.567
Ah! What's wrong?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.933
I started to enjoy myself.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.800
You can enjoy yourself
a little bit, David.
I am your wife.

21:18.933 --> 21:24.067
I know. But we can't succumb
to the pleasures of the flesh.

21:24.167 --> 21:28.733
We have to rise above that,
as hard as it can be sometimes.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.467
What if it is Child Services?

21:36.600 --> 21:40.367
Usually, agents
from Child Protective Services
are women, not men.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.067
But what if it is?

21:44.300 --> 21:47.067
David, we follow
Talmudic law here.

21:47.133 --> 21:50.300
We live our lives by the rules
laid out in the Bible,

21:50.433 --> 21:54.933
and we all here believe that's
the right thing to do, but...

21:55.067 --> 21:58.967
those men live by man's law,
not God's.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.833
I worry that if we're going
to be judged by man's law,

22:02.967 --> 22:05.567
we're more vulnerable
than you think.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.400
What are you really scared of?

22:07.533 --> 22:09.533
I'm afraid they're gonna
come after our children.

22:09.667 --> 22:14.067
No. They can't.
They don't have the right.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.933
But what if they think they have
the right? What then?

22:21.900 --> 22:22.933
[Jacob] Hey, Ed.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.667
What's, uh--
What's all this about?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.533
Operation Showtime.

22:28.667 --> 22:31.600
-Oh.
-We're planning the assault.

22:31.733 --> 22:33.800
-So, where you at?
-Well, I've been inside.

22:33.933 --> 22:35.933
I searched the floor
the informant had flagged down,

22:36.067 --> 22:38.200
and, uh, I couldn't--
I couldn't find any weapons.

22:38.333 --> 22:41.333
The weapons are in there.
I need you to step up
your efforts.

22:41.467 --> 22:43.467
Get creative if you have to.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.067
If you want the guy that bad,
he jogs past our place
every morning,

22:46.133 --> 22:48.167
so you can pick him up then
and there if you want him.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.967
And how many joggers
have you seen being arrested
on the news?

22:51.100 --> 22:53.567
-I'm sorry, and you are?
-I'm Angela Duke.

22:53.700 --> 22:57.367
Special agent in charge
of publicity for the ATF.

22:57.500 --> 23:02.333
Look, right now, all I can get
is a knock-and-serve
search warrant.

23:02.467 --> 23:06.667
I need more than that.
You have to find me something.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.700
I'm on it.

23:11.067 --> 23:14.133
I had a friend run our
neighbors' plates,

23:14.267 --> 23:18.433
and they're all registered
to a government building
in Houston.

23:18.567 --> 23:21.267
They're federal agents
of some kind.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.500
We don't know that.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.200
-[Wayne sighs]
-David...

23:25.800 --> 23:27.533
what more do you need?

23:27.667 --> 23:31.067
They're not ranchers.
Why are you refusing
to see this?

23:31.200 --> 23:37.067
Steven... you yourself came here
to disprove me.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.600
But when I showed you the truth,
did you not believe me?

23:42.067 --> 23:45.333
-Yes or no?
-Yes. Yes.

23:45.467 --> 23:50.500
Wayne, your wife
dragged you here
kicking and screaming.

23:50.633 --> 23:56.200
But when I showed you
the truth about your son,
did you not believe me?

23:56.333 --> 23:57.767
Yes or no?

24:00.233 --> 24:04.600
You both stayed. Why?

24:04.733 --> 24:09.267
Because there are people
in this world that can hear
the truth.

24:11.333 --> 24:15.100
That man, he's searching.

24:15.233 --> 24:20.200
God sent him to me.
Who am I to turn him away?

24:21.400 --> 24:25.433
David, your heart is in
the right place.

24:25.567 --> 24:32.067
But... you are opening us up
to a whole lot of trouble.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.067
Why take the chance?

24:41.367 --> 24:43.067
Because I can turn him.

24:50.767 --> 24:54.267
[phone ringing]

24:54.400 --> 24:56.600
-Hello?
-Hey, Mom.

24:56.733 --> 24:59.167
-Hey!
-I got some good news.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.067
Are you still down
in that commune in Texas?

25:02.200 --> 25:04.400
Mount Carmel. Yeah, still here.

25:04.533 --> 25:06.800
Yeah, well,
I saved up enough money
to get a ticket.

25:06.933 --> 25:10.233
I wanna come down
and see this place that got you
so interested in the Bible

25:10.367 --> 25:12.500
-all of a sudden.
-Yeah, maybe soon, Mom.

25:12.633 --> 25:15.967
[chuckles] Why, it's like
you're afraid I'm gonna tell
that David joker

25:16.100 --> 25:20.200
that the Bible's just
a bunch of man shit,
which it is, by the way.

25:20.333 --> 25:23.067
Yeah, that's kinda my worry.
[chuckles]

25:23.200 --> 25:25.367
So, what's the big news?

25:27.867 --> 25:29.067
Um...

25:31.400 --> 25:34.267
I'm gonna try to fly up
and visit you soon.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.767
-Okay?
-Yeah.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.333
Yeah, I'd like that.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.233
Dave, listen.

25:46.367 --> 25:49.533
I know you found
something there that means
a lot to you,

25:49.667 --> 25:54.333
but I just want you
to remember to keep a little bit
of yourself for yourself.

25:54.467 --> 25:56.800
Okay?

25:56.933 --> 26:00.900
-Yeah, Ma, I will.
-Love you.

26:01.067 --> 26:05.300
Okay. Love you, too. Bye.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.233
You look nice.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.533
Thanks.

26:29.767 --> 26:31.733
Thank you, Thibs...

26:31.867 --> 26:34.667
for all that you're doing
for us.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.967
Yeah, no, it's...

26:37.100 --> 26:40.867
I don't wanna
see anything happen
to you or Serenity, so...

26:41.067 --> 26:42.900
[chuckles] That's sweet.

26:46.733 --> 26:49.133
Stop being so nervous.
It's not like we're actually...

26:49.267 --> 26:51.433
[giggles] ...getting married.

26:51.567 --> 26:55.067
You know, nothing's expected
of you.

26:55.200 --> 26:59.433
Well, it'd be okay
if you did expect a little.

26:59.567 --> 27:01.633
I can handle it.

27:01.767 --> 27:04.767
Come on, Thibs,
you know you can't see the bride
on her wedding day.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.100
-It's bad luck.
-Oh. Okay.

27:07.233 --> 27:10.133
All right, here it is.

27:10.267 --> 27:11.900
What do you think?

27:16.100 --> 27:18.600
It's-- It's beautiful.

27:18.733 --> 27:21.267
Was that your dress
when you married Steve?

27:21.400 --> 27:26.067
Yeah. Hey. Michelle,
I know your mom's not here,

27:26.200 --> 27:30.367
but she'd want you to have
something nice for your big day,
something special.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.900
-Go on, try it on.
-[chuckles] Okay.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.833
Uh, you know, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

27:41.967 --> 27:45.133
-Yeah.
-Um...

27:45.267 --> 27:49.833
Just be careful giving David
advice.

27:49.967 --> 27:51.867
What's that?

27:52.067 --> 27:54.433
Well, it's just...
you're the mother
to one of his children now.

27:54.567 --> 27:57.500
You might not think
that makes a difference,
but it does.

27:57.633 --> 28:03.400
He'll listen to you now.
So I need you to measure
your words a bit better, Judy.

28:03.533 --> 28:07.333
See, when I speak,
I speak for all the mothers,
not just myself.

28:07.467 --> 28:12.533
Just... need you to follow
my lead a little better.

28:17.067 --> 28:18.433
[door opens]

28:20.867 --> 28:24.567
-Mind if I bend your ear
for a minute?
-Sure. What's going on?

28:26.900 --> 28:28.600
A friend came to see me.

28:31.267 --> 28:33.400
Word is you're thinking
of filing a complaint.

28:35.433 --> 28:37.967
Look, Gary, I don't know
what your problem is with me,

28:38.100 --> 28:42.133
but I don't have
a problem with you,
and I don't want one.

28:44.633 --> 28:49.367
When I negotiate,
I always try to see
five steps ahead, you know?

28:49.500 --> 28:53.167
But you have a tendency
to react

28:53.300 --> 28:55.967
to what's going on
in the moment.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.067
Sometimes you don't see
the big picture.

28:58.133 --> 28:59.767
Say what you wanna say, Noesner.

28:59.900 --> 29:04.233
I see the direction the Bureau's
heading in, and I don't like it.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.700
You know as well as I do
the more firepower you get,

29:06.833 --> 29:08.900
the less chance I get
to solve things peacefully.

29:09.067 --> 29:11.967
You really see yourself
as some kinda Boy Scout,
don't ya?

29:12.100 --> 29:15.067
But you're digging
in the same filth
as the rest of us.

29:15.167 --> 29:18.300
Your hands are no cleaner
than mine.

29:18.433 --> 29:21.400
Remember Sperryville?

29:21.533 --> 29:23.900
I do.

29:24.067 --> 29:25.500
Take a look
at the big picture here.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.533
Look five steps ahead
of what happens...

29:28.667 --> 29:30.933
if you decide
to come after me now.

29:31.067 --> 29:33.767
[suspenseful music playing]

29:37.500 --> 29:39.833
[Barry] All right.
Come on, let's go over it again.

29:39.967 --> 29:42.900
-I got it. I'm telling you,
I got it.
-Do you?

29:43.067 --> 29:44.967
Yeah. So, I go to the wedding,

29:45.100 --> 29:49.533
and I show him my illegal gun,
and he'll show me
his illegal guns.

29:49.667 --> 29:51.100
We good? You happy?

29:51.233 --> 29:53.533
Is there a problem?

29:55.433 --> 29:57.467
Come on, man.
This whole thing
doesn't smell to you?

29:57.600 --> 30:01.733
-'Cause it really smells to me.
-They wanna do this,
we gotta do it.

30:01.867 --> 30:08.200
And don't forget,
this guy belongs in jail.
You're good, right?

30:19.900 --> 30:21.400
[David] Glad you made it!

30:21.533 --> 30:24.767
I was just thinking about you.
Thanks for coming.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.367
-So was I.
-Come on in.

30:26.500 --> 30:30.233
[playing "Here Comes the Bride"]

30:51.100 --> 30:56.233
We're all here together today
to celebrate love and family.

30:58.933 --> 31:02.167
Because that's what
it's all about, isn't it?

31:04.633 --> 31:10.667
Do you, David Thibodeau,
take Michelle here
to be your wife?

31:10.800 --> 31:11.733
I do.

31:11.867 --> 31:13.933
And do you, Michelle,

31:14.067 --> 31:19.500
take this rock star,
David Thibodeau,
to be your husband?

31:20.767 --> 31:23.300
I do.

31:23.433 --> 31:27.267
Then I pronounce y'all
husband and wife.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.700
Go on, then. Kiss your bride.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.467
Go on.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.200
-[rock music playing]
-Congratulations.

32:08.433 --> 32:09.967
* Ooh *

32:10.100 --> 32:14.267
* Something's got a hold
on me now *

32:14.400 --> 32:15.967
* It's a feeling *

32:16.100 --> 32:20.400
* Burning like a log
on fire *

32:20.533 --> 32:22.800
* Hold me tight, baby *

32:22.933 --> 32:24.833
[David] "The young women
will dance for joy,

32:24.967 --> 32:29.800
and the men, old and young,
will join in the celebration.

32:29.933 --> 32:34.067
I will turn
their mourning to joy.
I will comfort them."

32:34.133 --> 32:36.733
You know what that is, right?
That's scripture.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.333
It means get your butt out there
and enjoy yourself.

32:39.467 --> 32:41.633
Nah, man, I'm not a dancer.
I don't do that.

32:41.767 --> 32:43.967
Shyness is a sin.

32:44.100 --> 32:48.067
You're safe here. So, let it go
even for just an hour or two.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.433
Don't make me, man.
Don't make me--

32:49.567 --> 32:51.367
All right, you're making me
do this.

32:51.500 --> 32:52.900
-You ready?
-No, come on.

32:53.067 --> 32:56.500
-Hey, everyone! Everybody stop!
-[music stops]

32:56.633 --> 33:00.867
This is Jacob.
He lives across the street.

33:01.067 --> 33:03.767
And I could tell he's a real
good guy.

33:03.900 --> 33:07.367
So, who here wants to be
his friend?

33:07.500 --> 33:10.567
[all chuckling]

33:12.633 --> 33:15.767
-[whispering]
That's a lot of people.
-It sure is.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.100
You gotta let it go.

33:18.233 --> 33:19.767
-[chuckles]
-You gotta let it go.

33:19.900 --> 33:23.067
-Come on.
-I promise you,
you'll have a good time.

33:23.133 --> 33:25.733
-Here we go.
-[music resumes]

33:31.767 --> 33:35.467
Come on, Jacob!

33:35.600 --> 33:37.933
* I think I'm in love *

33:38.067 --> 33:41.900
* Love, love *

33:42.067 --> 33:44.067
* It's gotta be love *

33:44.200 --> 33:48.067
* Love, love *

33:48.167 --> 33:50.200
* I think I'm in love *

33:50.333 --> 33:53.567
* Love, love *

33:59.333 --> 34:00.767
[door closes]

34:00.900 --> 34:02.333
[Carol] You're home late.

34:02.467 --> 34:05.067
Yeah, I had some drinks
after work.

34:08.533 --> 34:10.333
Are you okay?

34:10.467 --> 34:11.500
I'm fine.

34:11.633 --> 34:14.067
You don't seem fine, Gary.

34:18.733 --> 34:21.400
He was right.

34:21.533 --> 34:23.067
-Who was right?
-Mitch.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.133
He's right.
I'm no better than him.

34:26.267 --> 34:28.467
What are you talking about?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.067
Sperryville.

34:35.533 --> 34:41.933
There was a guy.
He had his ex-wife
and his kid at gunpoint.

34:43.833 --> 34:48.567
I must've talked to this man
for 13 hours.

34:48.700 --> 34:53.700
And then I tricked him
into stepping outside
so we could kill him.

34:53.833 --> 34:58.500
And we killed him.
We shot him right in the neck.

34:58.633 --> 35:02.067
He looked so confused
to be dying.

35:02.167 --> 35:06.067
And the worst part is...

35:06.200 --> 35:07.933
I didn't feel anything.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.800
Nothing at all.

35:24.767 --> 35:29.067
My fifth child
almost died at birth.

35:29.133 --> 35:31.567
He was rendered
blind and disabled,

35:31.700 --> 35:35.900
and to be honest, it broke me.

35:40.367 --> 35:42.967
You know what a messiah is?

35:43.100 --> 35:44.867
Like Jesus?

35:46.533 --> 35:48.500
Messiah means "anointed one."

35:48.633 --> 35:53.533
The Hebrew word it comes from
means "anyone who turns
your eyes to God."

35:53.667 --> 35:57.500
-Okay.
-When I met David...

35:57.633 --> 36:01.833
he told me, "Your son, Jamie...

36:01.967 --> 36:03.500
he's your messiah.

36:03.633 --> 36:08.200
He has turned your eyes to God.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.667
This disabled child of yours
is the greatest gift
you've ever known,

36:12.800 --> 36:15.567
and you're the blind one
if you can't see it."

36:17.900 --> 36:19.600
Thank you, Wayne.

36:22.067 --> 36:27.633
Jacob, your mother's suffering
has opened your eyes to God.

36:30.133 --> 36:33.367
Tell me, if she were given
the choice...

36:33.500 --> 36:35.867
if God came to her...

36:36.067 --> 36:38.433
and gave her the option
that she could suffer terribly,

36:38.567 --> 36:43.933
but the result would be
that her baby boy would find
a deeper way of life...

36:45.800 --> 36:48.233
do you think she would've chosen
this suffering?

36:54.833 --> 36:57.600
-I don't know.
-Jacob, your mother...

36:57.733 --> 36:59.900
she's your messiah.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.800
Jacob...

37:19.967 --> 37:21.933
Do you have a gun on you?

37:22.067 --> 37:26.633
[suspenseful music playing]

37:26.767 --> 37:29.300
[chuckles]

37:29.433 --> 37:34.667
Yeah. I totally forgot
that I had it on me. [chuckles]

37:34.800 --> 37:36.333
Give it to me.

37:46.267 --> 37:49.733
Why would you bring a gun
to a wedding?

37:49.867 --> 37:52.700
I just got it recently
at a gun show.

37:52.833 --> 37:55.167
Empty this mag, Wayne.

38:00.400 --> 38:05.367
No, you didn't.
You didn't get this
at a gun show.

38:05.500 --> 38:09.733
This trigger's been modified.
It's illegal.

38:16.133 --> 38:21.267
Don't you ever bring
something like this...

38:21.400 --> 38:23.067
around here again.

38:40.567 --> 38:44.200
That was kind of a nice day,
wasn't it?

38:44.333 --> 38:46.500
Yeah.

38:46.633 --> 38:50.067
The best I ever had.

38:50.200 --> 38:50.833
Me too.

38:50.967 --> 38:52.467
[both chuckle]

38:58.467 --> 39:01.533
-[footsteps approaching]
-[David] Hey, guys.

39:04.233 --> 39:07.600
I wanna thank you for
what you did today.

39:07.733 --> 39:10.200
You helped this family.

39:10.333 --> 39:11.667
Both of you.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.633
Sure.

39:13.767 --> 39:16.167
But you know the rules.

39:16.300 --> 39:18.667
No men allowed
up in the women's quarters.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.967
Right, sorry.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.233
Son of a bitch.

39:52.367 --> 39:54.100
-This could ruin everything.
-No, we're gonna figure it out.

39:54.233 --> 39:56.133
You were brought in to control
this shit!

39:56.267 --> 39:58.333
-You can't even control
a local newspaper!
-If we--

39:58.467 --> 40:00.800
I don't want to hear it!
Now, they'll know
something's up!

40:00.933 --> 40:02.933
This could blow the element
of surprise!

40:23.033 --> 40:25.367
Phil, it's Ed.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.800
Gear everyone up.

40:53.667 --> 40:55.400
Shit.

41:01.367 --> 41:04.067
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

41:04.200 --> 41:07.200
[chuckles]

41:07.333 --> 41:08.967
You look lost.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.567
Yeah. Uh, there doesn't seem
to be any street signs out here.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.433
-What you looking for?
-A place called Mount Carmel.

41:14.567 --> 41:18.900
-Uh, it says here it's on...
-Double EE Road.

41:19.067 --> 41:20.533
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I know the place.

41:20.667 --> 41:22.567
Great.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.067
-Something going on there?
-Oh!

41:42.567 --> 41:44.967
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[Nate] "Sinful Messiah."

41:45.100 --> 41:49.333
It's catchy. "If you're
a Branch Davidian, Christ lives
on a threadbare piece of land

41:49.467 --> 41:52.567
ten miles east of Waco
called Mount Carmel."

41:52.700 --> 41:56.633
"Married his legal wife
when she was 14."

41:56.767 --> 41:58.700
[shutter clicks]

41:58.833 --> 42:01.333
"Enjoys a beer now and then,
plays a mean guitar,
packs a 9mm Glock,

42:01.467 --> 42:03.367
keeps an arsenal
of military assault rifles,

42:03.500 --> 42:06.867
and willingly admits that
he is a sinner without equal."

42:07.067 --> 42:09.800
You know "messiah"
doesn't mean Jesus, right?

42:09.933 --> 42:11.967
-What's that?
-They're making him sound

42:12.100 --> 42:13.967
like David thinks
he's Jesus or something,
you know what I mean?

42:14.100 --> 42:17.567
-Oh, David?
-Yeah. What?

42:17.700 --> 42:21.700
-Is he getting in your head?
-Shut up!

42:21.833 --> 42:23.833
Okay, be back in a moment.

42:23.967 --> 42:27.300
All right, so gentlemen,
this raid is going down today.
Plans have changed.

42:27.433 --> 42:30.833
We need you
to go in there and make sure
they don't know we're coming.

42:38.433 --> 42:40.633
[Thibodeau] David?

42:40.767 --> 42:43.467
[David] Jacob.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.200
Come on in.

42:53.633 --> 42:55.267
-Next time.
-Hey, hey, I gotta go to work.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.900
Say goodbye to Daddy.

42:57.067 --> 42:59.867
-Be good. Be good for Mom.
-Say, "Goodbye, Dad."

43:00.067 --> 43:02.967
-Dad.
-Hmm?

43:03.100 --> 43:04.133
Where's David?

43:04.267 --> 43:05.633
So, what you reading there?

43:08.233 --> 43:09.733
You know what I'm reading.

43:12.867 --> 43:14.633
A bunch of lies.

43:18.300 --> 43:21.200
Hey, David.
There's a phone call for you.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.067
Not right now.

43:23.133 --> 43:26.767
It's important, David.
You need to take this call.

43:30.700 --> 43:32.167
Stay right here.

43:43.633 --> 43:46.600
-What is it?
-Something's going down.

43:46.733 --> 43:51.500
Some news guy
asked me directions here.
I saw a bunch of agents.

43:51.633 --> 43:55.633
-[David] Are you sure?
-Yeah. They're all suited up.

43:55.767 --> 43:58.600
They're coming, David,
right now.

44:12.700 --> 44:14.800
They're coming today,
aren't they?

44:23.367 --> 44:28.967
Uh... who's coming? [stammering]
I don't know what you're
talking about.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.400
I know who you are.

44:31.533 --> 44:33.933
And I know who you work for.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.633
I'm just a rancher.

44:40.067 --> 44:43.867
I figured if God
brought you to me,
who am I to turn you away?

44:44.067 --> 44:46.167
And I'd like to think...

44:46.300 --> 44:52.133
you've gotten to know
who we really are,
not what's in this garbage.

44:52.267 --> 44:55.267
And I know you have a job to do.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.433
But you can stop this.

45:09.333 --> 45:12.533
I'm sorry, but I-- I gotta go.

45:12.667 --> 45:16.333
Jacob, you have the power to
stop this.

45:16.467 --> 45:18.300
So, stop it!

45:52.167 --> 45:55.500
They know!
They know we're coming!
We gotta call it off!

45:55.633 --> 45:57.500
-Get Ed.
-Ed, Vasquez.

45:57.633 --> 45:59.700
Ed, they know.
They know we're coming.
You gotta call it off, man.

45:59.833 --> 46:01.433
-[Ed] Did you see any weapons?
-No.

46:01.567 --> 46:03.367
Was there a call to arms?

46:03.500 --> 46:07.067
Not that I saw.
Ed, you gotta call it off.
They know we're coming.

46:10.100 --> 46:12.267
Ed? Ed. Ed!

46:12.400 --> 46:14.333
They know. Ed, they know.

46:14.467 --> 46:15.933
Ed.

46:21.333 --> 46:24.067
[knocking]

46:24.167 --> 46:25.833
-Hey.
-Hey.

46:25.967 --> 46:29.300
So, there may be some cops
coming here for David.

46:29.433 --> 46:32.067
And there's a chance
we'll all be asked to leave
the property.

46:32.133 --> 46:35.667
So, you might wanna,
I don't know, put some things
together, just in case.

46:38.467 --> 46:39.733
Will you hold her?

46:47.467 --> 46:49.533
[helicopter whirring]

47:31.300 --> 47:33.933
[engine starts]

47:46.567 --> 47:49.433
[tires screeching]

47:51.100 --> 47:52.233
Stop!

47:52.367 --> 47:54.700
They know you're coming! Stop!

47:54.833 --> 47:57.467
Hey, they know you're coming!

47:59.800 --> 48:03.767
Stop! They know you're coming!
They know you're coming!

48:03.900 --> 48:05.133
Stop!
