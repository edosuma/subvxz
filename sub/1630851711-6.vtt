00:01.965 --> 00:04.000
I want to be
regular off stage.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.517
You're saying I'm --
A stale Muffin.

00:05.517 --> 00:06.793
I slipped
and called you "Dad."

00:06.793 --> 00:07.931
Is that cool, Dad?

00:07.931 --> 00:09.241
Jill's in a great place.

00:09.241 --> 00:10.517
She is blossoming.

00:10.517 --> 00:11.965
Who are you?

00:11.965 --> 00:14.448
I'm your mother.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.172
Fivi. Fivio Foreign.

00:16.172 --> 00:18.000
Call me whatever you want,
just -- just call me.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.241
Look, we can't lose.

00:19.241 --> 00:22.344
Even if we all fall into a hole,
we got each other.

00:22.344 --> 00:25.310
We won.

00:37.517 --> 00:39.586
Yo, we were flawless!

00:39.586 --> 00:41.379
When Valeria
whipped her hair,

00:41.379 --> 00:42.862
Will Smith
damn near fainted!

00:42.862 --> 00:44.655
Hey, yo,
my phone is blowing up.

00:44.655 --> 00:46.862
They want us for
"Saturday Night Live," baby!

00:46.862 --> 00:48.689
- Oh, my God!

00:48.689 --> 00:50.724
Oh, my God.
There is no stopping us!

00:50.724 --> 00:52.137
Come on, bring it in.

00:52.137 --> 00:53.517
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

00:53.517 --> 00:55.068
Queens!

01:22.931 --> 01:25.103
These women are not

01:32.413 --> 01:35.379

redemption and family.

01:35.379 --> 01:38.137
I'm focusing on the time
we have,

01:38.137 --> 01:39.896
not the time we lost.

01:50.896 --> 01:52.931
Hold up.

01:52.931 --> 01:54.137
I can't.

01:54.137 --> 01:55.517

02:40.310 --> 02:41.241
Ma?

02:41.241 --> 02:42.034
Yeah.

02:42.034 --> 02:43.896
What were you
listening to?

02:43.896 --> 02:45.103
Nothing.

02:45.103 --> 02:47.000
Mm. Mm.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.241
We're out of waffles.

02:48.241 --> 02:50.517
Okay.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.655
Mom?
Hmm?

02:52.655 --> 02:55.206
Did you do stuff
with Fivio Foreign?

02:57.896 --> 03:01.137
I followed your recipe
to a "T."

03:01.137 --> 03:02.137
Hmm.

03:02.137 --> 03:03.172
It's pretty good,
right?

03:03.172 --> 03:05.275
Hmm.

03:05.275 --> 03:06.448
Too much salt?

03:06.448 --> 03:07.655
It's terrible, isn't it?

03:07.655 --> 03:09.724
I've eaten worse --
I think.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.724
This was a nice gesture.

03:15.724 --> 03:17.896
Thank you.

03:17.896 --> 03:19.655
I got you something.

03:27.310 --> 03:29.000
These aren't
real diamonds.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.551
Gross.

03:30.551 --> 03:32.068
I can't.

03:32.068 --> 03:33.241
Stop.

03:33.241 --> 03:35.517
You can.

03:35.517 --> 03:39.482
I've always wanted to buy
my mom something...nice,

03:39.482 --> 03:42.344
and...now I get to.

03:43.758 --> 03:46.379
I owe you
an explanation.

03:46.379 --> 03:49.137
Yes, and I want
to know everything.

03:49.137 --> 03:50.310
But it can wait.

03:59.482 --> 04:01.241
I'm enjoying this.

04:03.862 --> 04:05.827
Let me make us
something edible, huh?

04:19.620 --> 04:21.793
Hopefully, now everyone
can move forward.

04:23.551 --> 04:24.827
Can I have a minute
with Jill?

04:24.827 --> 04:26.068
Of course.

04:36.793 --> 04:38.103
I'm sorry.

04:40.137 --> 04:43.517
Loving you as much as
I do isn't an excuse
for how I behaved.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.034
I understand.

04:46.034 --> 04:47.275
But thank you.

04:49.034 --> 04:50.862
Just...

04:50.862 --> 04:52.172
do me one favor.

04:53.931 --> 04:56.241
You're a good person.

04:56.241 --> 04:58.310
Don't change too much.

05:17.206 --> 05:19.586
Yo.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.172
You gave Jojo
your chain?

05:22.172 --> 05:24.793
She told you?

05:24.793 --> 05:26.344
She did.

05:28.413 --> 05:30.896
How come I always feel
like I walked into a scene

05:30.896 --> 05:32.620
from "The Notebook"
when you two are together?

05:34.551 --> 05:37.275
Listen, we have to capitalize
on the heat from the AMAs.

05:37.275 --> 05:39.586
Yes, it's definitely time
we drop our new single

05:39.586 --> 05:40.620
on the world, y'all --

05:40.620 --> 05:42.137
obliterate
the patriarchy.

05:42.137 --> 05:43.758
Yo, the song is so dope.

05:43.758 --> 05:45.551
I'm proud of us.
It's a real statement.

05:45.551 --> 05:47.137
Gotta do a video, too.

05:47.137 --> 05:49.689
And "Behind the Video" wants us
to shoot a documentary.

05:49.689 --> 05:51.379
I'm talking a new song,
a video,

05:51.379 --> 05:53.137
and a BTS doc drop
on the same day.

05:53.137 --> 05:55.551
Wait, we gotta have cameras
following us 24/7?

05:55.551 --> 05:57.344
Well, Alicia says
content is king.

05:58.586 --> 06:00.620
My kids found out about me
and Fivio Foreign.

06:00.620 --> 06:01.931
Bad content.

06:01.931 --> 06:03.137
Their dad is dead.

06:03.137 --> 06:05.724
Their mom is home half as much
as she used to be.

06:05.724 --> 06:07.517
I have to ease them
into this.

06:07.517 --> 06:09.000
Not put myself
on "The Real World."

06:09.000 --> 06:11.344
Welcome to being a single mom
with a career in music.

06:11.344 --> 06:12.931
We present the image
we want to sell --

06:12.931 --> 06:14.482
that's it. Unified.

06:14.482 --> 06:16.931
It feels like it's all
right there for us, ladies.

06:16.931 --> 06:19.172
For real,
and y'all know Valeria is down.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.310
Psh, okay.

06:21.344 --> 06:22.275
Alright, bet.

06:22.275 --> 06:23.517
Let's ride.
Yay!

06:24.586 --> 06:25.827
Ey yo, Muffin just sent
her verse

06:25.827 --> 06:26.931
for the new single.

06:26.931 --> 06:28.241
Let's check it out.

06:28.241 --> 06:29.689
Oh, just in time.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.137
I was cooking
for my mom.

06:31.137 --> 06:33.965
I love hearing a sentence
I never thought I would hear.

06:33.965 --> 06:36.206
What's her explanation?
Explanation?

06:36.206 --> 06:38.793
For why she left baby Valeria
on a New York street.

06:38.793 --> 06:40.275
We haven't gotten
into it.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.517
That's not even
my question.

06:41.517 --> 06:43.137
I'm like, "Why this chick
show up now?"

06:43.137 --> 06:46.068
Damn! Can I be happy
for a minute?

06:46.068 --> 06:47.275
I mean, it's dope
you're kicking it,

06:47.275 --> 06:48.931
but in my experience,
when family shows up

06:48.931 --> 06:50.310
out of the blue,
they want --

06:50.310 --> 06:51.586
Money.
- Money.
- Money.

06:52.931 --> 06:54.793
I gave her a diamond necklace
this morning

06:54.793 --> 06:57.862
that I practically had
to force around her neck.

06:57.862 --> 07:00.862
Look, it's nice
to see you so open, but --

07:00.862 --> 07:02.344
- Protect yourself.
- Mm.

07:02.344 --> 07:03.586
That's all.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.620
Well, let's see
what Muffin's got.

07:34.379 --> 07:36.413
That'll work.

07:36.413 --> 07:37.655
Will that work?

07:37.655 --> 07:39.379
For sure, but, uh...

07:39.379 --> 07:40.586
What?

07:40.586 --> 07:42.586
Muffin's my client,
so I hate to do this,

07:42.586 --> 07:43.931
but I wouldn't be doing right
by y'all

07:43.931 --> 07:45.344
if I didn't mention
that Lady London

07:45.344 --> 07:47.241
submitted a verse, too --
unsolicited.

07:47.241 --> 07:49.896
Lady London wants to collab
with <i>us?</i>

07:49.896 --> 07:51.724
She is <i>it</i> right now.

07:51.724 --> 07:52.793
It doesn't matter.

07:52.793 --> 07:54.379
We wouldn't be here
without Muffin.

07:54.379 --> 07:56.620
Facts.
So, we're not even gonna
give it a listen?

07:56.620 --> 07:58.655
Jill, would you talk
some sense into V?

07:58.655 --> 08:00.034
It's not always
about business.

08:00.034 --> 08:02.137
It's <i>not</i> always
about business.

08:02.137 --> 08:03.517
But this is.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.413
I mean,
let's just keep it real.

08:05.413 --> 08:07.413
Muffin has kinda
fallen off.

08:07.413 --> 08:08.517
I mean,
she went to rehab.

08:08.517 --> 08:10.724
And I empathize,
Lord knows, but --

08:10.724 --> 08:12.448
We need to do
what it takes.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.827
We want what we threw away
20 years ago -- a world tour.

08:15.827 --> 08:17.379
Yes!
Look, I'm late.

08:17.379 --> 08:19.275
I gotta pick up Olivia
from dance.

08:19.275 --> 08:22.344
Listen if you want,
but it's gotta be Muffin.

08:23.344 --> 08:25.000
We should just listen
anyway.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.241
Could be a non-factor.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.793
Okay, who's telling Muffin
she's out?

08:50.793 --> 08:52.931
Look, I picked her up
from rehab, y'all.

08:52.931 --> 08:55.275
I know what kind of person
she's trying to be.

08:55.275 --> 08:56.931
I mean,
her video flopped.

08:56.931 --> 08:59.689
She had a unicorn horn planted
in her head to stay relevant.

08:59.689 --> 09:02.344
I want no part of being
the reason she has a relapse.

09:02.344 --> 09:04.724
Then let's vote.
Democracy and all that.

09:04.724 --> 09:06.448
I mean, we know Bree is riding
with Muffin.

09:06.448 --> 09:07.724
Well, y'all know
where I'm at.

09:07.724 --> 09:08.965
I stay loyal.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.655
Lady London, her verse
is objectively better.

09:12.655 --> 09:14.172
When I'm with y'all,

09:14.172 --> 09:16.275
I have to think about
what's best for you.

09:16.275 --> 09:17.965
London's the smart move
right now.

09:17.965 --> 09:20.448
Jill, you're cool with stabbing
your friend in the back?

09:20.448 --> 09:22.793
You geriatric-ass traitors!

09:22.793 --> 09:24.482
Well, we wanted
to tell you in person.

09:24.482 --> 09:26.586
Does that make you
a good person, Jill?

09:26.586 --> 09:28.482
You have every right
to be pissed.

09:28.482 --> 09:29.689
I'm pissed.

09:29.689 --> 09:31.172
This wasn't my call,
Muffin.

09:31.172 --> 09:32.482
We voted.

09:32.482 --> 09:34.448
3 to 2.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.000
And you're one
of the three?

09:38.068 --> 09:40.551
We will get your career
back on track -- on my family.

09:40.551 --> 09:42.586
Mm-hmm.

09:52.517 --> 09:54.103
I guess
this is who you are now.

09:59.241 --> 10:00.793
Lauren.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.517
Is it true
the divorce is finalized?

10:07.517 --> 10:08.793
That's a private matter.

10:08.793 --> 10:10.689
U-Um, how does it feel to be
the most famous gay

10:10.689 --> 10:12.172
on the planet
right now?

10:12.172 --> 10:13.862
I love my life.

10:13.862 --> 10:15.448
I love you.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.034
If I knew I'd get
this much attention,

10:17.034 --> 10:19.448
I would have said I was gay
ages ago.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.586
They were washed!

10:26.586 --> 10:28.931
I put them bitches
back on the map!

10:28.931 --> 10:31.344
And Jill --
Jill, of all people --

10:31.344 --> 10:33.241
My ham leg is missing.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.034
It is from Iberia.

10:37.034 --> 10:40.517
Yo, my heart been, like,
sucked out with a straw!

10:40.517 --> 10:41.965
Y'all been my family
since middle school,

10:41.965 --> 10:44.482
and it's like
you just don't even care

10:44.482 --> 10:46.275
how they betrayed me --

10:46.275 --> 10:48.206
and the fact that my career
is in the dumpster!

10:48.206 --> 10:49.965
You're wrong.
We are very aware

10:49.965 --> 10:52.275
how your career
is now a dumpster fire.

10:52.275 --> 10:53.655
Hmm.
And frankly,
we're concerned

10:53.655 --> 10:54.931
you don't have a plan
for us.

10:54.931 --> 10:57.862
Those nasty-bitch Queens
went abracadabra after 20 years,

10:57.862 --> 11:00.034
came back rapping
about divorce and maxi pads,

11:00.034 --> 11:01.310
and now they're back on top.

11:01.310 --> 11:03.068
What's <i>our</i> next move,
Muff?

11:03.068 --> 11:05.103
We need you
to get transformational.

11:09.482 --> 11:11.586
Yeah.

11:11.586 --> 11:12.724
Yeah.

11:16.413 --> 11:17.655
Eric.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.172
I need to sit down
with the label.

11:20.793 --> 11:23.172
You've barely touched
your food.

11:26.275 --> 11:29.137
We should, um...

11:30.896 --> 11:32.758
It's time to talk.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.448
What's this?

11:39.448 --> 11:40.862
$100,000.

11:40.862 --> 11:44.034
If you're here for money,
there it is.

11:44.034 --> 11:45.827
Take it and go.

11:47.655 --> 11:49.551
This is my fault.

11:49.551 --> 11:51.931
I didn't know how you'd react
to me showing up,

11:51.931 --> 11:55.482
but y-you made it easy on me
when you didn't have to.

11:56.620 --> 11:59.620
I came to Queens
from Puerto Rico with my dad.

11:59.620 --> 12:01.551
My mom died
when I was young.

12:01.551 --> 12:03.379
I didn't want to come.

12:03.379 --> 12:05.896
But then I fell in love
with New York.

12:05.896 --> 12:08.482
And I fell in love
with a boy.

12:08.482 --> 12:09.965
Javier.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.551
He had a goatee.

12:11.551 --> 12:14.862
I thought he was cute.

12:14.862 --> 12:17.724
And then I was 19
and pregnant.

12:17.724 --> 12:19.827
And then I was 19
and married.

12:22.620 --> 12:25.620
The first time Javi choked me
until I passed out,

12:25.620 --> 12:27.103
I fought back.

12:27.103 --> 12:29.068
That was a mistake,

12:29.068 --> 12:30.482
and then I thought,

12:30.482 --> 12:33.620
"It's only a matter of time
before he hurt you."

12:33.620 --> 12:35.344
See, I could take it --

12:35.344 --> 12:36.827
o-or live with it,
I guess --

12:36.827 --> 12:38.517
but --

12:38.517 --> 12:40.379
but you --

12:40.379 --> 12:42.068
you were a baby.

12:42.068 --> 12:46.068
This precious soul who was
the only reason, honestly,

12:46.068 --> 12:49.310
why I --
I didn't kill myself.

12:51.103 --> 12:56.482
I couldn't stomach the thought
of him hurting you.

12:56.482 --> 12:59.137
The day I took you
to the shelter,

12:59.137 --> 13:01.793
I put the shade down
on the bassinet,

13:01.793 --> 13:05.965
because I knew
that if I looked at you,

13:05.965 --> 13:09.724
I couldn't do the thing
that I knew I needed to do.

13:09.724 --> 13:11.137
I went back to Puerto Rico

13:11.137 --> 13:14.103
and pretended like my life
in New York never happened.

13:14.103 --> 13:17.586
And I saw you on TV
over the years.

13:19.448 --> 13:22.482
And it helped me feel better
about abandoning you.

13:31.689 --> 13:35.379
So I'll go --
<i>if</i> that's what you want.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.379
But not because
you gave me $100,000.

13:41.448 --> 13:42.586
Can I...

13:44.965 --> 13:46.344
...hug you?

13:47.931 --> 13:49.482
Yes.

13:55.931 --> 13:57.241
Don't ever let go.

13:57.241 --> 13:58.931
I won't.

13:58.931 --> 14:00.517
I can't.

14:12.793 --> 14:14.241
You could move.

14:15.965 --> 14:18.310
You could also
help me clean.

14:18.310 --> 14:20.103
I'm good.

14:22.827 --> 14:24.448
Hello? Ms. Pat?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.965
Hey, you almost here?

14:26.965 --> 14:28.448
I--

14:28.448 --> 14:29.517
I've gotta get to work.

14:29.517 --> 14:30.862
My call time's --

14:33.344 --> 14:35.103
Okay, yeah.

14:35.103 --> 14:37.379
Um, feel better.

14:41.862 --> 14:43.793
Are you uncomfortable?

14:43.793 --> 14:45.103
Yes.

14:45.103 --> 14:47.275
Hey, we are just here
to document

14:47.275 --> 14:50.000
this special moment
of the first Queens music video.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.275
There is nothing
to worry about, okay?

14:52.275 --> 14:53.517
No need to be extra.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.827
I'm ready
to be extra-extra.

14:55.827 --> 14:58.551
<i>Todos, esta es mi mama.</i>

14:58.551 --> 14:59.931
This is my mother.

14:59.931 --> 15:02.379
-  It's really nice
to meet you.
-  Oh.

15:02.379 --> 15:05.551
I have heard so much
about you.

15:05.551 --> 15:06.931
These cameras
are recording?

15:06.931 --> 15:08.379
Pretend we're not here.

15:08.379 --> 15:09.517
You good?

15:09.517 --> 15:10.724
All good.

15:10.724 --> 15:13.689
Oh, sorry. I know
I'm the last to arrive.

15:13.689 --> 15:15.413
No, you're not, actually --
for once.

15:15.413 --> 15:17.137
Yeah,
Bree's running late.

15:17.137 --> 15:18.793
Nanny called in sick.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.068
She's bringing the kids.

15:21.068 --> 15:22.482
This is Rodrigo Canales,

15:22.482 --> 15:24.620
the hottest music-video director
in the game.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.758
I'm here
to support you ladies,

15:26.758 --> 15:28.620
make sure you feel good
and safe.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.344
I'm a huge fan.

15:30.344 --> 15:32.413
And, Naomi, I actually saw you
perform a solo show

15:32.413 --> 15:33.482
at Pappy and Harriet's.

15:33.482 --> 15:35.068
In Pioneertown?

15:35.068 --> 15:37.000
There were only
like 12 people at that show.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.275
I was one of them.

15:38.275 --> 15:40.206
It was worth the trip.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.310
I-I'm humbled to be a small part
of your comeback story,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.827
so we'll shoot for two days
with the Queens

15:45.827 --> 15:48.827
and a final day with you
and Lady London.

15:48.827 --> 15:51.344
Now, the first step
to feeling good

15:51.344 --> 15:52.344
is looking good,

15:52.344 --> 15:54.344
which...should be easy.

15:55.448 --> 15:57.034
So, let's get you
in hair and makeup.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.000
Did you see the way
he was looking at Naomi?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
- Oh, my --
- Like a damn snack.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.689
He is fine -- like if
Derek Jeter was a sherpa.

16:09.103 --> 16:11.689
V, your mom must be
losing her mind.

16:11.689 --> 16:13.034
I'm just glad
she could come.

16:13.034 --> 16:14.517
I hope she's proud of me.

16:14.517 --> 16:15.620
Are you kidding me?

16:15.620 --> 16:16.793
Of course she is.

16:22.103 --> 16:23.448
What?

16:23.448 --> 16:25.241
<i>If I knew I'd get </i>
this much attention,

16:25.241 --> 16:27.758
<i>I would have said I was gay </i>
ages ago.

16:27.758 --> 16:29.551
So, everyone on the Internet
thinks --

16:29.551 --> 16:31.413
Thinks you came out
for a come-up.

16:31.413 --> 16:33.137
That was fast.
You went from queer icon

16:33.137 --> 16:35.896
to public enemy number one
in five months.

16:35.896 --> 16:38.068
Am I...

16:38.068 --> 16:39.344
canceled?

16:42.896 --> 16:45.482
The fact that anyone
could even think

16:45.482 --> 16:49.241
I would use my sexuality
to advance my career,

16:49.241 --> 16:51.862
it's really hurtful.

16:51.862 --> 16:53.689
I mean, they don't know
what I've been through.

16:53.689 --> 16:56.137
W-- Y-You certainly
haven't shied away

16:56.137 --> 16:57.931
from the cameras
since coming out.

16:57.931 --> 17:02.000
Because I'm finally free
to be myself.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.172
You know, we are so thirsty to
take people down in this country

17:05.172 --> 17:07.413
that we will literally
twist their words

17:07.413 --> 17:08.758
to create a villain.

17:08.758 --> 17:11.344
So, you are
fighting back?

17:20.517 --> 17:21.310
What are you doing?

17:21.310 --> 17:22.344
Saving you.

17:22.344 --> 17:24.034
You can't win
against Twitter trolls.

17:24.034 --> 17:25.965
The people inside this phone
will move on

17:25.965 --> 17:27.965
when John Oliver tells them
who to hate next.

17:27.965 --> 17:30.310
Lay down, get dragged,
get up,

17:30.310 --> 17:32.551
and brace yourself
to do it all over again.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.793
That's the price of fame
in 2021.

17:37.172 --> 17:39.896
Don't give the trolls
any more fuel.

17:47.517 --> 17:48.586
Ooh, thank you, Trent.

17:48.586 --> 17:49.620
Yeah.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
What the hell?!

18:07.000 --> 18:07.827
Come back here!

18:07.827 --> 18:09.172
Get back here right now!

18:10.586 --> 18:12.172
Oh, my God.

18:14.862 --> 18:16.103
You're supposed to be
watching them,

18:16.103 --> 18:17.551
and you're laughing?

18:17.551 --> 18:18.620
When are we going home?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.034
When I'm done
with work.

18:20.034 --> 18:22.793
My soccer match
is at 4:00.

18:22.793 --> 18:25.482
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
You're gonna have
to skip this one.

18:25.482 --> 18:26.827
It's the semis.

18:26.827 --> 18:28.068
Okay, let me see
if Gary's parents

18:28.068 --> 18:30.103
can come pick you up,
okay?

18:30.103 --> 18:31.965
We're ready to roll
when you are.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.137
Yeah.

18:37.137 --> 18:39.517
Just go.
I'm really sorry.

18:42.310 --> 18:44.482
Yeah, keep being a slut.

18:48.724 --> 18:49.724
What did you just say?!

18:49.724 --> 18:50.758
It's what my friends say

18:50.758 --> 18:52.137
because of the whole
Fivio Foreign thing.

18:52.137 --> 18:54.827
That's none of their business,
or yours --

18:54.827 --> 18:57.034
and apologize right now
for even thinking those words

18:57.034 --> 18:59.310
about your mother
before you get yourself hurt.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.310
Whatever.

19:00.310 --> 19:01.172
Boy, if you don't --

19:01.172 --> 19:03.448
They really need you
on set.

19:05.551 --> 19:07.172
I'mma deal with you later.

19:25.103 --> 19:26.586
Cut!

19:26.586 --> 19:28.862
Cut! Cut!
I'm sorry, I will get it.

19:28.862 --> 19:29.931
Let's take five.

19:29.931 --> 19:31.103
Oh, no, I'm good.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.896
I actually want to speak
with Naomi.

19:32.896 --> 19:34.275
Oh, okay.

19:36.034 --> 19:37.827
Does something
not look right?

19:37.827 --> 19:39.655
Listen, don't hate me
for saying this,

19:39.655 --> 19:43.137
but, Naomi, the camera's
gonna find you.

19:43.137 --> 19:44.448
Whether you hide in the back
or not,

19:44.448 --> 19:47.206
the camera
finds you because...

19:47.206 --> 19:50.103
someone like you
is impossible to hide.

19:50.103 --> 19:52.689
So, stop trying.

19:52.689 --> 19:53.965
That's all.

19:57.448 --> 19:58.724
You didn't take
my advice.

19:58.724 --> 20:00.689
My integrity
is on the line.

20:00.689 --> 20:02.689
You're lying with pigs.
Trust.

20:02.689 --> 20:03.896
Okay, let's run it back.

20:03.896 --> 20:05.482
This time, we'll start
with Naomi's verse.

20:05.482 --> 20:07.448
- Hey, Layton.

20:10.344 --> 20:11.896
Action.

20:24.931 --> 20:26.620
Yes, Naomi!

20:26.620 --> 20:28.103
You are the queen!

20:28.103 --> 20:30.241
Good job, baby!

20:34.931 --> 20:36.689
Sure you want
to do this?

20:36.689 --> 20:38.206
It's the only thing
that feels right.

20:39.931 --> 20:40.931
Whew.

20:41.965 --> 20:44.137
Lil Muffin is done
recording music.

20:44.137 --> 20:46.862
Contractually, you owe us
one more album,

20:46.862 --> 20:49.413
but we want to be in the
Lil Muffin business long-term.

20:49.413 --> 20:51.275
Lil Muffin business
went "poof."

20:51.275 --> 20:52.344
Eric?

20:52.344 --> 20:53.482
Listen to the woman.

20:53.482 --> 20:56.344
Your "vacation"
stalled our momentum,

20:56.344 --> 20:57.620
but we can get it back.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.413
Lil Muffin is a character
I grew out of myself.

21:00.413 --> 21:02.034
She's weird.

21:02.034 --> 21:04.896
She's all
the little quirks I built

21:04.896 --> 21:06.241
from taking sick days
from school

21:06.241 --> 21:07.724
because I was bullied.

21:07.724 --> 21:10.000
Watching hours and hours
of "Naruto"

21:10.000 --> 21:11.931
underneath
a Nicki Minaj poster.

21:11.931 --> 21:14.896
But Muffin has morphed
into something else.

21:14.896 --> 21:18.965
And getting clean,
buying my own ham...

21:20.655 --> 21:23.448
I have to represent
who I am <i>now.</i>

21:23.448 --> 21:25.103
That isn't Muffin.

21:26.793 --> 21:30.034
I want to record
my next album as Lauren.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.310
When you first
signed me,

21:32.310 --> 21:36.620
you said that
you trusted my vision.

21:38.689 --> 21:41.689
I'm asking you to trust me
one more time.

21:47.965 --> 21:50.068
I've gotta run this
up to the top.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.793
But let's make
our first Lauren album.

22:03.896 --> 22:07.655
To serenity, peace,
and courage!

22:09.206 --> 22:11.241
Yes, queen!
Make that cake!

22:11.241 --> 22:13.896
We still livin'!
Ham all day!

22:13.896 --> 22:15.517
I can't believe
they went for it!

22:15.517 --> 22:17.103
What you doin'
with your wigs?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.586
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

22:20.586 --> 22:23.344
Yo, E-Roc!
We back!

22:23.344 --> 22:25.103
<i>Those assholes dropped us.</i>

22:25.103 --> 22:27.517
The label is voiding
your contract.

22:27.517 --> 22:28.827
They can do that?

22:28.827 --> 22:30.896
They also want
to settle the bill.

22:30.896 --> 22:33.275
Bill? What I look like,
Destiny's Child?

22:33.275 --> 22:36.586
You owe 750 racks we were hoping
to make up on the next album.

22:38.551 --> 22:41.103
Okay, I can sell the house.
That's gotta be a couple millie.

22:41.103 --> 22:43.103
<i>Label owns the house.</i>

22:43.103 --> 22:43.965
<i>You pay rent.</i>

22:47.448 --> 22:48.310
Oh.

22:48.310 --> 22:49.310
<i>We'll figure this out.</i>

22:49.310 --> 22:51.413
Hang tight
and I will figure --

22:51.413 --> 22:52.862
figure something out.

23:00.689 --> 23:04.310
If you could, uh, rephrase
the question in your answer.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.000
"Mother gave me up
for adoption because..."

23:06.000 --> 23:07.275
Nah.

23:07.275 --> 23:08.758
Thanks, but, nah.

23:08.758 --> 23:10.172
If I say that,
you're gonna use it,

23:10.172 --> 23:11.344
and...

23:14.655 --> 23:16.586
...some things
don't need to be hyped.

23:16.586 --> 23:19.000
Well, what <i>would</i> you like
to say about your mother

23:19.000 --> 23:21.862
showing back up in your life
after all these years?

23:21.862 --> 23:24.482
My mother showing back up
in my life

23:24.482 --> 23:27.482
is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

23:27.482 --> 23:30.310
Being with her makes me
a better person.

23:30.310 --> 23:33.241
I'm focusing on the time
we have,

23:33.241 --> 23:34.896
not the time we lost.

23:38.862 --> 23:40.000
Like that.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.137
Yeah, mm-hmm,
but better.

23:43.344 --> 23:45.206
And, no, actually.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.448
You make it look so easy --

23:47.448 --> 23:49.137
like how I play
the air guitar.

23:51.379 --> 23:55.517
You got me all nervous,
sitting here with a legend.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.862
I'm not worthy.

23:56.862 --> 23:58.517
No, you are not.

23:58.517 --> 24:01.517
But we gonna get this chord
right or die trying, okay?

24:01.517 --> 24:02.517
Can I help?

24:06.482 --> 24:07.896
Yeah.

24:14.241 --> 24:15.586
Okay, now,
if you can't hit that,

24:15.586 --> 24:17.000
I can't help you.

24:20.172 --> 24:21.103
Look at that.

24:22.517 --> 24:23.724
Hey.

24:27.448 --> 24:28.965
Hey, what's up?

24:28.965 --> 24:31.586
Hey, just wondering
why the shoot hasn't started.

24:31.586 --> 24:33.000
We good?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.413
Just waiting for second unit
to finish getting some B-roll.

24:35.413 --> 24:36.655
Then we'll start.

24:36.655 --> 24:38.413
Sound good to you,
boss?

24:38.413 --> 24:40.586
Cool.

24:40.586 --> 24:41.724
Cool.

24:41.724 --> 24:43.896
Cool.

24:43.896 --> 24:46.137
Is everybody...cool?

24:47.310 --> 24:48.758
Hey, is Lady London here
for her fitting?

24:48.758 --> 24:50.551
I wanted to run some shots
by her.

24:50.551 --> 24:52.344
She'll be here
after lunch.

24:52.344 --> 24:53.413
Cool.

24:53.413 --> 24:56.000
Cool.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.517
See you out there, then.

24:57.517 --> 24:59.172
Cool.

25:00.310 --> 25:02.931
These kids have been
my entire life.

25:02.931 --> 25:05.620
I left school to be a mother,
and I've never regretted it.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.724
Now I'm back
to doing this thing I did

25:07.724 --> 25:09.344
before they were even born.

25:09.344 --> 25:10.931
And you might be
the first mother of five

25:10.931 --> 25:12.965
who is also
a hip-hop star.

25:12.965 --> 25:16.241
Uh, look, I am not trying
to make history.

25:16.241 --> 25:17.482
Life is hard enough.

25:17.482 --> 25:20.413
But I'm definitely glad
we get this comeback.

25:20.413 --> 25:22.689
It's been so good to be
with my girls --

25:22.689 --> 25:24.586
mentally, artistically.

25:24.586 --> 25:27.758
But it's been hard, too,

25:27.758 --> 25:31.586
because my kids have always had
their mom at home,

25:31.586 --> 25:33.344
and...

25:38.931 --> 25:40.896
Hold up.

25:40.896 --> 25:42.241
I can't do this.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.517
I can't.

25:44.517 --> 25:46.689
What the hell do you two
think you're doing?

25:51.482 --> 25:53.310
You, you, up.

25:58.620 --> 25:59.689
What the hell is wrong
with you?

25:59.689 --> 26:00.965
What the hell is wrong
with <i>you?</i>

26:00.965 --> 26:02.137
Excuse me?

26:02.137 --> 26:03.551
This isn't you.

26:03.551 --> 26:04.827
You're supposed
to be my mom.

26:04.827 --> 26:07.310
I am your mom.

26:07.310 --> 26:08.413
You're different.

26:08.413 --> 26:10.448
Everything's different!

26:21.137 --> 26:24.827
The last couple of months
have been...rough...

26:24.827 --> 26:26.827
for me, too.

26:26.827 --> 26:29.448
But you know it's up to me now
to keep clothes on our backs

26:29.448 --> 26:31.517
and food on our table,

26:31.517 --> 26:34.241
and this --
this is my job, baby,

26:34.241 --> 26:38.068
and I'm good at it
and I love it.

26:38.068 --> 26:40.241
You know I was a person
before you.

26:40.241 --> 26:42.275
Before you, before Daddy.

26:42.275 --> 26:44.000
I had a whole life,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.413
and I love being your mom,
James,

26:46.413 --> 26:49.551
but there's more to me
than that.

26:49.551 --> 26:52.241
Your whole life,
I took care of you kids,

26:52.241 --> 26:55.068
and the reason I could do that
is because Daddy went to work,

26:55.068 --> 26:58.931
but he's gone
and I need your help.

26:58.931 --> 27:00.068
Help how?

27:00.068 --> 27:01.896
Help with the others.

27:01.896 --> 27:05.241
Watching them,
looking after them,

27:05.241 --> 27:07.275
being strong for them.

27:07.275 --> 27:09.172
You know they look up to you now
to see how to act,

27:09.172 --> 27:13.000
especially because Daddy
isn't around.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.068
This is crazy and stupid,

27:16.068 --> 27:20.206
but this is the "man of the
house" speech in real life.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.586
That's not fair.

27:21.586 --> 27:23.413
It's not fair.

27:23.413 --> 27:25.310
None of this is fair,
but it's life,

27:25.310 --> 27:28.586
and it's how it's gonna
have to be.

27:29.793 --> 27:32.862
We'll get through it --
I promise.

27:32.862 --> 27:35.517
But we can only
do it together, okay?

27:37.379 --> 27:38.517
Okay.

27:38.517 --> 27:40.344
Okay?
Okay.

27:42.793 --> 27:44.965
Thanks for coming.

27:44.965 --> 27:45.965
I need help.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.206
Look, this isn't great,

27:47.206 --> 27:48.689
but it's not
a career-ender.

27:48.689 --> 27:50.344
What's done is done,
and now you just need someone

27:50.344 --> 27:51.724
who can vouch for you --

27:51.724 --> 27:54.310
combat the bad press
with a positive...

27:56.482 --> 27:58.068
What -- What is it?

27:58.068 --> 28:00.931
Did you assault someone?

28:02.689 --> 28:04.517
And where I come from,
bitches like you

28:04.517 --> 28:06.655
get beat down
for steppin' to me incorrect!

28:06.655 --> 28:09.241
It was completely unprofessional
on my part to approach,

28:09.241 --> 28:10.689
but...

28:10.689 --> 28:12.344
I thought she was flirting
with me, and...

28:13.965 --> 28:16.241
And I was young
and star-struck.

28:17.586 --> 28:19.034
You know, she could have --

28:19.034 --> 28:20.724
she could have just said no.

28:22.206 --> 28:24.586
But she put her hands on me.

28:24.586 --> 28:25.724
Called me a freak.

28:25.724 --> 28:28.068
She made me feel so small

28:28.068 --> 28:30.000
that I quit the business.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.724
I was depressed.

28:31.724 --> 28:33.172
I was ashamed.

28:33.172 --> 28:35.689
And it all came back
when I heard Jill

28:35.689 --> 28:38.448
being celebrated
as some kind of queer icon.

28:38.448 --> 28:40.137
Jill Da Thrill ruined my life.

28:41.068 --> 28:42.068
That was 20 years ago.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.448
You know
what that was about.

28:43.448 --> 28:45.344
Well, Jill, it doesn't matter
what we think.

28:45.344 --> 28:47.068
Everything we've worked for
is in jeopardy.

28:47.068 --> 28:48.827
This is not your fault,
but you have been acting

28:48.827 --> 28:50.413
mad saddidy lately.

28:50.413 --> 28:53.413
You guys want to pile on
or help me out of this mess?

28:53.413 --> 28:54.862
Lady London
dropped out.

28:54.862 --> 28:56.172
People say
she can't be

28:56.172 --> 28:58.586
associated with <i>us</i>
<i>right now.</i>

28:59.689 --> 29:01.827
So --
We're done.

29:08.827 --> 29:11.344
I mean,
do I think we're over?

29:11.344 --> 29:14.206
I mean, I think it's bad,
but, nah.

29:14.206 --> 29:15.275
It can't be.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.103
I-It's crazy we even got
back here

29:17.103 --> 29:20.206
after all we've been through
the past 20 years.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.517
We're resilient.

29:21.517 --> 29:22.620
We're women.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.482
We're queens.

29:24.482 --> 29:26.620
And, look, I've known Jill
a very long time,

29:26.620 --> 29:28.862
and she's <i>not</i>
<i>what they're saying.</i>

29:28.862 --> 29:31.413
So, do I think
she's gonna fix this?

29:31.413 --> 29:32.827
No doubt.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.172
No doubt.

29:36.896 --> 29:38.206
Now, what --

29:38.206 --> 29:40.862
and excuse me
for asking this --

29:40.862 --> 29:43.413
is going on
with you and Rodrigo?

29:43.413 --> 29:44.517
Nothing.

29:46.482 --> 29:47.620
Nothing.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.137
Hey.

29:53.137 --> 29:56.551
I know you probably don't want
to talk to me right now.

29:56.551 --> 29:57.586
I know, you're right.

29:57.586 --> 29:59.034
But the thing is...

30:00.275 --> 30:03.000
I really need your help.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.034
I don't know what I would do
without her --

30:05.034 --> 30:06.586
who I'd be.

30:06.586 --> 30:11.379
She was the catalyst
for everything good that is --

30:11.379 --> 30:14.413
<i>was</i> -- happening in my life
before I misspoke.

30:15.758 --> 30:17.689
I'm sorry.

30:17.689 --> 30:21.172
I'm regretful, but it
was an honest mistake.

30:21.172 --> 30:25.448
But I know my words don't mean
much to the world right now.

30:25.448 --> 30:28.551
Tina, what's Jill like
when the cameras <i>aren't</i> around?

30:29.827 --> 30:33.379
Jill is the kindest soul
I've ever met.

30:33.379 --> 30:37.172
She's loving and giving
and empathetic.

30:38.206 --> 30:39.896
And she's strong.

30:39.896 --> 30:42.137
I know what
she's been through.

30:42.137 --> 30:46.310
I was there watching her
struggle with her sexuality.

30:46.310 --> 30:48.482
I wiped tears
from her face.

30:48.482 --> 30:51.827
So, the accusations
against Jill are false?

30:51.827 --> 30:54.275
Jill told me that story
about Lacey one night,

30:54.275 --> 30:57.517
and, yes,
of course I was mortified.

30:57.517 --> 30:59.758
But if you knew
where Jill came from,

30:59.758 --> 31:02.344
then you'd know
she was a victim, too.

31:02.344 --> 31:04.448
I'm so sorry, Lacey.

31:05.724 --> 31:08.896
Tremendously.

31:08.896 --> 31:11.000
I can't take it back.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.137
But I hope you accept
my apology.

31:15.344 --> 31:17.448
I was weak,

31:17.448 --> 31:20.344
I was conflicted,

31:20.344 --> 31:22.103
and I was broken.

31:23.103 --> 31:25.000
And Tina saved me.

31:26.862 --> 31:28.551
You saved me.

31:29.517 --> 31:33.448
So, America does love
a redemption story

31:33.448 --> 31:36.896
almost as much
as a love story.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.965
So, what can we expect
from you two?

31:38.965 --> 31:40.448
You getting
back together?

31:40.448 --> 31:42.482
It's like
we never broke up.

31:42.482 --> 31:45.689
Oh, I am
officially uncanceled.

31:45.689 --> 31:49.000
Whoo!
And "an inspiration,"

31:49.000 --> 31:52.793
and "brave as hell"
for sharing my story.

31:52.793 --> 31:54.310
America is schizophrenic.

31:54.310 --> 31:55.724
Mm-hmm.
Tina is thorough.

31:55.724 --> 31:57.034
She's good for you,
Jill.

31:57.034 --> 31:57.896
Mm.

31:57.896 --> 31:59.551
That was
London's people.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.172
She wants back in the video now
that Jill caught redemption.

32:02.172 --> 32:03.344
- Mm.

32:03.344 --> 32:05.413
See, that's the Hollywood
mentality I can't stand.

32:05.413 --> 32:07.827
It is, but it's also
the thing y'all wanted --

32:07.827 --> 32:09.586
what we thought was best
for the group.

32:09.586 --> 32:10.931
We made a mistake,
y'all.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.862
I made a mistake.

32:13.862 --> 32:15.137
We should drop London.

32:15.137 --> 32:16.482
Drop London?

32:16.482 --> 32:17.827
For who?

32:17.827 --> 32:22.103
Why the hell would I wanna do
your jank-ass video

32:22.103 --> 32:25.310
after y'all did me
dirty-rotten?

32:25.310 --> 32:26.379
Oh?

32:26.379 --> 32:27.413
Oh?

32:27.413 --> 32:29.034
You left me for dead.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.655
I got dropped
by my label.

32:30.655 --> 32:34.241
I owe them $750,000.

32:34.241 --> 32:35.724
And I'm homeless.

32:35.724 --> 32:37.000
And I'm not
hyperbole speaking

32:37.000 --> 32:38.379
like when I say I feel homeless

32:38.379 --> 32:39.517
'cause I got booked
at a Hyatt.

32:39.517 --> 32:42.482
I'm literally homeless!

32:43.310 --> 32:44.793
I have nothing.

32:44.793 --> 32:47.103
Forgive me.
Forgive us.

32:47.103 --> 32:49.586
There would be no Queens
without what you did for us.

32:49.586 --> 32:51.068
You were right.

32:51.068 --> 32:53.931
But you're a part
of this messed-up family.

32:53.931 --> 32:57.034
So, will you please be
in the video?

33:04.275 --> 33:05.931
Who run the world?

33:05.931 --> 33:07.379
Queens!
- Queens!
- Queens!

33:14.137 --> 33:16.517
<i>All rise for the Queens!</i>

33:26.172 --> 33:28.620
It's time to pull files
and examine all the facts

34:07.413 --> 34:08.689
Uh, come on, come on!

34:51.965 --> 34:54.275
My turn.

34:54.275 --> 34:57.344
<i>All rise!</i>

35:37.586 --> 35:38.793
You okay?

35:39.931 --> 35:43.344
This is great,
but I'm still real homeless.

35:43.344 --> 35:44.655
Don't worry about it.

35:44.655 --> 35:46.379
And broke.

35:46.379 --> 35:48.137
I fixed it
with the label.

35:48.137 --> 35:49.862
I paid off the debt.
We cool.

35:49.862 --> 35:51.206
How'd you find
that cheddah?

35:52.172 --> 35:53.793
I found it.

35:53.793 --> 35:54.896
It's the least
that I can do.

35:54.896 --> 35:56.689
And you can crash with me

35:56.689 --> 35:58.172
until we figure
something out.

35:58.172 --> 35:59.344
I told you
I have your back.

35:59.344 --> 36:02.241
Ah! We're roomies!

36:02.241 --> 36:03.620
This is nice.

36:03.620 --> 36:07.137
It is. Especially since
I'm not the Internet's

36:07.137 --> 36:08.896
most hated person
anymore.

36:08.896 --> 36:10.344
Thanks to you.

36:10.344 --> 36:11.862
I just spoke the truth.

36:13.551 --> 36:15.448
You know,
I was thinking, uh,

36:15.448 --> 36:18.344
it wouldn't be impossible
for me

36:18.344 --> 36:21.000
to find someone to cover for me
for a few months.

36:22.034 --> 36:24.379
Uh, what do you mean?

36:24.379 --> 36:27.344
At work.
So I could join you out here.

36:30.413 --> 36:33.896
Did I misunderstand something
about the interview?

36:33.896 --> 36:36.310
And you invited me
to this party.

36:36.310 --> 36:38.551
Tina, I'm sorry you got
the wrong impression,

36:38.551 --> 36:40.241
but I never said --
Got the wrong impression?

36:40.241 --> 36:41.896
I mean,
you did me a favor.

36:41.896 --> 36:43.965
I-I'm grateful,
and given what you did,

36:43.965 --> 36:45.724
it would have been
"optically" dangerous

36:45.724 --> 36:47.310
not to invite you here.

36:47.310 --> 36:49.689
But let's just
have fun tonight, okay?

36:49.689 --> 36:52.103
I'm not sure I have time
or space in my life to --

36:52.103 --> 36:54.172
I put myself on the line
for you.

36:54.172 --> 36:56.724
And I'm appreciative.

36:56.724 --> 36:58.448
But that was your choice.

36:59.793 --> 37:01.931
Wow.

37:01.931 --> 37:03.172
You used me.

37:03.172 --> 37:06.448
God gave us free will.

37:06.448 --> 37:08.517
You're disgusting.

37:10.068 --> 37:11.827
Tina.

37:11.827 --> 37:15.034
This is one of those moments.

37:15.034 --> 37:16.344
Let's enjoy it.

37:16.344 --> 37:18.379
The video is so dope,
y'all.

37:18.379 --> 37:19.448
Let's see
what everyone thinks

37:19.448 --> 37:21.172
after they watch
the documentary.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.482
People want
something real.

37:23.482 --> 37:25.517
The Queens are so far
from perfect,

37:25.517 --> 37:26.655
but you're real women.

37:26.655 --> 37:28.068
People gonna
eat this up.

37:28.068 --> 37:29.655
I mean, we don't do it
for them, anyway.

37:29.655 --> 37:31.482
We do it for us, okay?

37:31.482 --> 37:32.620
Whoo!

37:32.620 --> 37:33.896
Okay!

37:35.034 --> 37:36.413
You've just got
a little sauce.

37:36.413 --> 37:37.724
Just don't smudge.

37:37.724 --> 37:40.620
I spent three hours
in hair and makeup.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.034
Done.

37:42.034 --> 37:42.896
Beautiful.

37:42.896 --> 37:44.551
Mm.

37:44.551 --> 37:46.206
They've got
a chocolate fountain?!

37:46.206 --> 37:47.206
Oh!

37:47.206 --> 37:49.551
I love
that you love carbs.

37:50.655 --> 37:52.310
And...

37:54.827 --> 37:56.172
I love you.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.931
I love you, too.

38:03.344 --> 38:04.655
I'm gonna go
get some chocolate.

38:07.689 --> 38:09.620
Valeria, got a minute?

38:10.965 --> 38:12.862
I see that you're trying
to make us look like clowns.

38:12.862 --> 38:14.103
It's not gonna work.

38:14.103 --> 38:17.103
That's what I need
to talk to you about.

38:17.103 --> 38:19.103
I want to show you
some footage that we got.

38:19.103 --> 38:22.034
Now, if I was a better producer,
I'd have put this in the doc,

38:22.034 --> 38:24.241
but I'm actually
not an asshole.

38:24.241 --> 38:26.689
And I think that you might want
to deal with this privately.

38:26.689 --> 38:28.793
What is it?

38:39.172 --> 38:41.103
Make sure you keep
your guard up.

38:50.379 --> 38:51.620
- Hey.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.206
Hey.

38:53.206 --> 38:56.344
So, now that
we're not working together...

38:56.344 --> 38:57.793
you can dance with me.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.724
Do you dance better
than you play guitar?

38:59.724 --> 39:02.275
No. Probably not.

39:02.275 --> 39:04.862
But I'm passionately bad
at both.

39:06.103 --> 39:09.103
Tonight is about me
and my girls.

39:09.103 --> 39:10.724
Ah, well,
Bree can dance, too.

39:12.931 --> 39:14.448
Dance with me?

39:14.448 --> 39:16.068
Come on.
Yes!

39:51.724 --> 39:53.413
Come on.
Ahh!

40:17.758 --> 40:19.413
What? I'm busy.

40:21.724 --> 40:22.724
Seriously?

40:24.379 --> 40:27.275
You're serious?

40:27.275 --> 40:28.620
I'll let them know.

40:30.241 --> 40:32.517
Guess what, ladies.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.482
You did it.

40:34.482 --> 40:35.862
You did it!

40:37.172 --> 40:40.896
What?
