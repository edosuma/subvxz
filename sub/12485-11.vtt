WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:09.543
Okay, kids. I have
some exciting news.

00:09.577 --> 00:15.349
Today, for the first time,
you will be taking
a state-mandated IQ test.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.550
SOh, man!?

00:16.584 --> 00:19.019
Whoo-hoo! Test! Holla!

00:20.854 --> 00:22.423
Now, for those of you
who don't know,

00:22.456 --> 00:25.459
IQ stands for "idiot quiz."

00:27.461 --> 00:29.497
It measures
your level of stupidity.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.203
Actually, I think
IQ stands for
"intelligence quotient."

00:35.236 --> 00:37.238
And it's supposed to test
how smart you are.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.074
Hmm, that doesn't
sound right.

00:40.108 --> 00:44.478
Anyway, good luck.
I want you all
to do really well.

00:44.512 --> 00:49.250
Or really poorly, depending
on which of us is right
about what IQ stands for.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.220
Do we have
to take this?

00:52.253 --> 00:54.222
IQ tests don't measure
other forms of intelligence.

00:54.255 --> 00:58.559
Like artistic intelligence,
emotional intelligence,

00:58.592 --> 01:01.629
or who can eat the most
corn nuts intelligence.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.565
Well, I don't perform
well on tests.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.633
I fold under pressure.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.406
See? I'm, like,
really nervous.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.212
* Ooh, ooh
 Doo, doo

01:18.246 --> 01:20.514
* Ooh, ooh
 Doo, doo

01:20.548 --> 01:21.649
Whoo!

01:21.682 --> 01:23.251
* Everybody's got that thing

01:23.284 --> 01:25.653
* Something different
 we all bring

01:25.686 --> 01:27.388
* Don't you let 'em
 clip your wings

01:27.421 --> 01:29.323
* You got it
 You got it

01:29.357 --> 01:31.125
* We're on fire and we blaze

01:31.159 --> 01:32.493
* In extraordinary ways

01:32.526 --> 01:33.861
* 365 days

01:33.894 --> 01:36.464
* We got it
 We got it

01:36.497 --> 01:38.266
* You can dream it

01:38.299 --> 01:39.600
* You can be it

01:39.633 --> 01:40.634
* If you can feel it

01:40.668 --> 01:44.205
* You can believe it

01:44.238 --> 01:47.675
* 'Cause I am, you are, we are

01:47.708 --> 01:50.544
* Exceptional
 Exceptional

01:50.578 --> 01:55.283
* Yeah, I am, you are, we are

01:55.316 --> 01:59.287
* Exceptional
 Exceptional

01:59.320 --> 02:01.422
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

02:01.455 --> 02:03.324
* Ooh, ooh

02:03.357 --> 02:04.458
Whoo!

02:10.264 --> 02:13.734
Inside these envelopes
are the results
of your IQ test.

02:15.969 --> 02:20.508
Why does mine say
to eat more leafy greens?

02:20.541 --> 02:23.577
Oh. Sorry.
That's the result of
my cholesterol test.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.947
Oh, I did pretty well.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.250
You're holding it
upside down.

02:32.486 --> 02:36.224
Oh, that makes more sense.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.526
Here, Fletcher.
This is what a good
score looks like.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.632
How'd you do, Chyna?

02:44.665 --> 02:47.968
Who cares? It's just
a stupid test.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.304
Come on.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.505
Don't be embarrassed.
I mean, not everyone
can be a genius.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.443
What the heck?

02:56.577 --> 02:59.680
Your score is
higher than mine!

02:59.713 --> 03:02.450
I'm as surprised
as you are.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.252
Well, not quite
as surprised.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.720
Your eyes are practically
popping out of your head.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.991
There must be
some mistake.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.227
Maybe you should
take the test again.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.563
Yeah. I mean, maybe
they mixed up my score
with someone else's,

03:15.596 --> 03:17.665
or maybe I didn't use
a number two pencil.

03:17.698 --> 03:21.769
(LAUGHS)
You said, "Number two."

03:23.637 --> 03:26.274
Well, now we know
how Angus did.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.280
I hate P.E.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.548
I have to take off my makeup,
put on my P.E. makeup,

03:34.582 --> 03:39.753
take off my P.E. makeup,
then put on my
regular makeup again.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.590
And the gym uniforms
are so unflattering.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.458
I know.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.260
I've been wearing
these shorts for an hour

03:46.294 --> 03:47.761
and they haven't said
one nice thing to me.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.438 --> 03:59.006
LEXI: Cameron?

03:59.039 --> 04:01.275
Why weren't you
in P.E. today?

04:01.309 --> 04:03.444
I'm training to try out
for the Olympics.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.580
You can be excused if
you're on the varsity team
or training competitively.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.583
Really?

04:09.617 --> 04:10.784
Well, maybe I could pursue
that stupid Olympic dream

04:10.818 --> 04:13.554
with you and get
out of P.E., too.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.558
So, what event
are we training for?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.692
Perfect.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.830
As you can see,
I'm an expert at curling.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.433
No, curling is a
winter Olympic sport.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.637
It's exactly like bowling,
but with no pins, no gutters,

04:29.670 --> 04:32.340
no bowling balls, on ice,
and using brooms.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.611
Okay. These are my
new IQ test results.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.550
Wow.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.518
Now your IQ is even
lower than Fletcher's.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.755
And he's an idiot.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.625
Ha-ha!

04:53.694 --> 04:55.062
Listen, it doesn't matter
what your score is,

04:55.095 --> 04:57.798
and it doesn't mean
you're not smart.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.334
Olive, I just
want you to know
I'm perfectly willing

05:00.368 --> 05:02.470
to love you
just for your looks.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.774
This is impossible.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.642
There is no way you guys
are smarter than I am.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.613
What are you
trying to say?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.449
See? The very fact that
you don't understand
proves my point.

05:17.751 --> 05:22.623
You know, having a
photographic memory is not
the same as being smart.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.892
I mean, a digital camera
has a photographic memory,

05:24.925 --> 05:27.395
but that does not
make it a genius.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.763
Are you guys saying
you think I'm dumb?

05:29.797 --> 05:32.366
No! I'm not saying
that at all.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.401
The test is.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.915
Okay, so how does
this curling work?

05:47.948 --> 05:50.150
So, one player pushes
a heavy stone
toward a target.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.385
Then...

05:52.886 --> 05:54.922
What are you doing?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.590
This sounded like
it might be boring.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.927
There. Much better.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.563
Continue.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.865
So, two other players
guide the stone
toward the target

06:04.898 --> 06:06.534
by sweeping in front of it.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.437
We'll use this bucket
as the stone.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.805
You push it
and I'll sweep.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.574
Whatever you say, beautiful.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.614
Ooh! Are you guys
doing my favorite sport?

06:20.648 --> 06:25.686
Bowling with no pins,
no gutters, no bowling balls
and using brooms?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.556
Yes. Want to be
on our team?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.558
We need two sweepers
if we're going
to make the Olympics.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.827
Oh, well, I would
love to get back
to the Olympics again.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.864
Did I ever tell you
I was on the US
synchronized tennis team?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.699
You mean
synchronized swimming?

06:38.732 --> 06:41.635
No. Synchronized tennis,

06:41.669 --> 06:42.870
where two guys
are playing singles

06:42.903 --> 06:44.438
and you run out
onto the court

06:44.472 --> 06:46.574
and try to mimic
their every move.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.910
Then security guards
chase you and shoot you
with a tranquilizer dart,

06:49.943 --> 06:52.846
and you try to see
how far you can run

06:52.880 --> 06:55.616
before your body goes
completely numb.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.750
I won the silver.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.956
Sorry I'm late
for lunch class.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.993
I got lost
in the hallways.

07:06.026 --> 07:06.994
Tee-hee, hee, hee, hee.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.530
Olive?

07:09.563 --> 07:11.198
What are you doing?

07:11.231 --> 07:13.534
Not saying I don't like it.
I just wanna know.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.970
Well, the test says
I'm a dumb blonde,

07:17.004 --> 07:21.041
so I guess I should
start acting like one.

07:23.677 --> 07:27.615
Which one of these
is a fork?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.484
Forks are the ones
with the pointy things.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.619
Actually, they're
called tines.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.887
Interesting factoid,

07:33.921 --> 07:36.957
forks weren't even
common in Europe
until the 18th century.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.726
Ugh! I'm even stupid
at being stupid!

07:40.794 --> 07:42.696
Hey. Don't sell
yourself short.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.666
You can be
anything you want.

07:45.699 --> 07:49.469
A dumb blonde,
my girlfriend, anything!

07:50.070 --> 07:51.705
Hey, Olive.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.975
Want half of my
bread house?

07:55.008 --> 07:58.946
See, this is
who I should be
spending time with.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.516
Paisley, how can I be
just like you?

08:02.550 --> 08:05.653
First, you need
to sew my name
into your clothes.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.924
But that says,
"Made in Taiwan."

08:11.992 --> 08:15.095
That's my "maiden" name.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.834
Wow, I have so much
to unlearn from you.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.705
Can you believe the

08:25.673 --> 08:28.576
audacity of Olive?

08:28.609 --> 08:30.510
Like she's the only
one of us who's...

08:30.911 --> 08:33.614
Perspicacious.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.982
Yeah! We could be
smart without Olive.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.519
Care to partake
in a game of chess?
I'll let you be the prawn.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.691
You know, you're not
the easiest person
to be smart with.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.093
Are you calling me stupid?

08:46.126 --> 08:49.997
No, I'm calling you
lacking in

08:50.964 --> 08:51.832
cognizance.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.133
That's better.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.743
Sweep faster!

09:02.776 --> 09:04.845
I've yelled at
dozens of maids
in my lifetime,

09:04.878 --> 09:08.115
and you guys are
by far the worst!

09:11.619 --> 09:12.620
(BOTH LAUGH EXCITEDLY)

09:13.621 --> 09:15.823
Oh. Great news!

09:15.856 --> 09:19.960
I just checked online
and I'm now the number one
ranked curler in California.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.729
You're number one
in a sport?

09:21.762 --> 09:25.799
How'd that happen?

09:25.833 --> 09:28.368
Because the only other guy
who played it just died.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.737
I'm number one!

09:29.770 --> 09:32.005
I'm number one!

09:32.039 --> 09:34.007
Well, I don't know
anything about curling,

09:34.041 --> 09:36.844
except that I can do it
better than you.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.779
Maybe I'll give it a go.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.880
No! You can't
do that.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.016
Why? Afraid of
a little competition?

09:43.050 --> 09:46.620
(SCOFFS) I'm not afraid
of a little competition.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.855
I'm afraid of
any competition.

09:49.857 --> 09:53.894
Bring it on, pip-squeak.

09:53.927 --> 09:58.165
We're going
to mop the floor
with your team.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.869
Uh, I thought
we were using brooms.
I'm afraid of mops.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.937
They remind me of witches.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.073
Why? Witches
ride on brooms.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.076
(SCREAMS)

10:16.116 --> 10:20.187
There you are, Chyna.
I've been searching
the globe for you.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.891
I found China,
but apparently,
it's a different China.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.796
Anyway, you need to get
ready for tomorrow.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.430
Why? What's tomorrow?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.199
The regional high school
Acadecathlon.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.902
Ten events testing
feats of brain power.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.970
Principal Skidmore wants
you to represent Webster

10:37.004 --> 10:38.672
since you have
the highest IQ.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.107
Am I No.ered?

10:41.809 --> 10:44.411
Oh, good! Your books
are finally here.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.478
You might want
to quickly memorize
all of them.

10:48.982 --> 10:54.955
The aca-dacka-alpaca...
Who named this stupid thing?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.825
I have to memorize
all of these books

10:57.858 --> 10:59.459
and you're just giving
them to me now?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.995
Well, it would have
cost an extra $1.75

11:02.029 --> 11:03.430
to have them
shipped overnight,

11:03.463 --> 11:06.099
so I used the 14-day
bulk rate.

11:06.133 --> 11:10.838
Gibson, there is
no way I can win this.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.106
Well, you better
figure out a way,

11:13.140 --> 11:15.475
because Webster
has never lost.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.944
And if you lose,

11:16.977 --> 11:21.014
you will feel
Principal Skidmore's rash.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.983
Uh, you mean her wrath?

11:23.016 --> 11:23.951
Nope.

11:33.961 --> 11:37.230
Okay, if you're going
to be like me, you should
do things I do.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.467
Like, right now,
I'm reading this book.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.270
War & Peace?
How far have you gotten?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.005
Halfway through.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.106
The title.

11:48.541 --> 11:55.215
I sounded out "war"
but what is this letter?

11:55.248 --> 11:59.119
Actually, it's a logogram
called an ampersand.

11:59.152 --> 12:04.992
I mean, it's a squiggly-doo!

12:05.025 --> 12:07.995
Paisley, have you seen...
Olive?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.298
What are you wearing?

12:11.331 --> 12:12.900
You look ridiculous.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.971
Ridicaluss?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.342
Me no understand.

12:24.344 --> 12:28.248
You took the words
right OLIVE: Right?e hole.

12:30.583 --> 12:35.188
Listen, I know we had
that big fight earlier,
but I was way out of line.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.190
That's why I'm going
to make it up to you

12:37.224 --> 12:42.963
and let you compete in
the aca-dacka-Chewbacca...

12:42.996 --> 12:45.298
AcadeYes.lon?

12:45.332 --> 12:47.334
Skidmore wants me
to do it but I don't
care what she wants.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.070
I owe you one.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.239
Don't pretend like
you're doing this for me.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.573
Obviously you're just
trying to get out
of doing it yourself.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.208
What do you think
I am, stupid?

12:55.242 --> 12:55.976
No!.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.950
Listen, Olive. Forget
what the IQ test says.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.052
There's no better person
to compete tomorrow.

13:05.085 --> 13:09.890
Well, me no thinks
a stupid person like me

13:09.923 --> 13:13.861
would do very goodly
at a fancy smart
person contest.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.998
Let's go, Paisley.

13:18.031 --> 13:18.999
We aren't smart enough
to hang around

13:19.032 --> 13:23.303
Chyna squiggly-doo Fletcher.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.310
Who's squiggly-doo?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.356
Oh, wow,
the local news is here?

13:44.257 --> 13:46.126
This is a big deal!

13:46.159 --> 13:51.098
And your competition
looks really smart.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.333
Fletcher,
you're not helping.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.203
When have you ever
known me to help?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.872
All right.

13:58.906 --> 13:59.973
Did you memorize
everything in those books?

14:00.007 --> 14:03.043
No. I can't remember facts.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.278
But I can remember lyrics.

14:05.312 --> 14:09.282
It was a ton of work,
but I took all the information
and turned it into songs.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.084
I actually wrote
a pretty good dance song

14:11.118 --> 14:13.020
about the
cardiovascular system.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.155
I rhymed "angioplasty"

14:15.188 --> 14:18.926
with "ooh, you so nasty."
(LAUGHS)

14:18.959 --> 14:21.094
All right, the host
should be here any minute.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.163
Some guy named
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
Thomas Norden.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.965
(LAUGHS)

14:24.998 --> 14:27.367
That's Professor
 Thomas Norden.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.303
A porpoise?

14:30.337 --> 14:32.940
The host is a porpoise?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.375
I'm a dolphin,
 you ignoramus.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.946
But I guess we all
 look alike to you.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.049
You can talk?

14:42.082 --> 14:45.152
Yes. I speak through this
 computerized translator

14:45.185 --> 14:49.656
because you humans
 are too arrogant to
 learn to speak Dolphin.

14:49.689 --> 14:53.193
Wow. This dolphin has
a real chip on his shoulder.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.461
Well, for a guy
with no shoulders.

14:56.329 --> 15:00.934
Welcome to the
 aca-dacka-alpaca...

15:00.968 --> 15:03.170
Who named this thing?

15:03.203 --> 15:07.474
All right,
 our first competition is
 a crossword challenge.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.310
First one
 to accurately complete
 their puzzle wins.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.112
Begin.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.083
Okay. One across...

15:16.116 --> 15:17.985
Okay. "What is the world's
fifth tallest mountain?"

15:18.018 --> 15:19.953
No problem.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.389
* You will never rest
 When you climb Everest

15:22.422 --> 15:25.325
* The second best view
 Is at the top of K2

15:25.358 --> 15:27.160
* You'll shout cowabunga!

15:27.194 --> 15:28.161
* When you ascend
 Kanchenjunga... *

(BELL CHIMING)

15:32.232 --> 15:38.438
We have a winner!
 The student from the
 Sumpter Bridgett Academy.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.041
CHYNA: What?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.243
He already answered
that question?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.013
He answered
 all the questions.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.250
But I didn't even
get to the chorus.

15:54.321 --> 15:58.058
For the second event,
 use the materials
 in front of you

15:58.091 --> 16:01.961
to build a molecular
 model of the element
 with atomic number 81.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.731
So easy.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.434
If you want
 a real challenge,
 try doing this.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.442
Begin.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.544
(CLOCK TICKING)

16:17.577 --> 16:20.013
* If you're having dinner

(BELL CHIMING)

16:29.056 --> 16:31.258
Time's up!
 Yale Eastlake takes it.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.329
Wait!

16:36.363 --> 16:37.197
But I almost had the answer.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.069
(LAUGHING)

16:47.207 --> 16:48.775
Everyone's
laughing at Chyna.

16:48.808 --> 16:52.045
I can't watch this.

16:52.079 --> 16:55.515
Sure you can.
Just move your
hands, silly.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.188
The janitor's
on your team?

17:01.221 --> 17:03.490
No fair! This is
an amateur competition!

17:03.523 --> 17:05.224
That guy's a pro!

17:07.827 --> 17:11.064
Let's start.
May the best man win.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.531
I don't want
the best man to win.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.200
I want to win!

17:18.637 --> 17:21.441
Come on, sweep like
your lives depend on it!

17:21.473 --> 17:23.242
Because they do!

17:31.884 --> 17:32.619
Witches aren't real!

17:32.652 --> 17:34.621
Witches aren't real!

17:38.525 --> 17:40.127
Yes!

17:43.630 --> 17:50.103
For the next competition,
 arrange this series of books
 in chronological order

17:50.137 --> 17:52.139
based on year of publication.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.173
Begin.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.209
(PLAYS PITCH PIPE)

17:56.243 --> 17:58.545
* Tolstoy!

18:04.384 --> 18:06.386
Chyna, people are
laughing at you.
You have to do something.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.287
Stop putting pressure on me!

18:15.228 --> 18:18.365
This is terrible.
That's not how you fold
a fitted sheet.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.502
Plus, she's
embarrassing herself.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.303
I have to help her.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.907
Chyna, let me
take it from here.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.511
So you think you can just
come into the middle of this
competition and save us?

18:31.544 --> 18:33.146
Yeah.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.681
Good. She stinks.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.553
It's a trick.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.890
Dostoyevsky's The Idiot
was serialized in 1868,

18:43.923 --> 18:46.526
but wasn't published
as a book until 1869,

18:46.559 --> 18:50.563
so it comes after
Alcott's Little Women.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.432
An obv No. s trap.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.267
An obvious trap is a tuna net.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.604
Webster wins the round.

19:01.608 --> 19:06.313
And FYI, The Idiot
is my nickname for each
of my fellow competitors.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.383
And that is the breakdown

19:10.417 --> 19:13.486
of the causes
of how dinosaurs
became extinct.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.489
Yes, and the same fate
 awaits you foolish humans.

19:19.259 --> 19:23.630
What? I didn't say anything.
 We have no plans.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.332
We (BELL CHIMING) s!

19:28.235 --> 19:29.736
You did it, Olive.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.705
Thank you so much.
You completely
saved my butt.

19:32.739 --> 19:36.209
Well, if there's two things
I really love, it's you

19:36.243 --> 19:39.746
and organizing timelines
of dead authors.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.215
Well, I'm sorry
I made you feel dumb.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.251
And I'm sorry I overreacted.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.987
It's just so much
of my identity is tied up
with being smart.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.689
Well, you're more
than just smart.

19:49.722 --> 19:53.793
You're kind, and fun
and you're my best friend.

19:59.399 --> 19:59.432
Excuse me.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.372
Look, Paisley.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.775
We had some fun times,
but all good things
must come to an end.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.611
And I want you to know
that it's not you, it's me.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.213
We're from two different
worlds and it wasn't
meant to be.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.683
I like oranges!

20:23.423 --> 20:25.258
I don't understand, Olive.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.260
How could the IQ test
say you weren't smart

20:27.294 --> 20:29.529
when you just
crushed everyone?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.664
I don't know.
And who cares
about some test?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.533
I know I'm smart and
that's all that matters.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.001
Shoot!

20:35.034 --> 20:36.369
So I did all this
for nothing?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.572
Did all what, Angus?

20:40.440 --> 20:40.507
Never mind.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.478
Angus?

20:45.512 --> 20:47.814
Did you do something
to the test results?

20:47.847 --> 20:52.385
If by "something" you mean
logged into the system,

20:52.419 --> 20:54.554
made Olive look dumb
so it'd lower her self-esteem

20:54.587 --> 20:56.323
so she would go
out with me...

20:57.857 --> 21:00.593
Then no.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.861
(SCREAMS)

21:04.731 --> 21:06.366

21:07.066 --> 21:08.401
(LAUGHING)

21:13.606 --> 21:16.309
Okay. We're winning.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.379

more ahead if somebody
wasn't a choke artist!

21:19.846 --> 21:20.813
(WHIMPERS)

21:21.814 --> 21:23.350
Okay, guys.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.752
We're neck and neck.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.621
Actually,
we're neck, neck, neck
and neck, neck, neck.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.492
Because there are six necks.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.796
I'm very good
at counting necks.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.406
BOTH: Yeah!

21:49.809 --> 21:51.744
Yes! We did it!

21:51.778 --> 21:55.382
After beating a janitor,
a wolf mascot,
and a little girl,

21:55.415 --> 21:56.516
nobody can stand in our way!

21:57.917 --> 22:00.119
Ooh.

22:00.152 --> 22:04.824
Want to get up here, Lexi?
I've got three more shoulders.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.493
Uh, I'm not as good
at counting shoulders.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.866
Well, all we have to do
now is practice curling

22:13.900 --> 22:17.103
for nine hours a day,
six days a week,
for the next three years,

22:17.136 --> 22:19.472
and we'll be ready
for the Olympics.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.840
You've got to be kidding me!

22:20.873 --> 22:23.543
I'm not spending
three years with you.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.679
How about now?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.383
Well, how can I say
no to that face?
