00:09.500 --> 00:13.208
<i>Your grandmother could trace your roots to</i>

00:13.208 --> 00:14.875
<i>the first Choctaw.</i>

00:18.416 --> 00:20.000
<i>You have to learn</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:21.083
<i>to jump</i>

00:21.083 --> 00:22.958
<i>between two worlds.</i>

00:28.000 --> 00:30.083
You're my family.

00:56.541 --> 00:58.083
You're starting a war.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.625
There's already a war.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.708
How are you?

07:47.166 --> 07:48.375
Do you want to eat?

14:18.708 --> 14:19.875
LEAVE NOW.

14:24.958 --> 14:25.625
GO.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.000
You okay?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.208
I will be.

16:47.375 --> 16:48.583
Looks like they're in no hurry.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.958
What are they waiting for?

17:01.333 --> 17:01.916
Stop.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.750
Stop looking for a way out of here?

17:04.083 --> 17:04.875
You know

17:04.875 --> 17:05.916
what I mean.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.083
Look.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.416
I'm just here for work stuff.

17:08.416 --> 17:10.166
No sense disrupting your life

17:10.166 --> 17:11.666
if I'm not going to be here long.

17:12.583 --> 17:13.250
Bullshit.

17:13.708 --> 17:16.250
You can't even

17:16.250 --> 17:17.875
look me in the eye.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.000
I waited for you.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.125
Every night

17:24.125 --> 17:25.666
for years.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.458
And you still couldn't be bothered

17:28.458 --> 17:30.083
to send one message.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.916
We drifted apart.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.333
It happens.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.166
We didn't drift.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.000
All those emails, texts.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.458
Nothing ever came back.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.375
You didn't text

17:44.375 --> 17:45.916
me back after

17:45.916 --> 17:48.708
your dad died.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.833
I would have been there.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.166
Someone is coming

19:30.166 --> 19:31.625
to pay them for you.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.958
What do we do?

19:36.583 --> 19:37.625
I'm going to punch you.

28:46.583 --> 28:47.375
PAH!

30:49.166 --> 30:50.208
Does it hurt?

30:50.458 --> 30:52.000
You could have broken something.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.958
Sorry. Had to look real.

30:57.500 --> 30:58.708
Listen.

30:58.708 --> 30:59.833
You need to go.

31:01.166 --> 31:02.041
Go?

31:02.041 --> 31:04.750
We have to wait for the police.

31:05.041 --> 31:06.708
No police. I can't have police.

31:06.708 --> 31:07.833
Please.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.750
Do you think they'll come back?

31:16.166 --> 31:18.541
I won't let anyone hurt you.

31:18.541 --> 31:20.083
I promise.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.500
They were here for me.

31:23.875 --> 31:25.208
Not you.

31:27.875 --> 31:29.708
I need you to go home, Bonnie.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.333
We'll talk soon, I promise.

31:32.750 --> 31:33.875
You promise?

32:04.875 --> 32:07.375
What the hell just happened?

32:07.791 --> 32:08.791
Which part?

32:10.041 --> 32:10.958
The part

32:10.958 --> 32:12.583
where we

32:12.583 --> 32:14.708
were kidnapped by the guy

32:14.708 --> 32:16.333
who cleans my skates?

32:16.875 --> 32:17.666
Or

32:18.083 --> 32:20.000
the part where we

32:20.541 --> 32:21.916
almost die

32:22.500 --> 32:23.833
because there's a price

32:23.833 --> 32:25.375
on your head?

32:26.333 --> 32:27.541
We wouldn't be here

32:27.541 --> 32:31.416
if someone hadn't called off
Zane and his dogs.

32:34.291 --> 32:35.458
There's

32:36.166 --> 32:37.500
only one

32:37.500 --> 32:38.583
person who

32:38.583 --> 32:39.541
could have.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.375
I shot him in the face.

32:59.250 --> 33:00.333
Look...

33:00.666 --> 33:01.791
tonight...

33:03.125 --> 33:04.083
things...

33:05.208 --> 33:07.166
caught up to us both.

33:07.625 --> 33:08.291
If...

33:09.125 --> 33:10.083
the offer

33:10.083 --> 33:11.083
still stands...

33:14.291 --> 33:15.958
I'm helping you.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.125
You

34:20.125 --> 34:21.916
don't

34:21.916 --> 34:23.166
like it.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.208
I just prefer

34:26.208 --> 34:27.875
a simpler look.

34:28.166 --> 34:29.500
That's all.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.083
Hello!

34:32.083 --> 34:34.833
You live in

34:34.833 --> 34:36.208
New York.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.166
You represent

34:38.166 --> 34:40.250
your people.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.083
That means...

34:45.500 --> 34:47.833
a Choctaw Warrior

34:47.833 --> 34:51.833
is on the scene.

34:52.708 --> 34:53.708
But...

34:54.041 --> 34:55.041
if you...

34:55.500 --> 34:57.875
don't like it,

34:58.541 --> 34:59.916
I could...

35:01.125 --> 35:02.166
paint it

35:02.166 --> 35:03.666
matte black.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.416
Leave it as is.

35:06.416 --> 35:07.791
I'll just wear

35:07.791 --> 35:09.416
my pants over it.

35:11.541 --> 35:12.833
I'm just teasing.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.500
Now, you know

35:39.958 --> 35:41.583
I don't

35:42.750 --> 35:43.958
get in

35:43.958 --> 35:45.291
family business.

35:47.583 --> 35:50.083
Since your

35:50.083 --> 35:51.791
grandmother

35:51.791 --> 35:52.916
and I

35:53.708 --> 35:54.958
not together

35:55.458 --> 35:56.458
no more.

35:57.708 --> 35:58.666
But...

35:59.875 --> 36:02.291
you won't

36:02.291 --> 36:03.750
go see her?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.291
She doesn't wanna see me.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.125
Her heart was broken

36:10.125 --> 36:11.500
when you left.

36:12.416 --> 36:14.250
She left

36:14.250 --> 36:15.958
this place

36:15.958 --> 36:17.625
like it was.

36:18.083 --> 36:20.416
Like a museum.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.208
She could've reached out any time.

36:24.208 --> 36:26.041
She never did.

36:33.666 --> 36:34.958
I guess...

36:35.458 --> 36:37.541
we all

36:38.583 --> 36:40.375
do things

36:40.791 --> 36:42.291
we wish

36:42.291 --> 36:43.875
were different.
