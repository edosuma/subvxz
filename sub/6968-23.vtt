01:16.159 --> 01:18.287
Morris?

01:22.124 --> 01:25.294
Morris, I need to talk to you!

01:25.335 --> 01:28.046
Morris, it's me. Are you in there?

01:29.006 --> 01:31.133
Morris?

01:32.342 --> 01:35.429
Morris, if you're in there,
open the damn door!

01:36.722 --> 01:40.058
Morris! Morris, open up!

01:44.146 --> 01:46.190
Morris, I need to talk to you!

01:46.607 --> 01:49.568
Gail Anne is dead. It was my fault.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.032
Morris!

02:01.788 --> 02:04.291
Morris, I need to talk to you.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.294
Come to the door, Morris, please.
Answer the door, dammit!

02:19.806 --> 02:21.517
Oh, no!

02:24.311 --> 02:26.313
No.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.233
Oh, God, no! No, God!

02:31.902 --> 02:33.987
God, no.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.782
No, no, no, no, no.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.951
Please, no. Please!

02:39.952 --> 02:43.052
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 23 - Soft Light

03:27.332 --> 03:30.794
Two apparent abductions
in a month, then this one.

03:30.878 --> 03:36.049
My contact says the Richmond PD's hit
a brick wall, so I said we'd have a look.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.218
- Who's your contact?
- Kelly Ryan.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.888
She was one of my students at the academy.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.140
She's been bumped up to detective...

03:43.223 --> 03:47.978
...and she's nervous about her supervisor
finding out the FBI are involved.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.147
- Kelly?
- Agent Scully.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.735
- Hi. This is Agent Mulder.
- Hi. Thank you for coming.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.863
- You're welcome.
- Heard a lot about you.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.032
We'll talk later.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.953
The missing man is Patrick Newirth, aged 52.

04:05.037 --> 04:08.916
He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco,
up here for a meeting.

04:08.999 --> 04:12.252
- He arrived by train.
- How do you know he's missing?

04:12.336 --> 04:16.507
He set a wake-up call for 6am.
The operator tried, but got no answer.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.593
Mm. Scotch. It looks like
he barely touched it.

04:19.676 --> 04:25.098
Needless to say, he missed his meeting.
After three hours, they sent hotel security up.

04:25.182 --> 04:31.230
The door was locked, security chain fastened.
And when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.690
- Windows?
- Locked from the inside.

04:33.857 --> 04:38.070
We're six storeys up, no fire escape.
No way in or out of this room.

04:38.904 --> 04:43.158
- Agent Scully, what are you lookin' at?
- Uh, the heat register.

04:43.909 --> 04:47.871
- You think anyone could squeeze in there?
- You never know.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.876
- You guys turn up any forensics evidence?
- Uh, just this.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.760
- Scully, look at this.
- What is it?

05:01.844 --> 05:06.139
We don't know. The hotel claims
it wasn't here before Mr Newirth checked in.

05:06.431 --> 05:10.060
There were similar burn marks
at the previous crime scenes.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.898
- Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?
- No. His wife says he loathed cigarettes.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.777
- Yet he worked for a tobacco company.
- Did you run a test on it?

05:18.861 --> 05:22.573
Yes, sir. Mostly carbon,
with some potassium and trace minerals.

05:22.656 --> 05:27.286
- Could be residue from burnt human flesh.
- Does this look like an arm to anybody?

05:28.579 --> 05:31.290
- An arm?
- What are you thinkin', Mulder?

05:32.875 --> 05:37.004
This burn mark is right where
I'd stand to answer the door, right?

05:37.087 --> 05:40.174
- Yes.
- And I'd only look out the peephole...

05:40.257 --> 05:44.720
...if there was something to look at, right?
- That makes sense.

05:50.475 --> 05:54.146
- Could you have this bulb dusted for prints?
- Of course.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.942
And can you run those against
Mr Newirth's? Do you have his prints?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.570
From his toiletries and check-in slip.

06:01.653 --> 06:05.616
Check them against
all hotel employees and guests.

06:05.699 --> 06:10.412
- Anything else?
- What's the name of the last missing person?

06:10.495 --> 06:13.081
That would be Margaret Wysnecki.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.501
Thanks. This should do it.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.920
Is this your first case, Detective?

06:19.505 --> 06:22.424
- Yes, sir.
- Any idea why they gave it to you?

06:24.176 --> 06:26.345
No one else wanted it.

06:26.428 --> 06:30.599
Because of the lack of evidence,
this is still a missing persons case...

06:30.682 --> 06:33.560
...not likely to end up on the front pages.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.355
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.025
Can I ask what you think
may have happened?

06:40.108 --> 06:44.196
At first blush?
Spontaneous human combustion.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.993
You're doing just fine.

06:50.494 --> 06:53.205
- Having a little fun?
- What do you mean?

06:53.288 --> 06:57.793
- Spontaneous human combustion?
- I have case files of bodies reduced to ash...

06:57.876 --> 07:02.214
...with no attendant burning or melting.
Rapid oxidation without heat.

07:02.297 --> 07:06.468
Let's forget that there's
no scientific theory to support it.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.637
OK.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.175
Hey, Scully. Can you spare a prophylactic?

07:58.937 --> 08:01.023
What are the odds of that, huh?

08:01.106 --> 08:03.775
Darkness covers a multitude of sins.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.698
Check this out. My newest tool
in the fight against crime.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.784
$49.95 at your local hardware store.

08:12.868 --> 08:17.206
Neat trick. For your birthday,
I'll buy you a utility belt.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.760
- Look at this, Mulder.
- Hm. What do we know about the victim?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.596
Margaret Wysnecki, aged 66.

08:32.679 --> 08:37.643
Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco,
where she worked for 36 years.

08:37.726 --> 08:41.063
Tobacco? Patrick Newirth
worked for Morley Tobacco.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.733
Half of Richmond earns their paycheck
making cancer sticks.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.569
- Could be just a coincidence.
- Yeah, probably.

08:47.653 --> 08:53.450
The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert,
worked for Polarity Magnetics Inc.

08:56.578 --> 09:01.208
They didn't find any prints. Why should
the prints on the bulb mean anything?

09:01.291 --> 09:03.377
I don't know.

09:07.130 --> 09:12.219
Oh, look at this, Scully.
Someone forgot to empty the trash.

09:14.471 --> 09:19.643
M Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads,
Virginia. Return train dated March 17th.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.605
- The day she disappeared.
- Patrick Newirth came by train.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.983
And Gail Anne Lambert...

09:27.484 --> 09:30.863
Uh, no. Nothing here
puts her near the train station.

09:30.946 --> 09:34.741
- Maybe that detail was overlooked.
- What's the significance?

09:34.825 --> 09:40.789
Maybe these people are being hunted,
and the hunter's working the train station.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.625
What about spontaneous
human combustion?

09:43.709 --> 09:47.212
Maybe it's not spontaneous.
Call your young detective...

09:47.296 --> 09:50.883
...and tell her to get a detail
down to the train station.

10:49.233 --> 10:54.696
Suspicious male in the alley
behind the station. I'm gonna check him out.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.658
Roger that, 64. I'm on my way.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.369
Sir, could I speak with you?

11:01.912 --> 11:04.957
Hold on! I only wanna ask you
a couple of questions!

11:05.040 --> 11:08.544
All right, stop right there.
Don't move. Just hold it.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.129
Put your hands in the air, sir.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.552
Stay... away from me.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.391
What do you think you're doin'?
Come on outta there.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.810
We just wanna talk to you.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.272
Stay away from me. I don't wanna hurt you.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.025
- Move it.
- Hands where we can see them.

11:43.287 --> 11:46.081
Please... I'm warning you.

11:47.124 --> 11:52.254
- I'm a dangerous man.
- Keep movin', pal, out where we can see ya.

11:57.134 --> 12:01.430
All right. I want you to
lie face down on the ground.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.600
Don't... come any closer.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.769
Get down on the ground, sir. Now!

12:08.770 --> 12:11.148
Please! You don't understand.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.986
- Oh, God! No!
- Barney?

12:18.030 --> 12:20.032
Don't! No! Stay away!

12:25.787 --> 12:27.956
Oh, God!

12:29.249 --> 12:31.752
Oh, God! Not again!

12:32.669 --> 12:35.923
No! No! No! No!

12:57.069 --> 13:01.365
- What happened here, Kelly?
- I sent two patrolmen down here.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.826
They lost radio contact
with them just after midnight.

13:04.910 --> 13:08.747
- All they found was two more scorch marks.
- Nothing else?

13:08.830 --> 13:13.502
No. Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case,
and I'm indirectly responsible.

13:13.585 --> 13:18.382
- You were just doing your job.
- They wanna know why I sent these men.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.553
- If I tell them I've involved you, they'll snap.
- Those prints?

13:22.636 --> 13:25.681
I ran it against all
the hotel staff and guests...

13:25.764 --> 13:29.017
...then through the national
databases. No match.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.940
- Some first case, huh?
- Make sure you hang on to this case.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.067
I'm sure something will turn up.

13:37.526 --> 13:41.321
- These ideas of yours. Care to share them?
- Not yet.

13:41.405 --> 13:46.243
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- He was here, Scully. I was right about that.

13:50.539 --> 13:54.751
- So where does this leave us?
- Maybe with enough to identify the killer.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.671
- How?
- He was here last night.

13:57.754 --> 14:01.884
He was also probably here
on March 17th and March 31st.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.887
The days that the other
two people disappeared.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.473
That leaves us with three days
of station video tapes to check...

14:08.557 --> 14:13.896
...and hopefully find out who this guy is.
- That's assuming we're looking for a guy.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.399
Either way, the security camera's
our only witness.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.200
It could be any one of these people, Mulder.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.577
Or none of them.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.956
We've gone through the entire week
and I'm still not sure how to find him.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.918
That's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck.

14:36.001 --> 14:39.213
- Let's go back to the terminal tape.
- Again?

14:39.755 --> 14:42.007
He's gotta be on at least one tape.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.844
Chances are he's not carrying
a sign with an arrow on it.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.013
There you go.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.520
See this guy, right here? He's always here.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.980
What's he doing?

14:57.689 --> 15:00.984
- Looking at the floor.
- Why's he doin' that?

15:01.652 --> 15:06.615
Probably the same reason he spends
his whole afternoon in the train station.

15:07.282 --> 15:10.410
- Can you freeze this and blow it up 200%?
- Sure.

15:15.749 --> 15:19.086
OK. Can you reframe
and blow it up some more?

15:20.754 --> 15:23.215
See, he's got something on his jacket.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.218
Let's see if I can pull it up.

15:29.596 --> 15:33.642
- Polarity Magnetics.
- That's where the first victim worked.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.743
Looks like it's been closed up.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.832
- Yes?
- We're Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.962
We're looking for a man
who may have worked here.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.677
- When was this taken?
- March 22nd. Do you know him?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.514
Sure I know him. Dr Chester Banton.

16:12.598 --> 16:16.810
- He was my business partner.
- You mean he's not any more?

16:17.811 --> 16:20.314
I don't know. I would assume not.

16:20.397 --> 16:23.400
This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.404
- I wondered if he wasn't gonna turn up dead.
- How's that?

16:27.487 --> 16:30.991
Chester was involved
in a terrible accident here.

16:34.161 --> 16:38.707
Polarity Magnetics does, or did,
primarily two kinds of research.

16:38.790 --> 16:43.045
Mostly we designed maglev applications -
people movers, bullet trains.

16:43.170 --> 16:48.717
But, for Chester, that just paid the bills
for the theoretical stuff he was interested in.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.470
- Which was what?
- Researching dark matter.

16:51.553 --> 16:55.390
Quantum particles, neutrinos,
gluons, mesons, quarks.

16:55.474 --> 16:59.144
- Subatomic particles.
- The mysteries of the universe.

16:59.228 --> 17:03.857
- The very building blocks of reality.
- Except no one knows if they exist.

17:03.941 --> 17:06.026
Chester was sure they did.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.819
So sure, he bet his life on it.

17:12.907 --> 17:18.288
This is where it happened. Chester
was working to isolate a new particle.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.626
- He'd been working on it for a year.
- This is a particle accelerator.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.713
One fifth the power of the Texas
Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart.

17:26.797 --> 17:29.758
- Powered by what?
- A couple of billion megawatts.

17:29.842 --> 17:33.929
- Virginia Power loved us.
- Exactly what happened here?

17:34.012 --> 17:37.975
The work involved bombarding
beta particles with an alpha target...

17:38.058 --> 17:40.060
...negative against positive.

17:40.143 --> 17:45.983
Chester had started the countdown
when he realised he'd made a mistake.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.319
Something needed readjusting
in the target room.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.698
Except you can't stop
the countdown once you've begun.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.659
There was time to safely make the change...

17:55.742 --> 18:00.247
...but I had left the room for a minute
when Chester decided to go in.

18:01.290 --> 18:06.461
I didn't realise until it was too late
that the door had locked behind him.

18:22.728 --> 18:24.813
Look at this.

18:25.230 --> 18:29.610
As far as I can tell, it burned
Chester's shadow right into the wall.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.988
- How did he survive?
- All I can figure is...

18:33.071 --> 18:36.783
...the quanta liberated off the target
have virtually no mass.

18:36.867 --> 18:40.662
- They slid right through his body.
- Like getting an X-ray.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.123
A two-billion-megawatt X-ray.

18:43.207 --> 18:46.293
When I saw on the monitor
what was happening...

18:46.376 --> 18:49.588
...that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.924
I cut the power, but it was too late.

18:52.758 --> 18:56.053
I remember looking, and... seeing Chester.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.932
He was perfectly calm...

19:00.015 --> 19:02.309
...almost like he wanted it to happen.

19:02.851 --> 19:07.022
Like he was finally going to experience
the dark matter he had theorised...

19:07.105 --> 19:09.483
...in some kind of physical way.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.320
As if the truth might come into him.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.117
Excuse me.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.079
What do you think, Scully?

19:23.497 --> 19:28.627
Well, this looks like the same kind of
material found at the other crime scenes.

19:28.961 --> 19:32.464
Maybe it is some kind of
spontaneous human combustion.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.633
I'm less convinced of that now.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.928
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

19:38.428 --> 19:44.268
Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of
Dr Chester Banton. Maybe even part of him.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.813
Well, whatever it is,
we have to find him.

19:47.896 --> 19:51.149
I know of only one place to start lookin'.

20:08.542 --> 20:12.713
There's no sign of him, Mulder.
Maybe he's moved on.

20:13.672 --> 20:18.010
- What are you looking at?
- On the tape, he kept staring at the floor.

20:18.093 --> 20:21.346
I'm trying to figure out
what he might have been looking at.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.099
Maybe the exposure affected his mind.

20:24.183 --> 20:28.145
Nonsensical repetitive behaviour
is common in mental illness.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.314
You trying to tell me something?

20:31.732 --> 20:37.863
I called Detective Ryan. She's having the
prints on the bulbs checked against Banton's.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.157
Did you tell her about his accident?

20:40.240 --> 20:45.871
No. I only told her he was a possible suspect,
and that it was too early to get her hopes up.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.957
And that we have more
questions than answers.

20:49.041 --> 20:53.045
- Like?
- Like a motive. Like a murder weapon.

20:53.128 --> 20:55.506
- Like...
- What if Dr Banton...

20:56.089 --> 20:59.092
Look here. There are
hardly any shadows cast.

20:59.176 --> 21:02.596
- What do you mean?
- The lighting in here is diffused.

21:02.679 --> 21:06.725
Soft light. What if that's what
Dr Banton was looking for?

21:06.808 --> 21:08.894
Looking for his shadow?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.779
Dr Banton.

21:41.552 --> 21:43.804
Stop right there!

21:44.096 --> 21:46.181
Dr Banton!

21:51.019 --> 21:53.814
Please... just leave me alone.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.358
We're federal agents, Dr Banton.

21:56.441 --> 21:59.736
You don't understand.
You're making a big mistake.

22:00.946 --> 22:03.031
Stay away from me.

22:05.826 --> 22:07.411
Wait!

22:08.036 --> 22:10.914
It'll kill you. It doesn't care who you are.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.717
Oh, thank God!

22:39.067 --> 22:42.779
- I thought he was to be kept in the dark.
- He insisted on soft light.

22:42.863 --> 22:46.200
It's the only way he'd let us open the door.

23:04.218 --> 23:08.889
How can you even... begin
to understand what it's like?

23:08.972 --> 23:13.060
- We're trying to understand.
- Living in a train station day and night.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.604
Living like a bum.

23:15.687 --> 23:19.107
Afraid to fall asleep
because of what might happen.

23:20.317 --> 23:23.445
The accident in the lab,
the quantum bombardment.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.490
You believe that altered you physically?

23:26.573 --> 23:29.159
You could... You could say that.

23:29.243 --> 23:31.328
Can you tell us how?

23:32.955 --> 23:35.666
Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.

23:36.792 --> 23:42.464
- But it has something to do with dark matter.
- It has everything to do with dark matter.

23:42.548 --> 23:44.633
My shadow...

23:45.467 --> 23:47.553
...isn't mine.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.640
It's... It's like a black hole.

23:51.723 --> 23:54.685
It splits molecules into component atoms.

23:54.768 --> 24:00.524
It unzips electrons from their orbits,
reduces matter into pure energy.

24:00.941 --> 24:04.695
- That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?
- It wasn't me.

24:05.696 --> 24:07.906
Gail Anne was my colleague.

24:08.991 --> 24:11.076
She...

24:13.370 --> 24:16.915
The night after the accident, I went to see her.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.837
I was just standing in the doorway.

24:23.505 --> 24:27.092
I was... I was looking right at her.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.013
And then she was gone.

24:31.889 --> 24:34.016
You have no control over it?

24:34.099 --> 24:38.854
If I could control it, do you think
I would let it go around killing people?

24:40.647 --> 24:42.733
All I can do is...

24:43.525 --> 24:45.319
...study it.

24:45.402 --> 24:49.239
Try and divine its...
its true nature before they do.

24:49.823 --> 24:51.909
They?

24:52.868 --> 24:54.953
The government.

24:59.583 --> 25:01.668
They're after me.

25:03.212 --> 25:05.297
And when they find me...

25:06.256 --> 25:10.552
...they're going to do the brain suck
they've just been dying to do.

25:12.429 --> 25:15.265
"Brain suck"? For the purpose of?

25:15.516 --> 25:20.270
For the purpose of stealing what
has taken me years to accomplish.

25:20.354 --> 25:23.106
And don't think
they wouldn't kill to get it.

25:23.190 --> 25:26.401
But if they killed you,
wouldn't your shadow just...

25:26.485 --> 25:28.987
Disappear? Who knows?

25:34.201 --> 25:36.745
That's why you have to get me out of here.

25:38.205 --> 25:43.961
If I die... there could be
nothing left to tether this thing.

25:44.211 --> 25:46.713
Excuse me.

25:46.797 --> 25:51.176
I'm gonna have to ask you to
discontinue interrogating the suspect.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.817
This is Detective Barron,
the primary on this case.

26:06.900 --> 26:11.071
- I was wondering what your involvement is.
- We caught the guy.

26:11.154 --> 26:16.743
I appreciate that. But no one seems to
recall inviting the FBI in on this case.

26:16.827 --> 26:20.163
Agent Mulder and I are here
in an unofficial capacity.

26:20.247 --> 26:22.332
Then who brought you in?

26:24.001 --> 26:27.963
We were curious about
the unexplained nature of the case.

26:28.922 --> 26:32.217
Banton's prints place him
at two of the crime scenes.

26:32.301 --> 26:37.389
And Transit Authority tapes show him in the
vicinity of two of the most recent victims.

26:37.472 --> 26:43.187
- I'd say this case is pretty much explained.
- Really? Have you talked to Dr Banton?

26:43.270 --> 26:47.107
Don't try to interrogate me,
Agent Mulder. I'm not the suspect.

26:47.191 --> 26:51.278
You know nothing about this case,
so you stuck it with Detective Ryan.

26:51.361 --> 26:56.658
- Let her decide how to proceed.
- She is handling this case. She's done well.

26:56.742 --> 27:01.455
I see no reason not to let her prosecute it
once the prisoner has been transferred.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.624
Transferred? Where?

27:04.082 --> 27:06.543
To the city jail, for his arraignment.

27:06.627 --> 27:10.130
I don't think you appreciate
the danger that he poses.

27:10.214 --> 27:15.594
I don't think you have the authority to tell me
or anyone else in my unit how to do our job.

27:17.846 --> 27:20.599
I think we can handle it
from here, Agent Mulder.

27:20.682 --> 27:24.561
We'll call you if there's
anything more you can do.

27:24.645 --> 27:26.730
Come on, Mulder. Let's go.

27:29.233 --> 27:32.361
Soft light. He needs soft light.

27:35.239 --> 27:40.494
I hope you know what you're doing, putting
Detective Ryan's ambition over good sense.

27:40.577 --> 27:44.373
Ambition? She's a woman
trying to survive the boys' club.

27:44.456 --> 27:48.836
- Believe me, I know how she feels.
- You never put yourself ahead of your work.

27:48.919 --> 27:51.088
And that's what's happening here.

27:51.171 --> 27:55.592
Look, the fact is, we have no jurisdiction
here. We were called in as a favour.

27:55.676 --> 27:58.554
And we just handed the A-bomb
to the Boy Scouts.

27:58.637 --> 28:00.931
I'm sure precautions will be taken.

28:01.014 --> 28:06.436
I'm sure Robert Oppenheimer heard that from
the same government Dr Banton is afraid of.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.231
You believe this paranoia
about brain sucking?

28:09.314 --> 28:12.526
That man is scared,
and not just of his own shadow.

28:12.609 --> 28:16.446
As brilliant as Dr Banton may be,
he is also clearly delusional.

28:16.530 --> 28:22.786
- He shows almost every textbook indicator.
- We've both seen the physical evidence.

28:22.870 --> 28:27.165
Look, I don't know how to explain it.
But that's not our job.

28:27.249 --> 28:29.793
I don't know what else we should do.

28:30.419 --> 28:32.921
I think I do.

29:11.376 --> 29:14.338
All you've given me is a name.
Chester Ray Banton.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.925
- Dr Chester Ray Banton. Do you know him?
- No. Should I?

29:18.008 --> 29:22.554
He's being held by the police
in connection with several bizarre murders.

29:22.638 --> 29:27.017
He's a physicist, researching
quarks, gluons... Dark matter.

29:27.976 --> 29:33.690
- He thinks the government is out to get him.
- It's tax season. So do most Americans.

29:33.774 --> 29:37.194
- He believes his life is in danger.
- Is he a dangerous man?

29:37.277 --> 29:37.611
Yes.

29:37.653 --> 29:39.363
Yes.

29:39.947 --> 29:43.492
- Where is he being held?
- Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital.

29:43.575 --> 29:47.204
- But not for long.
- I'm afraid I can't help you.

29:47.287 --> 29:50.874
- Why?
- Last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist...

29:50.958 --> 29:55.212
...and regrettably exposed my identity
to associates of yours.

29:55.295 --> 29:59.383
Yes, I know. And you can trust them
as you trust me, I promise.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.593
Dead men can't keep promises.

30:02.511 --> 30:06.056
The next time, the blood
and regret could be yours.

30:06.139 --> 30:08.809
I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder.

30:08.892 --> 30:12.729
I have nothing to gain and
everything to lose by helping you.

30:12.813 --> 30:17.109
Promise you won't contact me again
unless absolutely necessary.

30:24.575 --> 30:26.660
I promise.

30:57.107 --> 30:59.902
Frank, are your lights on? Ours just went...

31:02.404 --> 31:05.991
Hi. We're here to transfer
Chester Ray Banton.

31:06.742 --> 31:09.620
I have orders he's being
transferred tomorrow.

31:09.703 --> 31:14.082
Due to the power outage,
there's been a change of plans.

31:14.416 --> 31:17.336
No one's supposed to go in there!

31:27.930 --> 31:30.015
Here.

31:31.475 --> 31:33.560
Quickly.

31:35.521 --> 31:36.980
Who are you?

31:37.064 --> 31:39.358
No. Don't do this.

31:39.441 --> 31:42.110
Please, no. No, don't. Leave me alone.

32:56.894 --> 33:01.523
- What did you find out, Scully?
- Richmond PD had two officers outside.

33:01.607 --> 33:05.777
- They didn't see anybody come in.
- The nurse said there were three men.

33:05.861 --> 33:07.654
Three?

33:08.488 --> 33:11.992
The power was disconnected
at a substation two blocks away.

33:12.075 --> 33:14.453
Somebody posing as a city engineer.

33:14.536 --> 33:20.000
Somebody who knew how to take it off the
grid without affecting surrounding facilities.

33:20.083 --> 33:23.420
Somebody from the government
coming for Dr Banton?

33:23.504 --> 33:25.923
Being paranoid doesn't mean he's wrong.

33:26.006 --> 33:29.343
But my guess is they failed,
and Dr Banton's on the loose.

33:29.426 --> 33:32.721
- That's what Detective Ryan thinks.
- I just saw her.

33:32.804 --> 33:37.559
She was in charge of his transfer and
arraignment. She's in some pretty hot water.

33:37.643 --> 33:41.271
Maybe that was an appointment
he wasn't meant to keep. Let's go.

33:41.355 --> 33:46.693
- Where? Mulder, wait. Where are we going?
- You heard what Dr Banton said last night.

33:46.777 --> 33:49.655
- He said a lot of things.
- Put yourself in his head.

33:49.738 --> 33:54.117
He hasn't killed himself only because
he's afraid of releasing the dark matter.

33:54.201 --> 33:57.120
That's just a theory,
and a pretty wild one at that.

33:57.204 --> 34:01.834
Whether or not Dr Banton is actually
telling the truth, he believes he is.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.878
And so does whoever tried
to take him last night.

34:04.962 --> 34:07.881
All he's tried to do is control this thing.

34:07.965 --> 34:13.344
He'll go to the one place where he thinks
he can do that. And we gotta get there first.

34:33.824 --> 34:37.452
Don't turn on the light, Chris,
unless you wanna die.

34:37.536 --> 34:39.788
Chester, what the hell is going on?

34:39.871 --> 34:43.000
The FBI are looking for you.
Where have you been?

34:43.083 --> 34:46.170
There's no time to explain.
Just come with me.

34:46.253 --> 34:50.924
- What's this about? Talk to me.
- We found the dark matter, Chris. It's real.

34:51.007 --> 34:54.887
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand? I'm it.

34:54.969 --> 34:59.224
- It's... It's in me.
- The accident?

34:59.683 --> 35:04.271
They're coming for me. We have to
destroy this thing before they get here.

35:04.354 --> 35:06.440
No! You can't go back in there!

35:06.523 --> 35:10.569
Police! I'm placing you
under arrest, Dr Banton.

35:11.153 --> 35:15.073
- A lot of people will die if you do this.
- Step against the wall, sir.

35:16.116 --> 35:19.203
I'm begging you. I don't wanna hurt you.

35:19.494 --> 35:22.247
I said step against the wall.

35:22.331 --> 35:24.333
Now!

35:31.882 --> 35:33.800
I'm sorry.

35:43.894 --> 35:46.480
Let's go. We don't have much time.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.337
- Chester!
- No matter what they say to you later...

36:10.420 --> 36:12.506
...you're doing the right thing.

36:16.844 --> 36:18.929
Lock it up, Chris.

36:23.642 --> 36:26.395
All right. Let's get the accelerator on line.

36:26.478 --> 36:28.564
I'm afraid not, Chester.

36:30.732 --> 36:34.111
- You can do it, Chris.
- I can.

36:34.194 --> 36:36.280
But I'm not.

36:37.739 --> 36:41.076
No! Chris, tell me
you're not working for them.

36:41.743 --> 36:44.746
- Wish I could, Chester.
- You son of a bitch!

36:44.830 --> 36:49.585
- Careful. We don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'll die before I'll let them use me!

36:49.877 --> 36:54.381
You're lightning in a bottle, Chester.
We're not about to let you die.

36:59.553 --> 37:02.472
Chris, don't do this. Listen to me!

37:02.556 --> 37:04.641
This is wrong!

37:04.808 --> 37:07.019
You're making a terrible mistake!

37:07.269 --> 37:11.064
I've got him. He's not goin'
anywhere till you pick him up.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.404
Chris!

37:17.487 --> 37:20.532
Chris? Chris! What's happening?

37:22.075 --> 37:24.161
Chris! Chris...

37:39.009 --> 37:43.514
- Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.
- I was afraid of this.

37:48.685 --> 37:50.771
Mulder.

37:52.523 --> 37:54.858
Dammit.

38:02.324 --> 38:04.409
What's that noise?

38:04.868 --> 38:06.954
It's the accelerator.

38:22.845 --> 38:24.930
Mulder!

38:44.283 --> 38:46.577
Scully, look at this.

38:51.373 --> 38:54.543
He must have killed her
and then killed himself.

38:54.626 --> 38:58.755
He couldn't have. This chamber's
been sealed from the outside.

38:59.590 --> 39:01.133
By who?

39:33.040 --> 39:35.250
Agent Mulder.

39:39.671 --> 39:42.799
I thought you agreed
not to contact me again about this.

39:42.883 --> 39:44.885
- You lied to me.
- About?

39:44.968 --> 39:48.472
About Chester Ray Banton.
You knew who he was.

39:48.555 --> 39:52.684
- And you used me to lead you to him.
- You contacted me, Agent Mulder.

39:52.768 --> 39:55.854
I won't be your stalking-horse,
or the government's.

39:55.938 --> 40:00.692
You seem to be mistaken about how much
control you exercise over this arrangement.

40:00.776 --> 40:03.529
You killed Dr Banton!

40:03.612 --> 40:07.199
- Have you lost your mind?
- The nurse identified you.

40:07.282 --> 40:09.910
A young detective is dead because of you.

40:09.993 --> 40:12.079
Who do you answer to?!

40:15.832 --> 40:18.585
Despite my loyalty to my predecessor...

40:18.669 --> 40:21.922
...I've never made you any promises.

40:22.256 --> 40:25.050
All right. Promise me somethin' right now.

40:25.509 --> 40:29.721
Promise me this'll be
our last meeting. We're finished.

40:29.805 --> 40:33.851
You're choosing a dangerous time
to go it alone, Agent Mulder.

40:36.353 --> 40:38.438
Mulder!

40:43.235 --> 40:45.320
I didn't kill him.

41:05.924 --> 41:10.929
The mourners are invited to pay their
respects to the family at the Ryan home.

41:51.094 --> 41:55.307
- How are you doin'?
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder.

41:55.432 --> 41:58.393
She was my student, and
she came to me for help.

42:00.979 --> 42:04.566
- I know it must be hard.
- This shouldn't have happened.

42:05.526 --> 42:07.694
This never should have happened.

42:09.446 --> 42:12.991
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the Richmond PD.

42:13.075 --> 42:16.411
- Doing what?
- A missing-person report was filed...

42:16.495 --> 42:21.375
...by a Dr Morris West, a physicist
affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.

42:21.458 --> 42:23.585
I'm not sure I follow you.

42:23.669 --> 42:29.049
Dr Christopher Davey hasn't been seen
or heard from since Banton disappeared.

42:29.132 --> 42:32.594
- Do they have any leads?
- No. None.

42:32.845 --> 42:34.555
But you do?

42:34.638 --> 42:38.475
What if it wasn't Banton we saw
in the particle accelerator?

42:38.559 --> 42:42.229
Well, if Banton's not dead,
then where is he?

43:09.173 --> 43:12.009
Dr Davey would have been helpful to us.

43:12.176 --> 43:14.887
We'll be studying this man for a long time.

43:45.154 --> 43:58.989
