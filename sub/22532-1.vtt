The prophecy said
if we activate the Sortis Crystal

02:24.920 --> 02:27.446
inside the temple,
we could destroy Sun Snatcher.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.967
Perhaps there's a lesson here, Brigsby.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.247
When solving for "X"
on a one-dimensional plane

02:33.400 --> 02:37.450

of one equals minus X,

02:37.760 --> 02:39.524
always solve for the vector R.

Hey, guys. James here.
First of all. Episode 34, Volume 25,

03:23.480 --> 03:28.680
I put the recap up, so there is already
a great comment section there,

03:28.760 --> 03:31.604
and I recommend all you guys
go check that out immediately

03:31.760 --> 03:34.240
Also, as some of you guys know,

03:34.320 --> 03:37.080
I've been studying the old Brigsby volumes,

03:37.160 --> 03:39.440
going way back to the first Quest Wars,

03:39.520 --> 03:42.760
when we initially meet
the evildoer himself, aka Sun Snatcher.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.002
Obviously, Snatcher always gets away.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.080
But Brigsby never gives up,
and I'm not giving up either,

03:49.160 --> 03:50.889
and I have actually come up
with some new ideas

03:51.000 --> 03:53.002
that I really want to tell you guys about.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.282
But I... I'm not... Let's just say...

03:55.600 --> 03:58.126
Let us say that
I'm onto something pretty big.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.243
So stay tuned for that, and, of course,
as always, until our next adventure.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.846
So basically, the trick is Brigsby needs
to find all the sacred artifacts.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.120
Sortis Crystal.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.171
Arielle's amulet.

04:18.360 --> 04:22.843
Then you just need to find
a collapsed star in an unclaimed system.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.169
Easier said than done, I know.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.850
(LAUGHS)

04:27.280 --> 04:33.242
If you could find the unclaimed system,
Brigsby could finally defeat Sun Snatcher.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.400
Thank you.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.960
TOGETHER:
...and may our minds be stronger tomorrow.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.364
I know there's still some things
I need to add before I post it.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.331
What is it?

04:51.560 --> 04:52.971
Well, pal, (SIGHS)

04:54.000 --> 04:56.571
it's clear a lot of imagination went into it.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.250
But the thing is, I'm not sure
how any of this is plausible

05:00.360 --> 05:01.440
in Brigsby's universe.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.808
I mean, you have him using
Arielle's amulet against Snatcher.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.766
Sure, it's powerful.
It was created by the Drumbas,

05:07.920 --> 05:11.641
but, if I remember correctly,
it's very unstable.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.360
But not if you fold space-time.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.040
See, I didn't get to explain that
part but that's why

05:16.120 --> 05:18.280
- Brigsby needs Arielle's amulet.
- James.

But all of this time
that you've been spending

05:25.200 --> 05:29.400
on the Brigsby forum and your projects,
we just don't see the point.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.400
- The point?
- You could be using this time and energy

05:32.480 --> 05:35.960
to further your studies
or solve the Vansmithe conjecture.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.680
But it's impossible. And it's stupid.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.082

20:47.120 --> 20:48.280
- Good one.
- Yeah.

20:48.360 --> 20:52.285
- Swimming. In a pool and out at the lake.
- Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.200
Oh, oh. Canoeing.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.640
- Skipping rocks.
- You're on fire.

20:57.720 --> 20:58.920
Fly fishing.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.320
Why are you guys
so all about water right now?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.004
You're, like, freaking him out.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.161
Well, I'll just balance the list out
with a bunch of land activities, too.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.124
And, James, you can choose to do
whichever ones you like.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.329
Guess I'd just like to watch
the new Brigsby tape, if that's okay.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.245
Brigsby tape?

21:19.480 --> 21:20.811
(SCOFFS)

21:25.600 --> 21:28.968
Seriously, though. Has it come in yet?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.650
- I don't know what that is.
- Yeah.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.040
Look. See. It was delivered
to our supply drop every week.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.960
Volume 14, episode 20.
"Making Friends with the Wizzles."

21:39.040 --> 21:41.327
GREG: Huh. Real cool.
LOUISE: Yeah.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.080
You know, you need a VCR for this,
which we don't have.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.480
But I bet Pop-Pop Daryl's box
is in the basement.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.960
We could probably find a VCR.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.320
Well, you know, in the meantime
there's a bunch of other shows

21:51.400 --> 21:53.562
that we can watch
on our television right now.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.164
So, they make other shows?

21:57.480 --> 22:00.290
- (LAUGHTER ON TV)
- GREG: Oh, look, there's a funny family.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.482
Or a dance contest.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.203
Or... Ah, Fancy Cakes.

22:09.520 --> 22:13.840
Here. Why don't you try to drive, okay?
This is how you scroll up and down.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.641
And then you just press select
when you like something. Couch potato.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.200
Thank you.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.080
NEWSCASTER: ...incredible story out of Utah.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.208
A young man reunited with his family

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
- after being abducted...
- Oh, God.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.360
- ...from Cedar Hills.
- Here. Let's watch something else.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.960
- The alleged kidnappers...
- GREG: Shit, shit.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.440
...are a former city college
professor April Mitchum

22:33.520 --> 22:36.444
and her husband Ted, the artist and designer

22:36.600 --> 22:40.640
behind the wildly popular 80's toy,
Terrence the Tiger.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.202
The couple are being charged
with felony kidnapping and imprison...

22:44.920 --> 22:45.921
There.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.402
So, I think maybe it's my bedtime.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.569
You guys probably need to turn off
the generator anyway, right?

22:55.720 --> 22:57.160
Uh... I...

22:57.240 --> 22:58.920
We don't really have bedtimes here.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.970
But you're welcome to go to your room
whenever you want.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.002
We're on an electrical grid.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.644
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

23:27.320 --> 23:28.560
Oh, sorry.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.804
What are you doing?

23:32.400 --> 23:34.368
I really like those rhythms.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.846
What?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.409
The music rhythms...

23:40.240 --> 23:41.287
Okay.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.091
(SONG PLAYING)

24:00.080 --> 24:01.570
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

24:02.800 --> 24:03.801
GREG: James?

24:05.840 --> 24:08.923
Hey, I took today off from work.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.480
I was thinking maybe
me and you could have some fun.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.522
I got a surprise planned.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.001
MAN: (ON SCREEN) Tell me where it says

24:37.120 --> 24:39.560
you're not allowed to bite someone
in the rule book.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.449
Yep, there it is. You're right.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.971
(ALL LAUGHING)

24:43.120 --> 24:45.487
Hey, Coach Brad,
I think I found your problem.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.200
Your car's a piece of crap.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.600
Hey, Gordo,
how about next time you take the bus.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.681
You wish.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.127
How am I supposed to find somebody
by Saturday...

24:54.160 --> 24:57.080
Seth, I think I have to call you back.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.120
Hey, wait up! Hey, where you going?

25:00.200 --> 25:02.043
Hey, you're not in trouble.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.930
Take off your helmet.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.600
BOY: A girl?

25:17.960 --> 25:21.640
Yeah, a girl.
Hannah Slice, as a matter of fact.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.440
Where in the heck did you learn
to shoot a puck like that?

25:25.520 --> 25:27.480
And remember when the one called Gordo...

25:27.560 --> 25:28.800
When he ate all that cake,

25:28.920 --> 25:30.880
and then he slipped and fell on his backside?

25:30.960 --> 25:33.645
- Remember that?
- Yeah. Sure, that was pretty funny.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.366
It was different than Brigsby 'cause

25:36.560 --> 25:40.120
there weren't any spells,
it was just one long adventure.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.720
But, you should...
(STAMMERS) If you had seen it...

25:42.800 --> 25:45.120
It was just on a gigantic screen.

25:45.200 --> 25:50.809
Yeah. Hey, since you brought up Brigsby,
maybe we could talk about that. Yeah?

25:51.400 --> 25:54.131
I think that's a great idea.
Thank you, Mrs. Pope.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.330
Wait, who is that?

25:57.480 --> 25:58.880
Um...

25:58.960 --> 26:01.611
My name is Emily. Remember?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.683
No, I know, but what is this?

26:04.320 --> 26:06.641
Having to meet with you, what...
What's going on?

26:07.200 --> 26:10.280
Well, your parents and I thought
it might help if we got together

26:10.360 --> 26:13.443
every once in a while to just talk.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.240
Okay, but why though?

26:16.320 --> 26:19.120
Because that's what I do. I help people.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.720
Everyone says they're trying to help me

26:20.800 --> 26:23.280
but nobody can find me
the new episode of Brigsby.

26:23.360 --> 26:27.922
Well, first of all,
there wasn't a new episode this week.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.522
- (SCOFFS) That's impossible.
- James.

26:32.080 --> 26:36.165
(SIGHS)
The way that the police found you was...

26:36.280 --> 26:38.760
Someone spotted Ted going into a warehouse

26:38.840 --> 26:42.128
about 40 miles outside of
where he was holding you captive.

26:42.720 --> 26:48.640
And inside that warehouse,
they found a television stage of a cabin,

26:48.720 --> 26:51.121
with props and puppets.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.561
Do you see where I'm going with this?

26:56.200 --> 26:57.281
Brigsby stuff?

26:58.600 --> 27:01.968
My dad... My old...
My old dad actually got to go there?

27:02.520 --> 27:03.726
James...

27:04.640 --> 27:08.690
Ted Mitchum, your captor,

27:10.120 --> 27:13.727
he was the one making the show.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.284
James?

27:23.800 --> 27:24.961
(YELLS) Yes!

27:25.080 --> 27:28.323
My dad or my old dad, he knew Brigsby?

27:29.040 --> 27:31.400
I think you're missing the point here, okay?

27:31.480 --> 27:34.360
He was the one who was deciding
what Brigsby would do next?

27:34.440 --> 27:35.560
That's right.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.960
Did it have... Did they figure out

27:38.040 --> 27:39.804
who's going to take over doing it?

27:40.120 --> 27:42.361
EMILY: No one's taking over doing it.

27:44.040 --> 27:47.123
You're the only person
who's ever seen the show.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.363
But I have friends

27:50.480 --> 27:53.563
on the Brigsby Bearfan forum
that watched it on my computer.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.560
Well, the computer at your old home
was run on a closed network.

27:58.640 --> 28:02.850
So, any content there we can assume
was created by Ted and April.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.282
So, Brigsby Boy One,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.241
Brigsby Boy Two, Brigsby Boy Three...

28:14.520 --> 28:16.080
They weren't real?

28:16.160 --> 28:18.162
I'm sorry, James, no.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.924
What about Brigsby Girl?

28:26.240 --> 28:28.000
I know this isn't easy.

28:28.080 --> 28:31.000
And there are going to be
some really deep emotions

28:31.080 --> 28:32.680
associated with this transition.

28:32.760 --> 28:36.640
And we're so excited
to help you get back on track,

28:36.720 --> 28:39.480
and, you know,
we're going to have so much fun.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.720
You're not even going to remember
some old TV show.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.370
EMILY: So, what do you think, James?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.847
Do you have any other questions?

28:49.680 --> 28:50.806
Yeah.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.684
Who made Hockey High?

28:54.960 --> 28:56.246
Uh...

28:57.080 --> 29:00.289
I think it was the guy who did
Sir Bachelor. Is that the name of it?

29:00.440 --> 29:02.841
- Mr. Bachelor.
- Mr. Bachelor.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.850
Does he do all the movies?

29:06.880 --> 29:08.211
No... Uh...

29:08.920 --> 29:12.920
There are lots of different directors
who make lots of different movies.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.490
LOUISE: (SOFTLY) Yeah.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.685
Can anyone do it?

29:17.600 --> 29:18.931
GREG: Sure.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.689

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

30:04.680 --> 30:05.966
Hey.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.241
Hey.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.731
So, I'm going to my school's football game
with a couple of people.

30:13.400 --> 30:18.804
And if that's something you wanted
to go to, then you're invited.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.440
But you totally don't have to.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.800
Is that the thing with the mean guys
in the mask where they get mad?

30:23.880 --> 30:26.884
Exactly. It's really stupid.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.640
And...

30:29.720 --> 30:33.202
And do you want... Do you want me to
come to it? Or is it something...

30:34.400 --> 30:35.845
LOUISE: Aubrey?

30:37.120 --> 30:38.963
Yeah, I guess.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.611
(HORN HONKS)

30:46.160 --> 30:48.845
Okay, so look.
We're not going to a football game.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.849
- We're not?
- Uh, no.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.280
This kid, his parents are out of town.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.807
So, he's having a couple people over.
It should be totally fine, but...

30:58.600 --> 31:00.125
Just be normal, all right?

31:00.560 --> 31:03.040
And don't tell anyone how old you are,

31:03.360 --> 31:05.567
that we're related.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.044
- What's up?
- Hey, man.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.285
- Sorry.
- It's cool.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.450
Hey, I'm Merideth.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.202
- Hi.
- That's James.

31:16.720 --> 31:20.160
Yeah, I saw you on the news, man. It's crazy.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.730
You like Cedar Hills?

31:23.200 --> 31:24.645
I like movies.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.684
Yeah, exactly.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.640
AUBREY: Yeah, I don't know.
Matt keeps texting me, but...

31:31.720 --> 31:32.840
I like him for you.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.241
- Are you going to hang out?
- Yeah, I don't know.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.967

Yo, finally. Jesus.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.325
- I know.
- Come on, bring it in.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.160
You guys feeling a try to buy?

- Wanna touch 'em?
- It's all right.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.600
Hey Spence, you got any shit on you?

31:57.680 --> 32:00.240
No, but Logan's around.
So you can go check with him.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.880
And your kegs are out back.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.485
- Thank you.
- Sure.

Hey, what's up, man? I'm Spence.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.044
Is that some kind of Bear Speeder?

32:19.360 --> 32:20.361
What?

32:20.560 --> 32:23.920
Is that some kind of Bear Speeder
or a Stealodrone Rider on your shirt?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.844
Yeah, no.
It's, you know, Enterprise and Trek shit.

32:31.600 --> 32:35.321
My parents stole me when I was a baby,
but I still think they are pretty cool.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.925
(LAUGHS)

32:39.120 --> 32:40.121
That's tight.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.560

32:43.640 --> 32:45.240
Yes, I would like one of that.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.006
Hi.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.847
Hi, I'm James. I really like your clothes.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.604
Hey, man, everything good?

33:23.400 --> 33:26.210
Yeah. Just meeting some new people.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.480
Dude, yeah, I don't even know
who those guys are.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.609
I mean, they look like dicks.
All right? Don't worry about them.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.089
I told them I liked their clothes but...

33:36.200 --> 33:39.522
Actually, I think maybe... I think maybe
I like my clothes a bit more.

33:40.280 --> 33:43.124
Hey, you're... You're Aubrey's brother.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.600
Right? And you were...

33:45.680 --> 33:48.440
You were stuck in the same house
for, like, your whole life?

33:48.520 --> 33:50.488
- I went on the roof sometimes.
- (CHUCKLES)

33:50.880 --> 33:52.211
That's a good call, dude.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.045
Well, cheers. To...

Hey, this is your first party, right?

- Dude, let's turn up, bro, cheers.
- Yeah.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.680
- Turn up. Let's turn up.
- Turn up!

34:05.760 --> 34:08.331
But this is before the collapse
of the third federation

34:08.440 --> 34:10.960
when everything changes
and Brigsby becomes an outlaw.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.800
But he's still a good guy,
even though now he's got to...

34:13.880 --> 34:16.080
Now he's gotta work
with the Stardust Bandits.

34:16.159 --> 34:19.159
So, sorry, what are we talking about here?
Like a trained bear?

34:19.239 --> 34:20.400
- Brigsby?
- Yeah.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.159
Yeah. He's trained in space combat,
puzzle solving, quest.

34:23.239 --> 34:25.400
And I guess he also happens
to be the best version of yourself

34:25.480 --> 34:28.760
via series of life instructional lessons.
Plus he's got rainbow eyes too.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.120
How do the rainbow eyes work?

34:30.199 --> 34:32.400
It's... I don't know.
If you ever need a rainbow,

34:32.480 --> 34:34.239
- you get a rainbow.
- That's insane. I love it.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.960
Yeah, it's insane. I love it, yeah.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.643
So, does it fix people?

34:37.760 --> 34:40.199
Yeah. It provides an energy and positivity

34:40.280 --> 34:42.159
that will make anything come to life,
I guess.

34:42.239 --> 34:44.040
That's amazing.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.770
How many episodes?

34:45.920 --> 34:48.924
It's 25 volumes, 736 episodes total.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.646
If you ever want to see it,
I've got it on tape, too.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.964
Dude, please. That'd be dope as shit.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.805
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty dope as shit.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.922
- Hey, James, do you want one of these?
- Yeah.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.240
Also did I say that
there's going to be a movie?

35:08.320 --> 35:09.680
- What?
- Yeah, I'm making it.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.250
I'm making a Brigsby movie.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.084
- Nice, man.
- That's awesome!

35:13.400 --> 35:15.721
- Dude, can I be in it?
- Yeah, well, we'll see.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.402
You guys are in it. We'll see about you.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.283
I'm just kidding. Yes, I want you in it.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.968
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)

35:42.160 --> 35:44.162
(MUSIC FADING)

35:50.720 --> 35:52.085
Are you okay?

35:55.480 --> 35:57.084
Let's go sit down.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.686
Sit here. All right. Careful.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.961
Here you go. Here, drink this.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.001
Don't worry.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.920
My first time rolling
was intense, too, but...

36:26.000 --> 36:27.120
(CLEARS THROAT)

36:27.200 --> 36:31.364
Once you just relax and let go,
it feels really nice.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.166
I'm not used to it.

36:37.560 --> 36:41.167
There's probably a lot of stuff
you've never done, huh?

36:44.440 --> 36:45.885
I guess so.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.405
(EXHALES)

36:52.400 --> 36:54.641
Have you ever been with a girl?

36:55.040 --> 36:58.010
Mmm-hmm. On the Internet.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.324
But that was really just my first parents
playing tricks on me.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.129
Just... Just relax.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.760
(GASPS)

37:38.840 --> 37:41.844
That feels very... That feels very nice.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.360
Thank you for...
Thank you for what you're doing.

37:45.440 --> 37:46.771
That feels very good.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.524
(BOTH PANTING)

37:52.280 --> 37:53.645
Thank you for that! Goodbye.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.321
Thank you for that.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.611
(DOOR CLOSES)

37:58.760 --> 37:59.761
- James!
- Sorry.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.880
James. What are you doing?
You're embarrassing me.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.371
I'm very sorry, Aubrey.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.766
Ahh.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.240
James. Dude, hold on.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.971
Thank you for my first party, Spencer.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.571
How are you possibly this wasted right now?

38:36.200 --> 38:37.850
Stay away from me, Snatcher.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.126
Oh, shit. There he is. (CHUCKLES)

39:18.480 --> 39:21.600
You just started tripping.
You passed out in the backyard.

39:21.680 --> 39:23.160
So, I just brought you in.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.562
And Aubrey talked to your parents,
so you're good, dude.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.564
I'm really very sorry, Mr. Spencer.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.688
Dude, it's just Spence, bro.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.167
- Spence.
- Yeah.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.611
Is this stuff from a show?

39:41.560 --> 39:44.404
Oh, dude, no.
Man, these are the classics, dude.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.040
You got a lot of catching up to do, bro.

Wait, whoa, what's all that?

39:52.960 --> 39:54.246
Oh. Did you do that?

39:54.360 --> 39:57.330
No, this is just some bullshit, I guess.
Well, and...

39:59.720 --> 40:02.644
Yeah, you know, I'm still learning and...

40:03.080 --> 40:05.480
I want to go to college for it or something.

40:05.560 --> 40:09.160
It looks like it's going well,
and maybe you could do more of it.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.321
Yeah.

40:13.320 --> 40:17.800
All right, so these are
the best of volumes 14 to 25.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.560
That's when the show started getting good.

40:19.640 --> 40:22.450
Nice. Oh. Donald Duck's in this shit.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.120
No that's Goody Goose.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.400
He's the top pilot in the Starsquad Alliance.

40:27.480 --> 40:31.087
Well, he looks like Donald Duck.
It's this cartoon character.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.249
Well, it's not. It's Goody Goose.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.449
Yeah, oh and I'll get these to Aubrey
when I'm done. Cool?

40:38.160 --> 40:40.322
- Cool.
- All right, bro.

VOGEL: I'm sorry, James.
Tell me again, what is this for exactly?

40:54.760 --> 40:57.240
That's a list of everything I need
for the Brigsby movie I'm making.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.886
I need all the cameras
from my old dad's Brigsby set.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.610
Any props, costumes, all that.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.331
Oh, also, I need to find the Smile sisters.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.010
Whoever they are in real life.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.089
You guys got the stuff, right?

41:09.240 --> 41:12.720
We do, but it's part of
an ongoing police investigation.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.640
Okay, so after that?

41:14.720 --> 41:17.690
After that it becomes police property.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.567
What do you say
we keep this between you and me?

41:35.360 --> 41:37.203
I can't accept that.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.640
Then I'm taking it back.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.722
- Don't be mad at me.
- I'm not mad.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.564
I'm just a little more rich.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.681
Hello, James.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.083
Still hanging around, huh?

42:12.920 --> 42:16.129
I feel like I wasn't clear earlier
about what I'm trying to do here.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.680
Try to imagine a hero.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.929
And he's not on the bad side,

42:33.560 --> 42:35.085
he's on the good side.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.889
But he has to go against
a guy on the bad side.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.642
So that's why he decides
he's going to go on an adventure.

42:47.760 --> 42:50.001
Plus, it's not on a TV,
it's on a screen so big

42:50.160 --> 42:52.606
you're going to feel like
you're in another world.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.964
Right. No, I know what a movie is.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.922
And I think it's really great to be creative.

43:01.240 --> 43:04.323
I actually performed in a lot of plays
when I was in high school.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.686
- No way.
- Mmm.

But, you know, it's...

43:32.600 --> 43:35.080
That was so good. That was... What?

43:35.160 --> 43:37.840
I didn't have any time to prepare
anything so it was just...

43:37.920 --> 43:41.606
- Thank you.
- No, that was amazing. Do you do theaters?

43:41.720 --> 43:45.880
No, I'm just saying
I know what you're trying to do.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.611
And I think it's...
I think it's great, James.

43:49.720 --> 43:50.721
Why?

43:51.280 --> 43:52.486
Why what?

43:53.240 --> 43:55.447
- Why don't you do it anymore?
- Act?

43:58.960 --> 44:03.807
You know, things change.
You get older, move on.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.650
I do this now.

44:12.200 --> 44:15.204
It's very sad you didn't get to do
what was important to you.

No.

44:54.240 --> 44:56.083
I thought I left my keys in here.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.326
So, what do you think? Uh...

44:59.800 --> 45:01.962
We got World Geography, very fun.

45:02.120 --> 45:05.522
And European History,
which is a lot of action.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.604
Ancient Religions.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.683
Could I learn how to pilot a car?

45:11.160 --> 45:14.721
Yeah. You know, I don't see why not.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.040
Just have to get you a learner's permit.

45:18.120 --> 45:19.640
GREG: Hey, that would be fun.

45:19.720 --> 45:22.600
You're supposed to take a couple classes
and a written test,

45:22.680 --> 45:25.001
but I'd take you out, show you the ropes.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.566
(BELL DINGING)

45:27.720 --> 45:29.640
It sounds like the great chimes of Enow.

45:29.720 --> 45:33.281
Oh, does it? Do you want to answer the door?

45:34.760 --> 45:35.921
James.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.240
Just the man I was looking for.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.129
Wait, where's all your soldier stuff?

45:40.280 --> 45:41.645
Huh? I'm off duty right now.

45:42.520 --> 45:46.120
Now look, there's no way I could get you
everything on that list, all right?

45:46.200 --> 45:49.840
But Forensics does have more evidence
than they know what to do with.

45:49.920 --> 45:53.242
So, I figured they wouldn't miss
a couple items like...

45:53.440 --> 45:55.520
(GASPS) The Sortis Crystal!

45:55.600 --> 45:57.045
That's what I thought.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.040
Yeah, and I found this in back.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.885
- It wasn't on the list, but...
- Bortep's staff!

46:03.040 --> 46:05.320
I thought that was stuck in a time flux.

46:05.400 --> 46:08.210
I don't know what that is
but it's got a nice weight to it.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.688
And last but not least,
one of these bad boys.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.480
That's Brigsby.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.847
Yeah? I assumed.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.528
Look, it holds a cassette in the back.
It's nice.

46:28.280 --> 46:31.240
And is... Do I get to have it?

46:31.320 --> 46:33.320
You could hold on to it.

46:33.400 --> 46:36.080
All right? I'm not technically supposed
to have this stuff.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.606
So, nothing in public, right?

46:38.960 --> 46:42.328
Thank you. This is so dope as shit.

46:43.400 --> 46:44.526
You're welcome.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.601
Yes!

46:47.320 --> 46:48.440
Very dope as shit, huh?

46:48.520 --> 46:50.520
Hey, can you grab some more of the stuff?

46:50.600 --> 46:52.568
- Sure.
- Sorry about that, Mr. Pope.

46:53.200 --> 46:54.884
I hope I wasn't intruding today.

46:56.040 --> 46:57.804
No, not at all.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.445
But I will say,

46:59.560 --> 47:03.320
this transition we've been going through
hasn't exactly been easy, as you know.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.926
Oh, I can imagine.
Listen, I'm just trying to help.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.244
That's the thing, actually.
This Brigsby business...

47:09.680 --> 47:12.650
I realize James is a big fan,
but all this stuff...

47:13.040 --> 47:15.520
These aren't collector's items
we're talking about.

47:15.720 --> 47:19.088
These are tools used by very sick people
to imprison my son.

47:20.440 --> 47:21.566
Right.

47:22.200 --> 47:23.804
Of course. I'm sorry. I just...

47:25.240 --> 47:27.720
I just wanted to help him
with this movie of his.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.086
He's making a movie?

47:29.560 --> 47:31.562
What else you got here? (GASPS)

47:32.400 --> 47:35.210
Brizzle Wizzle, what?

47:35.640 --> 47:40.771
He's one of the most powerful Wizzles,
except for when he works with Tizzle!

Sorry.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.200
If we act fast, it should give us
enough power to blast all the way...

See when... If you press play,
it will move with the sound.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.880
- What do you think, gang?
- Isn't that amazing?

47:57.960 --> 48:00.280
- It's dangerous.
- Ah. Wow. Wow.

48:00.360 --> 48:03.887
That is really...
That's really something, huh?

48:04.040 --> 48:05.644
Yeah. Very interesting.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.211
We know what we have to do.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.320
But there's only one way
into the Forbidden Forest.

48:09.400 --> 48:10.480
I know this one. I know this one.

48:10.560 --> 48:12.847
"We must pass
through the core of the planet."

48:13.080 --> 48:16.360
But isn't that... That's where
the fire gods live, in the fire realm.

48:16.440 --> 48:19.364
Yes, but we must make peace
with the gods of fire.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.363
For the sake of both our worlds.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.130
Aah...

48:23.720 --> 48:26.007
So maybe we do the studies another time?

48:26.280 --> 48:28.601
And I'll head to my room
for the rest of the day.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.761
Are you hungry?
'Cause I can make you a sandwich

48:31.920 --> 48:34.240
and we can listen to some more Briggles Bear.

48:34.320 --> 48:36.360
Oh, wait. Why don't we
take a look at the list?

48:36.440 --> 48:37.646
I mean, it's Saturday.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.206
No, thanks.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.880
Yeah, hold on, he's just in his room. (GASPS)

48:45.960 --> 48:47.928
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry. It's me, James.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.162
- Not a real bear.
- What is wrong with you?

48:51.360 --> 48:54.603
Well, I was abducted,
and I feel like that has something...

48:54.760 --> 48:55.921
No. I get it.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.080
Okay, this whole thing is weird enough

48:58.160 --> 49:00.320
without you trying
to hang out with people my age

49:00.400 --> 49:02.400
or embarrass me in front of my friends.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.801
Also, people are saying
you hooked up with Merideth.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.400
Okay, do not do that. You're old.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.964
Tell Mom you need your own phone.

49:11.480 --> 49:12.481
Okay.

49:13.320 --> 49:14.560
Talk.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.968
- What do you want me to say?
- Into the phone.

49:18.920 --> 49:19.921
Hello?

49:20.440 --> 49:22.807
James, we gotta talk about these tapes, dude!

49:22.960 --> 49:24.200
- It's Spencer.
- I know.

49:24.280 --> 49:26.400
All right, so first of all
in that last episode... Thanks, dude.

49:26.480 --> 49:29.560
When Brigsby's in that ice planet
right before the federation invades.

49:29.640 --> 49:31.210
Yeah, but that's when
Brigsby reveals the moon base.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.560
Yeah, but it's an old Brigsby
to, like, the future Brigsby.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.560
Yeah. "Hope is not yet lost!"

49:35.640 --> 49:38.325
That's what old Brigsby says to,
well, himself.

49:38.560 --> 49:39.561
It's a piece of art.

49:39.680 --> 49:41.887
It's like this whole TV show
made in a bedroom.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.486
And all the characters
he put into that one universe.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.090
Then at the end of the episode

49:46.200 --> 49:49.480
when Sun Snatcher melts the peace treaty
before it has time to take effect

49:49.560 --> 49:52.040
That's like really good storytelling, dude.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.881
You okay?

49:56.360 --> 49:59.648
Yeah... No. That's...
That was one of my favorite parts, too.

49:59.840 --> 50:03.040
Okay, so are you doing an original
or are you doing the same story?

50:03.120 --> 50:04.680
It's basically right where the show left off.

50:04.760 --> 50:08.440
Snatcher is more powerful than ever.
Galaxy is on the brink of destruction.

50:08.520 --> 50:12.491
The old alliances are broken, and
there's only one bear who can save it.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.445
Guess who?

50:15.560 --> 50:16.766
Brigsby.

50:17.920 --> 50:20.400
So like uh... What happens next?

50:20.480 --> 50:23.200
Okay, so first, Pla'torian raiders
come in on their lightships

50:23.280 --> 50:25.851
to Brigsby's cabin in the desert
where he's lived his whole life

50:25.960 --> 50:27.849
and they take his bear parents prisoner.

50:27.960 --> 50:32.409
Then they bring him to a world that
he never even knew existed.

50:32.560 --> 50:35.120
The Future Light Fortress. It is massive!

50:35.200 --> 50:36.960
And that's when it gets complicated.

50:37.040 --> 50:38.320
He got to escape the palace.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.920
He travels to Forever Mountain
gets the Sortis Crystal

50:41.000 --> 50:44.083
and then he finally,
finally finds the Smiles Sisters.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.680
And, for the first time ever,

50:45.760 --> 50:48.809
Brigsby defeats Sun Snatcher,
once and for all.

50:49.600 --> 50:53.002
And then maybe at some point he gets
his bear parents out of space jail.

50:53.160 --> 50:56.721
'Cause if you think about what they did,
it wasn't even that bad.

50:57.440 --> 51:01.923
Dude, this is insane. It's so good.
Bro, we could use my camera.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.726
We could start shooting
this thing right now. Like...

51:05.080 --> 51:07.160
Brigsby's the only one in that scene, right?

51:07.240 --> 51:09.129
- Yeah.
- We could shoot that shit tomorrow, dude.

51:09.280 --> 51:10.400
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

51:10.480 --> 51:13.440
I actually know a place that looks
just like that an hour and a half away.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.000
And if we just add
some green screen and some props.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.320
I mean, we've got some work, but it's doable.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.561
Brigsby, what's wrong?

51:19.680 --> 51:21.682
Wait, how did Brigsby get in there?

51:22.400 --> 51:25.483
Oh, yeah, so I uploaded some clips online.

51:25.600 --> 51:29.321
And I was going to send you the link
I know you don't got a VCR or whatever.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.405
And they've...

51:31.880 --> 51:34.167
There are couple hundred views already.
Tight.

51:35.960 --> 51:40.249
So now there are real people

51:40.800 --> 51:43.326
who are watching the show?

51:43.520 --> 51:45.966
Yeah, man. People are going to
want to see this shit, dude.

51:46.240 --> 51:48.242
It's pretty awesome if you ask me.

51:48.400 --> 51:51.324
We just got to figure out
the rest of that costume.

51:53.040 --> 51:57.967
And... And you...
And you really want to do this with me?

51:58.240 --> 52:01.369
Yeah, man. I mean, there's not
a lot of stuff like this out there.

52:01.480 --> 52:03.164
And I've never done a whole movie.

52:03.720 --> 52:04.881
So, why not?

52:05.440 --> 52:08.040
And I got a drug test coming up
in a couple weeks,

52:08.120 --> 52:11.010
so I've just been hanging around,
bored as shit all the time.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.766
Oh, and we got to do that
Brigsby theme song, right?

52:13.920 --> 52:14.921
Yes!

52:15.400 --> 52:19.291
(BOTH VOCALIZING TUNE)

52:22.480 --> 52:23.891
You're my friend.

52:30.880 --> 52:32.240
Wait, Spence. This is it.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.561
This is what we should use
for the third raid.

Arielle, the Shadow Galaxy
is more than 14 Neons away.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.967
I will miss all of you when you pass away,

52:48.120 --> 52:50.361
even though you brought this upon yourselves.

52:50.560 --> 52:53.882
You see, curiosity is an unnatural emotion.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.645
They're still attacking. Go!

52:57.280 --> 52:59.521
Arielle, the Goads aren't working.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.689
Fire away!

53:02.080 --> 53:04.048
That's good. Now, foot off the brake.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.242
Just drive, and we'll just get out of here.

53:06.760 --> 53:09.280
- I'm doing it!
- Hey, no, look forward.

53:09.360 --> 53:12.284
- I'm driving a car!
- He's driving a car!

Okay. Is that everything?

54:31.720 --> 54:34.041
Yep. This is everything I need
for my new garden.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.851
Hey, excuse me.

54:36.880 --> 54:38.769
- Are you the bear guy?
- Mmm-hmm.

54:39.200 --> 54:40.201
Holy shit!

54:40.760 --> 54:41.880
Oh, my God!

54:41.960 --> 54:44.531
I saw you, and you got the shirt on...

54:45.080 --> 54:47.400
Oh, it's Brigsby's art grid.

54:47.480 --> 54:48.800
That's right. The art grid.

54:48.880 --> 54:51.040
Wow. My friends and I love those videos, man.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.240
They're incredible.

54:52.320 --> 54:56.000
I know you didn't make them but
they were made for you by your freak dad.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.920
That's so messed up.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.560
Can I get a photo with you?

54:59.640 --> 55:01.680
- Do you mind?
- No. I could do a photo.

55:01.760 --> 55:04.081
- Hi, can you take a photo of us?
- Mmm? Oh, me? Yeah.

55:04.480 --> 55:06.130
- Is this your real mom?
- Yeah.

55:34.560 --> 55:36.520
JAMES: I guess the key thing
to think about here

55:36.600 --> 55:39.280
is that Feldo Mortese
is a powerful Bandith Warrior.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.440
But he's sad, right?

55:40.520 --> 55:42.240
Yes, exactly. He's sad.

55:42.320 --> 55:44.641
That's the whole reason
why he lives in the cave.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.960
Makes sense. Give it a shot?

55:47.040 --> 55:48.121
Let's do it!

55:48.240 --> 55:50.720
Your parents aren't coming home
any time soon, right?

Yeah. One's doing golf
and the other one's at the stores.

Just try to focus on your tragic past now
if you can.

you call Sun Snatcher.

Those who survived, fled.

56:13.520 --> 56:18.560
Leaving only me, cowering
in the dark corner of a forgotten world.

56:19.040 --> 56:22.200
You, Brigsby Bear,

56:22.280 --> 56:24.282
are the chosen one.

- Yeah.

bring it to another level.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.040
Really, another one?

56:47.120 --> 56:49.120
I don't know... I could try something.

56:49.200 --> 56:52.360
Okay, just don't break
any sacred codes of Bandith culture.

56:52.440 --> 56:54.240
Okay. I don't know what those are.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.800
It's a distinct set of laws
that the Bandith follow.

to kill Sun Snatcher.

- Now he can see.
- Exactly.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.760
Now he can transport inter-dimensionally

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.842
- From the beaches of Inra.
- Exactly.

Sure, what's up?

- Thanks.

- Yeah, you were wasted.
- Yeah.

because I know that we both really liked
touching each other's bodies

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.282
- and doing sex type stuff.
- Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, of course.

My parents are so messed up and sad.

Really? That's great.

I was so nervous. Thank you.

I was like, "Am I going to
have to get married to her?"

But I'm still also totally into doing
that other stuff we did, too.

listen to much music, huh?

No, no, I did.

But it was mostly just stuff by the Beatlers.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.520

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.010
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.646
I have you now, Bear.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.402
Snatcher simply can't be defeated, Brigsby!

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.409
Perhaps not, my friends.

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.126
And so, now, a choice...

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.402
Perish here together
and watch Snatcher enslave all worlds,

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:38.044
or fold every molecule of this dimension
into a singularity,

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.086
creating a whole new universe.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:45.485
One where the forces of light
can fight on together.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.446
A new beginning?

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.409
Arielle, the amulet, quick!

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.329
(PULSATING)

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:08.044
Goodbye, Arielle.

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.245
You, too, Nina.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.371
Until our next adventure!

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.281
(YELLS)

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:25.685
No!

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.161
(INAUDIBLE)

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.211
(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.807
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.120
There's magic and wonders
and mysteries in store

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.960
A hero whose mission is to learn and explore

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:09.720
He's daring and caring and oh so much more

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.247
It's Brigsby Bear!

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.280
He travels the skies and the stars
through the night

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:21.120
And battles Sun Snatcher
with all of his might

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.040
He's strong, never wrong,
'cause he always does right

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.885
It's Brigsby Bear!

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.560
Indeed, when trouble is just round the bend

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:36.320
He'll keep us so safe
'cause he's always our friend

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.920
The bear who is there
through the thickest and thin

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.527
It's Brigsby Bear!

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:50.689
It's Brigsby Bear, it's Brigsby Bear
It's Brigsby

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:58.164
It's Brigsby Bear, it's Brigsby Bear
It's Brigsby

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.840
So come along where fantasies come true

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.289
With the Smile Sisters,
there's nothing we can't do

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.600
There's magic and wonders
and mysteries in store

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.480
A hero whose mission is to learn and explore

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.160
He's daring and caring and oh so much more

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.528
It's Brigsby Bear!
