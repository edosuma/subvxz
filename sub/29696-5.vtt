who were in
the psychic blast zone

14:26.381 --> 14:28.381
still wake up in the middle
of the night, screaming.

14:28.464 --> 14:30.297
I sleep great.

14:31.839 --> 14:33.464
Cool.

14:35.631 --> 14:39.964
I see you joined the force
right after the White Night.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.756
Justice needed
to be applied.

14:42.839 --> 14:45.506
And once they let you
yahoos put masks on,

14:45.589 --> 14:48.881
you had an excuse to wrap your
entire head in Reflectatine.

14:48.964 --> 14:50.172
Implying what?

14:50.255 --> 14:52.923
Guaranteed protection
from psychic blasts.

14:53.005 --> 14:55.631
Ergo, you sleep great.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.005
-Market research.
-(Wade sighs)

15:00.089 --> 15:02.047
Is that your cover?

15:02.130 --> 15:03.881
So, you watch a bunch of idiots,
and they tell you

15:03.964 --> 15:05.756
what they hate about
the new flavor of Pringles,

15:05.839 --> 15:07.839
so no one knows you're
secretly Mirror Guy?

15:07.923 --> 15:10.547
I know you know
it's Looking Glass.

15:10.631 --> 15:14.089
But you can have
Mirror Guy if you want.

15:14.172 --> 15:15.631
Hmm?

15:16.631 --> 15:17.547
Okay.

15:17.631 --> 15:19.214
Thanks for coming by.

15:19.297 --> 15:21.089
That's it?

15:22.130 --> 15:24.005
That's it.

15:29.673 --> 15:30.923
Oh shit, wait.

15:31.005 --> 15:33.631
There was one other thing
I wanted to ask you about.

15:33.714 --> 15:35.631
Um, what pills?

15:36.464 --> 15:37.964
I'm sorry?

15:38.047 --> 15:40.089
Well, I bugged
the cactus on your desk,

15:40.172 --> 15:42.422
and Angela Abar-- Sorry.

15:42.506 --> 15:45.214
Sister Night was just
asking about some pills.

15:45.297 --> 15:46.923
You bugged my cactus?

15:47.005 --> 15:49.839
Well, don't take it personally.
I'm FBI, we bug shit.

15:50.923 --> 15:52.506
So...

15:56.005 --> 15:57.673
What pills?

15:58.964 --> 16:02.422
That's a personal issue
between Sister Night and me.

16:02.506 --> 16:06.923
It would be a violation
of her medical privacy
to divulge it.

16:10.297 --> 16:11.422
May I go?

16:11.506 --> 16:13.130
You surely may, Mirror Guy.

17:43.881 --> 17:46.047

What does that mean?

19:08.923 --> 19:10.464
It's not brain surgery.

19:10.547 --> 19:12.130
You just hit the big
button in the shelter,

19:12.214 --> 19:14.631
-and the goddamn
siren shuts off.
-Man: Of course, sir.

19:14.714 --> 19:16.339
I'm happy to schedule
a technician

19:16.422 --> 19:17.881
to provide
an in-home tutorial--

19:17.964 --> 19:19.506
I do not need a tutorial.

19:19.589 --> 19:22.547
I've conducted over
500 drills on this unit.

19:22.631 --> 19:24.839
It's your machine that's
malfunctioning, not me,

19:24.923 --> 19:26.756
so you need to replace it!

19:26.839 --> 19:29.714
Uh, sir, I'm sorry. How often
have you been running drills?

19:30.839 --> 19:32.214
As often as I deem necessary.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.756
Right. It's just,
the Alert Pro manual
recommends

19:34.839 --> 19:36.297
that you program
an EDI simulation

19:36.381 --> 19:38.255
no more than once
every six weeks.

19:38.339 --> 19:40.839
I don't give two brown turds
about the manual!

19:40.923 --> 19:42.964
-All right, sir.
-When can you get
me a new unit?

19:43.047 --> 19:44.839
We can ship one out to you
by next Thursday.

19:44.923 --> 19:47.005
No, no, no!
Uh-uh. No way!

19:47.089 --> 19:48.631
No good.
I'm gonna need it sooner.

19:48.714 --> 19:51.381
-Post haste, soon as you can.
-We can do an overnight rush,

19:51.464 --> 19:53.172
but that's gonna cost
as much as the unit itself.

19:53.255 --> 19:55.839
No problem. That's great.
Overnight, do that.

19:55.923 --> 19:57.339
-Yes, sir.
-And throw in another roll

19:57.422 --> 19:59.422

It tastes like... nothing.

21:07.297 --> 21:10.589
Okay. Could you be
a little more specific?

21:10.673 --> 21:13.172
-(beeping)

tastes like something.

Well, this doesn't.

like the way it crunches.

21:33.005 --> 21:34.964
-Our patented process...
-Wade: Hi.

21:35.047 --> 21:38.297
I'm here to see
Cynthia Tillman.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.756
Bennett. Sorry,
Cynthia Bennett.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.130
Howdy.

21:47.214 --> 21:49.214
Howdy yourself.

21:49.297 --> 21:52.255
Got some of your
mail at the house.

21:52.339 --> 21:53.631
Damn post office.

21:54.214 --> 21:56.589
Three times
I filled out that form.

21:59.339 --> 22:01.756
Naked eye, be honest.

22:01.839 --> 22:04.547
Do these dogs look
exactly the same to you?

22:06.255 --> 22:07.381
(puppy whines)

22:10.673 --> 22:12.964
That one's just
a little smaller.

22:13.047 --> 22:14.381
Shit.

22:15.339 --> 22:17.506
-(whines)
-You want her?

22:18.297 --> 22:20.547
What am I gonna do
with a dog?

22:20.631 --> 22:21.923

22:28.047 --> 22:30.756
-(dings)

22:34.381 --> 22:35.923
I see the hat is back.

22:36.005 --> 22:37.923
(door closes)

22:40.589 --> 22:42.798
Didn't have time
to comb my hair.

22:43.589 --> 22:45.881
It's okay to admit that
you're anxious, Wade.

22:45.964 --> 22:48.130
I'm fine.
Just a little squidfall.

22:48.214 --> 22:49.673
Happens all the time.

22:50.339 --> 22:52.714
I was talking about your
chief getting murdered.

22:54.089 --> 22:56.214
You want to tell me
about the pills?

23:00.547 --> 23:02.756
It's Nostalgia.

23:03.923 --> 23:05.506
Nostalgia?

23:06.798 --> 23:08.381
You sure?

23:08.464 --> 23:10.047
Yeah,
I'm sure.

23:10.464 --> 23:12.506
Also sure they
outlawed those

23:12.589 --> 23:14.172
'cause it turns out
putting memories

23:14.255 --> 23:16.464
into pill form
led to psychosis.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.798
So, I highly
recommend you tell

23:18.881 --> 23:20.673
your lady friend
not to take them.

23:22.214 --> 23:24.964
I never said I got
them from a lady.

23:28.089 --> 23:31.297
Did you get them
from a lady?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.339
You have your pick
of good women,

23:35.422 --> 23:37.005
so why do you keep getting
mixed up with the ones

23:37.089 --> 23:39.464
that are just gonna
kick you in the balls?

23:40.631 --> 23:43.631
I picked you.
You're a good woman.

23:43.714 --> 23:46.255
And for seven years,
I tried to convince you

23:46.339 --> 23:47.923
that I wasn't gonna run off
with your clothes

23:48.005 --> 23:50.130
and leave you naked
all by yourself.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.005
Uh-huh.

23:56.172 --> 23:59.005
Seven years of bad luck.

24:23.798 --> 24:27.297
Man:
My mom was in fucking
Brooklyn when it happened,

24:27.381 --> 24:29.714
so she caught
the psychic blast full-on.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.756
I mean, full-fucking-on.

24:34.214 --> 24:35.798
You know what it's like
to be raised by someone

24:35.881 --> 24:38.714
who's always just waiting
for the next big one?

24:39.339 --> 24:41.339
Squids, man.

24:42.005 --> 24:43.881
Fucking squids.

24:45.047 --> 24:46.964
I read an article.

24:47.047 --> 24:49.047
There's this thing...

24:50.214 --> 24:51.673
genetic trauma.

24:52.839 --> 24:56.089
Basically, if something really
bad happens to your parents,

24:56.172 --> 24:57.881
it gets locked into their DNA.

24:58.422 --> 25:00.673
So, when my mom got
hit by the blast,

25:00.756 --> 25:03.464
even though
I wasn't born until...

25:03.547 --> 25:06.214
10 years after 11/2,

25:07.339 --> 25:09.756
it's like I inherited her pain.

25:11.255 --> 25:12.923
(door opens)

25:18.756 --> 25:20.297
Friend of Nemo's?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.255
Welcome aboard.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.422
Man:
Anyway,

25:36.214 --> 25:39.255
I keep calling EDS,
but I always hang up.

25:39.339 --> 25:41.506
I don't want to end up
one of those fucking nutters

25:41.589 --> 25:44.255
with my head wrapped
in that magic tin foil.

25:46.047 --> 25:48.255
One day at a time, right?

25:50.798 --> 25:53.589
Just sometimes, it feels
like it's never gonna end.

25:56.547 --> 25:58.673
I was where you are.

25:59.756 --> 26:02.381
I thought about that
one-eyed fucker all the time

26:02.464 --> 26:04.756
and it terrified me,

26:04.839 --> 26:07.005
but I am no longer afraid.

26:09.130 --> 26:11.255
On 11/2,
the Soviet Union

26:11.339 --> 26:13.714
was on the verge
of annihilating us,

26:13.798 --> 26:17.255
and we were more than
prepared to return the favor.

26:17.631 --> 26:20.464
Then that enormous,
tentacled abomination

26:20.547 --> 26:23.255
teleported into New York.

26:25.255 --> 26:28.047
If it hadn't arrived
when it did,

26:28.130 --> 26:30.214
we would all be ash.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.839
It united us against
a common threat.

26:35.130 --> 26:37.339
Does it ever end?

26:37.422 --> 26:39.589
Of course it does,

26:39.673 --> 26:41.381
because we are all in a tunnel,

26:41.464 --> 26:44.130
and every tunnel ends.

26:45.297 --> 26:47.297
It ends with light.

26:48.255 --> 26:49.756
And if you trust me,

26:49.839 --> 26:53.339
I will do my best
to show you to it.

26:54.506 --> 26:56.005
Hands.

27:02.798 --> 27:06.005
All:
We know there are other
dimensions than this one,

27:06.089 --> 27:08.923
but this is the dimension
where we live,

27:09.005 --> 27:11.673
and we will not live in fear.

27:19.381 --> 27:21.547
(indistinct chattering)

27:37.923 --> 27:39.714
Wade:
Good night.

27:41.547 --> 27:42.881
Night.

27:43.589 --> 27:45.297
I don't know
if anybody told you,

27:45.381 --> 27:49.089
but we meet on Tuesdays, too.
Eight o'clock.

27:50.255 --> 27:51.881
Great.

27:58.631 --> 28:00.756
I don't believe you.

28:02.089 --> 28:03.422
Sorry?

28:03.506 --> 28:05.130
There's no light.

28:05.214 --> 28:07.589
You're still
in the tunnel.

28:09.839 --> 28:12.923
I bet you're just as
batshit as the rest of us.

28:14.089 --> 28:16.673
Bats do shit in tunnels.

28:16.756 --> 28:18.923
Sadly, there's no way
to settle that bet

28:19.005 --> 28:22.839
until we can assess your
trauma relative to mine.

28:23.381 --> 28:26.631
Maybe you can share
when you come back Tuesday.

28:27.547 --> 28:30.422
I'm not coming back Tuesday.

28:32.172 --> 28:34.798
Okay. Fair enough.

28:37.923 --> 28:39.297

29:00.130 --> 29:01.756
Of course they hated it.

29:01.839 --> 29:05.089
Can't call a cereal Smiley-O's
and not put sugar in it.

29:05.172 --> 29:08.381
All that sugar
causes tooth decay,

29:08.464 --> 29:11.214
-hyperactivity,
and the big C.
-Come on.

29:11.297 --> 29:14.089
We used to eat buckets of
sugar and we won Vietnam.

29:14.172 --> 29:17.547
Technically,
Dr. Manhattan won Vietnam,

29:17.631 --> 29:19.339
but I concede the point.

29:19.422 --> 29:21.881
So if all the kids say is
whether they like the cereal

29:21.964 --> 29:24.464
or hate it,
what do they need you for?

29:24.547 --> 29:27.047
Focus groups are rife
with bullshit.

29:27.130 --> 29:29.172
They need me to determine truth.

29:30.381 --> 29:31.964
You can tell
when people are lying?

29:32.047 --> 29:33.506
Indeed, I can.

29:34.005 --> 29:36.506
There's a skill
I could've used
two husbands ago.

29:37.130 --> 29:38.673
So, what do you do?

29:40.381 --> 29:42.172
I'm a waitress.

29:43.673 --> 29:45.506
Nah. Try again.

29:46.214 --> 29:47.756
Okay.

29:47.839 --> 29:49.214
I work in foreclosures.

29:49.297 --> 29:51.964
No, ma'am, you do not.

29:54.005 --> 29:56.464
I'm a radiologist.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.047
Indeed you are.

30:04.714 --> 30:07.714
So, now that
we've established

30:07.798 --> 30:10.839
our... respective occupations,

30:10.923 --> 30:13.798
should we settle
our bet?

30:13.881 --> 30:15.255
Our bet?

30:15.339 --> 30:17.881
As to our relative
batshitedness.

30:18.673 --> 30:21.214
Is that all you want
out of me, Wade?

30:21.297 --> 30:22.714
My squid story?

30:23.547 --> 30:25.339
No pressure, but yes.

30:25.673 --> 30:27.881
Well, it's fucking stupid.

30:29.381 --> 30:32.047
I mean, you were there on 11/2.

30:33.547 --> 30:37.255
-You're gonna be
mad when I say it.
-I promise I will not.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.297
Pale Horse.

30:43.673 --> 30:46.005
The movie.

30:46.089 --> 30:49.339
Pale Horse.
It came out in '92.

30:49.422 --> 30:51.839
Steven Spielberg?

30:51.923 --> 30:53.547
Won, like,
a gazillion Oscars?

30:53.631 --> 30:56.339
Right, right. Sure.
I haven't seen it.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.172
Well, I've seen it
a thousand times,

30:58.255 --> 30:59.798
at least that's when
I stopped counting.

30:59.881 --> 31:02.381
I know everything
about that movie.

31:02.464 --> 31:04.631
It's called Pale Horse  because
that's the name of the band

31:04.714 --> 31:08.089
that was playing
Madison Square Garden
when the squid hit.

31:09.089 --> 31:11.005
Anyway...

31:11.089 --> 31:14.714
there's this one scene with
this little girl in a red coat.

31:15.172 --> 31:18.589
The movie's black and white,
so the red really pops,
you know?

31:19.130 --> 31:20.422
Um...

31:20.506 --> 31:24.089
And the girl's stumbling
around Herald Square,

31:24.798 --> 31:27.005
walking under the tentacles,

31:27.089 --> 31:29.297
and through
all the dead bodies...

31:31.089 --> 31:33.631
and she's scared.

31:33.714 --> 31:36.005
And she's calling out
for her mom.

31:38.547 --> 31:40.798
That just really stuck
with me, you know?

31:42.214 --> 31:44.422
I mean, I know it's stupid.

31:45.005 --> 31:46.964
Being obsessed with a movie,

31:47.047 --> 31:49.798
but watching it just
makes me feel better.

31:51.631 --> 31:53.798
Face your fears thing.

31:56.422 --> 31:58.673
'Cause I'm scared
all the time, you know?

32:00.881 --> 32:02.464
I mean...

32:03.172 --> 32:05.255
There's a squidfall,

32:05.839 --> 32:08.923
and people just pull
their cars over
and turn their wipers on

32:09.005 --> 32:12.673
like aliens aren't falling
from the fucking sky?

32:14.339 --> 32:17.506
Why isn't everybody petrified?

32:20.464 --> 32:22.172
The only time
I'm not losing my mind

32:22.255 --> 32:24.839
is when I'm watching
that film or fucking.

32:27.047 --> 32:28.673
What?

32:29.589 --> 32:31.506
You know, fucking?

32:33.005 --> 32:35.130
(both laugh)

32:38.714 --> 32:40.673
And I'm drunk.

32:41.631 --> 32:44.047
I'm gonna call a friend
for a ride home.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.881
I can take you home.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.172
You are also drunk.

32:48.798 --> 32:49.756
Cute...

32:49.839 --> 32:51.214
but drunk.

32:51.297 --> 32:53.547
Maybe you should
call a friend, too.

32:56.798 --> 32:59.005
I don't have any friends.

33:07.339 --> 33:08.798
No thanks.

33:08.881 --> 33:11.047
I don't partake.

33:11.130 --> 33:13.089
It's just tobacco.

33:13.172 --> 33:16.381
A controlled substance
nonetheless.

33:17.547 --> 33:20.381
-Where'd you get it?
-Why, you gonna call the cops?

33:20.464 --> 33:24.047
Used my last quarter
calling the cab.

33:24.714 --> 33:26.881
It does smell awful good.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.923
Does it?

33:43.506 --> 33:45.422
You were right.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.422
I'm not out of the tunnel.

33:48.506 --> 33:50.714
At least we're in it together.

33:57.172 --> 33:58.589
There's my ride.

34:03.005 --> 34:04.756
See you Tuesday.

34:05.464 --> 34:07.714
See you Tuesday.

34:25.381 --> 34:26.756
Shit!

34:35.506 --> 34:37.547
Dispatch, this is Glass.

34:37.631 --> 34:40.714
Did we ever recover the truck
from the guy that shot Sutton?

34:40.798 --> 34:43.047
Man (over radio):
Please repeat that.

34:43.130 --> 34:45.297
The truck,
the lettuce truck,

34:45.381 --> 34:47.214
the goddamn Kavalry was driving.

34:47.297 --> 34:49.172
Did we ever recover it?

34:49.255 --> 34:51.589
That's a negative. Why?

34:51.673 --> 34:53.214
Call you back.

35:17.214 --> 35:20.297
Way to go, dummy.
You sure can pick 'em.

35:24.297 --> 35:26.714
Another kick in
the balls coming up.

35:34.255 --> 35:35.589
(sighs)

35:37.047 --> 35:38.881
Dispatch, this is Glass.

35:38.964 --> 35:42.214
I have positively
ID'd 7K suspects.

35:42.297 --> 35:43.422
Requesting backup.

35:43.506 --> 35:45.631
I'm at that abandoned
department store

35:45.714 --> 35:47.964
out on Rural Route 9,
do you copy?

35:48.047 --> 35:50.839
Dispatch: Copy that.
We're on our way.

35:56.589 --> 36:00.172
(clock ticking)

36:08.214 --> 36:10.381
(ticking continuing)

36:34.089 --> 36:36.798
(ticking continuing)

36:57.798 --> 36:59.964
(ticking continuing)

37:08.464 --> 37:10.464
(electricity zaps)

37:13.964 --> 37:16.172
Man: I heard it
come out over here!

37:20.964 --> 37:22.631
The church!

37:23.381 --> 37:26.089
Forty degrees south, southwest.

37:44.589 --> 37:47.714
(voices chattering)

37:48.839 --> 37:50.339
(electricity zaps)

37:55.130 --> 37:57.005
(zaps)

38:02.339 --> 38:05.339
-(zaps)
-(cocks gun)

38:06.673 --> 38:08.798
-Wade!
-Nobody move!

38:08.881 --> 38:10.798
Hey, he's here!

38:10.881 --> 38:13.089
Tulsa Police! Everybody,
down on the ground.

38:13.172 --> 38:15.339
You! Turn that
fucking thing off.

38:18.005 --> 38:20.047
Just be cool, okay?

38:20.422 --> 38:22.589
Are you opening portals?
Are you?!

38:22.673 --> 38:24.172
Let's just talk
about this.

38:24.255 --> 38:26.339
Answer me or I will shoot!

38:26.422 --> 38:27.964
What the hell is
going on here?!

38:28.047 --> 38:29.631
What's going on
here Wade is that

38:29.714 --> 38:32.047
I went to a lot of
trouble to bring you in.

38:32.130 --> 38:35.297
We even rigged the lettuce
to fall off the damn truck.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.798
But if you're just
gonna keep yelling,

38:36.881 --> 38:39.422
I'm not gonna be
able to tell you why.

38:39.964 --> 38:42.756
Can you lower
the gun, please?

38:43.881 --> 38:46.047
(gunfire echoes)

38:51.547 --> 38:54.255
Blanks, Wade.
Just to be safe.

38:57.047 --> 38:59.297
Oh, and that was us
on your walkie, too.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.047
We boosted your signal.

39:01.547 --> 39:03.005
What is this?

39:03.089 --> 39:07.214
This is the only way
to show you the truth, Wade.

39:57.297 --> 39:59.964
I really am a radiologist.

40:14.923 --> 40:16.297
Reflectatine, huh?

40:17.130 --> 40:18.589
You put that
in all your hats?

40:18.673 --> 40:20.172
(electricity zaps)

40:24.130 --> 40:27.464
Gotta protect the gray matter
from psychic blasts, man.

40:27.923 --> 40:30.172
I hear that stuff
does the trick.

40:31.673 --> 40:33.839
Is that why you made
your mask out of it?

40:34.798 --> 40:37.005
The one you wear to work?

40:38.214 --> 40:40.464
I know who you are,
Looking Glass.

40:41.506 --> 40:44.839
Are you even trying to disguise
your voice, Senator?

40:46.798 --> 40:49.214
Shit, am I still
wearing my mask?

40:49.297 --> 40:51.130
Sorry.

40:51.214 --> 40:53.255
That is just
incredibly rude.

40:53.339 --> 40:55.339
This is just
for them.

40:55.714 --> 40:58.422
-You're gonna kill me.
-What?

40:58.506 --> 41:01.839
Wade, buddy,
why would I kill you?

41:01.923 --> 41:03.839
You're a cop killer.

41:03.923 --> 41:05.673
Keene:
You mean the White Night?

41:05.756 --> 41:07.964
Come on.

41:08.047 --> 41:09.839
I'm not a murderer.

41:09.923 --> 41:11.422
I'm a politician.

41:12.089 --> 41:15.089
I came down here and assumed
leadership of these idiots

41:15.172 --> 41:17.714
to prevent that shit
from happening again.

41:17.798 --> 41:20.881
And my buddy Judd did
the same as chief of police.

41:21.756 --> 41:23.714
Each of us managing
our respective team

41:23.798 --> 41:26.339
so that we could
maintain the peace.

41:26.422 --> 41:28.214
That's not true.

41:28.714 --> 41:30.214
Is anything true, Wade?

41:30.297 --> 41:31.673
(zaps)

41:35.047 --> 41:36.673
Lord Jesus!

41:37.255 --> 41:40.005
But you don't really
care about any of this

41:40.089 --> 41:42.047
'cause all you really care
about is what you saw us

41:42.130 --> 41:44.506
throwing those
basketballs into.

41:44.589 --> 41:45.798
You know what it was?

41:45.881 --> 41:49.881
It was a CX-924
teleportation window.

41:50.589 --> 41:52.422
Just like the one they
were playing around with

41:52.506 --> 41:54.923
at the Institute
for Transdimensional Studies

41:55.005 --> 41:57.047
in Herald Square on 11/2.

41:57.130 --> 41:59.089
That is correct.

42:00.339 --> 42:02.714
You want to guess
what that bad boy is for?

42:03.881 --> 42:06.589
You're gonna open up
a portal in Tulsa.

42:08.297 --> 42:10.255
Drop another squid on us.

42:10.339 --> 42:11.839
Come on.

42:11.923 --> 42:14.631
Where's the originality
in that? No.

42:15.673 --> 42:17.756
No, we're gonna do
something new.

42:19.297 --> 42:20.923
Wade.

42:23.089 --> 42:25.255
I'm gonna show
you something,

42:26.047 --> 42:28.255
and after you see it,

42:28.339 --> 42:30.005
you're gonna walk out of here

42:30.089 --> 42:31.756
and you're never
gonna be afraid

42:31.839 --> 42:35.089
of big teleporting
aliens ever again.

42:36.089 --> 42:38.172
Because I'm gonna
set you free.

42:39.005 --> 42:40.381
In return,

42:40.464 --> 42:42.130
I'm gonna ask you
to do me a favor.

42:42.798 --> 42:44.964
Call it a squid pro quo.

42:46.339 --> 42:48.506
This Angela Abar?

42:49.964 --> 42:53.255
She either killed Judd Crawford
or she knows who did.

42:54.506 --> 42:56.214
Either way,
she threatens to disrupt

42:56.297 --> 42:58.464
the aforementioned peace.

42:59.005 --> 43:01.381
I know Agent Blake
already suspects her,

43:01.464 --> 43:04.297
so how about you
just help that along?

43:04.839 --> 43:06.798
Angela trusts you.

43:07.464 --> 43:09.255
Serve her up, and that way,

43:09.339 --> 43:12.214
I don't have to ask these
racist Okies to go to her house

43:12.297 --> 43:15.506
and kill her and her
entire fucking family.

43:16.089 --> 43:18.422
I just need to get her off
the board for a couple days

43:18.506 --> 43:20.798
while I wrap things up.

43:20.881 --> 43:22.798
Your call, Wade.

43:23.464 --> 43:25.631
Either way works for me.

43:28.214 --> 43:29.839
All right.

43:35.005 --> 43:37.756
Couple weeks after
I was elected senator

43:37.839 --> 43:39.673
of the great
state of Oklahoma,

43:39.756 --> 43:41.589
I was appointed to
the Appropriations Committee,

43:41.673 --> 43:43.631
which sucked because
I wanted something sexy,

43:43.714 --> 43:46.756
like Intelligence or Judiciary,
but you get what you get.

43:46.839 --> 43:48.756
You don't get upset,
so I accepted.

43:48.839 --> 43:51.798
In my very first day,
they brought me
into a little room,

43:51.881 --> 43:54.923
and they showed me
what I'm about to show you.

43:55.005 --> 43:57.756
Took me a couple years
to pirate a copy for myself.

44:03.297 --> 44:04.506
So, Wade,

44:04.589 --> 44:06.714
you can tell your cop buddies
I'm running the Kavalry

44:06.798 --> 44:09.172
and then I'll convince
them all you're crazy,

44:09.255 --> 44:12.339
which will not be difficult
given your secret shiny hats.

44:15.130 --> 44:17.255
Or you can press play,

44:18.339 --> 44:20.506
and finally be free.

44:23.547 --> 44:26.255
I leave it entirely
in your hands.

44:49.589 --> 44:51.381
(clicks)

44:52.589 --> 44:56.339
Hello, Robert.
Adrian Veidt here.

44:56.422 --> 44:59.673
Assuming my instructions have
been followed to the letter,

44:59.756 --> 45:03.339
today is January 21st, 1993,

45:03.422 --> 45:07.297
and you were just inaugurated.

45:07.381 --> 45:10.005
Allow me to be amongst
the very first to say

45:10.089 --> 45:13.756
congratulations,
President Redford.

45:15.047 --> 45:18.297
Sir, I am recording

45:18.381 --> 45:20.964
November 1st, 1985,

45:21.047 --> 45:24.089
seven years in your past.

45:24.172 --> 45:27.047
How could I predict that you
would be elected president

45:27.130 --> 45:29.839
with such incredible accuracy?

45:30.631 --> 45:33.130
Because I didn't predict it.

45:33.214 --> 45:34.631
I planned it.

45:36.047 --> 45:38.964
Here, in '85,

45:39.047 --> 45:41.464
the end is nigh.

45:41.547 --> 45:43.756
Nuclear holocaust
between the United States

45:43.839 --> 45:46.047
and Russia is imminent.

45:46.130 --> 45:48.422
Fortunately,
I planned for this, too.

45:48.506 --> 45:51.923
And the only way to stave
off mankind's extinction

45:52.005 --> 45:56.297
is with a weapon more powerful
than any atomic device.

45:56.381 --> 45:59.464
That weapon is fear,

45:59.547 --> 46:02.589
and I, Mr. President,

46:02.673 --> 46:04.297
am its architect.

46:05.214 --> 46:07.422
In 24 hours time,

46:07.506 --> 46:10.089
that's seven years ago for you,

46:10.172 --> 46:14.589
an extra-dimensional monster
will materialize in Manhattan,

46:14.673 --> 46:16.923
unleashing a psychic
blast that kills

46:17.005 --> 46:19.089
half the city's population,

46:19.172 --> 46:22.089
and traumatizes millions more.

46:22.172 --> 46:24.464
Yet the monster
will not have come

46:24.547 --> 46:27.005
from another dimension at all.

46:27.756 --> 46:29.964
It will have come from me.

46:31.214 --> 46:33.172
A hoax, Mr. President.

46:35.547 --> 46:39.255
An elaborate, meticulously
engineered hoax

46:39.339 --> 46:42.339
to save the world.

46:42.422 --> 46:44.798
Now, the hard part.
What's next.

46:44.881 --> 46:46.547
The transition won't
start immediately.

46:46.631 --> 46:48.798
The world will
need time to heal,

46:48.881 --> 46:52.130
and, of course, I'll have
to maintain the peace

46:52.214 --> 46:55.339
with additional small-scale
extra-dimensional events.

46:55.422 --> 46:58.255
But now, I am sure
as you watch this,

46:58.339 --> 47:01.214
mankind is ready for change.

47:01.881 --> 47:04.047
I envision a stronger,

47:04.130 --> 47:07.005
loving world committed
to caring for the weak,

47:07.089 --> 47:09.547
reversing environmental ruin,

47:09.631 --> 47:12.381
and cultivating true equality.

47:12.464 --> 47:14.798
I know you share these values.

47:14.881 --> 47:17.798
That's why I'll do all I can,

47:17.881 --> 47:19.964
and why I did all I could,

47:20.047 --> 47:21.839
to get you elected.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.130
But this will only work

47:24.214 --> 47:28.839
if you willingly become
my partner, Mr. President.

47:28.923 --> 47:32.631
My partner
in building a utopia.

47:33.923 --> 47:35.089
But first,

47:35.172 --> 47:37.547
I'll need to earn
your trust, and you,

47:37.631 --> 47:40.005
undoubtedly, have questions.

47:40.089 --> 47:43.422
If you'll indulge me
for the next few hours,

47:44.464 --> 47:47.422
I think I have
some answers. So,

47:47.506 --> 47:49.547
let's dive in, shall we?

47:59.089 --> 48:00.923
(air hissing)

48:01.464 --> 48:04.673
Chop-chop, everyone! Come on!
Time is of the essence!

48:04.756 --> 48:06.964
Where's the--
Oh, there we are.

48:09.381 --> 48:11.464
That's good. Yep.

48:11.547 --> 48:13.923
(air hissing)

48:29.673 --> 48:31.589
(muffled):
Ready, Mr. Philips?

48:31.673 --> 48:33.297
Safe travels, Master.

48:33.839 --> 48:36.422
Three, two,

48:36.881 --> 48:38.089
one!

48:40.464 --> 48:41.839

48:50.547 --> 48:52.673

50:38.005 --> 50:40.172

There you are.

50:46.756 --> 50:49.089

50:49.172 --> 50:51.589

Was I not clear in my letter?

51:27.798 --> 51:29.339
I warned you.

51:29.422 --> 51:32.964
Time and time
and time again.

51:33.047 --> 51:35.464
Yet you continue
to defy the laws

51:35.547 --> 51:38.047
of this land and those
of us who serve it.

51:38.130 --> 51:41.339

51:47.297 --> 51:50.130
And for that,
you must bare

52:04.214 --> 52:07.756
by the power vested in me
as warden of these lands,

52:07.839 --> 52:10.005
I place you under arrest.

52:10.798 --> 52:12.631
May God have mercy on your soul.

52:12.714 --> 52:14.547
God?

52:15.381 --> 52:17.923
Your God's abandoned you!

52:18.005 --> 52:20.714
Why wouldn't he?
You're pathetic!

52:22.172 --> 52:23.130
Every one of you!

52:23.214 --> 52:25.047
(clones exclaim)

52:26.214 --> 52:29.381
Alas, Master Veidt is correct.

52:29.881 --> 52:32.714
-(spits)
-Our God has left us,

52:32.798 --> 52:35.756
and it is unlikely he'll return.

52:38.381 --> 52:40.130
No mercy it is.

52:40.214 --> 52:41.839
(spritzes)

52:43.381 --> 52:45.214
Take a minute.

52:45.297 --> 52:48.255
Soak it in before
you say anything,

52:48.339 --> 52:50.381
-and just tell us...
-(spritzes)

52:50.464 --> 52:53.506
...in your own words
what Mercy smells like to you.
