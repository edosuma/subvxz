Please, no, no!

00:33.768 --> 00:36.869
No! Please! Please, God,
help me.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.039
Bubble, bubble...

00:41.008 --> 00:42.674
toil and trouble.

00:43.778 --> 00:48.247
- No... No. Please, let me go.
- No.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.530
What utter nonsense.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.821
No. No, no, no.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.702
Please!

00:58.726 --> 01:01.438
Please, I'll do anything!
I'll do anything! Please, help.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.774
No, no, no,
please help.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.375
No! No!

01:15.142 --> 01:16.453
My eyes!

01:20.614 --> 01:21.847
My eyes!

01:22.450 --> 01:23.649
My eyes.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.050
My eyes.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.765
Welcome, my darklings.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.089
My name's Morella...

01:30.825 --> 01:33.325
and this is...<i> Verotika.</i>

05:02.803 --> 05:04.703
<i>Oui.</i>

05:07.975 --> 05:09.141
That's it.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.179
Don't stop.

05:15.049 --> 05:16.782
Ah, that's it.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.455
Yeah, come up here.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.460
<i>Oui.</i>

05:29.863 --> 05:30.896
Hey.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.353
- Wait.
<i>- Oui.</i>

06:17.444 --> 06:18.655
Wait, no.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.911
Leave my shirt on.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.446
- Ah.
- Please.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.226
No.

06:24.318 --> 06:25.528
- Wait.
- Ah.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.696
No.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.031
Wait! No!

06:28.055 --> 06:29.055
Yes.

06:29.656 --> 06:30.656
Wait.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.561
- No!
<i>- Oui!</i>

06:38.165 --> 06:40.332
- Wait!
- What in the fuck?

06:42.703 --> 06:44.714
Your tits,
they're looking at me!

06:44.738 --> 06:45.971
Don't look.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.133
Wait!

07:03.157 --> 07:04.356
Come back!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.296
Not again.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.740
Hello?

07:21.542 --> 07:24.042
Francois, is that you?

07:29.650 --> 07:30.650
Dajette?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.965
Please, my <i> petite,</i> no cry.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.567
He's not worth it.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.391
Mariel, it happened again.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.695
And it was all going so well.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.444
Then he's an insensitive prick.

07:47.468 --> 07:48.468
Good riddance!

07:49.536 --> 07:51.381
I know, you are right,

07:51.405 --> 07:53.450
but he was so cute.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.452
They're all cute.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.853
You will make your eyes puffy

07:56.877 --> 07:58.643
for your photo shoot tomorrow.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.646
The shoot?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.080
I forgot!

08:05.419 --> 08:06.629
If you need anything,

08:06.653 --> 08:08.086
I'm right down the hall, honey.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.022
Goodnight.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.429
I will be just fine.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.031
Dajette...

09:27.034 --> 09:28.500
Only I...

09:29.069 --> 09:30.235
truly love you.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.737
Only I...

09:33.840 --> 09:35.707
know your pain.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.377
Sleep, my Dajette.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.814
For when you sleep,

09:43.517 --> 09:44.916
when you dream,

09:45.919 --> 09:47.664
it is then,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.155
only then that I am free...

09:50.924 --> 09:52.524
to roam.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.328
Sleep, Dajette.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.664
Let me be real,

10:00.067 --> 10:01.366
to do...

10:02.102 --> 10:04.836
as your subconscious wills.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.972
To do...

10:07.674 --> 10:09.741
as you wish.

10:11.545 --> 10:14.179
Set me free, Dajette.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.150
Let me be real.

10:34.735 --> 10:39.504
Milk or... beer.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.974
Dajette?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.210
Dajette, is that you?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.980
Hold on, Dajette.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.849
I'm coming.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.453
Dajette...

10:55.155 --> 10:56.788
she is but a dream.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.104
Stop. No!

11:01.128 --> 11:03.261
My sweet thing.

11:04.231 --> 11:09.045
I am your only reality.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.548
Stop, you... disgusting...
freak!

11:12.572 --> 11:15.140
Oh, I have only just begun,
<i>ma cherie.</i>

11:17.878 --> 11:20.957
"Freak" is such an ugly word.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.448
A true tramp... would use...

11:24.451 --> 11:26.351
grotesque.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.635
No? Do you not fear me?

11:32.659 --> 11:33.770
No!

12:03.523 --> 12:04.789
No!

12:10.697 --> 12:11.763
Mariel.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.250
No! No!

12:21.274 --> 12:23.308
Please, let it not be real.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.781
Not my Mariel.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.387
Mariel?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.129
Mariel?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.097
Please answer.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.837
Mariel!

12:54.040 --> 12:56.007
Oh, no, Mariel!

12:58.278 --> 13:00.578
Oh... no.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.348
Mariel.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.529
Killer.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.798
Killer.

13:21.701 --> 13:22.834
Your friend...

13:23.670 --> 13:25.370
She was a lot of fun.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.173
Killer. Killer.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.141
Oh, I am hurt.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.389
You...

13:33.413 --> 13:34.779
are a murderer.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.215
Yes...

13:36.817 --> 13:38.016
I am.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.051
I am...

13:40.754 --> 13:41.754
you.

13:42.556 --> 13:43.733
Me? No.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.623
I would never do such a thing.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.504
Yes and no.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.140
That is why I must do it...

13:51.164 --> 13:52.697
for you will not.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.977
No, no!

13:55.001 --> 13:56.879
It's not true.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.204
Leave me alone!

14:00.207 --> 14:02.385
I will leave you alone.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.409
Just sleep, Dajette.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.290
Then I will go.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.248
I will go do the things
that you envision in your mind.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.196
I will free

14:13.220 --> 14:16.566
what the erratic Dajette

14:16.590 --> 14:19.424
has found inside her soul.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.492
No!

14:22.362 --> 14:23.406
No!

14:23.430 --> 14:24.629
Yeah.

14:53.627 --> 14:56.327
Are you looking for some company
tonight,<i> monsieur?</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:20.690
<i>Monsieur!</i>

16:20.714 --> 16:22.447
You startled me,

16:23.183 --> 16:24.916
there, in the shadows.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.324
You like what you see?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.761
You want a date, yes?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.313
Yes.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.237
I do like,<i> mon amour,</i>

16:47.674 --> 16:51.442
but a date is not quite
what I had in mind.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.191
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>

16:55.215 --> 16:58.249
Well, then perhaps <i> monsieur</i>
would let me know his preference?

17:01.988 --> 17:04.355
I am sure
I can accommodate his tastes.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.538
Oh, I am sure you can, my <i> cher.</i>

17:09.561 --> 17:13.064
First, I wish to bend
you over right here...

17:14.099 --> 17:16.166
and fuck you in the ass.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.107
<i>Monsieur</i> has good eyes.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.109
Ass-fuck is my specialty.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.387
Then, I wish
to hear your neck...

17:37.257 --> 17:38.257
snap.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.528
<i>Monsieur</i> was only joking...

17:44.631 --> 17:45.797
yes?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.701
Wait, how many are you?

17:51.271 --> 17:52.748
Only joking?

17:52.772 --> 17:54.717
Why, yes.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.541
- Wait!
- I want to hear your neck...

17:57.677 --> 17:58.954
No!

17:58.978 --> 18:00.445
Break!

18:00.980 --> 18:02.280
No!

18:04.784 --> 18:06.884
Dajette, are you okay?

18:09.022 --> 18:10.733
I was asleep,

18:10.757 --> 18:12.023
- wasn't I?
- Yes.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.736
So?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.662
It was just a bad dream.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.767
Ah. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Over.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.736
Sexy. Sexy. Yes.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.951
Ah, great. Mmm-hmm.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.141
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.176
Mmm-hmm.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.225
That is... It's very nice. Yes.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.548
This is good.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.396
Huh... Move closer.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.165
And the two... Fierce.
Really fierce.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.489
Yeah.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.793
Yes, yes, yes. Very good.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.311
Now, sexy, sexy.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.701
Yes, yes.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.205
Yes.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.454
Ladies, ladies, can we...

19:05.478 --> 19:07.456
get on back to
the photo shoot, huh?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.791
And... And you, Dajette,

19:08.815 --> 19:11.093
can I get you in the...
In the scene this time?

19:11.117 --> 19:14.085
Hey, stupid, can't you see
she's not feeling well?

19:14.854 --> 19:16.499
I think she's still in shock.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.323
Yes, in that dream you found
your best friend dead.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.606
<i>This is just another</i>

19:23.630 --> 19:25.407
<i>in a series of grisly murders.</i>

19:25.431 --> 19:27.476
There,

19:27.500 --> 19:29.445
on the television.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.480
Their necks broken.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.048
With no leads to go on,

19:33.072 --> 19:35.117
police are still hoping.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.486
The police are calling
this murderer

19:37.510 --> 19:38.976
<i>le</i> neckbreaker.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.557
That happened because of me.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.071
I am to blame.

19:56.095 --> 19:59.542
No. How could you
be to blame, silly?

19:59.566 --> 20:01.911
You were with us all day.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.579
In fact, you were sleeping.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.870
That's how it happened.
I was sleeping.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.051
Girl, you are crazy.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.442
I think you have
finally lost it.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.611
Lay off.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.759
She had a bad dream.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.761
It is not a dream, you see.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.419
It is not. He lets loose
when I sleep.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.567
Okay, okay, okay.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.202
The shoot is now over.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.961
Someone here make sure that
she gets herself home safely.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.473
No.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.897
No one takes me home.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.433
I will be fine.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.280
No one can come with me.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.704
No one can.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.487
Okay, wow.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.590
What a psycho bitch.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.280
Well,
she's upset, poor thing.

20:51.384 --> 20:55.965
You know, you are so sensitive
and understanding.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.289
So, maybe you can
loan me some money?

21:01.527 --> 21:02.527
Fuck off.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.424
Got to stay awake.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.159
Got to.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.670
What is this film?

22:21.708 --> 22:24.675
It is only people making sex.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.042
So only make sex.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.781
How... wonderful.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.186
It's... happening.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.556
Mmm.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.759
I don't want...

23:15.128 --> 23:16.193
to sleep.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.206
Yes...

23:30.143 --> 23:31.208
that is it.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.244
Fall asleep.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.947
Set me free.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.995
This is where
she does them both.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.051
Oh, yeah.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.608
Are you sure she's asleep?

24:10.583 --> 24:11.682
Ah!

24:12.518 --> 24:14.163
She feels so good.

24:14.187 --> 24:15.453
<i>Fantastique.</i>

24:18.825 --> 24:20.090
I'm next, okay?

24:26.732 --> 24:27.843
Let me out!

24:27.867 --> 24:30.067
No, not yet.

24:32.839 --> 24:33.904
Don't wake up.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.984
It is too soon.

24:37.777 --> 24:38.777
No!

24:38.945 --> 24:40.711
Not yet!

24:43.382 --> 24:47.062
No, stop! No!

24:47.086 --> 24:48.118
No!

24:49.755 --> 24:50.921
Stop.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.591
No.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.098
Hey, you, come back.

25:04.470 --> 25:05.636
Shut up.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.180
How could I let this happen?

25:17.016 --> 25:19.094
Is the killer not me?

25:19.118 --> 25:20.317
Huh?

25:29.595 --> 25:31.106
Coffee.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.563
I need hot coffee.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.132
Then I can think.

26:06.632 --> 26:07.632
<i>Madame.</i>

26:08.134 --> 26:09.333
<i>Madame.</i>

26:09.902 --> 26:11.647
We are closing.

26:11.671 --> 26:12.903
Would you like another refill?

26:14.473 --> 26:15.473
<i>Madame?</i>

26:17.310 --> 26:18.310
Hello?

26:22.348 --> 26:23.348
<i>Pardon?</i>

26:23.983 --> 26:25.382
I was lost in thoughts.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.252
<i>Non.</i> I am leaving.

26:30.656 --> 26:33.235
Then I may suggest that one girl

26:33.259 --> 26:35.304
stay at home...

26:35.328 --> 26:38.162
for somewhere out there
is the neckbreaker.

26:43.736 --> 26:44.736
I will.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.271
<i>Merci.</i>

27:03.889 --> 27:05.456
<i>Le</i> neckbreaker.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.294
If they only knew.

27:14.567 --> 27:16.400
But then, how could they?

27:31.584 --> 27:34.218
And I know what must be done.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.623
I need something to drink.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.629
Something to wash it all down.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.179
<i>Allo?</i>

28:01.380 --> 28:02.224
Yes.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.881
I would like to report a murder.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.252
That is the correct address,
yes.

28:08.754 --> 28:09.754
Please hurry.

28:45.591 --> 28:48.303
You... You are here.

28:48.327 --> 28:52.107
Yes. You brought me back.

28:52.131 --> 28:55.644
And I was having so much fun.

28:55.668 --> 29:00.082
You know,
you may as well give yourself over to me.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.773
You will have to fall asleep
again, soon.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.876
You...

29:06.278 --> 29:07.678
You are...

29:08.414 --> 29:09.613
too...

29:10.049 --> 29:11.326
Too late.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.983
Too late?

29:13.352 --> 29:14.718
Too late?

29:15.454 --> 29:16.954
Sleep...

29:17.656 --> 29:18.922
for...

29:19.158 --> 29:20.902
forever.

29:20.926 --> 29:21.903
What have you done?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.438
You idiot!

29:23.462 --> 29:26.108
No, no, no,
this cannot be happening!

29:26.132 --> 29:28.098
Not now!

29:30.102 --> 29:31.680
Police.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.337
Hello, hello?

29:34.240 --> 29:35.939
Open up, now.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.416
Draw your weapons.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.186
And get ready.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.388
We are going in.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.327
Let's go.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.527
Don't move,<i> monsieur.</i>

30:18.551 --> 30:22.352
Take your hands off her neck
and move away, slowly.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.263
Hold it. That's enough.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.266
Whatever it is,

30:37.036 --> 30:38.368
it is not going anywhere.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.587
You bitch,

30:45.611 --> 30:47.022
wake up!

30:47.046 --> 30:48.812
I am dying!

30:49.381 --> 30:50.781
Wake up!

30:55.921 --> 30:57.387
The neckbreaker,

30:57.990 --> 31:01.203
he's as pale as a ghost.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.427
Looks like we found
our sex murderer.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.650
Sergeant, it is too late.

31:15.674 --> 31:16.674
She is dead.

31:17.743 --> 31:18.743
So young.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.155
So sad.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.023
<i>Oui.</i>

31:22.047 --> 31:24.348
But the freak did not kill her.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.962
It looks like an overdose.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.052
Hmm. So strange.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.466
Sergeant,

31:31.490 --> 31:34.124
her breasts are eyes.

31:36.862 --> 31:37.895
<i>Oui.</i>

31:58.217 --> 31:59.383
Well, there you go,

32:00.719 --> 32:02.352
the eyes have it.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.389
That's all fine and well...

32:07.092 --> 32:09.092
but what am I
supposed to do with these?

32:12.264 --> 32:13.697
Our next story.

32:43.762 --> 32:44.928
Hello?

32:48.100 --> 32:49.399
Who's there?

32:51.837 --> 32:53.136
What do you want?

33:03.849 --> 33:05.148
Your face...

33:06.752 --> 33:07.985
It's very nice.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.021
Give it to me.

33:12.524 --> 33:13.757
My face?

33:15.694 --> 33:17.327
What do you want with my face?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.798
Well, no, you can't have my...

33:23.369 --> 33:25.113
Well,

33:25.137 --> 33:26.937
if you aren't going to
give it to me,

33:28.674 --> 33:31.208
then I guess I'll just have to
take it from you.

33:31.543 --> 33:32.543
No.

33:34.713 --> 33:35.713
No!

33:43.222 --> 33:45.088
Now, look what you made me do.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.864
You should have just given it
to me when I asked.

36:09.902 --> 36:11.446
Hey.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.802
How are you doing tonight,
Murphy?

36:13.372 --> 36:14.282
I'm all right.

36:14.306 --> 36:15.539
You want a dance?

36:48.540 --> 36:50.385
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:50.409 --> 36:52.387
coming to the stage,

36:52.411 --> 36:56.891
get ready for the Mystery Girl.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.216
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:02.240 --> 39:06.409
the incomparable Mystery Girl.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.601
What have you got?

39:20.625 --> 39:22.503
What we've got
is grizzly, Sarge.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.105
Oh, yeah? How grizzly?

39:24.129 --> 39:25.340
Pretty grizzly.

39:25.364 --> 39:26.607
Face cut off,

39:26.631 --> 39:28.042
ear removed,

39:28.066 --> 39:29.966
no sign of any other
body trauma.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.548
The cause of death...

39:33.572 --> 39:35.416
Apparent shock
and loss of blood.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.219
Nice, another sicko killer.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.654
Anything else for me?

39:39.678 --> 39:42.557
Afraid not, sir,
I mean, we've got nothing.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.614
Zero evidence, which means
no leads or motive.

39:47.319 --> 39:48.495
Where's her face?

39:48.519 --> 39:49.697
Well,
that's what I was going to get to.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.921
Is, whoever did this,
just didn't...

39:52.557 --> 39:53.923
Just left with it.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.536
And left no...

39:55.560 --> 39:57.026
No trace. Nowhere to be found.

39:57.529 --> 39:58.673
No blood trail.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.729
Negatory.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.333
There's your motive.

40:03.135 --> 40:04.200
They wanted her face.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.064
Listen, man...

40:53.185 --> 40:54.651
Hello, again, my pretties.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.189
Did you miss me?

41:05.163 --> 41:07.130
How would you like
some more company?

41:12.804 --> 41:14.404
I thought so.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.941
Time to be with
the other sisters.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.108
Who is it?

42:14.132 --> 42:15.910
I'm in here.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.667
I didn't call maintenance today.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.704
What do you want?

42:22.674 --> 42:24.073
Hello, pretty.

42:24.809 --> 42:26.175
Collections.

42:26.845 --> 42:28.122
Collections?

42:28.146 --> 42:29.223
What do you mean "collections"?

42:29.247 --> 42:30.747
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

42:31.650 --> 42:32.715
Haven't you heard?

42:33.718 --> 42:35.018
I'm the face-collector.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.298
Face-collector?

42:37.322 --> 42:38.521
I've come...

42:39.524 --> 42:41.235
to get your face.

42:42.294 --> 42:44.294
My face? No.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.603
No! No!

42:55.874 --> 42:57.018
Pretty, pretty girl.

42:58.043 --> 43:01.055
With such a pretty face.

43:01.079 --> 43:04.025
You don't mind if I borrow it
for a while, do you?

43:04.049 --> 43:05.560
Borrow it?

43:05.584 --> 43:07.350
No. No!

43:37.148 --> 43:39.816
Aw, too late, pretty-pretty.

43:44.990 --> 43:46.022
But don't worry,

43:47.359 --> 43:49.292
you'll get it back
when I'm done with it.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.498
M-my face.

44:01.640 --> 44:03.206
My face.

45:04.169 --> 45:08.949
She's sexy, she's strange,
she's seductive.

45:08.973 --> 45:11.218
Ladies and gentlemen, this is,

45:11.242 --> 45:13.543
Mystery Girl.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.569
We got another one
just like the others.

46:47.272 --> 46:48.671
It's pretty gruesome.

46:49.607 --> 46:50.607
Brief me.

46:51.409 --> 46:53.888
Young woman, her face cut off.

46:53.912 --> 46:56.345
No apparent motive,
no witnesses, no leads.

46:57.182 --> 46:59.160
- No evidence.
- Okay, okay.

46:59.184 --> 47:00.616
I get the point.

47:02.086 --> 47:04.565
So, how many have we got now?

47:04.589 --> 47:06.022
This makes 13.

47:06.825 --> 47:08.202
All the same.

47:08.226 --> 47:09.570
I think it's pretty
safe to assume

47:09.594 --> 47:11.314
that these were all
done by the same killer.

47:11.696 --> 47:12.696
Ya think?

47:16.167 --> 47:18.479
We need answers, like, now.

47:18.503 --> 47:19.980
Wait until the press
gets a hold of this.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.904
Oh, that's the last
thing we need now.

47:23.942 --> 47:26.320
Make sure no important
information is leaked, okay?

47:26.344 --> 47:27.922
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

47:27.946 --> 47:29.178
I'm right on it.

47:35.587 --> 47:37.386
That skin mask

47:38.022 --> 47:39.422
that I wear...

47:40.425 --> 47:42.191
It fits so right.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.494
It makes me feel like I'm alive.

47:47.131 --> 47:49.799
Like I'm not the disfigured
freak that I am.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.874
Ah, my little pretties.

47:59.277 --> 48:01.844
You all look so lonely
hanging there.

48:03.448 --> 48:06.015
Waiting for me
to come home, I see.

48:08.219 --> 48:11.198
Did you miss Mommy?

48:11.222 --> 48:14.957
Well, there's gonna be an
addition to our little family,

48:15.994 --> 48:17.827
whether you all like it or not.

48:20.598 --> 48:23.210
Now, you be nice to her.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.701
There's more than enough room
for another.

48:27.906 --> 48:30.039
You'll get used to it,
my little darlings.

48:32.010 --> 48:34.310
This is gonna be a big...

48:35.046 --> 48:36.646
family.

48:49.527 --> 48:51.861
Well, looky here.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.308
- Hey, Sarge.
- What you got?

48:54.332 --> 48:57.411
Looks like a business card
from a titty club or a stripper.

48:57.435 --> 48:58.435
Check it out.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.340
Huh.

49:25.430 --> 49:28.309
LAPD, I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

49:28.333 --> 49:31.712
Um, okay. We haven't
done nothing, though.

49:31.736 --> 49:33.480
What about one of your dancers?

49:33.504 --> 49:35.716
Pretty sure
she's a feature here.

49:35.740 --> 49:37.406
Goes by the name
of Mystery Girl.

49:38.509 --> 49:41.121
We got a lot
of girls here, mister.

49:41.145 --> 49:42.489
I don't know all of them.

49:42.513 --> 49:45.292
The name
is Sergeant Anders, fuckface.

49:45.316 --> 49:49.051
Now, you're gonna tell me
whether she's here or not. You got it?

50:13.611 --> 50:14.955
Mystery Girl.

50:14.979 --> 50:16.746
Hey, over here.

50:21.819 --> 50:24.098
There's a cop out front
looking for you.

50:24.122 --> 50:26.022
He'll be down here any second.

50:27.525 --> 50:30.571
Stall him, cherie,
I'll make it very worth your while.

50:30.595 --> 50:32.539
You got it, girl.
I'll run interference.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.230
Now get. Hurry!

50:34.799 --> 50:35.799
Go!

50:53.584 --> 50:56.296
Where do you think you're going?
No people allowed.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.698
There's naked girls back there.

50:57.722 --> 50:58.899
Very funny.

50:58.923 --> 51:00.734
There are naked girls
out here, too.

51:00.758 --> 51:02.202
It's a strip club.

51:02.226 --> 51:04.426
Now, get out of the way
or I'm taking you downtown, too.

51:07.765 --> 51:08.931
Smart girl.

51:14.005 --> 51:15.704
Ready or not, Mystery Girl...

51:16.441 --> 51:18.107
Here I come.

51:22.780 --> 51:25.426
Hey, you jerk. You can't be
back here. Get out!

51:25.450 --> 51:27.261
Yeah, you asshole,
get the fuck out

51:27.285 --> 51:28.729
or we're gonna call a cop.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.064
I am a cop.

51:30.088 --> 51:31.921
Mystery Girl just
came through here.

51:32.356 --> 51:33.267
Where is she?

51:33.291 --> 51:34.668
What's it to you?

51:34.692 --> 51:37.137
Yeah, we're not
telling you dick.

51:37.161 --> 51:39.139
All you cops are the same.

51:39.163 --> 51:41.975
All bark,
when all you really want is some free sex.

51:41.999 --> 51:44.578
Wrong, I just want Mystery Girl.

51:44.602 --> 51:45.779
And you girls
better start talking

51:45.803 --> 51:47.381
if you know what's good for you.

51:47.405 --> 51:50.050
Why, what are you
gonna do, shoot us?

51:50.074 --> 51:52.419
Oh, believe me, right about
now, I'd really like to.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.288
But, no, I'm not
gonna shoot you.

51:54.312 --> 51:56.223
But if you don't
start cooperating,

51:56.247 --> 51:58.492
I can make your life
very complicated,

51:58.516 --> 51:59.993
if you understand me.

52:05.423 --> 52:06.967
Thanks, doll-face.

52:06.991 --> 52:08.791
At least one of you girls
has got some brains.

52:28.012 --> 52:29.712
I know you're in here,
Mystery Girl.

52:30.615 --> 52:32.326
Come on out,

52:32.350 --> 52:33.782
make this easier on both of us.

52:39.023 --> 52:40.701
Okay.

52:40.725 --> 52:42.685
Guess we're going to have to
do this the hard way.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.532
We know you're the face-ripper.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.102
We know you killed
all those women.

52:56.707 --> 52:58.607
We know you took their faces.

53:04.549 --> 53:08.217
Do you really think I'm dumb
enough to fall for that crap?

53:13.724 --> 53:17.237
And now I'll have your face
too, you stupid jerk.

53:19.530 --> 53:20.541
I will never give up.

53:29.607 --> 53:32.753
You cut my fucking face,
you sick goddamn cunt!

53:32.777 --> 53:35.222
Go ahead, run, Mystery Girl.

53:35.246 --> 53:36.690
How far do you think
you're going to get

53:36.714 --> 53:38.358
with a couple of rounds in you?

53:38.382 --> 53:39.860
I'm gonna get you.

53:39.884 --> 53:41.662
No matter where you go,

53:41.686 --> 53:43.397
no matter where you hide,

53:43.421 --> 53:45.566
I'm gonna get you,
you sick fuck!

53:45.590 --> 53:46.533
You hear?

53:46.557 --> 53:48.457
I'm gonna get you!

54:15.920 --> 54:18.365
All right now,
coming to the main stage,

54:18.389 --> 54:20.334
it's our new feature attraction.

54:20.358 --> 54:22.436
Put your hands together
for strange,

54:22.460 --> 54:25.372
alluring, Mysteria!

56:17.375 --> 56:19.608
That Mystery Girl
is a sly little bitch.

56:22.380 --> 56:23.946
Look at the mess she made.

56:34.091 --> 56:35.091
There.

56:36.360 --> 56:37.726
Good as new.

56:39.296 --> 56:42.564
Well, almost.

56:46.771 --> 56:49.338
And now, my darklings,
our next story.

59:16.554 --> 59:17.986
Contessa.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.604
You can get up.

59:24.628 --> 59:26.106
Is this your daughter?

59:26.130 --> 59:27.930
Yes, Contessa, yes.

59:28.699 --> 59:30.510
Come here, child.

59:30.534 --> 59:32.634
She is good girl. Untouched.

59:33.170 --> 59:34.536
I assure you.

59:35.739 --> 59:37.851
So she's a virgin?

59:37.875 --> 59:40.509
Yes, Contessa,
she's pure. Yes.

59:42.746 --> 59:44.313
And so she better be.

59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.874
Thank you, thank you, Contessa.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:02.631
Thank you, thank you.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:04.544
Mama!

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:06.580
It is fine. Go with them.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.281
They take you
to Contessa Castle.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:10.238
It will be your new home.

01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:11.541
Mama!

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.060
Another girl
for you to groom, Sheska.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.675
I leave her
in your capable hands.

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:39.201
Of course. As you wish,
my Contessa.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:49.811
Have you ever been
in a castle before?

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:57.619
Another peasant girl.

01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:59.888
Very well.

01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:02.969
My name is Sheska.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.893
You will obey me at all times.

01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:07.329
You understand?

01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:09.831
Yes?

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:17.117
Take her and get her cleaned up

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:20.008
and put her among
the other girls.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:39.294
Bow to your Contessa
when she enters the room.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:02.584
This one, Sheska.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.152
This one?

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:05.398
Yes.

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:07.033
Are you sure, Contessa?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.323
She's perfect.

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.427
Sheska?

01:02:46.563 --> 01:02:47.929
Come to me, Sheska.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.773
Has all been prepared?

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.175
Yes, my Contessa,

01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:02.410
all is as you wish.

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:05.347
Very well, then.

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:07.315
It is time.

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:19.267
Kneel to your Contessa.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.179
Come closer, my dear.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:25.944
Get rid of her.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:27.246
Now.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.903
Yes, Sheska.

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:19.921
Bring me my cloak.

01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:01.107
In my skin

01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.109
there is tingle, Sheska.

01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:05.266
Yes, Your Highness.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.014
Do I not look beautiful
and more youthful?

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:23.529
Yes, of course.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.967
You look much younger and
even more beautiful than before.

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:30.658
It's just the blood,
the blood of the virgins.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.754
Dispose of the body
in usual manner.

01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:09.669
And be discreet.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:12.238
As the villagers are
beginning to whisper things.

01:12:12.262 --> 01:12:14.929
And we best not give them
any more to whisper about.

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:23.671
As you wish, my Contessa.

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:00.141
Help me.

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:07.615
Help me. Please.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.099
Please.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:14.300
Please, help.

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:17.036
Help me. Please.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.459
So young.

01:13:19.329 --> 01:13:21.229
And you're so beautiful.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:24.110
Please. Please.

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:27.079
And your skin, it is like silk.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.181
Please.

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:30.238
Please, help.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:36.589
- Please, please, please.
- Please.

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.257
Please, no, please.

01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:41.360
Please, please, please. Please!

01:13:41.384 --> 01:13:43.362
Please, no.

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:44.386
Please, please.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.927
You smell it too,

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:36.450
don't you, my dear?

01:17:44.594 --> 01:17:47.028
Virgins taste sweet,
do they not?

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:57.071
We are alike, you and I.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:02.121
We like what we like,

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:05.346
and whether or not they understand,
it does not matter.

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:09.395
Now,

01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:11.018
my black beast,

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:13.688
bring me a girl.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.834
Bring her to me.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.658
Rip out her throat...

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:20.673
and let me suckle...

01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:21.829
her sweet...

01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:23.831
juice.

01:19:01.871 --> 01:19:03.270
Your youth

01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:06.073
is a precious gift,

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:08.075
my little doll.

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:11.779
It will keep me young.

01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:36.924
Sheska,

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:39.727
come take her away.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:43.041
Yes, my Contessa.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.065
Mmm.

01:22:33.215 --> 01:22:35.527
Stupid bitch.

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.151
She's going this way.

01:22:46.362 --> 01:22:48.006
No.

01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:49.396
No.

01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:02.710
Please, don't!

01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:06.258
No, please, don't take me back.

01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:07.614
Don't!

01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:11.518
Please, don't take me back.

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:39.380
Please, mercy.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:44.763
With this axe,

01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:47.821
I hereby seal your fate
and send you to the other realm.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.903
No, please, no.

01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:54.595
Well, this world no longer
holds a place for you.

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:58.143
Please, mercy.

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:00.112
I will drink your blood

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:02.870
and feed your headless body
to the flames.

01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:07.808
Proceed.

01:24:31.434 --> 01:24:33.100
And so, my pretty...

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:36.070
Nothing to say?

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:46.958
This is coming with me.

01:24:46.982 --> 01:24:50.484
And that, that you can send
to the pile with the others.

01:26:47.169 --> 01:26:49.281
Well, my darklings,

01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:51.038
after that one,
I need to take five.

01:26:52.007 --> 01:26:53.874
And what could be more relaxing

01:26:54.276 --> 01:26:55.487
than a nice,

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:56.888
long...

01:26:56.912 --> 01:26:57.912
bath?

01:27:01.984 --> 01:27:05.152
So, until next we meet,

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:06.721
stay dark.
