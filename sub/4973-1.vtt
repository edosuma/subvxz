01:38.371 --> 01:40.430
What was going on there, huh?

01:40.640 --> 01:42.540
We thought
you were sleeping, Daddy.

01:42.743 --> 01:46.008
How can I sleep with two
Twinkie burglars roaming around?

01:46.213 --> 01:48.078
<i>Can we watch
Dragon Tales, please?</i>

01:48.281 --> 01:50.875
Yeah. Why not, why not?

01:52.552 --> 01:54.417
Which one of these
turns on the TV?

02:09.568 --> 02:11.366
Honey, I think you
just opened the garage.

02:11.571 --> 02:13.368
I'm just planning ahead. I know.

02:14.975 --> 02:19.275
<i>- P-yew! Was that a stinky-dink bug?
- Good job.</i>

02:19.479 --> 02:21.242
Whatever happened
to the good old days...

02:21.448 --> 02:24.110
...when you pulled the knob
and on came the boob tube?

02:24.317 --> 02:26.979
The O'Doyles got
a universal remote control.

02:27.187 --> 02:29.246
One clicker controls everything.

02:29.456 --> 02:32.425
Makes life a lot easier
for old people like you.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.487
Well, whoop-de-do
for the O'Doyles.

02:35.695 --> 02:36.662
- Tree house?

02:36.863 --> 02:39.161
I don't know. Ask your father.

02:39.366 --> 02:40.628
Ask me what?

02:40.834 --> 02:44.565
Do you think you'll have time
to finish building the tree house ever?

02:44.771 --> 02:48.730
Yeah, Dad. It's kind of been
halfway done for two months now.

02:49.342 --> 02:54.177
All right. I want to, it's just I got a lot
of things going on at work right now.

02:54.381 --> 02:58.681
But as soon as I'm done, I'm on it.
I promise. Hang in there.

03:00.854 --> 03:04.346
Hey, look at Sundance
wrestle his duck.

03:05.158 --> 03:07.092
Oh, no, that's not wrestling.

03:07.294 --> 03:11.094
That's something you shouldn't
know about for another 10 to 30 years.

03:11.298 --> 03:13.528
Ten for you. Thirty for you.

03:16.937 --> 03:19.201
Hey, Michael? I'll see you tonight
at the swim meet?

03:19.406 --> 03:20.964
Swim meet.

03:22.042 --> 03:24.340
- I gotta go to that?
- Yes.

03:24.544 --> 03:28.674
- I'm kidding you. I'll be there. Okay?
- All right. I love you, Michael.

03:28.882 --> 03:31.009
Forever and ever, babe.

03:31.718 --> 03:32.980
Mr. Newman.

03:33.186 --> 03:35.211
Kevin O'Doyle.
Yeah. Always a pleasure.

03:35.422 --> 03:38.653
What kind of stereo you got
in that blue piece of shit?

03:38.859 --> 03:41.020
You know what?
I never checked, Kevin.

03:41.228 --> 03:43.662
Yeah, well, my father's stereo
is a Bose.

03:43.864 --> 03:46.662
Your father's stereo blows?
That's too bad.

03:46.867 --> 03:50.394
No! I said... That's not what I said!

03:50.604 --> 03:53.801
His father's stereo blows!

03:57.110 --> 03:59.738
Come on! Pay the man, let's go!

04:06.086 --> 04:08.145
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Good morning.

04:08.355 --> 04:09.788
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Hello.

04:09.990 --> 04:12.083
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Hi.

04:13.093 --> 04:14.924
Good morning, Mr. Newman.

04:15.128 --> 04:16.789
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Man, Alice...

04:16.997 --> 04:20.194
...I was stuck in traffic for an hour
and a half. When's the meeting?

04:21.401 --> 04:23.528
- It started already.
- What?

04:24.304 --> 04:25.566
Can I go to the bathroom?

04:25.772 --> 04:28.366
Go to the bathroom.
I told you, you don't have to ask me.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.640
Well, the interesting thing,
Prince Habeeboo...

04:37.851 --> 04:40.684
...is that the building codes
in Manhattan will allow us...

04:40.887 --> 04:42.878
- Michael.
- Sorry I'm late, sir.

04:43.089 --> 04:46.217
Some moron in a red Lamborghini
parked in my spot so...

04:46.426 --> 04:49.623
Prince Habeeboo
drive red Lamborghini.

04:50.497 --> 04:53.261
Red Lamborghini?
I meant blue Ferrari.

04:53.967 --> 04:56.231
Is this one of your partners?

04:56.436 --> 04:58.461
Actually, Michael
is just an associate.

04:58.672 --> 05:00.970
But he is one of our brightest
young architects.

05:01.174 --> 05:02.141
Thank you.

05:02.342 --> 05:04.367
Walk His Majesty
through our design concept.

05:04.577 --> 05:06.272
With pleasure.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.605
- Prince Haboobee...
- Habeeboo!

05:10.283 --> 05:12.308
Prince Habeeboo.

05:12.519 --> 05:15.010
Habeeboo. I thought I said that.

05:15.221 --> 05:17.883
When Mr. Ammer explained to me
the type of man you are...

05:18.091 --> 05:21.925
...a visionary who prides himself
on originality...

05:22.128 --> 05:26.929
...I said to myself, "Let's smash
the mold and redefine elegance."

05:27.133 --> 05:29.397
So I present to you your restaurant.

05:29.602 --> 05:31.092
Where is... Where's bar?

05:31.304 --> 05:34.967
Bar is... Here's the bar.
Now, the waterfall...

05:35.175 --> 05:36.233
Make bar longer.

05:37.677 --> 05:41.408
Okay. We could cut
into the atrium a little bit.

05:41.614 --> 05:46.142
No atrium. Just make bar longer
for Prince Habeeboo.

05:46.353 --> 05:47.320
Really?

05:49.489 --> 05:51.616
- Still itchy?
- You got it.

05:52.926 --> 05:56.191
And put big drain in floor
for wet T-shirt contest.

05:56.396 --> 05:57.920
Now, you're kidding me, right?

05:58.131 --> 06:00.156
Boob water's gotta
go someplace, Michael.

06:00.367 --> 06:03.734
Let's just take out the atrium and
run with that and there's your drain.

06:03.937 --> 06:07.429
- God.
- I love it. It is simply awesome.

06:08.008 --> 06:12.968
Yeah. Basically you want me to design
you an Arabian hoochie house?

06:13.179 --> 06:15.647
How dare you compare
Prince Habeeboo's Bikini Hut...

06:15.849 --> 06:17.783
...to this hoochie house?
- This idea's...

06:17.984 --> 06:20.350
...got nothing to do
with hoochies, Michael.

06:20.553 --> 06:22.043
It's like opposite of hoochie.

06:22.255 --> 06:24.052
No disrespect,
Prince Hubbida Hubbida.

06:24.257 --> 06:25.986
- Hubba Bubba.
- Habeeboo!

06:26.192 --> 06:29.286
Habeeboo!
Hubba Bubba is chewing gum.

06:29.496 --> 06:30.929
Prince Habeeboo's
not chewing gum.

06:31.131 --> 06:35.693
Prince Habeeboo, we will...
I will make this happen.

06:37.470 --> 06:38.437
John Ammer's office.

06:38.638 --> 06:41.607
I hope that atrium idea didn't take
too long to configure, Michael.

06:41.808 --> 06:44.572
Oh, there'll be other Junes
in my life, sir.

06:44.778 --> 06:49.340
See that parking garage
over there on 56?

06:49.649 --> 06:53.915
Watsuhita wants to knock it down
and build a luxury hotel.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.644
- You got the commission?
- Not yet.

06:55.855 --> 07:00.918
I just need someone to come up
with a design proposal. Intrigued?

07:02.829 --> 07:04.023
Hell, yes.

07:04.230 --> 07:07.358
I'm Fourth of July-ing with the kids.
When I get back, I'm all over it.

07:07.567 --> 07:11.936
Great. Have a great Fourth of July
with the kids. I'll put Swardson on it.

07:12.138 --> 07:15.938
No, no. Absolutely not.
L... l... Can't it just wait three days?

07:16.142 --> 07:18.940
These guys are Japanese.
They can't wait for their fish to cook.

07:21.514 --> 07:23.675
I guess I could talk to my wife.

07:23.883 --> 07:26.545
Great. See you later at happy hour
with Prince Habadabee.

07:27.220 --> 07:31.054
My son has a swim meet tonight
that I have to get to s...

07:31.257 --> 07:33.020
I'm just messing with you.
We're good.

07:38.231 --> 07:40.699
Yeah, Ben!

07:48.975 --> 07:53.571
That's my boy! That's my boy!
Kid, you were great!

07:54.013 --> 07:55.537
You're not my dad.

07:56.483 --> 07:59.145
- As far as you know.
- What?

08:00.520 --> 08:02.385
I was just joking.

08:02.589 --> 08:05.649
Is he really my dad?

08:05.859 --> 08:09.192
Come on, come on! Yes, Ben.
Yes, you did it!

08:09.395 --> 08:10.589
Honey, you were so great.

08:10.797 --> 08:14.255
Whoa, what are you, half a dolphin
or something? That was incredible.

08:14.467 --> 08:16.230
You just got here, Dad. I saw you.

08:17.337 --> 08:19.828
What do you mean I just got here?
Why are you saying that?

08:20.039 --> 08:22.007
I saw you. You jumped in there,
you swam here.

08:22.208 --> 08:25.803
- Then what stroke was he doing, Dad?
- He was doing the shut-up.

08:27.280 --> 08:30.681
Hey. Good thing is,
Daddy was here to see you finish.

08:30.884 --> 08:31.908
He didn't see me finish.

08:32.118 --> 08:34.347
He was hanging out
with Ping Woo for some reason.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.988
- Yeah, what was that about, huh?
- The kid was drowning.

08:37.190 --> 08:38.316
I'm gonna let him drown?

08:39.192 --> 08:40.818
Nobody goes drowning in my pool.

08:41.027 --> 08:43.587
How you doing? Bill Herlihy.
Ben's coach. You must be Dad.

08:43.796 --> 08:46.458
Michael Speedo...
Michael Newman. Sorry.

08:46.966 --> 08:49.628
Big Ben, that was great progress
out there, huh?

08:49.836 --> 08:52.669
Just remember, right arm out,
head turns left. Left arm out...

08:52.872 --> 08:55.500
Head turns right. I know.
I just forgot at the end.

08:55.708 --> 08:56.732
Well, that's all right.

08:56.943 --> 09:00.242
You master that, people are gonna
think you're a half a dolphin out there.

09:00.446 --> 09:02.505
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:03.383 --> 09:04.782
Cute.

09:05.451 --> 09:07.612
Hello? Mr. Ammer.

09:15.728 --> 09:18.492
Ben, honey, slow down.
It's not a race.

09:18.698 --> 09:20.393
That's his second one
in five minutes.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.295
Keeps eating more and more.

09:22.502 --> 09:25.403
He's like a machine.
He can't still be hungry.

09:25.605 --> 09:29.097
He's not. He's just doing whatever
Michael's doing. It's driving me crazy.

09:29.309 --> 09:32.972
Everything Michael's been doing lately
is very unhealthy for him.

09:33.179 --> 09:35.545
He's gonna kill himself.

09:36.316 --> 09:38.910
Like a signature building
we're talking about.

09:39.118 --> 09:40.517
Oh, my God.

09:42.355 --> 09:43.913
Scared the crap out of me.

09:44.524 --> 09:46.890
Dad, how much longer
are you gonna live?

09:47.894 --> 09:50.488
- One minute.
- One minute?

09:50.697 --> 09:52.790
- Daddy's gonna die in one minute!
- Oh, no, honey.

09:52.999 --> 09:54.364
Don't worry. I'm not dying.

09:54.567 --> 09:58.435
I'm gonna live for 200 years.
Is that long enough for you and me?

09:59.005 --> 10:02.736
- Promise?
- I promise. Swear. Come here.

10:04.077 --> 10:05.704
You son of a bitch!

10:05.912 --> 10:08.676
Hey! There are families here!

10:08.881 --> 10:11.213
Show some respect,
you pieces of shit!

10:11.951 --> 10:14.715
Go home and watch VH1, old man.

10:14.921 --> 10:17.754
Don't light another damn one!

10:19.058 --> 10:21.583
Benjamin. Benjamin.
What am I holding?

10:21.794 --> 10:24.592
A quarter. Now, Grandma
does not let me eat ice cream...

10:24.797 --> 10:26.389
...because of my diabetes.
- True.

10:26.599 --> 10:30.262
But she says nothing, however,
about a tasty quarter.

10:30.703 --> 10:31.965
Okay.

10:34.173 --> 10:35.765
All right. All right.

10:35.975 --> 10:39.706
Very quickly, please, count to three
because it tastes terrible.

10:39.912 --> 10:43.245
One, two, three.

10:44.884 --> 10:46.511
Are you shitting me?

10:46.719 --> 10:49.483
First he's eating like his father,
now you're talking like him?

10:49.689 --> 10:52.055
- Ben.
- Don't you ever say that again.

10:52.258 --> 10:55.591
- Sorry, Grandma.
- How do you do that, Grandpa?

10:55.962 --> 10:58.658
A good magician
never reveals his secrets.

10:58.865 --> 11:01.459
Your daddy has wanted to know
how I've done that trick...

11:01.668 --> 11:02.794
...since he was your age.

11:03.002 --> 11:04.401
Isn't that true, son?

11:04.604 --> 11:06.936
Hey, Michael.
Michael, who are you talking to?

11:07.140 --> 11:10.132
Jesus. I'm talking to my boss, Ma.
Take it easy.

11:10.343 --> 11:12.004
Oh, yeah?
Well, tell him to get a life.

11:12.211 --> 11:14.441
You got family here.
You're busy. Come on.

11:14.647 --> 11:15.978
My mother says hello.

11:16.182 --> 11:18.412
Oh, he's such a big boy, isn't he?

11:18.618 --> 11:21.951
On his big cell phone. Big boy.

11:22.155 --> 11:27.491
That's it. Get some sleep. Thank you,
Mr. Ammer. All right. Good night.

11:27.694 --> 11:30.128
- Are you done? Can we relax now?
- Sorry.

11:31.764 --> 11:34.198
Eat me, grandpa!

11:34.634 --> 11:35.692
You're dead.

11:36.369 --> 11:39.634
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah, you better run!

11:39.839 --> 11:41.636
I kicked your father's ass
in high school!

11:41.841 --> 11:43.172
Now I'm gonna kick yours!

11:43.376 --> 11:46.106
I hate that man.

11:46.412 --> 11:48.539
Okay, good night, you two cowboys.

11:48.748 --> 11:51.239
- Reach for the sky, Pocahontas.
- No, back to bed.

11:51.451 --> 11:55.046
Come on. Pocahontas is off duty.
I'm out of here.

11:58.024 --> 12:00.219
You getting sick, sheriff?

12:00.660 --> 12:02.719
I don't got time to be sick, so no.

12:02.929 --> 12:05.796
I need to watch this documentary
on Asian architecture.

12:05.998 --> 12:08.728
Well, you gotta get some rest
sometime, sweetheart.

12:08.935 --> 12:11.199
Besides, the woodland creatures
will laugh at you...

12:11.404 --> 12:13.998
...if you collapse trying
to put up the tent this weekend.

12:15.108 --> 12:18.635
Yeah. I forgot to tell you.

12:19.078 --> 12:21.171
We gotta postpone
the camping trip.

12:21.881 --> 12:23.746
Ammer put me on a project.

12:23.950 --> 12:26.350
It's due Tuesday. If I don't finish,
I'm off it, so...

12:26.552 --> 12:28.713
The kids have been talking
about camping all year.

12:28.921 --> 12:30.013
Think I don't know that?

12:30.223 --> 12:32.487
It's just every choice I make,
everything I do...

12:32.692 --> 12:34.592
...I disappoint somebody.

12:34.794 --> 12:37.388
Make sure you don't keep
disappointing the wrong people.

12:37.597 --> 12:40.122
I'm not out drinking or gambling
or hitting on chicks.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.097
I'm working my ass off
so my family can have a better life...

12:43.302 --> 12:45.065
...than I dreamed of
when I was a kid.

12:45.605 --> 12:49.200
The only way for that to happen
is for me to watch this stinking show!

12:49.409 --> 12:51.240
So relax, hon.

12:54.781 --> 12:56.271
Are you kidding me?

12:56.482 --> 12:59.508
Will you give me a break one time?

12:59.986 --> 13:03.547
Damn it! The O'Doyles got
a stinking universal remote control.

13:03.756 --> 13:05.587
We're gonna have one too.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.555
I'm sick of this.

13:12.165 --> 13:14.633
You want me to open
the garage for you?

13:27.613 --> 13:28.580
Closed.

13:31.317 --> 13:32.284
Closed.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.087
Open.

13:35.288 --> 13:37.620
Bed Bath & Beyond it is.

13:42.995 --> 13:44.622
Hey, man?

13:44.831 --> 13:47.766
You guys got any universal
remote controls in there?

13:47.967 --> 13:50.834
- For a shower curtain or a bathmat?
- For a television.

13:51.671 --> 13:53.969
I don't think so.
Maybe for a blanket?

13:54.173 --> 13:55.765
You got a remote for a blanket?

13:56.509 --> 13:58.943
Sorry, I don't work here.
I'm waiting for my friends.

13:59.145 --> 14:00.510
You're kidding me.

14:00.713 --> 14:03.739
Actually, yes. I don't have any friends.
Will you be my friend?

14:07.887 --> 14:09.514
Wow, man.

14:12.492 --> 14:15.256
Bed. Bed.

14:15.461 --> 14:18.225
Bath. Bath.

14:18.431 --> 14:20.126
Bed.

14:22.301 --> 14:24.963
So tired of my life.

14:30.676 --> 14:31.870
Beyond?

15:08.915 --> 15:10.746
Sorry to sneak up on you. I just...

15:10.950 --> 15:13.248
You guys got a universal
remote control back here?

15:15.621 --> 15:18.886
Something stinks
like stale french fries.

15:20.259 --> 15:22.227
All right, that's probably me.

15:22.428 --> 15:25.226
You know, fast food
shortens your life.

15:25.431 --> 15:26.659
Yeah, that's what I heard.

15:26.866 --> 15:30.029
But the way my life's been going
lately, that ain't such a bad thing.

15:30.236 --> 15:32.397
You're looking
for a universal remote control?

15:32.605 --> 15:35.039
Yeah. Just one device
to do it all for me...

15:35.241 --> 15:39.371
...make my life a little easier,
quicker, not so damn complicated.

15:39.579 --> 15:43.015
I'm not supposed to do this,
but you seem like a good guy.

15:43.215 --> 15:44.842
Hey. Somebody noticed. Thank you.

15:45.051 --> 15:47.110
I'm gonna show you a remote
we just got in...

15:47.320 --> 15:49.880
...that's probably the most advanced
piece of technology...

15:50.089 --> 15:51.181
...we have in this place.

15:51.557 --> 15:54.287
- Sounds sweet.
- It is sweet.

15:54.493 --> 15:59.123
The latest, greatest universal remote
not even on the market yet.

15:59.332 --> 16:04.065
I guess the O'Doyles' remote can bite
my advanced-technological ass then.

16:04.270 --> 16:06.761
I don't know the O'Doyles...

16:07.974 --> 16:09.635
...but they can bite it hard.

16:09.842 --> 16:11.207
Yeah.

16:11.410 --> 16:12.809
Come in the back with me.

16:13.312 --> 16:14.836
Okay.

16:15.815 --> 16:18.045
This is... This is very nice of you.

16:18.517 --> 16:21.384
- What's your name, anyways?
- Call me Morty.

16:21.587 --> 16:22.884
Morty, I'm Michael Newman.

16:23.289 --> 16:25.348
Michael Newman.

16:27.193 --> 16:29.093
I'm about to rock your world.

16:29.528 --> 16:30.722
Okay.

16:40.072 --> 16:43.872
I gotta be honest with you. This place
looks bigger from the outside.

16:44.076 --> 16:45.839
Just kidding.

16:47.246 --> 16:48.611
Hey, hey.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.530
I think maybe there in the middle?

17:22.647 --> 17:24.616
Sneaky.

17:29.889 --> 17:32.119
Where's the box?
Does it come with directions?

17:32.324 --> 17:33.848
Not necessary.

17:34.060 --> 17:37.621
Just point, click.

17:37.830 --> 17:39.957
Eventually, it will program itself.

17:42.868 --> 17:43.857
How much is this thing?

17:44.070 --> 17:46.561
Because I ain't exactly
Thurston Howell, you know?

17:46.772 --> 17:50.071
Lucky for you, it's not
in the bar-code system yet.

17:50.276 --> 17:53.541
So I'm gonna have
to just give it to you.

17:53.746 --> 17:56.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's the catch here, man?

17:56.382 --> 17:59.818
Want me to take my shirt off for you?
Because I don't play for that team.

18:00.019 --> 18:02.715
Hey. Man, get out of here.

18:03.556 --> 18:04.887
Why are you doing this, then?

18:05.091 --> 18:08.822
Because good guys need a break
every once in a while.

18:09.829 --> 18:11.023
Take it.

18:11.864 --> 18:12.831
Enjoy.

18:15.768 --> 18:16.996
All right.

18:17.203 --> 18:19.501
Only one thing
you need to know, Michael.

18:19.705 --> 18:22.367
This item is nonreturnable.

18:22.575 --> 18:26.102
Why would I wanna return something
I got for free?

18:47.500 --> 18:50.367
Twinkie. You don't need it.
You don't need it, man.

18:50.569 --> 18:53.868
You do need a Yodel, though.
Okay. Good job.

18:54.373 --> 18:56.898
Let's see what you got, mate.

19:04.350 --> 19:08.616
Look at me, turning my own TV on.
I'm a freaking whiz kid.

19:09.755 --> 19:11.655
<i>- Residential architecture...</i>

19:11.857 --> 19:13.722
- So I talked to the kids.
- Oh, yeah?

19:13.926 --> 19:16.759
They're very understanding about
not going camping this weekend.

19:16.962 --> 19:19.726
- Great.
- They could have a sleepover instead.

19:19.932 --> 19:22.196
That's a great idea.
Thank you, thank you.

19:22.401 --> 19:25.029
Thanks for being
so cool about this too.

19:25.237 --> 19:27.671
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

19:27.873 --> 19:31.832
After you do all this work and become
a big player at your company...

19:32.044 --> 19:34.342
...do you think you're gonna
have more time for us...

19:34.547 --> 19:37.072
...or are things just gonna get
even more out of control?

19:37.283 --> 19:40.150
Wait. When I get to that place
and become a boss...

19:40.352 --> 19:43.014
...a millionaire, a big shot,
the first thing I'm gonna do...

19:43.222 --> 19:45.884
...is hire a bunch of idiots just like me
to do all my work.

19:46.091 --> 19:49.288
So then you, me and the kids
can do whatever the hell we want.

19:49.495 --> 19:51.429
You just gotta give me some time.

19:53.799 --> 19:55.630
Don't give me that look.

19:55.835 --> 19:59.168
I'm just saying, give me some support.
All right?

19:59.371 --> 20:01.635
I love you. Go to sleep.

20:01.841 --> 20:04.901
- Just think about it, Michael.
- Absolutely.

20:05.110 --> 20:06.304
And stop with the Yodels.

20:06.512 --> 20:08.707
- You're gonna wake up 400 pounds.
- Okay.

20:21.227 --> 20:24.993
Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down, dude.
Everybody's sleeping.

20:27.366 --> 20:28.526
You gotta poop again?

20:29.168 --> 20:31.898
Why don't you do the humpy-pumpy
on the duck, okay?

20:33.305 --> 20:38.265
Will you just hold it in for five minutes
and keep the freaking volume down?

21:04.069 --> 21:05.263
I guess when you combine...

21:05.471 --> 21:08.872
...mass quantities of cough syrup
with Yodels...

21:09.074 --> 21:11.235
...you get acid.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.411
Go.

21:24.390 --> 21:26.688
Hey, you said you gotta go.
Go already, man.

21:33.265 --> 21:35.096
Sniffy Longdroppings, today.

22:06.198 --> 22:07.790
Holy motherfu...!

22:10.035 --> 22:12.162
Yeah, I mean, you're right.
In the short run...

22:12.371 --> 22:14.839
...plastic surgery is a hassle.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.372
But six months later...

22:17.576 --> 22:19.237
...l'm gonna have a face
and a body...

22:19.445 --> 22:21.811
...that's gonna get me to places
where I wanna be.

22:23.916 --> 22:26.976
Oh, my mother, typical,
you know, she says:

22:27.186 --> 22:30.349
"Oh, this procedure is too risky."

22:30.556 --> 22:33.923
If Samantha wanted her cheekbones
shaved down, I think I'd freak out too.

22:34.126 --> 22:37.254
I know, but I just think, you know,
they're too Slavic.

22:37.463 --> 22:39.090
You should get some work done.

22:39.298 --> 22:42.734
Then maybe Michael
will wanna hang out with you too.

22:44.536 --> 22:47.994
Morning, Michael.
You're looking very crappy today.

22:48.207 --> 22:51.267
Morning, Janine,
you're looking very Slavic.

22:52.845 --> 22:56.542
You're just jealous because Donna
and I are going to the gym...

22:56.749 --> 22:58.842
...and all the guys
are gonna be hitting on us.

23:03.422 --> 23:06.255
Michael knows
he's my one and only.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.686
Forever and ever, babe.

23:08.494 --> 23:11.793
Sorry about last night.
And I love you. I'm s...

23:11.997 --> 23:14.465
Oh, my God. I want that so bad.

23:14.666 --> 23:19.569
A husband that I can kiss and love
and give juice to.

23:19.772 --> 23:23.538
You've already cheated on three
different husbands with their brothers.

23:23.742 --> 23:26.540
I think you've given enough juice
to everybody.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.741
Love juice.

23:30.215 --> 23:32.649
You know way too much about me.

23:32.851 --> 23:35.752
I should never have done
that Montel Williams show.

23:35.954 --> 23:37.819
Even Montel Williams
thinks you're crazy...

23:38.023 --> 23:39.354
...and he's seen a lot of shit.

23:39.925 --> 23:42.553
I was desperate for companionship!

23:42.761 --> 23:44.490
All of my husbands...

23:44.696 --> 23:47.164
All of them
have emotionally abandoned me.

23:47.366 --> 23:51.132
They went to work. You had sex
with their unemployed brothers.

23:51.336 --> 23:53.304
- You're a horndog.
- Michael.

23:53.505 --> 23:55.632
- Okay, sweetie. Calm it down.
- No, no!

23:55.841 --> 23:59.242
I have had self-esteem issues
since I was a kid.

23:59.445 --> 24:03.438
I had a rabbit named Pepper.
And that rabbit abandoned me too!

24:03.649 --> 24:06.243
Even the rabbit did! Even the rabb...

24:12.391 --> 24:13.415
Don't look at me!

24:14.059 --> 24:16.027
- What's wrong with me?
- Bunny rabbit, bunny...

24:19.231 --> 24:22.667
<i>Here's the pitch to Matsui.
A deep drive.</i>

24:22.868 --> 24:25.098
<i>Oh, my, it's out of here!</i>

24:25.304 --> 24:30.241
<i>A two-run shot into the right-field
seats for Hideki Matsui.</i>

24:31.243 --> 24:32.642
I'm sorry. What was that?

24:32.845 --> 24:35.473
She has so many problems.
Why do you have to be so mean?

24:37.116 --> 24:39.744
I don't know, l... Hello.

24:41.553 --> 24:43.214
I gotta go.

24:47.192 --> 24:49.387
Yeah, good RoboDog.

24:49.595 --> 24:52.063
And he can bark
in over six different languages.

24:52.264 --> 24:53.959
It's so cool.

24:54.166 --> 24:56.930
Yeah, it's much cooler
than your stupid, human dog.

24:57.136 --> 25:00.003
Hey, Dad, see Kevin's
new robot dog?

25:00.205 --> 25:01.934
Yeah, yeah. Very nice.

25:02.141 --> 25:05.736
"Very nice"? This thing
is worth more than your car.

25:07.646 --> 25:10.911
- Not anymore it ain't.
- RoboDog!

25:17.890 --> 25:19.790
Hey, hey, hey.

25:19.992 --> 25:24.361
Okay. Is this some sort
of reality show? Are you the host?

25:24.563 --> 25:26.963
Morty? Where are the cameras?

25:27.166 --> 25:31.933
Got everybody in on it, huh?
Sundance did very well also.

25:33.071 --> 25:37.269
<i>All right, America! Have your laugh!
I'm an idiot!</i>

25:37.843 --> 25:39.936
Donna, I'm gonna get you!

25:40.145 --> 25:41.806
<i>Fast-forward.</i>

25:43.515 --> 25:45.312
Nobody's laughing at you, Michael.

25:45.517 --> 25:50.955
You wanted a universal remote control
that remote-controls your universe.

25:52.090 --> 25:55.457
Yeah, but what controls
my dance skills?

26:03.335 --> 26:04.495
Oh, Morty likes it too.

26:06.738 --> 26:08.638
Michael, just hit menu.

26:09.508 --> 26:10.634
On the remote?

26:10.842 --> 26:14.505
No, the menu at the Red Lobster.
Yes, on the remote.

26:20.419 --> 26:21.681
Where are we?

26:26.124 --> 26:28.422
<i>- Go, Michael, go!
- One Mississippi. Two Mississippi.</i>

26:28.627 --> 26:31.596
<i>- What have I got here?
- Two, three.</i>

26:31.797 --> 26:34.288
Cough syrup's kicking in again.

26:34.499 --> 26:37.662
<i>- We have a boy!
- Is it gonna work?</i>

26:37.869 --> 26:38.995
What is this?

26:39.204 --> 26:41.798
<i>- All right, I love you, Michael.
- Your life menu.</i>

26:42.774 --> 26:44.605
My life has a commentary?

26:44.810 --> 26:47.108
It's chock-full of goodies.

26:47.312 --> 26:50.042
- Click it.
- Click it.

26:51.450 --> 26:53.941
This is last Tuesday.

26:54.152 --> 26:58.145
<i>Michael was eagerly awaiting
the arrival of his lunch order.</i>

26:58.357 --> 26:59.915
Who's that, James Earl Jones?

27:00.125 --> 27:02.616
James Earl
does a lot of voice-over work.

27:02.828 --> 27:05.160
<i>But his anticipation
quickly turned to dismay...</i>

27:05.364 --> 27:07.958
<i>... as he realized Alice
had brought him a cheeseburger...</i>

27:08.166 --> 27:09.997
<i>... instead of a hamburger
as he requested.</i>

27:10.202 --> 27:12.227
A cheeseburger?
I said a hamburger.

27:12.437 --> 27:13.597
She always does this to me.

27:13.805 --> 27:16.706
<i>Michael considered demanding
that Alice scrape the cheese off...</i>

27:16.908 --> 27:17.932
<i>... but decided not to...</i>

27:18.143 --> 27:19.701
<i>... fearing that Alice may spit in...</i>

27:19.911 --> 27:23.472
<i>... or otherwise defile
the burger in some manner.</i>

27:23.682 --> 27:25.309
<i>A wise decision...</i>

27:25.517 --> 27:29.578
<i>... for that was exactly
what Alice was planning to do.</i>

27:30.989 --> 27:33.219
- Are you kidding me?
- Sneaky.

27:33.425 --> 27:35.655
My God.

27:39.298 --> 27:41.391
What else we got here?

27:42.968 --> 27:45.436
- "Making of"?
- Just click.

27:46.471 --> 27:49.440
Hey, hey, psychedelic.
Where are we?

27:50.976 --> 27:52.967
Is this a porno or something?

27:53.178 --> 27:55.544
Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy!

27:55.747 --> 27:57.009
Is that my parents?

27:57.215 --> 27:59.581
They're making you.
Like bunny rabbits.

27:59.785 --> 28:02.481
- That's the spot.
- Smack my heinie!

28:02.688 --> 28:05.919
Change the channel!
How do you do this?

28:07.225 --> 28:08.624
I can't see.

28:08.827 --> 28:11.887
- What happened?
- What...?

28:12.097 --> 28:16.534
The floor is so mushy and slippery.
Feels good on my feet.

28:16.735 --> 28:19.863
Check it out.
You hit the fast-forward button.

28:20.072 --> 28:22.632
I believe we're sometime
after your conception.

28:22.841 --> 28:25.173
Okay, very good, Mrs. Newman.

28:25.377 --> 28:28.471
No! We're in my mother's vagina?

28:28.680 --> 28:31.376
Again. And push.

28:31.583 --> 28:34.416
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl!

28:34.619 --> 28:37.611
- Oh, It's a girl. Thank you so much.
- Thank you for that.

28:37.823 --> 28:40.291
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry, it might be a boy.

28:40.492 --> 28:42.392
What do you mean, "might be"?
What is that?

28:42.594 --> 28:43.788
Maybe that's a penis.

28:43.995 --> 28:46.555
Maybe that's a pe...? That's a penis.
That's my penis.

28:46.765 --> 28:49.893
Can I see that?
Can you bring that a little closer?

28:50.102 --> 28:51.069
See?

28:51.503 --> 28:53.528
- That's a tiny schmeckel.
- Yeah?

28:53.739 --> 28:55.206
- We have a boy!
- We have a boy!

28:55.407 --> 28:59.673
Your mother must have
some superpower eyesight...

28:59.878 --> 29:02.813
...because I didn't see anything.

29:03.014 --> 29:04.208
Let's get out of here.

29:06.485 --> 29:08.453
So if you think about it...

29:08.653 --> 29:12.180
...I can reexperience
any part of my life I want to.

29:12.391 --> 29:13.915
It's amazing.

29:15.127 --> 29:18.460
What happened?
Oh, God, what did I do?

29:18.663 --> 29:20.756
Hello? How do I get you
back here, pal?

29:22.033 --> 29:23.000
Gotcha.

29:24.236 --> 29:25.863
I'm not freaked out enough?

29:26.071 --> 29:27.902
It's simple. Think of a time
and a place...

29:28.106 --> 29:30.666
...hit rewind, and you're there.

29:31.810 --> 29:34.301
Time and a place. Time and a place.

29:40.152 --> 29:43.178
Oh, my God. Lake Winnipesaukee.

29:43.655 --> 29:45.885
That's me in the Jets shirt.

29:46.091 --> 29:47.752
Go, little me, go!

29:51.163 --> 29:53.131
Good hands! Nice hands.

29:53.331 --> 29:54.559
Michael!

29:55.066 --> 29:59.366
Michael, dinner's almost ready.
Invite your friends if you want to.

29:59.971 --> 30:03.407
So any of you wanna come
by my tent for some supper?

30:03.608 --> 30:06.543
<i>Or we could eat at my Winnebago
and watch Three's Company.</i>

30:09.281 --> 30:10.873
<i>Three's Company.</i>

30:11.416 --> 30:13.714
That's humiliating.

30:15.587 --> 30:19.546
Mom, why can't we camp in an RV
like every other family?

30:19.758 --> 30:21.589
Oh, come on.
You call that camping?

30:21.793 --> 30:24.387
How can you get close to nature
in a tin can like that?

30:24.596 --> 30:28.088
Plus, it's more fun to have
to keep each other warm at night.

30:28.633 --> 30:30.225
Don't you know it.

30:39.377 --> 30:42.107
- No cupcakes yet.
- But I'm starving.

30:42.314 --> 30:44.578
I agree with you, Michael.
You know how hungry I am?

30:44.783 --> 30:47.775
I am so hungry, I could eat this.

30:47.986 --> 30:50.454
Oh, this is where
the quarter trick started.

30:56.995 --> 30:58.587
How the heck did he do that?

30:58.797 --> 31:01.960
Oh, it's a trick coin
you buy at a magic shop.

31:02.167 --> 31:04.192
I just couldn't let him know
I knew that.

31:04.402 --> 31:05.869
That's sweet.

31:06.071 --> 31:09.006
Now, I gotta get back to work,
so hit play.

31:17.048 --> 31:20.643
It's a very powerful device.
Use it with caution.

31:20.852 --> 31:22.285
Okay.

31:23.822 --> 31:24.811
Who are you?

31:25.624 --> 31:27.114
You know who I am.

31:28.159 --> 31:29.285
Morty?

31:29.494 --> 31:31.985
If you have any questions...

31:32.597 --> 31:34.189
...call me.

31:42.641 --> 31:47.476
No, Linda, I think Stacy gets
the most-beautiful-feet award.

31:47.679 --> 31:49.203
You wanted to see me?

31:49.414 --> 31:52.474
Michael. Look, I'm heading out to
the Hamptons in a couple of minutes.

31:52.684 --> 31:53.810
I'm counting on you.

31:54.019 --> 31:56.078
This hotel project? It's a big fish.

31:56.288 --> 32:00.156
You reel it in for me
and it's "Howdy, partner."

32:03.628 --> 32:05.027
Okay. Thank you.

32:05.230 --> 32:08.961
Screw it up, though, and it's
"Back to the mailroom, atrium boy."

32:11.570 --> 32:12.867
<i>Mr. Ammer, Denise just called.</i>

32:13.071 --> 32:16.438
<i>She's gotta go to rehab again,
so she can't make it to the Hamptons.</i>

32:16.641 --> 32:18.871
I'm gonna be alone
on the Fourth of July?

32:19.244 --> 32:21.974
Mr. Ammer, if you need female
companionship this weekend...

32:22.180 --> 32:24.671
...my wife's friend Janine, wow.

32:26.217 --> 32:29.448
Really? What's she like?

32:30.121 --> 32:34.888
Let's just say
she will eat you up, sir.

32:37.028 --> 32:38.586
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt...

32:38.797 --> 32:40.924
...but this is kind of important.
- Okay.

32:42.834 --> 32:44.893
- Go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

32:56.114 --> 32:59.140
Dude! You suck so bad.

32:59.351 --> 33:01.410
Do not. Hey, Dad.

33:01.620 --> 33:03.383
How you doing, buddy?
Playing some catch?

33:03.588 --> 33:07.422
Actually, we're playing some drop,
because Ben hasn't caught one yet.

33:07.626 --> 33:09.389
Darn it.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.570
You're a regular Derek Jeter
yourself, O'Doyle.

33:25.944 --> 33:28.435
- Love you, kid.
- Love you too, Dad.

33:29.214 --> 33:31.739
Mommy!

33:32.550 --> 33:35.212
No, I know. Well, I thought
she should've gotten voted off.

33:35.420 --> 33:37.854
But did you see her Kate Spade
handbag? It was gorgeous.

33:38.056 --> 33:40.684
Wait, hold on a second, Trudy.
I gotta say hi to your son.

33:40.892 --> 33:44.919
- I told your parents to come for dinner.
- Really? That sounds good.

33:45.130 --> 33:47.530
It'd be fun for them to be here
for the sleepover.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.029
Okay, so great. Yeah.

33:51.236 --> 33:53.636
We'll see you guys later.
Okay, bye-bye.

33:53.838 --> 33:56.966
It's not gonna kill you to eat dinner
with your family, sweetie.

33:57.175 --> 34:00.008
I know, I just gotta build
an entire model tonight.

34:01.346 --> 34:04.804
- I'm the leader!
- No, I'm the leader!

34:06.785 --> 34:08.719
Go say hi to Daddy. Go on.

34:11.723 --> 34:14.190
I can't take a whole night of this.

34:14.391 --> 34:17.690
<i>- And I'm not going to.
- Q, R, S, T, U...</i>

34:23.768 --> 34:25.167
Cool.

34:25.370 --> 34:28.567
I can skip chapters.

34:34.379 --> 34:35.710
What a family.

34:37.415 --> 34:41.181
All right, let's get dinner
over with. Next.

34:41.386 --> 34:42.819
Next.

34:43.021 --> 34:46.047
Everyone's done but you, buddy.
Let's go.

34:48.126 --> 34:50.492
Will you stop already?

34:50.695 --> 34:54.563
Oh, boy, Dad's quarter trick.
I can't wait not to see it.

34:56.534 --> 34:58.331
Alone in my basement at last.

34:58.536 --> 35:02.597
Should I do my work
and become partner now? I think so.

35:04.242 --> 35:06.107
Let's get to it.

35:06.911 --> 35:08.378
- Michael?
- Yo.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.138
We don't wanna interrupt.

35:10.348 --> 35:12.179
We're taking off.
Thanks for a great night.

35:12.383 --> 35:14.044
You had a fun time
hanging out with me?

35:14.252 --> 35:16.186
That was... We did good, right?

35:16.755 --> 35:18.245
- Good night, honey.
- Love you.

35:18.823 --> 35:22.953
My schmeckel got bigger now that
I'm older, just so you guys know that.

35:23.161 --> 35:25.561
It couldn't have gotten any smaller.

35:26.364 --> 35:27.456
Yeah, yeah.

35:27.665 --> 35:30.759
It looked like a little Tic Tac.

35:30.969 --> 35:34.029
Yeah, come here,
I'll freshen your breath.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.673
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, sweetie.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.775
Good night, sweetie.

35:41.346 --> 35:42.904
Great dinner, honey.

35:43.114 --> 35:45.378
See? Was that so bad?

35:45.583 --> 35:47.448
Kidding me? I had fun.

35:47.652 --> 35:51.383
Good for you. Can you watch the gang
for 10 minutes while I clean up?

35:51.589 --> 35:53.887
Can't you? I just...
I got so much stuff to do here.

35:54.092 --> 35:55.491
Oh, you got stuff to do?

35:55.693 --> 35:58.127
I got ghost stories, charades,
the dishes...

35:58.329 --> 36:01.093
...and then I gotta sew the duck's head
back on for Sundance...

36:01.299 --> 36:02.926
...and fix his butthole.

36:03.134 --> 36:04.226
Way to go, champ.

36:05.770 --> 36:07.635
I wish I had time to do all that stuff.

36:07.839 --> 36:09.272
Give me a break, Michael.

36:09.474 --> 36:11.442
You're a big boy.
You set your own priorities.

36:11.643 --> 36:14.009
I'm asking for 10 minutes,
not for, like, a whole day.

36:14.212 --> 36:15.577
You don't have to do that much.

36:15.780 --> 36:18.578
How big a deal is that?
I am so tired of having this argument.

36:26.424 --> 36:29.154
I skipped the whole fight.

36:32.230 --> 36:33.697
Babe?

36:35.166 --> 36:37.464
- I can't sleep.
- You can't?

36:37.669 --> 36:39.261
I feel bad that we keep arguing.

36:39.470 --> 36:42.598
I know. Don't be upset, okay?

36:42.807 --> 36:46.174
- I was a jerk.
- You are a jerk.

36:46.377 --> 36:47.935
- I love you.
- I love you too.

36:49.113 --> 36:51.104
- Yes. That smells good.
- What?

36:53.685 --> 36:55.744
Michael. Stop it.
The sleepover will catch us.

36:55.954 --> 36:58.047
They ain't gonna hear us. Come on.

36:58.823 --> 37:01.815
Okay. Quietly try
and coax me into it.

37:02.026 --> 37:04.017
I gotta get back to work.
Can't we just do it?

37:04.229 --> 37:06.197
No, we can't just do it.
Honey, come on.

37:06.731 --> 37:10.462
I mean, I don't have any new moves
for you. It's the same stuff.

37:10.668 --> 37:13.364
Just think of last time and use that.

37:13.571 --> 37:16.199
I like the old moves. Come on.

37:17.775 --> 37:18.742
All right.

37:18.943 --> 37:20.911
This time you be Sundance,
I'll be the duck.

37:21.112 --> 37:24.513
- Yeah?
- But you gotta massage me first.

37:24.716 --> 37:28.015
Great, I love giving massages.

37:33.057 --> 37:35.525
Massaging away here.

37:37.662 --> 37:40.722
Oh, that feels good.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:52.277 --> 37:55.610
- We did it?
- Well, you did.

37:57.148 --> 37:59.844
I didn't want the whole thing
to go that fast.

38:00.051 --> 38:02.349
I don't think anybody did.

38:02.754 --> 38:05.120
Yeah. I'll get you next time.

38:05.323 --> 38:06.950
Thanks.

38:07.926 --> 38:09.985
So we good for tomorrow?

38:11.629 --> 38:13.256
What are you talking about?

38:13.464 --> 38:14.692
At dinner.

38:14.899 --> 38:18.391
You said we'd go to lunch tomorrow
and pick out your dad's birthday gift.

38:21.339 --> 38:22.806
Dad's gift is...

38:23.007 --> 38:26.807
- Of course. I said so, so I'll be there.
- Okay.

38:27.645 --> 38:30.011
- Need another massage or anything?
- Oh, go away.

38:30.214 --> 38:32.079
I gotta go work.

38:33.451 --> 38:35.612
Hey, Morty. It's Michael Newman.

38:35.820 --> 38:38.288
Yeah, can I talk to you for a minute?

38:40.091 --> 38:42.685
Hang on for a second,
someone's at my door.

38:45.663 --> 38:48.564
- Hello, Michael.
- Where'd you come from?

38:49.267 --> 38:50.962
You don't wanna know.

38:53.571 --> 38:55.903
- Can we take a walk?
- Sure.

38:57.642 --> 39:01.043
It's simple. You must
have been on autopilot.

39:01.245 --> 39:02.337
Autopilot?

39:02.547 --> 39:05.107
That's what happens to you
when you fast-forward.

39:05.316 --> 39:07.250
- Okay.
- Yeah. I'll show you.

39:07.452 --> 39:08.851
Here.

39:12.590 --> 39:15.582
See? That's you on autopilot.

39:15.793 --> 39:18.353
The lights are on
but nobody's home.

39:18.563 --> 39:20.793
The remote lets your mind
skip around...

39:20.999 --> 39:23.593
...but your body actually stays put
for the boring stuff.

39:23.801 --> 39:26.827
We should go to lunch tomorrow
and pick out your dad's birthday gift.

39:27.038 --> 39:28.630
Sounds good.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.000
So she did tell me.

39:30.208 --> 39:33.200
I'm having conversations
on autopilot, then.

39:33.411 --> 39:35.971
You're not gonna be
the life of the party, but yes.

39:36.180 --> 39:38.444
Everyone goes on autopilot
now and then.

39:38.649 --> 39:41.516
The big difference
is now you've got a nifty remote...

39:41.719 --> 39:44.051
...to help you decide when.

39:44.255 --> 39:46.155
This thing is the best.

39:46.758 --> 39:50.216
By the way, your wife?
Absolutely gorgeous.

39:50.428 --> 39:54.990
- She is, isn't she?
- Perfect face. Tight, rocking body.

39:56.267 --> 39:57.234
You okay?

39:58.703 --> 40:01.035
- Amazing.
- What is?

40:01.239 --> 40:03.298
She fell for a schlub like you.

40:03.508 --> 40:05.100
I'm a schlub?

40:05.309 --> 40:08.244
I don't know about that, pal.
I see a good-looking man right there.

40:09.981 --> 40:13.144
You wanna see what a stud
I used to be? Yeah?

40:13.351 --> 40:15.615
All right, let's take a look
at some of the girls...

40:15.820 --> 40:18.414
...I used to fool around with
before I met Donna.

40:28.199 --> 40:30.224
Is that a man or a woman?

40:30.435 --> 40:32.369
It's a woman.

40:35.773 --> 40:37.673
<i>What is this, Animal Planet?</i>

40:39.477 --> 40:41.911
- Stop.
- Yes.

40:44.082 --> 40:49.952
Sometimes it's better to keep
certain memories just in your head.

40:50.154 --> 40:51.746
So I've learned, Morty.

40:51.956 --> 40:53.856
Good night. Thank you.

40:54.358 --> 40:56.121
Good night, Michael.

41:04.502 --> 41:07.938
I'm getting sick, man.
Fast-forward me till I'm better.

41:09.474 --> 41:12.875
Michael, honey, wake up.
You'll be late for work.

41:13.511 --> 41:16.571
What? It's Monday already?

41:25.756 --> 41:27.883
Are you kidding me?
No more phlegm?

41:28.092 --> 41:29.719
I skipped an entire cold?

41:29.927 --> 41:32.418
Thanks to you, baby! I love you!

41:32.630 --> 41:34.154
No more Tylenol!

41:34.365 --> 41:36.333
I don't remember doing
any work this weekend.

41:38.870 --> 41:40.497
But apparently I did.

41:41.038 --> 41:44.474
- Bad news. There's no hot water.
- What? I gotta take a shower.

41:44.675 --> 41:47.109
Well, you're gonna freeze
your bun-buns off.

41:48.079 --> 41:50.377
It's all good.

41:57.121 --> 41:59.055
Yes! Look at me.

41:59.257 --> 42:03.284
All showered and dressed
and looking sexy.

42:03.494 --> 42:05.189
I like that. L...

42:05.897 --> 42:08.161
Did you smoke crack, Daddy?

42:08.733 --> 42:11.793
Just watch your toons and have
a great day with Mommy today, okay?

42:14.972 --> 42:17.998
Eating cupcakes like your old man.
Right here, baby.

42:18.209 --> 42:19.767
- Dad?
- Yes, sir?

42:19.977 --> 42:22.502
Are you gonna have to work late
again tonight?

42:23.347 --> 42:26.783
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Is there anything we can do to help?

42:27.552 --> 42:30.919
Well, I'm gonna be partner soon, and
I'm gonna need new building designs.

42:31.122 --> 42:33.784
So if you guys have any cool ideas,
draw them up for me.

42:33.991 --> 42:35.458
- Okay.
- Rock 'n' roll.

42:35.660 --> 42:38.629
- I get the paper.
- I got the crayons.

42:44.402 --> 42:46.870
Would you stop talking
and fix the sewer?

43:06.624 --> 43:09.889
You're on it now, yeah. Yeah.

43:10.094 --> 43:13.825
Traffic, traffic, no more traffic.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.761
Wait a sec!

43:20.638 --> 43:23.072
Here we go! Mama!

43:23.274 --> 43:26.835
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about, baby!

43:29.547 --> 43:32.744
You look a little pale there, pal.
Let me fix that.

43:36.921 --> 43:40.857
Oh, look at you now.
You're all yellow from the scurvy.

43:41.058 --> 43:42.082
Captain.

43:44.829 --> 43:49.459
Don't get the Hulk angry.
You won't like him when he's angry.

44:00.278 --> 44:01.438
Oh, there's Barney.

44:01.646 --> 44:04.945
<i>I love you, you love me</i>

44:05.149 --> 44:09.449
<i>That jogger had giant boobies</i>

44:09.854 --> 44:14.086
Okay. Let's get you that tan
you been searching for.

44:14.292 --> 44:15.953
That's it. That's it.

44:16.160 --> 44:20.153
Check out Julio Iglesias... Pretty.

44:22.933 --> 44:26.994
- Looking good, Mr. Newman.
- Really? Thank you very much, Judy.

44:27.204 --> 44:30.935
- Finish?
- Did I finish? I believe I finished.

44:31.142 --> 44:34.578
- Let's see here. Look at that.
- Very impressive, Michael.

44:34.779 --> 44:38.738
Yeah, the river in the lobby.
This is actually pretty good, man.

44:39.417 --> 44:41.248
Where did you find the time
to get a tan?

44:42.753 --> 44:45.745
- I guess I can do it all, sir.
- You can do it all.

44:46.390 --> 44:50.486
All right, all right, everybody.
It's sexual-harassment-speech day.

44:51.862 --> 44:54.023
Now, anyone can be a victim
of sexual harassment:

44:54.231 --> 44:58.691
Blue collar, white collar,
a woman, a man.

44:58.903 --> 45:01.167
Even the office slut.

45:01.372 --> 45:03.806
Not that I'm mentioning any names...

45:04.008 --> 45:05.236
...Stacy.

45:08.746 --> 45:12.876
Here we go. Sexual harassment
can come in many forms.

45:14.318 --> 45:17.776
You see, what is hilarious to some,
could be offensive to others.

45:18.489 --> 45:22.289
Let me try to give you a real-life
example because I'm sure I've done it.

45:23.994 --> 45:27.521
Like the day I said, "You want
a promotion, break out the lotion."

45:27.732 --> 45:30.394
I was technically engaged
in sexual harassment.

45:31.168 --> 45:34.626
Hilarious sexual harassment,
if you ask me.

45:39.543 --> 45:44.344
Now, there is also
homosexual harassment.

45:44.548 --> 45:47.312
Now, this is like when
one dude comes up to another...

45:47.518 --> 45:49.918
...and says something cheeky.
- This will be good.

46:13.778 --> 46:15.040
Proceed.

46:20.985 --> 46:23.351
I don't know about you Americans...

46:23.554 --> 46:26.785
...but to me there is no doubt...

46:26.991 --> 46:29.858
...lchiro is the greatest of all time.

46:30.060 --> 46:31.618
Yeah, he's incredible.

46:31.829 --> 46:33.888
You gotta admit,
you can always count on Matsui.

46:34.098 --> 46:35.725
Oh, Matsui.

46:35.933 --> 46:39.391
Well, if you guys love Ichiro and
Matsui so much, let's order them both.

46:40.905 --> 46:42.634
I'll eat anything.

46:42.840 --> 46:46.241
- Excuse us for a moment.
- Absolutely, Mr. Watsuhita.

46:46.444 --> 46:48.537
See you guys in a bit.

46:48.746 --> 46:52.807
Ichiro and Matsui are baseball players.
You just insulted their national heroes.

46:53.017 --> 46:55.542
I'm going to the bathroom
to slit my wrists.

46:55.753 --> 46:57.448
I'll be here.

47:13.704 --> 47:14.864
These morons are so boring.

47:15.072 --> 47:17.233
They make me wanna
chop my own dick off.

47:18.542 --> 47:20.339
That hotel design?
I'd like to rip it up.

47:20.544 --> 47:23.138
Egghead watched a bad documentary
on Asian architecture.

47:23.347 --> 47:25.076
Who needs a stupid river
in the lobby?

47:25.282 --> 47:27.273
Let's build more rooms
and maximize profits.

47:27.485 --> 47:29.077
Eat as fast as you can.

47:29.286 --> 47:30.583
Then we can get out of here...

47:30.788 --> 47:33.689
...and do Jell-O shots at America's
greatest cultural achievement:

47:33.891 --> 47:34.915
T.G.I. Friday's.

47:35.125 --> 47:36.615
T.G.I. Friday's!

47:40.231 --> 47:43.962
- All right, Michael, save us.
- I'm all over it, baby.

47:45.302 --> 47:49.170
Before we order, I was looking
at our proposal. You know what?

47:49.373 --> 47:53.002
After getting to know you a little bit,
I realize this is not what you're about.

47:53.210 --> 47:56.475
In fact, let's just throw it out, all right?
Start from scratch.

47:56.680 --> 47:59.547
The river in the lobby idea,
what an egghead move.

47:59.750 --> 48:03.584
Let's just keep the plans simple, forget
all the niceties, maximize our revenue.

48:03.787 --> 48:05.880
That's what it's all about anyways,
the profits.

48:06.090 --> 48:09.321
But do me a favor. Just give us
your account and your trust.

48:09.527 --> 48:12.792
That way we can get the hell out
of this dump, go to T.G.I. Friday's...

48:12.997 --> 48:15.727
...do some Jell-O shots
till this guy pukes up a lung.

48:17.535 --> 48:18.695
Fuck, yeah.

48:22.339 --> 48:24.068
That's what I'm talking about.

48:30.414 --> 48:31.881
Yes, yes!

48:32.082 --> 48:36.041
The king is home! Hello, hello!

48:37.221 --> 48:41.248
How can you goons sleep
when you know I got you presents?

48:41.458 --> 48:42.891
- You did?
- What is it?

48:43.093 --> 48:47.189
What is it? Well, if you bring
your tushies downstairs, we'll find out.

48:48.198 --> 48:50.063
I'm coming. I'm coming.

48:50.267 --> 48:54.203
Honey, get your sweet little buns
downstairs too. Come on, come on!

48:57.775 --> 48:59.834
Come and get them.

49:00.711 --> 49:03.771
- Awesome! No way!
- Yeah, yeah.

49:04.548 --> 49:08.040
- It must have cost a million dollars!
- That's chump change now.

49:08.252 --> 49:09.446
You guys deserve the best...

49:09.653 --> 49:12.053
...and that's what you're gonna get
from now on, okay?

49:12.256 --> 49:13.553
What's all this?

49:13.757 --> 49:15.850
Look who's here.
You guys wanna ride these bikes?

49:16.060 --> 49:18.051
- Yeah!
- Let's take them outside!

49:18.262 --> 49:20.526
Wake the O'Doyles,
let them see what you got.

49:24.501 --> 49:27.902
These are the coolest bikes
in the whole town.

49:28.105 --> 49:30.539
Kevin O'Doyle's gonna shit himself.

49:30.741 --> 49:34.108
- Don't think I forgot my beautiful wife.
- Oh, my gosh.

49:34.311 --> 49:38.179
It's not a bike or a cowboy hat,
but you're gonna like this, I hope.

49:38.549 --> 49:41.882
- Oh, Michael, it's beautiful.
- I heard you talking to my mother.

49:42.086 --> 49:44.316
- I love it!
- You look good, baby.

49:44.521 --> 49:47.718
I got myself a celebratory cigar too.
Why not?

49:47.925 --> 49:49.483
What are we celebrating?

49:49.693 --> 49:53.993
"What are we celebrating?"
We're healthy, we got a great family...

49:54.198 --> 49:56.462
...l'm Ammer's newest partner...

49:56.667 --> 50:00.068
Oh, my God, you're kidding!
Honey, congratulations!

50:00.270 --> 50:03.501
I knew it! I knew you'd be psyched!
I love it! I love you!

50:03.707 --> 50:05.971
I single-handedly landed
the Watsuhita account.

50:06.176 --> 50:08.542
That's incredible.
I knew it was gonna be a great day.

50:08.746 --> 50:11.647
- I heard our song on the radio.
- We have a song?

50:12.216 --> 50:16.653
Honey. The song that was playing
during our first kiss.

50:18.722 --> 50:20.656
Come on. You're kidding me, right?

50:22.493 --> 50:27.521
I know our song. Our song. Of course
I know our song. Our song is...

50:27.731 --> 50:30.029
What the hell was that song?

50:32.036 --> 50:33.970
I remember this place.

50:34.171 --> 50:37.072
And... Oh, my God.

50:37.274 --> 50:40.038
Wolverine's goofy cousin.

50:40.778 --> 50:45.806
But look at you. Wow.
You are out of his league, aren't you?

50:48.519 --> 50:50.146
Oh, yeah, the notes.

50:50.354 --> 50:52.345
Smooth, buddy.

50:58.195 --> 50:59.856
Oh, look at her.

51:01.398 --> 51:05.334
What's gonna happen?
You got an answer to that?

51:08.572 --> 51:12.064
Okay. Seal the deal, pal.

51:19.550 --> 51:22.314
All she's thinking about is,
"I am not kissing that beard.

51:22.519 --> 51:24.180
Absolutely not,
that's gonna hurt me."

51:24.922 --> 51:26.685
Wait a minute.

51:29.593 --> 51:31.891
Yeah, Newman. Get it.

51:33.664 --> 51:35.325
Yeah.

51:39.002 --> 51:40.492
Donna!

51:40.704 --> 51:43.332
Donna. Oh, my God.

51:44.141 --> 51:45.768
I'm so horny now.

51:45.976 --> 51:49.673
Oh, God, I'm not.
Get me out of here.

51:51.849 --> 51:56.479
"Linger" by The Cranberries
was playing during our first juicy kiss.

51:56.687 --> 52:00.145
And, my God, you looked beautiful
in that pink sweater you were wearing.

52:00.357 --> 52:02.018
Honey, you remember
what I was wearing?

52:02.226 --> 52:04.194
Of course. I remember
what Janine was wearing.

52:04.394 --> 52:06.624
She scared the shit out of me then.

52:10.134 --> 52:11.761
I love you.

52:11.969 --> 52:14.665
I love you too, honey.

52:25.449 --> 52:27.508
Hi, Mr. Newman.

52:28.051 --> 52:30.315
Right this way, Michael.

52:31.622 --> 52:34.955
Hey, my new star. Congratulations.
Sit down, big guy.

52:35.159 --> 52:36.717
All right.

52:36.927 --> 52:39.361
I am a little tired.

52:39.563 --> 52:41.895
The family was up late
last night celebrating.

52:42.099 --> 52:44.932
You really knocked one out of the park
last night, didn't you?

52:45.135 --> 52:46.261
Hey, you were great too.

52:46.470 --> 52:48.700
All you gotta do is draw up
the construction plans.

52:48.906 --> 52:50.999
If Watsuhita commits
to the bulk of the funds...

52:51.208 --> 52:53.506
...l'm looking at my new partner.

52:56.513 --> 52:58.310
I thought I was already your partner.

52:59.049 --> 53:00.516
Whoa, cowboy.

53:00.717 --> 53:03.515
I said, "Land the Watsuhita account,
you'll get promoted."

53:03.720 --> 53:08.123
- I didn't mean right this second.
- But I already told my wife, sir.

53:08.325 --> 53:10.657
I spent money I don't have.

53:10.861 --> 53:13.762
To do these documents
is gonna take me months.

53:14.431 --> 53:16.456
Then you better get started.

53:23.907 --> 53:25.772
Wow, I just got a big headache!

53:27.477 --> 53:30.503
- Was I hit by a train or something?
- I didn't see anything.

53:30.714 --> 53:35.014
I forgot to tell you. I hung out
with your friend Janine this weekend.

53:35.219 --> 53:39.178
I hope she's doing your brother
right now, you big-headed buffoon.

53:49.099 --> 53:50.532
No, no, no. You got more.

53:53.003 --> 53:54.800
Yeah.

53:56.773 --> 54:00.641
Anyway, the sooner
you get back to work...

54:00.844 --> 54:02.709
...the sooner you'll be partnerized.

54:02.913 --> 54:05.313
- I taste shit.
- You do?

54:06.049 --> 54:11.544
Stacy! Did you put shit in my lunch?

54:12.723 --> 54:14.588
I'm gonna get going now, sir.

54:14.791 --> 54:16.884
Stacy!

54:22.699 --> 54:24.667
Have you considered
the consequences...

54:24.868 --> 54:27.166
...of the thing
you're thinking about doing?

54:27.704 --> 54:30.070
Yeah. What are you saying,
I shouldn't do it?

54:30.274 --> 54:34.108
It's your life. What you do with
the remote is your decision, Michael.

54:34.311 --> 54:38.407
I know, so, I mean,
we're talking a couple of months here.

54:38.615 --> 54:41.140
I fast-forward through it,
what am I gonna miss?

54:41.351 --> 54:43.114
Thirty arguments and a haircut?

54:43.654 --> 54:45.383
Remember the leprechaun?

54:46.423 --> 54:49.187
The one from the cereal ad.

54:50.661 --> 54:53.721
"They're magically delicious."
That guy?

54:53.931 --> 54:57.560
He's always chasing the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

54:57.768 --> 55:01.499
But when he gets there
at the end of the day...

55:03.006 --> 55:05.236
...it's just corn flakes.

55:11.615 --> 55:13.378
- Michael.
- Yes.

55:13.583 --> 55:17.713
- You don't understand the metaphor?
- I won't do it, all right.

55:34.137 --> 55:35.695
- Dad?
- Yeah.

55:35.906 --> 55:39.273
- We have some designs for you.
- It's not a good time, man.

55:39.476 --> 55:41.467
Maybe they'll help you
finish quicker.

55:41.678 --> 55:44.203
All right. You want me to look at it?
Let me see.

55:44.848 --> 55:47.976
The ceiling's too high,
the hallway's too narrow...

55:48.185 --> 55:50.415
...stairway placement
makes no sense at all.

55:50.620 --> 55:53.020
- What the hell's this room made of?
- Pizza.

55:53.223 --> 55:56.590
Well, it's stupid. Next.
What is yours made of?

55:57.060 --> 56:00.791
- Pickles.
- Oh, don't be a baby.

56:00.998 --> 56:04.058
Michael, have you lost your mind?
He's 7 years old.

56:04.267 --> 56:06.667
If he wants a playroom made of pizza,
then why not?

56:06.870 --> 56:10.067
Maybe he's gotta grow up sometime
and get the hell off Fantasy Island.

56:10.273 --> 56:13.538
Hey, pizza boy.
Life ain't about being creative.

56:13.744 --> 56:17.043
It's about kissing ass, playing it safe,
making your boss a lot of money...

56:17.247 --> 56:20.148
...in hopes one day he might throw you
a stinking bone. All right?

56:20.350 --> 56:22.045
Yes, sir.

56:22.486 --> 56:24.215
Ammer didn't make you partner,
did he?

56:26.356 --> 56:29.154
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

56:29.760 --> 56:32.024
But we'll get through this, okay?
I promise.

56:32.429 --> 56:35.023
Jeez! Man, that's all we ever do
is get through it.

56:35.232 --> 56:37.393
When is it gonna end?

56:53.884 --> 56:55.146
Pretty sweet, eh?

56:55.352 --> 56:58.185
Two queen beds, full kitchen,
steam shower...

56:58.388 --> 57:00.549
...and satellite TV
with surround sound.

57:01.691 --> 57:05.354
Why are you always trying to hurt me?
One day I'm gonna hurt you back.

57:05.562 --> 57:08.554
Michael Newman,
I didn't know you smoked cigars.

57:08.765 --> 57:10.392
And now's the time.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.158
No, Kathy, this isn't mine.

57:12.369 --> 57:15.896
I took it out of Kevin's hands.
Yeah, he was smoking like a chimney.

57:16.106 --> 57:17.403
No, I wasn't!

57:17.607 --> 57:19.370
I think I smell marijuana in it.

57:19.576 --> 57:22.875
Kevin O'Doyle, you get your ass
in this house right now!

57:23.080 --> 57:24.240
I hate you.

57:24.448 --> 57:27.884
Are you deaf? Move it!
I don't wanna have to ask you again!

57:28.085 --> 57:30.076
Dope is for dopes, buddy!

57:30.287 --> 57:32.187
Get your ass in this house!

57:34.424 --> 57:36.016
We don't have
any other choice, guys.

57:36.226 --> 57:40.424
- No fair! I don't wanna return my bike!
- We have to, honey.

57:40.630 --> 57:43.394
- But Daddy gave them to us!
- Because he loves you.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.864
Unfortunately, there was
a mix-up at Daddy's work.

57:46.069 --> 57:47.969
We need to bring
the bikes back for now.

57:48.171 --> 57:51.368
But I already told Kevin O'Doyle
I got a new bike.

57:51.575 --> 57:54.339
Well, we can paint my old bike
and make it look new.

57:54.544 --> 57:58.378
That's a girl's bike.
All the kids will make fun of me.

57:58.782 --> 58:01.250
No!

58:02.652 --> 58:04.244
I wanna keep my bike!

58:04.454 --> 58:06.718
I can't take this anymore.

58:06.923 --> 58:08.584
Fast-forward me to my promotion.

58:14.097 --> 58:15.587
So here's to Michael Newman...

58:15.799 --> 58:18.791
...the greatest partner
I could ever dream of.

58:19.169 --> 58:20.796
Hear, hear!

58:21.271 --> 58:25.298
Thank you. Thank you, guys.
My family thanks you.

58:25.509 --> 58:28.774
I'm gonna do the best I can
and I won't let you down, I promise.

58:28.979 --> 58:30.640
Yeah!

58:31.314 --> 58:34.613
- Congratulations, Mr. Newman.
- This is great. Thank you.

58:34.818 --> 58:36.308
How's it feel, killer?

58:36.520 --> 58:39.318
- Feels incredible, sir.
- Well, you earned it. I'm telling you.

58:39.523 --> 58:41.684
Not just because of that
Watsuhita project either.

58:41.892 --> 58:45.623
For helping me pick up the slack
now I'm spending time with my lady.

58:45.829 --> 58:47.319
Hey, Dinkie.

58:47.998 --> 58:50.899
Are you kidding me? You guys have
been dating a couple months now?

58:51.101 --> 58:53.365
That's pretty huge for this one.

58:55.872 --> 58:57.863
No, the first few months were easy.

58:58.074 --> 59:00.338
It was the one-year hump
that was the tough part.

59:00.544 --> 59:04.605
Her inappropriate weekend
with my brother in Cabo...

59:04.814 --> 59:06.611
...well, that was
a potential speed bump.

59:06.816 --> 59:09.751
But, well, Dr. Bergman helped us
work through it, didn't he, honey?

59:09.953 --> 59:11.545
How's he doing for you and Donna?

59:12.055 --> 59:15.218
Dr. Bergman. What do you mean?

59:15.425 --> 59:18.622
Oh, you know what, sweetie?
It's none of our business.

59:18.828 --> 59:21.729
Let's let Michael bask in his glory.
Cheers.

59:21.932 --> 59:24.400
Bask away, partner.

59:25.168 --> 59:27.728
Took that bastard
a year to promote me?

59:29.272 --> 59:31.206
What else did I miss?

59:31.508 --> 59:33.806
- Shit.
- Need something, Mr. Newman?

59:33.977 --> 59:36.810
- Who are you?
- Kirsten, your assistant.

59:37.013 --> 59:38.605
What happened to Alice?

59:38.815 --> 59:41.249
She moved to Accounting.
Couldn't handle your hours.

59:41.818 --> 59:45.015
And she prefers to be called Alan now.
Remember?

59:48.858 --> 59:50.416
No.

59:50.927 --> 59:53.225
No.

59:53.430 --> 59:56.661
No! And who the hell's
Dr. Bergman?

59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.426
And I feel like Michael's making
no effort to connect with me at all.

01:00:00.637 --> 01:00:03.401
No, no. I want to. I want to.
It's... I'm on autopilot.

01:00:03.607 --> 01:00:06.576
"I'm on autopilot."
More like auto-zombie.

01:00:06.776 --> 01:00:08.073
Good one, Donna.

01:00:09.179 --> 01:00:12.273
- "Good one, Donna"?
- Michael, relax.

01:00:12.482 --> 01:00:15.076
Who is this bigmouth?
Why can't you and I just talk?

01:00:15.285 --> 01:00:18.345
Why? Because there is no talking
to you. You're never home to talk to.

01:00:18.555 --> 01:00:21.524
And when you are, you're just sitting
there staring off into space.

01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:22.953
What do you want from me?

01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:25.354
This is what happens.
He's gonna answer his phone.

01:00:27.264 --> 01:00:29.892
What the heck happened?
I didn't even touch the remote.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.091
Great, you gonna start watching TV
at dinner?

01:00:32.302 --> 01:00:33.769
Oh, can we?

01:00:34.337 --> 01:00:37.397
Samantha. My little angel.
Look at you.

01:00:37.607 --> 01:00:39.097
Look how long your hair's getting.

01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:41.368
When did you grow up?
Ben, get over here.

01:00:41.578 --> 01:00:43.307
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna work tonight.

01:00:43.513 --> 01:00:45.572
<i>Watch Dragon Tales together.
What do you say?</i>

01:00:45.782 --> 01:00:49.274
<i>Dragon Tales is for babies, Dad.
I wanna watch CSI.</i>

01:00:49.486 --> 01:00:51.386
<i>Yeah, CSI.</i>

01:00:51.588 --> 01:00:53.613
It's the episode
when they find the lady's arm.

01:00:53.823 --> 01:00:58.055
<i>What happened? I missed
the whole Dragon Tales era?</i>

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.261
Whoa, hey, hello.

01:01:06.703 --> 01:01:08.864
What are you doing?
Come here! Give me my Twinkie!

01:01:09.072 --> 01:01:10.596
Get back here,
you freaking gremlin!

01:01:10.807 --> 01:01:13.503
Don't yell at Peanut because
he found your Twinkie stash.

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:15.177
Who's Peanut? Where's Sundance?

01:01:15.378 --> 01:01:18.006
Don't mention Sundance.
The kids just stopped crying.

01:01:18.214 --> 01:01:19.647
About what? Why?
What happened?

01:01:22.185 --> 01:01:23.618
He died?

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:31.920
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.

01:01:32.128 --> 01:01:35.359
The stupid idiot and soft fur.

01:01:35.565 --> 01:01:38.693
- Daddy held it in so long.
- He was the best dog!

01:01:38.902 --> 01:01:41.427
He's finally letting himself feel it.

01:01:41.638 --> 01:01:45.836
One night when the duck's head
was off...

01:01:46.042 --> 01:01:48.738
...he tried to hump my leg
and I didn't let him...

01:01:48.945 --> 01:01:51.505
...and I should've and I'm sorry.

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:55.981
- What an idiot.
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:01:56.386 --> 01:01:58.684
What the heck did I do?

01:01:58.888 --> 01:02:01.857
I love you. Do you still love me?

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.524
Oh, Michael.

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:08.595
It's been...

01:02:08.798 --> 01:02:10.390
I'm really confused.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.400
No, no, no. I'll change, okay?
I'll be a better man, I promise.

01:02:14.604 --> 01:02:17.698
Don't go, don't go.
I'll stop working so much, okay?

01:02:17.907 --> 01:02:21.172
I'll be with you. Just stay with me.

01:02:21.378 --> 01:02:25.314
Oh, my God, it didn't take the duck
long to get over Sundance.

01:02:26.015 --> 01:02:29.473
It's a little deviant,
but it's kind of turning me on.

01:02:29.686 --> 01:02:32.314
Yeah, well, let's kiss and make up.

01:02:47.437 --> 01:02:50.201
No. No!

01:02:50.407 --> 01:02:52.534
It's not my fault.

01:02:52.742 --> 01:02:55.438
It jumped on its own.
I didn't even hit the button.

01:02:55.645 --> 01:02:57.044
Not even close.

01:03:00.216 --> 01:03:01.581
Yes?

01:03:05.088 --> 01:03:07.613
- You scared...
- Honey, what's going on down there?

01:03:07.824 --> 01:03:11.954
It's all right! L...
There was a mouse! I killed it!

01:03:12.162 --> 01:03:16.121
It's dead! But it broke the table first!

01:03:16.332 --> 01:03:19.927
- How did you get in here?
- I had a feeling you wanted to see me.

01:03:20.136 --> 01:03:22.070
I'm freaking out.
This thing, it's broken.

01:03:22.272 --> 01:03:24.763
It's just... It's fast-forwarding
on its own now.

01:03:24.974 --> 01:03:26.999
It's not a malfunction, it's a feature.

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:31.044
It's using its memory
to execute your preferences.

01:03:31.247 --> 01:03:33.078
It remembers stuff?
What do you mean?

01:03:33.283 --> 01:03:36.912
It's an advanced piece of equipment,
like TiVo.

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.081
You could call it MeVo.

01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:42.315
I fast-forwarded through sex one time,
I don't wanna skip it forever.

01:03:42.525 --> 01:03:44.152
I like sex. It feels good.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.558
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you
fast-forwarded through an entire year.

01:03:48.765 --> 01:03:50.289
That's a lot of sex.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.061
Put it all together,
that's like 30 minutes' worth for you.

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:56.636
Oh, no, no. So what,
everything I fast-forwarded...

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.172
...it's gonna do it on its own now?
- Pretty much.

01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.502
No more showering, no more traffic.

01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:04.236
No more arguing.
No more sickness.

01:04:04.447 --> 01:04:05.846
This is bad, this is bad.

01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:08.040
You take it back,
I'm deactivating my service.

01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:11.277
I quit, I quit. Thanks for everything,
all right, but l...

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:14.679
Yeah.

01:04:20.964 --> 01:04:24.491
You... This is not...

01:04:27.704 --> 01:04:28.966
Don't be mean.

01:04:32.542 --> 01:04:33.600
Nice hat.

01:04:34.344 --> 01:04:36.642
No, no, no.

01:04:39.682 --> 01:04:44.051
Get away from me. Just get away.
Get away. Leave me alone.

01:04:44.254 --> 01:04:48.088
Is this a stickup?
Or are you just happy?

01:04:50.026 --> 01:04:51.857
Yeah? I'm gonna
take my clothes off, then...

01:04:52.061 --> 01:04:53.653
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:56.696
There's only one place left
for it to pop up.

01:04:58.234 --> 01:05:01.829
Oh. No, no, I don't want that.
Come on, man.

01:05:02.038 --> 01:05:06.236
I told you,
this item is nonreturnable.

01:05:07.443 --> 01:05:10.435
- Come on, just take it.
- Until we meet again.

01:05:10.647 --> 01:05:15.550
Don't do that. Come on, Morty.
How do I get it to stop fast-forwarding?

01:05:18.321 --> 01:05:20.721
Morning, sweetie.

01:05:21.858 --> 01:05:23.485
You wanna shower first?

01:05:23.693 --> 01:05:27.424
Yeah. No! I can't shower
because then I'll fast-forward.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:30.428
And if I fast-forward, who knows
how long I'll fast-forward for.

01:05:30.633 --> 01:05:33.534
How's this? I'm gonna rough it today,
like in the Old West. Okay?

01:05:33.736 --> 01:05:36.330
Donna, I wanna tell you
what's going on right now so bad...

01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:39.838
...but it might lead to an argument.
We can't argue because off I'll go.

01:05:40.043 --> 01:05:41.670
So just know there is a problem.

01:05:41.878 --> 01:05:44.676
I tried to get rid of the problem,
it almost ended up in my ass.

01:05:44.881 --> 01:05:46.974
I'm gonna go to work
and try to figure this out.

01:05:47.183 --> 01:05:48.810
You're going to work
in your bathrobe?

01:05:49.018 --> 01:05:51.077
Honey. We can't argue, okay?
No more arguing.

01:05:51.287 --> 01:05:53.721
You're right. I'm wrong. All the time.
You want a kiss?

01:05:53.923 --> 01:05:56.619
- I'll take a kiss.
- I can't. If I give you a kiss...

01:05:56.826 --> 01:05:59.727
...it might lead to something else,
then... three minutes goes by.

01:05:59.929 --> 01:06:02.090
You're laying there disappointed,
I'm smiling.

01:06:02.298 --> 01:06:05.597
I wanna be with you every minute
of my life, that's why I gotta leave now.

01:06:05.802 --> 01:06:07.394
Have a great day!

01:06:07.604 --> 01:06:12.098
<i>Once again, Michael left Donna
in bed confused and unsatisfied.</i>

01:06:12.308 --> 01:06:13.900
Shut up, James Earl Jones!

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:17.045
<i>No, you shut up, big mouth!</i>

01:07:09.899 --> 01:07:11.833
Michael!

01:07:12.035 --> 01:07:13.832
<i>Mr. Ammer is here</i>

01:07:14.504 --> 01:07:18.338
Your first day as a partner, you come
to work in a fricking bathrobe?

01:07:18.541 --> 01:07:21.032
I did. I did.

01:07:21.244 --> 01:07:24.702
John, I just feel we should
stop wasting our energy...

01:07:24.914 --> 01:07:28.179
...on corporate brown-nosing and
worrying who's got the better suit.

01:07:28.384 --> 01:07:30.978
Armani, Calvin Klein, who cares?

01:07:31.187 --> 01:07:34.350
Let's concentrate
on what really matters, the work.

01:07:36.426 --> 01:07:38.690
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

01:07:40.763 --> 01:07:43.027
But goddamn it, you're right.

01:07:46.769 --> 01:07:50.170
Life-changing. I feel freer.

01:07:50.506 --> 01:07:51.871
Yeah... Keep the pants on.

01:07:52.675 --> 01:07:54.836
Sexual harassment, eh?

01:07:55.478 --> 01:07:57.378
Speaking of life-changing...

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.574
...there's something, or actually
someone, I'd like to talk to you about.

01:08:04.187 --> 01:08:06.018
- Janine.
- Everything okay?

01:08:06.222 --> 01:08:08.850
Michael, Janine and I decided
to drop out of the rat race...

01:08:09.058 --> 01:08:10.423
...slow down, move to Morocco.

01:08:10.626 --> 01:08:13.151
- Morocco?
- Morocco.

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:14.797
Okay.

01:08:14.997 --> 01:08:17.830
Eric Lamensoff will assume
my day-to-day responsibilities...

01:08:18.033 --> 01:08:20.194
...and I'd like you to take his job.

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:25.634
But Eric Lamensoff is the head
of the whole international division.

01:08:25.841 --> 01:08:27.832
- I've been your partner one day.
- So?

01:08:28.044 --> 01:08:30.808
Every account you worked on
turned into gold.

01:08:31.013 --> 01:08:32.571
You know, I wouldn't be surprised...

01:08:32.782 --> 01:08:35.080
...if one day you ended up
being our CEO.

01:08:36.219 --> 01:08:39.017
Hey, I would love
for that to happen, but...

01:08:39.221 --> 01:08:42.191
No! No, no, no!
I don't want a promotion!

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:45.224
No!

01:08:49.799 --> 01:08:52.596
<i>Michael, you have a phone call.</i>

01:08:52.801 --> 01:08:53.894
Michael Newman.

01:08:57.607 --> 01:08:58.733
<i>Word up, big guy.</i>

01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:02.399
<i>Ten years ago you told me
you wanted to be CEO.</i>

01:09:02.612 --> 01:09:05.944
<i>Great news.
Eric Lamensoff killed himself.</i>

01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:08.743
<i>So you better stop with the junk food,
Mr. Chairman...</i>

01:09:08.951 --> 01:09:11.283
<i>... or you'll end up
killing yourself too.</i>

01:09:14.857 --> 01:09:17.223
<i>Opening virtual blinds.</i>

01:09:17.426 --> 01:09:22.055
Ten years?
How much worse can things get?

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.404
Oh, my God, I'm a fat guy!

01:09:40.616 --> 01:09:42.082
Look at me.

01:09:48.157 --> 01:09:51.058
What is this? This is titties.

01:09:51.761 --> 01:09:53.786
I got juicy titties!

01:09:53.996 --> 01:09:55.725
What... What is that?

01:09:55.932 --> 01:09:59.663
Oh, God, no.

01:10:00.203 --> 01:10:01.693
Just take me home.

01:10:08.477 --> 01:10:11.844
<i>This is 1010 WINS news.
February 5th, 2017.</i>

01:10:12.048 --> 01:10:14.312
<i>Britney Spears
had her 23rd baby today.</i>

01:10:14.517 --> 01:10:17.884
<i>Proud father Kevin Federline says
he's now considering getting a job.</i>

01:10:18.087 --> 01:10:21.420
<i>Also, Michael Jackson,
the first man to clone himself...</i>

01:10:21.624 --> 01:10:24.320
<i>... is now suing himself
for molesting himself.</i>

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.539
Donna!

01:10:40.443 --> 01:10:42.172
Donna!

01:10:51.354 --> 01:10:52.412
Can I help you?

01:10:53.956 --> 01:10:57.619
- Hey, Dad.
- "Hey, Dad"?

01:10:57.827 --> 01:11:00.762
Ben? That's you?

01:11:00.963 --> 01:11:04.057
Look how big you got.
You're enormous.

01:11:04.634 --> 01:11:08.400
<i>Look who's talking, Captain Twinkie
of the S.S. Fat-Ass!</i>

01:11:08.604 --> 01:11:10.094
Really good for my self-esteem.

01:11:10.306 --> 01:11:12.706
Maybe if you would take me
to Pilates like you said...

01:11:12.909 --> 01:11:14.934
...people wouldn't think
I was Rosie O'Donnell!

01:11:15.144 --> 01:11:16.668
Come on, I love you!

01:11:16.879 --> 01:11:19.712
- Bring me back the Twinkies!
- You're so cruel!

01:11:19.916 --> 01:11:22.282
Will you please stop yelling?
It is so embarrassing.

01:11:22.485 --> 01:11:25.579
- Is that my daughter?
- Mom, I'm going to Derek's!

01:11:25.788 --> 01:11:29.349
That's you, Samantha?
When did you get boobs?

01:11:29.692 --> 01:11:32.286
The same time you did, Dad.
Now can I go?

01:11:32.495 --> 01:11:34.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who the hell's this Derek guy?

01:11:34.931 --> 01:11:38.094
My boyfriend, the hottest boy
in school, hello?

01:11:38.301 --> 01:11:40.269
He's gonna be hot
when I burn his house down.

01:11:40.469 --> 01:11:42.437
Get your ass upstairs,
put normal clothes on.

01:11:42.638 --> 01:11:45.471
- Why are you so mean to me?
- Get them on now!

01:11:45.675 --> 01:11:47.734
- And wipe off all that makeup!
- Right!

01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:51.873
Is Peanut dead too?

01:11:53.082 --> 01:11:55.642
This one's got the duck
doing all the work.

01:11:58.487 --> 01:12:00.216
Donna. Donna.

01:12:01.824 --> 01:12:03.314
Goddamn it.

01:12:03.526 --> 01:12:06.586
Look how gorgeous you look.
I'm so scared.

01:12:06.796 --> 01:12:09.856
- Knock, knock, gang.
- Hey, sweetie.

01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:17.031
What's going on?

01:12:17.239 --> 01:12:19.002
Donna and I were gonna get
hot chocolate.

01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:21.438
- You want us to bring you one?
- You cheating on me?

01:12:21.644 --> 01:12:23.236
With Johnny G-String over here?

01:12:23.446 --> 01:12:25.505
Come on. Time-out.
I thought we were past that.

01:12:25.715 --> 01:12:28.946
No, no, no, we're past this argument.
No, you're right, no big deal.

01:12:29.151 --> 01:12:31.915
Hey, it's just that you don't
mess with another man's wife!

01:12:32.121 --> 01:12:34.089
Michael! Stop it! Stop it, Michael!

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:36.258
It was your decision to move out!
So stay out!

01:12:36.459 --> 01:12:38.188
Get off me!
You sticking up for him?

01:12:38.394 --> 01:12:41.022
Go away! Go away, I hate you!

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:43.755
- We can't argue! Donna, please!
- I hate you! I hate you!

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.199
Oh, man!

01:12:46.402 --> 01:12:48.427
You hate me?

01:12:51.474 --> 01:12:55.240
No. No.

01:12:55.444 --> 01:12:58.004
Ten years, you're not finished yet?

01:12:58.381 --> 01:13:03.148
Morty! Why did you do this to me?

01:13:03.352 --> 01:13:05.616
You did this to yourself, Michael.

01:13:05.821 --> 01:13:08.221
No. No, I didn't wanna
waste all that time.

01:13:08.424 --> 01:13:09.823
I didn't wanna lose Donna!

01:13:10.026 --> 01:13:11.755
The remote goes by your behavior.

01:13:11.961 --> 01:13:15.453
Every time you had a conflict
between work and home, work won.

01:13:15.664 --> 01:13:17.154
- No, not true.
- Lie to your wife.

01:13:17.366 --> 01:13:19.960
Lie to yourself.
But you cannot lie to the remote.

01:13:20.169 --> 01:13:24.071
The remote is lie-proof, so you can't
change what already happened.

01:13:24.273 --> 01:13:26.207
But you're still a young man.

01:13:26.409 --> 01:13:29.071
A young, fat man.
You could win Donna back.

01:13:29.278 --> 01:13:31.337
So that's what I'll do.

01:13:31.547 --> 01:13:33.344
Go for it, tubs.

01:13:34.283 --> 01:13:38.686
I saw what you did to the duck.
Very good. Nice work.

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:56.365
You'll feel that in a second.

01:13:56.839 --> 01:14:00.138
All right, please,
please just read my note.

01:14:00.342 --> 01:14:03.106
- Hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

01:14:13.823 --> 01:14:15.984
Michael, are you awake?

01:14:17.326 --> 01:14:20.921
Michael, honey. Are you awake?

01:14:22.932 --> 01:14:24.832
Donna.

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:29.938
Where'd all my fat go?

01:14:32.608 --> 01:14:36.203
It was just a dream?
A terrible, terrible dream.

01:14:36.412 --> 01:14:38.437
What's that, Michael?
You had a bad dream?

01:14:38.647 --> 01:14:40.945
Did a fuzzy dog push me over?

01:14:42.852 --> 01:14:45.047
Oh, Shaggy the miracle dog?

01:14:45.254 --> 01:14:47.347
Yeah, if he hadn't knocked you
on your noggin...

01:14:47.556 --> 01:14:50.957
...you wouldn't have had the CAT scan
that found the cancer before it spread.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.593
I have cancer?

01:14:52.795 --> 01:14:54.626
No, you had cancer.

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:57.060
You're the only person
to gain weight during chemo.

01:14:57.266 --> 01:14:59.257
That's probably what caused
your heart attack.

01:14:59.468 --> 01:15:00.730
Heart attack?

01:15:00.936 --> 01:15:02.927
I thought they weaned you
off the morphine.

01:15:03.672 --> 01:15:05.299
Okay, Mr. Junk Food...

01:15:05.508 --> 01:15:08.102
...since the injury,
you haven't been healthy a full day.

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:10.676
When exactly did I hurt my head?

01:15:11.647 --> 01:15:15.014
When was it? Like, six years ago?

01:15:15.217 --> 01:15:20.587
Six more years! No! No!
It skipped all my sickness.

01:15:20.789 --> 01:15:22.757
I'm gonna ask them
to cut back on painkillers.

01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:24.516
Donna, don't go.

01:15:26.195 --> 01:15:27.856
What's this?

01:15:30.399 --> 01:15:34.426
That's not bad
for your third liposuction.

01:15:35.671 --> 01:15:37.536
One more tummy tuck
should take care of it.

01:15:38.607 --> 01:15:41.337
Oh, it looks like a tongue...

01:15:41.544 --> 01:15:43.136
...licking.

01:15:44.246 --> 01:15:47.704
Look, I should go.
Bill's waiting for me downstairs.

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:49.817
- So I'll probably...
- Bill?

01:15:50.019 --> 01:15:52.385
You're still with Speedo Torpedo?

01:15:52.588 --> 01:15:55.216
Whatever happened
to "forever and ever," honey?

01:15:55.424 --> 01:15:57.551
"Forever and ever"?

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.093
Look, Michael, I'm trying to have
a civilized relationship with you...

01:16:01.297 --> 01:16:02.628
...for the kids' sake.

01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:05.459
I really wanna be friends,
but I can't do that if you...

01:16:05.668 --> 01:16:07.329
Would you stop flapping that thing?

01:16:07.536 --> 01:16:10.300
It's my flap, I'll do
whatever the hell I want with it!

01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:13.232
You done?

01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:17.372
Look, Bill's my husband.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:20.378
Please learn to accept that.
I really have to go.

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:22.915
Husband? Donna?

01:16:23.118 --> 01:16:28.715
No. Donna. Donna. Donna!

01:16:29.291 --> 01:16:31.953
<i>Welcome to Newman Architecture.</i>

01:16:32.161 --> 01:16:34.789
<i>Building a better world for all of us.</i>

01:16:34.997 --> 01:16:37.158
<i>Architect of the year, 2018.</i>

01:16:37.366 --> 01:16:39.891
All your dreams came true,
huh, moron?

01:16:40.102 --> 01:16:42.935
Dad. Hey, how you feeling?

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.503
- Benjamin. Look at that.
- Look... What?

01:16:48.711 --> 01:16:52.875
Your face. Your skinny face.
You're shaving now, huh, kid?

01:16:53.082 --> 01:16:57.610
Your entire ass is gone.
What happened? Good for you.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:02.257
Right, my ass. Why don't
we talk about it in my office.

01:17:05.094 --> 01:17:07.255
My old office.

01:17:10.499 --> 01:17:13.696
The architect. How did this happen?

01:17:13.902 --> 01:17:17.963
- Mom said you were still a little loopy.
- No, no, no. I'm feeling terrific.

01:17:18.173 --> 01:17:21.768
The weight. How did you do it?
Staple treatment like your old man?

01:17:21.977 --> 01:17:24.036
Wanna have a flap fight?
You gotta see this...

01:17:24.246 --> 01:17:27.738
No. Just working out with Bill
five times a week. Same as always.

01:17:33.055 --> 01:17:38.357
That's a looker.
Blondie, big lips. Chesty.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.788
Is that your girl?

01:17:40.596 --> 01:17:42.621
No, that's your daughter Samantha.

01:17:43.065 --> 01:17:44.498
Of course it is.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:47.328
And you better
always take care of her...

01:17:47.536 --> 01:17:51.336
...and make sure nobody touches her
except you.

01:17:52.274 --> 01:17:55.402
Pop, I'm just getting ready
for this meeting.

01:17:56.812 --> 01:17:59.838
Okay. Absolutely.
I'll take off for you.

01:18:01.784 --> 01:18:05.652
I'd like to spend more time together.
All of us.

01:18:05.854 --> 01:18:07.913
Take you out for ice cream.
How's that?

01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:10.155
I know your mother won't come...

01:18:10.359 --> 01:18:14.489
...but you, Samantha,
Grandpa, Grandma.

01:18:14.897 --> 01:18:16.194
That'd be nice, huh?

01:18:17.833 --> 01:18:20.267
I knew something
was funny with you today.

01:18:20.469 --> 01:18:23.996
Papa, take a seat.
Let me get you a water, okay?

01:18:25.341 --> 01:18:27.468
What are we sitting for?

01:18:28.711 --> 01:18:32.647
- Here you go, Pop, drink this.
- All right. Drink some water.

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:36.447
There, I had my water.
What's going on?

01:18:39.755 --> 01:18:41.518
Grandpa died, Dad.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.890
He died a while back now.

01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:55.394
No, no, no.

01:18:55.604 --> 01:18:57.970
Don't say that.

01:18:58.774 --> 01:19:01.504
Where was I?

01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:03.007
You're crying?

01:19:04.113 --> 01:19:06.206
What happened?

01:19:07.249 --> 01:19:11.913
Nothing. You know,
he just got old. That's life.

01:19:12.121 --> 01:19:15.989
- Shit.
- You're born and you live and you die.

01:19:17.326 --> 01:19:18.623
Man, I gotta go.

01:19:18.827 --> 01:19:20.954
Hey, hang on.
Susie, push my next meeting.

01:19:21.163 --> 01:19:23.427
No, no, do your meeting.
It's fine. I'm just dizzy.

01:19:23.632 --> 01:19:26.362
- Why are you crying?
- I'm dizzy from the operation.

01:19:26.568 --> 01:19:30.231
- You're gonna make me cry, Dad.
- You don't... You don't have to go.

01:19:34.476 --> 01:19:36.740
You look... You look good.

01:19:36.945 --> 01:19:38.845
It's all right. Goodbye.

01:19:53.996 --> 01:19:55.657
Come on.

01:19:55.864 --> 01:19:57.195
Come on.

01:19:57.399 --> 01:19:59.458
It won't take you there.

01:20:00.002 --> 01:20:01.469
Take me where?

01:20:02.237 --> 01:20:05.070
To the moment he died.
You weren't there.

01:20:05.474 --> 01:20:07.533
Of course I wasn't.

01:20:09.278 --> 01:20:11.610
Can you take me
to the last time I saw him, please?

01:20:15.217 --> 01:20:18.744
Hey, Dad. Sorry to bug you.

01:20:18.954 --> 01:20:22.321
Would you mind looking
at my shopping mall design again?

01:20:22.524 --> 01:20:23.786
This one is cheaper.

01:20:23.992 --> 01:20:27.018
But if you check this out...

01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:30.255
...you'll see it has
a much better natural flow...

01:20:30.466 --> 01:20:33.492
Cheaper one, like I said.
Now, just let me do my e-mail.

01:20:35.471 --> 01:20:37.564
Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Dad.

01:20:37.773 --> 01:20:40.742
He ain't right. You're a schmuck!
Look at it!

01:20:41.276 --> 01:20:42.265
Surprise.

01:20:42.478 --> 01:20:44.810
Hey, Grandpa.

01:20:45.247 --> 01:20:47.772
Oh, my God.

01:20:51.587 --> 01:20:54.078
When did you get so handsome?

01:20:54.289 --> 01:20:56.689
So, Michael, I had a wonderful idea.

01:20:56.892 --> 01:20:59.292
Your mother's playing canasta
with her friends tonight.

01:20:59.495 --> 01:21:01.861
I thought,
"What a great opportunity."

01:21:02.064 --> 01:21:05.124
You, me and Ben should go
and have a boys' night out.

01:21:05.334 --> 01:21:07.768
- Can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:09.130
You have to eat sometime.

01:21:09.338 --> 01:21:11.738
We could go,
we could whistle at pretty girls.

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:14.204
- I'm down for that.
- See? He's down.

01:21:14.409 --> 01:21:16.468
I don't know what it means,
but he's down.

01:21:16.678 --> 01:21:20.114
- Hey. Please.
- Don't give me that finger.

01:21:25.153 --> 01:21:27.280
I'll make you a deal.

01:21:27.489 --> 01:21:31.823
If you come, I'll show you
the quarter trick.

01:21:32.027 --> 01:21:34.393
- Will you look at the man?
- I'll tell you the secret.

01:21:34.596 --> 01:21:36.496
No, Dad.

01:21:36.698 --> 01:21:37.960
Don't you wanna know how l...?

01:21:38.166 --> 01:21:40.634
I know how you do the stupid trick.
I've always known.

01:21:40.836 --> 01:21:42.133
Can you let me do my work?

01:21:46.708 --> 01:21:48.369
You've always known.

01:21:48.577 --> 01:21:50.044
You're pathetic.

01:21:51.046 --> 01:21:52.570
Okay.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:57.810
I'm so sorry I barged in.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:00.313
I love you, son.

01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:04.990
See you later, Grandpa, I love you.

01:22:05.193 --> 01:22:06.785
Dad.

01:22:07.462 --> 01:22:09.225
Pop.

01:22:09.431 --> 01:22:11.126
Pop.

01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:37.249
I love you, son.

01:22:41.263 --> 01:22:43.322
I love you, son.

01:22:45.033 --> 01:22:47.058
I love you, son.

01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:55.236
I love you too, Dad.

01:23:00.515 --> 01:23:02.312
I'll miss you.

01:23:04.686 --> 01:23:06.051
You know that.

01:23:09.725 --> 01:23:11.386
Goodbye.

01:23:37.219 --> 01:23:39.585
I'm sorry about your father.

01:23:40.022 --> 01:23:43.981
Taking him wasn't something
I wanted to do.

01:23:44.726 --> 01:23:46.159
What do you mean "taking him"?

01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:47.953
I'm an angel, Michael.

01:23:48.497 --> 01:23:50.158
An angel?

01:23:51.066 --> 01:23:53.591
I thought an angel was
supposed to protect people.

01:23:53.802 --> 01:23:55.861
I'm the angel of death.

01:23:57.806 --> 01:24:00.604
Your dad, it was his time.

01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:04.178
You bastard.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.785
All right, leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

01:24:13.989 --> 01:24:17.447
You had your fun.
Just take me to a good place.

01:24:33.442 --> 01:24:38.038
And now, everybody, it's time
for Mr. Newman to say a few words.

01:24:38.647 --> 01:24:40.205
Yay, Michael!

01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:45.014
Go get them, Michael! Speech!

01:24:47.823 --> 01:24:50.314
Wedding cake. Wedding cake.

01:24:51.093 --> 01:24:53.891
Okay, where's the groom?
Show your face.

01:24:54.096 --> 01:24:55.688
Hi, Dad.

01:24:56.398 --> 01:25:00.027
Ben. I didn't miss
my son's wedding.

01:25:00.235 --> 01:25:04.672
Wow, this is terrific, buddy.
Who's the lucky lady?

01:25:05.307 --> 01:25:07.901
Very funny, Mr. Newman.

01:25:10.779 --> 01:25:12.246
Aunt Peggy, is that you?

01:25:13.815 --> 01:25:15.749
God, you got old.

01:25:17.719 --> 01:25:23.055
No, no. L... She... I'm just playing.
She knows that.

01:25:28.897 --> 01:25:30.194
Ma.

01:25:34.302 --> 01:25:36.702
Ben's wife...

01:25:37.339 --> 01:25:38.601
...welcome to the family.

01:25:38.807 --> 01:25:39.967
Thank you.

01:25:40.175 --> 01:25:42.973
Congratulations.
Let's have the best night, okay?

01:25:52.954 --> 01:25:57.550
Look at you, Ma. You look amazing.

01:25:59.227 --> 01:26:02.890
Michael, you haven't kissed me
like that since you were a little boy.

01:26:03.098 --> 01:26:06.431
You are the best, Ma.
You know I know that, right?

01:26:06.635 --> 01:26:09.798
Oh, darling, that's so sweet.

01:26:10.472 --> 01:26:14.272
You know, Michael, your father
would've loved to be here.

01:26:14.476 --> 01:26:15.943
I know, Ma.

01:26:16.812 --> 01:26:19.838
Okay? I'm just glad you're here.

01:26:20.615 --> 01:26:25.985
Me too, bubbala. Me too. Me too.
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

01:26:26.454 --> 01:26:27.819
Beautiful. Look at her.

01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:30.481
Donna, my favorite.

01:26:31.326 --> 01:26:33.658
You're such a schmuck
for letting her go.

01:26:33.862 --> 01:26:36.956
But don't let me ruin your evening.
I'll talk to you later.

01:26:37.165 --> 01:26:39.133
Christina.

01:26:41.937 --> 01:26:44.770
Michael, you've been so generous
taking care of all this...

01:26:44.973 --> 01:26:46.133
...and the kids' honeymoon.

01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:48.434
- Absolutely.
- Thank you so much.

01:26:48.643 --> 01:26:52.841
Of course. Ben's wife
seems like a nice kid, huh?

01:26:53.048 --> 01:26:55.983
- I think she's wonderful.
- Definite keeper.

01:26:56.184 --> 01:26:59.711
Here's one you might remember
from The Cranberries.

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:07.654
Out of all the songs, huh?

01:27:09.297 --> 01:27:11.231
Bill, since it's our son's wedding...

01:27:11.433 --> 01:27:14.334
...do you mind if I dance
with my ex-husband for a minute?

01:27:14.536 --> 01:27:16.800
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

01:27:17.005 --> 01:27:19.565
Just have her back by midnight,
all right, champ?

01:27:19.774 --> 01:27:20.968
You got it, Bill.

01:27:33.221 --> 01:27:35.587
Why does he have
a bathing suit on?

01:27:37.292 --> 01:27:39.453
Nice Speedo, buddy.

01:27:51.473 --> 01:27:53.338
Still smelling good, huh?

01:27:53.541 --> 01:27:56.032
After all these years.

01:27:57.746 --> 01:27:59.213
Are you happy?

01:27:59.414 --> 01:28:02.144
Of course I'm happy,
our son just got married.

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:07.014
Not about that. Are you happy
about where our lives ended up?

01:28:07.222 --> 01:28:10.089
"Ended." It's not over yet.

01:28:10.292 --> 01:28:13.955
- That's my Donna.
- It's true.

01:28:15.463 --> 01:28:17.090
That Samantha?

01:28:17.699 --> 01:28:22.033
Hey. What are you doing?
Put a sweater on. Cover them up.

01:28:23.038 --> 01:28:24.437
What is with you?

01:28:26.408 --> 01:28:28.273
Just kidding, I...

01:28:28.476 --> 01:28:31.309
Just not used to seeing you
all grown-up like this.

01:28:32.314 --> 01:28:37.251
Okay, well, if that's your way of telling
me that I look pretty, then thank you.

01:28:37.786 --> 01:28:39.219
Let's go get some cake.

01:28:39.421 --> 01:28:41.321
- I'll race you there, Dad. Come on.
- Okay.

01:28:43.024 --> 01:28:44.651
"Dad"?

01:28:47.162 --> 01:28:48.459
Michael, are you okay?

01:28:51.066 --> 01:28:54.593
Is there a doctor?
We need a doctor here!

01:28:57.706 --> 01:28:59.003
Michael!

01:28:59.207 --> 01:29:01.971
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:29:03.979 --> 01:29:05.674
It's just corn flakes.

01:29:31.006 --> 01:29:33.770
One dance, you pop an artery.

01:29:35.043 --> 01:29:39.173
Why'd you make me
waste my entire life?

01:29:39.381 --> 01:29:41.474
You were fast-forwarding
through your life...

01:29:41.683 --> 01:29:44.049
...long before you ever met me.

01:29:44.252 --> 01:29:46.311
You lived the life you chose,
big shot.

01:29:47.188 --> 01:29:49.281
This is not the life I wanted.

01:29:49.491 --> 01:29:50.890
It is.

01:29:56.131 --> 01:29:57.325
Looks like it is.

01:30:01.202 --> 01:30:04.330
Hey. You're up. How you feeling?

01:30:06.274 --> 01:30:09.209
I feel better
now that you guys are here.

01:30:09.411 --> 01:30:11.675
Samantha's been here
like 36 hours straight.

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.247
She said she wouldn't leave
the hospital until you woke up.

01:30:16.217 --> 01:30:20.244
- Why'd you do that?
- Because. You're my father.

01:30:20.855 --> 01:30:23.323
I thought Bill was your father.

01:30:24.059 --> 01:30:26.186
I have two fathers.

01:30:27.162 --> 01:30:31.826
One of them told me he was gonna
live till he was 200. Remember?

01:30:33.735 --> 01:30:36.169
You both really need
to get some sleep.

01:30:36.371 --> 01:30:38.566
And I got a plane to catch.

01:30:39.307 --> 01:30:42.003
Big Ben's gotta go
on his honeymoon.

01:30:42.677 --> 01:30:45.271
Actually, I just canceled
the honeymoon.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.348
Kensington deal might fall through,
so I gotta go do damage control.

01:30:49.551 --> 01:30:51.348
- Julie and I can go to Italy anytime.
- No.

01:30:51.553 --> 01:30:52.781
It's not that big a deal.

01:30:52.987 --> 01:30:55.217
- That's not fair to your wife.
- Dad...

01:30:55.423 --> 01:30:58.358
...she gets it. Keeping
the business going is more important.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.324
Guys, I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to leave. He needs his rest.

01:31:01.529 --> 01:31:02.689
All right. Bye, Dad.

01:31:03.998 --> 01:31:05.761
Bye, Daddy.

01:31:17.212 --> 01:31:18.975
Get this off of me.

01:31:23.518 --> 01:31:25.247
Whoa, whoa!

01:31:25.453 --> 01:31:27.978
Hey, fella, you're a long way
from walking out of here.

01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:29.656
I gotta see my son.

01:31:29.858 --> 01:31:32.258
You're not going anywhere.
Now, get back into the bed.

01:31:33.027 --> 01:31:35.086
- Isn't that Colin Farrell?
- Where?

01:31:41.169 --> 01:31:42.534
Michael.

01:31:42.737 --> 01:31:46.173
Those machines
are keeping you alive.

01:31:46.374 --> 01:31:48.842
I gotta talk to my boy.

01:31:55.783 --> 01:31:58.013
- Michael, stop.
- No.

01:32:00.755 --> 01:32:03.747
Michael, it doesn't have to end now.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.334
Ben!

01:32:26.481 --> 01:32:27.675
Ben!

01:32:36.424 --> 01:32:39.222
Ben!

01:32:41.162 --> 01:32:44.563
Ben!

01:32:47.101 --> 01:32:49.160
Dad? Dad?

01:32:49.737 --> 01:32:51.728
Dad, what are you doing?

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.067
Are you okay?

01:32:54.776 --> 01:32:58.337
- Oh, my God.
- Help! Help!

01:32:58.546 --> 01:33:00.537
- Dad! Dad!
- Help!

01:33:00.748 --> 01:33:02.306
Ben, Ben.

01:33:06.387 --> 01:33:09.151
Family. Family. Family.

01:33:09.357 --> 01:33:10.415
What?

01:33:10.625 --> 01:33:14.994
Family. Family. Family comes first.

01:33:15.563 --> 01:33:17.258
Family comes first.

01:33:17.465 --> 01:33:19.592
Honeymoon. Honeymoon.

01:33:20.068 --> 01:33:23.231
Honeymoon. I love you.

01:33:25.039 --> 01:33:27.564
Samantha. Samantha.

01:33:27.775 --> 01:33:32.075
I didn't make 200, but I love you.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.111
I love you.

01:33:34.849 --> 01:33:37.943
Bill, Bill, Bill.

01:34:03.478 --> 01:34:05.469
I'm sorry.

01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:10.717
Michael.

01:34:10.918 --> 01:34:15.082
The note you wrote her,
it's in your pocket.

01:34:29.504 --> 01:34:32.166
Forever and ever, babe.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.347
It's time to go.

01:35:15.383 --> 01:35:19.479
- Where am I?
- You're in Bed Bath & Beyond, sir.

01:35:19.687 --> 01:35:21.177
I was just watching you sleep.

01:35:21.389 --> 01:35:23.789
You looked like you were having
a crazy dream.

01:35:23.991 --> 01:35:24.958
What?

01:35:25.159 --> 01:35:28.822
You're not supposed to lay
in the beds, but I do sometimes.

01:35:31.799 --> 01:35:33.994
I'm back in the store?

01:35:37.538 --> 01:35:41.030
I'm young again. I'm young again.

01:35:41.242 --> 01:35:43.210
Well, I mean,
you're not "young" young.

01:35:43.411 --> 01:35:45.242
I'm young.
You're kind of on the back nine.

01:35:45.446 --> 01:35:48.745
No, no. No. I'm just teeing off, baby.

01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:50.383
Look at you.

01:35:50.585 --> 01:35:54.248
You want a friend? You want a friend?
I'll be your friend, baby.

01:35:54.455 --> 01:35:57.049
I'll be your friend. I'll be your...

01:35:58.426 --> 01:36:00.792
Oh, my God!

01:36:04.298 --> 01:36:06.823
Yes, my crappy car!

01:36:07.034 --> 01:36:10.401
You mediocre, middle-class
piece of shit!

01:36:10.605 --> 01:36:12.368
I love you!

01:36:21.549 --> 01:36:25.417
Pop, Pop. Pop.
There he is. There he is.

01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:27.815
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Nothing's wrong.

01:36:28.022 --> 01:36:30.957
Everything's incredible, Ma.
I just wanted to tell you I love you.

01:36:31.159 --> 01:36:32.683
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

01:36:32.894 --> 01:36:36.193
You gotta tell me how you do
the quarter trick, it's driving me crazy.

01:36:36.397 --> 01:36:38.126
A magician never reveals
his secrets.

01:36:38.332 --> 01:36:40.800
However, if you invite us over
for dinner more...

01:36:41.002 --> 01:36:44.460
You come over tomorrow night, and
the night after that. Any time you want.

01:36:44.672 --> 01:36:47.664
- Stop, I'm gonna have a heart attack.
- No, I have the heart attacks.

01:36:47.875 --> 01:36:50.708
Thank you so much for giving
birth to me, I know it hurt. Okay?

01:36:50.912 --> 01:36:54.370
You have no idea. But, honey, please,
stay off the bong pipe.

01:36:54.582 --> 01:36:56.743
I can't promise you that.

01:36:58.386 --> 01:37:02.049
Okay. I'm up.

01:37:02.256 --> 01:37:04.019
What do you think?

01:37:05.226 --> 01:37:07.922
If you massage me first.

01:37:08.129 --> 01:37:10.222
Okay, let's go to sleep.

01:37:26.447 --> 01:37:30.508
Mom, wake up!
There's a crazy noise downstairs.

01:37:34.455 --> 01:37:35.683
What the heck is going on?

01:37:36.157 --> 01:37:38.455
Hey, do you mind?
I am trying to concentrate.

01:37:38.659 --> 01:37:40.388
Here I am, staying up all night...

01:37:40.595 --> 01:37:43.996
...trying to come up with activities
for our Fourth of July camping trip...

01:37:44.198 --> 01:37:45.495
...but you won't let me think!

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:49.796
You want time to think? Why don't you
think about the fact that you just wo...

01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:53.666
What did you just say?

01:37:53.875 --> 01:37:56.708
Yes, you heard me.
If you keep up this weird attitude...

01:37:56.911 --> 01:38:00.108
...I won't be able to work for a year
and have to plan 10 more vacations.

01:38:00.314 --> 01:38:02.942
- That make you happy?
- Did you eat a bad Yodel?

01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:04.174
Give me those big lips.

01:38:06.454 --> 01:38:09.287
- What's going on down here?
- Ben. Ben!

01:38:09.490 --> 01:38:10.855
Come here. Oh, my God.

01:38:11.058 --> 01:38:13.492
I missed you, I missed you.
Look at you, boy.

01:38:13.694 --> 01:38:16.754
I'm gonna finish the tree house.
We're gonna sleep in it next weekend.

01:38:16.964 --> 01:38:19.933
From now on, we're gonna exercise
and I'm not gonna wear a Speedo.

01:38:20.134 --> 01:38:21.158
- All right!
- All right.

01:38:21.369 --> 01:38:24.702
And you. Nice jump! I love you.

01:38:24.906 --> 01:38:27.636
One day, you are gonna be
the hottest chick alive.

01:38:27.842 --> 01:38:29.241
But you still gotta have brains.

01:38:29.443 --> 01:38:31.343
So tomorrow I'm gonna
teach you calculus.

01:38:31.546 --> 01:38:32.740
You know calculus?

01:38:32.947 --> 01:38:35.313
I knew you'd call me on that.
Your mom will teach you.

01:38:35.516 --> 01:38:38.246
Now, get your rest, because tomorrow
we're going camping!

01:38:38.452 --> 01:38:40.181
I know! It's gonna be the best!

01:38:40.388 --> 01:38:43.016
- Put a sweater on! Don't take it off!
- Okay, Daddy.

01:38:43.224 --> 01:38:44.748
Oh, and Sundance!

01:38:44.959 --> 01:38:49.362
Doggie years go by very quick,
so it's time to enjoy the real thing.

01:38:51.332 --> 01:38:53.596
Yeah, go get some, baby.

01:39:08.649 --> 01:39:11.618
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:39:12.954 --> 01:39:15.923
No. Go to Sundance, not the duck.

01:39:21.395 --> 01:39:23.386
They told me at the pet store
it was a female.

01:39:23.598 --> 01:39:24.963
They lied to me, I guess.

01:39:27.234 --> 01:39:30.431
- You staying downstairs tonight?
- Why? That's getting you going?

01:39:31.539 --> 01:39:35.532
It's Fourth of July,
I'm gonna celebrate with my wife.

01:39:35.743 --> 01:39:40.237
Take my time, massage her,
make sure she is fully satisfied.

01:39:40.448 --> 01:39:44.384
But you know, it isn't
the Fourth of July, it's only the second.

01:39:44.585 --> 01:39:48.077
That's even better.
Happy second of July, honey.

01:39:48.289 --> 01:39:50.086
- Think I like this holiday.
- Yeah?

01:39:50.291 --> 01:39:52.759
I'm gonna go change
into my Pocahontas costume.

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.760
- I'll see you upstairs.
- I'll bring the duck.

01:39:56.964 --> 01:40:00.764
Okay, I gotta call my dad
and tell him to get the old tent ready.

01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:26.021
"Like I said,
'Good guys need a break.'

01:40:26.794 --> 01:40:30.025
I know you'll do
the right thing this time.

01:40:30.231 --> 01:40:32.699
Love, Morty.

01:40:33.167 --> 01:40:34.532
P. S:

01:40:34.735 --> 01:40:38.466
Your wife's rocking body
still drives me crazy."

01:40:39.173 --> 01:40:41.300
Okay, Morty.

01:41:04.465 --> 01:41:06.990
Hey, who wants
to have a pillow fight?

01:41:07.305 --> 01:41:13.862
