WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.803
- Dad, we actually need
to talk to you about

00:02.903 --> 00:04.838
hitting on all the customers.
- I didn't hit on anybody.

00:04.938 --> 00:07.375
It was just one, two ladies?

00:07.475 --> 00:08.776
Okay.
- Yeah.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.844
- Let me ask ya, have you ever
considered a haircut?

00:13.547 --> 00:14.748
- Every girl
who went out with me

00:14.848 --> 00:16.550
did it because of my hair.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.019
That's it.
They're all into long hair.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.090
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.758
- Dad, put on some underwear
for  sake.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.859
Crack kills.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.099
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:31.199 --> 00:33.467
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:33.567 --> 00:34.968
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:35.069 --> 00:36.970
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.306
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.640
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:39.740 --> 00:41.342
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:41.442 --> 00:42.876
- You shut your face.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.045
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.214
- We're back, baby!

00:49.850 --> 00:51.785
- So, we're going back
to West Covina today.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.487
We had really good luck
here last time,

00:53.587 --> 00:55.356
one of our best units
in a while.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.458
- I know.
- So, I feel like today,

00:57.558 --> 00:59.093
like, the gloves are off.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.394
We'll have a good time.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.663
- Get the fun up.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.533
- Get all done up
and get the fun up.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.534
- There you go.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.935
- I'm feeling good today.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.270
I'm gonna use this good

01:09.370 --> 01:11.839
to get some good...units.

01:11.939 --> 01:15.476
- That is a good attitude
to have, Jarrod.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.010
Who's that lady?

01:17.111 --> 01:18.279
*

01:18.379 --> 01:20.881
- Damn, look at her.
She's got some miles on her.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.353
Oh...they're a pain in my ass.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.587
I can't stand them.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.189
- They look like
they have money, don't they?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.223
- They don't have money.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.159
They just act like they do.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.993
- I guess I should grab
my money this time, huh?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.828
- Maybe.
- Good morning!

01:34.928 --> 01:37.231
- Hello, I'm Gunter.
- Hi. Emily. Nice to meet you.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.532
- Nice to meet you too.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.967
I wanna stand next to you.
Can I stand next to you?

01:40.067 --> 01:41.169
- Oh, sure, yes.
I love your hair.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.770
- All right. This is--

01:42.870 --> 01:44.071
- Oh, stop it!

01:44.172 --> 01:45.839
- Oh, I love it.
It's like Fabio.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.275
- Thank you, thank you.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.742
- Dad, when we go
to an auction,

01:48.842 --> 01:50.077
we're not friends
with the people.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.445
We're not here to make
connections or friends.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.813
- Gunter!

01:52.913 --> 01:54.848
- Hello.
- Hey.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.951
- Dad, every time
he gets a good locker

01:58.051 --> 01:58.952
that he outbids me for,

01:59.052 --> 02:00.421
he's taking food
out of my mouth.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.323
- He likes me.
- No, he does not.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.158
- I like it when Gunter
comes to auctions.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.761
He always convinces Rene
to buy bad lockers.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.730
- Oh, look, my favorite
people in the world.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.832
- You guys look like
two lost dogs.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.966
- Thank you!

02:13.066 --> 02:15.636
- Look at those
oddly fitting jeans.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.773
*

02:19.873 --> 02:21.242
- I'm good.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.676
- I'm Gunter.
Very nice to meet you.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.144
- Nice to meet you too.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.214
You look like one of
my mom's ex-boyfriends.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.281
- Mm-hmm.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.116
- Your mom has
really good taste.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.651
- Ha!

02:30.751 --> 02:32.186
Might be your mom's
next boyfriend.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.554
- It could be.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.489
- I need to meet her.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.326
- Oh, boy.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.294
- So, is that natural
or is that, like, a perm?

02:40.394 --> 02:42.596
- No, I don't do nothing.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.565
- Would you like
to pull my hair?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.267
- Um...we're gonna
have to wait for

02:46.367 --> 02:48.135
the second date
for that, Gunter.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.337
- Okay, okay.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.738
- Good afternoon, everyone!

02:50.838 --> 02:52.806
Thank you for coming out today
to West Covina

02:52.906 --> 02:53.974
and My Self Storage.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.042
Once I open the door,
you can't go in

02:55.142 --> 02:56.310
and you can't touch anything,

02:56.410 --> 02:57.645
but you will all
get a chance to look.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.613
And if you guys are ready
to see the units, so am I.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.714
Let's go!

03:00.814 --> 03:03.317
*

03:03.417 --> 03:05.853
All righty, guys,
first unit's a 5-by-10.

03:05.953 --> 03:06.987
*

03:07.087 --> 03:08.489
Here we go!

03:08.589 --> 03:10.658
- Whoa...

03:10.758 --> 03:12.893
*

03:12.993 --> 03:13.961
- Ooh...

03:14.061 --> 03:14.995
- If this is an
entertainment center,

03:15.095 --> 03:16.530
it has to go
straight to the trash.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.698
There's a dining set
back there,

03:17.798 --> 03:18.866
but the chairs are wide.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.268
You can see, they're all dirty.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.270
- Old furniture, pressed wood.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.438
- That's garbage. It's all
pressed wood furniture.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.706
Yeah, we're not buying this.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.141
- Stupid wall units
that nobody ever buys.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.378
Some pressed wood furniture.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.179
Uh-uh.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.382
I see everything.
- Nothing.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.950
- Chairs, dinette set.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.086
Nice American flag.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.821
Best one of the day.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.222
- There's nothing in it
except pressed word furniture.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.223
It's garbage.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.095
*

03:48.195 --> 03:50.798
- I'm fine.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.301
- No, he--he didn't take--
he doesn't take his medication.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.468
- Oh.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.604
- All righty, guys,
lots of furniture.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.439
--100--

03:58.539 --> 04:00.374
$100--$50--

04:00.474 --> 04:01.975
- 25!

04:02.075 --> 04:03.644
--25--
- 30.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.415
35--

04:07.515 --> 04:08.616
35--40--40.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.751
35--40--

04:10.851 --> 04:12.085
- S--

04:12.185 --> 04:13.954
with me?

04:14.054 --> 04:16.390
--

04:16.490 --> 04:18.826
45 and 50--50--45--

04:20.193 --> 04:22.062
Darryl got it for 45.
- Oh!

04:22.162 --> 04:23.897
- Well, that was easy.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.834
I can already see triple
my money on this unit.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.303
- Here we go!
Second unit of the day.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.538
- He doesn't even
look like you.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.172
- Is he supposed
to look like me?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.507
- Well, he's your son.
- Yeah.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.942
- Or maybe not. I don't know.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.510
Hold on, I gotta see something.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.778
Mm, nope, I don't see it.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.246
I don't think he was yours.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.014
- Mm-mm, nope.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.416
- Then I could start
all over again.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.517
- You could start
all over again.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.519
- Yeah.
- Get yourself a nice kid.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.855
- Yeah.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.558
*

04:50.658 --> 04:53.260
- Oh...

04:53.361 --> 04:57.965
*

04:58.065 --> 04:59.833
- It's nice.
- The oil is great.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.135
The tank is drained.
That's a good sign.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.071
- Keys. We've got the keys.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.839
- Everything that we can see

05:05.939 --> 05:07.708
is perfect.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.443
- Yeah,
like that's gonna start.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.845
- Yeah.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.313
*

05:14.415 --> 05:16.484
- Battery, a little rusty,

05:16.584 --> 05:18.619
so I'm sure it's been
sitting here for a while.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.020
- Well...

05:20.120 --> 05:21.689
- All righty, guys, we're just
selling this as parts.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.724
I don't know anything about
its running condition.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.593
- Does it have
title, paperwork?

05:25.693 --> 05:26.860
- Not that I know of.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.295
- This might actually be
the best deal of the day.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.463
- All righty, here we go, guys.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.198
You're buying the ATV
for parts only.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.166
And how 'bout 100--
--

05:33.266 --> 05:34.502
- Yeah.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.903
--
- Yeah.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.005
--

05:38.105 --> 05:39.740
300--350--300--

05:39.840 --> 05:42.910
400--

05:43.010 --> 05:44.678
450--

05:44.778 --> 05:47.047
500--

05:47.147 --> 05:49.683
450--500. 450 and 500...

05:49.783 --> 05:51.919
Sold it to you.
Rene got it for 450.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.253
- Very nice!

05:53.353 --> 05:56.123
- $450 for this ATV
was a steal.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.025
Maybe my dad is good luck.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.393
*

05:59.493 --> 06:00.561
Nah.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.663
- Right this way, guys,
down the hall!

06:02.763 --> 06:05.032
- If we get this running, that
was the best deal of the day.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.435
- Okay, but we need
to check it out first.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.269
We've got the keys.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.472
No. Battery?

06:11.572 --> 06:12.906
Oh, it's not connected!

06:13.006 --> 06:14.207
- That means whenever
they put it in,

06:14.307 --> 06:17.545
they cared about it.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.012
t it.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.681
Okay, now try the key.

06:20.781 --> 06:21.915
- Come on!

06:22.015 --> 06:23.751
*

06:23.851 --> 06:25.919
- That's green.
- Ahh!

06:26.019 --> 06:28.288
Look, starter works,
but it's too weak.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.723
Hear it?
- Yeah.

06:31.825 --> 06:35.796
- It's a 2006 TRX 250EX.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.698
Okay, try the headlights.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.533
Yeah, there you go.
- High beams.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.134
- That's a good sign.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.437
But it's missing
all the paperwork.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.039
- Maybe we should have somebody
who really knows check it out.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.375
- All right. Let me show you
how to ride an ATV.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.077
- Okay.
- You hit the corners...

06:50.177 --> 06:52.245
Ahh! Then you come back,
you go over!

06:52.345 --> 06:53.614
It's going, and,
oh, we gotta jump!

06:53.714 --> 06:55.983
Whoo!

06:56.083 --> 07:00.387
*

07:00.488 --> 07:02.422
- Let's go!
- Rock and roll.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.457
*

07:03.557 --> 07:04.958
- Whoa...

07:05.058 --> 07:06.259
- Whoo!

07:06.359 --> 07:08.261
*

07:08.361 --> 07:09.497
- A lot of boxes.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.231
Walkers.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.399
Looks like they're might be
PlayStation.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.167
- There is a lot of
stuff in there.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.703
I think this is the one.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.638
- Christmas stuff...

07:17.738 --> 07:18.939
There's some boxes of dishes.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.509
Little propane things.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.110
It's all beat up
and all scratched up.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.712
This ain't for me.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.413
- I like this unit.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.781
Shower chair.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.884
Shovel, so if I have to
bury you in the backyard.

07:30.984 --> 07:31.985
*

07:32.085 --> 07:32.986
- There's a lot of
stuff in there.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.522
I think we should bid on this.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.423
- There's my wine glass
right there.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.725
- Sangria.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.260
You ever made your own Sangria?
- I--I have.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.096
I have a--I have a scar
I call Sangria.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.932
- You must have fall down
and gone boom-boom!

07:45.032 --> 07:45.933
- I did.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.267
- All righty, guys, here we go!

07:47.367 --> 07:48.536
Nice Sangria glass.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.403
This looks like
a Saturday night here.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.339
- 50.
- Saturday night unit.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.141
- 75--100--
- If you're lonely.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.209
- 100--100--125--
--

07:56.309 --> 07:57.477
- Yeah.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.347

08:00.447 --> 08:02.182
175--

08:02.282 --> 08:03.183
- Yeah!

08:03.283 --> 08:05.018

08:05.118 --> 08:07.387
300--

08:07.487 --> 08:08.589
- Yeah.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.124
--
400

08:11.224 --> 08:14.194
450. Now 500--500--550.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.564
550--

08:16.664 --> 08:18.098
600 now--650--
Gonna make it 650.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.201
Anybody else wanna do 625

08:21.301 --> 08:22.836
Sold it to ya. $600...
- Whoo!

08:22.936 --> 08:24.504
- Jarrod and Brandi
got it for 600.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.473
- We got
the Saturday night unit,

08:26.574 --> 08:28.909
and now it's time to party.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.578
- That's gonna do it.
Thanks for coming out today.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.145
Make sure you come and find me
to pay your bills

08:32.245 --> 08:33.446
before you start loading.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.748
See ya next time!

08:34.848 --> 08:37.050
- Dad, they got
all the paperwork in there.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.452
- I'm getting a title.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.856
And that's why it always pays
to do your homework, kids.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.692
Double's the value, buddy!

08:44.792 --> 08:46.026
*

08:46.126 --> 08:48.228
- Work smart:
That's what I'm doing.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.763
Work smart, not hard.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.431
I don't like to work hard,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.867
but that's the quality
of any stable genius.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.537
This is a really, really nice
entertainment center.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.872
It's cherry wood.

08:58.972 --> 09:02.442
This is an easy $500 bill
for me right here.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.611
Nice clock.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.279
That's an easy $10 right there.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.949
Somebody bought
really, really good stuff.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.586
I'll get 100 bucks apiece
on these nightstands.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.656
Nice little antique right here.

09:15.756 --> 09:19.092
That's a $50 bill
all day long right there.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.528
This is a cedar chest
right here.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.564
*

09:24.665 --> 09:27.367
Well, how nice would it be
for 45 bucks

09:27.467 --> 09:31.371
to turn this thing into
a ton of jewelry or something?

09:31.471 --> 09:32.973
Oh...ooh...

09:33.073 --> 09:35.976
This is an old Storybook doll,

09:36.076 --> 09:38.646
with the certificate
and everything in here.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.514
She's at least 30 bucks
right there.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.316
This must be another doll.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.186
Yep, another 20 bucks
right there.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.690
Just the cedar box alone
is worth 100 bucks.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.158
Dining room set.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.927
I've got the table over there,
and here's the other base.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.329
That thing's gonna bring
at least 600 bucks.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.198
It's solid mahogany.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.735
Nice little rolling
kitchen cabinet right here.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.270
I'd get 80 bucks for that.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.906
Here's the long dresser
to go with those nightstands.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.075
I'll get 200 bucks for that.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.542
Here's a nice little
baker's rack.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.444
I'll get 40 bucks for that.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.914
I've got this big
living room buffet.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.149
That's probably 200 bucks.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.485
I can't believe no one else
wanted this locker.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.921
It is crapping cash.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.823
Let's see if I can
get in this thing.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.158
*

10:25.258 --> 10:26.727
Oh, yeah!

10:26.827 --> 10:28.261
There's a safe.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.596
*

10:29.697 --> 10:31.498
What the heck?

10:31.598 --> 10:34.702
*

10:34.802 --> 10:37.270
There's something in this safe.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.041
Hmm.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.043
I've never seen
anything like it.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.078
*

10:46.379 --> 10:49.049
I hear something
rattling around in here.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.718
*

10:56.656 --> 11:03.764
*

11:10.904 --> 11:12.039
Yes!

11:12.139 --> 11:14.174
*

11:14.274 --> 11:15.508
What the heck?

11:15.608 --> 11:16.543
*

11:16.643 --> 11:21.414
Oh...yeah...

11:21.514 --> 11:24.017
Wow, this might be
something right here.

11:24.117 --> 11:27.020
This looks like
it's an aquamarine,

11:27.120 --> 11:29.389
and this looks like a ruby.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.924
I mean, if that's a real ruby,

11:31.024 --> 11:33.593
that thing could be worth
thousands of dollars.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.329
Oh, yeah!

11:36.429 --> 11:38.465
And here's a little
tiny diamond.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.601
This right here could be
the return of the Wow Factor.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.704
*

11:44.805 --> 11:46.273
- Come on, Vanna.
- Oh.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.474
- Roll it.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.942
*

11:49.042 --> 11:50.878
- Eat your heart out,
Pat Sajak.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.345
- Oh, yeah!

11:53.814 --> 11:55.749
- Oh--
- Heat lamp.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.584
That's a heat lamp.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.653
- 25 bucks.
- We're rich!

12:00.754 --> 12:03.123
Mixer.
- That's a good mixer.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.324
40 bucks for that.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.093
Brandi,
purple chair coming out.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.161
I need help.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.329
- I don't know,
there's something

12:09.429 --> 12:11.098
holding this thing in place.
- Hold on.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.365
It's a paddle.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.367
- Get the paddle!
- I'm gonna get the paddle.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.970
- You are if you keep it up.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.739
Ooh, look at that.
- This is rad.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.575
- Is that for, uh...

12:22.675 --> 12:25.378
- Cricket. That's what I'm
trying to think of, cricket.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.314
There's more.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.481
- Ooh...

12:28.581 --> 12:30.117
- Whoa!

12:30.217 --> 12:31.885
Don't hit 'em.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.454
Don't hit 'em. This could be
the money in this unit.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.090
You get this, and I'll
try to catch that thing.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.558
- Sounds tricky.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.427
.
You got it?

12:40.527 --> 12:42.229
Okay, okay.
- Okay. Yeah, okay.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.530
- Okay.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.133
- Some people are helpful,
and some people are Brandi.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.400
Straight to the ground.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.803
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:49.903 --> 12:51.571
Whoa!

12:51.671 --> 12:53.640
We're good! Everybody's good.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.542
This thing's nice.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.944
- We'll sell that
for 100 bucks.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.546
- This dresser right here
looks nice, babe.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.882
This is probably 150 bucks.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.316
Q-tips, coming out!

13:03.416 --> 13:04.717
Next!

13:06.719 --> 13:09.289
DVDs,
and they're good ones.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.158
50?
- 50 bucks. Let's go.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.559
- All right.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.861
- By the way, I'm pretty sure
I could get 100 bucks

13:13.961 --> 13:15.728
for this purple chair.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.597
- Oh, my God.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.999
What'd you find?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.667
- The Mother of
the Year award.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.004
- Doesn't have your name on it.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.672
.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.307
- Don't worry, your mom
didn't get it either.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.475
off.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.510
- Maybe it skips
two generations.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.512
- I might not be
Mother of the Year,

13:32.612 --> 13:34.447
but Jarrod's winning
Butthole of the Year.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.615
Whew.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.650
I'm gonna tell you
what I see back here, J.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.353
Tons of paperwork
and Christmas decorations.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.588
- Yeah, right.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.156
There can't be a whole unit
with no value.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.758
- There's a wedding dress
in the box.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.160
- Try it on.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.462
- Whoo! Look at this thing.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.830
- I can't believe
you're putting that on.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.866
You are a disgusting woman.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.902
- You know who I think
would like this dress?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.236
*

13:56.336 --> 13:57.337
The Vegas ladies.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.738
I don't get it.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.240
I don't get it.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.977
- He's gonna be here soon.
Relax.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.712
*

14:05.812 --> 14:08.215
I asked my buddy, Ken Hawkins
of Mountain Motorsports,

14:08.315 --> 14:10.817
to come to my locker to see
if he can get that ATV running.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.053
- My name is Gunter.
- He's not riding it.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.421
- Uh-huh, well, that's good.
- Yeah, right.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.056
- Gotta get that hair
up out of the way there.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.391
That's funny.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.195
- All right, we have gas...

14:22.295 --> 14:24.898
- Blup-blup-blup-blup-
blup-blup-blup. I hear it.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.766
- Then we have a battery.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.468
- Ta-da!

14:28.568 --> 14:30.470
First the positive,
then the negative.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.239
- All right, give it a fire.
Choke her up.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.407
- Oh, wow.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.943
It almost fired--

14:36.043 --> 14:37.777
- That's no good.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.046
It's not turning.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.780
- How did he break it
by pushing one button?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.049
- He did.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.883
You just don't touch it.
- Okay.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.518
Is there a little pump
on there?

14:45.618 --> 14:47.054
- No, that's your choke.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.122
It's a quad, not a weed eater.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.224
Hey, Ken...

14:51.324 --> 14:52.792
- Give me some.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.427
- Elderly abuse.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.896
It's not funny.
- It's kind of funny.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.231
- Give her a shot.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.299
*

14:59.399 --> 15:00.900
- There it is...

15:01.001 --> 15:02.002
There it is!

15:02.102 --> 15:04.004
Come on!

15:04.104 --> 15:05.405
- Nice! Whoo!

15:05.505 --> 15:08.942
*

15:09.042 --> 15:10.610
I can't believe
I bought this for parts,

15:10.710 --> 15:13.180
and now I have the title,
and it runs!

15:13.280 --> 15:14.747
What do you think it's worth?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.516
- Um, on the retail market,

15:16.616 --> 15:18.685
I think you can get
upwards of about $2,000.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.886
- Nice!
- I like it.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.022
- But if you're selling it
to me as a dealer...

15:22.122 --> 15:23.456
*

15:23.556 --> 15:26.259
Probably somewhere upwards
of 1,100 bucks or so.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.128
Okay, cool.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.430
We can work something out
where I wholesale it to you.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.831
- I could probably
do something like that.

15:31.931 --> 15:32.832
- Let's take it out.
So, if it runs,

15:32.932 --> 15:33.833
it's yours for 1,100.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.668
- Let's get the party started.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.337
- Yeah!

15:37.437 --> 15:39.472
There it goes.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.012
- Well, this looks like
the place, for sure.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.447
Hello?

15:47.547 --> 15:48.915
I'm back in West Covina

15:49.016 --> 15:51.684
to meet Tracy Lenhart
at Covina Coin & Jewelry

15:51.784 --> 15:53.153
to show her my jewels.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.421
*

15:54.521 --> 15:55.755
- What did you think
you had here?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.024
- Well, I'm not really sure,

15:57.124 --> 15:59.526
but I thought maybe a red ruby

15:59.626 --> 16:02.129
and an aquamarine
and a diamond.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.130
- Wow.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.731
If it's a red ruby,

16:04.831 --> 16:06.533
I mean, that's gotta be a...

16:06.633 --> 16:09.002
$15,000 stone.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.703
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.105
Let's take a look.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.173
*

16:13.273 --> 16:14.541
Hmm.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.944
*

16:18.045 --> 16:19.512
*

16:19.612 --> 16:21.781
Yeah, this is definitely...

16:21.881 --> 16:22.949
*

16:23.050 --> 16:24.384
Not real.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.319
*

16:26.419 --> 16:28.121
A ruby is red,

16:28.221 --> 16:30.790
like a-drop-of-blood red.
- Right.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.093
- So you can clearly
tell the difference.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.761
It does not even look genuine.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.230
It looks like it's lab-created.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.998
Let's move on to this one.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.967
Aquamarines are usually

16:41.068 --> 16:43.470
a little bit lighter
in blue color.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.272
Mm.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.107
This one has some wear on it.

16:47.207 --> 16:51.311
It's got a lot of chips
around the side.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.513
It, as well...

16:53.613 --> 16:55.948
is not genuine.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.618
- But can I get any money
out of these at all?

17:01.488 --> 17:03.823
*

17:03.923 --> 17:05.258
No, I'm afraid
they're worthless.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.094
They're just colored glass.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.363
*

17:10.463 --> 17:13.333
- Hopefully we don't
go three for three.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.535
- I think you might
have a winner.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.537
*

17:17.637 --> 17:18.905
Hmm.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.442
This looks--it looks good.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.044
Let's go to
the electronic tester.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.780
- You are really getting
professional on this here.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.316
Yes, I am.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.718
That does look like a diamond.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.186
Let's see.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.387
*

17:34.487 --> 17:35.622
Diamond.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.357
- Yeah! Confirmed!
- Well, I'll be damned.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.759
I got one good one
out of three.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.163
- It's nice quality;
it's good color.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.899
This size would retail
for about...

17:46.999 --> 17:48.835
*

17:48.935 --> 17:51.070
$100 for your stone right here.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.041
I thought I had
a diamond in the rough.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.844
Turns out...
I just had a rough diamond.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.513
I appreciate your time in
educating me on all this stuff.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.981
- You're welcome.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.018
- Hi, guys.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.520
- We're meeting with
Michael Voss,

18:07.620 --> 18:09.055
co-founder of
the Southern California

18:09.156 --> 18:11.391
Youth Cricket Academy,
about the gear we found.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.559
Boop!
- Whoo-hoo!

18:12.659 --> 18:14.694
- Oh, yeah, and Bozek's here.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.996
- Okay, well, I've been
playing cricket all my life,

18:17.096 --> 18:19.332
going back to the days
in South Africa.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.434
And these are both part of

18:21.534 --> 18:24.871
a children beginner playset.
- Okay.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.706
- And then, let me take
a look at this bat.

18:26.806 --> 18:27.974
- All right.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.109
- This is an adult-sized bat,
uh, made in Australia,

18:30.210 --> 18:32.445
and it's in
pretty good condition.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.847
Cricket is very much
like baseball.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.616
You got a batter
that's gonna use a bat

18:36.716 --> 18:39.118
instead of a, uh--
a baseball, uh...

18:39.219 --> 18:41.053
- Bat.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.922
You got a bowler
instead of a pitcher.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.991
- Okay.
- You've got a wicket-keeper

18:45.091 --> 18:47.194
that basically is your catcher.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.261
Wicket-keeper.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.029
- So, the wickets
are the target

18:50.129 --> 18:52.399
that the batting team
is gonna defend.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.767
The goal is for the bowler
to knock the bail off.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.369
So, ball hits the wicket,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.271
and the bail falls off
like that,

18:58.371 --> 18:59.272
that is sufficient.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.607
- All right, so...

19:00.707 --> 19:01.608
now that you've seen
everything,

19:01.708 --> 19:03.276
what do you think it's worth?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.111
- A beginner playset,

19:05.212 --> 19:08.348
this would go for...

19:08.448 --> 19:09.349
$30.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.351
- Boo...

19:11.451 --> 19:12.519
- Uh, but these pads

19:12.619 --> 19:14.187
are actually in
really good condition,

19:14.287 --> 19:17.390
and I'd say...$50.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.259
- Okay, that's good.
- Okay.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.094
- For this one, this is
the nicest of the three.

19:22.195 --> 19:25.498
This brand is actually used
by professional players.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.033
You can see
the grain of the bat,

19:27.133 --> 19:29.336
and this is
a good-quality willow.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.738
So, uh, given the condition,

19:31.838 --> 19:33.406
I would say for this...

19:33.506 --> 19:35.308
*

19:35.408 --> 19:36.776
Would get about $100.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.311
- 100 bucks.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.713
- Plus 80 bucks: 180 bucks.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.382
180 bucks is great.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.883
I'm feeling good today.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.185
- All right, we ready
to give this sport a try?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.955
- Okay! My goal is to hit
those sticks right there?

19:49.055 --> 19:50.857
- Correct.
- Puh!

19:50.957 --> 19:51.991
- All right.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.026
*

19:54.126 --> 19:55.828
Ahh!

19:55.928 --> 19:57.430
- Okay, a good style...

19:57.530 --> 19:59.899
not a great end product.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.502
announcer: Darrell Sheets
had a gem of a locker,

20:02.602 --> 20:05.137
bringing in over $2,000.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.840
Rene and Gunter went off-road,

20:07.940 --> 20:10.810
and rode off
with 650 big ones,

20:10.910 --> 20:13.380
while Jarrod and Brandi
missed the wicket,

20:13.480 --> 20:17.116
leaving the pitch
with a measly 70 bucks.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.117
*

20:18.217 --> 20:19.719
- All right, let's play ball!

20:19.819 --> 20:21.087
- Kay, let's play!

20:21.187 --> 20:23.222
- That's how the girls play.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.457
- Rookie.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.025
*

20:26.125 --> 20:27.059
- Oh!

20:27.159 --> 20:29.262
- Yay!

20:29.362 --> 20:31.030
First!

20:31.130 --> 20:32.332
Second!

20:33.800 --> 20:35.868
- You just went to third plate.
That's it.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.437
- It's been a long time
since I got to third base.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.671
Leave me alone, Bozek.
