{\an9}- Caroline, you look
like a country music star.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.390
{\an8}How'd you get
those curls?

00:15.473 --> 00:17.475
{\an7}- I slept sitting up
with Coke cans in my hair,

00:17.559 --> 00:21.146
{\an7}but it was worth it.
These pictures last forever.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.522
{\an8}- Pictures?

00:22.605 --> 00:25.608
{\an7}- Oh, my God. How could you
forget about Picture Day?

00:25.692 --> 00:28.027
{\an7}I gave myself a colonic
and full body exfoliation

00:28.111 --> 00:29.195
{\an8}just to prepare.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.613
{\an7}- What are you slathering
yourself with?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.698
{\an8}- Self tanner.
It takes a while to set,

00:32.782 --> 00:33.950
{\an8}but by this afternoon,
I will be

00:34.033 --> 00:35.618
{\an8}intriguingly
ethnically ambiguous.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.787
{\an8}- Dudes, my pic
is gonna look jacked.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.039
{\an8}I haven't had my eyebrows done
in three weeks.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.374
{\an9}- You look
naturally beautiful.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.042
{\an7}- You look like
a '70s vagina with eyes,

00:43.126 --> 00:44.419
{\an8}but don't worry.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.045
{\an7}I have an emergency
waxing kit in my desk.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.297
{\an8}I can totally fix them.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.631
{\an8}- Thanks.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.010
{\an8}- Morning, ladies,
you all look really nice.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.636
{\an8}Feldman.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.472
{\an8}I just wanted to stop by
to tell you

00:55.555 --> 00:58.224
{\an8}that we've hired
a new photographer this year,

00:58.308 --> 01:02.061
{\an8}Don LaRondasack.
No more Geoff with a G.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.521
{\an7}- Oh, but I liked
Geoff with a G.

01:03.605 --> 01:04.938
{\an7}He always put me
at ease.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.816
{\an7}I get really self-conscious
having my picture taken.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.985
{\an8}- Well, I'm sure
this LaRondasack fellow

01:09.068 --> 01:10.487
{\an8}will be just fine.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.740
{\an8}He's got a firm hand-shake,
looks like he works out,

01:13.823 --> 01:16.117
{\an8}nice smile.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.331
{\an8}Anyway, it's time to announce
whose class gets the honor

01:21.414 --> 01:24.501
{\an8}of having their photo taken
with our mascot, Millard.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.045
{\an8}- He's not a mascot.
He's an "ig-whuana,"

01:27.128 --> 01:28.797
{\an7}and he shouldn't be
paraded around like a trophy

01:28.880 --> 01:31.424
{\an7}by the winning class each year.
It makes me sick.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.760
{\an9}- Well, I love it,
and I really need a win.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.888
{\an8}This could turn
my year around.

01:36.971 --> 01:40.683
{\an9}There's only so much Chardonnay
and cough syrup can do.

01:40.767 --> 01:45.313
{\an8}- The winner of
the school spirit prize is...

01:45.396 --> 01:46.606
{\an8}Ms. Watson's class!

01:46.689 --> 01:47.690
{\an3}- Oh!

01:47.774 --> 01:49.275
{\an3}[gasps]
Oh, my God!

01:49.359 --> 01:50.819
{\an3}Oh, my God!
Oh, my--

01:50.902 --> 01:52.362
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.780
{\an3}Thank you,
thank you so much.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.281
Oh, my God, this is gonna
change everything!

01:55.365 --> 01:57.325
{\an1}- Easy, tiger.
It's just a dumb iguana.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.911
- Nobody likes a sore loser,
Deb, especially a winner,

01:59.994 --> 02:02.622
and I am the winner!
I am the winner!

02:02.705 --> 02:06.376
I am the winner!
I did it! Yeah!

02:06.459 --> 02:09.545
In your face! In your face!
In your face!

02:09.628 --> 02:11.548
- Oh, cool. I didn't think
that you were gonna do me.

02:11.631 --> 02:16.761
- Yes! Oh, how you like me now?
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

02:20.640 --> 02:22.642
{\an3}- God, that stuff is making
this whole room

02:22.725 --> 02:24.853
{\an3}smell like a sloppy
sorority girl.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.188
{\an1}- Thank you, but I can't
wax you right now.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.898
I'm in the middle
of my own crisis.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.068
I'm still not the right shade.
I'm supposed to be Camel Taupe.

02:32.151 --> 02:34.904
{\an3}- No, camel toe isn't a color,
it's a shape.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.865
- Camel Taupe, with a "p"!

02:36.948 --> 02:37.866
{\an3}- Oh.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.200
{\an1}- [sighs]
I'm getting carpal tunnel

02:39.284 --> 02:40.702
{\an1}trying to deal
with this streaky mess.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.620
- Oh, here, I'll help.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.999
I'll do it everywhere
so it all looks the same.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.333
{\an3}- Just make sure
it looks good.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.419
- Oh, don't worry,
I got this.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.379
I had to paint a rec center
one summer

02:51.462 --> 02:53.590
for community service.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.718
There she goes.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.428
{\an1}- Okay, Cinderella,
do me a favor.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.804
{\an1}I want you
to look at the birdie.

02:59.888 --> 03:00.930
Where's the birdie?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.932
{\an1}That's not a birdie,
that's my hand!

03:03.016 --> 03:04.267
- What? Come on.
- [laughs]

03:04.350 --> 03:06.269
{\an1}Great job.
Next!

03:08.104 --> 03:09.022
{\an1}Hi.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.940
- Hi.
I just want to warn you

03:11.024 --> 03:13.359
I get a little nervous
when I have my picture taken.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.278
{\an1}- Oh.
Well, there's no need to worry.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.114
Old Don's gonna make sure that
you're very well taken care of.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.450
All you gotta do is
sit back and relax.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.118
- Okay.
- All right. Now, normally,

03:22.201 --> 03:23.244
{\an1}at this point,
I would say, "Cheese,"

03:23.328 --> 03:24.287
but you're not a mouse.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.372
- [laughs]
- There it is.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.042
{\an1}Oh.
What are you worried about?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.210
{\an1}You have a very
captivating smile.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.587
It's very nice.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.422
{\an1}You know what?
Let's take another one,

03:34.505 --> 03:37.675
{\an1}all right?
All right, this time, um...

03:37.759 --> 03:39.427
just shake your jaw loose.
Kind of give me a little--

03:39.510 --> 03:40.845
[both blubbering]
- There you go,

03:40.929 --> 03:42.138
{\an1}and while you're doing that,
then just kind of--

03:42.221 --> 03:44.140
{\an1}do that, push out your lips.
Just--

03:44.223 --> 03:46.059
{\an1}Yeah, just like--like you're
tasting something sour,

03:46.142 --> 03:48.061
{\an1}you know?
Yeah, there you go.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.313
{\an1}Very nice, very nice.
Um--

03:50.396 --> 03:51.814
{\an1}I don't know, arch your back
maybe, just--

03:51.898 --> 03:53.942
{\an1}yeah, I want you sitting up
straight and tall,

03:54.025 --> 03:55.860
very confident,
very ...strong.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.487
{\an1}There you go,
arch that back.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.030
{\an1}Nice, now give me
a little twist.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.490
{\an1}Maybe lower the shoulder
a little bit. Yeah, that's it.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.658
{\an1}Don't--don't lose
the lips.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.493
{\an1}Something sour.
Mmm, what's going on?

04:03.576 --> 04:05.870
{\an1}I don't know, yeah,
you nasty little slut.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.038
{\an1}Okay.
[laughs]

04:07.121 --> 04:08.665
{\an1}Great.
Well done, very nice.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.333
{\an1}We're done here.
Next.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.587
{\an1}You look like a baseball player.
Am I right? Huh?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.302
{\an1}- Blake?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.305
{\an1}Can I talk to you
for a minute?

04:30.269 --> 04:32.021
{\an1}Where did you get
that shirt?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.815
{\an3}- My mom sent it to me
from Myrtle Beach.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.859
{\an1}- Oh. So your mom and dad
are still separated?

04:36.943 --> 04:38.027
{\an3}- Yeah.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.195
- Your poor father.

04:39.278 --> 04:41.239
{\an1}He's such a nice, caring,
perfect man.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.033
It must be lonely for him...

04:44.117 --> 04:45.243
and for you.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.536
{\an3}- Is that what you wanted
to talk about?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.705
{\an1}- No.
I'm just concerned

04:48.788 --> 04:50.790
{\an1}that only the first word
on your shirt

04:50.873 --> 04:54.335
{\an1}will show in the photo,
you know what I mean?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.629
{\an3}- No.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.006
{\an1}- I'll just call your dad
and have him

04:58.089 --> 04:59.298
{\an1}bring you
another shirt.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.675
- I'll call--
- I'll call him.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.427
- I'll call him--
- I'll call him.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.559
- Now I know for some of us,
it's been

05:09.642 --> 05:14.397
an emotionally exhausting year
fraught with disappointment,

05:14.480 --> 05:16.566
and we thought that getting
our class picture taken

05:16.649 --> 05:18.818
with Millard would finally
get the pendulum

05:18.901 --> 05:20.987
swinging
in the other direction,

05:21.070 --> 05:25.158
but sometimes you win
and sometimes you lose,

05:25.241 --> 05:29.245
and unfortunately, today,
I have some sad news...

05:29.328 --> 05:32.582
For the other classes...
because we won!

05:32.665 --> 05:34.834
[all cheering]

05:34.917 --> 05:36.085
- Oh! oh!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.588
- We love you,
Ms. Watson!

05:38.671 --> 05:41.466
- It's the best day
of my life!

05:41.549 --> 05:42.759
{\an3}- Millard!

05:42.842 --> 05:46.804
all: Millard! Millard!
Millard! Millard!

05:46.888 --> 05:48.765
Millard! Millard!

05:48.848 --> 05:51.309
[trailing off]
Millard. Millard.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.103
- He's not doing anything.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.980
- Well, I think
he's asleep.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.274
Maybe you could wake him up,
Rodney?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.493
Maybe tap a little harder?

06:10.745 --> 06:12.789
- Millard's dead!

06:12.872 --> 06:14.415
[all screaming]

06:14.499 --> 06:17.877
- Oh. Oh. Okay.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.760
- I know for some of us,
we thought that this was

06:25.843 --> 06:28.721
{\an1}going to pull us
out of an emotional nose dive,

06:28.805 --> 06:32.809
{\an1}but Millard has
passed away.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.603
{\an1}Has anyone ever had a pet
die before?

06:35.686 --> 06:37.647
{\an1}David?

06:37.730 --> 06:39.315
{\an3}- Pets don't die.
My mom said

06:39.398 --> 06:40.525
{\an3}all of my hermit crabs
went to the farm.

06:40.608 --> 06:44.112
{\an1}- There's no farm, dummy.
They're dead.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.948
- Rodney, that's enough.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.493
{\an1}David, I think it's really nice
that your mom told you

06:50.576 --> 06:53.663
{\an1}there's a farm.
It's a wonderful thought.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.457
- So there's no farm?

06:56.541 --> 06:57.667
- I didn't say that.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.335
{\an3}- What are you gonna
tell me next,

06:59.418 --> 07:02.004
there's no Santa Claus?

07:05.633 --> 07:07.635
{\an3}Why are you taking so long
to answer?

07:11.222 --> 07:12.431
- Poor Millard.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.517
- I know.
I tried to talk to my students

07:14.600 --> 07:16.727
about death, but then
I ruined Christmas.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.647
- Just order them a pizza.
This just in,

07:19.730 --> 07:21.607
kids love pizza.
[scoffs]

07:21.691 --> 07:22.859
{\an3}- You could tell them
about heaven,

07:22.942 --> 07:27.071
{\an3}but apparently,
that's "illegal" in schools.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.449
- All I can say is,
we better watch our backs.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.576
Millard's number one.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.201
- What are you talking about?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.036
- Rule of threes.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.413
Death always comes
in threes.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.039
- No, that's a myth.
- Maybe you should celebrate

07:37.123 --> 07:38.207
{\an3}Millard's life
by having a ceremony.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.417
- That's a really good idea.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.460
- Hey,
did the photographer say

07:41.544 --> 07:42.545
anything inappropriate
to any of you?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.881
- I haven't had
my picture taken yet.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.675
I still gotta deal with
these mustaches over my eyes.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.385
- He was really nice to me.
Is something wrong?

07:49.468 --> 07:51.554
{\an1}- Yeah, you know what?
There is.

07:51.637 --> 07:55.558
I will not be treated
like a piece of meat.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.061
[door closing]

07:59.145 --> 08:02.690
- So where'd we land
on the pizza?

08:02.773 --> 08:05.234
{\an3}- Don?
Do you have a minute?

08:05.318 --> 08:09.405
- Well, I'm here all day,
so I've got 1,440 of them,

08:09.488 --> 08:11.741
{\an1}to be exact.
[laughs]

08:11.824 --> 08:13.242
{\an1}That's how many minutes
are in a day.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.912
- Yeah, I got that.
- Okay.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.497
{\an3}- I just want you
to know...

08:18.581 --> 08:20.499
{\an3}I was not amused
by what you said to me.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.043
{\an1}- Ugh.
The mouse joke, huh?

08:22.126 --> 08:24.045
I know, I'm sorry.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.087
{\an3}- No.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.882
You called me a--
nasty little slut.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.551
{\an1}- I did?

08:30.635 --> 08:31.677
I do not recall that.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.597
{\an3}- I feel that
you saw I was nervous

08:34.679 --> 08:36.265
{\an3}and preyed
on my insecurity.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.602
{\an1}- Well, wow, I...definitely
didn't mean to upset you,

08:39.684 --> 08:43.563
and I sure didn't want
to cause any offense.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.943
{\an1}I have a sister,
so I really respect women.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.236
{\an3}- Okay.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.946
{\an1}- Let me make it up to you,
okay?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.405
{\an1}Let me just take
another picture of you.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.533
{\an1}It'll be fine, it'll be--
I want you to be comfortable.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.410
I want this to be
a good experience.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.372
- Okay.
- Okay, there you go.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.957
{\an1}If you don't mind,
say, "Cheese."

09:01.040 --> 09:02.792
{\an1}Unless you're
lactose intolerant!

09:03.209 --> 09:05.169
{\an1}All right.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.545
{\an1}Oh, great.
We're all set.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.550
{\an1}Hit the bricks,
you dirty little hooker.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.635
- [gasps]

09:12.718 --> 09:13.469
{\an1}- Okey dokey, Smokey,
who's next?

09:13.552 --> 09:16.264
{\an1}Get in here!
Wow, look at you.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.308
[bagpipes playing]

09:23.813 --> 09:28.693
♪ The pipes,
the pipes are calling ♪

09:28.776 --> 09:32.154
- Did you guys know
that art can happen anywhere?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.990
Yeah, it can.

09:34.073 --> 09:38.160
That's why we have things
like flash mobs and graffiti.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.329
Can anyone else give me
some other examples of art?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.664
Good, yeah.
Lucas?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.499
{\an3}- Well, artists
like Jackson Pollock

09:43.582 --> 09:45.710
{\an3}and Wassily Kandinksy
demonstrated

09:45.793 --> 09:48.379
{\an3}that we do not need
to accurately represent--

09:48.462 --> 09:50.172
- If anyone has
an extra video game,

09:50.256 --> 09:53.009
it sounds like Lucas
could really use one.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.511
All right, guys,
now we're going to see

09:55.594 --> 09:57.555
art happen
right in front of us.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.015
Crazy, right?

09:59.098 --> 10:02.143
Ms. Snap is
going to wax my eyebrows.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.561
{\an1}- Just so you know, I don't
normally look like this.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.856
{\an1}When my tan sets,
I will look like J-Lo.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.649
- This is gonna be
really fun.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.111
It's like arts and crafts,
but on my face.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.488
{\an1}- Wow, that was
impressive.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.865
{\an1}When I have
something personal to do,

10:15.948 --> 10:17.700
{\an1}I just tell my kids
to zip it and silent-read.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.661
{\an3}- Oh, yeah, I can turn anything
into a lesson.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.330
{\an3}Tomorrow I'm teaching math
by having them

10:22.413 --> 10:24.415
add up my tax receipts.

10:24.498 --> 10:27.251
{\an1}- [whispering]
Here we go.

10:27.335 --> 10:31.005
Okay, one, two, three!

10:31.088 --> 10:34.091
{\an3}- Oh!

10:40.222 --> 10:43.809
{\an1}- Art.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.855
{\an3}- Since when do you
do makeup?

10:47.938 --> 10:51.108
{\an1}- I have to fix my eyebrows.
Snap gave my face a Brazilian.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.069
- [sighs]

10:53.152 --> 10:55.863
{\an3}- What's wrong? Did someone
put compost in the recycling?

10:55.946 --> 10:58.824
- No. This morning,
the photographer called me

10:58.908 --> 11:00.159
a "nasty little slut."

11:00.242 --> 11:01.577
- Wait, what?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.579
- Yeah, and when I went to go
talk to him about it later,

11:03.662 --> 11:05.831
he called me
a "dirty little hooker."

11:05.915 --> 11:07.083
I know.
I was shocked too.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.378
{\an3}- Oh, hell no!
If he thinks he's gonna get away

11:10.461 --> 11:14.131
{\an3}with that Cosby crap,
he's got another think coming.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.259
- You don't think she's
gonna hurt him, do you?

11:17.343 --> 11:18.552
- Probably.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.639
{\an1}She nut-punched Mr. Werner
for taking her parking space.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.932
{\an1}Although in her defense,
she did have

11:23.015 --> 11:24.725
{\an1}a ten-day period
that month.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.853
- [humming]

11:32.358 --> 11:33.734
- Ms. Bennigan?

11:33.818 --> 11:35.236
- [whispering]
Hot Dad.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.612
- What?
- Hmm?

11:36.695 --> 11:38.072
Nothing.
Hey, you.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.366
{\an3}- I got your voicemail,
I came down as soon as I could.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.368
- Thank you so much.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.497
{\an1}Did you bring
a new shirt for Blake?

11:46.580 --> 11:47.998
{\an3}- Shirt?
In your message,

11:48.082 --> 11:50.084
you just said to come down
to the school and hung up.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.544
{\an3}It sounded like
an emergency.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.130
- Oh, um, it is.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.299
{\an1}You see, what Blake's shirt says
is inappropriate.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.300
- What does it say?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.761
{\an1}- Well--
[chuckles]

12:00.845 --> 12:02.179
{\an1}You know what shirt
he was wearing.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.390
{\an3}- I don't.
I'm sorry,

12:04.473 --> 12:06.267
still trying to get used to
this whole single dad thing.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.810
- [laughs nervously]

12:07.893 --> 12:10.396
{\an3}- Are you all right?
You're turning really red.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.898
{\an1}- Dick!

12:12.982 --> 12:15.818
{\an1}His shirt says "Dick.
Mack's.

12:15.901 --> 12:20.364
{\an1}Dick Mack's Crab Shack."
[laughs]

12:20.448 --> 12:22.658
And today is picture day.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.326
{\an3}- Oh, God.
I didn't even realize.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.327
When are the photos?

12:25.411 --> 12:26.537
- They're in line
at the cafeteria

12:26.620 --> 12:27.538
to take them right now.

12:27.621 --> 12:28.998
{\an3}- [sighs]
Well,

12:29.081 --> 12:31.041
{\an3}there's no way I can get
back to the house in time.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.918
{\an3}And we can't have him
wearing that shirt.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.546
{\an1}- No.
<i>We</i> can't.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.964
- You know what?

12:37.047 --> 12:39.925
{\an3}It's gonna be a little big
on him, but...

12:41.760 --> 12:42.928
{\an1}- [groans]

12:43.012 --> 12:44.346
- He can wear this.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.352
{\an1}- [laughs]

12:50.436 --> 12:51.353
- You all right?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.730
{\an1}- [laughs]

12:52.813 --> 12:54.732
{\an1}I'm fine.
[laughs]

12:54.815 --> 12:57.693
{\an1}I'll be back right--
[laughs]

12:57.776 --> 12:59.195
I'll be back ri--

12:59.278 --> 13:01.864
{\an1}I'ma be right back.
[laughs] Okay.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.915
- Today has been
a hard day.

13:10.998 --> 13:14.376
But you know,
Millard isn't gone forever.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.836
Even though he's not here
physically,

13:15.920 --> 13:19.965
his spirit is
actually everywhere.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.467
<i>Now, why don't we</i>
<i>lay him to rest</i>

13:21.550 --> 13:23.886
so he can finally be free?

13:37.983 --> 13:42.279
{\an3}- Oh, my God!
It's the old Millard!

13:42.363 --> 13:44.782
{\an1}- Okay, let's just calm down,
everyone.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.910
[all screaming]

13:56.252 --> 13:58.128
{\an3}- Hey!
You just ruined

13:58.212 --> 13:59.922
{\an3}the most important day
of the year for me.

14:00.005 --> 14:00.881
{\an3}It is picture day,
and I look

14:00.965 --> 14:04.176
{\an3}like a Florida Panhandle
meth addict!

14:04.260 --> 14:08.097
{\an3}What are you surprised about?
Of course I am mad.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.182
Look at what you did to me!

14:10.266 --> 14:12.351
{\an3}I was gonna be the hottest
teacher this year

14:12.434 --> 14:14.436
{\an3}because Theresa Larson
looks like a fat pig

14:14.520 --> 14:17.314
now that she's pregnant.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.482
Don't act surprised.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.985
{\an3}Everyone is thinking it.
I am just saying it.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.196
{\an3}And now I look like
my asshole

14:24.280 --> 14:25.781
{\an3}before I bleached it!
[sobs]

14:25.864 --> 14:28.200
{\an3}Does it surprise you
that I'm crying?

14:28.284 --> 14:32.538
{\an3}'Cause I am the most sensitive
person in this school.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.208
{\an3}How dare you be surprised
that I have feelings?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.960
{\an3}Screw you!

14:41.839 --> 14:45.926
{\an3}I'm sorry.
You should be surprised.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.138
My behavior is
unacceptable.

14:52.391 --> 14:52.975
You're the best.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.853
You have pizza breath.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.487
- [sniffs deeply]

15:05.571 --> 15:06.488
- Oh, Ms. Bennigan.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.074
- Yes, that's me.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.659
{\an1}- Oh.
You all right?

15:10.743 --> 15:16.206
{\an3}- Oh, I-I was just--making sure
the shirt was still clean.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.499
{\an3}[laughs]
Let me just check

15:17.583 --> 15:18.834
a couple more things here.

15:18.917 --> 15:23.547
{\an3}Check, check, check,
check, check, check, chicken.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.007
- Is it okay?

15:25.090 --> 15:26.133
- It's perfect.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.266
- Can I--let me just--

15:35.768 --> 15:37.144
{\an1}Oh.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.520
{\an1}Yeah.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.730
There you go.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.231
{\an1}Just gonna go
put it back on.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.232
{\an3}- Okay.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.068
- All right.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.405
- Well, howdy, partner.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.699
{\an1}I'm the fastest photographer
in the west.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.868
{\an1}Just pull up a seat
and saddle up.

15:52.951 --> 15:55.204
{\an3}- Oh, so I can ride you?
Huh?

15:55.287 --> 15:58.207
{\an3}You'd like that, wouldn't you,
you perverted freak?

15:58.290 --> 16:01.919
{\an3}I know all about you,
and I bet you'd just love it

16:02.002 --> 16:05.547
{\an3}if I posed
like a nasty little slut

16:05.631 --> 16:07.257
and gobbled your balls!

16:07.341 --> 16:08.509
- Excuse me?

16:08.592 --> 16:09.885
{\an3}- Oh, I know pigs
like you.

16:09.968 --> 16:13.222
{\an3}You love a good ball gobble.
Huh?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.598
{\an3}Oh, like this? Huh?
Little gobble like this?

16:14.682 --> 16:17.309
{\an3}[babbling]
Huh? Huh?

16:17.393 --> 16:18.769
{\an3}[babbling]

16:18.852 --> 16:21.230
{\an3}Huh? Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.731
Yeah, you like that?
What about this, huh?

16:22.815 --> 16:23.816
{\an3}Huh?
What about this, huh?

16:23.899 --> 16:26.276
{\an3}Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Oh, oh.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.569
{\an3}Oh, ah, ah.
[groaning]

16:27.653 --> 16:29.947
{\an3}Huh? Huh?
Oh,

16:30.030 --> 16:31.949
{\an3}are you getting your rocks off
on this, you freak?

16:32.032 --> 16:35.077
{\an3}[groaning]

16:35.160 --> 16:38.372
Now! Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.875
{\an3}You are gonna take my picture
and you are not gonna say

16:41.959 --> 16:46.422
{\an3}one inappropriate thing to me
or any other teacher ever again.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.466
{\an3}You got that,
you weasel-dicked meat-jerker?

16:50.884 --> 16:54.012
{\an1}- Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.389
I have a sister.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.768
Okay, uh...

16:59.852 --> 17:02.604
please--please smile.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.191
Okay, lovely.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.111
- I know today
we've all experienced things

17:09.194 --> 17:14.324
that are...
difficult to understand,

17:14.407 --> 17:16.492
and I spoke
with Principal Pearson

17:16.577 --> 17:19.204
and he arranged for
the district's grief counselor,

17:19.288 --> 17:22.040
Mrs. Moore, to come
and talk to us about death

17:22.124 --> 17:26.462
and some of the feelings
we are having.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.590
Mrs. Moore?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.057
{\an1}- [groans]

17:39.141 --> 17:40.392
- Mrs. Moore?

17:42.186 --> 17:43.061
Mrs. Moore?

17:43.145 --> 17:45.314
{\an1}- Is this
a demonstration?

17:45.397 --> 17:49.151
- Uh--uh,
Don't worry, it's all right.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.986
I'm sure she's just
taking a nap.

17:51.069 --> 17:53.197
{\an1}- That's what you said
about Millard!

17:53.280 --> 17:55.282
- Look, everything's
going to be fine.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.412
Mrs. Moore?

18:01.246 --> 18:04.833
Rule of threes.
Number two.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.960
<i>- She's dead!</i>

[all screaming]

18:15.093 --> 18:16.595
<i>[indistinct radio chatter]</i>

18:16.678 --> 18:20.682
- Um, hello, Mrs. Cregan?
This is Ms. Watson.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.893
I was just calling
all the parents to let them know

18:22.976 --> 18:26.230
that the children witnessed
a couple of deaths today.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.234
- Ms. Cannon?

18:30.317 --> 18:32.361
{\an1}Can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

18:32.444 --> 18:35.030
{\an1}Ms. Cannon, please, can I just
talk to you for a minute?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.324
{\an3}- What?

18:37.407 --> 18:39.868
- I just want to apologize
for the way I acted today.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.830
It was totally
inappropriate.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.082
{\an1}I don't even know where
that first comment came from.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.501
{\an1}It just--
And then when you confronted me,

18:47.584 --> 18:49.837
{\an1}I was--
well, I was ashamed.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.339
{\an1}I don't know if I told you this
or not, but...

18:52.422 --> 18:54.341
{\an1}[sighs]
I have a sister,

18:54.424 --> 18:57.928
and I really respect women.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.763
