How-How about this?

10:48.509 --> 10:52.136
Try missing tomorrow and then just-
just see how that feels.

10:52.221 --> 10:55.597
Ay, Jay,
you're so good to me.

10:55.681 --> 10:58.974
That's why I have to go.
You're gonna be there for me,

10:59.059 --> 11:02.435
the same way I'm gonna be there for you
at Maria Victoria's first communion.

11:02.518 --> 11:05.855
Wait a minute,
that's back on the table?

11:05.980 --> 11:09.607
Well, you know, we didn't want to break curfew.
[ Dede ] Curfew?

11:09.691 --> 11:13.610
Oh, right, as if you two
ever honored a curfew.

11:13.693 --> 11:16.028
I love your stories, Nana.
Keep on going.

11:16.112 --> 11:18.239
Your father used to
scare the crap out of me.

11:18.364 --> 11:20.156
Mm-hmm. [Dede] Well, evidently,

11:20.241 --> 11:24.577
not enough to keep you from
sneaking in at 3:00 in the morning.

11:24.660 --> 11:27.955
I didn't know whether to punish
you or make you pancakes.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.624
Hey! [Chuckles] [ Phil ] Halfway
through dinner, I told Claire...

11:31.706 --> 11:33.916
that whenever she had the urge
to lash out at her mother,

11:33.999 --> 11:36.960
she should just
squeeze my hand instead.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.754
A doctor had to cut off
my wedding ring.

11:39.837 --> 11:42.965
Claire, you remember that time we cut
school and we went out to the pier-

11:43.090 --> 11:46.466
Mm-hmm. and we played that
game and you won the, uh-

11:46.550 --> 11:48.594
Giant panda bear.
The panda bear, right.

11:48.677 --> 11:50.387
- Yeah. Yes.
- Yeah.

11:50.469 --> 11:52.472
Do you remember
what we did after that?

11:52.555 --> 11:54.098
Yes.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.224
Hey, do you still
like roller coasters?

11:56.308 --> 11:58.433
Not this one.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.811
I know Robbie
was a rogue,

12:00.894 --> 12:03.312
but he could charm
your socks off.

12:03.397 --> 12:04.939
Although I doubt
he stopped there.

12:05.022 --> 12:07.190
[ Laughing]

12:07.273 --> 12:09.276
- Wow, Mom.
- Mom.

12:09.358 --> 12:11.485
We're all adults here,
honey. Pretty much.

12:11.568 --> 12:13.737
Okay, I think we're-
we're done.

12:13.819 --> 12:15.529
Yeah, well,
I better get going.

12:15.612 --> 12:19.323
I've got an early morning run, celebrity client.
Don't ask me who.

12:19.408 --> 12:23.326
Let's just say that if I'm late,
I'll be in “jeopardy”

12:23.411 --> 12:26.787
- Who is Alex Trebek?
- Uh, he's a game show host. Why?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.371
No reason.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.290
Claire.
Yes?

12:31.374 --> 12:32.875
This was incredible.
Thanks a lot.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.625
So great. It was great.
So good to see you.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.211
I know. Catching up was so fun.
You look so good.

12:37.296 --> 12:39.504
Hey, you-
you take good care.

12:39.588 --> 12:41.257
You take good care now.
Yes.

12:41.339 --> 12:43.967
Oh, let's do it.
Let's do that.

12:44.050 --> 12:46.342
[ Chuckles ]
I'll walk you out.

12:47.343 --> 12:48.803
Bye.

12:48.885 --> 12:50.596
- Really, Mom?
- I was young.

12:50.721 --> 12:52.263
I thought he was sexy.
Go to your room.

12:52.346 --> 12:53.932
Okay.

12:58.143 --> 13:01.854
I did it. She brought all the crazy
in her arsenal and I did not crack.

13:01.938 --> 13:03.438
I think a bone
in my hand did.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.274
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

13:05.356 --> 13:06.816
You know what hurt more?
What?

13:06.899 --> 13:08.650
I used to think
your mother loved me.

13:08.735 --> 13:10.777
Apparently, she always
wished you'd married Robbie.

13:10.860 --> 13:14.905
Oh, no, sweetie.
This was all about her trying to annoy me.

13:14.988 --> 13:17.531
Come on, she's practically
walking you two down the aisle.

13:17.614 --> 13:20.409
Oh, he left his phone.

13:20.491 --> 13:22.327
All those Mother's Day cards
I sent her.

13:22.410 --> 13:26.495
All those joke e-mails she forwarded to
me months after I'd already seen 'em.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.956
Well, no more polite L.O.L.'s
for you, Dede.

13:30.206 --> 13:31.249
[Both]
om

13:31.334 --> 13:33.834
Holy cow. Wow.

13:33.918 --> 13:36.545
Okay. Well, you were right.
It's not about me.

13:36.627 --> 13:38.130
Oh, God.

13:41.215 --> 13:44.133
Really? You are a princess.

13:47.136 --> 13:49.387
Stop eyeing the princess.
You're gonna freak her out.

13:49.472 --> 13:52.515
I don't know. I think the whole idea
of needing a prince to come along...

13:52.598 --> 13:55.851
and make you happy sends the wrong
message, Mitchell- I really do.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.143
Really? And a grown man pulling boxer
shorts out of his mouth doesn't?

13:58.226 --> 14:00.437
I'm-
Hey.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.979
Hi, hi.
Hi, hi.

14:02.104 --> 14:03.607
Hi. Hi, sweetie.
Hey, Phil.

14:03.690 --> 14:06.566
Jay. So, where is she?
Where’s Mom?

14:06.650 --> 14:08.443
Yeah, let's get
the weirdness over with.

14:08.568 --> 14:10.403
I thought she was coming with you.
Oh, no, no.

14:10.486 --> 14:11.986
I haven't seen Mom since-
Let's see-

14:12.071 --> 14:14.696
- Oh, she made out with my ex-boyfriend last night.
- What?

14:14.821 --> 14:16.157
Yeah.
No, my God.

14:16.239 --> 14:18.532
Yeah, yeah. And then
she took off with him,

14:18.617 --> 14:20.951
didn't come back to the house
until after I was asleep.

14:21.036 --> 14:25.288
And then this morning left a cute little note
that said, “Having breakfast with Robbie.”

14:25.371 --> 14:28.749
What the hell is she doing?
He's half her age.

14:28.831 --> 14:30.333
Don't say it.

14:30.417 --> 14:34.294
I think it's sweet.
Love is beautiful. It has no age.

14:34.379 --> 14:36.629
When it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

14:36.713 --> 14:39.006
That is the question.

14:39.089 --> 14:40.549
Dad, what's going on
over there?

14:40.632 --> 14:42.424
She was a little nervous
about your mother being here,

14:42.509 --> 14:46.260
so she tried her first Xanax, washed
it down with a shot of tequila.

14:46.345 --> 14:50.306
Ay look at the princess.
It's so beautiful.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.766
Really?
'Cause I don't see it.

Excuse me.

There's the birthday girl.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.563
Glitter?
That'll settle in her lungs.

15:00.646 --> 15:03.523
So I wanted to ask what method
of payment you prefer?

15:03.606 --> 15:05.400
Cash, credit card, check?

15:05.484 --> 15:11.028
Why, princesses don't get paid, except
maybe in laughter and sparkles.

15:11.113 --> 15:12.988
That's nice.
But I really need to know.

15:13.073 --> 15:16.367

girl's birthday wishes-

Fine. You can make the check out
to Party Stars, Incorporated.

Never break character!
Never ever!

15:23.995 --> 15:24.997
But-
But nothing!

15:25.080 --> 15:27.248
When I was a clown,
my shoe caught on fire,

15:27.332 --> 15:30.543
and one of my fellow clowns put me out
with a bucket of flammable confetti.

15:30.626 --> 15:32.877
- What's happening?
- Even as they loaded me into the ambulance,

15:32.962 --> 15:34.629
I continued to make
balloon animals.

15:34.711 --> 15:37.589
- Flammable confetti?
- There was a seltzer bottle right there!

Oh, hi.

Oh, my God.
I'm gonna kill her. I'm-

Stop. No, not- not now.
The last thing I need is some big scene, Claire.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.015
You know she's doing this
just to torture me.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.101
No. She's doing this to get back at me
because I didn't let her stay with us.

You're both wrong.
It's about me.

and I “split” that bottle of wine...

16:03.190 --> 16:05.275
and you “fell asleep”
on the stairs.

I don't know why everybody's
getting so upset about this.

16:08.945 --> 16:13.865
Maybe it's about passion,
about what the body wants.

wants for the heart.

have been treating you good, huh?

but I had a crush on your
mother back in high school.

kind of a fantasy for me.

it's some sort of sick game for you...

people and push people...

Uh, but between you and me, I'm getting some
serious vibes from the princess over here,

play that out. Oh.

may have worked on me when I was a kid,

18:50.060 --> 18:52.227
So much for keeping it
all about Lily.

Well, yeah, and I
certainly didn't help...

journeyman princess like I did.

back into this party. I got this.

I'll go in and tum on some music, bring out
the cupcakes, pump up the bubble machine.

19:07.071 --> 19:08.489
Or-

19:10.156 --> 19:12.909
Is that a roundabout way of saying a
certain clown can come to the party?

19:12.992 --> 19:16.245
I was wrong.
Every kid wants a clown for a dad.

a little girl very happy.

I don't know what I was thinking with him.

You got flattered by the attention of a younger
guy and you got a little carried away.

19:47.851 --> 19:49.892
So what?
It's not that.

19:49.977 --> 19:54.272

like people are looking at me
saying, “You broke up the family.

have the guts to end it.

make it any easier.

This is such
a precious gift.

20:51.895 --> 20:54.190
I know. I can't believe my dad
sat down and did this.

20:54.272 --> 20:55.649
Keep going.

20:55.731 --> 20:58.067
[ Gloria ] Jay, pay attention.
It's your line.

20:58.151 --> 21:01.236
[ Jay ] I just had a damn line.
Manny, freshen this up for me.

21:01.362 --> 21:03.654
[ Ice Cubes Clinking ] [ Gloria ] No.
No more drinks until we finish this.

21:03.737 --> 21:06.281
[ Jay ] Who cares?
Cam is just gonna return it anyway.

21:06.406 --> 21:08.408
