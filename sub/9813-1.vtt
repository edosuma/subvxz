[Tom] <i>I love being a stand-up comedian.</i>

00:16.259 --> 00:18.878
<i>It's the best job in the world.</i>

00:19.888 --> 00:21.773
<i>And I love being an L.A. comic.</i>

00:21.807 --> 00:22.774
Bam!

00:22.808 --> 00:24.191
Alfred the assassin.

00:24.225 --> 00:28.738
<i>As a comic, what you're supposed to do
is live your life and report it.</i>

00:28.772 --> 00:30.573
[woman] Anytime I do
something nice for you,

00:30.607 --> 00:32.867
- you shit on me!
- When is that?!

00:32.901 --> 00:34.243
<i>I love the whole process.</i>

00:34.277 --> 00:35.828
[woman] You have a little dick.

00:35.862 --> 00:38.247
<i>Writing. Performing.</i>

00:38.281 --> 00:42.043
<i>Figuring out how to make a joke work.</i>

00:42.077 --> 00:44.378
<i>It's the best.</i>

00:44.412 --> 00:49.008
<i>But most of all,
I love meeting the people of this city.</i>

00:49.042 --> 00:52.303
<i>- They always inspire me.</i>
- [shouting] Hey!

00:52.337 --> 00:54.013
Tom Segura!

00:54.047 --> 00:57.433
Bite me in my ass, man! Aah!

00:57.467 --> 00:58.935
You have to do it!

00:58.969 --> 01:03.439
<i>I love them.
They have nothing but admiration for me.</i>

01:03.473 --> 01:05.024
[speaks foreign language]

01:05.058 --> 01:07.526
Yeah, after work we can do whatever, man.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.861
[speaks foreign language]

01:08.895 --> 01:12.157
<i>I just know there's no stopping us.</i>

01:12.191 --> 01:14.867
Hey! Who this fat-ass nigger right here?

01:14.901 --> 01:16.953
What's up, fat boy?

01:16.987 --> 01:20.165
- 'Sup?
- Making a food show, bitch?

01:20.199 --> 01:22.291
- No.
- You should.

01:22.325 --> 01:24.627
Bam! 'Cause you fat as fuck!

01:24.661 --> 01:26.879
This fat motherfucker right here, man.

01:26.913 --> 01:28.965
- You got pancake titties.
- You do!

01:28.999 --> 01:30.800
Fuck this city.
I'm re-shooting this thing.

01:30.834 --> 01:32.093
Eat a dick, Paul Blart.

[Tom] What up?

02:15.378 --> 02:18.848
Thank you! Thank you, guys.

02:18.882 --> 02:20.933
Thank you very much.

02:20.967 --> 02:24.229
It's great to be in Seattle.

02:24.263 --> 02:26.798
- [crowd roars]
- Yes.

02:28.975 --> 02:32.904
One of my favorite places,
and I am fucking falling apart.

02:32.938 --> 02:34.822
All right, um...

02:34.856 --> 02:38.034
I hate who I'm becoming, socially.

02:38.068 --> 02:40.245
Like, all my social interactions,

02:40.279 --> 02:43.330
I'm disintegrating into somebody
I want to punch in the mouth.

02:43.364 --> 02:48.127
Like, I start weather chats
with people all the time now,

02:48.161 --> 02:49.754
like, ugh.

02:49.788 --> 02:53.758
I got off the plane here, and the guy
that picks me up at the airport,

02:53.792 --> 02:57.095
I was like, "It rains a lot here, huh?"

02:57.129 --> 02:59.764
[laughter]

02:59.798 --> 03:02.808
And I swear,
there's another voice in my head going,

03:02.842 --> 03:04.977
"You're a piece of shit
for this conversation."

03:05.011 --> 03:07.605
[laughter]

03:07.639 --> 03:11.276
What's the guy supposed to say?
He's in the car and he's like, "Yeah..."

03:11.310 --> 03:13.736
[laughter]

03:13.770 --> 03:15.487
"...it does.

03:15.521 --> 03:19.099
And you're a real piece of shit for this,
just so you know."

03:20.401 --> 03:23.537
I wanted to abort,
I wanted to get out of it, but I couldn't.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.498
Like, "I'm from Southern California,
we sure could use it."

03:26.532 --> 03:29.276
- [chuckles]
- [laughter]

03:31.079 --> 03:34.423
And he was like,
"I'll run us off the fucking road.

03:34.457 --> 03:37.343
I'll kill us both,
I swear to God I will."

03:37.377 --> 03:39.804
God forbid I meet
a tall person now, like...

03:39.838 --> 03:41.555
If you're over six-four,

03:41.589 --> 03:45.268
there's no way I'm not addressing it.
I'm gonna be like,

03:45.302 --> 03:48.104
- "Wow, you're tall."
- [laughter]

03:48.138 --> 03:51.274
"Do you like basketball?
Yeah? Is that your thing?

03:51.308 --> 03:53.400
I have a friend that's tall."

03:53.434 --> 03:57.529
Dude, you just told a grown man
you have a fucking friend that's tall.

03:57.563 --> 04:02.076
Like, what's next? "My dad's super strong?

04:02.110 --> 04:05.496
- I bet he's stronger than your dad."
- [laughter]

04:05.530 --> 04:07.498
Ugh.

04:07.532 --> 04:09.959
It's better than
my dad's actual small talk,

04:09.993 --> 04:13.296
which is awkwardly racial small talk.

04:13.330 --> 04:17.007
It's not racist, but it involves race.
Um...

04:17.041 --> 04:22.012
Like, we're at a restaurant and, you know,
the server walks up and she's Asian.

04:22.047 --> 04:26.517
- My dad will be like, "You Chinese?"
- [laughter]

04:26.551 --> 04:29.103
And she's like, "No, I'm Korean."

04:29.137 --> 04:31.147
"Oh, I was in Vietnam."

04:31.181 --> 04:33.524
- And I'm like...
- [laughter]

04:33.558 --> 04:36.277
"What are you doing?"

04:36.311 --> 04:40.614
"What? I was." "I know.
What does that have to do with anything?"

04:40.648 --> 04:43.534
Then he goes, "Lot fewer of them
when I left, if you know what I mean."

04:43.568 --> 04:46.162
- I'm like, "Oh, man."
- [laughter]

04:46.196 --> 04:48.622
[whistles]
Well...

04:48.656 --> 04:52.459
"Yeah, it was two Diet Cokes,
we're gonna wrap it up pretty quick."

04:52.493 --> 04:56.839
Dude, if he meets a black guy,
shut it the fuck down, okay?

04:56.873 --> 04:59.800
'Cause, it's gonna get weird. Like...

04:59.834 --> 05:03.346
Dude, I see it. A black guy starts
talking to us and my dad'll be like...

05:03.380 --> 05:05.056
[laughter]

05:05.090 --> 05:07.599
I can see it in his eyes,
like a clock's ticking down.

05:07.633 --> 05:10.978
And I'm like, "How weird are you
about to be with him?"

05:11.012 --> 05:14.523
He looks like a dog, when you show a dog
a treat and you're like, "Sit still."

05:14.557 --> 05:16.025
And the dog's like...

05:16.059 --> 05:17.927
[laughter]

05:20.855 --> 05:22.156
"I work with a black guy!"

05:22.190 --> 05:25.617
- Ohh. Ohh.
- [laughter]

05:25.651 --> 05:27.578
Oh, man.

05:27.612 --> 05:30.706
"Yeah, Carl.
You know him? I don't know...

05:30.740 --> 05:33.584
Thought you knew each other.
I don't know.

05:33.618 --> 05:35.461
I don't know him.
He works in the building."

05:35.495 --> 05:38.714
You're like, "Fuck."

05:38.748 --> 05:40.658
Jesus.

05:41.751 --> 05:44.345
Speaking of dads, I'm gonna be a dad.
Isn't that crazy?

05:44.379 --> 05:46.972
[crowd cheers]

05:47.006 --> 05:48.582
I know. Well...

05:50.343 --> 05:53.562
You know, not my fucking problem.
You know what I mean? Um...

05:53.596 --> 05:55.689
- [laughter]
- That's your kid. So...

05:55.723 --> 05:58.692
No, I'm gonna stick around.
I wanna see what it looks and stuff.

05:58.726 --> 06:02.696
- [laughter]
- Just for a second. But...

06:02.730 --> 06:05.657
So crazy, man.
All I did was, I didn't pull out.

06:05.691 --> 06:07.743
- And then...
- [laughter]

06:07.777 --> 06:10.121
Now I'm gonna be a dad. So nuts.

06:10.155 --> 06:14.792
Isn't that crazy? As a man, all you do
is you dump inside of a girl and then...

06:14.826 --> 06:19.255
there's life? That's a pretty crude way
of putting that. I'm sorry. But...

06:19.289 --> 06:21.323
that's what happens.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.261
Let's just talk about how good
that feels. I...

06:25.295 --> 06:27.179
[laughter]

06:27.213 --> 06:30.891
Dude, I've been pulling out for <i>years.</i>

06:30.925 --> 06:33.560
And no comp... No orgasm...
You don't have an org...

06:33.594 --> 06:36.855
and you're like, "Oh, that sucks."
Like, it's still...

06:36.889 --> 06:40.943
It feels great.
But when you leave it in?

06:40.977 --> 06:41.944
Dude.

06:41.978 --> 06:44.263
[laughter]

06:45.273 --> 06:47.074
Here's all I'm saying.

06:47.108 --> 06:50.536
If you're a pull-out guy,
next time? Don't.

06:50.570 --> 06:53.580
[laughter]

06:53.614 --> 06:56.167
Even if she tells you to.
Be like, "I forgot."

06:56.201 --> 06:58.336
[laughter]

06:58.370 --> 06:59.670
And she'll whine about it.

06:59.704 --> 07:01.839
[whines]

07:01.873 --> 07:04.467
"What if I'm pregnant?

07:04.501 --> 07:07.178
My career!"

07:07.212 --> 07:11.557
And you'll be like,
"Is law school on hold? All right.

07:11.591 --> 07:13.725
Pretty sure you can cut hair with a gut."

07:13.759 --> 07:16.645
[mixed laughter]

07:16.679 --> 07:19.064
Guys! I'm joking. I'm joking.

07:19.098 --> 07:21.150
[laughter]

07:21.184 --> 07:23.552
- [crowd cheers]
- Joke.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.657
- I'm not joking. But...
- [laughter]

07:28.691 --> 07:31.869
God, it feels so good!

07:31.903 --> 07:36.582
I can't even... I can't even describe
how much better it feels.

07:36.616 --> 07:40.127
The best I've come up with is,
remember when you were a kid,

07:40.161 --> 07:42.713
and the first time you tried
something with melted cheese,

07:42.747 --> 07:45.966
- and you were like, "What the fuck?"
- [laughter]

07:46.000 --> 07:48.635
"This is the same thing?"
And they're like, "Same shit."

07:48.669 --> 07:50.596
And you're like, "This is amazing!

07:50.630 --> 07:53.349
I can have this whenever I want?"
"Mm-hm. Whenever you want.

07:53.383 --> 07:56.519
Just eight, ten seconds
and it's your world, man."

07:56.553 --> 07:57.978
You're like, "Oh, my God!"

07:58.012 --> 08:01.590
- It's like that, but down here.
- [laughter]

08:03.893 --> 08:06.737
Feels so good.

08:06.771 --> 08:09.198
Ohh. Here's what a piece of shit I am.

08:09.232 --> 08:10.324
I...

08:10.358 --> 08:13.327
I have been fantasizing a lot

08:13.361 --> 08:16.288
about people asking me

08:16.322 --> 08:19.500
how I lost the weight
that I haven't lost yet.

08:19.534 --> 08:21.335
[laughter]

08:21.369 --> 08:24.296
And, like, I just have so many answers.

08:24.330 --> 08:25.839
Like, I really enjoy doing...

08:25.873 --> 08:29.009
In my head, I'm like,
"Dude, it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle."

08:29.043 --> 08:30.802
[laughter]

08:30.836 --> 08:33.013
"Just gotta make smarter choices, man.

08:33.047 --> 08:36.683
I mean, drink more water.
Look at me, I've never felt better.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.352
I have so much energy.
If I can do it, you can do it."

08:39.386 --> 08:42.313
And then I eat chocolate soufflé,
as I have...

08:42.347 --> 08:45.192
- [imitates chewing sounds]
- [laughter]

08:45.226 --> 08:49.405
Like, "Well, next year I'll probably
be ready for this conversation."

08:49.439 --> 08:51.365
Fucking asshole.

08:51.399 --> 08:55.869
I don't even want to, like, lose weight
to live long or be healthy.

08:55.903 --> 08:59.123
I don't. I just want to be able
to make fun of fat people again.

08:59.157 --> 09:00.874
[laughter]

09:00.908 --> 09:03.335
And know for sure
that they're fatter than me.

09:03.369 --> 09:06.838
'Cause, like, sometimes...
Now I'm like anybody,

09:06.872 --> 09:09.300
I'll be like, "Look at this
fat fucking asshole."

09:09.334 --> 09:11.343
And someone'll be like,
"You're fatter."

09:11.377 --> 09:14.513
And I'm like, "Oh. Really?"
And they're like, "By a lot!"

09:14.547 --> 09:16.974
[laughter]

09:17.008 --> 09:21.003
"You should want his body."
And I'm like, "Ah, fuck, man."

09:23.306 --> 09:28.026
Since I'm gonna have a kid,
I don't want to be the fat dad.

09:28.060 --> 09:31.947
Remember when we were
in elementary school, in like fifth grade?

09:31.981 --> 09:34.950
You're like, "Hey,
look at Billy's fat fuckin' dad."

09:34.984 --> 09:37.620
[laughter]

09:37.654 --> 09:40.205
[chortles] "Fuckin'..."

09:40.239 --> 09:44.543
"Just fuckin' batter him up tonight
and eat him, huh, Billy's dad?"

09:44.577 --> 09:46.671
Just don't want to be that guy.

09:46.705 --> 09:48.297
I got a trainer.

09:48.331 --> 09:51.717
They gave me a trainer.
That's a better way of saying that.

09:51.751 --> 09:56.347
I joined a gym, and they go,
"Do you want a free training session?"

09:56.381 --> 09:59.099
I was like, "Okay.
What does it normally cost?"

09:59.133 --> 10:01.018
And they're like, "Like $900."

10:01.052 --> 10:03.145
I was like, "Wow, that's a great deal.
That's awesome."

10:03.179 --> 10:04.438
[crowd chuckles]

10:04.472 --> 10:07.983
The first session is a bait session.
It's ridiculous.

10:08.017 --> 10:09.652
The guy's like, "Stand up."

10:09.686 --> 10:12.613
Like, "Okay." He's like,
"Wow, you're a very powerful athlete."

10:12.647 --> 10:15.073
[laughter]

10:15.107 --> 10:16.742
"Were you pro before?"

10:16.776 --> 10:20.412
I'm like, "Okay, yes. I think I was."

10:20.446 --> 10:24.709
He goes, "You look like it. Your muscle
fibers look really great." I'm like...

10:24.743 --> 10:28.837
He's like, "Want to do this all the time?"
I'm like, "Yeah. Absolutely.

10:28.871 --> 10:31.840
This is a good boost for me.
I like this a lot."

10:31.874 --> 10:35.553
Second session, way different
than the first session.

10:35.587 --> 10:37.429
Second session, I'm doing burpies.

10:37.463 --> 10:40.558
Like, you jump on the ground
then you jump onto a wooden block.

10:40.592 --> 10:43.686
I'm running through sand pushing a sled.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.564
"And I go, is this SEAL school?
What are we doing right now?"

10:46.598 --> 10:48.065
[laughter]

10:48.099 --> 10:51.777
In the middle of this workout,
my trainer goes "Stop!"

10:51.811 --> 10:53.362
And I said, "Thank you."

10:53.396 --> 10:55.447
[laughter]

10:55.481 --> 10:57.324
He goes, "Know why I told you to stop?"

10:57.358 --> 11:00.536
And I go, "Yeah, so you don't
have to give me CPR, I think."

11:00.570 --> 11:01.746
[laughter]

11:01.780 --> 11:05.332
And he goes, "No. The Holy Spirit."

11:05.366 --> 11:06.500
"What?"

11:06.534 --> 11:09.169
[laughter]

11:09.203 --> 11:12.964
And he goes, "The Holy Spirit
told me to tell you to stop."

11:12.998 --> 11:14.633
And I go...

11:14.667 --> 11:17.886
"What...

11:17.920 --> 11:21.081
did I sign up for? What the fuck is this?"

11:22.425 --> 11:24.643
And he goes,
"Do you believe in Jesus Christ?"

11:24.677 --> 11:26.937
And I said, "Is He gonna
make me do push-ups?"

11:26.971 --> 11:30.274
[laughter]

11:30.308 --> 11:34.152
And that right there,
he got really mad at that. Like...

11:34.186 --> 11:36.488
really upset.
He was like, "It's not all jokes!"

11:36.522 --> 11:39.683
"I said one thing.
I can't say one thing? All right."

11:40.693 --> 11:43.662
And he tells me to take the big plate,
the 45-pound plate.

11:43.696 --> 11:46.582
"Hold it over your head
and run down to the pier and back."

11:46.616 --> 11:49.000
And the pier's, like,
three-quarters of a mile.

11:49.034 --> 11:50.544
And I go, "Nope."

11:50.578 --> 11:52.045
[laughter]

11:52.079 --> 11:53.547
"Not doing that."

11:53.581 --> 11:56.675
He's like, "You're quitting?
You're quitting on me?"

11:56.709 --> 12:00.554
And I go, "No,
I'm not quitting, it's just that...

12:00.588 --> 12:01.972
the Holy Spirit..."

12:02.006 --> 12:04.057
[laughter]

12:04.091 --> 12:06.602
"...it talks to me, too.

12:06.636 --> 12:08.479
And it said there's no way
I'm gonna make this run

12:08.513 --> 12:11.106
without throwing up
and people laughing at me.

12:11.140 --> 12:15.068
So, I'm gonna get a peanut butter
protein shake. I'm out, man."

12:15.102 --> 12:17.738
And I took off.

12:17.772 --> 12:19.323
I'm not doing that shit.

12:19.357 --> 12:22.075
I'm not making fun of you
if you're religious.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.952
I think that's great. Any faith.

12:23.986 --> 12:26.413
Christian, Muslim, Jew, what...

12:26.447 --> 12:29.625
If you're a Scientologist,
you can go fuck yourself. But...

12:29.659 --> 12:32.444
- [crowd cheers]
- Yeah.

12:35.039 --> 12:37.174
Because it's not old.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.843
It's gotta be old.

12:38.877 --> 12:40.678
[crowd chuckles]

12:40.712 --> 12:44.097
It's fair to say there's some times
I don't want to hear about it.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.891
You know? Like working out?

12:45.925 --> 12:48.935
Um... Getting high.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.479
That's a bummer.

12:50.513 --> 12:55.901
Right? Like, when there's
pills and cash and tits out and...

12:55.935 --> 12:58.987
someone's like, "Have you thought
about accepting the Lord into your life?"

12:59.021 --> 13:01.657
And you're like,
"I'm trying to make bad decisions.

13:01.691 --> 13:04.242
Why are you doing this to me?"

13:04.276 --> 13:06.453
That and pre-sex.

13:06.487 --> 13:08.163
That is the worst.

13:08.197 --> 13:10.248
During sex, <i>as-salamu alaykum.</i>

13:10.282 --> 13:13.001
- Anything goes. But...
- [laughter]

13:13.035 --> 13:15.170
Pre-sex? Like, right before,
and the girl's like,

13:15.204 --> 13:18.465
"Oh! What if God's watching us?"

13:18.499 --> 13:20.050
And you're like, "What?!"

13:20.084 --> 13:21.635
[laughter]

13:21.669 --> 13:23.679
"'What if God is watching us?'

13:23.713 --> 13:25.556
Of course He's watching us!

13:25.590 --> 13:29.100
He sees everything and this is
hands-down His favorite shit!"

13:29.134 --> 13:31.019
[laughter]

13:31.053 --> 13:32.604
[crowd cheering]

13:32.638 --> 13:34.423
Yeah.

13:37.101 --> 13:40.529
"Quit being a baby, put another knuckle
in there and let's give Him a show!"

13:40.563 --> 13:42.764
[laughter]

13:45.568 --> 13:47.436
[chuckles]

13:48.446 --> 13:51.289
[laughter]

13:51.323 --> 13:54.626
Digit play, it's fun. Get into it. But...

13:54.660 --> 13:56.503
let's be clear about this, guys.

13:56.537 --> 13:58.672
We're not gonna agree on everything. Okay?

13:58.706 --> 14:01.007
But we should agree on this.

14:01.041 --> 14:05.345
If you bring a baby
into a movie theater,

14:05.379 --> 14:06.597
you're a piece of shit.

14:06.631 --> 14:07.973
[crowd cheering]

14:08.007 --> 14:10.125
Yup.

14:13.679 --> 14:17.315
If your reason for doing it
is you couldn't get a babysitter,

14:17.349 --> 14:20.694
well, then,
you don't get to go to the movies.

14:20.728 --> 14:22.237
That's how that works.

14:22.271 --> 14:24.740
It happened to me in back-to-back movies,

14:24.774 --> 14:28.452
which statistically
I did not think was possible.

14:28.486 --> 14:30.662
First movie, I'm in there five minutes.

14:30.696 --> 14:34.040
I'm watching the movie and I hear,
"Waaah."

14:34.074 --> 14:35.542
"What?"

14:35.576 --> 14:36.752
I turn,

14:36.786 --> 14:41.089
and in the row behind me
there's a mother, a father and a baby.

14:41.123 --> 14:44.635
Not a child,
which I think is an important distinction.

14:44.669 --> 14:48.806
It's a baby. I'm like, "All right,
these people are insane. Um...

14:48.840 --> 14:50.432
I'll just ignore this."

14:50.466 --> 14:54.060
Turn back, 30 seconds later,
"Waah."

14:54.094 --> 14:56.021
I'm like,
"Well, now I have to say something."

14:56.055 --> 14:57.481
Now...

14:57.515 --> 14:58.732
I'm polite.

14:58.766 --> 15:01.276
So I turn and I go, "Excuse me,

15:01.310 --> 15:03.528
are you stabbing your baby right now?"

15:03.562 --> 15:05.823
[laughter]

15:05.857 --> 15:08.158
"'Cause it sounds like it."

15:08.192 --> 15:11.578
And the dad goes...
[heavy accent] "No, I love the baby."

15:11.612 --> 15:13.538
- You picture him, okay?
- [laughter]

15:13.572 --> 15:16.041
"I love him. <i>Pero...</i>

15:16.075 --> 15:17.292
no.

15:17.326 --> 15:20.211
It's my baby."

15:20.245 --> 15:24.675
And I said, "Well, could you?
'Cause I'm trying to watch this movie."

15:24.709 --> 15:26.760
[laughter]

15:26.794 --> 15:28.887
"And...

15:28.921 --> 15:31.056
your baby's ruining it."

15:31.090 --> 15:33.308
He's like, "No, no <i>puedo.</i>" So...

15:33.342 --> 15:35.185
[laughter]

15:35.219 --> 15:37.354
I get up, I go to the lobby,

15:37.388 --> 15:40.065
I see the manager
of the theater and I go, "Hey!

15:40.099 --> 15:44.569
There's a fucking baby in there...

15:44.603 --> 15:47.280
being a baby right now."

15:47.314 --> 15:51.743
And the manager goes,
"Some people suck."

15:51.777 --> 15:54.162
And he walked away.

15:54.196 --> 15:57.833
That is the best customer service line
I've ever heard in my life.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.292
Hands down.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.779
[cheers and applause]

16:02.914 --> 16:04.965
You can't even get mad!

16:04.999 --> 16:07.634
If you're in a restaurant,
been waiting on your food, like,

16:07.668 --> 16:10.136
"Where the fuck is my food?
I've been here half an hour!"

16:10.170 --> 16:12.222
And the manager's like,
"Some people suck." Like,

16:12.256 --> 16:16.852
"Oh yeah. Some people suck.
I didn't think about it. My bad.

16:16.886 --> 16:19.063
Sorry about that."

16:19.097 --> 16:20.355
I left. I left.

16:20.389 --> 16:22.649
The next day, I go back to the movies.

16:22.683 --> 16:25.443
I should point out I saw
a different movie.

16:25.477 --> 16:27.153
It was also a different baby.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.532
It's not the same family
standing out front

16:30.566 --> 16:34.578
and then they see me and they're like,
"Oh, there he is. Let's go inside...

16:34.612 --> 16:37.581
and ruin this for him again."

16:37.615 --> 16:41.376
This time I am way further into the movie.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.712
I'm emotionally invested in this movie.

16:43.746 --> 16:45.130
I like the movie.

16:45.164 --> 16:49.885
And then, out of nowhere, I hear,
"Waah."

16:49.919 --> 16:53.304
This time, I swear to you, I audibly go,

16:53.338 --> 16:54.598
"Nuh-uh."

16:54.632 --> 16:57.893
[laughter]

16:57.927 --> 17:00.645
And now, other people get involved.

17:00.679 --> 17:04.733
You know when you can hear
somebody's age in their voice?

17:04.767 --> 17:08.278
Like, I can't see shit.
It's a dark theater.

17:08.311 --> 17:12.950
I just hear a guy go,
"Either make it quiet or get it out!"

17:12.983 --> 17:15.602
[laughter]

17:18.823 --> 17:20.749
That guy's 140 years old!

17:20.782 --> 17:22.666
[laughter]

17:22.701 --> 17:25.377
Like, I could hear
that he'd never hugged his children.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.071
- I could hear it in his voice.
- [laughter]

17:32.628 --> 17:36.181
This time,
the mother of the baby goes,

17:36.215 --> 17:38.266
"Shut up."

17:38.300 --> 17:42.020
- And I was like, "Oh shit!" Like...
- [laughter]

17:42.054 --> 17:44.940
"We have a situation."

17:44.974 --> 17:50.779
And then a third person goes, "Shh."

17:50.813 --> 17:52.948
[laughter]

17:52.982 --> 17:56.868
What are you doing?
"Shush" is passive-aggressive.

17:56.902 --> 17:59.746
She said, "Shut up."
Just go straight to "fuck you!"

17:59.780 --> 18:01.899
What are you doing?

18:03.701 --> 18:07.587
But now... I wanted to be
the hero and save the movie.

18:07.621 --> 18:09.673
I felt a tremendous sense of injustice.

18:09.707 --> 18:12.843
Like, all these movies
are being ruined by babies, but...

18:12.877 --> 18:17.347
I didn't realize I was too angry
in that moment to um, what is it?

18:17.381 --> 18:20.058
Speak English words in a sentence.

18:20.092 --> 18:22.853
You know when you get real rage,
like... [barks]

18:22.887 --> 18:24.771
- Like, just...
- [crowd chuckles]

18:24.805 --> 18:26.148
"Dude..."

18:26.182 --> 18:28.608
- [barks] Like...
- [laughter]

18:28.642 --> 18:29.860
[growls]

18:29.894 --> 18:33.571
Like, you feel it,
your throat dries out, and... aah!

18:33.605 --> 18:37.450
So I stood up in the theater
with the best intentions and I went...

18:37.484 --> 18:41.287
"Why is everybody
not in the adult movie?!"

18:41.321 --> 18:43.648
- Like none of it made sense.
- [laughter]

18:45.993 --> 18:49.738
Everybody's like, "Who's that fucking guy?
What's his problem?"

18:51.290 --> 18:52.716
I was...

18:52.750 --> 18:56.761
I was trying to say,
"Let's be civilized adults."

18:56.795 --> 19:00.557
But instead I went "adult movie."

19:00.591 --> 19:03.393
"Porn's on now.

19:03.427 --> 19:04.853
Cover your baby's eyes."

19:04.887 --> 19:06.880
[laughter]

19:08.015 --> 19:11.235
The next thing,
I see a white T-shirt pop up

19:11.269 --> 19:13.929
and I'm like,
"Well, there's the dad."

19:15.647 --> 19:16.948
[laughter]

19:16.982 --> 19:19.267
Some of you got it. And...

19:20.819 --> 19:23.038
He looked around, like,
"Who's talking shit?"

19:23.072 --> 19:26.457
And I was like, "I'm talking shit, bitch."

19:26.491 --> 19:28.793
I didn't say it,
but he knew what was up. But then...

19:28.827 --> 19:30.545
[laughter]

19:30.579 --> 19:32.172
I went out the exit immediately

19:32.206 --> 19:36.284
cause I'm not getting my ass kicked
over <i>The Lego Movie, </i> so I left.

19:38.462 --> 19:40.998
[cheering]

19:50.933 --> 19:53.526
You guys,
are you ever just

19:53.560 --> 19:56.029
tired of being alive?

19:56.063 --> 19:58.740
- Know what I mean? Like...
- [crowd chuckles]

19:58.774 --> 20:00.784
I'm not suicidal.

20:00.818 --> 20:05.538
I just feel like I've done a lot
and I've seen a lot. And now I'm like,

20:05.572 --> 20:08.250
- "Let's wrap this shit up. Like..."
- [laughter]

20:08.284 --> 20:11.211
Right? Like, how many
fucking days are there?

20:11.245 --> 20:13.530
[laughter]

20:16.750 --> 20:19.677
I want to skip a grade. Remember...

20:19.711 --> 20:22.764
elementary school, and you get
to the first day of,

20:22.798 --> 20:25.558
whatever, third grade,
and you're like, "Where's Brian?"

20:25.592 --> 20:29.479
They're like, "He skipped."
"Excuse me? How?"

20:29.513 --> 20:33.108
They're like, "He can add like
a motherfucker. I don't know. He just...

20:33.142 --> 20:37.195
- Four, eight, twelve. He gets it."
- [laughter]

20:37.229 --> 20:42.033
And then you go, "I want to skip."
And they're like... [chuckling]

20:42.067 --> 20:45.228
"Don't even think about that.
Think about other shit."

20:46.364 --> 20:47.956
I'd love to skip in real life.

20:47.990 --> 20:50.416
That would be the best program,
if they were like,

20:50.450 --> 20:53.378
"If you kill it this year,
you have the best year,

20:53.412 --> 20:56.547
at the end of the year, a magical fairy

20:56.581 --> 20:59.801
or government official
will come to your house...

20:59.835 --> 21:02.387
and they go, 'You crushed it this year.'"

21:02.421 --> 21:05.390
- And you're like, "I know."
- [crowd chuckles]

21:05.424 --> 21:07.976
Then they're like, "Now you can skip
as many years as you want."

21:08.010 --> 21:10.728
I'd be like, "What the fuck?!

21:10.762 --> 21:12.981
Really?" "Mm-hmm.
How many do you want to skip?"

21:13.015 --> 21:15.066
"Thirty?"

21:15.100 --> 21:16.651
Just land at retirement.

21:16.685 --> 21:18.987
I don't wanna live
much longer than that anyways.

21:19.021 --> 21:21.281
Seventy. Maybe 71. You know?

21:21.315 --> 21:25.160
Seventy so I can be "officially old"
and experience old guy stuff,

21:25.194 --> 21:28.663
like people talking to me like I'm a pet,
and, um...

21:28.697 --> 21:29.747
[laughter]

21:29.781 --> 21:33.543
You ever see that? When they're like,
"Hey, hey. How you doing?

21:33.577 --> 21:36.546
You're so good.
Would you like me to get you anything?"

21:36.580 --> 21:40.384
Like, "Yeah. Put some water in my bowl.
What the fuck is this shit?" Like...

21:40.418 --> 21:43.261
[laughter]

21:43.295 --> 21:45.471
But I don't want
to live much longer than that.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.141
I mean, I hear people in conversation go,

21:48.175 --> 21:49.934
"I want to live to be a hundred."

21:49.968 --> 21:51.186
Really?

21:51.220 --> 21:52.854
Have you seen 80?

21:52.888 --> 21:56.566
I mean,
my dad has a friend that's 87.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.278
- He looks like a goblin. Okay?
- [laughter]

22:00.312 --> 22:03.114
He is terrifying to look at.

22:03.148 --> 22:04.074
And he knows it.

22:04.108 --> 22:07.577
He's like, "I'm coming around the corner.
Don't look at me." He knows it.

22:07.611 --> 22:10.688
- [laughter]
- It's scary.

22:12.032 --> 22:14.084
Here's how much it sucks to be that old.

22:14.118 --> 22:19.005
When he was 84,
he stopped taking his heart medication.

22:19.039 --> 22:22.342
And I go, "Why did you do that?"
And he goes, "I don't want to be here."

22:22.376 --> 22:24.077
[laughter]

22:25.463 --> 22:27.722
If you see him now,
you're like, "How you doing?"

22:27.756 --> 22:31.101
- "Unfortunately, alive."
- [laughter]

22:31.135 --> 22:32.477
"But He won't take me."

22:32.511 --> 22:34.354
[laughter]

22:34.388 --> 22:36.981
The only thing I have
going for me with that old stuff

22:37.015 --> 22:39.609
is that I will be the best old guy.

22:39.643 --> 22:42.195
I already know it.
Like, I have their personality.

22:42.229 --> 22:43.863
I'm anti-social as shit.

22:43.897 --> 22:46.532
I don't want to do anything. Like...

22:46.566 --> 22:50.328
whenever anybody says to me, "Hey, man.
Do you wanna go check out the..."

22:50.362 --> 22:55.959
I go, "No to the rest of your sentence.
Whatever it is, I don't want to do it."

22:55.993 --> 22:57.419
I don't want to meet new people.

22:57.453 --> 23:00.630
Not one more, as long as I live,
for the rest of my life.

23:00.664 --> 23:01.923
That's the same as old people.

23:01.957 --> 23:04.259
Try it if you want.
Be like, "Hey, Grandpa!

23:04.293 --> 23:07.137
I want you to meet Steve."
And he'll go, "Fuck Steve."

23:07.171 --> 23:08.972
[laughter]

23:09.006 --> 23:11.682
"I know everybody I need to know.

23:11.716 --> 23:13.810
Gonna watch my shows."
[blows raspberry]

23:13.844 --> 23:15.645
[laughter]

23:15.679 --> 23:17.730
Know what I really want?
I want to be that old...

23:17.764 --> 23:20.442
I don't know if it's an age,
it's just a way of being old.

23:20.476 --> 23:21.943
There's a certain level of old

23:21.977 --> 23:24.654
where you get yelled at
for trying to be helpful.

23:24.688 --> 23:27.615
That looks awesome.

23:27.649 --> 23:31.495
Know what I mean? When an old guy's like,
"I'm gonna take out the trash."

23:31.529 --> 23:34.872
And someone's like,
"Are you out of your fucking mind?

23:34.906 --> 23:37.875
Your spine'll snap. Sit down!"

23:37.909 --> 23:40.795
- "Okay."
- [laughter]

23:40.829 --> 23:42.172
"I tried. I'm sorry."

23:42.206 --> 23:44.466
[laughter]

23:44.500 --> 23:47.177
That looks amazing.

23:47.211 --> 23:53.266
I really want that old guy confidence
that I see...

23:53.300 --> 23:55.685
in the locker room.
Yeah. That's another thing.

23:55.719 --> 23:57.020
[laughter]

23:57.054 --> 24:00.524
Dude. Another thing I've noticed
since joining the gym,

24:00.558 --> 24:02.108
there's two types of guys:

24:02.142 --> 24:06.404
Guys that are 65 and older,
and then guys that cover their dicks.

24:06.438 --> 24:08.532
Because old guys...

24:08.566 --> 24:10.408
do not.

24:10.442 --> 24:12.869
It's crazy!

24:12.903 --> 24:15.246
The first few days,
I thought it was peacocking.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.747
Like showing off, you know?

24:16.781 --> 24:18.249
'Cause I saw some fucking hammers

24:18.283 --> 24:21.002
where you walk in
and you're like, "Whoa, yeah!"

24:21.036 --> 24:22.337
[laughter]

24:22.371 --> 24:24.630
"I wouldn't wear pants either.
Nice work, pal."

24:24.664 --> 24:26.866
[laughter]

24:28.001 --> 24:30.636
But then, like the third day,
I saw a guy,

24:30.670 --> 24:33.931
he had just like the cutest little thing.

24:33.965 --> 24:35.141
[laughter]

24:35.175 --> 24:37.060
And he was just like
all on the...

24:37.094 --> 24:40.730
He was like,
"Oil prices are crazy right now."

24:40.764 --> 24:42.148
[laughter]

24:42.182 --> 24:46.027
I'm like, "Dude, you have a little grain
of rice. You don't give a shit?"

24:46.061 --> 24:48.154
He didn't. He didn't care.

24:48.188 --> 24:50.907
I want that confidence.

24:50.941 --> 24:52.325
I don't even know how it's attainable.

24:52.359 --> 24:56.187
Like, if I know anyone's gonna see it,
I'm gonna... you know?

24:57.406 --> 24:59.583
[laughter]

24:59.617 --> 25:00.875
Give it a smack.

25:00.909 --> 25:02.986
[laughter]

25:04.288 --> 25:06.590
And then you go, "Huh. There's an inch."

25:06.624 --> 25:09.075
[laughter]

25:10.127 --> 25:14.331
Let's not act like I'm the only
self-fluffer in the room, okay?

25:16.383 --> 25:18.684
Dude.

25:18.718 --> 25:22.606
Ladies, if you've ever
received a dick-pic before, um,

25:22.640 --> 25:25.983
here's some secret intel:
That's not the first shot.

25:26.017 --> 25:28.653
[laughter]

25:28.687 --> 25:31.030
Pretty much goes like this: Click.

25:31.064 --> 25:34.309
- "Fuck that." And then...
- [laughter]

25:35.777 --> 25:39.272
"Oh, yeah, that's me.
That's all me right there. That's me."

25:41.741 --> 25:44.461
God, sweating my fucking balls off.

25:44.495 --> 25:46.087
Like a preacher. Amen.

25:46.121 --> 25:49.924
- All right. So...
- [laughter]

25:49.958 --> 25:51.659
Ha!

25:54.171 --> 25:55.305
This is a very... I think this...

25:55.339 --> 25:59.976
Pretty girls. Pretty town. A lot
of good-looking girls in this town. Um...

26:00.010 --> 26:01.978
I noticed, stylistically,

26:02.012 --> 26:04.855
I feel like a lot of girls here
have nose rings,

26:04.889 --> 26:07.484
and I have to tell you, I fucking dig it.

26:07.518 --> 26:08.943
Yeah.

26:08.977 --> 26:10.194
I like a girl with a nose ring.

26:10.228 --> 26:12.405
I think it says something.
I think it says,

26:12.439 --> 26:16.742
- "I have other piercings, and..."
- [crowd chuckling]

26:16.776 --> 26:20.037
- "...you can see them."
- [laughter]

26:20.071 --> 26:22.582
"As soon as I get this hemp bra off."

26:22.616 --> 26:25.502
- But...
- [laughter]

26:25.536 --> 26:28.546
Eyebrow ring, that's another level.

26:28.580 --> 26:30.173
That is a statement.

26:30.207 --> 26:33.468
And that statement is:
"Fisting is my first base."

26:33.502 --> 26:37.639
Like, those chicks
are fuckin' <i>down. </i> Am I right?

26:37.673 --> 26:40.808
- [crowd cheering]
- Yeah.

26:40.842 --> 26:42.602
Oh, yeah.

26:42.636 --> 26:44.270
Some of you... No?
I'm seeing disappointment

26:44.304 --> 26:46.856
in some people's faces, for sure.

26:46.890 --> 26:48.483
Yeah. Some people are like, "Mm-mm."

26:48.517 --> 26:50.443
[laughter]

26:50.477 --> 26:53.488
"Didn't sign up for this shit. No, sir."

26:53.522 --> 26:58.326
And the rest of you are like,
"But... But, Tom!

26:58.360 --> 27:02.997
What about tongue rings?
What about tongue rings, Tom?"

27:03.031 --> 27:04.499
What <i>about </i> them?!

27:04.533 --> 27:06.042
[laughter]

27:06.076 --> 27:07.860
Tools of the trade.

27:09.079 --> 27:12.840
Did Rembrandt not have a paintbrush?

27:12.874 --> 27:16.260
[laughter]

27:16.294 --> 27:19.472
Who is Beethoven without his piano?

27:19.506 --> 27:23.601
That girl has a tongue ring 'cause
her mouth is a homing device for cocks!

27:23.635 --> 27:26.896
[laughter]

27:26.930 --> 27:30.316
You leave her alone!

27:30.350 --> 27:32.777
Or just show her your dick.
There's a pretty good chance

27:32.811 --> 27:35.572
she's gonna lap that shit up.
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

27:35.606 --> 27:38.074
[laughter]

27:38.108 --> 27:41.478
Don't get upset.
It's silly. It's a silly joke.

27:42.613 --> 27:44.497
Look, I'm not a misogynistic pig.

27:44.531 --> 27:47.751
I think women should judge men
equally and harshly.

27:47.785 --> 27:49.085
You know what never fails?

27:49.119 --> 27:51.629
Judge men based on what they drive.

27:51.663 --> 27:53.130
Ladies...

27:53.164 --> 27:56.384
if a guy picks you up
in a minivan,

27:56.418 --> 27:58.010
he is telling you,

27:58.044 --> 28:02.348
"Why have sex when we can collect
all the <i>Angry Birds</i> stuffed animals?"

28:02.382 --> 28:04.542
[laughter]

28:08.346 --> 28:11.023
Full-size van. Whoa.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.983
[laughter]

28:13.017 --> 28:14.151
That's more like,

28:14.185 --> 28:16.946
"You wanna go out?
Well, you're coming."

28:16.980 --> 28:19.807
[laughter]

28:20.818 --> 28:23.745
Kidnapping joke, yeah?

28:23.779 --> 28:27.123
Now, ladies, if a guy picks you up
in a Honda and it's lowered,

28:27.157 --> 28:30.501
real low, low... to the ground...

28:30.535 --> 28:33.463
and there's some
cool blue lights underneath it,

28:33.497 --> 28:36.591
that says, "When we get
to this restaurant, get whatever you want.

28:36.625 --> 28:39.093
My mom's got this.
Don't worry about it. I got it. Yeah."

28:39.127 --> 28:42.054
- [laughter]
- "Yeah."

28:42.088 --> 28:44.957
"Yeah, she gave me tip money. Yeah!"

28:46.551 --> 28:47.477
Oh, man.

28:47.511 --> 28:51.021
I was in, uh, London...

28:51.055 --> 28:52.106
Canada.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.609
- Um, they have one.
- [crowd chuckles]

28:54.643 --> 28:55.985
And...

28:56.019 --> 28:58.195
Doesn't that kinda bother you?
A little bit?

28:58.229 --> 29:02.533
When a barely city is like,
"Let's name it after an awesome city."

29:02.567 --> 29:06.120
- [laughter]
- [snickers]

29:06.154 --> 29:09.081
And they have the nerve to ask you,
"How do you like London?"

29:09.115 --> 29:12.293
"The real one, or this turd
you put in a dress? Because..."

29:12.327 --> 29:13.753
[laughter]

29:13.787 --> 29:17.381
Like, the fucking balls
on Paris, Tennessee,

29:17.415 --> 29:20.593
to name their city Paris?

29:20.627 --> 29:23.763
And then they built a mini Eiffel Tower?

29:23.797 --> 29:26.223
Like you're gonna walk around confused,

29:26.257 --> 29:29.393
like, "Well, <i>bonjour!</i>
I don't even know where I'm at!"

29:29.427 --> 29:32.213
[laughter, cheering]

29:35.350 --> 29:37.735
"Can I get me a 'crassant?'"
[chortles]

29:37.769 --> 29:40.738
[laughter]

29:40.772 --> 29:42.973
Fuck Paris, Tennessee.

29:44.609 --> 29:47.995
So, we're leaving...

29:48.029 --> 29:50.373
London, Ontario, Canada...

29:50.407 --> 29:51.708
bothers me just to say it.

29:51.742 --> 29:55.336
And we're headed back to Toronto,

29:55.370 --> 29:59.382
and we pass by a strip club named Beef.

29:59.416 --> 30:01.300
- Now...
- [crowd chuckles]

30:01.334 --> 30:04.011
Yeah, your hearing is working just fine.

30:04.045 --> 30:05.722
[laughter]

30:05.756 --> 30:08.516
There's a strip club named Beef! I mean...

30:08.550 --> 30:13.604
can you even wrap your head around
the confidence a young lady has to have

30:13.638 --> 30:16.691
just to audition at Beef?

30:16.725 --> 30:21.028
Just to be like, "I know they're hiring
at Diamonds, but I'm more of a Beef girl."

30:21.062 --> 30:22.988
- Like, that is...
- [laughter]

30:23.022 --> 30:27.117
It's such an aggressive name,
even for a casual conversation.

30:27.151 --> 30:29.161
To be like, "Oh, you strip?"

30:29.195 --> 30:30.955
"Where do you strip at?"
"Beef."

30:30.989 --> 30:32.540
[laughter]

30:32.574 --> 30:35.292
- "Jesus."
- [laughter]

30:35.326 --> 30:39.213
"What goes on there?"
"Pretty intense shit, actually.

30:39.247 --> 30:43.175
We recommend you start
your night at a different strip club

30:43.209 --> 30:47.346
and graduate to Beef.
You start here, we'll wreck your life."

30:47.380 --> 30:49.432
Like, "All right. God."

30:49.466 --> 30:51.100
Fuckin' Beef is the name...

30:51.134 --> 30:54.545
Fart is a better name for a strip club.

30:56.264 --> 30:58.691
If somebody was like,
"You wanna go to a strip club?

30:58.725 --> 31:01.360
It's called Fart." I'd be like,
"No, I don't want to go there."

31:01.394 --> 31:04.488
"There's another one called Beef."
"All right, let's check out Fart."

31:04.522 --> 31:06.240
[laughter]

31:06.274 --> 31:07.975
"See where that ends up."

31:12.363 --> 31:14.707
I feel like...

31:14.741 --> 31:18.920
the worst part, honestly,
of traveling in our country

31:18.954 --> 31:20.922
is that there's no surprises.

31:20.956 --> 31:23.549
I swear to you, I travel every week,

31:23.583 --> 31:26.010
and it's really a disappointment.

31:26.044 --> 31:30.347
Every place is exactly
what I thought it was going to be.

31:30.381 --> 31:31.933
You know?
I can prove it to you.

31:31.967 --> 31:35.144
Picture a place you've never been to
in this country. Picture it.

31:35.178 --> 31:36.520
That's exactly how it is.

31:36.554 --> 31:38.773
[laughter]

31:38.807 --> 31:40.775
What are the people like, you wonder?

31:40.809 --> 31:42.693
What do you think they're like?

31:42.727 --> 31:43.861
That's right.

31:43.895 --> 31:46.530
[laughter]

31:46.564 --> 31:47.991
It's... I swear to you!

31:48.025 --> 31:51.368
Go to San Francisco.
They're like, "Ah, we're offended."

31:51.402 --> 31:52.870
And you're like, "Yep."

31:52.904 --> 31:54.747
[laughter]

31:54.781 --> 31:57.207
"I know."

31:57.241 --> 31:59.585
Texas? I don't think the people of Texas

31:59.619 --> 32:02.839
necessarily <i>want</i>
to execute retarded people,

32:02.873 --> 32:07.343
but I think they're like, "You know what?
This is Texas. So... whoo!"

32:07.377 --> 32:09.512
[laughter]

32:09.546 --> 32:12.682
"That's how we do it around here, brother.
A little boot scoot boop!

32:12.716 --> 32:14.433
See you later, dumdum.
All right."

32:14.467 --> 32:16.753
[laughter]

32:18.596 --> 32:21.816
They've done it multiple times!

32:21.850 --> 32:23.943
They keep doing it.

32:23.977 --> 32:26.654
"I'm sowwy."
"Yeah, me too."

32:26.688 --> 32:29.073
[laughter]

32:29.107 --> 32:30.891
Crazy.

32:33.486 --> 32:35.872
The Midwest?
I mean, don't you feel like

32:35.906 --> 32:38.374
we could draw a circle
around the Midwest and be like,

32:38.408 --> 32:41.919
- "Do we need this?"
- [laughter]

32:41.953 --> 32:45.965
Except for wherever you're from.
That place is fucking awesome.

32:45.999 --> 32:49.927
The Northeast,
shady fucking people in shady cities.

32:49.961 --> 32:51.470
That's all they are. Just shady.

32:51.504 --> 32:54.724
Just fucking all those places.
Jersey, Philly, Balti... they're all...

32:54.758 --> 32:57.810
- [chortles]
- [laughter]

32:57.844 --> 33:00.229
"How you doing?"
"Not now, thank you very much."

33:00.263 --> 33:01.814
[laughter]

33:01.848 --> 33:05.760
"Can I help you with something?"
"Nope. Never in my life."

33:07.562 --> 33:10.322
The one quality I do love
about Northeastern people, though,

33:10.356 --> 33:14.035
you could be in an argument with them
and be like, "You're a fucking asshole."

33:14.069 --> 33:17.329
- And they're like, "Thank you."
- [laughter]

33:17.363 --> 33:21.125
"My dad's an asshole, and so am I.
It's kind of a thing."

33:21.159 --> 33:23.961
Then what? You head, uh...

33:23.995 --> 33:25.337
you head on down south.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.839
[chuckles]

33:26.873 --> 33:28.591
[laughter]

33:28.625 --> 33:30.801
[Southern accent]
Where "God don't make no junk."

33:30.835 --> 33:32.845
[snickers]

33:32.879 --> 33:34.847
That's a real expression, by the way:

33:34.881 --> 33:37.391
"God don't make no junk."

33:37.425 --> 33:39.602
They say it a lot.
I lived there for a while.

33:39.636 --> 33:43.522
They say it to people who are
complaining about their own situation.

33:43.556 --> 33:45.942
So essentially, it's a pick-me-up. Right?

33:45.976 --> 33:50.404
Like, some lady might go,
"I ain't purty!"

33:50.438 --> 33:52.489
[laughter]

33:52.523 --> 33:55.451
"And I ain't no good."

33:55.485 --> 33:58.162
[crowd chuckling]

33:58.196 --> 34:01.398
"No one's ever gonna love me."
[moans]

34:02.450 --> 34:06.170
And someone'll go,
"Don't you talk that mess."

34:06.204 --> 34:08.172
[crowd chuckles]

34:08.206 --> 34:12.802
"Don't you say that, Sally...
Billy Bob... Sandra. Don't you say that."

34:12.835 --> 34:15.471
[laughter]

34:15.505 --> 34:18.623
"God don't make no junk."

34:20.135 --> 34:24.105
I always want to interrupt and be like,
"I'd like to politely disagree!"

34:24.139 --> 34:26.482
[laughter]

34:26.516 --> 34:28.692
"I think He was nodding off
when He made you."

34:28.726 --> 34:30.444
[laughter]

34:30.478 --> 34:35.158
"While your sunken eyes
and protruding underbite are charming..."

34:35.192 --> 34:37.601
[laughter]

34:39.946 --> 34:44.041
"...that map of white trash is not sending
a lot of lead to the pencil. You're right!

34:44.074 --> 34:47.543
You're gonna die alone,
bah-bah-bah-Nascar-fart-beer."

34:47.578 --> 34:51.215
[laughter, cheers]

34:51.248 --> 34:52.925
"You big box of stupid."

34:52.958 --> 34:55.803
[laughter]

34:55.837 --> 34:59.182
Here's great travel advice, okay?

34:59.216 --> 35:02.226
Do not take the red-eye.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.978
If you don't know what that is,

35:04.012 --> 35:07.857
it's amazing
that you made it this far in life.

35:07.891 --> 35:10.317
It's when you fly overnight

35:10.351 --> 35:13.237
from the West Coast
to the Eastern time zone.

35:13.271 --> 35:15.114
Some people love that flight.

35:15.148 --> 35:18.159
And those people are sociopaths.

35:18.193 --> 35:20.619
- Because... here's why.
- [laughter]

35:20.653 --> 35:24.081
You land and your body's like,
"Well, it's 3:30 in the morning.

35:24.115 --> 35:26.959
I guess we're going to sleep."
And then the world goes...

35:26.993 --> 35:29.419
- "Uh... nope!"
- [laughter]

35:29.453 --> 35:32.756
"6:30, dickhead!
Get ready to do stuff."

35:32.790 --> 35:35.509
And then you cry for days.

35:35.543 --> 35:37.928
Last one I ever went on,
I boarded with my wife.

35:37.962 --> 35:40.514
We get on, she looks
at our boarding passes, she goes,

35:40.548 --> 35:43.600
"We're not sitting next to each other."
And I go, "Okay."

35:43.634 --> 35:45.878
[laughter]

35:47.513 --> 35:49.273
I don't know.

35:49.307 --> 35:51.358
She goes,
"You don't wanna switch seats?"

35:51.392 --> 35:53.027
And I go, "Not really."

35:53.061 --> 35:54.528
[laughter]

35:54.562 --> 35:57.948
And she goes, "Why not?"
I said, "'Cause we don't have to."

35:57.982 --> 35:59.033
She goes, "What does that mean?"

35:59.067 --> 36:02.578
I said, "Well, there's only two people
that have to sit next to each other,

36:02.612 --> 36:04.205
and they're up front."

36:04.239 --> 36:07.733
[laughter, applause]

36:08.868 --> 36:10.861
"We can sit anywhere."

36:12.163 --> 36:14.339
She goes, "You're gonna ask
people to move."

36:14.373 --> 36:17.593
And I was like,
"Great. Should be a real treat."

36:17.627 --> 36:19.678
That's always fun, right?
"You all settled in?

36:19.712 --> 36:22.806
- Want to stand the fuck up now?" Great.
- [laughter]

36:22.840 --> 36:25.350
So...

36:25.384 --> 36:28.729
we're both window seats.
We need an aisle to move.

36:28.763 --> 36:33.276
So I go to the guy sitting next to her,
and this guy is old.

36:33.310 --> 36:35.986
I don't know how old,
but it doesn't look good.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.488
He's... he's drooling... [grunts]

36:38.522 --> 36:40.783
...he's got rubber where
there used to be bones...

36:40.817 --> 36:41.992
Put it this way:

36:42.026 --> 36:45.746
- It's his last flight. All right? So...
- [laughter]

36:45.780 --> 36:48.249
After this one, <i>no más.</i>

36:48.283 --> 36:49.333
[crowd chuckles]

36:49.367 --> 36:52.295
So I go, "Excuse me, Gandalf.
Do you think that..."

36:52.329 --> 36:53.963
[laughter]

36:53.997 --> 36:57.049
"...you could move
so I can sit next to my wife?"

36:57.083 --> 36:59.509
And he goes, "Move?"

36:59.543 --> 37:01.804
"Mm-hmm."

37:01.838 --> 37:03.889
He goes, "<i>You </i> move."

37:03.923 --> 37:06.183
- "Yep."
- [crowd chuckles]

37:06.217 --> 37:10.354
"I'll move here,
and then you move there."

37:10.388 --> 37:12.689
And he goes, "You can't see a meniscus...

37:12.723 --> 37:15.734
[gibberish]

37:15.768 --> 37:18.654
...I won't be able
to stretch out as much.

37:18.688 --> 37:22.325
[mumbling] I can't stretch.
I gotta sit by the aisle access

37:22.359 --> 37:24.743
and stretch it out there
so it's built up more.

37:24.777 --> 37:27.746
It'll be seven, eight times more
if I sit over there."

37:27.780 --> 37:30.333
And I go, "Are you reading me
a fucking novel about this?"

37:30.367 --> 37:32.417
[laughter]

37:32.451 --> 37:34.753
"Jesus, just say no!

37:34.787 --> 37:38.090
And I hope you lose your leg."
And then I turned around.

37:38.124 --> 37:40.050
Well, he was a dick.

37:40.084 --> 37:41.177
He was.

37:41.211 --> 37:43.512
Was he old? Yes.

37:43.546 --> 37:45.430
Was he disabled? Severely.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.224
[laughter]

37:47.258 --> 37:52.521
Disabled people have to earn their
cool points just like the rest of us.

37:52.555 --> 37:57.318
I'm so exhausted of the idea
that everybody with a disability

37:57.352 --> 38:00.029
is automatically an angel on earth.

38:00.063 --> 38:01.322
They're not.

38:01.356 --> 38:03.907
They're people, and you should
treat them like people.

38:03.941 --> 38:07.494
But you don't. You patronize
the shit out of them. Yeah.

38:07.528 --> 38:10.747
- I know you do.
- [applause]

38:10.781 --> 38:15.544
Of course. There's so many uncomfortably
silent guilty faces in here right now.

38:15.578 --> 38:17.129
[laughter]

38:17.163 --> 38:21.633
Yeah. You know when you're at work
and fucking Sam rolls up?

38:21.667 --> 38:24.053
[laughter]

38:24.087 --> 38:26.430
It's always Sam.

38:26.464 --> 38:28.515
You don't go, "Hey, Sam."

38:28.549 --> 38:30.017
You go, "Hai, Sahm."

38:30.051 --> 38:31.643
[laughter]

38:31.677 --> 38:32.853
And he's like, "Hi."

38:32.887 --> 38:35.064
And you go, "How was your weekend?"

38:35.098 --> 38:37.107
[laughter]

38:37.141 --> 38:39.193
He's like, "It was good."

38:39.227 --> 38:41.737
"Well, that's <i>good</i>!"

38:41.771 --> 38:45.574
And he's like, "You know I'm not
retarded right? I just can't stand up.

38:45.608 --> 38:47.451
You're a fucking asshole."

38:47.485 --> 38:50.646
[crowd laughs, cheers]

38:53.450 --> 38:56.668
Some of them are cool.
Some of them are dicks.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.088
I was walking into a building
not two weeks ago.

38:59.122 --> 39:03.717
I open the door. Ten steps back,
I notice a guy's coming up with no arms.

39:03.751 --> 39:05.552
You know what I do? I hold the door.

39:05.586 --> 39:08.680
And when he gets up, he goes,
"I don't need you to do that shit."

39:08.714 --> 39:09.890
And I go...

39:09.924 --> 39:12.935
[laughter]

39:12.969 --> 39:15.854
- "All right."
- [cheering]

39:15.888 --> 39:18.399
"Okay, Stumpy. Um...

39:18.433 --> 39:20.443
let's watch you bite
that handle for an hour.

39:20.477 --> 39:23.179
- That'll be a fun fucking show."
- [laughter]

39:24.230 --> 39:26.282
Fuck that guy.

39:26.316 --> 39:28.992
Absolutely fuck him. So...

39:29.026 --> 39:31.495
Midnight on this flight,
the lights come on,

39:31.529 --> 39:33.163
and that's too early, right?

39:33.197 --> 39:36.959
That's too early for the red-eye.
I panic. I think we're dying. So...

39:36.993 --> 39:39.586
I see the attendant, I go,
"Hey, what the fuck's happening?"

39:39.620 --> 39:42.005
She goes, "There's a medical
emergency in the back.

39:42.039 --> 39:44.800
Are you a doctor?"
And I go, "Look at me."

39:44.834 --> 39:46.427
[laughter]

39:46.461 --> 39:48.429
"You think I'm a doctor?"

39:48.463 --> 39:51.181
And she goes, "Are any of you?"
And we go, "No."

39:51.215 --> 39:54.310
I said, "I think we just established
that none of us are doctors.

39:54.344 --> 39:56.979
How about you kill those lights
so we can go back to sleep?"

39:57.013 --> 39:58.481
[laughter]

39:58.515 --> 40:00.649
And she goes, "Well, he needs help."

40:00.683 --> 40:03.819
And I go, "Well, we're not doctors.

40:03.853 --> 40:07.764
We could stand around him for a while,
If you think that'll help."

40:09.192 --> 40:10.409
"Yeah, he's fucked up."

40:10.443 --> 40:13.245
[laughter]

40:13.279 --> 40:14.997
"Huh?

40:15.031 --> 40:16.290
Comedian."

40:16.324 --> 40:18.417
[laughter]

40:18.451 --> 40:21.128
"Mostly stories.

40:21.162 --> 40:24.006
Hang in there."
I don't fucking know. So...

40:24.040 --> 40:27.343
half an hour later, lights are still on,
and I go, "What are we doing?"

40:27.377 --> 40:29.636
And she goes,
"I think we're gonna divert."

40:29.670 --> 40:32.306
And I go, "Divert?

40:32.340 --> 40:34.099
Does that mean
we're gonna dump fuel?"

40:34.133 --> 40:39.522
Have you ever asked somebody something
so profoundly stupid to them

40:39.556 --> 40:42.858
that they have to physically regroup
before they answer your question?

40:42.892 --> 40:44.318
[laughter]

40:44.352 --> 40:47.237
Like, she went to answer,
and then she went, "Huh."

40:47.271 --> 40:49.681
[laughter]

40:53.652 --> 40:57.039
Like her brain was like,
control-alt-delete, rebooted...

40:57.073 --> 40:59.041
[laughter]

40:59.075 --> 41:04.129
...and she goes, "Divert doesn't mean
dump fuel, you dumb shit."

41:04.163 --> 41:06.423
And I was like,
"I know, I was just playing. Gah."

41:06.457 --> 41:08.551
[laughter]

41:08.585 --> 41:10.635
She said, "We're gonna land
at the nearest airport.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.722
We'll get him off and we'll get him help.
Then we'll continue."

41:13.756 --> 41:16.266
And I go, "You gotta be shitting me."

41:16.300 --> 41:17.560
And she goes, "No."

41:17.594 --> 41:19.311
And I said, "Well, what if he's dead?"

41:19.345 --> 41:21.355
And she goes, "What?"

41:21.389 --> 41:24.525
- And I go, "If he's dead..."
- [laughter]

41:24.559 --> 41:27.277
"...we're not just gonna land
to drop off some luggage, right?

41:27.311 --> 41:29.112
We're gonna keep going."

41:29.146 --> 41:30.989
And she goes, "I guess so."

41:31.023 --> 41:32.575
[laughter]

41:32.609 --> 41:35.077
And I said, "Well, in that case,
I am a doctor."

41:35.111 --> 41:36.912
[laughter]

41:36.946 --> 41:38.663
"And I'm gonna need a pillow. Stat."

41:38.697 --> 41:40.983
[laughter]

41:42.326 --> 41:44.861
[cheers and applause]

41:48.040 --> 41:51.176
And then, I fucking killed a guy.
On a plane.

41:51.210 --> 41:52.469
[laughter]

41:52.503 --> 41:55.680
It was the most fun
I've ever had in my life.

41:55.714 --> 41:56.848
Um...

41:56.882 --> 42:00.018
Bikes! I get, like...

42:00.052 --> 42:02.605
verbal tics, you know?
I don't have Tourette's.

42:02.639 --> 42:05.732
I wish I did. It looks fun. But...

42:05.766 --> 42:08.735
I'll just yell shit.
It's like a hook on a catchy song,

42:08.769 --> 42:11.238
except it's just stuff that I watch,
and then...

42:11.272 --> 42:13.365
"Bikes!" I just yell it, you know.

42:13.399 --> 42:16.910
Over and over. Only like
two or three million times. But...

42:16.944 --> 42:21.498
I'm obsessed with the show
<i>Scared Straight. </i> Um...

42:21.532 --> 42:25.043
If you've never seen it,
it's tremendous.

42:25.077 --> 42:26.044
Here's what they do.

42:26.078 --> 42:30.132
In the show, they take kids,
middle school and high school kids

42:30.166 --> 42:34.261
that are getting in trouble a lot,
and they send them to jail for a day.

42:34.295 --> 42:37.306
And the idea is that jail
will scare the fuck out of the kid,

42:37.340 --> 42:39.182
and then he'll get his life together.

42:39.216 --> 42:42.811
Hence, <i>Scared Straight.</i>
It's tremendous.

42:42.845 --> 42:45.314
I'm obsessed with one episode.

42:45.348 --> 42:48.150
- It aired once.
- [crowd chuckles]

42:48.184 --> 42:51.111
In 1999.

42:51.145 --> 42:52.404
Here's what's great.

42:52.438 --> 42:57.951
It aired uncensored, which is bananas.

42:57.985 --> 43:02.914
And... in this episode
they did not send the kids to jail,

43:02.948 --> 43:04.040
like they normally do.

43:04.074 --> 43:08.420
Instead, they sent them
to a maximum security penitentiary.

43:08.454 --> 43:10.506
[crowd chuckles]

43:10.540 --> 43:12.174
Prison.

43:12.208 --> 43:16.428
And those prisoners
verbally assaulted these kids

43:16.462 --> 43:18.805
into crying a <i>lot.</i>

43:18.839 --> 43:20.849
[laughter]

43:20.883 --> 43:25.921
And it's the funniest shit
I have ever seen in my life.

43:27.682 --> 43:30.317
First of all,
don't feel, like, too bad for...

43:30.351 --> 43:32.068
these kids are super badass.

43:32.102 --> 43:34.946
They're not like,
spitting spitballs in class and...

43:34.980 --> 43:37.407
They're fucking stabbing other kids.

43:37.441 --> 43:39.034
They're badass kids. Okay?

43:39.068 --> 43:41.495
And they show up
to this thing with attitude.

43:41.529 --> 43:44.373
They walk in, they're like,
"What's up? I run sixth grade.

43:44.407 --> 43:46.667
- I ain't scared of you, man. Like..."
- [laughter]

43:46.701 --> 43:48.918
"You can't scare me."

43:48.952 --> 43:52.255
And they're greeted
by a guy named Crazy Chris.

43:52.289 --> 43:54.341
Chris has scars on his face,

43:54.375 --> 43:56.719
and the screen freezes.

43:56.753 --> 44:00.805
And it says, "Chris killed six people,
and he's doing a double life sentence."

44:00.839 --> 44:02.766
Like, this dude is so bad

44:02.800 --> 44:05.602
that when he dies and he's reincarnated,

44:05.636 --> 44:07.854
that guy is doing life in prison also.

44:07.888 --> 44:09.732
[laughter]

44:09.766 --> 44:13.569
So this is a bad motherfucker right here.

44:13.603 --> 44:15.278
The kids are like squatting around,

44:15.312 --> 44:18.948
and Chris is like,
"Hey. My name's Crazy Chris.

44:18.982 --> 44:22.536
And from now on,
you will see me in your nightmares."

44:22.570 --> 44:25.539
And the kids are like,
"What the fuck?" Like...

44:25.573 --> 44:28.041
"I'm 12. Don't talk to me like that.
Man, that's crazy."

44:28.075 --> 44:31.712
And he goes, "If I ever see you again,
I'll take a bite out of each of you."

44:31.746 --> 44:35.716
And they're like, "All right.
We're reformed now. Thank you very much."

44:35.750 --> 44:37.634
Jesus. But they can't leave.

44:37.668 --> 44:42.431
The next guy comes up to them
and he goes, "Hold mah pocket!

44:42.465 --> 44:46.101
- Hold mah pocket!"
- [crowd chuckles]

44:46.135 --> 44:49.938
And he makes kids walk around
holding the inside of his pocket.

44:49.972 --> 44:52.399
You understand?
So he walks, and then they're like...

44:52.433 --> 44:55.527
[nervous chuckle]

44:55.561 --> 44:57.487
I don't know what you know about prison,

44:57.521 --> 44:59.782
but if you're holding
onto another dude's pocket,

44:59.816 --> 45:03.910
- it's gonna be a rough day. All right?
- [laughter]

45:03.944 --> 45:06.955
Not only is this guy
making kids hold his...

45:06.989 --> 45:09.916
he's talking ridiculous shit

45:09.950 --> 45:11.794
to middle schoolers.

45:11.828 --> 45:14.379
He's like, "I'mma make you
suck my dick for breakfast!"

45:14.413 --> 45:16.089
[laughter]

45:16.123 --> 45:19.050
"Every mornin'."
And the kids are like... [groaning]

45:19.084 --> 45:21.094
[laughter]

45:21.128 --> 45:23.179
"I hate breakfast! Ugh!"

45:23.213 --> 45:26.516
[laughter]

45:26.550 --> 45:28.668
Funny shit like that.

45:30.137 --> 45:31.605
So...

45:31.639 --> 45:33.857
[chortles]

45:33.891 --> 45:36.276
He's like,
"I'mma mush your motherfucking face!"

45:36.310 --> 45:38.069
And the kid's like... [whimpering]

45:38.103 --> 45:40.322
It's so fucking funny. Ah...

45:40.356 --> 45:42.574
[crowd chuckling]

45:42.608 --> 45:46.411
There's one exchange where this dude,
he pulls a kid out of line.

45:46.445 --> 45:49.873
The kid's, like, 13. He weighs,
I don't know, a hundred pounds?

45:49.907 --> 45:51.625
And he has a bowl cut.

45:51.659 --> 45:53.918
Okay? He has a bowl cut.

45:53.952 --> 45:55.211
[laughter]

45:55.245 --> 45:57.547
In prison.

45:57.581 --> 46:00.175
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

46:00.209 --> 46:02.969
It's parted in the middle.

46:03.003 --> 46:04.971
The prisoner goes, "Why you here?"

46:05.005 --> 46:07.932
And the kid's like...
"Ugh. Stealing."

46:07.966 --> 46:10.502
And he goes, "The fuck you took?"

46:12.179 --> 46:14.857
[laughter]

46:14.891 --> 46:17.108
And the kids goes, "B... Bikes."

46:17.142 --> 46:19.569
And he goes, "Bikes!"

46:19.603 --> 46:21.655
And that's why I yell "bikes"
all the time.

46:21.689 --> 46:22.823
[laughter]

46:22.857 --> 46:25.475
[cheers and applause]

46:31.323 --> 46:34.125
You should see me
when we drive by a bike store.

46:34.159 --> 46:36.628
- Holy shit.
- [laughter]

46:36.662 --> 46:39.715
I'll be driving. I'll be like, "Ahh..."

46:39.749 --> 46:44.427
- And my wife, she's pretty over it. Um...
- [laughter]

46:44.461 --> 46:46.095
She'll go, like, "You get one." I'm like,

46:46.129 --> 46:48.807
"All right, I'm gonna
make this shit count."

46:48.841 --> 46:51.393
So, I'll pull over,
roll down the window,

46:51.427 --> 46:54.979
and I wait till I see somebody
checking out one of the sidewalk displays,

46:55.013 --> 46:56.606
like with all the bikes out there,

46:56.640 --> 47:00.068
and when they find one they like
and they're like, "I like this one,"

47:00.102 --> 47:03.822
I'll go, "Bikes!"
And they're like, "What the fuck?!"

47:03.856 --> 47:06.324
And I go, "Stop selling drugs!"
And I drive off.

47:06.358 --> 47:08.702
[laughter]

47:08.736 --> 47:09.828
That's right.

47:09.862 --> 47:13.022
[cheers and applause]

47:15.367 --> 47:17.794
Super fun. You should do it.

47:17.828 --> 47:19.588
Ah, man.

47:19.622 --> 47:22.257
So, my wife is the coolest, actually.
She's the best.

47:22.291 --> 47:26.052
And, uh, she...
we've been together ten years.

47:26.086 --> 47:28.137
And women will actually ask me, sometimes,

47:28.171 --> 47:31.182
they'll be like, "Ten years?
That's a pretty good run.

47:31.216 --> 47:33.727
What's the secret?
<i>Is </i> there a secret?"

47:33.761 --> 47:36.271
And I want to tell you that there is.

47:36.305 --> 47:39.983
And ladies,
the key to your man's heart

47:40.017 --> 47:43.027
is through his... taint.

47:43.061 --> 47:45.029
Now, if you don't know,

47:45.063 --> 47:47.532
the taint is that little strip of land

47:47.566 --> 47:50.243
between a man's balls and his butthole.

47:50.277 --> 47:52.479
[cheers and applause]

47:55.574 --> 47:58.501
Also known as the Devil's Driveway.

47:58.535 --> 48:01.922
- Now...
- [laughter]

48:01.956 --> 48:05.842
...some of you are like,
"I don't want to go there.

48:05.876 --> 48:08.303
That sounds scary."

48:08.337 --> 48:09.930
Well, yeah.

48:09.964 --> 48:11.306
[laughter]

48:11.340 --> 48:13.308
Your man's perineum,

48:13.342 --> 48:17.353
that's like the Incan ruins of his body.

48:17.387 --> 48:20.774
And just like Machu Picchu,
its a little out of the way.

48:20.808 --> 48:22.108
[laughter]

48:22.142 --> 48:26.822
But once you get there,
the rewards are oh, so glorious.

48:26.856 --> 48:29.866
Ladies, I just gave you
top secret clearance. Okay?

48:29.900 --> 48:33.829
Um, welcome to Area 51.

48:33.863 --> 48:36.915
Yeah. I never want to hear
another woman complain,

48:36.949 --> 48:39.292
"I can't get a guy to call me back."

48:39.326 --> 48:43.588
Well, take a vibrator,
press it against his chode,

48:43.622 --> 48:46.508
and you will have
to shut down a cell tower

48:46.542 --> 48:49.469
because that man
is gonna harass you. All right?

48:49.503 --> 48:52.388
[laughter, applause]

48:52.422 --> 48:54.557
[cheering]

48:54.591 --> 48:56.059
Yeah.

48:56.093 --> 48:58.687
After you make him shiver.

48:58.721 --> 49:01.731
[laughter]

49:01.765 --> 49:04.317
Don't be an asshole
and put it on high speed the first time.

49:04.351 --> 49:07.278
You'll send him to the emergency room.
But... Ease into it.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.447
One, two, three. He'll be like, all right!

49:09.481 --> 49:11.767
[laughter]

49:15.946 --> 49:20.291
[sighs] I'm not piling on you for
not doing enough, if you're a woman.

49:20.325 --> 49:22.585
Guys are the worst.
Absolutely.

49:22.619 --> 49:25.588
Every guy friend of mine
that complains about a sex thing,

49:25.622 --> 49:26.840
it's always the same stupid shit.

49:26.874 --> 49:31.453
They'll be like, "You know,
like, I liked her, but she's not slutty.

49:33.047 --> 49:34.305
She didn't do anything slutty."

49:34.339 --> 49:37.433
I'm like, "Huh. You tell her
what you like?" "Unh-unh."

49:37.467 --> 49:40.103
I'm like, "Oh.
Well, you weird silent fuck."

49:40.137 --> 49:42.397
[laughter]

49:42.431 --> 49:44.273
"You gotta tell her.
If she likes you, she'll do it.

49:44.307 --> 49:47.276
Gotta tell her, 'Put on a clown suit
and peg me.' Or whatever you like."

49:47.310 --> 49:50.363
[laughter]

49:50.397 --> 49:52.198
I'll tell you my favorite.
I don't give a shit.

49:52.232 --> 49:54.701
I love the medical genre.

49:54.735 --> 49:56.078
That is my favorite.

49:56.112 --> 49:59.539
I love those pornos
where the guy goes in the doctor's office.

49:59.573 --> 50:01.624
He's like, "Oh, my back hurts."

50:01.658 --> 50:05.879
The nurse is like, "That's 'cause your
big stupid balls are full. Get over here."

50:05.913 --> 50:07.422
[laughter]

50:07.456 --> 50:09.365
I love that.

50:11.168 --> 50:15.471
I love it, I told my wife,
and now we have scrubs.

50:15.505 --> 50:18.182
[laughter, cheers]

50:18.216 --> 50:20.685
Everybody likes it. Don't act like...
whenever you...

50:20.719 --> 50:24.022
If you're a guy and you see a nurse,
you always are like...

50:24.056 --> 50:27.191
"Maybe she'll suck it."
Like that. Like, you always...

50:27.225 --> 50:29.986
Even if you see a nurse walking around,
you're like, "Hey.

50:30.020 --> 50:31.821
What? No,
I didn't say anything. I was just..."

50:31.855 --> 50:33.281
[laughter]

50:33.315 --> 50:36.076
"Do you? Okay, no, you don't? Okay.

50:36.110 --> 50:38.536
No, I feel fine. Thank you."

50:38.570 --> 50:40.371
It's the best. I love...

50:40.405 --> 50:43.291
I love, though, on the medical pornos,
those scenes,

50:43.325 --> 50:47.336
they always end with letting you know
how he's doing medically.

50:47.370 --> 50:49.881
Like the guy goes, "Uhhh.

50:49.915 --> 50:52.383
My back feels better."
You're like, "Oh, wow."

50:52.417 --> 50:53.551
[laughter]

50:53.585 --> 50:57.539
"We were all worried
about your third lumbar. So, that's good."

50:59.008 --> 51:00.767
Crazy, and I swear, this is true,

51:00.801 --> 51:02.477
as much as I love that shit,

51:02.511 --> 51:07.607
I have never in my life
seen a smaller version of my own dick

51:07.641 --> 51:09.109
than when I'm in the doctor's office.

51:09.143 --> 51:11.861
Like, it gets so small,

51:11.895 --> 51:13.571
and it leans to the left.

51:13.605 --> 51:15.698
So my dick is like, "What did you say?"

51:15.732 --> 51:17.617
[laughter]

51:17.651 --> 51:19.327
"Hmm?

51:19.361 --> 51:22.455
Should I be here, Dad?"

51:22.489 --> 51:26.292
You ever yell at it?
You're like, "What the fuck?!

51:26.326 --> 51:28.670
Monday we were hitting thigh,
and today you're like,

51:28.704 --> 51:32.507
- 'I want to stay in bed and read. So...'"
- [laughter]

51:32.541 --> 51:35.510
"'You go out.
I'm gonna draw a bath. Bye.'"

51:35.544 --> 51:38.162
And you'll be like,
"You stupid little dick!"

51:39.589 --> 51:42.058
They have porno suggestions.
Isn't that weird too?

51:42.092 --> 51:44.519
Like you watch a scene,
It's like, "You might also like..."

51:44.553 --> 51:46.938
And you're like, "What?"

51:46.972 --> 51:49.315
And then its like some weird sh...
It's like,

51:49.349 --> 51:52.194
"Sis is mad at her brother
for not leaving,

51:52.228 --> 51:56.698
so she blows him."
And you're like, "Ugh! Gross.

51:56.732 --> 51:59.909
All right, I'm gonna see
what it looks like."

51:59.943 --> 52:02.270
They're not really related.

52:05.615 --> 52:09.169
That scene is so stupid cause they always
call each other Bro and Sis,

52:09.203 --> 52:12.338
like any fucking people
on the planet do that.

52:12.372 --> 52:15.675
The girl's like, "Bro! My friends
are coming over. Get outta here."

52:15.709 --> 52:18.720
He's like, "No way, Sis. Not leaving."

52:18.754 --> 52:20.847
"Come on! What'll it take?"

52:20.881 --> 52:23.349
"Boop. Right there.
That's what it'll take."

52:23.383 --> 52:25.060
"Okay." And you're like, "All right.

52:25.094 --> 52:27.145
It's not a good premise,
but I'll watch it."

52:27.179 --> 52:29.255
[laughter]

52:33.060 --> 52:36.112
[sighs] Let me ask you this.

52:36.146 --> 52:37.446
If you're white,

52:37.480 --> 52:42.410
aren't you a little tired of being
blamed for every racial injustice?

52:42.444 --> 52:45.163
- Like, doesn't part of you...
- [man] Yeah!

52:45.197 --> 52:46.248
[blows raspberry]

52:46.282 --> 52:49.458
[laughter]

52:49.492 --> 52:51.253
Yeah, yeah. No, that's good. So...

52:51.287 --> 52:53.088
[laughter]

52:53.122 --> 52:56.091
People are like, "What the fuck?"

52:56.125 --> 52:59.052
No! That's what I'm saying! Like...

52:59.086 --> 53:01.304
Don't you kinda want to tell, like,
the other people,

53:01.338 --> 53:04.307
"Why doesn't your group
get their shit together, and then

53:04.341 --> 53:08.352
you can ascend to the top and then
<i>you </i> can oppress other people."

53:08.386 --> 53:11.273
[mixed laughter]

53:11.307 --> 53:13.482
Not as many claps on that one.
Well, uh...

53:13.516 --> 53:16.511
[laughter, applause]

53:18.105 --> 53:19.114
Oops.

53:19.148 --> 53:20.990
[crowd chuckles]

53:21.024 --> 53:22.742
Here's all I'm saying. Okay?

53:22.776 --> 53:25.954
Every race is racist. Okay?

53:25.988 --> 53:29.791
We're the best at it,
but every race is racist.

53:29.825 --> 53:31.084
Who's super racist?

53:31.118 --> 53:33.544
Asians. Right? Yeah, you guys are...

53:33.578 --> 53:36.906
You're nodding. Like, "You know
goddamn right I am. Of course."

53:38.416 --> 53:41.177
You don't know about it?
There's a hierarchy to the whole thing.

53:41.211 --> 53:43.972
Here's how it works.
Japanese, they're number one,

53:44.006 --> 53:46.599
which is weird 'cause
their genitals are blurry.

53:46.633 --> 53:49.727
- But they're number one. Right?
- [laughter]

53:49.761 --> 53:51.980
Then...

53:52.014 --> 53:54.632
[crowd cheering]

53:56.226 --> 53:59.112
Chinese and Koreans are right there.

53:59.146 --> 54:02.907
And everybody else
who's, like, tan, like...

54:02.941 --> 54:04.659
[laughter]

54:04.693 --> 54:07.036
Vietnamese and Filipino, they're like...

54:07.070 --> 54:08.746
[spits] "Fuck you!"

54:08.780 --> 54:10.248
[laughter]

54:10.282 --> 54:12.083
True or not?

54:12.117 --> 54:13.793
Yeah.

54:13.827 --> 54:16.879
Don't you feel better about everything
right now? Like...

54:16.913 --> 54:18.714
What's your ethnic background?

54:18.748 --> 54:23.219
You're Chinese? That's number two.
That's almost at the top.

54:23.253 --> 54:25.513
That's great.

54:25.547 --> 54:28.308
That's gotta feel good, right?

54:28.342 --> 54:30.226
Who did you, like...

54:30.260 --> 54:33.021
Who did your parents talk
the most shit about, growing up?

54:33.055 --> 54:36.107
Wait. Were you raised
in an Asian household,

54:36.141 --> 54:39.027
or are you one of those,
"That's cute, lets get one of those"?

54:39.061 --> 54:41.429
[laughter]

54:42.439 --> 54:44.766
'Cause that's a legit question.

54:47.944 --> 54:51.455
Asian? So who'd your parents talk the most
shit about growing up, racially?

54:51.489 --> 54:53.249
- Be honest. Huh?
- [man] Japanese.

54:53.283 --> 54:57.420
- Japanese! Fuckin'... All right, so...
- [laughter]

54:57.454 --> 54:59.214
Do you hate Japanese people?

54:59.248 --> 55:01.799
No? They fucking hate you.
A lot.

55:01.833 --> 55:04.160
[laughter]

55:05.628 --> 55:07.389
You know they do. Uh...

55:07.423 --> 55:11.142
What do your parents say about them?
What's the shit that they talk?

55:11.176 --> 55:13.186
[man] They wanted me to marry one.

55:13.220 --> 55:14.687
They wanted you to marry one?

55:14.721 --> 55:17.190
[man continues indistinctly]

55:17.224 --> 55:20.151
They wanted her to do whatever you want.

55:20.185 --> 55:23.888
- Are your parents Saudi or...?
- [laughter]

55:26.275 --> 55:29.785
Can I get this fucking straight
for a second?

55:29.819 --> 55:33.206
Your parents were like,
"We want our beautiful Chinese boy

55:33.240 --> 55:36.000
to marry a Japanese girl

55:36.034 --> 55:39.170
so that 'she'll do whatever you want'"?

55:39.204 --> 55:41.130
- Meaning they're submissive?
- [man] Yes.

55:41.164 --> 55:44.867
Yeah. All right. So who's this fucking
lady sitting next to you?

55:49.798 --> 55:51.766
What's she all about?

55:51.800 --> 55:53.893
Hey! Don't fucking answer. It's his world.

55:53.927 --> 55:57.730
- What is... What is, uh...
- [roaring laughter]

55:57.764 --> 55:59.399
Ask him if you can answer.

55:59.433 --> 56:01.843
[laughter]

56:04.480 --> 56:06.489
She's Chinese? Damn!

56:06.523 --> 56:09.242
[laughter]

56:09.276 --> 56:11.453
Do you know... [laughs]

56:11.487 --> 56:13.788
Do you know how I found out
about Asian racism?

56:13.822 --> 56:16.332
This is how I found out about it.
I had no idea.

56:16.366 --> 56:18.667
I'm shooting a commercial in L.A.,

56:18.701 --> 56:21.337
and they fly in a Japanese director, okay?

56:21.371 --> 56:23.881
- Uhhh. Grunts, everything. So...
- [laughter]

56:23.915 --> 56:26.884
Yeah. So I was like,
"Do you have indigestion?"

56:26.918 --> 56:28.594
He was, "Uhh. No."

56:28.628 --> 56:31.306
We're shooting the commercial,
and between takes,

56:31.340 --> 56:33.599
there's a Filipino production assistant.

56:33.633 --> 56:36.269
So, he come up and talks to us
and he walks away.

56:36.303 --> 56:39.188
And when he walks away,
I see the Japanese director

56:39.222 --> 56:42.591
give him a very dismissive look, like...

56:44.060 --> 56:48.323
And I go, "Hey! I saw that, with my eyes.
What was that all about?"

56:48.357 --> 56:51.575
I go, "You don't like him?"
And he goes...

56:51.609 --> 56:55.204
And I go, "Why not?"
And he goes...

56:55.238 --> 56:56.539
[laughter]

56:56.573 --> 56:58.166
Did you catch it? It was really fast.

56:58.200 --> 56:59.792
[laughter]

56:59.826 --> 57:03.921
He basically said, "I don't like him
'cause I don't like his skin color."

57:03.955 --> 57:06.632
And he did it with this little gesture.

57:06.666 --> 57:10.094
And I was like, "Holy shit!

57:10.128 --> 57:13.431
That's fucking brilliant.
How did I not think of that?"

57:13.465 --> 57:16.267
You don't have to worry about people
hearing you and getting hit.

57:16.301 --> 57:18.186
Just make a little thing
and move it along. Like...

57:18.220 --> 57:20.104
[laughter]

57:20.138 --> 57:24.108
Don't act like you're not gonna use that
five fucking times this week.

57:24.142 --> 57:26.510
[applause]

57:28.938 --> 57:32.741
When you're in your favorite restaurant
and "they" come in, you're like...

57:32.775 --> 57:34.202
[laughter]

57:34.236 --> 57:36.037
"Let's take it to go. Thanks a lot."

57:36.071 --> 57:38.314
[laughter]

57:40.992 --> 57:44.086
Oh, guys. Thank you for having jobs.

57:44.120 --> 57:46.548
Um... I'm assuming you do.

57:46.582 --> 57:50.759
I don't fucking know. You're here.
Maybe you robbed somebody. But...

57:50.793 --> 57:54.722
I was just thinking about how long
it's been since I've had a job,

57:54.756 --> 57:58.684
and how I absolutely could not
get one right now.

57:58.718 --> 58:01.729
If I went into a place and gave them
my résumé, they'd be like,

58:01.763 --> 58:05.941
"What's with this 13-year gap
on here, man?"

58:05.975 --> 58:10.238
And I'd be like, "What's with all
the questions, dude? Chill out."

58:10.272 --> 58:14.158
I mean, if I had to get a job,
I think I would just go for a job

58:14.192 --> 58:16.744
where no one knows
what the fuck I'm talking about,

58:16.778 --> 58:19.497
so I could just make shit up. Because...

58:19.531 --> 58:20.915
There's a few of those.

58:20.949 --> 58:24.919
Like, the spokesman
for an arson investigation. Um...

58:24.953 --> 58:28.423
Arson means fire, by the way.
I'm seeing a lot of blank faces. And...

58:28.457 --> 58:30.132
[laughter]

58:30.166 --> 58:31.842
You can see them online.

58:31.876 --> 58:34.637
Like, a guy comes out to a podium,

58:34.671 --> 58:36.722
and there's a mic
and there's news people around.

58:36.756 --> 58:39.475
There's a burned down building
behind, and he's just like...

58:39.509 --> 58:42.395
"Hey. That shit burned down."

58:42.429 --> 58:44.522
[laughter]

58:44.556 --> 58:46.566
"Could you tell us a little more?"

58:46.600 --> 58:49.735
He's like, "What?" Totally aggravated.
"What do you wanna know?"

58:49.769 --> 58:52.888
"How did it start?"
"It was a match."

58:54.441 --> 58:57.743
And they go, "How do you know?"
"We found it."

58:57.777 --> 59:01.914
"It." Like it's one. There's other
matches and he's like, "Mm-mmm."

59:01.948 --> 59:03.607
"This one."

59:04.993 --> 59:06.669
They go,
"How do you know that's the match?"

59:06.703 --> 59:09.947
"Just complicated fire shit.
You wouldn't understand."

59:11.958 --> 59:13.092
Thing is, man,

59:13.126 --> 59:17.221
I miss zero part of having a day job.

59:17.255 --> 59:19.140
That's the truth. I miss zero part.

59:19.174 --> 59:21.517
The only part I still miss

59:21.551 --> 59:26.439
is spreading rumors and gossip
about people that work there.

59:26.473 --> 59:28.441
That's the fucking best.

59:28.475 --> 59:30.818
It is! I remember.

59:30.852 --> 59:32.570
Going to work sucks.

59:32.604 --> 59:34.697
That's universal. I mean, shit!

59:34.731 --> 59:36.574
Most of you will have it on Monday.

59:36.608 --> 59:39.535
Fuckin'... the alarm goes off,
and you go, "Motherfucker!"

59:39.569 --> 59:42.146
[laughter]

59:45.867 --> 59:47.876
"Today's gonna <i>suck</i>!"

59:47.910 --> 59:49.904
[laughter]

59:51.080 --> 59:56.051
"But I'm gonna talk shit about Amanda
when I get there." And then that...

59:56.085 --> 59:57.886
raises your spirit right?

59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.349
You think about that in the shower.
"I'm gonna ruin Amanda's day today."

01:00:01.383 --> 01:00:02.933
[laughter]

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:05.669
"This is for you, Amanda. Aahh."

01:00:07.305 --> 01:00:12.109
The fucked-up thing is people
making you feel badly for enjoying that.

01:00:12.143 --> 01:00:14.696
You shouldn't feel badly
for enjoying gossip.

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:17.573
It's 100 percent normal
and natural to

01:00:17.607 --> 01:00:21.536
because it's definitely
an extension of childhood.

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:25.623
Because all of us, when we were kids,
and all kids now,

01:00:25.657 --> 01:00:30.127
for a certain period of time,
the worst storytellers ever, okay?

01:00:30.161 --> 01:00:32.963
You don't know shit
about editing information,

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:35.383
enhancing things,
keeping people's interest.

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:37.760
You don't have to have a kid to
know about this.

01:00:37.794 --> 01:00:40.179
Talk to any kid. A friends kid.
A niece, a nephew.

01:00:40.213 --> 01:00:43.307
It's when you go to a kid, you go like,
"Hey, were you outside?"

01:00:43.341 --> 01:00:45.142
And they go, "Yeah!" And you're like,

01:00:45.176 --> 01:00:48.396
"Why don't you dial that back?
That was crazy. Okay?"

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:51.566
And then you ask one question, like,
"How was that?" And they go,

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.194
"I have... When...
When Jeanette came by,

01:00:55.228 --> 01:00:58.197
she... she didn't...
she brought the yellow cup that...

01:00:58.231 --> 01:01:01.409
she didn't want to kick the ball back,
but I said, can...

01:01:01.443 --> 01:01:03.786
'Cause Brian's cup is red,

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:07.582
that if you... if you...
if you don't have it now,

01:01:07.616 --> 01:01:10.084
then you don't have to bring the blue...

01:01:10.118 --> 01:01:13.462
'Cause the blue one
that Jane had was with her.

01:01:13.496 --> 01:01:15.130
I said, 'If you don't have it,

01:01:15.164 --> 01:01:18.342
you can... you can use mine now,
but then...

01:01:18.376 --> 01:01:20.636
then next it's my turn.'"

01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:23.138
You go, "That was a great fucking story.
Thank you."

01:01:23.172 --> 01:01:26.167
[laughter, applause]

01:01:29.846 --> 01:01:31.230
Je-sus!

01:01:31.264 --> 01:01:33.482
[laughter]

01:01:33.516 --> 01:01:38.153
And then kids accidentally tell
their first good story.

01:01:38.187 --> 01:01:40.573
They don't mean to, it's an accident.

01:01:40.607 --> 01:01:42.283
That's why it leaves an impact.

01:01:42.317 --> 01:01:44.285
'Cause you go, "Were you at the park?"

01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:45.828
And they go, "Yeah."

01:01:45.862 --> 01:01:47.371
And you go, "How was that?"

01:01:47.405 --> 01:01:49.290
And they go, "I saw Uncle Jeff,

01:01:49.324 --> 01:01:53.628
and he had a lady sitting on his lap.
But it wasn't Aunt Maria."

01:01:53.662 --> 01:01:55.003
And you're like, "What?"

01:01:55.037 --> 01:01:57.490
[laughter]

01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:04.930
And the kid's like, "Shit, I've never seen
that fucking face before!"

01:02:04.964 --> 01:02:09.518
And you're like, "That's a good story.
Go find more stories like that."

01:02:09.552 --> 01:02:11.312
[laughter]

01:02:11.346 --> 01:02:13.063
That's burned into your psyche.

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:15.775
That's why you go to work,
you see your coworker,

01:02:15.809 --> 01:02:17.485
you're like, "Hey, I got some juice."

01:02:17.519 --> 01:02:20.863
And they're like, "Is it gonna negatively
impact somebody's life?"

01:02:20.897 --> 01:02:22.865
[chortles] "Yeah." And they're like,

01:02:22.899 --> 01:02:24.992
"Fucking hook that shit up!"

01:02:25.026 --> 01:02:27.769
[cheers and applause]

01:02:29.531 --> 01:02:33.292
I've spread so many fucking rumors.

01:02:33.326 --> 01:02:37.588
My favorite part about rumors,
nobody verifies shit.

01:02:37.622 --> 01:02:39.548
Somebody says something once
and you're like,

01:02:39.582 --> 01:02:42.826
"Cool, I'll roll with that forever.
Thanks, man."

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.722
"Are you gonna fact check that?"
"Why? You said it out loud.

01:02:46.756 --> 01:02:51.310
I don't have to check anything out.
It's now a fact. So, whatever."

01:02:51.344 --> 01:02:55.397
It's a seed, right?
You ever a part of one that just grows?

01:02:55.431 --> 01:02:58.317
I remember years ago,
I'm watching a movie with my dad.

01:02:58.351 --> 01:02:59.819
In the middle of the movie,

01:02:59.853 --> 01:03:03.030
the actor, Tommy Lee Jones,
appears onscreen.

01:03:03.064 --> 01:03:04.532
Great actor. Oscar winner.

01:03:04.566 --> 01:03:10.287
Unprompted, my dad turns to me
and he goes, "Did you know he was gay?"

01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:13.040
And I was like, "No."

01:03:13.074 --> 01:03:14.124
"Yeah."

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:16.043
[laughter]

01:03:16.077 --> 01:03:19.046
Now, it doesn't matter, and I don't care.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.507
But I decided I would tell

01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:25.260
everyone I ever met
for the rest of my life

01:03:25.294 --> 01:03:27.971
that Tommy Lee Jones is gay.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:31.016
I told a lot of people.

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.977
Like, from <i>The Fugitive</i>
through <i>No Country for Old Men.</i>

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:37.606
- I told everybody.
- [laughter]

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:42.403
Until one day I told somebody
and he goes, "No, he isn't."

01:03:42.437 --> 01:03:44.446
And I was like, "Yeah, he is."

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.281
And he goes, "How do you know that?"

01:03:46.315 --> 01:03:48.200
And I said, "My dad told me."

01:03:48.234 --> 01:03:50.619
[laughter]

01:03:50.653 --> 01:03:52.496
"What? Your dad fuck him
or something?"

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.081
[laughter]

01:03:54.115 --> 01:03:57.125
I was like, "I don't think so."

01:03:57.159 --> 01:03:59.420
Then he goes, "I've known him 40 years.

01:03:59.454 --> 01:04:03.006
I know his wife and kids. I knew him
when he was single. He is not gay."

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.843
And I go, "What is happening right now?"

01:04:05.877 --> 01:04:07.428
[laughter]

01:04:07.462 --> 01:04:10.097
And I called my dad immediately.

01:04:10.131 --> 01:04:13.308
And I was like, "Dad!

01:04:13.342 --> 01:04:18.981
I just got confirmation
that Tommy Lee Jones isn't gay."

01:04:19.015 --> 01:04:22.192
And my dad goes,
"Oh, I thought he was."

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:24.403
[laughter]

01:04:24.437 --> 01:04:28.574
"Is that the end of your investigation?
Are you fucking serious?

01:04:28.608 --> 01:04:31.953
Why did you tell me that?"
He goes, "I don't know."

01:04:31.987 --> 01:04:36.123
I said, "Did somebody tell you?"
He goes, "I can't remember."

01:04:36.157 --> 01:04:40.502
I said, "Have you been telling everybody
for 15 years that Tommy Lee Jones is gay?"

01:04:40.536 --> 01:04:42.588
And he goes, "Yep."

01:04:42.622 --> 01:04:46.341
I go, "Don't you think we should stop?"
He goes, "Now we should."

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.510
[laughter]

01:04:48.544 --> 01:04:50.663
Just made that shit up.

01:04:51.673 --> 01:04:54.516
This is not made-up.
I'll tell you this, man.

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:56.560
[sighs] Not too long ago,

01:04:56.594 --> 01:05:00.188
I met former heavyweight
champion of the world

01:05:00.222 --> 01:05:02.566
Iron Mike Tyson. And...

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.511
[cheers and applause]

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:12.075
It completely changed my perspective
on a famous person,

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:14.787
'cause I thought I knew famous people.

01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:17.331
Friends of mine on TV and movies,

01:05:17.365 --> 01:05:20.375
they are dog shit next to Mike Tyson.

01:05:20.409 --> 01:05:25.172
Think about how... he is famous
the way an ex-president is famous,

01:05:25.206 --> 01:05:29.092
in that he can't go anywhere in the world
without everyone knowing who he is.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:33.096
You can take him to the Philippines,
you can take him to Siberia,

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.265
you can take him to Namibia
and people would be like,

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:38.811
[smacking] "Mike Tyson."
Everybody knows Mike Tyson.

01:05:38.845 --> 01:05:42.356
That's a perfect impression,
by the way. So...

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:46.944
we're on an afternoon flight
from L.A. to Pittsburgh.

01:05:46.978 --> 01:05:50.155
He is sitting across the aisle
one row back.

01:05:50.189 --> 01:05:51.866
He's right there.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:55.327
It takes an extra hour
to board the flight. Why?

01:05:55.361 --> 01:05:59.707
Because every passenger that boards
sees him, and they're like,

01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:02.584
"Get the fuck out of here."

01:06:02.618 --> 01:06:05.046
And they shit their pants.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.756
And he's super nice.
He shakes everyone's hand.

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:10.509
Flight attendants are telling people,
"Go to your seat."

01:06:10.543 --> 01:06:13.136
- And they're like, "Nope."
- [laughter]

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:15.430
"Talking to him."

01:06:15.464 --> 01:06:17.307
"We're not asking you,
we're telling you."

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:19.935
"I don't give a shit.
I'm not going anywhere."

01:06:19.969 --> 01:06:23.105
It takes forever. We leave late.
I don't say anything.

01:06:23.139 --> 01:06:25.315
About half an hour's left in the flight,

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:28.527
and then I tell myself,
"You have to say something.

01:06:28.561 --> 01:06:30.320
You're never going to run into him again."

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:34.033
So I get up, walk over to his seat
and I go, "I'm sorry to bother you.

01:06:34.067 --> 01:06:37.078
I grew up watching all of your fights,
and I'm a big fan."

01:06:37.112 --> 01:06:38.913
And he goes, "Thank you."

01:06:38.947 --> 01:06:40.081
[laughter]

01:06:40.115 --> 01:06:43.042
I said, "I'm just curious,
why are you going to Pittsburgh?"

01:06:43.076 --> 01:06:46.128
He goes, "I'm promoting a fight.
What about you?"

01:06:46.162 --> 01:06:49.048
I said, "I'm a comedian.
I'm going to do shows."

01:06:49.082 --> 01:06:51.158
And he goes... [giggles]

01:06:52.543 --> 01:06:54.177
"You're a comedian?"

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.303
I go, "Yeah."

01:06:55.337 --> 01:06:56.972
He said, "Where's your show?"

01:06:57.006 --> 01:07:00.183
I said "It's a comedy club
called the Pittsburgh Improv."

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:01.727
And he goes, "Where's that?"

01:07:01.761 --> 01:07:05.188
- And I go, "I have no fucking idea."
- [laughter]

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:07.733
And he goes, "Is your show tonight?"
And I go, "No.

01:07:07.767 --> 01:07:10.527
It's eleven o'clock at night
and we're on a plane."

01:07:10.561 --> 01:07:13.054
[laughter]

01:07:17.193 --> 01:07:19.520
"We're in the sky right now, Mike."

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:22.998
He goes, "Well, when's your show?"

01:07:23.032 --> 01:07:24.959
And I go, "Tomorrow."

01:07:24.993 --> 01:07:26.334
And he goes, "Where?"

01:07:26.368 --> 01:07:29.738
And I go,
"Still at the Pittsburgh Improv."

01:07:30.748 --> 01:07:32.466
He goes, "How do I find it?"

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:36.637
I go, "I don't fucking know.
Google it."

01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:39.598
Then it hits me, like, two seconds later

01:07:39.632 --> 01:07:42.977
how batshit crazy it is of me

01:07:43.011 --> 01:07:45.353
to tell him to like, Google it.

01:07:45.387 --> 01:07:48.273
- You know? Like...
- [laughter]

01:07:48.307 --> 01:07:50.192
"You figure it out, fuckface!"

01:07:50.226 --> 01:07:51.485
[laughter]

01:07:51.519 --> 01:07:53.904
Am I out of my mind? So...

01:07:53.938 --> 01:07:56.281
I grab a DVD out of my bag,
I give it to him.

01:07:56.315 --> 01:07:59.785
I go, "It has my name on it, just
type it in. It'll show you where I'm at."

01:07:59.819 --> 01:08:02.955
He goes, "Thank you."
I go, "That's cool. I met Tyson."

01:08:02.989 --> 01:08:06.541
Ten seconds later,
I'm sitting in my seat and I hear,

01:08:06.575 --> 01:08:08.251
"Tom?"

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:10.696
[laughter]

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:16.718
"Yes, Mike Tyson?"

01:08:16.752 --> 01:08:18.970
He goes,
"Were you on television recently?"

01:08:19.005 --> 01:08:21.098
And I go, "Mm-mmm."

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:22.933
He goes, "Are you sure?"

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:24.643
And I go, "Yeah, I think so."

01:08:24.676 --> 01:08:26.353
And he goes, "Nothing?"

01:08:26.386 --> 01:08:28.856
And I go, "I mean, I'm on Netflix."

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:31.233
And he goes, "I fucking love Netflix."

01:08:31.267 --> 01:08:34.069
[laughter]

01:08:34.103 --> 01:08:35.154
"Okay."

01:08:35.188 --> 01:08:37.948
He goes, "What's your favorite show
on Netflix, Tom?"

01:08:37.982 --> 01:08:41.326
I go, "Are we really doing this right now?

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.745
Like, shouting across the aisle?"

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:46.122
"I like <i>House of Cards, </i> man!" Like...

01:08:46.157 --> 01:08:47.957
[laughter]

01:08:47.992 --> 01:08:49.792
It feels crazy, okay?

01:08:49.827 --> 01:08:52.129
So, I'm super nervous.
I don't know what to say...

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:55.006
I'm like, "I don't know.
I watched <i>Breaking Bad </i> on Netflix."

01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:58.093
And he goes,
"My <i>wife</i> likes <i>Breaking Bad."</i>

01:08:58.127 --> 01:09:00.804
But he said it like,
"You like shit my wife likes."

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:03.098
And I was like, "Ugh."

01:09:03.131 --> 01:09:05.934
Then his eyes light up like saucers,
and he's like,

01:09:05.968 --> 01:09:08.310
"Oh! You like <i>Sons of Anarchy?"</i>

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:11.064
And I know it's a great show.
There's a lot of great shows.

01:09:11.099 --> 01:09:13.274
I can't see every show.
I've never seen it.

01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:16.862
Do you ever lie?
Like a child to an adult?

01:09:16.895 --> 01:09:19.740
'Cause you think they'll like you more
if you like the same thing?

01:09:19.774 --> 01:09:23.243
Well, I saw that face and I go,
"It's my favorite show of all time."

01:09:23.278 --> 01:09:25.520
[laughter]

01:09:27.865 --> 01:09:30.042
And he's like, "It's the shit!"

01:09:30.076 --> 01:09:33.212
And I was like, "Oh, I know.
That one episode? That's my favorite."

01:09:33.246 --> 01:09:37.381
And then he gives me
a fist bump across the aisle, right?

01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:39.093
Is this not registering to you?

01:09:39.127 --> 01:09:42.054
I get a Mike Tyson fist bump.

01:09:42.087 --> 01:09:44.805
[crowd cheers]

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.268
Yeah.

01:09:47.301 --> 01:09:52.522
I can feel his powers
transferring from his hand into mine.

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:56.026
I'm like, "Oh, shit." That's crazy, right?

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.736
I'm so happy.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.529
And then a few seconds later,

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:01.949
I feel a bear paw on my shoulder.

01:10:01.983 --> 01:10:05.535
And I turn,
and Tyson is standing above me.

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:08.580
- I'm like, "Jesus Christ!"
- [laughter]

01:10:08.614 --> 01:10:14.336
Immediately he leans down and he whispers
in my ear so nobody else can hear,

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:19.133
and he goes,
"I've been watching a lot of Netflix."

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:22.327
- That's it. That's all he said.
- [laughter]

01:10:25.547 --> 01:10:28.767
Dude, I never thought
that sentence could be terrifying.

01:10:28.801 --> 01:10:30.919
[laughter]

01:10:33.222 --> 01:10:36.358
And now he's just looking at me like,
"Now <i>you </i> say something, bitch."

01:10:36.392 --> 01:10:38.152
Ya know?

01:10:38.186 --> 01:10:42.072
I was like, "I never turn it off.
It's the best." I don't know what to say.

01:10:42.106 --> 01:10:44.116
He goes, "Now I recognize you."

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:45.492
And I go, "What?"

01:10:45.526 --> 01:10:47.328
And he holds up the DVD.

01:10:47.362 --> 01:10:51.039
And I go, "I just gave that to you."

01:10:51.073 --> 01:10:53.792
And he goes,
"It's the same picture that's on Netflix."

01:10:53.826 --> 01:10:56.128
And I go, "Oh, yeah.
That's the same picture."

01:10:56.162 --> 01:10:57.671
He goes, "I know who you are."

01:10:57.705 --> 01:10:59.381
I go, "That's crazy."

01:10:59.415 --> 01:11:01.049
And he goes,
"Give me your phone number."

01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.410
And I go, "What?!"

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.055
I give him my number, we land.

01:11:07.089 --> 01:11:09.599
I fucking run off the plane. Okay?

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:14.104
It's like...
too much weird shit for one day.

01:11:14.138 --> 01:11:15.563
The next day,

01:11:15.597 --> 01:11:21.553
I'm sitting in my hotel room,
and I get a text message from Mike Tyson.

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:26.516
[cheers and applause]

01:11:28.986 --> 01:11:30.745
You know what it says?

01:11:30.779 --> 01:11:33.899
- "Where's your show?"
- [laughter]

01:11:35.826 --> 01:11:38.086
And I go, "The Pittsburgh Improv."

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.505
"Where's that?"

01:11:40.539 --> 01:11:42.049
<i>I </i> fucking Google it.

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:44.509
[laughter]

01:11:44.543 --> 01:11:47.221
I send it to him, and the phone rings.

01:11:47.255 --> 01:11:50.807
"Hey, Tom."

01:11:50.841 --> 01:11:53.127
And I go, "'Sup, Champ?"

01:11:56.472 --> 01:11:59.007
[cheers and applause]

01:12:02.395 --> 01:12:05.364
He goes, "We're coming
to your show tonight, brother."

01:12:05.398 --> 01:12:08.200
And I go, "That's fucking crazy!"

01:12:08.234 --> 01:12:10.493
He goes, "Yeah, we wanna watch you
do your work."

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:12.120
And I go, "Well, I'm honored."

01:12:12.154 --> 01:12:14.664
And he goes, "It's all love."

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:17.192
[laughter]

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:21.504
I know what he's saying.
I know the expression.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:24.966
And I just want to reciprocate,
but I... I don't know what to do.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.136
And I'm super nervous,
and I just go, "I love you."

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:30.789
[laughter]

01:12:33.759 --> 01:12:37.979
And he goes, "Mmm, good luck
at your show." And he hangs up the phone.

01:12:38.013 --> 01:12:40.190
Seattle, you're the best.
Thank you so much.

01:12:40.224 --> 01:12:42.943
- Thank you very much.
- [cheers and applause]

01:12:42.977 --> 01:12:45.053
Appreciate it. Thank you.

01:12:47.022 --> 01:12:49.891
