00:04.338 --> 00:05.547
Who wants to make

00:04.338 --> 00:05.547
five bucks?

00:05.589 --> 00:06.548
How?

00:06.590 --> 00:07.967
I need someone

00:08.008 --> 00:09.134
to take the fall.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.094
LOIS:

00:09.176 --> 00:11.094
Oh, my God!

00:09.176 --> 00:11.094
What did you do?

00:11.136 --> 00:12.220
I can't tell you.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.722
Yes or no, no questions asked.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.098
LOIS:

00:13.764 --> 00:15.098
Oh, my God!

00:15.140 --> 00:16.308
Make it ten.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.059
Done.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.061
LOIS:

00:18.101 --> 00:20.061
Oh, my God!

00:20.103 --> 00:21.689
You're a good son.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.689
I got him, honey!

00:21.730 --> 00:24.149
I got him!

Mmm. Boys?

01:10.362 --> 01:12.531
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.825
Ooh! Feel ten pounds lighter.

01:14.867 --> 01:15.910
You ready?

01:15.951 --> 01:17.077
Oh, yeah. Go.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.123
Uh, aah...

01:19.621 --> 01:22.123
(rapidly breathing)

01:22.165 --> 01:23.333
Dad got us

01:22.165 --> 01:23.333
free tickets

01:23.375 --> 01:25.126
to the water slide

01:23.375 --> 01:25.126
park from work.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.545
It takes two days

01:25.168 --> 01:26.545
to prep him,

01:26.587 --> 01:27.838
but it's worth it.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.924
Ooh, smooth as a seal.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.383
Ready for that water slide.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.969
You know, we haven't been

01:31.425 --> 01:33.969
on an outing in a long time.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.346
It's nice when we can do things

01:34.011 --> 01:36.346
together as a family.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.140
Do what together?

01:39.182 --> 01:41.142
(sobbing):

01:39.182 --> 01:41.142
Why can't I go?

01:41.184 --> 01:42.853
Dewey, we discussed this.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.980
You have to stay home

01:42.895 --> 01:44.980
because of your ear infection.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.190
I never get to go.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.859
Honey, I know it seems

01:47.232 --> 01:48.859
like a pattern,

01:48.901 --> 01:49.860
but it's just this.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.152
And Disneyland.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.947
(whimpering)

01:52.988 --> 01:55.074
Oh, and that

01:52.988 --> 01:55.074
chocolate factory tour.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.241
You know,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.241
maybe it's time you stopped

01:56.283 --> 01:57.367
sticking dirty things

01:56.283 --> 01:57.367
in your ears.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.159
REESE:

01:57.409 --> 01:58.159
Hey, Dewey.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.328
How's the ear?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.456
Stop teasing

02:00.370 --> 02:02.456
him, Reese!

02:02.497 --> 02:04.792
You know, if your father

02:02.497 --> 02:04.792
doesn't find a babysitter,

02:04.833 --> 02:06.167
nobody's going anywhere

02:04.833 --> 02:06.167
and we'll just see

02:04.833 --> 02:06.167
who's crying then!

02:06.209 --> 02:08.378
Oh, no, no, no.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.378
It's just the little one.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.632
Yeah, the other two

02:08.420 --> 02:11.632
aren't going to be

02:08.420 --> 02:11.632
anywhere near you.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.174
Ever since

02:11.673 --> 02:13.174
I can remember,

02:13.216 --> 02:15.803
we've always had trouble

02:13.216 --> 02:15.803
with babysitters.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.178
(cooing):

02:15.844 --> 02:17.178
Hello!

02:17.220 --> 02:18.973
Goochy, goochy,

02:17.220 --> 02:18.973
goochy, goo.

02:19.014 --> 02:19.974
Goochy, goochy...

02:20.015 --> 02:21.391
(screaming)

02:21.433 --> 02:23.268
WOMAN:

02:21.433 --> 02:23.268
I don't know, sweetie.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.562
What  do  you have

02:23.310 --> 02:25.562
behind your back?

02:25.604 --> 02:28.023
(screaming)

02:31.610 --> 02:32.486
MAN:

02:31.610 --> 02:32.486
You little losers!

02:32.527 --> 02:33.862
I've had enough of this.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.572
You open this door

02:33.904 --> 02:35.572
right now.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.699
Okay, look. I'm a little

02:35.614 --> 02:37.699
claustrophobic, okay?

02:37.741 --> 02:39.200
Just open the door!

02:37.741 --> 02:39.200
Just let me out!

02:39.242 --> 02:41.202
Come on!

02:41.244 --> 02:42.621
I don't know.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.205
I'm starting to think

02:42.663 --> 02:44.205
it might be us.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.627
Well, you'd think I'd get bored

02:48.669 --> 02:50.838
wiping the floor with my cadets.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.714
God knows

02:50.879 --> 02:52.714
we enjoy it, sir.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.676
Do you know what

02:52.756 --> 02:55.676
your problem is, cadet?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.303
Discipline.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.015
Anything worth doing

02:58.345 --> 03:01.015
is worth doing well.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.934
Whatever I do,

03:01.056 --> 03:03.934
whether it's teaching you boys

03:03.976 --> 03:08.647
or mastering tai chi,

03:03.976 --> 03:08.647
or playing pool...

03:10.273 --> 03:11.650
I focus.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.234
I push myself.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.487
But you don't commit

03:13.276 --> 03:15.487
to anything, son.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.447
You're never going

03:15.529 --> 03:17.447
to be a winner

03:17.489 --> 03:21.743
because you do everything

03:17.489 --> 03:21.743
half-assed.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.455
Oh, regrettable.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.249
You may have spoken too soon,

03:25.497 --> 03:28.249
sir.

03:28.291 --> 03:32.253
I think you'll find I play pool

03:28.291 --> 03:32.253
with my whole ass.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.255
Eight ball, corner pocket.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.676
Damn.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.469
Ah, the fatal scratch.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.514
Once again,

03:39.511 --> 03:42.514
I waltz with Lady Victory.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.850
And until you focus,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.850
Francis,

03:44.892 --> 03:49.188
she is never going to be

03:44.892 --> 03:49.188
your dance partner.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.272
LOIS:

03:49.229 --> 03:51.272
Thank you so much for coming

03:49.229 --> 03:51.272
on such short notice.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.774
And it was so nice

03:51.314 --> 03:52.774
of your agency

03:52.816 --> 03:54.568
to give us a second chance.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.320
You two are going to have

03:54.609 --> 03:57.320
so much fun together.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.281
(quietly):

03:57.362 --> 04:00.281
Don't you dare hurt her.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.243
Hurry,

04:00.323 --> 04:03.243
the sun's coming up!

04:08.623 --> 04:11.168
Do you want to play something?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.213
No.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.674
Hey, hey, look, kids.

04:17.716 --> 04:21.302
Only 12 more miles

04:17.716 --> 04:21.302
to Wavetown, USA.

04:17.716 --> 04:21.302
Yay.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.680
So, Malcolm, you

04:21.344 --> 04:23.680
going to go down the

04:21.344 --> 04:23.680
Liquidator this time?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.224
Don't pressure

04:23.722 --> 04:25.224
the boy, Hal.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.184
I'm not pressuring him.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.184
I'm just asking.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.810
He's scared enough

04:27.226 --> 04:28.810
as it is

04:28.852 --> 04:31.605
without you making

04:28.852 --> 04:31.605
a big deal out of it.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.568
Hey, Mom, doesn't

04:34.399 --> 04:36.568
Malcolm have to wear

04:36.610 --> 04:38.779
his nose plug

04:36.610 --> 04:38.779
for his sinuses?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.779
Shut up.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.322
Oh, that's right.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.322
I forgot it.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.491
Listen, honey, you just be

04:41.364 --> 04:43.491
very careful then, okay?

04:43.533 --> 04:45.619
Don't worry,

04:43.533 --> 04:45.619
here it is.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.579
Oh. Thank you,

04:45.660 --> 04:47.579
Reese.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.500
Oh, my gosh,

04:51.374 --> 04:52.500
look at this!

04:52.542 --> 04:53.710
REESE:

04:52.542 --> 04:53.710
This is awesome!

04:53.752 --> 04:55.295
I can't wait

04:53.752 --> 04:55.295
to get on the rides.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.342
Malcolm, don't think

04:59.299 --> 05:01.342
you can take off

05:01.384 --> 05:02.928
that nose plug

05:01.384 --> 05:02.928
just because I'm not looking.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.972
You're going

05:02.970 --> 05:04.972
to wear it all day.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.389
But I'm not even in the water.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.142
Hey. If I catch you,

05:06.431 --> 05:08.142
for even one second,

05:08.183 --> 05:09.268
not wearing that nose plug,

05:09.309 --> 05:10.852
you're going to spend the day

05:10.894 --> 05:12.646
in the kiddie

05:10.894 --> 05:12.646
sprinkler.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.355
So what do you want

05:12.687 --> 05:14.355
to do first?

05:14.397 --> 05:17.025
What makes you think I want

05:14.397 --> 05:17.025
to do anything with you?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.359
What's your problem?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.361
That nose plug thing

05:18.401 --> 05:20.361
was bogus.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.030
You crossed the line, Reese.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.073
What?!

05:23.115 --> 05:24.199
You sold me out to Mom.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.366
It would've been different

05:25.408 --> 05:27.202
if I had done

05:25.408 --> 05:27.202
something to you, but...

05:27.244 --> 05:28.369
that was

05:27.244 --> 05:28.369
totally cold-blooded.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.830
Don't be

05:28.411 --> 05:29.830
such a baby.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.040
What you did to me

05:29.871 --> 05:32.040
was an act of war.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.834
And believe me,

05:32.082 --> 05:33.834
I  will  get you back.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.377
You won't know where or when,

05:33.875 --> 05:36.377
but you're gonna pay.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.255
You sound funny.

05:41.883 --> 05:42.843
You...

05:42.884 --> 05:44.385
you wanted to see me, sir?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.805
I just got a call

05:44.427 --> 05:46.805
from the sheriff

05:46.847 --> 05:49.432
that a cocksure,

05:46.847 --> 05:49.432
smart-mouthed youth

05:49.474 --> 05:51.685
looking very much like yourself

05:51.726 --> 05:54.437
has been  hustling  pool

05:51.726 --> 05:54.437
at the local bars.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.689
Really, sir?

05:55.730 --> 05:58.066
You are in serious trouble,

05:55.730 --> 05:58.066
cadet.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.067
I can explain...

05:59.109 --> 06:00.485
Why have you been holding back

06:00.527 --> 06:01.903
when we've played pool?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.446
What?

06:03.488 --> 06:06.283
I want to know why

06:03.488 --> 06:06.283
you've been letting me win.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.826
Sir, if I

06:06.325 --> 06:07.826
played for real

06:07.868 --> 06:09.703
I'd just end up

06:07.868 --> 06:09.703
humiliating you

06:09.744 --> 06:12.873
in front of the

06:09.744 --> 06:12.873
whole school, and...

06:12.914 --> 06:15.416
and you'd, you know,

06:12.914 --> 06:15.416
torture us all for it.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.836
Really, nothing good

06:15.458 --> 06:17.836
could come from it, and

06:17.878 --> 06:20.505
and, besides,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.505
winning seems to

06:17.878 --> 06:20.505
make you so happy.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.257
I am not a child.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.633
Do you really think me

06:23.675 --> 06:26.136
so petty that I would throw

06:23.675 --> 06:26.136
a tantrum

06:26.178 --> 06:28.847
over something so small

06:26.178 --> 06:28.847
as a game of pool?!

06:28.889 --> 06:30.682
My mistake, sir.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.267
We are going to play again.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.852
And  you  are going to give me

06:33.894 --> 06:36.146
your best game, cadet.

06:36.188 --> 06:39.482
And to make sure of that,

06:36.188 --> 06:39.482
if you don't win...

06:39.524 --> 06:44.445
picture yourself, 0400, awakened

06:39.524 --> 06:44.445
from sweet dreams of Mommy,

06:44.487 --> 06:46.365
sent outside

06:44.487 --> 06:46.365
into the bitter cold

06:46.405 --> 06:47.532
to raise our school colors

06:47.574 --> 06:49.617
and stand at attention

06:47.574 --> 06:49.617
for three hours

06:49.659 --> 06:50.911
until reveille is called.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.454
Now, picture  that

06:53.496 --> 06:56.457
for 230 consecutive days.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.169
But what if I try my best

06:56.499 --> 06:59.169
and I still lose?

06:59.211 --> 07:01.546
Then you shall be miserable

06:59.211 --> 07:01.546
indeed.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.006
Dismissed.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.094
Remember, honey,

07:04.799 --> 07:07.094
how I promised you

07:07.135 --> 07:08.845
that exotic

07:07.135 --> 07:08.845
island vacation,

07:08.887 --> 07:11.056
but we had to go have

07:08.887 --> 07:11.056
children instead?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.473
Mm-hmm.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.725
Well, I was thinking

07:13.767 --> 07:16.477
maybe today could be

07:13.767 --> 07:16.477
our little island getaway.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.564
We've got the sun,

07:16.519 --> 07:19.564
the sand, the palm trees.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.984
And I brought

07:19.606 --> 07:22.984
the cocktails.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.986
It's Malibu rum

07:23.026 --> 07:24.986
in a lotion bottle

07:25.028 --> 07:26.280
so no one will know

07:25.028 --> 07:26.280
the difference.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.906
(chuckling)

07:27.948 --> 07:32.327
You are so cute when

07:27.948 --> 07:32.327
you sneak in alcohol.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.083
Hey, Reese,

07:35.538 --> 07:38.083
I think I just saw

07:35.538 --> 07:38.083
that girl you liked.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.668
You know, the one

07:38.125 --> 07:40.668
with the really long

07:38.125 --> 07:40.668
blonde hair.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.503
April?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.503
April, that's her.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.089
Why'd you say you

07:42.545 --> 07:44.089
liked her again?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.382
She's real trampy.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.301
I hear she kisses

07:45.424 --> 07:47.301
with tongue.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.219
Is that true, April?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.474
Jerk!

07:55.558 --> 07:57.518
Now  we're even.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.438
You geek, you deserved it!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.522
Ow!

08:01.564 --> 08:03.150
Get out of here!

08:03.191 --> 08:04.525
I think

08:03.191 --> 08:04.525
those are ours.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.987
All right.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.987
No. I'll take

08:04.567 --> 08:06.987
care of it.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.030
Ow!

08:10.240 --> 08:12.993
LOIS:

08:10.240 --> 08:12.993
Malcolm, Reese, knock it off!

08:23.586 --> 08:24.712
Can I watch TV?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.506
No.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.350
Can I play video games?

08:36.391 --> 08:37.517
No.

08:41.396 --> 08:42.772
What can I do?

08:42.814 --> 08:44.024
Something quiet.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.572
(wheels clicking softly)

08:51.614 --> 08:53.408
Quieter.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.540
(man screaming)

09:03.710 --> 09:07.588
(screaming continues)

09:07.630 --> 09:09.841
(crowd screaming)

09:18.308 --> 09:20.477
(woman screams)

09:20.519 --> 09:24.605
(man and woman scream)

09:26.358 --> 09:28.151
I can do this.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.239
(woman screaming)

09:36.284 --> 09:38.828
Keep your arms and legs

09:36.284 --> 09:38.828
crossed at all times.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.621
Do not bend your legs.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.873
Do not raise your head.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.291
Remove all piercings.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.626
You may have nothing

09:43.333 --> 09:45.626
around your neck.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.711
Enjoy the ride.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.839
Okay, here it goes.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.550
On three.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.675
One...

09:52.717 --> 09:55.095
two...

09:55.136 --> 09:59.640
three...!

10:05.855 --> 10:08.358
(giggling)

10:16.491 --> 10:17.658
REESE:

10:16.491 --> 10:17.658
Hey, there, girlie.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.911
Let me adjust your bra strap.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.622
(smacking loudly)

10:21.204 --> 10:22.622
Now  we're even.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.675
Oh, no, no,

10:32.715 --> 10:34.675
no, no.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.970
First, we sort

10:34.717 --> 10:36.970
by the number of holes,

10:37.011 --> 10:38.638
then by color.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.682
What's in your mouth?

10:41.724 --> 10:42.892
Nothing.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.604
There are at least

10:42.934 --> 10:45.604
20 things I will

10:42.934 --> 10:45.604
not tolerate,

10:45.645 --> 10:46.854
and lying is one of them.

10:46.896 --> 10:47.981
Spit it out.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.736
You're eating my buttons.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.572
I wasn't eating.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.572
I was saving.

10:55.614 --> 10:56.739
What are you?

10:55.614 --> 10:56.739
A hamster?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.992
What were you

10:56.781 --> 10:58.992
saving it for?

10:59.033 --> 11:00.201
I don't know.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.036
It's pretty.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.036
It's my favorite one.

11:03.788 --> 11:08.460
You know... actually,

11:03.788 --> 11:08.460
it's my favorite, too.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.796
What do you think

11:09.752 --> 11:11.796
of this one?

11:11.838 --> 11:14.048
It's ugly. I hate it.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.135
So do I.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.805
My, you're a, you're

11:17.177 --> 11:20.805
a smart little boy.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.069
(clears throat)

11:36.154 --> 11:38.448
You seem to be practicing

11:36.154 --> 11:38.448
pretty hard.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.824
I hope you're

11:38.490 --> 11:39.824
not planning

11:39.866 --> 11:41.993
on doing something stupid,

11:39.866 --> 11:41.993
like winning.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.037
Look, guys, I know

11:42.035 --> 11:44.037
you want me to lose,

11:44.078 --> 11:46.331
but Spangler insisted

11:44.078 --> 11:46.331
I play a real game.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.748
Francis, you can't win.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.001
If you do, Spangler's

11:47.790 --> 11:50.001
going to take it out on us.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.212
Remember when Hendrix

11:50.043 --> 11:52.212
beat him playing horse

11:52.253 --> 11:54.047
on a lucky shot?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.840
We couldn't watch anything

11:54.088 --> 11:55.840
but PBS for a week.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.009
And that was during

11:55.882 --> 11:58.009
pledge drive, man.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.594
Guys, come on.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.594
Do you have any idea

11:59.636 --> 12:00.970
what Spangler's going

11:59.636 --> 12:00.970
to do to me if I lose?

12:01.012 --> 12:02.681
(chuckles)

12:02.721 --> 12:05.517
Do you know what we're going

12:02.721 --> 12:05.517
to do to you if you win?

12:28.831 --> 12:30.958
Where were we?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.794
Mom! You have

12:31.000 --> 12:33.794
to stop Reese!

12:33.836 --> 12:35.463
He's being

12:33.836 --> 12:35.463
a total jerk!

12:35.505 --> 12:38.174
Malcolm, does it look like

12:35.505 --> 12:38.174
I'm open for business?

12:38.216 --> 12:40.677
You have done nothing

12:38.216 --> 12:40.677
but pester us.

12:40.719 --> 12:41.720
Is it too much to ask

12:41.760 --> 12:43.680
that your father and I

12:41.760 --> 12:43.680
enjoy one day?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.473
But Reese is the one...

12:43.722 --> 12:45.473
I don't want to hear it.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.100
You either take care

12:45.515 --> 12:47.100
of this yourself

12:47.141 --> 12:48.893
or I'm gonna lock

12:47.141 --> 12:48.893
the two of you in the car

12:48.935 --> 12:51.104
for the rest of the day.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.104
I mean it.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.234
(Reese laughing)

13:01.864 --> 13:03.824
Lifeguard, help!

13:03.866 --> 13:05.619
My brother--

13:03.866 --> 13:05.619
he can't swim.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.079
(whistle blowing)

13:09.497 --> 13:10.831
Out of the way, guys!

13:10.873 --> 13:11.832
Drowning boy!

13:11.874 --> 13:13.000
Out of the way!

13:13.042 --> 13:14.043
Drowning boy!

13:14.085 --> 13:16.045
Drowning boy!

13:16.087 --> 13:17.171
Drowning boy!

13:18.047 --> 13:19.840
Give him some air, guys.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.301
Give him some air.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.301
Back up.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.640
Sir!

13:26.681 --> 13:29.601
Let the people

13:26.681 --> 13:29.601
who work here

13:26.681 --> 13:29.601
do that.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.566
Now we're even.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.155
And then I was playing

13:39.694 --> 13:42.155
with my imaginary friend,

13:42.196 --> 13:43.864
and Reese hit me

13:42.196 --> 13:43.864
because he said

13:43.906 --> 13:46.033
I shouldn't talk to myself.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.120
Well, Reese is a

13:46.075 --> 13:49.120
horrid little boy.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.872
I mean, there's nothing

13:50.622 --> 13:51.872
wrong with having

13:51.914 --> 13:53.792
an imaginary friend.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.376
I talk to my Harold

13:53.832 --> 13:55.376
all the time.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.753
You do?

13:55.418 --> 13:56.753
Of course.

13:56.795 --> 13:57.962
He's here right now.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.380
Would he like a cookie?

13:59.422 --> 14:00.632
Sure.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.384
No, no, no.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.219
He's over there.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.852
Yes!

14:14.937 --> 14:15.980
Sorry, sir.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.899
It's understandable, cadet.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.736
I've seen professionals

14:18.941 --> 14:21.736
do much worse.

14:21.778 --> 14:25.865
I guess the pool gods

14:21.778 --> 14:25.865
are smiling on me today.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.327
(all sighing)

14:29.369 --> 14:31.371
But then, the pool gods

14:29.369 --> 14:31.371
can be fickle.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.372
That's okay, sir.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.914
You'll win the next one.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.333
Sir, what are

14:33.956 --> 14:35.333
you doing?

14:35.375 --> 14:36.543
I think I'm losing.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.586
And gracefully, I'd

14:36.584 --> 14:38.586
like to be noted.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.087
But you could have

14:38.628 --> 14:40.087
made that shot.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.756
I could say

14:40.129 --> 14:41.756
the same thing to you.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.007
There were at least

14:41.798 --> 14:43.007
a dozen shots

14:43.049 --> 14:44.133
that you've held back on.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.302
But since you seem

14:44.175 --> 14:46.302
to be motivated more

14:46.344 --> 14:47.512
by losing,

14:47.554 --> 14:49.013
I'm going to beat you

14:47.554 --> 14:49.013
at your own game.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.014
Huh?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.432
I'm going down, cadet.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.933
I'm going down hard.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.311
But, sir, these guys are going

14:52.975 --> 14:55.311
to kick my ass if I win.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.937
Well, that's just gravy.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.898
May the best man lose.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.030
Fudge! It seems

15:03.695 --> 15:06.030
I've scratched again.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.949
Well, you seem to be

15:06.072 --> 15:08.949
on a roll, cadet.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.023
Before you say

17:43.354 --> 17:45.023
anything, Malcolm,

17:45.105 --> 17:46.106
I just want to tell you,

17:46.148 --> 17:47.984
I don't want to hear it.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.527
Can't you give your mother

17:48.026 --> 17:49.527
and me five minutes of peace?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.779
You know what? You can

17:49.569 --> 17:51.779
have the rest of the day

17:51.821 --> 17:53.489
because I've given up.

17:53.531 --> 17:57.368
I'm not going to have

17:53.531 --> 17:57.368
any fun anyway, so why try?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.203
As long as we're

17:57.410 --> 17:59.203
on the same page.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.122
Today sucked.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.124
I've done nothing

18:02.164 --> 18:04.124
except chicken out,

18:04.166 --> 18:06.126
get laughed at

18:04.166 --> 18:06.126
and fight with Reese.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.337
So now I'm just

18:06.168 --> 18:08.337
going to lie down,

18:08.379 --> 18:13.092
enjoy the sun and wait for them

18:08.379 --> 18:13.092
to take me home.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.851
(groans)

18:21.893 --> 18:25.646
Now  we're even.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.566
(growls)

18:35.114 --> 18:37.116
(laughing)

18:39.077 --> 18:40.578
Now  we're...

18:42.204 --> 18:43.163
(screams)

18:43.205 --> 18:46.000
(growling)

18:52.381 --> 18:54.592
Boys!

19:00.056 --> 19:01.348
Reese,

19:01.390 --> 19:03.183
I've done some soul-searching

19:01.390 --> 19:03.183
in the last few minutes

19:03.225 --> 19:05.227
and hereby offer my complete

19:03.225 --> 19:05.227
and full apology.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.187
It was very wrong of me.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.983
I'm truly sorry for my childish

19:07.229 --> 19:09.983
and inappropriate behavior

19:10.024 --> 19:12.192
and I'd like to think that

19:10.024 --> 19:12.192
the terrible guilt I'm feeling

19:12.234 --> 19:13.193
is punishment enough for...

19:16.614 --> 19:18.574
Hey, there's no

19:16.614 --> 19:18.574
cutting in line.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.784
Oh, it's you again.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.201
Reese, I am

19:19.826 --> 19:21.201
so sorry.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.620
I really, really mean it.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.583
Do you think we're wealthy?!

19:27.625 --> 19:28.709
What?!

19:28.751 --> 19:31.295
Do you think we're wealthy?

19:31.337 --> 19:32.588
Wealthy people

19:32.630 --> 19:33.673
drive fancy cars.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.008
They buy fresh pasta.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.717
Do we do any of those things?

19:37.760 --> 19:39.219
No! Wealthy people

19:39.261 --> 19:41.055
can afford

19:39.261 --> 19:41.055
to have their vacations ruined.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.223
No big deal. They just pick up

19:41.097 --> 19:43.223
and they go again.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.809
Your father and I

19:44.851 --> 19:45.893
work so hard.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.603
We work so long.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.313
What is wrong with you two?!

19:49.355 --> 19:52.232
Are you aborigines?!

19:52.274 --> 19:54.068
Every time I turn around,

19:52.274 --> 19:54.068
I hear someone

19:54.110 --> 19:55.862
screaming and fighting,

19:54.110 --> 19:55.862
and I pray to God

19:55.903 --> 19:57.404
it's someone else's kids,

19:55.903 --> 19:57.404
but it's not.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.405
It's always you!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.700
Sane children

19:58.447 --> 20:00.700
would appreciate this,

20:00.741 --> 20:03.703
but you have to keep nattering

20:00.741 --> 20:03.703
at each other like a couple

20:03.744 --> 20:04.871
of rabid monkeys!

20:04.912 --> 20:07.247
It is not enough

20:04.912 --> 20:07.247
that you do this every day.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.457
You have to make me suffer, too.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.168
So help me!

20:12.294 --> 20:15.297
Don't you dare!

20:21.303 --> 20:22.972
(Lois screaming)

20:23.014 --> 20:26.017
Arms and legs crossed

20:23.014 --> 20:26.017
at all times!

20:27.309 --> 20:30.146
That is the bravest thing

20:27.309 --> 20:30.146
I've ever seen you do.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.313
Yeah.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.984
You're going to die.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.318
I know.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.487
So, do you think

20:36.360 --> 20:38.487
she's okay?

20:38.529 --> 20:40.198
(Lois growling)

20:40.239 --> 20:42.533
(Lois shouting, kids screaming)

20:48.247 --> 20:51.625
(screaming and shouting

20:48.247 --> 20:51.625
continues)

20:55.171 --> 20:57.381
LOIS:

20:55.171 --> 20:57.381
This is the last time

20:55.171 --> 20:57.381
I take you boys anywhere!

21:15.357 --> 21:17.610
Good playing, cadet.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.278
Same to you, sir.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.989
Hey, who won?

21:22.031 --> 21:24.324
Who cares, man?

21:31.874 --> 21:33.876
(people speaking

21:31.874 --> 21:33.876
foreign language)

21:37.046 --> 21:39.090
(car horn honks)
