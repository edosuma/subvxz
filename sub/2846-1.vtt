that we can give them shelter,

can give them an education.

I mean, the girls and...
and the housemothers, they...

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:08.493
they make... they make you
feel like you're family.

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:11.462
Like you're loved.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:13.587
Like...

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.731
like you're worth something, and...

01:33:16.358 --> 01:33:19.161
and you can achieve
a lot of things.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:24.465
You know, it's... it's...

01:33:24.466 --> 01:33:29.511
It's crazy how you can go
and live with strangers

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:33.851
and feel... feel so much joy

01:33:35.677 --> 01:33:39.948
and not feel like...
like you're any different.

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:44.351
And... and... and not...

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:46.791
not feel unwanted.

01:33:49.557 --> 01:33:54.465
And feeling you can go
places in your life and...

01:33:57.232 --> 01:34:01.344
and succeed in life.

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:19.564
Apple

01:34:20.722 --> 01:34:22.399
it's okay.

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:24.897
It's all right.

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:29.536
It's all right.

01:34:36.905 --> 01:34:38.309
All right.

01:34:40.108 --> 01:34:41.751
I understand.

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.180
I understand.

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:51.726
Look, I know I could be
your daughter someday,

01:34:53.388 --> 01:34:55.531
but I just need some time.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.170
Can you give me that?

01:35:09.104 --> 01:35:11.179
Yep, I can do that.
