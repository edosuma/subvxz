Mr. Hixton, is everything all right?

00:35.279 --> 00:36.265
Mr. Hixton?

00:37.661 --> 00:39.057
Kill me now.

00:39.437 --> 00:41.284
You got the cell phone bill?

00:41.285 --> 00:45.125
No. Uh, books from my publisher
for back cover quotes.

00:45.126 --> 00:48.011
Wait. What about the cell phone bill?

00:48.012 --> 00:48.894
Nothing.

00:50.523 --> 00:53.236
Ah, more books to endorse.

00:53.237 --> 00:55.484
You couldn't possibly read them all.

00:55.485 --> 00:59.281
Don't have to.
"A Tour de Force in Terror. Richard Castle."

01:00.549 --> 01:03.406
"Does for hot tubs
what 'Jaws' did for the ocean."

01:03.407 --> 01:06.083
Gram, there's a letter for you.
Looks official.

01:06.256 --> 01:09.110
"Bachman & Sabasto"?
Oh. Chet's estate lawyer.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.067
They probably resolved the probate.

01:11.983 --> 01:12.675
You okay?

01:12.676 --> 01:15.872
This memory of him caught me by surprise.

01:15.873 --> 01:18.135
Do you think he left you
anything in his will?

01:18.136 --> 01:20.701
Well, he certainly didn't need to,
but if...

01:22.009 --> 01:22.946
Oh, my.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.811
Mother, what's wrong?

01:26.882 --> 01:27.765
I...

01:34.377 --> 01:35.604
$1 million?

01:35.873 --> 01:37.520
Your mom must be in shock.

01:37.521 --> 01:39.317
Any idea what she's gonna do with it?

01:39.401 --> 01:42.221
If I'm lucky, get a place of her own.
Yeah, that would be lucky.

01:42.222 --> 01:44.843
You can't buy much in Manhattan
for 1 million bucks.

01:46.437 --> 01:47.319
Wow.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.352
Foosball, basketball, a motorcycle...

01:50.879 --> 01:52.270
I'll bet the owner of this place

01:52.271 --> 01:54.035
clearly had ten times that.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.587
Try a hundred.

01:56.191 --> 01:59.157
Victim's name is Jay Hixton.
He won a cool $117 mil

01:59.158 --> 02:00.801
in the Florida lottery last year.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.482
And then he went
on a serious shopping spree.

02:03.483 --> 02:05.946
Rookie mistake.
Sounds like the voice of experience.

02:05.947 --> 02:08.503
Mm-hmm. Writing a best seller
in college is a lot like

02:08.505 --> 02:09.910
winning the lottery.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.664
I spent every penny of it in six months.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.578
Good thing I'm not a one-hit wonder.
Single gunshot to the chest.

02:15.579 --> 02:18.603
From the stippling and bruising,
I'd say there was a struggle,

02:18.604 --> 02:20.690
the gun went off, vaporized his heart,

02:20.691 --> 02:23.294
somewhere between 11:00
and 2:00 last night.

02:23.379 --> 02:26.293
That's a big gun.
It's too big for that entry wound.

02:26.622 --> 02:28.255
This isn't the murder weapon.

02:28.498 --> 02:30.381
Told you she'd spot it first off.

02:30.382 --> 02:33.295
Our victim was shot
with a 9-millimeter automatic.

02:33.296 --> 02:34.270
The bullet went straight through him.

02:34.271 --> 02:36.702
We pulled the slug out of the poker table.

02:36.703 --> 02:40.813
Okay, so maybe our killer
forces Hixton to open the safe,

02:40.814 --> 02:43.473
the .357 is hidden inside.

02:43.474 --> 02:47.146
Hixton pulls it out, they struggle,

02:47.221 --> 02:50.836
and he gets shot.
That's the winning ticket.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.688
Hard to believe a little slip
of paper is worth over $100 mil.

02:54.031 --> 02:55.746
What would you do
if you won that kind of money?

02:55.747 --> 02:59.257
Easy. Buy a Ferrari.
I have one. Not as great as you would think.

02:59.258 --> 03:00.253
Yeah, but they're hella fast.

03:00.254 --> 03:02.512
Fast as every other car
in rush-hour traffic.

03:02.513 --> 03:04.075
Any idea how much money was in here?

03:04.076 --> 03:06.967
$100,000, secured in a bank bag.

03:06.968 --> 03:10.549
Uh, this is Reginald Easley.
He's Mr. Hixton's servant.

03:10.550 --> 03:14.385
Servant? Young man,
I am a traditional English butler.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.404
I apprenticed at Buckingham Palace.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.268
Did he always keep that much
hard cash in the safe?

03:18.269 --> 03:21.043
Mr. Hixton came from
an impoverished background.

03:21.044 --> 03:23.782
He found having hard currency
around reassuring.

03:23.783 --> 03:26.386
How many people knew that it was there?
Dozens, no doubt.

03:26.387 --> 03:28.462
He had a habit of buying
everything in sight,

03:28.463 --> 03:30.403
no thought to how much money
he was flashing around

03:30.404 --> 03:32.707
or how dangerous it was to tell people

03:32.708 --> 03:34.517
that there was plenty more of it at home.

03:34.518 --> 03:35.544
In New York, that's like

03:35.545 --> 03:37.909
inviting someone back
to your house to kill you.

03:38.106 --> 03:41.018
Did he keep that gun in the safe?
That's the odd thing, miss.

03:41.019 --> 03:42.815
I know every item in this apartment.

03:42.816 --> 03:45.612
I have never seen a gun.
Oh, but I do know

03:45.613 --> 03:46.649
he kept a dye pack in the

03:46.650 --> 03:48.737
bag that was stolen.
And how is it triggered?

03:48.738 --> 03:50.345
It was on a 3-minute timer that began

03:50.346 --> 03:51.815
when the bag left the apartment.

03:51.816 --> 03:53.939
All right, grab some uniforms,
canvass the area.

03:53.940 --> 03:55.202
The killer couldn't have gotten very far

03:55.203 --> 03:57.093
before that pack exploded.

03:57.808 --> 04:00.165
When was the last time you saw Hixton?
Yesterday evening.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.867
He left about 5:00.

04:01.868 --> 04:04.383
I believe he had made plans with his wife.

04:04.426 --> 04:05.578
He was married?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.705
Oh, yes, with a teenage daughter.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.179
They'd been separated for some months

04:09.180 --> 04:11.071
before I began to work for him.

04:11.356 --> 04:14.232
Apparently, the money caused
some kind of a rift.

04:16.611 --> 04:18.281
We were so happy then.

04:18.283 --> 04:21.630
Trips to Paris and trips to Rome and...

04:22.515 --> 04:25.095
Cars with heated seats and...

04:26.666 --> 04:28.880
Then everyone started
looking at us different.

04:29.075 --> 04:30.421
Like we were freaks.

04:30.685 --> 04:34.034
You could see them thinking, why you?
Why not me?

04:34.186 --> 04:36.255
And nothing we did was good enough.

04:36.659 --> 04:39.960
So we moved here.
It was supposed to be a fresh start.

04:40.523 --> 04:42.590
Why were the two of you separated?

04:42.594 --> 04:45.775
That money, it was... just like poison.

04:46.762 --> 04:48.702
Jay couldn't stop spending it,

04:48.703 --> 04:51.368
and... and Nicole...

04:52.714 --> 04:53.888
It's okay, mom.

04:55.514 --> 04:57.174
Nicole got hooked on drugs.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.422
And it was the wake-up call
we needed, really.

05:00.546 --> 05:04.141
Jay and I went from not talking
to getting Nicole clean.

05:05.007 --> 05:07.495
And then he started using
his money for good.

05:07.806 --> 05:09.437
He found this soup kitchen on the Bowery

05:09.438 --> 05:11.027
that was in dire straits.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.652
He said that looking
at all those people in need

05:13.743 --> 05:16.467
just reminded him, if...
if it wasn't for that lottery,

05:16.512 --> 05:18.144
we'd be right there ourselves.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.876
He started going there almost every day.

05:21.743 --> 05:23.771
And it just reminded me of how much...

05:24.134 --> 05:25.532
How much I love him.

05:26.234 --> 05:28.606
Where was it the two of you ended up
going last night?

05:29.050 --> 05:29.666
Last night?

05:29.667 --> 05:32.275
His butler said that
the two of you had a date.

05:32.276 --> 05:35.195
No. Jay called to cancel
at the last minute.

05:35.196 --> 05:36.899
He told me something had happened,

05:36.900 --> 05:39.262
something that we had
to deal with together.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.573
And I tried to get him
to tell me what it was,

05:41.646 --> 05:44.707
but he wouldn't.
And where did he call from?

05:44.708 --> 05:47.063
The Bowery soup kitchen, I-I think.

05:47.064 --> 05:48.504
It's where we were supposed to meet.

05:48.505 --> 05:50.848
And did he have problems
with anyone there that you know of?

05:50.849 --> 05:55.182
No one in particular.
It was a pretty rough crowd.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.097
All my years as a mystery writer

05:58.098 --> 06:00.061
point to one unequivocal killer.

06:00.473 --> 06:01.920
The butler did it.
Oh.

06:01.921 --> 06:04.379
Oh, come on. How many cases
have we actually had

06:04.380 --> 06:06.634
where there's a-a butler
as a potential suspect?

06:06.635 --> 06:08.111
It would be a crime if he didn't do it.

06:08.112 --> 06:09.456
And then he shows up the next

06:09.457 --> 06:11.768
morning and calls the cops?
Pretty clever, right?

06:11.769 --> 06:13.612
Change? Speaking of clever,
I noticed at the crime scene,

06:13.613 --> 06:14.356
you never mentioned what you

06:14.357 --> 06:16.293
would do if you won the lottery.
No, I didn't.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.888
Is that because it's embarrassing?
Ooh, scandalous?

06:18.889 --> 06:20.736
I actually haven't really
thought about it, Castle.

06:20.737 --> 06:24.323
So not embarrassing or scandalous,
just secretive.

06:26.905 --> 06:28.349
Bad news travels fast.

06:29.588 --> 06:31.354
The man was generous to a fault.

06:31.677 --> 06:32.683
When he first started coming here,

06:32.684 --> 06:36.065
he'd hand out $100 bills like...
like they were nothing.

06:36.066 --> 06:38.196
Got so bad, I had to ask him to stop.

06:38.197 --> 06:41.642
Why?
Well, we were attracting a bad element.

06:41.643 --> 06:44.141
Still, I'd see Mr. Hixton sneak money

06:44.142 --> 06:47.193
to a pregnant woman or homeless kid.

06:47.194 --> 06:50.217
It was a compulsion for him,
like he had to give it away

06:50.218 --> 06:52.268
'cause he didn't deserve it somehow.

06:52.269 --> 06:53.474
Winner's guilt.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.889
It's actually quite common
with lottery recipients.

06:55.890 --> 06:58.297
Did anything suspicious
happen with Mr. Hixton

06:58.298 --> 06:59.696
when he was here last night?

06:59.697 --> 07:02.151
Now that you mention it, yeah.

07:02.152 --> 07:05.672
A man was hanging around
a good part of the afternoon.

07:05.729 --> 07:08.086
Someone you didn't know?
I'd never seen him before,

07:08.087 --> 07:09.577
but he went right up to Mr. Hixton

07:09.578 --> 07:12.207
when he arrived at 6:00,
like he knew him, you know?

07:12.208 --> 07:15.165
A few minutes later,
he left and never came back.

07:15.279 --> 07:17.766
Do you think you could describe
him to a sketch artist?

07:18.274 --> 07:19.086
So our mystery man

07:19.087 --> 07:21.571
goes to the soup kitchen, waits for Hixton,

07:21.664 --> 07:24.332
and then takes him where?

07:24.333 --> 07:25.815
He wasn't killed for another six hours.

07:25.816 --> 07:28.229
And why wait?
I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton,

07:28.230 --> 07:30.511
why not just take him home
and empty his safe?

07:30.512 --> 07:32.170
And then there's Hixton's gun.

07:32.279 --> 07:34.542
Why did he need it and where did he get it?

07:34.543 --> 07:36.700
Well, according to C.S.U., nowhere legal.

07:36.984 --> 07:38.943
The serial numbers were filed off the gun,

07:38.944 --> 07:42.050
and Hixton's prints were
on the bullets in the chamber,

07:42.051 --> 07:43.674
which means he loaded it himself.

07:43.675 --> 07:45.274
Found our lottery winner's money bag.

07:45.275 --> 07:48.310
Where'd you find it?
Alley behind Hixton's building.

07:48.311 --> 07:49.494
It was empty, but as you can see,

07:49.495 --> 07:51.424
the dye pack in the bag went off.

07:51.425 --> 07:52.859
And it must have gotten
on our killer's hands,

07:52.860 --> 07:57.564
because we got prints
belonging to one Todd Shipley,

07:57.565 --> 07:59.588
a maintenance worker in Hixton's building.

07:59.589 --> 08:01.783
He got off right around
the time that Hixton was killed.

08:01.784 --> 08:03.228
Yeah, but if he's a maintenance worker,

08:03.229 --> 08:04.141
he could've picked up the bag

08:04.142 --> 08:06.594
after the dye pack went off.
I don't think so.

08:14.168 --> 08:16.376
Either that guy really likes "Avatar"...

08:16.377 --> 08:17.804
Or he's our killer.

08:18.597 --> 08:20.208
I swear. I found the bag on the ground,

08:20.209 --> 08:22.158
and when I opened it,
it went off in my face.

08:22.159 --> 08:23.830
That bag was on a 3-minute timer.

08:23.831 --> 08:25.195
Are you telling us that you

08:25.196 --> 08:27.211
accidentally picked it up at exactly

08:27.212 --> 08:29.666
the the wrong time?
Man, I'm telling the truth.

08:29.715 --> 08:31.966
I-I had just gotten off work,
stopped to get a soda,

08:31.967 --> 08:33.711
when I saw someone running out
of the alley.

08:33.712 --> 08:36.419
This, uh, someone that ran away,
what did they look like?

08:36.419 --> 08:38.884
I-I don't know. It... it was dark.
So's your future, Todd,

08:38.885 --> 08:40.296
if you don't start telling us the truth.

08:40.297 --> 08:44.952
Man, I am.
Yo, ask Mr. Lee at the Korean grocery.

08:44.953 --> 08:47.077
He... he... he's the one
that sold me the soda.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.225
Timer was set for three minutes.
There's no way he could've

08:50.226 --> 08:51.945
gotten downstairs from the 20th floor

08:51.946 --> 08:54.906
and bought a drink before
the dye pack exploded.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.584
All right, tell me this...
Did you see Hixton in the building

08:58.585 --> 09:00.281
at all during your shift?
Yeah.

09:00.282 --> 09:02.912
I was in the lobby when he came home,
around 11:00.

09:03.289 --> 09:05.356
Uh, he was sweating
like he had been walking.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.116
And since he left earlier
in his Escalade, I asked him

09:07.117 --> 09:10.040
where his car was.
He said someone had taken it from him.

09:10.041 --> 09:12.509
So Mr. Lee confirmed Shipley's alibi.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.571
And Hixton's car is definitely missing.

09:14.572 --> 09:15.716
Well, it can't be a coincidence

09:15.717 --> 09:18.396
that on the same day Hixton's car
was taken, he was killed.

09:18.397 --> 09:19.855
The killer could've gotten
Hixton's home key

09:19.856 --> 09:20.800
when he took his ride.

09:20.801 --> 09:23.318
Address was on the registration.
He liked the car so much,

09:23.319 --> 09:24.534
he drove over to rob the apartment,

09:24.535 --> 09:27.753
got caught in the act.
Yeah, but why would Hixton go home?

09:27.754 --> 09:30.628
- Why wouldn't he call the police,
report the theft? - Okay.

09:31.295 --> 09:33.918
Tracking company's got a lock
on Hixton's Escalade.

09:36.635 --> 09:38.800
Looks like it's heading
west on Canal Street.

09:39.153 --> 09:42.513
That's the Holland Tunnel.
Our killer's making a run for it.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.025
Name's Shawn York.

09:51.026 --> 09:53.487
Jersey police caught him
driving Hixton's car down the turnpike.

09:53.488 --> 09:54.718
No sign of the stolen money, though.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.230
No disrespect to our Jersey brethren,

09:56.231 --> 09:58.618
but let's check that car again,
make sure that that money's

09:58.619 --> 09:59.531
not hidden behind a door

09:59.532 --> 10:01.763
panel or inside the wheel well.
You got it.

10:02.422 --> 10:05.315
Hey, Ryan. What would you do
if you won the lottery?

10:05.320 --> 10:06.316
Winery.

10:06.848 --> 10:09.275
See? Everyone thinks about it.

10:10.063 --> 10:11.453
Everybody thinks about what?

10:11.823 --> 10:13.240
What they would do if they won the lottery.

10:13.241 --> 10:15.059
A big-ass boat... 60-footer...

10:15.060 --> 10:17.101
Monster spinnaker hanging off the bow,

10:17.102 --> 10:20.741
two deep-sea rods
hanging off the stern. Mm.

10:20.742 --> 10:22.881
Sweet. Okay, while you guys are fantasizing

10:22.882 --> 10:24.077
about the size of your rods,

10:24.078 --> 10:26.305
I'm gonna go and interrogate our suspect.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.155
Can I get a...

10:33.621 --> 10:34.633
Soda?

10:35.421 --> 10:36.992
I'm not your flight attendant.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.512
I'm a homicide detective.

10:42.196 --> 10:43.398
Homicide?

10:43.413 --> 10:44.881
You're a bit of a rambler, Shawn.

10:44.882 --> 10:46.646
Assault in El Paso,

10:46.647 --> 10:48.519
criminal trespass in Memphis,

10:48.520 --> 10:51.039
and now first-degree murder
in New York City.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.428
Wait. Time-out.

10:52.859 --> 10:54.820
Who did I kill?

10:54.892 --> 10:56.269
Jay Hixton.

10:56.278 --> 10:58.651
No. He was alive when I saw him.

10:58.652 --> 11:01.028
That was at the soup kitchen
where you jacked his car,

11:01.029 --> 11:04.278
but then you got greedy and
you followed him to his apartment.

11:04.513 --> 11:06.828
He ends up dead,
you end up 100 grand richer.

11:06.829 --> 11:08.316
I didn't kill the guy.

11:08.340 --> 11:10.631
And I sure as hell didn't steal his car.

11:10.632 --> 11:12.815
Well, then how did you
end up driving his car?

11:12.816 --> 11:14.051
He gave it to me.

11:14.696 --> 11:18.131
He gave you a $70,000 car?
Why would he do that?

11:19.934 --> 11:20.975
Look, I heard on the street,

11:20.976 --> 11:22.712
Hixton believed in second chances,

11:22.713 --> 11:26.334
so I tracked him down, told him
I was down on my luck.

11:26.335 --> 11:29.139
And Hixton said that
he didn't have his checkbook,

11:29.192 --> 11:31.658
but did I want his car?

11:32.153 --> 11:34.637
I thought he was yanking my chain.

11:34.638 --> 11:35.863
Who does that?

11:36.314 --> 11:38.289
But, you know, he signed over the title

11:38.290 --> 11:40.014
and handed me the keys.

11:40.944 --> 11:43.781
He just signed over the title,
just like that?

11:43.792 --> 11:45.085
Yes, ma'am.

11:45.485 --> 11:47.706
Said he wasn't gonna need it anymore.

11:47.845 --> 11:49.650
Where were you last night at midnight?

11:49.732 --> 11:52.489
I went to the late movie near my apartment.

11:52.623 --> 11:54.996
They're having a Tony JAA marathon.

11:55.665 --> 11:58.145
Can I have that soda now?

11:58.989 --> 12:01.053
Theater clerk confirms
selling York the ticket,

12:01.054 --> 12:04.572
and Hixton's signature
on the car title is authentic.

12:04.901 --> 12:06.460
Who gives away their car?

12:06.461 --> 12:08.793
Someone who can afford
to buy a thousand new ones.

12:08.794 --> 12:12.559
So at 6:00, Hixton gives York his car,
and then at 8:00,

12:12.560 --> 12:15.159
he calls his wife and cancels dinner.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.168
Told her that there's something
they need to talk about,

12:17.169 --> 12:20.137
something that they both need
to deal with together.

12:20.138 --> 12:22.345
Then he gets home at 11:00,
and about an hour later,

12:22.346 --> 12:25.096
he's killed. So what was he
doing in the meantime

12:25.097 --> 12:27.970
and with whom?
You know the guy did like to spend money?

12:27.971 --> 12:29.636
If he made any charges
on his credit card last night,

12:29.637 --> 12:31.627
it might give us a clue as to where he was.

12:31.628 --> 12:34.769
If he spent any money
the night he was killed, it was cash.

12:34.770 --> 12:36.925
There were no charges
on any of his 32 credit cards.

12:36.926 --> 12:40.550
32 credit cards?
Yeah. One for every NFL team.

12:40.571 --> 12:42.081
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

12:42.082 --> 12:44.012
He also bought a racehorse,

12:44.013 --> 12:46.838
minority stake in a lingerie football team,

12:46.839 --> 12:48.269
and a Bentley, which is currently

12:48.270 --> 12:49.510
at the bottom of the Hudson River

12:49.511 --> 12:51.662
because he drove it off
of a boat he was renting.

12:51.663 --> 12:53.790
Wow. Sounds like that money
really turned Hixton

12:53.791 --> 12:55.500
into a different person for a little while.

12:55.501 --> 12:56.975
Yeah, money doesn't change who you are.

12:56.976 --> 13:00.115
It just magnifies your personality.

13:00.116 --> 13:01.248
Well, it wasn't all bad.

13:01.249 --> 13:02.908
He also bought a house

13:02.909 --> 13:04.659
for the clerk that sold him
the winning ticket,

13:04.660 --> 13:07.003
a mausoleum for his dead neighbor,

13:07.004 --> 13:10.953
and 3 acres on the moon.
Get outta town.

13:11.757 --> 13:13.400
He's right down the crater from me.

13:13.401 --> 13:14.359
Why doesn't it surprise me that you

13:14.360 --> 13:16.883
have property on the moon?
You know what? Laugh it up.

13:16.884 --> 13:18.588
When the earth is a desiccated husk,

13:18.589 --> 13:19.636
you will be begging to

13:19.637 --> 13:22.050
come live with me in the nectaris basin.
Hey.

13:22.188 --> 13:23.620
So I searched the car.

13:23.621 --> 13:26.304
Oh.
Yeah, sorry. York is not our guy.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.089
That's okay. Jersey impound lot's
nice this time of year.

13:29.090 --> 13:32.658
So no money, as expected, but I did find this.
A camera?

13:32.659 --> 13:35.999
Lodged under the front seat.
Clearly it belongs to Hixton.

13:37.930 --> 13:38.772
These are surveillance photos.

13:38.773 --> 13:41.796
Yeah, a dozen of 'em,
date stamped last week.

13:41.797 --> 13:43.414
Hixton was following this guy.

13:43.415 --> 13:44.535
All right, contact the family and butler,

13:44.536 --> 13:47.264
see if anyone recognizes him.
Meanwhile, we've got a hole

13:47.265 --> 13:49.206
in our timeline that needs to be plugged.

13:49.207 --> 13:52.202
So we know that Hixton
called his wife at 8:00 P.M.

13:52.203 --> 13:54.382
And we know he wasn't at the soup kitchen.

13:54.383 --> 13:57.363
- Let's ping the carrier, see if they know
where he was. - All right.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.180
What?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.035
Would you quit your job?

14:04.121 --> 14:06.180
If you won the lottery,
would you quit being a cop?

14:06.181 --> 14:07.889
Well, what else would I do?

14:08.628 --> 14:11.145
Super model, brain surgeon,

14:11.269 --> 14:13.925
American gladiator.
Oh, you got me there, Castle.

14:13.926 --> 14:15.462
I've always wanted to leave the force

14:15.463 --> 14:18.323
and become an American gladiator.
Why don't you want to tell me?

14:18.324 --> 14:20.295
Because there's nothing really to tell.

14:20.591 --> 14:22.952
Come on. You must have a dream.
Sure I do.

14:23.164 --> 14:26.175
Solve this case, go home,
take a nice long bath.

14:26.221 --> 14:29.255
But it doesn't look like that's
going to happen tonight.

14:29.629 --> 14:30.971
Hixton's phone carrier.

14:30.972 --> 14:32.303
Hey, Esposito.

14:32.567 --> 14:33.971
That phone call to Hixton's wife

14:33.972 --> 14:35.730
came from the 500 block of Lexington.

14:35.731 --> 14:37.467
I don't think we can get
a more exact address,

14:37.468 --> 14:39.649
so we're gonna have to canvass.
Well, maybe not.

14:39.650 --> 14:42.238
I-I just saw Lexington Avenue
in his financials.

14:43.906 --> 14:46.062
Yeah. Right here.

14:47.338 --> 14:49.889
He wrote 2 checks last month, $10,000 each,

14:49.890 --> 14:52.554
to a company called Meech Industries.

14:52.555 --> 14:55.731
Meech? Logan Meech?
Yeah, he's listed here as the owner.

14:55.732 --> 14:57.543
You know him?
Yeah, I must have arrested the guy,

14:57.544 --> 15:00.236
like, half a dozen times.
He's a low-rent scam artist

15:00.237 --> 15:02.085
with a history of violence.

15:02.086 --> 15:02.949
Last time I busted him,

15:02.950 --> 15:03.998
he was trying to grill cheese

15:03.999 --> 15:06.308
a guy in a dry cleaning press.
Why would Hixton

15:06.309 --> 15:08.337
be writing checks to a character like that?

15:12.126 --> 15:13.450
Logan Meech.

15:14.445 --> 15:15.738
Detective.

15:15.838 --> 15:17.500
I love what you've done with your...

15:17.501 --> 15:18.447
Sit down.

15:21.068 --> 15:22.021
Hey.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.521
Who's the new guy?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.673
Why, you want to send him
Christmas cards from death row?

15:27.028 --> 15:30.226
What? Wait. I didn't kill anybody.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.045
So it's just a coincidence
that you were with Jay Hixton

15:33.046 --> 15:36.056
shortly before he was shot
to death in his apartment?

15:36.733 --> 15:38.467
What? Hixton's dead?

15:38.694 --> 15:41.687
Uh, he was one of my investors.

15:41.688 --> 15:42.579
Really?

15:43.529 --> 15:45.597
What is it Mr. Hixton was investing in?

15:45.912 --> 15:48.411
My relief organization.

15:49.025 --> 15:49.816
Why is it I'm thinking,

15:49.817 --> 15:51.992
the only relief Mr. Hixton's money provided

15:51.993 --> 15:53.771
was to your own bank account?

15:53.772 --> 15:55.599
Did Hixton get on to your scamming him?

15:55.600 --> 15:56.775
Did he threaten to go to the cops?

15:56.776 --> 16:00.032
Is that why you killed him?
I told you, I didn't kill him.

16:00.033 --> 16:02.296
I-I hadn't seen him in weeks.
That's funny,

16:02.297 --> 16:04.112
because I talked to your landlord,
and he said that

16:04.113 --> 16:07.972
he remembers clearly seeing
Hixton at your place last night.

16:08.098 --> 16:10.607
So either you start telling us
the truth and playing ball,

16:10.608 --> 16:13.281
or I call the D.A. and get them
to draw up murder charges.

16:13.282 --> 16:15.411
Okay, look, hang on a minute now.

16:15.412 --> 16:19.845
Um, maybe, I, uh, I misspoke, okay?

16:19.846 --> 16:20.767
Um...

16:21.268 --> 16:24.937
Hixton did actually pay
me a visit last night.

16:25.395 --> 16:26.376
Why?

16:28.548 --> 16:29.704
He wanted a gun.

16:30.763 --> 16:33.146
For what?
Uh, protection. He was scared.

16:33.147 --> 16:35.132
He paid me a grand for a-a .357

16:35.133 --> 16:37.544
that I was holding for a friend.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.382
What was he scared of?

16:39.383 --> 16:40.550
His past.

16:41.843 --> 16:44.234
He said it was coming back to get him.

16:46.132 --> 16:47.321
What's that mean, his past was

16:47.322 --> 16:49.764
coming back to get him?
And why go to Meech for a gun?

16:49.765 --> 16:52.295
Why not just go to the
police or hire a bodyguard?

16:52.296 --> 16:54.190
Maybe he didn't think
they could protect him.

16:54.191 --> 16:56.710
C.S.U. finished processing
Hixton's apartment, came across

16:56.711 --> 16:58.671
two sets of fingerprints
that were in the system.

16:58.672 --> 17:01.811
Couple of career criminals from
Hixton's hometown in Florida.

17:02.264 --> 17:05.742
Greg and Ty Page.
Previous busts for bank robbery

17:05.742 --> 17:08.335
and currently serving a
nickel for grand larceny.

17:08.336 --> 17:10.403
Yeah, well, that info's
a little bit behind.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.607
They were released last week
due to overcrowding.

17:13.608 --> 17:15.174
Yeah, get to the part about
who they robbed.

17:15.175 --> 17:18.071
Hixton.
A month after he collected his jackpot.

17:18.073 --> 17:19.308
Even though they wore ski masks,

17:19.309 --> 17:20.869
he recognized them by their voices

17:20.871 --> 17:22.540
because they grew up together.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.003
It was his testimony that put them away.

17:25.005 --> 17:26.436
Hixton must have heard
they were being released

17:26.438 --> 17:27.910
and worried they were
coming after him again.

17:27.911 --> 17:29.032
According to Florida Police,

17:29.033 --> 17:30.831
the brothers were in town
for all of two days

17:30.832 --> 17:33.139
before the packed up their car
and headed up north.

17:33.140 --> 17:36.075
Told a neighbor that they were
going hunting.

17:36.076 --> 17:38.473
Looks like they bagged themselves
a lottery winner.

17:43.457 --> 17:44.247
Whoa!

17:44.248 --> 17:46.007
Looks like you made a serious dent

17:46.008 --> 17:47.932
in your surprise inheritance.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.247
Is it safe to say there is
not an animal print left

17:50.248 --> 17:53.155
in any store in New York City?
Very funny.

17:53.999 --> 17:55.236
Probably true.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.038
Well, congratulations.

17:58.039 --> 18:00.398
Looks like you have successfully
completed the first stage

18:00.399 --> 18:03.975
in the five stages of hitting
the jackpot...shopping.

18:03.976 --> 18:05.236
What's the next stage?

18:05.237 --> 18:07.363
Well, if you were my
lottery-winning victim,

18:07.364 --> 18:08.736
you'd turn to charity,

18:08.757 --> 18:10.682
and then get shot to death
in your living room.

18:11.573 --> 18:12.641
I'll pass.

18:12.869 --> 18:16.746
Besides, I've decided
to give back the money.

18:16.812 --> 18:18.512
What? Why?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.863
Richard, I was about to
break up with the man.

18:20.864 --> 18:22.644
Do you really think he
would've left me that money

18:22.645 --> 18:23.673
if he'd know that?

18:23.674 --> 18:25.433
No, no. I'm gonna return all this stuff.

18:25.434 --> 18:29.430
I'm gonna give back the money.
It's the right thing to do.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.655
Well, you've just jumped to stage five.

18:32.452 --> 18:33.726
Enlightenment.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.073
Then again, Chet did adore me,

18:37.074 --> 18:40.175
so I think I should be
able to keep one thing.

18:40.875 --> 18:41.990
It's not real.

18:45.164 --> 18:46.614
Ah, detective Beckett.

18:47.130 --> 18:49.262
Did you call to tell me a bedtime story?

18:56.867 --> 18:58.002
Which car is theirs?

18:58.003 --> 18:59.985
The maroon one over there.
Florida plates.

18:59.986 --> 19:02.075
It's registered to a Greg Page.

19:02.076 --> 19:04.334
We put an alert on their plate number,

19:04.335 --> 19:06.498
which got triggered when a
traffic cop ticketed them

19:06.499 --> 19:07.794
about an hour ago.

19:07.795 --> 19:09.597
Any idea where they are?

19:09.745 --> 19:10.718
None.

19:11.266 --> 19:14.079
So we watch the car until someone shows up.

19:15.018 --> 19:16.341
Any sign yet?

19:16.468 --> 19:17.655
That's a negative.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.127
A winery, huh?

19:23.128 --> 19:26.074
Jenny and I visited one on
our first vacation together.

19:26.075 --> 19:28.963
$100 mil, and you're gonna become a farmer?

19:28.964 --> 19:31.240
The fiancée really has done
some damage on you, bro.

19:31.241 --> 19:33.338
Like Lanie hasn't changed you?
Lanie?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.894
Come on, dude.
We... we all know about the two of you.

19:38.907 --> 19:40.623
Castle and Beckett know, too?

19:41.579 --> 19:44.410
You said earlier that
money doesn't change us,

19:44.411 --> 19:47.431
it just magnifies who we are.

19:48.731 --> 19:51.247
W-what did your windfall magnify in you?

19:51.248 --> 19:53.775
My inner child... at first.

19:53.914 --> 19:55.182
Kind of like Hixton.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.159
The one who likes, you know,

19:57.769 --> 20:00.119
private jets, five-star everything.

20:00.514 --> 20:01.267
But then I realized,

20:01.268 --> 20:04.294
the only luxury I truly
care about is freedom.

20:05.019 --> 20:08.312
You know, freedom to write,
to spend time with Alexis.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.982
Having that money just...

20:11.818 --> 20:13.692
Allows me to live life on my terms.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.007
You grew up.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

20:17.209 --> 20:18.775
That property on the moon?
Mm-hmm.

20:18.776 --> 20:20.306
I just bought that last month.

20:23.206 --> 20:24.410
And who is this guy?

20:26.120 --> 20:27.725
Yo, dreadlocks, 12:00.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.043
NYPD, let me see your hands.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.163
Page brothers, where are they?
Upstairs.

21:21.818 --> 21:22.607
What the hell, yo?

21:22.608 --> 21:23.807
That was slammin'.

21:24.253 --> 21:26.360
Three armed cops and a writer makes four,

21:26.361 --> 21:28.944
you're under arrest, so get on the floor.

21:30.604 --> 21:32.275
Got about 60 grand here.

21:32.276 --> 21:33.243
Where's the other $40,000

21:33.244 --> 21:35.255
you took from Hixton's safe
when you killed him?

21:35.256 --> 21:36.901
You spend it on your rap career?

21:36.902 --> 21:38.378
Nah, you got it all wrong, shorty.

21:38.379 --> 21:39.582
We didn't kill the man.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.990
We came up here to help him.

21:40.991 --> 21:43.307
Got out the joint for good behavior.

21:43.308 --> 21:45.532
Dude called us up, said he needed a savoir.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.917
Stop rapping.
I'll buy the album.

21:48.739 --> 21:49.651
Savior?

21:50.095 --> 21:52.726
Yeah. His daughter got back into the drugs.

21:52.727 --> 21:55.000
He needed to make things right,
so he called us.

21:55.001 --> 21:58.176
The two of you robbed Hixton
at gunpoint in Florida.

21:58.177 --> 22:00.358
Why would he call you?
When Hixton realized

22:00.359 --> 22:01.929
what kind of trouble Nicole was in,

22:01.930 --> 22:03.968
he knew we were the only people
he could turn to.

22:03.969 --> 22:06.158
And what could you possibly do
to help his daughter

22:06.159 --> 22:07.266
with her addiction?

22:07.267 --> 22:09.912
Problem wasn't the drugs.
It was her dealer.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.244
A cat named Oz.

22:11.245 --> 22:13.605
Nicole was under his spell
somethin' fierce.

22:13.606 --> 22:16.251
And when Hixton found out about it,
he went to go see Oz,

22:16.252 --> 22:18.313
told the man, "stay away from my daughter."

22:18.314 --> 22:21.024
When Oz didn't, he called us.

22:22.657 --> 22:25.095
You don't believe me, look in my wallet.

22:25.096 --> 22:26.435
Looks like Nicole lied to me

22:26.436 --> 22:28.110
when she told me she didn't recognize him.

22:28.111 --> 22:30.370
It's the guy Hixton had under surveillance.

22:31.694 --> 22:32.823
Is this Oz?

22:32.824 --> 22:36.684
Yep. When Hixton called us,
we drove right up here.

22:36.685 --> 22:39.144
Jumped Oz outside this club downtown.

22:40.728 --> 22:42.537
Yo, Ty hit his bodyguard with a pipe.

22:42.538 --> 22:45.315
I stuffed Oz in the trunk,
drove under the bridge,

22:45.316 --> 22:46.478
and beat on his ass.

22:46.479 --> 22:49.378
Then we came straight here,
been bouncin' tunes ever since.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.088
Is that true?
Did they come here last night?

22:52.089 --> 22:55.257
Yeah, we told the man,
"Best stay away from Nicole

22:55.258 --> 22:56.748
or we gon' put your ass in the river."

22:57.388 --> 22:59.390
He told us we should do it,
cause if we let him live

22:59.391 --> 23:01.175
he was gonna burn us alive.

23:01.176 --> 23:04.836
You wanna know who killed Hixton?
Gotta be Oz.

23:04.837 --> 23:07.862
So Hixton gets a gun
to protect himself from Oz.

23:08.552 --> 23:10.101
He can't go to the cops

23:10.102 --> 23:12.197
'cause that'll get his daughter in trouble.

23:13.627 --> 23:15.852
What the hell was that?
Ryan, watch them.

23:16.384 --> 23:17.785
Stay right where you are.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.953
Well, looks like Oz wasn't kidding

23:24.954 --> 23:26.562
when he said he'd burn 'em alive.

23:29.973 --> 23:32.619
Is it true, Nicole?
Did you start using again?

23:33.340 --> 23:35.950
After I got clean, Oz found me.

23:35.951 --> 23:38.012
He said he wanted me back.

23:38.408 --> 23:40.717
Nicole.
I'm sorry, mom.

23:40.718 --> 23:42.696
I'm so sorry.

23:42.697 --> 23:45.464
And your father knew?
He blamed himself.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.747
He said that he was gonna fix it all,

23:47.748 --> 23:49.176
but I never thought...

23:49.177 --> 23:53.738
This Oz... You think he's capable
of killing your dad?

23:55.555 --> 24:00.474
This is all my fault.
Dad is dead because of me.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.560
It's okay.

24:04.924 --> 24:07.614
Oz... A.K.A. Marvin Osminkowski.

24:07.615 --> 24:09.108
No wonder he changed his name.

24:09.109 --> 24:10.774
According to Vice, he has a lucrative gig

24:10.775 --> 24:13.210
peddling high-end product
to the city's rich and famous,

24:13.211 --> 24:15.286
and a car bomb is definitely his M.O.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.801
A competing dealer
got blown up last year,

24:16.802 --> 24:18.476
but they didn't have enough evidence
to convict.

24:18.477 --> 24:21.213
So Oz shoots Hixton
for ordering the beatdown,

24:21.214 --> 24:23.436
and then attempts to barbecue
the Page brothers

24:23.437 --> 24:25.934
to complete his revenge.
All right. Let's go pick up Oz.

24:25.935 --> 24:27.642
Yeah, well, that's gonna be difficult.

24:27.643 --> 24:30.361
According to Vice,
Oz pretty much operates off grid.

24:30.362 --> 24:31.980
The only time he's on
is when he's dealing

24:31.981 --> 24:34.413
out of word-of-mouth nightclubs,
and even there, he's got

24:34.414 --> 24:37.014
a network of bouncers, waiters,
and patrons as lookouts.

24:37.015 --> 24:38.764
Oz catches one whiff of bacon,

24:38.765 --> 24:40.107
and he vanishes into thin air.

24:40.108 --> 24:42.944
There's gotta be some way
to slip under the radar.

24:45.299 --> 24:46.483
What?

24:46.484 --> 24:48.684
I think we're gonna need your Ferrari.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.177
Mother.

24:54.178 --> 24:58.541
Oh, my. Look at you.
Oh, you look gorgeous.

24:58.542 --> 25:00.504
I'm just gonna grab my keys and change.

25:02.269 --> 25:03.565
You two going out on a date?

25:03.566 --> 25:04.951
Oh, no.

25:04.952 --> 25:06.954
We're just doing a little undercover work.

25:06.955 --> 25:08.447
So how are you doing?

25:09.591 --> 25:10.840
I've been better.

25:10.841 --> 25:13.342
Castle told me that you decided
to give the money back.

25:13.343 --> 25:16.723
Yeah, well, I tried.
Chet's kids refused to take it.

25:16.724 --> 25:19.291
They said, their father loved me,

25:19.292 --> 25:20.934
he wanted me to have the money.

25:20.935 --> 25:22.748
So I'm...

25:22.749 --> 25:25.525
You know, trying to figure out
what to do with it.

25:26.973 --> 25:29.242
Everything I come up with seems so...

25:29.593 --> 25:31.797
Selfish and petty.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.808
Oh, well, it doesn't have to be that way.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.002
You know, someone once told me that

25:37.003 --> 25:38.138
money doesn't change you,

25:38.139 --> 25:40.932
it just magnifies who you are.

25:41.728 --> 25:43.303
You cared about Chet.

25:43.304 --> 25:44.526
Maybe you could do something

25:44.527 --> 25:46.938
that would honor his memory somehow.

25:48.488 --> 25:51.283
That is a lovely thought.

25:51.532 --> 25:54.533
Thank you. Really, thank you.

25:54.534 --> 25:56.600
All right. Got the keys.

25:56.601 --> 25:59.492
Oh, great.
I'm driving.

25:59.921 --> 26:01.081
You're driving?

26:01.082 --> 26:04.299
Beckett, this is... this is a Ferrari.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.554
It is a high-performance vehicle,

26:06.555 --> 26:09.189
designed to respond instantaneously

26:09.190 --> 26:11.253
to your every whim,
your every movement, every...

26:26.618 --> 26:27.671
Nice car.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.790
Get us some drinks and
keep your eyes peeled for Oz, okay?

26:56.192 --> 26:57.488
Okay.

27:07.498 --> 27:09.908
Drinks. Got it.

27:32.229 --> 27:35.220
Ah, come on. Please.
You gotta let me go in and see him.

27:48.129 --> 27:49.135
Hey.

27:49.136 --> 27:52.454
Hey yourself.
I haven't seen you around here before.

27:52.455 --> 27:54.563
Oh, that's because I just came into town.

27:54.564 --> 27:55.466
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.991
From where?
Ibiza.

27:57.992 --> 28:01.529
Mm. So a little birdie
told me all about you.

28:01.530 --> 28:04.136
- Yeah? - Yeah. Said that you know
how to keep a party going

28:04.137 --> 28:05.477
all night long.

28:06.132 --> 28:07.777
Little birdie got a name?

28:07.778 --> 28:09.660
Of course.

28:10.393 --> 28:12.736
Are you gonna tell me what it is?
No.

28:16.001 --> 28:17.364
Yeah, I'm coming.

28:17.365 --> 28:18.745
That your boyfriend?

28:21.753 --> 28:22.813
For now.

28:24.905 --> 28:26.764
I like you.

28:26.765 --> 28:28.144
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:28.145 --> 28:29.671
Well, prove it.

28:30.475 --> 28:32.174
What kind of party you lookin' to get into?

28:32.175 --> 28:36.634
Um... I like to feel shiny.

28:36.635 --> 28:38.767
Shiny, huh?
Yeah.

28:38.768 --> 28:41.125
I think I got something to fit that bill.

28:41.829 --> 28:42.982
But it's gonna cost you.

28:42.983 --> 28:45.381
That's okay. Good things always do.

28:51.685 --> 28:52.734
Aah!

28:53.564 --> 28:54.295
Hey!

28:54.296 --> 28:55.624
Ooh.

29:00.570 --> 29:02.536
No. Handcuffs.

29:02.537 --> 29:03.549
Right.

29:09.507 --> 29:12.096
You sure took a big step down
in the wardrobe department.

29:12.097 --> 29:14.438
You're about to take and
even bigger step down...

29:14.439 --> 29:16.060
Into a prison jumpsuit.

29:16.061 --> 29:17.226
We got you dead to rights

29:17.227 --> 29:18.799
on possession with the intent to sell.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.646
That's 20 years federal time.

29:20.647 --> 29:22.036
But that's nothing compared to

29:22.037 --> 29:24.081
the time that you're gonna do
for first-degree murder.

29:24.082 --> 29:26.303
Not to mention felony blowing crap up.

29:26.304 --> 29:27.741
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:27.742 --> 29:29.080
You remember this guy?

29:30.660 --> 29:32.541
You should. You killed him.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.805
And these two you tried
to kill with a car bomb.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.423
Look... I had to get
those country boys back.

29:40.424 --> 29:43.636
But I didn't have anything
to do with Hixton. I swear.

29:43.637 --> 29:45.342
Here's a thing, Marvin...

29:45.343 --> 29:47.488
We showed your picture
around Hixton's place.

29:47.489 --> 29:49.872
Oddly enough, people saw you there

29:49.873 --> 29:52.097
right about the time he was killed.

29:52.098 --> 29:54.104
Page brothers gave you a serious beating,

29:54.105 --> 29:56.637
you vowed revenge,
and then Hixton shows up dead

29:56.638 --> 29:59.502
with witnesses claiming
to see you at the crime scene?

29:59.503 --> 30:01.005
That doesn't look good for you, Marvin,

30:01.006 --> 30:03.037
and lying to us will only make it worse.

30:03.677 --> 30:04.987
Okay.

30:05.851 --> 30:08.560
Maybe... I had hard feelings
about my medical condition,

30:08.561 --> 30:12.192
and maybe I paid Hixton a visit
to discuss them.

30:12.193 --> 30:14.884
But I abandoned ship
before I got to his door.

30:14.885 --> 30:16.972
You were hot to straighten Hixton out,

30:16.973 --> 30:17.847
and you changed your mind?

30:17.848 --> 30:19.851
Do you really expect us to believe that?

30:19.852 --> 30:21.151
It's the truth.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.545
I took the elevator up to Hixton's place,

30:23.546 --> 30:24.628
when the doors opened,

30:24.629 --> 30:26.286
there was a guy standing right there.

30:26.287 --> 30:27.744
He got a good look at me.

30:27.745 --> 30:29.381
If I would've gone though with my visit,

30:29.382 --> 30:31.196
he woulda pointed me out in a lineup, easy.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.557
So I walked away.

30:32.558 --> 30:34.083
You get a good look at this guy?

30:34.084 --> 30:36.996
Yeah. Rode back down
to the first floor with him.

30:36.997 --> 30:38.301
He was maybe 50,

30:38.302 --> 30:42.064
proper looking,
wearing an old-school tuxedo.

30:43.087 --> 30:44.955
The butler really did do it.

30:46.465 --> 30:48.828
Easley the butler...

30:48.829 --> 30:50.383
Loyal, devoted,

30:50.384 --> 30:52.687
seemingly distraught
over the death of his master.

30:52.688 --> 30:54.985
Yet all the while, lurking behind that mask

30:54.986 --> 30:56.895
of servile correctness...

30:57.533 --> 31:00.325
Was a killer.
Or Oz is just trying to kick up some dust.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.790
I mean, what's the butler's motive?

31:01.791 --> 31:03.374
Well, in fiction, it would be
one of two things.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.318
Firstly, he was carrying on a torrid affair

31:05.319 --> 31:07.412
with his master's wife.
No. Ew.

31:07.413 --> 31:09.775
Second, had to be the money.

31:09.776 --> 31:11.545
I think Castle might be on to something.

31:11.546 --> 31:13.899
I dug a little deeper into Reginald Easley,

31:13.900 --> 31:16.488
and his last few employers
all say the same thing...

31:16.489 --> 31:20.344
Easley resigned after
some of their valuables went missing.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.540
I realized, I've been thinking
about this all wrong.

31:22.541 --> 31:23.901
You're not a frivolous person,

31:23.902 --> 31:25.089
so you wouldn't do frivolous things

31:25.090 --> 31:26.705
with your lottery winnings.
Castle.

31:26.706 --> 31:28.769
No, no. I'm gonna figure this out.
If you...

31:36.854 --> 31:38.104
Packing your things?

31:38.105 --> 31:39.396
These aren't my things.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.295
They belong to my employer.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.994
Must be hard, being around all this wealth,

31:43.995 --> 31:45.188
none of it yours.

31:45.189 --> 31:47.485
I'm content with my lot.
Really?

31:47.486 --> 31:49.402
We read up on you.

31:49.403 --> 31:52.097
Born in Leeds to a single mother

31:52.098 --> 31:53.576
who was a seamstress.

31:53.577 --> 31:56.250
With the right training,
you lost the lowbrow accent

31:56.251 --> 31:57.912
and learned to fit in with the gentry,

31:57.913 --> 32:00.428
where you saw people spend more in one day

32:00.429 --> 32:02.561
than your mother made in an entire year.

32:02.562 --> 32:04.247
Then along comes Hixton,

32:04.248 --> 32:06.470
a man with an upbringing
not unlike your own.

32:06.471 --> 32:10.465
But he owned all this, and he owned you,

32:10.466 --> 32:13.646
and not because of any special talent
or intelligence.

32:13.647 --> 32:15.728
Just because he guessed six numbers,

32:15.729 --> 32:17.223
and you didn't.

32:17.224 --> 32:19.247
And taking from Hixton
wasn't really stealing.

32:19.248 --> 32:21.294
It was just correcting a karmic injustice.

32:21.295 --> 32:23.001
You made him open that safe,

32:23.002 --> 32:24.888
but what you didn't know
was that he had a gun,

32:24.889 --> 32:27.433
and when he reached for it,
this is where it ended.

32:27.434 --> 32:29.747
What on earth makes you think that?

32:29.748 --> 32:31.044
We know that you were here

32:31.045 --> 32:33.420
the night that he was killed, Mr. Easley,

32:33.421 --> 32:35.614
long after you said that you had left.

32:36.468 --> 32:41.262
Early on, he bought
25 first edition Dickens...

32:42.062 --> 32:45.402
Charles Dickens...
and the man didn't even read.

32:45.403 --> 32:46.582
He just liked the look of the leather

32:46.583 --> 32:48.284
on their spines.
Mr. Easley...

32:48.285 --> 32:49.868
I stole two of them.

32:50.521 --> 32:52.087
To me, it was like levying a tax

32:52.088 --> 32:53.579
on him for being an idiot.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.280
But then I had a change of heart.

32:55.281 --> 32:59.133
I brought them back here that night,
around 11:00,

32:59.134 --> 33:00.574
thinking he was out with his wife.

33:00.575 --> 33:01.918
But for some reason he was here.

33:01.919 --> 33:03.729
I-I heard the shower running.

33:03.730 --> 33:05.599
Your excuse for coming back here

33:05.600 --> 33:06.603
the night that he was killed

33:06.604 --> 33:09.040
was that you had a change of heart?

33:09.041 --> 33:10.872
Yes.

33:10.873 --> 33:13.887
I'd like to say it was because
his turn to philanthropy

33:13.888 --> 33:15.640
made me see him in a different light,

33:15.641 --> 33:17.493
as a good man one shouldn't steal from.

33:18.475 --> 33:19.567
But the truth is, I was scared

33:19.568 --> 33:21.520
his bad luck would become mine.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.024
He won over $100 million in the lottery.

33:24.025 --> 33:26.185
One could hardly consider that bad luck.

33:26.186 --> 33:28.572
Mm. His marriage failed,
his daughter fell into drugs,

33:28.573 --> 33:30.621
and he was just gunned down
in his own apartment.

33:30.622 --> 33:33.101
That, sir, is the universe...
What did you call it?

33:33.102 --> 33:35.448
Oh, yes, "correcting a karmic injustice."

33:35.449 --> 33:36.692
What do you mean?

33:37.621 --> 33:39.199
The winning lottery ticket.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.584
Hixton let it slip one night

33:40.585 --> 33:42.808
after a little too much time
with the bottle.

33:43.347 --> 33:45.385
He always played the same numbers...

33:45.386 --> 33:48.468
The dates he and his wife
met and were married...

33:48.469 --> 33:52.583
01-03-95 and 10-24-98.

33:52.584 --> 33:54.586
None of those numbers are on the ticket.

33:54.587 --> 33:56.766
All the misery that came from the money?

33:56.767 --> 33:59.713
Hixton believed it was because
he stole the ticket.

34:01.681 --> 34:03.002
So you think Hixton was murdered

34:03.003 --> 34:04.363
because he stole the ticket?

34:04.364 --> 34:05.806
No. Yes.

34:05.807 --> 34:08.184
Come on. You... I mean,

34:08.185 --> 34:09.514
it was worth a fortune.

34:09.516 --> 34:12.398
Easley had every reason
to make up that story,

34:12.399 --> 34:14.683
and even if those weren't
Hixton's regular numbers,

34:14.684 --> 34:16.364
it still doesn't prove
that he stole the ticket.

34:16.366 --> 34:19.335
But the theft explains
so much about Hixton's behavior.

34:19.335 --> 34:20.411
The director of the soup kitchen

34:20.413 --> 34:22.389
said that Hixton compulsively
gave away his money,

34:22.391 --> 34:23.545
like he felt he didn't deserve it.

34:23.547 --> 34:25.532
I called it winner's guilt.

34:25.533 --> 34:27.589
But what if it was another kind
of guilt entirely?

34:27.590 --> 34:29.185
Okay, fine. Let's say that you're right.

34:29.186 --> 34:30.784
Let's say that Hixton stole the ticket.

34:30.786 --> 34:32.556
There's still no evidence suggesting the

34:32.556 --> 34:33.870
that contributed to his death.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.415
You're the first person to tell me

34:35.416 --> 34:38.523
that there are no coincidences
in a murder investigation.

34:38.524 --> 34:39.433
Hold on, detective.

34:39.434 --> 34:41.851
He's got a point.
You said Hixton told Meech

34:41.853 --> 34:43.362
his past was coming back to get him.

34:43.362 --> 34:45.178
Now we thought he meant the Page brothers.

34:45.179 --> 34:46.384
But this ticket represents

34:46.385 --> 34:48.268
the biggest thing
that ever happened to him.

34:48.268 --> 34:50.848
I call that a major motive for murder.

34:50.849 --> 34:54.132
Okay, fine. Then if it's true,
how do we prove it?

34:55.427 --> 34:56.929
The numbers.

34:58.098 --> 35:00.513
2, 4, 8...

35:00.514 --> 35:04.081
19, 41, and 79.

35:04.082 --> 35:05.554
I know it's a long shot,

35:05.555 --> 35:06.883
but if we can figure out
what these numbers signify,

35:06.884 --> 35:08.867
we might be able to find
the ticket's real owner.

35:08.868 --> 35:10.263
I play my kids' birthdays.

35:10.264 --> 35:13.670
I play my firsts... sex and combat.

35:13.671 --> 35:15.188
I play his firsts, too.

35:16.749 --> 35:18.251
What?
That way, we both win,

35:18.252 --> 35:19.681
and it's not awkward.

35:20.532 --> 35:22.812
Beckett?
Uh, sorry. I don't play, Castle.

35:22.813 --> 35:25.031
But if you did?
Well, it doesn't really matter, Castle.

35:25.032 --> 35:25.816
I mean, the fact is,

35:25.817 --> 35:27.932
Hixton won the lottery a year ago.

35:27.933 --> 35:28.959
If he stole that ticket,

35:28.960 --> 35:30.971
why didn't the rightful owner
come forward sooner?

35:30.972 --> 35:33.045
Maybe the rightful owner is dead.

35:33.046 --> 35:35.442
Maybe Hixton killed him.

35:36.171 --> 35:38.742
The moon.
The weird purchases Hixton made.

35:38.743 --> 35:40.258
As soon as he won,
he bought 3 acres on the moon

35:40.259 --> 35:42.857
and a mausoleum for his neighbor.

35:44.757 --> 35:47.573
- Find out everything we can
on this neighbor. - I'm on it.

35:47.574 --> 35:50.357
If you're right, Castle,
I'm betting Hixton's neighbor

35:50.358 --> 35:52.391
never imagined
that the luckiest day of his life

35:52.392 --> 35:55.020
would also be his last.
Boo-yah!

35:55.021 --> 35:57.065
Neighbor's name was Hank Walters.

35:57.066 --> 35:59.318
He died the day the winning numbers
were announced.

35:59.319 --> 36:02.854
Walters' birthday... 2/8/41...

36:02.855 --> 36:04.335
Three of the numbers in the lottery ticket.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.258
Two days later,

36:05.259 --> 36:08.296
Hixton came forward
to claim his $117 million check.

36:08.297 --> 36:09.826
What did Walters die of?

36:09.827 --> 36:11.429
Natural causes.
For real?

36:11.430 --> 36:12.780
Yeah. He was an old man dying of,

36:12.781 --> 36:13.959
like, six different things.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.004
Lanie went over the autopsy,

36:15.005 --> 36:15.883
said everything looked like

36:15.884 --> 36:18.746
it was on the up-and-up.
So Walters is bedridden.

36:18.747 --> 36:20.899
Hixton, like any good neighbor,
asks the old man

36:20.900 --> 36:22.307
if there's anything he can do for him.

36:22.308 --> 36:24.191
Walters says,
"Yes, buy me a lottery ticket."

36:24.192 --> 36:25.192
Maybe it was a onetime thing.

36:25.193 --> 36:26.297
Maybe he did it all the time.

36:26.298 --> 36:29.170
This time, the numbers are announced,

36:29.171 --> 36:30.546
and Walters won.

36:30.547 --> 36:33.533
Hixton rushes back to tell him
and finds Walters dead.

36:33.534 --> 36:34.691
And doesn't know what to do.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.611
That's why it took him
an extra day to come forward.

36:36.612 --> 36:38.372
He was struggling
with the moral implications.

36:38.373 --> 36:40.735
Yeah, but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

36:40.736 --> 36:41.973
He claimed the ticket as his own.

36:41.974 --> 36:43.360
Clearly no one else knew about it.

36:43.361 --> 36:45.497
What about family?
Did Walters have any?

36:45.498 --> 36:46.583
Well...

36:46.584 --> 36:49.414
According to county records,
the only living relative

36:49.415 --> 36:52.342
of Hank Walters is a nephew named Tom,

36:52.343 --> 36:55.489
and guess where he lives.
New York City.

36:57.510 --> 36:58.884
I'm sorry.

36:58.885 --> 37:01.501
Are you telling me
that I might inherit $100 million?

37:01.502 --> 37:03.624
Come on, Tom.
You already figured that out.

37:03.625 --> 37:05.812
You confronted Hixton.

37:05.813 --> 37:07.395
You told him you wanted restitution.

37:07.396 --> 37:08.735
He said no. Things got ugly.

37:08.736 --> 37:10.402
And Hixton ended up dead.

37:10.403 --> 37:12.723
So you grabbed what was in the safe
and you took off.

37:12.724 --> 37:14.410
What?
Knock it off, Tom.

37:14.411 --> 37:15.890
You're the old man's only living relative.

37:15.891 --> 37:18.741
You're the only one
with motive for revenge.

37:18.742 --> 37:22.466
No, I'm not his only relative.
He's got a son.

37:22.467 --> 37:23.988
No, he doesn't. We checked.

37:23.989 --> 37:25.764
Well, sure.
He's not biological.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.722
Hank dated his mom for, like, five years

37:27.723 --> 37:28.929
while the kid was growing up.

37:28.930 --> 37:30.338
The two bonded like crazy.

37:30.339 --> 37:32.784
Kept in touch even after
the romance broke up.

37:32.785 --> 37:34.529
They even spent every holiday together

37:34.530 --> 37:36.198
for the last ten years.

37:36.777 --> 37:41.639
This son, is his birthday 4/19/79?

37:41.640 --> 37:44.600
Uh, yeah. How'd you know?

37:44.601 --> 37:46.287
Because those are
the three remaining numbers

37:46.288 --> 37:47.977
in the winning lottery ticket.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.016
You lied to us about who you are, Shawn.

37:51.988 --> 37:53.441
These are your dad's numbers...

37:53.442 --> 37:55.676
Your birthday and his.

37:56.303 --> 37:58.468
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:58.469 --> 38:01.007
When did you realize that Hixton had stolen

38:01.008 --> 38:02.191
the winning ticket?

38:02.192 --> 38:04.336
Was it when you were still
in prison in Memphis?

38:04.337 --> 38:05.831
Or was it after you got out,

38:05.832 --> 38:07.150
went to go and visit your dad,

38:07.151 --> 38:08.525
found out he was dead

38:08.526 --> 38:09.600
and that his mausoleum was paid

38:09.601 --> 38:11.022
for with his stolen winnings?

38:11.023 --> 38:12.852
I can't imagine how you must have felt,

38:12.853 --> 38:14.811
how driven you were to come to New York,

38:14.812 --> 38:16.615
make things right.

38:16.616 --> 38:19.647
You tracked down Hixton
at the soup kitchen,

38:19.648 --> 38:21.766
threatened him with all kinds of things

38:21.767 --> 38:22.978
if he didn't do right by you.

38:22.979 --> 38:24.374
He freaked out. He gave you his car.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.758
But that wasn't enough, was it?

38:29.137 --> 38:31.427
You can't prove any of this.

38:33.206 --> 38:36.315
I can prove all of it, Shawn.

38:37.939 --> 38:39.541
We found the money from Hixton's safe

38:39.542 --> 38:40.248
in your apartment

38:40.249 --> 38:42.368
with trace amounts of his blood in it.

38:42.848 --> 38:44.349
So what happened next?

38:45.811 --> 38:48.891
I mean, why would you walk away
with only 100 grand?

38:49.527 --> 38:52.179
He owed you millions.

38:53.785 --> 38:55.536
Hmm.

38:57.354 --> 39:02.312
I went to his apartment
to collect what was mine.

39:03.503 --> 39:05.030
He told me...

39:05.700 --> 39:08.171
I didn't deserve the money.

39:08.518 --> 39:11.135
He said that I was a dirtbag criminal,

39:11.136 --> 39:13.797
and all I was gonna do if he gave it to me

39:13.798 --> 39:15.826
was put it up my nose.

39:15.827 --> 39:18.821
Instead, he was gonna give it all away...

39:19.933 --> 39:21.856
To those in need.

39:24.834 --> 39:28.302
I told him, I was in need.

39:29.597 --> 39:32.098
Then he grabbed for my gun.

39:33.513 --> 39:35.368
It went off.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.348
So what's gonna happen with all that money?

39:40.349 --> 39:42.530
Well, that's for the lawyers to decide.

39:42.531 --> 39:44.936
The good thing is that Nicole
is going back into rehab,

39:44.937 --> 39:46.291
and her mom's gonna be there for her

39:46.292 --> 39:47.152
when she gets out.

39:47.153 --> 39:49.540
- Well, at least something good
will come of all this. - Mm-hmm.

39:49.541 --> 39:52.560
That is it for me. I am beat.
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:52.561 --> 39:53.741
Wait. You giving up?

39:54.529 --> 39:57.347
No more questions about
my innermost jackpot dreams?

39:57.348 --> 39:58.899
You said you didn't have any.

39:58.900 --> 40:00.938
Good night, Castle.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.453
Good night.

40:08.422 --> 40:09.888
Good evening, ladies.

40:09.889 --> 40:11.366
Hi.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.410
Are you buying property?

40:13.411 --> 40:15.818
Gram decided what to do
with her inheritance.

40:15.819 --> 40:18.155
I think it's perfect.
Really, what?

40:18.156 --> 40:19.319
I'm going to open

40:19.320 --> 40:22.378
the Martha Rodgers School of Acting.

40:22.379 --> 40:25.125
Oh. I-I thought

40:25.126 --> 40:26.525
you were gonna do something to honor Chet?

40:26.526 --> 40:27.875
Well, I am.
Oh, no.

40:27.876 --> 40:29.365
Chet was always encouraging me

40:29.366 --> 40:32.140
to use my enormous talent to help people.

40:32.141 --> 40:32.829
Then wouldn't you call it

40:32.830 --> 40:34.332
the Chet Palaburn School of Acting

40:34.333 --> 40:35.403
given its auspices?

40:35.404 --> 40:37.603
Well, it's customary that

40:37.604 --> 40:38.583
when you're opening a school,

40:38.584 --> 40:41.674
you use a great teacher's name,
like, um, Strasberg,

40:41.675 --> 40:44.318
Meisner, Adler, and now Rodgers.

40:44.319 --> 40:47.674
Oh, I am, however, going to commission

40:47.675 --> 40:50.469
a portrait to be done of Chet
that will hang in the lobby

40:50.470 --> 40:53.216
so his legacy will last forever.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.965
Nice.
Mm.

40:56.068 --> 40:57.153
Legacy.

40:57.154 --> 40:58.232
What?
Hmm?

40:59.944 --> 41:01.836
I know what Beckett would do.

41:14.303 --> 41:15.053
Castle.

41:15.054 --> 41:17.344
I know what you would do
if you won the lottery.

41:19.673 --> 41:22.081
By all means, please come in.

41:25.311 --> 41:27.150
So what is your big insight

41:27.151 --> 41:29.657
into a financial decision
that I will never have to make?

41:30.353 --> 41:32.278
You would use the money

41:32.279 --> 41:34.776
to honor your mother's legacy.

41:34.777 --> 41:35.737
On the way over here,

41:35.738 --> 41:37.605
I called the dean
of your mom's old law school.

41:37.606 --> 41:39.086
We talked about starting a scholarship

41:39.087 --> 41:40.765
in Johanna Beckett's name.

41:40.766 --> 41:43.003
One that would provide
a full ride for a student

41:43.004 --> 41:44.470
planning on dedicating their career

41:44.471 --> 41:47.372
to those in the legal system
without a voice.

41:47.373 --> 41:49.566
The kind of people your mom championed.

41:49.567 --> 41:51.754
And with your blessing,

41:51.755 --> 41:54.245
I would like to host
a fund-raiser to fund it.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.214
You just can't stay
out of my personal life, can you?

42:03.584 --> 42:06.259
Thank you. That's really sweet.

42:07.910 --> 42:09.761
We definitely have to invite the mayor

42:09.762 --> 42:11.181
and all of his campaign contributors.

42:11.182 --> 42:13.495
Some of 'em can be boorish.
They got this one guy...

42:13.496 --> 42:16.436
Bill Rowe. He's so rich, he has...
