WEBVTT

00:40.665 --> 00:42.375
-[bell rings]
-[Steve] All right, guys.

00:42.459 --> 00:45.295
Today we're focusing on sexual education,

00:45.378 --> 00:47.964
which I am now qualified to teach

00:49.424 --> 00:51.718
because I recently made thick in the warm.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.179
-Any questions?
-Nick Birch, row three.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.222
When you say thick in the warm,

00:56.306 --> 00:58.641
-what do you mean by that?
-I had the same question.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.978
I'm talking about
emptying my guts into a lady.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.646
Who could be anyone's mom.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.814
Oh, I see.

01:04.898 --> 01:09.402
So the lady is the warm,
and then Coach Steve, he makes the thick?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.612
-Oof!
-Argh!

01:10.695 --> 01:12.405
I hope you at least wore a condom.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.617
A yogurt balloon? No.
Those things taste terrible.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.494
Aren't you worried about getting
the woman pregnant?

01:17.577 --> 01:18.953
Or like getting an STD?

01:19.037 --> 01:22.123
I didn't even think of that.
I was so busy gooping.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.793
Maybe you should go to a doctor
or a Planned Parenthood.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.252
What's Planned Parenthood?

01:26.336 --> 01:27.837
It's an abortion factory.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.839
Jay, you don't know
what you're talking about.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.800
You've never even been
to a Planned Parenthood.

01:31.883 --> 01:35.011
Oh, for your information,
I've been in the car and number of times

01:35.095 --> 01:37.055
when my dad has dropped off
his receptionist there,

01:37.138 --> 01:38.765
and he calls it an abortion factory.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.266
Yeah, we seen his law commercials.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.103
Don't forget his Twitter feed.
Pretty outspoken on Twitter.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.647
I'm sorry,
but they do a lot more than abortions.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.023
Yeah, they save lives.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.942
-By killing babies?
-Jay, please stop.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.401
Watch YouTube, guys.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.153
Just watch YouTube.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.447
Gentlemen, I think Jessi is referring
to cancer screenings.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.157
I don't understand.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.409
Is there some sort of skit
that we can watch

01:58.493 --> 02:02.122
that'd be entertaining and informative,
but also not too preachy?

02:02.205 --> 02:03.832
Ooh! That is a fine line
we're trying to walk.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.334
-Well, we're gonna do our best.
-All right.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.920
[female voice]
The year is 2126.

02:09.003 --> 02:12.048
The evil Lord Bilzerian has declared
women's healthcare "gay"

02:12.132 --> 02:14.467
and outlawed all Planned Parenthoods.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.720
Luckily, an elite medical team
travels the galaxy,

02:17.804 --> 02:19.430
helping women in need,

02:19.514 --> 02:23.184
led by Captain Missy Foreman-Greenwald.
They are...

02:23.268 --> 02:25.270
The Vagilantes!

02:28.815 --> 02:31.067
Captain, we're getting
an urgent transmission.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.945
A female on Texania is due
for a pap smear.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.446
Chewbacca sound!

02:35.530 --> 02:37.490
Affirmative. Initiate hyper speed.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.951
[swooshes]

02:40.034 --> 02:43.079
Texania. That's Bilzerian territory.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.206
Don't worry, Missy. I'll protect you.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.958
Well, I'll protect her too.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.044
General Fillion and Janitor Glouberman,
though I'm flattered,

02:50.128 --> 02:52.130
I'm fully capable of protecting myself.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.548
Excuse me, am I a janitor?

02:53.631 --> 02:55.925
Every person on this team
is equally important.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.720
Even the person who through our feces
out of the window by hand.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.389
What? Why do I have to do it that way?

03:01.514 --> 03:03.808
Fuck you, Glouberman,
and go wash your hands.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.727
No matter how much you wash your hands,

03:05.810 --> 03:07.770
a trace amount of feces
will always remain.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.688
[grunts]

03:10.106 --> 03:12.567
Captain, our sensors have detected
a Bilzerian patrol in the area.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.445
The patient is ready.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.864
Brace yourself, people!
Initiating shrink down.

03:17.947 --> 03:21.117
I wish there was a way to shrink
my burning desire to be with you, Missy.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.328
Well, I wish we could shrink the feces.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.455
I mean we obviously have the technology.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.874
[Missy]
Prepare for pelvic exam!

03:29.417 --> 03:32.837
[Fillion] You know,Â I'll never get used to
this part of the job.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.299
Extending the swab, captain.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.136
Okay, now scan the sample
for abnormal cells.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.263
Captain, another ship
has entered the vagina.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.141
What sort of space ship
would enter a vagina without consent?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.560
-The Bilzerians.
-Yeah, the Bilzerians.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.937
I was totally gonna say that.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.438
You heard me say it first though.
Right, Missy?

03:50.521 --> 03:51.731
Oh, boys. Please.

03:54.359 --> 03:58.947
Attention! Your ship is in violation
of Bilzerian Space Law 69,

03:59.030 --> 04:01.491
but only on the guy.
Surrender immediately.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.743
Not on my watch, friend.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.122
We'll lose them in the fallopian tubes.
I guarantee it.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.374
It's gonna be a tight squeeze.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.126
[Fillion] Oh Missy,
if anyone can do it, you can.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.670
[Andrew] Kiss butt much, Fillion?

04:13.753 --> 04:15.004
[Fillion] Well, I'd rather kiss butt

04:15.088 --> 04:17.590
than take what comes out of a butt by hand
and fling it out the window.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.926
You know, you're 50 years old.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.929
Missy, I need you to know
I am only in my mid-forties.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.932
[Missy] Oh, sweet mother Gaia.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.269
Look at all of these beautiful ova.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.105
When the average woman is born,
she has 300,000 eggs.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.023
Gracious me! Do you see what I see?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.608
An ovarian cyst!

04:35.817 --> 04:38.319
Oh, fuck. I mean, Chewbacca sound!

04:38.403 --> 04:40.154
We have to remove in case it ruptures.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.364
I'm going out there.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.157
No, Missy. It's too dangerous.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.577
-For once, I agree with Mr. Shit.
-Do you see how mean he is to me?

04:46.661 --> 04:47.912
Guys, I have to do it.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.331
This woman's reproductive health
might be at stake.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.459
Approaching cyst.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.795
It looks cyst-y.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.007
[Fillion]
Missy, we've got a problem.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.010
[Andrew]
Is it that you're 46 and she's 13?

05:02.093 --> 05:03.344
Stop right there.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.013
We've got you surrounded.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.765
Any last requests, science lesbo?

05:07.849 --> 05:10.059
Actually, yes. Just one.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.604
I ask you to look around

05:13.688 --> 05:16.941
at the majesty
of the female reproductive system,

05:17.025 --> 05:19.152
because it is this very system

05:19.235 --> 05:22.530
that brings each and every one of us
into the world.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.282
Even you, Bilzerians.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.533
You are of us.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.285
You know, she's right.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.538
The female reproductive system
is how you make...

05:31.122 --> 05:32.915
-boys.
-Go now, Missy,

05:32.999 --> 05:36.669
and I will see to it that we protect
these beautiful factories

05:36.753 --> 05:38.046
for male excellence.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.381
-Come on, boys!
-Dudes!

05:40.465 --> 05:44.427
Okay, not exactly the point I was making,
but I'll take it!

05:44.510 --> 05:45.803
Vagina wipe!

05:46.220 --> 05:49.474
Missy, we've analyzed the cells,
and our patient is gonna be okay.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.726
What an exciting adventure this has been.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.145
Yes, it really makes you think
about what's important.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.939
Andrew, I'm sorry
that you're a shit flinger.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.609
And I'm sorry
that all your shows got canceled.

05:59.692 --> 06:00.568
[laughing]

06:00.651 --> 06:03.321
Touche. Perhaps we're more alike
than we care to admit.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.074
Andrew, would you be willing
to dance the merengue with me

06:06.157 --> 06:08.868
while we both make
searing eye contact with Missy?

06:08.993 --> 06:11.621
Si, Senor. A thousand times si.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.874
Chewbacca sound!

06:14.957 --> 06:16.125
Wo wo wo!

06:16.209 --> 06:18.294
You said it, baby. Vroom!

06:18.378 --> 06:19.337
Argh!

06:19.420 --> 06:20.546
Okay, fine.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.883
Maybe Planned Parenthood does
a couple cancer screenings.

06:23.966 --> 06:27.053
-But it's mostly abortions.
-Common misconception, Jay.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.847
Abortions make up
only a tiny percentage of what they do.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.557
Yeah, they also do breast exams.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.976
Which I've already offered to do for free

06:34.060 --> 06:35.561
for all the girls in the class.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.398
In fact, I'll pay you in Bitcoin.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.941
Kid's a financial genius.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.860
Why aren't you offering girls money
to touch their tits?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.654
Because it's prostitution.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.365
Not if you do it so good,
she falls in love with you.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.658
You know that's possible, right?

06:48.741 --> 06:50.910
Also, Planned Parenthood
offers birth control

06:50.993 --> 06:53.204
to literally millions of people.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.664
-[Steve] Bird control?
-What?

06:54.747 --> 06:55.623
Good luck.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.376
Everybody says
that pigeons are the rats of the sky,

06:58.459 --> 06:59.836
but let me tell you something,

06:59.919 --> 07:03.423
they're the Einsteins
of the diaper barge where I live.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.217
I think the person who had sex with you
may have committed a crime.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.512
-[softly] Yeah.
-Steve, we're talking about contraception.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.850
Again, if you had some sort of skit
that referenced a TV show,

07:13.933 --> 07:16.519
I might have a shot
at understanding.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.271
Okay, you broken Roomba.

07:18.354 --> 07:22.024
I wish I had wheels,
running into walls and what-not.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.778
Babies... they're like tuna melts.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.531
They sound good,
but do you really want one right now?

07:29.115 --> 07:30.867
I don't want a baby or a tuna melt.

07:31.909 --> 07:32.785
The tuna's all hot,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.413
and a baby's,
like, a lot of responsibility.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.166
That's why tonight,
we're going to help Leah find...

07:38.833 --> 07:40.751
the perfect contraception.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.589
Leah, let's meet your choices, girl.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.048
I'm so excited.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.759
Okay, easy, Anne Hathaway.
[laughs] Calm down.

07:52.138 --> 07:52.972
Hi, Leah.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.225
-What's up?
-Oh, wow!

07:56.309 --> 07:57.185
Nice to meet you.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.895
Did we just hug?
I couldn't feel anything.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.188
Yeah, we definitely hugged.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.773
Just kidding. I felt it a tiny bit.
It was okay.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.318
Hi Leah, I'm the pill.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.529
Let's get right to it.
I need to know that you're serious.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.447
I think I am.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.700
No, you have to make
a commitment to me every day.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.244
-What if I forget?
Then every day for the rest of your life,

08:15.328 --> 08:17.121
-you're going to have a tuna melt.
-Ugh!

08:18.915 --> 08:21.626
Hey, girl, I'm surgically implanted
in your arm for up to three years.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.712
With me, you just set it and forget it,
and let the dude just slam it home.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.173
Slam it home?
Is that what sex is like?

08:27.256 --> 08:28.758
Through college at least.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.176
[coughing]

08:31.802 --> 08:34.180
We both know you're not going to pick me.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.766
-I'm just here for the buffet.
-Okay.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.519
Your mother and I were
really good friends.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.854
I'm an IUD.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.733
I'm incredibly effective,
but it's going to hurt going in.

08:45.816 --> 08:50.112
-But perhaps you like a little pain.
-Your lips are freezing.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.200
Hey, what's up?

08:54.325 --> 08:56.202
-I'm the Pull Out Method.
-Hi.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.871
Oh, whoa! Were we about to kiss, babe?

08:58.955 --> 09:01.040
Um, excuse me, his hand is on my boob.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.709
Hey, get off of her!
Go to the mansion and get some wine.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.753
Don't threaten me with a good time.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.550
The cocktail party was a really great way
to get to know my options a little better

09:10.633 --> 09:12.009
while eating coconut shrimp.

09:13.094 --> 09:17.014
Honey, can you get me a doggy bag
for the mango salsa?

09:17.098 --> 09:20.476
Seven of them are sugar pills,
but I would take them just to keep track.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.686
Sounds complicated.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.771
Wait, so do I get my period
during those days?

09:23.854 --> 09:25.523
Yeah, it's kind of a bummer, but--

09:25.606 --> 09:27.608
I'm sorry, can I just steal you for a sec?

09:27.692 --> 09:28.818
Oh. Let me just...

09:28.901 --> 09:29.986
I hate talking shit,

09:30.069 --> 09:33.322
but none of these other choices
prevent STDs.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.741
-Oh!
-Babe, babe, baby...

09:35.825 --> 09:38.786
I just want to be close to you
with nothing in between us.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.830
-Is that so wrong?
-I guess not?

09:40.913 --> 09:45.751
Also, with these other methods,
you don't get that sweet belly blam.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.752
Oh!

09:51.924 --> 09:53.676
Well, Leah, it's time.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.763
This is the hardest choice
I have ever had to make.

09:57.847 --> 10:02.310
You are all so special,
but I have to go with my heart and pick...

10:02.393 --> 10:04.437
[clock ticking]

10:16.532 --> 10:17.825
The Pull Out Method!

10:17.908 --> 10:18.826
Yes!

10:18.951 --> 10:21.078
I cannot wait to come inside you.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.622
-[The Implant] Oh, man.
-Don't trust him.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.040
[kissing, moaning]

10:24.123 --> 10:24.999
Oh yeah.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.375
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.711
Another teenager
making a terrible life choice.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.005
Cut! Nope. Turn the lights on.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.507
You are not picking the Pull Out Method.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.967
Mom, we love each other!

10:35.051 --> 10:37.219
-Whoa! Your mom is hot.
-I know this guy.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.263
He gave me chlamydia.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.015
You are beautiful.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.892
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.061
You're going on the pill,
and you're using condoms.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.312
-Yes.
-Come to me, baby.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.230
-And that is final.
-Double up.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.066
Diane, is that you?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.735
I haven't seen you since senior prom.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.696
-Yeah.
-Michael Villareal? Hello.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.948
-He was a catch.
-How are you doing?

10:58.032 --> 11:00.451
-I'm dying, Diane.
-Oh, uh...

11:00.534 --> 11:01.702
Bone cancer.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.287
Sorry to hear that. Leah, let's go.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.705
It spread to my feet.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.499
Honestly, it's just at this point...

11:07.500 --> 11:09.710
and it's hard enough
to be open in today's world,

11:09.794 --> 11:11.671
and I offered to be fully implanted,

11:11.754 --> 11:14.465
and I think that is a rare find
to just meet at contraceptive,

11:14.548 --> 11:15.966
that's like, "I will implant today

11:16.050 --> 11:18.803
and I can guarantee you that
I'll be there for you for three years,"

11:18.886 --> 11:20.137
but obviously if that's not enough,

11:20.221 --> 11:22.223
maybe she's not the person
that I should be protecting.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.975
Like maybe I should be protecting myself,
'cause obviously I'm hurt now.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.770
Like maybe I should just put
a fucking condom over my own self.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.942
Well, in the end,
I think she made a wise choice.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.320
Coming up next,
the finale of Spatula in Paradise.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.948
You're both such amazing spatulas,

11:39.031 --> 11:41.867
so this is one of the hardest decisions
I've ever had to make,

11:41.951 --> 11:43.327
but I'm going to choose...

11:44.787 --> 11:46.664
-the metal one.
-They're both metal.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.624
The one I did pancakes with.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.378
Wow! I never realized women had to make
so many birth control choices.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.505
Well, men need
to take responsibility too, though.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.965
Beautifully said, Jessi.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.800
Dad, what are you doing here?

11:57.883 --> 12:00.136
Nickie, I knew
you would've been so embarrassed

12:00.219 --> 12:02.596
If I didn't come and tell
your entire sex ed class

12:02.680 --> 12:05.182
-about my decision to get a vasectomy.
-A vasectomy?

12:05.266 --> 12:08.352
Your mother and I are making
a commitment to pleasure.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.229
-What does that mean?
-Please don't ask him that.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.731
Okay everybody, from now on,

12:11.814 --> 12:14.066
my erotic ministrations
with Nickie's mother

12:14.150 --> 12:17.403
will be purely an expression
of lust and gratitude.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.113
-We're done here.
-No more babies.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.407
-Just knee buckling orgasms.
-Dad...

12:21.490 --> 12:23.617
To say I'm eager to please
is an understatement.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.954
Wow, Dr. Birch. You're a real partner
in family planning with your wife.

12:27.037 --> 12:30.624
Well, Mrs. Birch's birth control
was robbing her of her natural moisture.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.752
Ooh! What, are we talking about,
your mom's N.M.?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.170
-Jay...
-Natural Moisture.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.173
Dad, get out of here
and just go get your vasectomy already.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.340
-Okay?
-You got it, Nickie,

12:38.424 --> 12:40.050
but you're coming on the journey...

12:40.134 --> 12:41.635
-[softly] ...with me.
-Oh dear Lord.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.765
[Elliot] It all started in Brooklyn,
my hometown.

12:45.848 --> 12:50.019
Land of the Dodgers, Coney Island,
and Nathan's Famous dogs.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.812
These were dogs
that had their own headshots.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.107
The year was 1955.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.567
Hold on. 1955?

12:56.650 --> 12:58.360
No. You weren't even born yet, dad.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.362
Not to mention, Nathan sells hot dogs.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.490
They were hot, Nickie. Red hot.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.326
-The biggest stars in the country.
-So the dogs were movie stars.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.535
It's my vasectomy.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.454
I'll tell the story how I want.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.039
The first year of my residency,

13:10.122 --> 13:12.750
I was working nights
at a 1950s themed diner,

13:12.833 --> 13:14.168
which back then was just a diner,

13:14.251 --> 13:18.547
when in walked the most beautiful girl
I'd ever seen: Your mother.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.550
-Hi, I'm Diane Keaton.
-[Nick] That's not mom's maiden name.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.761
I'm an independent woman
who's sexually liberated.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.012
That's why I'm wearing pants.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.306
[Elliot] She was a woman
who knew what she wanted.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.767
Pants, and also your old man,

13:29.850 --> 13:33.020
who was a young man then in 1955.

13:33.103 --> 13:36.440
I was smitten, Nickie.
And one night, your mother called me over

13:36.524 --> 13:38.025
because a lobster was attacking her.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.611
I came as soon
as my analyst told me you called.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.112
[Nick] I'm sorry,
is that a Woody Allen thing?

13:42.196 --> 13:45.115
I've never seen any of his movies,
'cause mom says he's a monster.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.700
[Elliot] And I saved your mother

13:46.784 --> 13:49.703
-by giving the lobster a tennis racket.
-[Nick] Okay, I'm gonna stop you.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.580
I thought this was the story
of your vasectomy.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.541
It's about our family. Anyway...

13:53.624 --> 13:57.002
Elliot, we've done oral to each other
a number of times,

13:57.086 --> 13:58.838
but now I want to have sex with you.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.381
You mean, make love.

14:00.464 --> 14:01.674
Argh! Sure.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.802
[Nick] So what is this,
the night that you guys conceived Judd?

14:04.885 --> 14:07.388
[Elliot] Not that night, Nickie,
because it was during the day.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.640
Your mother rolled a condom on slowly.

14:09.723 --> 14:14.562
My penis was as hard as it is for me
to watch you kids grow up so fast.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.814
[Nick] Dad, this is unforgivable.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.066
[Elliot] Flash forward to the 1970s.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.110
The year was 1955.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.989
Your mother and I, now married,
were ready to start a family.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.409
Diane, I long to be with child.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.828
Well, then you can't use
those condoms that you love.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.497
[Elliot] Now that was the night
we conceived Judd.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.041
[Nick] Dad, are you on a bunch
of painkillers for your surgery?

14:36.125 --> 14:38.919
I am. It's the Randy Quaid cocktail.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.756
[Elliot] Â A few years later,
flash forward to 1955.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.259
It was the 80s, and greet was good.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.136
Look, I'm the movie Baby Boom.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.722
I've got career on the brain,
but also these three kids.

14:49.805 --> 14:50.806
So now I'm on the pill.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.600
Folks, what's the deal with baths?

14:52.683 --> 14:54.226
Why do I never wanna take one?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.854
But then once I'm out,
and I come down in my pajammies,

14:56.937 --> 14:57.813
I'm so happy.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.232
Anyway, that's my time.
You've been a great family.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.150
Good night.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.443
Argh!

15:02.526 --> 15:04.361
[Elliot] Our family was complete,

15:04.445 --> 15:07.740
and now it's my turn to take over
our reproductive destiny,

15:07.823 --> 15:09.408
by getting a vasectomy.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.995
Nickie, my final child,
hold my soft moist hand

15:13.078 --> 15:15.664
while this crustacean slices open
my scrotum.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.582
Oof!

15:16.665 --> 15:18.584
-I love you, Nikki
-I love you too, dad.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.753
[muffled shouting]

15:24.048 --> 15:26.675
Barbara, did you touch
my box of peach pits?

15:26.759 --> 15:29.762
I'm looking for the one I was sucking
on the toilet last week.Â It's not here.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.264
You're asking me
if I took your toilet pit?

15:32.348 --> 15:34.683
Yeah, I like to suck
the fiber out of the ridges.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.019
This one was perfect.
It was a sucker's dream.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.979
No, Marty. I did not.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.982
Fine. Andrew! Did you lay
your grubby hands on my pits?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.609
[growls]

15:43.692 --> 15:45.361
[man on radio]
You're listening to the radio,

15:45.444 --> 15:49.114
which means you're either in a rental car
or the community room in nursing home.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.450
Up next,
another song we've chosen for you.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.577
Deee-Lite's 1990 classic,

15:53.661 --> 15:54.787
"Groove Is in the Heart."

16:01.085 --> 16:02.336
âª Dig âª

16:10.094 --> 16:12.429
âª The chills that you spill up my back âª

16:12.763 --> 16:15.307
âª Keep me filled with satisfaction
When we're done âª

16:15.391 --> 16:17.643
âª Satisfaction of what's to come âª

16:17.893 --> 16:20.646
âª No, I couldn't ask for another âª

16:33.993 --> 16:37.496
âª Groove is in the heart âª

16:37.955 --> 16:41.000
âª Groove is in the heart âª

16:41.917 --> 16:44.920
âª Groove is in the heart âª

16:45.004 --> 16:47.006
âª Astronomical âª

16:56.932 --> 16:59.643
-âª Watch out âª
-âª The depth of hula groove âª

16:59.727 --> 17:01.603
âª Move us to the nth hoop âª

17:01.729 --> 17:04.648
âª We're going through to

17:05.441 --> 17:06.817
âª I couldn't ask for another âª

âª Not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious âª

17:21.582 --> 17:24.084
âª I couldn't ask for another âª

17:24.334 --> 17:25.335

I do.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.955
âª Blow them all along âª

18:06.210 --> 18:07.920
Well, what are we gonna name him?

18:08.003 --> 18:10.631
How about... Andrew?

18:10.714 --> 18:12.758
Andrew.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.094
[high-pitched voice]
Andrew!

18:15.177 --> 18:16.136
[normal voice]
Yeah, that works.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.432
Mom, I threw one of Dad's peach pits
at an aggressive squirrel,

18:20.516 --> 18:22.184
-and I think he knows.
-[Marty] I heard that!

18:22.267 --> 18:23.435
-Help me!
-[Marty] Andrew!

18:23.519 --> 18:24.353
Aw!

18:24.436 --> 18:28.065
âª I couldn't ask for anotherÂ âª

18:31.068 --> 18:33.779
Busted!
Planned Parenthood does do abortions.

18:33.862 --> 18:37.407
Yeah, because women have the right
to choose what happens to their bodies.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.202
Oh, shit. I'm gonnaÂ get
some Twitter comments about this.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.830
They're gonna be mean and threatening,
and weirdly personal.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.206
You okay, Andrew?

18:44.289 --> 18:47.668
-These things, they're just skits, right?
-Most of them are,

18:47.751 --> 18:50.087
but that one seems like
it really happened.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.588
-It does, doesn't it?
-Ha-ha!

18:51.672 --> 18:53.423
Andrew's older brother is an abortion.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.467
Your brothers make you eat cum crackers.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.511
My mom says that's how I get my nutrients!

18:57.594 --> 19:00.597
Sex is... so complicated.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.433
I know.
And we haven't even talked about STDs.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.645
-STDs?
-Oh, no! I think this one's gonna be scary.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.357
Be careful, black and white Andrew!

19:12.568 --> 19:14.153
-Andrew!
-Lola...

19:14.236 --> 19:15.654
how do you know where I live?

19:15.737 --> 19:18.240
I googled it, you chinless turd.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.577
Because I needed to tell you
that you gave me Blue Waffle.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.036
Blue Waffle? What's that?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.079
Don't lie!

19:24.204 --> 19:27.791
It's an STD that makes your vagenitals
look like this.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.418
[screaming]

19:29.501 --> 19:31.003
Is that you?

19:31.086 --> 19:32.337
No, but it will be.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.090
Right now, I'm just, like, super itchy.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.592
But we didn't even have sex.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.261
Our tongues did, dummy.
We Frenched!

19:40.345 --> 19:41.471
Oh God. We did.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.141
Wait, what happens
when guys get Blue Waffle?

19:44.224 --> 19:47.728
Your dick busts open
and it turns into a bumpy blue waffle,

19:47.811 --> 19:50.689
and you can't even put ice cream on it
'cause it's too hot.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.858
-It's hot?
-No duh, Andrew.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.194
It's pulsing with, like, dick fever.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.071
You can't tell anybody about it,

19:58.155 --> 20:01.158
'cause no one will ever speak to you
or touch you ever again.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.368
Lola, isn't there anything I can do?

20:03.452 --> 20:05.954
You might as well
go to a Doubletree Hotel buffet

20:06.038 --> 20:08.415
and stick your dick in a waffle maker,

20:08.498 --> 20:12.002
'cause your life is over,
you blue-dicked buffoon!

20:14.254 --> 20:16.965
Okay, symptoms.
After contracting Blue Waffle,

20:17.049 --> 20:20.469
your penis will swell until it sprouts?

20:20.552 --> 20:22.763
Oh my God, Andrew.
It's worse than I thought.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.722
-I know.
-[sniffs]

20:25.182 --> 20:26.934
Andrew, what's happening?

20:27.017 --> 20:28.810
-Help me.
-I don't know how!

20:28.894 --> 20:29.728
[knocking on door]

20:29.811 --> 20:31.730
[Marty] Andrew!
What's all the screaming about?

20:31.813 --> 20:33.190
I'm fine.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.734
Actually, I'm starting to feel better.
[retching]

20:35.817 --> 20:37.527
-[door opens]
-What's going on with you, Andrew?

20:37.611 --> 20:40.447
Mom, Dad, I have Blue Waffle.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.449
You weren't supposed to say anything!

20:43.283 --> 20:46.620
Andrew, what have you done to us?

20:46.995 --> 20:50.249
I'm never going to get this off the walls!

20:51.083 --> 20:53.502
This stops here.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.254
Run, sweetheart, run.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.673
[gunshot]

20:57.756 --> 20:59.591
Maury! Shit!

20:59.675 --> 21:01.718
[gunshots]

21:01.802 --> 21:03.679
I need help. Anybody?

21:03.762 --> 21:06.306
-I need help!
-[Missy] Hey Andrew! Over here!

21:06.390 --> 21:07.808
How about some hanky-panky?

21:07.891 --> 21:08.976
-Hubba-hubba style.
-What?

21:09.059 --> 21:12.312
Let's climb all over each other
while we listen to the Mets.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.439
Missy, that sounds amazing,

21:14.523 --> 21:16.650
but I can't!

21:16.733 --> 21:19.278
What's wrong?
Don't you want to canoodle?

21:19.361 --> 21:22.322
Put your finger in my hoodle?
Come on, you sexy doodle.

21:22.739 --> 21:23.949
Missy, no! Don't!

21:24.032 --> 21:26.076
Gah-waska! What's wrong with me?

21:26.159 --> 21:28.996
I'm so sorry, Missy.
I just gave you Blue Waffle!

21:29.079 --> 21:31.081
-Is this supposed to be happening--
-[gunshot]

21:31.164 --> 21:33.458
Oh, fuck! Her fucking nose is in my hands!

21:34.293 --> 21:36.336
-[thuds]
-I shot your kid girlfriend

21:36.420 --> 21:39.756
because you're ruined my walls
with your sex disease.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.216
[gunshot]

21:42.801 --> 21:45.387
-Nick! Let me in!
-Hey, buddy.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.180
Ah! I'm so glad to see you.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.932
You, too.
You're my best friend, Andrew.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.976
Come on in. Leah made us a Dorito cake.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.394
Hey, Andrew.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.981
I've decided it's cool
that you're a disgusting pervert.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.691
Oh, that's a huge relief,

21:57.774 --> 21:59.985
'cause I just found out
I have a pervert's disease.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.403
-Blue Waffle?
-Yeah, you know it.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.156
That's fine. Just relax.
Duke's hanging out, too.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.241
-Get out.
-What?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.326
Get out!

22:10.162 --> 22:12.039
What happened?

22:12.122 --> 22:15.000
Oh my God!
Nick! Leah! Someone! Help!

22:15.334 --> 22:17.044
We are helping best friend.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.171
Yeah, before you infect anyone else,

22:19.254 --> 22:22.341
we're gonna chop your rotten dick off.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.926
That's what I was hoping
you weren't gonna do!

22:25.010 --> 22:27.220
Don't worry.
I'll do it nice and slow.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.973
[screaming]

22:30.724 --> 22:34.019
What's the matter, Judd?
Feeling a little blue?

22:34.102 --> 22:37.230
-Andrew, I was cool. Did you hear that?
-Yes, it was funny. Come on, keep moving.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.984
-Andrew, your STD is killing everyone!
-Argh!

22:41.068 --> 22:42.569
Eat a dick, Nick!

22:44.488 --> 22:46.490
Suck on my diarrhea, Leah!

22:47.657 --> 22:49.034
Like, gross!

22:49.117 --> 22:51.995
Maury, I owe you my life.
How did you do that, by the way?

22:52.079 --> 22:53.622
How did you spray that much diarrhea?

22:53.705 --> 22:54.539
Maury!

22:54.623 --> 22:55.957
[Andrew panting]

22:58.543 --> 23:00.087
Whoa! What the--

23:01.630 --> 23:02.798
"Planned Parenthood?"

23:02.881 --> 23:05.967
Yeah, are you crazy?
That place is just for girls.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.721
Everyone, listen! I have Blue Waffle.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.139
Can you please help me?

23:11.223 --> 23:13.016
Honey, I'm sorry. I can't.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.643
Is it because I didn't sign in?

23:14.726 --> 23:18.063
No, it's because Blue Waffle is not real.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.899
-Wait, what?
-Then what's going on with my body?

23:20.982 --> 23:24.569
Is the violent diarrhea because I brush
my teeth with raw chicken?

23:24.653 --> 23:27.239
Blue Waffle is an urban legend.

23:27.322 --> 23:28.490
It's a complete hoax.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.991
Oh, thank God.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.785
STDs are fake.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.996
Well, no. STDs are real,
but they are treatable.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.708
And I wish people would come in
and get tested before they start googling

23:38.792 --> 23:40.085
and driving themselves crazy.

23:40.168 --> 23:44.089
Food for thought, but one more time:
Blue Waffle is not real, right?

23:44.172 --> 23:46.425
One more time, it is not real.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.676
-But, Andrew?
-What?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.011
-Slender Man is.
-[Andrew screaming]

23:53.640 --> 23:55.475
Andrew, that was upsetting.

23:55.559 --> 23:59.146
Yeah, especially the whole nightmare
scenario of you making out with Lola.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.022
Yeah, that's crazy.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.316
That's, you know, magical realism.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.527
Whoa, whoa, whoa!Â Stop the clock!

24:05.610 --> 24:08.155
I think I understand
Planned Parenthood now.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.072
Really? You do?

24:09.156 --> 24:12.659
Yeah! They do medicine
for your bathing suit parts.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.286
Yeah, basically.

24:14.369 --> 24:17.038
Steve, you actually learned something.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.957
I did? I did.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.170
Oh, thank you, everybody.
And thank you all for watching.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.172
What an incredible week!

24:25.255 --> 24:29.634
You know, it's always been a dream
of mine to host whatever this is.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.721
I want to thank Deee-Lite
for "Groove is in the Heart,"

24:32.804 --> 24:35.807
Bootsy Collins, Nathan Fillion,
you're a real sport.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.309
-I love you!
-The whole cast.

24:37.392 --> 24:41.313
The cue card guy for drawing
my dialogue in pictures.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.566
Lorne, the pull out method, Slender Man.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.525
I love you, dude.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.403
I can't forget the Liberal League
for their awesome agenda.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.446
You guys rocked it.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.324
You convinced us to do an episode
on Planned Parenthood,

24:52.407 --> 24:56.203
even though so many people
are gonna be furious at us for doing it.

24:56.286 --> 25:00.874
And don't forget,
Blue Waffle is absolutely real!

25:00.957 --> 25:03.293
-No, it's not!
-I love you! Goodnight!

25:03.376 --> 25:05.629
Stick around for Showtime at the Apollo

25:05.712 --> 25:10.091
or a Cindy Crawford
melon skin cream infomercial.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.301
