10:12.873 --> 10:14.309
I don't know.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.137
But sometimes,
I can see what he sees.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.878
If you give it to me, I think
I can use it to find him.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.923

10:19.967 --> 10:21.055

10:21.098 --> 10:22.970

10:23.013 --> 10:26.190
it appears whenever
you two are together.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.323
It looks to me like
the two of you are powering up.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.891
Private Harris
confirmed as much.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.502
If that thing
made me stronger,

10:33.545 --> 10:35.547

Tag to take it?

Again, Private Harris
said it landed at his feet.

50 pushups in a minute?

I would've invited Candice,

He could just be in a bad mood.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.234
Maybe.

27:51.278 --> 27:54.498

a bunch of days in a row

I was in a bad mood.

a switch just turned off.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.553

deeper and painful,

28:05.596 --> 28:08.556

totally different person.

We're gonna deal with this
as a family.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.206
I promise.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.208
But right now,
we're gonna walk in there

36:07.252 --> 36:09.645
and we're gonna celebrate
this wonderful occasion

36:09.689 --> 36:11.081
with our family and friends.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.996
I don't think--

36:13.040 --> 36:14.259
I don't think I can do it.

36:14.302 --> 36:17.305
Sweetheart, we've got this.

Thank you all
for coming tonight.

36:49.424 --> 36:53.298
It means so much to us
to be surrounded

36:53.341 --> 36:55.909
by our family and friends--

36:55.952 --> 36:59.608
all of you who have
watched Sarah grow

36:59.652 --> 37:02.916
into the woman
that she is today.

37:02.959 --> 37:06.049
So often when we think
about our kids,

37:06.093 --> 37:09.314
we go back to the moments
when they were little

37:09.357 --> 37:11.533
and they needed us
to pick them up

37:11.577 --> 37:13.579
and kiss away their tears.

37:13.622 --> 37:16.190
I miss those days.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.800
I won't lie.

37:17.844 --> 37:20.150
I miss them.

37:20.194 --> 37:23.023
They were some of the best
of my life.

37:23.066 --> 37:28.463
But I'd rather be here
right now because of this

37:28.507 --> 37:31.249
unbelievable young woman

37:31.292 --> 37:35.078
that's standing
before you tonight.

37:35.122 --> 37:40.823
Sarah is someone who will
always fight for what's right,

37:40.867 --> 37:42.651
even when it's hard.

37:42.695 --> 37:46.176
She is a daughter strong enough

37:46.220 --> 37:48.309
to pick me up

37:48.353 --> 37:52.139
and wipe away my tears and...

37:52.182 --> 37:55.273
There sure are a lot of those
sometimes.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.102
Sweetheart,

37:59.146 --> 38:02.671
you are my inspiration.

38:02.715 --> 38:05.283
You're my heart.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.764
You're my best friend.

38:08.808 --> 38:13.160
And there's nothing
I would change

38:13.203 --> 38:18.383
if I can just keep you
by my side.

38:18.426 --> 38:20.341

Just make sure
no one sees you go.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.905
I've never seen
anything like it.

39:02.949 --> 39:05.386
He's your opposite
in so many ways,

Hey.

39:35.242 --> 39:36.461
I just, um,

39:36.504 --> 39:38.941
I just wanted to say

39:38.985 --> 39:40.595
I'm sorry about
what happened with Sarah.

39:40.639 --> 39:41.857
Really sucks.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.381
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:49.082 --> 39:53.216
John, what--
what's going on, man?

39:53.260 --> 39:55.697
Can we just not
get into this right now?

39:55.741 --> 39:57.960
Come on, keeping secrets
never works out.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.832
Says the guy

39:59.875 --> 40:01.355
literally keeping
a massive secret.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.314
Dude, can you just--
can you just for once, like,

40:04.358 --> 40:07.579
just quit acting like
you know everything.

40:07.622 --> 40:09.624
Yeah, well,
can you quit lying to my face?

40:09.668 --> 40:11.974
I'm not lying!

40:15.238 --> 40:16.805
- You have powers?
- Jordan--

40:16.849 --> 40:18.590
No wonder you were so much
stronger this morning.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.592
Why didn't you just
tell me, man?

40:20.635 --> 40:22.681
Okay, I just--

40:22.724 --> 40:25.205
they just started come in
like a couple days ago,

40:25.248 --> 40:26.554
and I just--

40:26.598 --> 40:28.861
like, I wanted
to get a feel for them.

40:28.904 --> 40:30.166
Come on, come on.
We gotta go tell Mom and Dad.

40:30.210 --> 40:31.341
No, no, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:31.385 --> 40:32.560
Can you just--look.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.475
Can I just have
a little bit longer?

40:34.519 --> 40:36.129
Yeah, they're gonna
find out anyway.

40:36.172 --> 40:37.739
I get that, but...

40:37.783 --> 40:39.393
my powers have barely started
coming in,

40:39.437 --> 40:40.699
and you know that Dad's gonna
pull me off the team

40:40.742 --> 40:42.788
as soon as he finds out,
right?

40:42.831 --> 40:45.138
- Yeah, probably.
- Exactly, okay?

40:45.181 --> 40:47.706
So can I just get a couple days

40:47.749 --> 40:49.925
just to figure this out
before he gets involved?

40:53.059 --> 40:54.408
It's Sarah.
I gotta take this.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.628
Okay--hey.
Can we talk about this later?

40:56.671 --> 40:58.760
Please?
- Yeah, man.

40:58.804 --> 41:00.588

The woman whose life
he just saved.
