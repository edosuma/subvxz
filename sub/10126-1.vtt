09:15.800 --> 09:17.367
ERIC. YOU'RE
STILL HERE.

09:17.367 --> 09:20.367
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?
WE HAD A GREAT NIGHT
TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE?

09:20.367 --> 09:22.300
YEAH, WE DID.
UM, I WAS THINKING

09:22.300 --> 09:24.400
MAYBE
YOU FOUND SOMEONE
MORE INTERESTING

09:24.400 --> 09:26.867
AND I WASN'T GOING
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.934
WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE VERY INTERESTING.

09:28.934 --> 09:31.033
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

09:31.033 --> 09:33.500
DO YOU WANT TO SAY
HI TO MY FRIENDS?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.200
THEY'RE REAL EAGER
TO MEET YOU.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.100
OH, AND THE LITTLE
HITCHHIKER BOY

09:37.100 --> 09:38.734
IS MORE THAN WELCOME
TO JOIN US.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
NO, THIS IS WHERE

09:41.000 --> 09:42.600
THE LITTLE HITCHHIKER
BOY SAYS GOOD-BYE.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.800
SO, ERIC, IF YOU'RE
STAYING, THEN THERE'S
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY

09:45.800 --> 09:49.400
EXCEPT
I'LL BE THE ONE DRIVING
THROUGH THE CORN FIELD.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.900
OK, FINE, AT LEAST
LET ME CHECK TO SEE

09:51.900 --> 09:53.200
IF YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT KEYS.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.700
WHAT A MORON!

09:58.500 --> 10:00.834
WELL, YOU CAN
TAKE THE KEYS, ERIC,

10:00.834 --> 10:04.200
BUT YOU CAN'T
TAKE MY FREEDOM!

10:06.400 --> 10:08.233
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT HIM.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.000
NOBODY IN THIS TOWN
WILL PICK HIM UP.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
WHY?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.133
WELL, 'CAUSE EVERYONE
IN TOWN IS HERE.

10:14.133 --> 10:17.033
QUAINT. I LIKE THAT.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.300
WHAT?

10:23.900 --> 10:25.700
WELL, THAT WAS NICE.
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.767
YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM
ANY GUY I'VE EVER MET.

10:27.767 --> 10:31.667
WHEN YOU TALK TO ME,
YOU LOOK IN MY EYES,
AND..,

10:31.667 --> 10:32.800
AND WHAT?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.500
WHEN I HEAR YOUR VOICE,
IT SOUNDS REALLY SMART,

10:35.500 --> 10:37.867
AND THAT MAKES ME
FEEL SPECIAL.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.400
ME, TOO.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.567
SO, ANY TIME
YOU'RE READY TO OPEN UP,

10:49.567 --> 10:52.600
I'M READY TO LISTEN.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.967
I BLAME YOU.

10:58.967 --> 11:00.066
WHAT?

11:00.066 --> 11:02.200
I BLAME YOU.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.500
I ONLY KEPT THIS JOB
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

11:05.500 --> 11:07.400
YOU AND THE--
AND THE--

11:07.400 --> 11:08.400
KIDS?

11:08.400 --> 11:09.867
YEAH, THE KIDS.

11:09.867 --> 11:13.667
I WAS JUST A BAG BOY
WHO DIDN'T HAVE
SENSE ENOUGH TO LEAVE.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.500
AND NOW THAT'S WHAT I AM
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
ALAN, WHAT YOU DO
FOR A LIVING

11:18.500 --> 11:20.400
IS ONLY A LITTLE
OF WHAT YOU ARE.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.400
IT'S NOT MOSTLY
WHAT YOU ARE.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.000
WELL, THEN
WHAT AM I, MOSTLY?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.934
MOSTLY...

11:27.934 --> 11:30.100
YOU ARE A PERSON

11:30.100 --> 11:32.600
THAT I LOVE
A WHOLE LOT,

11:32.600 --> 11:35.600
AND I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.734
WELL, RIGHT NOW
I AM NOT HAPPY

11:38.734 --> 11:42.100
SETTLING
FOR WHAT I AM.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.367
WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

12:10.400 --> 12:11.600
GEORGE.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.834
HMM?

12:13.834 --> 12:17.400
DO YOU HATE
YOUR JOB OR WHAT?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.000
NO.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.867
THE ONLY JOB
I EVER HATED

12:20.867 --> 12:22.300
WAS THAT
HORRIBLE JOB

12:22.300 --> 12:25.467
AS A BAG BOY
AT THE SUPERMARKET.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.300
I'M CERTAINLY GLAD
I HAD THE SENSE

12:28.300 --> 12:31.033
TO GET OUT OF THAT
AFTER ABOUT A DAY.

12:31.033 --> 12:34.467
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING,
HAVEN'T YOU?

12:34.467 --> 12:36.200
VOICES CARRY.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
SERIOUSLY,
GEORGE,

12:37.200 --> 12:39.500
YOU'VE
BEEN A TEACHER
ALL YOUR LIFE.

12:39.500 --> 12:43.500
DO YOU STILL
ENJOY GETTING UP
IN THE MORNING?

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
OH, ALAN,

12:44.500 --> 12:47.800
IT WOULD BE VERY EASY
FOR ME TO TELL YOU

12:47.800 --> 12:51.000
THAT I HAVE DEDICATED
THE LAST 38 YEARS

12:51.000 --> 12:54.200
TO SEVERAL THOUSAND
YOUNG MINDS

12:54.200 --> 12:56.500
AND THAT IS MY
CHIEF JOY AND REASON

12:56.500 --> 12:58.700
FOR GETTING UP
IN THE MORNING.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.000
EXCEPT IT ISN'T.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.567
I TEACH
BECAUSE I LIKE IT.

13:03.567 --> 13:06.400
AND BECAUSE
IT'S FUN FOR ME.

13:06.400 --> 13:10.500
AH, BUT WHEN
IT STOPS BEING FUN?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.300
WELL, THEN,

13:12.300 --> 13:14.400
I SUPPOSE
I WOULD LOOK

13:14.400 --> 13:17.867
TO MY FAMILY AND
FRIENDS FOR SUPPORT

13:17.867 --> 13:21.467
TO HELP ME
FIND SOMETHING NEW.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.500
WELL, THANK YOU,
GEORGE.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.233
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME
SOMETHING.

13:31.567 --> 13:34.233
AND IT WAS
FUN FOR ME.

13:39.967 --> 13:41.033
AH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

13:41.033 --> 13:44.100
I MEAN, WHO WOULD POSSIBLY
STOP AND PICK ME UP

13:44.100 --> 13:46.567
IN THE MIDDLE
OF RURAL PENNSYLVANIA?

13:46.567 --> 13:48.567
[HOOFBEATS]

13:48.567 --> 13:49.600
WHOA.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.300
YOUNG FRIEND,
HOW FAR ART THOU
TRAVELING?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.300
ME?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.100
YES, THEE.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.100
AH, WELL, I'M GOING
TO PHILADELPHIA.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.867
WELL, I'M
GOING AS FAR AS...

14:01.867 --> 14:05.100
THAT FARMHOUSE
THERE.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.934
THAT FARMHOUSE THERE?

14:06.934 --> 14:08.033
YES.

14:08.033 --> 14:10.734
THAT FARMHOUSE
THERE.

14:10.734 --> 14:12.600
I SEE.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.233
WELL, I'M GOING
TO PHILADELPHIA.

14:14.233 --> 14:18.834
WELL, I COULD TAKE
YOU AS FAR AS...

14:18.834 --> 14:20.900
THAT FARMHOUSE
THERE.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.233
AND THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU, BUT MAYBE

14:23.233 --> 14:25.667
I'LL JUST WAIT FOR
SOME FORM OF TRANSPORTATION

14:25.667 --> 14:27.867
THAT INVOLVES COMBUSTION.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.367
I UNDERSTAND.

14:29.367 --> 14:33.367
BUT IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND,
I'LL BE AT...

14:33.367 --> 14:35.734
THAT FARMHOUSE
THERE.

14:35.734 --> 14:37.934
YES, BUT YOU SEE,
IF THAT'S AS FAR
AS YOU'RE GOING,

14:37.934 --> 14:39.567
IT DOES ME NO GOOD.

14:39.567 --> 14:40.600
THAT IS TRUE.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.967
BUT MY INTENT
WAS JUST,

14:42.967 --> 14:45.567
AND MY HEART
IS PURE.

14:47.767 --> 14:50.767
ALSO DOES ME NO GOOD.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.467
FRANKLY, THAT'S
THE BEST DARN PEA SOUP

15:03.467 --> 15:04.500
I'VE EVER HAD.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.900
HERE. IT'S THE SOUP
THAT BRINGS YOU IN,

15:06.900 --> 15:09.400
BUT IT'S THE PIE
THAT KEEPS YOU HERE
FOREVER.

15:10.734 --> 15:13.800
I WAS
ONLY 3 HOURS
FROM HOME.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.367
OH. OH!

15:21.367 --> 15:24.000
THAT IS DELICIOUS!
WHAT KIND IS THIS?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.467
PIE.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.967
PIE. WELL, YOU KNOW,
WITH FOOD THIS GOOD,

15:27.967 --> 15:29.467
YOU MUST HAVE PEOPLE
LINING UP TO GET HERE.

15:29.467 --> 15:34.500
THE TRUTH IS,
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO
HAVE TO CLOSE HER DOWN.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.600
IRENE?

15:35.600 --> 15:36.800
I'M AFRAID IT'S
TRUE. I MEAN,

15:36.800 --> 15:38.567
EVER SINCE
THEY BUILT
THE NEW HIGHWAY,

15:38.567 --> 15:40.200
FOLKS KIND OF
JUST BLOW BY
THIS TOWN.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.100
WELL, THEY WOULDN'T
IF THEY KNEW HOW GOOD
YOUR SOUP AND PIE ARE.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.567
I TOLD YOU THAT.

15:45.567 --> 15:46.867
OK NOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS IS ANYTHING,

15:46.867 --> 15:49.967
BUT WHEN I WAS
DRIVING THROUGH TEXAS,
I STARTED NOTICING

15:49.967 --> 15:52.100
ALL THESE SIGNS ADVERTISING
THE WORLD'S BEST CHILI,

15:52.100 --> 15:55.300
AND, LIKE, EVERY MILE,
THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER SIGN
THAT'D SAY, LIKE,

15:55.300 --> 15:57.500
"100 MILES TO
THE WORLD'S BEST CHILI."

15:57.500 --> 15:58.500
"99 MILES." "98 MILES."

15:58.500 --> 16:00.667
SO BY THE TIME
I FINALLY GOT THERE,

16:00.667 --> 16:03.200
I JUST HAD TO HAVE
SOME OF THIS CHILI.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.100
YOU SEE?

16:05.100 --> 16:07.800
IT'S PIE.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.800
NO, WHAT ERIC'S SAYING

16:08.800 --> 16:10.700
IS THAT WE PUT SIGNS UP
ON OUR HIGHWAY

16:10.700 --> 16:12.467
CHATTING UP
OUR SOUP AND PIE.

16:12.467 --> 16:15.133
YOU'RE A REAL SMART
YOUNG MAN, ERIC.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.233
YOU THINK SO?

16:16.233 --> 16:18.800
WHY, SURE.
NOW, CERTAINLY
A MAN OF THE WORLD

16:18.800 --> 16:21.200
LIKE YOURSELF
FEELS MORE AT EASE
IN THE BIG CITY,

16:21.200 --> 16:24.200
BUT A GUY LIKE YOU
COULD DO PRETTY WELL
IN A TOWN LIKE OURS.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.000
YOU THINK SO?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.500
HEY, MAYBE I WILL
STAY FOR A WHILE.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.000
REALLY?
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.300
GOOD WOMAN,
GOOD FRIENDS, GOOD PIE.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.033
I THINK I COULD
BE HAPPY HERE

16:34.033 --> 16:36.100
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.600
ERIC.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.700
LET'S SEE,

16:42.700 --> 16:44.867
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU COULD BE HAPPY HERE?

16:44.867 --> 16:47.233
I'M ALREADY
HAPPY HERE, COR.

16:47.233 --> 16:48.967
THESE PEOPLE
HAVE TAKEN ME IN.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.467
THEY'VE MADE ME
FEEL IMPORTANT.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.667
BACK HOME, I'M JUST
A LOSER WHO DIDN'T
GET INTO COLLEGE,

16:52.667 --> 16:53.667
BUT HERE,

16:53.667 --> 16:55.300
I COULD BE KING.

16:56.367 --> 16:57.834
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

16:57.834 --> 17:01.667
I'LL JUST TELL
MOM AND DAD. I KNOW
THEY'LL BE SO PROUD.

17:01.667 --> 17:02.934
I KNOW I AM.

17:02.934 --> 17:06.200
I'M THE PRINCE
OF SPRINKLE LAND.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.500
HEY. SOUP AND PIE
FOR EVERYBODY.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.467
THE NEW GUY'S BUYING.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.734
OH, MAN,
THIS IS GOOD PIE!

17:23.800 --> 17:27.000
I WAS
3 HOURS FROM HOME.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.834
DAD.

17:31.834 --> 17:32.934
CORY.

17:32.934 --> 17:36.967
DON'T EAT THE PIE.
YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.100
WHERE IS HE?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.367
OH, HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS?

17:39.367 --> 17:41.900
I BELIEVE HE'S HOLDING
COURT OVER THERE.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.600
ERIC.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.133
DAD! HEY!

17:46.133 --> 17:48.900
DAD, THESE ARE THE GUYS,
AND THIS IS IRENE.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.100
HI.
UH, NICE TO
MEET YOU, IRENE...

17:51.100 --> 17:52.100
GUYS.

17:52.100 --> 17:55.834
UH, ERIC, YOUR MOTHER
AND I DECIDED

17:55.834 --> 17:57.300
THAT YOU WERE
RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH

17:57.300 --> 17:58.300
TO TAKE YOUR BROTHER

17:58.300 --> 17:59.367
ON THE ROAD
FOR TWO MONTHS.

17:59.367 --> 18:00.967
NOW, IS THIS
THE WAY YOU THANK US?

18:00.967 --> 18:01.967
I WAS GOING TO
CALL YOU IN THE MORNING

18:01.967 --> 18:03.400
AND LET YOU KNOW
MY PLANS.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.467
I'LL TELL YOU
YOUR PLANS. YOU'RE
GOING TO GET IN YOUR CAR

18:05.467 --> 18:08.100
AND FOLLOW ME HOME
WITHOUT STOPPING
ANYWHERE.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.500
NOW. COME ON.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.100
ACTUALLY, I'D RATHER
STAY HERE WITH IRENE
AND THE GUYS.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.033
MAYBE WE BETTER
DO THIS IN PRIVATE.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.467
SO, UH...THERE'S
A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

18:21.467 --> 18:23.667
FOR A GUY LIKE ME
IN THIS TOWN?

18:23.667 --> 18:26.767
WELL,
I COULD USE A NURSE.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.934
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT THIS
IS REALLY ABOUT?

18:31.934 --> 18:34.934
I DON'T THINK
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

18:34.934 --> 18:36.500
TRY ME.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.767
I DON'T SEE THE POINT
IN GOING BACK HOME.

18:39.767 --> 18:40.867
WHY NOT?

18:40.867 --> 18:42.500
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
THERE FOR ME, DAD.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.300
I MEAN, I WENT
TO NURSERY SCHOOL,

18:44.300 --> 18:45.834
GRAMMAR SCHOOL,
HIGH SCHOOL, FOR WHAT?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.100
I MEAN, I DIDN'T
GET INTO COLLEGE.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.367
EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE UP UNTIL NOW
HAS BEEN A WASTE,

18:49.367 --> 18:51.834
AND IT'S JUST TOO LATE
TO CHANGE WHO I AM.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.567
AHA.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.567
SEE, I KNEW
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.834
HEY,
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN.

18:57.834 --> 19:01.133
THIS IS SOMETHING
I UNDERSTAND REAL WELL.

19:01.133 --> 19:02.800
I MEAN,
IT'S VERY EASY

19:02.800 --> 19:05.100
TO FIND SOME PLACE
THAT'S COMFORTABLE

19:05.100 --> 19:06.100
AND JUST...

19:06.100 --> 19:07.200
STAY THERE.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.800
NOW, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BEING COMFORTABLE?

19:08.800 --> 19:12.600
I MEAN, I THINK I COULD
DO PRETTY WELL SETTLING
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.467
BUT THAT'S IT, ERIC.

19:14.467 --> 19:15.700
THAT'S ALL
YOU'D BE DOING,

19:15.700 --> 19:17.000
JUST SETTLING.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.600
AND OVER THE YEARS,
YOU'D TRY AND
CONVINCE YOURSELF

19:19.600 --> 19:22.900
THAT THAT'S THE LIFE
YOU REALLY WANTED,
BUT YOU DON'T.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.200
I MEAN, YOU JUST
STUMBLED INTO IT,

19:25.200 --> 19:26.400
AND YOU'LL
NEVER LOVE IT,

19:26.400 --> 19:28.300
AND ONE DAY,
YOU'LL REALIZE

19:28.300 --> 19:31.400
THAT ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS SETTLE,

19:31.400 --> 19:35.967
AND YOU'LL NOT
LIKE YOURSELF FOR THAT.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.467
I DON'T LIKE
MYSELF NOW, DAD.

19:38.467 --> 19:42.600
WHAT AM I EVEN
GOING HOME TO?

19:42.600 --> 19:45.467
TO THE SUPPORT OF
YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS

19:45.467 --> 19:50.100
WHO'LL HELP YOU FIND
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.700
I'M AFRAID TO GO HOME.

19:54.767 --> 19:58.600
ERIC, YOU NEVER
HAVE TO BE AFRAID

19:58.600 --> 20:00.500
TO GO HOME.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.834
HOW ARE YOU SO SURE?

20:02.834 --> 20:05.200
BECAUSE HE'S DAD.

20:09.734 --> 20:12.033
YEAH.

20:12.033 --> 20:15.834
THAT'S MOSTLY
WHAT I AM.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.300
LET'S GO.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.900
THEY'RE UP AND
ON THEIR WAY DOWN.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.200
I TOLD THEM YOU MADE
BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.000
I DIDN'T MAKE
BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.500
AH, THEY'RE LUCKY
WE LET THEM LIVE HERE.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.200
TOPANGA, ARE YOU AND
CORY GOING TO KISS?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.200
THAT'S VERY PERSONAL

20:48.200 --> 20:49.834
AND WE SHOULDN'T
TALK ABOUT IT.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.834
COME ON, JUST
BETWEEN US GIRLS.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.000
RIGHT ON THE LIPS.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.600
TOPANGA, HE'S NOT
GOING TO HAVE TIME FOR YOU.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.133
THE MAN HAS BEEN GONE
FOR 2 MONTHS AND WE HAVE
SO MUCH CATCHING UP TO DO.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.066
HE'S NOT EVEN GOING
TO KNOW YOU EXIST.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.600
SHAWN!
CORY!

21:02.600 --> 21:04.700
HE-HE-HEY!
HEY!

21:07.367 --> 21:08.367
GOOD SUMMER?

21:08.367 --> 21:09.734
GREAT SUMMER.
LOT OF STORIES?

21:09.734 --> 21:10.900
LOT OF STORIES.
YOU MISS ME?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.100
I MISSED YOU.
WE STILL
BEST FRIENDS?

21:13.100 --> 21:14.000
THE BEST
THERE EVER WERE.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.367
GOOD.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.033
YOU SEE?

21:17.600 --> 21:19.200
YOU SEE?

21:19.200 --> 21:20.967
HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU!
