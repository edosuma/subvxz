AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE

09:20.020 --> 09:21.930
LIKE A NORMAL FAMILY.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.660
HAPPY, DAD?

09:23.730 --> 09:24.760
YES.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.630
GOOD, COMMENCE SHOVELING.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.630
NO.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.270
WE'RE GOING
TO SAY GRACE FIRST.

09:30.330 --> 09:31.970
RUB A-DUB DUB,
THANKS FOR THE GRUB.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.670
GRR.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.540
NO!

09:35.600 --> 09:37.600
IGNORE THE BOY, LORD.

09:37.670 --> 09:40.800
NOW CAN THE CHATTER
AND BOW YOUR HEADS.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.710
DEAR LORD, THANK YOU
FOR THIS MICROWAVE BOUNTY

09:43.780 --> 09:46.450
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T DESERVE IT.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.590
I MEAN, OUR KIDS
ARE UNCONTROLLABLE HELLIONS.

09:49.650 --> 09:50.860
PARDON MY FRENCH.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.320
BUT THEY ACT LIKE SAVAGES.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.930
DID YOU SEE THEM
AT THE PICNIC?

09:54.990 --> 09:56.490
OF COURSE YOU DID.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.900
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE--
YOU'RE OMNIVOROUS.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.560
OH, LORD, WHY DID YOU SMITE ME
WITH THIS FAMILY?

10:00.630 --> 10:01.570
All:
AMEN.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.730
LET'S EAT.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.200
NO, I'M NOT DONE YET.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.200
BUT HOMER, HOW LONG ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO SIT HERE

10:07.270 --> 10:10.210
AND LISTEN TO YOU BAD-MOUTH US
TO THE MAN UPSTAIRS?

10:10.270 --> 10:13.980
SOMETIMES I THINK WE'RE
THE WORST FAMILY IN TOWN.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.000
MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE
TO A LARGER COMMUNITY.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.020
D-OH!
DON'T HAVE
A COW, DAD.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.150
THE SAD TRUTH IS
ALL FAMILIES ARE LIKE US.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.790
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

10:23.850 --> 10:24.960
FOLLOW ME.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.260
LOOK AT THAT, KIDS.

10:32.330 --> 10:33.860
NO FIGHTING.
NO YELLING.

10:33.930 --> 10:35.030
Bart:
NO BELCHING.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.830
Lisa:
THE DAD HAS A SHIRT ON.

10:36.900 --> 10:37.870
Marge:
LOOK, NAPKINS.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.160
THESE PEOPLE ARE
OBVIOUSLY FREAKS.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.570
YOU THINK SO?

10:41.640 --> 10:44.310
LET'S SEE WHAT'S BEHIND
DOOR NUMBER TWO.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.630
Lisa:
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

10:45.710 --> 10:47.580
THEY'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.140
Marge:
THEY ACTUALLY ENJOY TALKING
TO EACH OTHER.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.780
I WISH I COULD HEAR THEM.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.890
PAPA, I HEARD SOME RUSTLING
IN THE BUSHES.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.450
I DID, TOO.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.860
BETTER GET THE GUN.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.060
WHERE'S HE GOING?

11:00.120 --> 11:03.390
PROBABLY TO GET THE OLD MAN
HIS PIPE AND SLIPPERS.

11:03.460 --> 11:04.630
( <i>rifle cocks )</i>

11:13.970 --> 11:16.740
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.110
WHAT A DUMP.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.170
IT'S WORSE THAN YOU THINK.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.450
I JUST TRAMPLED
THIS POOR SAP'S FLOWER BED.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.320
HOMER, THIS IS OUR HOUSE.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.150
AH!

11:26.210 --> 11:28.480
ARE YOU COMING IN, HOMER?

11:28.550 --> 11:30.960
NO, NO. I WANT TO BE ALONE
WITH MY THOUGHT.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.230
Fans are getting anxious.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.530
ANOTHER BEER, MOE.

11:35.590 --> 11:37.260
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HOMER?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.230
BLOODIEST FIGHT
OF THE YEAR.

11:39.290 --> 11:41.790
YOU'RE SITTIN' THERE LIKE
A THIRSTY BUMP ON A LOG.

11:41.860 --> 11:42.890
EDDIE.

11:42.960 --> 11:43.820
EVENING, MOE.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.140
WANT SOME PRETZELS?

11:45.200 --> 11:46.440
NO THANKS. WE'RE ON DUTY.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.840
A COUPLE BEERS WOULD BE NICE.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.500
THAT WILL BE
TWO BUCKS, BOYS.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.240
JUST KIDDING.

11:51.310 --> 11:52.710
GOOD ONE, MOE.

11:52.770 --> 11:55.100
LISTEN, WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A FAMILY OF PEEPING TOMS

11:55.180 --> 11:57.050
WHO'VE BEEN TERRORIZING THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.520
QUIET, BOY.
LET THE NICE PEOPLE
ENJOY THEIR BEERS.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.320
DON'T WORRY.

12:01.380 --> 12:04.040
THIS DOG HAS
THE SCENT.

12:04.120 --> 12:04.960
WHAT'S WITH, BOBO?

12:05.020 --> 12:08.130
I GOT SOME WIENERS IN MY POCKET.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.230
IT FIGURES.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.260
COME ON

12:10.330 --> 12:11.260
YOU STUPID DOG.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.960
YOU KNOW, MOE

12:15.030 --> 12:17.940
MY MOM ONCE SAID SOMETHING
THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.710
SHE SAID, "HOMER,
YOU'RE A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT."

12:22.770 --> 12:24.780
AND GOD BLESS HER SOUL.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.240
SHE WAS REALLY
ON TO SOMETHING.

12:27.310 --> 12:30.050
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF, HOMER.
YOU GOT DEALT A BAD HAND.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.380
YOU GOT CRUMMY KIDS
THAT NOBODY CAN CONTROL.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.550
YOU CAN'T TALK THAT WAY
ABOUT MY KIDS.

12:34.620 --> 12:35.620
OR AT LEAST TWO OF THEM.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.280
WHY? YOU GOT TWO
I HAVEN'T MET?

12:38.350 --> 12:39.480
HERE'S FIVE YOU HAVEN'T MET.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.050
And a tremendous right.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.280
This fight is over.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.200
( <i>cheering )</i>

12:46.260 --> 12:49.000
<i>All Star Boxing
is brought to you by</i>

12:49.060 --> 12:51.890
Dr. Marvin Monroe's
Family Therapy Center.

12:51.970 --> 12:52.970
HUH?

12:53.030 --> 12:53.990
WHAT?

12:54.070 --> 12:56.010
Aren't you going
to work today?

12:56.070 --> 12:57.510
I don't think so.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.970
Your problem won't get better
till you admit it.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.600
I admit this--
shut your big yap!

13:03.680 --> 13:05.280
Oh, you shut up.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.280
No, you shut up.

13:07.350 --> 13:08.720
Both: Shut up!

13:08.780 --> 13:11.180
Why don't you
<i>both shut up?!</i>

13:11.250 --> 13:13.080
Hi friends.
I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe.

13:13.150 --> 13:15.220
Does this scene look familiar?

13:15.290 --> 13:17.290
If so, I can help.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.460
No gimmicks. No pills.
No fad diets.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.100
Just family bliss

13:22.160 --> 13:24.060
or double your money back.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.340
So call today.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.840
Dr. Marvin Monroe's
Family Therapy Center.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.330
Why don't you call right now?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.010
WHEN WILL I LEARN?

13:33.070 --> 13:35.500
THE ANSWER TO LIFE'S PROBLEMS

13:35.580 --> 13:38.280
AREN'T AT THE BOTTOM
OF A BOTTLE.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.450
THEY'RE ON TV!

13:51.190 --> 13:52.920
( <i>kids laughing )</i>

13:52.990 --> 13:55.390
ALRIGHT.
TIME FOR A FAMILY MEETING.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.830
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A MEETING
WHEN <i>YOU'RE WATCHING TV?</i>

13:57.900 --> 14:00.140
NOW LOOK.
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW

14:00.200 --> 14:02.910
THIS FAMILY NEEDS
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.480
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. MARVIN MONROE.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.010
THE FAT GUY ON TV?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.180
YOU'RE SENDING US TO A DOCTOR

14:09.240 --> 14:10.700
WHO ADVERTISES
ON PRO WRESTLING?

14:10.780 --> 14:12.150
BOXING, LISA, BOXING.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.410
THERE'S A
WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.790
ARE YOU SURE THIS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

14:15.850 --> 14:18.490
I'VE GIVEN THIS MATTER
A LOT OF STUDY,

14:18.550 --> 14:20.080
AND OF ALL THE
COMMERCIALS I SAW,

14:20.160 --> 14:21.290
HIS WAS THE BEST.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.430
ALL IT COSTS IS $250.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.820
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.790
WE'LL THEN,
WE'LL HAVE TO DIG DEEP.

14:27.860 --> 14:30.420
MARGE, GO GET THE KIDS'
COLLEGE FUND.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.340
HEY!

14:31.400 --> 14:32.640
OH, HOMER!

14:32.700 --> 14:34.200
WHY SCRIMP NOW

14:34.270 --> 14:37.810
ON THE OFF CHANCE
THEY'LL ACTUALLY
GET IN SOMEPLACE?

14:37.870 --> 14:40.900
48, 49, 50.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.110
$88.50.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.720
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S THE COLLEGE FUND
WE'VE BEEN SAVING FOR

14:45.780 --> 14:47.380
ALL THESE YEARS?!

14:47.450 --> 14:49.820
I GUESS I'D HAVE NEEDED
A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.150
WE'RE NOT LICKED YET.

14:51.220 --> 14:52.720
TO SAVE THIS FAMILY

14:52.790 --> 14:54.830
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE
THE SUPREME SACRIFICE.

14:54.890 --> 14:58.330
NO, DAD, PLEASE
DON'T PAWN THE TV.

14:58.390 --> 15:01.060
ANYTHING BUT THAT.

15:01.130 --> 15:04.100
HOMER, COULDN'T WE PAWN
MY ENGAGEMENT RING INSTEAD?

15:04.170 --> 15:08.640
I APPRECIATE THAT, HONEY,
BUT WE NEED $150 HERE.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.900
AFTERNOON, SIMPSON.

15:09.970 --> 15:12.180
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

15:12.240 --> 15:16.480
WOULD YOU PAY $150
FOR THIS LOVELY MOTOROLA?

15:16.540 --> 15:17.910
IS IT CABLE-READY?

15:17.980 --> 15:19.950
READY AS SHE'LL EVER BE.

15:20.010 --> 15:22.440
MISTER, YOU GOT
YOURSELF A DEAL.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.830
Marge:
ALL OUR MONEY,
THE COLLEGE FUNDS, THE TV.

15:29.890 --> 15:33.400
HOMER, YOU'RE DRIVING
A STAKE THROUGH THE HEARTS

15:33.460 --> 15:34.800
OF THOSE WHO LOVE YOU.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.620
HEY, NO PAIN, NO GAIN.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.340
WILL YOU BE PAYING
BY CASH OR CHECK?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.740
CASH, OF COURSE.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.440
I'VE GOT $250
RIGHT HERE WITH ME.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.970
I'M HOLDING IT RIGHT NOW.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.940
HERE IT IS.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.280
CHECK IT OUT.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.100
250 BIG ONES.

15:50.180 --> 15:53.680
IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS HER
SHOW HER THE BIG, EMPTY SPACE
WHERE OUR TV WAS.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.150
- BART!
- COME ONE FAMILY.
LET'S GO CELEBRATE

15:56.220 --> 15:59.090
OUR NEWFOUND ABILITY
TO EXPRESS LOVE FOR EACH OTHER.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.920
I'M TAKING YOU OUT FOR
FROSTY CHOCOLATE MILK SHAKES.

16:01.990 --> 16:02.930
YAY!

16:05.390 --> 16:08.960
THERE GO MY
YOUNG-GIRL-DREAMS OF VASSAR.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.900
HELLO, I'M DR. MARVIN MONROE.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.940
NO DOUBT YOU RECOGNIZE ME
FROM TV.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.240
WE WOULD IF WE HAD ONE.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.270
LISA!

16:15.340 --> 16:16.740
DON'T STIFLE
THE YOUNGSTER.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.030
YOUR FAMILY
MUST FEEL FREE

16:19.110 --> 16:20.210
TO EXPRESS ITSELF.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.780
THAT'S WHAT THESE PADS
AND MARKERS ARE FOR.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.340
I WANT YOU TO DRAW
YOUR FEARS, YOUR ANXIETIES--

16:26.410 --> 16:29.010
THE ROOTS OF
YOUR UNHAPPINESS.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.910
TAKE A DEEP, CLEANSING BREATH.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.160
AND BEGIN.

16:38.060 --> 16:41.700
( <i>Homer humming
"Wild Blue Yonder" )</i>

16:41.760 --> 16:44.290
Dr. Monroe:
NO SURPRISES HERE.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.840
HOMER?

16:45.900 --> 16:47.540
( <i>humming )</i>

16:47.600 --> 16:49.140
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR US?

16:53.110 --> 16:54.610
HOMER?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.350
SORRY, I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.680
IF YOU HAD BEEN
PAYING ATTENTION

16:58.750 --> 17:00.420
PERHAPS YOU
WOULD HAVE NOTICED

17:00.480 --> 17:03.750
THAT YOUR FAMILY SEES YOU
AS A STERN AUTHORITY FIGURE.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.589
AN OGRE, IF YOU WILL.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.849
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.859
"OGRE" IS A STRONG WORD.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.349
RIGHT ON, DOC.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.859
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL DIAGNOSIS.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.760
THAT DOES IT!

17:13.829 --> 17:16.430
OKAY, YOU WANT
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.000
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S HEALTHY.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.400
THERE'S NOTHING
NECESSARILY WRONG

17:19.470 --> 17:21.109
WITH HOSTILE CONFLICT.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.369
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU USE
MY PATENTED

17:24.440 --> 17:26.010
AGGRESSION THERAPY MALLETS.

17:26.069 --> 17:26.970
GOOD IDEA.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.050
ALL RIGHT.

17:28.109 --> 17:29.510
I DON'T KNOW.

17:29.580 --> 17:32.520
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER
DEEP, CLEANSING BREATH.

17:35.450 --> 17:37.650
( <i>all grunting )</i>

17:44.390 --> 17:45.700
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.760
THESE MALLET THINGS
ARE PADDED WITH FOAM RUBBER.

17:47.830 --> 17:49.400
WHAT'S THE POINT?

17:49.460 --> 17:51.460
THEY'D WORK BETTER
WITHOUT THE PADDING, DOC.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.030
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.510
SEE?
GIMME THAT!

17:55.570 --> 17:56.970
YES, WELL.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.440
THAT CONCLUDES
THIS PORTION OF OUR TREATMENT.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.440
ARE WE CURED YET?

18:00.510 --> 18:01.880
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

18:01.940 --> 18:03.400
YOU WILL BE CURED

18:03.480 --> 18:06.980
BUT IT WILL REQUIRE SOMEWHAT
MORE UNORTHODOX METHODS.

18:07.050 --> 18:08.650
UNORTHO-WHAT?

18:08.720 --> 18:11.420
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO EXPLAIN

18:11.490 --> 18:13.890
WHILE I WARM UP
THE.. ELECTRIC GENERATOR.

18:15.420 --> 18:16.620
EVERYONE COMFY?

18:16.690 --> 18:18.630
GOOD. NOW...

18:18.690 --> 18:21.820
DON'T TOUCH ANY OF THOSE
BUTTONS IN FRONT OF YOU
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT REASON.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.100
I.E...
YOU ARE WIRED INTO
THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.340
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
TO SHOCK THEM

18:28.400 --> 18:30.060
AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY
TO SHOCK...

18:30.140 --> 18:30.670
( <i>screams )</i>

18:30.740 --> 18:31.410
JUST TESTING.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.370
WHY, YOU!

18:32.440 --> 18:34.510
HOMER.
NOT YET!

18:34.580 --> 18:36.810
THIS IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS
AVERSION THERAPY.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.780
WHEN SOMEONE
HURTS YOU EMOTIONALLY

18:38.850 --> 18:40.720
YOU WILL HURT THEM
PHYSICALLY.

18:40.780 --> 18:44.350
GRADUALLY, YOU WILL LEARN
NOT TO HURT EACH OTHER AT ALL.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.760
WON'T THAT BE
WONDERFUL, HOMER?

18:46.820 --> 18:49.130
OH, YES, DOCTOR.

18:49.190 --> 18:50.290
WHOA!

18:50.360 --> 18:51.760
OW!

18:51.830 --> 18:53.530
HOW COULD YOU SHOCK YOUR
LITTLE SISTER?

18:53.590 --> 18:55.760
MY FINGER SLIPPED.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.370
SO DID MINE.

18:59.070 --> 19:00.840
BART, LISA, STOP THAT.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.240
Dr. Monroe:
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:08.810 --> 19:10.010
FOLKS?

19:11.210 --> 19:13.110
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO GET HEALTHY!

19:18.250 --> 19:19.680
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

19:19.750 --> 19:21.150
STOP! STOP!!

19:21.220 --> 19:22.920
PEOPLE, PLEASE?!

19:27.430 --> 19:30.330
Smithers:
BOY, SOMEONE'S REALLY
GOBBLING UP THE JUICE, SIR.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.770
EXCELLENT.

19:32.830 --> 19:34.490
PERHAPS THIS ENERGY
CONSERVATION FAD

19:34.570 --> 19:36.470
IS AS DEAD
AS THE DODO.

19:42.710 --> 19:43.850
DR. MONROE!

19:43.910 --> 19:46.350
YOUR OTHER PATIENTS
HAVE FLED THE BUILDING!

19:46.410 --> 19:48.110
STOP! YOU'RE DAMAGING
THE EQUIPMENT!

19:55.320 --> 19:56.620
HEY, NICE HAIR, MOM.

19:56.690 --> 19:59.060
I THOUGHT WE WERE MAKING
REAL PROGRESS.

19:59.130 --> 20:00.630
NO, I'M SORRY.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.900
YOU'RE NOT.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.220
PLEASE.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.770
WAIT A MINUTE, DOC.

20:04.830 --> 20:08.330
YOUR TV COMMERCIAL SAID
FAMILY BLISS

20:08.400 --> 20:09.730
OR DOUBLE
OUR MONEY BACK.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.670
BUT THAT WAS JUST...

20:12.740 --> 20:13.980
ALL RIGHT.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.180
GET THE MONEY.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.470
20, 40, 60, 80-- ONE.
20, 40, 60, 80-- TWO.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.720
20, 40, 60, 80-- THREE.
20, 40, 60, 80-- FOUR.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.510
20, 40 60, 80-- 500.

20:23.580 --> 20:26.210
JUST GO, AND NEVER TELL ANYONE
YOU WERE HERE.

20:26.290 --> 20:28.460
WOW! 500 SMACKERS.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.480
HOW WONDERFUL.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.500
OUR FIRST
PLEASANT SURPRISE.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.800
IT'S NOT THE MONEY AS MUCH AS
THE FEELING THAT WE EARNED IT.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.260
YOU DID IT, DAD.

20:38.330 --> 20:39.790
EXCUSE ME, DEAR.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.610
SHOULDN'T WE BE HEADING
TO THE PAWN SHOP

20:41.670 --> 20:43.110
TO GET OUR TV BACK?

20:43.170 --> 20:45.980
THAT PIECE OF JUNK?
FORGET IT.

20:46.040 --> 20:49.150
WE'LL GET A NEW TV,
21-INCH SCREEN.

20:49.210 --> 20:50.950
REALISTIC
FLESH TONES.

20:51.010 --> 20:52.550
AND A LITTLE CART

20:52.610 --> 20:54.980
SO WE CAN WHEEL IT
INTO THE DINING ROOM ON
HOLIDAYS.

20:55.050 --> 20:56.250
All:
YAY!

20:56.320 --> 20:59.060
OH, HOMER,
WE LOVE YOU.
