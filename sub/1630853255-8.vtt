'm under a lot of pressure.I

00:08.176 --> 00:09.810
'm gonna do whatever it takes.I

00:23.324 --> 00:25.326

00:32.133 --> 00:34.168
(gunshot)

00:36.304 --> 00:38.972
RAE:
This everything
you thought it'd be?

00:39.006 --> 00:40.341
Closest thing
I could find stateside.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.143
I was surprised
when you didn't re-up.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.777
What happened

00:43.811 --> 00:46.147
in Mosul...

00:46.147 --> 00:47.948
that wasn't you.

00:47.981 --> 00:48.949
Who the hell?

00:48.982 --> 00:50.351
Take the baby, Scott!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.320
(glass shatters)

00:52.353 --> 00:54.355
(both grunting)

00:56.690 --> 00:58.159
SCOTT:
I've called the police!
I've called the police!

00:58.192 --> 01:00.128
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

01:00.161 --> 01:01.495
Here's your mercy.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.497
(baby crying)

01:03.497 --> 01:06.167
My boy.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.635
(baby coos)

01:07.668 --> 01:10.003
They just spoke to some
of the brothers up in Oakland.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.205
The fuckers who rolled up--

01:11.239 --> 01:12.373
they weren't wearing kuttes,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.675
but they were recognized
as SOA

01:15.876 --> 01:17.211
One of the clubhouses
got shot up.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.646
Someone I know died.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.681
The fucking Mayans started
this shit.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.650
Terry's just doing
what he has to.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.186
We walk in,
they don't see us coming.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.854
We find Packer,
Chibs and the rest,

01:26.887 --> 01:28.088
and we shoot as many
as we fucking can.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.825
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:31.859 --> 01:33.527
(clamoring)

01:33.561 --> 01:34.428
Stop!

01:36.364 --> 01:37.565
(grunts)

01:37.598 --> 01:39.567
-We got to go now!
-GABRIELA: EZ?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.335
I'm going to tell the police.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.936
You can't. It's Angel.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.340
Your mother would want you to do

01:46.374 --> 01:47.741
-the right thing.
-(gunshot)

01:47.775 --> 01:49.042
What did you do?!

01:49.076 --> 01:50.844
EZ, what the fuck did you do?!

01:50.878 --> 01:52.079
EZ!

01:57.585 --> 02:00.721
* Little one got
to heed my warning *

02:00.721 --> 02:04.091
* Devil is fine *

02:04.124 --> 02:08.229
* I can't do him no wrong *

02:08.262 --> 02:10.698
-(car horn honks)
-* Devil is fine *
-* Oh *

02:10.731 --> 02:14.202
* Little one better
find your way out *

02:14.235 --> 02:17.405
-* Devil is kind *
-* Oh *

02:17.438 --> 02:20.774
* Little one better run
for your life *

02:20.808 --> 02:23.377
* Devil is fine *

02:23.411 --> 02:27.581
* Oh, little one gotta heed
my warning *

02:27.615 --> 02:31.084
* Devil is kind *

02:31.118 --> 02:34.087
* He come in early morning *

02:34.087 --> 02:37.758
* Devil is fine. *

02:37.758 --> 02:39.760

02:45.599 --> 02:47.601

of an Honorable Man" playing)

03:30.378 --> 03:32.380

04:01.074 --> 04:03.143
Good morning, Ezekiel.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.178
(gasps, panting)

04:10.584 --> 04:12.586
(grunts)

04:30.704 --> 04:33.874
ANGEL:
Three, two, one.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.242
Take off!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
(whooshing)

04:44.051 --> 04:46.053
(sputtering)

04:48.556 --> 04:50.558
(toy squeaking)

04:52.460 --> 04:54.061
(chuckles)

04:54.094 --> 04:55.929
-(baby babbling)
-Oh!

04:55.963 --> 04:57.865
Oh!

04:57.898 --> 05:00.267
Oh, you're so good, yeah.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.235
He needs to eat, Angel.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.240
(speaks Spanish)

05:07.274 --> 05:09.276
(baby fussing)

05:24.091 --> 05:25.759
I'll just make
some more formula.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.928
No.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.605
He's not latching because your
oxytocin levels probably ain't

05:37.605 --> 05:40.608
high enough to lactate anymore.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.310
I've been reading those.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.085
I'm his mother.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.754
I know. It's just,
you probably just been too...

05:53.787 --> 05:54.955
Ah...

05:56.123 --> 05:58.459
I'm his mother.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.135
I'm his mother.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.439
(door opens)

06:11.472 --> 06:13.474
(sighing)

06:21.882 --> 06:24.151
This is it.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.319
(exhales)

06:26.319 --> 06:28.989
You guys are just gonna be
staying over here.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.502
(clears throat)

06:41.502 --> 06:43.336
I-I, uh...

06:43.370 --> 06:45.706
made some room
for you in the closet.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.308
Um, where are you gonna...?

06:48.341 --> 06:50.010
Couch. I'm good.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.512
We'll, we'll be out
of your hair soon.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.013
Just want to give Paul
some space and--

06:53.013 --> 06:54.482
Stay as long as you like.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.049
It's cool.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.384
You like the Dodgers?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.525
This one's signed by El Toro.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.896
Fernando Valenzuela?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.931
When are we going home?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.702
Soon, baby.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.371
Soon.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.054
Son.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.224
It's good to see you.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.700
I wanted to tell you and Angel

07:46.734 --> 07:49.236
about the shop, but...
(chuckles)

07:50.604 --> 07:53.406
It's time to let the ghosts go.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.442
Move on.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.454
I spent my whole life
listening to you.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.326
Believing something was
wrong with me.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.933
Allowed you to try
to make me something else.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.110
(sighs deeply)

08:30.110 --> 08:32.312
But Goya, the painting.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.652
(sighs)
I see it now.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.324
I'm not the dog drowning.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.969
I'm the ocean.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.340
What happened, son?

09:06.847 --> 09:09.016
Gaby.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.786
What about her?

09:12.820 --> 09:15.155
You couldn't save her.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.727
What are you talking about?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.334
Where is she?

09:30.337 --> 09:32.640
Buried.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.142
Under dirt and branches.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.177
What did you do?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.180
I know who I am now.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.184
EZ?

09:46.219 --> 09:49.089
What the fuck did you do?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.693
You couldn't save me.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.876
I'm glad your mother's
not here to see you.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.220
(exhales)

10:20.220 --> 10:21.922
(sniffles)

10:21.955 --> 10:24.224
Me, too.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.127
(door closes)

10:29.930 --> 10:31.932
(sobbing)

10:50.283 --> 10:52.285
(sniffling)

10:53.320 --> 10:55.322
(sobbing)

11:18.511 --> 11:20.613
The violence.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.083
The war that's playing out
in the street right now.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.118
It ends today.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.622
The only way we stop more
bloodshed in the street

11:29.622 --> 11:32.826
is by wiping San Bernardino
off the face of the earth.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.595
Send that message to Charming.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.330
You come after ours?

11:37.364 --> 11:39.299
We'll bring death
to your doorstep.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.602
I know some of us have families.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.805
What we're asking of you today,

11:44.805 --> 11:46.506
I don't take lightly.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.310
But like every nation,

11:50.343 --> 11:52.645
for our people to be safe,
for there to be peace...

11:54.181 --> 11:56.316
...we must annihilate
our enemies.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.991
I thank you.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.393
You be careful out there, huh?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.696
(bangs gavel)

12:20.841 --> 12:22.843
(low, indistinct chatter)

12:34.421 --> 12:36.423
Padrino?

12:37.724 --> 12:39.726
Today...

12:41.194 --> 12:42.896
...sit this one out.

12:45.732 --> 12:48.335
My men go to war,

12:48.368 --> 12:50.537
I go with them.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.873
DONDO:
We can't afford
to take the risk.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.708
There ain't no club without you.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.746
I'll ride with Santo Padre.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.716
I'll make sure they don't
fuck this one up.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.294
Marcus.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.564
We're old men.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.532
We had ours.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.568
This is their war.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.370
Their time.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.905
Let 'em have it.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.742
Let 'em earn it.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.923
Hey.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.127
Hey.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.599
Are you avoiding me?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.802
Nah, uh...

13:57.337 --> 13:59.306
I just been, um...

13:59.339 --> 14:01.975
She was gonna
turn you in, Angel.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.477
-I didn't have a choice.
-I know!

14:06.813 --> 14:08.815
(exhales)

14:08.848 --> 14:10.850
Bro, it's just...

14:12.619 --> 14:14.321
It's fucked-up.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.356
You don't think
I fucking know that?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.004
You don't think I know that?

14:40.180 --> 14:42.182
I'm sorry.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.154
I'm sorry...

14:48.989 --> 14:50.991
I'm sorry you had to do that.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.533
-Bro, I just...
-Hey, hey, yo.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.302
No.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.037
Hey.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.572
I know.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.678
I know, bro.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.527
You sure you're up for today?

15:27.527 --> 15:29.329
(scoffs)

15:29.362 --> 15:31.364
It's all shifted now.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
Wave's rolling.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.577
Nothing's gonna stop it.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.883
(indistinct chatter)

16:08.901 --> 16:11.071
MAN:
Do you know

16:11.104 --> 16:13.640
if she's worked today?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.410
I think she's about
to start her shift.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.081
Sara?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.790
*

17:02.021 --> 17:04.023
*

17:52.505 --> 17:54.507
*

18:03.750 --> 18:05.852
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

18:27.740 --> 18:31.043
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

18:37.584 --> 18:39.586
(water running)

19:03.910 --> 19:05.912
*

19:28.668 --> 19:30.670
*

19:44.851 --> 19:46.919
(grunting)

19:46.953 --> 19:48.821
-What the fuck, Jaz?
-They shot him!

19:48.855 --> 19:50.290
They fucking shot Terry.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.958
And now he's in the fucking ICU

19:51.991 --> 19:53.626
hooked up to machines.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.296
You knew they were coming,
and you didn't tell us.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.964
You didn't fucking tell us!

19:57.997 --> 19:59.999
I didn't know, I swear!

20:01.133 --> 20:02.802
I swear...

20:02.835 --> 20:04.771
Fuck!

20:04.804 --> 20:06.539
(groans)

20:10.510 --> 20:12.312
Look, Terry's sponsor
is back now.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.946
And...

20:13.980 --> 20:16.182
he's fucking scary, Jess.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.118
-Terry's sober?
-No, you fucking idiot.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.321
His club sponsor, okay?

20:21.321 --> 20:23.823
He's...

20:23.856 --> 20:25.858
Even Terry's terrified of him.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.698
It's bad.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.373
All of this is so fucking bad.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.581
Leave Terry, Jaz.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.651
He cheats on you.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.853
Treats you like shit.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.222
He's my soulmate,
you fucking asshole.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.529
What are they planning next?

21:02.529 --> 21:04.697
What do you know?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.740
Fucking tell me.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.908
On our blood,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.944
tell me.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.847
Nothing.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.882
I swear.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.087
If you're lying to me,
I'm gonna tell them.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.390
I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna tell the Mayans

21:30.390 --> 21:32.892
what you did.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.896
You're gonna make it up to us.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.931
To me.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.435
You fucking owe us.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.904
You're gonna do
whatever the fuck we say.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.749
(wind chimes ringing)

22:13.132 --> 22:15.134
(bells chiming)

22:20.940 --> 22:23.643
WOMAN:
Aw, she's growing so fast.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.311
Yep.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.079
Already crawling.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.615
Daughter can't keep up.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.983
Chasing her around the house.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.585
She's a handful.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.621
Wonder where she gets that from.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.656
(chuckles)

22:41.027 --> 22:42.795
Oh, fuck.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.296
* I'm gonna live forever *

22:44.330 --> 22:46.298
* I'm gonna cross that river *

22:46.332 --> 22:49.268
* I'm gonna catch tomorrow now *

22:49.301 --> 22:50.803
(moaning)

22:50.803 --> 22:52.972
* You're gonna want to hold me *

22:52.972 --> 22:55.642
* Just like I always told you *

22:55.675 --> 22:56.643
-What the fuck?!
-(screams)

22:56.643 --> 22:57.977
* You're gonna miss me *

22:58.010 --> 22:59.479
* When I'm gone *

22:59.512 --> 23:03.483
* Nobody here
will ever find me *

23:05.051 --> 23:07.987
-Fuck.
-* But I will always be around *

23:09.321 --> 23:12.358
* Just like the songs
I leave behind me *

23:13.726 --> 23:16.328
* I'm gonna live forever now *

23:17.997 --> 23:19.566
She's beautiful, huh?

23:26.673 --> 23:29.809
* You fathers and you mothers *

23:29.842 --> 23:31.978
* Be good to one another *

23:32.011 --> 23:34.013
* Please try to raise
your children right *

23:34.013 --> 23:35.882
(sirens wailing)

23:35.915 --> 23:38.350
* Don't let
the darkness take 'em *

23:38.384 --> 23:40.687
* Don't make 'em feel forsaken *

23:40.720 --> 23:44.757
* Just lead 'em safely
to the light *

23:45.858 --> 23:49.228
* When this old world is
blown asunder *

23:49.261 --> 23:52.765
* And all the stars
fall from the sky *

23:54.534 --> 23:59.005
* Remember someone
really loves you *

23:59.038 --> 24:01.908
* We'll live forever,
you and I *

24:03.576 --> 24:06.178
* I'm gonna live forever *

24:06.212 --> 24:08.047
* I'm gonna cross that river *

24:08.080 --> 24:11.217
* I'm gonna catch tomorrow now *

24:13.052 --> 24:15.054
* I'm gonna live forever *

24:15.054 --> 24:16.923
* I'm gonna cross that river *

24:16.956 --> 24:19.792
* I'm gonna catch tomorrow now *

24:39.411 --> 24:43.082
* I'm gonna live forever,
I'm gonna cross... *

24:43.115 --> 24:45.051
If you even fucking flinch...

24:45.084 --> 24:47.286
* I'm gonna catch tomorrow now *

24:49.756 --> 24:52.258
Got my cigarettes, prospect?

24:55.962 --> 24:58.097
* I'm gonna live forever *

24:58.130 --> 24:59.899
* I'm gonna cross that river *

24:59.932 --> 25:03.469
* I'm gonna catch tomorrow now *

25:18.785 --> 25:21.287
I said hard pack, motherfucker.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.257
(whistles)

25:25.291 --> 25:26.926
* I'm gonna cross that river *

25:26.959 --> 25:29.629
* I'm gonna catch
tomorrow now. *

25:36.335 --> 25:38.337
(power tools whirring nearby)

25:47.714 --> 25:49.315
They're in the ba...

25:49.348 --> 25:51.884
(overlapping shouting)

25:52.551 --> 25:53.820
(gunfire)

25:55.021 --> 25:56.823
-Let's go!
-Shit.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.659
-(gunfire)
-(overlapping shouting)

26:12.705 --> 26:14.173
Come on.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.210
-Let's go, let's go.
-(groaning)

26:22.514 --> 26:24.216
(bullets ricocheting)

26:24.250 --> 26:26.518
I got this.

26:28.554 --> 26:31.190
-(gunfire)
-(overlapping shouting)

26:32.191 --> 26:33.359
-Let's go!
-Come on.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.195
(gunfire)

26:36.195 --> 26:38.564
What the fuck?!

26:45.237 --> 26:47.239
Come on.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.543
Go!

26:52.544 --> 26:54.546
*

27:05.557 --> 27:07.093
-(gunfire)
-(screaming)

27:09.729 --> 27:11.731
Hey, get down!

27:11.731 --> 27:13.565
Get on your fucking knees now!

27:14.566 --> 27:16.068
Get the fuck down!

27:17.069 --> 27:19.638
Hey, hey.
Stay with me, brother.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.910
(gunfire)

27:31.918 --> 27:34.320
(grunting)

27:37.623 --> 27:39.591
(chuckles)

27:39.625 --> 27:41.093
(gunshot)

27:54.640 --> 27:56.642
(men grunting)

28:04.616 --> 28:06.618
You cool?

28:07.987 --> 28:09.989
Yeah.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.764
Get it off.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.999
Get that shit off.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.008
ANGEL:
Stop moving.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.442
Get the fuck up, let's go!

28:30.476 --> 28:31.944
-Let's go, get up.
-Get off me.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.146
(quiet muttering)

28:34.180 --> 28:37.483
ANGEL:
Hey, get your ass over there,
get down!

28:37.483 --> 28:39.618
Let's go, get up.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.653
(indistinct chatter)

28:54.867 --> 28:56.869
You okay?

28:59.038 --> 29:01.173
Poor fucker.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.075
EZ:
Canche.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.744
I caught you slipping.

29:27.867 --> 29:31.237
(muffled chatter)

29:36.042 --> 29:38.044
(grunts)

29:41.280 --> 29:43.282
(pounding on door)

29:47.119 --> 29:49.121
(punk music playing)

29:55.227 --> 29:57.229
(indistinct chatter)

30:22.088 --> 30:23.422
Canche.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.092
I'm sorry.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.429
Shit happens, you know?

30:34.300 --> 30:35.401
(chuckles softly)

30:35.434 --> 30:37.769
I remember this one time...

30:41.140 --> 30:43.775
I know y'all might not have seen
eye to eye, but...

30:43.809 --> 30:45.744
he was a good man.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.279
He was a good big brother to me.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.648
(grunts)

30:51.017 --> 30:53.319
All this, man,

30:53.352 --> 30:56.788
just to end up a fucking bullet
on a table once a year.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.158
Bunch of drunk dudes
sitting around,

30:59.191 --> 31:01.127
talking about your character.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.997
He was a dad, man.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.798
He had a little boy.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.302
But I know you know that, huh?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.179
If you'll excuse me, bro,
I think I lost my appetite

31:20.212 --> 31:21.647
for this shit tonight.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.983
Otero will become president.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.622
You should move
to become Yuma VP.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.358
Oh, yeah?

31:32.391 --> 31:34.526
It's physics.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.500
(indistinct chatter)

31:49.675 --> 31:51.677
(sighs)

31:56.048 --> 31:57.516
(grunts)

32:00.719 --> 32:02.354
Today...

32:02.354 --> 32:04.523
You would've done
the same thing.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.527
I would've stood there,

32:08.527 --> 32:10.896
watched him put a bullet
in your head.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.402
So that night, in there...

32:17.903 --> 32:20.539
...you had your chance
to stand back, do nothing.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.108
But you didn't.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.543
Look, I'm not saying
we're all...

32:24.543 --> 32:26.745
I'm not asking
for us to be good.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.880
But I'm telling you
what we are...

32:28.880 --> 32:29.881
is square.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.622
I don't owe you anything
anymore.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.071
(door closes)

32:56.408 --> 32:57.409
(music stops)

33:19.765 --> 33:21.800
You've inherited a path

33:21.833 --> 33:23.469
that has taken
a lot of brothers.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.439
And today
we lost another good one.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.808
So, tonight, when you drink,

33:29.841 --> 33:31.277
you drink to him.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.245
Salud.

33:33.279 --> 33:34.446
OTHERS:
Salud.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.615
DIAZ:
As Mayans,

33:36.615 --> 33:39.118
we don't mourn our soldiers.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.287
We celebrate them.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.588
To Canche.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.423
OTHERS:
To Canche.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.458
(glasses slamming)

33:47.793 --> 33:49.961
(chatter resumes)

33:49.961 --> 33:51.163
(music restarts)

33:57.969 --> 33:59.971
(baby crying)

34:19.325 --> 34:21.327
(crying stops)

34:48.520 --> 34:50.856
Right there.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.391
Right... there.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.892
Yep. Yep.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.227
Almost there.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.862
Almost. Uh...

34:56.895 --> 34:58.997
(chuckling)

34:59.030 --> 35:00.699
Oh. Okay. I'll get it for you.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.034
-I'll get it for you.
-(fussing softly)

35:03.068 --> 35:04.336
Um...

35:04.370 --> 35:05.737
Hmm?

35:07.038 --> 35:09.575
Okay?
(kiss)

35:09.608 --> 35:12.544
-(fussing)
-You look exhausted.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.114
Oh, I can't.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.117
(breathing heavily)

35:25.957 --> 35:29.595
I'm scared
they've done so many...

35:29.628 --> 35:32.598
bad things to me
that now I'm...

35:32.631 --> 35:34.600
-(fusses)
-You're his mother.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.602
(shuddering)

35:36.635 --> 35:39.438
I'm a monster, Angel.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.473
(sniffling)

35:43.909 --> 35:45.911
I did to him

35:45.911 --> 35:48.780
the same thing
those monsters did to me.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.949
I made him see

35:50.982 --> 35:53.051
what I saw as a child.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.553
(shuddering)

35:54.586 --> 35:56.222
His family.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.457
We're his family.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.625
I...

35:59.658 --> 36:03.795
(crying): I broke in him
what's broken in me.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.802
(sniffles, inhales deeply)

36:10.836 --> 36:13.171
-(baby cooing)
-(breathing heavily)

36:15.507 --> 36:17.909
There's so much bad out there.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.945
(suckling, cooing)

36:21.613 --> 36:23.282
Maybe...

36:24.783 --> 36:26.952
Maybe we're both fucked-up.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.119
(sniffles)

36:29.288 --> 36:31.290
But he's good.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.459
He's...

36:33.492 --> 36:34.993
pure.

36:38.163 --> 36:41.300
Now it's our job
to protect that.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.469
Not let him...

36:43.469 --> 36:46.972
end up broken like us.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.307
(baby coos)

36:48.307 --> 36:50.141
I love you, Luisa.

36:50.141 --> 36:51.343
But if you leave again...

36:51.377 --> 36:53.812
(baby suckling)

36:53.812 --> 36:55.481
...he stays.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.155
Our baby stays.

37:04.155 --> 37:06.658
(sighs)

37:11.663 --> 37:13.131
(Rae sighs)

37:13.164 --> 37:15.367
RAE (muffled):
He's in bed.

37:15.401 --> 37:16.835
Want a beer?

37:16.835 --> 37:18.203
Hey.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.905
Earth to Lopez.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.174
Yeah, sorry.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.876
(chuckles)

37:24.910 --> 37:26.412
(grunts)

37:29.247 --> 37:30.649
Don't be sorry.

37:30.682 --> 37:31.750
It's your house.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.688
How was your day?

37:38.357 --> 37:39.858
Good.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.560
Chill.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.762
(sighs)
Just hung out with the fellas.

37:45.697 --> 37:46.832
How's he doing?

37:46.865 --> 37:48.434
(chuckles)

37:51.036 --> 37:53.038
Loves his dad more
than anything.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.208
It's tough.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.080
(sighs)
I just need Paul to...

38:07.386 --> 38:09.220
(exhales)

38:11.957 --> 38:13.625
How do you do it?

38:16.294 --> 38:18.063
You have your shit so together.

38:19.230 --> 38:20.899
How'd you leave it all
over there?

38:22.401 --> 38:23.735
(exhales)

38:25.404 --> 38:27.906
We just did our job,
then we came home.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.609
(scoffs softly)

38:31.610 --> 38:32.578
Yeah.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.312
(chuckles)

38:37.749 --> 38:39.585
It's a gift.

38:39.585 --> 38:40.752
You know?

38:41.753 --> 38:44.255
Way you've always seen the world
so black and white.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.595
I get so...

38:50.596 --> 38:51.963
...angry.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.503
I don't get to be fucked-up.

39:00.472 --> 39:03.942
I have to keep my shit together
for Jacob.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.179
But I saw all the same things.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.450
Mosul...

39:11.483 --> 39:12.918
was on me.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.185
Don't say that.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.622
(grunts)

39:16.622 --> 39:18.156
It's not true.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.293
Ultimately, I made the call.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.531
I was your commanding officer.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.434
Anything that happened,

39:28.467 --> 39:30.636
everything that did happen...

39:33.138 --> 39:34.473
...it's on me.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.675
Does he think
it doesn't haunt me?

39:43.649 --> 39:46.117
That I don't see that...
(sobs)

39:46.151 --> 39:48.820
little girl's face, too?

39:49.821 --> 39:51.189
Her mother?

39:53.525 --> 39:54.993
Her grandmother?

39:58.530 --> 40:00.666
You know...

40:00.699 --> 40:02.333
if that first car had just...

40:02.333 --> 40:04.002
-(grunts)
-(clatters loudly)

40:04.002 --> 40:05.671
(dog barking in distance)

40:09.508 --> 40:10.809
JACOB:
Mom?

40:10.842 --> 40:12.844
You okay, sweetie?

40:12.878 --> 40:14.379
(sniffles)
Everything's okay.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.850
(sighs)
Yeah, little man.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.852
Everything's okay.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.024
It's just...

40:26.024 --> 40:27.759
it's been a long day.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.028
We've had a...

40:30.061 --> 40:31.897
long day, too.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.033
Let's go, baby.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.568
Okay.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.544
(sniffles)

40:51.717 --> 40:53.719
(indistinct chatter)

40:56.421 --> 40:58.724
That's intense.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.559
Uber driver asked me,
like, five times

41:00.559 --> 41:02.260
if I was sure
this was the right place.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.229
(both chuckle)

41:04.229 --> 41:06.231
It's definitely the wrong place.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.099
(both chuckle)

41:09.134 --> 41:10.802
But that,
that's just for security.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.905
There's no safer place to be.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.208
I'm nervous.

41:17.242 --> 41:19.410
Meeting the family
is a big step.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.581
They're gonna love you.

41:26.652 --> 41:28.086
Come on.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.493
(indistinct chatter)

41:43.602 --> 41:44.936
Who do we have the pleasure?

41:44.970 --> 41:46.738
This is Kody.

41:46.772 --> 41:48.273
Hello, Miss Kody.

41:48.306 --> 41:50.108
Damn. "Miss Kody"?

41:50.141 --> 41:51.743
What am I,
a kindergarten teacher?

41:51.777 --> 41:52.778
-Fuck. (chuckles)
-(laughter)

41:54.445 --> 41:56.081
Have a seat, sweetheart.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.482
Thank you.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.619
Hi. I'm Dondo.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.287
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.321
I'm Hank.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.856
Hank.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.760
I can already tell
she's too good for you.

42:08.794 --> 42:10.796
-Hmm! Ah.
-(laughter)

42:10.796 --> 42:12.330
I like him.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.666
BISHOP:
Wow, look at this dude.

42:17.803 --> 42:19.137
Come here.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.139
Come here.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.979
After today,

42:27.979 --> 42:30.649
you might still be a prospect,
but you ain't no bitch.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.021
Thanks, man.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.689
Fuck your thanks.

42:37.723 --> 42:39.324
Get me a drink, prospect.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.358
-Hmm?
-(slams table)

42:40.391 --> 42:42.193
Now.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.195
Snap it up.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.496
Fucking emotional.

42:45.496 --> 42:47.198
Fuck.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.533

42:49.735 --> 42:51.837

42:53.872 --> 42:56.074
(footsteps approaching)

43:00.746 --> 43:02.380
(exhales)

43:13.224 --> 43:15.526
That's very rare.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.028
Please put it down.

43:17.028 --> 43:18.063

43:18.096 --> 43:19.564
(exhales)

43:19.597 --> 43:21.032
(chuckles)

43:34.545 --> 43:36.214
(inhales deeply)
For too long

43:36.247 --> 43:40.385
I have adhered
to this insane arrangement.

43:40.385 --> 43:44.022
To think that s-someone like you

43:44.055 --> 43:47.192
telling someone like me
what to do.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.394
(laughs)

43:49.427 --> 43:50.896
But no more.

43:52.097 --> 43:54.700
Our mom wasn't the only thing
that...

43:54.733 --> 43:55.867
died today.

43:55.901 --> 43:57.568
If you were going
to show up drunk,

43:57.602 --> 43:58.904
-you shouldn't have bothered.
-Shut up!

43:58.937 --> 44:01.907
Shut the fuck up
for once in your life!

44:01.940 --> 44:04.409
Things are gonna change here.
(pants)

44:04.409 --> 44:06.111
I'm through with this...

44:06.144 --> 44:07.412
-pathetic charade.
-This is

44:07.445 --> 44:08.279
how Father wanted it.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.649
(exhales sharply)
Dad's dead.

44:12.751 --> 44:14.419
Mom is dead.

44:14.419 --> 44:17.122
The old ways are dead.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.959
(breathing heavily)

44:20.992 --> 44:23.261
I'm in charge now.

44:36.274 --> 44:38.109
I may let you live.

44:39.778 --> 44:40.946
Here.

44:41.947 --> 44:44.115
Amongst all the ghosts.

44:49.487 --> 44:52.958
Just another... oddity,

44:52.958 --> 44:56.762
locked safely away
from public view.

44:56.795 --> 44:59.130
But the family business...

45:00.331 --> 45:02.033
...is mine.

45:24.155 --> 45:26.157
(whining softly)

45:27.558 --> 45:29.560

46:50.241 --> 46:52.243
(music playing faintly)

46:55.480 --> 46:57.215
That was pretty dope.

46:57.248 --> 46:58.216
What?

46:58.249 --> 46:59.584
My brothers.

46:59.584 --> 47:01.419
They mean the world to me.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.754
And for them to know my girl...

47:03.754 --> 47:05.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:05.490 --> 47:06.925
Am I your girl?

47:07.959 --> 47:09.594
-Your girl?
-(exhales)

47:09.627 --> 47:11.429
I told you they would love you.

47:12.763 --> 47:14.732
And...

47:14.765 --> 47:16.434
I mean, I could, like...

47:17.435 --> 47:18.803
I could maybe...

47:20.005 --> 47:21.406
I mean, at some point.

47:21.439 --> 47:23.774
I mean, I know it's too soon.

47:24.775 --> 47:26.111
I mean...

47:26.111 --> 47:27.445
Hey.

47:30.115 --> 47:31.682
Maybe me, too.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.152
One day.
