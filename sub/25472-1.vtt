01:34.344 --> 01:35.960
<i>And she asked him,</i>

01:36.680 --> 01:38.387
<i>"What will it be like?</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:40.139
<i>"The kingdom?"</i>

01:46.189 --> 01:47.396
<i>And he said,</i>

01:48.525 --> 01:50.187
<i>"It is like a seed,</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:54.191
<i>"a single grain
of mustard seed,</i>

01:57.284 --> 02:00.493
<i>"which a woman took
and sowed in her garden.</i>

02:02.956 --> 02:04.037
<i>"And it grew,</i>

02:04.124 --> 02:05.240
<i>"and it grew.</i>

02:08.127 --> 02:11.712
<i>"And the birds of the air
made nests in its branches."</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:34.666
Mary!

03:37.759 --> 03:39.045
Mary!

03:53.483 --> 03:54.473
Mary.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.103
Mary! You have to tell her.
She can't cut it out.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.358
- There's no time for this.
- You can't cut her.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.690
She needs to push.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.491
There's no point pushing.
The baby can't get through.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.944
You have to find a way.

04:06.621 --> 04:10.535
I can try and stretch her,
but she needs to stay completely still.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.741
- Oh, no.
- Shh.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.455
No, no!

04:13.545 --> 04:15.161
- Leah.
- No!

04:15.255 --> 04:16.712
- Leah.
- No!

04:17.841 --> 04:20.959
- No!
- Look at me. Leah, look at me.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.465
Look at me. Look at me.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.796
You need to lie still.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.177
- She's going to hurt me.
- Yes.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.385
Yes, she is,
but only for a moment so your baby can come.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.221
You can take it for a moment.
I know you can.

04:35.192 --> 04:39.027
Look at me. Look at me.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.733
I'll be here with you.
I won't let you go.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.660
I'm here.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.830
Can you lie still?

04:56.755 --> 04:58.667
- Yes.
- Yes.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.842
Rachel, come.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.382
Take her shoulders.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.264
Hold her strong.

05:16.358 --> 05:20.568
- Keep her leg down.
- Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.566
You're okay.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.158
Keep her still.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.950
Again.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.413
Can I hold the baby?

06:20.589 --> 06:23.502
Brother,
what a beautiful boy.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.002
Beautiful.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.718
Congratulations, Aaron.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.094
Thank you, Joseph.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.308
How is she?

06:36.646 --> 06:37.978
Mary got her through.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.686
The midwife says
she's a natural.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.227
Aren't you all?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.568
You should all
be proud of your sister.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.197
"I lift up my eyes
to the mountains."

09:03.460 --> 09:05.042
"From where
will my help come?"

09:06.171 --> 09:08.458
Ephraim will come
and dine with us tomorrow.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.165
You know him.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.049
I knew his wife.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.760
He's a good man.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.842
His children need a mother.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.758
- He's asked for you, Mary.
- You need me.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.933
It would please God
for you to be a mother.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.603
It would please me.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.757
Is Joseph going to hear
that man speak again?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.842
He's been every day this week.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.467
Must be nice to have
so much time on your hands.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.789
You're going to
be beautiful.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.012
Girls.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.971
It's a good space.
It's warm and...

10:48.565 --> 10:50.431
Our house is yours, Ephraim.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.941
Enough for the family.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.813
Here.
Put them here.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.273
Yes, that's great.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.783
It's good to welcome you here at last,
Ephraim.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.990
You have
a beautiful family, Elisha.

11:07.709 --> 11:11.043
Children, come and meet Ephraim.
Come on. Hello, Ephraim.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.086
This healer is different.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.710
I don't know.
In the things he does, the things he says.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.841
What did he talk about?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.168
A new world.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.386
A just world,
free of tyranny.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.801
A holy kingdom.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.514
I saw him heal a man
by the beacon.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.516
The one who's always
in the market, shouting.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.641
Some people have said they tried
to cast the demon out of him.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.476
Who is he, then, a prophet?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.190
He was with the Baptist.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.983
Where? At the Jordan?

11:40.325 --> 11:42.863
John the Baptist
was a true prophet.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.114
You've always said that.
That's why Herod killed him.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.491
That's enough now.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.615
Why shouldn't we
talk about it?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.543
Because we don't live in
a good age for baptists,

11:52.629 --> 11:54.086
or prophets,

11:54.172 --> 11:55.754
or gossip, for that matter.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.513
You need to make
many sons, Ephraim.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.273
May the angels
shine down on both of you.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.940
Maybe we could all travel
together for Passover.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.946
I try to visit Jerusalem
whenever I can.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.628
Mary?

12:41.219 --> 12:42.209
Where are you?

12:44.889 --> 12:45.970
Mary!

12:50.311 --> 12:52.223
- Mary!
- Mary!

13:29.767 --> 13:31.133
Mary?

13:34.022 --> 13:35.263
Mary?

13:38.818 --> 13:39.934
Mary?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.269
Tell me how to help you.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.659
Go and get her father
and Daniel!

13:59.255 --> 14:00.291
Mary?

14:04.552 --> 14:07.215
Mary, tell me
how to help you. Mary.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.633
Mary!

14:21.027 --> 14:22.313
Shame!

14:52.975 --> 14:54.841
You brought shame
on our family.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.064
What did you think
you were doing?

15:04.195 --> 15:05.561
I needed to pray.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.856
- To decide.
- "Decide"?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.613
Listen.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.742
You pray at the service
with the other women.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.616
You pray at home
with your family.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.663
But you don't just run into the
night like some wandering lunatic.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.882
I can't marry Ephraim.
I'm not made for that life.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.556
Then what on Earth
are you made for?

15:39.397 --> 15:42.856
You want me to bind your
breasts and shave your head

15:44.068 --> 15:45.684
so you can become a man?

15:50.074 --> 15:51.861
Then you can pray
whenever you want.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.415
You stain our mother's memory.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.499
This time, you will marry.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.133
You've indulged her
for too long, Father.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.659
Mary.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.249
Mary.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.506
- Get up.
- What is it?

16:49.592 --> 16:50.878
Father's waiting.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.596
We need to
show you something.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.303
Daniel.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.263
Daniel!

17:06.233 --> 17:07.349
What's happening?

17:08.236 --> 17:09.521
Go back to sleep.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.444
Where are you taking her?

17:12.906 --> 17:13.988
Daniel!

17:14.867 --> 17:15.983
Mother?

17:16.493 --> 17:17.609
Shh. It's all right.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.746
Everything
will be fine, Mary.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.222
Don't be afraid, Mary.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.351
What are you doing?

17:50.444 --> 17:52.310
There's something
unnatural inside you.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.313
Father?

17:54.448 --> 17:55.438
Leave her, and flee outside.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.819
Father?

17:56.909 --> 18:00.994
Be silent,
be silent, be silent.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.070
Stop!

18:02.164 --> 18:03.996
This is not your place.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.536
Come out, Demon,
come out, Demon.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.912
Get out!
Stay still! Stay still!

18:07.003 --> 18:08.119
Come out and depart from here.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.202
No!

18:09.297 --> 18:11.163
Leave her, and flee outside.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.546
Be silent, be silent,
silence yourself.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.671
Daniel!

18:19.765 --> 18:20.801
Leave her alone!

18:20.891 --> 18:22.348
- Father!
- Leave her!

18:32.111 --> 18:33.192
Leave her...

18:33.571 --> 18:35.733
Stop! Stop!

19:06.395 --> 19:07.431
Mary.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.731
Father.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.029
Please.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.819
Let me bring the healer.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.245
Yes.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.092
She won't talk to me.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.432
I don't know
who she is anymore.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.182
I'll see her alone.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.280
Your family says
you grapple with the demon.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.537
If there's a demon in me,
it's always been there.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.707
I wish there was a demon.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.633
Why?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.920
What is it
you fear in yourself?

21:09.351 --> 21:10.637
My thoughts.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.310
My longings, my unhappiness.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.104
I fear that I shame my family.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.357
I do shame them.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.531
I'm not as I'm supposed to be.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.329
What is it
you long for?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.216
I'm not sure.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.721
To know God.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.608
And yet you've felt
God's presence.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.457
Sometimes, in the stillness,
I think I feel it.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.708
It's always been there.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.174
All it needs is your faith.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.901
There are no demons here.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.116
Rest now.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.372
Rest in the light.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.765
Elisha is going to see
Ephraim today.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.277
He thinks the match
is still possible.

23:40.961 --> 23:41.951
Join us!

23:42.046 --> 23:43.628
- Come join us!
- Come, brother!

23:45.883 --> 23:47.215
- Mary.
- Join us!

23:47.718 --> 23:48.754
Mary!

23:58.062 --> 23:59.269
Mary!

24:06.028 --> 24:08.486
Each of you stand
at the threshold.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.822
Do you fear that you will
never reach the kingdom?

24:11.909 --> 24:13.946
Whose kingdom?
Herod's kingdom?

24:14.036 --> 24:15.493
He keeps
company with sinners.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.993
You know as well as I do there
is only one true kingdom.

24:20.834 --> 24:21.824
And that is God's.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.880
And God's kingdom
is taking root.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.299
So we must prepare.

24:31.845 --> 24:36.180
You must wash away the stains

24:36.266 --> 24:37.757
of your corruption

24:39.103 --> 24:41.060
and be born anew.

24:42.648 --> 24:43.638
Like children.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.559
I have been hidden
for too long.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.480
And now you hide.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.488
Each one of you.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.697
Behind the semblance
of your faith,

25:03.085 --> 25:05.122
you recite your songs

25:05.254 --> 25:08.213
and present your sacrifices

25:08.298 --> 25:12.087
as if your hearts and spirits,

25:12.177 --> 25:14.260
your service to God,
were what?

25:15.305 --> 25:19.219
And afterwards, you go back to your
lives and do what pleases you,

25:20.144 --> 25:22.056
what suits you,

25:22.146 --> 25:26.857
what makes the days upon this
Earth pass easily for you.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.225
Like dreamers.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.063
But wake up, Magdala.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.238
Open your eyes.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.029
Look at the people

25:41.749 --> 25:46.244
in Galilee
and Judaea suffering,

25:46.336 --> 25:50.046
crying out for help,
for mercy, for justice!

25:50.132 --> 25:52.089
Look at the crosses
on the hills of Jerusalem.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.292
Blame the Romans!

25:53.385 --> 25:55.172
Our holy city held
hostage to Roman jackals.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.719
Jerusalem is lost to us!

25:57.973 --> 25:59.339
Who will deliver us?

26:00.768 --> 26:03.135
Can your faith
be held hostage?

26:09.234 --> 26:10.350
Listen.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.695
In the silence.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.825
Is there something

26:30.047 --> 26:31.333
calling?

26:37.888 --> 26:44.055
Do you have the courage
to follow what you hear?

26:48.649 --> 26:52.609
Will you align yourselves
to the will of God

26:53.946 --> 26:56.233
until every act of love,

26:56.990 --> 27:02.031
every thought of care,
and every breath is taken in union?

27:02.996 --> 27:05.033
That is faith.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.000
And that faith

27:09.837 --> 27:14.252
will have you feed the
suffering to ease their pain.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.551
And it is that faith,

27:26.019 --> 27:28.011
your faith,

27:31.567 --> 27:33.934
which will lead you
to God's kingdom.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.573
Come. Come, Magdala.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.991
Come to the water.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.076
- Come, brother!
- Be born anew!

27:48.167 --> 27:49.248
Join us!

27:49.710 --> 27:52.919
I baptize you with water
for your repentance.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.167
Into the light of God,
born anew.

27:55.257 --> 27:59.547
By being what we are,
may we become even what he is himself.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.427
- Come. Join us!
- Come, brother.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.802
Praise God!

28:06.727 --> 28:09.435
- Be born anew.
- Join us.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.104
Come. Jesus is here.

28:12.566 --> 28:13.852
The kingdom is coming.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.059
I baptize you into repentance.
Into the light of God, born anew.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.524
Join us!
May we become even what he is himself.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.402
- Praise God!
- Come, brother!

28:22.201 --> 28:25.694
I baptize you into repentance.
Into the light of God, born anew.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.868
We have given nothing.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.832
- Look
- MAN 2: She can see!

29:14.753 --> 29:16.335
Praise God!

29:17.381 --> 29:19.293
The great prophet
is among us!

29:24.930 --> 29:26.546
He is the Baptist!

29:26.640 --> 29:28.472
The Baptist
raised from the dead!

29:29.059 --> 29:31.096
God is working
through him!

29:31.979 --> 29:33.595
- Please be patient.
- Don't push.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.346
Please, don't push.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.273
Be patient.

29:40.153 --> 29:41.189
Stay back.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.237
Please be calm.
Please be calm.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.406
- Please wait.
- Please, don't push.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.109
Move back!

29:48.704 --> 29:50.445
Please, be patient!

29:50.998 --> 29:52.284
Don't push, please.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.494
The devil's prophet!

29:58.964 --> 30:00.546
The devil's work!

30:01.341 --> 30:03.754
- The devil's prophet!
- Rejoice!

30:04.845 --> 30:07.553
For the kingdom of God
is coming!

30:07.681 --> 30:10.515
- There are too many!
- Rejoice!

30:10.600 --> 30:13.388
Come, brothers. Be born anew!

30:15.856 --> 30:17.017
Don't push.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.392
Stay calm.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.601
Peter!

30:21.695 --> 30:22.776
Peter!

30:23.572 --> 30:25.279
Don't push me.
Don't push. Stop pushing.

30:25.365 --> 30:28.073
Rabbi. Come back to us.
Come back.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.776
- Be patient.
- Don't push!

30:31.163 --> 30:33.120
Come away, woman.
Come away.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.448
Calm down.
Be patient. Don't push.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.124
Please, please, be patient.

30:39.129 --> 30:41.121
Andrew, Andrew,
hold them!

30:41.590 --> 30:42.706
Stop pushing.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.040
He is
the devil's prophet!

31:56.790 --> 31:58.531
The rabbi is leaving today.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.036
All those men
with him, Mary.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.671
You'll be lost.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.377
I'm lost here.

32:16.226 --> 32:17.558
We are your family.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.396
No man will touch you.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.480
Daniel won't
take you back in.

32:30.574 --> 32:31.610
Never.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.908
Please.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.337
I can't.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.600
Daniel!

33:01.354 --> 33:02.344
Daniel!

33:03.982 --> 33:05.098
Mary!

33:13.283 --> 33:14.273
Mary!

33:18.788 --> 33:20.120
What troubles you, sister?

33:28.131 --> 33:29.622
What have you said to her?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.421
What have you promised her?

33:35.388 --> 33:36.629
I'm her father.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.259
She belongs with me.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.008
We've asked nothing
from your daughter.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.092
Peter.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.607
Would you separate
a daughter from her father?

33:56.660 --> 33:57.992
Is that God's way?

33:59.955 --> 34:03.448
Daughters from fathers,
sons from mothers.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.375
What will you do with her?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.244
She will follow him.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.166
Just as we do.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.420
Come away, Mary.
That's far enough, brother.

34:15.512 --> 34:16.719
- I said, come away!
- Hold on.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.888
- Stay back!
- Daniel!

34:19.641 --> 34:20.722
Stay back.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.295
What's she doing?

34:59.389 --> 35:01.051
- Mary!
- Daniel, don't!

35:01.141 --> 35:02.131
- Daniel!
- Mary!

35:03.184 --> 35:04.595
- Mary, come back!
- Stop!

35:04.686 --> 35:06.552
- No!
- Calm down! Calm down!

35:06.646 --> 35:07.807
- Don't do that.
- Stop.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.479
How is this God's will?

35:10.400 --> 35:11.481
Huh?

35:12.569 --> 35:15.061
No man can decide that!
No man!

35:15.155 --> 35:16.362
Stay calm, please.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.231
I baptize you with water
to cleanse you.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.581
I baptize you with light
and with fire.

36:13.296 --> 36:16.130
I baptize you to be born anew,

36:16.216 --> 36:19.880
awake, and ready
for the day to come.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.190
She will divide
our community.

36:36.736 --> 36:37.897
We should welcome her.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.280
Why shouldn't she
follow him?

36:42.909 --> 36:44.116
People will judge us.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.383
Don't look.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.383
It's easier that way.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.320
He's talking to the angels.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.660
We will rest here tonight.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.299
Peter's little boy used to sit
at the rabbi's feet and sing.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.597
The sweetest thing.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.679
Hmm.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.436
I think it broke Peter's heart
to leave him.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.892
Do you have children?

38:42.612 --> 38:45.650
One. A girl. Esther.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.158
And where is she now?

38:49.244 --> 38:50.405
In the ground.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.993
There was a drought
in the hills where we lived.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.284
There was
hardly any grain.

38:59.796 --> 39:02.880
But Herod still sent his
agents to take their due.

39:03.550 --> 39:06.509
When I refused,
a Roman officer came,

39:06.594 --> 39:08.631
and I had to give
my entire crop.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.055
My wife was pregnant.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.018
She didn't have the strength
to fight the hunger.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.220
I'm sorry.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.317
The kingdom is coming, Mary.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.191
Soon. I can wait.

39:28.241 --> 39:30.073
I can be patient for that.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.445
When the dead,
the beloved dead,

39:34.539 --> 39:37.907
will rise up and walk
amongst us whole and well.

39:41.588 --> 39:43.454
It's been promised, Mary.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.756
In the kingdom,
I will see my family again.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.983
What happened with that
crowd was dangerous.

40:05.194 --> 40:07.231
He put himself in danger.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.484
We can't risk
that kind of riot.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.861
The angels
were working with him.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.817
You could see.
God was with him.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.244
It's the miracles.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.821
What? You question them?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.702
Of course I don't
question them, Judas.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.951
Look, we want the people to rally,
to rise up.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.537
Slowly. Slowly,
we spread the word.

40:24.631 --> 40:26.839
We strengthen
in numbers and then...

40:26.925 --> 40:28.757
When we are sure
of the support...

40:28.843 --> 40:30.084
Jerusalem.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.462
Passover.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.427
That is where it begins.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.009
I've never heard our rabbi
talk about this plan of yours.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.685
He shouldn't have to
talk about it.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.938
Because he doesn't
need to, Peter.

40:44.567 --> 40:49.483
All he needs to do is say the word,
lift his hand, and the seas will part.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.154
The Roman palaces
will crumble.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.983
And the heavens will rain down
blood on the oppressors.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.444
Look, we will draw up
a strategy, huh?

40:56.955 --> 40:58.162
An agreed strategy.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.456
But just one word of sedition
to the Romans, Peter...

41:01.542 --> 41:03.829
How many men have cried
the coming of the kingdom

41:03.920 --> 41:06.037
and found their fate
lay on the execution block?

41:06.130 --> 41:09.339
Or the cross,
if someone were to shout, "Messiah"?

41:09.425 --> 41:12.509
By then the kingdom of David
will have truly begun.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.461
I didn't know
we were to be soldiers.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.220
No, sister.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.602
We are just a group of men.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.434
Unarmed.

41:25.108 --> 41:26.974
And how many Roman guards
in Jerusalem alone...

41:27.068 --> 41:30.027
The prophet spoke of peace,
a "Prince of Peace."

41:30.154 --> 41:33.192
Perhaps those who have
not been with us long

41:34.200 --> 41:35.691
should keep their counsel, eh?

41:36.452 --> 41:38.409
Everyone should be
free to speak here.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.324
It's not
our place to judge.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.123
But we will be judged.

42:06.399 --> 42:09.016
When you were younger,
did you ever think,

42:09.902 --> 42:11.814
if you looked away
from something,

42:13.031 --> 42:15.023
that it may just disappear?

42:36.262 --> 42:37.628
I'll miss the lake.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.549
My brothers and I used to see how
long we could hold our breath

42:41.684 --> 42:42.970
under the water in the lake,

42:44.395 --> 42:46.637
how deep into the weeds
we could swim.

42:48.357 --> 42:49.598
I loved it down there.

42:51.069 --> 42:55.814
It was like I didn't need my body.
I didn't need the earth.

42:57.492 --> 43:00.985
And then I would rise up
into the air, into the light.

43:05.958 --> 43:08.291
Is that what it feels like
to be one with God?

43:10.588 --> 43:13.080
No one has ever asked me
how it feels.

43:25.645 --> 43:26.931
Are they arguing?

43:28.106 --> 43:30.143
They sounded like soldiers.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.821
- Do you want to be a soldier?
- No.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.150
Although I'm not sure
what matters to a woman

43:42.245 --> 43:43.531
is of much account here.

43:44.247 --> 43:45.328
Why do you say that?

43:46.833 --> 43:49.120
The women in Magdala,
they were too afraid.

43:51.087 --> 43:53.545
They were too afraid
to be baptized with the men.

43:55.550 --> 43:56.791
And they can't follow you.

44:03.141 --> 44:04.257
Forgive me.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.117
The synagogue is
on the other side of town.

45:55.211 --> 45:56.622
This is not
a place for men.

46:13.646 --> 46:17.230
Well, unless he intends to
wash his robes,

46:17.358 --> 46:19.395
I think he means to teach here.
Jesus.

46:19.527 --> 46:20.563
It's Jesus.

46:20.653 --> 46:22.144
Because of her?

46:48.889 --> 46:49.925
Mary.

46:50.391 --> 46:52.383
He's waiting. Look.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.147
What shall I teach?

47:09.493 --> 47:12.486
Are we so different from men you
must teach us different things?

47:12.580 --> 47:13.946
We are women.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.539
Our lives are not our own.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.669
Your spirit's your own.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.258
And you alone
answer for that.

47:29.305 --> 47:31.297
And your spirit
is precious to God,

47:33.684 --> 47:35.846
as precious as
that of your husband

47:36.687 --> 47:37.768
or your father.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.729
Then who should we obey?

47:40.900 --> 47:42.641
If God commands one thing,

47:43.486 --> 47:48.072
but our husbands, our fathers,
tell us another?

47:49.950 --> 47:51.486
You must follow God.

47:53.329 --> 47:56.367
So are we to defy them
and leave our lives behind?

47:56.457 --> 47:57.538
Yes.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.418
Though they judge you,

48:04.924 --> 48:06.335
persecute you,

48:08.969 --> 48:10.335
you must forgive them.

48:11.722 --> 48:12.803
Forgive them?

48:16.185 --> 48:19.849
A year ago,
a woman from Cana...

48:21.273 --> 48:23.060
Many of us knew her here.

48:23.818 --> 48:24.979
She was young.

48:25.986 --> 48:28.353
Her husband found her
with another man,

48:30.074 --> 48:32.532
and he and his brothers,

48:34.245 --> 48:36.703
they dragged her to the river,
and they raped her.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.580
And after they were done,

48:43.796 --> 48:45.207
they drowned her.

48:48.926 --> 48:53.967
In the court, before they were sentenced,
one of them repented,

48:54.056 --> 48:56.139
"God forgive me."

49:00.020 --> 49:01.431
But I'm not God, Father.

49:03.274 --> 49:06.017
How does it feel to carry
that hate in your heart?

49:09.155 --> 49:11.442
Does it lessen
as the months go by?

49:14.660 --> 49:16.822
It seeps into your days,

49:17.997 --> 49:19.078
your nights,

49:20.875 --> 49:24.084
until it consumes everything
you once were.

49:26.297 --> 49:27.333
Those men,

49:28.382 --> 49:30.169
they too
were filled with hate.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.971
You are strong, sister.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.642
But you must forgive.

49:44.607 --> 49:47.475
There is no other way
to enter the kingdom of God.

49:50.237 --> 49:51.353
Will you join us?

49:54.325 --> 49:55.861
Will you be born anew?

50:27.525 --> 50:29.437
I baptize you with water.

50:29.527 --> 50:32.486
I baptize you with light
and with fire

50:32.571 --> 50:36.440
to be born anew, awake,
and ready for the day to come.

50:43.374 --> 50:44.831
I baptize you with water.

50:45.668 --> 50:48.001
<i>I baptize you with light
and with fire</i>

50:48.587 --> 50:51.876
to be born anew, awake,
and ready for the day to come.

51:42.057 --> 51:43.138
Judas, wake up!

51:43.434 --> 51:45.721
- What?
- James, the rabbi's leaving.

51:45.811 --> 51:46.801
What's wrong?

51:47.396 --> 51:48.477
- Move.
- Come on, hurry.

51:48.564 --> 51:50.055
- Mary, what's happening?
- Where is he?

52:40.699 --> 52:42.031
You're the healer.

52:42.951 --> 52:46.661
I prayed for you to come,
but it's too late.

55:25.531 --> 55:28.399
Now I know that
you are the Son of God.

55:28.492 --> 55:31.155
And the people will
shout it from the rooftops.

55:32.538 --> 55:33.528
Lazarus.

55:33.622 --> 55:36.956
Peter, we need to get back to the mountains,
and quickly.

55:37.042 --> 55:38.829
No, this is what
we've been waiting for.

55:53.141 --> 55:54.222
Rabbi?

56:14.997 --> 56:16.704
I saw it so clearly.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.620
And now it's slipping away.

56:26.842 --> 56:29.175
What is?

56:31.430 --> 56:32.511
This life.

56:52.075 --> 56:54.943
I can feel the blood
running through your veins.

57:00.667 --> 57:02.579
I can see light
in your eyes.

57:04.630 --> 57:05.791
You're here now.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.247
I'm here.

57:09.551 --> 57:10.962
Be here with me.

57:16.350 --> 57:19.309
But the path,
it goes into darkness.

57:22.522 --> 57:24.354
And I will walk it with you.

57:29.613 --> 57:30.854
Jerusalem.

58:05.941 --> 58:07.557
Come to Jerusalem. Join us.

58:14.616 --> 58:16.778
Spread the word.
Come with us to Jerusalem.

58:59.369 --> 59:03.113
You've given this gift
of your faith.

59:04.833 --> 59:07.291
And your faith lights up
the whole world.

59:10.422 --> 59:12.505
So I will give you
a gift of prayer.

59:16.136 --> 59:18.173
It is the prayer
of the Baptist.

59:20.474 --> 59:23.558
It is the prayer
of the humble

59:25.020 --> 59:26.056
and the meek

59:27.856 --> 59:29.313
and the poor in spirit

59:30.692 --> 59:33.935
and those who hunger
to know God's true kingdom,

59:37.157 --> 59:40.525
the kingdom which will be
yours in the days to come.

59:43.830 --> 59:44.820
Mary.

59:50.504 --> 59:53.121
Go to them while they pray.

59:53.215 --> 59:54.205
Bless them.

59:56.343 --> 59:57.584
Be my hands.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:04.928
May the Lord
be with you.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.099
Lord,

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:11.229
hallowed be Your name.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:13.892
Peace be with you.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.692
Your kingdom come.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.112
Give us today

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.110
the bread of tomorrow.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.113
May the Lord be with you.
Peace be upon you.

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:24.827
And forgive us our debts.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.918
For we forgive everyone
who is indebted to us.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.671
And do not bring us
to the test.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.215
May peace be upon you.

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:44.471
Amen.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.762
Messiah.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.226
Messiah.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.135
Is it beginning?

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:28.348
Send everyone
out to preach, heal.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:31.974
Spread the message
as if I were with you, Peter.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.436
Take Mary with you alone.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:41.729
Be my apostles.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.447
Yes.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.384
Did he say what he saw?

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:06.762
I think it was a vision
of what's to come.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:09.844
The kingdom.

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:14.353
We need to gather more people.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:17.265
Jerusalem.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.604
Passover.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.941
That is where he'll begin it.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.694
How?

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:28.818
I haven't questioned him.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.074
I think
he's afraid to go.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:36.701
He's afraid of what
God might ask of him next.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.037
Our rabbi fears nothing.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.002
I'm glad for his humility.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.586
Are you?

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:51.382
There are a few hundred
people in the village.

01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:55.345
I'll find somewhere to teach
while you gather them together.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.535
Romans.
We must be careful.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.662
They've destroyed everything.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.459
Where are the people?

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.415
Everyone
that could has fled.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.918
Please, God, deliver us.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.433
- Where are you going?
- They need water.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:17.851
Mary, we can't stay here.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:19.303
Mary!

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.772
These people
are beyond our help.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.480
There's nothing we can do.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.071
We need to
move to other towns.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.120
Mary!

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.505
We need to baptize
those who are able to join us.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.509
He himself has...

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:52.177
He himself has told us!

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.838
Mary, we must go.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.722
It's her time.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.726
Take the child.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.607
Come, child. Come, come.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:35.315
Come. Peace, peace, child.

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:45.912
Look at me.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.542
Look at me.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:54.626
You are seen and heard
in every act of care.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.887
You answer to God
with every act of love.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:14.854
Stay, child. Stay!

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:02.276
<i>My son was</i>

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:06.489
hiding my tools in the sand.

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:12.453
And suddenly,

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.377
he was there.

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:18.796
Jesus of Nazareth.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:20.636
He called my name.

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:23.760
That's all.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.636
And it was like everything

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:33.933
that I had in my life,

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.068
they were like

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:41.564
those pictures
painted on glass.

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:49.741
And he became the only
real thing in the world.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:54.957
But what you did
in the village...

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:11.390
Mercy.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.984
That was mercy.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:24.293
Who is that?

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:26.966
His mother.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.516
He sent for you?

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:24.524
Why?

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:28.157
Does a son need a reason
to ask for his mother?

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.413
I used to call
for my mother in the night.

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.456
She died when
I was just a little girl.

01:11:41.589 --> 01:11:43.501
I would wake up
just before dawn,

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:45.875
and I would forget
that she was gone,

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.469
and I couldn't understand
why she wasn't there.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.104
But he has you.

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:11.525
He used to run to me
so often when he was little,

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:15.620
always getting things wrong,

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.954
crying all night because
his friends said he had

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.578
the devil in him.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:32.680
I loved him, you see,
but he was never completely mine.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.760
God must have asked
so much of you.

01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:48.020
What about what God
has asked of you?

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:50.860
To leave your home,

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:52.949
your family.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.447
And you love my son,
don't you?

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.251
Then you must
prepare yourself, like me.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:08.627
For what?

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:10.834
To lose him.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:01.536
Rabbi.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.665
When they see your work,
they will rise.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:10.336
Lead us, Rabbi.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.291
Lead Jerusalem
to God's kingdom.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:19.137
Join us!
The great prophet is amongst us!

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.010
Spread the word. Join us!

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:23.304
Jesus is here!

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.347
Join us!

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:27.680
Jesus of Nazareth
is amongst you!

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:28.934
Join us!

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.145
- Welcome!
- Good to see you.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.476
We have spread the word.

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:34.144
Will he speak today?

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.737
We have somewhere
away from Roman eyes.

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:38.190
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:39.400
Make way!

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:41.155
Jesus has come.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:42.656
He has come. He has come!

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.117
- Come with us!
- Jesus will lead us!

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.081
Follow us!

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.826
Jesus of Nazareth is here!
Jesus is here!

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.377
Jesus will lead us!

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:52.454
Rejoice!

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:54.873
The temple.

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.717
He's going
straight to the temple!

01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:59.465
Tell everyone.
Tell the people.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:00.545
Rabbi.

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:02.381
To the temple. Join us!

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:04.132
Mary.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:07.223
He will bring in the kingdom
from the temple itself.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:09.687
The beloved dead
will rise!

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.064
Come with us!

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:16.486
It's beginning.
Wait for his sign!

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:24.952
Rejoice!

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.364
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:09.118
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:11.533
Sent to you by God!

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:24.421
Sent to you by God!

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.302
The Lord's miracle

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:27.758
and wonders

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.015
and signs sent to you!

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:34.147
Jesus of Nazareth is here!

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:35.857
These are the words of God.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.605
My dear ones.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:41.483
I'm coming to you.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:43.657
He said, "I will
baptize you with water,

01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:45.734
"but He will baptize you
with spirit."

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.991
Follow Jesus of Nazareth.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:57.712
I would say, every word that
Jesus says is the word of God.

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.207
Words of God.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:21.796
It is time! It is time!

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:23.540
Esther!

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.587
Sarah!

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:27.794
You'll be coming soon!

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:31.097
It is time! It is time!

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.219
You are a priest
of this place?

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.482
Isn't it written

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:46.318
that "my house shall be a house
of prayer for all nations"?

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.113
As you see.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:51.655
This is a marketplace.

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:57.366
A place to buy God's forgiveness
with a dove or a lamb.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.586
The people need to make their sacrifices,
as they've always done,

01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:03.959
as God demands of us.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.844
And does God demand that this

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.090
is how the people should show
their true repentance?

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:16.054
A flick of your knife
on the altar?

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:18.971
A psalm to recite
on their way out?

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:24.894
Have their hearts been altered
when they leave this place?

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:30.236
Are they willing to change their lives,
to give up everything,

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:31.737
and follow God?

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.667
He's mad. He's crazy!

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:44.246
God's kingdom is not to be
bought and sold!

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.053
It is time! It is time!

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:58.393
He's destroying the temple!
Grab him!

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:04.807
Rabbi!

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.685
- He's mad!
- Don't do it!

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:16.987
Not one stone.

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:22.076
Not one stone of this place will be
left which will not be torn down!

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:26.253
You can't hurt him now!

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:31.585
Nothing you can do
can touch him!

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:34.800
Move!

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:47.150
Get him out!

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.523
- Get back.
- Get him out! Get him out.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:55.367
God will judge you!
He will judge you all!

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:00.868
- Get him out!
- Stand back!

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.331
Hurry! Hurry!

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:08.162
What's he doing?

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:09.373
Rabbi!

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.883
You will bring ruin
to us all!

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:13.960
Do it!

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:16.463
Rabbi! Begin it!

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:22.305
Begin it now!

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:28.562
Rabbi! You must begin it!

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:01.140
It was the perfect time.
It was the perfect time.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.135
Why didn't he begin it?

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:07.263
Why didn't he begin it?

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:30.537
Brother, come.
You are safe.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:32.588
Come. Welcome.

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:34.123
Welcome, my brother.

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:51.141
We will keep
Passover here tonight.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:52.854
What about tomorrow, brother?

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.317
Tomorrow, we try again.

01:23:57.908 --> 01:23:59.444
- Did he say...
- No.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:04.154
For now,
we leave him to rest.

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:07.790
Later, he wishes us
to go to the hills with him

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.117
to be with God.

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:12.500
Peter, we should act
while the feeling is high.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:14.706
But they will be
hunting us now.

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:18.126
He needs to act soon.
He's stalling.

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:22.964
I think there will be another miracle,
some kind of sign.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.015
So many rose up
in support.

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:26.968
The kingdom will come.

01:24:56.717 --> 01:25:00.176
I have seen you heal the sick,

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:02.715
raise the dead.

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:12.059
One word from you, and I know God
would turn this world upside down.

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.480
Just as the prophets
told us he would.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:20.689
The poor,

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:24.158
the suffering,

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:28.454
the dead,

01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:34.410
the beloved dead

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:38.877
will rise,

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:41.629
and you will be crowned king.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:49.725
Say the word.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:54.056
We have given you everything.

01:25:55.942 --> 01:25:57.103
Our lives.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:25:59.731
Our hope.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.029
Perhaps we have misunderstood.

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.199
Perhaps the kingdom is not...

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:06.401
No!

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.113
Our faith is what
makes the miracles.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:12.331
Our belief.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:15.952
Tell her.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.542
Tell her she's wrong.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.675
Tell her she's wrong.

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:34.933
Judas.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:23.523
When the Baptist anointed me,

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:28.487
there was no holy oil,

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.077
no ceremony.

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:42.539
And it was like this.

01:27:58.023 --> 01:28:00.390
Open your eyes
to the light.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.781
It has begun.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.290
Don't stop it now.

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:21.665
Don't let them stop it.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:28.759
I'll be with you.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.221
I won't leave.

01:28:33.099 --> 01:28:34.340
Mary.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.562
You are my witness.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:00.241
Everything is prepared.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:05.222
Give thanks
to the Lord,

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.398
for herein lies good.

01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:13.989
A love that endures forever.

01:30:26.212 --> 01:30:27.828
Let Israel declare...

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:29.963
His steadfast love is eternal.

01:30:31.801 --> 01:30:33.588
Let the house
of Aaron declare...

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:36.762
His steadfast love is eternal.

01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:39.507
Let those who fear
the Lord declare...

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:41.934
His steadfast love is eternal.

01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:17.988
What is it, Rabbi?

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:26.705
I'm only sad because
I must leave you all.

01:32:30.837 --> 01:32:32.373
Where are you going?

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.626
To God.

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:51.605
He's foreseen something.

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:54.149
We need to take him
away from here.

01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:56.811
Back to Cana, maybe.

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:00.276
By force, if need be.

01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:01.777
Matthew is right.

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:04.447
He's foreseen something.

01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:07.489
Whatever happens now
is what God has asked of him.

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:10.241
We have to honor his decision.

01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:11.704
Even if he dies?

01:33:11.795 --> 01:33:14.082
Has any of this happened
as you expected it to?

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:19.000
If we don't understand,
it's because it's beyond our understanding.

01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:21.335
So let him what?

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:24.258
Abandon us? Die?

01:33:24.349 --> 01:33:25.885
We have to trust him, Philip.

01:33:28.103 --> 01:33:29.560
He's gone to pray.

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:32.597
We should do the same.

01:33:34.692 --> 01:33:36.024
This is wrong.

01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:40.901
This is wrong.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:11.487
- Rabbi!
- Run!

01:35:11.581 --> 01:35:14.665
- Rabbi, run!
- Rabbi, run!

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:15.741
Run!

01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:16.996
Jesus of Nazareth!

01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:18.960
- Run!
- No!

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:34.718
He was delaying.

01:35:35.271 --> 01:35:36.478
He was afraid.

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:40.440
Now he has to act
to save himself.

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.733
No more waiting, Mary.

01:35:45.782 --> 01:35:47.444
He will begin it today.

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:51.448
The righteous will rise again.

01:35:53.373 --> 01:35:54.830
What did you do?

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:57.954
They will have sentenced him.

01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:23.900
Save him!

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:37.702
Rabbi!

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:39.203
Rabbi!

01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:41.039
Please!
He is the Savior!

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:43.541
Get back!

01:36:52.181 --> 01:36:54.047
Lord! Savior!

01:42:39.236 --> 01:42:40.602
Where will you go?

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:45.365
To my family.

01:44:50.326 --> 01:44:51.316
<i>Mary.</i>

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:29.442
- Mary.
- Matthew.

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:44.501
You were with him?

01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:47.797
To the end.

01:45:49.969 --> 01:45:53.462
Peter, as the sun rose,
I saw him.

01:45:56.058 --> 01:45:57.890
He was there, and he was...

01:45:59.895 --> 01:46:01.727
All his pain
was gone from him.

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.430
A dream.

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:07.017
It wasn't a dream.
He was there.

01:46:08.279 --> 01:46:10.362
Mary, he is gone from us.

01:46:12.324 --> 01:46:13.610
He is dead.

01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.151
He's not gone.

01:46:17.413 --> 01:46:19.450
Even death cannot hold him.

01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:22.912
This whole time,
we've been looking for a change in the world,

01:46:23.002 --> 01:46:24.413
but it's not what we thought.

01:46:25.546 --> 01:46:27.412
The kingdom is here, now.

01:46:27.506 --> 01:46:29.873
We failed.
There is no kingdom.

01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:31.879
What, the people would rise,

01:46:32.845 --> 01:46:35.633
that he would be crowned king,
did he ever say this to you?

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:37.130
Mary.

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:40.850
You saw him? Truly?

01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:45.309
But then, the kingdom,
how can that be right?

01:46:45.399 --> 01:46:48.563
Because it's not something
we can see with our eyes.

01:46:50.487 --> 01:46:52.228
It's here within us.

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.323
All we have to do is let go of
our anguish and our resentment,

01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:57.742
and we become like children,
just as he said.

01:46:57.828 --> 01:46:58.944
What do you mean?

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.914
The kingdom,
it can't be built through conflict.

01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:05.951
Not by opposition,
not by destruction.

01:47:06.545 --> 01:47:10.038
It grows with us,
with every act of love and care,

01:47:10.132 --> 01:47:11.213
with our forgiveness.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.633
We have the power
to lift the people,

01:47:13.761 --> 01:47:16.674
just as he did,
and then we will be free, just as he is.

01:47:17.181 --> 01:47:18.513
This is what he meant?

01:47:19.808 --> 01:47:21.765
And we've been walking
this path to revolution,

01:47:21.852 --> 01:47:24.469
as if the kingdom would be
born in flames and blood.

01:47:24.813 --> 01:47:25.803
Mary.

01:47:28.067 --> 01:47:29.558
Why would he
come to you alone?

01:47:30.027 --> 01:47:31.393
Why does that matter?

01:47:31.487 --> 01:47:34.696
Because you say the kingdom is here.
Now.

01:47:37.409 --> 01:47:39.901
And just outside that door,
there is no new world.

01:47:41.705 --> 01:47:43.241
No end of oppression.

01:47:45.334 --> 01:47:48.793
No justice for the poor,
for the suffering.

01:47:50.172 --> 01:47:53.461
How does it feel to carry that
anger around in your heart?

01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:57.298
Does it lessen
as the days go by?

01:47:59.848 --> 01:48:02.431
We have the power
to relieve their suffering.

01:48:02.518 --> 01:48:03.929
It is up to us.

01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:10.640
I believe you, Mary.

01:48:14.363 --> 01:48:16.275
I believe that you saw him,

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:20.445
that he came to you,

01:48:23.872 --> 01:48:25.204
and it was a sign

01:48:27.626 --> 01:48:29.492
that he will return,

01:48:30.671 --> 01:48:32.458
and he will bring the kingdom,

01:48:34.633 --> 01:48:35.874
the true kingdom.

01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:40.928
The new world.

01:48:42.975 --> 01:48:46.139
The world will only change
as we change.

01:48:50.232 --> 01:48:55.398
It's not right that you come here now
to tell us he has chosen you before us,

01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:59.902
that he has brought you
some special message.

01:49:00.034 --> 01:49:02.321
He gathered us
for what was inside.

01:49:02.411 --> 01:49:04.778
We were all precious to him.
We were all his apostles.

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:06.738
Every man in this room

01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:10.120
is his rock,

01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:11.955
his church

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:16.456
upon which he will build

01:49:17.259 --> 01:49:19.546
his glorious new world

01:49:21.597 --> 01:49:23.179
with one purpose

01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:27.008
and one message.

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:28.930
Your message.

01:49:30.064 --> 01:49:31.350
Not his.

01:49:34.943 --> 01:49:37.185
You have weakened us, Mary.

01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:42.156
You weakened him.

01:49:57.883 --> 01:50:01.047
All I can do is hope that
you've heard what I have said.

01:50:03.972 --> 01:50:06.259
Pray that you see me as I am.

01:50:08.685 --> 01:50:11.177
I value each one of you
as he did.

01:50:14.483 --> 01:50:17.066
You are all my brothers,
and I thank you.

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:25.237
But I will not stay
and be silent.

01:50:27.329 --> 01:50:28.740
I will be heard.

01:51:11.582 --> 01:51:13.414
You do not lose heart.

01:51:14.751 --> 01:51:15.912
Even now.

01:51:22.676 --> 01:51:25.384
Didn't you ask,
"What will it be like?

01:51:27.931 --> 01:51:29.217
"The kingdom?"

01:51:50.662 --> 01:51:52.278
<i>It is like a seed.</i>

01:51:55.834 --> 01:51:58.497
<i>A single grain
of mustard seed,</i>

01:51:59.922 --> 01:52:02.835
<i>which a woman took
and sowed in her garden.</i>

01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:06.258
<i>And it grew,</i>

01:52:07.971 --> 01:52:09.337
<i>and it grew.</i>

01:52:11.266 --> 01:52:15.351
<i>And the birds of the air
made nests in its branches.</i>
