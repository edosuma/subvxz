WEBVTT

00:05.960 --> 00:09.240
This is an unprecedented season
for Juventus.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.240
A first-time coach

00:12.320 --> 00:14.760
and a solid group who has to teach

00:14.840 --> 00:17.880
the new players their values and vision.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.840
We have to win!

00:22.600 --> 00:24.920
Important victories, at home and abroad,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.720
give hope that they will win
their tenth scudetto.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.400
We want to win!

00:34.840 --> 00:36.760
The championship is long way away.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.320
Will the new leadership
meet the expectations?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.560
TURIN
DECEMBER 2020

00:49.600 --> 00:54.480
Christmas is approaching,
and Juventus has won many important games.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.120
Their supporters are hopeful
and confident again.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.720
The team ranks third,
four points behind Milan.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.800
The championship is still a long way away.
There's enough time to catch up.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.560
Thanks to the commitment
of the club and staff,

01:10.640 --> 01:13.160
the new players are settling in

01:14.160 --> 01:15.560
and the mood is good.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.040
Don't give up

01:24.360 --> 01:27.240
We have a dream in our heart

01:28.360 --> 01:31.160
Gigio will become a champion

01:36.640 --> 01:39.640
There's only one game left
before the Christmas break,

01:40.120 --> 01:42.760
and it is vital
that players keep concentrated.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.160
They each have their own way to recharge.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.720
ÁLVARO MORATA
STRIKER

01:48.800 --> 01:50.880
What would you like from Santa?

01:50.960 --> 01:52.880
-A bike.
-A bike?

01:53.840 --> 01:55.280
What would you like?

01:55.560 --> 01:56.520
A bike as well?

01:57.480 --> 01:58.880
A Juventus ball.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.200
A Juventus ball.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.760
Let's put it under the tree,

02:04.200 --> 02:06.360
so, when Santa brings the presents,

02:07.160 --> 02:09.360
he will drink some milk because...

02:09.440 --> 02:13.520
He also has to visit other kids,
those who've been good.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.720
And the candy.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.160
Have you been good?

02:16.280 --> 02:17.120
Yes.

02:19.080 --> 02:23.560
And so, the great champions find
a balance between work and private life.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.600
Careful, if it falls, it'll break, Leo.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.080
Let's see how you do.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.440
See, you did it, buddy.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.160
Because when you concentrate,

02:40.240 --> 02:43.240
you're as good as your daddy,
just concentrate.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.720
When you are both concentrated.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.440
And the last one?

02:47.560 --> 02:51.280
For me, Christmas is a time

02:51.640 --> 02:54.160
of the year during which...

02:54.240 --> 02:55.800
GIANLUIGI BUFFON
GOALKEEPER

02:55.880 --> 02:58.040
...there's something special in the air.

02:58.520 --> 03:03.280
People come together,
and that's what I want for my kids.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.520
Just like the magic of Christmas
I felt as a kid...

03:10.160 --> 03:14.480
I am sure these are memories
they will have

03:14.680 --> 03:16.680
20 or 30 years from now.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.480
I have always been the head
and she has been the hands.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.560
Always.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.320
-There is an architect and a worker.
-I'm the worker.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.240
-Did you get it, sweetie?
-I want to do it too.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.560
What Gigi and I learned...

03:36.640 --> 03:38.920
ILARIA D'AMICO
JOURNALIST AND BUFFON'S PARTNER

03:39.000 --> 03:42.720
...when we fell in love
and decided to go for an extended family

03:42.800 --> 03:48.760
is to roll up our sleeves
and commit to our children.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.360
You need a lot of love and heart,

03:52.440 --> 03:56.080
and that's always easier
if you really love the other person.

03:56.920 --> 04:01.080
-I know who does this one.
-Put it at the top with your brothers.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.760
Who does this one? He does.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.280
Who usually does it?

04:07.360 --> 04:10.360
Let's put it to a vote. So, who votes...

04:10.800 --> 04:13.440
for daddy and who votes for Leo?

04:14.960 --> 04:16.240
Should we let Leo do it?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.280
-Yes.
-Okay.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.640
Wait. No.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.160
-Wait.
-Push it down. Yes!

04:26.240 --> 04:29.160
Yes! Let's give him a round of applause!

04:35.600 --> 04:37.320
ALLIANZ STADIUM
22 DECEMBER 2020

04:37.360 --> 04:39.920
There's no time tonight
to think about Christmas.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.040
Juventus will play Fiorentina
in the last game of the year.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.360
Pirlo's team hasn't been beaten
in two months,

04:51.480 --> 04:55.200
but this is an historic game
that Juve can't lose.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.560
Juventus and Fiorentina is one
of many rivalries in Italian soccer.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.160
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST

05:11.520 --> 05:15.800
The long-standing rivalry
reached its peak in 1990,

05:15.920 --> 05:19.440
when Juve bought
Fiorentina's beloved striker,

05:19.520 --> 05:21.520
the Divine Ponytail, Roberto Baggio.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.080
At the beginning of this season,

05:33.160 --> 05:37.000
another transfer embittered
the relationship between supporters,

05:37.120 --> 05:39.200
that of midfielder Federico Chiesa,

05:39.280 --> 05:42.600
who is playing against his former team
for the first time.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.960
Chiesa considers this game
a very special one.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.800
He grew up in Fiorentina,
he was the captain there,

05:55.880 --> 06:01.760
so he will encounter his friends and the
atmosphere that made him a soccer player.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.200
-Come on, boys!
-Come on!

06:05.280 --> 06:08.560
Fiorentina is holding all the cards

06:08.640 --> 06:12.320
in this game against Juventus.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.080
These are the rules in sport,
it's David and Goliath.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.960
For Fiorentina, it's the game of the year.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.160
Here we go. Come on.

06:22.640 --> 06:27.600
Vacation starts tomorrow! Focus!
Let's steal the ball and move forward.

06:28.720 --> 06:32.080
That's how we have fun. We play this game,

06:32.160 --> 06:36.520
we win, we stop for a week.
Let's focus, let's give it our all!

06:36.640 --> 06:40.360
When we wear this shirt,
there is only one way to go.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.400
We have to go and win, win, win!

06:47.240 --> 06:49.280
-Let's go!
-Yes!

06:52.200 --> 06:56.400
In spite of sitting on the sidelines,
Buffon has a crucial role tonight.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.720
The referee whistles. Here we go
with Juventus versus Fiorentina.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.200
Come on, Leo!

07:09.200 --> 07:12.000
Vlahović, wait for it, Vlahović, Vlahović!

07:14.080 --> 07:16.280
Vlahović scores for Fiorentina.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.720
It's off to a very bad start.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.280
After only three minutes,
due to a defensive error,

07:24.600 --> 07:26.240
the team is a goal down.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.920
Fuck off! For crying out loud!

07:58.160 --> 08:03.080
A very difficult moment for Juventus.
A goal down, a man down.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.440
Juventus will have to play
almost the whole game

08:07.760 --> 08:11.440
with 10 men.
Juan Cuadrado has been sent off.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.840
Fede, it's yours.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.520
-Legs!
-Come on, Fede, get up!

08:20.440 --> 08:25.920
At halftime,
Juventus is a goal and a man down.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.000
It's an uphill struggle.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.320
If we don't focus, we will look like shit.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.200
We are too soft.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.160
Focus, or we will look like shit.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.520
So let's grow a pair
and turn the game around.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.200
-Come on!
-Come on, guys!

08:44.440 --> 08:47.080
-Go!
-Come on, guys!

09:00.840 --> 09:03.360
Juventus has been very unlucky.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.880
Alex Sandro's own goal has let down
the team and supporters.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.600
It'll be difficult to win a game
when they are two goals down.

09:13.440 --> 09:18.520
Vice-chairman Pavel Nedvěd
and supporters are utterly disappointed.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.200
Three-nil for Fiorentina
here in Turin against Juventus.

09:42.120 --> 09:47.120
Juve faces their first defeat
of the season, three-nil,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.720
on their home field against Fiorentina.

10:12.440 --> 10:17.760
Fiorentina was definitely better,
never mind that Juve had only 10 players.

10:17.880 --> 10:22.000
Something happened.
We switched from being the best Juve

10:22.080 --> 10:27.960
to a team that had to accept the referee's
decisions, which were undisputed.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.640
Fiorentina played a great game
and it is only fair they enjoy...

10:33.840 --> 10:37.520
...what could be
the turning point of the season.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.040
The first half of the season ends
with a bitter defeat

10:45.120 --> 10:47.200
which dampens the Christmas spirit.

10:47.600 --> 10:52.600
Everybody will have to ponder
their mistakes over the next few days.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.080
Pavel Nedvěd has spent
half of his life at Juve,

11:03.160 --> 11:05.360
which is now embedded in his DNA.

11:05.920 --> 11:10.280
He is a hot-blooded man
who has a hard time accepting defeat.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.520
For this kind of game I have to be...

11:17.000 --> 11:20.320
I have to act like a manager.
It's not easy,

11:20.720 --> 11:25.400
because I still felt like a former player
during the early years.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.360
It's different now. I have to remember

11:31.280 --> 11:34.360
to keep calm, and that's not easy.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.720
Sometimes your heart and passion
lead you to make mistakes.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.320
As a player, Nedvěd helped
Juve win many times

11:49.400 --> 11:51.520
and he won the Golden Ball in 2003.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.360
When he decided to retire
after eight amazing years,

11:55.440 --> 12:00.320
Andrea Agnelli chose him to help
create an even stronger team.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.800
THE MAN OF THE MATCH

12:12.880 --> 12:15.560
It has been 20 years
and that's a long time.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.200
I've spent more time in Italy
than in the Czech Republic.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.600
I spent 23 years in the Czech Republic

12:24.480 --> 12:26.400
and 25 in Italy, so...

12:27.880 --> 12:30.720
I should get an Italian passport.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.360
Hi, Gianna!

12:46.040 --> 12:49.000
-Hi, Leo!
-You look good in black and white.

12:50.040 --> 12:54.240
Leonardo Bonucci was the team captain
in the game against Fiorentina,

12:54.320 --> 12:58.080
and he admits it wasn't
his best performance.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.720
-Yes.
-No.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.840
But today, wishing his fans
a Merry Christmas on a call,

13:04.920 --> 13:08.600
he can show his worth
and his humility once again,

13:08.960 --> 13:11.680
taking responsibility for the defeat.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.520
Look, these are my two bodyguards.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.800
-How are you?
-Hi, darlings. How are you guys?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.040
-Good.
-Good.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.400
So far I haven't been insulted
because of yesterday evening.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.280
Here I am. It's all happening.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.720
-It's all happening.
-Are you for real?

13:33.440 --> 13:34.560
Hi, Federico!

13:34.640 --> 13:37.040
As the team's captain,

13:37.920 --> 13:42.240
I felt like apologizing to my supporters

13:42.320 --> 13:44.960
because it is not fair...

13:45.040 --> 13:46.520
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

13:46.640 --> 13:50.680
...for Juve to play this way.
We made a lot of mistakes

13:50.960 --> 13:52.960
in our approach, in our attitude.

13:53.480 --> 13:58.640
At least you are out here, I admire that.
Others would hide. What can I say?

13:58.720 --> 14:00.040
That's how I am.

14:00.120 --> 14:05.240
I have a clear conscience
and I am always ready

14:05.680 --> 14:08.000
to put myself out there,
for better or worse.

14:08.080 --> 14:13.400
Good. We will get what we deserve,
as we have done for nine years.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.600
For better or worse,

14:17.600 --> 14:21.280
I take my responsibilities.
I have always been honest

14:21.680 --> 14:23.440
and I have tried to have my say.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.560
Hi, Mattia!

14:26.840 --> 14:27.760
Hello!

14:29.480 --> 14:33.400
Obviously it has spoiled my Christmas,
because when I lose,

14:33.520 --> 14:37.360
I am not happy or relaxed,
but it's also okay,

14:38.680 --> 14:44.120
after a day of disappointment, anger
and sadness, to move forward.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.680
The JTC Continassa,
the first team's training center,

15:03.760 --> 15:06.120
is full again after the Christmas break.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.400
Good morning.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.560
Players are back at work
wanting to move past

15:13.640 --> 15:16.200
their disappointing defeat
against Fiorentina.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.040
The first game of the new year
will be against Udinese.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.920
If Juve wants the scudetto,

15:24.040 --> 15:26.600
they can't afford to lose.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.640
TURIN
3 JANUARY 2021

15:29.720 --> 15:32.160
The Bianconeri are off to a great start.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.960
They want to make up
for those three points they lost

15:36.040 --> 15:37.880
against Fiorentina.

15:37.960 --> 15:38.920
Unity is strength.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.640
Let's be a team.
We won't win if we are not.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.760
From the Allianz Stadium in Turin,
it's Juventus against Udinese.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.760
They're ready to win again.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.880
And so begins the first game of 2021.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.280
De Paul is pressed from behind.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.360
Here comes Juve,
Ronaldo is going for the goal.

16:16.360 --> 16:19.880
Ronaldo! Juventus takes the lead!

16:20.560 --> 16:24.840
Recharged after the break,
the team is at their best.

16:26.440 --> 16:31.360
From the Allianz Stadium in Turin,
it's Juventus 1, Udinese 0 at halftime.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.600
Great. Let's keep compact.
We need to press them on the left.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.280
Steal the ball.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.880
It has to be in their half of the field.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.520
We have to win. Use your head.

16:48.960 --> 16:53.400
Don't forget to play your best
until the end of the game.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.200
Here we go again.

17:05.240 --> 17:08.720
Alex Sandro to Ronaldo,
Ronaldo on the outside, great ball

17:08.800 --> 17:10.320
looking for Chiesa, Chiesa!

17:11.920 --> 17:15.880
Chiesa! Second goal for Juventus!
Federico Chiesa!

17:16.200 --> 17:21.440
Ronaldo and Chiesa's offense
let Juventus rule the game.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.800
In for Ronaldo, here we go, it's Ronaldo!

17:25.960 --> 17:30.880
Ronaldo! Juventus 3, Udinese 0!

17:33.320 --> 17:37.160
Cross, dribbling, great action
from number 16, Molina, goal!

17:37.640 --> 17:39.040
It's a goal!

17:39.080 --> 17:42.320
Zeegelaar scores a goal for Udinese.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.560
Danilo is in, ball to Dybala,
here we go, Paulo Dybala, Dybala!

17:48.560 --> 17:52.920
Dybala! Four to one for Juventus!
Paulo Dybala!

17:53.480 --> 17:55.960
A spectacular score of four to one

17:56.280 --> 18:00.400
allows the team make their run
for a 10th scudetto

18:00.480 --> 18:02.280
in the second half of the season.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.760
-Great one.
-Good morning.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.080
-Good morning.
-Admit it, you've always been a Juve fan.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.800
-You are not positive, are you?
-Me?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.280
-You?
-I've had everything.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.960
-You had it?
-Oh, yeah.

18:27.160 --> 18:31.720
An old friend's visit cheers Pirlo up

18:31.800 --> 18:34.200
after the tension of managing
the first team.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.480
When he was 22, he became
the youngest captain in Serie A soccer

18:44.560 --> 18:46.880
and played with Pirlo for Italy

18:47.240 --> 18:49.920
when they won the World Cup in 2006.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.280
I'm going to Milan tomorrow.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.720
-How will you get around?
-By car.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.560
-Don't you need a certificate?
-I do.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.400
They all have fucking Pirlo shirts.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.800
-Still?
-They still want them.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.200
-They still like us.
-They had them reprinted.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.880
It's tough, isn't it? At first it is.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.960
It's always tough,
every three days when you play.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.800
There is not enough time to get ready.

19:25.800 --> 19:30.280
You play and you discharge,
you have 13 players.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.240
I wish! Thirteen is a lot.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.440
Bye, Fra.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.720
I'll write you from time to time.
If you need anything...

19:38.800 --> 19:41.400
If you have something good,
I'll give it to them.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.240
Bye.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.800
The next game is against Milan,
the league leaders, in San Siro,

19:53.920 --> 19:58.080
and it will be crucial
to their run for the scudetto.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.080
Let's talk about Milan.

20:01.160 --> 20:05.400
They haven't lost one game in a year.
They lead the league.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.520
After 27 games and no defeats,
Milan is the Winter Champion

20:12.560 --> 20:14.480
and they want the scudetto.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.040
It will be a key test for Pirlo.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.800
You have to be fast
and run from side to side,

20:20.880 --> 20:23.000
take them from here to there.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.480
They have four defenders,
they have to let it go somewhere.

20:27.560 --> 20:32.560
You have to understand
what the players think and try...

20:32.640 --> 20:36.400
...to make them understand
that mistakes happen,

20:36.480 --> 20:40.320
but you have to go on.
Soccer is fast, you can't stand still.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.800
Your leg looks better.

20:49.080 --> 20:53.640
Chiellini is still injured,
so Bonucci remains captain.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.680
He will lead the team against Milan.

20:56.960 --> 21:01.680
After the ugly game against Fiorentina,
which he took responsibility for,

21:01.800 --> 21:05.640
Bonucci will have the chance
to make it up against the team

21:05.720 --> 21:07.680
he left Juventus for in 2017.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.320
Something many supporters
haven't accepted yet.

21:17.800 --> 21:23.240
MILAN
2017

21:26.440 --> 21:30.040
Bonucci upset the Juventus fans

21:30.080 --> 21:32.040
when he was transferred to Milan,

21:32.080 --> 21:37.320
mainly because they remembered
some of his statements,

21:37.400 --> 21:40.560
his jubilation in wearing
the Milan shirt in the stadium.

21:41.520 --> 21:46.200
And Leonardo Bonucci costs Juve
its undefeated record.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.320
He has come back in sackcloth and ashes,
convincing some, but not everybody.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.440
He will have to show

21:55.720 --> 22:01.200
his friends and supporters
that he can be a real leader.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.480
How's it going?

22:10.240 --> 22:12.920
Please don't mention Bonucci.

22:18.840 --> 22:23.120
We know supporters judge him
because of Milan,

22:23.360 --> 22:25.720
but he is a very good player.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.520
He may fail too, sometimes.

22:27.920 --> 22:31.280
-Did you take it?
-Yup. Thanks.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.440
This transfer
hasn't still been accepted...

22:34.520 --> 22:36.200
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

22:36.280 --> 22:41.120
...by a small number of supporters,
who I think never will.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.560
You seemed okay on the sidelines.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.640
-I can't be on the sidelines.
-I know.

22:48.920 --> 22:53.480
I have nothing to say against Bonucci.
He's a great player and that's that.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.440
I knew

23:00.360 --> 23:04.600
I'd done something wrong,
but that's the way I am.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.920
Juventus is my home.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.080
Bye, guys.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.680
I'm ready to do anything.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.800
Nine other games
are being played tomorrow,

23:17.880 --> 23:21.080
but the talk of the day is Milan Juventus.

23:21.160 --> 23:26.600
Tomorrow at 8:45 p.m. in San Siro,
they play for the scudetto.

23:26.680 --> 23:27.840
Yes, Pardo.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.840
I believe Juve can still do it.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.760
January will be really complicated
and it's all-in.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.480
Are you taking the swab?

23:37.560 --> 23:39.560
No, already had it.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.760
Somebody is taking the swab.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.080
-Can I make coffee?
-Go ahead.

23:48.360 --> 23:52.920
The game with Milan is important
to reach the top of the championship,

23:53.120 --> 23:56.520
but Juve has many players
with health issues.

24:00.360 --> 24:05.160
Defender Alex Sandro is in quarantine,
having tested positive for Covid.

24:07.960 --> 24:11.760
Striker Álvaro Morata
was injured during practice.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.840
The scan shows
he won't be able to play tomorrow.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.000
-How's it going, Paulo? No fever?
-I had a fever.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.600
Appetite, taste buds...

24:28.120 --> 24:32.080
Dybala isn't in good shape either,
even if he tested negative for Covid.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.000
To win this crucial game,

24:35.080 --> 24:38.760
Pirlo needs his team
to be in perfect health.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.240
How's it going, my friend?

24:44.600 --> 24:46.960
Should I tell him? Cuadrado is positive.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.560
Juan!

24:58.360 --> 25:00.200
-You tested positive.
-For real?

25:06.880 --> 25:09.240
Positive. For now, yes.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.160
We will know for sure in two hours.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.560
Let's have one more meeting,
figure out what to do.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.480
We'll have to redo the line-up.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.200
Redo the line-up and that's it.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.840
Because I don't know what players I have.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.400
No, no...

25:30.480 --> 25:33.600
It's a mess.
We have to rethink everything.

25:34.760 --> 25:40.160
There's no point.
We could lose another player.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.400
Let's stop.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.800
Because we're waiting for the results.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.840
I was at practice when...

25:53.920 --> 25:55.400
JUAN CUADRADO
MIDFIELDER

25:55.480 --> 25:57.200
...they told me I needed to leave

25:57.280 --> 26:00.440
because I'd tested positive.
But I felt fine.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.280
Take them out.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.840
A defender.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.760
Take him out.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.640
And put him in.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.240
Put Rabiot here.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.560
And... Chiesa.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.360
The two strikers.

26:24.880 --> 26:28.320
Cuadrado is an important player for us

26:28.400 --> 26:33.120
and we had the game
planned in a certain way, so...

26:33.200 --> 26:36.400
after a few minutes of commotion, I said,

26:36.800 --> 26:39.640
"We have to play anyway,
so we need a solution."

26:47.440 --> 26:50.000
We have Dybala,
but Pirlo said he had a fever.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.720
Yes, but he said he was okay.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.480
Cuadrado is positive too.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.640
Cuadrado is?

26:59.120 --> 27:01.160
-For real?
-Yes.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.800
How can he play, then?

27:07.400 --> 27:10.320
Three true defenders.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.840
De Ligt...

27:12.760 --> 27:13.920
Bonucci...

27:14.000 --> 27:16.240
Or else Frabotta can play.

27:16.400 --> 27:21.800
I saw him play the other day.
I don't think he can be a first string.

27:24.080 --> 27:28.000
This must be really hard for Pirlo.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.640
Juventus is a wrecked team.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.120
Cuadrado is a playmaker.

27:37.200 --> 27:41.720
He's the one who leads
most of the attacks.

27:47.320 --> 27:51.160
We are going for a four and five
with the Juve emergency.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.400
No problem. Want me to change the pages?

27:54.480 --> 27:57.160
No. Let's leave this headline.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.880
COVID EMERGENCY "WRECKS" JUVE

27:58.960 --> 28:00.800
We can put "Total Emergency."

28:02.640 --> 28:04.160
Losing Cuadrado is tough.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.040
The night before the game against Milan,

28:12.120 --> 28:14.320
the players sleep at the training center

28:14.440 --> 28:18.080
to keep safe from being infected by Covid.

28:18.960 --> 28:23.320
The situation is not simple for Pirlo
who has to change his tactics

28:23.440 --> 28:26.160
because of all the missing players.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.880
It's the turn of...

28:31.680 --> 28:34.400
The first half ends in 1-0 for us.

28:34.960 --> 28:38.640
-The same with the second.
-Okay. Leave it to me.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.960
It's an important game for Bonucci
who'll be playing his former club.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.560
He's the captain
and a sort of big brother,

28:47.640 --> 28:51.960
so he has to give confidence
to the youngest members of the team.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.160
At a certain age, experience helps...

28:55.240 --> 28:56.680
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

28:56.760 --> 29:00.920
...to manage regular games, pre-games
but, above all, important games.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.800
I have always thought that

29:04.360 --> 29:09.760
when you attach importance to an event,
you may not feel like yourself.

29:11.240 --> 29:17.200
The role of the seniors is
to help the youngest relax

29:17.280 --> 29:20.040
when they play these games.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.560
If they are in Juventus, it means that

29:22.640 --> 29:26.240
they have the qualities,
the personality, the temperament,

29:26.680 --> 29:30.920
we can trust them to play these games.

29:38.280 --> 29:42.520
Coach, we are assigning seats on the bus.
I put you here.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.720
-Your bag?
-Let me get one thing out first.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.480
MILAN
6 JANUARY 2021

30:08.560 --> 30:12.480
The Meazza Stadium in Milan,
AKA San Siro, is the biggest in Italy.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.680
A holy temple for world soccer.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.920
Although it could host 78,000 fans,

30:21.560 --> 30:24.120
nobody is allowed in tonight.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.240
Fans will be watching the game from home.

30:28.520 --> 30:34.480
We are in San Siro,
and tonight Milan faces off with Juve.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.000
Let's see. Okay, this is yours.

30:40.120 --> 30:45.720
Today is an important game
to show if we can compete for the title.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.920
Juventus is about
to take the field against Milan

30:51.080 --> 30:54.480
with a weaker and younger team,

30:54.760 --> 30:56.840
and they have to win at all costs.

31:04.680 --> 31:05.960
It's showtime!

31:06.040 --> 31:11.720
The best stadium in Italy opens its doors
to one of the greatest games in the world.

31:13.200 --> 31:18.040
Pirlo's plan is to field a 4-4-2 team.

31:19.560 --> 31:23.680
Bonucci is the only senior.
He has to lead the game.

31:26.240 --> 31:30.040
Juventus is in San Siro
missing three of their players.

31:30.120 --> 31:35.160
Morata is still injured, while Alex Sandro
and Cuadrado have tested positive.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.920
Gianluca Frabotta gets the ball.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.360
Today, he is starting at San Siro.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.440
Frabotta asks for a cross, Dybala!

31:46.040 --> 31:47.960
First chance in the game for Juve!

31:48.240 --> 31:52.280
Frabotta's beautiful play to the left
breaks the ice.

31:52.960 --> 31:56.480
To De Ligt, Kjaer again,
Ramsey, back in the middle.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.880
Header, the ball gets there,
Chiesa! Almost in,

32:00.040 --> 32:02.040
by Federico Chiesa, incredible!

32:02.680 --> 32:04.520
What an opportunity for Juve.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.920
Milan is taking over the game.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.200
Watch out, the game is changing.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.160
Turn around, you're closed!

32:28.280 --> 32:29.200
Chiesa!

32:30.880 --> 32:33.680
There he goes, Dybala,
back-heel for Chiesa, here we go!

32:36.480 --> 32:41.280
Chiesa! 1-0 for Juve!

32:43.840 --> 32:44.680
Great!

32:47.640 --> 32:50.640
I told you he'd be on fire tonight!

32:51.880 --> 32:53.800
Great game here in San Siro.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.160
Attack!

32:58.040 --> 32:59.480
Chiesa on the other side.

33:01.040 --> 33:04.280
Chiesa always looks dangerous
with the ball.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.080
Chiesa is fucking on tonight.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.360
Nice, Fede.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.280
Leo, here it comes!

33:14.360 --> 33:15.920
Bonucci goes back.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.080
Go!

33:22.440 --> 33:26.320
No! Where's the whistle?

33:26.400 --> 33:28.000
The referee says it's okay.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.680
Milan 1, Juve 1. Calabria's goal.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.040
Oh, my goodness!

33:49.560 --> 33:50.680
Calm down!

33:52.720 --> 33:57.040
The Turk again, Hauge on his back,
Çalhanoğlu, low shot for Dalot.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.640
Don't let him shoot!

33:58.720 --> 34:01.640
Here comes Dalot,
it's Dalot with his right. Szczęsny!

34:01.760 --> 34:07.240
Another amazing intervention
for Juve's goalkeeper, this time on Dalot.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.160
Paulo Dybala gets the ball.
A cross for CR7.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.440
Frabotta.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.000
Good idea for Dybala.
Lots of space. Dybala.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.800
Chiesa gets it.
He goes for the goal. Chiesa!

34:25.000 --> 34:28.320
Chiesa! Juventus takes the lead!

34:29.000 --> 34:29.920
Go, Fede!

34:37.840 --> 34:40.120
Wait. Let's put Wes in.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.480
Wes with... Wait.

34:43.040 --> 34:43.960
Wait a second.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.880
Weston McKennie replaces Paulo Dybala.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.840
Chiesa out, Kulusevski in.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.960
Andrea Pirlo sends fresh players in
at the right time.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.360
Come on, Wes! Go!

35:10.280 --> 35:11.400
McKennie!

35:18.960 --> 35:23.120
The game is over! Milan 1, Juventus 3!

35:30.760 --> 35:33.640
It was an important game.

35:33.680 --> 35:37.200
We had to gain points, a lot of points,

35:37.320 --> 35:40.160
we couldn't afford to lose any,

35:40.280 --> 35:43.360
so we did what we had to do.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.320
We played as a team,

35:45.400 --> 35:49.960
with that sense of belonging and will
that distinguishes Juve.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.440
Yesterday showed

36:00.520 --> 36:03.600
how great Juve's bench is,

36:03.640 --> 36:08.200
and Juve showed how great they can be,
especially in this kind of game.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.640
Yesterday, Juve said,
"We are back, we are here,

36:12.000 --> 36:16.320
"we haven't given up," and now
the other teams will feel the pressure.

36:22.920 --> 36:26.640
Pirlo had the guts
to let the youngest play,

36:27.560 --> 36:31.120
to bet on them during an emergency,

36:31.440 --> 36:36.080
without changing the roles of the seniors

36:36.160 --> 36:38.160
just to have them on the field.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.560
That's very interesting

36:40.640 --> 36:45.360
and it's brave for a first-time coach,

36:45.880 --> 36:49.640
who would typically
tend to be more cautious.

36:49.800 --> 36:53.120
He had the guts
and he trusted the youngsters.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.840
This trust was proven fruitful

36:56.920 --> 36:58.800
thanks to the seniors as well.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.080
But it wasn't the only positive outcome
of this game.

37:04.960 --> 37:05.840
Come on!

37:06.800 --> 37:10.160
I will never deny what I have done.

37:10.200 --> 37:14.560
I've always been the first
to own up to it. In that moment,

37:15.640 --> 37:19.160
the best thing for everyone
was for me to leave,

37:19.200 --> 37:21.000
but, as it often happens,

37:21.080 --> 37:24.280
when love is strong,
there's an opening for reconciliation.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.640
In a game where they were the underdogs,

37:27.800 --> 37:31.560
the Bianconeri, thanks to a combination
of experienced senior players

37:31.640 --> 37:35.480
and exuberant young players,
achieved a memorable outcome.

37:36.320 --> 37:40.280
Juventus is still in the race
for the scudetto.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.640
Tonight, Inter faces off with Juventus.

38:02.120 --> 38:05.560
McKennie... Penalty for Naples.
This is the Italian Super Cup!

38:05.640 --> 38:07.840
May the best team win!
