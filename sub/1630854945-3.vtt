you spent

10:54.550 --> 10:56.850
one too many days in a row
inside this school.

10:57.050 --> 11:00.220
Is there another option?

11:00.420 --> 11:02.520
There is, actually.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.560
Gang, I know it's not usually
for another month or so,

11:05.760 --> 11:08.860
but time is relative here,
is it not?

11:09.060 --> 11:11.600
So what do you say?
Who's up for another field day?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.140
Yes! Hell yes!

11:13.330 --> 11:15.400
Yes. Yes. Field day. Let's go.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.670
Please kill me.

I love you, Mr. M.

Everybody needs exercise.

we ghosts occasionally need

11:23.410 --> 11:25.920
to "exorcise" a few demons too.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.180
- Mm-mm.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.190

I don't do sports.

Well, Maddie, I hear you,

11:34.720 --> 11:36.530

11:36.720 --> 11:38.490
I am going to choose
not to be offended by that.

lots and lots of Spandex?

- Yes, there were because
they were fricking heroes.

11:59.350 --> 12:01.950
And they're my personal
inspiration for field day.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.790
Leave her alone, you guys.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.220
She doesn't want
to play tug of war

12:05.420 --> 12:08.260

ex-boyfriend limb from limb.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.830

12:14.030 --> 12:15.400
Do tell.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.700
Who do we have
in our crosshairs now?

12:19.900 --> 12:22.370
- So I was writing this essay
about my 81-year-old grandma--

12:22.570 --> 12:23.910
her name's Juana Alcantara--

an Oxford comma, or--

12:48.660 --> 12:50.400
All of them can be answered
in "The Elements of Style,"

12:50.600 --> 12:51.870

14:59.590 --> 15:01.400
More importantly,
tell me what happened.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.870
- My mom said she was hungry,
so I took a shortcut

His fricking glove box.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.630
- Yeah, you broke into his car.
I saw you.

15:37.830 --> 15:39.940
- Not technically,
and not the point.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.670
Actually, kind of is, Simon.

15:41.870 --> 15:43.170
- Why would you do that?
- Why not?

15:43.370 --> 15:45.010
I told you I had a feeling
about him, and I was right.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.310
- And I told you
I would watch him.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.910
Who cares who's watching him?

15:48.110 --> 15:50.150
Maddie, he's holding on
to a piece of evidence.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.410
Now he might be
tampering with it,

15:51.610 --> 15:52.750
maybe even trying
to get rid of it.

another reason.

15:59.420 --> 16:00.520
Sure. Yeah.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.360
Maybe he's saving it
as a trophy for his kill.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.490
Maybe he's gonna smelt it
into a frickin' ring.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.260
Maddie, he's hiding something.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.660
No. He can't be.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.670
You'll see.

31:20.870 --> 31:22.310
Right.

31:27.410 --> 31:32.450
I--I was wondering

31:32.650 --> 31:36.160
what the story was between you
and your guidance counselor.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.530
I'm just curious.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.960
- Why, so you can
blog about it?

31:40.160 --> 31:42.100
- Blogs aren't really
a thing anymore, just--

31:42.300 --> 31:44.730
they--they take
too long to read.

31:44.930 --> 31:47.940
Of course they do.

31:48.140 --> 31:52.510
- I was more just wanting
to get some answers.

31:54.740 --> 31:56.680
My pain is not for sale.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.180
- No, I know that. I just--

31:59.380 --> 32:01.620
- You think my death can
somehow help you solve yours?

32:01.820 --> 32:03.150
Honestly, I hope not.

32:07.690 --> 32:12.260
I just--I had a friendship
with a teacher too.

32:12.460 --> 32:15.260
I guess I'm just trying
to figure out

32:15.460 --> 32:17.030
what it all meant.

32:27.340 --> 32:31.450
- Mr. Manfredo was
the nicest man I'd ever met.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.950
My father was a pencil pusher.

32:34.150 --> 32:36.320
Long hours, never home.

32:36.520 --> 32:40.860
And my mother cared more
about how that home looked--

32:41.050 --> 32:44.560
the lawn, the stupid roses.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.700
But Mr. Manfredo,

32:48.900 --> 32:52.270
he just cared about me.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.670
That sounds nice.

32:53.870 --> 32:56.700
And it was.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.840
He saw that I was
something special.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.880
He wrote to fancy schools
to let them know it too.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.110
If I had a grade that slipped,
he was firm.

33:04.310 --> 33:06.310
He knew what it took to succeed
out in the real world,

33:06.510 --> 33:11.090
and he wanted me
to see that world someday.

33:12.550 --> 33:15.660
But then when my dream,
or our dream,

33:15.860 --> 33:18.030
became a reality...

33:20.130 --> 33:22.400
It all went sideways.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.030
How so?

33:27.800 --> 33:28.970
- I was in his office
showing him

33:29.170 --> 33:33.310
my acceptance letter
to Berkeley, and...

33:33.510 --> 33:35.310
he just shut down.

33:37.840 --> 33:41.050
And that's when it became clear
that all that kindness,

33:41.250 --> 33:45.150
all that guidance
came with a cost.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.460
What?

33:50.660 --> 33:51.930
What happened?

33:53.660 --> 33:55.900
We argued.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.600
He thought we were one thing.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.400
I...disagreed,

34:01.600 --> 34:06.510
and then when I went
to leave his office...

34:06.710 --> 34:08.580
let's just say I never left.

34:10.080 --> 34:14.150
Turns out nobody's who
you think they are, cherry pop.

34:14.350 --> 34:16.250
If I got any lasting advice

34:16.450 --> 34:19.450
from my so-called
guidance counselor, it's that.

34:19.650 --> 34:20.850
So he was never caught?

34:21.050 --> 34:22.860
No, he was.

34:23.060 --> 34:26.160
He died in prison.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.960
That didn't change anything
for me.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.270
Nothing ever changes here.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.530
It all just resets in the end.

This room and Ms. Field's room.

35:35.660 --> 35:37.170
They used to be the old
guidance counselor's office.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.200
- How is that possible?
- Well, they put this wall up.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.470
They split the room in two
after Rhonda was killed.

35:42.670 --> 35:45.840
- Hang on.
Other kids were killed here?

35:46.040 --> 35:47.610
We don't have time for that.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.810
And Rhonda's death is why
we can talk in this classroom.

35:51.010 --> 35:52.250

35:52.450 --> 35:54.080
It's why we can talk
in those places too.

Simon, we can talk
anywhere that someone has died.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.920
The scars of the school.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.320
Mr. South talked to me
the other day.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.860
He said
that the school had scars.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.060
I guess maybe that was
what he meant.

to each other?

36:19.570 --> 36:22.580
I'm gonna say that I'm sorry

and that I shouldn't have
pushed you away earlier.

36:25.140 --> 36:26.550

36:26.750 --> 36:29.120
And...

36:29.320 --> 36:33.420
that I think you may be right.

36:33.620 --> 36:34.690
Mm.

36:34.890 --> 36:37.330
Say more about this

36:37.520 --> 36:39.790
It hasn't been easy, okay,

36:39.990 --> 36:43.100
to look at everyone in my life
and pick them apart.

36:43.300 --> 36:46.270
But I'm willing to admit

36:46.470 --> 36:49.470
that I might have had
a blind spot to Mr. Anderson.

36:49.670 --> 36:50.800
Thank you.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.510
- And, Simon, if he really is
hiding something,

36:53.710 --> 36:57.280
then this classroom might be
our last place to look.

36:57.480 --> 37:01.880
And I can't do this
without you, Simon.
