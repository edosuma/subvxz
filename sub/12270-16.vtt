Terrible magic took Bella away.

00:05.480 --> 00:09.120
Become Bella, get Cameron
to fall for her, he could bring her back.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.280
(TARA) All it needs is a kiss.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.320
Bella! You're okay.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.640
-You're releasing The Founders.
-Give us three fated villagers to inhabit.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.480
-(LACIE) Where is the third?
-Let it happen, fated one.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.360
# I left my friends for my new life #

00:29.480 --> 00:32.320
# How will I know it's gonna be alright? #

00:32.480 --> 00:35.480
# I got to take control #

00:35.600 --> 00:39.160
# And write my destiny #

00:39.360 --> 00:44.560
# The future's still untold
Nobody else can see #

00:44.760 --> 00:50.440

It’s worked!

My sisters...

01:20.640 --> 01:22.600
Something...

01:22.800 --> 01:24.760
Something is wrong.

(SORSHA'S OWN VOICE)
Get out!

01:27.760 --> 01:30.480
Get out of my head!
(GASPING)

01:32.000 --> 01:33.600
Come back with my sister!

01:39.000 --> 01:42.600
There is only one possible way:

01:42.800 --> 01:45.600
she is protected by love.

(IN SPOOKY VOICE)
I am the Founder.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.840
I command you to touch the Lantern.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.400
-That’s Mr. Floppy Ears.
-Use your imagination.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.480
Come on Bella, try and remember.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.080
(BELLA SIGHS)

02:05.280 --> 02:09.400
(IN SPOOKY VOICE)
Touch the Lantern, Bella.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.080
Okay, I remember...

02:12.280 --> 02:16.040
A nose.
Yeah, the person definitely had a nose.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.640
Bella. The Founders are controlling
two people and only you can say who.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.000
I’m trying, I’m trying! Right, okay.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.640
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
I’m seeing hair.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.840
Good. This is good.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.160
It’s soft, dark.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.600
Extremely nice
to run your fingers through.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.360
You’re thinking about Cameron again,
aren’t you.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.960
My thoughts just wander in that direction.

02:42.080 --> 02:47.640
I realize there’s a threat to everyone
and everything but, you know, dimples!

02:47.840 --> 02:50.360
Bella, you ready for school?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.520
You’re really okay with this?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.280
I think we’re through here.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.640
(JAKE) What’s with you and Sorsha?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.360
She’s got her Circle.
I’ve got the science fair.

Ah, Seb. I am the exhibition’s
visual display engineer.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.920
What’s that mean?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.160
I set out the tables.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.080
I’ve got you a good one in between
the toad-charmer and the monkey hypnotist.

03:40.280 --> 03:47.000
Oh, no, it’s gone again. Here, boy!
(MONKEY SCREECH)

03:47.120 --> 03:51.120
-This is a magic show.
-You’re not kidding.

03:51.320 --> 03:55.760
They’ve even magicked up Evermoorian food
so that it doesn’t smell of toecheese.

That is the Stew of True!

04:05.120 --> 04:08.960
A traditional family broth
that compels you to tell the truth.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.800
Your science project... is soup?

04:11.960 --> 04:15.480
If you lie, your head shrinks
to the size of a pea!

04:15.640 --> 04:16.840
Are you crazy?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.680
That’s something parents say
to make kids behave.

04:19.880 --> 04:25.160
And you’re sure of that?
Are you prepared to take the chance?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.280
You must tell the truth, all day.

04:29.440 --> 04:34.000
Otherwise, get used to having a pea head.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.400
Why can’t I remember anything?

Sorsha... Sorsha.

(SORSHA)
Who’s that? Where are you?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.040
(FOUNDER)
Only you can hear me, Sorsha.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.000
You must conceal that hand.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.400
(SORSHA)
Quiet! Be quiet!

04:56.480 --> 04:59.800
Hey. Your cloak.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.840
You’re back in the Circle?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.800
Yes. I think. I don’t know.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.440
Hey, are you-- what’s that?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.400
(FOUNDER)
I told you to hide it!

05:11.520 --> 05:14.920
(FOUNDER)
Let me take over, it will be much easier!

05:15.040 --> 05:20.320
I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

05:22.520 --> 05:26.400
Observation: the bog is made up of
an unusual mix of elements.

05:26.520 --> 05:32.440
So you’re saying that the shape
of the glass bends the light waves?

05:32.560 --> 05:38.200
Oh, please! This is a science fair.
Take it away.

05:39.560 --> 05:44.800
Observation: there is not one person
in Evermoor even remotely like...

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
...me.

Chemistry!

05:50.320 --> 05:51.360
Yeah.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.080
Actual serious chemistry.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.320
Yes.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.440
Yes, it is.

-I’m Seb.
-No way! I’m Seb!

06:16.840 --> 06:18.400
Huh?

06:18.520 --> 06:21.360
Short for Sebastienne.
(CHUCKLES)

06:21.480 --> 06:23.080
What are the chances?

06:26.160 --> 06:30.360
All you have to do is be honest.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.840
How hard can it be?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.360
Uh-oh, Doyle. And we’re super-late.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.160
(DOYLE)
You two.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.040
I hope you’ve got a good excuse.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.480
Mr. Doyle, it is totally not our fault
that we’re late.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.920
We had to stop, actually, yeah,
to help a squirrel give birth.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.200
It was amazing. I don’t think
I’m ever gonna forget it, no.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.000
Ask him.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.000
Is this true?

06:59.120 --> 07:00.160
(STAMMERING)

07:00.360 --> 07:01.960
Yeah...

07:04.000 --> 07:06.120
They’re obsessed with each other.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.200
Too sappy to notice the time.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.960
Lunchtime detention un-gumming tables.
Both of you.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.080
I guess you’re going to find out
what a bed full of dried gum looks like.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.840
Thank you for your honesty,
young Crossley.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.800
Maybe you’re finally becoming
a responsible Evermoorian.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.080
In fact,
I’ll give you the chance to prove it.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.880
Give the closing speech
at the science fair.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Me?

07:35.160 --> 07:38.680
All you have to do is
say a few nice things about the exhibits.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.520
What could be easier?

07:49.160 --> 07:52.560
(BUZZING)

07:52.760 --> 07:56.160
Amazing. The first not insane thing
I’ve seen since I arrived.

07:56.360 --> 08:00.400
I have to constantly pretend
this place isn’t ridiculous.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.400
(BOTH GIGGLE)

08:03.480 --> 08:07.000
Obviously, by "completely ridiculous"
I mean "entirely normal".

08:07.120 --> 08:09.960
-Can we talk?
-Be right back.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.840
Well done, you two!

08:13.000 --> 08:16.760
I never expected a scientist
and an Everine to be a couple!

08:16.920 --> 08:19.160
People think you have nothing in common!

08:19.320 --> 08:21.160
(SORSHA)
Well, they’d be wrong.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.240
Seb’s exhibit is obviously about...

08:24.400 --> 08:27.560
well, about why the bogmud has--

08:27.720 --> 08:29.760
If its unusual mix of oxygen,

08:29.920 --> 08:33.880
nitrogen and minerals are
the unique ecosystem they appear to be.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.800
That’s what I was going to say.

08:36.960 --> 08:42.000
Oh, Seb! Look at this! The microbes
in this mud are off the scale!

08:42.120 --> 08:45.080
Wow!
It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.

08:47.320 --> 08:51.040
(FOUNDER)
Sorsha! I’m getting stronger!

08:53.240 --> 08:58.080
Hey! You know the only person who’s run
away from me that fast lately is Cameron.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.560
What’s gotten into you?

09:00.720 --> 09:06.760
(CREEPY MUSIC PLAYING)

09:06.920 --> 09:10.120
(GASP)
A Founder.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.560
That’s what’s gotten into you!

09:19.680 --> 09:25.000
Welcome. You're just in time for the
turning cheese into gold demonstration.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.560
(STATIC CRACKLING)

09:27.720 --> 09:30.760
Look at these readings, Seb.
If my eco-detector is right--

09:30.920 --> 09:33.360
-Your what?
-I’m also researching bogmud.

09:33.560 --> 09:37.000
-You’re doing the same experiment?
-Did I not mention it?

09:37.120 --> 09:39.000
Anyway, if this is right, then--

09:39.160 --> 09:43.080
Then the bog is some kind of ecosystem
totally unknown to science!

09:43.240 --> 09:44.320
Oh. (GASPS)

09:45.560 --> 09:47.640
-Sorry.
-No need to be.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.360
Your girlfriend’s not here,
if that’s your worry.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.320
-This isn’t her kind of thing, is it?
-Oh, stop.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.920
You nearly trod on it.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.920
These guys get such a bad press.

10:01.040 --> 10:06.000
One of the most misunderstood creatures
on the planet. Don’t you think?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.440
There you go, little fella.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.280
Seb! There’s something wrong with Sorsha.
A whole bog full of wrong.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.240
-Huh? Where is she?
-Wait. I need to explain.

10:17.400 --> 10:22.160
(URGENT BACKGROUND MUSIC PLAYING)

10:31.000 --> 10:35.360
Did I miss the part where humans started
spinning webs?

10:36.680 --> 10:39.000
(FOUNDER)
Your protection is fading, Sorsha!

10:39.120 --> 10:41.360
-Go away!
-Oh, that’s nice.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.120
-No, I--
-Back in the Circle,

10:43.280 --> 10:46.960
-but you don’t like my science friends.
-No! That’s not it!

10:47.080 --> 10:51.320
So caught up with your stupid science
you can’t see what magic’s doing!

10:52.440 --> 10:53.680
It’s not stupid!

10:54.680 --> 10:56.000
Seb, wait.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.760
-Tara, we have a problem.
-I know!

10:59.920 --> 11:02.720
-The third Founder’s gone into Sorsha.
-What?

11:02.880 --> 11:04.520
I saw it in her reflection.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.040
Okay. That means she’s fighting it.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.040
Seb and Sorsha’s feelings
must be holding it back.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.200
Great, one break-up away from doom?
With that science cutie hanging around?

11:15.360 --> 11:18.200
I’m not sure she’s as cute as she seems.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.640
In school we don’t know each other.
What do you want?

11:24.800 --> 11:27.600
I’m not sure I can complete my task.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.400
We gave you human form.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.000
Don't want to go back being a spider,
do you?

11:32.160 --> 11:33.520
No, of course not.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.000
So, make him fall for you.
It’s simple, eight legs!

11:37.120 --> 11:39.440
Seb seems like a nice guy.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.400
He doesn’t deserve this.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.200
Spiders trap their prey.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.600
Get spidering.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.960
If I can’t draw him away from Sorsha?

11:49.080 --> 11:52.640
Then you’d better think of another way
to get rid of him.

I do not want to meet the bug
that came out of that.

You already have.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.640
(WET SQUISHING)

12:26.440 --> 12:29.160
Doesn’t that girl have a lot in common
with Seb?

12:29.320 --> 12:32.000
Almost like... they modeled her on him.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.760
Modeled her?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.240
This is a Founder ritual.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.840
I heard rumors in the old days,
but I never saw it for myself before...

12:40.000 --> 12:41.800
Saw what, Otto?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.440
I think they turned their spider
into a human.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.120
A human just like Seb.
Literally made for him.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.800
You’re telling me Seb’s dream girl
is a female version of himself?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.560
-I'm not surprised.
-Better hope they’re wrong.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.880
Because if she makes him forget
about Sorsha...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.600
it’s game over.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.360
(MENACING BACKGROUND MUSIC PLAYING)

-You’re not eating?
-I’m saving room for dessert.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.200
I’m so pleased you had no lunch plans!

13:13.360 --> 13:17.160
-Usually I eat with Sorsha...
-Things aren’t going so well?

13:19.160 --> 13:23.560
I want her to have what she wants.
I know I can’t be with her now.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.800
At least, my brain knows that.
I’m not sure my heart does.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.600
Maybe you’ve just outgrown each other.

13:30.760 --> 13:35.000
Maybe you need someone with more legs--
um, more in common.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.400
Maybe you’re right.
It’s good that you’re here.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.080
Someone who’s actually on my wavelength
at last.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.520
I... I can’t.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.240
-Forget her. She’s in the Circle.
-It doesn’t change the way I feel.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.640
Seb, listen to me.
You’d be a whole lot better off with me.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.200
-You have no idea how much better off.
-That’s probably true.

13:57.360 --> 14:01.000
I mean, it makes scientific sense.
But me and Sorsha that’s...

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
That’s magic.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.880
We should get back.
We need to finish our project.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.160
Sounds great.

14:15.200 --> 14:19.040
Soon, my Sister. Soon.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.520
SCIENCE FAIR

14:22.680 --> 14:26.080
Um, I thought you said your experiment
was in here.

14:26.240 --> 14:31.080
Sorry, Seb. When I invited you to lunch...
I forgot to tell you that...

14:33.600 --> 14:37.360
You’re the lunch.
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

14:37.560 --> 14:39.200
(STATIC CRACKLES)

14:39.360 --> 14:41.200
A worthy winner, you’ll agree.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.200
(CROWD APPLAUDS)

14:43.360 --> 14:47.920
Everything they know about science is
down to you, Mayor Doyle!

14:48.040 --> 14:51.280
(FOUNDER)
Let me in. Let me in, Everine.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.160
(FOUNDER)
Your defenses are almost gone!

14:54.320 --> 14:56.960
Sorsha? You okay?

14:57.080 --> 14:59.840
-Where’s Seb?
-Ask his new friend.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.640
We’re going to be asking her
a lot of things.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.880
Like if she’s climbed up
any waterspouts lately. Come on!

15:06.000 --> 15:07.720
EVERMOOR SCIENCE FAIR

15:07.880 --> 15:12.280
It only remains for me to hand over
to Jake Crossley,

15:12.440 --> 15:16.840
who will give the closing speech
on my behalf. (APPLAUDS)

15:17.000 --> 15:20.120
I can’t do this.
I may literally lose my head!

15:20.280 --> 15:23.960
It’s fine. Just make sure you don’t lie.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.840
Say what you really think!

15:33.840 --> 15:38.200
When Mayor Doyle asked me
to give this speech,

15:38.360 --> 15:40.400
I honestly thought...

15:42.320 --> 15:44.120
(GULPS)

15:44.280 --> 15:45.560
Lame!
(CROWD GASPS)

15:45.720 --> 15:48.360
The water diviner, made up nonsense.

15:48.560 --> 15:52.280
The escape guy,
you couldn’t even escape an open door.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.600
And this guy is going to represent
Evermoor in the Finals,

15:55.760 --> 15:58.200
show the whole nation
how nutso you all are?

15:58.360 --> 15:59.760
Detention for a month!

15:59.920 --> 16:01.600
I’d say it deserves two.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.600
Fine! Two!

16:03.760 --> 16:05.080
(LUDO SLURPS)

16:07.160 --> 16:09.960
Well, at least I still have my head.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.200
Well, you did great.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.760
Say that again.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.200
It was a truly great speech.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.640
Are you eating stew?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.000
Starving.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.520
But... you must have lied.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.040
You can’t honestly think I did great.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.880
I guess you’re right.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.520
Maybe it doesn’t make your head shrink!
Ha! Who knew?

16:28.680 --> 16:31.760
You know what, Ludo?

16:31.920 --> 16:34.840
You are the greatest friend
any boy could ask for.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.120
You make me glad to live in Evermoor!

16:42.400 --> 16:45.000
He’s just being honest.
(CHUCKLES)

16:46.160 --> 16:49.160
Falling for you wasn’t part of the plan,
Seb.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.760
I don’t know if I’ll ever get over you.

16:51.920 --> 16:56.080
But I guess eating you
might help me get closure.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.880
(SEB)
Tara, please help. Tara.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.440
Hey!

17:00.640 --> 17:04.840
One problem with spiders.
They leave web everywhere.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.600
What have you done to him?

17:06.760 --> 17:09.560
-Leave him alone.
-No way. They’ll change me back.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.360
I’m not going to be a spider again.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.920
Look! Give in.

17:18.040 --> 17:22.720
Free Seb to be with someone else,
he’ll forget you, then she’ll take over.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.960
Then I’ll free him!

17:25.080 --> 17:28.360
(FOUNDER)
Yes, Sorsha. Do it, do it!

17:28.560 --> 17:32.760
(FOUNDER)
That’s it. Save him! Let go!

17:32.920 --> 17:38.680
(SORSHA'S OWN VOICE)
That’s... that’s never going to happen.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.520
(CLATTERS)

17:41.680 --> 17:46.680
And as for you, eight legs,
you’d better run.

17:46.840 --> 17:52.080
Unless you want to be squished
like the insect you are.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.720
Technically a spider is not an insect.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.600
-I know that, Otto!
-I’m not afraid of half a Founder.

17:58.760 --> 18:04.640
How about half a Founder, a Supreme
and a demigod, spider-eating owl?

18:04.800 --> 18:06.280
(INHALES SHARPLY)

18:06.440 --> 18:07.920
Ex-Supreme.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.640
Demigod with no powers.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.440
Where’d she go?

18:15.520 --> 18:16.840
There!

18:22.880 --> 18:26.360
(ESMERELDA)
Bad, bad, spider.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.440
Esmerelda and Lacie. It’s them.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.800
They’re the Founders!

18:37.800 --> 18:39.600
I won’t lie to you.

18:39.760 --> 18:44.840
I need to be honest
so we can move forward. Sorsha...

18:45.000 --> 18:48.440
-I kissed Sebastienne.
-No! No! You can’t tell her that.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.440
I can’t have it on my conscience,
even if we break up.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.920
-(OTTO) Not a good idea.
-(TARA) Nothing to be gained from it.

18:55.040 --> 18:59.040
-You were led astray.
-You did nothing wrong.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.360
You really want us to stay together.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.120
(BOTH)
Yes!

19:03.280 --> 19:07.760
Guess it’s totally natural to have
your head turned by a pretty spider.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.280
Why don’t you go check if Sorsha’s okay?

19:10.440 --> 19:13.360
Sure. And...

19:17.080 --> 19:19.160
(SIGHS)

19:19.320 --> 19:23.520
I think we deserve some shakes.
You want a rodent in yours, owl boy?

19:23.680 --> 19:26.240
Maybe we should save the celebration.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.000
We’re the only ones who know
what Esmerelda and Lacie really are.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.000
Which means...

19:32.120 --> 19:35.000
The fate of the world depends on
you and me.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.120
(DRAMATIC BACKGROUND MUSIC PLAYING)

19:38.280 --> 19:40.960
Oh, sweet Veronica.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.920
Seems we must raise our game.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.000
And get rid of the boy for good.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.760
You don’t mean...

19:52.920 --> 19:55.560
It’s time for the summoning.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.640
What? No.

-What is that?
-(ESMERELDA) When Hollowfall rises,

20:44.600 --> 20:48.080
a champion must be sent from Evermoor
to foster peace.

20:48.240 --> 20:51.720
Anyone who volunteers is
simply a sacrifice.
