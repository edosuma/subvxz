WEBVTT

00:16.214 --> 00:20.585
I am here to discuss the
so-called flying saucers.

00:21.285 --> 00:23.922
Air force interest
in this problem

00:23.956 --> 00:26.625
has been due to our feeling
of an obligation

00:26.657 --> 00:31.896
to identify and analyze
to the best of our ability

00:31.930 --> 00:33.698
<i>anything in the air</i>

00:33.732 --> 00:36.634
<i>that may have the possibility
of threat</i>

00:36.668 --> 00:38.704
<i>or menace to the United States.</i>

00:38.737 --> 00:42.975
In pursuit of this obligation
since 1947,

00:43.007 --> 00:47.979
<i>we have received and analyzed
between 1,000 and 2,000 reports</i>

00:48.012 --> 00:51.683
that have come to us
from all kinds of sources.

00:51.717 --> 00:54.085
We can say that
the recent sightings

00:54.119 --> 00:56.555
<i>are in no way connected</i>

00:56.588 --> 00:58.256
<i>with any secret development</i>

00:58.290 --> 01:01.560
<i>by any department
of the United States.</i>

01:01.592 --> 01:03.928
<i>Major keyhoe,
as author of the book</i>

01:03.961 --> 01:05.430
flying saucers are real,

01:05.463 --> 01:10.235
<i>what is your opinion of these new
sightings of unidentified objects?</i>

01:10.268 --> 01:11.713
With all due respect
to the air force,

01:11.737 --> 01:13.872
I believe that some of them
will prove to be

01:13.906 --> 01:15.640
of interplanetary origin.

01:15.674 --> 01:17.142
During a three-year
investigation,

01:17.175 --> 01:18.878
I found that many pilots

01:18.910 --> 01:21.980
have described objects
of substance and high speed.

01:22.014 --> 01:24.750
<i>One case, pilots reported
their plane was buffeted</i>

01:24.782 --> 01:27.585
<i>by an object which passed
them at 500 miles an hour.</i>

01:27.618 --> 01:31.556
Obviously, this was a solid object
and I believe it was from outer space.

01:47.271 --> 01:50.008
<i>♪ ...liberace, I love you ♪</i>

01:50.041 --> 01:51.743
<i>♪ take a peach, take a plum</i>

01:51.776 --> 01:53.244
<i>♪ take a stick of bubble gum</i>

01:53.278 --> 01:54.680
<i>♪ no peach, no plum
no stick of gum</i>

01:54.713 --> 01:57.750
- <i>♪ saw you with your boyfriend... ♪</i>
- Girls, dinner's ready.

01:57.782 --> 01:58.784
Mom.

01:59.451 --> 02:01.287
Let's take it

02:01.320 --> 02:03.589
<i>♪ Eenie meanie sassaleeny</i>

<i>♪ saw you with your

02:19.938 --> 02:21.707
dinner's ready.

02:24.943 --> 02:26.077
I know your boyfriend.

02:27.746 --> 02:29.881
Saw you with your boyfriend.

02:30.716 --> 02:32.585
Wait, what night is it?

02:32.617 --> 02:35.587
It's the boring chickpea
Tuesday night.

02:37.321 --> 02:39.091
You girls be grateful now.

02:40.926 --> 02:44.696
Did you know there's 168 million
child laborers in the world?

02:44.730 --> 02:46.074
Some carry books on their head
all day

02:46.098 --> 02:48.166
in 100 degree heat
for a can of chickpeas.

02:49.033 --> 02:51.135
And they're considered
the lucky ones.

02:51.169 --> 02:52.605
Is that true?

02:53.105 --> 02:54.707
Momma says so.

03:00.979 --> 03:02.014
God is great.

03:02.046 --> 03:03.147
God is good.

03:03.181 --> 03:05.217
Let us thank him for our food.

03:05.249 --> 03:07.885
By his hands we all are fed.

03:07.919 --> 03:09.955
Give us lord our daily bread.

03:09.987 --> 03:11.022
Amen.

03:14.058 --> 03:15.360
What happened?

03:17.996 --> 03:18.998
Dad!

03:23.068 --> 03:24.103
Dad!

03:42.287 --> 03:45.256
Rob?

03:49.326 --> 03:52.163
Oh, oh, lord.

03:52.196 --> 03:53.199
Help me, Jesus.

03:54.131 --> 03:55.134
Valerie?

03:56.100 --> 03:57.770
Val?

03:57.802 --> 03:59.671
Valerie, honey.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.273
Oh.

04:01.306 --> 04:03.975
Valerie. Honey, wake up.

04:06.944 --> 04:07.946
Okay?

04:09.848 --> 04:10.850
Sarah?

04:16.053 --> 04:19.157
Oh, honey, come on.
Give mommy your hand.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.392
Come on, it's over.

04:21.426 --> 04:23.195
It's over. It's all over.

04:23.928 --> 04:24.929
It's all over.

04:27.065 --> 04:28.234
Oh!

04:36.073 --> 04:37.275
Baby.

04:50.354 --> 04:51.924
Looks like a plane crash.

04:51.957 --> 04:53.224
It was a terrorist attack.

04:53.758 --> 04:55.760
It's not a terrorist attack.

04:59.097 --> 05:00.231
What's happening?

05:03.200 --> 05:05.070
Get away from the window.

05:05.102 --> 05:06.905
What?

05:07.272 --> 05:09.040
The air is toxic.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.750
Mom?

05:17.782 --> 05:19.718
Honey. Rob?

05:24.989 --> 05:26.725
Help me, Jesus.

05:28.493 --> 05:30.094
Rob, please!

05:30.962 --> 05:32.363
No, no.

05:32.397 --> 05:33.365
No.

05:33.397 --> 05:36.801
God damn it, please don't
do this to me, Rob.

05:40.938 --> 05:43.742
What's happening?

05:44.508 --> 05:47.912
Rob!

07:10.594 --> 07:13.164
<i>Look, Phoenix is a good team.</i>

07:13.198 --> 07:15.334
<i>But the last three minutes
of the game,</i>

07:15.366 --> 07:17.068
<i>they did it again.</i>

07:17.101 --> 07:19.037
<i>This could have been
the game of the century.</i>

07:19.070 --> 07:20.339
<i>I mean, they had it all.</i>

07:20.371 --> 07:22.540
<i>I have a lot of respect
for David quaid though.</i>

07:22.573 --> 07:24.017
<i>I think he's made
a remarkable comeback.</i>

07:24.041 --> 07:26.945
<i>Okay, I see what you're
saying, but I'll leave you with this.</i>

07:26.977 --> 07:29.080
<i>They generate twice
as much revenue in sponsorship</i>

07:29.113 --> 07:31.315
<i>than any other
NFL team out there.</i>

07:31.349 --> 07:33.318
<i>All right, see you tomorrow.</i>

07:33.351 --> 07:34.386
<i>Back to you, Marcus.</i>

07:34.419 --> 07:37.322
<i>Now to a dire warning
about climate change.</i>

07:37.354 --> 07:38.522
<i>According to a new report,</i>

07:38.556 --> 07:41.960
<i>experts say that we have until
2030 to avoid catastrophe.</i>

07:41.993 --> 07:42.961
<i>Report also says that if</i>

07:42.993 --> 07:45.097
<i>unprecedented changes
aren't made soon,</i>

07:45.130 --> 07:48.065
<i>there'll be dire consequences
for the planet.</i>

07:48.099 --> 07:49.210
<i>The report focuses
on what could happen</i>

07:49.234 --> 07:53.404
<i>if global temperatures rise by
2.7 degrees fahrenheit.</i>

07:53.438 --> 07:54.606
<i>CNN meteorologist Geoff Smith</i>

07:54.638 --> 07:55.883
<i>is at the international
weather center.</i>

07:55.907 --> 07:59.277
<i>Geoff, what can you tell us
about this serious warning?</i>

07:59.311 --> 08:02.147
<i>Well, 2030, uh,
getting pretty close.</i>

08:02.179 --> 08:03.657
<i>And, of course, we're seeing
that climate change</i>

08:03.681 --> 08:05.683
<i>is already taking its toll
on the planet.</i>

08:05.717 --> 08:09.121
<i>I mean, let's talk about
2016, '17, '18,</i>

08:09.154 --> 08:11.023
<i>the three hottest years
on record.</i>

08:11.056 --> 08:12.524
<i>During this time,
the polar ice caps</i>

08:12.556 --> 08:13.724
<i>really started to melt...</i>

08:13.758 --> 08:17.428
<i>Uh, I'm going to have to
interrupt you there, Geoff.</i>

08:17.462 --> 08:19.231
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

08:19.263 --> 08:22.266
<i>We're getting breaking news
at this hour.</i>

08:22.299 --> 08:24.635
<i>Breaking news
of a massive explosion</i>

08:24.669 --> 08:26.204
<i>in the town of badger,</i>

08:26.236 --> 08:28.539
<i>which is a small community
of 1,300 people</i>

08:28.573 --> 08:30.275
<i>in northern Pennsylvania.</i>

08:30.308 --> 08:32.277
<i>There have been casualties,
many,</i>

08:32.310 --> 08:34.546
<i>but the exact numbers
are not known at this stage</i>

08:34.578 --> 08:36.981
<i>and the Pentagon
is yet to clarify</i>

08:37.015 --> 08:39.284
<i>whether this has been
an act of terrorism</i>

08:39.317 --> 08:40.652
<i>or a natural disaster.</i>

08:40.684 --> 08:43.054
<i>Our reporter,
Samantha bransgrove,</i>

08:43.087 --> 08:44.188
<i>is on-site, live.</i>

08:44.222 --> 08:46.491
<i>Samantha, what can you tell us
about this explosion?</i>

08:48.058 --> 08:50.996
<i>Marcus, the entire town
has just dropped dead.</i>

08:51.029 --> 08:53.298
<i>I repeat, nothing and no one</i>

08:53.331 --> 08:56.168
<i>has survived
this mysterious explosion.</i>

08:56.201 --> 08:57.536
<i>The town is currently sealed off</i>

08:57.568 --> 09:01.005
<i>and we're at least 50 miles
from ground zero.</i>

09:01.039 --> 09:01.907
<i>The air around the town</i>

09:01.939 --> 09:04.075
<i>is considered to be
highly toxic.</i>

09:04.108 --> 09:05.409
<i>Now, as you can see behind me,</i>

09:05.443 --> 09:07.511
<i>the entrance to the town
is heavily guarded</i>

09:07.544 --> 09:10.214
<i>and no one is allowed in
without a Hazmat suit.</i>

09:10.247 --> 09:12.150
<i>Do we have any leads
at this stage</i>

09:12.183 --> 09:15.220
<i>as to who or what could have
caused this explosion?</i>

09:15.252 --> 09:17.455
<i>Marcus, unfortunately
at this point,</i>

09:17.489 --> 09:19.191
<i>we have no solid leads.</i>

09:19.223 --> 09:21.425
<i>There is, however,
a lot of speculation.</i>

09:21.458 --> 09:23.561
<i>Some say that
it was a deadly explosion</i>

09:23.595 --> 09:24.529
<i>from a chemical plant</i>

09:24.563 --> 09:27.265
<i>that has contaminated
the entire town.</i>

09:27.298 --> 09:29.500
<i>Others say
it was a chemical bomb.</i>

09:29.534 --> 09:33.404
<i>The question is, Marcus,
if this was a chemical bomb,</i>

09:33.438 --> 09:36.107
<i>why a small farming community?</i>

09:36.140 --> 09:38.075
<i>If this really
was a terrorist attack,</i>

09:38.108 --> 09:39.577
<i>why not a major city?</i>

09:39.611 --> 09:42.146
<i>L.A., New York, Chicago.</i>

09:42.179 --> 09:44.782
<i>We have no more information
at this stage, Marcus,</i>

09:44.816 --> 09:47.353
<i>however, clearly,
something very devastating.</i>

10:43.174 --> 10:44.510
Dr. Lauren stone?

10:47.745 --> 10:49.214
Yeah?

10:49.246 --> 10:50.281
I'm sergeant Clayton.

10:50.314 --> 10:52.616
This is sergeant Jones,
u s. Army.

10:52.650 --> 10:53.660
You're coming with us, ma'am.

10:53.684 --> 10:55.654
You've heard about
the explosion in badger?

10:56.520 --> 10:57.354
Yeah.

10:57.389 --> 10:59.491
It's a matter
of national security.

10:59.524 --> 11:00.592
You are urgently needed.

11:01.125 --> 11:01.893
You must be mistaken.

11:01.925 --> 11:03.060
It's not a mistake, ma'am.

11:03.093 --> 11:07.332
We're also authorized to use
excessive force if needed.

11:47.672 --> 11:49.174
Colonel Roger emmerich.

11:49.207 --> 11:50.241
Lauren stone.

11:50.275 --> 11:52.144
I know who you are.

11:52.177 --> 11:53.577
I've heard a lot about you.

11:53.611 --> 11:54.678
Why am I here?

11:54.712 --> 11:55.713
Follow me.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.761
This is
professor David Santiago,

12:09.794 --> 12:11.395
astrobiologist.

12:11.428 --> 12:13.597
Exobiologist Dr. Lauren stone.

12:13.630 --> 12:15.467
She works for NASA.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.501
Geologists have confirmed
it's a meteorite,

12:17.534 --> 12:20.438
estimated to be the size
of a basketball when it hit.

12:20.871 --> 12:22.473
No one saw it coming.

12:22.506 --> 12:23.574
A meteorite?

12:23.607 --> 12:24.909
I know what you're thinking.

12:24.943 --> 12:27.913
Meteorites don't release
toxic gas and kill people.

12:27.946 --> 12:29.380
Well, this one did.

12:29.414 --> 12:32.217
And it unleashed hell
within a 20-mile radius.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.083
We managed to gather up

12:33.117 --> 12:34.685
a few little pieces
here and there.

12:34.718 --> 12:36.954
But it appears to have just hit

12:36.987 --> 12:38.856
and dissolved into the soil.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.391
No leads?

12:40.424 --> 12:41.193
No.

12:41.226 --> 12:43.227
No, all we know
is a space object

12:43.260 --> 12:46.798
is responsible
for 373 innocent lives,

12:46.831 --> 12:48.433
and no one can figure it out.

12:48.466 --> 12:51.669
But whatever it is,
it's highly toxic,

12:51.702 --> 12:52.871
it's airborne,

12:52.904 --> 12:54.673
and you just
don't want to breathe it.

12:55.673 --> 12:58.277
So, uh, why are we here?

12:59.443 --> 13:01.279
We're dealing with something

13:01.312 --> 13:03.281
we haven't dealt with before.

13:03.313 --> 13:05.717
I just need you to get in,
do your thing,

13:05.750 --> 13:07.219
and get out. And remember,

13:07.251 --> 13:09.353
any information will be vital.

13:10.922 --> 13:12.290
No more questions?

13:12.323 --> 13:13.223
- Yeah...
- Good.

13:13.257 --> 13:16.460
I need you to suit up.
Bus leaves in ten.

13:20.631 --> 13:21.732
Lauren.

13:27.704 --> 13:29.407
Do you know why I chose you?

13:30.475 --> 13:32.444
Because I needed a believer.

13:33.611 --> 13:35.313
I read your file.

13:35.346 --> 13:37.549
They say
if it's out of this world,

13:37.582 --> 13:38.917
you will find it.

13:38.949 --> 13:41.520
Now something is buried
in there somewhere.

13:42.786 --> 13:44.222
Oh, and...

13:45.057 --> 13:48.226
A sobriety test
will be conducted on you.

13:49.961 --> 13:52.496
It's mandatory,
nothing personal.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.299
I did read your book.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.270
Found it pretty insightful,
actually.

14:32.403 --> 14:34.573
I know you caught
some flak for it, but...

14:36.341 --> 14:39.510
"Microbial ecosystems
of the antarctic."

14:41.978 --> 14:44.715
Yeah, that bit about
morphological signatures

14:44.749 --> 14:46.351
of extraterrestrial life...

14:50.420 --> 14:52.523
It's kind of like
when you read something

14:53.191 --> 14:55.327
and it makes you
want to keep going.

14:58.763 --> 15:00.299
Anyways...

15:03.134 --> 15:04.702
These are my boys.

15:05.870 --> 15:07.339
Sam and Michael.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.845
Sam says to me, he says, uh...

15:14.879 --> 15:16.648
He says, "dad, when I grow up",

15:16.680 --> 15:18.549
"I wanna follow
in your footsteps."

15:20.851 --> 15:22.321
I say, "no."

15:23.188 --> 15:25.524
You have to follow your own
passions, you know?

15:26.757 --> 15:29.693
I say, "you're not gonna
follow my footsteps",

15:29.726 --> 15:31.329
"you're gonna play ball."

15:32.496 --> 15:33.865
Pretty good at baseball.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.603
Then Michael...

15:39.636 --> 15:43.342
Michael says to me, says, "dad,
why do you do what you do?"

15:45.576 --> 15:46.945
I say, "don't you wanna find out"

15:46.977 --> 15:48.746
"if there's life
outside this planet?"

15:49.746 --> 15:50.915
"Aliens?"

15:51.783 --> 15:53.351
"Other species?"

15:56.453 --> 15:59.524
He's like,
"no, I can live with that."

16:03.593 --> 16:07.866
He pauses for a moment... get this.
He pauses for a moment,

16:07.899 --> 16:11.736
and I can see he's thinking something.
He looks at me,

16:11.769 --> 16:13.538
right in my eyes,

16:14.105 --> 16:17.142
deep into my soul,

16:17.174 --> 16:22.947
and he says... he says, "dad, why don't
you get a real job like Jason's dad?"

16:22.980 --> 16:26.885
"He's a plumber."

16:30.822 --> 16:32.924
Anyways,

16:34.525 --> 16:36.895
makes you wanna find
something even more, you know?

16:41.698 --> 16:43.868
Just don't want to feel like
you're wasting your life.

17:24.508 --> 17:26.577
What do you think?

17:26.611 --> 17:29.448
What do I think?

17:30.614 --> 17:32.450
I think Michael was right.

17:34.752 --> 17:36.988
Plumbing job doesn't sound
so bad right about now.

17:40.157 --> 17:41.893
What the hell are we looking at?

17:44.061 --> 17:45.697
There's nothing here.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.036
Think I wish I had
a more form-fitting suit.

17:53.271 --> 17:55.707
Really bunching up
in the nether bits, you know?

17:57.007 --> 17:58.843
Think I just stepped in shit.

19:09.846 --> 19:11.549
Hey, there.

21:43.367 --> 21:48.339
<i>Could you ask her,
"one side of the town is barricaded.</i>"

21:48.371 --> 21:50.240
<i>"What are they trying to hide?"</i>

22:11.262 --> 22:14.065
<i>Um, after that explosion,</i>

22:14.098 --> 22:17.534
<i>some kind of chemical was spread</i>

22:17.567 --> 22:19.236
<i>and a lot of people died.</i>

22:19.269 --> 22:23.874
<i>Chemicals? Ask her where
is she getting her information from.</i>

22:37.554 --> 22:39.489
<i>Kohler, the neighbor's son,</i>

22:39.523 --> 22:43.895
<i>he's in army, so that's where
they get this information from.</i>

22:44.594 --> 22:46.963
<i>The neighbor's son? I see.</i>

22:46.996 --> 22:49.499
<i>So why are they hiding it
from the rest of the world?</i>

22:49.533 --> 22:53.471
<i>Can you ask her, most
importantly, what are they hiding?</i>

23:05.114 --> 23:09.019
<i>Something else happen
after that explosion.</i>

23:26.469 --> 23:28.139
<i>It was some kind of seed,</i>

23:28.171 --> 23:33.177
<i>and something else grew out of
it, something big,</i>

23:33.209 --> 23:37.582
<i>and after that, everything died,</i>

23:37.614 --> 23:41.451
<i>birds, animals, everything.</i>

23:47.091 --> 23:49.293
<i>And some kind of tree
grew out of it</i>

23:49.325 --> 23:52.329
<i>but it doesn't exist anymore.
They destroyed it.</i>

23:54.564 --> 23:57.334
<i>And some kind of tree
grew out of it</i>

23:57.368 --> 24:00.571
<i>but it doesn't exist anymore.
They destroyed it.</i>

24:00.603 --> 24:02.372
<i>Okay. I need more.</i>

24:02.406 --> 24:04.207
<i>A tree? What kind of tree?</i>

24:04.240 --> 24:06.443
<i>You mentioned a seed.
Tell me more about this seed.</i>

24:06.476 --> 24:08.612
<i>Sir, she said enough</i>

24:08.646 --> 24:11.148
<i>and she just doesn't know...
She doesn't have more information.</i>

24:11.180 --> 24:13.884
<i>And she asked you to leave.</i>

25:22.085 --> 25:25.555
<i>- I'm Dr. Maria paselo.
- And I'm Dr. Keith herd.</i>

25:25.589 --> 25:30.328
<i>Today's Monday, the fourth of
march and the time now is 8:45 A.M.</i>

25:30.361 --> 25:34.130
<i>And I'm here to perform
an autopsy on Robert windsor.</i>

25:34.163 --> 25:37.000
<i>I will be assisted
by my colleague, Dr. Herd,</i>

25:37.034 --> 25:39.637
and this autopsy will be
carried out in four stages...

25:39.669 --> 25:44.175
An external evaluation followed by an
internal evaluation with the heart,

25:44.207 --> 25:47.344
<i>lungs, digestive organs
and finally, the brain.</i>

26:21.812 --> 26:23.246
Skin seems normal.

26:24.214 --> 26:26.150
Far too normal if you ask me.

26:39.595 --> 26:41.031
No rigor mortis.

26:46.003 --> 26:48.406
Attempting primary incision now.

26:58.649 --> 27:00.418
What the hell is that?

27:53.769 --> 27:55.505
What's happening?

27:57.541 --> 27:59.210
He's healing.

28:10.153 --> 28:11.354
He's moving.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.457
What?

28:19.396 --> 28:21.632
Sweet Mary, mother of Jesus...

28:47.357 --> 28:49.127
I'd like to leave the room.

29:11.614 --> 29:14.284
This is Karen mcknight.

29:14.317 --> 29:17.387
I'm the acting director for
the center of disease control.

29:18.088 --> 29:20.391
You're in a quarantine facility.

29:21.624 --> 29:23.294
Can you hear me?

29:24.727 --> 29:28.932
I need you to raise your hand
if you can understand me.

29:28.966 --> 29:32.570
Or... even a blink will do,
anything.

29:39.543 --> 29:41.212
I'm staying.

29:46.283 --> 29:48.186
What would you like me to do?

29:49.953 --> 29:51.489
Check his pulse.

30:40.871 --> 30:42.273
There's no pulse.

30:45.976 --> 30:47.678
The body is cold.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.249
No blood pressure.

30:54.551 --> 30:56.320
No, um...

30:58.455 --> 31:00.424
How is this possible?

31:28.784 --> 31:30.487
You, um...

31:32.421 --> 31:34.824
You've been a victim
of a biological attack.

31:49.038 --> 31:51.741
There was an explosion.

33:13.623 --> 33:15.801
<i>These people were examined
and pronounced dead two nights ago,</i>

33:15.825 --> 33:18.594
- following a massive chemical explosion...
- Back off now!

33:18.628 --> 33:21.031
However at 9:00 am
eastern standard time today,

33:21.063 --> 33:22.532
these people Rose from the dead

33:22.565 --> 33:27.904
and are now once again alive. They came...
They came back to life, Tom.

33:37.281 --> 33:40.082
<i>Scientists and religious groups are
absolutely baffled by this event.</i>

33:40.115 --> 33:41.784
<i>I heard various
commentary suggesting</i>

33:41.817 --> 33:45.688
<i>that this could be an act
of evil or perhaps a miracle,</i>

33:45.721 --> 33:48.157
<i>while some are trying to find
a scientific explanation</i>

33:48.190 --> 33:50.059
<i>behind this unprecedented event.</i>

33:50.092 --> 33:53.764
<i>And this is unprecedented, Tom,
nobody knows why this happened</i>

33:53.796 --> 33:55.075
<i>or why these people
have returned.</i>

33:55.099 --> 33:58.968
<i>But the feeling is that they
must be here for a reason.</i>

34:11.981 --> 34:12.983
Rough day, huh?

34:21.724 --> 34:23.660
Look, can I get you something?

34:35.604 --> 34:37.874
Look, I don't know what
happened out there today, but...

34:42.111 --> 34:43.613
I'm on your side.

34:47.684 --> 34:51.555
Just... let me know how I could help
you, all right?

34:51.887 --> 34:52.889
I...

34:56.593 --> 34:57.962
I just need a minute.

35:09.673 --> 35:12.843
Yeah. We're partners, right?

35:24.787 --> 35:26.923
Look, you sure you don't
need something to drink?

36:18.340 --> 36:19.709
Home.

36:28.218 --> 36:29.820
An entire town

36:29.852 --> 36:32.856
of 1,300 people drops dead.

36:35.124 --> 36:39.162
49 of those victims
rise up from the dead.

36:43.365 --> 36:45.034
Can someone explain to me...

36:46.802 --> 36:47.904
Why them?

36:50.240 --> 36:52.876
What happened to
the rest of the town?

36:56.111 --> 36:57.113
We, uh...

36:58.113 --> 36:59.650
We do have a theory, ma'am.

37:05.021 --> 37:06.156
Enlighten me.

37:10.392 --> 37:13.796
The 49 badger victims
who were resurrected

37:13.829 --> 37:16.967
resided in close proximity
of the initial explosion.

37:16.999 --> 37:19.969
Now these victims didn't
just inhale the toxic air,

37:20.003 --> 37:24.775
but they also swallowed a substance
which was spread from the explosion.

37:27.876 --> 37:29.712
What kind of substance?

37:31.014 --> 37:34.284
It's the...
The fragments of the meteorite

37:34.316 --> 37:37.220
which resulted in transforming
their internal organs.

37:39.088 --> 37:42.825
I guess you can say it's a
formation of a new life form

37:42.858 --> 37:46.162
within the human body, governor.

37:47.430 --> 37:50.868
The rest of the town died just
by breathing the toxic air.

37:53.001 --> 37:54.270
In other words,

37:55.805 --> 37:57.941
anyone who's exposed to the air

37:57.974 --> 38:01.245
in badger today... will die.

38:02.912 --> 38:05.115
And nothing can bring 'em back.

38:16.559 --> 38:20.362
By the way,
they seem to be doing that a lot.

38:20.396 --> 38:24.068
Facing one particular direction.

38:37.079 --> 38:38.881
How you doing, kid?

38:41.084 --> 38:42.119
You okay?

38:46.856 --> 38:48.758
This is a repeated event.

38:50.425 --> 38:52.027
Pardon me?

38:52.061 --> 38:55.198
The meteorite or whatever
they're calling it.

38:56.365 --> 38:57.867
How so?

38:58.434 --> 39:02.205
February 15th, 2013.

39:02.238 --> 39:04.975
There was a similar
explosion in Russia.

39:05.008 --> 39:08.278
Chelyabinsk.
Yeah, chelyabinsk, Russia.

39:08.311 --> 39:09.678
I'm aware of it.

39:09.713 --> 39:15.017
People died from similar symptoms,
but it didn't just end there.

39:17.287 --> 39:19.256
- Colonel...
- I'm listening.

39:22.157 --> 39:25.895
- The Russians are hiding something.
- You think it's the Russians?

39:25.928 --> 39:26.930
No...

39:27.597 --> 39:29.767
The Russians were the victims.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.334
Hm.

39:31.367 --> 39:33.303
This wasn't an accident.

39:34.204 --> 39:35.205
We were targeted.

39:38.941 --> 39:42.012
That's a very
interesting theory.

39:42.044 --> 39:44.814
Tell me, how did you
come up with this?

39:46.316 --> 39:48.985
- I found a report online.
- Online?

39:49.017 --> 39:50.387
- The dark web.
- Dark web?

39:50.419 --> 39:51.454
Okay.

39:51.486 --> 39:55.191
Colonel, I know how it sounds.

39:56.325 --> 39:57.894
Good.

40:08.303 --> 40:10.573
They have no heartbeat,
no respiration,

40:10.606 --> 40:13.043
no detectable signs
of any brain functionality.

40:13.075 --> 40:14.043
They don't eat,
they don't sleep.

40:14.077 --> 40:17.147
In other words,
they're as dead as Elvis.

40:17.180 --> 40:21.451
No respiration,
no brain functionality, um...

40:21.483 --> 40:24.019
Excuse me, miss mcknight, um...

40:24.052 --> 40:26.088
What exactly is moving them?

40:26.122 --> 40:29.193
Well, Mr. President,
they most certainly appear to be dead.

40:29.959 --> 40:31.895
I... I'm listening.

40:31.927 --> 40:33.171
Blood and tissue
analysis have revealed

40:33.195 --> 40:36.232
a number of compounds we're
still struggling to identify.

40:36.265 --> 40:38.468
At a deeper level,
we've seen a wholesale breakdown

40:38.501 --> 40:42.171
and a resequencing of DNA in
what used to be red blood cells.

40:42.204 --> 40:43.038
Resequencing?

40:43.072 --> 40:45.574
Yes, sir. A purposeful
resequencing.

40:45.608 --> 40:47.244
This isn't some random change.

40:47.276 --> 40:49.947
The same new sequence is
repeated in each victim.

40:50.445 --> 40:52.214
They're changing.

40:52.247 --> 40:55.150
What the hell
does that actually mean?

40:55.184 --> 40:58.889
We believe the DNA is being
deliberately modified

40:58.921 --> 41:02.425
into an unknown DNA sequence.

41:02.457 --> 41:05.162
An extraterrestrial sequence.

41:05.494 --> 41:07.496
Aliens, general.

41:07.530 --> 41:09.432
I say we put them down.

41:09.465 --> 41:10.566
Problem solved.

41:10.599 --> 41:11.934
Incinerate them.

41:11.968 --> 41:13.337
I'm with the general.

41:13.602 --> 41:15.005
I see.

41:15.470 --> 41:17.006
Ms. Stone.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.108
You clearly have
an opinion on all this.

41:19.142 --> 41:21.945
Would you mind sharing
that with everyone?

41:23.345 --> 41:28.418
Chelyabinsk, by a small village in the
ural mountains near the Kazakhstan border,

41:28.450 --> 41:33.689
an almost identical meteorite strike
and reports of almost identical deaths

41:33.722 --> 41:37.026
in a large area
surrounding the impact zone.

41:37.059 --> 41:39.128
The world is aware
of the meteorite strike,

41:39.162 --> 41:42.966
but the Russians kept
the remaining a secret.

41:44.166 --> 41:46.302
They incinerated
an entire village.

41:47.202 --> 41:49.005
My point exactly.

41:49.037 --> 41:50.340
The Russians made a smart move.

41:50.372 --> 41:54.343
All I'm saying is this has happened
before, it may happen again.

41:55.544 --> 41:56.689
We need to be able to stop it.

41:56.713 --> 41:58.581
We need answers.

41:58.613 --> 42:01.450
First chelyabinsk, then badger.

42:01.483 --> 42:03.018
What's next?

42:03.052 --> 42:07.724
Manhattan?
Population 1.6 million.

42:07.756 --> 42:11.327
Do you have any other
evidence to support this?

42:11.360 --> 42:13.162
Other than some video

42:13.195 --> 42:17.233
on YouTube or a few images could
easily have been photoshopped?

42:19.369 --> 42:21.037
No, Mr. President.

42:23.405 --> 42:24.474
Oh, boy.

42:26.843 --> 42:29.980
<i>Is there even a point
in keeping these resurrected?</i>

42:30.012 --> 42:32.181
- <i>Any sign of any life or communication?</i>
- Hey.

42:37.419 --> 42:39.421
Do you mind?

42:39.454 --> 42:43.360
<i>As to whether they should be
incinerated and put to rest or not.</i>

42:43.392 --> 42:46.628
<i>The president has made an executive
decision to keep them a little longer,</i>

42:46.662 --> 42:49.064
- <i>and I believe that decision was made...</i>
- Keep the change.

42:49.097 --> 42:50.465
<i>Based on theory by my colleague</i>

42:50.499 --> 42:53.570
<i>and one of the lead scientists
on this case, Ms. Lauren stone.</i>

43:04.780 --> 43:07.217
<i>We're going some place secret.</i>

43:07.883 --> 43:10.019
<i>Now I need you to be a good girl</i>

43:10.052 --> 43:11.621
<i>and don't tell anyone.</i>

43:11.653 --> 43:14.390
<i>I mean nobody
about our secret place.</i>

43:14.923 --> 43:16.726
<i>Not even mommy, okay?</i>

43:16.758 --> 43:18.527
You okay in there?

43:19.829 --> 43:22.032
Yeah, yeah, i'm... I'm fine.

43:22.064 --> 43:24.700
I... I was just
looking for my ID.

43:24.733 --> 43:26.035
I...

43:26.068 --> 43:27.102
I found it.

43:27.135 --> 43:28.637
- Okay.
- All good.

43:28.671 --> 43:30.040
Just checking.

44:17.186 --> 44:18.321
<i>We miss you.</i>

44:26.461 --> 44:27.463
<i>I miss you.</i>

44:32.200 --> 44:34.503
<i>The baby's been
kicking like crazy.</i>

44:36.572 --> 44:38.474
<i>Say something.</i>

44:38.508 --> 44:40.276
<i>Please.</i>

44:40.309 --> 44:41.211
Anything?

44:41.244 --> 44:43.446
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

44:43.479 --> 44:44.548
Not even a blink.

44:49.885 --> 44:52.588
Look at your daughter.
Look at her.

44:54.523 --> 44:56.191
By the way...

44:56.224 --> 44:57.493
You're wasting your time.

44:58.628 --> 45:00.197
Nothing's going to happen.

45:07.302 --> 45:09.438
Something's got to happen.

45:55.818 --> 45:57.486
Hey.

46:01.557 --> 46:03.226
I brought you something.

46:09.264 --> 46:10.699
<i>A galaxy far beyond.</i>

46:14.302 --> 46:16.305
It was my favorite book
when I was a kid.

46:19.575 --> 46:20.710
It still is.

46:24.713 --> 46:26.482
My mom used to read it to me.

46:32.921 --> 46:34.590
She died when I was 10.

46:41.997 --> 46:43.633
I was 10 years old. I...

46:49.704 --> 46:51.340
I didn't even cry.

46:55.945 --> 46:57.380
<i>That's not normal.</i>

47:16.999 --> 47:18.668
You're a good listener.

47:32.381 --> 47:35.252
You have to give me something.

47:40.523 --> 47:41.524
Anything.

48:49.992 --> 48:52.128
Could just be the color red.

48:52.160 --> 48:55.430
It's often used as
an expression of love,

48:55.463 --> 48:59.436
or the opposite to symbolize
war, destruction.

49:03.005 --> 49:05.575
It's the plant.

49:05.608 --> 49:08.378
Someone in there needs
to be taken to this plant.

49:13.916 --> 49:16.084
Why wasn't this plant reported?

49:16.117 --> 49:18.554
It was just a two-inch seedling.

49:20.622 --> 49:21.624
Yeah.

49:22.925 --> 49:24.961
Two-inch seedling.

49:24.994 --> 49:28.430
Happens to grow in the middle
of a toxic impact crater

49:28.463 --> 49:30.366
and wiped out an entire town.

49:32.767 --> 49:35.637
Listen, this is a matter
of national security.

49:35.671 --> 49:37.439
We're not sure what
we're dealing with here.

49:37.472 --> 49:39.708
Call them zombies, aliens.

49:41.209 --> 49:43.380
We don't know what
they're capable of.

49:44.512 --> 49:46.382
We can't just take them there.

49:52.053 --> 49:54.724
You know, muslims,
when they pray,

49:54.756 --> 49:57.526
they're commanded to face
a specific direction.

49:58.628 --> 50:02.097
No matter where they are in the
world, they always face mecca.

50:02.131 --> 50:03.700
The holiest city to them.

50:08.236 --> 50:09.872
They're all facing north.

50:11.072 --> 50:12.574
So, what are you saying?

50:13.476 --> 50:14.744
They're all muslims?

50:16.177 --> 50:17.679
I'm saying...

50:19.481 --> 50:20.816
That we're here.

50:21.983 --> 50:23.419
Now go north.

50:32.961 --> 50:33.963
Badger.

50:36.164 --> 50:37.599
There's something there.

50:45.139 --> 50:46.508
What?

50:48.110 --> 50:49.579
What is it?

50:55.217 --> 50:56.919
We found your seedling.

51:02.724 --> 51:03.992
Colonel!

51:04.026 --> 51:05.028
It's breaking news.

51:06.262 --> 51:07.630
It's gone viral.

51:13.135 --> 51:14.504
Follow me.

51:21.744 --> 51:24.579
<i>Now, Tom, we're not sure
exactly what it is.</i>

51:24.613 --> 51:27.082
<i>Whatever it is,
it's an unearthly beast</i>

51:27.115 --> 51:30.952
<i>a mysterious giant
extraterrestrial phenomenon.</i>

51:30.985 --> 51:33.622
<i>And it's still growing.</i>

51:33.655 --> 51:36.592
<i>Susan, I'm just
a bit baffled in here.</i>

51:36.624 --> 51:40.161
<i>I mean, how did a monstrous
object that size go unnoticed?</i>

51:40.195 --> 51:41.697
<i>Were they trying to hide it?</i>

51:41.729 --> 51:43.832
<i>Surely someone would
have noticed it at some point.</i>

51:43.865 --> 51:47.302
<i>Now, Tom, as you're aware,
the town has been highly guarded.</i>

51:47.336 --> 51:48.337
<i>It's been a no-go zone.</i>

51:48.371 --> 51:51.206
<i>No one's been in or out
since the incident.</i>

51:51.240 --> 51:52.808
<i>The scientists got what
they needed.</i>

51:52.840 --> 51:54.476
<i>I believe the last two
who were on site</i>

51:54.510 --> 51:59.782
<i>were astrobiologist Dr. David Santiago
and exobiologist Dr. Lauren stone.</i>

51:59.814 --> 52:01.751
<i>Nothing was seen or
reported by them.</i>

52:01.784 --> 52:04.921
<i>So clearly, this thing did not
exist two days ago.</i>

52:04.954 --> 52:08.189
<i>It's grown to this enormous
size in a short period of time,</i>

52:08.222 --> 52:10.625
<i>and it's highly toxic.</i>

52:10.659 --> 52:12.836
<i>You wouldn't be able to go
near it without a Hazmat suit,</i>

52:12.860 --> 52:15.564
<i>and it's creating
its own atmosphere.</i>

52:15.597 --> 52:17.766
<i>What was once speculated
to be a meteorite</i>

52:17.800 --> 52:20.602
<i>is now confirmed to be a seed</i>

52:20.635 --> 52:23.872
<i>that's resulted in
growing this phenomenon.</i>

52:23.905 --> 52:26.775
<i>Now we're not sure
its purpose just yet.</i>

52:26.809 --> 52:28.111
<i>But it's here for a reason.</i>

54:52.253 --> 54:53.989
So that's your seedling, huh?

55:53.014 --> 55:54.750
Don't get too attached to it.

55:55.883 --> 55:57.954
Be shut down before you know it.

55:58.486 --> 56:00.356
As toxic as hell.

56:32.486 --> 56:33.856
You know...

56:38.459 --> 56:40.329
Part of me wants him to move.

56:43.465 --> 56:44.800
Part of me doesn't.

56:46.034 --> 56:47.936
Bet you 20 bucks
he ain't moving.

56:51.106 --> 56:52.275
Make that 40.

56:54.008 --> 56:55.343
- You're on.
- Count me in.

56:56.445 --> 56:57.814
He ain't moving.

56:59.881 --> 57:02.318
Shouldn't we be getting him
a blanket or something?

57:04.019 --> 57:07.089
How about you get me a blanket?
Can't feel my goddamn toes.

57:08.189 --> 57:09.258
What toes?

57:10.092 --> 57:11.093
Exactly.

57:19.133 --> 57:20.336
Come on.

57:30.244 --> 57:31.447
Come on.

57:36.151 --> 57:37.887
Come on. Damn it.

57:45.961 --> 57:47.263
He's moving.

59:40.809 --> 59:42.244
Welcome to earth.

59:51.485 --> 59:53.221
I cannot go back with you.

59:58.059 --> 1:00:00.262
I will not
survive your environment.

1:00:08.570 --> 1:00:10.372
It has a reverse effect.

1:00:10.405 --> 1:00:12.740
We cannot survive
the environment around it.

1:00:12.773 --> 1:00:15.476
But just as our plants
here on earth

1:00:15.510 --> 1:00:17.146
provide oxygen for us,

1:00:17.178 --> 1:00:18.780
it's life-giving for them.

1:00:18.814 --> 1:00:22.117
Our closest neighboring star
is 4.2 light years away.

1:00:22.150 --> 1:00:23.718
<i>How did they reach us out here?</i>

1:00:23.751 --> 1:00:28.256
<i>There are reports of portals a few
tens of thousands of miles from earth.</i>

1:00:28.289 --> 1:00:30.224
<i>They're also known as wormholes.</i>

1:00:30.258 --> 1:00:33.262
<i>A wormhole is a tunnel
that creates a shortcut</i>

1:00:33.294 --> 1:00:35.130
<i>for long journeys
across the universe.</i>

1:00:35.162 --> 1:00:37.398
<i>Are you saying
that if these victims,</i>

1:00:37.432 --> 1:00:40.369
<i>the resurrected, were taken
to this tree object,</i>

1:00:40.401 --> 1:00:43.104
<i>they'd also communicate
or show signs of life?</i>

1:00:43.137 --> 1:00:45.549
<i>Miss stone, is it true that
you're on probation for dui charges?</i>

1:00:45.573 --> 1:00:48.309
<i>Did NASA know or
predict anything about this?</i>

1:00:48.343 --> 1:00:50.479
<i>Surely someone would
have known something.</i>

1:01:07.028 --> 1:01:09.630
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

1:01:10.831 --> 1:01:13.835
<i>Lauren, hi.
It's Dr. Mason calling.</i>

1:01:13.869 --> 1:01:18.173
<i>Look, I'm just a little concerned,
you missed a couple of sessions.</i>

1:01:18.206 --> 1:01:19.842
<i>I mean, it's good to see
you on TV.</i>

1:01:19.874 --> 1:01:21.610
<i>You're back on the field.</i>

1:01:21.642 --> 1:01:23.144
<i>You're doing great things.</i>

1:01:24.111 --> 1:01:26.615
<i>But, Lauren, the sessions
are mandatory.</i>

1:01:26.648 --> 1:01:28.816
<i>It's part of your dui arrest.</i>

1:01:28.849 --> 1:01:31.452
<i>It's by court order.
As your counselor,</i>

1:01:31.485 --> 1:01:35.156
<i>I have an obligation to report
it to your parole officer.</i>

1:01:37.159 --> 1:01:38.626
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

1:01:40.394 --> 1:01:41.829
<i>And we ran out
of time last session.</i>

1:01:41.863 --> 1:01:45.601
<i>But I also want to talk to you
more about the ongoing flashbacks,</i>

1:01:45.633 --> 1:01:47.602
<i>dreams you're having.</i>

1:01:47.635 --> 1:01:49.871
<i>You also mentioned flying.</i>

1:01:49.905 --> 1:01:52.408
<i>Flying normally
represents a sense of freedom</i>

1:01:52.941 --> 1:01:54.310
<i>or an escape.</i>

1:01:55.876 --> 1:01:57.412
<i>Maybe related...</i>

1:01:58.313 --> 1:01:59.448
<i>Look...</i>

1:01:59.481 --> 1:02:01.783
<i>Why don't you just
call me, okay?</i>

1:02:01.816 --> 1:02:03.452
<i>Call me directly.</i>

1:02:03.485 --> 1:02:06.521
<i>555-212-4545.</i>

1:02:23.704 --> 1:02:24.706
Hey.

1:02:33.381 --> 1:02:36.719
I was in town, thought I'd come
by and say hello.

1:02:47.329 --> 1:02:49.365
That smells terrible.

1:03:05.814 --> 1:03:07.183
May I?

1:03:39.347 --> 1:03:40.349
I...

1:03:41.383 --> 1:03:43.485
Haven't had a chance
to clean up.

1:03:44.952 --> 1:03:46.354
I don't mind.

1:04:09.043 --> 1:04:10.411
The cap's on.

1:04:21.356 --> 1:04:23.825
You were turning eight and...

1:04:25.492 --> 1:04:27.729
And I asked you what you wanted
for your birthday.

1:04:29.396 --> 1:04:31.532
You asked for a science lab.

1:04:40.041 --> 1:04:42.443
Not a pony.

1:04:43.945 --> 1:04:46.414
Not a bike or a Barbie doll.

1:04:47.948 --> 1:04:49.284
But a lab.

1:04:52.553 --> 1:04:54.423
We let you use the old shed.

1:04:59.693 --> 1:05:03.465
Your passion,
your, your obsession

1:05:03.497 --> 1:05:06.534
with science and space,

1:05:08.436 --> 1:05:09.805
building projects...

1:05:12.807 --> 1:05:14.510
Things got out of hand.

1:05:18.813 --> 1:05:19.814
I...

1:05:20.981 --> 1:05:22.750
Guess your mom
got a bit worried.

1:05:36.131 --> 1:05:37.566
How's things back home?

1:05:40.968 --> 1:05:42.338
Things.

1:05:46.106 --> 1:05:49.711
I guess lonely would be
about the right word.

1:05:55.048 --> 1:05:56.485
I lost your mother.

1:05:58.552 --> 1:06:03.491
And then I... lost you.

1:06:05.492 --> 1:06:07.496
It's been hard, you know?

1:06:13.767 --> 1:06:14.970
I've missed you.

1:06:48.035 --> 1:06:49.405
Well...

1:06:54.242 --> 1:06:55.811
It was good to see you.

1:07:35.582 --> 1:07:37.852
It's refusing to talk to anyone
but you.

1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:41.989
Uh, just give us a second.
Thank you.

1:07:43.157 --> 1:07:45.193
It wants to talk to Lauren.

1:07:45.226 --> 1:07:48.662
Homeland security,
all its bag of tricks,

1:07:48.695 --> 1:07:50.832
all their techniques
couldn't make it budge.

1:07:51.999 --> 1:07:53.768
It just wants to talk to you.

1:07:55.602 --> 1:07:57.505
Seems it's found a friend
in you.

1:08:00.742 --> 1:08:02.845
I see the feeling is mutual.

1:08:04.678 --> 1:08:05.981
It won't be needing these.

1:08:09.117 --> 1:08:10.486
This thing...

1:08:11.119 --> 1:08:12.653
It's not like us.

1:08:13.287 --> 1:08:14.889
It is not human.

1:08:17.125 --> 1:08:18.560
You remember that.

1:08:22.796 --> 1:08:24.832
I've prepared a list
of questions.

1:08:26.567 --> 1:08:27.969
It's important you look at them.

1:08:32.173 --> 1:08:34.041
I need you to find out
what it is,

1:08:34.976 --> 1:08:36.077
where did it come from,

1:08:37.144 --> 1:08:38.780
and most importantly,

1:08:40.113 --> 1:08:41.517
<i>what does it want?</i>

1:08:42.884 --> 1:08:45.954
Our home was no longer habitable
for our species.

1:08:49.357 --> 1:08:51.059
We searched for a new home.

1:08:54.262 --> 1:08:55.697
We found one.

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.135
Why earth?

1:09:04.304 --> 1:09:06.807
It doesn't grow anywhere else.

1:09:08.175 --> 1:09:13.048
We were given the coordinates
to find this planet.

1:09:14.247 --> 1:09:15.750
Coordinates?

1:09:20.888 --> 1:09:21.957
By who?

1:09:23.124 --> 1:09:24.893
One of your kind.

1:09:26.094 --> 1:09:27.996
He calls himself

1:09:30.031 --> 1:09:32.568
supernova 94.

1:09:35.068 --> 1:09:36.905
Supernova 94.

1:09:37.371 --> 1:09:38.906
He searched for us.

1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:42.009
He made contact with us.

1:09:45.112 --> 1:09:46.781
We know your strengths.

1:09:47.982 --> 1:09:49.751
We know your weaknesses.

1:10:04.665 --> 1:10:07.068
Ask them to leave.

1:10:13.875 --> 1:10:15.010
I can't do that.

1:10:18.312 --> 1:10:20.749
They won't let it go on
much longer.

1:10:22.916 --> 1:10:24.885
It's harming our environment.

1:10:29.156 --> 1:10:30.191
Our home.

1:10:31.858 --> 1:10:33.995
We will change your environment.

1:10:36.030 --> 1:10:37.733
You cannot stop us.

1:10:40.802 --> 1:10:43.005
We come from a hostile world.

1:10:49.343 --> 1:10:53.648
We will not descend in peace.

1:11:17.738 --> 1:11:22.076
We have abilities.

1:11:41.228 --> 1:11:42.229
George?

1:11:53.441 --> 1:11:54.809
George?

1:12:00.848 --> 1:12:02.184
Do you hear me?

1:12:08.089 --> 1:12:09.091
What are you doing?

1:12:10.124 --> 1:12:11.159
What are you doing?

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:35.316
Stop it!

1:12:35.950 --> 1:12:37.018
Stop!

1:12:43.390 --> 1:12:45.826
Son of a bitch!

1:12:58.339 --> 1:13:00.308
Major Dean! Goddamn it, serge!

1:13:00.340 --> 1:13:01.476
What are we doing?

1:13:01.509 --> 1:13:03.178
It's all bullshit!
It's killing him.

1:13:05.312 --> 1:13:08.382
God damn it, serge, make the call.
Serge, come on!

1:13:16.456 --> 1:13:18.325
Serge, make the fucking call!

1:13:23.164 --> 1:13:24.299
This is bullshit!

1:13:24.331 --> 1:13:25.508
Serge, what are you waiting for?

1:13:25.532 --> 1:13:26.901
Shoot him.

1:14:33.166 --> 1:14:35.068
What's happening to me?

1:14:35.102 --> 1:14:37.872
- Fuck!
- Get him out of my head!

1:14:38.272 --> 1:14:39.474
Stop it!

1:14:41.241 --> 1:14:42.343
Stop it!

1:15:45.372 --> 1:15:47.474
Get the fuck out of here!

1:15:51.077 --> 1:15:53.481
No!

1:16:49.836 --> 1:16:51.238
Approaching target.

1:16:57.344 --> 1:16:58.380
Laser on.

1:16:59.746 --> 1:17:00.781
Target is locked.

1:17:00.814 --> 1:17:02.650
Light him up.

1:17:02.683 --> 1:17:06.054
Copy that.
Three, two, one, rifle.

1:17:10.357 --> 1:17:13.528
Captain, the missile
did not reach the target.

1:17:13.561 --> 1:17:15.030
Something is blocking it.

1:17:18.499 --> 1:17:19.601
Captain, we're losing him.

1:17:25.705 --> 1:17:28.308
Copy...

1:18:13.286 --> 1:18:14.454
<i>The target still remains.</i>

1:18:14.487 --> 1:18:16.223
<i>It has created a shield
around it.</i>

1:18:16.256 --> 1:18:18.492
<i>I repeat,
the target still stands.</i>

1:18:32.772 --> 1:18:34.708
<i>Permission to abort.</i>

1:18:34.741 --> 1:18:36.643
<i>- Return to base.
- Copy that.</i>

1:19:04.470 --> 1:19:07.741
<i>We have unconfirmed
reports of shootings.</i>

1:19:07.775 --> 1:19:11.179
<i>And we do not know if there's
any causalities at this stage.</i>

1:19:11.211 --> 1:19:13.848
<i>And just when we thought things
couldn't get any worse,</i>

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:19.786
<i>we now have some reports that this thing
has apparently created a shield around it.</i>

1:19:19.820 --> 1:19:21.388
<i>And no missiles
can get through it.</i>

1:19:21.421 --> 1:19:22.798
<i>This is getting weird, and I
mean, it's getting really weird.</i>

1:19:22.822 --> 1:19:26.727
<i>Tom, look, I really want to
talk about this supernova guy.</i>

1:19:26.759 --> 1:19:28.027
<i>Supernova 94.</i>

1:19:28.062 --> 1:19:30.631
<i>Yeah, I mean, it sounds like
a user name, don't you think?</i>

1:19:30.664 --> 1:19:33.568
<i>Yeah, an unusual
user name for a terrorist.</i>

1:19:33.601 --> 1:19:36.737
<i>- A terrorist?</i>
- <i>A terrorist, a</i> desperado.

1:19:36.769 --> 1:19:37.838
<i>Or call him a</i> jihadi.

1:19:37.870 --> 1:19:41.275
<i>He's officially now
on the FBI's most wanted list.</i>

1:19:41.308 --> 1:19:42.676
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>

1:19:42.710 --> 1:19:46.981
<i>We've been trying to intentionally
send signals into space</i>

1:19:47.013 --> 1:19:48.481
<i>in search
of extraterrestrial life,</i>

1:19:48.515 --> 1:19:52.687
<i>all the SETI missions and the
fancy telescopes, the golden disk,</i>

1:19:52.719 --> 1:19:54.988
<i>but when an average Joe
makes contact with et,</i>

1:19:55.022 --> 1:19:58.893
<i>all of a sudden it's an act of terrorism.
This doesn't make sense.</i>

1:19:58.925 --> 1:19:59.970
<i>I mean, shouldn't they be
giving this guy</i>

1:19:59.994 --> 1:20:02.263
<i>a nobel prize or something?</i>

1:20:48.342 --> 1:20:50.644
<i>Now what
in the world is going on?</i>

1:20:50.678 --> 1:20:53.514
<i>There have been a number
of cases of strange events</i>

1:20:53.546 --> 1:20:56.517
<i>being reported
all around the world.</i>

1:20:56.549 --> 1:20:58.451
<i>Let's start
with these weird sounds.</i>

1:20:58.485 --> 1:21:00.021
<i>I invite you to listen carefully</i>

1:21:00.054 --> 1:21:01.622
<i>to the sounds
you're about to hear...</i>

1:21:01.655 --> 1:21:02.857
<i>Not sure what it is.</i>

1:21:04.390 --> 1:21:06.294
I think, I think the sky...

1:21:06.326 --> 1:21:07.704
<i>So what exactly
is everyone hearing?</i>

1:21:07.728 --> 1:21:09.897
<i>There have been
many theories, of course.</i>

1:21:09.929 --> 1:21:11.531
Something...

1:21:11.564 --> 1:21:13.534
Something really strange

1:21:13.567 --> 1:21:15.870
is, is happening
here on my dad's,

1:21:15.902 --> 1:21:17.370
my dad's property.

1:21:17.403 --> 1:21:19.674
There's...

1:21:21.541 --> 1:21:23.910
<i>There's these... these...</i>

1:21:23.943 --> 1:21:25.079
<i>These noises</i>

1:21:25.112 --> 1:21:26.247
<i>coming out of the woods.</i>

1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:27.891
<i>Last night, we could,
we could feel the ground shake.</i>

1:21:27.915 --> 1:21:30.651
<i>We've just received
some reports of a mysterious fog</i>

1:21:30.683 --> 1:21:32.385
<i>or some call it a thick smoke</i>

1:21:32.419 --> 1:21:34.530
<i>that's just appearing out of
nowhere and killing people.</i>

1:21:34.554 --> 1:21:35.990
<i>Reports of many explosions</i>

1:21:36.022 --> 1:21:37.924
<i>in the city of Bangalore, India.</i>

1:21:37.957 --> 1:21:39.326
<i>Officials are saying</i>

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:40.827
<i>there's been mass casualties</i>

1:21:40.861 --> 1:21:42.196
<i>with bodies everywhere.</i>

1:21:42.228 --> 1:21:44.764
The governor ordered shutting
down all non-essential businesses

1:21:44.798 --> 1:21:46.800
and telling people
to remain in their homes.

1:21:46.834 --> 1:21:49.870
<i>Millions of people
have gathered around the world</i>

1:21:49.902 --> 1:21:50.937
<i>and held mass prayer.</i>

1:21:50.970 --> 1:21:52.807
<i>Martial law has been declared</i>

1:21:52.839 --> 1:21:54.808
<i>as the military take control</i>

1:21:54.842 --> 1:21:56.509
<i>of all civilian governments.</i>

1:21:56.543 --> 1:21:58.545
I think, I think
they're already here.

1:21:58.579 --> 1:22:01.482
That supernova guy
works for NASA.

1:22:02.849 --> 1:22:04.050
<i>The ground has been shaking.</i>

1:22:04.084 --> 1:22:05.486
<i>All the crops are dying,</i>

1:22:05.518 --> 1:22:07.021
<i>this all happened overnight.</i>

1:22:07.054 --> 1:22:08.889
<i>There's something wrong
with the soil.</i>

1:22:08.921 --> 1:22:10.558
<i>Let me show you something.</i>

1:22:17.798 --> 1:22:19.467
<i>See? It's all rotten.</i>

1:22:19.500 --> 1:22:22.103
I can actually feel
the ground vibrating.

1:22:22.135 --> 1:22:24.138
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.

1:22:24.170 --> 1:22:25.638
We're on the edge

1:22:25.671 --> 1:22:27.107
of a mass...

1:22:27.140 --> 1:22:28.809
Extinction.

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:15.642
Max?

1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:35.268
<i>Who am I?</i>

1:29:39.039 --> 1:29:40.174
<i>What am I?</i>

1:29:42.174 --> 1:29:44.244
<i>Do you ever feel like
you're suffocating</i>

1:29:44.277 --> 1:29:46.380
<i>and want to crawl
out of your skin?</i>

1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:49.784
<i>But you're trapped
in your own body</i>

1:29:50.616 --> 1:29:53.152
<i>like you're abandoned</i>

1:29:53.186 --> 1:29:55.156
<i>and you don't belong anywhere.</i>

1:29:57.490 --> 1:29:59.927
<i>The world is coming to an end</i>

1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:03.397
<i>but why is it that I'm feeling
a sense of relief?</i>

1:30:04.129 --> 1:30:05.231
<i>Like i'm...</i>

1:30:06.131 --> 1:30:09.303
<i>I'm finally being
put out of my misery,</i>

1:30:09.335 --> 1:30:11.271
<i>like I can finally breathe.</i>

1:30:11.738 --> 1:30:13.840
<i>All the suffering.</i>

1:30:22.348 --> 1:30:23.616
<i>I used to think my answers</i>

1:30:23.650 --> 1:30:25.885
<i>lay somewhere in distant space</i>

1:30:25.919 --> 1:30:27.287
<i>among the stars.</i>

1:30:29.488 --> 1:30:31.357
<i>But for the first time</i>

1:30:31.390 --> 1:30:32.593
<i>I feel that the truth</i>

1:30:32.625 --> 1:30:35.295
<i>is finally within my reach.</i>

1:30:37.330 --> 1:30:38.933
<i>Right here.</i>

1:31:22.442 --> 1:31:24.078
It looks different.

1:31:25.577 --> 1:31:27.347
She is...

1:31:27.379 --> 1:31:29.215
Going through a process.

1:31:57.242 --> 1:31:58.312
What's happening?

1:32:00.479 --> 1:32:01.982
It's time.

1:32:29.576 --> 1:32:31.078
It's life...

1:32:32.144 --> 1:32:33.246
Growing.

1:32:34.546 --> 1:32:36.116
Beautiful, isn't it?

1:33:03.809 --> 1:33:06.112
How is this even possible?

1:33:06.146 --> 1:33:07.514
You made it possible.

1:33:08.814 --> 1:33:10.517
She was our only hope.

1:33:13.119 --> 1:33:15.389
Our only proof of existence.

1:33:16.522 --> 1:33:19.025
She was our last chance.

1:33:20.460 --> 1:33:22.229
You fought for her.

1:33:28.835 --> 1:33:31.138
You were involved
in an incident.

1:33:32.539 --> 1:33:34.241
You don't remember anything?

1:34:11.277 --> 1:34:14.048
Daddy, where are we going?

1:34:15.281 --> 1:34:17.317
We're going some place secret.

1:34:18.017 --> 1:34:20.153
Now I need you to be a good girl

1:34:20.186 --> 1:34:21.822
and don't tell anyone,

1:34:21.854 --> 1:34:23.122
I mean nobody,

1:34:23.156 --> 1:34:25.225
about our secret place.

1:34:25.258 --> 1:34:27.594
- Not even mommy, okay?
- Okay.

1:34:30.629 --> 1:34:32.065
I love you, honey.

1:34:33.532 --> 1:34:34.733
Tell me more about it.

1:34:34.767 --> 1:34:36.403
It was captured and killed

1:34:36.436 --> 1:34:37.269
early this morning

1:34:37.304 --> 1:34:39.606
at 0400 hours
in northern Alaska, sir.

1:34:40.807 --> 1:34:42.675
An unidentified flying object

1:34:42.709 --> 1:34:44.311
was reported by the locals.

1:34:44.344 --> 1:34:45.712
I see.

1:34:45.745 --> 1:34:47.680
Welcome to area 51, senator.

1:34:49.381 --> 1:34:51.518
Now, you need to wait
out here, sweetheart.

1:34:51.851 --> 1:34:53.219
Okay?

1:34:53.887 --> 1:34:55.589
I'll be back in a minute.

1:34:55.621 --> 1:34:56.656
I love you.

1:35:53.979 --> 1:35:55.615
My god, it's a beast.

1:35:55.647 --> 1:35:58.450
- You sure it's...
- Dead as a doornail, sir.

1:35:58.483 --> 1:36:01.487
It seemed that it was
trying to plant something.

1:36:01.521 --> 1:36:04.724
It was incredibly strong,
hostile but highly intelligent

1:36:04.756 --> 1:36:08.195
with a high-tech spaceship
and advanced weapons.

1:36:08.228 --> 1:36:09.338
Thanks
to the earth's atmosphere,

1:36:09.362 --> 1:36:11.897
it appears they haven't
adapted to our environment,

1:36:11.930 --> 1:36:13.567
which slowed it down, sir.

1:36:13.599 --> 1:36:16.637
Oh, and they have
an ability to fly, sir.

1:37:11.590 --> 1:37:14.494
<i>Our home was no longer
habitable for our species.</i>

1:37:19.831 --> 1:37:22.602
Hey! Get up!

1:37:22.634 --> 1:37:25.304
God damn it, kid, you're not
supposed to be in here.

1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:28.441
Where was she?

1:37:28.473 --> 1:37:30.343
She was in the bathroom, sir.

1:37:54.701 --> 1:37:57.837
My god, what is that?

1:37:57.870 --> 1:37:59.973
- Is that...
- It's a blueprint.

1:38:00.005 --> 1:38:01.607
Looks like a rocket.

1:38:04.110 --> 1:38:06.545
She's eight years old
for god's sake.

1:38:07.013 --> 1:38:07.847
What kind of school...

1:38:07.879 --> 1:38:09.815
I don't think
it's a school project.

1:38:09.848 --> 1:38:12.751
She seems to be
showing an interest in science

1:38:12.785 --> 1:38:14.921
and the extraterrestrial life.

1:38:14.954 --> 1:38:16.923
<i>She's also becoming
more isolated.</i>

1:38:16.955 --> 1:38:20.326
<i>She has this ability
to manipulate</i>

1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:25.365
not just the students
but also some of the teachers.

1:38:26.198 --> 1:38:28.367
<i>She also says that
she's an alien</i>

1:38:28.401 --> 1:38:30.504
<i>and she wants to go home.</i>

1:38:33.705 --> 1:38:34.807
Hello?

1:38:37.844 --> 1:38:40.514
Is anyone there? This is...

1:38:47.387 --> 1:38:49.656
This is supernova 94.

1:38:50.055 --> 1:38:51.590
Do you copy?

1:39:17.616 --> 1:39:19.785
You said
she was building a rocket.

1:39:21.086 --> 1:39:22.888
Who have you been talking to?

1:39:22.921 --> 1:39:25.558
There are some bad people
out there. You hear me, Lauren?

1:39:25.590 --> 1:39:27.626
I need you to put a lock
on this thing.

1:39:27.893 --> 1:39:28.928
That's it.

1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:31.430
You are not allowed
in the shed anymore, missy.

1:39:49.781 --> 1:39:52.485
<i>God damn it!
What is wrong with you?</i>

1:39:52.518 --> 1:39:54.921
<i>What have I told you about
painting on the walls?</i>

1:40:02.061 --> 1:40:03.763
You will die

1:40:03.795 --> 1:40:06.799
<i>a most horrible death.</i>

1:40:06.832 --> 1:40:07.901
<i>We have abilities.</i>

1:40:09.669 --> 1:40:10.570
<i>Senator,</i>

1:40:10.603 --> 1:40:13.005
<i>we found a mysterious
new form of DNA</i>

1:40:13.039 --> 1:40:14.573
<i>in Lauren's blood cells.</i>

1:40:15.107 --> 1:40:16.643
<i>We can't really figure it out.</i>

1:40:16.675 --> 1:40:18.544
<i>She's changing
into something else.</i>

1:40:18.577 --> 1:40:21.580
<i>It's like she's half-human
and becoming...</i>

1:40:21.613 --> 1:40:24.451
<i>Shh, you might want to
keep your voice down, doc.</i>

1:40:24.483 --> 1:40:25.627
<i>I know she's in the other room,</i>

1:40:25.651 --> 1:40:27.821
<i>but she can hear
through the walls.</i>

1:41:20.005 --> 1:41:21.607
Welcome home.

1:41:47.799 --> 1:41:53.105
A space composed
that's 78.09% nitrogen,

1:41:53.138 --> 1:41:56.808
20.95% oxygen,

1:41:56.842 --> 1:42:00.146
0.93% argon,

1:42:00.179 --> 1:42:04.150
and 0.04% carbon dioxide,

1:42:04.183 --> 1:42:06.019
and a small amount
of other gases.

1:42:06.052 --> 1:42:07.521
<i>Who is this?</i>

1:42:08.254 --> 1:42:10.857
Kid, can you hear me?

1:42:13.058 --> 1:42:14.159
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

1:42:14.192 --> 1:42:15.294
<i>Ask her her name.</i>

1:42:15.327 --> 1:42:17.696
This is the goddamn CIA.

1:42:17.729 --> 1:42:19.732
She called herself supernova 94.

1:42:19.764 --> 1:42:22.035
- What the hell is super...
- I don't know, Jack.

1:42:22.067 --> 1:42:22.968
<i>We're trying to decode</i>

1:42:23.003 --> 1:42:25.037
<i>sensitive
military operations here.</i>

1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:37.684
<i>Strange objects
are appearing around the world.</i>

1:42:37.717 --> 1:42:39.952
<i>What began in Indiana
and alberta, Canada,</i>

1:42:39.986 --> 1:42:42.854
<i>has now occurred in several
places across the globe,</i>

1:42:42.888 --> 1:42:46.593
<i>including Australia
and Greenland.</i>

1:42:46.625 --> 1:42:49.861
<i>They're appearing everywhere,
in forests,</i>

1:42:49.894 --> 1:42:54.666
<i>the Sahara desert, farms,
lakes, major cities.</i>

1:42:54.700 --> 1:42:56.336
<i>They are everywhere.</i>

1:42:56.369 --> 1:42:58.972
<i>Well, I've seen on TV
and a lot of video</i>

1:42:59.004 --> 1:43:01.673
<i>that has been shown to me,
it's the shape of an egg.</i>

1:43:01.706 --> 1:43:04.076
<i>The strange noises
once reported are now confirmed</i>

1:43:04.110 --> 1:43:07.746
<i>to be coming out of these
mysterious egg-shaped objects.</i>

1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:09.349
<i>There many wild theories.</i>

1:43:09.381 --> 1:43:10.950
<i>Some say they arose
from the ground,</i>

1:43:10.982 --> 1:43:12.828
<i>while others say they were
placed there overnight</i>

1:43:12.852 --> 1:43:14.687
<i>by a giant alien spacecraft.
It's crazy.</i>

1:43:14.719 --> 1:43:16.822
<i>This could be an act
of alien invasion on...</i>

1:43:16.856 --> 1:43:18.592
<i>We don't understand what it is.</i>

1:43:19.526 --> 1:43:21.361
<i>I mean, this is it.
They're here.</i>

1:43:21.393 --> 1:43:22.428
<i>They're inside those pods</i>

1:43:22.461 --> 1:43:24.863
<i>and they're ready to come out
any second now.</i>

1:43:24.897 --> 1:43:26.165
<i>They've risen.</i>

1:43:26.197 --> 1:43:27.208
<i>I guess the big question is</i>

1:43:27.232 --> 1:43:29.369
<i>how will they survive
earth's environment.</i>

1:43:40.278 --> 1:43:43.215
<i>It's like doomsday as they
call it in the Bible or koran...</i>

1:43:43.249 --> 1:43:44.751
<i>I haven't really seen it,</i>

1:43:44.784 --> 1:43:46.786
<i>but those who've seen it
from a distance</i>

1:43:46.818 --> 1:43:50.223
<i>describe it as a wave
of this energy or smoke</i>

1:43:50.255 --> 1:43:53.860
<i>that's just bursting through
the towns and killing people.</i>

1:43:53.893 --> 1:43:55.662
<i>It's actually
very heart wrenching</i>

1:43:55.695 --> 1:43:56.806
<i>because you know
a lot of these people</i>

1:43:56.830 --> 1:43:59.098
<i>didn't get a chance to evacuate
when this happened.</i>

1:43:59.130 --> 1:44:02.134
They're creating a habitable
environment for themselves

1:44:02.168 --> 1:44:03.737
<i>before they pop out.</i>

1:44:04.269 --> 1:44:06.171
Where do they come from?

1:44:06.205 --> 1:44:07.874
<i>These pods</i>

1:44:07.906 --> 1:44:10.876
<i>are connected to these roots.</i>

1:44:10.910 --> 1:44:12.679
They contaminated the soil.

1:44:12.711 --> 1:44:15.048
They were growing
right beneath us.

1:44:15.714 --> 1:44:18.651
But the main question
still remains.

1:44:19.518 --> 1:44:22.021
<i>Where did these roots come from?</i>

1:44:25.057 --> 1:44:30.729
<i>Earth no longer supports
life for the human species.</i>

1:44:31.796 --> 1:44:33.165
<i>The planet has transformed</i>

1:44:33.198 --> 1:44:35.168
<i>and an evolution has begun.</i>

1:44:36.235 --> 1:44:38.103
<i>There was nowhere to run</i>

1:44:38.137 --> 1:44:40.005
<i>and nowhere to hide.</i>

1:44:40.039 --> 1:44:43.443
<i>All earthly species
and plants became extinct.</i>

1:44:43.476 --> 1:44:45.116
- <i>Nothing survived.</i>
- It's been six months

1:44:45.143 --> 1:44:48.280
since the invasion.
I'm on my last oxygen tank.

1:44:48.313 --> 1:44:49.915
I don't want to die.

1:45:21.045 --> 1:45:23.048
<i>It's a different world
out here now.</i>

1:45:26.184 --> 1:45:27.720
<i>As for me,</i>

1:45:29.854 --> 1:45:32.157
<i>my journey
finally came to an end.</i>

1:45:37.830 --> 1:45:39.232
<i>I'm finally home.</i>
