ADAMA: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.776 --> 00:30.196
Congratulations on making
Captain. Sorry I wasn't there.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.408
Thank you, sir.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.951
How's your mother?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.661
Getting married.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.208
In the mountains north of here
there's this little stream.

00:42.292 --> 00:46.087
The water is so clear, it's
like looking through glass.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.757
I'm thinking
of building a cabin.

00:51.885 --> 00:52.885
APOLLO: You and Cally
have a fight?

00:52.970 --> 00:55.722
You didn't hear us? I figured
we should have sold tickets.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.307
To marriage,
why we build bars.

01:01.437 --> 01:05.606
It's not too late
for Baltar to just disappear.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.985
I can't do that.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.655
For all his crimes,
he's one of us.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.450
So what happens next?

01:16.744 --> 01:18.453
We give him his trial.

see you, Admiral. Enter.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.091
You're up early.

02:14.176 --> 02:17.512
Couldn't sleep, so I thought
I'd make myself useful.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.893

02:54.925 --> 02:56.843
It's okay.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.637
I don't know. Here.
Just double check it for me.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.349
I think Daddy's
getting good at this.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.601
Daddy's tired
of burning his wrists.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.604
We've got to get ready.
We've got morning watch.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.523
I thought we were spending
the day with Nicky.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.568
Yeah. So did I, until Laskin
and Perry called in sick.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.246
We barely get
any time off as it is.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.498
Cal, you know the deck
is short-handed.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.085
The deck has been
short-handed since we got here.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.589
All I know is frakking daycare
workers see more of Nicky than we do.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.383
Yeah, well, until the daycare workers
figure out how to strip a Viper,

03:37.467 --> 03:39.427
this is the way it's gonna be.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.512
Hey, buddy. Come here.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.850
I know, I know, I know. You
just laid down, too, didn't you?

03:45.934 --> 03:48.144
Come here. I got you.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.733
Here you go.
I'll take him to daycare.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.653
What are you doing?

03:57.738 --> 04:01.574
Hey! Forgetting something?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.621
What's on duty schedule?

04:06.705 --> 04:10.750
Nothing sexy. CO2
scrubber's out near sick bay.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.668
Broken water line
in the galley.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.961
Oh...

04:14.171 --> 04:16.672
Now that most of our Vipers
are out of dry-dock,

04:16.757 --> 04:20.343

at the servos in airlock 12.

Is that it?

04:40.197 --> 04:44.033
You can use some time for
yourself. I can handle first watch.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.036
I'll be keeping my schedule.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.039
This is just another day.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.793
CAROLANNE: Just another day?

04:53.877 --> 04:57.004
Maybe I should have
married him instead of you.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.634
ADAMA: I could
have sold tickets to that.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.901
We had some good times.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.073
But more bad.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.584
CAROLANNE: But you keep
bringing me back, anyway.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.129
Just this one day.

05:38.213 --> 05:41.257
Year after year. Only
thing I can't understand is

05:41.675 --> 05:42.758
why?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.067
Neither do I.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.736

Private.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.117
Jaffee, sir.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.457
Would there be
anything else, Admiral?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.751
That will be all, Jaffee.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.719
CAROLANNE: It's going to be a
long day. ADAMA: It always is.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.604
Morning, Chief.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.068
Is Nicky okay?
Yeah, he's fine.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.863
First time he didn't cry when
I dropped him off at daycare.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.452
So, Figurski, you gonna at least
pretend to do something today?

06:52.162 --> 06:53.829
Frakking scrubber.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.457
Takes Adama two seconds
to sign off on an order

06:56.541 --> 06:58.584
that's gonna take us
all day to finish.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.711
Oh, it will take you
all day, anyhow.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.215
Seelix. Cally. You're
with me. Airlock 12.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.514
Seelix, can you get the door? Yep.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.983
This place is
a frakking mess.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.693
Yeah. The Cylons
blew the hell out of it.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.948
Nobody's been down here since
damage-control plugged the holes.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.075
Seelix, can you hear me there? Yeah.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.453
You want to see if you can find the
electrical diagram for the airlock?

07:34.538 --> 07:39.291
Okay. Ooh, I did find
somebody's year-old lunch.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.841
He didn't even cry?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.301
Cal, I told you,
Nicky is fine.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.637
Yeah, and anybody could have
dragged a tool bag down here.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.930
It didn't have to be me.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.431
Yeah, well, it had
to be somebody.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.976
You know these gearing systems
better than anybody.

07:57.060 --> 08:00.104
What do you want me to do? Give you
special treatment because you're my wife?

08:00.188 --> 08:02.356
How would that look?
I don't care!

08:09.156 --> 08:11.031
We keep trying to pretend
like nothing's changed,

08:11.116 --> 08:13.993
that our lives are exactly like they
were before we went to New Caprica.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.578
But it is different.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.999
We're married.
We have a son.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.751
Yeah, it's just
a little rough patch.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.923
What if rough patches
are all we have left?

08:30.635 --> 08:33.179
We swore we were gonna raise
Nicky ourselves, remember?

08:33.263 --> 08:34.930
Yeah, well.
We swore a lot of things.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.724
The Cylons didn't exactly
cooperate, did they?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.518
You want to give me
those wire cutters?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.812
(ALARM SOUNDING)

08:45.901 --> 08:47.401
What the hell?

08:48.445 --> 08:50.112
For frak's sake.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.366
Seelix? What are you
doing? Open the door.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.118
I didn't do anything.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.790
SEELIX: Chief, I'm picking up a
pressure differential in there.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.544
It's nothing drastic.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.005
But you guys
are definitely losing air.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.674
Oh, it doesn't
take much.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.552
Once the airflow sensors
detect a big enough leak,

09:13.637 --> 09:15.638
all the inner doors are
designed to drop automatically.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.640
It's just a safety
precaution.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.558
I feel safer already.

09:19.643 --> 09:23.229
Wait a second. Are you saying
that the hull's been breached?

09:24.231 --> 09:27.566
Well, "breach" is a bit dramatic,
but the air's going somewhere.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.736
One of these patches must
have cracked when we came in.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.531
Soon as we plug it and restore
the pressure, the door should open.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.534
Then we can pull the work orders
on whoever made these frakking welds

09:37.619 --> 09:40.246
and kick their asses.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.081
Yeah, well, the most important
thing is to keep breathing,

09:42.165 --> 09:44.333
so let's just find the leak.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.168
Ah...

09:47.754 --> 09:50.381
This is it, right here.
This one.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.504
Are you still doing that?
The memory exercises?

11:13.506 --> 11:17.009
Do you really think they expect
you to know all of their names?

11:17.093 --> 11:19.178
You never change, do you?

11:19.971 --> 11:23.932
(CHUCKLES) One of the joys
of being long dead, I suppose.

11:24.476 --> 11:27.728
Now, hurry. You're going
to be late meeting Laura.

11:32.108 --> 11:36.362
CAROLANNE: Maybe she's got a thing for
bad boys. She wouldn't be the first.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.406
She's the President
of the Twelve Colonies.

11:39.491 --> 11:43.243
Oh. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Of course.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.331
Since you've created one
God-like facade for yourself,

11:47.415 --> 11:50.042
why not invent
another one for her?

11:50.126 --> 11:53.212
It's another excuse
to keep your distance.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.716
Admiral.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.676
Madam President.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.304
How are you?
Very good.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.474
I'm sorry. I'm sure this all could
have been done over the wireless,

12:05.558 --> 12:08.060
but very frankly, I was going a
little stir crazy on Colonial One

12:08.144 --> 12:09.520
and I had to get out.

12:09.604 --> 12:13.482
Deep space pilots
used to call it OBE.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.276
What's "OBE"?
"Overcome by events. "

12:16.361 --> 12:19.863
And you're always
welcome here. You know that.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.949
Well, you may not feel that
way after you finish this.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.826
Tory actually drew up
an agenda.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.331
Baltar again.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.334
Mmm.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.588
Can't we just give him
back to the Cylons?

12:36.673 --> 12:40.092
You know how much I love
that idea. Unfortunately,

12:40.176 --> 12:42.594
given what little I was able
to glean from the Caprica Six,

12:42.679 --> 12:45.389
I don't think the Cylons would
take him back, so we're stuck.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.767
Fine. Then try the son of
a bitch and be done with it.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.437
We have to give him a trial,
but under what law?

12:51.521 --> 12:53.605
Caprican? Picon? Tauron?

12:53.690 --> 12:57.568
Do we give him a jury trial?
Do we set up a tribunal?

12:57.652 --> 13:02.281
We don't even have anything closely
resembling a comprehensive law library.

13:02.365 --> 13:05.617
And this fleet is not exactly
brimming with legal talent.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.705
You bring lawyers into this, they're
gonna drag you around for months.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.916
Wasn't your father
an attorney on Caprica?

13:13.001 --> 13:15.961
Yes. And I told you that I didn't
get along with him very well.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.546
Oh, right. Okay.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.842
I'm ready to set up an
organizing committee, but frankly,

13:21.926 --> 13:26.096
trying to get a room full of legal scholars
to stay on task is like herding cats,

13:26.181 --> 13:30.184
and so I need to set up
a chairman of this committee,

13:30.268 --> 13:31.810
somebody who can make
a hard decision

13:31.895 --> 13:35.230
and who won't get seduced and
bogged down by all the legalese.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.232
Do you have a candidate?
As a matter of fact, I do.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.610
I was thinking Lee.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.571
Like grandfather, like grandson,
perhaps. What do you think?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.990
I'm not gonna say he's
incapable of handling it,

13:45.074 --> 13:49.620
but he's never shown
any type of interest in law.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.498
I know, but here's the thing.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.458
We can use the lawyers
to parse the law,

13:54.542 --> 13:56.919
but we really need people who
actually know the difference

13:57.003 --> 14:00.088
between right and wrong.
That's Lee.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.882
I'll talk to him.
Good.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.468
Also, Admiral?

14:05.386 --> 14:10.182
I was wondering if you mind if I stayed
on your ship for the rest of the day.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.601
Please. By all means.

14:15.897 --> 14:19.358
This is very difficult
for me to say, but

14:19.442 --> 14:21.568
I'm going to go
to the gym.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.864
Prepare yourself.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.617
On its best days, it smells
like the inside of a shoe.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.952
(LAUGHS)

14:31.246 --> 14:33.455
(BEEPING)

14:38.253 --> 14:39.211
See if there's
another patch in there.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.589
I want to double up on this
one and make sure it holds.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.633
Come on, Cal. Faster is
better. The sooner we do this,

14:44.759 --> 14:48.762
the sooner we can get out of
here. I heard you the first time.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.397
(LAUGHING)

14:59.774 --> 15:00.941
(QUIETING)

15:01.859 --> 15:04.236
CAROLANNE: You're getting
better at ignoring all of that.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.739
That sudden hush,
those sidelong glances.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.158
That really used
to get to you.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.413
Don't ever recall being able
to intimidate you.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.664
That's right.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.500
But I knew you long before
you were the Admiral.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.669
Back when you were just Bill.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.964
My husband who wasn't there.
The father who left.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.674
Just Bill.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.927
Who is Bill Adama, anyway?
Still a good question.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.722
I wonder if
I'll get an answer.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.017
Forty-nine days
without a sighting.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.395
Maybe we finally
scared the toasters off.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.899
Oh, yeah, Narcho. Your crap flying
has put the fear of the Gods in them.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.863
What's up, buddy?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.956
What's the matter
with you?

15:58.041 --> 16:01.585
Sorry. I've got
the weirdest rash.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.878
Really?

16:03.671 --> 16:05.881
Hope she was
worth it, buddy.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.680
Ten-hut.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.771
At ease.

16:25.193 --> 16:28.445
Before we get started,
I want a show of hands.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.073
How many of you boneheads
know how to count?

16:37.580 --> 16:41.083
Because I keep hearing numbers
being thrown around the hangar deck.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.460
Forty-seven, then 48,

16:43.544 --> 16:46.672
now 49 days since
our last enemy contact.

16:46.756 --> 16:50.676
Now, I realize that any higher
math is probably beyond most of you.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.887
So, I'm going to make this
real simple for you.

16:57.141 --> 17:01.770
One is the only number
you need to remember.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.440
Because all it takes is for
one pilot to let his guard down,

17:05.525 --> 17:08.193
one ECO to miss
a dradis contact,

17:08.277 --> 17:11.154
and suddenly,
the Cylons are on top of us.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.033
That's when people die.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.412
ADAMA: He's like both of us.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.628
Proud, stubborn and angry.

17:27.964 --> 17:32.300
But he's coming into his own,
especially in the last few months.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.636
CAROLANNE: Don't tell me.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.640
Tell him.
He knows.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.267
He knows what?

17:41.477 --> 17:45.355
That the Admiral's going to give
him a good performance review?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.024
Or that his father loves him?

17:49.902 --> 17:53.155
Don't tell me the Admiral's
facade extends to Lee, too.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.575
APOLLO: Formation flying,

17:56.659 --> 17:58.744
deflection shooting, tactics,

17:58.828 --> 18:03.248
doing touch-and-goes, until
every last one of you hits an OK3.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.294
Red and blue sections will go
first. Yellow and green will follow.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.546
Skids up in 10 minutes.
Dismissed!

18:24.479 --> 18:26.646
Starbuck, if you've got a problem,
I don't want to hear about it.

18:26.731 --> 18:27.856
Mmm!

18:28.274 --> 18:32.569
My only problem is that you didn't
preach that sermon a week ago.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.613
You might want to find
some new material, though.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.866
The old man's been using that "one
fatal mistake" line since we got here.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.244
Well, if you're gonna steal,
steal from the best.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.540
Sir.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.756
Pretty tough on them today.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.300
Well, a kick in the butt
is worth a thousand words.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.803
Gods know you kicked
mine enough.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.680
Everything okay?

19:01.390 --> 19:03.642
Yeah, it's been one
of those mornings.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.812
The President wants to take the
fast track on Baltar's trial.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.439
She's looking for someone to
take charge of the preliminaries,

19:09.524 --> 19:12.025
help cobble together
the legal framework.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.194
She wants me
to assign you.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.405
You're kidding.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.575
Interested?

19:21.077 --> 19:22.661
More surprised.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.330
Did she say why
she asked for me?

19:25.414 --> 19:28.583
Well, she's gonna need
someone that she can trust.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.877
You definitely fit that.

19:33.005 --> 19:38.718
I remember when you were younger,
you'd go visit your grandfather's house.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.930
You were fascinated with
his papers and his law books.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.307
(CHUCKLING)

19:45.226 --> 19:48.144
And there was me,
thinking I was being sly,

19:48.229 --> 19:51.398
sneaking off into his office
all by myself.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.653
You know, I guess it's a pipe dream
now, but for five minutes there,

19:56.737 --> 19:59.281
I really did consider "lawyer"

20:00.283 --> 20:05.370
as one of the dozen careers that I could
go into before I joined the service.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.290
Hmm.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.500
I never knew that.

20:12.628 --> 20:17.966
Well, it was probably during
one of my "angry at Dad" phases.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.721
Anyway, it's impossible.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.640
Even if I wanted to help out,
there's no way.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.936
CAG's duty's already 24/7,
even on a light week.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.231
Yeah. I assumed that.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.150
NARCHO: Major?
We're ready for you.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.152
Excuse me.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.376
(ALARM SOUNDING)

20:55.338 --> 20:57.631
Yeah, well,
one's gonna have to do.

20:57.715 --> 21:00.175
Seelix? Check the pressure.
If that patch holds,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.427
we're gonna equalize in a few
minutes. This door's gonna open.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.637
Okay.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.142
(POPPING)

21:09.226 --> 21:10.435
(WIND WHISTLING)

21:10.519 --> 21:11.937
Oh, my Gods.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.953
How are they doing?
Still alive.

21:29.330 --> 21:33.208
WOMAN ON P.A.: This is a Condition
3 alert. Full breach on Deck 14.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.381
Chief.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.634
Admiral?

21:42.718 --> 21:45.679
I seem to have turned this
into a full-blown fubar.

21:46.889 --> 21:50.141
You'd be doing us a hell of a
favor to get those doors open.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.188
We gotta get them
out of there.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.900
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

22:09.245 --> 22:12.247
The airlock is designed to lock down
if the pressure decreases unexpectedly.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.708
So, as soon as that patch...
I know the system.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.335
We have redundancies,
we have backups...

22:17.420 --> 22:19.546
The manual override is down.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.924
There is no way of getting
those inner doors to open.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.677
The thing must have taken heavy
damage on the way out of New Caprica.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.845
Whole ship's
taken a pounding.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.764
We need six weeks in dry-dock
just to hammer out the dings,

22:29.849 --> 22:31.599
let alone tackle
the structural damage.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.767
How much time
do they have?

22:32.852 --> 22:36.896
From a leak that size, they'll be out
of air in half an hour, maybe less.

22:36.981 --> 22:41.526
Those are blast doors. It would take
at least an hour to cut through them.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.280
TIGH: Why don't we put explosives
in the observation booth?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.531
Blow the glass,
pull them out...

22:46.615 --> 22:49.409
No, that glass is strong enough
to withstand a tylium explosion.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.161
Anything strong enough
to take out the glass

22:51.245 --> 22:54.039
will take out Tyrol and Cally
at the same time.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.374
I need a rescue plan,

22:57.418 --> 22:59.085
not excuses.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.727
Seven seconds.

23:15.811 --> 23:19.064
And another 10 to re-pressurize, since
we'll be doing this in open space.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.899
That's pushing it.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.525
All right, this might
be a stupid question,

23:22.610 --> 23:24.569
but has anyone ever tried
a rescue like this before?

23:24.653 --> 23:25.904
No one has ever
been crazy enough.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.448
Doesn't matter. We're out
of time. Prep for launch.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.908
We've only got
18 minutes left.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.160
All right, let's go.
We're on.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.329
(AIR HISSING)

23:34.497 --> 23:36.873
(ALARM SOUNDING)

24:12.493 --> 24:13.701
CALLY: Galen.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.919
ADAMA:
Airlock's still jammed, Chief.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.713
Overrides are not responding.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.261
Guess we're kind of
running out of options.

24:31.345 --> 24:34.347
I'm gonna take you out
through the front door.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.895
You're going to put
a ship out there,

24:40.980 --> 24:43.064
rig up some kind
of docking collar?

24:43.149 --> 24:48.236
You'll be out of air in a few
minutes. There's no time for a collar.

24:50.406 --> 24:54.409
Sir, if you're talking about an
EVA, we don't have pressure suits.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.244
We don't have a choice.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.581
Athena's going to position her
Raptor in front of the airlock,

24:59.665 --> 25:01.166
hatch open.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.084
I'm gonna blow the bolts
right off of that door.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.588
And when it opens up, you're
gonna have to jump for it.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.923
Now, listen to me,
both of you.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.592
You can do this.

25:11.093 --> 25:15.013
People have been able to live up to
a minute in exposure without a suit.

25:17.558 --> 25:18.892
Admiral, I don't know.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.436
We'll talk later. Get ready.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.650
WOMAN: Athena, Galactica,
you have priority clearance.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.486
All other traffic
is being waved away.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.696
CALLY: Wait.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.449
What about Nicky?

25:34.533 --> 25:38.161
Admiral's right.
We have to prep.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.917
I'll move everything away
from here to the door.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.585
Galen?

25:45.669 --> 25:47.337
We both know what happens
to kids in the fleet

25:47.421 --> 25:50.089
when their parents
aren't there for them.

25:50.174 --> 25:53.176
Apollo and Dee.
They'll take care of him.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.971
No. No pilots.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.474
He's not going
through this twice.

26:09.443 --> 26:10.526
Sir?

26:14.281 --> 26:16.324
There's a civilian family.

26:17.076 --> 26:22.288
Mother's name is Susan
Stettler. She has a little girl.

26:22.373 --> 26:26.334
If anything happens to us...
I'll see to it.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.472
(CRYING)

26:42.685 --> 26:46.479
(SHIVERING) I was being
selfish. I wanted you with me.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.274
Like old times.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.360
I didn't think about Nick.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.572
(CALLY CRYING)

26:56.824 --> 26:58.157
I'm sorry.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.874
Admiral's gonna get us
out of here, okay?

27:08.002 --> 27:09.627
We're gonna
take care of Nicky.

27:16.385 --> 27:20.138
More than a few seconds out there,
and we're talking severe exposure.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.974
Decompression sickness. At
the very least, hypothermia.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.684
They could freeze to death.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.687
Make sure Cottle's got his
hyperbaric chamber ready.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.615
CALLY: I'm sorry.

27:58.052 --> 28:02.180
Galactica, Apollo. Bringing
Raptor into position at B1-12.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.975
TYROL: Put your mask on.

28:24.078 --> 28:27.163
All right, listen up. We
don't have time to hang back

28:27.247 --> 28:28.539
until the airlock
doors blow.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.542
So we're liable to experience some
turbulence from the residual oxygen,

28:31.627 --> 28:33.544
maybe even some
shrapnel hits.

28:33.629 --> 28:37.048
Athena, you're going to have
to be ready to compensate.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.508
I'm on it, Major.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.219
I'll hold position until
Chief and Cally are secured.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.304
Let's just get this done.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.437
Galactica, Apollo.
Raptor door is open.

28:51.522 --> 28:54.148
We're standing by.
Ready to execute.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.526
Chief, Cally,

28:56.610 --> 28:59.153
Raptor's in position.
We've got to go now.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.281
Get ready to blow
the hatch on my mark.

29:02.366 --> 29:07.370
Okay. No matter what,
you hold on to me.

29:07.454 --> 29:10.623
And don't let go. Okay.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.544
Three...

29:23.303 --> 29:24.679
Two...

29:31.270 --> 29:33.521
One. Do it.

29:37.860 --> 29:38.901
(BEEPING)

29:38.986 --> 29:41.863
APOLLO: Watch out!
Bank right! Bank right!

29:45.033 --> 29:46.451
ATHENA: We're in position!

29:47.453 --> 29:48.995
Pull up your nose!
Pull up!

29:49.079 --> 29:51.539
Got it!
Hold it right there!

29:58.213 --> 30:01.007
Galactica, Apollo. Raptor
is secured and pressurized.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.300
They are in rough shape.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.927
We've got to get them
to sick bay right away.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.824
Come in.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.710
So, any word
on Chief and Cally?

30:37.794 --> 30:42.298
They're alive, but Doc Cottle is
still evaluating their condition.

30:45.594 --> 30:49.096
So, are you going to tell me
what's going on with you?

30:52.768 --> 30:54.435
It's this day.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.857
My Gods,
your wedding anniversary.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.402
I had totally forgotten.

31:03.487 --> 31:07.949
Probably seems foolish, especially
the way it all ended up, but...

31:09.785 --> 31:11.244
Still...

31:13.789 --> 31:16.541
It still means
something to me.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.834
We've never
talked about it.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.294
The divorce.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.673
Your mother.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.135
It was a bad time
for all of us.

31:28.220 --> 31:33.975
Your mother gave you and your
brother a home, stability.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.562
Dad, I know you want
to believe that, but...

31:40.274 --> 31:43.359
You know what? Forget it.
It was a long time ago.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.031
You have something to say,
Son, just say it.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.286
Dad, we had four walls.

31:55.289 --> 31:56.539
But stability?

31:58.375 --> 32:02.962
My Gods, you know what Mom was
like. I mean, the mood swings...

32:03.046 --> 32:04.463
It's why you left her.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.215
We had problems, but...

32:06.341 --> 32:10.303
She cared deeply for you and your
brother. Things changed after you left.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.891
And, I mean, there were times
when she lost control.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.560
CAROLANNE:
Don't listen to him, Bill.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.062
APOLLO: She would try
and apologize.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.399
She would promise that she
would make things better.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.276
But then she would
just start drinking.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.361
And then all of her good
intentions would just go flying

32:27.487 --> 32:28.613
out the frakking window.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.532
ADAMA: Is it true?

32:31.617 --> 32:33.618
I can't believe
you'd even ask me that!

32:33.702 --> 32:36.454
Damn it. Is it true?

32:36.538 --> 32:39.332
APOLLO: And then, one day,
finally, the apologies even stopped.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.708
That's enough.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.128
CAROLANNE:
You walked out on me!

32:44.212 --> 32:47.214
You walked out on me!

32:47.299 --> 32:51.344
The brilliant commander, who could
lead all of his men into combat,

32:51.428 --> 32:54.805
but he couldn't find a way
to live with his own family!

32:54.890 --> 32:57.600
We never lived anywhere
for more than six months!

32:57.684 --> 33:00.519
Just following you around
from one base to another!

33:00.604 --> 33:02.355
Waiting for you
to come home!

33:02.439 --> 33:05.441
But you weren't here
for any of us!

33:05.525 --> 33:10.029
It was always whatever was
easiest for the great Adama!

33:10.113 --> 33:14.033
They needed you.
They were our children.

33:17.788 --> 33:20.081
They needed a father.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.213
All through
your glorious career,

33:27.297 --> 33:30.549
you have prided yourself
on being a leader of men,

33:30.634 --> 33:31.967
judging people,

33:32.052 --> 33:34.679
always making the hard call.

33:34.763 --> 33:38.349
But when it came to the
biggest decision of your life,

33:38.433 --> 33:42.728
oh, Bill, you blew it.

33:42.813 --> 33:47.525
We were wrong for each other from day
one, but you just couldn't accept that.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.695
That's it. That's why
you keep calling me back.

33:51.697 --> 33:55.741
Because if you had
made that mistake,

33:57.369 --> 34:02.540
it would just call into question
all of your other decisions.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.975
ADAMA: She was still
your mother, Lee.

34:22.352 --> 34:23.728
I loved her.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.856
APOLLO: I believe you.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.443
I just don't think
she ever loved you.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.545
He's right over here.

34:53.008 --> 34:54.133
Hey.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.095
I dropped by daycare.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.222
Somebody wanted to see you.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.517
Who's that?
Hey, little man.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.523
How is she doing? Doc
Cottle says she'll be okay,

35:09.608 --> 35:12.735
but it's gonna be a while
before she's 100 percent.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.338
Yeah?

35:34.049 --> 35:37.760
(NICHOLAS CRYING) Yeah,
I'm fine. I know. Come here.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.222
I've got you.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.814
You want to go see Mommy?
Want to go see Mommy?

35:49.898 --> 35:54.151
Hey. Yeah. Let's go see Mommy. Come on.

35:55.403 --> 35:58.113
She's over here. Yeah.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.709
Cal.

36:11.753 --> 36:12.920
Cal.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.757
Sweetie? Look who's here.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.429
Look who's here.

36:34.776 --> 36:35.985
Seelix.

36:37.445 --> 36:41.073
I don't know how
we will manage

36:41.741 --> 36:43.659
to find a balance,
you and me.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.452
We will take care of Nick.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.998
Okay? I love you.

36:56.256 --> 36:59.967
Look. That's Mommy's hand.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.635
There.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.679
There.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.918
Hey.
Hey.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.047
How are you?

37:38.965 --> 37:39.965
Good.

37:40.967 --> 37:43.886
So, what's this?
It was here when I got in.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.679
It's from your father.

37:47.682 --> 37:51.518
Is it ticking?
He left you a note.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.737
Caprican Criminal Codes.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.035
These were my grandfather's
law books.

38:10.497 --> 38:13.958
Your dad must have had these
in storage all this time.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.544
Why is he giving them
to you now?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.925
"For that day
when we all have the time. "

38:26.638 --> 38:29.098
ROSLIN: I'm glad you stopped
by. I have something for you.

38:29.182 --> 38:32.726
This was given to me by one of
the colonists down on New Caprica.

38:32.811 --> 38:36.522
And I forgot about it and Tory
found it in a pile of old clothes.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.943
Blood Runs At Midnight.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.404
Don't let the title fool you.
It's a pretty good mystery.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.989
I think you'll like it.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.491
And it's not a loan.
It's a gift.

38:56.001 --> 38:59.169
Do you ever think about the
times much on New Caprica?

39:02.007 --> 39:05.926
I try to think about the
good times. Yes, I do.

39:06.011 --> 39:10.097
One in particular
stands out in my mind.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.268
You were wearing
a really bright red dress.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.021
Said you wanted
to build a cabin.

39:17.105 --> 39:20.149
It was Baltar's
groundbreaking ceremony.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.736
I got a little
silly that night.

39:28.491 --> 39:32.202
Do you ever wonder what would have
happened if the Cylons hadn't come back?

39:32.287 --> 39:36.540
Well, I think, given Baltar and the
terrain, we couldn't have made a go of it.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.209
What about you? Do you think you
would have stayed on Galactica,

39:39.294 --> 39:41.336
or do you think
you would have settled?

39:41.421 --> 39:44.381
It's pretty hypothetical,
isn't it?

39:45.300 --> 39:47.176
It is, until it isn't.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.305
(LAUGHING)

39:53.641 --> 39:54.725
Did I just say that?

39:54.809 --> 39:57.311
It was worth just
seeing you laugh like that.

39:57.395 --> 40:01.273
We've been at war for so long, sometimes
we forget what we're fighting for.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.817
To raise our kids in peace.

40:03.902 --> 40:08.530
Enjoy one another's company.
Live life as people again.

40:08.615 --> 40:09.865
Like that night
on New Caprica.

40:09.949 --> 40:14.620
That's really what we are
talking about here now, isn't it?

40:14.704 --> 40:17.623
That, and other times.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.294
So, if the Cylons
hadn't come back...

40:26.216 --> 40:27.716
But they did.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.146
We have certain
responsibilities.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.274
Yes, we do, sir, and...

40:45.902 --> 40:47.694
I will be back
in a few days.

40:47.779 --> 40:52.616
And if you'd like, we can
talk more about that night.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.418
Bill?

41:05.130 --> 41:06.547
The answer is yes.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.592
I absolutely would
have built the cabin.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.602
CAROLANNE: Go ahead.

41:21.312 --> 41:25.149
Put it away, like you have
after every anniversary.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.151
Promise me you won't
take it out again.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.153
ADAMA: Be easier to hate you.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.408
But that would be
a lie, Carolanne.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.954
And there's been enough
of that through our lives.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.215
We had something, didn't we?

41:51.926 --> 41:54.887
Yeah. We had something.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.734
See you next year.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.808
