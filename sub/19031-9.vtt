WEBVTT

00:03.636 --> 00:06.730
- What the hell is that?
- It's our child's crib.

00:08.108 --> 00:12.238
It looks like a trap. Are you trying
to catch someone else's baby?

00:12.278 --> 00:14.940
J.D., we don't have time for one
of your ridiculous little fantasies here.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.642
- Seriously, I'll beat you up.
- Oh, sorry.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.707
Okay, we gotta fix this tonight

00:17.751 --> 00:18.911
because tomorrow night's
birthing class,

00:18.952 --> 00:20.681
and Wednesday night
is pregnancy sex.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.551
I'm really starting
to enjoy that birthing class.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.149
All the grunting
and heavy breathing, and...

00:25.191 --> 00:27.921
- You were the only one doing that.
- I was trying to get something going.

00:29.095 --> 00:31.325
Wait, what is that walkie-talkie?
I told you to get a baby monitor.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.060
Oh, this? Better than a baby monitor.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.467
- It's long distance.
- Where's the other one?

00:37.504 --> 00:39.836
Jade Cobra. Come in, Jade Cobra.

00:41.508 --> 00:44.272
We've been compromised,
Panther Claw.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.278
What else did your baby get
that we could play with?

00:49.082 --> 00:52.916
Uh, just give him
30 cc's of medicine. Stat.

00:54.087 --> 00:57.215
It's a little hospital issue
I'm dealing with.

00:58.525 --> 01:00.049
Ben was our cadaver.

01:00.093 --> 01:02.584
I'd met him on my first day
of medical school.

01:02.629 --> 01:05.188
He was alive then. And we connected.

01:05.230 --> 01:08.359
- You look like you could use a grape.
- Thanks, Ben.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.029
So with Ben,
I was the leader of our group.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.403
Drew, isolate the tendon
of the brachialis,

01:13.440 --> 01:15.840
and, Cole, though I've
almost reconciled

01:15.875 --> 01:18.742
the fact that you are both my boyfriend

01:18.778 --> 01:22.270
and probably the human being
I respect least on earth,

01:22.315 --> 01:25.045
- you know, besides myself...
- We did it twice this morning.

01:25.885 --> 01:29.412
Nobody has ever cared about
anything you've ever said, ever.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.686
That's it,
don't even come by my room later.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.016
- Really?
- No.

01:34.194 --> 01:37.527
Attention, class. That's awesome!

01:37.564 --> 01:40.032
Can we do that again, please?
For me, please?

01:40.066 --> 01:42.626
Just, everybody, act busy. Act busy.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.666
Eyes up, don't disrespect me!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.368
Yeah, that's right.

01:48.241 --> 01:51.233
There will be a quiz next class
on the structure of the heart.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.404
Each member of your team
will have to dissect a chamber.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.674
Daddy said if I get my GPA up,
I get a Jet Ski.

01:56.983 --> 01:59.884
Me, not caring.
Thought I was clear on that.

01:59.919 --> 02:03.116
Anyway, my friend Ben will
propel our group to the top of the class.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.647
I'm so moved, I wanna put
those feelings into words.

02:05.692 --> 02:09.719
Dr. Turk, I can't wait to slice up
this old bastard's ticker.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.457
Perfect.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.696
Elliot and I had missed
our last few pregnancy sex nights.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.863
Tonight, I was ready.

02:18.905 --> 02:25.310
Loose limbs make limber lovers.
Loose limbs make limber lovers.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.607
I'm so sorry, I was stuck at work,

02:27.647 --> 02:30.013
and then on my way home,
I got a craving for Cambodian food.

02:30.049 --> 02:32.017
J.D., they have a salad that's all beef!

02:32.051 --> 02:34.611
There's not a fricking
green thing in this.

02:34.654 --> 02:38.488
But let's get this party started.
I am totally ready to get dirty with you.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.827
I don't know if you saw some
of the rose petals, but...

02:43.863 --> 02:46.058
- Mmm. This is so good.
- Over here.

02:46.966 --> 02:47.990
- And then...
- Go through here.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.626
Wait, okay.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.069
Let's just avoid the breast region.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.970
They're big, but they are not
for touching, too sore.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.407
And let's just avoid the thighs.
They sort of are like memory foam,

02:56.442 --> 03:00.105
they leave a hand print. And I have
the elbows of a 75-year-old black man.

03:00.146 --> 03:01.579
Honey, you look beautiful.

03:01.614 --> 03:04.981
I'm sorry, sweetie, I just don't
feel super-romantic right now.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.815
Do you think it's okay
if we skip tonight?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.343
Sure.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.323
This? This was all here
when I got home.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.348
I promise you, after the baby comes,

03:13.393 --> 03:15.987
things are gonna go back
to normal, okay?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.224
- Make sure you chew.
- Mmm. I'm good.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.754
I'll get your hair out of your way for you.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.232
- Want a bite, sweetie? It's so good.
- No, thank you.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.235
- I've already had diarrhea today.
- Mmm.

03:23.269 --> 03:25.203
- Well, I've not pooped in a week.
- Ah!

03:25.405 --> 03:28.272
So, yes, J.D. And I are not
having sex right now, but it's fine.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.538
I put it right into my schedule
for after the baby's born.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.169
What is that, a sex Trapper Keeper?

03:32.212 --> 03:35.010
Oh, I wish. No, it's my post-pregnancy
action plan. See?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.948
By week three,
I'll have lost all the baby weight.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.281
Weeks four and five I'll be deep
into my post-partum depression,

03:39.319 --> 03:42.345
where I'll spend most of my time crying
and then regaining the baby weight.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.582
And then something
will snap me out of it,

03:43.623 --> 03:46.387
probably a sunrise or a hilarious e-card,

03:46.426 --> 03:49.793
and then by week six,
we are back to nasty town.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.155
- Let's walk in silence, maybe.
- Yes.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.468
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Foster.
How are you feeling?

03:56.502 --> 03:58.663
Oh, he won't stop complaining.

03:58.705 --> 04:02.368
- I've got lymphoma.
- Well, I've got multiple myeloma.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.707
You two, come on, now.
Nobody wins at cancer.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.111
That's like double what you got.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.782
I like to start every day
with an exercise in futility,

04:13.820 --> 04:17.278
and to that end, Johnny Legacy,
ulcerative colitis...

04:17.322 --> 04:18.551
Perry!

04:20.226 --> 04:22.490
It's behind me, isn't it?

04:23.263 --> 04:26.630
With every couple, there's
the hard-ass and then the sweet one.

04:26.666 --> 04:31.467
Come here. I can't deal with this year's
clump of ugly nerds eyeballing me.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.703
Hot biscuits, Cox is the sweet one?

04:35.742 --> 04:38.176
You know that bag of bones
my sister Danni married?

04:38.211 --> 04:41.339
- He died. She got nothing.
- Burt died?

04:41.381 --> 04:44.043
You're not listening. Danni got nothing.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.280
You need to do your will
so I can get all your stuff. Chop-chop.

04:47.687 --> 04:51.783
Ma'am, if you need any help
through this difficult time, I'm here.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.924
- You're that Aaronson kid.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.452
I remember your mom
when she was wearing tube tops,

04:57.497 --> 05:00.557
giving it away to any guy
that would buy her a free steak.

05:00.600 --> 05:05.003
- She's so classy.
- Oh, dear God, I love you.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.196
I love you.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.430
So, let me get this straight.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.998
You and Elliot aren't having sex
till after the baby's born?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.067
Yes.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.408
But who are you gonna
have sex with, then?

05:13.446 --> 05:16.244
Oh. She's gonna watch
while you do other chicks.

05:16.282 --> 05:19.581
No, no, Todd, neither one of us
is going to be having sex.

05:21.287 --> 05:24.620
- L-gotta-take-a-walk-five.
- He's not taking it well.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.457
All the baby books say we'll be back to
our normal sex life in about six weeks.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.985
J.D., those baby books
are filled with lies.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.563
You don't know. It's crazy.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.260
You're gonna be changing diapers
covered in spit-up.

05:35.301 --> 05:38.031
All right? You're not gonna have sex
for a long, long, long, long time.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.504
- No "Hide the Penny"?
- No.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.336
- No "Me Girl, You Boy"?
- No.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.569
- No "Dirty Zulu Warrior"?
- No.

05:43.609 --> 05:44.803
And that one's racist.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.244
Well, I'm sure there'll
still be cuddling, right?

05:47.280 --> 05:50.909
Turk, I'm a man, I have needs.
Please say there'll be cuddling.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.818
- She'll have the baby to cuddle with.
- That little bastard.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:10.269 --> 06:11.793
Turk freaked me out
about what would happen

06:11.838 --> 06:13.601
with Elliot after the baby came,

06:13.639 --> 06:15.129
so I turned to my mentor.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.471
Dorian, I do not need to hear

06:16.509 --> 06:19.672
the pathetic slap-and-tickle
of your soon-to-be-vanished sex life.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.612
I just feel like I'm racing
against the clock,

06:21.647 --> 06:25.777
like Harrison Ford
in some kind of Harrison Ford movie.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.812
Talking pregnancy sex?

06:28.855 --> 06:32.052
Yep. Nothing like a girl
with a little junk in the front.

06:32.091 --> 06:33.922
What are you,
some kind of pervy ninja?

06:33.960 --> 06:37.123
Oh, thanks, man. Appreesh.
Hey, you know what you should do?

06:37.163 --> 06:40.132
- Take your shorty on a babymoon.
- What's a babymoon?

06:40.166 --> 06:43.329
It's like a romantic trip couples take
before their baby's born.

06:43.369 --> 06:44.927
That's not what I pictured.

06:46.372 --> 06:47.771
Breast-milk mojitos.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.205
You've had a few too many.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.936
Those babies are way too close
to the water.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.811
You know,
I haven't bagged a preggers yet,

06:55.848 --> 06:58.373
but I bet it's like having sex
with a waterbed.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.149
The baby bump actually has
the tension of an exercise ball.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.156
I was a doula in Madrid for two years.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.988
Oh, Drew, so cool.
Been to Europe.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.392
Hey, just babymoon it, dude.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.920
All right, but don't play any jazz
while you're having sex

07:11.964 --> 07:14.990
'cause I read on the Web
that it will make the baby gay.

07:15.034 --> 07:18.003
Jazz makes babies gay,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.632
Jazz makes babies gay! Future doctor!

07:23.576 --> 07:25.134
You know, Drew,

07:25.311 --> 07:27.745
- we haven't really connected yet.
- No.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.477
Is that because by sleeping with Cole
I've invalidated myself as a person?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.007
- Pretty much.
- I get that.

07:33.052 --> 07:34.576
So, you ready for the big
heart dissection tomorrow?

07:34.620 --> 07:35.644
Totally.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.851
Plus, my dad sent a care package
of smoked meats from home,

07:38.891 --> 07:40.483
so I thought afterwards,

07:40.526 --> 07:43.586
maybe you, me, and Cole could go
to the park and have a sausage picnic.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.721
Mmm.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.732
- Okay, that sounded weird.
- You know what else is weird,

07:46.766 --> 07:50.031
is that you've been supervising
our group so much lately,

07:50.069 --> 07:51.536
and you're doing it well, really.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.563
- Yeah. Drew, I'm with someone.
- Not where I was going.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.404
I was just gonna say that
you haven't done

07:56.442 --> 07:58.171
any cutting of our cadaver yet. Hmm.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.145
I know, I'm psyched to get in there.

08:00.179 --> 08:04.411
Hells, yeah. My woman's gonna go all
Edward Scissorhands on his ass.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.915
I'm making a hedge.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.683
Is he, like, really good in bed
or something?

08:10.723 --> 08:14.124
- He'd have to be, right?
- I'd hope so, for your sake.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.924
Hello.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.766
My wife is making me do a will,

08:24.804 --> 08:27.170
so I'm going to need one of you
to act as my confidant,

08:27.206 --> 08:29.834
that I can talk at but not listen to.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.541
Well played, Mr. Suffin.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.739
Dr. Mahoney, it looks like
you're going to be my sounding board.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.337
- Congratulations.
- Have fun.

08:36.381 --> 08:37.610
You're dead to me.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.708
So, Jordan is after my stuff,

08:39.751 --> 08:43.984
but there is no way that succubus
is gonna get my recliner after I die.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.856
It is the one chair I sit in
when I watch TV

08:46.893 --> 08:49.794
and yell at sports figures
and reality stars.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.626
Fine. Right before you kick it,

08:51.664 --> 08:53.529
stick a dead bird
underneath the cushion.

08:53.566 --> 08:54.931
That'll get ripe real fast.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.197
Then you can sit back
and watch the whole show from hell.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.830
Mahoney, you are a promising young
doctor, you are.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.181
I'm so sorry, Mr. Foster.
We did everything we could.

09:12.151 --> 09:15.609
- Can I have a moment to say goodbye?
- Of course.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.187
They were married 47 years.

09:23.963 --> 09:26.989
Jordan and I have been together
for almost 30.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.397
Yeah, but life expectancy
for people your age is excellent.

09:31.437 --> 09:34.031
You know, unless you're
a type-A workaholic in a high-stress job

09:34.073 --> 09:37.099
- with, like, a lot of built-up anger.
- Enough.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.671
You're not crying, are you?

09:40.346 --> 09:42.439
I was joking at first,

09:42.481 --> 09:45.678
but I'm just having
a pregnancy moment here. I just...

09:45.718 --> 09:48.846
I'm just really gonna miss you
when you're gone.

09:52.391 --> 09:55.383
I snuck into the lab to get ready
for tomorrow's exam.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.760
Med students are told to keep
a cadaver's face covered

09:57.797 --> 10:01.324
so it doesn't feel too personal,
but Ben didn't like it.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.998
Oh, it's stuffy under there.

10:06.038 --> 10:10.065
- Sorry about that. How you doing?
- Not too shabby.

10:10.109 --> 10:15.172
You know, I haven't cut you at all yet,
but I'm gonna get in there tomorrow.

10:15.214 --> 10:19.048
Lucy, we're friends.
It would be an honor.

10:19.885 --> 10:22.217
Oh, Ben, that's so sweet.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.953
What are you doing here?
Were you talking to your cadaver?

10:27.994 --> 10:31.896
Uh, yeah. I thought I heard
that you were supposed to talk to it.

10:31.931 --> 10:35.423
Like a plant, so that it'll,
you know, grow.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.760
- What are you doing here?
- Oh.

10:39.405 --> 10:43.205
I saw the light on 'cause, you know,
I was over in my office working.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.335
'Cause I work at night, you know.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.777
I counted to 50.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.712
Ready or not, here I come.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.680
You didn't see me, all right?
I wasn't here.

10:53.352 --> 10:56.082
- You'll do great tomorrow.
- Thanks, Ben.

10:57.456 --> 10:59.151
Hello, wife-face.

10:59.191 --> 11:02.354
Your shift is over
and I'm taking you on a babymoon.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.920
What?
What are you talking about?

11:05.598 --> 11:08.726
A babymoon is a vacation
you and your loved one take

11:08.768 --> 11:11.259
right before your baby comes
out of your special area.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.930
And the resort I found is amazing.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.873
They have horseback riding
and jet-skiing.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.877
Is there also a punching-each-other-
in-the-stomach contest?

11:18.911 --> 11:20.606
'Cause that's another thing
that I can't do.

11:20.646 --> 11:23.080
Well, we could have hotel sex.
You like that.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.549
We could do girl hair with our towels.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.552
We can turn the temperature all
the way down to 50

11:27.586 --> 11:29.349
and then crank it back up to 80.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.322
We'll be like gods
controlling the weather.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.689
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, let's go.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.728
Sometimes something small can
represent something much bigger.

11:40.299 --> 11:43.666
Whether it's a pen
that represents your mortality...

11:44.236 --> 11:50.436
Jordan, I can't sign a will right now.
As usual, please don't call me back.

11:52.611 --> 11:56.069
A suitcase that mocks
your one last gasp of coupledom...

11:56.115 --> 11:58.208
Wait, what are we doing?
J.D., this is ridiculous.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.343
We can't go on a babymoon right now.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.911
There's nine thousand things
to do before the baby comes.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.388
We don't have time for this.

12:04.423 --> 12:08.860
Or a tiny exam that's
a whopping 25% of your final grade.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.294
All right, Lucy Bennett, you're up.

12:11.330 --> 12:13.423
Let's see if you can bring it home
for the team.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.833
Time to shine. Here I come, Ben.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.862
Please don't cut me. It's not right.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.972
I'm sorry, Dr. Turk, I can't do this.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.776
We have to do the babymoon.

12:33.819 --> 12:36.549
Turk said that once the kid's born,
our lives are gonna change forever.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.183
Yeah, Turk also said that Knight Rider
was a documentary.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.819
It's based on fact, Elliot.
Everybody knows that.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.852
Plus, once the kid's born,
you're gonna be obsessed.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.022
You probably already picked out

12:45.064 --> 12:46.691
what she's gonna wear
on her first day of school.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.666
So? That decision brands you forever.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.601
I still have night terrors
about my first day of high school.

12:50.636 --> 12:54.697
I wore this suede fringe outfit because
of that movie Can't Buy Me Love.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.731
Oh, J.D., it's the most amazing film.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.540
Fade in, Patrick Dempsey,
a fresh-faced nerd...

12:59.578 --> 13:02.046
Elliot, do you think there's a
Patrick Dempsey movie I haven't seen?

13:02.081 --> 13:03.639
J.D., I know that some couples

13:03.682 --> 13:05.445
don't make time for each other
as new parents,

13:05.484 --> 13:08.146
but we're not gonna be like that.
We're different.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.347
Are you sure?

13:09.388 --> 13:11.253
Because we also said
we were gonna be different

13:11.290 --> 13:14.020
and not fight the first year of marriage.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.119
You did the laundry and you put my
work socks beside my gym socks,

13:17.163 --> 13:18.221
and they were touching in the drawer.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.663
I mean, that's disgusting.
I had to throw them out.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.996
Okay, I don't have time for this.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.066
Lucy, you screwed us.
We're being graded as a team.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.834
Ben's not just a grade to me.
He's a person.

13:27.873 --> 13:31.468
Hey, this is bigger than you or him.
This is about a Jet Ski, yo.

13:31.510 --> 13:34.946
Cole, silence or punching.
You know our deal.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.039
This is Ben's heart we're talking about.

13:37.082 --> 13:40.347
It's where he stores
his feelings and memories.

13:40.386 --> 13:44.117
Ladies and gentlemen, apparently,
the heart stores memories.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.714
Future doctors!

13:48.460 --> 13:50.519
Lucy, you have got to cut.

13:51.063 --> 13:53.896
The Jet Ski is the motorcycle
of the sea!

13:55.267 --> 13:56.791
Pain is how we learn.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.870
Hey, guys.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.737
I want you to meet me in the O.R.
In an hour.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.737
Do I still have to hang out with you
as your confidant,

14:04.777 --> 14:06.267
even though there's not
a chance in hell

14:06.312 --> 14:08.337
you're gonna listen to anything I say?

14:08.380 --> 14:09.506
Yes.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.948
You know, just because one of those
old married people croaked

14:11.984 --> 14:13.952
doesn't mean you
or Jordan are gonna die.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.614
I shouldn't have brought the will
to the hospital. It was a rookie mistake.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.555
I mean, around here,
you just can't let your work

14:18.591 --> 14:20.388
and your personal life overlap.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.156
Yeah. That was always
Ally McBeal's problem, too.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.722
It's so hard being a working woman
in the mid-'90s.

14:26.765 --> 14:31.532
That's it. You're out as confidant.
I'd rather have Dorian, for God's sake.

14:31.570 --> 14:37.475
- Fine. I'm gonna tell him you said that.
- No! No! No!

14:41.747 --> 14:44.147
I'm so glad you chose me
to confide in, Perry.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.377
Denise caught me up to speed.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.408
By the by,
I've got some lady problems, too.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.149
You do realize that by saying
something like that to me,

14:50.189 --> 14:52.521
you're just continuing
the never-ending cycle of abuse.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.582
I don't do it on purpose.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.526
I do. I love the attention.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.119
So, I explained to Elliot

14:57.162 --> 14:59.630
that we have to make more time
for each other before the baby comes,

14:59.665 --> 15:02.998
- and she won't listen to me.
- Dorian, you're a fool.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.069
Why do you have
to be that way, Perry?

15:05.104 --> 15:06.935
More, please.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.634
A wife cannot hear logic
from her husband.

15:09.675 --> 15:13.076
It must come from someone else,
a friend, a stranger, Oprah.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.410
If Barbie will not listen
to what's good for her,

15:15.447 --> 15:17.938
then you just gotta make it happen.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.383
You're good.
I love confiding with you, Perry.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.511
Let's do more later.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.018
Call you.

15:25.491 --> 15:28.085
Wow, somebody is really dehydrated.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.595
Let me tell you about my friend, Jake.

15:33.632 --> 15:37.932
Jake and I have played in a weekly
basketball game for about seven years.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.165
Our kids go
to the same school together.

15:40.205 --> 15:44.869
He's really important to me.
And this is him, right here.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.439
Your minds are blown

15:49.481 --> 15:52.450
So, why are we going to be looking
into your friend's guts?

15:52.484 --> 15:53.781
For Lucy.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.949
Look, I know Ben's real to you.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.482
But your patients are always
gonna be real.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.789
And the truth is,
there are gonna be many a times

16:01.827 --> 16:04.295
where you're gonna have to hurt them
in order to help them.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.855
Like I'm doing with my friend here.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.264
I'll let you re-take the test again tonight.

16:10.436 --> 16:13.234
- You ready?
- Do blue crabs whistle?

16:14.273 --> 16:16.707
They do when you boil them alive.

16:17.409 --> 16:20.037
Yes, Dr. Turk. I won't let you down.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.070
- I'm gonna go study now.
- Okay.

16:22.181 --> 16:26.117
- So this guy's a friend of yours, huh?
- No, I've never met him.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.847
This is just some dude
with appendicitis.

16:28.887 --> 16:32.084
And he blows your mind again

16:33.158 --> 16:35.217
Ooh, again

16:35.260 --> 16:36.522
Scalpel.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.431
How are you doing, Mr. Foster?
I'm so sorry about Penny.

16:44.803 --> 16:49.831
You know, you always think you're
gonna have just a little more time.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.706
Yeah, I guess you do.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.977
You know, he's right about
the whole running-out-of-time thing.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.955
I guess.
But having a baby's not like dying.

17:05.624 --> 17:08.457
It's... It's exactly like dying.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.519
We have Sam on the weekends,
we know how to handle it.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.156
Yeah, but step-kids aren't the same.
They're a rental.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.722
You gotta take mildly good care
of them,

17:14.767 --> 17:18.224
return them with a full tank of gas
and not too many dents.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.737
I'll tell you what, there, Barbie,

17:19.771 --> 17:21.137
I'm gonna go ahead and give you
my own version

17:21.173 --> 17:22.503
of something your husband told you,

17:22.540 --> 17:24.974
but you couldn't hear
because you're married to him.

17:25.010 --> 17:29.174
After that baby comes,
nothing goes back to normal.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.518
Time doesn't slow down.
It only gets faster.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.648
And then 20 years later
you find yourself signing a will

17:36.688 --> 17:39.589
and realizing that you didn't
spend nearly enough time

17:39.625 --> 17:42.025
with the one person
you care most about.

17:42.861 --> 17:46.456
- God, I wish J.D. Had said that.
- Ah, don't blame yourself.

17:46.498 --> 17:50.093
I can't understand him, either.
Sounds like a bag of cats.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.902
J.D., I got your page.
Look, before you say anything,

17:56.942 --> 17:59.467
I wanted to tell you I was wrong.
I'm sorry.

17:59.511 --> 18:02.002
Look, you know this is what I do
before big, life-changing events.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.982
I get way inside my own head
and freak out.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.450
Like, three weeks before
med school started,

18:06.485 --> 18:09.477
I got way into shoplifting
and watching anime pornography.

18:09.521 --> 18:12.718
I mean, I'm talking
some weird-ass cartoons, man.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.250
Anyway, I love you,

18:15.294 --> 18:17.888
and I'm sorry
that I wasn't able to hear you

18:17.930 --> 18:20.524
and I didn't mean to ruin the babymoon.

18:20.566 --> 18:21.999
You didn't.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.764
Panther Claw, the Walrus has landed.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.237
Roger that. We're set for go.

18:30.576 --> 18:33.670
Oh, my God, J.D.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.374
I figured if you couldn't
go to the babymoon,

18:36.415 --> 18:38.679
I'd bring the babymoon to you.

18:38.717 --> 18:42.448
- You did all this by yourself?
- Well, I had a little help.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.456
Denise brought some
non-alcoholic beer.

18:45.591 --> 18:48.492
Yeah, I got it for this dude I'm railing.
He used to be an alkie.

18:48.527 --> 18:52.224
Probably not an appropriate time
to bring all that up, but there it is.

18:52.264 --> 18:53.629
Thank you.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.633
And I brought some
sensual body chocolate.

18:56.668 --> 18:57.760
Oh.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.737
What's the situation
with those big old "D's"?

18:59.771 --> 19:00.999
Got any milk yet?

19:01.039 --> 19:03.803
- He should go.
- Get the hell out of here.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.477
- Shall we?
- We shall.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.973
We all have points in life
when things get painfully real.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.246
- You ready?
- Yep.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.149
Ben, I haven't even touched you yet.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.185
You're doing a great job.

19:24.496 --> 19:28.091
When thinking about the end
makes you re-evaluate the now.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.401
There, I just signed your ridiculous will.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.894
But before I give it to you,
I'd like you to make me a promise

19:34.940 --> 19:38.637
that just you and I can go away
this weekend. No kids.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.770
The no-kids thing
is not really a big deal

19:40.812 --> 19:43.178
'cause I don't see them
that much, anyway.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.844
But it would be really nice
to get away from the nannies.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.182
- Your will.
- Thank you.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.381
I'd like to propose a toast.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.012
To our deaths,

19:52.057 --> 19:55.857
may they be untimely and inconvenient
for all our loved ones.

19:56.395 --> 19:59.887
- So sweet.
- I love you.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.298
I guess you're just lucky
if you have someone

20:04.336 --> 20:06.998
who'll go along for the ride with you.

20:07.706 --> 20:12.143
- I can't believe we're having a baby.
- I know. It's pretty amazing, huh?

20:12.744 --> 20:17.340
This is pretty awesome, though, right?
I mean, this is as good as hotel sex.

20:18.016 --> 20:21.543
You know,
there is a HoJo's down the street.

20:21.587 --> 20:26.650
Thin walls, scratchy towels,
sketchy types out front.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.990
- What do you say?
- Motel sex?

20:29.728 --> 20:30.956
Ooh.

20:30.996 --> 20:34.955
It'll be like I'm a senator
and you're a tobacco lobbyist.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.092
We should arrive separately.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.531
Or you're a bored housewife,

20:38.570 --> 20:42.165
and I'm a strapping drifter looking
for a warm meal and some comfort.

20:42.207 --> 20:44.266
J.D., come here.

20:53.719 --> 20:57.746
All my cutting problems over,
no more talking cadavers for me.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.155
There's nothing to be scared of.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.991
Dr. D, what are you doing here?

21:05.030 --> 21:07.521
I'm playing hide-and-seek with Turk!
Don't tell him I'm here.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.591
Close me up! Close me up!

21:12.170 --> 21:16.834
Hey, if J.D. Sees me, I wasn't here.
Close me up! Close me up!

21:24.549 --> 21:27.416
He's never going to find me.
