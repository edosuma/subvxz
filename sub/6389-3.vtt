WEBVTT

00:07.339 --> 00:09.374
Previously on Californication...

00:10.409 --> 00:11.376
- Nothing?
- Uh-uh.

00:11.410 --> 00:13.812
Nope. Not a twitch.

00:13.846 --> 00:16.381
I even tossed his salad
for a second or three.

00:16.415 --> 00:18.149
Are you sure you can
actually handle the job?

00:18.184 --> 00:20.885
Can you show up on time,
play nice with others?

00:20.920 --> 00:23.221
Can you work with actors without
fucking them or punching them?

00:23.255 --> 00:25.156
Oh, so you have read my work?

00:25.191 --> 00:27.592
What? What? What is it now?

00:27.626 --> 00:29.494
I mean, nothing would
surprise me at this point.

00:29.528 --> 00:31.129
He's really my kid?

00:31.163 --> 00:34.065
I mean, I... all I have is
his word to go on, and...

00:34.099 --> 00:35.733
and no offense, but he doesn't present

00:35.768 --> 00:37.569
as the most trustworthy source.

00:37.603 --> 00:39.237
I'm standing right here.

00:39.271 --> 00:41.139
He's got all these crazy expectations

00:41.173 --> 00:42.974
of you guys making up for lost time.

00:43.008 --> 00:44.342
I don't have the heart to tell him

00:44.376 --> 00:45.810
that you're not that kind of guy.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.278
Wha... Oh, is this your kid?

00:47.313 --> 00:49.314
- Apparently.
- Does he want a job?

00:49.348 --> 00:52.016
Because I just promoted the
PA to writer's assistant.

00:52.051 --> 00:55.520
Baby, there's someone you got to meet.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.529
- How can I make this better?
- You can't.

01:04.563 --> 01:07.832
Well, that's a very
defeatist attitude, Karen.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.767
Hank...

01:09.802 --> 01:11.669
you have another family.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.504
"Family" is a strong word.

01:13.539 --> 01:17.342
However dysfunctional,
we've always been a family.

01:17.376 --> 01:19.611
Now there's another one.

01:19.645 --> 01:22.513
There's another baby
mama. There's another kid.

01:22.548 --> 01:26.050
Do you realize how fucking
devastating that is?

01:26.085 --> 01:27.952
Do you realize that the bottom

01:27.987 --> 01:31.155
has just officially dropped
out of our relationship?

01:31.190 --> 01:33.024
Okay, okay, okay. I-I get it. I get it.

01:33.058 --> 01:34.392
But I think once you get over

01:34.426 --> 01:36.294
that first initial jolt of anger,

01:36.328 --> 01:37.829
you're gonna see that... that...

01:37.863 --> 01:39.831
Angry? I'm not angry.

01:39.865 --> 01:42.333
- No? You're not?
- No! Why would I be angry?

01:42.368 --> 01:44.502
- I don't know. You seem kind of angry.
- No. No, no, no.

01:44.536 --> 01:46.537
I'm not even entitled to anger,

01:46.572 --> 01:50.408
because... because you impregnated
her before you even met me.

01:50.442 --> 01:52.176
- That's true. That's very true.
- Yeah.

01:52.211 --> 01:53.645
And I'm actu... I'm glad
that you see it that way.

01:53.679 --> 01:55.046
- No!
- And I think you're actually being

01:55.080 --> 01:56.581
hugely progressive about the whole thing.

01:56.615 --> 01:58.650
And that's what makes it ten times worse.

01:58.684 --> 02:01.552
She was there first.

02:01.587 --> 02:04.322
She is baby mama number one.

02:04.356 --> 02:06.724
I am baby mama number two.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.192
Okay.

02:08.227 --> 02:10.728
And she's a ridiculous fucking milf,

02:10.763 --> 02:12.864
which makes it even "Worser."

02:12.898 --> 02:14.999
I-I know that I have a
knack for this shit, Karen.

02:15.034 --> 02:17.201
Oh, you have a knack, all right.

02:17.236 --> 02:19.270
It's a minor miracle

02:19.305 --> 02:21.039
that more kids didn't come looking for you.

02:21.073 --> 02:23.207
Oh, hey, that's not very nice.

02:23.242 --> 02:24.943
You know I've always been very responsible

02:24.977 --> 02:26.678
when it comes to the controlling of birth.

02:26.712 --> 02:28.413
And in the past, if a woman was kind enough

02:28.447 --> 02:30.181
to share her privates with me and asked me

02:30.215 --> 02:33.084
to slap on a prophylactic,
I would do that with a smile.

02:33.118 --> 02:34.919
You know, but sometimes the dogwater

02:34.954 --> 02:36.521
can seep in there and cause trouble.

02:36.555 --> 02:37.789
Oh, yeah, I know the trouble.

02:37.823 --> 02:39.424
I know the trouble.

02:39.458 --> 02:41.025
Do you know what you need
to start thinking about?

02:41.060 --> 02:42.427
Hmm?

02:42.461 --> 02:44.062
Is how you are gonna tell your daughter

02:44.096 --> 02:46.030
that she has a brother that
she never even knew about!

02:46.065 --> 02:48.232
It's a half-brother, Karen. Half.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.134
It's like having a long-lost cousin.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.536
It's not that big a deal, really.

02:51.570 --> 02:52.937
- It's nothing like that!
- Okay.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.106
I got to go to work anyway.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.474
So, um...

02:56.508 --> 02:59.444
It was good talking to you!

02:59.478 --> 03:01.379
Have a nice day!

03:54.833 --> 03:56.267
What the fuck, dude?

03:56.301 --> 03:58.036
What happened to meeting
me out on the curb?

03:58.070 --> 04:00.338
Sorry. I guess I overslept. I
was up all night playing Xbox.

04:00.372 --> 04:02.173
Why? Why would you do that

04:02.207 --> 04:03.841
when you know you're starting
a new job in the morning?

04:03.876 --> 04:05.543
'Cause that's how I deal with my anxiety...

04:05.577 --> 04:07.478
Xbox... and weed. Do you smoke weed?

04:07.513 --> 04:09.280
God, there's so much
I don't know about you.

04:09.314 --> 04:12.650
Anyway, I-I'm pretty
nervous about this new gig.

04:12.684 --> 04:15.053
Yeah, well, now you're gonna
be pretty late for this new gig.

04:15.087 --> 04:16.353
I guess I thought show business

04:16.387 --> 04:17.488
started later than the real world.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.057
It does. It's 11:00 AM.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.725
Is that late enough for you?

04:20.759 --> 04:22.560
Shit. O-o-okay, I-I'm
gonna go get dressed.

04:22.594 --> 04:23.795
- I'm sorry.
- It's a good plan.

04:23.829 --> 04:25.730
Now hustle! Come on, move it!

04:25.764 --> 04:28.332
- Okay!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

04:28.367 --> 04:29.867
You know what? I-I don't know if I'm okay

04:29.902 --> 04:31.069
with you coming down on me so hard.

04:31.103 --> 04:32.503
What gives you the right, huh?

04:32.538 --> 04:34.238
Where have you been
the last 20 years or so?

04:34.273 --> 04:37.075
Oh, I don't know, I've been
busy not knowing about you.

04:37.109 --> 04:38.309
Still.

04:38.343 --> 04:39.811
You mind if I use the facilities?

04:39.845 --> 04:42.146
I don't care.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.215
"I don't care."

04:46.385 --> 04:47.585
- Hank, what the fuck?
- Ay! Apologies.

04:47.619 --> 04:49.353
- Jesus!
- No need to take names in vain.

04:49.388 --> 04:51.055
We're all adults here,

04:51.090 --> 04:53.091
and we happen to be adults
who have seen each other naked.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.159
- 20 years ago.
- Hey, I remember that mole.

04:55.194 --> 04:56.928
Could we not have this
conversation while I'm peeing?

04:56.962 --> 04:58.863
Do we have to?

04:58.897 --> 05:00.665
Okay, I'm just kidding
and backing away slowly...

05:00.699 --> 05:04.035
- Very, very slowly.
- Get out!

05:06.305 --> 05:08.873
Yeah, could you maybe not
hit on my mom in front of me?

05:08.907 --> 05:10.241
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

05:10.275 --> 05:11.709
I wasn't hitting on her.

05:11.743 --> 05:13.277
I was engaging a little flirtatious banter.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.545
There's a big difference.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.114
Whatever, okay? I have issues.

05:16.148 --> 05:17.415
The only kids who ever
wanted to hang out with me

05:17.449 --> 05:18.916
wanted to fuck my mom.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.451
They'd be asking for hugs all the time,

05:20.486 --> 05:21.686
knuckle-brushing her ass.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.920
Fucking confusing times, man.

05:26.425 --> 05:29.193
- What?
- Nothing.

05:29.228 --> 05:31.028
Do I look pimp?

05:31.063 --> 05:33.297
You're pimp.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.733
- Mom, come on, cut it out.
- Okay.

05:35.767 --> 05:37.301
Okay, be nice, work hard,

05:37.336 --> 05:39.036
mind your manners, and
don't be weird, okay?

05:39.071 --> 05:40.404
- I won't.
- Promise?

05:40.439 --> 05:41.706
- Promise.
- I love you.

05:41.740 --> 05:42.940
I love you too.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.776
- Where's my hug?
- Asshole.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.448
Can you wait in the car for a minute?

05:50.482 --> 05:52.049
No funny stuff.

05:52.084 --> 05:54.986
You look cute.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.487
- Hmm.
- How's Karen?

05:56.522 --> 05:58.122
Oh, she's been busy

05:58.157 --> 06:00.658
hating on me and whatnot,
making voodoo dolls.

06:00.692 --> 06:02.560
Oh! There she goes again.

06:02.594 --> 06:05.830
Ahh, and in the back
too. She's getting busy.

06:05.864 --> 06:08.499
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- Uh, that's not a good idea.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.068
You're already a little
too milf-y for her taste.

06:11.103 --> 06:12.403
Really? Why would you say that?

06:12.437 --> 06:14.005
Because that's what she said.

06:14.039 --> 06:16.274
Wow, that is so nice of her.

06:16.308 --> 06:18.109
She is so beautiful.

06:18.143 --> 06:21.579
Yeah, me and my beautiful
baby mamas... lucky me.

06:21.613 --> 06:23.314
Keep an eye on him, okay?

06:23.348 --> 06:25.483
Because he can get a little
weird in social situations.

06:25.517 --> 06:27.852
Really? I hadn't noticed that.

06:27.886 --> 06:29.420
What do you mean "Weird"?

06:29.454 --> 06:33.257
He's not gonna yank out his dick, is he?

06:33.292 --> 06:36.694
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

06:36.728 --> 06:38.529
Look, maybe he went through a phase

06:38.564 --> 06:40.097
where he liked to expose himself to girls.

06:40.132 --> 06:41.832
- "Maybe"?
- And if he did,

06:41.867 --> 06:43.367
it was totally normal and a
developmentally appropriate way

06:43.402 --> 06:44.802
for him to express his sexuality.

06:44.836 --> 06:47.104
- Well...
- And it was a long time ago.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.706
We got through it.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.708
Hmm.

07:00.319 --> 07:04.622
All right, kids, let's make
some fucking television.

07:04.656 --> 07:06.958
Yes.

07:06.992 --> 07:09.527
Hugh, my boy, you're up.
You're writing episode three.

07:09.561 --> 07:11.829
Awesome! Appreciate the
vote of confidence, boss.

07:11.863 --> 07:14.131
Yeah, yeah. Let's hear it.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.034
Okay, okay, okay.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.403
Fade in... we open on
the Santa Monica strand.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.472
Camera finds Danko Jones.

07:21.506 --> 07:23.007
He's rollerblading down the street.

07:23.041 --> 07:25.243
Rollerblad... why the
fuck is he rollerblading?

07:25.277 --> 07:27.645
Why is the incredibly
cool, aggressively male

07:27.679 --> 07:28.980
star of our show rollerblading?

07:29.014 --> 07:30.548
Because he wants to meet women.

07:30.582 --> 07:31.916
Works like a charm. Trust.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.484
Anyway, stay with me.

07:33.518 --> 07:35.586
Danko meets this beautiful
girl on the strand.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.988
She is bangin'.

07:37.022 --> 07:39.824
Think Rihanna meets...

07:39.858 --> 07:41.425
someone even hotter than Rihanna.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.562
Danko takes her home and
bangs the shit out of her,

07:44.596 --> 07:46.197
'cause that's just the
kind of guy our Danko is.

07:46.231 --> 07:47.565
Yeah.

07:47.599 --> 07:50.001
Next morning, he wakes up, she's gone.

07:50.035 --> 07:52.336
He heads off to work. Guess
who the new captain is.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.905
Roller girl. Boom!

07:54.940 --> 07:57.074
Deal with that, Danko.

08:00.045 --> 08:02.113
Hank, you're writing episode three.

08:02.147 --> 08:03.681
I'll write it.

08:03.715 --> 08:05.283
Hank, you're writing episode three.

08:05.317 --> 08:08.686
I do have 15 years of
procedural experience...

08:08.720 --> 08:11.889
versus the rapist, who has none.

08:11.923 --> 08:13.824
- Hank, episode three.
- Groovy.

08:13.859 --> 08:16.027
- What do you got?
- What do you mean?

08:16.061 --> 08:18.362
Story ideas... let's go.

08:18.397 --> 08:22.833
Oh, I-I'm not a-a big
fan of outlining, per se.

08:22.868 --> 08:25.336
I like to do a fair amount
of exploring on the page.

08:25.370 --> 08:26.737
Well, that's good to know.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.339
Save it for your novel, all right?

08:28.373 --> 08:30.508
Writing a good episode of television

08:30.542 --> 08:32.275
means knowing every
single little fucking thing

08:32.311 --> 08:33.878
before you put pen to paper.

08:33.912 --> 08:36.347
This way, the work is
done before you even begin.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.049
Well, what about a bad
episode of television?

08:38.082 --> 08:40.418
Same thing.

08:40.452 --> 08:42.385
Come on, man, pitch me something!

08:42.421 --> 08:43.554
This isn't a fucking internship.

08:43.587 --> 08:46.957
Okay, all right. Okay.

08:46.992 --> 08:50.428
Um...

08:50.462 --> 08:52.797
There's a... there's a... there's...

08:52.831 --> 08:55.866
there's a serial rapist
run amok in Santa Monica.

08:55.901 --> 08:57.635
- Good.
- Here we go.

08:57.669 --> 08:59.937
Don't worry. I'll make sure
he gets his comeuppance.

08:59.971 --> 09:03.374
And... and he's targeting hot
female rollerbladers, right?

09:03.408 --> 09:05.710
And... and Danko Jones, against his will,

09:05.744 --> 09:08.045
has to lace up and... and hit the strand.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.380
Good. I like it.

09:09.414 --> 09:10.548
This is fun. This is funny.

09:10.582 --> 09:12.216
It's a fish out of water.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.751
You got the cool black guy

09:13.785 --> 09:15.586
doing the stupid white-guy thing.

09:15.620 --> 09:17.254
This is how we tell stories.

09:17.289 --> 09:19.223
Riff on it a little bit.

09:19.257 --> 09:20.758
What do you got for a "B" story?

09:20.792 --> 09:23.260
Uh...

09:23.295 --> 09:24.729
Yeah...

09:24.763 --> 09:26.397
What if this doesn't need a "B" story?

09:26.431 --> 09:28.632
What if this is just a very special episode

09:28.667 --> 09:30.267
of primetime... Oh, hey, lunch.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.269
- Oh, my God.
- Ah!

09:32.304 --> 09:33.838
What took you so long?

09:33.872 --> 09:36.607
Kid, you got to pretend
like I'm hypoglycemic.

09:36.641 --> 09:37.641
Mmm!

09:43.615 --> 09:47.184
What part of "Chopped and tossed,

09:47.219 --> 09:49.520
extra dressing on the side, no onions"

09:49.554 --> 09:51.689
don't you understand?

09:51.723 --> 09:54.492
Chopped and tossed! Extra
dressing on the side!

09:54.526 --> 09:56.494
No onions!

09:56.528 --> 09:58.896
Motherfucker!

09:58.930 --> 10:01.399
Way to go, Levon.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.401
You should go get some cupcakes.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.603
It'll cheer him up.

10:05.637 --> 10:07.571
I think he prefers sprinkles to crumbs,

10:07.606 --> 10:08.973
- for what it's worth.
- Cupcakes.

10:09.007 --> 10:10.107
Mmm.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.810
Nobody wants cupcakes, Hugh.

10:12.844 --> 10:14.512
Yes!

10:14.546 --> 10:16.347
They have peanut butter mocha fudge today.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.753
You okay?

10:22.788 --> 10:24.288
Fuck, no.

10:24.322 --> 10:26.590
I just got my asshole torn apart in there.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.260
Yeah, just dust yourself
off, get back in there.

10:29.294 --> 10:30.528
That's all you can do.

10:30.562 --> 10:32.096
Why didn't you stick up for me?

10:32.130 --> 10:34.031
'Cause you fucked up.

10:34.065 --> 10:36.167
You know, those people take
their lunches very seriously.

10:36.201 --> 10:38.135
I've never seen anything like it, actually.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.605
- Can I get a cigarette?
- Mm-mm.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.009
That shit was really fucking
uncalled for... you know it.

10:45.043 --> 10:47.945
Did he hit you? Did he fire you?

10:47.979 --> 10:50.548
Did he stick his finger up
your ass and make you smell it?

10:50.582 --> 10:52.283
- No, I don't think so.
- No.

10:52.317 --> 10:53.717
I think you'd know.

10:53.752 --> 10:55.553
He didn't.

10:55.587 --> 10:57.788
So just, you know, do better tomorrow.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.790
My whole life has been
about doing better tomorrow.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.526
It's a sound philosophy.
I just don't know, man.

11:02.561 --> 11:05.362
This show-business stuff
is really high stakes.

11:05.397 --> 11:07.898
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the
business of chopped salads

11:07.933 --> 11:09.667
is some cutthroat shit, isn't it?

11:09.701 --> 11:11.902
You think that's bad? You
say you want to be an actor?

11:11.937 --> 11:14.038
You have any idea how much
rejection you're gonna face

11:14.072 --> 11:15.506
on a daily basis,

11:15.540 --> 11:17.908
especially looking the way you do?

11:17.943 --> 11:21.412
Which is absolutely fucking adorable.

11:23.415 --> 11:25.249
Can I get your advice on something?

11:25.283 --> 11:27.818
If you must.

11:27.853 --> 11:32.189
I-I really want to have
sex with Rath's assistant.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.859
Not... not today, in the future,
the not-too-distant future.

11:34.893 --> 11:36.694
Like, soon.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.929
Ah, it's good to have dreams.
Good to shoot for the moon.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.231
Yeah, but how do I get there, you know?

11:40.265 --> 11:41.665
Mm-hmm.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.367
Do I come on really strong, you know?

11:43.401 --> 11:44.835
- Nope. Mm-mm.
- Or do I play it cool?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.670
Yes, it's best to play it cool.

11:46.705 --> 11:50.040
Like... like, almost don't
even say anything to her, ever.

11:50.075 --> 11:52.042
Like... like, almost ignore her completely.

11:52.077 --> 11:54.011
Let her come to you.

11:54.045 --> 11:55.913
I'm... I'm not I sure I see
how that... that's gonna...

11:55.947 --> 11:58.115
Shh. Trust.

11:58.149 --> 11:59.617
Hey, sorry I blew up at you, kid.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.085
- Rite of passage.
- No problem.

12:01.119 --> 12:02.920
- Just get it right next time.
- Okay.

12:02.954 --> 12:05.122
When in doubt, you just
follow the fucking directions.

12:05.156 --> 12:07.625
- Okay.
- Like with actors...

12:07.659 --> 12:09.693
when in doubt, just say the fucking lines.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.295
Same thing applies to writers, right?

12:11.329 --> 12:13.564
When in doubt, just
follow the fucking note.

12:13.598 --> 12:15.199
You're getting a real
master class here today.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.368
Speaking of actors, you
want to join me in casting?

12:17.402 --> 12:19.703
- We're auditioning crack whores.
- Oh, yeah!

12:19.738 --> 12:21.805
Hey, that sounds cool. Can I come watch?

12:21.840 --> 12:24.375
No, but you can get me an iced half-caf,

12:24.409 --> 12:27.144
one pump sugar-free caramel,
two pumps sugar-free vanilla,

12:27.178 --> 12:29.046
nonfat caramel macchiato.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.714
Got that?

12:30.749 --> 12:32.583
Sure.

12:32.617 --> 12:34.818
Um, what... what was after "Iced"?

12:38.023 --> 12:40.324
Uh, you know what? I'll
just go ask your assistant.

12:40.358 --> 12:43.460
There you go. Now you're thinking, kid.

12:43.495 --> 12:46.297
All right.

12:48.833 --> 12:52.403
Danko, I know you're trying
to do the right thing,

12:52.437 --> 12:55.039
but I love the rock.

12:55.073 --> 12:59.543
The rock is my friend, my
lover, my "Confidantay."

12:59.578 --> 13:02.313
So I know you think you have magic

13:02.347 --> 13:05.983
there between your legs,
but when I put my dick...

13:06.017 --> 13:10.087
my li... but putting my
lips on that glass dick,

13:10.121 --> 13:12.556
that's the shit.

13:12.591 --> 13:16.594
That's all the dick this girl's gonna need.

13:18.296 --> 13:21.231
- Scene.
- Very good.

13:21.266 --> 13:22.633
I like the improv, the "glass dick" stuff.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.001
- Mm, yeah.
- Yeah, thank you.

13:24.035 --> 13:25.636
- Very creative.
- Thanks.

13:25.670 --> 13:28.739
I just... it just came on
me... came to me. It came...

13:28.773 --> 13:31.976
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

13:32.010 --> 13:33.744
I think you're a lot more talented

13:33.778 --> 13:36.447
than you think you are.

13:36.481 --> 13:37.848
Thank you.

13:37.882 --> 13:40.317
There was a real moment in there.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.585
I saw the price you paid.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.621
Oh. Thank you.

13:43.655 --> 13:45.122
No, thank you.

13:45.156 --> 13:47.257
And come back and see us again, please.

13:47.292 --> 13:48.425
Okay.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.931
Why do you keep saying that?

13:53.965 --> 13:56.266
"The... the price you
paid." What does that even...

13:56.301 --> 13:59.503
Fuck if I know.

13:59.537 --> 14:02.272
A director I worked with used it once.

14:02.307 --> 14:03.607
I thought it sounded good,

14:03.642 --> 14:06.176
so I incorporated it into my patter.

14:06.211 --> 14:07.645
It's good to have patter.

14:10.815 --> 14:12.016
Hello.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.617
I have the network for you two.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.185
They want to make an offer to Eddie Nero.

14:15.220 --> 14:16.654
Oh.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.622
Don't do it. You'll regret it.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.391
- Why?
- He poops on people.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.661
Nah, I'm not... I'm not kidding.

14:23.695 --> 14:26.664
You got to poop somewhere.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.134
So, acting, huh?

14:30.168 --> 14:33.203
- I want this part.
- Ah, but why?

14:33.238 --> 14:34.972
Because it's the kind of
part that gets you noticed,

14:35.006 --> 14:36.807
and I want to be noticed.

14:36.841 --> 14:38.375
As a crack whore?

14:38.410 --> 14:40.844
I want this part.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.379
Well, good luck to you.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.548
You know, may the best crack whore win.

14:44.582 --> 14:47.785
I will totally fuck you for this part.

14:47.819 --> 14:51.155
Oh, that is... that is totally sweet,

14:51.189 --> 14:53.857
but I'm not really what
you'd call a decision maker.

14:53.892 --> 14:56.860
I will suck your big black dick.

14:56.895 --> 14:59.463
How do you know about my big black dick?

14:59.497 --> 15:01.865
Oh! You were in character just then.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.634
That is... that's cool. That...

15:03.668 --> 15:07.037
you had a real moment there.
I-I saw the price you paid.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.539
You want to see my titties?

15:08.573 --> 15:11.308
That's... it's not necessary.

15:11.342 --> 15:12.876
We're a network show. We don't do...

15:12.911 --> 15:14.578
- Whoops.
- Titty.

15:14.612 --> 15:16.013
Wardrobe malfunction.

15:16.047 --> 15:17.915
Yeah.

15:17.949 --> 15:20.818
- You want to taste my juice?
- Oh, well, no, that's cool.

15:20.852 --> 15:24.088
I had some for breakfast already.

15:24.122 --> 15:25.823
Ooh.

15:25.857 --> 15:27.991
Hello, Frisco.

15:31.029 --> 15:32.529
Oh!

15:34.866 --> 15:37.034
- This is not as it seems.
- Fuck you, Hank.

15:37.068 --> 15:39.670
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this shit.

15:39.704 --> 15:42.439
- This... Rath, Rath, Ra...
- No, not now, Terry.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.675
I'm not in the mood for
your militant bullshit, okay?

15:44.709 --> 15:46.343
Please, go do something in the room.

15:46.377 --> 15:49.012
Make yourself useful, okay?

15:49.047 --> 15:51.381
Are we ready to do some thesping or what?

15:51.416 --> 15:53.016
What's that smell?

15:55.553 --> 15:58.255
Must be ambition. Let's do this.

15:58.289 --> 16:00.090
- What's that on the wall?
- Cock.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.192
And what color is it?

16:02.227 --> 16:04.228
- Black.
- It's black.

16:04.262 --> 16:05.763
It's a black clock.

16:05.797 --> 16:08.198
Big black cock.

16:10.535 --> 16:13.337
Holy shit. That is so funny.

16:13.371 --> 16:15.539
Little kids are hilarious.

16:15.573 --> 16:17.074
I know, right?

16:17.108 --> 16:19.810
- Oh, my gosh.
- Okay, now it's your turn.

16:19.844 --> 16:21.979
W-what do you mean?

16:22.013 --> 16:24.314
I showed you mine. Now you show me yours.

16:24.349 --> 16:26.550
Yeah, but my... my favorite stuff is...

16:26.584 --> 16:28.485
is definitely not safe for the workplace.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.754
Oh, pshh, that's okay. I mean, come on.

16:30.789 --> 16:33.223
This isn't, like, your typical workplace.

16:36.227 --> 16:38.695
- Okay, I'll show you some shit.
- Okay.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.330
And I really don't want
to fucking deal with this.

16:40.365 --> 16:42.232
Okay, okay. Hank! Hank, Hank.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.433
Can I see you in here a minute, please?

16:43.468 --> 16:45.869
Thank you, Terry.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.838
Have a seat.

16:47.872 --> 16:50.874
Don't mind if I do. What's up?

16:52.143 --> 16:53.443
Did you finger that actress?

16:53.478 --> 16:56.079
Oh, dear.

16:56.114 --> 16:57.681
Not exactly.

16:57.715 --> 17:00.184
What the fuck does that
mean, "Not exactly"?

17:00.218 --> 17:01.885
Either you finger someone, or you don't.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.287
Well, technically,

17:03.321 --> 17:06.790
she fingered herself... with my finger.

17:06.825 --> 17:08.858
That's why it smelled like pussy in there?

17:08.893 --> 17:11.862
No, that was ambition.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.696
Now I have to hire that crazy bitch.

17:13.731 --> 17:15.132
- Why?
- Why?

17:15.165 --> 17:16.867
Because if I don't,

17:16.901 --> 17:18.535
she's gonna claim that you
did something inappropriate

17:18.569 --> 17:19.869
- with your stink finger.
- Oh.

17:19.904 --> 17:21.438
And with your fucking record,

17:21.472 --> 17:23.640
no one's ever gonna believe you didn't.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.709
- I see.
- What?

17:25.742 --> 17:28.946
What's the matter, hon?
Did he finger you too?

17:28.980 --> 17:30.747
What did you make her watch?

17:30.782 --> 17:32.916
I-I didn't make her watch anything.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.484
Well, something fucking upset her.

17:34.519 --> 17:35.953
She was showing me

17:35.987 --> 17:38.055
some of her favorite YouTube videos, right?

17:38.089 --> 17:40.557
And she asked me to show
her something that I liked.

17:40.592 --> 17:41.892
And?

17:41.926 --> 17:43.927
It... it's kind of dirty.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.896
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

17:45.930 --> 17:48.565
Well, speaking of big boys.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.934
This huge, prison
yard-looking motherfucker

17:50.969 --> 17:53.470
is having anal sex with this
cute little porno chick, right?

17:53.504 --> 17:55.239
- Here we go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:55.273 --> 17:57.074
So he's just banging away and banging away,

17:57.108 --> 17:58.909
- but that's not the cool part.
- No.

17:58.943 --> 18:00.410
At a key point in the video,

18:00.445 --> 18:02.746
the guy pulls his monster
cock out of her butt,

18:02.780 --> 18:04.748
and shoves his entire scrotus in there.

18:04.782 --> 18:07.117
And this thing is ridiculous.

18:07.151 --> 18:09.419
It's literally like a giant
gym bag full of basketballs.

18:09.454 --> 18:11.154
So then... best of part of the video...

18:11.189 --> 18:13.257
he pulls it out again and yells, "Boo-yah!

18:13.291 --> 18:14.791
Boo-yah!"

18:17.528 --> 18:19.930
It... it's actually r-really funny.

18:19.964 --> 18:21.465
Yeah, no, it's fucking hilarious.

18:21.499 --> 18:23.600
Do you know what else
it is? Sexual harassment.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.769
What? She asked for it.

18:25.803 --> 18:28.505
- This is a workplace, Leon.
- Le... it's Levon.

18:28.539 --> 18:29.840
That's what I said.

18:29.874 --> 18:32.776
Look. It... it wasn't even sexual, though.

18:32.810 --> 18:36.546
It was comedic. I mean, was I turned on?

18:36.581 --> 18:38.649
Yes, because she's incredibly hot.

18:38.683 --> 18:40.117
But was I trying to fuck her? No.

18:40.151 --> 18:41.952
She said you started
to give her a back rub.

18:41.986 --> 18:45.789
- Jesus.
- She said that?

18:45.823 --> 18:47.391
You... you told me to play it cool.

18:47.425 --> 18:48.959
I did, I did.

18:48.993 --> 18:51.028
I told him to play it
cool. Well played, son.

18:51.062 --> 18:52.829
- Thanks, dad.
- Well played.

18:52.864 --> 18:54.464
The agent's on the phone.

18:54.499 --> 18:56.566
W-who? Which one?

18:56.601 --> 19:00.037
Oh, the one who represents
the actress that Hank fingered.

19:00.071 --> 19:02.272
Happy?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.474
You fingered an actress
today? Where the fuck was I?

19:04.509 --> 19:07.277
You were busy sexually
harassing my assistant.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.713
Jesus Christ! Like father, like son.

19:09.747 --> 19:13.517
Two real, live degenerate assholes.

19:13.551 --> 19:15.686
Get the fuck out of here, now.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.225
So what are we talking about here?

19:22.260 --> 19:23.794
Are we... are we fired?

19:23.828 --> 19:25.295
Does it look like I
fire people around here?

19:25.330 --> 19:26.964
Have you seen this fucking office?

19:26.998 --> 19:30.400
It's a fucking clown college out there.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.469
Get out!

19:32.503 --> 19:35.472
- What were you thinking?
- What's the big deal?

19:35.506 --> 19:37.207
You can't do something like that at work.

19:37.241 --> 19:39.042
It's disrespectful.

19:39.077 --> 19:40.744
Says the guy who just got in
trouble for fingering someone.

19:40.778 --> 19:42.346
Hey, watch your tone, all right?

19:42.380 --> 19:43.580
You know what? Fuck this.

19:43.614 --> 19:45.148
Whoa, whoa. Where you going?

19:45.183 --> 19:46.483
- Home. I'm done.
- What, that's it?

19:46.517 --> 19:48.352
- You're just gonna quit?
- Yeah, why not?

19:48.386 --> 19:50.153
- It's a stupid fucking job anyways...
- Okay.

19:50.188 --> 19:52.055
fetching lunches for a
bunch of Hollywood assholes.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.857
All right, now we know why you
still live with your mother.

19:53.891 --> 19:55.492
Who the fuck are you?

19:55.526 --> 19:57.494
I'm just a guy who's
trying to make the best

19:57.528 --> 19:59.429
of an incredibly fucked-up situation.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.731
Yeah, well, don't bother.

20:00.765 --> 20:02.532
I'm sorry I came looking for you.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.167
Hey, don't start saying
things you can't take back.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.702
Who says I want to take it back?

20:05.737 --> 20:07.371
You're a fucking drama
queen, you know that?

20:07.405 --> 20:08.505
Yeah, which is why I'm gonna be

20:08.539 --> 20:10.340
a great fucking actor one day.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.075
You think you're gonna
be a great fucking actor?

20:12.110 --> 20:15.579
You can't even get through
one day as a fucking PA.

20:15.613 --> 20:17.714
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

20:17.749 --> 20:19.182
Yeah, fuck you.

20:19.217 --> 20:20.851
No, fuck you, you ungrateful little shit.

20:20.885 --> 20:22.219
I get you a job, and what do you do?

20:22.253 --> 20:23.387
You embarrass me.

20:23.421 --> 20:25.789
It won't happen again.

20:28.059 --> 20:29.593
Come on. Come on, Hank.

20:29.627 --> 20:31.528
Do that shit. Come on, baby.

20:31.562 --> 20:32.863
- Come on, Hank.
- Come on, Hank!

20:32.897 --> 20:34.598
Do it! Come on.

20:34.632 --> 20:36.800
No, come on... no!

20:36.834 --> 20:38.402
Yes!

20:38.436 --> 20:40.604
- Are you kidding me?
- That's my money!

20:43.107 --> 20:45.075
What the fuck is going on here?

20:45.109 --> 20:47.110
I won. I'm writing the episode.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.779
No, you're not.

20:48.813 --> 20:50.380
That's not the way it
works around here, Terry.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.915
I'll arm-wrestle you for it.

20:51.949 --> 20:53.884
And you will win. Of that, I have no doubt.

20:53.918 --> 20:56.620
But I assign the episodes.

20:56.654 --> 20:59.589
This place is a fucking freak show.

20:59.624 --> 21:01.658
What the fuck is this now?

21:01.692 --> 21:04.594
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I'm Julia, Levon's mom.

21:04.629 --> 21:06.730
Levon has something
he'd like to say to you.

21:06.764 --> 21:08.131
Do it.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.400
Hi... hi, Melanie.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.102
I'm... I'm very sorry I created

21:12.136 --> 21:13.837
a hostile working environment for you.

21:13.871 --> 21:15.138
I was just trying to make you laugh.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.907
I-I guess I got a little carried away.

21:16.941 --> 21:18.241
Yeah.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.509
It's partially my fault,

21:19.544 --> 21:21.078
because I had a very liberal attitude

21:21.112 --> 21:22.479
about Levon and pornography.

21:22.513 --> 21:24.081
Well, I guess it's okay.

21:24.115 --> 21:26.149
It was kind of funny when the guy's balls

21:26.184 --> 21:27.984
just popped out of her butt like that.

21:28.019 --> 21:29.553
I know, right?

21:29.620 --> 21:31.254
Just don't try to massage me again.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.123
I won't. I promise.

21:33.157 --> 21:34.624
- It was creepy.
- Got it.

21:34.659 --> 21:37.094
And your breath was horrible.

21:37.128 --> 21:38.795
Did you brush your teeth this morning?

21:38.830 --> 21:41.331
I forgot. Hank was rushing me.

21:41.365 --> 21:43.266
Did you floss last night?

21:43.301 --> 21:45.569
Mom, stop it.

21:45.603 --> 21:48.638
Okay, well...

21:48.673 --> 21:50.073
Mr. Rath, sir,

21:50.108 --> 21:52.409
I'm very sorry I fucked up lunch

21:52.443 --> 21:53.777
a-and disrespected your authority.

21:53.811 --> 21:55.112
It will not happen again, sir.

21:55.146 --> 21:56.813
Hey, whatever, kid. Shit happens.

21:56.848 --> 21:58.982
- You live and learn. Get me a diet coke.
- Yes, sir.

21:59.016 --> 22:00.917
- Rick Rath.
- Julia.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.853
- Everybody calls me Rath.
- Oh.

22:02.887 --> 22:05.789
Well, I'd appreciate it if
you didn't scream at my son.

22:05.823 --> 22:07.791
He's a human being, and
I'm sure you can find

22:07.825 --> 22:09.626
a better way to motivate your employees.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.862
Wow. Okay. This is really happening, huh?

22:11.896 --> 22:13.930
Um...

22:13.965 --> 22:15.398
How is it even remotely possible

22:15.433 --> 22:16.800
that you have kid that old?

22:16.834 --> 22:20.470
Oh, thank you. Um...

22:21.806 --> 22:23.607
Oh, right. Him.

22:23.641 --> 22:25.242
- Yeah, sorry.
- Okay.

22:25.276 --> 22:27.410
I'm... I'm waiting. Where's my apology?

22:27.445 --> 22:30.347
I do have something I'd like to say to you.

22:30.381 --> 22:33.650
Who the fuck do you think you
are coming down on him so hard?

22:33.684 --> 22:35.018
That doesn't sound like an apology.

22:35.052 --> 22:36.686
You got to put in some serious time

22:36.721 --> 22:38.021
before you tear into him like that.

22:38.055 --> 22:39.689
He is my son.

22:39.724 --> 22:41.324
I mean, you're just a
sperm donor at this point.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.592
Why don't you try being his friend?

22:42.627 --> 22:44.361
What do you know about him? Nothing.

22:44.395 --> 22:46.363
Boo-yah. Moody just got schooled.

22:46.397 --> 22:48.365
Well, maybe I overreacted a tad,

22:48.399 --> 22:50.267
but the boy is in need
of some male guidance.

22:50.301 --> 22:53.270
Hey, I think this woman
is doing a fantastic job.

22:53.304 --> 22:54.938
This kid's got excellent manners.

22:54.972 --> 22:57.007
She brought cookies. Which are amazing.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.608
Why don't you find some patience, Hank?

22:58.643 --> 23:00.310
And don't be a fucking asshole.

23:00.344 --> 23:03.613
Well said, Julia.

23:03.648 --> 23:07.284
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

23:07.318 --> 23:09.019
Have you ever done any acting?

23:09.053 --> 23:11.121
Oh, years ago, in New York.

23:11.155 --> 23:12.455
- New York?
- Yeah.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.791
- I'm from New York.
- Oh, cool. Wow.

23:14.825 --> 23:17.527
Well, yeah, I did some
theater and a few commercials,

23:17.562 --> 23:18.828
but I wasn't very good.

23:18.863 --> 23:20.330
You know what?

23:20.364 --> 23:22.966
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.068
I think you're probably a lot more talented

23:25.102 --> 23:27.070
than you think you are.

23:29.707 --> 23:31.308
Let me show you around.

23:31.342 --> 23:34.811
Take that, rapist.

23:34.845 --> 23:36.980
- So this is...
- Levon!

23:37.014 --> 23:38.748
Milk!

23:45.456 --> 23:48.858
I didn't see this
coming, Runks, not at all.

23:48.893 --> 23:50.994
Me either, buddy.

23:51.028 --> 23:52.862
Boy, you really take your
erections for granted, huh?

23:52.897 --> 23:54.197
I mean, you never imagine

23:54.232 --> 23:55.699
they're just gonna go away one day.

23:55.733 --> 23:57.000
How did you manage to steer this

23:57.034 --> 23:58.335
back around to your dick?

23:58.369 --> 24:00.003
I was just sharing about how my life

24:00.037 --> 24:02.505
has been turned inside out
and upside down right now.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.040
Well, mine too, you know?

24:04.075 --> 24:07.177
My dick isn't working.

24:07.211 --> 24:09.212
I can't make sweet love to my wife,

24:09.247 --> 24:11.448
who surely must be growing frustrated

24:11.482 --> 24:13.450
and doubting whether
she did the right thing

24:13.484 --> 24:14.884
getting back together with me.

24:14.919 --> 24:16.453
Well, at least you have a wife, Charlie.

24:16.487 --> 24:18.054
My relationship with Karen

24:18.089 --> 24:20.257
has never been more fucked
than it is right now.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.192
She managed to get past
the whole Mia thing, right?

24:22.226 --> 24:24.527
- Barely.
- Proof...

24:24.562 --> 24:26.529
Time heals all.

24:26.564 --> 24:27.797
Even broken dicks?

24:27.832 --> 24:30.033
Here's hoping.

24:33.571 --> 24:35.238
It's Marcy.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.374
"Come home and fuck your wife.

24:37.408 --> 24:39.576
"She's stoned and horny
and wants some daddy dick.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.244
"If it doesn't work,

24:41.279 --> 24:43.647
you can eat me out and use the verb."

24:43.681 --> 24:44.981
- What, the ve...
- Verb?

24:45.016 --> 24:46.449
- Vibe.
- Vibe.

24:46.484 --> 24:47.784
"Brator."

24:47.818 --> 24:50.253
"Stop at the store. We need milk."

24:50.288 --> 24:52.055
Go.

24:52.089 --> 24:53.890
Go forth. Do as you're told.

24:53.924 --> 24:55.592
Get your tongue ready for a workout.

24:55.626 --> 24:57.227
And... and don't forget the milk.

24:57.261 --> 25:00.230
And grab some booze too. We're almost out.

25:00.264 --> 25:04.134
What? You know I like me
a nightcap when I get home.

25:04.168 --> 25:07.737
And some pop chips. I
love me some pop chips.

25:07.772 --> 25:10.940
Working in TV has taught
me a lot about snack food.

25:10.975 --> 25:14.177
Pop chips!

25:30.995 --> 25:33.596
- What?
- Hi.

25:33.631 --> 25:37.133
What do you want, Hank?
I'm not in the mood.

25:37.168 --> 25:40.437
I-I just wanted to say
how sorry I am, you know?

25:40.471 --> 25:43.773
This... this whole thing has got me so nuts

25:43.808 --> 25:46.443
that I haven't really taken the time

25:46.477 --> 25:48.445
to appreciate how bananas
it must be for you.

25:48.479 --> 25:50.814
You know, and I know I
can't talk my way out of it

25:50.848 --> 25:52.716
or expect... expect it to blow over,

25:52.750 --> 25:54.684
but, you know, I just want you to know

25:54.719 --> 26:00.190
that I-I fully appreciate what
a big deal this is for you.

26:00.224 --> 26:03.193
Okay. What else can I do for you?

26:05.162 --> 26:08.898
I'm a halfway-decent
paternal-type person, aren't I?

26:08.933 --> 26:13.636
So that's what this is about.
You want your ego stroked.

26:13.671 --> 26:15.705
No, no, no, I-I... it's
just that I'm feeling

26:15.740 --> 26:17.574
pretty rusty right now and I just...

26:17.608 --> 26:21.644
No, you're feeling pretty
sorry for yourself about now.

26:21.679 --> 26:25.482
And that's a waste of time,
because this is life, Hank.

26:25.516 --> 26:28.251
You know, shit comes flying at you,

26:28.285 --> 26:29.886
and you got to deal with it.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.356
That's what defines you,
how you deal with it.

26:33.391 --> 26:36.059
You don't get points for wallowing.

26:36.093 --> 26:39.262
Well, that's funny, because I
have never felt more entitled

26:39.296 --> 26:43.233
to drink and contemplate
my job-like existence

26:43.267 --> 26:45.101
than I do right now.

26:45.136 --> 26:49.506
And you have a daughter who
has no idea what's coming.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.007
Lucky her.

26:51.041 --> 26:52.275
And you have this kid

26:52.309 --> 26:54.043
who's come looking for his father.

26:54.078 --> 26:55.578
I mean, it's a big deal.

26:55.613 --> 26:57.213
He's probably a raw nerve right now,

26:57.248 --> 26:59.883
and his mom all, like, freaked out

26:59.917 --> 27:02.886
and wondering how her life's gonna change.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.889
It's a lot.

27:05.923 --> 27:07.590
How about you?

27:07.625 --> 27:09.759
You don't got time to think about me, Hank.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.428
You got enough on your plate.

27:11.462 --> 27:14.297
Just don't give up on me, okay?

27:14.331 --> 27:16.433
I'm still me.

27:16.467 --> 27:20.703
We're still us.

27:20.738 --> 27:23.706
Good night, Hank.

27:23.741 --> 27:27.377
Good night.
