01:11.028 --> 01:12.280
Whoo!

01:14.031 --> 01:16.993
I can't miss.

01:17.034 --> 01:18.869
You gotta get yourself
one of these, buddy.

01:18.911 --> 01:21.497
Let me see that son of a bitch.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.749
I tell ya,
them fuckin' Germans...

01:23.791 --> 01:26.377
Boy, they know how to make
a fuckin' gun, don't they?

01:26.419 --> 01:28.754
It's Italian. Yeah, whatever.

01:28.796 --> 01:30.881
Finish your beer and
hang it up. I feel hot.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.260
All right.

01:47.273 --> 01:51.110
Hey, I got an easy shot for you.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.279
Christ, you know better than
to point that fuckin' thing at me.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.489
I hear you been sleepin'
with my wife!

01:57.408 --> 01:59.577
- Who told you that?
- Amanda!

01:59.619 --> 02:01.662
Amanda. That's right.

02:03.247 --> 02:05.750
Now, why... why would she
say something like that?

02:05.791 --> 02:08.169
What?

02:08.210 --> 02:09.669
I want to know.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.131
I don't think that matters
right now, Clay.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.008
I don't believe she
told you. What are you...

02:14.050 --> 02:15.468
Well, she did...

02:15.509 --> 02:20.389
In great detail,
Mr. Like to Do it from Behind.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.516
You know, Earl, this...
This is fucking crazy.

02:22.558 --> 02:25.227
I don't know what Amanda's
been telling you or why...

02:25.269 --> 02:28.189
I don't think you appreciate the
seriousness of this conversation!

02:28.230 --> 02:29.732
Goddamn it!

02:29.774 --> 02:32.276
Now...

02:32.318 --> 02:34.236
Come on, Earl. You're...

02:34.278 --> 02:36.697
You're not gonna shoot me. No?

02:36.739 --> 02:39.575
Now, I know you, buddy. And...

02:39.617 --> 02:41.911
You can't kill a deer, so just...

02:41.952 --> 02:44.580
Put the gun down.

02:44.622 --> 02:48.000
Just... Put it down.

02:51.003 --> 02:52.213
You're right.

02:52.254 --> 02:54.090
The fact is...

02:57.301 --> 02:59.720
you're gonna shoot me.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.764
Now I'm a little confused.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.766
I can't stop thinkin'
about it, Clay.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.601
Ever since she told me.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.062
She was a virgin
when we was married.

03:08.104 --> 03:11.399
Nah. I remember her being
a little wild in high school.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.776
You're straying!
Now pick up the gun!

03:13.818 --> 03:17.488
You know, you're making
way too much of this.

03:17.530 --> 03:21.242
I mean, we're both a little too
fuckin' drunk. Let's sober up a little.

03:21.283 --> 03:23.828
This is a little out of fuckin' control,
don't you think?

03:23.869 --> 03:26.914
I can't have the whole goddamn
town knowin' what happened!

03:26.956 --> 03:29.166
And it ain't easy for me,
you bein' my best friend and all,

03:29.166 --> 03:31.252
but you're gon' pay,
you son of a bitch.

03:31.293 --> 03:33.504
Not with your life,
but you're gonna do some time.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.297
That's for sure.

03:35.339 --> 03:37.299
Now, Earl...

03:37.341 --> 03:40.010
You're... You're a
little out of it right now.

03:40.052 --> 03:44.181
- Yeah, you think so?
- You're a little out of your mind.

03:46.183 --> 03:48.978
- Right now, yes, you're a little fuckin' crazy.
- Oh, yeah? Crazy?

03:49.019 --> 03:51.480
Crazy enough to tell people we
was comin' up here shootin' today?

03:51.522 --> 03:54.358
Crazy enough to tell Amanda that
me and you was gonna have it out...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.444
over this here very issue?

03:56.485 --> 03:59.029
Crazy enough to bring
both of the trucks up here?

03:59.071 --> 04:01.073
'Cause it'll be one thing
to hide my body.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.367
It's gon' be another thing getting
both these trucks outta here.

04:04.493 --> 04:08.247
I thought it all out, Clay.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.124
Now be a man
and pick up the gun.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.877
Earl, I'm not gonna
pick up the gun.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.464
Earl.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.632
Good luck explaining me dying
with a bullet from your gun, buddy.

04:18.673 --> 04:20.926
Put the gun down.

04:20.968 --> 04:22.553
I bet you don't think
I got the nerve, do ya?

04:22.595 --> 04:23.971
You got the nerve.
You got the fuckin' nerve!

04:24.013 --> 04:26.348
But you're scaring
the shit out of me!

04:26.390 --> 04:28.225
Jesus Christ!

04:31.228 --> 04:33.439
Earl! Put the fucking gun down!

04:33.481 --> 04:36.108
That's gonna rule out
the suicide angle, lover boy!

04:36.150 --> 04:38.194
It's not worth it!
She doesn't mean shit to me!

04:38.235 --> 04:40.112
I don't fucking care about her!

04:40.154 --> 04:41.906
Just don't fucking do this!

04:41.947 --> 04:44.116
No!

04:49.079 --> 04:50.790
What are you doin'?

04:50.831 --> 04:52.958
She's not worth it!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.920
She's not fuckin' worth it!

10:20.410 --> 10:22.329
Let's get around the other side.

10:27.126 --> 10:31.171
He went off right over there?

10:31.213 --> 10:32.881
Yeah, over there.

10:36.593 --> 10:39.179
That's his boot sittin'
on the transmission.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.889
Tell me the truth, Clay.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.894
Was he drinking?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.274
Mooney, it's Sunday.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.900
Yeah.

10:53.443 --> 10:56.196
You ever know Earl
to be sober on a Sunday?

10:58.198 --> 11:01.660
Whoo! Ain't a whole
hell of a lot left.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.579
You want me to call the coroner?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.624
He's in Wyoming, fishing.

11:09.459 --> 11:11.086
Well, we gotta call somebody.

11:12.629 --> 11:15.465
To tell us what?

11:15.507 --> 11:17.593
I always knew that
drunken son of a bitch...

11:17.634 --> 11:20.012
was gonna kill himself one day.

11:27.603 --> 11:31.815
"And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.027
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

12:13.023 --> 12:15.817
How about
gettin' me one, cowboy?

12:21.823 --> 12:23.867
Where's your car?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.661
In the garage.

12:25.702 --> 12:27.746
Gotta keep up appearances, baby.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.456
What are you doing here?

12:29.498 --> 12:33.210
What do you mean?
It's Wednesday.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.337
So what?

12:35.379 --> 12:38.590
So we always do it on Wednesday.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.718
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

12:41.718 --> 12:45.347
Amanda, the body
isn't even cold yet.

12:49.184 --> 12:50.894
Yeah, well...

12:50.936 --> 12:52.688
It got too hot to ever get cold.

12:52.729 --> 12:54.523
You saw to that,
didn't you, cowboy?

12:55.941 --> 12:59.069
- Shut up.
- Mmm.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.071
I'm just teasing you, baby.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.240
I must say you impressed me
though, Clay.

13:03.282 --> 13:07.327
It was pretty, um, slick
the way you handled that.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.121
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
have had to...

13:09.162 --> 13:11.081
if you'd just told
the fuckin' truth.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.917
Mmm, now don't start.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.129
I just...
didn't know what to do.

13:17.170 --> 13:22.426
I figured it'd be better if you did
the thinking for both of us. Hmm?

13:22.467 --> 13:24.261
Now come on.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.764
Kick off those boots
and come to mama.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.601
What is wrong with you?

13:31.643 --> 13:34.521
What do you mean,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

13:34.563 --> 13:36.773
He's dead! We don't have to sneak around anymore,
baby.

13:36.773 --> 13:39.651
We can do whatever
the fuck we want.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.321
Do you not get it?

13:42.362 --> 13:44.114
Earl killed himself over you.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.241
So what? He was crazy.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.702
I mean it.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.790
You will be, too,
if you try and make any more out of it than that.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.250
Now...

13:57.252 --> 13:59.629
Come on. Come on.

13:59.671 --> 14:02.716
We can use the video
camera. Come on.

14:02.758 --> 14:07.262
You know,
we are not just gonna pick up where we left off.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.766
I mean, people would talk.

14:11.808 --> 14:13.769
And I know how you hate that.

14:14.936 --> 14:17.522
Fine.

14:17.564 --> 14:20.692
But I ain't waitin' long, Clay.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.612
I'm a single fuckin' woman now,

14:23.653 --> 14:26.406
and this town ain't exactly blessed
with eligible fuckin' bachelors.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.454
We never made any plans,
you and I. Never.

14:33.705 --> 14:35.999
Yeah.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.459
Maybe not.

14:39.711 --> 14:41.838
But there's a bond between us.

14:41.838 --> 14:44.132

29:24.804 --> 29:28.099
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

29:28.140 --> 29:30.559
Well, it seems like we got
a long day ahead of us.

29:30.601 --> 29:33.521
We gotta go see the sheriff.
Then back to the lake.

29:33.562 --> 29:35.940
Then, you know, answer
a bunch of questions.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.900
Yeah.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.111
Well, I'm due in Billings
this afternoon,

29:40.152 --> 29:44.448
and, uh, truth be told,
I'm not in real good graces with my boss.

29:44.490 --> 29:48.119
If I'm late again, actually,
I could be out of a job.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.622
- We gotta report this thing.
- Oh, I know that. I know that.

29:51.664 --> 29:52.873
I was just wondering, you know,

29:52.915 --> 29:54.667
maybe you could do it yourself.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.961
- What? Do what?
- Leave me out of it.

29:57.003 --> 30:00.548
You know, just say you went
fishing alone maybe.

30:00.589 --> 30:02.842
I think we both ought
to be there, Lester.

30:02.883 --> 30:05.845
Hell, it ain't like I saw
anything you didn't see.

30:05.886 --> 30:08.556
Look, you were fishing, right?
Body washes up.

30:08.597 --> 30:10.182
End of deposition.

30:10.224 --> 30:12.393
I don't like taking chances
when it comes to the law.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.395
You're not doing anything wrong.

30:14.437 --> 30:18.274
You're just reporting what
you saw. You trust me.

30:38.085 --> 30:39.670
I appreciate it, Clay.

30:39.712 --> 30:42.506
Yeah, well, can't have you
losing your job.

30:42.548 --> 30:46.677
Right on,
man. Right on. And I won't forget this either.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.555
All right. We'll see you now.

30:51.724 --> 30:54.226
Hey, Clay!

30:54.268 --> 30:56.979
What do I say if someone
asks if I caught anything?

31:04.737 --> 31:06.405
Howdy, boys.

31:15.081 --> 31:19.335
- You were out in the middle there.
- Yeah. Just over there.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.589
Man puts a body in a lake,

31:25.257 --> 31:28.427
the idea is to keep it
at the bottom.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.141
Give me one of those.

31:48.030 --> 31:52.201
How's Amanda holding up?

31:52.243 --> 31:55.371
Don't know. I haven't seen her around much lately,
tell you the truth.

31:56.705 --> 31:59.208
You should check in on her.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.710
She always liked you.

32:02.878 --> 32:04.547
I'll do that.

32:07.842 --> 32:10.094
Is, uh... ls there anything else?

32:10.136 --> 32:12.721
No. Go home.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.062
- Promise me something though, will you?
- What's that?

32:22.440 --> 32:25.276
Promise you'll stop
finding dead people.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.778
Mmm.

32:46.672 --> 32:49.383
Clay!

32:49.425 --> 32:52.136
Yeah? When you're done there,
come on over.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.054
I want to talk to you.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.682
Okay.

33:10.946 --> 33:16.160
I understand you went out
with Gloria Collins last week.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.996
Yeah. We went out. Saw a movie.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.957
Hung out a little.

33:21.957 --> 33:24.710
What did you do after that?

33:24.752 --> 33:27.171
That's kind of personal, Mooney.

33:27.213 --> 33:30.132
Answer the question.

33:31.383 --> 33:35.012
After, uh, this wonderful movie,

33:35.054 --> 33:38.307
we went to my place and, uh,
you know, fooled around a little.

33:39.558 --> 33:41.519
Did she stay the night?

33:41.560 --> 33:43.395
No.

33:43.437 --> 33:47.024
She left, I don't know,
around 2:00 or so.

33:47.066 --> 33:50.027
And that was the last
you heard from her?

33:50.069 --> 33:51.987
Yeah.

34:02.331 --> 34:04.500
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

34:06.168 --> 34:08.045
Tell you what?

34:08.087 --> 34:11.005
You knew she was missing,
didn't you?

34:14.760 --> 34:17.554
Yeah. I...

34:17.596 --> 34:19.598
I don't know. I just...
I wasn't thinking.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.518
Sorry. I didn't know how what I
knew would help you out at all.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.233
Next time,

34:29.275 --> 34:32.360
you let me be the judge of that.

34:32.402 --> 34:33.821
All right.

34:35.030 --> 34:36.699
That's all for now.

34:40.869 --> 34:42.538
See you later.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.583
Oh, Clay?

34:46.625 --> 34:49.295
About that business at the lake.

34:49.335 --> 34:51.422
What?

34:51.463 --> 34:54.800
You know, we still haven't
got an I.D. on her.

34:54.842 --> 34:58.178
Did you get
a very good look at her?

34:58.220 --> 35:00.306
Not really, no.

35:01.724 --> 35:04.018
All we know for sure
is she was stabbed to death.

35:07.146 --> 35:09.565
Seven times.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.069
Stabbed, huh?

35:35.507 --> 35:39.553
Hi, Clay. You talking to Mooney?

35:39.595 --> 35:43.015
I'm sorry, but this really
isn't a good time, okay?

35:43.057 --> 35:46.935
Bullshit. He knows Gloria and I
were together that night.

35:46.977 --> 35:49.146
Now, he must have
heard it from you.

35:49.188 --> 35:52.816
You got any beer?
I got company, cowboy.

35:52.858 --> 35:55.527
Hey, Clay! How are you, man?
Good to see you.

35:55.569 --> 35:58.072
Lester? Do you know each other?

35:58.113 --> 36:01.075
Yeah. Me and Clay
are fishing buddies.

36:01.116 --> 36:03.661
Uh, I thought
you were in Billings.

36:03.702 --> 36:07.665
I was in Billings, but just dumped
my load up and decided to come back.

36:07.706 --> 36:10.167
I hate to break this up,
but Clay was just Ieavin'. Weren't ya, Clay?

36:10.209 --> 36:13.587

36:20.386 --> 36:21.845
Hey, Clay!

36:21.887 --> 36:24.890
Hey, Clay. Hey.

36:24.932 --> 36:27.184
Hell, you don't mind about
that or nothing, do you?

36:27.226 --> 36:29.019
No. Hell, no, I...

36:29.061 --> 36:31.689
I felt a little bit.
But you're okay with it?

36:31.730 --> 36:33.691
Hell, I figured I was
probably doing you a favor.

36:33.732 --> 36:35.901
You know, smooth out
the pavement a little bit.

36:35.943 --> 36:38.362
How'd you hook up
with her anyway?

36:38.404 --> 36:40.781
Oh, I went over
to that Doc Holiday's...

36:40.823 --> 36:43.951
looking for a little bit
of the shush, the bad.

36:43.992 --> 36:46.620
And, uh, there she was,
you know? Just...

36:46.662 --> 36:48.956
"I'm sorry your dad treated
you like that. That's awful."

36:48.997 --> 36:50.749
Next thing I know, here we are.

36:50.791 --> 36:54.628
Besides, she really ain't
that bad a piece of ass.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.005
After all, I mean, she's...

36:57.047 --> 36:59.049

I really appreciate it, Clay.

44:24.327 --> 44:25.871

All right, man.

like this before.

47:28.762 --> 47:32.223
Agent Shelby.

47:32.265 --> 47:35.435
- Hi. Are you Sheriff Mooney?
- Yeah.

47:35.477 --> 47:36.770
How you doing? Dale Shelby, FBI.

47:36.811 --> 47:38.438
This is Agent Reynard.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.565
May we see the body, please?

47:53.286 --> 47:56.206
When was she discovered?

47:56.247 --> 47:58.625
A couple hours ago.

47:58.666 --> 48:00.835
Meter man saw her.

48:00.835 --> 48:03.755
Meter's right outside
the window.

48:03.797 --> 48:06.174
Has the weapon been recovered?

48:06.216 --> 48:07.801
No.

48:07.842 --> 48:10.470
Hey, Sher.

48:10.512 --> 48:12.180
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

48:12.222 --> 48:14.849
You're standing in evidence.

48:14.849 --> 48:17.143
God.

48:23.566 --> 48:25.026
Hey.

48:25.068 --> 48:26.319
Uh, there's a really big crowd
out there.

48:26.361 --> 48:28.363
You want me to run 'em off?

48:28.405 --> 48:30.698
Just keep them off the property.

48:30.740 --> 48:35.161
- Okay, Barney?
- Yes, sir, Sheriff.

48:36.454 --> 48:39.707
Your deputy's name is Barney?

48:39.749 --> 48:42.252
Yeah.

48:42.293 --> 48:44.587
That's great.

48:54.848 --> 48:56.641
Excuse me, excuse me.

48:56.683 --> 48:59.269
Who are all these people?

48:59.310 --> 49:02.814
Well, they're
the state police...

49:02.856 --> 49:05.358
the fire chief, and...

49:05.400 --> 49:06.693
a couple of councilmen.

49:06.734 --> 49:08.987
Why is the fire chief here?

49:09.028 --> 49:11.197
Well, he's done
some police work before.

49:11.239 --> 49:12.615
I thought it couldn't hurt.

49:12.657 --> 49:15.493
And how about the councilmen?

49:15.535 --> 49:17.996
Well, uh...

49:18.037 --> 49:20.039
they wanted to come.

49:20.081 --> 49:23.001
You know, ordinarily,
I say the more the merrier.

49:23.042 --> 49:25.170
I do. I say it all the time.

49:25.211 --> 49:28.006
But, uh, a murder scene
is not really crowd appropriate.

49:28.047 --> 49:32.427
So could we just make sure
that nobody touches anything?

49:32.469 --> 49:36.264
Thank you so much.

49:38.308 --> 49:42.103
Anybody seen this?

49:42.145 --> 49:43.688
No.

49:43.730 --> 49:47.525
- What do you suppose...
- He cleaned up afterwards.

49:53.823 --> 49:55.492
Bingo.

50:05.418 --> 50:07.795
Mm-hmm.

50:18.681 --> 50:20.975
How well did you know Amanda?

50:20.975 --> 50:22.560
Pretty well.

50:22.602 --> 50:23.978
What was she like?

50:23.978 --> 50:25.855
Honest.

50:25.897 --> 50:27.857
Meaning?

50:27.899 --> 50:31.819
Amanda wasn't the nicest
person in the world.

50:54.509 --> 50:57.971
I told Dr. Jaffe
to meet us here.

51:21.661 --> 51:23.663
Did you catch somebody?

51:28.876 --> 51:31.212
The wounds were all made
with the same knife,

51:31.254 --> 51:33.339
probably a standard
kitchen knife.

51:33.381 --> 51:35.341
The fatal blow entered
just below the shoulder blade

51:35.383 --> 51:40.555
where it pierced her heart
and her left lung.

51:40.597 --> 51:42.682
How long has her husband
been dead?

51:42.724 --> 51:45.059
Oh, about a month.

51:45.059 --> 51:47.186
Has she been seeing anyone
since that time?

51:47.228 --> 51:49.564
Not that I know of.

51:49.606 --> 51:53.067
Excuse me.
Any signs of sexual assault?

51:53.067 --> 51:56.112
No. But she did have intercourse
within two hours of her death.

51:56.154 --> 51:58.364
How many of the wounds
were postmortem?

51:58.406 --> 52:00.074
Almost all of them.

52:00.074 --> 52:03.828
I counted more than 40 points
of entry in all.

52:04.996 --> 52:07.498
Let me show you.

52:16.591 --> 52:19.218
The first thing that
I'm gonna do when I get back

52:19.260 --> 52:21.429
is to get some decent food.

52:24.474 --> 52:26.184
I've tasted better,
you know what I'm saying?

52:30.688 --> 52:32.899
You pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.

52:32.940 --> 52:34.525
Uh-huh.

52:34.567 --> 52:38.696
Now you know what it's made of.

52:38.738 --> 52:40.490
I don't wanna talk
about what it's made of.

52:40.531 --> 52:44.202
I'm eating this.

52:54.128 --> 52:55.838
Small cheese pie.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.257
- Okay, what do I owe you?
- Uh, 7.50.

53:12.855 --> 53:14.649
Whatever floats your boat.

53:14.691 --> 53:16.109
Keep it.

53:16.150 --> 53:18.111
Oh, thanks.

53:29.831 --> 53:31.666
<i>Ah, Go...</i>

53:47.056 --> 53:48.891
Why don't you start
by describing

53:48.933 --> 53:50.435
your relationship with Amanda?

53:50.476 --> 53:53.187
- We were friends.
- Nothing more?

53:53.187 --> 53:54.647
No.

54:04.741 --> 54:06.784
Do you like movies, Clay?

54:08.745 --> 54:10.705
And can I call you Clay?

54:10.747 --> 54:12.373
Sure.

54:12.415 --> 54:15.626
Sure you like movies,
or sure I can call you Clay?

54:15.668 --> 54:19.130
Sure you can call me Clay,
and I like movies.

54:19.172 --> 54:21.215
I mean, you got to living
in a town like this, right?

54:23.509 --> 54:25.219
Amanda was quite a fan too.
Did you know that?

54:26.637 --> 54:28.139
No, I didn't.

54:28.181 --> 54:30.183
She had a very extensive
video collection.

54:30.224 --> 54:33.269
Most of the stuff
was not really my taste.

54:33.311 --> 54:35.980
Low-brow comedies, action junk,

54:36.022 --> 54:38.149
things of that nature.

54:38.191 --> 54:41.569
But I was very bored in my motel room,
so I decided to borrow one of her videos.

54:41.611 --> 54:45.114
- You ever seen Alien?
- I think so, a long time ago.

54:45.156 --> 54:47.408
It's a great flick.
Very empowering.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.911
Although small screen, shitty dub,
is not really the way to experience it.

54:49.952 --> 54:54.165
But I was just watching it,
minding my own business, and guess what happened.

54:56.209 --> 54:59.378
Let's find out.

55:11.557 --> 55:13.142
Oh, God!

55:26.364 --> 55:28.616
So you're a full-service
garage, eh?

55:32.453 --> 55:34.372
That was really impressive,
Mr. DeMille.

55:34.413 --> 55:36.207
When did you shoot that?

55:37.959 --> 55:40.753
A couple of months ago. Yeah.

55:40.795 --> 55:42.588
She said she was gonna
record over it,

55:42.630 --> 55:44.590
but I guess she didn't.

55:44.632 --> 55:47.009
No.

55:54.851 --> 55:57.186
Why didn't you tell me
about you two?

55:57.228 --> 56:01.232
We were having an affair,
Mooney.

56:01.274 --> 56:03.901
That's not the kind of thing
you talk about.

56:05.319 --> 56:07.196
What do you know
about Carol Pierce?

56:11.325 --> 56:13.411
Who's Carol Pierce?

56:15.162 --> 56:17.665
The woman whose body you found
floating in Bear Lake.

56:20.918 --> 56:22.962
I've never heard
the name before.

56:23.004 --> 56:25.172
She's been missing about two,
two and a half months.

56:25.214 --> 56:27.174
She was last seen
in the Great Falls area.

56:27.216 --> 56:30.595
Do you ever get up there
for any reason? Great Falls.

56:31.929 --> 56:33.764
Wait a minute.

56:33.806 --> 56:35.725
Mooney, what's she trying to do?

56:35.766 --> 56:38.519
I'm not trying to do anything.
I'm trying to tell you something.

56:38.561 --> 56:40.646
She was stabbed...
Just like Amanda...

56:40.688 --> 56:42.690
and just like
seven other women...

56:42.732 --> 56:45.359
who have turned up dead in
this state over the last two years.

56:45.359 --> 56:48.112
We've also got five women missing,
including Gloria Collins.

56:48.154 --> 56:49.906
So why don't you quit
dicking around...

56:49.947 --> 56:51.574
and tell me
what you know about her?

56:51.616 --> 56:54.160
This is crazy. This
is really fucking crazy.

56:54.201 --> 56:56.579
Mooney, tell her
that this is crazy.

56:58.289 --> 57:01.208
You were the last person
to be seen with her.

57:01.250 --> 57:03.502
I'm not answering
any more questions.

57:03.544 --> 57:06.756
- You got to admit it's a big coincidence.
- What?

57:06.797 --> 57:09.425
You're sleeping with one victim,
you're dating another,

57:09.467 --> 57:11.802
and you actually found a third.

57:13.721 --> 57:15.139
Come on.

57:17.850 --> 57:19.602
We're a little curious.

57:19.644 --> 57:22.313
You know, I'm not
talking anymore.

57:22.355 --> 57:23.981
All right, Mooney,
I want a lawyer.

57:26.067 --> 57:28.486
You don't need a lawyer, Clay.

57:28.527 --> 57:30.529
You're not being charged
with anything.

57:30.571 --> 57:34.742
But I do think you can help us.

57:34.784 --> 57:38.579
There's bound to be
something you saw or heard...

57:38.621 --> 57:40.748
that might lead us
to the killer.

57:55.012 --> 57:57.682
Look, why don't you go on home
and think about it.

57:59.517 --> 58:02.228
Maybe you're
forgetting something.

58:02.269 --> 58:04.981
If anything comes to you,

58:05.022 --> 58:06.691
you give me a call.

58:17.201 --> 58:20.246
Hey, Mooney? Do me a favor?

58:20.287 --> 58:23.124
You make sure that tape
doesn't get out. Okay?

58:23.165 --> 58:25.334
You've got my word.

58:36.220 --> 58:38.264
He's not your man.

58:38.305 --> 58:39.807
Why?

58:39.849 --> 58:42.810
Let me ask you something.

58:42.852 --> 58:46.647
Why would he lead us
to one of the bodies?

58:46.689 --> 58:48.649
That doesn't make any sense.

58:48.691 --> 58:50.943
We're not talking
about rational thought here.

58:50.985 --> 58:52.570
Sometimes people
want to be caught.

58:52.611 --> 58:54.113
Sometimes they're
crying out for help.

58:54.155 --> 58:56.198
Sometimes they push the envelopes,
they taunt us.

58:56.240 --> 58:57.575
No.

58:57.616 --> 58:59.493
Clay is a nice guy.

59:00.995 --> 59:04.415
They're all... nice guys.

59:14.050 --> 59:15.676
Hello?

59:15.718 --> 59:17.678
Hey, buddy.

59:17.720 --> 59:19.221
Lester.

59:19.263 --> 59:21.057
Yeah, one and the same.

59:21.098 --> 59:23.893
Listen,
Clay. I think me and you should get together.

59:25.811 --> 59:27.271
Hello?

59:27.313 --> 59:29.815
- Are you there?
- Clayborne?

59:29.857 --> 59:31.692
Y-Yeah, I'm here.

59:31.734 --> 59:34.487
Listen,
I'm gonna be up your way later on tonight.

59:34.528 --> 59:35.780
So where's a place
me and you can meet?

59:35.821 --> 59:37.490
You know, something comfortable.

59:37.531 --> 59:40.743
Um, what about Doc Holiday's?

59:40.785 --> 59:42.244
Oh.

59:42.286 --> 59:45.081
No, I don't think so, Clay.

59:45.122 --> 59:48.084
You know,
I don't think me and you should be seen together.

59:48.125 --> 59:49.543
Do you?

01:00:08.145 --> 01:00:09.980
Hey, Clay.

01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:14.235
I didn't think you'd show.

01:00:15.736 --> 01:00:18.155
Just had to make sure that...

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:20.116
you weren't followed, my man.

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.452
Huh.

01:00:23.494 --> 01:00:25.955
Boy, don't this
bring back memories?

01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:30.292
Why? Why? Easy,
buddy! Easy, buddy!

01:00:30.334 --> 01:00:32.378
Don't get all riled
up on me now! Why?

01:00:32.419 --> 01:00:35.131
Don't get riled up on me now,
boy! Get your fuckin'...

01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:37.383
Go slow, son. Take it slow.

01:00:37.424 --> 01:00:38.884
Take it slow.

01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:42.346
Take your ass slow, boy.
I told you now.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:44.390
Play nice
with your big daddy here.

01:00:44.431 --> 01:00:46.225
Why?

01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:48.394
Why? I was doing
you a goddamn favor.

01:00:48.435 --> 01:00:50.020
I never asked you
to fucking kill her!

01:00:50.062 --> 01:00:51.564
Well, you're not sorry
she's gone, are you?

01:00:51.605 --> 01:00:53.566
They think I did it.

01:00:53.607 --> 01:00:55.609
No,
they don't. They think I did all of 'em.

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:01.198
They don't have nothing on you.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.576
It'll all blow over in a week.

01:01:03.617 --> 01:01:05.578
Jesus Christ.

01:01:05.619 --> 01:01:07.913
Bring down the
temperature a little bit.

01:01:07.955 --> 01:01:12.001
It won't take that long
if I tell them about you.

01:01:12.042 --> 01:01:14.461
- But you won't do that.
- Yeah? Why not?

01:01:14.503 --> 01:01:17.214
Well, you already
had your chance, Clay.

01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:20.718
But you didn't do it, did you?

01:01:22.636 --> 01:01:26.640
I think you're a little worried
about what old Amanda told me.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:35.316
I mean, here you got
two guys fishing,

01:01:35.357 --> 01:01:37.902
and then out of
the middle of nowhere,

01:01:37.943 --> 01:01:41.405
all of a sudden,
a body washes up?

01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:44.992
That's not the kind of
thing you see every day.

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:49.246
But yet, neither of us seemed
all that surprised by it, man.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.042
You know,
what I can't understand...

01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:55.669
is how come, after
you dropped me off,

01:01:55.669 --> 01:01:57.880
you didn't just
come back here...

01:01:57.922 --> 01:02:00.633
and throw her ass
right back in the lake.

01:02:00.674 --> 01:02:02.760
Nobody would have
known. I didn't kill her.

01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:05.846
I believe you. I
said it. I believe you.

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:07.306
I believe you, Clay.

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:10.142
But I don't think
that anybody else would.

01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:12.186
How many have there been?

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:14.355
Oh, come on now, Clay.

01:02:14.396 --> 01:02:17.691
Oh, let's not get
into that shit.

01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:19.568
I want to know.

01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:28.702
You wouldn't be trying to play
detective or anything with me, would you?

01:02:30.204 --> 01:02:32.498
You know if I go down,
you go with me.

01:02:32.539 --> 01:02:34.917
So why not tell me?

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:37.920
Well, there's a few
they don't know about.

01:02:39.838 --> 01:02:42.925
But that's just
the way it is, Clay.

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:45.678
Some people can just, uh,

01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:47.513
disappear.

01:02:47.554 --> 01:02:50.349
Nobody misses 'em.

01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:53.018
What, Mama Lester
didn't love you?

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.395
Don't lower yourself.

01:02:54.436 --> 01:02:58.190
Don't lower it!
Don't lower yourself!

01:02:58.232 --> 01:03:00.567
Seems to me like you're the
last person in the goddamn world...

01:03:00.609 --> 01:03:03.696
that should be asking me
a fuckin' question like that.

01:03:03.737 --> 01:03:05.698
I saw you that night, Clay.

01:03:05.739 --> 01:03:07.908
Uh-huh. I saw the way...

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.912
you handled her like that.

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:14.164
What, because I slapped Amanda?

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:18.085
I didn't mean to hit her.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.545
Sure you did.

01:03:19.586 --> 01:03:22.089
But who knows, Clay? Who knows?

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.175
If there hadn't been a bunch
of people around you there,

01:03:26.593 --> 01:03:28.304
well, you might
not have stopped...

01:03:28.345 --> 01:03:30.264
just with a little old "whacky."

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:35.144
You're fucked.

01:03:35.185 --> 01:03:37.313
Am I?

01:03:39.606 --> 01:03:41.233
It's all very simple, Clay.

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:44.069
There are some people
out there...

01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:46.947
that need... need killin'.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:52.578
You know, you should've heard some
of the shit that she was saying after.

01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:58.250
You know, she even tried
telling me that, uh,

01:03:58.292 --> 01:04:01.587
you had something to do
with her husband dying.

01:04:01.628 --> 01:04:04.465
Now, can you fuckin'
believe that one?

01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:11.388
That little bitch got me
so fucking pissed off, man!

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.515
That's why I lost
fucking control with her!

01:04:13.557 --> 01:04:17.186
That's why I made
such a goddamn fucking mess!

01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:21.106
Usually I'm pretty clean
about it all.

01:04:22.691 --> 01:04:25.444
But, uh...

01:04:25.486 --> 01:04:28.614
Aw, hell.
That's all over with now.

01:04:28.655 --> 01:04:31.116
Well, it isn't for me.
Patience, buddy.

01:04:32.242 --> 01:04:34.286
Can you try that?

01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:37.498
The big "P" word? Patience?

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:42.795
Hell, Clay,
I don't blame you for being sore.

01:04:42.836 --> 01:04:45.798
Fuck,
man. I put you in a spot. I know that.

01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:51.387
But one of these days, Clay,

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:55.891
you're gonna look back,

01:04:55.933 --> 01:04:58.852
you're gonna realize I did the
world a great service that night.

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:06.777
You think about it.

01:05:17.871 --> 01:05:20.833
Yeah, he did seem a little nervous
the other day when he came in.

01:05:20.874 --> 01:05:24.378
All right. Okay.
Well, thank you.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.296
You're welcome.

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.688
Hey, Clay.

01:05:58.203 --> 01:06:00.372
Hi.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.167
Get dressed.

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:35.532
Barney.

01:06:35.574 --> 01:06:38.952
Could you not poke the body
with a stick, please?

01:06:40.787 --> 01:06:42.748
I was just seein' somethin'.

01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:44.208
Thank you.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.045
It's time we dragged the lake.

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.173
Yeah.

01:06:56.845 --> 01:06:58.889
Mooney.

01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.516
Clay.

01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:04.937
I'm missing work, you know.

01:07:04.978 --> 01:07:06.355
Yeah.

01:07:06.396 --> 01:07:08.649
Well, this won't take long.

01:07:16.406 --> 01:07:20.786
The woman whose body you found
floating in Bear Lake.

01:07:20.827 --> 01:07:25.165
We've also got
five women missing.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.876
There are some people
out there...

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:30.879
that need... need killin'.

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:32.339
Clay.

01:07:34.007 --> 01:07:35.759
Right in here.

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:39.763
Disgusting smell, isn't it?

01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:43.016
What do you want?

01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:50.524
Gloria Collins
isn't missing anymore.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.160
His name is Lester Long.

01:08:02.202 --> 01:08:04.871
I met him over at Doc Holiday's
a couple weeks ago.

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:07.457
I know he's a truck driver.

01:08:07.499 --> 01:08:09.793
He works for a company...
Scanlon something.

01:08:11.211 --> 01:08:13.171
Scanlon Van Lines.

01:08:13.213 --> 01:08:15.340
Something like that.

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:17.216
Location?

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:19.094
I don't know.

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:21.138
So why do you think
he killed her?

01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:27.185
He thought
he was doing me a favor.

01:08:27.227 --> 01:08:29.187
A favor?

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.689
Apparently he's got
a real dim view of women.

01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:34.026
Well, hell,
who doesn't around here?

01:08:34.067 --> 01:08:36.987
Why the fuck did you
wait so long to tell us?

01:08:38.904 --> 01:08:41.575
Wait until you meet him.

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:44.745
Hey.

01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:46.537
Quit!

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.167
Where have you been? Just
trying to make an honest living.

01:08:52.544 --> 01:08:54.087
Any messages, dear?

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:55.921
Who'd wanna talk to you?

01:08:57.758 --> 01:09:00.719
There was someone calling for
that Lester Long fella though.

01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:02.386
Oh, yeah?

01:09:02.429 --> 01:09:03.639
Did they, uh,

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.390
say who it was?

01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:09.227
Said she was from the FBI.
They got women working there now?

01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:11.479
What did you tell her?

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.774
I told her there was no
Lester Long working here.

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:15.942
Mm-hmm. I did right,
didn't I, Bobby?

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.444
Mmm.

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:21.782
You sure did.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.742
Where's my sugar, darlin'?

01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:26.453

Hi. This is a warrant authorizing
a search of these premises.

01:09:46.973 --> 01:09:48.642
<i>All paid admissions...</i>

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.894
<i>will receive a free poster
of the entire team.</i>

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:54.189
<i>Folks, you're not gonna want
to miss this special team event.</i>

01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:56.817
You know,
I don't know what... what you're doing here.

01:09:56.858 --> 01:09:58.819
I told you where
you could find him.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:02.322
We called Scanlon Van Lines.
There's no Lester Long working there.

01:10:03.824 --> 01:10:05.450
Did it ever occur to you...

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:08.286
that maybe there's more
than one Scanlon Van Lines?

01:10:08.328 --> 01:10:09.830
Mm-hmm.

01:10:09.871 --> 01:10:12.332
We're investigating
all our options.

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.626
'Cause, you know,
somewhere out there,

01:10:14.668 --> 01:10:17.504
there's a big truck with "Scanlon
Van Lines" written right on the side.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:20.507
I just figured with all the police and FBI,
you might...

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:22.926
<i>He's hitting a very anemic. 126.</i>

01:10:28.849 --> 01:10:31.977

01:10:38.191 --> 01:10:41.027
Would you come in here, sir?

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.867
What? What happened here?

01:10:46.908 --> 01:10:50.162
The floorboards are coming up.

01:10:50.203 --> 01:10:53.206
Yeah, the, uh,
piece-of-shit water bed broke.

01:10:58.795 --> 01:11:01.757
That happened to me one time.

01:11:01.798 --> 01:11:03.759
What a mess.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.218
No kidding.

01:11:08.221 --> 01:11:11.558
<i>The entire lineup is going
through this entire...</i>

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:17.022
<i>Go right down the lineup. There's one
hitter out of the starting nine that has...</i>

01:11:17.063 --> 01:11:18.690
You know,

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:21.693
I don't really believe
you think I did it.

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.528
Why not?

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:27.240
Well, I'm no FBI
or anything, but...

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.035
I don't know,
you've been looking for this guy for a long time.

01:11:30.076 --> 01:11:32.120
You're probably pretty
obsessed by him by now.

01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:34.873
If you really thought I did it,
I think I could tell.

01:11:34.915 --> 01:11:39.211
I'm not obsessed.
Nor am I that easy to read.

01:11:39.252 --> 01:11:42.339
- So how long have you been with the FBI?
- None of your business.

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:48.386
Well,
it's... it's a pretty small piece of information,

01:11:48.428 --> 01:11:52.432
considering that right now you're
searching through everything I own.

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.976
Fair enough. Twelve years.

01:11:55.018 --> 01:11:56.728
Twelve years.

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.396
Wow.

01:11:58.438 --> 01:12:00.398
So that would make you what?

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.568
Very good at what I do,
and 32 years young.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:07.197
Thirty-two. That's a great age,
I would imagine.

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:13.578
Just trying to make
a little conversation.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.581
I appreciate that. I do.
But, um, it's not necessary.

01:12:16.623 --> 01:12:19.292
So why don't you go finish
watching your sporting event?

01:12:19.292 --> 01:12:20.585
Baseball.

01:12:20.627 --> 01:12:22.379
Baseball.

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.214
In here!

01:13:04.504 --> 01:13:06.089
You're up early.

01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:08.091
Yep. Any news?

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:10.093
I sent his mug shot out
last night.

01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:12.345
We'll see if anybody
recognizes him.

01:13:12.345 --> 01:13:14.472
Tell me something.

01:13:14.514 --> 01:13:17.767
Is he like you pictured?

01:13:17.809 --> 01:13:21.521
I don't know what I pictured,
but, no, he's not.

01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:24.190
Doesn't that bother you?

01:13:25.358 --> 01:13:26.860
It all bothers me.

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.330
Chow time.

01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:40.040
Not hungry.

01:13:41.207 --> 01:13:42.667
Well, I heard that,

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:44.294
but you gotta eat
something, boy.

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:47.964
Any luck finding him, Mooney?

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:51.384
No.

01:13:51.384 --> 01:13:53.178
Well, keep trying,
won't you, Mooney?

01:13:53.219 --> 01:13:55.972
Oh, hell, you know I will.

01:13:57.557 --> 01:14:01.102

01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:50.355
