( alarm blaring )

01:01.828 --> 01:02.796
( grunts )

01:03.829 --> 01:05.231
( panting )

01:09.969 --> 01:11.771
Oxygen. Oxygen!

01:11.805 --> 01:12.838
Henri: There!

01:12.872 --> 01:14.074
( grunts )

01:14.507 --> 01:15.475
( grunts )

01:16.776 --> 01:18.911
Henri,
how many do we need?

01:18.945 --> 01:20.513
We take as many
as we can carry!

01:21.080 --> 01:22.448
( panting )

01:22.481 --> 01:24.517
-( alarm blaring )
-Logan: Fuck, it's moving fast.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.490
Ring 5 is almost out.
You got to hurry the hell up!

01:31.424 --> 01:33.159
-( Henri grunts )
-Shun: Hurry!

01:34.026 --> 01:35.695
( grunting )

01:41.500 --> 01:43.103
( beeping )

01:45.805 --> 01:46.673
Oh, no.

01:48.841 --> 01:50.243
Get out of the ring!

01:51.244 --> 01:52.911
<i> -Get out of the ring!</i>
-Lana: Henri, come on!

01:52.945 --> 01:54.414
( grunts )

01:54.447 --> 01:55.715
( grunting )

01:57.850 --> 01:59.319
Shun: Let's go!
Let's go!

02:00.653 --> 02:02.155
-Shit.
-Shun: Come on!

02:03.055 --> 02:04.224
Henri: Take these!

02:05.325 --> 02:06.626
Leave it! Leave it!

02:06.659 --> 02:10.129
-We can't afford to lose one!
-Henri, the door! Run!

02:10.163 --> 02:12.465
Lana:<i> Henri, come on! Run!</i>

02:12.498 --> 02:13.766
( grunting )

02:23.008 --> 02:25.178
I'm okay.
( coughing and gasping )

02:29.882 --> 02:31.451
( grunting )

02:32.519 --> 02:34.187
Fuck you, SIREN.

02:38.724 --> 02:40.459
Baum still hasn't
come back from Ring 1.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.862
-Kate, you're not
going down there.
-We can't just leave him there.

02:42.895 --> 02:46.366
Yes, we can! It was his dumb
idea to go smash up the probe.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.469
He's the one
who gave you blood.

02:52.004 --> 02:52.872
( screams )

03:06.386 --> 03:08.788
Rey, the others will be back
with the tanks. We have to go.

03:08.821 --> 03:12.425
Wait. There's footage
from the second
expedition to Iris.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.425
Wha...

03:13.459 --> 03:14.894
-( static through speakers )
-woman:<i> Ellen.</i>

03:14.927 --> 03:15.962
<i> Ellen, where are you?</i>

03:15.995 --> 03:17.263
( Ellen screaming )

03:17.863 --> 03:18.831
<i> Ellen.</i>

03:22.935 --> 03:25.238
<i>Stop it!</i> ( screaming )

03:28.808 --> 03:29.809
woman:<i> Ellen!</i>

03:31.043 --> 03:32.378
( screams )

03:32.845 --> 03:34.247
<i> Please, help me.</i>

03:34.947 --> 03:36.449
( screaming and gasping )

03:41.621 --> 03:42.488
( sighs )

03:42.955 --> 03:43.957
<i> Ellen!</i>

03:47.226 --> 03:49.028
( breathes shakily )

03:49.061 --> 03:50.964
( stutters )
That was the same infection.

03:52.799 --> 03:53.733
That's why...

03:56.235 --> 03:58.504
That's why Protocol 47 exists.

03:59.939 --> 04:03.276
Because SIREN knew there was
hostile life near Thea.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.246
They knew and
they put us all in danger.

04:17.957 --> 04:21.327
-Lana: Where's Katie?
-She's gone to go find Baum.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.263
( Henri coughing and panting )

04:31.436 --> 04:33.306
How do we help you?
Henri!

04:33.839 --> 04:35.141
How can we help you?

04:35.174 --> 04:36.575
( panting )

04:36.608 --> 04:39.979
There may be an atropine
autoinjector in the
Medical Center.

04:40.679 --> 04:42.148
Okay.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.417
Henri:
<i> If this is a nerve agent,</i>

04:45.551 --> 04:47.320
it's the only thing
that could help me now.

04:48.554 --> 04:49.789
Okay.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.958
-I'll find it.
-Lana:<i> I'll help you.</i>

04:57.697 --> 04:58.965
( coughing )

05:01.000 --> 05:03.669
Katie:<i> Baum! Baum!</i>

05:03.702 --> 05:05.004
( panting )

05:08.307 --> 05:09.609
What the hell
are you doing?

05:11.444 --> 05:13.646
( breathes shakily )
I can't break it.

05:14.746 --> 05:16.849
<i> -I can't even make a dent.</i>
-Get up.

05:20.786 --> 05:22.021
( creaking )

05:23.722 --> 05:27.493
-Come on.
It's not safe on this thing.
-It's not safe anywhere, Katie!

05:27.526 --> 05:29.429
-The Protocol can't be stopped.
-Yeah.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.898
Well, while you were mindlessly
swinging an axe around,

05:31.931 --> 05:33.733
we actually made a plan.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.702
We have oxygen tanks.
We can use them
until we make it to Thea.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.170
( scoffs )

05:38.204 --> 05:40.340
Oxygen tanks...
( breathes heavily )

05:40.373 --> 05:42.975
SIREN designed a system
to ensure our extinction.

05:43.008 --> 05:45.645
You really think a bunch of
tanks are gonna save us?

05:47.012 --> 05:48.514
We have to try.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.818
( system bleeps )

06:00.025 --> 06:01.361
( Baum speaking German )

06:02.394 --> 06:03.663
( in English ) "Base"?

06:06.499 --> 06:08.401
-Does that mean...
-It can go back.

06:10.569 --> 06:14.173
Katie:<i> Oh, my God.
A way off the ship.</i>

06:14.206 --> 06:15.675
It can go back to Thea.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.499
( grunts )

06:40.733 --> 06:41.601
( sighs )

07:06.391 --> 07:07.460
Lana:<i> Shun!</i>

07:08.761 --> 07:09.629
I found it.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.267
-What?
-You go ahead.
I'll get more masks.

07:15.301 --> 07:16.702
We don't have time.

07:16.735 --> 07:19.071
Just get the antidote to Henri.
I'll be right behind you.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.198
( breathing rapidly )

07:58.177 --> 07:59.111
( injects )

08:02.381 --> 08:03.583
Henri: Thank you.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.490
How do we know
if it's worked?

08:11.657 --> 08:16.429
It should turn green once
the toxins have left my body.

08:16.462 --> 08:21.801
But if it doesn't,
there'll be more oxygen
for the rest of you. ( laughs )

08:24.169 --> 08:25.605
( alarm blaring )

08:30.542 --> 08:34.113
I hope you know
how much I respect you.

08:36.114 --> 08:40.720
From the beginning,
you've always valued
the lives of others,

08:41.253 --> 08:43.155
often over your own.

08:47.226 --> 08:51.230
I feel like
I've failed you all.

08:52.264 --> 08:53.132
No.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.835
No, no.

08:56.668 --> 08:58.136
You've been a captain.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.272
( door opens )

09:06.712 --> 09:08.314
Don't tell her
what happened to me.

09:12.151 --> 09:13.219
Henri, are you okay?

09:13.619 --> 09:15.220
I'm fine.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.789
I'm just tired.

09:21.126 --> 09:22.929
Baum:<i> We just need to
activate the launch sequence.</i>

09:23.428 --> 09:24.297
Okay.

09:26.265 --> 09:27.600
Okay, we have to
tell the others.

09:30.702 --> 09:32.238
God, is this thing
even stable?

09:33.105 --> 09:34.240
Wait, wait.

09:38.577 --> 09:39.645
Katie: "Weight limit"?

09:42.514 --> 09:44.149
It can't take all of us.

09:44.182 --> 09:45.450
Oh, my God.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.552
Baum:<i> Fuck's sake.</i>

09:47.586 --> 09:48.955
( crying )

09:58.364 --> 09:59.332
Let's go.

10:00.265 --> 10:01.133
What?

10:02.201 --> 10:03.935
Come on, Katie.

10:03.969 --> 10:08.273
You must know on some level
that we're not gonna make it
if we stay.

10:08.307 --> 10:12.378
If we tell the others,
we might not be the ones
leaving the<i> Origin.</i>

10:14.947 --> 10:16.215
You're mad.

10:16.248 --> 10:20.252
-We can't just
steal this thing, Baum.
-Why not?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.788
You think we're
really gonna reach a consensus?

10:25.924 --> 10:29.395
Katie, they tried
to kill both of us.

10:31.563 --> 10:33.032
<i>It's every man
for himself now.</i>

10:40.706 --> 10:42.341
I'm not leaving
anyone behind.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.213
I'm not leaving
Logan behind.

10:56.355 --> 10:57.890
Then I guess
this is goodbye.

11:03.929 --> 11:04.797
Fine.

11:07.132 --> 11:08.067
Fine.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.037
You're the one
that has to live with it.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.142
You saved Logan.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.980
There must be some part of you
that believes you're better
than this.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.953
-Abigail:
Do we tell the others?
-What good would it do?

11:27.987 --> 11:29.455
Let's just make it
to Thea.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.458
Kate, where are you?

11:33.492 --> 11:34.827
( door opens )

11:39.131 --> 11:41.901
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:43.602 --> 11:45.070
Okay.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.405
What the hell
took you guys so long?

11:50.642 --> 11:52.678
What? What is it?

11:52.711 --> 11:54.013
It's the probe.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.115
It can make it
back to Thea.

11:56.148 --> 11:58.818
-What?
-Baum:<i> It's automated
to return to base.</i>

12:00.652 --> 12:01.987
We have a way
off the<i> Origin.</i>

12:03.822 --> 12:05.458
We have a way
off this ship?

12:10.295 --> 12:11.564
Well, fuck, let's move!

12:11.597 --> 12:13.199
It only takes two of us.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.901
-Katie:<i> It's not designed
for passengers.</i>
-What?

12:17.502 --> 12:18.904
There's a weight limit.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.139
( scoffs )

12:21.540 --> 12:22.408
Wait.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.211
You knew that
and you didn't go?

12:25.877 --> 12:27.279
I was convinced otherwise.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.886
Rey:<i> Okay. We don't have long
to get back down there.</i>

12:34.919 --> 12:37.022
How are we supposed
to decide who gets on it?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.259
I don't know.

12:40.292 --> 12:43.361
We have to make
that decision together. Right?

12:43.395 --> 12:45.965
-Rey:<i> Yeah.</i>
-Okay. Well, where are
Shun and Lana?

13:03.415 --> 13:09.154
<i> I just find myself
yearning for open space,</i>

13:09.188 --> 13:11.490
<i> like the lake outside
our house growing up.</i>

13:15.360 --> 13:17.997
<i> Jumping in there with my
brother Sam on hot days.</i>

13:21.233 --> 13:22.101
<i> I don't know.</i>

14:11.550 --> 14:12.717
( recorder clicks )

14:12.750 --> 14:13.919
Lana: ( on recording )<i> Lana.</i>

14:16.755 --> 14:18.023
<i> Her name is Lana.</i>

14:19.524 --> 14:22.628
<i> There are eight others.</i>

14:24.763 --> 14:27.900
<i> Shun, Henri, Abigail,</i>

14:29.234 --> 14:31.270
<i> -Katie, Lee...</i>
-( sniffles )

14:33.906 --> 14:35.908
<i> Logan, Baum,</i>

14:36.541 --> 14:37.409
<i> Rey.</i>

14:40.946 --> 14:42.514
<i> They know I'm still here.</i>

14:45.016 --> 14:46.919
<i> I'm the only one still here.</i>

14:47.919 --> 14:49.088
( sniffles )

14:51.323 --> 14:52.424
( exhales )

14:56.195 --> 14:58.030
( footsteps approaching )

15:01.700 --> 15:02.902
Lana:<i> What are you doing?</i>

15:21.586 --> 15:23.422
( alarm blaring )

15:23.455 --> 15:25.523
Eric:<i> Come on!</i>
Venisha:<i> Open the door!</i>

15:25.557 --> 15:26.625
( Venisha screams )

15:27.959 --> 15:29.328
( grunting )

15:31.663 --> 15:33.032
No! No!

15:33.065 --> 15:34.500
( steam hissing )

15:35.700 --> 15:37.002
( groaning )

16:03.362 --> 16:04.663
( grunts )

16:10.168 --> 16:11.537
( distant metal thudding )

16:17.042 --> 16:17.942
( thudding )

16:17.976 --> 16:19.044
( gasps )

17:53.472 --> 17:54.540
( thudding )

17:58.443 --> 17:59.311
Hello?

18:07.152 --> 18:08.287
( sighs )

19:02.707 --> 19:04.409
( both screaming )

19:10.648 --> 19:11.917
( gasping )

19:17.055 --> 19:18.524
( choking )

19:27.799 --> 19:29.368
( gasping )

19:32.837 --> 19:34.439
( choking )

19:37.809 --> 19:38.944
( choking )

19:52.156 --> 19:53.592
( coughing )

20:08.773 --> 20:10.542
( gasping and coughing )

20:40.172 --> 20:41.340
Rey!

20:44.709 --> 20:46.945
Lana:<i> What the hell happened
on this ship?</i>

20:50.682 --> 20:51.617
What's your name?

20:54.786 --> 20:55.787
Lana:<i> Lana.</i>

20:59.758 --> 21:01.026
( breathing shakily )

22:47.999 --> 22:49.000
( gun cocks )

22:50.435 --> 22:51.503
( exhales )

23:06.317 --> 23:07.386
( gasps )

23:20.065 --> 23:20.932
Hello.

23:33.178 --> 23:34.579
( gasps )

23:51.529 --> 23:54.699
<i>Okay. Entry 27,
nearly a month on the</i> Origin.

23:56.067 --> 23:59.538
<i>I'm adjusting, but life
on a ship feels like...</i>

24:01.106 --> 24:02.840
<i>Well, life on a ship.</i>

24:02.874 --> 24:07.712
<i>I just find myself
yearning for open space,</i>

24:08.980 --> 24:12.050
<i>like the lake outside
our house growing up.</i>

24:12.083 --> 24:15.020
<i> Jumping in there with my
brother Sam on hot days.</i>

24:22.460 --> 24:23.528
Lana.

24:26.130 --> 24:26.998
What?

24:29.334 --> 24:31.603
Just weird not seeing you
in space pajamas.

24:39.177 --> 24:40.145
Sleep okay?

24:40.878 --> 24:41.980
Still alive.

24:56.594 --> 24:58.830
Hey, thirsty?

24:59.898 --> 25:00.765
Yeah.

25:22.153 --> 25:23.021
What?

25:44.142 --> 25:46.911
Shun: You said you ejected him
from the ship.

25:46.944 --> 25:50.048
I went back
to the compression chamber.

25:50.081 --> 25:54.418
There was another exit
on the ceiling,
a maintenance hatch.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.856
-He must have climbed out
before--
-It has to have died.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.991
-Right?
-Henri: There's no trace
of the black fluid.

26:00.024 --> 26:03.527
<i>Wherever the alien is,
it didn't expire inside of him.</i>

26:03.561 --> 26:05.764
Not finding it
doesn't prove anything--

26:05.797 --> 26:08.766
They can't survive
without a host.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.703
It looked like there'd been
a fight at the pool.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.780
Henri: You see where
it's become like a stone.

26:22.814 --> 26:24.515
What does that mean?

26:24.548 --> 26:26.685
Well, the same thing
happened to Taylor.

26:28.152 --> 26:32.690
Before he was killed,
you said Taylor showed
signs of memory loss.

26:32.723 --> 26:35.526
<i>He didn't remember his
occupation.</i>

26:35.560 --> 26:38.263
<i>This part of the brain
is linked to memory.</i>

26:39.930 --> 26:42.667
<i>I really think there could be
something in all of this.</i>

26:43.501 --> 26:45.270
The scan will give us
the answer.

26:50.141 --> 26:51.009
Okay.

26:51.676 --> 26:52.744
I think we're ready.

27:18.970 --> 27:19.838
Shit.

27:23.374 --> 27:24.776
You need another passcode.

27:33.251 --> 27:34.419
( electricity crackling )

27:35.720 --> 27:37.255
The scanner
will identify...

27:37.288 --> 27:38.455
( alarm blaring )

27:38.489 --> 27:39.691
Henri:<i> No!</i>

27:45.663 --> 27:47.332
( steam hissing )

28:31.409 --> 28:32.744
( recorder beeps )

28:33.511 --> 28:34.379
Lana.

28:37.248 --> 28:38.116
( over recording )<i> Lana.</i>

28:43.688 --> 28:44.956
Her name is Lana.

28:46.457 --> 28:49.494
There are eight others.

28:50.494 --> 28:53.732
Shun, Henri, Abigail,

28:55.266 --> 28:57.202
Katie, Lee,

28:59.770 --> 29:03.007
Logan, Baum, Rey.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.182
They know I'm still here.

29:13.684 --> 29:15.420
I'm the only one still here.

29:21.492 --> 29:22.494
Lana: What's in here?

29:49.554 --> 29:50.889
( door opens )

29:54.459 --> 29:55.493
( door closes )

30:00.498 --> 30:01.966
( breathing heavily )

30:04.468 --> 30:05.804
Something's happening.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.907
I saw something.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.247
Shun:
<i> I know that I scare you.</i>

30:27.792 --> 30:29.427
( breathing heavily )

30:36.133 --> 30:39.536
There was this time, right,
when I was a kid.

30:39.570 --> 30:42.373
<i> My brother and I were playing
baseball on our lot.</i>

30:43.774 --> 30:45.743
<i> My brother was trying
for a home run.</i>

30:45.776 --> 30:49.914
<i> One of the older boys was
a real asshole. Tripped him.</i>

30:49.947 --> 30:52.150
-( gasping )
<i> -Sprained his ankle.</i>

30:53.985 --> 30:56.588
<i> I don't wanna be the person
that I was on Earth.</i>

30:58.189 --> 30:59.590
( grunts )

30:59.623 --> 31:01.993
<i> With everything
that's happening on this ship,
it's just...</i>

31:05.095 --> 31:08.900
<i> Brings back parts of me
that I wanted to forget.</i>

31:35.927 --> 31:37.195
This ship,

31:38.929 --> 31:42.367
the infection,
the fear, all of it,

31:45.035 --> 31:48.373
<i> it makes it impossible
to trust anyone.</i>

31:51.208 --> 31:52.610
But I want to trust you.

31:58.616 --> 31:59.651
Me, too.

32:04.788 --> 32:06.190
( gunshots )

32:09.594 --> 32:10.461
( exhales )

32:14.899 --> 32:16.968
( footsteps approaching )

32:22.740 --> 32:23.608
Hey.

32:25.776 --> 32:27.211
What are you
doing in here?

32:29.914 --> 32:31.082
I don't know.

32:33.951 --> 32:36.020
I guess I'm just trying
to figure it all out.

32:41.325 --> 32:44.362
I keep coming back,
but I never get
any new answers.

32:47.831 --> 32:49.233
<i>He's not in there anymore.</i>

32:52.336 --> 32:54.639
I know you all hate me
for opening that door.

32:58.308 --> 33:00.144
I just didn't
want him to die.

33:08.552 --> 33:11.456
I don't hate you.

33:14.758 --> 33:17.962
Lana:<i> I keep seeing images.</i>

33:17.995 --> 33:21.466
I think they're her images.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.136
I can't stop them.

33:27.905 --> 33:29.207
( recorder clatters )

33:37.848 --> 33:39.283
( clicking )

34:04.341 --> 34:05.710
-You want to read to me?
-You wanna have that drink?

34:06.778 --> 34:07.645
You're pretty.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.264
( screams )

34:29.133 --> 34:31.069
( breathing heavily )

34:33.838 --> 34:35.440
( breathing shakily )

34:44.882 --> 34:45.750
Shun:<i> You all right?</i>

34:49.353 --> 34:50.221
Yeah.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.227
You're not.

34:59.796 --> 35:01.165
( sighs )

35:04.035 --> 35:05.103
Have you ever

35:08.071 --> 35:09.607
thought about dying?

35:14.411 --> 35:16.280
You mean, like, killing myself?

35:16.313 --> 35:21.586
No, no. I mean, the fact that
you're going to die.

35:23.520 --> 35:27.525
That you can be
talking, working,

35:27.558 --> 35:30.294
and then one day,

35:31.262 --> 35:34.198
you're not.
One day, you're just gone.

35:35.265 --> 35:37.634
<i>I spent a lot
of my time on Earth</i>

35:37.668 --> 35:40.871
<i>thinking that my life
was the most important thing.</i>

35:40.905 --> 35:46.544
When my brother died,
I realized that some things
are worse than dying.

35:49.846 --> 35:51.382
Like losing someone you love.

35:58.555 --> 36:01.692
But how do you
cope with that?

36:03.260 --> 36:05.429
How do you keep going,

36:06.463 --> 36:09.500
knowing you
and everyone you know

36:10.434 --> 36:12.637
is just going to end?

36:20.544 --> 36:22.313
I think that's what
makes us human.

36:27.984 --> 36:29.520
<i>We lost a passenger today.</i>

36:32.556 --> 36:35.593
<i>I know not
everyone was expected
to make it to the other end,</i>

36:38.362 --> 36:39.430
<i> but it's a blow.</i>

36:40.264 --> 36:41.499
<i> Every time.</i>

36:48.239 --> 36:49.740
( tape rewinds )

36:49.774 --> 36:52.276
<i> It's a blow. Every time.</i>

37:00.984 --> 37:02.219
( recorder beeps )

37:02.252 --> 37:06.757
There are sensations
I don't understand.

37:12.062 --> 37:12.997
What am I?

37:22.940 --> 37:23.874
( screaming )

37:24.875 --> 37:25.743
Shun!

37:27.211 --> 37:30.214
-I can't do this.
-Yes, you can.

37:30.247 --> 37:32.082
You don't know me.

37:32.116 --> 37:33.950
Tell me about
where you grew up.

37:33.984 --> 37:35.519
<i> What was the house like?</i>

37:36.253 --> 37:38.121
<i> Were you happy?</i>

37:38.155 --> 37:39.924
( stammering )

37:39.957 --> 37:41.258
My house...

37:41.292 --> 37:43.427
<i> Like the lake outside
our house growing up.</i>

37:44.428 --> 37:47.664
It was by a lake.

37:47.698 --> 37:52.069
On hot days,
me and my brother
would jump in.

37:52.102 --> 37:54.638
<i> ...jumping in there with my
brother Sam on hot days.</i>

37:54.672 --> 37:58.408
I didn't know
you had a brother.
What was his name?

37:58.442 --> 38:01.412
( breathing heavily ) Sam.

38:20.764 --> 38:21.966
You saved my life.

39:31.768 --> 39:33.804
You're the only person
I can trust here.

39:35.305 --> 39:36.674
I've got the data, Logan.

39:40.744 --> 39:42.580
<i> We can find out
who's infected.</i>

39:44.581 --> 39:46.784
I just need you
to wake up and help me.

40:00.964 --> 40:01.899
Has he woken up yet?

40:05.535 --> 40:07.071
Were you talking to him?

40:07.938 --> 40:08.806
Not really.

40:10.374 --> 40:15.746
Lee, I heard you say something
about an infection.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.549
It's between us.

40:20.617 --> 40:22.920
If there's something
that you know,

40:22.953 --> 40:26.791
something that could help us,
you have to tell me.

40:28.559 --> 40:30.795
I can protect you.
I promise.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.002
You don't have your gun.

40:40.704 --> 40:41.572
What?

40:45.309 --> 40:46.610
You just always carry it.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.584
Where'd you learn
to use a gun, Lana?

40:53.617 --> 40:56.187
<i> Did someone teach you
or was it part of your job?</i>

40:57.121 --> 40:58.722
Why are you
asking me this?

41:00.457 --> 41:01.592
I just wondered.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.895
Where did you learn, Lana?

41:12.869 --> 41:14.505
( screaming )

41:21.077 --> 41:22.179
( screaming )

41:30.988 --> 41:31.956
( sighs )

41:45.669 --> 41:46.737
You want to read to me?

41:55.412 --> 41:56.547
( gasping )

41:59.449 --> 42:01.685
Ruby. ( breathing shakily )

43:42.585 --> 43:43.954
Lana:<i> Rey!</i>

43:46.923 --> 43:49.226
Lana:<i> What the hell happened
on this ship?</i>

43:52.695 --> 43:54.231
Shun:<i> What's your name?</i>

43:56.200 --> 43:57.067
Lana:<i> Lana.</i>

43:58.167 --> 43:59.036
<i> Lana.</i>

44:04.841 --> 44:05.943
Ruby:<i> You're pretty.</i>

44:29.866 --> 44:31.735
( knocking on door )

44:41.578 --> 44:42.446
It's open.

44:46.383 --> 44:47.251
I'm sorry.

44:49.820 --> 44:51.088
I didn't want to be alone.

45:33.496 --> 45:35.132
( sobbing )

45:49.245 --> 45:50.914
( alarm blaring )

45:55.352 --> 45:56.453
What the hell is that?

46:00.757 --> 46:01.825
Shun.

46:04.561 --> 46:05.795
Shun.

46:05.829 --> 46:07.964
You and Shun, you're kind of
like our leaders, right?

46:07.998 --> 46:09.933
I think that's what
makes us human.

46:11.534 --> 46:12.402
Shun.

46:24.347 --> 46:25.482
( injects )

46:27.684 --> 46:29.019
You've been a captain.

46:32.789 --> 46:34.291
Don't tell her
what happened to me.

46:38.395 --> 46:39.529
Henri, are you okay?

46:39.562 --> 46:42.432
Henri:<i> I'm fine.
I'm just tired.</i>

46:44.401 --> 46:46.003
( Rey grunting )

46:54.978 --> 46:56.380
( alarm blaring )

47:45.095 --> 47:46.230
Lana: ( over recording )<i> Lana.</i>

47:48.799 --> 47:50.133
<i> Her name is Lana.</i>

47:53.603 --> 47:56.607
<i> There are eight others.</i>

48:01.944 --> 48:05.148
<i> Shun, Henri, Abigail,</i>

48:09.553 --> 48:11.321
<i> Katie, Lee,</i>

48:14.391 --> 48:17.394
<i> Logan, Baum, Rey.</i>

48:25.668 --> 48:26.970
<i> They know I'm still here.</i>

48:29.805 --> 48:31.375
<i> I'm the only one still here.</i>

48:32.676 --> 48:33.543
( sniffles )

48:35.812 --> 48:36.680
( exhales )

48:42.752 --> 48:44.288
( footsteps approaching )

48:46.022 --> 48:47.257
Lana:<i> What are you doing?</i>

49:05.041 --> 49:06.576
( both grunting )

49:30.333 --> 49:31.834
( grunts )

49:31.868 --> 49:34.705
Abigail:<i> Shun, Lana...
Come on.</i>

49:35.738 --> 49:36.840
<i> Shun.</i>

49:36.873 --> 49:38.208
( Henri wincing )

49:38.774 --> 49:39.643
<i> Shun?</i>

49:40.977 --> 49:42.411
Hello?

49:42.445 --> 49:45.448
Where are you guys?
The gas is nearly
at the crew deck.

49:45.482 --> 49:47.384
We can't do this
without Shun and Lana.

49:47.417 --> 49:51.088
We have to, or none of us
will get on that thing.

49:54.490 --> 49:55.625
( both grunting )

50:03.600 --> 50:06.036
How are we supposed to choose
who gets to live?

50:06.836 --> 50:07.704
We can't.

50:11.842 --> 50:13.810
-We can't, right?
-Fuck's sake.

50:13.843 --> 50:15.178
-Abigail: Baum.
-What?

50:17.180 --> 50:19.082
I'm saying it
'cause he's right.

50:20.083 --> 50:21.318
It's impossible.

50:22.618 --> 50:25.789
Yeah. Impossible.

50:30.126 --> 50:31.595
( both grunting )

50:41.638 --> 50:43.206
-( bones cracking )
-( Shun screaming )

50:50.680 --> 50:52.249
( both panting )

51:09.933 --> 51:11.334
All this time, it was you.

51:14.604 --> 51:16.173
I'm not what you think.

51:17.207 --> 51:18.608
You're not human.

51:25.615 --> 51:27.084
( breathing shakily )

51:39.395 --> 51:40.330
Take it.

51:51.974 --> 51:53.643
There are some things
worse than dying.

52:03.586 --> 52:04.454
( sniffles )

52:05.121 --> 52:06.656
( panting )

52:09.426 --> 52:10.293
( grunts )

52:13.896 --> 52:17.968
Henri: If any one of us
has the chance
to leave the<i> Origin,</i>

52:18.001 --> 52:19.402
we shouldn't waste it.

52:41.190 --> 52:42.626
Shun, Lana,

52:44.660 --> 52:46.596
<i> if you've heard
any of my messages,</i>

52:48.398 --> 52:51.168
<i> none of us are taking
the probe off the ship.</i>

52:52.402 --> 52:53.837
So, if you two want to go,

52:56.239 --> 52:57.541
maybe we'll see you on Thea.

53:55.965 --> 53:57.367
( hissing )

54:00.437 --> 54:04.007
We've got the oxygen.
That means
we still have a chance.

54:06.376 --> 54:07.677
Logan:<i> Survived this far.</i>

54:10.613 --> 54:11.481
Right?

55:00.130 --> 55:01.831
Logan:<i> Let's do this.</i>

55:18.881 --> 55:19.749
( groans )

55:52.882 --> 55:54.050
( gasps )

56:13.936 --> 56:15.405
( alarms blaring )

56:17.506 --> 56:19.376
( alarm beeping )

56:22.077 --> 56:22.946
Logan: What the fuck is that?

56:24.247 --> 56:25.648
Something's happening.

56:25.682 --> 56:26.716
( beeps )

56:34.056 --> 56:35.125
"Threat level, zero"?

56:38.193 --> 56:40.697
Rey: "Protocol 47 deactivated"?

56:40.730 --> 56:41.831
What?

56:45.702 --> 56:48.438
Baum: Look,
it's clearing!

56:49.972 --> 56:53.276
-Logan: What's happened, Rey?
-The gas isn't being
released anymore.

56:53.309 --> 56:56.713
Protocol 47, it stopped.

56:56.746 --> 56:58.615
Logan: What does that mean?
What's happening?

57:00.149 --> 57:02.786
You said that would only happen
if the parasite was dead.

57:11.528 --> 57:13.830
Shun or Lana...

57:17.967 --> 57:19.068
Oh, my God.

57:20.203 --> 57:21.571
No fucking way.

57:22.371 --> 57:23.673
( beeping )

57:32.048 --> 57:33.683
Rey:
<i>We're going to land...</i>

57:34.316 --> 57:35.652
We're gonna land on Thea.

57:45.394 --> 57:46.830
( whooping )

57:46.863 --> 57:50.833
Logan: Fuck, yeah, baby!
We're going to Thea! Yeah!

57:50.867 --> 57:51.968
( all laughing )
