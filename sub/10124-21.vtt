WEBVTT

00:08.667 --> 00:10.000
O.K., GUYS.
YEARBOOK TIME.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.467
LOOKING BACK
ON YOUR FIRST YEAR HERE,

00:12.467 --> 00:14.734
WHAT'S YOUR GREATEST
ACCOMPLISHMENT AND WHY?

00:14.734 --> 00:17.233
LET'S SEE. I MEAN,
THERE'S SO MANY.

00:17.233 --> 00:19.233
IT'S HARD TO PICK
JUST ONE.

00:19.233 --> 00:20.934
THERE WAS
THE TIME WE--

00:20.934 --> 00:22.000
NO, THAT WASN'T US.

00:23.767 --> 00:25.367
WHAT ABOUT
WHEN WE--

00:25.367 --> 00:27.500
ALSO NOT US.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.200
YOU GUYS ARE THE TWO MOST
PATHETIC STUDENTS IN SCHOOL.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.300
THAT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.800
SHE'S RIGHT.
THE YEAR'S ALMOST OVER,

00:36.800 --> 00:38.367
AND I HAVEN'T MADE
A NAME FOR MYSELF.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.133
YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT
THAT IS?

00:40.133 --> 00:41.300
YOUR OWN?

00:41.300 --> 00:43.734
NO. WHY SHOULD I
TAKE THE FALL?

00:43.734 --> 00:45.767
I BLAME...

00:45.767 --> 00:47.834
THE JOCKS!

00:47.834 --> 00:49.200
WHY?

00:49.200 --> 00:50.800
THEY WEAR THOSE
STUPID JACKETS

00:50.800 --> 00:52.567
AND GET ALL THE GIRLS.

00:52.567 --> 00:54.100
WHAT CHANCE DO I HAVE?

00:54.100 --> 00:55.800
WHOA.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.000
MAJOR GROWTH SPURT.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.066
TOO HEAVY.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.300
PLEASE DON'T.
PLEASE DON'T.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.133
I HAD A FAT,
HEAVY BREAKFAST.

01:03.133 --> 01:04.300
WE'VE GOT AN OPENING

01:04.300 --> 01:06.400
IN THE SUPERCONFETTI
WEIGHT DIVISION

01:06.400 --> 01:08.600
ON THE WRESTLING TEAM.
SAVAGE?

01:10.100 --> 01:11.500
PERFECT.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.767
CONGRATULATIONS, KID.
YOU'RE ON THE WRESTLING
TEAM.

01:13.767 --> 01:16.734
YEAH. LIKE THERE'S
A CHANCE IN THE UNIVERSE

01:16.734 --> 01:20.500
I'D EVER WANT TO BE ON
YOUR STUPID WRESTLING TEAM.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.734
HERE'S YOUR JACKET.
OOH.

01:24.467 --> 01:26.000
LOOK, SHAWN,
MY JACKET.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.367
HERE'S YOUR UNIFORM.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.900
UNIFORM? THIS IS LIKE
CHRISTMAS, YOU KNOW?

01:31.500 --> 01:32.500
HERE'S YOUR CANDY.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.767
CANDY?

01:36.133 --> 01:37.500
HI. I'M CANDY.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.567
SWEET.

01:43.700 --> 01:46.000
[CHOKING SOUNDS]
GET OFF ME!

01:46.000 --> 01:48.667
ERIC, PUT CORY DOWN.

01:48.667 --> 01:52.800
I CAN'T.
HE'S GOT MY WINDPIPE
IN A DEATH GRIP.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.600
CORY, LET YOUR BROTHER
BREATHE.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.400
AAH.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.033
REMEMBER, PAL...

01:59.033 --> 02:01.000
I KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.200
AMY, WHEN
THE EXTERMINATORS
WERE HERE SPRAYING,

02:04.200 --> 02:06.100
DID WE LEAVE
CORY'S WINDOW OPEN?

02:06.100 --> 02:08.467
ERIC, WHY'S CORY
SO WOUND UP?

02:08.467 --> 02:10.567
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M BRUSHING
MY TEETH,

02:10.567 --> 02:13.000
LITTLE SQUIRT
BULL-RUSHES ME
FROM BEHIND.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
IT'S, UH, ALL HERE
IN THIS PERMISSION SLIP.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.300
PERMISSION
SLIP?
SIGN IT, PLEASE.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.734
AMY!

02:19.734 --> 02:22.200
LITTLE CORY MADE
THE WRESTLING TEAM.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.300
ALL RIGHT!
GET YOUR OLD MAN
A PEN.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.033
NOW, ALAN, WE SHOULD
DISCUSS THIS.

02:27.033 --> 02:28.367
WRESTLING IS DANGEROUS.

02:28.367 --> 02:30.467
IF HE WERE SIGNING
UP FOR BALLET,

02:30.467 --> 02:31.834
THAT MIGHT BE
DANGEROUS.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.200
WHERE DO I SIGN?

02:33.200 --> 02:34.767
WAIT, DAD.
I KNOW THESE
WRESTLERS.

02:34.767 --> 02:37.000
THEY'RE LIKE
PSYCHOTIC
CAGED ANIMALS

02:37.000 --> 02:38.500
WAITING TO
TAKE OUT THEIR
AGGRESSIONS

02:38.500 --> 02:40.667
ON LITTLE RUNTS
LIKE CORY.
USE MY PEN.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.967
A TOAST TO CORY MATTHEWS,

02:45.967 --> 02:48.200
THE NEWEST MEMBER OF
THE JOHN ADAMS HIGH
WRESTLING TEAM.

02:48.200 --> 02:52.233
CHUG! CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!

02:55.567 --> 02:57.200
AHH!
AHH!
AHH!

02:58.867 --> 03:00.600
WHAT? AM I DRIBBLING?

03:00.600 --> 03:01.867
NO, MATTHEWS.

03:01.867 --> 03:03.467
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO
WITH THE CAN?

03:05.200 --> 03:07.367
RECYCLE, OF COURSE.

03:07.367 --> 03:08.734
NO, CRUSH IT.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.734
LIKE THIS.

03:10.734 --> 03:11.667
RRR!

03:11.667 --> 03:12.600
RRR!
RRR!

03:16.767 --> 03:18.300
IT'S ALL BONE UP HERE.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.300
YOU CAN'T DAMAGE
ANYTHING.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.100
[BREATHING HARD]

03:22.100 --> 03:23.100
RRR!

03:27.900 --> 03:29.934
OH, BOY.
EXCUSE ME.

03:29.934 --> 03:32.600
I'M JUST GOING
TO GO VISIT
THE WHITE LIGHTS.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.000
HEY. HEY, YOU O.K.?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.100
YES, PAT...

03:38.100 --> 03:41.800
BUT I'D LIKE
TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.233
CORY.

03:43.233 --> 03:44.600
WHAT?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.500
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

03:46.500 --> 03:48.200
SO I'LL FINALLY
HAVE COOL STUFF

03:48.200 --> 03:49.834
TO PUT IN THE YEARBOOK,

03:49.834 --> 03:53.200
AND THIS JACKET
IS A BABE MAGNET.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.767
MATTHEWS, LOOK.
TWO CANS.

03:55.767 --> 03:56.900
RRR!

03:59.300 --> 04:01.867
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE SHE RELOADS.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.734
AND SO IT WAS NIXON

04:05.734 --> 04:08.367
WHO BECAME THE FIRST
AMERICAN PRESIDENT

04:08.367 --> 04:11.200
TO TRAVEL TO CHINA,
THEREBY--

04:11.200 --> 04:14.100
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

04:14.100 --> 04:16.600
YOU WERE ON ME
ABOUT CUTTING CLASS,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.200
SO THIS IS
THE ONLY TIME

04:18.200 --> 04:21.000
THE MASSEUSE
COULD DO ME.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.367
SO, NIXON, CHINA--
I'M ALL EARS.

04:23.367 --> 04:26.567
I HAVE A REALLY
BAD KNOT RIGHT HERE.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.200
ALL RIGHT,
THAT DOES IT.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.600
OUT.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.200
YOU GOING
TO CRACK MY BACK?

04:33.200 --> 04:36.000
DON'T TEMPT ME.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.600
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF YOUR ANTICS.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.300
THIS SCHOOL WAS MEANT
FOR EDUCATION,

04:42.300 --> 04:44.300
NOT FOR YOUR OWN
PERSONAL PLEASURES.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.500
I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.200
WE ARE BACK
FROM THE AIRPORT, GRIFF.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.800
WE GOT YOUR LOBSTERS.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.000
LOBSTERS?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.300
FLOWN IN FRESH
FROM MAINE.

04:55.867 --> 04:58.400
I COULD EAT MINE
RIGHT NOW.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.066
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE,
FRANKIE.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.033
I SAID WHAT I SAID.

05:02.033 --> 05:05.133
MR. FEENY,
CARE TO JOIN US
FOR A LATE LUNCH?

05:05.133 --> 05:07.500
THERE'S A 4-POUNDER
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.300
GO TO MY OFFICE
AND WAIT FOR ME.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.800
JUST
MR. HAWKINS.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.734
WHERE GRIFF GOES,
WE GO.

05:13.734 --> 05:17.467
GENTLEMEN,
DON'T YOU HAVE LIVES
OF YOUR OWN?

05:18.867 --> 05:21.033
NO, SIR.

05:21.033 --> 05:23.500
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN MR. HAWKINS
ISN'T AROUND

05:23.500 --> 05:26.600
TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO IF, SAY,
HE'S EXPELLED?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.600
LIKE THAT
COULD EVER HAPPEN.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.834
IT COULD HAPPEN.

05:29.834 --> 05:32.667
WHAT? THEN I'D HAVE
TO GET MY OWN LIFE.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.200
I'D CONSIDER IT.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.567
BUT ALL THE GOOD LIVES
ARE TAKEN.

05:37.567 --> 05:40.233
I'LL SEE YOU
AFTER CLASS.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.834
WE'RE ALL ALONE, FRANKIE.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.233
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

05:45.233 --> 05:46.567
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU,

05:46.567 --> 05:49.867
BUT I'M GOING
TO GET SOME BUTTER.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.100
CORY.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.000
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET ME

05:55.000 --> 05:56.900
TO FINISH THESE
YEARBOOK WRITE-UPS.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.300
TOPANGA, RELAX.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.100
HERE. HERE'S EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW

06:01.100 --> 06:02.300
ABOUT CORY--

06:02.300 --> 06:03.700
"THE CORY"--

06:03.700 --> 06:04.600
MATTHEWS.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.767
I KNOW. THE NICKNAME
NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.567
"GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT--

06:10.567 --> 06:12.300
"MAKING THE WRESTLING TEAM.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.867
"FONDEST MEMORY--

06:13.867 --> 06:15.734

06:19.133 --> 06:21.900
RRR!

06:21.900 --> 06:23.734
GOOD BOY.

06:23.734 --> 06:24.700
GOODBYE.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.367
WANT TO ASK ME
MORE QUESTIONS
FOR THE YEARBOOK?

06:29.367 --> 06:31.300
YEAH. WHERE DO
YOU THINK CORY'S

06:31.300 --> 06:33.900
GOING TO END UP
IN 10 YEARS?

06:33.900 --> 06:35.500
YOU MEAN ME,
DON'T YOU?

06:35.500 --> 06:36.967
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.400
NO. YOU SAID CORY.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.367
I DID NOT.

06:39.367 --> 06:40.600
YOU LIKE HIM.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.200
YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,
I'LL KILL YOU.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.834
YOU LIKE HIM A LOT.

06:45.834 --> 06:48.100
RRR!
RRR!
RRR!

06:49.600 --> 06:51.500
LAY OFF.
LET HIM GO.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.667
RRR.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.100
RRR.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.200
WHICH ONE OF THESE GOONS
THREW THE FIRST PUNCH?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.700
THIS GOON.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.000
NO, SERIOUSLY.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I DID.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.600
I'M ON THE WRESTLING TEAM,

07:04.600 --> 07:06.500
AND WE'RE JUST HORSING AROUND.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.867
THAT'S WHAT JOCKS DO,

07:07.867 --> 07:09.200
AND I AM A JOCK.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.300
OH, MAN, I HOPE YOU'RE
NOT A RARE BLOOD TYPE.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.100
MR. TURNER...

07:17.100 --> 07:18.233
SIDEBAR.

07:18.233 --> 07:21.500
I'M THE ONLY ONE
IN MY WEIGHT CLASS.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.000
I NEVER HAVE
TO FIGHT.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.600
WHAT CAN GO WRONG?

07:24.600 --> 07:25.500
MATTHEWS...

07:25.500 --> 07:27.100
YOU GOT TO FIGHT.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.700
AB-NEGATIVE.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.100
UNIVERSAL
RECIPIENT.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.800
THAT SHOULD COME
IN HANDY.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.400
YOU GOT TO
EARN THIS JACKET.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.834
SOMEBODY JUST SIGNED UP
IN YOUR WEIGHT CLASS.

07:44.767 --> 07:48.600
WHAT EXACTLY
IS THE RANGE
IN MY WEIGHT CLASS?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.100
NO, MATTHEWS,
NOT FRANKIE,

07:50.100 --> 07:52.200
BUT SOMEONE
WHO'S LOOKING

07:52.200 --> 07:54.233
TO MAKE A NAME
FOR HIMSELF,

07:54.233 --> 07:55.734
BE HIS OWN PERSON,

07:55.734 --> 07:57.100
CARVE HIS OWN NICHE.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.066
AND I'M GOING
TO CARVE ME A NICHE

08:00.066 --> 08:02.700
RIGHT IN YOUR STINKING HEAD.
NICE JACKET. HEE HEE HEE.

08:10.934 --> 08:13.000
RRR!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.734
THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

08:17.467 --> 08:18.767
YOU KNOW...

08:18.767 --> 08:20.300
I TRIED LIFTING WEIGHTS.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.800
MAN, ARE THEY HEAVY.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.734
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
TAKING JOEY ON?

08:25.734 --> 08:26.900
ABSOLUTELY.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.700
'CAUSE HE'S NOT
TAKING ME SERIOUSLY.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.734
I'LL BET HE'S NOT EVEN
TRAINING.

08:31.734 --> 08:34.500
HEY, MATTHEWS.
COME TO WATCH
THE ENEMY TRAIN?

08:36.400 --> 08:39.700
WHY AM I ALWAYS WRONG
ABOUT EVERYTHING?

08:39.700 --> 08:42.734
MAYBE THIS IS
A CLOSED DOOR SESSION.

08:42.734 --> 08:45.300
MAYBE I'LL JUST WHIP
YOUR SORRY ELFIN
DUCK FACE NOW.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.033
JOEY, JOEY.

08:48.033 --> 08:50.300
YOUR OPPONENT IS PLAYING
MIND GAMES WITH YOU.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.467
IGNORE, AND FOCUS
ON THE TASK AT HAND--

08:53.467 --> 08:55.700
OUR TRAINING.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.000
LESSON ONE--BALANCE.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.300
THIS IS A WRESTLING
TECHNIQUE I PICKED UP

09:03.300 --> 09:05.367
WHILE I WAS TOURING JAPAN
LAST SUMMER.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.900
IT'S CALLED
"PUSH THE WRESTLER
OUT OF THE RING."

09:17.567 --> 09:19.033
SHAWN.

09:19.033 --> 09:21.300
THERE'S A LITTLE VOICE
INSIDE MY HEAD SAYING,

09:21.300 --> 09:22.700
"DO NOT FEAR JOEY."

09:25.400 --> 09:27.867
A LITTLE VOICE SAYING,

09:27.867 --> 09:29.667
"I CAN BEAT JOEY."

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
UHH!

09:35.400 --> 09:38.033
OHH...

09:40.767 --> 09:42.300
AND ANOTHER VOICE SAYING,

09:42.300 --> 09:45.200
"OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!"

09:45.200 --> 09:46.734
[BLENDER RUNS]

09:46.734 --> 09:50.400
WHOA! IT'S MY SON
CORY "THE CORY."

09:50.400 --> 09:53.133
HEY. READY FOR YOUR
BIG WRESTLING MATCH?

09:53.133 --> 09:56.233
ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO LET HIM
GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

09:56.233 --> 09:58.300
I'M NOT A LITTLE BOY
ANYMORE.
