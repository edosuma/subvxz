Americans? Brits? Italians?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.225
It doesn't even say.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.566
Well, I think we can assume
they're friendly, Mr. Loomis.

to be a suggestion, does it?

02:31.184 --> 02:33.118

- You can tell that from here?

03:29.976 --> 03:32.410
The krauts use white on their
lifeboats. The Brits use red.

Don't they teach you that

that's sinking slow enough
to get a few lifeboats off,

11:52.510 --> 11:55.035
but the submarine
only fires one torpedo.

that's not textbook tactics.

until the target is sunk.

a <i>big</i> ocean, didn't it?

34:16.684 --> 34:19.414
We are running out of places
to hide.

34:19.487 --> 34:21.648
[Sonar pinging]

34:29.831 --> 34:35.463
Crow, give me one sounding
for depth on <i>their</i> ping.

34:35.536 --> 34:37.732
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.

34:37.806 --> 34:39.068
- [Ping]
- 3...

34:39.139 --> 34:41.608
- [Ping]
- 2...

34:41.676 --> 34:42.904
- [Ping]
- 1.

34:42.976 --> 34:46.435
[Clicks, sonar pings]

34:46.514 --> 34:48.447
Not much there, sir.

34:48.516 --> 34:50.746
Bring in the soundheads.
Let's use it all.

34:50.819 --> 34:52.150
[Knob clicking, switch clicks]

35:05.667 --> 35:07.100
[Rumbling]

35:07.168 --> 35:09.136
Aah!

35:16.277 --> 35:18.040
What was that?

35:18.113 --> 35:19.546
[Panting] Don't ask me.

35:19.614 --> 35:21.377
Ask him.

35:21.449 --> 35:23.474
- What was that?
- Miss Page, once again,

35:23.551 --> 35:25.314
I must remind you,
do not leave your station.

35:25.386 --> 35:26.717
What did we hit just now?!

35:27.956 --> 35:29.389
The bottom.

35:30.458 --> 35:32.483
Well, how long can we afford
to stay down here?

35:32.560 --> 35:34.790
I thought you said we needed
to surface to take on...

35:34.863 --> 35:36.524
BRICE ON P.A.:
Attention all hands...

35:36.598 --> 35:39.362
off-duty personnel are expected
to be in the racks.

35:39.434 --> 35:41.925
And the smoking lamp is out.

35:42.003 --> 35:44.301
[Electricity crackles]

35:44.372 --> 35:46.306
I guess we're gonna find out.

35:49.544 --> 35:53.173
[Indistinct conversations]

35:56.951 --> 35:58.942
[Alarm buzzer sounds]

36:08.897 --> 36:11.730
[Buzzer continues]

36:20.975 --> 36:22.738
[Clicks, buzzer stops]

36:22.810 --> 36:24.471
[Sighs]

36:27.849 --> 36:29.840
[Rumbling]

36:39.594 --> 36:42.461
Seaweed.

36:42.530 --> 36:45.021
Might be a fishing net.

36:45.099 --> 36:48.762
It's caught up,
slaps against the hull.

36:50.205 --> 36:53.038
You hear... you hear a lot
of strange things at depth.

36:53.107 --> 36:55.268
I mean, I can't even
identify 'em all.

36:58.313 --> 36:59.837
So...

37:01.849 --> 37:04.409
What am I gonna do with you?

37:04.485 --> 37:06.749
I'm sorry.

37:06.821 --> 37:09.722
I regret not telling you
about Schillings...

37:09.791 --> 37:12.726
because... well,
I... I should have realized

37:12.794 --> 37:15.922
that a submarine isn't
a good place to keep secrets.

37:19.734 --> 37:21.429
Is it?

37:23.304 --> 37:27.035
We'd been stalking
a German sub tender for a while.

37:27.108 --> 37:28.700
We finally got our shot in,

37:28.776 --> 37:30.539
cracked its back
with one torpedo.

37:30.612 --> 37:34.173
We went topside to survey the
damage, and the ship was gone.

37:34.249 --> 37:36.308
But there's a lot of debris
in the water,

37:36.384 --> 37:39.114
and Captain Winters decides
to go down and haul some in.

37:39.187 --> 37:40.950
It was the middle
of the Atlantic.

37:41.022 --> 37:42.455
He wants to do
some souvenir hunting,

37:42.523 --> 37:45.083
get something for his... I don't
know... his mantle piece.

37:45.159 --> 37:48.492
I try to talk him out of it,
and... but he's al...

37:50.531 --> 37:53.796
Anyway, he... the boat hit
an underwater obstruction,

37:53.868 --> 37:55.301
and he fell... he hit his head.

37:55.370 --> 37:58.032
And he was... he went under
before we could get to him.

38:03.077 --> 38:04.635
I heard you were asking.

38:04.712 --> 38:06.339
So he drowned.

38:08.182 --> 38:10.776
We already radioed Connecticut
with news of the accident.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.713
[Sighs]

38:14.789 --> 38:16.051
[Chuckles]

38:16.124 --> 38:19.218
You know, we really,
really got off

38:19.294 --> 38:21.854
on the wrong foot, and I...

38:21.963 --> 38:24.955
So j-just feel free to move
about the forward sections of...

38:25.033 --> 38:27.160

38:38.880 --> 38:42.008
Sorry, sir...
humidity builds up,

38:42.083 --> 38:44.210
drips out the power bus.

38:44.285 --> 38:46.014
I'll get right on it.

38:48.022 --> 38:51.549
So... would you reconsider
England...

38:51.626 --> 38:53.150
finding a port there?

38:53.227 --> 38:55.388
I'm sorry.

39:02.503 --> 39:03.765
[Grunts]

39:03.838 --> 39:06.170
Sorry for what?

39:09.544 --> 39:13.378
Uh, she was...
asking about Winters.

39:14.716 --> 39:16.707
What did you tell her?

39:18.786 --> 39:20.617
The story.

39:25.060 --> 39:27.995
Well, it's coming up
astern, but...

39:32.934 --> 39:34.526
[Rumbling]

39:34.602 --> 39:36.695
I don't know what that is.

Hooks!
They're using their hooks!

40:12.640 --> 40:14.801
[Clanking]

40:16.711 --> 40:18.406
Mr. Loomis, what do we do?

40:18.480 --> 40:20.914
What are your orders,
Mr. Brice?

40:24.819 --> 40:26.309
Mr. Loomis,
the helm is waiting!

40:26.387 --> 40:29.322
The men are waiting
for your orders, Mr. Brice!

40:39.667 --> 40:40.531
Aah!

40:44.038 --> 40:46.029
Get out! Get out!

40:46.107 --> 40:48.837
Everybody, out!
Move it out!

40:48.910 --> 40:50.434
[Indistinct shouting]

40:50.512 --> 40:53.310
Go! Go! Go!
Everybody, out!

40:53.381 --> 40:54.109
- Come on!
- Get out!

40:54.182 --> 40:56.844
[Echoing]
Get out! Get out!

40:59.754 --> 41:01.619
Get down there, Harry!
Move!

[Creaks]

41:06.628 --> 41:08.721
[Clicking]

41:08.796 --> 41:10.195
Get out.

41:10.265 --> 41:13.701
O'Dell, make sure
everybody's out!

41:13.768 --> 41:16.896
- Everybody's out, sir!
- Then close the goddamn hatch!

41:16.971 --> 41:19.565
- Blow safety!
- Blow safety!

41:19.641 --> 41:21.006
What heading, sir?!

41:21.075 --> 41:23.475
Any goddamn heading!
Just get us out of here!

41:26.214 --> 41:28.842
[Whirring, engines roar]

41:46.000 --> 41:47.524
[Poles squeak]

41:49.637 --> 41:52.435
[Shivering]

42:00.081 --> 42:02.345
You'll do better
at the board of inquiry.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.292
[Clicking, hatch opens]

42:25.139 --> 42:27.369
[Clicking, whirring]

42:27.441 --> 42:29.602
We're sloughing oil,
and it's bad.

42:29.677 --> 42:31.110
I don't know exactly
where it is,

42:31.178 --> 42:34.170
but it's somewhere between the
pressure hull and the sea hull.

42:34.248 --> 42:36.842
And if it's leaking here
or here,

42:36.918 --> 42:39.079
then it's dumping oil
under the main ballast,

42:39.153 --> 42:41.246
which means that every time
we surface or dive...

42:41.322 --> 42:42.880
We leave an oil slick.

42:42.957 --> 42:45.152
Well, that's how...
that's how he's been riding us.

42:45.226 --> 42:47.217
This boat <i>is</i> cursed.

42:51.566 --> 42:54.160
Figure of speech.

42:54.235 --> 42:56.169
So how do we fix it?

42:56.237 --> 43:00.071
Well, there's only one way...
from the outside in.

43:00.141 --> 43:03.167
[Thudding]

43:04.712 --> 43:07.647
They'll be lining up
for this job.

43:07.715 --> 43:10.309
Okay, so let's make ready
some dive gear.

43:10.384 --> 43:11.817
All right.

43:11.886 --> 43:14.150
O'Dell, pick two volunteers...

43:14.221 --> 43:15.518
Yes, sir.

43:15.590 --> 43:17.217
...besides yourself.

43:22.563 --> 43:25.157
WALLY: You want someone
to free-dive outside with you

43:25.232 --> 43:28.998
into the cold, black water,
make our way below the boat,

43:29.070 --> 43:30.503
locate the floodboards,

43:30.571 --> 43:32.334
and slither in between
the two hulls?

43:32.406 --> 43:34.465
That's right.
Find the leak and fix it.

43:34.542 --> 43:35.702
- At night.
- Hang on.

43:35.776 --> 43:37.107
We're still submerged.

43:37.178 --> 43:39.112
That means the main tanks are
full of water.

43:39.180 --> 43:40.112
This is in the dark, Dell.

43:40.181 --> 43:41.773
Yeah, well, chief thinks
that with the tower flooded,

43:41.849 --> 43:43.282
it gives the boat enough weight
to stay down

43:43.351 --> 43:45.546
while we blow some air
into the main tank.

43:45.620 --> 43:48.214
Oh, well [Scoffs] if that's
what the chief thinks.

43:48.289 --> 43:51.520
So... you're gonna go out there.
You're gonna go outside.

43:51.592 --> 43:52.684
Yes, that's right.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.853
With all these... happenings
happening.

43:54.929 --> 43:56.726
Look alive.

43:57.932 --> 44:00.230
All right.

44:00.301 --> 44:02.292
Who are the lucky bastards?

44:05.573 --> 44:07.302
[Scoffs] Fuck, no.

44:13.881 --> 44:14.905
Set.

44:27.294 --> 44:30.195
I asked him to go.
Buddy system.

44:51.752 --> 44:54.084
[Hatch opens, creaking]

45:19.146 --> 45:21.205
[Loud thud]

45:29.690 --> 45:31.453
- [Muffled] Ooh!
- Oh, shit!

46:58.412 --> 47:01.040
[Sighs]

47:11.425 --> 47:13.689
You and me, O'Dell.
Forward.

47:13.761 --> 47:16.252
You guys take aft.

47:20.701 --> 47:23.169
[All breathing heavily]

47:34.381 --> 47:36.144
[Grunts]

47:36.216 --> 47:38.377
[Panting]

47:40.020 --> 47:41.351
Shit!

47:45.358 --> 47:48.088
BRICE: 2330 hours.

47:48.161 --> 47:51.927
To confirm sinking
of German ship,

47:51.998 --> 47:54.432
four officers go topside...

47:54.501 --> 47:58.961
Commander Winters, myself,
Lieutenant Loomis,

47:59.039 --> 48:02.702
and Lieutenant
J.G. Stephen Coors.

48:06.213 --> 48:09.842
The night we lost
Old Man Winters...

48:09.916 --> 48:12.350
Odd time to bring that up.

48:12.419 --> 48:14.580
It's an odd place.

48:18.191 --> 48:22.217
So, how'd he bang his head
before he went over?

48:22.295 --> 48:23.455
You heard.

48:26.833 --> 48:28.027
I heard that the boat
hit something,

48:28.101 --> 48:30.160
but I never felt it down below.

48:30.236 --> 48:31.362
[Thudding]

48:43.549 --> 48:44.641
What?!

48:44.717 --> 48:46.309
I didn't say anything.

48:46.386 --> 48:49.219
I know,
but what were you thinking?

48:50.290 --> 48:52.190
Well...

48:54.694 --> 48:57.288
I used to hear about
these dock workers.

48:57.363 --> 49:00.127
They would get welded up
in these kind of places.

49:00.199 --> 49:05.136
And then... they were
never heard from again.

49:05.204 --> 49:06.637
Wally?

49:06.706 --> 49:09.903
You are so fucking
out-of-bounds with that shit!

49:22.422 --> 49:24.253
Let's keep moving.

49:31.597 --> 49:34.862
Forward trim tank,
it looks like.

49:34.934 --> 49:36.367
Better drive some wedges.

49:36.436 --> 49:37.425
Yeah.

49:38.838 --> 49:40.669
[Grunts, exhales sharply]

49:42.275 --> 49:46.211
So anything I say...
stays here...

49:46.279 --> 49:47.712
this side of the hull.

49:47.780 --> 49:51.045
[Breathlessly]
Yeah. Yeah.

49:51.117 --> 49:53.051
There were survivors
from the sinking.

49:53.119 --> 49:55.610
- [Indistinct shouting]
- Brice and Loomis even, uh...

49:55.688 --> 49:57.952
even tried to fish a few out,

49:58.024 --> 50:01.460
but... Winters had other ideas,

50:01.527 --> 50:03.791
and, uh...

50:03.863 --> 50:06.855
he ordered a gunnery party
topside.

50:06.933 --> 50:08.525
Well, three of us had a problem

50:08.601 --> 50:11.365
with machine-gunning
those men right in the water,

50:11.437 --> 50:13.769
I mean,
even if they were German.

50:14.941 --> 50:16.431
There was an argument.

50:17.944 --> 50:20.606
It got kind of heated.

50:25.618 --> 50:27.381
Well, why didn't you tell us?!

50:27.453 --> 50:28.647
I guess, uh...

50:30.289 --> 50:32.223
I guess we were trying
to protect him...

50:32.291 --> 50:34.122
felt Winters was
a pretty good C.O.,

50:34.193 --> 50:36.753
even if he could be a tough
son of a bitch sometimes.

50:36.829 --> 50:40.595
For his reputation...
you know, his family's sake.

50:40.666 --> 50:42.293
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...

50:42.368 --> 50:44.233
I still don't see
how he hit his head.

50:50.476 --> 50:51.568
Slippery metal.

50:52.578 --> 50:54.068
Bad footing.

50:55.748 --> 50:57.682
Accidents happen, right?

51:07.560 --> 51:08.788
[Gasps]

51:10.696 --> 51:14.427
[Screaming in distance]

51:24.444 --> 51:26.776
[Both gasping]

51:30.349 --> 51:32.112
Where the hell did
that come from?!

51:32.185 --> 51:33.277
Near or aft?

51:34.620 --> 51:36.520
Crew, sound off!

51:36.589 --> 51:38.113
Get them out of there!
Get them out!!

51:38.191 --> 51:39.123
O'Dell!

51:39.192 --> 51:40.454
[Clanking]

51:40.526 --> 51:43.017
Sound off, O'Dell!

51:49.035 --> 51:50.468
- Oh!
- Sir!

51:50.536 --> 51:52.697
Fuck, was that you?

51:52.772 --> 51:54.740
The light!

52:06.986 --> 52:08.419
[All scream]

52:14.694 --> 52:18.460
[Shuddering]
We gotta get him out.

52:18.531 --> 52:20.328
Come on, guys.

52:20.399 --> 52:21.991
- How are we gonna...
- [Thudding]

52:27.507 --> 52:29.372
Did you see that?

52:48.661 --> 52:50.458
What happened, guys?! Come on!
What happened out there?!

52:50.530 --> 52:52.361
[All talking]

52:52.431 --> 52:53.420
- Talk to me.
- Don't touch me.

52:53.499 --> 52:54.557
Did you fix it?

52:54.634 --> 52:56.534
Which one of you boys
was screaming out there?

52:56.602 --> 52:58.126
- Are we a man down?
- Don't touch me!

52:58.204 --> 52:59.637
- Are we a man down?!
- Shut up!

52:59.705 --> 53:00.637
Who was screaming?!

53:00.706 --> 53:02.697
Come on, grow some dicks
and shut up!

53:02.775 --> 53:04.037
[Choking]

53:04.110 --> 53:06.635
Now, where is Mr. O...

53:08.381 --> 53:10.815
[Thudding]

53:10.883 --> 53:14.216
Coors... where's Coors?

53:17.823 --> 53:20.223
You tell me that's him.

53:20.293 --> 53:22.887
That's gotta be Coors.
He's still alive, right?

53:22.962 --> 53:24.554
Sir...

53:24.630 --> 53:27.929
that is the one person
I can guarantee it's not.

53:32.371 --> 53:33.736
[Thudding continues]

53:38.511 --> 53:40.308
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

53:40.379 --> 53:41.607
- Don't! Don't!
- Hey, easy.

53:41.681 --> 53:43.239
Easy, Stumbo.
Easy, easy.

53:43.316 --> 53:45.250
- Easy, easy.
- Was that a "B"...

53:45.318 --> 53:47.616
dash, dot, dot, dot?

53:47.687 --> 53:48.915
I didn't hear a "B."

53:48.988 --> 53:50.250
[Thudding continues]

53:50.323 --> 53:52.917
Dot, dash..."A"...
thought I heard an "A."

53:52.992 --> 53:55.222
No, that's not morse.

53:55.294 --> 53:57.660
It's just some shit
got caught up on the bow planes.

53:57.730 --> 53:59.630
Now it's smacking up against...

53:59.699 --> 54:02.031
"C"... you hear a "C"?

54:02.101 --> 54:04.535
Dash, dot, dash, dot...
definitely a "C."

54:04.604 --> 54:06.299
It's hull sounds.

54:06.372 --> 54:09.136
You guys are getting lathered up
about hull sounds.

54:09.208 --> 54:12.109
Now, would somebody please tell
us what happened to Mr. Coors?

54:12.178 --> 54:15.204
"Back"... B-A-C-K.

54:15.281 --> 54:16.009
He's back.

54:16.082 --> 54:17.413
And where'd you get
the "K" from?

54:17.483 --> 54:19.075
Dash, dot, dash...
while you were talking.

54:19.151 --> 54:21.119
Hey, champ, you can stay
the hell out of this.

54:21.187 --> 54:24.281
- And the rest of you...
- Enough, already, enough!

54:24.357 --> 54:26.917
In the wardroom, 5 minutes.

54:26.993 --> 54:29.826
Keep your mouths shut
till we debrief.

54:31.330 --> 54:33.594
LOOMIS:
Did you finish the job?

54:33.666 --> 54:35.099
Yes, sir, absolutely.

54:35.167 --> 54:36.896
Right, Wally? Wally?

54:36.969 --> 54:38.903
Oh, yeah, I'm finished.

54:40.573 --> 54:43.133
All right, so, look,
if the weather is good,

54:43.209 --> 54:45.234
we surface tonight,
we recharge the batteries.

54:45.311 --> 54:47.074
We pour on the diesel,
keep pushing for the barn.

54:47.146 --> 54:49.239
O'DELL: Our barn?

54:49.315 --> 54:52.375
Mr. Brice, southern English
port's gonna be

54:52.451 --> 54:54.510
more than two days away.

54:54.587 --> 54:56.179
Two days away, Mr. Brice!

54:56.255 --> 54:58.519
[Indistinct conversations]

54:58.591 --> 55:01.424
Kingsley here is a navigational
officer. He knows the way.

55:01.494 --> 55:03.086
I know all the ports,
the depths,

55:03.162 --> 55:05.096
where the submarine nets are,
the mine fields.

55:05.164 --> 55:06.859
Yeah, and have
the R.A.F. bomb us

55:06.932 --> 55:09.332
because they mistake us
for a hostile boat... okay.

55:09.402 --> 55:11.233
There are safety corridors
that we can use...

55:11.303 --> 55:12.998
Considered and rejected,
thank you.

55:13.072 --> 55:16.303
Mr. Brice, both our periscopes
are down, our sonar is gone.

55:16.375 --> 55:18.536
We are blind and nearly deaf.

55:18.611 --> 55:19.543
Our men are in a bad way,

55:19.612 --> 55:21.375
and now we've lost
two of our senior officers.

55:21.447 --> 55:23.005
Welcome to the war, O'Dell.

55:23.082 --> 55:24.845
This has nothing to do
with the war.

55:24.917 --> 55:27.283
Just how much longer
can we not say

55:27.353 --> 55:28.843
what we're all thinking?

55:32.391 --> 55:34.450
No one wants to be the first?

55:34.527 --> 55:36.495
Fine. Allow me.

55:36.562 --> 55:38.291
This submarine is haun...

55:38.364 --> 55:40.958
When I want your opinion,
Miss Page, I'll give it to you.

55:41.033 --> 55:45.026
I am not one of your men that
you can just dismiss, Mr. Brice!

55:47.006 --> 55:49.031
I don't believe
we're alone down here,

55:49.108 --> 55:51.542
and I know some of you think
the same way.

55:52.378 --> 55:54.209
Unless we find
a safe harbor soon,

55:54.280 --> 55:55.304
we're all going to end up like
your friend Mr. Coors.

55:55.381 --> 55:57.645
The loss of Lieutenant Coors
is unfortunate.

55:57.717 --> 56:00.277
It fails to affect our plans.

56:00.352 --> 56:01.785
[Clicks, static]

56:01.854 --> 56:04.618
Attention all hands...
it's daylight now.

56:04.690 --> 56:09.059
I expect to surface... at 1900,

56:09.128 --> 56:10.720
recharge the batteries,

56:10.796 --> 56:13.196
and proceed on base course
back to Connecticut.

56:13.265 --> 56:14.197
- That is all.
- [Switch clicks]

56:14.266 --> 56:15.460
You're 10 seconds away
from finding out

56:15.534 --> 56:17.297
what the penalty is
for mutiny at sea,

56:17.369 --> 56:19.132
'cause that's how long
it's gonna take me

56:19.205 --> 56:21.605
to open the armory
and reload that sidearm.

56:22.942 --> 56:25.672
Now, do either of you
care to say anything else

56:25.745 --> 56:29.442
that might further agitate
this crew or me?

56:33.018 --> 56:34.178
Mr. O'Dell?

56:40.159 --> 56:42.150
Yeah, I didn't think so.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.544
[Sighs]

57:03.616 --> 57:05.208
We just knock the nose around
a little bit,

57:05.284 --> 57:09.220
we're back on base,
so make it 2-8-5.

57:09.288 --> 57:10.380
Make it 2-8-5 true.

57:10.456 --> 57:11.980
2-8-5 true, sir.

Sound good?

57:20.866 --> 57:22.697
- Yes, sir.
- Sounds good, sir.

57:32.478 --> 57:35.072
Hey, you're oversteering.
Mind your rudder.

some resistance, sir.

kind of hydraulic failure.

58:43.115 --> 58:44.707
Oh, Christ.

58:44.783 --> 58:46.273
Must have overshot
our heading by...

58:46.352 --> 58:48.411
170 degrees.

59:04.703 --> 59:07.934
Oh, good. A gun.
Yeah, I needed a gun.

59:08.007 --> 59:10.100
I'll put that
with the prizes.

59:10.175 --> 59:14.771
Okay, I got feathers, crosses,
and strip-show icons...

When we tried to shut down
the props, no dice.

Wouldn't respond.

59:23.489 --> 59:25.548
We're on a runaway boat,
fellas.

59:25.624 --> 59:27.421
Now, can any of you top that?

59:27.493 --> 59:31.327
[Spits] Well...
I had a strange thought.

59:31.397 --> 59:32.489
Take a number.

59:32.564 --> 59:36.591
Yeah, but this one's
real creep-show stuff.

59:39.471 --> 59:45.410
What if, when we took on
that kraut ship...

59:45.477 --> 59:47.138
...we didn't sink 'em?

59:48.314 --> 59:53.411
What if... they sank us?

59:53.485 --> 59:55.350
Oh, that's a good twist.

59:58.324 --> 59:59.416
I don't get it.

59:59.491 --> 01:00:03.086
Might explain how that
dead kraut talked to Stumbo.

01:00:04.096 --> 01:00:05.188
I don't get it.

01:00:05.264 --> 01:00:07.198
And the controls...
that they froze up.

01:00:07.266 --> 01:00:08.699
No, they... they rusted up.

01:00:08.767 --> 01:00:11.327
That's because we're at the...
the bottom of the ocean.

01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:12.335
Flooded out.

01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:14.497
Of course, I'm not sure what all
that pounding was about.

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:18.839
Those are rescue divers...
pounding on the hull.

01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:20.208
Only it's too late.

01:00:20.279 --> 01:00:21.974
Shit, I get it.

01:00:22.047 --> 01:00:25.480
Hydrogen from the batteries...

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:29.145
CO2, ozone
from the electrical shorts...

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.017
that's what we're breathing
right now.

01:00:31.089 --> 01:00:34.024
Like those deep-sea divers
that don't get enough oxygen...

01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:36.652
head starts playing tricks
on 'em.

01:00:36.728 --> 01:00:40.027
We got mechanical problems,
that's all, okay?

01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:41.998
We always got
mechanical problems.

01:00:42.066 --> 01:00:44.159
Now, please...

01:00:44.235 --> 01:00:47.932
will you pinch this shit off?

01:00:48.006 --> 01:00:50.167
- Unless...
- Oh...

01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:52.175
It happened
during the depth charging.

01:00:52.243 --> 01:00:54.677
Remember that one?

01:00:54.746 --> 01:00:57.214

01:01:04.189 --> 01:01:07.454
So exactly how far
from England are we?

01:01:07.525 --> 01:01:09.755
Can I ask why you're asking?

01:01:09.827 --> 01:01:11.260
No.

01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:12.261
Right.

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:14.321
Uh, what's our heading?

01:01:14.399 --> 01:01:16.026
0-9-5.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.297
Right. Uh...

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:21.133
[Muttering indistinctly]

01:01:21.206 --> 01:01:23.470
May I ask why you're asking?

01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:27.136
Just in case the boat
can't make it back home...

01:01:27.212 --> 01:01:29.146
for whatever reason.

01:01:29.214 --> 01:01:31.808
LOOMIS: What do you suggest
we do about it, chief?

01:01:31.883 --> 01:01:33.214
[Indistinct voice]

01:01:33.284 --> 01:01:34.876
Come on.
Enough of the guessing games.

01:01:34.953 --> 01:01:37.888
- Pressure blinding the shafts.
- No, I don't think that's it.

01:01:37.956 --> 01:01:39.389
Just lay it out for us, chief.

01:01:39.457 --> 01:01:40.890
What about the I.M.O. pumps?

01:01:40.959 --> 01:01:43.792
I.M.O. pumps check out.
I don't think it's that either.

01:01:43.861 --> 01:01:46.694
The rudder has a dedicated line
from here to the stern.

01:01:46.764 --> 01:01:49.858
If we tap into there
somewhere aft,

01:01:49.934 --> 01:01:52.528
I think we should regain
our steering.

01:01:52.604 --> 01:01:54.902
But where are you gonna tap in?

01:01:54.973 --> 01:01:56.406
That's the thing.

01:01:56.474 --> 01:01:59.238
The line goes right through
the battery room.

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:01.505
That's a little dicey, isn't it,
without venting first?

01:02:01.579 --> 01:02:04.104
Just threading up
new hydraulics, no welding.

01:02:04.182 --> 01:02:05.774
Well, where are we at, anyway?

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:06.782
13 percent down.

01:02:06.851 --> 01:02:09.445
- 13 percent hydrogen?
- Keep your voice down.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.116
Look, I don't know any other
way to regain control...

01:02:27.405 --> 01:02:30.340
All right, but you gotta
make sure you're sealed off,

01:02:30.408 --> 01:02:32.842
'cause we don't want a repeat
of the <i>Hindenburg</i> here.

Let's keep this quiet.

- Not now.
- No, Mr. Loomis.

01:04:16.146 --> 01:04:18.478

Now, maybe this is
just a coincidence.

01:04:41.738 --> 01:04:43.729
I know Lieutenant Coors
wasn't too sure

01:04:43.807 --> 01:04:45.468
about the last star fix.

01:04:45.542 --> 01:04:47.134
But it sure seems like
we're going

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:50.702
right back to where
we sunk that German ship.

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:51.974
Clear the compartment.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:55.484
Everybody, give us 5 minutes.

01:04:55.552 --> 01:04:56.712
Go!

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:02.024
All right.
We're almost all set.

01:05:02.092 --> 01:05:04.026
Just repressurizing the line,

01:05:04.094 --> 01:05:06.460
see if we can't put the brakes
on this little joyride.

01:05:06.529 --> 01:05:08.690
[Rumbling, thudding]

01:05:10.934 --> 01:05:13.425
[Powers down, silence]

01:05:16.506 --> 01:05:19.339
I'll reset the bus.

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:22.878
Shit!

01:05:22.946 --> 01:05:24.846

[Hatch hinges creak]

01:05:29.185 --> 01:05:31.517
Hey, guys,
we lost power up here.

01:05:31.588 --> 01:05:32.714
Shut that goddamn door

01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:36.020
before I shut it
with your goddamn face!

01:05:39.929 --> 01:05:41.692
What are you saying, O'Dell?

01:05:41.764 --> 01:05:44.232
It's not a coincidence?

01:05:45.668 --> 01:05:47.568
Somebody put us on this course?

01:05:47.637 --> 01:05:49.571
I'm just asking a question.

01:05:49.639 --> 01:05:51.402
Let me ask one.

01:05:51.474 --> 01:05:53.567
Where were <i>you</i>
when the rudder went over?

01:05:53.643 --> 01:05:55.235
Huh?

01:05:55.311 --> 01:05:57.006
This course heads back
to England,

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.844
and I've noticed you've had
a hard-on for anything English.

01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:01.144
So where were you, O'Dell?

01:06:01.217 --> 01:06:03.310
Back of the boat... messing with
the rudder assembly?

01:06:03.386 --> 01:06:04.512
Or did you get some motormac...

01:06:04.587 --> 01:06:06.316
That is the craziest thing
I have ever heard!

01:06:06.389 --> 01:06:07.981
Not as crazy
as what you're saying!

01:06:08.057 --> 01:06:10.321
I'm tired
of this hoodoo horseshit!

01:06:10.393 --> 01:06:12.156
It is <i>not</i>
what you think it is!

01:06:12.228 --> 01:06:14.890
It is not even remotely
<i>fucking</i> possible!

01:06:14.964 --> 01:06:16.659
Okay?!

01:09:27.156 --> 01:09:29.317
I'm gonna change up my scrub.

- Don't...

anything at all?

All I know is what Coors
told me.

01:14:53.347 --> 01:14:54.939
And apparently...

01:14:55.016 --> 01:14:59.453
Captain Winters wanted to shoot
the German survivors.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.454
Mr. Brice and Mr. Loomis

01:15:01.522 --> 01:15:06.289
and Mr... Mr. Coors...
wanted to help.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.261
Apparently Captain Winters
lost the argument.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.855
Well, that's interesting.

[Breathes deeply]

01:15:13.768 --> 01:15:18.467
But it's not what I heard...
from Mr. Brice.

01:15:20.841 --> 01:15:23.776
[Breathlessly]
Lieutenant?

01:15:23.844 --> 01:15:26.608
Are you sure he came back here?

01:15:26.681 --> 01:15:28.114
BRICE: Looking for me?

[Gasps]

01:15:30.017 --> 01:15:32.485
I, uh...

01:15:32.553 --> 01:15:37.149
Just... reporting, sir,
that the heating is down.

01:15:37.224 --> 01:15:40.557
And, uh...
the bow's levers are stuck.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:42.424
Stumbo's working on it
right now.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:44.225
And that we show
90 pounds of compressed air

01:15:44.298 --> 01:15:47.734
still left in the system,
and I... wasn't sure

01:15:47.802 --> 01:15:50.669
if you wanted to use that
when we tried to surface

01:15:50.738 --> 01:15:52.672
or use it now
so we can breathe.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.605
Shinola.

01:15:56.043 --> 01:15:57.237
Sir?

01:15:57.311 --> 01:16:00.474
Running out of shinola, too.

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:10.447
We also wanted to ask you
about Captain Winters...

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:12.958
whether there was anything
you could tell us

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:14.517
about what happened that night

01:16:14.595 --> 01:16:16.358
that might help us
to understand...

01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:19.763
Don't pretend you don't know.

01:16:19.834 --> 01:16:22.428
Just don't pretend anymore.

01:16:28.843 --> 01:16:30.640
Well, wasn't that awkward?

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:34.613
STUMBO: Maybe Hoag was right.
Maybe we already bought it.

01:16:34.682 --> 01:16:40.018
If not the depth charge,
then... the hydrogen.

01:16:40.087 --> 01:16:41.952
If not the hydrogen, then...

01:16:42.022 --> 01:16:43.956
[Shudders]
Maybe the cold.

01:16:44.024 --> 01:16:45.184
And if not that,

01:16:45.259 --> 01:16:48.524
then we got a big evil spirit
batting cleanup.

01:16:48.596 --> 01:16:51.190
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on, Stumbo.

01:16:51.265 --> 01:16:54.325
There should only be
so many ways a guy can die.

01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:56.460
Listen to me.
CO2 hangs low.

01:16:56.537 --> 01:16:59.370
It starts from the floor up,
and I need you right now...

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.032
- No, no.
- To get up on your feet.

01:17:01.108 --> 01:17:03.133
- Maybe I just need to...
- Stumbo. Stumbo!

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:05.474
- Let me try.
- We already bought it.

01:17:05.546 --> 01:17:07.036
Come on, Stumbo. Head up.

01:17:07.114 --> 01:17:09.048
- Over and over...
- I need you to sit up.

01:17:09.116 --> 01:17:11.016
- Over and over again.
- Look at me.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:12.575
Now look at me.
Look at me.

01:17:12.653 --> 01:17:14.245
- [Panting]
- Good.

01:17:15.956 --> 01:17:17.423
Feel that?

01:17:17.491 --> 01:17:19.322
Well, you're alive, then,
aren't you?

01:17:19.393 --> 01:17:20.883
You fuckin'...

01:17:20.961 --> 01:17:22.929
- Stumbo...
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

01:17:22.997 --> 01:17:25.488
- Take it easy! Hey!
- Relax, man!

01:17:25.566 --> 01:17:27.329
Stumbo!

01:17:27.401 --> 01:17:30.336
Isn't there a winch or a pulley

01:17:30.404 --> 01:17:32.497
or maybe a come-along
in a bowsman's locker?

01:17:32.573 --> 01:17:33.665
- Yeah.
- Can't we use that?

01:17:33.741 --> 01:17:35.174
You know what he's
talking about, Stumbo?

01:17:35.242 --> 01:17:36.641
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:39.201
Come... we need it. Come on.
Show... show me, Stumbo.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.373
We've got to get it.
Okay, come on. Come on.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:44.849
[Panting]

01:17:44.919 --> 01:17:47.285
So, tell me
why three officers

01:17:47.354 --> 01:17:50.346
would conspire to kill
their captain

01:17:50.424 --> 01:17:52.688
and cover it up.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.921
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it?

01:17:54.995 --> 01:17:56.587
[Panting]
What if I am?

01:17:56.664 --> 01:17:58.859
I can see I'm not the only one.

01:18:01.435 --> 01:18:04.029
Loomis was up
for a major citation.

01:18:04.104 --> 01:18:06.072
And Brice was ready
for his own command.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.472
He was from a naval family.
He went to Annapolis.

01:18:08.542 --> 01:18:11.010
Coors had this beautiful girl
waiting for him back in Boston

01:18:11.078 --> 01:18:12.841
that he was always
talking about, Claire.

01:18:12.913 --> 01:18:15.404
These guys had everything
to live for.

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:19.976
By that reasoning...
they had everything to lose.

01:18:20.054 --> 01:18:22.545
[Soft rumbling]

01:18:26.026 --> 01:18:28.290
Are we missing somebody?

01:18:28.362 --> 01:18:30.193
[Rumbling continues]

01:18:44.879 --> 01:18:46.369
Wallace...

01:18:48.449 --> 01:18:49.939
Wallace?

01:18:51.518 --> 01:18:52.485
- No!
- [Gasps]

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:54.077
- No! No!
- Shh!

01:18:54.154 --> 01:18:56.520
- No-o-o!
- It's just us.

01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:58.615
It's just... us.

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.853
We're running out of plays
in the playbook.

01:19:03.931 --> 01:19:06.695
Do you have... any idea
why the boat is going back

01:19:06.767 --> 01:19:09.634
or how we can get control
of it?

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:10.795
[Panting]

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:13.032
I've been checking the
literature on this subject.

01:19:13.107 --> 01:19:15.371
And the thing we know
about maledictions is...

01:19:15.442 --> 01:19:16.534
Maledictions?

01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:17.770
Look it up.

01:19:17.845 --> 01:19:20.075
Maledictions don't issue
from Heaven or Hell

01:19:20.147 --> 01:19:22.638
but from some unresolved place
in between.

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:24.343
In fact, there's a great...

01:19:24.418 --> 01:19:26.682
Wallace...
we're running out of air.

01:19:28.756 --> 01:19:31.691
Suffice to say...

01:19:31.759 --> 01:19:36.287
the malediction needs
satisfaction

01:19:36.363 --> 01:19:39.127
in order to escape
its netherworld.

01:19:39.199 --> 01:19:41.963
And if you had to guess...

01:19:42.036 --> 01:19:45.631
what would satisfy
our malediction?

01:19:45.706 --> 01:19:47.731
Old Man Winters never
got a chance

01:19:47.808 --> 01:19:49.298

did he?

Wallace, leave yours here.

01:19:59.887 --> 01:20:02.014
We gotta dig up
some more light.

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:03.420
Okay, listen, uh...

01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:07.824

you'll stay on your feet, okay?

My ship...
the Fort James hospital ship.

01:24:49.142 --> 01:24:51.736
[Shuddering]
So what you're saying is...

01:24:51.811 --> 01:24:55.269
that the submarine
Kingsley saw...

01:24:55.348 --> 01:24:57.942
the one
he thought was German...

01:24:58.017 --> 01:24:59.348
Wasn't.

01:25:02.422 --> 01:25:03.650
So it was an accident?

01:25:03.723 --> 01:25:06.419
Not when he left us
in the water to die.

01:25:06.493 --> 01:25:09.656
Not when he heard the cries
for help in English.

01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:10.661
You actually believe

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.857

Stumbo, see if you can crack
this hatch. Use a crowbar.

that's a friendly out there.

Well, neither do I.

now and take our chances

what?

We sunk one of their
finest fleet submarines

01:29:44.803 --> 01:29:46.896

01:32:51.923 --> 01:32:53.982
Looks like we're definitely
gonna lose some paint

01:32:54.058 --> 01:32:55.150
on this one, sir!

01:32:55.226 --> 01:32:58.320
I kept looking for some way
just...

01:32:58.396 --> 01:33:01.627
just to... take it back,

01:33:01.699 --> 01:33:03.792
to make it end right...

01:33:03.868 --> 01:33:07.201
some way without
dishonoring Winters.

01:33:08.906 --> 01:33:11.670
[Chuckles]

01:33:11.743 --> 01:33:14.906
I was gonna wear this uniform
back to port.

01:33:16.281 --> 01:33:18.272
Now...

01:33:24.155 --> 01:33:26.248
What should I do, Miss Page?

01:33:26.324 --> 01:33:29.691
You give me the light
so that I can signal for help.

01:33:29.761 --> 01:33:31.092
I don't...

01:33:32.997 --> 01:33:35.022
God, I don't know!

01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:49.102
[Thunder crashes]

01:33:55.953 --> 01:33:57.887
[Thunder crashes]

01:34:00.525 --> 01:34:03.517
[Thunder rumbling]

01:34:12.103 --> 01:34:14.731
I just figured out
why he didn't kill me, too.

01:34:15.773 --> 01:34:17.240
He didn't have to.

01:34:18.009 --> 01:34:18.873
[Gasps]

01:34:20.378 --> 01:34:22.312
[Gunshot, thunder crashes]

01:34:25.883 --> 01:34:26.975
[Gunshot]

01:34:36.361 --> 01:34:39.797
Aah!

01:34:57.215 --> 01:34:59.046
[Thunder crashes]

01:35:02.653 --> 01:35:05.918
Hey! Over here!

01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:07.617
Come back!

01:35:07.725 --> 01:35:10.489
[Voice breaking]
Come back.

01:35:12.497 --> 01:35:14.431
[Thunder crashes]

01:35:14.499 --> 01:35:16.490
[Panting]

01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:20.997
[Panting]

01:35:21.939 --> 01:35:23.304
[Exhales sharply]

01:35:50.401 --> 01:35:53.393
[Rattling]

01:36:11.522 --> 01:36:14.013
[Exhales deeply]

01:36:16.294 --> 01:36:21.231
Well, you weren't the first
woman that ever slapped me,

01:36:21.299 --> 01:36:23.392
and you won't be the last.

01:36:23.468 --> 01:36:26.528
But that was a good thing
you done for me back there.

01:36:28.439 --> 01:36:29.770
Well done, Miss Page.

01:36:32.944 --> 01:36:35.708
Well done, Mr. Stumbo.

01:36:37.682 --> 01:36:40.515
Dead but not buried, I see.

01:36:43.621 --> 01:36:44.588
Pardon me?

01:36:44.655 --> 01:36:46.350
Your vessel.

01:36:46.424 --> 01:36:49.757
[Creaking, rumbling]

01:37:05.943 --> 01:37:09.777
[Water splashing]

01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:21.915
So, what would you say
if you had to explain it all?

01:37:22.994 --> 01:37:25.656
Does seem rather unlikely now,
doesn't it?

01:37:28.733 --> 01:37:30.997
Have you thought that...

01:37:31.068 --> 01:37:33.002
that maybe
when Captain Winters died,

01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:36.836
he just... died, and that was it?

01:37:36.908 --> 01:37:38.842
And the rest...

01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:40.377
[Exhales deeply]

01:37:40.444 --> 01:37:42.412
And the rest...

01:37:43.915 --> 01:37:45.246
I don't know.

01:37:48.386 --> 01:37:51.378
You say whatever
you have to say, ensign.

01:37:52.623 --> 01:37:56.457
I'll always believe we were
brought back here for a reason.

01:38:02.233 --> 01:38:04.724
[Rumbling]

01:38:31.796 --> 01:38:34.797
[Suspenseful instrumental music
plays]

01:45:15.732 --> 01:45:18.360
[Music ends]
