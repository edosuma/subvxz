WEBVTT

00:00.283 --> 00:04.093
I killed someone and I need
you to help me get rid of him.

00:03.095 --> 00:04.471
How about a job?

00:04.497 --> 00:06.259
When can you move
to the Cabinet Office?

00:06.259 --> 00:08.022
What's in the Cabinet Office?
- A Russian spy.

00:08.047 --> 00:10.489
I'm sorry but I can't
just take you in.

00:10.489 --> 00:11.932
The Cabinet Office is
an elite placement.

00:11.957 --> 00:16.491
We prepare everything for the
Prime Minister and his Cabinet.

00:17.016 --> 00:17.991
If I give you money
there have to be results.

00:18.016 --> 00:20.144
I want to know more about her.

00:20.144 --> 00:21.872
Compromise. Coercion.

00:21.887 --> 00:23.241
Her brother is probably
a homosexual.

00:23.766 --> 00:25.309
We know that Russians accessed

00:25.309 --> 00:26.852
information shared at two private

00:26.877 --> 00:28.052
Cabinet Office meetings.

00:28.077 --> 00:30.462
So it is someone who was
at both of those meetings.

00:30.487 --> 00:31.491
Correct.

00:31.516 --> 00:33.702
My predecessor was called
Phillip Jarvis, wasn't he?

00:33.727 --> 00:34.982
What happened to Jarvis?

00:35.007 --> 00:37.291
They murdered him,
the Russians.

00:37.316 --> 00:38.531
What if they murder me?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.357 --> 02:10.971
Thanks for meeting me.

02:17.066 --> 02:18.272
It's just us here.

02:18.297 --> 02:20.482
You don't even need to
keep your voice down.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.712
How can I help?

02:21.737 --> 02:22.682
I don't even know.

02:24.657 --> 02:25.972
All right. Come on.

02:29.667 --> 02:30.632
Sit down.

02:30.657 --> 02:31.991
Do you want a drink
or anything?

02:32.016 --> 02:33.142
No, thank you.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.692
I did go to Ml5 about this.

02:35.717 --> 02:38.001
I have been waiting for them to
respond to me and no-one has.

02:38.026 --> 02:39.512
I spoke to Kim Philby.

02:39.537 --> 02:40.911
I don't know.

02:40.936 --> 02:42.991
Maybe Philby will
respond to you.

02:43.016 --> 02:44.552
I know that the Brits,
the Americans,

02:44.577 --> 02:46.242
they're working
together and...

02:47.617 --> 02:49.842
Look, I should tell you,
when all this happened

02:49.867 --> 02:51.352
I was actually drunk.

02:51.377 --> 02:55.282
And that is possibly why
Ml5 aren't responding.

02:55.307 --> 02:57.082
It's possible they know
that I do drink.

02:57.107 --> 02:58.981
That's just something...

02:59.006 --> 03:01.262
All you Brits drink,
don't you?

03:01.287 --> 03:03.062
Well, yes.

03:03.087 --> 03:05.109
The point is that I
remember everything

03:05.109 --> 03:07.132
that was said,
and, well,

03:07.157 --> 03:11.231
you gentlemen,
Americans,

03:11.256 --> 03:12.412
you're saving our lives.

03:18.717 --> 03:19.752
What's going on?

03:21.637 --> 03:22.742
What's happening?

03:26.006 --> 03:28.422
I think there's a Russian
spy in the Cabinet Office.

03:31.387 --> 03:33.082
What's your full name?

03:33.107 --> 03:34.202
Phillip Jarvis.

03:37.377 --> 03:38.991
And what's your address?

03:43.026 --> 03:44.432
You can trust me.

03:58.816 --> 04:01.432
Jerry Roxborough
and Mark Stevens.

04:01.457 --> 04:03.921
Both of these men
are senior civil servants.

04:03.946 --> 04:06.692
Stevens, the more senior.

04:06.717 --> 04:08.500
Both men were at the
private Cabinet Office

04:08.500 --> 04:10.282
meetings in '37 and '43

04:10.307 --> 04:12.642
where the leaks came from.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.514
Either one or both
could be the mole,

04:14.514 --> 04:16.362
but she and I lean towards

04:16.387 --> 04:17.841
Mr Roxborough.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.329
He has a flashy
new car that

04:19.329 --> 04:20.791
Feef says exceeds
his salary.

04:20.815 --> 04:23.512
Yes, he presents as sort
of upper crust.

04:23.537 --> 04:24.885
But of course the
upper classes

04:24.885 --> 04:26.232
tend not to flash
their money about.

04:26.257 --> 04:28.362
They have holes in their
jumpers, that sort of thing.

04:28.387 --> 04:30.242
He has a very posh accent
but then the other day

04:30.267 --> 04:32.202
he said op-pera.

04:32.227 --> 04:34.121
As opposed to what?

04:34.146 --> 04:35.832
Opera. It's a sort of...

04:35.857 --> 04:37.282
We just wouldn't
say it like that.

04:37.307 --> 04:38.682
Brits are such
fuckin' snobs.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.911
What about the other
guy, Stevens?

04:41.936 --> 04:44.082
He is taking early
retirement. Wife is ill.

04:44.107 --> 04:46.921
If the Russians had embedded
someone at Steven's level,

04:46.946 --> 04:48.801
they'd never let him out.

04:48.826 --> 04:50.001
Sick wife or no sick wife.

04:50.026 --> 04:51.642
My money is on Roxborough.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.911
Jarvis, why didn't he get
you these names?

04:53.936 --> 04:55.572
He was killed before
he got to me.

04:55.597 --> 04:57.464
But he checked out the files

04:57.464 --> 04:59.332
a month before he died.

04:59.357 --> 05:01.123
Maybe he didn't trust you.

05:02.155 --> 05:03.979
Maybe he wanted to be sure.

05:05.635 --> 05:06.920
Which is what we need to be.

05:08.845 --> 05:10.700
So now what?

05:10.725 --> 05:12.700
Get to know Mr Roxborough.

05:12.725 --> 05:13.779
Earn his trust.

05:15.285 --> 05:16.779
Lh-

05:18.004 --> 05:19.180
Yeah.

05:19.205 --> 05:20.140
Very good.

05:21.365 --> 05:22.888
Luckily English men are more

05:22.888 --> 05:24.410
sexually reserved than Americans.

05:24.435 --> 05:25.779
She's an anthropologist, too.

05:27.565 --> 05:30.620
Jerry and I are seeing a
matinee together at the weekend.

05:30.645 --> 05:32.620
And until then?

05:32.645 --> 05:33.899
We'll keep watching him.

05:33.924 --> 05:35.500
We're at work all
the time anyway.

05:35.525 --> 05:37.930
Pressure is on because of the
new ministry we're building.

05:40.695 --> 05:43.060
Of National Insurance.

05:43.085 --> 05:45.057
If you ask me,
more than one commie

05:45.057 --> 05:47.029
has infiltrated
this Government.

05:48.725 --> 05:51.420
Yes, well, National Insurance
doesn't cost anybody very much,

05:51.445 --> 05:54.340
and will essentially do a great deal
to eliminate unnecessary suffering.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.779
You said she was on our side.

05:58.804 --> 06:02.989
She seems awfully protective of
the Attlee Government to me.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.779
That boyfriend has gotten
into her head.

06:05.804 --> 06:07.140
They're dating?

06:07.165 --> 06:08.420
Jesus.

06:08.445 --> 06:11.260
If she marries him, just
think of the access we'll get.

06:11.285 --> 06:14.839
Yes, well, if you want to
keep her onboard, maybe

06:14.864 --> 06:16.450
don't put her on edge.

06:16.475 --> 06:18.170
I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

06:19.065 --> 06:20.800
It's a seduction.

06:20.825 --> 06:22.759
You have to make them feel safe.

06:22.784 --> 06:25.969
There's other ways of keeping
an asset in play, aren't there?

06:25.994 --> 06:27.810
Especially if they're
starting to buck.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.749
Yes, there are other ways.

07:17.495 --> 07:20.290
Good morning, Mr Roxborough.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.630
Good morning.

07:35.165 --> 07:37.140
Excuse me. Miss Garrick?

07:46.095 --> 07:47.659
I can't get it out.

07:49.295 --> 07:50.989
It is. It's working.

07:51.014 --> 07:52.989
Can you open the door, please?
- One second.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.607
There's a huge wet
stain now anyway.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.200
Everyone will notice.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.420
Just roll up your skirt.

08:05.215 --> 08:06.550
Yes.

08:06.575 --> 08:07.659
Yes, that's fine.

08:13.565 --> 08:15.979
OK. Tie this around your waist.

08:18.855 --> 08:20.859
You look very chic and
no-one will notice.

08:23.855 --> 08:25.999
Thank you.

08:26.024 --> 08:27.789
Excuse me, the door's locked.

08:27.814 --> 08:29.070
One second.

08:36.965 --> 08:38.597
I want all the
ministries to confirm

08:38.597 --> 08:40.230
and double check
these numbers

08:40.255 --> 08:41.729
as we go round.

08:41.754 --> 08:44.859
Thanks, by the way, to Miss
Simmons for tracking them down.

08:44.884 --> 08:46.630
Clever little thing, isn't she?

08:46.655 --> 08:48.580
She's actually quite tall.

08:48.605 --> 08:51.872
We are anticipating
a new staff

08:51.872 --> 08:55.140
of approximately 32,500

08:55.165 --> 08:56.340
for the new ministry.

08:56.365 --> 08:58.858
That is 8,000 more than
originally projected,

08:58.858 --> 09:01.350
and I've still yet to see

09:01.375 --> 09:03.477
reports about where
those cuts

09:03.477 --> 09:05.580
might be found from
either the MOHH

09:05.605 --> 09:09.190
or the MOFP regarding
nationalisations next year.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.380
I need to see those projections.

09:13.165 --> 09:16.510
What we are attempting
is as logistically complex

09:16.535 --> 09:18.510
as building the pyramids.

09:18.535 --> 09:19.930
And we don't have any slaves.

09:22.735 --> 09:24.789
Thank you for cooking.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.100
You're very welcome.

09:31.934 --> 09:32.830
I should go.

09:33.934 --> 09:34.999
Really?

09:35.024 --> 09:36.640
I have a mound of reading.

09:36.665 --> 09:38.292
History of the Jews
in Palestine.

09:38.292 --> 09:39.919
History of the Arabs
in Palestine.

09:39.944 --> 09:41.710
History of the British
in Palestine.

09:41.735 --> 09:43.500
The Turks, the Canaanites,
and on and on.

09:45.855 --> 09:48.140
Look, don't go.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.620
It's Friday night.

09:51.645 --> 09:53.380
I thought, "Can I cook
for you" was code.

09:56.455 --> 09:57.789
Code for what?

10:13.125 --> 10:14.940
Nice place.

10:14.965 --> 10:17.110
Do you rent or...?
- Mind your business.

11:24.085 --> 11:26.480
Oh... Not there.

11:26.505 --> 11:27.909
Sorry.

11:58.564 --> 12:00.070
Flowers.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.789
Outstanding observational skills.

12:01.814 --> 12:05.110
I'm so sorry. I overslept.
I will be one second. One second.

12:06.175 --> 12:07.539
Right.

12:16.814 --> 12:18.470
Where did you grow up?

12:18.495 --> 12:19.900
London.

12:19.925 --> 12:22.560
You?
- Outside London.

12:22.585 --> 12:24.030
Do you have brothers, sisters?

12:26.245 --> 12:29.110
I'd like to ask, just so we're
straight, and everything...

12:30.665 --> 12:33.960
...did you ask for a lift because
you like my car, or because...?

12:35.175 --> 12:36.720
...you know?

12:36.745 --> 12:38.590
Well, because...

12:38.615 --> 12:39.430
You know.

12:43.014 --> 12:45.430
You know, I've really been
enjoying working with you.

12:45.455 --> 12:48.869
Even if it's on this
stupid ministry.

12:48.894 --> 12:51.030
Such a relief to be
out together.

12:51.055 --> 12:52.859
As friends.

12:52.884 --> 12:55.030
We don't have to be
so bloody neutral.

12:56.665 --> 12:58.280
What?

12:58.305 --> 12:59.900
What happened?
Is it the engine?

12:59.925 --> 13:00.999
No, no. It's all right.

13:01.024 --> 13:02.470
We'll just have to pull up.

13:07.615 --> 13:09.869
What? It still seems to run.

13:09.894 --> 13:11.999
I don't want to damage it.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.030
Um... I have a mechanic.

13:14.055 --> 13:15.789
What? In the glove box?

13:17.904 --> 13:19.270
His card. Ah.

14:24.105 --> 14:28.280

Oh, that's very kind,
thank you.

15:00.755 --> 15:01.920
So glad you could make it.

15:01.945 --> 15:03.050
She overslept.

15:03.075 --> 15:05.280
No, there was some trouble
with the car, I'm so sorry.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.520
You were wonderful, Pris.

15:06.545 --> 15:07.790
Mm, when I sing, birds die.

15:09.665 --> 15:10.970
Nice to see you, Miss Symonds.

15:13.795 --> 15:15.330
Slap at him.

15:15.355 --> 15:16.740
What?
- Nothing.

15:23.364 --> 15:25.690
Thank you so much for coming.

15:25.715 --> 15:28.339
We pride ourselves at the
Gilbert and Sullivan Society on not

15:28.364 --> 15:31.310
overstaying our welcome, but if
I could just have your attention

15:31.335 --> 15:32.940
for a moment longer.

15:32.965 --> 15:36.310
I did want to take this opportunity
to remember our dear departed

15:36.335 --> 15:38.418
colleague and friend,
Phillip Jarvis,

15:38.418 --> 15:40.500
who was such a robust member

15:40.525 --> 15:44.140
of the organisation,
he is missed.

15:44.165 --> 15:46.710
And I'm very pleased
to announce formally,

15:46.735 --> 15:49.080
although you may have
noticed on your way in,

15:49.105 --> 15:52.200
that we made it through
the necessary bureaucracy,

15:52.225 --> 15:54.439
and our rehearsal room is
now named in his memory.

15:57.464 --> 15:59.689
Where did Miss Garrick go?

15:59.714 --> 16:01.210
Oh, she and Jarvis were...

16:03.435 --> 16:04.559
Lh-

16:06.155 --> 16:07.449
Excuse me.

16:17.399 --> 16:19.282
Is everything all right?

16:19.307 --> 16:20.762
Yes, of course.

16:20.787 --> 16:21.942
Why wouldn't it be?

16:25.706 --> 16:28.341
I fell in love during
the war, too.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.231
What makes you think
I was in love?

16:30.256 --> 16:32.152
Oh, Mr Roxburgh said
you and Mr Jarvis...

16:34.817 --> 16:36.792
Well, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

16:36.817 --> 16:38.872
He seemed like a
wonderful man.

16:38.897 --> 16:42.042
Mr Jarvis was a drunk,
he smelled like a drunk.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.322
I avoided him.

16:45.376 --> 16:47.632

Oh, no. Not for me, thanks.

17:56.887 --> 17:59.512
Next week, I want to look at
transposing you down a few keys.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.122
Oh, next week I'll be en
route to Dumbarton Oaks.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.512
Well, peace is no excuse
for missing rehearsal, Jarvis.

18:10.897 --> 18:12.809
August 21st, 1944,
a day that would

18:12.809 --> 18:14.722
be remembered
throughout history

18:14.747 --> 18:17.402
as the moment that
three great Allied nations

18:17.427 --> 18:20.471
met here at Dumbarton Oaks
to lay the groundwork for

18:20.496 --> 18:23.722
a brand-new organisation
- the United Nations.

18:23.747 --> 18:26.802
To ensure that war becomes
a horror of the past.

18:26.827 --> 18:29.772
The American delegation,
the British, the Russian...

18:29.797 --> 18:30.802
assholes!

18:30.827 --> 18:32.152
Sorry.

18:34.456 --> 18:36.952
Americans have bigger
beds than us.

18:36.977 --> 18:41.152
Course, they're bigger people,
you know, the real super race.

18:41.177 --> 18:43.361
Why are they so tall?

18:43.386 --> 18:45.481
I think I shall sleep here.

18:45.506 --> 18:48.512
You're bunking with Jerry,
otherwise he'll know something's wrong.

18:50.256 --> 18:52.582
He knows anyway.
- No, he doesn't.

18:52.607 --> 18:55.002
No, and I don't want him to,
I don't want anyone to.

18:57.157 --> 18:59.361
I have to go and
brief the undersecretary.

18:59.386 --> 19:00.361
Oh, all right.

19:04.697 --> 19:05.842
No, I have...

19:14.417 --> 19:16.672
Yeah. Yes, very good.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.872
And everyone is aware the
start time is now 9:30?

19:19.897 --> 19:21.002
Yeah.

19:22.506 --> 19:23.762
Drink?

19:23.787 --> 19:26.361
I gotta get home.
Wife's pregnant.

19:26.386 --> 19:28.952
Oh congratulations, that's
wonderful. Pozdravlyayu vas.

19:31.817 --> 19:34.282
You, come on.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.551
No... This is a
momentous occasion.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.361
We drink to Bruderschaft.

19:39.466 --> 19:40.862
All right, but
just a quick one.

19:40.887 --> 19:41.782
Yes.

19:48.757 --> 19:51.802
This man, Attlee,

19:51.827 --> 19:53.672
he will be Prime Minister?

19:53.697 --> 19:55.872
I don't know.

19:55.897 --> 19:58.032
Attlee's a smart guy.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.491
He understands, if there is
another war, we are all dead.

20:04.747 --> 20:07.382
Bases in the Middle East,

20:07.407 --> 20:08.852
England does not need them.

20:13.797 --> 20:18.231
So, what, you've heard Attlee
talk about whether or not

20:18.256 --> 20:20.882
we need bases in the
Middle East?

20:20.907 --> 20:24.592
We are the little men
that try to help.

20:24.617 --> 20:27.334
We have leaders,
but it's us,

20:27.334 --> 20:30.052
the advisors,
that's trying to stop

20:30.077 --> 20:32.722
the world from going...

20:32.747 --> 20:36.672
And I'm telling you, the world
will go boom all over again,

20:36.697 --> 20:38.962
if your people on PWP committee

20:38.987 --> 20:41.882
and Palestine mandate working group...

20:41.907 --> 20:44.922
How do you know about
those committees?

20:44.947 --> 20:46.672
Stalin hears everything.

20:56.987 --> 20:58.935
I tried to move
you last night.

20:58.935 --> 21:00.882
You were immovable.

21:00.907 --> 21:03.361
I hope no-one saw you come in,
and I would appreciate it

21:03.386 --> 21:05.032
if you try to ensure
no-one saw you leave.

21:07.757 --> 21:10.132
I have to tell you
about last night.

21:10.157 --> 21:13.441
I think your priority should
be gargling and a bath.

21:13.466 --> 21:16.361
My priority is making sure
everyone has what they need

21:16.386 --> 21:19.441
for today's historic, important,
not wise to be late meetings.

21:35.935 --> 21:37.620
Are you driving the
girl home, Jerry?

21:37.645 --> 21:38.549
Mm-hm.

21:43.175 --> 21:44.219
Careful.

21:49.805 --> 21:50.910
Goodnight, Jerry.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.420
Goodnight.

22:23.255 --> 22:24.949
How'd it go?

22:28.535 --> 22:30.670
You didn't bring
Mr Roxborough in,

22:30.695 --> 22:32.590
so I assume you
got everything

22:32.615 --> 22:35.069
out of him
that you needed?

22:35.094 --> 22:35.869
No, I...

22:41.844 --> 22:44.110
Well, you and I have
both been picking locks.

22:44.135 --> 22:46.562
I got into the glove box
of Jerry's car

22:46.562 --> 22:48.989
without him seeing,
obviously,

22:49.014 --> 22:50.790
and he has a gun.

22:50.815 --> 22:52.540
Lots of people have guns.

22:52.565 --> 22:54.630
Not in England.
I think it's hot.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.869
I think we'd know more
if you brought him in.

22:58.894 --> 23:00.790
You brought someone
in right?

23:02.275 --> 23:03.380
I see the sheets.

23:07.525 --> 23:10.350
You as a beautiful woman can
get secrets much more easily

23:10.375 --> 23:12.030
out of people
than I can.

23:12.055 --> 23:14.300
It's a tremendous
advantage you have.

23:14.325 --> 23:15.590
Yes but I don't want...

23:32.295 --> 23:33.819
Don't be a little girl.

23:35.565 --> 23:36.710
Be a big girl.

23:38.695 --> 23:41.790
You have power, real power.

23:41.815 --> 23:43.829
Use it.

23:43.854 --> 23:46.286
There's no shame in it.

23:46.311 --> 23:48.880
You and Peter were lovers and
he adores you, but he'd tell

23:48.905 --> 23:50.531
you the same thing.

23:50.556 --> 23:52.090
This is the business.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.471
Peter knows what this job
requires from a woman.

23:57.496 --> 23:59.331
So don't feel
bad about it.

24:00.466 --> 24:02.010
Do what you have to do.

24:10.915 --> 24:13.811
I, erm, I found out
something else.

24:15.226 --> 24:16.411
Priscilla Garrick.

24:16.436 --> 24:18.481
I think she and Jarvis
were having an affair.

24:18.506 --> 24:19.811
When I asked her
she denied it,

24:19.836 --> 24:21.090
but she did
a little thing

24:21.115 --> 24:22.481
that made me think
she was lying.

24:22.506 --> 24:23.731
What little thing?

24:23.756 --> 24:25.121
She cleared her throat.

24:27.756 --> 24:29.278
She does that when
she's nervous,

24:29.278 --> 24:30.801
but why would
she be nervous?

24:30.826 --> 24:32.401
Maybe she knows
what happened to him?

24:32.426 --> 24:34.361
Maybe she was...

24:34.386 --> 24:35.991
...involved.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.630
But she wasn't at the meetings
where there were leaks.

24:38.655 --> 24:40.171
She wasn't listed
in the files.

24:40.196 --> 24:42.921
But Jerry was.
And maybe there's more than one spy.

24:42.946 --> 24:46.271
Cozhenko gave up 40 names in Canada.

24:46.296 --> 24:48.161
There was a whole spy ring.

24:52.546 --> 24:54.451
Let's take the investigation
up a notch.

25:01.556 --> 25:03.080
I didn't pick the lock.

25:05.266 --> 25:06.681
I have a key.

25:26.506 --> 25:27.960
Nothing?

25:27.985 --> 25:29.630
No, no secret boxes.

25:31.136 --> 25:32.720
No bugs.

25:32.745 --> 25:35.531
Place is filthy like a slum.

25:35.556 --> 25:38.241
Well, it was said he was
posing as an aristocrat.

25:38.266 --> 25:41.741
Maybe, he's a secret
member of the proletariat.

25:41.766 --> 25:42.970
Double life.

25:42.995 --> 25:44.691
Life as an agent.

25:44.716 --> 25:46.731
You know what?

25:46.756 --> 25:49.561
When Mr Roxborough gets home,

25:49.586 --> 25:51.611
why don't you ask him
a few questions?

25:51.636 --> 25:54.331
And make sure he
tells you the truth.

25:54.356 --> 25:57.041
Yeah...

25:57.066 --> 25:57.970
...OK.

26:12.156 --> 26:13.938
Rae, I wondered if
you might go out

26:13.938 --> 26:15.721
and get Mr Stevens
a cake?

26:15.746 --> 26:18.161
That's not really my job.

26:18.186 --> 26:19.071
It is today.

26:23.316 --> 26:26.531
That's how Mumsy talks
to the servants isn't it?

26:26.556 --> 26:28.811
The old girl's hitting the
garage at the weekend.

26:28.836 --> 26:30.211
They say it's a quick fix.

26:30.236 --> 26:31.964
Everybody, we're
doing a

26:31.964 --> 26:33.691
birthday surprise for
Mr Stevens at five.

26:33.716 --> 26:35.321
So I thought once
I get her back,

26:35.346 --> 26:37.241
I can take you on a
drive to the country.

26:37.266 --> 26:38.811
Or alternatively...

26:38.836 --> 26:40.991
Did you hear about the
birthday party for Mr Stevens?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.815
Yes, I think we've
told the entire office.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.019
Alternatively we could
go for a drink tonight?

26:45.044 --> 26:45.948
Or any night?

26:48.903 --> 26:52.099
Look, Jerry I'm sorry but I don't
think I should see you socially.

26:52.124 --> 26:54.229
Because of work and everything.

26:57.614 --> 27:00.149
I think it's fine for us to see
each other. We like each other.

27:00.174 --> 27:03.259
We should absolutely
socialise, you're being silly.

27:03.284 --> 27:04.669
Oops. You all right?

27:04.694 --> 27:06.179
Yes.

27:06.204 --> 27:08.149
- Nicholas Sutton.
- Feef Symmonds.

27:08.174 --> 27:09.589
After you.

27:09.614 --> 27:10.329
Thank you.

27:13.963 --> 27:16.549
The minister was quite
shocked at the devastation

27:16.574 --> 27:18.389
that he witnessed
in Russia last month.

27:18.414 --> 27:20.899
He would like to give a speech
in Parliament that articulates

27:20.924 --> 27:23.159
the extraordinary suffering
of the Russian people.

27:23.184 --> 27:25.979
He believes it would bolster
relations between our two countries

27:26.004 --> 27:28.738
which of course are currently
slightly strained as we thrash out

27:28.763 --> 27:31.109
the most practical use
of Germany's resources.

27:31.134 --> 27:33.868
Buttering up the Russians
achieves nothing.

27:33.893 --> 27:35.509
They despise you for it.

27:35.534 --> 27:37.688
I will pass on Ml5's
generality.

27:38.814 --> 27:39.818
I like the idea.

27:41.004 --> 27:42.149
I do not.

27:42.174 --> 27:44.868
Reports keep coming in that
Communists are using the Soviet zone

27:44.893 --> 27:46.379
in East Germany to recruit.

27:46.404 --> 27:48.589
De Galle stepped back,
France is now communist run.

27:48.614 --> 27:51.059
A miner strike in the US is
happening at the exact time

27:51.084 --> 27:53.269
as the miners in this country
have presented our government

27:53.294 --> 27:55.339
with a written list of demands.

27:55.364 --> 27:57.189
Workers of the world unite,
it is happening.

27:57.214 --> 27:59.319
And meanwhile they keep
asking for more information

27:59.344 --> 28:00.909
about our access
to uranium.

28:00.934 --> 28:02.539
I wouldn't butter
them up too much.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.079
So, that's a no from Ml5.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.149
We shall pass that on.

28:33.214 --> 28:35.698
Birthday surprise
for Mr Stevens.

28:35.723 --> 28:36.979
Right.

28:37.004 --> 28:38.459
Lovely gesture, Feef.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.899
Birthday surprise
for Mr Stevens.

28:43.924 --> 28:44.979
All right.

28:50.204 --> 28:51.519
Let me just get that.

28:56.614 --> 28:58.229
Hello?

28:58.254 --> 28:59.628
Have at it,
Miss Symmonds.

29:56.853 --> 29:57.789
Oh, shit...

30:05.414 --> 30:07.039
Sorry.

30:07.064 --> 30:09.029
Mr Pip the elder
ran in.

30:09.054 --> 30:10.139
I know you hate him.

30:12.174 --> 30:13.669
He opened the door?

30:13.694 --> 30:16.469
No, of course not,
you left it open a crack.

30:16.494 --> 30:18.189
Sit down.

30:18.214 --> 30:19.498
One second.

30:29.814 --> 30:32.549
May I call you back,
Mr Learning?

30:57.364 --> 30:59.559
What is the matter
with you?

31:01.894 --> 31:04.638
You tell me you need
to work for a woman.

31:04.663 --> 31:07.628
But Mr Hennessy is
all over you.

31:07.653 --> 31:09.429
You've been here less
than five minutes

31:09.454 --> 31:11.429
and you're distracting
Mr Roxborough.

31:16.983 --> 31:19.399
Women have to be twice
as good as men.

31:23.814 --> 31:24.758
They really do.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.708
Try to make yourself
look less attractive.

31:30.733 --> 31:33.599
Do you think I don't know
how to do my hair?

31:33.624 --> 31:36.389
Do you think I don't know what
rouge can do for bone structure?

31:36.414 --> 31:38.419
You think I have
no idea how to dress?

31:40.224 --> 31:41.109
Huh?

31:42.983 --> 31:45.149
It is the wrong sort
of attention.

31:54.684 --> 31:56.759
Have no private life
in the office.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.759
That's an order.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.478
And if you want
some advice,

32:00.503 --> 32:01.649
have no private
life at all.

32:04.994 --> 32:06.769
You're bright.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.818
You'd be wasted
as a wife.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.329
I don't want
to be a wife.

32:10.354 --> 32:11.708
I've never wanted
to be a wife.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.912
There is such
opportunity here.

32:14.937 --> 32:16.474
I know.

32:19.219 --> 32:19.953
Back to work.

32:28.169 --> 32:30.344
My mother's
just a wife.

32:30.369 --> 32:31.713
Now she drinks
too much.

32:34.809 --> 32:35.753
I admire you.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.854
It's a ridiculous plan.

32:46.879 --> 32:49.503
I arrange a cake, then I'm not
there when they present it.

32:49.528 --> 32:50.674
Because your phone rang.

32:50.699 --> 32:51.774
She almost caught me.

32:51.799 --> 32:54.344
But she didn't,
because you had a plan.

32:54.369 --> 32:57.784
You had a cover story, that
was a brilliant use of a cat.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.963
If I get fired,
I'm no good to you.

32:59.988 --> 33:01.864
Then don't get fired.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.194
I met someone today.

33:05.219 --> 33:07.114
His name is Nicholas Sullivan,
he's Ml5

33:07.139 --> 33:09.674
and I want to tell him
what's going on.

33:09.699 --> 33:13.304
He's very anti-Russia and I
think I or you or both of us...

33:13.329 --> 33:15.274
Absolutely not.

33:15.299 --> 33:17.344
Why? We're all
on the same side.

33:17.369 --> 33:20.344
Ml5 or MI6 are
either incompetent

33:20.369 --> 33:22.674
or they've been infiltrated.

33:22.699 --> 33:24.703
I don't think Mr Sullivan
has been compromised,

33:24.728 --> 33:26.424
you should have heard him
at this meeting.

33:26.449 --> 33:28.664
He was very clear about not
buttering up to the Russians.

33:28.689 --> 33:30.664
And I thought...
- You thought, what,

33:30.689 --> 33:32.904
you'd go up to him
and say, "Hi, I'm a spy?

33:32.929 --> 33:35.211
"I've been secretly
reporting on my

33:35.211 --> 33:37.493
countrymen to an
American agent?"

33:40.239 --> 33:44.474
You will tell no-one who
you are or what we're doing.

33:46.319 --> 33:47.134
Or what?

33:50.939 --> 33:54.034
Believe it or not,
I'm trying to keep you safe.

33:54.059 --> 33:56.583
You're not doing a
very good job.

33:56.608 --> 33:57.394
I don't feel safe.

33:58.689 --> 33:59.664
Only idiots feel safe.

34:20.174 --> 34:23.349
I was with someone else
before I met you.

34:23.373 --> 34:25.420
An American.

34:25.445 --> 34:27.820
I hope you don't
mind me saying.

34:27.844 --> 34:31.139
No. I did...
I did care about him.

34:33.373 --> 34:35.179
I'm not sure
how nice he was.

34:36.685 --> 34:39.349
Nice is so boring.

34:40.965 --> 34:42.139
Yes, I know.

34:44.324 --> 34:45.659
But it's also nice.

36:28.335 --> 36:30.310
What you doing, man?
Don't do that.

36:51.845 --> 36:53.510
Oh, God.

36:56.325 --> 36:57.330
It's all right.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.790
Is there someone
I can call for you?

37:05.365 --> 37:06.979
No family?

37:07.004 --> 37:08.350
Nothing?

37:08.375 --> 37:10.260
Lost my brothers
in the war.

37:11.725 --> 37:13.180
I should be dead too.

37:15.845 --> 37:17.979
Had to separate myself
from the pack, didn't I?

37:19.535 --> 37:21.610
Get yourself to university
and the next thing you know

37:21.635 --> 37:24.149
you're too important
to fight.

37:27.205 --> 37:28.580
It doesn't matter.

37:30.205 --> 37:31.870
They always thought
I was up myself.

37:33.815 --> 37:36.109
That's what they'd say,
down the East End.

37:37.655 --> 37:40.229
It's just something
I've been doing.

37:40.254 --> 37:42.950
Sitting in the car
with a gun.

37:42.975 --> 37:45.050
Because.

37:45.075 --> 37:47.310
I mean, sometimes the world
gets very dark.

37:49.645 --> 37:51.750
Do you ever have that
feeling sometimes?

37:54.825 --> 37:55.899
I wouldn't do it.

37:57.645 --> 38:00.229
But if I did do it, I wouldn't want
the landlady to have to clear up.

38:02.895 --> 38:04.019
The darkness?

38:04.044 --> 38:05.540
Yes.

38:05.565 --> 38:07.149
Yes, it's awful,
isn't it?

38:09.495 --> 38:12.820
What I figured out is the
Party can always help.

38:12.845 --> 38:15.340
Huh? Oh, yes.

38:15.365 --> 38:18.109
Yes, a party does help
sometimes, absolutely.

38:18.134 --> 38:20.680
There's lots of
pretty girls.

38:20.705 --> 38:21.950
No...

38:23.254 --> 38:24.630
The Party.

38:24.655 --> 38:25.950
The Communist Party.

38:27.485 --> 38:28.789
No.

38:28.814 --> 38:30.109
No.

38:31.615 --> 38:33.520
No! Not my cup of tea.

38:35.054 --> 38:37.390
They'd always come knocking,
looking for converts

38:37.415 --> 38:38.789
when we were growing up.

38:38.814 --> 38:41.260
My mother would shut
the door on them.

38:41.285 --> 38:45.109
"I'm not voting for no
stinking Jew Commie."

38:45.134 --> 38:47.070
Very proud woman,
my mother.

39:02.054 --> 39:03.802
Last weekend's
performance was good

39:03.802 --> 39:05.550
but if we want to
knock their socks

39:05.575 --> 39:07.899
off this weekend,
I need better enunciation.

39:52.425 --> 39:55.950
I just wanted to have a quick word
with you about Miss Simmons.

39:55.975 --> 39:58.779
I'm just curious about why
she wanted to leave housing.

40:00.134 --> 40:02.600
You said you wanted her.

40:02.625 --> 40:04.989
She told me you were
taking liberties with her.

40:06.975 --> 40:09.957
But I think that's very unlikely
so I just wanted to discuss it.

40:16.796 --> 40:18.592
Why do you think
it's unlikely?

40:20.207 --> 40:22.231
You just don't seem
like the type.

40:25.987 --> 40:29.192
Look, she's a very
attractive girl.

40:31.056 --> 40:33.742
I probably, er...

40:33.767 --> 40:36.332
I took my interest
in her too far.

40:36.357 --> 40:39.101
I apologise.
I'll apologise to her.

40:39.126 --> 40:41.412
She's just very pretty.

40:44.126 --> 40:45.692
And I like pretty girls.

40:47.287 --> 40:48.702
Are you coming, David?

41:08.977 --> 41:12.332
Well, Mr Roxborough
is leading a double life.

41:12.357 --> 41:14.192
But not one of a spy.

41:17.087 --> 41:18.981
There is something
we're missing here.

41:24.077 --> 41:26.502
I need to take
another look.

41:26.527 --> 41:27.752
Thank you.

42:00.767 --> 42:03.352
They want the King's speech to
commit to the nationalization

42:03.377 --> 42:06.502
of inland transport services,
electricity and fuel and power

42:06.527 --> 42:09.542
and health services
in the next year.

42:09.567 --> 42:11.942
We simply have to advise that's
too much for the next year.

42:14.567 --> 42:15.752
Excuse me?

42:20.136 --> 42:23.422
I have to say, I think
you're very nice girl.

42:23.447 --> 42:26.981
And I won't take no
for an answer.

42:27.006 --> 42:27.981
Jerry...

42:32.167 --> 42:35.242
Look, I'm sorry. I've started
going with someone. - What?

42:36.977 --> 42:39.632
So you just wanted
a ride in my car?

42:39.657 --> 42:41.981
And I asked you that
directly and you lied.

42:42.006 --> 42:45.121
I'm so sorry. Things
just... changed.

42:46.256 --> 42:47.752
Little girls...

42:49.597 --> 42:52.062
...who want a ride
in a nice car...

42:52.087 --> 42:55.472
...should be very careful about
giving the driver the eye -

42:55.497 --> 42:56.712
and a flash of the leg...

42:58.657 --> 43:01.222
...lest the driver
get the wrong idea.

43:43.926 --> 43:45.101
Can I tell you a secret?

43:47.136 --> 43:48.942
Of course.

43:48.967 --> 43:50.622
Because it's torturing me.

43:53.167 --> 43:55.832
Now, you'll think I'm crazy.

43:55.857 --> 43:58.324
But I think that
the Russians have

43:58.324 --> 44:00.791
placed a fellow
in our department.

44:06.087 --> 44:07.352
You're crazy.

44:07.377 --> 44:09.712
And I think it's Roxborough.

44:09.737 --> 44:12.350
Or Stevens, but
I can't bring

44:12.350 --> 44:14.962
myself to say
anything to anybody

44:14.987 --> 44:18.031
because, I mean, Christ, the idea that
- these are good men.

44:19.217 --> 44:20.781
I just...

44:20.806 --> 44:22.062
I can't believe it.

44:29.787 --> 44:31.222
Now, now.

44:33.317 --> 44:36.182
What's happening in
your eyes, there, missus?

44:44.537 --> 44:45.712
It's nothing.

44:49.016 --> 44:50.192
Just...

44:51.087 --> 44:52.861
...why aren't we safe anywhere?

45:09.387 --> 45:11.952
He doesn't want to
say anything anyway.

45:11.977 --> 45:13.432
And he's not on to me but...

45:14.886 --> 45:17.222
Well, I think I should
mention it. - Yes.

45:20.577 --> 45:22.991
So what do I do?
- I'll take it from here.

45:29.136 --> 45:31.302
Please.
- Please what?

45:34.577 --> 45:35.942
Please.

45:46.936 --> 45:49.712
It's nothing for you to
worry about, Comrade.
