01:26.128 --> 01:28.255
Every world has ghosts.

01:29.173 --> 01:31.258
And every house is haunted by them.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.721
Even the palace of the Empire.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.558
Especially the palace of the Empire.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.272
Where have you been?

01:45.355 --> 01:47.274
With the systems programmers.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.860
Lately you've been with them
more than with me.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.529
You've set them a large task.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.575
Should we look to replace them?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.910
They'll see it through.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.997
I can count on you, Demerzel?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.416
To see it through?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.126
Of course, Cleon.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.419
And not just that.

02:08.753 --> 02:09.755
Everything.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.925
I always assumed
you'd stay on after I was gone.

02:13.008 --> 02:17.554
But it occurred to me,
in the near-darkness of my life…

02:19.598 --> 02:21.391
I shouldn't take anything for granted.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.977
I'm loyal to the Empire.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.689
Yes, but will the Empire be loyal to you?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.568
It hasn't always shown
benevolence to your kind.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.489
You're becoming sentimental,
verging on maudlin.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.784
Well, I'm dying.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.955
And I'm leaving everything in pieces.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.332
Are you unhappy with your successor?

02:47.251 --> 02:50.420
We can still revisit
the idea of marriage and an heir.

02:50.504 --> 02:55.884
Demerzel, for all you are,
and maybe because of it…

02:58.262 --> 02:59.721
there are things you will never know.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.723
I may someday know death.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.517
Yes.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.020
But I doubt you will feel
it arrived too soon.

03:11.066 --> 03:14.194
I should have seen
the completion of the Star Bridge.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.658
Me. My mind. My eyes.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.913
We should have ridden up
to the orbital platform together

03:24.997 --> 03:27.416
and looked down on all that we had made.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.127
And one day we will.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.631
Your continuity is assured.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.474
-Do you think of him often?
-You know the way I am.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.478
I don't forget anything or anyone.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.149
Empire is always on my mind.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.986
The platform's orbit
is dying at an accelerated rate.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.533
Or so say the physicists,
who worry it'll just fall on their heads.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.493
Their job is to worry over those things.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.078
Is it not ours?

04:10.417 --> 04:13.921
Perhaps it is still yours,
but no longer mine,

04:15.172 --> 04:16.673
as it is no longer his.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.551
How you spend this last day is up to you.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.387
Every one of you is different.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.265
Somehow I doubt that.

04:26.183 --> 04:30.771
But thank you for trying to make me
feel unique as I shuffle off the stage.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.194
It was hardest on him.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.489
He only had the infant Dawn
to place on the throne.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.741
A baby with his eyes.

04:44.326 --> 04:48.664
Identical in every respect,
but a baby nonetheless.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.251
When I think of him, that's what I think.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.420
He also had you.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.718
Please see Master Ilan, Empire.
He's waiting for your final fitting.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.865
Shall we?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.997
The details, they're perfect.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.878
For the pick stitching?

05:35.961 --> 05:37.504
The jade, I think.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.013
Shoo, shoo.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.442
I am sorry, Empire.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.776
I have lost weight.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.987
-I am sure your frame is--
-I am shrinking.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.824
The world is beginning to see me
from a distance.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.244
The garment is singular, Ilan.

06:10.621 --> 06:14.833
It will be a privilege
to wear it at my ascension.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.002
Thank you, Empire.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.796
-Shall we finish the job?
-Oh.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.138
Ilan, let's let the girl have the stage.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.658
Brother Dusk? I didn't know you'd be here.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.249
Anacreon. Thespis.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.918
I wonder if you will speak of them
after I'm gone.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.754
We have broken the barbarians.
Cast them adrift.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.924
What would you have us say
that you haven't said?

07:04.007 --> 07:08.262
I don't know. I'm still trying to decide
what to say that I haven't said.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.596
About the Outer Reach?

07:09.680 --> 07:15.394
About anything. About whether any of this
is truly within our power to control.

07:15.477 --> 07:20.315
However many words I have left,
I would hate to waste them.

07:20.399 --> 07:22.526
You waste them
when you speak of the Outer Reach.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.861
I speak of Seldon.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.945
A man long dead.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.656
And soon forgotten.

07:27.739 --> 07:31.285
Does that mean his words
have no more worth in this Empire?

07:31.368 --> 07:33.787
Brother, the Empire is strong--

07:37.833 --> 07:40.169
Cleon I's legacy.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.005
I wonder if there's a way to save it.

07:43.088 --> 07:46.466
Stabilize it with propulsive lifts?
Push it out into the heavens?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.218
To what end?

07:48.302 --> 07:53.015
To the end that we not destroy
the last remnants of Cleon I's dream

07:53.599 --> 07:55.017
for lack of our own.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.650
Brother Dusk.

08:05.402 --> 08:10.824
We are the great dream of Cleon I,
not the Star Bridge.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.874
The dreamer.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.463
The scholar.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.758
The alchemist.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.347
And me.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.366
I've tried my whole life,

08:53.033 --> 08:56.620
but I don't think I've ever been able
to make that face.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.708
Come. Your brothers have your last gift.

09:02.668 --> 09:07.047
I would like to thank you, Brothers,
for this beautiful meal.

09:07.548 --> 09:11.260
I can taste the care
you put into each bite.

09:11.885 --> 09:17.474
Your time and your attention
is deeply appreciated.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.893
You're very welcome, Brother.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.729
But this is not the gift.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.776
Welcome to Trantor, the eye of the Empire.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.737
It's been so long.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.157
He was glorious, wasn't he?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.909
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

10:16.992 --> 10:18.118
Indeed.

10:18.869 --> 10:22.623
And we will build something greater
in his honor. For you.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.628
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

11:58.635 --> 12:02.431
You can't be here. You know that.

12:02.514 --> 12:07.019
I can't be the first one
who wanted to see my youngest self.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.062
Which is why we made the rule.

12:09.146 --> 12:12.733
I've never heard that song before.
Or have I?

12:18.780 --> 12:21.491
No wonder the Empire loves you so.

12:23.493 --> 12:28.332
I find I cannot quite look on that child
as an innocent.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.833
Even if Seldon wasn't right…

12:32.085 --> 12:34.129
there is something unnatural in that.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.424
You must go.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.135
You should rest.

12:50.646 --> 12:54.066
Strange, watching yourself being born.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.557
Sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.267
I saw you tonight…

14:11.185 --> 14:14.438
watching our first brother
in the old Star Bridge.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.191
Are we not enough?

14:19.193 --> 14:21.236
Is that why you miss him?

14:23.614 --> 14:25.574
Oh, no, sweet brother.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.368
You are enough.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.885
It's just that you always leave me.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.397
You have grown into our greatness,

15:39.523 --> 15:43.026
Brother Dawn, now Day.

15:56.582 --> 15:59.960
Thank you, Brother Dusk.

16:12.556 --> 16:15.851
And the new Dawn, just awoken.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.563
You have a long, beautiful day ahead.

16:25.736 --> 16:28.614
Brother Darkness, it's time.

16:44.213 --> 16:45.964
The dream lives on in you.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.134
Because you kept it alive in you.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.573
Shh. It's okay.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.204
You're all right.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.874
Everything is all right.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.003
No.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.425
Something's wrong.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.237
Demerzel.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.533
I don't forget anything or anyone.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.579
Empire is always on my mind.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.041
Shh.

19:04.019 --> 19:06.522
To be alive is to know ghosts.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.614
We hear their whispers if we listen.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.454
We are haunted by prophets, all.

19:26.041 --> 19:29.628
Are you certain you want it erased,
Brother Dawn?

19:29.711 --> 19:30.712
Yes.

19:31.547 --> 19:32.548
I've outgrown it.

19:38.637 --> 19:41.098
We ignore the dead at our peril.

19:45.519 --> 19:48.856
And as Empire cycled through
a generation of Cleons,

19:48.939 --> 19:51.567
the Foundation began colonizing Terminus.

19:52.985 --> 19:56.321
The Empire underestimated Hari.
We all did.

19:58.031 --> 20:01.994
Hari had predicted the Cleons would opt
for exile over execution…

20:03.996 --> 20:06.748
that his followers' end point
would be Terminus.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.765
Every aspect of their arrival
was predetermined…

20:27.769 --> 20:29.605
when the colonists would land…

20:32.941 --> 20:34.902
where they would build their outpost.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.671
So imagine their surprise

20:54.755 --> 20:58.759
when they discovered that
something else was already there.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.431
What in Seldon's name is that?

21:26.537 --> 21:28.121
It wasn't in the surveys.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.706
Should we go back?

21:29.790 --> 21:32.918
Go back where, Mari?
This was always a one-way journey.

21:33.669 --> 21:36.755
-I'll check it out.
-No. We go together.

21:44.930 --> 21:46.765
Lowre, are you all right?

21:46.849 --> 21:47.933
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Come on.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.394
-I'm just a little light-headed.
-Come on.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.275
Get back.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.654
Abbas! Get back.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.918
It became known as the Vault.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.672
And over the decades,
countless myths grew up around it.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.760
It was an ancient artifact left by aliens…

22:26.513 --> 22:29.183
a surveillance outpost
sent ahead by the Cleons.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.520
All the settlers knew for certain

22:33.604 --> 22:37.191
was that the Vault wouldn't allow
anyone to approach it.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.819
And so they kept away.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.961
The slow ship was scuttled…

22:59.796 --> 23:01.673
a refuge built from its bones.

23:06.553 --> 23:10.390
And what was once mysterious
became mundane.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.190
Her teachers say she's difficult.

23:19.483 --> 23:20.567
She's an outsider.

23:22.152 --> 23:23.278
Good.

23:23.362 --> 23:25.239
You're not listening to me, Abbas.

23:25.906 --> 23:26.907
She's a dreamer.

23:28.158 --> 23:30.202
She's distracted.

23:32.037 --> 23:33.914
She's a thinker, like you.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.585
She's not distracted.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.088
She's aware.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.008
Just look at her. She's fascinated by it.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.306
It's pretty.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.142
It's dangerous.

23:54.226 --> 23:56.019
What do you think's inside it?

23:56.103 --> 23:57.980
We don't know.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.982
Then how do you know it's dangerous?

24:06.488 --> 24:07.489
Come on.

25:16.058 --> 25:17.059
There you go.

25:18.936 --> 25:19.937
Get away.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.067
One of these days you'll get me,
and you'll be so sorry.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.235
You're looking good.

26:08.318 --> 26:09.736
Yeah, coordinated.

26:09.820 --> 26:12.030
-Which parts?
-Right boot with left boot.

26:12.114 --> 26:13.657
How did I miss that?

26:14.491 --> 26:16.326
How goes the wild work?

26:16.410 --> 26:18.370
Just got back from
patrolling the highlands.

26:18.453 --> 26:21.415
Lichen beds are shrinking.
Ice lunes are already heading south.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.375
Means we're gonna have a nice warm spring.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.710
Tell me you don't miss it.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.421
What, the stench of sulfur?

26:28.714 --> 26:29.715
And the frostbite?

26:29.798 --> 26:33.218
Nah, being a warden suits you
a lot better than it ever did me.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.514
Wow. That's a big one, hey?

26:37.598 --> 26:42.227
Yeah. Bishop's claw, female.
Maybe 600 kilos.

26:42.311 --> 26:45.230
She's been testing the fence
late at night the last few weeks.

26:45.314 --> 26:48.525
I'm gonna call her Maybel. She's a loner.

26:50.402 --> 26:53.572
Salvor, why have you got me out here
at this time in the morning, huh?

26:55.616 --> 26:58.702
I know when my daughter's procrastinating.
Come on.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.788
I did a little test.

27:03.832 --> 27:06.585
Something's wrong with the null field.

27:07.169 --> 27:08.962
And what made you check it now?

27:09.046 --> 27:10.464
I don't know. A feeling?

27:11.924 --> 27:13.759
I checked it out. I got evidence.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.719
Of course. And have you told her yet?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.137
Wanted you to know first.

27:17.221 --> 27:20.307
I appreciate that.
But it is for her to know.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.894
And stress the evidence part.

27:55.092 --> 27:57.427
Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Seldon,

27:57.511 --> 28:00.180
Cleon XII established our refuge…

28:00.264 --> 28:03.809
In terms of timekeeping, the water clock
is the more precise instrument.

28:03.892 --> 28:08.438
Right. But it also requires water
to work, doesn't it?

28:08.522 --> 28:09.815
Well, obviously.

28:09.898 --> 28:12.150
What happens when the water runs out,
Novice Jord?

28:12.234 --> 28:16.113
For a sundial, all you need is the gnomon.
That's the blade sticking out of it.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.073
And, of course… the sun.

28:19.324 --> 28:25.455
Hari Seldon entrusted us with rebuilding
civilization after the collapse.

28:25.539 --> 28:26.748
We can't assume anything.

28:26.832 --> 28:29.251
Whether or not our future survivors
will be able to read,

28:29.334 --> 28:30.627
or what language they'll speak.

28:30.711 --> 28:33.589
We don't even know
what worlds they'll be scattered upon.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.384
What if they find themselves
on Cygnus Prime,

28:38.010 --> 28:41.221
where the only moisture to be gained
is from weeping vines?

28:41.305 --> 28:45.142
So, yes, this water clock is more precise,

28:46.185 --> 28:47.853
but the sundial is more practical.

28:47.936 --> 28:51.690
We can't provide for every condition
or contingency our descendants will face.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.234
By the same token,
we can't preserve every innovation,

28:54.318 --> 28:56.528
so we have to choose and keep choosing.

28:58.363 --> 28:59.907
Until the fall comes.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.326
I'd have picked the water clock.

29:02.409 --> 29:05.078
And you could have,
if you were still training here.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.663
Sorry, that was--

29:06.747 --> 29:08.290
I know you're suited to where you are,

29:08.373 --> 29:10.459
keeping us safe,
making sure the Foundation survives--

29:10.542 --> 29:12.336
I'm making sure you survive.
The Foundation--

29:12.419 --> 29:14.338
It's the same thing.
We are the Foundation.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.549
I am not.
But you believe. And that is fine.

29:17.633 --> 29:19.468
No. Do not make this sound like a cult.

29:19.551 --> 29:22.804
Some of us in our generation know
what real religious fervor looks like.

29:22.888 --> 29:25.265
Do you even wanna know
what I came to tell you?

29:30.479 --> 29:32.439
You know I don't like being near it.

29:32.523 --> 29:35.651
Dad said you'd want evidence, and this
you gotta experience for yourself.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.113
The null field is expanding.

29:41.448 --> 29:44.618
The field used to start there.
Now it starts here.

29:46.453 --> 29:49.498
If it keeps expanding,
we might need to clear out the town.

30:15.816 --> 30:17.776
I remember the first time
I found you out here.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.821
Four years old, middle of the night,

30:21.697 --> 30:25.117
standing right under it
like it was… nothing.

30:27.578 --> 30:29.663
And you wouldn't turn
when I called your name.

30:30.247 --> 30:32.291
Yeah, I thought it was calling to me.

30:32.374 --> 30:33.458
The ghost.

30:35.294 --> 30:36.628
Like an imaginary friend.

30:38.297 --> 30:41.466
I lay on the ground and tried to crawl
to you, but the pain was too great.

30:41.550 --> 30:42.885
You just…

30:44.970 --> 30:46.054
looked at me.

30:47.848 --> 30:51.852
I couldn't understand
why the Vault was hurting you but not me.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.604
You're special, Salvor.

30:54.897 --> 30:56.106
You always have been.

30:58.609 --> 30:59.985
Then why keep it a secret?

31:03.071 --> 31:05.407
Your father and I didn't want
people treating you differently.

31:05.490 --> 31:09.077
Yeah, but they do, Mom. They always have.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.415
I make them uncomfortable.

31:14.124 --> 31:15.375
Just like the Vault.

31:15.459 --> 31:17.002
Is it calling to you now?

31:19.505 --> 31:20.547
Not in words.

31:21.882 --> 31:23.217
Make your case.

31:26.053 --> 31:27.304
I think it's waking up.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.681
You and the other encyclopedists,

31:29.765 --> 31:33.769
you've been preparing for
some distant crisis.

31:36.563 --> 31:37.814
But I think it's here.

31:39.024 --> 31:40.025
Now.

31:43.529 --> 31:46.114
Gia! Keir! Guys, Hugo's here!

31:46.740 --> 31:49.910
-Hugo's here!
-Hugo's here! Hugo's here, come on.

31:50.577 --> 31:52.746
-Hugo's here!
-Come on, Hugo!

31:52.829 --> 31:54.540
-Hugo!
-Hugo!

31:54.623 --> 31:56.583
Hugo!

31:56.667 --> 31:58.627
Whoa. Look at that! Come on.

32:06.093 --> 32:09.012
-Cut through this way!
-Whoa. Hey, now. Hey!

32:09.096 --> 32:10.973
-Oh, you can't get me.
-Through here.

32:11.056 --> 32:14.142
Come on, guys. Come on.
Hurry up! Let's go!

32:14.226 --> 32:16.270
Poly, come on! Hurry up!

32:16.895 --> 32:19.106
Hugo! Hugo!

32:22.860 --> 32:24.820
-Hugo!
-Hugo!

32:24.903 --> 32:26.113
Four-sworn, Hugo!

32:26.196 --> 32:29.491
Gentlemen, ladies.
What can I do for you grown adults?

32:29.575 --> 32:30.951
Got anything for us?

32:31.910 --> 32:34.413
Korellian chocolate. Knock yourselves out.

32:34.913 --> 32:37.624
We don't want chocolate.
How about some beer?

32:37.708 --> 32:40.752
How about you come back and see me
when you got hair on your chest?

32:40.836 --> 32:42.629
And don't come begging for it
like wayward puppies.

32:42.713 --> 32:44.965
We're not begging. We're… trading.

32:45.048 --> 32:46.967
Is that so? What for what?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.845
How about our sparkling wit and company?

32:50.470 --> 32:51.471
Hard pass.

32:54.016 --> 32:55.017
Tell you what.

32:56.185 --> 32:58.187
If you clowns could help me load out,

32:58.270 --> 33:01.148
I might be able to scrounge up something
a little more age-appropriate for you.

33:01.231 --> 33:02.941
Deal. I'll do it.

33:03.025 --> 33:04.109
We all will.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.194
Go on then.

33:05.277 --> 33:06.695
-Come on, guys.
-Come on.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.780
-Keir, catch. Poly.
-I'm here.

33:22.461 --> 33:23.545
That smells terrible.

33:24.129 --> 33:26.798
It should. It's sealant for my gum boots.

33:26.882 --> 33:28.008
More onions than I expected.

33:29.134 --> 33:30.844
I may have used the wrong recipe.

33:30.928 --> 33:32.596
That would be a tragic mishap.

33:34.681 --> 33:35.766
It'll keep.

33:37.726 --> 33:38.769
What's wrong?

33:39.603 --> 33:40.896
There's a man in my kitchen.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.318
How long are you here?

33:47.152 --> 33:49.404
Twenty-nine long hours.

33:51.198 --> 33:53.075
And how's the rest of the galaxy?

33:53.158 --> 33:54.159
Oh, it's big.

33:54.868 --> 33:56.286
You should see it sometime.

33:57.412 --> 33:58.413
Should I?

34:09.049 --> 34:10.300
Irina Four.

34:11.385 --> 34:13.512
Only one continent,
but it's tropical all over.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.848
It's got bugs the size of dogs
and just as cuddly.

34:17.099 --> 34:19.184
Dropped off medicine, I picked up fruit.

34:19.268 --> 34:21.687
Such is the itinerant life
of the wayward purveyor.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.690
-Where'd you take the fruit?
-To Hesperus.

34:24.773 --> 34:27.234
Which you could describe
as well as me by now.

34:27.317 --> 34:31.112
But I was off on a whirlwind tour
of this little cluster.

34:32.447 --> 34:34.533
Once they started trading,
they couldn't stop.

34:34.616 --> 34:38.495
Little rectangular situation
of workers and sugar, rum, cash.

34:40.121 --> 34:43.292
You think you've got a handful of moons,
you should see what they got.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.460
The sky looks like spilled coins.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.295
-Spilled coins?
-Mm-hmm.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.839
I'd love to see that.

34:48.922 --> 34:51.842
Well, you need to go.
Get off this ball of ice.

34:53.177 --> 34:56.221
-I've got responsibilities here.
-Oh, but you didn't pick them.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.098
Nah, they're still mine. And…

34:59.933 --> 35:02.436
Is it possible to know you've got reasons
and not know what they are?

35:02.519 --> 35:04.396
Reasons you're important to this place?

35:05.397 --> 35:07.649
It's possible.
A little egotistical, but possible.

35:07.733 --> 35:10.068
I didn't say I was important.
I said I can't leave.

35:13.113 --> 35:15.616
Speaking of leaving,
would you like dinner now or after?

35:17.242 --> 35:18.243
After sounds good.

36:16.385 --> 36:17.636
What are you doing?

36:19.596 --> 36:20.597
Is something wrong?

36:21.974 --> 36:24.893
Just a weird feeling.
I'm gonna walk the perimeter.

36:24.977 --> 36:27.688
What, because that's
where the weird feeling is coming from?

36:27.771 --> 36:29.189
No, that is in here.

36:30.399 --> 36:31.692
This is just a walk.

36:31.775 --> 36:35.279
So if I said,
"Let me get my pants," you'd say?

36:35.362 --> 36:39.157
No pants for the next 25 hours.

36:42.578 --> 36:44.746
-Will you be mad later?
-Never.

37:05.392 --> 37:06.810
What are you doing out there?

37:09.813 --> 37:10.981
Stop!

37:18.071 --> 37:20.574
Stop. It's after curfew.

37:38.300 --> 37:40.969
Hello? Hello?

38:13.335 --> 38:14.336
Who are you?

39:06.513 --> 39:07.681
What the hell?

39:08.432 --> 39:09.933
I heard a shot. What's up?

39:10.017 --> 39:12.561
Am I crazy, or is that ship Anacreon?

39:17.816 --> 39:19.484
Oh, you're crazy.

39:19.568 --> 39:20.777
But not about that.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.580
And then there are three.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.416
-Hail them.
-We already have. No answer.

39:34.499 --> 39:36.543
And they're ignoring our approach vectors.

39:36.627 --> 39:38.504
Should we send one of our shuttles
to meet them?

39:38.587 --> 39:39.880
Your unarmed shuttles?

39:40.964 --> 39:43.342
Those are corvettes. Gunships.

39:43.425 --> 39:44.718
Why is he here?

39:44.801 --> 39:46.803
Because he knows what gunships look like.

39:46.887 --> 39:48.222
Also, he's Thespin.

39:48.305 --> 39:49.681
Been off-world since the bombings.

39:50.349 --> 39:51.850
Impossible. That would make you--

39:51.934 --> 39:55.270
Pushing 70. But I spent half that
cryosleeping between ports.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.065
When you tow freight to Anacreon,
it pays to be blood-neutral.

39:58.148 --> 40:01.652
-Anacreon is under imperial sanction.
-Grow up, Lewis.

40:01.735 --> 40:04.696
Maybe it's a mistake.
Maybe they wandered off course.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.698
They're literally trying to sneak in
under our radar.

40:06.782 --> 40:09.868
We are a scientific outpost.
We have nothing of value here.

40:09.952 --> 40:12.496
Mayor, have the Anacreons
ever made landfall here before?

40:12.579 --> 40:15.415
No Anacreons, no Thespins.
No one in 30 years.

40:15.499 --> 40:18.293
Under imperial edict,
Terminus is off-limit to all of them.

40:18.377 --> 40:19.962
It's gotta be connected to the Vault.

40:20.045 --> 40:21.338
What?

40:22.256 --> 40:24.049
The null field's expanding.

40:24.132 --> 40:25.467
-I noticed it yesterday.
-How fast?

40:25.551 --> 40:27.302
The next day, the Anacreons showed up.

40:27.386 --> 40:29.930
Technically, we are an imperial outpost.

40:30.013 --> 40:33.392
And Lord knows the Anacreons have
a bone to pick with the Empire.

40:33.475 --> 40:35.602
Are you suggesting
the Vault might be an Anacreon--

40:35.686 --> 40:38.021
I'm suggesting the Vault knew something
and reacted.

40:38.105 --> 40:39.356
Maybe it even warned us.

40:39.439 --> 40:44.653
Are you saying the Vault was signaling you
because you're somehow, what, special?

40:45.237 --> 40:47.364
Salvor is an outlier.

40:47.447 --> 40:50.075
We need to think whether the Plan
could have possibly predicted--

40:50.158 --> 40:51.451
Forget the Plan.

40:51.535 --> 40:52.703
Seldon's gone.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.706
When are any of you
gonna start thinking for yourselves?

40:55.789 --> 40:59.001
All right, that's enough.
We don't need to make this complicated.

40:59.084 --> 41:03.422
The Anacreons have ignored our hails,
and they are violating imperial aerospace.

41:03.505 --> 41:05.424
Our course of action is obvious.

41:05.507 --> 41:07.301
We'll uplink to the communications buoy

41:07.384 --> 41:09.595
as soon as we hit
the next rotational window.

41:10.179 --> 41:12.973
We'll call the Empire, and they will come.

41:14.308 --> 41:15.767
Where are you going?

41:15.851 --> 41:17.186
To check out the armory.

41:18.854 --> 41:21.231
If the Anacreons come knocking
before the Empire,

41:21.315 --> 41:23.901
I'd like to know what kind of violence
we can muster.

41:25.027 --> 41:26.778
When was the last time
these were broken down?

41:26.862 --> 41:29.531
-So we're a little complacent.
-I've got an ion pistol, if that helps.

41:29.615 --> 41:31.533
Mom, anything we could use
in the curation stores?

41:31.617 --> 41:34.203
A few hand axes,
a shepherd's sling from Weaver's World.

41:34.286 --> 41:36.455
-I should've been on top of this.
-Not your job.

41:36.538 --> 41:39.166
-No? I keep you safe, remember?
-Come on. Come on.

41:39.249 --> 41:41.710
Generally I propose alcohol
at a juncture like this.

41:42.711 --> 41:44.254
Rotational window's open.

41:45.172 --> 41:47.841
Handshake protocol.
It just takes a few seconds.

42:00.646 --> 42:01.813
What's wrong?

42:01.897 --> 42:05.108
Comms buoy's not responding
to any of our pings. It's gone dark.

42:05.901 --> 42:07.110
Use another one then.

42:07.194 --> 42:08.487
There isn't another one.

42:08.570 --> 42:09.780
So, what does that mean?

42:10.364 --> 42:11.865
We can't contact the Empire.

42:14.117 --> 42:16.537
Well, keep trying. Don't panic.

42:16.620 --> 42:19.873
Could be something as simple as
a meteor shower. It'll clear.

42:20.749 --> 42:22.501
On the heels of an Anacreon flyby?

42:23.460 --> 42:26.004
Assuming the Anacreons
intend landfall here,

42:26.088 --> 42:27.506
how long before they arrive?

42:27.589 --> 42:31.051
Based on their current approach,
I'd say another 40 hours.

42:38.475 --> 42:39.476
Mom.

43:15.429 --> 43:16.430
Whoa.

43:18.557 --> 43:19.558
What is that?

43:21.518 --> 43:22.811
Psychohistory.

43:23.937 --> 43:26.773
All of Hari's work
expressed as a mathematical equation.

43:27.441 --> 43:29.860
I took it from his office
the night after his funeral.

43:30.986 --> 43:33.697
His numbers are the basis
for why we do what we do.

43:34.781 --> 43:37.910
On the ship, there were two people
who could actually understand it.

43:37.993 --> 43:39.453
Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick.

43:46.251 --> 43:47.628
Can you make anything of it?

43:47.711 --> 43:49.463
Me? No, not likely.

43:50.047 --> 43:53.759
Salvor, if you were part of the Plan,

43:54.343 --> 43:57.262
it would make it a lot easier
for me to believe in all this.

44:31.547 --> 44:33.298
Yeah, well, big surprise.

44:34.550 --> 44:35.592
It was worth a shot.

44:35.676 --> 44:36.927
Was it?

44:37.594 --> 44:39.638
I told you,
different's not the same as special.

44:59.157 --> 45:00.576
Comms buoy is down.

45:02.327 --> 45:03.954
That is an ominous happenstance.

45:04.663 --> 45:06.248
You should probably hightail it.

45:08.458 --> 45:09.459
Oh, yeah?

45:11.211 --> 45:14.923
The Anacreons will be here in two days.
Maybe less.

45:15.424 --> 45:17.467
You would be safer anywhere but here.

45:18.552 --> 45:20.637
The scenery is so beautiful
this time of year.

45:21.346 --> 45:23.682
Vast wastelands of frozen lune shit.

45:23.765 --> 45:24.975
I'm serious, Hugo.

45:25.058 --> 45:26.059
You tend to be.

45:28.478 --> 45:29.646
I'm not going anywhere.

45:29.730 --> 45:31.064
This isn't your fight.

45:31.148 --> 45:33.483
Oh, yeah? Whose fight is it then?

45:39.323 --> 45:40.324
Seldon's?

45:42.367 --> 45:43.952
Then it's not your fight either.

45:46.747 --> 45:47.748
Come away with me.

45:49.166 --> 45:50.167
I can't.

45:50.250 --> 45:51.251
Why not?

45:54.213 --> 45:55.672
Because I have to protect them.

45:58.550 --> 46:00.761
To be alive is to know ghosts.

46:01.845 --> 46:05.349
The Empire feared Hari
because he could forecast the future.

46:06.767 --> 46:10.604
But, in reality, all he was doing
was reexamining the past.

46:14.483 --> 46:15.901
What do you want?

46:17.653 --> 46:21.865
Pay attention to the patterns
and we can presage what comes next.

46:26.328 --> 46:28.789
To be alive is to know ghosts.

46:29.498 --> 46:32.000
We hear their whispers if we listen.

46:52.771 --> 46:53.897
You again.

47:26.805 --> 47:27.848
Hey there.

47:32.019 --> 47:33.270
What got you, Maybel?

47:41.403 --> 47:42.446
This is gonna hurt.

47:56.210 --> 47:57.211
Easy.

47:59.004 --> 48:00.214
Drop your weapon.

48:06.887 --> 48:07.930
Who are you?

48:08.013 --> 48:11.725
Salvor Hardin, warden of Terminus.

48:16.772 --> 48:19.274
Anacreons aren't allowed on imperial soil.

48:23.195 --> 48:24.321
What are you doing here?

48:25.239 --> 48:29.868
The ghosts of the dead haunt
the skeletons that were once our homes.

48:30.702 --> 48:32.287
They surround us.

48:32.371 --> 48:35.040
And they're hungry for what's ours.
