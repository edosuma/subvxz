00:08.048 --> 00:12.884
Remember, cosmetic surgery
is only a superficial solution.'

00:13.263 --> 00:18.132
It can lift eyelids, but not the little cloud
of pessimism hovering over you.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.677
Thank you for your call.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.088
OK, Roz, so who's our next caller?

00:25.066 --> 00:26.818
Roz?

00:27.068 --> 00:30.140
This'd be a good time
to go to commercial break.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.563
We'll be right back
after these messages.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:47.380 --> 00:50.019
- Frasier?
- Hello.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.435
Disturbing seeing no one there?

00:53.720 --> 00:58.191
I was finding out if they've announced
the nominations for the SeaBs.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.435
I forgot, are those out today?

01:00.685 --> 01:03.597
You forgot?
The biggest award in Seattle radio!

01:03.897 --> 01:06.491
I suppose it's the difference in our ages.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.970
I don't get excited about...

01:09.235 --> 01:11.430
well, much anymore.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.493
Congratulations.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.618
- Yes! Yes! We got the nomination!
- Who'd you hear it from?

01:16.910 --> 01:21.347
I haven't. I was congratulating
you on a great show.

01:21.706 --> 01:25.585
If anyone deserves a nomination,
you guys do.

01:28.296 --> 01:32.084
- Get out, Noel.
- OK, catch you later.

01:34.469 --> 01:38.428
Well, I guess I'm a little more
excited than I let on!

01:39.974 --> 01:45.048
- It'd be a feather in my cap to win.
- Are you kidding?! In ten years,

01:45.438 --> 01:47.315
I've never produced
a show that got nominated.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.520
(Phone rings)

01:49.651 --> 01:52.006
Hello... hi, Millie... you're kidding!

01:53.697 --> 01:57.053
- That's great! Thanks, bye.
- We got the nomination?

01:57.367 --> 02:01.155
- No, Millie's getting married.
- Damn it, Roz!

02:03.873 --> 02:08.947
She said she'd been seeing someone
else - couldn't keep living a lie.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.089
I was dumbfounded.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.172
What about everything
we'd gone through?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.423
Didn't that mean anything?

02:17.554 --> 02:21.103
Niles, a patient has a right
to change therapists.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.555
- Frasier, thank God!
- What're you doing here?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.811
What kind of agent would I be

02:29.065 --> 02:31.260
if I didn't tell you
you've been nominated?!

02:31.526 --> 02:34.245
(Shouts) I was nominated!

02:34.529 --> 02:36.645
Ha-ha!

02:38.116 --> 02:40.550
Well... I was!

02:41.119 --> 02:45.271
Yes, you... Frasier Crane,
MD, PhD, STUD,

02:45.623 --> 02:47.659
are the man of the hour!

02:49.210 --> 02:51.166
Bebe Glazer, Frasier's agent.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.889
Dr Niles Crane, Frasier's brother.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.972
- You're not a psychiatrist, too?
- Yes.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.890
Oh, please, if I'm ever to have
a breakdown, let me have it now.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.011
Double double decaf to go.

03:08.480 --> 03:14.191
So, this is quite a surprise.
I forgot the nominations were out today.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.524
Oh, isn't he precious?
You must be very proud of Frasier.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.174
Actually...no.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.938
It's one more signpost on the road
of celebrity my brother's chosen.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.965
Hope that's not sibling rivalry
rearing its green snout?!

03:32.087 --> 03:35.875
Absolutely not. I believe
psychiatry's a noble profession,

03:36.216 --> 03:41.370
...tarnished by popularity contests
and a bouncy radio programme!

03:42.514 --> 03:46.951
I bet you two had wicked little
hair-pulling fights when you were tots!

03:50.063 --> 03:52.736
It's been delightful, I must run.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.983
My sexual addiction group -
I don't like to leave them alone too long.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.835
- Frasier!
- Roz!

04:01.950 --> 04:03.906
We did it!

04:04.160 --> 04:07.516
I know! Come sit down.
I've never won before.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.584
Although back in prep school the
existentialist club

04:10.875 --> 04:13.628
once named me most likely "to be"!

04:15.588 --> 04:19.103
You wanna hear the great part?
I've a date for the ceremony -

04:19.426 --> 04:21.178
Brad Macnamara!

04:21.428 --> 04:24.340
The Channel Eight reporter?
Television's most handsome man.

04:24.639 --> 04:30.635
He wouldn't give me time of day but
one nomination - he knew who I was!

04:31.479 --> 04:33.515
Who are you?

04:33.773 --> 04:36.048
Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.751
Oh, right.
I've seen you bring him coffee.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.463
Would you mind getting mine?

04:43.074 --> 04:46.783
Better get on the ball.
I've a lot to do!

04:47.162 --> 04:52.873
Not really, I got your tux, rented a limo,
your tickets will be at the door.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.683
The only thing you haven't taken
care of is finding me a date?!

04:57.005 --> 05:00.441
Your subtlety floors me!
I'd love to!

05:00.759 --> 05:04.547
I'm thrilled, for you both -
but I've got to run.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.356
Two clients weren't nominated.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.552
I have to tell them
what a worthless award this is!

05:14.981 --> 05:17.734
Daphne, you may not be aware of this,

05:18.026 --> 05:20.745
but there's a secret
to opening champagne.

05:21.029 --> 05:25.307
Especially a fine French champagne
as unprepossessing as this one -

05:25.658 --> 05:27.376
$200 a bottle.

05:28.995 --> 05:33.989
In order to prevent spillage
one does not simply twist out the cork.

05:34.376 --> 05:40.531
Instead, hold the cork stationary.
Give the bottle three easy turns.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.434
One...
(Cork pops)

05:43.677 --> 05:46.635
Get some glasses!
Quick! Oh... oh, my god.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.329
Eddie, get out of there,
you mangy little cur!

05:54.646 --> 05:57.035
Here... Oh, Lord.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.910
That wasn't too bad.
I believe we've salvaged most of it.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.625
A toast.
To my number-one son,

06:03.905 --> 06:06.783
congratulations
on your first nomination for...

06:08.284 --> 06:10.798
..well, anything!

06:11.079 --> 06:14.276
- Frasier, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, means a lot to me.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.250
Mm... this champagne is delicious.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.332
Exquisite. Dad, what do you think?

06:21.589 --> 06:24.342
I was in the mood
for something domestic!

06:26.594 --> 06:30.792
I must say, it's nice that
although I'm an employee,

06:31.141 --> 06:34.258
you include me in family celebrations.

06:34.561 --> 06:38.236
Never doubt that I think of you
as my equal in every way.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.377
(Doorbell)

06:46.322 --> 06:48.472
(Doorbell rings again)

06:49.576 --> 06:51.771
Oh, I'll get it.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.426
- Would you?
- Like me to announce your visitor?

06:54.706 --> 06:57.140
(Shouts) Just open the door!

06:57.417 --> 07:01.205
Oh, hello, Roz!
Congratulations

07:01.546 --> 07:06.142
Thanks. I couldn't believe it myself.
Brad Macnamara!

07:07.719 --> 07:10.631
Roz, she was referring
to your SeaB nomination.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.842
No, I meant Brad Macnamara.

07:14.851 --> 07:19.003
- Think he wears pants under the desk?
- Not on my TV!

07:22.233 --> 07:25.225
Girls, can we cut out
the pyjama party, please?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.600
- Hello, Mr C.
- Hey, Roz, how's my girlfriend?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.137
Well, she's nominated.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.764
A glass of champagne?

07:34.037 --> 07:36.073
It's French and unprepossessing.

07:36.331 --> 07:40.290
Save your breath. It could come out
of a box - Roz would have a glass of it!

07:42.087 --> 07:44.726
I'm so proud of you, Roz,

07:45.006 --> 07:47.804
being recognised
in a male-dominated industry.

07:48.093 --> 07:53.167
- One more step for working women.
- You're a credit to our gender.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.433
Thank you.

07:55.684 --> 07:59.518
That reminds me, do you have
a push-up bra I could borrow?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.970
- I'll look.
- Thanks.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.850
I'm sorry to barge in
but I had to show you this, Frasier.

08:10.198 --> 08:15.318
A friend at "Broadcast" magazine
sent me a copy. It's a full-page ad.

08:16.621 --> 08:21.411
'Wendy Yashiro thanks the voting
committee for her nomination

08:21.793 --> 08:24.910
'and hopes they consider her
for the award.'

08:26.381 --> 08:29.578
This is shameless self-promotion,
very bad taste!

08:29.884 --> 08:32.477
I know! What'll we put in our ad?

08:32.761 --> 08:37.756
Wendy Yashiro's up against you?
I like her - she's a cutie!

08:38.143 --> 08:40.703
You're suggesting we put an ad in?

08:40.979 --> 08:44.415
We're falling behind, Mike Sanchez
has sent out tapes of his show.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.566
Mike Sanchez? Oh, I like him!

08:48.987 --> 08:50.943
Who knows
what Fletcher Grey's doing?

08:51.197 --> 08:55.076
- Fletcher Grey...!!
- (Shouts) Thank you, Dad! Geez!

08:56.494 --> 09:01.090
Well, all right. As long as
it's tasteful and understated.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.167
Great. My friend'll
work something up for us.

09:05.503 --> 09:09.940
Wait. If we want to stand out,
why run another boring ad?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.256
We should do something different.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.627
Last year's winner threw a party.

09:15.930 --> 09:20.446
OK, but we should do something else
to keep our names in their minds.

09:23.146 --> 09:27.503
I know, personalized gifts from...
the new Tiffany's catalogue!

09:27.859 --> 09:30.817
- Ooh, that's good!
- I saw incredible cigarette cases.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.741
No - sends out a bad message.
A silver flask?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.669
We've already got your vote, Roz.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.119
I mightn't know about show business,

09:41.414 --> 09:45.930
but gifts for people who could do
something for you, that's bribery!

09:46.294 --> 09:48.125
It's a thank you for a nomination!

09:48.380 --> 09:53.500
If I had to give a gift to get
an award it's not worth having.

09:53.885 --> 09:59.164
You might as well just go down
to the trophy store and buy one.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.751
- I really want that award.
- Me, too.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.703
Get that catalogue!

10:29.421 --> 10:31.377
Well, are you coming in or not?

10:32.674 --> 10:35.347
This is a big moment.
I want to drink it in.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.024
Me, too. Where's the bar?

10:39.264 --> 10:42.222
Not so fast.
Me shoes are killing me!

10:42.517 --> 10:46.749
I should never have let
that salesgirl talk me into them.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.573
- They look good on you.
- You think so?

10:50.775 --> 10:53.414
Dr Crane. Bob Peterson,
voting committee.

10:53.695 --> 10:57.005
- I wanted to wish you luck.
- Thank you.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.520
- Oh, and thanks for the bathrobe.
- Oh... nothing!

11:00.827 --> 11:03.341
People get out of the shower,
they're cold!

11:04.456 --> 11:07.095
Hey, Dr Crane, love the watch!

11:07.375 --> 11:11.653
Thanks, it was nothing.
Pretty good likeness of me, isn't it?!

11:12.505 --> 11:17.295
Can we please sit down?
I have got to sit down.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.635
Daphne, we're table eight.
This isn't our table!

11:20.930 --> 11:22.761
It is now!

11:23.016 --> 11:25.769
- Isn't that Fletcher Grey?
- I believe it is.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.734
You got your work cut out for you.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.810
A class act!
I've listened to him for 20 years.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.700
I don't usually do this,
but I'm going to shake his hand.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.100
Hey, guys.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.402
Oh, Roz. My fellow nominee.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.968
Everybody's talking about those gifts.

11:44.245 --> 11:48.079
Did you see valet parking?
Half the key chains are ours!

11:49.501 --> 11:51.571
This is a big night for me.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.908
Please don't spoil it
by making fun of who I brought.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.571
I thought you were bringing
Brad Macnamara.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.639
He got called out on a story.
Some hospital went up in flames.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.681
Do you know anyone
who has worse luck than I do?

12:08.770 --> 12:10.965
Hi, Dr Crane.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.819
- Oh, hi, Noel
- Noel Shempsky's your date?

12:16.152 --> 12:19.269
Uh, tip, Dr Crane?
If you're nominated again,

12:19.572 --> 12:23.850
there's parking three blocks
away - they don't check after 6.00!

12:25.954 --> 12:29.151
Oh, um... here are the car keys
so you can drive us home.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.413
I have night blindness.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.714
I wish I did.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.999
- Hi. I'm Noel.
- Nice to meet you.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.738
Can you rub me feet?
- Oh, Daphne!

12:45.932 --> 12:49.527
- Good evening, everybody.
- Niles! Thanks for coming!

12:49.853 --> 12:53.050
I know how you feel about this award
and coming downtown after dark.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.790
Don't be silly, you're my brother.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.103
- Hello, Daphne.
- Can you rub me feet?

12:58.361 --> 13:00.317
- Yes.
- Niles!

13:04.409 --> 13:07.799
- Where's Maris?
- We were leaving

13:08.121 --> 13:11.079
when Maris
glimpsed herself in the mirror...

13:11.374 --> 13:13.683
At the end of this, will I roll my eyes?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.554
- I did.
- Well, then, skip it!

13:18.089 --> 13:20.398
Listen, get me a Scotch, would you?

13:20.675 --> 13:25.669
That Fletcher Grey, he's aces!
He remembered me from 1968!

13:26.056 --> 13:29.173
I worked on a murder case
he covered.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.832
He looked at me and said, "Hey,
you're the guy who found the head!"

13:36.066 --> 13:39.741
He's been nominated 11 times
and never won.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.789
Really? Geez, I didn't know that.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.541
I'm afraid he'll have to lose again.

13:45.825 --> 13:50.945
If he does, you can cheer him up -
send something from your gift shop!

13:52.415 --> 13:55.293
- Dr Crane?
- Fletcher Grey!

13:55.585 --> 13:59.055
Been meaning to wish you luck
even though you don't need it.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.691
That's kind, but I hardly think
I have a chance against you!

14:03.009 --> 14:06.160
I hope you're right. I'd love to win.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.978
11 losses - it's a little embarrassing!

14:10.266 --> 14:14.544
Oh, you'd have to lose 15, 16 times
before you could feel ashamed.

14:15.855 --> 14:19.370
Would you believe,
I considered campaigning this year?

14:20.402 --> 14:23.075
Sending out gifts, throwing a party.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.515
I bet you'd have something to say
about someone that self-absorbed!

14:27.867 --> 14:31.143
He could do a whole hour on it!

14:31.454 --> 14:34.571
Dear, they're starting
to serve the salads.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.550
Oh, Mom! I'm 60 years old
and I'm still her little boy.

14:39.921 --> 14:43.800
- Dr Crane. My mother, Hannah.
- Nice to meet you.

14:44.968 --> 14:50.088
Mom just flew in from Scottsdale.
This is her 11th year.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.533
I hope he wins it this time.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.805
It's getting harder and harder
to get on that plane.

15:02.027 --> 15:06.976
Why don't you go back to the table
before your legs swell up?

15:07.365 --> 15:12.120
I'll get you another Pink Lady.
No, no, no, Mom, over there.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.425
Sorry - been detained!

15:17.709 --> 15:19.665
Civilization won't advance one iota

15:19.919 --> 15:23.070
till they put more toilets
in the ladies' room!

15:24.716 --> 15:28.914
- Thank you, Niles.
- Oh, champagne!

15:30.889 --> 15:33.483
Uh, a diet root beer?

15:36.478 --> 15:39.595
I have to tell you the buzz in line

15:39.898 --> 15:43.254
was that those gifts
you've been sending paid off.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.560
It looks like you're in a neck-and-neck
race with Fletcher Grey,

15:46.863 --> 15:49.696
that wrinkled warhorse...

15:52.494 --> 15:54.883
Hello, Mr Crane.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.916
You're more handsome than before!

15:58.208 --> 16:01.837
If I were 20 years older,
they couldn't keep me away!

16:02.170 --> 16:04.126
That's why I keep this cane!

16:07.967 --> 16:11.164
Good evening,
would everybody take their seats?

16:11.471 --> 16:16.261
I'm Keith Bishop, welcome
to the 15th annual SeaB awards.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.761
Assisting me tonight in handing out
the awards is Miss SeaB 1994,

16:21.106 --> 16:23.256
Tawny Van Deusen.

16:30.907 --> 16:34.661
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable
about the campaigning.

16:34.995 --> 16:40.115
Fletcher's been nominated 11 times!
He didn't lift a finger to win this.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.651
Don't worry about him,
he can win it next year.

16:44.838 --> 16:50.037
Before we start this evening,
I'd like to make a sad announcement.

16:50.427 --> 16:54.181
I just found out
that the Dean of Seattle radio,

16:54.514 --> 16:58.348
my mentor, Fletcher Grey,
will be retiring this year.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.676
(Audience) Ahhhh!

17:02.022 --> 17:04.172
Take a bow, Fletcher.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.647
We're gonna start with a bang!

17:11.906 --> 17:15.740
The award for achievement
in informational programming.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.193
That's us!

17:18.454 --> 17:22.050
Can't see a thing without my glasses!
(Audience laugh)

17:23.501 --> 17:29.098
Fletcher deserves this award.
If we win - can't we just not accept it?

17:29.507 --> 17:32.305
I've waited ten years to get this.

17:32.594 --> 17:37.270
If I have to crawl over Fletcher's
mother to get it, I'll do it!

17:40.226 --> 17:42.262
Roz, I've never seen you like this!

17:42.520 --> 17:44.875
- It isn't pretty
-The nominations...

18:20.141 --> 18:22.416
(Audience) Bravo! Bravo!

18:24.104 --> 18:27.141
If we win this thing,
they're gonna lynch us!

18:27.440 --> 18:30.477
At least everyone will see my dress!

18:32.487 --> 18:36.036
Well, this is a first.
It seems we have a tie.

18:36.366 --> 18:40.598
- Good, we can share it with Fletcher!
- I'm already sharing it with you!

18:42.205 --> 18:45.914
And the winners are
Wendy Yashiro and Mike Sanchez!

18:46.251 --> 18:49.846
- What?
- What?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.287
(Applause)

19:01.349 --> 19:04.068
The party's over.
Are you coming home?

19:04.352 --> 19:07.150
- No, Dad.
- We'll just go without you.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.077
Fine.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.995
I don't agree with the way you went
about it but I'm sorry you lost.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.834
It's never easy to lose.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.549
Thanks, Dad.

19:19.826 --> 19:24.024
Of course, if you'd joined sport
at an early age...

19:24.372 --> 19:27.648
- Dad
- All right, sorry, wrong time!

19:27.959 --> 19:31.429
We'll talk about it over breakfast.

19:31.755 --> 19:36.112
OK, Daphne, let's get you home
and soak your feet in Epsom salts.

19:36.468 --> 19:39.380
Oh, I have the life of a princess!

19:40.764 --> 19:44.040
Don't feel bad, Roz.
It's an honour just to get a nomination.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.546
Will you stop saying that?

19:46.811 --> 19:49.200
OK, I'm leaving.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.837
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry,
I'm just despondent.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.810
No, no, go ahead.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.267
Roz!

19:59.532 --> 20:04.481
Noel, Noel, I'm sorry. Thank you.
I'll see you at work on Monday?

20:09.376 --> 20:12.209
- How are you?
- Oh, I've been better.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.586
Thank you.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.694
When you feel the sting of losing

20:24.974 --> 20:29.206
you have to realise the fact
that it's not about awards,

20:29.562 --> 20:33.999
it's not about accolades,
it's about a body of work.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.908
If you can look in the mirror
and say you've done a good job,

20:38.238 --> 20:40.706
that's what matters.

20:40.990 --> 20:45.381
If you can do that,
let the awards fall where they may.

20:48.289 --> 20:51.725
Wow! All those nominations,
nothing to show for it.

20:53.253 --> 20:56.962
He still walks out, head high,
and a smile on his face.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.919
I'm never gonna get nominated again.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.656
- Oh, come on, Roz.
- I'm not.

21:07.851 --> 21:11.890
The world's full of winners
and losers - I'm a loser.

21:12.230 --> 21:17.350
- I wouldn't be with you if you were.
- Come on, we're a team.

21:18.153 --> 21:22.624
Before we're done we're going
to win lots of these things.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.710
You and I are <i>amigos, compadres.</i>

21:25.994 --> 21:28.030
OK? Now,
I'm not going to leave your side

21:28.288 --> 21:30.199
till I see a little smile on that face.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.594
Dr Crane?

21:34.878 --> 21:38.553
I love your show and I was wondering -
would you like to have a drink?

21:38.882 --> 21:41.032
(Sobbing)

21:50.352 --> 21:54.140
Do I see the beginning
of a little smile?

21:56.608 --> 21:59.042
- Oh, go ahead.
- Thanks, Roz.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.153
So, that's a very interesting
name you have.

22:03.448 --> 22:08.442
- You mean "Miss SeaB"?
- Well, actually, l, uh... yeah.

22:13.166 --> 22:18.559
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:18.963 --> 22:20.282
# Quite stylish

22:20.507 --> 22:27.140
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged

22:27.597 --> 22:33.069
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.478 --> 22:35.992
# They're calling again #

22:36.272 --> 22:38.467
Goodnight, Seattle, we love you!
