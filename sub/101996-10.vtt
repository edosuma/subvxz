WEBVTT

00:08.399 --> 00:10.706
THIS IS DANA DEWITT REPORTING
LIVE ON THE SCENE

00:10.749 --> 00:11.881
WITH BREAKING NEWS!

00:11.924 --> 00:13.535
AAH! UNH!

00:15.406 --> 00:17.974
AND BREAKING BONES AS BATWOMAN
HAS TAKEN THE FIGHT

00:18.018 --> 00:20.846
TO THE FALSE FACE SOCIETY,
DISRUPTING THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN

00:20.890 --> 00:24.024
OF THE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE
STREET DRUG SNAKEBITE.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.100
THIS IS THE THIRD
DISTRIBUTION CENTER THIS WEEK

00:57.144 --> 00:59.015
THAT BATWOMAN HAS TARGETED
IN HER MISSION

00:59.059 --> 01:02.192
TO RID GOTHAM'S STREETS
OF THIS SCOURGE.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.586
WHO IS BLACK MASK?

01:04.629 --> 01:05.891
I WANT THE NAME!

01:05.935 --> 01:07.371
I DON'T KNOW!

01:07.415 --> 01:09.112
LOOK. THAT'S WHY WE
ALL WEAR MASKS.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.418
UNH!

01:15.901 --> 01:17.729
YOU HEAR ME, BLACK MASK?

01:17.773 --> 01:20.993
YOU CAN HIDE YOUR FACE,
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.865
I AM COMING FOR YOU!

01:22.908 --> 01:24.867
IN A CHANNEL 8 EXCLUSIVE,

01:24.910 --> 01:28.914
BATWOMAN LAID DOWN THE LAW
AND DECLARED WAR ON BLACK MASK,

01:28.958 --> 01:30.916
AND CITIZENS OF GOTHAM HAVE
HIGH HOPES

01:30.960 --> 01:33.484
THAT SHE CAN SUCCEED
WHERE THE GCPD

01:33.528 --> 01:35.791
AND THE CROWS HAVE FAILED.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.883
UNH!

01:53.287 --> 01:54.766
YOU STAY HERE.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.123
-WHERE IS SHE?
-MR. KANE, THERE'S BEEN

02:03.166 --> 02:04.385
A TERRIBLE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

02:04.428 --> 02:05.864
WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?

02:05.908 --> 02:07.736
SIR, PLEASE ALLOW
ME TO EXPLAIN.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.259
MY DAUGHTER BETH CALLED ME
NOT ONE HOUR AGO
FROM THIS HOUSE.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.695
SHE SAID, "HELP,"
CLEAR AS CAN BE.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.349
IT WAS ALL
AN INSENSITIVE PRANK.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.960
I'M--I'M--I'M--I'M
SO EMBARRASSED. I--

02:15.004 --> 02:16.875
MR. KANE, YOUR DAUGHTER
IS NOT IN THERE.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.574
BETH! BETH!

02:19.617 --> 02:22.272
BETH, ARE YOU
IN HERE?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.942
BETH? BETH?

02:39.985 --> 02:41.335
DADDY?

02:47.515 --> 02:49.169
YOU CAME FOR ME.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.651
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

02:53.695 --> 02:57.220
I'D NEVER STOP
LOOKING FOR YOU.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.961
NEVER.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.951
YOU PRETTY MUCH BROKE
THE INTERNET

03:32.995 --> 03:34.692
WITH THIS LATEST
FALSE FACE TAKEDOWN.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.172
ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN YOU MORE LIKES

03:36.216 --> 03:38.000
IS IF YOU'D DONE IT
HOLDING A KITTEN,

03:38.043 --> 03:39.871
BUT I DO HAVE TO POINT OUT
THAT YOU WERE LITERALLY

03:39.915 --> 03:42.004
HOLDING A MICROPHONE
AND DIDN'T GO FOR THE MIC DROP.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.354
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
WANTED TO STAY ON MESSAGE.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.487
WELL, I THINK BLACK MASK
HEARD IT LOUD AND CLEAR.

03:46.530 --> 03:47.923
IF YOU'RE STILL CALLING
HIM THAT, I'M ASSUMING

03:47.966 --> 03:50.142
YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT
HIS REAL NAME.

03:50.186 --> 03:53.537
HE TOLD ME BATWOMAN
KILLED HIS DAUGHTER.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.366
SERIOUSLY, THAT DOESN'T
SHORTEN THE LIST?

03:56.410 --> 03:59.978
THERE IS NO LIST.
KATE NEVER KILLED
ANYBODY'S DAUGHTER.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.633
DON'T FORGET HE ALSO
BLAMES THE CROWS.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.200
I ASSUME NEXT WEEK
IT'LL BE AQUAMAN.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.333
DAMN.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.117
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
IS YOUR WATCH FAST?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.597
HAVE YOU MET ME?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.902
-THEN I'M ALREADY LATE.
-FOR WHAT?

04:10.946 --> 04:12.513
VISITING HOURS.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.482
THANKS FOR COMING.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.832
HADN'T HEARD
FROM YOU IN A BIT.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.921
COMMISSARY ACCOUNT'S
DOWN TO NADA.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.750
10-MINUTE PHONE CALL
COSTS 22 BONES AND CHANGE.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.579
DAMN. IT WAS 11.50
WHEN I WAS INSIDE.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.625
WELCOME TO THE EDGEWATER
PRIVATE PRISON SYSTEM,

04:37.668 --> 04:40.410
AND 7 CENTS AN HOUR
PRESSING BLUE JEANS

04:40.454 --> 04:42.978
DOESN'T GO AS FAR
AS IT USED TO,

04:43.021 --> 04:44.893
BUT I, UH, KNOW YOU
DIDN'T COME HERE

04:44.936 --> 04:47.374
BECAUSE YOU MISS BEING
ON THE INSIDE.

04:47.417 --> 04:52.074
TELL ME WHAT AM I
MISSING ON THE OUTSIDE.

04:52.117 --> 04:56.296
I'M HELPING TO GET
A COMMUNITY CENTER
OFF THE GROUND,

04:56.339 --> 04:58.602
KIND OF PLACE YOU
AND I WOULD HAVE LOVED,

04:58.646 --> 05:00.648
YOU KNOW, GIVES KIDS
A SAFE SPACE TO GO TO

05:00.691 --> 05:04.042
INSTEAD OF GOING
INTO THE SYSTEM.

05:04.086 --> 05:06.131
OPEN HOUSE IS TONIGHT.

05:06.175 --> 05:10.527
SOUNDS NICE. HEH.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.442
I WISH I COULD GET
TO SEE IT.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.792
YOU COULD.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.838
YOU COULD WALK
RIGHT OUT OF HERE

05:16.881 --> 05:18.666
IF YOU JUST GIVE UP
THE ONES

05:18.709 --> 05:19.884
WHO ACTUALLY PULLED
THE TRIGGER

05:19.928 --> 05:21.712
ON COMMISSIONER FORBES.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.280
LOOK. I KNOW YOU
TOOK THE FALL

05:24.324 --> 05:26.630
TO KEEP ME SAFE
FROM FALSE FACE,

05:26.674 --> 05:28.893
BUT I CAN PROTECT
MYSELF.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.809
SURE IT'S NOT BATWOMAN
PROTECTING YOU?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.376
IS SHE YOUR
GIRLFRIEND NOW?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.465
ARE GUYS LIKE SUPER FRIENDS
WITH BENEFITS?

05:35.509 --> 05:37.815
TRUST ME IT IS
NOT LIKE THAT.

05:39.251 --> 05:42.603
IT NEVER IS
TILL IT IS.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.561
I'M LATE FOR
MY 7 CENTS AN HOUR.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.143
HEH HEH HEH.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.450
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

06:03.493 --> 06:07.323
AS YOU LOOK AROUND AND SEE
ALL WE HAVE TO OFFER,

06:07.367 --> 06:09.151
KNOW THAT NONE OF IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE

06:09.194 --> 06:12.067
WITHOUT THE RELENTLESS
DEDICATION OF OUR VOLUNTEERS.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.895
WHOO!

06:13.938 --> 06:17.638
AND I KNOW THEY WANTED
TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS,

06:17.681 --> 06:20.031
SO I'LL JUST SAY

06:20.075 --> 06:22.077
TO MARY HAMILTON
AND RYAN WILDER,

06:22.120 --> 06:23.600
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.518
YOU WOMEN ARE SUPERHEROES.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.998
KEEP SMILING.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.521
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.088
PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE

06:33.131 --> 06:35.090
ALL THE ACTIVITIES
WE HAVE TO OFFER.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.787
YOU'LL FIND WE'VE GOT
EVERYTHING HERE

06:36.831 --> 06:38.310
FROM INTRAMURAL SPORTS
TO AFTER-SCHOOL TUTORING,

06:38.354 --> 06:40.922
-AND WE ALS--
-WHAT ABOUT SECURITY?

06:40.965 --> 06:43.533
HORTEN SPENCE,
"GOTHAM GAZETTE."

06:43.577 --> 06:45.405
WELL, MR. SPENCE,
DON'T YOU THINK

06:45.448 --> 06:47.885
THE KIDS AROUND HERE ALREADY
HAVE ENOUGH ARMED MEN

06:47.929 --> 06:49.844
WATCHING THEIR EVERY MOVE?

06:52.673 --> 06:55.066
LOOK. DON'T GET
ME WRONG.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.546
I LIKE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING,

06:56.590 --> 06:58.026
BUT THIS IS
A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.549
THE STATS DON'T LIE.

06:59.593 --> 07:00.855
IF YOU WANT
NUMBERS, MR. SPENCE,

07:00.898 --> 07:02.857
HOW ABOUT A 10% DROP
IN CRIME

07:02.900 --> 07:05.686
OR A 15% INCREASE
IN GRADUATION RATES?

07:05.729 --> 07:07.470
THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS
THAT NEIGHBORHOODS SEE

07:07.514 --> 07:11.213
WHEN COMMUNITY CENTERS
LIKE THIS OPEN THEIR DOORS.

07:11.256 --> 07:14.259
YOU AREN'T WORRIED
ABOUT THIS PLACE
BEING A TARGET?

07:14.303 --> 07:15.783
FOR BUDGET CUTS MAYBE.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.698
YOU KNOW, DESPITE DOING
SO MUCH,

07:17.741 --> 07:19.830
PLACES LIKE THIS ARE ALWAYS
FIRST ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.833
MAYBE THE "GAZETTE" COULD
DO A STORY ABOUT THAT.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.275
GOOD TURNOUT.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.408
OH, MY GOD.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.629
I ALREADY
HAVE TO REFRESH
THE REFRESHMENTS.

07:37.761 --> 07:40.808
WILDER,
I WANT YOU TO MEET IMANI,

07:40.851 --> 07:42.853
DIRECTOR OF OUR
TUTORING PROGRAM.

07:42.897 --> 07:46.204
OH. WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
SCHOOLED THAT REPORTER
BACK THERE.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.250
-I'M RYAN.
-I KNOW.

07:48.293 --> 07:51.079
I HEAR YOU'RE
GONNA BE TEACHING
A MARTIAL ARTS CLASS.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.776
UH, I ACTUALLY HADN'T
GOTTEN AROUND

07:52.820 --> 07:55.518
TO ROPING HER
INTO THAT YET....

07:55.562 --> 07:57.259
UNTIL NOW.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.652
UH, SATURDAY MORNING.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.958
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.831
LOOK WHO NEEDS A REFILL.
TCH, TCH. ME!

08:03.874 --> 08:06.442
HA! HEH HEH.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.879
UM, I'M HOPING
YOU'RE GONNA SAY
YES TO THAT

08:08.923 --> 08:11.534
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
TEACH MARTIAL ARTS,
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO,

08:11.578 --> 08:13.841
AND MY ROUNDHOUSE KICK
IS A DISASTER.

08:13.884 --> 08:16.539
WELL, I FIGURE IT'S
THE LEAST I CAN DO.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.933
HEH. CRAZY.
I--I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK

08:18.976 --> 08:21.892
HOW MUCH A PLACE
LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE
REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE

08:21.936 --> 08:23.764
FOR MY FRIENDS AND I
GROWING UP.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.940
YEAH. THESE PLACES
ARE SO IMPORTANT,

08:25.983 --> 08:28.508
ESPECIALLY FOR AT-RISK KIDS.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.206
IT'S SO EASY FOR THEM TO
FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.556
YEAH, I KNOW.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.385
I HAVE A FRIEND
WHO'S STILL FALLING.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.565
EVERYBODY, DOWN!

09:09.636 --> 09:12.029
FOR THOSE OF YOU

09:12.073 --> 09:13.596
NOT KEEPING UP
ON CURRENT EVENTS,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.032
HOW'S THIS
FOR A SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT?

09:15.076 --> 09:16.468
A COMMUNITY CENTER
IN SHELDON PARK

09:16.512 --> 09:18.166
JUST GOT BARBEQUED
BY A MAN WIELDING

09:18.209 --> 09:20.864
WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED
AS A LIGHTNING GUN.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.040
THE MEDIA HAS DUBBED HIM
KILOVOLT.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.651
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, GOTHAM,

09:24.694 --> 09:26.870
BUT I'M HOPING LIGHTNING
DOESN'T STRIKE TWICE.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.874
KILOVOLT?
BASED ON THE ENERGY NEEDED

09:30.918 --> 09:32.484
TO DO THAT KIND OF DAMAGE,
THEY'RE ONLY OFF

09:32.528 --> 09:34.617
BY ABOUT A BILLION VOLTS.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.098
THAT'S YOUR TAKEAWAY?
THE NICKNAME DROPPED
A FEW ZEROES?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.579
MY POINT BEING A WEAPON
WITH THAT KIND OF FIREPOWER

09:39.622 --> 09:41.015
COSTS A HELL
OF A LOT MORE

09:41.058 --> 09:42.930
THAN THE BUILDING IT WAS
USED TO DESTROY.

09:42.973 --> 09:46.020
IT WAS MORE THAN
A BUILDING.

09:46.063 --> 09:48.457
THAT PLACE WAS GONNA
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.980
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY TAKE IT OUT?

09:50.024 --> 09:51.895
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE
WAS ANY MONEY IN IT.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.462
IT'S ABOUT TO HAVE
EVEN LESS MONEY NOW.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.290
DONORS RUNNING
FOR THEIR LIVES

09:55.333 --> 09:56.944
ISN'T EXACTLY THE PRESS
WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.337
BUT IT WAS THE STORY
THE PRESS WAS
LOOKING FOR.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.035
DON'T YOU THINK IT
WAS A LITTLE WEIRD

10:01.078 --> 10:03.080
THAT REPORTER ASKING
ABOUT THE PLACE
BEING A TARGET

10:03.124 --> 10:05.256
RIGHT BEFORE IT
BECAME A TARGET?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.389
-WHAT WAS THE GUY'S NAME?
-HORTEN SPENCE.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.825
HE WRITES
FOR THE "GAZETTE."

10:13.874 --> 10:16.093
NOT ANYMORE HE DOESN'T.

10:16.137 --> 10:19.096
HE WAS FIRED 6 MONTHS AGO
FOR UNDISCLOSED REASONS.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.316
OK. THEN I GET
WHY HE'D HAVE A GRUDGE

10:21.359 --> 10:22.970
AGAINST THE "GAZETTE,"
BUT WHAT DOES THAT

10:23.013 --> 10:24.580
HAVE TO DO
WITH THE COMMUNITY CENTER?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.408
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.282
I DON'T GET IT.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.415
YEAH. WELL, THAT
MAKES TWO OF US.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.547
THESE ARE
EXPENSE REPORT RECORDS

10:35.591 --> 10:37.680
FROM WHEN I WAS
CHASING DOWN LEADS
ON KATE'S WHEREABOUTS.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.944
TWO NIGHTS IN MONACO,
A LAYOVER IN VALENCIA,

10:40.988 --> 10:42.816
A CAR RENTAL
IN MADRID.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.513
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

10:44.556 --> 10:47.168
I HAVE NO MEMORY
OF BEING IN ANY
OF THOSE PLACES.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.866
NO JUDGMENT HERE,
BUT...

10:49.910 --> 10:51.738
WERE YOU DRINKING?

10:51.781 --> 10:53.565
WELL, I WAS
SEARCHING FOR ONE EX,

10:53.609 --> 10:56.438
HAVING JUST BEEN
DUMPED BY ANOTHER,
SO YEAH,

10:56.481 --> 10:58.048
ALCOHOL WAS CONSUMED

10:58.092 --> 11:00.224
BUT NOT THAT MUCH.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.357
BUT IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER,
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER

11:02.400 --> 11:04.315
IT WASN'T THAT MUCH.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.671
SO IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT THE OBVIOUS
EXPLANATION

11:11.714 --> 11:13.673
IS THE CORRECT ONE.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.152
HEY. DON'T BEAT
YOURSELF UP.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.418
AGENT PENNYWORTH.

11:20.462 --> 11:23.030
JUST GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP
ABOUT A BREAK-IN AT A FARM.

11:23.073 --> 11:27.687
THE ADDRESS MATCHES
A PROPERTY THAT ONCE BELONGED
TO AN AUGUST CARTWRIGHT.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.645
WHAT ELSE DID
THIS TIPSTER SAY?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.430
NOTHING OTHER THAN
TO PASS THE MESSAGE
ON TO YOU AND ONLY YOU.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.302
AT LEAST I THINK
IT'S YOU.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.912
TIPSTER SAID TO PASS
THE MESSAGE ON

11:35.956 --> 11:38.523
TO AN AGENT PENNY DREADFUL.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.830
DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

11:40.874 --> 11:42.614
UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOES.

11:52.276 --> 11:55.236
I SEE YOU
GOT MY MESSAGE.

11:55.279 --> 11:59.631
OH, THE SAD DESPERATION
CAME THROUGH LOUD AND CLEAR.

11:59.675 --> 12:03.810
GOTHAM'S MOST DERANGED
DIVA REDUCED TO MAKING
PRANK PHONE CALLS.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.855
WHAT'S NEXT?
DING-DONG-DITCH?

12:05.899 --> 12:08.118
HEH. HOW ABOUT GHOST
IN THE GRAVEYARD?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.730
OH, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA KILL ME.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.428
YOU'D JUST BE
LONELY AGAIN.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.953
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
I'M HERE, ISN'T IT,

12:16.997 --> 12:18.738
WITH KATE GONE

12:18.781 --> 12:22.872
BECAUSE NO ONE REALLY CARES
ABOUT YOUR EVERY MOVE.

12:22.916 --> 12:27.921
I MEAN, THE NEW BATWOMAN
DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT YOU ANYMORE,

12:27.964 --> 12:32.664
AND THAT MUST DRIVE
YOU ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

12:32.708 --> 12:36.103
WELL, CRAZIER.

12:36.146 --> 12:41.499
WHAT WILL ALICE BECOME
NOW THAT HER SISTER
IS DEAD, HMM?

12:41.543 --> 12:43.588
I MEAN, IT'S THE AGE-OLD
QUESTION, ISN'T IT?

12:43.632 --> 12:46.766
IF A LUNATIC THROWS
A TANTRUM IN A FOREST,

12:46.809 --> 12:48.680
WILL ANYONE HEAR?

12:51.248 --> 12:53.511
GUESS GOTHAM'S NOT
MUCH OF A PLAYGROUND
WITHOUT A PLAYMATE.

12:53.555 --> 12:56.645
I DON'T NEED A PLAYMATE.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.299
I NEED A PARTNER.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.822
WELL, YOUR LAST
OVERTURE AT PARTNERS

12:59.866 --> 13:01.606
ENDED WITH A KNIFE
IN MY GUT, SO...

13:01.650 --> 13:05.001
OH, I REALLY NEED TO WORK
ON MY NEGOTIATING SKILLS.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.655
HOW ABOUT THIS?

13:06.698 --> 13:12.008
YOU HELP ME,
AND I'LL LEAVE
GOTHAM...FOREVER.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.402
GO ON. WHY WOULD
I BELIEVE YOU?

13:14.445 --> 13:17.753
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HELP ME
IN RIDDING MYSELF

13:17.797 --> 13:20.538
OF ANY REASON TO STAY.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.845
SEE, I NEED TO FIND
A PARTICULAR ASSOCIATE

13:22.889 --> 13:24.716
OF OUR MUTUAL FRIEND
SAFIYAH.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.982
SHE GOES BY THE CATCHY,
LITTLE PSEUDONYM OF ENIGMA.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.375
NEVER HEARD OF HER,
BUT IF YOU WANT
HER DEAD,

13:31.419 --> 13:33.377
SHE CAN'T BE
ALL BAD.

13:33.421 --> 13:38.513
ACTUALLY, SHE'S
QUITE GOOD...

13:38.556 --> 13:40.994
AT A CERTAIN SKILL
THAT I REQUIRE.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.300
WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

13:43.344 --> 13:46.651
HYPNOTISM, SPECIFICALLY
THE ABILITY

13:46.695 --> 13:50.264
TO ERASE MEMORIES,
ALTER OTHERS.

13:50.307 --> 13:55.008
HMM. LOOKING TO PURGE
OUR GUILTY CONSCIENCE,
ARE WE,

13:55.051 --> 13:57.662
LEAVE GOTHAM
WITH A CLEAN SLATE?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.577
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.275
WELL, HOW DO YOU
EVEN KNOW THAT
THIS ENIGMA

14:01.318 --> 14:02.842
CAN DO ALL THAT?

14:02.885 --> 14:04.844
BECAUSE SHE'S DONE IT
TO ME BEFORE.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.541
IT AS A FLUKE THAT
I FOUND OUT REALLY.

14:06.584 --> 14:09.892
ENIGMA ERASED ANY TRACE
THAT SHE'D EVER BEEN THERE.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.634
HEH. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD
SAY THAT I FORGOT TO REMEMBER

14:12.677 --> 14:14.375
WHAT SHE MADE ME FORGET.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.205
HOW IS THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?

14:18.248 --> 14:21.817
YOU CAN ASK HER
WHEN WE FIND HER.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.909
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.432
I THINK I ALREADY HAVE.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.914
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
COMMANDER?

14:31.958 --> 14:33.655
YEAH. COME IN, DR. RHYME
COME IN.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.440
-EVELYN, PLEASE.
-HEH HEH.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.878
I, UM--I JUST
WANTED TO THANK YOU

14:38.921 --> 14:40.836
FOR TAKING TIME AWAY
FROM YOUR PRACTICE

14:40.880 --> 14:43.752
TO LEND YOUR EXPERTISE
TO OUR SNAKEBITE
TASKFORCE.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.536
-MY PLEASURE.
-I READ YOUR REPORT

14:45.580 --> 14:48.104
ON WHAT MAKES SNAKEBITE
SO INCREDIBLY ADDICTIVE,

14:48.148 --> 14:50.063
THOUGH I ADMIT I GOT
A LITTLE BIT LOST

14:50.106 --> 14:51.891
IN THE MEDICAL JARGON.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.067
COULD YOU JUST--
COULD YOU JUST BREAK
IT DOWN FOR A GUY

14:54.110 --> 14:58.071
WHO DOESN'T HAVE A Ph.D.
IN CRIMINAL PSYCHIATRY?

14:58.114 --> 15:00.073
THE DRUG ATTACKS
THE HIPPOCAMPUS,

15:00.116 --> 15:02.553
WHERE THE BRAIN STORES
MEMORIES AND EMOTIONS.

15:02.597 --> 15:06.253
IT TARGETS THE MEMORIES
MOST ASSOCIATED
WITH REGRET AND REMORSE,

15:06.296 --> 15:08.342
WHICH RESULT
IN A HALLUCINATION

15:08.385 --> 15:14.261
THAT ALLOWS THE USER
TO ALTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THOSE MEMORIES.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.784
TO GET A DO-OVER.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.220
AND WHAT COULD BE
MORE ADDICTIVE THAN THAT,

15:17.264 --> 15:19.788
THE CHANCE TO RIGHT
OUR WORST MISTAKES,

15:19.831 --> 15:23.661
TO ERASE OUR GRAVEST SINS
EVEN FOR A MOMENT?

15:29.058 --> 15:31.931
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
USING SNAKEBITE, COMMANDER?

15:34.629 --> 15:36.109
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:40.026 --> 15:44.639
COMMANDER KANE,
IF WE'RE NOT HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER,

15:44.682 --> 15:51.167
THEN THIS IS JUST
A WASTE OF...BOTH
OF OUR TIME.

15:51.211 --> 15:55.955
SOME FALSE FACE BASTARD
JUMPED ME IN MY CAR,
CHLOROFORMED ME.

15:55.998 --> 16:00.220
I WOKE UP
WITH AN INJECTOR
IN MY ARM.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.091
I GUESS SINCE
I'VE BEEN RAILING
AGAINST SNAKEBITE

16:02.135 --> 16:05.573
IN THE PRESS
THEY WANTED TO
SEND ME A MESSAGE.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.186
HOW COULD YOU TELL?

16:10.230 --> 16:13.842
BECAUSE I'M VERY GOOD
AT MY JOB,

16:13.885 --> 16:17.237
AND EVEN IF YOU'VE HAD
JUST ONE DOSE,

16:17.280 --> 16:19.065
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MY HELP.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.734
SNEAKING OUT
THE BACKDOOR?

16:36.778 --> 16:38.345
I'M JUST GLAD
IT'S YOU.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.173
SAID NO
SUSPICIOUS DUDE EVER.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.305
-EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE?
-YEAH.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.307
A GUY PACKING
A HANDHELD LIGHTNING STORM.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.830
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD
OF HIM.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.876
YEAH. SO WHO IS HE?

16:47.919 --> 16:50.966
-I DON'T KNOW.
-BUT YOU KNOW HIS SCHEDULE.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.360
HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS GONNA ATTACK
THE COMMUNITY CENTER?

16:53.403 --> 16:55.231
BECAUSE IT'S
HAPPENED BEFORE.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.538
NOT BY KILOVOLT.
HE'S JUST
THE LATEST PLAYER

16:57.581 --> 16:59.235
IN A GAME THAT'S
BEEN GOING ON
FOR A WHILE.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.759
-I'M NOT FOLLOWING.
-NOBODY IS.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.458
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
COMMUNITY CENTERS
ARE BEING TERRORIZED.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.416
THE NARROWS
MIDNIGHT BASKETBALL

17:06.460 --> 17:08.549
GETS TORCHED
BY AN ARSONIST.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.942
DIAMOND DISTRICT
TUTORING CENTER
GETS SHOT UP.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.423
ANYTHING THAT WAS
A REFUGE FOR KIDS--

17:13.467 --> 17:16.035
TCH--TAKEN
OFF THE BOARD.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.819
MMM. NOT SEEING
A CONNECTION.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.821
THEY'RE ALL
DIFFERENT M.O.s.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.736
I'M TELLING YOU
THE SHELDON PARK ATTACK

17:21.779 --> 17:23.520
WASN'T THE FIRST,
AND IT WON'T BE THE LAST.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.001
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
AT-RISK YOUTH PROGRAMS,

17:26.045 --> 17:29.657
NOT EXACTLY THE MOST
THREATENING INSTITUTIONS
IN GOTHAM.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.920
WHAT'S THE MOTIVE?

17:31.963 --> 17:34.009
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE QUESTION
I WAS ASKING

17:34.053 --> 17:35.402
WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY
FIRED FROM THE "GAZETTE."

17:35.445 --> 17:36.577
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.274
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.453
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK,
MY EDITOR'S AGREED
TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.055
PUT HIM ON HERE.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.231
UP. UP.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.624
OK.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.934
THIRD-DEGREE
ELECTRICAL BURNS.

18:29.978 --> 18:31.371
SEE IF THE CROWS
LEFT US

18:31.414 --> 18:32.546
ANY MAFENIDE
ACETATE CREAM.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.156
CABINET MIDDLE SHELF.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.528
OH! I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SEDATE HIM.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.661
-BUT HE'LL MAKE IT?
-I THINK SO.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.751
LOOKS LIKE HIS LAPTOP
TOOK THE BRUNT OF IT.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.057
SOMEONE WENT TO A LOT
OF TROUBLE TO DESTROY
THE EVIDENCE

19:06.101 --> 19:08.234
ON THIS COMPUTER,

19:08.277 --> 19:12.629
WHICH MEANS THERE MUST BE
SOME TRUTH TO THE STORY
HE WAS TRYING TO TELL.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.682
FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT
THING CAME FROM?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.205
WELL, IT MATCHES
SOME TECH BEING SOLD

19:23.249 --> 19:25.207
BY A SHADY RUSSIAN
DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.

19:25.251 --> 19:29.211
I'M GUESSING THE KIND
THAT DOESN'T GIVE UP
THEIR CLIENT LIST.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.691
WE MAY NOT NEED IT.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.519
GOT A PARTIAL PRINT HERE.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.391
THE REST IS HIDDEN
UNDER THE BATTERY.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.221
AT LEAST I THINK
IT'S THE BATTERY.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.136
ARE YOU SURE YOU SHOULD
BE MESSING WITH THAT?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.094
RELAX. HEH.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.750
OOH. OK. UM, I...

19:52.060 --> 19:54.323
SEE? NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.020
UH-HUH.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.202
LET'S FIND OUT WHO
YOU ARE, KILOVOLT.

20:08.990 --> 20:12.428
MICHAEL KASTRINOS,
AKA MICKEY K.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.690
GOT AN ADDRESS?

20:16.302 --> 20:19.522
YEP. CELL BLOCK J
AT EDGEWATER PRISON,

20:19.566 --> 20:22.612
WHERE HE'S BEEN
LOCKED UP FOR
THE LAST TWO YEARS.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.964
SO YOU WERE
IN BORING MADRID

20:27.008 --> 20:29.053
FILING BORING PAPERWORK
BEFORE TAKING

20:29.097 --> 20:31.795
A BORING FLIGHT
BACK TO GOTHAM.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.580
AND FROM THERE, I FOLLOWED
THE TRAIL TO BLUDHAVEN,

20:33.623 --> 20:36.235
WHERE I EVENTUALLY FOUND
KATE'S REMAINS.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.326
NOT ACCORDING TO
YOUR BOARDING PASS,

20:40.369 --> 20:43.285
WHICH YOU APPARENTLY
USED AS AN ITINERARY.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.113
BEFORE HEADING OFF
TO BLUDHAVEN,
YOU HAD A MEETING

20:45.156 --> 20:47.768
WITH A DR. EVELYN RHYME.

20:47.811 --> 20:50.988
YOU DON'T
REMEMBER THAT?

20:51.032 --> 20:53.295
NO.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.123
DR. RHYME IS A CONSULTANT

20:55.166 --> 20:57.168
WITH THE CROWS'
SNAKEBITE TASKFORCE.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.345
WHY WOULD I WANT TO
TALK TO HER?

20:59.388 --> 21:03.000
WHAT SAY YOU FLY
TO THE NEST AND ASK
DR. RHYME.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.828
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

21:04.872 --> 21:06.917
SHE HAS
A PRIVATE PRACTICE
ON SIXTH, AND...

21:06.961 --> 21:09.442
I'M FEELING NOSY.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.793
SEE? WE MAKE
A GREAT TEAM.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.316
OH, COME ON.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.625
WE AREN'T SO DIFFERENT
YOU AND I.

21:18.668 --> 21:22.193
ALL WE HAVE IN COMMON
IS THAT WE BOTH MISS KATE.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.588
WELL, THERE IS
ONE OTHER THING.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.198
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE BOTH LOVED KATE

21:27.242 --> 21:30.071
SHE ALWAYS CHOSE
SOMEONE ELSE.

21:30.114 --> 21:34.554
OH. IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT ENIGMA TO ERASE,

21:34.597 --> 21:36.773
ALL THOSE
HURT FEELINGS?

21:36.817 --> 21:38.122
NO.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.998
I WANT HER TO ERASE...

21:44.041 --> 21:46.566
THE PERSON
WHO CAUSED THEM.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.660
THAT WAS MY LIFE'S
BIGGEST REGRET,

21:53.703 --> 21:58.317
MY GREATEST FAILURE,
NOT SAVING BETH.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.407
NOT AN HOUR GOES BY
THAT I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,

22:01.450 --> 22:05.976
LEAVING MY DAUGHTER
TO SUFFER IN THAT CELL.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.283
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T
SHAKE OFF THIS URGE

22:08.327 --> 22:09.937
FOR ANOTHER HIT
OF SNAKEBITE

22:09.980 --> 22:15.551
BECAUSE FOR ANOTHER
FEW FLEETING MOMENTS

22:15.595 --> 22:19.816
I GET TO BE THE FATHER
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO HER
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

22:19.860 --> 22:23.037
WHO ELSE HAVE YOU
TOLD ABOUT THIS?

22:23.080 --> 22:25.866
-NO ONE.
-NOT EVEN FAMILY?

22:25.909 --> 22:29.783
MY DAUGHTER MARY'S
THE ONLY FAMILY
I HAVE LEFT.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.002
WE'RE NOT
EXACTLY SPEAKING.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.353
UNFORTUNATELY,

22:34.396 --> 22:36.267
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN GIVE YOU

22:36.311 --> 22:38.792
TO BLUNT
THE WITHDRAWAL,

22:38.835 --> 22:41.490
BUT THERE IS A WAY
YOU CAN BLUNT THE PAIN

22:41.534 --> 22:43.362
OF THE DAUGHTER
YOU LOST.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.582
HOW?

22:46.626 --> 22:48.889
BY FOCUSING
ON REPAIRING
THE RELATIONSHIP

22:48.932 --> 22:50.978
WITH THE DAUGHTER
YOU HAVE LEFT.

22:53.284 --> 22:54.982
-MAN,
-GARCIA,
HOUSED ON "A" BLOCK.

22:58.028 --> 23:00.857
GARCIA, HOUSED ON "A" BLOCK.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.301
YOU MY NEW LAWYER?

23:10.345 --> 23:12.173
I WANTED TO ASK
ABOUT THE RECENT ATTACK

23:12.216 --> 23:14.349
ON THE SHELDON PARK
COMMUNITY CENTER.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.785
WHO ARE YOU?

23:15.829 --> 23:18.440
AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF HORTEN SPENCE.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.835
I DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER ANY OF YOUR
QUESTIONS, BITCH.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.146
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.366
HE DID IT.
MICKEY K.'s KILOVOLT.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.541
HE CAN'T BE.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.064
THE GUY HAS A LACERATION
RIGHT

23:34.108 --> 23:36.110
WHERE I SLICED HIM
IN THE ALLEY. IT'S HIM.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.633
NOT ACCORDING
TO THE PRISON
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.287
I'M CURRENTLY LOOKING
AT FOOTAGE

23:39.330 --> 23:40.854
FROM THE NIGHTS
OF BOTH KILOVOLT ATTACKS.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.422
MICKEY K. IS LOCKED UP
TIGHT IN HIS CELL.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.877
TWO VISITS IN ONE WEEK?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.880
AREN'T I THE BELLE
OF THE BLOCK?

24:06.923 --> 24:11.406
I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU CAN HELP
ME WITH SOMETHING.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.670
GRAPEVINE BUZZING
ABOUT ANY RECENT
PRISON ESCAPES,

24:14.714 --> 24:18.500
ANY RUMORS
OF A SECRET WAY
IN OR OUT OF HERE?

24:18.544 --> 24:19.719
YOU THINK IF I KNEW
A WAY OUT

24:19.762 --> 24:22.896
I'D STILL BE SITTING HERE?

24:22.939 --> 24:24.985
WHY DO YOU ASK?

24:25.028 --> 24:26.943
THINKING OF BUSTING
ME OUT?

24:26.987 --> 24:30.512
YOU KNOW, I WOULD DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU,

24:30.556 --> 24:32.383
BUT THE ONE THING
I CAN'T DO IS

24:32.427 --> 24:34.473
CONVINCE YOU TO PUNCH
YOUR TICKET OUT OF HERE.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.911
COME ON, ANG.
THE SHOOTERS WERE
WEARING A HOCKEY MASK

24:37.954 --> 24:39.956
AND A GAS MASK.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.567
GIVE ME THE NAMES
OF THE GUYS UNDERNEATH.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.482
IF I TELL YOU THEIR NAMES,
I'LL BE THE NEXT ONE

24:43.525 --> 24:45.179
BLACK MASK PUTS
A BULLET IN.

24:45.222 --> 24:48.138
BATWOMAN CAN'T BE AROUND
TO PROTECT ME 24 HOURS A DAY.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.662
BUT I CAN.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.584
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME

24:58.627 --> 25:01.238
AGAINST THE WORLD

25:01.282 --> 25:02.675
LIKE ALWAYS.

25:08.463 --> 25:11.205
I WILL NEVER LET
BLACK MASK HURT YOU.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.302
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.914
DOES ANYONE ELSE
WANT TO APOLOGIZE

25:24.958 --> 25:26.829
FOR THE FACT THAT
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS

25:26.873 --> 25:29.049
NOT A SINGLE VIABLE DOSE
OF SNAKEBITE

25:29.092 --> 25:30.529
HAS BEEN PRODUCED?

25:31.747 --> 25:33.314
ANYONE?

25:33.357 --> 25:35.708
I GOT PLENTY OF BULLETS
TO GO AROUND.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.885
SIR, YOU CAN
KILL AS MANY OF US AS YOU WANT.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.582
IT WON'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT YOU WANTED TO KEEP

25:40.626 --> 25:42.541
THE SNAKEBITE RECIPE
A SECRET,

25:42.584 --> 25:45.239
AND NOW WE'VE LOST THE ONLY
TWO PEOPLE WHO KNEW IT.

25:45.282 --> 25:46.936
OCEAN DISAPPEARED
WEEKS AGO,

25:46.980 --> 25:49.112
AND HIS LITTLE HELPER'S
LOCKED AWAY IN PRISON.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.114
HMM.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.036
YOU GOT TO GET
HER OUT.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.125
YOU CAN'T LET ANGELIQUE
ROT IN THERE.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.866
I SENT YOU THE NAMES
OF THE MEN WHO GUNNED
DOWN FORBES.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.825
I KNOW. I GOT ALL 6
OF YOUR VOICEMAILS.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.261
I'LL LOOK INTO THE NAMES
SHE GAVE ME.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.784
I ALREADY DID, OK?

26:08.828 --> 26:10.264
THEY MANAGE
THE GOTHAM GUN CLUB.

26:10.307 --> 26:11.961
IS IT THAT HARD TO IMAGINE
GUYS WHO WORK

26:12.005 --> 26:14.834
AT A SHOOTING RANGE
PULLING THE TRIGGER?

26:14.877 --> 26:17.358
-OK. I'LL RUN IT DOWN.
-AND?

26:17.401 --> 26:19.403
AND IF THE STORY
CHECKS OUT,

26:19.447 --> 26:21.971
I'LL TALK TO THE D.A.
ABOUT GETTING
YOUR GIRL SPRUNG.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.892
HEY.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.242
SO THIS IS FROM
THE NIGHT OF THE ATTACK
ON THE COMMUNITY CENTER,

26:32.286 --> 26:36.203
AND THIS IS
FROM TWO WEEKS AGO.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.379
NOW CHECK OUT
THE TWO HANDS
OF SOLITAIRE.

26:38.422 --> 26:41.643
THEY'RE IDENTICAL...
JUST LIKE THESE
SURVEILLANCE TAPES.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.253
IT'S THE SAME FOOTAGE.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.646
THEY JUST SLAPPED
A NEW TIME STAMP ON IT,

26:44.690 --> 26:46.517
AND INSTANT ALIBI.

26:46.561 --> 26:48.345
SO IS THE PRISON TRYING
TO COVER UP THE FACT

26:48.389 --> 26:50.391
THAT HE ESCAPED AND DESTROYED
THE COMMUNITY CENTER?

26:50.434 --> 26:53.046
WORSE. I THINK
THEY LET HIM OUT.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.135
OUR FIEND MICKEY K. HERE
WASN'T GONNA BE ELIGIBLE

26:55.178 --> 26:56.919
FOR PAROLE
FOR ANOTHER DECADE,

26:56.963 --> 26:58.660
AND THEN SUDDENLY
THE DAY AFTER

26:58.704 --> 27:00.575
THE COMMUNITY CENTER
ATTACK,

27:00.619 --> 27:02.751
HE WAS GRANTED
A HEARING
FOR EARLY RELEASE.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.492
SO...

27:06.494 --> 27:08.757
I TOOK THE SCHEDULE
FOR RECENT PAROLE HEARINGS,

27:08.801 --> 27:10.716
AND I MATCHED IT
AGAINST SPENCE'S LIST

27:10.759 --> 27:12.848
OF ATTACKS
ON COMMUNITY PROGRAMS.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.633
GUESS WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE NARROWS
MIDNIGHT BASKETBALL

27:14.676 --> 27:16.460
WAS TORCHED.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.288
THEY PAROLED
A SERIAL ARSONIST.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.507
AND HERE'S ANOTHER
BIG, WET KISS

27:19.550 --> 27:20.856
FROM EDGEWATER'S
PAROLE BOARD.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.860
THIS ONE AN ARMED
ROBBERY ENTHUSIAST

27:24.904 --> 27:26.819
CONVENIENTLY SCHEDULED--

27:26.862 --> 27:29.343
THE DAY AFTER
THE DIAMOND DISTRICT
TUTORING CENTER GOT SHOT UP.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.780
OK, OK. SO SOMEONE
FROM THE PRISON

27:31.824 --> 27:33.869
IS LETTING OUT CRIMINALS
FOR ONE NIGHT

27:33.913 --> 27:35.871
TO TARGET COMMUNITY PROGRAMS
IN EXCHANGE

27:35.915 --> 27:37.394
FOR EARLY PAROLE.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.961
AND THAT SOMEONE...

27:40.223 --> 27:41.877
IS EDGEWATER CORRECTIONAL

27:41.921 --> 27:43.487
CEO ELLIS O'BRIEN.

27:43.531 --> 27:45.054
HE PERSONALLY
INTERVENED

27:45.098 --> 27:47.100
AND SIGNED OFF
ON EACH EARLY RELEASE,

27:47.143 --> 27:49.493
ALL UNDER THE GUISE
OF "TIME OFF
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR,"

27:49.537 --> 27:51.408
AND HE SITS ON THE BOARD
OF THE "GOTHAM GAZETTE."

27:51.452 --> 27:54.673
WHICH PUTS HIM IN THE POSITION
TO GET HORTEN FIRED

27:54.716 --> 27:57.110
BEFORE HE CAN FIND OUT
WHO'S BEHIND THE ATTACKS.

27:57.153 --> 27:59.808
YEAH, BUT I STILL
DON'T GET WHY.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.419
WHY WOULD A PRISON COMPANY
WANT TO DESTROY

28:02.463 --> 28:04.073
COMMUNITY PROGRAMS?

28:04.117 --> 28:06.380
IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IMANI SAID.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.817
THESE PROGRAMS KEEP
KIDS FROM FALLING
THROUGH THE CRACKS,

28:08.861 --> 28:11.820
BUT YOU KNOW WHO PROFITS
FROM THE KIDS WHO DO?

28:11.864 --> 28:13.213
PRISONS.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.477
JAKE. HEY, BUDDY.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.609
LISTEN. I'M SORRY
TO BARGE IN LIKE THIS,

28:18.653 --> 28:21.264
WAVING MY CROWS
PLATINUM CLIENT CARD,

28:21.308 --> 28:22.962
BUT I JUST NEEDED
TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY

28:23.005 --> 28:24.659
I KNEW I COULD TRUST.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.269
WHAT'S WRONG, ROMAN?

28:26.313 --> 28:27.706
WELL, I WAS DONG
A ROUTINE CHECK

28:27.749 --> 28:29.229
ON ONE OF MY
COSMETICS STORES.

28:29.272 --> 28:31.274
LONG STORY SHORT,
A SEARCH OF ONE

28:31.318 --> 28:34.408
OF MY EMPLOYEES' LOCKERS
TURNED UP THIS.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.673
THAT'S SNAKEBITE,
RIGHT?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.370
I DIDN'T WANT TO
MAKE A BIG THING
ABOUT IT

28:40.414 --> 28:41.850
WITHOUT KNOWING
FOR SURE.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.286
I MEAN, I'VE HEARD
OF THE STUFF,

28:43.330 --> 28:45.724
BUT I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY SEEN IT.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.378
IS THAT THE REAL DEAL?

28:48.422 --> 28:51.251
UH, YEAH. YEAH.
IT'S THE REAL DEAL.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.775
WOW. WELL, IT'S GOOD
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU THEN.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.255
I KNOW HOW HARD YOU'VE
BEEN PUSHING TO GET

28:55.298 --> 28:56.735
THIS STUFF
OFF THE STREETS.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.954
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
MY OWN STAFF WOULD--

28:58.998 --> 29:02.436
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A KID DRUG,

29:02.479 --> 29:05.352
BUT THIS STUFF MUST
REALLY BE MAKING
THE ROUNDS, HUH?

29:05.395 --> 29:07.876
LISTEN. I'VE GOT
THINGS, UH, COVERED
ON MY END.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.009
CAN YOU DISPOSE OF THIS,
MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET

29:10.052 --> 29:11.750
INTO THE WRONG HANDS?

29:11.793 --> 29:13.534
I MEAN, IF IT'S
AS BAD AS YOU SAY,

29:13.577 --> 29:17.190
THIS STUFF COULD REALLY
RUIN SOMEONE'S LIFE.

29:17.233 --> 29:20.671
YEAH. I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.369
YOU'RE THE BEST,
JAKE.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.814
OH. DR. RHYME.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.686
AGENT PENNYWORTH,
HOW ARE YOU?

29:35.730 --> 29:37.384
STUMPED ACTUALLY.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.429
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
CLEAR SOMETHING UP.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.780
LAST MONTH WHEN I'D
JUST RETURNED TO GOTHAM,

29:41.823 --> 29:44.130
YOU ASKED TO SEE ME.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.827
THIS IS GONNA SOUND STRANGE,

29:45.871 --> 29:49.962
BUT, UM, DO YOU MIND
IF I ASK WHAT WE DISCUSSED?

29:50.005 --> 29:52.921
IT WAS A MATTER
OF SOME SENSITIVITY.

29:52.965 --> 29:57.056
OH. PERHAPS WE SHOULD
DISCUSS IT IN PRIVATE.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.840
MM-HMM.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.630
HAVE A SEAT,
DR. RHYME,

30:06.674 --> 30:08.458
OR WOULD YOU
PREFER ENIGMA?

30:15.161 --> 30:16.902
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO ME?

30:16.945 --> 30:18.991
SAME THING I'M ABOUT
TO DO.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.296
UNH!

30:20.340 --> 30:21.776
MAKE YOU FORGET.

30:34.441 --> 30:35.921
I GOT A LOCK
ON THE CEO's PHONE.

30:35.964 --> 30:36.965
HE SEEMS TO BE WORKING
LATE AT THE SITE

30:37.009 --> 30:39.838
OF EDGEWATER'S
LATEST LOCKUP.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.020
SURVEYING YOUR LATEST MONEY MAKER?

30:48.063 --> 30:49.499
WHO'S THERE?

30:53.547 --> 30:55.679
I NEED
A SECURITY TEAM DOWN--

30:55.723 --> 30:58.291
AHH!

30:58.334 --> 31:00.293
TELL ME HOW MUCH
MONEY DOES THE CITY

31:00.336 --> 31:03.339
PAY YOU PER PRISONER?

31:03.383 --> 31:05.254
150 A DAY.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.865
SO YOU'RE RAKING IN
A COUPLE HUNDRED
MILLION A YEAR

31:06.908 --> 31:08.257
TO WAREHOUSE PEOPLE?

31:08.301 --> 31:10.172
THERE'S NOTHING
ILLEGAL ABOUT IT.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.913
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
ALL THAT MONEY MEANS

31:11.957 --> 31:13.654
YOU'LL BE WILLING
TO DO ANYTHING

31:13.697 --> 31:15.612
TO KEEP YOUR CELLS FILLED.

31:15.656 --> 31:18.224
THAT'S WHY YOU SENT
KILOVOLT TO FRY
THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.879
ANY PROGRAMS THAT KEPT
AT-RISK KIDS

31:20.922 --> 31:22.924
FROM ENDING UP IN ONE
OF YOUR PRISONS

31:22.968 --> 31:24.752
CUT INTO YOUR
BOTTOM LINE,

31:24.795 --> 31:26.536
SO YOU TOOK THEM OUT.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.625
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT ME.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.497
NO NEED TO GET PHYSICAL.

31:30.540 --> 31:31.802
SO YOU'RE CONFESSING?

31:31.846 --> 31:33.369
MORE LIKE STALLING.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.374
ARE YOU SEEING THIS?

31:38.418 --> 31:40.289
YOU GOT 3 GUARDSAPPROACHING FROM THE WEST,

31:40.333 --> 31:42.291
AND I'M READING
A BIG ENERGY SIGNAL.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.868
THAT SUIT'LL
PROTECT HER, RIGHT?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.783
NOT AGAINST 3 OF THOSE
LIGHTNING GUNS IT WON'T.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.152
NOBODY'S HOME.

32:42.743 --> 32:45.920
LOOKS LIKE BLACK MASK IS
TYING UP SOME LOOSE ENDS.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.164
I MISS
THE ELECTRIC CHAIR,

33:12.207 --> 33:14.949
BUT A FIRING SQUAD
SHOULD DO.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.170
READY...AIM...

33:18.213 --> 33:19.693
FIRE!

33:30.486 --> 33:32.271
YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING OUT
ON ME, FOX?

33:32.314 --> 33:34.099
COULDN'T LET YOU HAVE
ALL THE FUN.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.710
-YOU KNOW I HAD THAT, RIGHT?
-YEAH. NEVER HAD A DOUBT.

33:40.018 --> 33:40.670
DO YOU LIKE
IRONY, GOTHAM?

33:40.714 --> 33:42.020
I THINK BATWOMAN DOES.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.022
FOR-PROFIT PRISON CEO
ELLIS O'BRIEN

33:44.065 --> 33:46.459
ALLEGEDLY ENGINEERED
A CONSPIRACY

33:46.502 --> 33:48.417
TO SABOTAGE
COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS

33:48.461 --> 33:50.593
IN A BID TO INCREASE
INCARCERATION RATES

33:50.637 --> 33:52.813
AMONG THE CITY'S MOST AT-RISK,

33:52.856 --> 33:55.163
AND IT SEEMS O'BRIEN DID
INCREASE THE PRISON POPULATION

33:55.207 --> 33:57.687
BY ONE--HIMSELF.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.298
BATWOMAN SPILLED THE TEA,

33:59.341 --> 34:02.083
AND JOURNALIST HORTEN SPENCE
SPILLED THE INK.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.519
TALK TO ME, GOTHAM.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.478
HAS BATWOMAN FOUND HER
LOIS LANE?

34:16.489 --> 34:17.838
HMM.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.388
AHCHOO!

35:12.153 --> 35:14.112
DADDY?

35:16.418 --> 35:20.161
WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO
THE GOOD DOCTOR RHYME'S OFFICE?

35:35.089 --> 35:37.004
-JACOB,
-THAT'S WHY
I CAN'T SHAKE THIS URGE

35:37.047 --> 35:38.832
FOR ANOTHER HIT OF SNAKEBITE
BECAUSE AT LEAST FOR A FEW--

35:38.875 --> 35:41.356
TSK, TSK, TSK.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

35:45.055 --> 35:48.450
THAT WAS MY LIFE'S
BIGGEST REGRET,

35:48.494 --> 35:51.540
MY GREATEST FAILURE,
NOT SAVING BETH.

35:51.584 --> 35:54.587
NOT AN HOUR GOES BY
WHEN I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,

35:54.630 --> 35:57.285
LEAVING MY DAUGHTER
TO SUFFER IN THAT CELL.

35:57.329 --> 35:58.808
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SHAKE
THIS URGE

35:58.852 --> 36:00.332
FOR ANOTHER HIT OF SNAKEBITE

36:00.375 --> 36:03.596
BECAUSE AT LEAST
FOR A FEW FLEETING MOMENTS

36:03.639 --> 36:05.598
I CAN BE THE FATHER
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO HER

36:05.641 --> 36:07.426
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.866
I'M SORRY, DADDY.

36:15.521 --> 36:19.046
AS MUCH AS I WANT TO
FORGIVE YOU...

36:20.961 --> 36:23.268
FORGETTING'S EASIER.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.498
APPLY THE ANTIBIOTIC
TWICE A DAY

36:36.542 --> 36:39.022
AND CHANGE THE BANDAGES
AS NEEDED.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.024
-THANKS.
-YEAH.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.591
UH, MY INSURANCE
DOESN'T KICK IN

36:42.635 --> 36:44.071
FOR ANOTHER FEW WEEKS.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.507
YEAH. I'M JUST GLAD
YOU GOT YOUR JOB BACK

36:45.551 --> 36:48.902
AND, I HEAR,
A BIG PROMOTION.

36:48.945 --> 36:52.253
ALL I HAVE TO TOAST
WITH ARE LOLLIPOPS,

36:52.297 --> 36:55.735
BUT CHEERS.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.389
-BYE.
-BYE.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.568
STOPPED BY THE MED SCHOOL,

37:02.611 --> 37:05.135
YOUR APARTMENT,
THE HOLD-UP.

37:05.179 --> 37:07.442
THEN IT HIT ME
WHERE I COULD FIND YOU.

37:07.486 --> 37:10.445
-BUSTED. YOU GOT ME.
-MARY.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.055
LOOK. I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY

37:12.099 --> 37:13.796
I'M OPENING
THE PLACE BACK UP,

37:13.840 --> 37:15.537
SO IF YOU WANT TO
STOP ME,

37:15.581 --> 37:17.191
YOU'LL HAVE TO
ARREST ME.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.888
I DON'T WANT TO STOP YOU.
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.716
MAKE THIS PLACE
A REAL CLINIC.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.805
HIRE REAL DOCTORS.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.894
I'LL EVEN PAY FOR IT.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.679
YOU KNOW THAT THERE
ARE SOME THINGS
THAT YOU CAN'T FIX

37:26.722 --> 37:28.071
BY WRITING A BIG CHECK.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.595
WHAT POSSIBLE OBJECTION
COULD YOU HAVE

37:29.638 --> 37:31.988
TO MAKING
THIS PLACE LEGIT?

37:32.032 --> 37:35.296
BECAUSE IT GOES
AGAINST THE VERY REASON
I STARTED THE CLINIC, OK?

37:35.340 --> 37:37.907
I DON'T ASK FOR I.D.,
I DON'T REQUIRE INSURANCE,

37:37.951 --> 37:40.649
I DON'T REPORT O.D.s
OR NON-VIOLENT
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.608
I OPENED UP THIS PLACE
TO SERVE THE PEOPLE

37:42.651 --> 37:44.914
THAT YOU DON'T SEE
AS LEGIT.

37:44.958 --> 37:47.830
COME ON. YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN FINISHED MED SCHOOL.

37:47.874 --> 37:50.311
AND YET YESTERDAY,
I SAVED A GUY'S LIFE,

37:50.355 --> 37:52.835
AND, YOU KNOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE KATE DIED,

37:52.879 --> 37:55.534
I DON'T FEEL HOLLOW.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.449
I FEEL LIKE
WHAT I DID MATTERED,

37:57.492 --> 37:59.451
THAT I CAN MAKE
A DIFFERENCE

37:59.494 --> 38:01.627
IN THIS CRAPPY CITY,

38:01.670 --> 38:03.803
AND YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT AWAY FROM ME,

38:03.846 --> 38:07.241
AND FOR THAT,
I WILL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.511
HEY.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.644
SO I HEARD YOU PUT IN
FOR A TRANSFER TO BERLIN.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.602
THAT I DID.

38:20.646 --> 38:21.908
SEEMS SUDDEN.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.605
I KNOW. HEH.

38:23.649 --> 38:26.129
I JUST, UM--I JUST
WOKE UP THIS MORNING

38:26.173 --> 38:29.611
AND KNEW THAT'S
WHAT I WANTED TO DO.

38:29.655 --> 38:32.266
IT JUST FEELS RIGHT,
YOU NOW?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.616
TOO MANY MEMORIES
HERE IN GOTHAM.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.401
HMM.

38:36.444 --> 38:37.967
TAKE CARE, LOVE.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.281
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAD A COPY OF THIS.

38:48.500 --> 38:52.025
AHH. I'M GLAD
THE PLACE IS GETTING
SOME GOOD PRESS.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.331
YEAH. THE PHONES HAVE
BEEN LIGHTING UP

38:53.374 --> 38:55.333
WITH DONATIONS
AND VOLUNTEERS.

38:55.376 --> 38:58.205
THAT MEANS I'M
OFF THE HOOK FOR
TEACHING MARTIAL ARTS?

38:58.248 --> 39:01.600
I HOPE NOT BECAUSE
I ALREADY SIGNED UP
FOR YOUR CLASS.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.216
EXCUSE ME.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.745
SO THIS IS ALL
HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY,

39:16.789 --> 39:19.748
BUT THE D.A. SIGNED OFF
ON ANGELIQUE'S DEAL.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.837
A WITSEC TEAM IS
MOVING HER INTO
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY

39:21.881 --> 39:23.709
AS WE SPEAK.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.885
-THANK YOU.
-NO. THANK YOU

39:25.928 --> 39:27.669
FOR GETTING HER
TO TALK.

39:27.713 --> 39:30.280
NOW UNTIL WE CAN
TAKE DOWN BLACK MASK,

39:30.324 --> 39:32.892
ANGELIQUE'S GONNA BE
OFF THE GRID FOR BIT.

39:32.935 --> 39:35.895
IT MIGHT BE A WHILE
BEFORE YOU CAN TALK
TO HER AGAIN.

40:14.150 --> 40:15.587
UNH!

40:26.249 --> 40:27.773
YOU CAME FOR ME!

40:30.689 --> 40:32.125
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.478
CROWS TREATING YOU OK?

40:37.522 --> 40:39.219
THEY'RE DEFINITELY

40:39.262 --> 40:42.962
MORE AGREEABLE
CHAUFFEURING ME AROUND.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.790
THANKS FOR GETTING ME OUT.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.748
YOU GOT
YOURSELF OUT.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.272
WITH A LITTLE PUSH.

40:49.316 --> 40:51.449
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
DID 18 MONTHS INSIDE, RY.

40:51.492 --> 40:55.365
I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD
HOW MUCH YOU SACRIFICED
FOR ME BY GOING IN.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.063
NOT EVEN CLOSE,

40:57.106 --> 41:00.762
BUT NOW THAT I DO,
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU

41:00.806 --> 41:03.765
AND THAT I LOVE YOU
