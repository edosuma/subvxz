[Soft instrumental music]

02:35.050 --> 02:37.127
[Soft instrumental music continues]

03:27.435 --> 03:29.512
[Horse neighs]

05:52.289 --> 05:53.950
I'm looking for John Russell.

05:55.959 --> 05:57.335
<i>Tres hombres.</i>

05:58.712 --> 06:00.789
Ish-kay-nay, or whatever you call him.

06:17.856 --> 06:20.182
I guess you must be John Russell.

06:20.358 --> 06:23.146
Unless one of them is.
I can't tell you apart.

06:23.695 --> 06:27.314
- I'm Russell. Who are you?
- Billy Lee Blake. I work for Henry Mendez.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.990
If he sent you for horses
all we got is greens.

06:31.119 --> 06:35.332
We won't need any more horses.
The stage line is being closed.

06:36.708 --> 06:38.666
You're a bit out of touch here, ain't you?

06:40.045 --> 06:41.504
Then, what do you want?

06:41.838 --> 06:45.837
Mr. Mendez wants to see you.
He's waiting at Delgado's Station.

06:45.925 --> 06:47.302
He told me to tell you.

06:47.385 --> 06:48.964
All right. You've told me.

06:50.597 --> 06:53.765
Give me my horse,
so I can get out of here before dark.

06:54.225 --> 06:58.473
- Are you afraid of it?
- I don't like what I see in the daylight here.

07:00.315 --> 07:01.644
Go ahead.

07:11.034 --> 07:13.028
[Soft instrumental music]

07:51.408 --> 07:52.450
MENDEZ: <i>Â¡Hombre!</i>

07:53.827 --> 07:55.655
Which name today, which do you want?

07:56.162 --> 07:58.322
RUSSELL: Anything but "bastard" will do.

07:59.416 --> 08:02.750
We'll use John Russell.
No Apache names, no symbol names.

08:04.087 --> 08:05.130
All right.

08:05.672 --> 08:07.749
Come inside. We'll have some mescal.

08:14.597 --> 08:16.425
RUSSELL: You get home all right?

08:21.146 --> 08:23.139
RUSSELL: I hear you're out of work.

08:23.773 --> 08:28.317
I've bought my last horse from you.
The notices go up this week.

08:29.154 --> 08:31.823
After twenty years,
the railroad is coming to Sweetmary.

08:32.323 --> 08:35.775
It's progress, my friend.
Change. It's the law of life.

08:37.828 --> 08:40.285
Anyway, I brought you here
about something else.

08:41.499 --> 08:45.284
I thought you'd want to know
that Mr. Russell died three nights ago.

08:46.671 --> 08:48.332
He went in his sleep.

08:53.511 --> 08:55.505
Doesn't that affect you? He raised you.

08:56.681 --> 09:01.012
- Seventy-eight years is a long life.
- He was an old man, not a bad one, either.

09:03.396 --> 09:07.775
He left you his watch,
and a boarding house in Sweetmary.

09:08.777 --> 09:11.446
It's two stories high. I live there myself.

09:13.031 --> 09:15.523
This is something big to think about.

09:16.493 --> 09:17.535
Why?

09:17.702 --> 09:22.282
You can live among white men again,
on land that a white man has given you.

09:22.540 --> 09:26.622
You've been up in the mountains too long.
It's time to come down, speak English...

09:26.711 --> 09:29.630
no matter what language you think in.
And get a haircut.

09:31.132 --> 09:32.175
Why?

09:32.550 --> 09:36.466
There's something to be gained.
Something to your advantage.

09:37.138 --> 09:38.682
<i>At least, go look at it.</i>

09:39.099 --> 09:43.311
<i>But I think that if you
see it, you'll keep it.</i>

09:46.648 --> 09:50.314
And there's a woman running it.
A good-looking woman.

09:53.363 --> 09:54.775
Do I inherit her, too?

09:56.574 --> 10:02.614
No, my friend. That's up to you.
You can be white or Indian or Mexican.

10:04.165 --> 10:07.582
It pays you to be a white man for a while.
Go to Sweetmary.

10:08.128 --> 10:12.126
Say, "How are you? I am John Russell,
I own the Russell place."

10:12.465 --> 10:14.874
Put yourself on the winning side,
for a change.

10:17.554 --> 10:18.930
Is that where you are?

10:21.349 --> 10:24.802
A Mexican is closer than a white man
to an Apache. I can say that.

10:31.901 --> 10:33.231
How old is she?

10:42.996 --> 10:44.491
Hey, Mexico.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.958
You got a bottle back there?

10:49.878 --> 10:54.292
EARLY: I guess anybody can come in here.
LAMAR: Yeah, if they allow Indians.

10:54.966 --> 10:57.541
EARLY: When did they start
letting Indians drink?

10:59.554 --> 11:03.220
Maybe they been drinking
that Apache slop made from cactus juice.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.593
- Tiswin?
- Yeah, that's right, tiswin.

11:08.605 --> 11:12.734
- Maybe it gave them the nerve to come in.
- It would take a week with tiswin.

11:13.610 --> 11:16.481
They have time.
What else have they got to do?

11:31.711 --> 11:34.334
That ain't tiswin. That's mescal.

11:43.306 --> 11:47.637
Yeah, that's mescal.
That's still not allowed.

11:49.145 --> 11:52.515
Not even sticky, sweet Mex drinks.
Not for Indians.

12:06.204 --> 12:07.450
LAMAR: Look at that.

12:09.207 --> 12:11.876
- They just can't hold their liquor.
- They sure can't.

12:17.799 --> 12:21.549
Nobody knows why.
It's just a fact of nature.

12:41.906 --> 12:42.949
No more.

12:46.911 --> 12:50.447
Before you leave,
put money on the bar for a mescal.

12:59.591 --> 13:01.169
Next time, I'll drop you!

13:19.402 --> 13:24.398
I talk about bringing you to a house
with flowerpots in the window...

13:25.367 --> 13:27.028
and napkins on the table.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.163
A savage.

13:31.373 --> 13:34.624
I don't know why you say that.
I was thinking about it in English.

13:57.857 --> 14:01.025
It's so hot out there,
that wash dried while I was hanging it.

14:01.194 --> 14:05.145
- I don't think this meat is fresh.
- Don't think about it, just cook it.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.368
It smells funny.
Do you think it'll be all right?

14:08.660 --> 14:13.157
JESSIE: If you put a lot of chili peppers
into it. I wouldn't eat it myself on a bet.

14:48.575 --> 14:51.826
- What's going on?
- I'm moving you out.

14:52.746 --> 14:58.287
I want you to take your socks,
your cigar stubs, your long johns...

14:58.501 --> 15:03.211
and sheriff's badge, and amble
back down the hall to your own room.

15:05.050 --> 15:06.545
I like it here.

15:07.052 --> 15:10.054
I can't remember
how you got squatter's rights in here.

15:10.639 --> 15:14.637
Seems you came by
to get an extra blanket, and stayed a year.

15:14.726 --> 15:19.270
- You're worried about public opinion?
- My public is getting bigger than usual.

15:20.357 --> 15:25.103
- The new owner is coming today.
- What the hell is he, a preacher?

15:25.528 --> 15:27.688
He might not understand this arrangement.

15:28.281 --> 15:32.066
- I'm not sure I do.
- I don't like this.

15:32.452 --> 15:35.537
- I didn't think you'd be crazy about it.
- I don't like it at all.

15:35.622 --> 15:39.870
Humor me. I just want
to keep up appearances for a while.

15:40.251 --> 15:45.128
- Nothing to get sulky about.
- You can't move me around like furniture.

15:46.132 --> 15:47.758
I might not come back.

15:48.426 --> 15:52.377
Sure you will, Frank. Where else
will you put your big, cold feet?

15:56.309 --> 15:57.591
Are you kids up?

15:57.686 --> 16:01.352
JESSIE: Coffee's on!
BILLY: All right. She wants us down.

16:02.565 --> 16:07.027
- So what? We're paying the rent.
- Are you going to lie here all day?

16:08.905 --> 16:10.365
I might.

16:11.992 --> 16:15.658
I calculate you spend
about 17 hours out of 24 in bed.

16:16.413 --> 16:17.991
I need a lot of sleep.

16:18.790 --> 16:21.459
Will you come out to see your shadow
on Groundhog Day?

16:22.127 --> 16:23.752
What is there to get up for?

16:24.087 --> 16:27.124
I don't have anybody to talk to, or visit.

16:28.383 --> 16:31.919
The only excitement here is
watching Jessie kill a chicken for dinner.

16:32.804 --> 16:37.348
BILLY: If you want something to do,
why not darn the holes in my socks?

16:37.809 --> 16:40.266
Darns raise blisters. Buy some new ones.

16:40.937 --> 16:44.556
- You must think I'm made of money.
- If you are, I never see any of it.

16:45.317 --> 16:48.520
- Now I'm cheap?
- This isn't what you promised me.

16:48.612 --> 16:51.946
I promised to do my best.
What did you think married life would be?

16:52.240 --> 16:55.242
Getting away from a hardscrabble ranch
on the Rogue River.

16:55.327 --> 16:59.195
Away from my old man who never raised
anything but kids and bad luck.

17:03.376 --> 17:06.497
- The love-making is fine, isn't it?
- No, it isn't fine!

17:06.796 --> 17:10.249
It's mostly something you want to do,
without even taking a shave.

17:12.093 --> 17:15.759
You don't want kids,
or to keep house, or even to sleep with me.

17:16.388 --> 17:19.723
BILLY: I'd do better to get a yellow dog
to keep me company!

17:28.568 --> 17:32.270
I'd like to see these forks just once
without yesterday's dried egg on them.

17:37.869 --> 17:42.662
- The walls of this house are paper thin.
- What's that supposed to mean?

17:43.041 --> 17:46.625
It means you can hear everything
through them. And I mean everything.

17:48.254 --> 17:49.631
BILLY: We fight a lot.

17:51.174 --> 17:54.295
- What's wrong with you two?
- What isn't?

17:58.765 --> 18:00.509
What did you get married for?

18:02.227 --> 18:04.470
So you could share the same bed?

18:06.314 --> 18:07.357
I guess.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.440
That part of it won't
last, believe it or not.

18:12.362 --> 18:15.115
She'll get fat. You'll get old. Then, what?

18:16.324 --> 18:18.899
I'm not worried about then,
I'm worried about now.

18:19.619 --> 18:23.155
You try living with 24 hours of
bellyaching. See how you like it.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.660
That's the price if you want it
where you can nudge it in the night.

18:30.505 --> 18:32.048
Time to go to work.

18:34.009 --> 18:35.051
Well.

18:36.177 --> 18:39.761
I see the silver is being polished
for Mr. Russell.

18:40.181 --> 18:41.842
What's wrong with that?

18:42.684 --> 18:44.927
Who are you doing all this for?

18:45.604 --> 18:48.641
A man who was carried off by the Apaches
as a child...

18:49.232 --> 18:51.901
raised among red devils
to be a red devil.

18:52.402 --> 18:55.570
Is that what will sleep
in the brass bed in my front bedroom?

18:55.655 --> 18:57.732
I'll tell you more about him.

18:58.491 --> 19:01.992
When old Russell found him among
some Army prisoners at Fort Thomas...

19:02.078 --> 19:06.492
and took him home, gave him his name,
this ingrate ran away.

19:06.583 --> 19:10.534
<i>He returned to the Apache. He had no use</i>
<i>for the white man and his ways.</i>

19:12.005 --> 19:14.960
So, don't waste your time with this.

19:17.135 --> 19:19.093
He eats with his fingers.

19:19.763 --> 19:22.468
JESSIE: When I'm done with him
he'll eat out of my hand.

19:22.557 --> 19:23.600
You think so?

19:45.455 --> 19:46.998
JESSIE: Mr. Russell?

19:49.125 --> 19:51.415
I'm Jessie Brown. I've been expecting you.

19:54.506 --> 19:56.131
Your gate is off the hinge.

19:56.549 --> 20:00.714
JESSIE: I know. I've been meaning to do
something about it sometime or other.

20:01.304 --> 20:03.381
Well, come in. We can't talk here.

20:09.646 --> 20:11.723
[Door hinge squeaks loudly]

20:13.692 --> 20:17.773
I hear it.
The roof's got a nice, big leak, too.

20:18.530 --> 20:21.567
If it were raining,
you'd drown where you're standing.

20:22.284 --> 20:24.989
- But it's not raining.
- Doesn't appear to be.

20:30.166 --> 20:33.168
JESSIE: This house has ten rooms,
two flights of stairs...

20:33.295 --> 20:36.795
and one woman
to keep it all nailed down. That's me.

20:37.007 --> 20:38.049
All right.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.707
Would you like to see
the rest of the house?

20:42.887 --> 20:45.462
<i>There's nothing else to see,</i>
<i>except me and the books.</i>

20:46.141 --> 20:49.059
You've already had a fairly critical
look at me.

20:50.729 --> 20:52.473
Then, show me the books.

20:56.568 --> 20:59.771
You might like to know
that old man Russell had a fine funeral.

21:00.447 --> 21:04.280
Everyone in the house chipped in
to buy a horseshoe of red carnations.

21:04.367 --> 21:07.073
<i>They didn't last long in the heat,</i>
<i>but they were pretty.</i>

21:08.038 --> 21:11.408
<i>And we got him a marble headstone.</i>
<i>It has his name on it.</i>

21:12.125 --> 21:17.037
And underneath, "In the fullness
of his years." Is that all right?

21:17.422 --> 21:21.551
- I'd settle for that on my own slab.
- What do you figure yours will read?

21:22.052 --> 21:23.167
"Shot dead."

21:24.512 --> 21:28.262
- Don't people like you?
- It only takes one of a dozen.

21:32.187 --> 21:36.933
Let's assume you'll have a future.
How about going into business with me?

21:37.359 --> 21:40.064
I'll make the same arrangement
as with old man Russell.

21:41.279 --> 21:42.691
These are the accounts.

21:43.323 --> 21:46.195
You'll clear $300 a year
without lifting a finger.

21:47.494 --> 21:49.986
And you'll have a place
to hang your hat, besides.

21:56.628 --> 22:01.291
I've had an offer on this house
for a herd of horses down in Contention.

22:04.761 --> 22:06.137
I'm going to take it.

22:08.014 --> 22:09.924
You knew that when you walked in here.

22:14.396 --> 22:19.272
Tell me, this house that
you're so hot about, it's mine, isn't it?

22:20.193 --> 22:21.688
Yes, it's yours.

22:22.404 --> 22:25.406
And I can sell it, or not sell it. Right?

22:26.199 --> 22:27.860
You can do what you want to.

22:28.868 --> 22:33.496
- Did the will make any provision for you?
- Not a line.

22:34.791 --> 22:37.994
Then I don't have any responsibility
toward you, do I?

22:38.753 --> 22:42.622
- You don't owe me a thing.
- No, the fact is, I don't.

22:44.843 --> 22:47.761
I'm not one to quarrel with the facts,
Mr. Russell.

22:54.644 --> 22:55.687
[Door opens]

22:57.981 --> 23:00.473
- Is anybody in there?
- Just one.

23:01.735 --> 23:04.487
I've got something to say.
I'd just as soon nobody heard.

23:04.571 --> 23:06.363
BRADEN: Why? Something wrong?

23:06.448 --> 23:09.403
Russell is selling the house.
I'm high and dry.

23:10.660 --> 23:14.113
- Sudden, isn't it?
- It's his house, and my luck.

23:14.497 --> 23:16.906
If you're hurting for money,
I can give you some.

23:17.459 --> 23:20.128
- You can let me have more than that.
- Like what?

23:20.211 --> 23:22.501
You could make an honest woman of me.

23:23.006 --> 23:25.083
Jessie, you're already that.

23:25.508 --> 23:28.178
I need an answer, and you appear to be it.

23:28.261 --> 23:32.841
- That's romantic!
- You could do a whole lot worse.

23:33.975 --> 23:36.811
I don't turn your pants pockets inside out.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.310
I don't say, "No,"
in the middle of the night.

23:40.023 --> 23:43.310
When your stomach aches,
I get you the bicarbonate.

23:43.610 --> 23:46.149
When you catch cold,
I bring you a croup kettle.

23:47.072 --> 23:49.943
I know I'm not 20,
but that's not too bad, either.

23:50.867 --> 23:54.035
<i>Over the years</i>
<i>I have learned how to control my temper.</i>

23:54.287 --> 23:55.617
All that's true.

23:56.331 --> 23:58.371
So? Yes or no?

24:02.921 --> 24:04.084
Not a chance.

24:08.218 --> 24:13.296
I've gone this far, so if it's not
too undignified to ask, why not?

24:15.392 --> 24:18.263
You could be the Queen of Sheba
with a rose in your teeth.

24:18.603 --> 24:22.649
Or velvet-skinned Annie out of a Frisco
hook shop and I'd still say, "No."

24:24.234 --> 24:26.773
You've got me in classy company, anyhow.

24:27.028 --> 24:31.027
I started working when I was 10, Jessie,
cleaning spittoons at a dime a day.

24:31.241 --> 24:35.370
Thirty years later, all I see out there
is a dirt road going nowhere.

24:35.787 --> 24:39.833
<i>The only thing that changes the view</i>
<i>is a dog lifting his leg by that wall.</i>

24:41.293 --> 24:43.749
Saturday nights, I haul in the town drunks.

24:44.254 --> 24:49.083
They get their 25-cent dinners and
their rotgut all over my one good shirt.

24:49.676 --> 24:52.382
I wear 3 pounds of iron strapped to my leg.

24:52.470 --> 24:56.172
That makes me fair game for any
cowboy who's had one too many.

24:56.933 --> 25:01.395
No, Jessie, I don't need a wife.
I need out.

25:03.690 --> 25:05.684
Doesn't seem to be my day, does it?

25:07.068 --> 25:08.398
I'm doing you a favor.

25:12.157 --> 25:16.820
Any time a man weasels out on you,
turns out he's doing you a favor.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.573
Well, maybe you are, Frank.

25:44.898 --> 25:47.188
- Are you in charge here?
- Henry Mendez.

25:47.817 --> 25:52.315
My husband and I must get to Bisbee
urgently. We want to leave tonight.

25:52.447 --> 25:54.239
- The line is closed.
- I know.

25:54.324 --> 25:56.993
- I'm prepared to hire a rig.
- We don't have any.

25:57.077 --> 25:59.569
AUDRA: What do you have?
MENDEZ: Nothing at all.

25:59.704 --> 26:01.116
We have a mudwagon.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.908
- Who will drive it?
- I could.

26:06.836 --> 26:09.791
He hasn't enough experience.
The company will not allow it.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.918
I'm willing to let him drive.

26:12.509 --> 26:16.638
- You might sue us if something happens.
- If I bought the wagon?

26:16.972 --> 26:20.591
- It's not mine to sell.
- If I paid for more than our fares?

26:23.311 --> 26:25.981
Well, you'd need a driver and horses.

26:26.564 --> 26:27.645
Four, maybe six horses.

26:27.732 --> 26:29.975
And the relay stations
are not working anymore.

26:30.193 --> 26:32.234
The same horses would go all the way.

26:32.612 --> 26:34.273
Who'll pay if they don't make it?

26:34.364 --> 26:37.983
I'll buy the horses.
So, there's no other problem, is there?

26:39.369 --> 26:42.324
- You want to get there pretty bad.
- Settle it.

26:42.831 --> 26:44.789
We'll go to the hotel and have dinner.

26:44.874 --> 26:47.711
That should give you time
to find the man and get ready.

26:49.045 --> 26:52.296
- I don't know, lady.
- You'll earn a month's wages in three days.

26:52.549 --> 26:54.009
You'll be ready.

27:04.936 --> 27:08.187
Me and Doris want to get out of here, too.
So does Jess.

27:08.273 --> 27:09.733
That's three more of us.

27:10.900 --> 27:15.610
- Russell's looking for a ride, too.
- That's four. Why can't we do it?

27:16.197 --> 27:17.278
Did I say we couldn't?

27:37.218 --> 27:39.461
BILLY: Everybody ready?
SOLDIER: I saw Mendez.

27:39.554 --> 27:42.473
I'm going with you to Bisbee
to get married.

27:42.557 --> 27:45.559
- What do you think of that?
- Not much, but that's up to you.

27:45.644 --> 27:49.014
Here's your ticket.
Show it when we stop for meals.

27:49.105 --> 27:52.226
Drinks are extra. And you hand it in
at your destination.

27:53.068 --> 27:54.110
Hey.

27:54.653 --> 27:56.112
This one is for him.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.439
- Would you hand it to him?
- Sure.

28:04.621 --> 28:08.121
SOLDIER: I see you're going to Contention.
I change there for Bisbee.

28:08.291 --> 28:11.377
Yesterday, I was in the Army.
Next week, I'll be a mining man.

28:11.461 --> 28:14.831
By the week after, I'll have a wife,
all arranged for and waiting.

28:15.256 --> 28:18.258
- Isn't that something?
- Yes, it is.

28:18.468 --> 28:20.627
Where's my houseplant? I don't see it.

28:21.179 --> 28:23.054
I stuck it in the boot. It's okay.

28:23.723 --> 28:27.224
It better be.
I've nursed that thing along for six years.

28:27.519 --> 28:28.979
[Door bursts open]

28:46.621 --> 28:49.623

- Yes, sir.

Write it down for the coach out front.

28:53.670 --> 28:57.372
BILLY: It's a special run.
GRIMES: That's why I'm going on it.

28:58.049 --> 29:02.048
- I'm afraid it's full up.
- You can get one more on, up top.

29:02.595 --> 29:05.930
No one is allowed to ride with the driver.
It's the company rule.

29:10.145 --> 29:13.266
GRIMES: They going?
BILLY: Yes, both of them.

29:25.035 --> 29:27.871
You got a ticket for that stage out front?

29:31.249 --> 29:32.448
Well, that's it.

29:33.168 --> 29:35.790
Give me your ticket,
and you can take the next stage.

29:38.048 --> 29:42.343
- That's a funny idea.
- No, not a funny idea, it's a good idea.

29:43.219 --> 29:47.384
You could stay here, get drunk,
have some fun. How's that sound?

29:48.558 --> 29:51.477
- But I'll be traveling tonight.
- No, I don't think so.

29:51.645 --> 29:54.647
Leave him alone.
You came late, find your own way.

29:58.443 --> 30:01.279
- What did you say?
- I said, "Leave him alone."

30:01.655 --> 30:03.695
Let him take this stage if he wants to.

30:10.914 --> 30:14.117
Suppose I take your ticket, instead.

30:14.584 --> 30:18.037
- You just walk in and take someone's seat?
- Looks like it.

30:20.090 --> 30:22.416
Somebody's pulling a joke on somebody.

30:23.510 --> 30:24.886
You think so?

30:33.103 --> 30:36.971
What kind of a business do you run?
You let a man walk in and take your seat?

30:37.065 --> 30:40.233
After paying the fare and all?
And the company does nothing?

30:40.318 --> 30:41.361
Friend.

30:44.614 --> 30:47.367
This business is between you and me...

30:48.034 --> 30:51.700
and we don't want anybody else
poking their nose in, do we?

30:52.998 --> 30:54.659
You wearing a gun?

30:58.128 --> 30:59.504
You better get one.

31:00.797 --> 31:04.630
You can't threaten a man.
There are witnesses here.

31:04.968 --> 31:09.049
- They heard you call me a dirty name.
<i>- I didn't call you anything.</i>

31:09.556 --> 31:12.724
And even if they didn't, I did.

31:15.103 --> 31:16.978
I didn't say a word.

31:24.154 --> 31:25.196
Now, friend...

31:26.323 --> 31:28.815
I'm going to step out into the street...

31:29.409 --> 31:31.699
and if you don't come out
in one minute...

31:33.079 --> 31:35.120
I will have to come back in here.

JESSIE: You should have done something.

- Yes, to you.

32:20.669 --> 32:22.164
It wasn't my business.

- What if he'd taken your ticket?
- He didn't.

32:24.839 --> 32:28.790
- That soldier would have helped you.
- I didn't ask him for help.

32:30.595 --> 32:32.589
He didn't even have a gun.

32:33.431 --> 32:35.888
That's his business if
he doesn't carry one.

32:38.728 --> 32:41.600
It takes a lot to light a fire under you,
doesn't it?

32:42.607 --> 32:45.728
If it's all right with you,
I didn't feel like bleeding for him.

Don't alarm yourself, young lady.

The wild, free ones are in the mountains.
The wild, caught ones are at San Carlos.

33:36.953 --> 33:40.039
I've heard about what the Indians do
to white women.

33:40.957 --> 33:44.576
They do to white women
what they do to Indian women.

33:44.794 --> 33:47.749
And they don't mind it much, red or white.

33:48.673 --> 33:51.296
The ladies don't enjoy such talk.

33:51.635 --> 33:55.301
- What talk?
- About what Apaches do to women.

- You saying I got a loose mouth?
- If he wasn't saying it, I am.

Right! That lady speaks right up,
don't you?

My tongue is my only weapon, Mr. Grimes.

34:14.616 --> 34:15.897

Have you ever been hungry, lady?

34:50.860 --> 34:55.190
Not just ready for supper.
Hungry enough so that your belly swells?

34:56.074 --> 34:59.111
No matter how hungry I was,
I wouldn't eat one of those dogs.

35:00.036 --> 35:02.160
You'd eat it, and fight for the bones.

35:03.957 --> 35:07.956
- Have you ever eaten a dog, Mr. Russell?
- Eaten one and lived like one.

35:09.963 --> 35:11.006
Dear me.

35:16.886 --> 35:20.932
Mr. Russell obviously feels sympathy
for the Indians' plight.

If you're a humane man, you do.

The natural distrust and resentment
of the Indians.

- Their reluctance to cultivate the soil.
- They live where they don't want to live.

That, too, which can't be helped
for the time being.

We all agreed. You were asleep.

44:00.785 --> 44:04.321
I thought, if he's so anxious to go,
he won't mind.

44:07.167 --> 44:09.623
- Where's it go?
- Same place.

44:10.170 --> 44:14.085
We'll be in Benson tomorrow, if the
road is all right and nothing happens.

<i>about you.</i>

45:57.277 --> 45:59.317
You could have cleared your throat.

46:00.572 --> 46:02.316
I couldn't. My heart was in it.

46:03.450 --> 46:05.942
It's hot. These are heavy.

46:07.996 --> 46:11.911
So, you've seen my legs.
Well, there are worse walking around.

46:12.626 --> 46:14.666
Some worse, some better.

46:15.754 --> 46:19.005
You won't have much to do with them,
so don't worry.

46:20.091 --> 46:21.800

46:22.135 --> 46:24.923
<i>Has anyone ever gotten</i>
<i>within range of you?</i>

46:25.930 --> 46:29.550
Not that it's any of your business,
but I was married once.

46:31.061 --> 46:33.350
I've been a widow since I was 19.

46:34.856 --> 46:37.265
My husband was a sweet Missouri boy.

46:38.485 --> 46:41.403
One night,
he was brought home on a kitchen door.

46:41.738 --> 46:43.732
He'd been shot eight times.

46:44.324 --> 46:47.492
There had been an argument
over the price of a Mexican saddle.

46:49.245 --> 46:52.117
He had a comic valentine for me
in his pocket.

46:53.625 --> 46:55.784
The dead are dead. You should bury them.

46:58.046 --> 46:59.755
I'm sure that's good advice.

47:01.758 --> 47:03.799
The trouble is, Mr. Russell...

47:04.678 --> 47:08.012
I think you feel the same way
about the living.

47:28.201 --> 47:29.696
What do you want?

47:30.036 --> 47:33.952
I hope I'm not bothering you,
but it's so hot, I was just cooking.

There's a nice breeze up here, isn't there?

47:42.173 --> 47:43.799
Everybody's gone to sleep.

47:43.883 --> 47:47.218
I can't sleep when it gets this hot.
I just wake up dizzy.

47:47.762 --> 47:49.222
Is that a fact?

47:53.143 --> 47:57.438
This place sure is spooky.
All those buildings and nobody in them.

48:01.943 --> 48:03.771
I'm glad you're along with us.

48:05.030 --> 48:06.072
If anything happened...

48:06.114 --> 48:09.401
it's nice to know there's someone
who could do something.

48:10.327 --> 48:11.369
That's what you think.

48:12.746 --> 48:16.412
I saw you at the station,
and you frightened everyone there.

48:17.208 --> 48:18.917
Did you like that, little lady?

48:20.086 --> 48:22.329
I like to see a man act like a man.

Why? So he can get his head blown off?

49:04.422 --> 49:07.792
Let go of me! He's got to do something!
That man hurt me!

49:09.052 --> 49:12.054
You wagged your tail in his face,
and you got his attention.

49:14.808 --> 49:18.593
You're disgusting, you know that?
You talk so dirty.

- It's cooling.
- Thank you.

- What's a bottle like this cost?
- The best years of your life.

50:51.196 --> 50:54.233
I like Dr. Favor. He has lovely manners.

50:54.532 --> 50:58.116
I noticed his hands.
He keeps his nails so clean.

50:58.286 --> 51:00.956
He is proud of his hands and feet.
They're so small.

51:01.373 --> 51:04.410
But I am proud of his brain.
It's very large.

51:05.001 --> 51:08.952
- He reads a lot?
- Far into the night, which is just as well.

51:09.255 --> 51:13.124
Because when he removes his trousers
and folds them neatly...

51:13.259 --> 51:15.419
and hangs them over a chair...

51:15.887 --> 51:19.257
that sharp, exciting intelligence of his
doesn't count for much.

51:20.100 --> 51:23.766
<i>Because you see all we're left with</i>
<i>are his thin, spindly legs...</i>

51:23.895 --> 51:25.723

- And all the knots and bumps.
- A love match, huh?

51:32.028 --> 51:35.612
When I was 18, and his student,
and I heard him read Robert Browning.

51:36.741 --> 51:40.407
But now I'm 35,
and I hear him cough up phlegm.

51:41.162 --> 51:45.541
They all make those noises.
Bathroom noises and bedroom noises.

- A shotgun.

- He's helped enough without giving a tally.
- About $12,000, I figure.

- Just about.
- Get it loaded.

I flatter myself
that I understand Mr. Russell.

01:03:49.502 --> 01:03:53.370
We affronted his dignity,
and a man needs his dignity.

01:03:54.423 --> 01:03:59.585
We asked him not to ride with us.
Now he says we can't walk with him.

01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:04.717
Maybe we don't walk the way you walk.
That's fair, but harsh.

01:04:05.726 --> 01:04:10.021
- But you're no longer in a hurry, are you?
- No, I'm not.

01:04:11.482 --> 01:04:14.318
You may go on,
but without the saddlebags and the gun.

01:04:15.611 --> 01:04:20.108

You starved Indians to death
at San Carlos for that money.

- If they catch you, they'll kill you.
- They didn't hurt us before. Why now?

They'll run out of water.
Will you give them yours?

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.610
- No.
- Then they'll kill you for it.

You have no say in this.

You can either go on or stay...

01:05:12.793 --> 01:05:15.629

the same way I came up it.

01:32:04.738 --> 01:32:08.737
Do you hear me now? You just hold on.
Just you hold on there, hold on.

01:32:21.922 --> 01:32:22.965

01:32:47.531 --> 01:32:49.691
Cicero Grimes, meet John Russell.

01:33:17.686 --> 01:33:19.098
BILLY: Where's he going?

01:33:19.814 --> 01:33:22.140
RUSSELL: Up behind us,
to close the back door.

01:33:24.193 --> 01:33:25.902
Then, how do we get out?

01:33:38.415 --> 01:33:40.493
[Suspenseful instrumental music]

01:34:24.795 --> 01:34:26.338
BANDIT: Hey, <i>hombre</i>!

01:34:28.591 --> 01:34:30.383
<i>How'd you like that woman?</i>

01:34:31.802 --> 01:34:35.504
If you want that woman, <i>hombre,</i>
you'd better hurry...

01:34:36.974 --> 01:34:40.474
<i>or maybe there will be nothing</i>
<i>left in the sun!</i>

01:34:47.818 --> 01:34:48.861
AUDRA: Alex.

01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:52.573
Please...

01:34:54.909 --> 01:34:56.072
help me!

01:34:59.163 --> 01:35:00.788
Alex! Help me!

01:35:02.708 --> 01:35:03.751
Alex!

01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:06.326
Alex!

01:35:13.636 --> 01:35:16.341
[Audra's cries for help continue]

01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:43.955
We have to give them that money.
I think you know that.

01:35:45.251 --> 01:35:47.458
Like you had to give him water?

01:35:47.586 --> 01:35:49.995
- People help each other.
- And kill each other.

01:35:50.089 --> 01:35:52.415
- I've seen that.
- You'll see some more.

01:35:54.677 --> 01:35:58.260
If you want to say it's my fault
we're stuck up here, go ahead.

01:35:59.139 --> 01:36:01.429
All I want to know is why you helped.

01:36:02.518 --> 01:36:06.469
Because he needed it,
just like that woman needs it.

01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:11.768
It's not up to us to decide
whether she deserves to live or not.

01:36:12.528 --> 01:36:13.940
We only help, huh?

01:36:15.489 --> 01:36:17.779
- Do we have another choice?
- Not help.

01:36:19.869 --> 01:36:21.245
Just let her die?

01:36:22.079 --> 01:36:23.658
That's up to Grimes.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.871
You mean you'd sacrifice her life
for that money?

01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:34.877
You go down there and you ask that lady
what she thinks of life.

01:36:35.843 --> 01:36:40.007
Or what it's worth to the Indians
at San Carlos when they run out of meat.

01:36:40.347 --> 01:36:42.839
She didn't take the money. Favor did.

01:36:43.184 --> 01:36:45.592
She said, "Those dirty Indians eat dog."

01:36:46.187 --> 01:36:50.731
But she could never eat dog,
no matter what. Ask her if she will now.

01:36:51.525 --> 01:36:54.064
I don't know what your gripe is
against the world.

01:36:54.862 --> 01:36:57.354
JESSIE: Maybe you got a real one.
RUSSELL: Lady.

01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:02.238
Up in those mountains there's
a whole people who have lost everything.

01:37:03.037 --> 01:37:05.908
They have no place left
to spread their blankets.

01:37:05.998 --> 01:37:11.290
<i>They've been insulted, diseased,</i>
<i>made drunk and foolish.</i>

01:37:12.046 --> 01:37:15.083
You call the men who did that Christians,
and you trust them.

01:37:15.174 --> 01:37:17.500
I know them as white men, and I don't.

01:37:18.219 --> 01:37:19.261
Russell.

01:37:20.179 --> 01:37:23.382
If nobody ever lifted a finger
until people were deserving...

01:37:23.474 --> 01:37:25.467
the world would go to hell.

01:37:26.352 --> 01:37:30.018
We better deal with each other
out of need and forget merit...

01:37:30.272 --> 01:37:33.725
because none of us have too much
of that. Not me, you, or anybody.

01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:37.400
If it bothers you, why talk about it?

01:37:47.164 --> 01:37:48.410
BANDIT: [Shouts] You hear me?

01:37:50.084 --> 01:37:53.703
Come on down here.
I got something for you!

01:37:55.881 --> 01:37:58.551
<i>Hey,</i> hombre, <i>whatever your name is.</i>

01:38:01.053 --> 01:38:02.513
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:38:05.724 --> 01:38:08.430
[Audra's cries for help intensify]

01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:17.186
Alex! Please help me!

01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:26.192
God sees this.

01:38:27.872 --> 01:38:30.827
And if we live we must live in fear of him.

01:38:33.502 --> 01:38:36.041
That's what they frightened me with
as a child.

01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:40.460
Don't be frightened, Mr. Mendez.
There is no God.

01:38:41.802 --> 01:38:43.760
Not in either of us, perhaps.

01:38:43.846 --> 01:38:45.092
Not anywhere.

01:38:45.472 --> 01:38:47.098
Nothing, Dr. Favor?

01:38:48.017 --> 01:38:49.097
Nothing.

01:38:49.226 --> 01:38:52.264
You're sure? No reward in Heaven?

01:38:53.606 --> 01:38:55.149
FAVOR: Why lie to ourselves?

01:38:55.232 --> 01:38:58.519
Hell? A little bit of Hell, maybe?

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.362
Oh, yes.

01:39:01.989 --> 01:39:03.401
There is Hell.

01:39:09.371 --> 01:39:11.946
[Audra's cries continue]

01:39:47.284 --> 01:39:48.993
DORIS: By dark, she'll be dead.

01:39:51.705 --> 01:39:54.032
DORIS: Isn't somebody
going to do something?

01:40:04.844 --> 01:40:08.296
RUSSELL: All right. If somebody wants
to go down there, go ahead.

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.888
Just one thing: You walk down there
and you won't walk back.

01:40:14.937 --> 01:40:18.058
Leave the bags, start up with the woman,
they'll kill you both.

01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:21.601
You're saying that
so nobody will take the money and try it.

01:40:22.528 --> 01:40:25.281
I'm saying it
because they'll kill both of you.

01:40:27.616 --> 01:40:30.903
It's your wife down there.
Are you going to cut her loose?

01:40:34.165 --> 01:40:36.324
Mendez, are you going to save her?

01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:46.508
Billy Lee, what's your last name?

01:40:47.094 --> 01:40:49.135
Are you going to go down there?

01:40:49.805 --> 01:40:52.475
This one won't.
It's his woman, but he won't do it.

01:40:52.808 --> 01:40:56.474
He doesn't care enough about her,
but maybe somebody else does.

01:41:00.065 --> 01:41:01.609
All right. You, lady.

01:41:02.526 --> 01:41:06.525
<i>You worry about his wife</i>
<i>more than he does. Go on down there.</i>

01:41:06.864 --> 01:41:09.570
<i>Cut her loose,</i>
<i>then get shot in the back or the front...</i>

01:41:09.658 --> 01:41:11.652
if the Mexican by the trough does it.

01:41:12.453 --> 01:41:15.371
In the back or in the front,
one way or the other.

01:41:30.471 --> 01:41:33.473
Just give me your knife.
That's all I want from you.

01:41:37.311 --> 01:41:39.933
You want a lot more than that
from me, lady.

01:42:20.604 --> 01:42:22.230
Come here, kid.

01:42:30.781 --> 01:42:34.614
I'm not looking to get myself killed.
Do you know how to use this?

01:42:36.328 --> 01:42:37.492
BILLY: I guess so.

01:42:37.621 --> 01:42:42.284
Ejects and loads. It's ready now.
I hope you only need the one.

01:42:45.004 --> 01:42:46.463
RUSSELL: Watch the Mexican.

01:42:51.135 --> 01:42:54.053
After I go past him,
he'll come out with his back to you.

01:42:54.138 --> 01:42:56.464
If he touches his gun, you shoot him.

01:42:56.765 --> 01:42:57.929
In the back?

01:42:58.184 --> 01:43:00.094
I'll ask him to turn around.

01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:04.523
- And something else: the money.
- What about it?

01:43:05.024 --> 01:43:07.860
You may have to
take it to San Carlos after.

01:43:09.028 --> 01:43:10.689
That's easy enough.

01:43:18.996 --> 01:43:21.037
I thought you took it for yourself.

01:43:21.123 --> 01:43:23.829
You can think what you want,
that's up to you.

01:43:24.502 --> 01:43:26.127
All of us thought so.

01:43:26.337 --> 01:43:31.580
It belongs to those Indians.
I grew up and hunted on their land.

01:43:32.218 --> 01:43:34.970
So, maybe you take the money back.
I owe it.

01:43:39.558 --> 01:43:41.386
I'll see that it gets back.

01:43:41.811 --> 01:43:45.596
Tell them to cut you a plain, $10-horse
by way of thanks.

01:43:54.698 --> 01:43:56.858
All that trouble you went to, huh?

01:43:58.577 --> 01:44:00.986
It's a shock to grow old, Mr. Russell.

01:44:12.341 --> 01:44:13.884
RUSSELL: [Shouts] Hey!

01:44:15.427 --> 01:44:17.136
<i>I got something for you.</i>

01:46:07.122 --> 01:46:12.284
GRIMES: You got a lot of hard bark on you,
walking down here like this.

01:46:31.856 --> 01:46:35.771
Now, I owe you. You put two holes in me.

01:46:36.569 --> 01:46:38.609
That's usually enough for most.

01:46:38.696 --> 01:46:43.323
GRIMES: Don't try it again.
That vaquero is more than a fair hand.

01:46:44.869 --> 01:46:46.328
You got the money?

01:46:46.745 --> 01:46:49.451
I guess I brought my dirty laundry
by mistake.

01:46:49.665 --> 01:46:50.947
Let me see it.

01:46:51.167 --> 01:46:52.828
Look for yourself.

01:47:00.885 --> 01:47:02.344
Come on, hurry up.

Please, get out of the way!

01:47:29.163 --> 01:47:30.872
Well, now.

01:47:33.459 --> 01:47:36.212
What do you suppose
Hell's going to look like?

01:47:37.463 --> 01:47:39.919
We all die. It's just a question of when.

01:48:38.566 --> 01:48:39.812
Mr. Mendez!

01:48:40.192 --> 01:48:41.901
BILLY: This one is still alive.

01:49:11.056 --> 01:49:15.269
I would like, at least, to know his name.

01:49:18.647 --> 01:49:20.475
He was called John Russell.
