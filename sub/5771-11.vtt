CHRISTMASTIME
IN NEW YORK CITY--

00:04.305 --> 00:06.707
SNOW ON THE GROUND,
LIGHTS IN THE TREES,

00:06.740 --> 00:08.542
AND SO MANY TOURISTS
THAT IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

00:08.576 --> 00:10.711
TO RETURN A BRA
TO A DEPARTMENT STORE.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.246
IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR
WHEN--

00:12.280 --> 00:14.748
ARE YOU BUYING A TREE
OR NOT?
I AM.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.584
I'LL TAKE
YOUR BIGGEST TREE.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.320
$250.
WHAT?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.489
FOR A DEAD TREE?

00:21.522 --> 00:24.358
OKAY, I'LL TAKE
THAT LITTLE SICKLY ONE.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.195
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.263
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
AND I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP

00:29.297 --> 00:30.364
BRINGING IT
TO MY OFFICE.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.765
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU DO,

00:31.799 --> 00:33.767
OR IS IT, LIKE,
ONE OF YOUR CHRISTMAS ELVES?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.403
[both chuckle]

00:35.436 --> 00:36.570
ALL RIGHT.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.306
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
THANK YOU.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.608
(woman)
* SOON GONNA JINGLE

00:40.641 --> 00:42.343
* THE BELLS THAT'LL JINGLE
TAXI! TAXI!

00:42.376 --> 00:43.744
* ALL YOUR TROUBLES AWAY
[shouts]

00:43.777 --> 00:45.146
* EVERYBODY'S WAITING

00:45.179 --> 00:47.081
* FOR THE MAN WITH THE BAG
DAMN IT!

00:47.115 --> 00:48.082
[subway doors chime]

00:48.116 --> 00:50.184
EXCUSE ME!
HOLD THE TRAIN.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.352
THANK YOU.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.653
* HE'S GOT A SLEIGH FULL

00:52.686 --> 00:55.123
* IT'S NOT GO--
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.726
HOW HINDU ARE YOU?
IT'S A CHRISTMAS TREE.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.628
I DON'T THINK SO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.196
WHAT WERE YOU HOLDING?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.364
[overlapping comments]

01:03.397 --> 01:04.432
SON OF A BITCH.
(Danny)
MINDY, MINDY.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.468
MINDY, NO.
(Morgan)
DR. L. AAGH!

01:07.501 --> 01:10.304
PUT THE TREE BACK!
(Morgan)
JUST LIKE THE GRINCH!

01:10.338 --> 01:14.342
[chatter continues
in background]

01:14.375 --> 01:15.609
NO!
OH!

01:15.643 --> 01:17.511
(Morgan)
COME ON, DR. L!

01:17.545 --> 01:19.513
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

01:19.547 --> 01:22.516
[upbeat music]

01:22.550 --> 01:24.485

01:24.518 --> 01:25.819
(Betsy)
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.221
DR, REED?

01:27.255 --> 01:29.623
DR. REED. OH!

01:29.657 --> 01:32.560
EVERYONE, DR. REED
IS THIN AND HANDSOME AGAIN.

01:32.593 --> 01:36.264
OKAY, CALM DOWN.
WHOA.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.566
SOMEONE'S LOOKING GOOD ENOUGH
TO GET ROOFIED.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.301
YOUR BODY LOOKS AMAZING.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.602
AREN'T YOU GLAD
I MADE YOU GO TO FAT CAMP?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.237
IT WASN'T A FAT CAMP.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.739
IT WAS THE CENTER,
AN HOLISTIC WEIGHT LOSS CLINIC

01:45.773 --> 01:47.608
WHERE I LEARNED
I'D BEEN ADDICTED TO FOOD.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.311
DR. REED, YOUR SECRET SANTA
LEFT THIS FOR YOU.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.512
THANK YOU.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.747
OH, MY GOD.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.749
OH, IT'S THE TOFFEE
FROM WHERE I GREW UP AS A KID.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.351
YOU CAN'T EVEN BUY THIS
IN AMERICA.

01:57.385 --> 02:00.388
IT'S TOO FULL OF FAT
AND SUGAR.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.922
THANK YOU,
WHOEVER BOUGHT ME THIS.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.224
IT'S A NICE GIFT.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.625
GOOD-BYE, TOFFEE.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.728
I LOVE WHEN YOU SPEND
THE NIGHT AT HEATHER'S.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.431
IT MEANS THAT I GET
A MORNING COMMUTE BUDDY.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.766
I USED TO THINK THAT THIS
OTHER GUY WAS MY COMMUTE BUDDY,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.169
BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT HE JUST
LIVED ON THE SUBWAY.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.370
AND I DIDN'T FIND OUT--

02:16.404 --> 02:17.238
CLIFF.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.406
HEY, CLIFF, CLIFF.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.573
MY STORY,
DID YOU HEAR IT?

02:19.607 --> 02:20.874
YEAH, SORRY.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.876
I WAS UP
TILL 3:00 A.M. LAST NIGHT.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.212
WHY WERE YOU UP?

02:24.245 --> 02:26.180
HEATHER AND I GOT
IN A HUGE FIGHT.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.482
YOU DID?
MM-HMM.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.751
NOT YOU AND HEATHER!

02:30.784 --> 02:33.521
YOU GUYS ARE ONE OF THE GREAT
COUPLES OF ALL TIME.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.390
WELL, LATELY, EVERYTHING I DO
MAKES HER MAD--

02:36.424 --> 02:37.691
HOW I TALK...
WHAT?

02:37.725 --> 02:39.227
THE WAY I ORGANIZE
MY SWEATERS.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.228
IN ROY G. BIV COLOR ORDER.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.695
IT'S OCD, BUT...

02:41.729 --> 02:44.865
I SWEAR THAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE
CONCERT TICKETS THIS MONTH

02:44.898 --> 02:46.300
WE'D BREAK UP.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.701
EXCITING NEWS, EVERYBODY.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.237
THIS FRIDAY,
SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES

02:49.270 --> 02:52.706
IS HAVING A CHRISTMAS PARTY
FOR THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.642
THE ENTIRE BUILDING?
YEAH.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
THIS BUILDING
IS FULL OF RANDOS

02:56.344 --> 02:57.378
WHO WE SHOULD GET
TO KNOW BETTER.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.879
THE NOTARY PUBLIC
ON FIVE,

02:58.912 --> 03:01.415
MAYBE THOSE COOL LAWYERS
ACROSS THE HALLWAY.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.817
OKAY, IS THIS A PLOY
SO YOU CAN HANG OUT WITH CLIFF?

03:03.851 --> 03:04.885
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.754
ARE YOU HAVING A STROKE?
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

03:06.787 --> 03:09.657
OH, AND WE CAN EXCHANGE
OUR FINAL SECRET SANTA GIFTS.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.293
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.
I'M YOUR SECRET SANTA.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.362
MEDICAL GAUZE?
COME ON.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.397
YEAH, I DON'T BELIEVE IN
SPENDING MONEY ON STUPID THINGS.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.500
REALLY? SO I ASSUME
YOU GOT THAT SHIRT FOR FREE?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.934
BAZINGA!
WHAT?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.736
AND WITH THAT CLASSIC DANNY DIG,
IT'S SETTLED.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.305
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PARTY.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.673
YOU AND I HAVE TO
GO GET FOOD.
OKAY.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.841
I THINK THE PARTY
SHOULD BE GLUTEN-FREE.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.243
WHAT? NO. WHY?

03:29.277 --> 03:31.412
'CAUSE TAMRA HAS
CELIAC'S DISEASE.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.013
YEAH, WHEN MY STOMACH
SEES GLUTEN,

03:33.046 --> 03:34.648
IT'S LIKE,
"THIS AIN'T YOUR PARTY,"

03:34.682 --> 03:36.350
BUT HOW'D YOU KNOW?

03:36.384 --> 03:37.951
I LOG WHAT YOU EAT.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.020
I NOTICE WHAT YOU EAT.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.755
OKAY, FINE, WHATEVER,
IT CAN BE GLUTEN-FREE.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.257
PETER, JEREMY, I NEED YOU GUYS

03:43.291 --> 03:44.792
TO GO PICK UP CLASSY ALCOHOL.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.360
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK
FOR ME.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.695
IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION

03:47.728 --> 03:49.330
THAT, DURING SPECIAL EVENTS
IN MY LIFE,

03:49.363 --> 03:52.366
I MAYBE PARTAKE
IN ALCOHOL A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.902
AND, AS YOU KNOW,
LAST YEAR AT A HOLIDAY PARTY,

03:54.935 --> 03:56.504
I MADE SEX
TO A CHRISTMAS TREE.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.439
WELL, WE'LL MISS YOU,
BUT IT'S PROBABLY

03:58.472 --> 04:01.475
FOR THE BEST, AND ULTIMATELY
WE WON'T NOTICE YOUR ABSENCE.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.577
SO, BETSY, I NEED YOU
TO GET 4,000 WINE COOLERS.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.280
YOU WON'T NOTICE MY ABSENCE
BECAUSE I'LL BE THERE.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.316
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU GUYS
WOULD RESPECT MY WISHES

04:08.349 --> 04:10.050
AND MAYBE KEEP IT
A DRY PARTY.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.353
EX-QUEEZE ME?
THAT'S VERY MATURE OF YOU,
PETER.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.721
NO, JUST BECAUSE--

04:13.754 --> 04:14.955
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING--
SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES

04:14.988 --> 04:16.056
ARE HOSTING A CHRISTMAS PARTY

04:16.089 --> 04:18.492
FREE OF GLUTEN
AND ALCOHOL.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.394
AND I HAVE
A DEADLY ALLERGY TO--

04:20.428 --> 04:22.396
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR ANY MORE
RESTRICTIONS FOR THE PARTY.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.196
(Peter)
OKAY, WHY DOES THIS BUILDING

04:23.230 --> 04:25.065
HAVE SO MANY TAXIDERMISTS
IN IT?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.667
IT'S GONNA BE
A WEIRD PARTY.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.869
LAST TIME I WAS
AT A HOLIDAY PARTY SOBER

04:28.902 --> 04:31.372
WAS AT MY SIXTH GRADE
SNOWFLAKE PLAY.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.306
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

04:32.340 --> 04:33.974
I HAD TWO BEERS
THAT NIGHT.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.510
THE HOLIDAYS CAN BE TOUGH
FOR US FOOD JUNKIES TOO.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.646
BUT LUCKILY, THEY DID GIVE US
A SECRET WEAPON

04:38.679 --> 04:41.081
AT THE CENTER--
THIS IS A TASTE SPRAY

04:41.114 --> 04:43.351
DESIGNED TO SATISFY
MY CRAVINGS.

04:43.384 --> 04:47.421
SHORT RIB MIST.
YUMMY.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.056
I AM VERY FULL NOW.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.858
OKAY, THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT

04:50.891 --> 04:52.960
THROUGH THIS PARTY
IS IF WE'RE SOBER BUDDIES.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.728
YES.
YOU STOP ME FROM DRINKING...

04:54.762 --> 04:57.398
YOU STOP ME FROM TAKING QUESO
INTO THE BATHROOM.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.732
(both)
DEAL.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.435
SO ARE YOU MAKING
A GINGERBREAD HOUSE THIS YEAR?

05:01.469 --> 05:03.337
NAH,
I GOT A LOT GOING ON.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.873
WORK, AND MY BANK
JUST SENT ME A NEW CREDIT CARD,

05:05.906 --> 05:07.575
SO I HAVE THAT TO ACTIVATE.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.076
YOU ARE SUCH A HORRIBLE LIAR.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.479
I BET YOU ALREADY IMPORTED SUGAR
STAINED GLASS FROM GERMANY.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.381
OH, PLEASE,
GERMAN SUGAR GLASS?

05:13.414 --> 05:16.083
IT'S NOTORIOUSLY BRITTLE
AND CLOUDY.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.353
[softly]
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.621
I AM MAKING A STRUCTURE.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.089
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.591
IT'S THE HOUSE OF A MAN

05:23.624 --> 05:26.093
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO THIS COUNTRY.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.596
JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE'S
CHILDHOOD HOME IN NASHVILLE.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.030
WHAT?

05:31.832 --> 05:32.966
HELLO, MINDY,
DANNY.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.437
HELLO.
HELLO.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.105
HAVE YOU MET MY NEW GIRLFRIEND
MARIA MENOUNOS?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.973
(Danny)
OH, I'M A BIG FAN
OF YOUR JOURNALISM.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.443
YOU'RE MY HAIR IDOL--

05:42.476 --> 05:44.011
ARE YOU TWO DATING?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.078
YEAH.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.114
WH--YOU COULD HAVE
ALMOST ANYBODY.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.683
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
WITH SUCH A SOULFUL PERSON.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.119
AW.
COME HERE, YOU.
[giggling]

05:52.152 --> 05:53.521
THIS IS OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS
TOGETHER,

05:53.554 --> 05:56.056
AND WE'VE JUST BEEN SHARING
AND CELEBRATING.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.592
OH, MY GOSH, MINDY,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

05:58.626 --> 06:00.594
HERE I AM,
FLAUNTING OUR BLOOMING LOVE,

06:00.628 --> 06:02.730
AND YOU WITH YOUR
ENGAGEMENT BREAKUP.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.665
I'M JUST SORRY.
OKAY, LISTEN, PAL,

06:04.698 --> 06:05.833
SHE'S FINE, OKAY?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.435
SHE'S BEEN GOING OUT
WITH A LOT OF GUYS

06:07.468 --> 06:09.069
SINCE THAT GUY--
PROBABLY TOO MANY GUYS.

06:09.102 --> 06:09.870
SHH, THAT'S NOT--
A LOT.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.439
THE RIGHT AMOUNT.
THE NORMAL AMOUNT.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.474
NOT REALLY.
MARIA--NO, HUSH, HUSH.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.975
IT'S BEEN QUITE A--
THE POINT
IS THAT I'M DOING FANTASTIC.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.109
SHE'S DOING GREAT.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.779
MINDY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHINE IT ON IN FRONT OF ME.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.980
I'M A FRIEND, OKAY?

06:20.013 --> 06:23.083
HOLIDAYS ARE ALWAYS HARDEST
ON THE LONELY.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.454
SUICIDE RATES
DO GO UP AS WE ALL KNOW.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.055
SORRY.
BYE, MARIA.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.057
I'M ACTUALLY DATING SOMEONE TOO.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.660
HE'S HANDSOME LAWYER
WHO WORKS IN THIS BUILDING.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.961
OH.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.729
WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.164
NO, NO,
IT'S BETTER THAN GREAT.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.567
IT'S GREAT!

06:39.600 --> 06:40.801
WELL, IF HE WORKS
IN THE BUILDING,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.970
I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING HIM
AT THE PARTY.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.672
GREAT.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.507
OKAY, LET'S GO.
WE CAN'T GET OUT.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.776
WE HAVE TO GO BACK UP--
OKAY, FINE.

06:50.778 --> 06:51.979
WHY DID YOU TELL DESLAURIER
YOU WERE DATING

06:52.012 --> 06:53.581
A LAWYER
IN THE BUILDING?

06:53.614 --> 06:54.882
'CAUSE HE WAS RUBBING
MENOUNOS IN MY FACE.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.216
MENOUNOS.
MENOUNOS.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.151
UGH, I HATE HIM.
BESIDES, WHO KNOWS?

06:58.185 --> 07:00.153
MAYBE AT THE PARTY
I WILL BE DATING SOMEONE.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.089
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.124
BUILDING-WIDE
CHRISTMAS PARTY,

07:04.157 --> 07:06.994
ALL THE SEXY MOOD LIGHTING
YOU INSTALLED IN PHLEBOTOMY.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.997
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOFT LIGHTING
IS GOOD FOR URINE SAMPLES TOO.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.500
NO, NO, THIS IS
A CHRISTMAS PARTY SEX TRAP

07:12.533 --> 07:13.601
SO YOU CAN GET TO CLIFF.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.702
IS THAT SO WRONG,
DANNY?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.704
IS IT SO WRONG FOR AN UNMARRIED
23-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

07:16.737 --> 07:18.138
TO THROW A PARTY
SO SHE CAN MEET A MAN?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.940
YOU'RE A LITTLE NUT JOB,
AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.509
THANK YOU FOR SAYING
THAT I'M LITTLE,

07:21.542 --> 07:22.776
AND IT WILL WORK,
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.944
BECAUSE I HAVE

07:23.977 --> 07:25.112
A FOOLPROOF, FOUR-POINT,

07:25.145 --> 07:26.614
MAN-CATCHING PARTY PLAN.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.148
OH, BOY.
WANNA HEAR ABOUT IT?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.750
NOT REALLY, BUT--
YOU'RE GONNA.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.951
I KNOW.
(Mindy)
HERE'S THE PLAN.

07:30.984 --> 07:35.756
STEP ONE: THROW THE GREATEST
PARTY ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.759
WHEN THE GUY GETS THERE,
IGNORE HIM.

07:38.792 --> 07:43.797
INSTEAD, BE TALKING
TO THE COOLEST GUY IN THE ROOM.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.700
STEP TWO:

07:46.734 --> 07:48.569
I DO A SEXY VERSION
OF SANTA BABY.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.504
IT'S BOTH TITILLATING
AND FESTIVE.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.005
[Santa Baby playing]

07:52.039 --> 07:54.041
* SANTA BABY

07:54.074 --> 07:57.711
* JUST SLIP A SABLE
UNDER THE TREE *

07:57.745 --> 07:59.112
* FOR ME

07:59.146 --> 08:00.881
SANTA BABY?
IT'S DISGUSTING.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.683
IT SEXUALIZES SANTA.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.986
STEP THREE:
PRETEND YOU'RE OVERHEATED.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.021
SAY YOU NEED SOME AIR.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.191
MAKE HIM FOLLOW YOU
TO A PRIVATE LOCATION.

08:11.224 --> 08:15.696
STEP FOUR: FINALLY ALONE
IN A ROMANTIC SETTING,

08:15.729 --> 08:18.732
HE AND I SHARE
A PERFECT FIRST KISS.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.934
THAT'S THE STUPIDEST PLAN
I'VE EVER HEARD.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.703
YOU'RE WRONG.
YOU'LL SEE TOMORROW NIGHT

08:22.736 --> 08:24.872
WHEN I'M TONGUING CLIFF
IN THE COURTYARD.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.107
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.146
[soft music plays]

08:33.180 --> 08:34.915
*

08:34.948 --> 08:36.750
AND THIS IS ELIZABETH,
MY OTHER DOG.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.185
YOU WOULD LOVE HER.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.687
AWW!

08:39.720 --> 08:41.755
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DOG.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.857
IT'D TAKE A LOT
OF SAWDUST TO FILL HER UP.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.593
[chuckles]

08:45.626 --> 08:46.526
WAIT, WHAT?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.729
[knocking]
WHAT THE HELL
WAS SO IMPORTANT?

08:48.762 --> 08:49.830
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:49.863 --> 08:50.864
COME HERE.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.932
HELP ME
FILL MY BRA UP WITH WINE.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.934
OKAY,
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.636
OPEN THIS.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.271
I BOUGHT A BRA THAT HOLDS
TWO FULL BOTTLES FULL OF WINE.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.774
I THOUGHT THIS THING WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE SOBER FOR PETER.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.009
PETER DOESN'T HAVE
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.577
MY MAN-CATCHING PLAN
IS NOT GOING TO WORK

09:03.611 --> 09:04.712
WITHOUT SOME BOOZE, DANNY.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.647
PLUS, THERE'S ALSO
AN ADDED BENEFIT.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.948
WHAT'S THAT?
POUR.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.317
POUR. OKAY.
HERE YOU GO.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.155
YOU SHOULD WEAR THAT
EVERY DAY.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.757
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.926
OKAY.
SORRY.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.064
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN
KIND OF A WEIRD YEAR.

09:24.097 --> 09:27.000
HAD SOME LOSSES
IN MY FAMILY.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.368
I HAD TO SELL
A BUNCH OF--

09:28.401 --> 09:32.706
[fairy tale music]

09:32.740 --> 09:33.941
PASS DOWN TO MY KIDS
ONE DAY.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.743
MORGAN, I CAN'T KEEP
TALKING TO YOU.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.077
TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.815
OKAY, STEP ONE
OF THE SEX TRAP.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.117
FIND THE COOLEST GUY
IN THE ROOM.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.291
HEY, YOU.
I'M MINDY.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.827
OH, BIRUK.
IT IS VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.195
GREAT TO MEET YOU.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.366
[laughs]

09:59.399 --> 10:01.702
OH, BIRUK,
YOU'RE TOO MUCH.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.903
I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.806
OH, IT'S YOUR WHOLE...
THING.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.776
[whispers] YES.
MY MAN TRAP IS WORKING.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.678
I WAS ONCE CAUGHT
IN A MAN TRAP.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.745
I KNEW I HAD
TO ESCAPE THE NET

10:11.779 --> 10:14.648
OR ELSE ENDURE THE HORRORS
OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

10:14.682 --> 10:19.820
OKAY, UM...
DO YOU LIVE DOWNTOWN?

10:19.853 --> 10:21.221
YAY, SOBER BUDDY.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.956
NOT DRINKING
AT A PARTY EATS, DOG.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.759
HITTING ON WOMEN--
OUT OF THE EQUATION.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.861
I MEAN, MARIA MENOUNOS
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.998
THE TERM "BLUE-COLLAR"
DRIVES ME INSANE.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.734
THE WOMAN I'D CREATE
HAD I A WEIRD SCIENCE MACHINE.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.135
IF I WAS DRUNK,
I'D GO OVER THERE

10:35.168 --> 10:36.804
AND SNATCH HER AWAY
FROM DESLAURIER.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.839
GO AND DO THAT.
GO TALK TO HER.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.674
COME ON. I'D NEED, LIKE,
SIX OR SEVEN HARD LEMMIES

10:40.708 --> 10:42.743
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING
OVER THERE TO TALK TO HER.

10:42.776 --> 10:43.977
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH MY HANDS

10:44.011 --> 10:45.879
IF I'M NOT HOLDING BEERS?
HUH?

10:45.913 --> 10:47.881
YEAH, PUT THEM DOWN.
IT'S UNPLEASANT.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.851
[door opens]

10:50.884 --> 10:52.886
WAIT A MINUTE. WHOA, WHOA,
CAN YOU KNOCK FIRST, PLEASE?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.688
I'M NOT GONNA KNOCK
TO THE HOT PIPE ROOM.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.890
ALL RIGHT, WHAT STEP
OF THE MAN TRAP ARE YOU ON?

10:56.924 --> 10:58.125
HIT HIM OVER THE HEAD
WITH A ROLLING PIN

10:58.158 --> 10:59.359
AND PULL DOWN HIS PANTS?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.694
HA HA HA, YOU KNOW
I DON'T OWN

11:00.728 --> 11:02.129
ANY COOKING STUFF--
JOKE'S ON YOU.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.865
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I'M ON STEP TWO.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.066
WHOA.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.735
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
OKAY.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.769
LOOK, CLOSE YOUR EYES.
STOP IT.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.804
YOU'LL SEE IT AT THE UNVEILING
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.741
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.
IT'S LOCATED IN VIRGINIA.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.008
MT. RUSHMORE?

11:15.042 --> 11:18.311
THE MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM HAS REALLY LET YOU DOWN.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.814
I'M SORRY.
I'M A GOOD-LOOKING DOCTOR.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.982
I THINK IT DID FINE.
OKAY.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.751
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WISH YOU PUT THIS MUCH EFFORT

11:23.784 --> 11:24.752
INTO YOUR SECRET SANTA
PRESENTS.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.853
OH, YEAH,
THAT REMINDS ME,

11:25.886 --> 11:27.888
I GOT YOU THIS.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.857
I REFUSE
TO ACCEPT THAT GIFT.

11:29.890 --> 11:30.791
I GOT PETER A REPLICA

11:30.824 --> 11:33.026
OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD CAR,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.394
AND I BARELY LIKE HIM.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.495
THAT'S WHAT A SECRET SANTA
DOES.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.964
FINE.
HURRY UP.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.465
THE SEXY ROUTINE IS NEXT.
I GOTTA WORK.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.034
JUST GIVE ME PEACE.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.502
I LOVE THIS.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.504
NOTHING SAYS CHRISTMAS LIKE
A TRADITIONAL NATIVITY SCENE.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.406
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SOME RECENT SCHOLARSHIP

11:46.439 --> 11:49.309
THAT SUGGESTS JESUS
WAS ACTUALLY A BLACK WOMAN.

11:49.342 --> 11:52.212
RIGHT.
I NEED A DRINK.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.113
[mumbles]

11:53.146 --> 11:55.783
HI, HAVE YOU SEEN MINDY

11:55.816 --> 11:57.217

12:04.024 --> 12:05.158
[chuckles]

12:05.192 --> 12:06.226
I'D SAY I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE GUY

12:06.259 --> 12:08.829
WHO WORKS BELOW YOU,
BUT THAT'S ME.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.497
I WORK AT GILBERT, LURIE,

12:10.530 --> 12:13.166
OH, YOU'RE THE LAWYER
FROM THE BUILDING.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.267
YOU'RE MINDY'S NEW BOYFRIEND?

12:14.301 --> 12:15.803
NO.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.404
DIDN'T REALIZE
SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.039
YOU KNOW, I WAS SURPRISED
TO HEAR IT TOO.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.408
SUPPOSE IT WAS A DIFFERENT
LAWYER FROM THE BUILDING.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.211
SHE DOES TEND TO GET AROUND
IN THE WORKPLACE.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.513
OKAY, WELL, THANKS.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.448

12:54.707 --> 12:58.045
I THINK 99.9% OF EVERYONE
IS HERE.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.947
COME ON.
SING YOUR RAUNCHY SONG.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.581

13:01.614 --> 13:04.417
OKAY.
DR. L, YOU'RE LOSING THE ROOM.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.019
THIS IS ANTICLIMACTIC.
YOU GOT FOCUS.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.455
[overlapping chatter]

13:08.488 --> 13:09.823

OKAY.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.237
I GUESS I COULD GIVE IT
A TRY.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.206
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHY DON'T YOU GO

[cheers and applause]
HERE YOU GO.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.497
BRENDAN!
IT WAS AMAZING.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.333
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.071
YOU WERE OFFERING UP
YOUR WOMANHOOD TO SANTA

14:31.104 --> 14:32.339
IN EXCHANGE
FOR MATERIAL GIFTS.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.341
IT WAS JUST A STUPID SONG.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.909
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE IT.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.210
WELL, AS A FEMINIST,
IT OFFENDED ME

14:37.244 --> 14:38.478

14:51.358 --> 14:52.592
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:52.625 --> 14:53.961

15:32.065 --> 15:34.167
MONTICELLO.
THERE YOU ARE.

15:34.201 --> 15:38.972
[slurping]

15:39.006 --> 15:42.442
UGH, STUPID WINE BRA'S
OUT OF WINE.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.045
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT
THE LONG ISLAND ICED PANTIES.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.048
MIN?

15:48.081 --> 15:50.717
* EVERYBODY'S WAITING
FOR THE MAN WITH THE BAG *

15:50.750 --> 15:54.254
* 'CAUSE CHRISTMAS
IS COMING AGAIN *

15:54.287 --> 15:56.156
ARE YOU SAD ABOUT CLIFF?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.291
SAD IS WHEN THE CAB DRIVER
THOUGHT I WAS JADEN SMITH.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.227
I'M HEARTBROKEN.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.094
WELL--WELL, SO WHAT?

16:01.128 --> 16:02.996
THE GUY LEFT.
YOU WEREN'T EVEN DATING.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.097
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

16:04.131 --> 16:05.198
THE BIG DEAL IS THAT I THREW

16:05.232 --> 16:06.733
A PARTY
WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE

16:06.766 --> 16:10.037
OF GETTING A GUY WHO IS STILL
TECHNICALLY IN A RELATIONSHIP

16:10.070 --> 16:12.205
TO KISS ME,
AND THEN HE LEFT.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.207
I'M THE MOST PATHETIC LOSER.

16:14.241 --> 16:18.745
I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT CHEER YOU UP.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.180
FROM YOUR SECRET SANTA.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.282
NO, DANNY, LOOK, YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T WANT

16:22.315 --> 16:23.650
TO SPEND MONEY
ON A SECRET SANTA.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.152
I SHOULDN'T HAVE EXPECTED
A GIFT.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.255
SOMETIMES THE BEST GIFTS
DON'T COST ANYTHING.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.789
I GUESS IF YOU'RE, LIKE,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.359
A POOR MOUSE
IN A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.794
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
(Timbaland)
* IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

16:34.827 --> 16:36.363
WHEN YOU FIRST
STARTED WORKING HERE,

16:36.396 --> 16:37.597
YOU USED TO PLAY THIS NONSTOP.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.467
IT WAS THE FIRST THING ABOUT YOU
THAT EVER REALLY ANNOYED ME.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.668
* STEP TO, STEP TO

16:41.701 --> 16:43.670
* FREAKY, FREAKY,
BABY GIRL *

16:43.703 --> 16:45.072
(Aaliyah)
* WHAT WOULD YOU DO

16:45.105 --> 16:46.339
* TO GET TO ME

16:46.373 --> 16:47.474
* WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

16:47.507 --> 16:49.242
* TO HAVE YOUR WAY

16:49.276 --> 16:50.210
* WOULD YOU GIVE UP

16:50.243 --> 16:51.578
* OR TRY AGAIN

16:51.611 --> 16:52.679
* IF I HESITATED

16:52.712 --> 16:53.813
* TO LET YOU IN

16:53.846 --> 16:55.348
* NOW WOULD YOU BE YOURSELF

16:55.382 --> 16:56.449
* OR PLAY YOUR ROLE

16:56.483 --> 16:59.186
* TELL ALL THE BOYS
OR KEEP IT LOW *

16:59.219 --> 17:00.420
* IF I SAY NO

17:00.453 --> 17:01.721
* WOULD YOU TURN AWAY

17:01.754 --> 17:02.822
* OR PLAY ME OFF

17:02.855 --> 17:04.091
* OR WOULD YOU STAY

17:04.124 --> 17:05.225
* OH, IF AT FIRST

17:05.258 --> 17:06.059
* YOU DON'T SUCCEED

17:06.093 --> 17:07.560
* IF AT FIRST
YOU DON'T SUCCEED *

17:07.594 --> 17:11.264
* THEN DUST YOURSELF OFF
AND TRY AGAIN *

17:11.298 --> 17:13.333
* DUST YOURSELF OFF
AND TRY AGAIN *

17:13.366 --> 17:15.468
* TRY AGAIN
I KNOW IT'S STUPID.

17:15.502 --> 17:20.273
SO ANYWAY I CAN GET YOU A GIFT
CARD OR WRITE A PERSONAL CHECK.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.808
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.710
JUST DON'T TELL MORGAN
OR JEREMY ABOUT IT.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.213
OKAY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.747
I LOVED IT.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.150
YOU LIKED IT?

17:43.396 --> 17:45.532
MINDY, GIVE ME
THAT BOOB WINE.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.367
WHAT?
NO. NO.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.669
DANNY, I'M SORRY.
I'M A MONSTER.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.371
MONTICELLO!

17:51.404 --> 17:53.773
STOP!
DO WE HAVE ANY CINDERBLOCKS?

17:53.806 --> 17:56.509
SOME OF THE GUESTS WANT TO SEE
ME THROW 'EM OFF THE ROOF.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.647
WHOA,
WEIRD ENERGY IN HERE.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.250
IS THE GHOST BACK?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.387
[Peter slurping]

18:07.420 --> 18:08.621
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.323
GIVE ME THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.691
ONE MINUTE I'M NORMAL,

18:11.724 --> 18:13.826
NEXT MINUTE I'M SUCKING DOWN
MINDY'S BRA WINE.

18:13.860 --> 18:14.861
YOU ATE A WHOLE HOUSE.

18:14.894 --> 18:15.762
NO, IT'S NOT JUST A HOUSE.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.598
IT'S AN ICON
OF AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.767
MAYBE I'M JUST A FAT GUY,
YOU KNOW.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.169
I MEAN,
I'M IN THE RIGHT COUNTRY FOR IT.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.770
AND I'M TALL,
SO I WEAR IT WELL.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.572
HEY, HEY, HEY, WHOEVER TOLD YOU
THAT WAS LYING.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.773
[sighs]
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:26.806 --> 18:27.840
OUR DEEPEST FEAR

18:27.874 --> 18:28.741
IS NOT THAT
WE'RE INADEQUATE.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.244
IT'S THAT WE'RE POWERFUL
BEYOND MEASURE.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.412
THAT'S A QUOTE

18:32.445 --> 18:33.846
FROM MY FRAT BUDDY,
PUBES.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.483
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO HIS ADVICE, PETER.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.684
YOU'RE SCARED.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.152
OTHERWISE YOU'D BE
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

18:39.186 --> 18:41.188
SOBER-SNOGGING
MARIA MENOUNOS.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.889
YOU MIGHT NOT BE
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE GUY,

18:42.922 --> 18:44.824
BUT SHE'S VULNERABLE,
AND YOU'RE HERE.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.160
YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE DRUNK.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.895
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.164
I AM HERE.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.265
AND THAT'S AS GOOD
A REASON AS ANY

18:52.299 --> 18:53.466
FOR A CHICK TO MAKE OUT WITH ME.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.801
LET'S GO GET 'EM,
SOBER BUDDY.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.169
(Mindy)
GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.538
PLEASE, FOR GOD'S SAKES,
GET OUT OF HERE.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.840
HEY.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.311
I WAS GONNA GO GET
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.513
YEAH.
I'M GONNA STAY.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.383
I GOTTA--
I GOTTA CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.220
OKAY.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.796
HI.
HELLO.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.365
I'M PETER.
I DON'T THINK WE GOT

19:25.398 --> 19:26.466
A CHANCE TO MEET BEFORE.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.335
HI, PETER.
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.804
WELL, COULD YOU LEAVE
YOUR BEAUTIFUL BODY HERE?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.540
OY.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.875
I HAVE AN EARLY REMOTE TO SHOOT
AT A CHRISTMAS TREE FARM

19:35.908 --> 19:37.910
IN CONNECTICUT TOMORROW.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.213
WHAT A THOUGHT-PROVOKING PIECE.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.582
MY BOYFRIEND WAS SUPPOSED
TO DRIVE ME THERE TONIGHT,

19:42.615 --> 19:43.650
BUT HE LEFT.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.884
I'D LOVE TO GIVE YOU A RIDE,

19:44.917 --> 19:45.985
BUT I'M TOO DRUNK.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.954
WAIT.
I'M NOT DRUNK AT ALL.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.622
I HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING
TO DRINK.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.657
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

19:50.690 --> 19:51.724
I'M SOBER AT A PARTY.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.992
I CAN GIVE YOU A RIDE.
ARE YOU SURE?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.261
YEAH.
IT'S LATE.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.262
NAH.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.729
WE DO HAVE
THOSE HOTEL ROOMS.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.566
WHAT, WHAT?
YOU COULD STAY THERE
IF YOU WANTED.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.301
I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT
VERY MUCH.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.303
ARE YOU SURE?
YES, I'M POSITIVE.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.337
REALLY?
YES.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.739
OKAY.
THANKS.

20:06.773 --> 20:07.807
YEAH.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.976
(woman)
* LAST CHRISTMAS

20:10.009 --> 20:12.879
WELL, PIGEON, I GUESS
IT'S JUST ME AND YOU NOW.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.282
GUESS TODAY
DIDN'T END UP AS--

20:15.315 --> 20:18.017
SURE.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.253
MINDY?

20:20.287 --> 20:21.421
CLIFF.
HEY.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.955
YOU CAME BACK.
YEAH.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.691
AND I BROUGHT YOU
SOME CONTRABAND.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.860
OH, MY GOD, THANK YOU!
GLUTEN IS MY FAVORITE FOOD.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.964
HEY, LISTEN, I REALLY WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.966
I KNOW YOU JUST
STARTED DATING SOMEBODY,

20:34.000 --> 20:34.934
BUT--
WAIT, WHAT?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.503
YEAH, THAT MIDWIFE

20:36.536 --> 20:38.738
AND THE LADY
FROM EXTRA! TOLD ME.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.706
AND WHEN I HEARD THAT,
I THOUGHT,

20:39.739 --> 20:40.573
"CLIFF, YOU KNOW,
THAT WINDOW IS CLOSING,

20:40.607 --> 20:42.542
AND YOU'RE GONNA MISS
YOUR CHANCE,"

20:42.575 --> 20:44.411
SO I LEFT, AND I BROKE IT
OFF WITH HEATHER.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.045
AND I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
OF A LONG SHOT.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.880
I DON'T KNOW
WHO THIS GUY IS YOU'RE DATING.

20:47.914 --> 20:48.881
HE'S PROBABLY, LIKE,
A STOCKBROKER

20:48.915 --> 20:50.750
OR A RACE CAR DRIVER
OR SOMETHING REALLY COOL.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.818
NO, IT'S YOU.

20:51.851 --> 20:52.952
I LIED
AND SAID IT WAS YOU,

20:52.985 --> 20:54.787
BECAUSE I'M CRAZY.
WHAT?

20:54.821 --> 20:55.955
HE'S A STOCKBROKER.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.424
OKAY, ANYWAY,
THE POINT IS

20:57.457 --> 20:58.725
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE WITH HIM,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.960
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO BE WITH ME.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.630
I WANT ME
TO BE WITH YOU TOO.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.064
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.601
I KNEW YOU WERE
A LITTLE BIT CRAZY.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.915
WAIT, WAIT,
I'M NOT CRAZY.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.417
YEAH,
YOU'RE KIND OF CRAZY.

21:24.451 --> 21:27.920
YOU WERE TALKING TO A PIGEON
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.860
(man)
GO TO BED.
