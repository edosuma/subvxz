I'd throw you free fries.

Not a big deal since

we wind up throwing out anyway

03:06.103 --> 03:08.022
from making too many

03:08.063 --> 03:10.649

03:08.063 --> 03:10.649
to call them wink-winkers

verbally cute-cutesy.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.997
It was a blanket moratorium

on anything cutesy

03:25.039 --> 03:26.957

- Cokes too.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.240
in three places.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.366
That's why it took

04:41.281 --> 04:43.366
so long to heal.

04:59.967 --> 05:00.968
Got caught in a tent last night

05:01.009 --> 05:02.469
with Annie from the grog booth.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.471
Oh, isn't she engaged

05:02.510 --> 05:04.471
to the fruit-ice guy?

05:04.512 --> 05:06.181
Yeah, and the fruit-ice guy

05:04.512 --> 05:06.181
comes back

05:06.223 --> 05:07.682
and there's Annie

05:06.223 --> 05:07.682
and Hay Bale

05:07.724 --> 05:09.101
so he tears

05:07.724 --> 05:09.101
the tent to pieces.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.310
- Hmm.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.310
- Yeah.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.519
Now the grog people

05:10.351 --> 05:11.519
have to hide her.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.230
They set up a fort

05:13.272 --> 05:15.023
- Crazy stuff.

- Luke?

05:19.569 --> 05:21.947
- What, T.J.?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.199
You're putting the pewter

05:21.989 --> 05:24.199
next to the turquoise?

05:24.241 --> 05:25.242
Looks like it.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.743
We don't usually put the pewter

05:26.785 --> 05:28.203

- Mm-hmm.

[slurps]

05:34.417 --> 05:36.419
Ahh.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.879
Might be why the pewter

ain't moving.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.342
Oh, hi, there.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.342
Uh, can I help you?

05:43.384 --> 05:45.971
Yeah. I'm looking for

05:43.384 --> 05:45.971
the Shakespeare stage.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.974
Okay, uh, you walk past

05:46.013 --> 05:48.974
the Calumba booth

05:49.016 --> 05:50.684
veer right

05:49.016 --> 05:50.684
at the drinking horns

05:50.725 --> 05:52.727
then left

05:50.725 --> 05:52.727
at the antler ark.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.353
- Thank you.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.353
- Mm-hmm.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.277
- Luke?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.277
- What, T.J.?

06:00.319 --> 06:01.569
You didn't use the approved

06:01.611 --> 06:02.988
faire language

06:01.611 --> 06:02.988
with that customer.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.199
Maverick, me.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.199
Don't forget that.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.701
There's undercover faire

06:05.240 --> 06:07.701
officials walking around.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.036
They look for

06:07.742 --> 06:09.036
that kind of stuff.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.578
Well, they should get real jobs.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.622
Would it kill you

06:10.620 --> 06:12.622
to shoot her a good morrow?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.499
Look, T.J..

06:16.251 --> 06:17.878
- I don't believe it.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.878
- I know.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.463
The Yanks went with Mussina.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.463
They should've gone with Brown.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.175
- You're watchin' TV!

06:20.505 --> 06:23.175
- I'm not ready for my nap.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.135
- You're milkin' it.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.135
- I'm convalescing.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.845
And you're milking me.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.845
But no more.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.224
Find some help, get a crutch,

06:26.887 --> 06:30.224
because by week's end, I'm gone.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.517
- Liz, you hearin' this?

06:30.265 --> 06:32.517
- What?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.435
Sorry. I was listening

06:32.559 --> 06:34.435
to my Deepak Chopra.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.147
I got things to do. I got

06:34.477 --> 06:37.147
a business, hopefully a life.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.817
Uh, prithee, you jest, good sir,

06:37.189 --> 06:40.817
and leave us short of hand?

06:40.859 --> 06:42.903
- I ain't jestin'.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.903
- But my arm!

06:42.944 --> 06:46.281
Had no trouble reaching into

06:42.944 --> 06:46.281
a tub of caramel corn last night

06:46.323 --> 06:48.033
while you were scratching

06:46.323 --> 06:48.033
yourself with the other.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.035
Your dexterity's fine.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.619
T.J., it's time

06:50.077 --> 06:51.619
for him to go.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.663
So you're gonna

06:51.661 --> 06:53.663
break up the team?

06:53.705 --> 06:56.499
I'm not good to ya.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.499
I'm not moving the pewter.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.630
Don't want you to get in trouble

07:00.461 --> 07:02.630
with the undercover squad.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.347
Hallo, and here we are.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.347
Room 518.

07:10.389 --> 07:13.433
A beautiful room, very special

07:10.389 --> 07:13.433
for you, Mrs. Gilmore.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.185
- It's nice.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.185
- It's hot.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.188
I will adjust the air for you.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.188
No problem on my end.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.315
It's a spectacular view.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.315
Very nice.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.816
A little balcony there.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.985
- It's different.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.985
- Something is different?

07:24.027 --> 07:26.321
The view.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.321
It's different.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.783
- Wow. It's pretty spectacular.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.783
- It's not the same.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.286
It's the same room you had

07:29.824 --> 07:32.286
two years ago,<i> signora,</i> 518.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.828
The ruins,

07:32.327 --> 07:33.828
they used to be closer.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.538
- Something move?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.538
- I don't think so.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.291
That pillar

07:35.580 --> 07:37.291
is in a different place.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.959
I think the ruins are

07:37.332 --> 07:38.959
probably where they've been

07:39.000 --> 07:41.044
for the past

07:39.000 --> 07:41.044
2000 years, grandma.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.046
We can get you another room,

07:41.086 --> 07:43.046
<i>signora.</i> No problem.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.798
No, no, it's fine.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.510
- Smokers.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.510
- I despise smokers.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.888
Rory, I told you before,

07:49.552 --> 07:51.888
you do not move luggage.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.723
Yes, yes, please.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.183
- We will do that.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.183
- 'Sorry.'

07:55.225 --> 07:56.851
Your high tea is still

07:55.225 --> 07:56.851
at the same time?

07:56.893 --> 07:59.187
<i>- Si, signora. </i>

07:56.893 --> 07:59.187
- We've to book private tours.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.897
The Vatican,

07:59.229 --> 08:00.897
the Villa Medici.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.732
And private,

08:00.939 --> 08:02.732
just the two of us.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.568
The concierge in Florence

08:02.774 --> 08:05.568
stuck us with a Belgian couple

08:05.610 --> 08:08.155
at the Uffizi who didn't know

08:05.610 --> 08:08.155
a fresco from a ferret hole.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.658
And the ruins of course. Make

08:08.196 --> 08:11.658
sure the guide's not too dry.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.742
So different.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.869
The hanging bags should be hung

08:14.911 --> 08:16.704
not laid on the bed.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.791
Excuse me. How far away

08:16.746 --> 08:19.791
are we from the catacombs?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.877
Close, but your grandmother

08:19.833 --> 08:22.877
would not like the catacombs.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.671
- Bones disturb her.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.671
- It's for me.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.631
My grandmother usually takes

08:24.712 --> 08:26.631
a nap this time of day

08:26.673 --> 08:27.882
so I go off

08:26.673 --> 08:27.882
and do my own thing.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.592
Ah, yes, a nap.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.220
We need two more pillows.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.931
I will see to it.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.931
Anything else I can do?

08:34.973 --> 08:36.808
That should do it.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.808
Thank you, Luciano.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.311
- Yeah, thank you very much.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.311
<i>- Grazie mille. Buona notte. </i>

08:39.353 --> 08:41.229
Good evening. Thank you.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.523
Let's sit down

08:41.271 --> 08:43.523
and pick our restaurants.

08:43.564 --> 08:47.068
That's three nights, that's

08:43.564 --> 08:47.068
three lunches and three dinners.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.946
We'll take our usual<i> passeggiata</i>

08:47.110 --> 08:49.946
around the Piazza Navona

08:49.988 --> 08:51.406
but let's pick

08:49.988 --> 08:51.406
the restaurants.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.700
Do you want to pick them

08:51.448 --> 08:53.700
before your nap or after?

08:53.741 --> 08:56.661
- I'm skipping my nap today.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.661
- Oh, really?

08:56.703 --> 08:58.872
Absolutely.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.872
I'm not the least bit tired.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.124
Oh, good.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.834
Couldn't hide it

09:01.166 --> 09:02.834
any better than that, huh?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.085
Hide what?

09:04.127 --> 09:05.420
I don't take my nap

09:05.462 --> 09:06.713
you don't get to go

09:05.462 --> 09:06.713
out on your own.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.466
Oh...grandma,

09:06.754 --> 09:09.466
I wasn't thinking that.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.343
Well, I was kidding.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.343
I'm exhausted.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.927
I'm not sure I'll even

09:11.385 --> 09:12.927
make it to the bedroom.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.679
I may just drop down

09:12.969 --> 09:14.679
here on the carpet.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.140
Thank you, grandma. It's all

09:14.721 --> 09:17.140
cultural stuff, I promise.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.226
Just kind of faster

09:17.182 --> 09:19.226
and funkier.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.810
Well, go enjoy your funk.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.103
- Thank you.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.103
- Mm-hmm.

09:23.855 --> 09:26.900
Say, when was the last time

09:23.855 --> 09:26.900
we called your mother?

09:26.941 --> 09:28.651
- Not sure.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.651
- Have we called her this week?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.945
- I think you did.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.945
- We'll call when you come back.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.073
- Okay. Bye.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.073
- Bye-bye.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.286
[instrumental music]

09:38.328 --> 09:40.330
- Morning.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.417
Oh, hey, Rob, I wanna keep these

09:40.372 --> 09:43.417
brochures neat in the rack here.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.335
None of them askew,

09:43.458 --> 09:45.335
otherwise it gives the place

09:45.377 --> 09:47.128
that we'll leave

09:45.377 --> 09:47.128
the light on for you feel

09:47.170 --> 09:48.213
that we're desperately

09:47.170 --> 09:48.213
trying to avoid.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.339
Yeah, I checked it.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.841
That is if we ultimately decide

09:51.883 --> 09:55.678
that we don't mind having

09:51.883 --> 09:55.678
brochures here in the lobby.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.389
The jury's still out on that.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.766
You know what?

09:57.431 --> 09:59.766
Jury's back. Brochures are out.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.684
I'll just take this

09:59.807 --> 10:01.684
in the office and..

10:03.437 --> 10:04.812
- Michel?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.812
- Good morning.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.606
- Um, what are you doing?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.606
- Hiding.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.648
- From me?

10:06.647 --> 10:07.648
- No.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.691
From?

10:08.733 --> 10:09.984
Suffice to say that my hiding

10:10.026 --> 10:11.445
is not costing

10:10.026 --> 10:11.445
the inn any income.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.029
In fact, I'm overdue for my ten.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.949
So consider this my ten,

10:13.071 --> 10:15.949
and you are conducting business

10:15.990 --> 10:17.951
with an employee

10:15.990 --> 10:17.951
who is officially on his ten

10:17.992 --> 10:19.911
which is in direct violation

10:17.992 --> 10:19.911
of union rules.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.121
You're not in a union.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.914
I'm in a union

10:21.162 --> 10:22.914
of oppressed Frenchmen.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.751
Oh, the UOF. Got it.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.751
Alright. Carry on.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.253
[sighs]

10:28.295 --> 10:30.589
Oh, hey, there is a spot

10:28.295 --> 10:30.589
on the floor over here

10:30.630 --> 10:31.923
that the vacuum

10:30.630 --> 10:31.923
never quite reaches.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.800
Let's make sure it does.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.800
Thank you.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.595
Hi. It's the Krumholtzes.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.595
How are you doing today?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.263
Great.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.263
Are you always here?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.015
I give that illusion.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.015
So what's on the agenda today?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.101
Mike and I would love

10:41.057 --> 10:43.101
to hit some antique stores.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.478
We can guide you

10:43.143 --> 10:44.478
to the best of them.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.354
But the kids would love

10:44.519 --> 10:46.354
to stay here.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.982
You got games and books, and

10:46.396 --> 10:48.982
they'd be bored stiff with us.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.151
They can absolutely stay here.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.151
There's always people around.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.986
- Is Michel going to be here?

10:51.192 --> 10:52.986
- Yes.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.695
Oh, good.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.695
He is their favorite.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.532
Michel? Have they met Michel?

10:54.737 --> 10:57.532
Have you met Michel?

10:57.574 --> 10:58.825
- He's funny!

10:57.574 --> 10:58.825
- Yeah!

10:58.866 --> 10:59.867
'They love him.'

10:59.909 --> 11:01.077
He chases them around

11:01.119 --> 11:03.037
and shouts

11:01.119 --> 11:03.037
and pretends to be mad

11:03.079 --> 11:04.747
'and they laugh and laugh.'

11:04.789 --> 11:06.791
Well, Michel is here

11:06.833 --> 11:09.085
and I'm sure he would be happy

11:06.833 --> 11:09.085
to look after you guys

11:09.127 --> 11:10.462
while your parents are gone.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.422
In fact, he's playing

11:10.504 --> 11:12.422
hide-and-seek right now

11:12.464 --> 11:14.549
and if you go over

11:12.464 --> 11:14.549
to the reception area

11:14.591 --> 11:16.884
I guarantee you'll be getting

11:14.591 --> 11:16.884
warm, warmer, hot.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.596
Goodie!

11:16.926 --> 11:19.596
Let's go. Come on.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.431
Have a good day.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.641
- Morning!

11:21.473 --> 11:22.641
- Good morning.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.225
Who needs coffee?

11:24.267 --> 11:26.102
Oh, I'll get you

11:24.267 --> 11:26.102
some coffee right there.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.605
Oh, hey, um,

11:26.144 --> 11:28.605
when Sookie gets in

11:28.647 --> 11:31.483
tell her I want to go over

11:28.647 --> 11:31.483
the layout for the dinner menu.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.985
I wanna go another way.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.985
I'll be in my office. Thank you.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.450
Hey, you found him.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.450
Good job, Krumholtzes.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.786
He grounded us and told us

11:40.492 --> 11:43.786
to go do something to ourselves.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.246
He used a dirty word.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.499
And I'm destined

11:45.288 --> 11:47.499
to use many more.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.000
No, you're not.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.000
Come here.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.003
It is not my job

11:49.042 --> 11:52.003
to entertain little people.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.297
Michel, the Krumholtzes

11:52.045 --> 11:54.297
are in our most expensive room.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.090
We need people like

11:54.339 --> 11:56.090
them to be happy

11:56.132 --> 11:58.301
so they tell other people

11:56.132 --> 11:58.301
like them they<i> were</i> happy.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.470
Because we are a new business,

11:58.343 --> 12:00.470
and we all have to go

12:00.512 --> 12:03.598
above and beyond the call of

12:00.512 --> 12:03.598
duty until we are established.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.559
- So you watch them.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.559
- I hate kids.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.645
- This isn't fair.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.645
- You're a profit participant.

12:08.687 --> 12:13.525
Happy Krumholtzes equal

12:08.687 --> 12:13.525
lots of profits, participant.

12:13.567 --> 12:17.153
Who wants to play some

12:13.567 --> 12:17.153
insipid board game with me?

12:17.195 --> 12:19.197
We want to play

12:17.195 --> 12:19.197
an insipid board game!

12:19.239 --> 12:20.240
Yeah! Come on.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.240
Let's play Chinese checkers!

12:20.281 --> 12:21.700
[cellphone rings]

12:21.740 --> 12:23.368
- Hello?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.368
- 'Lorelai, it's your mother!'

12:23.410 --> 12:25.036
- Hi, mom.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.036
- 'I'm calling from Rome!'

12:25.078 --> 12:27.080
Yeah. The line is crystal clear,

12:25.078 --> 12:27.080
mom. You don't have to yell.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.956
Sorry, I still think

12:27.121 --> 12:28.956
transcontinental calls

12:28.998 --> 12:30.333
are a bigger deal

12:28.998 --> 12:30.333
than they are.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.085
Yeah. You're coming

12:30.375 --> 12:32.085
in fine. So, Rome?

12:32.126 --> 12:34.379
Our last stop, and a good thing,

12:32.126 --> 12:34.379
too because I don't know

12:34.421 --> 12:37.006
how long I can keep

12:34.421 --> 12:37.006
these randy European men off me.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.467
- Excuse me?

12:37.048 --> 12:39.467
- 'They're terrible flirts.'

12:39.509 --> 12:41.386
'Gorgeous but so forward.'

12:41.428 --> 12:44.305
- 'You want to talk to Rory?'

12:41.428 --> 12:44.305
- Oh, um, sure.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.515
- Is she there?

12:44.347 --> 12:45.515
- Yes, she is.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.141
Hang on. Rory!

12:50.520 --> 12:52.355
- Hello?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.355
- 'Hi.'

12:52.397 --> 12:54.441
- Hi.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.441
- So, Rome?

12:54.482 --> 12:57.485
- 'Yep.'

12:54.482 --> 12:57.485
- Weather good?

12:57.527 --> 12:59.404
Hot in the day,

12:57.527 --> 12:59.404
cooler at night.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.155
Uh-huh. Well, that's kind

12:59.446 --> 13:01.155
of what we're having here.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.283
Huh.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.743
Coinky-dink.

13:04.783 --> 13:08.913
- Yeah. So..

13:04.783 --> 13:08.913
- So..

13:08.955 --> 13:11.416
Um, I guess I'll be seeing you

13:08.955 --> 13:11.416
in a couple of days.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.543
'Yep.'

13:13.585 --> 13:15.878
Great, then. Be safe, and watch

13:13.585 --> 13:15.878
out for those Italian men

13:15.920 --> 13:16.963
especially

13:15.920 --> 13:16.963
the ones named Randy.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.257
- I will. Bye.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.257
- 'Bye.'

13:24.345 --> 13:25.804
Didn't look like a quarter

13:24.345 --> 13:25.804
would bounce off it.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.099
Got to have

13:25.846 --> 13:28.099
those bouncing quarters.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.564
(Emily)

13:31.394 --> 13:34.564
'I think the pink purse with

13:31.394 --> 13:34.564
the gold clasp is my favorite.'

13:34.606 --> 13:37.024
We probably could have gotten

13:34.606 --> 13:37.024
all this stuff at home, grandma.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.401
Now we have to pay

13:37.066 --> 13:38.401
duty on them.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.986
But if you buy them

13:38.443 --> 13:39.986
back in the States

13:40.027 --> 13:41.696
then you can't say

13:40.027 --> 13:41.696
I picked this up in Rome.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.990
<i>Buon giorno.</i> Hello.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.990
May I help you, please?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.032
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

13:45.074 --> 13:47.661
[speaking Italian]

13:47.702 --> 13:52.165
<i>Ah, la bellissima signora</i>

13:47.702 --> 13:52.165
<i>parlo Italiano molto bene.</i>

13:52.206 --> 13:54.250
<i>Grazie.</i> He called me

13:52.206 --> 13:54.250
pretty lady.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.293
It just never stops.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.795
You got the gams, grandma.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.756
[speaking Italian]

14:04.803 --> 14:06.471
'Rory?'

14:06.513 --> 14:07.514
- Rory?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.514
- Huh?

14:07.555 --> 14:08.889
What do you want?

14:08.931 --> 14:11.476
Oh. A triple espresso.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.936
[speaking Italian]

14:17.524 --> 14:18.608
<i>Si, signora.</i>

14:18.650 --> 14:21.152
[chuckles]

14:18.650 --> 14:21.152
He won't stop.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.112
[speaking Italian]

14:26.115 --> 14:28.660
[laughing]

14:28.702 --> 14:31.287
The fact is we've got

14:28.702 --> 14:31.287
five original songs

14:31.329 --> 14:33.373
ready to play live,

14:31.329 --> 14:33.373
a 40 minute gig

14:33.414 --> 14:35.542
means we can fill it out

14:33.414 --> 14:35.542
with six or seven covers.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.959
- No Problem.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.959
- Problem.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.503
Our covers are tight

14:37.001 --> 14:38.503
and people dig 'em.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.296
We play

14:38.545 --> 14:40.296
"Fell In Love With A Girl"

14:40.338 --> 14:41.964
as good as the White Stripes

14:40.338 --> 14:41.964
so how is one of our originals

14:42.006 --> 14:43.341
gonna stack up coming after it?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.676
We could play all

14:43.383 --> 14:44.676
our originals up top

14:44.718 --> 14:45.719
then close with our covers.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.011
That's asymmetrical

14:47.053 --> 14:48.054
and we could lose

14:47.053 --> 14:48.054
our audience if we play

14:48.095 --> 14:49.389
a bunch of originals in a row.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.224
Our covers

14:49.430 --> 14:51.224
are just too good.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.434
I say we cut any cover song

14:51.265 --> 14:53.434
that overpowers our originals.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.521
- So no "Suffragette City."

14:53.476 --> 14:56.521
- And no White Stripes.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.732
"Lithium" is gone,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.732
the Radiohead, both Pixies.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.692
- 'No Dandy Warhols.'

14:58.773 --> 15:00.692
- 'Or Velvet Underground.'

15:00.734 --> 15:03.486
Wait, guys. You're cutting

15:00.734 --> 15:03.486
every good cover song we play.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.864
But maybe that's the key.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.907
Yeah, yeah, if we play

15:05.905 --> 15:07.907
nothing but crappy covers

15:07.948 --> 15:09.075
our originals

15:07.948 --> 15:09.075
will stand out.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.618
- Brilliant.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.618
- What?

15:10.660 --> 15:13.204
- Anything by Men at Work.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.204
- Or Chicago, wings.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.247
- Styx.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.247
- Culture club.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.582
We throw in a Quarterflash

15:15.623 --> 15:16.791
'they'll be eating

15:15.623 --> 15:16.791
out of our hands.'

15:16.833 --> 15:18.501
Okay. This is just kooky.

15:18.543 --> 15:21.254
Now I say we reconvene tonight

15:18.543 --> 15:21.254
and figure it out then.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.758
- I got to get to work, anyway.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.758
- I'll see you at home tonight.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.718
- I'll get you some more water?

15:24.799 --> 15:26.718
- Thanks.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.721
Well, hello.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.138
- Hey, there.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.138
- Hi, Zack.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.891
Trina, how you doing?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.976
Cheryl, come on.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.976
Shoot me some.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.937
Come this way.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.022
You sit there.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.022
I want you to sit right here.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.741
- It's your turn.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.741
- Really?

15:49.783 --> 15:52.744
That fact has not changed since

15:49.783 --> 15:52.744
you said it ten seconds ago?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.412
[both giggle]

15:54.454 --> 15:56.038
If you lose,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.038
will you do that thing

15:56.080 --> 15:58.332
where you pretend to get all mad

15:56.080 --> 15:58.332
and you hit the board

15:58.374 --> 16:00.251
and send the marbles

15:58.374 --> 16:00.251
flying all around?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.754
- Yeah!

16:00.293 --> 16:02.754
- I am not going to lose.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.005
Hi, kids. Michel, do we have

16:02.796 --> 16:05.005
any AA batteries?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.299
How can a man play

16:05.047 --> 16:06.299
Chinese checkers

16:06.340 --> 16:07.675
with all these

16:06.340 --> 16:07.675
interruptions?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.719
Oh, man. They're still

16:07.717 --> 16:09.719
not vacuuming that spot.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.387
It's your turn, Michel.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.598
- Redundant little rodent.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.598
- Michel, the batteries?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.350
In the office, far-right

16:13.640 --> 16:16.350
drawer of the credenza.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.393
Damn!

16:17.435 --> 16:18.645
Is where water is stored

16:18.686 --> 16:20.313
to power electrical facilities.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.982
- Thanks, Michel.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.982
- It's your turn again.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.026
Why are the dining room tables

16:23.023 --> 16:26.026
always, always out of place?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.570
[Lorelai sighs]

16:30.573 --> 16:32.408
Lorelai.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.785
Excuse me.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.913
Okay, okay.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.913
Table's perfect now.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.706
Who keeps moving them

16:36.955 --> 16:38.706
out of place? I want a name.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.708
Uh, cruel, sadistic

16:38.748 --> 16:40.708
table fairies?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.126
Come into the pantry

16:40.750 --> 16:42.126
with me, here.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.754
I can give you a minute.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.754
That's it. Ooh.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.507
I've been trying to figure out

16:44.796 --> 16:47.507
a way how to bring this up..

16:47.548 --> 16:49.175
- What's that?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.175
- I cleared a plate.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.426
You don't clear plates.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.761
The plate was empty,

16:50.468 --> 16:51.761
so I grabbed it.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.054
Give me the plate.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.054
You've gone nutty!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.598
- What?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.598
- Now you're mad.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.767
I hate making you mad.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.767
I have the worst people skills.

16:57.809 --> 16:58.601
I'm not mad...

16:58.643 --> 16:59.686
or nutty.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.187
But you are,

16:59.727 --> 17:01.187
and you have been for weeks.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.189
I mean, the nutty don't usually

17:01.228 --> 17:03.189
know that they're nutty.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.024
- Thus the nutty.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.024
- Sookie, I'm very busy.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.901
- Doing other people's work.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.901
- I am not.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.903
It's your job to change sheets,

17:06.943 --> 17:08.903
fluff pillows?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.237
- No.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.237
- Brush the horses?

17:10.279 --> 17:11.572
Fold the points

17:10.279 --> 17:11.572
on the toilet paper?

17:11.614 --> 17:13.240
Sookie, we're breaking

17:11.614 --> 17:13.240
in new people.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.075
- I'm picking up the slack.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.075
- I'm new? Michel's new?

17:15.117 --> 17:16.619
I'm not doing your jobs.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.454
Two weeks ago, I come in,

17:16.661 --> 17:18.454
and my refrigerator

17:18.496 --> 17:19.873
which is sorted

17:18.496 --> 17:19.873
by a system

17:19.914 --> 17:21.916
that I have honed

17:19.914 --> 17:21.916
for ten straight years

17:21.958 --> 17:23.751
is completely rearranged.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.252
'The beets are on the top.'

17:25.294 --> 17:26.880
'The vegetables

17:25.294 --> 17:26.880
are on the bottom.'

17:26.921 --> 17:28.923
It's "Apocalypse Now," baby!

17:28.965 --> 17:31.634
I yelled at the staff,

17:28.965 --> 17:31.634
but now I know.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.470
- It was you.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.470
- It was messy.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.096
It was<i> my</i> messy.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.849
I couldn't find anything

17:36.138 --> 17:37.849
in there for days.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.475
I kept reaching in

17:37.891 --> 17:39.475
for strawberries

17:39.517 --> 17:41.811
and coming up with liver,

17:39.517 --> 17:41.811
that's not pleasant.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.521
I promise not to touch

17:41.853 --> 17:43.521
the fridge again.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.939
You're yelling at the employees.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.733
- You never yelled before.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.733
- I'm yelling?

17:46.774 --> 17:48.401
And you've got to go home

17:46.774 --> 17:48.401
once in a while.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.153
Sookie, we're a new business.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.153
It's time-consuming.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.864
How many times have you fallen

17:51.195 --> 17:52.864
asleep at your desk

17:52.906 --> 17:54.114
'in that stupid office

17:52.906 --> 17:54.114
of yours?'

17:54.156 --> 17:55.825
- Once.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.825
- No.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.535
Once, you fell asleep

17:55.867 --> 17:57.535
on a stapler.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.328
The whole next day,

17:57.577 --> 17:59.328
you had "Swingline"

17:59.370 --> 18:01.205
printed backwards

17:59.370 --> 18:01.205
across your face.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.165
But you've fallen asleep

18:01.247 --> 18:03.165
at that desk 100 times.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.044
Well, I'm here when I'm here.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.044
I can't change that, I'm sorry.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.295
Want to know the last time

18:06.085 --> 18:08.295
that I saw staff and maids

18:08.337 --> 18:09.672
looking this scared

18:08.337 --> 18:09.672
of their boss?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.090
Your mother's house.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.384
Ow! Knife in the gut!

18:13.426 --> 18:15.094
Well, I'm sorry to deal

18:13.426 --> 18:15.094
from the bottom of the deck

18:15.135 --> 18:17.555
but that's reality.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.349
Well...I am pretty burned out.

18:20.391 --> 18:23.519
Me too. We all are.

18:20.391 --> 18:23.519
It's been hard.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.607
- I will take a break.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.607
- Good.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.275
Not this week,

18:27.648 --> 18:29.275
'cause stuff's been piling up.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.735
But not next week.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.029
- 'God. I don't know.'

18:30.777 --> 18:33.029
- Now.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.989
Uh-oh. Hey, stop!

18:35.031 --> 18:36.407
Wait, I'm being kidnapped!

18:36.449 --> 18:37.825
Go home and relax.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.285
I have no one

18:37.867 --> 18:39.285
to hang out with.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.870
I'll hang out with you

18:39.326 --> 18:40.870
sometime this week.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.539
I need a break too.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.539
We'll have a girlfriend day.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.042
We'll get manicures and

18:43.581 --> 18:46.042
jump rope and talk about boys.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.251
The whole cliche thing.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.336
Now go! Go and don't

18:47.293 --> 18:49.336
stop for nothing.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.047
Okay, okay.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.047
I promise.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.841
- 'Aah!'

18:51.089 --> 18:53.841
- 'Yeah. Do it again!'

18:53.883 --> 18:56.176
Hold it. Hold it!

18:56.218 --> 18:58.972
Good girl.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.972
Now, get your things and go.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.431
[sighs]

19:06.646 --> 19:07.772
Oh, hey.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.025
Um, Bob, are you sure

19:07.814 --> 19:11.025
you want to..

19:11.067 --> 19:13.193
Nope. Keep going.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.154
[cellphone ringing]

19:18.032 --> 19:19.533
- Hello?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.533
- It's me.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.036
- Oh. Hello.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.036
- Bad time? Are you busy?

19:22.078 --> 19:24.413
Uh, trying not to be.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.413
How are you doing?

19:24.455 --> 19:26.332
Good. You?

19:26.373 --> 19:27.458
'Good.'

19:29.418 --> 19:33.422
I was at the corner

19:29.418 --> 19:33.422
of Bark and Cheese today.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.675
Bark and Cheese? Really?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.551
And it's exactly the same.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.720
Exactly the same?

19:39.762 --> 19:41.722
Was-was there a tiny,

19:39.762 --> 19:41.722
little Italian dog

19:41.764 --> 19:43.891
'in a basket barking

19:41.764 --> 19:43.891
the whole time you were there?'

19:43.933 --> 19:46.352
Not this time, but I definitely

19:43.933 --> 19:46.352
had flashbacks.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.604
And did you have a nice piece

19:46.393 --> 19:48.604
of cheese with your coffee?

19:48.646 --> 19:51.649
I still say I said the correct

19:48.646 --> 19:51.649
word for cream in Italian.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.317
I even pointed at my coffee

19:51.691 --> 19:53.317
when I asked for it.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.902
How could I be asking

19:53.359 --> 19:54.902
for cheese?

19:54.944 --> 19:56.946
- But cheese you were brought.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.946
- Stinky cheese.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.323
- The worst, don't forget

19:56.988 --> 19:59.323
- That you proceeded to eat.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.241
Because I hate people who make

19:59.365 --> 20:01.241
mistakes when they order

20:01.283 --> 20:02.994
especially

20:01.283 --> 20:02.994
in a foreign country

20:03.036 --> 20:04.871
and then make a big to-do

20:03.036 --> 20:04.871
when they get the wrong thing.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.413
'Ugly Americans. Yuck.'

20:06.455 --> 20:09.167
Aha! You admit it was a mistake.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.167
You did say cheese.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.086
I know French, a bit of Spanish,

20:09.208 --> 20:12.086
but my Italian, not so good.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.380
Being trilingual

20:12.128 --> 20:14.380
is plenty for a young lady.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.883
Yeah. Mom?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.592
'Yeah?'

20:18.634 --> 20:19.844
I'm sorry.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.929
[sighs]

20:19.886 --> 20:21.929
It's okay.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.973
I screwed up.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.933
I screwed up so bad.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.602
- 'I handled everything wrong.'

20:25.975 --> 20:28.602
- Oh, honey.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.815
I keep reliving everything

20:28.644 --> 20:32.815
over and over. It's such a mess.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.818
I just want to fix it.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.818
I<i> have</i> to fix it.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.320
- You will.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.320
- 'I know. I just..'

20:38.362 --> 20:40.489
- I need a favor.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.489
- Okay.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.159
- 'It's big.'

20:40.531 --> 20:43.159
- Okay.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.661
I wrote a letter..

20:45.703 --> 20:47.621
...to Dean.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.207
'Could you get it to him?'

20:49.248 --> 20:50.583
Oh..

20:50.624 --> 20:52.001
I don't know

20:50.624 --> 20:52.001
how else to do it.

20:52.043 --> 20:55.838
I can't just mail it

20:52.043 --> 20:55.838
to his apartment.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.007
- It's a big favor.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.007
- Honey, I don't know.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.967
It's a lot to ask,

20:58.049 --> 20:59.967
but I think that

21:00.009 --> 21:01.343
this will make

21:00.009 --> 21:01.343
everything better.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.429
Please.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.429
I can't wait until I get home.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.305
'I have to do something now.'

21:05.347 --> 21:07.474
A letter, huh?

21:07.516 --> 21:10.144
Well, get it to me,

21:07.516 --> 21:10.144
and I will get it to him.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.146
Thank you. Thank you.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.314
Have some espresso

21:12.188 --> 21:14.314
and limburger for me.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.568
I will.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.568
I love you, mom.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.446
I love you, too. Bye.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.822
Bye.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.703
You know, I think if you

21:25.659 --> 21:27.703
made it a little fuller--

21:27.745 --> 21:29.914
- Go!

21:27.745 --> 21:29.914
- Going.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.040
[sighs]

21:32.959 --> 21:36.254
I want to thank thee, kind lady,

21:32.959 --> 21:36.254
for your purchase.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.505
Please take

21:36.295 --> 21:38.505
one of my cards.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.174
Note the website.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.468
And do enjoy

21:40.216 --> 21:42.468
your day at the faire.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.303
Thanks.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.597
I am kickin' ass!

21:46.639 --> 21:48.390
Who knew I was

21:46.639 --> 21:48.390
a master salesman?

21:48.432 --> 21:50.810
Hmm. So I'm all packed

21:48.432 --> 21:50.810
and ready to go.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.770
Good, and don't worry

21:50.851 --> 21:52.770
about nothing

21:52.812 --> 21:54.647
'cause we're all

21:52.812 --> 21:54.647
cool here.

21:54.688 --> 21:55.731
Well, that's the thing.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.650
In ten years, I could die.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.902
And they could very well

21:57.691 --> 21:59.902
trace it back to this moment.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.988
"He got back up

21:59.944 --> 22:01.988
on his feet too fast."

22:02.029 --> 22:04.115
That's what they can say.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.992
It's weird when people

22:04.157 --> 22:05.992
who aren't doctors

22:06.033 --> 22:07.618
start thinking

22:06.033 --> 22:07.618
they're doctors.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.869
He'll be fine.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.830
Gosh, I was so worried.

22:10.871 --> 22:14.292
So, I'm gonna make a phone call,

22:10.871 --> 22:14.292
and then I'll go.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.334
Okay.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.794
Oh, hey, hon..

22:16.836 --> 22:19.588
...could you try

22:16.836 --> 22:19.588
and get this cashbox open?

22:19.630 --> 22:21.757
- It's stuck again.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.757
- If you want.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.843
It's just I was holding

22:21.799 --> 22:23.843
this screwdriver before

22:23.884 --> 22:25.761
and I almost blacked out.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.596
- I'll try again.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.596
- Thanks.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.642
[grunts]

22:34.145 --> 22:35.562
Luke!

22:35.604 --> 22:37.106
Don't forget

22:35.604 --> 22:37.106
the undercover guys.

22:37.148 --> 22:38.774
They look for cellphones.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.901
I'll keep an eye out.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.279
Luke, I'm being

22:40.943 --> 22:43.279
your friend here.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.157
[Luke sighs]

22:46.199 --> 22:47.407
[telephone ringing]

22:50.036 --> 22:51.329
- Hello?

22:50.036 --> 22:51.329
- Hey, it's me.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.789
Well, huzzah and prithee.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.789
Art thou--

22:53.831 --> 22:56.125
- Stop.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.125
- 'Sorry. How are you?'

22:56.167 --> 22:58.211
Sorry, that was incomplete.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.211
How are you, you big, fat liar?

22:58.252 --> 22:59.545
What?

22:59.586 --> 23:01.672
You said you would

22:59.586 --> 23:01.672
be home yesterday.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.867
'I hate you, Dean!

29:01.699 --> 29:03.867
I hate everything!'

29:03.909 --> 29:05.202
(Dean)

29:03.909 --> 29:05.202
'Let's just talk.'

29:05.244 --> 29:06.953
I don't want to talk!

29:05.244 --> 29:06.953
I don't want you here!

29:06.995 --> 29:09.289
- 'I'm sorry, okay.'

29:06.995 --> 29:09.289
- 'You're sorry?'

29:09.331 --> 29:11.417
- Oh, my God.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.544
- You've got my--

29:11.458 --> 29:13.544
- Don't you dare!

29:13.586 --> 29:17.130
Well, that's what happens

29:13.586 --> 29:17.130
when you get married too young.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.633
- Yeah, that must be it.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.633
- 'This is juicy.'

29:19.675 --> 29:21.427
...you know what?

29:19.675 --> 29:21.427
You didn't do it.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.011
I usually only get

29:21.468 --> 29:23.011
to hear about these things.

29:23.053 --> 29:24.304
I never get to see them.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.098
(Dean) 'Can we do something?

29:24.346 --> 29:26.098
Can we get over this?'

29:26.139 --> 29:28.892
Lucky us. Come on.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.892
(Lindsay) 'Too late!

29:26.139 --> 29:28.892
Look out the window!'

29:28.934 --> 29:30.352
(Lindsay)

29:28.934 --> 29:30.352
'I hate you, Dean.'

29:30.603 --> 29:32.187
But you definitely prepped

29:30.603 --> 29:32.187
the sauce for the duck?

29:32.229 --> 29:33.146
Because the duck

29:32.229 --> 29:33.146
without the sauce

29:33.188 --> 29:35.190
is the duck

29:33.188 --> 29:35.190
that we can't use.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.109
The sauce has to be

29:35.232 --> 29:37.109
prepped early.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.236
I-I know you said it.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.236
Say it again.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.613
Stop saying let it go!

29:40.654 --> 29:42.906
Stop saying let it go, John.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.906
Stop it.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.284
Stop it!

29:42.948 --> 29:45.284
I am letting it go.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.536
I just need you to assure me

29:45.325 --> 29:47.536
that everything's getting done

29:47.578 --> 29:50.497
so that I know

29:47.578 --> 29:50.497
I can fully let it go.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.791
- 'Hello?'

29:50.539 --> 29:52.791
- Kitchen!

29:52.832 --> 29:54.752
Okay, I am hanging up,

29:52.832 --> 29:54.752
but I am not letting it go!

29:54.793 --> 29:57.379
- Mom!

29:54.793 --> 29:57.379
- Oh, my traveler.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.465
- I missed you.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.465
- I missed you too.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.716
Sookie!

30:00.758 --> 30:03.719
You remember who I am!

30:03.761 --> 30:05.971
- 'Hello!'

30:03.761 --> 30:05.971
- Hi.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.557
Hello, Lorelai.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.557
Hello, Sookie.

30:08.599 --> 30:09.725
- Hi, Emily.

30:08.599 --> 30:09.725
- Hi, mom.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.184
Don't. I smell like airplane.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.811
I guess I should

30:11.226 --> 30:12.811
go get my bags.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.730
Rory, you do not touch bags.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.690
Oh, I thought that was

30:14.772 --> 30:16.690
just a Europe thing.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.275
The driver's

30:16.732 --> 30:18.275
bringing them in.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.027
Oh, we had such a trip.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.027
Rory will fill you in.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.738
Spare her the more

30:21.069 --> 30:22.738
salacious aspects.

30:22.780 --> 30:23.989
Salacious aspects?

30:24.030 --> 30:25.491
Those European men

30:25.532 --> 30:27.493
young, old, in between,

30:25.532 --> 30:27.493
they saw us coming.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.744
They saw you coming where?

30:28.786 --> 30:30.621
We were like magnets.

30:28.786 --> 30:30.621
Such high libidos.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.289
You weren't

30:30.663 --> 30:32.289
walking around wearing

30:32.331 --> 30:34.374
your hot and wealthy

30:32.331 --> 30:34.374
sandwich board, were you, mom?

30:34.416 --> 30:37.127
- She was very popular.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.127
- Well, I should go.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.421
I bring you back

30:37.169 --> 30:39.421
a charming, cultured

30:39.463 --> 30:41.715
well-mannered young lady,

30:39.463 --> 30:41.715
don't undo it.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.801
I will definitely try

30:41.757 --> 30:43.801
not to not undo it.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.636
Well, goodbye, all.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.636
Goodbye, Rory.

30:45.678 --> 30:48.347
- Bye, grandma.

30:45.678 --> 30:48.347
- Nope. Airplane.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.974
Oh, I can take it.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.974
Thanks, grandma.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.476
<i>Ciao.</i>

30:52.518 --> 30:54.812
Come here, you.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.396
So, what are you guys

30:54.853 --> 30:56.396
doing home?

30:56.438 --> 30:58.357
Well, we're trying to get

30:56.438 --> 30:58.357
some distance from the inn.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.941
And it's going

30:58.398 --> 30:59.941
through the roof.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.777
Not the inn's roof,

30:59.983 --> 31:01.777
that's solid as a rock.

31:01.819 --> 31:04.780
You know what I mean.

31:01.819 --> 31:04.780
We're booked to 90% capacity.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.657
And the restaurant,

31:04.822 --> 31:06.657
we're turning people away.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.784
- Oh, you know all that.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.784
- No, no, keep going.

31:08.826 --> 31:11.620
Well, customers agree

31:08.826 --> 31:11.620
that despite Michel

31:11.662 --> 31:13.330
we're their favorite

31:11.662 --> 31:13.330
Connecticut inn.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.207
Oh, but, that's nothing

31:13.372 --> 31:15.207
compared to the big town news.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.291
- Wow! What?

31:15.248 --> 31:16.291
- Sookie--

31:16.333 --> 31:17.959
We walked past Dean's place

31:18.001 --> 31:19.753
and Lindsay was throwing

31:18.001 --> 31:19.753
his stuff out on the street.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.921
'They were really going at it.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.921
It was like "Raging Bull."'

31:21.963 --> 31:23.632
There's yelling

31:21.963 --> 31:23.632
and screaming--

31:23.674 --> 31:26.426
Whoo, Sookie, you're exploding

31:23.674 --> 31:26.426
all over the poor girl.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.762
- Oh, sorry.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.762
- And she's probably hungry.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.055
You're hungry, right, honey?

31:30.096 --> 31:31.724
- Oh, I'll whip us something up.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.724
- Oh, no.

31:31.765 --> 31:33.767
Well, you said you had to pick

31:31.765 --> 31:33.767
up Davey, so we'll go out.

31:33.809 --> 31:34.893
You know?

31:33.809 --> 31:34.893
We'll call you later.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.812
- Okay.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.812
- Okay, let's go.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.899
[instrumental music]

31:43.235 --> 31:44.403
Talk to you later.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.657
See you later, Sookie.

31:48.699 --> 31:50.659
What happened?

31:50.701 --> 31:53.453
It was unbelievable.

31:50.701 --> 31:53.453
It was bad.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.623
She was yelling,

31:53.495 --> 31:56.623
she was throwing things.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.458
He was yelling,

31:56.665 --> 31:58.458
she called him a jerk.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.793
It was very violent

31:58.500 --> 31:59.793
and very public.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.879
Other people saw it.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.879
It was horrible.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.506
This was not

32:01.920 --> 32:04.506
supposed to happen.

32:04.548 --> 32:07.342
You! You should be ashamed

32:04.548 --> 32:07.342
of yourself, what you did!

32:07.384 --> 32:09.469
- Just wait.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.469
- What did she ever do to you?

32:09.511 --> 32:11.930
How did she hurt you?

32:09.511 --> 32:11.930
Why are you doing this?

32:11.971 --> 32:14.266
- Theresa, please. Calm down.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.266
- Calm down?

32:14.307 --> 32:15.642
My little girl

32:14.307 --> 32:15.642
has to come home

32:15.684 --> 32:18.228
and find your heinous letter

32:15.684 --> 32:18.228
in Dean's jacket.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.230
- Look, we're in the street--

32:18.270 --> 32:20.230
- You little monster!

32:20.272 --> 32:22.148
Hey! Pull back, lady!

32:22.190 --> 32:23.442
There aren't other boys

32:22.190 --> 32:23.442
in the world?

32:23.483 --> 32:24.902
Do you have to go after

32:23.483 --> 32:24.902
her husband?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.945
Okay. Stop attacking

32:24.943 --> 32:26.945
my daughter right now.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.697
You're upset, I get it,

32:26.986 --> 32:28.697
but you do not do this.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.156
'She slept with my son-in-law.'

32:30.198 --> 32:31.950
'She broke up a marriage.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.950
Are you proud?'

32:31.991 --> 32:33.619
(Lorelai)

32:31.991 --> 32:33.619
'She didn't break

32:31.991 --> 32:33.619
up a marriage.'

32:33.660 --> 32:36.037
- 'What do you know of this?'

32:33.660 --> 32:36.037
- Enough. I know Rory.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.498
Well, all I know is that

32:36.079 --> 32:38.498
now my Lindsay is devastated

32:38.540 --> 32:41.126
Dean is back with his parents,

32:38.540 --> 32:41.126
lives are destroyed

32:41.167 --> 32:43.670
and you and your daughter

32:41.167 --> 32:43.670
can go to hell!

32:47.382 --> 32:48.759
[clears throat]

32:50.928 --> 32:53.096
Okay, I have got to know

32:50.928 --> 32:53.096
what was in that letter.

32:54.598 --> 32:55.808
Um..

32:57.684 --> 32:59.018
I..

33:00.729 --> 33:03.148
I told him..

33:03.189 --> 33:07.193
...that...that

33:03.189 --> 33:07.193
night was special

33:07.235 --> 33:10.906
and...that I wasn't sorry

33:07.235 --> 33:10.906
that it happened.

33:12.908 --> 33:15.744
But he's married, and..

33:15.786 --> 33:17.162
...he has to figure out

33:15.786 --> 33:17.162
his life.

33:17.203 --> 33:21.291
So I was going to make it

33:17.203 --> 33:21.291
easier for him

33:21.333 --> 33:23.209
and take myself

33:21.333 --> 33:23.209
out of the mix.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.923
Well, that was

33:26.087 --> 33:27.923
a very good letter.

33:27.965 --> 33:30.467
I can't believe

33:27.965 --> 33:30.467
she found it.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.886
- We can't keep standing here.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.886
- I know.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.763
These streets

33:32.928 --> 33:34.763
are dangerous right now.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.390
- Very.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.390
- Come on.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.643
Anything you want is on me.

33:39.685 --> 33:44.523
Pie, cake, pancakes, pan pie,

33:39.685 --> 33:44.523
cake pan, panacockin.

33:44.564 --> 33:47.818
Say the word or make one up.

33:44.564 --> 33:47.818
It's yours.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.152
Chair feels good.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.446
Yeah, yeah.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.446
A chair does feel good.

33:51.488 --> 33:52.990
I think a root beer

33:51.488 --> 33:52.990
might be good.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.533
Root beer sounds good!

33:54.574 --> 33:56.702
It's on the house,

33:54.574 --> 33:56.702
so go crazy.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.411
- Luke!

33:56.743 --> 33:58.411
- Hey.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.079
- Hi, Rory. Welcome back.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.079
- Thanks.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.206
You okay?

34:00.121 --> 34:01.206
You look a little pale.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.500
You know, pale's the new tan.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.127
[chuckles]

34:03.542 --> 34:06.127
So, you're here.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.296
- You're not a mirage.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.296
- I told you I was coming back.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.340
Yes, but you lied to me

34:08.338 --> 34:10.340
repeatedly for weeks

34:10.382 --> 34:11.633
so your credibility's

34:10.382 --> 34:11.633
been shattered.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.677
I know.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.677
It's been seven weeks.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.221
Seven weeks.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.222
[chuckles]

34:19.307 --> 34:20.976
[clears throat]

34:21.018 --> 34:23.520
You know, I just remembered,

34:21.018 --> 34:23.520
I-I have an errand to run.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.188
- Oh, yeah?

34:23.562 --> 34:25.188
- I got to go to the pharmacy.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.606
I'm gonna go now.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.316
Uh, Lane's here.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.316
She'll bring you your root beer.

34:28.358 --> 34:31.069
Hey, Lane, I-I got to run down

34:28.358 --> 34:31.069
to the pharmacy. Got an errand!

34:31.110 --> 34:32.111
(Lane)
