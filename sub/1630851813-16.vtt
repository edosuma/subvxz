WEBVTT

00:10.184 --> 00:11.185
BONHAM:Whoa.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.621
What's going? What is this?

00:12.664 --> 00:14.275
40 years.
We're celebrating.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.625
Is that scarlet sage?

00:16.668 --> 00:17.626
Sure is.

00:17.669 --> 00:18.757
I loved how it grew wild

00:18.801 --> 00:20.020
near the porch at home.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.891
AUGUST:
Where do you think we got it?

00:21.934 --> 00:23.719
Little anniversary trespassing.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.417
He's kidding.
You are, right?

00:26.461 --> 00:29.072
Okay, scooch. I mean,
this all looks beautiful,

00:29.116 --> 00:31.118
but, uh, we're a little
particular about our bacon.

00:31.161 --> 00:34.034
No, Mama, please,
go and relax outside.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.471
We know how Dad
likes bacon.

00:36.514 --> 00:39.039
Why don't we get you
situated outside?

00:39.082 --> 00:40.953
Outside.[overlapping chatter]

00:40.997 --> 00:42.607
BONHAM: Make 'em happy.
Go outside. Come on.Go, the two of you.

00:42.651 --> 00:43.826
Happy anniversary.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.262
Thank you very much.Thanks.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.090
BONHAM: Y'all are the best.ABELINE: It's very sweet.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.439
BONHAM
I guess.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.485
Let's go.
Thank you, Augie.
Thanks.

00:50.528 --> 00:53.314
Is anyone else
getting cold feet?

00:53.357 --> 00:55.185
Mawline seemed a little bit...

00:55.229 --> 00:57.187
Trust me, after all
they've gone through lately...All right. Enjoy.

00:57.231 --> 01:00.016
...getting showered
with love

01:00.060 --> 01:02.366
is exactly what Mama
needs right now.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.281
Uh, let's just go over
the plan again.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.848
Yeah, yeah. I'm-I'm gonna
get the bubbly.[cell phone chimes]

01:05.891 --> 01:07.632
Trey actually told me
about a place here in town

01:07.676 --> 01:09.982
that deals rare wines, so...
He's in Vegas

01:10.026 --> 01:12.550
with his mom, but...

01:12.594 --> 01:13.899
Bubbles?Yes.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.684
Good. Great. Check.
Uh, kids?

01:15.727 --> 01:17.599
Don't ruin the surprise.
Uh, be on time.Mm-hmm.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.036
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, yeah, I think

01:20.080 --> 01:22.038
we got it.And we may have a little

01:22.082 --> 01:23.692
something else planned
for them as well.

01:23.735 --> 01:24.997
Yeah? Awesome.
STELLA: Mm-hmm.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.347
Oh, one more thing, uh,

01:26.390 --> 01:28.000
Cassie wants to tag along today,

01:28.044 --> 01:30.177
so we'll have all hands on deck,
plus one.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.569
Well, she can ride with me.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.789
Love to get a chance to meet
your newest victim.

01:33.832 --> 01:34.703
WALKER:
Great. Let's do it.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.052
Divide and conquer.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.315
Divide and conquer.Divide and conquer.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.796
Yeah.

01:40.839 --> 01:42.972
Hey, Pops. I'm just, uh...

01:43.015 --> 01:45.540
Listen, uh, these windows
aren't double-paned,

01:45.583 --> 01:47.716
and you already can't whisper
worth a damn, son.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.544
Yeah, that-that's...
that's nothing.

01:49.587 --> 01:50.849
Okay, listen,

01:50.893 --> 01:52.590
if you're really
looking for something

01:52.634 --> 01:55.854
to get your mother, there is
one thing that you can do.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.160
Great, sure, anything.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.553
Well...

01:58.596 --> 02:00.729
Abby hasn't been the same
since everything

02:00.772 --> 02:02.252
with Geraldine went down.

02:02.296 --> 02:05.037
You know, we all...

02:05.081 --> 02:06.430
feel the way we
feel about that,

02:06.474 --> 02:10.217
but your mother... [sighs]

02:10.260 --> 02:12.175
Well, hell, the one thing
that'll make this day

02:12.219 --> 02:14.525
really special...

02:14.569 --> 02:16.353
is Geraldine
giving her a chance.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.530
Yes, sir.So, you're working on that?

02:19.574 --> 02:20.662
I will do.
All right.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.407
[door opens]

02:26.450 --> 02:27.712
[Gale sighs]

02:30.280 --> 02:32.630
That was so nice, huh?
Just three of us

02:32.674 --> 02:34.328
getting out of town
for a couple days.

02:34.371 --> 02:35.894
Yeah. Yeah.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.896
I know it was a little tense
with Denise.

02:37.940 --> 02:41.509
I get it. It's-it's a lot
to process.Yeah.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.337
You know, waking up
in your 30s,

02:43.380 --> 02:47.123
learning that you have
a sister and that...

02:47.167 --> 02:48.907
Well, you know.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.779
Yeah. She'll come around.It's... Yeah.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.346
I know that.
Yeah.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.912
I mean, Lord knows I'm

02:53.956 --> 02:57.046
still wrapping my head
around it, but

02:57.089 --> 02:59.440
I am glad that
we're trying.
[sighs]

02:59.483 --> 03:00.789
Me, too.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.357
Well, thank you...
Aw.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.445
...for everything.Of course, of course.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.751
Ah.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.362
Um, hey, you know what, though?

03:08.405 --> 03:09.928
You and I haven't
really had any

03:09.972 --> 03:13.062
mother-daughter time,
just, you know, just one-on-one.

03:13.105 --> 03:16.718
Mother-daughter.
Wow, that's... still so...

03:16.761 --> 03:18.459
[laughs]...so crazy. Um,

03:18.502 --> 03:20.243
Yeah, no, I guess you're right.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.679
Why don't you
come on by tonight?

03:21.723 --> 03:23.812
I'll pull out
some family recipes

03:23.855 --> 03:25.683
and, you know, read you in on
some secrets.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.427
Yeah. I think I'd like that.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.473
All right.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.822
All right. Bye, honey.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.172
Bye.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.827
You really know
your Syrahs.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.352
[sighs] I guess I

03:42.396 --> 03:45.137
just like to think about
the life of wine,

03:45.181 --> 03:46.748
how it's a living thing.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.098
I like
to think about

03:49.141 --> 03:51.535
what was going on

03:51.579 --> 03:54.016
the year the grapes
were growing, and...

03:55.626 --> 03:57.019
Are you really buying this?

03:57.062 --> 03:58.629
Seriously?

03:58.673 --> 04:00.283
There's, like,
one movie about wine,

04:00.327 --> 04:03.243
and you, a wine person,
haven't seen it?

04:03.286 --> 04:05.201
Uh...Oh, come on,
it's Paul Giamatti.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.072
It's a great film.
It's Sideways.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.814
My dad's a real bourbon guy,
so the fact he brings up

04:09.858 --> 04:11.468
this wine that they toasted

04:11.512 --> 04:14.079
every time that he talks
about their wedding...

04:14.123 --> 04:15.429
I mean, it must be special.

04:15.472 --> 04:16.865
That or

04:16.908 --> 04:18.867
just because it gives my mom
the giggles.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.912
[laughs]
I...

04:20.956 --> 04:23.741
Oh, the Chalamet Esprit Brut
Vintage '82.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.962
Bottle that nice would give
anybody the giggles.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.094
It's a wonderful gift,
if you can find it.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.880
[chuckles] So... can you get it?

04:31.923 --> 04:34.056
For you, I'll see what I can do.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.014
I'll say this,

04:36.058 --> 04:37.625
they're lucky to have
a son like you.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.279
Well...

04:39.322 --> 04:42.543
I'll place some calls
with local collectors.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.633
If you'll leave me
your info...
Yeah.

04:45.676 --> 04:46.938
Uh, William.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.245
Well, Liam.
Everybody calls me Liam.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.247
Um, but, I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.466
[chuckles] Yeah.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.250
Ben.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.730
Cass.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.514
You two know each other.

04:57.558 --> 05:00.169
I-I didn't realize
you worked here.

05:00.212 --> 05:03.172
Clearly, given that you're here.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.305
LIAM: Oh.
You two know each other

05:05.348 --> 05:07.307
in-in a not great way.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.047
I just wasn't sure where you...

05:09.091 --> 05:11.485
No, of course.
The city's chock-full

05:11.528 --> 05:13.095
of specialty
wine and spirit shops.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.836
[chuckles]
I mean, it kind of is.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.272
BEN:
I'm sorry.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.100
I'm late for my
lunch break. Um...

05:18.143 --> 05:19.710
My colleague
will help you.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.277
LIAM:
Yeah, I...

05:21.321 --> 05:22.626
[sighs]

05:22.670 --> 05:24.193
Okay.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.978
What the hell
was that?

05:27.022 --> 05:30.504
That was everyone's
favorite Perez.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.070
My brother.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.423
â™ª

05:47.434 --> 05:48.391
[burps]

05:48.435 --> 05:50.088
Oh.

05:50.132 --> 05:51.133
You're gross.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.091
Speaking of gross.
How's the drama?

05:53.135 --> 05:54.658
I'm sorry, the what?

05:54.702 --> 05:56.704
Oh, you know, that little
love triangle you seem to find

05:56.747 --> 05:58.096
yourself in that,
you know, threatens

05:58.140 --> 05:59.707
to destroy not only my band,

05:59.750 --> 06:01.491
but, like, the only
real guy friends

06:01.535 --> 06:03.014
I've had in a while.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.407
Not to make it
about me or anything.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.453
Yeah, definitely
not making it about you.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.413
But I think I've had
a breakthrough,

06:10.457 --> 06:12.328
and not just about boys.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.331
I'm at a fork in the road
in a lot of ways.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.724
You'll get it
when you're a senior.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.290
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.335
All this stuff

06:19.379 --> 06:20.771
for Gramps and Mawline,

06:20.815 --> 06:22.599
everything that they've
been through.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.862
Yeah, horse races,
murder charges.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.690
We're here because
of a turning point.

06:26.734 --> 06:27.996
Think about it.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.606
On what was maybe

06:29.650 --> 06:32.043
one of the most interesting
nights of Mawline's life,

06:32.087 --> 06:35.133
just as she was celebrating
her engagement to Marv,

06:35.177 --> 06:37.658
she met Gramps,
and everything changed.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.224
Okay?

06:39.268 --> 06:41.270
Okay, so...

06:41.313 --> 06:43.968
Todd or Colton
or "choosing myself."

06:44.012 --> 06:46.536
Am I staying here or going
to freaking Oregon for college?

06:46.580 --> 06:47.711
All I'm saying

06:47.755 --> 06:49.931
is fate, like, butted in

06:49.974 --> 06:52.194
and basically pointed the way
for Mawline,

06:52.237 --> 06:54.022
and 40 years later,

06:54.065 --> 06:55.284
here we are.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.590
Something happened that night,

06:56.633 --> 06:58.505
and Mawline listened.

06:58.548 --> 07:01.595
So, I'm just gonna wait
for a sign to guide me.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.773
What?

07:05.816 --> 07:07.601
Oh, nothing. I was gonna burp,

07:07.644 --> 07:09.167
but it feels like you were
saying something important,

07:09.211 --> 07:10.255
so I refrained.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.823
[chuckles]

07:12.867 --> 07:14.912
[hammering]

07:16.740 --> 07:18.742
[chuckles] Hey!

07:18.786 --> 07:20.091
Check it out.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.702
What do you think?CASSIE: Wow.

07:21.745 --> 07:24.008
It's, uh, subtle,
understated.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.227
I love it.
Yeah.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.534
I'm glad that someone's
making progress.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.492
Hey, uh, you get
that champagne?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.929
Uh, we ran into a little issue.

07:31.973 --> 07:35.063
[chuckles] He's being nice.
We didn't get it.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.065
We had a...
Okay.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.980
...little run-in
with my big brother

07:39.023 --> 07:41.373
which sent the
whole thing, well,

07:41.417 --> 07:42.549
sideways,

07:42.592 --> 07:43.811
which is a movie

07:43.854 --> 07:45.943
any so-called wine person
should've seen.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.858
Uh, hold on a second.
Let's back it up.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.774
You have a brother?
And he lives in Austin?

07:50.818 --> 07:53.516
Uh, how am I just
finding this out?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.431
Well, you know what,
didn't really come up

07:55.475 --> 07:56.867
between the, "Hey, get in
the trunk,"

07:56.911 --> 07:58.565
and the, "Oh, no, I've made
a traumatic discovery

07:58.608 --> 08:00.523
about my partner," so...

08:00.567 --> 08:02.482
But, yes, I do.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.875
I'm gathering that you two
aren't really close?

08:04.919 --> 08:06.921
LIAM: Cordi, can I actually
pick your brain

08:06.964 --> 08:08.575
just for a second?Yeah.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.925
Alone. Uh...
about the banner.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.404
About the...Um...

08:12.448 --> 08:13.493
What's wrong
with the banner?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.233
I-I saw
what went down

08:15.277 --> 08:17.801
between her
and her brother

08:17.845 --> 08:18.976
today, and
I think what

08:19.020 --> 08:20.151
she may need
is a little less

08:20.195 --> 08:22.937
boom, smash, overshare,

08:22.980 --> 08:24.242
and a little more gentle.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.549
[laughs] Thanks, Liam,
'cause, mm,

08:26.593 --> 08:27.855
that sounded
a little bit like a jab.

08:27.898 --> 08:28.986
It's not a...
[clears throat]

08:29.030 --> 08:30.684
Divide and conquer,

08:30.727 --> 08:32.207
remember?

08:32.250 --> 08:33.948
How are things going
with the whole

08:33.991 --> 08:35.515
reuniting of Mom and Geri?

08:35.558 --> 08:36.951
It's delicate
right now, you know.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.431
I called her earlier.
Haven't heard back,

08:39.475 --> 08:41.303
but, uh...

08:41.346 --> 08:43.740
Yeah. You know what, why don't,
why don't you let me take over

08:43.784 --> 08:46.874
things here for just
a little bit?

08:46.917 --> 08:49.224
You know?

08:49.267 --> 08:51.008
Yeah. Thanks.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.054
I'll, uh, you know,
I'll check back in with Ger.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.796
Okay.Uh, don't touch my banner.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.275
I'm not gonna...

08:57.319 --> 08:59.321
touch the banner.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.888
You know, your dad
should really bring

09:00.931 --> 09:02.454
the porn 'stache back.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.327
No. No. Um...Yes. [growls]

09:05.370 --> 09:08.635
Look, I, uh,
I don't mean to pry.

09:08.678 --> 09:11.028
Okay? And you just say the word,
I'll drop it completely.

09:11.072 --> 09:14.162
I don't know what happened
between you and your brother

09:14.205 --> 09:16.381
Ben, but I do know

09:16.425 --> 09:19.515
about brothers and trauma.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.606
Um, we were always close.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.086
Like, uh,

09:25.129 --> 09:28.132
"matching sweaters
at Christmas by choice"

09:28.176 --> 09:30.047
close.
Mm-hmm.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.790
And then...

09:33.834 --> 09:35.792
things happened.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.751
[inhales]

09:37.794 --> 09:39.753
Well, like you said,

09:39.796 --> 09:41.929
you-you have a brother.
You get it.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.626
I don't know
what things happened,

09:43.670 --> 09:45.759
or how Miles figures
into any of this,

09:45.802 --> 09:47.674
but what I can say is

09:47.717 --> 09:50.459
that when Emily died,

09:50.502 --> 09:52.722
I mean, Cordi disappeared.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.898
I mean, he was gone
gone, you know,

09:54.942 --> 09:57.553
and I went to him
when he was undercover,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.686
just to try and
get real with him

09:59.729 --> 10:01.383
'cause I was afraid
he-he would never come home.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.994
There was just this
world of hurt between us

10:04.038 --> 10:07.694
that would've
torn us apart, and...

10:07.737 --> 10:09.652
I may be totally off base,

10:09.696 --> 10:12.176
but I felt some of that

10:12.220 --> 10:14.178
with you two today.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.180
[sighs] Yeah.

10:16.224 --> 10:19.401
I just don't know what step
I'm supposed to take.

10:19.444 --> 10:22.099
I don't want to oversimplify it,
but, I mean, maybe just

10:22.143 --> 10:25.233
put one foot in front
of the other, you know?

10:25.276 --> 10:26.887
Repeat as necessary.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.585
See where that road
takes you.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.240
It's got to be a lot better than
where you two are right now.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.898
So, we ditching
homeroom or...[laughing]

10:37.941 --> 10:39.203
...got a big game,
varsity?

10:39.247 --> 10:41.815
No, no, I-I just
wanted to, uh,

10:41.858 --> 10:43.599
copy your and
Em's homework

10:43.643 --> 10:45.470
under the bleachers
before biology.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.472
Oh, memories.

10:47.516 --> 10:48.473
Yeah, that's kind of

10:48.517 --> 10:49.866
why I wanted to

10:49.910 --> 10:52.347
see you here.
Memories, you know?

10:52.390 --> 10:53.348
Simpler times.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.698
Uh...

10:55.742 --> 10:57.047
At the Kansas show,

10:57.091 --> 10:58.483
I didn't mean to step
in between you

10:58.527 --> 11:00.529
and-and your new-- you...

11:00.572 --> 11:02.574
I didn't mean to step
in between you and Gale.[cell phone ringing]

11:02.618 --> 11:04.794
But I did. Sorry.No, it's-it's fine.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.709
Why don't you...
Might be work, so...No, no, no. I-I-I

11:06.753 --> 11:08.668
feel terrible about
the way I acted.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.234
And I know
that-that's not

11:10.278 --> 11:13.585
the reason we're-we're
not... you know, together,

11:13.629 --> 11:15.849
but I-I-I needed
to-to-to own up to it,

11:15.892 --> 11:19.069
and I need
to make it...

11:19.113 --> 11:20.070
right.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.594
Um...

11:22.638 --> 11:23.987
Geri,

11:24.031 --> 11:26.947
I-I'm gonna show you
that I'm committed to

11:26.990 --> 11:29.166
our friendship

11:29.210 --> 11:31.734
because that's still there,
always will be.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.868
I know that.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.608
So, you-your big ask?

11:36.652 --> 11:38.045
[cell phone ringing]You-you...

11:38.088 --> 11:39.350
I mean, you texted me...Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.744
Uh, sorry, um,
it-it's-it's not for me,

11:41.788 --> 11:43.224
it's-it's for,
it's for my folks.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.748
Uh, so we're throwing
them a surprise

11:45.792 --> 11:47.532
get-together
at The Side Step tonight

11:47.576 --> 11:50.187
for their 40th anniversary.40?

11:50.231 --> 11:52.755
Wow, feels like
they just turned 40.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.975
[laughs] I know,
I know, right? Um...

11:55.018 --> 11:57.238
Thing is, um...

11:57.281 --> 11:59.762
And I hate

11:59.806 --> 12:03.461
putting you
in this position, but...

12:03.505 --> 12:05.899
Thing is, there's gonna be
a dark cloud over Mama

12:05.942 --> 12:07.291
all night if you're not there,

12:07.335 --> 12:09.772
you know?

12:09.816 --> 12:11.818
Cordi... [sighs]

12:11.861 --> 12:13.558
It's not that simple.Geri,

12:13.602 --> 12:15.735
is there anything I can do

12:15.778 --> 12:16.997
to help? Anything?Can you square

12:17.040 --> 12:19.956
the fact that the father I love

12:20.000 --> 12:23.177
killed the man who brought me
into this world only to

12:23.220 --> 12:25.962
throw me out like trash?
[chuckles]

12:26.006 --> 12:28.095
Or-or maybe go back
so that your mom

12:28.138 --> 12:30.184
didn't sit
on that secret?

12:30.227 --> 12:31.925
And, again,

12:31.968 --> 12:33.665
I understand,

12:33.709 --> 12:35.319
but...

12:35.363 --> 12:37.800
I can't undo

12:37.844 --> 12:40.150
how it makes me feel.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.196
Yeah, yeah, I-I get that.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.545
I do. Um...

12:43.588 --> 12:46.417
Just consider it
for them, please.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.508
I will consider it.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.380
Thanks.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.557
For them and you, okay?Yup.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.127
Okay. I'll see you later.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.738
See you.[cell phone ringing]

13:07.569 --> 13:09.614
Walker.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.573
Wait, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.096
Wait, Twyla... what?

13:16.099 --> 13:18.406
Okay, uh... Hang tight.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.190
I'm on my way.

13:31.506 --> 13:34.248
You're saying $800
just happened to disappear

13:34.291 --> 13:35.771
on your first day?TWYLA: Exactly.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.990
It's my first day.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.382
I know how to hide a con
better than that.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.036
Hey, uh,
Ranger Cordell Walker.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.690
Um, I'm here. Officer.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.040
Uh, I'm...
What's going on?

13:44.084 --> 13:45.563
[scoffs] I'll tell you
what's going on,

13:45.607 --> 13:47.783
she thought she could
take me for a ride.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.177
Thought I wouldn't notice
her misdirecting

13:50.220 --> 13:52.919
electronic funds transfers
right under my nose.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.051
Oh, if I took you for a ride,
you'd know it, buddy.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.400
Okay, okay,
Twyla, cool it.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.793
Cool it.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.621
BOSS: There's nothing left
to solve here. A criminal

13:59.664 --> 14:01.710
with prior felony
theft convictions

14:01.753 --> 14:03.190
thought she'd
try it again,

14:03.233 --> 14:04.800
but not today.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.890
Take her away.Nah, no, no. Not so fast.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.892
[phone chimes]No one is putting Twyla
behind bars

14:09.936 --> 14:11.198
without her getting
a fair shake,

14:11.241 --> 14:12.895
you understand that?

14:12.939 --> 14:15.289
H-Hold on a second, okay?
Just, um...

14:16.681 --> 14:18.901
Everybody just hang tight

14:18.945 --> 14:21.295
for a minute, okay?
I have to address this.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.909
[cell phone ringing]Mm.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.476
What up, stinker?

14:28.519 --> 14:30.347
You texted me SOS. What's up?

14:30.391 --> 14:34.395
Yeah, the berries
are clogged in the dispenser

14:34.438 --> 14:35.918
for my Bourbon
Blackberry Collins.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.616
You don't text "SOS"
over a-a bourbon...

14:38.660 --> 14:40.053
[stammers] What?

14:40.096 --> 14:41.924
The signature cocktail
that I'm...

14:41.968 --> 14:44.796
I made just in case
we can't get the champagne.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.668
I don't really have time
for this right now, Liam.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.713
Uh... [stammers]
I'm trying to keep Twyla

14:48.757 --> 14:50.324
out of jail, so...

14:50.367 --> 14:53.283
Twyla? You're with Twyla
right now? Second time

14:53.327 --> 14:54.763
in one week.
Hey, you better pray

14:54.806 --> 14:57.157
that Mom and Dad or Geri
don't catch wind of this.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.288
Don't start, all right?

14:58.332 --> 14:59.333
I'm just doing my job.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.725
Hey, I'm serious about Geri.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.597
This is not a good way
to make peace.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.033
Does she know
that you're with Twyla?

15:04.077 --> 15:06.079
There's nothing to know, Liam.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.559
A-And Geri and I a-aren't even,

15:08.603 --> 15:10.039
like... [stammers]Yeah, I know, I know,

15:10.083 --> 15:12.868
but Twyla equals Rodeo Kings.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.262
She was all over
the news cycle, and I-I know

15:15.305 --> 15:16.872
that she had nothing to do
with Hoyt's death

15:16.916 --> 15:18.918
and that whole nightmare, but...

15:18.961 --> 15:20.267
I don't think that Geri's

15:20.310 --> 15:21.659
gonna be able
to make that distinction.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.400
Liam, I got this.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.929
Secret to brisket
is to get a good sear

15:29.972 --> 15:31.234
before it slow roasts.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.496
You're gonna school me
on brisket?

15:32.540 --> 15:33.889
Well...I've been searing

15:33.933 --> 15:35.195
your brisket for months now.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.979
Mm.
What?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.459
What I want to know

15:38.502 --> 15:41.157
is the spice ratio
in that chili of yours.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.029
I-I nearly forgot,

15:43.072 --> 15:46.075
you're the one who's been
prepping and-and-and serving

15:46.119 --> 15:48.251
at The Side Step
this whole time. Wow.
Mm-hmm.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.471
Well, I guess this,
uh, chili has been

15:50.514 --> 15:52.908
in family hands this whole time.
Imagine that.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.432
Hadn't thought
about it that way.Yeah. Mm-hmm.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.999
Mm. Okay,

15:57.043 --> 15:59.001
you get the spices
I'll get the pot,

15:59.045 --> 16:01.047
and, uh, we'll swap secrets,
all right?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.005
Okay.
Okay.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.789
Here we go. Whew.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.357
Let's go with this one.Oh. They used to...

16:07.401 --> 16:08.532
I moved them.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.969
Here we go.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.014
Right here.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.277
[sighs] Mm...

16:14.321 --> 16:16.323
So, I'll get this one.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.281
Oregano.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.761
You okay, sweetheart?Yeah,

16:19.804 --> 16:21.589
no, I think it's just...

16:21.632 --> 16:23.243
being in this kitchen.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.809
Everything's...
Yeah.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.507
...so different.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.118
Yeah.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.555
A-And it's-it's

16:31.599 --> 16:33.427
Abeline and-and Bonham's

16:33.470 --> 16:34.819
40th anniversary.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.952
[gasps] Oh...And they're celebrating

16:36.996 --> 16:38.214
tonight.
Okay.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.695
They asked me
to be there, so...

16:40.738 --> 16:43.698
All right, well,
I'm-I'm glad you said so.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.830
Uh, look, I-I understand

16:45.874 --> 16:48.007
you have a history
with Bonham and Abby,

16:48.050 --> 16:50.139
of course I do,

16:50.183 --> 16:52.707
and after all the losses
they've been through,

16:52.750 --> 16:54.926
I'd expect they need you
there tonight.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.450
So you should go.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.973
Yeah, you g--
you got my blessing,

16:58.017 --> 16:59.888
not-not that you need it,
of course.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.978
Look, um...

17:03.022 --> 17:06.329
I can't say why Abeline
stayed silent all those years,

17:06.373 --> 17:08.853
but what I can say is

17:08.897 --> 17:11.726
Marv saddled her
with an impossible choice.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.251
Don't let him do
the same thing to you.

17:17.645 --> 17:21.083
Okay, thank you.
Uh... Well, good news,

17:21.127 --> 17:22.737
Mr. O'Brien...
[clears throat]

17:22.780 --> 17:24.391
our financial forensics

17:24.434 --> 17:27.481
tracked down that, uh,
$800 in misallocated EFTs.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.439
Mm-hmm.
Bad news,

17:29.483 --> 17:31.746
looks like it was
your clerical error.What?

17:31.789 --> 17:33.487
[sighs] Regardless,
you can't

17:33.530 --> 17:34.836
blame me for looking
at her record

17:34.879 --> 17:36.142
and coming to the conclusion...

17:36.185 --> 17:37.273
Oh, I can, and I am.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.405
Your oversight

17:38.448 --> 17:40.102
could've upended
her life.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.191
All I need to know
is that she...

17:42.235 --> 17:44.106
WALKER: Is that she's trying
to turn her life around.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.629
That she's
a STEM grant recipient

17:45.673 --> 17:47.718
who took a job
to make ends meet.

17:47.762 --> 17:50.678
Do you think she worked all
those years to-to case a bank?

17:50.721 --> 17:52.984
Twyla trusted

17:53.028 --> 17:56.205
the wrong guy, and it
backfired and snowballed.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.554
She's paid
for it already.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.557
She doesn't need to pay
for the rest of her life.

18:00.601 --> 18:03.125
I'll check in
with you tomorrow.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.214
Okay.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.959
[door opens]

18:13.875 --> 18:14.876
[sighs]

18:14.919 --> 18:16.007
[exhales]

18:18.836 --> 18:21.100
Two Perezes, one Austin.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.798
This town
ain't weird enough

18:23.841 --> 18:25.887
for the both of us.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.674
Look, Mom made it sound like
you hadn't put down roots yet.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.504
Well, I wasn't gonna
stay in Houston

18:34.548 --> 18:36.332
after Lucas.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.423
Oh, you're still here?

18:40.467 --> 18:42.730
Figured you would've run
at the mention of his name.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.473
All right, okay.
Well, I deserve that.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.039
[sighs]

18:48.083 --> 18:49.824
Look, I'm trying
to fix this.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.348
Just let me explain
what happened.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.176
I know what happened.
I was there.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.483
I watched my boyfriend die.
Where the hell were you?

18:56.526 --> 18:58.963
I was trying to...

18:59.007 --> 19:00.835
Pretend nothing was happening?

19:03.185 --> 19:05.187
Um... [groans]

19:05.231 --> 19:07.711
Okay, right, okay. Um...

19:07.755 --> 19:10.801
Let's just stick to the
champagne my friend asked about,

19:10.845 --> 19:12.629
okay? Did you get it?

19:14.065 --> 19:15.415
His family
needs my help.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.633
Oh, his family?

19:16.677 --> 19:18.461
Wow, how selfless,
Cass.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.984
What a friend.
I'm sure everything

19:20.028 --> 19:21.377
will go great for them
with you in their corner.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.597
You know what...No, I don't.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.427
Oh, is this when you
send a postcard?

19:31.039 --> 19:33.172
He asked about you,
you know.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.653
Near the end,
he asked about you.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.961
I never really knew
what to say.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.528
Lucky for you,
he was so far gone

19:41.571 --> 19:43.138
he never really
knew the truth.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.852
You're okay, you're okay.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.941
[crying]

20:05.116 --> 20:06.335
Uh...

20:08.642 --> 20:09.686
[grunts]

20:22.656 --> 20:25.615
My goodness, you look as
beautiful as the day we met.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.838
You know, everything's gonna be
all right in time,

20:30.881 --> 20:33.493
so let's just

20:33.536 --> 20:35.146
enjoy the night.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.452
I know.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.543
What do you think
they got planned for us?

20:40.587 --> 20:43.154
Viking funeral.
[laughs]

20:43.198 --> 20:44.852
So be it.

20:44.895 --> 20:47.420
As long as I sail out
with you.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.160
[chuckles]

20:55.123 --> 20:57.734
Dad seemed super bummed
to miss dinner tonight,

20:57.778 --> 20:59.562
but he had a ton
of work stuff.

20:59.606 --> 21:03.436
Anyways, it should be fun with
just us and Uncle Liam, right?

21:03.479 --> 21:04.654
Of course it will.
Won't it, hon?

21:04.698 --> 21:05.960
ABELINE:Oh, yes.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.396
Oh, crap. Hey, guys,
I just got a text

21:07.440 --> 21:09.311
that, uh,
Uncle Liam's stuck

21:09.355 --> 21:10.660
in traffic.
He said he won't be able

21:10.704 --> 21:12.314
to make dinner either.Oh.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.576
Oh, what a shame.

21:13.620 --> 21:14.664
[sighs]ABELINE: You know,

21:14.708 --> 21:16.057
since it's just
the four of us,

21:16.100 --> 21:18.059
why don't we just swing by
a-a food truck?

21:18.102 --> 21:19.321
Oh, I'm craving
Patrizi's.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.583
Oh, Patrizi's.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.063
Yeah, that'd
hit the spot.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.848
Oh, um,
I'm gluten-free now,

21:24.892 --> 21:26.589
so Italian
really might not be

21:26.633 --> 21:29.026
the best...
BONHAM: Oh, well,
you know, tacos

21:29.070 --> 21:30.680
is always a good anniversary
meal, isn't it?

21:30.724 --> 21:32.029
Well, you know,
a-and-and

21:32.073 --> 21:34.205
Rosarito's
has got corn tortillas.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.946
I left my prescription
at the bar.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.383
Oh!Why would you leave
your prescription?

21:37.426 --> 21:39.559
I didn't know you took
a prescription.
Yeah, no,

21:39.602 --> 21:40.603
it's-it's
really vital.

21:40.647 --> 21:41.822
I just forget
the name of it. Um...

21:41.865 --> 21:43.911
It's at The Side Step,
so let's go to the...

21:43.954 --> 21:45.478
uh, Side Step.Well, we're right here,

21:45.521 --> 21:47.393
so it's no problem,
Augie. [chuckles]

21:47.436 --> 21:49.743
We might as well
just all go inside.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.310
ABELINE:
Well, we could stay in the car.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.876
AUGUST:
[stammers] Let's go inside.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.096
STELLA: I don't think
that's a great idea. Yeah.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.056
CROWD:
Surprise!

21:59.100 --> 22:00.275
[cheering]

22:00.319 --> 22:03.496
Thank you. Hey...

22:03.539 --> 22:05.976
Hey, you, too.
What's going on?

22:07.282 --> 22:09.458
[Abeline laughs]

22:11.634 --> 22:14.245
Happy anniversary, Daddy, Mama.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.682
LIAM:We're so proud to
have you as parents.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.379
We love you so much.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.338
WALKER: Mama. All right, come
on. Yeah, yeah. Bring it in.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.643
Hey. Big hug.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.689
[cheering, applause]

22:24.255 --> 22:27.258
All right, all right.
Eat, drink, be merry.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.303
Open bar.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.652
[cheering, applause]

22:29.696 --> 22:31.567
Whoa, that's a good sign.
How's it going?

22:31.611 --> 22:34.962
Uh, hey, Lou, can I get another
Bourbon Blackberry Collins?

22:35.005 --> 22:36.006
Gotcha.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.400
Thanks.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.923
I got what you were looking for.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.230
Hey.

22:42.273 --> 22:47.191
Uh... Chalamet Esprit Brut
Vintage '82.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.411
A real champagne
in the ass to find

22:49.455 --> 22:51.500
but I finally found it for you.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.808
Wait, a minute, I called
every single wine distributor

22:54.851 --> 22:56.026
in the state of Texas.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.768
How did you get this?

22:58.812 --> 23:00.379
A long story for another day.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.120
I just hope it brings
your folks some joy.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.645
Or, uh, at least a good buzz.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.473
[both chuckle]

23:07.516 --> 23:09.431
Okay, well, thank you.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.651
Thank you. Uh...

23:11.694 --> 23:14.001
Hey, why don't you stick around?

23:14.044 --> 23:16.003
Night's just, uh,
getting started.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.224
Twist my arm.
[chuckles]

23:20.268 --> 23:22.488
LOU:
We're almost out, Liam.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.490
The drink is a hit.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.187
Thank you, Lou.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.277
Um, you know what?

23:29.320 --> 23:32.019
You're a booze expert.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.891
What do you think about this
Bourbon Blackberry Collins?

23:39.330 --> 23:41.811
Mm?

23:41.855 --> 23:43.465
It's a revelation.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.380
This Bourbon Blackberry Collins

23:45.424 --> 23:46.816
changed my life.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.732
Are you pandering
because I made it?

23:49.776 --> 23:51.995
Wait, you crafted this cocktail?

23:52.039 --> 23:53.388
I can't tell if
you're messing with...

23:53.432 --> 23:55.434
No, had I known that you were

23:55.477 --> 23:58.132
the visionary mixologist
of this resplendent...

23:58.175 --> 23:59.699
Okay, I know you're
messing with me.

23:59.742 --> 24:02.615
No, no, no, it's good.
It really is.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.188
It's just a bit acidic.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.498
[tapping on glass]Excuse me.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.152
Folks, folks.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.762
Excuse me.
Thank you, sorry.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.503
I-I wanted to, uh, say,

24:21.547 --> 24:25.638
uh-- I wanted to thank all y'all
for coming out tonight

24:25.681 --> 24:29.032
and, uh, I'd like
to raise a glass

24:29.076 --> 24:32.427
to the beautiful couple
we are all here to celebrate.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.125
[cheering]I-I hear you. I--
My sentiments exactly.

24:35.169 --> 24:38.389
Uh, as lucky as these two are
to have found each other,

24:38.433 --> 24:41.654
I wonder if Liam and I

24:41.697 --> 24:44.047
and my son and daughter

24:44.091 --> 24:48.661
aren't actually
the luckiest people in here,

24:48.704 --> 24:51.359
because we got to have them
as parents,

24:51.402 --> 24:54.580
as-as grandparents.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.712
And we all know
how generous they are

24:56.756 --> 24:59.410
with their love and friendship.

24:59.454 --> 25:00.803
Uh, hear, hear.

25:00.847 --> 25:03.110
[cheering, applause]

25:10.639 --> 25:12.641
ABELINE: Thank you, son.Yeah, just wanted to do

25:12.685 --> 25:13.816
something special
for you tonight.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.557
Um, you know, all the family's

25:15.601 --> 25:17.254
gone through, lately,
a lot of losses, with the ranch

25:17.298 --> 25:19.430
and uprooting the family...Uprooting?

25:19.474 --> 25:21.345
Yeah.Our family, our marriage,

25:21.389 --> 25:23.522
it's-it's not a ranch, son.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.915
Tonight, I'm
remembering...

25:25.959 --> 25:28.352
Hmm. Hmm...Uh-oh.

25:28.396 --> 25:31.181
Uh-oh. [stammers][laughter]

25:31.225 --> 25:32.835
Marriage

25:32.879 --> 25:35.098
is something you grow.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.274
And something we grow.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.972
Through the dark
and murky

25:39.015 --> 25:42.105
and through the daybreak.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.368
It's us.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.935
It's always us.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.199
And it's all of us.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.724
You know, we, um...
[chuckles]

25:51.767 --> 25:53.377
40 years ago,
it was fate we met.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.597
BONHAM:
You know, it could be

25:55.641 --> 25:56.990
that I followed her
to the Driskill.

25:57.033 --> 25:57.991
[laughter]

25:58.034 --> 25:59.775
ABELINE:
What?

25:59.819 --> 26:01.951
Stop it.
No, he did not.

26:01.995 --> 26:05.651
Listen, it was fate we met.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.131
But we choose
each other every day.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.439
And 40 years ago,

26:11.482 --> 26:12.962
we planted a promise...

26:15.486 --> 26:19.665
...that grew with everyone

26:19.708 --> 26:21.841
we welcomed into our family.

26:21.884 --> 26:25.584
Everyone we loved
along the way.

26:25.627 --> 26:29.152
So when I look out
at all of you,

26:29.196 --> 26:33.548
I do not see a family uprooted.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.507
I see a family thriving.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.335
â™ª I'm-a wait, I'm-a wait

26:38.379 --> 26:40.642
â™ª I'm-a wait for you

26:40.686 --> 26:42.644
â™ª Wait for you, wait for you

26:42.688 --> 26:44.298
â™ª Wait for you

26:44.341 --> 26:47.170
â™ª Wait for you,
wait for you... â™ª

26:47.214 --> 26:49.085
To this thriving family.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.087
To this thriving family.[cheering]

26:54.482 --> 26:58.225
â™ª I'm-a wait for you,
I'm-a, I'm-a wait for you. â™ª

27:04.753 --> 27:06.276
â™ª

27:06.320 --> 27:07.974
You know, all this mushiness
hits a little different

27:08.017 --> 27:09.323
when you just got dumped.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.194
Time will heal, brother.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.979
Yeah, I guess it wasn't
so much about fate

27:13.022 --> 27:14.633
for them after all, huh?

27:15.677 --> 27:17.636
Yeah.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.028
You know,

27:19.072 --> 27:21.814
I don't know what
the future holds,

27:21.857 --> 27:25.687
but like Mawline said, the
universe gave me options.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.081
But I have to choose.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.561
Todd or Colton,

27:30.605 --> 27:32.563
or whether my next chapter
starts here

27:32.607 --> 27:35.697
or across the country.

27:35.741 --> 27:39.396
I might not have
an answer yet, but...

27:39.440 --> 27:43.749
I just hope to one day have
what Mawline and Gramps have.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.142
You will.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.579
I think you will, too.

27:48.623 --> 27:49.580
Thanks.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.147
You know, once you leave

27:51.191 --> 27:53.062
the whole gulp and burp thing
behind.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.282
All right, you're just
ruining the moment, Stella.Okay.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.632
It's just fun, you know?
Hey, thanks again.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.068
Of course.

27:59.112 --> 28:01.375
["Got the Lonely"
by Mel Parsons playing]

28:01.418 --> 28:03.551
[indistinct chatter]

28:17.347 --> 28:18.914
Hey, you know,
anybody could've brought

28:18.958 --> 28:20.655
that bottle of champagne.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.179
I don't think
your brother

28:23.223 --> 28:26.356
is sticking around
for my mixology skills, so...

28:26.400 --> 28:28.968
â™ª I got the lonely...

28:29.011 --> 28:30.491
Fine.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.537
â™ª I got the lonely...

28:33.581 --> 28:36.497
Yeah, um, over here.Okay.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.500
â™ª I got the lonely

28:39.543 --> 28:42.808
â™ª Birds in town

28:42.851 --> 28:44.157
Hey.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.728
Um...

28:49.771 --> 28:50.903
Thank you,

28:50.946 --> 28:52.165
for helping them out.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.733
Heard they needed a win.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.212
Hmm.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.782
I-I screwed up.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.523
Earlier today.

29:02.566 --> 29:06.396
Well, for months, really.
I, uh, I couldn't reach out.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.921
Uh, something
stopped me.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.314
It was pride, guilt.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.753
Couldn't
really admit it

29:14.796 --> 29:17.146
to myself earlier, but

29:17.190 --> 29:19.714
when I ran into you today and...

29:20.846 --> 29:21.977
...and Liam made me take

29:22.021 --> 29:23.413
a harder look at what I did...

29:23.457 --> 29:26.329
Cass.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.678
Talk to me.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.859
Look, when you called
about Lucas,

29:33.902 --> 29:35.686
I don't know
what I was expecting,

29:35.730 --> 29:37.732
but I certainly
wasn't expecting...

29:37.776 --> 29:40.300
Huntington's. Hospice.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.390
We all knew
it was coming.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.827
All of us.
We were prepared and...

29:45.871 --> 29:48.395
No, but-- No, I wasn't.

29:48.438 --> 29:51.746
Okay? And that's the thing.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.748
I loved him, too, Ben.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.404
And I couldn't accept it.

29:57.447 --> 30:00.450
And then, boom,
Miles disappeared and...

30:00.494 --> 30:02.975
Uh-- Y-You're
seriously comparing

30:03.018 --> 30:04.672
my boyfriend of nearly a decade

30:04.715 --> 30:06.630
to some partner
you were assigned, like, what?

30:06.674 --> 30:07.849
Six months ago?No, no, no, no.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.243
I-- I mean, I didn't mean to.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.116
Look, I, um...

30:14.160 --> 30:16.771
I saw you and...

30:16.815 --> 30:20.166
how you were handling
Lucas's fate with grace.

30:20.209 --> 30:24.823
And I was just...
[scoffs]

30:24.866 --> 30:27.913
...I was bumbling.

30:27.956 --> 30:31.917
And then Miles went missing,

30:31.960 --> 30:34.354
and I lost myself in it...

30:36.225 --> 30:39.576
...because it felt like
something I could possibly fix.

30:41.709 --> 30:45.365
Because I couldn't fix Lucas.

30:45.408 --> 30:49.848
So your answer to that was
sending cards and, uh, catering?

30:49.891 --> 30:54.026
I thought I was helping,
by giving you space.

30:54.069 --> 30:56.115
At least, that's what
I told myself.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.117
But I was really
just avoiding...

31:00.032 --> 31:04.340
...his... his Huntington's.

31:06.342 --> 31:09.563
Lucas dying.

31:09.606 --> 31:13.219
I thought if
I could find Miles,

31:13.262 --> 31:17.353
I could protect myself
from more loss.

31:17.397 --> 31:20.922
[laughing]:
And it's ridiculous, I know.

31:24.360 --> 31:28.930
And, oh, he's gone, too,
and I hurt you.

31:28.974 --> 31:32.020
And I am so sorry, Benny.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.895
[crying]

31:43.640 --> 31:44.946
LIAM:
Uh, excuse me.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.079
Everybody, can I have
your attention?

31:47.122 --> 31:49.864
So, Daddy, you always
mentioned this,

31:49.908 --> 31:53.172
uh, every time you talked about
the wedding, so I figured

31:53.215 --> 31:55.217
it meant something special.BONHAM:
It does.

31:55.261 --> 31:58.003
And it means a lot, son.
Thank you.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.961
Thank you, Daddy. Um...

32:00.005 --> 32:03.704
on their wedding night,
my mom and dad

32:03.747 --> 32:06.011
said "I do," and they sealed it

32:06.054 --> 32:09.797
with a kiss and a toast.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.538
And so, 40 years later,

32:11.581 --> 32:13.844
we go back to that same vine.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.498
Everybody stand back.Oh...

32:15.542 --> 32:18.588
Here we go, all right?[laughter]

32:19.589 --> 32:21.287
[cheering, applause]

32:23.419 --> 32:24.594
BONHAM:
Thank you so much.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.248
All right, so...

32:26.292 --> 32:28.381
I would like to...Oops.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.993
propose a toast
to my mom and dad...

32:32.037 --> 32:33.603
BONHAM:I'm gonna stop you
right there, son.

32:33.647 --> 32:34.778
I know you got

32:34.822 --> 32:37.390
some beautiful things prepared,
but I...

32:37.433 --> 32:39.131
There's just,
there's a little thing I--

32:39.174 --> 32:40.219
something I want to do.

32:40.262 --> 32:41.437
All right?LIAM: Sure, Dad.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.265
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

32:44.310 --> 32:45.920
[Bonham exhales]

32:45.964 --> 32:47.356
This one's for you, darling.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.142
I guess it's--
I guess it's for all of you.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.841
[Bonham clears throat]

32:55.799 --> 32:57.062
All right.

32:59.368 --> 33:00.587
[groans]

33:02.719 --> 33:04.199
â™ª

33:06.114 --> 33:08.421
â™ª I don't know why

33:08.464 --> 33:11.685
â™ª I act the way I do

33:14.514 --> 33:16.211
â™ª Like I ain't got

33:16.255 --> 33:20.172
â™ª A single thing to lose

33:22.217 --> 33:25.960
â™ª Sometimes I'm my own

33:26.004 --> 33:27.875
â™ª Worst enemy

33:29.659 --> 33:32.358
â™ª Well, I guess that's just

33:32.401 --> 33:35.665
â™ª The cowboy in me

33:35.709 --> 33:38.364
[whispers]:
He's still got it.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.714
â™ª I got a life... Hey.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.150
Hey.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.457
I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

33:44.500 --> 33:49.114
Well, you show up for the people
that mean something to you.

33:49.157 --> 33:51.942
â™ª Wake up fightin' mad

33:53.727 --> 33:58.036
â™ª At where this road
I'm headed down â™ª

33:58.079 --> 33:59.863
â™ª Might lead

34:01.474 --> 34:04.303
â™ª Well, I guess that's just

34:04.346 --> 34:08.220
â™ª The cowboy in me

34:10.004 --> 34:12.398
â™ª The urge to... Ger, um...

34:12.441 --> 34:13.834
You know, I...

34:13.877 --> 34:14.574
[sighs]

34:14.617 --> 34:16.054
I've been so worried

34:16.097 --> 34:18.708
about what being
a Davidson means.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.929
But what I'm realizing

34:21.972 --> 34:25.280
is that I want you both
in my life.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.413
The Davidsons,

34:27.456 --> 34:29.806
all you crazy Walkers.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.634
Okay, well, you can have that.

34:31.678 --> 34:37.162
I'm not sure what comes next.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.991
What comes next is this: family,

34:41.035 --> 34:44.169
and our-our friendship,
and, Geri,

34:44.212 --> 34:45.648
I'm all in.

34:45.692 --> 34:46.954
I promise.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.174
I like that.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.090
A new chapter.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.657
Yeah. A new chapter.

34:57.312 --> 35:00.489
â™ª But you set your mind to see

35:00.533 --> 35:03.101
â™ª This love on through

35:05.059 --> 35:09.063
â™ª Well, I guess
that's just the cowboy â™ª

35:09.107 --> 35:12.719
â™ª In you

35:12.762 --> 35:18.333
â™ª We ride and never worry
about the fall â™ª

35:21.249 --> 35:26.602
â™ª Well, I guess
that's just the cowboy â™ª

35:28.082 --> 35:31.520
â™ª In us all.

35:36.264 --> 35:37.874
[cheering, applause]I love you.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.545
[cheering, applause]

35:56.589 --> 35:58.765
Thank you, my boy.

35:58.808 --> 36:00.854
Oh, thank you,
my sweet girl.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.551
Thank you
so much.

36:02.595 --> 36:04.205
I am so happy you're here.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.815
I may be a Davidson now,

36:05.859 --> 36:10.255
but I am still a Walker
through and through.

36:15.129 --> 36:17.044
[exhales]

Thank you, New York,
thank you, too.

Nice pipes, Coach!

36:32.755 --> 36:34.627
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on, go on, go on.

36:34.670 --> 36:37.804
Look at this.[laughter]

36:42.548 --> 36:46.160
All right. Chariot is here.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.729
Drive carefully, Stella.
Precious cargo!

Welcome, welcome.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.399
Make yourselves at home.Wow, this is great.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.183
Put on some music...

37:09.227 --> 37:11.185
Hey.Yeah.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.969
I, um...

37:13.013 --> 37:14.362
I don't think
I would've been able

37:14.406 --> 37:16.538
to face this without your help.

37:16.582 --> 37:19.802
Hmm. Well, you're
Cordi's new partner.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.543
It's kind of a package deal.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.068
You're family now.
And you're welcome.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.419
Well, good.Hey,

37:27.462 --> 37:30.073
since you're all warm and fuzzy,

37:30.117 --> 37:32.380
how would you feel about me
asking your brother out?

37:32.424 --> 37:34.513
[dance music playing softly]

37:35.514 --> 37:37.037
All right.

37:38.168 --> 37:39.300
CASSIE:
Ah.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.259
So you've picked our poison.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.522
Mmm. I've been
feeling this lately.

37:43.565 --> 37:44.958
TX Whiskey.

37:45.001 --> 37:47.265
Mmm. Well, I will be
right back.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.788
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.181
[laughs softly]

37:51.225 --> 37:53.749
Hey, I wanted to float
something by you.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.708
I'm all ears.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.885
So, I've been playing it safe,

37:58.928 --> 38:01.801
you know, focusing
on my family and their needs.

38:01.844 --> 38:05.195
And, uh, I had a good guy
with me for a while.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.589
But, uh,

38:07.633 --> 38:10.592
I wasn't really focusing
on what I wanted.

38:10.636 --> 38:12.159
And I'm done waiting.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.249
A-Are you okay? This is a lot.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.033
I can be a lot someti...Oh, no.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.558
I'm here for it.
[chuckles]Okay.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.951
Great. I, um...

38:21.995 --> 38:23.518
How would you feel about

38:23.562 --> 38:25.694
seeing where this
could lead over dinner?

38:25.738 --> 38:27.653
I think I'd like that.

38:27.696 --> 38:30.264
[door opens][footsteps approach]

38:30.308 --> 38:31.700
[sighs]
So, what'd I miss?

38:31.744 --> 38:33.702
I was about to tell Liam

38:33.746 --> 38:37.315
about the time you tried
to go on a hunger strike

38:37.358 --> 38:40.796
but missed snacks so you settled
on a pants strike.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.668
Oh.
Well, let's just not.

38:42.711 --> 38:43.886
"Pants strike"?

38:43.930 --> 38:45.192
Let me hear
about that, actually...

38:45.235 --> 38:47.020
[laughs]:Never.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.238
Cheers, y'all.Cheers.
Cheers.

38:48.282 --> 38:51.111
Welcome.Thank you.

38:53.113 --> 38:54.288
[pounding on door]

38:54.332 --> 38:57.378
Come in! Uh, door's unlocked.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.467
Jackets, keys,
anything left behind,

38:59.511 --> 39:02.122
I-I put into the
lost and found. Uh...

39:02.165 --> 39:04.429
Twyla. Hi.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.692
I didn't want to crash
the family shindig.

39:06.735 --> 39:08.737
I never got the chance

39:08.781 --> 39:10.783
to properly thank you earlier.

39:10.826 --> 39:13.046
Oh. Well...
[chuckles]

39:13.089 --> 39:14.830
No, don't-don't...

39:14.874 --> 39:17.920
Don't worry about that, Twyla,
I... just...

39:17.964 --> 39:19.792
just doing my job.
[clears throat]

39:19.835 --> 39:22.272
Hmm.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.796
You know,
I guess I hadn't really

39:23.839 --> 39:25.363
put it together till today.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.367
Even when you were
playing dress-up,

39:29.410 --> 39:32.152
calling yourself "Duke,"

39:32.195 --> 39:34.850
you really were
getting to know me.

â™ª

40:04.445 --> 40:07.579
â™ª You were never mine

40:07.622 --> 40:09.407
â™ª Only in secret...

40:09.450 --> 40:11.017
Whatever happened to, uh,

40:11.060 --> 40:13.715
that clean slate we talked about
when I helped you

40:13.759 --> 40:15.587
secure an early release
from prison?
