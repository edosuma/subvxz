AUGUST 4TH, 1987 6:37 A.M.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.702
Why on earth are you home so late?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.537
Shut up, you old bitch!

02:43.037 --> 02:45.748
Old bitch? How dare you call me that!

02:45.832 --> 02:48.501
Megumi, come back here!

03:05.393 --> 03:06.394
Newspaper?

03:08.229 --> 03:09.105
Yes.

03:10.189 --> 03:14.068
Could you get it for me?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.507
<i>Dad was home every day </i>

03:37.008 --> 03:39.385
<i>during my summer vacation
in my third year of junior high school.</i>

03:41.387 --> 03:45.141
It was your fault, so stop moping around.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.269
It's awkward for me at work now too.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.612
Hey.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.908
Knock it off when Haruko comes home.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.580
Does she...

04:09.457 --> 04:11.042
-know?
-About what?

04:12.669 --> 04:17.173
I wouldn't tell her!
Not when her fiancé is here.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.676
Stop worrying about your image.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.680
You better be home at 6:00 p.m.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.807
Don't mess around and be late.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.268
Wash the dishes.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.652
<i>A bit before summer vacation started,</i>

04:38.361 --> 04:42.198
<i>Dad hit a motorcyclist while driving.</i>

04:45.576 --> 04:49.038
<i>Luckily, neither of them got hurt.</i>

04:49.580 --> 04:50.581
I'm off to my club.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.334
<i>But Dad had alcohol in his blood</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:55.628
<i>and was a high school teacher,</i>

04:56.212 --> 04:58.881
<i>so he got suspended for a while</i>

04:59.924 --> 05:01.676
<i>and stayed home every day.</i>

05:06.014 --> 05:08.808
Good morning, Taka my dear.
Do you have school club?

05:09.559 --> 05:12.895
I'll leave these veggies in your kitchen.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.987
Hey. Is Tadao still depressed?

05:21.946 --> 05:23.656
Is Yoshiko bullying him?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.326
She can be so mean.

05:27.035 --> 05:32.415
At a time like this,
a wife should support her husband.

05:33.624 --> 05:36.586
-When we...
<i>-After Dad got suspended,</i>

05:37.003 --> 05:39.213
<i>Grandma, who lived in the annex,</i>

05:39.630 --> 05:42.467
<i>came in everyday when Mom was out.</i>

05:42.550 --> 05:45.887
What is she thinking?
I can't understand her at all.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.096
I'm going.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.849
Bye now. Take care.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.561
Oh, Haru is coming today, isn't she?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.147
Has Yoshiko prepared anything?

05:56.564 --> 05:58.483
Hey! Takashi.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.653
Put some proper clothes on.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.823
Buy August's <i>Pure Literature</i> for me. Here.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.576
Why don't you buy it?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.245
I'll buy it for you.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.749
You're still submitting?

06:18.252 --> 06:19.754
That silly boy.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.341
He's not a criminal.
There's no need to be ashamed.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.010
Right?

06:27.428 --> 06:28.679
He is a criminal.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.348
What?

06:52.286 --> 06:55.748
<i>When did I start
thinking of Dad as pathetic?</i>

06:59.085 --> 07:05.842
<i>When his novels didn't get selected
and he took it out on us?</i>

07:07.510 --> 07:09.762
<i>When we got overtaken
in my elementary school's</i>

07:09.846 --> 07:12.515
<i>parent-child race?</i>

07:12.598 --> 07:14.267
Pardon me, but...

07:14.350 --> 07:17.562
<i>When he failed
the vice-principal exam yearly</i>

07:17.645 --> 07:19.480
<i>-despite paying bribes?</i>
-Please!

07:19.564 --> 07:20.940
Please!

07:22.567 --> 07:25.153
<i>Anyway, at some point,</i>

07:25.236 --> 07:28.239
<i>I decided I didn't want
to become like Dad.</i>

08:16.287 --> 08:17.622
He dodges!

08:17.705 --> 08:19.749
Inoki is mad!

08:19.832 --> 08:22.168
Here comes a Knuckle Part!

08:22.502 --> 08:23.753

Here comes a Knuckle Part!

08:26.964 --> 08:28.966

Yatsu, you go.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.428
Yatsu!

08:33.179 --> 08:36.390
Yatsu gets a <i>manji-gatame</i>!

08:37.517 --> 08:40.436
You suck for an All Japan champ!

08:40.520 --> 08:41.562
That hurts!

08:42.271 --> 08:44.899
Will Choshu get up?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.526
Choshu is done.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.194
Come get it, you dumbass!

08:51.614 --> 08:55.076
A <i>manji-gatame</i> for Choshu!

08:56.077 --> 08:57.787
Yatsu! Cut it out.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.417
Choshu is finished!

09:15.346 --> 09:16.806

09:17.306 --> 09:19.100
Okay, one more time.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.602
One more time. Go back.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.855

09:24.939 --> 09:27.316

09:28.317 --> 09:29.652
Don't think.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.281
Smile. Here we go!

09:33.364 --> 09:34.865
Ready, action!

09:35.449 --> 09:38.369
Hey. Don't get angry over it.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.371
I found out afterward.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.498
Afterward.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.377
Takeuchi gets too carried away.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.546
That hurt.

09:51.924 --> 09:52.883
Hey.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.595
What, they're filming again?

09:57.179 --> 09:59.974
Noda! What are you filming?

10:01.684 --> 10:04.770
What? Are they at it again?

10:06.564 --> 10:11.569
Damn it! Noda!
Don't you dare make a porno!

10:18.284 --> 10:21.120
Hey. We're shooting for real.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.080
Don't ruin it.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.459
What? But, sir, you're our judo coach.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.336
I am, but...

10:28.461 --> 10:29.795
I'll look in later.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.048
Do <i>ukemi.</i>

10:32.131 --> 10:33.382
Or <i>dandori.</i>

10:33.466 --> 10:36.218
It's not <i>dandori</i>, it's <i>randori</i>!

10:36.677 --> 10:39.472
If you mess that up again,
I'll give you an Antonio Special!

10:40.222 --> 10:41.182
No...

10:41.265 --> 10:42.308
No, thanks.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.978
We'll be done soon, okay?

10:46.771 --> 10:47.605
Okay?

10:49.482 --> 10:50.608
Let's go!

10:54.070 --> 10:56.322
Shush, my ass.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.616
Chrome dome!

11:03.329 --> 11:04.997
They're crazy.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.792
Is it for <i>Action Camera</i>?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.377
It could be.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.129
Noda has read it since elementary school.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.465
You read it too.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.093
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.302
-No, I didn't.
-You did.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.804
-No, I didn't.
-Don't lie.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.389
You dick. I read <i>Scholar</i>.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.140
But, you know,

11:26.102 --> 11:30.064
it's like they've changed
since they won that award.

11:30.689 --> 11:31.774
How?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.528
Kind of...

11:35.611 --> 11:37.655
It's because of that newspaper story.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.783
Let's piledrive them at homeroom.

11:44.161 --> 11:47.832
I want to feel up Yokushimaru's tits!

11:48.124 --> 11:49.875
For real!

11:53.754 --> 11:55.840
Yokushimaru!

11:56.382 --> 12:00.219
Let me feel you up!

12:02.221 --> 12:04.640
What? Don't you guys want to?

12:05.307 --> 12:09.103
Hey, isn't today the day she comes?

12:09.687 --> 12:11.981
Oh, it is. To World.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.482
Is it today?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.860
Anyway, who said so?

12:15.943 --> 12:17.862
Isn't it just a rumor?

12:18.279 --> 12:21.657
Kyoko Koizumi was
supposed to come last year

12:21.740 --> 12:22.700
but she didn't.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.369
That was obviously fake.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.040
The Hong Kong mafia was
going to attack Japan too.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.460
Mitsuru said his dad got shot.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.336
Right?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.839
Hey!

12:37.465 --> 12:39.216
-Hey!
-That hurts!

12:39.633 --> 12:41.552
Hey, you'll break it.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.221
Inoki and I are arm-breakers.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.306
That hurts!

12:45.389 --> 12:46.348
How about it?

12:47.183 --> 12:48.225
What?

12:49.351 --> 12:53.939
Well, do you want to stop by World
after school?

12:55.065 --> 12:56.859
They might have information.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.864
You want to suck
Yokushimaru's titties that much?

13:02.656 --> 13:05.451
It's not anything like that.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.869
Bullshit!

13:07.203 --> 13:08.829
It's me!

13:08.913 --> 13:12.124
Black Angels!

13:12.666 --> 13:13.751
Black Angels!

Okada?

15:06.697 --> 15:08.198
You scared me.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.997
There's no Yokushimaru information.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.418
The rumor's a fake?

15:23.130 --> 15:25.633
I bet there's information in there.

-Mitsuru, go look.
-No way.

I said, which junior high?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.348
Kawakita Junior High.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.768

Don't say "no" to me.

Hey! You little punks.

16:28.696 --> 16:33.200

Do you want me to?

-Hey.

Yours isn't either.

What?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.927
What are you laughing at?

16:52.469 --> 16:54.847
Mine rolled back the other day.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.433
What? Is that something to be proud of?

16:57.516 --> 16:58.392
Well...

16:58.475 --> 16:59.852
Here, your lunch.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.439
I asked for fried chicken.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.898
It's got one piece.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.025
-What?
-What?

17:06.108 --> 17:06.942
What?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.696
-So it does.
-Yes.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.866
Sure.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.703
Hey, they go to Kawakita

17:17.911 --> 17:19.747
but they don't know Yoshida.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.374
He was in your year, you dumbass.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.333
What?

17:23.417 --> 17:26.336
-Take your break.
-What the hell?

17:26.795 --> 17:29.423
-I'm taking my break.
-Okay.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.326
Quit standing there.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.119
Okay.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.335
Anyway, let's rent something.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.463
She's got big tits.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.924
I want to suck them.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.511
Would she let me for 500 yen?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.055
For 500 yen?

18:18.764 --> 18:19.848
What?

18:20.516 --> 18:22.059
Hey. Where's <i>The Story of O</i>?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.186
Who the hell rented it?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.271
It used to be here.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.898
Choose a Japanese one.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.734
No way! I hate Japanese!

18:31.276 --> 18:34.530
-You're Japanese.
-Shithead! I'm American.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.907
There's <i>The Story of O</i>!

18:40.285 --> 18:41.495
Found it!

18:42.621 --> 18:43.914
<i>The Story of O.</i>

18:46.834 --> 18:49.711
Hey, you've got good taste.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.631
How many years have you been fishing?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.553
How many years?

19:12.860 --> 19:13.944
Mitsuru?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.113
-Mitsuru?
-What?

19:17.573 --> 19:18.615
Get this.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.993
What?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.245
She's got hooks

19:24.079 --> 19:25.747
stuck in her.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.501
-It's okay. Well then...
-Okay. Have you picked one?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.129
Ready, go!

19:32.212 --> 19:35.674
<i>-First is rock, then scissors, then paper
-First is rock, then scissors, then paper</i>

19:35.757 --> 19:37.342
<i>-Rock, paper, scissors
-Rock, paper, scissors</i>

19:37.426 --> 19:39.094
-One more time.
<i>-It cost us over 1,000 yen...</i>

19:39.178 --> 19:40.888
-Draw!
<i>-to rent a video.</i>

19:40.971 --> 19:44.016
-Draw!
<i>-So we put our money together...</i>

19:44.099 --> 19:45.934
-Draw!
<i>-played rock, paper, scissors...</i>

19:46.018 --> 19:47.686
-Draw!
<i>-and watched the winner's choice...</i>

19:47.769 --> 19:49.771
-Draw!
<i>-at Mitsuru's house.</i>

19:49.855 --> 19:53.442
-Draw!
-Draw!

19:53.525 --> 19:56.236
Screw this!

19:56.320 --> 19:58.572
Let's start over from the beginning.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.698
Here we go.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.658
<i>-First is...
-First is paper</i>

20:01.742 --> 20:03.368
Yes! I beat all three of you!

20:03.869 --> 20:05.162
Mitsuru, go pay.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.955
-I'll hold this.
-What?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.291
You found 1,000 yen yesterday.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.547
It's 1,200 yen.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.809
Hey.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.187
Hey!

20:34.024 --> 20:38.320
Well, today, my dad might be home.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.821
-What?
-What?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.573
What about pachinko?

20:43.158 --> 20:46.119
He's got no money this month.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.998
Bullshit! Get him out of there now!

20:50.082 --> 20:51.250
What will we do?

20:51.541 --> 20:54.586
<i>Mitsuru's dad, an ex-truck driver,</i>

20:55.170 --> 20:59.341
<i>was paralyzed in an accident
and just played pachinko.</i>

21:01.093 --> 21:03.220
<i>His mom wasn't around.</i>

21:05.222 --> 21:08.183
-Go, damn it.
-I can't!

21:08.267 --> 21:09.351
Hey, Meathead!

21:09.434 --> 21:13.063
-It's Meathead!
-Hey there, Meathead!

21:16.900 --> 21:17.901
What?

21:19.027 --> 21:21.029
Bullying the weak kid?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.156
Come on, Meathead.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.367
You'll get arrested for that.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.661
You copied my hairstyle.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.792
Don't tell me you came
to see Kyoko Yokushimaru.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.962
-Is that it?
-You're too early!

21:37.045 --> 21:38.630
What did you rent?

21:41.300 --> 21:45.470
<i>The Story of O</i>! We were going to get that.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.266
It's way out of your league.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.559
Way out!

21:50.642 --> 21:52.602
I'll take care of this.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.065
What? You've got a problem?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.652
You don't, do you?

22:00.736 --> 22:01.945
Let's go!

22:02.029 --> 22:03.071
Come on.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.573
-I'm coming.
-Me too.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.074
Single eyelids!

22:06.533 --> 22:08.035
Yoshioka!

22:08.368 --> 22:09.494
Laugh, damn it!

22:09.578 --> 22:12.205
It isn't funny! I can do it too!

22:12.289 --> 22:13.957
-That's sick!
-Shut up!

22:14.499 --> 22:15.417
That's right!

22:15.500 --> 22:16.877
See you, Meathead.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.423
Later, Meathead.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.883
Bye, Meathead.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.718
Don't fix your hair!

22:24.801 --> 22:26.303
You better not!

22:32.893 --> 22:34.019
I...

22:46.323 --> 22:49.576
was almost ready to kick their asses.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.458
Kaneda and his guys

22:58.794 --> 23:00.670
are already having sex.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.059
Is that true?

23:15.977 --> 23:18.230
Hey. Is that true?

23:18.980 --> 23:19.940
What?

23:20.023 --> 23:22.442
Kaneda and his guys having sex.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.031
If they are, why would they have
to watch <i>The Story of O</i>?

23:29.699 --> 23:34.329
I mean, I don't really want to
watch it either.

23:34.412 --> 23:35.705
I'm beyond that.

23:36.206 --> 23:40.293
Anyway, they touch more boobs than we do.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.546
That's enough to envy them.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.674
Kaneda felt up Megumi Nishino.

23:49.427 --> 23:52.722
Isn't she going out
with some bike gang guy?

23:53.348 --> 23:54.724
Is she doing it?

23:55.892 --> 23:58.186
I bet she is, 100 percent.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.981
Kaneda's guys said so.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.119
Screw it.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.705
Let's watch that bootleg video again.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.665
With the black people?

24:19.249 --> 24:21.084
Who's got it now?

24:22.711 --> 24:23.753
I do.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.089
Are you watching it every day?

24:26.173 --> 24:27.507
Like hell I am.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.051
It's creepy. And fuzzy.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.262
Maybe black porn doesn't turn me on.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.432
It sure turned me on.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.559
It's Kemeko.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.195
Rambo!

24:48.737 --> 24:52.407
I told you this is off-limits,
you pig-faced grunt!

24:56.161 --> 24:58.079
Hey, you bullshitting gorilla.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.208
What are you grinning at?

25:01.791 --> 25:03.210
I'll waste you.

25:03.835 --> 25:07.255
All you talk about is money, asshole.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.008
You want to die? Then die.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.676
Retard. Scumbag.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.681
Dumbass. Shithead. Moron. Clown.

25:16.765 --> 25:20.769
Buckteeth. Mutant navel.
Cockroach. Stinkweed.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.344
Will we?

26:00.225 --> 26:01.268
What?

26:06.189 --> 26:08.858
-Oh, forget it.
-Spit it out.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.654
Well...

26:15.991 --> 26:17.701
Will we ever?

26:24.457 --> 26:25.792
Boobs.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.714
What about boobs?

26:35.844 --> 26:39.723
Will we ever get to feel up boobs
all we want?

26:40.515 --> 26:41.766
That was random.

26:44.060 --> 26:47.439
Don't you ever worry about that?

26:47.897 --> 26:49.441
Feeling up boobs?

26:49.524 --> 26:50.984
No. I'll just do it.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.320
You worry about that?

26:57.115 --> 27:01.494
Noda has a better chance
of feeling up boobs than we do.

27:01.745 --> 27:05.498
Noda from the film club?
Who cares about that dork?

27:05.832 --> 27:09.044
I get the feeling he's left us behind.

27:09.419 --> 27:10.879
Left us behind how?

27:20.847 --> 27:22.182
I thought

27:24.976 --> 27:26.895
we were better than them.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.147
In every way.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.399
Better in what way?

27:37.072 --> 27:39.574
Well, I'm not really sure.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.411
As people, I guess.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.916
That's a shitty thing to say!

27:48.541 --> 27:49.584
Terminate!

27:52.629 --> 27:54.672
I mean, I can run faster.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.341
So can I.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.804
I'm more cheerful than them.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.222
So am I.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.809
They're no good at studying

28:06.393 --> 28:08.603
and they were easy to ignore

28:11.481 --> 28:12.774
until that award.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.404
So...

28:21.074 --> 28:22.492
I've been thinking.

28:22.617 --> 28:23.618
What about?

28:24.244 --> 28:25.662
Feeling up boobs?

28:27.956 --> 28:30.917
No. Kaneda's guys are delinquents,

28:31.334 --> 28:33.586
so feeling up boobs is no big deal.

28:35.171 --> 28:38.633
Takeda plays baseball.
Higaki plays basketball.

28:39.968 --> 28:43.263
Popular guys like them
get to feel up boobs.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.182
When Noda's guys

28:47.392 --> 28:49.144
become famous directors,

28:49.227 --> 28:51.438
they'll screw actresses.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.023
You dickhead. They won't.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.151
Unless they become Shinya Yamamoto.

28:58.778 --> 29:01.740
Shinya Yamamoto gets more girls than us.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.199
Like hell he does!

29:03.324 --> 29:05.910
I bet he does. He's famous.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.747
What? He isn't famous at all.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.790
He's more famous than us.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.084
What's your point?

29:13.585 --> 29:14.794
I don't get it.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.504
Not one bit.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.805
What I mean is,

29:32.979 --> 29:36.566
we don't have anything
that makes us special.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.780
We're not delinquents,
artists, or athletes.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.450
We're totally unattached.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.623
We're the type of people

29:51.915 --> 29:53.958
who are easy to ignore.

29:57.128 --> 30:00.465
Among everybody out there,
we're below average.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.766
Since I started thinking that,

30:12.143 --> 30:13.645
I haven't slept well.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.407
What the hell, man?

30:26.866 --> 30:30.161
You really bummed me out.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.831
So we're like Kemeko?

30:33.289 --> 30:35.291
No, not on your life.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.585
Damn.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.922
I wish I was a natural-born
delinquent too.

31:02.944 --> 31:03.945
Hey!

31:07.615 --> 31:11.327
You guys want to go see
if Kyoko Yokushimaru is coming?

31:14.247 --> 31:18.668
At midnight, we might get
to suck on her titties.

31:21.462 --> 31:23.214
What are you, chicken?

31:24.257 --> 31:25.717
I'm not, but...

31:26.175 --> 31:28.011
Won't Kaneda's guys be there?

31:28.094 --> 31:30.346
Dumbass. Don't be scared of them!

31:31.097 --> 31:33.266
Takashi? You're in, right?

31:34.350 --> 31:35.602
Well...

31:36.978 --> 31:39.981
-Oh, I can't.
-Why? You're not going?

31:40.648 --> 31:44.360
My big sister is bringing
her fiancé home tonight.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.696
-What?
-I've got cram school.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.782
What the hell? Fiancés and cram school?

31:50.158 --> 31:51.784
Forget that shit!

31:56.748 --> 31:58.458
It's Yokushimaru's tits!

31:58.875 --> 32:00.335
Don't you want to suck them?

32:01.711 --> 32:02.921
I want to suck them!

32:04.797 --> 32:06.424
Mitsuru!

32:07.842 --> 32:09.427
It's just you and me.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.764
Those guys are wimps.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.767
You're both pathetic.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.269
Mitsuru's got more guts than you!

32:19.395 --> 32:20.438
Let's go.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.233
They're here, they're queer.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.570
Check out those two queers behind us.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.198
I'll go!

32:30.615 --> 32:32.450
I can ditch cram school easily.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.621
Way to go, Okada. You're a go-getter.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.247
Takashi?

32:43.419 --> 32:46.214
I'll go too.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.676
Right on! See you at school at 9:00 p.m.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.179
I better see you. No pussying out.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.308
If you do,
I'll put your dicks in a <i>manji-gatame</i>.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.143
Got that?

33:02.772 --> 33:07.193
This is even more out of the way
than I imagined.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.321
I told you there's nothing here.

33:10.405 --> 33:14.951
I wouldn't say nothing but still...

33:15.994 --> 33:18.037
Mind if we drive more?

33:18.121 --> 33:20.081
To keep our meeting short.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.961
Sorry, this is bad timing.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.796
Hey.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.423
What?

33:29.298 --> 33:32.927
Oh, it's just,
that kid looked like my brother.

33:34.262 --> 33:38.057
No, it can't be my brother. He's cuter.

33:38.850 --> 33:39.809
What?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.615
I'm home.

34:03.416 --> 34:07.211
You're earlier than usual!

34:10.465 --> 34:11.841
Haruko is coming.

34:12.091 --> 34:13.051
Oh, right.

34:13.968 --> 34:16.721
What time is she coming?

34:21.768 --> 34:22.977
Around 7:00 p.m.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.146
Oh, that's right.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.691
Grandma went shopping.

34:30.526 --> 34:31.569
Yes.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.074
-What's that?
-What?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.702
A video is playing.

34:41.913 --> 34:42.914
Oh, that.

34:44.457 --> 34:45.374
What?

34:45.917 --> 34:47.126
Your mom is late.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.045
What?

34:49.587 --> 34:50.797
Don't do that!

34:51.297 --> 34:53.883
You'll break it if you just yank it out!

34:53.966 --> 34:55.176
I wasn't yanking it.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.930
I'll fix it! Okay?

35:01.808 --> 35:03.142
You did yank it.

35:43.558 --> 35:48.146
BLACK WOMAN HUNTING PART 3

35:53.568 --> 35:56.612
Tadao, I bought your magazine.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.008
Your novel wasn't chosen again?

36:42.617 --> 36:43.993
Should you drink?

36:49.624 --> 36:51.250
I'm going to anyway.

36:52.668 --> 36:54.712
Haruko is bringing what's-his-name.

37:01.844 --> 37:06.015
You're right. You've done your penance.
You can drink.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.517
I will too.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.443
Tadao's blood pressure
has been high lately

37:17.693 --> 37:21.030
so his doctor said no spicy food.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.406
I know that.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.576
The flavor is richer than usual.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.163
Haruko's fiancé is coming,

37:29.247 --> 37:31.123
so I changed it for him.

37:31.207 --> 37:36.212
-But everyone will eat it.
-Young people like it like this.

37:36.295 --> 37:38.172
An old person will eat it too.

37:38.256 --> 37:42.343
-This is too rich.
-Then eat something else.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.304
Go get your father.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.556
They'll be here soon.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.603
He'll stay out there as long as he can.

37:55.481 --> 37:58.901
Lend me a hand, why don't you? I'm busy.

38:15.584 --> 38:16.627
Hey!

38:18.421 --> 38:20.589
Mom said it's time to stop weeding.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.219
Hey, Mom said stop it.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.271
Tadao, how much longer
will you be doing that?

38:36.105 --> 38:38.858
You don't have to do that now.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.944
Yes, I do. The grass has grown.

38:42.028 --> 38:46.115
Give the mosquitoes a rest.
Come inside now.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.243
Leave me alone! The grass has grown!

38:49.785 --> 38:53.873
What's wrong? Why are you so irritable?

38:54.623 --> 38:56.083
I'm not irritable!

38:56.417 --> 38:59.003
It gets narrow there.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.589
Keep going. All right.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.384
All right.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.595
All right.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.806
All right.

39:13.225 --> 39:16.062
I'm home. Mom, I'm here.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.688
-Hello, dear.
-Hi, Mom.

39:17.772 --> 39:18.981
Welcome home.

39:19.065 --> 39:23.361
-It's nice to meet you. I'm Maeda.
-Nice to meet you.

39:23.444 --> 39:27.198
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Of course.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.367
Hello.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.161
-This is my mom and my grandmother.
-It's a pleasure.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.205
-Darling, come on. Takashi, hurry.
-Welcome to our home.

39:34.288 --> 39:37.500
This is a small gift from Hato Sable.

39:37.583 --> 39:40.086
-Thank you.
-What a lovely gesture.

39:40.169 --> 39:42.713
-Please come in.
-Pardon me.

39:43.130 --> 39:44.340
Okay.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.259
Hey, it's Takashi.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.136
-Are you taller?
-Tadao!

39:49.220 --> 39:50.930
-Oh, come on.
-You're so big.

40:03.734 --> 40:07.238
Come and sit down already. Tadao?

40:07.571 --> 40:10.533
-Darling!
-It was around here.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.454
Hey, it won't be in there!

40:15.538 --> 40:19.166
Sit down! Forget about your camera.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.963
But it was somewhere in there.

40:25.881 --> 40:29.718
All right, let's make a toast.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.012
Please take this.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.097
Okay.

40:34.473 --> 40:35.683
Cheers!

40:36.016 --> 40:37.643
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

40:37.726 --> 40:39.895
-Thank you for this.
-Thank you for coming.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.022
-You've come so far.
-It's fine.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.400
It's not much, but please dig in.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.484
I sure will.

40:45.568 --> 40:49.280
It's from an escape movie
with somebody named McQueen.

40:49.363 --> 40:53.242
-I don't know any "McSomebody."
-I do. I like McQueen.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.535
<i>The Great Escape.</i>

40:54.618 --> 40:57.580
That's it!

40:57.663 --> 41:00.499
Haruo Mizuno often shows it on television.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.752
Just as well as you gave up on acting

41:03.836 --> 41:05.963
for a proper job.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.924
-I see.
-I wasn't really serious about it.

41:09.008 --> 41:13.345
-You seemed serious to me.
-I did dream briefly

41:13.429 --> 41:14.972
about becoming an actor.

41:15.055 --> 41:17.016
But you went to a national university

41:17.099 --> 41:20.519
-and joined a good company.
-That's right.

41:20.769 --> 41:24.523
Oh, this one wanted to become a singer.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.151
-Like Seiko Matsuda.
-What? I didn't know.

41:27.234 --> 41:30.404
Stop it. And it wasn't Seiko Matsuda.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.657
She was always singing.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.911
-She even won a prize at a festival.
-I said, stop!

41:36.994 --> 41:40.456
Is that so? You're good at singing.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.082
You should have tried it!

41:42.166 --> 41:46.837
-I never would've made it.
-Who knows? Maybe you would've.

41:47.463 --> 41:50.049
Oh, what do you want to be, Takashi?

41:50.132 --> 41:51.050
What?

41:51.133 --> 41:52.593
Jackie Chan, right?

41:52.676 --> 41:53.886
-What?
-Really?

41:53.969 --> 41:55.095
So do I.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.723
No, he doesn't like acting.

41:57.806 --> 41:59.058
Just Jackie Chan.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.351
I do not!

42:00.434 --> 42:03.562
That's great. It's a great dream.

42:03.646 --> 42:06.440
Why not be the next Jackie Chan?

42:07.149 --> 42:08.609
You should go for it.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.362
I want to help my kids chase their dreams.

42:11.445 --> 42:15.616
-What a lovely thought.
-That's wonderful.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.789
Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.

42:22.289 --> 42:25.626
Mr. Oyama, I hear you write novels.

42:27.419 --> 42:31.006
He just aims for awards
and never passes the first round.

42:32.132 --> 42:33.634
Who says I haven't?

42:34.468 --> 42:36.804
I've passed plenty of times.

42:36.887 --> 42:38.973
Well, that's impressive.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.975
I'd like to read one sometime.

42:41.767 --> 42:45.813
Really. Like you know
what pure literature is.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.690
Why not lend him one?

42:47.982 --> 42:50.401
Nobody else wants to read them.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.529
What?

42:54.405 --> 42:55.489
Your novels?

42:55.573 --> 42:57.783
Oh, it doesn't have to be now.

42:58.242 --> 43:01.036
My camera. I know it's here.

43:01.453 --> 43:04.123
Forget it! How silly.

43:04.206 --> 43:06.667
-Sorry about this.
-It's fine.

43:08.627 --> 43:12.548
Hey, you. Come over here.

43:16.969 --> 43:18.679
That really is impressive.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.474
The next Jackie Chan and a novelist.

43:22.766 --> 43:25.436
Only in their dreams.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.689
I hope they come true.

43:29.523 --> 43:30.649
Snake's fist!

43:32.026 --> 43:32.985
Snake's fist!

43:34.778 --> 43:35.863
Snake's fist!

43:38.574 --> 43:41.285
Say it before he gets too drunk.

43:42.161 --> 43:45.205
He's already cranky because of his novel.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.416
Yes.

43:52.379 --> 43:53.881
I hate this.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.259
I'm not making fun of the snake's fist.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.803
I'm not "snaking" fun of it.

44:00.095 --> 44:02.348
Takashi, don't get "snaky."

44:02.431 --> 44:03.807
How witty.

44:05.392 --> 44:07.394
-I'm going.
-Wait!

44:07.478 --> 44:10.230
Sit down. Kneeling.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.444
Dad, come and sit down already.

44:16.278 --> 44:18.614
-Come on, darling.
-Tadao.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.282
What?

44:26.372 --> 44:28.123
Oh, that's it!

44:28.582 --> 44:31.001
Come on, Dad!

44:31.085 --> 44:33.462
Please! Tadao!

44:33.837 --> 44:36.423
-Please sit down!
-That hurts!

44:36.507 --> 44:40.803
All right! Don't pinch me!

44:54.566 --> 44:56.693
Mr. Oyama.

44:59.113 --> 45:02.908
Please give me your blessing
to marry Haruko.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.454
I'm not much

45:08.122 --> 45:11.834
and I'm sure you think
I'm still wet behind the ears.

45:12.459 --> 45:14.461
Even so, I'll do my best.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.340
I'll do my best. Whatever it takes

45:19.716 --> 45:21.593
to make Haruko happy.

45:26.598 --> 45:27.724
It's in there!

45:28.267 --> 45:30.060
Damn it, Dad!

45:30.144 --> 45:31.437
Tadao!

45:31.770 --> 45:36.024
Look for your camera later!
Don't be pathetic!

45:36.900 --> 45:38.652
I'm not pathetic!

45:38.777 --> 45:40.904
It's your fault for always moving things

45:41.029 --> 45:44.032
like the television remote!

45:44.116 --> 45:46.368
Don't yell! We have a guest!

45:46.452 --> 45:48.078
Tadao!

45:49.746 --> 45:51.081
And...

45:51.707 --> 45:52.916
And you.

45:53.333 --> 45:57.796
You must be a failed actor
because you don't fool me.

45:58.255 --> 46:02.426
If I wanted to find fault with you,

46:03.552 --> 46:04.803
I would have a field day.

46:05.095 --> 46:05.971
What?

46:06.054 --> 46:07.681
What has come over you?

46:08.223 --> 46:09.766
Maybe you do

46:10.267 --> 46:12.519
work for a good company,

46:12.936 --> 46:15.772
but how do we know?

46:16.315 --> 46:18.859
-Let me explain.
-There's no need.

46:19.443 --> 46:23.238
Dad, you'd better knock it off right now.

46:27.451 --> 46:30.454
That's enough, Tadao.

46:30.537 --> 46:32.164
Get some sleep.

46:32.247 --> 46:34.082
Okay? Sleep.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.127
I'm sorry.

46:37.252 --> 46:41.048
He's been nervous all day, and he's drunk.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.259
I'm not drunk! I'm not!

46:45.219 --> 46:49.598
No. You're not drunk.
Just lie down. Please.

46:49.681 --> 46:51.016
There you go again,

46:51.099 --> 46:56.855
-treating me like a child!
-I'm not. Just lie down.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.982
-You think...
-Care for some more?

46:59.066 --> 47:01.109
I'll be a good boy all my life.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.402
Well, you're wrong!

47:03.195 --> 47:05.322
I didn't break the bamboo fence!

47:06.615 --> 47:09.117
-What bamboo fence?
-Enjoy.

47:09.201 --> 47:11.745
Back in elementary school, in our yard!

47:11.828 --> 47:13.372
I didn't break it!

47:14.331 --> 47:16.416
You and Dad blamed me

47:16.500 --> 47:19.586
but I didn't break it!

47:20.170 --> 47:21.922
The bike shop guy did!

47:23.048 --> 47:25.717
But I wasn't rebellious back then.

47:26.385 --> 47:29.429
Well, I'm in my rebellious phase now!

47:29.805 --> 47:32.099
If you look down on me,
you better watch out!

47:32.182 --> 47:34.434
No one's looking down on you.

47:34.518 --> 47:35.602
Yes, you are!

47:35.686 --> 47:37.020
Knock it off!

47:40.983 --> 47:42.317
You need to stop

47:43.110 --> 47:46.780
dragging me down
when things go bad for you!

47:46.863 --> 47:50.409
I know you got suspended
and pretended not to know!

47:51.285 --> 47:54.329
You can't talk to me like that!

47:59.001 --> 48:02.254
-Hey! Where are you going?
-Butt out!

48:02.337 --> 48:03.547
Who gives a shit?

48:03.630 --> 48:06.925
How dare you speak to me like that!

48:07.009 --> 48:08.885
You're an embarrassment!

48:08.969 --> 48:11.680
How dare you! I'm your father!

48:18.979 --> 48:20.230
<i>It was my first-ever</i>

48:21.231 --> 48:23.358
<i>judo victory.</i>

48:36.997 --> 48:37.914
What?

48:48.800 --> 48:50.260
Well...

48:52.679 --> 48:53.722
Well...

48:55.807 --> 48:57.184
What?

48:57.351 --> 48:59.394
What?

49:01.647 --> 49:03.315
Tadao!

49:05.484 --> 49:08.403
Hey! You would raise your hands to me?

49:08.487 --> 49:09.738
Fine! Hit me!

49:09.821 --> 49:11.031
Hit me all you like!

49:11.323 --> 49:13.283
I'm sick of this!

49:15.494 --> 49:17.537
Tadao!

49:34.721 --> 49:36.390
That was one hell of a show.

50:36.616 --> 50:41.621
-Come on! I'll get you!
-Take me on if you can!

50:41.913 --> 50:44.249
-I'll get you!
-Okay!

50:48.712 --> 50:52.340
-You're late, Takashi!
-Hey, get over here!

50:52.424 --> 50:56.178
-These are going out!
-Come on!

50:56.261 --> 50:58.555
Hurry up and get over here!

50:58.847 --> 51:00.140
Hurry up!

51:00.223 --> 51:02.476
You're so damn slow.

51:03.351 --> 51:05.312
You're going to see Kyoko Yokushimaru?

51:05.395 --> 51:08.273
How sweet. Take us with you.

51:09.524 --> 51:13.278
I'll give you a lint brush.
Stylish, right?

51:13.361 --> 51:14.988
I'll give you a nightstick.

51:15.071 --> 51:17.157
No, I'll take that.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.201
Here, take it.

51:20.619 --> 51:24.539
-Titty-sucking is after midnight, right?
-How exciting.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.292
Do a little job for us first.

51:27.709 --> 51:30.253
But we're just...

51:30.337 --> 51:31.379
What?

51:33.840 --> 51:39.513
Your video, <i>The Story of O</i>,
was a waste of our valuable time.

51:39.596 --> 51:40.639
Take responsibility.

51:40.722 --> 51:43.600
-Take it!
-You're responsible!

51:43.683 --> 51:45.769
-Let's go!
-Gather at my finger.

51:45.852 --> 51:48.355
-Come on!
-What? No way.

51:48.438 --> 51:50.565
Gather at what?

51:51.191 --> 51:52.275
When were you born?

51:52.359 --> 51:54.361
Move. We're going.

52:00.617 --> 52:01.576
Where's Takeuchi?

52:02.452 --> 52:04.788
-He said he's sick.
-What?

52:06.998 --> 52:09.292
When I said Takeuchi was coming,

52:09.709 --> 52:11.253
Kaneda made me call him.

52:11.962 --> 52:14.881
He was just about to leave home,

52:15.215 --> 52:18.134
but when I told him about Kaneda,
he said he has a fever.

52:20.345 --> 52:22.180
Was he serious?

52:22.264 --> 52:23.932
Hell no, he was lying!

52:24.808 --> 52:26.351
Let's snub him starting tomorrow.

52:26.685 --> 52:29.479
Mitsuru, you've been promoted.

52:30.313 --> 52:32.774
Takeuchi has been acting bossy lately.

52:32.858 --> 52:34.109
I hate him.

52:34.901 --> 52:36.486
We don't need him.

52:38.655 --> 52:41.491
Hey! Move or we'll break your fingers!

52:44.578 --> 52:45.620
Well...

52:46.413 --> 52:48.123
My tire is flat.

52:48.206 --> 52:49.457
-What?
-What?

52:52.002 --> 52:54.254
Then get on mine.

52:54.337 --> 52:55.463
Get a move on.

53:14.691 --> 53:17.444
Hurry up!

53:17.944 --> 53:20.155
Not ramen, Chinese noodles!

53:20.238 --> 53:22.324
-I want soba noodles!
-Shut up!

53:22.407 --> 53:23.909
Not rameen, it's ramen.

53:23.992 --> 53:27.370
-Piss off!
-Piss off!

53:27.579 --> 53:29.539
I'm Yashiki!

53:29.623 --> 53:31.541
Yutaka Takagi is better!

53:31.625 --> 53:33.710
Nobody beats Fukumoto!

53:33.793 --> 53:36.254
Cromartie! Leon Lee!

53:36.338 --> 53:40.091
-All right! We made it!
-Okay!

53:40.175 --> 53:41.885
-Hey!
-Hey!

53:41.968 --> 53:44.429
Okay, come over here.

53:44.512 --> 53:46.348
Here. Right here.

53:46.431 --> 53:48.516
-Shall we?
-Stop, and get off.

53:49.309 --> 53:51.019
-Okay.
-What are you doing?

53:54.022 --> 53:55.065
Take this camera.

53:55.649 --> 53:56.816
A camera?

53:57.275 --> 53:59.194
The toilets here are haunted.

54:00.987 --> 54:02.822
So get a ghost on film.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.159
-What?
-Shut up.

54:06.242 --> 54:08.536
It's for a ghost photo contest.

54:09.037 --> 54:12.832
The prize money is 50,000 yen.
You can have 50 yen.

54:13.166 --> 54:14.459
You get 50 yen!

54:15.085 --> 54:17.796
We'll go ahead to World.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.548
Come when you get the photo.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.635
If you run, we'll smash your faces in.

54:23.718 --> 54:25.804
Don't be scared!

54:26.137 --> 54:29.975
-But this doesn't have a flash.
-So what?

54:30.433 --> 54:33.520
You don't need a flash to shoot a ghost.

54:33.687 --> 54:35.480
Think, dummy.

54:35.939 --> 54:38.274
You've got a problem with that?

54:38.400 --> 54:39.275
What?

54:39.401 --> 54:42.570
-Go on!
-Get to it!

54:43.446 --> 54:44.739
Go all the way!

54:45.156 --> 54:47.409
Come on!

54:47.492 --> 54:49.160
Hey!

54:49.244 --> 54:51.621
Yes!

54:54.290 --> 54:57.585
So what should we do?

54:58.837 --> 55:01.881
What do you think? We've got to do it.

55:14.853 --> 55:18.106
Mitsuru, tell us a joke.

55:18.773 --> 55:20.275
A joke?

55:21.776 --> 55:22.944
I don't know any.

55:23.028 --> 55:25.613
Anything is fine,
just say something funny!

55:26.573 --> 55:31.077
The other day,
when I was playing with myself,

55:31.911 --> 55:33.788
my dad caught me!

55:33.872 --> 55:37.208
What? That isn't funny at all.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.502
My mom caught me once.

55:40.378 --> 55:43.089
And don't say "playing with myself."

55:43.548 --> 55:44.924
It's embarrassing.

55:45.425 --> 55:47.761
So what should I say?

55:48.094 --> 55:50.388
I don't know. Think about it!

55:51.723 --> 55:54.559
-Masturbate?
-That's even worse, dipshit!

55:56.644 --> 56:00.315
Do you think it's worse
getting caught by your parents

56:00.982 --> 56:04.277
or catching your parents doing it?

56:05.028 --> 56:06.029
What?

56:08.740 --> 56:12.827
"Catching your parents?"
Adults don't do that.

56:14.996 --> 56:16.456
Your parents do it?

56:16.790 --> 56:18.750
Well... No.

56:18.833 --> 56:21.294
I heard about it on the radio.

56:22.587 --> 56:26.508
Actually, the worst time
was when Grandma caught me.

56:26.966 --> 56:28.760
A grandma is no big deal.

56:29.803 --> 56:31.763
This conversation is really boring.

56:32.138 --> 56:33.848
Change the subject, Mitsuru.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.558
I've got nothing.

56:36.017 --> 56:38.353
Anything is fine.
Hurry up and say something.

56:39.521 --> 56:40.855
I've got nothing.

56:51.282 --> 56:52.951
Then sing something.

56:53.034 --> 56:56.037
No way. I can't sing.

56:59.332 --> 57:00.500
Is that it?

57:03.002 --> 57:05.130
Mitsuru, go do it.

57:05.505 --> 57:06.714
I can't.

57:06.798 --> 57:08.424
-Go!
-I really can't!

57:08.508 --> 57:10.593
-Go, dammit!
-I can't.

57:10.677 --> 57:11.803
I really can't go.

57:11.886 --> 57:13.555
Then do it from here.

57:14.013 --> 57:15.181
You do it, Takashi.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.918
This isn't going to work without a flash.

57:44.335 --> 57:46.296
Try to get closer.

57:46.671 --> 57:49.591
What? Why don't you do it?

57:49.841 --> 57:51.593
-Go, Mitsuru.
-No!

57:51.801 --> 57:53.636
-Get going!
-I really can't!

57:53.720 --> 57:57.932
-Let's all go together!
-Go, damn it!

57:59.058 --> 58:00.226
Somebody is there!

58:08.985 --> 58:10.487
-What?
-Understand?

58:11.279 --> 58:15.909
Even I graduated from university.
It's true.

58:16.326 --> 58:18.828
It was a national university.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.371
Tit grab!

58:21.831 --> 58:26.002
If you don't study,
your future is a gas station...

58:26.085 --> 58:27.128
What was that for?

58:28.046 --> 58:29.047
Tit grab.

58:31.549 --> 58:33.343
What was that for?

58:34.177 --> 58:37.680
You know, if you won't go to university,

58:37.764 --> 58:38.890
go to Koshien.

58:39.390 --> 58:41.809
Koshien would be good.

58:43.978 --> 58:46.105
<i>When compared with Mitsuru's father,</i>

58:46.773 --> 58:49.150
<i>my dad didn't seem nearly as bad.</i>

58:50.109 --> 58:51.903
<i>He was nowhere near as bad.</i>

58:57.075 --> 58:59.410
If we take a photo of them,

59:00.578 --> 59:02.872
they might look like ghosts.

59:24.102 --> 59:28.273
It probably won't come out.

59:49.544 --> 59:50.670
Come on.

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:23.661
Hey.

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:26.581
I'm going home.

1:00:27.874 --> 1:00:29.292
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:57.987
Let's tell Takeuchi

1:00:58.071 --> 1:01:00.073
we sucked Yokushimaru's boobs.

1:01:00.573 --> 1:01:03.451
Then we'll snub him and call him Meathead.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:29.018
What are we going to do?

1:01:30.478 --> 1:01:31.604
From now?

1:01:35.233 --> 1:01:36.484
About what?

1:01:39.153 --> 1:01:41.906
Do we go home?

1:01:47.036 --> 1:01:48.287
What do you want to do?

1:01:53.084 --> 1:01:55.211
Kyoko Yokushimaru?

1:01:57.755 --> 1:01:59.048
You want to go?

1:02:03.177 --> 1:02:04.178
No.

1:02:05.763 --> 1:02:07.598
Let's go somewhere better.

1:02:10.226 --> 1:02:11.310
Like where?

1:02:15.732 --> 1:02:18.025
Follow me.

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:24.073
Hey!

1:02:24.949 --> 1:02:26.367
Wait a minute!

1:02:31.205 --> 1:02:34.000
Take a right here.

1:02:51.434 --> 1:02:52.685
Hey, Mitsuru?

1:02:55.104 --> 1:02:56.022
What is it?

1:02:59.108 --> 1:03:02.570
I'm sorry for asking you this directly.

1:03:07.909 --> 1:03:09.452
Do you enjoy life?

1:03:11.871 --> 1:03:12.997
I mean...

1:03:14.165 --> 1:03:15.416
Think about it.

1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:20.421
You always get wrestling moves put on you

1:03:21.422 --> 1:03:23.049
and forced to do stuff.

1:03:25.009 --> 1:03:28.054
Don't you feel frustrated?

1:03:30.223 --> 1:03:31.390
I don't.

1:03:33.643 --> 1:03:36.562
Have you got some hidden talent?

1:03:36.646 --> 1:03:39.398
You know, like Noda makes movies.

1:03:40.233 --> 1:03:41.442
I don't.

1:03:43.069 --> 1:03:44.403
Seriously?

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:49.158
If you did, I'd give you a brainbuster.

1:03:49.534 --> 1:03:50.827
I really don't.

1:03:54.330 --> 1:03:58.334
But I've started boxing recently.

1:03:58.417 --> 1:03:59.502
What?

1:04:00.419 --> 1:04:03.256
My dad did boxing.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.217
He beat Yoko Gushiken.

1:04:08.344 --> 1:04:09.846
Are you kidding me?

1:04:10.847 --> 1:04:12.139
He would never beat him.

1:04:15.643 --> 1:04:19.188
Do you have something, Oyama?

1:04:20.231 --> 1:04:21.399
A hidden talent.

1:04:25.736 --> 1:04:27.613
No. Nothing.

1:04:28.823 --> 1:04:32.493
But don't you want to be
the next Jackie Chan?

1:04:32.577 --> 1:04:33.619
What?

1:04:37.373 --> 1:04:39.542
Your elementary school graduation essay.

1:04:39.834 --> 1:04:41.711
Don't read it, dipshit!

1:04:44.589 --> 1:04:46.007
You take over.

1:04:47.341 --> 1:04:48.426
Sure.

1:05:04.609 --> 1:05:06.277
What did you write?

1:05:07.737 --> 1:05:10.698
-For what?
-Your graduation essay.

1:05:11.741 --> 1:05:13.367
Hikaru Genji.

1:05:17.121 --> 1:05:18.456
What the hell?

1:05:20.458 --> 1:05:22.919
Yoshioka and his guys made me.

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:29.926
He was really scary back then.

1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:35.389
He told me to write about
Hikaru Genji or Kōji Kikkawa.

1:05:39.143 --> 1:05:44.899
Yoshioka is totally
one of Kaneda's guys now.

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:48.778
Oyama?

1:05:51.197 --> 1:05:52.657
You were friends, right?

1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:55.993
You and Yoshioka.

1:05:57.578 --> 1:05:58.913
In elementary school.

1:06:01.582 --> 1:06:03.376
Not really.

1:06:11.634 --> 1:06:12.885
You know,

1:06:14.053 --> 1:06:17.473
we've never talked like this before.

1:06:17.556 --> 1:06:20.142
We did once in elementary school.

1:06:21.018 --> 1:06:25.022
On our third-year trip to Ohirayama.

1:06:25.856 --> 1:06:27.525
We went to the toilet.

1:06:28.275 --> 1:06:31.445
-You told me to come.
-I don't remember.

1:06:31.737 --> 1:06:33.447
You don't?

1:06:34.490 --> 1:06:38.160
One of the girls shat her pants.

1:06:38.244 --> 1:06:39.328
Shit?

1:06:39.704 --> 1:06:43.499
So you said you would wash them for her.

1:06:43.833 --> 1:06:45.251
Oh, right.

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:49.672
You remember that?

1:06:51.590 --> 1:06:53.467
I thought that was cool.

1:06:54.802 --> 1:06:56.220
You were cool.

1:07:18.743 --> 1:07:19.702
Here?

1:07:28.377 --> 1:07:29.462
It's here.

1:07:31.213 --> 1:07:32.465
What is this?

1:07:40.514 --> 1:07:41.557
Come on.

1:07:46.437 --> 1:07:47.396
Hey!

1:08:16.050 --> 1:08:17.134
Hey.

1:08:21.388 --> 1:08:22.973
What are you doing?

1:08:41.617 --> 1:08:42.868
What are you doing?

1:08:45.621 --> 1:08:46.789
They're doing it.

1:08:47.456 --> 1:08:48.457
What?

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:50.960
They're boning.

1:09:09.103 --> 1:09:10.437
Hey!

1:09:50.311 --> 1:09:54.607
Do you come here to peek a lot?

1:09:56.025 --> 1:09:57.359
Sometimes.

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:00.321
No way.

1:10:12.166 --> 1:10:13.375
They're doing it.

1:10:51.247 --> 1:10:52.248
Hey.

1:10:54.708 --> 1:10:55.709
Hey!

1:10:58.963 --> 1:11:01.757
That's the wrong one.

1:11:04.593 --> 1:11:06.262
That's mine.

1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:09.473
That's yours.

1:11:22.278 --> 1:11:23.529
Knock it off.

1:11:30.077 --> 1:11:31.453
Knock it off!

1:11:40.212 --> 1:11:41.797
Knock it off, damn it!

1:12:00.107 --> 1:12:01.525
I'm going.

1:12:09.867 --> 1:12:11.201
What are you doing?

1:12:13.704 --> 1:12:14.788
Move!

1:12:22.713 --> 1:12:24.298
Move, damn it!

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:32.681
What the hell?

1:13:05.756 --> 1:13:07.549
Lick it.

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:10.928
What?

1:13:12.388 --> 1:13:14.932
Just a little is fine.

1:16:51.815 --> 1:16:53.400
Hey, kid!

1:16:54.026 --> 1:16:55.027
Hey!

1:16:56.570 --> 1:16:57.821
Come here.

1:17:04.995 --> 1:17:06.288
Hang on.

1:17:11.335 --> 1:17:13.128
Do you want to eat this?

1:17:15.088 --> 1:17:17.716
Just eat it. It's on me.

1:17:19.885 --> 1:17:21.261
Thank you.

1:17:23.722 --> 1:17:25.223
What happened to you?

1:17:25.766 --> 1:17:28.185
You look like the world's ending.

1:17:35.025 --> 1:17:36.109
Is it good?

1:17:39.196 --> 1:17:40.197
Yes.

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:41.782
Of course, it is.

1:17:42.616 --> 1:17:44.493
It's cat meat.

1:17:46.244 --> 1:17:47.245
What?

1:17:48.914 --> 1:17:50.374
I'm joking, idiot!

1:17:51.041 --> 1:17:54.211
Well, the truth is more surprising.

1:17:55.170 --> 1:17:59.591
Come on. Sit and eat. Relax.

1:18:15.691 --> 1:18:18.694
But Japan is on its last leg too.

1:18:19.986 --> 1:18:24.074
A girl as cute as this has to get naked?

1:18:25.367 --> 1:18:26.660
What do you think, kid?

1:18:27.452 --> 1:18:29.079
-What?
-Take a look.

1:18:32.290 --> 1:18:35.085
"My pinched nipples feel divine."

1:18:36.002 --> 1:18:37.879
"I'll blast off into space."

1:18:47.472 --> 1:18:50.100
I'd like to enter her space.

1:18:54.521 --> 1:18:58.233
But my moves would take her
further than just space.

1:18:59.109 --> 1:19:01.027
How about Saturn?

1:19:01.653 --> 1:19:02.612
Yes.

1:19:03.155 --> 1:19:04.322
-No doubt.
-Sorry.

1:19:06.199 --> 1:19:09.578
-What time is it?
-What? The time?

1:19:10.203 --> 1:19:12.539
I don't have a clock at my shop.

1:19:12.622 --> 1:19:13.665
Thank you.

1:19:14.207 --> 1:19:16.293
Hey, kid!

1:19:16.376 --> 1:19:17.210
Hey!

1:20:08.094 --> 1:20:09.387
I CAME IN HEAVEN

1:20:19.648 --> 1:20:22.400
YOKUSHIMARU IS COMING TO WORLD
ON AUGUST 4TH

1:21:13.535 --> 1:21:14.744
That hurts!

1:21:17.414 --> 1:21:18.832
No pain!

1:22:09.925 --> 1:22:11.051
Welcome...

1:22:54.970 --> 1:22:57.347
The signing session?

1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:00.141
What?

1:23:05.605 --> 1:23:09.651
Kyoko Yokushimaru's
autograph signing session.

1:23:10.443 --> 1:23:11.444
Today.

1:23:12.487 --> 1:23:13.989
It's here, today.

1:23:14.531 --> 1:23:15.740
What's that?

1:23:16.491 --> 1:23:18.118
Who told you that?

1:23:26.584 --> 1:23:28.628
You came for her autograph?

1:23:32.424 --> 1:23:34.175
You've been tricked.

1:23:52.277 --> 1:23:53.445
Wait a minute.

1:23:55.238 --> 1:23:56.990
You came in this afternoon.

1:23:58.908 --> 1:24:01.244
You rented a dirty movie.

1:24:01.828 --> 1:24:03.413
You and your wussy friends.

1:24:09.961 --> 1:24:11.129
How was it?

1:24:13.339 --> 1:24:14.299
What?

1:24:15.675 --> 1:24:16.885
Did you get off?

1:24:21.264 --> 1:24:22.348
No.

1:24:26.269 --> 1:24:27.520
Come here.

1:24:28.813 --> 1:24:29.773
What?

1:24:30.648 --> 1:24:32.317
I said, come here.

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:33.943
I won't bite.

1:24:43.870 --> 1:24:45.705
Hold out your hand.

1:25:08.311 --> 1:25:09.395
Come on.

1:25:11.022 --> 1:25:12.398
Just squeeze.

1:25:20.031 --> 1:25:21.074
Come on.

1:25:37.215 --> 1:25:38.591
Squeeze harder.

1:26:12.667 --> 1:26:16.796
<i>Actually, that was just a horny fantasy.</i>

1:26:17.505 --> 1:26:18.631
<i>In reality...</i>

1:26:54.083 --> 1:26:55.168
Take it.

1:26:56.044 --> 1:26:57.503
It's pirated anyway.

1:27:01.716 --> 1:27:04.844
You know, I was an idol in Tokyo.

1:27:06.804 --> 1:27:08.223
I never got popular, though.

1:27:08.890 --> 1:27:11.100
Have you heard of me? Hiroko Okuda.

1:27:15.605 --> 1:27:16.564
No.

1:27:18.816 --> 1:27:21.069
I outdid Maiko Okamoto.

1:27:28.117 --> 1:27:29.077
Well...

1:27:31.829 --> 1:27:32.914
This.

1:27:36.793 --> 1:27:38.086
Thank you.

1:28:06.698 --> 1:28:08.741
Hold up!

1:28:09.450 --> 1:28:11.619
You're in the way!

1:28:11.703 --> 1:28:14.080
-Is that so?
-You are!

1:28:14.163 --> 1:28:15.456
Hey, Takashi!

1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:17.834
-Hey, Takashi!
-Where's Mitsuru?

1:28:17.917 --> 1:28:21.921
-Where are your friends?
-What about Meathead?

1:28:22.463 --> 1:28:24.215
Meathead didn't come?

1:28:25.508 --> 1:28:27.385
Hey, what's with your face?

1:28:27.468 --> 1:28:29.095
-You're a bloody mess.
-What's that?

1:28:29.178 --> 1:28:30.888
-What happened?
-You okay?

1:28:31.681 --> 1:28:34.100
Oh, right. Did you get that photo?

1:28:34.517 --> 1:28:35.518
I did.

1:28:36.811 --> 1:28:38.229
-Nice.
-Nice.

1:28:38.313 --> 1:28:39.355
More or less.

1:28:39.439 --> 1:28:41.733
All right. Thanks.

1:28:42.025 --> 1:28:44.902
-We'll check your work later.
-And this?

1:28:44.986 --> 1:28:46.112
What is it?

1:28:46.529 --> 1:28:47.447
-Well...
-Well?

1:28:47.530 --> 1:28:48.489
What is that?

1:28:49.991 --> 1:28:51.701
-What?
-Really?

1:28:51.784 --> 1:28:54.078
The Yokushimaru
autograph signing was real?

1:28:54.787 --> 1:28:56.205
We didn't see anything!

1:28:56.289 --> 1:28:59.250
-Did you even check?
-I had a good look!

1:28:59.334 --> 1:29:01.586
Wait a minute. Did you?

1:29:02.253 --> 1:29:04.505
Did you suck on her tits?

1:29:05.089 --> 1:29:06.632
-Her tits.
-Tits.

1:29:08.843 --> 1:29:10.803
-Well...
-Well?

1:29:11.637 --> 1:29:12.555
Yes.

1:29:12.638 --> 1:29:13.848
No way!

1:29:13.931 --> 1:29:16.059
-Come on!
-Let's go!

1:29:16.142 --> 1:29:18.603
-Let's go!
-Hey! Wait a minute!

1:29:18.686 --> 1:29:20.188
-What is it?
-Well...

1:29:21.773 --> 1:29:23.608
I was the last one.

1:29:23.983 --> 1:29:25.610
-What?
-She's gone already.

1:29:26.194 --> 1:29:27.820
What?

1:29:27.904 --> 1:29:30.239
-What the hell?
-What the hell?

1:29:30.656 --> 1:29:32.825
Hey! How did her tits taste?

1:29:32.909 --> 1:29:37.497
-Well?
-The taste! Tell us, damn it!

1:29:37.580 --> 1:29:40.875
Oh, the taste.

1:29:40.958 --> 1:29:43.002
Like Chelsea.

1:29:43.086 --> 1:29:45.254
-Chelsea?
-Chelsea?

1:29:45.338 --> 1:29:47.173
-Chelsea!
-No way!

1:29:47.256 --> 1:29:48.841
Damn right!

1:29:48.925 --> 1:29:52.178
-Come on!
-They're sweet! Damn it!

1:30:01.395 --> 1:30:02.855
They're coming.

1:30:04.315 --> 1:30:06.025
They're coming here.

1:30:48.776 --> 1:30:50.820
Hey!

1:31:03.207 --> 1:31:04.959
Look at this!

1:31:05.084 --> 1:31:08.254
What are junior high kids
doing out here so late?

1:31:08.337 --> 1:31:10.339
What time is your curfew?

1:31:10.798 --> 1:31:12.967
I bet it's 5:00 p.m.

1:31:13.050 --> 1:31:14.594
Which junior high school?

1:31:15.178 --> 1:31:18.764
-If it's West, you're dead!
-Or if it's East!

1:31:19.765 --> 1:31:22.059
-Kawakita!
-Never heard of it!

1:31:22.310 --> 1:31:23.519
Year and class?

1:31:24.478 --> 1:31:25.563
Third year, class one!

1:31:25.646 --> 1:31:26.772
-And you?
-Third year, class two!

1:31:26.856 --> 1:31:28.149
-And you?
-Third year, class three!

1:31:28.232 --> 1:31:30.443
-Okay!
-What are you looking at?

1:31:36.782 --> 1:31:40.244
Hey, you. You were looking at Megumi.

1:31:41.162 --> 1:31:43.122
The penalty is 100,000 yen, so pay up.

1:31:43.956 --> 1:31:45.166
Now!

1:31:56.802 --> 1:32:00.306
What? What the hell is wrong with you?

1:32:00.389 --> 1:32:01.766
Are you sick?

1:32:03.100 --> 1:32:06.103
Bladder catarrh? Nocturnal enuresis?

1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:09.357
What a loser.

1:32:10.608 --> 1:32:11.734
How pathetic.

1:32:11.859 --> 1:32:12.985
Leave him alone.

1:32:14.820 --> 1:32:16.405
You're lucky, kid.

1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:19.867
Your old playmate is here.

1:32:21.410 --> 1:32:23.246
You're "Piss-Pants Taka."

1:32:24.872 --> 1:32:27.875
You've been like that
since nursery school!

1:32:29.418 --> 1:32:30.586
What a loser!

1:32:31.045 --> 1:32:32.880
"Piss-Pants!"

1:32:32.964 --> 1:32:35.299
-Hey, pay up.
-Pay up.

1:32:35.716 --> 1:32:38.511
No bills smaller than 5,000 yen.

1:32:39.053 --> 1:32:40.846
What do we have here?

1:32:40.930 --> 1:32:43.057
-What the hell?
-Spill it.

1:32:43.140 --> 1:32:44.725
Not even a 10,000 yen bill.

1:32:44.809 --> 1:32:46.519
Don't you have a stack?

1:32:47.103 --> 1:32:48.104
Thanks.

1:32:49.772 --> 1:32:52.149
-He's flat broke.
-Oh, well.

1:32:55.361 --> 1:32:59.073
You better hurry home!
Your moms will be worried.

1:33:01.575 --> 1:33:03.619
That's rich coming from you,
"Shit-Pants Megumi!"

1:33:12.086 --> 1:33:13.379
You...

1:33:14.630 --> 1:33:16.757
shit your pants on that school trip.

1:33:19.302 --> 1:33:21.887
Remember who washed them for you?

1:33:27.810 --> 1:33:30.104
Do you know how bad they stunk?

1:33:30.604 --> 1:33:34.275
You should apologize

1:33:34.775 --> 1:33:37.653
by letting me feel your big tits!

1:33:51.125 --> 1:33:52.209
Hey, kid.

1:33:52.752 --> 1:33:54.587
Did fear drive you crazy?

1:33:57.673 --> 1:34:01.802
I...

1:34:06.349 --> 1:34:08.225
He isn't crazy!

1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:24.241
What?

1:34:25.201 --> 1:34:26.619
You want to feel them?

1:34:29.705 --> 1:34:30.873
I...

1:34:30.956 --> 1:34:32.416
Spit it out!

1:34:34.210 --> 1:34:37.046
Then feel them! Fucking do it!

1:34:41.842 --> 1:34:44.595
I can't...

1:34:47.056 --> 1:34:48.974
You're pathetic.

1:34:50.851 --> 1:34:53.687
There was only one time you weren't.

1:34:58.609 --> 1:35:00.820
Scary.

1:35:04.448 --> 1:35:05.866
Go for it, Takashi!

1:35:41.569 --> 1:35:42.695
Come on.

1:36:11.474 --> 1:36:12.933
Feel her up!

1:36:22.485 --> 1:36:23.736
Come here!

1:36:23.986 --> 1:36:25.404
Go for it!

1:36:36.081 --> 1:36:39.585
Takashi! Come on!

1:36:39.668 --> 1:36:41.504
Takashi!

1:38:01.417 --> 1:38:03.502
Your face is messed up.

1:38:04.044 --> 1:38:05.170
Kaneda?

1:38:06.046 --> 1:38:07.548
Well, so is mine.

1:38:12.303 --> 1:38:14.263
You've got some balls on you.

1:38:18.392 --> 1:38:20.644
You nearly touched Megumi's tits.

1:38:23.439 --> 1:38:27.026
I guarded Kyoko Yokushimaru for you.

1:38:36.535 --> 1:38:38.621
Maybe Megumi likes you.

1:38:42.625 --> 1:38:43.834
No, not a chance.

1:38:46.503 --> 1:38:48.631
I can't figure chicks out.

1:38:52.593 --> 1:38:53.636
That hurts.

1:38:58.182 --> 1:39:01.352
Do you want to swim?
There's no time like the present.

1:39:09.109 --> 1:39:11.862
What are you looking at? Strip off.

1:39:45.688 --> 1:39:48.732
This feels good.

1:40:07.876 --> 1:40:09.962
What the hell, man? Get in.

1:40:10.379 --> 1:40:12.423
Come on, get in!

1:40:13.298 --> 1:40:15.092
Don't be a pussy! Get in.

1:40:15.926 --> 1:40:16.844
Hey!

1:42:04.076 --> 1:42:07.287
What happened to your face?

1:42:09.915 --> 1:42:11.083
Where were you?

1:42:12.709 --> 1:42:16.296
Nowhere. I just fell over
when I was running.

1:42:17.631 --> 1:42:19.383
You fell over?

1:42:20.926 --> 1:42:24.137
Why are you washing that? It's not ours.

1:42:24.555 --> 1:42:25.639
What?

1:42:26.974 --> 1:42:29.309
Well, you see...

1:42:31.061 --> 1:42:32.729
It was dirty.

1:42:33.605 --> 1:42:34.690
What?

1:42:37.734 --> 1:42:39.236
So I'm washing it!

1:42:50.747 --> 1:42:52.332
Takashi.

1:42:57.880 --> 1:42:58.964
What?

1:43:08.307 --> 1:43:09.516
Am I

1:43:12.102 --> 1:43:13.270
pathetic?

1:43:16.189 --> 1:43:17.316
What?

1:43:21.528 --> 1:43:22.696
Of course, you are.

1:43:30.954 --> 1:43:32.164
You're pathetic.

1:43:34.207 --> 1:43:35.918
Really pathetic.

1:43:45.719 --> 1:43:46.762
But...

1:43:51.391 --> 1:43:53.143
I wish you were cool.

1:44:03.654 --> 1:44:04.821
I wish

1:44:06.031 --> 1:44:07.449
I was cool too.

1:44:16.375 --> 1:44:18.001
Wait! Hey!

1:44:27.886 --> 1:44:32.140
You're not pathetic because of me.

1:44:40.649 --> 1:44:42.192
It's your own fault.

1:44:49.658 --> 1:44:54.371
Dad! Why are you washing his car?

1:44:54.454 --> 1:44:55.998
Mr. Oyama, I'll do that!

1:44:56.081 --> 1:44:58.750
It's all wet. Who asked you to?

1:44:58.834 --> 1:45:00.377
Leave it. I'll wash it.

1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:03.422
Why? Who asked you to?

1:45:03.505 --> 1:45:06.842
Get Mom to help if you insist on doing it.

1:45:06.967 --> 1:45:08.677
I'll take over.

1:45:12.597 --> 1:45:15.726
Hey! What happened to your face?

1:45:19.521 --> 1:45:21.273
Were you in a fight?

1:45:21.898 --> 1:45:24.443
Did you fall over? What happened?

1:45:27.571 --> 1:45:29.281
Dad is acting weird again.

1:45:36.872 --> 1:45:38.081
Stop splashing!

1:45:38.165 --> 1:45:40.417
This whole area is wet!

1:45:40.500 --> 1:45:41.793
It's clean now.

1:45:41.877 --> 1:45:43.003
Look out.

1:45:43.086 --> 1:45:45.505
-Look out!
-You'll get wet.

1:45:45.589 --> 1:45:47.049
Dad, stop it.

1:45:47.132 --> 1:45:48.759
Why are you so stubborn?

1:45:48.842 --> 1:45:50.010
It's clean now.

1:45:50.093 --> 1:45:53.847
Washing a car without permission
is almost a crime.

1:45:53.930 --> 1:45:56.892
But it'll rain tomorrow morning.

1:45:56.975 --> 1:45:59.978
Dad, you never wash your car.

1:46:00.062 --> 1:46:02.064
Get Mom to help you.

1:46:02.147 --> 1:46:03.690
You'll get wet!

1:46:03.774 --> 1:46:07.235
You never do this. Why are you doing this?

1:46:07.319 --> 1:46:10.322
It's clean now. You can stop, sir.

1:46:10.405 --> 1:46:13.617
When are you going to stop?
This is a pain in the ass.

1:46:13.700 --> 1:46:16.661
Oh, Dad, give it a rest.

1:46:17.412 --> 1:46:22.375
-Mr. Oyama.
-Dad, you really shouldn't do this.

1:46:22.459 --> 1:46:24.002
That window.

1:46:24.086 --> 1:46:25.629
I'll wash that window.

1:46:25.712 --> 1:46:27.255
That's enough, sir!

1:46:27.339 --> 1:46:28.757
I'll do it!

1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:32.469
He just had the car washed.

1:46:32.552 --> 1:46:35.347
So leave it, please.

1:46:35.430 --> 1:46:37.057
-Mr. Oyama.
-Dad!

1:46:37.140 --> 1:46:39.601
Dad! What are you doing?

1:46:39.684 --> 1:46:41.186
Mom, talk him out of it.

1:46:41.269 --> 1:46:43.188
We told him to stop, but he wouldn't.

1:46:43.271 --> 1:46:46.608
Stop it! Don't touch that!

1:46:55.367 --> 1:46:56.576
Okay.

1:46:56.660 --> 1:46:58.954
Is this to make up for yesterday?

1:46:59.037 --> 1:47:01.206
Well, it's not enough!

1:47:01.289 --> 1:47:04.918
Just let me wash the car!

1:47:05.836 --> 1:47:08.797
Why do I have to shout like this?

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:11.967
I'm cutting ties with you!

1:47:13.093 --> 1:47:14.469
Haru?

1:47:22.269 --> 1:47:26.731
You want to wash it?
Then go ahead. Wash it, dear.

1:47:26.815 --> 1:47:28.984
I'll help, sir.

1:47:34.865 --> 1:47:37.409
It's a dustcloth.

1:47:46.501 --> 1:47:47.627
I mean it, Dad!

1:47:50.630 --> 1:47:51.840
Let me wash it!

1:48:49.064 --> 1:48:54.402
AUGUST 5TH, 1987 6:23 A.M.

1:53:06.946 --> 1:53:07.947
What?

1:53:11.242 --> 1:53:15.705
So that's where the camera was.
