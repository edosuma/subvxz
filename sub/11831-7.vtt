I-I saw a client who's,
you know, a lady of the evening.

00:07.004 --> 00:10.006
I drove her home.
I gave her money
'cause she was broke.

Then she started rubbin' me, and
the police suddenly showed up.
I'm completely innocent.

You don't know me,

Really? Tell me about yourself.

You don't wanna give Dickie boy
the chance to go after you.

You crossed the line, Dickie.
You coerced that girl.

What the hell is your interest
in this, Helen?

00:39.223 --> 00:41.591
I don't like it.
Let it go.

00:41.658 --> 00:44.092

The big deal.
The big deal?

00:44.159 --> 00:45.993
Shh. Come on.
You drugged me.

00:46.060 --> 00:48.262
You slipped an illegal drug
into my wine without telling me.

00:48.329 --> 00:52.197
You then sleep with me
while I'm under the influence.
The big deal is called rape.

00:52.264 --> 00:55.033
The other night,
I kind of had this erotic dream.

00:55.099 --> 00:58.768
We were both naked.
And you were...

00:58.835 --> 01:00.569
very rigorous.

01:00.636 --> 01:02.503
Oh.

01:07.406 --> 01:09.374

Yeah.

01:09.441 --> 01:11.508
This is really
none of my business,

01:11.575 --> 01:14.144
but remember your
big murder trial where
you turned rat against counsel?

01:14.210 --> 01:16.111
Andrea Wexler?
We had a conflict of interest.

01:16.178 --> 01:18.479
I don't think of it
as "turning rat."

01:18.547 --> 01:21.581
You used to be romantically
involved with her, right?

01:21.648 --> 01:26.317

She was acquitted.
And why are you
asking me this?

01:33.421 --> 01:36.023

It's just something's come up.

You just say it, Helen.

She caught me off guard.

Well, Bobby, she's against

She is, but-but that doesn't
mean you should sleep with her.

Lindsay, I'm trying

You're going into court

You're such a feminist.

It isn't that.
It's just ordering a surgery

Don't you think if a woman
agrees to incubate a child,

I never bought into that
"my body, my rights" stuff.
Not completely.

12:58.927 --> 13:01.596
I mean, if a person wants
total dominion over her body,

13:01.663 --> 13:04.665

Ordinarily, yes.
But the circumstances

Mrs. Randall is incompetent

- No, she's competent.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.447

own record,

we had a reasonable suspicion
that a drug transaction
could be in progress.

Well, we continued
our surveillance.

Did you see an exchange of money
between my client and this man

No. We think the transaction
was aborted due to

22:02.917 --> 22:04.918
Do you like defending
these creeps?

22:04.985 --> 22:08.620
No. But defending
the drug creeps
is just, you know,

22:08.687 --> 22:12.555
the bread and butter that pays
the rent and that allows us
to do the more important cases.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.591
You mean the murderers?

22:14.657 --> 22:17.525
Exactly.

22:17.592 --> 22:19.527
God.

22:20.894 --> 22:23.729
It's funny when you think
about how we ended up.

22:23.796 --> 22:27.198
I mean, in college,
you were always
the stone crusher.

We don't want liberal.
We want Bible Belt.

<i>Yes, it's awful</i>

24:54.852 --> 24:59.388

I appreciate that.

Why do you handle
such jerks?

25:13.196 --> 25:17.799
It's her body. Her right.
But the right isn't absolute.

25:17.865 --> 25:19.733
Third trimester abortions
are illegal.

25:19.800 --> 25:23.836
So at some point,
the government does legislate
dominion over a woman's body.

25:23.903 --> 25:29.206
A difference between prohibiting
abortion and ordering
intrusive major surgery--

25:29.272 --> 25:32.074
Calling it a fetus or unborn,
that helps, doesn't it?

25:32.141 --> 25:37.011
If you don't have to think
of him as a baby, a fetus
is a nice, clinical word.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.379

- Saving human life.

- Fundamental,
individual liberty.

Fine. But don't be claiming
unfair surprise when
I bring up the Fourth Amendment.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.698
Where was
the reasonable suspicion?
His criminal record?

26:12.765 --> 26:16.434
If so, the police automatically
have a right to suspect
anybody who has a conviction?

26:16.500 --> 26:19.269
It was two drug dealers talking.
Oh, right.
Who's the other guy?

26:19.336 --> 26:23.104
They couldn't come up with
a name, they didn't follow him.
They pursued Benny Small only.

26:23.171 --> 26:25.005
- <i>And he ran.</i>
- After they frisked him
for drugs.

26:25.072 --> 26:27.040
Mm-mmm. A weapon.
Right.

26:27.106 --> 26:30.042
Your Honor, the police saw
what they thought
to be criminal activity.

26:30.108 --> 26:33.177
They had a reasonable suspicion
that the suspect
might be armed and dangerous,

26:33.244 --> 26:35.645
and when they proceeded
to pat him down,
he took off.

26:35.711 --> 26:39.648
But I have to ask,
what was the initial
suspicion based on?

26:39.714 --> 26:41.282
Seeing him talk to somebody?

26:41.349 --> 26:43.450
Obviously, the suspicion...

26:43.516 --> 26:45.751
turned out to be reasonable
because it turned out
to be right.

26:45.817 --> 26:49.353
- He had drugs.
- Yes. As hunches go,
it was tremendous.

26:49.419 --> 26:53.489
<i>But as reasonable</i>
<i>suspicions go,</i>
<i>they didn't act legally.</i>

of narcotics on his person.

- Mr. Flood, I'm concerned.

27:00.926 --> 27:05.196
What did they see but
two people with drug histories
having a conversation?

27:05.263 --> 27:09.531
