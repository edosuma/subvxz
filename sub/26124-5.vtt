WEBVTT

00:36.030 --> 00:38.021
Tell you what,

00:38.120 --> 00:40.031
you free from acting today, right?

00:40.120 --> 00:41.496
Mmm-hmm.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.742
Let's you and I
go get something to eat.

00:46.170 --> 00:48.582
But not Leon's.

00:48.670 --> 00:51.969
I'm thinking something
more upscale, maybe...

00:52.840 --> 00:54.216
Maybe the Greek's.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.460
Okay.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.097
All right, then.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.057
Can't look good on camera
if you're all scrawny.

01:05.770 --> 01:06.759
Speaking of which,

01:07.310 --> 01:08.937
that female agent came to chat to me.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.181
Who? Kiki Raines?

01:12.780 --> 01:14.020
Hoo!

01:15.360 --> 01:18.272
I tell you, that bitch
got a nose for cash on her.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.492
One sniff of what we got
going on, and she wants in.

01:22.950 --> 01:23.951
What does that mean?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.610
It means she knows
she can't poach you,

01:25.710 --> 01:27.450
so she's willing
to take what she can get.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.530
I'm almost sorry for her.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.006
Why? What did she say?

01:35.090 --> 01:36.466
You and I proceed as is,

01:36.550 --> 01:39.212
but when she brings in a job,
she takes half her usual fee.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.597
I said I'd run it by you, but now

01:41.680 --> 01:43.216
I'm thinking, fuck it, let's do it.
You know?

01:43.390 --> 01:45.631
Let her tag along, as long
as there's money to be made.

01:47.310 --> 01:48.720
I met her once with Shana,

01:48.810 --> 01:51.108
and she seemed all right to me.

01:51.780 --> 01:52.974
Did she?

01:53.820 --> 01:55.196
Mmm-hmm.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.690
I'll get dressed so we can go.
I'm getting pretty hungry.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.657
This is one thing
I'm having a hard time with.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.537
She says she finds us a gig,

02:04.910 --> 02:06.707
I can't come to set with you no more.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.535
Seems that's how she do.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.450
You know?

02:12.550 --> 02:13.869
Clients go do their thing...

02:16.010 --> 02:17.966
Reps keep their distance.

02:19.550 --> 02:20.756
Hmm?

02:21.180 --> 02:22.636
Really?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.517
And she wouldn't make an exception?

02:25.140 --> 02:26.175
Nah.

02:26.270 --> 02:29.512
I mean, I'll put up with it for
the here-and-there shoots, but...

02:30.100 --> 02:31.727
I'm more concerned about you.

02:33.730 --> 02:35.732
You think you'd be
all right on your lonesome?

02:36.650 --> 02:40.609
If you're all right with it,
I think I could manage.

02:41.530 --> 02:43.578
I mean, it wouldn't be all the time.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.656
When I used to do street work,
I did it alone,

02:46.750 --> 02:49.867
so I guess it'd be
sort of like that, you know?

02:50.380 --> 02:52.496
Different business, same setup.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.909
Hmm.

02:56.670 --> 02:59.127
- You think I'm a fool?
- What?

03:00.510 --> 03:02.341
The two of you think you can play me?

03:03.850 --> 03:04.965
Hmm?

03:05.060 --> 03:07.016
- I don't know what you're...
- Okey-doke me?

03:07.350 --> 03:09.386
Like some fucking chump?

03:11.020 --> 03:12.396
She wants half?

03:15.110 --> 03:17.271
Well, she can have
the half that's bleeding.

04:57.710 --> 04:59.917
Why do you
go to the line every Friday?

05:00.130 --> 05:01.666
I have to hear this shit again?

05:01.840 --> 05:03.671
Why do you go
to the line every Friday?

05:04.050 --> 05:05.210
Well...

05:07.930 --> 05:09.215
BECBUSE the ﬁnance man

05:09.310 --> 05:11.881
is gonna be at your house
on Saturday, r/ght?

05:12.230 --> 05:13.970
Shit yeah.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.051
And that’s exactly
what the company wants.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.509
7'0 keep you on the line.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.601
They’// do anything
to keep you on their line.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.351
They pit the lifers
against the new boys,

05:22.440 --> 05:24.522
the old against the young,
the black against the white,

05:24.610 --> 05:26.521
everybody, to keep us in our place.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.019
I mean, can’t you understand that?

05:29.280 --> 05:31.236
So what am I supposed to do,
just not have a dance floor?

05:31.330 --> 05:33.366
I'm saying you just
install a normal floor,

05:33.580 --> 05:35.036
like what I wanted in the first place.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.247
Oh, normal. I'm not going for normal.

05:37.330 --> 05:40.242
Normal isn't why I had
striped blackwood tiles

05:40.340 --> 05:42.046
flown in from fucking Tanzania!

05:42.130 --> 05:43.415
Might have been helpful
to know they would

05:43.510 --> 05:44.750
shrink and crack in this climate

05:44.840 --> 05:46.330
before you blew the whole budget.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.922
Look, Paul, I get the vision, I do...

05:49.010 --> 05:50.591
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about this tonight.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.431
- So, how'd you do last night?
- Are you kidding me?

05:57.520 --> 05:58.680
- Yeah.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

05:58.770 --> 05:59.805
- Yeah.
- Are you pulling my leg?

05:59.900 --> 06:00.889
- So?
- So tits out to here, so.

06:02.150 --> 06:04.061
- Twenty, a couple years old.
- You gotta be fooling.

06:04.150 --> 06:05.139
- Nope.
- You devil.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.605
- You think she hadn't been around?
- Yeah.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.610
What?

06:10.700 --> 06:12.031
Nothing.

06:12.490 --> 06:15.038
Always with the long face.
It's only money, Bobby.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.957
It should buy me something, at least.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.496
You tipped me to a raid
that never happened.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.662
I shut down the parlors
for days, waiting.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.457
No one ever came.
I lost a ton of dough.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.086
What the fuck do you want out of me?

06:26.170 --> 06:27.967
I heard the raids were a go,
and then they weren't.

06:28.050 --> 06:30.041
What, are you complaining
because we didn't kick in your door?

06:30.140 --> 06:32.176
I just want some
reliable information, is all.

06:32.930 --> 06:34.636
Fuck you, buy me a drink.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.341
And not the piss
you pour into that bottle

06:37.440 --> 06:38.839
for the suit-and-tie johns.

06:39.310 --> 06:41.266
Real J.W. Black.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.957
That's why they're called
"life experience" credits.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.707
But if your final journal
is riddled with errors,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.542
misspellings, poor usage,

07:04.630 --> 07:06.450
sorry, Charlie, it's a do-over.

07:06.550 --> 07:07.539
Now, please note

07:07.630 --> 07:09.678
you'll be handing in pages
every week for review.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.888
Typewriters are available
for you on the first floor.

07:12.220 --> 07:13.346
They need to be...

07:13.850 --> 07:15.169
You came! I can't believe it.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.921
I thought you'd be too
occupied with the new place.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.419
I've been meaning to stop by the bar.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.932
No, you've been busy
with rehearsals, obviously.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.682
I mean, listen, you were great.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.567
- Incredible, really. Yeah.
- Yeah?

07:25.650 --> 07:27.026
Not bad for an understudy, right?

07:27.150 --> 07:28.560
I don't know how you do it.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.732
Well, it won't be for long.
We close next week.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.401
- Sucks.
- Yeah, just my luck.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.769
Look at this.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.439
You're a star.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.496
"I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. DeMille."

07:41.460 --> 07:45.203
All right. Put your clothes on,
let's go consume some alcohol.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.456
- Okay.
- Hey.

07:48.170 --> 07:52.334
"'Cause the finance man's gonna
be at your house on Saturday, right?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.847
"And that's exactly
what the company wants.

07:54.930 --> 07:55.999
"To be on their line.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.888
"Everybody stay on their line.

08:02.350 --> 08:06.389
"They pit the lifers
against the new boys,

08:06.860 --> 08:08.350
"the old against the young,

08:08.990 --> 08:12.107
"the black against the white.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.579
"Everybody put us in our place.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.651
"I mean...

08:19.750 --> 08:21.820
"Can't you understand that?

08:22.540 --> 08:24.280
"I mean...

08:24.380 --> 08:26.371
"Can't you understand that?

08:26.710 --> 08:29.008
"Can't you understand that, jack?"

08:29.090 --> 08:30.717
No, he didn't say "jack."

08:30.800 --> 08:32.836
"I mean, can't you understand that?"

08:39.020 --> 08:40.419
These clean?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.340
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Nah, I got it.

08:51.190 --> 08:53.693
What about these? You need these?

08:54.450 --> 08:55.815
Nah.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.070
So...

09:05.170 --> 09:06.535
You feel okay?

09:07.250 --> 09:08.376
Feelgood?

09:08.460 --> 09:09.620
I feel like shit.

09:09.710 --> 09:12.508
Yeah, no, of course.

09:12.670 --> 09:15.002
I mean, do you feel ready?

09:16.300 --> 09:17.506
Sure.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.306
Let's book this dump.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.478
I'm jonesing for White Castle.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.811
Dead. Left the business.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.810
LA.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.619
Junkie. Bitch.

09:38.070 --> 09:39.480
Jenny Cole's cute.

09:39.580 --> 09:43.152
She's got some of that
innocence you're looking for.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.325
No, I don't know.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.957
Serena would be fucking perfect.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.280
Her rate is really high now.

09:50.540 --> 09:51.837
Yeah.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.797
- Carol Connors.
- LA.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.086
Lori Madison.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.169
She's on her way up.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.797
- Yeah, I thought about Lori.
- But?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.556
No, she's in the running. Definitely.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.346
Look, I know you want big stars,

10:04.430 --> 10:07.228
but they can be a headache
and expensive.

10:07.310 --> 10:10.859
You're already saddled with
Lance Minx, God love you.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.601
Yeah, I think I can handle him.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.351
How about John Seeman...

10:14.440 --> 10:16.317
- For the Wolf?
- Would you fucking stop?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.777
I need a real actor in that role.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.485
So, what do you think?

10:20.570 --> 10:22.447
10% of my budget for salaries?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.280
More if you want stars.

10:24.370 --> 10:27.157
Lance alone is gonna run you
300 a day, easy.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.286
Fuck, Kiki, I just want it to be good.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.372
Stars, no stars,
I just want it to be right.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.661
All eyes are gonna be on this.
Who knows?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.422
We could even cross over.
No, we fuckIng could!

10:38.510 --> 10:41.502
We do an R-rated version,
play drive-ins,

10:41.600 --> 10:42.885
so it has got

10:43.720 --> 10:44.766
to pop.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.472
- I hear you.
- All right. Let's go through...

10:47.560 --> 10:50.302
And pick our top three. Okay.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.015
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

10:52.440 --> 10:54.067
Can you keep your voice down, please?

10:54.150 --> 10:56.061
I'm not yelling.
You're the one making a scene.

10:56.150 --> 10:57.731
All right, calm down...

10:57.820 --> 10:59.356
So I need an answer about the clinic.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.486
Can we use the 3-6-6, or what?

11:01.570 --> 11:03.982
Yeah. Why can't we do it
in the Hi-Hat?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.991
Because I'm open for business
when they need the space.

11:07.660 --> 11:09.161
And what's gonna go down again?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.206
I told you.

11:11.290 --> 11:14.043
Checkups, vaccinations, birth control,

11:14.130 --> 11:15.540
- basic stuff.
- How many people?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.546
- A hundred, maybe.
- Oof!

11:18.630 --> 11:20.757
I mean, over the course of a day.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.637
Why can't they go to a regular doctor?

11:23.180 --> 11:24.590
Just asking.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.671
Some of these doctors
sexually abuse the women.

11:28.350 --> 11:29.476
It's true.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.720
Field clinics are safer.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.686
Yeah, whatever you need.

11:34.730 --> 11:37.221
Just, how involved
in this thing you gonna get?

11:37.860 --> 11:38.986
Yes or no?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.862
Hey, you don't get blood anywhere,
you're out by 10:00 or 11:00.

11:42.950 --> 11:43.939
I don't give a fuck.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.786
- Thank you.
- I've gotta go.

11:46.870 --> 11:50.362
You can't just run away
every time things get hot.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.282
Look who's fucking talking.
All you do is run.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.529
I'm not running!

11:57.210 --> 11:58.586
All right, here is good.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.505
Rodney home?

12:04.600 --> 12:05.806
Mmm.

12:07.140 --> 12:08.630
Thanks.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.597
- Which floor?
- Third.

12:22.860 --> 12:24.657
You're not going in there.

12:24.740 --> 12:26.276
I live there.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.076
It's gonna suck you right back.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.946
You're gonna be on that shit
again in 10 minutes.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.207
- Nah.
- It's no good.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.450
I can feel it.

12:37.550 --> 12:38.699
Look, Shay,

12:39.670 --> 12:40.750
just stay with me.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.671
I want you to stay with me.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.266
Driver, keep going.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.515
Where to?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.736
What do you think?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.656
I think it's clever.

13:12.660 --> 13:14.616
But isn't it kind of...

13:15.120 --> 13:16.747
- All about the Wolf?
- Yes.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.167
He's got all the best lines.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.582
He's got most of the lines.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.256
Right? A” Little Red Riding Hood
does is

13:26.220 --> 13:29.599
get chased, suck dick,
and have orgasms.

13:29.970 --> 13:31.767
I think he missed the whole point,

13:31.850 --> 13:33.727
which is that in this, the hero

13:33.810 --> 13:36.017
- is the fucking heroine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.727
Red is a powerful creature.

13:38.810 --> 13:41.028
She's gotta be as dangerous

13:41.110 --> 13:43.647
as anyone else in that fucking forest.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.140
Yeah.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.198
And then she's gotta realize

13:48.700 --> 13:52.113
that she could turn the tables
anytime she wants.

13:52.830 --> 13:55.458
- And when she does...
- That wolf is dead meat.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.956
Let me warm those up for you ladies.

13:58.670 --> 13:59.876
Nah.

14:05.930 --> 14:08.330
You think you could do better?

14:08.430 --> 14:09.545
Yeah, actually, I do.

14:10.640 --> 14:13.518
And do you understand
the feeling I'm going for?

14:14.180 --> 14:17.434
hire an erotic
7'aX/_Dr/ver
Vlb€?

14:21.190 --> 14:22.930
Yes.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.770
Okay, here's the bad news.

14:25.860 --> 14:29.944
Right now I don't have dime one
to pay another writer.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.691
You were gonna pay me?

14:36.660 --> 14:37.820
Surprise.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.160
Got something for you.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.992
- In a minute, okay?
- No, now.

14:42.460 --> 14:43.996
You'll like this.
Come on. Close your eyes.

14:44.340 --> 14:46.410
- CO, I really have to get ready.
- Come on.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.540
Close your eyes.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.005
Keep them closed.

14:58.350 --> 14:59.647
Okay.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.009
Open.

15:04.110 --> 15:05.225
Wow.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.356
They're big.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.481
That ain't all. Come here.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.695
Look in there.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.900
- What the hell?
- Just look.

15:20.790 --> 15:21.950
What?

15:22.040 --> 15:23.587
Pure breed.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.951
From the Upper East Side,
some French place.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.870
- CO, I...
- Yo, check that collar.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.871
- It's wet. It peed.
- Well, you gotta train it.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.040
I can't train a dog, C.C.

15:34.220 --> 15:37.678
I mean, I've never had one.
I don't know how.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.761
Well... I thought you loved dogs.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.011
They're okay.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.988
- I can take it back.
- No. It's... I've got him.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.981
Anyway, it's yours.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.155
Do what you want with it.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.797
You'll be more comfortable
when we open It up.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.870
It's a Castro, so...

16:25.310 --> 16:27.062
Is this okay? I...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.777
I don't wanna, I thought you...

16:30.940 --> 16:32.441
No, it's fine.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.440
You ever been with a woman?

16:35.530 --> 16:36.906
Not for fun.

16:36.990 --> 16:39.993
I mean, sometimes for work, but...

16:41.580 --> 16:42.956
I'm into it.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.159
You sure?

16:45.750 --> 16:47.081
It's fine.

16:47.880 --> 16:48.995
It's good.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.001
You're a little like a guy, anyway.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.876
Except you got boobs, kind of.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.789
And no dick.

16:57.260 --> 16:58.591
That's a relief.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.266
Really.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.516
Dicks are assholes.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.437
I'm so sick of dicks.

17:08.020 --> 17:11.023
If I never see another dick
for the rest of my life, I swear...

17:11.650 --> 17:13.060
You don't have to.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.787
I could take care of stuff
for a while.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.780
You could just veg

17:25.290 --> 17:26.951
till you're ready. And then you can

17:27.040 --> 17:29.543
get another job, maybe,
another type of work.

17:29.630 --> 17:32.258
- You know?
- Like what?

17:32.340 --> 17:35.218
Whatever you want.
It could be anything.

17:35.550 --> 17:38.758
I saw on the news, they even got
woman astronauts now.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.671
So I should become an astronaut?

17:41.770 --> 17:45.388
No, that's not what I mean.
I'm just, I'm...

17:45.850 --> 17:47.397
Talking out loud.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.686
Thinking.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.855
You're thinking out loud.

17:52.190 --> 17:53.430
.702, and that was...

17:53.780 --> 17:54.815
Come here.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.151
with
Bermuda Triangle Blues,

17:56.240 --> 17:57.650
of?c their album
Plastic Letters.

17:57.740 --> 18:00.618
And before that; we heard
The Clash, with
Janie Jones.

18:00.700 --> 18:05.114
.702, Megan Shelley is me, PIX is us...

18:05.540 --> 18:07.667
Now, the entrance is
all the way on this side,

18:07.750 --> 18:09.536
so we won't be disturbing
that building at all.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.292
- But you have the side door.
- It's a fire exit only.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.756
- I'm still stuck at go.
- Okay.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.831
You're abutting a wide
residential zone here.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.177
- A nightclub isn't really...
- It's more of a lounge.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.632
There's liquor, music, dancing.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.729
We know where this goes,
especially with this clientele.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.879
It's the wrong place for it.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.801
There are plenty of other
bars and restaurants around.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.016
- Not nightclubs.
- Okay.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.566
I think I threw everyone
with that word.

18:33.650 --> 18:36.642
I'm going for a kind
of quiet glamour, you know?

18:36.740 --> 18:38.856
Old Hollywood. Screwball comedy feel.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.862
You expect Carole Lombard
to come wafting in any minute.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.030
I have a question.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.906
We're gonna open the floor
for questions in a few.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.868
My sister lives across from one
of these type bars on 10th Street.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.168
- It's not a bar. _
- There's too many bars, period.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.241
And every time a store closes,
it becomes a bar.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.706
May I speak?

18:55.670 --> 18:58.468
They walk around, no shirt,
grab each other

18:58.550 --> 18:59.630
right in the open.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.927
- It's everywhere now.
- Let me stop you right there.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.090
We're all thinking it.

19:03.180 --> 19:04.420
Someone has to say it.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.226
That's enough, Mary.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.380
I think she's right.
I think everyone is thinking it.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.266
- But I don't know how to approach...
- Let me butt in here.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.550
This is taking a strange turn.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.436
- Thank you.
- I'm gay, okay?

19:14.530 --> 19:16.020
I'm a homosexual.

19:16.110 --> 19:18.101
Are there other homosexuals
on thIs committee?

19:19.490 --> 19:21.105
Okay, so that's two.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.156
And there are more
on the full board, trust me.

19:23.450 --> 19:25.406
So this is not an issue
as far as I'm concerned.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.070
Can we proceed?

19:27.290 --> 19:30.202
For the record, if you're implying
that my comments were...

19:30.290 --> 19:32.997
I'm not implying anything.
I have ears.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.542
And I have been living
as a gay man in this city

19:35.630 --> 19:36.949
for the last 20 years, okay?

19:37.050 --> 19:39.678
I've heard it all about 800,000 times.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.751
My concerns are purely practical.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.091
Fine.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.670
Then we agree.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.387
Shall we get back to it?

19:47.220 --> 19:49.097
Tell us again
your target opening date?

19:49.180 --> 19:50.431
Uh...

19:51.600 --> 19:54.683
So I get the vaccinations,
the birth control...

19:56.020 --> 19:58.318
I don't know about all that.
I could probably handle food.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.066
Can you get sandwiches or...

20:00.320 --> 20:02.276
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Hey, Abby.

20:02.530 --> 20:03.861
Hey.

20:03.950 --> 20:06.191
What's it gonna be, Candy?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.150
Abby.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.366
All your friends,

20:10.460 --> 20:12.667
with their music and their films

20:12.750 --> 20:14.160
and their gallery shows,

20:14.250 --> 20:15.956
where do they come up with the money?

20:18.210 --> 20:20.041
Most of them get it
from their parents.

20:21.090 --> 20:22.330
Strapped, Candy?

20:23.220 --> 20:24.676
Yeah.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.842
Yeah, I'm short on my movie money.

20:27.140 --> 20:29.631
I got about half
of what I need. Maybe.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.016
So, what do you say, Vince?

20:34.730 --> 20:36.516
- What?_
- You want In?

20:37.230 --> 20:38.527
Come on!

20:38.610 --> 20:42.239
There's no more risk than investing
in a fucking restaurant.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.777
The bar business is
enough of a gamble for me.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.026
You sure?

20:49.790 --> 20:52.452
I will take a Myers's and tonic.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.120
You got it.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.996
I hate to say it,
but you do know that

20:57.090 --> 20:59.240
Frankie sold
his dry cleaning store, right?

21:00.050 --> 21:01.665
Frankie had a dry cleaning store?

21:02.010 --> 21:03.329
Won it in a card game,

21:03.430 --> 21:05.386
and then sold it back
to the original owner.

21:05.470 --> 21:07.347
So he's flush for once.

21:07.890 --> 21:09.505
At least he was.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.921
- Do you know where he is?
- Got his haunts.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.806
But I can't guarantee
he'll be at any of them.

21:13.890 --> 21:14.891
You know what? I know Christina.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.265
- No, no, no.
- I'm gonna call her.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.646
Candy, it won't do you any good.
She's looking for Frankie, too.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.608
- Look here. Write this down.
- Yeah.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.907
First place I'd check is
the card game on 49th.

21:25.990 --> 21:27.867
- Thanks.
- Between 8th and 9th.

21:27.950 --> 21:29.235
If he's not there,
any of the theaters...

21:29.330 --> 21:31.286
I thought maybe you didn't like me.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.577
Like you? I don't even know you.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.950
That was going to be my defense.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.411
Your defense? You're not on trial.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.331
We are all on trial, baby.

21:40.670 --> 21:42.661
That sounds like something
from our reading list.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.125
Okay, you got me.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.848
So, what are you in for, Dona?

21:48.930 --> 21:50.170
Job certification?

21:50.890 --> 21:52.016
Union upgrade?

21:53.100 --> 21:54.977
Like, communications, maybe?

21:56.190 --> 21:57.339
I'm not sure. Are you?

21:58.310 --> 21:59.720
Well, the long goal...

21:59.820 --> 22:01.606
- Registered nurse.
- Okay.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.566
So I'm working on my ADN now,

22:03.650 --> 22:06.904
and hopefully start
on the BSN by next spring.

22:07.490 --> 22:10.197
- Wow, You have a whole plan.
- Yeah, this is how it's done.

22:11.910 --> 22:14.322
And speaking of plans...

22:14.410 --> 22:15.991
You and me, tomorrow night.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.912
Ren, you seem really nice,

22:19.960 --> 22:22.497
and we can help each other
in class or what have you,

22:23.050 --> 22:25.837
but I have a man,

22:25.920 --> 22:27.330
so it can't be like that.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.466
Say no more.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.096
I never pressure a lady.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.920
Doesn't anyone want to take our order?

22:37.640 --> 22:38.641
Hello?

22:41.480 --> 22:43.892
That's right, baby. That's it!

22:46.570 --> 22:48.310
Yeah.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.439
Yeah!

23:10.510 --> 23:12.046
Now that you're all relaxed,

23:13.390 --> 23:14.675
you wanna know about that thing?

23:15.560 --> 23:16.549
Talk about it.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.721
Apollo 12 Lounge, it's just a house?

23:20.060 --> 23:22.688
Gaming, poker,
sometimes craps, and a bar.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.606
Maybe a few girls.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.732
- Anyone else?
- Straight family.

23:28.820 --> 23:30.651
Miss Cookie,
her boyfriend, and her son.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.525
Round-the-way hustlers,

23:32.820 --> 23:35.789
gang boys, dope men,
macks, chop-shoppers, a few fences.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.530
They all making money out there,

23:37.620 --> 23:40.111
but they don't like to leave
the neighborhood to spend it.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.325
Mmm-hmm.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.376
- And the pot?
- Depends who's there.

23:46.510 --> 23:47.499
Could be 20,

23:48.420 --> 23:50.376
40 Gs on the table.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.540
- Cash money.
- Guns?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.216
No guns.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.178
Cookie's Uncle Morris
checks everybody at the door.

23:57.680 --> 24:01.229
That's why you need me
to bring in your hardware,

24:01.520 --> 24:02.839
stash it for you in the coat check.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.640
Uncle Morris got a gun?

24:05.730 --> 24:07.140
A machete.

24:07.230 --> 24:09.186
And you don't want
to see him swing that thing.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.645
Yeah. Fuck a machete.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.526
Come on, baby.
Stop by and check it out.

24:16.660 --> 24:18.036
A” bad actors, huh?

24:18.120 --> 24:19.496
Don't worry, stud.

24:19.580 --> 24:21.241
A|| you'll be eating is cannibals.

24:21.370 --> 24:22.359
Hmm.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.582
I got something for you.
Been working on this all weekend...

24:26.670 --> 24:28.206
Koufax. ..

24:30.920 --> 24:32.626
Goes into his motion,

24:32.720 --> 24:33.880
it's...

24:33.970 --> 24:35.460
Right down the alley.

24:35.550 --> 24:37.461
Tony Kubek goes down swinging.

24:39.310 --> 24:40.971
Having your second childhood?

24:42.140 --> 24:43.937
- What do you mean?
- No, I'm just messing with you.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.601
You heard about the movie
I'm making, right?

24:52.700 --> 24:54.816
- The Big Bad Wolff
- Yeah.

24:55.910 --> 24:57.946
I'm having some
fucking money troubles.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.287
Yeah, welcome to my world.

25:00.370 --> 25:01.746
That's not what I heard.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.199
Oh, yeah? What'd you hear?

25:04.960 --> 25:07.588
How much you make
selling that dry cleaners?

25:09.750 --> 25:11.001
Depends who's asking.

25:13.550 --> 25:15.586
Yeah, I sold it for 12 and a half Gs.

25:17.050 --> 25:19.427
Down to 10, as of this morning.

25:19.510 --> 25:20.841
I got a proposition for you.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.136
Mmm?

25:23.230 --> 25:25.095
How'd you like to be a movie producer?

25:26.020 --> 25:28.568
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.560
What's a producer do?

25:31.440 --> 25:32.429
Nothing much.

25:33.860 --> 25:37.239
No, he invests in a movie,
kicks back till it opens,

25:37.320 --> 25:39.276
gets to see his name in lights.

25:39.370 --> 25:40.530
Uh-huh.

25:40.620 --> 25:43.532
And maybe hits the jackpot,
maybe loses his shirt.

25:44.370 --> 25:47.498
A gambler gambles.
That's what he does, right?

25:49.540 --> 25:52.043
That 10K down from
12 and half this morning,

25:52.460 --> 25:55.179
how long do you think it'd take
you to blow through all that?

25:55.680 --> 25:57.580
Well, you never know.

26:00.180 --> 26:03.013
You remember the last time
you lost that much cash?

26:03.600 --> 26:04.840
Which last time?

26:05.640 --> 26:07.722
- That's what I'm saying.
-Mmmmmm.

26:08.230 --> 26:09.970
Come in with me. Come on.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.059
Be my co-producer.

26:11.150 --> 26:14.438
Even if you lose it all,
this will be the one blown bet

26:14.530 --> 26:18.364
you'll be telling stories about
for the rest of your fucking life.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.069
Co-producer.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.740
You said I was gonna be a producer.

26:25.160 --> 26:28.118
We're gonna be partners.
That makes me a co-producer, too.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.450
Yeah, what the hell.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.626
Sure.

26:34.340 --> 26:35.830
Shake.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.045
You got it on you?

26:41.390 --> 26:43.176
- Wow. You're pushy.
- Yeah.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.010
Looking out for our fucking movie.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.840
All right.

26:47.770 --> 26:50.261
- I'm coming to get it.
- All right, partner.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.147
We all agree raids are worthless
without the element of surprise.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.390
"Surprise" and "raid"
are two words that

26:55.490 --> 26:57.446
never go together in this zone.

26:57.530 --> 26:59.851
And once these clap factories
get that heads-up,

26:59.950 --> 27:02.111
all they need to know is how many cops
are coming through the door,

27:02.200 --> 27:04.486
so they can leave out
enough liquor to cover the crew.

27:04.580 --> 27:06.400
That's why I canceled
the first operation.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.115
Now, I want you on this new one.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.576
- This raid is vice-related, correct?
- Right.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.036
The parlor people will be charged
with promotion of prostitution

27:13.130 --> 27:15.086
and violation of liquor laws.

27:15.170 --> 27:16.501
But I want you taking the door.

27:17.090 --> 27:19.172
Vice will be on the scene,
but you're the lead.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.922
You really think something positive
will come from more raids?

27:22.010 --> 27:23.557
We'll see.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.710
I plan on announcing them
at the very last moment.

27:25.850 --> 27:28.171
- What do you say?
- I'll do it...

27:29.060 --> 27:30.516
As long as my boss agrees.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.436
Deputy Inspector?

27:32.520 --> 27:33.726
So ordered.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.317
One more thing, Detective.

27:35.940 --> 27:37.737
Our friend Gene Goldman
was a little ticked off

27:37.820 --> 27:39.447
when I canceled the raids
the first time.

27:39.990 --> 27:41.946
But he stood down when I convinced him

27:42.030 --> 27:43.270
we were about to be compromised.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.611
I'd like to_show him _
I apprecnate hlS cooperation.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.491
Throw Goldman a bone
and keep him in the loop.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.626
I got, like, an infection.

27:52.710 --> 27:54.166
How much it cost for some pills?

27:54.250 --> 27:56.206
We just gotta get you looked at,
but everything's free.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.212
- I didn't believe it myself.
- Shit.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.671
Penicillin.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.170
Make sure to take them all.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.842
This is the first time I got medicine
and didn't have to blow the doctor.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.886
Could I also get some
cough syrup for my daughter?

28:09.980 --> 28:11.936
I'm sorry, I'm a little
uncomfortable with that.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.681
Goes great with a shot of vodka.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.970
I'm giving away free ones.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.818
You think you're joking, but I
had a client once, he wanted...

28:19.900 --> 28:22.482
- I don't need to hear.
- You really don't.

28:26.910 --> 28:29.697
- Satisfied?
- I'm just getting started.

28:29.950 --> 28:31.918
Next we're gonna try
to broker the terms between

28:32.000 --> 28:33.740
the working girls and the residents

28:33.830 --> 28:35.627
over at that complex on the West Side.

28:35.710 --> 28:37.951
- Slow down, will you?
- I don't wanna.

28:46.510 --> 28:48.057
For such a fashionable guy,

28:48.140 --> 28:50.176
I thought you'd have
better decorating sense.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.556
I'm not trying
to advertise my presence.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.011
The locals aren't big fans of change.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.389
What brings you here?

28:56.690 --> 28:59.568
I'm about to head up
a raid on the parlors.

29:00.650 --> 29:01.685
Thought you'd like to know.

29:02.610 --> 29:05.067
That's uncharacteristically
forthcoming of you, Detective.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.440
You keep telling me about your plans.

29:07.530 --> 29:09.942
Maybe you'd like to observe
an actual police operation.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.406
See what we do.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.786
They're not gonna be
expecting us this time.

29:13.870 --> 29:15.076
It's on,

29:15.170 --> 29:18.082
but I'm gonna need you
to leave it to me.

29:18.170 --> 29:19.876
Can I at least make one suggestion?

29:21.970 --> 29:23.835
I could call a couple of people
I know in the press.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.676
People I trust.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.210
They could be there, too.

29:29.140 --> 29:30.801
That is, as long as
it's all right with you.

29:32.060 --> 29:35.223
Only if you call them an hour
before we kick the doors in,

29:35.310 --> 29:36.595
no sooner.

29:36.690 --> 29:39.227
I don't want any leaks.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.685
Agreed.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.646
There's a quote-unquote
gentlemen's club

29:42.740 --> 29:44.605
- up in the Bronx.
- Whereabouts?

29:45.030 --> 29:48.522
Corner of Broke-Ass and Strung Out.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.735
Where exactly?

29:49.830 --> 29:51.536
Barretto off of Spofford.

29:51.620 --> 29:52.826
They run a fat game.

29:52.910 --> 29:54.491
I wanna hit it.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.536
- Who you bringing?
- Just Frankie.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.126
Frankie?

29:59.210 --> 30:00.370
Black Frankie.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.081
You wanna rob some titsuns,
that's on you.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.039
Why am I here?

30:05.130 --> 30:08.008
I just wanna make sure that the target
isn't somebody you know.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.711
- If it's on Barretto, no.
- I figured.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.880
But I didn't want
to step on anybody's toes.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.590
That's good you asked.

30:15.190 --> 30:16.805
Anything I can do to help?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.351
Yeah, actually, I need a wheel.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.850
Can you loan me Carlos?

30:20.940 --> 30:22.771
- That buys me a slice.
- Of course.

30:24.110 --> 30:25.441
After the score, pay Tommy.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.309
You got it.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.116
Is that $3 for the bananas?

30:38.370 --> 30:39.530
Take your positions.

30:41.210 --> 30:42.199
Move. Let's go.

30:53.390 --> 30:55.176
- Police!
- Don't move.

30:55.600 --> 30:56.760
What the fuck is this?

30:56.850 --> 30:58.511
- Police here!
- Nobody told us.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.300
Jesus Christ.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.061
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

31:02.150 --> 31:03.640
Here they come,
here they come.

31:03.730 --> 31:04.719
Here's one right now. Miss!

31:04.820 --> 31:06.185
Miss, is there anything you wanna say?

31:06.650 --> 31:08.447
Tell me what your charges are!

31:09.910 --> 31:12.151
Get back, everybody. Get back!

31:14.790 --> 31:16.781
Do you want your wife
or daughter working here?

31:16.870 --> 31:18.861
Miss, do you
have anything to say?

31:19.210 --> 31:20.199
You wanna drink something?

31:21.250 --> 31:23.741
- No, I'm okay, thank you.
- No?

31:23.840 --> 31:24.955
Mmm-mmm.

31:26.090 --> 31:27.500
Come sit.

31:32.970 --> 31:36.212
So, I want to talk to you
about this part.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.688
Yeah, Kiki said
you wanted me to play Little Red.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.055
It's the lead, right?

31:42.150 --> 31:43.356
Well, I wanna talk to you about it.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.010
Maybe read a couple of scenes.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.567
- Like an audition.
- Yeah.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.730
Also, we start pretty soon.

31:55.030 --> 31:57.407
I heal really fast, and...

31:58.710 --> 31:59.995
With some makeup,

32:00.080 --> 32:02.241
in a few days or maybe a week,
it'll be fine.

32:02.330 --> 32:03.410
Okay.

32:03.710 --> 32:06.338
I just don't understand
the audition part,

32:06.420 --> 32:08.376
'cause you've already seen me
in plenty of movies.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.375
Yeah, like we do.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.636
But this one...

32:15.850 --> 32:17.590
I actually give a shit about this one.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.722
- You live here alone?
- Yeah.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.271
It's nice.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.686
Hey.

32:30.650 --> 32:31.639
Was that CO?

32:35.530 --> 32:36.519
Mmm.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.697
So, you need a different plan,
don't you think?

32:44.080 --> 32:45.832
Can I use your bathroom for a minute?

32:46.540 --> 32:48.292
Yeah, sure. It's right there.

32:52.260 --> 32:54.387
You know what, it's easy for you

32:54.470 --> 32:56.381
to say shit like that.
You don't have somebody

32:56.470 --> 32:59.018
breathing down your back.
You have your own money.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.476
You can just come and go
wherever you please.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.300
You think somebody handed me this?

33:02.390 --> 33:05.052
This is the life I chose.
You chose something different. Okay?

33:05.150 --> 33:07.220
You think it's a choice? Yeah?

33:07.610 --> 33:08.895
Okay.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.277
What am I supposed to do now?

33:10.360 --> 33:14.273
Just say, "Oh. Hey, C.C.,
sorry, I changed my mind.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.941
"Catch you later."

33:16.030 --> 33:18.237
What the fuck kind of advice is that?

33:18.910 --> 33:22.209
Do you have any fucking idea
what the fucking reality of this is?

33:22.290 --> 33:23.609
Everything I do,

33:23.710 --> 33:26.622
everywhere I go, every penny I spend,

33:26.750 --> 33:29.207
everything belongs to him.
He is on me.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.212
He is in my head. He knows everything.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.962
What I wear,
where I sleep, who I fuck.

33:35.050 --> 33:37.041
There is nothing about me
that belongs to me.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.880
It all belongs to him.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.560
I'm sorry.

33:51.610 --> 33:53.737
Hey, it's okay. I'll get you a drink.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.349
I could use one, too.

34:11.630 --> 34:13.586
Why are you looking at me like that?

34:15.090 --> 34:16.079
What do you mean?

34:26.850 --> 34:28.340
Shit, Lori,

34:28.810 --> 34:30.766
for a second there,
you sounded like a...

34:32.860 --> 34:36.148
In-over-her-head kid
traipsing through the woods,

34:36.240 --> 34:38.777
with a bad-ass wolf hot on her tail.

34:43.330 --> 34:44.365
I wasn't acting.

34:44.830 --> 34:46.457
Yeah, no one's that good.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.628
Well, no one we work with, anyway.

35:05.310 --> 35:06.880
And you didn't mention me?

35:06.980 --> 35:09.938
She's aware
of who you are, Larry.

35:10.520 --> 35:13.227
- Candy knows how good I am.
- Everybody does.

35:13.980 --> 35:15.220
They do?

35:15.320 --> 35:17.481
- Check it out, check it out.
- Well, all right.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.520
Then why didn't she ask me
to be in her movie?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.235
- Why don't you ask her?
- No, no, no.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.366
Larry Brown don't beg.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.781
Go on ahead, so you're not late
for your regular.

35:30.710 --> 35:33.747
I gotta say, as hard as I've
been working in the films,

35:33.880 --> 35:35.950
I'm getting tired
of having to trick, too.

35:36.710 --> 35:39.508
I'm barely making my nut
as it is, you know?

35:40.470 --> 35:42.540
We got a family to maintain.

35:43.010 --> 35:46.013
So go. All right, babe?

35:48.560 --> 35:51.017
Fresh-made IDs,
everybody, anybody, who wants them?

35:51.440 --> 35:54.318
Switchblades, butterfly knives...

35:57.570 --> 35:58.605
Hey?

35:59.860 --> 36:01.350
Anyone home?

36:03.070 --> 36:05.152
Where the fuck were you
the last couple of days?

36:05.740 --> 36:07.492
At the track, movies...

36:08.330 --> 36:10.992
You knew when you met me.
I'm free, like the wind.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.536
I'm not living like this
anymore, Frankie,

36:12.630 --> 36:14.120
I told you a thousand times.

36:14.210 --> 36:16.371
I know, I know.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.166
I'm sorry.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.796
I brought pizza.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.170
What kind?

36:23.050 --> 36:24.290
What kind you think?

36:25.010 --> 36:26.921
Mushrooms and anchow?

36:28.310 --> 36:30.687
When it comes to you,
I got a mind like a trap. Huh?

36:31.980 --> 36:33.390
Come on.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.016
Dig in.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.236
So...

36:41.030 --> 36:42.566
Guess who's in the film business?

36:43.740 --> 36:44.866
Me.

36:45.990 --> 36:47.196
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

36:47.740 --> 36:50.288
I'm a co-producer on Candy's movie.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.110
I bought in for next to nothing.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.620
What's a co-producer do?

36:54.710 --> 36:56.120
A little bit of everything.

36:56.210 --> 36:58.496
Look, it's my money, so I'm in charge.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.007
You think there's a part for me?

37:02.550 --> 37:04.040
Of course.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.130
I have to audition, though, right?

37:08.600 --> 37:11.342
You just passed.
Congratulations.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.106
What do you think, Darlene?

37:20.150 --> 37:21.686
- What the fuck?
- It's closed-circuit.

37:21.780 --> 37:23.145
I called down to the desk
and ordered it up.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.696
No. No.

37:25.740 --> 37:27.731
I thought you'd be pleased. I...

37:27.830 --> 37:31.368
I just had this wild idea, right, that
we could get in bed and, you know,

37:31.450 --> 37:33.281
fuck while we watch you fuck.

37:33.370 --> 37:35.201
You need to get that idea
out your head.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.950
So I'm gonna tell you
how it's gonna go.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.497
I'm gonna ride you
with my back to the TV set.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.659
I don't wanna see the movie,

37:40.760 --> 37:42.159
and I don't want to hear it, either.

37:43.590 --> 37:44.670
Anything else?

37:45.840 --> 37:47.387
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

37:47.470 --> 37:49.756
Two of me in this room
is like haVIng me twice.

37:50.510 --> 37:51.807
So it's gonna cost you double.

37:57.020 --> 37:58.351
Give it here.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.566
What?

38:25.260 --> 38:27.751
- Gonna raise you 300.
- Three hundred, that's it?

38:29.720 --> 38:32.518
You gotta bring
more money than that.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.636
Scared money don't make no money.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.266
I heard that before.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.590
I'ma say it again.
I'ma say it again.

38:43.860 --> 38:47.648
Well, Chris, the NYPD
really made a dent in Sin City today,

38:47.740 --> 38:49.617
raid/ng ﬁve massage parlors

38:49.700 --> 38:51.861
just a stone is throw
from the Theater District

38:51.950 --> 38:55.158
and Restaurant Row,
and arresting over 20 individuals,

38:55.250 --> 38:58.572
including women suspected of being
prostitutes and their managers.

39:02.710 --> 39:04.666
Let the girls
make a statement. Please!

39:05.340 --> 39:06.329
You're not gonna use that.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.172
Talking a lot of shit for a man
with some heat on him.

39:08.970 --> 39:11.507
What you gonna do with this,
give a nigga tetanus?

39:11.600 --> 39:13.670
- Stick it up your ass.
- Sit your ass down.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.806
You two, get over here!

39:15.220 --> 39:16.471
Get over here!

39:16.930 --> 39:18.010
The faggot in the coat room.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.009
Honey!

39:21.560 --> 39:23.687
No! Please, no!

39:24.320 --> 39:25.469
Please don't hurt me.

39:25.570 --> 39:27.697
- Please. Don't hurt me.
- Let's go.

39:33.910 --> 39:36.196
All right, now,
y'all gonna empty your pockets,

39:36.290 --> 39:38.326
put both hands on the table, palms up.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.617
No. Fuck you motherfuckers.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.126
I ain't doing shit.

39:45.090 --> 39:46.159
Mmm-hmm.

39:56.140 --> 39:57.676
Let me see that.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.011
"Omica" ain't no Omega.
Big difference, my brother.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.470
Negro, can you not count?

40:02.940 --> 40:04.066
I said, two hands.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.189
Come on! Come on, come on, come on!

40:18.540 --> 40:19.996
Let's go, Carlos.

40:23.420 --> 40:24.535
Fucking shit!

40:26.920 --> 40:28.410
Pussy hounds,

40:28.510 --> 40:31.297
You got demoted?
You the change girl now?

40:31.720 --> 40:34.382
What's up, Rodney?
You here for a show?

40:35.470 --> 40:37.381
Since when I gotta pay
to look at pussy?

40:37.890 --> 40:40.472
Shit, I'm Hot Rod.
Pussy pay to look at me.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.687
- What booth Shay at?
- Shay ain't here.

40:43.810 --> 40:45.437
So where she at?

40:46.020 --> 40:47.226
I ain't seen her.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.969
I know her ass done by now.

40:49.650 --> 40:50.890
Bitch need to hit these streets,

40:50.990 --> 40:52.605
recoup back some of that lost revenue.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.190
I'm sure
she's looking forward to that.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.690
This the comedy booth?

40:57.790 --> 40:59.576
Drop a coin,
your silly ass make a joke?

41:01.580 --> 41:02.820
You see her, tell her I'm looking.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.285
-Mmmmmm.
-Mmmmmm.

41:07.380 --> 41:09.507
This some nasty shit.

41:13.050 --> 41:14.426
You wanna wait till I'm finished?

41:14.510 --> 41:15.841
There's some good shit in here, bro.

41:15.930 --> 41:17.466
How much again?

41:18.970 --> 41:21.222
Give or take, 40 Gs.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.510
Very nice.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.897
Did Carlos hold up his end?

41:24.980 --> 41:27.642
I had to send him home.
Drunk damn near killed us.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.771
The fuck am I over here,
chopped liver?

41:30.900 --> 41:32.060
You guys gonna tell me what this is?

41:32.150 --> 41:33.697
We had an adventure.

41:33.780 --> 41:35.407
- An adventure?
- Yeah.

41:35.490 --> 41:37.776
- Vince, check this out.
- Holy shit.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.986
- Somebody die?
- Almost.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.953
Well, I gotta say, last night
you stuck to your plan,

41:43.040 --> 41:44.200
pulled together and earned.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.911
Which, in my book,
makes you a bona fide crew.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.410
Don't forget to pay your boss.

41:50.210 --> 41:52.417
Yeah, whatever you did,
I don't want any part of that.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.626
All right, I'll take his cut.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.466
Okay, all right.

41:57.550 --> 41:58.881
Just deal me in next time.

41:58.970 --> 42:00.551
All right, Tommy, be well.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.426
Lock it up behind you, Mike. I'm out.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.760
Gotcha.

42:04.190 --> 42:06.556
- Here's Rudy's cut, Mr. Longo.
- All right.

42:06.650 --> 42:08.265
Listen.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.850
Any of you gentlemen interested

42:09.940 --> 42:12.682
in co-producing
a major motion picture?

42:14.450 --> 42:16.566
I'll see ifI can find
the Tenant's Council lady.

42:16.660 --> 42:17.979
We'll get started here.

42:20.370 --> 42:22.577
- Hey, fellas.
- "Hey, fellas."

42:23.580 --> 42:25.616
We just came by to see
if we could help you out.

42:26.330 --> 42:27.627
Uh-huh.

42:27.710 --> 42:29.587
What's that? Hai Karate?

42:30.340 --> 42:32.046
I'm a Brut man myself.

42:32.130 --> 42:33.950
All right, guys, here's the thing.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.920
You upset the neighbors,

42:36.010 --> 42:38.387
the neighbors call the cops,
the cops pick up your girls.

42:38.470 --> 42:40.791
And round it goes.
You like it like that?

42:40.890 --> 42:41.959
Fine.

42:42.350 --> 42:43.339
You wanna change it,

42:43.430 --> 42:45.728
make it better,
maybe we can help you do that.

42:45.810 --> 42:46.799
That's all.

42:47.140 --> 42:49.802
- What's your name, sweet thing?
- Uh-oh.

42:49.900 --> 42:50.935
Shit.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.226
- Abby.
- Abby.

42:54.110 --> 42:56.351
Baby, you talking to Al Polite...

42:56.820 --> 42:58.856
And A! Polite knows what's right.

42:58.950 --> 43:00.565
These streets is public.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.151
- Can't no one tell us shit.
- This is what they do every day.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.993
They hang out, they smoke dope,
they put the girls on the streets.

43:08.670 --> 43:10.661
Let's just...
Let's be realistic, okay.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.706
How many people live here,
like a few hundred?

43:12.800 --> 43:14.916
More like a thousand,
in all of these buildings.

43:15.010 --> 43:16.466
Okay, okay, so that's pretty big.

43:16.550 --> 43:18.290
So we can do _
some practical planning,

43:18.380 --> 43:20.507
make agreements, we take shifts, even.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.710
You have the park
from this hour to this hour...

43:22.810 --> 43:24.516
No, no, no, we want them gone.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.010
We want you gone,
mami.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.636
- Okay, okay.
- Doesn't work like that.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.345
We can figure out a way to...

43:29.440 --> 43:31.897
Tell 'em, Dorothy. We can...

43:32.900 --> 43:34.640
- We can work this out.
- Help you negotiate.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.486
I don't have the skin
for this kind of weather,

43:38.030 --> 43:39.440
and I get sunstroke.

43:40.030 --> 43:41.236
Not sunburned, sunstroke.

43:41.320 --> 43:44.289
You can wear
one of those Visor hats.

43:44.370 --> 43:46.656
You can put me
in a bathtub full of ice...

43:46.750 --> 43:48.786
What happened with
the Mayor's Office? Hmm?

43:49.540 --> 43:50.746
You get your permits?

43:50.830 --> 43:52.491
Nope, they turned me down.

43:53.500 --> 43:57.539
The film's context and subtext
wasn't up to their standards.

43:57.630 --> 43:59.427
Yeah? Well, what did I tell you?

43:59.510 --> 44:01.796
The city doesn't want
to be known for its fuck flicks.

44:01.890 --> 44:03.209
Is that an I-told-you-so?

44:04.390 --> 44:07.427
You know what? Fuck them.

44:07.980 --> 44:10.471
Fuck them and their fucking permits.

44:11.190 --> 44:13.556
I'm gonna shoot wherever I want,

44:13.650 --> 44:15.470
whenever I fucking want.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.470
And get fined or arrested.

44:17.570 --> 44:19.276
You got bail money
included in this budget?

44:19.360 --> 44:22.659
I got this, Harvey. I got it.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.901
Worry about the budget
when you run out of money, right?

44:25.450 --> 44:27.031
That's a good plan.

44:27.580 --> 44:28.945
Here's the bottom line. Okay?

44:29.040 --> 44:31.918
Your girls aren't doing much business
here in the daytime, anyway.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.376
So maybe this is
more of a nighttime spot.

44:33.460 --> 44:34.996
- No, we don't want that.
- Okay, hold on.

44:35.090 --> 44:36.796
Dorothy, tell them about
that building in the Mission.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.836
- The deal we helped broker.
- Yeah, it actually...

44:39.210 --> 44:41.963
It worked out good,
because what we did...

44:42.050 --> 44:43.927
- Excuse me.
- What?

44:44.600 --> 44:46.556
- Well. Hang on...
- He don't want your ass no more.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.382
- You put out to pasture!
- Come on. Let's get back to it.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.596
Looks like she's going
back to it right now.

44:52.640 --> 44:55.052
- My little runaway.
- Do you see me running now?

44:55.150 --> 44:57.471
Shit. You just got here.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.856
You were staring at me over there
like you wanted to kill me.

44:59.940 --> 45:02.397
Do you want to kill me, C.C.?
'Cause here I am.

45:02.490 --> 45:03.809
Bitch, best tread light.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.480
Maybe you got something
you want to say to me.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.276
You got anything to say, C.C.?

45:08.990 --> 45:12.039
You know, Ash, you're bold
with a crowd around you.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.496
I got something I want to say to you.

45:14.580 --> 45:16.787
I want to say thank you.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.587
Thank you. Because all those
years living with you,

45:19.670 --> 45:21.410
all the head-fucking,

45:21.510 --> 45:23.466
and the cuttings
and the beatings that I took,

45:23.550 --> 45:25.586
and I survived it?

45:25.680 --> 45:28.137
That just all showed me
how strong I really was.

45:28.220 --> 45:31.849
That just all led around to me
being who I am today,

45:31.930 --> 45:33.807
which is your worst nightmare.

45:36.020 --> 45:37.601
- Who you are, huh?
-Mmmmmm.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.812
Nah. Nah, who you are...

45:43.530 --> 45:45.987
Who you were and who you'll always be

45:46.070 --> 45:49.028
is my begging-for-love,
"I'll do anything you say, C.C."

45:49.120 --> 45:50.690
bottom-dog bitch.

45:52.540 --> 45:54.280
Damn, girl...

45:54.370 --> 45:56.201
You was the easiest turnout
I ever had.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.126
Wanna know why?

45:59.460 --> 46:01.837
Because from day one,
I had your number.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.829
My worst nightmare?

46:08.300 --> 46:09.551
Shit, Ash,

46:09.640 --> 46:12.302
I could take you in the back
of my short right the fuck now,

46:12.980 --> 46:14.880
put your legs in the air,
no time at all have you

46:14.980 --> 46:16.971
shouting my name
like you was in church, baby,

46:17.060 --> 46:19.267
then send you out in a hurricane
to make me my money.

46:20.150 --> 46:22.141
Shit, girl,

46:22.230 --> 46:23.777
people never change.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.566
Don't you know that by now?

46:25.990 --> 46:28.732
And all that nonsense over there?

46:28.820 --> 46:30.447
Come on, Ash.

46:31.540 --> 46:32.825
That's just you playing pretend.

46:33.750 --> 46:35.570
You're right.

46:36.620 --> 46:37.826
You're right.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.208
'Cause the real me,
she just wants to see you buried.

46:52.220 --> 46:54.597
- You seen the edger?
- Over there.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.761
You're supposed to be uptown
with Ca! looking at drapes.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.187
Shit! I spaced it out.

47:03.860 --> 47:05.600
What's going on with you?

47:05.690 --> 47:07.487
I think I can win over
this crusty old board

47:07.570 --> 47:09.618
ifI trim operating hours
and fudge capacity.

47:09.700 --> 47:11.656
What's our new max? 140? 150?

47:11.740 --> 47:13.367
- 120, tops.
- No...

47:13.450 --> 47:15.361
And I had to blow the fire
department guy to get that.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.577
- Kidding. Not really.
- You're full of shit.

47:18.670 --> 47:21.742
It was 130, even before
we added the alcove.

47:22.750 --> 47:25.583
- Why are you jinxing us?
- Jinxing us.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.119
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Kenneth...

47:27.220 --> 47:28.960
I'm trying to keep us
from fucking ruin,

47:29.050 --> 47:30.677
if you want to know,
and I'm doing my best.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.250
- Really?
- But this is bullshit.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.511
- You're running amok.
- I'm running amok?

47:34.600 --> 47:36.591
- I'm trying to realize our vision!
- Wood from the African jungle!

47:36.680 --> 47:39.843
Crushed velvet sofas,
marble urinals...

47:39.940 --> 47:41.089
This is not the Vanderbilt mansion.

47:41.190 --> 47:42.726
You need to come down
out of the fucking clouds!

47:42.810 --> 47:43.811
Keep your voice down.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.391
I'm sorry.

47:49.280 --> 47:50.850
I gotta go see Cal.

47:50.950 --> 47:52.565
We need to finish
this discussion, Paul.

47:52.660 --> 47:53.820
Well, I can't.

47:55.330 --> 47:57.116
Just fucking can't.

48:01.290 --> 48:02.780
Where are the rest of the kids?

48:04.040 --> 48:07.419
They ate earlier.
Patrick, drink your milk.

48:07.920 --> 48:10.377
Stop! You're gonna break it!

48:12.140 --> 48:13.846
- Over here!
- Pass the yams.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.642
- Give it back!
- No!

48:24.770 --> 48:26.351
I'm done. Can I go watch TV?

48:27.150 --> 48:28.139
Not tonight.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.021
Go upstairs, the both of you.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.520
Fine.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.285
You motherfucker.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.701
What? Like this was
a big goddamn secret

48:46.800 --> 48:48.006
I was keeping from you?

48:48.090 --> 48:50.297
You said as long as I wasn't nailing
the women, you could live with it.

48:50.380 --> 48:52.428
- And you said you were protected.
-Iam.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.136
That's why I'm here, taking your shit,

48:54.220 --> 48:56.427
instead of sitting
in a holding cell right now.

48:56.510 --> 48:59.092
They made my bail right after
the arraignment this morning.

48:59.180 --> 49:01.228
And in case you were worried about me,

49:01.310 --> 49:02.720
just in case,

49:02.810 --> 49:05.768
I'm not gonna do a day of time.
My lawyer's getting me an ACD.

49:05.860 --> 49:07.145
What the fuck is that?

49:08.360 --> 49:09.645
An Adjournment...

49:10.400 --> 49:12.641
In Contemplation of Dismissal,
or something.

49:13.490 --> 49:15.151
Means all I gotta do
is pay some fines.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.652
Bobby, you were on
the fucking television!

49:17.740 --> 49:19.651
- Yeah, I heard.
- You have children!

49:20.250 --> 49:22.320
They have friends, they have teachers.

49:22.410 --> 49:24.458
How are they supposed
to show their faces tomorrow?

49:25.000 --> 49:26.536
How am I supposed to show my face?

49:26.630 --> 49:28.416
Hey, you don't have to!
You can fucking hide it

49:28.500 --> 49:31.378
in that silver fox stole
you bought yourself last week!

49:31.970 --> 49:35.042
Mommy! She's taking my toy!

49:35.140 --> 49:36.926
Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

49:37.010 --> 49:39.058
You wouldn't believe the stress
I'm dealing with.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.260
I'm going out!

49:52.240 --> 49:54.731
Port Authority
Got two for the H/lton.

49:59.910 --> 50:02.071
Bernie, I’ll take PortAuthor/ty.

50:02.620 --> 50:05.532
Driver, take me
to West Street and 11th.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.239
You got it.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.426
Damn, Loretta, a baby lives here.

50:16.510 --> 50:18.466
You should go outside
if you're gonna smoke.

50:25.850 --> 50:27.226
What happened to you?

50:28.650 --> 50:31.892
Better question.
Ask me what Larry did about it.

50:34.950 --> 50:36.986
The answer? Not a fucking thing.

50:37.070 --> 50:39.823
And if some john put a beating
on you instead of me,

50:40.370 --> 50:43.578
you know he'd be all up
in that guy's shit in a heartbeat.

50:43.660 --> 50:45.491
Well, you need
to take that up with him.

50:45.580 --> 50:47.616
This acting thing with you two?

50:49.210 --> 50:51.121
Taffy and me,
we're like ghosts around here.

50:51.210 --> 50:53.041
What are you talking about?

50:54.260 --> 50:56.876
Larry don't hardly
even fuck me anymore.

50:57.220 --> 50:59.882
It's like living with
the absent-minded professor.

51:01.010 --> 51:04.343
Well, like I said,
that's between you and him.

51:08.310 --> 51:10.858
Well, someone should
make him play a pimp.

51:42.430 --> 51:44.807
- Hey, Cecil.
- Child, what you doing?

51:46.810 --> 51:49.131
Ooh. You said what? Ooh!

51:50.560 --> 51:52.858
- I'll see you around.
- Bye, baby.

51:54.270 --> 51:55.521
Hey.

52:03.370 --> 52:06.533
Yeah, man, yeah.

52:45.780 --> 52:48.943
Right there. Right there.

52:51.120 --> 52:53.918
That's good. That's good.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.400
Seven and Seven.

53:30.750 --> 53:32.286
Hello?

53:35.250 --> 53:38.413
- What's up her ass?
- Annette!

53:39.000 --> 53:40.456
- Yeah?
- Seven and Seven.

53:40.550 --> 53:43.872
I get enough grief at home.
I don't need it here, too.

53:49.060 --> 53:50.459
Here we go.

54:00.780 --> 54:01.895
Hey.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.020
I want him banned.

54:04.910 --> 54:07.982
Why, because of the TV thing?
He didn't deserve that.

54:08.070 --> 54:09.867
He didn't deserve that?

54:10.370 --> 54:12.247
The guy runs
a fucking whorehouse, Vince.

54:12.330 --> 54:15.458
No. He's_ there to make sure
the girls are protected.

54:15.870 --> 54:18.282
He doesn't cheat them.
He doesn't fuck them.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.620
And what the fuck is
your involvement in all this?

54:22.010 --> 54:23.045
Nothing.

54:24.010 --> 54:25.295
Nothing?

54:26.430 --> 54:27.966
Some of those girls
come in here to drink.

54:28.550 --> 54:30.302
And when they do, they talk.

54:30.390 --> 54:32.346
I know all about the envelopes
they're handing you every week.

54:32.430 --> 54:34.478
What? Those envelopes aren't for me.

54:35.980 --> 54:39.552
That's for the building inspectors,
the health inspectors,

54:39.980 --> 54:41.936
the contractors, the cops.

54:42.030 --> 54:43.224
The envelopes I get from you

54:43.320 --> 54:44.810
are no different from the ones
I get from Bobby.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.981
All that money,

54:48.070 --> 54:51.233
that goes to grease the same palms,
it goes into the same pockets.

54:51.830 --> 54:53.650
What are you saying, Vince?

54:54.410 --> 54:56.071
Is this place backed by the Mob?

54:56.960 --> 54:59.076
I never said that.

55:00.340 --> 55:04.253
I'm not even implying that,
all right? Abby.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.121
Abby, you like having
the run of this place?

55:08.550 --> 55:10.882
You like being able to promote
your musician friends?

55:10.970 --> 55:12.005
Your artists?

55:12.640 --> 55:15.177
You like having time and money
to give to your causes?

55:15.640 --> 55:17.096
Then this is how it is.

55:17.190 --> 55:19.977
You cannot walk 10 feet in this city

55:22.820 --> 55:25.607
But if you want me to stop
taking envelopes from Bobby,

55:26.440 --> 55:29.523
fine, I'd be happy to.

55:30.740 --> 55:32.696
In fact, I would love to stop.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.195
I want him banned.

55:35.910 --> 55:38.242
You own the Hi-Hat, fine,

55:38.670 --> 55:40.285
ban whoever you want.

55:40.670 --> 55:43.127
But you don't own the Hi-Hat. I do.

55:43.750 --> 55:46.628
And Bobby's family.
I don't eighty-six family.

55:48.380 --> 55:49.961
Eighty-six this.

56:05.150 --> 56:06.890
"He goes or I go," right?

56:07.490 --> 56:09.230
She serves fucking pimps in here.

56:09.320 --> 56:11.447
All of a sudden
I'm lower than a nigger pimp?

56:11.530 --> 56:14.078
- She's a fucking hypocrite.
- Bobby, I need a favor.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.866
The balls on her.

56:15.950 --> 56:19.829
I need you to stay away
for a few days until it blows over.

56:19.910 --> 56:21.912
And the balls on you
for asking me that!

56:22.040 --> 56:23.746
Two fucking hypocrites in a pod!

56:23.840 --> 56:27.583
I need peace in the kingdom.
For at least a few nights.

56:27.710 --> 56:29.166
Bartender, another.

56:29.970 --> 56:31.506
You know what?

56:31.590 --> 56:33.296
Drinks for everybody on me!

56:41.900 --> 56:42.889
Hey.

56:47.570 --> 56:48.639
Okay.

56:48.740 --> 56:50.196
All right, everyone, let's settle.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.690
Ready to get to your ones?

56:53.240 --> 56:54.480
You ready?

56:56.370 --> 56:57.826
All right.

57:00.290 --> 57:01.655
Let's roll camera.

57:01.750 --> 57:03.490
- Roll sound.
- Sound, speed.

57:03.830 --> 57:05.036
Rolling.

57:05.630 --> 57:06.790
Red Hot.

57:07.460 --> 57:08.449
Scene one...

57:09.960 --> 57:11.086
Take one.

57:15.550 --> 57:16.539
And action.
