WEBVTT

00:34.834 --> 00:35.858
Did you feel that too?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.731
- What?
- Your stomach.

00:37.904 --> 00:38.962
It's like butterflies.

00:39.139 --> 00:42.506
My mom said when I met
the right girl, I'd feel butterflies.

00:42.675 --> 00:43.699
I think I'm ready.

00:46.846 --> 00:47.938
Can you believe him?

00:48.114 --> 00:49.877
He falls so easily.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.449
I'm a little more guarded.

00:51.651 --> 00:55.382
I guess it's because
I've been hurt before.

00:56.623 --> 00:57.988
I'll never hurt you.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.962
- My dad.
- My dad.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.858
- You guys are sisters?
- Our dads are friends.

01:08.034 --> 01:10.002
They went to the gym.
They're muscle-heads.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.162
Your best bet is to curl into a ball
until they stop beating you.

01:13.339 --> 01:16.467
I'm telling you this
because I think I might love you.

01:22.382 --> 01:23.406
What's our play?

01:23.583 --> 01:26.746
Run for the window. I'll get
the car keys. Y formation, dog-leg left.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.751
- Ready, break.
- Break.

01:49.342 --> 01:51.833
We should wait
two days before we call them.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.173
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.911
Do you think they have any concept
of how fast a car can go?

02:09.762 --> 02:12.925
Reverse kitty cat, dog-leg left,
over the fence, on my count, break.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.619
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn. Can we use your pool?

02:51.171 --> 02:54.766
Come on, Tigers. Yeah!

02:54.941 --> 02:57.341
Split Johnny left!
Split Johnny left!

02:57.677 --> 03:01.579
Come on! Come on, guys!
Set. Hike.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.795
Yeah! Yeah! All day. All day.
Candy from a baby.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.958
- What do you wanna do?
- That brunette.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.897
Looks like she wouldn't mind
St. Nick stuffed down her chimney.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.559
No, I mean, the play, in the game.

03:24.737 --> 03:27.297
- Come on, guys, focus.
- I've never been more focused.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.737
Check it, couple of meatloaves
in that baby tee.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.501
Not mad at that belly ring either.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.977
Have you seen this blond?
Rackety-rack, don't talk back.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.809
Wonder if her carpet
matches my drapes.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.848
Delay of game, loss of five yards.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.248
And just because
it's a spring scrimmage...

03:41.421 --> 03:43.981
...doesn't mean you can
shit yourselves out here. Go!

03:44.190 --> 03:46.886
- Sorry, coach.
- Go, go, go. Come on, go, go.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.958
Tigers!

03:49.128 --> 03:51.096
<i>Come on, crowd
Let's hear some noise</i>

03:51.264 --> 03:53.459
<i>N- O-I-S-E
Noise</i>

03:53.633 --> 03:55.294
God. See, look, we took too long.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.663
Here come
the whack-ass cheerleaders, man.

03:57.837 --> 04:01.295
<i>Noise, N-O-I-S-E
Noise</i>

04:01.474 --> 04:02.498
Tigers.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.679
- Well, I am pumped up.
- All right, what's the play?

04:13.853 --> 04:15.980
Hold on,
baby tee is signing me her number.

04:16.154 --> 04:19.851
- Is that a seven? A five and a two?
- Any day now, shit buckets.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.927
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.758
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.329
They playing us loose. Let's
get short passes and extra yardage.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.233
The hell with that, man.
You either bet big or go home.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.640
- You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.
- Aye, my brother.

04:36.809 --> 04:40.677
All right. Pro-zoom trips, deep route,
slant slim boogie on my count. Ready?

04:40.847 --> 04:42.337
Break.

04:42.982 --> 04:44.711
54s and Mike, watch that blitz.

04:45.818 --> 04:48.150
Blue 17, set, hut.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.323
Come on, Shawn.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.290
Come on, baby. Yeah!

05:14.347 --> 05:16.474
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.719
- Hey, Shawn.
- Hey, Maddy.

05:24.891 --> 05:28.019
Thanks for helping me study Bio.
I'm retarded about reverse osmosis.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.218
No, you're not.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.897
Pressure forcing a solvent
through a membrane...

05:32.065 --> 05:35.000
...like when a water balloon
gets too big and then explodes.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.797
Got it. Thanks. You're so awesome.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.632
No. Science is awesome.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.873
And you're awesome.
Now, go crush that test.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.011
- Thanks.
- High five.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.170
Nick. Hey, Nick.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.316
- Name, name. I need a name.
- Jennifer.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.179
- Jennifer, hi, how are you?
- I'm great. Really great.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.887
- Are you going to the bonfire tonight?
- You know it.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.647
I was just saying to Shawn here...

05:57.824 --> 06:00.759
...I cannot wait to go to the bonfire
so I can hang out with...

06:01.327 --> 06:03.386
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.689
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, Jennifer.

06:09.635 --> 06:13.127
- It's not that hard a name to remember.
- I went out with her last semester.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.536
The name gets erased
to make room for new ones.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.303
- There's like 3000 kids at this school.
- Can't you just remember more names?

06:19.479 --> 06:21.310
I don't know how it works.
Talk to Tech Support.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.676
- There are my guys.
- Let's bet how many times...

06:23.850 --> 06:26.080
- ... he says "shit. " I say seven.
- No way, 10.

06:26.252 --> 06:27.480
- Hey, coach.
- Hey, coach.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.143
Shitheads think you're the shit?

06:29.322 --> 06:31.449
That you don't need
to pay attention out there?

06:31.624 --> 06:35.060
I'll kick the shit out of you.
You pumped for football camp?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.219
- I guess so.
- Yeah, two weeks without girls.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.957
- Who wouldn't be pumped?
- Don't mess with me, shit-dick.

06:40.466 --> 06:43.094
I am gonna push you like you've
never been pushed before.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.328
Your muscles will ache,
your head will throb.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.996
You'll shit blood out of holes
you never knew you had.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.535
At least we're gonna
be in Daytona Beach.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.771
No. Change it up this year.
Camp's gonna be in El Paso, Texas.

06:54.947 --> 06:56.778
Hotter than your shithole.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.008
We're gonna get
you shits conditioned.

06:59.185 --> 07:02.154
Bus leaves Monday
at 0-shit-hundred hours.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.414
- Which is?
-4:45 a. m.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.023
- Of course.
- The usual.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.956
Skip your morning shit
and get down here.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.221
Ten "shits," you win.
How do you always know?

07:13.399 --> 07:16.197
It's a gift. I'm not proud of it.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.427
Bye.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.066
Maybe I'll see you
sometime this summer.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.840
Don't be obvious.
He knows you like him.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.842
You guys coming
to my dad's after camp?

07:27.013 --> 07:29.174
- Hells, yeah. He gave it to you again?
- Nice.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.339
He figures if he lets
me have it one week...

07:31.517 --> 07:34.145
...I'll forgive him for not being there
when I need him.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.550
And guess what. He's right.

07:37.156 --> 07:40.557
Did you hear football camp's gonna
be in El Paso? How cool is that?

07:40.726 --> 07:43.217
We gonna be sweating, hallucinating,
our skin burning.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.864
Like being on shrooms,
but without girls to yell at us.

07:46.032 --> 07:50.662
"Where's the car? Where's the car?
I'm getting scared. Hold my purse. "

07:52.538 --> 07:55.871
- Two weeks, Shawn. Two weeks.
- I know.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.035
Two weeks out of the best
years of our lives.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.612
Two weeks we're never
gonna get back, like, ever.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.146
I know.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.080
So are you guys psyched
for cheer camp or what?

08:06.252 --> 08:07.685
It's, like, all I think about.

08:07.854 --> 08:10.948
Know how Martin Luther King
had a dream? Well, I do too.

08:11.123 --> 08:15.423
To kick ass at cheer camp. And if
that makes me shallow, then fine.

08:15.595 --> 08:19.395
- Call me and Dr. King shallow.
- That doesn't make you shallow.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.495
That makes you real.

08:22.134 --> 08:24.102
We have got to do better
than last year.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.967
We could take a dump in our pants
and still do better than last year.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.540
- I'm just saying.
- But we're better this year.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.770
And if we work hard,
I think we have a real shot.

08:33.946 --> 08:36.140
I don't know.
There's 300 girls up there...

08:36.315 --> 08:38.306
...who want it just as much
as we do.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.078
- And who are much better than us.
- Three hundred girls.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.052
Who want it just as much as we do.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.986
And are much better than us.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.724
Tell you what, man,
that'd be the place to be.

08:49.896 --> 08:53.229
Instead of sweating our balls off
in the desert with Coach Shit-Shit.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.561
- So let's go.
- What?

08:57.737 --> 08:59.568
Let's go to cheer camp,
be cheerleaders.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.366
- Cheerleaders?
- Yes.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.566
Oh, my God.
Are you coming out to me?

09:03.743 --> 09:05.370
I'm so proud of you, man.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.843
And you know what,
I kind of always knew.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.574
Will you shut up. All right,
I'm too straight to be gay.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.650
I could suck knob
and still be straight.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.082
I could have one in my mouth
and two in each hand...

09:15.254 --> 09:17.654
- ... and still win a straight award.
- All right.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.451
Which is why I wanna go
to cheer camp. Think.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.857
Three hundred hotties
we've never been with before.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.225
I wonder if they let guys
go to cheer camp.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.591
Name, name. Give me a name.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.633
- Carly. She's the captain.
- Hey, Carly.

09:30.803 --> 09:34.364
Yeah, I know, it's the most beautiful
name you've ever heard...

09:34.574 --> 09:36.166
...my eyes look like forever...

09:36.342 --> 09:39.470
...and you love every bone in my body,
especially yours.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.545
No, but that's good.
Mind if I use it?

09:41.714 --> 09:42.942
No, no. No lines.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.049
We wanted to wish you
luck at cheer camp.

09:45.217 --> 09:48.482
Sure, you do. I know your game.
No girl left unturned.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.320
- What?
- How dare you?

09:50.489 --> 09:53.049
No. We just see how hard
you ladies cheer out there...

09:53.225 --> 09:55.090
...and we really hope
that you do good.

09:55.261 --> 09:59.254
Yeah, do us proud, you know. Beat
the skirts off those 300 other girls.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.458
And guys? Are there guys there?
Do guys go?

10:02.635 --> 10:04.933
- What about guys?
- It's a good question.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.629
There's girls and guys that go.
I don't know if guys-

10:07.807 --> 10:09.741
Yes. The good teams are all co-ed.

10:09.942 --> 10:13.309
That's interesting. I just didn't
know that. I was just pondering.

10:13.479 --> 10:16.778
Carly, come here. We're working on
a new mount Bianca came up with.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.974
- Yeah!
- Coming.

10:19.418 --> 10:23.149
I'm gonna walk away backwards,
so you guys don't talk about my ass.

10:23.322 --> 10:26.155
Man, she's got nice lumps.
Either one of us ever hit that?

10:26.325 --> 10:28.987
I don't think so. I think
she respects herself too much.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.287
Right.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.226
Who wants to deal with that drama?

10:32.465 --> 10:35.229
So, what do you think
about cheer camp?

10:35.401 --> 10:37.596
- What do you mean, what do I think?
- Let's go.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.637
- We're not cheerleaders.
- We're athletes, we can do anything.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.741
They don't just let anybody go.
You've gotta be part of a squad.

10:43.909 --> 10:45.774
Let's join a squad.
How hard can this be?

10:45.945 --> 10:47.708
A couple of flips, a pyramid.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.040
<i>Black sheep</i>

10:49.215 --> 10:50.944
Three hundred honeys
on our biscuits.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.086
- What about football camp?
- Screw football.

10:54.253 --> 10:57.120
The only reason we started playing
was to pull chicks.

10:57.289 --> 11:00.656
You can't honestly tell me you enjoy
running in blazing hot pads...

11:00.826 --> 11:04.193
...trying to catch a pass two seconds
before some 2000-pound mongoloid...

11:04.363 --> 11:07.594
- ... crashes into your Nutter Butters.
- El Paso, here we come.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.133
Not if it comes to us first!

11:11.037 --> 11:12.527
Oh, shit.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.137
- I'm on fire.
- Mookie!

11:14.306 --> 11:17.332
- Water, water, water.
- I'll put you out.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.943
I'm a hero.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.944
Screw football. Let's go cheer.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.177
Shawny Shawn!

11:25.751 --> 11:27.742
We need to convince
the squad they need us.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.218
- Not gonna be easy.
- That's why we go to Poppy.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.380
- I wish there was another way.
- There's not.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.958
- But I wish there was.
- But there's not. We're here.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.595
- I wish we weren't.
- But we are.

11:39.298 --> 11:41.061
Hi, sis.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.064
Why am I looking at you? Speak.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.499
Poppy, you're getting so big now.
How old are you?

11:45.671 --> 11:48.231
I'm 60. Can we get past
the small talk?

11:48.407 --> 11:51.968
The only time you come to see me
is when you need something.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.736
What? Tug mags?

11:53.913 --> 11:55.710
Mike's Hard Lemonade?

11:56.048 --> 11:58.448
- Another ride to the clinic?
- Poppy.

12:00.286 --> 12:03.983
No. We wanna go to that
cheerleading camp you're going to.

12:04.156 --> 12:07.489
Since you're killing on the JV squad
and so advanced beyond your years...

12:07.660 --> 12:09.321
...we thought you'd get us
up to speed.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.520
Hey, buddy,
you can piss on my face...

12:11.697 --> 12:13.221
...just don't tell me it's raining.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.000
You guys have been through
every girl at your school...

12:17.169 --> 12:19.228
...and you're looking
for fresh muff.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.930
Some itchy-itchy-nah-nah.
Wall-to-wall carpet.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.167
Okay, seriously, how old are you?

12:24.343 --> 12:27.506
Tell you what, I'll teach you
some basic cheerleader moves.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.841
High V's, low V's,
touchdown, baskets.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.984
Don't the guys just throw
the girls up and then catch them?

12:33.152 --> 12:36.747
Pretty much. But I'll let you practice
on me and tell you what they're called.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.981
In exchange, I get Shawn's room.

12:39.158 --> 12:40.284
- No.
- Done.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.858
Those are my terms.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.188
- We'll take them.
- Dude, I've got my own bathroom.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.297
Dude, after cheer camp, you won't
even need your own bathroom.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.092
What? What does that even mean?

12:49.268 --> 12:51.964
Poppy, you got yourself a deal.
Teach us, we go see Carly.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.072
- Wrong, Gossip Girl.
- What?

12:54.240 --> 12:57.141
Carly's not one of your humpety-hump
football groupies.

12:57.309 --> 13:00.403
She's too smart to buy that you guys
wanna be cheerleaders.

13:00.579 --> 13:01.944
Okay, so, what's the play?

13:09.755 --> 13:12.588
- Here she comes, here she comes.
- Go, go. Get up there.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.490
Oh, rats.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.322
- We got our Frisbee stuck.
- How are we gonna get it down?

13:17.496 --> 13:19.555
- Go space shuttle.
- That's what I'm thinking.

13:19.765 --> 13:20.993
Good idea.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.032
- Ready?
- Okay.

13:23.202 --> 13:29.107
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six
Seven, grab, drop, catch</i>

13:31.277 --> 13:32.869
- Great job.
- Go, buddy.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.910
Do they always get
so excited like that?

13:35.080 --> 13:37.640
Haven't you ever seen them
do their touchdown dances?

13:37.817 --> 13:41.947
I mean, they flip all over the place.
You'd think they were cheerleaders.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.089
- No.
- You guys really like cheering?

13:44.256 --> 13:46.224
That wasn't cheering,
just goofing around.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.360
You nailed a backward sponge
and go cradle.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.087
No. We threw my sister up in the air
to get our Frisbee.

13:51.263 --> 13:53.356
It was either that
or we get three ladders.

13:53.532 --> 13:54.556
Come on, guys.

13:54.733 --> 13:59.170
You love cheering. Don't run from it.
This is a safe place.

14:00.639 --> 14:03.199
We kind of do. It's so much
more athletic than football.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.469
If it were up to us, we'd go
with you ladies to cheer camp.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.408
But we're football meatheads.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.106
We gotta march in lockstep
to what society expects.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.877
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Totally ruin our rep.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.044
- We'll catch you later.
- Have a good summer.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.213
We're gonna go watch
a Bears' game on TV.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.483
<i>Go, Bears</i>

14:32.838 --> 14:35.329
I'm supposed to believe
the biggest jocks in school...

14:35.541 --> 14:37.668
...all along really wanted
to be cheerleaders?

14:37.843 --> 14:41.040
Don't get caught up in the lockstep
of society's expectations.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.147
They tossed Poppy
like 20 feet in the air.

14:43.315 --> 14:45.613
Look, Carly,
we don't have any muscle.

14:45.784 --> 14:49.345
If you really wanna do better this year,
they're our only hope.

14:49.922 --> 14:52.789
Unless you guys wanna try steroids,
which I'm totally open to.

14:53.692 --> 14:57.059
- I'm just saying.
- I don't care. I don't trust those guys.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.593
They're not coming. I'm the captain.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.563
Miss Klingerhoff is the coach.
Let's see what she thinks.

15:05.137 --> 15:08.038
What a fantastic idea.

15:08.674 --> 15:12.474
It's exactly what this squad needs
to just push it over the top.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.113
But Miss Klingerhoff,
they have never done it before.

15:15.281 --> 15:20.241
They don't know any of our cheers,
and, come on, it's Nick and Shawn.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.387
Don't judge a book
by its cover, Carly.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.957
You never really know what a book
is about until you get to page 50.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.991
Fifty?

15:29.161 --> 15:32.790
- Wouldn't guess a page over 40.
- More like 35.

15:33.966 --> 15:34.990
My chickens.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.532
You come here, you.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.140
All right. One down, one to go.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.508
What are we gonna say to Coach
Shit-For-Words to get out of football?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.673
What every kid says to get out
of everything he doesn't wanna do.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.714
So not only do I find out yesterday
I'm adopted...

15:56.889 --> 15:59.881
...the people I've called mom and
dad are infertile imposters...

16:00.059 --> 16:03.153
...who bought me outside a meth clinic
for two boxes of Sudafed...

16:03.329 --> 16:05.661
...but I also get
this news dropped on me:

16:05.998 --> 16:08.523
My birth father, Bruce...

16:09.201 --> 16:12.068
...well, he needs a kidney
and I'm the only match.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.330
And apparently Bruce needs it stat.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.475
You need it stat, Bruce? Huh?

16:17.676 --> 16:20.406
I needed a father stat
instead of the stay-at-home dad...

16:20.579 --> 16:23.912
...who showers me with love every
day, this goddamn spermless liar!

16:25.351 --> 16:28.343
So now I gotta be at Kaiser
Permanente tomorrow at 6 a. m.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.955
I know. Bruce couldn't even afford
a real hospital.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.785
Managed care. It's ironic, huh?

16:35.394 --> 16:37.123
Never managed to care for me.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.196
You shitting me?

16:39.365 --> 16:41.458
Are you saying you can't go to camp?

16:41.633 --> 16:43.863
Yeah, but don't make me say it,
coach.

16:44.036 --> 16:48.405
Because it's eating me up inside.
It's eating me up.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.841
Shit!

16:53.812 --> 16:55.046
- Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
- One, two.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.280
- Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
- One, two.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.040
Cheer camp! One, two.

16:58.884 --> 17:01.444
You might have everyone else fooled,
but not me.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.182
Well, if being a fool
for cheering is wrong...

17:04.990 --> 17:06.548
...then I don't wanna be right.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.193
You might wanna dial back
your bullshit with her.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.657
She seems pretty with-it.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.023
That's a great note. Thanks.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.234
We're so psyched you're here.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.464
- Yeah, us too. Oh, yeah.
- Me too, yeah, yeah.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.799
Don't worry about Carly.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.000
- She's really into cheering.
- No worries.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.509
<i>We are driving
We, we are driving</i>

17:28.012 --> 17:31.278
<i>We are driving
We, we are driving</i>

17:31.450 --> 17:34.351
<i>We like driving
We, we like driving</i>

17:34.753 --> 17:38.189
<i>We like driving
We, we like driving</i>

17:38.357 --> 17:41.520
<i>- We are eating
- We, we are eating</i>

17:41.727 --> 17:45.094
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

17:45.264 --> 17:48.028
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

17:48.200 --> 17:51.260
- How long does this go on for?
- The whole way.

17:51.437 --> 17:55.032
Just wait till their cycles match up.
You'll miss these days.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.105
We're gonna miss
Mookie's dad's house.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.870
Oh, buddy, we are not missing
Mookie's dad's house.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.842
Yeah.
This thing is three weeks long.

18:02.014 --> 18:06.110
Not for us, it isn't. We hook up
like maniacs, we bail in two.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.621
That's probably gonna piss
some people off.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.847
To make an omelet,
you gotta break some eggs.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.323
Grated cheese, slice some mushrooms,
salt, pepper, don't over-beat.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.485
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

18:18.263 --> 18:21.494
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

18:21.667 --> 18:23.794
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

18:23.969 --> 18:25.095
Sorry.

18:25.270 --> 18:29.229
I should say so, handsy.
At least buy me dinner first.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.932
Very funny.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.373
All right, now you're just
taking advantage of me.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.849
<i>We are here
We, we are here</i>

18:45.090 --> 18:46.489
I think we made a big mistake.

18:46.658 --> 18:48.683
We may have screwed the pooch
on this one.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.996
Or maybe the pooch
is gonna screw us.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.689
Sweet Mary in a D-cup.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.207
I think our bus crashed
and we're in heaven.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.478
No. We would've heard:

19:43.649 --> 19:47.346
<i>"We are crashing
We, we are crashing"</i>

19:48.253 --> 19:50.483
Let's go see how warm the water is.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.318
- Hi. Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.984
Well, I'm Nick. I'm new this year.
Maybe you could show me around.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.562
- Who's this?
- Nick. He's new this year.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.959
This is Shawn, also new,
needs showing around.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.568
- If it's not too much trouble.
- You gotta check in.

20:04.736 --> 20:05.828
Okay, coming.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.564
It was very nice meeting you.
Hope we see you around.

20:08.740 --> 20:12.176
I'll put a bookmark between you.
That way we know where we left off.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.077
Hi. What squad are you on?

20:23.388 --> 20:27.154
<i>Diora. I believe that's Italiano
for "beautiful princess. "</i>

20:27.392 --> 20:28.586
- No.
- Well, it should be.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.490
- I'm calling the dictionary people.
- What squad are you on?

20:31.663 --> 20:33.130
The Tigers, Gerald R. Ford High.

20:33.298 --> 20:36.062
Below-average president,
above-average student body.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.430
So, what are you doing later?

20:38.604 --> 20:40.037
Not you.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.367
What about accents?
You like Aussies?

20:42.541 --> 20:43.940
You wanna wear my leather hat?

20:44.676 --> 20:48.476
Mascots, I'll be checking you in
in 10 minutes at the mascot table.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.283
- Why are you still here?
- You like canopy beds?

20:54.720 --> 20:57.848
The last bus from Bitchville
just pulled in.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.826
- Who's that?
- The Panthers.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.055
They always come in first
and they don't let anyone forget it.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.534
You guys came back.
I think that's so brave.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.238
I just hope one day
there's a special cheer camp...

21:15.440 --> 21:18.238
...where squads like yours
really have a shot.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.467
- Shut up.
- Truth hurts.

21:19.645 --> 21:22.136
- Your face is gonna hurt.
- Does your face hurt...

21:22.314 --> 21:25.613
- ... when you stuff it with pie?
- You wish you had my body image.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.753
I'm healthy. Unlike you, Skeletor.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.154
We're a different team this year,
Gwyneth.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.917
Meet our new squad members.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.389
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.084
Hi. Great to meet you.

21:37.529 --> 21:41.989
So you got a little sausage
in your soup this year. BFD.

21:42.534 --> 21:45.332
- See you on the cheer field.
- It's that big chunk of grass...

21:45.504 --> 21:47.131
...you come in last on, every year.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.103
Panthers out.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.248
Panthers out?

21:59.418 --> 22:00.976
What are they, a knife gang?

22:01.186 --> 22:03.916
- God, I hate them.
- I think they're kind of cool.

22:05.223 --> 22:06.815
I'm just saying.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.935
Hey. I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

22:19.638 --> 22:20.935
I'm Brewster.

22:22.107 --> 22:23.165
Not my real name.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.969
My parents named me Jack.

22:25.143 --> 22:29.637
Jack, so strong, so masculine.
We get it. You wanted a boy.

22:29.815 --> 22:33.581
My name's Jack. I punch bad guys,
and I kiss girls.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.652
- Save it.
- Okay.

22:35.821 --> 22:40.258
<i>Now, just a quick FY información,
I'm kind of a neat freak...</i>

22:40.425 --> 22:45.453
...so we'll get along great if you
just keep your area clean.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.756
And by "area," you mean?

22:46.932 --> 22:48.900
- Your bunks.
- Okay.

22:49.067 --> 22:51.433
I can't stand clutter.
That's why we left Calcutta.

22:51.603 --> 22:54.436
Well, that and my dad
took a job with United Airlines.

22:54.606 --> 22:57.040
Your jobs aren't just
going over there, sailor.

22:57.209 --> 23:01.111
Some of us are coming over here.
The world is flat like a son of a bitch.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.577
You're giving us a lot to process here.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.015
Hey, what's up, guys? I'm Adam.

23:07.185 --> 23:09.449
What's up, man?
Hey, I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

23:10.422 --> 23:11.480
Well, welcome, welcome.

23:11.656 --> 23:14.147
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

23:14.793 --> 23:17.455
That's Jody. We've been cheering
together since we were 5.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.892
So you take this seriously?

23:20.065 --> 23:23.501
I wanna be the first in my family to
go to college on a cheer scholarship.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.034
Good luck, man.
I hope you break the cycle.

23:26.204 --> 23:27.364
- Thanks, man.
- Cool.

23:27.539 --> 23:28.563
What's up, Eagle?

23:29.975 --> 23:32.409
Mascots don't talk. They just gesture.

23:32.577 --> 23:35.603
- Even in their bunks?
- The whole time, baby girl.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.713
It's total immersion.

23:37.883 --> 23:39.908
Hey. Can someone
help me with my stuff?

23:40.118 --> 23:43.417
I got a huge bag of footballs,
beer, Xbox games.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.919
Let's get this party started.

23:45.123 --> 23:47.523
Finally, a kindred spirit.
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

23:47.692 --> 23:49.717
- I'm Downey.
- What's up? Nice to meet you.

23:49.895 --> 23:53.023
Downey. Downey. All right,
so break it down for us.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.098
How great is this place?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.599
- It's sick, dude.
- Sweet. Right there.

23:57.769 --> 24:01.102
The coaches are amazing. Your
cheering's gonna be off the charts.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.333
My cheering's gonna be off the charts.
I guess that's a good thing.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.773
What about the ladies?
Tell me about the ladies.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.072
Oh, yeah, totally.

24:11.049 --> 24:13.449
Their cheering gets better too.
They see real progress.

24:16.087 --> 24:17.111
What the...?

24:18.256 --> 24:22.886
Wow, look at them all, dude. In rows.
It's like the hot-chick produce aisle.

24:23.094 --> 24:24.459
I don't know where to start.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.257
Do we go from tall to short
or blond to redhead?

24:27.432 --> 24:29.457
Maybe just iPod-shuffle mode.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.899
This is why I'd never wanna
be president. Too many decisions.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.232
Don't worry,
I don't think that's in the cards.

24:35.407 --> 24:39.400
You say that now, but George W.
was a cheerleader at Yale.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.273
He never thought
he'd be president...

24:41.446 --> 24:44.745
...snorting coke through his skull and
bones at a New Haven titty bar.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.577
You just never know, Shawnzy.

24:46.751 --> 24:50.187
And that is what makes America great.
Any idiot can be president.

24:50.355 --> 24:53.324
- Let's hear some noise over here!
- Noise over here!

24:53.492 --> 24:56.017
- Let's hear some noise over here!
- Noise over here!

24:56.194 --> 24:58.594
- Are you fired up?
- We're fired up!

24:58.763 --> 25:01.061
- Are you fired up?
- We're fired up!

25:01.233 --> 25:03.064
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

25:03.235 --> 25:04.566
Not really.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.863
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

25:07.038 --> 25:08.972
- What's that spell?
- Fired up!

25:09.174 --> 25:10.698
- Not really that way either.
- Nope.

25:10.876 --> 25:14.209
Damn straight. F-U.
You're at university now.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.108
- Fired Up University.
- This is awesome.

25:16.314 --> 25:19.579
Cheer college, my friends. None
of this high school stuff for you.

25:19.751 --> 25:23.585
You got three weeks. We're gonna
take it right to the top to F-U.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.882
- F-U!
- F-U!

25:28.093 --> 25:31.324
Howdy do? My name is Coach Keith.
I'm the skipper of this spirit ship.

25:31.496 --> 25:35.125
As many of you know, I was
the very first male cheerleader ever...

25:35.300 --> 25:37.268
...to compete at the Nationals.

25:37.435 --> 25:39.335
I was born cheering.

25:39.504 --> 25:42.064
My mother swears
the first thing out of her what's-it...

25:42.240 --> 25:44.970
...was a little pair of baby hands
doing spirit fingers.

25:48.246 --> 25:50.339
That's a joke, but it really happened.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.384
It is now my absolute pleasure...

25:53.552 --> 25:55.611
...to introduce to you
your head counselor...

25:55.787 --> 26:00.224
...and my super-sexy handsome wife,
Diora. Let's bring her out here.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.829
- What? Did he say wife?
- No, he couldn't have.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.023
Welcome, everyone.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.761
For the next three weeks, you'll train
with me and the other coaches...

26:12.938 --> 26:14.735
...and then compete in a tournament...

26:14.906 --> 26:18.342
...with the top teams going on
to the State Finals.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.842
So that would be the Panthers
and two other teams.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.318
- Oh, me, me, me.
- Yes, ma'am, right here.

26:28.486 --> 26:32.047
I heard that there was this really hard
move called the Fountain of Troy...

26:32.223 --> 26:33.986
...that some team did at the Worlds.

26:34.192 --> 26:35.352
Are we gonna learn that?

26:35.527 --> 26:38.496
Sure, I'll teach you
how to do the Fountain of Troy.

26:39.664 --> 26:42.656
Then I'll teach you
to put makeup on a bear!

26:43.201 --> 26:44.862
Absolutely not.

26:45.036 --> 26:48.699
Not only is that move nearly impossible
to execute, it's extremely dangerous.

26:48.907 --> 26:50.670
That move is prohibidado.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.934
- Prohibi-what?
- Prohibidado.

26:53.111 --> 26:57.775
And I say that in Spanish because
that's how exotic and not-allowed it is.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.713
You can't even say "Fountain of Troy"
at this cheer camp.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.285
- Go ahead and say it.
- Fountain of Tr-!

27:03.455 --> 27:06.083
Stop it. What are you doing?
This isn't a game.

27:06.257 --> 27:07.849
I'm not playing around up here.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.186
Honey.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.824
It's just a joke.
First week of cheer camp.

27:13.398 --> 27:14.456
Lighten things up.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.124
Have a good time.
Everybody say it, "Fountain of Troy. "

27:17.302 --> 27:20.362
- Fountain of Tr-!
- Oh, my dear Lord! Oh, gosh, shut up!

27:20.538 --> 27:22.369
He's lost his mind.

27:22.540 --> 27:25.373
Stop it! Nobody does the
Fountain of Troy at this cheer camp.

27:25.543 --> 27:28.068
Now, let's all hit the bunks
and get a good night's sleep.

27:28.246 --> 27:29.474
Welcome to cheer camp.

27:41.626 --> 27:42.650
Hi.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.522
Dibs, dibs. Dibs on the blond
with the butterfly tattoo.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.826
Dibs on that. I'd like that.
Tell me who it is.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.094
- This is Lanie Brown.
- Lanie Brown.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.501
She likes skiing, hip-hop, and playing
with her cat, Sir Pembleton.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.074
- Sir Pembleton? You serious?
- I know, I'm not kidding.

27:58.276 --> 28:00.506
I'm gonna write her name
in my book in no time.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.579
Can't believe you document
your conquests.

28:02.747 --> 28:05.011
Family owns a payroll company.
Love records.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.174
- It's just weird.
- Tell it to our dog, FICA.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.512
Oh, hey, Carly.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.018
What's up, Tigers?

28:10.388 --> 28:12.015
- Hey.
- Going to take a shower?

28:12.190 --> 28:14.715
Yeah. I had my hand
in some kid's mouth this morning.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.587
Good idea. I know where it's been.

28:17.762 --> 28:20.595
And if I don't get some
flesh-eating virus from that...

28:20.765 --> 28:23.029
...I probably will
after I take a shower barefoot.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.862
- I forgot to pack my flip-flops.
- Sucks! See you later.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.629
Oh, here. Take mine.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.372
- I brought two pair.
- Really?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.103
Yeah. No problem.
We're teammates.

28:34.679 --> 28:35.737
Thanks.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.347
- Bye.
- See you later.

28:42.387 --> 28:46.255
Bro, what did I tell you? No hooking
up with girls from our school.

28:46.424 --> 28:48.551
- I was just being nice.
- I don't care, man.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.058
You know where nice leads.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.321
Do not poop where you eat,
remember?

28:52.530 --> 28:56.660
That's why there are no
restaurants called The Bathroom.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.498
There are bathrooms at restaurants.

29:00.038 --> 29:01.630
I was using a metaphor, Shawn.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.674
It is crazy that people think
that you're the smart one.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.270
What's up, ladies?

29:08.446 --> 29:09.708
Hi.

29:09.881 --> 29:12.975
You wanna borrow some flip-flops?
All right, see you later.

29:17.989 --> 29:20.890
Welcome to day one, everybody.
Let's start with a warm-up run.

29:21.192 --> 29:24.889
God, she's such a fox. I guarantee
I'm gonna tap that before we leave.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.923
Dude, she's married,
and like 30 years old.

29:28.099 --> 29:31.227
That's just how I like them:
ancient and regretful.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.529
Yeah. Take it easy on the Dove bars.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.536
- Ready, Shawnzy?
- Sure am, Nicholai.

29:35.707 --> 29:36.799
New guys, move them.

29:41.012 --> 29:43.640
I always knew there was
something else I should be doing.

29:43.815 --> 29:46.306
You know,
like there was something more.

29:47.252 --> 29:49.152
Something more inside me.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.380
I guess you could say
I had a cheer waiting to get out.

29:54.092 --> 29:57.084
And now, well, I live to cheer.

29:58.396 --> 30:01.388
And I cheer to live.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.905
I looked that little kitten
in the eyes...

30:09.073 --> 30:10.802
...and I knew I had to take her home.

30:10.975 --> 30:15.378
And now, Sniffles,
that's who I tell my secrets to.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.481
My grandmother was a cheerleader.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.742
It was what she loved most
in the world.

30:20.118 --> 30:25.215
So when she died, I just
picked up the family pom-poms.

30:25.390 --> 30:28.689
This is weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.523
It's weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.056
<i>Tigers!</i>

31:00.692 --> 31:02.683
I love every bone in your body.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.954
Especially mine...?

31:28.553 --> 31:29.679
<i>Tigers!</i>

31:42.934 --> 31:46.426
<i>Tigers can't be beat
Get up on your feet</i>

31:46.604 --> 31:48.196
<i>Tigers can't be beat</i>

31:48.373 --> 31:51.240
Is it my imagination, or do they
not completely, totally suck?

31:51.409 --> 31:53.206
It's your imagination.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.243
Now go imagine me
a bottle of water.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.739
<i>Tigers!</i>

32:05.924 --> 32:08.916
The French say a day moon brings
good luck to whoever sees it.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.118
They also say 8-year-olds
should drink wine.

32:11.296 --> 32:14.925
And if it's a crescent moon,
it'll bring good luck for a week.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.265
What is it now?

32:17.435 --> 32:21.201
I'm jogging with the captain of the best
squad, so I'd say it's pretty crescent.

32:21.372 --> 32:23.135
- Race you.
- Cheering isn't a race.

32:23.308 --> 32:26.243
- This isn't football.
- There's a competition at the end.

32:26.411 --> 32:29.574
Yeah, you're right.
On your mark, get set...

32:29.747 --> 32:31.715
Oh, she cheats. I like it.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.043
Zucchini?

32:33.918 --> 32:36.785
Leafy greens? Kale? Jicama?

32:36.988 --> 32:38.012
And sprouts?

32:38.189 --> 32:40.521
That's the only thing
that sucks about cheer camp.

32:40.725 --> 32:42.454
The sacrifices
I make for ass.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.629
Remember when I pretended to
be into Nickelback for that chick?

32:45.797 --> 32:48.766
- God, they suck.
- So did she. Up top.

32:48.933 --> 32:52.596
Dude, I am not gonna high-five you
for a beejer you got a year ago.

32:53.037 --> 32:54.698
That doesn't count. No.

32:55.873 --> 32:57.238
- Poppy.
- Hi, sis.

32:57.408 --> 32:59.069
Guys looking to go off-menu?

32:59.243 --> 33:02.371
I got Kit Kats, Snickers,
and German sweet tarts.

33:03.014 --> 33:04.948
Wipes out the taste
of every other candy.

33:07.385 --> 33:09.216
I'll take everything you got.

33:09.554 --> 33:12.580
Not here, Shawshank.
The screws are watching.

33:12.757 --> 33:15.590
Put it in the sycamore tree
out back.

33:16.361 --> 33:18.727
- Where's our candy gonna be?
- Check your pockets.

33:23.301 --> 33:26.065
I know. She's got the shine.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.405
Oh, my God, this is so good.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.269
Yeah, it is.

33:37.115 --> 33:38.139
Diora!

33:41.686 --> 33:43.244
Diora!

33:44.589 --> 33:45.613
God, it is you.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.690
The way the moonlight
caught your cheek...

33:47.859 --> 33:50.191
...for a second there,
I thought you were an angel.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.352
Nope, just the head
counselor who decides...

33:52.530 --> 33:54.930
...whether or not to make you
run laps all tomorrow.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.366
God, I love it, huh?

33:58.569 --> 34:01.697
A little back and forth, witty repartee,
Hepburn and Tracy.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.864
I'm not 16, kiddo.
Run along and play.

34:04.108 --> 34:06.303
Still with the witty repartee,
that's terrific.

34:06.477 --> 34:09.913
- You win this round, Miss Tracy.
- Hepburn was the girl.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.878
Ding, ding. Knockout.

34:15.485 --> 34:17.954
It shouldn't be this hard,
she's like 100 years old.

34:18.356 --> 34:21.951
- Shawn. Got a second?
- Yeah. Sure.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.688
Some of the girls have been
talking about you and Nick.

34:25.862 --> 34:27.922
Don't believe anything anyone says.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.500
They've been saying they think this is
the best the team has ever been.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.935
Well, that you can believe.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.835
I just wanted to say thanks.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.335
You guys have been a big help.

34:40.143 --> 34:41.668
Especially you.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.712
Thanks.

34:44.882 --> 34:48.373
It's nice to know that when I get tossed,
you're gonna be there to catch me.

34:48.553 --> 34:50.453
I mean, not that Bianca wasn't good.

34:50.621 --> 34:54.351
It's just, I don't know. You feel right.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.652
I like it too.
You're like a home-run ball.

34:56.828 --> 35:00.662
Fifteen-inch brown trout.
A mild cold. Double feature.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.857
I get it. Things that you catch.
Shut up.

35:03.334 --> 35:04.528
I know at the beginning...

35:04.702 --> 35:07.466
...I may have been against
you two joining the squad-

35:07.638 --> 35:10.038
I believe you called us
"godless douche-monsters. "

35:10.208 --> 35:12.005
It was "soulless beav-wranglers. "

35:12.210 --> 35:15.008
Well, that's better.
I totally misunderstood you.

35:15.179 --> 35:16.544
I'm trying to apologize here.

35:16.714 --> 35:18.944
No need. And accepted.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.412
Hey.

35:25.356 --> 35:28.883
You'd think as a cheerleader
I would be a little more graceful.

35:29.927 --> 35:33.328
I like you clumsy.
It's like I'm looking behind the curtain.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.926
Babe.

35:38.736 --> 35:39.794
Rick.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.735
Rick.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.410
- Who's the face-eater?
- Guys, come meet my boyfriend.

35:49.046 --> 35:52.311
- What is with that car?
- Maybe he won an LPGA tournament.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.919
I missed you.

36:01.092 --> 36:03.253
Me too. Definitely.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.292
Guys, this is my boyfriend.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.660
- Pre-fiancé, actually.
- These are the guys I told you about.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.631
- Nick and Shawn.
- What's up, guys? I'm Dr. Rick.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.029
Really?

36:16.641 --> 36:17.665
Pound?

36:17.842 --> 36:19.901
Aren't you a little young
to be a doctor?

36:20.077 --> 36:22.341
- He's pre-med.
- Then why call yourself "doctor"?

36:22.513 --> 36:23.946
Why put off the inevitable?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.985
You should get
that mole checked out.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.815
I'd do it myself,
but I don't have my bag on me.

36:32.657 --> 36:34.124
Your book bag?

36:34.292 --> 36:37.557
- How'd you two crazy kids meet, Rick?
- It's a funny story, actually.

36:37.762 --> 36:41.664
Our parents knew each other from
way back, and they introduced us.

36:45.503 --> 36:49.462
Not that funny a story. Not really
even a story. Just like a fact.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.968
We've been going out
since I was a sophomore.

36:52.176 --> 36:56.044
We should hit it, Carly. I told the guys
we'd be done dinner in 45.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.511
- The guys are with you?
- It was a long-ass drive, babe.

36:59.684 --> 37:02.812
You didn't want me falling asleep
at the wheel, did you?

37:02.987 --> 37:04.545
No, I'm glad you made it.

37:04.722 --> 37:08.021
Yeah, you're glad.
I got a rezzy at Red Lobster.

37:08.192 --> 37:11.252
We've got a booth in the back
behind a plant...

37:11.429 --> 37:14.489
...so no one can see how much
we're all-you-can-eating.

37:15.032 --> 37:17.227
If you know what I'm saying, boys.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.003
Okay. Oh, Shawn.
I have something for you.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.408
Sweet deal you kids
got going on here.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.342
Wish I could hang out,
play all summer.

37:30.781 --> 37:33.716
I'm just a little busy
picking my specialty.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.011
Specialty? You're a freshman.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.951
Your specialty should be putting a cow
in the dean's office.

37:39.123 --> 37:41.387
<i>Animal House reference. Love it!</i>

37:44.829 --> 37:47.389
My mom sent mine,
so I don't need yours anymore.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.294
- Thanks.
- Sure.

37:50.801 --> 37:55.261
And, chief. Next time, if my girl needs
something, she can borrow it from me.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.404
Rick, he was just being nice.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.101
Those feet look pretty small.
What are they, a seven?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.871
Ten and a half, papo.

38:03.814 --> 38:05.941
Eleven in Crocs.

38:14.191 --> 38:17.319
What's the name of that girl
who was 5'7", blond hair, blue eyes?

38:17.495 --> 38:19.656
She's like a dragon.
Reminds me of Christmas.

38:20.798 --> 38:24.359
It's Carols, Care-holes, Car-
Caroline. Caroline.

38:24.602 --> 38:26.570
I'm running out of ink.
You got a pen?

38:26.804 --> 38:28.169
Mopey, I'm talking to you here.

38:28.339 --> 38:31.035
You been sitting out here staring
into space for two hours.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.972
- It's been five minutes.
- Really? That was five minutes?

38:34.145 --> 38:37.137
Guess I really do suck in bed.

38:37.682 --> 38:40.344
Get it? Like I think I'm Sting,
and in all reality...

38:40.518 --> 38:43.954
...I'm like Chad Michael Murray
douching it out in five minutes.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.486
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.453
- Come on, tell me.
- It's nothing.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.751
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

38:48.926 --> 38:52.123
Tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me...

38:52.296 --> 38:53.627
- Nick.
- Sorry.

38:54.365 --> 38:56.629
- Tell me?
- Carly's boyfriend's a real schwanz.

38:56.801 --> 38:59.361
Dude, you like her. I knew it.
I knew you liked her.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.232
- So? It's no big deal.
- No big deal?

39:01.405 --> 39:03.669
She's on our squad.
You're gonna ruin everything.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.504
Why you gotta do this, huh? Why you
gotta take a leak all over my dreams?

39:07.678 --> 39:09.771
Why you lay a hot toddy
all over my hopes?

39:09.947 --> 39:12.472
- You're being a little dramatic.
- Well, I have never.

39:12.683 --> 39:15.083
What makes this girl so great, bro?

39:15.252 --> 39:18.312
Yeah. What makes this girl
so great, bro?

39:18.489 --> 39:20.081
There's just something about her.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.725
You know when she bumped into me
on the bus?

39:22.893 --> 39:27.762
Or when I saw her reading that book.
That she orders pudding for dessert.

39:27.932 --> 39:30.765
Okay, now you're just listing things
that people do.

39:30.935 --> 39:32.562
No, I'm not.

39:32.737 --> 39:36.036
- Sometimes she writes with a pencil.
- So much worse than I thought.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.804
You're really into this girl.

39:37.975 --> 39:39.306
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.502
Why is she with that knob-rocket?

39:41.679 --> 39:44.546
Enough already. You're even
depressing me, and I'm a Virgo.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.876
We have got to cheer you up.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.478
I'm two steps ahead of you, my man.

39:49.653 --> 39:51.883
All right, gentlemen, saddle up.

39:53.524 --> 39:55.651
Listen, ladies,
I couldn't help but notice...

39:55.826 --> 39:58.124
...you were practicing your lifts
on dry ground.

39:58.295 --> 40:00.024
Well, where else
would we practice?

40:00.264 --> 40:05.167
The pond. That's where the top teams
do. Water resistance, better training.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.270
Why do you think octopuses
have skinny arms?

40:07.438 --> 40:08.996
That sounds like a good idea.

40:09.206 --> 40:12.039
We can't. Our swimsuits are
all the way back at the bunks.

40:13.010 --> 40:16.241
We could just go in our underwear.
I mean, that's all swimsuits are.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.212
It's gonna be dark soon anyway,
so no one would see us.

40:19.383 --> 40:23.114
I never thought about it like that,
but I guess you're right.

40:23.287 --> 40:25.812
Look at that. We're all here
thinking inside the box...

40:25.990 --> 40:28.254
...and you're outside
playing a game of "What If?"

40:28.426 --> 40:31.793
Gorgeous and brilliant.
The triple threat.

40:32.496 --> 40:34.964
And we're off. Gentlemen, ladies.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.567
Adam, you've done enough
working out. Let's go.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.139
Oh, there it is.

40:48.479 --> 40:49.810
I am so excited.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.778
I have not been skinny dipping
since Indian Scouts.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.676
Nobody look.

40:56.587 --> 40:58.214
Windmill.

40:58.389 --> 41:01.290
We're leaving our underwear on.
We talked about this, remember?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.086
You talked. I listened.

41:04.261 --> 41:08.664
Paint the fence. Cutting the cake.
Hangman's noose. Hangman's noose.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.425
Incoming.

41:20.144 --> 41:25.207
Misjudged the depth.
It's all good. Learn from me.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.114
This feels great.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.412
It's the water resistance.
It helps strengthen.

42:03.587 --> 42:05.680
It's twice the compound,
half the measure...

42:05.856 --> 42:09.690
- ... and if you equivalate that to-
- Nick. Enough of that.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.021
- Enough of what?
- Drop the game.

42:12.196 --> 42:15.654
There are 300 girls at this camp
and only four straight guys.

42:15.833 --> 42:18.825
It's no mystery why you're ripping
through the place. So come on.

42:22.306 --> 42:23.796
Come on.

42:24.808 --> 42:26.241
Tick tock.

42:28.012 --> 42:30.173
Oh, all right.

42:37.187 --> 42:38.677
You're next.

42:40.591 --> 42:41.819
Ladies.

42:49.266 --> 42:51.700
- Where are our clothes?
- We left them right here.

42:51.869 --> 42:54.838
I know. That's why I'm saying,
"Where are our clothes?"

42:55.005 --> 42:58.941
I'm blazing a trail. I'm blazing a trail.

42:59.109 --> 43:00.508
See you guys.

43:00.678 --> 43:02.873
- Okay, have a great Thanksgiving.
- What?

43:03.047 --> 43:04.105
I don't know, I'm cold.

43:07.618 --> 43:09.916
- I'm cold and I'm flailing.
- I know, I know.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.418
How are you not flailing?

43:11.589 --> 43:13.784
I'm flailing. I too am also flailing.

43:14.024 --> 43:17.084
- So how was she?
- How was who?

43:17.261 --> 43:19.889
- The blond you were making time with.
- I wasn't.

43:20.064 --> 43:23.261
We just talked. She's really nice.
Her grandmother's from Cincinnati.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.593
She helped me on
my crossover basket launches.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.862
I can't believe how high
my extensions are.

43:28.038 --> 43:30.006
I don't know who you are anymore.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.732
Boys.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.071
What are you doing?
It's way past curfew.

43:35.245 --> 43:36.371
We were just...

43:38.415 --> 43:40.178
Practicing.

43:41.218 --> 43:42.583
- Yeah.
- Al dente?

43:42.953 --> 43:46.411
Yeah. We like to do cheers in the nude
so that they really sink in.

43:46.590 --> 43:49.423
That way our bodies learn it
as well as our minds.

43:50.327 --> 43:52.989
That's very Alvin Ailey of you.
I like it.

43:53.163 --> 43:55.927
- Proceed.
- Proceed with what, running away?

43:56.100 --> 43:57.931
No, with the cheer, you goose.

43:58.102 --> 44:01.435
Don't you wanna wait for
another coach? Or a witness?

44:01.605 --> 44:02.765
Five, six, seven, eight.

44:02.973 --> 44:04.167
- Ready?
- Okay.

44:04.341 --> 44:05.638
<i>Hey, Tigers!</i>

44:05.809 --> 44:07.140
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!</i>

44:07.311 --> 44:11.008
<i>Yeah? What do we like to eat?
Panther meat</i>

44:11.181 --> 44:12.739
<i>I said, hey, Tigers!</i>

44:12.916 --> 44:14.406
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!</i>

44:14.585 --> 44:18.043
<i>Yeah? What do we like to do?
Defeat</i>

44:18.555 --> 44:20.682
- Dude, your crankshaft.
- Two.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.653
<i>Orange, black and white unite</i>

44:23.827 --> 44:26.318
<i>Tigers, Tigers, fight, fight, fight!</i>

44:26.497 --> 44:28.192
Tailpipe.

44:30.234 --> 44:32.327
Your counts are off,
your spacing is insane...

44:32.503 --> 44:35.165
...and your moves sloppier
than a kiss from a midshipman.

44:35.372 --> 44:38.205
- What?
- Take it from the top. Positions.

44:38.709 --> 44:40.040
Parallel positions!

44:40.210 --> 44:42.041
Five, six, seven, eight.

44:42.246 --> 44:45.443
<i>Go bananas
Go, go bananas</i>

44:45.616 --> 44:49.313
<i>Go bananas
Go, go bananas</i>

44:52.156 --> 44:54.124
You can put me down now.

44:54.324 --> 44:55.689
Oh, can I?

44:56.593 --> 44:57.855
You jerk.

44:58.562 --> 44:59.586
Jack-knocker.

44:59.763 --> 45:01.390
Oh, look.

45:01.565 --> 45:04.295
- What are they doing?
- It's the Fountain of Troy.

45:04.468 --> 45:06.459
I thought that move
was prohibidimabido.

45:09.339 --> 45:11.239
- My face!
- It's okay, it's okay.

45:11.408 --> 45:13.535
What'd I tell you about
that Fountain of Troy?

45:13.711 --> 45:15.338
Look, you broke her face.

45:15.512 --> 45:18.777
Where am I gonna get another one
of those this late in the day?

45:18.949 --> 45:20.849
Someone call a doctor!

45:21.018 --> 45:22.349
Damn, I wish Rick were here.

45:22.519 --> 45:25.420
Why, so he could ask someone
to call a doctor?

45:26.924 --> 45:29.017
Ever been to
a cheerleading competition?

45:29.193 --> 45:31.127
Oh, you mean like a football game?

45:31.295 --> 45:34.264
No, not a game.
Those are like practices for us.

45:34.431 --> 45:36.422
I'm talking about a tournament.

45:36.600 --> 45:40.468
ESPN cameras all around. Hundreds
of people in crowds cheering.

45:40.637 --> 45:43.435
Wait.
People cheering cheerleaders?

45:46.009 --> 45:48.068
You should be in the movies.

45:48.278 --> 45:51.543
You're hotter than all of these
cheerleaders rolled together.

45:52.349 --> 45:54.874
Cheerleaders rolled together.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.786
I gotta take a Louis Leakey.

45:58.956 --> 46:02.892
Listen, you, don't get any cuter
while I'm gone. I'm serious.

46:03.060 --> 46:06.291
And let me give you a little tip
from a cheerleader.

46:06.463 --> 46:09.955
<i>Be aggressive
B- E aggressive</i>

46:11.835 --> 46:15.032
Where's that Jesse Bradford boy?
I love him. No, seriously.

46:15.205 --> 46:16.934
Seriously. I love him.

46:20.310 --> 46:21.777
I gotta be honest with you, man.

46:21.945 --> 46:24.277
I don't think I'm into
all this hooking up anymore.

46:24.448 --> 46:27.110
- It feels wrong.
- Yeah, it's supposed to feel wrong.

46:27.284 --> 46:28.876
No, I mean, I feel guilty.

46:29.086 --> 46:31.850
I don't know what you're saying.
Milty? Wilty?

46:32.022 --> 46:33.216
Something's not right.

46:33.390 --> 46:36.188
- Tilty?
- I've never felt this way before.

46:37.027 --> 46:38.051
Maquilty?

46:43.000 --> 46:44.661
Is that Dr. Rick?

46:48.038 --> 46:49.835
Awesome song.

46:50.641 --> 46:54.702
Dude, these local chicks are so easy.
It's like banging fish in a barrel.

46:54.878 --> 46:58.609
That Gina was a freak. I've got
bite marks all over my badonkadonk.

46:58.982 --> 47:01.542
Or was that Aubrey?
Whichever one smells like lavender.

47:01.718 --> 47:03.083
I got that stuff all over me.

47:03.253 --> 47:05.778
One of you smell my rod,
will you?

47:05.956 --> 47:07.548
Jesus. This guy's a dick.

47:07.724 --> 47:10.352
I don't get why you came here.
You don't even like Carly.

47:10.527 --> 47:12.927
I told you, man.
Our parents are old friends...

47:13.096 --> 47:16.463
...which means they approve of her,
they give me anything I want...

47:16.633 --> 47:19.693
...including this sick
3- series Beemer, with nav...

47:19.870 --> 47:21.804
...that drove your fat ass up here.

47:21.972 --> 47:23.303
Rock it.

47:23.874 --> 47:25.705
Why you gotta take a shot
at my weight?

47:25.876 --> 47:27.207
You know I'm working on it.

47:27.411 --> 47:28.469
He's just using her.

47:28.679 --> 47:32.376
And he likes to get bit in
the badonkadonk, that sick bastard.

47:32.549 --> 47:33.573
I gotta tell her.

47:33.750 --> 47:36.981
- Yeah, no, buddy. Don't tell her.
- No, I have to.

47:37.187 --> 47:38.484
No, no, you really don't.

47:38.655 --> 47:39.781
Yeah, I kind of do.

47:39.957 --> 47:43.950
It's pretty obvious that you're gonna
go against everything I stand for...

47:44.127 --> 47:48.757
...and poop where you eat, so at least
let me help you take that poop, okay?

47:48.932 --> 47:50.900
Trust me, bro, don't tell her.

47:51.068 --> 47:53.764
Why? She needs to find out
what kind of guy he really is.

47:53.937 --> 47:57.839
If you tell her, you'll be the guy who
told her her boyfriend is cheating.

47:58.008 --> 48:01.239
- Yeah?
- Bro, that's all you're ever gonna be.

48:01.411 --> 48:03.845
Best-case scenario,
she looks at you as a girlfriend.

48:04.014 --> 48:07.506
Worst-case scenario, she's pissed
at you for poking in her business.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.845
Either way, you're not poking
in her business.

48:10.921 --> 48:11.979
You marinate with that.

48:15.659 --> 48:18.059
- I hear you. That's good advice.
- It is good advice.

48:18.228 --> 48:20.093
- Thanks.
- That's what friends are for.

48:20.264 --> 48:21.424
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

48:21.632 --> 48:22.656
Carly!

48:23.433 --> 48:26.300
Hey, Carly. There's something
I have to tell you. Carly!

48:27.337 --> 48:29.237
I was wondering where you were.

48:29.406 --> 48:32.569
I was looking for you too.
But you go first. What's up?

48:32.743 --> 48:35.371
I was just wondering
about the moon.

48:35.545 --> 48:39.606
I mean, is it still crescent
or a half-moon?

48:39.783 --> 48:41.478
What the French
have to say about it?

48:43.120 --> 48:44.144
I'm an idiot.

48:44.321 --> 48:48.587
No. No, it's a waxing crescent moon
tonight, and you're not an idiot.

48:48.759 --> 48:51.159
Unless you don't know
what "waxing" means.

48:51.328 --> 48:54.263
I'm a cheerleader,
I know what "waxing" means.

48:55.465 --> 48:57.729
- Carly horse.
- Rick.

48:57.901 --> 49:00.893
- That's what he calls you?
- Yeah. He means it cute.

49:03.473 --> 49:06.670
- What's up, high school?
- You smell like lavender.

49:07.177 --> 49:08.735
Yeah.

49:08.912 --> 49:11.472
We're learning about the effects
of lavender therapy...

49:11.682 --> 49:13.411
...on type-two carcinoma patients.

49:13.583 --> 49:18.486
How's that working out? Anyone go
into remission after smelling a flower?

49:20.991 --> 49:22.822
All right, you caught me, man.

49:24.594 --> 49:28.826
- I picked you some flowers, Carly.
- That is so sweet. Where are they?

49:29.700 --> 49:32.362
I made a special wish on them
and threw them into the sky.

49:32.769 --> 49:33.861
That is so romantic.

49:34.037 --> 49:37.734
We should hit it, Carlito's Way. I told
the guys I'd be done with dinner in 40.

49:38.375 --> 49:39.899
I'll see you at practice?

49:40.077 --> 49:42.477
Shawn here is a great
leather-basket tosser.

49:43.847 --> 49:45.610
What a great trick.

49:45.782 --> 49:47.249
Not as good as yours.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.213
I'll see you tomorrow, Shawn.

50:05.702 --> 50:08.364
- Awesome date.
- I'll see you at the competition?

50:08.538 --> 50:10.199
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

50:17.714 --> 50:18.738
Bye.

50:22.085 --> 50:25.816
I like you a lot, Carles Barkley.
You're one of the good ones, babe.

50:45.909 --> 50:48.104
You know what reminds me
of the better times?

50:48.278 --> 50:52.339
Before Carly started hanging out
with those two little suck-buckets.

50:52.549 --> 50:54.039
Something's up with them.

50:54.217 --> 50:56.276
Wanna stay and do some digging?

50:56.453 --> 50:58.683
Big-time. You know why?

51:04.694 --> 51:09.495
Awesome song. Chumbawamba.
It's the soundtrack to my life, man.

51:15.639 --> 51:18.540
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.335
<i>Go, Tigers!</i>

51:20.544 --> 51:23.377
Cradle. One, two.

51:26.750 --> 51:29.048
Great job, guys.
Let's take a little water break.

51:29.219 --> 51:31.687
Are my hips rotating too late
before the final toss?

51:31.855 --> 51:35.018
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but you gotta rotate and then catch.

51:35.192 --> 51:36.955
Rotate, then catch.

51:37.127 --> 51:39.925
- We're out of water.
- We need two volunteers to refill.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.257
- I'll go.
- Me too.

51:42.899 --> 51:44.958
Dude, don't go. Hey, Shawn.

51:45.735 --> 51:46.759
God-

51:46.937 --> 51:49.337
That was really good.
Keep it up, okay?

51:50.107 --> 51:51.574
Hi.

51:53.310 --> 51:55.744
Listen, I don't know
if I've told you this yet...

51:55.912 --> 51:59.245
...but your coaching, I mean,
it's been incredible.

51:59.449 --> 52:03.545
And whatever happens between us,
you've made me a better cheerleader.

52:03.753 --> 52:06.654
- And for that, I owe you-
- You have some food in your teeth.

52:07.624 --> 52:11.082
And your pecs are uneven.
Make sure you don't favor one side.

52:11.661 --> 52:12.855
Always coaching.

52:14.064 --> 52:15.463
God bless you!

52:17.300 --> 52:18.927
Why can't I crack this?

52:19.102 --> 52:20.160
Damn it.

52:20.570 --> 52:21.867
So...

52:22.072 --> 52:26.008
...how often did you see Dr. Rick
during the school year?

52:26.176 --> 52:29.634
I don't know why he keeps calling
himself that. It's kind of douchey.

52:29.813 --> 52:32.145
Oh, no, no, no. It's super cool.

52:33.016 --> 52:35.143
I can't believe he's my pre-fiancé.

52:35.318 --> 52:37.445
I remember when I was 7,
I decided...

52:37.621 --> 52:40.647
...that I was not gonna get married
until I was 34.

52:40.824 --> 52:44.988
- That's very specific.
- Oh, I had it all thought out.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.528
High school, college,
a year abroad in Greece...

52:47.697 --> 52:50.723
...and because, don't laugh,
I always loved Greek salad.

52:50.901 --> 52:54.837
Tomatoes, cucumbers, feta.
No, that makes perfect sense.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.233
I know. It's silly.

52:56.406 --> 52:58.237
I love that you had it
all planned out.

52:58.408 --> 53:01.707
- You know what John Lennon said.
- Not really. I'm not in my 50s.

53:01.878 --> 53:02.970
I could ask my dad.

53:03.146 --> 53:05.842
"Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

53:06.216 --> 53:07.581
Yeah.

53:15.892 --> 53:17.723
Damn, this is heavy.

53:17.894 --> 53:20.226
Are you okay? You look hot.
Do you want some water?

53:20.397 --> 53:21.864
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.
- Here.

53:25.902 --> 53:28.769
Did you say I looked hot?
I'm pretty sure that's what I heard.

53:28.939 --> 53:31.635
- I heard you screaming like a girl.
- Oh, really?

53:31.808 --> 53:34.003
Oh, my God. Don't move.
There's a bee on you.

53:34.177 --> 53:36.941
What? No. Get it off.

53:38.515 --> 53:39.948
You little bitch!

53:42.786 --> 53:45.084
All right, week three of cheer camp,
here we come.

53:45.255 --> 53:47.246
I love the smell of pom-pom
in the morning.

53:47.424 --> 53:48.891
Let's do this.

53:49.926 --> 53:52.156
- Where you going?
- Post-breakfast practice.

53:52.329 --> 53:55.787
And then, you know, Carly and I are
gonna work on reverse cartwheels.

53:55.966 --> 53:59.629
My left foot keeps hitching when
I do my inverse swing-over. It's like:

53:59.803 --> 54:02.203
Take it easy.
We're done with this, all right?

54:02.405 --> 54:03.929
Week three. Hit it and quit it.

54:04.107 --> 54:06.803
Oh, no, we gotta-
We gotta stay longer.

54:06.977 --> 54:09.707
Dude, it's time to go.
Remember Mookie's dad's house?

54:09.879 --> 54:11.278
The plasmas and the Jacuzzis.

54:11.448 --> 54:14.542
Yeah, but I just- I think
we should stay just a touch longer.

54:14.718 --> 54:16.686
I'm done. All right?
I've had enough girl.

54:16.853 --> 54:19.549
Breadsticks only keep you
at the Olive Garden for so long.

54:19.723 --> 54:21.054
Till, at some point, you say:

54:21.258 --> 54:23.556
"Why am I at Olive Garden
with these fat people?"

54:23.727 --> 54:25.354
- What? No...
- Let's go.

54:25.528 --> 54:28.258
- Let's talk about this.
- All right, let's go. Let's pack.

54:28.465 --> 54:30.160
Let's just dialogue for a second.

54:30.333 --> 54:32.767
- We don't have to go right now.
- Yeah, we do.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.598
The bus leaves in an hour.
Next one's not until tomorrow.

54:35.772 --> 54:38.263
Yeah, but come on, man.
What about our squad?

54:38.441 --> 54:40.238
You know,
the competition's coming up.

54:40.410 --> 54:43.140
Dude, the squad? The competition?
Listen to yourself.

54:43.313 --> 54:45.577
We had a deal. Two weeks. Right?

54:45.749 --> 54:48.183
Kiss, kiss, bang, bang,
sayonara, cheer camp.

54:48.351 --> 54:50.342
<i>We are leaving
We, we are leaving</i>

54:50.520 --> 54:51.578
<i>We are leaving</i>

54:51.921 --> 54:53.513
Now, come on, dude, start packing.

54:53.690 --> 54:56.682
I need a little bit more time with Carly.
There. I said it. Okay?

54:56.860 --> 54:59.522
I know you think that's lame,
but can you give me one day?

54:59.696 --> 55:02.164
That's not lame, bro. That's gay.

55:02.332 --> 55:05.824
Well, technically, pursuing a woman
you have heterosexual feelings for...

55:06.036 --> 55:07.503
...that's not gay, Nick.

55:07.671 --> 55:10.799
But using a rotating inverse
swing-over to do it? Yeah, that is.

55:10.974 --> 55:14.774
Shawn. Don't forget we're gonna
go over our reverse cartwheels.

55:14.944 --> 55:17.378
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- See you there.

55:17.547 --> 55:19.105
All right. Right behind him.

55:19.282 --> 55:22.274
All right, come on, man, let's go.
You know the deal.

55:22.786 --> 55:25.118
And trust me,
you're gonna thank me for this.

55:26.156 --> 55:28.989
All right, let's go, Shawnzy.
And no more moping. All right?

55:29.159 --> 55:31.719
Not an attractive color on you,
nor is orange and gray.

55:31.895 --> 55:33.556
Takes away from your eyes.

55:42.005 --> 55:45.532
Damn it, damn it, damn it...

55:51.348 --> 55:52.406
What are you doing?

55:52.582 --> 55:55.016
Well, probably making
the biggest mistake of my life.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.312
Except that year
I wore that leather wristband.

55:57.487 --> 56:00.854
How did I possibly think that's cool,
you know? I'm not a blacksmith.

56:01.024 --> 56:02.651
That was a little Nickelback-y.

56:02.826 --> 56:05.158
You like this girl,
you're my boy, we stay.

56:05.328 --> 56:07.057
Well, what about Mookie's house?

56:07.230 --> 56:08.822
Are you coming or not?

56:09.899 --> 56:12.390
Are you sure we are staying?
We, we are staying?

56:12.569 --> 56:15.265
No, I'm not sure,
so don't turn a yes into a no.

56:15.438 --> 56:17.497
Thank you, Nick.
Thank you so much, man.

56:17.674 --> 56:19.665
I know you don't like
man-to-man touching...

56:19.843 --> 56:23.370
...but my arm is on your shoulder.
Here comes my arm right now.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.514
<i>- Another day
- Another holler</i>

56:25.682 --> 56:29.914
You're wasting my precious breath.
I can't hear you.

56:30.086 --> 56:32.179
<i>- Another day
- Another holler</i>

56:32.355 --> 56:34.323
<i>- Another day
- Another holler</i>

56:34.491 --> 56:35.515
<i>Another day</i>

56:36.493 --> 56:38.085
Hey, bro, got a second?

56:39.329 --> 56:40.762
Wrong section of the woods.

56:40.964 --> 56:43.455
You want the northeast corner
near the redwoods.

56:43.767 --> 56:47.168
What? I wanna know if you know
two dudes named Nick and Shawn.

56:47.837 --> 56:50.567
Yeah. They're my bunkmates. Why?

56:51.941 --> 56:56.808
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

56:58.715 --> 57:00.239
- Angela, no.
- Are you okay?

57:00.417 --> 57:03.113
Easy, Tiger. Easy, Tiger.

57:04.721 --> 57:08.418
- I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You all right?

57:08.591 --> 57:09.717
I'm okay.

57:11.628 --> 57:13.789
Sorry, guys, I just suck.

57:13.963 --> 57:17.558
- It's not just you. We all kind of suck.
- We're not good at all.

57:18.168 --> 57:21.399
- Hey, stop. Stop talking like that.
- But it's true.

57:21.571 --> 57:23.163
We're just not that good.

57:24.007 --> 57:25.133
Stop.

57:25.308 --> 57:28.402
Enough of that.
You can go as far as you want.

57:29.245 --> 57:31.338
What do the Panthers have
that you don't have?

57:31.514 --> 57:32.708
- Skills.
- Athleticism.

57:32.882 --> 57:34.406
- Kickass cheers.
- Hair removal.

57:34.584 --> 57:37.075
Big-ass titties. I'm just saying.

57:37.253 --> 57:40.086
Confidence.
They're cocky assholes.

57:40.256 --> 57:43.748
Like Nick, the cockiest asshole on the
football field. That's why he's good.

57:43.927 --> 57:46.157
- I'm awesome.
- Because he believes in himself.

57:46.329 --> 57:47.489
Also because I'm awesome.

57:47.664 --> 57:50.792
He knows he's gonna be good,
so he's good. And he takes chances.

57:50.967 --> 57:52.662
Due to the fact that I'm awesome.

57:52.836 --> 57:55.669
- Nick. Trying to make a speech here.
- I'm sorry.

57:55.839 --> 57:58.467
Either bet big or go home.

57:58.775 --> 58:02.040
If you don't wanna take any chances,
then you shouldn't even be here.

58:02.278 --> 58:05.679
I know you wanna be here, because
you finish last every single year...

58:05.849 --> 58:07.476
...but you keep coming back...

58:07.650 --> 58:09.811
...even if it means
taking endless shit...

58:09.986 --> 58:12.511
...from total dong-knockers
like the Panthers.

58:12.722 --> 58:14.280
I wanna cut the blond one.

58:14.457 --> 58:15.685
- What?
- What?

58:15.859 --> 58:17.451
- What?
- What?

58:17.627 --> 58:20.391
- What?
- I'm just saying.

58:21.164 --> 58:23.462
Come on, guys.
Let's be cocky assholes.

58:23.633 --> 58:25.032
He's right.

58:25.201 --> 58:26.225
And I can say that...

58:26.402 --> 58:30.065
...because I am the best cheerleader
here, so you can all suck my dick.

58:32.876 --> 58:34.605
I was just being a cocky asshole.

58:34.777 --> 58:38.372
Oh, nice. Did you see
what she was doing there?

58:38.548 --> 58:41.016
That's exactly what I want
from everybody.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.811
All right, let's do this.

58:42.986 --> 58:46.444
And remember, you're awesome.
Let's risk it to get the biscuit.

58:46.623 --> 58:48.056
All right, get cocky, bitches.

58:51.394 --> 58:53.555
Let's do it. Come on, guys. Ready.

58:53.763 --> 58:54.991
<i>Hit it!</i>

58:55.164 --> 58:57.394
<i>All you chumps
Think you got poise</i>

58:57.567 --> 58:59.694
<i>You prance around like little toys</i>

58:59.869 --> 59:02.133
<i>Do you really think
You can make some noise?</i>

59:02.305 --> 59:04.170
Five, six, seven, eight.

59:04.340 --> 59:05.671
<i>Tigers!</i>

59:05.842 --> 59:07.571
- Get cocky.
- Get cocky.

59:08.311 --> 59:10.279
Come on, everybody.

59:12.849 --> 59:14.373
<i>Let's go, tigres.</i>

59:15.718 --> 59:17.208
There it is.

59:20.056 --> 59:21.080
All right, get cocky.

59:21.257 --> 59:22.485
Here we go, here we go.

59:22.659 --> 59:23.785
Keep it tight.

59:38.441 --> 59:39.772
Everybody, let's work.

59:49.018 --> 59:53.580
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

59:53.756 --> 59:54.882
There it is.

59:55.058 --> 59:56.525
Go big, Shawnzy.

59:57.360 --> 59:58.691
I'm doing it, brother.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.400
Awesome. So much better.

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:15.267
<i>Tigers!</i>

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:19.645
<i>All right, la tigres. Come on.</i>

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:22.044
That's my girls,
bringing some A-game.

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:24.276
You are some cocky bitches.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.787
I think it's safe to say that you guys
are now officially Tigers.

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.891
- Right, girls?
- All right.

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.492
One, two, three.

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:33.026
Tigers!

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:36.054
One, two, three, frauds!

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.991
- Rick?
- These two have been playing you.

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:41.398
They didn't come
because they like cheerleading.

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.766
They came here because
they like cheerleaders.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.238
- Yeah, we know.
- Everyone knows.

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.274
Why are you here?
What's going on, Rick?

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:51.311
- Bus tickets.
- Damn it.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.507
Your friends were planning on leaving
before the competition...

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.778
...without any feeling for anyone
they may have left in their wake.

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.421
- Animals.
- You were gonna leave?

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:02.922
Well, we were gonna, but we didn't.
That's way before you and I ever-

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:05.754
- You were gonna do this to the squad?
- I can explain.

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:09.659
I can't believe you. I mean,
I knew you were here to get girls, but...

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:12.130
- ... I thought you started to get into it.
- I did.

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:15.498
It started off being about girls,
but then it became about you.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.505
- Wait, that doesn't sound right.
- That sounds exactly right.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.199
Bail, brother. Bail.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.037
I really like you, Carly.

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:23.610
That's close enough, dicklick.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.739
This is how you show someone you
like them, Shawn? By lying to them?

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:30.750
To be fair, he lied to you
before he really cared...

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.378
...then he tried super hard to word it
so it wouldn't be a lie after that.

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.149
Just so we're on the same page.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:40.119
If these weren't tools for healing,
I would crack you in the jaw.

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:42.196
- You're a tool for healing.
- That's right.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.299
You're the guy
who's fancy with his words.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:47.061
Well, then, why don't
I just read your diary?

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:50.103
- Where did you get that?
- I've done a bad thing. I'm so sorry.

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:53.208
I'm sorry. I'm a sorry Suzy
right now. He tricked me.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.866
You tricked me.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.443
This is how it happened.

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:58.270
Brewster!

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.440
He said he wanted to leave you a note,
I brought him to the bunk.

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:03.448
He must've seen
your stuff on the couch.

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:06.213
- Why was it on the couch?
- I was cleaning up your mess.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.516
I told you I can't stand clutter.
I warned you.

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:12.149
- Give me the book back.
- "Cheer camp, day one.

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:16.259
The sun rises in the summer sky...

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:19.560
...like Rembrandt's brush
on a dogwood branch. "

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.803
- Queeratron.
- Let's go. Give it to me.

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:26.164
Back up, Abercrombie & Bitch.

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.774
"And thereby Diora-"

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:38.510
"I lie awake thinking, will I ever say
'Diora,' as a whisper in an ear?

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.452
Will she ever say "I love you,"
in a moment with a tear?"

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:44.286
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.527
Carly, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:52.327
Just leave, okay? Just leave
like you always planned on doing.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:55.369
Carly, please, let me explain.
Give me just one second.

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:57.369
See you later, high school.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.373
I didn't write that. I bought the book.
It was in there.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:01.874
It was beautiful.

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:03.940
Thanks.

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:09.317
Never really thought of that one.

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:12.977
Using one's true feelings
to wrangle snooch.

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.513
So simple.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:33.074
So we lied and we got caught.
So what, huh?

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.971
We're humans. Humans lie.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.580
They tell big gigantic two-week-long
lies because they're humans.

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:41.478
Stop saying "humans. " We did this.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.278
Because we're humans.

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:46.387
All right, humans are
the only species that can lie.

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:49.187
Except for maybe chameleons.

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:52.326
And possums. They play dead.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:56.925
What's that?

01:03:57.099 --> 01:04:00.227
It's Downey's bracelet.
Yeah, I love that kid, huh?

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.769
Said it was cool, so he gave it to me.
How nice.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.999
Those are his... beads, bro.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.439
Downey liked you.
Like, "liked you" liked you.

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:11.239
What? That's crazy.
Downey isn't gay.

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:14.349
Nick, come on. Think about it.

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.647
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:19.788
- What's up? I'm Downey.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:23.551
Put it in there.
A little cheer camp. Crazy good times.

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:25.057
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.662
<i>Panther meat!
I said, hey, Tigers!</i>

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.923
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!</i>

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.226
Diora.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.369
Hey, Nick.
You wanna go out on the field...

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.562
...and maybe count shooting stars
with me?

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:39.071
You're classic, Downey. Classic.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:47.944
Raw-hamburger fight!

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.896
I'm hit.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:08.801
Medic!
This man needs some jocks-ygen.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.530
Come on, we're losing him.

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:16.201
Don't you die on me. Don't die on me.
Don't you die on me.

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:18.878
<i>You prance around like little toys</i>

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:21.414
<i>Do you really think
You can make some noise?</i>

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.415
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.486
<i>Tigers!</i>

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:32.821
Welcome back to Sucktown.
Population: you.

01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:37.227
Without your gigolos, looks like
you got last place sewn up, again.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.597
Why don't you get your nose job
out of everybody else's business.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.964
I got thrown by a horse.

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.766
Why? Was he spooked because
you both have the same face?

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.670
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.070
Carly, don't.

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:52.180
You're placing your anger at the boys
on them. It's transference.

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.713
You're right.
I'm gonna punch you in the throat!

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.009
Let it go.

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:02.985
Look at that little hottie. Wonder
what she wants to do with her life.

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:04.416
What?

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:07.153
You know how Bianca
wants to go to cooking school...

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:09.694
...and Sylvia wants to be a pilot,
and...

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:10.923
Oh, my God.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:14.626
I actually know these girls,
as, like, friends.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.203
And I care.

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.272
I'm becoming
like a fully formed person...

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:20.409
...with like sensitivity and empathy.

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.435
All right, I'm a person!

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:26.706
Look at the pooper on that one.
I could rest my beer on that shit.

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:29.680
And you're back. What kind of
dressing goes on a Greek salad?

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.547
Olive oil, top shelf.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.829
Is it me, Shawnzy, or is this not nearly
as much fun as it was last year?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.023
It's not you.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.225
This is too high. Give me a boost.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.229
Shoulder stand.

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:51.873
- Ready?
- Okay.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.875
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:57.137
- Grab.
- Out, drop, catch, dismount.

01:06:58.047 --> 01:06:59.912
Catch. Yeah, buddy.

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:01.481
Guys?

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.808
Don't take this the wrong way...

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:06.420
...but I think there's someone
you should talk to.

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.851
Hello, I'm am Reginald
von Belly Button.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.392
I love Twinkies.

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:26.173
The competition's tomorrow.
I wonder if we could win it.

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.906
Did you say
"I wonder if we could win"?

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.409
- No.
- Yes, you did.

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.342
- You totally did.
- Didn't.

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.778
You wanna go back.
You're into cheering.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:38.647
I'm the captain of the football team.
I could give a rat's ass about cheering.

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:41.255
- You're a cheerleader.
- You're misquoting me.

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:42.482
Do you wanna go back?

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:45.718
For you. Because I can't stand
seeing my best friend in Frown Town.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.089
That's how selfless I am.

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:50.027
I would sacrifice myself
to cheer you up. I'm like Gandhi.

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:52.599
- Gandhi?
- Gandhi!

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:55.931
- Mahatma K. Gandhi.
- Quake'n Bake!

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.602
Bus leaves in 20 minutes.

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:05.644
If we extend our high V's, we have
a chance at landing that aerial.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:08.045
I don't know who you are anymore.

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:10.515
Kenny's asleep on the couch.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:13.154
We're gonna get whipped cream
and paint his face.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.051
- Come on.
- Be right there, dudes.

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.783
- Right behind you, bro.
- Oh, my horse is peeing.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.970
What is that?

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.341
Go back to sleep.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.684
Why are you in my bed?

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:48.082
I must have sleepwalked.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:50.850
I'm here now.
Let's just make the best of it.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.627
Get out of my bed, Bianca.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:57.027
- I kind of can't.
- Why?

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:59.133
I might not have pants on.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.828
- What are you doing here?
- I came back.

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:07.237
- I can see that. Goodbye.
- Carly, just listen to me.

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:08.808
- Why?
- We're teammates.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.377
Teammates don't join a team
under false pretenses...

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:13.537
...then leave once they
get what they want.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.514
I know you're pissed at me,
and you should be. I lied to you.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:20.781
But this is about the squad. We all
worked way too hard to throw it away.

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.787
How are you standing in the air?

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:25.221
Just take us back already. Christ!

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:26.986
Nick. Carly...

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.256
...I like you,
but that's not why I'm here.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.796
Oh, rock me, sexy Jesus.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.433
- Why are you here?
- Honestly?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.593
- No. Lie to me again.
- Shawnzy, make it quick, buddy.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.466
- Buddy.
- I like cheering.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:41.468
Fraggle Rock.

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:42.736
I'm sorry, man.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.203
My pecs are sore.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:48.077
Oh, my God, Diora's right.
My left side is weaker.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.514
- I favor one side.
- Pull me up. Pull me up.

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:53.154
Is this your plan
to get a little face time with me?

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:55.984
No. I'm dying here, seriously.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:10:00.351
- Carly, come on. We need them.
- I don't wanna come in last again.

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.764
Fine. But I'm only doing this
for the squad.

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.333
You got it.

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.236
- Bianca?
- Yeah.

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:14.899
Any chance you could throw on
a pair of underpants?

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:19.509
It's competition day today.
Competition.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.050
- Wow, this is big-time.
- Yeah, it is.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:32.319
Well, well, well, if it isn't a couple
of wolves in cheer clothing.

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:35.622
Which part of "next time I see
your punim they'll be on the moon"...

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:38.790
- ... didn't you understand?
- Like, the whole thing?

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:41.630
I'm gonna have to go ahead
and ask you both to go ahead...

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:44.136
...and leave right now to leave now.

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:46.331
It's all right.
I told them they could stay.

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:49.500
You really want these strong-jawed
philanderers on your squad?

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:50.702
Yeah.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.871
It was just a little misunderstanding
we had before.

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.141
All right. Your choice.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:59.117
Next time you screw up,
I'm gonna have both your asses.

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:00.612
That's frightening.

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.814
Let's move it along.
Giddyup and roar.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:05.324
Let me see those claws.
Move it along.

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:10.431
Meet me on Taryn Field tonight
after the competition. Bring your diary.

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:12.801
Only if you bring the dance
in your step...

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:16.165
...like a shimmering nymph
traveling the back of the wind.

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:22.400
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Channel 29's coverage...

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:25.809
...of the Regional Southeastern
Illinois Cheerleading Competition.

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:57.268
Bend at the hips and reach through
your hands. Don't lock-

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:01.177
God, please give us the strength to
land our flip-flops and basket tosses.

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.181
Amen. Oh, and fix the economy.

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.980
- Red leather, yellow leather.
- Red leather, yellow leather.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:08.623
- Unique New York.
- Unique New York.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:11.918
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:17.999
Five, six, seven, eight.
Kill, Panthers, kill. Panthers, kill...

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:24.631
- Shawn.
- Carly.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.873
- What you did really hurt me.
- I know, I know. I know.

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:32.810
I want you to know why. It's just
I thought you and I got really close...

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.175
...and I trusted you.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.580
I know.
I felt the same way about you.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:41.717
I'm really sorry, Carly.
And I don't expect you to forgive me.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.357
I want you to know I'm sorry.

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:46.392
There's my Carly Davidson!

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.329
Hi, Rick.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:57.301
- Just came by to say break a leg.
- That's theater. This is cheering.

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.940
You better believe it.

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.770
- What's up, Dick?
- It's Rick. Dr. Rick.

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:05.772
God, I keep doing that.
You just look like such a Dick to me.

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.882
What are you crunt-sacks
doing back here?

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.917
It's okay. They're just helping us
do our final routine.

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.383
I'll be watching you.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:16.388
Yeah. That's exactly what an audience
member does at a performance event.

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:18.059
Just go sit down, Rick.

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:23.460
<i>Robert De Niro,
Meet the Parents reference. Love it.</i>

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.758
- God, he seems great.
- Really nice.

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:27.959
I like him.

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:38.739
Here you go. Look alive.

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.745
Coming at you.
Here you go. Look alive.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:43.817
Coming at you. Here you go,
freak shows. New uniforms.

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.986
- Here you go. Look alive.
- We didn't order these.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:49.283
No shit, lesbatron. My brother did.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.619
We're a new squad.
We need new uniforms.

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:54.786
- Thank you, Shawn.
- Awesome. Thank you.

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:58.057
- Okay. You owe me 127.80.
- You said it was gonna be 200.

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:00.633
- I cut you a deal.
- Wow, Poppy. Thank you.

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.634
That's actually human of you.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:04.966
Don't get all ABC Family
on me here, buddy.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.300
You're doing me a favor.

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:10.002
I guaranteed Staples 45 seconds
of airtime, so cheat out to camera.

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:12.079
And work this into your cheer:

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.738
"Staples now carries 30-percent
recycled copy paper.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:17.477
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you. "

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:18.677
- Hey.
- Okay.

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:21.288
If I don't have the money,
it's my shoe in your ass.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.426
- That seems fair.
- You look great. Are you in love?

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:28.487
Stay safe.

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.457
What's up, kid?

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.101
- Downey.
- Good to have you back.

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:37.966
Why didn't you tell me you're gay?
I'd have been totally okay with that.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.008
- Paint with all the colors of the wind.
- Wait. You're straight?

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:46.847
Am I straight? Yes.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.380
But what about your diary?

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.348
Then you asked for my beads
and stuck them in your mouth-

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.182
- I thought it was a bracelet.
- A bracelet in your mouth?

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.880
- I don't know.
- The closet door...

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:57.958
...is made of all kinds of wood,
brother.

01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.616
What?

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.130
- All kinds.
- Okay.

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:06.961
God, that is so awkward.

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:14.437
The Panthers, clear favorites,
have really come to play today.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:46.532
<i>Fierce, brave, hungry, Panthers</i>

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.766
<i>Kill!</i>

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.913
- Dude, they're kind of great.
- Yeah.

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:02.681
It's not about them, guys.

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:06.191
It's about us. Just stay focused.
We'll be fine.

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:07.385
Panthers out.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:17.371
Oh, let me get that for you.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.438
Drool much?

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.343
Panthers out.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.056
Free paper, courtesy of Staples.
30-percent recycled copy paper.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.926
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you.

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:46.998
Do you have
50-percent recycled paper?

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:50.969
No. But I have 50-percent recycled
asshole paper. It's in the men's room.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.471
It's free, gay bar, just take it.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.109
Let's do this.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.376
- Tigers!
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:57.476
- Tigers!
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:01.241
Now, the Tigers from Gerald R. Ford
High School in Hinsdale, Illinois.

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:04.842
This team historically ranks last
like their namesake president.

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.318
Let's see if they've
stepped it up this year.

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:10.287
Hey. Is this on TV?
Dude, this can't be on TV.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:13.792
Don't worry. It's NBC. No one
watches network television anymore.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:16.089
Look, it's Nick on TV, cheerleading.

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.859
Shawn too. They're cheerleaders.

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:21.628
I thought those dudes
were in the kitchen.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:25.929
<i>All you chumps think you got poise
You prance around like little toys</i>

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.405
Shit.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.372
My chickens.

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:31.341
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.071
<i>Tigers!</i>

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:58.001
Risky floor stunts, athletic tumbling,
tight formations.

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:01.370
Looks like the addition of those
two new guys is really paying off.

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:06.675
Oh, my God, that bitch.

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:12.047
- It's not totally her fault.
- I was talking about Dr. Dick.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.688
It sucks. Don't let it distract you.
We're gonna win.

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:17.188
No, we're not.
We're not as good as the others.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.691
Yeah, we are. And there's
one way we can prove it.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.765
- The Fountain of Troy.
- Yeah, right.

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:28.596
I thought that move
was prohibidimibidibabido.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.104
Remember Lennon?

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.806
"Life's what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:44.884
- This is it. Life's happening.
- It's not that easy, Shawn.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:49.046
I never said it was. You can do it.
I know you can. I'll jump it with you.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:51.624
I still just don't see them
qualifying for States.

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:54.887
They are just not in the same league
as the top teams here.

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:58.261
- Who's gonna catch me?
- Nick.

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:01.869
- Who's gonna catch you?
- Them.

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:04.562
I have total faith in them.
They're Tigers.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.038
- But what if they don't?
- Bet big or go home.

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:09.200
You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.616
- We're doing it.
- You sure?

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.253
We're doing a lot of talking.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.821
This seems like a lot
of talking during the routine.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.421
Lot of talking during the routine.

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.857
I'm the fountain.
Shawn, base. Nick, back.

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:32.556
Girls, catch. Shawn,
double-back handspring to end it.

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:33.792
- Got it.
- Ready?

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:35.266
Break.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:47.403
Is this what I think it is? Are the Tigers
trying the Fountain of Troy?

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:51.980
This is the most dangerous move
in cheerleading. OMG.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.710
That's prohibidado.

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:57.415
I told them in Spanish. How much
clearer could I have been?

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.419
Here comes the build.

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:01.753
Nice.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.293
An awesome flying pose.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.472
Here it comes, the final fountain.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:21.139
And now for the final dismount.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.114
Yes.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.946
Perfect.

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:27.681
And the final flip out.

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.622
Here it comes, and...

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.749
<i>Tigers!</i>

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:44.770
Shawn!

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.607
Tigers!

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:03.715
That little shit.

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.449
My chicken shit.

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:10.053
Shawnzy. No, come here.
Come here, buddy. God.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.060
Hey.

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:18.529
Hey.

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.673
Did we win?
Are we going to States?

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:23.470
No, we came in 19th.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.004
I'm sorry.

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.173
Are you kidding? That's 10 places
better than we did last year.

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.945
If they didn't deduct points
for the Fountain of Troy...

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.519
...we might've made top three.

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:36.023
You nailed your triple backflip.

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.886
I nailed my double backflip...

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:41.722
...because a triple backflip
would've landed me in the water.

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:45.157
Yeah, I did do three.
That makes more sense.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.277
- What was that?
- About three weeks overdue.

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.022
What the hell are you doing?

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.297
Kissing my teammate.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.698
You wanna die today? I can take life
just as fast as I can give it.

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:24.463
First of all, you're not a doctor.

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.138
Second of all,
you're not my boyfriend.

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:29.140
What? Carly Fries, come on.

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:32.602
You're dumping me for him?

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.413
No, I'm dumping you, period.

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:39.519
And then I'm gonna be with him,
period. If that's okay with him.

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.216
Question mark.

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:45.052
Totally. Exclamation point.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:48.623
Oh, puke.
Parentheses, bold, underline.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:54.735
Carly Horse. Carly's Jr., baby.
Larry, Moe and Carly.

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:58.298
Carly and the Chocolate Factory,
sugar.

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:02.533
Carlsbad, Carly-fornia.

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:05.278
Why don't you run along now?

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:07.472
The longer you watch,
the sadder it gets.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.674
- I'll show you sad.
- Hey, buddy.

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:11.079
Oh, Jesus.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.344
- Nick.
- Nick.

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:16.553
That was for the Crocs.

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:19.386
You're not an old lady gardening
or a baby on the beach.

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:22.997
Okay? Now put on some shoes,
you're embarrassing yourself.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.229
I'm just saying.

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:30.371
- You okay?
- Nothing a kiss can't fix.

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:32.165
Wait till tonight.

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:37.067
I'm gonna make a wish on these
and throw them into the sky.

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:42.709
I hope one of you ends up
in my ER one day, bleeding...

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:45.250
...I'll make you wait for days.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.353
Unless one of you has Blue Cross...

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:52.017
...that's a PPO,
none of that HMO bullshit!

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.025
This is so cute.

01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:01.930
The 19th-placers.
You're like the littlest pigs.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:07.671
- How does it feel to still suck ass?
- You tell me.

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:15.012
Please don't hurt us. I was just kidding
about the whole rivalry thing.

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:18.209
Cheering doesn't mean that much
to me. I wanna be a paralegal.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:20.354
I love your hair. Go.
That bitch is crazy.

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:24.083
Way to go, Bianca.
I didn't know you had it in you.

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:26.557
There's a lot you don't know
about her.

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:30.525
You know that John Lennon
"life happening"...

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:34.190
..."risk it to get the biscuit"
stuff you said back there?

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:35.700
It didn't really make sense.

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.565
Well, it got you to do it.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:40.367
No. You got me to do it.

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:51.910
Well, congratulations, kid.
You got what you wanted.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:54.778
Thanks to you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:57.754
- Just shut up. Shut up.
- Is it hard for you to accept thanks?

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.326
- You want me to accept thanks?
- Yeah. Open up to me.

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:03.089
Here it comes from my mouth.
And you're welcome.

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:06.463
Diora.

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.465
Lose the clothes.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.869
That's good. No.

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:17.543
- Read me something from your diary.
- What?

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:22.149
"Perchance to dream,
perchance to love a wind- Hair...

01:25:22.317 --> 01:25:25.878
- the summer skies
as teardrops cascade from my lo-"

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:31.282
Oh, my God. My husband.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.027
This is not what it looks like.

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:36.163
Looks like you're running
some naked drill.

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:37.355
Exactly.

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:39.864
- Carry on.
- With what? Kissing your wife?

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:42.434
Good one. Five, six, seven, eight.

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:45.471
<i>I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?
I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?</i>

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.198
Hold it.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:54.005
I'm gonna lay my hands on you to get
a really good sense of your movement.

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.740
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.781
<i>- I said, hey, Tigers!
- Yeah!</i>

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.977
<i>- I said, hey, Tigers!
- Yeah!</i>

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.680
<i>- What do we like to-?
- Panther meat!</i>

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:05.189
Sweet Jesus, mother of God!

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:09.561
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:12.666
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:14.802
Dude, your dad put his wang
on your shoulder.

01:26:14.969 --> 01:26:17.301
Dude, your mom gave you an HJ
and tipped you a dollar.

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:19.633
Your cousin whacked you
in the face with his wang.

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:23.208
Come on, your cousin put his wiener
on your plate. You gotta get over it.

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.642
Will you shut up, man?
I'm too straight to be gay.

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:29.840
<i>I could watch What Not to Wear
with Nathan Lane in my blouse...</i>

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:32.076
...and still win a straight award.

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:33.311
That's not right.

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:35.388
I could smoke pole
and still be straight.

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.718
- I can't say "smoke pole"?
- No.

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.254
Carly. Come here.

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:44.125
We're working on a new mount
Bianca came up with.

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:47.029
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.397
- We didn't order these.
- No shit, lesbatron.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:52.472
No shit, Indigo Girl.
No shit, Lesbos, island of Greece.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.165
No shit, queer-leader.
No shit, Dixie Chick.

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:57.834
Wait, what? Just joking. Sorry.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.946
The Fountain of Troy?

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:02.241
I thought that move
was prohibidabido.

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:05.946
It's not prohibidabido?

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.054
No, I'm pretty sure
it's prohibibabido.

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:11.182
Cut.

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.554
Go ahead and clap.

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:16.422
Mediocrity deserves applause.

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:19.726
Why don't we go find a Ford Focus
and clap around it?

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:25.138
Mascot down!

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.804
It's a dragon!

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:32.544
Tell me about that road.

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:38.182
Is it lonely on that road?

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:45.390
Have you made up your mind?

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:50.860
- You gonna waste any more time?
- No!

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:54.292
Then here we go.

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:11.208
- F-U!
- F-U!

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.490
You're damn straight. F-U!

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:59.259
I can't take this head anymore.
Oh, the air feels so good.

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.293
All right, kiss me.

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:04.824
What are you doing?

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:07.901
Keep it on, sexy beast.

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:25.379
And that's how you kiss a guy.

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:27.376
Okay.

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:29.853
All right, again.
