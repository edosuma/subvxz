WEBVTT

00:11.530 --> 00:14.865
I'm transfering the other patients
out of this wing, for your request.

00:15.150 --> 00:19.949
A reorganisation of this size, the
directors would ask questions Mr Luthor.

00:20.195 --> 00:23.345
For what I'm paying you doctor,
I'm sure you can buy some answers.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.701 --> 00:50.227
Keep him isolated.

00:51.730 --> 00:56.230
24 hours surveillance, notify me immediately
if there is any change in his condition.

01:42.551 --> 01:43.080
Hey !

01:43.737 --> 01:45.292
Sorry about that Mr Luthor.

01:46.555 --> 01:48.139
Yeah, my bad.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.248
Are you really gonna make
it friends, aren't you Lee ?

01:51.272 --> 01:53.655
Yes I'm just a people person.

01:54.090 --> 01:55.029
Hey he... he got...

02:07.888 --> 02:10.562
Can I light up room or what ?

02:11.079 --> 02:13.005
Ouh, put your hands up, hands up.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.782
Got to do your thing, go go !

02:28.032 --> 02:29.265
What's going on ?

02:29.300 --> 02:30.826
He has blown his joy.

02:45.951 --> 02:47.630
Where do you go now boss ?

02:48.205 --> 02:49.110
Smallville.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.640
"Mortal"

03:42.098 --> 03:43.613
Ok pull !

03:44.371 --> 03:45.428
Steady...

03:51.555 --> 03:53.680
Pull !

03:54.162 --> 03:54.913
Ok.

03:55.582 --> 03:56.416
It's good !

03:58.999 --> 03:59.748
Pull !

04:03.118 --> 04:04.468
Yeah !

04:05.901 --> 04:07.192
Almost there...

04:18.286 --> 04:19.320
Set it ! Set it !

04:19.343 --> 04:20.764
Ok placer.

04:29.232 --> 04:31.024
- It's good ?
- It's great.

04:31.719 --> 04:33.445
It's a lot heavier than I remember.

04:33.469 --> 04:35.970
You're gonna have to learn
now, to pace yourself, you're,

04:36.005 --> 04:38.060
you're only human now, remember ?

04:38.635 --> 04:39.443
Martha ?

04:45.243 --> 04:48.296
Ah the joy of the manual labour.

04:48.848 --> 04:51.027
It's not so bad, I
kinda like being sore.

04:51.074 --> 04:53.187
It makes me feel like
I accomplish something.

04:53.316 --> 04:55.336
No pain, no gain, right ?

04:56.604 --> 04:59.879
Yeah, well, being immemorial that
has his drawbacks. You 're all right ?

04:59.915 --> 05:00.596
Aow !

05:04.952 --> 05:07.195
Are you sure this is
what you really want ?

05:11.891 --> 05:13.370
It's what I've always wanted.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.666
I was talking about you Clark,
not your feelings with Lana.

05:19.382 --> 05:22.936
I mean, one day I've got my
best friend with superpowers,

05:22.984 --> 05:28.033
and the next day, the superhero
is just a Kansas farmboy.

05:28.068 --> 05:30.872
Excuse me if I find this
a little hard to accept.

05:30.907 --> 05:32.915
Well you're gonna
have to get used to it.

05:33.255 --> 05:34.418
This is who I am now.

05:35.874 --> 05:38.474
Clark, with all that you're able to do

05:38.509 --> 05:41.914
I just can't help but thinking that
your destiny is more than just...

05:41.961 --> 05:44.016
milking cows and raising porks.

05:44.056 --> 05:46.229
Yes, but this is just another
word for not having a choice.

05:46.276 --> 05:48.978
Ok, what about alien Ken and Barbie.

05:49.037 --> 05:50.857
They tore apart
Smallville looking for you.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.325
They were looking for Kal-El.

05:52.794 --> 05:54.180
They're gone, and so is he.

05:55.037 --> 05:56.340
Just let it go, allright ?

06:04.095 --> 06:04.811
- Here.
- Thank you.

06:07.065 --> 06:08.742
I've never been so thirsty.

06:09.985 --> 06:11.089
It's incredible isn't it ?

06:11.112 --> 06:14.365
How the entire town get together
to help rebuild Smallville.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.785
Yeah, well thanks to Lex.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.421
If he ain't pull those strings
we'd still be waiting for the money.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.854
He's a really good help.

06:23.635 --> 06:24.609
Hey Clark !

06:24.749 --> 06:27.543
We're getting out of nails, can
you run to the farm and grab some ?

06:27.578 --> 06:28.189
Yeah.

06:29.058 --> 06:30.185
I'll come with you.

06:30.549 --> 06:31.148
Yeah.

06:41.198 --> 06:42.442
The happy couple.

06:46.765 --> 06:48.808
Sneaking out while
there's work to be done.

06:49.513 --> 06:50.476
Flaired am I !

06:52.824 --> 06:54.245
Hum, I'll wait for you.

06:59.947 --> 07:02.707
I get the feeling I'm not
the favorite person right now.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.515
She doesn't trust you.

07:07.297 --> 07:10.837
I'm sure you're... used to that
kind of reaction from people by now.

07:11.212 --> 07:13.314
Look Clark, we've all made mistakes.

07:14.112 --> 07:15.462
That's in the past.

07:16.108 --> 07:18.680
For unknow reasons we've
been given a second chance.

07:19.584 --> 07:21.909
I hope we can rebuild
more than just a town.

07:24.830 --> 07:25.793
So do I.

08:06.993 --> 08:09.909
I can't believe a second
meteor shower hit Smallville.

08:10.085 --> 08:12.962
I think the first when we
were kids wasn't bad enough.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.264
Maybe this time it's different.

08:16.074 --> 08:18.129
Maybe it's not the end of
something but the beginning.

08:18.307 --> 08:19.470
A second chance.

08:22.311 --> 08:25.082
Clark there are so many
things that I haven't told you.

08:25.411 --> 08:26.677
Things that I've done.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.855
Whatever we've both done
it's in the past now.

08:32.828 --> 08:34.614
The past can't hurt us anymore.

08:39.626 --> 08:40.696
You're right.

08:41.881 --> 08:43.490
No more cristals,

08:43.960 --> 08:45.052
or spaceships,

08:45.780 --> 08:47.363
no more meteor showers.

08:47.609 --> 08:48.971
That sounds good to me.

09:09.928 --> 09:11.102
Take a sit.

09:11.126 --> 09:12.288
No hurry.

09:12.323 --> 09:14.002
I think I need a break anyway.

09:15.999 --> 09:16.832
Found them.

09:18.568 --> 09:21.974
You know, sometimes taking
your time isn't a bad idea.

09:23.347 --> 09:24.017
Sorry.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.588
I'ts okay.

09:27.917 --> 09:31.192
Hum, we should probably
be hanging back, anyway.

09:31.897 --> 09:32.684
You're right.

09:33.858 --> 09:36.427
We should probably... be hanging back.

09:47.657 --> 09:50.170
Everyone is waiting for
us at the barn raising.

09:52.506 --> 09:54.772
Which means we're all alone.

10:38.155 --> 10:39.341
We should hum...

10:39.811 --> 10:41.384
we should take this slow.

10:42.159 --> 10:45.400
Clark, we've been taking
it slow for four years now.

10:45.435 --> 10:46.797
I know that's just hum...

10:48.934 --> 10:50.153
I want a first time...

10:51.879 --> 10:53.664
to be as special as you are.

10:57.398 --> 10:58.300
So...

11:00.707 --> 11:02.186
it's my first time.

11:08.475 --> 11:09.520
It's mine too.

11:13.442 --> 11:15.543
- You and Jason...
- No...

11:17.587 --> 11:18.836
You and Alicia ?

11:20.101 --> 11:20.735
No.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.716
You're the only one
I've ever really loved.

11:29.298 --> 11:31.094
It's only been you Lana.

12:01.476 --> 12:02.921
Oh, my parents.

12:02.944 --> 12:03.766
Hum...

12:04.177 --> 12:05.633
Hey mum, dad !

12:07.075 --> 12:09.964
We were just... hum...

12:11.784 --> 12:12.699
We were just...

12:16.363 --> 12:17.224
Clark !

12:19.538 --> 12:20.759
Pretty girl !

12:20.806 --> 12:21.992
I approve.

12:23.506 --> 12:24.570
What do you want ?

12:24.606 --> 12:28.269
Whatever the freaks didn't stop
talking in Belle Reeves Clarkie boy...

12:30.242 --> 12:31.005
You !

12:40.165 --> 12:41.562
Get in there !

12:43.039 --> 12:43.744
Lana.

12:45.352 --> 12:46.239
Stop it !

12:46.362 --> 12:47.172
Stop ?

12:47.930 --> 12:50.031
Fonzie is getting started baby girl.

12:50.067 --> 12:52.223
Clark what's going on ? Who are they ?

12:52.251 --> 12:53.096
I don't know.

12:53.119 --> 12:54.716
Oh but we know you.

12:54.740 --> 12:58.589
Your legend back in Belle Reeves, there
are lots of freaks in there because of you.

12:58.624 --> 13:00.350
What is he talking about ?

13:00.421 --> 13:01.806
You got the wrong guy.

13:02.147 --> 13:03.051
Oh yeah ?

13:04.530 --> 13:07.979
Maybe sweetie here can
help me find the right one.

13:08.308 --> 13:09.189
No !

13:13.796 --> 13:14.571
Clark !

13:17.237 --> 13:19.738
Boy, you're not wanted
to pissing me off !

13:20.313 --> 13:23.152
Strange. He did not
seem how we expected.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.559
I told you, you got the wrong guy.

13:27.577 --> 13:29.725
Well then I guess we're
just gonna have to kill you.

13:30.254 --> 13:33.154
Or maybe I should start
with your little girlfriend.

14:14.809 --> 14:15.748
All right Clark.

14:16.946 --> 14:18.989
As long as you're
happy with who you are.

14:23.684 --> 14:26.444
Happiness is such an
elusive creature, isn't it ?

14:29.849 --> 14:31.598
We all wish for it but,

14:31.968 --> 14:33.788
very few ever really find it.

14:33.824 --> 14:36.066
Doesn't make the search
any less important.

14:36.113 --> 14:37.487
Or the destination.

14:45.206 --> 14:47.507
Remember the last time
we stood here together ?

14:49.339 --> 14:53.860
I ended up unconscious on the ground,
and you somehow landed in the Arctic.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.709
I told you I don't
remember what happened.

14:55.745 --> 14:57.553
Then why have you been
avoiding me Chloe ?

14:58.375 --> 15:01.979
It's been weeks since I brought you back
from the hospital in Yukon where I found you.

15:02.015 --> 15:03.377
I've been busy, Lex.

15:03.400 --> 15:03.985
Right.

15:04.666 --> 15:07.495
I heard being a third wheel
is very time consuming.

15:13.616 --> 15:15.612
Clark and Lana are finally together.

15:15.647 --> 15:16.598
They're happy.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.463
That's all that should
matter to a real friend.

15:23.197 --> 15:25.473
I think you know more
than you're telling me.

15:26.013 --> 15:29.183
About what happened to you in those
caves, about Clark's involvement.

15:29.594 --> 15:33.222
I know you think you're being a good friend,
but you're playing a very dangerous game.

15:34.341 --> 15:38.498
Kinda like covering a spaceship Lana
said crashed during the meteor shower ?

15:38.545 --> 15:41.398
Lana was hysterical. She didn't
see what she thought she did.

15:41.422 --> 15:43.334
Or maybe you didn't either, Lex.

15:45.189 --> 15:48.793
Stop asking me questions, or
I will start asking my own.

16:08.189 --> 16:09.316
Level 3.

16:09.751 --> 16:10.819
So you've heard of it.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.323
Yeah. It's supposed to be a
top secret research facility.

16:15.372 --> 16:16.393
At Luthorcorp.

16:16.816 --> 16:18.154
Everybody thinks it's just a mess.

16:18.190 --> 16:21.195
Yeah. Spending a couple of weeks
in there can make it pretty real.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.771
You've been in level 3 ?

16:24.217 --> 16:26.248
Oh yeah I had a real nice day.

16:26.272 --> 16:28.761
Home made food, satellite TV, and a

16:28.796 --> 16:31.682
nity little green cocktail shot
in my neck three times a day.

16:31.717 --> 16:32.844
They were experimenting on you ?

16:32.880 --> 16:35.733
They just tried some things
on me and the ones out there.

16:35.968 --> 16:36.649
It worked.

16:37.835 --> 16:40.077
They wanted more and I
wake up in Belle Reeves.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.368
No more

16:42.107 --> 16:44.690
satellite TV, no more green cocktails.

16:44.726 --> 16:46.475
They got you hooked
and then cut you off.

16:48.577 --> 16:51.125
Look we're all gonna cross
the peak kid, this is yours,

16:51.172 --> 16:53.983
you're gonna break into level 3,
you're gonna get me that serum.

16:54.382 --> 16:57.130
Otherwise we're gonna be playing
the poor cowboy and lonesome.

16:57.412 --> 16:58.844
What do you need me for ?

16:59.701 --> 17:01.253
I've seen what you can do.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.615
Why don't you get in
there and get it yourself ?

17:02.650 --> 17:06.020
They got all kinds of defend
systems that keep people like me out.

17:06.607 --> 17:10.045
But if the story I heard about
you in Belle Reeves is true,

17:10.396 --> 17:11.946
you shouldn't have any problem.

17:29.574 --> 17:31.523
Looks like we got some company.

17:35.891 --> 17:38.874
Clark better have a good excuse
for not bringing those nails back.

17:38.910 --> 17:40.319
I'm sure he does.

17:43.501 --> 17:44.229
Clark ?

17:46.143 --> 17:46.870
Clark,

17:47.680 --> 17:50.099
I sent you after those nails
hours ago, what happened ?

17:50.123 --> 17:51.297
I got sidetrack.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.166
Where is Lana ?

17:54.488 --> 17:56.903
She's not feeling
well, she's lying down.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.747
Why is your shirt on inside out ?

18:04.328 --> 18:05.972
I think I'll go check on Lana myself.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.675
No wait ! You guys never believe me,

18:07.710 --> 18:10.528
why you guys are always over me, why
can't you just back off for five minutes ?

18:10.563 --> 18:13.017
Oh Kent, what's gotten into you ?

18:14.165 --> 18:15.504
Yeah boy,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.923
that ain't no way to talk to your mom !

18:20.823 --> 18:22.185
What's going on here Clark ?

18:22.220 --> 18:24.085
Hi ya old man !

18:26.327 --> 18:27.478
Listen fella,

18:27.799 --> 18:29.967
I don't know who the hell
you think you're talking to...

18:33.972 --> 18:35.675
Stop ! Just stop !

18:36.649 --> 18:38.775
I'll do whatever you want,
just don't hurt anyone else.

18:39.268 --> 18:41.229
Smart move farmboy.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.127
You've got two hours to get
back here with the serum.

18:44.538 --> 18:47.004
Or I'm gonna fire the
barn as a barbecue.

19:04.318 --> 19:05.434
All I know,

19:05.457 --> 19:08.040
is that the serum is in a vault,
somewhere in there in level three.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.330
What about Lex ?

19:10.353 --> 19:12.582
I mean if we just told
him what was going on...

19:12.605 --> 19:14.930
No I called his office they
said he was in Washington.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.750
That's up to us Chloe,
we've got to get in there.

19:18.077 --> 19:20.754
Well, I'm always up for
a new mission impossible.

19:21.054 --> 19:24.354
Ok so, this is where your nut
said he was experiment today.

19:24.389 --> 19:25.011
Yeah.

19:25.035 --> 19:29.334
Well, according to publical records, this
section of Luthorcorp was closed a year ago.

19:29.557 --> 19:31.048
Turned into storage.

19:31.072 --> 19:33.256
Its great cover if you don't want
anyone to nkow what you're up to.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.087
It's exactly what I thought.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.026
Now,

19:36.496 --> 19:40.699
I couldn't pull up anything called top
secret evil lab on the schematics, but

19:40.723 --> 19:42.140
I did find this.

19:42.187 --> 19:45.110
Or, more accurately, didn't.

19:46.273 --> 19:47.118
Level 3.

19:47.964 --> 19:50.511
I guess someone forgot
to paint a light in.

19:57.961 --> 19:58.607
Wow !

20:00.814 --> 20:02.620
What ? I like to come prepared.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.356
Chloe where did you get all this stuff ?

20:05.403 --> 20:06.248
I bought them !

20:06.941 --> 20:07.516
Hey,

20:07.854 --> 20:09.313
is that a flashbang grenade ?

20:09.345 --> 20:10.566
Oh, careful.

20:10.942 --> 20:13.067
It's a... graduation present from Lois.

20:13.701 --> 20:15.286
I'm saving it for a special occasion.

20:16.226 --> 20:18.208
Why didn't you tell me
about all this stuff ?

20:19.734 --> 20:21.437
We all have our secrets, Clark.

20:43.269 --> 20:46.851
Relax, Clark. We still have a couple of
minutes before the guards swing back round.

20:46.921 --> 20:48.269
Are you sure, this is gonna work ?

20:48.304 --> 20:49.795
You have a better plan ?

20:50.300 --> 20:53.001
Whaou, normally I
just rip open the door.

20:53.036 --> 20:57.122
then speed to pass cameras and somehow
open the vault or whatever with my

20:57.225 --> 20:58.059
heat vision.

20:59.339 --> 21:02.873
So, what you are saying is that now that you're
human you have absolutely no useful skills.

21:04.082 --> 21:05.127
Not so much.

21:05.691 --> 21:06.252
Great.

21:06.851 --> 21:09.916
I bring my own superhero,
and this is what I get.

21:11.501 --> 21:13.497
But we don't need superpowers for this.

21:13.650 --> 21:16.391
You get the door open and then
access the surevillance cameras.

21:16.456 --> 21:18.610
and then loop the same empty
hallway over and over, and I...

21:18.646 --> 21:19.374
Clark ?

21:20.495 --> 21:23.808
That kind of electronic programs
is gonna take hours to set up.

21:23.925 --> 21:25.792
sometimes, it's easier to just...

21:27.976 --> 21:29.385
turn off the power.

21:50.356 --> 21:52.787
Looks like the kid don't win
and called the law on us...

21:52.810 --> 21:54.630
Unless he doesn't love you very much.

21:54.654 --> 21:56.850
- Clark wouldn't go to the police.
- I'm sure it's just routine.

21:56.885 --> 21:58.552
Yeah, too bad for her then.

21:58.576 --> 22:00.877
Wait, we'll get rid of
her, just dont freak out.

22:02.133 --> 22:04.106
Baby, you'll know when I freak out.

22:08.671 --> 22:11.513
Now get rid of the sheriff,
or your wife's toast.

22:15.237 --> 22:16.505
Just a second !

22:21.953 --> 22:22.681
Sheriff.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.778
Ah, I'm sorry to
trouble you folks but...

22:25.813 --> 22:29.219
3 real means busted out
of Belle Reeves last night.

22:29.254 --> 22:33.328
They didn't go to a hospital and we saw the
car they stole about a mile off the road.

22:33.363 --> 22:34.655
We'll keep our eyes open.

22:34.678 --> 22:36.169
Maye you should do that.

22:38.130 --> 22:39.011
Where is the Misses ?

22:41.794 --> 22:43.285
She's still at the barn raising.

22:43.801 --> 22:46.091
Ah ? She's there. I didn't see her.

22:48.791 --> 22:52.138
Make sure she knows what's
going on when she turns up.

22:52.255 --> 22:53.828
We sure will, thank you.

22:53.873 --> 22:54.895
Wait a minute,

23:00.202 --> 23:01.669
Is that coffee still warm ?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.556
We're running out of time.

23:12.603 --> 23:14.178
There is gonna be an
other way to do this.

23:14.202 --> 23:15.317
No Clark, there isn't.

23:15.340 --> 23:20.319
The only direct access to level 3
is through magnetically sealed door.

23:20.354 --> 23:24.168
You have to get in through the air fence and
unlock the magnetically closed door from the inside.

23:24.191 --> 23:25.447
How much longer ?

23:25.624 --> 23:27.232
Well according to the air vent diagram,

23:27.267 --> 23:30.520
Then you should be getting close to
an exhaust door, right above the room.

23:32.491 --> 23:33.735
Take your next left.

23:37.857 --> 23:39.348
Come on Clark ! Left !

23:44.551 --> 23:45.866
I'm going in circles.

23:45.901 --> 23:46.876
No, you're not,

23:46.899 --> 23:50.445
it just feels that way because you're in a
confine space with no vision of the course.

23:52.277 --> 23:54.816
This is impossible, it's
a million degrees in here.

23:55.086 --> 23:58.092
Gosh Clark, I didn't realise super
wanning was one of your powers.

23:58.127 --> 24:01.050
Pete was a lot better
in this situations.

24:01.097 --> 24:01.814
Pete ?

24:03.737 --> 24:05.745
You told Pete your secret ?

24:05.780 --> 24:07.753
I kinda had to, he saw my ship.

24:07.777 --> 24:08.340
What ?

24:08.493 --> 24:10.418
Pete got to see your spaceship ?

24:12.764 --> 24:13.915
What was that ?

24:15.395 --> 24:16.651
Oh no...

24:16.710 --> 24:19.422
I think you triggerred some
sort of lock on protocol.

24:19.445 --> 24:20.068
What ?

24:20.725 --> 24:22.099
What do I do ?

24:22.237 --> 24:24.527
Go ! Go go go go !

24:30.022 --> 24:31.053
Take your left !

24:31.969 --> 24:33.155
I said left !

24:33.601 --> 24:35.515
Go hurry !

24:38.165 --> 24:38.810
Waow !

24:40.208 --> 24:40.900
Clark ?

24:41.182 --> 24:42.251
Clark can you hear me ?

24:43.084 --> 24:43.648
Clark ?

24:44.223 --> 24:45.550
Clark are you okay ?

24:50.636 --> 24:51.705
Yeah, super.

25:00.417 --> 25:01.944
Good coffee Mr Kent.

25:02.437 --> 25:03.846
Thanks sheriff.

25:04.433 --> 25:07.944
Would you mind if I finish the rest of my chores
while there's still some daylight out there ?

25:07.979 --> 25:08.986
Oh, right.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.806
Yeah I should get going myself.

25:11.863 --> 25:13.284
Thanks for the coffee.

25:20.307 --> 25:24.440
I wouldn't think a man with your heart
condition would take this poison Mr Kent.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.316
Those are mine, sheriff.

25:27.575 --> 25:30.111
You know I, started
after the meteor shower.

25:32.436 --> 25:33.739
Nerves.

25:36.405 --> 25:38.072
Yes they happen miss Lang.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.385
You have to quit before they kill you.

25:42.237 --> 25:44.093
Thanks again for your hospitality.

25:44.457 --> 25:45.960
I'll let myself out.

25:59.402 --> 26:03.541
All units, we got a 10
level at the Kent farm.

26:03.576 --> 26:04.856
Hey sheriff !

26:14.784 --> 26:15.711
Mr Kent !

26:42.136 --> 26:44.003
That really... hurt !

26:45.001 --> 26:46.692
Get the field up !

27:32.216 --> 27:33.343
Check him out !

27:41.778 --> 27:43.681
We're in a bad pickle.

27:49.687 --> 27:51.237
Clark, how is it going ?

27:51.260 --> 27:51.988
Well...

27:52.798 --> 27:54.560
I'm not really crazy about height.

27:56.027 --> 27:56.790
Ok.

27:58.223 --> 27:59.949
Chloe, what am I looking for ?

27:59.985 --> 28:03.190
Ok. Hum, just a really big door.

28:05.104 --> 28:06.372
Door, door.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.499
- I got it.
- Ok.

28:19.523 --> 28:22.540
Now look for the manual overide switch.

28:24.008 --> 28:24.830
Good work.

28:25.675 --> 28:27.665
I guess we didn't have
any trouble with the guards

28:27.712 --> 28:31.833
No, it was weird actually. It was like
there were only guards in the outside.

28:33.650 --> 28:34.402
Wahou.

28:36.586 --> 28:37.866
Can you get us in ?

28:40.484 --> 28:41.165
No.

28:41.736 --> 28:44.660
The locking mechanism control
is by finger print access.

28:44.871 --> 28:46.632
There is gotta be a way to bypass it.

28:48.452 --> 28:51.971
Maybe, if I have like
a week or Lex's thumb...

28:53.462 --> 28:55.223
Lex's thumb print ?

28:57.934 --> 28:58.603
What ?

29:14.517 --> 29:16.302
What the hell is this, sheriff ?

29:19.074 --> 29:20.929
An other day in Smallville.

29:22.221 --> 29:24.147
We... can not...

29:24.217 --> 29:26.566
maintain... the field.

29:26.601 --> 29:30.123
Stop finish each other's sentences,
you're starting to grade on me.

29:31.052 --> 29:33.189
We need... the serum.

29:33.212 --> 29:37.803
You ain't the only who needs an injection, you
keep that field up, right. We're almost home.

29:38.481 --> 29:39.339
Perhaps...

29:39.691 --> 29:41.464
We should host

29:41.487 --> 29:42.509
our losses

29:42.532 --> 29:46.924
No ! We're gonna stick to the plan,
wait for the Kent boy to get back

29:47.323 --> 29:50.946
and then we're off the hooks, now
you guys shut up, you concentrate.

29:53.165 --> 29:56.112
Is this just me or they're
starting to look desperate ?

29:56.662 --> 29:58.341
Don't worry, Ms Kent.

29:58.905 --> 30:00.971
Clark will figure a way
to get us out of this.

30:01.535 --> 30:02.815
He always does.

30:10.979 --> 30:12.165
Is that gonna do it ?

30:12.200 --> 30:14.267
It'd better it's our last finger print.

30:14.302 --> 30:15.887
All right, give me the tape.

30:17.050 --> 30:17.814
Thank you.

30:24.434 --> 30:25.198
Hello.

30:26.372 --> 30:28.215
Time is up, brag boy.

30:28.732 --> 30:30.399
I want my stuff.

30:33.163 --> 30:34.689
I got it. I'm on my way.

30:34.725 --> 30:36.286
You'd better be.

30:41.957 --> 30:43.836
Who needs super powers with you around ?

30:50.215 --> 30:51.061
Clark !

31:02.202 --> 31:03.764
He has got a couple of minutes

31:03.787 --> 31:05.960
then I'm gonna start
killing some people,

31:09.938 --> 31:11.477
starting with you, mum.

31:13.344 --> 31:15.633
Can you disrupt the signal ?
It might shut the grid down.

31:15.668 --> 31:18.448
Well. I can try but that can take hours.

31:18.730 --> 31:20.691
Chloe, I already told
him I had the serum.

31:21.243 --> 31:23.356
Can't you call him back and see
if he can give you more time ?

31:23.378 --> 31:24.810
He's not a more time kind of guy !

31:24.846 --> 31:29.671
Clark, we don't have a choice. I mean you can't just walk in
there without your abilities. The lasers would put you to pieces.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.570
There might be another way.

31:33.826 --> 31:35.634
Can you find out where
the signal is coming from ?

31:35.669 --> 31:36.820
What are you gonna do ?

31:37.501 --> 31:38.628
Whatever it takes.

31:53.164 --> 31:53.962
Sheriff !

31:54.126 --> 31:55.160
Hey, wait !

31:55.195 --> 31:56.064
Sheriff !

31:56.346 --> 31:57.755
Let him through !

31:58.330 --> 32:01.888
- What in a place do you think you're doing, Mr Kent ?
- I'm trying to save my parents...

32:01.936 --> 32:03.897
... and Lana. Please you have
to pull your men back now.

32:03.933 --> 32:06.596
Last time I checked hours at one when
wearing the badge and barking the orders.

32:06.619 --> 32:08.122
I can stop this !

32:08.158 --> 32:09.719
This is not the time to be a hero !

32:09.760 --> 32:10.664
I'm not !

32:11.580 --> 32:12.249
Look,

32:12.979 --> 32:16.067
I'm just a normal guy that doesn't
want to see everyone he loves die.

32:16.314 --> 32:17.324
Please, sheriff.

32:17.641 --> 32:19.590
You have to trust me. I can do this.

32:21.631 --> 32:24.684
Even if I lost all sense
and I gave you the ok,

32:24.731 --> 32:28.887
there is some kind of invisible
barrier around in the whole place.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.975
How do you plan to get past that ?

32:36.842 --> 32:37.664
With this.

32:39.202 --> 32:41.844
Right that's an easy kid,
I'm feeling kinda torchy.

32:41.879 --> 32:43.279
Get the force field down.

32:43.314 --> 32:44.125
He did it.

32:44.371 --> 32:46.614
Look. Shut up ! He did nothing yet.

32:49.937 --> 32:52.242
Allright get the field
back up. Get it up !

32:53.885 --> 32:54.895
Hurry up !

32:55.236 --> 32:57.091
I thought you forgot about us.

32:57.114 --> 32:59.063
Don't worry. Everything is gonna be ok.

32:59.099 --> 33:01.247
No, there's nothing ok 'till I say so.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.636
You really did the job at Luthorcorp ?

33:03.871 --> 33:05.714
They made me more than I was,

33:05.773 --> 33:07.182
I didn't ask for it.

33:07.217 --> 33:09.143
The power grows on you very fast.

33:11.433 --> 33:13.746
I guessed all the talk
about you was true boy,

33:15.164 --> 33:16.948
you really are out of this world

33:16.984 --> 33:18.275
You have no idea.

33:54.173 --> 33:56.826
Sometimes, it is easier
just to turn the power off.

34:02.122 --> 34:03.614
Get him out of here.

34:03.635 --> 34:04.269
Let's go.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.627
Keep moving, Sparky.

34:17.942 --> 34:20.366
That guy has some serious issues.

34:20.413 --> 34:22.491
Let's hope Belle Reeves
can hold him this time.

34:22.702 --> 34:25.262
You can always knock
his light out again.

34:25.284 --> 34:29.148
Or call the authorities before you
hatch another hero rescue's game.

34:29.195 --> 34:30.272
Sorry, sheriff.

34:31.810 --> 34:33.206
That aside,

34:33.242 --> 34:35.262
nice work, Mr Kent.

34:35.708 --> 34:38.114
You have ever consider a
career in law enforcement ?

34:40.358 --> 34:42.013
She's right, Clark.

34:43.045 --> 34:44.889
What you did was amazing.

34:46.322 --> 34:46.967
Hi !

34:48.952 --> 34:49.585
Hey !

34:49.960 --> 34:50.746
Eh,

34:52.414 --> 34:53.940
- Give us a second ?
- Of course.

34:56.676 --> 34:58.965
Breaking news. Clark Kent saves the day.

34:59.522 --> 35:00.556
Thanks to you.

35:00.591 --> 35:02.740
Yeah, well. I just
did what I usually do.

35:02.775 --> 35:05.851
You are the one who took down
three meteor freaks without any

35:06.215 --> 35:08.364
special advantages.

35:10.039 --> 35:11.906
Then again: once a hero, always a hero.

35:11.941 --> 35:13.280
No. It's a one time thing.

35:13.315 --> 35:14.759
I'm done with all that now.

35:17.237 --> 35:21.274
Clark, you may have moved on, but other
people are not gonna let go the past time.

35:21.321 --> 35:22.458
We talked about this, Chloe.

35:22.493 --> 35:24.371
I am not the one you should worry about.

35:25.933 --> 35:28.540
I traced the carrier signal
I picked up in the vault.

35:28.575 --> 35:32.080
I found a secondary video
feed hidden in the frequency.

35:32.703 --> 35:34.288
Someone was watching us.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.020
This is impossible.

35:45.067 --> 35:46.041
Disappointed ?

35:47.521 --> 35:48.249
Clark,

35:50.034 --> 35:52.135
I heard about what happened;
is everyone allright ?

35:58.885 --> 35:59.801
What are you doing ?

35:59.833 --> 36:01.736
What I should have done a long time ago.

36:03.919 --> 36:06.197
Chloe traced the video
feed from level three.

36:06.573 --> 36:08.358
You were watching us the whole time.

36:08.910 --> 36:10.857
I don't know what you are talking about.

36:13.746 --> 36:15.777
She also pulled security
records in Belle Reeves,

36:15.824 --> 36:18.102
you were there when the psychos escaped.

36:18.407 --> 36:20.154
And you helped them somehow didn't you ?

36:21.493 --> 36:23.090
What do you promiss them, Lex ?

36:23.125 --> 36:25.027
Enough serum to last
the rest of their lives ?

36:25.062 --> 36:26.084
You're being irrational.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.614
This whole thing was a set up, a test !

36:31.447 --> 36:33.948
And you put Lana and
my family in danger.

36:33.983 --> 36:34.723
Clark.

36:34.758 --> 36:35.368
No.

36:38.034 --> 36:39.701
I thought we could start over, Lex.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.893
But you are too obsessed
by the past, with me.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.439
But I'm different now. I'm
through playing games with you.

36:47.578 --> 36:49.092
You wanna test me ?

36:49.128 --> 36:52.261
You wanna see what I'm really made
of, do it yourself, you coward.

37:07.751 --> 37:08.702
Satisfied ?

37:28.067 --> 37:28.948
Clark !

37:32.782 --> 37:34.027
What happened ?

37:34.050 --> 37:36.000
I said goodbye to an old friend.

37:38.031 --> 37:40.332
Have you ever heard about handshake ?

37:42.520 --> 37:43.448
Come here.

37:51.888 --> 37:53.074
Right.

37:58.299 --> 37:58.945
Aow !

38:00.671 --> 38:01.470
Sorry.

38:03.536 --> 38:04.429
God,

38:04.758 --> 38:05.908
you are mess.

38:11.744 --> 38:13.798
With everything that has happened,

38:16.322 --> 38:19.176
I thought I knew what my
life would be like now.

38:21.254 --> 38:22.264
I thought it...

38:23.112 --> 38:24.228
would be easier.

38:30.016 --> 38:33.269
But I guess you can never be certain
of what is gonna happen tomorrow,

38:34.846 --> 38:35.797
can you ?

38:41.222 --> 38:41.974
No.

38:43.793 --> 38:44.960
No, you can't.
