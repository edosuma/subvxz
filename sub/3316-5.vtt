00:36.356 --> 00:37.529
Mr. Goodman?

00:38.948 --> 00:42.294
Mr. Goodman was my father,
<i>alev hashalom.</i>

00:42.437 --> 00:43.667
Please call me Sam.

00:46.697 --> 00:49.180
I am sorry we have
to meet like this,

00:50.144 --> 00:53.497
but confidentiality is the
heart and soul of my work.

00:53.618 --> 00:58.578
Yes, uh, Mother Claudia
explained all that to me.

00:59.725 --> 01:02.455
She's the only one
who knows I'm here.

01:02.588 --> 01:04.479
I'd like to keep it that way.

01:05.197 --> 01:08.988
The monsignor,
he thinks I've lost my mind,

01:09.113 --> 01:11.795
but I haven't.

01:11.914 --> 01:14.648
I, um... I trust my instincts.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.614
Instincts are everything.

01:16.739 --> 01:19.191
We ignore them at our peril.

01:21.780 --> 01:25.267
Do I...
pay you for this?

01:25.386 --> 01:27.698
No, no, no, no.
I don't do this for money.

01:28.328 --> 01:30.835
It's more of a calling.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.683
Did you lose someone?

01:41.263 --> 01:43.217
Everyone.

01:44.607 --> 01:45.956
Is that for me?

01:46.544 --> 01:47.632
Um...

01:48.534 --> 01:49.709
Please sit.

01:49.821 --> 01:50.947
Thank you.

01:51.870 --> 01:54.365
He goes by the name Arden,

01:55.212 --> 01:58.194
but I believe his real name
may be Grouper.

01:58.597 --> 02:01.529
He may have been an SS doctor.

02:02.681 --> 02:06.342
I mean, there's hardly
anything at all in there.

02:06.582 --> 02:11.120
Um, just a home address,
and even that my be a lie.

02:12.321 --> 02:14.452
Probably is a lie, all of it.

02:14.644 --> 02:15.762
What do you mean?

02:16.618 --> 02:19.434
Have you heard
of Operation Paperclip?

02:21.582 --> 02:25.724
After the war, the Joint
Intelligence Objectives Agency

02:25.850 --> 02:29.296
actively recruited
the best Nazi scientists.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.103
To get around Truman's
express orders

02:32.229 --> 02:34.004
to exclude Nazi supporters,

02:34.203 --> 02:38.380
they created false biographies
for these men.

02:39.890 --> 02:40.966
Forgive the question,

02:41.105 --> 02:45.818
but have you ever seen him
without a shirt on?

02:46.582 --> 02:47.513
Me?

02:47.626 --> 02:49.376
Oh, no, no, never.

02:49.462 --> 02:53.220
SS have a tattoo
of their blood type here.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.566
It's how they were
easily identified

02:56.767 --> 02:59.467
by the Allied Forces
after the liberation.

03:01.452 --> 03:04.075
Do I need to look for it?

03:04.199 --> 03:05.388
No, no, no.

03:05.726 --> 03:07.689
In fact, don't do anything

03:07.849 --> 03:09.974
until I've completed my work.

03:10.096 --> 03:12.226
If he is who you suspect,

03:12.435 --> 03:14.470
the last thing you want to do

03:14.644 --> 03:16.125
is corner him.

03:23.539 --> 03:24.613
Dr. Arden?

03:24.735 --> 03:26.613
Stop. You leave him there.

03:26.924 --> 03:28.189
Where's Sister Jude?

03:28.625 --> 03:29.950
I have to speak
to her right away.

03:30.117 --> 03:31.738
This man is a monster.

03:32.354 --> 03:34.135
You should see what
he's got in his office.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.460
Go, Sister.

03:40.807 --> 03:42.344
I've waited
so many years for this.

03:43.001 --> 03:44.605
I can wait a few more minutes.

03:45.056 --> 03:47.623
Drop the gun, or I'll blow
your goddamn head off.

05:02.586 --> 05:04.695
You put up a
bit of a fight, I hear.

05:05.795 --> 05:07.348
You had to be sedated.

05:08.178 --> 05:10.134
Where did you
get the gun, Anne?

05:10.405 --> 05:11.364
I took it off

05:11.850 --> 05:13.618
one of those detectives.

05:15.426 --> 05:17.147
And it's a good thing I did.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.771
He would've killed me.

05:18.895 --> 05:19.951
Dr. Arden?

05:20.097 --> 05:21.122
Grouper.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.953
Hans Grouper, I told you.

05:23.066 --> 05:24.104
He's a Nazi.

05:24.207 --> 05:25.356
The thing in his lab,

05:25.479 --> 05:27.390
- did you see it?
- What thing?

05:27.572 --> 05:29.397
Tell me, what do you
think you saw?

05:29.556 --> 05:32.141
Oh, God. He got rid of it
before anyone could see.

05:32.260 --> 05:35.618
Dr. Arden was in no condition
to do any such thing.

05:35.746 --> 05:38.111
When I arrived, he was being
rushed to the hospital.

05:38.221 --> 05:39.717
Good. I hope he dies.

05:39.826 --> 05:41.640
Now, come on, wake up.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.529
He's not going to die.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.348
He'll be back here and soon.

05:45.507 --> 05:48.345
Maybe with the police,
maybe with the monsignor.

05:48.504 --> 05:50.971
You could end up
on his operating table,

05:51.181 --> 05:53.982
and I out on the street,
so before that happens,

05:54.346 --> 05:55.852
I want you to tell me

05:56.132 --> 05:58.102
what you think you saw.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.876
Go and look.

06:03.815 --> 06:05.347
<i>We did look.</i>

06:11.363 --> 06:14.810
<i>Now, Frank says you claimed</i>
<i>to have seen</i>

06:15.501 --> 06:18.269
<i>some sort of creature</i>
<i>that was alive.</i>

06:29.114 --> 06:30.832
<i>Maybe it escaped on its own.</i>

06:31.412 --> 06:32.662
I doubt that, Sister.

06:34.558 --> 06:36.452
It had no legs.

06:37.683 --> 06:38.953
Sister Jude?

06:39.256 --> 06:40.373
Can't you see I'm busy?

06:40.776 --> 06:42.307
There's a man in your office.

06:42.696 --> 06:43.868
What man?

06:44.452 --> 06:45.818
Did he say what he wanted?

06:46.517 --> 06:47.783
His wife.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.327
<i>Her name is Charlotte.</i>

06:52.454 --> 06:53.668
Charlotte Brown
is her married name.

06:53.794 --> 06:55.461
She was born Charlotte Cohen.

06:55.787 --> 06:57.106
That's our son, David.

06:57.229 --> 06:58.542
He's a sweet little boy,

06:58.702 --> 07:00.023
but he has the colic.

07:00.256 --> 07:02.389
He cries five,
six times a night.

07:02.498 --> 07:04.041
Nothing we can do
to comfort him.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.916
It's enough to make anyone
a little cuckoo,

07:06.115 --> 07:09.063
especially a woman
as high-strung as Charlotte.

07:09.576 --> 07:11.331
Cuckoo.

07:12.048 --> 07:13.442
High-strung.

07:14.122 --> 07:16.351
How about
world-class actress?

07:17.183 --> 07:19.034
She was very convincing,

07:20.036 --> 07:21.765
playing Anne Frank.

07:21.967 --> 07:22.921
That's how it all started.

07:23.029 --> 07:24.261
She read the diary,

07:24.401 --> 07:25.587
and when she was
eight months pregnant,

07:25.695 --> 07:29.105
we drove down to Boston to see
a production of <i>Anne Frank.</i>

07:29.515 --> 07:30.325
Just sort of hit her

07:30.449 --> 07:33.059
in some personal way
when she saw the play.

07:34.419 --> 07:36.291
I would say
that people sometimes

07:36.627 --> 07:38.996
remark that she resembled
Anne Frank.

07:39.956 --> 07:41.616
They were the same age.

07:42.274 --> 07:45.380
So, the tattoo

07:45.824 --> 07:47.066
on her arm...

07:48.502 --> 07:49.784
Charlotte?

07:52.613 --> 07:54.209
What the hell are you doing?

07:56.901 --> 07:59.592
And all of this happened
after a night in the theater?

07:59.814 --> 08:02.224
No. It all started
after we had the baby.

08:02.322 --> 08:03.943
She couldn't sleep
because of the crying.

08:04.059 --> 08:06.106
She said it made her
feel powerless.

08:06.227 --> 08:07.413
She began to turn a deaf ear,

08:07.531 --> 08:08.761
and then she began
leaving the house

08:08.940 --> 08:11.402
and going to a library
to read about Auschwitz.

08:11.590 --> 08:14.925
It's almost like
she wanted to relive it.

08:15.046 --> 08:18.451
That she somehow could
change the outcome.

08:18.605 --> 08:20.095
She'd go on about these babies

08:20.233 --> 08:21.302
who were gassed

08:21.461 --> 08:23.745
and tortured, and I'd ask her,

08:25.895 --> 08:28.335
"What about your own baby,
Charlotte?"

08:29.473 --> 08:30.908
He doesn't want me.
He wants you.

08:31.132 --> 08:32.700
- He wants his mother.
- I keep telling you,

08:32.817 --> 08:33.780
I can't help it!

08:34.011 --> 08:35.082
He's not the one

08:35.205 --> 08:36.691
who needs me.

08:37.493 --> 08:38.499
<i>She'd come home with bags</i>

08:38.642 --> 08:41.809
<i>full of old newspapers,</i>
<i>art supplies.</i>

08:46.155 --> 08:48.171
<i>She'd disappear into the den</i>

08:48.877 --> 08:50.798
<i>to work on her project.</i>

09:05.341 --> 09:06.777
Sounds to me
like a classic case

09:06.905 --> 09:08.611
of postpartum psychosis.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.127
How long have you
been standing there,

09:10.441 --> 09:11.895
Dr. Butt-in-ski?

09:12.011 --> 09:13.929
Long enough to make a
pretty good diagnosis.

09:14.055 --> 09:16.103
The obsession, the manic
behavior, the disconnection

09:16.218 --> 09:17.265
from her baby.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.017
My wife isn't a psychotic.

09:20.115 --> 09:22.027
She's a very emotional person.

09:22.184 --> 09:24.061
She needs to come home.

09:24.173 --> 09:25.255
I think that's dangerous.

09:25.455 --> 09:27.041
Did you hear what he said?

09:27.426 --> 09:29.933
The man wants his wife at home.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.049
They made me change my clothes,
Sister Jude.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.319
Why do I have to wear
this uncomfortable dress?

09:44.433 --> 09:45.763
I don't care for it anymore.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.533
It'll help make the
transition easier.

09:48.844 --> 09:49.800
You're letting me go?

09:49.926 --> 09:51.083
Charlotte?

09:51.974 --> 09:53.255
My God, Charlotte.

09:53.575 --> 09:54.804
I've been looking for you.

09:55.378 --> 09:56.940
My name is Anne.

09:57.157 --> 09:58.181
Charlotte,

09:58.305 --> 09:59.476
it's time to come home.

10:01.463 --> 10:02.938
Stay away from me.

10:03.096 --> 10:05.172
My name is Anne Frank.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.646
I'm a death camp survivor.

10:07.735 --> 10:10.355
You're my wife and the
mother of our baby.

10:10.656 --> 10:13.402
Now, please stop this
and come home with me.

10:13.502 --> 10:14.872
No! You don't know me.

10:15.021 --> 10:17.507
Sister Jude,
you have to help me.

10:17.609 --> 10:18.958
I'm helping you, Charlotte.

10:19.149 --> 10:20.727
I'm trying to reunite you

10:20.908 --> 10:22.170
with your family.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.732
What about Grouper?
His crimes against humanity?

10:24.848 --> 10:26.088
No, no, go home.

10:26.270 --> 10:27.404
Go home.

10:36.839 --> 10:38.339
It can't be.

10:42.021 --> 10:43.431
David needs you.

10:47.350 --> 10:48.918
My baby?

10:49.687 --> 10:51.052
I need you.

10:54.336 --> 10:55.970
Everything's going
to be all right.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.062
Okay? You'll see.

11:10.343 --> 11:11.548
You're making a mistake.

11:11.847 --> 11:13.635
Forget about it, Doctor.

11:13.755 --> 11:15.423
It's none of
our concern anymore.

11:15.534 --> 11:16.789
Kit Walker is my concern.

11:16.891 --> 11:19.312
What's this barbaric rumor
I hear about sterilization?

11:19.421 --> 11:21.579
- It's not a rumor.
- You're not a doctor.

11:21.703 --> 11:23.298
You have no right
to authorize medical procedures

11:23.431 --> 11:24.962
without their consent.

11:33.456 --> 11:34.750
Are you afraid?

11:39.663 --> 11:40.813
No.

11:41.873 --> 11:43.327
I don't believe you.

11:49.313 --> 11:51.288
Alma and I always wanted kids.

11:52.661 --> 11:54.892
We always talked
about having two or three.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.665
Always tomorrow.

12:00.616 --> 12:02.607
And now there will be
no tomorrow.

12:04.146 --> 12:06.016
For either of us.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.288
I'm so sorry.

12:09.179 --> 12:11.248
I got us into this mess.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.453
No. I don't regret
what we did.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.927
There's no one to blame
except Sister Jude.

12:20.236 --> 12:22.047
I think she's the devil.

12:41.624 --> 12:42.977
Now?

12:43.587 --> 12:44.737
Yes.

12:45.214 --> 12:47.039
If you hurry, you might
be able to have supper.

12:47.156 --> 12:48.491
Supper?

12:49.181 --> 12:51.248
I thought you were taking me
for the operation.

12:51.368 --> 12:52.653
No, Kit.

12:52.764 --> 12:54.627
Sister Jude changed her mind.

12:54.885 --> 12:56.023
She said you showed signs

12:56.174 --> 12:57.963
of true redemption.

12:58.252 --> 13:00.699
You're being released
from solitary.

13:01.049 --> 13:02.322
Yay.

13:02.838 --> 13:04.218
What about Grace?

13:04.437 --> 13:06.186
Oh, I haven't forgotten
about her.

13:17.602 --> 13:18.757
I can't believe
you'll hear me say this,

13:18.882 --> 13:21.130
but I actually miss
the food from the kitchen.

13:21.239 --> 13:22.935
Oh, you won't be eating tonight.

13:23.148 --> 13:23.982
No food for

13:24.099 --> 13:25.918
12 hours before the procedure.

13:26.057 --> 13:27.630
You said Sister Jude
changed her mind.

13:27.738 --> 13:30.311
For Kit. Rest up, dear.

13:30.745 --> 13:32.028
You're going under the knife
in the morning.

13:32.139 --> 13:32.998
You'll need your strength.

13:33.155 --> 13:35.433
No. No, you can't do that!

13:36.377 --> 13:37.796
Let me out!

13:38.338 --> 13:40.021
Come back! Let me out!

13:40.304 --> 13:41.635
Let me out!

13:41.788 --> 13:43.980
Let me out! Someone!

15:08.740 --> 15:10.341
We're leaving
right after dinner.

15:11.196 --> 15:13.543
Meet me by the
front staircase at 6:00.

15:14.325 --> 15:15.778
Is this real?

15:17.631 --> 15:19.192
Don't be late.

15:43.378 --> 15:45.039
Kit.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

15:45.159 --> 15:46.281
Doc, you got to help Grace.

15:46.460 --> 15:47.674
Jude's going to sterilize her.

15:47.993 --> 15:50.872
- It's not right.
- Grace isn't my patient, Kit.

15:51.727 --> 15:52.841
You are.

15:53.418 --> 15:56.245
So, why don't we
just concentrate on you...

15:58.759 --> 16:00.604
...and then I'll see
what I can do for Grace.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.869
Deal?

16:03.441 --> 16:06.020
Have you given thought
to what we discussed last time?

16:06.372 --> 16:08.354
You want me to say I killed Alma
and those other ladies.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.861
Only if you believe it's true.

16:11.447 --> 16:12.492
You need to give yourself

16:12.627 --> 16:14.449
permission to remember.

16:14.839 --> 16:17.740
I think one way to do that
is to hear it in your own words.

16:18.725 --> 16:21.748
I want you to describe
what you think happened.

16:22.263 --> 16:23.506
Then I'll play it back for you

16:23.663 --> 16:24.895
so you can hear it
in your own voice,

16:25.016 --> 16:26.852
- with your own ears.
- And if I do that,

16:27.001 --> 16:28.077
you're going to tell the courts

16:28.228 --> 16:29.449
that I should...
that I should stay here,

16:29.561 --> 16:31.224
and I-I won't go
to the chair?

16:31.322 --> 16:34.583
Yes. That is the bargain.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.923
But I need to feel
you're sincere.

16:48.631 --> 16:50.368
My name is Kit Walker.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.457
And I murdered my wife.

17:03.639 --> 17:05.073
Don't fight it.

17:06.707 --> 17:08.223
It'll only make it worse.

17:08.363 --> 17:09.512
Who is it?

17:10.059 --> 17:12.330
What are you?
My name is Alma.

17:33.333 --> 17:36.168
Can you take down
a message for Mr. Goodman?

17:36.779 --> 17:38.841
Goodman. Tell him...

17:38.977 --> 17:42.836
it was all a mistake and that
he should just go back home.

17:42.950 --> 17:44.812
I gave him
the wrong information.

17:45.092 --> 17:48.678
No, the wrong information.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.898
Thanks.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.865
What information was that?

17:58.337 --> 18:00.119
It's not important.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.362
It sounded to me
as if there was some

18:03.707 --> 18:06.935
juicy little tidbit
stuck in your craw.

18:07.914 --> 18:09.965
Oh, come on, Sister,
spit it up.

18:10.111 --> 18:12.444
- You'll feel better.
- How's your leg?

18:12.871 --> 18:13.970
Please.

18:14.130 --> 18:16.517
Let's dispense
with the small talk, shall we?

18:16.626 --> 18:19.244
You and I both know that,
during my absence,

18:19.368 --> 18:22.021
you finally got a chance
to stick your nose in my lab.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.797
A patient made a complaint.

18:23.913 --> 18:26.725
I was obliged to follow up.

18:26.954 --> 18:27.865
And?

18:28.001 --> 18:29.892
It wasn't all that interesting.

18:32.398 --> 18:33.704
I see.

18:35.772 --> 18:36.966
Do you mind?

18:41.592 --> 18:42.778
You should probably know

18:42.889 --> 18:45.291
that I plan
on pressing charges.

18:46.191 --> 18:47.780
To what end?

18:47.906 --> 18:49.345
She's a confused young woman.

18:49.448 --> 18:50.724
No, not her.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.700
You. On your watch,

18:52.808 --> 18:54.850
that crazy bitch got
a hold of a loaded gun,

18:54.973 --> 18:58.204
and you sent her home without
so much as a slap on the wrist.

18:58.967 --> 19:01.522
Your ineptitude is staggering.

19:01.634 --> 19:06.890
Dr. Arden...
I know, in the past,

19:07.262 --> 19:09.175
you and I have had
our differences,

19:09.295 --> 19:11.585
and you're certainly
entitled to a...

19:11.724 --> 19:13.417
a sense of safety here.

19:13.559 --> 19:16.272
I hope, perhaps you and
I can start afresh.

19:16.419 --> 19:18.448
Is that your idea
of an apology?

19:19.837 --> 19:22.013
Is that what you're
looking for-- an apology?

19:22.109 --> 19:23.396
No.

19:23.522 --> 19:25.430
I'd prefer you grovel.

19:25.559 --> 19:27.252
I think I'm entitled to it.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.977
Perhaps if you prostrated
yourself on the floor

19:30.128 --> 19:32.059
and begged my forgiveness.

19:32.925 --> 19:34.131
No?

19:35.083 --> 19:38.350
Barring that,
I have no other option

19:38.523 --> 19:42.403
but to call the monsignor
and demand your dismissal.

19:48.141 --> 19:50.045
You're through here, Sister.

19:51.184 --> 19:53.012
And you know it.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.857
Let me do that.

20:16.564 --> 20:17.705
Sister!

20:18.330 --> 20:20.612
- I didn't hear you.
- Now, now.

20:21.038 --> 20:22.174
It's all right, Arthur.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.127
You've nothing
to be ashamed of.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.852
All the nuns here have had
some training as nurses. Sit.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.220
I've been meaning
to speak to you.

20:41.656 --> 20:43.341
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior

20:43.465 --> 20:44.387
the night of the storm.

20:44.499 --> 20:47.826
It was... untoward.

20:48.830 --> 20:49.977
What do you say we chalk it up

20:50.104 --> 20:54.344
to the barometric pressure
and never speak of it again?

20:55.809 --> 20:57.772
I know what you did, Sister.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.795
Thank you for protecting me.

21:02.581 --> 21:04.330
Protecting us.

21:04.858 --> 21:06.502
<i>Even though I don't</i>
<i>fully understand your work,</i>

21:07.112 --> 21:09.204
<i>I feel I've been</i>
<i>an important part of it.</i>

21:10.076 --> 21:12.130
<i>And so you have, my cherub.</i>

21:16.967 --> 21:18.155
You'll be free
to continue that work

21:18.265 --> 21:20.452
once Sister Jude
has been turned out.

21:20.978 --> 21:22.519
The monsignor
will put you in charge,

21:22.700 --> 21:25.874
and you'll need
a strong right hand.

21:26.111 --> 21:27.882
Someone you can trust.

21:28.465 --> 21:30.195
I trust you...

21:31.128 --> 21:32.718
completely.

21:34.212 --> 21:35.246
And I'm very impressed

21:35.378 --> 21:36.388
that you managed to get her out

21:36.512 --> 21:38.375
and into the woods
all on your own.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.247
You'd be surprised.

21:40.547 --> 21:42.148
She weighed very little.

21:51.254 --> 21:53.902
Mikey Curtis,
no monkey business!

22:20.686 --> 22:22.677
Peggy Cartwright,
what on earth is the matter?

22:22.796 --> 22:24.679
There's a monster!

23:46.786 --> 23:48.594
Well, well, well.

23:49.141 --> 23:51.251
Look what the cat dragged in.

23:51.966 --> 23:54.571
That didn't take very
long now, did it?

23:54.966 --> 23:56.640
Stay away from me.

23:57.108 --> 24:00.083
Not so tough without your gun.

24:03.004 --> 24:04.419
You didn't give it
much of a chance.

24:04.541 --> 24:07.621
I have to go to work.
I'm afraid to leave her alone.

24:07.733 --> 24:09.371
It's a period of adjustment.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.325
I mean, you said yourself,
a baby needs its mother.

24:12.434 --> 24:15.322
A normal mother, yes!
Charlotte's not normal!

24:17.366 --> 24:18.940
She's worse.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.682
<i>At least before,</i>
<i>she could tune out the crying.</i>

24:21.802 --> 24:23.213
Charlotte?

24:23.890 --> 24:25.398
Do you want to hold your baby?

24:29.772 --> 24:32.708
Yes, darling,
why don't I do that?!

24:40.201 --> 24:41.516
Hey, stop it!

24:45.462 --> 24:46.826
Are you insane?!

24:48.799 --> 24:50.902
I thought if I brought her home,
she spent time with us,

24:51.035 --> 24:54.058
she'd remember who she was,
see how much we need her.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.695
Please, Sister.

24:58.203 --> 25:00.456
You have to take her.
I can't handle her.

25:00.566 --> 25:04.277
Isn't there some family
that could stay with her?

25:04.410 --> 25:08.352
She needs professional help,
the care of a good doctor.

25:08.464 --> 25:10.705
Like the doctor that came
in here and diagnosed her.

25:11.423 --> 25:13.657
He seemed to understand
what she needed.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.186
Dr. Thredson?

25:15.767 --> 25:18.801
You're welcome to consult with
him if that's what you want.

25:20.504 --> 25:21.887
Frank?

25:23.914 --> 25:27.186
Find Dr. Thredson,
send him here.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.632
Are you ready?

25:43.748 --> 25:45.263
What's the plan?
How do we do this?

25:46.002 --> 25:47.159
We'll walk out the door,

25:47.742 --> 25:48.736
we'll walk straight to my car.

25:48.864 --> 25:49.914
Do you understand?

25:50.156 --> 25:52.133
What do you mean?
How do we get past the guard?

25:52.295 --> 25:55.017
Like I said, walk.

26:05.423 --> 26:06.708
Night, Jimmy.

26:08.922 --> 26:10.387
Dr. Thredson!

26:21.866 --> 26:24.007
Excuse me.
What were you...?

26:26.236 --> 26:27.247
Dr. Arden?

26:27.361 --> 26:28.736
That's right.

26:29.771 --> 26:32.295
Oh, my God. You're the...

26:32.421 --> 26:33.967
you're the man my wife shot.

26:35.586 --> 26:37.594
Thank you for not
pressing charges.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.510
She doesn't know
what she was doing.

26:39.791 --> 26:40.971
She's out of her mind.

26:41.376 --> 26:44.223
Yes, I'm aware
of that, Mr. Brown.

26:44.328 --> 26:45.777
But you needn't worry.

26:45.917 --> 26:48.709
I see no reason
for punitive action.

26:48.957 --> 26:51.572
Not when there's a far more
humane remedy at hand.

26:51.689 --> 26:53.930
As a matter of fact,
we could do it tonight.

26:54.048 --> 26:57.852
Then she'll be home
by tomorrow, a new woman.

27:11.009 --> 27:12.263
Dr. Thredson!

27:12.838 --> 27:14.913
Dr. Thredson, Sister
Jude is asking for you.

27:15.021 --> 27:17.584
Anne Frank, or whoever she is,

27:17.710 --> 27:18.930
her husband brought her back.

27:22.738 --> 27:24.227
I don't work here
anymore, Frank.

27:26.288 --> 27:28.408
As a matter of fact,
I never did.

27:31.038 --> 27:32.920
You can tell her I said that.

27:53.722 --> 27:55.627
Are you sure that this is safe?

27:56.382 --> 27:59.256
Not only safe,
but highly effective.

27:59.374 --> 28:02.015
In my hands,
the transorbital lobotomy

28:02.226 --> 28:03.904
has become as routine as...

28:05.428 --> 28:06.972
filling a cavity.

28:07.639 --> 28:09.739
Holy apostle, Saint Jude,
faithful servant

28:09.885 --> 28:13.909
and friend of Jesus,
the patron of hopeless cases

28:14.024 --> 28:15.611
and things almost despaired of,

28:15.699 --> 28:18.288
pray for me,
who am so miserable.

28:18.444 --> 28:21.656
Make use, I implore thee,
of the particular privilege

28:21.801 --> 28:25.657
that is accorded to thee,
to bring visible and speedy help

28:25.788 --> 28:28.112
where help was almost
despaired of.

28:31.543 --> 28:35.768
Um, bad news.
We searched everywhere.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.805
Lana Winters
is nowhere to be found.

28:38.005 --> 28:40.628
I'm certain she's off grounds,
Sister.

28:47.615 --> 28:49.152
You know, when I was a child,

28:49.404 --> 28:53.048
I'd come home after school
to an empty house.

28:53.798 --> 28:55.273
My father had flown the coop,

28:55.382 --> 28:58.139
and my mother worked
as a maid in a hotel.

29:00.285 --> 29:02.008
It was lonely,

29:02.752 --> 29:07.594
so I brought in
a baby squirrel I'd found,

29:07.902 --> 29:10.027
and kept him in a shoebox.

29:11.707 --> 29:14.007
And then, one day,
when I came home,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.881
he looked sickly.

29:19.819 --> 29:22.793
He was dead already,
but I didn't know that.

29:23.889 --> 29:25.909
I'd forgotten to...

29:27.661 --> 29:31.778
feed him for a couple days.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.813
So I took him out of the box
and I laid him on the table

29:38.300 --> 29:41.634
and I prayed my heart out

29:42.906 --> 29:44.627
for several hours.

29:46.771 --> 29:48.910
And when my mother came home
and found us,

29:49.031 --> 29:50.142
she screamed bloody murder.

29:50.260 --> 29:52.735
She picked him up
and threw him in the garbage.

29:56.894 --> 29:59.253
She worked hard, my mother.

30:00.502 --> 30:03.520
She was exhausted,
and she couldn't have known

30:03.725 --> 30:06.101
how cruel that was.

30:08.273 --> 30:11.555
But I cried and cried, saying,

30:12.737 --> 30:15.519
"God didn't answer my prayers!"

30:21.425 --> 30:22.888
I remember...

30:25.504 --> 30:29.531
my mother was pouring herself
a whiskey;

30:30.759 --> 30:33.587
the Martin family cure
for everything.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.923
She looked at me and laughed.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.388
"God always answers
our prayers, Judy.

30:44.814 --> 30:46.601
It's just rarely...

30:49.505 --> 30:51.904
the answer we're looking for."

30:56.434 --> 30:58.706
It's over for me, Frank.

31:01.858 --> 31:03.713
My goose is cooked.

31:03.826 --> 31:06.165
I certainly hope
you're not blaming yourself.

31:06.569 --> 31:08.814
Men are never gonna accept
a woman taking charge,

31:09.286 --> 31:11.794
especially not a woman
as strong as you are.

31:11.992 --> 31:14.669
In my opinion,
you never really had a chance.

32:21.225 --> 32:23.123
What's your poison, sweetheart?

32:47.325 --> 32:48.886
Make yourself at home.

32:50.662 --> 32:54.170
- Dr. Thredson?
- Oliver.

32:54.492 --> 32:57.164
I really appreciate
everything you've done, but...

32:57.491 --> 32:59.563
I think I want
to go to my house.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.612
Lana, once they discover
you missing,

33:02.730 --> 33:04.807
the first place
they'll look is there.

33:05.281 --> 33:07.637
You're much safer here--
at least for the night.

33:08.065 --> 33:09.850
First thing in the morning,
we go to the police.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.059
I already have an appointment
set up with Detective Spears.

33:12.180 --> 33:13.574
I trust him implicitly.

33:13.779 --> 33:14.726
We present the evidence,

33:14.849 --> 33:16.549
together we shut down
Briarcliff.

33:19.101 --> 33:21.748
Relax. That place
is behind you.

33:21.861 --> 33:24.717
Please, come in. Have a seat.

33:24.824 --> 33:27.249
You've had an incredibly
stressful day.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.005
I'm going to prescribe a little
something to take the edge off.

33:30.118 --> 33:32.049
I-I don't want any medicine.

33:33.099 --> 33:35.678
A big, delicious glass of wine.

33:35.795 --> 33:37.419
Well, that doesn't sound
half bad.

33:37.535 --> 33:38.434
White or red?

33:38.537 --> 33:39.626
Red.

34:15.647 --> 34:17.389
No calls.

34:18.781 --> 34:19.540
I was trying to get a hold

34:19.659 --> 34:20.916
of my friend Lois--
she might have heard

34:21.030 --> 34:21.911
something about Wendy.

34:22.025 --> 34:23.286
Lana, you have to realize

34:23.405 --> 34:25.331
that I am at risk as well here.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.812
I broke you out
of a mental institution.

34:27.922 --> 34:30.202
I can't afford to let
anyone know where you are.

34:30.348 --> 34:32.186
Not until we go
public tomorrow.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.206
You're gonna write about this.

34:43.591 --> 34:45.411
You're gonna win
a Pulitzer Prize.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.938
I just know it, Lana.

34:48.369 --> 34:50.841
You are the person
to tell my story.

34:52.598 --> 34:54.476
<i>Your</i> story?

35:01.145 --> 35:03.652
Here's to taking down
Briarcliff.

35:04.846 --> 35:06.521
Hear, hear.

35:28.165 --> 35:29.667
Mint?

35:38.786 --> 35:41.055
Boy...

35:41.188 --> 35:45.964
That wine, um,
went straight to my head.

35:47.238 --> 35:49.564
Would you mind
if I used your restroom?

35:49.693 --> 35:51.156
Sure.

35:51.272 --> 35:52.652
It's right down the hall.

35:54.237 --> 35:55.512
Thank you.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.473
I think I made a wrong turn.

36:34.595 --> 36:36.357
I see you found my little...

36:36.483 --> 36:37.672
hobby.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.770
You make furniture?

36:46.217 --> 36:47.896
Lamps mainly.

36:48.591 --> 36:50.472
I make the shades myself.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.047
Really?

36:53.215 --> 36:55.550
What kind of material
do you use?

36:56.393 --> 36:57.923
Skin.

37:11.634 --> 37:12.946
Grace?

37:13.059 --> 37:14.253
When'd you get...

37:14.609 --> 37:15.958
Oh, God.

37:16.998 --> 37:18.702
Hey, we need a doctor!

37:19.840 --> 37:21.917
Those bastards-- I can't believe
they actually did it.

37:22.088 --> 37:23.735
Dr. Thredson, he promised me
this wasn't going to happen.

37:23.837 --> 37:26.559
Kit Walker, you're under arrest
for the murder of Donna Burton,

37:26.791 --> 37:29.380
Alison Riedel and Alma Walker.

37:29.902 --> 37:31.185
- Wait.
- Where's Thredson?

37:31.316 --> 37:33.006
You guys need
to talk to Dr. Thredson.

37:33.136 --> 37:34.593
- No, we don't.
- It's a mistake.

37:34.734 --> 37:37.161
We got his evaluation
and your taped confession.

37:37.282 --> 37:39.582
- Come on, Kit. Let's go.
- No, he didn't do it.

37:39.723 --> 37:40.726
She's alive.

37:40.833 --> 37:43.111
- What?
- Everything you said is true.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.424
For Christ sakes,
let me talk to her!

37:45.545 --> 37:46.665
I saw her!

37:47.561 --> 37:48.884
Alma's alive.

37:49.911 --> 37:51.568
I saw her!

38:09.763 --> 38:11.703
Hello?

38:12.602 --> 38:14.883
Hello?!

38:24.485 --> 38:25.633
Wendy.

38:26.060 --> 38:27.435
Oh, my God.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.043
Wendy...

38:31.382 --> 38:32.263
Wendy.

38:33.369 --> 38:35.191
Wendy!

38:43.992 --> 38:45.927
She's been on ice for a while.

38:48.791 --> 38:50.421
I was hoping she'd be
a little more pliable

38:50.543 --> 38:52.025
by the time you came to.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.590
What's happening?

38:54.376 --> 38:56.755
What did you do to her?!

38:57.296 --> 38:58.778
Kept her fresh.

39:03.066 --> 39:05.282
Normally, by now, I would've...

39:06.963 --> 39:08.611
removed the skin.

39:16.094 --> 39:17.691
And head.

39:19.377 --> 39:20.519
No, we need to keep her around

39:20.636 --> 39:23.048
a little longer
for our purposes.

39:25.327 --> 39:27.932
We're going to continue
our therapy now, Lana.

39:34.129 --> 39:36.026
You can begin...

39:36.941 --> 39:39.543
by kissing her cold lips.

39:41.589 --> 39:43.190
Don't worry.

39:43.702 --> 39:45.312
She won't bite.

39:51.364 --> 39:52.625
I took her teeth.

39:54.751 --> 39:56.358

With carrots,
potatoes and onions.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.255
Well, I'm gonna make a martini.

Don't be silly--
I can make that for you.

40:57.348 --> 40:59.147

41:02.878 --> 41:04.335
Is that trash?

41:06.262 --> 41:08.279
- I can take this.
- That would be swell.

41:08.974 --> 41:12.307
You seem happy, sweetheart.
Are you as happy as you look?

41:16.154 --> 41:18.400
