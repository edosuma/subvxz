00:48.920 --> 00:51.880
[distant gunfire, explosions]

00:53.000 --> 00:55.160
[ominous music]

00:56.320 --> 00:59.760
[running feet, panting]

00:59.840 --> 01:01.760
[huffing]

01:08.160 --> 01:10.000
Fire!

01:10.960 --> 01:12.480
[metallic rattling]

01:13.080 --> 01:14.080
[grunts]

01:17.640 --> 01:18.720
[soldier] On your left!

01:20.040 --> 01:21.360
[soldier] You! Look sharp!

01:23.240 --> 01:26.560
-[gasping]
-[soldier] Remember, Cadia stands, always!

01:27.920 --> 01:30.120
[Narl] Have you stabilised
the south eastern trenches?

01:30.880 --> 01:33.320
Yes, sir. Shored up just as you ordered.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.720
Very good.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.360
And the las-battery emplacements
to the east?

01:38.320 --> 01:39.560
Re-supplied, sir.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.440
The eastern line won't buckle.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.720
-[gasps]
-Now, Prado, I need...

01:47.440 --> 01:48.600
[groans]

01:52.160 --> 01:53.160
[noise of disgust]

01:59.600 --> 02:01.120
Get up, soldier!

02:01.360 --> 02:03.280
No wallowing in the filth.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.120
Everyone here stands.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.960
[sighs] Yes, sir!

02:08.040 --> 02:10.440
Futro sent you from High Command.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.840
The alien's hive mind
is interfering with communications.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.480
The vox is down.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.640
Yes, sir.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.000
You have a message?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.320
More of a question, sir.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.120
[distant roar]

02:23.240 --> 02:24.760
Well, spit it out, then.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.000
Can't you hear?

02:26.080 --> 02:28.280
The enemy are about to try their luck.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.360
[sighs, grunts]

02:33.960 --> 02:35.920
[ominous music]

[chittering stops]

02:49.200 --> 02:50.640
[screeching]

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
Open fire!

02:55.560 --> 02:56.720
Help!

02:57.640 --> 02:58.800
Die!

03:03.760 --> 03:04.760

03:39.080 --> 03:40.960
[distant gunfire]

03:44.080 --> 03:45.080
Medic!

03:45.440 --> 03:47.160
Harlan! With me!

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
Sir!

03:50.280 --> 03:52.080
-[Eoin groans]
-Keep this one alive.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.480
Get him back to command
to deliver my reply.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.640
[gasps]

03:57.280 --> 03:58.960
Consider it done, sir.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.880
Cadia stands, sergeant.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.680
Cadia stands, sir.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.240
You! Move those corpses.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.760
Form a barricade.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.960
You want to make this easy for them?

04:12.120 --> 04:13.200
[Narl] For Emperor's sake!

04:14.160 --> 04:15.240
Cadia stands?

04:15.840 --> 04:16.920
Forgive me.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.800
I thought, well...

04:19.520 --> 04:21.160
Wasn't your whole planet destroyed?

04:22.120 --> 04:23.320
It was.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.120
[Harlan] The arch-enemy came
with overwhelming force

04:27.280 --> 04:28.720
and vile sorcery,

04:28.800 --> 04:30.960
and broke our world to pieces.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.320
They destroyed the ground we walked on,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.000
but Cadia is more than that.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.720
Cadia is us.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.840
Cadia is everywhere now.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.880
[gasping]

04:46.000 --> 04:48.200
But I'm just a messenger.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.720
Everyone here stands.

04:54.920 --> 04:55.920
[gasps]

04:57.240 --> 05:00.040
[distant explosions]

05:07.600 --> 05:08.640

[screaming]

05:13.040 --> 05:14.440
[gasping]

05:14.520 --> 05:16.320
[soldier] Cadia stands!

05:16.400 --> 05:17.720
Kill them!

05:21.040 --> 05:22.200
[screams]

05:23.840 --> 05:26.960

06:12.880 --> 06:13.960
But...

06:14.440 --> 06:15.640
you...

06:16.720 --> 06:18.280
I did what any one of us would do.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.920
What he would have done for me.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.440

[wind howling]

08:41.840 --> 08:44.280
[distant war sounds]

08:47.320 --> 08:48.320
Tread carefully.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.240
Some of them might still be alive.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.320
They're all dead.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.240
I wasn't talking about anything human.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.320
There's... There's so many.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.320
Keep moving.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.240
I never knew...

09:08.960 --> 09:11.280
This is the truth of war.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.480
[soldier panting]

09:13.720 --> 09:14.920
[soldier gasping]

09:16.240 --> 09:17.720
Harlan! Over here!

09:18.040 --> 09:19.320
There's someone alive in there.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.120
[straining]

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
Help me!

09:29.600 --> 09:30.800
We need to keep moving.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.360
This section of the trench
could be overrun at any moment.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.240
We can't just leave him.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.040
We can't take him with us.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.000
We can get him to a medic.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.520
[gasping]

09:45.920 --> 09:47.240
[soldier] My gun.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.480
My gun.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.080
[pained breathing]

09:57.960 --> 09:59.600
How could anyone have survived this?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.600
No... You're not...

10:12.320 --> 10:13.440
My gun!

10:14.520 --> 10:15.640
Take it easy.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.320
We're going to get you some help.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.760
[coughing]

10:27.360 --> 10:28.440
Harlan, please!

10:29.080 --> 10:30.440
We can't just leave him.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.840
This is your trench line, soldier.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.760
Help me get him up to the firing step.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.240
There's no way!

10:46.320 --> 10:47.480
[Harlan] You wanted to help him.

10:47.640 --> 10:48.760
So help him.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.680
He can't hold this line.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.080
While he has breath in his lungs
and a gun in his hands,

10:58.160 --> 10:59.720
his duty is not done.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.400
Cadia stands.

The Casadorian 7th
are holding to the West.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.840
As are the Miren 9th.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.880
Well? Do you have a reply?

14:56.440 --> 14:57.440
Yes, sir.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.240
[distant explosions]

15:05.480 --> 15:08.440
[Futro] What did she say?
Will the Cadian lines hold?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.920
Well,
they did lose their own world after all.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.960
She says they'll stand.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.520
[Futro] Is there a difference?

15:18.200 --> 15:19.440
[Eoin] Yes.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.040
There's a difference.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.280
Cadia is all of us now.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.200
Cadia stands.
