00:06.790 --> 00:07.870
2004

00:10.380 --> 00:15.033
FBI FIELD OFFICE
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA

00:28.420 --> 00:29.990
We've got you, Ms. Garcia.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.956
If you say so, suit.

00:34.170 --> 00:35.706
We've got evidence
of your off-site servers

00:35.710 --> 00:37.496
and of your hack into
the cosmetics company.

00:40.580 --> 00:41.911
They test on animals.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.490
Yes. But it's not illegal.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.821
What you've done is a felony
and it's punishable by prison.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.319
Well, you've got me, J. Edgar...

00:49.330 --> 00:50.615
It's Agent Hotchner,

00:50.620 --> 00:52.201
and I'm from the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.036
And I'm here to offer you
an option to prison.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.878
You come work_ for me.
You'd be our technical analyst.

00:59.460 --> 01:04.204
So, I teach you how to use Google,
that kind of thing? That's fun.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.110
You'd help us hunt psychopaths.

01:08.330 --> 01:09.957
I'm a psychopath.

01:10.830 --> 01:12.115
No, you're not.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.036
In hacker circles you're known
as the Black Queen.

01:15.330 --> 01:16.820
And you are rigorously moral.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.702
All of your online
attacks reflect a fierce desire

01:19.710 --> 01:21.666
to protect those who you think
are being hurt.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.820
If you accept my offer,
you can do the same thing

01:23.830 --> 01:25.570
for the federal government.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.162
I just need a resume
to give to human resources.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.076
Or we prosecute you.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.992
Well, I'm not in the habit
of bringing my resume

01:36.000 --> 01:37.911
to events I am handcuffed at,

01:37.920 --> 01:39.490
but I have some stationery in my purse

01:39.500 --> 01:42.412
and I'll write down some computer stuff
I know and think about it.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.492
I took out her phone and laptop.
Everything else is harmless.

01:56.210 --> 01:57.370
Hotchner.

01:58.420 --> 02:01.287
We'll be right there. We have a suspect.

02:01.290 --> 02:02.530
I need an answer.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.872
Yes, ifI can keep my purse.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.496
Good choice.

02:12.170 --> 02:13.614
-Do you have a key?

02:20.330 --> 02:21.376
Oh.

02:21.790 --> 02:23.371
Beauty and brains.

02:28.420 --> 02:29.910
Hey, Eyebrows.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.076
When they do the Men of the FBI calendar,

02:33.080 --> 02:34.820
is it just 12 months of you?

02:37.750 --> 02:39.286
Welcome to the team.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.825
TO DAY

02:46.830 --> 02:49.116
So, let's talk about
sexual harassment.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.200
BAU HEADQUARTERS
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

02:50.210 --> 02:53.202
Sexual harassment isn't always
a quid pro quo arrangement.

02:53.670 --> 02:56.241
Maybe it's a conversation
between two co-workers

02:56.250 --> 02:58.320
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.879
Maybe these co-workers use phrases like,

03:02.290 --> 03:03.780
"Baby girl."

03:04.290 --> 03:06.201
"Chocolate thunder."

03:06.540 --> 03:10.419
Or, "Where's my big black twelve-pack?"

03:10.790 --> 03:12.075
Who blabbed?

03:12.080 --> 03:13.957
And that creates a what?

03:15.500 --> 03:18.572
A hostile work environment.

03:18.580 --> 03:22.698
So messages like,
"More cushion for the pushing"...

03:23.460 --> 03:24.870
-Not app_ropriate.

03:25.580 --> 03:30.370
"I'll be Coco to your Ice-T."
Not appropriate.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.281
"Flarpy blunderguff."

03:35.670 --> 03:38.616
-I don't even know_what that means...

03:38.620 --> 03:40.918
But not appropriate.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.411
Ms. Garcia, you really
have to stay for this.

03:43.420 --> 03:46.287
I'm sorry, but I got...
I... I have to... I'm so sorry.

03:46.290 --> 03:47.666
I'm so sorry.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.319
I'm so... I'm so, so sorry.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.286
Not appropriate.

03:53.460 --> 03:57.703
Oh, sir, I am so, so, so sorry about this.

03:57.710 --> 03:59.029
Take a look at this.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.951
- -Is this real

04:03.960 --> 04:06.611
Yes. And we're on our way to the
Attorney General's office to explain it.

04:06.620 --> 04:09.874
Uh, when you say "we,"
you mean the whole team or...

04:09.880 --> 04:11.245
I mean you and me.

04:11.580 --> 04:12.615
Oh.

04:15.710 --> 04:16.745
Oh.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.708
In 2004, the BAU flew
to San Jose for two reasons.

04:22.710 --> 04:23.995
One was to recruit Garcia,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.740
the other was to arrest
this man, Sam Russell.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.990
The prostitute killer.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.956
Eight victims.
He didn't fit the profile exactly,

04:28.960 --> 04:31.246
but he waived his rights
and admitted to all eight.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.411
Isn't San Quentin putting him
to death in two weeks?

04:33.420 --> 04:35.570
Yes. And we've been tasked
to reVIew his conVIctIon.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.992
-Why us

04:38.000 --> 04:39.490
Okay, uh, this morning,

04:39.500 --> 04:42.378
the Justice Department website was hacked.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.952
When you log on,
you see this and then this.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.872
Are those crime scene
photos of the Victims?

04:48.880 --> 04:50.529
The San Jose Police Department
was also hacked.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.371
Garcia says this must have been
months in the planning.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.166
Any idea who's behind it?

04:54.170 --> 04:57.378
Best guess is it's an online collective
known as Star Chamber.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.996
They're one of several justice-oriented
groups that sprung up

05:00.000 --> 05:02.821
in the wake of the Steubenville rape case.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.991
Star Chamber. Interesting name.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.116
It's derived from a 17th-century
British court

05:07.120 --> 05:08.610
designed to ensure
fair enforcement of laws

05:08.620 --> 05:09.826
against the rich and the powerful.

05:09.830 --> 05:10.990
Actually, according to my research,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.991
they named it that
because it's also the name

05:13.000 --> 05:16.492
of a mediocre yet awesome
Michael Douglas movie from 1983.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.458
Okay, but why Sam Russell?
He confessed without any coercion.

05:19.460 --> 05:23.783
Because in addition to being a monster,
Sam Russell is a hacker extraordinaire.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.418
I don't know the man,
but I learned from him.

05:26.420 --> 05:29.457
So, the Star Chamber
is rallying behind one of their own

05:29.460 --> 05:31.451
before the State of California
can put him to death.

05:31.460 --> 05:35.282
And we get thrown the political football
to make the negative attention go away.

05:35.290 --> 05:36.996
We have to separate ourselves
from the politics of it

05:37.000 --> 05:39.036
and ensure that they're
executing the right man.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.741
"People often say
that this or that person

06:18.750 --> 06:20.456
"has not yet found himself.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.576
"But the self is not something one finds,

06:22.580 --> 06:24.571
"it is something one creates."

06:24.580 --> 06:26.161
Thomas Szasz.

06:28.830 --> 06:31.879
Well, looking at the history
of Star Chamber, they love riddles.

06:31.880 --> 06:36.169
So this message, "They died in vein,"
spelled V-E-I-N,

06:36.170 --> 06:38.786
that's not just a homonymic mistake,
it's a clue.

06:38.790 --> 06:41.111
Yeah. That's their game.
"We know something you don't."

06:41.120 --> 06:43.372
They're fiercely libertarian
and anti-secrecy,

06:43.380 --> 06:45.371
which goes hand-in-hand
with conspiracy theorizing.

06:45.380 --> 06:46.529
As far as they're concerned,

06:46.540 --> 06:48.167
the whole Sam Russell thing is a cover-up.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.616
Why did we close in on Russell
as a suspect?

06:50.620 --> 06:52.781
He was arrested repeatedly
for solicitation.

06:52.790 --> 06:55.918
All streetwalkers, all drug addicts.
His victims match that type.

06:56.330 --> 06:59.914
Well, you said he didn't fit the profile.
It sounds like he ﬁt it perfectly.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.376
There was an issue with M0.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.575
Four of the prostitutes were stabbed
and four were strangled,

07:03.580 --> 07:05.070
and the UnSub alternated between kills.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.490
It sounds like two UnSubs.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.877
That was our profile until Russell
confessed to everything,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.667
including names and details.
As far as we could tell, it was just him.

07:11.670 --> 07:13.160
Yeah, but we can't that that for granted.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.780
Dave, Blake, and Reid,
go over the old files.

07:15.790 --> 07:18.372
We need to re-interview everyone
associated with the case.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.200
Morgan and Garcia, dig into Star Chamber.

07:20.210 --> 07:22.496
We don't want to validate them,
but we need to know what they know.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.786
And JJ and I will go to San Quentin.

07:31.080 --> 07:35.289
SAN QUENTIN PENITENTIARY

07:47.710 --> 07:50.326
Agent Hotchner, thank you for coming.

07:50.330 --> 07:52.537
-This is Agent Jareau.
-Hi. Good to meet you.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.496
Have a seat.

07:55.460 --> 07:57.325
Are those prayer beads?

07:57.330 --> 07:59.821
Uh, yes. I don't go anywhere without them.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.530
They're bound with hair?

08:04.790 --> 08:09.204
Well, uh, I exist on death row,
Agent Jareau. Hair is all I have left.

08:09.210 --> 08:11.872
And these beads,
they help me accept my fate

08:11.880 --> 08:15.202
that I'm gonna be murdered for crimes
I did not commit.

08:15.210 --> 08:18.077
This prison's filled
with men who didn't do it.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.160
Why should we believe you?

08:20.420 --> 08:21.910
Have you heard of desoxyn?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.070
It's a pharmaceutical-grade
methamphetamine

08:25.080 --> 08:27.537
used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.168
and when I started popping those pills
like candy, I was gone.

08:38.170 --> 08:41.879
I would just hack in 100-hour stretches.
I'd sleep for four.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.495
I was an addict.

08:44.790 --> 08:45.870
Not a killer.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.953
So you're saying desoxyn caused you
to sign a confession to eight murders?

08:48.960 --> 08:50.245
Yes.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.615
Look, here's something you don't know.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.997
The man who arrested me,
Detective Bob Cooper,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.911
he found my pills
and then he introduced me

08:55.920 --> 08:57.740
to the good stuff, the IV stuff.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.571
And the more prostitutes
I confessed to killing,

09:00.580 --> 09:04.243
based on information that he fed me,
the higher the dose.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.877
And I never fully sobered up
until last year

09:05.880 --> 09:08.451
when I discovered Buddhism,
but by then it was too late.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.529
No one would listen.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.496
But the Star Chamber did.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.708
That's their whole message, right

09:17.620 --> 09:19.030
How are you communicating with them?

09:20.290 --> 09:21.416
I'm not gonna tell you that.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.911
I'm not gonna let you interfere with work
they're doing on my behalf.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.821
Odd behavior from
a supposedly innocent man.

09:26.830 --> 09:30.539
You know what? I've howled for 10 years

09:30.540 --> 09:32.610
against a system
that wouldn't even notice me

09:32.620 --> 09:35.077
until the Star Chamber embarrassed them,

09:35.080 --> 09:36.377
and then it noticed.

09:36.380 --> 09:39.110
I'm not gonna cooperate and help you
find the Star Chamber.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.610
They're the only ones
fighting to keep me alive.

09:45.080 --> 09:48.572
So, how long ago did
you retire, Detective?

09:48.580 --> 09:51.287
Oh, about four years.

09:51.290 --> 09:54.498
You know, they say that you never
turn off being a cop,

09:54.500 --> 09:55.569
but I sure did.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.748
Detective Cooper,
we need to ask you a few questions

09:58.750 --> 10:00.115
about the Sam Russell case.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.452
Oh, my pleasure, yeah.
It's good to answer questions

10:02.460 --> 10:05.611
that are gonna put this guy
in the gas chamber

10:05.620 --> 10:07.030
instead of taking him out.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.747
Someone claims that you fed Russell drugs

10:09.750 --> 10:11.456
in order to get the confession.

10:11.460 --> 10:14.247
Who

10:14.250 --> 10:15.569
It doesn't matter who.

10:15.580 --> 10:20.028
Oh, I bet it was those jackass
computer nerds.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.611
-Is it true?
-No, of course not.

10:24.170 --> 10:27.458
I'd be willing to swear
on a stack of bibles if you want me to.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.700
It's not true.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.826
You know, it's interesting how much
you can tell about a person

10:30.830 --> 10:31.990
by what they choose to read.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.377
This shelf, for instance,
is devoted to Ayn Rand,

10:34.380 --> 10:37.531
Christopher Hitchens,
Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris.

10:38.790 --> 10:41.031
-So?
-You're an atheist.

10:41.040 --> 10:45.409
And your comment about
the stack of bibles is a linguistic tell.

10:45.420 --> 10:48.412
You're overcompensating,
which means you're hiding something.

10:49.460 --> 10:50.779
I...

10:50.790 --> 10:53.418
That photograph you were admiring there...

10:53.420 --> 10:55.411
You want to know who
I'm shaking hands with?

10:55.420 --> 10:56.819
Well, I'll tell you.

10:56.830 --> 11:00.072
It's my union rep, local 151.
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.616
When you people leave here,

11:01.620 --> 11:03.872
I'm gonna get on the phone
with my good buddy there

11:03.880 --> 11:08.078
and he's going to issue a press release
saying that detective Bob Cooper

11:08.080 --> 11:11.789
has devoted his entire career to justice.

11:11.790 --> 11:17.069
So why is the FBI keeping a serial killer

11:17.080 --> 11:18.570
who he caught

11:20.000 --> 11:22.912
from receiving the justice
that the brotherhood of police

11:22.920 --> 11:26.378
fight and die for every day?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.826
I can't tell you how much
we need your help.

11:34.830 --> 11:37.492
Your network security is tight.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.242
It has to be. We're in hacker central
here in Silicon Valley.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.458
We ramped up after we digitized
all our case files, but whoever did this

11:43.460 --> 11:44.996
-left a bomb behind.
-A bomb?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.319
He means a Trojan horse,

11:46.330 --> 11:49.037
so whenever you try to source the hack,
pieces of the code self-delete,

11:49.040 --> 11:52.373
which means the Star Chamber has
pretty much all of the Sam Russell ﬁle.

11:52.380 --> 11:54.280
You've seen this before?
Because it took our backup file

11:54.290 --> 11:55.575
and the District Attorney's.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.162
Yeah, I may have helped design this
back when I was a sort of bad guy.

11:59.170 --> 12:00.740
But I'm gonna see
what I can do to rebuild it.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.701
-Let me know if you need any help.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:06.790 --> 12:11.568
Yeah, I am not rebuilding jack.
Whoever did that is amazing.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.070
Come on, not as amazing as you.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.038
Pretty amazing. And he started with
an SQL injection. That's no big deal.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.280
You could download
a patch to fight it off,

12:17.290 --> 12:20.202
but it's the patch that contains
the Trojan horse.

12:20.210 --> 12:21.575
Like taking a flu shot filled with cancer.

12:21.580 --> 12:22.569
Exactly.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.288
Maybe I could find a clue in the code
to figure out who the culprit is.

12:26.290 --> 12:28.076
Just do that thing that you do, baby girl.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.953
-Okay. We have to stop this.
-Stop what?

12:33.620 --> 12:36.373
Derek, the FBI is organizing seminars
on the way we talk.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.871
_ -So what? _
-So it's embarrassmg.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.917
Not to me. I am not about to change
how I am with you

12:41.920 --> 12:44.070
because Bob in payroll
doesn't get the joke.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.536
Look, I like the way we talk.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.201
Just can we cool it for a bit, please?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.410
Fine.

12:52.420 --> 12:53.990
Only because you're asking.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.911
However, before we play
this little game of yours,

12:55.920 --> 12:58.377
I want to know what
this blunderguff thing is.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.450
That is a conversation

13:00.460 --> 13:01.996
-between JJ and I that I will...

13:03.290 --> 13:06.111
VVhat

13:06.540 --> 13:07.825
- -What?

13:07.830 --> 13:08.956
I have to talk to Hotch.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.495
This is the client's address?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.161
Yeah, this is it.

13:18.170 --> 13:20.877
-Huh. Homey.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.822
Whenever a guy books
a two-fer, you have to wonder.

13:24.830 --> 13:29.779
Not me. I tell the sitter I'll be home
early, because they book us for all night

13:29.790 --> 13:32.782
and then we're out the door
after 15 minutes.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.746
20, tops.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.279
Welcome.

13:55.790 --> 13:58.782
Okay. We need to have
a little primer on hacking.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.951
Because I think I've figured out
the member of the Star Chamber

14:00.960 --> 14:03.326
-who's behind all this.
-And who is he?

14:03.330 --> 14:05.161
I'm gonna take a guess
based on the signature.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.706
Hackers have signatures?

14:06.710 --> 14:09.372
Sometimes. Usually it's a message
in the code

14:09.380 --> 14:11.109
to let other pros know,
"Hey, this one was me."

14:11.120 --> 14:14.669
And in this case,
the signature matches the DOJ hack,

14:14.670 --> 14:16.786
and it is, "Happy Fun Meow Meow."

14:19.040 --> 14:20.826
Sorry, what?

14:20.830 --> 14:22.786
"Happy Fun Meow Meow."

14:23.290 --> 14:24.826
What the hell does that mean?

14:24.830 --> 14:27.287
It was Garcia's signature before
she joined the BAU.

14:27.290 --> 14:28.951
None of this has been an accident.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.827
Getting us to review the case,
leaving that clue,

14:31.830 --> 14:34.572
and there is only one man old enough

14:34.580 --> 14:37.242
and has the kind of crazy
kung fu to do it.

14:38.750 --> 14:42.493
His name is Shane Wyeth,
and he is my old...

14:42.920 --> 14:44.160
Hacking mentor.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.876
Do you think you can get him
to come to the table?

14:45.880 --> 14:48.030
We need the file to reexamine
Russell's confe55ion.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.951
If Russell's innocent,
we'll need it for clues

14:49.960 --> 14:51.530
to find the identity of the real killer.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.703
That's not gonna be easy.
Shane and I ended on terrible terms.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.166
He was more than just a mentor, wasn't he?

15:18.670 --> 15:21.161
Please, let me go.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.990
Please...

15:24.960 --> 15:26.370
Uh-uh-uh.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.326
Dont.No”.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.415
I'm sorry.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.660
I'm so sorry.

15:41.330 --> 15:43.787
Hold my... Hold my hand.

16:08.420 --> 16:10.376
My lawyer told me
the news this morning.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.951
Two more prostitutes.
One stabbed, one strangled.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.166
It's a tragedy.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.115
A tragedy that helps your case.

16:18.790 --> 16:20.530
I need to talk to Shane Wyeth.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.247
He's the member of the Star Chamber
you've been in contact With, correct?

16:24.330 --> 16:27.037
That depends. Are you gonna arrest him?

16:27.750 --> 16:28.876
No.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.451
How can I trust that?

16:32.620 --> 16:34.281
Because I don't think you did this.

16:34.290 --> 16:37.282
And I need the file
that he stole in order to prove it.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.740
So how do I contact him?

16:42.670 --> 16:46.492
Shane will speak with the Black Queen.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.701
The Black Queen only.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.287
They set up an Internet Relay Chat room,

16:51.290 --> 16:53.952
and from there they can arrange
a meeting on neutral turf.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.497
There are millions of IRC channels.
I need a name.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.110
Hashtag hail to the king.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.706
You really think he's innocent?

17:18.710 --> 17:21.452
I know he's hiding something,
but I couldn't let him know that.

17:21.460 --> 17:24.372
Okay, we got what we needed.
How do we play it to our advantage?

17:24.920 --> 17:27.036
We don't. We can't.

17:27.290 --> 17:28.496
We do this Shane's way.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.951
No, Garcia, it's too early
to make that call.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.918
Sir, I'm not happy about any of this,
but people are still dying, right?

17:35.920 --> 17:38.206
All right, you arrange the meet
and we'll deliver the profile.

17:43.420 --> 17:46.241
At this point we've got
two working theories about this case.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.206
We need to give both of them equal weight

17:48.210 --> 17:51.611
The first is that,
unpleasant as it may be to admit,

17:51.620 --> 17:55.454
Sam Russell was wrongly convicted
and the real killer has struck again.

17:55.460 --> 17:58.247
If that's the case,
this UnSub is controlled enough

17:58.250 --> 17:59.956
to stay dormant for 10 years.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.327
But Russell's impending execution
has brought him back to the surface.

18:03.330 --> 18:06.379
Dennis Rader, the BTK killer,
went dormant for 16 years

18:06.380 --> 18:09.201
but later sent letters to the_ media
claiming credit for his crimes.

18:09.210 --> 18:12.498
And last night's murder could serve
as a similar message to us.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.070
The other theory is we have a copycat

18:14.080 --> 18:16.321
and he's trying to cast doubt
on Russell's conviction.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.740
To copy the case this accurately,

18:17.750 --> 18:20.787
the UnSub would have to have access
to the original case file.

18:20.790 --> 18:23.327
And since the Star Chamber
has that file,

18:23.330 --> 18:24.706
we think he's one of their members.

18:24.710 --> 18:28.248
Certain types of hackers
thrive on the cachet of infamy.

18:28.250 --> 18:31.037
This UnSub wants to show
his peers that he's so evil

18:31.040 --> 18:32.951
he can commit the murders
that Russell didn't.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.780
And whichever of these theories
turns out to be correct,

18:34.790 --> 18:37.918
the key to ﬁnding this UnSub is
comparing last night's murder to 2004.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.036
How are you gonna do that
when we don't have the file anymore?

18:40.040 --> 18:41.780
We have an expert working on it right now.

18:42.170 --> 18:43.819
Testing.

18:43.830 --> 18:45.786
Okay, keep going.
I want to test the signal.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.286
Tell me about the meet.

18:47.290 --> 18:50.418
Uh, it's happening at a local access
network gaming center.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.376
It's a good place for hackers to hide.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.240
All right, that's good.

18:55.620 --> 18:58.168
-I feel like I'm gonna barf.
-Okay, hey. Hey, hey.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.286
If you get in trouble,
I will be on you before you...

19:06.880 --> 19:08.279
I will be there.

19:13.460 --> 19:14.495
Wow.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.319
You were gonna marry this guy,
weren't you?

19:17.920 --> 19:19.160
No.

19:19.170 --> 19:20.819
-No,no.
-No?

19:20.830 --> 19:22.377
Okay, then what?

19:22.380 --> 19:24.450
Because _I have never
seen you like this before.

19:24.880 --> 19:25.915
Oh...

19:32.540 --> 19:35.577
After my parents died,
I went through this period

19:35.580 --> 19:37.787
where I was even more
comfortable than I am now

19:37.790 --> 19:41.203
in front of a computer
than in front of people.

19:41.670 --> 19:44.616
You know, a computer can't surprise you

19:44.620 --> 19:47.703
or hurt you or die without saying goodbye.

19:47.710 --> 19:49.371
And...

19:50.880 --> 19:53.826
Shane figured that out about me
and he made me feel really...

19:53.830 --> 19:55.036
Safe?

19:55.040 --> 19:58.112
Yes. And he did it by telling me
I was never going to die.

19:59.330 --> 20:03.039
He recorded almost everything
I said and I did.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.707
That's kind of romantic, I guess.

20:08.710 --> 20:10.996
I guess. Until you get in a fight.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.321
And then it's like, "Would you please
put down the freakin' camera

20:13.330 --> 20:15.821
_ "and can we talk
like normal people, and..."

20:15.830 --> 20:17.707
-You know, I'm stubborn.
-Oh, yeah. Just a little bit.

20:17.710 --> 20:20.326
No, but it was like we'd get...
We would get in these fights.

20:20.330 --> 20:21.877
And... And then...

20:23.250 --> 20:27.289
He liked fighting. A lot.
He liked winning.

20:29.380 --> 20:35.535
And I had become this person
that I never intended to be.

20:36.580 --> 20:37.911
So I stopped being that person,

20:37.920 --> 20:40.662
and when I stopped being that person,
I couldn't be with Shane.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.319
And I never looked back.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.989
Good.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.035
Because you've come a long way.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.320
It's time.

20:55.330 --> 20:56.706
Time for what?

20:57.460 --> 20:59.496
Isn't it obvious, eyebrows?

21:01.080 --> 21:03.036
I have to get into character.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.032
Shane? Shane!

21:13.540 --> 21:15.997
-What?
-I need another hour, Shane.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.821
-No.
-Come on. Comp me 15 minutes.

21:18.830 --> 21:21.788
Did you learn nothing
from your date with your sister?

21:21.790 --> 21:22.950
No means no.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.918
Now, either give me
your mom's credit card or get out.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.820
Hey, Shane.
-What's up?

21:27.830 --> 21:29.570
What the hell, man?
We just got knocked offline.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.615
What do you mean?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.207
Oh!

21:38.000 --> 21:39.570
What is going on?

21:39.580 --> 21:40.660
She's back.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.240
Very nice.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.876
- -Wow.

22:07.580 --> 22:08.820
You...

22:09.710 --> 22:10.779
You've lost weight.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.371
You miss me?

22:17.170 --> 22:18.569
No.

22:21.330 --> 22:22.570
Okay.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.616
Why don't you...

22:26.330 --> 22:27.490
Prove it?

22:38.170 --> 22:39.535
Hi.

22:40.290 --> 22:41.871
Hi.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.166
I'm going to kiss you.

22:45.170 --> 22:46.910
Okay.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.371
Thank you.

23:05.380 --> 23:06.415
Uh...

23:10.670 --> 23:12.240
We have a lot to talk about.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.416
Yes, we do.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.825
So, we dug into both victims' lives.

23:20.830 --> 23:23.958
They worked for separate agencies but
went freelance about two months ago.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.451
Not a surprise. We've seen how
the Internet has revolutionized

23:26.460 --> 23:28.030
the sex industry.
It's taken it off the streets

23:28.040 --> 23:29.667
and allowed the women
to control their own clientele.

23:29.670 --> 23:31.820
That could be how the UnSub
crossed paths with them.

23:31.830 --> 23:33.320
We thought that, too,
but when we looked

23:33.330 --> 23:36.163
at cell and computer records,
the data fields were empty.

23:36.170 --> 23:37.535
For both women?

23:37.540 --> 23:39.997
Well, if it was just one,
we'd chalk it up to chance or luck,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.285
but two's a pattern.

23:41.290 --> 23:42.530
And if the UnSub's good with computers,

23:42.540 --> 23:43.746
he could have erased everything.

23:43.750 --> 23:46.321
We need to dig deeper
into their online lives,

23:46.330 --> 23:48.036
match his expertise with our own.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.372
Well, unfortunately,
our expertise is in the field right now.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.609
Just give us the file back.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.612
You're asking me
to cooperate with the FBI.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.206
I am asking you to do the right thing.

23:59.210 --> 24:02.532
This is not about proving
whether Russell is innocent, okay?

24:03.420 --> 24:05.456
Look, two more women died last night...

24:05.460 --> 24:07.166
Yeah, I know. 'Cause of that,

24:07.170 --> 24:09.206
I should hand the keys
to the car back to the morons

24:09.210 --> 24:11.075
who crashed it in the first place?

24:11.080 --> 24:13.617
I took the file to make you
rebuild the case from scratch

24:13.620 --> 24:14.917
because you and the genius squad

24:14.920 --> 24:16.990
missed a couple kind of important things.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.115
Like the silent partner.

24:19.710 --> 24:22.076
-You have no idea who that is, do you

24:22.080 --> 24:23.786
Your team floated two killers.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.746
There's been an inside man the whole time.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.911
You completely overlooked him.
You're the FBI, for God's sake.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.320
Can we stop

24:30.330 --> 24:32.491
Can we just talk like normal people
for a second?

24:33.420 --> 24:37.538
Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, let's talk like normal people.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.490
How's your mom?

24:44.960 --> 24:47.702
She died. Seven years ago.

24:48.170 --> 24:49.285
I'm so sorry.

24:49.830 --> 24:51.161
I posted a thing.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.416
I can't...

24:56.790 --> 24:58.075
I made a deal with the FBI.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.378
I'm not allowed to get in touch with you,
with guys like you.

25:00.380 --> 25:02.996
Why did you do it

25:04.420 --> 25:08.038
-I got caught.
-You got caught? You walked in.

25:09.750 --> 25:12.287
You walked in 'cause you were
too scared to stay with me.

25:13.460 --> 25:16.031
I wanted a different life, maybe.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.207
Well, you got one, didn't you?

25:19.420 --> 25:20.569
Baby girl.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.456
You don't even know
what that means.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.745
I know the texts I saw.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.572
And whoever this guys is,
the one I assume you're sleeping with,

25:30.580 --> 25:33.413
he did the impossible.
He managed to take the strongest,

25:33.420 --> 25:36.878
toughest woman I've ever met in my life
and he infantilized her.

25:38.210 --> 25:39.746
We're not sleeping together.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.878
Well, that makes it worse.
That means you infantilized yourself.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.370
Who are you?

25:45.380 --> 25:47.245
'Cause the woman I loved...

25:49.880 --> 25:51.108
She's gone.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.569
Some wine.

26:04.580 --> 26:06.411
I am good. Thanks.

26:06.830 --> 26:08.457
Can I use your bathroom?

26:09.210 --> 26:12.327
Sure. Down the hall to the left.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.247
What are you doing? No. No, no, no...

26:30.170 --> 26:31.205
No!

26:37.420 --> 26:38.569
And the MO was mixed?

26:38.580 --> 26:40.707
Only one victim, but he strangled her
and then stabbed her.

26:40.710 --> 26:41.995
It could be an evolution.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.956
Or he's trying to cast
more doubt on Russell.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.168
Her name is Debbie Bloom.
She went freelance two months ago,

26:47.170 --> 26:49.616
and when she did,
all traces of her business vanished.

26:49.620 --> 26:51.281
Exactly like the previous two victims.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.826
What if we're thinking about the MO wrong?

26:52.830 --> 26:54.115
What if the UnSub didn't erase the data,

26:54.120 --> 26:56.998
but the call girls were simply hiding it
from law enforcement?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.786
And the UnSub figured out
a way to use it to his advantage?

26:59.040 --> 27:01.702
Well, Blake found one potential lead.

27:02.330 --> 27:05.242
It was the last client that Debbie kept
before she went off the grid.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.956
Goes by the name of Mr. Smith.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.706
Will Mr. Smith talk to us?

27:08.710 --> 27:11.668
Well, once Blake promised
that we wouldn't ruin his marriage.

27:11.670 --> 27:13.114
She's bringing him in now.

27:22.330 --> 27:23.376
Who's that?

27:24.620 --> 27:25.666
Mr. Smith.

27:26.620 --> 27:27.700
Oh...

27:29.710 --> 27:31.029
It's so unfair.

27:31.670 --> 27:34.878
Going off the grid was supposed
to make things safer for her.

27:36.170 --> 27:38.786
The man we're looking for
knew she was off the grid

27:38.790 --> 27:40.326
and it's keeping us from finding him.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.456
Can you help us figure this out?

27:43.790 --> 27:46.372
I actually helped her set it up.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.410
There's apps now.

27:49.420 --> 27:52.617
Online calendars, phone calls over wi-fi,

27:52.620 --> 27:55.248
even payment through
this thing called Bitcoin,

27:55.250 --> 27:57.536
where you can have it converted into cash.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.373
But don't those still leave
breadcrumbs on the Internet?

28:00.830 --> 28:02.411
It was all encrypted.

28:02.420 --> 28:05.912
If she didn't log in every 12 hours,
all the data erases itself.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.286
So it couldn't be used against her
if she got arrested.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.877
So how did you figure all this out?

28:12.170 --> 28:13.876
Debbie found a post online.

28:13.880 --> 28:17.111
Um, we looked at it so much
I bookmarked it.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.667
Can I see?

28:19.290 --> 28:22.327
It's one of those long posts
with step-by-step instructions.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.707
If this is how Debbie hid in plain sight,

28:25.710 --> 28:28.247
it's a good bet that
Gloria and Marguerite did, too.

28:28.250 --> 28:31.162
Maybe the UnSub wrote that
in order to prey on his victims.

28:31.170 --> 28:33.320
The UnSub didn't write it.

28:33.330 --> 28:36.493
Based on the verbiage, syntax,
and organizational structure,

28:36.500 --> 28:38.377
I can tell you who did.

28:39.580 --> 28:40.786
Sam Russell.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.030
Come on.

28:45.830 --> 28:47.570
Take the cheese.

28:49.330 --> 28:50.740
What's going on?

28:50.750 --> 28:52.490
I was sick of being behind the eight ball,

28:52.500 --> 28:56.288
so I found a backdoor
on Shane's work server.

28:59.830 --> 29:01.377
Looks like he found you.

29:01.380 --> 29:02.870
That's the point.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.279
I wanted him to find me.

29:05.960 --> 29:11.409
And now, I invite him in
and we start to play.

29:14.790 --> 29:18.612
You found a blind spot.
I'm impressed.

29:19.790 --> 29:20.996
Why are we here?

29:21.580 --> 29:23.286
When we would fight...

29:24.670 --> 29:26.069
This is how we made up.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.379
So, figure, since this is the best way
we communicated,

29:29.380 --> 29:31.575
maybe I can use it
to talk some sense into you.

29:31.580 --> 29:33.161
Yeah, actually,

29:33.170 --> 29:36.242
I think this was the best way
we communicated.

29:40.670 --> 29:43.912
Remember? I do.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.959
I remember when you talking sense
sounded like this.

29:47.960 --> 29:53.455
There is zero point in following the law,
because the whole thing is corrupt.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.320
And nothing is going to make me happier

29:56.330 --> 30:01.074
than to watch the whole stupid thing
burn to the ground.

30:01.080 --> 30:06.700
The government, the police,
the feds, every shred of it.

30:06.710 --> 30:10.248
Burn, burn, burn.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.701
How's that, baby

30:15.210 --> 30:17.747
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
-Calm down.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.570
-You saw that.
-Yes, I did.

30:19.580 --> 30:21.912
-He's just trying to get under your skin.
-It's working.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.115
Forget about what he's doing
and focus on why.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.280
He's a narcissist, right?

30:27.250 --> 30:28.615
He's a game player.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.247
Garcia, those guys are easy to manipulate

30:30.250 --> 30:31.956
because they always overplay their hand.

30:32.210 --> 30:34.451
No. Not Shane. Shane does not lose.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.911
He lost something 10 years ago, didn't he?

30:37.960 --> 30:41.248
He doesn't care about Russell, Garcia.
He wants you.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.827
He wants you to one last time
say that he won.

30:48.460 --> 30:51.452
Okay. If that's true,
how do I use that against him?

30:52.170 --> 30:54.741
Sit down. Come on.

30:58.580 --> 31:00.411
Just wait for his opening.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.912
You'll know it when you see it. Okay?

31:03.920 --> 31:06.206
-Yeah.
-You can do this.

31:07.670 --> 31:08.876
I can do this.

31:10.790 --> 31:12.246
I can do this.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.787
Okay, I'm really embarrassed. Good job.

31:16.380 --> 31:19.167
You embarrassed me.
That doesn't matter. Here's why.

31:19.830 --> 31:21.536
I grew up, sort of,

31:22.040 --> 31:26.079
and I figured out that the revolution
isn't going to come over a T-1 line.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.911
I have learned new tricks.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.412
Who'd you learn them from

31:32.170 --> 31:34.741
Derek, the FBI's organizing
seminars on the way we talk.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.877
_ -So? _
-So it's embarrassmg.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.747
Not to me. I'm not about
to change the way I am With you

31:39.750 --> 31:41.877
because Bob in payroll
doesn't get the joke.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.076
Look, I like the way we talk...

31:44.080 --> 31:46.036
You've been following me this whole time?

31:46.040 --> 31:50.033
Yep. You and Supervisory
Very Special Agent Derek Morgan.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.746
Are you surprised?

31:51.750 --> 31:54.492
But really, honey, you chose this guy?

31:54.500 --> 31:59.119
You chose a brainless,
metrosexual action figure?

32:01.290 --> 32:02.666
That's his opening.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.911
Yes, it is. Now tell me why.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.957
Because the last time he said he didn't
know who you were, but he does.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.417
He sees us having a relationship
that he doesn't get to have anymore

32:10.420 --> 32:11.739
and it's driving him crazy.

32:12.790 --> 32:14.496
I told him we're not sleeping together.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.070
It doesn't matter.

32:16.080 --> 32:19.208
His narcissistic brain won't accept
that we could ever be friends.

32:19.210 --> 32:21.417
So he thinks he can beat me by beating us?

32:21.670 --> 32:22.910
Mmm-hmm.

32:25.290 --> 32:26.996
So what's your next move, baby girl?

32:33.750 --> 32:35.160
New game.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.746
We see who can find the new killer first.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.115
But we do it on an equal playing field.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.374
Which means you give us
the Sam Russell file back

32:47.620 --> 32:49.201
and we give you our proﬁle.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.822
When I win, what do I get?

32:55.080 --> 32:59.039
When you log on to the DOJ website,

32:59.040 --> 33:00.996
there'll be a picture of me

33:01.000 --> 33:03.662
and Super Special Agent Derek Morgan...

33:03.960 --> 33:06.497
With shoes on our heads.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.167
He just left the table.

33:16.170 --> 33:18.786
-Did he take the bait?
-I don't know.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.417
What's the shoe on the head mean?

33:20.420 --> 33:22.115
Ah, it's an Internet thing.

33:23.790 --> 33:26.577
Hello. I've got mail.

33:28.670 --> 33:29.819
We got the file.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.280
You know, I hate to admit it,

33:35.290 --> 33:37.417
but the Star Chamber
did an impressive job.

33:37.420 --> 33:39.786
They took the police file and annotated
it with their own research.

33:39.790 --> 33:41.746
Is there any other evidence?
'Cause I'm not seeing anything.

33:41.750 --> 33:42.990
There's one thing we missed.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.821
Back in 2004,
Russell had a silent hacking partner

33:45.830 --> 33:48.913
in charge of money and infrastructure
who remained hidden in the shadows.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.740
They think the silent partner
committed the murders

33:50.750 --> 33:52.160
and let Russell take the fall for it.

33:52.170 --> 33:54.957
Two UnSubs would explain it.
We profiled that 10 years ago.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.246
What if the silent partner
was also the killing partner?

33:57.250 --> 33:58.615
Well, that would mean
that Russell admitted to

33:58.620 --> 34:00.076
four murders he didn't commit.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.911
Why not just cut a deal
and name the partner?

34:01.920 --> 34:03.785
Because he'd still get life in prison.

34:03.790 --> 34:05.417
It beats a death sentence.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.069
Not if you think you can beat the system,

34:07.080 --> 34:09.287
and hackers always think they can do that,

34:09.290 --> 34:11.167
especially if you had help
from the outside.

34:11.170 --> 34:13.286
Then that's why the partner surfaced now.

34:13.290 --> 34:15.827
This whole time we've been trying
to figure out which profile is right,

34:15.830 --> 34:18.162
the dormant killer or the copycat.
But the answer is both.

34:18.170 --> 34:19.410
Okay, but how do we prove it?

34:19.420 --> 34:21.115
If we can't, we're no better
than the Star Chamber.

34:24.420 --> 34:26.741
Yeah, Hotch.
I think we may have something.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.496
Yeah, I wrote this post.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.206
I told Shane to put it up on Reddit.

34:32.210 --> 34:35.111
Why would you care so much
about how prostitutes do business?

34:35.120 --> 34:37.702
Because I think sex work
should be safe and legal.

34:37.710 --> 34:39.371
The Internet can de-stigmatize it.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.917
And make it easier_ _
for predators to prey on Victims.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.878
Well, I agree. That's why you should
really catch that predator.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.199
There's something else
we need to discuss.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.246
When we got the files
back from the Star Chamber,

34:48.250 --> 34:51.822
we noticed a detail about the
strangulations we hadn't seen before.

34:51.830 --> 34:53.457
What we noticed about the killer

34:53.460 --> 34:56.281
is when he was choking out
these women, their hair...

34:56.710 --> 35:00.032
Their hair would collect
around their throats, like this.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.282
And he would grip it so tight

35:05.000 --> 35:07.412
he would rip the hair out by the roots.

35:10.670 --> 35:16.529
So, we realized the old killer's signature
that the new killer didn't copy

35:18.460 --> 35:19.779
was hair.

35:25.210 --> 35:28.168
Your partner on the outside
fed that to you,

35:28.170 --> 35:30.786
and every time you got
a lock of your victim's hair

35:30.790 --> 35:33.418
it was a promise that your plan
was still in motion

35:33.420 --> 35:34.660
and that he'd get you off.

35:34.670 --> 35:37.286
Well, instead, the two of you are going
to die in here together.

35:37.290 --> 35:38.780
Let me explain to you
what's going to happen.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.169
We're gonna go to the Governor
and he's going to halt your execution

35:43.170 --> 35:44.990
and withdraw the charges
for the first murders.

35:45.670 --> 35:47.706
And then we're going to retry
you for the other four murders.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.666
That's mine.
You gotta... Give it back.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.319
Give it back!

35:53.120 --> 35:54.667
Stop! It's mine!

35:56.420 --> 35:57.990
Come on.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.491
-It's ridiculous.
-What is?

36:00.500 --> 36:03.378
The FBI profile on the guy
Sam Russell's in prison for.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.740
How'd you hack that?

36:05.750 --> 36:07.160
I didn't.

36:07.710 --> 36:08.916
They gave it to me.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.319
-Rea|ly?
-Yeah.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.110
What's it say?

36:13.120 --> 36:15.497
Nothing. It's completely generic.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.879
All they've got is the guy could be
an underground hacker.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.575
Which could be any of us.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.070
That's good.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.320
Good?

36:23.330 --> 36:24.706
Yeah, good.

36:26.380 --> 36:27.916
Because they'll think it's you.

36:29.830 --> 36:31.161
What are you...

36:32.040 --> 36:33.075
Ooh...

36:38.210 --> 36:39.529
No...

36:57.670 --> 36:59.285
Clear.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.247
Yeah, Shane's car's here, he's not.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.706
All right. Garcia may have another lead.

37:07.710 --> 37:11.248
There's something hinky
about some stuff Shane bought online.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.162
There it is. Oxycodone.

37:14.170 --> 37:15.660
Would Shane use it recreationally?

37:15.670 --> 37:18.958
No way. Shane's one of those people
where like his body is his temple.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.780
He wouldn't take anything to pollute it.

37:20.790 --> 37:22.610
The UnSub must have
bought this in Shane's name.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.168
-Where were the drugs sent?
-To an address, in Shane's name,

37:25.170 --> 37:27.912
in Silicon Valley that there's no way
he could afford.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.820
All right, Morgan, go, take Reid with you.

37:29.830 --> 37:32.037
Garcia, I want you onsite,
too, scanning the networks.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.416
Yes, sir.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.917
Oh, God, you used me.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.569
Oh, Shane.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.166
You wanted to be used.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.610
You took my money

37:45.960 --> 37:49.248
and you hoarded my servers

37:49.250 --> 37:54.244
for your little crusade.

37:54.250 --> 37:58.459
And none of that is free.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.280
Even those women knew that.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.576
And so...

38:12.330 --> 38:18.109
Now it's time for you to be
so overwhelmed with guilt

38:18.120 --> 38:19.781
that you...

38:19.790 --> 38:21.326
Kill yourself.

38:23.250 --> 38:24.740
FBI!

38:24.750 --> 38:26.877
Drop the needle. Let me see your hands.

38:30.380 --> 38:32.917
How much did you give him?
-Figure it out.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.740
Stand down.
OFFICER: Standing down.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.667
Quick, pull up his shirt, Morgan.

39:05.380 --> 39:08.076
Nothing.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.162
Paramedics are on their way.
You got anything else over there?

39:10.170 --> 39:11.489
Maybe norepinephrine but
it might kill him.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.320
Wait. Just wait.

39:13.330 --> 39:17.664
Shane, I know you're in there
and I know you can hear me.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.577
Hey. I won, Shane.

39:21.580 --> 39:23.320
And if you die on me,

39:23.330 --> 39:27.915
I'm gonna tell everybody we know I won.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.490
Do it. Do it now.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.496
You got lucky.

39:59.790 --> 40:00.825
Oh...

40:02.250 --> 40:03.740
Yes, I did.

40:10.420 --> 40:12.320
This is the one. This is_the last...
Wait... No, wait.

40:12.330 --> 40:14.912
-No... That's the_one. That's the...

40:14.920 --> 40:17.741
Hold on. Okay, one more. I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm stopping.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.576
We used to make fun of chicks like you.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.992
No. You used to make fun
of chicks like me.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.030
This is who I always wanted to be

40:30.040 --> 40:33.248
and I was too afraid to tell you
because I didn't think you'd like me.

40:34.710 --> 40:36.166
Do you ever miss her?

40:39.830 --> 40:41.286
'Cause I do.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.412
Take such good care of yourself, Shane.

40:53.540 --> 40:54.780
Goodbye.

40:58.170 --> 40:59.614
Goodbye.

41:04.580 --> 41:08.573
So, I have a confession to make.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.035
Uh-oh.

41:11.290 --> 41:13.872
You are not the first guy
to call me "baby girl."

41:13.880 --> 41:16.576
-Get out of here.
-It's true.

41:17.460 --> 41:20.202
-It better not be that guy.
-Oh, no. Uh-uh.

41:20.210 --> 41:21.450
Actually, it was a different guy.

41:23.670 --> 41:25.410
Okay, I'll bite.

41:25.420 --> 41:29.072
How did this pretender to the throne
end up stealing my fire?

41:29.750 --> 41:32.321
I'm going to tell you, but first,

41:32.330 --> 41:38.417
I have to explain an explicit,
sexually inappropriate detail.

41:38.420 --> 41:41.457
What a flarpy blunderguff is.

41:41.460 --> 41:44.827
Okay. So, you need like an oil-based paint

41:44.830 --> 41:46.240
and some charcoal

41:46.250 --> 41:48.662
and some sort of food that you love,

41:48.670 --> 41:51.821
I mean love, because
you are gonna be with it...

41:51.830 --> 41:54.788
"To invent your
own life's meaning is not easy.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.917
"But it's still allowed.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.115
"And I think you'll be happier
for the trouble."

41:59.120 --> 42:00.451
Bill Watterson.
