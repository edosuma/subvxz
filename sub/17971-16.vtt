(chuckles)

00:41.241 --> 00:42.908
Cover that butt crack.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.243
Cover that belly.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.478
Cover something!

00:46.480 --> 00:49.114
(explosion)

00:49.749 --> 00:50.883
No, it's a
chemical fire--

00:50.885 --> 00:52.317
you can't use water.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.421
We'll have to neutralize it
with calcium and boron.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.158
(hissing, gurgling)

00:59.160 --> 01:00.926
(tinkling)

01:00.928 --> 01:02.895
By the way, that's edible.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.130
Help! Derek's choking!

01:05.865 --> 01:06.732
(gasping)

01:06.734 --> 01:09.134
It's not working!

01:12.639 --> 01:14.406
(pants, sighs weakly)

01:16.342 --> 01:17.276
(loud gasp)

01:17.278 --> 01:18.510
He can breathe!

01:18.512 --> 01:21.180
Ha! Mrs. Brown
just throated me.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.848
Ha. Ha.

01:23.616 --> 01:26.618
(grunting)

01:26.620 --> 01:28.787
What the Sam Hill
is going on in here?

01:28.789 --> 01:31.723
Oh, Donna, you're just in time
for the inaugural run

01:31.725 --> 01:35.427
of the Brown family's
Blizzard of Bucks Machine!

01:35.429 --> 01:37.162
(cheering)

01:37.164 --> 01:38.263
Yeah!

01:38.265 --> 01:39.398
Oh, hell, no.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.499
Shut it down.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.234
(machine powers down,
all groaning)

01:42.236 --> 01:43.735
Oh, man.
Come on, Donna.

01:43.737 --> 01:44.803
You can play, too.

01:44.805 --> 01:45.871
Cleveland, I
had a long day,

01:45.873 --> 01:47.973
(echoing): and I'm in
no mood for your nonsense.

01:47.975 --> 01:52.544
Well, I hope you're in the
mood for... cold, hard cash!

01:52.546 --> 01:55.447
(machine whirs;
all cheering, whooping)

01:57.450 --> 01:58.317
Come on, baby!

01:58.319 --> 02:00.919
Big money, money, money,
money, money, money!

02:00.921 --> 02:02.721
(camera clicks)

02:04.591 --> 02:05.924
(buzzer sounds)
Time's up.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.893
You didn't
get any bucks!

02:07.895 --> 02:10.062
Donna, you suck at
Blizzard of Bucks!

02:10.064 --> 02:11.697
Who paid
for this machine?

02:11.699 --> 02:14.766
Donna, it pays
for itself.

02:14.768 --> 02:15.934
Out! Everybody out!

02:15.936 --> 02:17.870
Adios.
We can take a clue.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.371
Nice boobs.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.374
So, you wear a wig.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.576
I haven't had time
to color my gray.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.878
(screaming)

02:25.880 --> 02:26.812
(music plays on TV)

02:26.814 --> 02:28.680
I'm Kim Kardashian.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.582
There's two things I know:

02:30.584 --> 02:32.584
(bleep) and jeans.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.921
And these are great
(bleep) jeans.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.356
Kardashians.

02:37.358 --> 02:37.856
The only jeans

02:37.858 --> 02:40.626
with my own patented
dual-zipper technology.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.693
Kardashians.

02:41.695 --> 02:42.828
Because I'm worth it.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.997
Outcall only,
no kissing on the mouth.

02:44.999 --> 02:45.864
Mom!

02:45.866 --> 02:48.300
I need $300
to buy a pair of trendy jeans!

02:48.302 --> 02:51.803
DONNA: Do I look like Richard
Branson, The Rebel Billionaire?

02:51.805 --> 02:52.971
You got money!

02:52.973 --> 02:54.106
Not that much!

02:54.108 --> 02:54.973
RALLO:
I do.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.210
I have $322 in
my piggy bank.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.279
How'd you get so much money?

03:00.281 --> 03:02.648
Because I know how to save.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.317
And I've lost a lot of teeth.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.252
And I still have my looks.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.921
You're starting to get saggy.

03:08.923 --> 03:09.821
And... (grunts)

03:09.823 --> 03:15.060
Rallo, this is not the time
of the month to piss me off!

03:15.062 --> 03:16.094
Time of the month?!

03:16.096 --> 03:17.663
What's she talkin' about?

03:17.665 --> 03:20.299
Dan cra chick
fro a pilla at me.

03:20.301 --> 03:24.303
Tryin' to eat my
dan chip. Shoot.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.307
She's making you
return the Blizzard?

03:28.309 --> 03:28.974
I guess we know

03:28.976 --> 03:32.411
who wears the male genitals
in your family.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.913
Oh, pul-eese Louise.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.882
Donna's not
the boss of me.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.952
Look, Cleveland, all
of us have bossy wives.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.553
Or mothers.
You got to just

03:41.555 --> 03:43.355
figure out a way
to deal with them.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.223
I happen to be blessed

03:44.225 --> 03:46.024
with a wife who's
morbidly obese.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.493
All I have to do is
go through a doorway,

03:48.495 --> 03:49.628
and I'm golden.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.330
Well, when Arianna
gets me angry,

03:51.332 --> 03:55.067
I just log on to message boards
of random topics,

03:55.069 --> 03:58.370
and I post awful
personal things about her.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.639
And I sign it "Tom the Bear,"

04:00.641 --> 04:02.774
so she could never
trace it back to me.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.576
Hmm. I need
to talk to Donna,

04:04.578 --> 04:06.612
and I'll have
to be firm with her,

04:06.614 --> 04:08.580
like I was
with that homeless man.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.082
Spare some change?

04:10.084 --> 04:12.451
No. I'm sorry.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.458
Little help?

04:21.527 --> 04:21.927
All right!

04:21.929 --> 04:26.965
I'm gonna go buy a tent
so I can sleep outside for fun!

04:28.801 --> 04:31.003
Yo, Ro, squat
or get off the pot!

04:31.005 --> 04:34.506
Rallo, I told you, this is
a difficult time for me!

04:34.508 --> 04:35.907
Leave me alone!

04:35.909 --> 04:36.808
(Roberta cries)

04:36.810 --> 04:37.909
Man just want to go to bed

04:37.911 --> 04:41.480
without his breath stankin'
all to be damned.

04:42.715 --> 04:46.018
Great. Now I got
to get a new toothbrush.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.988
Max-eye Pads?

04:51.457 --> 04:53.158
(screaming)

04:53.160 --> 04:56.361
The blood! The horror!

04:56.363 --> 04:58.630
Roberta's dying!

04:58.632 --> 05:01.366
(screaming)

05:03.002 --> 05:04.803
You know, I've been thinkin'.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.971
You sure are wonderful.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.408
Cleveland, you're not keeping
the stupid money storm game.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.609
Blizzard of Bucks.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.643
Donna, come on.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.512
There's nothing
to do at my house

05:13.514 --> 05:14.680
when the guys come over.

05:14.682 --> 05:18.817
Holt has a Pop-A-Shot,
Tim has table tennis,

05:18.819 --> 05:20.819
Lester has tetherball,

05:20.821 --> 05:22.020
and all I got is...

05:22.022 --> 05:23.555
Ooh, thank you kindly.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.623
...is marbles.

05:24.625 --> 05:28.393
And nobody plays marbles
anymore, Donna.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.928
Nobody.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.563
Oh, Cleveland,
that is not pink.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.864
You asked for pink.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.166
(snaps fingers)
Waiter!

05:34.168 --> 05:35.667
Is there a problem?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.636
My husband's steak
is the problem.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.403
He asked for it pink.

05:38.405 --> 05:41.306
I'm just going to cover it
in ketchup anyway.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.709
Cleveland, hush.
Pink.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.677
(sighs)

05:46.646 --> 05:50.749
Donna, if I were watching us
on TV right now, I would say,

05:50.751 --> 05:54.019
"That handsome gentleman's
wife is pushy.

05:54.021 --> 05:54.920
"And I'll bet you

05:54.922 --> 05:57.489
sometimes she embarrasses him
around his friends."

05:57.491 --> 06:01.193
Then I would continue watching,
in hopes that they would explain

06:01.195 --> 06:03.628
what happened
to that sad waiter's leg.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.565
Look, Cleveland, I was born
with my dial set to eight,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.033
but life cranked it up to ten.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.102
That's what happens
when you're a single mom

06:10.104 --> 06:11.103
for as long as I was.

06:11.105 --> 06:13.205
And there's no
dialing me down now!

06:13.207 --> 06:14.473
Where's that steak?!

06:14.475 --> 06:17.542
Donna, let's try
some role playing.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.944
I'm Cleveland roll.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.912
I have a reasonable request.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.948
I'm Donna roll.
I'm bossy,

06:22.950 --> 06:26.551
and you can't have
a Blizzard of Bucks machine.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.086
And I'm Esther roll.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.790
Oh, J.J.,
you'd better not join a gang!

06:31.792 --> 06:35.193
Oh, for God's sake, will you
stop your dippin' and dappin'

06:35.195 --> 06:37.028
if I let you keep
that stupid game?

06:37.030 --> 06:40.499
And go get some new money
to put in it tonight?!

06:40.501 --> 06:41.666
Yes, Cleveland.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.968
Thank you, Donna.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.036
Michael, where's Thelma?

06:45.038 --> 06:47.105
Run along, Bookman.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.141
James is dead?!

06:49.143 --> 06:52.277
Damn. Damn. Damn!

06:52.279 --> 06:53.545
Sorry this took so long.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.648
I don't move so quickly
since I lost my leg.

06:56.650 --> 07:00.519
To an infection that wasn't
covered by my insurance.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.486
Yes!

07:01.488 --> 07:03.655
This show delivers!

07:04.023 --> 07:05.023
Maybe you could
ask the guys

07:05.025 --> 07:07.159
to bring some
of <i>their</i> money, too.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.060
They never want to.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.463
(gun cocks)
(both gasping)

07:11.465 --> 07:12.597
I'll take that.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.231
Yes, you will.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.733
Enjoy your
evening, sir.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.301
And I'll take
your ring.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.669
My wedding ring?!

07:17.671 --> 07:19.604
The hell you will!

07:19.606 --> 07:20.338
Donna, no!

07:20.340 --> 07:22.941
Just give
him the ring!

07:22.943 --> 07:25.510
(whimpering)

07:28.114 --> 07:30.649
CLEVELAND:
Ow!

07:31.584 --> 07:32.918
(grunts)

07:33.586 --> 07:35.554
Don't die, baby.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.623
God don't want you yet!

07:38.625 --> 07:43.061
Damn. Damn. Damn!

07:46.933 --> 07:49.901
Oh, Cleveland, thank God you
were only shot in the arm.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.804
Two minutes ago, it really
seemed like you were dead.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.638
Don't worry, Daddy.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.741
I'm gonna bathe you
and feed you and wipe you,

07:56.743 --> 07:59.711
just like you did me
when I was a baby.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.712
Thank you, Junior.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.181
Don't let him do any
of those things to me, Donna.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.716
Junior, could you
give us a minute?

08:04.718 --> 08:06.218
Sure. I'll hit
the maternity ward

08:06.220 --> 08:09.855
and look at the chicken people
in the incubators.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.856
Look at you, all shot up

08:10.858 --> 08:13.158
'cause I couldn't
keep my mouth shut.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.093
I'm so sorry, Cleveland.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.127
You were right about me.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.896
But I'm done being
the old Donna.

08:17.898 --> 08:21.666
From now on, I'm dialing
it back to a four.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.634
Four what?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.836
Oh, right--
your dial metaphor thing.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.606
I forgot about that
after I got shot.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.474
So what did the police say?

08:29.476 --> 08:30.909
They say they're
not investigating

08:30.911 --> 08:34.212
white on black crimes...
because of the economy.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.916
ROBERTA:
Girl, I was doubled over
in pain all morning.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.951
I barely made
it to class.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.121
Thank God it'll
all be over soon.

08:43.123 --> 08:48.226
Roberta, I know you're dying
a horrible, blood-gushing death!

08:48.228 --> 08:51.363
What?!
I've seen the bandages
in the bathroom.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.265
The disgusting bandages!

08:53.267 --> 08:56.034
Oh, my God.
Rallo, I'm not...

08:56.036 --> 08:57.269
I will do anything I can

08:57.271 --> 09:00.272
to make your last days
more pleasant.

09:00.274 --> 09:01.740
Anything.

09:02.408 --> 09:05.977
I have the flesh-eating virus.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.712
My stars!

09:07.714 --> 09:09.447
Yes, it's tragic.

09:09.449 --> 09:12.017
I guess it <i>woulds</i> help

09:12.019 --> 09:14.152
if I could be buried
in the right outfit.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.988
Kardashian Jeans--
it has to be Kardashians.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.823
But I don't have the $300.

09:18.825 --> 09:22.694
That's a lot of money
for some pants we're gonna bury.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.162
(coughing loudly)

09:24.164 --> 09:25.630
No, no, I'll get 'em.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.364
I have money.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.666
And could you
clean my room?

09:27.668 --> 09:30.135
Of course
I'll clean your room.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.637

09:35.075 --> 09:40.245

09:49.222 --> 09:52.290
Hey, it's bad,
bad Cleveland Brown!

09:52.292 --> 09:53.792
I'm sorry.
What's happening?

09:53.794 --> 09:56.161
We heard you got shot
saving Donna's life.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.731
Cleveland, you're number one
on my dog list-- top dog.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.132
Number two? Favre.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.368
Fellas, please.
I'm no hero.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.171
Uh, well, no-no one actually
used the word her...

10:06.173 --> 10:07.238
To Cleveland!

10:07.240 --> 10:08.373
ALL:
To Cleveland!

10:08.375 --> 10:09.975
Aye, is that
Cleveland Brown?

10:09.977 --> 10:13.011
I heard he killed
ten men with his bare hands!

10:13.013 --> 10:15.780
Aye, and I heard he
has the head of a man

10:15.782 --> 10:16.982
and the body of a lion.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.717
What? He's sitting
right there!

10:18.719 --> 10:20.819
He clearly doesn't
have a lion's body.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.989
Either play the game
or don't, Chad.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.326
(Cleveland whistling)

10:28.328 --> 10:29.995
(phone ringing)

10:29.997 --> 10:31.796
Talk to me.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.498
<i>The</i> Dan Rather?

10:33.500 --> 10:36.101
Wants me to be
on his show tomorrow?

10:36.103 --> 10:38.236
Hell, yeah,
ya'mo be there.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.206
That was the producer
of <i>Rather Early.</i>

10:41.208 --> 10:45.777
They want me to come on and
tell the story of my heroism!

10:45.779 --> 10:46.411
Oh, boy!

10:46.413 --> 10:48.213
I better go change
my Facebook status

10:48.215 --> 10:51.883
from "Cleveland Brown, Jr.
is playing marbles with Ernie,"

10:51.885 --> 10:54.386
to "Cleveland Brown, Jr.
is excited

10:54.388 --> 10:57.489
about his dad being on TV"!

10:57.491 --> 10:58.490
Mwah.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.324
Hello, dear.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.394
Here's your martini,
your newspaper and your pipe.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.329
I'll be here if
you need something.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.098
Otherwise, I'll keep
my mouth shut.
Oh, I get it.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.001
When I got shot, I actually
died and went to heaven.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.204
Because heaven is a place where
women will bring you a drink

11:13.206 --> 11:16.307
without any lip and keep
their opinions to themselves,

11:16.309 --> 11:20.045
because they realize
their words are just noise.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.346
Mm-hmm.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.447
I like new Donna.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.616
I was even thinking
tonight we could try

11:24.618 --> 11:28.820
that thing you've
always wanted to try.

11:28.822 --> 11:29.854
(giggles)

11:29.856 --> 11:31.556
You know, in the bedroom?

11:31.558 --> 11:33.825
You mean...?
That's right.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.428
You on top.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.366
You're doing
Roberta's laundry?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.368
Rallo, I don't know
what's going on,

11:43.370 --> 11:45.770
but I suspect Roberta
is playing you.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.872
Don't you talk that way
about my sister.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.407
She's dying, Mama!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.342
What?
What makes you say that?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.812
I found her
soiled bandages--

11:53.814 --> 11:55.180
the Max-eye Pads.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.550
Max-eye...
(gasps, laughs)

11:58.552 --> 12:00.051
Oh, Rallo!

12:00.053 --> 12:02.954
Oh, I'm sending this one
in to <i>Parade</i> magazine.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.023
Oh, I'm glad you find
it so delightful.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.793
Your daughter's not long
for this earth, woman!

12:08.795 --> 12:10.061
Rallo, sit.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.863
How do I put this?

12:11.865 --> 12:15.366
Once a month, a woman
bleeds uncontrollably.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.902
From where?
From her (whistles).

12:17.904 --> 12:19.404
Oh.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.371
(vomits)

12:20.373 --> 12:22.807
(audience cheering)

12:23.142 --> 12:25.410
Good morning,
I'm Dan Rather,

12:25.412 --> 12:26.911
news veteran of 44 years,

12:26.913 --> 12:31.182
and now reduced to co-hosting
this local morning chat show.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.051
Just passing the time
till I die.

12:33.053 --> 12:38.156
And I've stopped taking my heart
medication, so... any day now.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.158
With me, as always,
is Tila Tequila.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.926
(audience cheering)
What up, bitches!

12:41.928 --> 12:43.828
I make out with girls.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.163
Can you handle it?

12:45.165 --> 12:46.030
(cheering)

12:46.032 --> 12:47.632
(sighs)
Thank you, Tila.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.268
Coming up later--
hold on to your hubcaps--

12:50.270 --> 12:53.271
Stoolbend's only Mexican
will be showing us

12:53.273 --> 12:54.606
how to make "tack-os."

12:54.608 --> 12:57.108
I got a taco right here.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.077
Gross.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.845
Now, we meet
the brave citizen

13:00.847 --> 13:02.147
who fought off
a crazed gunman.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.016
Please welcome local hero,
Cleveland Brown.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.518
(cheering)
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13:06.520 --> 13:08.419
What's the frequency,
Kenneth?!

13:08.421 --> 13:10.221
(laughing)
I'm just playing.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.223
But seriously, dawg,
you know what it's like

13:12.225 --> 13:14.592
to be confronted
by a straight-up madman?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.261
This punk-ass fool
took my scrilla,

13:16.263 --> 13:18.296
then he be tryin'
to take my queen's bling.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.731
That's when I made
him recognize.

13:19.733 --> 13:23.401
Probbum is, crackhead was
strapped, so I got sprayed.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.202
What?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.103
Mr. Brown, <i>Rather Early</i>

13:25.105 --> 13:27.005
has exclusively
obtained this video

13:27.007 --> 13:30.275
from the ATM security camera
where the incident took place.

13:30.277 --> 13:34.445
What?! I wasn't told there
would be a clip, Dan.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.414
(nervous laughter)

13:36.882 --> 13:39.284
(audience exclaiming, booing)

13:39.286 --> 13:40.885
(gasps)

13:45.291 --> 13:48.059
All right, Favre, helmet on.
You're in.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.062
Hey, look,
our ATM's on TV!

13:51.064 --> 13:53.598
We, we're famous!

13:53.600 --> 13:55.233
(booing)

13:57.036 --> 14:01.139
So, Donna, how does it
feel to be married to a joke?

14:01.141 --> 14:03.942
And not a good joke,
but a bad joke,

14:03.944 --> 14:05.043
like that one I heard

14:05.045 --> 14:07.178
on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
<i>that one time.</i>

14:07.180 --> 14:09.480
Oh, I won't have my
man comparing himself

14:09.482 --> 14:11.482
to anything on NBC.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.584
You're right, damn it!

14:12.586 --> 14:15.520
I'm gonna go out there
and get your ring back!

14:15.522 --> 14:18.122
Because I'm better than NBC!

14:18.124 --> 14:20.992
They never gave
<i>Kath & Kim</i> sa chance!

14:20.994 --> 14:24.495
Cute show-- Molly Shannon,
somebody else.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.297
Mmm, Molly Shannon.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.801
Those underpants when she
fell into all those chairs.

14:29.803 --> 14:32.937
Cleveland, my ring.
Yep.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.142
Uh, excuse me, sir.

14:38.144 --> 14:41.679
Has anyone brought in a
woman's gold wedding band?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.081
Sir, this is a pawn shop.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.083
To think of profiting
on something as sordid

14:45.085 --> 14:48.419
as divorce is anathema
to everything I stand for.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.621
Get out.

14:49.623 --> 14:50.388
Forgive me.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.223
Hey, is that
a video camera?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.025
It is.
Is that a fog machine?

14:54.027 --> 14:57.962
Yes.
You don't happen to have
a saxophone, do you?

14:57.964 --> 14:58.630
Sure do.

Cool.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.560
Hey, later tonight
I'm having

15:29.562 --> 15:31.029
some people
over to my apartment.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.664
You should come.
Yeah, okay.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.699
You're not going
to come, are you?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.467
(chuckles)
No.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.270
If I can't
go after the mugger,

15:39.272 --> 15:43.274
maybe I'll make
the mugger go after me.

15:46.312 --> 15:49.013
Oh, I hope
I look good enough to rob

15:49.015 --> 15:51.449
but not good enough to rape.

16:12.604 --> 16:15.573
(Cleveland Jr.
and Ernie laughing)

16:15.575 --> 16:16.674
Oh, what's so funny?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.509
Are you guys
watching a JibJab?

16:18.511 --> 16:20.178
No, we're watching you.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.715
You're a YouTube sensation!
What?

16:25.551 --> 16:28.286
Oh, turn that mess
off before I...

16:28.288 --> 16:31.089
Hold on. Junior,
pause the video.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.190
Now, zoom in, quick!

16:32.192 --> 16:34.425
But you can't do that
on YouTube.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.327
I said zoom in!

16:37.096 --> 16:38.529
CLEVELAND, JR.:
We've lost too much resolution.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.164
I'll have to resample the image.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.067
Listen to me. I need you
to hack into the server

16:43.069 --> 16:44.602
using a buffer
overflow attack.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.204
Already done.
Well, what's left?

16:46.206 --> 16:49.140
I can open a backdoor to bypass
authentication and obtain

16:49.142 --> 16:52.343
remote access to the
Criminal Investigation Division.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.344
Do it. There! Look!

16:53.346 --> 16:56.447
The mugger's wearing a <i>Last</i>
<i>C</i> <i>all with Carson Daly</i> hat.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.150
Junior, cross-check
every retail database

16:59.152 --> 17:01.252
to find out how many
<i>Last Call</i> hats

17:01.254 --> 17:03.588
have been sold
in the United States.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.222
Two.

17:04.224 --> 17:07.892
One to a Mr. Carson Daly
in Valencia, California,

17:07.894 --> 17:13.097
and one was shipped to another
honky right here in Stoolbend.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.170
You're still
wearing your dress!

17:19.172 --> 17:20.338
Oh...

17:30.149 --> 17:32.350
(groans)

17:34.586 --> 17:36.821
Pornographic materials.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.357
This guy's a real pig.

17:40.292 --> 17:41.659
Mmm.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.829
Neat! Neat! Neat! Neat!

17:44.831 --> 17:47.131
Neat! Neat! Neat!
Neat! Neat!

17:47.133 --> 17:48.533
Hooray!

17:48.535 --> 17:50.435
Now I gotta find that ring.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.769
Oh, here it is.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.505
That was surprisingly
uncomplicated.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.307
(grunts)

18:00.245 --> 18:01.312
Ow!

18:01.314 --> 18:04.482
Oh, my Lord.
The mugger found where we live!

18:04.484 --> 18:05.516
We got robbed!

18:05.518 --> 18:07.618
No, we got even.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.620
299, 300.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.323
That's how much money I paid
for those jeans.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.292
And that's
how much money I got

18:14.294 --> 18:17.462
for selling everything
you own on Craigslist.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.565
Ooh! I will beat
your little black ass blue!

18:20.567 --> 18:22.533
And then I will
slap the black off of you.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.202
And then, I will use that
black to beat

18:24.204 --> 18:26.637
your blue ass black
all over again!

18:26.639 --> 18:28.306
You poor.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.541
Roberta, what's wrong?

18:30.543 --> 18:31.809
That time of the month?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.478
Yo, he means that
time of the month

18:33.480 --> 18:36.347
when the lining of
your uterus falls away.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.950
(guffawing, snickering)

18:38.952 --> 18:41.285
What are you going
to do to me?

18:41.287 --> 18:42.753
I'm going
to make you suffer

18:42.755 --> 18:44.889
the way you made
Jeanette Mueller suffer.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.859
That's right.
She was my mother.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.661
Wait-- who do you
think I am?

18:50.663 --> 18:53.331
Renfro Jenkins?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.766
Cleveland,
are you all right?

18:55.768 --> 18:57.502
Donna? How'd
you find me?

18:57.504 --> 19:00.204
Ever since you decided
to go out and find my ring,

19:00.206 --> 19:01.973
I've been trailing you.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.374
I was there
at the pawn shop

19:03.376 --> 19:04.675
and when you
dressed in drag.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.512
I didn't want anything
to happen to you, baby.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.581
So this whole time
you were protecting me?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.149
I'm sorry.

19:11.151 --> 19:14.018
I tried to change;
I really did.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.953
But, Cleveland,
I can't sit quietly

19:15.955 --> 19:18.122
in the background
like some Asian woman.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.590
It's just not me.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.224
I know, Donna.

19:20.226 --> 19:23.327
This strong, foxy
lady is who I married,

19:23.329 --> 19:24.762
and it's who I love.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.665
Oh, but it's happening
all over again.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.867
I came here to get
your ring back

19:29.869 --> 19:31.068
and prove that I'm a man.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.838
But now, the only
proof that I'm a man

19:33.840 --> 19:36.807
is my ambiguous
homophobia.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.847
No. Not this time, Cleveland.

19:43.782 --> 19:44.949
Aah! Damn it!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.684
You shot me!
(crying)

19:46.686 --> 19:49.654
Listen to me
and listen good.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.189
The mugger shot you.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.858
What? He didn't shoot...
Focus!

19:53.860 --> 19:56.060
(crying)
Now you're slapping me?

19:56.062 --> 19:59.130
Here, you can have
a butterscotch from my purse

19:59.132 --> 20:02.800
<i>if</i> you promise
to calm down.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.702
Okay, I've already
called the cops.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.771
When they get here,
you're going to tell them

20:06.773 --> 20:08.139
you confronted the mugger,

20:08.141 --> 20:09.941
there was a fight,
and he shot you.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.610
Mmm. May I have
another butterscotch?

20:12.612 --> 20:14.979
I don't have any more
butterscotches.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.582
I saw one in your purse.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.684
(sighs)
Fine!

20:19.686 --> 20:21.719
So there you were
with a bullet wound,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.988
but even with the blood
draining from your body,

20:23.990 --> 20:27.858
you overpowered him
and got my ring back.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.127
(sirens approaching)

20:30.629 --> 20:32.997
They're here.
Go, Cleveland.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.565
Wait, aren't you coming?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.100
No. You have
to go out there

20:36.102 --> 20:39.136
and take all the glory
for yourself.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.204
But why, Donna?

20:40.206 --> 20:43.407
(hoarsely):
Because Stoolbend needs a hero.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.110
(woman vocalizing)

20:47.913 --> 20:50.781
(breathes deeply)

20:53.385 --> 20:56.621
(cameras clicking)
