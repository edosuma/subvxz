00:00.797 --> 00:02.256
Previously on "Conviction"...

00:02.281 --> 00:05.199
Today, our city begins
a new era of justice.

00:05.235 --> 00:07.201
Wallace's golden boy. I took your job.

00:07.237 --> 00:08.169
Yes, you did.

00:08.204 --> 00:10.204
- Call me Frankie.
- I'm in charge of forensics.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.038
Tess... our paralegal.

00:11.073 --> 00:13.040
Maxine Bohen... lead investigator.

00:13.075 --> 00:14.542
I'd forgotten
what a good dancer you are.

00:14.577 --> 00:16.710
I haven't forgotten
kicking your ass in court.

00:16.746 --> 00:18.746
You have no idea what
that situation was like for me.

00:18.781 --> 00:20.047
I was right there.

00:20.082 --> 00:22.683
George had a gun 2 feet from my face.

00:22.718 --> 00:23.951
I told you you'd be good at this.

00:23.986 --> 00:25.385
And I told you I'm dangerous.

00:25.421 --> 00:27.120
I'm coming after your cases, too.

00:27.156 --> 00:28.321
I'd expect nothing less.

00:28.357 --> 00:31.258
She's stubborn, reactionary, fearless.

00:31.293 --> 00:32.759
I've never met anyone else like her.

00:32.795 --> 00:34.428
Next time you want to check up on me,

00:34.463 --> 00:35.596
find a different spy.

00:35.631 --> 00:38.498
The guy you put away...
he works in the city.

00:38.534 --> 00:39.666
He has a coffee cart.

00:39.701 --> 00:41.201
You seen him since he got out?

00:41.236 --> 00:43.103
Seek absolution on your own time.

00:43.138 --> 00:44.204
Hey, Small Coffee, Maple Scone.

00:44.239 --> 00:45.172
Hi.

00:45.207 --> 00:47.541
Oh, I got into forensics
when I was locked up.

00:47.576 --> 00:50.510
Pretty cool, you know, using
science to uncover the truth.

00:50.546 --> 00:51.546
Not a scotch fan?

00:51.580 --> 00:53.380
- I'm a drug addict.
- Interesting.

00:53.415 --> 00:55.515
I've hired outside
counsel... Naomi Golden.

00:55.551 --> 00:57.349
She's my ex-girlfriend.

00:57.385 --> 00:58.417
Mine, too.

00:58.453 --> 01:00.820
Lately you've seemed
a little off, showing up late.

01:00.855 --> 01:02.989
- I told you I had a meeting.
- Okay.

01:04.759 --> 01:06.325
I'm not cleaning up your mess again.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.527
Does it freak you out?
Committing to someone?

01:08.563 --> 01:10.463
I know it used to, but what about now?

01:10.498 --> 01:11.698
Depends on the person, I guess.

01:11.733 --> 01:14.733
Sounds like things are getting serious
between you and Naomi.

01:14.768 --> 01:16.768
Yeah. Big step, her moving to New York.

01:18.064 --> 01:19.705
Earl Slavitt... Shot and killed

01:19.730 --> 01:22.141
an assistant U.S. attorney,
a man named Tom Simon.

01:22.176 --> 01:24.543
You want someone to suffer for
what happened to your friend.

01:24.579 --> 01:26.678
- Yes. He was murdered.
- Not by me.

01:26.714 --> 01:28.380
Wallace, you have to stop
that execution.

01:28.416 --> 01:31.016
He used Harold
to pin the whole thing on Earl.

01:34.554 --> 01:36.221
Hayes?

01:36.256 --> 01:37.689
Open the door.

01:39.126 --> 01:41.159
I knew I couldn't do this job.
I told you.

01:43.697 --> 01:46.164
You wanted the truth, and I found it.

01:46.199 --> 01:47.332
Earl was innocent.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.700
And he... he died anyway.

01:52.139 --> 01:53.304
I couldn't save him.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.274
Open the door.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.643 --> 02:31.708
What?

02:32.911 --> 02:34.778
Just looking at you.

02:34.813 --> 02:36.713
Stop it.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.486
Excuse me, miss.

02:43.521 --> 02:44.587
Miss.

02:47.859 --> 02:49.726
- You're back.
- Congratulations.

02:49.761 --> 02:51.127
- On what?
- Your mom's election.

02:51.163 --> 02:52.628
Thanks. She's in D.C. already.

02:52.664 --> 02:54.397
What about you? You okay?

02:54.432 --> 02:55.565
Why wouldn't I be?

02:55.600 --> 02:57.600
Our next case... Sophie Hausen.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.268
Because Earl Slavitt was executed.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.670
After we proved he was innocent.

03:00.705 --> 03:02.471
Is this where
I eyeball you all with concern

03:02.507 --> 03:03.507
and ask if you're okay?

03:03.541 --> 03:05.641
We didn't meet Earl
or spend any time with him.

03:05.677 --> 03:07.610
He was a lovely man.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.345
Sophie Hausen, serving
a life sentence for the murder

03:10.380 --> 03:12.514
of college basketball star
Travis Carter.

03:12.549 --> 03:13.716
I know the case.

03:13.751 --> 03:16.685
She had motive, no alibi, her
DNA was on the murder weapon.

03:16.721 --> 03:18.420
Why do you think
it's a wrongful conviction?

03:18.455 --> 03:20.189
I don't... I just don't think
that a college student

03:20.224 --> 03:22.157
who loses her virginity
while unconscious

03:22.193 --> 03:24.259
should be locked up
for killing her rapist.

03:24.294 --> 03:25.527
So now you're pro-vigilante?

03:25.562 --> 03:27.161
Usually Sam's territory, I know,

03:27.197 --> 03:29.864
but if the state can execute
an innocent man,

03:29.899 --> 03:32.701
why shouldn't a rape victim
take justice into her own hands?

03:32.736 --> 03:34.269
The system let Sophie down.

03:34.304 --> 03:36.605
How do we know
that Travis Carter raped her?

03:36.640 --> 03:39.341
NYPD investigated.
There was no charges filed.

03:39.376 --> 03:41.175
No charges filed doesn't mean
no crime occurred.

03:41.211 --> 03:43.845
Yes, but an accusation of rape
isn't proof of rape.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.647
I hate to say this,
but five years working sex crimes

03:46.682 --> 03:48.274
taught me that both men and women lie.

03:48.299 --> 03:49.817
The university investigated, too.

03:49.853 --> 03:51.352
Found no credible evidence of...

03:51.387 --> 03:52.453
They had Sophie's testimony.

03:52.488 --> 03:53.420
Where she has no memory

03:53.456 --> 03:54.956
of anything that happened
in the bedroom.

03:54.991 --> 03:57.191
Which seems to suggest she was raped.

03:57.227 --> 03:59.159
- I'm with Tess.
- It... doesn't....matter.

04:00.896 --> 04:02.696
Look, Hayes, Earl was innocent.

04:02.732 --> 04:04.698
No matter how sympathetic
you are to Sophie,

04:04.734 --> 04:06.233
her situation is not the same.

04:06.269 --> 04:07.868
Getting raped,
it doesn't give you a free pass

04:07.903 --> 04:09.002
to murder the person who did it.

04:09.037 --> 04:12.539
Unless we can prove jury bias,
judicial overreach...

04:12.575 --> 04:13.840
any other legal technicality.

04:13.876 --> 04:15.408
We're gonna do whatever it takes

04:15.443 --> 04:16.843
to get this woman out of prison.

04:36.698 --> 04:39.332
- Choose a case?
- Sophie Hausen.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.901
Still shying away
from controversy, I see.

04:43.456 --> 04:44.540
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

04:44.565 --> 04:46.038
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

04:46.073 --> 04:48.407
Because they're concerned about you.

04:48.442 --> 04:50.009
Maybe some time off
wouldn't be the worst idea.

04:50.044 --> 04:51.724
Justice doesn't take a break.
Why should I?

04:53.915 --> 04:55.514
Okay.

04:55.549 --> 04:56.282
That was easy.

04:56.317 --> 04:57.683
Was I going to change your mind?

04:57.718 --> 04:58.583
No.

04:58.619 --> 04:59.885
Then why argue?

05:01.989 --> 05:03.388
How's Naomi?

05:04.425 --> 05:05.557
She's fine.

05:06.927 --> 05:08.593
We decided to take a break.

05:08.629 --> 05:10.562
Too much on my plate right now.

05:10.597 --> 05:12.897
Wait. This isn't... because... we...

05:14.000 --> 05:16.234
What happens in Indiana
stays in Indiana.

05:17.638 --> 05:19.604
Go battle injustice.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.306
Just take care of yourself.

05:30.783 --> 05:33.417
Travis was like a rock star on campus.

05:33.453 --> 05:36.920
He was charming and funny and so cute.

05:37.990 --> 05:41.325
I couldn't believe it
when he asked me out.

05:42.528 --> 05:45.463
Of all the girls on campus,
Travis Carter picked me.

05:45.498 --> 05:47.297
What happened once you got to the party?

05:47.333 --> 05:51.802
He brought me a punch,
and he kept refilling it.

05:51.838 --> 05:53.904
I didn't realize how strong it was.

05:53.939 --> 05:55.472
Travis and I were dancing,

05:55.507 --> 05:59.609
and I started to feel dizzy, sleepy.

05:59.644 --> 06:03.947
The next thing I remember
was waking up in his bed...

06:03.983 --> 06:06.483
naked..

06:06.518 --> 06:08.518
bleeding...

06:08.553 --> 06:10.653
in pain.

06:10.689 --> 06:12.822
At first, I didn't tell anyone.

06:12.858 --> 06:15.825
I wanted to pretend
like it hadn't happened.

06:15.861 --> 06:18.094
But then I realized I had to report it.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.132
No one believed me.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.835
Everywhere on campus,
people called me a liar.

06:25.871 --> 06:27.469
His teammates harassed me.

06:27.505 --> 06:30.006
The university let him
keep playing basketball.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.108
I was a pariah.

06:32.143 --> 06:33.509
So you got revenge.

06:33.544 --> 06:34.843
No, I didn't kill him.

06:34.879 --> 06:37.242
- Makes no difference to me.
- Why?

06:37.267 --> 06:39.715
Because Travis was a criminal,
and criminals deserve to be punished.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.684
I won't argue Travis didn't
deserve what happened to him,

06:42.720 --> 06:43.985
but I did not shoot him.

06:44.021 --> 06:45.053
I need you to believe me.

06:45.088 --> 06:45.954
Well, that would be easier

06:45.989 --> 06:47.856
if your DNA wasn't on the murder weapon.

06:47.892 --> 06:49.157
Well, I was in Travis' room.

06:49.192 --> 06:51.059
Maybe it transferred
from something that I touched.

06:51.094 --> 06:53.695
The gun used to kill Travis
was the same make and model

06:53.731 --> 06:55.831
as the one you bought
a month after your rape.

06:55.866 --> 06:57.699
That wasn't my gun in Travis' room.

06:57.735 --> 07:00.701
Which we can't prove, because
the serial number was filed off.

07:00.737 --> 07:03.371
If you want to convince me,
tell me how to find your gun.

07:03.407 --> 07:05.006
Go to the bottom of the East River.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.707
I threw it off the Queensboro Bridge

07:06.743 --> 07:08.043
weeks before Travis was shot.

07:08.078 --> 07:09.110
Why would you buy a gun

07:09.146 --> 07:11.679
only to throw it away
almost immediately afterwards?

07:11.714 --> 07:13.014
I didn't get it to kill him.

07:18.588 --> 07:20.154
I got it to kill myself.

07:26.763 --> 07:29.764
Thank God that I finally went
to the rape crisis center.

07:29.799 --> 07:32.199
I got counseling,
and that helped me realize

07:32.234 --> 07:35.202
that what Travis did to me
was not my fault,

07:35.237 --> 07:37.004
no matter how much I drank

07:37.039 --> 07:38.905
or whether I thought he was cute or not.

07:40.809 --> 07:42.742
But I did not murder him.

07:42.778 --> 07:43.743
Okay.

07:43.779 --> 07:44.779
No, please!

07:44.813 --> 07:48.182
All I have left is the truth.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.616
Tell me that you believe me.

07:49.651 --> 07:52.786
I believe you don't belong in here.

07:52.821 --> 07:54.754
And I'm going to find a way
to get you out.

08:01.563 --> 08:03.062
Got to work later than usual today.

08:03.098 --> 08:04.163
You checking up on me?

08:04.199 --> 08:05.931
Yeah. I'm not gonna let you
get in trouble again.

08:05.967 --> 08:07.433
I had breakfast with my sponsor.

08:07.469 --> 08:09.068
I'm going to meetings,
I'm working the program.

08:09.104 --> 08:10.069
So you're clean?

08:10.105 --> 08:11.537
Should I pee in a cup?

08:11.572 --> 08:13.606
Max, I'm trying to help you.

08:13.641 --> 08:14.773
I'm worried.

08:14.809 --> 08:16.775
I really appreciate it,
but this is my problem,

08:16.811 --> 08:18.077
and I will handle it, okay?

08:18.113 --> 08:19.113
Okay.

08:20.248 --> 08:22.214
Hey. Here you go.

08:22.249 --> 08:23.415
Thanks.

08:25.252 --> 08:27.720
Sophie Hausen murdered
Travis Carter. I'm sure of it.

08:27.755 --> 08:29.655
Why? No one saw her
at the frat house that night.

08:29.690 --> 08:31.957
We know she was there. Her DNA
was on the murder weapon,

08:31.993 --> 08:33.826
which matches the gun
that she purchased,

08:33.861 --> 08:36.128
except for the conveniently
filed-off serial numbers.

08:36.163 --> 08:37.796
I understand you were also the detective

08:37.832 --> 08:39.097
on Sophie's sexual-assault case?

08:39.133 --> 08:41.099
Yeah, I did the prelim
on Sophie's complaint.

08:41.135 --> 08:43.601
Whether there was an assault,
none of us will ever know.

08:45.272 --> 08:46.971
Don't get me wrong.

08:47.007 --> 08:49.274
Sophie was very upset.
She felt violated.

08:49.309 --> 08:51.109
But as a cop trying to build a case,

08:51.145 --> 08:52.677
didn't have a lot to go on.

08:52.712 --> 08:53.978
She didn't come forward for two weeks.

08:54.014 --> 08:54.879
That's not uncommon.

08:54.915 --> 08:57.148
No, but it erases any physical evidence.

08:57.183 --> 08:59.984
Bruises are long gone,
drugs will be out of the system.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.819
It doesn't mean she wasn't drugged.

09:01.855 --> 09:04.589
You know when Sophie reported
Travis Carter raped her?

09:04.624 --> 09:05.990
After several friends told her

09:06.026 --> 09:08.593
they'd heard Carter joking
about her being a lousy lay.

09:08.628 --> 09:10.695
And you think that motivated
Sophie's accusations?

09:10.730 --> 09:11.762
It's possible.

09:11.797 --> 09:13.997
I mean, look, we're talking
about college kids here.

09:14.033 --> 09:15.832
They don't always have
a sense of proportion

09:15.868 --> 09:17.134
on anything they do or say.

09:18.837 --> 09:21.105
Travis Carter was
a complete jerk to women,

09:21.140 --> 09:24.041
but we couldn't prove he was a rapist.

09:24.077 --> 09:27.278
Sophie Hausen, on the other hand...

09:27.313 --> 09:29.680
her DNA's on the murder weapon.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.887
Tess.

09:36.922 --> 09:38.822
Your friend was downstairs
looking for you.

09:38.857 --> 09:40.891
Matty. Hi.

09:40.926 --> 09:42.525
What are you doing here?

09:42.561 --> 09:43.561
Thanks.

09:46.898 --> 09:48.864
Um, since you haven't been by lately,

09:48.900 --> 09:51.067
I figured I'd bring the truck
to you... maple scone and all.

09:52.370 --> 09:55.037
So nice. Thank you.

09:55.073 --> 09:58.174
Uh, look, it's been cool
texting with you,

09:58.210 --> 09:59.875
especially during the Giants games.

09:59.911 --> 10:02.044
Um...

10:02.080 --> 10:05.147
I was wondering if you maybe
want to go to Jersey for a game

10:05.182 --> 10:06.816
or catch a movie.

10:08.185 --> 10:09.551
Oh, I, um...

10:09.587 --> 10:10.853
Look, no pressure.

10:10.888 --> 10:12.888
It's just...

10:12.924 --> 10:14.189
I like you.

10:14.225 --> 10:16.859
And I'd like to get to know you better.

10:23.700 --> 10:24.833
Hanging out sounds great.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.703
Cool. Uh, so we'll
set something up, then.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.906
All right.

10:39.783 --> 10:42.083
Hey. So, that's the guy, huh?

10:42.119 --> 10:45.553
The one you... you put away
for... for killing your aunt?

10:46.757 --> 10:50.924
You said he was Asian, tall,
thin, works a coffee cart.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.860
Hey, that's awesome
that you told him who you are

10:52.895 --> 10:53.994
and he's cool with it.

10:55.131 --> 10:57.131
I was thinking about the DNA results.

10:57.167 --> 11:00.234
The killer used a pillow to
muffle the sound of the shots.

11:00.270 --> 11:02.870
Maybe that's how Sophie's DNA
got on the gun.

11:02.905 --> 11:05.139
But how does Travis' pillow
connect back to Sophie?

11:05.175 --> 11:07.141
It was from the bed
where Sophie was raped,

11:07.176 --> 11:09.977
so Sophie's skin cells could've
been transferred to the gun.

11:10.012 --> 11:11.945
But they had sex
six months before the murder.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.246
They didn't have sex. She was raped.

11:13.282 --> 11:16.116
NYPD and campus cops didn't even
think there was a case.

11:16.152 --> 11:17.951
Do you know how often that happens,

11:17.987 --> 11:20.287
especially when
the accused rapist is an athlete

11:20.322 --> 11:22.723
generating millions of dollars
for the school?

11:22.758 --> 11:24.791
Okay, but you know
what else happens a lot?

11:24.826 --> 11:27.427
People get drunk. They have sex
and then they regret it.

11:27.462 --> 11:29.962
You can't have sex
when you're unconscious.

11:29.998 --> 11:31.964
If she was unconscious, then yes...

11:32.000 --> 11:33.166
clearly rape, absolutely.

11:33.202 --> 11:35.935
But if she blacked out,
then maybe she doesn't remember

11:35.970 --> 11:37.837
what she did
or what she asked him to do.

11:37.872 --> 11:40.773
If she was that drunk,
then she didn't have the mental clarity

11:40.809 --> 11:42.408
to consent to anything, much less sex.

11:42.443 --> 11:45.978
But drinking doesn't free you up
from responsibility.

11:46.014 --> 11:48.981
If you're drunk
and you go out and steal a car

11:49.017 --> 11:51.851
or rob a liquor store,
that's still on you,

11:51.886 --> 11:52.985
and you're still gonna do time.

11:53.021 --> 11:54.320
That's not the same thing, Frankie.

11:54.355 --> 11:56.322
He was feeding her drinks.

11:56.357 --> 11:57.956
Hold on, hold on.

11:57.991 --> 12:00.025
- I think I got something.
- What is it?

12:00.060 --> 12:03.329
Exactly what Hayes told us to look for.

12:04.685 --> 12:06.018
A flaw.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.200
On the Travis Carter murder,
you only had access

12:08.236 --> 12:09.935
to a small amount of genetic material.

12:09.970 --> 12:12.271
Our DNA lab uses
lowcopy-number analysis.

12:12.306 --> 12:15.207
It's a new technique.
I doubt you're familiar with it.

12:15.242 --> 12:17.175
Where did you get your training?

12:17.211 --> 12:19.377
Uh, Queensboro Correctional, for one.

12:19.412 --> 12:21.713
And I'm familiar with the technique...

12:21.749 --> 12:23.782
replicating DNA fragments
into a single strand.

12:23.817 --> 12:24.883
You can get a full profile

12:24.918 --> 12:27.685
from as little as 10 trillionths
of a gram of material.

12:27.721 --> 12:29.687
Oh, looks like
you've done your homework...

12:29.723 --> 12:32.156
at... Queensboro Correctional.

12:32.191 --> 12:34.492
So did I... at Stanford.

12:34.527 --> 12:35.527
Mm.

12:35.562 --> 12:37.862
But using DNA fragments
to create an entire strand

12:37.897 --> 12:39.364
magnifies the margin of error.

12:39.399 --> 12:41.332
Well, that's why our technicians
follow strict protocols.

12:41.368 --> 12:44.034
Right, right...
like checking your final I.D.s

12:44.070 --> 12:46.237
with probabilistic genotyping software

12:46.272 --> 12:48.973
to reduce the chance of
misidentification and human error.

12:49.008 --> 12:49.807
Yes.

12:49.842 --> 12:51.909
- In every case?
- Yes.

12:51.944 --> 12:53.310
That's... That's funny,

12:53.345 --> 12:56.313
'cause that step was left off
the official DNA report.

12:59.051 --> 13:02.319
I had the lab re-analyze the DNA
found on the gun that killed Travis...

13:02.354 --> 13:04.053
this time, with the complete protocol.

13:04.089 --> 13:05.822
It's only a partial match to Sophie.

13:05.857 --> 13:08.492
- How partial?
- It's the difference between a Camaro

13:08.527 --> 13:10.927
with a particular color
and a specific license plate

13:10.962 --> 13:11.995
and just any Camaro.

13:12.030 --> 13:14.097
The DNA on the murder weapon
was the only evidence

13:14.132 --> 13:16.199
that conclusively tied Sophie
to the crime scene.

13:16.234 --> 13:17.734
That's more than just a mistake.

13:17.770 --> 13:20.069
I know. It's an atomic bomb. It means...

13:20.105 --> 13:21.470
Sophie might actually be innocent.

13:30.691 --> 13:32.302
_

13:32.327 --> 13:34.261
The DNA evidence against Sophie is out.

13:34.296 --> 13:36.129
That's huge. More than just a flaw.

13:36.165 --> 13:37.563
But it doesn't exonerate her.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.332
Look, DNA can prove
that you did touch a gun,

13:39.367 --> 13:40.900
but it can't prove that you didn't...

13:40.935 --> 13:42.207
or, in this case, that anyone did.

13:42.232 --> 13:43.293
The sample's contaminated.

13:43.318 --> 13:45.300
Still pokes a huge hole
in the case against Sophie.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.306
It's enough to get her a retrial.

13:46.341 --> 13:48.808
We're not getting her a retrial.
We're getting her out.

13:48.843 --> 13:50.610
- We need to be reasonable.
- No, we don't.

13:50.645 --> 13:51.911
We have four days left.

13:51.946 --> 13:52.986
We're not abandoning Sophie

13:53.014 --> 13:54.947
to the system that screwed her
the first time...

13:54.982 --> 13:56.315
the same system that executed Earl.

13:56.350 --> 13:57.616
- Hayes...
- Go back to the crime scene.

13:57.651 --> 14:00.152
See if you can find out any more
about what happened that night.

14:00.188 --> 14:01.954
Go check the handgun registry database.

14:01.989 --> 14:04.990
See if there's anyone else that knew
Travis that owned a .38 caliber.

14:05.026 --> 14:07.026
Let's see if we can tie the gun
to someone else.

14:07.061 --> 14:08.093
Where are you going?

14:08.129 --> 14:10.329
To offer my condolences
to the rapist's mother.

14:19.206 --> 14:22.040
Travis was always an overachiever.

14:23.076 --> 14:26.377
He could've joined the NBA
after his junior year,

14:26.412 --> 14:30.348
but he wanted to stay
to finish his degree.

14:30.383 --> 14:34.319
He was already thinking
about his post-pro career.

14:34.354 --> 14:37.889
He was a bright, fun-loving boy.

14:37.924 --> 14:40.062
- Thank you.
- Mm.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.193
I'm sorry... I have to ask.

14:43.229 --> 14:45.663
A classmate accused Travis
of raping her.

14:45.698 --> 14:46.864
That was a lie.

14:46.899 --> 14:48.366
How can you be sure?

14:48.401 --> 14:52.370
That girl went crazy
after Travis rejected her.

14:52.405 --> 14:54.372
She made up that story.

14:54.407 --> 14:57.842
And when no one believed her,
she murdered my son.

14:58.678 --> 15:02.512
We're no longer certain that
Sophie Hausen killed Travis.

15:02.547 --> 15:04.647
Of course she did.
Her DNA is on the gun.

15:04.683 --> 15:05.615
We reran those tests

15:05.650 --> 15:08.151
and found the results
to be inconclusive.

15:08.187 --> 15:11.054
Was there anyone else that
Travis was in conflict with?

15:11.090 --> 15:13.690
Not that he mentioned to me.

15:13.725 --> 15:15.625
Travis was very popular.

15:17.729 --> 15:20.329
You might actually
be able to understand.

15:20.365 --> 15:22.399
Travis was in national magazines

15:22.434 --> 15:23.900
when he was still in high school.

15:23.935 --> 15:27.069
He became an instant celebrity.

15:27.105 --> 15:31.107
And when he went to college,
it was more of the same.

15:31.142 --> 15:32.942
Anywhere he went...

15:32.977 --> 15:36.612
restaurants, bars, the library...

15:36.647 --> 15:39.081
girls were after him.

15:39.117 --> 15:44.020
The notion that he raped
that girl is absurd.

15:44.055 --> 15:45.187
He didn't need to.

15:45.223 --> 15:47.423
With all those girls chasing him,

15:47.458 --> 15:49.958
maybe another one of them went crazy.

15:49.993 --> 15:54.062
I raised my son to respect women.

15:54.097 --> 15:57.933
But, as with all boys...

15:57.968 --> 15:59.401
men...

15:59.437 --> 16:02.404
he did stupid and immature things.

16:04.174 --> 16:05.974
But he didn't deserve to die.

16:15.752 --> 16:17.271
The guy from the coffee cart...

16:17.296 --> 16:19.515
I didn't tell him I'm the reason
he went to prison.

16:21.158 --> 16:22.590
And he asked me out.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.425
And you said no, right?

16:24.461 --> 16:25.593
He's really nice.

16:25.628 --> 16:27.094
Tess!

16:27.822 --> 16:30.165
I wanted to spend some time
with him, see how he's doing.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.467
Look, I know you're scared
of how he's gonna react,

16:32.502 --> 16:35.302
but keeping him in the dark ain't right.

16:37.106 --> 16:38.472
You got to tell him.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.278
What's that?

16:44.313 --> 16:46.080
Ballistic gel.

16:46.115 --> 16:47.515
It simulates human muscle tissue...

16:47.549 --> 16:48.515
allows us to measure

16:48.550 --> 16:50.451
the angles the bullets
entered Travis' body.

16:50.486 --> 16:53.390
So we can confirm Sophie was the
correct height to be the shooter.

16:53.415 --> 16:54.754
Exactly.

16:54.790 --> 16:57.156
The night of the murder,
the frat house was pretty empty.

16:57.192 --> 16:58.592
Most of the guys were out partying.

16:58.627 --> 16:59.759
When the detectives arrived,

16:59.795 --> 17:01.427
they found the back door propped open.

17:01.463 --> 17:04.196
So the killer could've
come through the back stairs.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.132
At 10:35, Travis exchanged texts

17:06.166 --> 17:08.134
with a teammate at Dockford's Bar.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.816
_

17:14.575 --> 17:16.309
He immediately texted back.

17:17.222 --> 17:18.972
_

17:19.547 --> 17:21.446
Based on the position of Travis' body,

17:21.483 --> 17:23.682
the killer surprised him
as he left the bathroom.

17:23.718 --> 17:25.351
The killer used a pillow
from Travis' bed

17:25.387 --> 17:26.419
to muffle the sound of the gunshots.

17:26.454 --> 17:28.787
Actually wouldn't have
silenced it all that much.

17:28.823 --> 17:30.355
Lucky for the killer,

17:30.391 --> 17:31.790
there was loud music playing that night.

17:31.826 --> 17:33.091
All right, time to switch.

17:34.228 --> 17:35.327
You don't trust me?

17:35.362 --> 17:37.630
You've fired a gun before?

17:37.665 --> 17:39.231
My grandpa's from Texas.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.799
And I'm closer to Sophie's height.

17:40.835 --> 17:42.367
All yours.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.568
Travis was shot in
the lower abdomen five times.

18:16.603 --> 18:18.102
- Nice grouping.
- Thanks.

18:18.137 --> 18:20.704
Holes match up to a shooter
of Sophie's height.

18:20.739 --> 18:23.174
Down pillow wasn't conducive
to a clean getaway.

18:23.209 --> 18:25.276
Friction from the bullets
creates static electricity,

18:25.311 --> 18:26.843
causing the feathers to stick to you.

18:28.747 --> 18:30.781
There were none in the hallway.

18:30.816 --> 18:33.217
- None what?
- Feathers.

18:35.253 --> 18:37.721
No way the shooter
leaves this room that way

18:37.756 --> 18:39.222
without leaving a trail.

18:39.257 --> 18:41.257
Or without running into
one of Travis' housemates.

18:41.293 --> 18:43.226
They ran up
as soon as they heard the shots.

18:45.430 --> 18:47.497
Window's the only other way out.

18:48.934 --> 18:50.233
Barbed wire.

18:50.268 --> 18:51.601
Makes for a tough climb.

18:51.636 --> 18:53.736
Sophie was a varsity soccer player.

18:53.771 --> 18:55.405
But even with a coat and gloves,

18:55.440 --> 18:57.107
no way anybody gets over that fence

18:57.142 --> 18:58.874
without getting all cut up.

18:58.910 --> 19:00.376
Wait... Sophie was arrested

19:00.412 --> 19:02.312
less than 48 hours
after Travis' murder...

19:02.347 --> 19:04.247
without a mark or a cut on her body.

19:04.282 --> 19:06.882
Makes it pretty unlikely
that she's the killer.

19:08.285 --> 19:09.485
I'll call Maxine and Sam,

19:09.520 --> 19:11.453
have them check the local ERs
around the time of the shooting.

19:11.489 --> 19:12.554
Okay.

19:18.496 --> 19:19.294
Hello?

19:19.330 --> 19:21.296
You're back!

19:21.332 --> 19:22.431
How's Mom?

19:22.466 --> 19:24.466
Bossing people around
Capitol Hill, happy as a clam.

19:24.502 --> 19:25.467
Are you moving with her?

19:25.503 --> 19:28.937
No. I'm afraid
you're stuck with me for now.

19:28.972 --> 19:30.539
I heard about your client. I'm sorry.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.275
Something happened afterwards.

19:36.514 --> 19:38.147
Wallace and I slept together.

19:38.182 --> 19:40.348
Ah. Sex and death...
Classic combination.

19:40.383 --> 19:41.449
No shame there.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.818
Yesterday, he told me
he'd called it quits with Naomi.

19:43.854 --> 19:44.753
Now, that's a big deal.

19:44.788 --> 19:46.487
He didn't break up with her
because of me.

19:46.523 --> 19:47.488
Oh, no, he just dumped her

19:47.524 --> 19:49.658
after the two of you had
amazing, passionate sex.

19:49.693 --> 19:51.459
How do you know what kind of sex we had?

19:51.494 --> 19:53.494
You're a Morrison.
We only have one kind.

19:55.699 --> 19:56.984
I think this is great.

19:57.009 --> 19:59.467
I think the two of you should
just stop sparring and go for it.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.212
We've been down that road.
It doesn't work.

20:01.237 --> 20:02.670
It's different. You've changed.

20:02.705 --> 20:03.705
I haven't.

20:06.543 --> 20:08.876
Your client... Was it hard losing him?

20:08.911 --> 20:10.611
It was terrible.

20:10.647 --> 20:11.612
See?

20:11.648 --> 20:13.714
Now, if I would've asked you
that same question

20:13.749 --> 20:15.716
three months ago... before this job...

20:15.751 --> 20:17.384
you would've said something different.

20:17.419 --> 20:18.652
You wouldn't have admitted it.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.688
You've changed.

20:20.723 --> 20:22.455
Perhaps Wallace has, too.

20:22.491 --> 20:24.524
I think the two of you
might be ready for this.

20:26.762 --> 20:29.362
Jackson, look.
It's your black friend Maxine.

20:29.398 --> 20:30.497
Shut up, Hayes.

20:30.532 --> 20:31.631
Hi, Maxine.

20:32.568 --> 20:33.568
What are you doing here?

20:33.602 --> 20:34.834
The doorman buzzed me up.

20:34.869 --> 20:36.703
Sam and I combed through
every ER in Queens

20:36.738 --> 20:37.671
and found this...

20:37.706 --> 20:39.872
John Bianchi,
former campus cop at Bayside,

20:39.908 --> 20:41.874
sliced his hand
the night of the shooting.

20:41.910 --> 20:44.211
Possibly from climbing
the frat house fence.

20:44.246 --> 20:45.878
Any connection with Travis Carter?

20:45.914 --> 20:46.813
A big one.

20:46.848 --> 20:48.848
He was a campus cop who was the co-lead

20:48.883 --> 20:51.684
on the university's
investigation of Sophie's rape.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.887
He was fired because Travis
accused him of harassment.

20:54.923 --> 20:56.322
Bianchi believed Sophie?

20:56.357 --> 20:57.357
And had a .38...

20:57.391 --> 20:59.491
the same make and model
as our murder weapon.

20:59.527 --> 21:00.860
He could be our shooter.

21:09.742 --> 21:11.039
_

21:11.573 --> 21:13.206
It was time for me to move on,

21:13.241 --> 21:14.673
do something new with my life.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.409
Your former campus police supervisor
told us you were fired

21:17.444 --> 21:20.212
because you wouldn't stop
investigating Travis Carter.

21:20.248 --> 21:22.647
He was a rapist. I was doing my job.

21:22.683 --> 21:25.550
Both your supervisor and
the NYPD detective disagreed.

21:25.586 --> 21:28.353
Which had nothing to do
with Carter being the top scorer

21:28.389 --> 21:30.522
on a team that was closing in
on a national title.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.790
They weren't interested in justice,

21:31.825 --> 21:34.025
so you took matters into your own hands.

21:35.396 --> 21:36.762
Wait... You think I killed Carter?

21:36.787 --> 21:38.379
You had motive.
You just told us as much.

21:38.404 --> 21:40.265
And we have strong evidence
that whoever killed him

21:40.300 --> 21:41.365
got injured trying to get away.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.268
And even stronger evidence
that you went to the ER

21:43.303 --> 21:45.103
two days after the murder...

21:45.138 --> 21:46.271
an infected cut on your hand.

21:46.595 --> 21:48.929
Probably because you avoided
treatment the night of the murder.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.576
Look, Travis Carter
got what he deserved,

21:52.612 --> 21:54.144
but he didn't get it from me.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.379
Then how'd you get
the gash on your hand?

21:55.415 --> 21:57.247
I make Shaker furniture as a hobby.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.283
I was turning a chair leg on the lathe,

21:59.319 --> 22:00.418
and the chisel broke.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.155
You guys are sure
it's not any of the other girls?

22:05.191 --> 22:05.989
Other girls?

22:06.025 --> 22:08.058
The other girls that Travis raped.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.593
The only girl that Travis Carter

22:09.629 --> 22:11.561
was ever accused of raping was Sophie.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.764
I-I assumed Elyse was the one
that pointed you to me.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.033
Who's Elyse?

22:21.172 --> 22:22.205
You told Officer Bianchi

22:22.240 --> 22:24.640
that three more women
came to the rape crisis center

22:24.675 --> 22:26.508
six months after Sophie's rape,
all saying

22:26.544 --> 22:28.477
that they were sexually
assaulted by Travis Carter.

22:28.512 --> 22:29.445
Yes, that's true.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.612
We need the names.

22:30.648 --> 22:32.214
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

22:33.651 --> 22:36.151
You shared that info
with Officer Bianchi.

22:36.186 --> 22:37.386
I told him the women existed.

22:37.421 --> 22:40.489
I never gave him their names
or any identifying information.

22:40.524 --> 22:41.557
So what's the point?

22:41.592 --> 22:43.625
Without the names,
the police can't investigate.

22:43.661 --> 22:45.093
And the D.A. can't file charges.

22:45.128 --> 22:47.195
I tried to get the victims
to come forward,

22:47.231 --> 22:49.497
but after how Sophie
was treated, they refused.

22:49.532 --> 22:50.665
Then why share anything?

22:50.700 --> 22:53.501
I thought that if the police
knew Travis was a predator,

22:53.536 --> 22:55.337
then the next girl who did come forward

22:55.372 --> 22:57.172
would have an easier time
convincing them.

22:57.207 --> 22:58.506
There's still a chance to help Sophie.

22:58.541 --> 23:00.342
By giving you the other victims' names?

23:00.377 --> 23:02.143
So you can try and put them in prison?

23:03.380 --> 23:05.480
We believe that Sophie's innocent.

23:05.515 --> 23:06.714
The others may not be.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.516
I hope you get Sophie out,

23:08.551 --> 23:11.218
but even if I could tell you
the other women's names,

23:11.254 --> 23:12.286
I wouldn't.

23:12.321 --> 23:15.289
I won't help you lock up
any of his other victims.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.193
Sam and Maxine hit a dead end.

23:19.228 --> 23:20.494
Any luck figuring out the names

23:20.529 --> 23:22.196
of the other girls Travis Carter raped?

23:22.231 --> 23:23.330
Allegedly raped.

23:23.366 --> 23:25.699
We've been reviewing the
evidence from Sophie's trial.

23:25.734 --> 23:28.635
There were dozens of pages
of transcribed texts.

23:28.670 --> 23:31.471
Carter's phone had messages
from 15 girls

23:31.507 --> 23:33.173
who argued or cut off communication

23:33.209 --> 23:34.249
after hooking up with him.

23:34.277 --> 23:36.075
Of the 15, four... including Sophie...

23:36.111 --> 23:37.544
visited the student health center

23:37.579 --> 23:39.379
within 48 hours of interacting with him.

23:39.415 --> 23:41.347
Maybe not-so-allegedly raped.

23:41.383 --> 23:43.550
How do you know they visited
the healthcare center?

23:43.585 --> 23:45.251
You can't get into
any building on the campus

23:45.287 --> 23:46.820
without swiping your I.D.

23:46.855 --> 23:49.155
University keeps records
of who goes in and who goes out.

23:49.190 --> 23:50.190
Thank you, Big Brother.

23:50.225 --> 23:51.691
We should subpoena those records,

23:51.727 --> 23:53.692
see where those girls were
the night of the murder.

23:53.728 --> 23:55.828
Maybe we won't have to.

23:55.863 --> 23:57.563
This is Sophie's profile page.

23:57.598 --> 24:00.400
Three days before Travis
was killed, she got a message

24:00.435 --> 24:02.601
from one of the other victims,
Lucy Bates.

24:02.637 --> 24:04.677
"Thanks for sharing.
I'll take care of the problem."

24:04.705 --> 24:06.739
Maybe the problem
she's talking about was Travis.

24:08.776 --> 24:10.676
I believe you, Sophie.

24:10.711 --> 24:13.178
It wasn't your DNA on the gun.
You didn't shoot Travis.

24:13.213 --> 24:14.847
I had no idea.

24:14.882 --> 24:16.449
Lucy never said anything.

24:16.484 --> 24:17.516
This is good news.

24:17.552 --> 24:20.185
Three other women were raped.
How is that good news?

24:20.220 --> 24:23.589
All three are viable suspects
in Travis' murder.

24:23.624 --> 24:25.424
Did you know Maya or Karina?

24:25.459 --> 24:26.591
No, I'd never met them.

24:26.626 --> 24:27.859
But you knew Lucy.

24:27.894 --> 24:30.429
You two texted multiple times
the week before Travis was shot.

24:30.464 --> 24:32.864
She talked about solving
a problem. What was it?

24:32.899 --> 24:35.200
We lived in the same dorm.
It could've been tons of things.

24:35.235 --> 24:37.436
If you want to get out of here,
you can't protect Lucy.

24:37.471 --> 24:39.271
- I'm not.
- Even if you planned it together,

24:39.306 --> 24:40.605
if you didn't pull the trigger...

24:40.640 --> 24:42.707
We didn't plan anything.
I told you that.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.609
Anything that would cast
suspicion on these women...

24:44.644 --> 24:45.644
"These women"?

24:46.480 --> 24:49.213
If the university
had taken me seriously,

24:49.248 --> 24:51.282
if they had cared more about me
than basketball,

24:51.317 --> 24:53.317
those other women
might not have gotten raped.

24:53.353 --> 24:54.452
I can't help you

24:54.488 --> 24:56.788
if you don't give me something,
Sophie... anything.

24:56.823 --> 24:58.755
Otherwise, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in here.

24:58.791 --> 25:02.093
I'm sorry. I really want
to help you, but I just can't.

25:04.797 --> 25:06.763
Let's hope one of the other girls can.

25:14.957 --> 25:16.457
_

25:16.702 --> 25:18.669
Lucy...

25:18.704 --> 25:22.106
Where'd you first meet Travis?

25:22.141 --> 25:25.009
I was... at the library.

25:25.044 --> 25:26.243
In the bookstore.

25:26.279 --> 25:28.078
We were looking at sweatshirts.

25:28.114 --> 25:30.047
He was really nice.

25:30.082 --> 25:30.981
At first.

25:31.017 --> 25:35.251
He invited me to a party
at the frat house.

25:35.287 --> 25:37.587
I was like, "Wow.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.889
I'm gonna be
Travis Carter's girlfriend."

25:41.159 --> 25:42.426
"Me."

25:42.461 --> 25:45.562
He kept refilling my cup with punch.

25:45.597 --> 25:49.032
I didn't even realize
how much I'd drunk until...

25:49.067 --> 25:51.434
...we got back to his bedroom.

25:51.469 --> 25:54.637
He said I could lie down and rest.

25:54.672 --> 25:57.106
He said he wanted
to show me his trophies.

25:57.142 --> 26:01.577
I thought he was really sweet and funny.

26:01.612 --> 26:02.612
And then...

26:02.647 --> 26:05.214
...everything went black.

26:07.485 --> 26:09.251
Until I woke up.

26:09.286 --> 26:12.054
I was naked.

26:12.089 --> 26:14.089
My pants were down around my ankles.

26:14.124 --> 26:15.424
My bra was gone.

26:15.460 --> 26:19.228
Travis wasn't there, but...

26:19.263 --> 26:20.463
I was bleeding.

26:20.498 --> 26:22.164
I knew that he raped me.

26:22.199 --> 26:25.334
I cried... for days.

26:25.369 --> 26:31.073
And, um, then I went
to the health center

26:31.108 --> 26:34.977
and I spoke to a rape crisis counselor.

26:35.012 --> 26:36.245
She was awesome.

26:36.280 --> 26:40.014
She understood.

26:40.049 --> 26:41.750
She just listened.

26:43.152 --> 26:44.986
She wanted me to file a police report.

26:45.021 --> 26:47.088
I saw what they did to Sophie.

26:47.123 --> 26:48.757
They ruined her.

26:50.226 --> 26:52.460
I just wanted
a normal college experience.

26:52.496 --> 26:55.496
I know I should've reported it, but...

26:55.531 --> 26:57.331
I know this is really hard,

26:57.367 --> 27:01.102
but the night Travis was killed,
where were you?

27:01.137 --> 27:03.104
Why are you asking me that?

27:03.139 --> 27:05.339
It's just a formality.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.142
I was at a dance recital in Plattsburg.

27:08.177 --> 27:10.511
I was abroad, studying in Spain.

27:10.546 --> 27:14.114
I dropped out
the week after Travis raped me.

27:14.149 --> 27:16.784
Transferred out of state
the next semester.

27:16.819 --> 27:19.319
I just needed to get
as far away as I could.

27:20.689 --> 27:22.523
But I did follow Sophie's trial,

27:22.558 --> 27:27.360
and I was devastated
when she was convicted.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.528
But he deserves it.

27:28.563 --> 27:29.695
He deserved it.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.998
He deserves to rot in hell.

27:33.668 --> 27:35.335
You're right.

27:35.370 --> 27:37.304
He does.

27:38.773 --> 27:40.807
We found three additional
female Bayside students

27:40.842 --> 27:42.142
victimized by Travis Carter.

27:42.177 --> 27:43.343
Did any of them come forward?

27:43.378 --> 27:44.677
No, they refused because of the way

27:44.712 --> 27:46.412
the university dealt
with Sophie's complaint.

27:46.448 --> 27:49.248
I'm gonna encourage them to file
civil suits against the university.

27:49.283 --> 27:50.550
Hayes, calm down.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.718
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Calm down so I don't have to.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.520
I've already got the university provost

27:54.556 --> 27:55.855
calling me every day.

27:55.890 --> 27:58.390
- Now you're on their side?
- This isn't about sides.

27:58.426 --> 28:01.193
I'm suggesting you focus
on Sophie Hausen's case.

28:01.228 --> 28:04.484
While I turn a blind eye to how
a university protected a rapist?

28:04.509 --> 28:05.898
- They didn't know.
- They knew.

28:05.923 --> 28:07.199
Prove it.

28:08.302 --> 28:09.201
I can't.

28:09.243 --> 28:11.703
Then legally speaking, they didn't know.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.275
Hayes. You sure you're okay?

28:16.310 --> 28:18.018
I am fine. Stop asking.

28:18.043 --> 28:19.578
Stop lying.

28:19.613 --> 28:21.323
You're upset. I can tell.

28:21.571 --> 28:23.548
Talk to me.

28:26.920 --> 28:30.856
The prospect of a university
enabling a serial rapist

28:30.891 --> 28:33.257
upsets me... like it should!

28:33.293 --> 28:34.425
You sure that's it?

28:37.230 --> 28:39.864
I need to go check on the team...

28:39.899 --> 28:42.233
in case they have progress.

28:44.770 --> 28:46.010
All of their alibis checked out.

28:46.039 --> 28:48.439
And all of their stories matched
up with Sophie's word for word.

28:48.475 --> 28:50.741
He flirted with them, then lured
them back to his frat house.

28:50.776 --> 28:51.942
That's where the spiked punch came in.

28:51.978 --> 28:54.612
After they were black-out drunk
or drugged unconscious,

28:54.647 --> 28:55.712
he raped them.

28:55.747 --> 28:57.714
Not so allegedly anymore?

28:57.749 --> 28:59.448
Maya Zapala,
one of our other rape victims...

28:59.484 --> 29:01.217
- What about her?
- I was checking to see

29:01.252 --> 29:03.119
if any of the victims had ever
accused anyone else of rape.

29:03.154 --> 29:04.220
But they weren't lying.

29:04.255 --> 29:06.756
Maya Zapala's dad is Oscar Zapala.

29:06.791 --> 29:08.124
He used to be an enforcer

29:08.159 --> 29:10.326
for the Tres Culebras... brutal guy.

29:10.361 --> 29:12.328
If he found out that Travis
Carter raped his daughter...

29:12.363 --> 29:15.231
I doubt he'd let him live
to tell the tale.

29:23.524 --> 29:24.805
_

29:30.437 --> 29:31.704
You Oscar Zapala?

29:31.738 --> 29:33.538
That depends on who's asking.

29:33.573 --> 29:35.239
Just need a few minutes of your time.

29:35.285 --> 29:36.844
Whatever it is
you think I did, I didn't.

29:36.869 --> 29:39.343
I've been out of Culebras
for a long time.

29:39.379 --> 29:40.711
It's not about a gang incident.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.413
It's about Travis Carter's murder.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.549
Hey, man, I never even met
Travis Carter,

29:44.584 --> 29:47.385
but if I had, I would've had him
sign my Bayside jersey.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.519
You were a fan?

29:48.555 --> 29:50.854
Even after what happened
between him and your daughter?

29:50.890 --> 29:53.557
Travis and Maya used to
hang out. No drama there.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.358
What about when he...

29:58.798 --> 29:59.863
Never mind. Sorry.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.431
- Thank you...
- Wait a minute.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.433
That girl who killed Travis,
she said he raped her.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.235
Is that what this is about?

30:07.606 --> 30:09.372
I-I really... I can't talk...

30:11.076 --> 30:13.110
Did he do this to my kid?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.440
Please tell me that didn't happen.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.249
I'm sorry.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.384
I thought you knew.

30:21.553 --> 30:25.321
I remember she had got depressed
and withdrew for a while.

30:25.356 --> 30:28.925
Then I thought she was just having
trouble adjusting to school.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.295
She didn't say that she had been...

30:35.500 --> 30:38.501
I have to ask.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.503
Where were you
the night Travis was killed?

30:40.539 --> 30:43.272
I was nowhere near Travis.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.475
I'm gonna need proof.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.648
Oscar Zapala's alibi checked out.

30:52.683 --> 30:54.616
He was at work,
on a cleaning crew that night.

30:54.652 --> 30:56.485
Okay, so who's next?

30:56.520 --> 30:59.133
Come on! There has to be something
or someone we can pursue.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.656
I'll grab Maxine, Frankie, and Tess.

31:00.691 --> 31:02.591
We'll go back
through the files... again.

31:14.137 --> 31:15.203
You need a break.

31:15.238 --> 31:17.472
I came home so I could focus. Go away.

31:17.507 --> 31:20.275
What you need to do is un-focus.

31:20.310 --> 31:21.642
Relax.

31:21.667 --> 31:22.842
Neuroscientists say

31:22.867 --> 31:24.712
that the best way
to solve a tough problem

31:24.747 --> 31:26.614
is to focus on something else.

31:26.649 --> 31:29.117
So let your subconscious do the work

31:29.152 --> 31:30.718
while you tell me what's happening

31:30.753 --> 31:32.286
with you and Wallace.

31:32.321 --> 31:33.454
We got into a fight.

31:33.489 --> 31:35.289
- About what?
- Nothing.

31:35.324 --> 31:37.224
The case.

31:37.259 --> 31:38.626
Wasn't really a fight.

31:38.661 --> 31:40.461
Just, um...

31:40.496 --> 31:41.829
It's never gonna work with us.

31:41.864 --> 31:44.665
And you know this because you and
Wallace were arguing over a case,

31:44.701 --> 31:46.734
which is essentially like
breathing for the two of you.

31:46.769 --> 31:49.803
It was... It was weird. It was...

31:49.838 --> 31:51.405
It seemed loaded somehow.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.474
Well, now there's so much more at stake.

31:53.509 --> 31:54.641
I'm not sure about that.

31:54.676 --> 31:55.476
Please!

31:55.511 --> 31:56.610
Wallace isn't interested.

31:56.645 --> 31:57.911
He broke up with Naomi.

31:57.946 --> 32:00.247
I have seen him twice since then,

32:00.282 --> 32:02.282
and he hasn't made a single move

32:02.318 --> 32:04.484
or shown any indication of interest.

32:04.519 --> 32:06.252
You're a moron.

32:06.287 --> 32:09.956
He's a guy, and you're you,
and he knows who you are.

32:09.992 --> 32:13.426
If Wallace was like, "Hayes, I want you.

32:13.461 --> 32:14.504
I've always wanted you,"

32:14.529 --> 32:16.362
then you would go screaming
for the hills.

32:16.397 --> 32:17.897
Not true.

32:19.467 --> 32:20.674
Okay, maybe... true.

32:20.699 --> 32:21.934
I know this isn't going to be easy,

32:21.969 --> 32:24.209
but you're gonna have to put
yourself out there with him.

32:26.374 --> 32:28.141
What if it doesn't work?

32:31.479 --> 32:33.946
I'll be here...
protecting you, like always.

32:39.020 --> 32:40.485
What? What's going on?

32:40.521 --> 32:41.987
She was protecting the girls.

32:42.023 --> 32:42.921
You're amazing.

32:42.957 --> 32:45.323
The neuroscientists aren't bad, either.

32:47.261 --> 32:48.861
Hey. Let me help you with that.

32:48.896 --> 32:50.262
Hey.

32:51.899 --> 32:53.898
Thanks.

32:53.933 --> 32:55.967
Thanks so much for coming by.

32:56.002 --> 32:57.935
Yeah. Text said you needed
to tell me something.

33:00.340 --> 33:03.341
Tess, whatever it is,
it can't be that bad.

33:04.444 --> 33:05.544
I sent you to prison.

33:07.447 --> 33:08.713
My aunt was murdered.

33:08.748 --> 33:10.548
I saw it. I thought it was you.

33:10.583 --> 33:12.383
The police showed me a lineup.

33:12.418 --> 33:14.852
I was... sure.

33:14.888 --> 33:18.556
Her... Her niece testified against me.

33:18.591 --> 33:19.623
That was you?

33:21.761 --> 33:23.360
That's why you came by my cart.

33:24.597 --> 33:25.730
And why you left those tips.

33:25.765 --> 33:27.698
I wanted to see if you were okay.

33:30.035 --> 33:31.535
Tess.

33:31.571 --> 33:32.571
Hayes just called.

33:32.605 --> 33:34.371
We need every bit of information
on Elyse Salmon,

33:34.407 --> 33:35.573
the rape crisis counselor.

33:35.608 --> 33:36.807
Sure. Just give me a minute.

33:39.044 --> 33:39.910
Matty.

33:39.945 --> 33:41.712
Matty!

33:43.381 --> 33:44.848
Elyse knew all the girls' stories.

33:44.883 --> 33:47.250
When the system didn't
protect them, she decided to.

33:47.285 --> 33:49.619
A friend at Special Vics
checked their complaint record.

33:49.654 --> 33:52.689
Elyse Salmon was the victim
of a brutal rape in 1999

33:52.714 --> 33:53.967
before she became a crisis counselor.

33:53.992 --> 33:55.726
Her attacker was never caught.

33:55.761 --> 33:57.794
So she was a victim of rape
and never got any justice.

33:57.830 --> 34:00.029
She became a counselor to help
other people like herself,

34:00.064 --> 34:02.398
and when she found out
what Travis Carter was doing

34:02.434 --> 34:04.701
and that the university wasn't
doing anything to stop it,

34:04.736 --> 34:06.369
she decided to balance the scales...

34:06.404 --> 34:07.503
to protect these girls,

34:07.539 --> 34:10.639
and who knows how many
other girls, from Travis Carter.

34:10.675 --> 34:12.942
The subpoena came through. I got all
of Elyse's credit-card records.

34:12.976 --> 34:14.377
How are her financial records

34:14.411 --> 34:15.945
gonna help us prove
that she shot Travis?

34:15.980 --> 34:18.080
If Frankie's theory is right...
that the killer escaped

34:18.116 --> 34:20.449
over the barbed-wire fence...
she would've been injured.

34:20.484 --> 34:22.618
We know she didn't go to the ER
or the student health center.

34:22.652 --> 34:24.485
Probably means she patched herself up.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.388
Well, her credit-card records
show that she was at a drugstore

34:26.422 --> 34:28.489
in the middle of the night
on April 5, 2013.

34:28.525 --> 34:31.460
No itemization of purchases,
so this is useless.

34:31.495 --> 34:32.793
But this isn't.

34:32.829 --> 34:34.094
A week after Travis was killed,

34:34.130 --> 34:37.632
Elyse hosted a panel discussion
on campus rape.

34:37.668 --> 34:38.766
Look at this photo.

34:42.806 --> 34:44.406
Her arm is bandaged.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.161
That doesn't prove
that she murdered Travis.

34:48.011 --> 34:49.342
But maybe it could.

34:58.876 --> 35:00.266
_

35:01.042 --> 35:03.164
It's a weird time
to be a woman, isn't it?

35:03.189 --> 35:05.250
We can be CEOs, presidents,

35:05.517 --> 35:08.084
and yet, still, we are under siege.

35:08.202 --> 35:11.358
One out of every six women in the U.S.
has been sexually assaulted.

35:11.383 --> 35:13.808
It can start with a smile, a compliment,

35:13.845 --> 35:16.421
an invitation to a campus party.

35:16.904 --> 35:18.714
It's terrifying how common it is.

35:18.975 --> 35:21.651
No wonder you felt the need to
protect Sophie and the others.

35:21.686 --> 35:24.053
I counseled them,
if that's what you mean.

35:24.088 --> 35:25.888
Oh, I think you did
a lot more than that.

35:26.891 --> 35:28.758
In some ways, it's impressive.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.961
Travis Carter was a dangerous man.

35:33.698 --> 35:36.898
But if you really cared about Sophie,

35:36.934 --> 35:38.733
you wouldn't let her go to prison

35:38.769 --> 35:40.335
for a murder you committed.

35:41.805 --> 35:43.672
I-I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

35:43.707 --> 35:45.240
Sure. I can wait outside for the NYPD.

35:47.044 --> 35:48.710
We have a warrant for your DNA

35:48.745 --> 35:50.912
to match the blood
we found on the barbed wire

35:50.948 --> 35:52.146
behind the frat house.

35:54.117 --> 35:56.384
After you shot Travis,

35:56.419 --> 35:59.588
you cut your arm
trying to climb over the fence.

36:00.423 --> 36:02.691
I got locked out of my house.

36:02.726 --> 36:04.593
I had to break a window to get in.

36:06.797 --> 36:09.230
Come clean now,

36:09.265 --> 36:12.066
and I will help you
to get a great attorney.

36:13.136 --> 36:16.270
It shouldn't be hard to get
the right jury on your side.

36:16.306 --> 36:17.871
You stood up for these women.

36:17.907 --> 36:20.108
You did for them
what no one did for you.

36:23.413 --> 36:27.948
Travis was treated like a hero,
even after what he did.

36:27.984 --> 36:30.751
He had no remorse.

36:30.786 --> 36:33.120
He would've kept raping women,
kept ruining their lives.

36:33.155 --> 36:34.788
He would've never stopped.

36:34.824 --> 36:36.223
So you killed him.

36:37.159 --> 36:37.825
Yes.

36:37.860 --> 36:38.860
What about Sophie?

36:42.331 --> 36:45.232
I thought she'd get off.

36:45.267 --> 36:47.867
Innocent people
aren't supposed to go to prison.

36:52.141 --> 36:54.307
Who are you calling?

36:54.343 --> 36:56.143
NYPD.

36:56.178 --> 36:57.944
I don't really have a warrant.

36:59.881 --> 37:01.347
And now I don't need one.

37:07.321 --> 37:09.689
How long do you think
Elyse will go away for?

37:09.724 --> 37:10.422
Maybe she won't.

37:10.458 --> 37:11.357
Killing a serial rapist

37:11.392 --> 37:13.425
has "jury nullification"
written all over it.

37:13.461 --> 37:15.294
If that's justice, it sucks.

37:15.329 --> 37:16.228
The guy raped four girls.

37:16.264 --> 37:18.164
And the woman who killed him
sat in silence

37:18.199 --> 37:20.166
while one of those girls
spent four years in prison.

37:20.201 --> 37:21.433
Heard that.

37:28.176 --> 37:30.308
I told Matty the truth.

37:30.343 --> 37:31.877
Yeah?

37:31.912 --> 37:32.878
That's good.

37:32.913 --> 37:34.046
How'd he take it?

37:34.081 --> 37:35.914
I don't know. He just walked away.

37:37.051 --> 37:38.016
I'm sorry.

37:38.052 --> 37:41.053
But... you did it.

37:41.088 --> 37:42.721
You know, you owned up to it.

37:42.756 --> 37:45.290
Then why do I feel so terrible?

37:50.930 --> 37:52.997
This is where our brand-new,

37:53.032 --> 37:56.901
state-of-the-art training
facility will be located...

37:56.936 --> 38:00.238
made possible by the generosity of you,

38:00.273 --> 38:02.807
our illustrious donors and alums.

38:02.842 --> 38:04.728
- Excuse me, Provost Chambers.
- Yes.

38:04.753 --> 38:07.211
I just want to compliment you
on all your hard work

38:07.246 --> 38:09.880
covering up the sexual assaults
committed by your athletes.

38:09.916 --> 38:11.283
Hey, aren't you Hayes Morrison?

38:11.308 --> 38:13.751
Ms. Morrison, would you like
to discuss this in private?

38:13.786 --> 38:16.253
I would prefer an audience...
like the one that you had

38:16.288 --> 38:18.823
when you discredited
Sophie Hausen, thus assuring

38:18.858 --> 38:21.891
that other victimized women
wouldn't dare come forward,

38:21.927 --> 38:24.328
which allowed Travis Carter
to continue raping women.

38:24.363 --> 38:26.263
Meanwhile, you stood by and did nothing.

38:26.298 --> 38:29.833
Congratulations on terrorizing
your entire female student body.

38:29.868 --> 38:30.900
Enjoy your legacy.

38:41.947 --> 38:44.513
We don't usually see you here
for this part.

38:44.549 --> 38:46.950
I wanted to make sure Sophie was okay.

38:54.592 --> 38:57.526
Even now, she has a long road ahead.

38:57.562 --> 39:00.229
Well, at least
she doesn't have to go it alone.

39:08.139 --> 39:09.437
Maya.

39:16.247 --> 39:17.946
Brave women.

39:38.268 --> 39:39.768
I want in.

39:41.037 --> 39:42.469
On...?

39:42.505 --> 39:43.604
Us.

39:43.639 --> 39:45.472
You and me.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.241
All of it.

39:47.277 --> 39:48.442
For real this time.

39:50.546 --> 39:51.779
Me too.

39:54.517 --> 39:57.451
I have no idea how to do this,
especially working together.

39:57.486 --> 39:59.086
I don't know how I'm not gonna freak out

39:59.121 --> 40:00.921
or blow you off or...

40:00.956 --> 40:02.989
or... or screw it up in some way.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.958
Me neither.

40:06.962 --> 40:08.995
I'm up for the challenge, though.

40:10.633 --> 40:12.433
You?

40:12.468 --> 40:13.634
Yeah.

40:15.170 --> 40:16.602
Yes.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.486
What now?

40:35.882 --> 40:37.177
I have no idea.
