[ Gasping ]

00:51.331 --> 00:55.199
[Shouting, indistinct]

00:55.268 --> 00:58.203
Come on.
Move around towards shore.

02:24.024 --> 02:26.117
[Scully]
Get down!

02:32.466 --> 02:35.401
Get down
Stay down!

02:37.003 --> 02:39.494
You're gonna keep breathing.
Do you hear me?

02:43.443 --> 02:46.310
[ Grunting ]

02:49.950 --> 02:51.781
I'll be right back.

02:52.986 --> 02:55.352
Back away.
Back aw--

03:03.396 --> 03:05.296
[Sirens Blaring]

03:12.639 --> 03:14.869
I need an EMT in here now.

03:14.941 --> 03:17.876
Car 39 requesting EMT.

03:23.283 --> 03:26.047
Come on, now.
Let her through.
Let her through.

03:26.119 --> 03:28.849
- Okay.
- Help me with this table.
Give her some room.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.160
We've got paramedics on the way.
You're going to the hospital.

03:37.230 --> 03:39.596
You're going to be okay.

03:39.666 --> 03:41.827
We still haven't celebrated
my birthday, Pendrill.

03:41.902 --> 03:43.927
I'm not going to let you
off the hook like this.

03:47.107 --> 03:51.476
Let 'em through.
Let 'em through, please.

03:51.545 --> 03:54.912
This man has a puncture wound
to his right lung. He needs
to be intubated immediately.

03:54.981 --> 03:56.915
You got it.

04:01.855 --> 04:05.723
He's an FBI agent,
and he's not gonna die.

04:18.971 --> 04:20.906
Sit down.

04:22.976 --> 04:25.274
I'm sorry.

04:25.345 --> 04:27.279
How did they know?

04:27.347 --> 04:29.781
When you talked
to your girlfriend,
what did you say?

04:31.618 --> 04:35.019
- Did you tell her
you were in D.C.?
- No.

04:35.088 --> 04:37.113
Then there's someone inside.

04:37.190 --> 04:40.956
- [Man]...three, lift.
- [Indistinct]

04:58.545 --> 05:01.844
- What happened?
Who shot Pendrill?
- I don't know.

05:01.915 --> 05:04.247
I got a call
about a federal witness
being transferred.

05:04.317 --> 05:08.879
It's Sergeant Louis Frish.
He was the intended target.

05:08.955 --> 05:11.219
There was supposed to be
a federal marshal here...

05:11.324 --> 05:14.088
to put the sergeant
into protective custody.

05:14.194 --> 05:16.685
- That order was countermanded.
- By whom?

05:16.796 --> 05:20.391
- Louis Frish is being
put under military arrest.
- Military arrest?

05:20.467 --> 05:24.369
For suspicion of murder
and providing false testimony
in a federal investigation.

05:24.437 --> 05:27.065
He has testimony that
is damaging to the military.

05:27.140 --> 05:30.371
His life is in danger.
He is not going anywhere.

05:30.443 --> 05:34.504
The order to arrest this man
came out of the Office of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

05:34.581 --> 05:36.947
who have also issued
a recommendation
on Agent Mulder.

05:37.017 --> 05:38.985
For what?

05:39.052 --> 05:42.044
Agent Mulder's also been put
under military arrest...

05:42.122 --> 05:44.283
on charges of interference
with a military investigation...

05:44.391 --> 05:46.484
into a crash
of a commercial airliner.

05:46.593 --> 05:49.653
The military is responsible
for the downing of that plane.

05:49.763 --> 05:53.199
They are admitting as much.

05:53.299 --> 05:55.267
Sergeant Frish's story
is not the one they're telling.

05:55.335 --> 05:57.803
What is their story?

06:12.986 --> 06:17.446
I have a responsibility
for the safety of the agents
under my supervision.

06:17.557 --> 06:20.025
I'm not going to put
another agent's life in jeopardy...

06:20.126 --> 06:23.562
just to keep her
out in the field.

06:23.630 --> 06:26.155
I'm fine.

06:26.232 --> 06:29.793
I suggest you make sure of that
when you go to the hospital
with Agent Pendrill.

06:47.620 --> 06:50.384
- I came to talk to you.
- About what?

06:50.457 --> 06:53.426
A big ol' misunderstanding?

06:55.495 --> 06:58.623
According to the military,
there was no misunderstanding.

06:58.698 --> 07:01.292
So all of the sudden
they just decide
to take responsibility...

07:01.367 --> 07:03.562
for the crash of Flight 549?

07:03.636 --> 07:06.628
They had no choice.
Not in light of all the facts
that have come out.

07:06.706 --> 07:09.766
Facts? Have you heard
their cover story:

07:09.843 --> 07:12.812
that the control tower
gave bad coordinates
to a fighter pilot...

07:12.879 --> 07:16.815
causing it to collide with Flight 549
over military airspace?

07:16.883 --> 07:20.114
They allowed me
to listen to the recordings.

07:20.186 --> 07:22.882
If you believe
in the coordinates
that Sergeant Frish...

07:22.956 --> 07:24.890
gave to the fighter pilot...

07:24.991 --> 07:28.085
were the exact path
that549 was on.

07:28.194 --> 07:30.128
Now, they would indicate
that Sergeant Frish
and his co-controller...

07:30.196 --> 07:34.292
could not have seen
Flight 549 in the airspace
until it was too late.

07:34.367 --> 07:37.632
So they're saying
the tower put those jets
on a collision course.

07:37.704 --> 07:41.572
Yes. And that they were
the only two aircraft
on the radar screen.

07:41.641 --> 07:46.101
Realizing his guilt,
Sergeant Frish's fellow
officer put a gun to his head.

07:46.179 --> 07:51.139
According to the air force,
Sergeant Frish lied
to save himself.

07:51.217 --> 07:54.550
When he found out
that his fellow officer
committed suicide,

07:54.621 --> 07:57.351
he came to us
to blame the military.

07:57.457 --> 08:00.483
That's why they pursued him,
to bring him to justice.

08:00.593 --> 08:03.153
And they could conveniently
lay the blame on a dead man.

08:03.263 --> 08:05.458
Yes.

08:07.233 --> 08:10.464
This, uh, second plane,

08:10.537 --> 08:12.471
they say it's
a military fighter?

08:12.539 --> 08:16.066
It was an F-1 5 Eagle, according
to an air force spokesman.

08:16.142 --> 08:18.576
You believe that story, Scully?

08:19.879 --> 08:22.507
I don't know what to believe.

08:23.716 --> 08:26.583
Do you believe I got this
from an F-1 5 Eagle?

08:26.653 --> 08:29.747
Those look like radiation burns.
Where did you get that?

08:29.823 --> 08:31.950
At the second crash site...

08:32.058 --> 08:34.958
in about 50 feet of water
at the bottom of Sacandaga Lake.

08:35.028 --> 08:37.188
- You found it?
- Mm-hmm. I followed
a trail of bubbles...

08:37.297 --> 08:40.857
down to a wreckage that didn't
look like anything that might
take off from an air force base.

08:40.933 --> 08:42.765
What was it?

08:42.836 --> 08:45.862
What collided with Flight 549
was a UFO...

08:45.939 --> 08:49.272
shot down by the military,
taking the passenger plane
right along with it.

08:49.342 --> 08:52.178
Except it can't be proven.

08:52.178 --> 08:53.167
Except it can't be proven.

08:53.913 --> 08:57.405
- Why not?
- Because they haven't been able
to find any physical evidence...

08:57.483 --> 09:00.043
that Flight 549
was involved in a collision.

09:00.119 --> 09:04.021
- According to who?
- Mike Malar, the I.I.C., the man
running the investigation.

09:04.090 --> 09:06.024
- How do you know he's not lying?
- I don't.

09:06.092 --> 09:09.186
He seems to be the one man
who truly wants to figure out
what downed that plane,

09:09.262 --> 09:12.561
and who came to me
with information
he had no reason to share.

09:12.632 --> 09:14.566
What information?

09:14.667 --> 09:17.795
He found Sharon Graffia
wandering in a daze
at the crash site...

09:17.904 --> 09:21.340
the night we left
after seeing lights
over the area.

09:21.441 --> 09:23.671
- Max Fennig's sister.
- That's another thing, Mulder.

09:23.743 --> 09:27.645
- She's not Max Fennig's sister.
- Well, who is she?

09:27.714 --> 09:29.773
She's an unemployed
aeronautical engineer...

09:29.849 --> 09:32.409
who spent time in and out
of mental institutions.

09:32.485 --> 09:34.419
That's where she met Max.

09:34.487 --> 09:37.285
- Why would she lie?
- I don't know.

09:38.892 --> 09:42.589
All I know is that this plane
seems to be killing people...

09:42.662 --> 09:44.721
as it sits there
on the ground.

09:46.633 --> 09:49.466
Mulder,
Agent Pendrill is dead.

09:52.705 --> 09:57.369
- How?
- Shot in an attempt
on Sergeant Frish in Washington.

09:59.679 --> 10:03.115
He saved his life, Mulder,
and maybe mine.

10:05.685 --> 10:07.619
All right, Scully.
Scully?

10:08.755 --> 10:11.781
Mulder, what are
these people dying for?

10:11.858 --> 10:15.988
- Is it for the truth or for the lies?
- It's gotta be for the truth.

10:17.730 --> 10:21.928
If we owe them anything,
it's to make sure of that.

10:23.703 --> 10:25.898
Excuse me, sir.
Max Fennig?

10:26.005 --> 10:27.939
- He's over there.
- Thank you.

10:40.753 --> 10:42.687
Remember this place?

10:44.257 --> 10:48.557
I remember being amazed
at what some people will call home.

10:48.628 --> 10:51.927
You have to admit, the man had
an enduring sense of style.

10:51.998 --> 10:57.300
- Only Max Fennig and you would
appreciate living like this.
- [Laughs]

11:05.078 --> 11:10.015
# Unmarked helicopters #

11:10.083 --> 11:13.052
# Hovering ##

11:13.119 --> 11:18.113
I think you were actually
kindred spirits
in some deep, strange way.

11:18.191 --> 11:20.625
What do you mean?

11:20.693 --> 11:23.218
Men with Spartan lives,
simple in
their creature comforts,

11:23.296 --> 11:26.788
if only to allow
for the complexity of their passions.

11:26.866 --> 11:29.164
Mm, beans and weenies.

11:29.268 --> 11:31.736
What exactly are we looking for
here, Mulder?

11:31.838 --> 11:34.671
Something to explain what
Max was doing on that plane.

11:34.741 --> 11:36.675
What he was coming to show me
or tell me.

11:36.743 --> 11:39.234
What makes you think
that he was coming to see you?

11:40.346 --> 11:42.280
Max is the key to all this.

11:42.348 --> 11:44.816
He knew that plane was in danger
even before it took off,

11:44.884 --> 11:46.818
before it entered
military airspace.

11:46.886 --> 11:49.480
Now, how would he know that,

11:49.555 --> 11:51.489
and what would be worth
taking that risk?

12:03.703 --> 12:06.365
Hi. Max here,

12:06.472 --> 12:08.406
but of course.

12:08.474 --> 12:11.102
This is, uh,
well, quite obviously my story,

12:11.177 --> 12:13.975
since I'm telling it.

12:14.047 --> 12:17.539
Anyway, um, for those of you
who know me already...

12:17.617 --> 12:21.212
this is going to be ancient
history, but for the rest of you
this is--

12:21.287 --> 12:23.881
well, what can I say--
the story of my life.

12:23.956 --> 12:27.392
All I ever wanted in life
was to be left alone.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.394
[ Scoffs ]
Don't we all.

12:29.462 --> 12:34.229
Uh, so just my luck
that I'd eventually
become an alien abductee.

12:34.300 --> 12:39.636
Now I'm never alone. Any minute
when I'm least expecting it--

12:39.705 --> 12:43.300
And the worst part is
no one believes you.

12:43.409 --> 12:46.344
Oh, well, almost no one.

12:46.412 --> 12:51.714
So, I've devoted my life
to providing all you
disbelievers with proof.

12:51.784 --> 12:56.585
Proof that
there are extraterrestrial,
biological entities right now...

12:56.656 --> 13:00.854
visiting our planet
in alien ships for purposes
of a troubling agenda...

13:00.927 --> 13:04.021
known only to certain members
of government, the FBI...

13:04.097 --> 13:07.624
and certain high-ranking members
of the military industrial
community...

13:07.700 --> 13:10.362
who have recovered
some of these very craft.

13:10.470 --> 13:14.804
Not that they’d ever
admit to it publicly, of course.

13:14.874 --> 13:19.243
Nor would they admit
that they have salvaged
some of this alien technology...

13:19.312 --> 13:21.746
and are using it
in military applications.

13:21.814 --> 13:24.510
No, that would be un-American.
And they won't admit it until...

13:24.584 --> 13:29.988
someone confronts them
with irrefutable,
undeniable proof.

13:30.056 --> 13:32.684
Some one like me.

13:32.758 --> 13:35.989
And, uh, I should probably
mention that I do this...

13:36.062 --> 13:38.360
at great risk
to my own health and safety.

13:38.431 --> 13:41.332
But hey, when every day's
just another day,

13:41.400 --> 13:44.733
you're gonna get kidnapped
by a bunch of little gray dudes
from outer space,

13:44.837 --> 13:47.772
what’s a few CIA spooks
to worry about?

14:00.920 --> 14:02.785
[Man]
Careful.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.694
[ Gagging ]

14:37.490 --> 14:40.926
- [ Gasps ]
- We found it.

14:46.532 --> 14:48.466
[Man]
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:48.534 --> 14:52.231
recovery and identification
of the deceased victims
in Flight549...

14:52.305 --> 14:54.933
is at 76%.

14:55.007 --> 14:56.975
Which is far better
than anticipated,

14:57.043 --> 15:01.480
given the kind of destruction
that we've all seen.

15:01.547 --> 15:04.641
We've got a total
of nearly 3,000 man-hours
logged already...

15:04.717 --> 15:08.278
in this first wave
of investigation.

15:08.387 --> 15:13.347
And I wish I could tell
you folks that we've come up
with something more concrete.

15:13.459 --> 15:17.623
But the evidence...

15:17.697 --> 15:20.530
just doesn't support
anything more conclusive...

15:20.600 --> 15:24.127
than the air force's assertion
that the cause of this crash...

15:24.203 --> 15:28.765
was a midair collision
or a catastrophic near-miss.

15:37.483 --> 15:40.646
I'm gonna ask you all
to wrap up your reports tonight.

15:40.753 --> 15:43.347
And then I want you
to go home to your families.

15:43.456 --> 15:47.950
You've done a good
and thorough job here.

15:48.060 --> 15:52.497
You'll be in touch with me
or someone from the N.T.S.B.
on anything further.

15:53.833 --> 15:58.270
I just wanted to thank you all
personally. Thank you.

15:58.337 --> 16:01.670
[ Quiet Chatter]

16:12.985 --> 16:15.249
I'd wondered
what happened to you.

16:15.354 --> 16:18.118
- I'd put in a call.
- You had something
you wanted to tell us?

16:18.190 --> 16:21.557
No. Just--
Just wanted to touch base.

16:21.627 --> 16:25.358
Thank you for your help
in leading us to the fact
of the military's involvement.

16:25.431 --> 16:28.958
I think the facts are
still a matter of speculation,
Mr. Malar.

16:29.035 --> 16:31.970
Listening to what you just said,
I think you do too.

16:32.038 --> 16:35.496
The military's public claim
of fault for the collision...

16:35.574 --> 16:39.510
and their covert actions
to promote that claim
have raised some suspicions.

16:39.578 --> 16:41.341
Suspicions? Of what?

16:41.414 --> 16:43.541
That the story the military
is now promoting...

16:43.616 --> 16:46.983
is a convenience deflection
and cover-up.

16:47.086 --> 16:49.520
- Of what?
- Agent Scully and I agree
on some of the motives,

16:49.588 --> 16:51.419
but not exactly on the facts.

16:51.490 --> 16:54.254
- Do you have facts that I don't?
- No, but I do have a story...

16:54.327 --> 16:56.261
if you’re willing to hear it.

16:56.329 --> 16:59.059
Feel free to tell me it's bull,
as Agent Scully has,

16:59.131 --> 17:01.827
but I think it's as believable
as any story I've heard.

17:01.901 --> 17:04.926
At least it's the only one
that can't be refuted by the facts.

17:12.178 --> 17:14.839
All right.

17:14.914 --> 17:17.940
There was one man who knew
what brought this plane down.

17:18.017 --> 17:21.180
And he knew it even before

35:15.059 --> 35:18.187
It's an alien energy source,
isn't it?

35:18.263 --> 35:21.323
What is it, cold fusion,
over-unity energy?

35:21.433 --> 35:24.630
What could be worth
killing all those passengers
on Flight 549?

35:24.736 --> 35:28.194
The cause of that crash
has been determined
as human error.

35:28.306 --> 35:30.604
And I'm gonna see you
pay for that error,

35:30.675 --> 35:35.271
along with you and your employer
and the government
that finances its contracts.

35:35.346 --> 35:38.611
Now, I want you to stand up
very slowly and move
to the back of the plane.

35:38.683 --> 35:40.617
We're gonna go
to the bathroom.

35:43.188 --> 35:45.122
Move.

36:25.864 --> 36:28.389
[Cell phone Ringing]

36:28.500 --> 36:30.434
- [ Beeps ]
- Scully.

36:30.502 --> 36:32.970
- Hey, Scully. It's me.
- Mulder, where are you?

36:33.037 --> 36:34.971
I'm standing outside
an airplane bathroom...

36:35.039 --> 36:37.507
where I've got the man
who shot Pendrill locked up.

36:37.575 --> 36:40.635
- What?
- It looks like I'm gonna miss
the in-flight movie.

36:40.712 --> 36:42.646
It was something starring
Steve Guttenberg.

36:42.714 --> 36:45.308
Mulder, did you get on
the flight that you said
you were getting on?

36:45.383 --> 36:47.544
Yeah. Everything's going
according to plan.

36:47.619 --> 36:49.553
I think you should
alert Skinner anyway.

36:49.621 --> 36:51.953
I don't want to take any chances
getting this guy off the plane.

36:52.023 --> 36:54.685
- I don't think you do either.
- Right.

36:58.396 --> 37:01.490
- Hey, Scully.
My watch just stopped.
- Yeah?

37:01.599 --> 37:04.659
What? Mulder?
Mulder?

37:05.870 --> 37:08.202
Excuse me.
I'm a federal agent.

37:08.273 --> 37:12.004
I want you to listen to me
very carefully. This plane is
about to be intercepted.

37:12.076 --> 37:14.374
- Intercepted?
- Intercepted, engaged
and boarded.

37:14.445 --> 37:17.437
I want you to tell the captain
to initiate evasive maneuvers
immediately.

37:17.515 --> 37:20.382
put the bag down!

37:20.451 --> 37:23.113
[ Passengers Screaming ]

37:23.187 --> 37:25.553
Put it down on the floor.

37:48.880 --> 37:51.678
[ All Screaming ]

38:24.449 --> 38:26.940
Drop the bag!

38:27.018 --> 38:29.578
Drop the bag.
Drop it!

38:39.464 --> 38:42.956
Hey, let it go!

38:43.034 --> 38:45.229
Let it go!

39:21.105 --> 39:23.938
Mulder, where is he?

39:24.008 --> 39:26.101
He's not here.

39:26.210 --> 39:28.144
What do you mean?

39:28.212 --> 39:30.680
You said you had him
on this plane. You said
you had what Max Fennig had.

39:30.782 --> 39:33.012
The stolen part.

39:34.585 --> 39:37.053
What time do you have?

39:37.121 --> 39:39.214
1 0:56.

39:45.763 --> 39:49.028
Would you like to tell me
what's going on here,
Agent Mulder?

39:49.100 --> 39:52.831
I don't think you want
to know the answer.

40:03.815 --> 40:06.750
- [ Sighs ]
- Is this man on the plane?

40:09.654 --> 40:14.353
I think he got
the connecting flight.

40:14.425 --> 40:16.859
[Max]
But nobody ever finds out about it.

40:16.928 --> 40:20.364
There are scientists in Finland
right now who say they have
detected antigravity...

40:20.431 --> 40:23.832
over the surface of a spinning
superconducting disk.

40:23.901 --> 40:27.598
Technology that is supposedly
20 or 30 years down the road,

40:27.705 --> 40:29.639
like over-unity energy.

40:29.707 --> 40:33.905
Um, massless displacement
current from cold fusion
we need for space travel.

40:33.978 --> 40:36.139
I know,
thanks to my inside sources,

40:36.214 --> 40:39.149
that this technology,
in fact, exists.

40:39.217 --> 40:43.813
I've seen military aircraft
that use it hovering
right over my trailer.

40:43.888 --> 40:46.880
Why is the U.S. Government
keeping all this a secret?

40:46.958 --> 40:50.860
I intend to expose
these facts to the people.

40:50.928 --> 40:52.896
I mean, I'm just one man.

40:55.133 --> 40:57.931
These tapes,
you don't mind if I keep them?

40:58.002 --> 41:01.096
No. I think you should
consider yourself the sole curator...

41:01.205 --> 41:05.335
of the Max Fennig Rolling
Multimedia Library and Archive.

41:05.443 --> 41:08.139
You should probably
get tax-exempt status
as soon as you can.

41:08.212 --> 41:10.146
This stuff could be
worth something someday.

41:12.784 --> 41:15.844
I wanna thank you
for helping me out,
for all you've done.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.048
Max would have
wanted it that way.

41:19.123 --> 41:21.057
You lost somebody
very close to you.

41:21.125 --> 41:23.025
So did you.

41:45.683 --> 41:49.244
You thinking
about Pendrill?

41:49.320 --> 41:53.120
I realized I didn't even
know his first name.

41:55.393 --> 41:58.954
I actually
was thinking about, uh,

41:59.030 --> 42:02.056
this gift that you gave me
for my birthday.

42:02.133 --> 42:06.365
You never got to tell me
why you gave it to me
or what it means.

42:06.437 --> 42:09.406
But I think I know.

42:11.976 --> 42:16.845
I think that you appreciated
that there are extraordinary
men and women...

42:16.914 --> 42:20.247
and extraordinary moments...

42:20.318 --> 42:24.516
when history leaps forward
on the backs
of these individuals.

42:24.589 --> 42:29.583
That what can be imagined
can be achieved.

42:29.660 --> 42:32.561
That you must dare to dream.

42:32.630 --> 42:37.397
But that there's no substitute
for perseverance and hard work...

42:37.468 --> 42:39.902
and teamwork.

42:39.971 --> 42:43.429
Because no one gets there alone.

42:45.109 --> 42:48.909
And that while we commemorate
the-the greatness of these events...

42:48.980 --> 42:50.914
and the individuals
who achieve them,

42:50.982 --> 42:54.349
we cannot forget
the sacrifice of those...

42:54.418 --> 42:57.854
who make these achievements
and leaps possible.

43:00.758 --> 43:03.522
I just thought it was
a pretty cool key chain.
