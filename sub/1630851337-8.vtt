to the knockouts!

01:05.332 --> 01:09.169
I love Jershika's voice.
It's so soulful, so powerful.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.370
Kelly, you better watch out.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.539

I love her.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.721
You're so good at
that stuff, man.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.656
I still have my steal,

01:29.656 --> 01:33.360
and I think the right thing will
happen when it's supposed to.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.628
90 seconds out.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.497

I'm really excited.

Yeah, nice to meet you.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.405
If I could have my pick

02:51.405 --> 02:53.507
of another male country artist
to be in the room,

I would have picked
Dierks Bentley.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.244
Your version of "Hole in the
Bottle" was so good.

Nice to meet you.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.349
Only being 15, I mean,
working with Blake Shelton

03:02.349 --> 03:04.251
and Dierks Bentley,
that's a dream.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.652
Dierks, I sang
"Drunk on a Plane"

03:05.652 --> 03:07.287
when I was singing
on cruise ships,

03:07.287 --> 03:08.655
but it was
"Drunk on a Ship."

03:08.655 --> 03:10.591
That's amazing. It's a great way
to cut your teeth.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.359
I took a gig on a cruise ship
early in my career.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.528
I had like six days off
that whole year.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.264
I don't want you to
ever have to sing on a
cruise ship ever again.

03:17.264 --> 03:20.501
Let's get you off
the boat, on the stage.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.470
I did cruise ships for
2 1/2 years.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.406
We would learn 300 to 400 songs,

03:26.406 --> 03:30.444
and we would do four hours
pretty consistently at night.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.546
I'm really grateful
for all of that.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.515
I really believe that
cruise ships

03:34.515 --> 03:36.250
prepared me for "The Voice."

03:36.250 --> 03:38.418
Maren Morris.
Maren's my favorite.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.622
So Blake gave us "Girl"
by Maren Morris.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.490
I can't believe
this is happening.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.292
That's incredible record.
Yeah.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.194
That's how I felt
about "Hillbilly Bone"

03:47.194 --> 03:48.462
when I released it.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.531
What was your favorite line,
Blake?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.599
♪ Bone ba‐bone ba‐bone ♪
Uh ♪ Bone ba‐bone bone bone ♪

03:52.599 --> 03:54.334
It's the easiest to remember.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.637
Lyrically, I think that
nailed it.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.472
On the Country Music Songwriting
Hall of Fame,

03:58.472 --> 04:02.476
they're actually carving,
"Red, red, red."

04:02.476 --> 04:04.378
Red, red, red.
This is a cool pairing

04:04.378 --> 04:06.680
with this song,
I think, because Maren is, like,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.383
as pop as it gets
in country music right now.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.584
I feel blessed
that we have this song...

04:10.584 --> 04:13.020
Yeah, yeah.
...because we get to sing

04:13.020 --> 04:14.621
about empowering
each other.
It's like, yeah,

04:17.291 --> 04:21.361
I'm not used
to singing pop country,

04:21.361 --> 04:24.731
and Lana has
a powerful country voice.

04:24.731 --> 04:28.368
But this song,
it's about uplifting each other.

04:28.368 --> 04:31.238
I think that's what
I kind of do back home.

04:31.238 --> 04:34.007
I've been playing football
since I was five years old.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.609
I am the only female on my team.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.644
I will say my mom
was a little scared

04:37.644 --> 04:40.214
because she didn't want
her little girl getting hurt.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.548
But that first time
I stepped out

04:41.548 --> 04:45.252
and took that first hit,
I was hooked.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.187
I actually had
this little girl once say,

04:47.187 --> 04:49.489
"I want to be just like you."

04:49.489 --> 04:51.525
Just knowing that
there was someone out there

04:51.525 --> 04:54.561

it was ‐‐ it was really sweet.

sound in female voices anymore.

05:13.247 --> 05:14.681

and she's so talented.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.756
Can't believe ‐‐ What were you
doin' when you were 15?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.658
I had glasses
and a mullet.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.160
Oh, goodness.
I've seen those pictures.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.595
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:28.595 --> 05:31.331
Hailey, your voice
has got this attack.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.169
You kinda sing like you play
football, the intensity level,

05:35.169 --> 05:37.738
it seems like you got it pegged
out on 10 right now, you know?

05:37.738 --> 05:40.607
And there's parts of the song
that that's perfect

05:40.607 --> 05:42.509
and brilliant and awesome,
and then there's parts of it

05:42.509 --> 05:44.645
that I think you might be able
to dial it back.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.281
And, Lana, there's a presence
that you have

05:47.281 --> 05:49.483
that just puts
everybody in here at ease.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.451
Mm‐hmm.
She lays way back behind

05:51.451 --> 05:53.320
the phrasing, it's so cool.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.222
You're almost laid
so far back

05:55.222 --> 05:57.658
that she almost has to come in
on top of you.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.660
You got to give her some room
to get in there, you know?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.795
Totally.
So just keep that in mind.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.198
I mean, these are two
of my favorite voices
I've heard so far.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.699
It's a nice dichotomy?
Is that right?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.534
Dichotomy?
Big word
for a country singer.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.603
Seemed really comfortable.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.371
If you can do it in here,
you can do it anywhere.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.639
Both these girls,
they got that thing

06:12.639 --> 06:14.241
that you can't put
your finger on,

06:14.241 --> 06:16.043
and they have it
in totally different ways.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.511

on the show.

09:56.950 --> 09:58.752
Just to see
you putting everything

09:58.752 --> 10:01.721
into every single note,
it felt so good.

10:01.721 --> 10:03.089
Thank you.

10:03.089 --> 10:04.958
Lana,
I really love your tone.

10:04.958 --> 10:07.527
I think there's a lot
of subtlety to it.

10:07.527 --> 10:09.796
I like that songbird quality.

10:09.796 --> 10:11.598
I don't think
this is an easy decision.

10:11.598 --> 10:13.800
They're completely
different vocalists.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.669
You couldn't go wrong
either way.
Yeah.

10:17.837 --> 10:19.973
I actually think it's a perfect
song for both of you.

10:19.973 --> 10:22.075
Lana, you held your own
because all the big notes,

10:22.075 --> 10:23.877
it was so beautiful,
especially at the end.

10:23.877 --> 10:25.178
You pierced through
in a different way.

10:25.178 --> 10:27.847
Hailey, you were a cheetah
and someone was like

10:27.847 --> 10:29.983
just taming you
or like trying to hold you back.

10:29.983 --> 10:32.886
I'm so interested in what
the cheetah has to offer,

10:32.886 --> 10:35.655
but if you pick Lana,
she's badass.

10:35.655 --> 10:37.724
Not a lot of people are
stylists, and I think you are.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.092
Thank you so much.

10:39.092 --> 10:41.127
You both were so amazing,

10:41.127 --> 10:44.931
and I enjoyed the different
textures, and it was exciting.

10:44.931 --> 10:48.201
Lana, your voice
is so pure and sweet

10:48.201 --> 10:51.705
and has a totally different
energy than Hailey's,

10:51.705 --> 10:55.141
and yours is so colorful
and raw and rock 'n' roll.

10:55.141 --> 10:58.778
It's not an easy thing here
that you're dealing with, Blake.

10:58.778 --> 11:02.115
Thank you, Coaches.

11:02.115 --> 11:04.117
Alright, Blake.
Final decision's yours, buddy.

11:04.117 --> 11:05.752
Give us some thoughts
on the battle first.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.154
Hailey literally plays

11:08.154 --> 11:12.826
outside linebacker for her
high‐school football team.

11:12.826 --> 11:14.794
That's so...tight.

11:14.794 --> 11:16.830
Now you know why
she sings like that.

11:16.830 --> 11:19.633
You can't hold the ‐‐ You can't
hold back the cheetah.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.101
She's like, "Get out of my way!"
You can't hold her back.

11:21.101 --> 11:24.638
And believe it or not, that was
actually Hailey dialed back.

11:24.638 --> 11:27.641
And then, Lana,
you have this very completely

11:27.641 --> 11:29.809
opposite voice from what
Hailey has ‐‐

11:29.809 --> 11:32.579
a very sweet tone,
very country.

11:32.579 --> 11:34.614
It's two different
points of view.

11:34.614 --> 11:37.083
So thank both of you guys
for all the hard work.

11:38.852 --> 11:40.887
Blake,
you got a tough one here.

11:40.887 --> 11:43.890
Who is the winner
of this battle?

11:43.890 --> 11:47.093
This is my least favorite
part of the show

11:47.093 --> 11:49.562
'cause I just can't
take doing this, but...

11:54.134 --> 11:56.803
The winner of this battle
is Hailey.

11:56.803 --> 12:00.206
Hailey, congratulations. You're
moving on to the knockouts!

12:00.206 --> 12:02.709
The thing that
intrigues me about Hailey

12:02.709 --> 12:06.846
is that she's so young
and her voice is so powerful.

12:06.846 --> 12:09.816
From a coaching standpoint,
she has all the elements.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.953
She just needs to know how to
approach an actual performance

12:12.953 --> 12:14.888
and ‐‐ and have some dynamics.

12:14.888 --> 12:16.856
I'm looking forward
to workin' on those things.

12:16.856 --> 12:19.059
Did you hear me screamin'?!
Yes, I heard you screaming.

12:19.059 --> 12:20.894
Yes! Like the side of
a football field.

12:20.894 --> 12:22.796
Go, go, go, go, go.
Yes, I heard you.

12:22.796 --> 12:24.097
That's exactly
like the football field.

12:24.097 --> 12:26.199
Coaches, let me remind you

12:26.199 --> 12:28.668
that Lana's available
to steal or save.

12:28.668 --> 12:30.804
Lana, anything you want
to say to Blake?

12:30.804 --> 12:33.573
It's been a blessing that
you turned your chair for me.

12:33.573 --> 12:35.942
My life has changed,
so thank you.

12:35.942 --> 12:38.945
Give it up for Lana Scott one
more time, ladies and gentlemen!

12:43.850 --> 12:46.686
Wait a minute, Lana!
You're not going anywhere.

12:47.721 --> 12:49.122
We've got a save!

12:49.122 --> 12:51.057
Blake Shelton
uses his only save...

12:51.057 --> 12:53.693
Get your ass back on
that stage!

12:53.693 --> 12:54.828
...for Lana Scott!

12:57.130 --> 12:58.164
Alright.

12:58.164 --> 13:00.066
I love the saves!

13:00.066 --> 13:02.068
Blake, you got us all
on that one.

13:02.068 --> 13:04.838
The only decision I had to make
was who I thought could handle

13:04.838 --> 13:07.907
the 30‐second
broken heart better.

13:07.907 --> 13:09.976
So I was never gonna
let you go.

13:09.976 --> 13:13.680
Blake uses his save
for Lana.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.215
We'll see her
in the knockouts!

13:15.215 --> 13:17.851
I saved Lana because
she's got this raw talent,

13:17.851 --> 13:19.586
and I know she wants this
so bad.

13:19.586 --> 13:20.854
She's the kind of artist

13:20.854 --> 13:22.856
that's gonna deliver
week after week.

13:22.856 --> 13:24.991
I'm so excited to have
a female country artist

13:24.991 --> 13:26.626
on my team this year.

13:26.626 --> 13:27.961
I still have my steal,

13:27.961 --> 13:29.796
and I really loved Kinsey Rose,

13:29.796 --> 13:31.831
and I didn't want to have,
you know,

13:31.831 --> 13:33.700
two of them in the same lane.

13:35.101 --> 13:36.836
That's how I feel.
I just need to let it out.

13:36.836 --> 13:39.205
They make me feel so good
when they get saved!

13:39.205 --> 13:41.041
I almost started crying.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.842
Yeah, the save is special.
I love the save.

13:42.842 --> 13:44.711

13:44.711 --> 13:48.181

14:11.137 --> 14:13.106

I'm so happy for you.

14:13.106 --> 14:15.709
Libianca just has
such a unique voice,

14:15.709 --> 14:17.844
and her tone is so different,
and I'm interested to see

14:17.844 --> 14:20.547

15:10.931 --> 15:12.666
Xavier ‐‐ he's just got
this voice

15:12.666 --> 15:14.634
that you can kind of
throw anything at.

15:14.634 --> 15:15.936

Their voices, their
energy, they're so special.

16:03.783 --> 16:06.586
They were the hardest
I fought for anyb‐‐

16:06.586 --> 16:08.688
I literally was like,
"I must have you."

16:08.688 --> 16:10.056
Like, it was aggressive.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.558

16:16.463 --> 16:19.065
I could not think of
a better adviser for Ariana

16:19.065 --> 16:21.201
to bring in other than
Kristin Chenoweth.

16:21.201 --> 16:23.203
Hi. Oh, my gosh!
This is not real.

16:23.203 --> 16:24.738
It is real!

16:24.738 --> 16:28.441
It was Kristin.
She's a Broadway queen.

16:28.441 --> 16:31.678
It's just mind‐blowing.
I'm speechless.

16:31.678 --> 16:34.114
Y'all are like real
human beings. This is
just freaking me out.

16:34.114 --> 16:39.486
Working with two of the most
technically inclined singers

16:39.486 --> 16:42.522
in the industry right now,
it is a dream come true.

16:42.522 --> 16:45.692
Ariana is such an inspiration
to me and my music.

16:45.692 --> 16:48.094
So much so that on Halloween,

16:48.094 --> 16:50.697
I actually dressed up
as her with my friend.

16:50.697 --> 16:54.501
I grew up singing with
my sisters in musical theater.

16:54.501 --> 16:58.605
In college, I studied psychology
and proceeded with my master's,

16:58.605 --> 17:00.607
but the only thing
that I've really known

17:00.607 --> 17:03.743

ever has been music.

17:16.690 --> 17:19.459

and producing.

17:19.459 --> 17:20.760
Absolutely.
It's not just about
winning this show,

17:20.760 --> 17:23.096
it's about building a lifelong
career for yourself.

17:23.096 --> 17:25.098
To work with Ariana Grande,

17:25.098 --> 17:27.667
the most vocally capable woman

17:27.667 --> 17:30.770
I think exists, is so special.

17:30.770 --> 17:33.073
How did you react to the
song choice? Do you like it?

17:33.073 --> 17:35.108
Is it, like, too far
out of the wheelhouse?

17:35.108 --> 17:37.877

We were so excited.

17:37.877 --> 17:42.549
This really does depict how much
of a musician you are.
Oh, gosh.

17:42.549 --> 17:46.019
I gave them "Dilemma"
by Nelly and Kelly Rowland.

17:46.019 --> 17:48.488
I just thought you're gonna
make it more melodic

17:48.488 --> 17:50.056
and more your own.

17:50.056 --> 17:51.691
For me, the best surprise
of the whole experience

17:51.691 --> 17:54.427
is watching what Ari
chose for y'all to do,

no more lanes.

loves music.

19:00.594 --> 19:02.128

very polite with it.

But that was really fun.

25:53.139 --> 25:56.476

for a coach to take people

25:56.476 --> 25:58.144
out of their comfort zone
a little bit

25:58.144 --> 26:01.114
and see if they can handle it,
and both of you had,

26:01.114 --> 26:05.518
I think, the enthusiasm and
the connection to each other.

26:05.518 --> 26:07.687
Katherine,
you really stood out to me.

26:07.687 --> 26:09.055
Your voice
was really compelling.

26:09.055 --> 26:11.458
And if I were to pick,
I would pick Katherine.

26:11.458 --> 26:13.827
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

26:13.827 --> 26:16.796
Katherine, I'll start with you.
Your voice cuts through,

26:16.796 --> 26:19.132
which is really awesome for
a live performance setting.

26:19.132 --> 26:21.134
Thank you so much.
And, Vaughn, you chose to

26:21.134 --> 26:23.870
showcase yourself
in that higher falsetto

26:23.870 --> 26:25.538
doing the higher harmony.

26:25.538 --> 26:27.907
And I thought that ‐‐ it was
a really well‐matched battle.

26:27.907 --> 26:29.976

Vaughn, you stuck out to me.

26:29.976 --> 26:31.911
Thank you so much.

26:31.911 --> 26:34.114
It's interesting for me
to hear John

26:34.114 --> 26:38.218
talk about you were gonna
be singing "Dilemma,"

26:38.218 --> 26:40.153
because my thought was,
wow.

26:40.153 --> 26:43.089
I can't wait to hear that song
for the first time.

26:43.089 --> 26:45.926

huge hit song.

Like, this was
a huge song.

26:50.030 --> 26:53.867
There was a lot of rocks
where I lived.

26:53.867 --> 26:57.003
Vaughn,
you had the warmer tone,

26:57.003 --> 26:58.905
and bouncing off
what Kelly said,

26:58.905 --> 27:02.208
it's amazing, I heard the exact
flip‐flop of that.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.778
I felt like Katherine ‐‐
It's not amazing
that we disagree.

27:04.778 --> 27:06.780
It's right on par.

27:06.780 --> 27:09.015
I just felt like Katherine's
the one that gave it

27:09.015 --> 27:11.818
that extra little bit.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.156
Ari, you got
the final decision.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.191
Give us some thoughts before
you tell us who won this battle.

27:18.191 --> 27:21.461
That was so good!

27:21.461 --> 27:24.097
The thing about Katherine is
you're so precise

27:24.097 --> 27:26.700
and technically perfect.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.101
So this was such
a stretch for you,

the hell out of me tonight.

27:32.072 --> 27:33.840

28:19.085 --> 28:22.756
This was such a far step
out of her comfort zone

28:22.756 --> 28:24.057
that I had to go with her.

30:28.682 --> 30:31.785
and the energy
just explodes from the stage.

30:31.785 --> 30:32.819
John.

30:32.819 --> 30:34.220
Yes!

30:34.220 --> 30:35.822
I'm definitely here
at "The Voice"

30:35.822 --> 30:37.857
because of my Uncle Duane.

30:37.857 --> 30:40.627
He traveled all over the world
singing at different churches,

30:40.627 --> 30:43.530
and he passed away last year.

30:43.530 --> 30:44.864
If he was alive today,

30:44.864 --> 30:47.667
I think that he would be
so proud of me.

that I'm too young ♪

30:51.938 --> 30:54.541
BrittanyBree and Samara ‐‐
they have the chops,

30:54.541 --> 30:57.444
they have the soul, they have
all the tools they need

30:57.444 --> 30:59.679
to really pull this song off.

Hey!

31:08.655 --> 31:10.490
Thinking more about the lyrics

31:10.490 --> 31:12.158
and how it relates to my life.

31:12.158 --> 31:14.894
I've had many instances
in my life with women

31:14.894 --> 31:17.864
who weren't sure about the love
that they felt for me.

31:17.864 --> 31:21.201
I was kind of given
that 50% type of love,

31:21.201 --> 31:26.106
where I was giving 100%,
and it was very heartbreaking.

31:26.106 --> 31:28.475

31:28.475 --> 31:29.643

31:32.445 --> 31:36.182
It's gonna be
soooooooo good.

31:36.182 --> 31:37.684
I can't wait.
For real.

31:37.684 --> 31:39.019
Both of you have
such presence,

31:39.019 --> 31:41.488
and you can just
straight‐up sing.

31:41.488 --> 31:45.659
But, Samara, there was so much
deviation from the melody

31:45.659 --> 31:47.661
that I kind of lost it
sometimes.

31:47.661 --> 31:49.863
You want to give them
that sense of familiarity...
Right.

31:49.863 --> 31:52.866
...while also putting
your own individuality on it.

31:52.866 --> 31:55.602
So it's like
a matter of balance.
Yep.

31:55.602 --> 31:57.537
I was on a singing
competition show, too.

31:57.537 --> 31:59.472
I remember I was like,

31:59.472 --> 32:01.207
"This is my time to, like,
show myself."
Get it all out.

32:01.207 --> 32:02.809
"I want to change
every single melody.

32:02.809 --> 32:04.577
I want to add a million riffs."

32:04.577 --> 32:05.879
But I think
when you do too many riffs,

32:05.879 --> 32:07.814
it's kind of hard to hear.

32:07.814 --> 32:11.685
My sister, Amanda Brown,
was on "The Voice" in Season 3.

32:11.685 --> 32:14.921
I wanted to be on the stage
where she was.

32:14.921 --> 32:19.192
♪ Oh, oh, sweet thing ♪

32:19.192 --> 32:21.695
To be here now, the stakes
are so much higher.

32:21.695 --> 32:24.197
For once,
I'm at the center stage.

32:24.197 --> 32:28.935
I'm trying to prove
that I deserve to be here.

32:28.935 --> 32:32.205
BrittanyBree, I know this is
new territory for you,

32:32.205 --> 32:33.673
singing this kind of music,

32:33.673 --> 32:35.442
but just think about
what the lyric is,

32:35.442 --> 32:37.444
who you might be
singing that to...

32:37.444 --> 32:39.713
Ooh, yes.
...and what you want
that person to feel.

32:39.713 --> 32:42.515
This is what Aretha did,
you know?

32:42.515 --> 32:45.986
Yeah.
Like, Aretha was born
and raised in the church.

32:45.986 --> 32:50.824
Yes, yes.
Her father was a preacher,
and she took who she was

32:50.824 --> 32:53.960
and applied it to pop music,
and that's why she's the queen.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.696
Like, your past
and this present right now

32:56.696 --> 32:58.932
are ‐‐ are not, like,
two separate things,

32:58.932 --> 33:01.668
'cause you're bringing
that church and that big soul

33:01.668 --> 33:03.803
that you have
into these kinds of songs.

33:03.803 --> 33:06.439
And that's something that
we don't have right now.

33:06.439 --> 33:07.674
You know?
We need it.

33:07.674 --> 33:08.908
And we need it,
and that makes you

33:08.908 --> 33:10.577
really special.

33:10.577 --> 33:11.878
Aretha Franklin is the G. O. A. T.

33:11.878 --> 33:14.214
Those are some really big shoes
to fill.

33:20.553 --> 33:21.888
Hey!

33:21.888 --> 33:24.691
BrittanyBree's voice
really made me feel

33:24.691 --> 33:28.662
something that I just, like,
haven't felt in a long time.

33:28.662 --> 33:31.665
Samara ‐‐ I love
her tone of voice,

33:31.665 --> 33:33.833
the way
that she moves her body.

33:33.833 --> 33:35.702
These two singing this song ‐‐

33:35.702 --> 33:37.437
it might be
the best of the night.

33:37.437 --> 33:39.572
Let's figure out
that ending.

33:39.572 --> 33:41.675
I think we need
more of a moment.

33:41.675 --> 33:43.810
Because you guys are such
powerhouse singers,

33:43.810 --> 33:45.712
I feel like it'd be so sick
arrangement‐wise

33:45.712 --> 33:47.647
if there was a section
where you guys were

33:47.647 --> 33:49.549
intentionally having a riff battle.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.850
Oh, yeah, I love that.

33:50.850 --> 33:52.719
If you have a real plan
going in,

33:52.719 --> 33:54.554
and you go out there
and sing with the ability

33:54.554 --> 33:56.189
both of you have,

33:56.189 --> 33:57.524
it will be the best
battle performance.
Yeah.

33:57.524 --> 33:59.159
Okay?
Okay.

33:59.159 --> 34:01.561
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's gonna be so good!

34:01.561 --> 34:03.663
Oh, it's so good.
Thank you.

34:03.663 --> 34:07.701
This is gonna be
a soulful, sultry battle,

34:07.701 --> 34:11.671
and we'll see
who does this song justice.

34:11.671 --> 34:15.649
Oh! Just two
crazy voices.
Oh.

34:27.087 --> 34:29.155
Alright, more battles to come.
I still have a steal.

34:29.155 --> 34:30.657
This is gonna be good.

34:30.657 --> 34:33.560
My name is Blake Shelton,

34:33.560 --> 34:35.562
and I still have my steal.

34:35.562 --> 34:37.664
Still have my steal.

34:37.664 --> 34:39.466
Okay?

34:39.466 --> 34:41.534
Alright, alright!

34:43.503 --> 34:45.672
I have a good idea
who I might use my save on,

34:45.672 --> 34:47.574
but I'm waiting
to see what happens.

34:47.574 --> 34:49.009

That's one of my
favorite songs,

37:44.084 --> 37:45.652
not just to listen to,
but to sing.

37:45.652 --> 37:48.088
Your voices are insane.

37:48.088 --> 37:50.590
Thank you.
Thank you.

37:50.590 --> 37:52.192
Like, I mean,
BrittanyBree,

37:52.192 --> 37:54.027
your voice,
it kind of reminds me like,

37:54.027 --> 37:56.196
you know how Tina has kind of
rock 'n' roll soul,

37:56.196 --> 37:58.665
but then like Andra Day ‐‐
like, it has a little
bit of that, too.

37:58.665 --> 38:00.700
I loved every minute
you had your mouth open.

38:00.700 --> 38:03.136
Mm‐hmm.

38:03.136 --> 38:06.139
Samara, wow!

38:06.139 --> 38:07.807
It was this tug‐of‐war
of me going,

38:07.807 --> 38:09.175
"Who am I gonna
tell John to pick?"

38:09.175 --> 38:11.711
And I was like,
I don't care about John.

38:13.213 --> 38:14.714
What I care about...
Ouch!

38:14.714 --> 38:16.516
...is one of you
is gonna be

38:16.516 --> 38:18.084
available to steal.

38:18.084 --> 38:20.987
I loved it. I loved it.
Thank you.

38:20.987 --> 38:23.657
I was just
so blown away.

38:23.657 --> 38:25.191
This is the moment
right here

38:25.191 --> 38:28.194
where people can either kind
of buckle under the pressure

38:28.194 --> 38:30.597
or they step up
and they become a star.

38:30.597 --> 38:33.433
You both just really owned
the moment and the stage.

38:33.433 --> 38:35.001
Thank you.

38:35.001 --> 38:37.203
I have been obsessed with
you both since the blinds.

38:37.203 --> 38:41.074
You're both so spectacular,
and your tones are so different.

38:41.074 --> 38:43.810
And yet they complement
each other so beautifully.

38:43.810 --> 38:46.579
And I don't think anyone
outsang the other.

38:46.579 --> 38:50.517
From your stage presence
to your gorgeous looks ‐‐

38:50.517 --> 38:52.118
I'm dying.
Thank you.

38:52.118 --> 38:55.622
So, I cannot help you here.
Good luck.

38:55.622 --> 38:57.190
Thank you, Coaches.

38:57.190 --> 38:58.558
Alright, John,
you got the final decision.

38:58.558 --> 38:59.793
Give us some
thoughts first.

38:59.793 --> 39:01.094
Well, I always tell
my artists,

39:01.094 --> 39:03.129
"I want both of you
to go out here

39:03.129 --> 39:05.799
and be your absolute
best selves

39:05.799 --> 39:08.535
so that either I'm gonna
save you or one of these coaches

39:08.535 --> 39:10.103
are going to try to steal you
from me," and you ‐‐

39:11.671 --> 39:13.173
I know what y'all
are gonna try to do.

39:13.173 --> 39:14.674
What?
I know.

39:14.674 --> 39:17.043
Samara, when I gave you
coaching notes ‐‐

39:17.043 --> 39:19.613
make sure you still
stay true somewhat

39:19.613 --> 39:21.114
to what
the songwriter wrote ‐‐

39:21.114 --> 39:23.149
it was exactly the way
it needed to be.

39:23.149 --> 39:24.751
Thank you.

39:24.751 --> 39:27.687
BrittanyBree, that stank
you got on your voice,

39:27.687 --> 39:29.489
that hits me
right in my heart.

39:29.489 --> 39:32.525
And for you to have
never sung secular music

39:32.525 --> 39:34.661
prior to coming
to "The Voice,"

39:34.661 --> 39:37.497
for you to deliver it
with the passion,

39:37.497 --> 39:39.933
with the personality,
with the charisma that you did,

39:39.933 --> 39:41.701
you did exactly
what you were supposed to do.

39:41.701 --> 39:44.571
I love both of you
so much,

39:44.571 --> 39:46.606
and it's a very
difficult decision.

39:46.606 --> 39:48.642
John, the time has come.

39:48.642 --> 39:50.143
Who is the winner
of this battle?

39:50.143 --> 39:53.079
The winner
of this battle is...

39:56.049 --> 39:57.217
...BrittanyBree.

39:57.217 --> 40:00.053
BrittanyBree,
congratulations!

40:00.053 --> 40:01.621
Moving on to knockouts!

40:03.556 --> 40:05.191
BrittanyBree ‐‐ every note
that came out of her mouth

40:05.191 --> 40:08.595
was perfect, but I truly could
have gone either way.

40:08.595 --> 40:10.964
I did not want
to let go of either of them.

40:10.964 --> 40:12.966
Great job!

40:12.966 --> 40:15.535
Coaches, let me remind you
that Samara is available

40:15.535 --> 40:18.204
to steal or save ‐‐
Oh, we got a steal!

40:18.204 --> 40:20.573
That's the sound of a save!

40:20.573 --> 40:23.043
That's the sound
of another steal!

40:23.043 --> 40:24.644
Come on home.
I was first!

40:24.644 --> 40:27.047
Come back home!

40:27.047 --> 40:29.683
Wow!
Did you sense that hesitation
that he had?

40:29.683 --> 40:31.785
Oh, my God.
He did hesitate.
He hesitated.

40:31.785 --> 40:33.687
You know exactly
what I was planning to do.

40:33.687 --> 40:36.523
Let's start with Ariana.
What did you hear in Samara?

40:36.523 --> 40:38.024
You know that I adore you.

40:38.024 --> 40:39.759
I said backstage beforehand,

40:39.759 --> 40:41.962
I have one steal, and if I were
gonna use it on anyone,

40:41.962 --> 40:43.997
I would use it on Samara,
and that's the truth.

40:43.997 --> 40:46.633
Wow. I mean, he hesitated, too.
He hesitated.

40:46.633 --> 40:48.101
Oh, please. Please.

40:48.101 --> 40:50.003
Kelly, why do you want
to steal her?

40:50.003 --> 40:52.672
I just think you are such
a gifted vocalist.

40:52.672 --> 40:55.742
You're a blessing to this show
if you stay with your coach

40:55.742 --> 40:57.744
or if you go to
the right team ‐‐ mine.

40:59.079 --> 41:00.780
I‐I would love to be
your coach.

41:00.780 --> 41:02.716
You would look so cute
in my turquoise jacket.

41:02.716 --> 41:04.217
I'm just saying.

41:04.217 --> 41:07.120
John, excellent steal
opportunities for Samara.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.556
Why would you like
to use your one and only save?

41:09.556 --> 41:12.726
I truly love working with you,
and every once in a while,

41:12.726 --> 41:14.794
we put two people together
that you're like,

41:14.794 --> 41:17.764
"Man, I should have never
put them together."

41:17.764 --> 41:20.166
You two are, like,
some of the best talent

41:20.166 --> 41:22.669
in the entire
competition ‐‐ period.

41:22.669 --> 41:24.170
Thank you.

41:24.170 --> 41:27.641
I would feel so blessed
and fortunate

41:27.641 --> 41:31.678
to continue coaching you,
and I hope you pick me, please.

41:31.678 --> 41:35.582
Alright, Samara.
The decision is yours.

41:35.582 --> 41:37.050
I pressed
my button first, what?

41:37.050 --> 41:38.952
Who do you pick
as your coach?

41:38.952 --> 41:40.553
Come on home!

41:40.553 --> 41:43.123
Come on home.

41:43.123 --> 41:45.558
Come on, Samara!
Come on, Samara!

41:45.558 --> 41:47.460
Come on! Come on!

41:49.663 --> 41:52.732
This is impossible.

41:52.732 --> 41:54.167
Please, Samara!

41:54.167 --> 41:55.969
I just want to say thank you
to all of you.

42:00.473 --> 42:01.675
I'm gonna choose John.

42:03.643 --> 42:05.178
Yes!
John Legend...

42:05.178 --> 42:07.180
I'm so happy!

42:07.180 --> 42:09.816
...uses his one and only save!
You really were perfect.

42:09.816 --> 42:11.217
I had to save Samara.

42:11.217 --> 42:13.987
She flawlessly performed
"Something He Can Feel."

42:13.987 --> 42:15.488
Great job!

42:15.488 --> 42:17.557
Ariana and Kelly
put their best foot forward

42:17.557 --> 42:19.192
and tried to make that steal.

42:19.192 --> 42:21.928
But I was gonna fight
for Samara, and I did.

42:21.928 --> 42:23.430
Nice try, ladies.

42:23.430 --> 42:24.931
Oh, I love her.

42:24.931 --> 42:26.199
She's cool.
Yes.

42:26.199 --> 42:28.635
I'm so happy
we're back together.
Me too!
