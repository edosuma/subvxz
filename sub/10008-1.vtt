01:21.753 --> 01:24.813
Hey, will you guys shut up in there?

01:26.174 --> 01:27.868
Barbara.

01:27.968 --> 01:29.968
Oh, shit.

01:39.563 --> 01:42.966
What the hell is going on in here?
I am trying to study for a final.

01:43.066 --> 01:45.969
Yeah, we have finals too.
Ever hear of modern dance?

01:46.069 --> 01:49.431
- Can't you study to music?
- No, I can't study to music.

01:49.531 --> 01:53.477
- Turn it down or do I have to go to Sue?
- Go to Sue, then. Fuck off.

01:53.577 --> 01:57.402
- I'm going to Sue.
- I'm going to Sue.

02:10.801 --> 02:12.802
Oh.

02:12.929 --> 02:14.963
- Get off of me.
- What?

02:16.433 --> 02:18.466
Oh. Oh.

02:19.227 --> 02:23.006
Oh, there's somebody out there.
Come on. There's somebody out there.

02:23.106 --> 02:25.592
- There's nobody out there.
- There is.

02:29.321 --> 02:32.105
- Calm down.
- I can't calm down.

02:32.240 --> 02:37.935
You better take care of it,
cos I can't study with this disco music.

02:39.289 --> 02:42.317
All right, move. Come on.

02:42.417 --> 02:45.779
Oh, look. The little fink
brought back the master fink.

02:52.469 --> 02:55.359
- The music's not loud.
- Yes, it is.

03:39.182 --> 03:41.647
God, that scream is terrible.

03:43.353 --> 03:47.007
- What cat did you strangle to get that?
- That's her voice.

03:47.107 --> 03:48.675
- You didn't dub that?
- No.

03:48.775 --> 03:50.218
- That's hers?
- Yeah.

03:50.318 --> 03:52.352
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

03:52.988 --> 03:58.343
Run it again. I wanna hear the scream.

04:05.542 --> 04:08.092
- ...Run it?
- Yeah.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.209
And kill all the effects
except for the scream.

04:25.645 --> 04:28.315
Kill it.

04:29.065 --> 04:32.380
You're right. It's hers. And it's shit.

04:32.652 --> 04:36.681
Look, Jack, I didn't hire that girl
for her scream. I hired her for her tits.

04:36.781 --> 04:40.018
Then why worry?
Who's gonna be watching her scream?

04:40.118 --> 04:42.479
Wait a minute. Come on, Jack.

04:42.579 --> 04:46.319
Look, how many years
have we worked together?

04:48.460 --> 04:52.120
Let's see. I met you on Blood Bath, right?

04:52.255 --> 04:54.805
And then we did Blood Bath II.

04:54.883 --> 04:58.198
And then we did Bad Day at Blood Beach.

04:59.012 --> 05:01.902
And then we did Bordello of Blood.

05:02.182 --> 05:05.877
Well, that brings us up to date.
Co-ed Frenzy.

05:05.977 --> 05:09.214
By the way, I didn't tell you this but...

05:09.314 --> 05:12.217
I'd like to think this is our finest film.

05:12.317 --> 05:16.596
- Almost two years.
- Oh, God. Five films in two years.

05:16.696 --> 05:22.394
You know what I can't figure out? Why
a smart guy like you is still doing that shit.

05:22.494 --> 05:24.729
Come on. You do the shit. I do the sound.

05:24.829 --> 05:28.859
No, you do the shit. That wind sounds
like you're whistling in the crapper.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.236
It's library stuff we used a million times.

05:31.336 --> 05:34.948
That is the trouble.
I have heard it a million times.

05:35.048 --> 05:38.193
- Get something new.
- New wind. Got it.

05:38.343 --> 05:44.463
- And that scream. We gotta dub that.
- All right. Know any good screamers?

05:45.058 --> 05:47.925
- I got a few ideas.
- I bet you do.

05:48.061 --> 05:49.713
Just worry about the scream.

06:37.485 --> 06:40.764
...a sweeping condemnation
of White House policies.

06:40.864 --> 06:44.351
The same poll gave evidence
of a ground swell of support...

06:44.451 --> 06:47.646
...for Governor George McRyan
in his bid for nomination.

06:47.746 --> 06:53.026
If an election were held today, Governor
McRyan would win hands down,

06:53.126 --> 06:57.697
drawing a remarkable 62 per cent
of the vote to the president's 23.

06:57.797 --> 07:01.660
The president's campaign manager,
Jack Manners, told reporters:

07:01.760 --> 07:05.413
The president's had to make
some tough decisions.

07:05.513 --> 07:08.458
But when these policies are carried out...

07:08.558 --> 07:13.880
...and the economic climate improves,
as we confidently expect it will,

07:13.980 --> 07:18.927
the people will rally to support
the president in the upcoming primaries.

07:20.153 --> 07:22.806
A lot can happen between now and then.

07:22.906 --> 07:28.019
Congress waits anxiously for Governor
McRyan to declare his candidacy.

07:28.119 --> 07:32.399
They may not have long to wait. The
governor is now at the Bellevue Stratford...

07:32.499 --> 07:37.654
...where he will soon address the kickoff
dinner of the Liberty Day celebration.

07:37.754 --> 07:41.575
Some people think he will use the
occasion to throw his hat into the ring.

07:41.675 --> 07:44.578
Joan, any word
from the Bellevue Stratford yet?

07:44.678 --> 07:48.331
Not yet, Bill, but as soon as there is,
we will be going there live.

07:48.431 --> 07:53.795
Liberty Day is one of the most eagerly
awaited of all Philadelphia celebrations.

07:53.895 --> 07:56.840
But this year it's going to be extra special.

07:56.940 --> 08:02.220
It is 100 years since the Liberty Bell
was last rung. To honour this centennial,

08:02.320 --> 08:05.307
...a parade on Saturday...

08:05.407 --> 08:10.812
...will end up at Penn's Landing
with a spectacular display of fireworks.

08:10.912 --> 08:14.483
In addition, a full-size replica
of the Liberty Bell has been made...

08:14.583 --> 08:18.945
...from pennies donated by schoolchildren
from every state in the Union.

08:19.045 --> 08:22.574
And they'll be ringing it
after the fireworks at Penn's Landing.

08:22.674 --> 08:24.674
That's right.

08:24.676 --> 08:27.954
Hold it. We've got the Bellevue Stratford.

08:28.054 --> 08:31.792
Let's go live to our political
correspondent, Frank Donahue,

08:31.892 --> 08:35.003
at the Liberty Ball
at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel.

08:35.102 --> 08:39.049
Frank, you look fabulous.
Have you spoken with the governor yet?

08:39.149 --> 08:42.344
Yes, Joan, briefly. He just arrived.

08:42.443 --> 08:47.557
I did ask the governor his impression
so far of this year's Liberty Day Jubilee.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.726
He said he was honoured to be here...

08:49.826 --> 08:54.147
...and plans to attend the parade and the
ringing of the new bell on Saturday night.

08:54.247 --> 08:57.984
He felt it a shame the Liberty Bell
had been silenced for so long.

08:59.211 --> 09:02.572
He looked forward to a new voice
of liberty throughout the land.

09:02.672 --> 09:08.662
The governor is now greeting friends and
will be enjoying a meal in the ballroom.

09:08.762 --> 09:13.416
But his people have told us
that he will speak to us after that meal.

09:14.643 --> 09:18.797
I'm Frank Donahue. 'Eye on the City'
News, Bellevue Stratford.

09:18.897 --> 09:22.342
Thank you, Frank.
We'll be getting back to you later on.

09:22.442 --> 09:26.352
Meanwhile, in other news,
a teacher's strike...

10:07.112 --> 10:11.192
...Let's take a walk
along the river here.

10:12.117 --> 10:14.150
Mm. Nice.

10:15.537 --> 10:19.441
- David, look. Someone's on the bridge.
- Let's not worry about that.

10:19.541 --> 10:21.735
- He's staring right at us.
- Who cares?

10:21.835 --> 10:23.487
- I care.
- Betsy.

10:23.587 --> 10:26.615
- I don't wanna stay here. Let's go.
- Yeah, OK.

10:26.715 --> 10:28.909
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

10:29.009 --> 10:34.534
- What is he, a Peeping Tom?
- Oh, who cares? Let's walk down there.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.857
Jesus Christ.

12:46.646 --> 12:48.888
Oh, God. Please help me.

12:53.361 --> 12:56.506
Get me out of here, please.

13:03.622 --> 13:06.187
Oh. Oh, God.

14:24.286 --> 14:26.730
- A bang?
- Yeah, some sort of a bang.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.982
- Where?
- I'm not sure where.

14:29.082 --> 14:30.859
- You were facing the car?
- Yes.

14:30.959 --> 14:32.486
Well, you heard the blowout.

14:32.586 --> 14:34.988
Yes, but the first sound I heard was a bang.

14:35.088 --> 14:37.157
- Some kind of an echo.
- No.

14:37.257 --> 14:40.535
Look, I know what an echo sounds like.
I'm a sound man.

14:40.635 --> 14:43.455
And the bang was before the blowout.

14:43.555 --> 14:47.459
- What were you doin' up there?
- I was recording sounds for a movie.

14:47.559 --> 14:50.279
- You recorded the accident?
- Yes.

14:52.188 --> 14:54.132
What happened after that?

14:54.232 --> 14:56.802
The car went off the road
into the creek and I...

14:56.902 --> 14:59.387
- What did you do then?
- I'm tryin' to tell you.

14:59.487 --> 15:03.642
I ran down, jumped in the creek
and pulled out the girl.

15:03.742 --> 15:06.436
- There was a girl?
- Yes, there was a girl.

15:06.536 --> 15:10.107
- What girl?
- The girl I brought here. In the room.

15:10.207 --> 15:12.240
She was inside the car?

15:13.043 --> 15:15.076
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

15:16.296 --> 15:18.824
I wasn't bobbing for apples.
Of course I'm sure.

15:18.924 --> 15:21.409
It can get pretty dark
under eight feet of water.

15:21.509 --> 15:27.791
Is this known as obtaining objective
eyewitness testimony? If it is, forget it.

15:27.891 --> 15:31.716
We gotta get the stretcher through.
Step back.

15:45.325 --> 15:47.325
Doctor. How is she?

15:47.410 --> 15:52.691
Very lucky. Mild shock, some cuts
and bruises. No major injuries.

15:52.791 --> 15:56.278
- Can I see her?
- She might be asleep. She's sedated.

15:56.378 --> 16:00.118
- I'll just say goodbye.
- Don't stay too long.

16:02.342 --> 16:04.375
How you doin'?

16:06.471 --> 16:09.756
- Do you have my purse?
- No.

16:09.891 --> 16:13.295
I'm sure the police'll find it.
I wouldn't worry about it.

16:13.395 --> 16:15.088
I know.

16:15.188 --> 16:17.674
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

16:17.774 --> 16:20.802
Wait a minute. I think
you'd better get back to bed.

16:20.902 --> 16:24.890
I don't think they're finished
with you yet. Come on, up. Up.

16:24.990 --> 16:27.540
- Just for a minute.
- All right.

16:28.076 --> 16:30.109
So how do you feel?

16:31.288 --> 16:34.030
He said I was lucky-- the doctor.

16:34.165 --> 16:37.140
Yeah. He should've been there, huh?

16:38.920 --> 16:42.235
- Thanks for getting me out.
- No problem.

16:44.009 --> 16:46.995
I didn't realise you were this pretty,
with all that mud.

16:47.095 --> 16:49.712
I don't have any make-up on.

16:50.307 --> 16:53.919
Well, don't worry about it.
It's fine. It's a hospital.

16:54.019 --> 16:57.589
- Who are you?
- I'm Jack Terry. Who are you?

16:59.190 --> 17:02.934
- Sally.
- Sally? Nice to meet you, Sally.

17:14.789 --> 17:16.823
Are you leaving?

17:17.459 --> 17:19.499
Yeah, I gotta go. But...

17:20.462 --> 17:25.282
How about, when you get outta here,
we have a drink sometime? In a glass.

17:25.383 --> 17:27.368
- Sure.
- OK. You take care.

17:27.469 --> 17:29.794
How about tonight?

17:29.930 --> 17:34.501
No, I don't think so, Sally. Not tonight.
But I'll ask the doctor when you get out.

17:34.601 --> 17:38.505
- He wants to keep me for observation.
- Sally, you gotta stay in bed.

17:38.605 --> 17:41.087
I don't like to be observed.

17:41.233 --> 17:44.136
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do about that.

17:44.236 --> 17:48.390
Please. I really don't like hospitals.
I've got to get out of here.

17:48.490 --> 17:53.019
All right. I'll make you a deal, OK?
You stay here, I'll get your clothes,

17:53.119 --> 17:58.024
and when I come back, we'll go out
and have a drink, OK? All right?

17:58.124 --> 18:00.861
- I need shoes and a coat.
- Yes. I'll get them.

18:00.961 --> 18:03.697
But if you don't stay, I'm not comin' back.

18:03.797 --> 18:05.830
- OK.
- All right.

18:24.142 --> 18:27.421
It looks like
she's gonna be all right.

18:27.521 --> 18:31.216
This guy, Jack Terry, that took her
out of the car, he's over there.

18:31.316 --> 18:36.221
He's being a real horse's ass. I don't know
how we're gonna keep the lid on this guy.

18:36.321 --> 18:39.933
Get some men here. I want this place
sealed. I don't want this circus.

18:40.033 --> 18:44.021
Sir, this is the guy. He was there when
it happened. He saw the whole thing.

18:44.121 --> 18:49.646
- He's the one who saw it?
- Yes. He pulled the girl out of the car.

18:53.797 --> 18:57.117
I wanna talk to you.
And to the girl too. Where is she?

18:57.217 --> 18:59.119
- She's in there.
- She's asleep.

18:59.219 --> 19:02.581
And if you wanna talk to me,
make it quick, cos I wanna go home.

19:02.681 --> 19:06.126
- There someplace we can talk in private?
- I'll take care of it.

19:06.226 --> 19:09.796
- Would you secure that room for us?
- I want these men checked out.

19:09.896 --> 19:13.967
- Officer, what's goin' on here?
- Car accident. Guy got killed.

19:14.067 --> 19:18.013
- I know, but what's the big deal?
- Did you know the guy was McRyan?

19:18.113 --> 19:19.515
Governor McRyan?

19:19.615 --> 19:24.630
That stiff on the stretcher
was probably our next president.

19:24.745 --> 19:27.805
- Hell, he had my vote.
- Jesus Christ.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.534
Let's talk in here.

19:42.638 --> 19:46.208
- You pulled the girl out of that car?
- Yes.

19:46.975 --> 19:52.214
Well, I would like for you to forget
about her. Forget you ever saw her.

19:52.314 --> 19:54.174
Wait a minute.

19:54.274 --> 19:57.136
- Who are you?
- My name is Lawrence Henry.

19:57.236 --> 20:00.353
- I worked for Governor McRyan.
- Ah.

20:00.489 --> 20:02.522
He was also a friend.

20:03.784 --> 20:05.817
He was my friend.

20:07.537 --> 20:10.107
Look, I'm very sorry about the governor,

20:10.207 --> 20:15.696
and I obviously would have loved
to have saved his life too, but...

20:15.796 --> 20:18.323
I mean, I was there and she was there.

20:18.423 --> 20:23.078
We know what happened,
but the governor is dead now and...

20:23.178 --> 20:26.165
...we don't want to embarrass his family.

20:26.265 --> 20:30.043
Do you have any idea what the press
would do if they got ahold of this?

20:30.143 --> 20:33.422
You want me to say she wasn't there?
I already told the police.

20:33.522 --> 20:35.987
That's already taken care of.

20:38.568 --> 20:43.807
- All right. What about the girl?
- I'll talk to her. She'll cooperate.

20:43.907 --> 20:47.811
Just one playmate just vanishes
from McRyan's car, just like that?

20:47.911 --> 20:51.226
- That's right.
- Aw, Jesus, I don't know.

20:51.248 --> 20:56.943
Can't you keep your mouth shut?
It's better the governor died alone.

20:57.796 --> 21:01.283
I just don't know if I can do that.
I was there, she was there, and...

21:01.383 --> 21:04.411
Who gives a damn that you were there?

21:04.511 --> 21:08.707
You wanna tell his wife that he died
with his hand up some girl's dress?

21:08.807 --> 21:11.919
- Or let her read it in the papers?
- That is what happened.

21:12.019 --> 21:17.799
- That is the truth, isn't it?
- What difference does that make to you?

21:18.942 --> 21:23.872
But it would make a great deal
of difference to his family.

21:30.746 --> 21:31.563
All right.

21:31.663 --> 21:35.573
Good. We'll slip you
and the girl out the back.

21:41.506 --> 21:43.826
How about your place?

21:43.926 --> 21:46.646
You don't wanna go home, do you?

21:48.013 --> 21:52.215
- They told you who was in the car, right?
- Yeah.

21:52.351 --> 21:57.422
Well, some smart reporter could
figure I was there too, you know?

21:57.522 --> 22:01.641
They got my purse
with my name and address.

22:01.777 --> 22:04.304
They're gonna be camped on my doorstep.

22:04.404 --> 22:08.725
What about my doorstep? I'm the one who
pulled you out of that wreck, didn't I?

22:08.825 --> 22:10.859
Yeah, right.

22:10.994 --> 22:13.028
Let's go to a motel.

22:16.792 --> 22:20.612
First it's a drink, then it's my place,
now it's a motel.

22:20.712 --> 22:23.942
Things are movin' fast tonight, Sally.

22:34.726 --> 22:36.726
Whoops.

22:36.853 --> 22:38.893
Stand here for a second.

23:46.632 --> 23:51.203
- ...Beautiful night for a walk.
- Yes, it is.

23:51.303 --> 23:54.790
Let's take a walk along the river here.

23:54.890 --> 23:57.799
- Mm. Nice.
- David, look.

23:57.935 --> 24:00.879
- Someone's on the bridge.
- Let's not worry about that.

24:00.979 --> 24:03.173
- He's staring right at us.
- Who cares?

24:03.273 --> 24:05.008
- I care.
- Betsy.

24:05.108 --> 24:08.095
- I don't wanna stay here. Let's go.
- Yeah, OK.

24:08.195 --> 24:10.305
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

24:10.405 --> 24:15.930
- What is he, a Peeping Tom?
- Oh, who cares? Let's walk down there.

25:24.021 --> 25:26.021
Jesus Christ.

25:54.092 --> 25:56.126
Shit.

28:03.597 --> 28:06.232
So, uh... you want some coffee?

28:08.769 --> 28:12.594
- Huh? You want some coffee?
- Mm. Good morning.

28:12.689 --> 28:15.008
- Hi. How you doin'?
- I'm fine. How are you?

28:15.108 --> 28:17.851
Pretty good. There you go.

28:17.986 --> 28:21.932
What are you doin' here?
You listenin' to some music?

28:22.032 --> 28:26.568
Nope. This is my... This is my job.

28:26.703 --> 28:29.898
- I do sound effects for movies.
- Oh, movies, huh?

28:29.998 --> 28:33.110
Matter of fact, last night
I was out recording some sounds.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.279
What do you mean, sound effects?

28:35.379 --> 28:41.910
You know, when you see a movie and you
hear a door slam or a bird chirp or wind,

28:42.010 --> 28:44.492
I record those actual sounds,

28:44.638 --> 28:48.125
and then I put them in a movie,
and then you see the movie.

28:48.225 --> 28:49.668
- Oh.
- Last night...

28:49.768 --> 28:51.885
- Big movies?
- No. Just...

28:52.020 --> 28:54.339
Just bad ones, unfortunately.

28:54.439 --> 28:56.758
I really love movies, you know.

28:56.858 --> 29:02.520
It's a very interesting subject to me
because I do make-up.

29:02.656 --> 29:07.311
Right now it's only behind a counter, but
I dream about doin' make-up for movies.

29:07.411 --> 29:12.357
I've seen these big movie stars
like Barbra Streisand, you know?

29:12.457 --> 29:14.651
- They don't do it right.
- No.

29:14.751 --> 29:18.746
- I know how to fix a face.
- Really? That's good.

29:18.922 --> 29:21.897
I want you to hear something. Look.

29:22.384 --> 29:27.247
Last night I was recording some sounds,
and I recorded your accident.

29:27.347 --> 29:29.291
I got the whole thing on tape.

29:29.391 --> 29:32.211
- Oh. You recorded the accident.
- Yes, I did.

29:32.311 --> 29:36.465
Except I don't think you had an accident.
I think your tyre was shot out.

29:36.565 --> 29:39.551
- That's crazy.
- No, it's not. Listen to this.

29:39.651 --> 29:45.015
You're gonna hear two sounds. The first
is a gunshot, and the second is a blowout.

29:45.115 --> 29:47.148
All right? Listen up.

29:55.751 --> 29:58.904
- Now listen again.
- I heard a noise. Maybe it was a gunshot.

29:59.004 --> 30:03.367
But, I'll tell you, I don't really feature
listenin' to a replay of last night.

30:03.467 --> 30:05.500
It's kinda depressing.

30:05.636 --> 30:07.788
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

30:07.888 --> 30:10.608
What were you doing with McRyan?

30:12.601 --> 30:17.005
That's a very personal question.
That's none of your business.

30:17.105 --> 30:20.551
- I don't mean the details. I just...
- I'm gettin' a cold here.

30:20.651 --> 30:22.845
- Forget it, Sally.
- Personal questions.

30:22.945 --> 30:26.348
- I don't even know who you are.
- I'd like you to get to know who I am.

30:26.448 --> 30:29.309
- How about that drink?
- Some other time, OK?

30:29.409 --> 30:35.529
Sally, I saved your life. The least
you could do is have a drink with me.

30:35.958 --> 30:40.404
All right. You can call me at my girlfriend
Judy Demming's. I'll be there.

30:40.504 --> 30:44.324
- She's in the book.
- All right. You tellin' me the truth?

30:44.424 --> 30:46.910
- Yeah.
- All right. I'm gonna call you.

30:47.010 --> 30:49.010
OK.

31:17.249 --> 31:20.694
Jack. They got movies of McRyan
gettin' killed. I just heard.

31:20.794 --> 31:22.654
- Maybe it's on the news.
- What?

31:22.754 --> 31:25.157
Movies of McRyan gettin' killed.

31:25.257 --> 31:28.577
Incredible as it may seem,
a local photographer, Manny Karp,

31:28.677 --> 31:31.497
was on the scene of the accident
with his camera.

31:31.597 --> 31:37.217
Mr Karp sold his film to 'News Today'
magazine this morning...

31:37.352 --> 31:39.511
- News Today...
- Shh.

31:39.646 --> 31:43.050
Our own Frank Donahue spoke
with Mr Karp just a few moments ago...

31:43.150 --> 31:46.040
...outside the magazine's offices.

31:46.278 --> 31:50.432
Well, I'll tell ya. I had gone out there
to try out this new film stock, right?

31:50.532 --> 31:55.729
It's a very high speed. It's good for
night shooting. I do a lotta work at night.

31:55.829 --> 32:01.401
So I'm out there and all of a sudden I hear
this car barrellin' down the road.

32:01.501 --> 32:05.948
I didn't pay too much attention till
all of a sudden I hear it startin' to skid.

32:06.048 --> 32:10.744
I turn around, my camera's runnin'
and I catch him goin' through the railing.

32:10.844 --> 32:14.164
Mr Karp. Frank Donahue,
'Eye on the City' News.

32:14.264 --> 32:17.084
Mr Karp, was the governor driving?
Was he in control?

32:17.184 --> 32:20.212
Control? It went into the drink.
He wasn't in no control.

32:20.312 --> 32:23.090
- Was he alone in the car?
- I didn't see anybody.

32:23.190 --> 32:26.844
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

32:26.944 --> 32:29.847
- No cop ever did anything for me.
- Hey, Jack.

32:29.947 --> 32:32.683
They ain't gonna give me money
like these guys here.

32:32.783 --> 32:34.518
- Where you goin'?
- I gotta go.

32:34.618 --> 32:37.729
You gotta go? What about the auditions?

32:37.829 --> 32:40.697
Exclusive photos. McRyan's death.

32:40.832 --> 32:45.507
One at a time, please.
Exclusive photos. McRyan's death.

32:46.922 --> 32:48.490
- It's about time.
- Is Rick in?

32:48.590 --> 32:53.745
- No. But Sam's got girls for you to hear.
- Give me his key. Come on, come on.

32:53.845 --> 32:57.925
- What about Sam and the girls?
- I'll do it later.

33:12.739 --> 33:14.739
Jack?

33:14.783 --> 33:16.816
Yo, Jack.

33:17.494 --> 33:20.163
Come on, open up. It's Sam.

33:20.998 --> 33:23.031
Jack.

35:32.129 --> 35:35.449
This is the pivotal moment in the film.
You gotta realise that.

35:35.549 --> 35:38.535
- Jack. Where are you goin'?
- Sam, I'll be right back.

35:38.635 --> 35:41.355
I need you now. Now get in here.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.669
- What do you think?
- Keep lookin'.

35:47.769 --> 35:49.844
Keep lookin'? Hey, Jack.

36:04.870 --> 36:09.942
- Sorry, Jack. I'm all stacked up.
- Please, just this once, as a favour to me.

36:10.042 --> 36:13.695
I'll see what I can do.
Come back after midnight.

36:13.795 --> 36:15.829
Sally? It's Jack.

36:16.423 --> 36:18.905
See? I told you I'd call you.

36:19.051 --> 36:21.941
How about that drink you promised?

36:24.514 --> 36:26.548
Where are you goin'?

36:28.435 --> 36:31.495
Why don't I meet you at the station?

36:39.821 --> 36:41.473
Sally.

36:41.573 --> 36:42.933
Hi.

36:43.033 --> 36:47.453
- I'm so glad I caught you.
- Yeah, I was out the door.

36:47.621 --> 36:49.439
Look, I only got 20 minutes.

36:49.539 --> 36:53.318
That's fine. We'll have a quick drink
and you'll be on your way.

36:53.418 --> 36:56.029
Well... I wanna get a good seat, you know?

36:56.129 --> 37:00.117
- Aw, come on, Sally. You promised me.
- OK, but just 10 minutes.

37:00.217 --> 37:03.872
- OK. Come on. Let me take this.
- OK. Thanks.

37:04.137 --> 37:06.206
- How are you feelin'?
- Pretty good.

37:06.306 --> 37:08.340
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

37:18.068 --> 37:22.573
What's the first thing you see
when you meet somebody?

37:22.614 --> 37:25.065
Legs. I'm a leg man.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.897
- Come on.
- All right. Face. You see their face.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.523
Exactly.

37:31.623 --> 37:38.036
So, if your face doesn't look right,
no one is gonna look at you again.

37:38.171 --> 37:42.117
- I don't think your face needs make-up.
- Every face needs make-up.

37:42.217 --> 37:44.745
- But it shouldn't look like make-up.
- Oh, I see.

37:44.845 --> 37:50.417
I've worked on this face. I've hidden
everything so you don't see the make-up.

37:50.517 --> 37:53.337
- You got make-up on right now?
- Yeah, I do.

37:53.437 --> 37:57.216
- I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
- Absolutely.

37:57.316 --> 38:01.720
And, you see, this took me two hours.
And this is the 'no make-up look'.

38:01.820 --> 38:06.141
Really? I'd like to see what the 'make-up
look' looks like. I bet that's good, huh?

38:06.241 --> 38:09.937
Well, I... I only do that for special occasions.

38:10.037 --> 38:13.023
How about a broken nose?
How would you deal with that?

38:13.123 --> 38:16.235
Oh, that's easy. You just take a little...

38:16.335 --> 38:20.078
Wait a minute.
Let me see. I can show you.

38:20.213 --> 38:22.658
Yeah. You get a brush like this, right?

38:22.758 --> 38:25.160
You take a little brown powder.

38:25.260 --> 38:28.372
- You just make a little brown...
- What are you doin'?

38:28.472 --> 38:31.291
Hey, wait a minute.
This is serious business here.

38:31.391 --> 38:34.211
- You interested or not?
- Oh, yes. OK. Sorry.

38:34.311 --> 38:36.797
You make a brown line
and kinda smudge it in.

38:36.897 --> 38:40.592
It has to be real subtle
so as no one'll notice it.

38:40.692 --> 38:43.768
But... What are you smiling about?

38:43.904 --> 38:46.974
I'm impressed that
you know so much about this.

38:47.074 --> 38:49.601
- You're not interested at all.
- Yes, I am.

38:49.701 --> 38:53.313
You're not. You just kept me
sittin' here talkin' so I'd miss my train.

38:53.413 --> 38:56.483
That's not true, Sally.
I just didn't want you to go.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.609
Why?

38:57.709 --> 39:01.029
Because I like you, and I just met you
and you're goin' off on me.

39:01.129 --> 39:07.249
- I don't know anything about you.
- I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.706
- All right. You're a sound man, right?
- Yeah.

39:10.806 --> 39:13.000
OK. How'd you get that job?

39:13.100 --> 39:16.245
That's a good question. I don't know.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.882
No, I'll tell ya. It all started in school, OK?

39:19.982 --> 39:24.344
I was the kind of kid who fixed radios,
made my own stereos,

39:24.444 --> 39:27.264
won all the science fairs -
you know the type.

39:27.364 --> 39:31.310
After that I went into the army,
and I refined my skills there.

39:31.410 --> 39:34.188
Oh, yeah? Were you
in any wars or anything?

39:34.288 --> 39:39.568
No, no. I was such a communication whiz,
they wouldn't let me leave New Jersey.

39:39.668 --> 39:43.864
Then I went into the police for a while,
and after that I went into movies.

39:43.964 --> 39:46.283
Wait a minute. You were a cop?

39:46.383 --> 39:49.453
- No. I worked for the Kean Commission.
- What's that?

39:49.553 --> 39:53.624
A group of politicians that got together
to try to stop police corruption.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.508
- Oh.
- Then I quit that and...

39:56.643 --> 39:58.718
Well, what'd you do?

39:58.854 --> 40:05.399
- It's a long story. You don't wanna know.
- Oh, I do. This is very interesting.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.055
I thought you wanted
to know about movies.

40:08.155 --> 40:13.477
Yeah, movies are great, but this is... this is
like real life on the streets. You know?

40:13.577 --> 40:15.610
It's exciting.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.489
All right.

40:19.625 --> 40:25.364
I, um... I wired their best undercover cop.
A guy by the name of Freddie Corso.

40:25.464 --> 40:29.076
And one of Freddie's cases
was to set up a corrupt police captain...

40:29.176 --> 40:31.370
...who was tryin' to shake down a Mob guy.

40:31.470 --> 40:35.415
And my job was to rig a wire on him
so I could record the conversation.

40:35.515 --> 40:38.001
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, 'wire'?

40:38.101 --> 40:44.986
It's a tiny mike attached to a transmitter
that I strapped around Freddie's waist.

40:47.569 --> 40:49.694
Mackey, hand me the tape.

40:50.614 --> 40:56.734
- OK, Freddie, give me sound. Count to 10.
- One, two, three, four, five...

41:03.168 --> 41:06.029
It was a great wire.
He could be blocks away...

41:06.129 --> 41:09.199
...and you could hear everything
within 10 feet of him.

41:09.299 --> 41:12.286
- Hey, Milt. How ya doin'?
- Hello, Freddie.

41:12.386 --> 41:15.122
- Good to see ya.
- You look good.

41:15.222 --> 41:18.876
- You too. You look great in that get-up.
- Thanks.

41:18.976 --> 41:22.337
So, uh... I brought
somebody here I want you to meet.

41:22.437 --> 41:24.506
Captain Kennedy, this is Milt.

41:24.606 --> 41:26.800
Who the fuck wants to meet him?

41:26.900 --> 41:31.065
- Milt, take it easy.
- Hey, I don't wanna meet him.

41:31.154 --> 41:35.267
Hey, take it easy. This man
could put the cap on everything.

41:35.367 --> 41:38.896
All right, come on in the car.
We'll take a ride and talk.

41:38.996 --> 41:42.524
And the first thing
that the captain says to the Mob guy:

41:42.624 --> 41:45.903
Look, I understand
that the man has a brother-in-law.

41:46.003 --> 41:49.156
Now, I happened to see him
talkin' to his brother-in-law.

41:49.256 --> 41:52.034
Now, the brother-in-law
is a known felon, Freddie,

41:52.134 --> 41:55.621
and Milt's out on parole,
and that's a parole violation.

41:55.721 --> 42:01.668
Now, I'm gonna have to tell the parole
officer. If I do, he's goin' back in the can.

42:01.768 --> 42:07.174
But I think I could work somethin' out that
I don't have to tell him for... 5,000 bucks.

42:07.274 --> 42:13.311
$5,000? Freddie, you little prick.
We started this thing for $1,000.

42:13.447 --> 42:14.848
$1,000?

42:14.948 --> 42:19.144
I'm gettin' this clear as a bell
on tape and I start to hear the static.

42:19.244 --> 42:23.857
You think you can?
You're outta your.

42:23.957 --> 42:28.462
We can work this thing out.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.830
- He's goin' up the river. You understand?
- Right.

42:37.930 --> 42:41.792
What's the matter? You're sweatin',
Freddie. What's the matter?

42:41.892 --> 42:47.422
The fuckin' whiz kid didn't figure
Freddie would get nervous and sweat.

42:47.522 --> 42:51.426
The battery in the transmitter
shorted out and burned a hole in him.

42:51.526 --> 42:56.201
Hey, pull over to this gas station.
I gotta take a piss.

43:19.721 --> 43:21.081
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

43:21.181 --> 43:25.961
The battery in the transmitter is arcing.
It's burning him. I gotta get in there.

43:26.061 --> 43:29.089
- You can't. You'll blow his cover.
- I gotta go in there.

43:29.189 --> 43:32.050
- You can't.
- My fuckin' battery burned a hole in him.

43:32.150 --> 43:35.125
- You're gonna screw things up.
- Shh.

43:36.989 --> 43:39.624
- I gotta go.
- Jack, you're nuts.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.877
Aw, Jesus Christ.

44:01.847 --> 44:03.880
Aw... no.

44:28.457 --> 44:32.820
- It wasn't your fault.
- Yeah, well, you tell that to Freddie.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.662
- Shit.
- Are you OK?

44:35.797 --> 44:40.953
No. Something's buggin' me. This whole
thing with Henry, the governor's assistant.

44:41.053 --> 44:45.457
Oh, he talked to you too, huh?
That's why I'm leavin' town.

44:45.557 --> 44:48.085
He gave me some money
to disappear for a while.

44:48.185 --> 44:52.589
I thought so. Look, they are covering up
a lot more than you being with McRyan.

44:52.689 --> 44:56.426
- I know that tyre was shot out.
- How can you be so sure?

44:56.526 --> 45:00.103
- Did you see the News Today photos?
- Yeah.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.558
I found a way to put my sound with them.

45:02.658 --> 45:07.588
And when you see it,
I'm sure you'll see it was no blowout.

45:07.871 --> 45:09.356
I don't know.

45:09.456 --> 45:12.317
Would you stick around
for a couple of days?

45:12.417 --> 45:16.071
- What for?
- I just think you could help me with this.

45:16.171 --> 45:21.910
Jack, I don't know. I'm in a helluva lot of
trouble already. If I stick around here...

45:22.010 --> 45:24.454
If I can just clear myself of this...

45:24.554 --> 45:27.666
We could go away together.
I mean... why not?

45:27.766 --> 45:32.101
What the hell's the sense
of goin' away by yourself?

45:32.437 --> 45:34.471
- I don't know.
- Come on.

45:40.821 --> 45:44.051
I have to think about it or somethin'.

45:48.078 --> 45:50.111
I'll think about it.

49:50.195 --> 49:52.575
Hey, Sal. How ya doin', huh?

49:52.614 --> 49:56.768
It's good to see... I was just hangin'
around, watchin' this great movie on TV.

49:56.868 --> 49:59.333
You look terrific.

49:59.538 --> 50:02.853
Yeah. So what are you doin' in Reading?

50:06.169 --> 50:11.524
Listen, you want somethin' to drink here?
How about some Scotch?

50:20.225 --> 50:22.258
- Yeah?
- It's Sally.

50:25.981 --> 50:29.057
Hey, Sal. Hey, come on in. Come in.

50:29.192 --> 50:31.845
You look great.
What are you doin' around here?

50:31.945 --> 50:34.848
Jesus, Manny.
Don't they ever clean this place?

50:34.948 --> 50:39.102
You gotta get up real early
to catch a maid. I haven't made it yet.

50:40.746 --> 50:43.065
Hey, I'm sure glad you come by, you know?

50:43.165 --> 50:45.615
Listen, how'd you find me?

50:45.751 --> 50:51.073
- We worked this place a million times.
- Oh, that's right. Hey, you want a drink?

50:51.173 --> 50:54.618
- This isn't a social visit, Manny.
- Oh, no, huh? Oh.

50:54.718 --> 50:58.497
You almost got me killed the other night.
Dead-- you understand?

50:58.597 --> 51:03.335
Oh, hey, babe. I didn't have nothin'
to do with that. That was an accident.

51:03.435 --> 51:06.547
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

51:06.647 --> 51:10.259
I took off as soon as I saw
that kid jump into the creek.

51:10.359 --> 51:14.429
He did a helluva lot better job
than I coulda ever done.

51:14.529 --> 51:21.669
You know, I don't know if I ever told you
this before but... I can't even swim, babe.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.109
Great.

55:07.471 --> 55:11.542
Terry, do you know how many conspiracy
nuts I've already had in here today?

55:11.642 --> 55:12.668
No.

55:12.768 --> 55:17.798
If I had a fuckin' dime for every one of 'em
I'd buy all of Florida and retire in peace.

55:17.898 --> 55:20.884
It's very clear in these photos.
The flash and the smoke.

55:20.984 --> 55:25.889
It could be a lot of things. Why the fuck
does everything have to be a conspiracy?

55:25.989 --> 55:30.435
A man has a couple too many drinks,
he drives off the road, falls into a creek.

55:30.535 --> 55:34.022
- Accident, plain and simple.
- It was not an accident.

55:34.122 --> 55:37.359
I was there. That tyre was shot out.
I heard it. I recorded it.

55:37.459 --> 55:41.738
So you're an earwitness
to an assassination. It's got a nice ring.

55:41.838 --> 55:45.409
- Are you heading up the investigation?
- Yeah.

55:45.509 --> 55:48.871
- Did you check McRyan's tyre?
- No. Why should I?

55:48.971 --> 55:51.081
It has a bullet hole. He was killed.

55:51.181 --> 55:54.293
- Says you. Everybody else says accident.
- Who?

55:54.393 --> 55:58.422
I got a special commission formin' here
that's gonna say it was an accident.

55:58.522 --> 56:00.048
That's gonna say it was?

56:00.148 --> 56:04.428
They have no evidence. They don't have
the tape, the tyre, they didn't speak to me.

56:04.528 --> 56:09.808
I know all about you and your fuckin'
tapes. You put a lotta good cops away.

56:09.908 --> 56:12.519
That has nothin' to do with this,
and I resent it.

56:12.619 --> 56:15.355
I think you stink.
That's what it's got to do with it.

56:15.455 --> 56:19.693
Hey, you. Just because I don't like you
does not mean I'm not gonna do my job.

56:19.793 --> 56:24.656
Now gimme that tape. I'll send it over
to the lab and I'll have it checked out.

56:24.756 --> 56:29.036
I want you to look at that film I made from
those photos. I think you'll get the idea.

56:29.136 --> 56:32.915
But if we can get Karp's original film,
this gunshot'll be a lot clearer.

56:33.015 --> 56:36.752
Karp is makin' a bundle
sellin' his pictures to magazines.

56:36.852 --> 56:39.421
What makes you think he'll give 'em to us?

56:39.521 --> 56:42.716
- He's got to. It's evidence.
- I can't find him, Terry.

56:42.816 --> 56:46.261
- It's your job, man.
- Don't tell me how to do my goddam job.

56:46.361 --> 56:49.681
He could tell us what he was
really doin' with his camera.

56:49.781 --> 56:52.100
Nobody wants to know. Nobody cares.

56:52.200 --> 56:55.979
No sordid details.
No political assassination. Accident.

56:56.079 --> 56:59.274
This guy's dead. None of this shit's
gonna do him any good now.

56:59.374 --> 57:01.985
This isn't for him. I know he's dead.

57:02.085 --> 57:06.323
Don't you understand? If they can get
away with killing McRyan, who's next?

57:06.423 --> 57:09.368
Who's 'they'? First tell me who 'they' is.

57:09.468 --> 57:14.998
Is it a communist conspiracy? Or maybe
it's ayatollahs in the street with blowguns.

57:15.098 --> 57:18.293
- Oh, give me a break.
- Save your paranoia for public TV.

57:18.393 --> 57:20.003
Fuck you. I'm leaving.

57:20.103 --> 57:25.592
Put those pictures down, or I'll have you
arrested for withholding evidence.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.553
Is that right?

57:27.653 --> 57:31.557
All right. I'll be at the office all day.
You can get me there.

57:31.657 --> 57:34.122
I'll call you. Don't call me.

57:41.250 --> 57:43.283
- It's Burke, sir.
- What?

57:44.336 --> 57:46.196
It's Burke, sir.

57:46.296 --> 57:50.450
- Burke. What have you done?
- I don't understand the question, sir.

57:50.550 --> 57:53.996
Are you crazy? You were just
supposed to get some pictures of him.

57:54.096 --> 57:56.582
Are you aware of what you're saying, sir?

57:56.682 --> 57:57.708
Where are you?

57:57.808 --> 58:04.013
I'm calling from a secure phone booth.
I suggest you call me back on same.

58:29.089 --> 58:31.214
Excuse me. Is Mr Karp in?

58:31.717 --> 58:33.410
- Could I go in?
- What for?

58:33.510 --> 58:36.455
- I just have to pick up some pictures.
- Are you anybody?

58:36.555 --> 58:41.001
- I'm one of his customers.
- You know, he had a lotta customers.

58:41.101 --> 58:42.961
- You're a reporter, ain't ya?
- No.

58:43.061 --> 58:46.381
- You want Karp's film.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

58:46.481 --> 58:50.677
If there was a law against lyin', I'd have
made a lotta collars today - Mr Customer.

58:50.777 --> 58:55.265
- I am a customer and I'd like my pictures.
- Yeah, he's a customer too.

58:55.365 --> 58:58.060
- He offered me a thousand bucks.
- Really?

58:58.160 --> 59:00.710
And his wife offered me three.

59:00.829 --> 59:03.857
Doesn't seem worth it
but I guess you had to be there, huh?

59:03.957 --> 59:07.152
Looks like Karp did
a little divorce work on the side.

59:07.252 --> 59:11.865
Didn't give a shit about his customers.
I found these in a heap under his bed.

59:11.965 --> 59:13.951
That's some baby picture.

59:14.051 --> 59:17.120
You were supposed to get pictures
of McRyan, not kill him.

59:17.220 --> 59:20.624
I understood
the objectives of the operation.

59:20.724 --> 59:23.043
I didn't kill him. It was an accident.

59:23.143 --> 59:26.630
You accidentally
shot out the tyre of his car?

59:26.730 --> 59:30.759
As you may recall, this was my plan
as proposed at our meeting of June 6.

59:30.859 --> 59:33.637
We rejected that plan.
Don't you remember?

59:33.737 --> 59:36.890
I do admit I had to exceed
the parameters of my authority.

59:36.990 --> 59:39.768
But I stayed within
an acceptable margin of error.

59:39.868 --> 59:44.273
After all, the objective was achieved.
He was eliminated from the election.

59:44.373 --> 59:49.117
Burke, I don't know you.
I've never seen you.

59:49.253 --> 59:53.782
- Don't ever call me again.
- Just a minute. We got some loose ends.

59:53.882 --> 59:56.326
I changed the tyre
so it looked like a blowout.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.830
I erased the sound guy's tapes
so he'll seem like a crackpot.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.207
Karp's disappeared, but I'll find him.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.751
But that still leaves the girl.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:09.673
I've decided to terminate her and make it
look like one of a series of sex killings.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:13.677
- This would secure our operation.
- What operation?

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.013
Come on, Betty. Try again.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:24.444
Take 28.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.651
Cut.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.488
- Cut.
- Speak into the mike. They can't hear.

01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:34.621
Oh, Christ. Cut.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:39.292
All right, uh... switch.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:43.583
Betty, you pull the hair. Jean, you scream.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.640
Take 29.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.933
- Sam. I'll be in my room.
- Hey. Where the fuck have you been?

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:03.352
I had some business to take care of.

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:04.978
Shut up.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:08.315
- I thought you were workin' for me.
- I am. What's the problem?

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.944
- We need the effects for the other reel.
- Fine. I'll get 'em.

01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.905
I haven't even got the scream
for the first reel.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.005
Yes.

01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:11.605
Why don't you answer your phone?
It's the police.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.024
- Who's been in here today?
- Some guy...

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:17.444
- What guy?
- I don't think I like your tone of voice.

01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:24.409
- Yes?
- What is wrong with you?

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:28.164
- What?
- Your fuckin' tape had nothin' on it.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.040
All my tapes are blank.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.877
I don't get you. First you feed me
all this nutty assassination shit.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.046
Then you give me a blank tape. What for?

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:39.258
Because somebody erased it.
They've erased all my tapes.

01:03:39.358 --> 01:03:42.594
Oh. Oh, yeah. 'They' -
they erased your tapes.

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:47.964
Are they gonna be tryin' to kill you next?
You're fuckin' nuts.

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:55.405
Sally? It's Jack.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.278
Listen to me. I have to show you
that film that I made.

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:02.948
So just stay there. I'm coming right over.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:14.501
- Is Jack Terry here?
- Sure.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.004
- Frank Donahue. Channel...
- Debby.

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:21.779
- There he is now.
- Jack. How are you? I'm Frank Donahue.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:24.720
- Eye on the City News.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.181
- Could I talk to you?
- No. Not right now.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:31.727
Come on. Two minutes. That's all I need.
I came all the way here. Two minutes.

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:34.730
- What do you wanna talk about?
- It's sort of private.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.899
Can we go back here and talk?

01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:39.209
- Uh... yeah.
- Great, great.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:45.115
So you make movies here, huh? I think
I'm a frustrated actor myself, Jack.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.248
What do you want?

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:51.455
You told the police that someone
shot out the tyre on McRyan's car.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:55.000
- Who told you that? Who told you?
- Jack, that's not important.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.160
I'm a reporter. I've got my sources.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:02.633
Why would a guy like you be interested in
some kind of assassination nut like me?

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:04.766
Jack, I don't think...

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:08.981
- Can we talk in here?
- No. No, no, no. Over here.

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:14.812
What do you mean, a nut?

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:17.731
I don't think you're a nut.
That's why I'm here.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:21.568
I've looked into this thing,
and a helluva lot of things don't add up...

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:25.405
...about this... what are the cops
calling it-- a freak accident?

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:29.910
I mean, that girl-- everyone's pretending
she wasn't in the car. You saw her.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.995
What else did your source say?

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:36.583
Well, among other things,
that you recorded that gunshot.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.294
Great work, Jack.
I'd sure like to hear the tape.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:45.344
- I could've made it in a recording studio.
- Well, you could have but...

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.386
I don't think you did.

01:05:47.486 --> 01:05:51.932
I think you got a tape, Jack,
and I think it's the real thing.

01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:56.436
Let me put you on the air. Tell everybody
what you saw that night, what you heard.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:06:01.942
And then-- boom. We play that tape.
It's a great story. What do you think?

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:06.530
- It's bullshit. Nobody'd believe it.
- Hey. Frank Donahue believes it.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:11.160
And he's got eight million people
every night that watch him.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:14.371
Go along with me. I guarantee you,
by 8:30 tomorrow night,

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:21.271
every one of those eight million sons of
bitches will believe Jack Terry's story.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:01.627
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Just before the tyre blew out.

01:07:01.727 --> 01:07:03.921
You're right. It was a shot.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:07.925
- You took this to the police, huh?
- Yes. I gave them a copy.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:10.093
They sent it to the lab and it was blank.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.679
- So somebody's erased it.
- Are you sure?

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:17.476
I transferred it myself, I played it back and
now it's blank, like the rest of my tapes.

01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:23.148
OK. Calm down. The sound is very clear.
It's the picture that's a little fuzzy.

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:26.652
Shit. They'd say I made it up in the lab,
and they'd be right.

01:07:26.752 --> 01:07:30.906
Whoever's in on this has contacts with
the police. They want McRyan to vanish.

01:07:31.006 --> 01:07:33.742
They don't wanna hear about my gunshot.

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:35.953
- Gee, what are you gonna do?
- What?

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:39.373
- What are you gonna do?
- You mean, what are we gonna do?

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:42.292
- What do I have to do with this?
- Cut the shit, Sally.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:46.213
- I know what you were doin' in that car.
- What do you know?

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:48.924
You and Karp were settin' up
McRyan for blackmail,

01:07:49.024 --> 01:07:52.761
gettin' scummy pictures of him
gettin' laid after the Liberty Ball.

01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:56.265
You tell him running water
under a well-lit bridge gets you hot?

01:07:56.365 --> 01:08:00.519
- Who told you that?
- I saw your motel candid-camera shots.

01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:03.814
You got nice tits. Who was paying you
to flash 'em for McRyan?

01:08:03.914 --> 01:08:06.525
I wasn't in the car.
Or haven't you read the papers?

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:10.988
Henry's cover-up won't last. I just talked
to a reporter who knows everything.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:15.325
They have erased my tapes, they've made
you disappear, and next it's gonna be me.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:18.036
- But I'm not disappearin'.
- Yeah? I am.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.663
- It could be permanent.
- What do you mean?

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:24.209
- We did meet in a car wreck under water.
- But that was an accident.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:27.462
- Manny wouldn't get me hurt.
- Didn't he get you into the car?

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:33.256
- Yeah, but he didn't know...
- He didn't know the tyre'd be shot out.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.095
- He couldn't have.
- Come on, Sally.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:43.676
If I hadn't been there to pull you out of the
river, you'd be dead now. Don't you get it?

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:47.733
Sit down. Come on.
I wanna hear everything.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:50.694
Just start right from the top. Come on.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:55.698
It was just a job, like all the others. I'd get
'em into bed and Manny'd get it on film.

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:57.408
Them. Who's 'them'?

01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.621
Husbands, city officials,
mostly small-town guys.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.754
Why?

01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:07.252
- The money.
- Oh, you need the money that bad?

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:09.171
Come on. You know where I work.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:14.301
I get paid to smile my ass off and show
the 27 different lipsticks they're pushin'.

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:17.720
You know how much I make?
Shit is what I make. And I can't type.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:20.974
So it doesn't leave a helluva lot, you know?

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.935
So I did it.

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:26.104
I didn't really have to
do anything like screw 'em.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:29.316
- Just make it embarrassing. I know.
- Yeah, right.

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:34.529
Manny said if a guy stuck his hand in the
cookie jar, he deserves to get it cut off.

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:36.990
Can't cheat an honest man, right?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:41.680
I guess I wanted to believe it.
It just made it easier.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:46.500
- OK. McRyan. What about him?
- Manny got me into the Liberty Ball.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.212
I went over to McRyan, told him how great
he was, and he was very hot to show me.

01:09:51.313 --> 01:09:54.424
So we slipped out the back
and took off in his car.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:58.554
- Who hired Manny to take these pictures?
- I don't know.

01:09:58.654 --> 01:10:02.933
Don't you think Manny knew that his
client was planning to shoot out the tyre?

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:04.059
No.

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:08.063
- It wouldn't pay to tell you, would it?
- Manny wouldn't do that.

01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:10.774
- Didn't he wanna make an extra buck?
- Yeah.

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:13.861
Cos he's makin' big bucks now.
What's your cut?

01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:16.488
- I got paid.
- Underpaid, probably.

01:10:16.588 --> 01:10:19.950
- What do you care?
- I'm sick of bein' fucked by these guys.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:24.288
First Henry gets me to shut up to preserve
the reputation of the great governor.

01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:28.625
Then I find instead of gettin' laid he gets
murdered, and nobody wants to know.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:32.337
Nobody wants to know about conspiracy.
I don't get it.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:35.799
Let me tell you somethin'.
I know what I heard and what I saw.

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:39.511
I'll make sure everyone in this
fuckin' country hears and sees it too.

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:44.391
And you're gonna help me. You find
your pal Karp and get that original film.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:46.602
This isn't any good. I need the original.

01:10:46.702 --> 01:10:51.106
Cos if we don't get this on television for
everybody to see, they'll close the book.

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:55.027
And any loose ends, like you or me,
are gonna be cut right off.

01:10:55.127 --> 01:10:58.322
you can be crazy or dead. Either will do.

01:10:58.422 --> 01:11:03.494
All right. I'll try and get the film. Then will
you just leave me alone about all this?

01:11:03.594 --> 01:11:06.330
I wish I was the only one
you had to worry about.

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:10.125
- You're doin' a good job of scarin' me.
- I'm tryin' to save our asses.

01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:13.455
I'll look after my own ass, thank you.

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:36.109
- Things aren't adding up, Manny.
- Yeah? Like what?

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.445
- There you go.
- How did I end up in that car?

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:40.948
Come on, sit down. Have a seat.

01:11:41.048 --> 01:11:44.910
How did I end up in that car
in the bottom of the creek?

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:49.790
Listen. The guy's drivin' along
and all of sudden he has a blowout.

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:53.460
It wasn't a blowout, Manny.
Somebody shot out the tyre.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.421
What are you talkin' about?
How do you know that?

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:59.222
I know. I just know.

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:02.078
- Now, who was it?
- It was nobody.

01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:05.920
Come on, Manny. Just level with me.

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:11.812
All right. This nut, he calls me
a couple of weeks ago...

01:12:11.912 --> 01:12:14.857
...and he says he's workin'
for some candidate.

01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:19.444
Some candidate that's interested
in gettin' McRyan out of the race.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:21.613
Sounds like a normal Joe, right?

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:25.576
He says he's heard about our fine
divorce work and offers me six grand.

01:12:25.676 --> 01:12:28.126
Six? You told me three.

01:12:29.471 --> 01:12:32.374
Yeah, well... three before and three after.

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:35.210
So when were you gonna
tell me about the three after?

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.710
After I collected it. When do you think?

01:12:39.356 --> 01:12:41.356
Yeah. Sure.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:44.161
Hey. What's the matter with you?

01:12:44.486 --> 01:12:48.015
You think I'm pulling your leg?
You don't believe me?

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:52.686
Listen. How was I gonna be sure
that this guy was gonna come through?

01:12:52.786 --> 01:12:56.899
I mean, six grand-- that's a lotta money
for this kind of a job, huh?

01:12:56.999 --> 01:13:00.611
- I'd say he got his money's worth.
- He wasn't supposed to die.

01:13:00.711 --> 01:13:04.323
He wasn't even supposed to get hurt.
That was an accident.

01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:06.116
I figured it out later.

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:12.247
This nut's idea was to shoot out the tyre
of McRyan's car, cause a little crackup.

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:15.626
- The police come, pull him outta the car...
- With me?

01:13:15.726 --> 01:13:19.806
Yeah, yeah, with you.
And I'd get it all on film.

01:13:20.856 --> 01:13:22.972
Some little crackup.

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:25.844
He wasn't supposed to die.
That was an accident.

01:13:25.944 --> 01:13:29.089
How many times I gotta tell you that?

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:32.221
Manny, we got him killed.

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:34.228
Oh, hey, wait. We?

01:13:34.328 --> 01:13:38.488
What do you mean, we, huh?
We didn't do nothin'.

01:13:38.624 --> 01:13:43.070
I was in the woods, you were in the car.
I didn't shoot out no tyre. Neither did you.

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:47.783
So, please, don't give me
none of this conscience shit, huh?

01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:55.422
Besides, nobody is exactly cryin'
over the way things turned out.

01:13:55.974 --> 01:13:58.669
What would've happened
if the guy had lived?

01:13:58.769 --> 01:14:01.505
His career was finished, thanks to us.

01:14:01.605 --> 01:14:04.889
This way the guy comes out ahead.

01:14:05.025 --> 01:14:10.556
He's a saint, a martyr. Christ,
they passed one of his bills this morning.

01:14:10.656 --> 01:14:12.856
You're a pig, Manny.

01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:17.944
- And I'm a pig too.
- What the hell is with this 'pig' shit?

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.193
We gotta tell the truth before the books
are closed and the loose ends are cut off.

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:24.903
What are you talkin' about?

01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:28.240
McRyan was murdered
and everybody should know that.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:33.710
Are you crazy? We got him killed.
Do you wanna go to jail?

01:14:33.845 --> 01:14:37.457
Yeah, but I was in the car
and you were in the woods.

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:41.134
You think anybody is gonna believe that?

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:43.297
I don't know but I gotta do somethin'.

01:14:43.397 --> 01:14:47.176
Yeah, like just keep your mouth shut
and take the money.

01:14:47.276 --> 01:14:52.139
Hey, babe. This is the biggest thing
since the Zapruder film.

01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:54.308
- I don't care.
- It's bigger.

01:14:54.408 --> 01:14:57.400
This is history we got here, girl.

01:14:57.536 --> 01:14:59.688
This is gonna be a goddam fortune.

01:14:59.788 --> 01:15:03.484
It's gonna be in every newspaper.
It's gonna be in every magazine.

01:15:03.584 --> 01:15:06.445
It's gonna be on the fuckin'
six o'clock news.

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:09.156
They're gonna build TV specials
around this thing.

01:15:09.256 --> 01:15:12.367
And they're gonna ask
a goddam fortune for it.

01:15:12.467 --> 01:15:16.961
Hey. Don't you understand,
sweetheart? We're set.

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:22.878
I don't care. I don't want any part of
this thing. You can keep your three after.

01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:26.096
Hey, don't be such a dope, huh?

01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:28.264
Money's money.

01:15:29.818 --> 01:15:33.138
We sound like a couple of vultures.

01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:38.338
Pigs, vultures... You swallow
a whole box of animal crackers?

01:15:40.454 --> 01:15:43.774
I need a drink, Manny.
Come on, give me a drink.

01:15:43.874 --> 01:15:48.719
- Yeah, sure I'll get us a drink.
- Just give me the bottle.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.701
Hey, now you're thinkin', babe.

01:15:54.801 --> 01:16:00.411
- We'll go over to Atlantic City maybe.
- I don't like Atlantic City.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:03.293
- No? I'll show you around.
- Stop. Come on.

01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:06.338
- We'll have a lot of good times.
- Manny, stop.

01:16:06.438 --> 01:16:11.134
- We'll have a lotta laughs.
- Please, Manny, don't. Don't do this.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:14.310
Manny, please. Please.

01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:18.356
Relax, baby.

01:16:56.488 --> 01:16:58.557
Fantastic. Ah.

01:16:58.657 --> 01:17:00.690
Great.

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:05.002
- Well? Now what?
- You're great.

01:17:05.122 --> 01:17:08.609
I'm gonna call that TV guy.
We're gonna get it on the air.

01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:11.403
- Can I make you somethin' to eat?
- Yeah, fine.

01:17:11.503 --> 01:17:14.648
- How about some cornflakes?
- Anything.

01:17:18.343 --> 01:17:21.413
Frank Donahue, please. It's Jack Terry.

01:17:21.513 --> 01:17:25.256
- Yeah?
- Jack Terry calling.

01:17:25.392 --> 01:17:27.759
- Mr Donahue?
- Jack. Yeah.

01:17:27.894 --> 01:17:30.672
I've changed my mind.
I want you to hear that tape.

01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:35.761
I've also got Karp's film. If you run 'em
together, it's clear it wasn't an accident.

01:17:35.861 --> 01:17:41.683
That's great, Jack. Look, I can't talk now.
Can I get back to you in 20 minutes?

01:17:41.783 --> 01:17:44.728
I don't know why.

01:17:44.828 --> 01:17:46.861
She wanted me to do it.

01:17:47.247 --> 01:17:51.783
She asked for it.
She begged me for it, the bitch.

01:17:51.919 --> 01:17:55.120
I... I didn't wanna do it.

01:17:55.255 --> 01:17:58.581
She made me do it.

01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:01.386
You ask her. She'll tell you.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:05.676
- OK. Where is she?
- I don't know. Somewhere.

01:18:06.266 --> 01:18:12.506
In that big hole, near the Reading Market,
where they're buildin' somethin'.

01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:15.634
But don't listen to her. She made me do it.

01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:18.369
OK. Just tell me where you are.

01:18:19.196 --> 01:18:21.196
Where...

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:25.727
Listen, Jack. You realise this won't mean
a thing unless you come on the air...

01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:28.063
...and you say it's what you saw and heard?

01:18:28.163 --> 01:18:31.567
- I'll say it's what I heard.
- OK. That's great.

01:18:31.667 --> 01:18:35.612
Jack, what about that girl? She must
have heard it. Can we get her on?

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.198
No. She did, but don't involve her, OK?

01:18:38.298 --> 01:18:42.792
- Why not?
- She's not exactly proud of what she did.

01:18:42.928 --> 01:18:46.623
OK. No problem, Jack.
But could I at least talk to her?

01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:51.211
- Well, that's up to her. I...
- OK. Look, I'll take care of that.

01:18:51.311 --> 01:18:53.839
Jack, could you hold on just one second?

01:18:56.650 --> 01:19:00.220
- Jack, when can I see this stuff?
- Uh, any time.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.932
Great. Can I give you a call
this afternoon? Where can I reach you?

01:19:04.032 --> 01:19:08.312
- I'll be home all day.
- OK. I'll call you then. So long.

01:19:08.412 --> 01:19:10.814
- Oh, hi.
- I just spoke to Donahue.

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:14.318
- Who's he?
- A TV newsman. Does investigative news.

01:19:14.418 --> 01:19:16.713
Oh, I don't watch the news.

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:18.753
What?

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:21.575
- What's he wanna do?
- He said he'd put it on the air.

01:19:21.675 --> 01:19:24.161
- He'd call later and set up a meeting.
- Great.

01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:28.040
He also said he'd like me to go on TV
and say that it's what I saw and heard.

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.542
Said the tape wouldn't be
any good without it.

01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:35.589
- But he'd also like you to go on too.
- Oh, no. I don't want any part of it.

01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:39.092
Well, I know you don't,
but would you at least speak to him?

01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:41.434
No, I don't want to.

01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:44.598
Come on, Sally. They can't say
we're both hearing things.

01:19:44.698 --> 01:19:48.352
If we get this out in the open,
there's no one that can hurt us.

01:19:48.452 --> 01:19:50.813
All right, I'll think about it, OK?

01:19:50.913 --> 01:19:56.026
At City Hall this morning, Chief Inspector
Mackey held a news conference.

01:19:56.126 --> 01:19:59.655
He said a preliminary investigation
into Governor McRyan's death...

01:19:59.755 --> 01:20:02.491
...revealed that he was the victim
of a freak accident.

01:20:02.591 --> 01:20:04.117
- Bullshit.
- Also in the news...

01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:06.537
...is the bizarre sex killing of Mary Robert,

01:20:06.637 --> 01:20:10.123
a 22-year-old receptionist
from the Center City area.

01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:14.169
Her body was found at 10 a.m.
in the Reading Terminal excavation site...

01:20:14.269 --> 01:20:18.944
...after police received a tip
from an anonymous caller.

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:32.521
The girl had been strangled,

01:20:32.621 --> 01:20:36.859
then repeatedly stabbed with a pointed
instrument across her stomach and groin.

01:20:36.959 --> 01:20:40.112
The stab marks were
in the pattern of a Liberty Bell.

01:20:40.212 --> 01:20:43.949
The police are at a loss
to explain this grotesque mutilation.

01:20:44.049 --> 01:20:46.493
We asked forensic psychologist
Dr Joseph Fuchs...

01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:50.164
...what connection there might be
between the bell-shaped wounds...

01:20:50.264 --> 01:20:52.583
...and the upcoming
Liberty Day celebration.

01:20:52.683 --> 01:20:55.627
- Hi. This is Sally.
- Hi, Sally. Frank Donahue here.

01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:58.130
Yeah, you were supposed to call Jack.

01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:02.467
It's the damnedest thing. I can't get Jack
on the phone to arrange a meeting.

01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:07.931
His line's been busy
all day. So I thought I'd give you a ring.

01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:10.031
Yeah? So?

01:21:27.509 --> 01:21:31.163
Something's wrong with your phone.
I kept gettin' a busy signal.

01:21:31.263 --> 01:21:34.249
What do you mean?
I've been waitin' for Donahue's call.

01:21:34.349 --> 01:21:38.128
- He was gettin' a busy signal too.
- How do you know that?

01:21:38.228 --> 01:21:41.298
He called me. We're meeting
at 30th Street Station at five.

01:21:41.398 --> 01:21:42.841
How did he get your number?

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:44.927
- Didn't you give it to him?
- No.

01:21:45.027 --> 01:21:47.805
Well, reporters have a way
of gettin' numbers.

01:21:47.905 --> 01:21:53.685
- So I'll give him the tape and the film.
- Why didn't he call me back?

01:21:53.827 --> 01:21:56.772
He wants to meet me alone,
to talk me into goin' on the air.

01:21:56.872 --> 01:21:58.982
No, he should've called me back.

01:21:59.082 --> 01:22:01.985
- Your phone is out of order.
- It is not out of order.

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:04.780
I've been here all day.
I made a phone call.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.430
Here. Listen.

01:22:07.716 --> 01:22:11.161
- Maybe the phone company's in on it.
- No, something's not right.

01:22:11.261 --> 01:22:15.541
Let's just meet him. I'll give him the tape
and the film and get it over with.

01:22:15.641 --> 01:22:18.531
Once he's got the film, that's it.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:23.006
All right. He wants to meet you, right?

01:22:23.106 --> 01:22:25.592
- Yeah.
- OK. You're gonna go and meet him.

01:22:25.692 --> 01:22:28.387
If he sounds OK,
you'll give him the film and tape.

01:22:28.487 --> 01:22:30.889
- Where are you gonna be?
- Close.

01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:34.049
- I don't get it.
- I'm gonna wire you.

01:22:34.201 --> 01:22:36.019
Wire me? What for?

01:22:36.119 --> 01:22:41.474
I'm gonna cover all the bases.
Nobody's gonna fuck me this time.

01:22:42.292 --> 01:22:46.488
This way, if he disappears with the film,
he can't deny it cos I got him on tape.

01:22:46.588 --> 01:22:49.449
Aren't you gettin' a little paranoid here?

01:22:49.549 --> 01:22:53.453
He's a newsman. This is a very big story.
Why isn't he gonna put it on the air?

01:22:53.553 --> 01:22:57.875
Look what happened when I took it
to the police. They erased it, right?

01:22:57.975 --> 01:23:01.170
- What are you doin'?
- Making a copy, to cover ourselves.

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:04.095
Yeah? Well, what about the film?

01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:07.342
I can't make a copy now.
I don't have time to do that.

01:23:07.442 --> 01:23:10.262
- OK, OK. Bring on the wire.
- Take off your coat.

01:23:10.362 --> 01:23:12.657
OK. Let's get it over with.

01:23:27.045 --> 01:23:31.325
- So you travel a lot, huh?
- Oh, yeah. I been all over the place.

01:23:31.425 --> 01:23:33.410
Yeah, I travelled once.

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:38.290
So, uh... you say you got
about 60 minutes and about 60 dollars?

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:40.959
- Oh, no. Did I say that?
- Yeah, you did say that.

01:23:41.059 --> 01:23:45.797
No, I think... about 20 minutes
and about 20 dollars is what I've got.

01:23:45.897 --> 01:23:49.760
Gee, it's too bad you don't have
about 40 minutes and about 40 dollars.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:53.096
- Yeah, that's too bad.
- Yeah, that's too bad.

01:23:53.196 --> 01:23:56.683
What I've got is about 20 minutes
and about 20 dollars.

01:23:56.783 --> 01:24:00.062
The trains are never on time.

01:24:00.162 --> 01:24:02.439
They're notorious. Know what I mean?

01:24:02.539 --> 01:24:05.442
I bet you at least got 30 minutes. At least.

01:24:05.542 --> 01:24:09.071
- Do I have to have 30 minutes?
- At least 30 minutes.

01:24:09.171 --> 01:24:14.743
You know, I believe I do have
about 30 minutes and about 30 dollars.

01:24:14.843 --> 01:24:17.579
Great. I'll make a quick phone call...

01:24:17.679 --> 01:24:20.791
...and meet you in the back
of the waiting room in two minutes.

01:24:20.891 --> 01:24:25.379
That should be two dollars off but... we'll
let you go this time. Know what I mean?

01:24:25.479 --> 01:24:28.549
No, I don't know what you mean.
You know what I mean?

01:24:28.649 --> 01:24:31.709
- See ya.
- Yeah. I know what you mean.

01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:37.564
Hey, Ralphie.

01:24:40.619 --> 01:24:42.914
I gotta have a 20.

01:24:48.627 --> 01:24:53.121
Just enjoy your puppet show.
Have a good Liberty Day.

01:25:49.104 --> 01:25:53.383
- Slower. Aw, shit.
- Some hotshot sailor you are.

01:25:53.483 --> 01:25:57.721
That's ridiculous. Why don't you grow up
and learn a thing or two, sailor boy?

01:25:57.821 --> 01:26:01.476
I've been on a sh...
Ten for you, baby. Ten.

01:26:01.783 --> 01:26:07.648
- Hey, what about my $30? You fuck.
- You blew it. You know what I mean?

01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:10.323
Shit.

01:28:44.279 --> 01:28:48.308
...Attention, please.
This will be the last call...

01:28:48.408 --> 01:28:53.559
...for the Broadway Limited
to Pittsburgh and Chicago.

01:28:54.623 --> 01:28:59.451
All passengers travelling
all the way to Chicago,

01:28:59.586 --> 01:29:03.997
and passengers holding space
in car 4140...

01:29:22.734 --> 01:29:26.763
- Aren't you overdoin' this a little bit?
- We've got nothin' to lose.

01:29:26.863 --> 01:29:31.101
If I had any sense, I'd take this stuff
and dump it in the trash, and that'd be it.

01:29:31.201 --> 01:29:35.063
- Yeah, but I got the original at home, so...
- So why all this?

01:29:35.163 --> 01:29:38.692
Because of Manny's film. I told you.
We gotta be careful with it.

01:29:38.792 --> 01:29:45.082
You know, the only real trouble
I ever got into was when I was too careful.

01:29:47.175 --> 01:29:49.286
Give me a sound level. Count to 10, slow.

01:29:49.386 --> 01:29:51.538
- One, two, three, four...
- No, just normal.

01:29:51.638 --> 01:29:54.750
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:57.836
- All right.
- Come on. We gotta get goin' here.

01:29:57.936 --> 01:30:00.506
- Look, don't forget you got this on, OK?
- OK.

01:30:00.606 --> 01:30:03.008
If you need me, talk to me. It's right there.

01:30:03.108 --> 01:30:05.141
OK. Affirmative.

01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:10.070
- Sally, come here.
- What?

01:30:10.782 --> 01:30:12.782
Thank you.

01:30:18.206 --> 01:30:20.240
Over and out.

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.374
Hello, Jack? Can you hear me?

01:31:17.474 --> 01:31:22.254
Like I was saying before about goin'
to New York. We could see some shows.

01:31:22.354 --> 01:31:27.301
You know, like Sugar Babies. And I know
a great hotel in the Times Square area...

01:31:27.401 --> 01:31:28.969
Sally?

01:31:29.069 --> 01:31:32.431
- Hi. I'm Frank Donahue.
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

01:31:32.531 --> 01:31:35.267
Would you mind
walking with me for a moment?

01:31:35.367 --> 01:31:36.935
Where are we goin'?

01:31:37.035 --> 01:31:39.897
- I think we got a little problem.
- What's that?

01:31:39.997 --> 01:31:42.030
It sounds crazy but...

01:31:43.041 --> 01:31:46.951
I think we're being followed.
Yeah. No problem.

01:32:13.113 --> 01:32:15.724
...Gee, you're a fast walker.

01:32:15.824 --> 01:32:18.852
Well, in my business
you gotta be fast on your feet.

01:32:18.952 --> 01:32:22.481
- Where's Jack?
- Uh... Oh, he's at home, resting.

01:32:22.581 --> 01:32:25.734
- The pressure can get to you.
- Which train are we takin'?

01:32:25.834 --> 01:32:31.699
- I don't know yet. Got the tape and film?
- Yeah, right here in my bag.

01:32:45.687 --> 01:32:49.925
- I guess we lost him, huh?
- Well, we can't be too careful.

01:32:50.025 --> 01:32:55.806
Tell you what. Walk slowly down to the
end of the platform right in front of me.

01:32:55.906 --> 01:32:59.351
I don't know why you think
anyone'd wanna follow us anyway.

01:32:59.451 --> 01:33:02.771
You'd be amazed what some people
would do for a story like this.

01:33:02.871 --> 01:33:05.315
- Yeah, I guess so.
- No, don't turn around.

01:33:05.415 --> 01:33:08.318
- We don't wanna give ourselves away.
- Yeah, right.

01:33:08.418 --> 01:33:12.413
Just pretend like
nothing's happened, all right?

01:33:22.849 --> 01:33:25.878
Just look at this place.
This is disgusting.

01:33:25.978 --> 01:33:29.756
- Yeah. It's a real shame.
- And it's not even safe any more.

01:33:29.856 --> 01:33:33.385
It reminds me of that story
about that guy in New York. Remember?

01:33:33.485 --> 01:33:37.639
- Yeah, I think we did a piece on him.
- He'd ride the subways at rush hour.

01:33:37.739 --> 01:33:41.351
He'd stand in the corner real quiet
so's nobody'd notice him.

01:33:41.451 --> 01:33:46.190
Then they'd pull in to a station, he'd open
his coat and pull out a big meat cleaver,

01:33:46.290 --> 01:33:48.150
and whack 'em right over the head.

01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:52.237
- Let's go, Sally.
- And then they had this transit strike.

01:33:52.337 --> 01:33:56.116
He just disappeared.
It was like he went on strike too.

01:33:56.216 --> 01:33:57.743
So I don't ride the subways.

01:33:57.843 --> 01:34:01.330
It's not safe. I wouldn't even
come down here if it wasn't for you.

01:34:05.434 --> 01:34:07.211
Speak up. Come on.

01:34:07.311 --> 01:34:13.686
You see what I mean? See that creepy
character? It's just not safe any more.

01:34:16.445 --> 01:34:17.805
The train's coming.

01:34:17.905 --> 01:34:20.265
Franklin Bridge Express.

01:34:20.365 --> 01:34:21.934
Is that where we're goin'?

01:34:22.034 --> 01:34:25.604
- Where? Come on.
- That where they're having the fireworks?

01:34:25.704 --> 01:34:28.607
That's right.
They got a nice bar down there.

01:34:28.707 --> 01:34:33.487
Why don't we have our drink and
our little chat, then take in the fireworks?

01:34:33.587 --> 01:34:35.155
Sure, OK.

01:34:35.255 --> 01:34:38.784
- Want to help me cover the story?
- All right.

01:34:38.884 --> 01:34:41.995
- You could give us the woman's angle.
- Yeah.

01:34:42.095 --> 01:34:44.560
Franklin Bridge Express, huh?

01:34:47.309 --> 01:34:49.309
Hey.

01:34:55.025 --> 01:34:57.475
Sally. Sally.

01:34:58.153 --> 01:35:01.515
- So what's the big deal with Liberty Day?
- Did you see our story?

01:35:01.615 --> 01:35:05.015
I don't watch news. It's too depressing.

01:37:01.276 --> 01:37:03.486
Somebody get an ambulance.

01:37:04.112 --> 01:37:06.146
Try that back door.

01:37:20.796 --> 01:37:22.829
Is it 16 or 35?

01:37:22.965 --> 01:37:26.739
- What do you mean?
- The gauge of the film.

01:37:26.885 --> 01:37:30.038
They've only got 16mm equipment
out at the station.

01:37:30.138 --> 01:37:33.333
- I think that's what it is.
- Why don't you let me have a look?

01:37:33.433 --> 01:37:35.377
- Oh, sure.
- Come into the light.

01:37:47.864 --> 01:37:49.516
Here it is.

01:37:49.616 --> 01:37:51.733
- Got the tape too?
- Yeah.

01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:55.830
Yeah, that's 16 all right.

01:38:02.212 --> 01:38:04.422
Are you... wrappin' it up?

01:38:12.681 --> 01:38:15.048
What did you do that for?

01:38:15.976 --> 01:38:17.976
Jack's gonna kill you.

01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:25.110
Oh, God, no. No.

01:38:34.828 --> 01:38:37.463
One more sound and you're dead.

01:38:40.542 --> 01:38:46.079
Come on, Sally. We're gonna
cover the fireworks, remember?

01:39:53.574 --> 01:39:55.607
Jack, please.

01:40:04.626 --> 01:40:06.993
Jack. Please.

01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:09.129
No.

01:40:11.842 --> 01:40:14.459
God, Jack...

01:43:18.195 --> 01:43:20.389
...Hello, Jack? Can you hear me?

01:43:20.489 --> 01:43:25.394
Like I was saying before about goin'
to New York. We could see some shows.

01:43:25.494 --> 01:43:28.647
You know, like 'Sugar Babies'.
And I know a great hotel...

01:43:28.747 --> 01:43:33.527
...Two more young women
were killed by the Liberty Bell Strangler.

01:43:33.627 --> 01:43:37.281
But the tragedy ended when
the final victim, Sally Badina,

01:43:37.381 --> 01:43:41.618
killed her attacker in a bloody struggle
on the top of the Port of History building...

01:43:41.718 --> 01:43:44.454
...during the Liberty
Day firework celebration.

01:43:44.554 --> 01:43:48.333
The identity of the strangler
has not yet been determined.

01:43:48.433 --> 01:43:53.005
Governor McRyan's death continues to
send shock waves throughout the nation.

01:43:54.856 --> 01:43:56.550
...Oh, Jack.

01:43:56.650 --> 01:44:01.269
Oh, God. Oh, please.

01:44:08.328 --> 01:44:11.048
...Jack, please.

01:44:11.665 --> 01:44:15.116
Oh, God. God, Jack.

01:44:19.047 --> 01:44:20.574
Now, that's a scream.

01:44:20.674 --> 01:44:22.951
- How was the level?
- More on the scream.

01:44:23.051 --> 01:44:25.537
- I don't wanna distort it.
- Come on. Bring it up.

01:44:25.637 --> 01:44:30.292
- All right. I'll give it more the next time.
- That's wonderful.

01:44:30.392 --> 01:44:36.257
- What'd you think of the rest of the mix?
- Uh, OK. On the beginning...

01:44:37.566 --> 01:44:39.599
It's a good scream.

01:44:39.901 --> 01:44:41.901
It's a good scream.

01:44:42.112 --> 01:44:44.112
It's a good scream.
