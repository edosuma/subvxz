[Clears throat] I’m gonna go

10:28.360 --> 10:34.933
vote before the game.

10:30.196 --> 10:35.934
okay.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.971
What?

10:38.204 --> 10:40.872
do we need to draw you a map?

10:40.105 --> 10:41.773
A map?

10:41.907 --> 10:43.875
To sex town, Brian.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.810
'cause that's where you're

10:44.944 --> 10:47.445
you're having sex with jenny.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.313
Mm-hmm.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.150
What?

10:48.447 --> 10:50.949
No, stop being weird.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.983
think about it, dude.

10:52.117 --> 10:55.487
tonight after the big game.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.387
Just the two of you.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.389
She cook you a lot of

10:56.522 --> 10:59.291
dinners, Brian?

10:57.523 --> 11:01.930
I mean, she burned us popcorn

10:59.425 --> 11:02.294
once, and then we made out

11:01.227 --> 11:03.261
afterwards.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.796
Oh, my god.

11:03.395 --> 11:06.465
That was just popcorn, dude.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.332
Tonight you get the full course.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.300
Uh-huh.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.167
You’re getting dessert.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.435
Boom!

11:09.301 --> 11:11.503
Ah-roo-gah!

11:10.569 --> 11:12.471
Honk-honk!

11:11.637 --> 11:13.905
Yeah!

11:12.605 --> 11:15.874
You the man!

11:22.181 --> 11:24.500
The guy's a king.

11:29.154 --> 11:31.924
[Dial-up connections whirring]

11:33.993 --> 11:36.828
That’s three more votes

11:34.994 --> 11:41.466
from the puzzle gamers.

11:36.962 --> 11:43.301
Yes.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.403
[whispering] uh, Ki, can

11:43.435 --> 11:46.470
I talk to you for a second?

11:45.537 --> 11:48.406
Hi.

11:46.605 --> 11:50.308
You’re back.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.843
Hi.

11:50.442 --> 11:53.445
Um...

11:51.977 --> 11:54.312
So, about the M.M.O. guild...

11:53.579 --> 11:55.280
there's news on

11:54.446 --> 11:56.214
the M.M.O. guild?

11:55.414 --> 11:57.215
Do we have it confirmed?

11:56.348 --> 11:58.830
Will they hold?

11:57.349 --> 12:00.860
What?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.860
did we get their votes?

12:12.131 --> 12:14.132
Duh.

12:12.998 --> 12:16.670
Just talked to josh.

12:14.266 --> 12:18.203
Everything’s gonna be fine.

12:16.201 --> 12:21.473
[Applause]

12:18.337 --> 12:23.975
Everyone, we can do this.

12:21.607 --> 12:26.846
[All cheering]

12:24.109 --> 12:26.846
You’re the best, ted.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.517
This is a one-round game of

12:31.450 --> 12:33.885
hostage rescue.

12:32.651 --> 12:37.222
The first team to extract their

12:37.356 --> 12:41.827
Captains, have you picked your

12:39.725 --> 12:44.129
hostages?

12:41.961 --> 12:46.832
Jumpin' Jax.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.899
Ashley barnstormer.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.901
This guy.

12:52.404 --> 12:56.141
All right, bring it in.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.410
All right, this is the real

12:57.643 --> 13:02.347
deal, kids.

12:58.544 --> 13:03.848
This is your moment.

13:02.481 --> 13:05.450
If you win this game, you will

13:03.983 --> 13:07.170
have sex with my daughter.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.919
Get Jax on that helicopter,

13:07.152 --> 13:09.888
and we are going to the

13:11.190 --> 13:13.925
proud.

13:15.561 --> 13:18.964
You seem distracted.

13:16.562 --> 13:20.650
Did Jenny talk to you?

13:20.199 --> 13:23.968
About what's going to happen

13:21.600 --> 13:25.337
After the game?

13:24.103 --> 13:27.500
Oh. Um...

13:25.471 --> 13:28.139
Okay, I know this is awkward

13:27.139 --> 13:29.241
because I’m her mom, and

13:28.273 --> 13:30.141
whatever happens between you two

13:29.375 --> 13:31.376
is between you two.

13:30.275 --> 13:33.511
But I can't have it affecting

13:31.510 --> 13:35.513
your game out there.

13:33.645 --> 13:36.381
No, no, it won't.

13:35.647 --> 13:38.160
Really?

13:36.515 --> 13:41.419
Because you look pretty frazzled

13:38.150 --> 13:42.954
Right now.

13:41.553 --> 13:44.256
Okay, fine. Um...

13:44.390 --> 13:46.958
little bit, because, like,

13:45.557 --> 13:48.293
you know, it's a big change

13:48.427 --> 13:50.629
Well, change is coming,

13:49.428 --> 13:51.630
Brian, whether you want it to

13:50.763 --> 13:54.299
or not.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.166
and it's gonna hurt.

13:54.433 --> 13:58.360
It is?

13:55.300 --> 13:59.237
Yeah, it hurts.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.372
but jenny has dreamed about this

13:59.371 --> 14:03.740
her entire life, so don't ruin

14:01.507 --> 14:04.409
it for her.

14:03.208 --> 14:07.112
Okay, you go out there, and you

14:04.543 --> 14:07.112
do your job.

14:09.581 --> 14:11.884
Let’s do it.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.436
[Rapid gunfire]

14:43.849 --> 14:46.384
Brian d. is falling apart out

14:45.284 --> 14:47.920
there.

14:46.518 --> 14:47.920
Give that boy some crazy glue.

14:57.296 --> 15:02.567
[Gunshot]

14:59.598 --> 15:06.103
Oh, come on, Brian.

15:02.701 --> 15:09.174
Man, your team kind of sucks,

15:06.238 --> 15:10.342
Especially Brian.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.509
Well, good thing you won't have

15:10.476 --> 15:13.178
to play with them when you're in

15:11.643 --> 15:14.579
Paris this summer.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.714
[sighs] look, I get it.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.680
You put yourself in here to

15:15.848 --> 15:18.449
screw with me.

15:16.815 --> 15:21.119
It’s not gonna work.

15:18.584 --> 15:23.588
Jenny, you got me all wrong.

15:21.253 --> 15:25.900
I’m just lazy.

15:23.722 --> 15:27.920
Besides, the law has got this

15:25.224 --> 15:30.562
in the bag.

15:27.226 --> 15:33.310
You remember the law, don't you?

15:30.696 --> 15:34.132
[Telephone ringing]

15:33.165 --> 15:35.233
[Chirpy indistinct speech]

15:34.266 --> 15:36.334
But I thought we had a deal.

15:35.367 --> 15:39.690
[Chirpy indistinct speech]

15:36.468 --> 15:44.376
Okay.

15:39.204 --> 15:46.444
I understand.

15:44.510 --> 15:48.790
Everyone...

15:46.578 --> 15:49.714
I just got word that the RPG

15:48.213 --> 15:51.116
team voted for Shane.

15:49.848 --> 15:52.717
damn it!

15:51.250 --> 15:55.387
I thought we had it!

15:52.851 --> 15:55.387
walk it off, Sebastian.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.250
I thought we had it.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.564
Okay, so we're gonna tear

16:05.230 --> 16:07.732
down this wall for the shark

16:06.698 --> 16:09.401
tank, and I’m thinking that the

16:07.866 --> 16:10.335
zen garden can go right about

16:09.535 --> 16:11.236
here.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.103
Oh, hey, guys.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.771
don't mind us.

16:12.237 --> 16:13.637
What are you doing here

16:12.905 --> 16:14.639
Shane?

16:13.772 --> 16:15.640
Oh, I’m just getting a head

16:14.773 --> 16:16.508
start on some of my presidential

16:15.774 --> 16:17.475
duties.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.743
This is gonna be my office.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.711
This is our classroom.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.678
Oh, don't worry.

16:19.845 --> 16:22.280
it turns out there's an even

16:20.812 --> 16:23.448
grosser, smellier basement

16:22.414 --> 16:24.415
underneath this basement.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.283
It’s all yours.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.419
[clears throat]

16:25.417 --> 16:28.453
Um, Shane, you can't do this.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.788
This isn't how it works.

16:28.587 --> 16:31.156
Oh, man, no grape pop?

16:29.922 --> 16:32.690
Actually, they've got grape

16:31.290 --> 16:33.558
down at the student center.

16:32.824 --> 16:35.426
That’s all the way

16:33.692 --> 16:38.797
across campus!

Call my driver.

16:40.265 --> 16:43.235
Make sure it's Steven.

Mm, yeah.

O’doyle, you have yoga in the

17:04.690 --> 17:06.624
mornings, right?

17:05.824 --> 17:07.659
Well, yoga's hard work.

17:06.758 --> 17:08.792
I bet you wish you could have

17:07.791 --> 17:09.660
some super sour straws on your

17:08.925 --> 17:10.560
way back.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.429
Oi, they're my favorite

17:10.694 --> 17:12.297
candy, but you can only

17:11.563 --> 17:13.231
get them--

17:12.431 --> 17:14.980
In that vending machine next

17:13.365 --> 17:14.799
to the weird mural in the

17:14.233 --> 17:16.367
parking lot--

17:14.933 --> 17:17.469
Too long a walk between classes.

17:16.501 --> 17:18.837
What if I told you we could put

17:17.603 --> 17:20.605
them here in the vending machine

17:18.971 --> 17:21.739
next to Mr. Wong’s classroom.

17:21.873 --> 17:24.275
my language, Ki Swan.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.877

closer to the parkour funasium.

chocolate raisins on the way

17:35.254 --> 17:38.322

17:36.288 --> 17:42.160
to class, and you tell them

17:38.457 --> 17:43.862
that Ki swan personally promises

17:42.294 --> 17:45.196
that the snacks they want will

17:43.996 --> 17:46.831
be in the vending machines

17:45.330 --> 17:48.765
they need them to be in,

17:46.965 --> 17:50.735
to get the snacks that they

normally don't have time to get,

17:50.869 --> 17:54.339
but want!

18:14.760 --> 18:18.296
Ki needs these votes.

18:17.562 --> 18:19.164
All right?

18:18.430 --> 18:19.931
And I need your help,

18:19.298 --> 18:20.932
So let's go.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.838
Theodore, stealing Joshua’s

18:25.804 --> 18:28.773
virtual pet and threatening to

18:26.972 --> 18:30.275
kill it, that's one thing.

18:28.907 --> 18:31.576
that's cool.

18:30.409 --> 18:33.311
But to actually kill it and

18:31.710 --> 18:34.512
pretend it's alive?

18:33.445 --> 18:36.214
That messed up.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.182
You want to talk messed up

18:36.348 --> 18:39.617
to the guy who's been in

18:37.316 --> 18:42.520
detention for over three weeks?

18:39.751 --> 18:45.889
Now, help me with the body

18:42.654 --> 18:47.325
and teach me Photoshop.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.563
you drift, Ted.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.562
You go where we cannot follow.

18:54.900 --> 18:58.269
You’re a monster.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.437
Fine.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.738
I don't even need your stinkin'

18:59.571 --> 19:01.839
help anyway.

19:00.872 --> 19:03.675
I thought we were bros!

19:01.973 --> 19:06.778
Oh, my gosh.

19:03.809 --> 19:08.680
get me out of here.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.814

Jenny and I are doing it

19:42.547 --> 19:44.150
tonight.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.516
What?

19:44.149 --> 19:46.783
How is that a problem?

19:45.650 --> 19:47.652
[groans]

19:46.918 --> 19:49.853
I don't know, man.

19:47.786 --> 19:52.390
I’m really nervous about it.

Brian, you are literally

living every 16-year-old boy's

19:55.560 --> 19:58.562
You go to a Video Game High

19:57.829 --> 20:00.398
School.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.800
Your smoking-hot girlfriend

20:00.532 --> 20:04.302
wants to have sex with you.

20:02.934 --> 20:06.771
And for some reason, her mom is

20:04.436 --> 20:07.639
cool with it.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.539
You’re right.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.874
That is pretty awesome.

34:27.297 --> 34:29.764
You are a liar

34:28.733 --> 34:31.435
and a murderer.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.469
and I hope you totally choke

34:31.569 --> 34:34.670
on barf.

34:33.603 --> 34:35.705
Come on, Joshy.

34:34.804 --> 34:36.639
Okay, come on.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.507
Come on, it's okay.

34:36.774 --> 34:38.708
Come on.

34:37.641 --> 34:41.279
All right, come on.

34:38.842 --> 34:41.279
Okay, okay, come on, come on.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.387
What?

34:49.387 --> 34:51.255
We were going to lose,

34:50.521 --> 34:51.922
All right?

34:51.389 --> 34:56.159
They were being jerks.

34:56.293 --> 35:01.431
Look, Ki...

34:58.362 --> 35:03.767
I’m sorry, okay?

35:01.565 --> 35:08.272
But you're president now.

35:03.901 --> 35:10.339
That’s a good thing, right?

35:08.406 --> 35:11.241
Right?

35:10.474 --> 35:11.909
It’s just a freakin'

35:11.375 --> 35:14.112
virtual pet.

35:22.853 --> 35:26.390
Ki, you didn't know.

35:24.989 --> 35:28.459
This isn't your fault.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.459
You deserve to win.

35:33.898 --> 35:39.437
I cheated.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.437
I stuffed the ballot boxes.

35:42.673 --> 35:44.542
I’m sorry.

36:04.528 --> 36:06.629
Oh!

36:05.830 --> 36:10.234
You just bought yourself another

36:06.764 --> 36:10.901
week's detention, dillweed.

36:10.368 --> 36:13.304
Get out of here!

36:16.507 --> 36:19.310
[slurping]

37:32.550 --> 37:39.323
[Knock at door]

37:36.454 --> 37:39.323
[sighs]

37:44.829 --> 37:49.700
Ki left school.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.700
She’s gone.
