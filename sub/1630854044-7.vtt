bright and sweet girl.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.968

about a year ago,

35:05.003 --> 35:07.504
and paulie when to foster care
at age 9.

35:07.539 --> 35:10.507

-there is.

told him like that, but I did.

36:28.370 --> 36:30.887
Oh, you're so righteous
when it comes to blue, right?

36:30.923 --> 36:33.573
You know, you don't wanna
tell him things, you wanna
be honest about everything.

36:34.726 --> 36:35.575
And what's wrong with that?

36:36.611 --> 36:38.361
How does your commitment
to honesty

36:38.397 --> 36:41.581
factor in to you instructing
our son to lie to his mother?

36:41.616 --> 36:43.333
-That's not what I said.
-[scoffs] what'd ya say?

36:44.603 --> 36:46.002

talk to you first

36:46.054 --> 36:48.088
-because I wanted you
to hear it from me.
-Mmm-hmm.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.091
There's a difference.
Look, I'm sorry.

36:51.793 --> 36:52.893
-For tell--
-you're sorry?

36:54.613 --> 36:55.612
I don't believe you.

with my daughter.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.778
Without telling me.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.763
You got the nerve to tell me
that you don't trust me.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.450
You remember
what I said to you
at that parking lot?

37:20.906 --> 37:23.206
-Remember what I told you?
-Don't you do that.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.425
I said, "all I have to do
is think about your life

37:26.211 --> 37:27.794
whenever I thought
my life was bad."

37:29.548 --> 37:31.214
it's probably the worst thing
I could've said at the time.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.600
'cause my life was bad.

37:34.987 --> 37:36.987
But you know
what I think about
when I look at you today?

37:38.890 --> 37:39.773
You know what I see?

37:42.127 --> 37:44.778
I see somebody
who probably loves me
more than I love myself.

37:46.565 --> 37:47.597
On most days.

37:49.901 --> 37:50.984
And I'm sorry for it.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.621
Maybe it didn't come out
the right way, but...

37:54.656 --> 37:57.540
[inhales] that's why
I've been trying to talk.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.659
I can't do no more secrets.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.244
That's what messed up
the family, that's what...

38:02.114 --> 38:03.330
That's what we've been
running from.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.799
That's what's been
messing us up.

38:07.019 --> 38:08.802
So, what do we do now, darla?

38:09.755 --> 38:10.920
[sighs]

38:29.508 --> 38:31.107
-wow!
-What do you think, brother?

38:32.177 --> 38:33.777
-It's magical, bro.
-Morning.

to pick up an envelope
from you.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.448
Oh, yeah.
It's on the top left drawer.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.649
Hey, you! Come here.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.184
-I'll be back in two shakes,
all right?
-All right, bet.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.687
For the auction!
Know what, let me show you.

38:44.356 --> 38:45.755
Excuse me, doll.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.040
So, this is what I want...

38:48.327 --> 38:49.326
[remy] okay...

38:51.063 --> 38:54.097
-Tell me everything.
-[laughs] you!

38:54.132 --> 38:55.699
You got the most,
you go first.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.852
No, I don't think
I've got the most.

38:58.887 --> 39:01.438
You're the one
with all the books and movies.

39:01.473 --> 39:06.109
Hell, you got the wife,
kids, big job.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.527
-Okay. We're both
doing all right.
-Yeah.

-We are.

39:08.697 --> 39:10.363
[both chuckle]

39:10.399 --> 39:13.983
[sighs] it's wild seeing you
after all this time.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.552
You're the same,
but different.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.187
Grown.

39:17.222 --> 39:19.489
-Why, thank you.
-[both chuckle]

39:21.560 --> 39:24.060
no, you know,
I feel grown...

39:24.996 --> 39:27.630
'cause I feel settled,
finally.

39:27.666 --> 39:28.781
You know what I mean?

39:28.800 --> 39:33.720
We all have to find
what settled means to us
and...

39:33.755 --> 39:35.755
You know, I guess I found it.

39:37.843 --> 39:38.908
Have you?

39:42.280 --> 39:44.881
Wow. That's a good question.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.935
I guess,
if I had to think about it...

39:50.288 --> 39:54.774
I'm not,
but I'm closer than I was.

39:54.809 --> 39:55.859
-Okay.
-[hollywood shouting] remy!

39:55.894 --> 39:57.694

-Yup, yup!
I'll see you there?
-[nova] definitely.

40:02.300 --> 40:05.235
And thank you.

40:05.270 --> 40:08.271
This plan, if it works,
we'll get our land back.

40:08.306 --> 40:11.741
It's huge. It's everything
we want and need.

40:14.813 --> 40:15.945
It's gonna work.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.892
I'm gonna get
another cup of coffee
before we leave.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.160
-All right.
-[billie chuckles]

40:32.998 --> 40:35.865
[sighs] it's good
to see remy, wasn't it?

40:35.901 --> 40:39.235
It is. It's strange, though.

40:39.287 --> 40:42.539
So many people from my past
have come back into
my life recently.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.040
I kind of don't know
what to make of it.

40:44.075 --> 40:47.811
I feel like it's all
trying to tell me something,
but I don't know what.

40:47.846 --> 40:48.678
[hesitates] I...

40:50.148 --> 40:52.048
I'm babbling. [laughs]

40:52.083 --> 40:54.484
-I'm sorry.
-[billie] oh, girl.
No, don't worry about that.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.085
You sorting through
your past like that?

40:57.472 --> 41:01.491
I mean,
it changed my life,
changed everything.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.927
Seeing you girls right now
reminds me of the time

41:03.962 --> 41:05.678
ernest and I were
talking about you.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.632
Yeah, it was...

41:11.870 --> 41:13.203
It was a hard day.

41:14.673 --> 41:18.141
<i> Billie, it was</i>
<i> your mama's funeral.</i>

41:22.514 --> 41:24.047

41:29.321 --> 41:31.421
-[ernest] you all right?
-Yeah, I'm good.

41:31.456 --> 41:32.555
Thank you for coming.

41:37.462 --> 41:38.294
[sighs] mmm.

41:39.998 --> 41:44.200
-You didn't have
to make that drive.
-You kidding?

41:44.236 --> 41:47.103
I wouldn't have missed it.
How you holding up?

41:47.138 --> 41:49.072
Oh, you know,
best I can.

41:50.075 --> 41:51.641
Trying to deal
with billie.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.344
She wasn't going to come...

41:54.379 --> 41:56.513
To her mother's funeral
if it was in louisiana.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.548
Swore she was never
coming back to st jo.

41:59.701 --> 42:01.518
[scoffs]

42:01.553 --> 42:04.204
-that girl's a handful,
ain't it?
-[chuckles]

42:04.239 --> 42:07.156
you got that right.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

42:07.876 --> 42:09.375
[chuckling] sit down.

42:15.267 --> 42:18.368
Prosper,
count it as a blessing.

42:18.403 --> 42:22.405
Claire was in billie's life
as an adult.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.277
I think that's one
of the things with nova.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.613
Trudy wasn't there
to help guide her...

42:31.516 --> 42:32.682
Tell her things...

42:34.452 --> 42:36.352
That I can't tell her
or couldn't tell her.

42:36.388 --> 42:37.687
I didn't know how.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.293
When...

42:44.296 --> 42:45.361
Me and trudy...

42:46.398 --> 42:49.165
Finally broke up,
that last time,

42:49.200 --> 42:50.800
she said to me,
she said...

42:55.307 --> 42:56.406
She said, "ernest...

42:57.943 --> 43:00.677
Love goes its own way,

43:00.712 --> 43:03.796
You can't force it
or make it go your way.

43:05.717 --> 43:06.816
If you smart...

43:08.169 --> 43:09.786

Our daughters...

43:21.633 --> 43:23.816

43:25.337 --> 43:27.153
When they come
to understand that...

43:28.740 --> 43:30.573
It doesn't matter
how love comes...

43:32.277 --> 43:35.478
Rich, poor, man, woman...

43:37.449 --> 43:39.682
Black, white...

43:42.621 --> 43:45.989
Here or hereafter...

43:48.493 --> 43:51.361
It flows its own way...

43:53.264 --> 43:56.349
And you gotta flow with it.

44:11.049 --> 44:14.584
Co-op funds, charley's meal
collateral, and hollywood
and vi's contribution

44:14.619 --> 44:15.885
we had 250 k.

44:15.920 --> 44:19.055
And then that big,
anonymous donation
out of d.C.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.673
Brought us to 450,000.

44:20.725 --> 44:23.643
And betty's farm
as collateral gave...
Another...

44:23.678 --> 44:24.761
75 k.

44:24.796 --> 44:26.396
So then we put in
the movie money

44:26.431 --> 44:28.264
we've got 750 k to bid with.

44:30.185 --> 44:31.768
So if none of the farmer's
bid against us,

44:31.803 --> 44:33.269
we might actually have a shot.
