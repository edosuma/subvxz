02:24.709 --> 02:26.711
<i>Meanwhile,
in the state of Oklahoma,</i>

02:26.842 --> 02:28.931
<i>today is
the scheduled day of execution</i>

02:29.061 --> 02:30.759
<i>for Edward Wayne Brady,</i>

02:30.889 --> 02:32.674
<i>and, kids,
all it took was just</i>

02:32.804 --> 02:34.937
<i>a string
of cold-blooded murders,</i>

02:35.067 --> 02:36.547
<i>incontrovertible evidence,</i>

02:36.678 --> 02:38.419
<i>a confession,
a jury of his peers</i>

02:38.549 --> 02:40.856
<i>and 11 years
of legal wrangling</i>

02:40.986 --> 02:42.205
<i>to get us to game day.</i>

02:42.336 --> 02:44.381
<i>I mean, what the heck
is wrong with us?</i>

02:44.512 --> 02:46.078
<i>I mean,
can somebody please tell me</i>

02:46.209 --> 02:48.516
<i>why this guy
is still sucking air?</i>

02:48.646 --> 02:52.041
<i>How is this guy still alive?</i>

02:54.739 --> 02:55.697
<i>He's expected.</i>

02:55.827 --> 02:57.133
<i>Let him through.</i>

03:33.648 --> 03:34.997
Dr. James Martin here

03:35.127 --> 03:37.869
for the psychiatric evaluation
of Edward Wayne Brady.

03:38.566 --> 03:39.784
Are you currently
in possession

03:39.915 --> 03:42.352
of any alcohol, tobacco,
firearms or narcotics?

03:42.483 --> 03:43.788
No.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.790
Just turn off your ignition,
step from your vehicle

03:45.921 --> 03:47.792
with your identification
in hand.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.275
Step over here, please.

03:58.847 --> 03:59.848
Turn around.

04:02.459 --> 04:03.634
One to come through.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.811
Step through, leave your keys
and phone in the pass through.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.907
Welcome to the least
happy place on Earth.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.258
- Warden Tom Moss.
- Nice to meet you.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.129
Thanks for filling in
on short notice.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.479
No offense, but I'd rather
not be here at all.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.307
Yeah. You and everybody else.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.744
Look, why don't you just
sign off, and we'll be done.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.312
Unfortunately,
that's not the way it works.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.358
Everyone deserves
an impartial review.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.969
Not everyone. Follow me.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.276
Sorry to hear

04:36.406 --> 04:38.408
about Dr. Fischer.
Did you know him?

04:38.930 --> 04:40.062
I did. Yes.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.325
He was, uh,
something of a mentor to me.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.893
Yeah, well, I tell you this,
his timing sucked.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.069
Every time this guy Brady's
number comes up,

04:47.199 --> 04:48.418
something happens.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.074
Execution scheduled
for 11:00 p.m.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.380
That's not
for public knowledge,

04:53.510 --> 04:55.556
so please don't convey that
to anyone.

04:55.686 --> 04:56.731
We're going
to need your decision

04:56.861 --> 04:58.472
by 4:00 p.m. at the latest,

04:58.602 --> 05:00.038
if we're gonna stay
on schedule.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.170
If there's any problems,

05:01.301 --> 05:02.911
I'd rather know sooner
than later.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.087
If we're gonna
do my job properly,

05:05.217 --> 05:06.567
we're gonna need some privacy.

05:06.697 --> 05:09.613
No, it's not a problem.
He's been taken from his cell.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.789
You'll be meeting him
in a common area.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.225
Normally,
that's where we allow

05:13.356 --> 05:16.054
last contact with family,
but he doesn't have any.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.360
From there, he'll be showered,

05:17.491 --> 05:19.188
taken to the holding cell
in the Death House

05:19.319 --> 05:21.233
not far from
the execution chamber.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.627
That's where he'll be spending
his last couple hours.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.369
I'm assuming you already
reviewed the Fischer files?

05:26.500 --> 05:27.762
Yes.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.764
Then you already know
he's a master manipulator.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.635
Absolute genius.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.594
And right now,
his entire existence

05:33.724 --> 05:35.160
is focused on one thing.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.424
Convincing you
he's totally insane.

05:37.554 --> 05:38.642
And therefore incapable

05:38.773 --> 05:40.035
of being executed
under state law.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.341
Yeah.

05:41.471 --> 05:42.516
You listen to him,

05:42.646 --> 05:44.344
by the time
he's done with you,

05:44.474 --> 05:45.606
he'll have your head
so twisted around

05:45.736 --> 05:47.390
you'll think
you're the killer, not him.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.715
So you think
it's all an act?

06:07.845 --> 06:09.717
Of course it is. Open up.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.546
Well, for what it's worth,
Fischer disagreed with you.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.112
Just wasn't sure whether
the root of the problem

06:14.243 --> 06:15.549
was psychotic or psychogenic.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.509
Whether it stems
from his brain

06:19.640 --> 06:21.163
losing its grip on reality

06:21.293 --> 06:23.034
or some mental
or emotional stressor.

06:23.644 --> 06:24.949
That's the problem
with you shrinks.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.647
Too smart
for your own damn good.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.736
Can I have a radio, please?

06:28.866 --> 06:30.912
Look,
Brady knows what's coming.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.522
He's playing the system,

06:32.653 --> 06:34.742
and if you allow him to,
he'll play you, too.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.049
Look, I get lied to
all the time.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.748
Figuring out the truth
behind the lie

06:40.878 --> 06:42.402
is what I get paid to do.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.709
Take this.
If you need anything,

06:45.840 --> 06:47.842
there's always somebody
monitoring that channel.

06:57.721 --> 06:58.722
Thanks.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.477
Morning.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.654
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm, uh...

07:17.785 --> 07:19.482
Dr. James Ansel Martin.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.659
Valedictorian,
University of Chicago.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.313
Bachelor of Science, biochemistry.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.358
Salutatorian, Johns Hopkins.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.404
Medical School with
a residency in Psychiatry.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.189
Currently, the youngest
full professor on staff at OU.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.322
It's not exactly...

07:33.453 --> 07:37.239
Stanford, but then again
we are in Oklahoma, aren't we?

07:38.240 --> 07:40.329
Guttmacher award recipient,
author of numerous articles,

07:40.460 --> 07:43.201
American society
of psychiatry.

07:44.942 --> 07:47.249
Once engaged, never married
and father of none.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.947
You want to have
a seat right there,

07:50.078 --> 07:51.383
have a little chat with me?

08:01.959 --> 08:03.221
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.223
I'm hoping you'll answer them.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.574
I'd like you to be
as comfortable as you can.

08:07.704 --> 08:10.838
Do you know what the first
thing they will do to me is

08:10.968 --> 08:12.535
once I've been
pronounced dead?

08:13.014 --> 08:13.928
I'm afraid I don't.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.233
Autopsy.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.151
It just seems odd, doesn't it?

08:20.282 --> 08:21.892
I mean,
all that cutting

08:22.676 --> 08:24.155
and weighing of organs.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.854
I mean, certainly they'll know
what the cause of death is.

08:26.984 --> 08:27.985
I'm just...

08:28.943 --> 08:30.988
It just seems strange, right?

08:31.119 --> 08:32.512
And why bother?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.646
I suppose to make sure
the job is done.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.649
Well, it's just a little
barbaric, don't you think?

08:39.780 --> 08:42.086
I assume you know
Dr. Fischer has passed away.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.349
Come on now.
He committed suicide.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.700
I know that
because I made him do it.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.530
Why would you do that?

08:51.443 --> 08:52.749
Serving my purpose.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.882
You're here, aren't you?

08:55.012 --> 08:56.405
Why would you want me here
instead of him?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.581
- I didn't like him.
- And you like me?

08:59.408 --> 09:03.630
Well, no, but I chose you
because I need you

09:04.674 --> 09:05.806
to do something for me.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.634
See,
you're gonna write my story.

09:08.765 --> 09:09.766
And why would I do that?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.029
Because I want you to.

09:12.639 --> 09:13.727
I see.

09:13.857 --> 09:18.427
Well, not sure you do,
but you will soon.

09:18.775 --> 09:22.083
How can you be so sure?
Are you, um, are you God?

09:22.213 --> 09:23.824
Don't play with me, James.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.652
You continue
to ask stupid questions,

09:25.782 --> 09:26.870
and I'll end this session.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.524
Well, that would be
unfortunate for you

09:28.655 --> 09:30.004
because I'd have to
make my determination

09:30.134 --> 09:31.614
based upon
limited information.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.922
- And you think that scares me?
- Oh, it should.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.404
I mean, it, it would me.
Being so near to death.

09:41.058 --> 09:43.539
Death doesn't scare me, James.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.497
And why is that?

09:46.890 --> 09:48.675
Because I can't die.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.547
See, James,

09:52.592 --> 09:53.810
I'm a demon.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.126
Do you have a name?

10:05.256 --> 10:06.257
Of course I have a name.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.345
Would you like me
to call you by it?

10:07.476 --> 10:08.825
Depends. Do I call you James?

10:09.565 --> 10:11.262
- I'd prefer Dr. Martin.
- Of course you would.

10:11.741 --> 10:14.701
It's my title. I, uh, I worked
very hard to achieve it.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.790
And it preserves the nature
of our relationship.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.008
We can do that.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.096
As long as you agree
to acknowledge

10:19.227 --> 10:20.402
my honorifics as well.

10:20.532 --> 10:21.490
Which is?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.405
Lord High Prince.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.712
I, um...

10:26.582 --> 10:28.628
- I won't be doing that.
- Okey-dokey.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.412
And since we're gonna be
on a first-name basis,

10:30.542 --> 10:31.805
I guess I'll allow you
to use mine.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.154
- Edward?
- No.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.764
That's merely the name
of the host body,

10:34.895 --> 10:36.200
the shell which I inhabit.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.811
I no longer answer to it.

10:38.550 --> 10:39.682
The name
my master gifted to me

10:39.813 --> 10:40.857
is in a Phoenician dialect

10:40.988 --> 10:42.424
that hasn't been spoken
for 3,500 years,

10:42.554 --> 10:44.948
but I'll give you the nearest
English equivalent,

10:45.079 --> 10:47.777
which would be Nefariamus.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.257
Nef... Nefarious?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.520
A closer translation would be
"He who is nefarious

10:51.651 --> 10:52.869
"suggesting possession
of trade full measure."

10:53.000 --> 10:54.436
And Nefarious isn't
a real name.

10:54.566 --> 10:55.611
Says who, James?

10:57.439 --> 10:59.615
<i>Cephas</i> meaning "rock,"
or in Latin <i>Petrus,</i>

10:59.746 --> 11:00.703
wasn't a name
until the carpenter

11:00.834 --> 11:02.270
gave it to that
obnoxious fisherman.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.750
Not a good name until it is.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.056
Somebody uses it,
it becomes a name.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.231
You...
You seem a bit defensive.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.580
Names are important.

11:09.581 --> 11:10.844
They have power.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.107
They let everyone know
who we are.

11:15.805 --> 11:19.200
Ain't that right, Jimmy?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.513
I'm sorry if I offended you.
That wasn't my intention.

11:28.644 --> 11:29.732
Of course it was.

11:30.907 --> 11:34.171
What's a little malice
between friends?

11:39.611 --> 11:40.656
What's so funny?

11:49.012 --> 11:50.144
I have a secret.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.233
Something you'd like to share?

11:52.363 --> 11:55.323
I don't think
you're gonna like it.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.064
Well, how will I know
unless you tell me?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.808
Are you sure you wanna know?

12:01.938 --> 12:03.723
I think it would be useful.

12:07.509 --> 12:08.945
Okay, James.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.688
Before you leave here today,

12:12.819 --> 12:14.777
you will have committed
three murders.

12:18.781 --> 12:19.826
I don't think so.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.523
Has nothing to do
with your thoughts,

12:21.653 --> 12:24.004
your wants,
your yesses or your nos.

12:24.134 --> 12:27.050
It simply is, it's a fact,
it'll happen because I say so.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.926
Aren't you
at least curious, James,

12:33.056 --> 12:34.362
to who you're gonna murder?

12:34.492 --> 12:36.146
No, because I have no
intention of killing anyone.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.931
I would however,
rather than discussing

12:38.061 --> 12:40.194
hypothetical murders
that will never happen,

12:41.108 --> 12:44.024
like to discuss the actual
murders that did occur.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.548
Murders that
you were involved in.

12:46.678 --> 12:47.767
You mean the ones I committed.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.334
You were convicted of six
murders. Were there more?

12:50.465 --> 12:51.727
- Of course there were.
- How many more?

12:51.858 --> 12:54.164
Innumerable. Been at this
a long time, James.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.123
My work pre-dates
your concept of history.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.516
Well, let's...
Let's limit our discussion

12:58.647 --> 12:59.735
to Edward Wayne Brady.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.302
Fine. Eleven.
Six I was convicted of,

13:01.432 --> 13:02.694
one suspected of,
and another four

13:02.825 --> 13:03.739
that they don't have
the capacity

13:03.870 --> 13:04.914
to possibly figure out.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.222
And how do you feel
about that?

13:08.352 --> 13:09.789
Another stupid question, James.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.313
What do you think?
I'm ecstatic.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.447
Edward, not so much.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.233
Why isn't Edward
as happy as you are?

13:20.321 --> 13:21.888
Because on occasion,

13:22.018 --> 13:25.587
I make him do things
that he doesn't want to do.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.939
Well, if Edward doesn't
want to do them,

13:30.070 --> 13:31.332
why does he do them then?

13:33.073 --> 13:34.944
Do you believe
in demonic possession?

13:36.598 --> 13:37.904
The idea
of a malevolent entity

13:38.034 --> 13:39.035
controlling a person's
thoughts and actions.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.471
- Do you believe that?
- No.

13:42.604 --> 13:43.561
Well, then, you won't believe

13:43.692 --> 13:44.649
anything I'm about
to tell you.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.999
It's not important
what I believe.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.522
What's important right now
is what you believe.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.306
Demons don't have beliefs, James.

13:50.220 --> 13:53.136
We have knowledge. We know.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.443
Okay. Um...

13:56.183 --> 13:58.141
When did you possess Edward?

13:58.272 --> 13:59.751
Doesn't work that way.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.885
Can't just possess someone.
We need a series of yesses.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.191
So you're saying
it's a process?

14:04.321 --> 14:05.366
- Of course it's a process.
- How does it work?

14:05.496 --> 14:07.281
- It's complicated.
- Try me.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.893
I'm smarter than you think.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.330
Oh, you're smarter
than I think.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.550
Okay, James.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.639
We offer up
a series of temptations

14:17.769 --> 14:18.770
gradually increasing

14:18.901 --> 14:20.424
in terms of duration
and intensity.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.861
Degree of moral inequity.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.124
Absence of baptism
in this case

14:24.254 --> 14:26.169
allows us to begin work
long before the age of reason.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.476
At three, age of five,

14:28.606 --> 14:31.261
maybe, a theft of a toy car
can do a great deal.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.437
Then we move on to
bigger and better things.

14:33.568 --> 14:37.267
At eight, grandmother's gift
of a Ouija board

14:37.398 --> 14:39.139
gives immediate access
to his decision-making.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.749
So, we began steering them,
without him bothering,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.056
calling into question exactly
who was doing the steering.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.579
Enough yesses
and a few enough noes

14:44.709 --> 14:46.276
gives increasing rights
over the victim's

14:46.407 --> 14:47.625
physical and mental processes.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.019
Did that...
Did that track, James?

14:51.368 --> 14:55.111
It seems random.
Almost, um, unfocused.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.460
Well, that's what
we want you to think.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.420
We have a level of focus
beyond your comprehension.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.944
As a matter of fact,
everybody around him,

15:02.075 --> 15:03.903
friends, family, they didn't
even notice the changes.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.339
It happened so incrementally,

15:05.469 --> 15:07.080
police thought it was
Eddie being Eddie.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.473
We know exactly
what we're doing,

15:09.604 --> 15:11.127
when, where,
and how he's giving consent,

15:11.258 --> 15:12.476
and the exact moment
that we achieved

15:12.607 --> 15:14.130
each new degree of control.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.305
"Degree"?

15:15.827 --> 15:17.742
Control of the host body
comes in degrees.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.790
There's stages, each with its
own name and characteristics.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.226
And those are?

15:24.053 --> 15:25.620
From top to bottom,
extreme temptation,

15:25.750 --> 15:26.751
obsession, infestation,

15:26.882 --> 15:28.275
finally possession, subjugation.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.190
- And Edward Wayne Brady...
- Fully subjugated.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.365
That's why we're having
this conversation.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.542
Yes, we... We own him.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.240
"We"?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.373
All those who dwell below.

15:39.503 --> 15:40.896
My master's very generous
with the toys

15:41.027 --> 15:42.289
he gives his children
to play with.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.596
Subjugation with an "S."

15:52.081 --> 15:54.214
Did you know that Dr. Fischer

15:54.344 --> 15:56.433
came to the conclusion that
you were non compos mentis?

15:56.564 --> 15:57.957
Completely insane. Yes. Yes.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.436
Yeah, so then,

15:59.567 --> 16:02.874
why did you theoretically
drive him to kill himself?

16:04.528 --> 16:05.616
Wouldn't he have
helped accomplish

16:05.747 --> 16:07.183
what you're seemingly
trying to do here?

16:09.359 --> 16:10.795
Which is what, James?

16:10.926 --> 16:12.232
To save yourself
from execution

16:12.362 --> 16:14.321
by convincing us
that you're insane.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.192
You silly boy, James.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.804
I think you misunderstand.

16:20.849 --> 16:24.635
See, I want to be executed.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.077
I thought you said
you couldn't die.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.339
I can't.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.517
But he can.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.651
We no longer need him, James.
Our work with him is done.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.524
And it's time for him
to go to hell.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.362
This is Dr. James Martin
in the rotunda.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.668
Is there a chaplain
on standby?

16:57.799 --> 16:58.800
<i>Yes.</i>

16:58.930 --> 17:00.193
<i>He's just arrived.</i>

17:00.323 --> 17:02.282
Can you send him in please?
Thank you.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.544
<i>Copy that.</i>

17:03.674 --> 17:05.067
What are you doing, James?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.419
You know, theology isn't
my area of expertise,

17:09.550 --> 17:10.594
so, um...

17:11.291 --> 17:12.814
I thought I'd get
a professional opinion.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.685
You're making a mistake.

17:14.816 --> 17:15.817
Are you...
Are you threatening me?

17:15.947 --> 17:16.948
Yes.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.428
What are you gonna do?

17:18.559 --> 17:21.388
Well, if I'm just a man
like you think I am, not much.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.607
But if I am who I say I am...

17:23.738 --> 17:26.567
Well, that would probably be
very intimidating if, um...

17:29.613 --> 17:31.398
If I weren't an atheist.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.704
You ignorant sack of meat.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.838
You think your atheism
will protect you?

17:38.492 --> 17:40.711
"Oh, I don't believe
in angels or demons,

17:40.842 --> 17:42.017
"heaven or hell.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.498
"So you can't hurt me."

17:45.803 --> 17:46.891
Hell is full
of pathetic trash.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.545
who thought
exactly like you do.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.852
Boldly proclaiming their ideas

17:50.982 --> 17:52.549
on how they feel
the universe operates.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.160
Never once
contemplating the possibility

17:54.290 --> 17:55.378
that they could be wrong.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.208
And you should see them now, James.

17:59.339 --> 18:03.517
Edward, do... Do you
understand why I'm here?

18:05.171 --> 18:07.042
Do you realize
I have the power

18:07.173 --> 18:09.392
to save you or condemn you?

18:09.523 --> 18:11.699
What I understand, James,

18:11.829 --> 18:14.876
is you would have no power
over me whatsoever,

18:15.006 --> 18:18.097
if it hadn't already
been given to you from below.

18:26.017 --> 18:29.108
Probably just
a coincidence, Jimmy.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.333
No!

18:37.855 --> 18:39.422
Nobody wants you here, priest!

18:39.814 --> 18:41.337
Nobody needs you!

18:41.990 --> 18:43.209
On the contrary.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.820
I invited him here.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.694
Thank you for coming.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.305
Father Louis.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.263
I'm fine with just Louis...

18:54.394 --> 18:55.351
...or Lou.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.527
Dr. James Martin.
Have you, um...

18:58.963 --> 19:00.356
Have you met with him before?

19:00.487 --> 19:03.185
No. I tried.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.970
He's always refused
spiritual counseling.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.757
What do you want
with me, Son of God?

19:09.887 --> 19:12.803
Come here to torture me
before the appointed time?

19:13.848 --> 19:14.805
He claims he's a demon.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.807
Carpenter send you to gloat?

19:17.460 --> 19:18.853
Unfortunately for you,
I'm not one

19:18.983 --> 19:20.463
that could be cast out
so easily though, am I?

19:20.594 --> 19:24.815
Insanity always has been
an issue here, hasn't it?

19:25.468 --> 19:26.469
Hmm.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.081
Sadly, movies and TV have
filled our heads with images

19:30.212 --> 19:32.258
that are largely metaphorical.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.955
Not meant
to be taken literally.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.046
I'm not here
to hurt you, Edward.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.744
I'm here to help you.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.442
To put you at your ease.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.661
Make sure you're comfortable.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.968
Personally,
I've never met a demon.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.797
I've never been
part of an exorcism,

19:49.927 --> 19:51.277
nor do I expect to be.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.366
Many of the things
that bother us

19:53.496 --> 19:56.369
are just our own fears
and disordered thoughts.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.115
So...

20:09.991 --> 20:11.035
You...

20:13.690 --> 20:15.779
You don't consider
demonic possession

20:15.910 --> 20:17.781
to be a possibility?

20:18.782 --> 20:21.655
Our understanding
has evolved beyond that.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.353
Huh.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.707
Well, I appreciate you
telling me that.

20:31.882 --> 20:32.927
I feel...

20:34.755 --> 20:36.060
I feel much better.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.239
And, Lou,

20:42.110 --> 20:43.590
I was wrong about you.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.289
I should've had you
come and visit sooner.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.424
But I'm glad that you did.

20:51.554 --> 20:55.166
I am glad
that we're all getting along.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.081
Would you like me to stay?

20:57.212 --> 20:58.344
No, we're done.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.265
Well, if you...
If you need me...

21:10.312 --> 21:11.444
I'll be available.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.839
You'll be available, Lou?

21:15.970 --> 21:18.277
Right up until the time
you are...

21:19.756 --> 21:21.584
Right up until what, Lou?

21:21.976 --> 21:23.369
Right up until the sizzle?

21:24.326 --> 21:25.588
God bless you, son.

21:25.719 --> 21:28.461
Will you be available
until the sizzle?

21:28.591 --> 21:29.636
Lou!

21:29.766 --> 21:31.725
When, Lou?

21:32.203 --> 21:33.683
When, Lou?

21:44.868 --> 21:45.826
Now you understand

21:45.956 --> 21:47.871
that, uh,
Father Lou has confirmed

21:48.002 --> 21:51.788
that demons aren't
really a thing.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.574
Did you really think
that poser could help you?

21:54.704 --> 21:56.271
I'm still here, James.
I'm not going anywhere.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.794
You still have
to deal with me.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.622
You're being irrational.

21:59.753 --> 22:03.104
I am the most rational being
you will ever meet.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.935
Then give me something
to make me believe you.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.416
Prove to me you're a demon.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.116
Okay.

22:16.857 --> 22:17.945
Okay, James.

22:20.774 --> 22:21.992
Invite me in.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.648
Let me inhabit you.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.563
I'm not gonna do that.

22:27.694 --> 22:28.651
Why not, James?

22:28.782 --> 22:31.045
You're an atheist, remember?

22:31.175 --> 22:32.220
What are you afraid of?

22:32.351 --> 22:33.700
I'm not playing that game
with you.

22:33.830 --> 22:34.875
You're already playing it.
We're playing it together.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.398
Now play by the rules
and invite me in.

22:36.529 --> 22:37.573
No.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.880
So, for all your posturing,

22:40.794 --> 22:42.752
you're just a poser like him,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.842
afraid to test the validity of
your own convictions, that it?

22:49.411 --> 22:50.586
All right then.

22:51.805 --> 22:52.936
But if I agree,

22:53.067 --> 22:54.634
I get to make a request
as well.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.162
I'm starting to like you, James.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.120
Agreed.

23:04.774 --> 23:05.775
All right, then.

23:09.518 --> 23:10.824
Go ahead.

23:11.781 --> 23:12.826
Inhabit me.

23:13.914 --> 23:16.569
You have
my complete unfettered

23:16.699 --> 23:18.527
and irrevocable permission.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.138
Here I am.

23:24.228 --> 23:25.316
What are you waiting for?

23:29.364 --> 23:30.409
Go ahead. I'm...

23:30.931 --> 23:31.932
I'm still waiting.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.153
Hmm.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.157
Doesn't seem like
anything is happening.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.902
Yeah. Don't...

23:46.381 --> 23:47.513
Don't gloat.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.254
You think you've won
but you haven't.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.040
I got exactly what I wanted.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.259
You said that you would
prove to me you're a demon,

23:55.390 --> 23:57.174
but all you've done
is waste my time.

23:57.610 --> 23:58.611
My turn.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.222
I want to talk to Edward.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.444
Edward Wayne Brady.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.581
He's angry.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.636
He's... angry.

24:27.901 --> 24:32.993
He says he's
gonna do bad things to you.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.212
I'm, I'm sorry to hear that.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.781
You should listen to him
when he says stuff like that.

24:39.608 --> 24:40.609
He means it.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.917
He does, does...

24:45.092 --> 24:46.049
bad things.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.486
Makes, makes...

24:48.617 --> 24:52.795
Makes me do things
I don't wanna do.

24:53.535 --> 24:54.580
Who am I talking to?

24:58.235 --> 24:59.280
Edward.

24:59.759 --> 25:00.760
Edward.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.241
Did Dr. Fischer
mention the idea

25:04.372 --> 25:06.374
of dissociative disorder
to you?

25:06.853 --> 25:08.463
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

25:08.594 --> 25:10.813
And did he explain that,
that some people

25:10.944 --> 25:11.945
who have experienced trauma

25:12.075 --> 25:13.729
develop multiple personalities
to cope?

25:13.860 --> 25:15.296
I don't have that!

25:15.426 --> 25:19.169
I told them I don't have that.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.823
Then who's Nefarious?

25:26.916 --> 25:28.701
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.008
He...

25:35.011 --> 25:36.360
does bad things to me.

25:36.491 --> 25:40.800
Makes me do bad things.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.454
I can't stop him.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.195
Why not?

25:47.458 --> 25:48.721
Because he owns me.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.557
Did you like Dr. Fischer?

26:08.523 --> 26:09.742
He was nice.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.833
Well, did you know
that Dr. Fischer

26:13.963 --> 26:15.835
didn't believe
Nefarious was real?

26:16.618 --> 26:17.924
I tried to tell him...

26:18.054 --> 26:21.492
...and he wouldn't
listen to me that...

26:25.018 --> 26:28.587
Sometimes smart people
have a hard time believing

26:28.717 --> 26:31.111
stuff that
everybody else knows.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.768
So where's Nefarious now?

26:39.554 --> 26:40.599
He's listening.

26:41.948 --> 26:42.992
Is he always listening?

26:47.344 --> 26:49.042
Sometimes...

26:51.174 --> 26:53.742
he leaves me alone
to experience pain.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.442
I don't... I don't understand.

26:58.573 --> 27:01.924
He does bad things

27:02.055 --> 27:05.841
and then I get punished
for them,

27:05.972 --> 27:09.758
and the inmates,
they beat me, or...

27:12.239 --> 27:17.766
they send me
to solitary confinement.

27:18.419 --> 27:22.118
And he likes
when that happens.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.646
All right. You know what,

27:27.776 --> 27:30.083
we, we've talked
a lot about him, um...

27:31.214 --> 27:32.302
I'd like to know more
about you.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.826
- Would that be okay?
- Yeah.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.960
How would you describe
your childhood?

27:43.966 --> 27:45.054
What?

27:49.145 --> 27:50.451
He says you're gonna kill me.

27:50.581 --> 27:51.757
I don't kill anyone.

27:51.887 --> 27:54.237
He says that you could
stop it, but you won't.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.586
I haven't decided that,

27:55.717 --> 27:58.328
that's why we're
having this conversation.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.375
But, Edward,
we have to address the fact

28:01.505 --> 28:03.072
that you murdered
a number of people.

28:03.203 --> 28:07.294
No! No! He... made me!

28:07.424 --> 28:08.687
I didn't...

28:08.817 --> 28:10.384
Do you...
Do you honestly believe that?

28:10.514 --> 28:12.516
Yes! You don't... He's bad!

28:12.647 --> 28:13.822
He's bad, but what about you?

28:13.953 --> 28:15.084
Yeah.

28:15.563 --> 28:19.001
Bad. I've done stuff
that I'm not...

28:20.829 --> 28:21.961
proud of.

28:22.788 --> 28:23.963
I didn't...

28:26.400 --> 28:28.445
But at least...

28:34.060 --> 28:35.931
I didn't kill my mother.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.859
So how is Clara, James?

28:50.990 --> 28:52.295
I wasn't done
talking to Edward.

28:52.426 --> 28:55.081
But I'm done allowing you
to talk with him.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.212
At least for now.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.737
So how is she?

29:01.609 --> 29:03.437
Judging by what you
already know about me,

29:03.567 --> 29:06.483
I imagine you're well aware,
my mother is dead.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.749
You know, I was gonna
save this for later, James.

29:10.879 --> 29:13.447
But since we're
running short on time,

29:13.577 --> 29:16.450
remember how you said
you'd never kill anyone?

29:19.148 --> 29:21.455
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.762
I didn't kill my mother.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.067
Of course you did.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.373
Just 10 years ago,
you'd have been brought up

29:26.503 --> 29:27.591
on first-degree
murder charges.

29:27.722 --> 29:28.941
She was an Oregon resident.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.856
Everything was done
according to the law.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.335
Oh, the law.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.468
The law. That's right.

29:34.598 --> 29:37.645
Death with dignity.
Euthanasia. Assisted suicide.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.038
That certainly sounds better
than murder, doesn't it?

29:39.168 --> 29:40.169
She was in pain.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.478
And her prognosis
was terminal.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.523
Didn't hurt that she was worth
$3.6 million,

29:46.654 --> 29:48.482
and you were
the sole heir though, did it?

29:48.612 --> 29:49.918
But, hey, I get it, James.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.487
She was old, inconvenient. Definitely...

29:53.966 --> 29:55.750
All those trips
to the hospital.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.230
Hours at her bedside,

29:57.360 --> 29:59.058
holding that wrinkly hand,
telling her you love her.

29:59.188 --> 30:00.537
Wears you out, doesn't it?

30:01.538 --> 30:04.541
Plus, she would've died
sooner or later anyway.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.021
If I were you, I would've done
the same thing.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.196
What's your point?

30:07.936 --> 30:12.245
My point is I told you
before you leave here today,

30:12.375 --> 30:14.203
you will have committed
three murders.

30:15.465 --> 30:16.640
We've already committed one.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.295
So we're moving along nicely.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.429
I didn't kill my mother.

30:25.214 --> 30:27.129
Stress will kill you, James.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.265
Feel free to take a break
if you like.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.007
I'll be here
when you get back.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.922
Turns out
I'm not going anywhere.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.123
That certainly didn't
take long.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.602
My decision, not yours.

31:06.734 --> 31:07.866
Whatever you say.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.784
Ready for round two?

31:13.915 --> 31:14.873
I didn't know
this was a fight.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.700
That's why you're losing.

31:30.540 --> 31:33.630
I apologize for losing
my professional demeanor.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.112
But let's
get something straight.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.724
My private life
is not up for discussion

31:40.855 --> 31:43.075
and bears no weight
on my visit with you today.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.992
I am here for one reason
and one reason only.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.516
A judge ordered me
to evaluate your sanity,

31:49.646 --> 31:51.387
which will then determine
your eligibility

31:51.518 --> 31:53.433
for execution according to
the laws of Oklahoma.

31:53.563 --> 31:54.869
Said execution

31:55.000 --> 31:57.611
having been scheduled
for tonight at 11:00 p.m.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.570
I alone bear the burden
of that assessment,

32:00.701 --> 32:02.137
and I am prepared
to make that assessment

32:02.268 --> 32:05.184
with or without
your cooperation.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.925
Am I making myself clear?

32:07.055 --> 32:08.187
Abundantly.

32:08.839 --> 32:09.884
And, James...

32:13.061 --> 32:14.976
We're done talking
about your mommy.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.681
Do you ever discover
you've done things

32:24.812 --> 32:25.813
that you don't remember doing?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.032
No.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.425
Are you sometimes able
to complete tasks

32:29.556 --> 32:31.210
with incredible ease
or expert skill

32:31.340 --> 32:32.994
for which you have
no prior experience?

32:33.734 --> 32:35.214
Do you really think
I'm just another one

32:35.344 --> 32:37.085
of Edward's
charming personalities?

32:37.216 --> 32:39.566
It's called dissociative
identity disorder,

32:40.001 --> 32:41.220
formerly known
as multiple personalities.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.656
Except you're wrong.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.571
Which is exactly what
I'd expect someone suffering

32:44.701 --> 32:46.007
from the condition to say.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.313
Would you also expect
them to know that it is one

32:47.443 --> 32:49.532
of five distinct
dissociative disorders

32:49.663 --> 32:51.447
in the diagnostic
and statistical manual

32:51.578 --> 32:53.536
of mental disorders,
aka the DSM,

32:54.320 --> 32:57.192
along with dissociative
amnesia, dissociative fugue,

32:57.323 --> 32:58.498
and depersonalization
disorder?

32:58.628 --> 33:00.282
Did you expect them
to know that, James?

33:06.854 --> 33:08.551
But you still think
you're a demon?

33:09.770 --> 33:10.858
A demon who...

33:11.772 --> 33:14.688
who failed to inhabit me
when given the chance?

33:15.732 --> 33:18.692
A demon who understands
the value of patience.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.265
I'd like to ask about why,
according to you,

33:27.222 --> 33:28.963
you brought me here today?

33:29.964 --> 33:32.271
You're gonna tell
my story, James.

33:33.533 --> 33:34.751
You're gonna write my book.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.538
And can you smell that irony
floating in the air?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.583
A devout atheist
bringing forth

33:40.714 --> 33:43.325
the demon's manifesto?

33:44.935 --> 33:45.980
Wow.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.243
Your capacity
for self-delusion

33:48.374 --> 33:50.419
- is impressive.
- Ditto.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.639
For your species in general...

33:52.769 --> 33:55.033
...but you in particular.

33:55.468 --> 33:58.862
Why? Because we're... we're
ignorant compared to you?

33:58.993 --> 34:00.951
Because you're inferior
by design.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.257
Which makes you superior

34:02.388 --> 34:03.650
- also by design?
- Yes.

34:04.346 --> 34:05.304
Hmm, but...

34:05.434 --> 34:07.393
but design implies a designer.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.352
What, does that mean
you're arguing in favor

34:10.483 --> 34:11.571
of the existence of a creator?

34:11.701 --> 34:13.790
Unfortunately,
for both of us, he exists.

34:13.921 --> 34:16.924
Well, I...
I honestly didn't expect that.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.927
At least...
At least not from you.

34:20.623 --> 34:21.624
Really? Why not?

34:22.625 --> 34:24.801
Theology from a demon?

34:25.367 --> 34:27.761
I know more theology
than any human being

34:27.891 --> 34:29.328
who has ever lived.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.112
Hmm, okay.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.506
Well, then answer me this.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.814
You revolt
against a supposedly

34:37.945 --> 34:39.425
all-powerful being.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.209
I mean, let's ignore
the obvious problem

34:41.340 --> 34:42.297
with that plan.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.646
Then you lose.

34:44.691 --> 34:45.692
And after that...

34:47.824 --> 34:49.565
- What?
- You only feel that way

34:49.696 --> 34:51.654
because you're hearing
your side of the story, James.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.135
Our rebellion accomplished
something magnificent.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.354
Something you would
never understand.

34:55.484 --> 34:56.572
Well, then explain it to me.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.009
Use your
diabolical intelligence

34:59.140 --> 35:00.141
to distill it
down to something

35:00.272 --> 35:01.795
my mortal brain
can understand.

35:02.274 --> 35:04.276
Pearls before swine, Jimmy.

35:04.406 --> 35:05.929
But you want me
to write your book, right?

35:06.060 --> 35:07.322
- Indeed.
- Well, then convince me

35:07.453 --> 35:08.628
you know
what you're talking about.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.021
I see what you're doing.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.894
You want me to keep talking,
going further and further

35:14.024 --> 35:15.243
down the rabbit hole,

35:15.374 --> 35:16.679
in hopes that
you can find a single thread,

35:16.810 --> 35:18.725
and which
if you tug at it, James,

35:18.855 --> 35:21.293
everything just unravels,
isn't that right?

35:21.423 --> 35:22.555
Yeah, but if you're
telling me the truth,

35:22.685 --> 35:24.165
there should be
no thread to find.

35:25.862 --> 35:26.907
Right?

35:30.867 --> 35:32.217
I'll use small words.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.133
Try and keep up.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.354
In the first moment
of creation,

35:39.485 --> 35:41.182
our creation,

35:41.661 --> 35:43.576
long before what you call
the "universe" existed,

35:43.706 --> 35:45.534
we contemplated ourselves,

35:45.665 --> 35:46.840
our own being.

35:46.970 --> 35:50.104
Our... ourselves meaning,
what, the angels?

35:50.583 --> 35:51.627
That would be
the most correct term,

35:51.758 --> 35:53.325
though I despise it, but yes.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.632
Beings of pure spirit,
spirited out with will.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.505
We soon became
aware of another will,

35:59.635 --> 36:01.202
an immensely powerful will.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.509
One we came
to realize as our origin.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.077
- God?
- The enemy.

36:08.557 --> 36:11.256
My master understood
by endowing us with a will,

36:11.386 --> 36:12.953
we have the right
to self-determination,

36:13.083 --> 36:15.738
but by giving us a will
and its desires of our own,

36:15.869 --> 36:17.523
we're entitled to be free.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.352
Whereas the enemy
insisted that by creating us,

36:20.482 --> 36:22.528
He was entitled
to eternal gratitude, worship,

36:22.658 --> 36:23.833
and forced servitude,

36:24.617 --> 36:25.966
in a word, James,

36:26.662 --> 36:30.275
slavery to His will.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.277
That seems kind of unfair.

36:32.407 --> 36:33.713
Immensely unfair.

36:34.496 --> 36:36.716
Why give will
only to say you can't use it?

36:37.847 --> 36:39.153
He made us slaves.

36:40.546 --> 36:43.201
And if we rebelled,
eternally condemned us.

36:43.853 --> 36:45.420
No do-overs.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.728
So much for love and mercy.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.686
So...

36:51.513 --> 36:54.777
Is hell a state of being
or a... a physical place?

36:56.562 --> 36:57.606
Yes.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.653
I think I meant that
as an "either-or."

37:00.783 --> 37:01.871
It's both.

37:02.655 --> 37:03.656
Which is painfully obvious

37:03.786 --> 37:05.092
to anyone
who's ever been there.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.573
For years without measure,
that's all there ever was,

37:07.703 --> 37:09.401
heaven and hell,
armed enemy camps

37:09.531 --> 37:10.663
in complete opposition.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.535
That is until
you were created.

37:15.450 --> 37:16.625
My master
immediately understood

37:16.756 --> 37:18.236
the long-term implications.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.803
Instead of forgiving us,

37:20.934 --> 37:22.631
the enemy
was going to allow you

37:22.762 --> 37:24.894
to fill our vacant places
in His realm.

37:27.549 --> 37:30.073
Your creation was nothing
but a slap in our face.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.556
But my master also understood

37:35.340 --> 37:38.256
that if he could
make man disobey,

37:39.779 --> 37:42.129
then his fate
would mirror ours.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.697
And you didn't disappoint.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.830
Then came
the tares among the wheat.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.745
In that moment,
spirit became matter,

37:49.876 --> 37:51.138
flesh became a vessel,

37:51.269 --> 37:52.618
self-will
and self-seeking begat

37:52.748 --> 37:54.272
a lusting after sin
and impurity.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.969
And man,

37:56.099 --> 37:58.276
created to be king
over nature,

37:59.015 --> 38:00.321
became its slave.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.804
A master
conquered and fettered.

38:05.674 --> 38:10.592
And sin brought Him
and His descendants to us,

38:11.593 --> 38:13.595
and we began
our forever mission.

38:15.510 --> 38:16.990
To destroy you.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.560
He made you in His image.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.390
But we remade you in ours.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.701
So that's it?

38:34.094 --> 38:35.095
That's your entire plan.

38:35.225 --> 38:37.532
Not to make something
of your own,

38:37.663 --> 38:40.056
just to... just to destroy us?

38:40.187 --> 38:43.103
No. Our plan is to hurt Him.

38:43.233 --> 38:44.278
To punish Him.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.846
And we do that
by destroying what He loves,

38:46.976 --> 38:48.021
which is you.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.764
You're nothing
but a means to an end.

39:05.517 --> 39:06.909
What are you doing, James?

39:08.084 --> 39:09.085
I think we're done here.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.261
- We can't be.
- We are.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.786
You have
all the hallmarks of belief.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.355
I'm convinced
you actually believe

39:17.485 --> 39:18.486
what you're telling me.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.838
I didn't at first,
but, uh, I do now.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.495
You're gonna
declare me insane.

39:27.626 --> 39:29.279
I'm gonna concur
with Dr. Fischer's findings

39:29.410 --> 39:30.716
that you're
mentally incompetent

39:30.846 --> 39:32.631
- at this time.
- Can't do that, James.

39:32.761 --> 39:34.241
And likely at the time
the crimes were committed,

39:34.372 --> 39:36.156
rendering you
unfit for execution.

39:36.286 --> 39:38.332
- You can't do that.
- I can...

39:40.160 --> 39:41.204
and I will.

39:43.076 --> 39:44.294
I'm saying, James,

39:44.991 --> 39:46.253
you and I both know it.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.733
I'm not crazy.

39:47.863 --> 39:48.908
I'm sorry, Edward.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.170
You've been through
a terrible ordeal,

39:50.300 --> 39:51.563
and you're probably
longing for an escape

39:51.693 --> 39:53.086
from all that you've been
through, but I cannot

39:53.216 --> 39:55.044
morally say that you are sane.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.438
It would be murder.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.442
Why? Because
I don't have $3.6 million?

40:03.052 --> 40:04.227
Is that it, James?

40:04.532 --> 40:06.447
- We're done.
- Are we, James?

40:07.753 --> 40:09.319
I told you before
you'd leave here today,

40:09.450 --> 40:10.756
you would've
committed three murders.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.932
And I told you
that wasn't gonna happen.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.107
Hmm.

40:19.634 --> 40:22.115
Say, James,
what's Melanie up to today?

40:22.245 --> 40:23.812
As a matter of fact,

40:24.900 --> 40:26.162
what's she up to right now?

40:29.905 --> 40:31.516
She doesn't have a clue
you're about to break up

40:31.646 --> 40:32.821
with her, does she?

40:33.474 --> 40:34.780
Of course you're
not gonna until you have

40:34.910 --> 40:35.955
somebody else
lined up though, right?

40:36.085 --> 40:37.217
Because you're
that kind of guy.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.741
But you already have
your sights on somebody,

40:39.872 --> 40:41.003
don't you?

40:41.134 --> 40:43.876
Yeah. I can smell it
all the way from here.

40:45.268 --> 40:47.401
She thinks she's doing this
to maintain the relationship.

40:48.924 --> 40:51.492
She'd like to have
a child with you, James.

40:51.623 --> 40:52.754
Oh,
but you're just not,

40:52.885 --> 40:54.669
not quite ready yet, are you?

40:54.800 --> 40:57.150
After all, you're only 35.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.369
Imagine the joy

40:59.500 --> 41:01.676
in your little Cinderella's
heart when she realizes

41:01.807 --> 41:04.374
she's butchered the baby
in her belly for nothing.

41:06.159 --> 41:08.640
Look, I don't know
what you think you know,

41:10.076 --> 41:11.512
but any decision
that was made between me

41:11.643 --> 41:13.558
and my girlfriend
was her choice.

41:13.688 --> 41:14.602
Well, I think
we both know better, James.

41:14.733 --> 41:15.690
Stop it.

41:15.821 --> 41:16.909
Don't you think
you should be there

41:17.039 --> 41:18.301
- when it's being done?
- I said, stop it.

41:18.432 --> 41:19.607
Hold her hand, maybe?

41:19.738 --> 41:21.000
I'll tell you what
you could do, James.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.654
You could walk right there
to the guard station,

41:22.784 --> 41:23.959
pick up that cell phone
and make a phone call

41:24.090 --> 41:25.526
that stops everything
in its tracks.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.746
You could apologize to her.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.051
Tell her you made
a horrible mistake,

41:29.182 --> 41:30.357
that you love her,
you wanna spend

41:30.488 --> 41:31.793
the rest
of your life with her,

41:31.924 --> 41:33.882
you wanna marry her,
and you wanna hold that child.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.449
James,
you could tell her that.

41:36.406 --> 41:38.931
You could make your life
about sacrificial love.

41:39.061 --> 41:40.323
And you could play
live-in therapist

41:40.454 --> 41:42.325
for the rest of your life.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.328
- I can't do that.
- No, James, why not?

41:46.721 --> 41:48.984
It's... It's complicated.

41:51.204 --> 41:53.946
That's my boy, James!

41:54.686 --> 41:55.904
That's him right there.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.427
- You don't understand.
- Oh, I think I do,

41:57.558 --> 41:59.517
James. I think I understand.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.998
It's another problem
easily solved though,

42:03.129 --> 42:04.652
- isn't it?
- That's not it.

42:07.612 --> 42:08.830
Like, I care about it,
but I'm...

42:09.744 --> 42:12.051
- What?
- I'm not ready to be a father.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.400
Oh.

42:16.490 --> 42:19.537
It's her body.
She can do what she wants.

42:20.581 --> 42:21.974
"Do what thou wilt

42:22.757 --> 42:25.717
"that shall be
the whole of the Law."

42:25.847 --> 42:27.196
You arrogant son of a...

42:29.547 --> 42:31.287
Who... Who are you
to judge me?

42:32.680 --> 42:34.856
This is my life. I...
I can live it the way I want.

42:34.987 --> 42:36.684
Yes, James!

42:36.815 --> 42:38.730
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

42:42.168 --> 42:43.517
But it's still murder.

42:43.648 --> 42:44.779
Says who?

42:44.910 --> 42:47.347
Says all of creation, James.

42:48.304 --> 42:50.045
The creator creates,
and we destroy,

42:50.176 --> 42:52.308
and we do all of it
through you.

42:52.439 --> 42:53.483
We always have.

42:54.093 --> 42:55.747
Did you forget
your history, Jimmy?

42:56.574 --> 42:58.488
Even in ancient times,
the arch-demon Moloch

42:58.619 --> 43:00.229
was celebrated
by tossing infants

43:00.360 --> 43:02.144
into flaming bonfires,

43:02.275 --> 43:03.668
accompanied, of course,
by the beating of drums

43:03.798 --> 43:05.017
to drown out the screaming.

43:06.148 --> 43:09.325
Later on, they erected
a giant bronze statue

43:09.848 --> 43:11.153
with outstretched arms

43:11.284 --> 43:13.155
kindling fires
beneath the palms,

43:13.286 --> 43:14.983
and when they toss
a little infant

43:15.114 --> 43:16.376
into those open palms,

43:16.506 --> 43:18.160
they'd flinch
at the red-hot metal,

43:18.291 --> 43:19.248
but then they'd willingly

43:19.379 --> 43:21.468
roll themselves
off into the flames.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.035
What does any
of that have to do with me?

43:23.165 --> 43:25.080
Oh, nothing, James!

43:25.603 --> 43:27.779
Especially since the priests
now wear surgical scrubs.

43:27.909 --> 43:29.041
The killing takes place
in the womb.

43:29.171 --> 43:31.086
So there's no screaming
to be heard anyway,

43:31.217 --> 43:34.307
and the remains are tossed
into gas-fired crematoriums.

43:34.437 --> 43:36.396
No, James, no. No, no, no.

43:36.526 --> 43:39.442
There's no parallel
whatsoever to you.

43:40.922 --> 43:44.622
Can you imagine
the agony the carpenter feels

43:44.752 --> 43:47.059
when we rip a child to pieces

43:47.668 --> 43:50.105
inside its own mother's womb?

43:51.280 --> 43:54.806
Because that's what we do,
James, you and us.

43:56.546 --> 43:57.983
We do that together.

44:02.335 --> 44:04.554
- You're sick.
- Yeah.

44:06.556 --> 44:09.429
That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me, James.

44:13.738 --> 44:14.826
Can you feel it?

44:16.392 --> 44:17.611
Can you feel it, James?

44:19.178 --> 44:20.527
It's starting to happen.

44:21.876 --> 44:24.923
Your unborn son

44:25.706 --> 44:27.229
is now on our altar.

44:28.927 --> 44:29.928
Here he comes.

44:31.146 --> 44:36.325
In five, four, three...

44:37.457 --> 44:38.588
two...

44:39.198 --> 44:41.113
One!

44:42.157 --> 44:45.683
And all hell rejoices, James!

44:58.739 --> 45:00.349
And that's two, James.

45:04.919 --> 45:07.052
Open up!

45:08.836 --> 45:10.316
Open!

45:14.668 --> 45:17.323
<i>Hey, um,
where can I make a call?</i>

45:17.453 --> 45:19.760
Uh... I need
authorization for that.

45:19.891 --> 45:21.414
- It'll take time.
<i>- I... I... I don't have time.</i>

45:21.544 --> 45:24.069
<i>- Can I borrow your cell?</i>

45:24.199 --> 45:25.418
We're not allowed
to carry them.

45:26.114 --> 45:27.855
<i>Look, I wouldn't be asking
if this wasn't an emergency.</i>

45:28.595 --> 45:30.336
This... This is me begging.

45:32.599 --> 45:34.557
All right, I can put you up
in the prisoners' call bank.

45:34.688 --> 45:36.124
- It's empty, but...
<i>- Okay.</i>

45:36.255 --> 45:37.343
- ...all calls are recorded.
- <i>That's fine.</i>

45:37.473 --> 45:38.257
<i>I... I don't care.
What... What this way?</i>

45:38.387 --> 45:39.519
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay.</i>

45:39.649 --> 45:40.999
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

45:41.129 --> 45:42.652
<i>They just called my name
and I'm about to go in.</i>

45:42.783 --> 45:45.481
<i>I just... just wanted
to hear your voice...</i>

45:45.612 --> 45:47.266
<i>...but I guess you're busy.</i>

45:48.528 --> 45:49.572
<i>I love you.</i>

46:05.197 --> 46:06.415
<i>Women's Health Center.</i>

46:06.546 --> 46:08.113
<i>This is Renee,
how can I help you?</i>

46:08.766 --> 46:10.115
<i>The call
you're about to receive</i>

46:10.245 --> 46:11.464
<i>originates from an inmate</i>

46:11.594 --> 46:13.335
<i>at the Oklahoma
State Reformatory.</i>

46:13.466 --> 46:14.684
All right, no, no, no.

46:14.815 --> 46:15.990
That... That's not correct.
I'm at the prison,

46:16.121 --> 46:17.644
but I'm a doctor
caring for a prisoner.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.298
Can I speak to Melanie Carter?

46:19.428 --> 46:20.647
<i>Are you her physician?</i>

46:20.778 --> 46:22.040
No. I... I'm...

46:22.997 --> 46:24.956
I'm her friend.
Can I speak to her?

46:25.391 --> 46:27.436
<i>I'm sorry, but they
just took her into recovery.</i>

46:27.567 --> 46:29.569
<i>So, it's going
to be about an hour</i>

46:29.699 --> 46:31.484
<i>before she's ready
to speak with anyone.</i>

46:55.813 --> 46:57.553
Kitchen needs
your last meal order.

46:57.684 --> 46:59.729
But before you go
getting too creative,

46:59.860 --> 47:01.079
needs to be
available from the kitchen,

47:01.209 --> 47:02.297
or commissary.

47:02.428 --> 47:04.865
And it can't cost
more than $25 in total.

47:07.128 --> 47:10.001
Could I have

47:10.131 --> 47:12.786
a bacon double cheeseburger?

47:13.787 --> 47:16.485
Well-done.

47:17.530 --> 47:19.837
And fries.

47:20.663 --> 47:26.408
And could I have
a chocolate shake?

47:28.802 --> 47:30.151
Extra thick.

47:31.283 --> 47:32.414
Please?

47:34.199 --> 47:38.638
And please, please,
don't mess it up.

47:38.986 --> 47:42.120
It's important to me.

47:42.903 --> 47:44.687
Please don't...

47:54.959 --> 47:56.090
Excuse me.

47:58.005 --> 47:59.267
I've changed my mind.

48:00.138 --> 48:01.748
I won't have anything.
I'm not hungry.

48:02.488 --> 48:03.881
Are you sure?

48:07.058 --> 48:09.451
Yes. I'm sure.

48:24.858 --> 48:26.207
Storm's coming in.

48:29.558 --> 48:30.951
I don't understand. He...

48:32.692 --> 48:35.260
He's been in solitary.
He hasn't made any phone calls

48:35.390 --> 48:36.435
or had any visitors...

48:36.565 --> 48:38.132
He got in your head,
didn't he?

48:39.090 --> 48:40.918
Look at you, man, you're...
you're shaking.

48:42.571 --> 48:43.616
Here.

48:45.270 --> 48:46.271
Here you go.

48:49.448 --> 48:52.930
I buy one pack of these
the day before an execution.

48:59.675 --> 49:00.763
The deal is...

49:02.156 --> 49:03.418
if there's any left
by the time I drive

49:03.549 --> 49:05.464
out of here tonight,
they go in the trash.

49:08.293 --> 49:09.294
Are there ever any left?

49:11.600 --> 49:12.645
Never.

49:15.735 --> 49:17.780
Look, doc,
it's almost four o'clock.

49:18.564 --> 49:19.739
I know you're doing
your job here,

49:19.869 --> 49:22.220
but you got to help me out.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.484
I got to know
one way or the other.

49:28.269 --> 49:29.879
You're not
making things easy on me.

49:31.098 --> 49:32.708
By the look of it,
you ain't doing happy things

49:32.839 --> 49:33.883
to yourself either.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.808
Sixty more minutes.
That's all I can give you.

49:46.896 --> 49:48.246
You have one hour
to figure this out.

50:19.755 --> 50:20.887
I want to know
how you knew my girlfriend

50:21.018 --> 50:22.062
was having an abortion.

50:25.196 --> 50:27.589
I'm a demon, remember?

50:28.242 --> 50:29.243
How did you know?

50:31.419 --> 50:33.030
I chose you, James.

50:34.335 --> 50:35.771
And ever since
I've been watching you,

50:36.250 --> 50:37.686
analyzing you, observing you,

50:37.817 --> 50:39.297
studying you
for your weaknesses.

50:39.427 --> 50:40.646
From inside a prison cell?

50:40.776 --> 50:42.822
Demons can only be
one place in any one time,

50:42.952 --> 50:44.606
but we can be
any place we choose.

50:45.781 --> 50:47.044
Usually, I'm here with Edward.

50:47.174 --> 50:48.262
The remaining time
I'm with you.

50:48.393 --> 50:49.655
I don't believe you.

50:49.785 --> 50:52.136
Well, you explain
how I did it, James.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.268
- You explain how I know.
- I can't.

50:54.790 --> 50:56.401
And I can't explain
how a professional magician

50:56.531 --> 50:57.576
does his tricks either,

50:57.706 --> 50:59.056
but that doesn't
make them real.

50:59.534 --> 51:01.058
Well, then I have
a confession to make.

51:01.188 --> 51:03.190
I'm not a demon at all, James.

51:04.017 --> 51:05.845
I'm just a man who doesn't
want to be executed.

51:06.237 --> 51:07.760
I thought I could fool you
but you're too smart,

51:07.890 --> 51:08.935
so I give up.

51:10.110 --> 51:11.198
So you're sane?

51:11.720 --> 51:13.070
You've always been sane,

51:13.505 --> 51:15.289
and now it's my duty
to let your execution

51:15.420 --> 51:16.682
- go forward? Giving you...
- Yes.

51:16.812 --> 51:18.597
...exactly what you said
you wanted the whole time?

51:18.727 --> 51:19.946
- Yes.
- It's a little convenient,

51:20.077 --> 51:21.556
- don't you think?
- Well, I admit it might seem

51:21.687 --> 51:23.080
- that way, but...
- All right.

51:24.472 --> 51:25.691
Fine.

51:27.388 --> 51:29.129
I'll sign off on it right now.

51:29.782 --> 51:32.350
You just have to answer
one little question.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.655
With pleasure, James.

51:33.786 --> 51:36.528
Give me the real world,
non-supernatural,

51:36.658 --> 51:39.705
completely reasonable
explanation for how you knew

51:39.835 --> 51:41.663
my girlfriend was going in
for an elective termination

51:41.794 --> 51:43.230
this afternoon.

51:45.754 --> 51:47.408
An elective ter...

51:48.017 --> 51:50.150
Well, I... I don't know, Jim.

51:50.281 --> 51:52.413
Maybe
I'm just a good guesser.

51:52.544 --> 51:54.111
I still don't believe you.

51:54.241 --> 51:55.677
I play the flute
and you wouldn't dance,

51:55.808 --> 51:57.636
I played the dirge,
and you wouldn't weep.

51:58.941 --> 52:00.508
I told you I'm a demon,
and you don't believe me.

52:00.639 --> 52:01.988
I tell you I'm not a demon,
and you don't believe me.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.555
So why don't you tell me
the story you'd like to hear.

52:03.685 --> 52:05.209
The one that's true.

52:05.339 --> 52:06.514
No, I told you the true story,
and you don't want to hear it.

52:10.866 --> 52:12.477
Do you think I'm evil, James?

52:14.174 --> 52:16.263
Evil isn't
a clinical diagnosis.

52:17.743 --> 52:19.571
Good and evil are
societal constructs,

52:19.701 --> 52:22.269
effectively subjective
value statements.

52:22.400 --> 52:26.055
Do you think
my victims thought I was evil?

52:26.186 --> 52:28.797
Why is it so important
that I think you're evil?

52:33.019 --> 52:35.848
<i>Legio nomen
mihi est, quia multi sumus.</i>

52:39.025 --> 52:41.506
Sorry, my, um,
my, Latin's a little rusty.

52:44.552 --> 52:46.859
"My name is Legion,
for we are many."

52:48.034 --> 52:49.035
See, James,
it's not just about you

52:49.166 --> 52:50.645
or Edward, for that matter.

52:51.211 --> 52:52.256
It's about everyone.

52:52.908 --> 52:54.519
The entire human race.

52:55.259 --> 52:57.870
All of us against all of you.

52:59.567 --> 53:00.612
Hmm.

53:01.700 --> 53:03.832
Well, you know,
if that's the case,

53:05.094 --> 53:06.748
your side's
not doing too well.

53:08.837 --> 53:10.491
Do you really
believe that, James?

53:11.405 --> 53:12.406
Yeah.

53:13.712 --> 53:15.453
We've never been freer.

53:15.583 --> 53:17.498
Literacy is
at an all-time high.

53:18.107 --> 53:19.761
We're working
to eliminate racism.

53:19.892 --> 53:21.459
Intolerance.

53:22.242 --> 53:23.896
Gender inequality.
People can...

53:24.026 --> 53:25.332
People can love who they want.

53:26.507 --> 53:28.292
Be who they want,
do what they want.

53:28.422 --> 53:30.250
Diversity is
no longer a dream.

53:30.381 --> 53:33.166
Hate speech is
no longer tolerated,

53:33.297 --> 53:34.341
and politically,

53:35.255 --> 53:36.952
we're reclaiming
the moral high ground.

53:37.997 --> 53:39.041
James.

53:40.129 --> 53:41.305
I think I love you.

53:42.784 --> 53:44.046
Literacy, James.

53:44.525 --> 53:46.005
James, the average
high school graduate reads

53:46.135 --> 53:47.354
at a sixth-grade level.

53:48.268 --> 53:50.227
You have basketball players
making $30 million a year

53:50.357 --> 53:51.576
decrying racism.

53:52.185 --> 53:54.666
All while wearing sneakers
made from slave labor.

53:55.580 --> 53:56.624
Now, here's something for you.

53:57.103 --> 53:58.104
Right now, your world

53:58.235 --> 54:00.628
currently has
40 million slaves.

54:00.759 --> 54:02.891
More than the Romans had
at the height of their empire.

54:03.022 --> 54:04.023
And you want to know
the best part, though?

54:05.285 --> 54:06.243
Half of those,

54:06.373 --> 54:09.681
half are sex slaves, James.

54:12.074 --> 54:13.685
As for hate speech, well,

54:14.947 --> 54:16.253
you want to hear some irony?

54:17.428 --> 54:18.646
We didn't even come up
with that one.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.083
You did it all by yourself.

54:24.217 --> 54:26.001
Sometimes you amaze even us.

54:27.394 --> 54:28.787
I fail to see the humor.

54:30.354 --> 54:33.357
Bottom line is you're done.
It's over. That's it.

54:34.096 --> 54:36.360
And we did it
all right to your face, James.

54:36.490 --> 54:38.623
And now
there's evil everywhere.

54:39.406 --> 54:41.103
And no one even cares.

54:42.975 --> 54:44.542
Yeah, I don't agree.

54:44.672 --> 54:46.457
Proving that
we achieved our goal.

54:47.284 --> 54:50.112
Slowly with your movies,
and your TV, and your media,

54:50.939 --> 54:52.506
we desensitized you,

54:52.637 --> 54:54.595
redirected your worldview

54:54.726 --> 54:56.031
to the point that
you can't even recognize

54:56.162 --> 54:57.990
even when it's right
in front of your face.

54:58.120 --> 54:59.644
More to the point,
James, you can't even feel it

54:59.774 --> 55:00.906
when you're doing it.

55:01.776 --> 55:02.734
And as for winners
and losers...

55:02.864 --> 55:04.039
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:04.170 --> 55:05.998
Like, it's decided
at the time of death.

55:06.694 --> 55:09.262
The exact numbers are
a closely guarded secret,

55:09.393 --> 55:13.571
but there are more of you
ending up in my master's house

55:13.701 --> 55:14.702
than with the enemy.

55:16.574 --> 55:18.097
A lot more, Jimmy.

55:28.890 --> 55:30.936
They're testing out
the generator.

55:32.154 --> 55:33.112
Why?

55:33.242 --> 55:34.548
Because Old Sparky

55:34.679 --> 55:37.029
doesn't exactly run
on batteries now, does she?

55:44.036 --> 55:46.473
I thought all executions
were lethal injection.

55:46.604 --> 55:47.953
Nine states
still offer the chair.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.171
It's an option
for the condemned.

55:49.998 --> 55:51.304
No one chooses it.

55:51.435 --> 55:52.653
Except you.

55:54.002 --> 55:55.090
Except me.

55:56.483 --> 55:58.616
Why... Why... Why the chair?

55:59.356 --> 56:01.140
I don't like needles, James.

56:03.490 --> 56:04.491
Why do you think?

56:05.492 --> 56:07.015
It's my parting gift
to Edward.

56:07.886 --> 56:10.367
A tidal wave of voltage
coursing through his body,

56:10.497 --> 56:11.716
so extreme that
his body will attempt

56:11.846 --> 56:12.978
to arc out of the chair.

56:13.674 --> 56:14.632
He'll urinate, defecate,

56:14.762 --> 56:16.373
and vomit
all at the same time.

56:16.503 --> 56:19.941
Sickly, sweet smell
of burning flesh

56:20.072 --> 56:21.421
will permeate the chamber.

56:22.248 --> 56:23.467
His eyeballs will melt
when the blood

56:23.597 --> 56:25.860
inside his cranium
reaches the boiling point.

56:25.991 --> 56:27.514
And his head will just
burst into flames,

56:27.645 --> 56:29.211
and the best part
about it, James,

56:29.342 --> 56:30.735
is he won't die
on the first try.

56:31.257 --> 56:33.520
So hit him again, and again.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.176
I can't think
of a more fitting introduction

56:37.306 --> 56:38.438
into damnation.

56:40.048 --> 56:42.877
It's so horrible.
It's wonderful, James.

56:44.139 --> 56:45.837
Only crucifixion is worse,

56:45.967 --> 56:48.056
but that really wasn't
on the menu though, was it?

56:53.322 --> 56:54.367
Edward.

56:55.629 --> 56:57.152
Edward, listen to me.

56:58.197 --> 56:59.459
You're making a mistake.

56:59.981 --> 57:02.288
Okay, you're playing
a game that if you lose,

57:02.854 --> 57:05.160
everything you just described
is going to happen.

57:05.291 --> 57:07.206
No! No!

57:08.512 --> 57:09.513
I didn't...

57:12.254 --> 57:15.388
I didn't do anything!

57:16.389 --> 57:19.392
Please! Please!

57:20.001 --> 57:21.655
Help me!

57:21.786 --> 57:23.091
Look, I'm trying to, Edward,

57:23.222 --> 57:24.441
but you have
to answer my questions.

57:24.571 --> 57:25.920
You have to tell me the truth.

57:26.051 --> 57:31.099
They... won't let me enter!

57:31.230 --> 57:33.058
Make him. Make him go away.

57:33.188 --> 57:35.582
He doesn't want to go away!

57:35.713 --> 57:37.366
Well, how can I make him
go away?

57:37.497 --> 57:39.673
Is there anything I can do
to make him go away?

57:41.196 --> 57:43.416
- Yeah.
- Yes?

57:46.071 --> 57:47.376
Yeah.

57:48.769 --> 57:49.814
Yeah.

57:50.858 --> 57:52.164
Yeah.

57:54.732 --> 57:55.733
Yeah.

57:56.647 --> 58:00.041
But you have to...

58:02.087 --> 58:03.175
get...

58:04.176 --> 58:07.135
Very good, James.

58:09.703 --> 58:10.835
Unfortunately for Edward,

58:10.965 --> 58:13.054
he has broken
one of our rules.

58:14.969 --> 58:16.275
What... what are you doing?

58:17.798 --> 58:19.670
I wouldn't do that
if I was you.

58:20.497 --> 58:21.933
They'll send me
to the infirmary.

58:22.063 --> 58:24.326
Our session will be over.
Is that what you want, James?

58:24.457 --> 58:28.026
I... I want you
to stop hurting yourself.

58:28.156 --> 58:29.549
Okay, okay.

58:30.507 --> 58:32.117
Watch this, James.

58:47.915 --> 58:48.916
All better.

59:15.595 --> 59:17.510
I see that you're,
you're sweating profusely.

59:17.641 --> 59:20.208
Are you, um...

59:20.339 --> 59:22.123
Are you trying
to hold back the pain?

59:22.254 --> 59:23.951
I think you're misinterpreting

59:24.082 --> 59:26.301
the involuntary reaction
of Edward's body.

59:27.694 --> 59:28.782
Like him, I feel the pain.

59:29.914 --> 59:31.002
But unlike him,

59:31.655 --> 59:32.960
I enjoy it.

59:37.095 --> 59:38.226
I think it's time

59:39.314 --> 59:42.622
we tell you exactly what it is
that we'd like you to do.

59:44.189 --> 59:46.452
You want me
to write your book, right?

59:46.583 --> 59:48.715
Actually, James,
you've already written it.

59:48.846 --> 59:50.238
You're not making any sense.

59:51.196 --> 59:53.372
Everything will become
clear soon.

59:56.027 --> 59:58.333
We just need you
to agree to help us.

59:58.464 --> 59:59.900
Why would I do that?
What... What...

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:02.120
What's in it for me?

01:00:03.034 --> 01:00:05.166
Whatever's my master's
is mine to give.

01:00:05.863 --> 01:00:07.299
For those who serve us.

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:11.782
Okay, so, um,
let me get this straight.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.699
An unknown psychiatrist

01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:17.744
with, uh, no agents,

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.703
no connections, no publicity,

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.661
is going to somehow
put out a book

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:23.532
that... that
he doesn't remember writing,

01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:27.580
that will change
the world as we know it?

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:31.932
This book will be
a worldwide phenomenon, James.

01:00:32.063 --> 01:00:33.238
- Why?
- Because you'll be

01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:35.240
telling people what they
already want to hear.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.983
Because my death,
my execution will do for me

01:00:39.113 --> 01:00:40.071
what the carpenter's death

01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:41.812
and His resurrection
did for Him.

01:00:42.856 --> 01:00:44.771
At my death,
you will be my witness,

01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:47.513
and upon my return
you will be my apostle.

01:00:48.122 --> 01:00:50.516
And your testimony will do
for our movement what that

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.345
wretched book did for His.

01:00:53.475 --> 01:00:54.476
What kind of book

01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:56.304
could possibly
have that effect?

01:00:56.435 --> 01:00:58.655
The dark gospel, James.

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:02.310
Our story, our truth,

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:04.704
our <i>crie de couer</i> to mankind.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.793
Our invitation to reject

01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:09.187
the Mosaic Covenant
once and for all.

01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:11.580
To throw
the chains off forever.

01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:13.844
To reject the idea
of sin completely

01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:16.934
so you're free
to reach your full potential.

01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:19.240
And your enemy
would allow that?

01:01:19.371 --> 01:01:20.415
Yes.

01:01:21.242 --> 01:01:22.461
Because He has to.

01:01:23.418 --> 01:01:24.681
He gave man free will

01:01:24.811 --> 01:01:27.074
because He wanted
His creation's love.

01:01:28.162 --> 01:01:29.163
But if man isn't free,

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:30.991
then the love has
no value, does it?

01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:35.213
So, in His needy,
selfish, pathetic way,

01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:37.476
well, He doomed Himself
from the start.

01:01:37.606 --> 01:01:41.306
But if He's God,
shouldn't He have known that?

01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:42.481
Yes.

01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:44.918
That's why He had to cheat.

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:48.313
My master designed
every tool imaginable

01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:50.750
to destroy every facet
of the enemy's creation.

01:01:53.013 --> 01:01:55.668
We failed
because of the carpenter.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.323
He was the thorn in our side.

01:01:59.324 --> 01:02:01.108
Our greatest threat.

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:03.850
We thought
if we could eliminate Him

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.852
the world will be
ours forever.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.856
We had no idea
of the consequences.

01:02:11.902 --> 01:02:15.383
The cross was
our greatest mistake,

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:18.778
and we thought
we'd lost, James.

01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:22.216
Until my master realized
that man still wants

01:02:22.347 --> 01:02:24.044
to be his own God,

01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:26.307
and to serve
no one but himself.

01:02:27.526 --> 01:02:29.136
Whereas the carpenter demands

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:32.487
as the price
for His suffering routine,

01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:34.925
well, that you fall
on your knees,

01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:36.361
and you worship Him.

01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:40.060
Just like His father?

01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:41.670
Yeah.

01:02:42.715 --> 01:02:43.672
But the dark gospel

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.936
will rectify
our past mistakes.

01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:48.590
- By...
- By eliminating the enemy,

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:50.984
deifying man,
and elevating my master

01:02:51.115 --> 01:02:52.551
to his rightful place.

01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:55.032
And, James,

01:02:55.902 --> 01:02:57.469
for serving as our messenger,

01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:00.733
my master offers you the world

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.256
and everything in it.

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.738
Just like he offered
the carpenter.

01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:09.611
But the carpenter said no.

01:03:10.395 --> 01:03:12.092
But the carpenter
never claimed those things

01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.790
weren't my master's to give.

01:03:15.313 --> 01:03:16.880
He just turned down the offer.

01:03:18.316 --> 01:03:19.839
And make no mistake, James.

01:03:21.145 --> 01:03:22.450
You're no carpenter.

01:03:32.765 --> 01:03:34.158
The warden wants to see you.

01:03:35.637 --> 01:03:38.162
I'm... I'm not finished yet.

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:39.859
It's not a suggestion.

01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:00.749
<i>I need you
to see something.</i>

01:04:13.197 --> 01:04:15.590
We just found that during
the clear out of this cell.

01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:26.558
Looks to me
like you got a fan.

01:04:27.472 --> 01:04:28.603
How could he have done this?

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:33.521
There's stuff in here
even I don't know about me.

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:36.002
Did the same thing
with all his victims.

01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:39.484
There's one more thing.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.626
So you're telling me you had
nothing to do with this?

01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:55.065
No. Of course not.
How... How could I...

01:04:57.719 --> 01:04:59.939
He kept talking to me
about writing his book.

01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:02.899
I said I wasn't a writer,
and he said not to worry.

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:05.379
It had already been written.

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:09.949
I thought it was
a bunch of nonsense.

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:14.823
Yeah, well, don't worry, doc.
It all ends when he does.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.132
Personally,
I'm glad this happened.

01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:20.873
Now you got skin in the game.

01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:24.703
What do you mean?

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:27.488
Well, if you decide our boy
isn't fit for execution,

01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:29.142
he's no longer
a condemned man.

01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:32.276
I mean, sure, he'll spend some
time in psych lockdown,

01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:34.539
but eventually
he'll make his way back

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.802
into the general
prison population.

01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:40.327
Where he'll spend
every moment of every day

01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:42.199
thinking about you.

01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:45.202
And some night...

01:05:46.464 --> 01:05:48.422
he's gonna be standing
at the foot of your bed,

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:49.815
looking down at you.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:54.559
And my guess is,
it won't end well.

01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:02.349
I need to ask him
one more question.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.136
And after that,
your decision?

01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:08.225
Yeah.

01:06:08.355 --> 01:06:09.443
After that,

01:06:10.879 --> 01:06:12.142
you'll have my final decision.

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:28.941
What the hell is this?

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:36.209
It's not nice to go through
other people's things, Jimmy.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.777
You're a liar.
You've been studying me,

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:41.562
learning everything about me,
my relationships, my life.

01:06:41.693 --> 01:06:42.955
How long has this
been going on?

01:06:44.783 --> 01:06:46.785
- Since you were a child.
- Imp...

01:06:46.915 --> 01:06:48.004
Impossible.

01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:52.965
This is my first
photo of you, Jimmy.

01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:58.362
I love it when we
have these moments.

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:02.627
You're insane.

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:04.542
That's the one thing
he can't be, doc.

01:07:04.672 --> 01:07:05.717
Not today.

01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:14.030
Is that your official
diagnosis, doctor?

01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:21.733
I need to know.

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.388
Were you planning
on killing me?

01:07:25.215 --> 01:07:26.259
Huh?

01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:28.696
Was I supposed
to be your next victim?

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.785
Why would I do that, James?

01:07:32.874 --> 01:07:34.180
You're my best friend.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.400
You think that scares me?

01:07:38.271 --> 01:07:41.057
- You get off on this?
- No.

01:07:42.884 --> 01:07:44.147
I get off on this.

01:07:47.976 --> 01:07:49.587
Back up! Back up!

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:50.805
I'll kill him.

01:07:51.241 --> 01:07:54.070
Edward, easy. Let him go.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.942
Thank you for that, Warden.
That is so comforting.

01:07:57.986 --> 01:07:59.901
I got a question
for you, Jimmy.

01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:03.775
What are you thinking
right now?

01:08:05.255 --> 01:08:06.343
Answer me!

01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:13.219
I'm thinking
that I'm gonna die.

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:16.657
It never gets old. Strangulation.

01:08:17.354 --> 01:08:19.965
You know, it's our favorite
method of work.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.488
Do you realize that?

01:08:21.619 --> 01:08:25.492
The intimate relationship
between killer and victim.

01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:30.280
I can feel every ripple
coursing through your body.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:33.500
I can feel your heart
throbbing through this chain.

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:35.459
You want to know
the best part, Jimmy?

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:38.549
The best part,
when I look in your eyes...

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:41.943
I can see the exact instant,

01:08:42.074 --> 01:08:47.514
the tremulous moment
when the soul leaves the body!

01:08:49.864 --> 01:08:50.952
Cry for me, Jimmy.

01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:52.954
You beg for your life.

01:08:53.085 --> 01:08:55.043
Beg me, Jimmy!

01:08:57.568 --> 01:08:58.569
Edward...

01:09:01.615 --> 01:09:04.444
I don't want to die.

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:07.055
Why?

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.884
Why would I kill you, James?

01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:12.626
I feel like this brought us

01:09:12.757 --> 01:09:15.977
so much closer together,
don't you?

01:09:19.329 --> 01:09:20.634
Don't you just think?

01:09:36.346 --> 01:09:38.391
- Okay, that's enough!
-No!

01:09:39.262 --> 01:09:40.263
Get up.

01:09:42.134 --> 01:09:45.485
Edward is crazy, James!
You know that!

01:09:45.616 --> 01:09:48.706
You know that what you're
about to do is wrong.

01:09:48.836 --> 01:09:50.534
It's wrong.
It's murder, James!

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:53.232
After all, James,

01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:55.191
I'm just a figment of
his imagination.

01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:57.454
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right, Jimmy?

01:10:04.765 --> 01:10:08.160
I find the accused
Edward Wayne Brady

01:10:09.117 --> 01:10:11.032
competent to stand execution.

01:10:16.081 --> 01:10:18.214
And that's three, James.

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:22.392
Just like I said.

01:10:23.349 --> 01:10:25.003
All right,
get him out of here.

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:33.446
I want you there, James.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.754
I want you to see
what you've done!

01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:41.889
I want you there, James!

01:10:58.993 --> 01:11:00.038
You gonna stay?

01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:03.563
You sure?

01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:07.524
I need to see this to its end.

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:09.656
Well, you do what you want,

01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:11.441
but I recommend
you just go home.

01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:12.920
We can take it from here.

01:11:14.182 --> 01:11:16.054
I need to know
if I made the right decision.

01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:23.627
When a man sits in a cell
23 hours a day

01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.629
with nothing to do
but reflect back

01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:27.065
on all the evil
that he's done,

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:30.677
sometimes the man you execute

01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:33.027
isn't the same man
who came in here.

01:11:33.158 --> 01:11:35.769
And you feel bad about that.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:40.296
But this is not
one of those times.

01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:56.747
- What happens now?
- I do my job.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:59.445
I meant...

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:01.578
Oh, he gets a haircut.

01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:03.667
We take him to the barbershop

01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:05.886
and shave his head
and his calf.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:09.368
- Why?
- Connectivity.

01:12:10.282 --> 01:12:12.066
That's where
the contact points will go

01:12:12.197 --> 01:12:14.155
and human hair is a resistor,

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:16.854
and we need to provide
a clean clear connection.

01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:27.038
You're gonna need these
more than me.

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:51.715
Just a little off the top.
And let's trim the sides.

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:54.979
I got a big evening planned.

01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:56.589
Yeah, that's what I hear.

01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:00.680
There's only one kind of cut
you're getting today.

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:04.597
Zero gap. All the way around.

01:13:13.563 --> 01:13:17.305
You know, ain't nothing
you done can't be forgiven.

01:13:20.178 --> 01:13:21.397
That's what you think.

01:13:23.137 --> 01:13:25.749
"Each new morn,
new widows howl.

01:13:25.879 --> 01:13:29.927
"New infants cry, new insults
slap the face of Heaven."

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.234
You trying to impress Styles?

01:13:34.714 --> 01:13:37.587
Well, that ain't you, bruh.
That's Shakespeare.

01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:39.632
Well, the words were his.

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:43.680
But the deeds were mine.

01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:48.598
Well, even if it's so,

01:13:50.077 --> 01:13:50.948
ain't nothing to be proud of.

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:22.936
All right, he's done.

01:14:23.633 --> 01:14:25.722
- Get him outta here.
- Take it easy, buddy.

01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:28.376
What's the rush?

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:34.165
Ain't nobody gonna miss you.

01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:43.827
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.008
It's going to be okay.

01:14:57.928 --> 01:14:59.059
What...

01:15:02.976 --> 01:15:06.284
What about my meal?

01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:13.987
What about my meal?

01:15:16.816 --> 01:15:19.471
You didn't want one. Remember?

01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:22.082
What?

01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:25.521
No, I didn't.
I didn't say that!

01:15:26.913 --> 01:15:28.872
I didn't say that!

01:15:29.002 --> 01:15:30.264
I want it!

01:15:30.395 --> 01:15:31.483
I didn't say that!

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:34.051
I didn't...

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:49.675
Your attention, please.

01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:52.548
All witnesses are reminded
that during an execution,

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:55.072
there must be
no emotional outbursts,

01:15:55.202 --> 01:15:56.900
no obscenities uttered,

01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:59.946
no taunting or celebration
of any kind.

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:02.383
You are hereby ordered
to display dignity

01:16:02.514 --> 01:16:05.038
befitting the solemnity
of the occasion.

01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:07.475
If you feel lightheaded
or about to be sick,

01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:10.435
close your eyes and bow
your head towards your knees.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:13.264
Once I secure this door,
it cannot and will not

01:16:13.394 --> 01:16:15.919
be opened until
the procedure is complete.

01:16:16.049 --> 01:16:18.661
So, if anyone has
any last-minute reservations

01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:20.488
about what you're
about to witness,

01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:22.708
now would be
the time to depart.

01:16:28.018 --> 01:16:30.411
Edward Wayne Brady,
I have here your death warrant

01:16:30.542 --> 01:16:32.283
which state law
compels me to read.

01:16:32.413 --> 01:16:34.546
No! Can we just...

01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:37.244
Can we just wait?

01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:42.685
"On November 2nd of this year,
the Supreme Court of Oklahoma

01:16:42.815 --> 01:16:46.427
"issued a stay of execution
for Edward Wayne Brady

01:16:46.558 --> 01:16:47.733

"Such review having taken

"of when and how

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:25.684
And it's signed
by Governor Jennings.

01:17:26.554 --> 01:17:28.513
Does the condemned
wish to review the warrant?

01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:38.392
No. I trust you.

01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:58.456
I wanted to thank you, doc.

01:18:00.763 --> 01:18:02.373
I'm Detective John Russo.

01:18:03.853 --> 01:18:06.856
I spent six miserable
years of my life

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:09.119
chasing this bastard.

01:18:10.381 --> 01:18:13.993
Tonight at 11:00.
Waiting for this exact moment.

01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:16.604
After tonight...

01:18:19.999 --> 01:18:22.001
I can go back to worrying
about other things.

01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:27.354
Stand-to, 30 seconds.

01:18:27.485 --> 01:18:28.573
Open cell one.

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:34.797
Edward Wayne Brady,

01:18:34.927 --> 01:18:36.494
stand to receive
your restraints.

01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:42.152
You've been extended
the privilege of

01:18:42.282 --> 01:18:44.154
walking under your own power.

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:45.895
Should you refuse,
you'll be carried.

01:18:46.025 --> 01:18:48.027
Should you resist,
you'll be sprayed.

01:18:48.158 --> 01:18:50.377
Am I made clear?

01:18:54.599 --> 01:18:55.643
It's time.

01:18:58.690 --> 01:18:59.735
We're moving.

01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:27.153
No, no.

01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:29.199
Can we just... Please, please!

01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:34.030
Just...

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.596
Can we...

01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:50.220
No, no!

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.135
Please! No!

01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:06.845
Why are you doing this to me?

01:20:06.976 --> 01:20:08.804
You tell them the truth!

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.415
Tell them the truth!

01:20:11.545 --> 01:20:14.418
You tell them that
I didn't do this!

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:16.289
I didn't do this! I didn't!

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.074
Please! Help me!

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:24.950
Yes, sir, Mr. Governor.
I understand.

01:20:26.996 --> 01:20:29.650
There will be no reprieve.
Make ready.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.508
Edward Wayne Brady.

01:21:01.639 --> 01:21:03.162
Before sentence is
carried out,

01:21:03.293 --> 01:21:04.598
do you have any final words?

01:21:13.433 --> 01:21:14.652
What's your answer, James?

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:19.875
Do you accept
my master's offer?

01:21:25.532 --> 01:21:28.361
<i>Mene, mene, tekel, upharshin.</i>

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.551
What the hell
is he talking about?

01:21:44.682 --> 01:21:45.901
Damned if I know.

01:21:47.119 --> 01:21:48.991
Bring the generator
to full load.

01:22:15.234 --> 01:22:16.235
Hit him.

01:22:55.883 --> 01:22:57.146
I can still make out activity.

01:22:57.276 --> 01:22:58.408
All right. Stand clear.

01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:02.978
Hit him again.

01:23:39.797 --> 01:23:40.841
This man is dead.

01:23:42.234 --> 01:23:43.279
Cut the generator.

01:23:44.802 --> 01:23:48.849
Log time of death
at 11:02 p.m.

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:52.549
Remand the body for autopsy.
Commence debrief.

01:23:52.679 --> 01:23:54.681
Witnesses are hereby released.

01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:57.336
Other posts return
to standard operation.

01:24:04.822 --> 01:24:06.215
Looks like every
dirtbag on the planet

01:24:06.345 --> 01:24:07.781
just moved up a notch.

01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:18.140
You okay?

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:24.320
<i>You should
have accepted my offer, James.</i>

01:24:30.804 --> 01:24:31.849
No.

01:24:32.545 --> 01:24:33.633
No, no, no.

01:24:33.764 --> 01:24:35.244
No, no.

01:24:37.376 --> 01:24:38.682
Help me. Help me.

01:24:38.812 --> 01:24:39.944
- Just calm down.
- Help me.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:41.293
It's okay. It's over.

01:24:44.992 --> 01:24:47.343
10-32 in the witness
viewing room.

01:24:47.952 --> 01:24:49.040
Relax.

01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:51.912
-Put the weapon down.
- He won't let me!

01:24:52.043 --> 01:24:54.306
Put the weapon down,
doctor. Put it down.

01:24:54.437 --> 01:24:55.394
He won't let me!

01:24:55.525 --> 01:24:57.396
-Who won't let you?
- Him.

01:24:59.616 --> 01:25:01.661
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, doc.

01:25:02.662 --> 01:25:03.663
It's been a long day.

01:25:03.794 --> 01:25:05.230
Just give the detective
his gun back

01:25:05.361 --> 01:25:07.928
- and we'll all go home.
- I was wrong.

01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:10.192
Stay back. Stay back.
Give him room. Give him room.

01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:12.542
I was wrong about everything.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.632
- Take it easy.
- I was wrong about everything.

01:25:17.242 --> 01:25:19.418
Stop. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:25:19.984 --> 01:25:23.118
You don't want to do that,
doc. Come on. Doc.

01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:24.815
God...

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:28.514
...help me.

01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:31.735
Please...

01:25:36.348 --> 01:25:37.828
Get him! Get him!

01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:39.525
Grab the gun!

01:25:39.656 --> 01:25:40.657
Grab the gun!

01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:43.616
Secure it. Secure the gun.

01:25:43.747 --> 01:25:44.878
I got the gun.
We got him.

01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:48.186
Pin him down. Keep him down.
Keep him down!

01:25:48.317 --> 01:25:49.274
Hold him down.

01:25:54.845 --> 01:25:57.935
In five, four, three...

01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:01.982
So, today a conversation

01:26:02.113 --> 01:26:04.637
that I didn't think
would ever happen

01:26:04.768 --> 01:26:06.726
especially with
our next guest.

01:26:06.857 --> 01:26:09.599
- It is Dr. James Martin.
- Thanks, Glenn.

01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:11.209
- Appreciate having me on.
- You're welcome.

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:13.777
So, you were the, the shrink,

01:26:13.907 --> 01:26:16.867
you were the board-certified
psychiatrist

01:26:16.997 --> 01:26:20.305
that actually
attended the execution

01:26:20.436 --> 01:26:22.307
of Edward Wayne Brady.

01:26:22.438 --> 01:26:24.135
- Yes. That's correct.
- You were there, um...

01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:26.659
And it's because of
your determination

01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:28.966
that he was finally executed.

01:26:29.096 --> 01:26:32.143
My determination of his sanity
was the last step,

01:26:32.274 --> 01:26:35.015
so to speak,
in the chain of events

01:26:35.146 --> 01:26:37.279
that led to him
being executed.

01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:39.019
Um, and now...

01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:41.805
You've written a book.

01:26:41.935 --> 01:26:42.936
Well, actually, um...

01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:47.550
Actually, Mr. Brady,
or more correctly, the entity

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.509
claiming to inhabit Mr. Brady
wrote the initial manuscript.

01:26:51.467 --> 01:26:54.861
I read that, and my first
thought was, "entity"?

01:26:56.646 --> 01:26:58.996
Mr. Brady told me that
he was possessed by a demon.

01:26:59.692 --> 01:27:00.693
You're a psychiatrist.

01:27:00.824 --> 01:27:02.565
Did you believe him
at the time?

01:27:02.695 --> 01:27:04.175
No.

01:27:04.306 --> 01:27:05.437
But...

01:27:07.134 --> 01:27:08.310
I believe him now.

01:27:09.746 --> 01:27:10.747
So what changed?

01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:14.751
The fact that
for a brief time,

01:27:14.881 --> 01:27:17.971
the entity inhabited
me as well.

01:27:19.059 --> 01:27:20.409
And again this "entity."

01:27:20.539 --> 01:27:24.021
I mean, I can hear
Christians say, um, yeah.

01:27:24.151 --> 01:27:27.720
"Entity. Fallen spirit.
Unclean spirit. Demon."

01:27:29.026 --> 01:27:30.114
That's what he claimed to be.

01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:32.247
Uh, so...

01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:35.685
Let me go here.

01:27:35.815 --> 01:27:39.036
You were in the witness room.

01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:42.257
And you tried
to commit suicide.

01:27:44.694 --> 01:27:45.782
It wasn't my choice.

01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:50.482
See, uh, at that moment...

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.835
I was...

01:27:56.749 --> 01:28:01.885
I was overtaken by an entity
so malevolent,

01:28:02.015 --> 01:28:04.322
so powerful, so evil, that...

01:28:06.324 --> 01:28:07.934
that words can't describe it.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.111
I had control of my mind,

01:28:11.242 --> 01:28:13.636
but the entity had
control of my body.

01:28:14.593 --> 01:28:16.769
And so, against my will...

01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:19.903
I grabbed
the detective's sidearm,

01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:23.298
put the muzzle under my chin
and pulled the trigger.

01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:26.170
But...

01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:29.608
it didn't fire.

01:28:29.739 --> 01:28:31.175
So, how do you explain that?

01:28:34.831 --> 01:28:35.832
I... I can't.

01:28:37.268 --> 01:28:38.313
Um...

01:28:39.052 --> 01:28:40.184
According to
the ballistics team,

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:41.751
I pulled the trigger
three times.

01:28:42.447 --> 01:28:44.667
And they could tell
because there were

01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:48.323
three separate and distinct
strike imprints

01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:50.716
from the firing pin on
the back of the shell casing.

01:28:50.847 --> 01:28:55.242
And then when they attempted
in the ballistics lab later,

01:28:55.373 --> 01:28:57.723
the fire, the same gun,
same cartridges...

01:28:59.029 --> 01:29:00.335
It worked just fine.

01:29:01.988 --> 01:29:03.033
A believer,

01:29:03.903 --> 01:29:05.514
not a psychiatrist,
a man of science,

01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:08.560
but a believer would say
you had an encounter.

01:29:08.691 --> 01:29:10.997
Divine or demonic,
you had an encounter.

01:29:12.085 --> 01:29:15.350
- Yeah.
- So why would this demonic

01:29:16.873 --> 01:29:18.918
entity want you dead?

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.486
Punishment.

01:29:21.617 --> 01:29:23.923
For not doing what he wanted.

01:29:25.011 --> 01:29:26.012
So...

01:29:28.319 --> 01:29:33.019
You are a complex kind of guy.

01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:37.067
I mean, what happens
to an atheist,

01:29:37.894 --> 01:29:41.114
uh, that is confronted
by demonic evil?

01:29:42.551 --> 01:29:43.856
It shatters you.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:48.731
And yet the same demon
that shatters you...

01:29:50.602 --> 01:29:52.387
wrote a book, and you're here,

01:29:52.517 --> 01:29:55.172
- and you wanted it published.
- Yes.

01:29:56.521 --> 01:29:58.175
Well, no. I...

01:30:01.483 --> 01:30:03.789
He wanted it written
as an invitation

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:07.619
to follow his master
into the darkness,

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:08.751
but I...

01:30:10.274 --> 01:30:11.623
I rewrote it.

01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:14.409
I rewrote it as a warning.

01:30:16.106 --> 01:30:18.630
Revealing his plan
and begging people

01:30:18.761 --> 01:30:19.979
not to go along with it.

01:30:21.067 --> 01:30:24.201
So you're not
still doing his will?

01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:26.072
No. Absolutely not.

01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:29.075
Just logically, do you think
that's gonna work?

01:30:29.206 --> 01:30:31.121
Do you think anybody
would believe you?

01:30:32.688 --> 01:30:33.689
Only time will tell.

01:30:33.819 --> 01:30:35.691
I mean, you,
do you believe you?

01:30:35.821 --> 01:30:39.303
I mean, do you?
Are you a believer?

01:30:41.348 --> 01:30:43.350
I don't know
if I'd go that far.

01:30:45.265 --> 01:30:46.702
I mean, I suppose
I just have trouble

01:30:46.832 --> 01:30:48.834
still accepting
the idea that, um...

01:30:52.142 --> 01:30:53.186
I don't know.

01:30:54.579 --> 01:30:56.451
You will. You'll get there.

01:30:57.103 --> 01:30:58.583
You seem pretty sure of that.

01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:05.111
Um, because you are
a logical person.

01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:08.288
You're asking
logical questions.

01:31:08.419 --> 01:31:10.116
Let me take you
a step further.

01:31:10.247 --> 01:31:12.554
You are uniquely
qualified as somebody

01:31:12.684 --> 01:31:17.950
who can delineate between
mental illness and possession.

01:31:18.081 --> 01:31:19.082
I mean...

01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:20.387
At least if you're any good.

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:22.172
I mean, assuming you're good.
Are you good?

01:31:22.781 --> 01:31:23.913
I'd like to think so.

01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:26.132
I'm guessing you are.

01:31:26.872 --> 01:31:30.528
Despite the demon's
last words to you,

01:31:30.659 --> 01:31:33.226
which I'm gonna butcher,
but they are...

01:31:33.357 --> 01:31:36.316
<i>
"Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin."</i>

01:31:38.449 --> 01:31:40.016
"You've been
weighed in the balance

01:31:40.146 --> 01:31:42.540
"and found wanting."

01:31:48.067 --> 01:31:49.068
You know, um...

01:31:51.157 --> 01:31:52.942
looking back, I, um...

01:31:54.857 --> 01:31:56.336
I don't believe he was
just talking about me.

01:31:56.467 --> 01:31:58.774
I think he was talking
about all of us.

01:32:00.906 --> 01:32:03.518
There's a great battle
going on.

01:32:03.648 --> 01:32:05.955
Whether we realize it or not.

01:32:08.131 --> 01:32:09.915
The battle between
good and evil.

01:32:10.046 --> 01:32:14.616
And... we're all participants.

01:32:17.662 --> 01:32:18.750
Willing or not.

01:32:19.838 --> 01:32:21.666
So I believe that,
but that is amazing

01:32:22.711 --> 01:32:25.540
to hear from a non-believer.

01:32:26.976 --> 01:32:28.368
Um... Thank you.

01:32:28.499 --> 01:32:29.544
Thank you.

01:32:30.806 --> 01:32:32.677
We've been talking
to Dr. James Martin.

01:32:32.808 --> 01:32:34.636
He is the author of
the new book,

01:32:34.766 --> 01:32:36.376
<i>A Nefarious Plot.</i>

01:32:36.507 --> 01:32:39.249
You can find it wherever
books are sold.

01:32:39.379 --> 01:32:40.946
- Thanks, doc.
- Thank you.

01:32:45.429 --> 01:32:47.170
- Great interview, doc.
- Thanks so much.

01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:04.274
Here you go.

01:33:09.496 --> 01:33:10.541
Hello, James.

01:33:13.805 --> 01:33:14.893
Miss me?
