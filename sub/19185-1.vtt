At last, he has arrived.

his deepest apologies

convey he was merely

seeing you safely to your home.

22:27.660 --> 22:34.140
Oh, uh, I guess I
did sort of overreact.

22:34.140 --> 22:35.240
His name is Monsieur Ash.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.320
He's a wealthy
patron of the arts.

22:38.320 --> 22:43.380
A bit eccentric, perhaps,
but a most gentle man.

22:43.380 --> 22:45.990
He was quite taken
by your performance

22:45.990 --> 22:49.220
and wishes to engage you in a
private recital at Club Muse.

22:49.220 --> 22:51.300

22:58.760 --> 22:59.840
Uh, sure.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.740
That's great.

23:01.740 --> 23:04.810
I'll come around with
the car just after sunset.

OK.

thing happened today.

This woman stopped
me on the street

me to his lair.

48:55.200 --> 48:58.550
Drink from me.

48:58.550 --> 49:01.060
Take what you desire.

49:01.060 --> 49:05.060
But please, spare my life.

49:05.060 --> 49:06.510
Run from me, child.

49:06.510 --> 49:09.330
I have no wish to
violate your flesh.

49:09.330 --> 49:09.830
No.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.910
Run from me!

49:14.910 --> 49:15.410
Now!

49:58.480 --> 50:03.510
Let me go, or I swear
to God I'll kill you.

50:13.820 --> 50:18.250
Please, don't hurt me.

50:18.250 --> 50:20.630
I have no wish to hurt you.

50:20.630 --> 50:23.320
I offer you deliverance
from your pain.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.370
My friends know I'm here.

50:25.370 --> 50:27.710
They'll come looking for me.

50:27.710 --> 50:31.360
I would welcome the diversion.

50:31.360 --> 50:40.600
Sofia, to live forever is
life's most precious gift.

50:40.600 --> 50:45.470
A priceless opportunity
to perfect your art

50:45.470 --> 50:46.910
through the centuries.

50:52.160 --> 50:55.350
Accept me as your
master, and you

50:55.350 --> 50:59.110
will be an avatar
of the music world.

50:59.110 --> 50:59.610
No!

51:17.190 --> 51:21.450
Iris, I require more incense.

51:21.450 --> 51:22.610
Then you shall
have it, Dimitri.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.940
Ash, I must speak
with you at once.

51:33.550 --> 51:36.390
Why do you disturb me?

51:36.390 --> 51:38.120
Anton and Walter are
plotting to leave the country.

51:41.870 --> 51:43.310
Where are they now?

51:43.310 --> 51:44.550
Walter's in the brothel.

51:44.550 --> 51:45.750
Anton's in his lair.

51:48.750 --> 51:51.740
Tell Anton to meet me
above, and bring Walter

51:51.740 --> 51:53.270
to us immediately.

52:04.780 --> 52:07.130
You are my child, Anton.

52:07.130 --> 52:10.170
My life blood courses
through your veins.

52:10.170 --> 52:13.330
What compels you to defy me?

52:13.330 --> 52:14.290
No, no, no.

52:14.290 --> 52:16.590
Everything is taken
care of, Master.

52:16.590 --> 52:19.860
Walter will make the
transfer immediately.

52:19.860 --> 52:25.110
What reason is there to deceive
me when all that I possess,

52:25.110 --> 52:29.240
all my comforts and
protections, are yours to share?

52:29.240 --> 52:32.670
Have I not given you
all that I vowed?

52:32.670 --> 52:34.010
Yes, Ash.

52:34.010 --> 52:37.560
You are a man true to your word.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.670
And you, Anton?

52:39.670 --> 52:43.500
What good is your word to me?

52:43.500 --> 52:46.950
I swear to you, there will
be no more irregularities.

52:49.580 --> 52:52.490
Kiss my hand, Anton.

52:52.490 --> 52:56.250
Declare your devotion.

52:56.250 --> 52:58.080
You are my master, Ash.

53:01.780 --> 53:04.040
Walter.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.330
Please, join us.

53:13.320 --> 53:16.470
Anton has made his
intentions clear to me.

53:16.470 --> 53:19.140
The transfers will
be made tomorrow.

53:19.140 --> 53:22.820
Iris can confirm
the transaction.

53:22.820 --> 53:25.760
I am mortally
offended, gentlemen,

53:25.760 --> 53:30.930
that you partake my
generosity and yet continue

53:30.930 --> 53:32.300
to conspire against me.

53:32.300 --> 53:35.980
No, Ash, we are
eager to cooperate.

53:35.980 --> 53:38.350
Anton is being most generous.

53:38.350 --> 53:42.190
In my opinion, he has no
legal obligation to you.

53:42.190 --> 53:47.710
You, dear Anton,
disappoint me greatly.

53:51.130 --> 53:57.550
And you, Walter, as a
practitioner of the legal arts,

53:57.550 --> 53:58.970
are beneath my contempt.

54:02.140 --> 54:02.640
No!

54:06.480 --> 54:10.560
Both of you have
betrayed my trust.

54:24.180 --> 54:25.180
Feast, Anton.

54:28.680 --> 54:32.330
Have mercy, Master.

54:32.330 --> 54:36.300
Please, he is my only friend.

54:36.300 --> 54:39.280
Prove your devotion to me.

54:45.730 --> 54:49.200
[SCREAMS]

55:01.600 --> 55:06.160
You are my master, Ash.

55:06.160 --> 55:11.300
Your cowardice is
a danger to us all.

55:27.040 --> 55:33.200
All that I have given
you, I now take away.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.630
Have mercy, Master.

55:37.770 --> 55:41.160
There is no mercy, Anton.

55:41.160 --> 55:43.470
Only darkness eternal.

55:54.780 --> 55:59.370
You can't behave like
this in my nightclub.

55:59.370 --> 56:01.050
I could not let them leave.

56:01.050 --> 56:03.370
They would have exposed us.

56:03.370 --> 56:06.260
And what happens now
when Walter's associates

56:06.260 --> 56:08.070
call the police?

56:08.070 --> 56:10.040
Witnesses can place
him here, and I'm

56:10.040 --> 56:12.750
the one who must
face their questions.

56:12.750 --> 56:14.560
You will deal with
it as you always

56:14.560 --> 56:19.640
have, you and our
friends in high places.

56:19.640 --> 56:24.280
What goes on in your
sanctuary is no concern to me.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.100
But this?

56:26.100 --> 56:27.490
This is where I draw the line.

56:31.110 --> 56:33.850
Do not challenge me, Iris.

56:33.850 --> 56:36.160
I have troubles enough.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.780
I have been generous with you.

56:38.780 --> 56:42.650
Do not betray me, or
I shall draw the line

56:42.650 --> 56:43.670
across your throat.

56:48.110 --> 56:49.590
Bastard.

56:49.590 --> 56:52.980
CASSANDRA (OFFSCREEN):
I heard that.

56:52.980 --> 56:53.820
Burn in Hell, Cassandra.

56:56.590 --> 57:01.210
Master was
displeased with Anton,

57:01.210 --> 57:03.600
as he grows displeased with you.

57:06.850 --> 57:10.310
Anton tried to
gain his freedom.

57:10.310 --> 57:12.740
Your master holds you
in eternal slavery.

57:24.830 --> 57:26.970
Stop that, Cassandra.

57:26.970 --> 57:29.280
You're disgusting.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.670
You are the disgusting one.

57:35.660 --> 57:39.880
You are as guilty as we.

57:39.880 --> 57:53.760
And yet, we shall live forever
while you grow old and ugly

57:53.760 --> 57:57.180
and die.

57:57.180 --> 58:02.570
How long have you
been Ash's protege?

58:02.570 --> 58:06.440
Two centuries and a half.

58:06.440 --> 58:10.430
Your reign as his
favorite one has ended.

58:10.430 --> 58:15.250
Sofia has replaced
you in his affections.

58:15.250 --> 58:18.090
Jealousy becomes you, Iris.

58:18.090 --> 58:22.300
We joke amongst us how you
yearn for our master's kiss.

58:32.810 --> 58:34.990
ZACHARY NARRATING: I
lay there in a reverie,

58:34.990 --> 58:39.170
the innocent's blood like pins
and needles through my flesh.

58:39.170 --> 58:42.650
I prayed for death to release
me from my oath of vengeance,

58:42.650 --> 58:47.730
but God mocked my despair
with visions of Rebecca

58:47.730 --> 58:51.430
and my last days of
happiness a century ago.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.560
Absinthe and poetry were
my foolish passions.

59:02.560 --> 59:04.010
Rebecca was my inspiration.

59:22.670 --> 59:27.870
And Serena, the seductress
who stole my life from me.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:24.030
I had tasted less than
one glass of her blood.

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.290
I needed little to sustain me.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.540
And yet, she begged for more.

01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:01.920
When can I venture into
the great night alone?

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.280
Patience, child.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.150
There is still much
for you to learn.

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:09.920
Lie with me tonight.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.030
I crave your affection.

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:14.270
Leave me, Cassandra.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.200
My patience is short.

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.620
Master, I have a problem.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.220
What is it, Dimitri?

01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:45.610
I accidentally
killed my consort.

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:47.480
I'm sorry, Master.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.870
I couldn't help myself.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.660
Dispose what's left
of him in the pit.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.060
But first, go to
the salon and help.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.350
Iris dispose of
Anton and Walter.

01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:00.190
Anton is dead?

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.030
How?

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:09.300
He betrayed my trust,
so I beheaded him.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.870
My condolences, Master.

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:13.980
He was a vile man.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.950
Go now.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:17.380
Leave me in peace.

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:32.090
Sofia.

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.060
No.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.020
Please.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.040
Your friend Zachary
wishes to see you.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.020
Zachary, here?

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.030
Come.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:53.100
You must make yourself
more presentable.

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:45.530
No!

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:48.990
Sofia!

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:57.110
I have honored my
obligation to you.

01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:57.610
No!

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.570
Sofia!

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:04.070
Sofia!

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.550
God damn you, Ash!

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:21.980
ZACHARY NARRATING:
My senses overwhelmed

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.240
by the innocent's
blood, I did not

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.430
hear them entering the chamber.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:29.630
It was a moment of surrender
I would not repeat.

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:33.100
I searched for a crack in the
wall, a gap in the doorway

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.920
through which to escape.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.830
But where no light can
enter, a shadow cannot pass.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.430
Come on, Anton.

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:45.320
Don't be difficult.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.770
Careful, it's hot.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.310
Alas, poor Yorick.

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.780
Ow, brains!

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.800
Damn you, Anton!

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.340
Still making trouble.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.870
Give me that, you idiot.

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.350
Careful, Iris.

01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:03.180
Don't mess the floor.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.730
Leave us, Dimitri.

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:12.710
Master, I'll be in
my lair freshening up.

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.430
Don't forget my incense, Iris.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:23.320
This is the key
to Zachary's lair.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:33.110
Tomorrow, when the
sun is at its zenith,

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:35.910
take his sleeping
body to the courtyard

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:38.630
and render him to dust.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:42.010
I am not your
vampire slayer, Ash.

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:43.920
And from now on, I
want you to spare

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.560
me these intrigues of yours.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.240
But this one favor
I'll do for you

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.140
if you give me
something in return.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:59.280
Anything but what
you most desire.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:05.060
The girl, Sofia... I
want you to kill her.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.140
Do not mock me, Iris.

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:12.340
Sofia's life is more
precious to me than yours.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:17.070
Oh, God, you're
in love with her.

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:19.730
What a poor, pitiful
Romeo you are.

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:24.550
As she grows stronger,
you grow weaker.

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:27.630
Destroy her, Ash, or
she'll be your ruin.

01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:36.870
You have spirit, Sofia,
and a fierce will to live.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.160
They will serve you well
in the centuries to come.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:55.010
The hour has arrived to taste
the blood of your master.

01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:55.510
No!

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:56.440
Please, don't!

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.240
I will have you, Sofia.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.220
Embrace me willingly,
and I vow not

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.630
to spoil that
portion of your soul

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:08.060
which is the wellspring
of your artistry.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.810
No!

01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:13.720
I beg of you, Sofia.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.600
I have no wish to defile
the music in your heart.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.100
Stop!

01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:28.340
You will be mine forever.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:41.050
Zachary.

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:44.740
I'm sorry, my beloved.

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.220
Come to me.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.189
Our lives can be redeemed.

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:16.910
Ahh!

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:17.910
Let go of me!

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:19.029
Where's Ash?

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.390
I said, let go of me!

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:21.010
Where's Sofia?

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:22.960
Take me to her!

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.060
I'll point you to his lair,
into the secret tunnels.

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.810
But first, you must
agree on three things.

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:31.479
I could kill you right now for
delivering her into his hands.

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:34.840
Oh, that would be
a foolish waste.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.270
What are your conditions?

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:40.470
First, you must promise
not to betray my confidence.

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:42.189
You have my word.

01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:47.140
Second, you must take Sofia
and leave this country never

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:47.680
to return.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:54.020
I will leave when Ash and all
of his bloodline are destroyed.

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.460
I will not stand
between Ash and his fate.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:10.010
Sofia, you rest at the
threshold of mortality.

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:15.310
Tell me your desire,
life or death?

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.210
Life.

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:26.250
Will you take me
as your master,

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:29.390
honor and obey me
until eternity?

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:33.510
Yes.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.140
My blood will
suffuse you with life.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.380
You are mine now, Sofia.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.820
Cry, Sofia.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.530
Let your sadness pass.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:46.380
May I help you?

01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:10.680
ZACHARY NARRATING: I had no
blade to finish him with,

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.500
so I did the next best thing.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.320
I was too late.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.710
She had tasted his blood.

01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:36.840
He was immersed in her, which
gave me a moment's advantage.

01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.800
Zachary!

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.800
Come with me!

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:30.730
Master, you're wounded!

01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:33.600
Go after them, Cassandra.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.400
Lead me to them.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.350
I'm too weak to fly.

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:38.310
Yes, Master.

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:46.930
Do not falter, Sofia.

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:47.760
Keep moving.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.510
I can't!

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:49.010
It hurts!

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:50.060
It is the coming of the dawn.

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.840
We must find shelter.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.470
CASSANDRA (OFFSCREEN):
Master, this way.

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.420
Zachary!

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:15.690
Deliver Sofia to me, and I
promise you safe passage.

01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:20.050
I can't go on!

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.040
I'm dying!

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.030
You must keep moving!

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:25.020
[SOBS]

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.130
Sofia, come to me!

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.190
You'll make a pretty
prize for my master.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:24.200
Sofia, come to me.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:33.180
The dawn approaches,
and soon it will

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:36.180
be too late to seek sanctuary.

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:42.660
Strike the first
blow, Cassandra.

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.160
Deliver me from
the hands of fate.

01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:01.010
[SCREAMS]

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.490
Zachary, help me!

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.010
We must find a
resting place quickly.

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:30.470
Quickly!

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:31.350
Inside here.

01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:41.560
We will lie here today.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.850
Tonight, we'll find
a safer sanctuary.

01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:51.560
Thank you, Zachary.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.140
Do not thank me, Sofia.

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.210
I brought you no salvation.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.890
Why?

01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:03.370
What's going to happen to me?

01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:06.440
Only one thing is for certain.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.330
Never again will you feel
the warmth of the sun.

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:12.600
ZACHARY NARRATING: I had
stolen her from Ash's lair.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.910
I could offer her protection,
teach her to survive.

01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:19.240
But I was not her true master.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:23.990
Her life, like mine, would
be an endless nightmare.
