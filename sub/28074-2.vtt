WEBVTT

00:15.348 --> 00:18.893
I was basically born
in this butcher shop...

00:21.271 --> 00:24.357
to a family of carnivores,

00:25.734 --> 00:27.402
and I loved food.

00:33.074 --> 00:37.078
In the butcher shop,
anything that the customer doesn't want

00:37.162 --> 00:39.080
is the family's food.

00:41.750 --> 00:47.255
My grandma cooked legs, snouts,

00:47.338 --> 00:49.507
and cooked tails.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.386
All of the bellies, the blood, guts...

00:55.513 --> 00:58.224
It was paradise for the gluttons.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.690
But there was a problem.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.651
I never saw a steak.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.740
I understood that good cuts existed,

01:13.823 --> 01:15.992
but just for customers.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.496
There were none for Dario.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.584
It was a great pain.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.261
Then, when I turned 18, my dad told me,

01:35.345 --> 01:36.387
"You're an adult.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.682
I'll give you a steak."

01:47.232 --> 01:48.983
The excitement, it was...

01:50.193 --> 01:52.987
it was really the first time...

02:00.870 --> 02:02.747
And the first bite...

02:18.763 --> 02:20.807
It was almost a shock.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.062
I said,

02:26.146 --> 02:30.233
"For all my life, years and years,
I've waited for steak.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.278
And now, after the first time...

02:34.529 --> 02:36.197
it was good, but...

02:36.990 --> 02:39.367
everything else that my grandma cooked

02:39.951 --> 02:41.286
was paradise."

05:08.349 --> 05:10.393
On that day I was in Miami.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.520
I could not sleep,

05:12.603 --> 05:15.690
so I turned on the television.

05:15.773 --> 05:20.153
I turned to CNN,
and I saw Dario with steaks in his hands.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.369
And I said, "But am I awake
or still dreaming?"

05:30.913 --> 05:34.000
It really was a surprising thing.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.029
Long live the meat!

06:07.241 --> 06:12.121
"You, citizens, called me Ciacco

06:12.205 --> 06:15.666
for the damnable sin of gluttony."

06:51.702 --> 06:56.124
Every single part, every single muscle,
every single piece of meat

06:56.207 --> 06:58.167
has its own quality,

06:58.251 --> 07:01.379
which he manages to bring out and enhance.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.736
Good morning, Lorenzo.

08:07.236 --> 08:10.615
-How's it going? All good?
-How is it? Pretty good.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.075
Brought the pig.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.126
Slowly, mind the step.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.252
Yes.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.712
We did it.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.798
Throw it up there.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.801
Wait.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.637
Go, go.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.846
Get it up.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.432
We did it.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.689
Good.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.384
It's a beautiful pig.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.305
And I...

09:17.682 --> 09:19.308
am its butcher.

09:24.188 --> 09:28.901
Every time that I'm
in front of the animal's death...

09:30.069 --> 09:34.156
I think of the life, of the respect,

09:34.240 --> 09:37.243
of the responsibility
of using everything well...

09:38.744 --> 09:42.415
of not offending this death.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.379
Not even a small bone will go wasted.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.010
This is being a butcher.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.557
Beautiful hams.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.482
Dario is coming in a bit.
We gotta prepare some stuff.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.165
I've brought food!

10:24.915 --> 10:26.584
Steaks!

10:26.667 --> 10:27.793
Bread!

10:27.877 --> 10:31.547
-Wine.
-Good wine. I even brought oil.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.661
I'm not a cook.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.459
I'm a butcher that cooks.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.261
It's extremely simple.

11:19.345 --> 11:23.599
At the start,
drink a glass of red wine.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.524
This inspires better cooking.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.533
And then, forget every grill technique.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.037
Finally...

11:46.288 --> 11:47.873
rely on instinct.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.591
Take a Florentine steak...

11:57.675 --> 12:00.886
or the boneless sirloin.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.596
Eight minutes per side.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.313
Each side without salt, without oil.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.110
Meat and fire.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.903
Think of the origin.

12:20.281 --> 12:24.702
It's all about simple things,
done with pleasure.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.079
This is important.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.866
At the table, good salt,
or, even better, the scent of Chianti.

13:06.076 --> 13:09.747
But the first bite has to be natural.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.752
It has to be meat without anything...

13:17.838 --> 13:19.757
as it was from the start.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.718
Nothing simpler.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.453
A nice Florentine steak!

13:49.537 --> 13:51.872
-Look how it is.
-Great, fantastic.

13:51.956 --> 13:56.210
-It doesn't get better than this.
-That's really exciting.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.504
It's a wonder.

14:28.659 --> 14:32.746
My butcher shop is called
Antica Macelleria Cecchini...

14:33.539 --> 14:38.335
because it's 250 years
of butcher tradition,

14:38.419 --> 14:39.962
always from father to son.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.216
I was born at home.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.012
The first person I saw
was my dad

14:48.095 --> 14:50.472
with a butcher jacket.

14:51.891 --> 14:58.606
As soon as I was born, I had right away
the mark of the butcher.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.483
In the tradition,

15:01.567 --> 15:04.737
when you're 13, you start working.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.159
My dad started to pass his work to me.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.665
What I liked the most

15:16.749 --> 15:23.172
was when he'd take me with him
to the houses of farmers to buy animals.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.177
Here they are.

15:30.346 --> 15:35.559
On the farm,
animals were part of the family.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.729
What a marvel.

15:40.397 --> 15:43.442
When I looked in the eyes of the cows,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.986
they looked like mine.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.657
This affected me.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.621
I loved the animals.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.000
And I wanted to take care of them.

16:03.545 --> 16:10.010
And the most important figure
in caring for animals

16:10.094 --> 16:11.762
wasn't the butcher.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.181
It was the veterinarian.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.940
And this idea

16:23.023 --> 16:28.487
that I could go around
with a pair of country pants

16:29.989 --> 16:31.865
and take care of animals...

16:33.701 --> 16:35.035
It was a dream.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.709
I didn't want to be a butcher.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.798
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.354
Good?

17:02.438 --> 17:04.732
-Everything's very good.
-Good.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.567
Better than this...

17:12.406 --> 17:16.452
-Want some wine?
-Yes, thanks. Why not?

17:23.667 --> 17:24.543
What's the saying?

17:24.626 --> 17:27.046
"The smoke always goes
towards the gorgeous ones."

17:39.391 --> 17:41.185
What a dinner, my love.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.270
I'm hungry, finally.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.688
Steaks...

17:52.362 --> 17:53.614
Here we are.

17:59.119 --> 18:02.873
Hallelujah! Look at this marvel.
It's like a fallen moon.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.833
Look at this marvel! Look!

18:04.917 --> 18:06.543
Here's the steak!

18:08.754 --> 18:13.717
My family has always been
a welcoming family.

18:13.801 --> 18:18.013
When there would be a guest,
we would add a seat at the table,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.432
whether there were one or ten guests.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.226
If the season...

18:22.309 --> 18:23.227
Double.

18:23.310 --> 18:27.189
If the season keeps going

18:27.272 --> 18:30.901
There's enough for all of your relatives

18:30.984 --> 18:34.863
Mom doesn't, doesn't, doesn't want me
To make love with you

18:34.947 --> 18:38.826
But come, love, when Mom isn't there

18:40.577 --> 18:43.163
That period of childhood,

18:43.247 --> 18:47.334
with my family and family friends,

18:48.377 --> 18:50.754
every day was a day of celebration.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.050
It entered my DNA.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.770
Here's the flank.

20:12.044 --> 20:17.591
I try and take a crumb
of the joy from my childhood

20:17.674 --> 20:20.761
and bring it into the restaurant.

20:22.512 --> 20:27.184
I want to make everyone
who comes to the butcher shop think

20:27.267 --> 20:29.061
it's a day of celebration.

20:50.874 --> 20:55.379
It can be difficult,
when you've had such a good childhood,

20:55.462 --> 20:58.423
to take on the adult world.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.302
Sometimes I've even said to myself that

21:02.386 --> 21:06.682
having it this good
doesn't prepare you for life.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.270
So, I wasn't really prepared for life.

21:11.353 --> 21:15.232
I was prepared to keep living well.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.157
One day...

21:24.908 --> 21:26.952
my dad gets home,

21:27.035 --> 21:31.039
calls my grandma,
calls my sister, Marina,

21:31.123 --> 21:32.582
and calls me...

21:34.084 --> 21:35.002
and tells me,

21:35.585 --> 21:38.922
"There's a problem. Mom is sick."

21:46.096 --> 21:51.518
For us, it was the end of harmony.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.231
Falling out of paradise

21:57.065 --> 21:59.151
and slowly entering...

21:59.735 --> 22:02.446
into the hell of cancer.

22:07.284 --> 22:13.582
My memory of that period
was of a nightmare.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.130
It's not real. It's all a dream.

22:21.048 --> 22:25.052
I'm sure I will wake up from this dream.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.642
It wasn't a dream.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.604
We woke up,

22:35.687 --> 22:37.356
and my mother was dead.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.463
What a wonder!

23:02.172 --> 23:04.508
Panzano in Chianti.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.639
When I was a child,

23:12.307 --> 23:14.601
those were my windows.

23:15.102 --> 23:20.232
I spent all my adolescence,
until I was 20,

23:20.315 --> 23:23.944
opening the windows
and looking at the horizon,

23:24.027 --> 23:29.491
trying to see as far as possible,
because my village was small

23:29.574 --> 23:34.579
and I really wished
to go   as far as possible.

23:45.465 --> 23:48.301
The veterinary university was in Pisa...

23:51.680 --> 23:54.224
100 kilometers from Panzano.

23:57.561 --> 24:03.275
In Pisa, I was a student
with an excessive desire for knowledge.

24:06.528 --> 24:11.074
Every day I studied to be a vet.

24:13.368 --> 24:18.623
I was living a peaceful life,
filled with many hopes.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.043
That lasted for a year.

24:30.260 --> 24:34.306
One day, I was studying,
and my sister called me.

24:35.640 --> 24:39.436
She told me, "Dad is sick.
They're bringing him to the hospital."

24:49.821 --> 24:53.533
The love I had
for my father was so strong

24:53.617 --> 24:55.535
that I couldn't believe it...

24:57.913 --> 24:59.498
until the end.

25:03.251 --> 25:08.965
My dad spent all of our family's money
to cure my mother...

25:12.594 --> 25:15.931
and I was the last hope for the family.

25:27.734 --> 25:32.697
I understood it was the moment
to put on my shoulders...

25:33.281 --> 25:36.034
not only the family tradition,

25:36.117 --> 25:37.869
but the family, too.

25:40.914 --> 25:44.000
All the hopes I had for my life,

25:44.501 --> 25:49.381
my choice to study to be a veterinarian,
of leaving the butcher shop,

25:49.464 --> 25:51.424
died with my dad.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.728
I won't be the one that saves the animals.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.192
I will be someone who kills animals.

26:13.113 --> 26:16.283
The feeling was that I had died, too.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.108
A nice layer of fat.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.263
This...

27:22.682 --> 27:25.310
This is the hardest part...

27:28.438 --> 27:30.273
killing an animal.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.153
It's the most difficult part for me.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.869
We're trying to make it
as painless as possible.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.747
But death is painful.

28:52.897 --> 28:56.484
I'll hold your hand there

28:57.861 --> 29:01.156
And there you'll say yes

29:02.323 --> 29:05.827
And we'll go away

29:05.910 --> 29:09.164
Let's go, my love

29:09.664 --> 29:13.376
I would and I would not

29:13.460 --> 29:15.628
It's trembling

29:45.950 --> 29:49.037
I had really beautiful memories
in Panzano,

29:49.954 --> 29:55.043
especially at the butcher shop
when the family was all together.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.341
But when I returned...

30:03.092 --> 30:05.470
there was an incredible void.

30:08.598 --> 30:13.645
I hated waking up in the morning
and being forced...

30:13.728 --> 30:15.438
to earn money.

30:15.522 --> 30:20.819
But the worst thing is
that I wasn't able to earn money.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.737
Every month it was a little worse.

30:30.328 --> 30:34.582
No one was here
to teach me how to be a butcher.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.009
When I tried to cut the beef,

30:45.885 --> 30:48.054
all I could see was the dead cow.

30:49.472 --> 30:51.266
And I would cut my own hands.

30:59.858 --> 31:05.655
Every strike of the knife on my hands
was like a slap at my dignity.

31:09.784 --> 31:14.247
I felt ashamed being seen by the customers
with my hands all bandaged.

31:18.418 --> 31:22.297
I would think,
"You're the last of the Cecchini.

31:23.172 --> 31:27.010
Do you want the tradition
of all of the generations to end...

31:27.635 --> 31:30.763
because you're not capable
of being a butcher?"

31:36.519 --> 31:41.566
I felt as if I was in a prison.

31:42.942 --> 31:47.280
And my prison
was called Macelleria Cecchini.

32:14.098 --> 32:17.310
Count them. There must be 24.

32:23.983 --> 32:26.611
Before dying, my dad told me,

32:26.694 --> 32:29.197
"If you ever need help,

32:29.280 --> 32:33.701
find Orlando and he'll show you the way."

32:34.494 --> 32:37.705
So, I went looking for Orlando.

32:46.255 --> 32:51.594
Orlando was the meat selector for my dad.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.890
He became my teacher.

32:56.474 --> 33:02.313
These will be sugar
for the clients' palates.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.314
Yes.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.318
He was trying to do his best,

33:08.403 --> 33:10.989
but he didn't have a lot of experience.

33:11.906 --> 33:15.326
It was a matter
of taking control of the situation.

33:18.329 --> 33:21.916
One day, when I was cutting the meat,

33:22.834 --> 33:27.922
I told him, "For me,
to butcher an animal is a great pain."

33:30.591 --> 33:33.886
Orlando started making gestures
with one hand.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.266
He said, "You don't understand.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.561
It's not just about cutting meat."

33:47.233 --> 33:52.030
The next day, he took me
to the houses of farmers...

33:53.114 --> 33:55.992
to show me what he meant.

34:01.330 --> 34:04.459
He said, "When an animal is born,

34:05.376 --> 34:08.546
we must try to give it
the best life possible.

34:10.089 --> 34:14.093
And when the animal dies by our hand,

34:15.386 --> 34:19.807
we try to respect the gift of the animal.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.691
You're handling a piece of life.

34:30.651 --> 34:33.237
You have to never forget that."

34:36.949 --> 34:40.411
I never thought this way,

34:41.746 --> 34:45.458
that the butcher has a path in life

34:46.125 --> 34:48.503
not detached from the animals,

34:49.587 --> 34:50.755
but beside them.

34:54.467 --> 34:58.054
The next day, I put on the butcher apron,

34:58.930 --> 35:02.058
and I never took it off again.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.459
This one is exceptional.

35:29.252 --> 35:32.755
-Look, what a beautiful animal.
-The structure, right?

35:32.839 --> 35:34.006
Beautiful.

35:34.590 --> 35:37.009
We should take it home.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.303
Take it. Let's bring it home.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.600
With Orlando,

35:45.434 --> 35:49.438
my work started to have meaning.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.945
I was trying to respect
the gift of the animal.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.283
But there was a problem.

36:01.284 --> 36:07.123
Customers didn't want anything
except a filet or steak.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.877
I wasn't able to sell the whole animal.

36:13.796 --> 36:19.844
I don't think it's right to kill an animal
just for a steak or a filet.

36:23.389 --> 36:26.726
I tried to explain this to my customers,

36:27.852 --> 36:29.812
but they cared less and less.

36:35.693 --> 36:38.404
I was looking for a solution.

36:43.492 --> 36:47.788
So I said, "The only way
to not waste anything

36:48.623 --> 36:53.085
is to put the food on the plate
and make them understand."

37:05.681 --> 37:08.351
The spark ignited.

37:09.977 --> 37:14.232
I was going to teach people
how to eat well.

37:18.861 --> 37:23.282
I decided to open Solociccia,
"Just Meat," my first restaurant.

37:35.962 --> 37:40.633
I started to cook the menu of my family...

37:45.554 --> 37:50.268
made with all parts of the animal
which are considered less noble.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.065
From snout to tail,

37:56.148 --> 37:59.110
legs, tendons, everything...

38:00.444 --> 38:02.280
but no steak.

40:11.867 --> 40:16.580
For years, I had
this feeling of being dead.

40:17.873 --> 40:21.210
The joy from my childhood wasn't there.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.508
But after I opened the restaurant,

40:27.591 --> 40:30.052
little by little,
life started to come back.

40:32.054 --> 40:34.974
The taste of my grandmother's food,

40:35.057 --> 40:37.351
my dad's traditions,

40:38.561 --> 40:42.148
and my mom's love of celebration...

40:43.065 --> 40:44.650
it was all there.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.907
It feels as if my family...

40:53.409 --> 40:57.329
had kept on living.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.966
Good evening, everyone!

41:09.049 --> 41:10.176
Welcome.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.720
Good evening.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.268
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:01.977 --> 42:03.938
kind guests,

42:04.480 --> 42:07.525
the Costata alla Fiorentina!

42:30.089 --> 42:31.799
At the beginning,

42:31.882 --> 42:36.554
I thought it wasn't possible
to follow my dreams

42:36.637 --> 42:38.681
of taking care of the animals.

42:47.314 --> 42:51.235
But over the years, I understood that...

42:52.027 --> 42:56.115
It's not
that a veterinarian saves the animals

42:56.198 --> 42:58.284
and the butcher kills them.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.540
It's that we're all together.

43:08.919 --> 43:12.756
The veterinarian is the one
that takes care of animals,

43:13.465 --> 43:17.886
and the butcher is the one
who has the most important task

43:18.679 --> 43:24.226
of teaching humans
that you have to value everything.

43:29.898 --> 43:32.776
Now I know where my place is.

43:34.361 --> 43:37.197
It's behind the butcher's chopping board.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.035
It's my center of the world.
