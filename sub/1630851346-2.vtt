11:29.640 --> 11:30.610

11:32.240 --> 11:33.240
in the past and stuff,

11:33.240 --> 11:35.110

we’ve made up since then.

11:35.110 --> 11:36.140

11:36.140 --> 11:38.240

11:44.910 --> 11:46.040
- We always fight though, bro.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.810
Like we’re sisters.
That’s just going to happen.

11:47.810 --> 11:49.110
- It’s just going to happen,
but I don’t think

11:49.110 --> 11:51.010
it’s gonna happen
as bad as it has happened.

11:51.010 --> 11:51.610
- No.

11:51.610 --> 11:53.340
So I guess, like, if we did get
our own place or whatever,

11:53.340 --> 11:55.940

like, houses and apartments

11:55.940 --> 11:56.840

11:56.840 --> 11:58.780

11:58.780 --> 12:00.580
I found a trailer
or something like that,

12:00.580 --> 12:01.780
but it’s like one
of the nice ones

12:01.780 --> 12:04.270
that’s in, like, one of the

12:04.270 --> 12:05.240

I was pregnant,

14:22.810 --> 14:25.470
I really, really,
really thought about abortion.

14:25.470 --> 14:28.370

"I don’t want to be
with this dude.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.340

14:32.340 --> 14:33.010
- Really.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.910
- And then we ended up
getting back together

14:34.910 --> 14:36.170
to try to make it work
because I was,

14:36.170 --> 14:38.400
like, I can’t bring myself
to have an abortion.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.370
And I’m so glad I didn’t
obviously, but you know,

14:42.370 --> 14:45.140
Camille’s almost
a year old and...

I do not care about my son.

Mom’s always been hard

18:24.200 --> 18:27.130
I think it’s just...it’s harder
’cause all the attention’s,

18:27.130 --> 18:30.040
like,
on me since you’re not there.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.280
Just seems like she’s always
on my case about everything.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.000
- Yeah.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.570
- I also feel like I don’t get
as much credit

18:38.570 --> 18:39.470
for being a single mom

18:39.470 --> 18:41.470
because she feels like
she helps so much.

18:41.470 --> 18:44.240
- She calls herself like--
- A second parent.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.340
- A second parent. Exactly.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.070
I hate that
because it’s like her way

18:47.070 --> 18:49.240
of taking away the fact that
because you helped me

18:49.240 --> 18:50.670
that makes me not
a single parent anymore

18:50.670 --> 18:54.670
when realistically, no,
I am still doing it by myself.

18:54.670 --> 18:57.200
- So how are you gonna
make things work with mom?

18:57.200 --> 18:58.380
- I’m gonna have a talk
with her,

18:58.380 --> 19:00.640
but she’s hard to talk to.
Like sometimes I just feel like

19:00.640 --> 19:02.470
just avoiding it
and then I move out.

19:02.470 --> 19:05.970
It is what it is, you know,
just never bring it up.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.100
That sounds like a better plan
to me than sitting here

19:08.100 --> 19:12.100
and telling her, like,
I feel this, this, and this.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.100

19:13.100 --> 19:15.070

19:15.070 --> 19:18.310
it’s more of, like,
I need to be financially ready.

19:18.310 --> 19:19.470
I need to be physically ready

19:19.470 --> 19:20.710

mentally ready.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.130
Everything just needs
to be ready

19:22.130 --> 19:24.670
and then we can move
and then we can be on our own.

19:24.670 --> 19:26.670

she’s still the only person
I’m talking to.

20:17.100 --> 20:20.170

- She’s seen him, yeah.

20:40.570 --> 20:41.470
- Oh, wow.

20:41.470 --> 20:44.540
- She called me,
like a month ago

20:44.540 --> 20:47.380
and asked me could she see
Amour,

20:47.380 --> 20:49.200
but we’re supposed
to like set up a day

20:49.200 --> 20:54.070
to meet each other.
On my end, I forgot honestly.

20:54.070 --> 20:54.870
- She’s--she’s mad.

20:54.870 --> 20:57.640
- She said she wasn’t dealing
with us until her son got home,

20:57.640 --> 21:00.410
but who knows
when the hell that will be?

21:00.410 --> 21:02.200
- And y’all don’t know yet?
- No.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.410
Nobody knows an official day.

21:03.410 --> 21:07.310
At this point, I don’t want no
personal relationship with her.

21:07.310 --> 21:09.100
- I’ma just say I-I feel like,

21:09.100 --> 21:11.770
you know, I definitely think
you should call her

21:11.770 --> 21:15.410
’cause it’s been a long time
since she’s seen her grandson.

21:15.410 --> 21:16.540
- Yeah.
- You know?

21:16.540 --> 21:19.740
And that’s--he’s still
a part of that side so.

21:19.740 --> 21:21.470
- I feel like I’ll be
a little skeptical

21:21.470 --> 21:25.900
’cause every time I get her
a chance, she ruins it.

21:25.900 --> 21:29.280
She [bleep] up. And I’m--

21:29.280 --> 21:30.130
- Over it.

21:30.130 --> 21:32.130
- I’m over it but I don’t know.

21:32.130 --> 21:35.200
- In reality, you do have
to do with her

21:35.200 --> 21:38.770
until Zay comes home
for the most part.

21:38.770 --> 21:41.540
And you don’t know when that is
so long as you know

21:41.540 --> 21:44.200
you played your part
at the end of the day,

21:44.200 --> 21:45.410
Carla can’t have
nothing to say.

21:45.410 --> 21:47.310
- But I’m not gon’ keep
giving her too many chances

21:47.310 --> 21:49.380
so like
I’m not just gon’ show you

21:49.380 --> 21:50.670
that every time
you do something

21:50.670 --> 21:51.870
or you act
a certain type of way

21:51.870 --> 21:54.670
that you can just come back
whenever you please either.

21:54.670 --> 21:56.710
So she better tread carefully

21:56.710 --> 21:59.670
’cause I’m not playing
with that [inaudible].

21:59.670 --> 22:01.800

feeling that way either.

I’m keeping Camille

22:54.430 --> 22:58.400

and for my twisted benefit,

22:58.400 --> 22:59.230
something like that.

22:59.230 --> 23:01.200
Like, it was a big,
long paragraph.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.070

that you’re disrespectful

23:04.070 --> 23:05.800

I’m not doing it like that.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.140
You don’t provide for her.

23:07.140 --> 23:08.660
And he’s like,
"I take care of her just fine.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.170
"Sorry that I’m actually
a good dad

23:10.170 --> 23:13.300

have you dragging me down."

23:13.300 --> 23:14.830
You know, like I just--I
can’t do this anymore.

I’m--I’m not going to do that

23:20.470 --> 23:21.630
- Yeah.
- I’m not.

23:21.630 --> 23:23.830
- Did he take all of his stuff?

23:23.830 --> 23:25.800
- He took, like,
a couple outfits

23:25.800 --> 23:28.400
I’m pretty sure
and he took his Xbox.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.730
I think he took his deodorant.
There’s still some stuff left.

23:32.730 --> 23:34.430
And I’ve asked him
several different times

23:34.430 --> 23:35.830

And he’s like,

23:35.830 --> 23:39.370

we could half rent

assume that.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.370
- And then you’re not going
to have a place to live.

25:50.370 --> 25:51.830
- Because we haven’t
even argued in forever.

25:51.830 --> 25:53.630
And the only time that we did
argue was because of you.

25:53.630 --> 25:54.800
All I know is that
if we get a place

25:54.800 --> 25:55.990
in anything like that happened,

25:55.990 --> 25:57.760
it would be in my name anyway
’cause I’m telling her

25:57.760 --> 25:59.370
I’m not getting a place
in both of our names

25:59.370 --> 26:00.660
’cause I want this
to be my place.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.300
Like if she wants to go half
and half on rent,

26:02.300 --> 26:03.800
we could live together,
hell yeah, but I don’t know.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.960
- She probably feels
the same way.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.960
She wants it to be in her name.
- I don’t know about her.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.300
- It’s not as easy
as y’all think it is though,

26:10.300 --> 26:11.990
that’s what I think.
- I don’t think it’s easy.

26:11.990 --> 26:14.430
It doesn’t have to be easy
for me to do it.

26:14.430 --> 26:15.140
I’m a single mom.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.890
I got benefits in this [bleep]
state. I can get food stamps.

26:16.890 --> 26:19.430
I can get into an apartment
right now for $50 [bleep].

26:19.430 --> 26:20.960
$50 I can move
into an apartment.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.960
- You can, you can, you can.
You ain’t done that [bleep].

26:22.960 --> 26:24.960
- I’m not [bleep]
pop off again, dude. For real.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.370
- Okay, you ain’t done
that [bleep].

26:26.370 --> 26:29.500
- Okay.
Well, this conversation’s over.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.830
I have benefits in this state,
multiple benefits.

26:32.830 --> 26:34.930
I can tell them right now
that I want to move

26:34.930 --> 26:35.990
out of my mom’s house

26:35.990 --> 26:37.730
and I don’t got nowhere else
to go and they’ll move me

26:37.730 --> 26:39.830
in right now for $50.
You got me [bleep] up.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.700
- Okay.
- I’ll move out whenever.

26:45.990 --> 26:48.930
- I’m done with
this [bleep], man.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.680
<b><i>- Since X'Zayveon isn't</i></b>

26:57.750 --> 27:00.090

27:00.150 --> 27:03.120

27:03.190 --> 27:05.690

27:05.760 --> 27:09.160

27:13.330 --> 27:16.740
<b>because honestly, it doesn't</b>

27:16.800 --> 27:18.370
<b><i>It's going to be</i></b>

27:18.440 --> 27:21.370
<b><i>if one of us</i></b>
<b><i>does not break the cycle.</i></b>

27:21.440 --> 27:23.280

27:23.340 --> 27:24.510
<b>- Nothing.</b>

27:24.580 --> 27:26.010
<b>I had a conversation</b>
<b>with Carla.</b>

27:26.080 --> 27:27.510
<b>- What she say?</b>

27:27.580 --> 27:30.280
<b>- That she wanted to have</b>

27:30.350 --> 27:32.620

27:32.690 --> 27:35.820

27:35.890 --> 27:37.620

27:37.690 --> 27:38.860
<b>- No, I'm going.</b>

27:38.920 --> 27:40.730
<b>- I'm going to go with you</b>
<b>to meet her.</b>

27:40.790 --> 27:42.260
<b>I think</b>

27:42.330 --> 27:43.960

27:44.030 --> 27:45.700
<b>and nobody else has anything</b>

27:45.760 --> 27:46.870
<b>- Yeah.</b>

27:46.930 --> 27:48.300
<b>- So I do have something</b>
<b>to do with it.</b>

27:48.370 --> 27:49.500
<b>- And the only reason</b>
<b>her son not there</b>

27:49.570 --> 27:50.970
<b>is 'cause he locked up.</b>

27:51.040 --> 27:54.510
<b>- Exactly. But I just say</b>
<b>when you get in there,</b>

27:54.570 --> 27:55.940
<b>let her do all the talking.</b>

27:56.010 --> 27:57.580
<b>- Please do.</b>
<b>- Kiaya.</b>

27:57.640 --> 27:59.380
<b>- What, y'all don't gotta</b>
<b>prep talk me. I am--</b>

27:59.450 --> 28:01.010
<b>- No, we do.</b>
<b>- We got to.</b>

28:01.080 --> 28:03.320
<b>- Let her talk</b>
<b>because there's gonna be things</b>

28:03.380 --> 28:04.820
<b>that you don't agree with.</b>
<b>- And you--</b>

28:04.880 --> 28:06.490
<b>- Gotta learn to shut up.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

28:06.550 --> 28:07.920
<b>- 'Cause don't get me wrong,</b>
<b>I'm over</b>

28:07.990 --> 28:09.820
<b>everything that happened</b>
<b>'cause it's already happened,</b>

28:09.890 --> 28:11.760
<b>which is why I was open to it</b>
<b>in the first place.</b>

28:11.820 --> 28:14.860
<b>But what I'm not over is you're</b>
<b>not going to run in and out</b>

28:14.930 --> 28:17.630

<b>not going your way.</b>

28:17.700 --> 28:19.100

28:20.800 --> 28:23.570
<b>You're not going to talk to me</b>

28:23.640 --> 28:25.600

<b>She gotta fuss by herself</b>

28:25.670 --> 28:27.370
<b>and then</b>
<b>she makes herself look crazy.</b>

28:27.440 --> 28:30.010

28:31.310 --> 28:32.750

29:29.070 --> 29:30.470

29:30.540 --> 29:32.540
<b>- He's over a year old,</b>

29:32.600 --> 29:33.970
<b>I don't feel like that's--</b>

29:34.040 --> 29:35.770
<b>- And that's fine.</b>
<b>You can keep your baby.</b>

29:35.840 --> 29:37.780
<b>But when he comes to me</b>
<b>and say why didn't you,</b>

29:37.840 --> 29:40.350
<b>I'ma say 'cause you had</b>
<b>two dummies, they raised you.</b>

29:40.410 --> 29:41.910
<b>- I am not a [bleep] dummy.</b>

29:41.980 --> 29:44.920
<b>I raised him by myself.</b>
<b>He doesn't give me [bleep].</b>

29:44.980 --> 29:46.750
<b>- She said everything</b>
<b>she's doing</b>

29:46.820 --> 29:48.620
<b>is in the best interest</b>
<b>for Izaiah.</b>

29:48.690 --> 29:50.590

29:50.660 --> 29:52.660
<b><i>- Okay, look,</i></b>
<b><i>I'll be there next Friday.</i></b>

29:52.730 --> 29:55.360

29:55.430 --> 29:57.960

29:58.030 --> 30:02.970
<b><i>- About just some things, some</i></b>

30:11.210 --> 30:14.880

30:20.790 --> 30:23.790

30:23.860 --> 30:25.520
<b>I haven't had a chance</b>
<b>to talk to you about this yet</b>

30:25.590 --> 30:27.090
<b>'cause you've been busy</b>
<b>with work</b>

30:27.230 --> 30:30.630
<b>and I haven't really seen you,</b>
<b>but Annette called</b>

30:30.700 --> 30:34.470
<b>and she wants me to meet</b>
<b>with her Friday.</b>

30:34.530 --> 30:37.040
<b>She sent me some random clothes</b>
<b>for Izaiah a few months ago,</b>

30:37.100 --> 30:39.570
<b>but I never reached out to her</b>
<b>'cause I felt weird.</b>

30:39.640 --> 30:41.910
<b>Originally, I told her</b>
<b>that I would go.</b>

30:41.970 --> 30:43.680
<b>I mean, I was kinda</b>
<b>caught off guard.</b>

30:43.740 --> 30:47.250
<b>I was like, "Yeah, just let me</b>
<b>know when and where."</b>

30:47.250 --> 30:49.880
<b>But now I don't really know</b>
<b>if that's what I want to do.</b>

30:49.950 --> 30:51.820
<b>I'm kind of having</b>
<b>second thoughts on it.</b>

30:51.880 --> 30:55.250
<b>- What's making you right now,</b>
<b>like, over, like, rethink it.</b>

30:55.320 --> 30:57.860
<b>- I feel like it's kind of</b>
<b>a waste of my time.</b>

30:57.920 --> 30:59.560
<b>You know, we're moving on</b>
<b>with our lives.</b>

30:59.630 --> 31:00.930
<b>I just want to keep Stephan</b>

31:00.990 --> 31:02.760
<b>and, like,</b>
<b>her just in the past.</b>

31:02.830 --> 31:04.860
<b>But it's like, if she comes in</b>
<b>just like, "Oh, I'm sorry.</b>

31:04.930 --> 31:06.670
<b>I should have done</b>
<b>this better, done that."</b>

31:06.730 --> 31:08.370
<b>It's like I still don't have</b>
<b>any sympathy for her.</b>

31:08.430 --> 31:09.840
<b>- Yeah.</b>

31:09.900 --> 31:11.640
<b>- Like my thing is,</b>
<b>you're a terrible mother.</b>

31:11.700 --> 31:13.040
<b>You're probably going to be</b>
<b>a terrible grandmother</b>

31:13.110 --> 31:14.570
<b>and I don't want her to, like,</b>
<b>mess Izaiah</b>

31:14.640 --> 31:15.770
<b>up how I feel like she's messed</b>

31:15.840 --> 31:17.380
<b>Stephan up you know</b>
<b>what I mean?</b>

31:17.440 --> 31:19.040
<b>What's the point of me</b>
<b>meeting with her.</b>

31:19.110 --> 31:22.210
<b>- I mean, I just feel like you</b>
<b>should just go talk to her</b>

31:22.210 --> 31:23.420
<b>and just get it over with.</b>

31:23.480 --> 31:25.050
<b>You never had that closure</b>
<b>with her.</b>

31:25.120 --> 31:27.350
<b>I mean, Stephan knows</b>
<b>how you feel towards him,</b>

31:27.420 --> 31:31.420
<b>but why not just one last time,</b>
<b>meet with her and talk</b>

31:31.490 --> 31:32.790
<b>and just get it over with.</b>

31:32.860 --> 31:34.430
<b>- I just think I need to think</b>
<b>on it some more</b>

31:34.490 --> 31:35.830
<b>'cause I was just</b>
<b>caught off guard.</b>

31:35.890 --> 31:37.560
<b>I hadn't really</b>

31:37.630 --> 31:39.800
<b>But now that I'm thinking</b>

Hopefully, like,
help our relationship

32:28.860 --> 32:31.530
because I feel like
it’s gone down so much.

32:31.530 --> 32:33.860
- I just feel like a lot
of times when you’re home,

32:33.860 --> 32:35.400
you’re just, like,
pissed off that you’re home

32:35.400 --> 32:39.530
and you are mean or you can be
very mean when you get mad.

32:39.530 --> 32:40.600
And you stay in your room.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.830
- I’m not pissed off.
I felt like a lot of this

32:42.830 --> 32:44.670
last year has been,
like, it’s been hard.

32:44.670 --> 32:47.940
I mean, COVID,
my job has lost so many hours.

32:47.940 --> 32:50.800
I-I feel like a lot of it
has come from,

32:50.800 --> 32:53.140
like, I don’t know,
me feeling--

32:53.140 --> 32:55.400
- Some kinda depression.
- Yeah, kind of depressed.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.440
And like, I feel like I’ve been
at Ashley’s a lot

32:57.440 --> 32:59.670
because, like, they genuinely
are two people that,

32:59.670 --> 33:01.730
like, make me happy
and it’s like--

33:01.730 --> 33:03.730
- Like I totally
understand that.

33:03.730 --> 33:04.900
- But I just feel like
this year

33:04.900 --> 33:08.470
has made me realize, like,
if--if I like--like I have to

33:08.470 --> 33:10.500
change things to be happy,
I have to work for that.

33:10.500 --> 33:14.400
Like, I’m looking for another
job because I’m not happy.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.670
I’m not making enough hours.

33:15.670 --> 33:19.670
I just want to be treated
like an adult.

33:19.670 --> 33:21.530
- All right, well,
I think in that case,

33:21.530 --> 33:23.010
I think if I do something

33:23.010 --> 33:25.070
that makes you not
feel like an adult,

33:25.070 --> 33:27.110
I think you should
bring it up right then

33:27.110 --> 33:29.440
and there so we can
talk about it.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.800
In a lot of ways, you are--are
like--you are an adult,

33:32.800 --> 33:33.860
but there are still some ways

33:33.860 --> 33:37.010
