(serene music playing)

00:58.700 --> 00:59.600
Hi, Blanche.

00:59.667 --> 01:03.333
Girls, you are my very best friends,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.233
and I trust and respect you
more than any people I know,

01:06.300 --> 01:08.600
so tell me the truth.

01:08.667 --> 01:13.433
Now, honestly, do you think
I'm competent at what I do?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.133
Based on the sounds
from your bedroom,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.734
I bet you're damn near spectacular.

01:20.667 --> 01:23.266
I am talking about
my job at the museum.

01:23.333 --> 01:27.834
Of course, you're competent, or they
wouldn't have kept you five years.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.633
Why is my boss constantly
looking over my shoulder?

01:30.700 --> 01:33.967
I'd guess a plunging
neckline and pushup bra.

01:37.066 --> 01:40.734
Sometimes I think
I want to throw in the towel

01:40.800 --> 01:42.734
and take an early retirement.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.367
I wonder if you can collect
social security at 49-50.

01:48.767 --> 01:53.033
49-50. What is that, the address
of the social security building?

01:54.433 --> 01:57.233
You had a bad day at work.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.433
It happens to all of us,
but we're not retiring.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.467
I just don't know
what I'd do if I retired.

02:03.533 --> 02:06.333
No problems to solve,
no challenges.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.133
I'd be afraid my mind
would go soft.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.033
Don't even talk that way, Rose.
That's crazy talk.

02:16.367 --> 02:19.533
It sure would be nice to have
some investments to fall back on.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.000
I just never had
a mind for that.

02:22.066 --> 02:25.066
Me, neither. I never had
a mind for money matters.

02:25.133 --> 02:28.200
I let Stanley handle
all our investments.

02:28.266 --> 02:29.700
Did he have a head for numbers?

02:29.767 --> 02:33.734
Stanley?
He had to get naked to count to 21.

02:41.033 --> 02:43.166
A little more.

02:43.233 --> 02:47.400
If you ask me, we are doing fine
starting out slow,

02:47.467 --> 02:50.633
going in on that certificate
of deposit together.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.800
It's the simplest
form of investment.

02:52.867 --> 02:54.967
An idiot couldn't screw it up.

02:55.033 --> 02:59.000
Rose, what was
the rate today for the CD?

02:59.066 --> 03:00.934
I didn't go to the bank.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.867
I was called in to work early.
I asked Sophia to go.

03:03.934 --> 03:07.800
You let ma leave here
with $3,000 of our money?

03:07.867 --> 03:09.767
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

03:09.834 --> 03:14.033
Odds are she'll probably come back
with a handful of magic beans!

03:15.734 --> 03:17.166
Just relax.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.700
Your mother is a responsible woman.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.266
She knows how long it took us
to save that money.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.667
You can trust her.

03:23.734 --> 03:25.133
Don't get mad.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.367
Ma, did you buy the CD?

03:29.433 --> 03:31.767
Not exactly. Don't get mad.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.834
Sophia, what did you do
with our money?

03:33.900 --> 03:35.967
I think you're going
to be really impressed.

03:36.033 --> 03:38.667
I made a shrewd deal with a guy
I met at the bus stop.

03:41.233 --> 03:44.633
It's a big responsibility
to take care of one,

03:44.700 --> 03:46.266
but I bought a boxer.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.533
You spent $3,000 for a dog?

03:49.600 --> 03:51.734
He's no dog. He's a winner.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.333
Come on in, Pepe.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.467
Ma, you bought a prize fighter?

03:58.533 --> 04:00.734
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
investment.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.166
In a week, you'll kiss
the ground I walk on.

04:03.233 --> 04:07.066
And you'll be looking up at it
from the other side.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.734
What happens a week from tonight?

04:09.800 --> 04:11.433
Pepe, tell them.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.633
<i>-Que?</i>
-Pepe, boom-boom.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.800
Kill Gonzalez!

04:15.867 --> 04:17.367
Attaboy, tiger.

04:17.433 --> 04:21.233
Pepe, why don't you do some
road work while we talk?

04:21.300 --> 04:24.367
<i>-Que?</i>
-Immigration, Pepe! Immigration!

04:27.767 --> 04:29.934
Nobody has to worry
about anything.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.800
This is the chance of a lifetime.

04:31.867 --> 04:33.500
Even if Pepe loses
next week's fight,

04:33.567 --> 04:35.400
he still gets $10,000.

04:35.467 --> 04:36.767
How is that possible?

04:36.834 --> 04:38.133
It's a guaranteed purse.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.867
For our lousy 3 grand investment,
that's a $7,000 profit.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.367
Pepe gets the standard 20%,

04:45.433 --> 04:48.700
and we're left with a tidy sum
for only one week's work.

04:48.767 --> 04:51.233
So 20% is standard for a boxer?

04:51.300 --> 04:54.033
It is if he doesn't speak English.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.633
Ma, that's it. Forget it.
Take him back.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.667
To where, customer service?

05:00.433 --> 05:03.600
I believe there's a no-return clause
on fighters,

05:03.667 --> 05:05.433
unless you're Robin Givens.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.767
This isn't making any sense.

05:09.834 --> 05:11.600
It's all legit. I checked it out.

05:11.667 --> 05:15.200
If you don't mind,
we'll make a few calls of our own

05:15.266 --> 05:17.166
to find out what this is all about.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.000
The whole thing is ridiculous.

05:19.066 --> 05:21.667
Fine. In the meantime,
I'll bunk with you.

05:21.734 --> 05:23.333
I told Pepe he could have my room.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.934
He's staying here with us?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.500
Hey, we're in training,
and set another place at the table.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.266
Hey, Pepe.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.000
Pepe, you like ravioli?

05:33.066 --> 05:34.467
<i>-Que?</i>
-Boom-boom.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.900
Kill Gonzalez!

05:39.300 --> 05:41.934
(calm music playing)

05:47.200 --> 05:49.367
Yeah, his name is Kid Pepe.

05:49.433 --> 05:53.166
He's supposed to have
a fight next week.

05:53.233 --> 05:54.633
Thank you. I'll hold.

05:56.700 --> 06:00.266
Ok, Kid, there are three things
you have to remember in the ring.

06:00.333 --> 06:03.133
One, keep your face covered.
Two, keep your head down.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.166
Three, keep moving at all times.

06:05.233 --> 06:07.467
Incidentally,
the same rules apply

06:07.533 --> 06:10.734
if you're dining in a clam bar
in little Italy.

06:13.867 --> 06:17.700
-(music plays louder)
-Ma, turn that down. I can't hear.

06:17.767 --> 06:20.667
Yes? Yes, yes, I'm still here.

06:20.734 --> 06:24.967
Oh, so the contract is valid?

06:25.033 --> 06:28.100
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.767
Everything's on the up and up.

06:29.834 --> 06:31.433
He does have a fight.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.900
All we have to do
is hire a cut man.

06:33.967 --> 06:35.400
I can probably do that

06:35.467 --> 06:39.700
on my way back
from the dry cleaner's.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.767
It sounds so natural,
doesn't it?

06:42.834 --> 06:46.900
Well, I guess till next Tuesday,
we are Kid Pepe's managers.

06:46.967 --> 06:48.533
What happens after Tuesday?

06:48.600 --> 06:50.500
We take our winnings
and buy a heavyweight.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.934
Ok, a middleweight
and a microwave.

06:58.367 --> 07:01.834
Forget it. This insanity lasts
exactly one week,

07:01.900 --> 07:03.433
and that's only because
we have a chance

07:03.500 --> 07:05.700
of possibly getting
our savings back.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.033
The minute the fight's over,
it's adios, Pepe.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.367
No, no, pepe!

07:11.433 --> 07:12.800
Get back here and boom-boom.

07:12.867 --> 07:16.734
Wouldn't it be something
to make $7,000 in 7 days?

07:16.800 --> 07:18.000
It sure would.

07:18.066 --> 07:20.900
Girls, remember
what we're dealing with.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.934
My mother bought
this man at a bus stop.

07:25.834 --> 07:27.400
Jab, left, jab, jab.

07:27.467 --> 07:30.233
Ma, what are you doing?
You know nothing about boxing.

07:30.300 --> 07:35.166
I used to be known as the don king
of Sicily.

07:35.233 --> 07:37.333
Of course, I wore my hair
differently then.

07:39.266 --> 07:41.333
Maybe I can help Pepe too.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.133
Yeah. You're a constant reminder

07:43.200 --> 07:45.867
of what might happen
if you spar without headgear.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.400
I mean maybe
I can help him with this.

07:50.467 --> 07:53.066
"A" my name is Anna,
my husband's name is Alf.

07:53.133 --> 07:56.100
We come from Anderhueven,
and we sell antlers.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.900
This is ridiculous.

07:57.967 --> 08:00.367
What's important is
that we get our money back.

08:00.433 --> 08:03.033
What's the difference if Pepe wins?

08:03.100 --> 08:05.033
-10 grand.
-Say what?

08:05.100 --> 08:09.000
If Pepe wins, the money's doubled.
Didn't I mention that?

08:09.066 --> 08:12.567
Hands up, Pepe. Bob, weave.
Ma, get the music.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.867
(mellow music playing)

08:19.934 --> 08:23.533
Pussycat, you better get some sleep.
The big fight's tomorrow.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.266
Words that have echoed
from mother to daughter

08:26.333 --> 08:28.266
since time began.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.300
Ok, so I don't turn a phrase
like Harriet Nelson.

08:33.367 --> 08:35.834
You still better get some sleep.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.633
I can't. I'm too nervous.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.600
-About the money?
-No, Ma. I'm always a wreck

08:40.667 --> 08:43.700
the night before any welterweight
division "B" match-up

08:43.767 --> 08:46.000
at the local arena.

08:46.066 --> 08:49.533
Of course, I'm worried about,
how could you do this?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.800
How could you gamble
with our money?

08:53.567 --> 08:55.667
Let me tell you a story.

08:58.033 --> 09:02.800
Picture it, Sicily, 1920.

09:02.867 --> 09:06.567
Two girls pack their bags
and leave their tiny village

09:06.633 --> 09:10.834
to seek fame and fortune.

09:12.333 --> 09:15.400
Their journey takes them
to a seaside town.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.600
A ship prepares to depart
for the new world.

09:18.667 --> 09:22.667
-They're just--
-The new world?

09:22.734 --> 09:24.433
Hey, anybody can say
"Baltimore."

09:24.500 --> 09:26.400
There's an art
to telling these stories.

09:26.467 --> 09:27.934
-Sorry.
-Where was I?

09:28.033 --> 09:31.333
-Departing for the new world.
-Oh, right.

09:31.400 --> 09:37.533
Anyway, the price of steerage
turns out to be 900,000 lira.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.166
Or approximately a buck
and a quarter.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.767
Which is exactly the amount
of each girls' life savings.

09:45.834 --> 09:46.867
Exactly?

09:46.934 --> 09:51.066
That's why this is a story,
not an immigration report.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.200
May I continue?

09:53.800 --> 09:56.367
One girl chooses
to spend her money

09:56.433 --> 09:58.266
and take a chance on adventure.

09:58.333 --> 10:02.500
The other plays it cautiously
and books only a ferry to Sardinia,

10:02.567 --> 10:06.967
saving the rest of her money
for a rainy day.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.467
Let me guess.

10:08.533 --> 10:11.834
You were the one
who chose adventure.

10:11.900 --> 10:16.867
You also would have said Baltimore.
You're no good at this.

10:16.934 --> 10:19.567
I'm the girl who played it safe.

10:19.633 --> 10:20.867
Maybe if I'd made
the other choice,

10:20.934 --> 10:22.500
I would have been
prime minister of Israel

10:22.567 --> 10:24.967
instead of my good friend
Golda Meir.

10:34.367 --> 10:38.100
Ma, you never met Golda Meir.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.633
Please,
I almost married her husband.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.700
The man who perfected
the hot dog.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.800
Oscar Mayer.

10:47.367 --> 10:49.967
You're not making any sense.

10:50.033 --> 10:53.100
Let me level with you.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.133
All my life I've been practical.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.867
Your father was the dreamer.

10:56.934 --> 11:02.533
So when this opportunity came,
I could hear his voice.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.734
"Sophia, take a chance.
Go for it."

11:05.800 --> 11:08.600
I didn't mean to hurt you.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.400
I did it for your father.

11:12.934 --> 11:14.800
Oh, Ma.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.700
That's a load of crap.

11:21.767 --> 11:24.033
I'm dancing as fast as I can.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.000
I did a dumb thing.
What else do you want me to say?

11:27.066 --> 11:28.967
At least it was a start.

11:29.033 --> 11:32.867
Tell me again how everything
is going to work out just fine.

11:32.934 --> 11:34.867
Everything is gonna
work out just fine.

11:34.934 --> 11:37.800
All the Kid has to do
is step into that ring,

11:37.867 --> 11:39.166
and we'll make our money back.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.467
Oh, Dorothy, he's gone!

11:41.533 --> 11:42.767
-What?
-Pepe's gone!

11:42.834 --> 11:44.333
I went to take him
milk and cookies,

11:44.400 --> 11:45.567
and his room
is empty.

11:45.633 --> 11:49.834
He can't be gone!
We have to find him!

11:49.900 --> 11:51.533
Sophia, where are you going?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.166
Out the window
before I'm thrown out.

11:53.233 --> 11:55.333
On my own, I can tuck and roll.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.300
(nostalgic music playing)

12:03.934 --> 12:05.800
Are you sure
this is the right place?

12:05.867 --> 12:08.934
It was the only address
we could find in Pepe's room.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.867
I still feel uncomfortable about
going through Pepe's things.

12:11.934 --> 12:15.266
Me too, although it was exciting
opening his closet

12:15.333 --> 12:17.567
and seeing his little boxing trunks

12:17.633 --> 12:21.166
with that provocative
nickname on them.

12:21.233 --> 12:25.000
Blanche, Everlast is a brand name,
not a nickname.

12:30.867 --> 12:33.400
What kind of a place is this anyway?

12:33.467 --> 12:36.367
An old office building
or a warehouse.

12:36.433 --> 12:39.400
Looks like a place
where shady dealings go on.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.367
Let's forget our money
and save our behinds.

12:42.433 --> 12:45.834
Why? You've got a lot more
behind than you do money.

12:45.900 --> 12:49.467
No. I'm with you. Let's cut
our losses and get out of here.

12:49.533 --> 12:53.300
(piano and violin duet plays)

13:21.066 --> 13:23.467
Excuse me.
This is a private session.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.333
What is going on here?

13:25.400 --> 13:26.600
What does it look like?

13:26.667 --> 13:29.867
The opposition kidnapped our fighter
and is turning him into a sissy boy

13:29.934 --> 13:31.633
by making him play the violin.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.800
-Come on, Pepe.
-Ma!

13:34.867 --> 13:37.133
I guess
I've got some explaining to do.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.300
You sure do,
like why you snuck out on us,

13:40.367 --> 13:42.633
like why you used us,

13:42.700 --> 13:47.300
like why you're speaking better
English than Sylvester Stallone.

13:48.867 --> 13:51.033
Pepe, what is this all about?

13:51.100 --> 13:53.767
The violin.
In two days, I'm auditioning

13:53.834 --> 13:55.200
for the Juilliard school of music.

13:55.266 --> 13:58.166
Yeah, right, and
I'm Jimmy Swaggart's favorite way

13:58.233 --> 14:00.200
to pass a lonely afternoon.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.667
It's true. This is my teacher.

14:04.734 --> 14:06.433
He's been coaching me
in the evenings.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.900
I see,

14:07.967 --> 14:10.900
and is there anything else
that you feel we're entitled to know

14:10.967 --> 14:14.233
before we kiss you
and the $3,000 goodbye?

14:14.300 --> 14:15.667
You'll get your money back.

14:15.734 --> 14:17.467
I'm going to fight tomorrow.

14:17.533 --> 14:19.867
I'll need that purse
if Juilliard accepts me.

14:19.934 --> 14:22.533
You need a purse to go to Juilliard?

14:25.567 --> 14:27.600
You understood more
when he spoke Spanish,

14:27.667 --> 14:30.000
didn't you, Rose?

14:30.066 --> 14:33.367
Well, frankly,
I don't understand much, either.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.166
Pepe, why didn't you tell us
all this

14:35.233 --> 14:37.000
when Sophia first
brought you home?

14:37.066 --> 14:39.000
I was afraid you'd back out.

14:39.066 --> 14:41.600
I needed you to pay
the fight's entrance fee.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.066
Entrance fee?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.467
Oh, yeah, right.
Didn't I mention that?

14:45.533 --> 14:48.967
No problem.
It comes out of Rose's share.

14:49.033 --> 14:52.533
Why did you pretend
to only know Spanish?

14:52.600 --> 14:55.467
It's part of the image, Cuban boxers
know their right from their left,

14:55.533 --> 14:56.233
not much else.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.900
And you think that we are that
narrow-minded and prejudiced

14:59.967 --> 15:01.800
that we felt that way?

15:01.867 --> 15:03.266
You bought into it, didn't you?

15:04.467 --> 15:06.200
Hey, I didn't invent Kid Pepe.

15:06.266 --> 15:09.567
I just conformed to your image
of a simpleminded Hispanic fighter.

15:09.633 --> 15:14.533
Well, I am a Cuban,
but Hath not a Cuban eyes?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.500
Hath not a Cuban hands,

15:16.567 --> 15:21.934
organs, dimensions, senses,
affections, passions?

15:21.967 --> 15:24.967
Fed with the same food,

15:25.033 --> 15:27.900
hurt with the same weapons,

15:27.967 --> 15:30.166
subject to the same diseases,

15:30.233 --> 15:32.967
healed by the same means,

15:33.033 --> 15:38.000
warmed and cooled by the same winter
and summer as you are?

15:38.066 --> 15:40.767
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

15:40.834 --> 15:44.867
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

15:44.934 --> 15:48.600
If you poison us, do we not die?

15:48.667 --> 15:50.667
I also considered auditioning for
the actor's studio.

15:55.233 --> 15:57.834
Why does every fighter
become an actor?

15:57.900 --> 16:00.200
Just once I'd like it
the other way around

16:00.266 --> 16:04.600
if for no other reason than to see
Chevy Chase get his butt kicked.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.867
You can't take a chance like that!

16:08.934 --> 16:10.834
I need the money for school.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.233
What about your hands?

16:12.300 --> 16:15.633
-What if something happens to them?
-They'll be fine.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.467
After tomorrow,
I'll never fight again.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.066
Or never play the violin again.

16:19.133 --> 16:22.066
Excuse me.
Are we back to real life,

16:22.133 --> 16:26.100
or are the two of you performing
a scene from <i>Golden Boy?</i>

16:26.166 --> 16:28.567
Ladies, I've spent years
working with this boy,

16:28.633 --> 16:31.066
watching him turn into
a masterful musician.

16:31.133 --> 16:34.133
You yourselves have heard
how he makes the violin sing,

16:34.200 --> 16:36.166
but his fate is in your hands.

16:36.233 --> 16:39.667
Please don't make him
step into that ring.

16:39.734 --> 16:41.734
And lose all our money?

16:41.800 --> 16:42.767
Yes.

16:42.834 --> 16:46.500
That's the most touching thing
I've ever heard.

16:46.567 --> 16:47.967
I don't know what to say.

16:48.033 --> 16:49.834
I do.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.767
Fat chance, grandpa!

16:56.066 --> 16:59.467
(serene music playing)

16:59.533 --> 17:02.467
Oh, no.
What's everybody doing up?

17:02.533 --> 17:03.967
We settled this.

17:04.033 --> 17:05.400
The Kid wants to fight.

17:05.467 --> 17:06.800
We need him to fight.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.200
There's no problem here.

17:08.266 --> 17:11.133
-Everybody back to bed.
-Ma, stop that.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.500
Look, we have to
consider this carefully.

17:13.567 --> 17:16.900
We could be holding
the man's fate in our hands.

17:16.967 --> 17:19.467
I once held a man's fate
in my hands.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.467
I'm shocked.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.767
It was back in high school.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.967
I was dating the quarterback of
the football team.

17:31.033 --> 17:33.600
Every major college was trying
to recruit him.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.700
I was sure he was leaning
toward Notre Dame,

17:36.767 --> 17:39.633
'cause he asked me
how to spell it.

17:41.567 --> 17:44.266
But secretly,
I was hoping for Alabama.

17:44.333 --> 17:48.533
Going to Notre Dame would put
such a wrench in our relationship,

17:48.600 --> 17:52.400
with all those priests
skulking about the campus.

17:52.467 --> 17:56.500
Anyway, one night he told me
he'd finally made his decision,

17:56.567 --> 17:58.767
he was going to enroll
at the Junior College

17:58.834 --> 18:00.400
5 miles outside of town.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.300
When I said, "Honey, why?

18:02.367 --> 18:04.967
They don't have a football team,"

18:05.033 --> 18:08.867
he answered by slipping a ring on
my finger and proposing marriage.

18:08.934 --> 18:11.800
Well... I could not believe it.

18:11.867 --> 18:14.266
I just sat there
for almost half an hour,

18:14.333 --> 18:16.667
just staring at that ring.

18:16.734 --> 18:19.867
Finally, I said,
"Honey, this will not do.

18:19.934 --> 18:21.800
I cannot accept this ring."

18:21.867 --> 18:25.300
Because you loved him so much, you
didn't want to hamper his career.

18:25.367 --> 18:27.300
No, because it was
a piece of cheap glass

18:27.367 --> 18:30.900
and the band was turning
my finger green!

18:32.533 --> 18:34.867
No matter what your reasons were,

18:34.934 --> 18:36.600
you obviously made
the right decision.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.967
He probably went on
to a very successful career.

18:40.033 --> 18:42.567
Actually, he was so crushed
by my rejection

18:42.633 --> 18:45.400
that he gave up football
and turned gay.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.533
Blanche, you don't turn gay.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.266
You're either gay, or you're not.
You had nothing to do with it.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.033
Dorothy, if he'd been gay before,

18:57.100 --> 18:59.633
he would've had better taste
in jewelry.

19:03.867 --> 19:04.834
That sure convinced me.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.767
Let's get some shuteye.
It's almost fight time.

19:06.834 --> 19:07.700
Ma!

19:07.767 --> 19:09.667
I'm not asking him to win.

19:09.734 --> 19:11.934
He only has to step in the ring.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.233
If he does that,
he might hurt his hands.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.333
Unless he's so bad,
he gets knocked out

19:18.400 --> 19:21.333
before he can even throw a punch.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.934
Is everybody thinking
what I'm thinking?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.900
That that was a really
mean thing to say.

19:31.700 --> 19:35.834
As a general rule, Rose, you should
not be the first to answer.

19:41.300 --> 19:46.200
If we convince Pepe just to show up
and get knocked out,

19:46.266 --> 19:48.066
everybody will get what they want.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.266
What if he won't do that?

19:50.333 --> 19:51.667
We'll talk him into it.

19:51.734 --> 19:53.934
There's no shame in taking a dive.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
In Sicily,
it's a time-honored tradition.

19:59.367 --> 20:02.900
(calm music playing)

20:04.633 --> 20:07.100
Pepe, could we
have a word with you?

20:07.166 --> 20:08.600
There's something
we'd like to discuss.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.200
Later. I've got things on my mind.

20:11.266 --> 20:14.867
Like that big sucker
over in the other corner?

20:14.934 --> 20:17.000
That's at the top of the list.

20:17.066 --> 20:20.066
We want to talk about strategy.
We have an idea.

20:20.133 --> 20:21.900
Oh, yeah? What should I do?

20:21.967 --> 20:23.133
Fall down.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.033
-What?
-Take a dive.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.467
Ma! It wouldn't be a dive exactly.

20:28.533 --> 20:31.066
Just protect your hands
by not using them.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.066
If you get knocked out, it's ok.

20:33.133 --> 20:34.767
I can't do that. It's immoral.

20:34.834 --> 20:38.867
What's so moral about two guys
standing in the ring,

20:38.934 --> 20:40.367
beating each other bloody?

20:40.433 --> 20:41.367
It's unfair!

20:41.433 --> 20:43.166
To whom, the gamblers?

20:43.233 --> 20:45.900
Gambling is illegal in this state.

20:45.967 --> 20:47.200
Besides, you're such an underdog,

20:47.266 --> 20:50.200
even Benny the Weasel
won't give odds.

20:50.266 --> 20:53.567
I overheard that at Bingo
the other night.

20:53.633 --> 20:55.967
This way, everybody wins,
and nobody gets hurt.

20:56.033 --> 20:59.166
What's wrong with that?

20:59.233 --> 21:00.100
All right. I'll do it.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.367
-Oh!
-Great!

21:01.433 --> 21:03.767
Hey, Pepe!
Your mother's a tramp!

21:03.834 --> 21:05.200
I'll kill you, Gonzales.

21:05.266 --> 21:06.867
(bell rings)

21:11.100 --> 21:13.133
It's a good thing
he doesn't play trumpet.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.000
His lip looks like meat loaf.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.033
-Just relax. Don't be nervous.
-I'm not nervous.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.066
-Are your hands all right?
-They're fine.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.533
He never threw a punch.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.266
That's all behind you now.
This is the moment you wanted.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.667
Good luck.

21:38.834 --> 21:43.200
Before I start this piece,
I just have one question to ask...

21:44.667 --> 21:48.967
-do I play the violin?
-Oh, no.

21:49.033 --> 21:52.500
I can't remember the piece
I'm supposed to play.

21:52.567 --> 21:55.667
This happens sometimes
after a fight.

21:55.734 --> 21:56.767
Can I come back tomorrow?

21:56.834 --> 22:00.100
I'm afraid not. You won't
be eligible until next year.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.233
I can't believe I blew it.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.800
Pepe, it's not your fault.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.200
They are not going
to give you another chance

22:07.266 --> 22:10.233
-because you're Cuban.
-Huh?

22:10.734 --> 22:14.200
-Because you're Cuban.
-Because you're Cuban.

22:15.467 --> 22:16.800
Oh...

22:18.266 --> 22:20.500
because I'm Cuban.

22:22.567 --> 22:25.834
But Hath not a Cuban eyes?

22:25.900 --> 22:28.400
Hath not a Cuban hands,

22:28.467 --> 22:34.834
organs, dimensions, senses,
affections, passions?

22:34.900 --> 22:37.166
Fed with the same food,

22:37.233 --> 22:39.233
hurt with the same weapons...

22:40.867 --> 22:46.100
subject to the same diseases,
healed by the same means,

22:46.166 --> 22:50.700
warmed and cooled by the same winter
and summer as you are.

22:51.867 --> 22:55.000
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

22:55.066 --> 22:58.567
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

22:58.633 --> 23:01.767
If you poison us, do we not die?

23:05.400 --> 23:08.333
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!

23:08.400 --> 23:11.000
That was the finest audition
for the acting school

23:11.066 --> 23:13.800
that we've seen all week.
Congratulations.

23:13.867 --> 23:18.033
I'm so glad Pepe has the opportunity
to be an actor.

23:18.100 --> 23:22.367
Why? When was the last time
you saw a Cuban Macbeth?

23:22.433 --> 23:24.633
He'll finish school
and spend his whole career

23:24.700 --> 23:28.200
getting arrested on TV cop shows.

23:28.266 --> 23:30.934
You don't see the bright side
of anything, do you?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.800
No, but I can fake a smile.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.500
-Congratulations, Pepe.
-I'm so happy for you.

23:45.066 --> 23:48.367
(theme music playing)
