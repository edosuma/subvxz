actually flooded it.

was his weekly painting class.

like something

09:55.362 --> 09:57.629
Or someone had him
in a bad mood?

09:57.631 --> 09:58.797
It was his day
to pick the music,

09:58.799 --> 09:59.831
And he chose haydn.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.112
I like to back up my data
every 15 minutes,

sparred last week?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.345
No, as usual,

Why would he do that?
Why would he lie to me?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.678
Maybe it's connected
to his bad mood.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.379
My husband
does not lie to me.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.148

And that put you
in a bad mood?

16:52.278 --> 16:54.779
If I did that, I would literally
write a song about myself.

16:54.781 --> 16:55.780
It would be like...

16:55.782 --> 16:57.448
♪ jake the hero ♪

16:57.450 --> 16:58.683
♪ abs of steel ♪

16:58.685 --> 17:00.218
♪ sha-la, la-la ♪

17:00.220 --> 17:01.586
Why would you
keep this from me,

17:01.588 --> 17:03.388
And why would you lie
about going to fencing?

17:03.390 --> 17:06.691
Because he couldn't go,
because he's injured.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.760
I wasn't injured.
I was lightly stabbed.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.194
I'm sorry.
You were stabbed?

17:11.196 --> 17:14.531
Lightly stabbed.
I didn't want to frighten you.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.733
You are my husband.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.535
I want you
to tell me everything,

17:17.537 --> 17:19.270
Especially things
that might frighten me.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.271
How can you not
know that?

17:20.272 --> 17:23.608
Raymond,
you are unbelievable.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.080
Hey, captain,
you look so tall.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.649
What you have done
is beyond unprofessional.

17:31.651 --> 17:35.119
You cannot muck around
in people's private lives.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.822
Get out of my house.

17:37.824 --> 17:41.726
But get into your car?
I'll go.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.668
Sir.
Detective.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.504
So how was your night?
Of work.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.839
I'm not asking
about your personal life.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.407
I don't care
about you personally.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.676
I mean, I'm neutral.
I mean, who are you?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.446
Floundering
is worse than silence.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.381
Oh, cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.616
Cool, cool, no doubt.
No doubt, no doubt.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.418
[clicks tongue]

18:07.420 --> 18:09.353
Man, this elevator's slow,
huh?

18:09.355 --> 18:11.389
That's because you haven't
pressed the button.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.826
That's why
you're the captain.

18:14.828 --> 18:15.827
[chuckles]

18:15.829 --> 18:17.128
So smart.

18:17.130 --> 18:21.232
I'm gonna just--
zip.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.367
No more talk-y.
Hmm.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.669
[elevator dings]

18:30.375 --> 18:33.678
Eek, blast of cold air
coming out of that box.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.246
Name of amy's sex tape.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.281
Hey, man, come on.
Not cool.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.617
I'm going through something.
Just let me have this one.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.686
I'm sorry you wasted
your chit, jake.

18:41.688 --> 18:42.854
It's all right.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.856
I want to apologize to holt,
but it seems personal,

18:44.858 --> 18:46.557
And I'm not supposed to talk
to him about personal stuff.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.760
Oh, boo, I guess you need to
think of some professional way

18:49.762 --> 18:51.129
To make it up to him.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.631
Wait a minute.
Gina, that's it.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.566
I just had an idea.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.402
[as holt]
peralta, you're a genius.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.770
Who was that, scarjo?

18:59.772 --> 19:01.572
It was holt,
and I think you know that.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.741
I thought
it was scarjo.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.345
I can't believe
that bastard beat me.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.781
It's kind of hard to see
how he's the winner in this.

19:10.783 --> 19:11.916
He made me
look like an idiot.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.351
No, amy and I
were the idiots,

19:13.353 --> 19:15.853
Because we let
that ancient windbag fool us.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.421
He robbed the banks.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.290
He gave me money
for the ginger ale.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.925
After you insisted
he was guilty,

19:20.927 --> 19:22.693
I went back
and checked his dollar.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.829
Serial numbers
match the stolen bills.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.697
<i>(rosa)</i>
<i>you brought in</i>
<i>the right guy.</i>

19:26.699 --> 19:27.899
You're a damn good cop, boyle.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.567
I know.
No one listens.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.469
Except when you threw water
in his dead face.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.503
That was rough.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.704
I thought
he was faking it.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.407
I wanted to splash
the lies out of him.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.512
All right, detective,
what's this all about?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.714
You have 70 seconds.
Why 70?

19:43.716 --> 19:45.249
Do you really want
to waste your time

19:45.251 --> 19:46.417
While I explain
my algorithm?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.752
Right, all right,
so I pulled a still

19:47.754 --> 19:49.587
From the security footage
of your attempted mugging

19:49.589 --> 19:50.922
And sent it
to the nearby precincts.

19:50.924 --> 19:53.958
We id'd one of the mopes,
and that's his apartment.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.194
I thought maybe you would
want to do the honors.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.429
And you think this will make
everything you did better?

19:58.431 --> 20:01.432
Well, maybe.
It was gina's idea, so--

20:01.434 --> 20:04.702
It will.
Gina had nothing
to do with it.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.871
You want to know why
I was so angry all week?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.239
When those men came at me,

20:08.241 --> 20:10.208
I acted like
I was a 20-year-old.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.311
I took a stupid risk,
and I got myself stabbed.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.579
I was in pain

20:14.581 --> 20:17.815
And frustrated about lying
to the man I love.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.850
Kevin.
Yes.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.719
Obviously kevin.
Obviously.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.289
What I'm trying to say is,
you were right all along.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.290
I wasn't mad at you.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.291
I was mad at myself,

20:27.293 --> 20:30.995
And I took it out
on the squad.

20:30.997 --> 20:34.365
Peralta,
you're a genius.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.268
Oh, my god.
You said it.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.603
I heard you practicing
in the men's room.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.937
Yeah, that makes
more sense.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.406
Attention, squad,
quick announcement.

20:42.408 --> 20:46.510
And you are each allowed
two personal photographs,

20:46.512 --> 20:48.446
Two trinkets,
and three assorted knickknacks.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.547
<i>You know what?</i>

20:49.549 --> 20:50.982
Just follow
sergeant jeffords' lead.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.351
He always knows how to keep
this place running smoothly.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.786
Nice, so rubber band balls
are back.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.622
Oh, no, it's bad
for the bands.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.690
Ah, kevin.
Let me just get my coat.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.526
Hello, peralta.
Gina.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.496
Oh, sweet lords of dance,
thank you.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.465
We're back
on a first-name basis.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.001
Kevin, I am unable
and unwilling

21:10.003 --> 21:11.602
To discuss personal matters
with you.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.004
I'm aware of that, yes.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.572
In any case,
thank you for you help.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.575
I brought you both gifts:
Original raymond holts.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.776
[gina gasps]

21:18.778 --> 21:20.411
I will treasure
this painting of a rock

21:21.648 --> 21:24.715

<i>ah,</i> rock 59 <i> and</i> 367.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.488

21:32.457 --> 21:34.492

Shh.
