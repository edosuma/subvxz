01:39:45.724 --> 01:39:47.525
Oh, welcome to the family.

01:39:47.527 --> 01:39:50.595
Well done, well done,
both of you.

01:39:50.597 --> 01:39:52.562
Sorry I doubted you,
Mr. President.

01:39:52.564 --> 01:39:55.566
Yeah, well,
you were wrong, Jake, again.

01:39:55.568 --> 01:39:58.035
Well, how many times
do I have to tell you?

01:39:58.037 --> 01:39:59.205
Never listen to me.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:09.681
God, it's good
to have you back, man.

01:40:09.683 --> 01:40:11.018
Good to be back.

01:40:36.742 --> 01:40:38.978
<font color="#FD2222">MAX :</font> It's a nice place
you got here, Jake.

01:40:39.612 --> 01:40:40.880
<font color="#FD2222">JAKE :</font> Thank you.

01:40:41.915 --> 01:40:44.082
So when you heading back up?

01:40:44.084 --> 01:40:46.449
- <font color="#00CB44">(SIGHS)</font> In a week.
- Yeah?

01:40:46.451 --> 01:40:48.488
Yeah, a lot of work left.

01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:51.124
But I'll be back.

01:40:52.992 --> 01:40:54.193
I know.

01:41:04.036 --> 01:41:05.002
This sucks.

01:41:05.004 --> 01:41:06.503
Yeah, seriously,
this is so boring.

01:41:06.505 --> 01:41:08.206
You know what? I can't do this
for another second.

01:41:08.208 --> 01:41:10.041
Now, why'd you make us do this
in the first place?

01:41:10.043 --> 01:41:12.010
I don't know. I was trying
to relive a moment.

01:41:12.012 --> 01:41:13.910
<font color="#FD2222">MAX :</font> A moment? What moment?

01:41:13.912 --> 01:41:15.378
We never went fishing
with Dad.

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:16.814
<i>You made that whole story up.</i>

01:41:16.816 --> 01:41:18.682
<font color="#FD2222">JAKE :</font> Yeah, but that was
a good story, though, huh?

01:41:18.684 --> 01:41:20.484
I mean,
you gotta give me that.

01:41:20.486 --> 01:41:21.953
I mean, it had a moral
and everything.

01:41:21.955 --> 01:41:24.124
<font color="#FD2222">MAX :</font> <font color="#00CB44">(LAUGHS)</font> Moral?
What moral?
