l'd credit you with a save
in the box score of life.

it was the best writing
l've done all year.

And he's right, it was.
A little long, maybe.

21:18.521 --> 21:19.476
Bedecker, l owe you.

21:19.589 --> 21:21.454
No, no, you left
great notes.

a proposition for you.

You see, Mr. Bedecker,

truth is, l'm tired.

As you may have noticed,
l tend to indulge my
weaknesses to the extreme.

21:47.050 --> 21:50.156
What l need is
some time to dry out,
to get my head clear.

21:50.553 --> 21:51.815
You could give me
that time.

21:51.921 --> 21:52.910

minute l saw you out
there on that field,

22:54.050 --> 22:55.711

l told Devlin, too.

how about, say, a couple

you're getting paid for?

23:49.472 --> 23:51.895
Hey, listen, have you
seen Joe around?

23:55.445 --> 23:58.471
l just remembered
one of the reasons
l drink.

23:58.581 --> 24:00.970
Forgive the truisms
of a tired old hack,

24:01.084 --> 24:03.746

reasons is to forget.

l also owe him some favors
and he came to collect.

l tried to refuse,
but that man can be
very persuasive.

He wanted me
to get him
access to the kid.

24:15.698 --> 24:18.485
l didn't know
what to do, so l went
out and got drunk.

24:18.601 --> 24:20.831
Got drunk, got you
involved, and left
that kid wide open,

for the slaughter.

When those
big brown eyes

33:57.379 --> 33:59.768
gleamed with
desperation and hunger.

34:00.716 --> 34:04.140
When you begged
and pleaded for
what l could offer you.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.034
l saved your soul, honey.

34:11.494 --> 34:13.199
l sold you my soul.

34:14.429 --> 34:15.772
Where's the kid?

34:20.803 --> 34:22.509
He wanted you
to have this.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.422
Where did he go?
Miami.

34:27.810 --> 34:29.072
Cotton Labs.
He said Cotton Labs.

34:29.178 --> 34:30.327
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?
Are you crazy?

34:30.446 --> 34:32.311
You got a game
to pitch later.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.973
lt don't matter none.
l got to tell him
l'm sorry.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.710
You leave now,
you're gonna blow
your whole career.

34:36.819 --> 34:40.208
The General Manager's
gonna be there.
Now don't be stupid, Joe.

34:41.190 --> 34:43.135
l've been stupid.

35:00.776 --> 35:03.438
All right,
l write him off.

35:04.346 --> 35:05.654
l write you off.

35:06.348 --> 35:09.693
Let him pay for
your condo
and your furs.

35:10.686 --> 35:13.393
l learned
a long time ago
to cut my losses.

35:14.924 --> 35:18.428
lf Joe Dunning
doesn't pitch in the
intra-squad game later,

35:18.527 --> 35:20.267
one of my boys will.

35:21.964 --> 35:23.909
So you go to your
little hayseed,

35:25.601 --> 35:29.310
but you tell him
if he shows up anywhere
around Rooster Park,

35:29.405 --> 35:30.906
he's gonna regret it.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.987
Speaking of regrets.

35:35.511 --> 35:38.218
l'm really sorry
that things
turned out this way.

35:39.215 --> 35:42.287
But l guess to ask
a leopard to change
her spots is

35:43.018 --> 35:44.440
indeed impossible.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.266
l'll see you around.

36:11.714 --> 36:14.615
Where is that kid?
He's gonna blow it.

36:20.489 --> 36:22.150
How's it going, Charley?

36:23.259 --> 36:26.285
l tell you, Wordsman,
l hate the modern
day ballplayer.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.813
They don't have
the hustle, the drive
that you and me had.

36:29.898 --> 36:33.208
lt's an hour before game
time, the kid ought to
be here warming up.

36:33.302 --> 36:36.965
The General Manager's
here. Made a special trip
down here to see him.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.505
l don't understand
these kids.

36:39.975 --> 36:43.399
He's probably someplace
blow drying his hair
so he'll look good.

36:43.746 --> 36:45.213
Give me a break.

36:45.447 --> 36:47.267
What are you gonna do
if he doesn't show up?

36:47.383 --> 36:49.772
There's nothing l can do.
Start one of the rookies.

36:49.885 --> 36:52.274
Today's the day
l got a firm
up my roster.

36:53.222 --> 36:54.723
l tell you, Wordsman,

36:55.190 --> 36:57.181
l sure hope
that kid shows up.

37:19.948 --> 37:23.258
l'd like to enjoy
a nice, quiet ballgame.

l came out here to
tell you l was sorry
for what l did.

38:06.829 --> 38:10.731
Sorry for being such a
dumb, stupid kid who doesn't
know what a friend is.

38:12.301 --> 38:13.643
l wanna apologize.

38:14.837 --> 38:15.792
Accepted.

came over me that
took everything away

38:19.842 --> 38:21.912

right and wrong.

38:23.445 --> 38:24.673
You know what l mean?

38:24.780 --> 38:27.726
lt was like
it wasn't me who was
doing it, but it was.

38:30.052 --> 38:31.553
l can't explain it.

38:31.887 --> 38:34.037
And that green thing.
Did you see it?

38:35.257 --> 38:37.600
You have a game
to pitch,
don't you, Joe?

38:39.461 --> 38:41.122
l'm taking you to Miami.

38:41.296 --> 38:44.527
No, l suggest you get
in this car and turn
around and get back there.

This is a big chance
for you, you're gonna
knock 'em dead.

to be there, too.

38:50.706 --> 38:53.732
