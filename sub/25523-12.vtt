WEBVTT

00:17.851 --> 00:20.937
Now, I have to make sure
they remember me forever.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.096
Keep going straight! Keep going straight!

01:28.838 --> 01:31.090
Don't let them come through.
Don't let them come through!

02:27.856 --> 02:29.566
Sir, it's Mr. Ismael.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.197
Dude, now I'm getting out of here!

02:36.573 --> 02:37.907
I'm on the boat.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.284
Joaquin...

02:39.951 --> 02:41.786
I just got information that the DEA

02:41.870 --> 02:44.455
contacted governments
in Guatemala, Nicaragua

02:44.539 --> 02:46.457
and the coastal countries
in South America.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.626
They're waiting for you at the ports.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.880
Is the information trustworthy?

02:52.505 --> 02:55.341
Yes, take precautions.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.260
You have to hide very well.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.348
Stop, stop, stop!

03:06.102 --> 03:07.228
Everything all right, sir?

03:10.356 --> 03:11.357
We're staying.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.943
Mr. Joaquin, we're almost out.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.362
It will be too risky if we stay in Mexico.

03:19.198 --> 03:22.368
In Colombia, or in any other place
I'll be a fugitive just like here, Chilo.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.165
I have to take care of it from the source.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.187
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

03:49.771 --> 03:53.942
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

03:54.234 --> 03:58.404
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:58.821 --> 04:03.952
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

04:05.411 --> 04:08.456
Even when the clouds drift away

04:09.749 --> 04:12.919
Even when my skin dries away

04:13.795 --> 04:17.423
I'll be back someday

04:18.508 --> 04:22.595
To unleash my return

04:27.100 --> 04:30.561
I have the dust that protects the road

04:31.229 --> 04:35.483
I have the branches of a leafless tree

04:35.984 --> 04:39.737
I'm the guardian of the tired night

04:40.280 --> 04:45.451
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

04:46.786 --> 04:50.081
Even when the clouds drift away

04:51.165 --> 04:54.502
Even when my skin dries away

04:55.295 --> 04:58.840
I'll be back someday

05:00.091 --> 05:03.428
To unleash my return

05:07.140 --> 05:10.351
We don't know anything about him
since the confrontation in Puerto La Cruz.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.314
The DEA informs us there's no evidence
he's arrived in Colombia

05:14.647 --> 05:16.399
or any other coastal countries.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.443
It's been several weeks.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.403
He can't disappear just like that.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.822
There's rumors that

05:22.905 --> 05:24.824
he could have been murdered
by Isidoro's people.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.201
Rumors are useless to me, General.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.953
We have to find him.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.581
In Mexico or wherever the fuck he is.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.061
To the house.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.500
Why'd you take this road, Roberto?

06:20.379 --> 06:21.672
I said I'm going home.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.510
I'm sorry, sir.
My family has been kidnapped.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.847
Give me your cell phone, sir.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.307
Don't make things more complicated.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.043
Did you miss me, Conrado?

07:00.962 --> 07:03.422
You wanted to catch me so badly
that I ended up catching you.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.383
Kidnapping me is
the worst thing you could do.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.678
They won't add years
to your sentence for escaping,

07:08.761 --> 07:11.431
but you won't have enough years
to pay your sentence for this.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.266
What kidnapping, Mr. Secretary?

07:13.933 --> 07:15.226
You're officially at lunch.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.728
That's the story

07:17.812 --> 07:20.773
your driver and your bodyguard will tell.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.483
Did you forget your family is outside?

07:23.943 --> 07:24.819
Vulnerable.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.280
Think carefully about
what you want to do.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.034
You won't achieve anything
by threatening me.

07:33.035 --> 07:33.995
Negotiating...

07:34.871 --> 07:36.747
that's how we both move forward,
as always.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.374
Tell me what you want.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.544
I want you to catch me.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.046
But dead.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.759
You want to fake your death?

07:49.760 --> 07:51.262
It's the same for you whether
I'm dead or alive.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.266
The important thing is
that you have your medal

07:55.766 --> 07:57.059
by defeating me.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.106
Be the one that put an end to
"El Chapo" Guzman.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.819
In the end,
that's what will get you the presidency.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.573
Instead of chasing me, you should be
preparing your campaign, Conrado.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.326
The elections are near.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.912
You prepare to be president...

08:16.621 --> 08:18.998
and I prepare the perfect alibi
for my death.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.375
If you die, you have to disappear.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.337
You can't make anymore messes.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.671
I know.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.508
The years are catching up to me.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.637
I just want to be with my family.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.559
Your death can't raise any doubts.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.189
It has to be believable.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.691
We need a Chapo to take your place.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.901
I'll take care of that.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.530
One more thing before I release you.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.491
Don't even think about betraying me.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.203
If you try to catch me
or actually kill me...

08:58.663 --> 09:00.289
just like I got to you right now,

09:00.373 --> 09:02.583
my people will get to you,
and that's the end for you.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.753
You're alive because this is
a win-win situation for both of us.

09:06.045 --> 09:06.963
Nothing more.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.387
RANCH SAFE HOUSE
COSALA, MEXICO

09:16.889 --> 09:20.059
We operated on his cheekbones,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.144
eyebrows and chin.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.692
You look just like me.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.652
Did Chilo tell you about the money?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.320
Yes, Mr. Joaquin, thank you.

09:31.904 --> 09:35.074
You'll be all around Mexico to confuse
the people following me.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.953
You'll always have bodyguards.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.331
-Questions?
-No, sir.

09:42.915 --> 09:43.916
OK, good.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.210
Good luck.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.006
Your sleeve, please.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.096
You know what you have to do.

10:48.981 --> 10:49.982
Hello?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.025
The boss says

10:51.150 --> 10:53.819
that our man is on his way to
the Golden Triangle mountain range.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.656
I'll give you the exact coordinates
where you can find him.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.201
Twenty-five, thirty-four, seventy-seven,

11:00.326 --> 11:01.952
minus 105...

11:05.122 --> 11:08.167
SECURITY CABIN
GOLDEN TRIANGLE, MEXICO

11:36.028 --> 11:39.365
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
MEXICO CITY

11:44.703 --> 11:45.538
We have him.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.418
Follow my instructions to the T.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.044
We got him in a routine inspection
in western Sierra Madre.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.340
We'll release the official statement
in a couple of hours.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.469
Did you get the samples for the DNA tests?

12:41.594 --> 12:42.428
Yes.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.805
They'll send them in a moment.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.979
An army helicopter will pick
him up in half an hour.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.489
Is it clear what you have to do with this?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.784
Give it to them for the DNA sample.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.870
The money will arrive at your house.
Where's the body?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.178
Come on, come on!

14:58.314 --> 14:59.607
MEXICO CITY

14:59.690 --> 15:02.735
On the same night, Mexico
received two shocking news reports:

15:02.985 --> 15:07.156
the death of the Sinaloa cartel fugitive
leader, Joaquin El Chapo Guzman,

15:07.239 --> 15:11.577
and following, the theft of his body
by the members of his organization.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.122
We are as surprised as you are, Director.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.833
We never thought they would take him.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.964
I disagree. If it's not enough
with the pictures,

15:24.506 --> 15:27.635
the DNA tests will be enough
to confirm it was Guzman.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.015
Those accusations are too severe

15:33.098 --> 15:34.683
to be thrown around so lightly.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.895
I suggest that if you don't have evidence
to back them up,

15:38.354 --> 15:42.232
join the rest of us in accepting
that El Chapo Guzman... is dead.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.652
We'll be in touch.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.825
Up next, images from
the press conference

15:51.951 --> 15:55.287
the Government secretary,
Conrado Sol, offered this morning.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.250
The theft of Chapo's body doesn't blur
the absolute fact

16:00.376 --> 16:02.544
that the biggest drug dealer
in the world has fallen,

16:03.128 --> 16:08.008
thanks to impeccable work
by the armed forces of this county.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.843
My commitment to Mexico

16:10.135 --> 16:13.305
was to catch the biggest criminal
in its history,

16:13.764 --> 16:15.015
and I have succeeded.

16:17.726 --> 16:18.686
I'm dead.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.065
Now, I have to make sure
they remember me forever.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.947
Keep going straight!
Keep going straight!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.367
Don't let them come through.

16:42.001 --> 16:47.756
VANESSA ESPINOZA PRESENTS
THE TRUE STORY OF EL CHAPO GUZMAN

16:56.223 --> 16:58.642
Dude, now I'm getting out of here.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.602
I'm on the boat.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.612
Is the information trustworthy?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.659
Are you happy with the result?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.786
We are very happy.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.330
I'm very excited to be here today,

17:20.456 --> 17:24.168
at this big premiere, with this project
we made with great effort,

17:24.251 --> 17:26.754
but it's finally here
and I hope people people enjoy it.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.548
Do you think El Chapo would've been happy
with this movie about his life?

17:29.715 --> 17:30.674
I hope so.

17:30.758 --> 17:31.967
What's next for your career?

17:33.302 --> 17:35.763
A lot of projects,
but nothing confirmed, so...

17:35.846 --> 17:37.431
I'll let you all know soon.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.266
In how many theaters
will this be screened?

17:39.725 --> 17:40.768
More than a thousand.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.604
Friend.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.528
Mr. Joaquin, what are you doing here?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.865
I couldn't miss the movie.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.326
I also wanted to say goodbye.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.453
This will be the last time we meet.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.124
Now that I'm not being chased,
I'm going with my girls and my wife.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.252
I'm gonna get the ending
I've always wanted.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.671
To die old and be free.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.299
Surrounded by my people.

18:14.051 --> 18:14.968
But, sir,

18:15.177 --> 18:17.763
nothing that you've told me
has really happened.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.310
That's what movies are for, right?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.271
To tell it how you want it to be.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.608
I'm sorry, but I can't make a story

18:29.691 --> 18:32.319
of made-up things.
I want to tell the truth.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.865
Reality is not as interesting
as you may think.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.492
But it is in this case, sir.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.160
Because your life is extraordinary,

18:40.244 --> 18:43.163
and not telling the events
as they occurred would be a waste.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.835
Also, please, take into consideration
that if I make this movie,

18:47.918 --> 18:50.671
I want to redeem the victims
of organized crime.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.092
You have a big heart, friend.

18:56.093 --> 18:56.969
I trust you.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.763
You choose what you want to say.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.724
Thank you, sir.

19:03.100 --> 19:03.976
Well, cheers.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.572
Thank you for coming.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.367
Everything is ready for you
to spend the night here.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.038
I'm going to leave.
If I stay, I'd be putting you at risk.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.172
Let's go!

19:55.444 --> 19:58.030
MEXICO CITY

19:58.447 --> 20:00.073
This is where we picked up
the last signal of the aircraft...

20:00.157 --> 20:00.991
DEPARTMENT OF INTELLIGENCE DISE

20:01.074 --> 20:02.159
...in which the actress was traveling.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.162
We have sent units
to cover this entire zone.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.331
But as you can see, it's a massive area.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.999
So, there's not guarantee of results?

20:09.833 --> 20:11.084
No, Mr. Secretary.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.548
Keep looking.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.134
But let's concentrate on Culiacan, also.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.845
Conduct raids, question anyone
that can have information

20:21.929 --> 20:23.096
about El Chapo or his family.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.515
Any information is useful.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.851
I'll take care of it personally.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.817
When are you heading to Monterrey?

20:35.901 --> 20:36.818
REHABILITA NGO
MEXICO CITY

20:37.694 --> 20:39.363
In a couple of weeks, sir.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.282
I want to finish training
the new counselor.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.744
We really appreciate you here, Sebastian.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.664
Come back and visit once in a while.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.832
I promise, no doubt about that.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.544
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

21:08.976 --> 21:09.935
Hello?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.186
It's me.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.859
UNKNOWN NUMBER

21:44.553 --> 21:46.054
INCOMING CALL
IT DEPARTMENT

21:48.598 --> 21:49.599
Did you find anything?

21:52.936 --> 21:54.187
Let's meet at the office.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.150
Is everything ready for Elba and the kids?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.652
Almost, sir.
Security in Culiacan is heavy,

22:00.736 --> 22:02.154
but your idea might work.

22:02.612 --> 22:03.780
They're going to try tomorrow.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.616
Prepare everything to leave tomorrow.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.744
Saying goodbye to them
is the only thing left.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.204
As soon as I do it, we get out of here.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.335
It was a lot of work.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.212
Your wife is very discreet,
but I found something interesting.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.768
Miami?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.562
It's under her ex-husband's name.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.606
Here are the papers that prove it.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.586
These are the people captured
in the raids.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.548
Many of them have an indirect or direct
relationship with the Sinaloa cartel.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.258
Get the
interrogation room ready.

23:05.425 --> 23:08.428
We're not getting out of here until one
of them gives us a clue to catch Guzman.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.129
I thought you'd be better at
covering your tracks.

23:45.048 --> 23:48.593
Not declaring such a valuable property
can get you in trouble.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.471
If this information gets to the press,

23:52.347 --> 23:54.641
your image as an honest senator
will be ruined.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.812
The voice of the women in need
of this country.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.903
The pressure ends from here on out, Berta.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.407
I'll make decisions by myself.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.742
And if I see it necessary,
I'll let you know.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.207
In the end, you ended up being as
chauvinistic as any other.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.546
Gay, cheap, and chauvinist.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.591
I'll get to the presidency
despite all of that.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.844
And you will have to wait your turn.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.682
It will come to you,
but only if we're together.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.976
You forget about Sebastian...

24:38.977 --> 24:41.188
and I forget your apartment in Miami.

24:42.814 --> 24:43.648
Agreed?

24:53.408 --> 24:54.618
Conrado.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.205
You have to catch Chapo.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.041
If not, neither of us will get anywhere.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.793
I'll catch him, don't worry.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.630
Sir, the General
is on the line.

25:49.005 --> 25:49.923
Put him through.

25:53.426 --> 25:54.469
Did you get anything?

25:54.844 --> 25:56.221
Yes, sir.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.057
It's not much, but it might be useful.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.435
Chapo's daughters have a peculiar pet,

26:02.852 --> 26:03.895
a monkey.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.612
There you go.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.824
You'll go in the blue car
with one of them,

26:16.157 --> 26:18.743
and you, Mom,
you'll go with the other in the van.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.996
And Perez will go later, baby.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.498
I want to travel with him.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.670
You'll go see your dad first, OK?

26:29.212 --> 26:31.089
And then he gets there later, huh?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.216
I'm taking him, promise.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.259
-Oh!
-

26:34.342 --> 26:36.011
-That's it, let's go!
-Come on.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.929
You too. That's it, let's go.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.390
-Look.
-Let's go.

26:40.974 --> 26:41.891
That's it.

27:04.622 --> 27:05.540
Hello?

27:06.458 --> 27:07.625
Are you ready?

27:53.922 --> 27:54.964
Afternoon.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.883
Papers, please.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.268
Sorry, officer, I forgot them.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.522
What's that?

28:11.481 --> 28:13.858
Nothing, things for my daughters.

28:14.609 --> 28:15.735
Open up, please.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.946
It's nothing, officer.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.782
We have to check all the cars, open up.

28:35.839 --> 28:36.881
You have twins?

28:37.590 --> 28:38.591
Yes.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.321
Get out of the car, please.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.853
Send back-up,
we got Chapo's wife!

29:44.741 --> 29:45.700
All clear.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.413
You can go through now.

29:50.705 --> 29:51.581
It's clear.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.190
Miss Elba and the girls left
Culiacan without a problem, Mr. Joaquin.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.983
The plane is bringing them.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.018
Turn around, miss.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.399
This is not Elba Coronado.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.327
Now, you and I are going to take a trip.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.729
Hi, baby! How are you?

31:37.937 --> 31:42.358
Come here, my beautiful queen!

31:46.070 --> 31:47.947
My beautiful baby!

31:48.865 --> 31:50.283
How are you, baby?

31:54.579 --> 31:55.955
With daddy, too!

31:56.039 --> 31:58.082
With daddy, too!

32:05.548 --> 32:07.133
I'm going to the strip, Capi.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.509
I'll be there in ten minutes.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.597
It's overcast, we can't take off.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.057
Fuck!

32:14.140 --> 32:17.352
I'll let you know, but I don't think we
can leave for a couple of hours.

32:22.690 --> 32:23.691
Don't worry.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.152
I'm gonna take you to the girls anyway.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.518
Here you go, officer.

33:08.903 --> 33:09.862
Is that yours?

33:10.446 --> 33:12.657
Yes, we're going to the vet.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.343
A man just left Culiacan with a monkey.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.636
He's driving a red Mustang.

33:36.014 --> 33:40.018
There's a suspect driving
a red sports car on the road to Cosala.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.606
MILITARY BASE
COSALA, MEXICO

34:23.936 --> 34:25.021
When are you leaving?

34:31.194 --> 34:32.528
When you leave.

34:35.448 --> 34:36.949
When are we going to see you again?

34:38.659 --> 34:39.494
Soon.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.206
I've always been positive.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.585
You'll see I'll find a place
to relax soon.

34:48.461 --> 34:49.504
And I'll send for you.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.967
You're not going back to Mexico.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.179
Not for now.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.684
Not until the next elections.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.897
And I'll try to negotiate
with the next government.

35:08.689 --> 35:09.941
You have the exact location?

35:12.360 --> 35:15.154
Yes, sir. We know where
the red Mustang arrived.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.079
What is Hector doing here?

35:24.580 --> 35:26.415
He promised the girls
he would bring the monkey.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.501
They don't like to be apart from it.

35:32.880 --> 35:37.301
It's a complicated terrain.
We can't get in until the skies clear.

35:38.427 --> 35:40.054
How long will that take?

35:40.179 --> 35:42.640
We calculate at least one more hour, sir.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.727
At least we know that if we can't get in,

35:47.145 --> 35:48.729
El Chapo can't get out.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.314
Not in an airplane.

35:51.941 --> 35:54.068
Let us know when you can
start the operation.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.945
On your command, sir.

36:15.798 --> 36:16.632
Sir.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.051
The pilot called, we can leave now.

36:27.852 --> 36:28.811
My darlings...

36:33.107 --> 36:35.359
Kiss. You have to go.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.112
I'll see you soon.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.703
-Take care of them.
-Of course, Joaquin.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.583
Take them straight to the plane.

36:52.960 --> 36:53.878
Let's go.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.220
I love you.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.389
Ciao.

37:18.527 --> 37:19.862
Come in, Commander.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.283
We're getting close
to the point, sir.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.452
One team will stay at the entrance
of the highway, and another two

37:26.535 --> 37:30.414
will get down to the highest part.
We'll make contact in five minutes.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.000
Bring him in alive.

37:41.842 --> 37:44.178
Everything's ready to go
to Puerto La Cruz.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.223
Did Elba and the girls take off?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.392
Yes, sir. No news.

37:53.562 --> 37:54.605
Let's go.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.691
We got nothing to do here.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.151
Get the boss, the anchor dropped!

37:59.443 --> 38:00.611
Wait here!

38:06.117 --> 38:07.660
Get to the ATV's, sir!

38:10.413 --> 38:11.539
Don't stop, come on!

38:34.478 --> 38:36.480
Go down the hill, I'll cover you!

39:08.179 --> 39:09.180
It's me!

39:09.430 --> 39:11.390
-Are you hit?
-No, get me out of here.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.700
