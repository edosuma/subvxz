WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:07.382
Oh, shit.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.886
I heard it.

00:13.054 --> 00:13.972
I'm sorry.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.058
What time is it?

00:17.142 --> 00:20.020
-It's five.
-Oh, fuck.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.563
I didn't go to sleep till four.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.149
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, come back to bed.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.817
-I can't.
-What?

00:25.900 --> 00:28.028
I have an early class.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.363
If I don't go home first
and wake Brady up,

00:30.447 --> 00:31.573
he'll sleep all day.

00:31.656 --> 00:34.159
Sleep all day.
That sounds so good.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.412
Go to sleep.
I'll be outta here in two minutes.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.371
Ow!

00:38.455 --> 00:39.831
Oh, my God.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.125
Shit. Sorry.

00:43.793 --> 00:44.878
Fuck.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.072
Morning, pumpkin!

01:12.906 --> 01:15.075
I got our pumpkin.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.369
And there's

01:18.661 --> 01:20.246
there's pancakes.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.041
Not pumpkin.
Dropped the ball there.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.085
Mom, I told you, you don't have
to come all the way over here

01:25.168 --> 01:26.670
every morning just to make me breakfast.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.755
I know, but I like it.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.840
And the two of you
would starve if I didn't.

01:31.758 --> 01:35.512
Hey, so, after you eat,
you wanna help me decorate the stoop?

01:36.262 --> 01:39.432
We can't be the only house on the block
with no Halloween spirit.

01:39.515 --> 01:41.142
Isn't this house already scary enough?

01:47.315 --> 01:49.401
Charlotte is going to kill us

01:49.484 --> 01:52.320
for not wearing costumes
to her fundraiser.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.988
I am wearing a costume.

01:54.906 --> 02:00.370
I'm Helen Gurley Brown, writer and founder
of "Cosmopolitan" magazine, circa 1970.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.623
I just thought you were you.

02:03.707 --> 02:08.169
When have you ever
seen me wear bows in my hair like this?

02:08.252 --> 02:10.255
I don't know. Wednesday?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.342
It's gonna be an early night for me.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.387
I've lost all my sleep in
the Bermuda Schlepping Triangle

02:17.470 --> 02:20.098
between Che's apartment,
Brooklyn, and Columbia,

02:20.181 --> 02:23.268
so I'm wrecked and in a terrible mood.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.728
Now see, you did come in a costume.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.605
-You came as a giant bummer.
-Yeah.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.025
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Thanks for having us.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.570
-Guys!
-Hi!

02:33.653 --> 02:36.281
-It's a costume party!
-I'm Helen Gurley Brown.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.576
I have seen you wear that dress before.
It is not a costume.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.786
Charlotte, did you really think
I was gonna come as Belle

02:41.870 --> 02:43.329
from "Beauty and the Beast"?

02:43.413 --> 02:45.373
I knew this would be an issue.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.958
-So--
-Ooh...

02:47.542 --> 02:50.420
I've come as the comic disaster
that is my life.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.255
For the record,
you're not in a costume either.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.340
Yeah.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.425
Yes, I am! I'm Elizabeth Jennings.

02:55.966 --> 02:57.927
You know, from "The Americans."

02:58.011 --> 03:00.055
No, still think it's you.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.598
Okay, wait. You have to see us together.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.892
Harry! Honey, honey, come here.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.895
Okay, yes!

03:06.978 --> 03:10.648
Now we know it's not you
'cause Harry has hair.

03:10.732 --> 03:15.695
We are a husband and wife team
of Russian spies in the '80s.

03:15.779 --> 03:19.366
I'm Keri Russell, and he is Matthew Rhys.

03:19.449 --> 03:23.078
See? I have smokey eye,
hair on one side.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.415
Babe, how come nobody's gettin' this?

03:27.499 --> 03:28.958
I've no idea what you're talkin' about,

03:29.042 --> 03:30.835
but I am totally on board
with Harry's hair.

03:30.919 --> 03:31.795
Right?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.963
Right? This is me in eighth grade!

03:50.563 --> 03:54.025
If one more foodie asks
if I'm supposed to be Padma Lakshmi,

03:54.109 --> 03:56.486
I will file a class-action lawsuit.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.906
Okay, we have a winner.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.159
Thank you.
Gettin' my little Eartha Kitt on.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.954
And for what? Not one fine man here.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.456
Sweetie, complete waste of Lycra.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.668
It's a charity event with all married men
and dad bods.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.587
I saw a Captain Jack Sparrow over there.
He's kinda hot.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.630
I saw him, too. He's a woman.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.007
Well, I need a man.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.426
And my free one-month subscription

04:19.509 --> 04:21.344
in Chocolate Singles
only got me cyber-stalked

04:21.428 --> 04:23.138
by a white guy named Jeff.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.597
So, white chocolate?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.391
And we all know
white chocolate isn't real.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.144
Fret not, I will take you to the place

04:29.227 --> 04:31.312
-to meet single men.
-Which is?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.148
A sperm bank? A monastery?

04:33.231 --> 04:34.399
A Marvel movie?

04:34.482 --> 04:36.609
A five-star hotel bar.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.862
Super expensive rooms,
so you know he has coin,

04:38.945 --> 04:41.489
and deadbeats aren't allowed to wander in
off the street.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.952
So, what do you say, Carrie?
Do we show this newbie the ropes?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.163
Yeah, sure. I'm in.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.123
You are?

04:51.499 --> 04:53.001
I'm kinda surprised.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.377
"I'm a mouse on the outside,

04:54.461 --> 04:57.464
but inside, I'm this tiger,
and I have to get on with it."

04:57.547 --> 04:59.674
It's a quote from Helen Gurley Brown.

05:09.934 --> 05:10.935
I'm out.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.854
You finally made it!

05:13.646 --> 05:17.317
You are one lucky Frankenstein.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.610
Thanks.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.071
Why did I go through the trouble

05:21.154 --> 05:24.074
of renting you a very expensive
George Washington outfit

05:24.157 --> 05:26.409
-and you don't even wear it?
-Baby, this is a public event.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.371
I didn't wanna end up on Page Six
in a powdered wig.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.457
Also, not great press optics,
you dirty dancing with the Devil.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.707
Well, hon, he's gay.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.126
People don't know that.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.714
He knew the Left Eye, the T-Boz,
and the Chilli parts verbatim. They know.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.883
Well, it wasn't very dignified.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.220
And besides, this political run
was your idea, remember?

05:45.303 --> 05:48.932
Well, it wasn't my idea
for you to lose all sense of fun.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.851
It's Halloween. Loosen up a bit.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.980
It was on FX for seven seasons.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.983
It won countless Emmys.
And a Peabody.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.277
I look exactly like her.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.824
Like Batman is so original.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.583
Hail Spartacus!

06:16.167 --> 06:18.128
I'd recognize those thighs anywhere.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.091
Straightest party ever.
We're the only two gay guys here.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.051
Anthony, from the gym.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.971
Still can't place me?

06:28.638 --> 06:32.225
Imagine my hand
surrounded by a lotta steam.

06:33.183 --> 06:34.519
This is my wife.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.571
Yeah, straight guy with abs like that.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.665
Are you really going to a hotel bar
to look for men?

06:55.749 --> 06:58.710
Well, if you want a man in your life,

06:58.793 --> 07:02.172
ya can't just sit home
and wait for him to come to you.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.966
All right, Helen Gurley Brown.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.053
Actually, that one was me.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.157
The British are coming.

07:32.159 --> 07:33.745
-That's Paul Revere.
-I know,

07:33.828 --> 07:35.663
but the founding father
never said anything famous

07:35.747 --> 07:37.874
with the word "coming" in it, so

07:38.875 --> 07:39.959
just go with it.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.838
You look bizarrely hot.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.470
But before we get down
to business, Mr. President,

07:50.553 --> 07:53.181
I know you're running
for City Comptroller and all

07:53.264 --> 07:56.476
but you don't get to "comptroll" me.

07:58.103 --> 08:01.856
The message from the councilwoman
on the comforter

08:02.691 --> 08:04.818
-is received.
-You sure?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.111
Oh, yes.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.154
And I cannot tell a lie.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.491
Don't, don't touch my hair.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.911
Isn't that what you always say?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.667
Nobody can challenge him
if he has the capability

08:20.750 --> 08:22.293
to launch America's nuclear arsenal.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.963
What more do you need?
A written manifesto?

08:25.046 --> 08:28.216
This show is brilliant. Everyone's insane.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.052
Mom, Dad, you will not believe
what just happened!

08:31.136 --> 08:32.345
Can it wait till after this scene?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.556
No. I was at the park
and I landed an ollie

08:34.639 --> 08:36.765
and this cool guy came up to me
and said I was awesome

08:36.850 --> 08:39.227
and wanted to know if I ever thought
about modeling.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.020
What are you saying? What cool guy?

08:41.104 --> 08:42.647
At the park. He wants you to call him.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.899
We are not callin'
some creep from the park.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.443
No, we certainly are not.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.111
Oh, my God.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.655
This is Ralph Lauren.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.449
This guy works for Ralph Lauren?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.992
You know who else works for Ralph Lauren?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.869
Me, as soon as I go to Kinko's

08:55.952 --> 08:57.662
and make a bunch of fake business cards.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.666
This is embossed
with the Ralph Lauren logo.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.460
It's his real logo!

09:03.543 --> 09:05.503
Please, please, please,
please can we call him?

09:05.587 --> 09:08.715
-It'd be so awesome!
-It is a scam.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.550
You think some guy
hangin' around a bunch of kids

09:10.633 --> 09:12.552
at a skate park is scoutin' models?

09:13.094 --> 09:16.348
Honey, this show has made you paranoid.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.266
What's the harm in calling?

09:18.350 --> 09:21.478
Because if this guy
really works for Ralph Lauren,

09:21.561 --> 09:23.521
then he works for Ralph Lauren!

09:23.605 --> 09:24.522
Go, Mom!

09:24.606 --> 09:27.567
You know, in high school,
I was a model at the mall.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.194
And guess who I wore?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.612
Ralph Lauren.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.739
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.326
Last time I went to a bar to meet a man

09:37.077 --> 09:38.119
my phone folded.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.247
Last time I went to a bar
to meet a man was

09:43.290 --> 09:44.459
never.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.835
-How is that possible?
-What?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.630
Andre and I started dating
when I was a junior in college

09:48.713 --> 09:51.091
and I met my high school
boyfriend at Model U.N.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.635
Always wondered who did Model U.N.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.389
So, by my calculations,
you've only seen two dicks.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.725
I saw more than that
last time I was on the subway.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.769
Do those count?
Well, then I've seen three.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.105
Can I ask how many you've seen?

10:05.188 --> 10:06.981
Enough that you can't surprise me.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.902
-Carrie?
-Oh, I'm still surprise-able.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.241
Excuse me, ma'am, are you shocked
this bar doesn't carry Nettle Field gin?

10:16.324 --> 10:18.618
No, I'm shocked that you
are calling me "ma'am."

10:18.702 --> 10:21.705
Well, I was told that's how you
address royalty.

10:23.331 --> 10:27.419
See, now, I'd buy you a Nettle Field
gin martini but this bar doesn't carry it.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.631
Why do you keep saying "Nettle Field gin"
as if it's a thing?

10:32.007 --> 10:34.467
I rep the brand.
I'm trying to get into this hotel chain.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.514
Excuse me, bartender.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.517
Can I have a Nettle Field gin martini?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.477
I just told him,
we don't carry that brand.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.855
Why not? I hear it's amazing.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.985
I owe you a bottle.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.486
Only one?

10:53.570 --> 10:56.448
Mama done hooked a fish.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.120
Oh, my God.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.455
Wait.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.833
Is this a bar or an aquarium?

11:06.916 --> 11:09.502
I think I just found my chocolate single.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.504
-Hi.
-Evening.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.589
Hello.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.594
-My name is Ian.
-Hi, Ian.

11:18.303 --> 11:21.139
May I buy you a drink?

11:21.765 --> 11:22.640
Sure.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.229
Well, perfect time for Wordle.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.654
You are very, very hot, your highness.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.740
Thank you. So are you.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.624
Look, I just wanna put this out there,
it has nothing to do with you

11:47.707 --> 11:49.959
but, sometimes, I suffer from ED.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.296
Erectile dysfunction.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.298
Got it.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.760
I appreciate the sensitivity,
but the way things are going tonight,

11:58.843 --> 12:01.429
I just don't think
that's gonna be an issue.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.393
-So, we're cool?
-Yeah, we're cool.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.894
We're cool.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.148
Some ladies are not cool with it.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.444
Well, I guess some women
might feel a little insecure

12:16.528 --> 12:17.862
when--

12:29.916 --> 12:31.251
Only really takes a sec.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.587
-That's cool.
-Okay.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.260
-Make this count. Last round, last round.
-I can't, I'm too drunk!

12:41.970 --> 12:45.015
-Period!
-I'm out of rolling papers.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.142
-Carry on without me.
-Okay. Gimme a light.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.226
But just, like, keep it down.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.688
Somebody's asleep in the next room!

12:54.607 --> 12:57.193
Oh, shit. Fuck.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.195
It's okay. I'm awake.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.907
Oh, God. Why don't--
Do you not have the earplugs in?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.325
They don't work.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.456
-What time is it?
-It's 3:30.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.708
-Oh, my God!
-I just go back to sleep.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.877
-I have to be up at five.
-I am so sorry.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.713
I just need rolling papers,
but we're gonna totally keep it down.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.673
Okay? Ow! Fuck! Shit!

13:20.508 --> 13:22.927
I'm gonna burn that fucking chair.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.604
Good morning.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.325
There she is.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.035
Sorry I had to cancel lunch.

13:47.118 --> 13:50.121
I got a late start today
because that guy stayed over.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.040
Really, really? How was that?

13:52.123 --> 13:54.918
Let's just say I'm still surprise-able.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.629
-He had a penis pump.
-What?

13:57.712 --> 13:59.673
-Bike lane! Bike lane!
-He had to pump up his dick.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.882
Bike lane! Bike lane!

14:00.965 --> 14:02.884
-Bike lane!
-Oh, my God!

14:02.967 --> 14:04.052
-Oh, my God!
-Exactly!

14:04.135 --> 14:06.846
No, not you.
Oh, my God, I have to go.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.556
I think I may have killed a man.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.017
You can't stop
in the middle of a bike lane!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.103
Oh, my God!
I know, I know, I know that.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.771
-I know. I'm so sorry.
-Fuck.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.022
My friend was telling me something

14:16.106 --> 14:17.732
that literally stopped me in my tracks.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.276
Never, never mind.
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.986
Do you want me to call an ambulance,
maybe?

14:22.070 --> 14:22.946
No.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.239
-Here let me, let me--
-God!

14:24.322 --> 14:25.907
Not my arm.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.451
-Sorry. I'm so sorry.
-God.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.286
It's my wrist.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.497
-It might be sprained. At least I--
-Really?

14:32.580 --> 14:35.375
I hope it's-- Ow.
I hope it's only sprained.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.794
Well, can I take you to an Urgent Care?

14:37.877 --> 14:41.089
'Cause I also-- I think I heard a crack,
and a crack is never good.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.633
-Probably just my helmet.
-There's one on 14th Street.

14:43.717 --> 14:47.262
I know, because--
Once I saw an Olsen twin go in there.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.348
I mean, that's why it,
that's why it stuck in my mind, you know,

14:50.432 --> 14:54.936
because, like,
what kind of Urgent Care on 14th Street

14:55.020 --> 14:57.272
would an Olsen twin need, you know?

14:57.355 --> 14:59.399
Do they live around here, you know?

14:59.482 --> 15:02.694
I'm sorry, I'm just-- I'm so--
I'm nervously talking 'cause I'm--

15:02.777 --> 15:05.697
Would you please-- Can I please
take you to the Urgent Care?

15:05.780 --> 15:10.493
All right, yeah, maybe 'cause my wrist
is really starting to pound.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.037
Okay.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.540
-I'll get your bike for you.
-Yeah, please. Oh, God.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.126
Here, just--

15:18.209 --> 15:21.171
I got it, I got it. Watch-- I'm so sorry.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.382
I got a busy day,
so I hope that they're quick.

15:24.466 --> 15:27.177
Well, I mean,
"urgent" is in their name, so...

15:27.260 --> 15:28.428
Yeah, not in yours.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.222
No, sorry. We'll go this way.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.183
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Fuck.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.435
I never, ever--
I'm not one of those people.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.480
I've lived here forever.
I never stop in a bike lane.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.608
Hi, I know we're at the back of the line,
but I heard him hit his head

15:41.691 --> 15:43.151
and I'm worried about a clot.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.904
Ma'am, we will get to you
as soon as we can. I promise.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.197
No, I get it. I do.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.492
I just don't wanna be
responsible for a clot.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.495
Ya know? I've gotta cover my bases.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.414
You wanna move it along?
Go fill these out for your friend.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.917
Okay. Thank you. Will do. Thank you.

16:00.377 --> 16:04.464
Thank you. Shit, this is
so not a good time for a broken wrist.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.217
Broken?
What happened to a sprain?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.053
Well, it's kind of killing me
to text, so...

16:11.096 --> 16:12.389
-Here.
-Well, do you want me to help

16:12.472 --> 16:14.099
you fill these forms out? Yeah?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.143
-Oh, yeah. Thank you.
-Okay.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.895
No problem. Of course.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.273
Okay, name and date of birth.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.150
George Campbell.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.986
George Campbell. C-A-M--

16:27.070 --> 16:28.655
-P-B-E-L-L.
-P-- E-L-L.

16:28.738 --> 16:29.698
-Yep.
-Date of birth?

16:29.781 --> 16:32.450
10-17-68.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.327
Happy belated birthday.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.579
Address?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.457
-245 East 29th.
-Two--

16:40.000 --> 16:46.006
Really? Oh, my God, that's so funny.
I'm 245 East 73rd Street.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.090
We're related.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.052
Okay, moving on to the tougher stuff.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.055
Emergency contact.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.432
My partner, Paul Bennett.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.518
-B-E-N-N-E-T-T.
-Partner, gotcha.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.230
No, not husband partner.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.482
Business partner.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.152
Yeah. Never been married.

17:07.861 --> 17:08.737
Okay.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.195
Speak of the Devil.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.575
-Hi, Paul.
-Man, where are you?

17:13.657 --> 17:15.535
The final version
of that app deck is due--

17:15.617 --> 17:18.246
In two days. Believe me, I know.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.748
I am at Urgent Care,

17:19.830 --> 17:22.166
-so here.
-No, this is urgent. Okay?

17:22.250 --> 17:25.045
We're running out of buyers.
It's do or die!

17:25.127 --> 17:26.796
Yeah, all right, let me finish.

17:26.880 --> 17:32.719
I am here, stuck in whatever the opposite
of a hit-and-run is. Meet Carrie.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.804
Hi, hi.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.266
Again, I'm mortified about this.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.560
I'll never get used to those bike lanes.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.897
They didn't have 'em when
I came to New York in 1822.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.857
-George?
-Sir, with the wrist?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.734
You can go back to exam room two.

17:47.817 --> 17:48.902
What is goin' on over there?

17:48.985 --> 17:49.944
Paul, I'll call you back.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.156
-Okay.
-Do you need help with--

17:53.239 --> 17:55.408
Nah, I'm good. I'll just take this.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.161
-And I'll take that.
-Yep.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.747
And thank you.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.499
-Of course. Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.750
I'll say hi to the Olsens.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.589
-I'm home!
-Hi, Dad!

18:10.131 --> 18:12.258
Whoa! Rock is helpin' to make dinner.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.719
What? Did I come home to the wrong house?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.180
What is this Norman Rockwell scene here?

18:17.263 --> 18:19.849
Honey, we have been
doing some more research

18:19.933 --> 18:21.476
on the Ralph Lauren shoot.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.145
Honey, absolutely not.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.982
I'm just-- I'm really--
I'm smellin' a "Taken" type

18:28.066 --> 18:30.652
kidnapping vibe here,
and I just--

18:31.111 --> 18:32.904
I don't have the muscle mass
to rescue Rock

18:32.987 --> 18:34.781
from a compound in Belize.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.491
Dad, it's not a kidnapping vibe.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.827
We Zoomed with the advertising team

18:38.910 --> 18:42.664
and it's actually quite legitimate
and impressive.

18:42.747 --> 18:47.961
It is a progressive family concept
and Rock will be wearing a Polo shirt,

18:48.044 --> 18:51.756
exactly what I wore as a teen model!

18:51.840 --> 18:54.134
Teen model. Next stop, rehab.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.387
-Mom's not a junkie.
-That's right! I'm not.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.473
Harry, you are being ridiculous.

19:00.557 --> 19:04.978
Rock really wants to do this
and they've come up with a great idea

19:05.061 --> 19:07.147
of how they would spend
the money they would make.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.274
Plant some trees in Israel!

19:11.317 --> 19:16.031
Look, even if it is legit,
it's gonna be exploitative.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.490
The next thing ya know, they're gonna be

19:17.574 --> 19:19.868
usin' Rock's likeness
in God knows what kinda ad.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.996
Harry, this is a Polo campaign.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.915
-What could they do?
-Dad, I hear you.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.335
So you don't have to come
'cause Mom's gonna take me.

19:29.044 --> 19:30.587
It'll be awesome.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.381
Slippery slope.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.219
I don't know why they call this place
Urgent Care.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.221
It should be called
"I Hope You Have Nothing Else

19:40.305 --> 19:42.182
Planned for the Rest of the Day" Care.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.641
Why are you still there?

19:43.725 --> 19:46.895
Because I made the mistake
of telling him my name,

19:46.978 --> 19:48.688
so now I'm implicated.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.941
I don't wanna get sued.
I'm Google-able.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.778
And, you know, the poor guy can't type.

19:54.861 --> 19:59.491
He's got this big sales presentation
in two days

19:59.574 --> 20:03.745
and it's all about an app
he's desperate to sell. At his age?

20:03.828 --> 20:05.747
I mean, oh, God.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.917
I just hope I didn't ruin his big chance.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.585
Maybe I should just write him a check.

20:10.669 --> 20:13.171
You're a pushover, like me.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.132
Since when are you a pushover?

20:16.216 --> 20:20.553
Since last night.
I told pump gin guy I'd see him again.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.598
-Seriously?
-Dating at this age,

20:23.682 --> 20:25.308
there's always something.

20:25.392 --> 20:29.437
We had 30 minutes of great foreplay,

20:29.521 --> 20:33.400
a bizarre intermission,
followed by B-plus sex.

20:33.483 --> 20:34.984
Well, what are you gonna do
if he doesn't bring it?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.654
You gonna swap in the pump
you use for your yoga ball?

20:37.737 --> 20:41.866
With most of these guys, I have to
get myself off anyway at the end.

20:41.950 --> 20:46.454
And at least with him,
I had some laughs and a sexy spoon after.

20:46.871 --> 20:47.872
'Kay, gotta go. Bye.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.628
You're still here?
Waiting for a total stranger?

20:53.712 --> 20:55.880
-That is very cool.
-How's the wrist feeling?

20:55.964 --> 20:57.841
-It's pretty good.
-Oh, great.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.718
Great, I just wanted to make sure
it wasn't broken.

20:59.801 --> 21:03.513
Oh, yeah, no. It's definitely broken.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.391
That must have been the opioids talking.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.018
Sir, the card ya gave us

21:08.101 --> 21:10.228
earlier to put on file was declined.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.273
Oh, right. Shit, that one's no good.

21:14.399 --> 21:18.570
Yeah, here. Sorry, this one.

21:23.575 --> 21:26.411
Actually, sorry. Do that one.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.412
Sorry, yeah.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.497
It was so great.

21:29.581 --> 21:33.710
I felt like everyone on the street
was giving me that "you just had sex" eye.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.212
I love you having a hot walk of shame.

21:36.296 --> 21:40.800
I mean, I get it now.
These one-night stands are amazing!

21:40.884 --> 21:41.885
Afternoon, Professor Wallace.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.428
Good afternoon, ladies.

21:46.431 --> 21:49.601
We did it all night long

21:49.684 --> 21:52.354
and then, I got up,
got dressed, went home,

21:52.437 --> 21:54.981
and slept in my own bed until two.

21:55.065 --> 21:58.318
Jealous. Not of the sex, of the sleep.

21:59.194 --> 22:02.614
-What?
-I'm early mornings, Che's late nights.

22:02.697 --> 22:05.575
I would only sleep there on the weekends
when we could stay in bed,

22:05.658 --> 22:08.203
if I had literally anywhere else to go.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.416
You do. Andre's music room is empty.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.169
Crash there until Steve finds a new place.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.339
That's an incredible offer!

22:19.422 --> 22:22.300
But you don't really mean that.
You're just being nice.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.094
I'm not nice, and I do mean it.

22:24.177 --> 22:27.055
Miranda, I don't really like living alone.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.973
And you can't keep going
from Che's to Brooklyn

22:29.057 --> 22:30.809
-at five in the morning.
-I can't.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.436
I'm exhausted, and I look it.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.729
You do.

22:38.149 --> 22:39.693
I told you I'm not nice.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.118
Yes?

22:50.704 --> 22:53.456
If this is George Campbell, this is,

22:53.540 --> 22:56.042
this is your near-assassin,
Carrie Bradshaw.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.420
Come on in.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.964
Thank you.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.728
Hello?

23:21.234 --> 23:22.152
Hi there.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.529
-Hey.
-You again?

23:26.156 --> 23:30.076
Do you live here,
or are you temping for an art gallery?

23:30.160 --> 23:32.912
Nope, I live here.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.414
Oh, my.

23:34.914 --> 23:39.169
Was it previously a train station?
Or...

23:39.586 --> 23:42.672
-an airplane hangar?
-What a nice surprise.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.633
Unless you're here
to break my other wrist?

23:45.717 --> 23:47.635
No, no, no, no, no. No, I come in peace.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.431
Well, actually, it's guilt.

23:51.514 --> 23:56.895
And to offer lunch and my intact wrists
to help with your big presentation,

23:56.978 --> 23:58.480
if that's not weird.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.149
It's definitely weird.

24:01.816 --> 24:04.027
-Okay.
-But I can-- I will

24:04.110 --> 24:07.113
take your help because
I just ran out of Percocet.

24:07.197 --> 24:08.865
Oh, no.

24:09.366 --> 24:12.202
So, I assume you are
proficient in Python?

24:13.078 --> 24:15.413
I type 92 words a minute.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.210
Carrot Ginger, Matzo Ball, and Pea.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.754
There's enough food here for a week.

24:23.380 --> 24:26.132
Who has three different soups for lunch?

24:26.216 --> 24:29.177
-I was thinking maybe you could freeze it.
-What?

24:30.553 --> 24:32.597
I don't know when your last meal was.

24:33.306 --> 24:36.559
-Do I look like I'm starving?
-No.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.229
You know, just 'cause I'm not married

24:39.312 --> 24:42.232
doesn't mean that I don't know
how to cook or order in.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.317
No, it wasn't that.

24:44.401 --> 24:50.115
I just thought that perhaps you were
in a bit of a bind.

24:51.199 --> 24:55.829
Because, you know,
the frantic, last-chance business call

24:55.912 --> 24:58.998
and then the credit card situation.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.379
Okay, so, that credit card was closed out
'cause of fraud

25:05.255 --> 25:08.717
and Paul and I have just put
way too much time into that app

25:08.800 --> 25:10.677
to see it go down the tubes.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.513
You know, we've been hustling
in the tech space since college.

25:14.014 --> 25:18.643
Beer pong to all this. It's impressive.

25:18.727 --> 25:21.521
Yeah, we've sold three apps.

25:22.355 --> 25:27.569
Hopefully, four if you and I
can ever get down to work.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.071
-My wrists are all yours.
-Thank you.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.992
-Okay.
-Here, hold on, let me just--

25:34.075 --> 25:35.201
Just gotta wake it up.

25:40.665 --> 25:42.125
Tiny wrists.

25:45.670 --> 25:46.880
That okay?

26:11.613 --> 26:15.950
Dude, fuckin' hang a towel on the door
if you got company.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.995
Yeah, no, and I thought we used a sock.

26:19.079 --> 26:21.039
Not time for comedy.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.416
Your dry cleaner called me again.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.793
This has been there a month.

26:25.710 --> 26:29.339
Anyway, Paul, this is Carrie.

26:30.715 --> 26:33.677
-FaceTime from Urgent C--
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Hi.

26:34.135 --> 26:36.054
Yeah, she's helping me out
with my mangled wrist.

26:36.137 --> 26:39.808
Not what it looks like.
We're on a deadline, bro.

26:40.392 --> 26:41.726
It's game time.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.526
Well, I should

26:50.485 --> 26:53.488
probably take my tiny wrists and go.

26:54.406 --> 26:57.409
It's rush hour. Can I borrow a bike?

26:58.034 --> 26:59.869
Yeah, sure.

27:04.249 --> 27:05.375
Never gonna happen.

27:06.209 --> 27:09.129
I take cabs. Enjoy the soups.

27:09.212 --> 27:13.675
ABC is, like, so excited.
And my agent's flying in for the testing,

27:13.758 --> 27:15.510
which is apparently a good sign.

27:18.179 --> 27:20.306
This red curry is not a joke.

27:21.141 --> 27:23.143
You know that's what happens when you
order something spicy.

27:23.226 --> 27:26.813
Yes, but I needed
something to wake me up.

27:27.647 --> 27:32.485
I am awake, so please, go on.
What is testing?

27:32.569 --> 27:35.363
So they ask a bunch of randos
that they find in Times Square

27:35.447 --> 27:37.657
to give feedback on my pilot.

27:37.741 --> 27:41.619
I guess it helps them figure out
how to best market the show to America.

27:41.703 --> 27:42.662
Thank you.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.293
Okay.

27:50.045 --> 27:51.004
So

27:52.130 --> 27:54.174
if my body survives this meal--

27:55.300 --> 27:58.511
I'm thinking I may move
into Nya's spare room.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.515
Sometimes,
I feel like I'm cramping your style.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.643
Meaning my loud-ass friends are keeping
you awake all night?

28:05.727 --> 28:06.811
Yes.

28:06.895 --> 28:10.065
And my crazy-ass schedule
is keeping you awake all morning.

28:10.148 --> 28:11.232
Is that right? I hadn't noticed.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.194
Plus, Nya's place is, like,

28:14.277 --> 28:16.613
-two minutes away from my house.
-Yeah.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.823
I love having ya there,
but whatever works

28:18.907 --> 28:20.533
best for you is what I want.

28:20.617 --> 28:23.953
And I'm still gonna sleep over
plenty of nights.

28:24.037 --> 28:24.954
Don't worry.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.749
The only thing I'm worried about

28:28.208 --> 28:29.501
is that spice all over your lips

28:29.584 --> 28:31.920
'cause I'm not tryna
have curry-lingus later.

28:33.129 --> 28:38.551
Look, honey.
Oh my, look at how professional!

28:38.635 --> 28:40.303
I am so proud of you.

28:40.387 --> 28:41.763
I haven't even done anything yet.

28:41.846 --> 28:43.515
That's okay. It's already amazing.

28:43.598 --> 28:46.518
Hey, Rock. I'm Bee.
I'll be your stylist today.

28:46.601 --> 28:47.727
Hi. Nice to meet you.

28:47.811 --> 28:49.813
-This is my mom.
-Hi. I'm Charlotte.

28:49.896 --> 28:53.817
-Are you wearing all vintage Ralph?
-Head to toe!

28:53.900 --> 28:56.528
I've been wearing him
since I was a teen model.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.656
Right this way.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.033
Sorry, "model" just came out.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.993
Thank you so much for asking me
to be here, honey.

29:04.077 --> 29:06.663
-It means a lot.
-I'm so glad you can be here with me.

29:06.746 --> 29:07.706
Chin up!

29:07.789 --> 29:11.001
So, how are you feelin' about
the whole roommate situation?

29:11.084 --> 29:11.960
Great!

29:12.460 --> 29:13.920
We're both going through divorces,

29:14.004 --> 29:16.506
so we'll be like an angry
Laverne and Shirley.

29:17.674 --> 29:20.176
Okay, the room is very small

29:20.260 --> 29:23.138
so if ya see a single bed that looks
like it won't fall apart

29:23.221 --> 29:26.850
before Steve finds a new place,
throw yourself on it.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.977
Well, it's been a couple months.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.312
How long will that be, exactly?

29:31.396 --> 29:33.648
I don't feel I can ask him.

29:33.732 --> 29:37.068
I don't feel like I'm allowed to ask
anything right now.

29:37.152 --> 29:42.240
Except to ask me to sit on
someone else's used mattress?

29:43.033 --> 29:45.702
These single beds look so sad.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.496
Well, look closer,
'cause maybe they're not.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.248
Case in point,

29:50.331 --> 29:53.793
the single man
I'm having dinner with tonight.

29:53.877 --> 29:57.881
I heard "partner," I thought "gay."
I heard "crash," I thought "lawsuit."

29:57.964 --> 30:00.425
I heard "Urgent Care,"
I thought, "This'll be quick."

30:00.508 --> 30:05.555
I got everything wrong.
No more snap judgments.

30:05.638 --> 30:08.141
So you're saying
you think I should take this one?

30:08.224 --> 30:13.021
Absolutely not.
I see that mattress, I think "bedbugs."

30:14.314 --> 30:16.316
Rock, that's great!

30:17.317 --> 30:18.735
There we go!

30:19.194 --> 30:21.863
All right, Rock, turn around.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.324
Big smile, big smile! Lots of energy.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.620
All right, eyes wide.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.164
That was perfect, that was perfect.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.670
Yo, dude, what's happenin'?

30:36.753 --> 30:38.338
-What's good, man?
-You're crushin' it.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.423
Dude, this is a dope shoot.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.759
What's gonna be on that green screen, yo?

30:42.842 --> 30:45.637
Like somethin' dirty or sexy or what?

30:45.720 --> 30:47.806
All right, let's keep that head down.

30:47.889 --> 30:51.434
I don't know, bro,
but this is a family scene.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.728
There's kids here.

30:55.855 --> 30:58.983
Big smile, big smile!
There we go!

30:59.067 --> 31:00.026
Excellent, Rock. Just like that.

31:00.110 --> 31:03.571
Dude, you better get outta here right now

31:03.655 --> 31:06.157
-before Rock sees you.
-All right, another one right here.

31:06.241 --> 31:09.411
Baby, there's just somethin' about
this whole situation

31:09.494 --> 31:11.246
that does not sit right with me.

31:11.329 --> 31:16.584
Could it be that I am the fun parent
and you are the heavy for a change?

31:18.962 --> 31:19.921
Maybe.

31:20.005 --> 31:22.173
-Look at that one right there!
-If you don't get outta here

31:22.257 --> 31:24.259
before that kid sees you,

31:24.342 --> 31:27.095
all trust will be broken

31:27.178 --> 31:30.015
and you will never be
"fun dad" ever again.

31:30.098 --> 31:32.225
-Good point.
-Here we are!

31:32.308 --> 31:34.436
-Later, dude.
-All right, big smile.

31:34.519 --> 31:36.396
I thought you were returning that hair.

31:36.479 --> 31:39.065
-Carrie likes it.
-Over your right shoulder, right shoulder.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.401
And I lost the receipt.

31:41.484 --> 31:43.445
-Peace out.
-There it is-- Hat off.

31:45.864 --> 31:47.741
Look away like you're too cool,
too cool for school.

31:50.493 --> 31:52.287
That's great, Rock. Just like that.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.083
That scene with the apron was funny.

31:57.167 --> 32:02.922
Okay. Wow, so we love, we loved Che's dad.

32:03.006 --> 32:06.760
Any other positive feedback
on the character played by Tony Danza?

32:07.469 --> 32:10.305
-Yeah.
-Great head of hair. So lush.

32:11.765 --> 32:12.766
Everybody loves Tony.

32:12.849 --> 32:15.477
Negatives about our dad character?

32:15.894 --> 32:19.898
He looked uncomfortable
in that scene when she cried.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.150
When "they," "they" cried.

32:22.817 --> 32:25.445
Right, sorry.

32:26.112 --> 32:29.741
The crying sends a signal
that it's sad to be non-binary.

32:30.241 --> 32:32.118
That is what I said!

32:32.202 --> 32:34.162
I knew the scene was too much
and I told 'em that.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.789
I told 'em that repeatedly.

32:35.872 --> 32:37.707
-Repeatedly.
-Okay. We have that note.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.292
You've been pretty quiet.

32:39.376 --> 32:41.044
Can we hear some more from you?

32:41.127 --> 32:42.170
Me?

32:43.713 --> 32:49.010
I mean, the whole "Che" character
was like a walking boomer joke

32:49.094 --> 32:50.720
that felt so fake to me.

32:51.513 --> 32:56.184
Just some phony, sanitized, performative,

32:56.267 --> 32:59.270
cheesy-ass, dad joke,

33:00.355 --> 33:04.984
bullshit version of what
the non-binary experience is.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.320
It sucked.

33:10.198 --> 33:13.910
Also, they would not be able to afford
an apartment that big in Bushwick.

33:15.870 --> 33:18.581
Did anyone else
have anything negative to say

33:18.665 --> 33:21.292
about the character of Che,
played by Che Diaz?

33:25.714 --> 33:27.799
Okay, looks like we got a Yahtzee.

33:29.634 --> 33:31.761
Everybody thinks of TV today

33:31.845 --> 33:34.889
as a place where artistic people
get to be creative.

33:34.973 --> 33:38.143
But the truth is,
they just care about selling soap.

33:38.226 --> 33:44.441
TV is just a corporate conglomerate,
and those corporate assholes can eat shit.

33:44.524 --> 33:47.444
It's just like corporate law.
They will never get it.

33:47.527 --> 33:50.572
And I'm sorry, Times Square tourists?

33:50.655 --> 33:53.033
They can't possibly understand your story.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.661
A genderqueer person
from Brooklyn tanked it.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.913
That call came from inside the house.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.957
Well, they can eat shit, too then.

34:01.041 --> 34:04.627
And ABC was like,
"If that demographic doesn't like Che--"

34:04.711 --> 34:07.756
ABC can eat shit!
ABC can eat shit and die!

34:07.839 --> 34:10.425
Stop telling everybody to eat shit.
It's not helping.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.509
Sorry.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.596
How am I gonna afford this apartment?

34:15.847 --> 34:17.724
I was counting on that TV money.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.518
Okay, so you'll make another show.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.481
You'll make an even better show.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.274
Yeah, doesn't work that way.

34:26.358 --> 34:30.527
You mean it didn't before now,
but you're you.

34:30.612 --> 34:32.906
There is nobody like you.

34:33.572 --> 34:38.453
You just have to suck it up
and pull yourself outta this.

34:38.536 --> 34:41.039
-I'll be your cheerleader.
-Oh, Miranda, stop.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.748
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Stop.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.835
-Miranda, stop. Stop, stop!
-Let's go!

34:45.918 --> 34:48.545
I don't need a cheerleader!
This isn't a game, this is my life!

34:48.630 --> 34:52.007
This is my career! This is my identity!

34:52.092 --> 34:54.219
It took me 46 years
to figure out who I am

34:54.302 --> 34:57.806
and then a focus group one hour
to fuckin' destroy me!

34:57.889 --> 35:00.141
So, I don't need to be
all Tony Robbins'd right now.

35:00.225 --> 35:01.267
I got it.

35:02.519 --> 35:03.395
So, what can I do?

35:03.478 --> 35:05.313
I don't-- Nothing.

35:06.022 --> 35:07.482
I'm a mess.

35:09.984 --> 35:11.695
I just need some space.

35:14.114 --> 35:16.324
Would you mind staying the night
at your other place?

35:18.785 --> 35:21.788
Sure. Of course.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.418
Can I hug you before I go?

35:37.512 --> 35:38.513
Okay.

35:40.765 --> 35:42.392
So, I'll see ya tomorrow.

35:42.851 --> 35:45.353
You know, honestly,
I think I just need a bit--

35:45.437 --> 35:48.064
a few more days alone.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.483
Is that okay?

35:51.359 --> 35:52.986
Yeah, sure.

36:21.389 --> 36:22.682
My...

36:27.604 --> 36:29.147
That was great.

36:42.369 --> 36:43.787
That's not cool.

36:45.997 --> 36:47.874
Are you for real right now?

36:49.918 --> 36:50.794
Sir,

36:50.877 --> 36:54.255
do you seriously have
the balls to say something about my device

36:54.339 --> 36:56.883
when I wake up to your freshly washed
penis pump

36:56.966 --> 36:59.052
-drying in my dish rack?
-That's different.

36:59.135 --> 37:00.929
That was just to get us started.
This is so like...

37:02.305 --> 37:03.348
So noisy.

37:04.182 --> 37:06.893
I'm sorry if I'm bothering the man
whose penis pump goes

37:07.977 --> 37:09.270
in the middle of my bedroom.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.446
Not cool.

37:20.490 --> 37:22.117
So not cool.

37:35.046 --> 37:36.297
Seriously?

37:37.090 --> 37:38.842
Not cool!

37:55.650 --> 37:56.526
Look at you.

37:58.236 --> 38:01.156
-Little help here?
-Sorry. No, I'm sorry.

38:02.157 --> 38:05.243
They're tiny tender buttons.

38:16.171 --> 38:20.383
Here wait one second.
That's probably Paul.

38:21.092 --> 38:22.302
I just need to get this.

38:22.385 --> 38:24.721
-Sure.
-Give me one second.

38:26.556 --> 38:29.351
-Dude, what is up?
-Dude, where's the final deck?

38:29.434 --> 38:31.436
I messengered it to you.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.564
I have no final deck.

38:34.647 --> 38:38.860
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck, I forgot to send it.

38:39.152 --> 38:43.823
I'm gonna call my assistant and have him
come pick it up ASAP, okay?

38:43.907 --> 38:45.909
-Are you with her right now?
-Yeah, I'm...

38:45.992 --> 38:49.037
-Seriously, dude?
-...with her, but that is not relevant.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.413
Hey, it's not not relevant!

38:50.497 --> 38:53.541
I will get this to you pronto,
and my head is totally in the game.

38:54.167 --> 38:55.335
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

38:55.418 --> 38:56.920
Goddammit!

38:57.003 --> 38:58.922
Just stop, all right?

38:59.005 --> 39:00.006
God.

39:04.969 --> 39:08.056
Look, it's nothing against you.

39:09.474 --> 39:10.892
Is it Carrie?

39:14.229 --> 39:15.855
Can you hear me?

39:15.939 --> 39:17.148
Yeah?

39:19.401 --> 39:22.487
Okay, I'm sorry about all this.

39:22.570 --> 39:26.616
Honestly, it's just--
it's been a few bumpy years.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.661
You know, he's creative and I'm business

39:29.744 --> 39:36.334
and sometimes I have to push
just to get him across that finish line

39:36.418 --> 39:37.544
which

39:38.336 --> 39:40.839
I guess it ends up making me look like
the bad guy

39:40.922 --> 39:43.925
and a piece of shit, and I'm not.

39:44.426 --> 39:48.555
I've been in this game
for 20-something years now

39:48.638 --> 39:52.100
and you know,
I feel like he's been just, kind of,

39:52.183 --> 39:56.354
falling off a little bit, like,
"Oh, you know, I'm just gonna give 70%,"

39:56.438 --> 39:59.065
like, that's cool. It's not fucking cool.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.277
I'm fucking frustrated, Carrie.

40:02.736 --> 40:03.945
George?

40:09.284 --> 40:12.037
-George?
-Be right there!

40:12.120 --> 40:14.080
Just gotta get this deck together!

40:15.623 --> 40:16.833
Hey.

40:17.417 --> 40:22.756
Hey, listen, I'm gonna go!
He's upset.

40:22.839 --> 40:25.383
Paul's great.
I don't want you to think he's a jerk.

40:25.467 --> 40:29.929
It's just this sale's a big deal for us,
and it's stressful as hell.

40:31.431 --> 40:34.851
You know how on your form
I checked "single"?

40:35.810 --> 40:38.438
Well, I think you actually are married

40:39.439 --> 40:41.024
to Paul.

40:41.107 --> 40:44.277
He's not just your business partner,
he's your wife.

40:44.361 --> 40:48.531
No, no, it's not like that.
We're more Lennon and McCartney.

40:49.866 --> 40:55.497
Well, that kinda makes me Yoko,
so, I'm gonna go.

40:56.289 --> 41:00.251
-You sure?
-Yep! Leaving!

41:00.335 --> 41:04.339
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

41:16.101 --> 41:17.018
Carrie?

41:25.819 --> 41:29.864
And just like that,
George and I were over.

41:29.948 --> 41:33.284
But at least I got back up on the bike.
