00:03.834 --> 00:07.041
(<i> rooster crows</i> )

00:08.291 --> 00:10.166
Brother John Bates,

00:10.208 --> 00:14.291
is that not the morning

00:10.208 --> 00:14.291
which breaks yonder?

00:14.333 --> 00:16.250
I think it be.

00:16.291 --> 00:18.875
But we have

00:16.291 --> 00:18.875
no great cause

00:18.917 --> 00:22.166
to desire

00:18.917 --> 00:22.166
the approach of day.

00:22.208 --> 00:23.667
(<i> rooster crows</i> )

00:25.333 --> 00:26.667
Who's there?!

00:26.709 --> 00:27.959
A friend.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.250
Under what Captain

00:28.000 --> 00:30.250
serve you?

00:30.291 --> 00:32.667
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

00:36.333 --> 00:39.041
I pray you

00:39.083 --> 00:42.083
what thinks he

00:39.083 --> 00:42.083
of our estate?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.834
Even as men wrecked upon a sand

00:43.875 --> 00:46.458
that look to be washed off

00:43.875 --> 00:46.458
at the next tide.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.583
He hath not told

00:46.500 --> 00:48.583
his thought to the king?

00:48.625 --> 00:51.875
No.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.875
Nor it is not meet he should.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.125
For though I speak it to you

00:54.166 --> 00:59.417
I think the king is...

00:54.166 --> 00:59.417
but a man, as I am.

00:59.458 --> 01:02.375
The violet

00:59.458 --> 01:02.375
smells to him

01:02.417 --> 01:04.208
as it doth to me.

01:04.250 --> 01:07.709
In his nakedness,

01:04.250 --> 01:07.709
he appears but a man.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.417
Therefore his fears,

01:07.750 --> 01:11.417
out of doubt

01:11.458 --> 01:14.917
be of the same

01:11.458 --> 01:14.917
relish as ours are.

01:14.959 --> 01:18.333
Yet, no man should possess him

01:14.959 --> 01:18.333
with any appearance of fear

01:18.375 --> 01:21.667
lest he, by showing it,

01:18.375 --> 01:21.667
should dishearten his army.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.166
He may show

01:21.709 --> 01:23.166
what outward courage he will

01:23.208 --> 01:25.792
but I believe,

01:23.208 --> 01:25.792
as cold a night as 'tis

01:25.834 --> 01:28.000
he could wish himself in Thames

01:25.834 --> 01:28.000
up to the neck.

01:28.041 --> 01:31.750
Methinks I could not

01:28.041 --> 01:31.750
die anyplace so contented

01:31.792 --> 01:34.542
as in the king's company.

01:34.583 --> 01:36.709
His cause being just

01:36.750 --> 01:38.333
and his quarrel honorable.

01:38.375 --> 01:39.959
That's more than we know.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.250
Or more than we

01:40.000 --> 01:42.250
should seek after.

01:42.291 --> 01:44.041
If his cause be wrong,

01:44.083 --> 01:47.250
our obedience to the king

01:44.083 --> 01:47.250
wipes the crime of it out of us.

01:47.291 --> 01:49.333
But if the cause be not good,

01:49.375 --> 01:52.417
the king, himself, have

01:49.375 --> 01:52.417
a heavy reckoning to make

01:52.458 --> 01:55.166
when all those legs and arms and

01:52.458 --> 01:55.166
heads chopped off in a battle

01:55.208 --> 01:58.417
shall join together

01:55.208 --> 01:58.417
at the latter day and cry all

01:58.458 --> 02:00.083
"We died at such a place."

02:00.125 --> 02:01.709
The king is not bound to answer

02:01.750 --> 02:03.792
the particular endings

02:01.750 --> 02:03.792
of his soldiers,

02:03.834 --> 02:05.000
the father of his son,

02:05.041 --> 02:06.750
nor the master

02:05.041 --> 02:06.750
of his servant.

02:06.792 --> 02:09.083
Splendid, Data, splendid.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.709
You're getting

02:09.125 --> 02:10.709
better and better.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.792
Freeze program.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.041
Thank you, sir.

02:18.083 --> 02:21.709
I plan to study

02:18.083 --> 02:21.709
the performances

02:18.083 --> 02:21.709
of Olivier,

02:21.750 --> 02:23.709
Branagh, Shapiro

02:21.750 --> 02:23.709
and Kullnark.

02:23.750 --> 02:24.625
Data...

02:24.667 --> 02:25.709
(<i> sighs</i> )

02:25.750 --> 02:27.375
You're here to learn

02:27.417 --> 02:29.500
about the human condition.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.834
And there is no better way

02:29.542 --> 02:31.834
of doing that

02:31.875 --> 02:34.709
than by embracing Shakespeare.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.709
But... you must discover it

02:34.750 --> 02:37.709
through your own performance,

02:37.750 --> 02:40.083
not by imitating others.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.709
Riker to Picard.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.709
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.083
Go ahead, Number One.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.667
Sensors are picking up

02:44.709 --> 02:47.083
a unidentified craft

02:44.709 --> 02:47.083
in the Neutral Zone.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.417
It's heading toward

02:47.125 --> 02:49.417
Federation space.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.125
We're on our way.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.125
Picard out.

02:51.166 --> 02:55.417
We'll get to the rest of the act

02:51.166 --> 02:55.417
another time, Data.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.417
Computer, file program

02:55.458 --> 02:57.417
and clear.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.792
Captain, why should a king

03:01.834 --> 03:03.667
wish to pass

03:01.834 --> 03:03.667
as a commoner?

03:03.709 --> 03:04.750
If he is the leader,

03:04.792 --> 03:06.458
should he not

03:04.792 --> 03:06.458
be leading?

03:06.500 --> 03:08.083
Listen to what

03:06.500 --> 03:08.083
Shakespeare

03:08.125 --> 03:10.667
is telling you

03:08.125 --> 03:10.667
about the man, Data.

03:10.709 --> 03:14.166
A king who had true

03:10.709 --> 03:14.166
feeling for his soldiers

03:14.208 --> 03:16.625
would wish to share

03:14.208 --> 03:16.625
their fears with them

03:16.667 --> 03:18.625
on the eve of battle.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.542
Sir, will I be able

03:18.667 --> 03:20.542
to schedule

03:20.583 --> 03:23.291
a performance for the crew

03:20.583 --> 03:23.291
in the near future?

03:23.333 --> 03:26.208
Let's not rush

03:23.333 --> 03:26.208
it, shall we?

03:26.250 --> 03:27.625
Hmm.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.667
Outpost Sierra VI

03:35.125 --> 03:37.667
confirms our readings, sir.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.750
They identify it

03:37.709 --> 03:39.750
as a Romulan scoutship.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.625
Bearing: 270 mark 14.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.583
Scoutship.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.000
What would a scoutship be doing

03:43.625 --> 03:46.000
this far into the Neutral Zone?

03:46.041 --> 03:47.792
Captain, shall

03:46.041 --> 03:47.792
we transmit

03:47.834 --> 03:49.166
a warning to withdraw, sir?

03:49.208 --> 03:50.667
Open a hailing frequency.

03:50.709 --> 03:52.041
Aye, sir.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.667
Captain, the Romulan

03:52.083 --> 03:54.667
is hailing us.

03:54.709 --> 03:56.041
Visual.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.667
Not within

03:56.083 --> 03:57.667
range, yet.

03:57.709 --> 03:59.208
Open a channel.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.458
Federation ship,

03:59.250 --> 04:01.458
do you read?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.458
I require urgent assistance.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.625
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

04:03.500 --> 04:06.625
of the USS...

04:06.667 --> 04:09.041
Federation ship,

04:06.667 --> 04:09.041
please help me.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.417
Requesting asylum.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.667
Under pursuit.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.208
Pursuit?

04:13.250 --> 04:14.625
Visual range.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.041
On screen, Captain.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.875
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:55.917 --> 04:59.917
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:55.917 --> 04:59.917
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.792
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

05:01.834 --> 05:05.792
<i>to explore</i>

05:01.834 --> 05:05.792
<i>strange new worlds</i>

05:05.834 --> 05:10.333
<i>to seek out new life</i>

05:05.834 --> 05:10.333
<i>and new civilizations</i>

05:10.375 --> 05:14.792
<i>to boldly go</i>

05:10.375 --> 05:14.792
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

06:17.417 --> 06:18.667
Red Alert.

06:18.709 --> 06:20.083
Open a channel to the warship.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.166
Come to intercept course.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.458
Keep us out

06:21.208 --> 06:22.458
of the Neutral Zone.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.083
Channel is open.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.500
How long before they cross over

06:24.125 --> 06:26.500
into Federation territory?

06:26.542 --> 06:27.834
41 seconds, sir.

06:27.875 --> 06:28.834
Romulan warbird,

06:28.875 --> 06:30.333
this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

06:30.375 --> 06:32.709
of the Federation vessel

06:30.375 --> 06:32.709
<i>Enterprise.</i>

06:32.750 --> 06:34.834
You have crossed

06:32.750 --> 06:34.834
into the Neutral Zone

06:34.875 --> 06:37.083
and are engaged

06:34.875 --> 06:37.083
in hostile action.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.500
Explain yourself

06:37.125 --> 06:39.500
and your intent.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.750
No reply, sir.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.166
Hail the scout.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.709
Responding.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.125
On screen.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.583
Federation craft...

06:47.625 --> 06:50.333
please, you must help me!

06:50.375 --> 06:52.417
We are moving to intercept.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.333
Maintain your course and power.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.208
The scoutship

06:58.917 --> 07:01.208
is severely damaged, sir.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.458
Engines inoperative,

07:01.250 --> 07:03.458
shields are down.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.875
Position?

07:04.917 --> 07:07.291
Coordinates 140 by 205, sir.

07:07.333 --> 07:08.667
Federation space.

07:08.709 --> 07:10.250
Right. Move to within

07:08.709 --> 07:10.250
five kilometers.

07:10.291 --> 07:13.625
Mr. La Forge,

07:10.291 --> 07:13.625
prepare to extend

07:13.667 --> 07:15.250
our shields

07:13.667 --> 07:15.250
around the Romulan scoutship.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.166
At that range, the shields

07:15.291 --> 07:17.166
won't be able to take

07:17.208 --> 07:18.417
much punishment, Captain.

07:18.458 --> 07:19.834
Five kilometers, sir.

07:19.875 --> 07:21.458
All stop.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.959
Extend shields.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.417
LA FORGE:

07:23.000 --> 07:24.417
Shields in place.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.709
We've got the scoutship,

07:24.458 --> 07:26.709
Captain.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.000
The weapons on

07:36.583 --> 07:39.000
the warbird are

07:36.583 --> 07:39.000
fully powered, sir.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.250
Lock phasers.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.250
Open a channel.

07:41.291 --> 07:42.417
Ready.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.750
Romulan vessel

07:43.792 --> 07:46.041
you are now

07:43.792 --> 07:46.041
in Federation territory.

07:46.083 --> 07:49.000
Unless you withdraw...

07:49.041 --> 07:51.375
No argument?

07:51.417 --> 07:54.917
Warbird has re-entered

07:51.417 --> 07:54.917
the Neutral Zone.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.875
Heading

07:54.959 --> 07:56.875
toward Romulan territory.

07:56.917 --> 07:59.959
Massive power failure

07:56.917 --> 07:59.959
to the scoutship, sir.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.417
All systems are

08:00.041 --> 08:01.417
going off-line

08:01.458 --> 08:02.709
including

08:01.458 --> 08:02.709
life-support.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.208
Transporter 2,

08:02.750 --> 08:04.208
prepare to beam

08:04.250 --> 08:06.750
the occupant of the scoutship

08:04.250 --> 08:06.750
directly aboard.

08:06.792 --> 08:07.750
Aye, sir.

08:07.792 --> 08:08.917
Mr. Worf.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.750
Mr. Data,

08:08.959 --> 08:11.750
lock onto the scoutship.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.750
Take it in tow.

08:16.709 --> 08:17.959
Energize.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.667
I must see your Captain

08:32.750 --> 08:34.667
immediately.

08:34.709 --> 08:36.291
We'll get you

08:34.709 --> 08:36.291
to Sick Bay.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.250
After that...

08:37.291 --> 08:38.709
This cannot wait!

08:38.750 --> 08:41.959
I have information

08:38.750 --> 08:41.959
vital to your survival.

08:45.750 --> 08:49.834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

08:45.750 --> 08:49.834
<i>Stardate 43462.5.</i>

08:49.875 --> 08:53.041
<i>We have beamed aboard</i>

08:49.875 --> 08:53.041
<i>an apparent Romulan defector</i>

08:53.083 --> 08:56.333
<i>who claims to be a low-ranking</i>

08:53.083 --> 08:56.333
<i>logistics officer</i>

08:56.375 --> 09:00.166
<i>with extraordinary information</i>

08:56.375 --> 09:00.166
<i>about a secret offensive.</i>

09:00.208 --> 09:02.625
The humiliating defeat

09:00.208 --> 09:02.625
at the battle of Cheron

09:02.667 --> 09:04.208
has<i> not</i> been forgotten.

09:04.250 --> 09:07.375
The new leaders have vowed

09:04.250 --> 09:07.375
to disregard the treaty

09:07.417 --> 09:09.208
and claim the

09:07.417 --> 09:09.208
Neutral Zone.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.458
Nelvana III is just

09:09.250 --> 09:11.458
the first step.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.917
You're saying an entire base

09:12.959 --> 09:14.625
has already been

09:12.959 --> 09:14.625
established there?

09:14.667 --> 09:18.417
Within 48 hours,

09:14.667 --> 09:18.417
the reactor core

09:14.667 --> 09:18.417
will be on-line.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.959
So the Federation sensors

09:18.458 --> 09:21.959
that monitor the Neutral Zone

09:22.000 --> 09:23.333
just missed it.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.834
It would seem so.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.959
In two days

09:29.000 --> 09:32.417
a fleet of Romulan warbirds

09:32.458 --> 09:35.291
will be within

09:32.458 --> 09:35.291
striking distance

09:35.333 --> 09:37.166
of 15 Federation sectors.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.041
The Federation

09:37.208 --> 09:39.041
will not permit that.

09:39.083 --> 09:43.542
Then it<i> is</i> war that we're

09:39.083 --> 09:43.542
talking about, isn't it?

09:45.208 --> 09:50.291
Destroy the base now

09:45.208 --> 09:50.291
and the threat is over.

09:50.333 --> 09:54.125
Well, I'm sure you are fatigued

09:50.333 --> 09:54.125
by your ordeal

09:54.166 --> 09:56.000
and you require

09:54.166 --> 09:56.000
medical attention.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.458
Lieutenant Worf

09:57.500 --> 10:00.208
will you conduct Sublieutenant

09:57.500 --> 10:00.208
Setal to the Sick Bay?

10:00.250 --> 10:03.208
We will attend

10:00.250 --> 10:03.208
to your quarters.

10:03.250 --> 10:06.500
No doubt you will wish

10:03.250 --> 10:06.500
to question me further.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.834
No doubt.

10:22.542 --> 10:24.041
He tells a hell of a story.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.625
You don't

10:24.083 --> 10:25.625
believe it?

10:25.667 --> 10:28.208
Well, the Empire knows

10:25.667 --> 10:28.208
that we would never allow them

10:28.250 --> 10:30.041
to build a base

10:28.250 --> 10:30.041
within the Neutral Zone.

10:30.083 --> 10:33.458
Commander, that would not be

10:30.083 --> 10:33.458
an atypical Romulan ploy.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.291
In their long

10:33.500 --> 10:35.291
history of war

10:35.333 --> 10:37.417
the Romulans have

10:35.333 --> 10:37.417
rarely attacked first.

10:37.458 --> 10:40.250
They prefer to test

10:37.458 --> 10:40.250
their enemy's resolve.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.750
RIKER:

10:40.291 --> 10:41.750
I think he's a plant

10:41.792 --> 10:43.542
to draw us

10:41.792 --> 10:43.542
into the Neutral Zone.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.667
That way, we look like

10:43.583 --> 10:45.667
the aggressors.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.250
And the Romulans would have

10:47.291 --> 10:49.667
a legitimate excuse

10:47.291 --> 10:49.667
for responding in force.

10:49.709 --> 10:50.667
Exactly.

10:50.709 --> 10:51.834
DATA:

10:50.709 --> 10:51.834
That would also

10:51.875 --> 10:53.750
not be an atypical

10:51.875 --> 10:53.750
Romulan ploy, sir.

10:53.792 --> 10:57.625
It's always a game

10:53.792 --> 10:57.625
of chess with

10:53.792 --> 10:57.625
them, isn't it?

10:57.667 --> 10:59.625
Well, at least

10:57.667 --> 10:59.625
he's given us

10:59.667 --> 11:01.125
a chance to get a look

11:01.166 --> 11:03.333
at some Romulan

11:01.166 --> 11:03.333
technology close-up.

11:03.375 --> 11:06.417
Mr. La Forge, you will

11:03.375 --> 11:06.417
lead the away team

11:03.375 --> 11:06.417
over to the scout.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.709
Commander, you

11:06.458 --> 11:08.709
and Counselor Troi

11:08.750 --> 11:10.667
will conduct Setal's

11:08.750 --> 11:10.667
interrogation.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.083
Captain, permission to

11:10.709 --> 11:13.083
observe the interrogation.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.834
No, Mr. Data.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.333
I need you

11:14.875 --> 11:17.333
on the bridge with me.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.333
There is much to be done.

11:17.375 --> 11:20.709
We have less than 48 hours

11:17.375 --> 11:20.709
to prevent a war

11:20.750 --> 11:23.041
or, perhaps...

11:23.083 --> 11:25.291
to start one.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.208
This will depend

11:25.333 --> 11:28.208
on establishing the truth...

11:35.250 --> 11:37.542
I set

11:35.250 --> 11:37.542
the autodestruct sequencer

11:37.583 --> 11:39.542
before I left the ship.

11:39.583 --> 11:40.542
Why?

11:40.583 --> 11:42.083
Wouldn't you?

11:42.125 --> 11:45.500
To prevent your ship

11:42.125 --> 11:45.500
from being captured?

11:45.542 --> 11:47.291
Excuse me for being

11:45.542 --> 11:47.291
a little confused, Setal

11:47.333 --> 11:48.500
but I thought

11:47.333 --> 11:48.500
you were defecting.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.500
I am not a traitor.

11:51.542 --> 11:57.166
All you can see is

11:51.542 --> 11:57.166
the opportunity to exploit me.

11:57.208 --> 12:00.625
The Federation credo--

11:57.208 --> 12:00.625
exploitation!

12:00.667 --> 12:03.208
Oh, you couldn't get aboard

12:00.667 --> 12:03.208
my ship fast enough, hmm?

12:03.250 --> 12:06.291
Strip it down.

12:06.333 --> 12:10.542
"What secrets might it reveal

12:06.333 --> 12:10.542
that we can use?"

12:10.583 --> 12:13.125
You're shortsighted people.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.000
Can't you understand?

12:15.041 --> 12:16.875
I came to stop a war.

12:16.917 --> 12:20.750
If you could

12:16.917 --> 12:20.750
just hold still.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.208
With your metabolism

12:24.250 --> 12:27.250
this will heal

12:24.250 --> 12:27.250
in a few moments.

12:32.917 --> 12:35.333
Thank you, Doctor.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.625
How fortunate

12:36.667 --> 12:39.333
that you know something

12:36.667 --> 12:39.333
of Romulan medicine.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.875
Yes, I had a chance to gain

12:41.917 --> 12:43.917
some experience

12:41.917 --> 12:43.917
recently.

12:43.959 --> 12:45.125
Oh, yes.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.291
The incident at

12:45.166 --> 12:47.291
the Galorndon Core.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.000
The two officers.

12:49.041 --> 12:53.375
You are aware of a great deal

12:49.041 --> 12:53.375
for a logistics<i> clerk.</i>

12:55.291 --> 12:58.333
It was common knowledge.

12:58.375 --> 13:02.000
I could show you

12:58.375 --> 13:02.000
my rating code.

13:02.041 --> 13:06.041
Forged credentials are

13:02.041 --> 13:06.041
a simple matter for a spy.

13:06.083 --> 13:10.250
How do you allow

13:06.083 --> 13:10.250
Klingon<i> pahtk</i>

13:10.291 --> 13:14.291
to walk around

13:10.291 --> 13:14.291
in a Starfleet uniform?

13:14.333 --> 13:17.792
You are lucky

13:14.333 --> 13:17.792
this is not a Klingon ship.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.667
We know how to

13:17.834 --> 13:19.667
deal with spies.

13:19.709 --> 13:22.000
Remove this<i> tohzah</i>

13:19.709 --> 13:22.000
from my sight.

13:22.041 --> 13:25.959
Your knowledge

13:22.041 --> 13:25.959
of Klingon curses

13:22.041 --> 13:25.959
is impressive,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.625
but, as a Romulan might say,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.625
only a<i> veruul</i> would use

13:29.667 --> 13:31.250
such language

13:29.667 --> 13:31.250
in public.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.750
Mr. Worf please see

13:31.291 --> 13:34.750
to the security arrangements

13:34.792 --> 13:36.834
for our guest's stay.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.583
Aye, sir.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.792
(<i> laughs</i> )

13:43.834 --> 13:47.000
You find something

13:43.834 --> 13:47.000
amusing?

13:47.041 --> 13:49.208
Lieutenant Worf--

13:47.041 --> 13:49.208
I like him.

13:49.250 --> 13:52.417
To be more accurate,

13:49.250 --> 13:52.417
I understand him--

13:52.458 --> 13:54.333
a warrior, proud,

13:54.375 --> 13:58.667
fearless, living only

13:54.375 --> 13:58.667
for combat.

13:58.709 --> 14:01.709
Exactly the type

13:58.709 --> 14:01.709
that will get us all killed

14:01.750 --> 14:04.750
if we're not careful.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.041
This is the

14:17.583 --> 14:20.041
food station.

14:20.083 --> 14:23.250
You can reach me

14:20.083 --> 14:23.250
through the com panel.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.041
Later, we would like

14:25.083 --> 14:27.625
to ask you

14:25.083 --> 14:27.625
a few more questions.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.667
Computer, water.

14:33.709 --> 14:35.083
Temperature?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.750
12 onkians.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.625
This system is calibrated

14:36.792 --> 14:40.625
to the Celsius metric system.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.208
Any temperature at all

14:42.250 --> 14:44.959
on the cold side

14:42.250 --> 14:44.959
of whatever your system is.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.500
(<i> food station beeping</i> )

15:21.667 --> 15:23.750
DATA:

15:21.667 --> 15:23.750
There is no

15:21.667 --> 15:23.750
unusual activity

15:23.792 --> 15:25.750
in the Nelvana

15:23.792 --> 15:25.750
system, sir.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.709
Let's isolate

15:25.792 --> 15:29.709
and magnify that system.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.375
Nothing on

15:29.750 --> 15:32.375
the sensors.

15:34.917 --> 15:39.542
It's hard to believe

15:34.917 --> 15:39.542
in what one cannot see,

15:39.583 --> 15:42.750
and yet, conceivably

15:42.792 --> 15:44.709
with their

15:42.792 --> 15:44.709
cloaking technology

15:44.750 --> 15:46.458
a fleet

15:44.750 --> 15:46.458
of Romulan warbirds

15:46.500 --> 15:49.458
could be passing

15:46.500 --> 15:49.458
before our eyes.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.083
There must be some way

15:49.500 --> 15:53.083
to neutralize this advantage.

15:53.125 --> 15:57.083
COMPUTER:

15:53.125 --> 15:57.083
Captain Picard, priority one

15:53.125 --> 15:57.083
message from Starfleet

15:57.125 --> 15:59.208
coming in on secured channel.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.875
In my ready room.

16:00.917 --> 16:02.417
Computer, delay time?

16:02.458 --> 16:05.291
Two hours, 22 minute delay

16:02.458 --> 16:05.291
from time of transmission

16:05.333 --> 16:08.083
at Starfleet Command on Lya III.

16:12.208 --> 16:15.709
Computer, key access

16:12.208 --> 16:15.709
412 mark 80.

16:15.750 --> 16:16.959
Picard, Jean-Luc.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.208
Starfleet priority code Gamma.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.542
Decode.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.792
Begin message.

16:22.834 --> 16:25.250
Captain, we have received

16:22.834 --> 16:25.250
an official protest

16:25.291 --> 16:26.917
from the Romulan Empire

16:26.959 --> 16:29.458
demanding the return

16:26.959 --> 16:29.458
of your defector.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.625
Obviously, we are

16:29.500 --> 16:32.625
refusing to comply.

16:32.667 --> 16:36.500
I join in your skepticism,

16:32.667 --> 16:36.500
but if it is a deception

16:36.542 --> 16:40.375
the Romulans are certainly

16:36.542 --> 16:40.375
making a good show of it.

16:40.417 --> 16:44.333
The Federation Council has

16:40.417 --> 16:44.333
convened an emergency session.

16:44.375 --> 16:48.291
There is no doubt in my mind

16:48.333 --> 16:51.583
that this will eventually fall

16:48.333 --> 16:51.583
on your shoulders, Jean-Luc.

16:51.625 --> 16:52.875
You've got him.

16:52.917 --> 16:55.417
You must decide

16:52.917 --> 16:55.417
if he's telling the truth.

16:55.458 --> 17:00.000
For now, I suggest you proceed

16:55.458 --> 17:00.000
along the Neutral Zone border

17:00.041 --> 17:04.083
toward a Federation position

17:00.041 --> 17:04.083
proximate to Nelvana III.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.458
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.875
Yes, Captain.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.333
Please come to my ready room.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.667
Aye, sir.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.667
On my way.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.250
LA FORGE:

17:22.041 --> 17:24.250
Slow playback.

17:24.291 --> 17:28.166
Display engine logs

17:24.291 --> 17:28.166
and power data

17:24.291 --> 17:28.166
for both vessels.

17:28.208 --> 17:32.000
Now, watch what happens

17:28.208 --> 17:32.000
at 095433 on the clock.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.083
The scout has sustained

17:32.041 --> 17:34.083
engine damage

17:34.125 --> 17:36.208
forcing him to slow

17:34.125 --> 17:36.208
to .615 impulse power.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.583
The warship should overtake

17:36.250 --> 17:39.583
him, but it doesn't.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.125
Now, just 2.6 seconds later,

17:41.166 --> 17:44.625
the warship slows

17:41.166 --> 17:44.625
to precisely the same speed.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.375
Three times, three

17:44.667 --> 17:46.375
speed fluctuations.

17:46.417 --> 17:49.291
The warship kept its

17:46.417 --> 17:49.291
distance every time.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.166
I don't think they

17:49.333 --> 17:51.166
wanted to catch up.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.750
And yet they fired

17:51.208 --> 17:52.750
on the scoutship.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.709
They could have

17:52.792 --> 17:54.709
killed him.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.083
Not necessarily, Doctor.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.125
The Romulans have

17:56.125 --> 17:58.125
the same capability

17:58.166 --> 18:00.417
to direct the impact

17:58.166 --> 18:00.417
of their weapons as we do.

18:00.458 --> 18:03.083
Hmm. Is there

18:00.458 --> 18:03.083
a possibility

18:03.125 --> 18:06.458
the wound could be

18:03.125 --> 18:06.458
self-inflicted?

18:06.500 --> 18:10.417
They're very bad burns.

18:06.500 --> 18:10.417
I hardly think...

18:10.458 --> 18:12.583
A possibility.

18:14.375 --> 18:15.500
Yes.

18:15.542 --> 18:19.834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

18:15.542 --> 18:19.834
<i>Stardate 43463.7.</i>

18:19.875 --> 18:22.792
<i>We are holding a position</i>

18:19.875 --> 18:22.792
<i>at the Neutral Zone border</i>

18:22.834 --> 18:24.583
<i>proximate to Nelvana III.</i>

18:24.625 --> 18:27.709
<i>If our guest is telling the</i>

18:24.625 --> 18:27.709
<i>truth, there are 21 hours left</i>

18:27.750 --> 18:30.917
<i>before the Romulan base</i>

18:27.750 --> 18:30.917
<i>becomes functional.</i>

18:30.959 --> 18:33.750
The<i> Monitor</i> and the<i> Hood</i>

18:30.959 --> 18:33.750
are headed in your direction,

18:33.792 --> 18:36.333
but they will arrive too late

18:33.792 --> 18:36.333
to be of assistance.

18:36.375 --> 18:39.959
Warnings have gone out

18:36.375 --> 18:39.959
to all outposts along the border

18:40.000 --> 18:42.667
as well as several independent

18:40.000 --> 18:42.667
vessels in nearby sectors.

18:42.709 --> 18:45.041
No one here wants a war,

18:42.709 --> 18:45.041
Captain,

18:45.083 --> 18:47.291
but we are prepared

18:45.083 --> 18:47.291
to take them on

18:47.333 --> 18:48.834
if that is what they want.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.458
All Federation starships

18:50.500 --> 18:52.959
have been placed

18:50.500 --> 18:52.959
on Yellow Alert.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.417
(<i> door chimes</i> )

18:54.458 --> 18:56.083
Come.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.375
You wanted to

18:56.125 --> 18:59.375
see me, Captain?

18:59.417 --> 19:02.583
Yes, Data, I want you

18:59.417 --> 19:02.583
to prepare a class-1 probe.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.792
Set the sensors

19:02.625 --> 19:04.792
for maximum scan.

19:04.834 --> 19:07.959
I want every meter

19:04.834 --> 19:07.959
of Nelvana III monitored.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.583
I will start my calibrations,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.583
sir.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.709
Data...

19:14.834 --> 19:18.166
Is there something else

19:14.834 --> 19:18.166
you require of me, Captain?

19:18.208 --> 19:21.417
Your clarity of thought.

19:21.458 --> 19:25.625
Your objectivity, as always.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.125
Sit down.

19:30.959 --> 19:35.667
Data, it's very possible

19:30.959 --> 19:35.667
that we are about to go to war.

19:35.709 --> 19:40.000
The repercussions of what we do

19:35.709 --> 19:40.000
during the next 24 hours

19:40.041 --> 19:41.375
may be felt for years to come.

19:41.417 --> 19:45.750
I want you to keep a record

19:41.417 --> 19:45.750
of these events

19:45.792 --> 19:48.417
so that history

19:45.792 --> 19:48.417
will have the benefit

19:48.458 --> 19:51.583
of... a dispassionate view.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.041
I will begin immediately, sir.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.750
Is that all?

19:54.792 --> 19:57.083
How is the crew's spirit?

19:57.125 --> 19:58.750
They are

19:57.125 --> 19:58.750
concerned,

19:58.792 --> 20:01.458
of course, Captain,

19:58.792 --> 20:01.458
but confident.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.959
Do you not see that, sir?

20:05.875 --> 20:07.959
Data, unlike King Henry,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.709
it is not easy for me

20:08.000 --> 20:10.709
to disguise myself

20:10.750 --> 20:14.041
and walk among my troops.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.792
That'll be all.

20:28.375 --> 20:31.625
"Now if these men

20:28.375 --> 20:31.625
do not die well

20:31.667 --> 20:35.500
"it will be a black matter

20:31.667 --> 20:35.500
for the king

20:35.542 --> 20:37.542
who led them to it."

20:41.166 --> 20:43.583
Why must we waste time

20:41.166 --> 20:43.583
playing this ridiculous game?

20:43.625 --> 20:45.500
There's more here than

20:43.625 --> 20:45.500
you're telling us.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.125
You're forcing yourself

20:45.542 --> 20:47.125
to hold back.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.417
I have told you

20:47.166 --> 20:49.417
everything relevant

20:49.458 --> 20:50.792
about Nelvana III.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.166
I'm not talking

20:50.834 --> 20:52.166
about the base.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.208
The base is all that matters.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.750
You're lying, Setal.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.709
Go to Nelvana III

20:55.792 --> 20:57.709
and you will see.

20:57.750 --> 21:00.000
We're not going anywhere

20:57.750 --> 21:00.000
until we get to the truth.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.083
You're a spy, aren't you?

21:01.125 --> 21:02.041
No.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.709
Then prove it.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.583
You can begin by telling me

21:03.750 --> 21:05.583
something about the location

21:05.625 --> 21:07.083
and the strength

21:05.625 --> 21:07.083
of the Romulan fleet.

21:07.125 --> 21:08.041
I don't know it.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.291
You're a logistics officer.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.709
For one sector only.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.417
Who was your superior officer?

21:10.750 --> 21:12.417
Admiral Jarok.

21:12.458 --> 21:13.875
The location

21:12.458 --> 21:13.875
of the Romulan bases

21:13.917 --> 21:14.875
along the Neutral Zone?

21:14.917 --> 21:15.917
I don't know.

21:15.959 --> 21:17.500
In your sector?

21:15.959 --> 21:17.500
Irrelevant!

21:17.542 --> 21:19.250
The number of troops

21:17.542 --> 21:19.250
under your admiral's command?

21:19.291 --> 21:22.250
Irrelevant! Irrelevant!

21:25.667 --> 21:27.333
I guess you're right.

21:27.375 --> 21:30.333
It's not worth

21:27.375 --> 21:30.333
playing this game.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.917
Oh, what a fool I've been--

21:32.959 --> 21:38.375
to come looking for courage

21:32.959 --> 21:38.375
in the lair of cowards.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.500
COMPUTER:

21:44.000 --> 21:46.500
Captain Picard, priority message

21:46.542 --> 21:49.250
from Security Officer,

21:46.542 --> 21:49.250
Klingon vessel<i> Bortas.</i>

21:49.291 --> 21:52.792
Mr. Worf, will you handle this

21:49.291 --> 21:52.792
at security station, deck nine?

21:52.834 --> 21:54.583
Aye, sir.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.917
Sensors are configured

21:54.625 --> 21:57.917
for planetary probe, sir.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.417
Ready for launch.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.083
Proceed.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.291
Probe on course.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.834
Sensors are functioning.

22:10.875 --> 22:13.792
Coordinate your analysis

22:10.875 --> 22:13.792
with Mr. La Forge.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.208
I want this report

22:13.834 --> 22:16.208
with dispatch.

22:20.458 --> 22:21.667
I don't know, Data.

22:21.709 --> 22:23.375
My gut tells me

22:21.709 --> 22:23.375
we ought to be listening

22:23.417 --> 22:25.375
to what this guy's

22:23.417 --> 22:25.375
trying to tell us.

22:25.417 --> 22:26.583
Your "gut"?

22:26.625 --> 22:28.875
It's just a...

22:26.625 --> 22:28.875
a feeling, you know--

22:28.917 --> 22:30.542
an instinct, intuition.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.583
But those qualities

22:30.583 --> 22:32.583
would interfere

22:32.625 --> 22:34.750
with rational judgment,

22:32.625 --> 22:34.750
would they not?

22:34.792 --> 22:36.542
You're right,

22:34.792 --> 22:36.542
sometimes they do.

22:36.583 --> 22:40.041
Then why not rely strictly

22:36.583 --> 22:40.041
on the facts?

22:40.083 --> 22:43.041
Because you just can't rely

22:40.083 --> 22:43.041
on the plain and simple facts.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.750
Sometimes they lie.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.625
They can lead

22:46.667 --> 22:48.625
to the wrong conclusions,

22:48.667 --> 22:50.750
but they cannot lie.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.709
Yeah? Well, what

22:50.792 --> 22:52.709
do you think?

22:52.750 --> 22:54.583
Is he a defector or not?

22:54.625 --> 22:56.000
The facts to date would lead

22:56.041 --> 22:58.041
to the objective conclusion

22:56.041 --> 22:58.041
that he is not.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.583
Well... somehow I think

22:59.625 --> 23:01.625
we're going to catch the

22:59.625 --> 23:01.625
Romulans with their pants down

23:01.667 --> 23:04.834
on Nelvana III,

23:01.667 --> 23:04.834
just like he says.

23:08.417 --> 23:10.166
"With their pants...?"

23:10.208 --> 23:11.583
A metaphor.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.750
Catching them in the act.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.959
Because your gut

23:13.792 --> 23:15.959
tells you so.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.291
Exactly.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.208
But you can't always

23:17.333 --> 23:20.208
go with your gut, either.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.375
It's...

23:21.417 --> 23:23.875
Well, it's

23:21.417 --> 23:23.875
a combination, Data.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.959
All right, I'll put it to you

23:23.917 --> 23:25.959
this way.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.250
All these feelings that get

23:26.000 --> 23:29.250
in the way of human judgment,

23:29.291 --> 23:31.000
that confuse the hell out of us,

23:31.041 --> 23:33.333
that make us

23:31.041 --> 23:33.333
second-guess ourselves--

23:33.375 --> 23:34.875
well, we need them.

23:34.917 --> 23:36.375
We need them to...

23:36.417 --> 23:37.875
help us fill in

23:36.417 --> 23:37.875
the missing pieces

23:37.917 --> 23:41.250
because we almost never

23:37.917 --> 23:41.250
have all the facts.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.458
So a person fills in

23:43.000 --> 23:47.458
the missing pieces of the puzzle

23:47.500 --> 23:51.792
with his own personality,

23:47.500 --> 23:51.792
resulting in a conclusion

23:51.834 --> 23:55.166
based as much

23:51.834 --> 23:55.166
on instinct

23:51.834 --> 23:55.166
and intuition

23:55.208 --> 23:56.333
as on fact.

23:56.375 --> 23:57.917
Now you're getting it.

23:57.959 --> 23:59.166
Hmm.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.875
But what does one do

24:02.917 --> 24:06.333
if he has no instinct

24:02.917 --> 24:06.333
or intuition?

24:07.750 --> 24:10.417
Data, look at this.

24:10.458 --> 24:13.792
The facts just took

24:10.458 --> 24:13.792
a left turn.

24:13.834 --> 24:16.834
DATA:

24:13.834 --> 24:16.834
As the probe went into

24:13.834 --> 24:16.834
orbit around Nelvana III,

24:16.875 --> 24:19.917
it began picking up

24:16.875 --> 24:19.917
low-level subspace

24:16.875 --> 24:19.917
radio emissions.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.417
Could they be

24:19.959 --> 24:22.417
naturally occurring?

24:22.458 --> 24:24.500
No, sir, the patterns

24:22.458 --> 24:24.500
are clearly artificial.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.166
The signal was so faint,

24:26.208 --> 24:28.291
our ship's sensors

24:26.208 --> 24:28.291
couldn't read it

24:26.208 --> 24:28.291
from this distance.

24:28.333 --> 24:29.834
Can we decode it?

24:29.875 --> 24:31.125
We've tried.

24:31.166 --> 24:33.041
It's probably Romulan,

24:31.166 --> 24:33.041
but we can't be sure.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.458
We've also picked up

24:33.083 --> 24:35.458
ionization disturbances.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.750
Cloaked Romulan ships

24:35.500 --> 24:38.750
could produce that effect.

24:38.792 --> 24:42.000
What about

24:38.792 --> 24:42.000
the planet's surface?

24:42.041 --> 24:44.375
Reading nothing

24:42.041 --> 24:44.375
but barren rock.

24:44.417 --> 24:47.000
I don't know.

24:44.417 --> 24:47.000
They might be able to hide

24:44.417 --> 24:47.000
a base from our probe.

24:47.041 --> 24:48.834
Its capabilities

24:47.041 --> 24:48.834
are limited.

24:48.875 --> 24:51.041
The only way

24:48.875 --> 24:51.041
we'll know for sure

24:51.083 --> 24:54.208
is if we go down

24:51.083 --> 24:54.208
and take a look

24:51.083 --> 24:54.208
for ourselves.

24:54.250 --> 24:57.375
That'll be all, gentlemen.

25:17.083 --> 25:22.709
I take it, you

25:17.083 --> 25:22.709
have never seen

25:17.083 --> 25:22.709
a Romulan before.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.875
That would be

25:22.750 --> 25:25.875
an incorrect assumption.

25:25.917 --> 25:29.291
Then why do you invade

25:25.917 --> 25:29.291
my privacy?

25:29.333 --> 25:33.625
I was attempting to ascertain

25:29.333 --> 25:33.625
what my guts tell me about you.

25:39.917 --> 25:43.083
You're the android.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.625
I know a host

25:43.125 --> 25:46.625
of Romulan cyberneticists

25:46.667 --> 25:48.458
that would love to be

25:48.500 --> 25:50.041
this close to you.

25:50.083 --> 25:54.083
I do not find that concept

25:50.083 --> 25:54.083
particularly appealing.

25:54.125 --> 25:56.959
Nor should you.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.333
I am told

26:01.875 --> 26:04.333
by various crew members

26:04.375 --> 26:07.125
that this viewport is

26:04.375 --> 26:07.125
their favorite on the ship.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.166
Hmm.

26:09.208 --> 26:13.417
I thought it would bring me

26:09.208 --> 26:13.417
some comfort,

26:13.458 --> 26:16.333
but these are not my stars.

26:16.375 --> 26:19.917
Even the heavens

26:16.375 --> 26:19.917
are denied me here.

26:21.917 --> 26:25.458
Oh... synthetic swill.

26:27.458 --> 26:30.041
I don't suppose

26:27.458 --> 26:30.041
your food terminals

26:30.083 --> 26:33.834
would be capable

26:30.083 --> 26:33.834
of producing a Romulan ale?

26:33.875 --> 26:35.375
I am afraid that would require

26:35.417 --> 26:38.000
the molecular structure

26:35.417 --> 26:38.000
of the beverage in question.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.875
And, as you are no doubt aware

26:39.917 --> 26:42.667
our knowledge of your planet

26:39.917 --> 26:42.667
is quite limited.

26:42.709 --> 26:44.750
The loss is yours.

26:44.792 --> 26:50.291
For I have visited

26:44.792 --> 26:50.291
over a hundred different worlds

26:50.333 --> 26:56.041
and none possessed

26:50.333 --> 26:56.041
the awesome beauty of Romulus.

26:56.083 --> 26:57.750
Am I correct in assuming

26:57.792 --> 27:00.166
you regret your decision

26:57.792 --> 27:00.166
to come here?

27:00.208 --> 27:04.750
What I did had to be done,

27:04.792 --> 27:09.250
but... never again

27:09.291 --> 27:14.792
to see the firefalls

27:09.291 --> 27:14.792
at Gal Gath'thong

27:14.834 --> 27:17.750
and the spires of my home

27:17.792 --> 27:22.000
as they rise

27:17.792 --> 27:22.000
above the Apnex Sea at dawn.

27:22.041 --> 27:27.000
It's a bitter thing

27:22.041 --> 27:27.000
to be exiled from your own home.

27:27.041 --> 27:29.959
It does appear

27:27.041 --> 27:29.959
unlikely

27:30.000 --> 27:32.834
you will ever be allowed

27:30.000 --> 27:32.834
to return to your planet.

27:32.875 --> 27:37.959
The cold reaction

27:32.875 --> 27:37.959
of an android.

27:42.166 --> 27:45.834
But perhaps we can bring Romulus

27:42.166 --> 27:45.834
to you.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.917
COMPUTER:

27:49.667 --> 27:51.917
Program complete.

27:51.959 --> 27:53.875
Run program.

27:56.291 --> 27:57.875
After you.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.917
The Valley of Chula.

28:16.959 --> 28:19.417
I know it well.

28:19.458 --> 28:24.083
You are free to stay here

28:19.458 --> 28:24.083
as long as you wish.

28:26.458 --> 28:28.875
I no longer live here.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.917
Turn it off.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.208
Cancel program.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.959
This...

28:40.000 --> 28:44.291
this is my home now,

28:40.000 --> 28:44.291
my future.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.875
I have sacrificed everything.

28:46.917 --> 28:51.875
It must not be in vain.

28:51.917 --> 28:55.250
Arrange a meeting between

28:51.917 --> 28:55.250
myself and Captain Picard.

29:00.041 --> 29:04.709
Tell him Admiral Jarok

29:00.041 --> 29:04.709
wants to see him.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.709
Captain, we have confirmed

29:12.750 --> 29:15.709
that you are holding

29:12.750 --> 29:15.709
Admiral Alidar Jarok.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.834
He has been identified

29:15.750 --> 29:17.834
as the commander

29:17.875 --> 29:19.917
at the massacre

29:17.875 --> 29:19.917
of the Norkan outposts.

29:19.959 --> 29:23.667
The council strongly advises

29:19.959 --> 29:23.667
that you consider Jarok

29:23.709 --> 29:26.208
an unreliable source

29:23.709 --> 29:26.208
of information.

29:33.583 --> 29:35.458
Bring him in.

29:37.875 --> 29:40.583
Ensign, will you

29:37.875 --> 29:40.583
wait outside?

29:43.500 --> 29:46.000
Have a seat,

29:43.500 --> 29:46.000
Admiral Jarok.

29:46.041 --> 29:48.583
Captain, there is

29:46.041 --> 29:48.583
no more time.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.959
Admiral,

29:48.625 --> 29:50.959
have a seat.

29:56.333 --> 30:01.583
You see, I'm just not convinced

29:56.333 --> 30:01.583
that you are telling the truth.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.333
What must I do?

30:04.375 --> 30:07.250
You must convince me.

30:07.291 --> 30:11.709
If I had irrefutable evidence...

30:11.750 --> 30:14.625
but you did not bring

30:11.750 --> 30:14.625
irrefutable evidence.

30:14.667 --> 30:16.583
You brought no evidence at all.

30:16.625 --> 30:19.709
And now I hear you are not

30:16.625 --> 30:19.709
the man you claimed to be.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.041
Admiral...

30:21.083 --> 30:25.834
your credibility

30:21.083 --> 30:25.834
is stretched

30:21.083 --> 30:25.834
beyond belief.

30:25.875 --> 30:31.166
A Romulan defector is almost

30:25.875 --> 30:31.166
a contradiction in terms.

30:31.208 --> 30:34.250
But Admiral Jarok

30:31.208 --> 30:34.250
crossing the lines?

30:34.291 --> 30:38.000
I explained my motivations

30:34.291 --> 30:38.000
to your interrogators.

30:38.041 --> 30:41.834
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes--

30:38.041 --> 30:41.834
peace in our galaxy.

30:41.875 --> 30:44.667
Except, Admiral,

30:41.875 --> 30:44.667
you are not a man of peace.

30:44.709 --> 30:48.125
Your military record,

30:44.709 --> 30:48.125
what we know of it, is clear.

30:48.166 --> 30:52.458
Which is precisely why I chose

30:48.166 --> 30:52.458
an alternate identity here.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.834
The massacres in the Norkan

30:52.500 --> 30:55.834
outposts, for example.

30:55.875 --> 31:00.250
What you call "massacres"

30:55.875 --> 31:00.250
were called

31:00.291 --> 31:05.500
the "Norkan campaigns"

31:00.291 --> 31:05.500
on my world, Captain.

31:05.542 --> 31:10.125
One world's butcher

31:05.542 --> 31:10.125
is another world's hero.

31:10.166 --> 31:12.959
Perhaps I am neither one.

31:16.166 --> 31:20.709
On what basis, Admiral,

31:16.166 --> 31:20.709
am I to decide?

31:20.750 --> 31:22.542
Hmm?

31:24.792 --> 31:26.750
Your good word?

31:26.792 --> 31:29.583
Are you willing

31:26.792 --> 31:29.583
to help us overpower

31:29.625 --> 31:33.125
the Romulan B-Type warbirds

31:29.625 --> 31:33.125
we may encounter?

31:33.166 --> 31:36.417
Are you prepared

31:33.166 --> 31:36.417
to help us detect them

31:36.458 --> 31:38.834
through their

31:36.458 --> 31:38.834
cloaking shields?

31:41.291 --> 31:45.583
Well, you see

31:41.291 --> 31:45.583
my problem, Admiral.

31:45.625 --> 31:48.500
You ask us for faith

31:48.542 --> 31:52.166
in circumstances which are

31:48.542 --> 31:52.166
hardly possible to believe

31:52.208 --> 31:55.291
compounded by lies

31:52.208 --> 31:55.291
and your refusal to tell us

31:55.333 --> 31:56.417
what you know.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.709
I cannot betray my people.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.834
You've already betrayed

31:58.750 --> 32:00.834
your people, Admiral.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.208
You've made your choices, sir.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.125
You're a traitor.

32:04.166 --> 32:06.709
Now, if the bitter taste of that

32:04.166 --> 32:06.709
is unpalatable to you,

32:06.750 --> 32:09.000
I am truly sorry.

32:09.041 --> 32:11.250
But I will not

32:09.041 --> 32:11.250
risk my crew

32:11.291 --> 32:15.583
because you think you can dance

32:11.291 --> 32:15.583
on the edge of the Neutral Zone.

32:15.625 --> 32:19.000
You've crossed

32:15.625 --> 32:19.000
over, Admiral.

32:19.041 --> 32:23.333
You make yourself comfortable

32:19.041 --> 32:23.333
with that.

32:25.417 --> 32:30.291
Do you... have any children,

32:25.417 --> 32:30.291
Captain Picard, a family?

32:30.333 --> 32:33.000
No.

32:33.041 --> 32:39.667
Oh. Then you have sacrificed

32:33.041 --> 32:39.667
too much for your career.

32:39.709 --> 32:42.792
Yes, this is all

32:39.709 --> 32:42.792
very interesting...

32:42.834 --> 32:45.709
There comes a time

32:42.834 --> 32:45.709
in a man's life

32:45.750 --> 32:47.291
that you cannot know

32:47.333 --> 32:51.250
when he looks down at the first

32:47.333 --> 32:51.250
smile of his baby girl

32:51.291 --> 32:56.500
and realizes he must change

32:51.291 --> 32:56.500
the world for her--

32:56.542 --> 32:59.417
for all children.

32:59.458 --> 33:02.625
It is for her that I am here.

33:02.667 --> 33:07.834
Not to destroy the Romulan

33:02.667 --> 33:07.834
Empire, but to save it.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.041
For months

33:10.083 --> 33:14.166
I tried desperately

33:10.083 --> 33:14.166
to persuade the High Command

33:14.208 --> 33:17.709
that another war

33:14.208 --> 33:17.709
would destroy the Empire.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.625
They got tired of my arguments.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.667
Finally, I was censured,

33:21.709 --> 33:23.959
sent off to command

33:21.709 --> 33:23.959
some distant sector.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.208
This was my only recourse.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.125
I...

33:32.166 --> 33:37.750
will never see

33:32.166 --> 33:37.750
my child smile again.

33:37.792 --> 33:40.625
She will grow up

33:37.792 --> 33:40.625
believing

33:40.667 --> 33:45.417
that her father is a traitor.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.625
But she will grow up...

33:48.667 --> 33:49.875
if you act, Picard,

33:49.917 --> 33:54.750
if we stop

33:49.917 --> 33:54.750
this war before it begins.

33:54.792 --> 33:58.917
I can't and I won't...

33:58.959 --> 34:03.750
unless I have

33:58.959 --> 34:03.750
unequivocal cooperation.

34:20.083 --> 34:26.625
Admiral Jarok has provided me

34:20.083 --> 34:26.625
with the locations, strengths

34:26.667 --> 34:30.208
and tactical plans

34:26.667 --> 34:30.208
of the Romulan fleet.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.750
Mr. La Forge, he is prepared

34:32.792 --> 34:36.625
to give you data

34:32.792 --> 34:36.625
regarding engines,

34:36.667 --> 34:38.834
weapons, and the

34:36.667 --> 34:38.834
cloaking systems

34:38.875 --> 34:41.166
of the warbird

34:38.875 --> 34:41.166
class starship.

34:41.208 --> 34:42.792
But I believe

34:42.834 --> 34:46.000
his experience as a field

34:42.834 --> 34:46.000
commander will be more valuable

34:46.041 --> 34:49.000
for its strategic sense

34:46.041 --> 34:49.000
than in the technical areas.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.917
Any edge will help, Captain.

34:50.959 --> 34:52.166
Don't depend on this.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.417
For all we know,

34:52.208 --> 34:53.417
he may be still lying,

34:53.458 --> 34:55.125
but we shall find that out

34:53.458 --> 34:55.125
soon enough.

34:55.166 --> 34:56.083
Number One,

34:56.125 --> 34:58.417
set course for Nelvana III.

35:04.333 --> 35:07.875
DATA:

35:04.333 --> 35:07.875
<i>Second Officer's Log,</i>

35:04.333 --> 35:07.875
<i>Stardate 43465.2.</i>

35:07.917 --> 35:09.750
<i>We have entered</i>

35:07.917 --> 35:09.750
<i>the Neutral Zone</i>

35:09.792 --> 35:12.625
<i>in direct violation</i>

35:09.792 --> 35:12.625
<i>of the Treaty of Algeron.</i>

35:12.667 --> 35:15.917
<i>Presuming Romulan warships</i>

35:12.667 --> 35:15.917
<i>are cloaked and monitoring us,</i>

35:15.959 --> 35:17.625
<i>we expect heavy resistance</i>

35:17.667 --> 35:19.583
<i>as we approach Nelvana III.</i>

35:19.625 --> 35:20.542
Tactical?

35:20.583 --> 35:21.792
Nothing on sensors.

35:21.834 --> 35:23.959
I don't like it.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.667
I would have expected

35:24.000 --> 35:26.667
a greeting party.

35:26.709 --> 35:29.333
You echo

35:26.709 --> 35:29.333
another noteworthy commander

35:29.375 --> 35:31.125
in similar circumstances,

35:29.375 --> 35:31.125
Number One.

35:31.166 --> 35:33.333
A countryman

35:31.166 --> 35:33.333
of yours--

35:33.375 --> 35:34.875
George Armstrong Custer

35:34.917 --> 35:38.625
when his Seventh Cavalry

35:34.917 --> 35:38.625
arrived at The Little Bighorn.

35:38.667 --> 35:40.291
May we have better luck.

35:40.333 --> 35:42.333
Approaching Nelvana system.

35:42.375 --> 35:44.542
Engage impulse engines.

35:49.458 --> 35:51.458
Nelvana III on screen.

35:57.834 --> 36:00.542
Still no signs of them

35:57.834 --> 36:00.542
on sensors.

36:00.583 --> 36:04.125
In a way, I'd rather be fighting

36:00.583 --> 36:04.125
my way through this.

36:04.166 --> 36:05.709
It's just too damned easy.

36:05.750 --> 36:08.166
Prepare to enter

36:05.750 --> 36:08.166
standard orbit.

36:14.375 --> 36:15.333
Data?

36:15.375 --> 36:17.500
Scanning

36:15.375 --> 36:17.500
the planet, sir.

36:17.542 --> 36:21.041
No life forms, no power sources,

36:17.542 --> 36:21.041
no weapons systems.

36:21.083 --> 36:23.041
No indication

36:21.083 --> 36:23.041
of a base at all?

36:23.083 --> 36:24.417
DATA:

36:23.083 --> 36:24.417
No, sir.

36:24.458 --> 36:27.125
The subspace signal

36:24.458 --> 36:27.125
the probe detected?

36:27.166 --> 36:28.291
The ionization

36:27.166 --> 36:28.291
disturbances?

36:28.333 --> 36:30.709
DATA:

36:28.333 --> 36:30.709
I am picking them up, sir

36:30.750 --> 36:32.834
but I cannot identify

36:30.750 --> 36:32.834
the source.

36:32.875 --> 36:36.291
They seem to be moving

36:32.875 --> 36:36.291
in an orbital path

36:36.333 --> 36:39.208
with an 800-kilometer apogee.

36:42.458 --> 36:45.041
Lieutenant Worf,

36:42.458 --> 36:45.041
bring the Admiral up here.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.375
Aye, sir.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.333
Maybe they abandoned the planet

36:50.000 --> 36:53.333
after he defected.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.375
There is no scarring

36:53.375 --> 36:55.375
on the planet surface

36:55.417 --> 36:58.291
that would denote heavy

36:55.417 --> 36:58.291
construction of any kind.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.166
A cloaking device of some sort

36:58.333 --> 37:01.166
to hide the entire base?

37:01.208 --> 37:03.667
A cloaking device

37:01.208 --> 37:03.667
operating on the surface

37:03.709 --> 37:06.375
would be given away

37:03.709 --> 37:06.375
by visible distortion effects.

37:12.375 --> 37:14.542
Perhaps you would care

37:12.375 --> 37:14.542
to explain

37:14.583 --> 37:16.333
why we are here, Admiral.

37:16.375 --> 37:19.875
There doesn't appear

37:16.375 --> 37:19.875
to be a base.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.041
I don't understand.

37:25.083 --> 37:27.709
PICARD:

37:25.083 --> 37:27.709
Nelvana III, Admiral!

37:25.083 --> 37:27.709
No base!

37:27.750 --> 37:28.875
No weapons!

37:28.917 --> 37:31.291
No sign of any life at all!

37:36.417 --> 37:41.125
I-I saw

37:36.417 --> 37:41.125
the tactical communiqués--

37:41.166 --> 37:45.375
the records,

37:41.166 --> 37:45.375
timetables for completion.

37:45.417 --> 37:49.333
An entire legion

37:45.417 --> 37:49.333
was assigned to this section.

37:49.375 --> 37:53.667
Is it possible they could have

37:49.375 --> 37:53.667
been feeding you disinformation?

37:57.291 --> 37:59.500
You said

37:57.291 --> 37:59.500
that you had been censured--

37:59.542 --> 38:01.333
reassigned four months ago.

38:01.375 --> 38:03.917
They knew

38:01.375 --> 38:03.917
of your dissatisfaction.

38:03.959 --> 38:08.041
Could all this have been

38:03.959 --> 38:08.041
to test your loyalty?

38:08.083 --> 38:11.333
No.

38:11.375 --> 38:13.750
No!

38:13.792 --> 38:15.750
It's impossible.

38:26.208 --> 38:28.750
They let you escape

38:28.792 --> 38:31.750
with an arsenal

38:28.792 --> 38:31.750
of worthless secrets.

38:31.792 --> 38:34.834
What other explanation

38:31.792 --> 38:34.834
is there?

38:34.875 --> 38:36.834
Permission to withdraw

38:34.875 --> 38:36.834
from the Neutral Zone.

38:36.875 --> 38:38.500
At your earliest convenience,

38:36.875 --> 38:38.500
Number One.

38:38.542 --> 38:40.834
Helm, bring her around

38:38.542 --> 38:40.834
180 degrees!

38:40.875 --> 38:43.417
Geordi,

38:40.875 --> 38:43.417
get us out of here!

38:43.458 --> 38:45.667
GEORDI:

38:43.458 --> 38:45.667
I hear you, Commander.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.083
Two Romulan warships

38:53.500 --> 38:55.083
uncloaking.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.291
Coordinates...

39:04.959 --> 39:06.208
Shields holding.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.667
Damage?

39:07.709 --> 39:09.208
La FORGE:

39:07.709 --> 39:09.208
Minor damage

39:07.709 --> 39:09.208
to the secondary hull.

39:09.250 --> 39:11.291
Power transfer fields

39:09.250 --> 39:11.291
may be pinched off.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.667
I'm working on it.

39:13.709 --> 39:15.000
Captain?

39:15.041 --> 39:17.083
Not yet, Mr. Worf.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.625
This is just a tap

39:17.125 --> 39:19.625
on the shoulder

39:19.667 --> 39:22.250
or we wouldn't be here

39:19.667 --> 39:22.250
talking about it.

39:22.291 --> 39:24.500
The Romulans

39:22.291 --> 39:24.500
are hailing us.

39:24.542 --> 39:25.959
On screen.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.792
TOMALAK:

39:26.000 --> 39:27.792
Captain Picard,

39:27.834 --> 39:31.250
I hardly expected

39:27.834 --> 39:31.250
to see you again so soon.

39:31.291 --> 39:33.834
It seems this time

39:31.291 --> 39:33.834
<i>you</i> are the one

39:33.875 --> 39:37.166
who has made an aggressive move

39:33.875 --> 39:37.166
across the Neutral Zone.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.291
Commander Tomalak,

39:37.208 --> 39:40.291
as I am sure you already know,

39:40.333 --> 39:42.333
we were responding

39:40.333 --> 39:42.333
to warnings

39:42.375 --> 39:45.041
of Romulan incursions

39:42.375 --> 39:45.041
at Nelvana III.

39:45.083 --> 39:50.250
But, Captain, as you can see,

39:45.083 --> 39:50.250
there is no incursion.

39:50.291 --> 39:52.542
And the matter

39:50.291 --> 39:52.542
of the unidentified

39:52.583 --> 39:56.333
subspace radio emissions

39:52.583 --> 39:56.333
and the ionization disturbances?

39:56.375 --> 40:00.417
Oh, you must mean

39:56.375 --> 40:00.417
our orbiting probe.

40:00.458 --> 40:06.458
We are studying Nelvana III

40:00.458 --> 40:06.458
for... archaeological research.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.291
With a cloaked satellite?

40:09.333 --> 40:12.667
Oh, really, Captain,

40:09.333 --> 40:12.667
would you have us believe

40:12.709 --> 40:14.583
this satellite is an excuse

40:14.625 --> 40:17.166
for your aggressive charge

40:14.625 --> 40:17.166
across the Neutral Zone?

40:17.208 --> 40:19.500
You can believe

40:17.208 --> 40:19.500
what you wish,

40:19.542 --> 40:21.417
and we will be on our way.

40:21.458 --> 40:24.291
Without even an apology,

40:21.458 --> 40:24.291
Captain?

40:24.333 --> 40:28.041
If an apology will do,

40:24.333 --> 40:28.041
then I offer it.

40:28.083 --> 40:29.208
I'm afraid it won't,

40:29.250 --> 40:31.875
so I will save you

40:29.250 --> 40:31.875
the humiliation.

40:31.917 --> 40:33.792
Get to it, Tomalak!

40:33.834 --> 40:37.417
You see, Picard,

40:33.834 --> 40:37.417
after we dissect your<i> Enterprise</i>

40:37.458 --> 40:40.417
for every precious bit

40:37.458 --> 40:40.417
of information,

40:40.458 --> 40:43.125
I intend to display

40:40.458 --> 40:43.125
its broken hull

40:43.166 --> 40:44.959
in the center

40:43.166 --> 40:44.959
of the Romulan capitol

40:45.000 --> 40:46.709
as a symbol of our victory.

40:46.750 --> 40:50.291
It will inspire our armies

40:46.750 --> 40:50.291
for generations to come

40:50.333 --> 40:52.834
and serve as a warning

40:50.333 --> 40:52.834
to any other traitor

40:52.875 --> 40:55.333
who would create ripples

40:52.875 --> 40:55.333
of disloyalty.

41:00.709 --> 41:05.583
All the communiqués,

41:00.709 --> 41:05.583
all the timetables,

41:05.625 --> 41:08.959
all the records--

41:05.625 --> 41:08.959
they were all fiction

41:09.000 --> 41:10.917
written

41:09.000 --> 41:10.917
for my benefit.

41:10.959 --> 41:12.500
A test...

41:12.542 --> 41:15.834
a test of my loyalty.

41:15.875 --> 41:19.917
And you used me

41:15.875 --> 41:19.917
to lure the<i> Enterprise</i>

41:19.959 --> 41:22.333
into the

41:19.959 --> 41:22.333
Neutral Zone.

41:22.375 --> 41:28.291
First, Captain, you will

41:22.375 --> 41:28.291
return the traitor, Jarok.

41:28.333 --> 41:32.041
Then you will surrender

41:28.333 --> 41:32.041
as prisoners of war.

41:32.083 --> 41:34.917
Do you seriously expect me

41:32.083 --> 41:34.917
to accept those terms?

41:34.959 --> 41:41.625
No, Captain Picard,

41:34.959 --> 41:41.625
I expect you won't.

41:41.667 --> 41:45.333
You have 30 seconds to decide.

41:45.375 --> 41:47.667
I do not require

41:45.375 --> 41:47.667
one, Tomalak.

41:47.709 --> 41:52.500
I urge you, Captain Picard--

41:47.709 --> 41:52.500
surrender.

41:52.542 --> 41:55.542
Consider the men and women

41:52.542 --> 41:55.542
you would lead

41:55.583 --> 41:57.959
into a lost cause.

42:01.375 --> 42:05.333
If the cause is just

42:01.375 --> 42:05.333
and honorable,

42:05.375 --> 42:07.917
they are prepared

42:05.375 --> 42:07.917
to give their lives.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.625
Are you prepared

42:07.959 --> 42:10.625
to die today, Tomalak?

42:10.667 --> 42:16.000
I expected more from you

42:10.667 --> 42:16.000
than an idle threat, Picard.

42:16.041 --> 42:19.083
Then you shall have it.

42:19.125 --> 42:20.625
Mr. Worf.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.583
Aye, sir.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.667
Klingon warships--

42:31.458 --> 42:34.667
armed and ready, sir.

42:37.166 --> 42:39.875
What shall it

42:37.166 --> 42:39.875
be, Tomalak?

42:39.917 --> 42:44.083
You will still not survive

42:39.917 --> 42:44.083
our assault.

42:44.125 --> 42:47.208
And you will not survive ours.

42:47.250 --> 42:49.291
Shall we die together?

42:52.250 --> 42:56.667
I look forward to our

42:52.250 --> 42:56.667
next meeting, Captain.

42:59.667 --> 43:03.125
Romulan disrupters

42:59.667 --> 43:03.125
are powering down, sir.

43:08.041 --> 43:11.709
Cancel Red Alert.

43:13.750 --> 43:15.417
Mr. Worf, will

43:13.750 --> 43:15.417
you extend

43:15.458 --> 43:17.667
the appreciation

43:15.458 --> 43:17.667
of the Federation

43:17.709 --> 43:20.583
and my personal gratitude

43:17.709 --> 43:20.583
to the Klingons.

43:20.625 --> 43:22.667
Aye, sir.

43:22.709 --> 43:28.000
Take us back,

43:22.709 --> 43:28.000
Number One.

43:28.041 --> 43:32.583
I did it for nothing.

43:32.625 --> 43:37.125
My home, my family...

43:37.166 --> 43:39.500
for nothing.

43:50.625 --> 43:52.625
He ingested

43:50.625 --> 43:52.625
a Felodesine chip.

43:52.667 --> 43:54.709
He must have

43:52.667 --> 43:54.709
brought it with him.

43:54.750 --> 43:58.709
I'm sorry, Captain,

43:54.750 --> 43:58.709
there was no antidote.

43:58.750 --> 44:03.542
A letter to his wife

43:58.750 --> 44:03.542
and daughter.

44:03.583 --> 44:07.250
Sir, he must have known

44:03.583 --> 44:07.250
it would be impossible

44:07.291 --> 44:10.959
for us to deliver it.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.041
Today, perhaps,

44:13.083 --> 44:14.959
but if there are others

44:15.000 --> 44:17.166
with the courage

44:15.000 --> 44:17.166
of Admiral Jarok,

44:17.208 --> 44:19.834
we may hope to see

44:17.208 --> 44:19.834
a day of peace

44:19.875 --> 44:25.166
when we<i> can</i>

44:19.875 --> 44:25.166
take his letter home.
