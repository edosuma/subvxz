WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:04.640
We are interested in a book in
the possession of Edward Kelley.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.600
I've sent the ambassadors to
Bohemia to retrieve Kelley.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.160
The emperor rebuffed them.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.920
Perhaps he will be more receptive to me.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.680
You can be very persuasive.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.320
My father has commanded me
to return to Sept-Tours.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.320
-Matthew!
-Stay back!

00:20.480 --> 00:22.520
This is what we call blood rage.

00:22.680 --> 00:26.720
It is an affliction,
sickness of the vampire blood.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.240
<i>The body was... torn apart.</i>

00:29.400 --> 00:31.400
<i>I haven't seen anything</i>
<i>like that in centuries</i>

00:31.560 --> 00:33.160
<i>and we do all</i>
<i>know the rumors</i>

00:33.320 --> 00:36.280
<i>about the De Clermonts'</i>
<i>infected bloodline.</i>

00:36.440 --> 00:39.160
You're reborn and forever
a member of our family.

00:39.320 --> 00:43.480
I'm Matthew, give my body to you,
Diana, in faithful matrimony.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.400
And I receive it.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.880
<i>My dearest Isabeau,</i>

00:47.040 --> 00:50.760
<i>I am able to find words to straddle</i>
<i>the centuries that separated.</i>

00:50.920 --> 00:55.840
<i>Our son mated to a woman who</i>
<i>walks in the footsteps of the goddess.</i>

00:56.000 --> 01:00.440
<i>They journey now to Bohemia</i>
<i>in search of the </i>Book of Life.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.560
Halt.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.920
<i>Wie geht dahin?</i>

01:58.480 --> 02:00.160
I'm Matthew Roydon,

02:00.320 --> 02:02.720
I'm here on business for
Queen Elizabeth of England.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.320
His Imperial Majesty Rudolf II
tires of Elizabeth's ambassadors...

02:07.480 --> 02:10.120
I am no mere ambassador,

02:10.280 --> 02:14.920
and I will have the Emperor's
answer from his own lips. Not yours.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.040
Find Gallowglass and my man
Pierre, would you?

03:03.720 --> 03:05.640
Wait here.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.280
This is just the Emperor's
hunting lodge?

03:13.440 --> 03:17.520
Yes. Kelley chose
his benefactor very well.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.040
The might
of the Holy Roman Empire

03:19.200 --> 03:21.840
dwarves that of England
in every respect.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.640
He certainly
has an eye for beauty.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.640
Hmm.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.240
His Imperial Majesty
grants you a brief audience.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.440
Even when I retreat
into the mountains,

03:54.600 --> 03:58.320
I cannot escape a pestering
by England's diplomatic hordes.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.040
Matthew Roydon,
Your Majesty.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.440
I know exactly who you are,
Matthaus de Clermont.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.520
Since you introduce yourself
as Roydon,

04:04.680 --> 04:08.160
I then assume you are here in
your capacity as Elizabeth's spy?

04:08.320 --> 04:11.480
I come representing my Queen,
but not as a spy.

04:11.640 --> 04:15.040
I would speak with her
subject, Edward Kelley.

04:15.200 --> 04:19.400
Then you are in the wrong place.
<i>Herr </i>Kelley resides in Prague.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.040
I have heard that
he travels with your court.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.440
Do you question me?

04:27.600 --> 04:31.760
I know what you are, vampire.

04:31.920 --> 04:36.360
Remember, you are only permitted
on Bohemian soil by my grace.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.800
I apologize, Your Majesty...
Matthew is only pressing my case.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.760
I had hoped I would be given
an opportunity for discourse

04:44.920 --> 04:48.480
with one of England's
most esteemed alchemists.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.840
You have an interest in alchemy?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.840
It has been my life's work.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.400
Might an Emperor ask your name?

04:57.560 --> 05:00.760
Diana, Your Majesty.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.360
<i>La diosa del casa!</i>

05:04.520 --> 05:07.600
The goddess... of the hunt.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.840
May I introduce my wife,
Your Majesty?

05:11.000 --> 05:15.320
My spies would have informed me had
Elizabeth's Shadow taken a wife...

05:15.480 --> 05:19.640
particularly one so intriguing.

05:19.800 --> 05:24.080
Perhaps you should consider
hiring more thorough spies,

05:24.240 --> 05:25.600
Your Majesty.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.800
Enjoy your time in Bohemia,
Mistress Roydon.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.560
Use it to teach your husband
manners befitting my court.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.360
I don't like the way
he looks at you.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.480
Like a jewel he wanted to add
to his collection.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.560
Oh, I can handle
a little clumsy flirting

06:51.720 --> 06:54.240
if it gets us closer to the Book.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.840
Gallowglass!

07:00.520 --> 07:02.400
Oh!

07:09.280 --> 07:11.760
You've mated?

07:11.920 --> 07:15.480
Well... I should
call you Auntie now?

07:15.640 --> 07:18.160
-Where is Pierre?
-At the lodgings.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.680
We have an unexpected guest.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.880
This way.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.720
-Mistress Roydon!
-Jack!

07:32.880 --> 07:34.680
We was on an enormous ship
and there was a storm

07:34.840 --> 07:37.880
and lots of people were sick,
but I wasn't.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.920
Come now, Jack,

07:40.080 --> 07:41.680
bedtime.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.400
I know.
But once you left...

07:49.560 --> 07:53.240
nightmares every time he slept,
weeping through the day.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.120
And you brought him
to Bohemia?

07:55.280 --> 07:57.000
He tried to come on his own.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.920
I couldn't take my eye off him.
It wasn't safe.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.880
It's not safe here!

08:03.360 --> 08:04.880
I'm sorry.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.280
But what would you have me do?
Keep him prisoner?

08:15.360 --> 08:17.040
Rudolf might be
telling the truth.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.600
No one I have spoken to
has seen Kelley.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
I doubt that the Emperor
would leave behind

08:21.920 --> 08:24.560
the man who's offered him
eternal life.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.000
-He'll be here somewhere.
-What about the Book?

08:27.160 --> 08:31.280
As long as we reach Kelley...
he'll lead us to it.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.880
Or he'll bring it to us.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.560
Rudolf thinks the Book is key to
creating the Philosopher's Stone,

08:35.720 --> 08:37.360
he's won't let Kelley take it.

08:37.520 --> 08:38.840
Ah, you're right there.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.640
You see, once the Emperor
sets his heart on something,

08:41.800 --> 08:45.600
he'll stop at nothing to get it.
And once he has it...

08:56.440 --> 08:58.320
For the goddess.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.240
A goddess...

09:05.400 --> 09:07.920
I assume
that's not you, Matthew.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.400
It's an automaton.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.840
The goddess of the hunt.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.520
<i>What is the matter?</i>

09:33.680 --> 09:36.680
What's the matter? I take it you
saw how hostile the Emperor was.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.160
I saw how hostile
he was towards you.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.000
He lit up
when I mentioned alchemy.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.160
You saw the gift he sent me.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.640
He's practically inviting me
back to the castle.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.120
I can bring him Dee's book,

09:51.280 --> 09:54.560
convince him it's something
that he wants...

09:54.720 --> 09:58.400
No.
Kelley is the key.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.040
And the less we arouse
the attention of the Emperor,

10:01.200 --> 10:03.280
the more likely we'll be able to
get Kelley back to England safely.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.000
We don't even know
if he's here.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.840
At least, let me try
while you look for him.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.720
I'll take Gallowglass with me.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.960
Diana Roydon. I have a gift
for His Imperial Majesty.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.400
So does everyone,
<i>Frau </i>Roydon.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.400
So does everyone.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.520
Madame will be all right.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.720
Mm.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.520
Kelley must have
a laboratory here,

11:08.680 --> 11:11.960
somewhere he can continue
his work undisturbed.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.200
Let's take a look
at the apothecary, Pierre.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.240
I'm surprised Matthew let you
approach the Emperor alone.

11:24.400 --> 11:29.040
Well, my husband's changed a lot in
the 400 years since you knew him.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.040
But now you're mated.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.880
And it's different.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.600
Blood rage is harder to control,
it's primal.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.520
Physical.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.880
If provoked...

11:42.040 --> 11:44.720
he will struggle
to contain himself.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.320
Oh... we're gonna be here
till midnight at this rate.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.160
-Wait here.
-What are you doing?

11:59.320 --> 12:02.000
Accelerating proceedings.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.720
Madame De Clermont?

12:14.880 --> 12:16.840
Apologies.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.040
Such a recent blood vow
is positively deafening.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.680
I am Benjamin Fuchs.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.440
I work as a collector
for the Emperor.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.200
Are you a friend
of the de Clermonts?

12:29.360 --> 12:32.440
I fear I am
beneath their interest.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.480
I was cast out of my own clan.

12:35.640 --> 12:39.400
I have always found myself
more comfortable around

12:39.560 --> 12:41.560
other kinds of creature.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.440
Even for
the Emperor's alchemist?

12:57.560 --> 13:00.160
You are not
the Imperial alchemist.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.200
Ah, so,
you have met him?

13:02.360 --> 13:06.400
It seems strange to be closed during
the middle of the day, <i>Herr </i>Steiner.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.720
But then, perhaps,
you're expecting more customers

13:08.880 --> 13:10.240
after the sun has fallen?

13:10.400 --> 13:12.440
I open only by appointment, sir.

13:12.600 --> 13:17.200
My exclusive list of clients
command the utmost discretion.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.920
If you wish to browse, might I
suggest you visit the market?

13:44.040 --> 13:48.320
The audience with His Imperial
Majesty is over for today.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.200
Come out.
Keep moving.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.080
Keep moving.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.200
Auntie.
Auntie?

14:01.880 --> 14:03.360
What did you do?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.720
I may have intimated
to the Chamberlain

14:05.880 --> 14:09.560
that we have a very
desirable painting for sale.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.080
La Diosa!

14:20.240 --> 14:23.040
You are a woman
of many surprises.

14:23.200 --> 14:27.560
I hear that you are the owner of a
curious work by Hieronymous Bosch?

14:29.640 --> 14:31.720
You did?

14:32.640 --> 14:37.480
Your Majesty, I... In my haste to
be admitted to your presence, I...

14:37.640 --> 14:42.160
I fear there has been
some miscommunication.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.280
-A miscommunication?
-Yes.

14:45.440 --> 14:50.280
I so desperately wanted to thank you
for the wonderful gift you sent me.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.000
The work of Joachim Fries,
if I'm not mistaken.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.320
It is indeed!
You have quite an eye, mistress.

14:55.480 --> 15:00.160
I do not have the painting
that you wanted.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.280
However,
I do have another gift.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.520
I've seen this before.
It offers no answers, no meaning.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.440
So...

15:23.600 --> 15:26.600
You lie about something I want, in order
to present me with something I do not.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.200
Even books that do not provide
the answers we seek

15:29.360 --> 15:32.520
can still help us
to ask better questions.

15:32.680 --> 15:36.360
Nothing is worthless
to an enquiring mind.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.760
The deepest truths
always come

15:41.920 --> 15:45.320
from the most
unexpected sources.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.040
Send for the rabbi.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.840
Tell me, La Diosa...

15:53.000 --> 15:58.200
are you interested
in the rare and uncanny arts?

16:00.360 --> 16:03.840
Steiner was rattled.
He's hiding something.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.520
He clearly had met Kelley.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.400
He recognized
that I wasn't him.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.520
There's no appointments
for Kelley in his ledger.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.000
But there is a Talbot.
That's an English name.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.560
It's tenuous, I know,

16:13.720 --> 16:16.080
but there are no appointments
listed with him until a week ago.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.600
Shortly after
Rudolf arrived here.

16:18.760 --> 16:23.200
And every appointment with Talbot
is at an odd hour.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.920
-It's always after dark.
-Someone keen to avoid being seen.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.520
But how can we be sure
Talbot is Kelley?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.680
I suppose
we see for ourselves.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.480
Talbot has an appointment
booked for tonight.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.800
Thank you, Pierre.

16:45.480 --> 16:48.760
Allow me to introduce the Rabbi Loew,
known as The Maharal.

16:48.920 --> 16:52.280
A learned scholar
and my honored guest.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.880
The honor is mine,
Your Majesty.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.360
Another tome
for you to decipher.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.320
Come!

17:03.520 --> 17:05.920
The Rabbi has a gift
for ancient languages.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.600
The Hebrew
of his people's book

17:07.760 --> 17:12.000
is perhaps closer to the primitive
tongues long lost to Christian ears.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.120
I have no knowledge
that cannot be learned

17:15.280 --> 17:19.400
by anyone with sufficient
reading, Jew or Gentile.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.560
I cannot believe that!

17:25.360 --> 17:27.040
Please.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.960
Of course the bulk of my Kunstkammer,
I had to leave behind, in Prague.

17:32.120 --> 17:36.240
But the quest for knowledge
must not be abandoned.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.800
I hope the goddess of the hunt

17:40.960 --> 17:45.960
is not disappointed
with my traveling collection.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.840
This drinking vessel...

17:49.000 --> 17:52.440
...is fashioned
from the horn of a unicorn.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.640
Incredible.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.840
Entirely incredible.

18:02.200 --> 18:08.480
In Prague, men speak of a man of
clay, animated by Jewish magics...

18:08.640 --> 18:11.120
the name of God
written inside its skull.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.160
Rumors, Your Highness.
Designed to inspire fear of our people,

18:15.320 --> 18:17.640
who are nothing
but loyal subjects.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.160
But words have power,
do they not?

18:20.320 --> 18:22.440
I have heard that Jews
know the secret names of angels.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.600
Is that so, Your Highness?

18:25.760 --> 18:31.520
As the true meaning of an artwork...
is disguised by symbols...

18:31.680 --> 18:34.840
so might the hidden meaning
of words be revealed

18:35.000 --> 18:37.560
through the mathematics
of their letters.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.960
You have so many
miraculous items,

18:40.120 --> 18:43.520
things I would hardly
have believed existed.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.480
I half expect to find that you've
acquired the Philosopher's Stone.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.840
Alas. The means to create
the Philosopher's Stone

18:52.000 --> 18:54.080
is yet to be discovered,
La Diosa.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.360
Ah, the Root of Eppendorf?

18:56.520 --> 19:01.400
It has the miraculous form
of Jesus Christ.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.040
Trifle late to be shopping,
isn't it, Edward?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.320
Oh, and Queen Elizabeth
sends her regards.

19:18.480 --> 19:24.640
-What do you want from me?
-To talk. Just to talk.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.520
-You can stand your men down.
-They don't answer to me.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.800
So, you are a prisoner?

19:31.960 --> 19:35.800
Has the Emperor has lost patience
with your empty promises?

19:37.560 --> 19:41.240
You know nothing
of my work!

19:41.400 --> 19:44.440
I know you stole
the Book from Dee.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.480
No! The Book is mine.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.840
It speaks to me.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.080
It screams!

19:52.240 --> 19:55.240
You... You have no claim!

19:57.240 --> 20:01.720
It begins with absence
and desire.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.120
Blood and fear.

20:04.280 --> 20:09.080
It begins
with a discovery of witches.

20:09.240 --> 20:13.320
I must work.
My work!

20:25.840 --> 20:29.600
It's very gallant of you to escort
me all the way from our lodgings.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.920
I wanted to speak
to the Maharal myself.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.000
Rabbi Loew is one of history's
most esteemed scholars.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.880
Rudolf brought him here
specifically to decipher books.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.160
Diana...
Kelly was raving.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.720
Rudolf has him as his prisoner. Just...

20:43.880 --> 20:45.600
Be careful what you say.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.400
Whatever rumors
Gallowglass has heard,

20:47.560 --> 20:51.080
Rudolf has been nothing
but kind to me.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.040
We can trust Loew.
I'm sure of it.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.560
Matthew, son of Philippe.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.040
Please.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.600
Thank you.

21:15.760 --> 21:22.360
A witch, a vampire and a Jew,
meeting in secret.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.960
It would set Christian tongues
wagging for miles around.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.200
Oh...

21:36.480 --> 21:38.720
I noticed a yellow circle.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.840
Men fear what they do not
see more than what they do.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.640
The Emperor is convinced
my people hoard secret magics.

21:47.800 --> 21:52.600
Rudolf brought you here
to study a book, didn't he?

21:52.760 --> 21:56.040
Your husband believes that is
a dangerous question to ask.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.960
One should find wholeness
in a marriage, Matthew.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.000
But it should
never become a prison.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.840
Let us be honest
with each other, Maharal.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.960
We are looking for a very
particular alchemical book.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.440
I knew as soon as I saw it,

22:11.600 --> 22:15.320
I was not the one
God has chosen to read it.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.880
Perhaps you are, <i>Frau </i>Roydon?

22:19.040 --> 22:23.640
Rabbi, how did you convince
Rudolf to let you see it?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.360
He convinced himself,

22:25.520 --> 22:28.400
imagining I would succeed
where others had failed.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.320
He will be furious
when I cannot.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.480
Why not just tell him?

22:32.640 --> 22:37.880
<i>Frau </i>Roydon, to disappoint
the Emperor is dangerous.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.880
But to refuse him
could be deadly.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.360
No, I'm done.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.840
Jack, you cheaters won again.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.600
A letter came.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.960
-Oh, yes.
-For Mistress Roydon.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.440
Oh...

23:02.640 --> 23:05.640
It's a summons
to a pheasant hunt.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.840
-With the Emperor.
-Can I come?

23:08.000 --> 23:12.320
Give them a moment to talk, Jack.
Come on.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.640
This has gone too far.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.880
Kelley won't bring us the Book.
We need to go through Rudolf.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.680
-He let Rabbi Loew read it.
-And when the Rabbi fails...

23:23.840 --> 23:26.320
Rudolf will imprison you
like Kelley, or worse.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.880
But I can read it.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.320
All I have to do is
convince Rudolf to let me try.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.000
And what then?
He won't give up the Book.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.800
He will lock you away with it.
His new curiosity.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.560
You just don't like
the way he's around me.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.560
-You have to trust me.
-This is not a matter of trust.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.720
Then let me try!
What other plan do you have?

23:44.880 --> 23:46.960
I've got one.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.160
Both of you join
the Emperor's hunt.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.160
I think I can get into
the kunstkammer annex.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.680
The Book must be
in there somewhere.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.600
If I can steal it,
we can all get out of here

23:59.760 --> 24:01.320
before Rudolf
even knows it's gone.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.840
And what are the Queen's
interests? We need Kelley.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.920
Without the Book,

24:08.080 --> 24:11.640
Rudolf won't have
any use for poor Edward.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.000
Strange.

24:23.160 --> 24:28.240
I only required <i>Frau </i>Roydon's
presence. Not yours.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.480
My apologies.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.840
I simply cannot resist falconry.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.320
Then I suppose we must
find you an appropriate bird.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.640
Artemis, as the Greeks
called Diana.

24:52.680 --> 24:56.640
I cannot say which of you I
should rather hunt with.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.920
Artemis will be mine, Matthaus.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.720
Sarka will be your bird.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.680
-So, she's a warrior then.
-Yes.

25:14.840 --> 25:19.200
During the Maiden's War,
Sarka destroyed an entire battalion

25:19.360 --> 25:21.800
by herself.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.600
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.480
Success in the hunt relies
on the skill of the falconer,

25:26.640 --> 25:30.040
not the wiles
of his bird, Matthaus.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.840
Play nice.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.040
Well done, Your Majesty.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.520
Has Rabbi Loew looked
at the book I gave you yet?

27:47.680 --> 27:50.160
The rabbi has been busy.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.640
With other books?

27:51.800 --> 27:54.960
I fear the Rabbi's learning has
been somewhat exaggerated.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.400
Ask no more
about him or his books.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.880
You have been slow
to loose Sarka, Matthaus.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.920
Afraid to let your bird fly free,

28:05.080 --> 28:08.120
lest she find a more
comfortable place to roost?

28:10.040 --> 28:13.640
I have some experience with
alchemical texts myself.

28:13.800 --> 28:18.360
Yes, you are
an intriguing case, <i>Frau </i>Roydon.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.880
An alchemist and a witch,
and supposedly married to a vampire.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.240
Don't you find his touch
a little cold?

28:27.320 --> 28:28.720
You jest, Your Majesty.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.560
Do you not sometimes wish for
something warmer in your bed?

28:38.480 --> 28:40.760
Release!

29:27.160 --> 29:29.480
You broke my bird!

29:30.600 --> 29:32.720
-Your Majesty, my husband...
-Begone!

29:32.880 --> 29:35.560
You have abused
my kindness monstrously.

29:35.720 --> 29:40.600
Agents! Spies!
I want you gone from my lands!

29:53.400 --> 29:57.920
The Book wasn't there,
but I found something else.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.920
Rudolf's secret collection.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.400
That hand belonged to a witch.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.960
It was in a box with
a necklace of wearh teeth.

30:13.120 --> 30:18.440
The preserved brain of some poor
demon... Bits of creatures.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.520
That's it.
We leave tonight.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.920
-What about the Book?
-Enough of the Book!

30:31.840 --> 30:33.560
I'll...

30:41.920 --> 30:44.560
If you're angry at me,
just say it.

30:44.720 --> 30:48.080
-You are never to see him again.
-Don't fake, Matthew!

30:48.240 --> 30:49.680
Why don't you trust me?

30:49.840 --> 30:51.360
You don't understand.
I don't trust myself.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.440
Then let me speak
to Rudolf alone.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.480
I cannot!

30:55.640 --> 30:57.120
I cannot...

30:58.400 --> 31:00.520
I can smell him on you.

31:04.400 --> 31:08.480
This is why I lied to you.
This is what mating is.

31:08.640 --> 31:12.400
An unspeakable urge
to possess you, body and soul.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.520
The rage that feeds on it.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.480
It's all right, Matthew.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.320
You have never seen
what it makes me do.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.400
You won't hurt me.

31:39.120 --> 31:42.360
No! Not you.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.880
For you.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.120
I would wade through
the blood of kings,

31:47.280 --> 31:50.400
queens and emperors.
I would stop at nothing

31:50.560 --> 31:53.960
to prevent that
from happening to you.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.720
Matthew...

32:03.240 --> 32:05.000
We're still talking.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.040
Let me go...

32:11.000 --> 32:14.960
You are not defined by
the worst things you have done.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.400
You are my husband.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.000
And the most
brilliant man I know.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.320
You are kind.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.520
And gentle.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.800
Come back to me.

32:47.640 --> 32:51.000
You are Matthew de Clermont.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.920
And stronger than this.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.760
The Emperor sends his apologies

33:45.920 --> 33:49.760
and summons you both
to view the kunstkammer.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.880
We have to go.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.320
Tell Pierre to bring
Francoise and Jack,

34:00.480 --> 34:04.440
and enough horses for all of us
to the main gates by nightfall.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.640
It's very likely we'll be
leaving in a hurry.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.600
Your Majesty,
may I apologize...

34:28.760 --> 34:30.880
Nonsense, nonsense.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.120
It was all just sport! Please...

34:39.360 --> 34:41.600
A medicinal.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.600
The horn renders it
twice as efficacious.

35:09.280 --> 35:13.160
-Exquisite, is it not?
-Hmm.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.840
It represents the serpent
in the Garden,

35:16.000 --> 35:17.840
reminding us to be watchful

35:18.000 --> 35:21.400
for the poison tongue
of flatterers and deceivers.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.800
Is there part of your collection
you keep from the public eye?

35:27.320 --> 35:30.600
Is there something in particular
you wish to see?

35:32.760 --> 35:35.360
I hear you possess a book,

35:35.520 --> 35:38.480
one that contains the secrets of

35:38.640 --> 35:40.520
life itself.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.600
Lately, La Diosa,

35:46.760 --> 35:51.240
my trust and generosity
has been much abused

35:51.400 --> 35:54.840
by dissemblers
and liars.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.400
Many of you expressed surprise

36:05.560 --> 36:09.520
when I invited a Jewish mystic
into my court.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.400
But you need not have worried.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.680
This Jew has no arcane talent
beyond the typical low cunning

36:15.840 --> 36:17.840
of his people.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.080
Is that not so, Rabbi?

36:27.520 --> 36:29.600
As you say, Your Majesty.

36:32.560 --> 36:35.000
Get this deceiver
out of my sight.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.400
If I did have this book
you speak of,

36:43.560 --> 36:45.000
why would I give it to you?

36:45.160 --> 36:48.680
A prying English spy
and charlatan?

37:07.280 --> 37:09.080
I am no charlatan.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.640
You...

37:23.800 --> 37:26.320
You are magnificent.

37:26.480 --> 37:30.360
Anything you want, anything,
anything, name it.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.360
Show me the Book.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.560
This is an outrage.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.480
Kelley is an Englishman
under the Queen's protection.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.520
You had your chance. Edward.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.480
-Let La Diosa see the book.
-No.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.440
It is screaming.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.840
It won't stop screaming

39:06.000 --> 39:07.760
in my head!

39:17.520 --> 39:19.920
It is screaming.

39:22.080 --> 39:25.840
You may have Kelley, Shadow.
I no longer need him.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.960
I have found something
much more precious.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.320
The Book!

39:45.760 --> 39:48.760
It won't
stop screaming.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.240
No!

39:50.400 --> 39:52.240
Give me the book.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.880
Lock it! This way!

39:59.040 --> 40:01.880
Stop them!

40:47.280 --> 40:48.840
Go! Let's go!

40:56.560 --> 40:58.680
-Where is Jack?
-Francoise is waiting with him,

40:58.840 --> 41:01.000
two miles north.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.800
Pierre.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.240
This book is made
from the skin of creatures.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.920
-Matthew...
-Witches', daemons, vampires...

41:13.080 --> 41:15.920
The ink is made from our blood. The
pages are bound together with our hair.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.440
I'm sorry, Diana, but this is more
like a book of death.

41:18.600 --> 41:21.000
Matthew, we have to go.

41:34.120 --> 41:37.240
Absence and desire.

41:38.520 --> 41:41.080
Blood and fear...

41:43.960 --> 41:48.440
I can still hear the book
screaming.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.960
Quiet!
No one cares about your book.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
I care about your book,

42:18.160 --> 42:19.560
Edward.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.000
Most of the items
from Rudolf II's kunstkammer

42:27.160 --> 42:30.080
now reside in different
collections across the world.

42:30.240 --> 42:33.920
But here we have some of the writings
made by the English alchemist

42:34.080 --> 42:36.360
Edward Kelley
while he was imprisoned.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.840
Most are illegible however.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.840
And the mysterious
"Screaming Book" he mentions

42:42.000 --> 42:45.080
has never been
conclusively identified.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.640
Edward Kelly claims to have
bequeathed a single page

43:04.800 --> 43:06.520
to each of the three species.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.000
<i>If we could fine one.</i>

43:08.160 --> 43:10.360
Becca, what are you
trying to tell us?

43:10.520 --> 43:13.080
This is the property of
Knights of Lazarus.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.240
I am Grandmaster of the Knights.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.360
And I'm Princess Leia.

43:17.520 --> 43:20.720
...where you will find
the questions.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.600
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.480
I trust you're here
with solid information.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.080
I've established a connection
I think will interest you.

43:27.240 --> 43:30.000
A baby, a witch born to daemons.

43:30.160 --> 43:34.400
If this is true,
the witches are with the child.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.240
I'd hate to assume you a part

43:36.400 --> 43:39.000
of some de Clermont conspiracy
involving blood rage.

43:39.160 --> 43:42.560
Whatever you know,
you should tell me. Now.
