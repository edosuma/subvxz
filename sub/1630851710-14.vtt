"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:02.751 --> 00:07.292
I think it'd be really fun
to get our family together

00:07.292 --> 00:09.459
so we can celebrate
our engagement.

00:09.459 --> 00:10.876
Yes, I love that.

00:10.876 --> 00:13.918
My boyfriend--he has
a live streaming fitness app.

00:13.918 --> 00:15.292
They're doing, like,
a photo shoot.

00:15.292 --> 00:17.542
He asked James,
and James responded, "For free?"

00:17.542 --> 00:18.417

00:18.417 --> 00:20.626
We had a meeting
for the sandwich shop.

00:20.626 --> 00:22.209
Okay, so you're gonna pitch it
to Randall.

00:22.209 --> 00:24.792
Yeah. The name is...

Mmm.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.834

-I haven't seen it.

00:30.834 --> 00:31.792

What the [bleep] is going on
with you and Brock?

00:37.584 --> 00:40.751
-Are you guys getting married?
-I got a couple dresses because

00:40.751 --> 00:42.083
we talked about it doing it--

00:42.083 --> 00:43.459
So you've been planning this
secretly.

-I wanna step away one day,

00:48.417 --> 00:49.876
and you're gonna marry me
and Scheana,

00:49.876 --> 00:52.000

03:10.334 --> 03:12.792
is meeting
Raquel's mom in person,

03:12.792 --> 03:15.250
my mom got drunk at Thanksgiving
at Raquel's mom's house,

03:15.250 --> 03:17.125
yelling, just being extra.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.501

-Yeah.

I'm sorry. I don't need to get
advice from ----ing Brock.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.501
He was clueless,

just ----ing big and clueless.

All I want is communication,

the other night.

08:01.167 --> 08:04.501
100%. He needs to get better
at talking about his feelings,

08:04.501 --> 08:06.417
because, like,
the whole root of it

08:06.417 --> 08:08.000
was he feels that y'all aren't
as close anymore.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.501
Exactly.

08:09.501 --> 08:11.751
I was trying to be quiet
with him about it to the side.

08:11.751 --> 08:13.584
-I know. I know. I--
-And then it blew up in my face.

08:13.584 --> 08:15.584
-I'm like, look, here we go.
-Yeah, dude, I--

08:15.584 --> 08:20.083
James need to get his anger
under control.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.292
He can't blame it on the alcohol
anymore,

08:22.292 --> 08:25.626

at the people he's closest to.

08:25.626 --> 08:27.959

an addiction problem,

12:36.501 --> 12:40.000

this isn't a marriage
I wanna continue.

I'm not gonna be late again.

17:03.542 --> 17:07.375

my house by a freaking notary.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.250
But now my mortgage
is $3,000 a month cheaper,

17:09.250 --> 17:12.918

worth it.

17:44.792 --> 17:45.918

17:45.918 --> 17:50.250

$100,000 to $200,000.

17:50.250 --> 17:53.876
Okay. $100,000 to $200,000--
that's a big gap.

17:53.876 --> 17:56.876

"Guys, I'm in.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.125

-But--

18:18.125 --> 18:19.501

"Hold on.

18:19.501 --> 18:21.626

-It's good.

-Business.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.959
Trying to make a decision
based on numbers.

18:30.959 --> 18:33.292
Numbers are everything. We're
not doing it for love, are we?

18:33.292 --> 18:34.459
-Correct.
-If we're gonna do it for love,

18:34.459 --> 18:36.292
we're gonna have a charity,
right?

18:36.292 --> 18:38.375
-Exactly. [laughs]
-And I've got one of those.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.626

18:40.626 --> 18:42.709

why I should be part of this.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.292
-Mm-hmm.
-[laughs]

18:47.292 --> 18:50.125
Since I was, um, thrown out
of other restaurants in this--

18:50.125 --> 18:52.083
-Well, same.
-Oh, right.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.459
But--But we have that
in common.

18:53.459 --> 18:56.459
So maybe, you know,
through the ashes, we rise.

18:56.459 --> 18:57.876
-Yeah.
-And, uh, and hopefully,

18:57.876 --> 18:59.083
the numbers make sense

18:59.083 --> 19:01.667
with my team, and if they do,
I'd love to be part of this.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.209

19:03.209 --> 19:04.709
Randall's into the idea.

to wait and see,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.584

haven't moved forward.

texted me.

it feels like a magical castle,

29:04.542 --> 29:06.709

upon my wine kingdom.

like, 10 minutes?

-Like, five minutes.
-Yeah. All right.

29:18.042 --> 29:19.459

a little later.

James Kennedy needs to go

29:32.167 --> 29:34.501
on a wine tour. [laughs]
-Of course not.

29:34.501 --> 29:36.542
He doesn't need
to experience the tannins.

29:36.542 --> 29:39.459
Have you seen or talked to James
since, like, the other night

29:39.459 --> 29:42.125
when he was losing it?

29:42.125 --> 29:43.709
I mean, a little bit,
I texted with him.

29:43.709 --> 29:46.250
He was, I don't know,
giving me some attitude.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.667
It's just, the whole thing

29:47.667 --> 29:49.292
just really rubbed me
the wrong way.

29:49.292 --> 29:51.375
-Like, at Schwartz & Sandy's...
-Yeah.

29:51.375 --> 29:52.626
When him and Brock, like,
got into it,

29:52.626 --> 29:56.792
and me and Raquel and Katie were
at the other end of the bar,

29:56.792 --> 30:01.042
at one point, like, he came over
and he, like, grabbed her wrist.

30:01.042 --> 30:04.209
All right, all right.
I wanna go.

30:04.209 --> 30:07.125
I called her on FaceTime,
and then he was, like,

30:07.125 --> 30:09.751
really rude to me
on the phone as well.

30:09.751 --> 30:12.959
I was curious if I could talk
to you in private.

30:12.959 --> 30:15.751
Yeah, James just left the room.

30:15.751 --> 30:18.042
When he came over to us, and he,
like, grabbed your wrist

30:18.042 --> 30:20.042
and was like, "We're going,"

30:20.042 --> 30:22.542
that sh-- does not ----ing fly
with me.

30:22.542 --> 30:24.959
When you're--When you're done
ranting about me,

30:24.959 --> 30:27.417
maybe you should just think
about your own vice.

30:27.417 --> 30:29.042
You know,
you can only take so much,

30:29.042 --> 30:31.459
and then you're just like,
"Dude, you're not in a bad mood.

30:31.459 --> 30:33.125
You're not going through a funk.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.292
This is just like
a personality trait of yours."

41:51.000 --> 41:52.375
because I already had it.

41:52.375 --> 41:54.834
-I'm very ----ing paranoid.
-Clearly.

41:54.834 --> 41:57.083
But at the same time,

41:57.083 --> 41:59.501
James and Raquel already had
a whole weekend in Palm Springs.

41:59.501 --> 42:01.501
I can take a little time
for myself.

42:01.501 --> 42:05.125
Like, mom and dad--we gotta
tie the knot, you know?

42:05.125 --> 42:08.292
Let's move forward
optimistically

42:08.292 --> 42:10.667
like it can happen.
I'll figure it out.

42:10.667 --> 42:13.125
♪♪♪

42:13.125 --> 42:16.292
Next time on the season finale
of "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:16.292 --> 42:18.083
One, two, three.

42:18.083 --> 42:18.959
ALL: Boat life!

42:18.959 --> 42:20.792
[cheering]

42:20.792 --> 42:22.334
I'm on a boat, bitch.

42:22.334 --> 42:25.167
-Alpacas!
-Oh, they're mating.

42:25.167 --> 42:27.584
That's what Randall sounds like
when he wants to mate.

42:27.584 --> 42:28.667
[grunts]

42:28.667 --> 42:29.959
Aah!

42:29.959 --> 42:32.000
Scheana and I have something
to tell you guys.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.542
We got engaged a few days ago.

42:34.542 --> 42:36.876
Good job. You're so cool.

42:36.876 --> 42:38.542
I know. I'll teach you how
to be cool later, bitch.

42:38.542 --> 42:41.167
Oh, babe, I was born
----ing cool.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.083
I don't understand the delay.

42:43.083 --> 42:45.000
You're adding stress. Like,
I feel stressed out sometimes

42:45.000 --> 42:46.334
when I talk to you about this.

42:46.334 --> 42:47.959
You asked my advice.
I'm giving it to you.

42:47.959 --> 42:50.334
-Feeling kinda shaky right now.
-Why? Why?

42:50.334 --> 42:51.834
Well, because Brock and Scheana
announced

42:51.834 --> 42:53.626
they were planning
to get married,

42:53.626 --> 42:55.083
like, during this weekend.

42:55.083 --> 42:58.751
Whatever, bro! Oh, my God! Yes!

42:58.751 --> 43:02.751
Stay right there.
