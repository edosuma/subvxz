WEBVTT

00:44.127 --> 00:46.630
If I can pretend to be happy, so can they.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.969
Sixty years of socialism will wipe
the smile off anyone's face, comrade.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.390
Sergei Orestovich Nikulov.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.145
-Sergei Orestovich Nikulov.
-Margo Madison.

01:02.646 --> 01:05.022
-Sergei Orestovich Nikulov.
-Thomas Paine.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.485
-Sergei Orestovich Nikulov.
-Ellen Wilson.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.028
-Thomas Paine.
-Pleasure.

01:19.037 --> 01:22.958
I'm sorry, I don't really speak fluently.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.504
Okay. Hi.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.630
-Welcome.
-Hello.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.174
Hello.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.427
Danielle Poole, Apollo commander.
Welcome to Houston.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.180
Stepan Petrovich Alekseev,
Soyuz commander.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.140
Exciting day, isn't it?

01:38.223 --> 01:41.852
This is gonna be a great mission for our
two countries and for the whole world.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.698
At approximately 0700 hours,

01:54.781 --> 01:58.869
the respective spacecraft
will be in position

01:58.952 --> 02:02.915
with the docking module mated
to the Apollo command module.

02:02.998 --> 02:08.628
Soyuz will execute a 60-degree roll
maneuver and then maintain attitude

02:08.711 --> 02:12.883
while Apollo maneuvers
along the V-BAR until contact.

02:12.966 --> 02:18.305
And soft capture will complete
the final docking procedure.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.397
Any questions so far?

02:31.068 --> 02:36.573
Hard-docking will be followed
by main chamber pressure equalization.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.035
Astronaut One will enter
the docking module from the Apollo craft

02:40.118 --> 02:41.245
and close their hatch.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.957
Astronaut Two remains
at the command module controls.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.127
And from Soyuz, Astronaut Three will
open their hatch to the docking module,

02:49.211 --> 02:52.589
while Astronaut Four
also remains at the control--

02:58.345 --> 03:03.600
Cosmonauts should not be referred to as
"Astronaut Three" and "Astronaut Four,"

03:03.684 --> 03:05.853
as though they are afterthoughts.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.897
We would suggest "Cosmonaut One"
and "Cosmonaut Two."

03:12.317 --> 03:13.485
Sure.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.279
Sorry.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.198
The terminology is purely
for the sake of convenience,

03:18.282 --> 03:21.076
but I will make that adjustment.

03:21.159 --> 03:25.873
We would also suggest
"Soyuz-Apollo" as the name of the mission.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.709
For the sake of convenience.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.297
Sorry.

03:35.799 --> 03:40.429
Let's move on
to ship-to-ship communications.

03:40.512 --> 03:45.475
Our astronauts and your cosmonauts will
need to be able to talk to each other.

03:45.559 --> 03:49.104
Agreed.
What is your RF encryption protocol?

03:55.694 --> 03:59.615
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.957
You first.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.045
Okay.

04:14.046 --> 04:19.676
Maybe we should just talk about
something very basic.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.346
The docking itself.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.723
It seems like the most logical approach

04:24.806 --> 04:28.060
would be for you to provide us
with your Soyuz docking system,

04:28.143 --> 04:30.187
which we can install on our module.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.898
The Apollo side
will be the active mechanism,

04:32.981 --> 04:34.733
and the Soyuz will be passive and--

04:34.816 --> 04:37.277
The Soyuz side
will be the active mechanism,

04:37.361 --> 04:39.279
and the Apollo side will be passive.

04:39.905 --> 04:44.159
That would require a complete redesign
on our part.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.663
Yes.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.300
Jesus, what was that?

05:00.384 --> 05:01.635
Reschedule everything.

05:01.718 --> 05:02.928
Paine here.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.055
Yes, Senator, my apologies.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.558
Four hours closer to the heat death
of the universe,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.852
I'll be damned if I know
what we accomplished.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.855
Well, that's progress, Soviet-style.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.816
They won't spec us. We won't spec them.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.485
If we can't share
the most basic information,

05:18.569 --> 05:20.195
how are we supposed to get anywhere?

05:20.571 --> 05:21.989
We're not.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.324
What?

05:27.578 --> 05:31.123
Look, nothing would make
the Pentagon any happier.

05:31.206 --> 05:35.544
Just string this thing along till
the Soviets take their ball and go home,

05:35.627 --> 05:37.796
or the president forgets
he gave his approval

05:37.880 --> 05:40.174
for this crazy idea in the first place.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.552
-Oh, my God.
-This is great.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.555
Just great.

05:46.638 --> 05:51.894
Margo, I for one am confident
in your ability to make things not happen.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.117
Make ready.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.122
Fire.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.667
Careful, Fred Astaire.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.629
Action's still pretty awkward
in these suits.

07:45.883 --> 07:46.925
Range is clear.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.178
Charles, check the target.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.565
Maggie's drawers.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.775
Really? No.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.569
Maggie's drawers?

08:05.652 --> 08:09.072
-Means he completely missed the target.
-Missed the backstop too.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.449
Come on!

08:10.532 --> 08:13.493
-Any idea where it went?
-Nothing I can see.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.747
Could be in orbit.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.751
No one's ever shot a rifle here before, so

08:20.834 --> 08:24.922
for all we know
that bullet might be going round the moon

08:25.714 --> 08:28.926
and coming right back around
in a short while.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.763
I mean, who knows, really?

08:32.846 --> 08:34.556
But, Vance,

08:34.640 --> 08:36.475
just to be safe,

08:36.558 --> 08:39.561
I wouldn't stand in that same spot
if I were you.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.747
-Shit.
-Don't look at me.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.123
She got you.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.503
Come on, Vance. Stick to shooting.

09:07.798 --> 09:11.343
Jamestown control,
LSAM 2 has cleared the pad.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.178
How's the ride out there, y'all?

09:13.262 --> 09:15.514
Sweet. I can almost feel
the wind in my hair.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.683
I can almost feel
that thruster on my face.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.936
All right. Now, that shadow
down in Shackleton,

09:21.019 --> 09:24.064
that'll simulate night
for our practice run.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.362
For the real deal,
we'd wanna come in fast and low,

09:30.445 --> 09:32.406
so the Russians won't have time to react.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.490
Copy that.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.118
How close to the canyon floor
do you think we can get?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.996
I could probably
get you down to five meters.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.664
Five meters?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.124
Well, that's me.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.168
I've had a lot of stick time
on this beast.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.837
I wouldn't recommend
y'all go lower than 20.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.881
Yeah, I don't wanna go lower than 20.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.304
All right, we're in line
for the final run. You ready?

09:55.387 --> 09:56.722
Ready.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.142
You have the spacecraft. No fancy shit.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.727
Copy that.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.811
Whoa, now.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.397
All right. You're in no hurry.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.150
Just a straight shot from here.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.027
Twelve o'clock all the way.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.697
We're gonna do a couple of low passes,

10:13.780 --> 10:15.866
and then we're gonna try
to land, all right?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.705
Watch your roll rates.
You're overcompensating.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.124
-Hang on.
-Jesus, Bernitz.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.501
I got this.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.212
I got it. Shit.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.713
I got the vehicle.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.383
-Damn it.
-What the hell was that?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.636
Are you
drinking and driving again, Bernitz?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.765
Yeah, that's funny.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.850
Tricky beast.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.353
Tricky beast.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.856
All right. Tracy,
you take us in for the rest of this run.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.901
Charles, we'll have to find
some more stick time for you later.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.946
-Roger that.
-Roger.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.572
Okay.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.075
You've heard the expression
"crap rolls downhill."

10:58.158 --> 11:00.619
And this is now officially
the bottom of the hill.

11:01.203 --> 11:04.289
We've gotta come up with a totally new
design for the module's docking system

11:04.373 --> 11:07.084
that's not based on
either preexisting system.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.380
I keep telling ya,
don't raise your hand, Vic.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.298
This isn't high school.
What's your question?

11:14.216 --> 11:17.845
So, you want us to design
a new docking system from scratch?

11:17.928 --> 11:19.221
That's the mandate.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.557
The bosses want it, and they want it fast.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.102
Without any Soyuz
structural interface data?

11:27.020 --> 11:30.858
I want first proposals
on my console by morning.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.405
-How are we supposed to--
-I heard you the first time.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.740
So, yeah, so why didn't you
answer me the first time?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.660
That is a design issue
for the design team,

11:41.743 --> 11:43.704
which you are not on.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.540
If Design has a question,
they will ask it.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.293
I put you on Ops
because that's your skill set.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.421
Stay in your lane, Aleida. Please.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.145
Tom.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.189
-Don't say it.
-Please make this go away.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.024
-No.
-Nobody wants to do it.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.735
-The president does.
-Come on. I doubt he even remembers it.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.862
You could shitcan this thing
in five minutes.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.947
You're probably right. But I won't.

12:19.990 --> 12:20.991
I want to do it.

12:21.909 --> 12:22.951
Why?

12:24.745 --> 12:27.664
The handshake in space
is my shining city on a hill.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.583
Your what?

12:29.666 --> 12:33.045
City on a hill. You know, John Winthrop.

12:34.129 --> 12:38.592
"We shall be a shining city on a hill,
with eyes of the world upon us."

12:38.675 --> 12:42.596
But this time the eyes of the world will
be lifted to our shining city in the sky.

12:43.639 --> 12:47.226
Four astronauts and two capsules
do not a city make.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.311
You're missing the point.
This is for history.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.689
Someday people will write
the history of this time,

12:52.773 --> 12:56.485
and they will say that during
the coldest depths of the Cold War,

12:56.568 --> 12:58.987
when the competition for space
was at its fiercest,

12:59.071 --> 13:02.032
America and the Soviet Union
put aside their differences

13:02.115 --> 13:07.079
and joined together in a symbolic gesture
that inspired the world

13:07.162 --> 13:10.290
and helped lay the foundations
for reconciliation

13:10.374 --> 13:13.544
and peaceful coexistence
between the superpowers.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.423
You really believe that?

13:19.091 --> 13:22.594
Anything is possible.
But America must lead by example.

13:23.762 --> 13:27.140
The president himself said so.
"City on a hill."

13:27.224 --> 13:30.310
We didn't build that city, but we have to
do our best to make it sparkle.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.104
Then we need to blink first.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.064
No. No can do.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.817
Force them to compromise,
or find some win-win scenario.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.862
-Like what?
-I don't know. That's your job.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.783
Shoot.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.869
Protesters across the country

13:46.952 --> 13:48.829
have decried the launch as dangerous

13:48.912 --> 13:50.414
due to the nature of the cargo,

13:50.497 --> 13:53.458
which contains a much-needed resupply
of nuclear fuel

13:53.542 --> 13:55.961
for the Jamestown lunar base.

13:56.044 --> 14:00.674
We will now take you live to the US
missile range at Guam for the countdown.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.553
Look at that. A lot of security out there.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.889
They got a whole carrier task force.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.515
Well, it doesn't seem very safe.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.642
What if that thing explodes
in the atmosphere?

14:10.726 --> 14:13.353
...phase three expansion
of the Jamestown colony.

14:13.437 --> 14:16.440
That's why we're launching
from the middle of nowhere, Karen.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.358
Look, it's risky, Ed. All right?

14:18.442 --> 14:21.153
It's not just another payload.
That thing's carrying plutonium.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.571
...two, one.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.906
Ignition.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.932
See?

14:50.015 --> 14:54.228
No fiery, radioactive explosion.
It's just another day at the office.

14:54.811 --> 14:55.854
Hooray.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.273
It looks as though
the immense American supply rocket

14:58.357 --> 15:00.150
has cleared the missile range,

15:00.234 --> 15:02.819
leading many to breathe a sigh of relief.

15:02.903 --> 15:03.946
Hey, Dad?

15:04.613 --> 15:07.032
What'd you write your essay about
when you got in?

15:07.115 --> 15:09.576
Oh, God. That was such a long time ago.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.454
Probably something about
why I wanted to go to Annapolis.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.541
Thanks, Dad.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.294
Look, just... tell 'em who you are.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.921
They'll love you.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.966
...as the crisis in Panama
continues to unfold.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.676
As the main resupply rocket...

15:25.759 --> 15:28.345
Okay. Who am I?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.806
...element of the American space program.

15:30.889 --> 15:34.726
The Panama Canal is the only possible
route for the rocket to reach Guam

15:34.810 --> 15:37.855
as it is too large to be moved over land.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.941
But after the daring rescue
of US servicemen,

15:41.024 --> 15:43.527
which resulted in the deaths
of two Panamanian guards...

15:45.153 --> 15:46.363
Why did you adopt me?

15:51.243 --> 15:52.244
Come on, Kel.

15:53.412 --> 15:56.707
You know this.
Must've told you a thousand times.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.504
When we walked into that adoption center,

16:02.588 --> 16:05.591
and we saw you sitting by the window,

16:06.216 --> 16:09.011
helping one of the younger kids
put together a puzzle.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.930
You were so kind and patient.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.184
I mean, we knew right away.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.188
-Yeah, it was love at first sight.
-Yeah.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.026
No, I mean,

16:24.109 --> 16:25.944
why didn't you have another baby?

16:33.076 --> 16:34.661
Well, Kelly...

16:36.079 --> 16:37.956
it was difficult.

16:38.707 --> 16:43.629
I had some... medical issues,
and I didn't think I could.

16:44.588 --> 16:47.007
Then we saw this report on the news.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.092
They called it Operation Babylift.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.596
Yeah, you called me from the Shamrock
while it was still on TV.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.014
Yeah, I remember.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.893
Yeah, we watched it together
over the phone.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.398
The Shamrock Hotel?

17:06.276 --> 17:08.319
That's, like, ten minutes away.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.491
Yeah, I stayed there for a while.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.451
It was temporary.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.669
Were you guys separated?

17:27.631 --> 17:29.716
We were going through a rough spot.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.554
After Shane died.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.765
Yeah.

17:38.392 --> 17:41.144
We still loved each other very much.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.483
But every time we looked at each other
all we saw was him.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.320
And then we saw that report on TV.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.197
All those children from Vietnam

17:52.281 --> 17:56.326
that were brought over here
in the hope of finding them a better life.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.829
That's all we talked about
that whole car ride.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.040
We were so excited.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.502
It was the most that we had spoken
to each other in weeks.

18:07.671 --> 18:08.672
Yeah.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.219
So, I was your...

18:16.221 --> 18:17.222
Band-Aid.

18:21.727 --> 18:22.728
What? No.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.814
You were not a Band-Aid, Kelly.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.233
Honey, you were our heart transplant.

18:28.817 --> 18:29.943
Yeah.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.829
It's okay, Mom.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.064
I did not know
we were supposed to bring gifts.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.649
Neither did I.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.237
Thank you. Very nice.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.999
I would love to know
a little bit more about you both.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.753
What drew you to the space program?

19:38.136 --> 19:41.557
-All right. Why don't I start out?
-Yeah.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.392
Okay.

19:44.726 --> 19:49.314
Well, I always loved flying.
Ever since I was a little girl.

19:50.482 --> 19:55.404
My father taught me. He was a cargo pilot
in Memphis, Tennessee.

19:55.487 --> 19:58.407
Something about being up there
in the clouds

19:58.490 --> 20:01.743
always makes me feel
like I'm still close to him.

20:03.912 --> 20:07.624
And then when NASA opened up
the program to female astronauts,

20:07.708 --> 20:10.627
well, I just jumped at the chance.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.842
I was in Soviet Air Force.

20:18.427 --> 20:21.930
Selected for cosmonaut training
by superior officer.

20:23.640 --> 20:24.933
Joined program.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.362
-Food's here.
-Thank God.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.490
Now this is

20:40.574 --> 20:45.162
borscht and piroshki from
the best Russian restaurant in town.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.456
The only Russian restaurant in town.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.927
Is there a problem? Is there
something wrong with the food?

21:02.721 --> 21:05.390
We would like

21:05.474 --> 21:06.850
hamburgers.

21:09.478 --> 21:10.562
Hamburgers?

21:15.275 --> 21:17.402
Here you go. Good to see you, Dani.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.489
Can I get you guys anything to drink?

21:22.658 --> 21:23.659
Vodka?

21:26.787 --> 21:29.831
Do you have Jack Daniel's?

21:31.667 --> 21:33.752
Yeah, think we can track that down.

21:53.981 --> 21:56.483
To Apollo-Soyuz.

21:57.442 --> 21:58.443
No.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.614
To Soyuz-Apollo?

22:02.698 --> 22:06.451
No, no, there is an order to the toasting.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.871
First, to fallen comrades.

22:08.954 --> 22:10.747
To Vladimir Komarov,

22:10.831 --> 22:15.085
Viktor Patsayev, Georgy Dobrovolsky,
to Vladislav Volkov.

22:15.169 --> 22:17.462
Soyuz 1, Soyuz 11?

22:19.590 --> 22:20.591
All right.

22:22.426 --> 22:25.304
To Gus, Ed and Roger.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.139
Apollo 1.

22:28.849 --> 22:33.437
To Patty, Harry... Deke.

22:43.197 --> 22:46.450
If you had mixed nitrogen
with your oxygen like Soviets,

22:46.533 --> 22:50.662
perhaps Apollo 1 astronauts
would still be alive.

22:56.251 --> 23:00.047
And maybe if your cosmonauts on Soyuz 11

23:00.130 --> 23:03.509
had worn pressure suits during reentry
like Americans do,

23:03.592 --> 23:05.135
they'd still be alive too.

23:07.721 --> 23:09.389
Or maybe we could just say

23:09.973 --> 23:11.099
shit happens.

23:12.100 --> 23:16.313
I hope shit doesn't happen when we
are 200 kilometers above the planet.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.608
So, what's the next toast?

23:24.279 --> 23:27.533
The second toast is... to the women.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.702
I'm the only one here.

23:34.873 --> 23:39.169
It is a plural. To the women,
all the women in the world.

23:40.587 --> 23:43.549
To the ladies. I can drink to that.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.857
I really love being with you,
I do, but I'm just...

24:02.025 --> 24:03.819
I don't know what's gonna happen here.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.823
And I'm not going to toss
my whole life aside for you again.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.870
I'm not asking you to.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.290
I just--

24:16.707 --> 24:20.419
I don't know. That we could
keep figuring out what this is.

24:22.129 --> 24:23.755
This is an affair.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.883
That's what this is.

24:27.342 --> 24:28.844
It doesn't have to be just that.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.015
I'm serious.

24:37.436 --> 24:38.812
Honestly, it's...

24:45.235 --> 24:47.779
It's just... it's hard--

24:54.494 --> 24:56.079
It's hard to trust you.

24:57.331 --> 24:59.374
After everything that happened, I...

25:03.420 --> 25:06.757
-I was in a different place back then.
-You're still at NASA.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.009
What, are they more accepting

25:09.092 --> 25:12.846
of alternative lifestyles
in the Reagan administration?

25:19.144 --> 25:20.771
Who says I have to stay at NASA?

25:20.854 --> 25:23.023
-You just got a promotion.
-I don't care.

25:24.733 --> 25:25.734
I don't.

25:30.364 --> 25:31.365
I know what I want.

25:31.448 --> 25:35.160
And it's not a promotion,
and it's not NASA,

25:35.244 --> 25:38.413
and it's not any other thing
in this world but you.

25:38.497 --> 25:39.998
And I don't care who knows it.

25:40.082 --> 25:42.167
Ellen. This is not the place.

25:42.251 --> 25:43.418
I don't care anymore.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.300
I love you.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.182
I love you.

25:58.392 --> 26:01.562
I couldn't say it ten years ago,
and I lost you,

26:01.645 --> 26:07.693
but I'm saying it now, and I am ready
to do whatever it takes to keep you.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.044
You're a public figure.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.380
I don't want Elise finding out about this

26:28.463 --> 26:30.465
because someone saw us
holding hands in a park.

26:30.966 --> 26:31.967
That's fair.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.640
You gonna tell Elise?

26:45.439 --> 26:46.481
You gonna tell Larry?

26:47.357 --> 26:48.358
Yeah.

26:50.319 --> 26:51.570
Yeah, I guess I am.

26:53.155 --> 26:55.782
I have to tell my husband
I'm leaving him for another woman.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.746
This is a weird life.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.666
Yes, it is.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.254
AR data looks good.

27:09.338 --> 27:12.341
Copy. Taking AR data to GNC.

27:12.424 --> 27:15.302
-I see it.
-Okay. HUD power on.

27:15.385 --> 27:16.512
Copy that.

27:16.595 --> 27:21.308
Speed, Mach 0.98. We are subsonic.
Two minutes from touchdown.

27:21.391 --> 27:24.144
Copy that. Taking manual control.

27:27.439 --> 27:30.901
She feels good. Let's see how she flies.

27:32.486 --> 27:35.989
Passing 14,000. Speed, 390 knots.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.366
Pathfinder, Kennedy.

27:37.449 --> 27:41.745
Weather aircraft reports unexpected
heavy clouds moving in at 9,000.

27:41.828 --> 27:42.913
All right, Mr. Piscotty,

27:42.996 --> 27:47.960
check your flight controller power is on
and nose wheel steering set to one.

27:48.043 --> 27:49.294
Verified.

27:49.378 --> 27:52.506
KSC runway 33 should be out
your window as we come around the HAC.

27:52.589 --> 27:53.841
Call field in sight.

27:56.885 --> 28:01.515
All right, we're in the clouds now.
Flying blind. On instruments from here.

28:03.267 --> 28:06.520
IMU-2 is showing us two kilometers right
of our landing path.

28:08.647 --> 28:11.316
Other units show zero error.
Must be malfunctioning.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.947
Primary flight computers
three and four have failed to sync.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.490
One and two are still good.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.493
Okay, Mr. Piscotty, you're me.

28:21.577 --> 28:23.370
What do you do next?

28:24.872 --> 28:26.915
Take computers three and four off-line.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.172
Now how are we looking?

28:34.506 --> 28:38.969
On centerline and on glide slope.
8,000 feet, 307 knots.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.846
Coming right down the middle, skipper.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.389
Is that right?

28:42.472 --> 28:45.392
Looks to me like
we're about to feed the alligators.

28:46.143 --> 28:47.144
So...

28:51.857 --> 28:53.483
Now, tell me why I did that.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.777
It's something about the navigation units.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.947
Which IMU is the backup computer using
to guide us down?

28:59.031 --> 29:01.158
Three and four are off.
It's gotta be one or two.

29:01.241 --> 29:04.036
IMU-2, which showed us
too far to the right. We can't trust it.

29:12.461 --> 29:15.339
You changed our course to the right
to compensate for the error.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.090
And...

29:20.511 --> 29:22.471
straight down the fucking middle.

29:42.199 --> 29:43.200
Hello?

29:45.327 --> 29:46.495
Come in, please.

29:51.124 --> 29:52.501
Working late?

29:54.336 --> 29:55.796
Sorry to interrupt.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.216
Writing reports to Moscow.

30:02.302 --> 30:05.138
Bureaucrats, they love their reports.

30:06.223 --> 30:09.017
Do not know what they do with them,
but they love to get them.

30:09.101 --> 30:10.269
Sounds familiar.

30:11.103 --> 30:14.439
Might help if you played something
a little more lively.

30:15.607 --> 30:18.193
I keep waiting for them
to play something else, but...

30:18.277 --> 30:20.696
There's more than one radio station
in Houston.

30:20.779 --> 30:24.741
Top 40, country-western, jazz.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.329
It would not be wise

30:29.413 --> 30:32.499
for me to be listening to
non-politically approved music at work.

30:37.754 --> 30:38.755
Right.

30:45.512 --> 30:51.310
We need to find a way around
this roadblock with the docking mechanism.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.730
It is not negotiable
and cannot be worked around.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.649
Sergei, this whole mission is predicated

30:57.733 --> 31:01.403
on our being able to dock
our two ships together in some way.

31:04.531 --> 31:06.658
One might even believe Soyuz-Apollo

31:06.742 --> 31:09.494
is a ruse to obtain Soviet specifications

31:10.078 --> 31:13.248
solely to give Americans
a military edge in space.

31:13.332 --> 31:16.084
I assure you, it is an advantage
you will not keep for long.

31:21.673 --> 31:23.008
If that's what you believe,

31:23.800 --> 31:27.012
you should pack your bags
and head back to Moscow.

31:35.729 --> 31:36.730
Good night.

32:17.521 --> 32:20.399
That was certainly lively.

32:22.401 --> 32:24.528
I'll take that as a compliment.

32:25.487 --> 32:26.780
As I intended.

32:27.614 --> 32:31.660
Wasn't sure if you'd be able
to give your babysitter the slip.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.457
They know I would never defect.

32:38.083 --> 32:43.839
I'm on a long leash, and I know
enough not to bite the hand that holds it.

32:48.427 --> 32:49.803
This is a secret place for you?

32:50.387 --> 32:51.430
What makes you say that?

32:52.556 --> 32:55.851
It would seem unwise for us to meet
at a place where we might be recognized.

32:56.435 --> 32:58.729
I don't see any of your colleagues.

32:59.313 --> 33:00.772
It...

33:02.399 --> 33:04.818
is a secret place for me.

33:06.945 --> 33:08.238
But not because of the music?

33:08.822 --> 33:11.200
No, not the music. I...

33:14.119 --> 33:17.831
just don't choose to share
this part of my life with many people.

33:19.541 --> 33:20.792
It's private.

33:21.668 --> 33:23.754
Something I do for me.

33:26.507 --> 33:29.259
So, to our shared secrets.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.898
What is the meaning of this name?

33:42.981 --> 33:47.277
It refers to the Doomsday Clock.
You know, 11:59?

33:48.487 --> 33:50.739
Midnight is nuclear apocalypse.

33:51.532 --> 33:52.741
Gallows humor.

33:53.659 --> 33:55.118
Not far from the truth.

33:56.870 --> 33:58.080
One minute to midnight.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.626
Do you really think so?

34:05.963 --> 34:09.382
We have civil defense drills
in all our major cities now.

34:10.759 --> 34:13.512
They stopped during the '70s.
Now they are back.

34:13.594 --> 34:17.139
It feels very real to us.

34:20.768 --> 34:21.812
Very real.

34:23.730 --> 34:27.150
I remember doing civil defense
drills when I was a little girl.

34:28.235 --> 34:31.237
Teacher had us stack all the furniture
up against the windows

34:31.321 --> 34:34.658
to counter the blast.

34:35.534 --> 34:36.869
But then they showed us a film

34:36.952 --> 34:39.913
that said you were supposed to hide
under the desk during an attack.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.666
So, were you supposed to stack the desks
or hide under them?

34:43.333 --> 34:47.337
I used to lie in bed at night and...
think about that.

34:55.762 --> 34:59.516
So, what do we do
about our docking problem?

35:02.227 --> 35:03.437
What?

35:16.366 --> 35:17.743
Get me a knife.

35:19.077 --> 35:20.078
Okay.

35:21.872 --> 35:23.248
Soyuz.

35:23.332 --> 35:24.666
Apollo.

35:29.087 --> 35:32.090
Houston, we have docking.

35:34.426 --> 35:38.305
-Happy birthday to you
-That was yesterday, Mom.

35:38.388 --> 35:42.017
-Happy belated birthday to you
-Mom, cut it out.

35:42.100 --> 35:47.481
Tried to make some time for you
But the phone was booked up

35:48.273 --> 35:49.274
Thanks.

35:49.858 --> 35:50.859
What'd y'all do?

35:51.777 --> 35:53.070
Dad baked a cake.

35:53.153 --> 35:55.322
He baked a cake, or he bought a cake?

35:55.405 --> 35:56.448
-Yes.
-Yes, what?

35:56.532 --> 35:58.742
He baked a cake,
and then we bought a cake,

35:58.825 --> 36:00.661
because the oven wasn't working right.

36:00.744 --> 36:03.080
-So the oven's broke now?
-That's what Dad said.

36:04.248 --> 36:06.291
I wanna see a picture of this cake.

36:06.375 --> 36:08.001
We destroyed the evidence.

36:08.085 --> 36:09.419
Course you did.

36:09.503 --> 36:12.631
Oh, God. I think the last time
your father tried to bake you a cake

36:12.714 --> 36:14.216
you were six.

36:14.299 --> 36:16.927
-Do you remember that?
-Yeah, the trauma remains.

36:18.846 --> 36:21.515
Remember when you got me
the Bonanza board game

36:21.598 --> 36:23.225
for my eighth birthday?

36:23.308 --> 36:26.979
No one could figure out the rules.
So Dad just started making stuff up.

36:27.729 --> 36:30.065
He was hysterical.

36:33.151 --> 36:35.445
Your father used to make me laugh.

36:35.529 --> 36:39.491
I mean, I swear, he could just look at me
and I'd bust up sometimes.

36:41.869 --> 36:43.579
Those were happy times.

36:43.662 --> 36:46.665
-I miss those days.
-Yeah, me too.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.877
-You do?
-Sure.

36:49.960 --> 36:55.007
Yeah. I mean,
if I could go back, you know, I...

36:55.591 --> 36:57.217
Almost done, Stevens?

36:58.594 --> 37:01.847
Shit.
I'm about to run outta time, darlin'.

37:01.930 --> 37:05.350
-Bye.
-Well, I have about 30 seconds...

37:07.144 --> 37:08.812
You little shit.

38:34.147 --> 38:35.148
Any requests?

38:36.275 --> 38:39.194
I enjoy automobile crash category.

38:41.572 --> 38:43.657
I have no idea what you're talking about.

38:49.371 --> 38:50.956
Do you like dog?

38:51.957 --> 38:52.958
Dogs?

38:54.126 --> 38:56.503
Of course. Who doesn't?

38:56.587 --> 38:57.838
Not dogs.

38:57.921 --> 39:00.257
The dog. Laika.

39:02.759 --> 39:03.844
Laika.

39:04.553 --> 39:06.930
The first living being
to go to outer space.

39:07.931 --> 39:08.932
Can't top that.

39:10.058 --> 39:11.059
To Laika.

39:11.143 --> 39:12.644
I held her in my arms.

39:12.728 --> 39:14.396
For a minute or two.

39:17.065 --> 39:18.066
At the launch?

39:20.152 --> 39:22.988
As a cosmonaut candidate,
part of my training.

39:23.071 --> 39:26.116
I was still practically a boy.

39:28.911 --> 39:29.912
What was it like?

39:30.871 --> 39:32.080
What was she like?

39:34.208 --> 39:35.292
This big.

39:36.210 --> 39:38.962
Very bright eyes and very curly tail.

39:41.173 --> 39:42.799
She was pretty cute in the pictures.

39:42.883 --> 39:45.260
They put her
in "preferred" classification.

39:45.969 --> 39:49.765
Spirited but balanced,
adaptable to new situations.

39:50.933 --> 39:52.559
Sounds a lot like us.

39:53.852 --> 39:57.231
Astronauts, I mean. Cosmonauts.

39:57.314 --> 40:03.070
The data from the dog flight informed
the selection process for human beings.

40:04.780 --> 40:08.492
See? That makes it all worthwhile.

40:09.326 --> 40:12.454
Her... sacrifice.

40:13.288 --> 40:14.915
Death, you mean.

40:16.041 --> 40:20.170
When we launched her into the orbit
with no means of return.

40:22.005 --> 40:24.341
Yes. Her death.

40:33.767 --> 40:35.185
Seven days in orbit.

40:36.937 --> 40:40.649
She was the first to see the Earth
from outer space.

40:41.859 --> 40:44.319
The moon. The stars.

40:45.362 --> 40:48.198
And then peacefully went to sleep.

40:49.867 --> 40:51.285
We should be so lucky.

40:53.036 --> 40:54.329
All lies.

40:55.497 --> 40:58.417
The rocket did not separate as planned.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.043
Thermal control failed.

41:00.586 --> 41:02.171
The capsule overheated.

41:02.838 --> 41:07.551
She suffered and died a few hours later
after only... three orbits.

41:08.594 --> 41:09.595
Wow.

41:13.473 --> 41:14.683
Nobody knows that.

41:15.642 --> 41:17.019
You do now.

41:20.772 --> 41:22.107
But she was still the first.

41:22.191 --> 41:25.527
Her name will be remembered
when we are all moondust.

41:25.611 --> 41:29.907
"Sacrifice for the motherland."
It's what Pravda said.

41:31.325 --> 41:33.118
She only wanted to go home.

41:34.077 --> 41:36.705
Think about all the other dogs
who fell out

41:36.788 --> 41:40.083
because they were too spirited,

41:40.167 --> 41:43.504
too scared, too annoyed

41:43.587 --> 41:48.884
with the centrifuge, the sledge,
the confinement, hell, the shitty food.

41:49.718 --> 41:52.721
But Laika? She stuck it out.

41:52.804 --> 41:55.265
Yeah. To please her trainers.

41:55.849 --> 41:58.894
When a hundred other dogs
decided otherwise.

41:59.603 --> 42:00.687
What are you saying?

42:00.771 --> 42:03.023
I'm saying give her some credit.

42:03.565 --> 42:04.942
Some agency.

42:05.651 --> 42:08.946
She went to outer space
for the people she loved

42:09.029 --> 42:11.365
and for anybody who loved her back,

42:11.448 --> 42:16.245
including a young cosmonaut
who held her in his arms,

42:17.037 --> 42:18.413
only for a minute or two...

42:19.623 --> 42:20.999
on that launchpad.

42:23.460 --> 42:24.711
That's how she died.

42:26.088 --> 42:28.924
Not for all of humanity.

42:29.758 --> 42:32.094
For the people she loved.

42:35.931 --> 42:39.893
Just a scared little thing, in the end.

42:49.361 --> 42:50.362
To Laika.

42:50.445 --> 42:51.947
To Laika.

43:04.084 --> 43:09.214
Three capture latches
will work for the initial dock, but--

43:09.298 --> 43:11.884
But we will need at least double that
for the seal itself.

43:11.967 --> 43:12.968
At least.

43:19.099 --> 43:21.226
-Someone is sleeping in my bed!
-Hello?

43:22.269 --> 43:23.312
Hang on.

43:27.649 --> 43:28.901
Aleida?

43:30.569 --> 43:31.778
Hi.

43:31.862 --> 43:33.155
-Friend of yours?
-Yes.

43:33.780 --> 43:36.033
No. It's a long story.

43:37.284 --> 43:39.995
Aleida Rosales,
one of our junior engineers.

43:40.078 --> 43:41.872
Sergei Orestovich Nikulov.

43:42.956 --> 43:45.501
-Very good.
-I'm a quick study.

43:45.584 --> 43:47.211
Sergei is head of the Soyuz program.

43:47.294 --> 43:48.295
Cool.

43:49.171 --> 43:51.006
What are you doing here at this hour?

43:52.466 --> 43:54.843
The universal docking system.

43:55.969 --> 43:59.932
I figured I needed some inspiration,
so I thought, go to the source.

44:01.391 --> 44:03.519
Is that under your purview?

44:03.602 --> 44:05.979
No, not really.

44:06.063 --> 44:07.940
She's good. Keep her.

44:08.023 --> 44:11.318
Engineers who like to get
their hands dirty are the best.

44:11.401 --> 44:12.945
-Thanks.
-He's drunk.

44:13.028 --> 44:14.071
I am not.

44:16.365 --> 44:18.075
Not much.

44:28.585 --> 44:30.003
Oh, my God.

44:32.756 --> 44:33.757
That's...

44:35.384 --> 44:36.593
beautiful.

44:37.427 --> 44:38.637
It really is.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.597
Identical on both sides.

44:41.473 --> 44:44.059
Each petal has a latch
either side can grab.

44:48.021 --> 44:49.022
But it won't work.

44:52.317 --> 44:53.443
What?

44:54.820 --> 44:56.530
It's all petals and latches.

44:56.613 --> 44:59.199
There's nothing to disperse
the energy of contact.

44:59.283 --> 45:02.911
If you hit hard,
you could rupture the hull.

45:02.995 --> 45:05.747
Of course. We need a shock absorber.

45:05.831 --> 45:09.084
A ring. Right there.

45:10.544 --> 45:11.879
Okay.

45:12.629 --> 45:13.630
Let us begin.

45:14.548 --> 45:16.091
I guess we're doing this tonight?

45:16.175 --> 45:18.343
Didn't look like you had anywhere to be.

45:27.144 --> 45:32.024
A completely androgynous docking system.

45:32.107 --> 45:35.152
No active probes, no passive cones,

45:35.235 --> 45:37.196
no male or female components.

45:39.448 --> 45:43.035
Three petals, on both sides,

45:43.118 --> 45:48.290
simultaneously latching
with identical actions.

45:57.424 --> 45:59.635
Very clever. This will work for us.

46:04.681 --> 46:08.018
Now, leading up to the approach,

46:08.101 --> 46:13.148
the two crafts will need to coordinate
their approach, so...

46:15.901 --> 46:20.614
Soyuz frequencies are 121.75

46:20.697 --> 46:23.575
and 130.167 megahertz.

46:24.117 --> 46:26.912
296.8 and 259.7.

46:35.712 --> 46:37.673
Guess the cat's out of the bag now.

46:39.132 --> 46:41.134
I guess so.

46:41.718 --> 46:44.012
Lunar night's just around the corner.

46:44.096 --> 46:46.139
I don't think Charles is gonna be ready.

46:46.223 --> 46:48.851
LSAM's a bitch to fly
until you get the hang of it.

46:49.726 --> 46:51.353
I like those guys though.

46:52.479 --> 46:53.897
Yeah, they're funny.

46:54.565 --> 46:55.899
I like their attitude.

46:56.900 --> 46:59.611
First to fight, semper fi, oorah.

47:01.947 --> 47:03.699
My brother was like that.

47:06.159 --> 47:08.662
It's one of the things I love about Gordo.

47:10.956 --> 47:13.876
He was one cocky piece of hot shit
once upon a time,

47:13.959 --> 47:15.460
but you know that.

47:16.962 --> 47:18.297
Maybe I was too.

47:20.841 --> 47:24.428
Guess people change. Except for you.

47:25.095 --> 47:28.265
You're all perfectly preserved down there.

47:31.310 --> 47:36.481
Never gonna... turn into some
scary old skeleton with a bad haircut.

47:36.565 --> 47:39.860
And you did have a bad haircut.
I hate to break it to you.

47:42.654 --> 47:47.534
Nah, you're gonna remain
just as you are now.

47:49.745 --> 47:52.873
Permanent. Unchanging.

47:58.128 --> 47:59.630
Something that lasts.

48:02.591 --> 48:04.885
Yeah, nothing lasts on Earth.

48:06.303 --> 48:07.804
It's always changing.

48:12.976 --> 48:15.479
Mr. Cleveland will see you right away.

48:15.562 --> 48:16.647
Thank you.

48:54.518 --> 48:57.145
-Hey, you got a library card?
-I left it at home.

48:57.813 --> 48:59.857
You're gonna
have to leave a deposit at the desk

48:59.940 --> 49:01.650
if you wanna check anything out.

49:02.234 --> 49:04.486
-How you doing, Gordo?
-Just fine, Sam. How are you?

49:04.570 --> 49:05.571
Couldn't be better.

49:07.114 --> 49:08.657
-Plutarch.
-Yeah.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.868
Yeah, I read it when I was a kid.
Loved it.

49:11.994 --> 49:15.289
Who the hell reads Plutarch as a kid
and loves it?

49:15.372 --> 49:16.373
I did.

49:17.708 --> 49:20.502
Heroic tales of brave men long past.

49:21.503 --> 49:22.671
Just like you.

49:23.255 --> 49:25.424
Hey, I hear you're going back to the moon.

49:25.507 --> 49:26.508
Wine?

49:27.009 --> 49:28.635
Yeah, sure.

49:28.719 --> 49:31.722
Yeah. Heading up in a few weeks.

49:31.805 --> 49:34.892
Good for you. Glad to see you
getting back in that saddle.

49:36.435 --> 49:38.395
That's why I wanted to talk to you, Sam.

49:39.563 --> 49:42.191
About me going back to the moon.

49:42.816 --> 49:47.029
Thomas Jefferson himself
owned this very bottle.

49:47.112 --> 49:48.822
You don't wanna...

49:48.906 --> 49:50.949
Yeah, course I do.

49:51.033 --> 49:53.327
What's it for
unless you're gonna drink it?

49:53.410 --> 49:55.954
I don't even wanna tell you
what that bottle cost.

49:56.038 --> 49:59.541
But I will tell ya
what that glass is worth.

50:02.211 --> 50:04.087
That's about $1,500.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.966
Exactly. So drink it slow.

50:08.550 --> 50:10.219
You know what?
I can't even watch you do it.

50:10.302 --> 50:12.513
It's like I'm pouring money
down your throat. Okay?

50:19.061 --> 50:20.229
Am I right?

50:20.312 --> 50:22.356
Tommy Jefferson's loss is our gain.

50:22.439 --> 50:23.899
I know.

50:23.982 --> 50:27.069
Here, have a seat.
Tell me what's on your mind, Gordo.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.703
I'm getting Tracy back.

50:40.958 --> 50:42.084
Is that right?

50:43.168 --> 50:44.628
That's right.

50:44.711 --> 50:48.715
So I thought I'd come here and
tell you face-to-face my intentions.

50:49.424 --> 50:51.051
I'm going to the moon.

50:52.302 --> 50:54.221
And I'm gonna get my wife back.

51:00.519 --> 51:02.062
You're serious.

51:08.360 --> 51:13.782
I don't mean to stand on ceremony,
but she's actually my wife now.

51:13.866 --> 51:15.158
For the moment.

51:15.242 --> 51:18.287
I figured that I owed you
the courtesy of a heads-up.

51:21.498 --> 51:24.168
You got some balls there, Gordo Stevens.
I'll give you that.

51:26.795 --> 51:29.798
Listen, I guess I could reach over
there and punch you in the nose right now.

51:31.133 --> 51:32.885
Or...

51:32.968 --> 51:35.304
Or maybe I'll let you go ahead and try.

51:35.888 --> 51:38.056
'Cause I don't think
she's going anywhere, Gordo.

51:39.099 --> 51:40.559
I really don't.

51:42.144 --> 51:44.062
-That a fact?
-That is a fact.

51:48.901 --> 51:50.402
She's made her choice.

51:51.945 --> 51:56.909
And when Tracy makes up her mind,
neither man nor beast can change it.

52:03.790 --> 52:05.209
She's a wild horse, Gordo.

52:06.210 --> 52:07.461
She can't be caught.

52:09.546 --> 52:11.715
Tracy goes exactly where she wants to go,

52:11.798 --> 52:14.843
and she does exactly what she wants to do.

52:16.637 --> 52:18.222
One of the things I love about her.

52:20.140 --> 52:24.019
So you can go all the way there, and you
can try your very best to win her back.

52:25.062 --> 52:26.688
But you know what the truth is.

52:27.272 --> 52:28.857
She ain't mine, she ain't yours.

52:29.983 --> 52:31.193
She's hers.

52:33.612 --> 52:37.199
And if she picks you,
nothing on earth I can do about it.

52:37.866 --> 52:39.368
But if she picks me...

52:41.036 --> 52:43.038
nothing up on that moon
you can do about it.

52:59.054 --> 53:00.848
It was good talking to you, Sam.

53:04.059 --> 53:05.561
Yeah, well, see you around, Gordo.

53:21.451 --> 53:23.579
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

53:23.662 --> 53:24.788
You met someone.

53:26.248 --> 53:27.457
How did you...

53:27.541 --> 53:31.712
Come on, El. You're practically glowing.

53:32.254 --> 53:33.797
Give me the details.

53:33.881 --> 53:36.300
Where'd you guys meet? What's her name?

53:38.385 --> 53:39.720
Her name is Pam.

53:41.680 --> 53:44.266
Pam Horton? Seriously?

53:46.018 --> 53:47.227
How'd that happen?

53:48.729 --> 53:50.105
She sent me her book.

53:50.898 --> 53:53.609
-She's a writer now?
-Yeah, a poet.

53:54.401 --> 53:55.694
Of course she is.

53:56.737 --> 53:58.030
What's that supposed to mean?

53:58.113 --> 54:00.032
No, it's just, I'm...

54:02.075 --> 54:03.285
Holy cow.

54:06.705 --> 54:07.789
Well, good.

54:08.916 --> 54:11.668
Good for you. You look happy.

54:12.503 --> 54:13.504
I am.

54:17.090 --> 54:18.300
That's all that matters.

54:20.761 --> 54:21.762
Larry--

54:21.845 --> 54:25.766
Just surprised that she's
up for the whole... you know.

54:25.849 --> 54:30.729
Last time she was pretty adamant that you
had to come out or she wasn't going to...

54:42.783 --> 54:43.784
Yeah.

54:45.327 --> 54:46.328
Wow.

54:50.290 --> 54:51.500
Okay.

54:55.379 --> 54:56.588
It's...

54:57.256 --> 54:58.549
It's time.

55:00.217 --> 55:01.260
It's time?

55:01.343 --> 55:05.681
I didn't know that there was a time.
What are you saying?

55:06.473 --> 55:09.017
I'm saying that we should start--

55:09.893 --> 55:12.271
we should start living our real lives.

55:13.772 --> 55:16.817
Maybe think about getting a divorce.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.777
A divorce?

55:18.861 --> 55:21.822
You walk in here and you just announce
that we're getting a divorce?

55:21.905 --> 55:23.407
Larry, we're not really married.

55:23.490 --> 55:25.200
What, because we don't sleep together?

55:25.284 --> 55:26.952
Well, for one thing, yeah.

55:27.035 --> 55:29.788
-So that's your definition of marriage?
-No, Lar--

55:29.872 --> 55:31.707
I love you, Ellen.

55:31.790 --> 55:37.337
I do. And I thought that
we were sharing a life... together.

55:38.130 --> 55:40.048
We have plans.

55:41.091 --> 55:42.593
Now that's just over?

55:42.676 --> 55:47.598
I know. But this wasn't meant
to last forever. You know that.

55:47.681 --> 55:50.934
Mars, the asteroid belt,
the moons of Jupiter.

55:51.018 --> 55:53.145
The future is there for the taking.

55:53.228 --> 55:56.231
And you and I are
the perfect people to seize it.

55:56.315 --> 55:57.774
I'm alone, Larry.

55:59.484 --> 56:01.320
Really alone.

56:01.403 --> 56:02.905
You have Peter.

56:02.988 --> 56:06.658
And before that there was John.
And before that there was...

56:07.201 --> 56:09.036
-David.
-David. But I'm not you.

56:09.119 --> 56:12.998
I go to sleep alone every night,
and I wake up alone every day.

56:13.081 --> 56:17.503
And it's not like I haven't tried looking
over the years, I have,

56:17.586 --> 56:19.546
but there's been no one since her.

56:20.672 --> 56:21.673
I love you, Larry.

56:21.757 --> 56:26.345
I do. I love the life
we've built here together. It's amazing.

56:26.428 --> 56:28.222
I don't want to lose you.

56:28.305 --> 56:32.601
But I love her... in a different way.

56:33.185 --> 56:36.271
Like... Like my...

56:36.355 --> 56:41.276
Like my heart stopped for ten years
and then suddenly started beating again.

56:52.913 --> 56:54.623
Okay. Okay.

56:54.706 --> 56:56.124
Really?

56:56.750 --> 56:57.876
For my wife, anything.

56:58.460 --> 56:59.837
Thank you!

57:01.964 --> 57:04.049
We don't have to do anything right away.

57:04.132 --> 57:06.844
You mean you're not coming out
before you go to the airport?

57:07.845 --> 57:09.179
No.

57:12.599 --> 57:13.892
I'm gonna miss my flight.

57:19.773 --> 57:22.734
We'll talk when I'm back.

57:22.818 --> 57:23.902
Yeah.

57:25.821 --> 57:26.822
Safe travels.

57:42.713 --> 57:44.339
Where's our brass band?
