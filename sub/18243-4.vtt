I didn't see tacos
on the menu.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.297
Oh. Just the lemonade.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.692
No problem.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.868
Thank you, uh,
Eleanor.

11:37.566 --> 11:38.698
Do you think
anyone will notice

11:38.785 --> 11:41.222
if we eat the tacos here?

11:41.309 --> 11:42.658
I think we're safe.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.231
Okay, take us to after
the Pluot Festival.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.190
The 1965 Pluot Festival.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.410
Just being safe.

12:00.676 --> 12:03.113
One, two, three.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.029
♪ Hang on, Sloopy ♪

12:06.116 --> 12:07.291
♪ Sloopy, hang on ♪

12:07.378 --> 12:08.728
What is everyone
wearing?

12:08.815 --> 12:10.686
Hannah:
I kind of like it.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.688
Can you believe this place
was this packed?

12:15.386 --> 12:17.693
Seventy-five cents
for a hamburger?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.869
At that price,
I would eat 10 a day.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.958
Hey! Eleanor.
We've been waiting
an hour

12:22.045 --> 12:23.612
for our milkshakes.

12:23.699 --> 12:26.136
Don't blow your top.
I'm new here.

12:26.223 --> 12:29.313
Is that the same Eleanor
who brought us our lemonade?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.012
This day
just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

12:35.972 --> 12:36.886
Over here.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.674
You didn't get
my morbium seed?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.893
What do you want from me?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.416
He disappeared
into thin air.

12:45.503 --> 12:46.722
What if he
never comes back?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.071
We're only in
this situation

12:48.158 --> 12:50.334
because you told him
about the magic.

12:50.421 --> 12:51.988
He gone with
my morbium seed,

12:52.075 --> 12:53.860
and now I'm
the only one without one.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.645
Unless Becky used hers
to spike the apple.

12:56.732 --> 12:57.689
What?

12:57.777 --> 12:58.821
Only something
that powerful

12:58.908 --> 13:00.170
could have made
Chuck disappear.

13:00.257 --> 13:03.130
And you were
the last person
to see him.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.479
I didn't do it.

13:04.566 --> 13:05.523
Prove it.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.224
I recognize that locket.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.446
Are you satisfied now?

13:17.361 --> 13:18.493
It doesn't get
my seed back.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.277
Is that really
all you care about?

13:20.364 --> 13:22.149
What about Chuck?

13:22.236 --> 13:24.107
This wasn't the plan.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.326
What have we done?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.730
One, two, three.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.997
I guess that solves
the morbium mystery.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.521
Yeah, your grandma
didn't spike the apple.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.523
But she lied to me.

13:48.610 --> 13:49.959
She said that Chuck
stole her seed,

13:50.046 --> 13:51.918
but how could he
have stolen it

13:52.005 --> 13:54.355
if she still had it
after he disappeared?

13:54.442 --> 13:56.836
Why would
Grandma Becky lie?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.794
I don't know.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.404
I have to get home.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.929
Yeah, me, too.
Guitar lessons.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.192
Me, three.
I'm hoping for
some good news.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.639
I see your chickens
have come home to roost.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.816
Don't waste my time
with your folksy nonsense.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.819
Tell me what you cooked
to keep me out of my pantry.

14:23.906 --> 14:27.344
Or you'll what,
stare at me funny?

14:27.431 --> 14:28.955
I should have known
you helped the girls

14:29.042 --> 14:30.347
lock me out of
my pantry.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.914
Forget the pantry.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.090
We need to
talk about Chuck.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.614
The same tune
for 50 years.

14:36.701 --> 14:37.920
Not me.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.879
There's a whole
big world out there,

14:39.966 --> 14:42.011
and I'm done
dwelling on the past.

14:42.098 --> 14:45.667
Oh, settle down.
You were in Paris
for five minutes.

14:45.754 --> 14:48.583
Chuck's coming after
my family.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.193
We need to keep him away
from the girls,

14:50.280 --> 14:52.239
and away from magic,

14:52.326 --> 14:54.676
even if it means
we have to cook.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.983
It didn't turn out so well
the last time we cooked

14:57.070 --> 14:58.810
to solve
the Chuck problem.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.769
I don't care what happens
to Chuck.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.814
But if you find
my morbium seed,

15:02.902 --> 15:04.599
don't forget
who it belongs to.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.645
Look, like it or not,
we started this.

15:07.732 --> 15:10.431
And we have to be
on the same page
about how to fix it.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.433
Oh, some things
never change.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.870
You're both just
as selfish as ever.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.394
You with your
morbium seed,

15:17.481 --> 15:20.484
and you trying to play
the noble protector card.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.530
Am I the only one
who feels bad

15:22.617 --> 15:23.618
for what we did to Chuck?

15:29.145 --> 15:30.451
Mom, Dad!

15:30.538 --> 15:32.453
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what happened?

15:32.540 --> 15:33.976
It's nothin' serious.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.717
Buddy's okay.
He just scraped
his arm.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.153
- Does it hurt?
- Buddy.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.546
Honey,
what happened?

15:38.633 --> 15:40.591
Chuck saved my life.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.202
He pushed me
out of the way.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.551
It wasn't
that big of a deal.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.944
And it's not
Buddy's fault.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.336
He was just playing
on his skateboard

15:46.423 --> 15:47.729
when a car came
speeding down the road.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.078
He didn't even see
the little guy,

15:49.165 --> 15:51.863
but I grabbed him at
the last second.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.561
Only wish I could have
gotten the license plate.

15:53.648 --> 15:54.954
Wow, we're lucky
you were there.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.999
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, thank you.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.523
But, um, who are you?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.482
Oh, my apologies,
Mrs. Quinn.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.440
My name's Chuck.
I'm Miss Silver's nephew

16:03.527 --> 16:04.441
from Lavender Heights.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.356
He's really cool.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.010
Oh, okay.
[chuckles]

16:08.097 --> 16:09.925
I didn't even know
she had a nephew.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.144
Well, thanks again.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.711
Okay, honey,
let's go clean you up.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.105
[exhales]
Thanks again for
bringing him back.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.715
We owe you big time.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.543
Just glad I was there.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.937
Is that a brand new
turntable?

16:22.024 --> 16:23.983
Uh, it's actually
really old.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.767
Forgot I had it
in the attic.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.683
Huh. I got one myself.
It's a beater, but it runs.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.815
I was on my way
to El Pete's
when I saw Buddy.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.166
Whoa. You're into
old vinyl?

16:33.253 --> 16:34.994
Is there any other way
to listen to music?

16:35.081 --> 16:36.386
[chuckles] There are
a lot of other ways,

16:36.473 --> 16:38.345
but none as good
in my mind.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.476
I hate to
break it to you,

16:39.563 --> 16:41.261
but El Pete's
is closed today.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.046
Oh, well,
I guess I'll have to
try again tomorrow.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.395
You know what?
Why don't I give you

16:45.482 --> 16:46.918
a record or two
from my collection.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.269
Most of 'em are
collecting dust anyway.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.662
That would be cool.
Thanks, Mr. Quinn.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.142
Yeah, of course.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.796
Least I can do
since you were there
for Buddy.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.415
"Darbs, you forgot
your retainer.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.374
"Again.
Love, Dad."

17:08.853 --> 17:09.984
Dad was here.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.992
Take me to the last time
Dad was here.

17:17.906 --> 17:18.906
[knocking]

17:21.561 --> 17:22.519
Guess who left this
in my car.

17:22.606 --> 17:23.825
Shocker.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.522
Jokes on you.
Did it on purpose.

17:26.609 --> 17:27.785
You got a second?

17:27.872 --> 17:29.613
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.006
I think I know what
you're gonna say.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.225
So do I.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.053
I think we've done
a great job of

17:34.140 --> 17:36.011
keeping things normal
for Darbie.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.882
Maybe too good
of a job.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.841
She's getting
the wrong idea,
isn't she?

17:39.928 --> 17:41.060
Wait, what?

17:41.147 --> 17:42.322
- You noticed, too.
- Yeah.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.975
Last night
she kept asking

17:44.063 --> 17:46.108
when we're going on
our next family vacation.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.588
I think we need to
talk to her.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.024
She's needs to know
this is permanent.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.286
Permanent?

17:50.373 --> 17:52.723
She also needs to know
about Amy.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.030
Amy? Cubicle buddy Amy?

17:55.117 --> 17:57.119
Saffron Falls is
a small town.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.078
Sooner or later,
she's gonna find out.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.297
I know, Jenny.
It just feels too soon.

18:01.384 --> 18:05.040
She clearly hasn't
accepted the divorce.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.260
Can't believe this.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.186
So, you in Saffron Falls
for the summer?

18:20.273 --> 18:22.144
Maybe longer.
It all depends.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.712
Bet your parents
will miss you
being away that long.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.627
They're no longer
with us.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.063
Oh, Chuck,
I'm so sorry.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.370
Ah, it was
a long time ago.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.545
I've been
living with my sister,

18:31.632 --> 18:33.068
but things weren't
working out,

18:33.155 --> 18:36.767
so I decided to
give it a shot
with my Aunt Gina.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.595
Well, I'm sure
you'll like Saffron Falls.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.857
I already do.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.338
[chuckles]
It's all here.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.905
Bowie, Dylan, Beatles.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.037
You name it,
I purchased it
at a garage sale

18:46.125 --> 18:47.691
or El Pete's.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.519
Hey, what are your thoughts
on the Rolling Stones?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.956
Love 'em.
They're the best.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.219
Right?

18:53.306 --> 18:55.264
It's pretty rad up here,
Mr. Quinn.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.788
That's what
I've been sayin'.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.355
Uh, do you have
any Beach Boys?

18:59.442 --> 19:01.705
Uh, I do,
somewhere around here.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.751
[grunts]
It might take
a little digging.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.231
I've been trying to
get Kelly into them,

19:05.318 --> 19:07.494
but she says they sound
too old fashioned.

19:07.581 --> 19:10.105
- That's a shame.
- [muttering] Beach Boys,
Beach Boys.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.499
[sighs]
I keep meaning to come up
and put a system in place.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.501
Uh, what kind of system?

19:14.588 --> 19:16.764
I'd like to go by
decade and genre,

19:16.851 --> 19:19.158
but Terry says
I should do alphabetical.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.812
And you know what?
I'm beginning to
agree with her.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.208
Hey, I gotta
run downstairs.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.818
I'll be back
in a minute.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.386
Take your time.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.084
[birds chirping]

19:33.172 --> 19:35.261
[piano playing]

19:40.744 --> 19:41.702
[sighs]

19:47.751 --> 19:50.058
Take me back to the day
Gina showed Chuck the book.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.499
Gina: I shouldn't have
told you about the book.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.023
If we're gonna be friends,
we can't keep secrets.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.634
[sighs] Okay,

20:00.721 --> 20:02.723
but promise you won't
tell anybody.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.899
Of course.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.379
You can trust me,
Gina.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.878
Here it is.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.403
Just looks like
a regular old cookbook to me.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.708
That's what it looks like
on the outside,

20:31.795 --> 20:33.928
but inside--

20:35.973 --> 20:37.975
The recipes are magic.

20:39.586 --> 20:40.804
[phone rings]

20:40.891 --> 20:42.241
I better get that.
I'll be right back.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.680
[ringing continues]

20:50.727 --> 20:51.859
- [electricity crackling]
- [gasping]

20:56.342 --> 20:58.648
You didn't think
it would be that easy,
did you?

20:59.693 --> 21:00.781
What's she doing here?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.872
You thought
I wouldn't find it.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.613
You're no match
for them.

21:08.528 --> 21:09.877
Are you sure about that?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.754
You must not trust him.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.280
He remembers.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.111
[piano playing]

21:27.198 --> 21:28.809
Chuck knows the traveler?

21:40.211 --> 21:41.778
What are you doing here?

21:41.865 --> 21:42.953
Your mom told me to
let myself in

21:43.040 --> 21:44.912
if I got here early.
You ready to go?

21:44.999 --> 21:47.654
Why are you pretending
like everything's normal
when it's not?

21:47.741 --> 21:49.351
What do you mean?

21:49.438 --> 21:52.180
Showing up here,
going to play off games
with Mom and me,

21:52.267 --> 21:54.835
family game night.
It's all a lie.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.925
- Darbie.
- Are you dating the woman
I met in the park?

21:58.012 --> 22:00.275
- Amy?
- [sighs]

22:00.362 --> 22:01.363
Your mom told you
about it.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.756
Doesn't matter
how I found out.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.888
I should have been
the one to tell you

22:04.975 --> 22:07.848
- so I could explain--
- I don't want you to
explain.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.198
I thought you and mom
were getting back together.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.288
Oh, sweetie,
I am so sorry if we
gave you that impression.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.464
I want us to be
a family again.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.558
Darbs, look at me.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.647
We'll always be
a family.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.737
Your mom, you, me,
we'll always be connected,

22:27.824 --> 22:29.652
and that won't change,

22:29.739 --> 22:31.785
no matter who
your mom or I date.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.178
Everything's changed,
don't pretend it hasn't.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.355
Not everything.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.313
Your mom and I love you.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.795
That will never,
ever change.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.406
Okay?

22:44.493 --> 22:45.625
[sobbing] Okay.

23:12.652 --> 23:13.957
There you are.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.785
Kelly, your friend
is a cool guy.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.134
Jake?

23:17.221 --> 23:20.007
Well, yeah, but
I'm talking about Chuck.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.530
Wait, what?

23:21.617 --> 23:23.097
Miss Silvers' nephew.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.664
He's up in the attic
looking at my records.

23:24.751 --> 23:25.665
The attic?

23:30.191 --> 23:32.628
[electricity crackling]

23:32.715 --> 23:34.935
- Get away from there.
- Oh, hey, Kelly, what's up?

23:35.022 --> 23:36.153
What are you doing up here?

23:36.240 --> 23:37.546
Looking at records.

23:37.633 --> 23:40.375
Your dad's around here
somewhere.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.377
Drop the act.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.900
What act?

23:43.987 --> 23:46.250
I think you have
your memories back.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.339
And that means that
you know about the cookbook,

23:48.427 --> 23:51.560
and more importantly,
you know the traveler.

23:54.563 --> 23:57.261
Is that what she's
calling herself these days?

23:57.348 --> 23:58.915
The traveler?

24:00.613 --> 24:04.051
You're smarter than
they ever were.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.009
Nice hiding place.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.403
Stay away from my family,

24:08.490 --> 24:10.666
you stay away from
the cookbook.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.156
Enjoy it while you have it.
