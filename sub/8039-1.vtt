00:47.127 --> 00:50.096
All right, sweet pea,
it's time for you to go to bed.

00:50.263 --> 00:53.596
Mommy, would you ask Daddy
to come tuck me in?

00:53.767 --> 00:56.099
No, he's at work tonight
at the fire station.

00:56.269 --> 00:58.294
But he'll be home tomorrow night.

00:58.472 --> 01:01.202
Mommy, I want to marry Daddy.

01:01.375 --> 01:04.435
You do?
Catherine, you can't marry Daddy.

01:04.611 --> 01:06.101
He's my husband.

01:06.279 --> 01:08.713
Well, when you're done being married,
can I have him?

01:10.083 --> 01:13.575
We'll never be done.
You'll have to marry somebody else.

01:13.754 --> 01:16.416
Can I wear a white dress
and white gloves?

01:16.590 --> 01:18.285
Sure, if you want to.

01:18.458 --> 01:22.121
Will we live happily after ever?

01:22.629 --> 01:25.860
If you marry somebody
who really, really loves you.

01:26.032 --> 01:27.659
Like Daddy?

01:27.834 --> 01:30.428
Yes, like Daddy.

02:34.301 --> 02:36.769
- Terrell, man, my bad out there.
- This ain't no game.

02:36.937 --> 02:38.802
You playing with people lives.

02:39.473 --> 02:40.633
Come on, man.

02:43.610 --> 02:45.237
Eric, he's got a right to be upset.

02:45.412 --> 02:48.040
You left him in a dangerous spot
and tried to be a hero.

02:48.215 --> 02:50.183
I thought I heard someone
calling for help.

02:50.350 --> 02:53.114
It was coming
from outside the building.

02:53.286 --> 02:54.617
It was dark, I couldn't see.

02:54.788 --> 02:58.053
That's why you stay with your partner.
He had to assume...

02:58.225 --> 03:01.558
...that something happened to you
and you needed his help.

03:02.162 --> 03:05.495
You never leave your partner,
especially in a fire.

03:07.634 --> 03:10.102
You give him some time
and then give him an apology.

03:10.270 --> 03:12.898
- And make it sincere.
- Yes, sir.

03:22.649 --> 03:24.674
- Hey, Tasha.
- Oh, hey, Cat.

03:24.851 --> 03:26.546
Just saw you on TV. Looking good.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.484
Oh, I missed it. I was giving a tour
of the new cancer wing.

03:29.656 --> 03:31.624
- Hey, has Robin left yet?
- No, she's here.

03:31.791 --> 03:33.383
Robin, Cat's here.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.891
- Hey.
- How are you?

03:35.061 --> 03:36.221
I'm good. How are you?

03:36.396 --> 03:38.227
Good.
Hey, are we still on for tomorrow?

03:38.398 --> 03:41.094
Yeah, 4:00. You still want
those scented candles, right?

03:41.268 --> 03:42.667
Oh, absolutely. Bring them on.

03:42.836 --> 03:44.133
- I wanna try them all.
- Good.

03:44.304 --> 03:46.169
I'm going to see my parents
this weekend.

03:46.339 --> 03:49.172
- I thought they might like some too.
- Oh, how are they?

03:49.342 --> 03:52.277
Do you know it's been a year
since Mom's stroke?

03:52.445 --> 03:54.970
I've been trying to get her
a new bed and wheelchair...

03:55.148 --> 03:57.844
...but their insurance
doesn't cover it.

03:58.018 --> 04:00.350
I don't know.
It's so frustrating for my dad.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.318
He wants to help her too,
but he can't afford it either.

04:03.490 --> 04:05.549
- I am so sorry.
- Yeah, it's all right.

04:06.159 --> 04:07.456
Anyway, well, I need to run.

04:07.627 --> 04:09.891
- But I'll see you tomorrow, right?
- I'll see you.

04:10.063 --> 04:11.894
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

04:12.399 --> 04:14.924
- Hey, Catherine.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Keller.

04:15.101 --> 04:16.796
Call me Gavin, please.

04:16.970 --> 04:19.461
Gavin, sorry for almost
running you over.

04:19.639 --> 04:22.608
- Anytime. It's good to see you.
- You too. Take care.

04:26.146 --> 04:27.773
Sweet girl.

04:28.348 --> 04:31.875
- Tasha, will you file this for me?
- Sure, doctor.

04:35.121 --> 04:39.820
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say the doctor has a thing for Cat.

04:52.238 --> 04:53.933
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.

04:54.107 --> 04:56.405
- How are you?
- Oh, great. Good to see you.

04:56.576 --> 04:57.770
You too.

04:57.944 --> 05:02.005
Hey, Mama. How are you, huh?

05:02.182 --> 05:03.911
She's doing great today.

05:04.084 --> 05:05.847
Can I get you
something to drink, dear?

05:06.286 --> 05:09.255
- Do you have any sweet tea?
- With lemon?

05:09.422 --> 05:11.253
You know me.

05:14.661 --> 05:17.425
Oh, Mama, I wish we could talk.

05:18.698 --> 05:21.792
It's been so long
since I heard your voice.

05:25.572 --> 05:27.335
I miss you.

05:53.733 --> 05:56.497
- You have breakfast already?
- Yes.

05:57.771 --> 06:01.366
- What'd you eat?
- I had the last bagel and a yogurt.

06:08.848 --> 06:11.180
Are you planning
on making a grocery trip soon?

06:11.584 --> 06:13.984
Caleb, you work 24 hours
and then you're off for 48.

06:14.154 --> 06:17.214
- You've got more time to go than I do.
- I asked a simple question.

06:17.390 --> 06:20.587
You don't need to get smart with me.
At least save me some breakfast.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.729
I never know when you're coming
or going. You don't tell me.

06:23.897 --> 06:25.592
Catherine, what is your problem?

06:25.765 --> 06:27.858
Did I offend you
by walking in the door?

06:28.034 --> 06:31.197
You can't expect me to work every day
and get the groceries...

06:31.371 --> 06:34.932
...while you look at trash on the
Internet dreaming about your boat.

06:35.108 --> 06:36.769
You chose to take this job.

06:36.943 --> 06:39.707
- No one said you had to work full-time.
- We need the income.

06:39.879 --> 06:42.439
Especially since you tuck away
a third of your salary...

06:42.615 --> 06:44.242
...saving for a boat we don't need.

06:44.417 --> 06:48.285
You've got $24,000 in savings
when things in our house need fixing.

06:48.455 --> 06:49.922
Like what?

06:50.090 --> 06:52.957
The back door needs to be painted,
the yard needs landscaping.

06:53.126 --> 06:55.321
And I wanna put more shelves
in the closet.

06:55.495 --> 06:58.191
Those are called preferences.
Those are not needs.

06:58.364 --> 07:01.731
There's a difference. If you wanna
spend your money on that stuff, fine.

07:01.901 --> 07:05.166
I've been saving for my boat for years.
You're not taking that from me.

07:05.338 --> 07:07.636
This is so pointless.
I don't have time for this.

07:07.807 --> 07:10.071
Yeah, shut the door
on your way out.

07:44.778 --> 07:46.712
It ain't working, Michael.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.807
How is it that I get respect
everywhere I go...

07:49.983 --> 07:51.848
...except in my own house?

07:52.485 --> 07:55.579
I've been there,
and it's a hard place to be.

07:56.923 --> 07:58.720
What'd you do about it?

07:59.726 --> 08:02.194
I realized that it wasn't my marriage
that was broken.

08:02.362 --> 08:04.455
I just didn't know
how to make it work.

08:05.665 --> 08:07.326
What does that mean?

08:09.502 --> 08:10.935
That treadmill's not broken.

08:11.104 --> 08:14.198
But if you don't know how to run it,
it ain't gonna work for you.

08:15.441 --> 08:17.102
You saying I need counseling?

08:17.277 --> 08:19.211
Well, I think everybody
needs counseling.

08:19.746 --> 08:23.307
Hey, look, man, I am not about to go
talk to somebody I don't even know...

08:23.483 --> 08:25.747
...about something
that's none of their business.

08:25.919 --> 08:28.911
All right.
Catherine does need to respect you.

08:29.088 --> 08:30.953
But just remember,
a woman's like a rose.

08:31.124 --> 08:33.854
If you treat her right, she'll bloom.

08:34.027 --> 08:36.120
If you don't, she'll wilt.

08:38.464 --> 08:39.726
Where'd you get that?

08:40.433 --> 08:41.900
Counseling.

09:00.453 --> 09:02.182
Great.

09:02.355 --> 09:04.084
What are you doing?

09:04.624 --> 09:06.751
I see you left me no pizza.

09:06.926 --> 09:09.190
I just lit that candle.
I like the way it smells.

09:09.362 --> 09:11.990
Well, I don't.
Did you leave me any dinner at all?

09:12.165 --> 09:14.326
I assumed
you were eating with Michael.

09:14.701 --> 09:15.963
Does it not occur to you...

09:16.135 --> 09:18.399
...that two people in this house
both need to eat?

09:18.571 --> 09:20.869
You know what?
If you would communicate with me...

09:21.040 --> 09:23.270
...maybe I could
have something for you.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.835
Why do you have to make
everything so difficult?

09:27.013 --> 09:28.742
Oh, I'm making everything difficult?

09:28.915 --> 09:32.351
I'm carrying the weight around here
while you're off doing your own thing.

09:32.518 --> 09:33.610
Excuse me?

09:33.786 --> 09:37.119
I'm working to pay this mortgage,
and I pay for both of the cars.

09:37.290 --> 09:40.350
Yeah, and that's all you do.
I pay all of our bills with my salary.

09:40.526 --> 09:42.517
Which you agreed to do. That's fair.

09:42.695 --> 09:45.129
Do you not like this house?
Do you not like your car?

09:45.298 --> 09:47.129
Caleb, who takes care
of this house?

09:47.300 --> 09:48.961
Me. Who washes all the clothes?

09:49.135 --> 09:50.602
Me. Who gets all the groceries?

09:50.770 --> 09:54.035
Me. Not to mention I'm helping
my parents every weekend.

09:54.207 --> 09:55.731
I've got all this pressure on me.

09:55.909 --> 09:58.173
The only thing you do for anybody
is for yourself.

09:58.344 --> 10:01.438
Let me tell you, you don't know
the first thing about pressure.

10:01.614 --> 10:05.072
All right? You think
I put out house fires for myself?

10:05.251 --> 10:08.118
Or rush to car wrecks at 2 a. m.
For myself?

10:08.288 --> 10:11.815
Or pull a child's body
out of a lake for myself?

10:11.991 --> 10:14.323
You have no idea what I go through.

10:14.494 --> 10:17.190
Yeah, but what do you do around here
other than watch TV...

10:17.363 --> 10:18.955
...and waste time on the Internet?

10:19.132 --> 10:22.033
If looking at that trash
is how you get fulfilled, that's fine.

10:22.201 --> 10:23.668
But I will not compete with it.

10:23.836 --> 10:26.066
Well, I sure don't get it from you.

10:27.140 --> 10:28.232
And you won't.

10:28.408 --> 10:31.104
Because you care more
about saving for your stupid boat...

10:31.277 --> 10:34.303
...and pleasing yourself
than you ever did about me.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.574
Shut up! I'm sick of you!

10:37.750 --> 10:41.083
You disrespectful, ungrateful,
selfish woman!

10:41.254 --> 10:43.119
- I'm not selfish.
- How dare you say that?

10:43.289 --> 10:46.918
You constantly nag me
and you drain the life out of me!

10:47.093 --> 10:49.027
I'm tired of it!

10:49.195 --> 10:51.186
If you can't give me
the respect I deserve...

10:51.364 --> 10:52.695
Look at me!

10:52.865 --> 10:55.333
- Then what's the point
of this marriage?

11:02.809 --> 11:04.606
I want out.

11:05.278 --> 11:07.303
I just want out.

11:08.181 --> 11:11.844
If you want out, that's fine with me!

11:47.553 --> 11:49.043
Mr. Rudolph.

11:50.390 --> 11:51.414
Caleb.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.935
- That's it.
- All right.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.764
Think we got it. We're good to go.

12:38.938 --> 12:40.235
I think I got this.

12:40.406 --> 12:42.670
- You think you know the truck?
- Yeah.

12:42.842 --> 12:45.003
All right. I'll tell you what.

12:45.178 --> 12:47.669
We're gonna go inside
and get something to drink.

12:47.847 --> 12:49.872
You bring me a hose stretcher.

12:50.049 --> 12:51.482
All right.

12:52.552 --> 12:56.010
- That's mean, man.
- No, it's good for him.

12:56.189 --> 12:57.486
- Mother's gifts.
- Okay.

12:57.657 --> 12:59.648
- And...
- You know what? I forgot to tell you.

12:59.826 --> 13:01.953
- I got Friday off and I'll be there.
- Good.

13:02.128 --> 13:03.891
You know I ain't gonna
let my son down.

13:04.063 --> 13:05.087
I know you won't.

13:05.264 --> 13:07.459
Hey, we still got
that hot date tomorrow, right?

13:07.633 --> 13:09.191
Oh, so now it's a hot date?

13:09.368 --> 13:11.199
Life's too short
to have any other kind.

13:11.370 --> 13:12.860
You're right.

13:13.039 --> 13:16.008
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

13:16.175 --> 13:18.302
- And I will see you in the morning.
- All right.

13:18.478 --> 13:21.242
- Back home.
- All right, see you later.

13:25.418 --> 13:27.818
Eric, what are you doing?

13:29.989 --> 13:31.752
Wayne told me
to grab a hose stretcher.

13:31.924 --> 13:34.324
- A hose stretcher?
- Yes, sir.

13:34.927 --> 13:38.260
Eric, you are the hose stretcher.

13:41.701 --> 13:43.259
Man.

13:47.473 --> 13:49.441
Honey, I agree with you.
You gotta get out.

13:49.609 --> 13:51.736
- He don't deserve you.
- You can say that again.

13:51.911 --> 13:56.143
A real man's gotta be a hero to his wife
before anybody, or he ain't a real man.

13:56.315 --> 13:59.876
Do you need a place to stay? I can't
imagine living in the same house.

14:00.052 --> 14:02.350
No, I decided
that I'm not the one that's leaving.

14:02.522 --> 14:05.650
- He's the problem, not me.
- That's right, girl. Stand your ground.

14:05.825 --> 14:07.087
Make him respect you.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.490
If there's one thing
a man understands...

14:09.662 --> 14:13.098
It's respect. That's the issue. That's
the reason our marriage is failing.

14:13.266 --> 14:17.225
She shows me no respect at all.
And the saddest part about it is...

14:17.403 --> 14:19.337
He doesn't have a clue.

14:19.505 --> 14:22.372
He thinks our marriage
has been fine for the most part.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.009
You know, he probably thinks...

14:24.177 --> 14:26.168
Our marriage has been fine
until this year.

14:26.345 --> 14:28.870
Now, all of a sudden,
she goes off the deep end.

14:29.282 --> 14:31.250
Do you think this happened
all of a sudden?

14:31.417 --> 14:33.749
I don't know what to think.
I don't understand her.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.649
She's emotional about everything.

14:35.821 --> 14:38.153
She's easily offended
and way too sensitive.

14:38.324 --> 14:41.816
I mean, he's so insensitive,
you know?

14:41.994 --> 14:45.521
He doesn't truly care how I feel.
He doesn't listen to me.

14:45.698 --> 14:48.895
Even if I say it over
and over and over again.

14:49.068 --> 14:52.162
And then she starts nagging me
and saying I don't listen to her...

14:52.338 --> 14:54.135
...or something like that.

14:54.307 --> 14:56.832
It drives me crazy.
I feel like I'm going...

14:57.009 --> 14:58.533
Insane.

14:58.711 --> 15:01.202
You know,
he doesn't understand my needs.

15:01.380 --> 15:04.076
I feel like we are
completely and totally...

15:04.250 --> 15:05.274
Incompatible.

15:05.451 --> 15:08.716
She's probably whining to her friends,
making me sound like a criminal.

15:08.888 --> 15:12.221
I can see them all right now, crying,
having some sort of group hug.

15:12.391 --> 15:14.825
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
It's gonna be all right.

15:14.994 --> 15:16.484
You'll get through this.

15:16.662 --> 15:17.720
We have your back.

15:17.897 --> 15:19.865
Whatever you need.
Whatever you need.

15:20.266 --> 15:22.461
So you think
it's past the point of no return?

15:23.803 --> 15:26.397
I don't have a reason to return.

15:32.645 --> 15:34.875
- Bethany.
- Hey, Kyle. Hey, Ross.

15:35.047 --> 15:36.878
- What's going on?
- What are y'all doing?

15:37.049 --> 15:39.176
We're heading to the pizza barn
to meet friends.

15:39.352 --> 15:41.149
Y'all wanna come?

15:41.320 --> 15:42.981
Sure.

15:43.522 --> 15:47.458
Hey, we'll race you there.
And if you win, we'll buy.

15:47.627 --> 15:50.255
Ready, set...

15:50.429 --> 15:51.453
Go, go, go.

16:02.608 --> 16:04.098
Hey, Dad.

16:06.846 --> 16:08.677
No, not really.

16:08.848 --> 16:11.373
I think Catherine and I are done.

16:12.952 --> 16:15.011
No, it's over.

16:17.556 --> 16:19.820
She said she wants out.

16:23.496 --> 16:26.260
Sure, yeah, you can come over
tomorrow. I'll be home.

16:28.601 --> 16:30.262
Dad, I gotta go.

16:30.836 --> 16:33.236
Public Safety
to Engine 1, Battalion 1.

16:33.406 --> 16:37.433
Respond to the intersection of
Roosevelt and Kelley, 10-50-I rescue.

16:37.610 --> 16:39.840
<i>- Time out, 12:21.
- Hey, that's close by.</i>

16:40.012 --> 16:43.038
Lieutenant, you and Terrell
take the other truck and go with us.

16:50.856 --> 16:52.551
Okay, let's roll.

17:07.772 --> 17:11.140
Engine 1 is en route
to Roosevelt and Kelley, 10-50 rescue.

17:11.310 --> 17:12.936
<i>10-4, Engine 1.</i>

17:13.112 --> 17:16.548
Lieutenant, you and Sanders have
the Hurst tools ready if we need them.

17:16.982 --> 17:19.712
- You stay with me when we pull up.
- Yes, sir.

17:21.420 --> 17:22.647
We've already got a crowd.

17:22.821 --> 17:25.814
- Can you see it?
- We've got one car on the tracks.

17:25.991 --> 17:27.083
You're kidding me.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.720
Oh, it doesn't look good.

17:29.161 --> 17:30.219
Engine 1, it's 10-23.

17:30.396 --> 17:33.160
We have a two-vehicle accident
with possible entrapment.

17:33.332 --> 17:35.596
One of the vehicles
is on the train tracks.

17:35.768 --> 17:39.101
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.831
<i>Ten-four, Command.
Be advised, EMS is en route.</i>

17:42.007 --> 17:44.276
- Rookie, you come with me.
- Yes, sir. Let's go, guys.

17:46.278 --> 17:48.803
You two go check out the car.
Let me know what you got.

17:48.981 --> 17:51.176
I need
an inch-and-three-quarter line.

17:51.751 --> 17:53.378
Harmon,
you check out the passenger.

17:53.552 --> 17:57.079
All right, I need you all to stay clear
of the tracks and the vehicle.

17:57.256 --> 17:59.156
I'm Captain Holt
from the Fire Department.

17:59.325 --> 18:01.850
- We're here to help.
- Help me, please. I can't get out.

18:02.027 --> 18:04.086
- Where are you hurting?
- My legs are hurting.

18:04.263 --> 18:07.494
- Please, please help me.
- All right, we're gonna help you.

18:09.068 --> 18:10.865
Okay. Where else are you hurting?

18:11.036 --> 18:13.698
My neck is hurting.
Please, please help.

18:13.873 --> 18:16.341
We're gonna get you out of here.
You're gonna be fine.

18:16.509 --> 18:18.773
Please don't leave me.
Please don't let me die.

18:18.944 --> 18:21.139
I promise you
I am not going to leave you.

18:21.313 --> 18:22.974
- You're gonna be all right.
- Captain.

18:23.149 --> 18:25.549
- She's alive but not responding.
- Get the spreaders.

18:25.718 --> 18:28.050
Those two will be okay.
They've got minor injuries.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.552
We have to cut these two out.
Sanders, help Harmon.

18:30.723 --> 18:32.816
- I need you to check for gas leaks.
- Yes, sir.

18:32.992 --> 18:34.391
We've got an ambulance coming.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.528
- I'm gonna stay right here with you.
- Okay.

18:36.695 --> 18:38.322
You're gonna hear
a very loud noise.

18:38.497 --> 18:41.057
That just means
we're getting you out faster.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.667
- All right. You're gonna be all right.
- Okay.

18:45.938 --> 18:48.930
- Captain, did I just hear a train?
- Guys, there's a train coming.

18:49.508 --> 18:51.305
Dispatcher,
this is Roosevelt Command.

18:51.477 --> 18:53.069
We have a car on the train tracks.

18:53.245 --> 18:56.146
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

18:56.849 --> 18:58.316
<i>Roosevelt Command, be advised...</i>

18:58.484 --> 19:01.783
<i>...we are currently unable to make
contact with the train dispatcher.</i>

19:01.954 --> 19:03.478
No, no, no. We don't have time.

19:03.656 --> 19:07.422
Come on, we're gonna have to push it
out of the way. Let's go, let's go.

19:07.593 --> 19:09.458
No, I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

19:09.628 --> 19:12.461
All right, let's go. Push. Push.

19:16.836 --> 19:19.031
Captain, it's not rolling.
We gotta drag it off.

19:19.205 --> 19:21.730
- Get the chain.
- Hey, Wayne, hook up the chain.

19:21.907 --> 19:23.807
Hook up the chain.

19:25.144 --> 19:27.442
Hey, there's a train!

19:27.613 --> 19:30.776
- Captain, we gotta pick this up.
- All right, grab the front.

19:30.950 --> 19:34.681
Lift on three. One, two, three.

19:37.723 --> 19:40.021
Again. One, two, three.

19:43.195 --> 19:46.062
Again. Let's go.
We're getting this car off the tracks.

19:46.465 --> 19:48.399
One, two, three.

19:52.605 --> 19:55.631
Again. One, two, three.

19:57.309 --> 20:00.574
- Again, captain.
- One, two, three.

20:02.815 --> 20:05.079
One, two, three.

20:20.432 --> 20:22.730
Harmon, go back
and get the spreaders.

20:27.039 --> 20:28.063
Medic!

20:29.108 --> 20:31.770
- You all right?
- Come on, let's go.

20:32.177 --> 20:34.611
You'll be okay.
You're gonna be all right.

21:13.752 --> 21:15.447
Thank you, Lord.

21:17.356 --> 21:19.153
Thank you, God.

21:21.493 --> 21:23.427
Thank you, God.

21:26.932 --> 21:28.331
Are you okay?

21:29.935 --> 21:31.903
Captain, I just needed a minute.

21:41.580 --> 21:47.018
Well, I broke my record of how close
I could come to death and still live.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.852
Well, don't break it next time.

21:52.758 --> 21:54.988
I wasn't trying to break it this time.

21:58.464 --> 21:59.863
Hey.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.297
Don't tell my wife.

22:32.498 --> 22:34.966
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah?

22:36.001 --> 22:38.561
This kind of thing doesn't happen
all the time, does it?

22:38.737 --> 22:41.103
Risking our lives? Yes.

22:41.273 --> 22:44.299
Playing chicken with a train?
First time.

22:45.244 --> 22:47.838
- Aren't you afraid of dying?
- No.

22:48.313 --> 22:49.780
Because I know where I'm going.

22:49.948 --> 22:52.746
I just don't wanna get there
because I got hit by a train.

22:55.621 --> 22:57.953
Why don't you come
help me work on some dinner?

22:58.724 --> 23:00.123
All right.

23:02.428 --> 23:05.329
Hey, captain, hold on for a second.

23:05.964 --> 23:07.898
You know where you're going?

23:08.467 --> 23:11.334
- I'm going to my office.
- No.

23:11.970 --> 23:14.063
You believe in heaven and hell?

23:17.009 --> 23:18.340
I don't know.

23:18.510 --> 23:22.241
When I die, I'm going in the ground.
That's where I'm staying.

23:22.414 --> 23:25.872
You know, you and Michael both seem
so sure, but one of you is wrong.

23:26.051 --> 23:27.882
It ain't me.

23:28.053 --> 23:29.680
How do you know?

23:30.589 --> 23:32.784
Hey, listen,
you might not agree with Michael...

23:32.958 --> 23:35.449
...but you and I both know
he's the real deal.

23:40.532 --> 23:42.898
Son, how long has this
been going on?

23:43.068 --> 23:45.730
I don't know, Dad. We've had
our arguments now and then...

23:45.904 --> 23:48.930
...but it seems like now
she is constantly frustrated with me.

23:49.108 --> 23:51.804
I mean, I walk in the door
and she's mad about something.

23:51.977 --> 23:53.706
Have you given her
reason to be upset?

23:53.879 --> 23:55.972
I've never known Catherine
to be unreasonable.

23:56.148 --> 23:58.776
I could have saved the lives
of two people at work...

23:58.951 --> 24:02.216
...and if I'm not here helping wash
the dishes, I'm a horrible husband.

24:02.387 --> 24:04.514
But, Caleb,
she needs your help here as well.

24:04.690 --> 24:06.920
Doesn't she help her parents out
every week?

24:07.092 --> 24:10.653
- She can't do everything around here.
- You sound like you're taking her side.

24:10.829 --> 24:12.626
But she's working and she's trying...

24:12.798 --> 24:15.596
Mom, I do not need you to tell me
I'm doing everything wrong.

24:15.768 --> 24:18.737
I've got Catherine for that.
I am not the problem, she is.

24:18.904 --> 24:22.533
- All I'm saying is, if she's working...
- Cheryl, let's hear Caleb out.

24:22.708 --> 24:24.676
I wanna know
what's going on with him.

24:24.843 --> 24:30.247
Dad, can I please have a few minutes
to talk with you, alone?

24:30.415 --> 24:32.849
Caleb, I just wanna help
you and Catherine.

24:33.018 --> 24:34.952
- Dad.
- Honey.

24:35.788 --> 24:39.019
Why don't you let us take a walk?
It's all right.

24:39.191 --> 24:40.522
Okay.

24:45.497 --> 24:48.466
Dad, why did you have to bring her?

24:48.634 --> 24:51.296
Caleb, because she's my wife.

24:51.470 --> 24:55.133
And your mother,
no one loves you more than her.

24:55.307 --> 24:57.741
She just... She's always fixing me.

24:57.910 --> 25:01.004
She's still trying to fix me.
I'm not broken.

25:01.180 --> 25:05.640
Son, if you're looking
for a perfect mother...

25:06.118 --> 25:08.109
...I'm afraid
there's not one out there.

25:08.287 --> 25:09.845
But she's a good woman.

25:10.022 --> 25:12.013
And I love her now
more than I ever have.

25:12.191 --> 25:15.558
I'm not saying I don't love her, Dad.
Just that she...

25:15.727 --> 25:17.058
She grates on me.

25:18.130 --> 25:21.361
Have you not seen a change in her
in the last two years?

25:21.867 --> 25:24.165
Yeah, she treats you better.

25:24.336 --> 25:27.328
But you've also put up with a lot
over the years.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.831
Well, so has she.

25:30.442 --> 25:32.103
Dad, I'm glad you didn't split up...

25:32.277 --> 25:34.677
...but I would have understood
if you had.

25:34.847 --> 25:36.838
Do you know why we didn't?

25:37.983 --> 25:41.441
Not really. She realized
she couldn't do any better?

25:41.620 --> 25:43.110
Not quite.

25:43.288 --> 25:46.655
Caleb, the Lord did a work in us.

25:46.825 --> 25:48.850
In both of us.

25:50.229 --> 25:51.958
The Lord?

25:52.798 --> 25:55.494
- You're giving credit to God?
- Why does that bother you?

25:55.667 --> 25:57.931
You've always believed in God.

25:59.271 --> 26:02.672
If there's a God out there, he's not
interested in me and my problems.

26:02.841 --> 26:06.538
I disagree.
I'd say he's very interested.

26:06.712 --> 26:08.179
Then where's he been in my life?

26:08.347 --> 26:11.316
He's been at work all around you.
You just haven't realized it.

26:11.483 --> 26:14.975
You haven't exactly
given him an open invitation.

26:20.259 --> 26:21.851
What is this place?

26:23.061 --> 26:24.926
Used to be a summer camp
across the lake.

26:25.097 --> 26:27.565
I think this must be a part of it.

26:29.301 --> 26:33.761
Son, I used to be
where you are right now.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.933
God didn't matter to me.

26:37.109 --> 26:39.134
But I can't say that anymore.

26:39.311 --> 26:41.779
I never understood why Jesus
had to die on the cross...

26:41.947 --> 26:43.380
Dad, please.

26:43.548 --> 26:45.743
We had this conversation
last month.

26:45.918 --> 26:49.581
I'm glad this new faith is working
for you and Mom, I really am.

26:49.755 --> 26:51.347
It's just...

26:51.623 --> 26:53.591
It's not for me.

26:59.331 --> 27:00.730
Caleb...

27:01.733 --> 27:04.793
...is there anything in you
that wants to save your marriage?

27:05.871 --> 27:08.931
Maybe. If Catherine wanted to,
but she doesn't. She wants divorce.

27:09.341 --> 27:10.638
Is that what you want?

27:11.343 --> 27:13.368
I want peace.

27:13.545 --> 27:15.172
But what difference does it make?

27:15.347 --> 27:17.611
She signs the papers, Dad,
it's all over.

27:19.518 --> 27:22.282
Have you agreed
to start the process with her?

27:22.688 --> 27:25.452
No, but I think we both understand
where this is all headed.

27:25.624 --> 27:28.058
I've got plans
to meet with my lawyer tomorrow.

27:28.226 --> 27:30.626
Caleb, I want you
to do something for me.

27:30.796 --> 27:31.820
What?

27:32.331 --> 27:35.129
I want you to hold off on the divorce
for 40 days.

27:36.802 --> 27:37.826
Why?

27:38.770 --> 27:41.364
I'm gonna send you
something in the mail.

27:41.907 --> 27:43.966
Something that'll take you
that long to do.

27:45.310 --> 27:49.110
- What is it?
- It's what saved our marriage.

27:50.482 --> 27:53.679
Dad, if this is a religious thing,
I'd rather you didn't.

27:53.852 --> 27:56.878
Look at it as a gift from your father.

27:57.055 --> 28:00.115
Take one day at a time,
then see what happens.

28:01.326 --> 28:06.628
Please, son.
If for no other reason, do it for me.

28:06.798 --> 28:08.891
I'm asking as your father.

28:13.238 --> 28:16.173
- Forty days?
- Forty days.

28:30.522 --> 28:33.013
- Eating alone?
- Well, hello, Dr. Keller.

28:33.191 --> 28:34.681
- Gavin.
- Gavin, sorry.

28:34.860 --> 28:36.259
- How are you?
- I'm doing well.

28:36.428 --> 28:38.419
I just need a place
to put my plate down.

28:38.597 --> 28:40.030
Is this spot reserved?

28:40.198 --> 28:43.065
Deidra was supposed to meet me,
but you're welcome to join us.

28:43.235 --> 28:46.329
Well, if you're gonna twist my arm,
I don't want any trouble.

28:51.176 --> 28:53.542
Are you gonna eat
wearing your clean white coat?

28:53.712 --> 28:55.680
I need to keep up
with the latest fashions.

28:55.847 --> 28:58.407
It seems all the doctors
are wearing one these days.

28:58.583 --> 29:01.074
But it's probably not too smart
while I'm eating.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.420
I didn't know
doctors cared about fashion.

29:03.588 --> 29:05.749
We keep up
with the attractive fashions...

29:05.924 --> 29:08.154
...the Public Relations
employees wear.

29:08.326 --> 29:09.793
I see.

29:09.961 --> 29:12.225
Since there's
only one person in that category...

29:12.397 --> 29:13.864
...I'm sure she'd feel honored.

29:14.032 --> 29:16.398
She should. She's pretty amazing.

29:30.816 --> 29:33.910
Hey, you look good.

29:36.488 --> 29:40.390
Thanks. I try to take care of myself.

29:40.559 --> 29:42.652
You like this song?

29:43.728 --> 29:45.753
Oh, yeah.

29:46.998 --> 29:48.829
You feel that?

29:49.501 --> 29:53.460
It's called chemistry, and we got it.

29:55.607 --> 29:57.336
Wayne won't leave you.

30:03.982 --> 30:07.543
- Hey, man, you seen my bag in here?
- No, I ain't seen it.

30:07.719 --> 30:09.949
All right. It's probably in my locker.

30:14.159 --> 30:16.059
Where were we?

30:27.472 --> 30:30.100
Oh, come on. That ain't funny.

30:30.275 --> 30:31.367
This ain't no show.

30:32.477 --> 30:33.774
This is me-time.

30:35.347 --> 30:36.507
Terrell!

30:37.048 --> 30:38.606
Wayne.

30:42.154 --> 30:45.180
Forty days? Does Catherine know?

30:45.724 --> 30:46.952
I'm not gonna tell her.

30:47.125 --> 30:49.923
If she wants to go ahead and file,
that's up to her.

30:50.395 --> 30:52.693
Divorce is a hard thing, man.

30:53.165 --> 30:54.496
Well, if it brings peace...

30:54.666 --> 30:58.124
But, Caleb,
you want the right kind of peace.

30:58.303 --> 30:59.463
What do you mean by that?

31:00.672 --> 31:02.936
You know what that ring
on your finger means?

31:03.108 --> 31:04.666
- Means I'm married.
- Yeah.

31:04.843 --> 31:06.868
It also means
you made a lifelong covenant.

31:07.045 --> 31:09.809
You putting on that ring
while saying your vows.

31:09.981 --> 31:11.243
The sad part about it is...

31:11.416 --> 31:13.680
...when most people promise
for better or worse...

31:13.852 --> 31:15.877
...they really only mean
for the better.

31:18.156 --> 31:21.091
Catherine and I were in love
when we got married, but today...

31:21.259 --> 31:23.489
...we're two very different people,
all right?

31:23.662 --> 31:25.926
It's just not working out anymore.

31:29.334 --> 31:32.997
Caleb, salt and pepper
are completely different.

31:34.072 --> 31:37.041
Their makeup is different,
their taste and their color.

31:37.209 --> 31:39.109
But you always see them together.

31:39.778 --> 31:41.336
And when you...

31:42.347 --> 31:43.609
Hold on just a second.

31:51.723 --> 31:53.281
What are you doing?

31:55.927 --> 31:58.293
Michael. Hey.

31:58.697 --> 32:00.528
What'd you do that for?

32:06.404 --> 32:11.034
Caleb, when two people get married,
it's for better or for worse.

32:11.209 --> 32:13.109
For richer or for poorer.

32:13.845 --> 32:16.405
In sickness and in health.

32:16.581 --> 32:17.605
I know that.

32:17.782 --> 32:20.478
But marriages aren't fireproof.
Sometimes, you get burned.

32:22.354 --> 32:25.448
Fireproof doesn't mean
that a fire will never come...

32:25.624 --> 32:28.650
...but that when it comes,
you'll be able to withstand it.

32:29.494 --> 32:32.554
- You didn't have to glue them.
- Don't do it, Caleb.

32:32.731 --> 32:35.894
If you pull them apart now,
you'll break either one or both of them.

32:38.303 --> 32:40.897
I am not a perfect person,
but better than most.

32:41.072 --> 32:43.939
And if my marriage is failing,
it is not all my fault.

32:44.109 --> 32:46.669
But, Caleb, I've seen you
run into a burning building...

32:46.845 --> 32:48.904
...to save people
you don't even know.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.345
But you're gonna let your own
marriage just burn to the ground.

32:54.619 --> 32:56.678
Michael, you are my friend.

32:56.855 --> 32:59.881
And I have allowed you
to speak freely with me on this job.

33:00.058 --> 33:01.116
Don't abuse it.

33:45.804 --> 33:49.865
<i>My son, this 40-day journey
cannot be taken lightly.</i>

33:50.041 --> 33:52.976
<i>It is a challenging
and often difficult process...</i>

33:53.144 --> 33:55.237
<i>...but an incredibly fulfilling one.</i>

33:55.413 --> 33:58.348
<i>If you will commit
to a day at a time for 40 days...</i>

33:58.516 --> 34:01.974
<i>...the results could change your life
and your marriage.</i>

34:02.153 --> 34:06.317
<i>Consider it a dare from others
who have done it before you.</i>

34:07.459 --> 34:10.826
<i>Day one: The first part of this dare
is fairly simple.</i>

34:10.995 --> 34:13.485
<i>Although love is communicated
in a number of ways...</i>

34:13.665 --> 34:16.759
<i>...our words often reflect
the condition of our heart.</i>

34:16.935 --> 34:17.958
<i>For the next day...</i>

34:18.136 --> 34:21.003
<i>...resolve to say nothing negative
to your spouse at all.</i>

34:21.172 --> 34:24.141
<i>If the temptation arises,
choose not to say anything.</i>

34:24.309 --> 34:27.472
<i>It's better to hold your tongue
than to say something you'll regret.</i>

34:27.645 --> 34:31.547
<i>Be quick to listen,
slow to speak and slow to get angry.</i>

34:31.716 --> 34:33.911
<i>James 1: 19.</i>

34:48.333 --> 34:51.393
Would you have time
to take that to the dry-cleaners today?

34:51.770 --> 34:55.206
Think after two days off, you would
have already taken care of that.

35:09.454 --> 35:10.478
<i>Day two:</i>

35:10.655 --> 35:14.887
<i>It is difficult to demonstrate love
when you feel little to no motivation.</i>

35:15.059 --> 35:18.392
<i>But love in its truest sense
is not based on feelings...</i>

35:18.563 --> 35:21.225
<i>...but a determination
to show thoughtful actions...</i>

35:21.399 --> 35:23.731
<i>...even when there seems
to be no reward.</i>

35:23.902 --> 35:26.769
<i>In addition to saying nothing negative
to your spouse today...</i>

35:26.938 --> 35:32.570
<i>...do at least one unexpected gesture
as an act of kindness.</i>

35:57.402 --> 35:59.563
I poured your coffee.

35:59.737 --> 36:01.830
I don't have time for coffee.

36:24.496 --> 36:25.520
<i>Day three:</i>

36:25.697 --> 36:29.428
<i>Whatever you put your time,
energy and money into...</i>

36:29.601 --> 36:31.432
<i>...will become
more important to you.</i>

36:31.603 --> 36:34.436
<i>It's hard to care
for something you're not investing in.</i>

36:34.606 --> 36:37.666
<i>Along with refraining
from any negative comments...</i>

36:37.842 --> 36:41.710
<i>...buy your wife something that says
you were thinking of her today.</i>

36:42.747 --> 36:46.183
Yeah, I need to order some flowers
or something for my wife.

36:46.351 --> 36:48.512
No. No, it doesn't matter.

36:49.287 --> 36:51.721
Sure. How much does that cost?

36:51.890 --> 36:55.883
Forty-five?
Do you have something cheaper?

36:56.628 --> 37:00.359
Yeah, yeah, that's more like it.
Let's go with the 25.

37:00.532 --> 37:03.262
How about a box of chocolates
or something?

37:03.434 --> 37:05.026
How much is that?

37:06.070 --> 37:07.901
You're killing me.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.369
That's better.

37:10.542 --> 37:13.136
Okay, how about
a little stuffed bear?

37:13.311 --> 37:15.176
All right, forget the bear.

37:15.580 --> 37:18.708
How long is it gonna take you
to throw something like that together?

37:36.701 --> 37:38.498
Man, you done lost your mind.

37:38.670 --> 37:41.605
Terrell, I can bench 300 right now.

37:41.773 --> 37:42.797
For real?

37:42.974 --> 37:45.408
Why can't we all come
to the same obvious conclusion?

37:45.577 --> 37:47.067
That I am the man.

37:47.245 --> 37:50.772
All I know is the man
left the thermal-imaging device...

37:50.949 --> 37:53.076
...on the bumper of the truck
last night.

37:53.251 --> 37:56.152
- That's an $8000 piece of equipment.
- My bad, captain.

37:56.321 --> 37:57.788
That doesn't change the fact...

37:57.956 --> 38:00.584
...when it comes to difficult situations,
I can take it.

38:00.758 --> 38:02.248
Man, I can't take this much ego.

38:02.427 --> 38:04.952
You've been bragging on yourself
for 10 minutes, man.

38:05.129 --> 38:06.687
It ain't bragging if it's true.

38:06.864 --> 38:09.856
Last week at the apartment fire,
I pulled off two attack lines...

38:10.034 --> 38:12.969
...laid my own supply line
and caught a hydrant in two minutes.

38:13.137 --> 38:15.901
- Other folks could do that, man.
- Not from this station.

38:16.074 --> 38:18.133
- Tom McBride could.
- At Station 4?

38:18.309 --> 38:21.301
He might do it in two and a half,
but he can't do it under two.

38:21.813 --> 38:23.075
- I don't know.
- Captain...

38:23.247 --> 38:25.579
...he's strong, but he's not as fast.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.775
I could take him
any day of the week.

38:29.187 --> 38:31.178
Wayne, you seem
pretty high on yourself.

38:31.356 --> 38:34.951
I think confidence is a good thing,
but you're over the top.

38:35.126 --> 38:36.525
Man, he way over the top.

38:36.694 --> 38:38.594
I can back it up.
That's all I'm saying.

38:39.631 --> 38:40.655
Wrath of God, baby.

38:40.832 --> 38:43.960
- What's that for?
- We're about to have a little contest.

38:44.135 --> 38:46.763
We're just gonna see
if Wayne really is the man.

38:46.938 --> 38:48.803
That is, if he's for the challenge.

38:48.973 --> 38:51.203
I'm all about this.

38:52.710 --> 38:54.075
All right.

38:54.812 --> 38:55.836
I'll go first.

38:56.014 --> 38:58.039
- What are you gonna do?
- Michael, time me.

38:58.216 --> 39:00.411
You got it. Ready?

39:00.585 --> 39:01.916
Go.

39:04.555 --> 39:06.648
No way.

39:06.824 --> 39:08.985
Man, you crazy.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.560
He gonna drink the whole thing.

39:24.075 --> 39:25.702
Twenty-three seconds.

39:29.013 --> 39:30.878
All right, man. You're up.

39:31.049 --> 39:33.847
All right. That was impressive.

39:34.018 --> 39:36.213
Till I do it under 20.

39:36.854 --> 39:38.913
- Time me.
- Oh, I'll time you.

39:39.357 --> 39:40.949
- Ready?
- Ladies.

39:41.125 --> 39:42.490
Go.

39:47.031 --> 39:48.259
- Come on, Wayne.
- It's hot.

39:48.433 --> 39:50.458
- Go, Wayne.
- That's it, Wayne.

39:50.635 --> 39:52.364
How about you take it?

39:54.372 --> 39:56.567
- You gotta drink that, bro.
- Fourteen seconds.

39:58.309 --> 40:00.573
- Come on.
- It burns!

40:01.579 --> 40:03.706
Where the man at now, huh?

40:03.881 --> 40:06.349
I thought he said he could take it.

40:07.385 --> 40:09.250
My mouth's on fire!

40:11.089 --> 40:13.853
Captain, how'd you do that, man?

40:14.025 --> 40:15.549
You could do it too, Terrell...

40:15.727 --> 40:18.389
...if you replaced yours
with tomato juice.

40:20.698 --> 40:24.566
That is classic. That was awesome.

40:26.404 --> 40:28.304
Dr. Anderson?

40:28.473 --> 40:31.033
Wanted to remind you
about your interview in 10 minutes.

40:31.209 --> 40:33.006
Catherine, thank you. I'll be there.

40:33.177 --> 40:35.270
Congratulations
on your cancer-research award.

40:35.446 --> 40:38.313
- You deserve it.
- I appreciate that.

40:38.483 --> 40:39.711
This is Catherine.

40:39.884 --> 40:43.342
Hey, it's Caleb.
I wanted to call and check on you.

40:44.255 --> 40:47.383
You wanted to check on me?
What for?

40:48.659 --> 40:50.854
You know,
just see if you needed anything.

40:52.497 --> 40:54.590
You called to see
if I needed anything?

40:54.766 --> 40:58.133
<i>Right, yeah. You want me
to bring something home for you...</i>

40:58.302 --> 41:01.135
<i>...or get something from the store
in the morning?</i>

41:01.305 --> 41:04.706
Caleb, you never asked me this
before. What's going on?

41:04.876 --> 41:07.936
I just wanted to see
if you needed anything, that's it.

41:08.112 --> 41:09.807
<i>I'm fine.</i>

41:10.448 --> 41:11.972
Okay.

41:12.650 --> 41:14.675
All right, well...

41:14.852 --> 41:16.342
...goodbye.

41:22.326 --> 41:25.056
Day four, done.

41:30.067 --> 41:32.399
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

41:32.570 --> 41:34.401
Confused.

41:35.139 --> 41:37.835
- My husband's acting weird.
- What's he doing?

41:38.376 --> 41:41.868
Well, in the last few days...

41:42.046 --> 41:47.245
...he has fixed me coffee,
bought me these pitiful little flowers...

41:47.418 --> 41:50.683
...and just now,
called just to see if I'm doing okay.

41:51.189 --> 41:53.157
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:53.324 --> 41:54.723
I'll tell you what he's doing.

41:54.892 --> 41:57.190
He's trying to butter you up
for a divorce.

41:57.361 --> 41:58.692
And why would he do that?

41:58.863 --> 42:00.728
Before my cousin Luwanna
got a divorce...

42:00.898 --> 42:02.490
...her husband did the same thing.

42:02.667 --> 42:05.192
He started acting nice and sweet,
next thing we know...

42:05.369 --> 42:07.929
...he walks away with the house
and most of their money.

42:08.105 --> 42:12.007
He hasn't even talked to her since.
Don't you let him deceive you, girl.

42:39.070 --> 42:41.163
Did you clear your history?

42:41.939 --> 42:43.668
What?

42:43.841 --> 42:47.368
Did you wipe the websites off so
nobody would see where you've been?

42:52.950 --> 42:55.214
You know, Caleb,
you're not fooling anybody.

42:55.386 --> 42:56.978
I know what you're trying to do...

42:57.154 --> 42:59.918
...buying me flowers
and calling me at work.

43:00.625 --> 43:02.183
And what is that?

43:02.360 --> 43:05.056
I'm meeting with a lawyer next week,
and don't you think...

43:05.229 --> 43:07.720
...I'm buying into
this nice-guy routine.

43:07.899 --> 43:10.060
What are you talking about?

43:11.269 --> 43:13.533
You're not getting one dime
more than you deserve.

43:13.704 --> 43:16.400
When this divorce is final,
I'm taking my share.

43:16.574 --> 43:20.135
- Is that what you think I'm doing?
- No, I know that's what you're doing.

43:20.311 --> 43:21.403
Well, you're wrong.

43:21.579 --> 43:24.548
You never assume I would do anything
worthy of respect.

43:24.715 --> 43:26.410
- Anything honorable.
- Honorable?

43:26.617 --> 43:29.142
Honorable?
What were you just looking at, Caleb?

43:29.320 --> 43:32.448
What was on that computer screen?
Was that honorable?

43:32.623 --> 43:34.090
Who do you think you're fooling?

43:34.258 --> 43:37.125
Do you know why your sweet
little gestures mean nothing to me?

43:37.295 --> 43:39.559
It's because that's the kind of man
you've become.

43:39.730 --> 43:41.823
When you're alone,
that's what you default to.

43:41.999 --> 43:44.399
And there is nothing honorable
about it.

44:11.963 --> 44:13.692
Mr. Rudolph.

44:14.598 --> 44:16.225
Caleb.

44:32.883 --> 44:35.078
- Hello?
- It's not working, Dad.

44:35.252 --> 44:36.310
<i>What's not working?</i>

44:36.487 --> 44:38.853
This whole love dare thing.
It is not working.

44:39.557 --> 44:41.115
Tell me what's going on.

44:41.792 --> 44:44.056
I have been doing everything
that it says to do...

44:44.228 --> 44:46.662
...and she has completely rejected
all of it.

44:46.831 --> 44:49.163
Caleb, this process takes 40 days,
not four.

44:49.333 --> 44:51.597
<i>What's the point of going down
a dead-end road...</i>

44:51.769 --> 44:54.704
<i>- ... when it's not going anywhere?
- You don't know that yet.</i>

44:54.872 --> 44:56.203
<i>Caleb, you're not a quitter.</i>

44:56.374 --> 45:00.470
And something tells me
you're doing just enough to get by.

45:01.412 --> 45:02.845
Am I right?

45:08.619 --> 45:11.713
- I feel nothing.
- I understand, son.

45:11.889 --> 45:14.357
<i>But this is not based on feelings.</i>

45:14.525 --> 45:15.822
<i>It's a decision.</i>

45:15.993 --> 45:18.120
You can't give up yet.

45:18.295 --> 45:20.388
Keep taking a day at a time.

45:23.667 --> 45:24.691
Yes, sir.

45:25.569 --> 45:27.230
I love you, son.

45:28.305 --> 45:30.000
You too, Dad.

45:38.649 --> 45:40.344
How is he?

45:41.085 --> 45:43.781
We've gotta start
praying for him more.

45:46.857 --> 45:49.519
Mama, I don't know what to do.

45:50.694 --> 45:55.222
I know you always told me to hang on
during the hard times, but...

45:58.502 --> 46:01.960
You don't know
what I've been competing with.

46:02.673 --> 46:04.971
I mean, when he look...

46:10.581 --> 46:14.813
He makes me feel so humiliated.

46:15.553 --> 46:18.147
And he doesn't even know it.

46:21.859 --> 46:25.886
When did I stop
being good enough for him?

47:38.269 --> 47:40.237
So, what day are you on?

47:41.505 --> 47:43.370
- Eighteen.
- And?

47:44.975 --> 47:46.374
And it's still difficult.

47:47.178 --> 47:50.204
Every day has me adding
a new concept to the way I treat her.

47:50.848 --> 47:51.872
For example?

47:52.550 --> 47:54.677
Well, here.

47:54.852 --> 47:57.980
Day 16 was about praying for her.
I kind of skipped that one.

47:58.756 --> 48:01.919
Day 17 is about listening to her.

48:02.092 --> 48:04.356
Eighteen's about
studying her again.

48:04.895 --> 48:06.522
- Studying her?
- Yeah.

48:06.730 --> 48:08.197
Here.

48:08.933 --> 48:11.993
"When a man is trying to win the heart
of a woman, he studies her.

48:12.169 --> 48:14.729
He learns her likes, dislikes,
habits and hobbies.

48:14.905 --> 48:17.135
But after he wins her heart
and marries her...

48:17.308 --> 48:19.503
...he often stops learning about her.

48:19.677 --> 48:21.804
If the amount he studied her
before marriage...

48:21.979 --> 48:25.210
...was equal to a high school degree,
he should continue to learn...

48:25.382 --> 48:28.408
...until he gains a college degree,
a master's degree...

48:28.586 --> 48:30.611
...and ultimately, a doctorate degree.

48:30.788 --> 48:35.316
It is a lifelong journey that draws
his heart ever closer to hers. "

48:35.492 --> 48:38.552
That's a pretty good concept.
I never thought about it like that.

48:40.264 --> 48:42.528
So do you study Tina?

48:42.700 --> 48:45.396
Yeah, but I don't think
I got my college degree on her yet.

48:47.271 --> 48:50.069
So tell me a little bit more
about the studying her.

48:50.241 --> 48:53.176
I'm supposed to make her
a candlelight dinner...

48:53.344 --> 48:55.608
...and then ask her
a whole list of questions.

48:56.113 --> 48:58.104
Well, my advice is go all out.

48:58.849 --> 48:59.873
Meaning?

49:00.050 --> 49:03.042
Don't go cheap. If you don't cook,
get it from a good restaurant.

49:03.220 --> 49:07.589
Take it home, use your best dishes,
glasses, music, everything.

49:07.758 --> 49:09.623
Make it a memorable date.

49:12.930 --> 49:14.227
Man, what you talking about?

49:14.398 --> 49:17.561
- You ain't had a date in a year.
- I'm like a fine wine.

49:17.735 --> 49:20.033
I need about 35 years
to reach perfection.

49:20.204 --> 49:23.662
But the lady that gets Wayne Floyd,
she'll get the complete package.

49:23.841 --> 49:25.934
- You mean complete wreckage.
- No.

49:26.410 --> 49:29.106
I'm 255 pounds of pure love.

49:29.280 --> 49:32.215
All you need to make marriage work
is a little bit of romance.

49:32.383 --> 49:34.078
And that comes from right here.

49:34.251 --> 49:37.311
Man, that's easy to say
when you ain't never been married.

49:37.488 --> 49:39.080
It's a lot harder than you think.

49:39.256 --> 49:41.952
One day I'm gonna walk in
with a tanned beauty on my arm.

49:42.126 --> 49:43.787
I'll show you how easy it can be.

49:43.961 --> 49:46.657
The only thing you'll come in with
hanging from your arm...

49:46.830 --> 49:48.923
...is a bucket of chicken.

49:50.501 --> 49:52.230
It was tomato juice.

50:04.682 --> 50:07.378
Tomato juice? Man, that's wrong!

50:07.551 --> 50:10.179
- That's wrong.
- What's wrong?

50:10.354 --> 50:12.618
I drank the real stuff
and he drank tomato juice?

50:12.790 --> 50:13.916
You just got that?

50:14.091 --> 50:15.820
Do you know
what that stuff did to me?

50:15.993 --> 50:17.358
Go to bed, Wayne.

50:17.528 --> 50:20.986
- There's some serious repercussions.
- Quiet.

50:21.165 --> 50:23.190
Oh, it's on now.

50:24.134 --> 50:26.364
Done lit a fuse.

50:26.537 --> 50:30.029
Somebody's gonna get
a karate-chop sandwich.

51:45.149 --> 51:46.275
What are you doing?

51:49.553 --> 51:51.987
Maybe I'd like to have dinner
with my wife.

51:57.861 --> 51:59.954
Let me be real clear with you
about something.

52:02.966 --> 52:05.594
I do not love you.

52:51.215 --> 52:53.046
Oh, son.

52:53.750 --> 52:56.241
This is when it gets hard.

52:57.588 --> 52:59.988
- Hello, Caleb.
- We're done, Dad.

53:00.157 --> 53:04.253
I am not gonna keep doing this.
I have tried and there's nothing there.

53:04.428 --> 53:05.656
It's not worth it.

53:05.829 --> 53:08.195
I understand, son,
but you're halfway there...

53:08.365 --> 53:10.356
...which was the most difficult
for us too.

53:10.534 --> 53:13.503
But at least you had some hope.
She has given me nothing.

53:13.670 --> 53:16.195
There was a point
when we had no hope either.

53:16.373 --> 53:18.466
Our marriage should have ended,
Caleb.

53:18.642 --> 53:21.008
You can't listen to the way you feel
at the moment.

53:21.178 --> 53:22.406
<i>She's seen you trying.</i>

53:22.579 --> 53:27.107
No, she doesn't care, Dad.
None of this means anything to her.

53:27.284 --> 53:28.774
Dad, I tried.

53:30.487 --> 53:31.784
Caleb, are you off tomorrow?

53:32.756 --> 53:33.780
Yeah, why?

53:34.324 --> 53:36.815
I'm coming to see you.
We can talk then.

53:38.128 --> 53:39.823
Dad, you don't have to do that.

53:40.364 --> 53:43.390
I want to, son. I'd like to come.

53:45.502 --> 53:47.367
All right.

54:14.131 --> 54:15.598
Dad, I gotta be honest with you.

54:15.766 --> 54:19.202
I feel bad that you drove four hours
just to come see me.

54:19.369 --> 54:22.964
It was good.
It gave me time to think and pray.

54:23.140 --> 54:25.938
So, what are you on, Day 20?

54:26.109 --> 54:29.044
- Yeah, yeah, something like that.
- Yeah.

54:29.212 --> 54:31.578
I'd say the halfway point
was the hardest for us.

54:32.082 --> 54:33.640
Why?

54:33.817 --> 54:37.583
Well, it's when you determine
whether your heart's in it or not.

54:37.754 --> 54:41.246
Makes you check your real motives
when things get difficult.

54:41.692 --> 54:43.751
Yeah?
Did Mom give you a hard time?

54:43.927 --> 54:47.761
No. I thought your mother
had a pretty good attitude about it.

54:47.931 --> 54:50.331
Yeah, well,
Catherine's not buying any of it.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.060
- Why do you think that is?
- Because she doesn't love me.

54:53.236 --> 54:54.498
She doesn't even like me.

54:54.671 --> 54:58.402
Dad, she's just about ignored
everything I've done.

54:58.575 --> 55:01.305
Are you reading everything
on each page?

55:02.980 --> 55:05.244
You mean the Bible verses
at the bottom of it?

55:05.415 --> 55:07.144
No, I'm not, Dad.

55:07.317 --> 55:10.912
- I told you, that is not what I need.
- And what do you need?

55:11.088 --> 55:15.616
I need Catherine to wake up to the fact
that we are about to get a divorce.

55:15.792 --> 55:19.125
And I'm trying to prevent that,
but I cannot do it by myself.

55:19.296 --> 55:23.130
That may be true,
but I think you need more than that.

55:24.468 --> 55:27.028
Dad, if you're gonna tell me
I need Jesus, please don't.

55:27.204 --> 55:29.536
I don't need a crutch
to get through life.

55:29.706 --> 55:31.867
Oh, son,
Jesus is much more than a crutch.

55:32.042 --> 55:35.239
He's become the most significant part
of our lives.

55:35.412 --> 55:36.936
Dad, why do you keep saying that?

55:37.114 --> 55:40.345
He's the most significant part?
How is that?

55:40.517 --> 55:45.454
When I realized who I was
and who he was...

55:45.622 --> 55:47.613
...I realized my need for him.

55:47.791 --> 55:51.056
I needed his forgiveness
and salvation.

55:52.295 --> 55:54.490
See, I don't understand that.

55:54.665 --> 55:58.465
Why do I need his salvation?
What, am I gonna be thrown into hell?

55:58.635 --> 56:01.866
For what? Because I got divorced?

56:02.039 --> 56:03.563
No.

56:03.740 --> 56:06.140
Because you violated his standards.

56:06.309 --> 56:08.834
What? Thou shall not kill?

56:09.012 --> 56:11.276
Dad, I help people.
I am a good person.

56:11.448 --> 56:12.915
According to you.

56:13.083 --> 56:15.643
But God doesn't judge
by your standards.

56:15.819 --> 56:18.014
- He uses his.
- And what are his?

56:18.188 --> 56:20.349
Well, truth.

56:20.524 --> 56:21.548
- Okay.
- Love.

56:21.725 --> 56:23.386
- I'm honest.
- Faithfulness.

56:23.560 --> 56:26.028
I care about people.
I am those things.

56:26.196 --> 56:27.629
Sometimes.

56:27.798 --> 56:32.701
But have you loved God,
the one who gave you life?

56:32.869 --> 56:38.307
His standards are so high,
he considers hatred to be murder...

56:38.475 --> 56:42.502
...and lust to be adultery.

56:46.349 --> 56:49.341
Dad, what about
all the good I've done?

56:49.519 --> 56:53.046
Son, saving someone from a fire
does not make you right with God.

56:53.223 --> 56:55.521
You've broken his commandments.

56:55.692 --> 56:58.286
And one day,
you'll answer to him for that.

57:06.369 --> 57:08.234
Caleb...

57:08.405 --> 57:11.067
...if I ask you why
you're so frustrated with Catherine...

57:11.241 --> 57:12.902
...what would you say?

57:17.080 --> 57:18.843
She's stubborn.

57:19.015 --> 57:21.711
She makes everything
difficult for me.

57:21.885 --> 57:23.546
She's ungrateful.

57:23.720 --> 57:26.382
She's constantly griping
about something.

57:26.556 --> 57:28.888
Has she thanked you
the last 20 days?

57:29.059 --> 57:30.356
No.

57:30.527 --> 57:32.392
And you'd think
after I washed the car...

57:32.562 --> 57:35.224
...I've changed the oil,
do the dishes, clean the house...

57:35.398 --> 57:38.697
...that she would try to show me
a little bit of gratitude.

57:38.869 --> 57:40.530
Well, she doesn't.

57:40.704 --> 57:44.640
In fact, when I come home,
she makes me feel like I'm an enemy.

57:44.808 --> 57:46.708
I'm not even welcome
in my own home, Dad.

57:46.877 --> 57:49.141
That is what really ticks me off.

57:49.312 --> 57:52.475
Dad, for the last three weeks,
I have bent over backwards for her.

57:52.649 --> 57:56.415
I have tried to demonstrate
that I still care about this relationship.

57:56.586 --> 57:59.282
I bought her flowers,
which she threw away.

57:59.456 --> 58:03.256
I have taken her insults
and her sarcasm, but last night was it.

58:03.426 --> 58:07.021
I made dinner for her, I did
everything I could to demonstrate...

58:07.197 --> 58:09.825
...that I care about her,
to show value for her...

58:10.000 --> 58:11.661
...and she spat in my face.

58:11.835 --> 58:15.362
She does not deserve this, Dad.
I am not doing it anymore.

58:15.539 --> 58:19.942
How am I supposed to show love
to somebody over and over and over...

58:20.110 --> 58:22.408
...who constantly rejects me?

58:25.982 --> 58:27.415
That's a good question.

58:37.227 --> 58:39.354
Dad, that is not what I'm doing.

58:40.297 --> 58:42.026
Isn't it?

58:42.866 --> 58:43.992
No...

58:44.167 --> 58:45.930
Dad, that is not what this is about.

58:46.102 --> 58:48.332
Son, you just asked me:

58:48.505 --> 58:50.769
"How can someone show love
over and over again...

58:50.941 --> 58:53.535
...when they're constantly rejected?"

58:53.877 --> 58:56.072
Caleb, the answer is:

58:56.246 --> 58:57.770
You can't love her...

58:57.948 --> 59:00.974
...because you can't give her
what you don't have.

59:04.688 --> 59:08.488
I couldn't truly love your mother
till I understood what love really was.

59:09.559 --> 59:13.017
It's not because
I get some reward out of it.

59:13.196 --> 59:15.357
I've now made a decision
to love your mother...

59:15.532 --> 59:17.796
...whether she deserves it or not.

59:19.169 --> 59:23.037
Son, God loves you
even though you don't deserve it.

59:23.673 --> 59:26.164
Even though you've rejected him.

59:26.643 --> 59:28.372
Spat in his face.

59:30.380 --> 59:35.283
God sent Jesus to die on the cross
and take the punishment for your sin...

59:35.819 --> 59:37.878
...because he loves you.

59:39.189 --> 59:42.886
The cross was offensive to me
until I came to it.

59:44.194 --> 59:46.219
But when I did...

59:47.764 --> 59:49.994
...Jesus Christ changed my life.

59:50.500 --> 59:53.264
That's when I truly began
to love your mom.

59:55.472 --> 59:59.101
Son, I can't settle this for you.

59:59.276 --> 01:00:01.767
This is between you and the Lord.

01:00:01.945 --> 01:00:05.540
But I love you too much
not to tell you the truth.

01:00:07.183 --> 01:00:10.118
Can't you see that you need him?

01:00:16.192 --> 01:00:19.855
Can't you see
that you need his forgiveness?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.592
Yes.

01:00:28.204 --> 01:00:30.764
Will you trust him with your life?

01:01:00.303 --> 01:01:02.271
Waffle time.

01:01:02.772 --> 01:01:05.206
Hey, man,
I'd like to talk to you about something.

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:07.036
What's that?

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.371
- Well...
- Hey, captain.

01:01:10.246 --> 01:01:12.942
I think B shift
is trying to pull a joke on us, man.

01:01:13.116 --> 01:01:14.947
Salt and pepper shaker
won't come apart.

01:01:15.118 --> 01:01:16.915
Hey, toss them over here.

01:01:18.555 --> 01:01:21.115
Thanks. Don't forget
to mop the kitchen after breakfast.

01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:22.690
Yes, sir.

01:01:25.462 --> 01:01:27.362
You wanna tell me something?

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.829
It's about your faith.

01:01:32.002 --> 01:01:34.232
- My faith?
- Yeah.

01:01:34.404 --> 01:01:35.996
What about it?

01:01:36.873 --> 01:01:39.569
Well, I'm in.

01:01:39.743 --> 01:01:41.040
You're in?

01:01:41.678 --> 01:01:43.305
Yeah, I'm in.

01:01:45.148 --> 01:01:46.979
Are you saying
that you wanna be in?

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.210
- I'm saying I'm in.
- You're really in?

01:01:50.387 --> 01:01:52.651
- Really.
- You can't be half in and say you're in.

01:01:52.822 --> 01:01:55.950
- You gotta be all in, brother.
- I'm saying I'm all in.

01:01:56.126 --> 01:01:57.718
Caleb, I can't believe it, man.

01:01:57.894 --> 01:01:59.919
- Yeah.
- You're my brother.

01:02:00.096 --> 01:02:01.427
- I'm your brother?
- Yeah, man.

01:02:01.598 --> 01:02:05.398
You're my brother from another mother
but now we got the same father.

01:02:05.568 --> 01:02:07.468
- What?
- I'll explain it to you later, man.

01:02:07.637 --> 01:02:09.070
This is awesome.

01:02:09.239 --> 01:02:11.434
- Does Catherine know?
- No.

01:02:11.608 --> 01:02:14.702
No, I don't think she'd care right now,
to tell you the truth.

01:02:14.878 --> 01:02:18.245
She hasn't been taking too well
to this whole love dare thing.

01:02:18.415 --> 01:02:21.248
- But you're not done yet, right?
- No, I'm day 21 out of 40.

01:02:21.618 --> 01:02:24.086
But I'll be honest with you.
Up to this point...

01:02:24.254 --> 01:02:26.916
...my heart's not been in it.
- That's what matters.

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.888
A woman can tell when you're
just going through the motions.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.187
That's absolutely right.

01:02:32.362 --> 01:02:35.024
- Hey, let me ask you a question.
- Go ahead.

01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:37.730
How did you get a good start
with Tina?

01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:39.459
Why is it so easy for you?

01:02:39.636 --> 01:02:42.605
Oh, it's not always been easy.
Marriage takes work, man.

01:02:43.206 --> 01:02:45.902
Tina is an incredible wife.

01:02:46.076 --> 01:02:48.135
But we learned a lot of lessons
the hard way.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.312
At least you haven't
had to face divorce.

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:58.378
I wish that were true.

01:02:59.456 --> 01:03:01.356
What does that mean?

01:03:01.524 --> 01:03:03.424
You and Tina
been struggling that much?

01:03:04.627 --> 01:03:08.358
Not me and Tina.
But I did with my first wife.

01:03:12.535 --> 01:03:14.093
What?

01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:17.005
You were married to someone
before Tina?

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.131
For one horrible year.

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:22.107
I got married for the wrong reasons.

01:03:22.278 --> 01:03:25.406
Then I turned around and got
a divorce for the wrong reasons.

01:03:25.748 --> 01:03:28.717
Man, I thought
I was just following my heart.

01:03:29.619 --> 01:03:31.678
Michael, I've worked with you
for five years.

01:03:31.855 --> 01:03:34.688
- You've never told me that.
- Because I'm not proud of it.

01:03:35.058 --> 01:03:37.652
It was before I gave my life
to the Lord...

01:03:37.827 --> 01:03:41.285
...and, man, I was just only concerned
about my rights and my needs.

01:03:41.464 --> 01:03:43.659
Man, I ruined her life.

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:46.961
But when I gave my life to God...

01:03:47.137 --> 01:03:49.731
...I tried to find her,
but she'd already remarried.

01:03:49.906 --> 01:03:53.342
So believe me when I tell you
I got a big scar.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:56.479
Man, God made marriage
to be for life.

01:03:57.914 --> 01:04:01.281
That's why you gotta keep your vows
to Catherine.

01:04:01.451 --> 01:04:04.943
You gotta beg God to teach you
how to be a good husband.

01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:08.682
And don't just follow your heart, man,
because your heart can be deceived.

01:04:09.159 --> 01:04:13.027
But you gotta lead your heart.

01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:21.101
It's just been hard for me, you know?

01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:23.171
I saw my parents again yesterday...

01:04:24.474 --> 01:04:27.068
...and, well,
Mom's not doing too well.

01:04:27.777 --> 01:04:31.838
It's amazing how much a stroke
can affect somebody's life.

01:04:32.015 --> 01:04:33.505
I just...

01:04:33.683 --> 01:04:36.049
I feel like she's trapped, you know?

01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:38.187
And Dad does his best
to communicate...

01:04:38.354 --> 01:04:40.754
...but it's hard for him too.

01:04:42.725 --> 01:04:44.386
Catherine, I'm so sorry.

01:04:44.894 --> 01:04:47.089
You seem very close to them.

01:04:47.263 --> 01:04:48.355
I am.

01:04:49.299 --> 01:04:52.598
They had me late in life so it was like
growing up with grandparents.

01:04:52.769 --> 01:04:54.031
So they spoiled you.

01:04:54.204 --> 01:04:56.502
Hey, now.
I think they did a pretty good job.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.999
They did.
They should be very proud.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:03.211
You know, you're kind of sweet
when you wanna be.

01:05:03.379 --> 01:05:05.142
Kind of?

01:05:05.315 --> 01:05:07.977
With some training,
I think you could be a fine gentleman.

01:05:08.151 --> 01:05:09.618
Well, are you offering lessons?

01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:14.549
So, what does your mom need?

01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:18.889
Well, a better wheelchair
and hospital bed...

01:05:19.062 --> 01:05:21.087
...would be at the top of the list.

01:05:21.264 --> 01:05:24.722
I've been working with
RMS Medical Supplies to get them...

01:05:24.901 --> 01:05:26.129
...but it's so expensive.

01:05:26.636 --> 01:05:29.537
Well, you can't put a price
on helping your mom.

01:05:29.706 --> 01:05:31.401
That's right.

01:05:32.075 --> 01:05:34.475
So it's worth the sacrifice.

01:05:34.644 --> 01:05:37.272
You know, they're lucky
to have you for a daughter.

01:05:39.949 --> 01:05:42.247
Don't look at me like that.
I'm trying to help.

01:05:42.418 --> 01:05:45.046
Why does it matter
what my bed looks like? I sleep in it.

01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:49.123
What if the chief walks through here?
My bed says I take my job seriously.

01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:51.817
Your bed says your mama didn't
help you make it up.

01:05:51.995 --> 01:05:53.826
Teaching a rookie
how to make his bed?

01:05:53.997 --> 01:05:55.828
Somebody's got to.

01:05:55.999 --> 01:05:59.025
That looks as bad as yours did
when I taught you.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.471
<i>Engine 2, Engine 1,
Area 1, Battalion 1.</i>

01:06:07.644 --> 01:06:10.010
<i>Respond to 20911 th Avenue.</i>

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:13.239
<i>Structure fire, residence.
Time out, 15:32.</i>

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:14.883
- Michael, you got that?
- Got it.

01:06:15.051 --> 01:06:16.848
- Wayne, let's roll.
- Got it.

01:06:29.766 --> 01:06:32.792
Engine 1 is en route
to 20911 th Avenue, structure fire.

01:06:32.969 --> 01:06:34.436
<i>10-4, Engine 1.</i>

01:06:34.604 --> 01:06:38.631
Be advised we've received numerous
calls regarding this structure fire.

01:06:38.941 --> 01:06:41.000
That means
there's something to this one.

01:06:41.177 --> 01:06:43.077
Make sure you're tightened up.

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.952
Remember your training.
Stay with your partner.

01:06:53.122 --> 01:06:54.521
Yes, sir.

01:06:54.691 --> 01:06:55.817
Engine 1 is 10-23.

01:06:55.992 --> 01:06:59.052
We have a single-story
brick dwelling, 30 percent involved.

01:06:59.228 --> 01:07:01.287
We'll be using
a 1 " and 3-quarter for rescue.

01:07:01.464 --> 01:07:03.659
We'll be 11 th Avenue Command.
Engine 2, bring me a line.

01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:07.496
Be advised there is a hydrant
right next to Engine 1.

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:09.729
<i>Unit 2's clear. One supply line.</i>

01:07:10.907 --> 01:07:12.898
Come on, rookie, let's go.

01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:15.470
You live here?
Is everyone out of the house?

01:07:15.645 --> 01:07:18.239
My daughter's in the neighbor's
house. This is our home.

01:07:18.414 --> 01:07:20.905
- Please, put that fire out.
- We will, just stay clear.

01:07:21.084 --> 01:07:22.949
- Please, please.
- Oh, no. No.

01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:25.349
Megan, Megan, where's Lacey?

01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:28.513
- She went home already.
- You mean she's not at your house?

01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:30.921
No, I was just talking to her
on the phone.

01:07:31.094 --> 01:07:32.994
Lacey!

01:07:34.163 --> 01:07:35.755
- You can't go in there.
- Lacey, no!

01:07:35.932 --> 01:07:38.366
- You can't go in there.
- Let me go. Please let me go.

01:07:38.801 --> 01:07:40.666
My baby!

01:07:40.837 --> 01:07:43.772
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:47.134
Lacey!

01:07:48.945 --> 01:07:51.243
My baby.

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:56.045
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.617
Let's go.

01:08:00.456 --> 01:08:02.390
- It's done.
- Charge.

01:08:10.199 --> 01:08:12.360
Lacey!

01:08:12.535 --> 01:08:13.627
Lacey!

01:08:14.837 --> 01:08:17.067
Lacey!

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:19.698
Lacey!

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:23.779
Lacey!

01:08:24.781 --> 01:08:27.773
- Get in there, guys, get in there.
- Lacey.

01:08:32.354 --> 01:08:35.483
Lacey! Lacey!

01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:37.787
Come on.
Over here, man. Over here.

01:08:47.937 --> 01:08:49.837
Back out, back out, back out.

01:09:04.921 --> 01:09:07.151
Over here!

01:09:07.657 --> 01:09:09.090
Over here!

01:09:17.433 --> 01:09:20.493
There's a hydrant over there.
Give me one supply line to Engine 1.

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:22.638
Hey, we got two people inside.
We need you.

01:09:22.805 --> 01:09:24.705
Hey, hurry up with that supply line.

01:09:24.874 --> 01:09:26.808
Get back in there, get back in there.

01:09:26.975 --> 01:09:29.604
Breathe. Breathe, Lacey.
Breathe for me.

01:09:31.514 --> 01:09:34.846
Captain, you gotta get out of the
house. The roof is about to give.

01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:37.781
<i>Captain, do you read me?
You've gotta get out.</i>

01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:45.558
God, get me out of here.
Get us out of here.

01:11:41.577 --> 01:11:43.238
There, there.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.842
Get the girl. Get the girl.

01:11:59.228 --> 01:12:00.627
With the x-ray showing that...

01:12:00.796 --> 01:12:03.924
...he's left with a partial thickness burn
to the arm.

01:12:09.038 --> 01:12:10.130
You look terrible.

01:12:13.175 --> 01:12:14.369
I feel terrible.

01:12:16.278 --> 01:12:17.540
You gonna be okay?

01:12:17.713 --> 01:12:20.477
He sustained some first-degree
burns, but he should be fine.

01:12:21.484 --> 01:12:23.714
So this is your husband?

01:12:26.255 --> 01:12:29.053
- Yes.
- You've got a hero on your hands.

01:12:29.225 --> 01:12:31.955
Sir, I need you to keep this arm
elevated for 24 hours...

01:12:32.128 --> 01:12:33.595
...to help the swelling go down.

01:12:33.763 --> 01:12:36.129
Come back in 48 hours
to get it checked out again.

01:12:36.298 --> 01:12:39.859
- Well, let me get out of your way.
- You're not in our way. You can stay.

01:12:40.036 --> 01:12:44.405
No, it's all right.
I'll let you do your job.

01:12:46.409 --> 01:12:48.843
I'm gonna get you more gauze
to take home with you...

01:12:49.011 --> 01:12:51.844
...and fill that prescription
for your pain, okay?

01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:04.151
I wouldn't put that ring
back on your finger...

01:13:04.326 --> 01:13:06.920
...until your hand
has a chance to heal.

01:13:08.564 --> 01:13:11.192
My hand's gonna have to heal
with this ring on my finger.

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:22.877
Mom, it'll be fine.

01:13:23.045 --> 01:13:25.445
It's gonna heal up
in a couple of weeks.

01:13:26.348 --> 01:13:30.682
Yes, I got it wrapped up right now.
Can I speak with Dad, please?

01:13:31.687 --> 01:13:32.745
Okay, Mom, I got it.

01:13:32.922 --> 01:13:35.823
Now, would you please
hand the phone to Dad?

01:13:36.192 --> 01:13:37.819
Thank you.

01:13:39.495 --> 01:13:42.396
Dad, would you please ask Mom
to cut me some slack?

01:13:42.565 --> 01:13:45.466
I'm a fireman.
I'm gonna be around fires.

01:13:46.035 --> 01:13:47.468
I know. I know, Dad.

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:51.367
I just don't like getting grilled
every time she picks up the phone.

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:57.179
Yeah. Today, Day 23.

01:13:57.346 --> 01:13:59.541
But it was hard this morning.

01:13:59.715 --> 01:14:02.548
Yeah, the newspaper called me twice
wanting an interview.

01:14:02.718 --> 01:14:06.313
Seems I'm a hero with everybody
in the world except my wife.

01:14:06.922 --> 01:14:09.516
No. No, I'm not giving up.

01:14:10.793 --> 01:14:12.420
Thanks, Dad.

01:14:13.462 --> 01:14:15.293
All right, I'll talk to you later.

01:14:15.464 --> 01:14:16.795
Bye.

01:15:07.449 --> 01:15:09.349
Caleb, what are you doing?

01:15:41.016 --> 01:15:43.780
Why is this so hard?

01:15:58.934 --> 01:16:01.926
<i>Day 23, watch out for parasites.</i>

01:16:02.338 --> 01:16:05.796
<i>A parasite is anything that latches
onto you or your partner...</i>

01:16:05.975 --> 01:16:08.307
<i>...and sucks the life
out of your marriage.</i>

01:16:08.477 --> 01:16:11.378
<i>They're usually in the form
of addictions like gambling...</i>

01:16:11.547 --> 01:16:13.242
<i>...drugs or pornography.</i>

01:16:13.415 --> 01:16:16.145
<i>They promise pleasure,
but they grow like a disease...</i>

01:16:16.318 --> 01:16:19.446
<i>...and consume more and more
of your thoughts, time and money.</i>

01:16:19.622 --> 01:16:23.922
<i>They steal away your loyalty
and heart from those you love.</i>

01:16:24.093 --> 01:16:26.960
<i>Marriages rarely survive
if parasites are present.</i>

01:16:27.129 --> 01:16:28.562
<i>If you love your wife...</i>

01:16:28.731 --> 01:16:32.565
<i>...you must destroy any addiction
that has your heart.</i>

01:16:32.735 --> 01:16:36.296
<i>If you don't, it will destroy you.</i>

01:17:00.963 --> 01:17:04.592
Okay, Lord. No more addictions.

01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:23.107
Mr. Rudolph.

01:17:24.653 --> 01:17:26.587
Caleb.

01:17:28.824 --> 01:17:30.257
You doing okay today?

01:17:30.759 --> 01:17:32.989
No, not really.

01:17:49.445 --> 01:17:53.313
Irma, I don't want you
talking to that guy.

01:17:53.482 --> 01:17:55.882
He is weird.

01:17:56.819 --> 01:17:59.686
Takes one to know one.

01:19:40.389 --> 01:19:42.084
What?

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:56.737
No.

01:19:57.506 --> 01:19:58.837
No.

01:20:37.779 --> 01:20:39.770
- Good morning.
- Hi, Mrs. Evans, how are you?

01:20:39.948 --> 01:20:41.711
I'm fine. I hope you are.

01:20:41.884 --> 01:20:43.146
I'm doing pretty good.

01:20:43.318 --> 01:20:46.947
I actually wanted to talk to you about
the equipment we've been looking at.

01:20:47.122 --> 01:20:50.580
I bet your parents are excited. When
a patient gets the right wheelchair...

01:20:50.759 --> 01:20:52.624
...it can make such a difference.

01:20:53.295 --> 01:20:54.455
I'm sorry, what?

01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:58.031
The bed and wheelchair we delivered
to your parents this morning.

01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:00.493
To my parents?

01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:03.069
Yes, they should have been delivered
by now.

01:21:03.972 --> 01:21:05.872
But I haven't paid for anything yet.

01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:08.066
Oh, it's actually
already been paid for.

01:21:08.644 --> 01:21:10.908
A gentleman called,
said that he wanted to pay...

01:21:11.079 --> 01:21:12.910
...for everything
that you'd picked out.

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:16.915
Actually, he covered everything
plus some accessories.

01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:18.677
He said...

01:21:20.022 --> 01:21:21.489
Mrs. Holt?

01:21:40.809 --> 01:21:44.609
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Oh, she looks amazing.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.941
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

01:22:06.435 --> 01:22:09.495
Has anyone ever told you
that you're wonderful?

01:22:10.072 --> 01:22:12.040
Maybe, but not today.

01:22:12.674 --> 01:22:14.938
Gavin, you didn't have to do that.

01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:18.102
- Do what?
- Giving money to help my parents.

01:22:19.214 --> 01:22:20.579
That was so thoughtful.

01:22:22.117 --> 01:22:23.607
Thank you.

01:22:24.052 --> 01:22:25.314
You're welcome.

01:22:25.721 --> 01:22:27.814
It was the least I could do.

01:22:31.426 --> 01:22:34.395
- Do you have lunch plans?
- I do now.

01:22:57.753 --> 01:22:58.947
"Dear Catherine.

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:02.323
I can't tell you how much
I've enjoyed getting to know you.

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:06.521
I find myself
thinking about you often...

01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:09.858
...and I look forward
to seeing you every day.

01:23:10.666 --> 01:23:12.327
Gavin. "

01:23:17.005 --> 01:23:20.964
Yeah, I need to know if there's a Gavin
that works at the hospital.

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:24.644
No, I just have a first name.

01:23:42.631 --> 01:23:44.030
Dr. Keller?

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.334
- Yes?
- Caleb Holt.

01:23:47.502 --> 01:23:49.629
I need a word with you, please.

01:23:49.805 --> 01:23:52.467
It's really not a good time.
I'm about to make my rounds.

01:23:52.641 --> 01:23:54.768
I think you need to make time.

01:23:55.243 --> 01:23:58.371
This is concerning Catherine,
my wife.

01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:03.379
All right, what can I do for you?

01:24:04.853 --> 01:24:06.946
I know what you're doing.

01:24:07.389 --> 01:24:10.825
I have no intention of stepping aside
as you try to steal my wife's heart.

01:24:11.793 --> 01:24:15.320
I've made some mistakes,
but I still love her.

01:24:15.697 --> 01:24:18.632
So just know
I am going after her too.

01:24:20.001 --> 01:24:24.301
And since I'm married to her,
I'd say I've got a head start.

01:24:26.908 --> 01:24:30.867
By the way,
thanks for helping me with my hand.

01:24:31.179 --> 01:24:33.943
My ring finger's feeling
a whole lot better.

01:25:06.548 --> 01:25:09.847
Y'all, I just saw Caleb and Dr. Keller
going at each other.

01:25:10.018 --> 01:25:12.680
He had his fist
all knuckled in his face.

01:25:12.854 --> 01:25:14.788
Are you serious?

01:25:16.324 --> 01:25:18.315
What are you all talking about?

01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:20.859
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

01:25:21.029 --> 01:25:24.089
I'm fine.
You sure got quiet really fast.

01:25:24.266 --> 01:25:26.461
Well, that's because
we decided to stop talking.

01:25:26.635 --> 01:25:28.068
What's up?

01:25:28.236 --> 01:25:30.500
I'm setting up an interview
in about 10 minutes...

01:25:30.672 --> 01:25:34.438
...but I was wondering if you guys
have seen Dr. Keller this morning.

01:25:34.609 --> 01:25:37.134
I think he was doing rounds,
maybe on the 8th Floor.

01:25:37.312 --> 01:25:39.974
Okay, well, I'll see y'all later.

01:25:40.148 --> 01:25:41.911
See you.

01:25:43.084 --> 01:25:44.881
Why didn't you tell her?

01:25:45.053 --> 01:25:47.647
- Because it ain't our business.
- But you told all of us.

01:25:47.823 --> 01:25:52.123
I don't want her to know her business
is our business if it ain't our business.

01:25:55.964 --> 01:25:57.488
<i>Hi.</i>

01:25:57.999 --> 01:26:00.524
Hey, how are you?

01:26:00.702 --> 01:26:04.035
- Hey, Catherine.
- How's the good doctor today?

01:26:04.206 --> 01:26:07.937
- Pretty busy, actually.
- Are we still on for lunch?

01:26:08.243 --> 01:26:10.677
You know, there's a few things
I need to catch up on.

01:26:10.846 --> 01:26:13.610
- I've gotten a little behind lately.
- Okay.

01:26:13.782 --> 01:26:16.717
- Well, maybe we could talk later.
- That'd be good.

01:26:16.885 --> 01:26:20.116
- All right, see you around.
- See you.

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:34.700
- Hello, Catherine.
- Oh, hi, Anna. How are you?

01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:37.065
I'm doing well. And you?

01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:39.639
I'm okay, I guess.
Do you wanna sit down?

01:26:39.808 --> 01:26:41.571
I'd love to if I'm not disturbing you.

01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:43.370
Not at all.

01:26:45.113 --> 01:26:47.911
So, what's been going on
in your life these days?

01:26:48.083 --> 01:26:50.347
We haven't talked in a while.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:54.518
Well, it's been one of those years.

01:26:55.323 --> 01:26:57.154
Good or bad?

01:26:57.926 --> 01:27:01.862
You know, I hate to say it,
but mostly bad.

01:27:04.099 --> 01:27:06.192
You know when you get
to a fork in the road...

01:27:06.368 --> 01:27:09.360
...and you know that either way you go
is gonna change your life?

01:27:09.838 --> 01:27:13.934
Life does give you some of those.
Excuse me just a minute.

01:27:20.215 --> 01:27:22.410
So have you decided
which path to take?

01:27:25.086 --> 01:27:26.815
I think so.

01:27:26.988 --> 01:27:29.422
It's just hard
not to second-guess yourself.

01:27:31.226 --> 01:27:36.425
Pardon me, I don't mean to pry,
but does this concern relationships?

01:27:38.733 --> 01:27:39.791
It does.

01:27:40.435 --> 01:27:43.063
Catherine, you're so young.

01:27:43.238 --> 01:27:46.230
I would encourage you
to make your choices carefully.

01:27:46.775 --> 01:27:48.970
I'm trying to.

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:53.748
But I'm also tired of feeling empty.

01:27:55.183 --> 01:27:57.674
Anna, it's so nice
to have someone treat you...

01:27:57.852 --> 01:28:00.116
...like they really care about you.

01:28:00.288 --> 01:28:04.987
Forgive me, but you're talking about
a certain young doctor, aren't you?

01:28:06.328 --> 01:28:09.058
I suppose it's no secret
as much as he and I talk.

01:28:09.798 --> 01:28:13.393
I couldn't help but notice
how you act around each other.

01:28:13.568 --> 01:28:17.334
But I also wonder
how your husband would feel.

01:28:21.509 --> 01:28:23.875
My husband has had his chance.

01:28:24.045 --> 01:28:26.206
And Dr. Keller is a good man.

01:28:26.381 --> 01:28:29.839
He treats me better than my husband
has treated me in years.

01:28:30.018 --> 01:28:33.249
He listens to me
and makes me feel important.

01:28:33.421 --> 01:28:36.288
I haven't felt that way
in a very long time.

01:28:36.992 --> 01:28:39.756
It's always good to have that, but...

01:28:39.928 --> 01:28:45.230
But, sweetheart, if this doctor is trying
to woo you while you're still married...

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.427
...what makes you think
he won't do that with someone else?

01:28:50.105 --> 01:28:52.938
I don't wanna talk about this, Anna.
We're getting personal.

01:28:53.108 --> 01:28:54.973
Oh, Catherine, I'm sorry.

01:28:55.143 --> 01:28:57.008
I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds.

01:28:57.178 --> 01:28:59.510
I need to go.
It's good to see you, Anna.

01:32:47.609 --> 01:32:49.873
Catherine, are you okay?

01:32:51.813 --> 01:32:53.246
I'm fine.

01:32:53.748 --> 01:32:56.683
- Aren't you going to work?
- No.

01:33:03.024 --> 01:33:06.050
- Are you sick?
- I'll be fine.

01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:10.591
Is it your allergies?

01:33:11.666 --> 01:33:14.635
I said I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.

01:33:15.503 --> 01:33:18.438
Because if you need something,
I can go to the store.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.538
No, I'm okay. You can go.

01:33:25.713 --> 01:33:27.203
Okay.

01:33:55.944 --> 01:33:57.104
Can you sit up for me?

01:34:09.424 --> 01:34:10.448
You got a fever.

01:34:39.153 --> 01:34:40.586
Here.

01:34:41.255 --> 01:34:43.519
You think you can take this?

01:35:00.108 --> 01:35:01.575
Why are you doing this?

01:35:04.145 --> 01:35:08.377
I have learned
you never leave your partner.

01:35:08.649 --> 01:35:10.480
Especially in a fire.

01:35:14.122 --> 01:35:16.317
Caleb, what's happened to you?

01:35:20.895 --> 01:35:22.863
Dad asked me
if there was anything in me...

01:35:23.031 --> 01:35:24.896
...that wanted to save our marriage.

01:35:27.835 --> 01:35:29.894
And then he gave me something.

01:35:32.607 --> 01:35:33.733
I could let you read it.

01:35:41.716 --> 01:35:43.047
Was it this?

01:35:45.186 --> 01:35:47.154
How long have you known?

01:35:47.989 --> 01:35:50.082
I found it yesterday.

01:35:51.426 --> 01:35:53.018
So, what day are you on?

01:35:54.362 --> 01:35:56.091
Forty-three.

01:35:57.131 --> 01:35:58.792
There's only 40.

01:36:01.769 --> 01:36:03.930
Who says I have to stop?

01:36:12.046 --> 01:36:13.673
Caleb...

01:36:14.549 --> 01:36:16.540
...I don't know how to process this.

01:36:18.853 --> 01:36:20.878
This is not normal for you.

01:36:23.291 --> 01:36:25.418
Welcome to the new normal.

01:36:31.566 --> 01:36:34.262
You didn't wanna do this at first,
did you?

01:36:37.271 --> 01:36:38.636
No.

01:36:40.775 --> 01:36:42.936
But halfway through, I realized...

01:36:43.111 --> 01:36:46.410
...that I did not understand
what love was.

01:36:47.682 --> 01:36:52.745
And once I understood that,
I wanted to do it.

01:36:53.721 --> 01:36:57.919
Caleb, I want to believe
that this is real.

01:36:59.327 --> 01:37:02.785
But I am not ready
to say that I trust you again.

01:37:04.899 --> 01:37:06.730
I understand that.

01:37:10.271 --> 01:37:13.331
But whether you ever reach
that point or not...

01:37:14.876 --> 01:37:17.777
...I need you
to understand something.

01:37:38.299 --> 01:37:40.028
I am sorry.

01:37:48.209 --> 01:37:50.074
I have been so selfish.

01:37:55.116 --> 01:37:59.018
For the past seven years,
I have trampled on you...

01:37:59.187 --> 01:38:02.179
...with my words
and with my actions.

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:10.822
I have loved other things
when I should have loved you.

01:38:16.704 --> 01:38:18.934
In the last few weeks...

01:38:19.774 --> 01:38:25.144
...God has given me a love for you
that I had never had before.

01:38:26.847 --> 01:38:29.338
And I have asked him to forgive me.

01:38:31.252 --> 01:38:36.315
And I am hoping, I am praying...

01:38:38.192 --> 01:38:41.525
...that somehow
you would be able to forgive me too.

01:38:48.202 --> 01:38:53.606
Catherine, I do not want to live
the rest of my life without you.

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.011
I'm supposed to give
those divorce papers...

01:39:08.189 --> 01:39:10.157
...to my lawyer next week.

01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:14.087
I just...

01:39:17.965 --> 01:39:19.990
I need some time...

01:39:21.035 --> 01:39:22.400
...to think.

01:39:26.674 --> 01:39:29.234
You can have all the time you need.

01:40:01.776 --> 01:40:04.540
- Hello, Mrs. Holt, how are you today?
- Fine, thanks.

01:40:04.712 --> 01:40:06.612
I hope your parents are doing well.

01:40:06.781 --> 01:40:09.113
That new bed and wheelchair
are certainly helping.

01:40:09.283 --> 01:40:11.979
I'm so glad.
Well, what can I do for you today?

01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:15.856
I just need to pick up a few linens
for the hospital bed for my mom.

01:40:16.023 --> 01:40:17.820
Sure, we have some in stock.

01:40:17.992 --> 01:40:20.984
Great, that's the only thing
that wasn't covered by the doctor...

01:40:21.162 --> 01:40:23.221
...when he purchased
that bed and wheelchair.

01:40:23.397 --> 01:40:24.659
The doctor?

01:40:24.832 --> 01:40:28.529
Yes, Dr. Keller,
our secret philanthropist.

01:40:29.603 --> 01:40:32.333
I don't think Dr. Keller
covered those things.

01:40:32.506 --> 01:40:34.667
No, I'm sure he did.
I spoke with him about it.

01:40:35.743 --> 01:40:41.375
Mrs. Holt, if I remember correctly,
$24,300 was given...

01:40:41.549 --> 01:40:45.485
...for the bed and wheelchair,
but Dr. Keller was not the main giver.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.612
What?

01:40:47.788 --> 01:40:51.189
Of the amount given,
Dr. Keller gave $300.

01:40:55.329 --> 01:40:56.887
Then who gave the other?

01:40:57.998 --> 01:41:00.364
Your husband, Caleb.

01:41:01.969 --> 01:41:05.166
He came in about two weeks ago
and paid for everything.

01:41:05.339 --> 01:41:07.068
I assumed you knew.

01:41:08.976 --> 01:41:10.136
Two weeks ago?

01:41:10.311 --> 01:41:15.578
Yes, he told me not to tell anyone,
but I didn't think that included you.

01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:18.114
It was the Tuesday before last.

01:41:18.285 --> 01:41:19.946
He called
and asked what the price...

01:41:20.121 --> 01:41:22.146
...of a particular bed
and wheelchair were.

01:41:22.323 --> 01:41:23.517
And I looked it up and...

01:41:45.813 --> 01:41:47.678
Oh, where is it?

01:42:45.973 --> 01:42:47.998
Oh, stop crying.

01:42:55.783 --> 01:42:58.581
Okay, explain RECEO.

01:42:59.453 --> 01:43:00.477
He ain't gonna get it.

01:43:00.654 --> 01:43:06.149
Rescue, exposure,
containment, extinguish...

01:43:06.327 --> 01:43:08.488
Captain, can I see you for a minute?

01:43:09.129 --> 01:43:11.563
- Right now?
- Yes, sir.

01:43:16.570 --> 01:43:18.265
Something wrong?

01:43:18.706 --> 01:43:20.697
Catherine is in the bay.

01:43:21.775 --> 01:43:24.209
- My Catherine?
- Yes, sir.

01:43:45.266 --> 01:43:46.358
Catherine?

01:43:51.939 --> 01:43:54.464
If I haven't told you...

01:43:55.976 --> 01:43:58.444
...that you are a good man...

01:43:59.647 --> 01:44:00.875
...you are.

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:08.716
And if I haven't told you...

01:44:09.557 --> 01:44:12.025
...that I've forgiven you...

01:44:12.493 --> 01:44:14.188
...I have.

01:44:24.405 --> 01:44:26.100
And if I haven't told you...

01:44:27.408 --> 01:44:29.808
...that I love you...

01:44:30.344 --> 01:44:31.538
...I do.

01:44:35.549 --> 01:44:39.007
Something has changed in you,
Caleb.

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:43.451
And I want what happened to you
to happen to me.

01:44:49.663 --> 01:44:51.426
It can.

01:44:53.167 --> 01:44:59.003
Is it too late to ask you
to grow old with me?

01:45:16.657 --> 01:45:18.284
- Yes.
- Hey, what are you looking at?

01:45:18.459 --> 01:45:20.324
Back up.
There ain't nothing to see here.

01:45:20.494 --> 01:45:21.518
Why? What's going on?

01:45:21.695 --> 01:45:23.959
Go back to your business.
Caleb's starting a fire.

01:45:24.131 --> 01:45:26.395
- Why's he starting a...?
- Ain't that kind of fire.

01:45:26.567 --> 01:45:28.194
Go back to your business. Go... Hey.

01:45:28.369 --> 01:45:30.462
Put you on cleanup duty.

01:46:34.635 --> 01:46:37.069
Good morning,
Mr. And Mrs. Rudolph.

01:46:37.705 --> 01:46:39.332
Caleb.

01:46:43.877 --> 01:46:46.573
I don't understand that boy.

01:46:51.819 --> 01:46:54.947
- How are you?
- Hi, son.

01:47:00.828 --> 01:47:03.490
I'm getting to where I know this trail
pretty well.

01:47:04.164 --> 01:47:07.463
- You're welcome to walk it anytime.
- I just might.

01:47:08.936 --> 01:47:10.927
I wanna thank you, Dad.

01:47:11.739 --> 01:47:14.105
The love darRepoe changed my life.

01:47:14.274 --> 01:47:16.037
God changed your life.

01:47:16.210 --> 01:47:19.008
The love dare
was just a tool he used.

01:47:19.747 --> 01:47:21.715
I've already given it
to one of my firemen.

01:47:21.882 --> 01:47:24.908
Good. It's meant to be passed on.

01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:30.647
I just can't tell you how grateful I am
that you didn't give up on me, Dad.

01:47:31.792 --> 01:47:34.124
Or on Mom, for that matter.

01:47:38.165 --> 01:47:42.465
Caleb, I wanna be a godly man.

01:47:43.203 --> 01:47:45.671
And I'm learning so much.

01:47:46.807 --> 01:47:48.672
But there's something
I haven't told you.

01:47:51.678 --> 01:47:54.704
I wrote that notebook
in my own handwriting...

01:47:55.048 --> 01:47:57.573
...because I knew
you would accept it from me.

01:47:58.986 --> 01:48:01.750
But I didn't do the love dare
on your mom.

01:48:01.922 --> 01:48:03.947
She did it to me.

01:48:06.794 --> 01:48:08.227
What?

01:48:08.395 --> 01:48:10.022
Son...

01:48:10.664 --> 01:48:12.598
...I was the one
that wanted to leave.

01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:15.600
But God got ahold of your mother...

01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:21.134
...and she prayed and loved me
unconditionally.

01:48:22.009 --> 01:48:25.308
It was through her example
that I came to Christ.

01:48:27.915 --> 01:48:29.507
Mom did this?

01:48:30.017 --> 01:48:31.609
She's such a blessing to me.

01:48:32.219 --> 01:48:34.653
And she's grown so much.

01:48:34.988 --> 01:48:37.513
I love her with all my heart.

01:48:40.828 --> 01:48:42.489
Dad, I...

01:48:43.931 --> 01:48:46.900
I have treated her so wrong.

01:48:47.234 --> 01:48:50.795
Caleb, she deserves your respect.

01:49:18.966 --> 01:49:21.594
Mom. Mom, I'm so sorry.

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:26.205
Mom, I didn't know. I didn't know.

01:49:26.373 --> 01:49:29.536
It's all right, son.
It's okay. It's all right.

01:49:32.846 --> 01:49:34.837
Mom, please forgive me.

01:49:35.015 --> 01:49:37.108
I do, Caleb. You're forgiven.

01:49:37.284 --> 01:49:39.411
I love you.

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.345
I love you too, Mom.

01:49:42.522 --> 01:49:44.683
I love you so much.

01:49:47.461 --> 01:49:49.929
I love you, Caleb.

01:49:59.039 --> 01:50:02.099
We've gathered here today
to celebrate the reaffirmation of vows...

01:50:02.276 --> 01:50:03.573
...with Caleb and Catherine.

01:50:03.744 --> 01:50:07.111
This may be the second time they've
made a commitment to this marriage...

01:50:07.281 --> 01:50:12.082
...it is the first time they've done so on
a foundation of faith in Jesus Christ.

01:50:12.252 --> 01:50:14.220
"It is the desire
of Caleb and Catherine...

01:50:14.421 --> 01:50:16.981
...to establish their vows
from this point on...

01:50:17.157 --> 01:50:19.853
...as a covenant and not a contract.

01:50:20.027 --> 01:50:23.121
For marriage is a sacred institution
established by God...

01:50:23.297 --> 01:50:26.460
...and one that is meant to last
for life. "

01:50:30.804 --> 01:50:34.137
"Caleb, in the presence of God
and these witnesses...

01:50:34.308 --> 01:50:37.539
...do you come today
to freely and unconditionally commit...

01:50:37.711 --> 01:50:40.236
...to this covenant marriage
to Catherine?"

01:50:40.881 --> 01:50:42.405
I do.

01:50:42.983 --> 01:50:47.511
"And, Catherine, do you come today
to freely and unconditionally commit...

01:50:47.688 --> 01:50:50.213
...to this covenant marriage
to Caleb?"

01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:51.948
I do.

01:50:52.125 --> 01:50:53.183
With all my heart.

01:50:54.428 --> 01:50:55.918
<i>Genesis 2:24 says:</i>

01:50:56.096 --> 01:50:58.997
For this reason, a man shall leave
his father and mother...

01:50:59.166 --> 01:51:04.194
...and shall be joined to his wife,
and the two shall become one flesh.
