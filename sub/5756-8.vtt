WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:03.769
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:03.771 --> 00:04.937
I GOT YOU GUYS SOMETHING.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.972
( giggling )

00:06.974 --> 00:09.174
WE'LL BE FRIENDS FOREVER.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.776
YOU LOST A DEAR FRIEND.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.345
YOU GUYS NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO SAY GOODBYE TOGETHER.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.814
OKAY, SO THE TOWN IS GONNA
PUT IN A NEW BENCH,

00:15.816 --> 00:17.983
AND THERE'S GONNA BE
A PATHWAY OF ART TILES.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.019
SHE LIVES IN THIS TOWN.
I HAVE TO SEE HER...

00:20.021 --> 00:22.287
YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA
WORK THIS OUT?

00:22.289 --> 00:24.356
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.991
Ella: ARE YOU MOVING OUT?

00:25.993 --> 00:27.793
I WAS LOOKING
FOR MR. FITZ.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.329
HE'S NOT IN.
I'M HIS SUB, MISS SHEPARD.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.664
DO YOU KNOW IF MR. FITZ
WILL BE BACK TOMORROW?

00:32.666 --> 00:33.499
I DON'T.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.668
SO YOU'VE GOT
SOME GENIUS PLAN

00:36.670 --> 00:39.004
OF SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND!

00:39.006 --> 00:40.172
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.408
WE'VE ALL GOT SECRETS,
EMILY.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.712
Aria: TOBY AND JENNA
HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.647
Spencer:
WAY BEYOND STEPSIBLINGS.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.549
IT'S ENOUGH
TO WANT HER DEAD.
AND US.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.019
( siren wails )

00:54.021 --> 00:55.320
Hanna:
SO, IS TOBY DEAD?

00:55.322 --> 00:57.489
Emily: I COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO ASK.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.159
Jenna: I'VE KEPT QUIET
ABOUT A LOT, EMILY.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.161
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS GET ME THAT FILE.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.495
OH!

01:03.497 --> 01:04.596
THERE! IT'S DONE,
OKAY?

01:11.639 --> 01:14.373
I WAS AFRAID SHE WOULDN'T
GET IT DONE IN TIME
FOR THE MEMORIAL.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.942
AND THIS WAS SOMEONE
FROM YOUR MOM'S GALLERY?

01:16.944 --> 01:18.010
RIGHT.

01:18.012 --> 01:19.711
WHERE IS YOUR MOM?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.613
THERE'S AN APARTMENT
ABOVE THE GALLERY,

01:21.615 --> 01:22.581
SO SHE'S STAYING THERE.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.916
FOR NOW.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.117
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD,
ISN'T IT?

01:25.119 --> 01:26.385
YOUR MOM MOVING OUT.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.120
YEAH, LIKE MY DAD
SHOULD HAVE LEFT.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.788
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D EXPECT.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.056
ARIA.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.225
Aria: ( sighs )
HEY, I'M SORRY.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.194
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.463
THE WHOLE THING JUST...
SUCKS.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.064
I KNOW.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.066
DID ANYONE
CALL SHELLY LEONARD?

01:41.068 --> 01:43.068
DONE. AND I TOLD HER IF
SHE PLAYS ANYTHING DEPRESSING,

01:43.070 --> 01:45.904
I WILL KICK IN HER CELLO.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.674
OH, WHAT ABOUT THE PROGRAM?
ALMOST DONE,
BUT WE SHOULD FINISH IT...

01:48.676 --> 01:51.443
...BEFORE ALI'S BROTHER
GETS HERE.
WHEN IS THAT?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.645
TONIGHT. AND HE WANTS
TO SEE US IN THE MORNING.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.448
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I BARELY REMEMBER JASON.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.785
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.
HE WAS JUST ALI'S OLDER
BROTHER DOWN THE HALL.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.487
BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.623
WITH HIS HARDCORE PUNK MUSIC
VIBRATING THE FLOORBOARDS.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.292
HOW DID HE GET INTO
AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL?

02:07.294 --> 02:09.261
I DON'T KNOW.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

02:09.263 --> 02:10.896
FOR GOTHS AND EMOS.

02:14.401 --> 02:17.136
WOW.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

02:17.138 --> 02:20.506
PEDESTAL'S ALREADY OUT THERE,
NEXT TO THE BENCH.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.708
THIS GOES UP FRIDAY MORNING.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.977
DO YOU THINK
JASON WILL LIKE IT?

02:24.979 --> 02:28.313
OF COURSE HE'LL LIKE IT.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.948
AND... YEARS FROM NOW,

02:29.950 --> 02:32.784
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
SEE THIS MEMORIAL,

02:32.786 --> 02:36.288
AND-- AND THAT'S ALL
THEY'LL EVER KNOW
ABOUT ALI.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.658
SHE'LL BE THE GIRL
THAT THEY DEDICATED
THE BENCH TO.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.460
AND WE'LL ALL BE GONE,
BUT...

02:41.462 --> 02:43.629
ALI WILL
STILL BE REMEMBERED.

02:43.631 --> 02:47.666
THAT'S IMMORTALITY,
MY DARLINGS.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.302
( laughter and chatter )
Girl: THEY'RE DONE.

02:50.304 --> 02:54.173
THEY'RE DONE.
<i> CIAO,</i> BABY.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.974
I WISH
WE COULD JUST CHOOSE

02:55.976 --> 02:59.077
THE AGE THAT WE
WANTED TO BE AND...

02:59.079 --> 03:00.913
JUST STAY THERE.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.682
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO DIE YOUNG,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.717
LEAVE A BEAUTIFUL CORPSE.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.019
DON'T JOKE.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.353
IT'S NOT A JOKE.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.655
OH, COME ON.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.023
HAVEN'T YOU GUYS EVER THOUGHT

03:11.025 --> 03:12.524
ABOUT HOW DELICIOUSLY
TRAGIC IT WOULD BE

03:12.526 --> 03:15.527
TO DIE IN SOME INCREDIBLY
MYSTERIOUS WAY?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.863
THAT WOULD BE SUPERIOR.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.032
IS THAT<i> REALLY</i>
HOW YOU WANT TO GO,
ALISON?

03:20.034 --> 03:21.867
NOT JUST YET.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.202
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.404
IT'S GRUESOME.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.906
IT'S NOT GRUESOME.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.408
IT'S IMMORTALITY,
MY DARLINGS.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.081
WHERE DID SHE GET
THAT FROM? A MOVIE?

03:36.083 --> 03:37.816
ALI<i> WAS</i> A MOVIE.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.888
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

03:42.890 --> 03:44.356
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

03:44.358 --> 03:46.358
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

03:46.360 --> 03:48.894
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

03:48.896 --> 03:51.563
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

03:51.565 --> 03:53.599
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

03:53.601 --> 03:56.134
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

03:56.136 --> 03:58.804
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

03:58.806 --> 04:00.706
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

04:03.544 --> 04:05.244
MOM, I WAS<i> SO</i> EMBARRASSED!

04:05.246 --> 04:07.679
SO THEY CAN JUST
TAKE MY CREDIT CARD?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.548
THAT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY,
ISN'T IT?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.817
IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY.
IT BELONGS TO THE BANK.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.785
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
MY OTHER CARDS?

04:13.787 --> 04:16.121
DON'T BE SO
QUICK ON THE DRAW,

04:16.123 --> 04:17.789
AT LEAST FOR A WHILE.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.258
I'M SORRY.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.526
I WAS TRYING TO KEEP THIS
OFF YOUR RADAR.
MOM.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.996
WE HAVE TO MAKE
SOME ADJUSTMENTS.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.831
TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENTS.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.799
WE NEED TO BE
MORE CAREFUL ABOUT MONEY.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.502
FOR HOW LONG?
UNTIL WE DON'T
HAVE TO ANYMORE.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.037
AND HOW LONG IS THAT?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.505
I DON'T KNOW.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.606
WELL, WHEN<i> WILL</i> YOU KNOW?

04:37.344 --> 04:40.545
THIS IS A VISUAL
REPRESENTATION OF
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

04:40.547 --> 04:44.416
SKIM MILK, ORANGE JUICE,
AND SOME YOGURT.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.719
NO FLAVORED WATERS,
NO CUNNING CHARDONNAY.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.555
NOTHING FROM
THE ARTISAN CHEESE SHOP.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.491
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.995
WHAT HAPPENED
IS A MORTGAGE,

04:56.997 --> 04:59.998
AND BILLS, AND TAXES,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.167
AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS
A ONE-PAYCHECK FAMILY,

05:02.169 --> 05:04.336
AND WE CAN'T LIVE
A TWO-PAYCHECK LIFE.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.877
I THOUGHT I COULD COMPENSATE
FOR YOUR DAD GOING,

05:11.879 --> 05:13.111
BUT IT'S BEEN HARD.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.816
HARDER THAN I EXPECTED.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.251
HOW HARD?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.455
IT'S NOT THE FIRST CARD
TO BE DECLINED.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.060
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.561
REALLY.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.064
MOM AND DAD AND I
ARE<i> REALLY</i> GRATEFUL.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.100
THERE SHE IS!

05:37.738 --> 05:39.571
JASON!

05:39.573 --> 05:40.939
UH...

05:40.941 --> 05:42.140
HEY.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.476
SORRY I'M LATE.
NO PROBLEM.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.012
I WAS JUST SAYING
YOU'VE DONE SOME
LOVELY WORK ON THE MEMORIAL.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.214
I MIGHT HAVE DONE ONE
OR TWO THINGS DIFFERENTLY,

05:49.216 --> 05:50.816
BUT WE CAN ADJUST THAT
ALONG THE WAY.

05:50.818 --> 05:55.220
HERE'S A COPY OF THE PROGRAM
FOR THE DEDICATION.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.589
I E-MAILED YOU THE PROGRAM
THAT WE WORKED UP.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.625
RIGHT. I SAW THE DRAFT.
THIS JUST FINE-TUNES IT.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.194
UH, LET'S SEE...

06:02.196 --> 06:04.296
IF SHELLY LEONARD'S
GONNA PLAY SOMETHING,

06:04.298 --> 06:06.798
I DON'T THINK WE CAN
GIVE HER MORE THAN
THREE MINUTES.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.634
I REMEMBER SHE'S
SOMEWHAT OF A SHOWBOAT
WITH THAT CELLO.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.304
THEN, UH...

06:12.306 --> 06:14.139
OH.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.807
IS THIS...

06:15.809 --> 06:17.542
THE PICTURE
FOR THE PROGRAM?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.778
YES. IT'S
EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.950
IT'S THE ONE
I WOULD HAVE PICKED.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.787
I THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA BE ABLE

06:28.789 --> 06:31.156
TO GET MY WHOLE FAMILY
OUT HERE, BUT...

06:31.158 --> 06:33.125
YOU KNOW,
AT THE LAST MINUTE,

06:33.127 --> 06:35.494
MY MOM, UM...

06:35.496 --> 06:37.129
( chuckles )

06:37.131 --> 06:39.064
IT'S CRAZY TALKING
ABOUT THIS, ISN'T IT?

06:40.934 --> 06:44.002
WHEN I THINK ABOUT HER,
I-I THINK ABOUT YOU--

06:44.004 --> 06:47.339
THE FIVE OF YOU,
IN HER BEDROOM, LAUGHING,

06:47.341 --> 06:48.707
KEEPING SECRETS.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.310
LONG TIME AGO.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.015
I WANT EACH OF YOU TO SPEAK.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.884
I'D RATHER HEAR FROM YOU

06:58.886 --> 07:01.186
THAN MRS. SLOCOMB
FROM THE PTA.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.588
THE PTA WAS A LOT OF HELP.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.258
WHAT ABOUT THE RAIN?
THE RAIN?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.226
FORTY PERCENT CHANCE
BEFORE THE WEEKEND.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.695
OH, UM, THEY SAID
THAT WE CAN USE

07:10.697 --> 07:12.197
THE SCHOOL'S
MULTIPURPOSE ROOM

07:12.199 --> 07:13.698
IF WE HAVE TO MOVE
THE CEREMONY INSIDE.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.067
GREAT.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.437
PEOPLE THINK THIS DEDICATION
IS ABOUT CLOSURE.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.442
THERE WON'T BE CLOSURE
UNTIL THEY FIND OUT

07:23.444 --> 07:26.878
WHO DID THIS TO ALISON.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.281
THE COPS IN THIS TOWN HAVE BEEN
JERKING MY FAMILY AROUND

07:29.283 --> 07:31.416
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.385
NO MORE OF THAT.

07:33.387 --> 07:34.853
I'M HERE TO GET SOME ACTION,

07:34.855 --> 07:37.289
AND THIS MEMORIAL
IS GONNA HELP ME GET IT.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.225
OH, AND I'M ADDING...

07:40.227 --> 07:42.394
ONE SPEAKER TO THE PROGRAM.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.131
JENNA MARSHALL?

07:48.535 --> 07:50.902
YOU WANT JENNA TO SPEAK
AT THE DEDICATION?

07:50.904 --> 07:51.903
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:51.905 --> 07:52.904
WHY?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.739
SHE ASKED ME IF SHE COULD.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.274
JENNA ASKED TO SPEAK?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.776
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

07:57.778 --> 07:59.644
I-IT JUST
DIDN'T OCCUR TO US

07:59.646 --> 08:01.980
THAT ALISON AND JENNA
WERE<i> THAT</i> CLOSE.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.915
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.518
JENNA CALLED AND...
SAID MY SISTER WAS

08:06.520 --> 08:08.353
A LOT OF HELP TO HER
AFTER HER ACCIDENT.

08:10.724 --> 08:14.593
WELL, CONCENTRATE ON
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.861
LEAVE THE REST OF IT
TO ME.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.197
NOW, I'M...

08:19.199 --> 08:21.700
GOING TO HAVE A TALK
WITH DETECTIVE WILDEN

08:21.702 --> 08:23.602
AND FIND OUT WHY THEY
HAVEN'T LOCATED TOBY YET.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.106
DID WE JUST GET FIRED?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.207
SHH! KEEP IT DOWN!

08:29.209 --> 08:31.743
WHY IS HE TALKING TO JENNA?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.378
I DON'T KNOW.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.980
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE TO SAY?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.948
THIS IS TURNING
INTO A NIGHTMARE.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.984
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

08:38.986 --> 08:42.287
NOTHING. HE JUST
KEPT SMILING LIKE HE
WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.257
SPENCE, WHY DOES
JENNA WANT TO SPEAK
AT THE DEDICATION?

08:45.259 --> 08:47.092
WHY DOES JASON
<i> WANT</i> HER THERE?

08:47.094 --> 08:49.628
I MEAN, HE CLEARLY KNOWS
THEY WEREN'T FRIENDS.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.129
WE CAN'T LET JENNA SPEAK.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.297
WELL, HOW ARE WE
GONNA STOP HER

08:52.299 --> 08:53.965
WITHOUT LOOKING
LIKE BITCHES?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.467
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO STOP HER AT ALL?

08:55.469 --> 08:57.035
IN CASE YOU GUYS
DIDN'T NOTICE,

08:57.037 --> 08:59.137
WE JUST GOT PATTED
ON THE HEAD AND SENT OFF
TO PLAY.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.806
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU NEED TO STAY
ON TOP OF HIM.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.174
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.509
WHY ME?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.044
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE BIG ORGANIZER.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.779
YOU'VE GOT THE LAPTOP
OF ALL KNOWLEDGE,

09:07.781 --> 09:09.681
AND HE'S GONNA
NEED SOME OF THAT.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.349
JENNA COULD GET UP THERE,
SHE COULD TELL ABOUT THE FIRE

09:11.351 --> 09:12.651
AND TOBY.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.886
SHE COULD
TELL ABOUT EVERYTHING.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.891
( school bell rings )

09:30.571 --> 09:31.836
EZRA, WAIT.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.475
JUST LET ME TALK
FOR A SECOND. PLEASE.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.312
I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE
OR TRY TO CONVINCE YOU
OF ANYTHING.

09:40.314 --> 09:43.048
I KNOW IT'S OVER.
I<i> KNOW</i> THAT.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.820
BUT I JUST--
I CAN'T STAND THE IDEA

09:48.822 --> 09:51.556
OF YOU WALKING AROUND
AND HATING ME.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.224
HATE YOU?

09:53.226 --> 09:56.161
THE ONLY PERSON I HATE
RIGHT NOW IS MYSELF,

09:56.163 --> 09:57.529
FOR ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.336
I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.678
BUT THIS
IS BAND OF HORSES.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.714
NOEL GOT TICKETS
TO BAND OF HORSES?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.482
YEAH. STRICTLY VIP.

10:17.484 --> 10:20.452
AND WE GET TO GO?
YEP. YOU AND ME...
WITH NOEL.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.854
WELL, WHO'S NOEL BRINGING?
THAT'S THE THING--
HE WANTS TO ASK ARIA...

10:22.856 --> 10:25.590
BUT SHE'S GOT THIS,
LIKE, ANTI-BOY ZONE
AROUND HER.

10:25.592 --> 10:30.061
SO NOEL'S AT THIS PLACE
WHERE HE WANTS TO ASK HER,
BUT NOT IF SHE'S GONNA SAY NO.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.598
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS GET ARIA TO GO,
AND WE GET TO GO.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.133
YOU GOT IT.
PERFECT.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.068
I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.371
I HAVE TO GO DO
A YEARBOOK NOW,
BUT I WILL GRAB HER LATER.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.206
WAIT, YEARBOOK?
ARE YOU WORKING
WITH META-GEEK?

10:41.208 --> 10:43.108
IF YOU MEAN LUCAS, YES.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.877
WELL, WATCH OUT.
COOTIES ARE CONTAGIOUS.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.046
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID "COOTIES."

10:48.048 --> 10:49.180
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOBER.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.053
( laughing )
I DARE YOU.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.955
YOU'RE AWFUL.
YES, I AM. COME ON.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.066
WHAT'D YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU?

11:08.068 --> 11:10.301
I DON'T KNOW, ONE OF
THOSE<i> REALLY</i> SOUR CANDIES.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.771
NOT A CHANCE.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.739
UM, I HAD A THOUGHT--

11:14.741 --> 11:16.775
WHY DON'T WE DO
SOMETHING ONE NIGHT,

11:16.777 --> 11:18.476
INSTEAD OF
JUST HANGING OUT?

11:18.478 --> 11:20.612
WHAT KIND OF SOMETHING?

11:20.614 --> 11:24.149
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE GO FOR A REAL
DINNER SOMEPLACE,

11:24.151 --> 11:26.685
THEN GO SOMEWHERE,
LIKE... A MOVIE?

11:28.288 --> 11:31.589
DINNER AND A MOVIE.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.958
THINK THERE'S
A WORD FOR THAT.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.461
WHAT'S IT CALLED
WHEN TWO PEOPLE
GO OUT LIKE THAT?

11:36.463 --> 11:39.297
I THINK THEY CALL IT,
UM, A DATE.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.299
YEAH,
I'VE HEARD OF THAT.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.803
SO YOU'RE, UM...
ASKING ME OUT ON A DATE?

11:44.805 --> 11:47.672
TWO FRIENDS HAVING DINNER,
GOING TO THE MOVIES--

11:47.674 --> 11:49.307
NO BIG.

11:51.445 --> 11:54.245
YEAH, I'M ASKING YOU
ON A DATE.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.249
HMM.
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.151
( laughing )
HEY! MAYA!

12:03.590 --> 12:04.856
( cell phone rings )

12:07.461 --> 12:09.994
MOM?

12:09.996 --> 12:12.297
WAIT, SO PEOPLE
JUST LET YOU DO THIS?

12:12.299 --> 12:14.332
I MEAN, YOU GO
UP TO THEM AND SAY,

12:14.334 --> 12:16.101
"CAN I TAKE A PICTURE
OF YOUR LOCKER,"
AND THEY SAY YES?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.869
IF YOU TELL THEM
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THEIR LOCKER FOR THE BOOK,

12:17.871 --> 12:20.739
THEY THINK IT'S
ALL ABOUT THEM,
AND THEY OPEN RIGHT UP.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.440
GOTTA LOVE THAT HUMAN EGO.

12:22.442 --> 12:26.010
SO, I WAS THINKING
FOUR LOCKERS TO A PAGE

12:26.012 --> 12:28.346
WITH THE NAME
UNDERNEATH EACH PICTURE.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.882
NO, YOU KNOW,
DON'T PUT THE NAMES.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.150
THEY SHOULD GUESS
WHOSE LOCKER IS WHOSE.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.018
YOU CAN PUT NUMBERS
AND A LIST

12:34.020 --> 12:36.354
IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK.
BE MORE FUN.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.856
YEAH, IT WOULD.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.291
I LIKE THAT.
IT'S SMART.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.363
THIS IS IMPRESSIVE.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.232
BECAUSE YOU'RE USED
TO TAKING PICTURES

12:47.234 --> 12:48.933
BY POINTING YOUR PHONE
AT PEOPLE.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.770
I LIKE A CAMERA THAT
ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE A CAMERA.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.738
THESE AREN'T CHEAP,
ARE THEY?

12:53.740 --> 12:56.574
NO, BUT I AUCTIONED
SOME STUFF ONLINE

12:56.576 --> 12:58.076
AND GOT
A GOOD DEAL FOR IT.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.245
WELL, WHAT KIND OF STUFF
DID YOU SELL?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.247
STUFF.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.649
ACTION FIGURES?

13:04.651 --> 13:07.051
THEY WERE REALLY IMPORTANT
TO ME WHEN I WAS 12.

13:07.053 --> 13:11.990
WHO BUYS ACTION FIGURES
FROM 12-YEAR-OLD BOYS
WHO ARE TIRED OF THEM?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.691
40-YEAR-OLD MEN.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.660
AND YOU CAN
MAKE MONEY THAT WAY?

13:15.662 --> 13:18.163
ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY
THE TOYS YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN NOW.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.600
SO, ARE YOU...

13:22.602 --> 13:25.170
INTERESTED IN SELLING
SOME STUFF ONLINE?

13:25.172 --> 13:29.240
YEAH, I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW.
I WOULD.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.277
I'M SAYING,
I COULD HELP YOU MAKE
A COUPLE OF BUCKS,

13:32.279 --> 13:33.711
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.280
YEAH.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.682
I MEAN, THAT'D BE GREAT,
IF YOU COULD.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.851
JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TWO OF,

13:39.853 --> 13:42.086
AND WE'LL SELL ONE OF 'EM.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.922
JUST NO KIDNEYS, OKAY?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.090
( chuckles )

13:57.470 --> 13:58.603
EM?

14:01.274 --> 14:03.308
IT'S MY DAD.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.976
GOD, IS HE OKAY?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.477
HE'S OKAY.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.480
HE'S...
BETTER THAN OKAY.

14:09.482 --> 14:13.318
THEY'RE ROTATING HIS UNIT
OUT OF AFGHANISTAN.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.986
MY DAD'S COMING HOME.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.955
( faint chuckle )

14:46.653 --> 14:48.453
( laughter and chatter )

14:49.956 --> 14:52.357
Girl: OKAY,
GO FOR THE ANACONDA.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.026
IT'S THE SITUATION.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.828
Girl #2: THERE'S
THE SITUATION, RIGHT NOW.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.063
GOD, JENNA THE JERK
IS LOOKING AT US.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.734
IT'S A VERY SECOND-STRING
CROWD SHE'S WITH.

15:02.736 --> 15:06.104
WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST
TAKE HER "D"-LIST
GANG AND GO HOME

15:06.106 --> 15:07.972
INSTEAD OF SITTING HERE
AND CREEPING ME OUT?

15:07.974 --> 15:10.208
JENNA'S HERE.
WHERE'S TOBY?

15:10.210 --> 15:13.544
OUT IN THE WOODS,
SACRIFICING SQUIRRELS.

15:13.546 --> 15:18.516
GOD. DON'T YOU EVER
GET TIRED OF SHOOTING
AT THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT?

15:18.518 --> 15:21.152
DON'T RUIN
A PERFECT DAY, SPENCER.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.254
IT<i> IS</i> PERFECT.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.656
FRIENDS FOREVER.

15:24.658 --> 15:28.493
YEAH. EVEN WHEN
WE GET REALLY OLD.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.530
( cell phone rings )

15:34.734 --> 15:35.867
( ring )

15:50.183 --> 15:53.618
OKAY, IT IS TIME
FOR YOU TO GET BACK TO
THE LAND OF THE LIVING.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.787
YOU JUST WANT ME TO GO
SO YOU CAN GO WITH SEAN.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.288
IT'S NOT TRUE!
AND...

15:57.290 --> 15:59.290
EVEN IF IT IS
A LITTLE BIT TRUE,

15:59.292 --> 16:00.858
MORE REASON FOR YOU TO COME.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.863
I DON'T KNOW.
ARIA, WHAT'S NOT TO KNOW?

16:05.865 --> 16:08.299
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M SETTING YOU UP
WITH MY DUD COUSIN RAYMOND

16:08.301 --> 16:10.535
WHO MAKES MINIATURE
FURNITURE FOR A HOBBY.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.170
THIS IS NOEL KAHN.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.205
HE WAS YOUR BIGGEST CRUSH
ALL THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL,

16:14.207 --> 16:15.974
AND NOW
HE'S ASKING YOU OUT,

16:15.976 --> 16:19.477
SO STOP PINING
FOR THE FJORDS
AND<i> "CARPE</i> HOTTIE."

16:19.479 --> 16:22.480
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FJORDS.
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

16:22.482 --> 16:25.350
THE PROBLEM IS...

16:25.352 --> 16:27.352
I JUST CAN'T
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.053
WELL, NOW IS ALL I'VE GOT.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.989
MAYBE IN A FEW WEEKS.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.324
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST
GET OVER THE GUY
BY TOMORROW NIGHT?

16:33.326 --> 16:36.361
HANNA, LOOK, MY FAMILY
JUST BLEW UP. UNDERSTAND?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.830
WELL, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
TAKE YOUR MIND OFF OF IT.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.400
I'D<i> LOVE</i> TO GET MY MIND
OFF OF IT, BUT I CAN'T.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.037
LATER.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.372
LATER.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.249
Ali: WELL, WELL, WELL.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.851
SOMETHING NEW
HAS BEEN ADDED.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.286
NOEL KAHN
INSPECTING THE TROOPS.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.921
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
GO OUT SO SOON

17:03.923 --> 17:05.890
AFTER A BOOB JOB.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.558
LET THEM DROP DOWN TO WHERE
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

17:07.560 --> 17:09.227
BEFORE YOU TAKE 'EM OUT.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.696
PRUDENCE FINN
HAD A BOOB JOB?

17:11.698 --> 17:15.433
SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING
TO COMPENSATE FOR BEING
NAMED PRUDENCE.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.901
THINKING ABOUT IT, ARIA?

17:18.872 --> 17:21.105
THINKING ABOUT WHAT?

17:21.107 --> 17:23.408
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT
TO GET NOEL'S ATTENTION.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.942
NO.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.945
ARIA LIKES THEM BRAINY.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.847
CUTE, RICH,
AND BRAINY.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.417
YOU GET THE WHOLE PACKAGE
WITH NOEL KAHN.

17:32.419 --> 17:36.254
YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY,
I LIKE SOMEONE WITH
A LITTLE MORE MATURITY.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.122
NOT THAT NOEL
DOESN'T HAVE POTENTIAL.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.391
HE JUST LACKS
A LITTLE SEASONING.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.560
HE'S PERFECT FOR YOU,
ARIA.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.462
DON'T BE TOO COY.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.392
HELLO, HANNA.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.496
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
SAID I COULD FIND
YOU IN HERE.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.999
WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN
DO FOR YOU,

18:22.001 --> 18:23.334
BUT DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

18:23.336 --> 18:25.036
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.004
I WAS WONDERING IF EMILY
HAD HEARD ANYTHING

18:27.006 --> 18:29.073
FROM TOBY CAVANAUGH
SINCE HE WENT MISSING.

18:29.075 --> 18:32.009
DO I LOOK LIKE EMILY?
ASK HER.

18:32.011 --> 18:35.346
I THOUGHT YOU GIRLS
SHARED EVERYTHING.
WELL, YOU WERE WRONG.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.682
ALISON'S BROTHER'S IN TOWN.
YOU KNEW THAT, DIDN'T YOU?

18:37.684 --> 18:39.584
JASON. AND, YES, I KNOW.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.819
HE'S HERE
FOR THE DEDICATION
OF ALI'S MEMORIAL.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.654
OH, HE'S HERE FOR
MORE THAN THAT, HANNA.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.389
HE CAME INTO
MY OFFICE YESTERDAY.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.892
HE CAME IN TO MAKE NOISE
ABOUT HOW HE DOESN'T LIKE

18:47.894 --> 18:49.427
THE WAY THINGS
HAVE BEEN HANDLED.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.596
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S ENTITLED TO THAT.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.431
IT'S A SMALL TOWN, HANNA.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.267
SOMETIMES PRIVATE
AND PUBLIC LIVES
CAN GET A LITTLE MUDDLED.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.536
YEAH. TELL ME ABOUT IT.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.338
LOOK...

19:00.340 --> 19:02.874
I UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH ME,

19:02.876 --> 19:04.342
BUT I HOPE
YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND

19:04.344 --> 19:06.344
THAT WHATEVER YOU
TELL JASON DiLAURENTIS

19:06.346 --> 19:08.713
MIGHT END UP BEING
VERY EMBARRASSING
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.215
YOU MIGHT END UP
HURTING THE WRONG PEOPLE.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.850
YOU KNOW,
I'M A LITTLE HAZY

19:12.852 --> 19:14.852
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
"RIGHT AND WRONG" THING.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.021
ARE YOU SAYING I SHOULD
OR I SHOULDN'T TELL JASON

19:17.023 --> 19:19.624
THAT THE COP
WHO'S INVESTIGATING
HIS SISTER'S MURDER

19:19.626 --> 19:21.859
USED TO HANG AROUND
IN MY HOUSE WEARING
A TOWEL?

19:34.707 --> 19:35.740
HELLO?

19:38.044 --> 19:41.245
I-IT'S SPENCER.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.346
HELLO, SPENCER.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.250
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

19:46.252 --> 19:47.885
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.089
IT'S ABOUT THE DEDICATION.

19:52.091 --> 19:56.093
ALI'S MEMORIAL?
YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF THAT, AREN'T YOU?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.762
I WAS.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.331
NOW THAT JASON'S HERE,
HE'S TAKEN OVER.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.967
DOES JASON LOOK THE SAME?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.603
I GOT THE IMPRESSION
HE WAS DIFFERENT.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.605
HE<i> SOUNDS</i> DIFFERENT.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.140
YEAH.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.108
YEAH, HE<i> IS</i> DIFFERENT.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.476
HE'S, UH...

20:14.781 --> 20:16.814
POLISHED.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.783
POLISHED.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.785
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS
TALKING TO HIM,

20:20.787 --> 20:22.620
I GOT
THE STRANGEST SENSATION,

20:22.622 --> 20:24.789
LIKE ALI WAS
IN THE ROOM WITH US.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.027
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY
AT THE DEDICATION?

20:30.029 --> 20:32.863
I WAS GONNA
SPEAK FROM MY HEART.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.132
JENNA, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:35.134 --> 20:39.136
WHAT I WANT,
YOU CAN'T GIVE ME.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.472
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
ARE CARELESS.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.341
LIKE I TOLD EMILY,

20:43.343 --> 20:45.309
YOU'RE CARELESS
AND YOU BREAK THINGS,

20:45.311 --> 20:47.511
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.513
WE<i> ARE</i> PAYING FOR IT,
JENNA.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.649
WE'RE PAYING FOR IT
EVERY DAY.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.484
HOW MUCH?

20:53.486 --> 20:55.519
WHO'S COUNTING?

20:57.490 --> 21:00.157
( low )
Look, you want
some kind of satisfaction.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.826
I understand that.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.495
But what you can't do,
what I won't let you do,

21:04.497 --> 21:08.499
is to turn this dedication
into some kind of club
to beat up on us.

21:08.501 --> 21:13.037
Okay, we did love her,
and what happened
was terrible.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.573
She deserves this memorial,
and so do we,

21:15.575 --> 21:17.742
and you don't have
the right to turn it
into something else.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.880
ALISON WAS DONE WITH YOU.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.383
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

21:25.385 --> 21:27.718
WE TALKED ABOUT IT
IN THE HOSPITAL.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.387
SHE TOLD ME WHY.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.556
SHE SAID SHE WAS
AFRAID OF YOU.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.259
IS THAT WHY ONE OF YOU
DID WHAT YOU DID?

21:48.941 --> 21:51.242
ALL RIGHT, GOT A GUCCI,

21:51.244 --> 21:52.743
TORY BURCH.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.779
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I GOT THIS LAM.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.647
THOUGHT I HAD
SHOES TO MATCH.

21:56.649 --> 22:01.052
GOT A CHLOé
<i> AND</i> A NOTTING HILL,

22:01.054 --> 22:04.822
WHICH, I SWEAR,
WAS NOT THIS COLOR WHEN
I BOUGHT IT IN THE STORE.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.924
WHAT?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.492
YOU KNOW THE WAY
YOUR HEAD GETS

22:08.494 --> 22:10.928
WHEN I TALK
ABOUT COUNT DOOKU
AND DARTH SIDIOUS?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.396
WELL...

22:12.398 --> 22:14.498
THAT'S HOW MY HEAD
FEELS RIGHT NOW.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.267
DO YOU THINK SOMEONE
WILL BUY THESE?

22:16.269 --> 22:17.768
IT'S THE LAW
OF THE UNIVERSE.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.203
IF YOU
PUT SOMETHING ONLINE,

22:19.205 --> 22:21.472
SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE'S
WILLING TO BUY IT.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.941
I REALLY
APPRECIATE THIS, LUCAS.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.777
ZIP.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.046
SO... HOW COME
ALL OF A SUDDEN

22:29.048 --> 22:31.549
YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME MONEY?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.351
OH, UM, MY MOM CUT ME OFF.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.823
( camera shutter clicks )

22:38.825 --> 22:40.658
HAPPY I CAN HELP.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.196
CREEPAZOID ALERT.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.832
HEY, HERMIE, YOU GOT
A CAMERA ON THAT THING?

22:47.834 --> 22:50.000
MAKING<i> DAS BOOTY</i>
OR SOMETHING?

22:50.002 --> 22:52.536
( faint laughter )
NO.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.839
MY RUDDER GOT STUCK.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.006
OH. I BET IT DID.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.876
GO FRIGHTEN THE FISH.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.044
HEY!

23:01.314 --> 23:02.713
HEY WHAT?

23:06.085 --> 23:07.651
NOTHING.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.287
NEVER LOOK BACK, HANNA.

23:10.289 --> 23:11.922
SOMETHING MIGHT BE
GAINING ON YOU.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.793
( camera shutter clicks )

23:20.166 --> 23:21.632
NEXT.

23:23.503 --> 23:26.070
DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?
IT'S REASONABLY FRESH.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.738
OH, NO.
NO THANK YOU.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.240
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

23:29.242 --> 23:31.008
THAT I DIDN'T FORGET
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.244
I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY WITH CASH.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.412
CASH?

23:34.414 --> 23:36.947
YEAH. UM...
HANNA TALKED TO ARIA,

23:36.949 --> 23:40.718
AND SHE SAID THAT
I SHOULD GIVE THIS TO YOU.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.654
HANNA TALKED TO ARIA
ABOUT MONEY?

23:43.656 --> 23:46.157
YEAH. FOR THE--
FOR THE MEMORIAL.

23:46.159 --> 23:48.192
OH!

23:48.194 --> 23:50.494
THAT MONEY. OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.096
I WOULD HAVE
WRITTEN YOU A CHECK,

23:52.098 --> 23:54.231
BUT I DON'T TRUST
MY CHECKBOOK SKILLS
RIGHT NOW.

23:54.233 --> 23:57.535
THINGS ARE A LITTLE
DISTRACTED AT THE MOMENT.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.538
YEAH, HANNA SAID
YOU WERE ON YOUR OWN
OVER THERE WITH THE KIDS.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.706
YES, I AM ON MY OWN THERE.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.208
FOR NOW.

24:06.179 --> 24:08.078
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.548
UH... WELL, I DON'T
THINK I HAVE ENOUGH
INFORMATION

24:10.550 --> 24:12.550
TO GIVE YOU A SOLID
ANSWER ON THAT ONE.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.553
I UNDERSTAND.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.392
WELL, I WOULD PRY,
BUT THEN YOU WOULD
FEEL OBLIGATED

24:21.394 --> 24:23.060
TO LISTEN TO MY TALES
OF DIVORCE,

24:23.062 --> 24:24.895
WHICH I WOULDN'T WANT
TO PUT YOU THROUGH.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.398
WE DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE
GONNA BE GETTING A DIVORCE.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.401
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT,

24:30.403 --> 24:33.070
ONCE WE FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TALK AT ALL.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.939
YEAH.

24:34.941 --> 24:38.742
NOT WHERE WE THOUGHT
WE'D BE, IS IT?

24:38.744 --> 24:40.945
NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

24:40.947 --> 24:44.081
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
I'M LIVING INSIDE OF
THIS WIND TUNNEL.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.450
ALL OF THIS STUFF
IS JUST FLYING AT ME.

24:46.452 --> 24:50.888
WELL, THE WIND DIES DOWN

24:50.890 --> 24:53.390
TO A NICE, STEADY HOWL
AFTER A WHILE.

24:53.392 --> 24:56.727
WELL, DOES IT EVER
JUST STOP ALTOGETHER?

24:56.729 --> 24:58.762
I WILL LET YOU KNOW
IF IT DOES.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.097
THANKS.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.600
YOU DO THE SAME FOR ME,
OKAY, NEIGHBOR?

25:02.602 --> 25:04.602
DEAL.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.837
WELL, THAT WAS PAINLESS.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.439
NOT FOR PRINCIPAL HARTMAN.

25:08.441 --> 25:10.941
HE MEANS WELL,
BUT HE NEEDS TO KNOW
WHO'S IN CHARGE.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.444
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT.

25:13.446 --> 25:15.980
OKAY,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

25:15.982 --> 25:17.781
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.283
YOU'RE ALISON'S BROTHER.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.285
YOU SHOULD
HAVE THE FINAL SAY.

25:21.287 --> 25:24.121
BUT YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE DEALING
WITH THIS.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.690
SEE, THERE'S THAT
CLOSED DOOR AGAIN--

25:26.692 --> 25:29.994
THE SECRETS OF
THE GIRLS CUDDLED UP
IN ALISON'S BEDROOM.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.030
DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS
YOU KNEW HER BETTER
THAN I DID?

25:33.032 --> 25:36.500
NO. IT JUST
MEANS WE KNEW HER
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

25:36.502 --> 25:38.002
( footsteps approaching )

25:38.004 --> 25:39.169
RIGHT HERE.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.672
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

25:41.674 --> 25:43.674
THAT'S TOBY'S LOCKER.

25:43.676 --> 25:46.010
Wilden: THANK YOU.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.578
DETECTIVE WILDEN.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.649
YOU'LL
FIND THIS INTERESTING.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.984
WE'RE HAVING A LOOK
IN TOBY CAVANAUGH'S LOCKER.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.186
WHY? DO YOU THINK
HE'S HIDING IN THERE?

25:56.188 --> 25:57.688
HE'S A SUSPECT.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.357
WELL, YOUR INVESTIGATION
BETTER TURN UP MORE

26:00.359 --> 26:02.192
THAN TOBY CAVANAUGH'S
OLD GYM SOCKS.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.562
YOU MADE IT QUITE CLEAR
THE OTHER DAY

26:04.564 --> 26:06.864
YOU WEREN'T HAPPY WITH
THE PACE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.332
YOU SAID YOU WANTED ACTION.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.034
I'M TRYING
TO GIVE THAT TO YOU.

26:10.036 --> 26:13.237
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.
I REALIZED THAT YESTERDAY.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.873
SOMETIMES, JASON,
WE WITHHOLD INFORMATION

26:15.875 --> 26:19.543
ON THE PROGRESS
OF AN INVESTIGATION
TO AVOID ANY INTERRUPTIONS.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.379
THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE TEARING
THIS KID'S LOCKER APART

26:22.381 --> 26:24.715
IS BECAUSE
HE'S NOT AROUND TO OBJECT.

26:24.717 --> 26:28.018
TOBY CAVANAUGH CALLED
YOUR SISTER'S CELL PHONE
THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.721
I CHECKED THE PHONE RECORDS.
SHE TOOK THE CALL.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.559
TOBY CALLED ALISON
THE NIGHT SHE DIED?

26:35.561 --> 26:37.094
HE DID.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.729
OR SOMEBODY ELSE DID
USING HIS PHONE.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.757
THERE GO NOEL AND PRUDENCE
OFF TO THE KISSING ROCK.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.793
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SNEAKING OFF
TO THE KISSING ROCK FOR
HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.495
YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP.

27:11.497 --> 27:14.131
JUST BECAUSE I MAKE IT UP
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT TRUE.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.501
YOU GO THERE WITH SOMEBODY,
AND YOU CAN FEEL THE GHOSTS

27:17.503 --> 27:19.303
OF THE OTHER LOVERS
SPYING ON YOU,

27:19.305 --> 27:21.472
PUSHING YOU TO DO IT.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.374
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
NEVER DISAPPOINT A GHOST.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.511
IT'S JUST A DUSTY OLD ROCK.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.113
WHO DO YOU
WANT TO TAKE THERE?

27:42.094 --> 27:44.495
Sean: THIS CONCERT
SHOULD BE GREAT.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.630
MOST IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT A BAND IS THE NAME.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.298
I SHOULD KNOW,
'CAUSE I HAD ONE.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.834
YOU HAD FIVE GUYS
IN GREG SAMSON'S GARAGE.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.302
WHAT WAS THE NAME?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.838
WE HAD THE BEST NAME EVER--
TICK BEAUDINE.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.574
IT WAS SOME GUY
I SAW IN A WESTERN
WHEN I WAS A KID.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.443
Noel: GUYS,
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.513
THANKS FOR THE PIZZA, NOEL.
DON'T PUT IT AWAY.

28:02.515 --> 28:05.015
IT'LL BE PERFECT
ROOM TEMPERATURE
WHEN WE GET BACK.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.518
( doorbell rings )
THAT'S THE GUY
BACK WITH THE CRAZY BREAD.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.319
NO! NO, IT'S
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.622
I PAID FOR CRAZY BREAD,
I WANT MY CRAZY BREAD.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.929
CAN YOU AT LEAST PRETEND
TO BE HAVING A GOOD TIME,
FOR ME, PLEASE?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.364
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.366
ARIA, THE LIGHTS
IN THIS HOUSE ARE DIMMING

28:22.368 --> 28:24.234
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE ENERGY YOU'RE
SUCKING OUT OF THE AIR.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.370
OKAY, WELL, I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.738
Noel: LOOK WHO'S HERE.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.574
IT WASN'T THE CRAZY BREAD.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.109
HI.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.578
HEY, LUCAS.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.580
UH, I JUST CAME BY
TO TELL YOU

28:36.582 --> 28:38.749
THAT THE THING THAT
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
WORKED OUT.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.050
OH. GOOD.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.286
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
IF YOU WANT.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.120
OKAY.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.626
I'LL... SEE YOU LATER.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.901
WHAT'S HE DOING,
COMING TO YOUR HOUSE?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.870
UH, NOTHING.
YEARBOOK STUFF.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.416
WHAT'S YOUR DAD'S RANK?

29:12.418 --> 29:15.919
LIEUTENANT COLONEL,
PENNSYLVANIA NATIONAL GUARD.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.922
AND HE'S BEEN
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT?

29:18.924 --> 29:21.091
CAMP PHOENIX, IN KABUL.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.462
OH, MY GOD.
WHEN'S HE GET BACK?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.097
TEN DAYS.

29:27.099 --> 29:30.601
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW HAPPY YOU ARE.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.103
WHEN I SEE HIM,
I'LL BE HAPPY.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.638
WHEN HE'S REALLY HOME.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.540
THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO START BREATHING AGAIN.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.245
DO I GET TO MEET HIM?

29:42.948 --> 29:44.615
<i> ( movie music begins )</i>

30:07.473 --> 30:09.373
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE WEATHER.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.841
RAIN'S
STARTING AT MIDNIGHT,

30:10.843 --> 30:12.376
CONTINUING
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.846
I WISH THIS WAS
GONNA BE OUTSIDE,

30:15.848 --> 30:17.047
IN THE SUN.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.717
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

30:20.719 --> 30:23.654
YEAH. HOW 'BOUT YOU?

30:23.656 --> 30:25.889
I'LL JUST BE GLAD
WHEN THIS IS OVER.

30:25.891 --> 30:28.859
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE DEDICATION OR...

30:28.861 --> 30:30.661
FINDING OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALI?

30:30.663 --> 30:32.429
BOTH, I GUESS.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.701
THE DEDICATION
WILL BE FINE,
THANKS TO YOU.

30:37.703 --> 30:40.270
AND I LIT A FIRE
UNDER THE COPS.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.776
DID YOU KNOW THAT TOBY
CALLED ALISON?

30:45.778 --> 30:48.545
NO.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.414
WILDEN SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD ME,

30:50.416 --> 30:53.050
BUT HE WAS
EASY TO SHAKE UP.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.618
LIKE MOST BULLIES.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.228
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE

31:04.230 --> 31:06.763
WHO EVER REALLY
CHALLENGED ALISON.

31:06.765 --> 31:09.600
I REMEMBER
HEARING THE TWO OF YOU

31:09.602 --> 31:13.103
GETTING IN EACH OTHER'S
GRILLS A COUPLE OF TIMES.

31:13.105 --> 31:16.206
KEPT WAITING
FOR THE CATFIGHT,
BUT... NEVER HAPPENED.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.814
WHO DO<i> YOU</i> THINK
KILLED ALISON?

31:23.816 --> 31:26.316
THE POLICE
LIKE TOBY CAVANAUGH.

31:26.318 --> 31:31.088
IF THEY CAN'T FIND HIM,
THEY'LL START LIKING
SOMEONE ELSE.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.657
JUST SOMEONE,
OR SOMEONE IN PARTICULAR?

31:33.659 --> 31:35.959
DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

31:35.961 --> 31:38.629
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WANTED CLOSURE.

31:38.631 --> 31:42.766
MY MOM STILL NEEDS PILLS
TO GET TO SLEEP.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.301
WHEN THEY DON'T WORK,

31:44.303 --> 31:46.803
YOU CAN HEAR HER
WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE

31:46.805 --> 31:48.438
AT THREE IN THE MORNING.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.741
YOU THINK YOU'RE EVER
REALLY GONNA HAVE CLOSURE?

31:53.112 --> 31:54.945
I MEAN, AREN'T YOU
ALWAYS GOING TO BE

31:54.947 --> 31:58.382
"THE FRIEND OF THAT GIRL
WHO WAS MURDERED"?

31:58.384 --> 32:00.817
JUST LIKE YOU'LL
ALWAYS BE HER BROTHER?

32:00.819 --> 32:03.320
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE
WILL SEE US.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.455
THEY SOLVE IT
OR THEY DON'T.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.658
THAT'S NOT
GOING TO CHANGE, SO...

32:07.660 --> 32:10.661
I GUESS IT
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

32:10.663 --> 32:13.163
BUT WHAT ABOUT JUSTICE?

32:13.165 --> 32:16.266
YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT TO BRING JUSTICE
INTO THIS, DO YOU?

32:18.304 --> 32:19.303
WHY NOT?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.240
ALISON TOLD ME
ABOUT THE FIRE.

32:25.477 --> 32:29.346
ABOUT HOW YOU SAID
THE FIVE OF YOU
SHOULD ALL GO OVER

32:29.348 --> 32:32.316
AND TEACH TOBY A LESSON.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.851
HOW YOU GOT
THE STINK BOMB AND...

32:34.853 --> 32:37.754
CONVINCED THE REST OF
THE GIRLS TO BACK YOU UP.

32:37.756 --> 32:41.391
HOW YOU EVEN THREATENED TOBY
IF HE TOLD THE TRUTH.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.226
ALISON TOLD YOU THAT?

32:43.228 --> 32:45.862
YES, SHE DID.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.631
DID YOU BELIEVE HER?

32:53.238 --> 32:55.138
YOU ARE JUST LIKE
ALISON, AREN'T YOU?

32:56.875 --> 32:58.942
IN SOME WAYS, EVEN WORSE.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.982
( movie projector whirrs )

33:27.906 --> 33:29.039
YOU OKAY?

33:30.209 --> 33:31.842
SURE.

33:31.844 --> 33:35.612
WE ALL JUST WONDERED
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.280
SORRY.

33:37.282 --> 33:40.751
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

33:40.753 --> 33:42.285
YEAH, I GUESS.

33:42.287 --> 33:44.821
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR
ON SOMETHING, OKAY?

33:44.823 --> 33:47.624
REMIND ME, DID I RUN OVER
YOUR DOG OR SOMETHING?

33:47.626 --> 33:50.961
BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER
DOING ANYTHING TO GET YOU
THIS MAD AT ME.

33:50.963 --> 33:52.596
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.697
COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.000
I'M SORRY, NOEL.

33:57.002 --> 33:58.502
I...

33:58.504 --> 34:00.504
I SHOULD HAVE
SAID NO TO THIS.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.539
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.007
BAD IDEA GOING OUT,

34:04.009 --> 34:06.810
OR A BAD IDEA
GOING OUT WITH ME?

34:06.812 --> 34:09.179
NO. IT'S ME.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.848
YOU'RE GREAT. I MEAN...

34:11.850 --> 34:13.283
YOU'RE NOEL.

34:13.285 --> 34:15.585
TERRIFIC.
I'M A BRAND NAME.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.722
( faint chuckle )

34:18.724 --> 34:21.558
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR
FOLKS SPLITTING UP.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.493
THEY'RE NOT SPLIT.
THEY'RE SEPARATED.

34:23.495 --> 34:27.030
AND HANNA...
TOLD ME ABOUT THE BOY
BACK IN ICELAND.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.338
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.507
SO I GUESS THIS GUY
WAS SERIOUS.

34:40.979 --> 34:44.114
YEAH. HE WAS SPECIAL.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.817
HE<i> IS</i> SPECIAL, BUT...

34:46.819 --> 34:50.554
RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST
ALL THIS DISTANCE
BETWEEN US.

34:50.556 --> 34:51.755
DOES HE SPEAK ENGLISH?

34:53.392 --> 34:54.691
BEAUTIFULLY.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.526
TOO BAD.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.095
I WAS HOPING FOR
A LANGUAGE BARRIER.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.533
YEAH, I MEAN,
I KNOW WHAT I<i> WANT</i>
TO HAPPEN WITH HIM...

35:05.170 --> 35:06.636
BUT...

35:06.638 --> 35:09.573
I ALSO KNOW THAT
I HAVE TO BE REALISTIC,

35:09.575 --> 35:11.908
AND THERE'S ONLY
A COUPLE OF WAYS THAT
ALL THIS CAN PLAY OUT,

35:11.910 --> 35:15.278
AND IT RANGES
FROM MESSY TO BAD.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.881
AND EVEN IF IT
DOES WORK OUT,

35:17.883 --> 35:20.117
I STILL HAVE MY FAMILY
TO WORRY ABOUT.

35:20.119 --> 35:24.387
A MINUTE AGO, BACK WHEN
I GOT YOU TO SMILE,

35:24.389 --> 35:26.590
I THOUGHT
I MIGHT TRY FOR A KISS.

35:26.592 --> 35:30.127
NOW I THINK I'LL WAIT,
BUT I'M GONNA KEEP
MY OPTIONS OPEN...

35:30.129 --> 35:31.962
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.630
( cell phone ringing )

35:39.071 --> 35:41.004
Hanna: WAIT, SO SHE
TRIED TO PIN IT ON YOU?

35:41.006 --> 35:42.973
THAT'S WHAT
SHE TOLD JASON.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.508
Emily: BUT WHY YOU?

35:44.510 --> 35:46.376
BECAUSE SPENCER COULD
STAND UP TO HER,

35:46.378 --> 35:47.777
AND ALISON
DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.147
GOD, THIS IS
OFFICIALLY INSANE!

35:50.149 --> 35:51.414
IS THAT WHAT SHE
TOLD JENNA

35:51.416 --> 35:52.782
WHEN SHE WAS
AT THE HOSPITAL?

35:52.784 --> 35:54.384
I DON'T KNOW.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.286
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

35:56.288 --> 35:59.589
OKAY, SO-- SO ONE MINUTE,
SHE'S TRYING TO COVER IT UP

35:59.591 --> 36:01.691
AND THE NEXT SHE'S
RATTING US OUT TO HER BROTHER?

36:01.693 --> 36:03.860
LIKE SHE WANTED JASON
TO KNOW THE FAKE STORY

36:03.862 --> 36:05.529
IN CASE ANYTHING
HAPPENED TO HER.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.796
WHY?

36:06.798 --> 36:08.298
SO THEY'D KNOW WHO TO BLAME.

36:10.435 --> 36:12.469
Aria: GOD!

36:12.471 --> 36:14.437
THIS IS STILL
ALISON'S MOVIE,

36:14.439 --> 36:16.806
AND WE ARE JUST
FILLING UP THE SCREEN.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.708
( thunder crashes )

36:27.753 --> 36:29.819
YOU WENT
TO THE GROCERY STORE.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.522
UH, YEAH. I SOLD
SOME STUFF ONLINE.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.762
YOU SOLD SOME STUFF ONLINE?

36:38.764 --> 36:41.064
JUST A COUPLE OF BAGS
I WAS BORED WITH.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.535
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.571
DON'T SELL YOUR THINGS!

36:47.573 --> 36:49.372
NO, IT'S OKAY.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.209
REALLY, IT WAS FUN,
IN A NERDY WAY.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.244
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.713
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF THINGS. I PROMISE.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.716
MOM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
REALLY.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.526
YOU SHOULD GET GOING.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.094
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

37:11.096 --> 37:12.562
OKAY.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.666
( thunder crashes )

37:36.355 --> 37:37.887
IAN?

37:37.889 --> 37:39.656
WAIT-- MELISSA'S IAN?

37:41.727 --> 37:42.926
Spencer: UM...

37:48.700 --> 37:51.968
I CAN'T REMEMBER
NOT KNOWING ALISON...

37:53.772 --> 37:55.939
NOT HAVING HER AS A FRIEND.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.842
SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON
I KNEW LONG ENOUGH

37:58.844 --> 38:02.445
THAT I FELT I COULD
BE ANGRY WITH

38:02.447 --> 38:04.381
WITHOUT WORRYING
THAT I WAS GONNA LOSE HER.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.419
IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE
SOMETHING WAS GONNA LAST,

38:09.421 --> 38:13.290
AND YOU NEED THAT,

38:13.292 --> 38:15.125
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE A KID.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.627
Hanna: FRIENDS CAN BE
HARD ON YOU.

38:17.629 --> 38:21.298
MAYBE THEY EXPECT
MORE FROM YOU THAN STRANGERS.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.966
STRANGERS PRETTY MUCH
SEE YOU

38:22.968 --> 38:24.834
THE WAY YOU
WANT THEM TO SEE YOU,

38:24.836 --> 38:27.537
BUT... YOU CAN'T
FOOL FRIENDS.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.608
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES THEM FRIENDS.

38:34.780 --> 38:38.315
THAT CORNER OF THE PARK
IS GOING TO BE A SAFE PLACE

38:38.317 --> 38:41.451
WHERE YOU CAN GO AND SIT,
READ A BOOK,

38:41.453 --> 38:43.620
AND JUST THINK.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.122
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT
ALISON WHILE YOU'RE THERE.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.992
SHE'D WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT HER.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.563
YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS--

38:53.565 --> 38:56.032
A MEMORIAL--

38:56.034 --> 39:01.171
PARTLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENED.

39:01.173 --> 39:04.574
SO, YOU-- YOU PLANT FLOWERS
AND YOU PAINT TILES, AND...

39:06.745 --> 39:09.779
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THAT WORK,

39:09.781 --> 39:11.448
YOU STOP CRYING.

39:13.452 --> 39:16.386
I GUESS THAT'S THE POINT.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.656
SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED
THAT YOU WERE ALL HERE.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.425
SHE WOULD HAVE
LIKED THE ATTENTION.

39:22.427 --> 39:25.962
NO, ACTUALLY, SHE WOULD
HAVE<i> LOVED</i> THE ATTENTION.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.400
IT WOULD HAVE
MADE HER LAUGH.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.038
AND ALISON LAUGHING...

39:38.410 --> 39:39.976
THAT WAS AMAZING.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.838
WE THINK WE KNOW
WHO WE ARE,

40:08.840 --> 40:10.840
BUT WE DON'T.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.009
NOT UNTIL SOMETHING
BAD HAPPENS TO US,

40:13.011 --> 40:16.679
AND THEN ALL
THE USELESS THINGS
FALL AWAY,

40:16.681 --> 40:19.616
AND WE'RE LEFT WITH
WHO WE REALLY ARE.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.051
I LEARNT THAT
FROM ALISON DiLAURENTIS.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.658
MY WHOLE LIFE, I THOUGHT
I KNEW WHO SHE WAS,

40:28.660 --> 40:32.996
BUT I FOUND OUT THE TRUTH
WHEN SHE CAME AND TALKED
TO ME AT THE HOSPITAL.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.697
I FOUND OUT

40:34.699 --> 40:38.034
THAT SHE WAS
THE STRONGEST PERSON

40:38.036 --> 40:40.069
THAT I HAD EVER MET.

40:40.071 --> 40:44.040
AND IT'S HER STRENGTH
THAT TOUCHED SO MANY PEOPLE.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.341
SHAPED THEM.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.610
THAT'S HER REAL LEGACY.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.547
THAT'S HOW HER MEMORY
WILL ENDURE,

40:50.549 --> 40:53.917
IN THE ACTIONS OF THOSE
SHE INSPIRED

40:53.919 --> 40:57.887
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.023
FROM ALL OF US...

41:00.025 --> 41:01.858
THANK YOU, ALISON.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.493
( thunder crashes )

41:08.533 --> 41:10.733
( sighs )
I NEED SUGAR.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.435
ME TOO.
I'M BUYING.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.140
THAT WAS MY FOLKS.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.975
THEY SAY THANKS.

41:18.977 --> 41:19.943
SO DO I.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.445
YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:22.447 --> 41:26.049
AND I WANT YOU GIRLS
TO HAVE SOMETHING.

41:26.051 --> 41:28.451
THE POLICE RETURNED
THIS TO MY FAMILY.

41:28.453 --> 41:29.919
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE IT.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.390
THE POLICE
GAVE THAT TO YOU?

41:34.392 --> 41:36.726
ALISON WAS WEARING IT.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.761
YOU MEAN WHEN THEY
<i> FOUND</i> HER?

41:38.763 --> 41:41.097
AFTER LISTENING TODAY,

41:41.099 --> 41:43.466
I JUST...
THOUGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE IT.

41:47.239 --> 41:48.271
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.777
IF THAT'S
ALISON'S BRACELET,

41:54.779 --> 41:56.846
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE
WE FOUND IN THE WOODS?

41:56.848 --> 41:59.649
I-I DON'T KNOW.

41:59.651 --> 42:02.986
SOMEONE MADE A COPY
OF ALISON'S BRACELET.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.854
YEAH, AND MADE SURE
THAT WE WOULD FIND IT.

42:10.929 --> 42:13.463
( thunder crashes )
