WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.616
The Germans seem damn close
to producing an atomic bomb.

00:02.642 --> 00:05.056
We have no option but to go in
and raid Bringle Sands.

00:05.082 --> 00:07.183
Still, we can sabotage the rest.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.376
You want me to get the King
to Bringle Sands?

00:09.489 --> 00:12.494
An American plane will fly
His Majesty out to the Ark Royal

00:12.520 --> 00:15.468
but only if we can get
the King there in time.

00:15.617 --> 00:17.377
These are the atomic calculations.

00:17.697 --> 00:19.359
Spode photographed them.

00:19.507 --> 00:21.894
You're the safer pair of hands
to get it to America.

00:22.027 --> 00:25.312
Bernard Staines is dead. Beaten
to death from what I can tell.

00:25.338 --> 00:28.130
What should we do?
If he was tortured, if he talked?!

00:28.156 --> 00:29.345
I want you to stand ready

00:29.371 --> 00:31.567
to get out, as soon as I get
Barbara Barga to you.

00:31.593 --> 00:34.487
So Harry's right,
you are up to something.

00:40.110 --> 00:42.090
Tomorrow morning you will be ready?

00:42.116 --> 00:44.285
- For Bluejacket?
- Yes.

00:44.854 --> 00:48.763
You will come to the back of the
hospital, an ambulance is waiting.

00:49.074 --> 00:51.683
The army will help you this one time.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.543
Barbara?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.620 --> 02:01.834
He's got the whole floor
to himself, apparently.

02:01.860 --> 02:02.900
Yeah.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.620
You ever thought this could
all just be a set up?

02:07.139 --> 02:08.627
Only every five minutes.

02:36.077 --> 02:37.477
Come on.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.374
Doug.

02:56.947 --> 02:58.321
Your Majesty.

03:28.431 --> 03:29.511
Archer?

03:33.532 --> 03:37.292
Morphine, for when the pain is too much.

03:40.578 --> 03:41.858
All right.

03:51.524 --> 03:52.703
Are you all right, sir?

04:05.944 --> 04:07.170
Good luck, Archer.

04:08.254 --> 04:09.494
God save the King.

06:15.857 --> 06:17.262
Come with me.

06:46.460 --> 06:47.831
Are you all right, Doug?

06:48.809 --> 06:51.066
The clutch is going,
I can't get it into gear.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.135
That's all we bloody need.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.775
Where's the nearest garage?

06:56.419 --> 06:57.637
Not near enough.

07:09.161 --> 07:10.161
OK.

07:14.409 --> 07:17.552
Have you thought, if we do pull
this off and he gets to America,

07:18.099 --> 07:19.669
what the world will think of him?

07:20.602 --> 07:22.535
Well, you can't tell me the Germans
didn't know what they were doing,

07:22.560 --> 07:23.853
handing him over.

07:24.036 --> 07:27.160
We've got our work cut out to get
there in time for the plane.

07:29.319 --> 07:30.488
Wait here.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.828
- Hello?
- <i>Sylvia? Is the block warden listening?</i>

08:18.874 --> 08:20.895
- Yes.
- <i>Ignore the bastard.</i>

08:21.140 --> 08:23.447
I'm sorry I had to have him get you,
but I need your help.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.332
Well, that would be quite delightful.

08:46.444 --> 08:49.332
I don't know what is keeping
Superintendent Archer.

08:49.956 --> 08:54.120
But I know he's a friend of yours
and I rather hoped he could...

08:55.049 --> 08:56.609
help us here.

08:58.589 --> 09:00.507
Exactly why am I being held here?

09:01.591 --> 09:02.886
That's obvious...

09:03.539 --> 09:05.199
for your own protection.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.526
I'd rather be in the protection
of the American Embassy.

09:15.983 --> 09:20.300
The problem is you haven't
behaved in accordance

09:20.326 --> 09:22.608
with our agreement with
your government...

09:22.964 --> 09:25.739
specifically in your contacts

09:25.765 --> 09:29.539
with so-called Resistance fighters.

09:32.768 --> 09:36.238
I am a neutral journalist,
following a story.

09:37.654 --> 09:39.735
My country is not at war with yours.

09:39.761 --> 09:43.875
I do not believe you are simply
a journalist, Miss Barga.

09:43.922 --> 09:46.458
I think you are also an agent

09:46.484 --> 09:50.055
who wants to lure America
into conflict with the Reich.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.578
You're worrying about nothing.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.250
Pick up any American newspaper
and you'll see.

09:56.759 --> 09:58.940
"No War Talk Here"... that's the mantra

09:59.389 --> 10:02.510
and, frankly, I'm ashamed.

10:03.958 --> 10:07.440
Good. I prefer honesty to pretence.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.455
That doesn't make me a spy.

10:11.237 --> 10:12.193
No.

10:14.123 --> 10:15.980
That makes you a challenge.

10:16.599 --> 10:19.124
Look, I'm telling you,
I don't know anything.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.379
Well done. Good to see you.

11:59.405 --> 12:00.991
Glad you're all right, Harry.

12:01.912 --> 12:03.327
Thanks for bringing the car.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.653
You can find your own way back?

12:07.122 --> 12:08.427
I don't understand.

12:09.409 --> 12:11.237
It's not really safe
for you to be with us.

12:13.260 --> 12:14.740
Or to know about this.

12:16.621 --> 12:20.021
So it's him, George.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.260
I thought wrong of you, Doug.

12:26.016 --> 12:27.122
Your Majesty.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.688
Sylvia, we've got to get going.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.328
Well, let me come with you.

12:34.082 --> 12:37.157
He needs looking after and there's
nothing for me here, Doug.

12:37.183 --> 12:38.183
You know that.

12:44.371 --> 12:46.171
Let's not stand around here.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.528
Come on.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.421
I don't know what is going on
between Herr Doktor Huth

13:31.447 --> 13:32.737
and Superintendent Archer,

13:32.763 --> 13:36.095
but I think you may be able
to shed some light on it.

13:36.453 --> 13:39.253
My government doesn't like
its citizens being tortured.

13:39.279 --> 13:41.154
I'm afraid they will
never know, my dear.

13:43.010 --> 13:46.634
But if you answer my questions,
we won't have to engage one another

13:46.660 --> 13:49.329
in such... horrors.

13:52.861 --> 13:55.520
Why did you burn
the piece of film at your house?

13:58.140 --> 14:00.420
What images did it contain?

14:11.180 --> 14:15.020
I really don't want our friend
here to damage such...

14:16.160 --> 14:18.324
...fragrant skin.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.009
So, I repeat...

14:21.480 --> 14:24.658
What was in the images you destroyed?

14:30.310 --> 14:31.530
Answer me!

14:38.680 --> 14:39.654
<i>Ja?</i>

15:00.760 --> 15:01.929
Kellermann.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.740
SS. They're checking identity papers.

15:12.353 --> 15:13.890
We can still turn round.

15:14.878 --> 15:16.142
No, it's too late.

15:31.623 --> 15:32.855
You and Sylvia get out and walk.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.240
Take that corner, I'll meet you
further round. I'll distract them.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.529
That's an order.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.495
Come on, we can pretend to be lovers.

15:45.725 --> 15:46.920
Don't get carried away.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.200
Back in a minute, Georgie.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.145
Sorry about the "Georgie", sir.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.142
Come on! Move!

16:21.840 --> 16:23.369
What's the matter?

17:33.760 --> 17:37.080
Thank God. I thought I'd had it.

17:37.177 --> 17:38.920
We're not out of the building yet.

18:03.742 --> 18:05.582
Have you heard from Douglas Archer?

18:05.797 --> 18:09.237
He did ring... just to enquire
about you. Since then, nothing.

18:10.864 --> 18:13.874
But whether he gets the King
out or not, the raid is on.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.444
Things are going to hot up.

18:17.627 --> 18:19.844
The terms of your release
are immediate deportation.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.578
You're to be kept under armed guard
at the Ambassador's Residence

18:23.610 --> 18:25.935
until you can be escorted
straight to the aeroplane

18:25.960 --> 18:27.535
and flown back to Washington.

18:39.191 --> 18:40.276
Kellermann.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.920
Well, that was a relief.

19:27.196 --> 19:29.998
Look, sir. It's England.

19:30.875 --> 19:31.984
Your land.

19:33.158 --> 19:34.752
It's Hampshire, sir.

19:34.946 --> 19:36.604
I know a Hampshire song.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.222
I bet you do.

19:38.515 --> 19:39.631
Go on, Harry.

19:39.939 --> 19:41.742
Really? - Yeah.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.953
♪ Well, once I courted a pretty girl ♪

19:47.160 --> 19:49.295
♪ I courted her quite well ♪

19:49.490 --> 19:51.994

19:52.020 --> 19:54.175

19:58.947 --> 20:00.387
♪ He says if I... ♪

21:12.800 --> 21:16.217
Two hours to get the King to Bringle
and we haven't got a bloody jack!

22:44.080 --> 22:47.228
We're going to have to stop.
We don't have much choice.

22:55.697 --> 22:57.892
You have a hunt around.
There must be a jack somewhere.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.253
I need your help,
I've not done this before.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.751
Hold that.

23:34.366 --> 23:38.135
George, I'm going to give you
an injection for the pain.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.629
It will make you feel better.

23:51.588 --> 23:52.908
Thank you.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.360
They mustn't see him.

24:03.801 --> 24:05.043
Hello!

24:05.958 --> 24:08.737
We hope you don't mind.
We didn't want to disturb you.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.568
We'll be on our way as soon
as we've fixed this.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.084
Where are you heading?

24:18.274 --> 24:20.166
Visiting friends near Dorchester.

24:21.554 --> 24:24.298
Pal of ours isn't in the best of health.

24:25.232 --> 24:26.624
Have you got some water?

24:28.817 --> 24:30.198
You all want to come in?

24:35.826 --> 24:37.440
We don't want to be any trouble.

24:40.314 --> 24:41.473
Come through.

24:42.206 --> 24:43.365
Thank you.

24:49.202 --> 24:51.780
Better it should happen now,
what with the light fading.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.195
Yes.

24:53.267 --> 24:54.642
What's wrong with your friend?

24:54.800 --> 24:58.295
Just a touch of influenza,
it's worse with old age.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.615
Of course.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.200
Friends in Dorchester?
You come from London?

25:04.680 --> 25:06.890
Yes, but it's good to get out.

25:06.916 --> 25:08.673
We've had some real
pea soupers recently.

25:08.699 --> 25:10.538
It's great to breathe again, isn't it?

25:11.152 --> 25:13.352
I'm David. This is my wife, Margaret.

25:16.177 --> 25:17.337
I'm Frank.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.558
Alice.

25:19.028 --> 25:21.208
- Are you married?
- No. - No.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.805
Ah, there you are.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.695
That's David's brother.

25:26.465 --> 25:27.965
Give us a hand, will you?

25:32.647 --> 25:34.320
Get some water from the well.

25:39.254 --> 25:40.641
Sit yourselves down.

25:41.312 --> 25:43.563
- Margaret, make some tea.
- Yeah.

25:44.062 --> 25:45.644
Do you want to see if
your friends want some?

25:49.718 --> 25:51.866
Well, we wouldn't want you to waste
your rations on us.

25:52.140 --> 25:57.246
No problem. "Times like these."
"Fellow man" and all that.

25:58.490 --> 25:59.520
Yes.

26:58.735 --> 27:00.927
I heard the shots.
What was all that about?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.288
They're bloody collaborators.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.503
I thought their shelves were
a little too well stocked.

27:04.529 --> 27:07.215
Whoever it was was about to alert
a German patrol that we're here

27:07.240 --> 27:09.724
and they'd have arrived before we
had time to change that tyre.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.792
- How long do you need?
- The spare's flat.

27:11.818 --> 27:13.366
We'll take their car.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.920
Get ready to move the passenger,
we can't stay here.

27:17.662 --> 27:18.682
Yeah.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.063
What have you done?!

27:26.550 --> 27:27.961
Are there any other weapons?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.455
- I've checked.
- Did you hurt him?

27:30.480 --> 27:32.341
Handcuff her ankle to his wrist.

27:36.609 --> 27:39.495
You hand out the food vouchers and
the mail from the POW camps, yes?

27:39.520 --> 27:40.975
Someone has to do it!

27:41.000 --> 27:43.455
Spying on villagers in return
for a comfortable life?

27:44.050 --> 27:45.277
Where are the car keys?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.551
Where are the car keys?!

28:00.123 --> 28:01.335
We have to go, come on.

28:20.443 --> 28:22.100
You did what you had to, Doug.

28:26.476 --> 28:27.707
Sir...

29:13.210 --> 29:17.595
Well, as far as I can tell, we're here.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.948
The airfield near the
atomic research centre.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.814
Shame nobody else is.

29:40.371 --> 29:41.353
Burnham?

29:42.595 --> 29:43.520
Archer?

29:45.469 --> 29:47.575
Got anywhere warm we can take our guest?

29:48.148 --> 29:50.219
The best we can offer
is brandy and pheasant.

29:51.128 --> 29:52.815
Any contact from Colonel Mayhew?

29:52.840 --> 29:55.680
Still waiting.
Any moment now, one hopes.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.960
All right.

30:34.532 --> 30:37.135
Most of the Auxiliary Units got
blotted out in the first two weeks

30:37.160 --> 30:38.497
after the invasion,

30:39.087 --> 30:41.830
so Mayhew ordered
the Resistance to hold fire.

30:43.192 --> 30:44.594
Live to fight another day.

30:45.867 --> 30:47.335
But the game's all up now,

30:47.840 --> 30:49.080
or will be.

30:52.163 --> 30:53.565
All we get are rumours.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.240
Can you tell us what's going on, sir?

30:57.680 --> 30:59.695
For men, risking their lives...

30:59.963 --> 31:01.069
do we have a hope?

31:02.469 --> 31:04.048
A lot hinges on tonight.

31:06.685 --> 31:08.195
Everything, I'd say.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.954
Sir, it's Colonel Mayhew.

31:13.759 --> 31:15.632
We'll need a stretcher, if you have one.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.145
Archer here.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.346
- Do you have Bluejacket?
- <i>Yes.</i>

31:24.372 --> 31:25.362
Good man.

31:26.040 --> 31:29.178
We're on the other side of the
airfield, by the old control tower.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.244
Best come as quickly as you can.

31:32.919 --> 31:34.335
Let's get Bluejacket on his way.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.616
<i>What about the raid on the
atomic research centre?</i>

31:36.952 --> 31:38.827
It's imminent. We're on schedule.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.043
All right, let's go.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.406
Operation's a go.

31:49.406 --> 31:51.039
Where the hell is the plane?

31:51.428 --> 31:53.440
Come on, Doug. Can't hang about.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.258
You've got 20 minutes to
get to Bringle, Danny.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.895
I'll join you as soon as
the King is dispatched.

32:07.108 --> 32:08.600
Here's to merry hell.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.019
<i>Is everything all right?
Have you made contact yet?</i>

32:32.759 --> 32:33.801
Yes.

32:34.807 --> 32:36.200
They're on their way.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.378
Well, there's the old control tower.

32:44.319 --> 32:46.400
But where's Mayhew and the plane?

32:57.747 --> 33:00.000
- Get the stretcher, Harry.
- Yeah.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.762
Sylvia?

33:25.480 --> 33:26.660
Mayhew?

33:34.886 --> 33:36.126
Mayhew!

33:41.920 --> 33:43.295
Incoming!

33:43.320 --> 33:44.495
German attack!

33:54.760 --> 33:56.431
Get the King out of here! It's a trap!

34:03.298 --> 34:04.496
Go!

34:05.347 --> 34:06.593
Harry!

34:12.588 --> 34:14.628
Sylvia, just go!

34:15.600 --> 34:16.880
Go!

35:54.920 --> 35:58.262
By what route were the scientists
to get to the plane?

35:59.397 --> 36:02.405
Get an army officer here
and I'll answer.

36:02.431 --> 36:04.111
I don't talk to you SS...

38:42.591 --> 38:44.680
Ah. You're awake.

38:51.266 --> 38:54.463
You know, you are the only man here

38:54.988 --> 38:57.043
who could appreciate this place.

38:59.180 --> 39:01.820
Actually, I'm not all that up
on Georgian architecture.

39:04.485 --> 39:05.534
Follow me.

39:08.752 --> 39:13.786
The Georgian part... the facade
and one wing... is from 1796.

39:14.578 --> 39:17.634
Actually, this house
is mainly Elizabethan.

39:18.661 --> 39:22.155
I spent a few happy weekends here
when I was up at Oxford.

39:22.750 --> 39:26.840
And then I looked over the wall
as we were passing and here it was.

39:28.320 --> 39:32.759
Tobias Trotter. A genial fellow,
presumably dead now.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.216
His sister was a beauty,

39:35.242 --> 39:36.838
raven-haired and...

39:38.296 --> 39:39.805
a little wild.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.217
Late one night, she showed me...

39:44.357 --> 39:45.848
...their priest hole.

39:48.107 --> 39:49.774
Catholics, you see.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.724
And being good Catholics...

39:53.833 --> 39:55.538
they put it to good use.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.193
Let us find something
we can drink this out of.

40:03.350 --> 40:04.295
You know,

40:04.320 --> 40:07.053
when I saw the old man's
body in the car,

40:07.079 --> 40:09.155
I thought it must be Professor Frick.

40:09.840 --> 40:14.323
It was only when I saw you lying
there that I realised who it was.

40:15.334 --> 40:17.280
And who was the girl?

40:18.480 --> 40:19.611
Sylvia.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.880
I had no idea you were still...

40:25.280 --> 40:27.651
But then it turns out
I am easily deceived.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.452
Mayhew played me like a fool.

40:31.409 --> 40:32.735
I didn't know you knew him.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.763
I had him squirming on the hook
within days of arriving here.

40:37.213 --> 40:42.240
I had a spy in the court of Von Ruff
who reported their assignations.

40:43.661 --> 40:44.713
I know.

40:52.524 --> 40:54.077
Mayhew is a master.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.967
He had me believing
I had him in the vice.

40:58.280 --> 41:02.015
Confessed to a plot to fly the top
scientists out of Bringle Sands

41:02.040 --> 41:03.038
to America.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.618
What made you believe
he'd betray his own people?

41:06.644 --> 41:08.135
That's where he was clever.

41:08.875 --> 41:11.854
He said it was doomed to failure anyway,

41:12.290 --> 41:15.095
so he made a deal where
he could hang on to most

41:15.120 --> 41:17.364
of his family's textile
business in the north.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.855
Selfishness is a motive I fully embrace.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.855
He lied. And I was duped.

41:24.519 --> 41:27.655
So you came down here to prevent
the escape of the scientists.

41:27.844 --> 41:29.562
Be the hero of the hour.

41:31.633 --> 41:34.255
And all along, Mayhew just wanted
me to cause a distraction

41:34.280 --> 41:35.893
while the real attack was launched.

41:36.683 --> 41:38.388
I didn't see that coming.

41:40.358 --> 41:41.386
Americans?

41:46.435 --> 41:49.091
If anyone can make this
bomb work, it's them.

41:49.250 --> 41:52.194
Especially now with the research
from Bringle.

42:03.372 --> 42:05.373
It was Mayhew who killed Spode.

42:07.396 --> 42:09.796
It was him who burned the papers.

42:12.145 --> 42:15.406
He just didn't want the Americans
to get the calculations too easily.

42:17.005 --> 42:18.734
He wanted them to fight for it.

42:20.047 --> 42:23.167
And to destroy any of the work
that was completed at Bringle Sands.

42:25.796 --> 42:27.560
Yes, of course.

42:29.267 --> 42:32.923
Although perhaps he misjudged how
important Spode's calculations were.

42:34.664 --> 42:37.711
Their absence will cost
the Americans time.

42:38.916 --> 42:40.038
Standartenfuehrer.

43:54.978 --> 43:58.120
It didn't take Kellermann long
to seize his moment.

44:17.993 --> 44:19.833
Firing squads everywhere.

44:23.027 --> 44:25.291
13 men shot in Swanage.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.208
27 in East Lulworth.

44:38.824 --> 44:41.709
They're punishing villages
for harbouring Resistance,

44:41.735 --> 44:43.024
whether they have or not.

44:44.985 --> 44:47.928
I wonder if the price is worth
paying in Mayhew's book.

44:49.482 --> 44:50.802
Any news on him?

44:57.007 --> 44:58.527
But Kellermann is close.

45:00.824 --> 45:03.600
What do you expect me to do? Run?

45:06.227 --> 45:07.731
I'm a lost cause.

45:09.320 --> 45:13.867
Kellermann will use me as a
scapegoat, twist things against me.

45:15.109 --> 45:16.792
Can you believe he has already implied

45:16.818 --> 45:19.120
I was involved in the Karl Marx bomb?

45:21.854 --> 45:24.480
He'll keep his job and get rid of me.

45:27.947 --> 45:30.166
We were all playing for high stakes.

45:31.317 --> 45:34.720
But you, you still have a chance.

45:37.640 --> 45:41.880
Arrest me, Archer,
for when Kellermann arrives.

45:46.523 --> 45:49.324
I'll wager he has no proof
you helped the King escape.

45:50.266 --> 45:53.424
You can be a hero, too. Do it.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.398
You have a son to live for.

45:57.099 --> 45:59.085
All I have is a father I hate.

46:04.085 --> 46:05.960
The pig has won.

46:07.843 --> 46:09.375
So have the army.

46:09.624 --> 46:11.375
They can use the attack as a pretext

46:11.400 --> 46:14.725
for martial law across the entire
occupied region now.

46:16.074 --> 46:17.770
But the real winner is Mayhew.

46:18.200 --> 46:19.986
He got the Americans fighting.

46:21.160 --> 46:24.855
They've tasted blood, and mark my words,

46:24.880 --> 46:28.789
they will build this bomb
and the Reich will be finished.

46:32.384 --> 46:34.495
Mayhew's only false step
was allowing the King

46:34.520 --> 46:35.904
to get caught up in it.

46:37.385 --> 46:38.729
That wasn't an accident.

46:39.789 --> 46:41.922
The King was never meant to escape.

46:45.548 --> 46:47.060
He was infirm.

46:50.207 --> 46:54.428
He would have cut a pathetic figure
in Washington or anywhere else.

46:55.478 --> 46:57.306
Britain would have looked washed up.

46:58.920 --> 47:03.941
Instead he dies a hero, in the same
operation as brave Americans.

47:07.699 --> 47:09.380
I bet in the next few days,

47:11.458 --> 47:15.215
the Queen and the Princesses
will be on a ship from New Zealand

47:15.240 --> 47:17.230
for Washington to represent us.

47:20.027 --> 47:21.709
That's the way Mayhew works.

47:23.704 --> 47:24.872
The long game.

47:25.937 --> 47:27.017
Hmm.

47:27.760 --> 47:31.015
Well then, with men like that,

47:31.338 --> 47:33.268
how did you ever lose the war?

47:34.337 --> 47:35.697
Perhaps we didn't.

47:38.760 --> 47:40.076
Just the battle.

47:50.392 --> 47:52.626
Does your son want to be a policeman?

47:56.040 --> 47:57.080
Yes.

47:58.601 --> 47:59.800
Yes, he does.

48:02.329 --> 48:03.760
But on a motorcycle.

48:09.034 --> 48:10.403
You are lucky, Archer.

48:13.487 --> 48:16.429
Keep him out of this... lousy business.

48:27.937 --> 48:29.908
Your last chance, Douglas.

48:33.080 --> 48:34.401
Think of him.

48:41.297 --> 48:42.750
Priest hole.

48:47.952 --> 48:50.691
That fool Kellermann
wouldn't even know what one was.

53:45.508 --> 53:46.831
He's come round.

53:58.482 --> 53:59.821
Where am I?

54:01.440 --> 54:02.985
Sorry, old pal.

54:03.440 --> 54:06.760
You had a nasty little bullet down
there that we took a dislike to.

54:11.591 --> 54:13.151
How did I get here?

54:19.396 --> 54:21.294
You're the only survivor we found.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.267
It was a bloodbath.

54:31.206 --> 54:32.976
What about Douglas Archer?

54:33.825 --> 54:35.360
No sign of him.

54:38.035 --> 54:39.400
Now, you rest.

54:51.089 --> 54:53.323
39 men unaccounted for.

54:54.306 --> 54:56.561
64 walking wounded,

54:56.769 --> 54:58.793
8 serious casualties.

54:59.957 --> 55:01.615
They're still compiling
the list of Bringle personnel

55:01.640 --> 55:03.604
they now have on the ship with them.

55:05.840 --> 55:08.688
Reporting the facility
as totally destroyed.

55:08.840 --> 55:11.920
Yes! Good. What about the data?

55:14.046 --> 55:15.286
Incomplete.

55:18.266 --> 55:21.320
Your flight's soon. I don't think
you'll be welcomed back in...

55:22.922 --> 55:24.055
Miss Barga?

55:30.680 --> 55:33.074
Miss Barga! What are you doing?
