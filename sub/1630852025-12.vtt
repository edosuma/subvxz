02:37.490 --> 02:38.574
It's got to be a void.

02:38.733 --> 02:40.409
That's a phenomenon

02:40.493 --> 02:41.910
- right there.
- TEDFORD: Yeah.

02:42.069 --> 02:44.913
This same phenomena would occur

- Exactly.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.335
<i>NARRATOR:
This has led to speculation</i>

02:50.420 --> 02:52.996
<i>that they may have encountered

02:53.080 --> 02:56.416
<i>connected

02:56.500 --> 02:59.669
The general area where we are
conducting this drill program

02:59.754 --> 03:01.838
I think
is exceedingly interesting.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.424
And it's certainly on the radar
or marked

03:04.508 --> 03:06.843
as a potential
"X" marks the spot

03:14.518 --> 03:16.186
It isn't here, Charles.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.355
- We didn't expect it to be.
- Yeah.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.116
So, anyway,
as we get to target depth

03:21.201 --> 03:23.785
around 65 or 70 feet,

03:23.870 --> 03:26.121
I'm very hopeful
we're gonna hit something.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.949
- Perhaps the offset chamber.
- CHARLES: Yep.

03:29.033 --> 03:31.960
And hopefully that'll get us
to where the can placements go.

03:32.119 --> 03:35.455
- Exactly.
<i>- NARRATOR: Now, as they drill a new borehole</i>

04:09.490 --> 04:11.583
I want to know the whole story.

04:11.742 --> 04:13.994
And the whole story
will be written underground

04:14.087 --> 04:16.663
in a vault, a void, a cavity,

04:16.747 --> 04:19.341
a-a construct,
a human construct.

04:19.500 --> 04:23.220
To me,
that's gold in and of itself.

04:24.255 --> 04:26.089
- Hey, guys.
- CHARLES: Hey, Alex.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.174
- Hi, Alex.
- ALEX: What'd I miss?

04:28.268 --> 04:31.928
- CHARLES: Not much.
- Not too much. We are now only about two and a half feet away

04:32.021 --> 04:34.514
from where we intersected
the air cavity.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.859
You'd think we'd hit something,
right? Because unless we got,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.279
really, I guess, lucky
and hit the very top

04:40.363 --> 04:41.947
of the air cavity
on the first hole,

04:42.031 --> 04:44.283
- there should be more down there.
- Absolutely.

04:44.442 --> 04:48.453
We could be in the area
of an offset chamber

04:48.538 --> 04:51.364
- for, hopefully, the treasure beyond all imagining.
- Yeah.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.866
And here comes the core.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.127
- Hey, Adam. How we doing?
- 28.

04:55.286 --> 04:56.712
TERRY:
Thank you.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.049
- Thank you.
- TERRY: 18 to 28.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.803
If we drill this anomaly
and we go into a void,

05:04.962 --> 05:06.296
even if we don't bring up
anything else,

05:06.389 --> 05:09.299
then it'd be worth putting
a caisson down there, for sure.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.135
<i>Because
it's not a natural cavern.</i>

05:12.228 --> 05:13.887
TERRY: We have no
break, no disturbance.

05:13.971 --> 05:15.564
Nothing remarkable yet.

05:15.723 --> 05:20.060
So, we're still
about 30 to 35 feet

05:20.144 --> 05:21.820
above where we hope to intersect

05:21.979 --> 05:24.230
our chamber.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.815
<i>Let's hope we get it today.</i>

05:25.900 --> 05:28.318

<i>where they have gathered

05:49.432 --> 05:50.840
CLARKE: So, I've found, I
believe, significant information

05:50.933 --> 05:53.426
that really strengthens,
uh, the idea

05:53.519 --> 05:56.104
- of there being silver in this area.
- Interesting.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.274
<i>NARRATOR:

<i>to share information

06:04.688 --> 06:06.356
<i>of the Oak Island mystery.</i>

06:06.449 --> 06:08.441
RICK:
Scott is presenting a theory

06:08.526 --> 06:11.119
about the William Phips
and the salvage

06:11.204 --> 06:13.288
of the<i> Concepción</i> treasure.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.199
And why it's so intriguing
at this point, of course,

06:16.292 --> 06:18.535
is because of the silver
from the water sampling

06:18.619 --> 06:20.712
- we've done in the Money Pit.
- Yeah.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.956
- So, Scott, please proceed.
- CLARKE: Okay, thank you.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.541
So, as you just mentioned, uh,

06:24.634 --> 06:25.708
many people
are actually familiar

06:25.802 --> 06:26.709
with William Phips's discovery

06:26.794 --> 06:30.055
of the<i> Concepción</i> back in 1687.

06:30.214 --> 06:32.549
We know that Phips found silver
on the<i> Concepción,</i>

06:32.642 --> 06:34.726
and I believe
some of the treasure

06:34.885 --> 06:37.220
from the<i> Concepción</i>
was secreted to Oak Island.

06:37.304 --> 06:38.480
Very interesting.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.315
There's no question about that.

06:40.474 --> 06:43.068
<i>NARRATOR:
Built in 1620,</i>

06:43.152 --> 06:46.479
<i>the</i> Nuestra Señora de la Pura
y Limpia Concepción

06:46.564 --> 06:48.490
<i>was a 600-ton galleon</i>

06:48.649 --> 06:50.742
<i>that served as the premier ship</i>

06:50.901 --> 06:53.078

06:56.749 --> 06:59.159
<i>But in 1641,</i>

06:59.243 --> 07:03.171
<i>while transporting more than
100 tons of silver and gold,</i>

07:03.256 --> 07:06.666
<i>the</i> Concepción<i> was sunk</i>
<i>by a massive hurricane</i>

07:06.750 --> 07:08.260
<i>off the northern coast
of Hispaniola,</i>

07:08.419 --> 07:10.846
<i>known today
as the Dominican Republic.</i>

07:11.005 --> 07:13.756
<i>The disaster led to the deaths</i>

07:13.841 --> 07:15.925
<i>of some 300 crew members</i>

07:16.018 --> 07:19.020
<i>and the loss
of the vast treasure.</i>

07:19.180 --> 07:21.931
<i>More than four decades later,</i>

07:22.024 --> 07:24.851
<i>Captain William Phips,

07:24.944 --> 07:27.946
<i>and treasure hunter from

07:28.030 --> 07:32.358
<i>embarked on a salvage mission

07:32.452 --> 07:35.278
<i>In January of 1687,</i>

07:35.362 --> 07:38.448

07:38.541 --> 07:41.960
<i>Utilizing
Indigenous free divers,</i>

07:42.119 --> 07:45.371
<i>it would mark the first
of perhaps several missions</i>

07:45.465 --> 07:48.717
<i>that Phips made to salvage
the sunken treasure galleon.</i>

07:48.801 --> 07:50.802
CLARKE: When it was
brought back to England,

07:50.961 --> 07:53.379
the treasure was weighed in
at over 34 tons

07:53.473 --> 07:56.049
and valued at about £205,000,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.977
which would be 50 million U.S.
dollars in today's currency.

08:00.804 --> 08:02.647
- That is remarkable.
- ALEX: Yeah.

08:02.806 --> 08:04.566
CLARKE: Uh, Phips
himself received £11,000

08:04.650 --> 08:06.902
or $2.7 million
in today's money.

08:07.061 --> 08:09.154
And Phips was knighted
by King James

08:09.238 --> 08:11.898
and treated as a hero in London.
It was very big news.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.327
Yeah. It was the recovery of
that treasure off the<i> Concepción</i>

08:15.486 --> 08:17.746
that actually bought his way
into higher society.

08:17.905 --> 08:19.748
- Phips, yeah. Yeah, and being knighted. Yeah.
- DOUG: Yeah.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.084
- CLARKE: Exactly.
- Wow. So he was pretty important.

08:23.244 --> 08:25.328
CLARKE:
Yeah. And this is about the time

08:25.412 --> 08:26.922
when Captain Andrew Belcher
comes into the picture.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.498
He was to become the assistant

08:28.582 --> 08:31.426
of the newly knighted
Sir William Phips.

08:31.585 --> 08:34.846
<i>NARRATOR: Captain Andrew
Belcher was a wealthy merchant</i>

08:35.005 --> 08:37.507
<i>and Freemason
from Cambridge, Massachusetts,</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:40.519
<i>who helped to shape
cooperative relations</i>

08:40.678 --> 08:43.855
<i>between the American colonists
and Indigenous tribes.</i>

08:43.940 --> 08:47.108
<i>However, according
to Scott Clarke's research,</i>

08:47.268 --> 08:49.936
<i>he also aided Sir William Phips</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:52.697
<i>in his subsequent efforts</i>
<i>to salvage the</i> Concepción.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.868
CLARKE:
So, in September 1687,

08:57.027 --> 08:59.037
Phips returned to the wreck
of the<i> Concepción.</i>

08:59.196 --> 09:01.540
And during the second expedition
of the treasure,

09:01.624 --> 09:03.542
Phips brought back to England,
was only valued

09:03.626 --> 09:05.535
at £10,000.

09:05.619 --> 09:08.204
He literally found 1/20
of what he found the first time.

09:08.289 --> 09:10.298
DOUG: He came back
with less than expected,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.217
- right? Yeah.
- CLARKE: Much less. Yeah. Yeah.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.626
And he was there
for eight months.

09:13.711 --> 09:14.970
He was there a long time,

09:15.129 --> 09:16.304
so they were expecting more.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.974
- Right.
- CLARKE: Okay. So, um,

09:19.058 --> 09:20.550
this is where
my first discovery comes in.

09:20.634 --> 09:23.228
I basically found a 1688 letter

09:23.312 --> 09:25.638
that shows
that Captain Andrew Belcher

09:25.723 --> 09:27.816
was caught
with one of Phips's ships

09:27.900 --> 09:29.892
in the Mahone Bay area

09:29.977 --> 09:31.653
at the exact time
that Phips was coming back

09:31.812 --> 09:33.396
from the second attempt,
where he

09:33.480 --> 09:35.315
"allegedly," officially,
did not find as much silver.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.899
The letter also states

09:36.993 --> 09:38.994
that they burnt the ship
at Port L'Hebert,

09:39.078 --> 09:41.079
which is very close
to Oak Island.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.248
I strongly believe

09:43.407 --> 09:44.833
that Belcher and his comrades
were actually

09:44.917 --> 09:46.334
transferring treasure
from the<i> Concepción</i>

09:46.493 --> 09:48.086
to be taken to Nova Scotia.

09:49.747 --> 09:52.749
So, this brings me
to my second discovery,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.500
which I think
is the most interesting.

09:54.585 --> 09:58.671
I discovered
this, uh, map from 1701.

09:58.756 --> 10:00.506
Basically, I've discovered
a literal treasure map

10:00.600 --> 10:02.008
created 320 years ago

10:02.101 --> 10:04.260
that strongly appears
to tie the<i> Concepción</i> treasure

10:04.345 --> 10:05.770
to the Oak Island area.

10:07.014 --> 10:07.731
Wow.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.353
I find that interesting.

10:13.437 --> 10:15.196
<i>NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island war room,</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:17.106
<i>theorist Scott Clarke
is presenting his research</i>

10:17.191 --> 10:19.534
<i>that the English nobleman
Sir William Phips</i>

10:19.619 --> 10:22.862
<i>may have transported
a vast cache of Spanish silver</i>

10:22.946 --> 10:26.374
<i>to Oak Island sometime
in the late 17th century.</i>

10:26.533 --> 10:28.543
<i>Silver that was salvaged</i>

10:28.702 --> 10:32.538
<i>from the famed treasure wreck</i>
<i>known as the</i> Concepción.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.626
So, the map is titled
"The English Empire in America."

10:36.710 --> 10:39.379
It was published
in an 1853 book that I own.

10:39.463 --> 10:42.715
Newfoundland, Canada,
Hudson's Bay and Colonies.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.884
<i>It was created by Herman Moll,</i>

10:44.968 --> 10:47.395
<i>published 13 years
after Phips's 1688 voyage</i>

10:47.554 --> 10:49.222
<i>to the</i> Concepción<i> site.</i>

10:49.306 --> 10:51.057
Aside from being
an excellent, prolific mapmaker,

10:51.141 --> 10:53.902
Herman Moll was known
for his interesting circle

10:53.986 --> 10:56.655
of merchants, seafaring men
and intellectual friends.

10:56.814 --> 10:58.731
It is written
that from these friends of Moll,

10:58.824 --> 11:00.992
uh, Moll gained a fair bit
of privileged information

11:01.077 --> 11:03.411
that was sometimes
later conveyed on his maps.

11:03.570 --> 11:05.822
<i>I believe that's exactly what
occurred on this particular map.</i>

11:05.906 --> 11:07.907
<i>Overall, the map seems normal</i>

11:08.000 --> 11:10.410
<i>except for two
very interesting additions.</i>

11:10.494 --> 11:13.672
It specifically shows the wreck
of the<i> Concepción</i> on the map.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.676
The specific location
of the<i> Concepción</i> shipwreck

11:17.835 --> 11:21.012
<i>is labeled
"Sir William Phips Plate Rack."</i>

11:21.097 --> 11:23.089
So, "plate"
specifically meant silver

11:23.173 --> 11:25.517
and was derived
from the Spanish word<i> "plata,"</i>

11:25.601 --> 11:28.094
and "rack" was an
old-fashioned term for "wreck."

11:28.178 --> 11:29.762
The second anomaly
is especially interesting.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.272
<i>In New Scotland,</i>

11:31.357 --> 11:34.100
<i>along with the usually labeled
Port-Royal and LaHave,</i>

11:34.184 --> 11:36.861
<i>Moll has added La Plata.</i>

11:36.946 --> 11:40.273
<i>Like, he literally named it
La Plata, "the silver."</i>

11:40.357 --> 11:42.867
- That's right where Oak Island is.
- CLARKE: Exactly.

11:43.026 --> 11:44.360
<i>When you look
at the-the modern map,</i>

11:44.445 --> 11:47.363
<i>La Plata, it almost certainly is
in Mahone Bay area.</i>

11:47.456 --> 11:49.365
<i>RICK:
That is remarkable.</i>

11:49.450 --> 11:52.368
<i>NARRATOR:

11:52.453 --> 11:54.871

11:57.383 --> 11:59.208
<i>where Oak Island is located</i>

11:59.293 --> 12:02.128
<i>as "La Plata" or "the silver"?</i>

12:02.212 --> 12:05.131
You'd think they'd label it
"the gold" for "gold river,"

12:05.215 --> 12:06.725
but that's the silver for...

12:06.809 --> 12:08.226
He specifically mentions
"the silver."

12:08.385 --> 12:09.635
-So, why would he do... why would he that?
-JACK: Yeah.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.888
<i>NARRATOR:
Could Scott Clarke be correct</i>

12:11.972 --> 12:14.474
<i>that he has found
an actual treasure map</i>

12:14.558 --> 12:17.643
<i>made prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit</i>

12:17.728 --> 12:20.897
<i>connecting Sir William Phips
and the vast silver treasure</i>

12:20.981 --> 12:22.907
<i>to the Oak Island mystery?</i>

12:22.992 --> 12:27.078
<i>If so, could that explain
the high levels of silver</i>

12:27.237 --> 12:28.988
<i>that the team
has recently detected</i>

12:29.072 --> 12:31.657
<i>in the Money Pit area?</i>

12:31.742 --> 12:33.918
- Wow.
- CLARKE: So, Captain Andrew Belcher

12:34.003 --> 12:35.244
was intimately connected

12:35.337 --> 12:37.172
with Sir William Phips.
So, basically,

12:37.256 --> 12:39.665
the accomplice that Phips had,
it's Captain Andrew Belcher.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.751
DOUG:
Wow.

12:41.835 --> 12:43.845
RICK:
Wow. That's very interesting.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.347
<i>CLARKE: He was one of the most
connected men in-in New England.</i>

12:46.507 --> 12:48.090
<i>He-he owned 20 ships.</i>

12:48.175 --> 12:49.258
He had a vast shipping network.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.603
His son was the first
American-born Freemason.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.772
So, they were
the highest Freemasons.

12:53.856 --> 12:54.856
They were the governors.

12:55.015 --> 12:56.733
They were directly tied
to Oak Island.

12:58.694 --> 13:02.530
<i>NARRATOR: From the beginning
of the hunt for treasure on Oak Island,</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:06.108

<i>Not only have Masonic symbols--</i>

<i>which curiously descended

<i>just revealed

13:34.396 --> 13:36.981
<i>has been so prevalent

13:37.140 --> 13:39.818
<i>and also
what they were looking for?</i>

13:39.902 --> 13:42.311
I think
because Captain Andrew Belcher

13:42.396 --> 13:46.491
now has arisen to, certainly,
a person of interest,

13:46.575 --> 13:49.318
<i>we need to dedicate some assets

<i>and that may lead us somewhere.</i>

13:58.420 --> 14:00.088
I like it
because you have treasure

14:00.247 --> 14:01.673
and you have people

14:01.832 --> 14:04.000
and you have Oak Island
all tied together.

14:04.084 --> 14:05.510
Whereas a lot of times, we have

14:05.669 --> 14:07.169
the theory of treasure
and the people

14:07.254 --> 14:08.671
who could have done it,
but the tie to Oak Island

14:08.764 --> 14:10.423
- is a little sketchy.
- Right.

<i>and the 14th-century lead cross

<i>of an existing Templar

Oak Island was a repository,

perhaps over generations

28:23.952 --> 28:26.111
<i>by multiple people.</i>

a treasure here on Oak Island.</i>

28:44.389 --> 28:46.056
Small.

See, that's more the size
of what I was thinking of

28:48.301 --> 28:49.727
as a treasure chest, because...

28:51.813 --> 28:52.896
It'd be heavy.

28:53.055 --> 28:54.231
Right.

28:54.315 --> 28:57.234
ALEX: But it-it's on
an area of the island

28:57.318 --> 29:00.395

happened there,

29:00.488 --> 29:02.656

29:09.322 --> 29:10.914
DAVID F.:

30:24.146 --> 30:26.565
- Yeah.
- Okay. So, let's say I'm wrong

30:26.658 --> 30:30.661
about the possibility
that there's an offset chamber.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.746
What argues against that
is it seems

30:32.831 --> 30:34.915
like we'd have
more air, then, right?

30:34.999 --> 30:36.667
If it filled up
an entire chamber.

30:36.751 --> 30:38.669
- Right.
- Yeah.

30:38.828 --> 30:40.412
You know I've been
a flood tunnel doubter...

30:40.496 --> 30:41.505
- CRAIG: Mm-hmm.
- forever,

30:41.589 --> 30:44.091
but maybe the flood tunnel
does exist.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.500
Right.

30:45.585 --> 30:48.512
<i>NARRATOR:
One week ago,</i>

30:48.596 --> 30:50.097
<i>when the team drilled
into the mysterious</i>

30:50.181 --> 30:52.933
<i>air-filled void
some 70 feet deep</i>

30:53.092 --> 30:54.759

30:54.844 --> 30:56.520
TERRY:
What the heck?

30:56.679 --> 30:59.690
<i>they made
a surprising discovery.</i>

30:59.774 --> 31:01.358
TERRY:
It almost looks like grass,

31:01.517 --> 31:03.360
maybe eelgrass or something
washing in.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.615
<i>NARRATOR: Eelgrass,
along with coconut fiber,</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:12.444
<i>was discovered in 1850
at Smith's Cove.</i>

31:12.528 --> 31:16.290
<i>These materials were covering
five stone box drains,</i>

31:16.374 --> 31:19.042
<i>and were believed to be acting
as a kind of filter</i>

31:19.127 --> 31:22.704
<i>to keep debris
out of a man-made flood tunnel.</i>

31:22.788 --> 31:27.125
<i>A flood tunnel feeding seawater
directly into the Money Pit.</i>

31:27.209 --> 31:29.294
I mean, if you guys don't mind,

31:29.378 --> 31:31.880
I'm gonna draw you what I think
may be, as a possibility...

31:31.964 --> 31:34.633
- Sure.
- and then you tell me if I'm crazy or not.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.227
MARTY: Okay, we got
the elephant's nose, right?

31:38.638 --> 31:39.730
Yeah...

31:39.889 --> 31:42.641
Tell me if I'm about right,
Money Pit-ish?

31:42.725 --> 31:44.484
- Yep.
- Smith's Cove,

31:44.569 --> 31:46.737
here's our cofferdam.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.898
If there was a flood tunnel,
it would've gone more or less

31:49.991 --> 31:51.733
the shortest distance, right?

31:51.817 --> 31:53.160
- Mm-hmm.
- And I believe

31:53.244 --> 31:54.903
there's the Cave-In Pit.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.239
Okay, if I do an elevation view,

31:58.324 --> 32:01.159
here's sea level
in Smith's Cove,

32:01.243 --> 32:03.078
here's the Money Pit, original.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.504
And let's say the flood tunnel

32:04.589 --> 32:07.499
comes in down here
somewhere, right?

32:07.583 --> 32:10.761
Okay, so let's say,
when they dug this flood tunnel,

32:10.845 --> 32:15.098
all they would've had to do
is have a bump in it like that.

32:15.257 --> 32:17.008
You know,
either intentionally, boulder,

32:17.093 --> 32:18.185
for whatever reason you want.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.353
This wouldn't have interfered

32:19.512 --> 32:21.939
with its ability
to function at all, right?

32:22.098 --> 32:23.190
No.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.608
- Mm.
- MARTY: No. Okay.

32:24.767 --> 32:27.694
Over the years,
we put all kinds of air

32:27.779 --> 32:29.020
down here, right?

32:29.105 --> 32:30.438
We drilled all kinds of holes.

32:30.523 --> 32:32.607
Now, if that air
happened to find its way

32:32.692 --> 32:35.702
into this flood tunnel,
it would work its way up

32:35.861 --> 32:39.781
and get caught right there just
like a little bubble in a level.

32:39.865 --> 32:42.450
And this would be an obvious
place for introduced gas

32:42.535 --> 32:44.127
to try and find
its way out, right?

32:44.212 --> 32:45.620
If there's still something
that exists.

32:45.705 --> 32:47.130
I mean, it's just,
it's just perfect.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.208
It'd start working its way up
and get trapped right there.

32:50.301 --> 32:54.796
So, here we come along and we
just drilled into that, perhaps.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.716
- That's my theory.
- Hmm.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.143
<i>MARTY: If the flood
tunnel came from the shore,</i>

33:00.228 --> 33:03.555
it wouldn't necessarily
come down perfectly, would it?

33:03.639 --> 33:06.141
<i>Let's say it was constructed,
they had to go up and over</i>

33:06.225 --> 33:08.652
<i>a rock, whatever,
any number of reasons.</i>

33:08.736 --> 33:11.563
<i>And if it has
just a little bow in it,</i>

33:11.647 --> 33:14.232
<i>that would be a perfect place
to catch air.</i>

33:14.325 --> 33:18.236
We introduced a lot of air
into the Money Pit area

33:18.320 --> 33:20.572
when we were drilling with air
several years ago.

33:20.656 --> 33:23.074
<i>That air, if there is
a flood tunnel,</i>

33:23.167 --> 33:25.168
<i>could've encountered it,
it would've went straight up.</i>

33:25.253 --> 33:26.327
<i>When it got
to that little bubble,</i>

33:26.412 --> 33:27.996
<i>it would've gotten trapped</i>

33:28.080 --> 33:29.923
<i>and it would've been
under pressure.</i>

33:30.008 --> 33:32.175
<i>NARRATOR:
Could Marty be correct</i>

33:32.334 --> 33:33.927
<i>that the team's
drilling operations</i>

33:34.012 --> 33:36.087
<i>over the past several years</i>

33:36.172 --> 33:39.266
<i>caused air to be trapped
in a man-made flood tunnel?</i>

33:39.425 --> 33:41.092
<i>A flood tunnel connected</i>

33:41.177 --> 33:43.353
<i>to the legendary
Money Pit treasure vault?</i>

33:45.606 --> 33:47.274
I'm more of a believer
after all that,

33:47.358 --> 33:49.109
that the flood tunnel
does exist.

33:49.268 --> 33:51.102
Maybe we just found it.

33:51.187 --> 33:52.362
I think that's very reasonable.

33:52.521 --> 33:54.272
It's certainly one
of the more interesting spots

33:54.356 --> 33:55.940
that we've drilled into
in the Money Pit.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.359
MARTY: And it's about the
only thing I can think of, honestly,

33:58.444 --> 34:01.121
- that would be just designed to catch air.
- Yeah.

34:01.205 --> 34:04.115

34:04.200 --> 34:06.451

34:19.799 --> 34:22.142
The difficulties in the Money
Pit have always have been

34:22.226 --> 34:26.313
associated with water flooding
in from a possible flood tunnel.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.816
<i>If we can find a tunnel
and block the ocean water,</i>

34:29.901 --> 34:31.902

34:32.061 --> 34:34.654
Do we have enough time
for one more hole?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.231
I would think so.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.324
- I think so, yeah.
- MARTY: Okay.

34:37.483 --> 34:38.399
Sounds like a plan.

34:38.484 --> 34:40.243

- Oh.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.868
PETER:
Gary, what do you make of this?

35:29.952 --> 35:31.545
Oh, yeah.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.881
That looks like a-a square hole.

35:34.966 --> 35:38.293
Oh, that's interesting, mate,
'cause older fasteners,

35:38.377 --> 35:40.879
especially iron,
were square-shanked.

35:40.963 --> 35:43.882
We haven't found that many
pieces of wood with holes in.

35:43.966 --> 35:46.726
So, do you think that's marine?

35:46.811 --> 35:49.479
Yeah, I mean,
we're right at the side

35:49.564 --> 35:51.898
to the southeast corner
of the swamp,

35:51.983 --> 35:54.893
we're looking for,
potentially, a ship.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.071
That's the type of find
you want to be pulling up,

35:58.230 --> 36:00.490
wood with square holes in.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.493
Circular-shanked fasteners

36:03.652 --> 36:06.496
came in round about
the early 1700s,

36:06.581 --> 36:09.249
and then
in the Industrial Revolution,

36:09.333 --> 36:10.992
everything was round.

36:11.076 --> 36:13.661
So it could possibly
be earlier than the 1700s.

36:13.746 --> 36:15.079
Oh, yeah.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.832
Yeah, that's actually
the date range I'd put it in,

36:17.917 --> 36:21.261
um, mid-1500s to mid-1700s,

36:21.345 --> 36:23.597

I wish I could reach

37:11.804 --> 37:14.397
for my top pocket, but...

37:14.556 --> 37:17.058
the lack of metal's
a little bit frustrating.

37:17.142 --> 37:18.902

some intriguing things.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.812
So, we found some
interesting things here,

37:20.905 --> 37:23.064
but obviously there's still more
on the search agenda,

37:23.157 --> 37:24.658
so I'd be curious
what-what's next.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.401
MARTY:
Well,

37:26.485 --> 37:27.994
the reason Rick and I
are here is--

37:28.079 --> 37:31.081
I mean, we found
all kinds of neat stuff.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.157
You've done a great job,

37:33.242 --> 37:36.419
um, but for this year,
we're wrapping it up.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.169
But we got cannisters coming,

37:45.263 --> 37:49.340
and, uh, we need the water so
we can use it at the wash plant.

37:49.425 --> 37:52.352
So, I think we're running
out of time in the swamp.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.688
- That's frustrating.
- PETER: Yeah.

- (laughter) - This is a
place we're coming back to.

39:51.722 --> 39:55.141
<i>MARTY: If you look at the
percentage of the swamp we've dug,</i>

39:55.300 --> 39:57.135
<i>even though we've done
a lot of digging in the swamp,</i>

39:57.219 --> 40:00.304
<i>I'd say percentagewise,
certainly single digits.</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:02.306
<i>Five percent, maybe.</i>

40:02.391 --> 40:05.485
And every time,
I believe without fail,

40:05.569 --> 40:09.823
every time, it's-it's yielded
interesting things.

40:09.982 --> 40:12.575
<i>RICK:
I don't know, necessarily,</i>

40:12.734 --> 40:15.736
<i>that there's a treasure
component to the swamp,</i>

40:15.830 --> 40:18.489
<i>but I do believe that
there's more information</i>

40:18.574 --> 40:20.575
in the body of the swamp.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.420
And so, I don't think
we're done yet.

40:23.579 --> 40:25.839
Before we go, I do want
to get to that area

40:25.998 --> 40:27.582
where the railing came from.

40:27.666 --> 40:29.083
- Right.
- How close are you?

40:29.176 --> 40:31.719
We're basically
right on top of that now.

40:33.172 --> 40:35.089
Okay. Well, let's finish up,

40:35.182 --> 40:36.182
because we're running
out of time

40:36.341 --> 40:37.842
and we've got big work
to do up there.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.844
- Yeah.
- You guys ready?

40:39.937 --> 40:41.679
- I'm ready for that.
- Yep. We're ready. - All right.

40:41.763 --> 40:44.098
-Let's finish up here.
-DAVID F.: All right. Sounds good.

40:44.183 --> 40:48.945
<i>NARRATOR: If Rick, Marty and their
team can now be certain of anything,</i>

40:49.104 --> 40:52.782
<i>it is that answers surrounding
a 227-year-old mystery</i>

40:52.941 --> 40:57.028
<i>could be revealed anywhere
across Oak Island.</i>

40:57.121 --> 40:59.038
<i>But even though they must soon
suspend their search</i>

40:59.198 --> 41:02.542
<i>in the swamp, where evidence
of an incredible secret</i>

41:02.701 --> 41:05.295
<i>has been unearthed, it will aid</i>

41:05.454 --> 41:08.965
<i>their most historic dig
ever conducted in the Money Pit.</i>

41:09.049 --> 41:12.793
<i>There, they have found
scientific evidence</i>

41:12.878 --> 41:17.307
<i>of just what
that incredible secret could be.</i>

41:19.468 --> 41:22.053
<i>Next time</i>
<i>on</i> The Curse of Oak Island...

41:22.137 --> 41:23.971
BRENNAN: Looks like
we got something, boys.

41:24.064 --> 41:25.640
- Three pieces of wood.
- TERRY: The only thing,

41:25.724 --> 41:28.151
usually, that will give us that
is a tunnel.

41:28.310 --> 41:31.070
- So, we ran C-14 on it.
- CRAIG: One time frame.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.647
Old, old, old.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.232
- (laughter)
- (horn honks)

41:34.316 --> 41:35.325
<i>MARTY:
We are about to embark</i>

41:35.409 --> 41:37.985
<i>on the attempt
to recover valuables</i>

41:38.070 --> 41:40.079
<i>- lurking in the Money Pit.</i>
- DAN H.: Here they come.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.581
<i>MARTY:
We've got ten-foot cans</i>

41:41.740 --> 41:43.249
<i>coming in and we can dig it up.</i>

41:43.408 --> 41:45.752
There is definitely,
without a doubt,

41:45.911 --> 41:47.328
- gold down there.
- (laughs)
