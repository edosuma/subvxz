01:43.582 --> 01:46.707
What are you doing?
-Watching <i>High Noon</i> ?

01:46.885 --> 01:49.205
No, no. No, no. Why aren't you working?

01:50.636 --> 01:52.361
I hate clowns.

01:52.397 --> 01:54.002
Yeah, lots of people hate clowns.

01:54.038 --> 01:57.243
You're being paid to complete
an autopsy of one by 5pm.

01:57.324 --> 01:59.765
Let Fairley do it.
-You're doing it.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.445
No, I'm not.
-Daniel, the police need it by today.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.451
There are people of interest
who are a flight risk,

02:05.487 --> 02:07.685
because, ta-da., this looks like murder.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.285
Great.
-Not great. I need to know if it is.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.743
Give it to Fairley.
-I gave it to you.

02:12.779 --> 02:14.344
I'm not doing it.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.245
Do you think I don't
know who this guy is?

02:16.280 --> 02:19.152
Accusations of child molestation.
But none that have stuck.

02:19.188 --> 02:22.333
Now that he's dead, the police are
thinking one of his victims grew up,

02:22.369 --> 02:25.325
tracked him down, surprised him
on his yoga mat and broke his neck.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.285
Then why aren't you doing the autopsy?

02:27.320 --> 02:29.565
Because if I do it, I'll
find that cause of death

02:29.600 --> 02:31.525
is a subarachnoid haemorrhage
on the base of the brain

02:31.560 --> 02:33.805
as a result of traumatic
medial laceration

02:33.840 --> 02:35.125
of the right vertebral artery

02:35.160 --> 02:38.060
by excessive auto-rotation
of the C2 and C3 vertebrae.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.405
He died twisting his neck

02:40.440 --> 02:42.571
doing yoga in his make-up.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.645
Wearing it because it brought back
sweet memories of the tender moments

02:45.680 --> 02:47.285
he spent with all those children

02:47.320 --> 02:48.725
whose lives he destroyed,

02:48.760 --> 02:50.205
hence the angel lust.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.005
You want it done, give to Fairley.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.165
With a bit of luck, he might
suggest blunt-force trauma,

02:54.200 --> 02:55.645
the police will investigate

02:55.680 --> 02:57.445
and then enough dirt will
come up on this shithead

02:57.480 --> 03:00.600
that he'll be remembered as
a child molester instead of a clown.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.440
You really shouldn't interrupt
a guy watching <i>High Noon</i>.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.380
Fairley's finished your clown.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.005
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you?

03:20.040 --> 03:21.485
Vocabulary.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.869
I have the most arcipluvian
way with words.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.325
You quit years ago.
-I know.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.645
It's hard to start again.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.045
They say it's easy
but, I tell you, it takes willpower.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.760
Knock yourself out.

03:36.369 --> 03:38.643
You told Fairley about the yoga.

03:38.825 --> 03:40.110
Yes.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.245
He might have come to
a different conclusion.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.845
Now that grease-painted prick
gets away with it by dying.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.108
It was the truth.

03:47.212 --> 03:50.525
You know what? You should fire me,
before I get us both into trouble.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.405
Yeah, I should.
But what good would it do?

03:52.441 --> 03:55.232
You'd still be in that exam room,
working. You love it too much.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.953
So, what happens the next time
I find something that I don't like?

03:57.989 --> 04:00.549
You watch Gary Cooper
and you tell the truth.

04:01.519 --> 04:04.416
But if you fail to do your job,
I will dock your pay,

04:04.452 --> 04:06.005
so get back to work.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.600
And apologise to Fairley.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.606
Fairley?

04:18.641 --> 04:21.084
You're here to apologise?
. Yeah.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.200
Because you want to or
because Pavich told you to?

04:25.551 --> 04:27.162
Thanks to you,

04:27.867 --> 04:30.208
I'm late for my kodo class.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.805
Kodo.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.125
The Japanese art of
incense appreciation.

04:42.054 --> 04:44.734
You were right.
-Yeah.

04:46.215 --> 04:47.575
You OK?

04:48.380 --> 04:49.665
Yeah.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.840
Harrow.

04:58.949 --> 05:00.794
Has your daughter taken drugs before?

05:00.830 --> 05:02.955
Not that I'm aware of.
What was it she took?

05:02.991 --> 05:07.045
First symptoms suggest some sort
of psychoactive, like MDMA.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.725
But she's responded well.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.405
How did she get here?
-She was left outside by someone.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.085
They didn't stick around.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.560
She's just in here.

05:19.469 --> 05:20.989
Fern?.

05:21.961 --> 05:23.686
Fern.

05:24.246 --> 05:26.086
Fern, wait.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.805
Not a great time.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.892
Sorry. Is Fern there?

05:40.928 --> 05:42.733
Ha. No.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.445
Has she called?
-Using her actual voice?

05:45.481 --> 05:49.166
She sent me a text, like,
a week ago, saying she's fine.

05:49.202 --> 05:51.245
Why? What's happened?

05:51.280 --> 05:53.965
She was admitted to Emergency.
She took something.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.485
When?
-A party drug.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.125
But she was OK.
-Which hospital?

05:57.160 --> 05:59.165
Is she OK? Did you see her?

05:59.311 --> 06:01.151
She left before I got there.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.080
What do we do?
-I don't know.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.320
Just let me know if you talk to her.

06:48.023 --> 06:49.907
Do you know who I am?

06:50.359 --> 06:51.493
Yeah.

06:51.822 --> 06:53.302
Bruce Reimers.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.820
Not sure why you're here?

06:57.040 --> 06:59.285
Get bored of hassling Fairley?

06:59.320 --> 07:01.080
Fairley's an idiot.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.392
He's not.

07:05.037 --> 07:07.845
Though he does spend more than
a hundred bucks on a haircut.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.805
Drink?
-Sure.

07:10.101 --> 07:11.581
Tough shit.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.845
I don't drink with people
who break into Bettie.

07:15.023 --> 07:16.703
What do you want, Reimers?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.325
It's from your boss.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.885
If I don't collect Livvy's body
by the end of the week,

07:23.920 --> 07:26.240
the state will cremate her.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.765
End of the week?

07:30.800 --> 07:33.805
Well, you better...
-No. No.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.925
The case is closed.
-Reopen it.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.965
Reimers, your daughter wasn't murdered.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.485
She was murdered.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.285
Olivia didn't kill herself.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.045
Your idiot mate, Fairley, got it wrong.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.445
Hey, I don't like Fairley
any more than you.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.525
But he is thorough.
-Well, he missed something.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.780
No.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.645
You gonna shoot me?

07:54.711 --> 07:57.534
Dead pathologists do shitty autopsies.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.245
Whoa. Not Bettie.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.605
Whoa...

08:02.640 --> 08:04.421
Livvy was murdered.

08:04.457 --> 08:06.165
Look, I'm sorry.

08:06.201 --> 08:08.478
You get what everyone else gets.
You get the system.

08:08.514 --> 08:11.165
The system that looks at everything
and makes a decision.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.605
And the system decided your
daughter wasn't murdered.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.125
Hey.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.565
You, a part of the system,
can change it.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.325
Just because you don't like the answers

08:20.360 --> 08:22.165
doesn't mean you get special privileges.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.885
Trust me, I know.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.325
You can threaten me, you can hit me,

08:26.360 --> 08:28.685
you can even shoot Bettie if you want,

08:28.720 --> 08:30.960
but I can't change the system.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.260
You say that.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.539
But you have a daughter, right?

08:43.400 --> 08:45.120
You get to see her again.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.520
I never will.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.005
Fern.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.365
You know you can get new shears
from Bunnings for, like, $10.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.885
You don't get these at Bunnings.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.605
This is an 1870 surgeon's kit
by Mathieu of Paris.

09:20.887 --> 09:22.532
How do you know?

09:22.568 --> 09:23.965
I read the box.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.525
Google it.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.245
OK, maybe you don't sell it
to street traffic,

09:28.280 --> 09:31.525
but auction online, three grand, easy.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.045
Tell you what, 100 bucks.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.564
900.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
200.

09:42.901 --> 09:43.941
600.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.816
300.

09:45.841 --> 09:47.565
Five.
-500.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.445
They're worth over three grand.

09:49.654 --> 09:51.694
350.
-Done.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.885
You're quick.
-You were lazy.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.325
This is the closest pawn shop.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.405
Next time, I'll go further. Goodnight.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.445
You OK?
-I'm fine.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.285
You were on a hospital drip
two hours ago.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.165
What was it you took?
Are you gonna take more?

10:05.200 --> 10:07.925
Not right at this second.
-Your mother's worried sick.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.365
Yeah, I got that from the 500
voicemails she left this afternoon.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.885
Thanks for telling her.
-Well, what do you expect?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.605
You disappear for the
best part of a year?

10:15.640 --> 10:17.405
I keep in touch.
-Text messages.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.005
"I'm alive, I'm fine."

10:19.040 --> 10:20.864
You think that's enough?
-Has to be.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.165
You could have died today.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.680
It's my life.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.565
Bub, we need to talk.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.205
We really don't.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.685
There's something I have to tell you.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.285
I'm going now.
-I'll follow you.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.000
You do that, and I swear, you
won't see me for another year.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.240
What if I quit?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.245
You couldn't leave work for two
days straight, let alone...

10:42.280 --> 10:43.627
But what if I did?

10:43.705 --> 10:47.670
What if I quit and me and you,
we sail to Bora Bora.

10:48.263 --> 10:50.708
Very Brando. Pack fat clothes.

10:50.744 --> 10:51.925
I mean it.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.160
What, and you and me sit on the
sand and play our guitars?

10:55.900 --> 10:57.220
Yeah.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.525
Why now?
-You need me.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.245
I don't need anyone.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.925
Look, I should have tried harder,
I should have quit sooner

11:06.960 --> 11:08.600
and I would have if I...

11:10.440 --> 11:11.845
Listen.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.885
There's a good westerly coming Friday.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.600
Enough time for me to get Bettie
tidied up. Come with me.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.225
Friday. Just say it.

11:22.261 --> 11:23.581
Friday.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.360
Friday.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.000
Alright.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.325
What's this gonna cost me?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.926
Well, let's see.

11:54.788 --> 11:57.988
Kind of early for drinking,
isn't it? Even for you.

11:58.473 --> 12:00.118
Do you remember our bet?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.085
That you'd outstay me in this job.

12:02.350 --> 12:03.590
Losers pay.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.765
I thought we talked about your
crisis of conscience yesterday.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.445
Come on. You've said you're
quitting hundreds of times.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.040
Yes, but I've never typed it.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.845
If this is about the pay scale,
there is nothing I can do.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.325
It's not.
-If you need counselling...

12:20.360 --> 12:21.528
It's Fern.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.965
You found her?
-She was taken to hospital.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.525
She's OK, this time.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.285
Take some time off like you did last
time when you were looking for her.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.485
I promised, we're going away.

12:31.931 --> 12:34.576
Your contract stipulates
two weeks' notice.

12:34.612 --> 12:36.372
Then you'll have to sue me.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.520
I quit.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.729
So...

12:55.765 --> 12:57.641
it's true.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.042
Yes.

12:59.477 --> 13:01.041
It's true.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.005
I stole your penis.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.925
But you can have it back.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.845
You know, I'm going to like this office.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.685
Fairley, you already have an office.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.885
But I want this one.

13:13.102 --> 13:14.902
Aren't you gonna ask me why I quit?

13:15.362 --> 13:16.762
Nope.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.200
In that case...

13:20.960 --> 13:22.965
you can have your Yamazaki back too.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.605
Don't get gay germs all over Gregory.

13:31.641 --> 13:33.961
I thought real men gave
their cars girl's names.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.621
You see, it's started already.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.660
Were you gonna tell me?

13:41.740 --> 13:43.585
You know Fairley wants me to assist him.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.602
Fairley already has an assistant.

13:45.638 --> 13:47.358
Fairley already has an office.

13:51.751 --> 13:54.271
I can't learn anything from him.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.205
Now, Simon, you know

13:58.240 --> 14:00.965
I've never expressed any interest
in your sexual proclivity.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.885
You put shit on me
50 times a day, alright?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.485
Working with you, it's like competing

14:04.520 --> 14:06.285
in the Olympics of sexual harassment.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.325
OK, be that as it may,
you have someone special.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.792
What's his name? Vivian?
-David.

14:10.828 --> 14:13.285
We've invited you to our place
a... dozen times.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.885
Don't worry about the work.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.245
You're not stupid. You'll
learn what you need to.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.360
Worry about spending time with David.

14:23.294 --> 14:25.528
The living are more important
than the dead.

15:37.584 --> 15:39.213
What are you doing here?

15:39.517 --> 15:42.336
I said I couldn't help while
I was part of the system.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.291
Your daughter's place?

15:54.280 --> 15:55.805
You've been paying the rent?

15:56.102 --> 15:57.902
For the last 14 months.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.255
I had to sell my place.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.698
That's why I'm renting
that shit box at Moorooka.

16:03.734 --> 16:06.922
You haven't been working?
-I can't work. Who could work?

16:20.577 --> 16:21.983
Did you find her?

16:23.080 --> 16:25.045
We were going to have dinner.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.880
But she was late, so I came here.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.916
That's where she hit her head?
-No.

16:32.952 --> 16:34.996
That's where her head was hit.

16:35.617 --> 16:37.404
But wasn't she...?
-Drunk?

16:37.643 --> 16:39.245
Yes.

16:39.847 --> 16:42.245
0.12 blood alcohol level

16:42.280 --> 16:44.405
and an overdose of Amitriptyline.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.036
But listen to me.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.725
She'd stopped drinking and she
was off her antidepressants.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.205
Clearly, she wasn't.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.445
I'm telling you, she was.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.005
People can take pills and
forget that they've taken them

16:56.040 --> 16:57.605
and then they take more.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.765
And those tricyclic antidepressants
can cause cardiac arrhythmia.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.685
The pills didn't kill her.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.560
That did.

17:05.278 --> 17:07.443
Intra...
-Intraparenchymal haematoma.

17:07.479 --> 17:09.003
Look, if he she slipped and hit her...

17:09.040 --> 17:10.480
She didn't slip.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.400
She'd stopped drinking.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.565
She was off her meds.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.244
This was no accident.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.200
You think it was her fiance?

17:23.040 --> 17:25.285
Kurt Callana wasn't even charged.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.525
He has no motive...
-Bullshit.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.389
He killed her.

17:30.401 --> 17:31.710
He did it.

17:32.201 --> 17:34.825
And I can prove it. Here.

17:40.919 --> 17:43.445
"K-U." "Kurt."

17:43.780 --> 17:45.820
That's what she was trying to tell us.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.200
Fern?

18:12.820 --> 18:14.620
Are you OK?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.605
I'm fine.

18:18.845 --> 18:20.570
You were in hospital.

18:20.606 --> 18:22.606
Are you alright? What happened?

18:23.880 --> 18:25.685
Where are you staying?

18:25.720 --> 18:27.405
I've been so worried about you.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.880
So was your dad. He...

18:30.680 --> 18:34.270
We don't know where you are? We don't
know if you're hurt or sick or...

18:34.737 --> 18:37.022
Sweetie, we're just trying to help, OK.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.480
Don't. OK?

18:40.080 --> 18:41.780
Why won't you talk to me?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.080
Where's my passport?

18:47.043 --> 18:49.543
_

18:50.376 --> 18:52.221
Morning.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.800
Cindy.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.360
Hello.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.406
"Big... wanker."

19:05.919 --> 19:07.519
_

19:18.520 --> 19:20.285
Is that Olivia Reimers?

19:20.320 --> 19:21.765
What did you find under her nails?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.080
Nothing. What are you doing?

19:24.116 --> 19:25.925
"Nothing", nothing,
or nothing significant?

19:25.960 --> 19:27.605
"Nothing", nothing.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.525
You quit.
-So, no tissue from Kurt Callana.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.960
You. Exam room two. You're still mine.

19:38.660 --> 19:41.045
So, how's retirement?
-Awesome.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.125
Looks a lot like work, only with no pay.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.925
To the untrained eye.
-You trained me.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.805
Yeah, well no-one's perfect.

19:48.006 --> 19:49.771
Look at her right lower jaw.

19:49.928 --> 19:52.853
Could that be a pressure contusion
from say a thumb?

19:52.889 --> 19:53.889
Yeah.

19:54.237 --> 19:55.642
Or a tennis ball.

19:55.741 --> 19:57.346
Or a car door.
-Shut up.

19:57.382 --> 19:58.685
Or bumping into a stranger
in a supermarket aisle

19:58.720 --> 20:00.417
or slapping a mosquito.
-Seriously, shut up.

20:00.453 --> 20:01.645
Pretty much anything,

20:01.680 --> 20:04.018
including hitting the ground
after that happened.

20:04.951 --> 20:06.965
She's frozen.
-I know.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.905
You won't find anything until she thaws.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.523
I know.
-And that could take a few days.

20:13.232 --> 20:16.245
Is Pavich OK with you doing this?
-She's totally cool.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.597
What the hell do you think you're doing?

20:18.633 --> 20:19.765
Forensic pathology.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.445
No, no, no, no, you've resigned.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.685
You said I could be here.
-No, I said, "Clean out your office."

20:24.720 --> 20:26.245
You said no active cases.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.684
Olivia Reimers is not an active case.
-Exactly. It's a closed case.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.405
Her body's being destroyed
in three days.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.205
Yeah, probably, unless
her father claims it.

20:33.240 --> 20:34.565
He doesn't want to claim her.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.713
Because he is bankrupt
and he can't afford a funeral.

20:36.749 --> 20:39.069
Leave it alone, Daniel.
It's not your business.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.377
Reimers thinks she was murdered.
. You think I don't know that?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.925
I have a whole drawer
devoted to his letters

20:45.960 --> 20:48.562
and the Department of Public
Prosecution has even more.

20:48.598 --> 20:50.363
Fairley has a restraining order
against him,

20:50.399 --> 20:51.805
as does the girl's fiance.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.765
Callana, yeah.
-Who was never so much as charged.

20:55.967 --> 20:58.725
Look, Olivia Reimers is a
diagnosed manic-depressive

20:58.760 --> 21:01.445
whose cause of death Fairley
determined was brain injury.

21:01.481 --> 21:02.937
Fairley signed off on it.

21:02.973 --> 21:06.414
I signed off on Fairley and I
am not reopening this case.

21:06.450 --> 21:07.605
I'm not asking you to.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.165
Well, what are you asking?
-You're right.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.285
Olivia Reimers is a closed case,

21:12.320 --> 21:15.285
so her remains are no
longer state's evidence.

21:15.320 --> 21:19.125
There are three days until Reimers
claims her or the state cremates her.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.805
Let me have those three days.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.925
I have her father's permission
to re-examine the body.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.565
I just need yours.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.405
Look, on Friday, I get to
spend time with my daughter.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.125
Reimers will never get that again.

21:28.533 --> 21:31.365
He just wants to know
we didn't miss anything.

21:31.745 --> 21:34.125
Just let me have those three days.

21:34.509 --> 21:36.765
Alright. Three days.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.605
But you don't get Simon.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.965
What does the silver stain show?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.045
Pneumocystis.
-Which indicates?

21:44.563 --> 21:46.725
Fungal infection consistent with

21:46.760 --> 21:48.405
the compromised immune system
of the deceased.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.960
Good. Write it up.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.765
Are you signed in as Fairley?
-No, as me, why?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.845
I tried logging in as him,
but I couldn't.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.885
Fairley changed his passwords.
-So untrusting.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.080
What is his password?
-I don't know.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.045
And even if I did know,
you don't work here anymore.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.325
You've fallen in love with Fairley.
-You know what?

22:11.360 --> 22:12.805
I assisted him for one morning

22:12.840 --> 22:14.685
and he's already
complimented me on my work.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.565
You know how many times
you did that? Twice.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.680
In one week?
-In four years.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.212
So, come on, what is it?

22:21.720 --> 22:24.960
'Stiff buster'? 'Path god'?

22:25.132 --> 22:26.691
'Coldplay fan'?

22:27.800 --> 22:30.260
It's 'love n1nja'
with a numeral 1 for the I.

22:32.637 --> 22:34.520
What are you looking for, anyway?

22:35.116 --> 22:38.236
The name of the cop who
decided it wasn't homicide.

22:40.316 --> 22:41.952
Shit.

22:42.193 --> 22:43.913
Nichols.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.565
Looking sharp today, Nichols.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.280
Jesus Christ... Go away, Harrow.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.205
No need to ruin an already rotten day.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.765
I heard you were quitting.
-I heard you did quit.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.990
Can I help you?

23:09.720 --> 23:11.525
Sergeant Saroya Dass,

23:11.560 --> 23:13.765
new scene of crime,
she's just up from Melbourne.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.365
Dr Daniel Harrow. Prick.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.700
So, you're the SOCO?

23:19.325 --> 23:20.610
What happened?

23:20.920 --> 23:23.605
Someone tried to drown the foal
of a prize racehorse.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.645
Stablehand heard movement down here,
at the creek. He shouted out.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.925
The foal escaped. The perpetrator
got spooked and ran away.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.515
Attempted equicide.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.605
I don't think it was a master criminal.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.085
The killer didn't even bring a bridle.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.919
It's a shit job, dead-end case,
and I say we pack it up.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.573
But you don't agree?

23:42.560 --> 23:44.365
You can lead a horse to water, but...

23:44.400 --> 23:46.011
You can't make it drown?

23:46.600 --> 23:48.925
No bridle. So, if not a stick, then...?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.965
Carrots.
-Or apples.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.485
Which they do keep in a fridge up
there, where the horses are stabled.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.925
But?
-Locked.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.565
The complainant has the only key.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.045
Has the foal eaten?

23:58.080 --> 23:59.925
Since rescue?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.151
No.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.605
So, we should check its teeth
for carrots.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.165
Or apples.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.605
And if you find any...?

24:06.640 --> 24:09.405
Visit all the local convenience
stores open before dawn

24:09.440 --> 24:11.485
and see if they sold any carrots.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.805
Or apples.

24:13.132 --> 24:14.937
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

24:14.973 --> 24:17.041
Yeah, it's insane.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.600
Come on, Brian, let's give it a shot.

24:25.480 --> 24:26.646
What do you want, Harrow?

24:26.681 --> 24:28.565
The Olivia Reimers' case.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.205
For f...

24:30.240 --> 24:31.725
Bruce Reimers?

24:31.760 --> 24:33.445
Showed me the tile.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.165
"K-U." "Kurt."

24:35.200 --> 24:38.725
So what? Her last thoughts were
of the man she was gonna marry.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.605
Harrow, Olivia Reimers was a
medicated manic-depressive.

24:41.640 --> 24:45.587
There was no sign of forced entry.
No motive. No sign of a struggle.

24:45.623 --> 24:48.125
And Kurt Callana had a solid alibi.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.325
See, that's why they
call it a closed case.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.614
So, what would it take to reopen it?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.045
For you?

24:55.912 --> 24:58.240
A full confession from Kurt Callana.

25:01.889 --> 25:02.994
Mr Callana?

25:04.560 --> 25:07.285
I'm really sorry. Do I know you?

25:07.320 --> 25:08.685
Daniel Harrow.

25:08.959 --> 25:10.244
Hi.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.805
My goodness.

25:11.841 --> 25:13.325
What a beautiful engagement ring,

25:13.360 --> 25:14.925
and a beautiful girl.
-Harrow?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.645
Yes, I work with the coroner's office.

25:17.680 --> 25:21.645
You are aware that the body of
Olivia Reimers, former fiancee,

25:21.680 --> 25:23.445
is being cremated in two days' time.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.445
That is if no-one claims her.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.365
Her father's the executor of her will.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.936
I imagine he'll be claiming her.

25:29.119 --> 25:30.965
But you're not even contesting that.

25:31.346 --> 25:34.165
I mean, you were about to
marry Olivia when she died.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.845
You loved her, right?

25:35.880 --> 25:37.605
So, why aren't you even attempting

25:37.640 --> 25:40.045
to claim her remains and,
you know, see her off?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.405
Sue, why don't we head up?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.925
Awkward.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.365
It's not awkward. I did love her.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.165
I loved Olivia very much

25:47.200 --> 25:49.420
and when she took her own life,
it broke my heart.

25:50.905 --> 25:53.770
And it took me a long time
to put my life back together.

25:53.806 --> 25:57.046
And now I've found somebody I love
and who I want to be with.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.685
Her father says you killed her.

26:03.358 --> 26:04.765
Bruce Reimers?

26:05.234 --> 26:06.965
Do you know why Olivia
was on antidepressants?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.720
Have you read her police report?

26:10.672 --> 26:13.734
I trust we won't be bumping into
each other again, Mr Harrow.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.565
Careful.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.485
That's a second pressing.
I thought you'd gone home.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.485
And we all thought that you'd gone
for good. What are you doing?

27:10.520 --> 27:13.525
You're breaking into my files.
-I'm looking for her police report.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.545
So you can prove that I was wrong?
That you're better than me?

27:16.613 --> 27:19.578
You're a good pathologist, Fairley.
-But not as good as you.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.685
You're not better, you're lucky.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.005
You go dancing around,
trying to find out

27:24.040 --> 27:27.205
what the victims did, what they
thought, what they were like.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.485
You know what Olivia Reimers was like?

27:29.520 --> 27:31.344
Well, too bad, she's dead.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.345
You know the reason she died?

27:33.537 --> 27:36.045
There, massive haemorrhage.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.965
That's the cause, not the reason.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.325
I want to know why, yes.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.805
I want to know why she drank two cups
of vodka when she wasn't drinking.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.205
I want to know why her stomach

27:44.240 --> 27:45.925
was full of Amitriptyline
when she was off her meds.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.725
We are not in the 'why'
business, Harrow.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.125
We're in the 'what happened' business.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.885
Sometimes you can't tell
what happened unless you know why.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.765
That's the police's job. It's
the court's job. It's not our job.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.885
Look, will you just show me
her police report?

27:58.280 --> 28:01.405
You want to know why Olivia Reimers
killed herself, do you?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.240
Right. There.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.765
Suicide note.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.400
Read the last bit.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.925
"I can't handle it anymore.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.565
"The memories of what
my father did to me just won't go,

28:14.600 --> 28:16.085
"so I have to."

28:16.120 --> 28:19.125
She killed herself
because of her father.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.280
There's your why.
Log off when you're finished.

28:26.820 --> 28:28.340
Reimers?

28:30.060 --> 28:31.186
Harrow.

28:31.222 --> 28:33.626
Did you touch your own daughter?

28:33.760 --> 28:34.806
What?.

28:34.841 --> 28:39.445
Did you interfere with
your daughter, Olivia?

28:39.481 --> 28:42.766
No.
-I read her suicide note.

28:42.802 --> 28:44.487
You didn't think to mention that?

28:44.523 --> 28:46.565
Don't believe that note.
I never touched her.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.720
Were you the reason
she was on antidepressants?

28:51.720 --> 28:54.640
Yes, but, I... It's not...
-Fuck you.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.085
If you're thinking of moving in,

29:07.120 --> 29:08.605
there's quite a few people
in front of you,

29:08.640 --> 29:10.125
but I'm prepared to look
at your references.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.400
Bora Bora?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.445
You spoke to her?

29:15.480 --> 29:16.965
She spoke to me.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.885
Eight words, "I'm fine." "Don't."

29:19.920 --> 29:22.085
"Where's my passport?" And "Bora Bora."

29:22.120 --> 29:24.405
Technically seven words.
Bora Bora, which means...

29:24.440 --> 29:26.240
It's not a joke, Daniel.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.325
I know.

29:28.940 --> 29:32.896
And I have tried everything,
everything, to reach out to her.

29:32.932 --> 29:34.965
And now, not only are you talking to her...
-I tried too.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.685
..you are taking her out of the country.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.285
I didn't plan it.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.580
I got her to stand still
for four seconds, to listen.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.840
So, you expect me to believe
that you quit?

29:45.540 --> 29:47.062
I did.

29:48.149 --> 29:49.709
Call work.

29:53.987 --> 29:55.784
So, Fern let you in?

29:56.616 --> 29:58.168
Not yet.

29:59.453 --> 30:02.926
But if I can talk to her,
maybe we have a chance.

30:02.962 --> 30:04.607
Why is she like this?

30:04.920 --> 30:06.920
Other kids get through divorce.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.135
So, Bora Bora?

30:12.048 --> 30:13.726
Very Brando.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.065
Pack fat clothes.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.165
That's just what she said.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.565
Don't let her down, because
if you do, I swear to God,

30:20.600 --> 30:22.840
I will put you on a slab myself.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.805
Smooth transition?

30:34.840 --> 30:36.165
That's what you said.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.325
I seriously don't have
time for this, Lyle.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.885
What? And you think I do?

30:39.920 --> 30:41.965
You call this smooth?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
"A Fairley... small penis."

30:47.937 --> 30:48.937
Lovely.

31:01.180 --> 31:02.580
Finished already?

31:04.080 --> 31:05.605
Don't put her back into subzero.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.205
I know. She's scheduled
for cremation tomorrow?

31:08.240 --> 31:10.120
No, no, her remains have been claimed.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.845
Reimers doesn't have
two cents for a funeral.

31:14.625 --> 31:17.722
It wasn't Reimers who claimed
her body. It was Kurt Callana.

31:18.845 --> 31:21.045
Callana? Why?

31:21.281 --> 31:22.845
Why now?

31:23.209 --> 31:25.325
Is this any of your business?

31:25.641 --> 31:27.125
But don't you think it's strange?

31:27.160 --> 31:30.045
For more than a year,
he wants nothing to do with her.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.325
And, suddenly, when I go to see him

31:32.360 --> 31:33.885
and start asking about Olivia, he's...?

31:33.920 --> 31:35.805
You went to see him?

31:35.840 --> 31:37.365
There's something
he doesn't want me to find.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.526
Daniel?

31:38.561 --> 31:41.485
Daniel, seal up her body
and get it ready for collection.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.200
It's over.

31:50.840 --> 31:52.725
Belt.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.720
I just want to go up to CIV.

32:07.053 --> 32:08.285
Shirt.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.520
What?

32:10.138 --> 32:11.703
Take off your shirt.

32:12.747 --> 32:15.645
Yvonne, it's me. Daniel.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.645
I've been coming here for years.
I went to your 40th.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.885
Shirt, sir.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.160
Or leave.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.165
I'm gonna have Yvonne fired.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.685
What the hell are you doing here?

32:38.720 --> 32:40.245
Why aren't you returning my calls?

32:40.280 --> 32:41.725
Jesus.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.525
What do you want, Harrow?

32:43.560 --> 32:47.425
Kurt Callana. You told me
that he had a solid alibi?

32:47.461 --> 32:48.645
Yep.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.125
Well, what was it?

32:50.684 --> 32:52.725
When Olivia Reimers died,

32:52.760 --> 32:57.040
Kurt Callana was at the other side
of town, at his mother's house.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.805
Can I help you?

33:15.840 --> 33:20.485
Yes, I'm looking for the neighbour
of Sofia Callana.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.725
Yeah, well, I'm the neighbour,
Walter Kingsbury.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.405
But if you're trying
to sell something...

33:24.440 --> 33:26.525
No, no, no, I'm
here about the prize.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.606
What prize?

33:27.641 --> 33:29.605
The Real Estate Agent of the Year prize.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.202
Kurt Callana is a finalist

33:32.238 --> 33:35.605
and those who nominated him are in
line for their share of the $100,000.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.352
Look, I didn't nominate anybody.

33:37.388 --> 33:40.725
Well, we've been told that he's
a stalwart of the community.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.445
A loving family man.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.565
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

33:44.600 --> 33:48.245
How often does he visit his mother?
Was he here last Christmas?

33:48.754 --> 33:52.142
No, I didn't see him last Christmas?
-How about Easter?

33:52.178 --> 33:54.245
Was he here at Easter?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.960
Walter, go home.

33:58.040 --> 34:02.120
Who are you? Another one of
Bruce Reimers' snoops?

34:02.433 --> 34:04.044
I'm with the coroner.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.845
Kurt wasn't here last Easter, was he?

34:06.880 --> 34:10.127
Kurty didn't kill that poor girl.
She killed herself.

34:10.246 --> 34:12.925
She was a mess, a screw-up. A burden.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.565
And who wants mental illness
in the family, right?

34:15.600 --> 34:17.205
Kurt was better off without her.

34:17.239 --> 34:19.565
Do you have children, Mr...

34:19.600 --> 34:21.364
Harrow. Yes.

34:21.400 --> 34:25.165
Then you know you'd do
anything to protect them.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.382
Come back with the police if you want.

34:27.418 --> 34:29.725
I'll say the same thing. So will Walter.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.245
Kurt was here last Easter.

34:32.569 --> 34:34.760
He was helping me with the roses.

36:22.750 --> 36:25.607
Those are purchase contracts
for properties she bought.

36:26.278 --> 36:28.998
Why would she photograph her
own signature, over and over?

36:30.120 --> 36:32.040
Because that's not her signature.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.680
I wonder...

36:36.320 --> 36:38.900
Look who she bought
those properties from?

36:39.760 --> 36:41.245
Callana.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.445
They were his dud properties.

36:43.480 --> 36:45.685
He offloaded them to Olivia.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.765
Stuck her with his bad debt.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.200
So, she was taking
photos of them as proof.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.655
Olivia?

37:09.720 --> 37:11.017
Olivia?

37:14.120 --> 37:15.560
Olivia?.

37:18.675 --> 37:21.395
So, he forged the suicide note.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.485
But when I came to see you
and told you about the note,

37:25.520 --> 37:28.680
you admitted that you were the reason
she was on antidepressants.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.920
working all hours.

37:34.654 --> 37:36.819
When Olivia came along, I didn't stop.

37:37.280 --> 37:40.005
I hired babysitters and tutors

37:40.040 --> 37:44.685
and... when she was older, I sent her
to a private boarding school.

37:45.249 --> 37:47.080
But all she wanted was to be with me.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.440
And I said, "I'm not spending all
this money so you can come home."

37:53.040 --> 37:54.760
I said no.

37:57.664 --> 38:00.320
And that's... when she started...

38:02.760 --> 38:06.520
But when she needed me, I said no.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.678
Is this enough?

38:12.240 --> 38:14.085
To go back to the cops?

38:14.120 --> 38:15.393
No.

38:16.301 --> 38:19.176
But it's enough for me to believe you.

38:47.764 --> 38:49.305
What's up, Dad?

38:50.520 --> 38:51.887
You answered.

38:52.627 --> 38:54.165
Did I wake you?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.285
It's nearly five in the morning.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.685
Of course not. What's wrong?

38:59.093 --> 39:00.559
Nothing. I...

39:01.480 --> 39:03.280
I was just bored and I...

39:05.125 --> 39:06.711
So, you called me?

39:07.458 --> 39:09.005
Yeah.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.652
Checking in?

39:11.206 --> 39:12.686
Yeah.

39:16.050 --> 39:17.790
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.642
Hey...
-What?

39:21.587 --> 39:25.684
On Bettie, you've still got
that old DVD player, right?

39:25.982 --> 39:27.144
Yeah.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.600
OK.

39:33.710 --> 39:35.645
Have you been here all night?

39:35.680 --> 39:37.285
You're in early.

39:37.692 --> 39:39.388
I had a dream about you.

39:40.171 --> 39:44.165
You know, not only are
you just not my type,

39:44.200 --> 39:46.525
you are not anybody's type.

39:47.216 --> 39:48.948
I was worried about you.

39:48.984 --> 39:51.805
You weren't answering your phone.
-Shit.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.205
I mean, sorry.

39:54.083 --> 39:55.580
It's Fern, isn't it,

39:55.920 --> 39:57.605
why you resigned?

39:57.640 --> 39:59.560
It's all gonna be OK.

40:02.826 --> 40:06.365
What time are they coming for her?
-First thing.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.592
Eight.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.740
Have you ever been depressed?

40:14.240 --> 40:15.565
No.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.445
Not even about being gay?

40:17.480 --> 40:19.645
No, no, no, I mean it.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.805
Some people have total arsehole parents

40:21.840 --> 40:24.285
that make it really hard to come out to.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.160
No, my parents were cool.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.205
Maybe it was that simple.

40:29.604 --> 40:31.405
Maybe that's why she drank
and took too many pills.

40:31.440 --> 40:34.285
Here's the thing. She didn't.

40:34.575 --> 40:37.125
Sure, she had a lot of alcohol
in her blood

40:37.160 --> 40:39.365
and a lot of pills in her stomach,

40:39.862 --> 40:41.980
but most of them were undigested.

40:50.183 --> 40:53.405
This central incisor is freshly chipped.
How recently?

40:53.440 --> 40:56.285
Very. Fairley figured she chipped it
when she hit her head.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.125
But it wasn't on the bathroom floor

40:58.160 --> 40:59.725
and it wasn't in the stomach contents.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.295
It could still be in her throat.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.920
Endocam.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.525
Something hard impacted there.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.965
Right.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.005
But look at that.

41:20.449 --> 41:21.840
Scratched.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.885
Well, she was in the bathroom.

41:24.920 --> 41:26.565
She knew she took too many pills.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.687
Maybe she changed her mind
and tried to make herself vomit

41:29.723 --> 41:31.525
and scratched her throat
with her own fingers.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.285
Except there was no tissue
under her fingernails.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.880
Not even her own.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.960
So, where's the tooth chip?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.560
Maybe...

41:52.320 --> 41:55.680
His alibi is that he was pruning roses.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.960
But he wasn't.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.880
Where's he put her?

42:33.280 --> 42:35.325
We buy it together.
It's in both of our names.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.005
I already have an apartment.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.765
We can sell it, we could rent it out.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.245
Why can't we live there?

42:40.280 --> 42:42.165
Because we need the equity
in this other property.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.805
I don't need any more...

42:43.840 --> 42:44.846
..water.

42:44.881 --> 42:47.445
Under-hydration is the most
common cause of bowel upset.

42:47.780 --> 42:49.860
Lovely to see you again, Kurt.

42:52.360 --> 42:55.165
I'm sorry. Does that hurt?

42:55.200 --> 42:56.685
Call the cops.
-Sure, but let me have a look.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.445
I am a doctor, after all.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.045
Never saved a patient yet.
-Let me go.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.920
No, no, I insist. This won't hurt a bit.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.645
Aaagh.
-It'll hurt a lot.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.765
Nerve ending.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.365
Call the police. Call the police.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.445
Call an ambulance,
tell them they have a patient

43:12.480 --> 43:15.205
with a fresh fracture
to his proximal phalange.

43:15.240 --> 43:16.920
That's gonna need an X-ray.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.800
Thank you, driver. See you next time.

43:32.077 --> 43:34.842
I always imagined
the Bail Fairy to be taller.

43:34.878 --> 43:36.998
Can you imagine how unhappy she is?

43:38.080 --> 43:39.885
Did they X-ray Callana's hand?

43:39.920 --> 43:41.046
Yes.

43:41.081 --> 43:42.445
Did they find the tooth chip?

43:42.480 --> 43:43.805
Yes.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.365
Did you find Olivia's body?

43:45.400 --> 43:46.600
Eventually.

43:48.356 --> 43:50.436
But I didn't tell them that.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.800
You're gonna miss me.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.885
Detectives today took into custody

43:56.920 --> 44:00.365
35-year-old real estate
agent Kurt Callana after...

44:00.400 --> 44:02.240
I need that report.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.205
...Mr Callana's former fiancee,
28-year-old Olivia Reimers,

44:05.240 --> 44:08.760
who, until recently, had been
thought to have taken her own life.

44:15.380 --> 44:16.740
May I?

46:09.734 --> 46:12.880
My mooring fees are up to date, Officer.

46:13.017 --> 46:14.789
So, this is where you live?

46:15.082 --> 46:17.605
Yeah, not for long.
I'm off to the tropics tomorrow.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.245
Yeah, I heard that. Hey, jump on.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.880
There's something I want to show you.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.885
You're gonna love this.

46:43.920 --> 46:45.880
You're gonna want to cancel your trip.

46:47.640 --> 46:50.820
A fisherman found something
down there this afternoon.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.325
It's illegal to fish here.

46:53.360 --> 46:55.777
Yeah, well, I for one,
am glad that he did.

46:56.691 --> 46:58.805
Are those... bones?

46:58.840 --> 47:00.329
Human bones.

47:01.324 --> 47:04.309
We've already sent a bunch of
loose ones down to Turbot Street.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.485
Do you know what they're encased in?

47:07.520 --> 47:09.000
Concrete.

47:11.840 --> 47:14.040
Well, it's definitely not suicide.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.960
I knew you'd love it.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.405
Hey? Have you seen this?

47:41.653 --> 47:44.169
Adult male pulled from
the river, set in concrete.

47:44.205 --> 47:46.010
Yeah, Saroya told me.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.920
Saroya?

47:49.920 --> 47:52.045
Skull?
-Not yet, apparently.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.520
They're gonna keep diving.
Have a look at this.

47:56.120 --> 47:58.845
A finger. Severed.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.645
By a propeller?
-I don't know.

48:00.680 --> 48:04.565
It looks mechanically cut, to me.
I mean, scissors, secateurs.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.200
And look at these ridges.

48:07.420 --> 48:09.080
Shouldn't you be packing or something?

49:08.262 --> 49:09.827
Fern...

49:09.863 --> 49:11.868
I'm sorry.

49:11.965 --> 49:13.525
I have to stay.

49:21.517 --> 49:22.997
Fuck you, Dad.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.245
Next on Harrow...

51:07.280 --> 51:09.365
Do you have any clue who this guy was?

51:09.400 --> 51:10.925
None, whatsoever.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.405
Plus, there was a finger
bone deliberately severed.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.805
Body's come up.

51:14.840 --> 51:16.205
Do you think anything's gone?

51:16.240 --> 51:18.694
Like what?
-Like a heart.

51:18.789 --> 51:20.246
I'm sorry.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.725
How could you let her down like that?

51:25.760 --> 51:28.605
I don't think I'm gonna want
to talk to you for a while.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.925
I envy you. How you hunt.

51:30.960 --> 51:34.000
You'll... never... know.
