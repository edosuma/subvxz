The watch
that was returned to you

00:02.200 --> 00:04.500
was not the same watch
that you had sent.

00:04.567 --> 00:05.734
-That's right.
-You're lying.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.100
The only one who can
actually verify is your mother.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.867
Right.

00:10.934 --> 00:12.433
Who am I speaking to?

00:12.500 --> 00:13.433
Hello?

00:13.500 --> 00:15.000
[dial tone buzzing]

00:15.567 --> 00:18.166
Your mother didn't want to
talk to me and be embarrassed.

[Kevin] Court, come to order.
All rise.

00:49.367 --> 00:50.633
Have a seat, please.

00:51.667 --> 00:52.967
[Kevin] Hello, Judge.

00:53.033 --> 00:56.700
Case number 1046,
Diether versus DeNigris.

00:56.767 --> 00:57.767
Thank you.

00:58.967 --> 01:00.667
-Mr. Diether--
-Yes.

01:00.734 --> 01:03.600
You sold an item
to the defendant

01:03.667 --> 01:05.867
on an eBay account
that you have.

01:05.934 --> 01:07.533
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] It is your claim

01:07.600 --> 01:11.567
that the defendant
returned something to you

01:11.633 --> 01:13.467
that was not what you had
sent to him,

01:13.533 --> 01:17.266
and then complained
to eBay about it.

01:17.333 --> 01:20.166
That money was returned to him--

01:20.233 --> 01:21.433
By force.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.834
I don't need that.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.300
My apologies.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.333
[Judy] That money
was returned to him,

01:28.400 --> 01:33.500
so you are out the money,
and you are out the item.

01:33.567 --> 01:35.400
-Mm-mm.
-And in addition,

01:35.467 --> 01:39.667
I believe that you say
something about a negative--

01:39.734 --> 01:41.533
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] --post that he put up--

01:41.600 --> 01:42.834
-It was not a--
-about you.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.300
It-it was not a negative post.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.834
Because of this
on our eBay record,

01:47.900 --> 01:49.700
there was a mark called

01:49.767 --> 01:51.900
"Case Settled
Without Seller Resolution."

01:51.967 --> 01:53.266
-Okay.
-[John] And we lost

01:53.333 --> 01:54.633
our top-rated seller status

01:54.700 --> 01:57.000
which would have otherwise
been on all of our listings

01:57.066 --> 02:00.800
for one year, plus we lost
the discount on eBay fees

02:00.867 --> 02:04.066
that comes with top-rated
seller status, 20 percent off.

02:04.133 --> 02:08.700
Okay, so now the item
that you posted for sale

02:08.767 --> 02:10.800
-was a pocket watch.
-Yes, ma'am.

02:10.867 --> 02:14.133
[Judy] It was allegedly
a 14-karat gold

02:14.200 --> 02:16.000
antique pocket watch.

02:16.066 --> 02:18.967
Now, from what I gather
from your paper, sir,

02:19.033 --> 02:20.600
you work with a partner?

02:20.667 --> 02:22.367
-Yes.
-Who is not here.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.400
Right.

02:23.467 --> 02:27.367
Who was the person
who you allege sourced the item.

02:27.433 --> 02:28.367
That's right.

02:28.433 --> 02:32.066
And sourced the item
through his company.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.133
That's right.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.600
And that company
is called Whitney.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.800
No, no, no. My eBay user ID
is Whitney Co.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.200
[Judy] Whitney Co.

02:40.266 --> 02:42.533
What else do you sell
on Whitney Co.?

02:42.600 --> 02:44.133
It was historically jewelry.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.767
I had a jewelry concern that sold

02:46.834 --> 02:50.033
over half a million dollars
on eBay since 1999.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.800
The past couple of years,
as I had been in business

02:52.867 --> 02:56.533
with my business partner,
he comes up with finds,

02:56.600 --> 03:00.367
buys items that are
appropriate for eBay.

03:00.433 --> 03:02.433
Now he's got
a very large enterprise,

03:02.500 --> 03:05.667
but I get the stuff that's
the small high-value items.

03:05.734 --> 03:08.667
Bring it up on your phone,
sir, for me, please.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.200
I'd like to see
some of the items

03:10.266 --> 03:12.834
that you currently
have for sale.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.467
Here you can see, um--

03:14.533 --> 03:15.467
[Judy] Okay, I'd
just like to see

03:15.533 --> 03:17.000
what has been for sale--

03:17.066 --> 03:18.767
-This is--
-[Judy] --in the last month.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.533
Okay. Well, I'm going to
give you my feedback ratings.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.533
-These are my feed--
-No, no,

03:22.600 --> 03:24.133
I don't want feedback ratings.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.934
Well, well, the feedback gives--

03:26.000 --> 03:28.266
-This is the last several--
-[Judy] Okay.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.600
-[John] --items sold.
-[Judy] Thank you.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.066
And I also have,
uh, paper copies,

03:32.133 --> 03:34.633
if you'd like to see things that
we sold around the same time.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.333
Vintage Baronet leather
clutch wallet, very nice.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.400
Vintage oriental bird opaque
China plate,

03:40.467 --> 03:44.033
item was a great experience,
perfect packaging.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.433
Okay, thank you.

03:52.467 --> 03:54.600
Okay. Now, let's start off with,

03:54.667 --> 03:58.066
when did you advertise
this watch for sale?

03:58.133 --> 04:00.467
The auction started,
it's a seven-day auction,

04:00.533 --> 04:02.667
it started in, uh, late March

04:02.734 --> 04:05.233
and ended, I believe, April 4th.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.166
Tell me when you saw the ad.

04:07.233 --> 04:08.900
I'd seen the ad, uh,

04:08.967 --> 04:10.934
right at the beginning
of the auction,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.700
within hours of it being listed.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.166
-And you put in a bid?
-[Anthony] Yes, I did,

04:14.233 --> 04:15.400
-Your Honor.
-[Judy] Why?

04:15.467 --> 04:17.333
Because it was
a solid gold watch

04:17.400 --> 04:20.266
and it started off cheap,
so, you know, I was, of course,

04:20.333 --> 04:22.000
I was gonna put in
a starting bid

04:22.066 --> 04:23.367
because it was so low,

04:23.433 --> 04:24.533
-in hopes of winning it.
-[Judy] Okay.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.033
What kind of work do you do, sir?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.133
I deal in antiques.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.100
Where?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.767
Uh, in North Carolina.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.100
When you say
you deal in antiques,

04:31.166 --> 04:32.467
how do you deal in antiques?

04:32.533 --> 04:34.467
Go to auctions
on the weekends,

04:34.533 --> 04:37.367
and sell and consign
higher-end auctions,

04:37.433 --> 04:38.433
higher-end antiques.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.934
How long have you
been doing that?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.500
About ten years
with my father,

04:41.567 --> 04:43.700
who's been doing it
his whole life.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.467
-He's 73.
-And what was the final

04:45.533 --> 04:46.600
price that you settled on?

04:46.667 --> 04:50.500
On this watch, I won
the auction for 1,314 dollars.

04:50.567 --> 04:51.700
Now, Mr. Diether--

04:51.767 --> 04:53.467
Yes.
Your business partner,

04:53.533 --> 04:54.600
who is not present,

04:54.667 --> 04:57.700
actually was the one
who sourced this watch?

04:57.767 --> 04:58.600
That's correct.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.600
Do you operate out of the
same location as he does?

05:01.667 --> 05:02.633
I live close by.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.400
His store, he's got
a large retail store,

05:05.467 --> 05:06.734
and I live close by.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.567
The eBay stuff
I do out of my house, but--

05:08.633 --> 05:10.800
-[Judy] Okay.
-I verified the watch

05:10.867 --> 05:11.867
-because I've--
-[Judy] Shh.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.200
Now, he sourced the watch.

05:15.266 --> 05:18.633
Do you know when he sourced
the watch, and from where?

05:18.700 --> 05:20.800
It was in March,

05:20.867 --> 05:26.066
and he bought a lot of old items.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.033
Some were valuable,

05:27.100 --> 05:28.867
-some were not.
-[Judy] Okay.

05:28.934 --> 05:30.033
He bought a lot,

05:30.100 --> 05:32.800
and this watch allegedly
came from that lot?

05:32.867 --> 05:34.834
-Yes.
-Did you purchase the lot?

05:34.900 --> 05:37.166
Or did you purchase
individual items?

05:37.233 --> 05:39.333
How was the business conducted?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.900
Sure. This was
a client of Mr. Herzenberg's

05:41.967 --> 05:45.433
who came in and had a,
uh, a box of old things

05:45.500 --> 05:47.300
from a house that had been, uh--

05:47.367 --> 05:48.633
I don't know that.
And that's hearsay.

05:48.700 --> 05:49.633
-[John] Okay.
-So, you can't tell me.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.033
I want to know what you did
with the watch.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.433
[dramatic music]

05:53.500 --> 05:56.367
Clearly, sir, your mother
didn't want to talk to me.

05:56.433 --> 05:58.333
I mean, we're not
on good terms right now.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.900
So, that's probably
one reason why.

05:59.967 --> 06:01.800
Yeah, she's not
on good terms with you,

06:01.867 --> 06:03.066
she would have loved
to talk to me.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.700
But when she heard it was me,
she hung up.

06:04.767 --> 06:07.433
So, she clearly didn't want to
talk to me and be embarrassed.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.767
[dramatic music]

06:11.934 --> 06:13.633
[dramatic music]

06:18.500 --> 06:20.800
[narrator] <i>John Diether</i>
<i>claims antiques dealer</i>

06:20.867 --> 06:23.133
<i>Anthony DeNigris</i>
<i>owes him for the cost</i>

06:23.200 --> 06:25.834
<i>of a 14-karat</i>
<i>gold pocket watch.</i>

06:25.900 --> 06:28.467
<i>Anthony says</i>
<i>he received a watch,</i>

06:28.533 --> 06:31.066
<i>but not the one he purchased.</i>

06:31.133 --> 06:33.767
Now, I want to know
what you did with the watch.

06:33.834 --> 06:35.934
Oh, he gave me that
along with a lot of

06:36.000 --> 06:39.166
other items to sell
that had decent value.

06:39.233 --> 06:43.467
I got out my loop
and opened up the cover,

06:43.533 --> 06:46.867
looked at the markings
and, uh, put all the markings

06:46.934 --> 06:50.166
in the listing that it was
an Aurora watch,

06:50.233 --> 06:53.166
uh, 15 jewel, uh,

06:53.233 --> 06:55.767
that it was 14-karat gold throughout,

06:55.834 --> 06:58.433
and put the dimensions in,
the weight,

06:58.500 --> 07:00.734
and about
14 or 15 pictures of it.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.400
Okay. May I see
those photographs, please?

07:02.467 --> 07:05.500
We only have one
because this is the one

07:05.567 --> 07:08.800
that was in the actual
sales record,

07:08.867 --> 07:12.467
and then the actual listing
is not obtainable from eBay

07:12.533 --> 07:15.867
because after 60 days,
those listings go away.

07:15.934 --> 07:17.567
I did call eBay--

07:17.633 --> 07:19.900
Don't tell me, don't tell me
about the conversation.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.400
[John] Oh, okay.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.834
I may have a-- I have
another photo, Your Honor.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.900
It's the same photo,
only bigger.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.934
[Judy] So, it's a closed-cover watch?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.333
Yeah, it was closed-cover,

07:33.400 --> 07:35.166
and then on the back,
it actually had two.

07:35.233 --> 07:36.867
One to go over the mechanicals,

07:36.934 --> 07:38.400
and then another one
to close it.

07:38.467 --> 07:39.734
It had good weight.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.433
Now, date sold on April 6,
date paid April 6,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.233
date shipped April 6--

07:45.300 --> 07:48.300
and date delivered April 11th,
all of 2020.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.667
-Hm-mm.
-[Judy] Now, it was shipped

07:50.734 --> 07:52.934
to a Pamela.
And who is that, sir?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.033
[Anthony] That's my mother,
Your Honor.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.367
She resides in Florida.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.367
Where do you reside?

07:56.433 --> 07:57.367
[Anthony] North Carolina.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.867
Me and my fiancée
were visiting at the time.

07:59.934 --> 08:03.100
Just-- You sent this
to a post office box?

08:03.166 --> 08:04.600
Right.
Her post office box.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.567
-No.
-[Judy] Shhh. Just a sec.

08:07.633 --> 08:10.800
You and your fiancée
went from North Carolina

08:10.867 --> 08:14.333
in April of twenty-twenty
to visit your mother?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.066
-Yes, ma'am.
-From when to when?

08:16.133 --> 08:18.066
We were there
for two weeks approximately.

08:18.133 --> 08:19.000
How did you get there?

08:19.066 --> 08:21.667
We drove. We brought
our son, Michael, with us,

08:21.734 --> 08:23.734
so she can see him,
her grandson.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.400
When did you leave
North Carolina, what date?

08:26.467 --> 08:27.667
This is almost
two years ago, Your Honor,

08:27.734 --> 08:29.066
I mean, I don't--

08:29.133 --> 08:30.233
It's not two years ago,
it's a year.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.867
A year, a year
and some change, uh, I mean,

08:32.934 --> 08:35.000
it was somewhere
towards the end of March.

08:35.066 --> 08:36.133
And when did you get home?

08:36.200 --> 08:37.433
Middle of April.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.533
How old is your son?

08:38.600 --> 08:39.600
He is four now.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.200
-He had just turned three.
-In what--

08:41.266 --> 08:42.834
We were actually there
for his birthday.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.166
-[Judy] How-- Shh, just a second.
-Sorry.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.800
From what account
was this paid?

08:46.867 --> 08:49.300
It was paid
from my PayPal account

08:49.367 --> 08:51.567
that I have access to and use, it's--

08:51.633 --> 08:52.633
[Judy] No, no, no, no, no.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.700
Whose name
is the PayPal account in?

08:54.767 --> 08:55.867
That's what
I was explaining to you.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.166
It's under my sister's name,
Wendy.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.166
Why?

08:59.233 --> 09:01.333
We have multiple accounts
we do business with.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.734
That's just the one I was using
that day that I paid this item--

09:04.800 --> 09:05.867
particular item with.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.633
What's your mother's
phone number?

09:07.700 --> 09:09.467
Eight-six-three...

09:11.600 --> 09:13.033
...three-zero...

09:23.300 --> 09:27.033
[mutters softly] I believe the area code
is 863. I could have been wrong.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.300
[woman] <i>Hello?</i>

09:42.367 --> 09:43.533
Is this Pamela...?

09:45.934 --> 09:47.400
This is Judge Judy Sheindlin.

09:47.467 --> 09:48.700
Who am I speaking to?

09:52.033 --> 09:52.867
Hello?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.333
[sighs deeply]

10:15.266 --> 10:17.033
Interesting. Clearly, sir,

10:17.100 --> 10:18.633
your mother didn't
want to talk to me.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.133
-[chuckles]
-[audience laughs]

10:22.200 --> 10:23.667
I mean, we're not
on good terms right now,

10:23.734 --> 10:25.367
so that's probably
one reason why.

10:25.433 --> 10:27.834
Yeah, she's not
on good terms with you,

10:27.900 --> 10:29.066
she would have loved
to talk to me.

10:29.133 --> 10:30.567
Your mother probably loves me.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.433
-[Anthony] She does.
-Yeah, I'm sure she does.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.300
-Everybody loves you.
-[Judy] I'm, just a second.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.600
I'm sure she does.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.100
But when she heard it was me,
she hung up.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.900
So, she clearly didn't want to
talk to me and be embarrassed.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.567
So, this is what happened.

10:41.633 --> 10:43.533
The watch that was
returned to you

10:43.600 --> 10:45.767
was not the same watch
that you allege

10:45.834 --> 10:47.700
-that you sent to the defendant.
-Yes, Your Honor.

10:47.767 --> 10:50.767
You claimed that he sent
back in the box junk.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.500
-Yes, ma'am.
-Now, the only one

10:52.567 --> 10:54.667
who can actually verify

10:54.734 --> 10:57.734
what was in that box
is somebody who,

10:57.800 --> 11:00.233
for some reason,
didn't want to talk to me.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.333
This is my witness
right here.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.667
She was right there
when I opened the box.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.367
-He did not send me the watch--
-[Judy] Just a second.

11:04.433 --> 11:05.367
-I purchased--
-[Judy] Just a second.

11:05.433 --> 11:06.433
-[Anthony] --on eBay.
-Just a second.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.500
-[Anthony] Okay.
-I don't know that--

11:07.567 --> 11:08.834
-[Anthony] I already won the case on eBay.
-I don't know that

11:08.900 --> 11:12.133
because the only person, sir,

11:12.200 --> 11:16.467
the only person who can get
into that post office box

11:16.533 --> 11:17.700
is your mother.

11:17.767 --> 11:19.734
And she was there when we
opened the package to take it out.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.333
-[Judy] Who's that?
-This is my fiancée, Stacie.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.433
[Judy] I don't care.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.433
-[audience laughs]
-[Anthony] Ma'am--

11:23.500 --> 11:24.700
I don't care.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.033
-We won the case with eBay.
-I don't care. I don't care.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.767
He lost. He didn't respond
to none of my messages.

11:28.834 --> 11:29.700
-I need a--
-[Judy] Just a second.

11:29.767 --> 11:30.900
-That's not true, Your Honor.
-[Judy] Just a second.

11:30.967 --> 11:31.900
That is absolutely true. You're lying.

11:31.967 --> 11:33.934
-You're a liar.
-[Judy] Just a second.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.200
-[Anthony] You tried to scam me.
-Just a second. Shh.

11:35.266 --> 11:38.300
You just--
Sir, you may be right.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.300
I'm absolutely right.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.166
[Judy] I don't know
whether you are or not.

11:41.233 --> 11:44.066
All I know is your mother
didn't want to talk to me.

11:44.133 --> 11:46.166
By the way, you indicated
that you and your mother

11:46.233 --> 11:48.200
-aren't on good terms now.
-That's right, we're not.

11:48.266 --> 11:52.000
Well, I mean,
you schlepped with your child

11:52.066 --> 11:53.767
hours and hours in a car

11:53.834 --> 11:56.400
for your mother
to get to see her grandson.

11:56.467 --> 11:57.934
That was then.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.233
[John] Your Honor,
may I add something

11:59.300 --> 12:01.266
-about where I shipped it?
-Yes.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.533
I did not ship it
to the mother's address,

12:03.600 --> 12:06.333
because he sent me a message that said,

12:06.400 --> 12:08.533
"Please send it to Pamela."

12:08.600 --> 12:10.767
Now this whole time
I'm filling with Pamela,

12:10.834 --> 12:14.000
and he said, "Send it
to the street address

12:14.066 --> 12:16.800
in Gibsonville, North Carolina."
That's where I sent it.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.000
-Just a-- Just a second.
-[Anthony] No, you wouldn't sent it there.

12:18.066 --> 12:18.900
Just a second.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.467
-Shh, just a second.
-That's where I sent it.

12:20.533 --> 12:23.300
I'm just looking
in these shipping details

12:23.367 --> 12:24.467
that you gave me.

12:24.533 --> 12:28.700
It says that you shipped to
Pamela... Post Office Box...

12:30.867 --> 12:32.166
-Get your story straight.
-Shhh.

12:32.233 --> 12:33.667
Moore Haven, Florida.

12:33.734 --> 12:35.734
That's what you just gave me.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.700
[John] May I explain?

12:36.767 --> 12:37.734
Sure.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.734
He knew what he was doing.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.734
[Judy] No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.033
-Don't tell me, just explain.
-[John] Okay.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.333
Your Honor,
he sent me a message.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.533
You can have
private messages in eBay.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.700
Just, show it to me.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.600
I don't have that off eBay.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.600
Because the messages
go away after 90 days.

12:51.667 --> 12:57.767
He told me to ship it to Pamela
with the Gibsonville address.

12:57.834 --> 13:01.700
I never shipped to Florida
because he said ship it here.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.500
And he said,
"And this is another one

13:03.567 --> 13:06.200
of my verified
PayPal addresses."

13:06.266 --> 13:08.900
Now if you have
a PayPal verified address,

13:08.967 --> 13:10.600
you're safe to send it to there. Now--

13:10.667 --> 13:11.600
[Judy] Just a second.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.567
Could you repeat again
the address that you sent it to?

13:15.633 --> 13:17.600
Yes, Your Honor.
I sent it to

13:17.667 --> 13:23.633
90... Street, Gibsonville,
North Carolina, 27249,

13:23.700 --> 13:24.700
at his request.

13:24.767 --> 13:27.200
Shh, just one second.
Give me the zip code again, sir.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.400
I don't write that fast.

13:28.467 --> 13:30.100
-Stenography wasn't my thing.
-[John] My apologies.

13:30.166 --> 13:33.166
Mine neither. Uh, 27249.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.200
Stand up,
I have one question to you.

13:35.266 --> 13:37.100
[dramatic music]

13:37.166 --> 13:38.934
Judge Judy, you misunderstood
what I was saying.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.333
I did not say I had it
shipped home.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.600
-I said I was--
-Shhh.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.934
[Anthony] --trying to, in case
I had to leave Florida early.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.800
You misunderstood
what I said completely.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.200
That's why
I have a stenographer.

13:48.266 --> 13:50.467
-[Anthony] Yes, ma'am.
-So...

13:50.533 --> 13:52.367
I'll zip it.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.200
[dramatic music]

14:02.567 --> 14:05.400
[narrator] <i>John Diether</i>
<i>is accusing antiques dealer</i>

14:05.467 --> 14:08.467
<i>Anthony DeNigris</i>
<i>of returning the wrong item,</i>

14:08.533 --> 14:11.200
<i>and keeping the 14-karat</i>
<i>gold pocket watch</i>

14:11.266 --> 14:13.133
<i>he originally sold him.</i>

14:13.200 --> 14:15.166
Now, how long have you
been living together?

14:15.233 --> 14:16.133
Seven years.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.533
You have your wallet
with you?

14:17.600 --> 14:18.900
It's in the trailer.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.467
You have a driver's license?

14:20.533 --> 14:21.500
I have an ID, yes.

14:21.567 --> 14:22.900
[Judy] What's your address?

14:22.967 --> 14:24.467
It's 90... Street.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.533
-[Judy] Now sit.
-Okay.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.500
[audience chuckles]

14:28.567 --> 14:31.834
I want you
to explain to me if,

14:31.900 --> 14:33.600
please don't play with papers,

14:33.667 --> 14:35.600
-it's distracting to me.
-My apologies.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.266
I'd like you to give me

14:37.333 --> 14:40.266
what I consider
a plausible explanation--

14:40.333 --> 14:41.533
[Anthony] Explanation
of how he had my address.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.667
No--

14:42.734 --> 14:44.266
-Very smart.
-Yeah, 'cause I'm intelligent.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.700
-[Judy] Very smart.
-Yes.

14:45.767 --> 14:48.467
I want you to give me
a plausible explanation of how--

14:48.533 --> 14:49.533
[Anthony] I have.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.567
[Judy] --this man
has your home address.

14:52.633 --> 14:54.166
Because he's not lying
about what he just said.

14:54.233 --> 14:56.100
I did ask him to send it
to that address.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.633
So, I did-- in case
I left Florida early

14:58.700 --> 15:00.800
and returned home
to North Carolina.

15:00.867 --> 15:01.867
Would you read back,

15:01.934 --> 15:04.567
would you read back to me,
Whitney,

15:06.867 --> 15:11.166
what Mr. DeNigris said,
early on in the case,

15:11.233 --> 15:13.633
when I asked him
why did he have it sent

15:13.700 --> 15:16.633
to a post office box in Florida?

15:16.700 --> 15:18.767
[Anthony] We were down there--
Right, I--

15:18.834 --> 15:20.200
[Anthony chuckling]

15:20.266 --> 15:23.200
Why did he have it sent
to a post office box,

15:23.266 --> 15:26.533
and then I asked him for
his mother's telephone number,

15:26.600 --> 15:29.066
because she would have been the
only one who could go into it.

15:29.133 --> 15:34.233
And why did he tell me he had
it sent to a post office box?

15:39.333 --> 15:40.433
Had something to do with,

15:40.500 --> 15:42.900
they took the boy
to see his grandmother.

15:42.967 --> 15:45.600
They drove, right,
it was before that.

15:45.667 --> 15:46.700
[murmurs]

15:47.266 --> 15:49.500
He said, "We drove.
We brought our son, Michael,

15:49.567 --> 15:51.100
with us so she can see him,
her grandson."

15:51.166 --> 15:52.967
No, no, no,
but it was before that.

15:53.033 --> 15:55.800
I said, "Why would you send it
to a post office box?"

15:55.867 --> 15:57.433
And he answered me.

15:58.633 --> 15:59.967
He said,
"Me and my fiancée

16:00.100 --> 16:01.633
were visiting at the time."

16:01.700 --> 16:04.066
That-that was his answer
why he sent it to a post office.

16:04.133 --> 16:05.266
[Whitney] "And we were there
for two weeks approximately."

16:05.333 --> 16:07.967
[Anthony mumbles]

16:08.033 --> 16:09.200
[Judy] There, right.

16:09.266 --> 16:12.533
And now I want you to go forward
to where we just sort of

16:12.600 --> 16:15.600
left off when he said
he had it shipped home,

16:15.667 --> 16:16.700
-to his home.
-[Anthony] No, I did not say

16:16.767 --> 16:18.400
-I had it shipped home.
-At 902...

16:18.467 --> 16:20.200
Judge Judy, you misunderstood
what I was saying.

16:20.266 --> 16:21.967
I did not say
I had it shipped home.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.300
-I said I was just trying to
-[Judy] Shhh.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.533
in case I had to leave Florida early.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.533
That's what I said.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.767
-[Judy laughs]
-You misunderstood

16:27.834 --> 16:29.266
what I said completely.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.266
-He said--
-That's why I have a stenographer.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.834
-[Anthony] Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] So--

16:35.000 --> 16:36.066
I'll zip it.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.834
[smiles] He said,
"I did ask him to send it

16:37.900 --> 16:40.400
"to that address in case
I return from Florida early

16:40.467 --> 16:42.066
and return home
to North Carolina."

16:42.133 --> 16:43.700
That's such a lot
of doublespeak.

16:43.767 --> 16:44.900
-[audience laughing]
-You either had it

16:44.967 --> 16:46.367
sent to a post office box

16:46.433 --> 16:47.967
which you said
you had it sent to,

16:48.033 --> 16:50.200
or "I had him send it
to my house

16:50.266 --> 16:53.133
in case we left early."
That's ridiculous.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.700
[Anthony] The bottom line,
Your Honor, is he just sent--

16:54.767 --> 16:56.133
Bottom line, nothing.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.133
[Anthony] I opened the case--
Bottom line, nothing.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.834
[Anthony] --with eBay,
I won the case.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.100
Okay, they decided
in my favor.

17:00.166 --> 17:01.300
He appealed it, he lost,

17:01.367 --> 17:03.467
he never responded to
not one of my messages--

17:03.533 --> 17:05.967
asking him did, what,
why do I have this watch

17:06.033 --> 17:06.967
that I didn't purchase?

17:07.033 --> 17:08.500
This is not the watch
I purchased.

17:08.567 --> 17:09.700
I was looking for an explanation.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.000
He never responded to me one time.

17:11.066 --> 17:12.000
[John] I have the--

17:12.066 --> 17:13.400
-This right here, says that.
-[Judy] Just a second.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.233
This is from eBay,
if you want to read this.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.867
Oh, I absolutely do.
But listen to me, sir.

17:17.934 --> 17:20.867
eBay isn't as smart as I am.

17:20.934 --> 17:22.467
-[Anthony] I never said they were.
-They didn't ask you--

17:22.533 --> 17:24.900
they didn't ask you
where you sent the watch.

17:24.967 --> 17:28.467
You gave me, in a short span
of seven minutes,

17:28.533 --> 17:32.734
two different explanations
why you had the watch sent

17:32.800 --> 17:34.100
-I did not.
-to two different states.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.734
You misunderstood
what I was saying.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.433
I just had it read back to you.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.200
[Anthony] You obviously
misunderstood it again.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.266
Well, then I ask you, how
did he get your home address?

17:42.333 --> 17:45.000
And I said I wrote him
a message on eBay stating,

17:45.066 --> 17:46.734
"Can you please send this
to North Carolina

17:46.800 --> 17:49.433
in case I return home early?"
That's what I said.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
For the third time,
you misunderstood

17:50.567 --> 17:51.500
-what I was saying.
-[Judy] Just a second.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.767
[laughs] Okay.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.467
I rely on you, Whitney.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.467
[Anthony laughs]

17:56.533 --> 17:58.567
[Judy] Thank you. Okay. [sighs]

17:58.633 --> 18:00.567
Thirteen-fourteen judgment
for the plaintiff.

18:00.633 --> 18:01.567
-[Anthony] Good for him.
-We're finished.

18:01.633 --> 18:02.867
Your Honor,
what about, uh--?

18:02.934 --> 18:04.333
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.600
-Thank you.
-[upbeat music]

18:07.667 --> 18:09.800
She saw what, right through

18:09.867 --> 18:13.133
what he was trying to pull,
and that he could stand up there

18:13.200 --> 18:14.767
in front of her
and lie like that.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.800
It was definitely not.
This is my witness right here.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.834
She was right there when I
opened the, opened the package.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.467
It wasn't-- first off, it was silver,

18:20.533 --> 18:21.900
and it wasn't gold.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.734
It was not real. It was crappy.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.633
And, um, you know,
we do this all the time.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.333
I mean, he's,
he knows what he does.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.166
No, that-that is not true.

18:31.233 --> 18:34.667
And, um, well, the allegation
that they made was that I sent,

18:34.734 --> 18:37.233
they sent it back to me,
a piece of junk,

18:37.300 --> 18:40.367
not even a silver watch,
a metal piece of junk.

18:40.433 --> 18:41.467
That's exactly what he did.

18:41.533 --> 18:43.367
He sent me the item,
the wrong item.

18:43.433 --> 18:44.367
I didn't purchase that.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.533
That's not what I purchased
for 1,340 dollars.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.500
I was very upset that my money
was being tied up

18:48.567 --> 18:51.300
for more than ten days while
I had an item I didn't purchase.,

18:51.367 --> 18:53.333
I couldn't do anything with.
It was a piece of junk.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.967
That I chose them out of 36,000

18:56.033 --> 18:57.500
satisfied customers to scam,

18:57.567 --> 18:59.333
that's pretty lucky, I would say.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.500
I won't buy from him no more,

19:00.567 --> 19:01.500
-that's right.
-[Stacie laughs]

19:01.567 --> 19:02.834
Well, the thing is, uh,

19:02.900 --> 19:04.900
I've already reported
this gentleman to eBay,

19:04.967 --> 19:06.767
so they will be
on the lookout for him

19:06.834 --> 19:08.400
so he can't pull this again.

19:08.467 --> 19:11.533
Otherwise, it's a
once-in-a-20-year problem.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.900
[Judy] I'm going to tell you
a cute story.

19:12.967 --> 19:14.800
I don't know.
You know that case,

19:14.867 --> 19:19.033
the takeaway from that case is,
I suppose you have to be careful

19:19.100 --> 19:21.100
when you buy something
from eBay.

19:21.166 --> 19:22.767
Make sure it's from
a legitimate firm,

19:22.834 --> 19:24.600
and you have to make sure
that the people

19:24.667 --> 19:26.834
you're selling it to
are legitimate people.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.633
But it's a cute story.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.633
eBay has been in existence
for about 24 years.

19:32.700 --> 19:37.166
And I know that because Jerry
and I went away to a Club Med,

19:37.233 --> 19:40.233
just about that time,
24 years ago.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.600
And on the plane
coming home with us,

19:42.667 --> 19:46.500
the couple sitting behind us
was a young man with a guitar

19:46.567 --> 19:48.400
and his girlfriend,
and we'd been talking

19:48.467 --> 19:50.667
because I had just started
my first program,

19:50.734 --> 19:53.767
and he said he was starting
a new business.

19:53.834 --> 19:56.934
The next day, he was going to
appear on the <i>Today Show</i>

19:57.000 --> 19:59.600
to sell something, I don't know,
a vest or a jacket

19:59.667 --> 20:02.667
with his new company
called eBay.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.934
And he tried to tell me something
about the company,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.633
and the company he said
was started

20:07.700 --> 20:12.400
because his girlfriend
collected Pez dispenser tops

20:12.467 --> 20:13.800
and he was helping her

20:13.867 --> 20:16.066
to find other people
who collected and traded

20:16.133 --> 20:17.734
Pez dispenser tops.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.834
I've never purchased anything
on eBay myself.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.000
I'm not that sophisticated
with the machine,

20:23.066 --> 20:24.567
but I always remember
that young man

20:24.633 --> 20:27.100
and how happy I am
for him to have,

20:27.166 --> 20:28.667
a quarter of a century later,

20:28.734 --> 20:31.400
something that is in
everybody's vernacular

20:31.467 --> 20:33.367
and part of everybody's life.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.533
Anyways, you know,
I guess the takeaway is,

20:35.600 --> 20:36.734
you got to have a dream.
