41:09.200 --> 41:12.560
After some brief
deliberation on my part,

41:12.560 --> 41:16.160
and considering that the gun
you took into that theater

41:16.160 --> 41:19.850
was unloaded, I think
12 months probation

41:19.850 --> 41:20.767
should be sufficient--

41:20.767 --> 41:21.567
Yes!

41:21.567 --> 41:23.120
JUDGE BOYLE: --in this case.

41:23.120 --> 41:26.240
But Mr. Sheldon, don't
you ever let me see

41:26.240 --> 41:28.520
you in front of my court again.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.360
Do you hear me?

41:32.010 --> 41:32.940
So ruled.

41:41.310 --> 41:43.260
EMILY: I hope you
don't mind, but I

41:43.260 --> 41:44.890
wanted to see you in action.

41:44.890 --> 41:45.690
Ah.

41:45.690 --> 41:47.580
Well, why?

41:47.580 --> 41:48.910
EMILY: I don't know.

41:48.910 --> 41:50.790
I guess I had some
time on my hands,

41:50.790 --> 41:53.940
and I feel the need to
apologize for being so

41:53.940 --> 41:55.860
forward with you the other day.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.465
Calling you a Savant, and all.

41:57.465 --> 41:59.700
[LAUGHS] Oh.

41:59.700 --> 42:01.770
Savant?

42:01.770 --> 42:03.670
It's really not a problem.

42:03.670 --> 42:04.950
Great.

42:04.950 --> 42:06.750
Because I need your
help with something.

42:06.750 --> 42:07.610
Oh.

42:07.610 --> 42:08.410
With what?

42:08.410 --> 42:09.360
With whom?

42:09.360 --> 42:11.263
Oh, well, OK, with whom?

42:11.263 --> 42:13.680
See, my family's throwing
this party for my Uncle James,

42:13.680 --> 42:15.780
and I cannot handle it alone.

42:15.780 --> 42:16.950
Why not?

42:16.950 --> 42:18.850
Well, because I choose not to.

42:18.850 --> 42:19.830
Uh-huh.

42:19.830 --> 42:20.768
OK.

42:20.768 --> 42:21.810
I know what you're doing.

42:21.810 --> 42:24.030
I have work in the morning.

42:24.030 --> 42:27.930
Don't worry, I'll make sure
you're home before sunset.

42:27.930 --> 42:31.200
And you'll be doing
me a huge favor.

42:33.755 --> 42:37.010
Besides I bet that steno could
use some fresh air, being stuck

42:37.010 --> 42:40.940
in this stale courthouse
day in and day out,

42:40.940 --> 42:42.060
eternally tapped out.

42:42.060 --> 42:42.860
OK.

42:42.860 --> 42:45.570
Well, back by sunset, you say?

42:45.570 --> 42:46.370
I promise.

42:53.740 --> 42:56.080
Your family lives here?

42:56.080 --> 42:59.860
Yeah, for six generations.

42:59.860 --> 43:02.228

43:04.450 --> 43:07.430
Where you been hiding
that endearing smile?

43:07.430 --> 43:09.010
Oh.

43:09.010 --> 43:10.120
Come on.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.018
Let's meet the Duperon gang.

[CHATTERS]

43:22.764 --> 43:23.760
Hi.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.020
Nice to see you.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.110
Hi there.

- Hi!

43:28.640 --> 43:29.510
Hi.

43:29.510 --> 43:30.310
Hi.

43:32.600 --> 43:36.650
WALDEN: This truly is a majestic
residence Mr. And Mrs. Duperon.

43:36.650 --> 43:39.350
Well, thank you, Walden.

43:39.350 --> 43:43.800
Emily has told us absolutely
nothing about you.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.320
Where are you from?

43:45.320 --> 43:47.990
Over in Alexandria, ma'am.

43:47.990 --> 43:48.950
Alexandria?

43:48.950 --> 43:50.390
Dean?

43:50.390 --> 43:54.750
Say, you wouldn't happen to be
Jesse Dean's boy, would you?

43:54.750 --> 43:55.550
Yes, sir.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.110
I am.

43:57.110 --> 44:03.290
MR. DUPERON: Jesse Dean, he was
the mildest mannered, sweetest

44:03.290 --> 44:04.980
boy in our high school.

44:04.980 --> 44:05.780
Oh.

44:05.780 --> 44:07.683
Well, you went to high
school with my Dad?

44:07.683 --> 44:08.600
MR. DUPERON: Sure did.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.910
MRS. DUPERON: Oh.

44:10.910 --> 44:13.770
Shame what that wife
of his did to him.

44:13.770 --> 44:14.570
Oh.

44:14.570 --> 44:15.980
Mm.

44:15.980 --> 44:17.960
What she do?

44:17.960 --> 44:19.680
I don't want to be
gossiping none here.

44:19.680 --> 44:20.670
But let's just say--

44:20.670 --> 44:22.010
EMILY: Hey.
[OVERLAPPING SPEECH]

44:22.010 --> 44:22.910
OK.
OK.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.920
I think that's enough.

44:24.920 --> 44:25.820
I'm sorry.

44:25.820 --> 44:28.590
As you can see nosiness is
inherent within the Duperon

44:28.590 --> 44:29.725
family.

44:29.725 --> 44:30.525
Mm.

44:30.525 --> 44:31.470
I agree, honey.

44:31.470 --> 44:33.640
That's enough, Mitchell.

44:33.640 --> 44:35.940
Please forgive him, dear.

44:35.940 --> 44:40.200
Oh, no, no, no, your husband
is right, Mrs. Duperon.

44:40.200 --> 44:43.320
My mother did not adhere
to her marriage vows,

44:43.320 --> 44:45.090
as one would hope.

44:45.090 --> 44:47.340
She was something
of a loose woman,

44:47.340 --> 44:50.700
some would even say a whore.

44:50.700 --> 44:54.200
[EXHALES] Ah, and a very
successful one at that.

44:54.200 --> 44:55.640
If you'd excuse me.

45:03.160 --> 45:06.820
Walden, how do I
even begin to apologize

45:06.820 --> 45:08.920
for my father's ignorance?

45:08.920 --> 45:09.730
Oh, no.

45:09.730 --> 45:11.515
Never apologize for a truth.

45:15.590 --> 45:20.830
You know, this house
was given to my family.

45:20.830 --> 45:22.210
Yep.

45:22.210 --> 45:25.870
Apparently, we read
the entire surrounding

area of-- and you're never
going to believe this--

45:30.710 --> 45:32.350
Mm-hmm.

45:32.350 --> 45:35.680
I come from a long
line of snake charmers.

45:35.680 --> 45:40.760
[CHUCKLES] Well, tall
tales make short memories.

45:40.760 --> 45:43.990
[LAUGHS] Oh, I like that.

45:43.990 --> 45:45.580

45:45.580 --> 45:47.170
Walden Dean.

45:47.170 --> 45:49.300
Oh.

45:49.300 --> 45:54.330
You got any more masterful
quotes from Mr. Dean?

45:54.330 --> 45:56.400
Let me think, uhm.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.830
Two most important days in your
life are the day you're born--

45:59.830 --> 46:02.130
And the day you
find out why, OK.

46:02.130 --> 46:04.020
Are you just quoting
Mark Twain over there?

46:09.300 --> 46:10.230
Did you find out why?

46:13.670 --> 46:16.340
I didn't.

46:16.340 --> 46:18.560
Until recently.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.350
You're going to tell me?

46:21.350 --> 46:24.170
Another time.

46:24.170 --> 46:25.130
It's almost sunset.

46:33.375 --> 46:38.380
[SIGHS] Not quite
a stately mansion.

46:38.380 --> 46:42.350
Yeah, well, it is a home of
the great Savant Weldon Dean.

46:42.350 --> 46:44.640
Yeah.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.440
What?

46:48.880 --> 46:50.920
I was just thinking,
I never really

46:50.920 --> 46:54.670
put this down for that long.

46:54.670 --> 46:57.430
Thank you for the invitation.

46:57.430 --> 46:58.870
Really?

46:58.870 --> 47:03.220
After having to suffer my
father and his big old mouth?

47:03.220 --> 47:05.810
OK.

47:05.810 --> 47:07.730
Well, I'll see you
at the next round.

47:07.730 --> 47:08.990
Yeah.

47:08.990 --> 47:10.002
You broke your promise.

47:10.002 --> 47:11.585

me back by sunset.

everybody in Alexandria,

don't you?

47:54.890 --> 47:56.390

47:56.390 --> 48:00.960
I know where they all live,
and what they do for work.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.760
OK.

48:01.760 --> 48:04.940
You seen any strange
folk hanging around?

48:04.940 --> 48:07.760
People even you've
never met before?

48:07.760 --> 48:09.230
No.

48:09.230 --> 48:12.260
I don't see anybody
outside of anybody I know,

48:12.260 --> 48:13.820
Detective Billy.

48:13.820 --> 48:17.750
If I did, I would
remember them, then they

48:17.750 --> 48:21.667
wouldn't be strangers no more.

48:21.667 --> 48:23.250
BILL: You'd tell us
if you did, right?

48:23.250 --> 48:24.150
GEORGE: Uh-huh.

48:24.150 --> 48:25.920
Sure would.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.860
SALLY: Hey, George, you
knew young Cal Pepper,

48:28.860 --> 48:30.660
didn't you, George?

48:30.660 --> 48:34.220
I don't know nothing
about what happened to Cal.

48:34.220 --> 48:36.630
Nothing.

48:36.630 --> 48:38.920
Hey, it's OK, George.

48:38.920 --> 48:39.720
OK?

48:39.720 --> 48:41.550
You have yourself a good day.

48:41.550 --> 48:44.380
Thank you.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.705
Today's court case is bad.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.600
Bad man.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.280
Very bad man.

48:57.230 --> 49:00.430
You saw that candy bar, right?

49:00.430 --> 49:02.060
Yep.

49:02.060 --> 49:03.500
I like candy bars, too.

49:06.090 --> 49:07.950
DEITRICH: Dr. Patel,
can you describe

49:07.950 --> 49:12.060
the condition you found Mr. Pym
in when you were attending him?

49:12.060 --> 49:15.000
He was in a very bad state.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.960
His heart had stopped, and
the brain had no function.

49:19.960 --> 49:23.520
Anything else
outstanding about Mr. Pym?

49:23.520 --> 49:27.390
MR. PATEL: Apart from the
cataracts in his eyes?

49:27.390 --> 49:28.190
It's over.

49:28.190 --> 49:29.960
MR. PATEL:
--Substantial bruising

49:29.960 --> 49:32.090
to his buttocks and his legs.

49:32.090 --> 49:35.480
His feet were badly
deformed from what looked

49:35.480 --> 49:37.010
like years of heavy bandaging.

49:37.010 --> 49:38.810
DEITRICH: Heavy bandaging?

49:38.810 --> 49:42.020
Any reason why his feet
were heavily bandaged?

49:42.020 --> 49:43.340
MR. PATEL: No.

49:43.340 --> 49:45.800
There was no history in
his chart showing any kind

49:45.800 --> 49:47.790
of problems in that area.

49:47.790 --> 49:49.820
So there was no real
explanation for such

49:49.820 --> 49:52.850
a sustained and
painful treatment.

49:52.850 --> 49:55.610
DEITRICH: Did you know, Dr.
Patel, that Mr Pym was not

49:55.610 --> 49:58.640
the only patient at the
blessed retirement facility

49:58.640 --> 50:01.670
to have sustained such
terrible injuries?

50:01.670 --> 50:04.460
MR. PATEL: There were
whispers about the BRF,

50:04.460 --> 50:05.940
but not much more than that.

50:05.940 --> 50:10.520
So you aren't aware that
Chief attending nurse, Katherine

50:10.520 --> 50:13.070
Mills, was overseeing
these patients,

50:13.070 --> 50:17.090
and was caught by the son of
one patient, a Mr. Andrews,

50:17.090 --> 50:19.370
slapping his father
across the face

50:19.370 --> 50:20.675
for not taking his medication?

50:20.675 --> 50:22.070
Objection, Your Honor!

50:22.070 --> 50:24.440
As bad as slapping anyone
across the face is,

50:24.440 --> 50:27.090
it doesn't rise to a
level of probable cause

50:27.090 --> 50:28.590
that my client
nurse Mills, who is

50:28.590 --> 50:31.830
25 years of impeccable service
in the medical profession,

50:31.830 --> 50:34.500
systematically tortured his
unfortunate patients who

50:34.500 --> 50:37.170
subsequently died from nothing
to do with bandaged feet

50:37.170 --> 50:38.010
or bruised buttocks.

50:38.010 --> 50:41.240
| of which can be explained with
justifiable medical reasoning.

50:41.240 --> 50:44.160
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but defense is deflecting

50:44.160 --> 50:47.100
from an observation of
violence, which clearly lends

50:47.100 --> 50:49.720
itself to a mode of behavior.

50:49.720 --> 50:52.960
Ms. Deitrich, did
anybody actually see

50:52.960 --> 50:56.740
nurse Mills binding
these poor people's feet

50:56.740 --> 50:59.080
or whipping them with a--

50:59.080 --> 51:01.660
Leather belt?

51:01.660 --> 51:04.390
No, Your Honor, no witnesses.

51:04.390 --> 51:06.190
I'm sorry, but I--

51:06.190 --> 51:09.670
I just can't see your
stretch of logic here.

51:09.670 --> 51:13.900
Owing to Chief nurse
Mills impeccable record,

51:13.900 --> 51:17.830
and the lack of
any probable cause,

51:17.830 --> 51:23.890
or actual evidence, no
eyewitnesses, no leather belt,

51:23.890 --> 51:27.790
I see no alternative, but to,
uh, grant the defense's motion

51:27.790 --> 51:29.230
for dismissal of all charges.

51:35.550 --> 51:38.970
Walden, how have
you been feeling?

51:38.970 --> 51:42.120
If it is, just want you
to know I'm here for you.

51:42.120 --> 51:44.280
Well, I told you the
other day, Judge, I mean,

51:44.280 --> 51:46.110
there's nothing wrong with me.

51:46.110 --> 51:51.240
Just stress, trying to impose
itself on my disposition.

51:51.240 --> 51:55.260
They're probably just trying to
beat that stupid steno record.

51:55.260 --> 51:57.960
Do yourself a favor, son,
and quit that damn competition

51:57.960 --> 51:59.160
right now.

51:59.160 --> 52:03.160
Well, I can't.

52:03.160 --> 52:06.160
I met someone there.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.560
A very nice young woman.

52:08.560 --> 52:11.140
Well, I will be damned.

52:11.140 --> 52:12.400
[CHUCKLES]

52:12.400 --> 52:14.050
How about that?

52:14.050 --> 52:15.760
Well, you sneaky son of a gun.

52:15.760 --> 52:17.140
Don't.

52:17.140 --> 52:21.205

He did, indeed.

to kill him so quickly,

to do something like that?

have appreciated

your avuncular
nature towards me,

as well as your
reassurances of being done,

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:07.120
I can't trust what you say
has a word of truth in it.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.660
And since you are
such a wicked man,

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.780
I feel obligated to Cal
and all the other children

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:21.840
you so cruelly murdered to send
you personally down to hell.

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:29.720
The burden is on me not
to enjoy my task too much.

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.730
But I must bear witness
to your earthly departure

01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:37.130
for the children.

01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:42.595
You can understand that,
can't you, Your Honor?

01:32:42.595 --> 01:32:43.395
For the children.

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.080
Fair enough.

01:32:59.650 --> 01:33:04.300
Walden, you are the
best damn stenographer I

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.898
have ever seen in a courtroom.

01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:52.050
Hi, detectives.

01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:54.510
BILL: Hey, Walden.

01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:55.380
Come on in.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.590
Thanks for keeping
it down, detectives.

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:09.288
My dad's just sleeping
on the couch there.

01:34:09.288 --> 01:34:10.830
You guys want any
coffee or anything?

01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:13.310
I'm just doing a little
bit of work here.

01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:15.320
It looks like you
got yourself a dog.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.460
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.780
My dad got me a puppy.

01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:22.040
He said he thought it would
help me get some exercise.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.030
BILL: Hey, Walden, if
you don't mind me asking,

01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:29.990
why did you just happen
to be in that alleyway

01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:31.640
on that particular night?

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.520
Oh.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.140
Just going for one
of my renowned walks.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.010
I hope those aren't
outlawed now.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:42.810
Are they?

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:43.610
[CHUCKLES]

01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:44.520
No.

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:47.230
No, it hasn't been outlawed.

01:34:47.230 --> 01:34:48.030
OK.

01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:52.840
Well, how was your
friend, by the way?

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.100
She's good.
WALDEN: Yeah?

01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.720
She's doing much better.
Yeah.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.040
Thanks for asking, Walden.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.428
Yeah.

01:34:58.428 --> 01:35:00.220
BILL: You know, the
good news is, you won't

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.050
be charged for what happened.

01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:05.000
Witnesses have come
forward on your behalf.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.650
They say it was self-defense.

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:12.320
Well, you're darn tootin'.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.150
It was self-defense.

01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:15.350
But witnesses?

01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.670
Uh-huh.

01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:19.910
Caring bystanders.

01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:22.452
Of course, we need to figure
out who took out Bolt and Mills,

01:35:22.452 --> 01:35:23.252
but--

01:35:23.252 --> 01:35:24.110
That's right.

01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:25.160
Mm.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.380
Yeah, man.

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:30.530
That is a mystery.

01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:32.840
Yeah.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:33.710
Yeah, it is.

01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:35.250
Mm-hmm.

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:43.520
Walden, you know, I hear
that problems in the head

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.020
can make people do crazy things.

01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:52.180
But then when the
head gets fixed,

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:57.670
all those crazy thoughts,
and those crazy things,

01:35:57.670 --> 01:36:00.230
they can just stop.

01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:03.240
You following me?

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.790
You're talking above
my pay grade, detective.

01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:07.680
I just write this
stuff for a living.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.248
I'll leave it to you
guys to figure it out.

01:36:10.248 --> 01:36:14.473
[CHUCKLES]

01:36:14.473 --> 01:36:15.890
We'll see ourselves
out, Walden.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:24.950

- Good night.

01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:25.750

So proud of you.

KINDLEMAN: The
case was dismissed,

01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:27.780
and the defendant left
the courtroom a free man.

01:37:34.110 --> 01:37:34.910

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.770
Shit.

01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:41.690
You were two away
from the world record.

01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:48.030
WALDEN (VOICEOVER): "The
accused over a two-year period

01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:51.480
is alleged to have murdered
seven different prostitutes

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.510
across the state.

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:56.630
The defendant denies
all charges and has

01:37:56.630 --> 01:37:58.940
entered a plea of not guilty.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:03.890
He will be released on
bond while awaiting trial."
