Thanks for driving me to the
library for story time, Brian.

00:38.155 --> 00:40.290
Today we're reading
The Very Hungry Caterpillar

00:40.324 --> 00:41.925
vs. The Human Centipede.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.760
I heard it's like
Alien vs. Predator.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.462
with a little bit more
butt eating.

00:45.495 --> 00:47.864
That does sound fun,
but what if I took you

00:47.897 --> 00:50.134
to a different
library today?
What?

00:50.167 --> 00:52.969
But I like my library.
I met Curious George there.

00:53.002 --> 00:54.904
Mom said he was a puppet,
but she's stupid.

00:54.938 --> 00:56.806
I'm just saying we should
go to the library

00:56.840 --> 00:58.308
at Quahog University

00:58.342 --> 01:00.244
and take your education
to a higher level.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.046
I guess I can try it.
I mean, I do want to get ahead.

01:03.079 --> 01:06.816
I don't want to end up like Meg,
doing sad one-woman shows.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.101
(quietly):
Whose fault is this?

01:25.135 --> 01:26.936
You're wearing a
garbage bag as a cape.

01:26.970 --> 01:27.971
Who do you think?

01:28.004 --> 01:31.007
Him?
Shh. She's
crushing it!

01:39.048 --> 01:41.418
Oh, yeah.
That's good library.

01:41.451 --> 01:44.688
Aw, you didn't come here for me;
you came to be a creep.

01:44.721 --> 01:46.156
Whatever.
You go do your thing.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.692
I'm gonna go watch that young
hotshot attorney over there

01:48.725 --> 01:50.960
who's clearly in the middle
of a movie montage.

01:50.994 --> 01:54.664
(upbeat soundtrack plays)

02:02.339 --> 02:05.209
STEWIE: Oh! He found it.
He's gonna win the case.

02:06.643 --> 02:07.944
(gunshot)

02:07.977 --> 02:10.214
STEWIE:
Oh, no. It was a '70s movie.

02:10.247 --> 02:12.249
(somber soundtrack plays)

02:20.590 --> 02:22.892
So, who you reading?
George Eliot.

02:22.926 --> 02:24.294
Ah, Georgie.

02:24.328 --> 02:25.562
I'm a big fan.

02:25.595 --> 02:26.863
I think he, uh...
She.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.233
...she said it best
when she said...

02:29.266 --> 02:31.968
"Bantam Press, 1851."

02:32.001 --> 02:33.403
(groans softly)

02:33.437 --> 02:35.171
Lumineers?
What?

02:35.205 --> 02:38.007
Hmm?
You just said "Lumineers"
with no context.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.143
(like Urkel):
Did I do that?

02:40.176 --> 02:41.511
Ugh!

02:42.679 --> 02:44.248
Tumblr?

02:46.850 --> 02:50.654
Wow, I've never seen someone go
oh for six in 15 minutes before.

02:50.687 --> 02:54.190
Just hard rejection
after hard rejection.

02:54.224 --> 02:56.192
(indistinct shouts)

02:56.226 --> 02:58.562
What's going on over there?
Looks like
a student rally.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.430
They probably forgot
to study for an exam,

03:00.464 --> 03:02.098
so they organized
a protest.

03:02.131 --> 03:04.000
In the '90s, you'd
just pull a fire alarm--

03:04.033 --> 03:05.335
now you hold a protest.

03:05.369 --> 03:08.372
That is, when they're not
looking down at their phones.

03:11.975 --> 03:13.677
Hey, what's going on?

03:13.710 --> 03:15.745
Someone wrote "weird" on
the transgender bathroom,

03:15.779 --> 03:17.747
and the school president
didn't overreact,

03:17.781 --> 03:19.283
so we want him fired!

03:19.316 --> 03:20.617
Seems reasonable.

03:20.650 --> 03:21.685
Exactly!

03:21.718 --> 03:23.186
Oh, I see
news cameras.

03:23.219 --> 03:27.691
I'm gonna yell "Viva la Stool"
like a young, white drunkard.

03:27.724 --> 03:30.260
And last week, a professor told
his class to have a nice day,

03:30.294 --> 03:31.361
which is microaggression,

03:31.395 --> 03:32.896
because in our
systemic rape culture

03:32.929 --> 03:34.764
no day is a nice day.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.300
So we want him fired, too.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.468
(chuckles): Hey,
if you don't want to get fired,

03:38.502 --> 03:40.236
don't become
a teacher, right?
Totally.

03:40.270 --> 03:42.639
You should tweet that.
#FireEveryone.

03:42.672 --> 03:44.073
STEWIE:
Viva la Stool!

03:44.107 --> 03:46.976
Well, I guess I could
fire up my account again.

03:47.010 --> 03:48.378
All right, open app.

03:48.412 --> 03:50.146
Got a bunch of those.
No biggie.

03:50.179 --> 03:51.548
Typing tweet.

03:51.581 --> 03:53.049
Blast off in three,

03:53.082 --> 03:54.618
two, one,

03:54.651 --> 03:56.386
and tweeted.

03:56.420 --> 03:58.955
I am back in the game. See?

03:58.988 --> 04:00.557
Oop, you're gone.

04:00.590 --> 04:02.258
And the crowd is gone.

04:02.292 --> 04:04.594
And the animators are gone.

04:08.632 --> 04:10.934
Hey, Stewie, what do you
think about this tweet?

04:10.967 --> 04:12.402
Oh, don't be that guy.

04:12.436 --> 04:14.404
"Kelly Ripa
no-shows at work."

04:14.438 --> 04:17.073
Who does she think she is,
a Republican senator?

04:17.106 --> 04:19.576
(chuckles)
#G-O-P-U.

04:19.609 --> 04:21.911
Three references in one
tweet. I'm sweating.

04:21.945 --> 04:24.080
I'll just add it
to my notes for later.

04:24.113 --> 04:25.749
Why are you
getting into Twitter now?

04:25.782 --> 04:28.618
Unless you're an athlete
or a celebrity, no one cares.

04:28.652 --> 04:30.420
A lot of people
like my stuff.

04:30.454 --> 04:32.922
Oh, yeah? Someone needs
to tell Donald Trump

04:32.956 --> 04:34.358
it's not fashionable

04:34.391 --> 04:36.326
to wear orange on your
face after Labor Day.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.994
#OompaTrumpa.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.929

Zero likes.

04:39.963 --> 04:41.665
Yeah, viral.
You know, I don't care.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.700
You can't stop me.
Just like people

04:43.733 --> 04:45.935
can't stop Peter
from ordering shepherd's pie.

04:45.969 --> 04:47.771
And what can I get
for you, sir?

04:47.804 --> 04:49.005
I'll have the
shepherd's pie.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.940
I'm sorry, but that's
not on the menu.

04:50.974 --> 04:52.609

just making a joke.

09:36.425 --> 09:38.762

I told you.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.764
Come on, he deleted
his tweet.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.566

in our hearts.

Peter, you better
get out of here

before I start
saying "sir" like a cop.

09:47.603 --> 09:49.172

Sir? Sir?

09:49.205 --> 09:50.674
You've been asked
to leave.

09:50.707 --> 09:52.408
Joe, it's me,
Peter. I...
Sir.

09:52.441 --> 09:54.577
I don't want to have
to ask you again.

09:54.610 --> 09:56.412
Please leave.
All right, fine.

09:56.445 --> 09:57.681
Sir!
No, Joe, Joe.

09:57.714 --> 09:58.748
He's leaving.
Sir!

09:58.782 --> 09:59.849
Joe, Joe...
Sir!

09:59.883 --> 10:00.917
He's gone.
Sir.

10:00.950 --> 10:02.485
It's okay.

It's a sensitivity mob.

10:18.001 --> 10:19.535
It was just a joke.

10:19.568 --> 10:21.637
There's no such thing
as jokes anymore.

10:21.671 --> 10:23.707
Yeah, we live in
a post-joke world.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.775
Chris, maybe we
should just eat outside.

10:25.809 --> 10:28.011
No, Meg,

13:50.513 --> 13:52.181
There's a huge difference.

13:52.215 --> 13:53.649
But nobody on the Internet
ever takes the time

13:53.682 --> 13:56.019

worth freaking out over?"

Or, "Are there bigger problems
in the world than this tweet?"

13:59.088 --> 14:00.523
Well, I assure you, there are.

14:00.556 --> 14:02.992

I love black people.

14:03.026 --> 14:04.727

So, what do you all
want from me, huh?

14:06.629 --> 14:07.730

14:07.763 --> 14:09.432
Then congratulations.
You did it.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.086
I am so far left,

14:30.119 --> 14:32.388
I'm spinning in
circles, you (bleep).

14:32.421 --> 14:35.058
Instead of killing myself,
I should kill all of you!

also haven't done much

is a drastic measure.
