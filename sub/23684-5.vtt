WEBVTT

00:03.241 --> 00:04.620
- Previously on
"Hit The Floor"...

00:04.689 --> 00:05.931
- This is my wife, Leah.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.344
- Your wife cheated
on you with a Devil.

00:07.413 --> 00:09.482
- Your player, Pax Lowe,
screwed my wife!

00:09.551 --> 00:10.965
I want him gone!

00:11.034 --> 00:13.896
- I don't care about money.
- What do you care about?

00:13.965 --> 00:15.241
- Greatness.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.551
- I'll do it.
I will transform you.

00:17.620 --> 00:18.862
100.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.965
- I don't know what you want.
- A truce.

00:21.034 --> 00:24.379
- That's too bad,
because I don't trust you.

00:24.448 --> 00:27.068
- You and Zero
were the "it" couple.

00:27.137 --> 00:28.482
What happened?

00:28.551 --> 00:31.413
- I'm not ready to do this.
- Bye, Jude.

00:31.482 --> 00:33.896
- What's your moves?
Show me.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.793
- Last night was interesting.
- That's a start.

00:41.862 --> 00:44.413
- A start
implies a continuation.

00:44.482 --> 00:47.758
- Since side bets
are all the rage,

00:47.827 --> 00:49.862
how about
we make one of our own?

00:49.931 --> 00:53.000
- Do you think I'm trouble?
- It's complicated, Eve.

00:53.068 --> 00:55.413
- It doesn't have to be.

00:55.482 --> 00:57.068
German.

01:21.034 --> 01:22.620
- Oh, Derek.

01:29.275 --> 01:32.034
- The water too hot?
- I like it hot.

02:03.517 --> 02:06.344
Last night was, uh...

02:10.413 --> 02:13.000
This morning was...

02:14.862 --> 02:17.310
- I'm glad you came by.

02:17.379 --> 02:19.275
- Me too.

02:22.068 --> 02:23.034
Eve--

02:27.586 --> 02:30.896
- Dress options for the
ISN Awards tomorrow night.

02:33.137 --> 02:34.206
Hello.

02:34.275 --> 02:36.379
- Hi.
- Here you go.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.758
- Ah, the ISNYs.

02:37.827 --> 02:39.448
The night
the sports world gathers

02:39.517 --> 02:41.379
to celebrate their greatness.

02:41.448 --> 02:44.551
Because gold medals, trophies,
and Heismans

02:44.620 --> 02:46.034
just aren't good enough.

02:46.103 --> 02:49.965
- You're not going?
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

02:51.655 --> 02:56.137
The Devils aren't nominated
for anything this year.

02:56.206 --> 03:00.172
- See, I step away for a
minute, and look what happens.

03:00.241 --> 03:03.620
I'll make sure the Devils
break the record next year.

03:05.724 --> 03:08.241
So who's the lucky guy?

03:08.310 --> 03:09.965
- No one yet.

03:10.034 --> 03:11.310
It's the awards tomorrow night,

03:11.379 --> 03:13.586
and I'm just
figuring out the dress.

03:13.655 --> 03:15.862
- I'm not going
with anyone, either.

03:17.482 --> 03:23.137
- Well, maybe sometimes
last minute works out.

03:23.206 --> 03:25.172
- Maybe it does.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.206
- Good move.
Come on, now.

03:37.448 --> 03:39.206
- All right, come on,
we hooping

03:39.275 --> 03:40.620
or "Dancing With The Stars"?

03:40.689 --> 03:42.137
- Come on, that joke
is as tired as you are.

03:42.206 --> 03:43.620
- Oh.
- Who got that rookie?

03:43.689 --> 03:45.275
- Nothing.
- Oh!

03:45.344 --> 03:47.551
- Hey.
- I'm making those, baby.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.724
- Come on, Smiley.
- What's up?

03:48.793 --> 03:50.689
- Why does this feel like--

03:50.758 --> 03:52.724
why does this feel like the
first day of kindergarten, man?

03:52.793 --> 03:54.172
I ain't even
going to lie to you.

03:54.241 --> 03:56.103
- Come on.
- I got it, hang on.

03:59.241 --> 04:01.862
- Hey, tell this rook
to close his legs, man.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.965
- It's luck.
- That's 6th grade, fam.

04:05.793 --> 04:07.517
- They just playing around...

04:07.586 --> 04:09.793
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?

04:09.862 --> 04:11.620
- I'm in the middle
of something right here.

04:11.689 --> 04:14.551
- I, uh, I meant what I said
about earning your trust,

04:14.620 --> 04:16.793
which is why I'm coming
to you with this.

04:18.310 --> 04:20.172
- The commissioner
is pressuring me

04:20.241 --> 04:22.137
to get rid of a player.

04:22.206 --> 04:25.241
Pax.

04:25.310 --> 04:26.965
- Why?

04:27.034 --> 04:31.827
- He slept with
the commissioner's wife.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.068
- Look,

04:33.137 --> 04:35.413
I am not interested
in Pax's personal life.

04:35.482 --> 04:37.586
I only care about
what happens on the court.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.517
I need him.

04:42.827 --> 04:45.862
Check up, check up.
Pax, ball at the top, ay, yo.

04:45.931 --> 04:47.482
When you pass that...

04:47.551 --> 04:50.172
- Jude picked a hell of a time
to break up with you.

04:50.241 --> 04:51.586
The ISNYs are tomorrow.

04:51.655 --> 04:53.758
- Lionel put me
on sideline duty there.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.793
I'll get to interview
Usain Bolt, Serena Williams,

04:56.862 --> 04:59.655
Dale Earnhardt Jr.--
- You mean harass.

04:59.724 --> 05:01.896
- I'm not going to blow it
by dwelling on an ouchie.

05:01.965 --> 05:04.068
Can I have
some of your noodles?

05:07.172 --> 05:09.586
- You really liked him.

05:11.758 --> 05:12.931
- Jude's not the first person

05:13.000 --> 05:15.206
who hasn't wanted
to be with me.

05:15.275 --> 05:16.965
The show must go on.

05:17.034 --> 05:19.379
- Preaching
to the choir, sister.

05:19.448 --> 05:21.620
- "Sister"?
We're doing that now?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.413
- We're workshopping it.

05:23.482 --> 05:24.827
That charity donation
from Derek

05:24.896 --> 05:26.620
wasn't the love letter
I thought it was,

05:26.689 --> 05:29.931
but I'm not letting it
throw me off my game, either.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.310
I'm going to do
what I came here to do,

05:32.379 --> 05:33.413
and that's crush.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.103
- That look on your face
terrifies me.

05:37.172 --> 05:39.517
What's going on in there?

05:39.586 --> 05:41.344
- Eyes on the prize.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.172
- Eyes on the prize.

05:47.896 --> 05:49.862
- The commissioner
wants Pax's head on a stick,

05:49.931 --> 05:51.344
but Derek says he needs him.

05:51.413 --> 05:53.034
So basically,
my two choices are

05:53.103 --> 05:55.896
to ruin my relationship
with the league

05:55.965 --> 05:58.344
or ruin my relationship
with my number one player.

05:58.413 --> 06:00.931
- Well, Derek
already hates you, so...

06:02.827 --> 06:04.793
I know you want
to keep Derek happy,

06:04.862 --> 06:06.827
but the commissioner
is a nightmare.

06:06.896 --> 06:08.413
If he says he's going
to make your life hell,

06:08.482 --> 06:10.655
then he will.

06:10.724 --> 06:13.689
Now, the ISNYs.

06:13.758 --> 06:16.586
You're presenting an award:
Rookie of the Year.

06:16.655 --> 06:17.862
You get it?

06:17.931 --> 06:19.275
They're a rookie.
You're a rookie.

06:19.344 --> 06:21.448
- My tux is at the cleaners.
- Pick it up

06:21.517 --> 06:23.896
and spit-shine your shoes,
because you're also my date.

06:23.965 --> 06:25.655
Noah's working the awards,
so you're free.

06:25.724 --> 06:28.068
- Well, I wouldn't
be going with Noah anyway.

06:28.137 --> 06:32.034
I ended whatever that was.
- Why?

06:32.103 --> 06:33.793
- Got complicated.

06:33.862 --> 06:37.517
- Noah's a lot of things.
Complicated isn't one of them.

06:40.586 --> 06:44.379
Okay, then.
I'll keep this simple.

06:44.448 --> 06:46.137
7:00 p.m. limo,
7:30 red carpet.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.620
I am wearing sapphire blue.
Don't clash.

06:48.689 --> 06:50.655
- Okay, except...

06:50.724 --> 06:52.517
I don't know
what sapphire blue is.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.655
- Google it.
And then Google Nancy Drew,

06:55.724 --> 06:57.482
so she can track down
your gay gene.

07:05.689 --> 07:07.655
- Hey.

07:07.724 --> 07:10.482
Buddy boy, are you in trouble.

07:10.551 --> 07:11.586
- What'd I do?

07:11.655 --> 07:13.517
- Not what.
Who.

07:13.586 --> 07:15.310
One of those Pink Panthers
you banged

07:15.379 --> 07:16.896
is the commissioner's wife.

07:16.965 --> 07:18.827
He found out about it,
and now he's out for blood.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.068
Yours.

07:20.137 --> 07:21.758
- I didn't know
that Leah was married.

07:21.827 --> 07:24.310
I definitely didn't know
that she was married to him.

07:24.379 --> 07:26.172
All right, hey, how was I
supposed to know who she was?

07:26.241 --> 07:27.517
You didn't even
know who she was.

07:27.586 --> 07:29.103
- Why me?
- You saw her

07:29.172 --> 07:32.896
at the arena, and you yelled
at me for talking to her.

07:32.965 --> 07:35.172
- Black Chanel bag,
red bottoms,

07:35.241 --> 07:37.620
makeup by Home Depot.
Yeah, I remember.

07:37.689 --> 07:39.758
- Why would Leah call me out?

07:39.827 --> 07:40.758
- I wasn't alone that day.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.379
I was with someone else.

07:43.448 --> 07:44.793
Eve Vincent.

07:44.862 --> 07:46.413
- From the commissioner's
office.

07:46.482 --> 07:47.827
- How you know Eve?

07:47.896 --> 07:50.896
- She came up to me
that day, actually.

07:50.965 --> 07:54.655
She's the one who told me
who Leah was married to.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.482
Do you think...

07:56.551 --> 07:58.517
- What I think is that
you should lay low.

07:58.586 --> 08:00.000
- The ISNYs are tomorrow.

08:00.068 --> 08:01.827
- You can watch from home
in your underwear,

08:01.896 --> 08:04.689
just like last year.
- What are you going to do?

08:04.758 --> 08:08.172
- What I always do:
work alone.

08:08.241 --> 08:10.172
Off you go.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.379
- London.

08:23.448 --> 08:27.068
- Who are you with?
- Rumor-or-real.com. Nate.

08:27.137 --> 08:29.275
Can I ask you a few questions?
- No comment.

08:29.344 --> 08:30.862
- So you have nothing to say

08:30.931 --> 08:33.517
about your romantic
relationship with Derek Roman?

08:35.793 --> 08:37.103
- My what now?

08:37.172 --> 08:38.758
- I was thinking about
something like

08:38.827 --> 08:40.344
"The Black Widow
Strikes Again."

08:40.413 --> 08:43.379
Is Derek Roman her next
high profile victim?

08:45.137 --> 08:47.896
- I don't have a romantic
relationship with Derek Roman.

08:47.965 --> 08:50.655
He's someone else's
mess to fix.

09:04.862 --> 09:06.758
- She denied it.

09:06.827 --> 09:08.862
- Well.

09:08.931 --> 09:11.172
There's your story.

09:21.206 --> 09:23.862
- All right,
good practice, fellahs.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.965
- What up, B?
- Yo.

09:28.344 --> 09:31.310
- How'd you like to
be my date to the ISNYs?

09:32.758 --> 09:34.275
- You want to go together?

09:34.344 --> 09:36.655
- Yeah, I'd rather go
with a friend.

09:36.724 --> 09:39.206
Won't have to worry about
anyone getting hands-y.

09:39.275 --> 09:43.000
- Actually, I was planning on
watching it in my underwear.

09:43.068 --> 09:45.103
- No one said
you had to dress up.

09:48.724 --> 09:50.965
- Let's do it.
- Great.

09:51.034 --> 09:52.275
The Devil Girls
are dancing at it.

09:52.344 --> 09:53.793
We have a run-through
before the show,

09:53.862 --> 09:56.206
so I'll see you there.

10:08.758 --> 10:10.931
- Derek, how's it going?

10:12.655 --> 10:14.137
- You look dapper.

10:14.206 --> 10:17.448
- The threats helped.

10:37.862 --> 10:40.448
- Lionel.
Great to see you again.

10:40.517 --> 10:43.034
- Commissioner.

10:43.103 --> 10:44.310
- I'm going to need a decision

10:44.379 --> 10:47.000
on Pax Lowe
by the end of the night.

10:50.758 --> 10:52.517
- Commissioner!
Over here, sir.

10:58.620 --> 10:59.965
- You don't have to do this.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.827
- This is exactly
what I have to do.

11:01.896 --> 11:03.241
You're a key part of my team.

11:03.310 --> 11:05.758
Whoever doesn't know that
needs to learn it.

11:11.517 --> 11:13.000
- Hey.

11:13.068 --> 11:15.344
Didn't think I'd ever
find you in this crowd.

11:15.413 --> 11:18.413
- Wow, you look...

11:18.482 --> 11:21.379
wow.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.448
- You're here together.
- Friends' night out.

11:26.758 --> 11:28.000
- Well, you killed it
in the vogue battle.

11:28.068 --> 11:30.241
Congrats.
- Your wallet helped.

11:32.862 --> 11:34.689
- I figured you could
use the win.

11:34.758 --> 11:38.448
- I felt like a winner.

11:38.517 --> 11:39.758
Shall we?

11:39.827 --> 11:42.517
- Let's do this.

11:56.379 --> 12:01.034
- I'm gone for a week,
and this happens?

12:01.103 --> 12:03.655
- You and German?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.482
- And me and Eve.

12:05.551 --> 12:08.482
Not at the same time.
- No, Eve?

12:08.551 --> 12:09.862
- Really?

12:09.931 --> 12:12.448
You don't think German's
more surprising?

12:12.517 --> 12:14.931
- Since when do you
dip in the lady pond?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.172
- It's not my first time
getting wet.

12:17.241 --> 12:19.206
- You'd think you would
have told me this,

12:19.275 --> 12:21.758
oh, I don't know,
during my coming out.

12:21.827 --> 12:23.206
- Nancy Drew's
clearly on the job,

12:23.275 --> 12:26.862
because you're
queening out on me right now.

12:26.931 --> 12:29.413
- Does this mean
I'm your hag now?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.827
- Hmm.

12:38.689 --> 12:41.896
- If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were jealous.

12:41.965 --> 12:44.275
- Who would I be jealous of?

12:44.344 --> 12:46.758
- I'm wondering the same thing.

13:06.551 --> 13:10.000
- Derek, someone could see.
- That is the fun part.

13:10.068 --> 13:13.068
Where you been?
- Prepping for the dance.

13:13.137 --> 13:15.344
- I could use
some prepping right now.

13:15.413 --> 13:18.413
- What does that even mean?
- No idea.

13:18.482 --> 13:19.862
Kiss me.

13:25.275 --> 13:28.689
- I have to go check on
the wardrobe for the dance.

13:28.758 --> 13:31.137
- I will be watching.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.206
- Hey, watch where you're--

13:48.655 --> 13:49.793
- Hey.
- Kyle.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.482
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh...looking fancy.

13:52.551 --> 13:55.137
- Uh-huh.
So when I said lay low,

13:55.206 --> 13:57.620
you thought I meant buy a tux,
get your teeth whitened,

13:57.689 --> 13:59.896
and show up at the biggest
award show of the year?

13:59.965 --> 14:02.827
- I also got my nails buffed.

14:02.896 --> 14:04.620
I wasn't going to come.
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.689 --> 14:07.758
- But then Jamie asked me
to be her date.

14:07.827 --> 14:10.482
- If she asked you to
jump off a bridge, would you?

14:10.551 --> 14:13.758
- Naked and on fire.

14:13.827 --> 14:15.758
Look, Jamie or not,
I had to come.

14:15.827 --> 14:17.551
I want to make things right
with the commissioner.

14:17.620 --> 14:20.068
- Then send him
an Edible Arrangement.

14:20.137 --> 14:22.517
Go home,
and let me handle this.

14:22.586 --> 14:24.689
I've already
pleaded your case to Jude.

14:24.758 --> 14:26.275
I was going to
work on the big man next.

14:26.344 --> 14:28.896
- I don't want you
to fight my battles.

14:28.965 --> 14:31.965
All right, and I need him to
know what kind of guy I am.

14:32.034 --> 14:34.862
- The kind that would sleep
with his wife for $20,000.

14:34.931 --> 14:36.344
He got it.
- The kind that wouldn't

14:36.413 --> 14:39.827
purposefully wreck a marriage.

14:39.896 --> 14:42.068
I have morals.

14:42.137 --> 14:43.517
- I need the license plate

14:43.586 --> 14:45.793
of that turnip truck
you just fell off of.

14:51.275 --> 14:55.206
Mm, hold tight.
I need to have a little chat.

14:55.275 --> 14:56.758
Hey.

14:56.827 --> 14:58.517
Stay out of trouble.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.172
- Kyle.
How's your night going?

15:13.241 --> 15:15.517
- Rough, to be honest.

15:15.586 --> 15:18.275
A friend of mine
is facing a pink slip.

15:18.344 --> 15:20.103
The end of
their career, really.

15:20.172 --> 15:22.862
Kind of a buzzkill.
- Mm, sorry to hear that.

15:22.931 --> 15:24.620
- It's Pax Lowe.

15:24.689 --> 15:28.206
Someone told the commissioner
he was sleeping with his wife.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.517
- Wild.
- Right?

15:30.586 --> 15:32.275
It made me think
of some other crazy things

15:32.344 --> 15:34.068
that have gone on
around here lately.

15:34.137 --> 15:37.137
Things no one could explain...

15:37.206 --> 15:38.482
like the brawl.

15:38.551 --> 15:40.965
I talked to one of
the dancers in Miami.

15:41.034 --> 15:43.827
Seems there were rumors there
of a whole bunch of trash talk

15:43.896 --> 15:46.241
Derek Roman
was supposedly doing.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.655
Rumors that came out of LA.

15:50.758 --> 15:52.586
- You don't say.

15:52.655 --> 15:54.068
- Well, Jelena
could have squashed them

15:54.137 --> 15:55.517
if she was around,

15:55.586 --> 15:57.310
but she was forced to
take Miguel God-knows-where

15:57.379 --> 16:00.241
because God-knows-who
sabotaged her custody.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.517
I tracked down Jesse,
the boy's daddy.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.241
Turns out the person
who called him

16:04.310 --> 16:07.655
and got him
all worked up over Jelena...

16:07.724 --> 16:08.862
was you.

16:10.862 --> 16:12.206
- I can explain.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.965
- I didn't come in here
for a touch-up.

16:29.137 --> 16:31.758
- The Devils
took everything from me.

16:31.827 --> 16:36.724
My childhood,
my mother, my father.

16:36.793 --> 16:38.517
I can't let them
get away with it.

16:38.586 --> 16:39.793
I won't.

16:39.862 --> 16:41.379
- I know you've had
some tough things happen--

16:41.448 --> 16:43.551
- This isn't just about me.

16:43.620 --> 16:47.655
Kyle, you've worked
for the Devils for years.

16:47.724 --> 16:50.724
You know what's gone down
inside that arena--

16:50.793 --> 16:53.068
how many lives
have been ruined.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.724
Enough is enough.

16:55.793 --> 16:58.931
The Devils are going down...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.896
but you don't have to.

17:01.965 --> 17:05.448
The dancers have always been
close to my mother's heart,

17:05.517 --> 17:07.896
and you've taken
good care of them.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.103
I can take care of you.

17:15.896 --> 17:18.172
- How?

17:18.241 --> 17:21.758
- LA will have
a team next season.

17:21.827 --> 17:24.448
It just won't be the Devils.

17:24.517 --> 17:28.344
You can keep
the dancers together here

17:28.413 --> 17:32.793
and get that cut
you've been trying for.

17:32.862 --> 17:36.103
Two of the owners
already denied you of it.

17:36.172 --> 17:39.206
I can make it happen.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.827
- Own a stake
in the dance team?

17:40.896 --> 17:42.310
- It's time people
started getting

17:42.379 --> 17:44.000
what they deserve around here.

17:44.068 --> 17:45.758
Don't you agree?

18:15.862 --> 18:18.206
- Hey, you and I,
we should talk.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.482
- Commissioner, sir,
just a second of your time.

18:22.551 --> 18:24.000
- Walk away.
- I will.

18:24.068 --> 18:26.413
But first...

18:26.482 --> 18:28.896
I had to apologize to you.

18:28.965 --> 18:31.000
I didn't know Leah was married.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.793
That is a line I would
never cross, and...

18:34.862 --> 18:37.689
job or no job--although
I'd still like to keep mine--

18:37.758 --> 18:39.620
I needed to say that.

18:39.689 --> 18:42.793
Man to man,
for what it's worth.

18:44.275 --> 18:47.275
Man to man?

18:47.344 --> 18:49.379
I'll see to it
that you never play

18:49.448 --> 18:51.379
professional basketball again.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.827
For what it's worth.

18:59.241 --> 19:01.965
- Ladies and gentleman,
please take your seats.

19:02.034 --> 19:04.931
The show is about to begin.

19:07.172 --> 19:09.655
- How many people can say
they had their first date

19:09.724 --> 19:12.413
sitting between
Irv Gotti and Gabby Douglas?

19:12.482 --> 19:14.137
- Is this a date?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.137
- Isn't it?

19:18.965 --> 19:22.137
Yeah, I'm actually
having a really great time.

19:22.206 --> 19:25.172
- You sound surprised.

19:25.241 --> 19:28.793
- Yeah, well, it's still new.

19:28.862 --> 19:33.034
Kind of unexpected, I guess.

19:33.103 --> 19:37.517
- I'm a fan of the unexpected.
Keeps things interesting.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.827
I'll get us another round.

19:49.965 --> 19:53.551
- That looked cozy.
- It's a, uh...

19:53.620 --> 19:56.344
recent development.

19:56.413 --> 19:59.137
- Is this a thing?

19:59.206 --> 20:00.793
- I don't know what it is.

20:00.862 --> 20:02.310
- I'd think you'd be
trying to stay

20:02.379 --> 20:04.862
as far away
from that as possible.

20:07.689 --> 20:10.206
- She's a tough one
to stay away from.

20:16.551 --> 20:18.758
- I almost wore that dress.

20:18.827 --> 20:21.034
- Mm, that I would have
liked to see.

20:22.827 --> 20:24.724
- Welcome back.
Where did you go?

20:24.793 --> 20:27.000
- Ugh, some golf thing.

20:27.068 --> 20:29.103
It's exhausting enough
having to pretend to care

20:29.172 --> 20:30.241
about one sport.

20:30.310 --> 20:32.206
There's, like, a thousand more.

20:32.275 --> 20:35.310
There's always some ball
to shove in some hole.

20:35.379 --> 20:37.310
- Well, you were missed.

20:39.413 --> 20:41.241
- Not too badly.

20:41.310 --> 20:46.137
You and German?
That's the choice you made?

20:46.206 --> 20:48.448
- I didn't know I had a choice.

20:50.862 --> 20:53.586
- I was just saying.
- Oh.

20:53.655 --> 20:59.034
- I should get back to my date.
Enjoy yours.

20:59.103 --> 21:01.758
- Here you go.

21:04.172 --> 21:07.000
- This one's for the fans!
Definitely for the fans.

21:07.068 --> 21:09.689
- Liar, liar.
- What are you talking about?

21:09.758 --> 21:11.517
- I saw you with that reporter,

21:11.586 --> 21:13.586
saying you and Derek
aren't hooking up.

21:13.655 --> 21:17.068
We both know that's not true.
- Oh, do we?

21:18.793 --> 21:22.827
- Why not just claim him?
What are you afraid of?

21:22.896 --> 21:24.620
- I'm not afraid of anything.

21:24.689 --> 21:27.448
You're the one that's afraid of
what I might have with Derek.

21:27.517 --> 21:29.586
Interesting that
everything I have

21:29.655 --> 21:32.172
is everything you want.

21:32.241 --> 21:33.965
Seems to be a pattern.

21:34.034 --> 21:35.827
- You think?

21:35.896 --> 21:37.413
Well.

21:39.137 --> 21:41.000
Watch your step.

21:41.068 --> 21:45.068
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the Los Angeles Devil Girls.

23:57.448 --> 24:00.689
- Ready to go.

24:00.758 --> 24:03.068
- Ready?

24:03.137 --> 24:06.206
- Oh, you're doing this?
- Yeah.

24:06.275 --> 24:09.241
Is that okay?
- Of course.

24:11.310 --> 24:14.448
You know, interviews
aren't my favorite.

24:14.517 --> 24:17.000
You have any pointers?

24:17.068 --> 24:19.689
- Just be yourself,
and I'll take it from there.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.827
- Okay.

24:24.034 --> 24:26.068
- Rolling.
- Jude,

24:26.137 --> 24:28.310
the Devils didn't have
a chance in hell this season.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.137
Now you're fourth
in the Western Conference.

24:30.206 --> 24:32.172
What do you think of your
chances in the playoffs?

24:32.241 --> 24:33.689
- If we got out
of the first round,

24:33.758 --> 24:35.379
I feel like it's anyone's game.

24:35.448 --> 24:39.137
- How does it feel
being a virgin owner?

24:39.206 --> 24:41.448
Most first times involve a lot
of fumbling in the dark,

24:41.517 --> 24:44.275
followed by
self-loathing and regret...

24:44.344 --> 24:45.689
or is that just me?

24:45.758 --> 24:47.275
- Well, hopefully,
people will be calling

24:47.344 --> 24:48.655
to congratulate me,

24:48.724 --> 24:50.379
and not because
I gave them syphilis.

24:51.793 --> 24:53.034
Good luck presenting
Rookie of the Year.

24:53.103 --> 24:54.586
- Thanks, and fingers crossed

24:54.655 --> 24:56.758
I don't trip
on my way to the stage.

24:56.827 --> 24:58.137
- Would you?
I'm running low of GIFs,

24:58.206 --> 24:59.655
and there's only so many times

24:59.724 --> 25:01.310
I can use Wendy Williams
face-planting.

25:01.379 --> 25:03.586
- I'll see what I can do...

25:03.655 --> 25:05.551
for you.

25:08.620 --> 25:09.862
- Cut.

25:09.931 --> 25:12.482
- Not bad, huh?

25:14.379 --> 25:15.896
- You did great.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.931
Take care, Jude.

25:33.862 --> 25:35.275
- These swag bags are lit.

25:35.344 --> 25:37.172
Shower speakers,
an Apple watch...

25:37.241 --> 25:39.000
I don't know what
a carbon fiber pen is,

25:39.068 --> 25:41.448
but I'm sure as hell
going to sell it on Craigslist.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.689
What's your problem, dude?

25:47.896 --> 25:51.034
It's going to
come out soon anyway.

25:51.103 --> 25:53.655
I'm...

25:53.724 --> 25:55.793
on the chopping block.

25:57.965 --> 26:01.931
That guy wants me off the team.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.965
- That's like,
the grand pooh-bah.

26:04.034 --> 26:05.448
What did you do?

26:05.517 --> 26:09.000
- Let's just say I made
some bad decisions

26:09.068 --> 26:11.689
when I first got here...

26:11.758 --> 26:14.034
rubbed some people
the wrong way.

26:16.689 --> 26:19.689
- Hey, excuse me.
You see that guy right there?

26:19.758 --> 26:21.310
- The commissioner?
- Mm-hmm.

26:21.379 --> 26:24.034
I'll give you 50 bucks for
every tire of his you drain.

26:24.103 --> 26:27.655
- Jamie!
- The way he tips? I'm in.

26:29.586 --> 26:30.896
You're crazy.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.586
- And you're
the hardest-working person

26:32.655 --> 26:35.137
in that arena--
well, second hardest.

26:35.206 --> 26:37.551
Anybody who doesn't see that
deserves to walk home.

26:38.689 --> 26:39.931
- PS, it's supposed to rain.

26:54.620 --> 26:56.586
- "Derek Roman is
someone else's mess to fix."

27:00.896 --> 27:03.413
- I didn't have a choice.
- Really?

27:03.482 --> 27:05.103
Because I could have
thought of a whole bunch

27:05.172 --> 27:07.137
that didn't involve
you trashing me.

27:07.206 --> 27:09.724
- I was cornered.
I had to put a lid on it.

27:09.793 --> 27:11.896
You and I, we're like...

27:11.965 --> 27:13.620
these larger-than-life
scandal magnets.

27:13.689 --> 27:16.413
- Who put us together
in the first place?

27:16.482 --> 27:18.758
How did that reporter
even know?

27:18.827 --> 27:20.620
- It doesn't matter.

27:20.689 --> 27:23.517
It would have came out
eventually anyway.

27:23.586 --> 27:25.724
- Okay, so who cares?

27:25.793 --> 27:28.655
Who cares about the story?
Who cares about people talking?

27:28.724 --> 27:29.965
- I care.

27:30.034 --> 27:31.655
I don't want to be
the black widow

27:31.724 --> 27:33.103
for you and drag you down.

27:33.172 --> 27:35.896
- You mean you don't
want to drag you down.

27:35.965 --> 27:38.413
- Okay, both.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.310
I don't want to get
thrown into a hole

27:40.379 --> 27:43.448
I just finished
digging myself out of.

27:43.517 --> 27:47.000
It's dark.
I'm not going back there.

27:50.724 --> 27:55.068
Us staying together
will hurt us both.

27:55.137 --> 27:58.689
It'll hurt what each of us
are trying to do.

27:58.758 --> 28:01.448
- Look, if this is
what you want,

28:01.517 --> 28:03.793
there's nothing
I can say about it.

28:28.310 --> 28:30.517
- Coming right up.

28:30.586 --> 28:32.068
- Having fun?

28:32.137 --> 28:35.517
- Are you?
Your date is lovely.

28:35.586 --> 28:38.241
- You weren't around
to ask to this.

28:38.310 --> 28:40.862
- Would you have?

28:40.931 --> 28:42.241
- I would.

28:42.310 --> 28:44.172
Would you have accepted?

28:44.241 --> 28:46.172
- I guess we'll never know.

28:48.931 --> 28:51.862
- I drove your Mercedes here.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.000
She rides like a dream.

28:55.482 --> 28:58.551
- I know exactly how she rides.

28:58.620 --> 29:01.620
Oh, the things we've shared.
- Here you are, ma'am.

29:01.689 --> 29:03.689
Sir, for you.

29:12.931 --> 29:15.758
- Got a light?

29:15.827 --> 29:17.724
- Oh, I don't smoke.

29:17.793 --> 29:19.068
- Neither do I.

29:19.137 --> 29:21.448
I was just making conversation.

29:21.517 --> 29:25.137
I just came into 200 bucks,
and there's nothing

29:25.206 --> 29:27.275
I'd rather do than to
spend it on you.

29:27.344 --> 29:31.689
Dinner, drinks.
What do you say?

29:33.344 --> 29:34.620
Unless you got a boyfriend,

29:34.689 --> 29:36.862
we can skip out of here
right now.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.172
- That would be
a hasty decision.

29:43.137 --> 29:45.034
And I may have just made one.

29:57.655 --> 29:59.965
- Where's that
Derek Roman swagger?

30:00.034 --> 30:02.172
London take off with it?

30:02.241 --> 30:04.310
- Mm, you read
we were together.

30:04.379 --> 30:06.758
- And I knew
you'd wind up apart.

30:06.827 --> 30:08.793
- This is why
you've been shading me.

30:08.862 --> 30:10.310
- No.

30:10.379 --> 30:12.689
What gross well
you dip your bucket in

30:12.758 --> 30:14.413
is none of my business.

30:14.482 --> 30:16.931
I've been shading you because
of how you treated me.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.827
- What are you talking about?

30:18.896 --> 30:20.310
- All the attention...

30:20.379 --> 30:24.172
at your party, at your poker
game, around the arena?

30:24.241 --> 30:26.793
Laying out that cash for me
to win the vogue battle.

30:26.862 --> 30:30.241
- I was trying to help you out.
I know you've taken some hits.

30:30.310 --> 30:32.827
- Don't pity me.
Pity yourself

30:32.896 --> 30:34.310
because you don't see
what I do.

30:34.379 --> 30:37.172
- What's that?
Educate me.

30:37.241 --> 30:40.241
- There's a reason
you slept with London first.

30:40.310 --> 30:41.724
She's the rebound girl.

30:41.793 --> 30:44.000
The one you don't have to worry
about strings with.

30:44.068 --> 30:48.413
I come with strings,
and you know it.

30:48.482 --> 30:51.137
Pity doesn't make a man
look at a woman

30:51.206 --> 30:53.310
the way I've seen you
look at me.

30:53.379 --> 30:56.827
I'm no rebound,
and that scares you.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.896
I'm end game.

31:24.586 --> 31:26.896
- I don't know what
the big struggle is.

31:26.965 --> 31:29.379
At the end of the day,
there's one scary commissioner.

31:29.448 --> 31:31.551
Rookies are a dime a dozen.
Just lose Pax.

31:31.620 --> 31:34.034
- It's not that simple.
- Sure it is.

31:34.103 --> 31:36.172
Look how fast you lost Noah.

31:36.241 --> 31:37.620
- What do they
have to do with each other?

31:37.689 --> 31:39.793
- Pax is new
just like Noah's new.

31:39.862 --> 31:41.310
They're disposable.

31:41.379 --> 31:43.137
I can point to six people
in this audience

31:43.206 --> 31:46.344
who could take Pax's place,
just like I could point

31:46.413 --> 31:48.482
to three hot volleyball players
in that room

31:48.551 --> 31:50.172
that could take Noah's.

31:50.241 --> 31:53.172
The redhead has already
smiled at you twice.

31:55.689 --> 31:57.965
- Look, new does not
equal disposable.

31:58.034 --> 31:59.896
Everything epic
started off as new.

31:59.965 --> 32:01.758
It's like, sometimes,
when you meet someone,

32:01.827 --> 32:03.896
even if you've only known them
for five minutes,

32:03.965 --> 32:06.724
you just know you don't
want to let them go.

32:06.793 --> 32:10.793
Maybe it's about being
brave enough to hold on.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.931
- So hold on.

32:17.034 --> 32:18.965
- I need to find Noah--now.

32:19.034 --> 32:21.137
- You're presenting an award
in 15 minutes.

32:21.206 --> 32:22.448
Besides, I already
sent him home.

32:22.517 --> 32:25.379
- When?
- Ten minutes ago.

32:52.655 --> 32:54.862
- Jude?

32:54.931 --> 32:56.896
- I'm scared.

32:56.965 --> 32:58.896
I'm scared that what
happened to me before

32:58.965 --> 33:00.758
will happen again.

33:00.827 --> 33:04.206
I'm not brave, Noah.
Not like you.

33:04.275 --> 33:07.931
Not when it comes to this...
stuff, okay?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.965
I'm just...

33:10.034 --> 33:11.965
I'm scared to death.

33:12.034 --> 33:15.896
But I want to take
this chance with you.

33:15.965 --> 33:17.448
I want to be brave.

33:26.655 --> 33:28.551
- This is how you start.

33:38.275 --> 33:41.517
- That's a good one.
- No, in all seriousness,

33:41.586 --> 33:43.931
it is a very important award.
Six-man is the...

33:44.000 --> 33:47.482
- We need to talk, D-Ro.
- About what?

33:47.551 --> 33:49.241
- Eve Vincent.

33:49.310 --> 33:51.206
- What about her?

33:53.586 --> 33:55.379
- I needed tonight.

33:57.793 --> 34:01.862
To be honest,
being here with you...

34:06.344 --> 34:08.517
I don't have
a lot of people in my life.

34:10.793 --> 34:16.620
I have my dad, but he's
not the man he used to be.

34:20.413 --> 34:23.000
It can get lonely.

34:26.137 --> 34:28.000
But not tonight.

34:34.448 --> 34:36.586
- Look, there's something
I need to say.

34:36.655 --> 34:38.103
- Whatever the hell
that you think

34:38.172 --> 34:40.275
you're doing, you're done.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.206
Game the hell over.

34:51.689 --> 34:54.310
- What the hell is going on?
- Ask her.

34:54.379 --> 34:56.241
- Eve?

34:56.310 --> 34:57.655
- I don't know
what you think you know.

34:57.724 --> 34:58.931
- Only what Kyle told me.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.068
Do you want to tell him,
or should I?

35:02.137 --> 35:03.586
- German.

35:03.655 --> 35:05.379
- Eve's been playing us.

35:05.448 --> 35:08.068
She's had it out for the Devils
since the day she got here.

35:08.137 --> 35:10.827
Jelena leaving, the brawl,

35:10.896 --> 35:13.206
siccing the commissioner
on Pax--it's all her.

35:13.275 --> 35:14.448
- Is that true?

35:14.517 --> 35:16.068
- I'm doing what
needs to be done.

35:16.137 --> 35:20.413
The organization you work for
hurts people, hurt me.

35:20.482 --> 35:22.448
- So you're just
going to take us all down?

35:22.517 --> 35:24.758
- Devil's Arena is a hellmouth.

35:24.827 --> 35:27.034
My parents kept me away,
because they knew

35:27.103 --> 35:30.206
whoever steps inside
leaves their souls at the door.

35:30.275 --> 35:33.344
- And here you are, wiping
your feet on the welcome mat.

35:33.413 --> 35:35.827
- Eve...

35:35.896 --> 35:38.000
- I don't want
to hurt you, German.

35:38.068 --> 35:40.931
You're the one person
that place hasn't gotten to.

35:42.689 --> 35:46.413
Because of the Devils,
my mother is in the ground

35:46.482 --> 35:48.344
and my father might as well be.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.137
What happened
to Olivia and Chase

35:50.206 --> 35:52.689
is because of Olivia and Chase.
They brought it on themselves.

35:52.758 --> 35:55.827
- You shut your mouth.
- Your mother couldn't.

35:55.896 --> 35:58.689
She was a blackmailer.
She pushed and pushed.

35:58.758 --> 36:00.413
Eventually, someone
was going to push back.

36:00.482 --> 36:03.517
Olivia Vincent
dug her own grave.

36:03.586 --> 36:06.379
- How dare you?
- You don't need justice.

36:06.448 --> 36:08.000
You need a shrink...

36:08.068 --> 36:09.931
to deal with the fact
that your parents

36:10.000 --> 36:13.655
chose a life in "the hellmouth"
instead of a life with you.

36:32.758 --> 36:36.517
- What is this?
The queen with no king?

36:38.862 --> 36:41.172
- Maybe you wouldn't
find my life so interesting

36:41.241 --> 36:43.827
if you got one of your own.

36:43.896 --> 36:46.689
- Hitting the open bar hard,
I see.

36:46.758 --> 36:48.827
You were right
about one thing, though.

36:48.896 --> 36:52.379
We both do seem
to want the same things.

36:52.448 --> 36:56.172
The difference is,
I'm still in the game.

36:56.241 --> 36:58.172
Checkmate.

37:06.931 --> 37:09.586
- 30 seconds.
I know.

37:09.655 --> 37:11.137
Jude's not answering.

37:11.206 --> 37:13.310
See if one of those
snowboarders is sober enough

37:13.379 --> 37:15.000
to hand out the award.

37:15.068 --> 37:16.620
- I'm here.

37:16.689 --> 37:19.310
- Nice of you to join us.

37:19.379 --> 37:21.448
You can't go out
there like that.

37:21.517 --> 37:23.275
- Watch me.

37:23.344 --> 37:26.724
- Now welcome Los Angeles
Devils owner, Jude Kinkade.

37:35.551 --> 37:37.241
- Good evening.

37:37.310 --> 37:40.172
I'm honored to present
the Rookie of the Year award.

37:44.172 --> 37:47.758
Next year, it will be Pax Lowe
accepting this award,

37:47.827 --> 37:50.448
after he helps take the Devils
all the way this season.

37:53.103 --> 37:56.034
But now,
this year's nominees are...

37:56.103 --> 37:58.689
- Does that mean...
- I think it does.

38:11.758 --> 38:14.448
- You said you wanted my trust.

38:14.517 --> 38:16.896
And with that, you got it.

38:16.965 --> 38:18.689
Now, there's someone
we can't trust:

38:18.758 --> 38:20.448
Eve Vincent.

38:20.517 --> 38:22.068
She's had a hard-on
for the Devils.

38:22.137 --> 38:24.551
She sicced the commissioner
on you and Miami on me.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.758
- You made
the wrong decision, Jude.

38:26.827 --> 38:28.724
I have the backing
of other owners.

38:28.793 --> 38:30.310
I will personally see to it

38:30.379 --> 38:33.482
that this is the last season
the Devils ever play.

38:33.551 --> 38:35.206
- You'll do no such thing,

38:35.275 --> 38:39.310
or I'll broadcast your wife's
dirty laundry on ISN 24/7.

38:42.172 --> 38:44.137
That's a hard one
to recover from.

38:46.965 --> 38:49.137
- I've been the one
protecting you

38:49.206 --> 38:50.689
from the other owners
who've been wanting

38:50.758 --> 38:52.862
another team in LA.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.413
That protection is over.

38:54.482 --> 38:56.655
The only thing that will save
the Devils from extinction

38:56.724 --> 39:00.517
is a title.

39:00.586 --> 39:02.724
Ball's in your court.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.137
- You deserve
to go down with the rest.

39:14.206 --> 39:17.862
- Honey, I've gone down
plenty of times.

39:17.931 --> 39:19.310
- You fooled us all.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.655
- We won't let you
get away with it.

39:26.724 --> 39:28.724
- Count on that.

39:34.586 --> 39:36.793
- You do your worst.

39:38.206 --> 39:39.482
And I'll do mine.

39:49.758 --> 39:51.068
- Next time,
on "Hit the Floor".

39:51.137 --> 39:52.862
- It's triple digits
in the streets,

39:52.931 --> 39:54.620
and absolutely scorching
inside Devil's Arena.

39:54.689 --> 39:55.931
- The heat's gotten to you.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.793
- Kyle, surprise.
I'm back, baby.

39:59.862 --> 40:02.724
- I flew out from New York
to see the game...and you.

40:02.793 --> 40:05.206
We need you ASAP.

40:05.275 --> 40:08.034
- Do you think it's possible
that you could love again?

40:08.103 --> 40:09.517
- Yeah.

40:09.586 --> 40:11.000
- She's been quiet.

40:11.068 --> 40:14.137
In my experience,
that can be a very bad thing.

40:14.206 --> 40:16.275
- Hello, Oscar.

40:16.344 --> 40:18.689
- Eve.
