- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

05:01.526 --> 05:03.445
DINESH D'SOUZA:
When I was a boy,

05:03.570 --> 05:05.447
I was fascinated
with the world.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.954
I wondered why nations live

05:13.079 --> 05:15.206
and nations die.

05:16.290 --> 05:17.958
How do you kill a nation?

05:18.083 --> 05:22.254
Like Germany-- it destroyed
several other nations

05:22.379 --> 05:25.965
before being destroyed itself
at the end of World War II.

05:26.091 --> 05:28.801
Even powerful empires perish.

05:28.927 --> 05:31.888
Where's the Roman Empire today?

05:33.180 --> 05:35.057
Or the Soviet Union?

05:35.182 --> 05:38.644
Nations can be destroyed
from the outside,

05:38.769 --> 05:41.021
by invasion and conquest,

05:41.146 --> 05:44.107
or they implode from within,

05:44.232 --> 05:46.860
by losing
what makes them distinctive.

05:51.197 --> 05:55.159
I wonder if that
could ever happen to America.

06:01.790 --> 06:05.460
When I first came to America
as a 17-year-old,

06:05.585 --> 06:08.838
I knew I was coming
to a special place.

06:10.381 --> 06:13.092
I didn't know much
about the Constitution,

06:13.217 --> 06:15.427
the Bill of Rights,
any of that.

06:15.553 --> 06:18.180
I liked it here
because I liked the people.

06:18.305 --> 06:20.265
I saw Americans as independent,

06:20.390 --> 06:23.727
hardworking, self-reliant.

06:23.852 --> 06:27.647
Americans are
fiercely individualistic,

06:27.772 --> 06:31.651
but they're also fiercely
attached to family and faith,

06:31.776 --> 06:34.904
to community and to country.

06:35.029 --> 06:37.740
That's what the national anthem
symbolizes-- and the flag--

06:37.865 --> 06:41.827
that we 're one country
and we 're in this together.

06:41.952 --> 06:45.580
This is the America
I know and love.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.166
But can it last?

06:50.793 --> 06:53.296
PROTESTERS:
America was never great!

06:53.421 --> 06:56.131
- Slavery, genocide and war!
- D'SOUZA: There are those

06:56.257 --> 07:00.135
in America who want to end
the America we love.

07:00.260 --> 07:04.723
They believe America is defined
by class oppression...

07:04.848 --> 07:07.600
- Tear it down! Tear it down!
-...and white supremacy.

07:07.725 --> 07:10.186
They want, in Obama's phrase,

07:10.311 --> 07:12.855
to remake America.

07:12.980 --> 07:16.567
For this to happen,
America as we know it must die.

07:18.152 --> 07:19.570
Who will stop them?

07:21.446 --> 07:22.823
Wow, what a crowd!

07:22.948 --> 07:24.407
REPORTER: Billionaire
Donald Trump is hitting

07:24.532 --> 07:26.576
the presidential
campaign trail.

07:26.701 --> 07:29.495
Yep, he says
he may run for president.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.331
Do it. D-Do it.

07:32.456 --> 07:34.792
L-Look at me. Do it!

07:34.917 --> 07:37.378
Ann, which Republican candidate
has the best chance

07:37.503 --> 07:39.546
of winning
the general election?

07:39.671 --> 07:42.632
Of the declared ones,
right now, Donald Trump.

07:46.511 --> 07:48.012
He might be leading
the Republican ticket.

07:48.137 --> 07:49.514
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:
Next...

07:49.639 --> 07:52.350
I know you don't believe that,
but I want to go onto...

07:52.475 --> 07:54.351
There's not gonna be
a President Donald Trump.

07:54.477 --> 07:56.937
Um... that's not gonna happen.

07:57.062 --> 07:59.439
Donald Trump is not going to be
president of the United States.

07:59.565 --> 08:01.441
- Take it to the bank.
I guarantee it. -Okay.

08:01.566 --> 08:02.484
All right, all right.

08:02.609 --> 08:07.071
Well, @realDonaldTrump,
at least I will go down

08:07.197 --> 08:09.407
as a president.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.159
D'SOUZA: Everyone had
a good laugh at Trump

08:11.284 --> 08:14.662
<i>-but not the American people.
- USA! USA!</i>

08:14.787 --> 08:16.956
REPORTER: 20,000 people
turned out last night

08:17.081 --> 08:18.957
at a football stadium
in Mobile, Alabama,

08:19.082 --> 08:21.084
to hear Republican
front-runner Donald Trump.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.170
Man, I feel like
a billionaire already.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.505
Show 'em how many people come
to these rallies!

08:25.630 --> 08:27.841
Turn 'em! Go ahead, turn 'em!

08:27.966 --> 08:30.051
Go ahead!

08:30.176 --> 08:33.261
D'SOUZA: Trump and his voters
had a bond.

08:33.386 --> 08:35.931
We have a movement
like they've never seen before.

08:36.056 --> 08:37.808
So, right now, we have...
Hillary's about a 75%

08:37.933 --> 08:39.226
or an 80% favorite.

08:39.351 --> 08:40.769
- We have different versions
of forecast. -That high?

08:40.894 --> 08:42.520
Is it fun to be
at a Trump rally?!

08:42.645 --> 08:45.065
I mean, is this the greatest?!

08:45.190 --> 08:47.150
He's just not gonna win the
general election in this mode.

08:47.275 --> 08:49.277
Not even close.

08:49.402 --> 08:51.154
The hell we can't.

08:55.616 --> 08:58.035
D'SOUZA: They believed Trump
would fight for their America.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.495
Such a nasty woman.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.079
D'SOUZA:
So they stayed with him,

09:01.204 --> 09:02.789
and it drove the left nuts.

09:02.914 --> 09:05.166
REPORTER:
Chaos in the streets

09:05.292 --> 09:06.835
at a Donald Trump rally.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.128
If you can get 'em out,
get 'em out.

09:09.253 --> 09:11.214
None of us thought
we were gonna be here.

09:11.339 --> 09:12.590
But we are.

09:12.715 --> 09:14.175
D'SOUZA:
Especially her.

09:14.300 --> 09:17.303
Why aren't I 50 points ahead,
you might ask.

09:17.428 --> 09:20.889
D'SOUZA: Trump and his
supporters were in it together.

09:21.014 --> 09:24.809
I am your voice.

09:25.852 --> 09:27.228
I am with you.

09:27.353 --> 09:29.564
I will fight for you.

09:29.689 --> 09:32.191
And I will win for you.

09:32.316 --> 09:34.360
We will make

09:34.485 --> 09:38.363
America strong again.

09:38.489 --> 09:40.782
We will make

09:40.907 --> 09:43.785
America proud again.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.787
We will make

09:45.912 --> 09:49.582
America safe again.

09:49.707 --> 09:53.169
And we will make America
great again!

09:53.294 --> 09:54.170
God bless you,

09:54.295 --> 09:56.088
and good night!

09:56.213 --> 09:58.090
<i>I love you!</i>

09:58.215 --> 10:01.426
D'SOUZA: To be honest,
I didn't think Trump would win.

10:01.551 --> 10:05.472
Hillary had total control
of the Democratic machine,

10:05.597 --> 10:08.558
her foot on Sanders' throat,

10:08.683 --> 10:10.560
a sycophantic Hollywood
and media.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.689
How do you fight
against all that?

10:15.814 --> 10:19.401
ANNOUNCER: From NBC News,
"Decision Night in America."

10:19.526 --> 10:21.236
First and foremost,
it's finally here.

10:21.361 --> 10:22.529
Here at the Javits Center,

10:22.654 --> 10:25.323
which is Hillary Clinton's
election party site.

10:25.448 --> 10:27.325
There's a sense
of building excitement,

10:27.450 --> 10:29.243
and I mean building excitement.

10:29.369 --> 10:30.620
No, this is conservatives
waking up

10:30.745 --> 10:32.079
and smelling the coffee and go,

10:32.205 --> 10:33.748
"Oh, right, our candidate
was a moron."

10:33.873 --> 10:35.416
ANCHOR: And we have
our first projection

10:35.541 --> 10:37.835
that Donald Trump
will win in Kentucky.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.253
Okay, have Kentucky. Who cares?

10:39.378 --> 10:40.837
-It's small, it's small.
- CROWD: Donald Trump!

10:40.963 --> 10:42.422
- But he is winning.
- Donald Trump!

10:42.547 --> 10:45.091
Her lead beginning to go down
a little bit but still holding,

10:45.216 --> 10:46.593
so that's good news.

10:46.718 --> 10:48.970
WOLF BLITZER:
Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming.

10:49.095 --> 10:51.222
Trump, we project,
will win Texas.

10:51.347 --> 10:54.683
(over P.A.): ...Texas with all
of its 38 electoral votes.

10:58.187 --> 11:01.356
Anderson, this night is turning
out to be a real nail-biter.

11:01.481 --> 11:04.025
Donald Trump is leading
Hillary Clinton

11:04.150 --> 11:06.528
among white women in Ohio,

11:06.653 --> 11:08.947
North Carolina,
Georgia and Virginia.

11:09.072 --> 11:11.908
Does that surprise you?

11:12.033 --> 11:14.201
You should be nervous. This is
not kidding around anymore.

11:14.326 --> 11:16.787
BLITZER:
Louisiana, Montana, Missouri,

11:16.912 --> 11:18.997
- Ohio...
- Are you (bleep) me?

11:19.123 --> 11:20.666
Corning into the day,
you had your projection

11:20.791 --> 11:22.250
above 70% for Hillary Clinton.

11:22.375 --> 11:24.169
Where is it right now?

11:24.294 --> 11:25.420
But the crowd now
much more subdued here

11:25.545 --> 11:27.338
-this evening...
- BLITZER: Donald Trump

11:27.463 --> 11:29.257
will carry the state
of Florida.

11:32.093 --> 11:34.136
All right, we have another
major projection right now,

11:34.261 --> 11:36.847
that Donald Trump will carry
the state of North Carolina.

11:36.972 --> 11:38.265
Oh, wow.

11:38.390 --> 11:39.683
Can-can we go back to Michigan?

11:39.808 --> 11:40.851
'Cause I'm not sure
I saw it correctly.

11:40.976 --> 11:42.310
Was that a-a...

11:42.436 --> 11:43.520
Uh, Huffington Post,

11:43.645 --> 11:45.438
what happened
to your (bleep) 98.4%?

11:45.563 --> 11:46.898
CNN now projects
that Donald Trump

11:47.023 --> 11:49.233
will carry
the state of Wisconsin.

11:49.359 --> 11:51.527
He's cracked
the so-called blue wall.

11:51.652 --> 11:53.279
You pathetic losers!

11:53.404 --> 11:55.114
Winning Pennsylvania!

11:55.239 --> 11:57.199
Pennsylvania!

11:57.324 --> 11:59.201
Some big news here, Megan.
Huge news, actually.

11:59.326 --> 12:01.036
The AP now projecting
that Donald Trump

12:01.161 --> 12:02.621
has won the state
of Pennsylvania.

12:02.746 --> 12:04.789
Uh, Pennsylvania was called
for Donald Trump.

12:04.914 --> 12:06.541
It's over. Okay.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.042
BLITZER:
CNN projects,

12:08.167 --> 12:10.169
Donald Trump
wins the presidency.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.588
CROWD:
USA! USA! USA!

12:12.713 --> 12:14.924
D'SOUZA:
I was happy he won.

12:15.049 --> 12:16.884
My film, Hillary's America,

12:17.009 --> 12:19.678
an expose' of Hillary
and the Democratic Party,

12:19.803 --> 12:20.971
played a role.

12:21.096 --> 12:23.598
But Trump made it happen.

12:23.723 --> 12:25.433
And when he won,

12:25.558 --> 12:29.228
that fact did not sit well
with the left.

12:31.189 --> 12:32.857
You're awake, by the way.

12:32.940 --> 12:35.109
You're not having
a terrible, terrible dream.

12:35.192 --> 12:37.444
Also, you're not dead,
and you haven't gone to hell.

12:37.569 --> 12:39.863
This is your life now.
This is our election now.

12:39.988 --> 12:41.448
This is us.
This is our country.

12:41.573 --> 12:42.949
It's real.

12:43.074 --> 12:46.077
Everybody is crying
and so upset.

12:46.202 --> 12:48.496
Scared, depressed, despair.

12:48.621 --> 12:50.123
America is crying tonight.

12:50.248 --> 12:52.375
She deserves to be
the first female president,

12:52.500 --> 12:54.376
and that's what makes me
so sad.

12:54.502 --> 12:57.212
Sorry, I hate (bleep) crying
on camera, but...

12:57.338 --> 12:58.672
Get your abortions now.

12:58.797 --> 13:00.507
This sucks!

13:00.632 --> 13:03.426
People I'm speaking to think
it's absolutely catastrophic.

13:03.552 --> 13:06.846
ANCHOR: Boastful, bullying,
coarse, crude--

13:06.971 --> 13:09.098
that's the way they're
gonna see America, so...

13:09.223 --> 13:11.684
- ANCHOR 2: Ugly Americans,
right? -Ugly Americans.

13:11.809 --> 13:14.562
From slavery to,
you know, Nazism...

13:17.147 --> 13:20.192
We are not gonna be okay.

13:20.317 --> 13:21.485
Feels like the end
of the world.

13:21.610 --> 13:23.403
There are demonstrations
in major American cities

13:23.528 --> 13:25.488
across the country tonight over
the election of Donald Trump.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.242
D'SOUZA: Again,
the left turned to violence.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.410
MAN:
Yeah

13:31.536 --> 13:33.329
Yeah!

13:33.454 --> 13:34.622
ls there a doomsday plan?

13:34.747 --> 13:36.290
We're gonna...

13:36.415 --> 13:39.418
We're gonna go after him
in every conceivable way.

13:39.543 --> 13:41.586
ATrump presidency
is unthinkable and dangerous

13:41.712 --> 13:44.839
and damaging, so, basically,
anything we do to stop that

13:44.965 --> 13:46.800
is perfectly fine.
Whether it's ethical or not,

13:46.925 --> 13:48.926
whether it's legal or not,
it doesn't matter.

13:50.094 --> 13:51.596
D'SOUZA:
The political left

13:51.721 --> 13:54.432
immediately set out
to reverse the election results

13:54.557 --> 13:56.725
with a sequence of strategies.

13:56.850 --> 13:58.602
REPORTER: Today, Jill Stein
of the Green Party called

13:58.727 --> 14:01.980
for recounts in Wisconsin,
Michigan and Pennsylvania.

14:02.105 --> 14:05.275
D'SOUZA: That recount actually
increased Trump's lead.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.569
Thank you. Thank you, darling.

14:07.694 --> 14:09.195
D'SOUZA: There were
countless stories of Trump

14:09.320 --> 14:10.905
losing the popular vote.

14:11.030 --> 14:12.156
Donald Trump
won fair and square.

14:12.281 --> 14:13.616
How did he win fair and square?

14:13.741 --> 14:14.909
Hillary had more votes.

14:15.034 --> 14:16.619
D'SOUZA:
And they tried this.

14:16.744 --> 14:18.620
Republican members
of the electoral college,

14:18.745 --> 14:20.414
this message is for you.

14:20.539 --> 14:21.707
D'SOUZA:
Maybe they could convince

14:21.832 --> 14:23.542
Trump electors
not to vote for him.

14:23.667 --> 14:26.002
ANCHOR: I'm going to talk to
an electoral college voter next

14:26.127 --> 14:29.464
who says it's gone
as far as death threats.

14:29.589 --> 14:32.466
The votes are ten votes,
Donald J. Trump.

14:32.592 --> 14:34.927
- WOMAN: You sold out
our country!

14:35.052 --> 14:36.220
You sold out our country!

14:36.345 --> 14:37.930
Every one of you,
you're pathetic!

14:38.055 --> 14:40.349
- You don't deserve to be
in America! -Shame! Shame!

14:40.474 --> 14:42.809
Shame on you! Shame on you!

14:42.934 --> 14:44.644
D'SOUZA: Yes,
shame on the American people

14:44.769 --> 14:45.812
for voting for Trump.

14:45.937 --> 14:47.313
Shame on you.

14:47.438 --> 14:49.315
Tens of millions of Americans

14:49.440 --> 14:52.735
are totally fine with a man
who's driven almost purely

14:52.860 --> 14:55.571
by racism and sexism
and lslamophobia.

14:55.696 --> 14:56.989
I genuinely do not understand

14:57.114 --> 14:58.866
how America
can be this disorganized

14:58.991 --> 15:00.576
or this hateful.

15:00.701 --> 15:03.662
I have no respect for women
who voted for Trump. Okay?

15:03.787 --> 15:05.080
I just think you're dumb. Okay?

15:05.205 --> 15:06.998
I think you're (bleep) dumb.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.791
D'SOUZA: How do you think
people are going to vote

15:08.916 --> 15:10.460
if you talk to them that way?

15:10.585 --> 15:13.838
ANNOUNCER: The vice president
of the United States,

15:13.963 --> 15:15.798
Michael R. Pence.

15:15.923 --> 15:18.926
D'SOUZA:
More than 50 House Democrats

15:19.051 --> 15:21.678
boycotted the inauguration
of President Trump.

15:21.803 --> 15:23.889
Although the left
did show up...

15:24.014 --> 15:25.557
-to riot.
- WOMAN: What Antifa is.

15:25.682 --> 15:27.600
This is what
the anti-Trump movement is.

15:31.687 --> 15:34.065
It is total anarchy
in the streets right now.

15:34.190 --> 15:35.649
JOHN ROBERTS: ...preserve,
protect and defend...

15:35.774 --> 15:37.318
DONALD TRUMP: ...preserve,
protect and defend...

15:37.443 --> 15:40.070
ROBERTS: ...the Constitution
of the United States...

15:40.195 --> 15:42.489
...the Constitution
of the United States...

15:42.614 --> 15:44.783
-...so help me God.
-...so help me God.

15:44.908 --> 15:46.785
Congratulations, Mr. President.

15:46.910 --> 15:49.037
Yeah!

15:50.663 --> 15:55.334
No...!...!

15:55.459 --> 15:59.505
D'SOUZA: The left couldn't
keep him from being sworn in

15:59.630 --> 16:01.006
as president
of the United States,

16:01.131 --> 16:03.008
so they turned to impeachment.

16:03.133 --> 16:08.680
Next week, there will be
a vote to impeach.

16:08.805 --> 16:10.556
It's obviously a-a...
It's no small matter

16:10.681 --> 16:11.891
when we're talking
about impeaching

16:12.016 --> 16:13.100
the president
of the United States.

16:13.225 --> 16:15.519
You could write it down
in stone.

16:15.644 --> 16:18.105
He will not finish
his first term.

16:18.230 --> 16:22.109
The Democrats will take over,
and they can launch impeachment

16:22.234 --> 16:26.112
in 2019 without
a single Republican vote.

16:26.237 --> 16:28.698
Robert Mueller's Russia probe
will eventually reveal

16:28.823 --> 16:31.325
misdeeds
that are impeachment-worthy.

16:31.450 --> 16:35.579
Everyone is colluding
with Russia, except Trump.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.873
Here's Donald Trump. Donald.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.250
D'SOUZA: Maybe
the sexual harassment stuff

16:40.375 --> 16:42.669
would finally stick.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.754
But we knew
we weren't electing a choirboy.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.631
TUCKER CARLSON:
There's a new report alleging

16:46.756 --> 16:49.634
that Lisa Bloom solicited funds
to pay off women

16:49.759 --> 16:52.553
who would then accuse the
president of sexual assault.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.555
D'SOUZA:
How about the 25th Amendment?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.640
Because, you know,
Trump is crazy.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.308
ABBY HUNTSMAN: The amendment
says the president

16:58.434 --> 17:00.352
can be removed if majority
of the cabinet determines

17:00.477 --> 17:02.104
that he is unfit.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.356
This is a dangerously,
emotionally

17:04.481 --> 17:07.733
and-and mentally unstable
individual here.

17:09.944 --> 17:12.905
D'SOUZA: All this
may seem unprecedented,

17:13.030 --> 17:15.241
but we've been here before.

17:16.909 --> 17:21.913
In 1860, America elected
the first Republican president.

17:22.039 --> 17:24.915
Then, too, Democrats
viciously attacked him.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.711
They called him an extremist
and an authoritarian.

17:28.836 --> 17:31.172
Some sought
to break up the country

17:31.297 --> 17:33.507
rather than accept
his election.

17:33.632 --> 17:36.719
Lincoln saved America
for the first time.

17:36.844 --> 17:39.763
And now, by tragic necessity,

17:39.888 --> 17:42.516
Trump is in
a similar situation.

17:42.641 --> 17:45.852
What will the Democrats try
this time?

17:48.021 --> 17:49.856
Look at this Hitler speech.
And we've translated it

17:49.981 --> 17:50.857
for you.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.608
"Thank you. Thank you.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.693
We're going to make Germany
great again."

17:54.819 --> 17:58.280
90% of what he says,
I'm like, "This guy gets it."

17:58.405 --> 18:01.742
He's going to take our economy
from here to here.

18:01.867 --> 18:03.743
Yeah, he's definitely taking it
to a higher level.

18:03.869 --> 18:06.413
I'd say his support is about,
uh... about up there.

18:06.538 --> 18:08.873
Right around here.

18:08.998 --> 18:12.418
Donald Trump is flirting
with fascism, American-style.

18:12.543 --> 18:15.754
There's a word for this,
Ashley. It's "fascism."

18:15.880 --> 18:17.631
D'SOUZA: And they don't
just call him a fascist.

18:17.756 --> 18:20.217
Do you think
President Trump is a racist?

18:20.342 --> 18:22.052
I think he is a racist.

18:22.177 --> 18:25.847
This was a white-lash
against a changing country.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.849
The president
is "a white supremacist"

18:27.974 --> 18:30.435
and that his rise is "a direct
result of white supremacy."

18:30.560 --> 18:34.647
D'SOUZA: There it is,
racism and fascism.

18:34.772 --> 18:36.148
And we've heard it before.

18:36.273 --> 18:38.150
These incendiary accusations

18:38.275 --> 18:42.070
have been used for a generation
to shame and smear

18:42.195 --> 18:43.989
Republicans, conservatives,

18:44.114 --> 18:46.324
Christians and patriots.

18:46.449 --> 18:49.494
Is voting for Trump
like voting for Hitler?

18:49.619 --> 18:52.872
Did Trump win because
of fascism and white supremacy?

18:52.997 --> 18:58.001
Did he revive the worst strains
of America 's history of racism?

18:58.127 --> 19:00.212
Wouldn't that justify the left

19:00.337 --> 19:02.631
in rejecting the results
of the election?

19:04.591 --> 19:07.594
But if they're wrong,
if America is good,

19:07.719 --> 19:10.263
aren't we morally obligated
to defend her?

19:10.388 --> 19:12.515
The stakes could not be higher.

19:12.640 --> 19:16.602
We're talking about the fate of
the greatest nation on Earth.

19:16.727 --> 19:19.438
Who are the real fascists?

19:19.563 --> 19:22.566
Who are the real racists?

19:22.691 --> 19:25.318
We must learn the truth.

19:25.443 --> 19:27.570
For progressives today,

19:27.695 --> 19:29.364
fascism is on the right,

19:29.489 --> 19:33.034
a philosophy of nationalism
and authoritarianism.

19:33.159 --> 19:36.870
They call Trump a fascist
because he's a nationalist.

19:36.996 --> 19:39.039
But so was
my countryman, Gandhi.

19:39.164 --> 19:41.875
So was Mandela
and Winston Churchill.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.085
Lincoln was a nationalist.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.920
Were these men fascists?

19:46.046 --> 19:48.756
We've had authoritarian leaders
since the beginning of time,

19:48.881 --> 19:50.758
but few were fascists.

19:50.883 --> 19:53.886
Look, Trump gets flayed
in the media every day.

19:54.011 --> 19:57.473
Real authoritarians
would have shut that down.

19:57.598 --> 19:59.975
So authoritarianism
and nationalism

20:00.100 --> 20:02.811
don't exhaust the meaning
of fascism.

20:02.936 --> 20:05.730
To go deeper, I sat down
with progressive historian

20:05.855 --> 20:07.857
Robert Paxton,

20:07.982 --> 20:09.567
former head
of Columbia University's

20:09.692 --> 20:11.736
history department.

20:11.861 --> 20:15.614
Paxton is no fan
of Donald Trump.

20:15.739 --> 20:18.617
We have a group
in America today, Antifa...

20:20.827 --> 20:22.120
...which fashions itself

20:22.245 --> 20:23.371
anti-fascist.

20:23.497 --> 20:25.749
- Yes. -It drive speakers
off the campus.

20:25.874 --> 20:29.127
Outwardly, it seems like
there is some resemblance

20:29.252 --> 20:30.253
to Mussolini's Blackshirts.

20:30.378 --> 20:33.047
And the mission
appears the same.

20:33.172 --> 20:36.717
In other words, to enforce a
kind of ideological conformity

20:36.842 --> 20:39.261
by roughing up your opposition.

20:39.386 --> 20:41.847
Do you see a parallel
between Antifa

20:41.972 --> 20:44.683
and the fascists that they
claim to be fighting?

20:44.808 --> 20:47.227
I think there's
some tactical overlap.

20:47.352 --> 20:48.770
As soon as you start, uh,

20:48.895 --> 20:50.897
wearing a uniform
and beating people up,

20:51.022 --> 20:52.940
you're obviously
in fascist territory.

20:53.065 --> 20:55.151
Now, does fascism matter today?

20:55.276 --> 20:57.152
- Yes.
- Some people have said

20:57.277 --> 20:59.154
we are living through
a fascist moment,

20:59.279 --> 21:01.656
or a fascist strain,
in American politics.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.492
Are you worried
that that's true?

21:03.617 --> 21:06.911
The fascist label
seems to me to overlook

21:07.036 --> 21:08.663
two very important differences.

21:08.788 --> 21:10.415
One is that fascist regimes

21:10.540 --> 21:12.208
did not want a free economy.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.959
They had a regulated economy,

21:14.085 --> 21:16.670
and they had
what was called corporatism,

21:16.795 --> 21:19.882
uh, the... and all
the business enterprises

21:20.007 --> 21:23.635
were required to participate
in five-year plans,

21:23.760 --> 21:27.931
and that is the opposite
of what's going on.

21:28.056 --> 21:30.683
So the principles
of the American founding--

21:30.808 --> 21:32.893
the separation
of state and society,

21:33.019 --> 21:34.728
- Mm-hmm.
- limited government,

21:34.854 --> 21:36.522
- Yes.
- Individual rights,

21:36.647 --> 21:40.317
property rights, free markets--

21:40.442 --> 21:43.028
would you agree that this is
what the fascists hated?

21:43.153 --> 21:45.030
The fascists,
and a lot of other people,

21:45.155 --> 21:47.157
believed that these things
had failed,

21:47.282 --> 21:49.617
and they were... they, uh,
were determined to propose

21:49.742 --> 21:52.370
an alternative that
would revive their country.

21:52.495 --> 21:53.788
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Dateline Rome.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.165
October 31, 1922.

21:56.290 --> 21:58.459
<i>Italy was</i> a <i>sitting duck
for an ex-Communist</i>

21:58.584 --> 22:00.210
named Benito Mussolini.

22:00.335 --> 22:01.962
The lantern-jawed
founder of fascism

22:02.087 --> 22:04.422
took advantage of
the political unrest in Italy

22:04.547 --> 22:05.840
after World War I.

22:05.965 --> 22:07.884
Mussolini directed
a march on Rome.

22:12.346 --> 22:14.640
The next step was
complete dictatorial control,

22:14.765 --> 22:16.642
a step which the Italian
Blackshirt leader

22:16.767 --> 22:18.811
took without a second thought.

22:18.936 --> 22:20.979
D'SOUZA:
When Mussolini started out,

22:21.104 --> 22:22.230
he was a Marxist.

22:22.355 --> 22:24.024
- He was a socialist.
- Yes.

22:24.149 --> 22:25.692
He was the editor
of the socialist newspaper.

22:25.817 --> 22:27.360
- Yes.
- He had a long background

22:27.485 --> 22:28.486
in socialist politics, right?

22:28.611 --> 22:29.529
Right, right. Exactly.

22:29.654 --> 22:30.696
Mussolini allied himself

22:30.822 --> 22:32.156
with an intellectual,

22:32.281 --> 22:33.657
- Giovanni Gentile.
- Yes.

22:33.783 --> 22:35.576
D'SOUZA:
Gentile famously said,

22:35.701 --> 22:38.245
"Everything in the state,
and nothing outside the state."

22:38.370 --> 22:40.706
- Yes. -Which Mussolini
himself later repeated.

22:40.831 --> 22:43.250
How would you interpret
this doctrine

22:43.375 --> 22:46.461
of sort of
centralized state power?

22:46.586 --> 22:50.048
Mussolini, uh, and the people
who rallied to his cause--

22:50.173 --> 22:52.466
and this included
some highly educated people

22:52.592 --> 22:53.926
like Giovanni Gentile--

22:54.051 --> 22:55.719
they were absolutely determined

22:55.844 --> 22:58.514
to make Italy strong,
and it would come about

22:58.639 --> 23:00.390
by a central authority

23:00.515 --> 23:03.185
and direction,
and I think that the state,

23:03.310 --> 23:06.229
uh, was the instrument
by which they thought

23:06.354 --> 23:08.898
that, uh, Italy
would be regenerated.

23:09.023 --> 23:11.150
And loyalty to the state
is the vehicle

23:11.275 --> 23:13.944
-to mobilize that inner soul,
right? -Yes.

23:21.702 --> 23:23.578
D'SOUZA:
Mussolini was responding

23:23.703 --> 23:26.790
to what historians called
the Crisis of Marxism.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.043
Marx predicted
that worker revolts would erupt

23:31.169 --> 23:34.171
in every
industrialized country.

23:34.296 --> 23:36.882
But this never took place.

23:37.007 --> 23:39.384
Marx thought workers
around the world

23:39.510 --> 23:41.511
would identify with each other

23:41.636 --> 23:43.597
on the basis of class.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.682
He rejected nationalism,

23:45.807 --> 23:48.434
saying a working man
has no country.

23:50.103 --> 23:53.189
But Gentile,
though himself a socialist,

23:53.314 --> 23:55.608
noticed that during World War I

23:55.733 --> 23:58.402
working men fought
for their own country.

23:58.527 --> 24:00.737
Mussolini and Gentile concluded

24:00.862 --> 24:03.865
that a new type
of socialism was needed

24:03.990 --> 24:08.244
that would fuse nationalism
and socialism.

24:08.369 --> 24:10.746
They called it "fascism."

24:10.872 --> 24:15.084
<i>And this is why socialists
and progressives in America,</i>

24:15.209 --> 24:17.795
many of whom had given up
on orthodox Marxism,

24:17.920 --> 24:19.546
were drawn to fascism.

24:19.671 --> 24:20.922
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT:
In the working out

24:21.048 --> 24:23.758
of a great national program

24:23.884 --> 24:26.344
that seeks the primary good
of the greater number...

24:26.469 --> 24:28.346
D'SOUZA:
Our new president at the time,

24:28.471 --> 24:31.224
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
was infatuated

24:31.349 --> 24:33.517
by Mussolini.

24:33.642 --> 24:37.980
He called him "that admirable
Italian gentleman."

24:38.105 --> 24:41.274
"I am much interested
and deeply impressed

24:41.400 --> 24:44.236
"by what he has accomplished
and by his evidenced

24:44.361 --> 24:48.114
honest purpose
in restoring Italy."

24:48.239 --> 24:51.450
Mussolini reviewed FDR's book
in an Italian magazine.

24:51.576 --> 24:54.870
His conclusion:
"FDR is one of us.

24:54.995 --> 24:57.039
He's a fascist."

24:57.164 --> 25:00.626
FDR dispatched members
of his brain trust to Rome

25:00.751 --> 25:02.043
to study Italian fascism

25:02.169 --> 25:05.463
with a view to importing
some of it here.

25:05.588 --> 25:08.299
Rexford Tugwell,
one of FDR's closest advisors,

25:08.424 --> 25:11.511
after returning from Italy,
observed:

25:11.636 --> 25:13.763
<i>"Fascism is the cleanest,
neatest,</i>

25:13.888 --> 25:16.724
<i>"most efficient piece
of social machinery</i>

25:16.849 --> 25:19.226
"I've ever seen.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.894
It makes me envious."

25:21.019 --> 25:24.689
The head of FDR's NRA,
or National Recovery Act,

25:24.814 --> 25:27.108
Hugh Johnson, spoke of

25:27.233 --> 25:30.736
the "shining example
of Mussolini, "

25:30.862 --> 25:33.948
he carried fascist literature
in his pocket, and he called

25:34.073 --> 25:37.201
for the end of free-market
capitalism in America.

25:37.326 --> 25:40.579
He empowered industrial
committees in every industry

25:40.704 --> 25:42.873
to set wages and prices

25:42.998 --> 25:44.749
and report
to the federal government.

25:44.874 --> 25:49.670
Clearly, FDR recognized
fascism was on the left.

25:49.796 --> 25:53.174
He saw it as more progressive
than the New Deal.

25:53.299 --> 25:55.801
Mussolini was clearly
a man of the left.

25:55.926 --> 25:59.012
But what about the ultimate
fascist of them all,

25:59.138 --> 26:00.347
Adolf Hitler?

26:00.472 --> 26:02.766
Was he a man of the left?

26:02.891 --> 26:05.852
To figure this out,
we must go to Europe.

26:21.283 --> 26:23.535
Hitler, like Mussolini,
was a veteran

26:23.660 --> 26:25.578
of World War I.

26:26.955 --> 26:28.623
His politics were formed

26:28.748 --> 26:31.250
here in Schwabing,
in the atmosphere

26:31.375 --> 26:34.003
of bohemianism
and sectarian socialism.

26:36.463 --> 26:39.633
The Communist Lenin
lived here in exile.

26:39.758 --> 26:42.427
Hitler and Lenin
both frequented the same pub.

26:42.552 --> 26:45.722
Lenin famously
didn't pay his bar tab.

26:45.847 --> 26:48.808
Imagine Lenin sitting here
arguing with friends

26:48.933 --> 26:51.435
on how to save Communism.

26:51.561 --> 26:54.522
Lenin lived
just a block up the street.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.274
Hitler lived a block over.

26:57.399 --> 27:00.694
Hitler changed the name
of the German Workers' Party

27:00.819 --> 27:04.572
to the National Socialist
German Workers' Party.

27:04.698 --> 27:08.409
The very term "Nazi"
is a compression of two words:

27:08.534 --> 27:12.121
"national " and "sozialista. "

27:12.246 --> 27:15.666
Check out the official
Nazi platform:

27:15.791 --> 27:18.335
State-controlled health care.

27:18.460 --> 27:21.713
Profit sharing for workers
in large corporations.

27:21.838 --> 27:25.216
Money lenders and profiteers
punished by death.

27:25.342 --> 27:27.385
State control of education.

27:27.510 --> 27:29.971
State control
of media and the press.

27:30.096 --> 27:32.473
State control of banks
and industries.

27:32.598 --> 27:34.975
Seizure of land
without compensation.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.353
State control
of religious expression.

27:37.478 --> 27:39.771
This reads like something
jointly written

27:39.897 --> 27:42.357
by Elizabeth Warren
and Bernie Sanders.

27:42.482 --> 27:43.817
Read the Nazi platform

27:43.942 --> 27:45.902
at the Democratic
National Convention,

27:46.027 --> 27:49.155
and most likely it would
provoke thunderous applause.

27:49.280 --> 27:53.034
Like Mussolini and Lenin,
Hitler was anti-big business,

27:53.159 --> 27:56.036
anti-bourgeois
and anti-capitalist.

27:56.161 --> 28:00.624
But unlike Mussolini and Lenin,
Hitler was also a racist.

28:00.749 --> 28:03.919
His racism, too,
was rooted in his hatred

28:04.044 --> 28:06.296
of capitalism and business.

28:06.421 --> 28:08.798
He called the Jews
"greedy bankers."

28:08.923 --> 28:11.801
Hitler set out
to destroy the Jews,

28:11.926 --> 28:14.970
confiscate their wealth
and redistribute it

28:15.095 --> 28:19.558
through Nazi socialist
and welfare state programs.

28:23.353 --> 28:27.315
Another group Hitler hated
were the Communists.

28:30.068 --> 28:31.944
Not because
they were socialists,

28:32.069 --> 28:35.531
but because they took
their orders from Moscow.

28:35.656 --> 28:39.993
His thuggery started right here
at Schellingstrasse 50,

28:40.118 --> 28:42.579
Hitler's Nazi headquarters.

29:00.887 --> 29:04.766
Hitler saw the Communists
as traitors to Germany.

29:18.112 --> 29:20.364
He was a National Socialist,

29:20.489 --> 29:23.033
and they were
International Socialists.

29:26.995 --> 29:29.038
He patterned his Brownshirts

29:29.163 --> 29:32.041
both on Mussolini's Blackshirts
and on the Ku Klux Klan.

29:38.213 --> 29:40.215
The Nazi Brownshirts
and the Klan

29:40.340 --> 29:44.177
were both about the same size--
two to three million members.

29:44.302 --> 29:47.764
Both groups targeted
a vulnerable minority."

29:47.889 --> 29:50.058
in the case
of the Brownshirts, Jews;

29:50.183 --> 29:53.144
in the case of the KKK, blacks.

30:00.025 --> 30:03.653
And both groups were extensions
of a political party:

30:03.778 --> 30:07.574
in the case of the Brownshirts,
the Nazi Party;

30:07.699 --> 30:11.577
in the case of the Klan,
the Democratic Party.

30:19.001 --> 30:22.671
In November of 1923,
Hitler and his Brownshirts

30:22.796 --> 30:24.881
took over
the Burger Brau Keller,

30:25.006 --> 30:28.092
a popular Munich beer hall.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.264
D'SOUZA:
The following day, Hitler

32:04.389 --> 32:06.641
and 2,000 party members
marched on Munich

32:06.766 --> 32:08.059
to seize control.

32:08.184 --> 32:09.894
They were met by police.

32:10.019 --> 32:13.689
Hitler was arrested
and sent to Landsberg Prison,

32:13.814 --> 32:16.984
a formative period in his life.

32:18.318 --> 32:20.862
Here, Hitler dictated
Mein Kampf

32:20.988 --> 32:23.740
to his fellow prisoner,
Rudolf Hess.

32:47.262 --> 32:49.055
See how remote all of this is

32:49.180 --> 32:50.765
from the principles
of Abraham Lincoln

32:50.890 --> 32:53.017
and the American founding?

32:53.142 --> 32:55.728
Hitler, however,
had a much greater affinity

32:55.853 --> 32:59.189
for progressives and Democrats.

33:14.745 --> 33:16.288
It was here

33:16.413 --> 33:19.499
Hitler got a big idea
from the Democratic Party,

33:19.625 --> 33:22.419
one that would shape
his murderous campaigns.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.339
According to Pulitzer
Prize-winning biographer

33:26.464 --> 33:30.343
John Toland, Hitler often
praised the extermination

33:30.468 --> 33:34.680
of the "red savages" who could
not be tamed by captivity.

33:34.805 --> 33:38.517
Hitler admired
how Jacksonian Democrats

33:38.642 --> 33:41.103
"gunned down
the millions of redskins

33:41.228 --> 33:43.396
"to a few hundred thousand,

33:43.522 --> 33:46.774
"and now keep the modest
remnant under observation

33:46.900 --> 33:48.860
in a cage."

33:50.528 --> 33:53.572
His idea was to do
to the Poles, the Slavs,

33:53.698 --> 33:55.950
the Eastern Europeans
and the Russians

33:56.075 --> 34:01.621
precisely what the Jacksonian
Democrats did to the Indians.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.587
Hitler came to power in 1933.

34:11.172 --> 34:13.049
Heil Hitler!

34:13.174 --> 34:15.176
On the other side
of the Atlantic,

34:15.301 --> 34:17.678
another charismatic leader,

34:17.803 --> 34:20.138
FDR, was elected.

34:20.264 --> 34:23.058
The two men
recognized each other

34:23.183 --> 34:26.018
as fellow progressives.

34:26.143 --> 34:29.355
Here's what the Nazi newspaper,
Volkischer Beobachter,

34:29.480 --> 34:32.650
said of the FDR administration."

34:32.775 --> 34:35.277
"We, too,
as German National Socialists,

34:35.402 --> 34:38.822
are looking toward America."

34:38.947 --> 34:41.533
The Nazi paper
congratulated FDR

34:41.658 --> 34:46.079
for replacing the uninhibited
frenzy of market speculation

34:46.204 --> 34:48.706
with the adoption
of National Socialist

34:48.831 --> 34:50.833
strains of thought.

34:50.958 --> 34:54.170
Of FDR's New Deal,
the Volkischer Beobachter said:

34:54.295 --> 34:58.549
"We fear only the possibility
that it might fail. "

35:02.135 --> 35:06.055
Hitler quickly consolidated
his power.

35:06.181 --> 35:08.975
He executed leaders
of the Brownshirts

35:09.100 --> 35:10.977
who had challenged
his authority.

35:11.102 --> 35:13.729
This was the famous
Night of the Long Knives.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.193
Some progressives
try to portray Hitler

35:20.319 --> 35:23.613
as a right-winger
by insisting he was anti-gay.

35:27.367 --> 35:30.536
But Hitler knew that the
Brownshirt leader, Ernst Rohm,

35:30.661 --> 35:35.207
was a notorious homosexual,
as were many other Brownshirts.

35:36.917 --> 35:40.170
When Hitler showed up
to arrest Rohm...

35:40.295 --> 35:42.881
he encountered
a remarkable scene.

35:44.299 --> 35:46.634
Heil, mein Fuhrer!

35:53.724 --> 35:56.518
Rohm publicly suggested
that he, not Hitler,

35:56.644 --> 35:59.313
was the true leader
of the Nazi Party.

36:09.364 --> 36:11.782
When Heinrich Himmler
urged Hitler

36:11.908 --> 36:16.578
to purge the gay Brownshirts
out of the Nazi movement,

36:16.704 --> 36:18.413
Hitler refused.

36:18.539 --> 36:22.834
Hitler said he didn't care what
the Brownshirts did in private,

36:22.959 --> 36:24.961
as long as they were
good fighters.

36:28.047 --> 36:31.717
Hitler was no
social conservative.

36:31.842 --> 36:34.678
Earlier, we saw what Hitler
learned from the Democrats.

36:34.804 --> 36:35.971
But was there anything

36:36.096 --> 36:38.599
he learned from
American progressives?

36:38.724 --> 36:41.893
Investigative journalist
Edwin Black,

36:42.018 --> 36:45.313
the son of Holocaust survivors,
is the author

36:45.438 --> 36:47.774
of The War Against the Weak.

36:47.899 --> 36:50.401
Now, you have written
that eugenics in America--

36:50.526 --> 36:53.529
and this is true in other parts
of Europe as well--

36:53.654 --> 36:56.782
was a progressive CEIUSG.

36:56.907 --> 36:59.243
Progressive in what sense?

36:59.368 --> 37:01.078
Progressive in every sense.

37:01.203 --> 37:02.621
This was not done by people

37:02.746 --> 37:04.581
who thought that
they were race haters.

37:04.706 --> 37:06.499
This was done
by the do-gooders,

37:06.624 --> 37:10.211
the liberals, the people
who wanted to improve society.

37:10.336 --> 37:15.299
Margaret Sanger, a progressive
who wanted to help humanity.

37:15.424 --> 37:17.468
And her approach to doing that

37:17.593 --> 37:20.762
was to wipe away the existence
of two-thirds of all people.

37:20.887 --> 37:23.473
You mean two-thirds of
the entire American population?

37:23.598 --> 37:25.392
- Yes, of course.
- And she actually

37:25.517 --> 37:27.310
- explicitly said this?
- Of course.

37:27.435 --> 37:29.645
She wanted to get rid
of "human weeds."

37:29.771 --> 37:31.939
She wrote about this
extensively.

37:32.064 --> 37:33.899
<i>At one point,
Hitler wrote fan mail</i>

37:34.024 --> 37:36.277
to one of her colleagues
on her board

37:36.402 --> 37:39.279
and said, uh,
"Your writings are my bible."

37:39.404 --> 37:40.697
Uh, this is Madison Grant,

37:40.822 --> 37:43.325
the head of the New York
Zoological Society.

37:43.450 --> 37:46.161
Tell me about the meeting
between Madison Grant

37:46.286 --> 37:48.746
and Whitney,
another prominent eugenicist.

37:48.871 --> 37:53.459
Madison Grant is discussing
his fan mail from Adolf Hitler,

37:53.584 --> 37:56.962
and Whitney has an identical
letter just like it.

37:57.087 --> 38:01.383
And so they both have letters
in which Hitler thanks them.

38:01.508 --> 38:03.385
All these eugenicists saying,

38:03.510 --> 38:08.306
"We have had a dramatic impact
on Germany."

38:08.431 --> 38:10.600
And you quote an American
progressive eugenicist

38:10.725 --> 38:13.310
basically saying, "Hey, whoa,
we've got to pick it up.

38:13.436 --> 38:14.937
"The Nazis are beating us

38:15.062 --> 38:17.189
- at our own game."
- That's right.

38:17.314 --> 38:19.274
While we were
pussyfooting around,

38:19.399 --> 38:22.527
the Nazis were beating us
at our own game.

38:22.652 --> 38:23.987
Why is it the case today,

38:24.112 --> 38:26.865
if I open
a Planned Parenthood brochure,

38:26.990 --> 38:30.660
I get a completely different
picture of Margaret Sanger

38:30.785 --> 38:32.536
than anything
that you've described?

38:32.662 --> 38:34.705
What's going on
is the reshaping

38:34.830 --> 38:36.624
and the falsifying of history.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.126
The Nazis
also invented history.

38:39.251 --> 38:40.919
There's a role
for people like me

38:41.044 --> 38:42.712
and a role for people like you.

38:42.838 --> 38:47.050
We spend our lives trying to
authenticate the real history.

38:48.384 --> 38:49.635
D'SOUZA:
We've learned how Hitler

38:49.761 --> 38:51.888
got his murderous
conquest scheme

38:52.013 --> 38:53.597
from the Jacksonian Democrats.

38:53.723 --> 38:56.767
We've also learned
how he got eugenics schemes

38:56.892 --> 38:58.435
from left-wing progressives.

39:00.103 --> 39:04.733
But what does Nazi racism owe
to the Democratic Party?

39:04.858 --> 39:08.653
I went to see the historian
and sociologist Stefan Kuhl,

39:08.778 --> 39:11.155
who has developed
an international reputation

39:11.280 --> 39:14.033
for books like
The Nazi Connection.

39:14.158 --> 39:16.327
I met with him in Munich.

39:17.828 --> 39:20.080
What was the essence
of the Nuremberg Laws?

39:20.205 --> 39:21.373
These are the laws of 1935.

39:21.498 --> 39:24.793
What did they seek to do?

39:24.918 --> 39:27.670
KUHL: They actually gave,
uh, the first definition

39:27.795 --> 39:29.714
of what is a Jew.

39:29.839 --> 39:31.757
It was not very easy
for the Nazis

39:31.882 --> 39:33.384
to define what is a Jew.

40:10.001 --> 40:12.420
Amerika?

41:34.662 --> 41:37.247
D'SOUZA:
The Nazi Nuremberg Laws

41:37.373 --> 41:40.250
were directly modeled
on the segregation laws

41:40.375 --> 41:42.794
of the Democratic Party.

41:42.919 --> 41:45.755
Every segregation law
in the American South

41:45.880 --> 41:48.758
was passed
by a Democratic legislature,

41:48.883 --> 41:50.802
signed by
a Democratic governor

41:50.927 --> 41:54.388
and enforced
by Democratic officials.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.932
As for the Democratic
one-drop rule,

41:57.057 --> 42:01.436
incredibly, the Nazis found it
too racist even for them.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.732
As is well known,

42:05.857 --> 42:08.901
the Nazis also hated
freedom of speech.

42:09.027 --> 42:12.029
The Nazi concept was called
Gleichschaltung,

42:12.154 --> 42:16.241
which means bringing all the
cultural institutions in line

42:16.367 --> 42:18.035
with Nazi ideology.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.037
This was the significance

42:20.162 --> 42:22.497
of the "Heil Hitler" salute

42:22.622 --> 42:26.668
and the draping of
swastika flags off balconies.

42:26.793 --> 42:29.629
These things signaled
humble conformity

42:29.754 --> 42:32.423
to Nazi doctrine.

42:39.513 --> 42:42.015
And what happened
to dissident views

42:42.140 --> 42:44.184
on the German campus?

43:17.006 --> 43:19.132
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

43:20.509 --> 43:22.469
D'SOUZA:
Movements to crush dissent

43:22.594 --> 43:26.097
can quickly escalate
from episodic violence

43:26.222 --> 43:27.932
to mass murder.

43:28.057 --> 43:30.268
Hitler's
Night of the Broken Glass

43:30.393 --> 43:34.313
was justified as a lawful
confiscation of firearms.

43:35.940 --> 43:38.942
This made Jews defenseless
against Nazi assault.

43:39.067 --> 43:43.863
Then Hitler could carry out his
goal to burn Jewish businesses,

43:43.989 --> 43:45.657
destroy synagogues

43:45.782 --> 43:48.451
and eliminate Jews
as a competitive threat

43:48.576 --> 43:50.536
in the German economy.

43:51.954 --> 43:54.248
Hitler didn't
just target synagogues.

43:54.373 --> 43:56.458
He also targeted
Christian churches.

43:56.583 --> 43:58.460
Many people don't know this,

43:58.585 --> 44:00.837
because they've bought
the progressive line

44:00.962 --> 44:03.215
that Hitler was a Christian.

44:03.340 --> 44:05.425
When coming to power,
Hitler knew he needed

44:05.550 --> 44:07.010
Christian support,

44:07.135 --> 44:10.263
and so he feigned
public belief in Christianity.

44:10.388 --> 44:13.182
But privately,
in a series of recordings,

44:13.307 --> 44:15.726
Hitler railed
against Christianity

44:15.851 --> 44:19.897
as a destructive institution
contrary to science

44:20.022 --> 44:23.942
and the natural law
of survival of the fittest.

44:25.860 --> 44:28.738
Once in office,
Hitler persecuted Christians.

44:28.863 --> 44:30.948
His ultimate aim:
the total destruction

44:31.073 --> 44:33.701
of Christianity in Germany.

44:36.412 --> 44:39.748
As a progressive, Hitler
despised religious liberty.

44:39.873 --> 44:42.292
Nazism was his religion.

44:47.130 --> 44:49.716
With Germany the high altar

44:49.841 --> 44:53.094
and Hitler himself
the new messiah.

44:54.178 --> 44:56.680
Hitler was no Christian.

44:58.891 --> 45:02.561
American progressives cheered
Hitler's rise to power.

45:05.688 --> 45:07.482
They saw fascism,

45:07.607 --> 45:10.359
with its social control
and its glorification

45:10.485 --> 45:12.069
of the centralized state,

45:12.194 --> 45:14.905
as a model for the future.

45:22.454 --> 45:25.373
With total control
of the people in place,

45:25.498 --> 45:28.167
Hitler could now implement
his master plan.

45:35.925 --> 45:39.094
In 1939, he invaded Poland.

45:39.219 --> 45:41.805
Within two years,
he and Mussolini controlled

45:41.930 --> 45:43.223
continental Europe.

45:43.348 --> 45:45.016
Japan was at war with China.

45:45.141 --> 45:48.645
Fascism was on the march
across the world.

45:48.770 --> 45:52.356
Soon Hitler would declare war
against America.

45:56.694 --> 45:58.821
Once Hitler acquired
war captives,

45:58.946 --> 46:03.658
he saw a way to implement
his own slave plantation,

46:03.783 --> 46:06.286
which he called
the "concentration camp."

46:07.954 --> 46:10.873
Concentration camps,
which were forced-labor camps,

46:10.998 --> 46:14.919
should be distinguished from
death camps, whose sole purpose

46:15.044 --> 46:17.212
was extermination.

46:18.714 --> 46:21.967
What was the origin
of these death camps?

46:22.092 --> 46:24.844
NARRATOR: His Minister
of Interior directed a program

46:24.969 --> 46:29.015
aimed at aged, insane
or incurable Germans,

46:29.140 --> 46:32.059
the so-called "useless eaters."

46:32.184 --> 46:34.854
Thousands were committed
to special institutions.

46:34.979 --> 46:37.815
Few ever returned.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.816
Evidence proves
they were murdered

46:39.942 --> 46:41.401
because they were useless
to the plans

46:41.526 --> 46:43.361
of the Nazi conspirators.

46:44.863 --> 46:47.907
Let's turn
to the Nazi euthanasia laws.

46:48.032 --> 46:50.118
First of all, would it
be accurate to say that

46:50.243 --> 46:51.619
we aren't talking
about real euthanasia?

46:51.744 --> 46:53.788
Without consent,
neither of the parents

46:53.913 --> 46:55.873
nor of the handicapped
himself, yeah.

46:55.998 --> 46:58.125
So euthanasia was
a pure euphemism, just...

46:58.250 --> 47:01.169
Yes. It was killing.
It was killing program.

47:01.294 --> 47:05.090
They started the killing
of mentally handicapped before

47:05.215 --> 47:06.966
on a very low-scale level,

47:07.091 --> 47:08.968
but, uh, started systematically

47:09.093 --> 47:10.970
with the killing
of mentally handicapped

47:11.095 --> 47:13.180
after the beginning
of the Second World War.

47:13.305 --> 47:16.225
And isn't it... isn't it true
to say that the...

47:16.350 --> 47:17.935
some of the personnel

47:18.060 --> 47:20.771
who administered
the euthanasia camps

47:20.896 --> 47:23.940
were also then later deployed

47:24.065 --> 47:25.734
to the so-called death camps

47:25.859 --> 47:28.945
that were used on a much larger
industrial scale?

47:29.070 --> 47:30.738
That's very clear.
We have technolog...

47:30.863 --> 47:32.782
technology transfer
and the personal transfer

47:32.907 --> 47:34.783
from the killing
of mentally handicapped

47:34.909 --> 47:36.201
to the killing of Jews.

47:36.327 --> 47:39.663
And especially
the whole staff operating

47:39.788 --> 47:41.498
the gas chambers, for example.

47:41.623 --> 47:44.250
D'SOUZA: Let me ask you
about Josef Mengele,

47:44.376 --> 47:47.545
the notorious Nazi doctor
at Auschwitz.

47:51.882 --> 47:55.302
When you read about him,
he saw himself as...

47:55.427 --> 47:56.887
as a progressive--

47:57.012 --> 47:59.723
somebody advancing
not only the cause of science,

47:59.848 --> 48:02.767
but the future benefit
to humanity.

48:02.893 --> 48:04.519
KUHL:
Progressive idea was

48:04.644 --> 48:07.313
very strongly part
of the Nazi ideology.

48:07.438 --> 48:09.941
<i>D'SOUZA: Would it surprise you
if I were to tell you</i>

48:10.066 --> 48:13.527
that after the war Mengele
went down to South America,

48:13.652 --> 48:16.363
where he actually had
a sort of career

48:16.488 --> 48:18.574
<i>as an abortionist?</i>

48:18.699 --> 48:19.866
No...!, not at all.

48:21.243 --> 48:23.370
D'SOUZA:
In classic progressive fashion,

48:23.495 --> 48:26.080
Mengele made an easy transition

48:26.206 --> 48:29.792
from one form of killing
to another.

48:36.632 --> 48:38.675
Once American and Allied troops

48:38.800 --> 48:41.762
liberated
the concentration camps...

48:44.931 --> 48:49.060
...once the world saw
these ghostly, emaciated,

48:49.185 --> 48:52.647
starving figures emerge
from those camps,

48:52.772 --> 48:57.067
Nazism, fascism and theories
of racial superiority

48:57.192 --> 49:00.529
were permanently discredited.

49:09.078 --> 49:11.038
Immediately following the war,

49:11.163 --> 49:14.917
in the Nuremberg trials
held here in room 600,

49:15.042 --> 49:18.128
the full horror
of fascist and Nazi atrocities

49:18.253 --> 49:20.172
was put before the world.

49:20.297 --> 49:21.840
<i>MAN:
United States of America</i>

49:21.965 --> 49:23.842
present count one
of the indictment,

49:23.967 --> 49:25.844
that all the defendants
participated

49:25.969 --> 49:29.847
as organizers or accomplices
in a common plan

49:29.972 --> 49:33.350
or conspiracy
to commit crimes against peace,

49:33.476 --> 49:36.812
war crimes
and crimes against humanity.

49:36.937 --> 49:40.190
D'SOUZA: Fascism became the
quintessential reference point

49:40.315 --> 49:41.733
for human evil.

49:49.866 --> 49:51.742
MAN: ...opposition
by political parties

49:51.867 --> 49:54.411
which might defeat or obstruct

49:54.537 --> 49:56.622
the policy of the Nazi Party.

50:05.296 --> 50:08.341
MAN: Hermann Wilhelm Goring,
on the counts of the indictment

50:08.466 --> 50:09.926
which you
have been convicted,

50:10.051 --> 50:13.012
the Tribunal sentences you
to death by hanging.

50:15.389 --> 50:17.933
D'SOUZA: American progressives
were in a panic.

50:19.643 --> 50:22.938
They realized that if future
generations of Americans

50:23.063 --> 50:26.274
knew the intimate connection
between progressivism

50:26.399 --> 50:29.110
and the Democratic Party
on the one hand,

50:29.235 --> 50:31.737
and the fascists and Nazis
on the other,

50:31.862 --> 50:34.448
they would be finished.

50:34.573 --> 50:38.285
And so, taking a page
from Hitler himself,

50:38.410 --> 50:41.580
they settled upon the idea
of a big lie.

50:41.705 --> 50:46.126
First, they would muddle
the meaning of fascism itself.

50:46.251 --> 50:50.254
They would take the socialism
out of National Socialism.

50:50.379 --> 50:54.425
Second, they would move fascism
from the left-wing column,

50:54.550 --> 50:59.012
where it had always belonged,
into the right-wing column.

50:59.137 --> 51:01.848
But we must not believe
that big lie.

51:01.973 --> 51:05.185
The fascists and the Nazis
were always on the left.

51:05.310 --> 51:08.021
They formed
a mutual admiration society

51:08.146 --> 51:09.731
with the American left.

51:09.856 --> 51:12.066
Even worse,
the most destructive

51:12.191 --> 51:15.402
and genocidal schemes
of the fascists and Nazis

51:15.527 --> 51:18.197
were inspired
by American progressives

51:18.322 --> 51:20.615
and the American
Democratic Party.

51:20.741 --> 51:24.286
That is the crushing
historical truth.

51:24.411 --> 51:28.539
<i>Now we go from the left's
big lie about fascism</i>

51:28.665 --> 51:31.417
to its big lie about racism.

51:31.542 --> 51:34.170
Progressive Democrats
typically blame racism

51:34.295 --> 51:36.880
on America,
and on the founding,

51:37.006 --> 51:39.883
but were the founders to blame
for the elaborate system

51:40.008 --> 51:42.511
of slave plantations?

51:42.636 --> 51:46.222
Historian Allen Guelzo
teaches at Gettysburg College

51:46.347 --> 51:49.058
and is the author
of several award-winning books

51:49.183 --> 51:51.102
on the Civil War.

51:51.227 --> 51:52.978
If we speak
of the founders as a whole,

51:53.104 --> 51:55.731
would it be accurate
to say that they believed A)

51:55.856 --> 51:59.193
slavery is on a path
of extinction;

51:59.318 --> 52:02.946
and B) that slavery is a...

52:03.071 --> 52:04.948
a regrettable thing,
a bad thing?

52:05.073 --> 52:06.699
They were confident

52:06.825 --> 52:08.701
that slavery
was going to disappear,

52:08.826 --> 52:10.369
because it is a contradiction

52:10.495 --> 52:13.247
-of our fundamental principles.
- Are you saying

52:13.372 --> 52:17.001
<i>that there really wasn't a...
formal pro-slavery ideology</i>

52:17.126 --> 52:19.002
at the time of the founding?

52:19.127 --> 52:22.214
GUELZO: There's no
pro-slavery philosophy

52:22.339 --> 52:23.798
that works into the founding.

52:23.924 --> 52:26.050
D'SOUZA: The founders
took specific measures

52:26.176 --> 52:27.677
to restrict slavery.

52:27.802 --> 52:30.304
They outlawed the slave trade,

52:30.429 --> 52:33.933
they prohibited slavery in
the vast Northwest Territories,

52:34.058 --> 52:35.935
under the Northwest Ordinance,

52:36.060 --> 52:39.021
and they mounted such
a strong critique of slavery

52:39.146 --> 52:41.356
that by the end
of the founding era,

52:41.481 --> 52:43.441
slavery went
from being a national

52:43.567 --> 52:45.443
to a regional institution.

52:45.568 --> 52:46.861
Then this happened.

52:46.986 --> 52:48.529
NARRATOR:
All over the world, the impact

52:48.655 --> 52:52.074
of this simple invention
was felt almost immediately.

52:52.199 --> 52:55.661
Eli Whitney put together
a few boards and rollers,

52:55.786 --> 52:58.288
and gave the world
a giant industry.

52:58.413 --> 53:00.749
Cotton was king.

53:02.459 --> 53:05.378
D'SOUZA: This new,
expanded plantation system

53:05.503 --> 53:08.840
demanded a political party
to defend its interests."

53:08.965 --> 53:12.134
the Democratic Party.

53:12.259 --> 53:14.011
At the time of the founders,
they thought slavery

53:14.136 --> 53:15.387
was a dying institution,

53:15.512 --> 53:17.264
but in the 19th century,
that had changed.

53:17.389 --> 53:19.224
They now began
to talk about slavery

53:19.349 --> 53:20.642
as a progressive institution.

53:20.767 --> 53:22.310
And why not?

53:22.435 --> 53:25.146
As George Fitzhugh,
one of the principal

53:25.271 --> 53:27.899
pro-slavery propagandists,
argued:

53:28.024 --> 53:30.359
Isn't slavery the same thing

53:30.485 --> 53:33.487
as what we are reading about
among European socialists?

53:33.612 --> 53:36.782
What else is slavery,
Fitzhugh argued,

53:36.907 --> 53:39.493
but a practical form
of socialism?

53:41.536 --> 53:44.914
D'SOUZA: Fitzhugh even tried to
sell his idea to black leaders.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.541
He defends slavery

53:46.666 --> 53:49.794
as an early form
of the welfare state.

53:49.919 --> 53:52.296
Fitzhugh argues
that in slavery,

53:52.421 --> 53:54.048
unlike in capitalism,

53:54.173 --> 53:56.008
the slaves who cannot
provide for themselves

53:56.133 --> 54:00.387
are looked after
from cradle to grave.

54:00.512 --> 54:03.181
If you took the logic
of that argument-- the idea

54:03.306 --> 54:06.309
that the slave plantation
is a kind of extended family,

54:06.434 --> 54:08.561
that from each
according to his abilities

54:08.686 --> 54:10.438
to each according to his need--

54:10.563 --> 54:12.023
Marxian principle--

54:12.148 --> 54:14.066
that this was
not only an excuse

54:14.191 --> 54:17.069
for enslaving black people, but
there was nothing in the logic

54:17.194 --> 54:19.363
that prevented you
from enslaving a white guy.

54:19.488 --> 54:21.073
Why not enslave white people?

54:21.198 --> 54:23.742
Or at least reduce them
to an economic status

54:23.867 --> 54:25.326
little better than that.

54:25.452 --> 54:26.911
Why not also extend slavery

54:27.036 --> 54:29.122
into the Northern, free states?

54:29.247 --> 54:31.332
Lincoln thought he discerned

54:31.457 --> 54:33.334
the hand of a plot here.

54:33.459 --> 54:36.462
Would it be accurate to say
that one of the key differences

54:36.587 --> 54:38.881
between the Republican
and the Democratic Party

54:39.006 --> 54:42.259
is that the one party
is founded on the idea

54:42.384 --> 54:44.886
of keeping the fruits
of your labor,

54:45.011 --> 54:46.679
and the other party
is founded on the idea,

54:46.804 --> 54:49.474
we get to take your stuff,
either for our own use

54:49.599 --> 54:52.059
or because we've got
some other, better use for it?

54:52.184 --> 54:54.979
That became the credo
of the Democratic Party.

54:55.104 --> 54:58.190
D'SOUZA: The great opponent
of the Democratic plantation

54:58.315 --> 54:59.858
was Abraham Lincoln.

54:59.983 --> 55:03.320
In a phrase, Lincoln
described the evil of slavery

55:03.445 --> 55:04.946
at its core.

55:05.071 --> 55:08.074
LINCOLN (dramatized): You toil
and work and earn bread,

55:08.199 --> 55:10.409
<i>and I'll eat it.</i>

55:10.535 --> 55:14.205
Whenever I hear someone
arguing for slavery,

55:14.330 --> 55:17.249
I feel a strong impulse
to see it tried out,

55:17.374 --> 55:19.626
on him personally.

55:19.751 --> 55:22.212
D'SOUZA:
Lincoln ruthlessly exposed

55:22.337 --> 55:25.465
Democratic hypocrisy.

55:25.590 --> 55:28.176
Wolves devouring lambs--

55:28.301 --> 55:31.554
not because it is good
for their own greedy maws,

55:31.679 --> 55:33.681
but because it is good
for the lambs.

55:33.806 --> 55:37.935
<i>GUELZO: For Lincoln,
the fundamental sin of slavery</i>

55:38.060 --> 55:39.311
curiously enough

55:39.436 --> 55:41.730
was not its racial aspect--

55:41.855 --> 55:43.148
that comes after.

55:43.273 --> 55:46.276
The fundamental sin
of slavery is theft.

55:46.401 --> 55:48.277
Because it says:

55:48.403 --> 55:50.530
You work, you toil,

55:50.655 --> 55:53.199
I will take
the proceeds of that.

55:53.324 --> 55:55.868
And Lincoln 's great anxiety
was to point out

55:55.993 --> 55:59.121
how Northern Democrats
had conspired together

55:59.246 --> 56:01.998
with Southern Democrats
to promote justifications

56:02.124 --> 56:06.085
of taking away the fruit
of other people 's labor.

56:06.211 --> 56:08.880
D'SOUZA: Guelzo is exposing
the progressive strategy

56:09.005 --> 56:11.299
of blaming slavery
on the South.

56:11.424 --> 56:13.634
The Northern Democrats
were in league

56:13.759 --> 56:15.386
with the Southern Democrats,

56:15.511 --> 56:18.263
making slavery the sin
not of the South,

56:18.388 --> 56:22.058
nor of America,
but of the Democratic Party.

56:22.184 --> 56:25.603
GUELZO: Northern Democrats were
fully as complicit in this

56:25.728 --> 56:28.356
as Southern Democrats.

56:28.481 --> 56:31.484
<i>D'SOUZA: The powerful New York
Democrat Martin Van Buren</i>

56:31.609 --> 56:35.779
applied the idea of rural
plantations in the South

56:35.904 --> 56:39.700
to urban centers in the North.

56:39.825 --> 56:42.160
When new immigrants
came to America,

56:42.285 --> 56:44.829
they were poor,
insecure, desperate.

56:44.954 --> 56:47.498
Some came as
indentured servants.

56:47.624 --> 56:50.042
Like the slave populations
in the South,

56:50.168 --> 56:52.378
they were a vulnerable people.

56:52.503 --> 56:56.507
Van Buren created an army
of big-city bosses,

56:56.632 --> 56:59.843
like Boss Tweed, who ran
Tammany Hall in New York City,

56:59.968 --> 57:01.553
who would raid the treasury

57:01.678 --> 57:05.223
and use the money
to create a patronage system

57:05.348 --> 57:07.225
that would keep
immigrant populations

57:07.350 --> 57:10.394
collectively dependent on,
and voting for,

57:10.520 --> 57:12.438
the Democratic machines,

57:12.563 --> 57:14.815
like in this scene
from Gangs of New York.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.817
MAN:
...take the chill off your soul

57:16.942 --> 57:18.485
and the weight off your heart.

57:18.610 --> 57:20.362
Welcome to America, son.

57:20.487 --> 57:22.280
Your long,
arduous journey is over.

57:22.405 --> 57:23.949
MAN 2:
Go back to your own country!

57:24.074 --> 57:25.116
MAN 3:
Vote Tammany!

57:26.910 --> 57:28.661
D'SOUZA:
So, before the Civil War,

57:28.786 --> 57:30.621
the Democrats' majority status

57:30.746 --> 57:34.458
depended upon rural plantations
in the South

57:34.583 --> 57:37.419
and urban plantations
in the North.

57:39.046 --> 57:41.631
Lincoln warned that the goal
of the Democratic Party

57:41.757 --> 57:46.010
was to turn all of America
into a plantation.

57:46.136 --> 57:49.305
To stop Lincoln,
the Democrats went to war.

57:55.477 --> 57:57.729
Lincoln won the war
and demolished

57:57.855 --> 57:59.690
the old Democratic plantation.

58:01.441 --> 58:02.984
Republicans took steps

58:03.109 --> 58:06.613
to integrate former slaves
into American life,

58:06.738 --> 58:10.616
to create for the first time
a multiracial democracy.

58:10.741 --> 58:12.285
Republicans pushed through

58:12.410 --> 58:15.287
three landmark
constitutional amendments,

58:15.412 --> 58:18.957
freeing the slaves,
guaranteeing the right to vote,

58:19.082 --> 58:22.586
and securing equal rights
under the law.

58:22.711 --> 58:25.296
The Democrats overwhelmingly
opposed all three.

58:25.422 --> 58:27.131
And these were
the Northern Democrats.

58:27.257 --> 58:28.591
The Southern Democrats

58:28.716 --> 58:31.761
<i>had not yet been
let back into the Union.</i>

58:31.886 --> 58:33.596
The Democrats needed

58:33.721 --> 58:35.848
<i>a new enslavement strategy</i>

58:35.973 --> 58:37.891
and someone to implement it.

58:38.016 --> 58:40.602
Democratic President
Woodrow Wilson knew

58:40.727 --> 58:42.687
the national government
had defeated

58:42.812 --> 58:44.689
the old slave plantation,

58:44.814 --> 58:47.108
so he and other
progressives wanted

58:47.233 --> 58:50.945
a new plantation system ruled
by the national government

58:51.070 --> 58:53.614
so it would last forever.

58:53.739 --> 58:57.534
Wilson's first step:
federal segregation.

58:57.659 --> 58:59.369
He forced his departments
to establish

58:59.494 --> 59:03.123
separate workstations
and restrooms for blacks.

59:03.248 --> 59:07.752
Wilson's second step:
racial terrorism.

59:07.877 --> 59:10.546
Wilson screened the film
Birth of a Nation

59:10.671 --> 59:12.882
in the White House.

59:13.007 --> 59:17.386
It spurred a national revival
of the Ku Klux Klan.

59:17.511 --> 59:19.388
The Klan
had previously been confined

59:19.513 --> 59:21.681
to a handful
of Southern states.

59:21.807 --> 59:24.517
Now it stretched
from coast to coast.

59:24.642 --> 59:28.396
The Klan became
the domestic terrorist arm

59:28.521 --> 59:30.398
of the Democratic Party.

59:30.523 --> 59:32.650
Wilson was the first
progressive president.

59:32.775 --> 59:35.152
"Progressive" here
means progress

59:35.277 --> 59:38.071
toward the powerful
centralized state

59:38.197 --> 59:41.825
and away from
the American founding.

59:41.950 --> 59:44.202
In the Democrats'
new plantation scheme,

59:44.327 --> 59:46.871
the big house
is the White House,

59:46.996 --> 59:50.708
and the plantation master
is the president.

59:56.213 --> 59:59.716
Now let's turn
to modern racism,

59:59.841 --> 01:00:02.427
racism in the post-war era.

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:07.390
Here's what the left says:

01:00:07.515 --> 01:00:10.268
The Democrats may have been
the party of racism

01:00:10.393 --> 01:00:12.311
a longtime ago,

01:00:12.436 --> 01:00:14.188
but they underwent
a conversion.

01:00:14.313 --> 01:00:18.233
Now they are the champions
of civil rights.

01:00:18.358 --> 01:00:21.236
The left insists that
in the 1960s,

01:00:21.361 --> 01:00:24.656
the two parties switched sides,

01:00:24.781 --> 01:00:28.201
brought about by Richard
Nixon's Southern strategy.

01:00:28.326 --> 01:00:31.412
Supposedly,
Nixon converted the racists

01:00:31.537 --> 01:00:34.248
in the Democratic Party,
the Dixiecrats,

01:00:34.373 --> 01:00:36.667
into Republicans.

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:39.253
So, today,
Democrats are the good guys,

01:00:39.378 --> 01:00:42.464
and Trump and the Republicans
are the bad guys.

01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:45.050
Did Nixon have
a campaign strategy

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:48.136
that appealed to the racists
of the Deep South?

01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:49.637
No one has uncovered

01:00:49.762 --> 01:00:54.058
a single racist
campaign statement by Nixon.

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:57.227
So the left says
Nixon used crime and drugs

01:00:57.352 --> 01:00:59.813
as a code for racism,

01:00:59.938 --> 01:01:02.190
but in fact,
Nixonian resentment

01:01:02.315 --> 01:01:05.902
was directed against
the Vietnam draft dodgers

01:01:06.027 --> 01:01:08.863
and the militant
anti-war protesters

01:01:08.988 --> 01:01:12.033
and the drug-smoking hippies.

01:01:12.158 --> 01:01:14.076
You might recognize
the unofficial anthem

01:01:14.201 --> 01:01:15.619
of the Nixon voters,

01:01:15.744 --> 01:01:18.288
composed by country singer
Merle Haggard.

01:01:44.062 --> 01:01:45.605
Kevin Phillips, the author

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:47.774
of The Emerging
Republican Majority,

01:01:47.899 --> 01:01:50.109
is supposed to be the architect

01:01:50.234 --> 01:01:52.862
of Nixon's Southern strategy.

01:01:52.987 --> 01:01:55.072
But Phillips reveals
that Nixon didn't have

01:01:55.197 --> 01:01:57.032
a Southern strategy.

01:01:57.157 --> 01:01:59.409
He had a Sunbelt strategy.

01:01:59.534 --> 01:02:01.620
Nixon wanted to appeal

01:02:01.745 --> 01:02:04.831
to those urban,
upwardly mobile voters

01:02:04.956 --> 01:02:08.126
stretching all the way
from Florida to California.

01:02:08.251 --> 01:02:11.712
This strategy included
the Peripheral or Upper South,

01:02:11.837 --> 01:02:15.382
but it did not include
the Deep South.

01:02:15.507 --> 01:02:17.718
Nixon won the Sunbelt,

01:02:17.843 --> 01:02:20.387
and he lost the Deep South

01:02:20.512 --> 01:02:24.349
<i>to Democratic segregationist
George Wallace.</i>

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.601
One of the first things
Nixon did

01:02:26.726 --> 01:02:30.688
when he took office in 1969
was to introduce

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:33.858
America's first
affirmative action program.

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:36.151
MAN :
President Nixon is helping, uh,

01:02:36.276 --> 01:02:38.820
minority people through his
black entrepreneurship program.

01:02:38.946 --> 01:02:40.822
D'SOUZA:
Now, would a racist president

01:02:40.947 --> 01:02:43.116
playing to a racist base

01:02:43.241 --> 01:02:45.785
give legal preferences
to blacks over whites?

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:47.370
Absurd.

01:02:47.495 --> 01:02:49.664
And what about
those Dixiecrats?

01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:53.250
How many of them
became Republicans?

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:55.919
Here is a list of
senators and congressmen

01:02:56.045 --> 01:02:58.172
<i>who joined the Dixiecrat Party</i>

01:02:58.297 --> 01:03:02.008
or voted against
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

01:03:02.134 --> 01:03:05.136
In the House,
just one switched parties:

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:06.513
Albert Watson.

01:03:06.638 --> 01:03:08.598
In the Senate, just one:

01:03:08.681 --> 01:03:10.183
Strom Thurmond.

01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:14.311
All the other Dixiecrats
stayed in the Democratic Party.

01:03:14.436 --> 01:03:16.271
They died as Democrats.

01:03:16.397 --> 01:03:17.356
Case in point...

01:03:17.481 --> 01:03:18.690
Today, our country has lost

01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:20.108
a true American original,

01:03:20.233 --> 01:03:22.861
my friend and mentor,
Robert C. Byrd.

01:03:22.986 --> 01:03:24.696
D'SOUZA:
This is the former Klansman

01:03:24.821 --> 01:03:27.615
who led the filibuster
against the Civil Rights Act.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.743
Obama and Bill Clinton
attended his memorial service.

01:03:30.868 --> 01:03:33.913
They mention that he once had
a fleeting association

01:03:34.038 --> 01:03:35.581
with the Ku Klux Klan.

01:03:35.706 --> 01:03:37.791
And what does that mean?
I'll tell you what it means.

01:03:37.916 --> 01:03:40.002
He was a country boy
from the hills and the hollows

01:03:40.127 --> 01:03:43.213
of West Virginia.
He was trying to get elected.

01:03:43.338 --> 01:03:46.674
D'SOUZA: The South's enduring
shift into the Republican camp

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:50.511
came not in the Nixon
but in the Reagan era.

01:03:50.636 --> 01:03:54.014
Reagan defended patriotism,
free markets,

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.016
family values,
religious liberty.

01:03:56.141 --> 01:03:57.684
He was pro-life.

01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:00.437
It had nothing to do with race.

01:04:00.562 --> 01:04:03.440
As the South
became less racist,

01:04:03.565 --> 01:04:05.859
it became more Republican.

01:04:05.984 --> 01:04:08.319
So, the progressive
Democratic claim

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:10.488
that the parties switched sides

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.823
and the Democrats
are now the good guys

01:04:12.948 --> 01:04:14.867
and Republicans
are the bad guys

01:04:14.992 --> 01:04:17.453
is a big lie.

01:04:17.578 --> 01:04:20.205
Time to fast-forward
to the present.

01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:23.416
The Democrats
have just one card left,

01:04:23.541 --> 01:04:24.834
Charlottesville.

01:04:37.346 --> 01:04:40.474
There they are,
white supremacists

01:04:40.599 --> 01:04:42.309
<i>and nee-Nazis in Trump hats.</i>

01:04:42.434 --> 01:04:46.688
Doesn't that prove that racism
today is on the right?

01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:49.524
Jason Kessler organized
the Charlottesville rally.

01:04:49.649 --> 01:04:51.359
He is routinely portrayed

01:04:51.484 --> 01:04:54.236
as a white supremacist
and a right-winger.

01:04:54.361 --> 01:04:56.572
But when
the Southern Poverty Law Center

01:04:56.697 --> 01:04:58.407
looked into his past,

01:04:58.532 --> 01:05:00.826
they found an Obama supporter

01:05:00.951 --> 01:05:04.454
who was active in
the left-wing Occupy movement.

01:05:04.579 --> 01:05:07.081
I exposed this on social media.

01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:08.916
<i>He didn't '1' like it.</i>

01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:11.127
Dinesh, (bleep) you.
You go back to India.

01:05:11.252 --> 01:05:12.461
You shouldn't be here.

01:05:12.586 --> 01:05:14.463
Number one,
you were born in India,

01:05:14.588 --> 01:05:16.799
and you're just like
the other people coming over

01:05:16.924 --> 01:05:19.092
on these H1B1 visas.

01:05:19.218 --> 01:05:21.928
(Indian accent): "Hello, sir.
Uh, how are you doing today?"

01:05:22.053 --> 01:05:23.597
We don't need you, okay?

01:05:23.722 --> 01:05:26.015
D'SOUZA:
But what does Kessler believe?

01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:28.601
I mean, there is
a problem with bankers.

01:05:28.726 --> 01:05:30.686
There is a problem
with the wealthiest people

01:05:30.811 --> 01:05:31.938
in this country...

01:05:32.063 --> 01:05:33.189
D'SOUZA:
He still seems to me

01:05:33.314 --> 01:05:35.524
to be pan'
of that Occupy movement.

01:05:35.649 --> 01:05:37.359
I decided to talk to someone

01:05:37.484 --> 01:05:39.611
even more notorious
than Kessler,

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:42.697
the poster boy
of white supremacy.

01:05:42.822 --> 01:05:45.492
Hail our people. Hail victory!

01:05:53.624 --> 01:05:56.585
Protests over Richard Spencer's
visit turning violent.

01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:59.129
White nationalist
Richard Spencer

01:05:59.254 --> 01:06:01.590
is speaking
at the University of Florida.

01:06:01.715 --> 01:06:03.174
The Governor Rick Scott
did declare

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.135
a state of an emergency.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.387
- Pepe's become kind of a symbol...
- MAN: Oh!

01:06:07.512 --> 01:06:08.971
Africans have benefited

01:06:09.097 --> 01:06:11.599
from their experience
with white supremacy.

01:06:11.724 --> 01:06:13.434
- You're a bigot.
- If Africans had never existed,

01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:15.728
world history would be ex...
almost exactly the same

01:06:15.853 --> 01:06:17.729
-as it is today.
- Yeah, you just keep saying...

01:06:17.855 --> 01:06:19.314
Because we are the genius
that drives it.

01:06:19.439 --> 01:06:20.649
You keep saying
ignorant things.

01:06:20.774 --> 01:06:22.734
You don't get to tell me
what I will be.

01:06:22.859 --> 01:06:24.819
Yeah, I do, actually. Because
my name's Richard Spencer.

01:06:24.944 --> 01:06:28.072
Richard Spencer, founder of the
so-called alt-right movement...

01:06:28.197 --> 01:06:30.575
Their movement is broadly
referred to as "alt-right."

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.702
Richard Spencer, a prominent
member of the alt-right...

01:06:33.828 --> 01:06:36.246
D'SOUZA: What does Richard
Spencer actually believe?

01:06:36.372 --> 01:06:38.165
People have called you a Nazi.

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:40.125
Uh, are you a Nazi?

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.960
Oh, no, l-l'm not a Nazi.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:44.170
I'm not a neo-Nazi.
I'm not any of those things.

01:06:44.295 --> 01:06:48.174
Now, you say you're not
a neo-Nazi or a Nazi, and yet,

01:06:48.299 --> 01:06:50.676
in the event that you had
right around the time

01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:53.929
-of Trump's inauguration...
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:54.054 --> 01:06:56.307
...there were a whole bunch
of guys who were giving

01:06:56.432 --> 01:06:58.475
the Nazi salute.
You saw them.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.185
- Sure.
- You didn't repudiate them.

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.729
- No.
- So you thought it was okay

01:07:02.854 --> 01:07:04.939
to have some Nazi salutes

01:07:05.065 --> 01:07:07.900
that... in response
to what you were saying.

01:07:08.026 --> 01:07:09.527
Um, I uttered the words,

01:07:09.652 --> 01:07:12.738
"Hail Trump, hail our people,
hail victory."

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:17.201
Doesn't "Hail Trump" sound
unnervingly like "Heil Hitler"?

01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:18.744
Uh, sure. It was...
I was being

01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:20.037
-very provocative.
-Isn't that why you...

01:07:20.162 --> 01:07:21.121
You were being provocative.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:22.539
Isn't it fair to say

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:24.374
that you're... that you know

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:27.752
that there is a...
a media left out there

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.712
that is looking

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:33.049
to pin neo-Nazism on the right,

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.050
and by doing
this kind of thing,

01:07:35.175 --> 01:07:37.594
you're actually playing a part

01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:40.389
in a script, you're actually
giving them what they want,

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:42.516
which gives you
a lot of media attention,

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:44.476
it serves their script,

01:07:44.601 --> 01:07:47.937
-but it actually hurts Trump?
- Uh, no,

01:07:48.062 --> 01:07:49.939
I don't think the alt-right
has hurt Trump

01:07:50.064 --> 01:07:52.525
-in the slightest bit.
- Would it be fair to say

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.527
that you are not just
against illegal immigration,

01:07:54.652 --> 01:07:56.445
but immigration, period?

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.114
I would be actually happy
to open the door

01:07:59.239 --> 01:08:00.657
to white South Africans.

01:08:00.782 --> 01:08:02.909
Would you be happy
with an immigration policy

01:08:03.034 --> 01:08:04.369
that basically said,

01:08:04.494 --> 01:08:08.164
"We want people
from New Zealand, Australia,

01:08:08.289 --> 01:08:10.458
"uh, white guys from Europe,

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:13.044
"Iceland and South Africa;

01:08:13.169 --> 01:08:15.129
"we don't want
that many people

01:08:15.254 --> 01:08:18.465
-from, if any,
Barbados or Bombay"? -Yes.

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:20.884
Now, this seems very different
than... than Trump.

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:23.886
And by that, I mean,
isn't it true that the line

01:08:24.011 --> 01:08:26.890
that Trump is drawing
is not a racial line

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:29.934
but a line between the legal
and the illegal immigrant?

01:08:30.059 --> 01:08:31.435
He's... he's made
a difference between

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.728
the illegal and legal, sure.

01:08:32.853 --> 01:08:34.604
But I ultimately
don't support that.

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:37.149
Trump was quoted
in the paper as saying:

01:08:37.274 --> 01:08:40.152
If there's an Indian guy
working in Silicon Valley,

01:08:40.277 --> 01:08:45.073
and his visa runs out
and we have to send him home,

01:08:45.198 --> 01:08:47.951
that's a loss, that's something
we should try to prevent.

01:08:48.076 --> 01:08:50.495
- You disagree?
- I do disagree with that.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.872
The H1B visa program

01:08:52.997 --> 01:08:56.792
has been totally detrimental
to white people.

01:08:56.917 --> 01:08:59.169
In Richard Spencer's world,
what would you do

01:08:59.294 --> 01:09:00.837
with non-white immigrants
who are here?

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:02.631
- Uh-huh.
- Good example would be me.

01:09:02.756 --> 01:09:05.633
I'm a naturalized U.S. citizen.
Would you send me home?

01:09:05.759 --> 01:09:08.094
I hope that
we can begin to pursue

01:09:08.219 --> 01:09:10.888
a new policy of re-immigration.

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:13.432
And that would be
about allowing people

01:09:13.557 --> 01:09:14.892
to go home again.

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:17.853
I mean, I hear you echoing

01:09:17.978 --> 01:09:19.604
a white Malcolm X philosophy.

01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:21.689
<i>NEWS</i> MAN: <i>Is it fair to say,</i>

01:09:21.814 --> 01:09:25.026
as a generality and as a...
succinct way to put it,

01:09:25.151 --> 01:09:27.403
that you believe
in segregation of the races?

01:09:27.528 --> 01:09:29.197
We do believe in separation.

01:09:29.322 --> 01:09:30.615
Standing on our own feet,

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.241
among our...
among our own kind,

01:09:32.366 --> 01:09:33.868
and solving our own problems.

01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:36.036
And that's the only way
you'll get a solution

01:09:36.161 --> 01:09:38.747
to the vital race problem
in this country.

01:09:38.872 --> 01:09:42.125
Mr. Muhammad teaches us
to love our own kind

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.294
and let the white man
take care of himself.

01:09:44.419 --> 01:09:46.921
And so, if you and Malcolm X
were at the table,

01:09:47.046 --> 01:09:48.923
you'd get along just fine.

01:09:49.048 --> 01:09:50.633
I think we could have
a respectful dialogue

01:09:50.758 --> 01:09:52.635
if Malcolm X were at the table.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.721
Do you agree that
what you're articulating

01:09:55.846 --> 01:09:58.849
is a philosophy
that was very prevalent

01:09:58.974 --> 01:10:00.517
among, really,
progressive Democrats

01:10:00.642 --> 01:10:02.310
in the early 20th century?

01:10:02.435 --> 01:10:05.230
I-I am sure there are instances

01:10:05.355 --> 01:10:09.525
in which left-wing thinkers
or entities

01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:11.611
adopted nationalism.

01:10:11.736 --> 01:10:13.696
What it means to be
on the right, what it means

01:10:13.821 --> 01:10:16.740
to be a conservative, is
actually deeply collectivist.

01:10:16.865 --> 01:10:18.492
It is not individualistic
at all.

01:10:18.617 --> 01:10:20.869
Pause for a moment. So, as--
I would say-- as a conservative,

01:10:20.994 --> 01:10:22.913
I'm conserving...

01:10:23.038 --> 01:10:25.248
the philosophy
and the principles

01:10:25.373 --> 01:10:27.375
of the American founding--
you're not?

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.585
I've been critical
of the American founding,

01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:32.380
and throughout my writings
and my career, sure.

01:10:32.505 --> 01:10:34.423
Uh, what's... what was wrong
with the American founding?

01:10:34.548 --> 01:10:36.759
This notion that
we will create a state

01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:39.303
to protect human rights
or-or individual rights.

01:10:39.428 --> 01:10:41.638
I mean, no state
in the history of the world,

01:10:41.763 --> 01:10:44.099
including the United States,
was ever created like that.

01:10:44.224 --> 01:10:47.602
So all men are created equal.
True or false?

01:10:47.727 --> 01:10:49.896
- False, obviously.
- What about the idea that...

01:10:50.021 --> 01:10:51.814
No...! one actually believes that.

01:10:51.939 --> 01:10:53.816
I mean, seriously.
No...! one believes that.

01:10:53.941 --> 01:10:55.109
The idea that, let's say,

01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:56.860
we have a right to life.
True or false?

01:10:56.985 --> 01:10:58.529
A ri...
I don't think we have rights

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.072
to, really, anything.

01:11:00.197 --> 01:11:02.407
I don't think we
should ever pledge allegiance

01:11:02.532 --> 01:11:05.285
or worship legal documents.

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:07.996
And would you agree
that at the end of the day

01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:10.790
it is the individual
who serves the state

01:11:10.915 --> 01:11:12.792
and not the other way around?

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:15.669
There are duties
that we have to the state.

01:11:15.794 --> 01:11:18.088
But this notion of a limited
government which, you know,

01:11:18.213 --> 01:11:20.132
as you know,
the founders saw the government

01:11:20.257 --> 01:11:21.925
as the enemy of our rights.

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:23.760
- Uh, in other words...
- Not really.

01:11:23.885 --> 01:11:25.470
- Well, look at the...
- That's Reaganism.

01:11:25.595 --> 01:11:26.888
Well, let's look
at the Bill of Rights.

01:11:27.013 --> 01:11:28.348
Congress shall make no law
doing this,

01:11:28.473 --> 01:11:30.057
and Congress
shall make no law doing that.

01:11:30.183 --> 01:11:31.851
So our rights--
our First Amendment right,

01:11:31.934 --> 01:11:33.602
our Second Amendment right,
to own a gun,

01:11:33.727 --> 01:11:34.854
our Fourth Amendment right--

01:11:34.979 --> 01:11:37.231
are seen as protections

01:11:37.356 --> 01:11:38.232
against a government.

01:11:38.357 --> 01:11:40.484
No...! individual has a right

01:11:40.609 --> 01:11:42.819
outside
of a collective community.

01:11:42.944 --> 01:11:44.946
You have rights

01:11:45.071 --> 01:11:48.074
not eternally or given by God
or by nature...

01:11:48.199 --> 01:11:50.201
- Who gives them to us?
- Ult... You have them

01:11:50.326 --> 01:11:52.495
because you are part
of this community.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.538
Ultimately, the state
gives those rights to you.

01:11:54.663 --> 01:11:56.874
So the state is the source
of rights, not the individual.

01:11:56.999 --> 01:11:58.500
It simply is.

01:11:58.625 --> 01:12:00.419
What would be your take
on, say, Reagan?

01:12:00.544 --> 01:12:01.878
I do not think that
he was a great president.

01:12:02.003 --> 01:12:03.505
Who's your favorite president?

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:06.257
There is something
about, uh, Jackson.

01:12:06.382 --> 01:12:08.551
There's something
about Polk as well,

01:12:08.676 --> 01:12:10.720
someone who
only served one term.

01:12:10.845 --> 01:12:13.055
But, I mean, Jackson and Polk,
as you know, both Democrats.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.015
Uh,party

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:19.436
I mean, party is just the...
the vessel that-that one uses.

01:12:19.561 --> 01:12:21.938
I mean, Jackson's the founder
of the Democratic Party.

01:12:22.063 --> 01:12:25.525
You can find, perhaps,
elective affinities,

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:28.486
uh, perhaps kind of
ironic affin... affinities

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:31.948
between myself
as an identitarian

01:12:32.073 --> 01:12:35.909
and a progressive Democrat
from the 1920s or something.

01:12:36.035 --> 01:12:38.036
Have you seen the movie
Birth of a Nation?

01:12:38.162 --> 01:12:40.330
- Uh, yes, I have.
- What do you think of it?

01:12:40.455 --> 01:12:42.332
Uh, it's an amazing film.

01:12:42.457 --> 01:12:44.626
One of the most
important films ever made.

01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:46.461
Certainly a racialist
component to that.

01:12:46.586 --> 01:12:49.464
It appealed to many Americans,
including many presidents.

01:12:49.589 --> 01:12:51.549
- It was screened in the...
- Right, well, that's my point,

01:12:51.674 --> 01:12:53.717
is that-that a progressive
Democrat, Woodrow Wilson,

01:12:53.843 --> 01:12:55.511
shows that movie
in the White House

01:12:55.636 --> 01:12:59.348
to the cabinet, and this leads
to a kind of Klan revival

01:12:59.473 --> 01:13:00.515
around the country.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.435
So you see why I'm placing you

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.937
in that tradition?

01:13:06.062 --> 01:13:08.231
Because those are...
that's your team.

01:13:08.356 --> 01:13:10.650
Uh... if that's progressivism,

01:13:10.775 --> 01:13:12.985
then I guess I'm a progressive.

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:14.570
Uh, I'm-I'm fine with that.

01:13:14.695 --> 01:13:16.488
Uh, International Socialism?

01:13:16.613 --> 01:13:20.200
Uh, I'm... to be honest, uh,
l-l'm not totally opposed

01:13:20.325 --> 01:13:23.078
to socialism when...
when done right.

01:13:23.203 --> 01:13:25.830
Uh, I think we actually
should use the government

01:13:25.955 --> 01:13:27.915
to benefit ourselves,
the people of this country.

01:13:28.041 --> 01:13:30.668
I think we should have
a national health care system,

01:13:30.793 --> 01:13:33.421
I think we should quadruple
national parks,

01:13:33.546 --> 01:13:36.590
I think we should make
this world a better place.

01:13:36.715 --> 01:13:39.176
And I think government has
a role to play in that.

01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:40.594
D'SOUZA:
Now, there's very little

01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:43.597
on which Spencer and Trump
actually agree.

01:13:43.722 --> 01:13:45.098
Trump's a flag-waving patriot

01:13:45.223 --> 01:13:47.225
who cherishes
the American founders.

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:49.769
Spencer isn't and doesn't.

01:13:49.894 --> 01:13:51.854
Trump's
a free-market capitalist.

01:13:51.979 --> 01:13:54.899
Spencer prefers
a strong centralized state

01:13:55.024 --> 01:13:58.777
regulating markets
and dispensing entitlements.

01:13:58.902 --> 01:14:00.737
Trump wants
to keep illegals out

01:14:00.862 --> 01:14:02.364
so legal immigrants
and citizens,

01:14:02.489 --> 01:14:04.616
whether white, black or brown,
can thrive.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:06.618
TRUMP:
No...! matter where they come from,

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:10.496
no matter
what faith they practice,

01:14:10.621 --> 01:14:12.540
they form a single,

01:14:12.665 --> 01:14:14.208
unbreakable team.

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:16.210
That's what we are--
we're a team.

01:14:16.335 --> 01:14:18.587
As a nation, we're a team.

01:14:18.712 --> 01:14:21.423
D'SOUZA: Spencer wants
only white immigrants.

01:14:21.548 --> 01:14:23.675
Trump believes that rights
come from God.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.469
TRUMP: No matter
what the color of our skin

01:14:26.594 --> 01:14:28.471
or the place of our birth,

01:14:28.596 --> 01:14:30.806
we are all
created equal by God.

01:14:30.932 --> 01:14:32.933
D'SOUZA:
Spencer is an atheist

01:14:33.059 --> 01:14:35.603
who believes our rights
come from the government.

01:14:35.728 --> 01:14:38.689
They call him alt-right,

01:14:38.814 --> 01:14:40.649
but he's not on the right.

01:14:40.774 --> 01:14:41.983
He's not a conservative.

01:14:42.108 --> 01:14:43.985
He's a tool of the media

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:46.112
to pin
the white supremacist tail

01:14:46.237 --> 01:14:48.656
on the Republican elephant.

01:14:48.781 --> 01:14:51.492
He's pan' of the big lie.

01:14:56.789 --> 01:14:58.874
We've talked
about the racist history

01:14:58.999 --> 01:15:01.168
of the Democratic Party,
stretching all the way

01:15:01.293 --> 01:15:05.088
to the present,
but where's the racism now?

01:15:05.213 --> 01:15:06.965
The Democratic
ethnic plantation

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:11.302
has expanded greatly
under Clinton and Obama.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.889
The historian Kenneth Stampp

01:15:15.014 --> 01:15:17.850
identifies the five
distinctive features

01:15:17.975 --> 01:15:20.894
of the slave plantation.

01:15:21.019 --> 01:15:23.480
Dilapidated housing.

01:15:23.605 --> 01:15:25.482
Broken families.

01:15:25.607 --> 01:15:27.900
A high degree of violence

01:15:28.026 --> 01:15:31.946
necessary to keep
the plantation together.

01:15:32.071 --> 01:15:34.114
No opportunity;
no one gets ahead.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.578
And a pervasive atmosphere
of nihilism and despair.

01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:42.747
Today, we find
those exact features

01:15:42.873 --> 01:15:46.668
in almost every city
the Democrats control--

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:48.503
in the black ghetto,

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:51.005
the Latino barrio,

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:53.716
and on the Native American
reservations.

01:15:56.969 --> 01:16:00.305
This is racism 's
contemporary face.

01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:02.599
Democrats try
to deflect attention

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:06.060
to a few powerless
white nationalists

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:09.564
so that we'll miss the racism
that is institutionalized

01:16:09.689 --> 01:16:12.858
within the modern
Democratic plantation.

01:16:12.983 --> 01:16:15.819
Trump, far from being
the problem,

01:16:15.944 --> 01:16:17.821
is actually
making things better.

01:16:17.946 --> 01:16:19.823
African-American unemployment

01:16:19.948 --> 01:16:22.909
stands at the lowest rate
ever recorded.

01:16:24.619 --> 01:16:29.582
...to make America great again
for all Americans.

01:16:33.544 --> 01:16:35.754
D'SOUZA:
And watch the reaction

01:16:35.879 --> 01:16:40.133
on the part of the overseers
of the Democratic plantation.

01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:46.598
And where's the fascism today?
It's not Trump.

01:16:46.723 --> 01:16:50.143
He's an American nationalist
who wants capitalism,

01:16:50.268 --> 01:16:52.520
limited government,
individual liberty

01:16:52.645 --> 01:16:54.230
and free speech.

01:16:54.355 --> 01:16:57.483
And nothing is more
anti-fascist than that.

01:16:57.608 --> 01:16:59.735
By contrast, under Obama,

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.863
we saw government control
increase dramatically

01:17:02.988 --> 01:17:04.989
over banks,
investment companies,

01:17:05.115 --> 01:17:08.701
energy companies,
the entire health care sector

01:17:08.826 --> 01:17:10.411
and education.

01:17:10.536 --> 01:17:13.289
This is state-run capitalism,

01:17:13.414 --> 01:17:17.209
which is the clinical
definition of fascism.

01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:20.754
A second manifestation
of fascism today

01:17:20.879 --> 01:17:23.423
is the deep state.

01:17:23.548 --> 01:17:26.426
The Democratic Party,
under Obama and Hillary,

01:17:26.551 --> 01:17:28.803
used the weapons of the state--

01:17:28.928 --> 01:17:32.807
the IRS, the FBI, the CIA,
the Justice Department--

01:17:32.932 --> 01:17:35.184
against their
political opponents.

01:17:35.309 --> 01:17:37.311
I saw this with my own eyes.

01:17:37.436 --> 01:17:39.187
The gangsterization
of the U.S. government

01:17:39.313 --> 01:17:41.356
and of American politics.

01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:44.901
This is about as close
as you can get

01:17:45.026 --> 01:17:47.612
to institutional fascism.

01:17:49.739 --> 01:17:52.116
And what about
the fascist insistence

01:17:52.241 --> 01:17:54.201
on cultural conformity,

01:17:54.326 --> 01:17:57.663
what the Nazis called
Gleichshaltung?

01:17:57.788 --> 01:18:01.083
Today's left calls this
"political correctness."

01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:04.169
They use political correctness
to establish

01:18:04.294 --> 01:18:06.754
a stranglehold over academia,

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.799
the media, entertainment.

01:18:09.924 --> 01:18:11.968
This enforced monopoly of views

01:18:12.093 --> 01:18:14.094
is also an example

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:17.181
of fascism on the left today.

01:18:20.017 --> 01:18:22.519
James O'Keefe is
the founder and president

01:18:22.644 --> 01:18:24.187
of Project Veritas,

01:18:24.312 --> 01:18:27.482
a group with
an unusual mission.

01:18:27.607 --> 01:18:30.318
O'KEEFE: The media
has protected the sacred cows--

01:18:30.443 --> 01:18:32.320
the Planned Parenthoods,
the NPRs,

01:18:32.445 --> 01:18:34.155
the ACORNs, and now Antifa--

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.990
and they've only given you
half the story.

01:18:36.115 --> 01:18:37.199
So, in order to expose

01:18:37.324 --> 01:18:39.117
the truth, we have to dig deep.

01:18:39.243 --> 01:18:40.577
We have to go undercover

01:18:40.702 --> 01:18:42.537
to unmask
what they really believe.

01:18:42.662 --> 01:18:45.915
D'SOUZA: What would you say
is the ideology of Antifa?

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.542
Well, they don't believe
in free speech.

01:18:47.667 --> 01:18:49.168
They don't believe in
the democratic process.

01:18:49.293 --> 01:18:50.878
They don't believe
in individual rights.

01:18:51.003 --> 01:18:52.838
They don't believe in...
anyone has a right

01:18:52.963 --> 01:18:54.465
to express themselves
or even exist

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:56.717
if it doesn't...
if it isn't consistent

01:18:56.842 --> 01:18:58.927
with their sort of
revolutionary actions.

01:18:59.052 --> 01:19:01.096
In our undercover journalism,
they actually joke

01:19:01.221 --> 01:19:03.306
about the fact
that it's not self-defense.

01:19:03.431 --> 01:19:05.934
D'SOUZA: Now, if I think
of paramilitary organizations

01:19:06.059 --> 01:19:07.644
that don't believe

01:19:07.769 --> 01:19:10.980
in free speech or tolerance
or the democratic process,

01:19:11.105 --> 01:19:13.315
I think
of not just the Communists,

01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:14.900
but the fascists.

01:19:15.025 --> 01:19:17.069
And yet here is an organization

01:19:17.194 --> 01:19:19.446
that purports to be
anti-fascist.

01:19:19.571 --> 01:19:21.948
Yeah, I think they have
a lot more in common

01:19:22.073 --> 01:19:23.783
with the Mussolinis,
the Brownshirts.

01:19:23.908 --> 01:19:25.493
In our undercover tapes,

01:19:25.618 --> 01:19:27.328
they're wearing black masks.

01:19:27.453 --> 01:19:30.039
That bears a lot more in common
with the fascism of, uh,

01:19:30.164 --> 01:19:33.334
the early 20th century than
they would have you believe.

01:19:33.459 --> 01:19:36.795
Who is fueling or funding

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.339
the groups
loosely called Antifa?

01:19:39.464 --> 01:19:41.925
Torn Steyer's name
came up a lot in California.

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:43.510
He's a billionaire.

01:19:43.635 --> 01:19:46.012
Another name
that's come up publicly--

01:19:46.137 --> 01:19:48.264
uh, open-source records--
has been

01:19:48.389 --> 01:19:50.183
George Soros.

01:19:50.308 --> 01:19:54.395
D'SOUZA: George Soros is one of
the richest men in the world.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.773
He styles himself
as anti-fascist,

01:19:57.856 --> 01:20:00.984
but his own history has
a different story to tell.

01:20:01.109 --> 01:20:03.028
STEVE KROFT:
When the Nazis

01:20:03.153 --> 01:20:05.738
occupied Budapest in 1944,

01:20:05.864 --> 01:20:08.449
George Soros's father
was a successful lawyer.

01:20:08.574 --> 01:20:10.660
He lived on an island
in the Danube

01:20:10.785 --> 01:20:13.162
<i>and liked to commute to work
in</i> a <i>rowboat.</i>

01:20:13.287 --> 01:20:15.581
But knowing there were problems
ahead for the Jews,

01:20:15.706 --> 01:20:17.749
he decided
to split his family up.

01:20:25.090 --> 01:20:27.342
WOMAN: No...!!

01:20:46.568 --> 01:20:48.194
KROFT: And he bribed
a government official

01:20:48.319 --> 01:20:50.655
to take 14-year-old
George Soros in

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.449
and swear that he was
his Christian godson.

01:20:53.574 --> 01:20:56.118
But survival carried
a heavy price tag.

01:20:56.243 --> 01:20:58.245
While hundreds of thousands
of Hungarian Jews

01:20:58.370 --> 01:21:00.706
were being shipped off
to the death camps,

01:21:00.831 --> 01:21:03.124
George Soros accompanied
his phony godfather

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:05.126
on his appointed rounds,

01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:07.670
confiscating property
from the Jews.

01:21:07.795 --> 01:21:09.672
I was 14 years old.

01:21:09.797 --> 01:21:12.383
And I would say that that's
when my character was made.

01:21:12.508 --> 01:21:14.260
- In what way?
- That one should think ahead,

01:21:14.385 --> 01:21:18.847
one should understand
and-and anticipate events.

01:21:26.104 --> 01:21:27.939
My understanding is,
is that you went out

01:21:28.064 --> 01:21:30.191
with this protector of yours

01:21:30.316 --> 01:21:32.818
who swore that you were,

01:21:32.943 --> 01:21:35.279
-uh, his adopted godson.
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:21:35.404 --> 01:21:38.490
Went out, in fact, and helped
in the confiscation of property

01:21:38.615 --> 01:21:40.075
-from the Jews.
- That's right.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.577
- Yes.
- KROFT: But that-that sounds,

01:21:42.702 --> 01:21:47.498
uh, like an experience
that would send lots of people

01:21:47.624 --> 01:21:50.877
to the psychiatric couch
for many, many years.

01:21:51.002 --> 01:21:52.211
<i>Was it difficult?</i>

01:21:52.336 --> 01:21:54.630
Uh... not...

01:21:54.755 --> 01:21:56.924
not at all, not at all.

01:21:57.049 --> 01:21:59.176
It created no...
no problem at all.

01:21:59.301 --> 01:22:00.844
- No...! feeling of guilt?
- No...!.

01:22:00.969 --> 01:22:04.389
Well, actually, in a funny way,
it's just like in markets,

01:22:04.514 --> 01:22:07.684
that if I weren't there--

01:22:07.809 --> 01:22:09.977
<i>of course, I wasn't doing it--</i>

01:22:10.102 --> 01:22:12.188
but somebody else
would-would...

01:22:12.313 --> 01:22:13.731
would be taking it away anyhow.

01:22:13.856 --> 01:22:16.066
And it was the...
whether I was there or not.

01:22:16.191 --> 01:22:17.693
I was only a spectator.

01:22:17.818 --> 01:22:19.444
The property
was being taken away.

01:22:19.569 --> 01:22:24.032
So I had no role
in taking away that property.

01:22:24.157 --> 01:22:26.034
So I had no sense of guilt.

01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:27.660
Are you religious?

01:22:27.785 --> 01:22:29.579
No...!.

01:22:29.704 --> 01:22:32.373
- Do you believe in God?
- No.

01:22:32.498 --> 01:22:36.377
D'SOUZA: The issue is not
what Soros did as a teenager.

01:22:36.502 --> 01:22:38.587
It is that today, as an adult,

01:22:38.712 --> 01:22:41.465
he sees nothing wrong
with What he did

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:45.301
and would seemingly be willing
to do it again.

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:50.139
Soros's self-justification
echoes an argument made by one

01:22:50.264 --> 01:22:52.600
of the most notorious
Nazis himself.

01:22:52.725 --> 01:22:54.602
"During my work
at the Gypsy camp,

01:22:54.727 --> 01:22:56.687
"I came across Mengele
and watched his activities.

01:22:56.812 --> 01:22:57.980
"I personally observed him

01:22:58.105 --> 01:23:00.023
"infecting Gypsy twins
with typhus

01:23:00.148 --> 01:23:02.108
"in order to observe
whether the twins

01:23:02.234 --> 01:23:04.611
"reacted differently
or in the same way.

01:23:04.736 --> 01:23:07.071
"Shortly after...
after they were in...

01:23:07.196 --> 01:23:09.699
had been infected,
they were gassed."

01:23:09.824 --> 01:23:12.952
Do you believe that your father
was responsible for this?

01:23:13.077 --> 01:23:17.873
Personally,
he did not assume he did it.

01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:19.875
He thought he is a member

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.045
of a concentration camp,
he's not responsible for it,

01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:26.714
because he did not...

01:23:26.839 --> 01:23:29.842
invent the concentration camp.

01:23:33.512 --> 01:23:35.389
D'SOUZA:
Enough big lies.

01:23:35.514 --> 01:23:38.850
It is time to tell the truth.

01:23:38.976 --> 01:23:42.896
The progressive Democrats
are the true racists.

01:23:43.021 --> 01:23:45.648
They are the true fascists.

01:23:47.191 --> 01:23:49.193
They want to steal our income,

01:23:49.318 --> 01:23:52.363
they want to steal
our earnings and our wealth

01:23:52.488 --> 01:23:55.532
and our freedom and our lives.

01:23:55.658 --> 01:23:58.202
They're trying to kill America

01:23:58.327 --> 01:24:00.912
by killing
the economic and political

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:03.164
and religious freedom
of Americans.

01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:06.626
My wife Debbie grew up
in Venezuela

01:24:06.751 --> 01:24:09.545
and has seen firsthand
a prosperous democratic country

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:13.591
give way to socialist tyranny.

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.134
There, a fascist regime

01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:18.387
is destroying the lives
of the Venezuelan people.

01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:22.724

D'SOUZA: How do we fight
the tyranny of the left?

01:27:10.503 --> 01:27:13.631
We, as citizens,
have to do our part,

01:27:13.756 --> 01:27:16.759
as some did
even in Nazi Germany.

01:27:17.843 --> 01:27:19.553
Like Lenin and Hitler,

01:27:19.678 --> 01:27:23.265
Sophie Scholl came here
to Schwabing to study.

01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:25.016
While attending university,

01:27:25.141 --> 01:27:27.894
she learned of the atrocities
of the Nazis.

01:27:28.019 --> 01:27:29.270
She saw them.

01:27:30.354 --> 01:27:32.314
As a devout Christian,

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.400
she rejected
Nazi indoctrination

01:27:34.525 --> 01:27:36.485
and joined the White Rose,

01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:40.614
a group of activists
horrified by German war crimes.

01:27:45.702 --> 01:27:47.453
She and her associates

01:27:47.578 --> 01:27:50.122
distributed pamphlets
using Bible verses

01:27:50.248 --> 01:27:52.917
and philosophical arguments
for resistance

01:27:53.042 --> 01:27:55.711
to National Socialism.

01:27:55.836 --> 01:27:57.754
She showed us
how one individual...

01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:58.880
Thank you.

01:27:59.006 --> 01:28:00.966
...can fight to save a nation.

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:08.139
Lights.

01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:25.738
It's okay.

01:28:33.746 --> 01:28:36.540
SCHOLL:
Therefore, every individual

01:28:36.665 --> 01:28:39.668
conscious
of his responsibility

01:28:39.793 --> 01:28:42.879
as a member of Christian
and Western civilization

01:28:43.004 --> 01:28:45.548
must defend himself

01:28:45.673 --> 01:28:48.926
as best he can
at this late hour.

01:28:49.051 --> 01:28:51.345
He must work against fascism

01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:55.057
and any similar system
of totalitarianism.

01:29:55.404 --> 01:29:57.322
Quick.
Before the class is over.

01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:09.750
Be safe.

01:32:28.711 --> 01:32:32.506
"Every word that comes
from Hitler's mouth is a lie.

01:32:35.467 --> 01:32:39.054
"When he says 'peace,'
he means 'war,'

01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:42.682
"and when he blasphemously uses
the name of the Almighty,

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:44.559
"he means the power of evil,

01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:46.811
"the fallen angel, Satan.

01:32:52.691 --> 01:32:57.196
His mouth is
the foul-smelling maw of hell."

01:33:06.079 --> 01:33:09.082
How dare you speak
against the Fuhrer!

01:33:13.752 --> 01:33:16.088
Somebody, after all...

01:33:16.213 --> 01:33:18.090
had to make a start.

01:33:18.215 --> 01:33:21.051
What we wrote and said

01:33:21.176 --> 01:33:24.763
-is also believed
by many others.

01:33:26.347 --> 01:33:28.766
They just don't dare
to express themselves

01:33:28.891 --> 01:33:30.518
as we did.

01:33:32.978 --> 01:33:36.732
Found guilty, you will be
put to death for this treason.

01:33:42.153 --> 01:33:44.489
Will it be Worth it?

01:33:48.201 --> 01:33:50.703
An end in terror

01:33:50.828 --> 01:33:53.956
is preferable
to a terror with no end.

01:34:16.477 --> 01:34:19.187
SCHOLL:
I will cling to the rope

01:34:19.313 --> 01:34:22.524
God has thrown to me
in Jesus Christ,

01:34:22.649 --> 01:34:26.027
even when my numb hands

01:34:26.152 --> 01:34:27.904
can no longer feel it.

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:41.833
Isn't it a riddle

01:34:41.958 --> 01:34:44.210
and awe-inspiring

01:34:44.335 --> 01:34:47.755
that everything
is so beautiful...

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.841
despite the horror?

01:34:51.842 --> 01:34:56.013
Lately, I have noticed
something grand and mysterious

01:34:56.138 --> 01:35:00.642
peering through my sheer joy
in all that is beautiful,

01:35:00.767 --> 01:35:03.812
a sense of its creator.

01:35:03.937 --> 01:35:06.856
Only man can truly be ugly,

01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:09.317
because he has the free will

01:35:09.442 --> 01:35:12.194
to estrange himself...

01:35:12.319 --> 01:35:14.863
from this song of praise.

01:35:23.496 --> 01:35:26.291
How can we expect fate

01:35:26.416 --> 01:35:30.002
to let a righteous cause
prevail

01:35:30.127 --> 01:35:32.254
when there is hardly anyone

01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:36.341
who will give himself up
undividedly

01:35:36.467 --> 01:35:38.719
to a righteous cause?

01:35:44.766 --> 01:35:48.019
Stand up
for what you believe in.

01:35:51.397 --> 01:35:54.817
Even if you are standing alone.

01:36:21.967 --> 01:36:24.386
D'SOUZA: She showed us
how one individual

01:36:24.511 --> 01:36:27.430
can fight to save a nation.

01:36:31.058 --> 01:36:35.938
How do we, as a nation,
fight leftist tyranny?

01:36:36.063 --> 01:36:37.606
Reagan knew how to fight.

01:36:37.731 --> 01:36:41.318
Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.

01:36:41.443 --> 01:36:43.194
Mr. Gorbachev,

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.321
tear down this wall.

01:36:47.115 --> 01:36:48.991
D'SOUZA:
And Reagan knew how to win.

01:36:49.117 --> 01:36:50.826
REAGAN: Fascism ever comes
to America, it'll come

01:36:50.993 --> 01:36:52.411
in the name of-of liberalism.

01:36:52.536 --> 01:36:55.247
And what is fascism?
Fascism is:

01:36:55.372 --> 01:36:57.207
private ownership,
private enterprise,

01:36:57.332 --> 01:36:59.710
but total government control
and regulation.

01:36:59.835 --> 01:37:02.003
Well, isn't this
the liberal philosophy?

01:37:02.128 --> 01:37:03.421
The conservative, so-called,

01:37:03.546 --> 01:37:05.465
is the one that says,
"Less government,

01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:08.092
"get off my back,
get out of my pocket,

01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:11.762
and let me have more control
of my own destiny."

01:37:11.887 --> 01:37:15.724
D'SOUZA: Trump is the inheritor
of the Reagan mantle.

01:37:15.849 --> 01:37:18.769
Do we have the desire
and the courage

01:37:18.894 --> 01:37:20.854
to preserve our civilization

01:37:20.979 --> 01:37:25.775
in the face of those who
would subvert and destroy it?

01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:27.902
D'SOUZA: The parties
haven't switched sides.

01:37:28.027 --> 01:37:32.365
The main issue separating them
is the same as in 1860.

01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:35.159
You toil and work
and earn bread,

01:37:35.284 --> 01:37:37.161
and I'll eat it.

01:37:37.286 --> 01:37:39.579
D'SOUZA: Lincoln exposed
the Democratic Party

01:37:39.705 --> 01:37:41.581
as the party of theft.

01:37:41.706 --> 01:37:45.043
Republicans, he said, stand
for the right of Americans

01:37:45.168 --> 01:37:47.587
to keep the fruits
of their labor.

01:37:47.712 --> 01:37:49.839
Well, that's what
Republicans stand for now.

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:52.091
That's what Trump
is fighting for.

01:37:52.216 --> 01:37:56.512
Democrats have gone from
one theft scheme to another.

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:59.389
You work,
and they take what you earn

01:37:59.514 --> 01:38:01.433
to keep themselves in power.

01:38:01.558 --> 01:38:05.687
<i>Democrats were the party
of tyranny and enslavement</i>

01:38:05.812 --> 01:38:07.397
in Lincoln 's time,

01:38:07.522 --> 01:38:11.233
<i>and they are the party
of tyranny and enslavement now.</i>

01:38:12.777 --> 01:38:14.987
GUELZO:
If Lee had been victorious

01:38:15.112 --> 01:38:17.614
at Gettysburg,
that would have brought down

01:38:17.739 --> 01:38:19.408
the entire administration.

01:38:19.533 --> 01:38:21.451
And what the future
beyond that would have been

01:38:21.576 --> 01:38:25.371
is almost unthinkable,
because then,

01:38:25.497 --> 01:38:27.081
where would there have been

01:38:27.206 --> 01:38:29.375
an American republic
to intervene

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:32.378
against German militarism
in World War I

01:38:32.503 --> 01:38:35.214
or, worse still,
the universal midnight

01:38:35.339 --> 01:38:37.216
of Nazism in World War ll?

01:38:37.341 --> 01:38:39.009
The consequences of Gettysburg,

01:38:39.134 --> 01:38:40.969
if they'd gone
in the other direction,

01:38:41.094 --> 01:38:42.804
are simply enough

01:38:42.929 --> 01:38:45.014
to make the flesh creep.

01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:47.016
D'SOUZA:
Lincoln was tough.

01:38:47.141 --> 01:38:49.602
He refused to give up
his electoral mandate.

01:38:49.727 --> 01:38:52.897
He insisted it belonged
to the American people.

01:38:53.022 --> 01:38:56.233
He united Republicans
behind that toughness.

01:38:56.358 --> 01:38:58.652
Trump has
Lincoln 's inner toughness,

01:38:58.777 --> 01:39:00.987
but he needs
the Republican Party

01:39:01.113 --> 01:39:02.906
to get behind him.

01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:04.741
Lincoln was the architect

01:39:04.866 --> 01:39:07.744
of a decent
American nationalism.

01:39:07.869 --> 01:39:11.038
Trump must follow
in Lincoln 's footsteps.

01:39:11.163 --> 01:39:14.583
In this way,
Trump can complete the task

01:39:14.708 --> 01:39:17.211
to which Lincoln
dedicated his life:

01:39:17.336 --> 01:39:19.504
shutting down,
once and for all,

01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:22.215
the Democratic plantation.

01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:26.094
A nation dies
when its people are not free.

01:39:26.219 --> 01:39:28.554
<i>It's our America.</i>

01:39:28.679 --> 01:39:31.432
Let's save it
for the second time.

01:39:31.557 --> 01:39:33.350
LINCOLN (dramatized):
It is rather for us

01:39:33.476 --> 01:39:37.146
to be here dedicated
to the great task before us--

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:39.273
that from these honored dead

01:39:39.398 --> 01:39:43.985
we take increased devotion to
the cause for which they gave

01:39:44.110 --> 01:39:47.947
the last full measure
of devotion,

01:39:48.072 --> 01:39:51.909
that we here highly resolve
that these dead

01:39:52.034 --> 01:39:54.870
shall not have died in vain,
