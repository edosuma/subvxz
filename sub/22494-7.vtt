All right, Jason! Yeah!

01:57.324 --> 01:59.158
Unh!

01:59.227 --> 02:00.526
Where does rain come from?

02:00.595 --> 02:02.795
It's God just pissing
on your dumbass head.

02:02.864 --> 02:05.231
What are you doing with my son?

02:05.266 --> 02:07.934
So, with housing starts the
lowest they've been since 2003,

02:07.969 --> 02:09.936
I thought the interest-only
loan was viable.

02:09.971 --> 02:13.239
I mean, did you know the financial
crisis of 2008 was caused by unregulated

02:13.308 --> 02:16.476
derivatives as much as housing...
Excuse me. Hello? Yeah.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.777
My eyes are up here.

02:17.812 --> 02:18.945
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

02:18.980 --> 02:20.046
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

02:20.081 --> 02:21.213
Yeah, yeah.

02:21.282 --> 02:25.417
Well, listen, what more can I say about
a guy who put "commander" in his name?

02:25.486 --> 02:26.785
Hey, we get it.

02:27.588 --> 02:30.456
No, but seriously, you're
a great Cobra Commander.

02:30.491 --> 02:32.759
You've always been there for
me, and I appreciate it.

02:36.031 --> 02:36.863
That was funny.

02:36.899 --> 02:38.766
Hey, thanks for coming out, everybody.

02:38.801 --> 02:41.402
Baroness, I promise I'll make
this quick so you can get back

02:41.437 --> 02:43.004
to sucking Destro's [bleep]

02:46.009 --> 02:49.010
I swear, if he wore that helmet on his
[bleep] she'd have lead poisoning.

02:49.045 --> 02:51.412
Am I right?

02:51.481 --> 02:54.315
Hey, Xamot, I hear you experience
everything Tomax does.

02:54.350 --> 02:57.484
I guess that means you know what
my [bleep] tastes like, too.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.219
I see you over there, Serpentor.

02:59.254 --> 03:01.487
Didn't Dr. Mindbender give you the memo?

03:01.523 --> 03:02.455
The hunt's over.

03:02.491 --> 03:04.357
You can stop gathering DNA.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.125
Arr! Arr! Arr!

03:06.193 --> 03:07.392
Nice outfit, by the way.

03:07.461 --> 03:11.196
If it were any louder, I'd have to
wear earplugs when you suck my [bleep]

03:11.232 --> 03:12.932
Gee, I wonder what he wanted to say.

03:12.967 --> 03:17.002
"I vant to bend your
mind into letting me suck your [bleep]"

03:17.838 --> 03:18.570
Don't worry.

03:18.605 --> 03:21.106
I haven't forgotten
about you, Cobra Commander.

03:21.175 --> 03:22.641
It <i>is</i> your night, after all.

03:22.643 --> 03:27.012
The ruthless terrorist organizer
determined to suck my [bleep]

03:27.081 --> 03:28.013
How dare you!

03:28.049 --> 03:29.548
Hey, is your voice okay?

03:29.584 --> 03:32.251
Let me get you something
for your throat.

03:32.286 --> 03:34.286
My [bleep]

03:34.321 --> 03:36.188
My [bleep]

03:38.458 --> 03:40.091
It's working.

03:40.127 --> 03:41.826
Wild Bill's disguise worked!

03:41.862 --> 03:43.895
We ruined Cobra Commander's roast!

03:43.930 --> 03:45.363
All right!

03:47.200 --> 03:48.900
Bill?

03:51.238 --> 03:52.438
Start the van.

03:52.473 --> 03:55.909
First division, cha-a-a-rge!

03:56.545 --> 03:57.010
General!

03:57.079 --> 03:57.444
Major!

03:57.513 --> 04:00.247
No! Outranked!

04:00.282 --> 04:00.814
Captain.

04:00.883 --> 04:01.448
Colonel.

04:01.484 --> 04:04.352
Nah!
Son of a... Ha ha ha!

04:04.421 --> 04:04.986
Sergeant!

04:05.021 --> 04:05.553
Sergeant!

04:05.588 --> 04:06.454
Damn it!

04:06.523 --> 04:07.955
Aw, come on!

04:07.991 --> 04:09.056
Ha ha! Major!

04:09.091 --> 04:09.456
Die!

04:09.492 --> 04:10.357
Oh, please!

04:10.426 --> 04:11.792
I'm... I'm just a scout!

04:15.864 --> 04:17.063
Captain!

04:17.099 --> 04:20.333
Surely, one bomb can't
detonate three t... Aah!

04:20.368 --> 04:23.803
Victory will be ours!

04:23.805 --> 04:23.936
Huh?

04:23.971 --> 04:25.504
H-hey, guys, I got it!

04:25.539 --> 04:26.705
I got their flag!

04:26.774 --> 04:28.073
We win!

04:28.141 --> 04:29.607
W-what?!

04:29.676 --> 04:30.442
You don't win!

04:30.510 --> 04:31.710
We're <i>creaming</i> you guys!

04:31.745 --> 04:33.712
I got your flag!

04:33.748 --> 04:35.147
That means we win!

04:35.216 --> 04:36.849
That's total crap!

04:36.885 --> 04:38.985
I used a <i>way</i> better strategy!

04:39.054 --> 04:42.055
But <i>I</i> used a better stratego.

04:43.726 --> 04:47.595
Baby needs a name,
your wish came true.

04:47.630 --> 04:49.130
You have a pet of your berry own.

04:49.165 --> 04:51.065
Yes, strawberry shortcake.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.799
But I have another wish.

04:52.868 --> 04:55.969
I want to have a name
of my very own, too.

04:56.038 --> 04:59.139
We should give you a name soon
and not leave it open to debate.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.775
Strawberry land is berry
sheltered, but it's big world

05:01.811 --> 05:04.778
out there, and others might have
berry different opinions about

05:04.847 --> 05:06.980
what constitutes an appropriate name.

05:07.049 --> 05:08.115
I'm not worried.

05:08.150 --> 05:10.952
Well, I'm just...

05:10.987 --> 05:11.519
Oh.

05:11.587 --> 05:13.520
Hello, bitch pudding.

05:13.589 --> 05:15.556
Whassup, hoes?

05:28.571 --> 05:29.237
Whew!

05:29.272 --> 05:34.675
Anyway, I'm sure that one day, someone
will give you a name... Blam!

05:34.677 --> 05:35.676
Your name is [Bleep] Face!

05:35.745 --> 05:37.111
You [bleep] [Bleep] Face!

05:37.146 --> 05:37.778
Blam!

05:37.814 --> 05:38.913
[Bleep] Face!

05:38.948 --> 05:39.547
Blam!

05:39.582 --> 05:40.748
[Bleep] Face!

05:40.784 --> 05:41.949
Blam, bitches!

05:42.018 --> 05:44.752
♪ Da-da-daaaa daaaa ♪

05:44.821 --> 05:46.321
Bitch pudding!

05:50.828 --> 05:52.094
I am so sorry.

05:52.129 --> 05:53.863
I think she has
Asperger's or something.

05:53.898 --> 05:55.931
But don't take it personally,
baby needs a name.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.499
No, no.

05:56.534 --> 05:58.634
Call me [Bleep] Face.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.102
Mommy, what are eggs?

06:00.137 --> 06:01.670
Baby chickens, sweetie.

06:01.739 --> 06:03.573
Do all babies come from eggs?

06:03.642 --> 06:04.674
Yes, they do.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.209
Did <i>I</i> come from an egg?

06:06.278 --> 06:07.644
You sure did, dear.

06:07.679 --> 06:10.747
Is the mama chicken sad that
we're eating her babies?

06:10.816 --> 06:11.915
God, I hope so.

06:11.950 --> 06:15.118
A chicken killed your father!

06:15.187 --> 06:17.287
Aaaah!

06:17.322 --> 06:20.391
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

06:20.460 --> 06:23.394
I'm trying to read!

06:30.736 --> 06:32.703
Ugh! A rock lord?!

06:32.738 --> 06:33.270
Seriously?!

06:33.305 --> 06:34.104
[Bleep] you both.

06:34.172 --> 06:37.340
You know, in some countries, little
boys are grateful for rock lords.

06:37.375 --> 06:39.342
Oh, yeah? What countries?

06:41.144 --> 06:42.377
Oh, a rock lord!

06:42.413 --> 06:43.612
Thank you, mother!

06:43.647 --> 06:44.813
Thank you, father!

06:44.848 --> 06:48.617
I am so very grateful to have
such thoughtful parents.

06:53.891 --> 06:54.924
Rock lords!

06:54.992 --> 06:56.626
They hurt like a [bleep]

06:57.729 --> 07:01.632
For my next feat, I will
walk across hot coals while

07:01.667 --> 07:03.734
explaining what the hell I am.

07:03.803 --> 07:04.435
No.

07:04.471 --> 07:06.705
For your next feat, you die!

07:06.740 --> 07:08.906
Aaah!

07:12.012 --> 07:16.714
Gonzo died as he lived, and our
family will never be whole again.

07:16.782 --> 07:19.616
And now, ladies and gentlemen, 
Mr. Steve Martin!

07:19.684 --> 07:21.250
Yaaay!

07:21.252 --> 07:23.353
I shall not want.

07:23.388 --> 07:24.821
He makes me lie down...
Ooh!

07:24.889 --> 07:26.222
Are we burying him in a Sybian?

07:27.025 --> 07:30.493
You know, the last time a
Muppet died was... Excuse me!

07:30.528 --> 07:35.499
Don't you mean...
"Excu-u-u-u-se me!"

07:35.534 --> 07:36.800
No! This is a funeral!

07:36.836 --> 07:37.534
I'm working!

07:37.570 --> 07:40.972
Do I come to where <i>you</i> work and
knock the [bleep] out of your mouth?

07:41.040 --> 07:42.540
Wow. Steve's working blue.

07:42.609 --> 07:43.508
But he's right.

07:43.543 --> 07:46.144
We vowed never to talk about...
That night.

07:50.084 --> 07:53.318
And then the dad says,
"The Aristocrats!"

07:53.353 --> 07:54.852
Wakka wakka!

07:54.888 --> 07:57.321
Hey, Fozzie, why did
the bear turn red?

07:57.356 --> 07:58.856
I don't know, stranger.

07:58.891 --> 08:01.525
Because he was "em-bear-rassed."

08:01.594 --> 08:03.494
Wakka, wakka.

08:03.529 --> 08:06.698
Then how about this... because
I [bleep] stabbed him!

08:06.766 --> 08:09.134
Waa-haa!

08:09.169 --> 08:10.435
What a showstopper.

08:11.171 --> 08:11.703
See?

08:11.772 --> 08:14.506
I told you the bear was
gonna die onstage tonight.

08:15.543 --> 08:19.378
Hey, guys... can you stop laughing
and call me an ambulance?

08:19.414 --> 08:20.780
You're an ambulance!

08:25.854 --> 08:27.153
First Gonzo, now Fozzie.

08:27.222 --> 08:31.124
- Could we be paying the price for what we
did to... - Don't say that name, Kermie!

08:31.193 --> 08:31.691
Oh!

08:31.726 --> 08:33.826
Miss Piggy's telling me what to do!

08:33.861 --> 08:35.594
Wow! Hey, everybody! Come here!

08:35.663 --> 08:37.096
You got to come see this!

08:37.131 --> 08:38.864
<i>Piggy's</i> telling <i>me</i> what to do!

08:38.933 --> 08:39.297
Wow!

08:39.332 --> 08:41.099
Must be a day that ends in "y"!

08:41.134 --> 08:43.034
Hey, uh, Scooter.
Oh, hey, there, boss.

08:43.070 --> 08:44.936
We need to talk about Skeeter's death.

08:44.972 --> 08:45.570
Why, sure.

08:45.639 --> 08:47.305
I love talking about my twin sister.

08:47.340 --> 08:50.909
If not for that tragic accident...
You know, I'm gonna stop you right there.

08:50.944 --> 08:52.477
I got something I got to tell you.

08:52.546 --> 08:54.212
Let's play "The Little Mermaid"!

08:54.281 --> 08:56.381
Let's question Kermit's sexuality!

08:56.416 --> 08:57.482
Wakka wakka!

08:57.551 --> 08:58.216
Holon.

08:58.251 --> 08:59.484
Let me grab my floaties.

08:59.519 --> 09:00.318
What a nerd.

09:01.455 --> 09:03.288
<i>Moi</i> will play <i>La Petite Mermaid.</i>

09:03.323 --> 09:04.489
<i>Mermaids aren't fat!</i>

09:04.525 --> 09:05.657
<i>Wha... Yikes!</i>

09:05.726 --> 09:08.493
<i>Skeeter, if you only take my
advice once in your natural</i>

09:08.529 --> 09:09.494
<i>life, take it now.</i>

09:09.563 --> 09:10.929
<i>Walk away.</i>

09:10.964 --> 09:11.563
<i>Ohh!</i>

09:11.598 --> 09:12.464
<i>Nanny!</i>

09:12.499 --> 09:14.732
<i>Skeeter's hitting us again!</i>

09:14.768 --> 09:16.734
<i>Yeah, who's the homo now?</i>

09:21.441 --> 09:23.641
<i>Unh!</i>

09:25.211 --> 09:29.180
<i>If we do this thing, it's
our secret forever.</i>

09:39.726 --> 09:41.893
<i>Nanny!</i>

09:41.928 --> 09:43.728
<i>You killed my sister?!</i>

09:43.764 --> 09:44.929
<i>Yeah, well, it was</i>

09:44.998 --> 09:47.565
60% self-defense, but we' kind
of burying the lead here.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.201
We think Skeeter's come back
from the grave for revenge!

09:50.236 --> 09:54.438
Oh, Skeeter will
<i>have</i> her revenge.

09:55.307 --> 09:57.740
Aaaah!

09:57.809 --> 09:59.909
15 seconds till your death!

09:59.944 --> 10:02.144
Hyah!

10:02.179 --> 10:05.280
Wha... Here it comes!
Showtime!

10:08.484 --> 10:09.717
You can't shoot me.

10:09.752 --> 10:11.686
Chickens don't even have fingers.

10:11.722 --> 10:13.255
