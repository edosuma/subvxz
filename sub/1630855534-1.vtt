[in Chinese] Professor Cheng,
head of Yutime Oil.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.958
[in Chinese] Hello, professor.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.375
[in Chinese]
Thank you for coming
to rescue us.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.041
[in Chinese]
Can you bring me up to speed?

03:17.041 --> 03:19.583
- [in Chinese] Of course, follow me.
- [in Chinese] HaiMing, unload.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.625
You two, follow me. Hurry up.

03:20.625 --> 03:21.541
[in Chinese] Yes, sir.

03:21.541 --> 03:24.375
[Cheng in Chinese] We are only
safe inside the refinery.

03:24.375 --> 03:27.083
[Luo in Chinese] Don't worry,
we're here to escort you out.

03:27.083 --> 03:30.000
Our planes are waiting for you
in the Green Zone.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.000
Do you know who the rebels are?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.166
[Cheng in Chinese]
I don't know.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.208
They want us to give
up the refinery.

03:35.708 --> 03:37.166
We've been surrounded
for two weeks.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.541
They launch an attack
every couple of days.

03:39.541 --> 03:41.833
We've increased our security

03:41.833 --> 03:43.875
but if they launch another
attack like yesterday,

03:43.875 --> 03:45.541
we won't make it.

03:45.541 --> 03:46.958
We must evacuate immediately.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.708
[in Chinese] How many
are we evacuating?

03:49.708 --> 03:52.000
[in Chinese] Four hundred
and ninety eight including the children.

03:53.791 --> 03:56.416
[Luo in Chinese] There's a lot
of things to do before we go.

03:56.416 --> 03:57.750
We plan to leave at dawn.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.458
Gets it all and
is happy with it.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.916
Looks happy, looks concerned.
He's concerned now.

04:07.708 --> 04:08.541
It's in the sand.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.458
[boy in Arabic] I made it.

04:15.958 --> 04:16.958
How's it going, Chris?

04:16.958 --> 04:18.375
You're late, Henry.

04:18.375 --> 04:19.833
Jesus, Chris.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.791
Here's your money, as promised.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.875
We go in and out. Nobody hurt.

04:30.375 --> 04:31.625
You're gonna count it?

04:31.625 --> 04:33.375
Hell yeah, I'm gonna count it.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.208
Listen, you're family
but you're a thief.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.041
Ah.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.958
Bald Eagle over there,
he doesn't care if I count it.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.583
Bit of a misread on me,
I think he does care if I count it.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.875
Or-or was it the nickname?

04:43.875 --> 04:44.958
You guys do nicknames?

04:46.416 --> 04:47.666
You guys don't do nicknames.

04:48.666 --> 04:51.500
Are you kidding me? Nicknames
are like the heart of team camaraderie.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.291
Huh, you guys are in luck,
nicknames are like my superpower.

04:54.291 --> 04:55.708
I've been giving 'em out
since peewee football.

04:55.708 --> 04:56.625
Yeah, bro,

04:56.625 --> 04:58.041
these guys are a
little bit on edge.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.291
I'm gonna take the edge off.

04:59.291 --> 05:00.041
Okay,
[clears throat]

05:00.041 --> 05:01.125
Bald Eagle,

05:01.125 --> 05:02.375
like the one from the Muppets.

05:02.916 --> 05:03.583
Toothpick.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.125
There's a double meaning.
You'll figure it out.

05:06.125 --> 05:06.958
Uh,

05:06.958 --> 05:08.833
Tomb Raider, because I just--

05:09.375 --> 05:11.500
I just feel like you'll haunt me
long after I'm dead.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.708
[tense score]

05:16.208 --> 05:17.708
[sighs]
Uh...

05:20.250 --> 05:21.916
Full disclosure,
there's a lot going on here, uh...

05:23.708 --> 05:24.791
I'm drawn to "Graffiti"

05:24.791 --> 05:27.166
'cause it looks like some
teenagers vandalized your face.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.000
That's not it.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.875
It's just a start for
me, but I got you.

05:30.875 --> 05:31.750
Bro,

05:32.333 --> 05:33.750
can you be serious
for one second?

05:34.625 --> 05:36.666
Have you given any more thought
to my plan?

05:36.666 --> 05:39.166
Like, one more mission,
five times the money?

05:39.875 --> 05:41.291
Can't do it.
I've already done way too much.

05:41.291 --> 05:44.166
You're telling me this place
couldn't use more money to fix
things up?

05:44.166 --> 05:45.083
Don't start.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.208
Yeah, well, it's a big job.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.458
- No.
- Moving target.

05:48.458 --> 05:49.166
No.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.875
And it's for Unicorp, bro.

05:50.875 --> 05:51.875
Not interested.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.833
You remember that rebel attack
on Area Seven, don't you?

05:55.708 --> 05:57.708
When five of our
guys got popped.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.708
This is the son of a
bitch who armed them.

06:02.708 --> 06:03.833
And right now

06:03.833 --> 06:06.583
a team of mercenaries
is escorting this dirtbag back
to China.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.916
You wanna take on the Chinese?

06:07.916 --> 06:09.916
No, no, no. It's
not the Chinese.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.833
It's an international
criminal, all right?

06:12.833 --> 06:14.958
She's being extracted
on the Highway of Death

06:14.958 --> 06:16.500
back to the Green Zone.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.708
[boy in Arabic]
Big Dog, come on.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.833
Stay there, I'll pick you up.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.375
Highway of Death?

06:23.541 --> 06:24.791
The most dangerous
road in the country.

06:24.791 --> 06:25.875
You know that.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.958
You're an idiot
for even thinking about it.

06:30.291 --> 06:31.708
Yeah, Dad would've
done it, though.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.791
[Chris sighs]

06:32.791 --> 06:33.875
[tense score]

06:38.166 --> 06:39.166

[truck engine starts]

06:50.541 --> 06:51.750

06:54.000 --> 06:55.625
Keep your eye on the ball, okay?

06:58.250 --> 06:59.291
Almost, almost.

06:59.291 --> 07:01.250
Now let's let it
rip. Hit the mitt.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.041
Whoa.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.083
- Fantastic.
- [car horn honking]

07:11.208 --> 07:12.791
You got it, Funhouse, come on.

07:14.833 --> 07:15.833
Hey, Soraya.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.125
Hello, Owen.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.333
You look beautiful today.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.500
What? No!

07:23.500 --> 07:26.625
I hope you don't mind me
saying, but that, um, abaya,

07:26.625 --> 07:29.000
it really makes
your, your skin glow.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.333
Owen, stop.

07:32.291 --> 07:33.333
Always working.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.833
No harder than you, my friend.

07:34.833 --> 07:35.916
[briefcase clatters]

07:37.208 --> 07:38.541
So what about the pipe?

07:40.458 --> 07:41.458
It's bone dry.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.416
And you're wasting your time.

07:43.416 --> 07:44.583
Pump's rusted.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.000
Pipe's disconnected.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.375

[goat bleating]

07:51.916 --> 07:52.708
[sighs]

07:54.166 --> 07:55.958
Damn, I hate this company.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.250
Well, I hate we
don't have water.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.333
Yeah.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.541
I mean, I have a little.

08:00.541 --> 08:03.000
I got buckets and charcoal,
so we bring a little at a time, but

08:04.208 --> 08:05.625
it's not enough.
I mean, they built that dam.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.000
- They cut this place off.
- [Owen sighs]

08:09.166 --> 08:11.541
If you want,
I can go talk to Unicorp headquarters

08:11.541 --> 08:13.458
but you know how that goes.

08:13.458 --> 08:14.875
You want us to
bribe 'em for water?

08:14.875 --> 08:17.416
There's only one thing
more expensive than oil.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.541
Water.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.000
The more desperate,
the more expensive.

08:22.000 --> 08:22.958
How much?

08:23.666 --> 08:25.000
[Owen sighs]

08:25.500 --> 08:26.958
Probably a 100 grand.

08:26.958 --> 08:28.041
[tender score]

08:30.125 --> 08:31.708
I'm sorry, I'm doing all I can.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.250
It's just that it--

08:41.666 --> 08:43.875
I'll get a crew together
if you guys can get the money.

08:44.958 --> 08:45.958
Okay.

08:46.833 --> 08:47.833
Do what you can.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.416
This place is gonna die
without water, man.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.208
[ominous score]

08:55.375 --> 08:56.750

we'll arrive at the Green Zone
in two groups.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.791
One at nine a.m., the
second at four p.m.

09:02.791 --> 09:03.958

English, please.

09:05.708 --> 09:06.875

09:12.833 --> 09:13.916

09:14.708 --> 09:17.166
Then we're still taking
the Highway of Death.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.500
It's the fastest way

09:19.041 --> 09:20.291

- [crickets chirping]
- [dog barking in distance]

09:42.458 --> 09:43.458
I'll think of something.

09:44.416 --> 09:45.250
Okay.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.250
[in Chinese] Got it.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.625

there's still another seat on

Excellent. Let's go.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.000
Commander Luo,

12:32.583 --> 12:34.833
the helicopters are pushing
ahead to the Green Zone.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.000
You're on your own now.

You can't stand the whole way.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.208
Road's bumpy, it's dangerous.

13:25.750 --> 13:26.875
[in Chinese] I'm fine.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.583
[in Chinese] More
stubborn than your mom.

13:35.708 --> 13:37.708

It looks so tragic.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.375
[in Chinese] A lot of people
died here during the war.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.875
It's still dangerous here.

14:13.541 --> 14:14.583
Don't worry, we'll be okay.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.500
Watch the sides.

14:17.916 --> 14:18.916
Prepare yourselves.

14:22.625 --> 14:23.625

[in Arabic] I can
see them coming!

15:06.166 --> 15:07.458
[in Chinese] I
know. Don't worry.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.208
Stay in formation. Be careful.

15:14.125 --> 15:15.416
[in Chinese] What
are you doing?

15:15.416 --> 15:16.833
[in Chinese] There's
no mines there.

You see?

16:03.666 --> 16:04.666
It's all a trap.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
They want to lure you in

16:07.916 --> 16:09.875
somewhere you think is safe
and take your life.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.333
Mei,

16:32.750 --> 16:35.000
I'm here to protect you.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.166
[in Chinese]
You are here to be a hero not
for me,

16:39.500 --> 16:40.541
but for them.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.958
[in Chinese]
Your name was on the evacuation list.

16:48.416 --> 16:49.250
[unbuckles seatbelt]

16:51.375 --> 16:52.375
[in Chinese] So,

16:53.291 --> 16:55.666
you brought your team
all the way here to save me

16:56.375 --> 16:57.500
just for my forgiveness?

16:58.041 --> 16:59.041
It's not gonna happen.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.208
You broke my mom's heart.

17:01.666 --> 17:02.708
And mine as well.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.125
I'll never forgive you.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.625
[in Chinese] It was your mom
who took you away from me.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.166
[in Chinese] That's just
because you never cared about us.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.333
My mom was lying
there in the hospital,

17:13.916 --> 17:15.666
she couldn't get out of bed

17:16.458 --> 17:19.250
but you never bothered to visit
her, not even once.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.666
How could you be so cruel?

17:26.666 --> 17:28.916
[in Chinese]
I was on a top secret mission.

17:28.916 --> 17:30.000
Our country needed me.

17:30.875 --> 17:31.833
[in Chinese] Our
country needed you?

17:32.625 --> 17:33.625
Right.

17:35.541 --> 17:36.375
What about me?

17:37.208 --> 17:38.750
I was so little.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.208
Mom was in the hospital,
she needed you more.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.583
But what have you done for us?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.250
As an engineer here,

18:00.291 --> 18:01.291
I'm grateful for you.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.375
But as your daughter,

18:05.166 --> 18:06.166
there's nothing left to say.

18:10.708 --> 18:12.250

QiXing,

18:29.500 --> 18:31.416
didn't you say the
weather was clear?

18:31.416 --> 18:33.333
[in Chinese]
I've been keeping an eye on the data.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.541
It shows
the chance of a sandstorm here
is zero.

18:35.541 --> 18:38.041
[Luo in Chinese] If we don't
keep going, we'll miss our window.

18:38.041 --> 18:39.583
Jing and Yan, close the hatches.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.750
We need to get through

19:32.000 --> 19:33.125
[Luo in Chinese] What?

19:35.125 --> 19:36.125
[in Chinese] Huh?

Nothing. I thought
I saw something.

I have surveyed this area

25:03.916 --> 25:05.583
the sandstorm was man-made.

25:06.583 --> 25:09.625

25:56.083 --> 25:58.083

doing?

- Yeah.
- We've been talking online.

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:10.500
I met him through an app called
Finder. I thought it was "find
her"
