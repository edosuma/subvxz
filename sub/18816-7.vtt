WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.839
Your father was poisoned.

00:01.890 --> 00:04.960
I would say heavy doses
over a short period.

00:05.010 --> 00:08.000
Brace, what's the matter?

00:08.050 --> 00:09.240
The truth.

00:09.290 --> 00:11.880
Those bastards
at the Palace have opened

00:11.930 --> 00:15.080
a Royal Commission into
the sinking of the Influence.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.720
You are now one of us.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.640
You'll risk the life of your son?

00:18.690 --> 00:19.730
Zilpha.

00:21.330 --> 00:22.640
What have you done?

00:22.690 --> 00:23.890
I killed him.

00:28.730 --> 00:31.240
James, this powder is
not ready to be moved

00:31.290 --> 00:32.800
because it is unstable.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.120
We are leaving
because we have been betrayed.

00:35.170 --> 00:37.650
Sir Stuart just wants
you to know... it's war.

00:40.930 --> 00:42.290
The gloves are off.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.800
James, what are you doing?

00:45.850 --> 00:48.530
Go away.
I'm not fit to be near you now.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.280
Dear Lord, we are gathered
in your presence here today

02:06.330 --> 02:10.690
on this most sorrowful occasion
to say farewell to Winter.

02:17.410 --> 02:20.840
Cured of her love of the world,

02:20.890 --> 02:23.960
untouched, pure,

02:24.010 --> 02:25.170
commended to God...

02:26.490 --> 02:30.600
she will not be covered in earth
as corrupted flesh,

02:30.650 --> 02:34.290
but instead will be sent to you,
O Lord...

02:35.890 --> 02:37.410
aboard a sunrise...

02:39.210 --> 02:40.920
Helga, I can't read the next word.

02:40.970 --> 02:43.960
...sent to you aboard a sunrise
along the road of the river

02:44.010 --> 02:46.410
that she loved,
as if it were her father.

02:48.050 --> 02:51.530
...along the road of the river she
loved, as if it were her father.

02:55.060 --> 02:57.560
_

03:06.050 --> 03:08.320
What's this?

03:08.370 --> 03:10.010
A package for Mr. Delaney.

03:11.210 --> 03:13.640
I believe this one
is a ward of your master,

03:13.690 --> 03:15.440
who asked me specifically

03:15.490 --> 03:19.840
to deliver him in person
to this house today.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.400
He's not in.

03:21.450 --> 03:23.360
What a surprise.

03:23.410 --> 03:24.730
Mr. Cholmondeley?

03:25.890 --> 03:27.480
Miss Bow.

03:27.530 --> 03:28.720
What's going on?

03:28.770 --> 03:30.680
A bastard.

03:30.730 --> 03:34.080
I thought, in all your charity,
you might extend some sustenance

03:34.130 --> 03:36.810
and some shelter
to this poor, unfortunate boy.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.450
What's your name?

03:41.010 --> 03:42.250
Robert. It's Robert.

03:43.770 --> 03:45.160
You know James Delaney, do you?

03:45.210 --> 03:46.250
Yes.

03:47.450 --> 03:49.520
Come into the house,
we'll find you something to eat

03:49.570 --> 03:51.120
and somewhere to sleep.

03:51.170 --> 03:52.570
Thank you.

03:58.850 --> 04:03.560
Take into your loving arms
this purest flake of snow,

04:03.610 --> 04:05.440
my daughter,

04:05.490 --> 04:07.530
my light, my love...

04:08.850 --> 04:09.930
my Winter.

04:13.490 --> 04:15.040
I thought I might find you here.

04:15.090 --> 04:19.529
A gentle soul,
taken from us all too soon.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.450
You've a heart, at least.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.050
I'm just looking for a ship.

04:28.090 --> 04:30.010
Watching what comes and goes.

04:32.290 --> 04:35.770
Raise her up to your heavens
and set her free by your light.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.320
Amen.

04:38.370 --> 04:39.480
Amen.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.090
I know you didn't do it.

04:43.010 --> 04:44.610
And how would you know that?

04:47.690 --> 04:48.730
Hmm?

04:50.170 --> 04:53.970
- I very well may have.
- Mm. You might have done.

04:56.290 --> 04:58.360
But I do know you cared for her.

04:58.410 --> 05:00.450
You were kind to her. She told me.

05:15.570 --> 05:17.090
The boy Robert's arrived.

05:46.850 --> 05:48.130
Oh!

05:49.290 --> 05:50.530
You OK?

05:52.810 --> 05:53.850
Hello.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.450
Did you know Winter?
Was she your friend?

05:59.730 --> 06:02.010
No. No, no, no! No, wait!

06:18.690 --> 06:22.520
Do you think that
this will be enough to sink her?

06:22.570 --> 06:26.040
I've committed many bodies
to the deep in this way.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.810
None have returned to London.

06:34.930 --> 06:36.330
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.200
You will find a place
where the current will take her

06:40.250 --> 06:41.290
to the wide ocean.

06:43.330 --> 06:44.930
It's where she wanted to be.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.890
The river will only take her body.

06:49.530 --> 06:50.690
I will keep her soul.

06:55.410 --> 06:58.370
There's no certainty
it was James that did it.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.930
There's no certainty that he did not.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.610
<i>I'm getting scared, James.</i>

07:15.170 --> 07:16.650
<i>Too many bodies in the river.</i>

07:19.690 --> 07:21.840
<i>Can I sleep under your house tonight?</i>

07:21.890 --> 07:25.170
<i>No. Go away,
I'm not fit to be near you now.</i>

07:27.290 --> 07:28.610
James!

07:33.690 --> 07:35.690
You're among them now, aren't you?

07:38.570 --> 07:40.530
The ones who used to sing to me.

07:45.610 --> 07:46.650
Hm.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.090
Was it my hand...?

08:12.610 --> 08:13.800
Brace!

08:15.730 --> 08:17.170
God's sake.

08:34.130 --> 08:37.169
I received a message
that you wished to speak with me.

08:43.450 --> 08:46.170
After you have eluded me so long.

08:56.890 --> 08:58.280
May I sit?

08:58.330 --> 08:59.370
Mm-hm.

09:00.530 --> 09:03.680
I need to know why you're seeking me?

09:03.730 --> 09:08.530
First, I must tell you that I
already know many things about you.

09:10.130 --> 09:13.120
I need to be clear that you're
not a spirit, like the others.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.680
No.

09:14.730 --> 09:15.930
I'm a rationalist.

09:19.970 --> 09:23.680
I'm carrying out an investigation
as part of a Royal Commission.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.120
I heard that you don't drink,

09:26.170 --> 09:29.160
that you don't fuck whores and, erm...

09:29.210 --> 09:32.520
that you're squeezing Sir Stuart
Strange on behalf of the King.

09:32.570 --> 09:34.960
- On behalf of justice.
- Oh, justice.

09:35.010 --> 09:36.290
Hello.

09:37.850 --> 09:39.360
You believe in justice?

09:39.410 --> 09:41.520
I do.

09:41.570 --> 09:43.290
And yet you're a rationalist.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.090
What kind of rational man
believes in justice?

09:51.450 --> 09:55.040
I'm investigating the sinking
of a sloop called the Cornwallis,

09:55.090 --> 09:59.890
renamed the Influence, off
the coast of Cabinda in July 1804.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.040
Mr. Delaney...

10:05.090 --> 10:08.160
I have strong reason to believe
that you were aboard the ship

10:08.210 --> 10:09.530
the night it sank.

10:21.010 --> 10:26.160
An example of the kind of nail
you used to nail down the hold of

10:26.210 --> 10:29.080
the East India Company ship,
the Cornwallis,

10:29.130 --> 10:30.690
when she ran aground...

10:32.450 --> 10:34.890
in July 1804.

10:38.650 --> 10:39.690
Hm.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.880
"Aye, aye, Captain," I said.

10:47.930 --> 10:49.920
I'm aware you were following orders.

10:49.970 --> 10:52.570
No, I happen to like driving in nails.

10:54.850 --> 10:57.120
Takes your mind off the rain

10:57.170 --> 10:58.770
and off of a sinking ship.

11:03.210 --> 11:05.440
Mr. Delaney, perhaps I should
come back during daytime.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.720
Oh, no, no, there's no use.
I am always like this.

11:07.770 --> 11:09.370
Please, carry on.

11:11.330 --> 11:15.520
You travelled to the Volta as a slave

11:15.570 --> 11:18.400
and then began to deal slaves.

11:18.450 --> 11:22.360
You stole diamonds
from a fellow slaver

11:22.410 --> 11:24.120
and then returned to London.

11:24.170 --> 11:27.770
I have done much worse things than...

11:29.570 --> 11:31.130
stealing diamonds.

11:32.210 --> 11:33.600
Yes.

11:33.650 --> 11:34.810
I know this, too.

11:36.370 --> 11:37.410
Ah.

11:43.610 --> 11:44.650
What do you want?

11:50.850 --> 11:52.450
As far as I can ascertain...

11:53.770 --> 11:58.010
you are the only surviving member
of the crew of the Cornwallis.

12:00.290 --> 12:05.640
I want you to write an account,
naming Sir Stuart Strange

12:05.690 --> 12:10.320
as the man who organised the loading
of the Cornwallis with slaves...

12:10.370 --> 12:13.920
bound for a sugar plantation
in Jumby Bay, Antigua...

12:13.970 --> 12:15.610
owned by his own brother.

12:18.810 --> 12:22.000
In return,
the Royal Commission will offer you

12:22.050 --> 12:24.770
a full pardon for your crime.

12:28.450 --> 12:30.530
For crime... it is.

12:35.970 --> 12:38.130
I have an alternative suggestion.

13:08.010 --> 13:09.050
In.

13:33.050 --> 13:34.570
Ah-ha.

13:44.330 --> 13:45.610
I have a use for you.

14:10.570 --> 14:11.770
For the safe.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.210
Mm-hm?

14:21.730 --> 14:22.970
Go.

14:40.890 --> 14:42.330
Murderer!

15:03.330 --> 15:04.570
Murderer!

16:19.850 --> 16:21.570
Do you know who blew up your ship?

16:44.050 --> 16:48.490
I've been thinking
a lot about what happened, and...

16:51.570 --> 16:53.130
and I think we were right.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.250
There wasn't the time for such...

17:04.490 --> 17:06.040
And we have plenty of time.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.130
No.

17:09.290 --> 17:10.810
No, we don't.

17:15.490 --> 17:18.290
When you first came back,
you told me you loved me.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.400
- I would never have thought...
- But you don't think.

17:25.450 --> 17:26.849
Do you?

17:27.849 --> 17:29.050
I know you.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.880
I know your nature.

17:31.930 --> 17:33.050
I know you. No.

17:37.130 --> 17:39.690
I believed once
that we were the same person.

17:42.730 --> 17:44.050
We are.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.000
We are not. We are.

17:47.050 --> 17:48.170
Not any more.

17:50.890 --> 17:51.930
Hm.

17:53.010 --> 17:55.360
Perhaps you should thank your God
for that.

17:55.410 --> 17:56.810
No.

17:58.850 --> 18:00.290
No, James.

18:01.410 --> 18:02.840
No.

18:02.890 --> 18:04.370
No, you can't do this.

18:06.970 --> 18:08.090
Not now.

18:11.530 --> 18:13.130
It is done. Please...

18:21.210 --> 18:23.200
For your widowhood.

18:28.090 --> 18:30.040
Now...

18:30.090 --> 18:32.650
I have work to do,
so please excuse me.

18:57.290 --> 19:00.090
- No fires within these walls.
- I'm sorry.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.650
We're not moving the powder today,
are we?

19:17.850 --> 19:20.160
So what's so urgent
I had to dismount from

19:20.210 --> 19:21.610
a porky little Chinese?

19:29.890 --> 19:31.810
This is where they kept my mother.

19:36.570 --> 19:37.610
Hmm.

19:42.290 --> 19:43.890
Something for your book.

19:46.090 --> 19:49.040
The lioness will
fiercely protect her cubs,

19:49.090 --> 19:51.010
regardless of the consequences.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.690
Even if that means her certain death.

19:59.770 --> 20:01.560
Helga.

20:01.610 --> 20:02.770
Is that who you mean?

20:04.050 --> 20:06.800
That woman will betray us.

20:06.850 --> 20:09.640
She knows about the division
with the Americans.

20:09.690 --> 20:11.360
That's high treason!

20:11.410 --> 20:14.920
That's you, me and my lot
feeding the ravens of London

20:14.970 --> 20:16.040
for at least a month.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.890
You will not harm her.

20:20.330 --> 20:22.130
She is harmed enough already.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.850
Well, she'll go to the Company.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.730
Yes.

20:36.850 --> 20:38.610
It is inevitable.

20:39.690 --> 20:40.730
Hmm?

20:46.610 --> 20:48.440
Fix the roof.

20:48.490 --> 20:50.290
Gunpowder and water don't mix.

21:04.690 --> 21:05.850
Where's Brace?

21:07.410 --> 21:08.760
In his room.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.770
He's been there all day,
either mad or sick or drunk.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.880
We knocked.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.010
He won't answer.

21:25.130 --> 21:29.450
Brace, you are not sick
and you are not dead yet.

21:30.490 --> 21:34.130
Come out, or I will come in there
and drag you out.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.010
Talk to me about the rats.

22:04.970 --> 22:06.480
Every house has rats.

22:06.530 --> 22:07.840
Hmm.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.890
But after you bought
so much arsenic...

22:12.730 --> 22:14.850
from the apothecary in Rotherhithe...

22:16.850 --> 22:18.290
Pinch after pinch...

22:19.810 --> 22:20.850
after pinch.

22:23.170 --> 22:24.770
It's a great deal of poison.

22:29.570 --> 22:30.770
Still, we have rats.

22:39.450 --> 22:40.490
What's that?

22:42.890 --> 22:44.410
Your father's buttons...

22:45.850 --> 22:47.010
from his dress coat.

22:49.490 --> 22:50.530
I kept them.

22:55.090 --> 22:56.330
It was a kindness.

23:01.410 --> 23:02.450
For who?

23:04.010 --> 23:06.080
We couldn't go on, James.

23:06.130 --> 23:08.080
But you did.

23:08.130 --> 23:10.650
You were dead.
Everyone was at his throat.

23:12.210 --> 23:14.410
He was burning his own flesh!

23:15.530 --> 23:16.850
He had no need to go on.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.690
Nothing left to live for.

23:21.450 --> 23:22.490
Hm.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.610
So you did him a kindness.

23:30.730 --> 23:32.130
I put an end to his pain.

23:37.890 --> 23:38.970
You did him...

23:40.250 --> 23:41.680
a kindness.

23:41.730 --> 23:42.770
I killed him!

23:46.370 --> 23:48.130
You came back too late!

23:49.490 --> 23:50.850
For both of us.

24:01.010 --> 24:03.210
You are wanted urgently downstairs.

24:04.770 --> 24:07.240
Mrs. Delaney is destroying
the kitchen.

24:07.290 --> 24:08.890
She's about to ruin a duck.

24:17.530 --> 24:20.560
Your ten o'clock
is 20 minutes early, sir.

24:20.610 --> 24:22.520
Oh, good.

24:22.570 --> 24:26.120
Then my 12 o'clock can be my 11.30,
my one o'clock can be my 12,

24:26.170 --> 24:30.010
and before you know it, the day
will be over before it's begun.

24:31.490 --> 24:32.680
Send him in.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.560
It's a woman, sir.

24:34.610 --> 24:36.370
Actually, two women, sir.

24:40.490 --> 24:42.360
Let me get this clear.

24:42.410 --> 24:47.200
You were witness to the division
of gunpowder and you heard,

24:47.250 --> 24:52.360
with your own ears, that a
proportion of this said powder

24:52.410 --> 24:57.520
was to be sold to a citizen
of the United States of America?

24:57.570 --> 24:59.760
Not sold, but given.

24:59.810 --> 25:02.930
On direct instruction
of James Delaney himself, sir.

25:05.450 --> 25:07.210
And you witnessed this, too?

25:12.090 --> 25:14.480
- She will have to say it, sir.
- Yes, yes.

25:14.530 --> 25:15.640
Ssh.

25:15.690 --> 25:17.520
You'll have to say it out loud.

25:17.570 --> 25:20.240
You witnessed
the division of the gunpowder

25:20.290 --> 25:22.530
and you heard its destination.

25:24.770 --> 25:26.010
Yes, I did, sir.

25:27.810 --> 25:32.320
And you were both being paid
for your services

25:32.370 --> 25:35.090
by James Keziah Delaney himself?

25:36.130 --> 25:37.450
In gold.

25:39.570 --> 25:41.360
And silver.

25:41.410 --> 25:43.240
And you're a British citizen?

25:43.290 --> 25:45.690
German by birth, British by marriage.

25:47.010 --> 25:48.400
And you?

25:48.450 --> 25:50.040
I'm from Dulwich, sir.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.680
Dulwich?

25:51.730 --> 25:53.330
Very good.

25:59.610 --> 26:03.240
Gentlemen, we have two witnesses
willing to testify that

26:03.290 --> 26:07.000
Delaney gave gunpowder
to an enemy of the Crown

26:07.050 --> 26:09.570
within the confines
of the City of London...

26:10.610 --> 26:14.130
compassing the death
of His Majesty the King.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.520
Well, it's...

26:19.570 --> 26:20.610
treason.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.370
High treason.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.450
We have him.

26:29.090 --> 26:31.330
We fucking have him!

26:32.410 --> 26:34.880
We have Delaney, we have Nootka,

26:34.930 --> 26:36.960
we have the China trade.

26:37.010 --> 26:39.560
We have opium, tea and powder.

26:39.610 --> 26:41.570
He'll be cut to pieces.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.920
A piece each, gentlemen.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.280
Gentlemen.

26:47.330 --> 26:48.680
Sir?

26:48.730 --> 26:49.850
Can we go now?

26:50.970 --> 26:52.240
Go?

26:54.090 --> 26:56.080
No, no, no, no.

26:56.130 --> 26:59.370
You are far, far too precious
to go anywhere.

27:00.690 --> 27:04.800
And as accessories for a crime
against the Crown,

27:04.850 --> 27:06.960
there will be due process.

27:07.010 --> 27:08.520
Take them.

27:08.570 --> 27:11.240
You'll be held in a secure place
until your pardon

27:11.290 --> 27:14.520
can be exchanged
for your testimony in court.

27:14.570 --> 27:15.920
What?

27:15.970 --> 27:17.480
Ugh! Get off me!

27:17.530 --> 27:19.050
Don't hurt them! Get off me!

27:36.850 --> 27:37.890
Where is he?

27:39.970 --> 27:41.640
They would not be denied, sir.

27:41.690 --> 27:43.240
This is the Prince's house.

27:43.290 --> 27:45.640
You should have dragged them out
on their arses.

27:45.690 --> 27:47.840
Stuart Strange is a Knight of
the Realm, I could not lay

27:47.890 --> 27:50.210
- a hand on him.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.130
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

28:00.210 --> 28:02.640
We have some rather good news...

28:02.690 --> 28:05.330
for British patriots everywhere.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.280
James!

28:58.410 --> 29:00.610
James! You are betrayed!

29:04.810 --> 29:07.090
Two women came to Leadenhall...

29:10.570 --> 29:11.970
I know.

29:14.690 --> 29:17.280
Where are they now?

29:17.330 --> 29:18.760
A safe house.

29:18.810 --> 29:20.530
I have the address.

29:23.650 --> 29:25.170
I have a use for you.

29:28.610 --> 29:31.050
There's someone I need you to see.

29:35.410 --> 29:38.840
"In the event of a conviction
for high treason,

29:38.890 --> 29:42.400
compassing the death
of our Lord the King,

29:42.450 --> 29:46.360
then the law of 'Corruption of Blood'

29:46.410 --> 29:49.440
will take precedence over all other.

29:49.490 --> 29:53.640
All land, property, chattels
and investments of the guilty party

29:53.690 --> 29:58.080
will pass without hindrance
to the Crown.

29:58.130 --> 30:02.160
And by dint of 'Corruption of Blood',

30:02.210 --> 30:05.720
all family members of the guilty party

30:05.770 --> 30:08.280
will be deemed corrupted

30:08.330 --> 30:14.050
and any claim to land, property,
chattels or investment...

30:15.610 --> 30:17.410
will be null and void."

30:20.730 --> 30:24.400
So... you've not only
delivered us Delaney,

30:24.450 --> 30:28.480
it appears you've delivered
Nootka Sound to the King.

30:28.530 --> 30:30.370
Hm.

30:31.490 --> 30:32.810
Why?

30:34.890 --> 30:38.000
Well, as loyal subjects of the Crown,

30:38.050 --> 30:39.600
we feel it is our duty

30:39.650 --> 30:43.410
to expose disloyalty and treason
in time of war.

30:45.490 --> 30:47.370
- However...
- Go on.

30:49.490 --> 30:54.240
...the ladies who are to give
the crucial evidence

30:54.290 --> 30:57.720
against James Delaney
are now in the protective custody

30:57.770 --> 31:00.280
of the East India Company.

31:00.330 --> 31:01.870
Their whereabouts are...

31:01.920 --> 31:06.680
known to just a handful
of trusted directors

31:06.730 --> 31:11.640
so, to ensure their safe delivery,

31:11.690 --> 31:17.290
we humbly suggest
you assign a monopoly.

31:19.650 --> 31:23.600
The trade in sea otter pelts for tea

31:23.650 --> 31:26.600
between Nootka and China.

31:26.650 --> 31:29.810
In favour of the loyal and...

31:31.210 --> 31:33.730
honourable East India Company.

31:36.130 --> 31:37.690
The King gets the land.

31:39.530 --> 31:41.650
You get the tea trade.

31:48.410 --> 31:50.450
You got lucky with a whore, Stuart.

31:52.170 --> 31:54.520
Well, there was an element of fortune.

31:54.570 --> 31:57.360
And an element of God's grace.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.450
And an element of strategy.

32:02.090 --> 32:03.130
Hm.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.920
So get to it.

32:06.970 --> 32:08.840
Arrest the bastard.

32:08.890 --> 32:10.440
Thank you, madam.

32:48.690 --> 32:52.560
Mr. Chichester, this is the man
I told you about...

32:52.610 --> 32:54.400
Michael Godfrey.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.050
George Chichester.

32:57.130 --> 32:59.000
Goodness, your hand is cold.

32:59.050 --> 33:01.160
I have been on the heath.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.240
I'm not sure
I can go through with this.

33:03.290 --> 33:05.850
Let us at least sit and talk.

33:10.890 --> 33:13.520
You lead a very interesting life.

33:13.570 --> 33:16.360
James, if he is religious
and scornful...

33:16.410 --> 33:19.480
I am scornful of those who judge.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.160
I myself am only concerned
with men's minds...

33:22.210 --> 33:24.450
clothes are of no interest to me.

33:26.890 --> 33:29.000
We can talk with purpose or without.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.290
Godders, no gin.

33:39.170 --> 33:42.960
Your account of the sinking of
the Cornwallis changes everything.

33:43.010 --> 33:46.440
Is there no world in which I could
offer my account anonymously?

33:46.490 --> 33:49.770
A Royal Commission cannot accept
anonymous testimony.

33:50.970 --> 33:53.500
I would be reporting things
said from a raised hand...

33:53.550 --> 33:54.790
Yes.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.690
...by the most senior directors
of the East India Company.

33:59.010 --> 34:00.490
Yes.

34:04.770 --> 34:07.560
How long have you worked
for the East India Company?

34:07.610 --> 34:09.760
I have only been clerk for 12 years.

34:09.810 --> 34:12.080
I have no idea how many years
it was going on for...

34:12.130 --> 34:15.239
No, but you were present
during the meeting when Sir Stuart

34:15.290 --> 34:18.320
concealed the facts about
the sinking of the Cornwallis.

34:18.370 --> 34:20.290
Would you agree to testify?

34:22.610 --> 34:27.170
Mr. Chichester, would you please
allow me a few moments alone?

34:48.810 --> 34:53.840
Now, listen here, Godders,
I'm going to sail away, all right?

34:53.889 --> 34:57.400
And all of those who have use to me
will sail along with me.

34:57.450 --> 34:59.040
And on my ship,

34:59.090 --> 35:01.280
there will be no rules
and there will be no judgment.

35:01.330 --> 35:04.680
We're sailing to a new world
and that is the plan.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.800
James...

35:06.850 --> 35:09.680
you are a fool.

35:09.730 --> 35:12.360
They are going to hang you.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.320
No.

35:14.370 --> 35:17.560
No, their case will flounder.
They can't.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.920
And we can make this happen.

35:19.970 --> 35:21.760
You and me.

35:21.810 --> 35:23.490
And the best of it...

35:24.930 --> 35:27.960
you will never have to testify.

35:28.010 --> 35:30.690
My ship will sail long before
the commission even sits.

35:33.130 --> 35:38.680
All you have to do is make-believe...

35:38.730 --> 35:40.490
to this man here.

35:41.730 --> 35:43.010
All right?

35:44.650 --> 35:46.690
Now, you can do that, can't you?

35:48.250 --> 35:50.370
Right. Right.

35:55.490 --> 35:57.120
Hm.

35:57.170 --> 36:01.680
We're good. Mr. Godfrey has decided
he will do the honourable thing.

36:01.730 --> 36:04.970
Your testimony will be with you
within the week.

36:06.050 --> 36:07.200
Signed?

36:07.250 --> 36:09.080
And sealed.

36:09.130 --> 36:12.000
And if required,
he will stand up in court?

36:12.050 --> 36:14.760
Let the good Lord be my witness...

36:14.810 --> 36:19.210
I will yell out the truth
to the four winds.

36:24.290 --> 36:29.050
Until that happy resolution,
I bid you good day, gentlemen.

36:35.850 --> 36:37.810
Mount up! To the Molly House!

36:42.490 --> 36:44.800
I cannot pack up my entire life
in five minutes.

36:44.850 --> 36:47.240
Well, you can pack it up
or you can lose it.

36:47.290 --> 36:50.400
This is ridiculous. What about you?

36:50.450 --> 36:52.010
I'm being followed.

36:53.450 --> 36:56.720
The Crown have soldiers searching
for me everywhere, so it ends here.

36:56.770 --> 36:58.080
Here? Yes.

36:58.130 --> 36:59.440
When?

36:59.490 --> 37:01.810
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ!

37:05.730 --> 37:07.200
Are you just going to sit?!

37:07.250 --> 37:09.880
Well, what's the use in hiding?
I need a ship and passage.

37:09.930 --> 37:12.720
James, they're not going to give you
a ship, they're going to hang you!

37:12.770 --> 37:14.400
No, no, no. Look...

37:14.450 --> 37:16.160
go to this address, all right?

37:16.210 --> 37:18.680
There will be a man with markings
on his face to meet you...

37:18.730 --> 37:20.680
he will take you to my friend Atticus.

37:20.730 --> 37:23.440
Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.

37:23.490 --> 37:26.720
Write your account...
he will secure it and keep you safe.

37:26.770 --> 37:29.320
Safe? Safe?

37:29.370 --> 37:32.720
When my ship is ready,
I will send for you.

37:32.770 --> 37:34.280
James, for God's sake,

37:34.330 --> 37:36.250
you don't have a bloody ship!

37:38.610 --> 37:39.810
No.

37:41.930 --> 37:43.050
Not yet.

37:51.010 --> 37:54.040
Right, ladies,
you might want to leave this place.

37:54.090 --> 37:55.720
There are soldiers coming.

37:55.770 --> 37:58.360
Soldiers? Then surely we should stay!

38:04.210 --> 38:05.680
You're almost out of wine!

38:05.730 --> 38:07.400
I know! That wine's gone to my head!

38:09.050 --> 38:10.530
Oh, here he comes.

38:13.410 --> 38:15.440
Who said that?

38:15.490 --> 38:16.850
Me.

38:20.130 --> 38:21.610
Right.

38:24.770 --> 38:29.600
I suggest that you leave
very quickly...

38:29.650 --> 38:32.170
and very, very quietly...

38:33.810 --> 38:36.000
or you can stay...

38:36.050 --> 38:39.690
for the extreme violence
that is coming your way.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.690
- Your choice.
- Come on, ladies.

38:51.810 --> 38:53.010
Hm.

38:57.050 --> 38:58.290
Go!

39:00.210 --> 39:02.240
He must be taken alive...

39:02.290 --> 39:05.770
by order of His Majesty King George!

39:09.490 --> 39:10.890
In here, Captain!

39:15.290 --> 39:17.240
James Keziah Delaney,

39:17.290 --> 39:20.200
you are hereby charged
with high treason,

39:20.250 --> 39:23.410
compassing the death
of our Lord the King!

39:27.930 --> 39:30.000
Dr. Dumbarton!

39:30.050 --> 39:32.320
Dr. Dumbarton!

39:32.370 --> 39:34.560
A merchant has been arrested
for high treason.

39:34.610 --> 39:37.440
In league with Americans...
you must clear out.

39:37.490 --> 39:40.720
When my reds are red
and my whites are white

39:40.770 --> 39:44.530
and my blues are blue,
then I will clear out.

40:19.450 --> 40:20.560
All right.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.050
You bastard!

40:28.490 --> 40:30.040
You traitor!

40:41.050 --> 40:42.370
Get up!

41:17.730 --> 41:20.560
- Where's Temple?
- He's not coming!

41:20.610 --> 41:22.640
Don't he want his share?

41:22.690 --> 41:25.410
- Hurry up, Temple!
- Come on, Temple!

41:34.250 --> 41:38.130
Hello. I've been looking for you.

41:51.810 --> 41:54.770
I want her to forgive me.

41:56.090 --> 41:57.650
For what?

42:02.890 --> 42:06.730
You know it's a sin not to tell
the truth in a sacred place.

42:16.330 --> 42:18.600
Brace?

42:18.650 --> 42:22.290
Brace? Brace, where's James?
I need to talk to him.

42:27.410 --> 42:29.920
Brace, I spoke to a witness.

42:29.970 --> 42:31.800
It wasn't James that killed the girl,

42:31.850 --> 42:34.280
it was the Company,
it was the East India Company.

42:34.330 --> 42:36.490
I need to tell James.

42:46.050 --> 42:47.730
Arsenic is gentle.

42:52.090 --> 42:53.640
It was mercy.

42:53.690 --> 42:56.730
Horace was no longer a Christian soul.

42:58.010 --> 43:00.810
I only wish I'd killed James, too.

43:02.090 --> 43:04.880
Give him a kind death.

43:04.930 --> 43:07.130
Protect him from himself.

43:08.570 --> 43:11.160
Instead, they've got him.

43:11.210 --> 43:13.320
What do you mean? Where is he?

43:13.370 --> 43:15.250
They took him to the Tower...

43:17.170 --> 43:21.520
where no-one will be kind enough
to feed him arsenic.

43:32.530 --> 43:34.410
Mr. Delaney...

43:35.930 --> 43:39.250
His Majesty seeks information.

43:41.770 --> 43:44.120
I really have no taste for this,

43:44.170 --> 43:47.610
so perhaps we can conduct
this business like gentlemen.

43:48.930 --> 43:52.240
They will allow no easy escape...

43:52.290 --> 43:54.130
to death.

44:00.290 --> 44:02.640
Since it is imperative
that we keep you alive

44:02.690 --> 44:05.280
until after your conviction
for treason,

44:05.330 --> 44:11.040
the doctor is here
to help and assist Mr. Arrow,

44:11.090 --> 44:15.960
who will do most
of the necessary work.

44:16.010 --> 44:18.280
Although, for some tasks,

44:18.330 --> 44:21.650
he will need helpers
with strong hands.

44:25.210 --> 44:29.330
And together, they will walk you
along a tightrope.

44:30.730 --> 44:33.760
A line between life...

44:33.810 --> 44:35.600
and death.

44:37.650 --> 44:39.520
We need the names of all the people

44:39.570 --> 44:42.170
who helped you manufacture
the gunpowder...

44:43.450 --> 44:46.640
move the gunpowder,
but most pressingly of all,

44:46.690 --> 44:48.640
we need the names of all the members

44:48.690 --> 44:52.360
of the Society
of Secret Correspondence

44:52.410 --> 44:54.490
that you have dealt with.

45:00.330 --> 45:02.090
The Americans.

45:04.890 --> 45:08.970
The places you met.
Code names, signals.

45:11.050 --> 45:14.850
The location of the powder
you gave them.

45:18.450 --> 45:20.480
Now, if you can give me all that

45:20.530 --> 45:22.680
and what you tell us is corroborated,

45:22.730 --> 45:25.480
then... then these people
won't be needed

45:25.530 --> 45:28.680
and you will await trial
in the same cell

45:28.730 --> 45:30.920
that Thomas Moore occupied,

45:30.970 --> 45:34.650
with not an unpleasant view
of the River Thames.

45:36.770 --> 45:38.090
So...?

45:40.330 --> 45:43.970
I will give you all the information
that you request...

45:46.410 --> 45:50.440
but in return,
I will need a single meeting with

45:50.490 --> 45:53.960
Sir Stuart Strange
of the East India Company

45:54.010 --> 45:59.210
here, in a cell, and in private.

46:05.370 --> 46:09.240
News of my arrest
will already be spreading.

46:09.290 --> 46:14.200
Those people that you seek...
they will already be fleeing London.

46:14.250 --> 46:19.240
You allow me my meeting
with Stuart Strange and perhaps,

46:19.290 --> 46:21.560
perhaps you will catch your Americans

46:21.610 --> 46:23.770
before they reach the ports.

47:04.010 --> 47:06.520
How long do you think it'll take?

47:06.570 --> 47:08.880
One, maybe two hours.

47:08.930 --> 47:14.050
Well, in that case, Mr. Delaney,
Sir Stuart Strange is busy.

48:03.450 --> 48:06.810
Give us the Americans
and then we'll stop!

48:37.810 --> 48:39.090
Sir!

48:42.890 --> 48:44.400
What did you say?

48:44.450 --> 48:47.290
Mr. Delaney, what did you say?

48:52.170 --> 48:54.090
Stuart Strange...

49:13.210 --> 49:14.360
Caddy...

49:14.410 --> 49:18.360
if you've lost your master,
go to the clubhouse and ask.

49:18.410 --> 49:19.450
Thank you.

49:28.090 --> 49:30.120
Don't stand there gawping.

49:30.170 --> 49:32.760
I have no master, sir.

49:32.810 --> 49:34.840
Well, you're not a player.

49:34.890 --> 49:37.770
No. Not of this game.

49:40.890 --> 49:43.760
Look, do you mind?
I've got a shot to make.

49:43.810 --> 49:45.810
So make it.

49:49.650 --> 49:51.170
Who the hell are you?

49:52.770 --> 49:55.680
My name is George Chichester.

49:55.730 --> 49:59.930
And when you have taken your shot,
I'd like to talk to you.

50:04.690 --> 50:06.490
I have nothing to say to you.

50:09.490 --> 50:12.120
You should know that I have testimony

50:12.170 --> 50:13.920
from a reliable witness...

50:13.970 --> 50:16.040
I've told you,
I have nothing to say to you.

50:16.090 --> 50:20.720
...someone who will swear on oath
that it was you who organised

50:20.770 --> 50:26.370
the loading of human cargo onto
the Cornwallis bound for Antigua.

50:27.450 --> 50:32.320
If your witness is Delaney, I think
you should know that, even now,

50:32.370 --> 50:37.010
he is being held in the Tower
of London charged with treason.

50:39.410 --> 50:45.250
Your "reliable witness" is a plotter
against the life of the King!

50:46.410 --> 50:47.730
No.

50:49.410 --> 50:51.250
I have another witness.

51:11.730 --> 51:13.730
Where exactly are we going?

51:39.370 --> 51:40.410
Fuck!

51:45.890 --> 51:49.420
We are aware that you have a certain...

51:50.040 --> 51:52.110
capacity for pain...

51:53.610 --> 51:58.330
which is why we've invited Dr. Ling.

52:01.290 --> 52:03.520
His unearthly potions...

52:04.770 --> 52:06.970
alter perceptions.

53:11.850 --> 53:13.640
The ducks will be flying.

53:13.690 --> 53:15.840
All the coaches to Bath
and Southampton

53:15.890 --> 53:18.680
- are being searched, Your Highness.
- For what? For whom?

53:18.730 --> 53:21.200
We have no idea who they are,
who they pretend to be.

53:21.250 --> 53:22.840
It's been 12 hours!

53:22.890 --> 53:24.160
He will break.

53:24.210 --> 53:26.570
No, he won't.

53:38.570 --> 53:42.730
Goddamn it, where are you?

53:46.170 --> 53:48.280
The lady at his lodging said

53:48.330 --> 53:50.480
she hadn't seen him
since this morning, sir.

53:50.530 --> 53:51.800
Oh, fuck.

53:51.850 --> 53:54.880
It seems there is much
about our friend Godfrey

53:54.930 --> 53:56.760
that we didn't know, sir.

53:56.810 --> 53:57.850
What?

53:59.250 --> 54:01.640
I went into his room.

54:01.690 --> 54:05.440
Half of his clothes
were women's clothes.

54:07.210 --> 54:09.170
He was a Molly, sir.

54:12.290 --> 54:15.720
Delaney was arrested
at the Molly House.

54:15.770 --> 54:19.440
Delaney will have put
Godfrey up to this. Hm?

54:19.490 --> 54:22.080
He'll have hidden him
in the dark places

54:22.130 --> 54:24.760
where Delaney is king,

54:24.810 --> 54:27.850
where giving up Delaney is treason.

54:45.330 --> 54:47.170
Mr. Delaney?

54:50.850 --> 54:53.840
Do you have anything to say to me?

54:53.890 --> 54:58.490
Mr. Delaney,
do you have anything to say to me?

55:01.210 --> 55:03.770
Stuart Strange.

55:25.250 --> 55:27.330
Give him what he wants.

55:36.370 --> 55:37.850
This is absurd.

56:01.890 --> 56:03.810
My God, look at you.

56:08.450 --> 56:13.770
Well, your plan worked...
you in a cell, me on a hook.

56:16.090 --> 56:18.690
I'm here. What do you want?

56:29.290 --> 56:32.090
I have a use for you.
