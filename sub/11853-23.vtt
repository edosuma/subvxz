Her sidekick? What's that mean?

02:07.227 --> 02:12.232

(Laughing)

11:16.475 --> 11:20.546
These are some of the stinky-est
socks I've ever smelled!

11:22.948 --> 11:26.018
(Siren wailing)

11:26.085 --> 11:27.753
(Tires screeching)

11:27.820 --> 11:32.758
Stop right there, Sid Fishy!
You're under arrest!

11:32.825 --> 11:35.628
Is that right?

11:35.694 --> 11:38.697
Squirt them with
the stink sauce, Roughy!

11:38.764 --> 11:42.435
You got it, boss!

11:42.501 --> 11:45.204
{\an1}Uh-oh.

11:45.271 --> 11:48.874
Ah! We smell horrible!

11:48.941 --> 11:51.177
{\an3}Gross.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.712
Smell you later, officers!

11:53.779 --> 11:56.449
(Laughing)

11:59.018 --> 12:00.352
For the third time this week,

12:00.419 --> 12:02.721
evil villain Sid Fishy
has stolen the smells

12:02.788 --> 12:06.759
from some of Big Bubble City's
smelliest places.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.595
<i>We take you live to the</i>
<i>Stinky Sock Supply Company,</i>

12:09.662 --> 12:13.566

<i>has just been soaked with--</i>

12:13.632 --> 12:17.937
Mayor Molly, the entire police
department just got stink'd!

12:18.003 --> 12:19.572
{\an3}Yes, I saw.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.774
Last night:
the garbage department.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.510
This morning:
the rotten egg factory.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.781
And now:
the Stinky Sock Supply Company.

12:28.848 --> 12:31.550
Pee-eww-ski! Wait a minute.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.820
Why would anybody
want to steal stinky smells?

12:34.887 --> 12:39.225
I can think of only one fish who
would do something like that:

12:39.291 --> 12:41.293
{\an3}Sid Fishy!

12:41.360 --> 12:44.763
Oh no! Wait. Who?

12:44.830 --> 12:48.467
Sid Fishy, the most evil villain
to ever strike Big Bubble City.

12:48.534 --> 12:53.472
I wonder what he's up to
this time.

12:53.539 --> 12:57.243
Whatever it is,
I'll bet it's something fishy!

13:00.713 --> 13:05.251
(Laughing)

13:05.317 --> 13:09.021
I think we've got all the smells
we need, eh, Orange Roughy?

13:09.088 --> 13:13.993
Garbage, rotten eggs,
stinky socks all mixed together

13:14.059 --> 13:16.595
to make my famous stink sauce!

13:16.662 --> 13:19.932
Have you ever smelled
anything so stinky?

13:19.999 --> 13:24.937
Just you, boss.

13:25.004 --> 13:28.474
(Laughing)

13:28.541 --> 13:31.844
Soon, everyone in
Big Bubble City

13:31.911 --> 13:34.280
will be totally stinky!

13:34.346 --> 13:36.882
And nothing can stop me!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.534
Sorry.

I'll use the Bubble Phone!

14:14.820 --> 14:17.590
<i>Mayor Molly</i>

14:27.866 --> 14:29.835
