00:12.512 --> 00:14.713
I don't get it.
Is he transferring or dying?

00:14.814 --> 00:16.415
Yeah, Glenn, this is terrible.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.083
Oh, I didn't make it. Mateo did.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.318
That makes sense.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.420
Shh! Pay attention.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.655
What am I gonna miss the most?

00:23.723 --> 00:24.929
Uh, the people?

00:26.086 --> 00:28.086
They're often hilarious

00:28.196 --> 00:32.049
Simple, basic. Just sort of harmless.

00:33.088 --> 00:34.989
Am I scared?

00:35.057 --> 00:36.196
Of course I'm scared.

00:36.406 --> 00:39.076
Wait, so, um, who's
asking you these questions?

00:39.242 --> 00:40.609
Uh...

00:41.964 --> 00:42.730
Whoa.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.113
- That is not your chest.
- Yes it is.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.747
Then take off your shirt.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.115
I had a big breakfast.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.483
My advice?

00:49.501 --> 00:52.779
I guess it would be leaving
every place you work at

00:52.987 --> 00:55.022
a little bit better
than when you found it.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.601
Did I do that here? Who can say?

00:58.567 --> 00:59.274
Yes.

01:00.281 --> 01:01.286
I think I did.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.188
Well, that was a massive waste of time.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.691
Okay, moving on.

01:05.777 --> 01:08.178
We have not had a tornado drill

01:08.180 --> 01:10.081
in eight years, so we really should...

01:10.092 --> 01:11.622
I started this journey

01:11.624 --> 01:12.866
as a small child in the Philippines...

01:16.031 --> 01:19.334
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:21.816 --> 01:23.684
So the tub faucet is now working,

01:23.751 --> 01:28.355
but the drain is clogged with...
I'm gonna say fur, not hair.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.314
Oh, hold on just one second, please.

01:30.314 --> 01:33.817
Guys, corporate is coming down
on employee fraternization

01:33.884 --> 01:35.095
due to a recent incident.

01:35.097 --> 01:37.672
The incident of you having
gay sex with Mateo?

01:37.922 --> 01:39.189
I'm not at liberty to say.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.858
And we actually just call it sex.

01:41.926 --> 01:43.259
Uh, but the point is, since you two

01:43.327 --> 01:45.662
have been recently intimate...

01:45.730 --> 01:47.464
Wait, does this mean
we gotta transfer too?

01:47.531 --> 01:49.632
Oh, no, no way.
I am just getting used to

01:49.700 --> 01:52.035
the wet horse smell
coming out of Elias's locker.

01:52.103 --> 01:54.137
Uh, no. Mateo only needs to transfer

01:54.205 --> 01:55.772
because I'm at a district level.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.225
Sorry, that sounded like I was bragging.

01:57.235 --> 01:58.899
- No it didn't.
- Okay, the point is,

01:58.900 --> 02:01.101
I just need you guys to fill out
these disclosure forms for me.

02:01.169 --> 02:02.302
Thank you. Hi, sorry about that.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.458
So the phone in my hotel room, yes.

02:04.539 --> 02:06.073
Sometimes when I'm on it,
I hear somebody breathing.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.131
This is where you'll be working?

02:08.311 --> 02:09.710
It looks so different.

02:09.776 --> 02:11.573
It's a Cloud 9 Signature.

02:12.246 --> 02:15.616
They have a beauty concierge,
their produce is all organic,

02:15.683 --> 02:19.086
and their cafe has never
given anyone diarrhea.

02:19.153 --> 02:21.121
- That is impressive.
- How did you get

02:21.189 --> 02:23.824
all these pictures of the store?

02:23.891 --> 02:26.460
- It's on Yelp.
- Ohh, yeah.

02:26.561 --> 02:29.329
It's a website where
people post reviews.

02:29.397 --> 02:32.432
Wait, do you think our store has a Yelf?

02:32.873 --> 02:34.267
I'm sure we do.

02:34.335 --> 02:36.069
Ah, well, it's amazing how quickly

02:36.137 --> 02:37.337
you all made this about you.

02:37.770 --> 02:40.207
- Voila!
- Oh, my God!

02:40.436 --> 02:41.727
Look at that!

02:41.846 --> 02:44.340
We're famous! 168 reviews.

02:44.409 --> 02:46.443
"Store's okay. I usually stop there

02:46.511 --> 02:48.012
because it's on my way home."

02:48.079 --> 02:50.281
We're on his way home.

02:50.348 --> 02:51.949
Uh...

02:52.017 --> 02:53.150
Wait, stop!

02:53.463 --> 02:57.915
"Cloud 9, more like Cloud 1,
as in the one star I'm giving

02:57.916 --> 02:59.693
because I can't give zero."

02:59.841 --> 03:01.295
Ha! He's a good writer.

03:01.443 --> 03:03.012
Glen, just ignore this.

03:03.013 --> 03:04.288
That guy's a troll.

03:05.115 --> 03:06.716
No, uh, no.

03:06.784 --> 03:09.051
Uh, he's a full-sized human being,

03:09.119 --> 03:11.954
non-mythical who writes
mean things on the Internet.

03:12.055 --> 03:13.723
- What?
- Yeah, 99% of the Internet

03:13.791 --> 03:15.658
is just people tearing
other people down.

03:15.726 --> 03:17.460
It's actually why I am considering

03:17.528 --> 03:20.296
- leaving social media.
- Just do it, already.

03:20.397 --> 03:22.826
Ugh, you don't get points
for talking about it.

03:23.467 --> 03:26.335
My friend Corona sells
her pee on the Internet.

03:28.472 --> 03:30.706
Hey, what'd you put
for nature of relationship?

03:30.774 --> 03:33.476
They only have "spouse,"
"family member," and "romantic."

03:33.544 --> 03:36.012
Yeah, I just marked romantic,
basically because

03:36.079 --> 03:38.080
it was the closest to where
my pen already was.

03:38.148 --> 03:40.249
Okay, look. There is nothing romantic

03:40.317 --> 03:41.484
about this relationship.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.352
I have been very clear about that.

03:43.420 --> 03:45.454
Yeah, I agree with you.
But we're not family members

03:45.522 --> 03:47.356
and we're definitely not married, so...

03:47.457 --> 03:48.761
I'm calling Corporate.

03:50.427 --> 03:51.483
You've called Corporate so much

03:51.483 --> 03:53.229
that you have memorized their number?

03:53.297 --> 03:54.330
You're gonna need to talk first.

03:54.398 --> 03:56.098
Ask for extension 224.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.901
If the operator hears my voice,
she won't put me through.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.037
Yeah, extension 224, please.

04:01.104 --> 04:02.238
Oh.

04:03.707 --> 04:05.141
Ha! I got through!

04:05.209 --> 04:06.843
You know, I feel kinda
bad that I got promoted

04:06.910 --> 04:08.244
and you guys didn't.

04:08.312 --> 04:09.689
Oh, is getting transferred

04:09.689 --> 04:12.215
because you're sleeping with
Jeff considered a promotion?

04:12.282 --> 04:13.816
He's so jealous.

04:13.917 --> 04:14.984
I know.

04:15.052 --> 04:17.153
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey.

04:17.221 --> 04:20.623
Got your transfer paperwork right here.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.421
So just go ahead and fill that out

04:22.422 --> 04:23.926
and get it turned in to me
with your Social Security card

04:23.994 --> 04:25.661
- and we're good to go.
- Cool.

04:25.729 --> 04:27.797
Um, I-I can actually
just give you the number.

04:27.865 --> 04:29.966
Uh, no, they actually need to
see the card these days.

04:30.033 --> 04:31.868
They gotta run it through E-Verify.

04:31.969 --> 04:33.703
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- No, no, no.

04:33.770 --> 04:37.540
No, I just didn't realize this
store was like Nazi Germany.

04:37.641 --> 04:40.710
Ve must see your documents.
Heil Hitler, Mein Fuhrer.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.718
- Social Security card.
- Great, no problem.

04:48.785 --> 04:50.201
No... no problem.

04:51.521 --> 04:54.689
Do undocumented people have documents?

04:55.259 --> 04:57.293
No. No, we don't.

04:57.361 --> 04:58.172
Oh.

04:59.521 --> 05:00.988
So, like, won't that be an issue?

05:01.056 --> 05:01.989
Yes!

05:03.262 --> 05:04.664
So... that's it.

05:05.386 --> 05:08.030
Corporate's gonna find out
that my documents are fake.

05:08.163 --> 05:09.535
I'm gonna get deported.

05:09.535 --> 05:11.865
And Jeff is gonna get back
together with his ex.

05:11.933 --> 05:15.035
Oh, congratulations, Chad. You win.

05:15.103 --> 05:17.204
You know what? Maybe you
should try talking to Jeff.

05:17.272 --> 05:18.539
Maybe he could... he could, like,

05:18.607 --> 05:19.673
fudge the paperwork or something.

05:19.741 --> 05:21.223
- Mm.
- Great idea.

05:21.911 --> 05:23.335
"Hey Jeff, you know how

05:23.366 --> 05:24.693
"you're barely even allowed to date me?

05:24.693 --> 05:27.873
Well, surprise, turns out you're
also illegally employing me."

05:27.888 --> 05:29.527
And I'd marry you if I could.

05:29.528 --> 05:33.442
But I'm supposed to marry Bo
and he already bought a tie.

05:33.543 --> 05:35.582
That's okay. Thanks anyway.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.386
You know what?

05:39.449 --> 05:40.623
Screw it. I'll do it.

05:41.705 --> 05:42.687
I'll marry you.

05:45.643 --> 05:46.710
Ew.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.512
I don't understand the problem.

05:48.579 --> 05:50.580
The problem, Maureen, is you have boxes

05:50.648 --> 05:52.616
for eight different types
of "Pacific Islander,"

05:52.684 --> 05:55.252
but only three for what
this relationship is.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.720
Well, it's just for the files.

05:56.788 --> 05:58.856
It doesn't matter. Just check the box

05:58.888 --> 06:00.356
and let's move on with our lives.

06:00.425 --> 06:02.959
Fine. Whatever.

06:03.027 --> 06:04.236
This doesn't mean that you're in love.

06:04.236 --> 06:06.196
It's just saying that
you're in a relationship

06:06.264 --> 06:10.233
that entails some level of
mutual attraction and closeness.

06:10.335 --> 06:13.416
Maureen, we're gonna need
to speak to your supervisor.

06:13.838 --> 06:16.173
Sometimes people ask me,
"Hey, how'd you get

06:16.240 --> 06:18.041
those light bulbs way up there?"

06:18.109 --> 06:19.776
And the answer is: I don't know.

06:20.812 --> 06:22.666
Oh, hey, Amy. This is Amy.

06:22.714 --> 06:24.981
She's our intrepid floor supervisor.

06:25.049 --> 06:26.583
Amy, this is him.

06:26.651 --> 06:28.292
Frenchfryguy81.

06:29.153 --> 06:29.886
Tim.

06:30.358 --> 06:32.289
The troll who wrote the Yelp review.

06:32.357 --> 06:34.823
Oh, oh. No, I wouldn't call him that.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.499
But... so, you invited him back?

06:38.996 --> 06:41.064
Yeah, I mean, I couldn't rest
knowing there was

06:41.132 --> 06:44.768
an unhappy customer out there
who thinks that this place is,

06:44.836 --> 06:47.537
you know, quote "a bleep show."

06:47.638 --> 06:49.247
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:49.636 --> 06:50.861
I was probably having a pretty bad day

06:50.861 --> 06:52.915
- when I wrote that review.
- Oh, we all come down

06:52.922 --> 06:54.808
with a case of the crabs sometimes.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.318
That's an interesting choice of words.

06:56.319 --> 06:58.767
Yeah, anyway, I'm giving
him the VIP tour.

06:58.790 --> 07:01.290
Come on, I'll show you
the giant trash compactor.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.471
- Oh, that is the VIP tour.
- Yeah.

07:03.472 --> 07:05.790
- Have fun.
- What else have you written?

07:06.291 --> 07:10.166
Uh, I once wrote a review of
the Burger King down on Delmar.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.816
Oh, I would love to read that.

07:12.324 --> 07:14.869
So is the fear you'd be
committing some kind of fraud?

07:14.869 --> 07:17.312
No, Robbie, Robbie.
You're not listening to us.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.614
Let me break this down for everyone.

07:18.629 --> 07:21.012
This is strictly sex. No one stays over

07:21.013 --> 07:23.394
and we keep an even tally
in terms of orgasms.

07:23.917 --> 07:24.739
Actually, now that I think about it,

07:24.754 --> 07:26.433
- I owe you a... yeah.
- I am well aware.

07:26.434 --> 07:27.675
This is T.J. from Legal.

07:27.676 --> 07:29.671
I've only been on the call
the last 36 minutes,

07:29.671 --> 07:32.348
but I still think that the
totality of the circumstances

07:32.349 --> 07:33.853
points to a romantic relationship.

07:33.861 --> 07:35.605
- Come on.
- Mm, dude, no, man.

07:35.605 --> 07:37.540
In a relationship, you know
things about the other person.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.095
I don't know anything
about Dina, nor do I care to.

07:40.095 --> 07:41.892
The feeling's mutual.
Where did I grow up?

07:41.892 --> 07:43.816
I don't know.
Is my father dead or alive?

07:43.817 --> 07:45.519
What is, "Don't care, Alex?"

07:45.520 --> 07:46.892
Guys, it's just a box.

07:46.892 --> 07:48.815
Actually, sorry to be
a fly in the ointment,

07:48.816 --> 07:52.038
but if there are absolutely no
feelings of intimacy involved,

07:52.039 --> 07:54.123
it could make things
a little grayer, legally.

07:54.124 --> 07:56.217
- Yes, that's our point.
- Thank you.

07:56.687 --> 07:58.897
Well thank God we looped in T.J.

08:00.678 --> 08:02.030
Hey, Glenn.

08:02.436 --> 08:04.513
We found a muddy tire in Softlines.

08:04.514 --> 08:06.204
Nobody knows how it got
there and we don't know

08:06.204 --> 08:08.972
- what to do with it.
- Yeah, okay, glad to hear.

08:08.973 --> 08:09.965
- Glenn.
- Hm?

08:11.189 --> 08:15.248
Oh, sorry, I'm just responding
to all these old reviews.

08:15.498 --> 08:17.127
- Oh...
- Like, in 2006,

08:17.128 --> 08:20.378
this lady found a pool
of vomit in Electronics.

08:21.721 --> 08:24.353
"Dear Verna301,

08:24.596 --> 08:26.727
we have cleaned up the vomit."

08:27.397 --> 08:29.068
We have cleaned up the vomit, right?

08:29.068 --> 08:30.517
Yeah. I believe so.

08:31.479 --> 08:33.145
Wha...

08:33.496 --> 08:36.236
Frenchfryguy81 updated his review!

08:37.157 --> 08:39.991
"So the manager invited
me back to the store

08:40.059 --> 08:44.709
and tried to brainwash me with
an hour-long propaganda tour."

08:45.832 --> 08:47.095
"Pathetic man."

08:48.368 --> 08:49.792
"Muppet voice."

08:51.004 --> 08:52.905
Why would anyone write this?

08:52.973 --> 08:54.673
Because he likes complaining.

08:54.741 --> 08:57.396
Don't engage. You won't win.

08:58.578 --> 09:00.012
Well, you can die trying.

09:10.757 --> 09:12.852
So we've got Robbie, T.J. from Legal,

09:12.899 --> 09:14.927
Delores from Compliance,
Mark from Operations,

09:15.028 --> 09:16.962
and the whole team
in Associate Relations.

09:17.248 --> 09:18.148
Is everyone up to speed?

09:18.343 --> 09:19.198
- Got it.
- Yep.

09:19.266 --> 09:20.632
Sorry if I cut out.
I'm on a cruise ship.

09:20.999 --> 09:22.200
I think what we're coming to here

09:22.384 --> 09:24.018
- is adding a fourth box.
- Yes!

09:24.237 --> 09:25.438
Yeah, that's all we're asking.

09:25.505 --> 09:26.505
Back on track.

09:26.791 --> 09:28.517
Okay, so what do we label the box?

09:28.541 --> 09:30.542
Um...

09:30.544 --> 09:31.848
Oh, uh...

09:31.871 --> 09:33.599
Like, uh, "Friends with Benefits"?

09:33.891 --> 09:35.714
Oh. I wouldn't say we're friends.

09:35.782 --> 09:37.483
Hmm, oh, so maybe more like a...

09:37.551 --> 09:41.086
and apologies, Maureen...
but like "A Hate Effing Thing"?

09:41.154 --> 09:43.729
Again, sorry, Maureen. That's okay, T.J.

09:43.745 --> 09:45.513
- I'm a grown-up.
- Yeah, you know what?

09:45.513 --> 09:47.305
The thing is that I don't hate Dina.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.861
Eh, I'm just more ambivalent.

09:48.929 --> 09:51.355
- Yeah, almost like an apathy.
- Maybe an apathy.

09:51.410 --> 09:52.765
Yeah, I could go with apathy.

09:55.001 --> 09:57.269
Sorry, that's me.
We're just pulling into port.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.002
So you're not a refugee.

09:59.003 --> 10:01.238
You're not a special
agricultural worker.

10:01.239 --> 10:03.223
Any interest in joining the military?

10:03.474 --> 10:04.174
Hm...

10:04.202 --> 10:05.943
I don't trust myself with a weapon.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.101
I would like killing too much.

10:08.363 --> 10:10.364
Oh, or you could just get beat up.

10:10.471 --> 10:13.340
"Person may be eligible
for a special U.N. visa

10:13.518 --> 10:15.452
"if they are a victim
of a violent crime,

10:15.520 --> 10:16.653
such as an assault."

10:16.721 --> 10:17.687
That's crazy.

10:17.755 --> 10:19.241
I can't believe that's real.

10:19.242 --> 10:21.273
So I would just need to get punched.

10:21.938 --> 10:25.495
No, it seems like you'd have
to get your ass beat pretty bad.

10:26.613 --> 10:29.548
Or, if you don't wanna
get your ass beat,

10:29.709 --> 10:31.510
I'm still willing to marry you.

10:31.969 --> 10:33.616
Oh, thank you, Jonah.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.102
When you put it like that...

10:35.506 --> 10:37.503
the ass beating doesn't sound so bad.

10:40.044 --> 10:41.078
Mm-mm.

10:41.839 --> 10:44.473
Hey, look at us. Two regular Joes,

10:44.475 --> 10:47.396
enjoying some good old FFs, huh?

10:47.710 --> 10:49.411
Yeah. Thanks.

10:49.479 --> 10:51.580
You really didn't have to do this.

10:51.648 --> 10:53.916
Well, I wanted to talk to you,

10:53.983 --> 10:55.951
not just as a store manager.

10:56.019 --> 10:59.121
You know, I'm also a human being.

10:59.189 --> 11:00.289
Here.

11:07.097 --> 11:09.164
Stupid.

11:09.232 --> 11:10.766
You get the...

11:10.834 --> 11:11.767
Do you need... do you need a hand?

11:11.835 --> 11:13.168
Hm?

11:13.236 --> 11:15.678
No, no, no. It... it's symbolic.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.975
Look, I regretted that review
as soon as I wrote it.

11:20.076 --> 11:21.592
You were so nice before.

11:22.078 --> 11:23.195
I'm sorry.

11:24.247 --> 11:26.748
Apology accepted.

11:26.816 --> 11:30.018
"So now this idiot drags
me back a second time

11:30.086 --> 11:33.186
to force feed me French fries
and do a strip show"?

11:33.723 --> 11:35.524
I used to be a people person.

11:36.025 --> 11:37.559
When I was at the hardware store,

11:37.627 --> 11:39.895
I could cheer up any unhappy customer

11:39.963 --> 11:43.067
with, like, a smile or a few words.

11:43.317 --> 11:47.704
Or sometimes I'd slam my finger
in the cash register as a joke.

11:47.770 --> 11:50.671
Ah, look, Glenn,
you're still a people person.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.692
I wish the Internet
had never been invented.

11:54.344 --> 11:56.311
Although then Jerusha wouldn't be able

11:56.379 --> 11:58.370
to buy her Chinese cigarettes.

12:07.056 --> 12:08.857
What the hell?

12:08.925 --> 12:09.992
Why did you do that?

12:10.059 --> 12:11.293
'Cause I felt like it.

12:11.361 --> 12:13.562
What are you gonna do about it?

12:13.630 --> 12:14.862
All right.

12:16.032 --> 12:18.033
I'm writing up a 32-50 on you.

12:18.101 --> 12:19.735
And that's going in your file for life.

12:19.836 --> 12:21.770
Your mom's a whore.

12:21.838 --> 12:23.906
I can't hear you. What did you say?

12:23.973 --> 12:26.275
Your mom is a whore!

12:26.342 --> 12:28.911
Okay, I'll get on that next.

12:30.543 --> 12:32.823
Hey, Brett. I'm mad at you, let's fight.

12:34.050 --> 12:37.119
Ah! What? Put that away, you psycho!

12:37.187 --> 12:38.687
Oh, my God!

12:38.755 --> 12:39.688
Jesus.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.203
Oh, hello, Frenchfryguy81.

12:46.453 --> 12:48.363
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

12:48.431 --> 12:50.432
- Now's not a good time.
- Why?

12:50.500 --> 12:52.801
Are you busy spewing hateful
things about good people

12:52.869 --> 12:54.403
from the comfort of your own...

12:56.005 --> 12:57.014
Home?

12:58.374 --> 12:59.549
Uh...

12:59.620 --> 13:00.242
Um...

13:02.512 --> 13:04.813
Timmy. Tim.

13:04.881 --> 13:08.424
I need you to restart
the "Quantum Leap" video.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.588
Mom, I'll take care of you in a minute.

13:11.117 --> 13:13.952
Oh, um, I... so...

13:15.604 --> 13:18.472
What about "Sexual Co-workers"?

13:18.474 --> 13:20.609
- Awful.
- Just say you don't care.

13:20.742 --> 13:22.443
- What about "Friends with..."
- Say "Friends with Benefits"

13:22.511 --> 13:24.466
one more time and see what happens.

13:25.110 --> 13:26.659
I was gonna say "Friends
with" something else.

13:26.675 --> 13:27.675
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.759 --> 13:29.400
What were you gonna say?

13:33.221 --> 13:35.029
- "Benefits."
- Yeah.

13:35.624 --> 13:36.521
Pathetic.

13:36.638 --> 13:39.749
My friends and I would say
that you guys are just chilling.

13:40.390 --> 13:43.325
Wait, full-on sex is now
considered just chilling?

13:43.393 --> 13:45.494
Uh-huh, and mouth stuff is hanging out,

13:45.562 --> 13:47.396
and hand stuff is pretty much,

13:47.497 --> 13:49.632
I like you but just as a friend.

13:49.699 --> 13:51.901
Hm. Wow, times have changed.

13:51.968 --> 13:52.902
Yeah.

14:09.519 --> 14:12.153
Sorry, this will just be
a couple of minutes.

14:14.491 --> 14:17.168
- Come on!
- No, I'm not gonna beat you up.

14:17.170 --> 14:19.328
Oh, so you'd just rather
I get kicked out of the country?

14:19.396 --> 14:20.362
I thought you were my friend.

14:20.463 --> 14:22.197
I am your friend.

14:22.265 --> 14:23.933
That's why I offered to marry you.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.835
For the last time,
I will not marry you, Jonah!

14:28.705 --> 14:31.240
I-I don't wanna marry him.

14:31.308 --> 14:33.409
I just think that he
should wanna marry me.

14:33.476 --> 14:35.311
Never mind. Keep shopping.

14:35.378 --> 14:38.647
Look, I know you don't want to hurt me,

14:38.715 --> 14:41.483
but not doing this is hurting me.

14:41.551 --> 14:42.156
So...

14:43.920 --> 14:45.433
if you're really my friend,

14:46.056 --> 14:48.192
please, beat the hell out of me.

14:51.328 --> 14:52.861
Okay, let's do this.

14:52.929 --> 14:54.196
Let's rumble.

14:54.297 --> 14:55.431
Oh.

14:58.435 --> 15:00.369
Why are you stretching your legs?

15:00.437 --> 15:01.870
That's where the power comes from.

15:01.938 --> 15:04.873
Okay. How do you want to do this?

15:04.941 --> 15:06.809
Uh, I don't know.

15:06.910 --> 15:08.611
I'm not really much of a fighter.

15:08.678 --> 15:10.980
I guess just start
with a punch in the face?

15:11.047 --> 15:12.848
Yeah, yeah, okay.

15:12.916 --> 15:14.249
Uh, uh...

15:14.317 --> 15:16.051
Maybe... maybe close your eyes.

15:16.119 --> 15:17.781
Yeah, just... yeah, okay, cool.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.558
Uh, on second thought, open your eyes.

15:22.626 --> 15:23.726
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Open?

15:23.793 --> 15:25.694
Okay.

15:25.762 --> 15:26.690
Here it comes.

15:27.797 --> 15:28.722
Here we go.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.433
No, see, now you're just staring at me

15:31.501 --> 15:32.635
and... and that's weird.

15:32.702 --> 15:34.088
Oh, come on.

15:34.174 --> 15:36.005
Uh, don't think of it as a hate crime.

15:36.072 --> 15:37.706
Well, I wasn't.

15:37.774 --> 15:39.441
But now I am.

15:39.509 --> 15:41.337
You could just stomp on his head.

15:42.979 --> 15:44.647
Yeah, how about I just do this?

15:44.714 --> 15:47.137
What if I just kind of go like this?

15:47.638 --> 15:49.456
And you just sort of walk into it.

15:52.288 --> 15:54.123
Maybe this is better? Yeah.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.875
- Come on, just hit me.
- I'm trying, okay?

16:02.876 --> 16:04.677
- Say something mean.
- Like what?

16:04.678 --> 16:05.998
Um, I don't know.

16:06.352 --> 16:08.343
Oh, say something mean about Beyoncé.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.066
I'd rather be deported.

16:10.454 --> 16:12.537
Mateo, it's not that easy
to just punch somebody

16:12.537 --> 16:13.790
that you're not fighting with.

16:13.792 --> 16:15.066
Fine. Then let's fight.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.216
- Well...
- Come on.

16:16.217 --> 16:17.685
- Okay, but I...
- Hit me, wuss.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.894
- Well, I-I... we already...
- Come on, hit me.

16:20.895 --> 16:21.901
Well, I... this is not necessary.

16:21.902 --> 16:23.787
- Hit me.
- I'd like... I'd like to hit you.

16:23.788 --> 16:24.346
Hit me.

16:24.346 --> 16:26.138
- No... Mateo, my point...
- Hit me!

16:26.139 --> 16:27.292
- Ow!
- Oh!

16:29.365 --> 16:31.199
All right!

16:31.268 --> 16:32.568
Now you go.

16:34.371 --> 16:36.205
I could tell he hit you hard
because it's the only time

16:36.273 --> 16:38.140
I've ever seen your hair move.

16:38.242 --> 16:39.909
I thought it was gonna be one of those

16:39.977 --> 16:42.812
straight guy things where
I hit you and you hit me back.

16:42.913 --> 16:45.147
Why isn't pacifism a straight guy thing?

16:45.249 --> 16:47.049
I don't know. It just isn't.

16:47.117 --> 16:50.319
So... what are you gonna do now?

16:53.323 --> 16:54.279
I don't know.

16:55.292 --> 16:57.670
Just... just talk to Jeff.

16:58.228 --> 17:00.762
He cares about you.
You'll... you'll work it out.

17:01.898 --> 17:03.156
Yeah, maybe.

17:04.134 --> 17:06.239
I'm sorry I didn't come through for you.

17:06.970 --> 17:08.406
Yeah, you really blew it.

17:10.273 --> 17:13.342
All right, we have been talking and...

17:13.410 --> 17:16.742
We'd like a fourth box added,
labeled as "Other."

17:17.180 --> 17:18.681
That's it? "Other"?

17:18.749 --> 17:21.138
We're very excited
about "Other," Maureen.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.789
Okay, fine. "Other" it is.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.186
- Legal signs off.
- Sounds good.

17:25.289 --> 17:27.290
I missed the Captain's dinner for this.

17:27.357 --> 17:29.025
All right.

17:29.092 --> 17:31.193
- "Other."
- Hey, I'm happy with it.

17:31.261 --> 17:32.194
- Boom.
- Did it!

17:32.262 --> 17:34.196
- Hey, good job.
- Yeah.

17:34.264 --> 17:36.165
Yeah.

17:36.233 --> 17:37.199
Okay.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.719
I'm gonna just go dock your pay,

17:39.829 --> 17:41.871
'cause you should have been
working all this time.

17:41.938 --> 17:43.205
Slacker.

17:43.307 --> 17:44.674
You got bird seed in your hair.

17:44.741 --> 17:45.525
Shut up.

17:49.313 --> 17:51.213
Did you give her the cookies?

17:51.315 --> 17:52.979
I gave them to her.

17:53.450 --> 17:55.184
You don't have to eat those.

17:55.252 --> 17:57.386
Well, I can't because they're dominoes.

18:03.293 --> 18:05.361
Look, I haven't worked in six months.

18:05.429 --> 18:07.396
GameStop said they were cutting back,

18:07.464 --> 18:10.813
but then I went in there,
and they hired four new girls.

18:12.887 --> 18:13.922
So then I get on the computer,

18:13.923 --> 18:16.183
where I'm the guy who can win
for a change.

18:18.310 --> 18:20.244
Oh, forget it.
I'm not explaining it right.

18:20.252 --> 18:22.253
No, no. I get it.

18:22.507 --> 18:26.000
I mean, it's not like
my life is so terrific.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.977
I have tons of debt.
My marriage is struggling.

18:31.938 --> 18:35.007
And it all feels like
it's never gonna change.

18:37.451 --> 18:38.306
Wow.

18:39.501 --> 18:41.186
Your life sounds as bad as mine.

18:42.545 --> 18:44.685
- Uh-huh.
- Timmy, one of the rabbits

18:44.685 --> 18:45.971
is eating the other one.

18:45.972 --> 18:47.853
I'll get around to it, Ma!

18:53.945 --> 18:55.584
You know, it feels like ages

18:55.725 --> 18:58.509
since I've just sat and talked
to somebody like this.

18:59.784 --> 19:03.129
Yeah. This is... this is nice.

19:04.155 --> 19:05.789
Friends?

19:05.857 --> 19:06.762
Friends.

19:08.159 --> 19:11.295
"And then this psycho stalker
doesn't eat the cookies

19:11.362 --> 19:13.096
my mom offered her."

19:13.164 --> 19:14.131
You wouldn't eat the cookies?

19:14.198 --> 19:16.033
Well, they were dominoes.

19:16.134 --> 19:19.269
The point is, he was as mean
to me as he was to you.

19:19.337 --> 19:22.172
Oh, no, he's way meaner to you.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.042
He says you're a munchkin.

19:25.143 --> 19:27.110
Glad to see you're feeling better.

19:27.178 --> 19:30.047
He calls you "Lamey Amy."

19:30.148 --> 19:31.551
Oh, that's clever.

19:32.817 --> 19:34.217
He's a good writer.

19:35.720 --> 19:36.887
Jeff.

19:36.988 --> 19:38.727
- Jeff, wait.
- Hey!

19:38.829 --> 19:41.191
Ah, a little celebratory dinner tonight?

19:41.259 --> 19:44.181
I made us a reservation
at the place with the fish tank.

19:46.030 --> 19:47.096
I can't transfer.

19:48.032 --> 19:49.470
What? Why?

19:50.234 --> 19:51.804
Uh... I just...

19:52.904 --> 19:56.073
It's complicated, but I... I just can't.

19:56.662 --> 19:59.005
All right, well, I mean,
we talked about it.

19:59.076 --> 20:00.494
I would transfer but there's...

20:00.971 --> 20:00.494
No, I'm not asking you to transfer.

20:00.494 --> 20:03.773
No, but I'm just saying,
if this is about your career,

20:03.874 --> 20:05.541
I totally get that.
It's not about the job.

20:05.609 --> 20:07.777
Okay, but it would be
a lateral move at worst for you.

20:07.878 --> 20:10.946
Jeff, please listen to me.
I just... I'm not...

20:12.856 --> 20:13.824
I'm not...

20:16.201 --> 20:17.397
in love with you.

20:19.863 --> 20:20.299
Oh.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.553
I...uh...

20:27.977 --> 20:29.585
Are you breaking up with me?

20:32.574 --> 20:35.542
I'm sorry.

20:46.136 --> 20:47.278
Are you okay?

20:49.388 --> 20:50.150
Not really.

20:50.151 --> 20:54.487
I just... I don't know if
I did the right thing...

20:56.411 --> 20:58.375
Ha. I did it!

20:59.059 --> 20:59.993
Whoo!

21:00.630 --> 21:01.997
- Ulch.
- Cheyenne, I did it.

21:02.065 --> 21:03.999
Oh.

21:05.445 --> 21:06.452
You're welcome.
