our conversation earlier.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.131
- I'm pretty sure we did.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.924
- But I was gonna show you how
I was able to go the beach

00:08.007 --> 00:10.051
and not get in trouble
for skipping school today.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.428
- Not interes--

00:12.637 --> 00:13.054
fine, show me.

00:15.473 --> 00:18.101
- So many places to go,
people to see,

00:18.184 --> 00:21.062
I can't do it all,
make another one of me.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.777
[laughs]
Pretty cool, huh?

00:27.861 --> 00:30.864
- You...have a twin?

00:30.947 --> 00:32.073
- No, I have a clone.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.119
- Jax Junior at your service.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.663
- Do you summon
him all the time?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.331
- Nah, just when I wanna
do something special.

00:40.415 --> 00:44.919
You know, skip school,
go to the movies, sleep in.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.004
- And then you send Jax Junior
in your place

00:46.087 --> 00:48.465
to things you don't want
to go to?

00:48.548 --> 00:51.509
- Yep. I haven't gone
to the dentist in five years.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.178
Junior over here goes for me.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.554
- No cavities.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.598
- That's amazing.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.517
Not that you haven't gone
to the dentist in five years.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.310
That's kind of gross.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.645
But that you have two yous.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.480
- The more Jax to
go around the better.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.149
It's pretty much my life motto.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.152
- And this...it's allowed?

01:09.235 --> 01:11.529
I mean, witches and wizards
can clone themselves?

01:11.613 --> 01:15.825
- Uh, depends what your
definition of allowed is.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.869
If you mean permitted by law--

01:17.952 --> 01:19.120
- Yeah.
- Then no.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.997
But if you mean
unofficially tolerated

01:21.080 --> 01:23.666
by the Witches Council--
- Yeah.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.168
- Okay, it's not allowed at all.

01:25.251 --> 01:29.798
Eh, the spell is very old
and very illegal.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.007
- How did you get it?

01:31.090 --> 01:32.467
- I saw my dad using it once.

He can't see you.

this vein that pops out

01:41.184 --> 01:43.645

whenever you panic.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.231
- Jax!
- Relax, I've got this.

01:46.314 --> 01:49.526
Junior, go hide in Emma's room.
- No, wait!

01:49.609 --> 01:52.695

pizza, and it's our favorite.

coming from over here.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.882

02:12.966 --> 02:18.471
What if he--I mean, I get
electrocuted or something?

02:18.555 --> 02:21.182
- Then you'll have
my dream hairstyle.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.894
- I'm perfectly okay with
holding onto your powers for you

02:24.978 --> 02:29.732
until you're, say, 18...or 30.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.735
You know, 55 would
really work for me, too.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.701
- There, power transfer begin.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.911

04:14.712 --> 04:16.964

04:17.048 --> 04:19.759
Mr. Alonso cast me as Romeo
in the school play.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.636

you liked acting.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.137

around in tights in front

Oh, that is so cute.

- And rehearsals are at
the same time as Shark practice.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.862
I think Mr. Alonso did that on
purpose, because he hates me.

- Okay, Daniel,
he doesn't hate you.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.908
He--he's trying to
teach you a lesson.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.452
- Like the lesson Sophie taught
you when she superglued the oven

04:46.536 --> 04:48.204
so you wouldn't eat us?

04:48.287 --> 04:49.706
- Exactly.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.584
You know, why don't you just go
over there and talk to him

04:53.668 --> 04:55.003
and see
if he'll move things around?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.421
- I don't think so.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.424
Four out of five times
that I'm around him,

04:59.507 --> 05:01.259
I do something that gets me
more detention.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.762
- Okay, Daniel,
you will be just fine.

05:04.846 --> 05:10.393
Just...try not to break anything
or spill anything on him.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.812
Or accidentally
set anything on fire.

05:14.147 --> 05:18.192
- So it was like a math party?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.695
- The cake was in the shape
of a plus sign.

05:20.778 --> 05:21.988
- [laughs]

05:22.071 --> 05:24.240
- And the party favors
were Sudoku.

let that stop you.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.294
you could have a piñata
in the shape of a vector.

You see, he gets it.

Hey, if you like math, why don't
you come to my presentation

of Miami?

I'm introducing

would be interested in--

05:52.477 --> 05:54.395
- I'd love to.
When is it?

05:54.479 --> 05:57.190

06:08.618 --> 06:09.952
I don't wanna intrude.

plenty of pizza, stay.

- Hey, Em, I left my wrench
here earlier, I just--

What are you doing here?

a collage for Emma.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.112
- Did it work?

20:43.367 --> 20:47.162
- Watch out, world,
the witch is back.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.125
- [laughs] That was amazing.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.335
You know I've snuck into buses
and concerts and movies

20:53.418 --> 20:56.338
all before, but never
all in the same night.

20:56.421 --> 21:01.051
- Clearly, you almost got us
caught a bunch of times,

21:01.134 --> 21:04.012
slowpoke.
- [laughs]

21:04.096 --> 21:08.433
- "I'm Jax,
and I move like a turtle."

21:08.517 --> 21:10.060
- I don't know
if it's the Fool Moon or what,

21:10.143 --> 21:12.521
but you're a lot more fun now.

21:12.604 --> 21:17.651
- For the first time
in my life, I feel alive.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.571
- Well, I really like you now.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.620
This is really great.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.329
You're really great.
