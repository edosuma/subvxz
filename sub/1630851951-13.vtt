Come on now,

Bring it in,

Alright, look at that,

See? Look at that.

[groans] See?

00:13.964 --> 00:16.799
I got a little clench in the
butt, not a full clench.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.400
That's how you know the
bag is light enough.

Huh? What is--what--full clench,

00:31.849 --> 00:33.282
- Okay, then--
- What is in your bag?

00:33.417 --> 00:36.552
- Hey, what's in my bag
is my business.

00:36.687 --> 00:38.620
- Okay, well whatever's
in your bag,

00:38.756 --> 00:40.556
better be under 50 pounds,
or else they're gonna

00:40.691 --> 00:41.724
charge you extra.

00:41.859 --> 00:44.493
- Exactly, they're gonna
charge you extra.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.595
And how you know yours is
under 50 pounds?

00:46.731 --> 00:48.964
- See your daddy's--the way
his muscles set up, babe,

00:49.100 --> 00:53.769
they usually tap out at
about 45, 46 pounds,

00:53.904 --> 00:56.839
let me see,
give 'em to me. Ah!

00:56.974 --> 01:00.375
- Yeah, that explains a lot.

01:00.511 --> 01:02.711
- Babe, babe--
- Oh yeah, there's no way

01:02.847 --> 01:05.681
that's under 50 pounds.
- Baby. What is in your bag?

01:05.816 --> 01:08.550
- What? Just everything
a woman needs to travel.

01:08.686 --> 01:10.352
- What's that?
A dead body?

01:10.488 --> 01:12.287
- LEAH: Okay, okay.

Sandra...what are you
smuggling in this bag?

01:26.036 --> 01:27.870
- I'm not smuggling anything.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.973
- My sister has become
a drug mule.

01:31.108 --> 01:33.008
Sad case.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.625
Boom!

Ooh, you know what I miss,

okay, I just got all the
flavor out the popcorn

02:00.538 --> 02:02.304
before I ate it.
- [laughs]

I know what you want, you want
a Chicago-style hot dog.

But you know what I really love?
- What?

02:24.028 --> 02:25.727
- What I really, really love?
- What, baby?

02:25.863 --> 02:28.030
- I would love for y'all to get
to the bag and take some of

02:28.165 --> 02:30.065
this crap out of your bags,
'cause they too heavy.

02:30.201 --> 02:31.667

in there,

02:42.513 --> 02:43.779
just like undergarments--
- No.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.647

I'ma go get it.

02:45.783 --> 02:47.149

forgotten about,

04:02.326 --> 04:05.227
so I just want to prepare
some food and bring some cookies

04:05.362 --> 04:08.130
and everything, and just add
to what you have for Christmas.

you gotta add much,

doing nothing.

04:25.115 --> 04:27.182
I plan on taking my
family back,

04:27.318 --> 04:28.750
not the whole house.

04:28.886 --> 04:31.286
- So you telling me you
don't have nothing planned?

04:31.422 --> 04:33.822
- No!
Not a damn thing.

04:33.958 --> 04:36.091
- Mr. Vinny!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

04:36.226 --> 04:37.559
They ain't got no candy canes,

04:37.695 --> 04:39.594
they ain't got no chestnuts
roasting,

04:39.730 --> 04:42.130
they got no halls
being decked,

04:42.266 --> 04:44.433
little elf shoes,

04:44.568 --> 04:46.168

They ain't got no tree, they
ain't got nothing.

04:48.739 --> 04:50.172
- No, it's not like that,

04:50.307 --> 04:52.507

04:52.643 --> 04:54.743
trying to do something
nice for my family.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.412
- Okay, I understand that.
I get that.

04:57.548 --> 04:58.680
But you know what?

04:58.816 --> 05:00.015
The weather's getting bad
out there.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.650
- Yeah, looked like it
was about to snow.

05:01.785 --> 05:04.086
You know traffic get bad
soon as ice hit the ground.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.121
- No, no, no way. Y'all playing.

05:06.256 --> 05:07.823
It was just sunny
a few hours ago.

05:07.958 --> 05:10.459
- Boy, this is Georgia,
the weather's unpredictable,

05:10.594 --> 05:12.861
just like 2020 has been.

05:12.997 --> 05:15.430
Unpredictable!

05:15.566 --> 05:18.567
- Oh no, no, you're right,
they said it's

05:18.702 --> 05:20.035
a winter storm heading this way
right now.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.703
- You wanna know what else is
unbelievable?

05:21.839 --> 05:25.507
How my beloved grandson is
taking his little raggedy family

05:25.642 --> 05:28.310
back to Chicago and leaving his
caring, beloved

05:28.445 --> 05:31.613
grandfather behind.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.015
- I asked you if you wanted to
go,

05:33.150 --> 05:34.483
you said you only fly
first class.

05:34.618 --> 05:36.251
Do you know much a
first class flight is

05:36.387 --> 05:38.186
from Atlanta to Chicago?

05:38.322 --> 05:40.055
- Well, we'll just trade
in the kids' two tickets.

05:40.190 --> 05:42.491
Bam, problem solved.

05:42.626 --> 05:44.426
- Cora, I'm sorry for
the mix up, okay?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.395
Alright, I gotta--I got to go.

05:46.530 --> 05:48.397
I'm gonna put the bags in the
car, okay?

05:48.532 --> 05:49.765
Sorry again, y'all.
- CORA: Okay.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.400
- MR. BROWN: Don't sound like
no mix up to me.

05:51.535 --> 05:52.901
- Well, I guess I'll go in
the back room

05:53.037 --> 05:55.470
with the rest of the sorry,
decrepit, miserable souls

05:55.606 --> 05:57.472
back there
and hang out with them.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.807
- No, Mr. Vinny,
don't do that.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.275
I mean,
I brought a lot of food,

06:00.411 --> 06:02.210
we gonna decorate, we gonna
celebrate for Christmas.

06:02.346 --> 06:04.813
- Yeah, I had Cora buy some
greens, beans, potatoes,

06:04.948 --> 06:08.250
hams, yams, cookies, cream,
potatoes, pie--

06:08.385 --> 06:10.052
- Mr. Brown, I didn't
bring all of that now.

06:10.187 --> 06:12.721
- You name it,
she brought it.

06:12.856 --> 06:14.523
- I brought a lot of food,
you know,

06:14.658 --> 06:16.525
it's already been prepared,
I just need to

06:16.660 --> 06:18.226
spruce it up a little bit.

06:18.362 --> 06:21.430
- I'm sorry, Cora, the holidays
is, you know, for children,

06:21.565 --> 06:24.066
and you know, women who want to
spend a lot of money, you know?

06:24.201 --> 06:27.169
I had a few women,
I had some in the '70s,

06:27.304 --> 06:31.506
I had a couple in the '80s,
had one in the '90s.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.041
- Only one in the '90s?

06:33.177 --> 06:35.644
- Yeah, the budget cuts.
In fact, the only spirits

06:35.779 --> 06:39.047
I'm into right now is making
my world famous egg nog

06:39.183 --> 06:42.717
that I make every year
for my ho-ho-hos.

06:42.853 --> 06:44.186
- Well, I'm sorry you
feel that way.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.221
- Yeah, well you know,
ever since my wife passed,

06:46.356 --> 06:48.523
you know, I ain't been
too jolly about the holiday.

06:48.659 --> 06:49.958
- CORA: Okay.
- And then they got

06:50.094 --> 06:51.660
all these commercials.
I mean you've seen them,

06:51.795 --> 06:54.129
you gotta buy this,
you gotta buy that toy,

06:54.264 --> 06:56.131
get this toy, get that--
it just ain't worth it,

06:56.266 --> 06:58.500
it ain't, it ain't worth it.
- MR. BROWN: Oh.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.102
Oh, Cora, let's just
hurry up so we can spread

07:00.237 --> 07:01.970
some Christmas cheer.
That's negative.

07:02.106 --> 07:03.872
- Mr. Brown,
now we can't make them

07:04.007 --> 07:05.574
have a Christmas Spirit now.

07:05.709 --> 07:06.942
- Okay, Cora, you finna
do that?

07:07.077 --> 07:08.343
- What?
- You finna sit here

07:08.479 --> 07:09.878
and you gonna sit here
and let the devil win?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.646
- No.
- I ain't finna do that.

07:11.782 --> 07:13.849
I ain't finna to do it.
- But Mr. Brown...

07:13.984 --> 07:15.784
But Jeremy and his family
about to leave,

07:15.919 --> 07:19.087
I mean, what's the point?
- Cora, what's the point?

07:19.223 --> 07:20.889
- Yeah.
- The point is the Lord

07:21.024 --> 07:22.157
sent us here,
what you talking about?

07:22.292 --> 07:25.727
What's the point?
Woman, where is your faith?

07:25.863 --> 07:27.496
We on a mission.
- You right.

07:27.631 --> 07:29.531
- I'm not finna let the
devil win.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.167
Lord, send us a sign.

07:32.302 --> 07:34.503
- What kind of sign, Mr. Brown?
- [doorbell rings]

07:37.541 --> 07:38.840
- Flight got canceled.

07:41.311 --> 07:43.879
- There's your sign.

07:44.014 --> 07:46.681
- Won't he do it?
- Yes, he will! [laughs]

07:48.118 --> 07:50.886
- You still packing? Damn.
- Uh-huh.

07:51.021 --> 07:52.988
You know what, baby?
You just gonna have to

07:53.123 --> 07:55.223
make this work.
I tried, I tried,

07:55.359 --> 07:57.692
but you gonna have to pay
that extra baggage fee, bruh.

07:57.828 --> 07:59.895
- No, baby, we got bad news.
- Huh?

08:00.030 --> 08:01.897
- Yeah.
- Wh--why does it look like

08:02.032 --> 08:04.533
you got into a fight
with the tree?

08:04.668 --> 08:07.035
- Man, I went out there
to put the bags in the car,

08:07.171 --> 08:08.937
then it just started
getting windy,

08:09.072 --> 08:11.540
and then it started snowing,
and then the trees

08:11.675 --> 08:13.742
and the branches--
- Baby, I'm sorry you got

08:13.877 --> 08:16.144
into a fight
with the weather.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.847
Wait, hold on, did you just
say it was snowing?

08:18.982 --> 08:21.850
It was just beautiful
and sunny outside.

08:21.985 --> 08:25.487
- I know, I just don't
understand this Georgia weather.

08:25.622 --> 08:27.789
It's ridiculous.
- Me either. Ooh.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.824
Ha-ha! But you know what?
We can probably

08:29.960 --> 08:31.927
take my other coat out,
and that will save you

08:32.062 --> 08:35.030
a few pounds
on the muscles, bruh.

08:35.165 --> 08:36.998
- No, baby,
that's the bad news,

08:37.134 --> 08:39.201
our flight is canceled.
- What?

08:39.336 --> 08:44.005
- Yes, they canceled all the
flights in the southeast.

08:44.141 --> 08:47.475
- That sucks.
- I know, man, I'm sorry.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.978
- It's not your fault.

08:50.113 --> 08:55.617
It's not like you summoned God
and told him to make it snow.

08:55.752 --> 08:56.985
Or did you?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.954
You don't want me to
see my sister?

08:59.089 --> 09:01.690
- Look, this is not the time
to make jokes.

09:01.825 --> 09:04.826
- Oh, well, I guess it is
his son's birthday,

09:04.962 --> 09:07.629
so he can do whatever
he wants to.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.764
[laughs]

09:09.900 --> 09:12.767
I guess we can just make
the best of the situation

09:12.903 --> 09:16.504
and have us a little
Christmas staycation.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.273
- True.

09:18.408 --> 09:19.941
- You know the kids
ain't gonna like that,

09:20.077 --> 09:21.910
but it'll be alright.

09:22.045 --> 09:25.247
- You right.
And the Browns are here.

09:25.382 --> 09:26.948
And Cora said she cooked.

09:27.084 --> 09:30.952
And Mr. Brown said he's gonna
try to decorate.

09:31.088 --> 09:33.455
Hate to see what that look like.

09:33.590 --> 09:36.358
- Oh, we'll just make the
best of the situation, baby.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.627
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

09:40.897 --> 09:44.065
- You done packed a little
mistletoe, huh?

09:44.201 --> 09:46.401
- I guess I can put it up,
since we ain't going nowhere.

09:46.536 --> 09:49.504
- Oh, oh or...

09:49.640 --> 09:53.642
Or we could get this little
staycation started right now.

09:53.777 --> 09:55.777
[laughs]

09:55.912 --> 09:58.780
- You trying to get your
jingle bells rocked, boy?

09:58.915 --> 10:02.717
- Ho, ho, ho.
- [laughs]

10:06.390 --> 10:09.758
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

10:09.893 --> 10:11.893
Oh, don't you
look beautiful?

10:12.029 --> 10:15.730
- Yes, I do, don't I? [laughs]
- [laughs]

10:15.866 --> 10:17.832
And Merry Christmas, fellas.

10:17.968 --> 10:19.634
I heard y'all were feelin' a
little low?

10:19.770 --> 10:21.303
- Eh, a little.

10:21.438 --> 10:23.972
I had to drag Reggie
out of his room.

10:24.107 --> 10:26.808
- Mr. Reginald,
you feeling a little blue?

10:26.943 --> 10:28.743
- Something to that effect.

10:28.879 --> 10:33.615
- But, in 1967, when I was
on tour

10:33.750 --> 10:35.250
with Pearl Bailey--
- Yes.

10:35.385 --> 10:39.587
- --and Cab Calloway
in "Hello Dolly,"

10:39.723 --> 10:41.289
we used to sing this song,

10:41.425 --> 10:44.159
"Put on Your Sunday Clothes When
You're Feeling Down and Out."

10:44.294 --> 10:47.228
That's the day that you
should dress up

10:47.364 --> 10:51.800
and make yourself feel alive--
- CORA: Yes!

10:51.935 --> 10:54.102
- --in spite of your troubles.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.771
- Thanks, but I'll leave the
festive wardrobe to you.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.640
Though you do look outstanding.

10:58.775 --> 11:00.809
- Thanks, doll.

11:00.944 --> 11:02.811
- We smelling something
delightful there?

11:02.946 --> 11:04.579
- So we came down
to check it out.

11:04.715 --> 11:07.248
- I did bring some food,
and Mr. Brown is, you know--

11:07.384 --> 11:09.384
we decorating,
Mr. Brown is outside

11:09.519 --> 11:11.920
cutting down a pine tree.

11:12.055 --> 11:13.688
- He has to be careful.
- What?

11:13.824 --> 11:15.957
- There's a family of squirrels
that lives in those trees,

11:16.093 --> 11:17.926
and they can be
very aggressive.

11:18.061 --> 11:20.228
- Squirrels?
- Yeah, so, I don't know

11:20.364 --> 11:21.830
what part of town
they come from,

11:21.965 --> 11:24.165
but they are definitely
about that life.

11:24.301 --> 11:25.333
- Oh.

11:25.469 --> 11:27.068
- Cora, can I be
of any assistance?

11:27.204 --> 11:29.003
- No, Mr. Reginald,
you don't have to do anything.

11:29.139 --> 11:30.739
- It'd be my pleasure.
- Well, you can hand me

11:30.874 --> 11:32.240
those flowers
out of that box,

11:32.376 --> 11:34.275
and you can start getting
those Christmas lights out.

11:34.411 --> 11:36.077
- Okay.
- CORA: Yeah, I'll take that

11:36.213 --> 11:37.379
and I'll put that...
- So, Ms. Cora--

11:37.514 --> 11:39.280
- Yes, sir?
- What am I smelling?

11:39.416 --> 11:42.951
- Well actually,
we have some Christmas cookies,

11:43.086 --> 11:44.753
we have some
sweet potato pie,

11:44.888 --> 11:46.421
we got a whole lot of stuff
over there.

11:46.556 --> 11:49.324
- If that pie is as good
as it smells,

11:49.459 --> 11:53.962
my figure is in trouble.
- Well, you in trouble!

11:54.097 --> 11:55.630
- Where did this
come from?

11:55.766 --> 11:57.799
- Oh, Mr. Brown got that--
brought that box out.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.068
- No, I know, I mean
this wreath.

12:00.203 --> 12:03.037
This belongs to me,
this here's mine.

12:03.173 --> 12:04.472
- We were just--
- You all had no right!

12:04.608 --> 12:06.074
- Well were just putting out
Christmas things.

12:06.209 --> 12:08.343
- What are you doing with all
this for? Stop it!

12:08.478 --> 12:10.512
- Mr. Brown--
- Just stop it right now!

12:10.647 --> 12:16.217
- [somber piano music]

12:17.604 --> 12:19.137
- Yes, we hear you
Mr. Reginald.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.673
I'm sorry, we was just putting
out some Christmas decorations,

12:21.808 --> 12:24.309
I didn't know,
I'm so sorry, Mr. Reginald.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.444
- Oh no, it's alright.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.446
And Cora, thanks for not
forgetting about us,

12:28.582 --> 12:31.149
so many people do.
- I'm--I'm--I'm sorry,

12:31.284 --> 12:36.488
I just, I...

12:36.623 --> 12:41.092
I bought this for my wife,
and she left it

12:41.228 --> 12:45.797
when she left our marriage,
and I used to stare at it

12:45.932 --> 12:49.834
for hours,
hoping she'd--

12:49.970 --> 12:51.903
she'd come back.

12:52.038 --> 12:56.774
I--I didn't realize it would
trigger such a response.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.010
- [doorbell rings]
- So sorry.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.380
- Cora! Cora! Y'all help!
- CORA: What is it?!

13:02.516 --> 13:03.681
- They trying to get me, Cora!

13:03.817 --> 13:05.283
- Who trying to get you?
- Them squirrels!

13:05.418 --> 13:06.718
- The squirrels?
- Yes, I went out there

13:06.853 --> 13:08.586
trying to get this tree,
they come and attacked me, Cora,

13:08.722 --> 13:11.990
about five of them.
Cora, they tried to kill me!

13:12.125 --> 13:13.992
- Mr. Brown, you got
violated by a squirrel?

13:14.127 --> 13:17.495
- Brown was
violated by a squirrel! [laughs]

13:17.631 --> 13:23.701
- [laughing]

13:26.606 --> 13:27.872
- MR. BROWN: It ain't that
funny.

13:28.008 --> 13:28.840
- [laughing]

13:28.975 --> 13:30.608
- I could've been
killed, Cora!

13:30.744 --> 13:32.343
I could've been--
I could've been killed

13:32.479 --> 13:34.913
and dead in my grave.
- What?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.848
- I needed that.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.285
Fellas, I haven't laughed like
that in a long time. [laughs]

13:40.420 --> 13:42.387
- That's so good,
Mr. Reginald.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.122
- Cora, ain't nothing
that funny!

13:44.257 --> 13:46.457
Laugh like I haven't
laughed in a long time!

13:46.593 --> 13:48.626
I could've been killed
by them squirrels!

13:48.762 --> 13:50.795
- Mr. Brown--
- Cora, I think I need to

13:50.931 --> 13:53.898
be checked for the rabbits.
- You mean the rabies!

13:54.034 --> 13:56.601
- Whatever it is, Cora,
they could've killed me!

13:56.736 --> 13:58.136
- We can't do nothing
with that tree,

13:58.271 --> 14:00.038
we can't decorate that.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.373
- Cora, you mean to tell me I
was out there on the front line,

14:02.509 --> 14:03.975
trying to get this tree,

14:04.110 --> 14:06.644
and you telling me we can't
decorate it?

14:06.780 --> 14:08.780
- That ain't no tree,
that's a limb!

14:08.915 --> 14:10.748
That's the best you could
bring back?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.984
- Reggie, how about you and I go
out there

14:13.119 --> 14:16.421
and take care of it?
- How about you shut up?

14:16.556 --> 14:19.390
- Challenge accepted,
we'll look into it.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.726
Thank you, Ms. Cora.
Merry Christmas.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.996
- Merry Christmas,
Mr. Reginald.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.598
- Cora, they finna
get killed!

14:26.733 --> 14:28.066
- Mr. Brown!

14:28.201 --> 14:29.834
- That squirrel's gonna
tear their butt up!

14:29.970 --> 14:31.202
- Mr. Brown!

14:31.338 --> 14:32.870
- Let's see if Kunta Kinte
and them can take care

14:33.006 --> 14:34.672
of that squirrel.
- Don't do that.

14:34.808 --> 14:35.940
- Ain't nobody doing nothing,
I could've been killed.

14:36.076 --> 14:36.908
Well ho-ho-ho!

14:37.043 --> 14:38.743
- Well ho-ho-ho
to you too!

14:38.878 --> 14:40.878
We need a better tree!

14:41.014 --> 14:43.948
- And that's why you
never lead with spades, see?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.150
I can't believe your mom and
daddy ain't teach y'all

14:46.286 --> 14:47.585
how to play this game.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.722
- I don't think they're
any good at it.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.024
- Man, I really wanted to go
back home.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.459
- Me too.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.628
- Oh yeah, about that, I'm glad
your little punk ass trip

14:56.763 --> 14:59.063
got canceled.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.798
- Thanks.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.433
- I thought when you get old,

15:02.569 --> 15:03.968
you're supposed to get the
Christmas spirit?

15:04.104 --> 15:07.872
- Only spirit I get down with
is this one in my flask.

15:08.008 --> 15:12.277
- What's that?
- I make it in my room.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.879
- I don't think you're supposed
to be doing that in your room.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.547
- That's why it's special.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.450
- BOTH: [laughing]

15:19.586 --> 15:21.152
- Hey, where have you
guys been?

15:21.288 --> 15:23.554
- Oh honey, we took a little
tour around the house,

15:23.690 --> 15:27.058
we wanted to see the decorations
Cora put up!

15:27.193 --> 15:29.627
They look amazing, Cora.
- CORA: Thank you, thank you.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.062
- Yes honey, then we got
caught outside

15:31.197 --> 15:34.232
talking to the old people.
Well, you know what?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.267
I'll say lightly seasoned.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.736
- Yeah, yeah, we was out there
talking about back in the day.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.339
Did y'all know that Reginald
invented applesauce?

15:41.474 --> 15:44.242
- [laughs]
- LEAH: Reginald.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.011
- Did y'all know that Mr. Brown
got attacked by squirrels?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.780
- [laughs]
- Tell you what, man,

15:48.915 --> 15:51.516
I outta call Child Protective
Services on you, man?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.117
- Why would you do that?

15:53.253 --> 15:54.886
- Because you let these
black kids go out into the world

15:55.021 --> 15:57.488
and not know how to play Spades
man, that is illegal.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.990
- Grandpa Vinny, calm down.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.159
They never really seemed
interested, so you know.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.593
- Because you guys are terrible.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.896
- Whoa, buddy, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.065
Now your Momma over here,
she good on that table,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.200
now your Daddy
on the other hand,

16:09.336 --> 16:11.736
oh, he's standing right there,
shh.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.038
- VINNY: Don't worry--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

16:14.174 --> 16:16.974
my game is tight.
- Oh, oh, okay.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.643
- Don't worry about it,
I handled it,

16:18.778 --> 16:20.211
I taught them how to play,
you know,

16:20.347 --> 16:22.580
when I teach them,
my students never lose.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.148
In fact, you know, if you
challenge them to a game

16:24.284 --> 16:26.818
right now,
I bet they'd tap that ass.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.587
- You mean behind?
- No, I mean ass.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.557
- [laughs]
Grandpa.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.992
- Come on, Dad.
- Yeah, Mom, come play.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.894
- Oh, wait a minute now.
You sure you want your Momma

16:37.030 --> 16:38.496
to get on the table?
'Cause I love y'all

16:38.631 --> 16:39.964
and everything,
y'all my babies,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.500
I love you dearly,
so um,

16:42.635 --> 16:47.739
d-d-d-don't t-t-t-take this
a-a-a-ass whooping p-p-p-p--

16:47.874 --> 16:50.708
- BOTH: Personally!
- [grunts]

16:50.844 --> 16:52.410
Let's go!
- JEREMY: Yeah.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.444
- Bring it.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.979
- [laughs]
- You know what?

16:55.115 --> 16:56.714
I actually thought
it would be harder than that.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.549
- Yo, I didn't
even get board.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.220
- Y'all got set!
That was pathetic!

17:02.355 --> 17:03.921
- All you had to do
is read the table,

17:04.057 --> 17:06.057
that's all you had to do,
Jeremy!

17:06.192 --> 17:08.025
You know, you never
lead with a spade

17:08.161 --> 17:09.961
ever, ever, ever,
they wouldn't have got

17:10.096 --> 17:11.829
ten books over here
had you read the table,

17:11.965 --> 17:12.930
read the table.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.799
- But the game is called Spades.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.467
- You cut with them!

17:16.603 --> 17:18.970
- [laughing]

17:19.105 --> 17:20.905
- Well, your kids
are amazing.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.673
If y'all would've played
with somebody who really

17:22.809 --> 17:24.609
knew how to play, y'all,
well they would

17:24.744 --> 17:26.811
beat the brakes
off of y'all!

17:26.946 --> 17:29.647
- You know that's cute
and everything, Cora,

17:29.783 --> 17:32.016
but they learned from
Many Vinny,

17:32.152 --> 17:34.786
and my students never lose.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.054
- Is that right?
- That is absolutely right.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.623
- I tell you what,
I could beat you.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.024
- I need a new partner!

17:40.160 --> 17:41.392
- Play?
- LEAH: Come on.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.994
- I'ma pick my--
Sandra gonna be my partner!

17:43.129 --> 17:45.062
- Well you know what?
I don't play anymore,

17:45.198 --> 17:46.898
I just teach.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.233
- Oh, so that's what it is?
No, I'm gonna be the one

17:49.369 --> 17:51.869
doing the teaching.
- [everyone exclaims]

17:52.005 --> 17:54.138
- That's definitely a shot
at your manhood.

17:54.274 --> 17:59.811
- Oh, okay Christian, damn it,
cut them, let's do it.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.646
- Hey, guys, I'm sorry
I didn't get y'all back home

18:01.781 --> 18:03.481
to Chicago for Christmas.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.949
- It's okay,
we had a good time.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.784
- Yeah, it wasn't
that bad.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.887
- I enjoyed our little
staycation, too.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.290
But you, baby cakes,
you gotta learn

18:12.425 --> 18:15.993
how to read that table.
