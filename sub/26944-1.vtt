01:23.121 --> 01:28.121
- What's
going on down there?

01:29.451 --> 01:30.701
- What's wrong?

01:32.732 --> 01:37.193
- You know, we could try
some girl-on-girl action.

01:41.140 --> 01:42.193
Maybe that'll work.

01:43.351 --> 01:46.350
- Sure, no problem.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.500
- Where do you want us?

01:50.210 --> 01:51.583
- Over there on the couch.

01:53.907 --> 01:54.740
- Okay.

04:30.363 --> 04:32.440
- I was renting an
office above the liquor store

04:32.440 --> 04:34.003
at 278 Mercado Street.

04:34.910 --> 04:36.970
The rent was 1,600 a month.

04:36.970 --> 04:39.910
I had one desk, three chairs,

04:39.910 --> 04:42.033
and a carpet no cat would have kittens on.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.410
It was Thursday and I was
expecting a new customer

04:45.410 --> 04:46.710
who had called me earlier.

04:47.690 --> 04:49.010
- Clyde Cooper?

04:49.010 --> 04:50.010
- That's me.

04:50.010 --> 04:51.510
- Vincent Donovan.

04:51.510 --> 04:53.090
- Good to meet you.

04:53.090 --> 04:53.923
- Likewise.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.970
How long have you been in business?

04:57.970 --> 04:58.803
- Long enough.

05:00.330 --> 05:01.960
- Well, tell me more.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.420
If I'm gonna throw my money at somebody,

05:03.420 --> 05:05.620
I like to know who I'm throwing it at.

05:05.620 --> 05:06.893
- What do you want to know?

05:08.140 --> 05:09.073
- You an ex-cop?

05:09.950 --> 05:10.783
- No.

05:11.970 --> 05:15.350
I worked for the District
Attorney as an investigator once.

05:15.350 --> 05:17.910
But I got fired for insubordination.

05:17.910 --> 05:20.350
I test high in insubordination.

05:20.350 --> 05:23.630
- What kind of investigations
do you specialize in?

05:23.630 --> 05:25.230
- Whatever the cops don't touch.

05:26.406 --> 05:27.239
- I see.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.450
- What about you?

05:32.420 --> 05:33.810
What's your story?

05:33.810 --> 05:35.810
- I used to be a lobbyist.

05:35.810 --> 05:38.593
About a year ago, I left
D.C. to invest in technology.

05:39.470 --> 05:40.920
- What kind of technology?

05:40.920 --> 05:41.753
- We're a startup.

05:41.753 --> 05:44.600
We help other startups to start up.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
- Sounds like money.

05:49.540 --> 05:50.830
So, what can I do for you?

05:50.830 --> 05:52.593
- I want you to find this girl.

05:55.610 --> 05:57.320
- She's beautiful.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.493
- The love of my life.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.260
Didn't last long.

06:02.260 --> 06:03.393
It was intense,

06:04.480 --> 06:09.480
but somehow I didn't realize
it because when I was with her,

06:09.630 --> 06:12.433
it was like I was possessed.

06:13.890 --> 06:17.170
Since she disappeared,
I've been a nervous wreck.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.660
- You want a drink?

06:18.660 --> 06:19.493
- Sure.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.620
I met her at the View
Lounge at the Marriott Hotel

06:23.620 --> 06:25.490
in San Francisco.

06:25.490 --> 06:27.780
Went there with an old
buddy of mine, George,

06:27.780 --> 06:29.303
works in electronics.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.130
So we went to the View for some drinks

06:33.130 --> 06:35.910
and there we met a couple
of divine looking chicks.

06:35.910 --> 06:38.090
One thing led to another and...

06:38.090 --> 06:40.680
Well, I really connected with this one.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.913
Her name's Denise.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.580
We spent a few days together.

06:45.580 --> 06:48.543
And then about a week ago, she
stopped answering my calls.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.827
I was worried because I gave her money

06:52.827 --> 06:55.750
and I thought she might've
overdosed on pills.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.740
So, I went to her house
to see if she was okay.

06:58.740 --> 07:01.713
She didn't answer the door,
so I went around the back.

07:09.140 --> 07:12.100
Denise, it's Vincent!

07:12.100 --> 07:12.933
Open up!

07:20.270 --> 07:21.710
- Who are you?

07:21.710 --> 07:23.090
- I'm looking for Denise.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.080
- I am Denise.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.730
- I'm looking for another
Denise, Denise Morgan.

07:26.730 --> 07:28.440
- I am Denise Morgan.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.273
And who are you?

07:34.619 --> 07:36.070
- You sure it was the same house?

07:36.070 --> 07:38.050
- Come on, I'm not that senile.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.603
I spent three nights in there.

07:42.007 --> 07:44.103
$2,000 down payment.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.803
You find her, there'll be more.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.280
- I can't guarantee any results.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.213
- Fair enough.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.660
See what you can find out.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.633
- Okay, but I'm gonna
need a few more details.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.240
Once in a while, right in the
middle of an ordinary life,

08:17.240 --> 08:18.833
love gives us a fairy tale.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.850
Love can be magic.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.323
But in my business, we
don't believe in magic.

08:50.570 --> 08:53.883
- So, Vincent told me that
his girl's gone missing.

08:54.810 --> 08:55.643
- Yeah.

08:55.643 --> 08:56.476
- Is she okay?

08:56.476 --> 09:00.380
- No, that's why I wanted
to ask you about your girl.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.730
- My girl?

09:01.730 --> 09:03.290
- Vincent told me you met these two girls

09:03.290 --> 09:04.520
at the View Lounge.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.550
They seemed to be friends with other.

09:06.550 --> 09:08.120
- Yeah, I mean, I thought so.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.910
But I do not know what happened to 'em.

09:10.910 --> 09:13.463
I mean, it was kinda just
a one night stand for me.

09:14.880 --> 09:15.990
- Did you ever get her number?

09:15.990 --> 09:17.440
- No, didn't really ask for it.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.053
- You have any pictures of her?

09:20.390 --> 09:22.493
- I'm not what you call
the sentimental type.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.070
- George was a dead end street,

09:25.070 --> 09:27.030
so I had to rewind the tape,

09:27.030 --> 09:29.280
go back to where the drama started.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.053
The lounge at the Marriott Hotel.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.650
What kind of a crowd do you get in here?

09:34.650 --> 09:37.300
- Mostly locals, Silicon
Valley crop, you know?

09:37.300 --> 09:38.360
Business people.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.430
- What about immoral young
ladies digging for gold?

09:40.430 --> 09:41.320
You get any of those?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.367
- You mean hookers?

09:42.367 --> 09:43.200
- Yeah.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.410
- Yeah, we get those, too.

09:44.410 --> 09:45.243
You looking?

09:47.809 --> 09:48.642
Who's this?

09:48.642 --> 09:49.730
- She's a runaway.

09:49.730 --> 09:51.130
Her daddy's looking for her.

09:52.019 --> 09:53.060
- I don't know, man.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.260
A lot of women go in and out of here.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.410
Can't remember 'em all.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.780
Wait, let me see that.

10:02.534 --> 10:03.367
Hmm.

10:04.914 --> 10:06.600
You know what?

10:06.600 --> 10:09.589
She looks like a girl
that was here last night.

10:09.589 --> 10:10.800
That was a redhead, though.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.740
- A redhead?

10:11.740 --> 10:13.220
- Yeah, she was with a girlfriend.

10:13.220 --> 10:14.750
One of our regulars was hittin' on them.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.380
- Who was that?

10:16.380 --> 10:17.280
- He's a nice guy.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.313
He's the President of the
American Plywood Association.

10:21.460 --> 10:22.310
- You got a name?

10:24.730 --> 10:26.923
- Lakshay, or something like that.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.033
Thank you.

10:36.910 --> 10:39.770
- Finding Mr. Lakshay was easy.

10:39.770 --> 10:40.940
Whoever was visiting him

10:40.940 --> 10:42.767
didn't lock the door on the way out.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.530
- I just want you
to check, because his car's

12:06.530 --> 12:08.660
been parked on the street
for the last two days

12:08.660 --> 12:10.553
and I haven't seen him leaving the home.

12:50.430 --> 12:52.493
- Oh, actually sir, my name is Doron.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.940
Doron in Hebrew means gift from God.

12:56.940 --> 12:57.773
You got that?

13:03.220 --> 13:04.053
No, no, no.

13:04.053 --> 13:06.563
No, no, no, that's not gonna fly.

13:06.563 --> 13:08.753
I'm not going down on the price.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.670
Who cares where they're coming from?

13:15.670 --> 13:17.520
What do you want, birth certificates?

13:19.520 --> 13:21.283
Yeah, I can send you more pictures.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.593
Okay.

13:23.593 --> 13:24.426
Okay, I will.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.340
Cheap son of a bitch.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.890
Okay girls, we're gonna
take more pictures.

13:30.890 --> 13:32.130
Take off your clothes.

13:32.130 --> 13:33.380
He want to see you naked.

13:43.900 --> 13:44.970
- Ms. Morgan?

13:44.970 --> 13:45.840
- Yeah.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.830
- Clyde Cooper, private investigator.

13:47.830 --> 13:49.030
- What's this regarding?

13:54.830 --> 13:56.630
These people are sitting on my sofa?

13:58.760 --> 13:59.593
- Yeah.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.350
Was there anything missing
from your home this morning?

14:04.350 --> 14:06.660
- No, I don't think so.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.440
What did these people do in my house?

14:08.440 --> 14:09.690
- They had an affair.

14:09.690 --> 14:11.610
- They broke into my
house just to have sex?

14:11.610 --> 14:12.770
- They didn't break in.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.260
The woman in the photo, she had a key.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.670
- She had a key?

14:16.670 --> 14:18.760
- She told my client
that this was her home.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.000
- I don't get it.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.290
- Neither do I.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.410
Where were you at the time?

14:22.410 --> 14:25.050
- I was out of town visiting
my sister in Colorado.

14:25.050 --> 14:27.260
- Does anybody else
have a key to your home?

14:27.260 --> 14:28.985
- No, nobody.

14:30.790 --> 14:32.350
- All right, girls.

14:32.350 --> 14:33.660
She's Katyusha.

14:33.660 --> 14:34.860
She will be your driver.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.673
You take it from here.

14:36.673 --> 14:38.283
I check my email.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.643
- Hello, ladies.

14:44.170 --> 14:47.037
My boss is really looking
forward to meeting you.

15:08.805 --> 15:09.967
You're gonna have to put these on

15:09.967 --> 15:11.763
not to damage your wrists.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.583
My boss wants you in mint condition.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.003
Such smooth skin.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.473
Feels like silk.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.760
- Did they hurt you?

15:53.760 --> 15:54.703
- Oh, we're fine.

15:55.810 --> 15:57.060
How did you find us here?

15:57.940 --> 15:58.913
- Piece of cake.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.990
- You're all packed up?

16:05.990 --> 16:07.000
- What's your name?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.592
- Ruggero.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.043
- Hi, Sonya.

16:14.043 --> 16:15.550
- I'm in a motel with a customer.

16:15.550 --> 16:18.540
He wants to know if we could
all get together tonight.

16:18.540 --> 16:19.373
- I don't know.

16:19.373 --> 16:20.363
Which motel are you in?

16:21.360 --> 16:22.730
- No phone calls.

16:22.730 --> 16:23.580
- That was my friend.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.123
- I don't trust your friends.

16:26.630 --> 16:29.420
You're still in a very
dangerous situation, young lady.

16:29.420 --> 16:31.020
Many people are looking for you.

16:41.491 --> 16:42.422
- How you doin'?

16:42.422 --> 16:43.255
- Good.

16:43.255 --> 16:44.487
- How can I help you?

16:44.487 --> 16:45.730
- I have a question.

16:45.730 --> 16:46.610
- Okay.

16:46.610 --> 16:48.930
- Girl locks herself out of her house,

16:48.930 --> 16:50.274
loses her keys.

16:50.274 --> 16:51.107
- Mm-hmm.

16:51.107 --> 16:52.030
- What's the procedure?

16:52.030 --> 16:53.540
- What do you mean, procedure?

16:53.540 --> 16:54.670
- I mean what kind of proof do you need

16:54.670 --> 16:56.223
to let her back into her place?

16:56.223 --> 16:58.010
- I just ask for a photo I.D.

16:58.010 --> 17:01.690
Check her I.D. and go about my business.

17:01.690 --> 17:02.523
- That's it?

17:02.523 --> 17:03.940
- Yeah.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.170
- What if it's a fake I.D.?

17:05.170 --> 17:06.002
- Look, man.

17:06.002 --> 17:07.800
As long as the picture matches the person,

17:07.800 --> 17:08.762
I go ahead with it.

17:10.089 --> 17:10.923
- Okay.

17:14.579 --> 17:15.530
You seen this girl?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.390
- Naw, she doesn't look familiar.

17:18.390 --> 17:19.223
Sorry.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.010
- Have you seen this girl?

17:24.973 --> 17:26.032
- I wish I had.

17:31.610 --> 17:34.150
- No, doesn't look familiar.

17:34.150 --> 17:36.910
Not every day you see a
pretty girl like that.

17:36.910 --> 17:40.330
But I had a customer this
morning who was in her league.

17:40.330 --> 17:41.500
- Really?

17:41.500 --> 17:42.730
What did she want?

17:42.730 --> 17:46.030
- Hmm, lost her keys, locked
herself out of the house.

17:46.030 --> 17:47.250
- You have an address?

17:47.250 --> 17:48.083
- Who is asking?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.460
- Santa Clara Police Department.

17:54.150 --> 17:56.253
- 627 Falcon Street.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.933
Couple of blocks north in Cupertino.

18:00.311 --> 18:02.173
- Thank you.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.340
It looks like there's another girl in town

18:06.340 --> 18:09.100
with the same M.O. as Vincent's girl,

18:09.100 --> 18:12.360
and she just moved in,
into somebody's house.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.420
- So, when are we gonna
get the new passports?

18:14.420 --> 18:16.010
- Somebody's workin' on it.

18:16.010 --> 18:17.480
Where are you now?

18:17.480 --> 18:19.160
- Just found a new safe house.

18:19.160 --> 18:19.993
- Oh, yeah?

18:19.993 --> 18:20.826
For how long?

18:20.826 --> 18:22.010
- Two weeks.

18:22.010 --> 18:24.440
The owners are on vacation in Europe.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.100
- Good job, girlfriend.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.960
- I gotta find me somebody.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.793
I need money.

18:28.793 --> 18:30.508
I really need money.

18:32.740 --> 18:34.220
Well, I...

18:34.220 --> 18:35.770
I will, absolutely.

18:35.770 --> 18:37.083
No, of course, yes.

18:38.470 --> 18:39.523
- Ms. Alexa Smith?

18:40.450 --> 18:41.370
- Yes.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.920
- Tom Armstrong, Santa
Clara Fire Department.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.080
- Someone is at the door.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.330
I'll call you right back.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.670
What is this regarding?

18:49.560 --> 18:50.630
- Well, your house is scheduled

18:50.630 --> 18:52.430
for a fire safety inspection, ma'am.

18:53.610 --> 18:54.443
- Okay.

18:55.620 --> 18:56.453
Come right in.

18:56.453 --> 18:57.286
- Thank you.

19:08.993 --> 19:12.040
When was the last time you
had your sprinklers inspected?

19:12.040 --> 19:12.873
I'm gonna have to take a look

19:12.873 --> 19:15.080
at your inspection certificate.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.820
- I don't remember where I put it.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.440
- That could be a serious problem.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.490
- Every problem has a
solution, Mr. Armstrong.

19:21.490 --> 19:22.800
Would you care for a drink?

19:22.800 --> 19:23.633
- Sure.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.153
- Scotch okay?

19:31.190 --> 19:32.023
- It's fine.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.550
You mind if I take a
look around your kitchen?

19:37.550 --> 19:38.383
- Why?

19:38.383 --> 19:40.543
- Because most fires start in the kitchen.

19:43.370 --> 19:45.822
Not that that should concern you,

19:45.822 --> 19:47.030
because you're so hot, you could probably

19:47.030 --> 19:48.573
start a fire anywhere.

19:49.770 --> 19:52.550
- For a fire inspector, that's
a pretty good pickup line.

19:52.550 --> 19:53.663
- I practice daily.

19:54.550 --> 19:56.110
- You must meet a lot of lonely women

19:56.110 --> 19:57.320
on your inspection tours.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.690
- Don't tell me you're lonely.

19:58.690 --> 19:59.523
- Why?

20:01.630 --> 20:03.040
- It would take an army of bodyguards

20:03.040 --> 20:04.980
to keep a girl like you lonely.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.423
- You're really good at this.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.740
- Cheers.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.890
- Cheers.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.963
What is your best pickup line?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.690
- You're so gorgeous,
I'd drink your bathwater.

20:18.690 --> 20:20.290
- You wanna take a bath with me?

20:26.525 --> 20:28.430
- Get over there.

20:44.950 --> 20:47.033
- That was not in the cards.

20:48.090 --> 20:50.060
I was digging this chick.

20:50.060 --> 20:53.223
These morons interrupted
a very nice conversation.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.300
The way it was going,

20:56.300 --> 20:59.150
I'd have had good news for
Vincent by the end of the day.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.423
And maybe even found true love myself.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.183
But that would be too
much luck in one day.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.560
- You have
reached Paradise Inn Motel.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.510
If you know your party's
room number, dial it now.

21:55.510 --> 21:58.073
Otherwise, dial zero for the front desk.

22:08.390 --> 22:09.660
- Hello, Alexa?

22:09.660 --> 22:11.710
- Hello, this is John Hooper.

22:11.710 --> 22:14.170
I'm doing a customer satisfaction survey

22:14.170 --> 22:16.470
for the Paradise Inn Motels.

22:16.470 --> 22:17.650
May I have your name, please?

22:17.650 --> 22:18.483
- No.

22:28.510 --> 22:31.100
- I drove to Santa
Clara to see Julie Baldwin.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.780
She was a technician
at San Jose crime lab,

22:33.780 --> 22:34.880
and a pretty good one.

22:41.890 --> 22:44.702
- She let you take a video of her?

22:44.702 --> 22:45.613
- I used my bodycam.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.920
- Are you trying to make me jealous now?

22:55.920 --> 22:57.980
- Trying to get you involved.

22:57.980 --> 22:59.543
See the glass in her hand?

23:01.183 --> 23:03.083
- Yeah, what about it?

23:04.330 --> 23:06.270
- I want you to lift the
fingerprints off of it

23:06.270 --> 23:07.420
and run a check for me.

23:33.690 --> 23:34.523
Hi, buddy.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.380
- How can I help?

23:37.380 --> 23:39.000
- What do you have in room 12?

23:39.000 --> 23:39.900
- Can't tell you.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.323
- You can't or you won't?

23:51.920 --> 23:52.920
- Private detective?

23:55.210 --> 23:56.693
Your guy's name is David.

23:58.990 --> 23:59.960
There was a woman with him.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.540
I don't know her name.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.433
They just left.

24:05.650 --> 24:07.623
- They checked out, or.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.260
- They didn't check out.

24:11.260 --> 24:12.360
They'll be back later.

24:28.870 --> 24:29.703
- Hello?

24:36.400 --> 24:37.233
You okay?

24:38.350 --> 24:40.093
- I need to recharge.

24:42.150 --> 24:42.983
- Excuse me?

24:45.360 --> 24:46.690
- I don't feel good.

24:56.290 --> 24:59.610
- Now, if that were a
.45, I wouldn't argue,

24:59.610 --> 25:02.510
but with a .22, I think a man
could get in a couple words.

25:07.690 --> 25:10.250
- Down on the floor.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.210
- Don't forget, you're a lady.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.893
- I said, on the floor.

25:15.432 --> 25:17.133
- I like that perfume.

25:17.133 --> 25:18.673
What is that?

25:23.185 --> 25:24.435
- Wake up.

25:24.435 --> 25:25.964
Come on.

25:25.964 --> 25:26.797
Come on.

25:28.046 --> 25:28.879
Quickly.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.560
- Snooping around motel rooms

26:32.560 --> 26:34.900
is a bloody business, ain't it?

26:34.900 --> 26:36.593
- What kind of car were they driving?

26:37.750 --> 26:38.583
- 40.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.270
- You work hard for your money.

26:56.610 --> 26:58.880
I liked the blonde with the zapper.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.763
She seemed to be a principle
player in our little drama.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.120
It looked like I was dealing
with a network of hookers

27:05.120 --> 27:06.913
and she was top banana.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.710
The hardest part of it all was,

27:10.710 --> 27:13.180
how am I gonna break this to Vincent?

27:13.180 --> 27:16.253
How do I tell the man that the
love of his life is a hooker?

27:18.380 --> 27:20.390
Or maybe she's not a hooker.

27:20.390 --> 27:22.500
Maybe she's at the early stage of hooking

27:22.500 --> 27:25.350
where a young girl's foolishness
becomes a form of grace.

27:26.290 --> 27:28.560
Or maybe she's just a beautiful sociopath

27:28.560 --> 27:31.450
who made Vincent lose his focus.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.850
One thing about this type of woman,

27:33.850 --> 27:36.013
they always make you lose your focus.

27:54.330 --> 27:57.593
- We processed the glass
for fingerprints and look.

27:59.440 --> 28:00.860
- What the hell is this?

28:00.860 --> 28:02.990
- These prints are not human.

28:02.990 --> 28:04.963
They have a silkscreen pattern.

28:06.460 --> 28:08.520
- The girl was perfectly human.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.663
- Well, maybe she was, but
her fingerprints were not.

28:13.170 --> 28:15.120
What did you get yourself into, Cooper?

28:18.718 --> 28:19.551
- I don't know.

28:21.290 --> 28:23.223
What did you get on that
license plate I gave you?

28:25.039 --> 28:28.080
- It belongs to a Loretta Berman.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.840
1289 Valley Oak, Cupertino.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.070
She works for the Peach Corporation.

28:33.070 --> 28:33.930
- Peach Corporation?

28:33.930 --> 28:35.140
- Mm-hmm.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.280
- What's her position?

28:36.280 --> 28:37.960
- Well, the company website lists her

28:37.960 --> 28:40.798
as the director of the
marketing department.

28:58.419 --> 28:59.252
- Yes?

29:03.190 --> 29:04.820
- I'm looking for Mrs. Loretta Berman.

29:04.820 --> 29:06.040
- And you are?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.110
- Clyde Cooper.

29:07.110 --> 29:08.173
- Do you have an appointment?

29:08.173 --> 29:10.960
- No, but I'm pretty sure
she's dying to see me.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.550
- What makes you so sure?

29:12.550 --> 29:14.280
- We met at a motel yesterday.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.102
She showed me her dark side.

29:16.102 --> 29:16.935
- Really?

29:18.270 --> 29:20.550
- Has anyone ever told you
you have a gorgeous smile?

29:20.550 --> 29:22.880
- Please. You think you're
so hip you can talk your way

29:22.880 --> 29:24.603
into a safe deposit box?

29:27.110 --> 29:30.490
Take your foot out or I'm
gonna show you my dark side.

29:30.490 --> 29:31.560
- Take me to Loretta Berman

29:31.560 --> 29:33.710
and you can show me
whatever side you want.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.273
- Cooper.

30:10.740 --> 30:12.300
- Mr. Snooper.

30:12.300 --> 30:14.360
I was hoping not to see you again.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.210
Thank you, Sarah.

30:17.770 --> 30:20.590
What brings you here, Detective?

30:20.590 --> 30:22.100
- How'd you know I was a detective?

30:22.100 --> 30:23.720
- From the motel receptionist.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.690
- Ah.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.470
He was milking you, too.

30:26.470 --> 30:27.320
- Sure.

30:28.290 --> 30:29.140
- You like Klimt.

30:30.090 --> 30:30.923
- I do.

30:32.010 --> 30:33.606
One of my favorite painters.

30:33.606 --> 30:36.710
- Well, I'm pretty sure you
and I are gonna be friends.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.261
- Are you coming on to me, Mr. Cooper?

30:38.261 --> 30:39.094
- No.

30:39.094 --> 30:41.690
I just seem to get along
with women who like Klimt.

30:41.690 --> 30:42.523
- So do I.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.133
What do you want?

30:50.668 --> 30:52.591
- Have you seen this woman?

31:04.743 --> 31:06.543
A client of mine is looking for her.

31:07.980 --> 31:10.060
- And you think there's
some connection between

31:10.060 --> 31:11.940
her and the guy at the motel?

31:11.940 --> 31:13.440
- She has the same M.O. as a girl

31:13.440 --> 31:15.820
by the name of Alexa Smith.

31:15.820 --> 31:18.890
And Alexa's friends with
that girl in the motel.

31:18.890 --> 31:20.530
I need to speak to her.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.570
- I'm afraid you can't.

31:21.570 --> 31:22.403
- Why's that?

31:22.403 --> 31:23.373
- My lawyer's advice.

31:26.100 --> 31:29.643
I'm divorcing my husband and
that girl is my star witness.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.960
I can't have her reputation tainted.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.430
- She seemed pretty
intoxicated in that motel.

31:35.430 --> 31:37.460
Was she under any heavy drugs?

31:37.460 --> 31:38.293
- No comment.

31:40.940 --> 31:41.850
- Where is she?

31:41.850 --> 31:43.360
- That's none of your business.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.043
- Actually, this is my business.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.333
- Okay.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.053
Then I want to hire you.

31:56.053 --> 31:58.130
- For what?

31:58.130 --> 32:00.010
- To steer your snooping
in another direction.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.670
- Can't do that.

32:01.670 --> 32:02.503
- Come on.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.463
Everybody has a price.

32:06.430 --> 32:07.263
- Yeah.

32:10.800 --> 32:11.963
Reputation, too.

32:13.190 --> 32:14.023
- All right.

32:15.740 --> 32:18.670
What do I have to do to
get you out of my hair?

32:18.670 --> 32:20.920
- You put me in touch with that girl.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.500
- I told you I can't.

32:22.500 --> 32:26.573
- That's too bad 'cause I can
be a real pain in the ass.

32:27.920 --> 32:28.803
- So can I.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.520
- Yeah, essentially, we
started from scratch.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.580
You should've seen it a month ago.

32:44.580 --> 32:45.700
- It's a nice space.

32:45.700 --> 32:46.533
- Uh-huh.

32:46.533 --> 32:47.943
It's gonna be my new office.

32:49.430 --> 32:50.280
- Who's the girl?

32:51.330 --> 32:53.053
- That's my assistant Claudia.

32:55.090 --> 32:56.303
- Now, about Denise.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.620
Did you notice anything unusual about her?

32:59.620 --> 33:00.453
- Like what?

33:01.476 --> 33:03.530
- Well, I'm assuming you
slept with her, right?

33:03.530 --> 33:04.923
- Yeah, so?

33:05.920 --> 33:07.480
- I'm checking out this other girl.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.833
Cut from the same cloth.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.410
Ran her fingerprints and I came up with

33:11.410 --> 33:14.070
some strange silkscreen pattern.

33:14.070 --> 33:15.330
- No kidding.

33:15.330 --> 33:17.330
Plastic surgery's gotten that far, huh?

33:17.330 --> 33:19.310
- I don't think this is plastic surgery.

33:19.310 --> 33:20.200
- Trust me.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.030
I know two guys that can do magic.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.750
I'll ask them about
that silkscreen pattern.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.250
- Um, Mr. Donovan.

33:27.250 --> 33:28.373
I apologize.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.250
The landlord can't come until later,

33:31.250 --> 33:32.720
so I'm going to get some lunch.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.110
Would you like a sandwich?

33:34.110 --> 33:35.776
- Sure. What kind of
sandwich

33:35.776 --> 33:37.407
is the least fattening?

33:37.407 --> 33:38.240
- A half sandwich?

33:38.240 --> 33:39.880
- The usual salad.

33:39.880 --> 33:40.713
- Clyde Cooper.

33:43.170 --> 33:44.020
Of course.

33:44.020 --> 33:44.853
On my way.

33:50.160 --> 33:54.010
Vincent was a perfect example
of how blind love can be.

33:54.010 --> 33:56.110
He could've dated an
alien from outer space

33:56.110 --> 33:57.780
and think her fingerprints were

33:57.780 --> 33:59.983
the newest fad in plastic surgery.

34:00.890 --> 34:03.743
In fact, what he was saying
to me was fuck the truth.

34:04.600 --> 34:08.427
But in cases like this,
the truth fucks you.

34:13.690 --> 34:16.143
- Ah, PI Cooper.

34:17.270 --> 34:18.480
That was fast.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.203
- I didn't do more than 90.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.409
- We checked his cell phone

34:23.730 --> 34:26.409
and your number was in the recents.

34:26.409 --> 34:28.469
Your business card was in his pocket.

34:28.469 --> 34:29.840
- Am I a suspect?

34:29.840 --> 34:31.120
- No, not really.

34:31.120 --> 34:36.120
But let me just ask one of these
umbrella questions, Cooper.

34:36.489 --> 34:38.400
Just to set the stage.

34:38.400 --> 34:42.114
Would you say you were
strictly legal in this picture?

34:42.114 --> 34:43.150
- You know me, Frank.

34:43.150 --> 34:45.310
I just paid the guy for some information.

34:45.310 --> 34:46.177
- How much?

34:46.177 --> 34:47.344
- 160.

34:48.179 --> 34:49.402
- His wallet was empty.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.530
- How'd he die?

34:52.530 --> 34:54.100
- Ah, it's hard to tell.

34:54.100 --> 34:57.633
This whole setup is supposed
to make me think he overdosed,

34:58.810 --> 35:01.075
but I wouldn't rule out homicide.

35:01.075 --> 35:02.760
- Why's that?

35:02.760 --> 35:03.660
- Look at his arm.

35:05.790 --> 35:08.797
Does that look like a
shot of heroin to you?

35:12.780 --> 35:15.590
- The police were
trying to cover all bases,

35:15.590 --> 35:18.053
but I personally thought
the guy just overdosed.

35:18.890 --> 35:22.000
Last night, he scored
a nice chunk of cash.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.900
It was reasonable to assume he
bought a shitload of whatever

35:24.900 --> 35:26.250
and pumped it into his arm.

36:14.090 --> 36:15.970
The receptionist is dead.

36:15.970 --> 36:17.440
- How did he die?

36:17.440 --> 36:18.930
- He was murdered.

36:18.930 --> 36:19.763
Execution style.

36:25.799 --> 36:27.010
- How do you know this?

36:27.010 --> 36:29.550
- Detective Frank Barrett
is an acquaintance of mine.

36:29.550 --> 36:31.750
Called me in as a person of interest.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.540
Receptionist had my number.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.860
- What did you tell them?

36:34.860 --> 36:35.693
- The truth.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.003
They're gonna be contacting you, too.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.500
We gotta make sure we're on the same page

36:43.500 --> 36:45.770
because if our stories don't match

36:45.770 --> 36:47.520
we're gonna be in a king-size jam.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.420
- Thanks for keeping me in the loop.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.217
- You're welcome.

41:21.777 --> 41:22.610
Hey!

42:39.603 --> 42:40.436
Shit.

43:10.410 --> 43:11.680
Good brakes.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.670
- What the hell are you doing?

43:13.670 --> 43:14.750
- I'm trying to hitch a ride.

43:14.750 --> 43:15.890
- Rolling in front of my car?

43:15.890 --> 43:16.920
- I have an emergency.

43:16.920 --> 43:17.760
- What emergency?

43:17.760 --> 43:18.930
- I have a plane to catch.

43:18.930 --> 43:19.960
- A plane?

43:19.960 --> 43:21.433
- About five miles up the road.

43:23.920 --> 43:24.903
- Okay, hop in.

43:36.570 --> 43:37.412
- Step on it.

43:37.412 --> 43:38.245
- Okay.

43:48.450 --> 43:49.800
- Fuck.

43:56.060 --> 43:57.977
- You missed the plane?

44:00.090 --> 44:01.290
Do you need a ride back?

44:02.650 --> 44:03.523
- Yes, please.

44:06.850 --> 44:07.960
What was your name?

44:07.960 --> 44:09.620
- I'm Bobbi.

44:09.620 --> 44:12.470
- Bobbi, you're a gem.

44:12.470 --> 44:13.303
- Thanks.

44:29.290 --> 44:32.423
By the time I got back to
my office it was nine p.m.

44:33.670 --> 44:36.123
Time for a drink and meditation.

44:37.730 --> 44:39.553
I had to congratulate myself.

44:40.830 --> 44:43.513
I just won the award for
biggest idiot in town.

44:45.330 --> 44:47.710
While I was having my tires replaced,

44:47.710 --> 44:49.913
I called Public Records at City Hall.

44:51.120 --> 44:54.543
I found out that Loretta Berman
had never filed for divorce.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.833
She was married to a woman named Sarah.

44:59.180 --> 45:01.270
The woman who met me at the door

45:01.270 --> 45:04.043
in the red dress and killer heels.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.043
- Mr. Clyde Cooper?

45:21.430 --> 45:22.420
- Who are you?

45:22.420 --> 45:23.603
- They call me Ruggero.

45:25.530 --> 45:28.750
I came to collect a set
of car keys you stole

45:28.750 --> 45:30.353
from an associate of mine.

45:31.220 --> 45:32.473
The undertaker.

45:41.260 --> 45:44.533
I gotta tell you, I'm a bad motherfucker.

45:45.820 --> 45:48.515
- Does your mother know
what you do for a living?

45:59.460 --> 46:00.760
- The bookshelf was cheap,

46:01.740 --> 46:04.103
but the door's gonna set you back $280.

46:06.690 --> 46:07.663
- Don't get jumpy.

46:08.870 --> 46:10.610
I heard you're a cool cat.

46:10.610 --> 46:12.340
- You heard wrong.

46:12.340 --> 46:13.903
I go to pieces over nothing.

46:16.260 --> 46:18.410
- I have a nice little
proposition for you.

46:19.700 --> 46:21.640
May I reach into my pocket?

46:21.640 --> 46:23.600
- Don't pull out a gun.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.100
I'd hate to kill you before
you pay for that door.

46:29.122 --> 46:32.207
- A thousand dollars for
doing nothing at all.

46:34.290 --> 46:37.270
And if you continue to do
nothing for the next few days,

46:37.270 --> 46:39.513
I'll come back and give
you another thousand.

46:45.940 --> 46:48.400
- And for who am I doing
all this nothing for?

46:48.400 --> 46:49.233
Hmm?

46:50.910 --> 46:51.960
Loretta Berman?

46:51.960 --> 46:52.793
- Loretta who?

46:54.480 --> 46:57.150
- Loretta Berman, Peach Corporation.

46:57.150 --> 46:58.270
- Never heard of her.

46:58.270 --> 46:59.220
- Who's your boss?

46:59.220 --> 47:01.570
- A man who would rather
spill money than blood.

47:01.570 --> 47:04.530
But he's also a man who
does not mind spilling blood

47:04.530 --> 47:06.173
if he has no other choice.

47:11.140 --> 47:14.090
- You tell Mr. Blood Spiller
I have a conflict of interest.

47:17.180 --> 47:18.630
- You'll regret this, Cooper.

47:19.550 --> 47:21.700
If you manage to live
that long, of course.

47:24.220 --> 47:25.543
I'm sure we'll meet again.

47:39.460 --> 47:41.240
- Uh, who the hell was that?

47:41.240 --> 47:43.628
- Small fish acting like a big fish.

47:43.628 --> 47:44.461
What are you doing here?

47:44.461 --> 47:46.303
- I was passing by.

47:48.820 --> 47:50.780
Any progress finding my girl?

47:50.780 --> 47:52.089
- I'm working on it.

47:53.500 --> 47:54.743
- I miss her, Cooper.

47:56.030 --> 48:00.380
Last night, staring at the
ceiling thinking about her,

48:00.380 --> 48:02.660
I couldn't close my eyes.

48:02.660 --> 48:04.483
I have such vivid memories.

48:06.020 --> 48:07.393
I cannot sleep.

48:09.060 --> 48:10.690
I think I'm possessed.

48:10.690 --> 48:12.021
- I can see that.

48:12.021 --> 48:12.871
You want a drink?

48:14.410 --> 48:15.243
- No.

48:16.780 --> 48:18.070
Tell me you have something.

48:18.070 --> 48:19.603
Give me a glimmer of hope.

48:21.370 --> 48:22.620
- Well, I have something.

48:24.750 --> 48:26.003
I wouldn't call it hope.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.910
- Good looking girls.

48:35.910 --> 48:37.663
What about 'em?

48:37.663 --> 48:39.663
- They're all wearing the same necklace.

48:40.794 --> 48:41.835
- Oh, yeah.

48:49.154 --> 48:51.196
- He better give me my money back!

48:51.196 --> 48:52.716
I'll find him!

48:52.716 --> 48:54.997
I'll peel his skin back!

48:54.997 --> 48:56.664
I'll break his legs!

49:05.127 --> 49:06.320
- Ah, Cooper.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.150
You got my message.

49:08.150 --> 49:09.160
Okay, folks.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.350
I'll talk to you later.

49:10.350 --> 49:11.250
- We'll talk soon.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.000
- What's this about?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.480
- You're in deep shit, pal.

49:19.480 --> 49:22.170
The chief wants to suspend your license

49:22.170 --> 49:23.703
and throw you in the slammer.

49:24.620 --> 49:25.453
Follow me.

49:31.650 --> 49:32.483
Come here.

49:33.960 --> 49:34.793
Sit down.

49:42.490 --> 49:44.090
What do you know about that guy?

49:45.720 --> 49:46.553
- Nothing.

49:47.760 --> 49:51.170
- That guy had a hidden camera
in the front of his house

49:51.170 --> 49:52.733
and it shows you going in.

49:54.380 --> 49:55.353
Why are you lying to me, Cooper?

49:55.353 --> 49:57.440
- Because if I told you
what I was doing there,

49:57.440 --> 49:58.870
you'd ask me to write a book about

49:58.870 --> 50:00.130
what I was doing in there.

50:00.130 --> 50:01.800
- Instead of writing a book,

50:01.800 --> 50:04.740
why don't you give me a good synopsis.

50:04.740 --> 50:06.490
And try to focus on the hookers

50:06.490 --> 50:08.680
that you've been dealing with.

50:08.680 --> 50:11.020
The hookers are on the camera, also.

50:11.020 --> 50:14.160
Walking out of the house
with the dead man's iPad.

50:14.160 --> 50:15.630
- I'm not dealing with them, Frank.

50:15.630 --> 50:16.840
I'm looking for one of 'em.

50:16.840 --> 50:19.380
She goes by the name of Denise Morgan.

50:19.380 --> 50:21.213
Although, I'd bet that's
not her real name.

50:26.688 --> 50:29.080
- Is that her?

50:29.080 --> 50:30.920
- Yeah. Although, in
all the pics I've seen of her,

50:30.920 --> 50:32.820
she's wearing a blonde or a red wig.

50:32.820 --> 50:35.830
- Well, we found this
video on Lakshay's phone.

50:35.830 --> 50:37.930
And it was sent to him from a burner.

50:37.930 --> 50:39.990
- You think it's
organized prostitution?

50:39.990 --> 50:41.960
- Well, it sure smells like it.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.690
So you better keep me posted

50:43.690 --> 50:45.383
if you want to stay out of jail.

50:46.700 --> 50:48.017
The chief isn't kidding, you know?

50:48.017 --> 50:49.340
- Cut the bullshit, Frank.

50:49.340 --> 50:50.650
If the chief wanted me arrested,

50:50.650 --> 50:52.900
you wouldn't be talking to me in here.

50:52.900 --> 50:54.240
So why don't you just tell me the truth?

50:54.240 --> 50:56.870
That organized prostitution
is an embarrassment

50:56.870 --> 50:59.630
for the department and you'd
like for me to help you out.

50:59.630 --> 51:02.209
- That's what I just said, didn't I?

51:02.209 --> 51:03.042
- There you go.

51:04.180 --> 51:05.330
I'll see what I can do.

51:06.660 --> 51:10.860
By the way, this Lakshay guy.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.000
Why'd he do himself in?

51:12.000 --> 51:14.490
- According to his doctor
he was a sex addict

51:14.490 --> 51:17.130
with a bad case of chronic impotence.

51:17.130 --> 51:20.063
So he put himself out of his misery.

51:23.860 --> 51:26.410
- Online you can
dig up all kinds of dirt.

51:26.410 --> 51:29.350
All kinds of pimps who
sell all kinds of meat.

51:29.350 --> 51:33.490
Some of them have fancy names
like Exotic Escorts Agency.

51:33.490 --> 51:36.000
Some others just use proxies.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.507
Smooth operators like Loretta Berman.

53:36.320 --> 53:37.320
- Meow-meow.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.423
- Meow-meow to you.

53:42.661 --> 53:44.140
- Who are you?

53:44.140 --> 53:44.973
- Clyde Cooper.

53:44.973 --> 53:46.310
Who are you?

53:46.310 --> 53:47.470
- I'm me.

53:47.470 --> 53:49.231
- What's your name?

53:49.231 --> 53:50.064
- Raya.

53:50.064 --> 53:51.563
- You from around here, Raya?

53:53.630 --> 53:55.820
- Yeah, around here.

53:55.820 --> 53:56.653
- Me, too.

53:57.780 --> 53:59.470
Where'd you go to school?

54:01.539 --> 54:04.372
- I don't want to talk about that.

54:09.860 --> 54:11.600
- You have beautiful hands.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.900
- You like my hands?

54:12.900 --> 54:13.860
- I do.

54:15.260 --> 54:16.093
Let me see 'em.

54:23.153 --> 54:24.493
Such soft skin.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.220
Fingertips like silk.

54:30.180 --> 54:31.670
- You like the feel of my skin?

54:31.670 --> 54:32.503
- I do.

54:38.640 --> 54:40.800
Tell me more about yourself.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.464
- What do you want to know?

54:42.464 --> 54:45.310
- Do you know Loretta Berman?

54:45.310 --> 54:46.143
- I do.

54:47.660 --> 54:51.620
She owns this house, but she
doesn't really care about it.

54:51.620 --> 54:52.453
So.

54:53.290 --> 54:54.760
- So you're house sitting?

54:54.760 --> 54:55.593
- I love her.

54:55.593 --> 54:56.573
- In what way?

54:57.750 --> 54:59.427
- Do you know what love is?

54:59.427 --> 55:00.260
- Yeah.

55:01.307 --> 55:03.307
- That's how I love her.

55:04.308 --> 55:06.760
- You must miss her.

55:06.760 --> 55:07.593
- Not really.

55:09.100 --> 55:10.393
I'm a professional lover.

55:11.983 --> 55:14.739
- It's a lovely profession.

56:21.893 --> 56:23.143
- Where'd she go?

56:25.140 --> 56:26.223
- She's over there.

57:09.257 --> 57:10.090
- Fuck!

59:09.700 --> 59:10.580
- I told you.

59:10.580 --> 59:12.919
I have no idea where Alexa is.

59:12.919 --> 59:15.440
- Then you wait
here until she shows up.

59:15.440 --> 59:17.820
- You said you'd find me a passport.

59:17.820 --> 59:19.430
Where is it?

59:19.430 --> 59:22.193
- I'm not giving it to you
unless Alexa comes with you.

59:23.068 --> 59:24.920
- You son of a bitch.

59:24.920 --> 59:26.590
Give me that passport.

59:26.590 --> 59:28.260
- Where'd you get that gun?

59:28.260 --> 59:29.920
Put that gun away.

59:29.920 --> 59:32.270
- Give me the
passport or I'll kill you.

01:00:05.838 --> 01:00:06.671
- Ruggero.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.853
Long time.

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:11.883
- Oh.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.423
So it's you again.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.573
I told you to stay away from all this.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.150
- Hard of hearing.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.130
Turn around.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:22.010
Put your hands up.

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.800
- You're on the wrong
side of the table, Cooper.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.410
- That's too bad.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.403
It's my best side.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.520
- I feel sorry for you.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.693
You make me sad.

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:34.940
Real sad.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.423
- Buy yourself some flowers.

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:39.882
Turn around.

01:00:39.882 --> 01:00:42.190
- You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:43.980
- I have imagination.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.753
Turn around and put your hands up.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.450
Peach Corporation is
running a prostitution ring.

01:02:24.548 --> 01:02:26.298
And you're the madam.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.560
That's a hell of a poker face,

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.683
but you're playing with a
marked deck, sweetheart.

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:38.260
- You know, you really shouldn't put us

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.760
on a collision course, Cooper.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.130
You'll regret it.

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:51.003
- It's clear to me that
you knew this girl.

01:02:53.152 --> 01:02:56.550
But you didn't ask me how she was

01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:59.133
or where she was for that matter.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.392
- Well, because.

01:03:01.392 --> 01:03:02.892
- Because you knew she's dead.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.473
What did you do with the other girls?

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.010
- You're just a private snoop.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.733
You don't have the
authority for any of this.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:27.970
Where are you going?

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.530
- I'm going to go speak
to Detective Frank Barrett

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:35.380
of the Santa Clara Police Department.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.740
He's got all the authority I need.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.120
Hello?

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.120
- Do you still want to go to the police?

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.060
I'm so not who you think I am, Cooper.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.690
- And who exactly would that be?

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:26.430
- Maybe one day you'll find out.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.610
- Why do I get the feeling
that you need my services?

01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:30.130
- They seem to be beneficial.

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:31.210
- And what would they be so I can

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.390
be specific on the invoice?

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:36.710
- Just do what you have to
do, but keep me in the loop.

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:37.543
That's all.

01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:02.680
- Hey there, partner.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.190
Welcome to my place.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:05.140
How can I help you?

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.460
- Looking for Charlie.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.293
- Charlie?

01:05:09.293 --> 01:05:11.380
Last time I checked I'm Charlie, man.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.320
What can I do for you here?

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.670
- A friend of mine told me you
specialize in US passports.

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:17.060
- Which friend is that?

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:17.893
- Ruggero.

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:20.500
- I'm listening.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.230
- He told me you were
working a couple passports

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.530
for some high-end hookers.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:27.450
Last night, he texted you
to cancel one of them?

01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:28.780
- How'd you know that?

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.130
- I saw a text on his
phone after I killed him.

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.890
Where are the passports?

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:35.900
- Look, man.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.221
I don't know about any
passports, all right?

01:05:37.221 --> 01:05:38.054
- Where are the passports?

01:05:38.054 --> 01:05:39.360
- I don't know anything
about any passports.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.510
- Let's try this again.

01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:46.550
Where are the passports?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.190
- I gave them to the other guy, okay?

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:51.033
- What other guy?
- I gave 'em to George.

01:05:51.033 --> 01:05:52.450
He's with Electronics.

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.420
- George in Electronics.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.253
- Yeah.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:55.993
- Great place.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.710
Vincent, Cooper here.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:03.193
I think I know where your girl is.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.643
- Can I help you?

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.790
- I'm looking for George Hoffman.

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:23.780
- He's not here at the moment,
but he'll be back soon.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.800
- I really need to speak to him.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.350
- You can wait for him in the office.

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:29.183
Come in.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.663
This is Nina.

01:07:06.721 --> 01:07:09.930
- I thought your name
was Denise, not Nina.

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.610
- Oh, have we met before?

01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:14.187
- Vincent's looking for you,

01:07:14.187 --> 01:07:16.260
but he said your name was Denise.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.350
- It was, but now I'm Nina.

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:19.500
- Why's that?

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.833
- My passport says so.

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.770
- Where are you traveling to?

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:33.480
- We're leaving for Hong
Kong in a few hours.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.940
- What's going on in Hong Kong?

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.580
- George said he was going to introduce us

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.860
to some very important people there.

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.283
- They're called VIPs.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.270
- What is this behind your head?

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:52.760
- Oh, that's my charging cord.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.493
I have to get fully charged
before we get on the plane.

01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:59.410
- May I have a look?

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:00.243
- Sure.

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.003
What?

01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:15.850
- Are you a robot?

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:16.683
- Uh-huh.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.420
- You, too?

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.292
- Yes.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:28.343
- And you were created
by the Peach Corporation?

01:08:43.477 --> 01:08:47.200
And I was afraid to tell
Vincent his girl was a hooker.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.743
Now I have to tell him she's a robot, too?

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:54.252
Come to think of it,
they must all be robots.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:58.162
Alexa, Sonya, Raya.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:00.153
All of them.

01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:03.693
Appliances made in Silicon Valley.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.529
And Loretta, she must be the one in charge

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:08.593
of the product line.

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:10.633
Keeping it secret.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.843
Now, some smartass figured he
can sell these dolls overseas.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.120
Peach Corporation must have a very

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.553
lousy security department.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:21.403
What happened?

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.210
Did you escape?

01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:25.042
- We ran away.

01:09:25.042 --> 01:09:26.260
We didn't like it there.

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.069
- You're George's girlfriend, right?

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:29.029
- Yes.

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:30.340
- Did he know you're a robot?

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.790
- Yes, I told him the
first day we were together.

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:35.510
- Did Vincent know you're a robot?

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:36.899
- No, I never told him.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:37.733
- Why's that?

01:09:37.733 --> 01:09:38.810
- He never asked.

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:39.750
- Why'd you leave him?

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:43.090
- Oh, because I like to be with Gaya.

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:44.670
And also because George introduced me

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:46.029
to some of his other friends.

01:09:46.029 --> 01:09:47.060
- Where'd you meet these friends?

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.120
- Hotels, motels.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.149
- Did they know you're a robot?

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:52.460
- Stop calling me a robot.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.160
I hate this word, it's so demeaning.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.040
- We have personalities, you know.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.450
- I'm sure you do.

01:09:57.450 --> 01:09:58.750
Did you meet these friends, too?

01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:59.583
- Oh, yes.

01:09:59.583 --> 01:10:01.560
We made love to all of them.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.760
- We're designed to make love.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.593
- Are you?

01:10:04.593 --> 01:10:05.426
- Yes.

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.760
We can make love to you too if you like.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.713
- Oh, we're extremely good lovers.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.770
- What else are you designed to do?

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.603
- Nothing.

01:10:38.439 --> 01:10:40.023
All we can do is make love.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.523
- Sorry, ladies.

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:46.690
This is way past my kink zone.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.360
So, who are these VIPs in Hong Kong?

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.350
- World-class experts.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:00.050
They'll teach us whatever we want.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:02.950
- Yes, we want to learn other things.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:05.760
That's why George is
taking us to Hong Kong.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.710
- I don't think so.

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:12.360
- What do you mean?

01:11:13.274 --> 01:11:14.674
- I'll tell you what I mean.

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:20.900
When you arrive in Hong Kong,

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.180
George will most likely sell
you to the highest bidder.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.580
They're gonna put you
on a table, open you up,

01:11:27.495 --> 01:11:30.170
and see what the Peach
engineers put inside you.

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:31.083
- How do you know?

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.880
- I'm a fortune teller.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.150
- What is a fortune teller?

01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:37.960
- A man who can tell
what's gonna happen to you.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.690
- Hmm, that sounds sexy.

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:42.120
- We'll be there in one hour, all right?

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.520
So, what I need you to do...

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.233
What the hell's going on here?

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:54.180
- Not a smart way to
approach an armed man.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.153
- Okay, no problem.

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:06.653
- Hey, wake up.

01:12:07.636 --> 01:12:08.603
Wake up, come on.

01:12:11.676 --> 01:12:12.776
What the fuck is this?

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.633
What is this?

01:12:14.633 --> 01:12:15.530
- It's a bodycam.

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:16.780
- What's it recording on?

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:18.800
- The cloud.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.300
- What's the fucking password?

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.153
What was that?

01:12:26.153 --> 01:12:27.560
I couldn't hear you.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.762
What, you need a little help?

01:12:32.163 --> 01:12:33.163
This fucking gadget.

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:35.190
How about one more, huh?

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:36.440
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:39.270
- What's the password?

01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.380
- I'll give it to you.

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.213
- What is it?

01:12:41.213 --> 01:12:42.046
- You need a pen.

01:12:42.046 --> 01:12:42.879
It's complicated.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:49.933
- Let's go.

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:51.853
- One,

01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:54.534
two,

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:57.853
three,

01:12:59.120 --> 01:12:59.953
fuck you.

01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:06.023
- All right.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.220
Girls, I'm gonna have to
ask you to step outside

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.650
'cause this is about to get really ugly.

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:16.053
- No, we want to watch.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:17.773
We like to learn.

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:20.353
- All right.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.553
Thank you.

01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:32.570
Where is my friend Ruggero?

01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:39.150
- He's in my trunk, dead.

01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:39.983
- What?

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:41.450
- He killed one of 'em.

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:45.340
- You killed my friend because
he killed a fucking robot?

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.173
Goddamn it.

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:48.921
What, what are you doing?

01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:50.057
Ow!

01:14:02.557 --> 01:14:04.410
- You should be careful with that.

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:05.243
- Shut up.

01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.063
- All right.

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:10.520
But could you cut me out of this?

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.810
We're friends, right?

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:12.643
- Shut up.

01:14:12.643 --> 01:14:14.700
We have to think.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.860
- Do you know how to use this gun?

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.210
- Yeah, I watch television.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.020
- Shoot something.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.961
- I don't think that's
what she had in mind.

01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:34.070
- You seem far too relaxed.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.300
You shouldn't be.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.740
- Okay.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.830
I know what you're thinking.

01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:40.720
We human beings are pathetic.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.170
We have all this
technology to cure cancer,

01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:47.400
and colonize Mars, and make
the world a better place,

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.803
but instead, we make a boner
pill and robobots for sex.

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:54.460
It's shameful.

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.393
- This is not what I was going to say.

01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:59.740
- Why didn't you want to
make love to us, Cooper?

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.753
- Um.

01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:04.993
- You said we were out of your kink zone.

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.130
- You think we're substandard creatures?

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.255
Some inferior robotic race?

01:15:11.255 --> 01:15:12.210
- No.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.290
No, I do not think that.

01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:14.570
- Are you a racist?

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:15.403
- No.

01:15:15.403 --> 01:15:16.880
- You are a racist.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.760
You didn't even want to touch us.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.750
- That's because I have a girlfriend.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:22.110
I didn't want to cheat on her.

01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:24.210
- That's a lousy excuse.

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:25.043
- You're right.

01:15:25.043 --> 01:15:27.600
And now that you have this
gun pointing at my face,

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.180
I think we should reevaluate.

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:30.480
I think she'll understand.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.033
- What the fuck?

01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:42.530
Girls, why did you do this to me?

01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:44.220
Gaya, untie me.

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.410
We gotta get to the airport, now.

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:47.630
Nina, come on.

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:49.080
- Don't listen to him, girls.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.140
He's lying.

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.660
There's no way you could
walk through security

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.333
with all those electronics
and batteries inside of you.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.350
- Why are you lying to us, George?

01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:59.183
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:59.183 --> 01:16:00.040
No, no, no, no.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.450
We're not going through security.

01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:04.430
I got a private plane for you girls.

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:05.590
- Yeah, who owns the plane, George?

01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:07.460
Who are you selling them to?

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.470
- Don't listen to this guy.

01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.338
He wants to send you back to the factory.

01:16:25.474 --> 01:16:26.724
- That was fun.

01:16:27.797 --> 01:16:29.390
Do you have any more bullets?

01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:30.460
- Sorry, honey.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.810
That's all I carry for fun.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.793
- Hey, buddy.

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.438
- What the hell was that?

01:16:40.438 --> 01:16:41.271
- Vincent.

01:16:42.238 --> 01:16:43.571
- Denise.

01:16:48.493 --> 01:16:50.563
- I've been missing you so much, baby.

01:16:51.599 --> 01:16:52.849
- I missed you too, baby.

01:16:57.650 --> 01:16:59.693
What's going on here?

01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:46.823
This is a sad day for me, Cooper.

01:17:47.843 --> 01:17:49.023
A very sad day.

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.903
I fell in love with this thing.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.420
- Yeah, I wouldn't take it too hard.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.770
There's always version 2.0.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.910
- Are they gonna put them
on the market anytime soon?

01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:03.863
- I would think so.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.610
Why make robots if you're
not gonna sell 'em?

01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:09.220
- Okay.

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.053
Hey, Cooper.

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:15.610
Great job.

01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:16.573
You're a soldier.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.730
Why don't you stop by my office tomorrow?

01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:21.650
I've got quite a fat check for you.

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:22.780
- How fat?

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:24.510
- I think it'll make you smile.

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:26.123
- I don't smile easy.

01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:28.924
- I know.

01:18:28.924 --> 01:18:29.987
- All right.

01:18:29.987 --> 01:18:33.400
But tell your troops to get
this body out of my trunk.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.233
