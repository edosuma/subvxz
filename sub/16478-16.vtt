For how long?

04:55.069 --> 04:56.535

anybody heard from him

04:56.537 --> 04:57.670
was the night before last.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.138
Called a fellow JAG.

04:59.140 --> 05:02.274
Said he had something sensitive
to discuss with her,

05:02.276 --> 05:03.208

05:10.484 --> 05:11.717
if it wasn't important.

05:11.719 --> 05:13.285

05:18.426 --> 05:20.092
JAG Devereaux and I

05:20.094 --> 05:21.560
went to his apartment
last night,

05:21.562 --> 05:24.563
but there were no signs of him
or his car.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.432
Well, still, it's only been
a day and a half.

05:26.434 --> 05:28.500
I mean, NOPD doesn't even take
missing persons cases

05:28.502 --> 05:29.568

05:29.570 --> 05:31.537

we're talking about here.

05:35.643 --> 05:37.543

05:37.545 --> 05:41.113

much to go on here yet,

05:41.115 --> 05:42.848
but I've known
Rita a long time.

05:42.850 --> 05:44.984
She's not one to panic easily.

05:44.986 --> 05:46.018

05:46.020 --> 05:47.453
I told her we'd help.

05:53.928 --> 05:55.694
was there was nothing
on his computer.

05:55.696 --> 05:57.463

05:57.465 --> 06:00.132

to work on it.

06:00.134 --> 06:02.301
Maybe see if you can restore
what was on it.

06:02.303 --> 06:04.003

that might help us trace

06:13.047 --> 06:14.146

06:14.148 --> 06:15.514
You got it.

06:15.516 --> 06:16.582
What can I do?

06:16.584 --> 06:17.750
You and I

06:17.752 --> 06:18.954
are going
to Belle Chasse.

06:18.956 --> 06:19.484
Okay.

06:19.487 --> 06:23.355
See if we can figure out which,
if any, of Noah's cases

06:23.357 --> 06:25.591
have something to do
with his disappearance.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.826
Classified cases--
do we have access?

06:27.828 --> 06:29.561
Yeah, we do,
and Rita will meet us there

06:29.563 --> 06:31.163
to help us sort things out.

06:31.165 --> 06:32.464
Okay, then.

learned since I got here,

06:43.511 --> 06:45.444
is you have a definite
nose for justice.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.647

of taking the case, is all.

06:48.649 --> 06:50.149

06:50.151 --> 06:51.417

Yeah.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.292
Ladies? Yeah.

07:33.294 --> 07:35.994
We find anything in Noah's
case files that might help?

07:35.996 --> 07:39.398
No, nothing yet, unfortunately.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.467
I've gone through all
his current JAG caseload,

07:41.469 --> 07:43.802
but although sensitive,

07:43.804 --> 07:45.871
nothing stands out
as suspicious.

07:45.873 --> 07:47.806
What about his computer?
Has that been erased, too?

07:47.808 --> 07:49.441
No, it seems to be intact.

07:49.443 --> 07:51.643
His last entry
was calendaring the meet

07:51.645 --> 07:53.779
he wanted to have with me
tomorrow morning.

07:53.781 --> 07:55.914
Home computer wiped,
office not?

07:55.916 --> 07:57.516
If Noah's really missing,

07:57.518 --> 07:59.818
could be more of a personal
nature than business.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.186
Gregorio's right.

08:01.188 --> 08:02.387
If there aren't any leads here,

08:02.389 --> 08:04.323
but there were
at his apartment...

08:04.325 --> 08:06.191
Look, you knew him well.

08:06.193 --> 08:07.993
What did he do
with his personal time?

08:07.995 --> 08:09.695
We really haven't had a chance
to catch up

08:09.697 --> 08:11.563
since I moved back here
a couple months ago.

08:11.565 --> 08:13.132
Oh, you lived in New Orleans?

08:13.134 --> 08:14.633
Long time ago, way, way back

08:14.635 --> 08:16.468
when I first met Dwayne.

08:16.470 --> 08:19.538
Looks like Noah was pretty
involved with Fort MacArthur.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.939
GREGORIO:
What's Fort MacArthur?

08:20.941 --> 08:23.242
Private military academy
outside the city.

08:23.244 --> 08:26.111
Town has a long-standing history
with the school.

08:26.113 --> 08:28.580
Takes in troubled juvies
with criminal records.

08:28.582 --> 08:30.782
Place is their last shot
at turning their lives around.

08:30.784 --> 08:32.417
RITA: Just like it
did for Noah.

08:32.419 --> 08:33.919
Academy offered him
structure and direction.

08:33.921 --> 08:35.354
It's why he joined the Navy.

08:35.356 --> 08:37.456
And why he's been
volunteering there ever since.

08:37.457 --> 08:39.591
He likes to give back.

08:39.592 --> 08:41.293
A lot like you, actually.

08:43.998 --> 08:45.264
GREGORIO:
Looks like your friend

08:45.266 --> 08:47.533
was doing more
than volunteering.

08:47.535 --> 08:49.434
Student files, log books,

08:49.436 --> 08:50.903
leave requests,

08:50.905 --> 08:52.070
blueprints
of the school's ground.

08:52.072 --> 08:53.405
I mean, it almost feels like
(phone rings)

08:53.407 --> 08:55.641
he was investigating
something there.

08:55.643 --> 08:58.677
I wonder what.

08:58.679 --> 09:01.480
What you got, Sebastian?

09:01.482 --> 09:02.714
Okay.

09:02.716 --> 09:03.982
We're on our way.
Uh, tell Christopher

09:03.984 --> 09:05.984
we'll meet them there.

09:05.986 --> 09:08.887
Noah's computer
was erased remotely,

09:08.889 --> 09:12.824
but they were able to trace
the IP address to his laptop.

09:12.826 --> 09:14.760
Call me. Good or bad.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.161
Promise.

09:29.810 --> 09:31.476
Noah Sandler's vehicle.

09:31.478 --> 09:34.446
Judging by the tire tracks,
it sat here overnight.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.448
Any sign of Noah?
Not yet.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.650
Any idea what he was doing
all the way out here?

09:38.652 --> 09:40.052
Well, it could have been
gator hunt.

09:40.054 --> 09:41.420
Got the gear.

09:41.422 --> 09:43.689
It's a popular spot, but
you got to have courage.

09:43.691 --> 09:45.090
Meaning?

09:45.092 --> 09:47.426
(sighs) Lake Verret's
not the safest place to hunt.

09:47.428 --> 09:48.527
PRIDE: It's pretty
remote and dangerous.

09:48.529 --> 09:50.896
Nobody usually
comes out here alone.

09:50.898 --> 09:53.932
Found the laptop,
but it's been wiped clean, too.

09:53.934 --> 09:55.500
And according to Sebastian,

09:55.502 --> 09:58.437
it was used to remotely erase
Noah's home computer first.

09:58.439 --> 10:01.406
Noah didn't come all the way
out here to erase computers.

10:01.408 --> 10:04.042
King.

10:19.426 --> 10:21.560
Whoa.

10:21.562 --> 10:24.296
(growling)

10:26.634 --> 10:27.933
Hyah. Get back.
Hyah.

10:27.935 --> 10:29.901
(growling)
Hyah. Get back.

10:29.903 --> 10:31.737
Get back.

10:31.739 --> 10:33.672
Hyah. Yeah.

10:35.442 --> 10:36.742
(hisses)
Get back.

10:37.411 --> 10:38.477
Hyah.

10:41.482 --> 10:44.082
It's probably Noah.

10:46.453 --> 10:49.221
Looks like he's been shot twice.

10:49.223 --> 10:52.958
Which means our missing persons
case just turned into a murder.

11:06.454 --> 11:07.924
SEBASTIAN:
Hey, Doc Wade call you yet?

11:07.925 --> 11:08.729
No, why?

11:08.730 --> 11:10.897
She just finished her
prelim autopsy on JAG Noah.

11:10.899 --> 11:12.165
Turns out you were right.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.466
He was shot twice in the back.

11:13.468 --> 11:14.967
Hunting accident?

11:14.969 --> 11:16.536
I don't think so.
It was a tight pattern,

11:16.538 --> 11:17.737
and both went
right through the heart.

11:17.739 --> 11:19.572
Kill shots.

11:19.574 --> 11:21.841
Question is,
who killed him and why?

11:21.843 --> 11:24.110
Looked like he drove out there
by himself.

11:24.112 --> 11:25.578
Someone lying in wait,

11:25.580 --> 11:27.647
hoping to make it look
like a hunting accident?

11:27.649 --> 11:29.482
Yeah, how'd they know
he'd even be out there?

11:29.484 --> 11:30.650
And why was he there?

11:30.652 --> 11:32.218
Calls your friend Rita,

11:32.220 --> 11:34.587
says he wants to discuss
a sensitive case with her.

11:34.589 --> 11:36.289
Well, it had to be connected
to whatever case

11:36.291 --> 11:37.690
he wanted to talk to her about,
right?

11:37.692 --> 11:39.358
And told her it was important.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.295
Thing is, if Rita hadn't come
to me when she did,

11:42.297 --> 11:44.330
probably never would have found
Noah's body.

11:44.332 --> 11:46.098
Gators would have made sure
of that.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.034
Was probably what the killer
was hoping for.

11:48.036 --> 11:49.769
You and Patton have any luck
figuring out

11:49.771 --> 11:51.804
what was on Noah's computers
before they got erased?

11:51.806 --> 11:54.373
Nada. We even hacked into the
cloud to check the data stream.

11:54.375 --> 11:55.641
Which means whoever it was

11:55.643 --> 11:57.143
went through
an awful lot of trouble

11:57.145 --> 11:59.579
to cover up
whatever Noah was working on.

11:59.581 --> 12:00.813
RITA:
Any word?

12:07.488 --> 12:08.855
You said you would call.

12:08.857 --> 12:10.857
I know. But we just got back,

12:10.859 --> 12:14.827
and I...
I wanted to be sure first.

12:14.829 --> 12:16.762
Sure of what?

12:16.764 --> 12:18.731
Good or bad, you
wanted to know.

12:18.733 --> 12:20.533
It's not good.

12:20.535 --> 12:22.535
Noah was murdered, Rita.

12:22.537 --> 12:24.303
He was shot.

12:24.305 --> 12:27.206
What?

12:27.208 --> 12:28.574
How? Who?

12:28.576 --> 12:29.809
I don't know.

12:29.811 --> 12:32.879
We just started
the investigation.

12:32.881 --> 12:35.548
I assume that...

12:35.550 --> 12:38.684
that you've kept looking.

12:38.686 --> 12:41.387
Any idea what Noah wanted
to talk to you about yet?

12:41.389 --> 12:43.022
What was so important?

12:43.024 --> 12:46.759
I, uh...

12:46.761 --> 12:50.963
I think it had something to do
with Terrence Lewis.

12:50.965 --> 12:52.365
He's one of the cadets

12:52.367 --> 12:54.467
that Noah was mentoring
at the academy.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.869
I started looking more

12:56.871 --> 12:59.839
into Noah's Fort MacArthur
connections after you left.

12:59.841 --> 13:01.807
What's so special
about Lewis?

13:01.809 --> 13:03.676
Uh, Noah had requested

13:03.678 --> 13:06.078
the boy's
juvenile criminal file,

13:06.080 --> 13:07.980
but JAGs can't access
a minor's record

13:07.982 --> 13:09.315
without a court order.

13:09.317 --> 13:12.919
But A.D.A.s can, and
you're thinking that, uh,

13:12.921 --> 13:15.788
he called you, hoping you
could get him the files?

13:15.790 --> 13:17.456
Troubled kid, Terrence Lewis.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.525
Assault, armed robbery,

13:19.527 --> 13:22.061
and it doesn't look like he got
reformed at the academy, either.

13:22.063 --> 13:23.462
Kept getting into trouble,

13:23.464 --> 13:25.298
both in and out
of Fort MacArthur.

13:25.300 --> 13:29.068
If Terrence Lewis knew
Noah was investigating him...

13:29.070 --> 13:30.803
He might have killed
him so he couldn't?

13:30.805 --> 13:32.738
That's a stretch.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.340
I'm just looking
at the facts, Dwayne.

13:34.342 --> 13:35.808
It's what I do.

13:35.810 --> 13:39.478
And I'm sorry, but not every kid
can be reformed.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.580
And Lewis looks like he wasn't.

13:41.582 --> 13:44.917
Violent background,
access to weapons,

13:44.919 --> 13:48.321
and then Noah gets shot to death
before we can even meet?

13:48.323 --> 13:51.557
If that's not probable cause,
I don't know what is.

13:51.559 --> 13:54.694
Don't want to rush
to judgment here.

13:54.696 --> 13:57.630
Especially when it comes
to the kids at the academy.

13:57.632 --> 14:00.333
Suspects are suspects,
regardless of age.

14:00.335 --> 14:02.401
Look, I know that
Noah was your friend.

14:02.403 --> 14:03.703
That's got nothing to do
with this.

14:03.705 --> 14:05.805
It does when you're
not thinking straight

14:05.807 --> 14:08.074
'cause you're loaded for bear.

14:08.076 --> 14:11.510
(exhales)

14:13.748 --> 14:16.816
Might be the first argument
I ever won with you.

14:18.186 --> 14:21.420
I got a good team here, Rita.

14:21.422 --> 14:24.457
They're good at their jobs.

14:24.459 --> 14:27.860
Let us investigate
Terrence Lewis

14:27.862 --> 14:29.295
and whatever connection

14:29.297 --> 14:31.864
the academy may or may
not have had in this,

14:31.866 --> 14:36.402
and I promise we'll find
out who killed Noah.

14:38.206 --> 14:40.306
Okay.

14:40.308 --> 14:42.742
But if you don't, I will.

14:56.824 --> 14:58.891
(guns firing,
drill commands shouted)

15:08.169 --> 15:10.836
(drums playing)

15:15.676 --> 15:18.511
Agent Pride?
General Walsh.

15:18.513 --> 15:21.013
Heard a lot about you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

15:21.015 --> 15:22.181
PRIDE:
You, too, General.

15:22.183 --> 15:24.550
Special Agents Percy
and Lasalle.

15:24.552 --> 15:25.684
Welcome.
Hey, General.

15:25.686 --> 15:26.952
Welcome.
Thank you.

15:27.789 --> 15:28.888
DRILL SERGEANT:
Atten-hut.

15:28.890 --> 15:30.156
WALSH:
<i>So...</i>

15:30.158 --> 15:31.857
what brings NCIS
to Fort MacArthur?

15:31.859 --> 15:35.027
Well, probably best to
discuss in private.

15:35.029 --> 15:36.695
Minors around,

15:36.697 --> 15:38.831
want to handle this as
sensitively as possible.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.000
Understood...
and appreciated.

15:41.002 --> 15:44.036
Especially considering where
most of our cadets come from.

15:44.038 --> 15:47.073
Law tends to assume
the worst about them.

15:48.242 --> 15:51.043
Uh, General Sklahr, who is that?

15:51.045 --> 15:53.712
PRIDE: He was the man who
practically founded this place.

15:53.714 --> 15:55.047
You're familiar?

15:55.049 --> 15:56.882
Hard to grow up in
this town and not be.

15:56.884 --> 16:00.352
All the good he did,
troubled kids he helped.

16:00.354 --> 16:02.888
WALSH: He gave 'em a home,
a second chance.

16:02.890 --> 16:04.223
General Sklahr
was the father figure

16:04.225 --> 16:05.991
most of these boys
didn't have.

16:05.993 --> 16:07.993
That's large shoes to fill.

16:07.995 --> 16:10.629
Proud to have been appointed
to do exactly that.

16:10.631 --> 16:13.666
Although,
easier said than done.

16:14.635 --> 16:15.734
COMMANDING OFFICER:
Halt!

16:15.736 --> 16:17.570
CADETS:
♪ The military live... ♪

16:18.906 --> 16:23.542
So, which of my boys
is in trouble?

16:23.544 --> 16:25.244
Well, not sure
any are yet.

16:25.246 --> 16:26.645
That's why we're here.

16:26.647 --> 16:29.348
Hoping for an assist.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.917
We'd like to talk with one
of your cadets, Terrence Lewis.

16:31.919 --> 16:34.253
Well, so would I.

16:34.255 --> 16:36.789
Private Lewis has been UA
for three weeks now.

16:36.791 --> 16:39.525
Wish I could say
that was unusual.

16:39.527 --> 16:41.260
LASALLE: Lewis
go missing often?

16:41.262 --> 16:43.295
Unfortunately, yes.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.766
We take pride here
in reforming boys,

16:47.768 --> 16:49.468
teaching 'em
to obey orders,

16:49.470 --> 16:52.838
how to commit to something
larger than themselves.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.707
But, we're not
always successful

16:54.709 --> 16:56.242
and I'm afraid
that includes Private Lewis.

16:56.244 --> 16:58.344
You notify NOPD
he was missing?

16:58.346 --> 16:59.411
They don't
have the manpower

16:59.413 --> 17:01.714
to chase down runaways and...

17:01.716 --> 17:04.483
juvies like Lewis
aren't a high priority.

17:04.484 --> 17:06.018
What's he done?

17:06.020 --> 17:08.954
Again, not sure, but, uh...

17:11.992 --> 17:13.925
I'm sorry to say,

17:13.928 --> 17:16.862
JAG Noah Sandler
has been murdered.

17:18.299 --> 17:21.166
And Terrence Lewis
is a person of interest.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.804
(sighs)
Noah, my God.

17:25.806 --> 17:27.673
How, when?

17:27.675 --> 17:29.608
Last night.

17:29.610 --> 17:33.546
And what we know now is:
Noah was investigating Lewis.

17:33.548 --> 17:35.414
And maybe even the academy.

17:35.416 --> 17:36.949
Investigating?

17:36.951 --> 17:38.851
Noah never said anything to me
about it

17:38.853 --> 17:40.953
and he was here all the time.

17:40.955 --> 17:43.856
He mentored lots of boys,
not just Private Lewis.

17:43.858 --> 17:46.258
Is it all right if we speak
with Lewis' commanding officer?

17:46.260 --> 17:48.694
Of course. Uh...

17:48.696 --> 17:52.031
Dorsey,
come in here, please.

17:54.735 --> 17:56.368
Sir?

17:56.370 --> 17:58.971
These are NCIS agents,
Captain Dorsey.

17:58.973 --> 18:00.673
They need to speak
to Commander Cabral ASAP.

18:00.675 --> 18:02.942
Yes, sir. Right this way.

18:04.679 --> 18:06.812
Agent Pride?

18:06.814 --> 18:10.649
This news of Noah's death
is gonna hit the boys hard.

18:10.651 --> 18:13.352
I'd rather they hear it from me,
if that's all right with you.

18:13.354 --> 18:15.221
Yes, sir.

18:20.228 --> 18:21.393
(sighs)

18:23.698 --> 18:25.097
(door opens)

18:25.099 --> 18:26.899
What do we got,
Loretta?

18:28.069 --> 18:29.868
I'm sorry, that was way too much
like Pride.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.804
That was awful.
God, I got to work on that.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.472
I'll work on it,
it's gonna be fine.

18:33.474 --> 18:36.742
Stop trying so hard, Sebastian,
you're doing fine.

18:36.744 --> 18:38.677
I know, I know, I know,
it's just...

18:38.679 --> 18:42.381
still trying to find
my NCIS way, I guess. You know?

18:42.383 --> 18:44.116
Maybe I should
keep the moped.

18:44.118 --> 18:45.851
You here for an update?

18:45.853 --> 18:47.753
I am. Yeah,
inquiring minds want to know.

18:47.755 --> 18:49.255
Especially Pride's.

18:49.257 --> 18:51.924
Well, obviously, an intact body
would have helped,

18:51.926 --> 18:54.927
but from the pattern of the cuts
and abrasions I've seen,

18:54.929 --> 18:57.496
coupled with the lack
of coagulation,

18:57.498 --> 19:01.800
it appears JAG Noah's body
was dragged postmortem.

19:01.802 --> 19:03.602
Because of Tick-Tock Croc?

19:04.372 --> 19:06.939
It's a <i>Peter Pan</i> reference.

19:06.941 --> 19:08.474
Anyway,

19:08.476 --> 19:10.109
the alligator bite pattern
didn't match

19:10.111 --> 19:13.379
the indicated direction
of the cuts, so...

19:13.381 --> 19:15.881
So the killer must have
dragged Noah after he shot him,

19:15.883 --> 19:17.416
closer to the water.

19:17.418 --> 19:20.552
Hoping the alligators
would devour the evidence, yes.

19:20.554 --> 19:22.488
(sighs)
Doesn't really get us any closer

19:22.490 --> 19:24.990
to IDing the killer, though.

19:24.992 --> 19:26.625
Is there any way
that we can, uh,

19:26.627 --> 19:28.327
narrow down what type
of gun was used?

19:28.329 --> 19:30.663
It was definitely
an automatic rifle of some kind.

19:30.665 --> 19:32.498
Based on the...

19:32.500 --> 19:34.667
entry wound,
probably military.

19:34.669 --> 19:37.336
I can't be sure until
you find me the projectiles.

19:37.338 --> 19:39.138
Yeah, well, good luck
with that, right?

19:39.140 --> 19:41.940
A high-powered rifle, bullets
went right through the body,

19:41.942 --> 19:44.209
it's probably buried
back in the bayou somewhere.

19:44.211 --> 19:45.804
Mm-hmm. Sounds like
a field trip to me.

19:45.828 --> 19:47.346
Yeah.

19:47.848 --> 19:49.315
Wait, do you mean me?

19:51.752 --> 19:53.085
You-- you want me to go
back out there

19:53.087 --> 19:55.521
to deadly gator-world?
By myself?

19:55.523 --> 19:57.956
Tick-Tock Croc.

19:58.826 --> 20:00.492
(sighs)

20:01.595 --> 20:03.295
All right.

20:03.297 --> 20:04.963
I'll see you never.

20:04.965 --> 20:06.765
(door opens)

20:06.767 --> 20:08.067
DORSEY:
<i>Platoon, atten-hut!</i>

20:08.069 --> 20:09.568
Good afternoon, sir.

20:09.570 --> 20:10.936
At ease, Commander.

20:10.938 --> 20:13.138
Commander Cabral,
these are NCIS agents.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.973
They need to speak
with you in private.

20:14.975 --> 20:17.643
Of course, sir.

20:17.645 --> 20:19.311
Cole, front and center.

20:21.816 --> 20:23.749
Your command, Lieutenant.

20:23.751 --> 20:25.651
Aye, sir.

20:28.322 --> 20:30.089
Still can't wrap
my head around

20:30.091 --> 20:32.291
how teaching juvies
to shoot M16s

20:32.293 --> 20:34.059
helps reform them.

20:34.061 --> 20:36.495
Well, it's not about that.
It teaches them responsibility.

20:36.497 --> 20:38.564
At least this place
gives them a chance.

20:38.566 --> 20:40.165
Port arms!

20:41.902 --> 20:43.335
How can I be of assistance?

20:43.337 --> 20:44.937
I understand Terrence Lewis

20:44.939 --> 20:46.705
was in your squad,
Commander?

20:46.707 --> 20:49.241
<i>Is</i> in my squad.
Yes, sir.

20:49.243 --> 20:50.976
Although, currently,
Private Lewis is...

20:50.978 --> 20:53.145
UA, I know.
How well do you know him?

20:53.147 --> 20:56.515
General Walsh assigned him
to my squad three months ago.

20:56.517 --> 20:58.650
Hoped I could
straighten him out.

20:58.652 --> 21:01.687
How so?
Permission to speak freely?

21:01.689 --> 21:04.256
We're just looking
for answers.

21:04.258 --> 21:05.724
However you can help.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.862
Private Lewis was
a difficult recruit.

21:09.864 --> 21:11.997
The academy prides itself

21:11.999 --> 21:15.868
on strength through loyalty,
following orders.

21:15.870 --> 21:18.103
Lewis fought it
every step of the way.

21:18.105 --> 21:20.839
So I take it you and Lewis
didn't get along very well.

21:20.841 --> 21:23.542
Lewis didn't get along
with anyone very well.

21:23.544 --> 21:26.712
What about JAG Noah?
JAG...

21:26.714 --> 21:29.615
He's the best, he's always
been there for us.

21:29.617 --> 21:32.284
Lewis, too, but...

21:32.286 --> 21:33.786
But what, son?

21:36.357 --> 21:38.757
Just a few weeks ago,
JAG Noah tried to help Lewis

21:38.759 --> 21:40.726
with some stuff
he was going through.

21:40.728 --> 21:43.195
But Lewis got mad.

21:43.197 --> 21:44.797
Violent, even.

21:44.799 --> 21:47.232
Hit JAG Noah-- hard, too.

21:48.502 --> 21:50.736
That's the last anyone
ever saw of him.

21:55.075 --> 21:56.175
(device beeping slowly)

21:56.177 --> 21:58.010
(loud growl)
What the...?

22:04.552 --> 22:07.252
(beeping)

22:17.498 --> 22:19.031
(beeping rapidly)

22:20.234 --> 22:22.134
Bingo.

22:37.117 --> 22:38.484
Okay.

22:41.255 --> 22:42.654
(beeping steadily)

22:46.694 --> 22:48.660
(beeping rapidly)

22:54.668 --> 22:56.034
Oh, my God!

23:08.660 --> 23:10.726
Judging by the rate
of decomposition,

23:10.728 --> 23:13.362
I'd estimate the boy died
about three weeks ago.

23:13.364 --> 23:15.364
SEBASTIAN:
Same time Lewis went UA.

23:15.366 --> 23:16.365
Cause of death?

23:16.367 --> 23:17.366
WADE: Your missing cadet

23:17.368 --> 23:18.834
was obviously beaten.

23:18.836 --> 23:20.736
Even after all this time,
bruises on his face,

23:20.738 --> 23:22.505
arms, and chest
are still evident.

23:22.507 --> 23:24.840
Yeah, more interesting, though,
is what was used to beat him.

23:24.842 --> 23:26.542
Yes, we recovered
the same substance

23:26.544 --> 23:29.145
found in the epidermis
of the bruises--

23:29.147 --> 23:31.948
lye, glycerin,
potassium hydroxide...

23:31.950 --> 23:35.017
I.e., soap. We even found trace
amounts of it in Lewis' mouth.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.186
Soap?
Soap bashing.

23:37.188 --> 23:41.023
A hazing technique
the military has long condemned.

23:41.025 --> 23:44.026
Except soap didn't break
the boy's parietal bone.

23:44.028 --> 23:45.661
The cause of death was
a sharp blow

23:45.663 --> 23:47.430
to the back of the head,
and I'm still trying

23:47.432 --> 23:49.398
to figure out
exactly what was used.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.100
Hazing gone too far?

23:51.102 --> 23:53.803
If so, JAG Noah may have been
investigating

23:53.805 --> 23:56.505
Terrence Lewis as a victim,
not a juvie.

23:56.507 --> 23:58.474
Somehow figured out
where the body had been dumped,

23:58.476 --> 24:00.476
went to Lake Verret
to investigate,

24:00.478 --> 24:02.445
and then got shot
by whoever killed Lewis.

24:02.447 --> 24:05.948
Well, I hate to say it,
but if more than one cadet

24:05.950 --> 24:08.618
really did haze Lewis,
then it's hard to believe

24:08.620 --> 24:10.653
they're not responsible
for both murders.

24:10.655 --> 24:12.688
We're not gonna jump
to conclusions here, okay?

24:12.690 --> 24:14.123
(phone beeping)
We need to be sure.

24:14.125 --> 24:18.260
Okay, Loretta,
I need to know what <i>exactly</i>

24:18.262 --> 24:20.062
was used to kill Terrence Lewis.

24:20.064 --> 24:21.130
On it.

24:21.132 --> 24:22.198
PRIDE:
Sebastian,

24:22.200 --> 24:23.299
get an ID on those bullets

24:23.301 --> 24:24.333
that killed JAG Noah.

24:24.335 --> 24:25.601
I want to know
what type of weapon

24:25.603 --> 24:26.769
they came from ASAP.

24:26.771 --> 24:28.571
Copy that.
Where you going?

24:28.573 --> 24:29.739
Rita just texted.

24:29.741 --> 24:31.140
I need to try
and slow her down.

24:31.142 --> 24:33.509
Send her up as soon
as she gets here.

24:36.881 --> 24:39.515
Max Cabral,
assault with a deadly weapon.

24:39.517 --> 24:41.550
William Cole,
aggravated assault.

24:41.552 --> 24:43.753
Jamal Povey, attempted rape.
Rita...

24:43.755 --> 24:46.689
Tyler Wilson, armed robbery.
And the list goes on.

24:46.691 --> 24:48.991
I unsealed every cadet's
criminal record

24:48.993 --> 24:50.526
after I heard about
what happened.

24:50.528 --> 24:52.361
I know Noah believed
in these boys, Dwayne.

24:52.363 --> 24:53.796
I know you probably do, too.

24:53.798 --> 24:55.297
But you can't tell me

24:55.299 --> 24:57.967
none of them are
capable of murder.

24:57.969 --> 24:59.735
You can't prejudge them
from their past.

24:59.737 --> 25:02.138
That's not fair.
That's what reform's all about.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.906
This isn't about
reform anymore.

25:03.908 --> 25:05.241
This is about justice.

25:05.243 --> 25:06.976
I agree, but all
I'm saying is

25:06.978 --> 25:08.611
we don't know enough yet.

25:08.613 --> 25:10.646
Well, we know enough to get
a search and arrest warrant

25:10.648 --> 25:12.081
for the entire academy,

25:12.083 --> 25:14.116
which is exactly what
I'm going to do.

25:14.118 --> 25:15.451
And what if you're wrong,

25:15.453 --> 25:16.786
like you were yesterday,

25:16.788 --> 25:19.255
when you thought that
Lewis killed Noah?

25:19.257 --> 25:21.490
Bring all those warrants,
media follows,

25:21.492 --> 25:23.626
makes this headline news,

25:23.628 --> 25:25.094
and Fort MacArthur
gets shut down.

25:25.096 --> 25:27.229
Is that what you want?
No! I want justice,

25:27.231 --> 25:29.398
and you should
want that, too.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.734
They're boys.
They're suspects!

25:35.073 --> 25:38.908
Look, I know everybody
in this town loves you, Dwayne.

25:38.910 --> 25:41.944
They always have because
you always put them first.

25:41.946 --> 25:43.012
Believe me, I know.

25:43.014 --> 25:44.113
This isn't about us, Rita.

25:44.115 --> 25:46.148
I know how you grew up.

25:46.150 --> 25:47.817
I know how you want
to give everyone,

25:47.819 --> 25:50.486
especially the underdogs,
the benefit of the doubt,

25:50.488 --> 25:53.723
but sometimes they
don't deserve it.

25:53.725 --> 25:56.225
We don't know enough yet.

25:56.227 --> 25:59.295
There's too much risk to those
boys and to the academy.

25:59.297 --> 26:01.297
So, Rita, please...

26:01.299 --> 26:03.032
I disagree.

26:03.034 --> 26:05.000
JAG Noah may be
your jurisdiction,

26:05.002 --> 26:06.702
but Terrence Lewis is mine.

26:06.704 --> 26:09.205
I'm getting the arrest warrants.

26:15.980 --> 26:17.613
DRILL SERGEANT:
Hut!

26:17.615 --> 26:20.216
(sighs)
I don't believe this.

26:20.218 --> 26:21.917
Hazing? Murder?

26:21.919 --> 26:23.552
WALSH: If any of this is true,
I've lost total control

26:23.554 --> 26:25.187
of this school.

26:25.189 --> 26:26.989
How certain are you of this?

26:26.991 --> 26:28.491
The bullets that killed Noah
could have come

26:28.493 --> 26:30.192
from one of
the academy's rifles,

26:30.194 --> 26:31.794
so we need to find out
what is true

26:31.796 --> 26:34.530
if we have any hopes
of containing the situation.

26:34.532 --> 26:35.831
And to do that, we need to

26:35.833 --> 26:38.067
test your cadets'
rifles for matches,

26:38.069 --> 26:40.002
and know which students
were off-campus or on leave

26:40.004 --> 26:41.437
during both murders.

26:43.541 --> 26:45.040
I'll get the logs.

26:46.944 --> 26:49.445
(gunshots)
Clear!

26:53.351 --> 26:55.918
Thank you guys
for your cooperation.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.386
Didn't know how
you would act

26:57.388 --> 26:59.822
after finding out
what happened to JAG Noah.

26:59.824 --> 27:00.923
He'd be the first
to counsel calm

27:00.925 --> 27:02.224
and tell us to follow orders,

27:02.226 --> 27:03.359
and that's what I'm doing.

27:03.361 --> 27:04.727
Okay, whose rifle's
up next?

27:04.729 --> 27:06.595
Commander Cabral's.
Let's have it.

27:16.007 --> 27:19.375
(gunshots) I still don't understand, why
are they checking our guns?

27:19.377 --> 27:20.676
I don't know.

27:20.678 --> 27:24.013
Commander Cabral.
At ease.

27:24.015 --> 27:25.481
General Walsh needs
to see you, Commander.

27:25.483 --> 27:27.149
It's about Private Lewis.

27:30.788 --> 27:33.122
<i>Fide, Honorem, Victoria.</i>

27:36.294 --> 27:38.294
Yes, sir.

27:41.732 --> 27:44.033
Prep the squad for Code 18.

27:44.035 --> 27:45.768
But...
Just do it!

27:45.770 --> 27:48.237
(gunshots)

27:48.239 --> 27:51.173
Christopher?
What is it?

27:51.175 --> 27:54.210
I don't know, but I don't have
a good feeling about this.

27:54.212 --> 27:56.645
Something's definitely up
over there.

28:08.426 --> 28:11.760
One ID shows off premises
at the time of both murders.

28:11.762 --> 28:14.096
Dog tag 2476.

28:14.098 --> 28:15.364
PRIDE: 247...

28:15.366 --> 28:17.733
Lieutenant Commander
Max Cabral.

28:17.735 --> 28:18.506
Max?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.203
Yeah, well, his rifle just
matched the bullets

28:20.204 --> 28:21.437
that killed JAG Noah.

28:21.439 --> 28:22.671
(alarm blaring)
What's that?

28:22.673 --> 28:24.440
It's a lockdown.

28:24.442 --> 28:26.075
But I didn't order it.

28:28.312 --> 28:31.447
Whoa!
What the hell is going on?

28:31.449 --> 28:34.516
I'm protecting the academy.
Hands up!

28:45.439 --> 28:47.906
(sirens wailing)

28:54.749 --> 28:57.116
(alarm blaring)

28:58.319 --> 29:00.519
Let's go, come on.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.421
Down here.
Come on, let's go.

29:02.423 --> 29:04.656
Stop looking back.

29:05.559 --> 29:07.192
Keep going, come on!

29:10.765 --> 29:12.064
You don't know what
you're doing, son.

29:12.066 --> 29:13.298
You're not thinking straight.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.733
What is this supposed to...
Sit down!

29:14.735 --> 29:16.502
Sit down!

29:18.105 --> 29:19.972
CABRAL:
Pull their weapons.

29:19.974 --> 29:22.274
(alarm buzzer continues)

29:25.012 --> 29:26.478
(cell phone ringing)

29:29.383 --> 29:31.116
You should answer that.
Talk to him.

29:31.118 --> 29:32.351
No, don't.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.586
Don't.

29:34.588 --> 29:35.988
We're under strict orders.

29:35.990 --> 29:38.524
Orders?
Orders from who?

29:41.228 --> 29:43.028
Stand watch.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.080
Go! Go! Go!
(indistinct shouting)

29:50.571 --> 29:52.538
No answer?
No. It's weird.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.872
Pride.
Anything?

29:53.874 --> 29:55.941
NOPD and LSP are
evacuating the students.

29:55.943 --> 29:57.209
SWAT's taking position.

29:57.211 --> 29:59.211
Geez-- Dorsey!

29:59.213 --> 30:00.345
Why is SWAT here?

30:00.347 --> 30:02.181
Rita.

30:02.183 --> 30:03.849
She called them. It's procedure
when serving felony warrants,

30:03.851 --> 30:05.951
and in this case,
it's obviously warranted.

30:05.953 --> 30:07.753
Where the hell
are Christopher and Sonja?

30:07.755 --> 30:08.987
NOPD saw a squad of them
take them

30:08.989 --> 30:10.623
into the mess hall at gunpoint.

30:10.624 --> 30:11.149
What?

30:11.153 --> 30:12.559
Students were
blocking the windows.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.426
No one's answering.
Things are getting

30:14.428 --> 30:16.395
out of hand here, General. Fast.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.830
Dorsey!

30:17.832 --> 30:19.798
Sir.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.601
You just spoke to Commander
Cabral, what did he say?

30:22.603 --> 30:23.936
Well, he didn't say anything.
I just told him

30:23.938 --> 30:25.204
you wanted to talk to him
about Lewis,

30:25.206 --> 30:26.872
then he triggered a lockdown.

30:26.874 --> 30:27.906
You don't think Cabral

30:27.908 --> 30:29.241
had anything to do
with this, do you?

30:29.243 --> 30:31.176
No, no, no. Hold on.
All we know right now

30:31.178 --> 30:34.479
is that the bullets
match Cabral's rifle.

30:34.481 --> 30:35.581
That's it.
SEBASTIAN: Right.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.015
Why would he hand us
over his rifle

30:37.017 --> 30:39.451
when we asked for it,
without even hesitating,

30:39.453 --> 30:40.445
if he knew it was gonna
match the murder weapon?

30:40.469 --> 30:41.221
GREGORIO: He wouldn't have

30:41.222 --> 30:43.422
let you test it.
Get ahold of Loretta.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.257
Okay, let's hope
she's got some answers.

30:45.259 --> 30:46.792
We're missing something here.

30:46.794 --> 30:48.360
I'm still trying
to establish communication

30:48.362 --> 30:50.529
and waiting on drones, stand by.

30:50.531 --> 30:52.865
A.D.A. Devereaux.
What's going on? What happened?

30:52.867 --> 30:54.333
The cadets have locked down
the school.

30:54.335 --> 30:55.868
Wait, because of the warrants?

30:55.870 --> 30:57.336
We never got a chance
to serve them.

30:57.338 --> 30:58.871
Now, they're ensconced,
heavily armed

30:58.873 --> 30:59.905
and they've got hostages.

30:59.907 --> 31:01.840
How long till HRT gets here?

31:01.842 --> 31:03.575
(sighs)
15 to 20 minutes,

31:03.577 --> 31:06.945
but based on the situation,
we may not have that long.

31:06.947 --> 31:08.881
I want scopes in every window
and access...

31:08.883 --> 31:10.482
Okay, look, I don't want
this blowing up on us.

31:10.484 --> 31:13.018
We need to find out
what they want first.

31:13.020 --> 31:14.953
It's not up to me, it's up
to them, but the fact is,

31:14.955 --> 31:16.688
is they've taken hostages.

31:16.690 --> 31:17.956
Hey, they'll listen to me.

31:17.958 --> 31:19.858
Let me go in,
talk to Commander Cabral.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.994
I'm his commanding officer,
he'll do whatever I say.

31:21.996 --> 31:24.129
It may be the only
way to save them.

31:35.342 --> 31:37.175
WADE: The lethal blow
to the head on Terrence Lewis

31:37.177 --> 31:39.011
was administered
after the hazing.

31:39.013 --> 31:40.045
How long after?

31:40.047 --> 31:41.780
12, 15 hours.

31:41.782 --> 31:43.048
So, it's not due to the hazing?

31:43.050 --> 31:44.950
Unless Lewis threatened
to tell somebody

31:44.952 --> 31:46.485
after the fact,
and got killed later.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.886
Yeah, there's still
not enough there

31:47.888 --> 31:49.855
to let Commander Cabral
off the hook.

31:49.857 --> 31:51.723
Any idea
what the murder weapon was?

31:51.725 --> 31:54.793
No, but I did find
some curious details.

31:54.795 --> 31:56.228
I found a sliver of wood

31:56.230 --> 31:58.764
in the boy's skull,
not just any wood,

31:58.766 --> 32:00.432
but 200-year-old cedar.

32:00.434 --> 32:04.036
Also, trace amounts of sulfur,
charcoal, saltpeter.

32:04.038 --> 32:05.904
That sounds
like black gunpowder.

32:05.906 --> 32:08.507
Black gunpowder, you mean,
like from the Civil War?

32:08.509 --> 32:10.542
WALSH:
Yeah.

32:11.612 --> 32:12.744
Pride, what is it?

32:12.746 --> 32:14.479
Sebastian,

32:14.481 --> 32:18.116
if somebody swung one
of these old rifles hard enough,

32:18.118 --> 32:20.285
could trace amounts
of black gunpowder...

32:20.287 --> 32:21.520
Get dislodged,
and end up embedded

32:21.522 --> 32:23.188
in the skull? Absolutely.

32:24.458 --> 32:27.259
Any idea where the missing
rifle is, General?

32:27.261 --> 32:29.194
I never even noticed
it was gone.

32:29.196 --> 32:31.496
Who else has access
to the office?

32:31.498 --> 32:32.798
Captain Dorsey.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.032
Where is Dorsey?

32:37.938 --> 32:40.072
CABRAL:
This is not a negotiation.

32:40.074 --> 32:42.407
We don't have a choice,
Lieutenant.

32:42.409 --> 32:44.309
All I'm saying is maybe
we should listen to them.

32:44.311 --> 32:45.544
We didn't do anything wrong.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.312
Lewis is dead because of us!

32:47.314 --> 32:49.314
We were ordered to haze him,

32:49.316 --> 32:51.917
just like we were ordered
to do this.

32:51.919 --> 32:54.086
We didn't kill Lewis any more
than we killed JAG Noah.

32:54.088 --> 32:56.455
You think anyone outside
of here cares about that?

32:56.457 --> 32:58.190
Everything this place
stands for is on the line.

32:58.192 --> 32:59.524
Do you understand?

32:59.526 --> 33:01.960
We follow orders. Period.

33:01.962 --> 33:04.496
But following orders
is what got us into this mess

33:04.498 --> 33:06.164
in the first place.

33:09.470 --> 33:11.737
PRIDE:
Rita!

33:13.273 --> 33:15.474
I'm sorry to say this, Dwayne,
but I think this proves

33:15.476 --> 33:17.009
I was right
about the cadets.

33:17.011 --> 33:18.844
Actually, I think
they're being set up.

33:18.846 --> 33:21.113
I don't think any of
the cadets killed Lewis or Noah.

33:21.115 --> 33:24.182
Based on what?
Have you seen Captain Dorsey?

33:24.184 --> 33:26.051
Dorsey, we just sent him
inside. Why?

33:28.355 --> 33:30.222
(door closes)

33:36.397 --> 33:38.597
Stand down.

33:43.437 --> 33:46.371
You were supposed to contain
the situation, Cadet.

33:47.408 --> 33:49.107
Now I have to clean it up.

33:50.477 --> 33:51.810
With me.

34:06.328 --> 34:08.360
(urgent chatter, guns clicking)

34:08.362 --> 34:11.998
All I'm saying is, the situation
may not be as it appears.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.166
We think Commander Cabral's

34:13.168 --> 34:15.735
being set up by the man
you just let inside.

34:15.737 --> 34:17.536
Cabral is holding two
of your own people hostage.

34:17.539 --> 34:19.438
He's just following orders.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.541
And so am I. My job is clear,
Agent Pride,

34:21.543 --> 34:23.810
and that's to defuse
the situation any way I can.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.812
MAN (over radio): Dugan?
Excuse me.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.313
RITA: This doesn't
make any sense.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.681
If you're right,
and the boys are innocent,

34:28.683 --> 34:31.284
why do this?
Why take hostages?

34:31.286 --> 34:33.518
The whole premise of reform here
is to teach cadets

34:33.521 --> 34:34.887
to obey orders without question,

34:34.889 --> 34:37.023
to put the academy first.

34:37.025 --> 34:39.458
Obviously, Dorsey
took advantage of that.

34:39.460 --> 34:42.395
Wait, you're saying Dorsey
killed Noah and, and Lewis? Why?

34:42.397 --> 34:44.630
SEBASTIAN: Pride.
Talk to me.

34:44.632 --> 34:47.065
The general got me access to
Dorsey's personnel files.

34:47.068 --> 34:49.101
Apparently, he applied
to take over the academy

34:49.103 --> 34:51.904
after the last general died,
but Walsh got it instead.

34:51.906 --> 34:53.806
That's not motivation for murder.
Well, no.

34:53.808 --> 34:55.942
But the main reason that
he got passed over might be.

34:55.944 --> 34:57.377
See, Dorsey had been
reprimanded several times

34:57.379 --> 34:58.678
for abuse of authority,

34:58.680 --> 35:00.880
including ordering
the hazing of cadets.

35:00.882 --> 35:03.516
So things with Lewis
went too far,

35:03.518 --> 35:06.252
they got out of hand,
JAG Noah figured it out...

35:06.254 --> 35:07.420
And he had to kill him, too.

35:07.422 --> 35:08.788
Still doesn't explain why Cabral

35:08.790 --> 35:10.290
locked down the school.

35:10.292 --> 35:11.991
No, it does.

35:11.993 --> 35:14.694
It does, if he's following
Dorsey's orders.

35:14.696 --> 35:18.331
And if Dorsey's trying
to make Max look guilty...

35:19.801 --> 35:21.634
Where's Gregorio?

35:22.871 --> 35:24.570
PRIDE:
We only got one shot at this.

35:24.572 --> 35:28.174
Got it, Pride.
I just hope we have enough time.

35:29.944 --> 35:31.678
Hey. If you're innocent,

35:31.680 --> 35:34.480
if Max is innocent,
we can prove it,

35:34.482 --> 35:36.382
But not like this.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.785
Besides, even the military's
not supposed to follow orders

35:38.787 --> 35:40.253
if they're illegal,

35:40.255 --> 35:42.722
or criminal...
hey, and neither are you.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.457
Look, if you want
to do what's right?

35:44.459 --> 35:45.892
What is wrong with you?

35:45.894 --> 35:48.328
We can stop this
before it's too late.

35:48.330 --> 35:50.330
You can stop this.

35:50.332 --> 35:52.732
But please,

35:52.734 --> 35:54.934
let us go.

35:59.808 --> 36:02.175
You are an embarrassment
to the uniform.

36:02.177 --> 36:03.943
This is your mess, Commander.

36:03.945 --> 36:05.244
I was following your orders.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.280
My orders were to protect
the academy,

36:07.282 --> 36:08.815
not to put it at risk,

36:08.817 --> 36:10.583
which is exactly
what you've done.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.972
What the hell were you thinking?

36:11.996 --> 36:13.220
You're the one
that started this.

36:13.221 --> 36:15.588
You're the one that told me to
haze Lewis, scare him straight.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.423
But you went too far,
didn't you?

36:17.425 --> 36:18.991
Lewis threatened
to expose it,

36:18.993 --> 36:20.927
but that would've brought down
the very institution

36:20.929 --> 36:22.095
that's kept you
from spending the rest

36:22.097 --> 36:23.763
of your sorry-ass life
in prison.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.098
I didn't kill Lewis!

36:25.100 --> 36:26.499
But I had to!

36:26.501 --> 36:28.000
To protect
the academy

36:28.002 --> 36:29.669
from the same mess.

36:29.671 --> 36:31.671
What about JAG Noah?

36:31.673 --> 36:33.773
Also on you.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.275
After he figured out
what happened,

36:36.277 --> 36:37.977
tracked down Lewis's body,

36:37.979 --> 36:41.481
I had to do something to protect
us all from your screwups!

36:41.483 --> 36:43.349
Loyalty above all else!

36:45.120 --> 36:47.019
Remember that?

36:47.021 --> 36:49.021
That's what
this place stands for.

36:49.023 --> 36:51.624
But that's something
you obviously don't get.

36:51.626 --> 36:52.992
You're a failure,
Cabral,

36:52.994 --> 36:55.294
a failure to yourself,
and this institution.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.897
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

36:58.833 --> 37:01.300
Do I have permission to fire?

37:01.302 --> 37:02.869
You think you got the balls?

37:02.871 --> 37:05.705
Go ahead, pull the trigger!
Shoot me!

37:05.707 --> 37:08.007
No, but I do. Move.

37:11.379 --> 37:13.446
Do it!

37:21.723 --> 37:23.322
Federal agents! Don't move!

37:23.324 --> 37:25.358
Put your hands up!

37:36.004 --> 37:37.470
All clear, all clear.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.105
Nice shot, Gregorio.

37:39.107 --> 37:40.506
I knew you could do it.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.741
See you when you get
back down here.

37:41.743 --> 37:42.708
Copy that.

37:42.710 --> 37:44.076
Just out of curiosity,

37:44.078 --> 37:45.244
how'd you know
that would work?

37:45.246 --> 37:46.712
That that was Dorsey's plan?

37:46.714 --> 37:48.781
I didn't,
but I couldn't figure out

37:48.783 --> 37:50.383
what else he was gonna do.

37:50.385 --> 37:53.486
Backed in the corner,
knew we were onto him,

37:53.488 --> 37:55.121
assumed things would escalate.

37:55.123 --> 37:57.723
So, in other words,
it was just a hunch?

37:57.725 --> 38:00.426
I prefer “educated guess.”

38:02.063 --> 38:04.063
(exhales)

38:04.065 --> 38:06.065
(chuckles)

38:10.572 --> 38:12.738
(piano playing)

38:14.275 --> 38:18.144
GREGORIO: Still can't quite
figure him out.

38:18.146 --> 38:20.646
Figure out who? Pride?

38:20.648 --> 38:22.281
Yeah.
What's there to figure out?

38:22.283 --> 38:23.483
He's the man.

38:23.485 --> 38:25.284
I think she's talking
about his personal life.

38:25.286 --> 38:26.652
Oh.

38:26.654 --> 38:28.221
Yeah, but playing piano
is his personal life.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.922
Nah, there's got to be
more to it than that.

38:29.924 --> 38:31.524
He's such a good catch.

38:33.127 --> 38:35.628
I mean, he should be hooked
up with someone, no?

38:37.765 --> 38:41.801
Talking professional curiosity
here, let's just be clear.

38:41.803 --> 38:43.970
Look, King is not in a hurry
to get together

38:43.972 --> 38:45.404
with anyone anytime soon.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.840
SONJA: Yeah.
He's just happy being King.

38:47.842 --> 38:49.775
SONJA: It's true.
Okay. Well, like I said,

38:49.777 --> 38:52.478
he's a great catch, and
it's just not natural.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.881
You're just cranky that you lost
the bet about Rita.

38:54.883 --> 38:57.483
- Bingo. - Exactly! I forgot.
- I'm cranky? I'm cranky?

38:57.485 --> 39:00.253
Yeah, you cranky.
Then why is she here?

39:00.255 --> 39:01.787
GREGORIO:
Huh?

39:08.463 --> 39:10.763
I see I made
an impression on you.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.865
Oh, yeah? How's that?

39:12.867 --> 39:15.301
Lighter touch on the keys,
less tense.

39:15.303 --> 39:17.069
All right,
you're pretty confident.

39:17.071 --> 39:18.604
(chuckles)
Uh, not so much.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.274
Certainly not after
I nearly caused a disaster.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.708
You're being too hard
on yourself.

39:22.710 --> 39:24.677
Eh. What else is new?

39:24.679 --> 39:26.512
I should've known better.

39:26.514 --> 39:27.914
I should've remembered.

39:27.916 --> 39:30.116
Never go up against
one of your hunches.

39:30.118 --> 39:33.486
Oh, I don't know, my way
could've gone sideways, too.

39:33.488 --> 39:35.555
Troubled history
those kids had even before

39:35.557 --> 39:37.290
they get to the academy,
hard not to think

39:37.292 --> 39:39.825
that where there's smoke,
there's fire.

39:39.827 --> 39:41.894
Well, certainly
what Captain Dorsey was hoping

39:41.896 --> 39:43.729
to make everybody believe.

39:43.731 --> 39:45.831
D.A. thinks he wasn't
just trying to frame Max,

39:45.833 --> 39:48.634
but also make Walsh look
bad so he could take over.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.404
Almost brought down
the academy instead.

39:51.406 --> 39:53.806
Thanks for putting in
a good word on their behalf.
