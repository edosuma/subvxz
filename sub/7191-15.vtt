18:39.076 --> 18:41.161
Now, I understand that

18:41.245 --> 18:43.205
the two of you
had a little...

18:43.288 --> 18:44.623
disagreement last year.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.958
- Little?

18:46.041 --> 18:47.751
He tried to bite
my ear off.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.879
- Oh...
[giggling]

18:50.963 --> 18:51.880
No!
No, no.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.967
That was just a little...

18:55.050 --> 18:58.470
traditional
Transyl-Venetian, uh,

18:58.554 --> 18:59.930
greeting thing.

19:00.013 --> 19:03.225
But we have been teaching
Phillip American customs.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.103
Phillip?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.188
- Nice to meet you.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.231
- Hmm?

19:11.316 --> 19:12.359
- [growling]
- Ahh!

19:12.442 --> 19:14.069
- No!
Phillip, stop, stop!

19:14.153 --> 19:15.320
Sit, heel!

19:16.530 --> 19:18.657
- Joke, funny...
[chuckling]

19:18.740 --> 19:21.243
URSULA: [chuckling]

19:21.326 --> 19:23.412
Okay, good, Phillip.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.539
All right,
is everything in order?

19:25.622 --> 19:27.499
- Yes, everything's in order.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.752
Ursula, I didn't know you wanted
to have more children.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.421
- Say what?

19:32.504 --> 19:33.505
- It says here
that you are adopting him.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.382
- I what?

19:37.175 --> 19:38.176
- Mom.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.264
- The whole night
was just insane.

19:42.347 --> 19:46.226
- I know, but you didn't have to
threaten everyone like that.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.479
- They were all ganging up on me
and wanted to take me out.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.106
They even brought a zombie
with them.

19:51.189 --> 19:54.651
Witches I can deal with,
but a zombie?

19:54.735 --> 19:57.362
- I know, but I think he's
actually pretty harmless now.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.947
He even hugged Maddie
this morning

19:59.031 --> 20:00.991
to say sorry for almost
eating her last year.

20:01.074 --> 20:04.119
- Well, yeah, because
he's biased towards witches.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.079
Just like everyone else.

20:07.956 --> 20:08.916
[sobbing]

20:08.999 --> 20:10.709
- Oh, no, no-no-no-no.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.002
Don't--don't cry.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.837
Uh, I don't have a tissue,

20:13.921 --> 20:14.212
but I'm gonna go get one.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.469
- What's up, buddy?
- Hey, man.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.431
- Hey, Mia, are you okay?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.060
- Well, well, well.

20:28.143 --> 20:31.480
Look who it is.
"Betray-go."

20:31.563 --> 20:33.774
- Hey, I didn't
try to betray anybody.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.817
I was just trying
to keep the peace.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.902
- Which is a nicer way
of saying

20:36.985 --> 20:38.862
you're a traitor
against all Kanay kind.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.119
- Oh, Mrs. Jones, good.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.666
Why is there a kangaroo
in the hallway?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.211
Hey, buddy, how are you?

20:55.420 --> 20:56.588
Are you...

21:00.300 --> 21:02.094
Ah, ah, ah!

21:03.303 --> 21:04.972
- Oh, this better work.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.556
Good thinking
on the paperwork spell.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.016
- I hope I gave her
everything she needs.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.518
We didn't have time
to go through it.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.852
- Yeah, Daniel should've
just kept him at home.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.188
- And let him eat his mom?

21:13.271 --> 21:14.356
- Look, he wouldn't do that.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.315
DANIEL: Help!

21:15.399 --> 21:17.734
- What? Daniel?
- Run!

21:17.818 --> 21:19.403
There's a kangaroo!

21:19.486 --> 21:20.278
- I'm adopting him?

21:20.362 --> 21:22.322
- In there!
- What! No!

21:22.406 --> 21:25.033
- What are you do--
let go of us!
