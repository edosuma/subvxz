WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.619
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:03.620 --> 00:04.789
There's this tactical paramedic
training program.

00:04.790 --> 00:05.879
They recruited me.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.829
Does that mean
you're leaving Seattle?

00:07.830 --> 00:11.039
I was really ready to spend
the rest of my life with you.

00:11.040 --> 00:14.959
I get to spend the rest of mine
with you.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.669
Chief Ripley was a boss
to most of us.

00:17.670 --> 00:21.079
As Lucas, he gave even more
to those he loved.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.959
You are not coping.
It's a healthy first step.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.459
Shut up! Just shut... shut up!

00:25.460 --> 00:26.749
Hughes, right?

00:26.750 --> 00:28.710
Don't tell me you're getting
a piece of that, too.

00:30.540 --> 00:31.749
Everything okay?

00:31.750 --> 00:35.290
The wildfire that hit L.A.
has progressed.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.619
Fossils suggest wildfires
have been igniting

00:39.620 --> 00:43.120
for 420 million years.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.170
I'm...

00:48.710 --> 00:50.499
I'm really glad you snuck out of
your place to sneak into mine

00:50.500 --> 00:52.789
like this... but do we really
still need to sneak?

00:52.790 --> 00:54.419
Dean knows.

00:54.420 --> 00:55.330
Andy knows.

00:55.331 --> 00:56.419
We had a funeral.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.539
It was incredibly sad.

00:58.540 --> 01:02.329
I need a palate cleanser
for all the sad.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.499
Right now.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.709
This planet
is intensely flammable.

01:05.710 --> 01:06.919
Wildfires spark.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.169
And catch.

01:08.170 --> 01:09.040
And grow.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.079
Nearly impossible to control.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.039
So the question is,
at what point

01:13.040 --> 01:15.749
do we stop trying to fight
the fire that's spreading...

01:15.750 --> 01:17.919
and simply surrender to it?

01:17.920 --> 01:20.210
You guys better be packed,
'cause we gotta go. Here.

01:22.170 --> 01:24.039
You got in late last night.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.379
I guess your date with Nikki
went well...?

01:25.380 --> 01:26.669
I still can't believe
I didn't get to meet her.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.829
What if I don't like her?

01:27.830 --> 01:29.879
What if she's not good enough
for you?

01:29.880 --> 01:31.419
Jack and I have opinions,
you know,

01:31.420 --> 01:33.249
about whether or not someone's
up to our standards.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.619
Nope. You do not get to have
any opinions about that.

01:35.620 --> 01:38.959
Some things are for sharing,
and some things are not.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.829
And, heads up,

01:40.830 --> 01:45.079
there's literally just a door
between this room and yours.

01:45.080 --> 01:49.079
So, you guys should know.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.920
Sound carries.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.619
Hey, is the ibuprofen in here?

01:55.620 --> 01:58.249
Yeah.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.459
How're you holding up?

01:59.460 --> 02:00.619
Fine. Tired.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.329
Nursing a funeral-hangover,

02:03.330 --> 02:05.079
which is exactly like
a regular hangover,

02:05.080 --> 02:06.709
only it wasn't preceded
by anything fun.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.378
I'm not feeling my best
today, either.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.579
Sorry, sorry. I'm in the way.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.119
I'll start staying at Travis'
place when we get back.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.419
You and Maya have been so great.

02:15.420 --> 02:19.119
I'm just not ready to go
home-home yet, ya know...

02:19.120 --> 02:20.959
You can stay as long
as you need.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.749
I can't believe we got called
to the fire in L.A.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.289
I've never been deployed

02:25.290 --> 02:27.499
into the middle
of one of these before.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.749
Structure fires are one thing,
but... today?

02:30.750 --> 02:32.749
This is uncharted territory.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.169
Yes, it is.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.289
Sullivan said
bring the essentials.

02:35.290 --> 02:38.039
What did you pack in this thing?

02:38.040 --> 02:40.789
Toothbrush. T-shirts. Underwear.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.500
And every textbook I could find
with a chapter on wildfires.

02:47.620 --> 02:49.169
Fire's only 10% contained?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.119
It's burned over 50,000 acres.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.209
Cal Fire has been fighting it
for a week now.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.289
They need all the help
they can get.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.379
Enter, us.

02:55.380 --> 02:56.459
Lousy timing, though.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.539
Yeah, well, truthfully,

02:57.540 --> 02:58.789
I'm glad to have something
of this scope

02:58.790 --> 03:00.169
to focus on right now.

03:00.170 --> 03:01.999
It's probably good for me, too.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.249
I mean, with this Medic One
oral exam coming up,

03:04.250 --> 03:07.379
I've been trying not to get
too in my head about it...

03:07.380 --> 03:09.579
Can't get in my head when I'm
fighting a wildfire, right?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.119
I probably shouldn't say
anything, but I got a call

03:11.120 --> 03:14.959
from Medical Director Langworthy
asking for my opinion...

03:14.960 --> 03:16.919
about you.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.670
I told him he'd be crazy not to
add you to the Medic One team.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.499
Thank you, sir.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.039
Where do you want our bags?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.250
Just put it right there.

03:35.170 --> 03:37.379
Everybody.
I have something to say.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.919
I've experienced wildfires
in Montana.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.539
Skies will be clouded,
ash will be falling,

03:41.540 --> 03:43.709
you will feel the heat
for miles.

03:43.710 --> 03:46.749
The wind dictates the fire.

03:46.750 --> 03:50.789
But what dictates our survival
is us, this team.

03:50.790 --> 03:51.999
Each of us, together.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.749
I know how intense
it'll be in L.A.

03:54.750 --> 03:59.329
That's why I wanted to say to
all of you now, while I can...

03:59.330 --> 04:00.879
Thank you, in advance,

04:00.880 --> 04:02.830
for facing what you're
about to face.

04:04.210 --> 04:07.669
We lost our Chief
and our friend,

04:07.670 --> 04:09.959
but we are all still here.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.459
Reporting for duty.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.830
And I'm very proud of that.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:24.210 --> 04:26.619
We should let everyone know,
right?

04:26.620 --> 04:28.079
About us?
Everyone's gonna freak out.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.709
They always freak out.

04:29.710 --> 04:30.959
What's Sullivan gonna think?

04:30.960 --> 04:31.790
Is he gonna freak out?

04:31.791 --> 04:32.879
What?

04:32.880 --> 04:35.079
Okay, now I'm freaking out.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.419
Where's Travis?

04:36.420 --> 04:37.210
I've tried calling,
and no answer.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.379
Isn't he coming?

04:38.380 --> 04:39.919
He got himself into some trouble
last night.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.329
Trip's 22 hours long.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.579
We're leaving in 10 minutes,
with him or not.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.880
Is he okay?

04:51.620 --> 04:53.669
You were the last person I
thought I'd see sitting in here.

04:53.670 --> 04:54.789
I shouldn't have gotten
so drunk.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.289
Clearly.

04:56.290 --> 04:57.709
I shouldn't have punched
that guy.

04:57.710 --> 04:59.119
No, you shouldn't have.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.669
Thing last night turned into
a full-blown bar fight.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.169
You're lucky things
didn't get worse.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.619
Sounds like you really did
a number

05:05.620 --> 05:07.879
on that kid's face, Montgomery.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.919
Luckily for you,
his Captain and I go way back.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.619
Can't believe I have to keep
bailing people out

05:14.620 --> 05:15.999
of this place.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.709
You bailed me out one time.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.669
Did you talk to anyone from 19?

05:19.670 --> 05:21.579
19's a little busy.
They've been deployed to assist

05:21.580 --> 05:23.749
with the wildfires
in L.A., so...

05:23.750 --> 05:25.709
Okay, I gotta get outta here
so I can go with them.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.209
Too late to join up with 19.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.209
Andy just texted...
They're already on the road.

05:29.210 --> 05:31.119
I know.
I wish I were going, too.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.920
Well, I need to get on the road.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.419
I just came by to grab
the last of my stuff

05:37.420 --> 05:39.379
before I meet with Jenna
in San Diego.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.419
Tactical Paramedic Program
starts this week.

05:41.420 --> 05:44.709
Wonderful news. We'll come with.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.039
- What?
- L.A.'s on the way.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.459
That's really nice of you
to give us this lift, Tanner.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.289
Thank you. Much appreciated.

05:49.290 --> 05:50.749
Montgomery, let's get packed.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.500
Wait... Wait, what?

05:59.830 --> 06:00.959
You and Gibson?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.379
I hate road trips.

06:02.380 --> 06:04.789
You... You and Gibson.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.379
The information
will stay the same

06:06.380 --> 06:07.669
no matter how many times
you repeat it.

06:07.670 --> 06:08.829
Hey, I need this right now.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.579
Give me this, okay?

06:11.580 --> 06:13.709
Herrera, what about Sullivan?

06:13.710 --> 06:15.749
What... about him?

06:15.750 --> 06:17.579
What is his take on two of his
Lieutenants hooking up?

06:17.580 --> 06:19.789
You're buddies now.
What's he think?

06:19.790 --> 06:21.959
Um, no idea. Never discussed it.

06:21.960 --> 06:26.209
I guess, technically,
it's not a protocol issue,

06:26.210 --> 06:28.119
as you're both the same rank.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.249
Yeah, I mean, who cares, right?

06:31.250 --> 06:32.419
Warren?

06:32.420 --> 06:34.289
No reaction at all?

06:34.290 --> 06:35.879
To? Me and Maya.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.209
Use protection.

06:37.210 --> 06:38.709
Okay, yeah, shouldn't we
be there by now?

06:38.710 --> 06:40.999
We're here.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.379
Wow.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.380
My God.

06:47.170 --> 06:49.000
Here we go.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.709
So it looks like this is Triage,

07:00.710 --> 07:03.749
nearby should be Holding
for evacuees, and then...

07:03.750 --> 07:05.039
Command Center.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.079
Captain Sullivan? Yes.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.289
Incident Commander Nalley.

07:07.290 --> 07:08.669
Thanks for coming down.

07:08.670 --> 07:10.289
We're hovering
at 10% containment.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.499
50,000 acres have burned so far.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.959
We're assigning strike teams
to neighborhoods

07:13.960 --> 07:15.669
that need ground protection.

07:15.670 --> 07:17.669
All right, I know you're all
used to working 24-hour shifts,

07:17.670 --> 07:20.039
but you're also used to comfy
station bunks.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.289
None of those out here.

07:21.290 --> 07:22.959
You'll sleep anyplace you can.
If you can.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.499
Inside rigs, in houses
if you're lucky.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.829
There's no station
to go back to.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.419
This is a marathon.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.380
If you brought turnouts,
put 'em away.

07:29.381 --> 07:31.119
It's too hot.
They'll slow you down.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.579
Your bottles are useless
out here.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.039
If you can breathe at all,
you're alive.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.619
If you can't, you're dead.

07:35.620 --> 07:36.999
Simple as that.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.879
I like this guy.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.169
I'm assigning you to structure
protection on Blue Willow Lane.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.619
I have a unit evac'ing it
right now.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.709
My data says we have a seven-
to ten-hour window

07:44.710 --> 07:47.289
for you to prep the neighborhood
in case the fire jumps our line.

07:47.290 --> 07:48.419
Yes?

07:48.420 --> 07:49.999
And what are the chances
of that happening?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.329
Of the fire jumping the line
into that neighborhood?

07:51.330 --> 07:52.619
If I could predict that,

07:52.620 --> 07:54.920
I wouldn't need you there
to protect it.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.079
All right, we usually
manage one structure.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.329
Today it's a whole neighborhood.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.039
Let's clear out
surrounding brush,

08:18.040 --> 08:20.039
bring all stray furniture
indoors, cover vents,

08:20.040 --> 08:21.079
check gutters, close windows.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.419
Let's go.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.249
I told you. I'm not leaving!

08:24.250 --> 08:26.419
Sir, we need you
to evacuate, okay?

08:26.420 --> 08:27.579
It's not safe up here anymore.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.169
I can't go
without Rumplebum Tankers.

08:30.170 --> 08:31.919
My cat. He ran off.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.749
He won't make it.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.169
I-If... If I leave him and
the fire takes this place...

08:36.169 --> 08:36.880
Miller, c'mon, we've gotta prep.

08:36.881 --> 08:38.328
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

08:38.330 --> 08:40.379
Look, sir, we'll find your cat,
I promise.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.539
I just can't have you risk
your life, too. Yeah?

08:42.539 --> 08:43.919
So if you could just board
this last shuttle,

08:43.919 --> 08:45.120
we'll find your cat.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.119
This is his blanket.

08:50.120 --> 08:55.330
He'll want it.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.210
We'll find your cat.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.169
That's just mean,
promising that sweet old guy

09:06.170 --> 09:07.709
you'll find his cat
when you know full well

09:07.710 --> 09:09.169
that kitty's long gone by now.

09:09.170 --> 09:11.669
We don't know that. Yeah, we do.

09:11.670 --> 09:13.710
Krispie Kitty. Guaranteed.

09:15.170 --> 09:16.290
C'mon. We gotta get to work.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.079
Sir!

09:26.080 --> 09:28.959
This area's under
mandatory evacuation.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.040
You need to clear out.

09:32.710 --> 09:35.579
All due respect, but we're
declining the order.

09:35.580 --> 09:39.459
We've lived in this house
since 1975.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.669
We've been through
three big fires already.

09:41.670 --> 09:44.539
There was '83, '94, -

09:44.540 --> 09:46.119
2006.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.919
The point being, we know how to
take care of ourselves.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.169
Our gas is off, our gutters are
clean, the vents are closed.

09:52.170 --> 09:54.619
I cleared all the brush
from around the house.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.829
These things come through here
every ten years or so,

09:57.830 --> 09:59.039
and we're always ready.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.959
So your property's ready.
That's great.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.459
Now get yourselves to safety.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.999
The other fires were smaller.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.119
Our legs were younger.

10:06.120 --> 10:06.920
She may have a point.

10:06.921 --> 10:08.669
Honey, don't worry.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.619
We got this.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.289
Okay?

10:13.290 --> 10:14.500
We'll be fine.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.119
Here.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.919
Make sure we clear all of this
into the garage.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.500
This stuff acts like tinder.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.419
You know, if you wanted to ask
about Maya,

10:30.420 --> 10:33.539
or if you wanted us to...
To sign something, I mean...

10:33.540 --> 10:35.709
What I want
is to clear this furniture.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.709
Preferably in silence.

10:37.710 --> 10:38.620
I get it. Boundaries.

10:38.621 --> 10:39.670
Not a problem.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.170
You wanna hear how we met?

10:55.790 --> 10:56.879
We're getting close, I think.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.709
Hey, will you quit sitting
on my bag?

10:59.710 --> 11:01.379
Tanner. Relax.

11:01.380 --> 11:02.999
Okay, sure, I'll relax,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.669
as I'm driving toward a wildfire

11:04.670 --> 11:06.879
with all my worldly possessions
in the back seat.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.169
How long you gonna be gone?

11:09.170 --> 11:11.250
A while,
if the program goes well.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.830
What?

11:15.830 --> 11:16.750
I didn't say anything.

11:16.751 --> 11:18.669
Yeah, you did.

11:18.670 --> 11:20.789
"Ryan Tanner,
I'm gonna miss you a lot,"

11:20.790 --> 11:22.959
but I won't say it out loud,
so I'm just gonna grunt

11:22.960 --> 11:25.620
"in lieu of speaking
any of my feelings."

11:26.920 --> 11:29.039
Don't be ridiculous.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.379
We already stopped
being neighbors.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.789
I'm not gonna miss somebody
I already said goodbye to.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.669
Well, you might be surprised.

11:34.670 --> 11:37.879
It takes a minute, moving
forward without someone.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.079
But when you are ready...

11:40.080 --> 11:41.750
it's kind of exciting, actually.

11:45.290 --> 11:47.039
Yeah, well...

11:47.040 --> 11:48.710
Fine. I won't miss you, too.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.079
I like those two.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.539
I think they're pretty dumb
not to evacuate, though.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.959
Well, you know, with all the
money that Jerry and Nina make

11:58.960 --> 12:00.249
renting this place out,

12:00.250 --> 12:01.999
they could cut back the brush
a little bit.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.079
Really.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.419
Not to mention doing something

12:04.420 --> 12:06.000
with all of these
lawn ornaments.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.119
Maria. Maria!

12:15.120 --> 12:16.249
Maria, look. My God.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.829
This place is gonna go up
like a match.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.829
Hey!

12:19.830 --> 12:21.169
Gonna need some help here!

12:21.170 --> 12:23.380
Come here!

12:29.540 --> 12:31.669
19, a gust of embers just
dropped on the northeast part

12:31.670 --> 12:33.499
of this street.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.829
We could use your help
stamping these spot fires out.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.039
Go get under cover!

12:36.040 --> 12:37.379
We'll wet down the yard.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.119
No, honey, do not go
under the porch.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.249
Hey, hey, no, no!

12:40.250 --> 12:41.709
I need you to move
so we can do our job, okay?

12:41.710 --> 12:43.499
No, no, he is right.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.879
It's safer out here where we can
see where they dropped.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.919
If the embers hit the brush
or the gutters,

12:48.920 --> 12:50.379
this whole place is gonna go up
in seconds.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.860
Hey, Herrera, how can we help
you out?

12:55.380 --> 12:57.620
Look out!

13:01.750 --> 13:03.289
This your first wildfire?

13:03.290 --> 13:04.669
It's that obvious?
Yeah, pretty much.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.209
Maria!

13:06.210 --> 13:07.879
I thought the fire
was still miles away!

13:07.880 --> 13:09.079
Where'd all this come from?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.919
It doesn't matter!
We just have to get it out!

13:10.920 --> 13:12.379
Hey, is it just me,

13:12.380 --> 13:16.290
or is that a lot closer
than it was a few minutes ago?

13:19.040 --> 13:21.329
I don't see anyone from 19.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.419
We should find
the Incident Commander.

13:22.420 --> 13:23.619
Montgomery, you check in here.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.000
We'll check in the command tent.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.040
Hang on. I can help.

13:39.670 --> 13:41.330
I got it.

13:45.540 --> 13:48.919
Dry heaving, GCS less than 6...
Possible head injury.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.039
We should get ready for...

13:51.040 --> 13:53.419
Seizure precautions. Great.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.419
Okay.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.499
Okay, we should try to stop
this seizure with,

13:57.500 --> 13:59.459
some midazolam.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.960
Yeah, good call.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.499
Okay.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.079
Okay, seizure's subsided.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.379
Quick, we should, set up for...

14:13.380 --> 14:14.919
Intubation. You got it.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.920
I'm going in.

14:20.670 --> 14:22.209
Damn it. I can't...

14:22.210 --> 14:23.289
I can't get a clear look
at his...

14:23.290 --> 14:24.710
Thanks.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.920
Thank God.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.919
Patient suffered a seizure
and aspirated,

14:54.920 --> 14:55.880
but we administered midazolam.

14:55.881 --> 14:57.040
Okay, thank you.

15:00.750 --> 15:01.880
Good work.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.459
I didn't realize you can't...

15:08.460 --> 15:09.540
You're... deaf?

15:21.790 --> 15:23.950
I'm sorry. I have no idea
what you're saying right now.

15:33.210 --> 15:35.459
Right, yeah,
you wanna get back to work.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.749
No, what I'm asking is what
direction the wind's shifted

15:37.750 --> 15:39.749
and how fast it's going.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.619
Damn it.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.999
Okay. Then I gotta let
the Seattle team on Blue Willow

15:44.000 --> 15:45.879
know exactly what
you just told me, and fast.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.790
Hang on.

15:46.791 --> 15:48.380
What did he just say?

15:52.460 --> 15:53.959
All the spot fires are out.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.499
Let's, - Let's finish sweeping.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.999
Yep. And locate a cat.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.619
Did I just hear that right?
Yeah, Miller's delusional.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.419
Don't ask.

16:00.420 --> 16:01.749
Herrera, can you hear me?

16:01.750 --> 16:02.959
There's a lotta static,
but I copy, Captain.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.209
Just got word from base.

16:04.210 --> 16:05.619
Winds have been shifting.

16:05.620 --> 16:08.249
Yeah, no kidding.
We just got pelted by embers.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.459
So what's the status?
Do we need to pull out of here?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.879
Negative... because we can't.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.539
The winds that blew those embers

16:14.540 --> 16:16.919
blocked off the only road in
and out of this neighborhood.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.829
Spread the word, over.

16:18.830 --> 16:20.249
So we're completely on our own.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.789
U-Use our house.

16:21.790 --> 16:23.209
It can be your base
of operations.

16:23.210 --> 16:24.709
It's your safest bet.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.249
Terry, this is way worse
than the other fires.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.459
We should've gone.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.880
We should've left when we could.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.039
Here, hang on, hang on.
Be careful.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.539
It's okay. It's okay. Calm down.

16:35.540 --> 16:36.829
The air is dry.
It's full of ash.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.249
The air quality's getting worse
by the minute.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.850
You're okay, Maria.
Let's get you inside.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.709
Sit down, sit down.

16:43.710 --> 16:46.039
She has asthma, but she hasn't
had an attack in years.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.169
It's okay. I've got her.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.120
No need to worry.

16:48.121 --> 16:49.709
Maria, breathe for me, please.

16:49.710 --> 16:52.169
Do you use an inhaler?
Are you on any steroids?

16:52.170 --> 16:53.749
How can I help? W-What can I do?

16:53.750 --> 16:56.289
Terry, for God's sakes, you left
half a yard of brush out there.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.829
Honey...
You've got to go clear it away.

16:58.830 --> 17:00.579
Okay, I'll finish up
at the Larsons'.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.249
It shouldn't take too long.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.079
Half of their yard
is a pool anyway.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.329
I'll be right back
as soon as I can.

17:05.329 --> 17:07.329
And, please... just help her.

17:07.329 --> 17:08.329
Please.

17:12.670 --> 17:14.039
Copy that.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.459
Andy wants us to regroup
back at the house.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.039
Yeah, but we still haven't found
the cat.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.709
And we won't. Cat's gone.

17:18.710 --> 17:21.539
He's in some junkyard singing
songs about memories by now.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.039
That's not funny.
I'm being serious.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.249
Yeah, so am I.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.419
This cat is a waste of time.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.420
We have bigger things
to worry about...

17:26.421 --> 17:27.829
Actual human lives
to prioritize.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.079
The cat is in the woods.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.169
Woods are burning.

17:30.170 --> 17:31.289
Cat's toast. Let's move on.

17:31.290 --> 17:32.619
Okay, that's dark.

17:32.620 --> 17:35.039
And I've been letting it slide
all day because I get it.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.459
I understand why you're going
so dark.

17:37.460 --> 17:38.879
But that just gives me
all the more reason

17:38.880 --> 17:40.619
to find that frickin' cat

17:40.620 --> 17:43.669
and prove to you that on top
of all of that darkness,

17:43.670 --> 17:45.789
a little frickin' good
can still happen, too.

17:45.790 --> 17:46.790
What's he doing?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.380
No, no, no, really, guys.
What is he doing?

17:54.250 --> 17:55.459
- Terry!
- Terry, wait, no!

17:55.460 --> 17:57.209
Aah!

17:57.210 --> 17:59.289
Get me out of here!

17:59.290 --> 18:00.879
Terry, just try to
stay calm, okay?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.579
Captain, this is Hughes.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.329
We got a civilian with his arm
caught inside the brush cutter.

18:04.330 --> 18:05.999
Is there any way to get
a medi-vac out here?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.669
I can ask,

18:07.670 --> 18:09.999
but I'll guarantee visibility's
too low to get a bird up.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.419
Keep the patient stable.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.420
I'm on the other side
of the neighborhood,

18:12.421 --> 18:14.289
but I'm on my way. So stupid.

18:14.290 --> 18:15.329
There was still tension
in the rotor.

18:15.330 --> 18:16.749
I never should've tried to cut
the wire.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.209
I was just in a hurry.

18:18.210 --> 18:19.829
Aah!
I can't see the wound from here,

18:19.830 --> 18:21.419
but his hand is pretty jammed
in there.

18:21.420 --> 18:22.879
Heart rate is racing.
His skin is cold and clammy.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.419
He's going
into hypovolemic shock.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.709
That should slow
the bleeding a little,

18:25.710 --> 18:27.669
but he still needs IV fluids,
epi, painkillers.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.919
And I need a toolkit. We've got
to take these rotors apart.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.829
All right, I'm gonna run back to the
Engine to get a jump bag and tools.

18:31.830 --> 18:34.000
Terry, you just hang on
'til I get back, okay?

18:37.830 --> 18:39.379
Sullivan didn't freak out.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.039
What? He didn't ask questions.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.709
Didn't care.
That's a good thing, right?

18:43.710 --> 18:44.829
Warren didn't seem to care,
either.

18:44.830 --> 18:46.709
Aha! Inhaler.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.169
Do you think it's because
they think we won't last?

18:48.170 --> 18:49.329
Do you think we won't last?

18:49.330 --> 18:51.289
We have a patient
who can't breathe

18:51.290 --> 18:53.209
and a massive fire to deal with.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.790
This can wait.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.789
Terry? Terry!

18:57.790 --> 18:58.829
He's lost consciousness.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.749
I've got the bags.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.170
He's going into shock.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.249
BP's crashing.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.379
This thing won't budge.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.459
How long until he's free?

19:12.460 --> 19:13.879
We need to get him
stabilized now.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.169
Five, ten minutes. Maybe more.

19:15.170 --> 19:16.289
Can he last that long?

19:16.290 --> 19:17.329
There's no room to properly
tourniquet.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.619
He keeps losing blood.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.329
I-I don't think so.

19:20.330 --> 19:21.709
Well, the fluids can get
his pressure back up.

19:21.710 --> 19:22.710
Give the meds time to work.

19:22.711 --> 19:23.749
We gotta get his hand out.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.249
It's gonna take the time
that it takes.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.619
We can't get him out any faster.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.789
Unless...

19:28.790 --> 19:30.080
Unless we amputate.

19:36.580 --> 19:37.999
Can you finish
before he bleeds out?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.749
No, we cannot do that.
We follow protocol.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.539
Give him supportive therapy
until we clear the rotors,

19:41.540 --> 19:42.749
treat the wound,
and get him to the hospital.

19:42.750 --> 19:45.289
There is no hospital.

19:45.290 --> 19:48.079
We are on our own,
and he's running out of time.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.249
If we remove the hand
at the wrist,

19:49.250 --> 19:50.959
we can staunch the bleeding
immediately.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.039
If we wait,
he will bleed out and die.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.249
You don't know that!

19:53.250 --> 19:54.709
We can't even get inside
the rotors to know if we...

19:54.710 --> 19:56.079
Okay, look, look.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.829
Under normal circumstances,
we'd be calling Medic One

19:57.830 --> 19:59.999
or a surgical team, and they
would help us make this call.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.709
Warren, you're a surgeon.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.209
What would surgeon Ben do
right now?

20:03.210 --> 20:05.749
I have seen patients bleed out
in less time

20:05.750 --> 20:07.470
than it's gonna take for us
to get him free.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.919
It's a choice between his hand
and his life.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.000
I choose life.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.709
Can you even operate out here?

20:14.710 --> 20:15.959
Do you have the right tools?

20:15.960 --> 20:17.169
His bones are already broken.

20:17.170 --> 20:19.039
His arm's held together
by tendons.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.420
That's easier to cut through.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.329
Listen, his crit has been
dangerously low,

20:30.330 --> 20:33.670
so if we're gonna do this,
it needs to be now.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Okay.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.080
Warren!
What the hell are you doing?

20:51.540 --> 20:53.329
Keep your eye on his vitals.

20:53.330 --> 20:54.579
We need strong circulation.

20:54.580 --> 20:55.789
Watch his airway
in case we have to intubate.

20:55.790 --> 20:57.329
BP is dropping.
We gave him a lot of fluids.

20:57.330 --> 20:58.789
I'm worried
about too much dilution.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.459
Let's hang a bag of dopamine,
try to get it back up.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.959
Start with five mikes. Yeah.

21:01.960 --> 21:02.790
Here, I'll make more space.

21:02.790 --> 21:03.540
What else do you need?

21:03.541 --> 21:05.039
Get pain meds, fresh gauze.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.329
Put him in Trendelenburg.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.539
Are you sure we can't get him
to a hospital?

21:07.540 --> 21:08.919
He needs irrigation
and debridement.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.119
He could be at risk
for an embolism.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.079
We are an island here, Hughes.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.670
We gotta treat him here.

21:21.170 --> 21:22.500
His heart rate's coming back up.

21:23.710 --> 21:26.379
What did you do to my husband?

21:26.380 --> 21:27.959
There was an accident.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.749
Um, he was injured, and we had
to... I had to take his hand.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.579
But, - But it saved his life.

21:32.580 --> 21:36.120
My God. My God.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.039
You actually took it?

21:42.040 --> 21:43.289
There was...
There was no choice, sir.

21:43.290 --> 21:45.499
God.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.539
We'll take it from here.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.539
But, sir, I had to... I said...

21:48.540 --> 21:51.459
Sir... we'll take it from here.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.999
Go.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.580
Ice.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.419
Hey. Are you okay?

22:12.420 --> 22:14.419
No. No, we just cut
a guy's hand off.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.829
The world is burning up
all around us.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.209
It rained fire.

22:17.210 --> 22:20.079
Lucas is dead. I'm not okay.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.999
I'm dark.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.329
And I can't see the light.

22:23.330 --> 22:24.930
Everywhere I look,
dark is all I can see.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.380
Old Rumplebum Tankers!

22:34.080 --> 22:36.749
It is Rumplebum Tankers!

22:36.750 --> 22:37.789
Now, see?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.169
Everything is not dark.

22:39.170 --> 22:40.040
Good things happen.

22:40.041 --> 22:41.789
A good thing just happened.

22:41.790 --> 22:42.670
That cat does not prove
your point.

22:42.671 --> 22:44.249
It's a cat.

22:44.250 --> 22:45.539
All that proves is that
even animals know

22:45.540 --> 22:47.039
it's too unsafe
to be outside right now,

22:47.040 --> 22:48.419
and even the most
vigilant survivalists

22:48.420 --> 22:49.669
forgot to clamp up
their damn pet door,

22:49.670 --> 22:50.879
which is number one
on the list of things

22:50.880 --> 22:53.040
to secure in a wildfire.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.960
You know, I'm gonna go check
on our patient.

22:58.790 --> 23:00.209
There's got to be a way
to get to 19.

23:00.210 --> 23:01.040
But there isn't.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.789
Fire's blocking all access.

23:02.790 --> 23:04.959
But for now, at least, it hasn't
hit the neighborhood itself,

23:04.960 --> 23:08.379
so 19 is protected
at the moment... just isolated.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.120
There's no need to panic yet.

23:11.420 --> 23:13.789
He says not to panic,
but I'm panicking...

23:13.790 --> 23:15.170
pretty much totally panicking.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.669
Yeah, staying busy's good.

23:19.670 --> 23:20.709
Let's work.

23:20.710 --> 23:21.879
All right, we're still
in our civvies.

23:21.880 --> 23:23.640
We should wear our badges.
I'll go grab them.

23:27.790 --> 23:29.419
Badges should be
in these other bags, right?

23:29.420 --> 23:31.209
I don't know why this one
is in here.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.210
Tanner.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.749
Listen, it's not what it
looks like.

23:34.750 --> 23:37.289
Pretty sure it is. Pretty sure
I know where you got it, too.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.499
You still in touch
with your dad?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.119
Look, I didn't ask for it.
It's a long story.

23:40.120 --> 23:43.459
If it's marked and you spend it,
you know they will find you.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.669
And don't let some bad decision
your dad made

23:45.670 --> 23:48.419
drag you down with it.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.039
I'm sure it's tempting
to keep that cash,

23:50.040 --> 23:51.789
but you need to get rid of it
and get rid of it fast.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.249
What do you expect me
to do with it?

23:53.250 --> 23:55.209
We're in the middle
of a wildfire.

23:55.210 --> 23:57.330
Use your imagination.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.079
I-I know what I did was extreme,

24:05.080 --> 24:07.829
but I-I thought it was the right
thing to do in the moment.

24:07.830 --> 24:09.379
I thought... I mean, it was.

24:09.380 --> 24:12.669
All right, but... his life
will never be the same.

24:12.670 --> 24:14.539
Because of me.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.460
He has a life because of you.

24:18.830 --> 24:20.250
Hold onto that.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.619
We should start our sweeps.

24:24.620 --> 24:26.829
Check for any flare ups,
more embers, anything.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.749
I-I thought I'd go first.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.250
I'm going with you.

24:45.540 --> 24:48.039
How are you feeling?

24:48.040 --> 24:51.249
Fuzzy. I don't know.

24:51.250 --> 24:54.209
I don't feel very much
right now, I guess.

24:54.210 --> 24:56.499
So, that's something.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.669
That's the pain meds.

24:59.670 --> 25:01.039
I need to redress your wound.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.170
If your pain level goes up,
you let me know, okay?

25:08.250 --> 25:14.079
I try to be so strong,
for Maria.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.249
I always have, our whole lives.

25:16.250 --> 25:18.330
It comforts her.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.669
What am I gonna do now?

25:24.670 --> 25:27.289
With no hand.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.580
Without a...

25:32.920 --> 25:36.380
Don't let her
come in here yet, please.

25:39.710 --> 25:42.250
I don't want her to see me
like this.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.170
It feels impossible.

25:50.790 --> 25:53.000
When you lose something
that's so much a part of you.

25:54.960 --> 25:59.169
Impossible to see what the next
day could possibly look like.

25:59.170 --> 26:00.959
Or the next.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.250
I don't know how to do this.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.419
I'm scared.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.789
I'd be worried if you weren't.

26:09.790 --> 26:12.330
I'm never scared.

26:16.460 --> 26:21.539
I know things seem really dark
right now.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.209
But good things will happen
again, too.

26:23.210 --> 26:24.419
You don't know that.

26:24.420 --> 26:25.749
No.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.669
But I hope it.

26:27.670 --> 26:31.039
How?

26:31.040 --> 26:32.210
Why?

26:37.210 --> 26:39.750
Because if I don't,
what's the alternative?

26:44.750 --> 26:47.080
Do you hear that?

26:49.250 --> 26:50.879
It sounds like it could be
raining or hailing,

26:50.880 --> 26:52.119
but, I mean, it can't be.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.960
That's not rain.

27:00.710 --> 27:03.669
Guys, fire's here!

27:03.670 --> 27:04.749
Keep clear of the windows
and doors!

27:04.750 --> 27:05.920
The fire's here!

27:09.120 --> 27:11.879
Winds have shifted east...
I say again, winds are shifting!

27:11.880 --> 27:13.079
Does anyone copy?

27:13.080 --> 27:14.829
You've lost radio contact?

27:14.830 --> 27:16.169
Yeah, I've been trying to get
in touch with your people

27:16.170 --> 27:17.120
to let them know that
the fire's spreading

27:17.121 --> 27:18.419
toward Blue Willow Lane,

27:18.420 --> 27:20.169
but the conditions
are causing interference.

27:20.170 --> 27:21.499
So what do we do?
Well, they know the drill.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.169
Haul up, stay inside,
wait for backup.

27:23.170 --> 27:25.329
Which will be when?
Air tankers are refueling.

27:25.330 --> 27:27.079
We're hoping maybe they'll do
a fly-by from above.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.999
- Hoping?
- Refueling takes so long.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.959
The roads are
completely blocked by fire.

27:30.960 --> 27:31.960
There's no other way
to get to them.

27:31.961 --> 27:33.579
Yes, there is.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.169
He says he's worked this area
before. There's another way.

27:35.170 --> 27:36.120
No, we're just gonna
get on the radio

27:36.120 --> 27:37.040
and try to get them that way.

27:37.041 --> 27:39.249
Hey! There is another way in.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.459
Or out, maybe.
I'm not exactly sure,

27:41.460 --> 27:43.919
but if he has an exit strategy
that will save lives,

27:43.920 --> 27:46.040
we need to hear it.

27:47.790 --> 27:49.579
Now, he's traced
what looks like a-a back road

27:49.580 --> 27:50.829
through the county line?

27:50.830 --> 27:52.789
No, I can't risk any of
my people going down

27:52.790 --> 27:54.669
an unmarked trail
and getting caught in the fire.

27:54.670 --> 27:57.289
It would be suicide. Then we don't go in.
If we can re-establish comms,

27:57.290 --> 27:58.250
we tell them how to
get themselves out.

27:58.251 --> 28:00.329
If we had communications.
But we don't.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.959
The signal is too weak
for this mess.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.289
Then we'll make it stronger.

28:03.290 --> 28:04.920
I'm gonna need that.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.079
Move, move!

28:09.080 --> 28:11.210
Aah!

28:15.330 --> 28:17.000
We won't make it back in time.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.120
We'll find coverage
in that house.

28:29.540 --> 28:32.000
Aah. The fire's coming.

28:33.830 --> 28:35.579
Come on! Come on.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.920
I'm good. I'm good.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.879
See, I don't open up
to many people.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.879
With you, it's easy.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.459
I-I feel the same.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.999
Could that be a bright spot,
too?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.579
Have you? Let go, of the past?

29:26.580 --> 29:28.290
Getting there.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.669
Careful.

30:00.670 --> 30:02.039
The air could still
burn our lungs.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.170
Stay close to the surface.

30:06.750 --> 30:08.290
Fire everywhere.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.919
There.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.709
There's an opening.

30:13.710 --> 30:16.459
If we're quick, maybe we can
make it through.

30:16.460 --> 30:18.459
Have to be.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.380
Or our boots will melt.

30:23.710 --> 30:25.000
Let's go.

30:28.330 --> 30:30.419
Why is this gonna go through
better than the radios?

30:30.420 --> 30:32.379
I've been reading up on
emergency communication systems

30:32.380 --> 30:34.039
to prep for training
in San Diego.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.709
I saw the Cellular On Wheels
tower outside.

30:35.710 --> 30:36.879
We can use its signal.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.039
That's only effective on devices

30:38.040 --> 30:39.579
that are connected
to that signal.

30:39.580 --> 30:41.789
I know, but maybe the Seattle
software is compatible with L.A.

30:41.790 --> 30:42.959
It's worth a shot.

30:42.960 --> 30:43.960
So you think their tower
is gonna activate

30:43.961 --> 30:45.209
our emergency comm devices?

30:45.210 --> 30:46.289
Isn't that a long shot?

30:46.290 --> 30:47.379
It's not gonna hurt.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.880
Okay, let's try it.

30:50.830 --> 30:52.079
It's ringing.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.170
Now let's just hope
they pick up.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.169
Andy and Sullivan are
caught outside in this.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.249
We need to go look for them.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.329
Fire hit the south side
of the house.

31:01.330 --> 31:02.459
We can't stay here much longer.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.879
- We need to exit.
- And exit fast.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.459
Exit to where?

31:06.460 --> 31:08.579
- Hello?
- There you are, thank God.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.289
Captain, is that you? Where on
Earth did you come from?

31:10.290 --> 31:11.539
Stop talking. There's no time.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.080
Listen carefully.

31:15.710 --> 31:17.959
Keep hold of me.
Visibility's so low.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.420
I'm here. Keep going.

31:27.080 --> 31:27.830
We're coming! We're here!

31:27.831 --> 31:28.920
Hey!

31:34.790 --> 31:36.119
Where is everyone else?

31:36.120 --> 31:37.540
Behind us
piled in the other Engine.

31:39.790 --> 31:41.169
Where are we headed?

31:41.170 --> 31:43.459
Not entirely sure.
Everybody hang on.

31:43.460 --> 31:44.879
Captain Herrera,
we're heading west now.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.539
Tell me where I'm going!

31:46.540 --> 31:47.669
Can you see street signs?

31:47.670 --> 31:49.669
You're looking for
an Avalon Street.

31:49.670 --> 31:52.120
Negative. Visibility is at zero.

31:53.790 --> 31:55.329
Engine's starting to
handle strangely.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.119
I think the wheels
are starting to melt.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.829
There's someone with us
who knows the area.

31:58.830 --> 32:02.249
He says there's a hiking path
right off that street.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.329
Supposedly big enough for a car.

32:04.330 --> 32:06.789
Says it's next to a house
with big flowers.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.579
Big flowers.

32:08.580 --> 32:10.499
Turn around.
I know where that is.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.919
What? The... The lawn
ornaments, the flowers...

32:12.920 --> 32:15.419
I can get us to that house
if you can get us on that road.

32:15.420 --> 32:17.289
How? We can't see a thing.

32:17.290 --> 32:18.499
Okay, let's do this.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.500
Bishop.

32:22.170 --> 32:24.750
Bishop, talk to me.
Did you find it?

32:26.330 --> 32:27.879
There! There!
We... We found the house.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.209
Now, turn.

32:29.210 --> 32:30.579
Turn now?
I don't... I don't know.

32:30.580 --> 32:31.919
My God. My God.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.710
Leap of faith. Turning now, sir!

32:47.170 --> 32:49.169
My God. There's a road.

32:49.170 --> 32:51.130
- Holy mother, you found it.
- I don't believe it.

32:54.620 --> 32:57.419
The ambulance
is ready to take you.

32:57.420 --> 32:59.579
I wish we could've
saved your house.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.539
No.

33:01.540 --> 33:04.459
I-I don't want to intrude,

33:04.460 --> 33:07.459
but, we recovered this
on the scene.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.250
I... wanted to make sure to
g-get it back to you.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.290
Lookit.

33:22.670 --> 33:24.539
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:24.540 --> 33:27.169
Have you... Have you seen
an older gentleman?

33:27.170 --> 33:30.579
His name is, George...
George... something.

33:30.580 --> 33:32.499
He... He's very sweet.
He's wearing a plaid sweater.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.379
70s? Balding? Yeah.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.749
Yeah, poor guy
dropped about an hour ago.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.709
Cardiac arrest, I think?

33:38.710 --> 33:41.789
I'm not sure he even made it
to the hospital.

33:41.790 --> 33:43.879
You mean he... he...

33:43.880 --> 33:45.329
You found Rumplebum Tankers?

33:45.330 --> 33:48.670
Yes!

33:53.170 --> 33:55.289
What's it gonna be like

33:55.290 --> 33:57.329
without you living around
the corner from me anymore?

33:57.330 --> 33:59.669
It's hard to imagine.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.329
You moved on first.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.919
We haven't been
around the corner in a while.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.960
I guess that's true.

34:06.880 --> 34:10.119
Well...

34:10.120 --> 34:11.250
be safe.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.540
Yeah. You, too.

34:30.290 --> 34:31.879
Gibson, you know sign language?

34:31.880 --> 34:33.290
Yeah. What, you don't?

34:38.460 --> 34:40.168
What'd he say? Is it about me?
Does he like me?

34:40.170 --> 34:42.460
No, forget I asked that.
I'm not 12.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.619
Um, he has noticed you.

34:50.620 --> 34:53.829
I think you definitely made
a good impression.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.329
And, this is just me talking,

34:55.330 --> 34:57.119
but if I were you,
I'd... I'd kiss this dude.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.120
Like, right now.

35:00.670 --> 35:02.830
Jack...

35:50.880 --> 35:52.919
Um, amazing news.

35:52.920 --> 35:56.959
The fire is now 80% contained,
and Nikki just parked.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.169
So, brunch? Brunch? Brunch?

35:58.170 --> 35:59.170
- God, yes.
- Yeah.

35:59.171 --> 36:00.999
Nice. We survived a firestorm,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.789
I'm finally
getting to meet Nikki,

36:02.790 --> 36:04.669
and now you're throwing in
waffles?

36:04.670 --> 36:06.119
It's like the perfect day.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.379
Yeah, it makes sense
you'd want to double date

36:07.380 --> 36:08.539
since Bishop and I are kind of

36:08.540 --> 36:11.169
the station's "it" couple
right now.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.419
Hello?

36:13.420 --> 36:14.789
Hey!

36:14.790 --> 36:16.080
Hello.

36:19.750 --> 36:22.920
Come. You got to meet
Jack's much better half.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.169
Nicole?

36:25.170 --> 36:27.329
Maya. Hi.

36:27.330 --> 36:28.499
Whoa.
You two already know each other?

36:28.500 --> 36:30.999
Yeah.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.750
Um, we've met before.

36:34.250 --> 36:36.880
She's my ex.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.170
You're never gonna
see it coming.

36:43.420 --> 36:44.539
Hello.

36:44.540 --> 36:45.919
Thank you.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.500
Ben Warren, Station 19.

36:49.830 --> 36:52.709
Is, - is everything all right?

36:52.710 --> 36:54.379
One minute, everything's calm...

36:54.380 --> 36:55.539
We've been made aware
of something

36:55.540 --> 36:57.379
we'd like you to verify.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.119
Is it true that
you recently performed

36:59.120 --> 37:00.789
an unsanctioned
field amputation?

37:00.790 --> 37:03.289
The next,
you're staring down a wildfire.

37:03.290 --> 37:06.539
Um, I-I did perform
an emergent procedure.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.289
Um, it was a success.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.919
I'm happy to report
the patient lived.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.669
Did you have permission
from Medical Control

37:12.670 --> 37:13.959
for this procedure?

37:13.960 --> 37:16.459
Well, no.
I was in Los Angeles, and...

37:16.460 --> 37:18.419
Did the patient give consent?

37:18.420 --> 37:20.249
Well, if you let me
explain the situation...

37:20.250 --> 37:22.460
A simple yes or no will do.

37:23.790 --> 37:25.959
Um, no.

37:25.960 --> 37:29.079
You didn't have
a sterile operating field

37:29.080 --> 37:30.749
and no access to post-op care.

37:30.750 --> 37:31.919
Is that correct?

37:31.920 --> 37:33.999
Well, there were
extenuating circumstances...

37:34.000 --> 37:36.879
Mr. Warren, we follow
very specific

37:36.880 --> 37:38.539
patient care guidelines
here at Medic One.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.379
We are strict
about those guidelines

37:40.380 --> 37:43.039
because members of Medic One
are given hefty responsibility,

37:43.040 --> 37:44.959
making judgment calls

37:44.960 --> 37:47.169
with life-or-death stakes
all the time.

37:47.170 --> 37:50.209
They face extenuating
circumstances almost every call,

37:50.210 --> 37:53.999
so we need to make sure
that our members

37:54.000 --> 37:56.619
aren't predisposed to being rash
with this responsibility.

37:56.620 --> 38:00.079
We don't want
and we don't need any cowboys.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.329
I-I agree, and I assure you

38:02.330 --> 38:03.579
this decision was not
made lightly...

38:03.580 --> 38:05.539
We decided to take a closer look
at your record,

38:05.540 --> 38:09.249
including your surgical career,
and...

38:09.250 --> 38:11.329
it looks like you have a history

38:11.330 --> 38:14.329
with "extenuating
circumstances," so...

38:14.330 --> 38:17.710
we'd like to talk about that.

38:20.040 --> 38:23.539
Wildfires don't play nice.

38:23.540 --> 38:26.500
They don't stop and pause
and wait until you're ready.

38:29.330 --> 38:31.169
Dylan's hot.

38:31.170 --> 38:34.459
Hot, hot, hot.

38:34.460 --> 38:38.379
Okay, you need to sleep,
not hear about my love life.

38:38.380 --> 38:42.169
Which remains nonexistent.

38:42.170 --> 38:43.829
I feel bad even bringing up
some new guy

38:43.830 --> 38:47.919
while we're standing here
doing... whatever this is.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.119
No, don't put your life
and happiness

38:51.120 --> 38:53.499
and amazingly handsome

38:53.500 --> 38:56.619
potential long-distance
deaf lover on hold

38:56.620 --> 39:00.000
because you're worried about me
and this bed I ca...

39:02.710 --> 39:05.419
Don't delay your happy
'cause mine's been messed up.

39:05.420 --> 39:07.789
Go after it. Text it.

39:07.790 --> 39:08.959
In fact, you know what?

39:08.960 --> 39:11.619
Hell, I will text it for you
right now.

39:11.620 --> 39:15.790
"Hey, it's me, Travis.
From the wildfire..."

39:17.620 --> 39:19.329
What do you even text to a man
who looks like a sculpture?

39:19.330 --> 39:21.039
Give me... no. You!

39:21.040 --> 39:22.750
Did you send it?

39:25.290 --> 39:26.329
All right, you're out.

39:26.330 --> 39:27.379
Yeah. No.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.820
Too late.
You're going into time-out.

39:33.960 --> 39:37.670
If conditions are right,
wildfires will just grow.

39:43.960 --> 39:48.999
Hey, you know, the pool was our
second near-death experience.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.169
Hey, um, I wanted to explain...

39:52.170 --> 39:54.879
I-I wanted to say something,
too.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.619
Okay, great. You go first.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.579
No, you... y-you wanted...

39:59.580 --> 40:02.880
Right, but what...
What do you want?

40:11.880 --> 40:14.170
They burn hotter
than most other fires.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.830
Wakey, wakey. Food's here.

40:26.210 --> 40:27.789
I thought you were ramen.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.379
Travis Montgomery. Yeah.

40:29.380 --> 40:30.709
The man you attacked
two nights ago

40:30.710 --> 40:32.459
has been in the hospital
ever since.

40:32.460 --> 40:34.459
He's pressing charges.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.419
You're under arrest for
the assault and battery

40:36.420 --> 40:38.249
of Jeremy Heffington.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.790
Their burn is more destructive.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.540
You can't play with
this kind of fire...

41:16.710 --> 41:17.789
Hang on.

41:17.790 --> 41:20.000
I'm locking the door.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.420
Or it'll consume you.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.580
Everything okay?

41:38.500 --> 41:40.789
Andy, I...

41:40.790 --> 41:44.420
I think it's best if you... go.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.420
Um...

41:53.420 --> 41:55.579
Okay.

41:55.580 --> 41:58.620
So when you find yourself
staring a wildfire down...

42:03.620 --> 42:06.499
when you can't breathe,
can't walk,

42:06.500 --> 42:09.290
when you're hurting so much
you're actually numb...

42:12.830 --> 42:16.499
just remember,

42:16.500 --> 42:21.289
wildfires may not play nice...

42:21.290 --> 42:23.500
but neither do you.
