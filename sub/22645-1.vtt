02:04.792 --> 02:07.876
During the reign
of Ming Emperor Jiajing (1522-1567),

02:07.917 --> 02:11.459
Japanese pirates raided the coastlines

02:11.501 --> 02:13.167
of China because of the sea ban.

02:13.876 --> 02:17.167
The chief of these Japanese pirates

02:17.209 --> 02:21.751
was actually a Han Chinese man named Wang Zhi.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.792
In 1557,

02:24.792 --> 02:26.542
the Zhejiang commander led Wang

02:26.542 --> 02:30.167
to turn against the pirates.

02:30.417 --> 02:35.042
But Wang was subsequently imprisoned
by the Governor of Hangzhou.

02:35.084 --> 02:39.417
So the pirates continued
to raid the coastal areas of Zhejiang.

02:40.084 --> 02:43.376
Wang's godson, Mao Haifeng,

02:43.709 --> 02:46.001
and over 1,000 pirates

02:46.209 --> 02:47.876
occupied Cengang with the loot pillaged

02:48.334 --> 02:52.376
from the coast.

02:53.376 --> 02:57.709
The army under Commander
Yu Dayou besieged them for 5 months.

03:08.709 --> 03:15.834
(God of War)

03:34.251 --> 03:37.042
(Yu Dayou)
(Garrison Commander of Zhejiang)

04:25.584 --> 04:26.501
Charge.!

04:47.084 --> 04:49.084
Fire!.

05:05.126 --> 05:06.126
Charge.!

05:43.501 --> 05:45.667
General!

05:46.292 --> 05:47.376
General!

05:48.001 --> 05:49.834
Are you alright?

05:50.501 --> 05:52.167
We can't hold them off!.

05:52.626 --> 05:53.292
We should fall back.

06:00.917 --> 06:01.792
Retreat!.

06:43.959 --> 06:44.751
Sir,

06:45.042 --> 06:47.417
like fools,

06:47.667 --> 06:50.292
they launch their attacks
at the same hour each time.

06:51.626 --> 06:52.876
Guns Unit dismissed.!

06:55.417 --> 06:57.376
They eat,

06:57.751 --> 07:01.084
attack, and retreat like clockwork.

07:01.417 --> 07:04.542
The Ming troops have such discipline!

07:05.834 --> 07:06.626
Sir,

07:06.876 --> 07:09.251
the ronins get all the credit.

07:09.376 --> 07:11.792
Won't the soldiers feel snubbed?

07:11.834 --> 07:12.584
Thank you.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.876
The ronins are sufficient

07:17.334 --> 07:19.376
to take on the Ming troops.

07:20.501 --> 07:22.667
If these troops are so pathetic,

07:23.001 --> 07:25.417
why didn't you invade the inland

07:25.876 --> 07:28.542
and force the Ming Court to release my godfather?

07:32.251 --> 07:33.334
General,

07:33.876 --> 07:36.417
have you forgotten what Lord Matsura said?

07:37.792 --> 07:39.042
Haifeng,

07:39.876 --> 07:41.334
no need to remind me.

07:42.417 --> 07:43.667
We're aware of Master Wufeng's (Wang Zhi)

07:44.292 --> 07:49.917
contribution to the Matsura clan.

07:50.751 --> 07:51.626
But

07:52.209 --> 07:54.042
Lord Matsura made it clear

07:54.084 --> 07:55.917
we're not acting on his behalf.

07:56.584 --> 07:59.334
We're wokou.

07:59.459 --> 08:01.167
We are pirates

08:02.959 --> 08:07.167
under the command of Master Wufeng.

08:10.209 --> 08:16.126
If 60 ronins can reach Nanjing
and defeat the Ming troops,

08:16.792 --> 08:18.709
and we have a regiment of 1,000 men,

08:18.876 --> 08:21.584
why can't we attack?

08:24.209 --> 08:26.709
According to the Art of War,

08:27.751 --> 08:30.626
surround the enemy
when we outnumber them 10 to 1

08:30.709 --> 08:33.583
and attack when it's 5 to 1.

08:34.501 --> 08:36.626
we only managed to hold them off

08:37.208 --> 08:40.917
because we have the benefit of a natural barrier.

08:41.208 --> 08:45.417
Without that edge,

08:46.334 --> 08:48.626
we will lose just the same.

08:49.209 --> 08:53.084
We will end up like those 60 ronins.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.584
Sir,

08:55.251 --> 08:59.084
you have overestimated the Ming troops.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.709
They have 200,000 men stationed in the south

09:03.792 --> 09:07.167
under the command of Yu Dayou.

09:07.667 --> 09:13.001
Ming troops are cowards
and court officials are corrupted.

09:13.292 --> 09:18.459
A few more like Yu Dayou means nothing.

09:21.001 --> 09:22.501
Recently,

09:23.667 --> 09:28.084
a general named Qi Jiguang has emerged

09:28.542 --> 09:31.334
and led the Ming troops to win several battles.

09:33.501 --> 09:35.042
Qi Jiguang?

09:51.001 --> 09:52.084
What are they doing?

09:52.959 --> 09:54.292
Bastards!.

09:57.334 --> 09:58.876
Leave them alone.

09:59.084 --> 10:00.167
Why?

10:01.417 --> 10:02.376
Sensei,

10:02.959 --> 10:07.209
why should samurais fight alongside ronins

10:07.959 --> 10:09.667
and put up with their atrocious behavior?

10:12.667 --> 10:15.042
To each his own.

10:16.292 --> 10:19.084
We came from across the ocean

10:19.876 --> 10:21.584
to help the Daimyo build his fortune

10:21.709 --> 10:25.084
and to buy firearms to make him powerful.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.209
They came here

10:29.417 --> 10:32.084
for women and money.

10:36.584 --> 10:40.126
Their behavior is unworthy of a samurai.

10:40.209 --> 10:43.917
But we must keep them happy

10:43.959 --> 10:46.251
so they will risk their lives for us.

10:48.834 --> 10:52.001
You must remember

10:53.084 --> 10:56.167
we're here to make money and buy weapons

10:56.417 --> 10:59.209
in order Japan can rule the world.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.292
Nothing else matters.

11:03.001 --> 11:05.626
To defeat the Ming Court,

11:07.542 --> 11:12.626
benevolence is not enough. We also need strategy.

11:13.626 --> 11:16.126
When you become the Daimyo, Master Yamagawa,

11:16.292 --> 11:18.584
you can be more benevolent.

11:19.001 --> 11:22.126
If the Ming Court found out that
we are from the Matsura Army,

11:23.667 --> 11:26.167
it would endanger the Matsura clan.

11:27.459 --> 11:30.292
We're pirates,

11:34.084 --> 11:37.209
savage pirates.

11:38.292 --> 11:41.417
Do you understand?

11:56.042 --> 11:57.209
General Yu!.

11:57.667 --> 11:58.542
Commander Hu.!

11:58.751 --> 11:59.584
You're injured!.

12:00.626 --> 12:01.542
It's nothing.

12:02.126 --> 12:04.667
I intend to launch another attack before dark.

12:04.792 --> 12:08.751
(Hu Zongxian)
(Supreme Commander of Zhejiang)

12:10.292 --> 12:12.584
What's the use?

12:14.626 --> 12:15.751
General Yu!.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.292
I'm Assistant Regional Military Commissioner,
Qi Jiguang.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.209
So you're Qi Jiguang.

12:22.376 --> 12:23.792
If you think my plan won't work,

12:24.042 --> 12:25.917
what do you suggest?

12:26.042 --> 12:27.376
Nothing yet.

12:28.584 --> 12:33.042
You've been doing this for several months, right?

12:36.834 --> 12:38.001
General Yu,

12:39.417 --> 12:41.709
the Imperial Court is getting impatient.

12:41.876 --> 12:45.167
You have 20 days left of your one-month deadline.

12:45.959 --> 12:47.209
That's why

12:47.751 --> 12:50.876
I intend to let Jiguang give it
a try with his new army.

12:51.126 --> 12:52.292
They have wiped out pirates

12:52.334 --> 12:55.251
in western Zhejiang in 3 successive battles.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.209
General Yu,

13:02.126 --> 13:05.334
you have been fighting for months.

13:06.376 --> 13:08.042
You must be exhausted.

13:08.417 --> 13:11.959
Besides, most of your men are trained at sea...

13:13.042 --> 13:14.834
I will follow your orders.

13:15.376 --> 13:16.876
There's no need to explain.

13:18.459 --> 13:19.376
(Lu Tong)
(Second Commander of Zhejiang)

13:19.417 --> 13:22.876
Commander Hu only wants you to rest up.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.501
Let's go, General Lu!

13:26.792 --> 13:27.667
Let's go for a drink.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.001
Sure! After you...

13:45.042 --> 13:46.042
Jiguang,

13:46.917 --> 13:50.084
I want you to take the lead.

13:51.167 --> 13:53.417
I'll do my best.

14:18.042 --> 14:21.834
(A few months ago)

14:23.042 --> 14:27.251
(Longshang, Cixi)

14:53.084 --> 14:54.209
Who asked you to open fire?

14:54.959 --> 14:56.167
Charge!

15:07.042 --> 15:08.584
Who's running away? Stop!

15:13.917 --> 15:15.542
Bring me their heads.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.167
Charge!

15:36.042 --> 15:36.834
Don't back down!

15:40.876 --> 15:42.626
Watch out!. Fall back!

15:45.709 --> 15:47.584
Retreat!.

15:53.084 --> 15:57.667
(Hu Zongxian Residence)

16:04.959 --> 16:06.292
Count them carefully.

16:10.376 --> 16:11.542
Commander.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.251
Jiguang,

16:17.292 --> 16:18.251
come here.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.292
You deploy the troops,

16:22.459 --> 16:25.334
I deploy the money.

16:25.876 --> 16:28.501
Zhejiang is short of supplies right now.

16:30.126 --> 16:30.876
Have a seat.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.667
At the battle of Yanmen Ridge,

16:45.001 --> 16:46.876
we outnumbered the pirates,

16:47.042 --> 16:48.792
but we only managed a tie.

16:49.084 --> 16:50.876
We dared not report a victory.

16:51.584 --> 16:53.417
Never violate the rules of life to suit the time.

16:54.209 --> 16:56.584
Never commit deception to attain fame.

16:58.459 --> 17:02.042
It is easier said than done.

17:03.876 --> 17:05.959
I, for one, cannot do it.

17:10.251 --> 17:11.541
Do you know

17:12.001 --> 17:15.334
all eyes are on us right now?

17:16.459 --> 17:19.751
We can't afford to lose.

17:20.291 --> 17:23.084
A defeat would shake
the Imperial Court to its core.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.666
This is a battle

17:25.291 --> 17:26.459
you must win.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.001
The three arrows you shot

17:33.584 --> 17:35.251
became a legend in the army.

17:36.292 --> 17:39.459
Everyone hopes to fight under your command.

17:40.084 --> 17:42.042
They feel safe.

17:42.792 --> 17:45.251
But this is also our handicap!.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.251
Commander,

17:46.542 --> 17:48.709
soldiers should not expect to be safe!

17:50.626 --> 17:53.376
Please allow me to train a new army.

17:53.417 --> 17:54.917
I need your approval.

18:09.209 --> 18:11.334
Fighting the pirates is your top priority.

18:11.584 --> 18:13.417
You have no time to train soldiers.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.251
Concentrate on taking out the enemies.

18:15.292 --> 18:17.417
The sight of pirates make them flee!

18:18.001 --> 18:19.876
The battle is lost before it's begun.

18:20.042 --> 18:21.667
How can we fight like that?

18:21.709 --> 18:24.751
They can change with you in command.

18:25.292 --> 18:28.459
This is why I brought you from Shandong.

18:28.834 --> 18:31.626
I need you to wipe out the pirates.

18:32.001 --> 18:36.209
I can kill pirates
and train soldiers at the same time.

18:36.709 --> 18:39.417
Train soldiers...

18:39.834 --> 18:41.376
Zhejiang soldiers are scared of pirates.

18:42.001 --> 18:44.959
That's a fact. What more can you do?

18:45.084 --> 18:45.959
Commander,

18:46.376 --> 18:47.917
you can find someone faithful even
in a town with 10 houses.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.959
There must be someone courageous in Zhejiang.

18:50.209 --> 18:52.292
If I'm in charge of the training,

18:52.626 --> 18:56.167
you can save the money used to hire Guest Troops.

19:05.542 --> 19:06.542
Very well!.

19:08.709 --> 19:09.667
Very well!.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.667
Very well, Jiguang.

19:13.084 --> 19:16.417
If you take the trouble to train a new army,

19:16.501 --> 19:18.417
I must show my support.

19:18.792 --> 19:21.334
About the battle of Yanmen Ridge,

19:21.709 --> 19:23.209
we must report the extraordinary feat

19:24.667 --> 19:27.626
of wiping out the pirates.

19:36.584 --> 19:40.542
Go!.

19:50.126 --> 19:50.792
Jiguang!.

19:51.001 --> 19:52.417
We have been doing this for days.

19:52.542 --> 19:53.959
When are we going to fight?

19:54.126 --> 19:55.542
You have a better plan?

19:55.917 --> 19:58.001
What plan? Just charge ahead!.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.959
The General comes here every day

20:00.417 --> 20:02.542
trying to think of a plan.

20:03.209 --> 20:04.167
We don't attack or fight,

20:04.459 --> 20:06.084
because we want the enemy to let their guard down.

20:06.792 --> 20:09.667
Lou Nan, you can always read my mind.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.126
It's scary.

20:11.876 --> 20:12.876
Let's go back.

20:15.709 --> 20:18.376
The Ming Army did not launch an attack.

20:19.084 --> 20:22.209
Are they afraid to fight?

20:24.334 --> 20:27.917
He made a name for himself before he turned 30.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.501
Don't lower your guard.

20:32.501 --> 20:34.334
This man is a genius.

20:35.376 --> 20:37.459
Let's return to camp and take down the banners.

20:37.542 --> 20:38.417
Yes, sir!.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.126
General!

20:52.376 --> 20:53.334
It's raining.

20:55.917 --> 20:56.459
Jiguang,

20:56.667 --> 20:58.251
everything is ready.

20:58.376 --> 20:59.209
Shouldn't we launch

20:59.251 --> 21:01.417
the attack in the rain?

21:02.917 --> 21:04.167
In the rain?

21:04.292 --> 21:04.959
Yes!.

21:07.876 --> 21:09.001
If you can think of it,

21:09.084 --> 21:10.459
so can the pirates.

21:11.376 --> 21:12.376
Go get some rest.

21:14.334 --> 21:17.876
You should return to camp.

21:22.042 --> 21:23.959
Alright... I'll get some rest.

21:26.292 --> 21:28.001
Your brother is known
to take his enemies by surprise.

21:28.709 --> 21:29.542
Let's wait.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.292
Listen up...

21:34.834 --> 21:36.126
get some rest!.

21:42.709 --> 21:47.667
Beware of an attack in the rain at night.

21:48.209 --> 21:50.042
Be vigilant!

21:51.834 --> 21:54.542
Did you hear me?

21:58.209 --> 21:59.542
What a pain!

22:00.542 --> 22:01.917
Very well!.

22:02.584 --> 22:04.292
What are you afraid of?

22:25.709 --> 22:26.542
Here...

22:28.292 --> 22:30.542
Relax. I didn't lay a hand on her.

22:35.959 --> 22:37.209
I'm a samurai,

22:38.292 --> 22:39.751
unlike some of you.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.542
Drink up, Kohata!

23:05.501 --> 23:06.667
They're asleep.

23:08.917 --> 23:09.917
Excellent.

23:11.709 --> 23:14.501
Tell General Yu to meet me in the mountain

23:14.542 --> 23:16.084
when he hears the cannon.

23:16.542 --> 23:18.334
Wake up the troops, we're moving out.

23:20.251 --> 23:21.209
Keep it down.

23:43.542 --> 23:44.292
What's going on?

23:45.042 --> 23:45.959
Pull...

23:53.667 --> 23:55.917
A raid! We're being attacked!.

23:58.501 --> 24:00.167
Charge!

24:02.959 --> 24:04.042
We're in trouble!

24:04.334 --> 24:05.167
Run!.

24:07.876 --> 24:09.751
Charge!

24:19.167 --> 24:20.209
Follow me!.

24:20.251 --> 24:20.709
I'm not going!

24:42.792 --> 24:43.834
After them!

24:45.834 --> 24:47.376
Unit 1, charge!

24:48.042 --> 24:49.167
Let's move out!

24:49.542 --> 24:50.417
Sir,

24:51.001 --> 24:53.459
the Ming Army broke through our line of defense.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.917
Already?

24:55.542 --> 24:58.126
That general is formidable indeed.

24:58.376 --> 24:59.209
Sensei,

24:59.584 --> 25:01.209
let's go give them a hand.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.042
They're at the front gate.
We can't hold them back.

25:06.334 --> 25:08.709
We can't let them beat us.

25:09.834 --> 25:15.251
The Ming Dynasty is like an elephant;
you can't take it head on.

25:15.417 --> 25:18.334
I want a win, not a tie.

25:18.376 --> 25:21.001
Not a win at the expense of casualties.

25:24.417 --> 25:25.584
We should retreat.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.834
Are you sure?

25:28.459 --> 25:30.001
Who's willing to bring up the rear?

25:30.584 --> 25:32.792
Me, of course!.

25:33.584 --> 25:34.626
Thank you.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.292
Yes!.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.001
Let's pack up and go!

25:37.126 --> 25:37.834
Yes, sir!.

25:37.959 --> 25:38.626
Go!.

25:39.084 --> 25:40.001
Retreat!.

25:40.459 --> 25:41.917
Come on!

25:46.209 --> 25:47.042
Master Yamagawa,

25:48.209 --> 25:49.792
can you give me a hand?

25:50.292 --> 25:51.334
My pleasure.

25:58.001 --> 26:00.959
Retreat!.

26:01.126 --> 26:02.292
This way!.

26:04.251 --> 26:05.209
You must leave.

26:05.876 --> 26:08.459
We must go even if you don't want to.

26:40.042 --> 26:40.917
General Yu!.

26:41.084 --> 26:41.917
Please come in.

26:42.709 --> 26:43.751
Impressive!

26:44.959 --> 26:45.626
Very impressive!.

26:50.251 --> 26:51.042
Lou Nan!

26:51.459 --> 26:51.917
General!

26:51.959 --> 26:52.792
What is it?

26:52.876 --> 26:53.876
The pirates are gone.

26:54.542 --> 26:55.584
They left behind scraps of silver.

26:56.334 --> 26:58.001
The soldiers are busy picking them up.

27:01.126 --> 27:02.709
Jiguang, this villager wants to see you.

27:03.126 --> 27:05.001
General...

27:05.167 --> 27:06.334
Please get up!.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.292
Other villagers are still locked up.

27:09.376 --> 27:11.542
Please rescue them quickly, General.

27:11.584 --> 27:12.542
Take me there!

27:16.209 --> 27:16.792
Over here!.

27:21.584 --> 27:22.167
Jiguang!.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.542
General Qi is here to save us.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.167
Come out, all of you!.

27:25.209 --> 27:26.751
General Qi is here to save us.

27:26.792 --> 27:27.834
Come out!

27:28.709 --> 27:30.167
Thank you, General Qi!

27:32.126 --> 27:33.667
Please get up.

27:39.584 --> 27:40.376
Grab Qi!

28:16.459 --> 28:17.584
Die!

28:35.001 --> 28:35.709
Let's go!.

28:36.542 --> 28:37.292
Let's go!.

28:47.001 --> 28:47.584
Get down!

28:48.084 --> 28:49.167
Ready!.

28:50.626 --> 28:52.042
Fire!.

29:05.001 --> 29:05.876
Jiguang!.

29:07.751 --> 29:09.167
Get them out! Hurry!.

29:09.751 --> 29:10.542
Jiguang!.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.542
Help them...

29:17.751 --> 29:19.084
Jiguang!.

29:24.459 --> 29:25.834
Are you alright?

29:25.876 --> 29:26.792
I'm fine.

29:27.042 --> 29:27.834
Help them...

29:28.542 --> 29:29.167
Help them...

29:30.667 --> 29:31.626
Among the pirates,

29:32.751 --> 29:34.626
the majority of them were
Han Chinese dispossessed by the sea ban

29:35.251 --> 29:37.001
and sought refuge with Wang Zhi.

29:38.376 --> 29:40.709
You're saying they are not Japanese?

29:41.084 --> 29:42.126
They include Japanese ronins.

29:43.292 --> 29:44.542
But those with genuine combat prowess

29:44.876 --> 29:48.376
are well equipped Japanese soldiers.

29:48.917 --> 29:49.917
Japanese soldiers?

29:51.251 --> 29:52.667
That's who we're dealing with.

29:53.001 --> 29:53.667
They're rare.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.001
General, Commander Hu is here.

29:56.417 --> 29:57.334
Again?

30:00.084 --> 30:01.334
Congratulations.

30:01.917 --> 30:03.792
Commander Hu brought the best yellow wine

30:04.042 --> 30:05.251
to celebrate.

30:05.709 --> 30:08.126
Why did you bring the
Imperial Secret Service with you?

30:11.042 --> 30:14.667
Luo Jiabin and his lot intend to impeach you

30:15.667 --> 30:17.042
for letting the pirates get away.

30:17.584 --> 30:18.834
They said you colluded with them.

30:19.542 --> 30:20.584
I did not!

30:22.917 --> 30:24.501
I know.

30:25.584 --> 30:28.126
I already reported your victory.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.834
But before my report reaches the court,

30:33.167 --> 30:34.626
you are to stay home

30:35.501 --> 30:36.584
pending your sentence.

30:42.126 --> 30:43.126
General Yu,

30:43.959 --> 30:44.917
I'm sorry.

30:47.834 --> 30:48.751
No problem.

30:56.334 --> 30:57.917
I will do my best to intercede.

30:59.251 --> 31:00.459
Don't just arrest General Yu.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.001
Put me under arrest as well.

31:05.209 --> 31:06.251
I have my orders.

31:06.709 --> 31:08.167
General Yu failed his expedition

31:08.584 --> 31:09.792
and allowed the pirates to flee to the South.

31:10.084 --> 31:11.876
The Imperial Secret Service
will take him into custody.

31:14.209 --> 31:15.917
Pardon us, General. This way.

31:15.959 --> 31:16.834
I understand.

31:17.167 --> 31:17.876
General Yu...

31:20.501 --> 31:21.251
I'll be fine.

31:33.542 --> 31:35.792
It wasn't my decision to make.

31:56.292 --> 31:58.167
This is so unfair.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.042
You should quit.

32:01.709 --> 32:03.334
Tiny house, small salary...

32:03.376 --> 32:04.584
Who cares?

32:05.667 --> 32:08.167
Hu Zongxian is notorious.

32:08.542 --> 32:09.917
Working for him,

32:10.209 --> 32:12.834
win or lose, you're doomed.

32:15.876 --> 32:17.209
This is just my humble opinion.

32:17.542 --> 32:18.876
Whether or not you want to listen

32:19.834 --> 32:20.834
is up to you.

32:32.751 --> 32:35.126
You make perfect sense.

32:36.292 --> 32:38.084
But the enemy is at the gate;

32:38.667 --> 32:39.959
I can't just walk away.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.042
It's a state matter;

32:43.251 --> 32:45.084
you can't do this alone.

32:53.459 --> 32:55.167
I thought you were depressed.

32:55.501 --> 32:57.084
Why this lively behavior?

32:57.792 --> 32:59.251
What do you mean?

33:01.001 --> 33:02.751
Sex between married people

33:04.167 --> 33:06.209
is the most natural and proper thing to do.

33:08.167 --> 33:09.876
Don't throw the book in my face again.

33:10.251 --> 33:11.417
I wouldn't dare.

33:14.084 --> 33:15.542
Of course you would.

33:16.001 --> 33:17.709
You're invincible.

33:21.209 --> 33:23.584
You're the invincible one.

33:58.334 --> 33:59.876
Our shields are not tough enough.

34:01.001 --> 34:02.042
We'll think of something.

34:13.001 --> 34:15.417
This is Mao Haifeng's sword.

34:16.751 --> 34:17.458
Here...

34:17.708 --> 34:19.292
You can use this.

34:22.458 --> 34:23.458
Absolutely not!

34:24.333 --> 34:27.292
A Ming general using a Japanese sword

34:27.417 --> 34:29.126
is bad for morale.

34:29.833 --> 34:32.083
No doubt this is a good sword.

34:32.417 --> 34:35.167
I'm surprised it's such a trenchant sword.

34:35.583 --> 34:38.167
I think it's made differently from ours.

34:39.042 --> 34:39.792
Jimei,

34:39.876 --> 34:40.708
study it carefully

34:40.917 --> 34:42.667
and find out how it's forged.

34:42.876 --> 34:43.501
I will!

34:45.292 --> 34:45.958
General!

34:46.417 --> 34:47.126
General Qi!

34:47.458 --> 34:48.917
Commander Hu just received court documents

34:49.083 --> 34:50.917
about your victory at Cengang.

34:51.001 --> 34:51.917
You have been reinstated.

34:54.208 --> 34:54.751
Good!

34:54.876 --> 34:56.292
What about General Yu?

34:57.251 --> 34:59.042
There has been no word.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.084
Come.

35:16.501 --> 35:17.334
General Yu!

35:17.876 --> 35:18.501
General Yu!

35:18.542 --> 35:20.001
General Qi! General Lu!.

35:20.167 --> 35:21.209
I'm glad you're here.

35:21.667 --> 35:23.042
This is General Qi Jiguang,

35:23.251 --> 35:25.751
who commanded the decisive victory at Cengang.

35:25.792 --> 35:27.126
We have heard so much about you.

35:28.584 --> 35:29.667
Enjoy.

35:30.584 --> 35:32.292
You have been reinstated.

35:33.334 --> 35:34.584
What are you worried about?

35:36.542 --> 35:37.417
I didn't expect

35:37.459 --> 35:40.292
you'd be so relaxed in jail.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.001
Over the years,

35:42.126 --> 35:45.417
do you know how many men we've lost in battle?

35:46.917 --> 35:49.084
I'm just waiting for my sentence.

35:50.084 --> 35:52.542
I can still practice with my men.

35:53.709 --> 35:54.876
What's there to complain about?

35:55.542 --> 35:57.334
You have fought the pirates for years

35:57.501 --> 35:58.501
and earned great merit.

35:58.626 --> 36:00.292
Don't you feel aggrieved?

36:02.292 --> 36:03.584
Yes, I fought pirates for years.

36:04.209 --> 36:05.501
Have they been wiped out?

36:07.251 --> 36:08.167
I feel ashamed.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.501
I have no right to feel aggrieved.

36:12.084 --> 36:13.876
We shed our blood on the frontline

36:14.042 --> 36:16.792
while those idiot officials
badmouth us behind our backs

36:16.959 --> 36:18.667
and try to pin the blame on you.

36:19.334 --> 36:21.167
You don't find that unsettling?

36:21.251 --> 36:22.792
You mean Commander Hu?

36:25.084 --> 36:27.459
It hasn't been easy for him.

36:27.876 --> 36:30.584
Commander Hu and Xu Wei

36:31.167 --> 36:33.542
did their best to cover for me.

36:34.459 --> 36:38.626
Else I would have been beheaded like Zhang Jing.

36:39.376 --> 36:43.126
Hu Zongxian colluded
with Yan Song's godson, Zhao Wenhua,

36:43.584 --> 36:45.001
and did their bidding.

36:45.709 --> 36:47.292
He replaced Commander Zhang Jing

36:47.417 --> 36:48.626
and had him executed.

36:48.917 --> 36:50.001
None of that is true?

36:51.459 --> 36:54.126
If Commander Hu didn't kiss up to Zhao Wenhua,

36:54.626 --> 36:56.084
you and I would probably be dead by now.

36:57.251 --> 36:58.501
Where do you think the army provisions came from?

36:59.084 --> 37:00.584
We'd never get the chance to fight pirates.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.251
He bargained for a thankless job

37:02.626 --> 37:06.251
that could have him beheaded even if he had won.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.126
Why does he bother?

37:11.251 --> 37:14.751
Commander Hu saved my life.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.167
I have no complaints.

37:18.501 --> 37:19.792
As a martial artist,

37:20.626 --> 37:22.334
I'm satisfied as long as
I have a clear conscience.

37:25.626 --> 37:27.417
I'm also pleased

37:27.876 --> 37:28.667
that you will now take over this burden.

37:28.834 --> 37:30.167
Here... have a drink with me.

37:43.542 --> 37:46.084
Commander Hu will get me out.

37:48.251 --> 37:49.042
Brother Yu,

37:49.376 --> 37:51.626
can I ask you something?

37:51.667 --> 37:52.376
What?

37:52.501 --> 37:54.042
I was told your skill with the staff

37:54.376 --> 37:56.334
is outstanding in Shaolin
and unmatched in the world.

37:56.751 --> 37:57.792
I had a glimpse of it

37:58.251 --> 37:59.751
last time in Cengang;

37:59.917 --> 38:02.126
I'd like to take another look.

38:02.167 --> 38:03.209
Very well!

38:11.417 --> 38:13.626
An inch longer, an inch stronger.

38:16.751 --> 38:19.209
An inch shorter, an inch deadlier.

39:00.376 --> 39:01.334
Again!

40:05.709 --> 40:07.542
General Qi! General Lu!.

40:07.751 --> 40:08.584
General Qi!

40:10.584 --> 40:11.834
General Lu!. General Qi!.

40:12.584 --> 40:13.584
Stay where you are.

40:13.834 --> 40:15.459
I heard you were going on an inspection tour.

40:15.626 --> 40:17.417
Commander Hu sent me to assist you.

40:17.584 --> 40:18.751
I have so much to learn from you.

40:18.792 --> 40:19.876
So much indeed.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.042
Learn from us? You're here to spy on us.

40:22.292 --> 40:22.959
No...

40:23.084 --> 40:24.667
Because I can read and write,

40:24.876 --> 40:26.834
Commander Hu wanted me to assist General Qi.

40:30.834 --> 40:31.626
Thank you.

40:31.917 --> 40:32.834
Let's go!

40:33.084 --> 40:34.417
Sit tight, General.

40:37.251 --> 40:38.834
We can go now.

40:41.667 --> 40:42.376
Sister!

40:50.792 --> 40:51.542
Right.

40:54.001 --> 40:54.667
Wait up...

40:55.417 --> 40:56.001
Wait up!

40:56.792 --> 40:57.584
Hey...

40:58.001 --> 40:58.917
What's wrong?

41:00.459 --> 41:01.376
What's wrong?

41:01.959 --> 41:03.667
You'll be gone for several days.

41:03.751 --> 41:05.292
Naturally you don't want to bring me along.

41:05.542 --> 41:06.459
Says who?

41:06.501 --> 41:07.501
Who says I'm not bringing you?

41:07.542 --> 41:08.167
Then where's my horse?

41:08.334 --> 41:09.126
We're getting it ready.

41:09.251 --> 41:09.959
Getting it ready?

41:13.792 --> 41:15.584
What's your hurry?

41:16.042 --> 41:18.501
Why would I leave you behind?

41:20.751 --> 41:21.792
You think I'd want that?

41:27.792 --> 41:28.792
Hurry...

41:30.792 --> 41:31.709
The horse is ready.

41:35.917 --> 41:36.459
Jiguang!

41:36.876 --> 41:37.834
Morning, Madam Qi!

41:39.834 --> 41:40.751
Morning, General Lu.

41:41.334 --> 41:43.709
General Qi just told me

41:44.209 --> 41:46.292
we're waiting for you.

41:47.251 --> 41:48.709
Sorry to keep you waiting.

41:55.251 --> 41:56.042
Allow me...

42:28.334 --> 42:29.709
Hey, pretty lady!

42:32.584 --> 42:34.251
You guys, stop acting like this...

42:49.626 --> 42:51.209
Sorry!

42:52.959 --> 42:54.709
You're drunk!

42:55.417 --> 42:56.542
Let's see...

42:56.584 --> 42:59.084
No, watch me!

43:03.042 --> 43:05.334
You're drunk, pal.

43:07.584 --> 43:08.584
Listen up...

43:08.876 --> 43:10.417
We are Qi Jiguang's troops.

43:10.792 --> 43:12.001
We specialize in killing pirates.

43:13.292 --> 43:15.584
I think you're a pirate.

43:16.459 --> 43:17.292
Brothers...

43:17.667 --> 43:18.917
take them into custody!

43:36.001 --> 43:36.792
Brother...

43:36.834 --> 43:37.667
General!

43:37.709 --> 43:39.626
That's him. He beat us up.

43:39.667 --> 43:42.042
Shut up! Are you blind?

43:44.417 --> 43:45.417
General,

43:46.709 --> 43:48.126
they're your troops.

43:48.667 --> 43:49.917
They can't be!.

43:59.292 --> 44:00.792
Come on...

44:05.917 --> 44:06.792
Thank you...

44:06.959 --> 44:08.209
Impressive, General!

44:08.292 --> 44:09.376
Thank you...

44:09.917 --> 44:11.209
Anyone else?

44:11.376 --> 44:12.459
Let me do it again.

44:13.542 --> 44:14.251
Forget it!

44:16.292 --> 44:17.209
Madam Qi?

44:17.501 --> 44:20.042
Come on...

44:20.834 --> 44:21.959
Go for it, Madam Qi...

44:24.417 --> 44:25.626
Harder...

44:50.334 --> 44:51.709
What is that?

44:55.876 --> 44:56.667
Excuse me...

44:57.334 --> 44:58.709
what is this for?

44:59.042 --> 45:00.459
Put your feet inside,

45:00.667 --> 45:01.584
and hold the handle like this.

45:01.709 --> 45:02.876
What is it called?

45:03.251 --> 45:05.001
A mud horse.

45:05.251 --> 45:07.709
You can walk in the mud.

45:08.376 --> 45:09.292
Mud horse?

45:09.376 --> 45:10.334
Very interesting.

45:10.376 --> 45:12.501
Give it a try. It's a lot fun.

45:30.584 --> 45:32.126
Why are these people fighting?

45:32.459 --> 45:33.292
Exactly.

45:35.876 --> 45:36.917
The magistrate is over there.

45:38.042 --> 45:40.292
You're such a coward...

45:40.751 --> 45:41.751
Why doesn't he stop them?

45:44.501 --> 45:48.042
Generals, I'm Zhao Dahe,
the county magistrate of Yiwu.

45:48.459 --> 45:51.251
Why are these people fighting?

45:51.501 --> 45:52.751
You don't understand.

45:53.084 --> 45:54.792
Yiwu has always been poor and barren.

45:55.084 --> 45:57.626
But the folks have discovered a gold mine lately

45:57.959 --> 45:59.542
along with other metal ores.

45:59.709 --> 46:01.417
People started calling this area Treasure Hill.

46:01.834 --> 46:04.917
Villagers from Yongkang came to mine the ores

46:05.126 --> 46:07.084
and the parties started to fight.

46:07.542 --> 46:09.167
They came several days ago

46:09.417 --> 46:11.834
and the villagers from Yiwu fought them off.

46:12.126 --> 46:14.209
But they keep coming back.

46:45.709 --> 46:46.709
Commander!.

47:01.167 --> 47:01.917
Commander!.

47:02.334 --> 47:04.542
I found men in Yiwu I can train.

47:05.417 --> 47:06.751
Just the man I was looking for.

47:12.042 --> 47:13.667
Take a look at this!.

47:18.584 --> 47:20.376
It says here that I kissed up to Zhao Wenhua,

47:20.876 --> 47:23.542
replaced Zhang Jing through political trickery,

47:24.376 --> 47:26.959
and eventually devised a plan to murder him.

47:28.209 --> 47:30.042
Did you say that?

47:37.709 --> 47:42.042
If I didn't pay off the Imperial Secret Service,

47:44.167 --> 47:46.501
and they managed to report this to Zhen Wenhua,

47:47.459 --> 47:50.417
you'd suffer the same fate as Zhang Jing.

48:04.459 --> 48:05.792
No doubt I was after his position,

48:06.959 --> 48:09.001
but killing Zhang Jing

48:09.834 --> 48:10.959
was not my idea.

48:13.876 --> 48:16.959
They say I was treacherous

48:17.876 --> 48:19.917
and convinced Wang Zhi to surrender.

48:22.251 --> 48:24.251
That was not my idea either.

48:34.834 --> 48:36.917
Don't you think I want to be

48:38.084 --> 48:40.667
a man of his word?

48:44.834 --> 48:47.417
If only the situation was under my control,

48:47.626 --> 48:50.626
the pirates problem would be resolved
without going to war!

49:06.417 --> 49:08.167
Jiguang,

49:10.751 --> 49:12.376
the walls have ears.

49:13.334 --> 49:14.584
With regards to the Imperial Court,

49:14.709 --> 49:17.334
it's best you keep your opinions to yourself!

49:20.459 --> 49:22.542
You're a genius in commanding
and training your troops,

49:23.459 --> 49:24.709
but when it comes to politics,

49:26.042 --> 49:28.126
you have so much to learn.

49:31.834 --> 49:33.417
You want a new army?

49:37.042 --> 49:38.292
This money

49:40.042 --> 49:43.334
was supposed to buy you a promotion.

49:45.001 --> 49:48.292
But I guess you'd rather use it

49:48.876 --> 49:50.876
to train soldiers in Yiwu.

49:55.959 --> 49:56.751
Very well!

49:58.501 --> 49:59.334
I'll leave the army

50:00.417 --> 50:01.626
in your capable hands.

50:15.542 --> 50:16.417
Thank you, sir!

50:57.667 --> 51:00.209
Listen to me, folks.

51:00.376 --> 51:03.459
We're recruiting soldiers to fight pirates.

51:04.001 --> 51:04.959
I don't know.

51:05.042 --> 51:06.542
You go, I go.

51:06.834 --> 51:08.001
Let me read this for you.

51:08.209 --> 51:09.959
With strong arms...

51:12.626 --> 51:13.417
Liar!.

51:14.709 --> 51:16.334
Liar!.

51:18.459 --> 51:19.501
Zhao Dahe,

51:20.251 --> 51:22.084
how much did Yongkang village pay you

51:22.709 --> 51:24.126
to con us into joining the army

51:24.667 --> 51:26.126
so they can steal our mines?

51:26.459 --> 51:27.209
Watch your mouth!.

51:27.376 --> 51:29.167
Whoever leaves Yiwu to join the army

51:29.834 --> 51:31.126
is my enemy.

51:32.709 --> 51:33.626
Hear that?

51:34.084 --> 51:34.876
No one is leaving.

51:39.042 --> 51:41.709
Listen to me...

51:57.126 --> 51:58.542
Relax!

51:58.667 --> 52:01.459
We came to see Dacheng.

52:03.792 --> 52:04.834
This way...

52:05.542 --> 52:07.542
Dacheng...

52:08.334 --> 52:10.876
General Qi wants a word with you.

52:11.292 --> 52:12.126
Please

52:12.751 --> 52:13.584
Go away!.

52:14.459 --> 52:15.542
Leave me alone!.

52:16.417 --> 52:18.167
Going to war is your business.

52:19.292 --> 52:21.542
Fighting pirates is everyone's business.

52:22.709 --> 52:23.501
Dacheng,

52:23.876 --> 52:25.292
no one wants to go to war.

52:25.501 --> 52:27.876
In the face of an invasion,

52:28.001 --> 52:29.917
we must fight to protect our homes.

52:30.042 --> 52:31.501
You must know that.

52:32.042 --> 52:32.792
Damn!

52:33.459 --> 52:34.584
When they came to rob us,

52:34.667 --> 52:35.459
where were you?

52:38.001 --> 52:40.042
Don't butt in, this is man talk.

52:40.709 --> 52:41.376
More water.

52:45.876 --> 52:46.709
She's right.

52:47.501 --> 52:49.459
Where were you when they robbed us?

52:53.167 --> 52:54.417
As a soldier,

52:55.292 --> 52:56.376
why didn't you protect us?

52:56.792 --> 52:58.126
We were busy fighting pirates.

52:58.834 --> 53:02.209
Else villagers from Yongkang won't be robbing you.

53:02.459 --> 53:03.667
It would be the pirates.

53:04.334 --> 53:05.626
Can you fight them off?

53:08.709 --> 53:11.542
If you follow me,

53:12.084 --> 53:14.792
I'll send the army to protect your mines.

53:16.376 --> 53:17.584
You're funny!

53:18.167 --> 53:19.542
You already have an army.

53:19.959 --> 53:21.001
What do you want with us?

53:22.126 --> 53:23.834
Because you are good men.

53:25.251 --> 53:27.626
You're such a smooth talker.

53:28.542 --> 53:29.709
Are you even a man?

53:29.751 --> 53:31.459
You're being unreasonable! You must not be a man!.

53:50.209 --> 53:51.084
Dacheng,

53:53.126 --> 53:55.709
what will it take for you to say yes?

54:03.251 --> 54:04.209
Your fists.

54:06.667 --> 54:08.084
That's all I know.

54:09.751 --> 54:10.751
I'm happy to oblige.

54:27.376 --> 54:28.542
How do you like my fists?

54:37.251 --> 54:38.417
How is your hand?

55:29.126 --> 55:29.959
Thank you, I won.

55:31.042 --> 55:31.792
Says who?

55:32.042 --> 55:33.042
I have not lost yet!

56:10.626 --> 56:11.501
Keep running!

56:27.959 --> 56:29.709
Give me a hand!.

56:40.959 --> 56:42.584
No need to walk us out.

56:43.126 --> 56:45.084
I'll bring them to you in a few days.

56:45.376 --> 56:46.209
Great!

56:47.084 --> 56:49.334
You must keep your word.

56:49.584 --> 56:50.417
Of course.

56:50.667 --> 56:52.584
If anyone tries to steal your mines,

56:52.792 --> 56:54.667
I'll be the first to protect them.

56:55.334 --> 56:57.542
Don't worry, Dacheng.

56:57.834 --> 57:00.209
General Qi is a man of his word.

57:02.292 --> 57:03.001
General Qi,

57:03.417 --> 57:04.459
you're so brilliant.

57:04.834 --> 57:08.709
This is a win-win solution.

57:10.459 --> 57:11.667
You should come with us.

57:12.501 --> 57:13.751
We're going onto the battlefield;

57:13.959 --> 57:15.792
you shouldn't be here doing a cushy job.

57:15.834 --> 57:17.626
That's right. You must come with us.

57:18.626 --> 57:21.042
I'm a scholar.

57:21.417 --> 57:23.376
I have no business

57:23.459 --> 57:25.209
fighting on the battlefield.

57:25.334 --> 57:27.251
Fighting pirates is everyone's business.

57:27.417 --> 57:28.209
You said that yourself.

57:28.501 --> 57:29.334
Are you coming or not?

57:33.209 --> 57:34.042
Magistrate,

57:34.251 --> 57:36.501
nobody knows Yiwu better than you.

57:36.834 --> 57:39.126
You're best suited

57:39.292 --> 57:40.667
to be the army prefect.

57:46.084 --> 57:47.084
Great.

57:48.334 --> 57:51.084
If you're willing to follow General Qi,

57:51.709 --> 57:55.042
I, Zhao Dahe,

57:55.084 --> 57:56.501
am willing to risk my life

57:57.001 --> 57:57.917
and go wherever you go!

57:58.042 --> 57:58.709
Good!

58:07.251 --> 58:09.167
Let me explain the map to you.

58:09.209 --> 58:11.042
I came to see your new army.

58:11.084 --> 58:12.917
This is your home, Yiwu.

58:13.209 --> 58:14.584
We're in Xinhe.

58:14.834 --> 58:16.501
Why is Yiwu so small?

58:17.001 --> 58:18.167
It's only a map.

58:19.042 --> 58:20.084
Be careful...

58:21.792 --> 58:23.126
Look!

58:24.251 --> 58:26.084
This bamboo spear is called Wolf Brush.

58:27.167 --> 58:28.167
You don't understand?

58:28.501 --> 58:29.334
Pass me that...

58:31.126 --> 58:32.376
When you use this,

58:32.751 --> 58:34.001
insert the branches and leaves.

58:36.001 --> 58:37.042
Look again.

58:37.084 --> 58:38.251
Looks weird, right?

58:48.751 --> 58:49.626
Stop!

58:51.167 --> 58:51.959
Let's wait!

58:52.084 --> 58:53.626
Take a break on the spot.

59:00.042 --> 59:01.876
Why do we have to run?

59:02.459 --> 59:04.417
You need strength.

59:04.667 --> 59:05.459
How else can you fight?

59:05.626 --> 59:07.126
I have never been this tired before.

59:09.834 --> 59:10.834
General Lou,

59:11.834 --> 59:13.709
I've been practicing with you.

59:14.042 --> 59:15.751
Can I have an army uniform?

59:17.084 --> 59:19.209
Don't forget

59:19.667 --> 59:21.251
you work for Commander Hu.

59:21.459 --> 59:23.126
We wouldn't dare give it to you.

59:26.501 --> 59:27.042
Can you manage?

59:27.251 --> 59:28.126
Yes.

59:29.459 --> 59:30.042
Carry on!.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.167
If you won't give up,

59:31.251 --> 59:32.334
we won't give up on you.

59:32.417 --> 59:33.209
Good!

59:33.709 --> 59:35.001
Carry on!.

59:35.126 --> 59:36.251
Carry on!.

59:36.292 --> 59:37.751
If we stand united,

59:37.834 --> 59:39.667
we can bring down the mountains.

59:39.834 --> 59:41.292
If we are loyal and patriotic,

59:41.459 --> 59:43.042
we can beat all obstacles.

59:43.209 --> 59:44.667
The General cares about us

59:44.917 --> 59:46.667
like we're family.

59:46.709 --> 59:48.167
If we break the rules,

59:48.417 --> 59:50.084
we shall be punished.

59:50.167 --> 59:51.542
If we obey direct orders,

59:51.709 --> 59:53.084
you shall be rewarded.

59:53.126 --> 59:54.584
We go through fire and water

59:54.626 --> 59:56.334
without hesitation.

59:56.417 --> 59:57.751
We serve His Majesty

59:57.792 --> 59:59.584
and save the people.

59:59.709 --> 01:00:01.042
Kill pirates

01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:02.792
and seek titles.

01:00:09.751 --> 01:00:10.709
Raise your sabers!

01:00:12.251 --> 01:00:12.917
Back!.

01:00:53.501 --> 01:00:54.876
If we stand united,

01:00:54.959 --> 01:00:56.417
we can bring down the mountains.

01:00:56.751 --> 01:00:58.084
If we are loyal and patriotic,

01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:00.167
we can beat all obstacles.

01:01:00.292 --> 01:01:01.667
The General cares about us

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.417
like we're family.

01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:04.959
If we break the rules,

01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:06.667
we shall be punished

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:20.626
I'm home!

01:01:21.876 --> 01:01:22.626
Jiguang!

01:01:25.834 --> 01:01:26.792
I'm so sorry.

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:29.876
I was visiting with Minister Tang Shunzhi.

01:01:30.084 --> 01:01:32.084
We had a nice visit and forgot the time.

01:01:32.667 --> 01:01:34.126
This is a gift from him.

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:35.334
Jiguang,

01:01:35.584 --> 01:01:36.751
let's eat.

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:39.001
You've been waiting for me?

01:01:39.126 --> 01:01:39.917
It's quite alright.

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:41.876
We don't mind waiting.

01:01:42.417 --> 01:01:42.959
I'm sorry.

01:01:43.001 --> 01:01:43.917
Let's eat.

01:01:44.292 --> 01:01:44.667
I'll take that.

01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:46.417
Come on, let's eat.

01:01:46.876 --> 01:01:47.501
My dear,

01:01:54.167 --> 01:01:56.834
these books are Minister Tang's life's work.

01:01:58.209 --> 01:01:58.834
Come on...

01:02:00.376 --> 01:02:01.084
My dear...

01:02:03.751 --> 01:02:04.584
No!

01:02:05.334 --> 01:02:06.292
The food is cold.

01:02:06.459 --> 01:02:07.209
Xiao Mou,

01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:08.834
clear the table.

01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:11.126
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

01:02:11.584 --> 01:02:12.751
Please eat out.

01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:22.167
My dear...

01:02:23.126 --> 01:02:24.917
I'm just a little late for dinner.

01:02:25.667 --> 01:02:27.376
There's no need to make such a fuss.

01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:29.959
Did I?

01:02:32.834 --> 01:02:34.334
We were supposed to host the dinner together.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.084
We must not be rude.

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:43.959
Are you picking a fight?

01:02:49.751 --> 01:02:50.501
Stop it!

01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:10.501
We should go.

01:03:10.626 --> 01:03:12.626
It's his fault.

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:15.626
I better leave.

01:03:23.001 --> 01:03:24.126
Listen to me,

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.959
from now on, General Qi's business

01:03:26.542 --> 01:03:27.876
is our business.

01:03:28.209 --> 01:03:29.042
Women!

01:03:29.834 --> 01:03:31.251
You must put her in her place.

01:03:31.751 --> 01:03:34.292
Let her know who's in charge.

01:03:35.084 --> 01:03:36.001
You must tell her.

01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:37.167
Be tough.

01:03:37.334 --> 01:03:38.584
Don't take it anymore.

01:03:39.376 --> 01:03:40.417
Even a tiger

01:03:41.126 --> 01:03:42.667
will fall asleep.

01:03:43.751 --> 01:03:44.917
When she's asleep,

01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:47.709
put a knife to her neck.

01:03:48.251 --> 01:03:49.959
Wake her up and tell her

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:52.751
if she refuses to obey,

01:03:54.209 --> 01:03:56.167
you'll kill her.

01:03:56.334 --> 01:03:57.376
You must subjugate her.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:03:58.251
Yes!.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:01.251
Hear, hear! Dacheng is right!.

01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:02.584
That's what we should do.

01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:45.501
My dear...

01:04:48.126 --> 01:04:49.334
What are you doing with the sword?

01:04:57.459 --> 01:05:01.251
I want to kill a chicken for you as a tonic.

01:05:16.001 --> 01:05:19.209
Your sword should not be used to kill a chicken.

01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:36.751
Dacheng,

01:05:38.376 --> 01:05:39.709
who invited my wife?

01:05:40.126 --> 01:05:41.501
We know you couldn't do it.

01:05:41.709 --> 01:05:43.667
We decided to do it for you.

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.001
Drop the cup as our signal,

01:05:46.459 --> 01:05:48.084
we'll hold her at knife point.

01:05:48.459 --> 01:05:49.459
You don't need to say anything.

01:05:49.626 --> 01:05:50.542
We'll do the talking for you.

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:51.917
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

01:05:52.001 --> 01:05:53.417
Here she comes...

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:01.167
Jiguang,

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:03.084
what's so urgent

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.751
that I must come over right away?

01:06:09.167 --> 01:06:09.709
Madam Qi.

01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:13.292
Serve tea.

01:06:20.542 --> 01:06:21.376
Sister.

01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:25.501
What's wrong?

01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:26.917
You're all acting weird.

01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:29.667
General Qi!

01:06:31.042 --> 01:06:31.959
Your tea...

01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:04.667
What's going on?

01:07:14.626 --> 01:07:15.584
My dear,

01:07:18.042 --> 01:07:21.084
I want you to watch our training

01:07:21.501 --> 01:07:22.459
and give us some advice.

01:07:31.042 --> 01:07:32.126
I don't know anything about that.

01:07:32.834 --> 01:07:33.626
Just review the troops.

01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.209
Review the troops.

01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:40.001
Good idea!

01:07:40.959 --> 01:07:41.834
I'll go get ready.

01:07:43.251 --> 01:07:44.167
You heard him.

01:07:44.667 --> 01:07:46.167
Review the troops.

01:07:48.376 --> 01:07:49.126
Let's go.

01:07:50.126 --> 01:07:51.084
Let's go.

01:07:55.501 --> 01:07:58.292
General Qi set a good example.

01:08:00.126 --> 01:08:00.959
Wait!

01:08:01.459 --> 01:08:02.584
Don't write that down!.

01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:04.292
It's part of history.

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:07.376
What history? Tear that up!

01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:23.626
Kohata's ronins already set out for Ninghai.

01:08:26.126 --> 01:08:29.834
They have 3,134 men.

01:08:30.334 --> 01:08:32.542
Regardless of how effective Qi's troops are,

01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:35.834
there's no need for you to worry.

01:08:36.292 --> 01:08:38.834
I heard he set strict criteria for his recruits.

01:08:39.292 --> 01:08:42.251
No one from a big city
and no one that has been in office.

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:47.042
Only those who know hardwork, no cowards.

01:08:47.376 --> 01:08:50.459
Nobody too daring either.

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:52.251
Just imagine,

01:08:52.626 --> 01:08:55.251
what kind of people would he end up with?

01:08:56.876 --> 01:08:59.417
Fools!

01:09:00.251 --> 01:09:04.042
He'll end up commanding fools.

01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:10.126
At the battle of Cengang,

01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:12.834
we have the ability to defeat them.

01:09:13.209 --> 01:09:15.709
But Sensei won't let us engage them.

01:09:16.084 --> 01:09:19.417
Had we done that back then,

01:09:19.751 --> 01:09:22.709
we wouldn't have to worry about Qi today.

01:09:24.459 --> 01:09:29.292
Are you criticizing me?

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:36.126
I don't understand.

01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:39.292
We have 20,000 men.

01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:42.917
If we attack Taizhou directly,

01:09:43.542 --> 01:09:46.501
Qi will have to engage us

01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:48.876
and we can defeat him.

01:09:49.876 --> 01:09:51.584
Why split the army three ways?

01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:54.751
What's the use of attacking Ninghai
and Taizhou simultaneously?

01:09:57.334 --> 01:09:59.709
To ensure a win.

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:04.334
Sending the ronins to Ninghai

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:08.459
will make Qi's troops travel one day to fight.

01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:15.334
We take Taizhou while
they're engaged with the ronins.

01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:17.209
What about Xinhe?

01:10:17.667 --> 01:10:20.042
What's the point of attacking an empty barrack?

01:10:28.667 --> 01:10:33.709
Qi and his troops' families are in Xinhe.

01:10:35.876 --> 01:10:38.626
Between defending the land

01:10:39.876 --> 01:10:41.751
and protecting their families,

01:10:44.126 --> 01:10:46.709
how would they choose?

01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:52.792
Whatever they choose to do,

01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:58.584
it'll be a very interesting situation.

01:11:01.084 --> 01:11:04.042
We'll wait for them to take the bait.

01:11:07.084 --> 01:11:10.667
Pirates never brought more than 3,000 men.

01:11:11.251 --> 01:11:12.209
But this time,

01:11:13.126 --> 01:11:14.792
20,000 pirates

01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:16.667
landed near Fenghua.

01:11:18.292 --> 01:11:18.917
Jiguang,

01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:20.959
your new army only has 3,000 men.

01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:22.417
How can you fight them?

01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:24.251
Commander,

01:11:24.626 --> 01:11:27.459
you are sending sheep to a lion.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.167
General Lu,

01:11:29.334 --> 01:11:30.626
we're not sheep.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:31.876
Don't get in over your head.

01:11:31.959 --> 01:11:34.167
How much longer must we wait?

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:37.167
The longer we wait,

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:39.209
the longer our people will suffer.

01:11:39.917 --> 01:11:42.084
We must stop the pirates' threat.

01:11:45.459 --> 01:11:46.709
Does anyone else

01:11:47.084 --> 01:11:49.792
have any counter measures?

01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:04.459
Japanese soldiers congregated
in Ninghai but made no moves

01:12:05.167 --> 01:12:07.459
because they want you to take the bait.

01:12:08.001 --> 01:12:09.417
I'm willing to take the bait.

01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:13.292
If I don't, they won't make a move.

01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:16.376
The battle of Cengang tells us

01:12:16.626 --> 01:12:18.792
they have military strategists among them.

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:21.251
It's probably the same group.

01:12:22.751 --> 01:12:23.501
I suggest

01:12:23.834 --> 01:12:26.667
troops in Taizhou and Xiangshan should lay low

01:12:26.917 --> 01:12:28.917
to ensure that the pirates won't take
advantage of our weak defense.

01:12:29.501 --> 01:12:31.792
I'll take the lead with the new army.

01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:34.417
When we find out their real motive,

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:36.167
we'll let Commander Hu make a ruling.

01:12:36.459 --> 01:12:37.376
This time,

01:12:37.917 --> 01:12:39.792
we won't let them get away again.

01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:47.001
Jiguang,

01:12:48.584 --> 01:12:50.334
set out for Ninghai right away.

01:12:51.126 --> 01:12:52.042
General Lu,

01:12:52.667 --> 01:12:55.542
we'll take command of Taizhou.

01:12:55.917 --> 01:12:56.917
The rest of the troops

01:12:57.501 --> 01:12:59.626
will stay put and beef up the defense

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:01.001
pending our new order.

01:13:02.542 --> 01:13:03.751
Good idea, Commander!

01:13:04.334 --> 01:13:06.334
Good idea!

01:13:07.334 --> 01:13:10.167
Because you're not doing the fighting.

01:13:12.584 --> 01:13:13.792
So be it.

01:13:20.792 --> 01:13:21.876
I heard

01:13:23.167 --> 01:13:24.959
the enemy has 20,000 men.

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:28.584
Don't worry!.

01:13:29.626 --> 01:13:30.792
Thank you.

01:13:37.126 --> 01:13:38.292
20,000 men.

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:40.334
20,000 pirates.

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:42.501
Can we beat them?

01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:45.251
Last time we outnumbered them 20 to 1

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:47.209
and the war dragged on for 6 months.

01:13:47.876 --> 01:13:48.834
Just wait.

01:13:52.626 --> 01:13:54.626
Don't they know they're on a suicide mission?

01:13:55.334 --> 01:13:56.501
And they look so confident.

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:00.834
What did you say?

01:14:01.334 --> 01:14:02.501
I'd like to see you take their place.

01:14:03.876 --> 01:14:07.126
You're a bunch of cowards hanging out here!.

01:14:07.459 --> 01:14:08.501
Why don't you go to the frontline?

01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:10.042
You have no right to criticize!

01:14:12.792 --> 01:14:13.751
Chopsticks!

01:14:15.376 --> 01:14:16.834
Cowards!.

01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:21.126
Father!

01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:23.126
Slow down...

01:14:51.751 --> 01:14:52.501
We have to leave.

01:15:09.459 --> 01:15:10.376
Go...

01:15:31.292 --> 01:15:32.292
Chief,

01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:37.084
are they sending us on a suicide mission?

01:15:37.334 --> 01:15:38.376
Are you afraid to die?

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:39.709
How is this possible?

01:15:40.126 --> 01:15:41.959
How formidable is the Ming Army?

01:15:44.584 --> 01:15:46.334
We're their biggest threat.

01:15:47.667 --> 01:15:48.501
But...

01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:50.251
I'm more worried

01:15:51.209 --> 01:15:53.167
when they get a glimpse of us,

01:15:53.751 --> 01:15:55.709
they'll run with their tails between their legs.

01:15:59.792 --> 01:16:00.876
Oh

01:16:01.167 --> 01:16:03.334
I need women.

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:07.459
The thought of them makes me excited.

01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:10.334
The Ming Army is coming!

01:16:10.876 --> 01:16:13.959
Finish them off and I'll get a woman in Ninghai.

01:16:14.001 --> 01:16:15.209
Absolutely!

01:16:15.917 --> 01:16:18.584
If you want women and money,

01:16:18.959 --> 01:16:20.459
go to Taizhou.

01:16:21.001 --> 01:16:23.667
They have things that can satisfy us.

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:26.042
I need money.

01:16:26.292 --> 01:16:30.084
Ask for our reward after this.

01:16:30.542 --> 01:16:33.042
I want to go home and drink.

01:16:33.959 --> 01:16:34.709
Chief!

01:16:35.001 --> 01:16:36.542
The Ming Army is up ahead.

01:16:37.834 --> 01:16:39.459
They came here to die.

01:16:39.501 --> 01:16:40.334
Go!

01:16:51.501 --> 01:16:53.001
Come on, Chief...

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.417
act like a general.

01:16:56.292 --> 01:16:57.084
General?

01:16:57.376 --> 01:16:58.542
This is great!.

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:05.417
Let's go!

01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:07.876
Let's go!

01:17:24.251 --> 01:17:25.584
Didn't they say 20,000 men?

01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:27.959
Never mind that.

01:17:28.542 --> 01:17:30.334
Tell the others to split up.

01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:31.376
Watch out for an ambush.

01:17:31.626 --> 01:17:32.209
Yes, sir!.

01:17:33.292 --> 01:17:34.042
Listen up!

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:35.959
Split up the formation.

01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:55.001
Wait!

01:17:55.542 --> 01:17:56.292
Rifles!

01:17:56.917 --> 01:17:59.501
Rifles!

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:01.876
Fire!.

01:18:14.126 --> 01:18:15.251
Charge!

01:18:44.126 --> 01:18:44.626
Stop!

01:18:51.876 --> 01:18:52.709
Block!

01:19:07.084 --> 01:19:08.042
Spears!

01:19:18.584 --> 01:19:19.084
Drag them away!

01:19:20.334 --> 01:19:21.209
Three-eyed hand cannons!

01:19:22.501 --> 01:19:23.167
Get down!

01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:24.584
Fire!.

01:19:26.376 --> 01:19:27.542
What's going on?

01:19:28.876 --> 01:19:30.917
Fall back!

01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:38.959
Back up...

01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:46.334
(Over 300 pirates died while only
a few Ming soldiers were injured.)

01:19:46.376 --> 01:19:47.251
Jiguang,

01:19:48.876 --> 01:19:50.167
a message from Commander Hu.

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:51.709
There are Japanese soldiers in Xinhe!

01:19:54.209 --> 01:19:55.042
Dacheng!

01:19:55.751 --> 01:19:57.042
Japanese soldiers attacked our homes.

01:19:59.209 --> 01:20:00.292
What did you say?

01:20:00.459 --> 01:20:01.917
Japanese soldiers attacked our homes.

01:20:02.584 --> 01:20:03.626
What should we do?

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:06.626
General Qi,

01:20:06.959 --> 01:20:08.126
the pirates went after Xinhe.

01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:09.542
Let's hurry back.

01:20:10.126 --> 01:20:11.626
That's right!. Let's go!

01:20:11.751 --> 01:20:14.417
Let's go back!

01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:19.292
Don't let them fool you.

01:20:19.626 --> 01:20:21.251
You think they came all this way

01:20:21.376 --> 01:20:22.667
to take Xinhe?

01:20:22.917 --> 01:20:23.626
Xinhe

01:20:23.751 --> 01:20:24.792
is where our families are.

01:20:24.959 --> 01:20:26.876
Yes, our families are there.

01:20:26.917 --> 01:20:28.417
Come over here...

01:20:28.959 --> 01:20:29.709
Look!

01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.876
Take a look,

01:20:33.542 --> 01:20:35.417
Ningha...

01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:37.792
Xinhe...

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:39.084
Why?

01:20:39.459 --> 01:20:41.292
To cover up their real target.

01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:42.792
Taizhou.

01:20:43.626 --> 01:20:45.126
Taizhou is the provincial capital.

01:20:45.584 --> 01:20:46.709
To the pirates,

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:48.876
it's worth a lot more.

01:20:49.251 --> 01:20:49.876
Jiguang,

01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:51.667
your wife is there.

01:20:52.334 --> 01:20:54.542
She's precisely the reason I'm not worried.

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.876
Only 200 men are stationed in Xinhe.

01:20:58.251 --> 01:20:59.001
That's not enough.

01:20:59.959 --> 01:21:01.042
That's quite enough.

01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:02.917
Don't forget,

01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:05.126
my wife is invincible.

01:21:09.501 --> 01:21:10.292
How about...

01:21:10.584 --> 01:21:11.251
Lou Nan,

01:21:11.459 --> 01:21:14.459
take half the troops with you back to Xinhe.

01:21:14.584 --> 01:21:17.417
Then meet us in Taizhou.

01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:18.751
Dacheng,

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:19.959
we should protect our homes and defend our state.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:21.501
But without a home, who cares about the state?

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:22.126
Shut up!

01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:25.042
If General Qi is not worried,

01:21:25.417 --> 01:21:26.501
why should you be?

01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:27.584
Go!

01:21:28.084 --> 01:21:29.042
Get ready to leave.

01:21:29.167 --> 01:21:29.834
Dacheng...

01:21:30.042 --> 01:21:30.751
Go!

01:21:30.959 --> 01:21:31.834
Come on...

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.251
General,

01:21:39.251 --> 01:21:40.626
we only have 3,000 men.

01:21:41.334 --> 01:21:42.709
If we split the troops in half,

01:21:43.251 --> 01:21:44.834
can we take on

01:21:45.459 --> 01:21:46.334
20,000 Japanese soldiers?

01:21:46.626 --> 01:21:47.709
We'll have to.

01:21:48.084 --> 01:21:49.251
We can't lose Taizhou.

01:21:50.376 --> 01:21:53.001
Our families are in your hands.

01:21:53.626 --> 01:21:54.376
Jiguang,

01:21:55.376 --> 01:21:57.959
we can still make Taizhou in time after Xinhe.

01:21:58.626 --> 01:21:59.376
Shut up!

01:22:00.209 --> 01:22:01.417
Another word out of you,

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:02.501
I'll have you beheaded.

01:22:05.334 --> 01:22:05.917
Very well.

01:22:06.126 --> 01:22:06.792
General,

01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:08.542
rest assured

01:22:09.542 --> 01:22:11.126
if anything happens to Xinhe,

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:12.292
Lou Nan

01:22:12.584 --> 01:22:14.251
will not come back alive.

01:22:14.792 --> 01:22:15.584
Thank you.

01:22:22.834 --> 01:22:24.251
Pack up everything.

01:22:24.334 --> 01:22:26.126
Take whatever we can.

01:22:26.584 --> 01:22:27.459
On the double...

01:22:33.042 --> 01:22:34.209
Go...

01:22:38.542 --> 01:22:39.501
Madam Qi,

01:22:40.001 --> 01:22:41.667
why don't you understand?

01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:44.626
Over 10,000 Japanese soldiers
will be in Xinhe soon.

01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:48.001
I already sent a message to General Qi.

01:22:48.376 --> 01:22:50.959
Listen to me and pack your things.

01:22:51.459 --> 01:22:52.792
I'll escort you out of town.

01:22:52.834 --> 01:22:54.501
Then what will happen to Xinhe?

01:22:57.001 --> 01:22:58.792
Village soldiers

01:22:58.834 --> 01:23:01.626
are fighting outside the city right now.

01:23:02.042 --> 01:23:03.667
We have less than

01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:06.876
200 soldiers in Xinhe,

01:23:07.084 --> 01:23:08.209
- how can...
- Madam Qi!

01:23:08.459 --> 01:23:09.667
They say the pirates are coming.

01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:10.459
What should we do?

01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:11.459
See?

01:23:16.626 --> 01:23:18.876
Sound the bell and summon everyone in town.

01:23:20.251 --> 01:23:20.876
Let's go!

01:23:20.917 --> 01:23:22.542
Xiao Mou, bring my armor.

01:23:22.792 --> 01:23:24.209
What are you doing?

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.209
Hurry up...

01:23:26.542 --> 01:23:27.626
You think this is a game?

01:23:28.209 --> 01:23:30.001
We're going to war! People may die!.

01:23:30.084 --> 01:23:31.917
Have you seen a pirate? I have!

01:23:32.251 --> 01:23:33.792
I killed some of them!

01:23:36.126 --> 01:23:37.292
Time is running out.

01:23:49.501 --> 01:23:51.042
I am General Qi's wife.

01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:55.001
I cannot run away
and abandon the people of Xinhe.

01:23:55.251 --> 01:23:56.417
If you want to leave,

01:23:57.167 --> 01:23:58.167
go ahead.

01:24:01.917 --> 01:24:04.126
Why can't I reason with her?

01:24:08.542 --> 01:24:10.167
Let's go.

01:24:14.001 --> 01:24:14.626
Don't go!

01:24:16.459 --> 01:24:17.376
What's the use of running?

01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:18.751
We might as well stay and fight.

01:24:22.251 --> 01:24:23.001
Come on...

01:24:23.417 --> 01:24:24.876
Madam Qi came to get weapons.

01:24:25.501 --> 01:24:27.667
Didn't we agree someone will guard the city?

01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:28.792
They were knocked out cold.

01:24:34.626 --> 01:24:35.459
Wait up, Madam!

01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:36.334
Step aside!

01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:38.334
Step aside!

01:24:38.417 --> 01:24:39.751
Don't leave!.

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:58.834
Don't leave!.

01:24:59.292 --> 01:25:01.167
Auntie, drink some water.

01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:02.876
Be careful!

01:25:03.876 --> 01:25:05.084
Here, drink some water.

01:25:08.584 --> 01:25:09.167
Madam,

01:25:09.292 --> 01:25:11.959
will General Qi be back in time?

01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:14.376
Yes, he will.

01:25:15.209 --> 01:25:16.167
That's good.

01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:17.542
Don't worry, folks.

01:25:17.834 --> 01:25:19.126
General Qi will be back.

01:25:19.834 --> 01:25:21.042
Very well.

01:25:21.084 --> 01:25:22.917
We'll guard the city with our lives.

01:25:24.417 --> 01:25:25.209
Brother Yang,

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:31.542
what are you doing here?

01:25:32.459 --> 01:25:33.542
You're not afraid to die?

01:25:37.459 --> 01:25:38.417
I am.

01:25:39.084 --> 01:25:40.501
But if you're staying,

01:25:41.084 --> 01:25:42.584
how can we leave

01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:45.126
and become a laughing stock?

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:48.751
You...

01:25:48.792 --> 01:25:49.667
Brother...

01:25:49.876 --> 01:25:51.542
Teach them how to use the hand cannons.

01:25:51.584 --> 01:25:52.584
Come on...

01:25:53.292 --> 01:25:54.001
Madam,

01:25:54.459 --> 01:25:57.334
it's my duty to guard the city.

01:25:58.126 --> 01:25:59.251
Leave that to me.

01:26:04.126 --> 01:26:04.876
Keep up.

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:05.667
Hurry!

01:26:06.126 --> 01:26:07.709
Keep it up.

01:26:10.876 --> 01:26:13.376
We shall prevail!. Hurry!

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:20.792
We will wait till midnight to make our move.

01:26:20.917 --> 01:26:21.751
Yes, sir!.

01:26:22.126 --> 01:26:23.209
Run! Hurry up!

01:26:24.084 --> 01:26:24.876
Run!

01:26:33.167 --> 01:26:35.667
Chief, they seem quite energetic.

01:26:36.251 --> 01:26:38.542
Let Qi live a few more hours.

01:26:40.001 --> 01:26:41.959
He doesn't know he's walking into a trap.

01:26:43.209 --> 01:26:45.376
When he takes on the sly old fox,

01:26:45.376 --> 01:26:47.209
we'll ambush them from behind.

01:26:49.292 --> 01:26:50.417
Brilliant!

01:26:51.417 --> 01:26:52.292
General,

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:54.959
the Japanese soldiers encamped in Huajie,
4 miles outside the city.

01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:57.876
Commander Hu and 3,000 men have
already set up defense in the city.

01:26:59.334 --> 01:27:00.584
They're after Taizhou after all.

01:27:01.959 --> 01:27:03.292
How many men do they have?

01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:05.167
Between 8,000 to 10,000.

01:27:07.209 --> 01:27:08.542
Jimei! Banner!

01:27:08.584 --> 01:27:09.042
Yes, sir!.

01:27:10.542 --> 01:27:11.126
Here!

01:27:13.417 --> 01:27:16.292
Give this to Commander Hu.

01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:17.751
Ask him to hoist it.

01:27:17.834 --> 01:27:19.626
Tell him I'll be back for it.

01:27:19.959 --> 01:27:20.834
Yes, sir!.

01:27:22.042 --> 01:27:22.792
Let's go!

01:27:32.667 --> 01:27:35.542
If ronins defeated him in Ninghai.

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:40.084
I'll let the ronins attack Taizhou

01:27:41.792 --> 01:27:44.334
and our troops won't suffer any casualties.

01:27:44.834 --> 01:27:49.126
That is so discouraging.

01:27:53.917 --> 01:27:56.292
Once we get rid of Qi,

01:27:58.292 --> 01:28:01.334
the Ming won't be so determined
to build a strong army

01:28:01.917 --> 01:28:04.084
and we'll have a chance to win.

01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:06.251
Sir,

01:28:06.376 --> 01:28:09.209
Qi's troops showed up on Hua Street!.

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:14.292
Someone is about to fall into a trap.

01:28:33.626 --> 01:28:35.834
This is the new army?

01:28:37.334 --> 01:28:39.209
What kind of formation is this?

01:28:41.251 --> 01:28:42.792
Look at those weapons.

01:28:42.834 --> 01:28:43.751
I have never seen that before.

01:28:43.792 --> 01:28:45.084
You haven't either?

01:28:46.292 --> 01:28:50.376
Tell Oda and his troops
to encircle the Ming troops.

01:28:51.542 --> 01:28:52.417
Also...

01:28:54.251 --> 01:28:56.626
find long bamboo poles to tackle their shields.

01:28:57.334 --> 01:28:58.251
Yes, sir!.

01:29:02.959 --> 01:29:04.667
Three-eyed hand cannons! Fire!

01:29:07.001 --> 01:29:08.876
Fall back!

01:29:09.251 --> 01:29:10.167
Fall back!

01:29:11.084 --> 01:29:12.001
Fall back!

01:29:13.084 --> 01:29:14.209
After them!

01:29:22.584 --> 01:29:23.334
Dacheng, follow them.

01:29:23.501 --> 01:29:25.042
Move it! Keep up!

01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:26.667
Bring up the rear!

01:29:26.792 --> 01:29:27.209
Okay!

01:29:29.542 --> 01:29:30.792
Hurry!

01:29:38.126 --> 01:29:39.334
Back up...

01:29:48.084 --> 01:29:51.042
Bring the shields forward!

01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:54.042
Wolf Brushes!.

01:29:55.126 --> 01:29:56.709
They're not long enough!

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:58.584
Hold them off!

01:29:59.834 --> 01:30:00.626
Hold them off!

01:30:05.626 --> 01:30:06.417
Fall back!

01:30:29.834 --> 01:30:31.626
They fell for it.

01:30:32.001 --> 01:30:33.792
They're trapped.

01:30:34.334 --> 01:30:36.042
Chief, what do we do now?

01:30:36.292 --> 01:30:38.792
Let's go find the old fox.

01:30:38.834 --> 01:30:40.751
Watch out!

01:30:59.084 --> 01:30:59.709
Open!

01:31:01.084 --> 01:31:01.626
Go!

01:31:26.084 --> 01:31:26.834
Dacheng!

01:31:27.167 --> 01:31:27.751
General!

01:31:27.792 --> 01:31:29.876
Their commander is at the northeast corner.

01:31:30.042 --> 01:31:31.001
Split up

01:31:31.126 --> 01:31:32.042
and go through the alleys.

01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:33.459
I'll meet you at the northeast corner.

01:31:33.751 --> 01:31:36.292
Whoever finds the commander
should fire the signal arrow.

01:31:36.584 --> 01:31:37.334
You come with me.

01:31:39.334 --> 01:31:41.209
Follow me. Split up.

01:31:41.917 --> 01:31:42.667
Charge!

01:31:43.084 --> 01:31:44.876
Hurry... cover up for us!

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:47.501
Hurry!

01:31:56.584 --> 01:31:58.292
Sir,

01:31:59.417 --> 01:32:05.334
Qi's troops are moving
towards us through the alleys.

01:32:05.709 --> 01:32:08.542
Qi?

01:32:09.751 --> 01:32:11.792
Let's give him a warm welcome.

01:32:20.376 --> 01:32:23.376
Drive them back to the main street

01:32:24.167 --> 01:32:27.292
so we can encircle them and take them out.

01:32:27.834 --> 01:32:33.209
Poor Qi.

01:32:33.334 --> 01:32:34.126
Sensei,

01:32:34.626 --> 01:32:35.917
our Guns Unit

01:32:36.084 --> 01:32:38.334
should not remain in the rear.

01:32:38.626 --> 01:32:42.126
Guard the back of our camp
with Kohata and the ronins.

01:32:43.376 --> 01:32:45.459
Don't underestimate your task.

01:32:49.792 --> 01:32:50.667
Just do it.

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:53.834
Let's go!

01:32:56.584 --> 01:32:57.709
Come on!

01:33:14.834 --> 01:33:17.001
Charge!

01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:39.584
Dacheng, how is your leg?

01:33:39.626 --> 01:33:40.292
I'm fine.

01:33:40.334 --> 01:33:41.084
Go back

01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:42.042
and bring the Crouching Tiger Cannon.

01:33:42.084 --> 01:33:43.792
You must keep up. Go!

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:44.709
See you on the other side!.

01:34:04.751 --> 01:34:05.709
This way.

01:34:19.042 --> 01:34:19.876
Sir,

01:34:20.501 --> 01:34:23.042
some Ming troops
were discovered near Xiyi Lane.

01:34:24.667 --> 01:34:25.584
Sir,

01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:28.126
Kinoshita's men are
fighting Ming troops in the market.

01:34:28.167 --> 01:34:30.459
We also found Ming troops near the shrine.

01:34:30.792 --> 01:34:32.126
Try your best to cut them off

01:34:32.292 --> 01:34:33.959
and take them out completely.

01:34:34.251 --> 01:34:35.042
Yes, sir!.

01:34:35.542 --> 01:34:36.876
Sir!

01:34:37.167 --> 01:34:39.167
The Ming troops are approaching!

01:34:43.126 --> 01:34:45.334
We found their commander, get ready!.

01:34:48.501 --> 01:34:50.417
Bamboo pole formation!.

01:34:51.209 --> 01:34:52.584
Ready!

01:34:54.292 --> 01:34:55.126
Charge!

01:35:02.959 --> 01:35:04.001
Shields!

01:35:32.917 --> 01:35:34.792
Others are contributing,

01:35:37.417 --> 01:35:39.292
while we're here shooting the breeze.

01:35:42.917 --> 01:35:43.834
Master Yamagawa,

01:35:44.542 --> 01:35:46.292
maybe I don't understand,

01:35:47.584 --> 01:35:49.667
but I thought you were the commander.

01:35:52.959 --> 01:35:54.042
Why?

01:35:55.167 --> 01:35:56.917
Why aren't we spearheading this campaign?

01:35:57.334 --> 01:35:59.209
If we send in the Guns Unit,

01:35:59.751 --> 01:36:02.376
we can stop Qi's advances.

01:36:02.959 --> 01:36:05.626
The old fox is worried
if anything should happen to you,

01:36:05.876 --> 01:36:07.667
your father may blame him.

01:36:08.501 --> 01:36:11.292
But it's different for you.

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:15.251
Anyone can topple him in an instant.

01:36:15.917 --> 01:36:19.167
If your Guns Unit join forces with me,

01:36:20.084 --> 01:36:21.292
no matter who it is,

01:36:21.751 --> 01:36:23.501
we can instantly take them out.

01:36:26.167 --> 01:36:27.751
I want revenge,

01:36:28.126 --> 01:36:30.459
while you want a reputation.

01:36:42.584 --> 01:36:43.542
Me?

01:36:46.209 --> 01:36:47.959
I want to be a genuine samurai.

01:36:52.376 --> 01:36:54.501
To be a samurai,

01:36:55.584 --> 01:36:57.667
you must stop your plundering and rape!

01:36:58.001 --> 01:36:59.584
Of course I know that!

01:37:00.167 --> 01:37:01.001
Also,

01:37:02.292 --> 01:37:06.376
I like your straight talk.

01:37:08.667 --> 01:37:09.334
Let's do it.

01:37:09.667 --> 01:37:10.167
Good!

01:37:10.917 --> 01:37:11.834
Bring us wine!.

01:37:12.792 --> 01:37:13.292
Come on!

01:37:21.167 --> 01:37:22.834
They're guarding more than they are fighting.

01:37:22.917 --> 01:37:26.417
Did he invent this passive attack?

01:37:28.084 --> 01:37:30.251
They're humans after all.

01:37:31.209 --> 01:37:33.751
Waiting too long will wear them out.

01:37:33.834 --> 01:37:35.709
They can't wait much longer.

01:37:35.959 --> 01:37:38.001
Be patient and carry on with the attack.

01:37:38.542 --> 01:37:41.251
Make headway if you can find a breach.

01:37:42.042 --> 01:37:42.501
Yes, sir!.

01:37:42.626 --> 01:37:44.626
We're exhausted! We can't break through!.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:45.751
Where are the Crouching Tiger Cannons?

01:37:45.792 --> 01:37:46.626
They can't keep up!

01:37:46.959 --> 01:37:47.876
Hold them off!

01:37:48.667 --> 01:37:50.001
Don't back down!

01:37:50.376 --> 01:37:51.792
Charge forward!

01:37:53.542 --> 01:37:54.334
We can't get through!.

01:37:54.376 --> 01:37:55.626
The road ahead is blocked!

01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:56.667
We can't get through!.

01:38:00.126 --> 01:38:01.542
Come this way. Hurry!

01:38:05.584 --> 01:38:06.626
Can you aim better?

01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:07.542
We're at war!

01:38:07.626 --> 01:38:08.959
This is the right direction.

01:38:09.042 --> 01:38:09.709
Go back!

01:38:10.001 --> 01:38:11.542
Your broken compass is useless!

01:38:12.501 --> 01:38:13.251
Watch out!

01:38:13.667 --> 01:38:14.501
Shields!

01:38:15.959 --> 01:38:16.709
Three-eyed hand cannons!

01:38:25.334 --> 01:38:26.084
Kid!

01:38:28.751 --> 01:38:29.501
Kid!

01:38:30.376 --> 01:38:31.126
Kid!

01:38:31.751 --> 01:38:32.667
What's wrong with you, kid?

01:38:32.834 --> 01:38:34.209
Wake up, kid!

01:38:34.334 --> 01:38:35.626
This isn't funny, kid!

01:38:37.042 --> 01:38:38.126
Wake up, kid!

01:38:39.459 --> 01:38:40.167
Kid!

01:38:40.501 --> 01:38:41.209
Wake up!

01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:46.376
Wake up, kid! I'll give you a uniform!.

01:39:19.417 --> 01:39:21.792
What the hell is this?

01:39:22.209 --> 01:39:26.584
He wants to help you wrap this up quickly.

01:39:27.876 --> 01:39:29.959
Can you guard the back in his place?

01:39:30.001 --> 01:39:31.209
No problem!

01:39:31.542 --> 01:39:33.292
Follow me!

01:39:40.876 --> 01:39:41.917
Guns Unit!.

01:39:42.834 --> 01:39:43.834
Ready!

01:39:48.334 --> 01:39:49.251
Aim... fire!

01:39:49.792 --> 01:39:51.917
Go!

01:40:43.376 --> 01:40:44.751
Make way!.

01:40:45.292 --> 01:40:46.584
Step aside!

01:40:46.751 --> 01:40:48.042
Move!

01:40:48.084 --> 01:40:49.751
Damn it!

01:41:08.917 --> 01:41:09.917
Duck!.

01:41:17.292 --> 01:41:18.001
Master Yamagawa!

01:41:50.959 --> 01:41:54.792
Defeating 20,000 pirates with only 1,000 men

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.417
has not been easy.

01:42:00.917 --> 01:42:05.751
A high price to pay.

01:42:14.001 --> 01:42:15.167
Where is General Qi?

01:42:15.376 --> 01:42:17.501
He went after the pirates.

01:42:17.792 --> 01:42:19.126
They are the leaders of the pirates.

01:42:19.209 --> 01:42:20.584
We can't let them get away.

01:42:23.001 --> 01:42:24.876
Jiguang,

01:42:27.459 --> 01:42:30.584
you abandoned your family in Xinhe.

01:42:35.001 --> 01:42:36.042
General Lu.

01:42:36.209 --> 01:42:36.667
Yes?

01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:37.417
Hurry...

01:42:38.792 --> 01:42:40.792
Head back up to Xinhe.

01:42:42.292 --> 01:42:43.334
Let's hope

01:42:44.751 --> 01:42:46.542
Xinhe is still defensible.

01:42:47.667 --> 01:42:48.417
Okay!

01:42:49.167 --> 01:42:50.042
Follow me.

01:42:58.959 --> 01:43:01.501
Bring the Three-eyed hand cannons
when they're ready!

01:43:03.751 --> 01:43:05.292
Keep them off the city gate!.

01:43:29.626 --> 01:43:30.459
Madam!.

01:43:31.209 --> 01:43:32.792
A pretty lady!.

01:43:40.876 --> 01:43:41.917
You're dead!

01:43:43.834 --> 01:43:44.334
Madam!.

01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:47.376
Are you alright, Madam?

01:43:52.376 --> 01:43:53.917
Charge!

01:43:55.626 --> 01:43:56.876
Charge!

01:43:56.917 --> 01:43:57.792
Xiao Mou!

01:43:58.292 --> 01:43:59.084
Come on!

01:43:59.792 --> 01:44:00.959
Charge!

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:02.917
Break down the city gate!.

01:44:13.209 --> 01:44:13.959
Xiao Mou!

01:44:14.001 --> 01:44:15.876
Go block the city gate!

01:44:15.917 --> 01:44:17.501
You two give Xiao Mou a hand. Hurry!

01:44:19.334 --> 01:44:20.751
Hurry, load the gunpowder.

01:44:20.792 --> 01:44:22.459
Keep them off the city gate!.

01:44:22.667 --> 01:44:24.376
Keep them off the city gate!.

01:44:28.501 --> 01:44:29.584
Fall back!

01:44:31.959 --> 01:44:34.042
Help carry this...

01:44:34.792 --> 01:44:36.376
Hurry, block the city gate!

01:44:42.459 --> 01:44:43.334
Team 2,

01:44:43.917 --> 01:44:44.834
move!

01:45:01.334 --> 01:45:02.376
Charge!

01:45:03.876 --> 01:45:05.292
Seize the commander!

01:45:15.417 --> 01:45:17.001
Charge!

01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:25.292
Charge!

01:45:37.376 --> 01:45:39.084
Blow up the gate!

01:46:26.917 --> 01:46:27.917
Charge!

01:46:32.084 --> 01:46:32.876
Charge!

01:46:33.001 --> 01:46:34.584
Charge!

01:46:36.292 --> 01:46:37.209
Attack!.

01:46:39.834 --> 01:46:40.542
Charge!

01:47:25.792 --> 01:47:26.626
Brother Yang!

01:47:29.792 --> 01:47:30.459
Brother Yang!

01:47:32.917 --> 01:47:33.959
Madam,

01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:36.417
the city is safe.

01:47:41.084 --> 01:47:42.542
We did it.

01:47:43.417 --> 01:47:44.834
General Qi is back.

01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:47.251
The city is safe.

01:47:48.751 --> 01:47:50.042
Good.

01:47:50.959 --> 01:47:56.459
I did not embarrass General Qi.

01:48:01.084 --> 01:48:03.209
Brother Yang!

01:48:03.834 --> 01:48:04.917
Brother Yang!

01:48:06.167 --> 01:48:07.584
Brother Yang!

01:48:15.501 --> 01:48:17.042
Brother Yang!

01:49:47.876 --> 01:49:49.459
The others can't keep up.

01:49:50.126 --> 01:49:51.167
Shall we wait?

01:50:20.626 --> 01:50:22.834
The Ming troops are catching up.

01:50:23.126 --> 01:50:25.334
Don't worry, get on board.

01:50:25.626 --> 01:50:28.084
They can't get across the mudflats.

01:50:32.334 --> 01:50:34.709
Look! What is that?

01:50:38.751 --> 01:50:41.334
Let's go...

01:50:53.917 --> 01:50:54.917
Fall back... hurry!

01:50:59.167 --> 01:51:01.334
Hurry! Get on board!

01:51:03.126 --> 01:51:03.751
Go!

01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:07.334
Hurry!

01:51:44.376 --> 01:51:45.709
Get on board!

01:51:46.584 --> 01:51:47.876
Hurry!

01:51:50.042 --> 01:51:51.959
Close the door!

01:51:52.209 --> 01:51:57.834
Get on board!

01:51:58.251 --> 01:51:59.084
Hurry!

01:52:01.209 --> 01:52:03.042
Hurry! They're catching up!

01:52:03.084 --> 01:52:05.876
Hurry, we have to set sail.

01:52:20.917 --> 01:52:22.792
We can't make it to the vessel.

01:52:22.917 --> 01:52:25.001
Board the small ship!

01:52:28.834 --> 01:52:30.001
One... two... pull!

01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:31.709
One... two... pull!

01:52:32.501 --> 01:52:33.501
One... two... pull!

01:52:34.167 --> 01:52:35.376
Get ready to board!

01:52:35.417 --> 01:52:36.209
Let's go together.

01:52:38.167 --> 01:52:39.001
Master Yamagawa!

01:52:39.667 --> 01:52:41.626
This is my final order to you!

01:52:41.751 --> 01:52:42.709
Get on board.

01:52:44.417 --> 01:52:45.584
Let's go together.

01:52:50.792 --> 01:52:51.834
Sensei,

01:52:53.167 --> 01:52:54.667
I was wrong!

01:52:56.251 --> 01:52:57.001
Now,

01:52:57.667 --> 01:52:59.792
I finally understand
why you have been so prudent.

01:53:00.876 --> 01:53:01.834
From now on,

01:53:02.292 --> 01:53:04.417
I won't be arrogant anymore!

01:53:05.584 --> 01:53:06.251
Sensei,

01:53:06.667 --> 01:53:08.417
come with us.

01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:10.334
I'm glad you learned your lesson.

01:53:10.626 --> 01:53:13.709
We only have several hundred men left from 20,000.

01:53:14.542 --> 01:53:17.084
I can't go home like this.

01:53:21.792 --> 01:53:25.042
Tell my Lord

01:53:25.251 --> 01:53:26.917
the Matsura clan

01:53:27.542 --> 01:53:30.792
should stop dreaming!

01:53:31.751 --> 01:53:32.584
Hurry!

01:53:33.459 --> 01:53:35.001
Get on board!

01:53:35.834 --> 01:53:37.709
Master Yamagawa!

01:53:38.209 --> 01:53:40.251
We must go!

01:53:40.459 --> 01:53:41.876
Sensei!

01:53:42.167 --> 01:53:44.376
- Sensei!
- Get on board!

01:53:44.834 --> 01:53:46.751
Go!

01:53:47.001 --> 01:53:47.792
Master Yamagawa!

01:53:49.251 --> 01:53:50.542
Master Yamagawa!

01:53:51.167 --> 01:53:52.501
Get home safely!

01:53:57.501 --> 01:53:58.376
Master Yamagawa!

01:55:44.834 --> 01:55:48.667
The Ming Army was reborn under Qi's command.

01:55:50.334 --> 01:55:52.209
It's unbelievable.

01:55:53.251 --> 01:55:54.751
They became stronger.

01:55:55.709 --> 01:55:57.834
That's the amazing thing about Qi.

01:55:58.501 --> 01:56:01.042
He made them believe they could become stronger.

01:56:34.209 --> 01:56:36.251
The strength of an army can change

01:56:36.959 --> 01:56:38.542
just like water can change its form.

01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:44.751
He who can prevail in chaos is regarded as a God.

01:57:57.334 --> 01:57:59.876
General Qi said prisoners of war must be spared!

01:58:00.209 --> 01:58:01.584
Let me go!.

01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:03.917
This is an order!

01:58:26.501 --> 01:58:27.626
Please.

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:24.834
You're a fast runner.

02:03:30.459 --> 02:03:31.917
We accept your surrender.

02:03:32.834 --> 02:03:34.542
May I know your name?

02:03:40.584 --> 02:03:42.751
The name is not important.

02:03:44.042 --> 02:03:45.709
I am a pirate.

02:04:12.251 --> 02:04:13.167
Come on!

02:04:15.209 --> 02:04:15.917
Jimei!

02:04:30.084 --> 02:04:32.001
Qi Jiguang!
