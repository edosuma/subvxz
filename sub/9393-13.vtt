This is history, Brian.

09:47.422 --> 09:48.856
A key moment in the
history of happiness.

09:48.890 --> 09:50.090
Have a seat.

09:56.814 --> 09:59.683
♪ I cried a tear

09:59.717 --> 10:03.487
♪ You wiped it dry

10:03.538 --> 10:07.040
♪ I was confused

10:07.075 --> 10:11.745
♪ You cleared my mind

10:11.779 --> 10:15.315
♪ I sold my soul

10:15.350 --> 10:18.468
♪ You bought it back for me

10:18.503 --> 10:21.672
♪ And held me up

10:21.706 --> 10:26.426
♪ And gave me dignity

10:26.461 --> 10:29.062
♪ Somehow you needed me

10:29.097 --> 10:33.016
♪ You gave me strength

10:33.067 --> 10:36.737
♪ To stand alone again

10:36.771 --> 10:40.607
♪ To face the world

10:40.641 --> 10:44.161
♪ Out on my own again

10:44.195 --> 10:47.831
♪ You put me high

10:47.865 --> 10:53.486
♪ Upon a pedestal

10:53.504 --> 11:00.110
♪ So high that I could almost
see eternity ♪

11:00.144 --> 11:03.997
♪ You needed me

11:04.015 --> 11:10.687
♪ You needed me...

11:17.028 --> 11:18.879
Some hardcore
, right?

11:18.913 --> 11:20.747
Wow, thank you
for turning me on

11:20.782 --> 11:22.349
to something
so amazing.

11:22.383 --> 11:24.051
Hey, I'm just glad
you enjoyed it.

11:24.085 --> 11:25.352
And I'm sure
Buzz Lightyear

11:25.386 --> 11:28.322
would have enjoyed it if he
had bothered to show up.

11:30.024 --> 11:31.858
Hey, how would you like
to go to my apartment...

11:31.893 --> 11:34.127
and beyond?

11:37.699 --> 11:39.700
Okay, Meg,
I stood outside

11:39.734 --> 11:41.702
Planned Parenthood
for 36 hours

11:41.736 --> 11:42.769
and here are
the pictures

11:42.804 --> 11:44.554
of every girl in
your class who went in.

11:44.589 --> 11:45.672
All right, good.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.940
Now I want you
to call them

11:46.975 --> 11:49.142
as if you're
their dead baby.

11:49.177 --> 11:51.595
No way, that was the last
thing on your list.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.380
I-I can't do this anymore.

11:53.398 --> 11:54.531
Well, you should've
thought of that

11:54.565 --> 11:56.400
before you stole money out
of Mom's purse.

11:56.434 --> 11:57.985
I own you.

11:58.019 --> 11:59.753
Now, here's my
post office key.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.121
I need you to
go downtown

12:01.155 --> 12:02.322
and get the stuff
from my P.O. box.

12:02.357 --> 12:04.024
You-you don't get
your mail here?

12:04.058 --> 12:06.059
No, I get a lot of
private correspondence

12:06.077 --> 12:07.260
from the Netherlands.

12:07.295 --> 12:08.295
Like what?

12:08.329 --> 12:09.629
Like, I'm part
of a group that

12:09.664 --> 12:12.065
kind of trashes Anne
Frank's house every year.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.734
You know what?
No. That's it.

12:13.768 --> 12:16.837
I'm not-I'm not doing
any more of your crap, Meg.

12:16.871 --> 12:18.388
Chris, don't you see?
You have no choice.

12:18.423 --> 12:20.991
I'll just go tell Mom
and Dad about the money

12:21.025 --> 12:23.627
and they'll ground
your ass for a year.

12:23.661 --> 12:25.078
I don't care, tell them.

12:25.096 --> 12:26.563
'Cause I'm not even
going to be here.

12:26.597 --> 12:29.533
I'm going to run away and
no one will ever see me again.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.001
Good, go.

12:31.035 --> 12:32.185
And who's even
going to miss you?

12:32.220 --> 12:33.470
You're just a
little thief.

12:33.521 --> 12:35.222
Where you going, Chris?

12:35.256 --> 12:36.823
Who are you going to turn to?

12:36.858 --> 12:39.242
You don't even have any friends.

12:40.945 --> 12:42.979
Hi. I ran away from home.

12:43.014 --> 12:45.849
Do you mind if I live with you?

12:45.883 --> 12:47.250
Live with me?

12:47.285 --> 12:48.652
My goodness, I feel like

12:48.686 --> 12:51.688
I want to pinch myself
to see if I'm dreaming.

12:53.524 --> 12:56.393
Hot dog, it's real.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.393
Mr. Herbert, it's 6:00,
I'm-I'm not really tired yet.

13:06.427 --> 13:08.428
Well, you had those
three cups of Nyquil.

13:08.463 --> 13:10.163
You'll be down
soon enough.

13:10.198 --> 13:12.299
Okay, good night,
Mr. Herbert.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.801
Sweet dreams, Chris.

13:18.873 --> 13:22.543
Mr. Herbert, what's
life really all about?

13:22.577 --> 13:25.646
Well, I suppose it's
about trying new things;

13:25.680 --> 13:27.848
sampling the sweet
and the savory;

13:27.882 --> 13:30.083
not being afraid
to take everything

13:30.118 --> 13:32.986
life wants to
throw up on into ya.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.087
Wow.

13:34.122 --> 13:35.489
I never looked at it
like that before.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.823
Thanks, Mr. Herbert.

13:41.129 --> 13:42.696
But don't you
think it's scary

13:42.730 --> 13:43.964
to try new things?

13:43.998 --> 13:45.799
No, Chris.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.334
Life is like a
new baseball glove.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.036
At first you think

13:49.070 --> 13:50.804
you're never going to get
a ball in there.

13:50.838 --> 13:53.106
But then you oil it up,
work your fingers

13:53.141 --> 13:55.576
around in there a little,
and pretty soon

13:55.610 --> 13:57.744
you're pitching and catching.

13:57.779 --> 13:59.947
I guess that
makes sense.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.585
Sorry.

14:04.619 --> 14:06.520
You really know how
to waste a Cialis,

14:06.554 --> 14:08.522
don't you?

14:11.125 --> 14:12.659
♪ The snowbird sings the song

14:12.694 --> 14:15.529
♪ He always sings...

14:15.563 --> 14:17.130
You know,
this is definitely

14:17.165 --> 14:18.365
a mystery song for me.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.300
It's so upbeat,
but the lyrics are so dark.

14:20.335 --> 14:22.069
I'm-I'm sorry, are we both
listening to "Snowbird,"

14:22.103 --> 14:23.904
as recorded by
Miss Anne Murray?

14:23.938 --> 14:25.038
Yeah, the woman
in the song

14:25.073 --> 14:26.473
is trying to cope
with getting older

14:26.491 --> 14:27.658
and she feels
trapped because

14:27.692 --> 14:29.593
she knows she can't
do anything about it.

14:29.644 --> 14:31.011
No, no, no, no.

14:31.045 --> 14:32.679
I mean, you're right that
she's feeling trapped,

14:32.714 --> 14:33.947
but the message
is positive.

14:33.982 --> 14:35.449
It's about being trapped
in a bad relationship

14:35.483 --> 14:37.718
and having the guts
to get out of it.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.286
No, no. See, what I hear,
is that the woman

14:39.320 --> 14:40.604
is starting to hate life.

14:40.638 --> 14:43.473
You know the line, "Now I feel
such emptiness within"?

14:43.508 --> 14:45.108
Yeah, I know the song.

14:45.159 --> 14:46.426
Well, Anne Murray feels old.

14:46.461 --> 14:47.494
And then, to make things worse,

14:47.528 --> 14:49.062
the snowbird comes
around every year,

14:49.097 --> 14:50.914
bringing the snow, or "death,"

14:50.948 --> 14:52.366
to remind her that no matter
what she does,

14:52.400 --> 14:54.635
her fate's already written.

14:54.669 --> 14:57.287
Brian, the snowbird has nothing
to do with time or fate.

14:57.322 --> 14:58.555
Well, I disagree.

14:58.589 --> 14:59.890
Look, there's only one
way to settle this.

14:59.924 --> 15:02.626
Only the artist knows the
true meaning of their art.

15:04.162 --> 15:05.629
Now, Ms. O'Keefe, the flowers
in your paintings,

15:05.663 --> 15:07.731
what do they represent?

15:07.765 --> 15:10.967
Oh, wow,
that's a really good question.

15:12.603 --> 15:14.471
La, la, la...

15:15.573 --> 15:18.041
Mm...

15:24.148 --> 15:25.248
Oh, hi, Meg.

15:25.283 --> 15:27.584
Could you tell Chris
breakfast is ready?

15:27.618 --> 15:30.287
Oh, um, I-I-I think
he got up early.

15:30.321 --> 15:32.923
He, um, said something
about a fat kid rally

15:32.957 --> 15:34.257
at Little Caesars.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.159
Huh, it's not like Chris
to miss breakfast.

15:36.194 --> 15:37.527
Oh, don't worry, Mom.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.130
I... I'm sure
he'll be home later.

15:40.164 --> 15:41.264
Well, I hope so.

15:41.299 --> 15:43.016
We were supposed
to go to the library

15:43.051 --> 15:44.251
to wipe boogers
in fancy books.

15:44.285 --> 15:45.919
I like to wipe mine
in Bronte novels.

15:45.953 --> 15:49.473
It's like a time bomb to
gross out lonely chicks.

15:49.507 --> 15:51.541
Oh, Heathcliff.

15:51.576 --> 15:52.759
Oh, come on.

15:52.794 --> 15:55.295
I want so little.

15:58.366 --> 16:00.734
Chris, what did you
do with my video tapes?

16:00.768 --> 16:03.503
I had a whole system.

16:03.538 --> 16:05.072
I was trying to find a
good movie to watch.

16:05.106 --> 16:06.673
I've never even heard of
most of these.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.275
"Jeffrey at the Park."

16:08.309 --> 16:10.794
"Mikey's Scoliosis Exam."

16:10.828 --> 16:14.347
"Nephew Somersault Compilation."

16:14.382 --> 16:15.862
Well, even if you
never heard of them,

16:15.883 --> 16:17.150
I assume you heard
of the alphabet.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.853
You want to explain to me how
"Sammy Popsicle"

16:19.887 --> 16:23.023
comes before "Napping, Various"?

16:23.057 --> 16:24.241
Geez, I'm sorry.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.942
Well, can we
watch "Lost Boys"?

16:25.977 --> 16:27.177
I've heard of that one.

16:27.211 --> 16:30.580
Those... those are
different lost boys.

16:37.772 --> 16:38.893
Are you whistling
"Snowbird"?

16:38.940 --> 16:40.173
Yeah.

16:40.191 --> 16:41.224
That's awesome.

16:41.275 --> 16:43.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
why do you get to ring it?

16:43.795 --> 16:45.095
Because I was
into her first.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.013
Let's flip for it, or...

16:47.131 --> 16:48.298
I can't believe
you did that.

16:48.332 --> 16:49.866
I cannot believe
you just did that.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.051
Will you stop it.

16:51.085 --> 16:52.235
She's going to
think we're weird.

16:52.270 --> 16:53.286
Hi. Can I help you?

16:53.321 --> 16:54.321
Hi. Miss Murray.

16:54.355 --> 16:55.755
My name's Brian Griffin.

16:55.789 --> 16:57.557
Uh, first of all,
I just want to tell you

16:57.592 --> 16:59.125
what a huge fan I am.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.694
Aw, that's very
sweet of you.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.862
And I'm Stewie.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.731
I'm the one who sent
you the vibrators.

17:04.765 --> 17:06.233
Well, I'm glad you
enjoy my music.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.400
Would you like to come in?

17:07.435 --> 17:08.652
We'd love to.

17:08.685 --> 17:10.185
Wow, nothing says success

17:10.238 --> 17:12.622
like free on a Tuesday
at 3:00 p.m.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.691
I'll get there.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.294
So, Miss Murray,
the reason we came

17:17.328 --> 17:19.095
is that we have a question
about "Snowbird."

17:19.130 --> 17:20.714
It's about
a relationship, right?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.715
No, no, it's obviously
about the fear of growing old.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.470
You know, I think
you're both kind of right.

17:24.484 --> 17:26.152
I guess I always thought it was
about human limitation,

17:26.186 --> 17:28.705
both mental and physical.

17:28.739 --> 17:32.042
Okay, that...
that just blew my face off.

17:32.076 --> 17:33.376
Well, I hope
that helps.

17:33.411 --> 17:35.295
It does. Thank you so much,
Miss Murray.

17:35.329 --> 17:36.563
This has been terrific.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.731
Hey, uh, before we go,

17:37.765 --> 17:38.949
do you mind if I
use your restroom?

17:38.983 --> 17:40.317
It was a long
drive up here.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.836
No, go right ahead.

17:42.870 --> 17:44.337
We should do something
without him sometime.

17:44.372 --> 17:46.039
Do you like tapas?

17:46.073 --> 17:47.874
Someone invited me
out for that once.

17:47.909 --> 17:49.526
I thought they said
topless, so I was like,

17:49.560 --> 17:50.660
what?

17:50.695 --> 17:51.695
That's a good story.

17:51.729 --> 17:53.096
Hey, you know,
that was really cool

17:53.130 --> 17:55.165
how you told us what
"Snowbird" was about.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.433
Well, you know,
that's just the way

17:56.467 --> 17:58.018
I always interpreted the song.

17:58.052 --> 17:59.352
But I suppose Gene probably

17:59.387 --> 18:01.021
could have explained
it better than I.

18:01.055 --> 18:02.689
Who's Gene?

18:02.723 --> 18:04.624
Gene MacLellan.
He wrote the song.

18:04.659 --> 18:06.726
I see.

18:06.761 --> 18:08.695
But you wrote all
your other songs, right?

18:08.729 --> 18:10.964
No, all of my songs were
written by other people.

18:10.998 --> 18:12.599
As a singer,
I've been blessed

18:12.633 --> 18:14.968
to interpret the works of
many gifted, sensitive

18:15.002 --> 18:16.236
songwriters.

18:16.270 --> 18:18.872
Oh.

18:18.906 --> 18:21.441
So, you're just
a big  liar?

18:21.475 --> 18:22.709
Sit back down.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.978
All right, come on, Stewie,
let's go home...

18:26.597 --> 18:28.081
Stewie, what the
hell are you doing?

18:28.115 --> 18:29.349
She's a fraud, Brian.
A fraud!

18:29.383 --> 18:31.034
She didn't write any
of her songs.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.969
Well, so, that's the case
with a lot of singers.

18:33.004 --> 18:34.971
It's a very common
industry practice.

18:35.006 --> 18:37.107
Well, then you're all a bunch of
frauds, aren't you?

18:37.141 --> 18:39.042
A bunch of frauds and
charlatans.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.543
You want to be a puppet?

18:40.578 --> 18:42.412
Then sing for your life,
puppet. Come on.

18:42.446 --> 18:46.016
♪ Spread your tiny wings
and fly away! ♪

18:50.488 --> 18:52.222
Come on, Anne, sing along.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.591
You know it. You didn't write
it, but you know it, bitch.

18:58.763 --> 19:03.550

19:06.270 --> 19:08.521
Hey, Meg, you here for the
expired hot dogs?

19:08.556 --> 19:10.590
No, Carl, I'm
looking for Chris.

19:10.624 --> 19:12.559
I've looked everywhere
and I can't find him.

19:12.593 --> 19:15.061
Uh, I haven't seen him but
I'll keep an eye out.

19:16.397 --> 19:18.965
Hey, bozos, what do
you think of this?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.334
I did, I did it!

19:21.369 --> 19:22.602
You're crazy man.

19:22.636 --> 19:24.204
You're so crazy.

19:28.909 --> 19:31.011
I thought I told you
to clean up in here?

19:31.045 --> 19:32.545
And why aren't
you dressed?

19:32.580 --> 19:33.813
We're supposed
to have dinner

19:33.848 --> 19:35.415
with Judge
Maynard and Timmy.

19:35.449 --> 19:37.550
Yeah, okay, as soon
as I finish this level.

19:37.585 --> 19:38.952
No, get your coat on.

19:38.986 --> 19:41.321
It's a three-hour
drive to that cabin.

19:41.355 --> 19:43.089
Can't you just
cook something here?

19:43.124 --> 19:44.257
Excuse me?

19:44.291 --> 19:46.059
I am not going
to cook you dinner

19:46.093 --> 19:47.861
while you sit here
in your own mess

19:47.895 --> 19:49.362
playing your TV games.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.698
Oh-ho,
and the martyr returns.

19:51.732 --> 19:56.703
Chris, I... I think
it's time for you to go.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.104
Okay, I'll go.

19:58.139 --> 19:59.472
But I want you to know,

19:59.507 --> 20:01.541
I faked all
my light-headedness.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.043
Mm, good Kool-Aid.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.645
Whoa, whoa.

20:05.679 --> 20:06.980
Sound familiar?

20:10.134 --> 20:11.384
Oh, my God, Chris.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.585
Oh, there you are.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.154
I've been looking all
over for you.

20:14.188 --> 20:16.890
Why? You want to humiliate
me with more slave work?

20:16.924 --> 20:20.660
No, I...
I wanted to apologize.

20:20.694 --> 20:22.262
I should've never
blackmailed you.

20:22.296 --> 20:23.897
I'm really sorry.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.332
And I want you
to come home.

20:26.367 --> 20:28.201
I thought you said no
one would miss me?

20:28.235 --> 20:30.770
I said a lot of stupid
things I didn't mean, Chris.

20:30.805 --> 20:32.689
But I miss you.

20:32.723 --> 20:35.258
Thanks, Meg.
I miss you, too.

20:35.292 --> 20:37.193
You know,
living in that family,

20:37.228 --> 20:38.595
we both have
pretty crappy lives.

20:38.629 --> 20:40.096
And if we're
going to survive it,

20:40.131 --> 20:41.598
we can't turn on each other.

20:41.632 --> 20:43.166
We're all we have.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.400
I know.

20:44.435 --> 20:46.402
I'll never do anything
like that again.

20:46.437 --> 20:48.204
Do you think you can
ever forgive me?

20:48.239 --> 20:50.340
Yeah, I forgive you.
