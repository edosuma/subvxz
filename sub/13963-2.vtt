00:09.092 --> 00:11.261
- I got bagels.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.096
- What happened
to that girl?

00:13.096 --> 00:15.057
What happened
to those pants?

00:15.057 --> 00:17.226
- It's not the pants, honey.
It's your ass.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.894
You look good in anything.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.479
- You always say that.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.356
- I say it all the time
'cause it's true.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.192
- What are we doing, John?

00:25.192 --> 00:27.694
- I'm--I'm gonna make
some bagels, and--

00:27.694 --> 00:30.447
- This thing with Micki's
got ahold of me.

00:30.447 --> 00:34.284
I feel like my past
is haunting me.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.036
Look at that girl.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.037
[sighs]

00:37.037 --> 00:38.997
That girl was doing things.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.333
She had her whole life
ahead of her.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.960
She was adventurous
and bold,

00:42.960 --> 00:45.420
and now she's...

00:45.420 --> 00:47.756
living in a rented
Brooklyn apartment,

00:47.756 --> 00:50.300
not engaged, not married--

00:50.300 --> 00:52.177
just standing still.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.223
I think we need
a change, John.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.933
- What do you mean?

00:57.933 --> 00:59.893
- I don't know.
Something.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.395
- Something like what?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.771
- Something else.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.231
- Okay, honey, honey,
listen.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.984
Let's just--let's relax, okay?
All right?

01:06.984 --> 01:10.445
You know, we got dealt a double
mortality blow recently.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.613
You know, first David Bowie--

01:11.613 --> 01:12.990
that was a big thing
for both of us--

01:12.990 --> 01:14.741
and then Micki,
which was huge.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.369
Let's just--
let's not overreact, okay?

01:17.369 --> 01:19.037
I mean, you know,
I want you to be happy.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.039
I want us to be happy.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.291
Okay, you know what?

01:22.291 --> 01:23.584
You've asked me this
a million times

01:23.584 --> 01:26.670
and I always said no,
but do you--do you--

01:26.670 --> 01:28.046
you want to go
to couples counseling?

01:28.046 --> 01:29.172
- I want to have a threesome.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.215
- Oh!

01:30.215 --> 01:31.466
Way better idea.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.093
- That girl used to have
threesomes.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.469
We used to have threesomes.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.763
- Yes, we did.
You know what would be awesome?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.515
A threesome
with a couples counselor.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.309
- [laughs]
- That would be, like, amazing.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.185
Hey.
- What's up?

01:42.185 --> 01:43.437
- We're gonna have a threesome.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.896
- Okay, but I only got an hour.

01:44.896 --> 01:45.981
- [laughs]
- Ha-ha.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.274
- Whoever you get,

01:47.274 --> 01:48.692
if you plan
on bringing them here,

01:48.692 --> 01:49.943
I have an announcement.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.528
It is laundry day,

01:51.528 --> 01:53.405
and there's a serious
clean towel shortage.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.032
- You know who'd be good?

01:55.032 --> 01:57.409
That witchy blonde bartender
at the Mercury Lounge.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.910
- Oh, yeah, we love her.
She's hot.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.912
- Yeah, she's also,
like, 20.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.289
If I'm gonna be
doing this again,

02:02.289 --> 02:03.749
I don't want to feel bad
about myself.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.418
40 or over,
smaller tits, bigger ass.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.295
Just remember, if you ever
have a threesome,

02:08.295 --> 02:10.339
it's really all about
your own self-esteem.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.007
- Sometimes when I listen
to you guys talk,

02:12.007 --> 02:13.258
I feel like a nun.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.052
I have done nothing.
I don't go out.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.219
I don't party.
I don't do drugs.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.138
The one time
I almost did blow,

02:18.138 --> 02:20.557
I got so hung up on how much
I hated my eyebrows

02:20.557 --> 02:22.309
in the coke mirror
that I didn't even do it.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.602
- [chuckles]
- Seriously.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.228
I'm in the middle
of New York City

02:25.228 --> 02:27.064
in the rock scene, and all
I care about is the music.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.066
It's sad; I feel like
I'm missing out a little.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.359
- Because you are.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.985
This is gonna sound
like some Oprah shit,

02:31.985 --> 02:34.946
but I don't regret
the things I did.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.282
I only regret
the things I didn't do.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.326
So you got to have
a threesome

02:39.326 --> 02:41.787
or a lesbian affair
or something.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.623
- Okay, well, I feel like
threesome is my best option

02:44.623 --> 02:46.166
just 'cause if I get distracted
on my phone,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.626
there's someone there
to take over.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.835
- That's a great reason
to have a threesome.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.420
[laughter]
My God.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.839
Base your sexual experiences
on your ADD problem.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.257
- So what do you say, baby?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.676
Want to do it?
Want to have a threesome?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.511
- Well, if sex, drugs,
and rock and roll

02:57.511 --> 03:00.514
has taught me anything,
it's that I'm a one-woman guy.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.932
- Oh!
- Oh.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.642
- What he's really
trying to say is,

03:03.642 --> 03:04.976
he's a little gun-shy
when it comes to threesomes.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.019
You should just
tell her the truth.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.145
We're talking about it.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.355
- There's no shame in it,
Flash.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.398
- There is a dollop of shame.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.774
- No, it's endearing.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.442
- With a side order
of embarrassment.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.695
- Shut up.
It was a complication situation.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.279
- When we were teenagers,
we picked up

03:16.279 --> 03:17.739
this girl who was
the lead singer in some band.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.366
I can't remember the name.
She was hot.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.118
And we brought her back
to the apartment that we had,

03:21.118 --> 03:22.994
and, um, let's put it this way--

03:22.994 --> 03:25.664
she was all mine after
the first... seven seconds?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.165
- Ten. Ten seconds, man.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.542
- Oh, oh, that's better.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.293
- She was very hot.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.545
I'm retired from group sex,

03:31.545 --> 03:32.796
but if you want me to,

03:32.796 --> 03:33.964
I'll give it one more try.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.882
- Oh, that's very sweet.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.801
But if you can't perform,
let's face the facts:

03:37.801 --> 03:39.845
I'm basically having
a lesbian fling, right?

03:39.845 --> 03:41.138
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.431
So let's go get me
a lesbian.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.557
- Yee-haw.
- That sounded--

03:43.557 --> 03:44.808
I'm--I'm very excited.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.309
I'm just--I just need coffee.

You have names, ages,
multiple photos of each girl.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.861

from Pam Stone?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.070

04:39.070 --> 04:40.572

04:40.572 --> 04:42.282
- Yeah, she swings both ways.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.950
We're also after the old
bass player from Vag Halen.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.535
I used to have
a thing for her,

04:45.535 --> 04:47.078
and I'm pretty sure
she had a thing for me.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.955
- Aw. Honey, I hate
to break it to you,

04:48.955 --> 04:51.041
but I am the main attraction
for these women.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.584

04:54.252 --> 04:56.213

I shall massage away.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.339

04:57.339 --> 04:59.174

Pam said yes.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.675

- Yes!

05:00.675 --> 05:01.927
She was my first choice.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.513
Oh, so athletic.
Mm!

05:04.513 --> 05:06.223
Remind me to stretch
before we do her.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.016

black lesbian.

of your body,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.753
she ain't gonna be thinking
about your face.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.708
Sex with another chick,
it is awesome.

06:56.708 --> 07:01.254
Two girls together,
the sex just goes on and on,

07:01.254 --> 07:03.506
wave after orgasmic wave.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.966
Mm!
[clicks tongue]

07:04.966 --> 07:06.343
[inhales sharply]

07:06.343 --> 07:08.386
[sighs]
There's no natural ending.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.804
- Well, then how do you know
when it's over?

07:09.804 --> 07:11.473
- Eventually somebody
gets hungry.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.682
Usually me.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.684
Two hours in,
order a pizza.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.935
Very satisfying.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.688
- Did--did you say two hours?

07:24.402 --> 07:25.904
- ♪ 'Cause you're a liar ♪

07:25.904 --> 07:28.907
♪ You're a liar ♪

07:28.907 --> 07:32.118

07:34.621 --> 07:36.915

07:36.915 --> 07:39.084

07:39.084 --> 07:41.127

07:43.713 --> 07:46.758
- Holy shit,
she just clocked you.

07:46.758 --> 07:47.842
- [chuckles]

07:47.842 --> 07:50.762
Why did I just wave?

07:50.762 --> 07:52.847
Why is my hand still up?

07:52.847 --> 07:55.141
- ♪ All you do is lie ♪

07:55.141 --> 07:57.227

07:57.227 --> 08:05.360

08:06.820 --> 08:08.488
- Hi, I'm Davvy.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.614
- Oh, h--
Hey.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.199
I'm--I'm--I'm Gigi.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.952
- Did you wave at me
when I winked at you onstage?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.662
- Uh, yes, I-I did.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.249
I waved because I'm
the uncoolest person on Earth.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.626
But I should be cooler 'cause
I'm actually a singer too.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.044
- Yeah, I've seen you perform.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.379
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.588
Your voice is incredible.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.840
As are your eyes.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.509
- Oh. Thank you.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.845
- I'm trying this thing
where I don't resent people

08:31.845 --> 08:33.680
for being talented
or beautiful.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.806
- Mm-hmm.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.975
- And you're both, so...

08:36.975 --> 08:39.227
I'm gonna have to work
twice as hard not to hate you.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.105
- No, I'm not even anything.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.441
What you did onstage
was just--it was--

08:44.441 --> 08:45.900
it was amazing.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.235
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.486
- Glad you liked it.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.739
- I did.
Liked it.

08:51.906 --> 08:52.949
Oh, no, these aren't all mine.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.075
These are for my band.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.326
- Okay.
Well, I'm not judging.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.287
I like a girl who makes
bad decisions.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.955
[both laugh]

08:58.955 --> 09:02.250
So, um, you hanging,
or you got to split?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.626
- Oh, I'm hanging.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.711
I'm gonna hang--
I'm gonna hang out.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.837
- I think you should hang.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.130
- Yes.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.631
- Let me just get changed up.
- Sure.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.550
- And we'll grab a drink.
- Okay.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.260
- Or 4... or 12.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.887
- Oh, no.
I mean--

09:16.306 --> 09:17.515
- Oh, hey.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.850
You don't bone her,
I will.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.477
Sorry, Pam.
- No, I'm with you.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.228
Let's ditch Johnny
and have a threesome with her.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.855
- I get to watch.
- Good luck, honey.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.440
I'll be at home.
Call me if you need anything.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.192
- Okay.
- I'm so excited for you.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.443
- This is weird.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.278
- Just remember, pizza.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.906
- Yeah, we're a long way
from pizza.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.948
[sighs]
How do I look?

09:33.948 --> 09:35.200
- Nervous.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.577
Here, take this
and relax.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.290
Ah.
Better?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.876
Whoa!

09:44.876 --> 09:46.586
- Do you guys know
the difference

09:46.586 --> 09:48.671
between your
former manager, Ira,

09:48.671 --> 09:51.216
and your present
and future manager, <i>moi?</i>

09:51.216 --> 09:52.967
- You're a taller
self-hating Jew.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.511
- Ha-ha.
That's really funny.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.512
No, I'm not.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.554
I'm the new Jew, okay?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.014
I come with new ideas.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.140
- Go ahead.
What do you got?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.683
- Okay, the success

10:00.683 --> 10:02.811
of the hip-hop musical
"Hamilton"

10:02.811 --> 10:06.731
has led to an upsurge
in people bringing historical

10:06.731 --> 10:09.192
but edgy material
to the New York theater scene.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.111
So I did some talking.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.988
I met with some of the more
influential friends I have.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.242
I played them a couple songs
from "An Gorta Mor,"

10:17.242 --> 10:19.119
and they want to bring the show,

10:19.119 --> 10:22.038
with a major Irish actor
starring,

10:22.038 --> 10:26.459
to the hottest experimental
theater venue in the city.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.044
Boom.

10:28.044 --> 10:32.882
Brooklyn Opera and Off-Broadway
Main Stage.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.717
- Oh, my God, someone gets me.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.594
- Are you interested?
- Interested?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.221
I am in!
- All right!

10:38.221 --> 10:40.056
- I'm in, baby!
- Good!

10:40.056 --> 10:41.391
Right.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.518
- Boom.
- Boom, bing-bong-bong.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.854
- Bow-bow-bow. All right.
This is awesome.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.230
The producer just wants
to sit down

10:47.230 --> 10:48.356
with you guys
for a couple minutes.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.941
- I'm out.
- Go over--

10:49.941 --> 10:51.317
What?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.610
- I produce.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.903
I direct.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.281
I-I control everything, man.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.241
We do it my way,

10:58.241 --> 10:59.742
or we don't do it
at all.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.162
- Okay, so they're never
gonna go for that

11:02.162 --> 11:04.581
because these are actual
notable people

11:04.581 --> 11:06.457
that have huge, big-time
Broadway credits.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.501
- You hear that?
"They." Huh?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.170
- They want to have
a conversation

11:10.170 --> 11:12.088
about what parts
of "An Gorta Mor"

11:12.088 --> 11:13.548
actually work onstage.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.674
It's a process, man.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.342
- What about my process, Noah?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.886
I've spent eight years
of my life,

11:17.886 --> 11:20.221
every dime I've ever had
creating a song cycle

11:20.221 --> 11:23.016
about one of the great tragedies
of human history.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.268
This is my blood, man,
my sweat,

11:25.268 --> 11:26.644
my tears.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.938
- It is 26 songs
about potatoes!

11:28.938 --> 11:31.691
- It's 29 songs
about pain, oppression,

11:31.691 --> 11:33.693
famine, and suffering.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.904
- 6 million Jews died
in the Holocaust!

11:35.904 --> 11:37.864
- Jesus. Wow.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.365
- Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.491
I don't--um--

11:40.491 --> 11:42.202
I don't even--okay, uh...

11:42.202 --> 11:44.120
So sometimes when I get
really worked up, I say that.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.372
It's kind of like, um--
like a Jewish Tourette's thing.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.832
I'm sorry.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.083
Say what you were saying

11:49.083 --> 11:50.543
about, uh, your pain
and blood, man.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.675
[both laughing]

11:57.675 --> 11:59.677
- You have so much confidence
onstage, you know?

11:59.677 --> 12:01.137
You're so in the moment.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.181
I'm just--
I wish I had that.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.517
- You hate the way you look,
don't you?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.436
- Oh, we're going there
right now?

12:08.436 --> 12:09.520
- Yeah.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.981
- Uh... well, yeah.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.524
I do sometimes.
Yeah.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.901
- Tell me what you hate.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.277
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.445
Come on.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.197
We're just two ladies talking.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.365
- [sighs]

12:20.365 --> 12:23.368
Well, my butt is too high.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.661
- Absolutely not.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.287
- No?
- It is perfectly placed.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.665
- Um...

12:28.665 --> 12:30.083
my tits are enormous.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.167
- Yeah!

12:31.167 --> 12:32.585
[both laugh]

12:32.585 --> 12:35.421
- Oh, my God,
you're relentlessly positive.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.507
- Yup.
I'm a queer woman of color.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.716
Every day
is a Disney cruise.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.926
- No, that's not
what I meant.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.678
- I know. Look.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.596
I'm a woman, okay?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.848
Some days, I wake up,
and I hate my hair

12:45.848 --> 12:48.268
and I wish I had a face
like yours

12:48.268 --> 12:49.852
and a rich-ass girlfriend
so I didn't have

12:49.852 --> 12:51.521
to lift a finger
for the rest of my life.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.065
But most days?

12:54.065 --> 12:57.527
Most days, I wake up,
and I say,

12:57.527 --> 12:58.820
"I am the queen
of Pussy Castle,

12:58.820 --> 13:00.405
and I will destroy
all my enemies."

13:00.405 --> 13:01.990
- [laughs]
- 'Cause that's my motto.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.075
- That's awesome.
That's a good motto.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.868
- I'm glad you like it.
- I wish I had a motto.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.328
- Well, we can--
we can find you a motto.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.538
- Yeah?

13:08.538 --> 13:09.872
- Or at least a nickname
of sorts.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.082
- What would my nickname be?

13:11.082 --> 13:14.127
- Um, how about...
Bitch Tits?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.379
[both laugh]

13:16.379 --> 13:17.672
Why are you hiding
your smile?

13:17.672 --> 13:19.716
- Oh, no!
- Yeah, I saw it.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.677
- Oh, because when I smile,
I look like a chipmunk.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.345
- Jesus! You are a mess!

13:24.345 --> 13:27.223
- I know!
[sighs]

13:27.223 --> 13:28.933
Yeah, but you know what?
I-I'm happy.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.601
I thought you were gonna
think I was just another

13:30.601 --> 13:32.186
stupid straight girl
who had a crush on you.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.229
- I do.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.731
- You do?
- Yeah.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.316
- Well, aren't you mad
that you're just

13:36.316 --> 13:38.901
kind of like an object
of sexual curiosity?

13:38.901 --> 13:41.571
- I mean, yeah,
I'm slightly insulted.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.489
- You are?
- Yeah.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.992
But, uh, I don't know.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.827
With a body like yours,
I can be very forgiving.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.204
- [chuckles]

13:50.204 --> 13:51.789
- I say we get
a shit-ton of margaritas

13:51.789 --> 13:52.999
and see where it goes.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.000
- Yeah?
- BT.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.209
- BT?
- BT.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.252
- What is that?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.253
- Bitch Tits.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.421
- Oh, right!

13:58.421 --> 14:00.089
Bitch Tits.
I really like that.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.340
- I'm glad.
It's your nickname.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.925
- Good.
- [laughs]

14:02.925 --> 14:04.594
- I'm an artist.
I'm ahead of my time.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.720
I'm out.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.346
You hear me?

14:07.346 --> 14:08.973
I am out.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.601
- Hab, can I say something

14:11.601 --> 14:14.771
as your best and only friend?

14:16.564 --> 14:18.191
You know who you're
acting like right now?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.193
- David Bowie?
- No.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.070
- Thom Yorke?
- No.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.488
- Are you talking
about my attitude

14:23.488 --> 14:25.031
or just, like,
the timbre of my voice?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.949
- Johnny Rock, asshole.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.660
You're acting
like Johnny Rock.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.288
"Ah, screw the world.
Screw the industry.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.582
Screw the new Jew."

14:34.582 --> 14:36.125
Sorry.
- It's okay.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.920
- "Screw everybody.
Everybody's against me."

14:38.920 --> 14:40.505
[whining]

14:40.505 --> 14:42.632
- Noah, tell him. Tell him.
- "Genius."

14:42.632 --> 14:44.425
- I don't sound
like Johnny Rock, do I?

14:44.425 --> 14:46.302
- Um...

14:46.302 --> 14:47.637
you know, what--

14:47.637 --> 14:49.555
