Next question on
the driver's ed test.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.216
"If you arrive at
a traffic signal that's
flashing red, you should..."

00:15.216 --> 00:17.718
Get out and start
an intersection
dance party?

00:17.718 --> 00:20.051

00:21.292 --> 00:22.553
BOTH: Ooh! Ooh!

00:22.553 --> 00:23.894

00:23.894 --> 00:26.227
I think I just realized
why it takes us
so long to study.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.930
Now come on, Cyd.
The test is tomorrow.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.902
Our first step
to getting our licenses.

00:31.902 --> 00:33.534
Soon, we'll be
able to drive.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.005
What's so great
about driving?

00:35.005 --> 00:37.238
Are you kidding?
We'll finally be free.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.210
"Free" is just short
for "freedom."

00:39.210 --> 00:41.372
The second half
of that is "dumb."

00:41.372 --> 00:42.873
I rest my case.

00:42.873 --> 00:45.846
Did you just make
an airtight argument
against freedom?

00:45.846 --> 00:47.918
You're smart in
ways that disturb me.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.222
But I don't get it.

00:51.222 --> 00:54.085
Everyone in our class
is dying to get their license.

00:54.085 --> 00:56.056
Why aren't you?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.758
What do we need
to drive for, Shelby?
We have a chauffeur.

00:57.758 --> 00:58.889
You mean my mom?

00:58.889 --> 01:02.032
That's the chauffeur
I'm talkin' about.

01:02.032 --> 01:04.834
She's also our therapist,
private chef and maid.

01:04.834 --> 01:06.497
Should we
appreciate her more?

01:07.768 --> 01:10.070
BOTH: Eh.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.244
Come on, there must
be other things you'd
rather do than study.

01:13.244 --> 01:17.108
Oh, I know. We could go
back and relive the day we
met in kindergarten.

01:17.108 --> 01:20.651
Are you trying to manipulate
me by playing on my love
for our friendship?

01:20.651 --> 01:22.953
'Cause it's totally working!
(CHUCKLES)

01:22.953 --> 01:23.984
We'll study when
we get back!

01:23.984 --> 01:25.386
I did not say that!

gave us trophies for
practically anything?

I got a trophy

I got a trophy for keeping
my finger out of my nose.

01:58.389 --> 02:00.251
Yeah, uh, Cyd?
About that...

02:00.721 --> 02:01.722
Dang it!

I did not know.

03:20.831 --> 03:23.734
Okay, remember
what we're here for.
Let's relive how we met.

03:23.734 --> 03:26.637
I believe I was sitting
at this table eating lunch.

03:26.637 --> 03:28.939
And I had just returned
from the nurse's office

03:28.939 --> 03:31.942
with my third pair
of loaner pants.

03:31.942 --> 03:33.584
Which I believe
was a class record. So...

03:35.085 --> 03:37.588

moment happened.

bologna in my cheese sandwich.

did back then.

more we could do.

04:11.322 --> 04:13.554
Snacks. Naptime.
Chasing boys.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.255

Oh, Cyd, you got

05:03.704 --> 05:07.207
You'd think you wouldn't get
a trophy for being able to
hold a bunch of trophies,

05:07.207 --> 05:10.180
but it's in here
somewhere.

05:10.180 --> 05:13.814
All right, come on, let's jump
back so we can study for
the Driver's Ed test.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.386
We don't need
Driver's Ed.

05:15.386 --> 05:17.888
Look! Who needs real cars
when we have these?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.651
We're livin' the dream!

05:20.651 --> 05:21.922
Whoo-hoo!

05:25.726 --> 05:28.359
Ugh, this driving simulator
is so stressful.

05:28.359 --> 05:32.162
There's some speed demon
behind me who won't stop
riding my bumper.

05:32.162 --> 05:33.604
You think you've
got problems?

05:33.604 --> 05:36.036
I've got some old lady
in front of me that
won't let me go by.

05:38.509 --> 05:39.870
BOTH: Ahh.

05:41.311 --> 05:42.443
Speed demon.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.544
Old lady.

05:44.815 --> 05:46.577
(BOTH GROANING)

05:46.577 --> 05:48.579
What happened to you two?

05:48.579 --> 05:52.152
We went back
to kindergarten and raged!

05:53.554 --> 05:56.557
Never mix juice boxes
with juice pouches.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.088
There's a reason they say,

05:58.088 --> 06:01.131
"Box before pouch,
wake up on the couch."

06:02.563 --> 06:04.334
You went back
to kindergarten?

06:04.334 --> 06:05.536
Shh...

06:07.438 --> 06:09.900
I got a bad case of cooties
in kindergarten.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.773
You think it can never happen
to you, but it can.

06:14.505 --> 06:17.778
Hope you enjoyed
a little extra practice
on the simulators.

06:17.778 --> 06:21.011
Sorry about the delay
in getting your
driver's ed tests.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.514
Someone tried to slice
deli meat on the copy machine.

06:23.514 --> 06:26.356
So the first page of this test
was on roast beef.

06:29.219 --> 06:30.320
Okay, then.

06:32.523 --> 06:35.526
Shelby? What happened to you?
You look like you did
when you were 13.

06:35.526 --> 06:37.868
What are you
talking about?

06:37.868 --> 06:40.601
Shelby, you have
braces and glasses!

06:40.601 --> 06:42.833
Agh! My awkward phase!

06:42.833 --> 06:45.275
Cyd, I like what you did
with your hair.

06:45.275 --> 06:46.977
Girls appreciate
when you notice.

06:46.977 --> 06:48.439
What happened to my hair?

06:48.439 --> 06:49.810
(SOFTLY)
And sometimes they don't.

06:51.782 --> 06:53.413
BOTH: We're thirteen!

06:53.413 --> 06:54.945
(SCREAMING)

06:58.919 --> 07:01.692
Why do the girls look
and act like they're 13?

07:01.692 --> 07:04.254
Do you think it has something
to do with you jumping
back to kindergarten?

07:04.254 --> 07:08.599
Duh-durr. It's
totally terrifying. Uh-doy.

07:08.599 --> 07:11.662
Now they're back in that
irritating Valley Girl phase
they went through.

07:11.662 --> 07:16.537
I am so nervous I'm totally
brewing a zit right in the
middle of my forehead.

07:16.537 --> 07:20.671
Ew, don't look
at it, zit-lover.

07:20.671 --> 07:23.173
So, do you guys, like,
know what's happening
to us, or what?

07:23.173 --> 07:24.945
Yeah, like what's
even going on?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.447
Like I don't care,
but I have to know.

07:28.979 --> 07:30.651
The nearest I can figure,

07:30.651 --> 07:32.723
traveling back to kindergarten
triggered something
in your cells.

07:32.723 --> 07:34.855
It appears as though
your brains and bodies
have regressed

07:34.855 --> 07:37.057
two full years from
your 15-year-old selves.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.089
Um, Barry.
One second, Renaldo.

07:39.089 --> 07:41.992
Now, of course,
this could all just be wild
speculation on my part. But...

07:41.992 --> 07:44.665
Um, Barry. I think
they got younger.

07:45.435 --> 07:46.997
Oh, shuds!

07:47.768 --> 07:49.239
Stop staring at us.

07:49.239 --> 07:50.841
Yeah, don't be icky!

08:01.612 --> 08:04.414
The girls were 15,
then they were 13,
and now they're nine!

08:04.414 --> 08:06.416
Why is this happening?

08:06.416 --> 08:09.359
Well, this is the only time
the girls have traveled back
to when they were so small.

08:09.359 --> 08:12.593
Maybe now their minds
and bodies are struggling
to regain equilibrium.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.924
That's got to be it.

08:13.924 --> 08:15.766
And you know what
we're gonna do to fix it?

08:15.766 --> 08:16.997
No, what?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.729
No, I was asking you.
I have no idea!

08:20.500 --> 08:23.203
All we know is it happened
when they went back
to kindergarten.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.536
We don't know how much
younger they could get.

08:25.536 --> 08:28.378
They may de-age themselves
out of existence.

08:28.378 --> 08:30.280
Barry, you have to help us.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.542
I'm scared.

08:31.542 --> 08:34.083
Girls, I know how
to fix this.

08:34.083 --> 08:35.916
Renaldo, I just lied
to the girls.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.249
Look, there's no
science class right now.

08:39.249 --> 08:42.422
I'm going to run to the lab
and use the microscope
to figure this out.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.794
I'll just need a cell sample.

08:45.195 --> 08:46.927
Ow! My hair!

08:46.927 --> 08:49.930
Don't even think
about it, bub.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.302
If you give him
one of your hairs,
you can take one of Barry's.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.706
Ow! Renaldo!
Why'd you promise that?

08:55.706 --> 08:57.337
You know
I'm a tender scalp.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.641
Why do you think my mom has
to mouth-dry my hair
by sighing gently upon it?

09:03.473 --> 09:05.816
You keep an eye
on the girls and just
stay out of sight.

09:05.816 --> 09:07.618
We don't have much time.

09:07.618 --> 09:09.650
I'll be back as soon as
I can analyze these hairs.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.625
Ow! What was that for?

09:14.625 --> 09:16.356
I know how much you hate
feeling left out.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.158
I do hate
feeling left out.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.329
You're the best, Barry!

09:25.065 --> 09:27.638
Mr. Doyle, excuse me.
I need to use the microscope.

09:27.638 --> 09:29.099
Barry, this isn't a good time.

09:29.099 --> 09:30.971
I'm right in the middle of
preparing the crash test dummy

09:30.971 --> 09:32.342
for the next
Driver's Ed class.

09:32.342 --> 09:34.144
Mr. Doyle, it's an emergency.
Barry.

09:34.144 --> 09:35.145
Not now.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.278
(SIGHS)

09:38.278 --> 09:41.081
(SIGHS) So sorry
about that, Gloria.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.452
Where were we?

09:44.655 --> 09:47.487
I hope you like pasta.
I just guessed.

09:53.023 --> 09:54.725
As I was saying,

09:54.725 --> 09:57.327
everybody thinks that
I'm just Dishy Doyle

09:57.327 --> 09:59.429
with all the hot gossip.

09:59.429 --> 10:03.033
But you know why I talk about
all the stuff out here?

10:03.033 --> 10:06.276
Because I'm afraid to talk
about all the stuff in here.

10:11.141 --> 10:14.014
Don't worry.
Barry will be back soon
and you're going to be fine.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.646
What's wrong with us?

10:15.646 --> 10:17.818
Oh good. You've forgotten
the fact that you're
aging backwards.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.851
BOTH:
We're aging backwards?

10:20.851 --> 10:23.393
But everything will be fine!
What's going to be fine?

10:23.393 --> 10:25.325
Oh good, you forgot again.
Forgot what?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.356
That you're aging backwards.

10:26.356 --> 10:27.898
BOTH: We're aging backwards?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.231
No...

10:33.633 --> 10:37.307
I don't usually dance
in front of people, Gloria,

10:37.307 --> 10:39.339
but you make
me feel so safe.

10:53.523 --> 10:57.858
You know in some
cultures, when a man
dances with a woman,

10:57.858 --> 10:59.559
they're engaged.

10:59.559 --> 11:03.563
Those cultures aren't actually
real, but neither are you.
(CHUCKLES)

11:05.265 --> 11:08.368
That's right, Gloria,
we can make our own rules.

11:11.702 --> 11:12.973
This is so weird.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.745
At this age, you guys
would be in fourth grade.

11:14.745 --> 11:18.048
Cyd, remember that boy
you totally had a crush on
in the fourth grade?

11:18.048 --> 11:20.050
What are you guys
talking about?
Shush!

11:21.551 --> 11:23.253
You were so
in love with him.

11:23.253 --> 11:25.685
Every time he would talk
to you, you would shush him
and punch him in the arm.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.387
Punch who in the arm?
Shush!

11:28.588 --> 11:30.220
He always wore hats.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.591
We called him
Hat Boy.

11:31.591 --> 11:34.224
Wait a minute.
I wear hats.

11:34.224 --> 11:35.766
Could you introduce me
to Hat Boy?

11:35.766 --> 11:37.097
I think we'd have
a lot in common.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.328
Shush!

11:41.271 --> 11:42.532
(LOUD THUD)

11:45.375 --> 11:47.878
Did you find a good
hiding spot, Gloria?

11:47.878 --> 11:50.981
I'm gonna count to 10
and then I'm gonna find you!

11:52.512 --> 11:56.286
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

11:56.286 --> 11:58.949
Oh, who can wait?
Ready or not, here I come!

12:02.793 --> 12:05.655
Ah! Okay, Gloria,
now you find me!

12:08.328 --> 12:11.631
See, Gertrude is a tough
19th century girl

12:11.631 --> 12:14.634
who had a hardscrabble
upbringing in
the Yukon Gold Rush.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.767
Katherine is
the milliner's daughter.

12:18.809 --> 12:21.842
How do you know so much
about the National Girl
Dolls collection?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.775
Uh...

12:24.775 --> 12:27.647
Oh, look, here comes Barry.
Let's listen to what
he has to say.

12:29.619 --> 12:33.453
Renaldo, I've analyzed
the hair cells and I have
good news and bad news.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.725
If we don't get the girls back
in the next couple of hours,

12:35.725 --> 12:37.988
they may never return
to their normal selves.

12:37.988 --> 12:40.130
Just like frontier girl Mabel
when she moved to the city

12:40.130 --> 12:42.062
and never went back
to the farm again.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.964
Are you talking about
National Girl Dolls?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.566
So, how about that good news?

12:48.368 --> 12:49.940
I think I know how to fix it.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.102
I tried multiple chemicals
and minerals,

12:52.102 --> 12:54.744
but when I added calcium,
the cells repaired
themselves!

12:54.744 --> 12:58.108
That's great! It sure
is lucky that you went
into that lab, Barry.

12:58.108 --> 12:59.950
Lucky for the girls,
Renaldo.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.252
But I paid a price
for going in that lab.

13:02.252 --> 13:04.054
I saw things.

13:04.054 --> 13:05.355
Non-science things.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.559
Um, Barry?

13:09.559 --> 13:11.191
Oh, don't say that.
The last time you said that,
they turned nine.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.023
So what should I say
if they turned five?

13:13.023 --> 13:14.064
They turned five?

13:15.325 --> 13:17.828
Oh, that's good, that's good.
Let me try.

13:17.828 --> 13:19.199
They turned five?

13:21.071 --> 13:23.433
I want to watch
a Cuddle Bunny cartoon!

13:23.433 --> 13:25.335
Hey mister,
got any bologna?

13:27.277 --> 13:30.540
We need lots of calcium,
and calcium is in milk.

13:30.540 --> 13:33.183
Girls, Renaldo and I
are going to get you milk.

13:33.183 --> 13:35.916
We don't have much time.
We're gonna need to ask people
to give us milk.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.017
Let's split up.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.019
BOTH: I'll get the milk,
you watch the girls.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.821
Okay, I'll watch
the girls, you get milk.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.253
Great! Got it.

13:43.253 --> 13:44.895
Do we?
I think so.

14:12.382 --> 14:13.783
Renaldo! I got one.

14:13.783 --> 14:15.055
That's great, Barry!

14:16.756 --> 14:18.328
How did you get
so much milk?

14:18.328 --> 14:19.829
It's easy. I just said,

14:19.829 --> 14:21.932
"Hi, I'm Naldo.
Can I have some milk?"

14:25.165 --> 14:26.696
Wait.
Where are the girls?

14:26.696 --> 14:28.468
You're not supposed
to be here.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.241
Don't worry, I'll take you
to the principal's office.

14:31.241 --> 14:34.044
Hey, here's something
my nieces like.

14:41.411 --> 14:42.412
Okay, then.

14:44.654 --> 14:46.786
Now we have to break the girls
out of the principal's office.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.118
This is terrible.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.620
If we can't fix them soon,
we may lose them forever!

14:57.998 --> 15:00.770
We have to break the girls out
of the principal's office
to give them milk

15:00.770 --> 15:03.133
so they don't de-age
themselves out of existence.

15:03.133 --> 15:06.506
Don't worry, Barry,
I have a plan.
It's bold, it's daring,

15:06.506 --> 15:08.478
it's the most brilliant thing
I've ever thought of.

15:08.478 --> 15:12.312
First, we get a chimp,
a tractor trailer
and 300 feet of spaghetti.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.343
I also have a plan.

15:13.343 --> 15:14.484
Let's go with that one.

15:15.986 --> 15:17.487
Here's how
we're going to do it...

15:17.487 --> 15:19.319
I'll make my way into
 the principal's outer office

15:19.319 --> 15:22.022
and charm his secretary
 with a clever joke.

15:22.022 --> 15:25.525
Hi, Mrs. Grimbleshaw,
I found this dummy
outside in the hallway.

15:25.525 --> 15:30.260
He must have been
cutting class 'cause he didn't
study for his "crash test."

15:30.260 --> 15:33.133
Okay, Mrs. Grimbleshaw,
but I'm gonna get you to laugh
before I graduate.

15:34.864 --> 15:37.137
BARRY: Then it's up to you
 to sneak into the office.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.139
NALDO: How do I get in
 without her me noticing?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.640
BARRY: That's the clever part.

15:44.314 --> 15:47.317
With the principal in
the bathroom, you'll have two
minutes to get into his office

15:47.317 --> 15:50.020
and get the girls
 out before anyone realizes
 what's going on.

16:08.938 --> 16:10.470
(DOOR CREAKS)

16:29.959 --> 16:32.462
Mrs. Grimbleshaw,
have you seen...

16:32.462 --> 16:35.725
There it is! Gloria!

16:35.725 --> 16:37.727
There you are!

16:37.727 --> 16:39.629
You are some good hider!

16:41.401 --> 16:42.832
Thanks, Mr. Doyle!
(SCREAMS)

16:47.677 --> 16:49.579
BARRY: At which point
 I'll rush in and
 grab the girls,

16:49.579 --> 16:51.241
just like I planned
 all along.

16:55.885 --> 16:58.588
C'mon, Renaldo,
we've no time for your
shenanigans. Let's go.

17:06.455 --> 17:07.896
Okay, we got you
out of school.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.858
Now you just need
to drink a lot of milk,

17:09.858 --> 17:12.102
and hopefully, it'll get you
back to your correct ages.

17:12.102 --> 17:14.404
I don't wanna.
I hate milk.

17:14.404 --> 17:15.835
Come on, girls,
drink your milk.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.338
Okay, Uncle Naldo.
I love milk.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.310
I hope this works.

17:21.310 --> 17:22.742
I want juice now.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.075
No, no, no. Milk.
You have to drink milk.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.416
Milk comes from a cow.
It's like cow juice.

17:27.416 --> 17:29.279
Milk comes from a cow?

17:29.279 --> 17:30.950
Ew. Cows are yucky.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.353
Cows are yucky,
but you know
what's not yucky?

17:33.353 --> 17:34.854
Chocolate cows!

17:34.854 --> 17:36.186
BOTH: Yay!

17:40.630 --> 17:42.292
It's not working.

17:42.292 --> 17:45.095
I really thought
I had the answer.
I thought I could help them.

17:45.095 --> 17:47.097
I don't know
what I'm gonna do now.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.199
Guys. It worked!

17:49.199 --> 17:51.000
Oh, thank goodness.
You're back!

17:51.000 --> 17:53.072
We were afraid
we were going to lose you.

17:53.703 --> 17:56.045
Wait, where's Cyd?

17:56.045 --> 17:57.277
I'm right here.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.011
Barry, why is
Cyd still five?

18:02.011 --> 18:04.013
I don't get it.
Why didn't Cyd get bigger?

18:04.013 --> 18:06.556
You both underwent the same
transformation when you got
back from kindergarten,

18:06.556 --> 18:09.419
you both drank the milk,
what variable are we missing?

18:09.419 --> 18:11.591
Could there be some
psychological component?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.524
Where'd Cyd go?

18:14.524 --> 18:16.226
Cyd!
Cyd?

18:16.226 --> 18:17.297
Cyd.

18:21.331 --> 18:24.674
Oh, thank goodness.
There you are.

18:24.674 --> 18:27.277
We've been looking
everywhere for you, Cyd.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.479
We need to get you back
to Barry before it's too late.

18:29.479 --> 18:32.212
We've gotta get
you back to 15.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.613
I don't wanna be big.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.685
(SCOFFS) You don't want
to be five years old forever.

18:39.589 --> 18:42.592
You want to be
five years old forever.

18:42.592 --> 18:44.624
That's why the milk
didn't work on you.

18:45.395 --> 18:47.357
You want to stay like this.

18:48.097 --> 18:49.599
But why?

18:49.599 --> 18:51.030
I'm scared.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.232
Of what?

18:54.033 --> 18:55.335
Growing up.

18:59.169 --> 19:00.510
I get it.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.413
It's scary.

19:03.413 --> 19:05.245
But you know what?

19:05.245 --> 19:09.179
There have always been
scary things about growing up.

19:09.179 --> 19:11.751
The first day of
school was scary.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.123
Learning to swim
was scary.

19:14.123 --> 19:16.426
The magician at my
sixth birthday was scary.

19:16.426 --> 19:18.588
There was a dead rabbit
in his hat.

19:18.588 --> 19:20.260
And there wasn't
supposed to be.

19:21.931 --> 19:24.494
You know how we got
through those things?

19:25.295 --> 19:27.096
Together.

19:27.096 --> 19:31.000
Whatever's scaring you
now, Cyd, we will get
through it together.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.472
Just like we always do.

19:38.808 --> 19:40.910
Cyd, you're back!

19:40.910 --> 19:42.782
Are you okay?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.584
I guess.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.986
What happened with you?

19:46.986 --> 19:50.590
I'm afraid to get my
driver's license.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.292
That's what
started this?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.423
The driver's
ed test?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.996
It just freaked me out.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.230
Driving is so grown up.
And that's only the beginning.

20:00.970 --> 20:02.732
First we're driving,

20:02.732 --> 20:04.404
then it's college,

20:04.404 --> 20:06.406
then it's jobs.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.177
It's all coming so fast.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.743
But then we went
back to kindergarten,
and it all stopped.

20:13.743 --> 20:17.116
When you said you wanted
to stay there forever,
I didn't think you meant it.

20:18.548 --> 20:20.790
Everything was just
so easy again.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.622
I totally get it.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.094
But you're not
growing up alone, Cyd.

20:25.094 --> 20:27.297
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

20:27.997 --> 20:29.859
Just like always.

20:29.859 --> 20:31.130
Thanks, Shelby.

20:31.701 --> 20:33.032
Of course.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.738
What do you say?
One more spin in the kiddie
car for old time's sake?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.039
Let's do this.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.912
Livin' the dream!

20:46.946 --> 20:48.918
Thank you
so much, Barry.

20:48.918 --> 20:51.951
We really got ourselves
into a lot of
trouble with time travel,

20:51.951 --> 20:54.524
but as usual,
you saved us.

20:54.524 --> 20:57.757
Well, what can I say,
but yes, I did.
(CHUCKLES)

20:58.488 --> 21:00.590
Yes, thank you, Barry.

21:00.590 --> 21:01.891
Thank you so much.

21:03.162 --> 21:06.366
BOTH: Thank you, Barry.
Thank you, Barry.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.639
ALL: Thank you, Barry.

21:09.639 --> 21:11.341
Thank you, Barry.

21:11.341 --> 21:12.972
Thank you, Barry.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.644
Thank you, Barry.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.306
Thank you, Barry.

21:16.306 --> 21:17.977
Thank you, Barry.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.549
Thank you, Barry.

21:19.549 --> 21:21.311
Thank you...
(GASPS)

21:21.311 --> 21:24.113
Oh, thank goodness
it was just a dream.

21:24.113 --> 21:26.115
Renaldo, you'll never believe
the dream I just had.

21:26.115 --> 21:28.318
Cyd and Shelby
were there with their
9-year-old selves

21:28.318 --> 21:29.889
and their
5-year-old selves.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.991
It was a time
paradox nightmare.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.764
Aww, that ruins
my surprise.

21:34.764 --> 21:35.925
ALL: Aww...

21:38.267 --> 21:39.969
(GASPS)

21:39.969 --> 21:43.773
Aw, man, Barry's dream spoiled
my dream's surprise.
