WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:03.920
Good afternoon, Eleanor.
What can I get you today?

00:04.880 --> 00:06.923
Whoa! Lotta new flavours.

00:07.382 --> 00:10.301
Michael felt bad about the sinkhole,
so he wanted to give you all a little treat.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.054
I recommend "Full Cell phone Battery."

00:14.640 --> 00:15.556
Whoa.

00:16.141 --> 00:19.602
It somehow tastes how I felt
when my cell phone was fully charged.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.145
Oh, I'm so relaxed!

00:21.980 --> 00:23.022
But they all look good.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.357
This might take me a while.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.901
You know what, Gunnar?
Uh, why don't you go ahead?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.444
Thanks so much, Eleanor.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.695
Mm-hmm.
- What can I get you, Gunnar?

00:29.821 --> 00:32.114
Hi, Janet. Can I have some folded laundry?

00:32.449 --> 00:33.491
Coming up.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.628
Chidi!

00:46.171 --> 00:47.171
You'll never believe it.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.714
I was at the frozen yogurt place

00:48.799 --> 00:50.758
and I didn't know what I wanted
so I turned to the guy behind me

00:50.842 --> 00:53.177
and I was like: "Why don't you go ahead."

00:53.262 --> 00:55.346
Just like that! "Why don't you go ahead."

00:56.390 --> 00:57.306
Oh... okay.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.724
Dude, you don't understand.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.185
I never did stuff like that when I was on Earth!

01:01.311 --> 01:04.730
But now, thanks to your "good person" lessons
I didn't hold up the line,

01:04.773 --> 01:06.691
I didn't even try a dozen samples

01:06.775 --> 01:09.819
I didn't want, just to spite some jerk
who told me I was holding up the line.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.531
You do that?
- No, Chidi. I used to do that.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.909
Now I do selfless things,
without even thinking about it.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.328
I'm getting better.
- That's great.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.830
I'm... I'm proud of you.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.415
So where's our yogurt?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.333
Ugh, I forgot it.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.128
Oh. Can you go?

01:27.212 --> 01:28.296
I don't wanna go all the way back.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.756
I ran all the way here and it was so hot.

01:32.467 --> 01:36.178
I mean, I will happily get it
because I told you I would.

01:39.850 --> 01:40.891
Good person.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.944
So, to sum up. Utilitarianism posits that...

01:52.154 --> 01:55.197
the correct choice is the one
that causes the most good

01:55.365 --> 01:58.326
or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.619
I like this one.

01:59.911 --> 02:03.581
It's simple. Ugh. Screw all the other
complicated theories.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.915
Why didn't you start with this one?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.292
Ah, but here's the problem.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.337
If all that matters is the sum total
of goodness

02:09.421 --> 02:12.214
the you can justify anything number
of bad actions like...

02:12.758 --> 02:16.093
torturing one innocent person
to save a hundred or pre-emptive war.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.263
Oh, dip, I get it!
It's like, I knew this girl Sheila?

02:19.598 --> 02:22.642
She was a black market alligator dealer,
with a pierced jawbone.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.269
Um. Okay. What?

02:25.354 --> 02:27.897
Sheila was gonna get married
to my boy Donkey Doug

02:28.148 --> 02:29.899
and make him move to Sarasota.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.901
It would have broken up my whole
breakdancing crew

02:31.985 --> 02:34.487
and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker!

02:34.655 --> 02:38.991
So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards
in Sheila's garage and called the cops.

02:39.618 --> 02:44.246
I framed one innocent gator dealer, to save
a sixty-person dance crew.

02:44.414 --> 02:49.460
Shockingly, that is a relevant example
of the Utilitarian dilemma. Well done.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.170
Thanks! Um...

02:52.839 --> 02:53.881
Ah, yes, Jianyu?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.049
Can I be excused?

02:55.133 --> 02:59.053
Tahani's doing a brunch party and I want to
get there before all the mini-waffles run out.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.390
Oh, it's the Good Place.
You can get all the mini waffles you want at any time.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.600
So, I'm not excused?

03:05.394 --> 03:07.019
Go ahead, man.
- Yes!

03:08.980 --> 03:11.190
So, you want to roll right into
another lesson?

03:12.109 --> 03:15.236
I am revved up to learn, man!
My brain is horny!

03:15.320 --> 03:18.531
Can we take a little break?
I've been standing at this chalkboard all day.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.491
Oh, yeah. I get it. Oh! You could, um...

03:20.659 --> 03:23.035
grade my paper I wrote
on the concept of Dharma.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.245
Six pages!

03:24.329 --> 03:27.164
And I didn't even do that thing
where I tried to make it longer

03:27.249 --> 03:29.625
by starting every sentence with,
"Interestingly".

03:29.751 --> 03:31.669
Sure, I'll... I'll do that and

03:32.838 --> 03:34.004
we can start another lesson.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.345
Oh, I hope you are both enjoying this brunch.
This is a fabulous jacket.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.306
Oh, you're both so attractive.
Hello, Jianyu.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.142
Syrup?
- Oh, right there.

03:46.810 --> 03:47.852
Chatty today, aren't we?

03:48.145 --> 03:52.356
Ah, Tahani. I've been working on
my Western Hemisphere brunch banter.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.649
Tell me what you think.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.318
"That New Yorker article was crazy."

03:56.611 --> 03:58.362
"You haven't seen Hamilton?"

03:58.613 --> 04:00.156
"Hey, did you hear about Stephanie?"

04:00.407 --> 04:02.908
- Very well done, Michael.
- Hi there!

04:02.951 --> 04:06.203
We have a category 55
Emergency Doomsday Crisis.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.625
A category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.712
Sorry, what is a category 55
Emergency Doomsday Crisis?

04:15.046 --> 04:17.381
It's nothing.
It's a tiny little inconvenience.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.634
Tahani, dear,
could you show us to a private room

04:20.719 --> 04:24.764
where no one could see or hear us,
even if I yell very loudly out of fear?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.897
It appears that the sinkhole is not
repairing itself.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.065
This is very bad, Janet.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.735
We have to go into the sinkhole,
and fix it by hand.

04:37.944 --> 04:38.986
Get the tools.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.573
Sorry, can I be of any service?
- Ah! Tahani.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.285
Didn't see you there...
No, we're just having a slight problem

04:46.328 --> 04:48.913
with the enormous sinkhole.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.249
Yes, I meant to tell you.
I walked past it last night and I...

04:52.667 --> 04:53.959
I actually saw it get a little bit bigger.

04:55.629 --> 04:59.423
It got bigger? Ah, well. That's so so normal.

04:59.508 --> 05:03.552
This is the reaction I have when things
are incredibly mundane and expected.

05:03.637 --> 05:09.767
I'm going to leave now, at my regular pace,
as I do in most scenarios.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.193
Finally! Let's get back to it!

05:19.986 --> 05:22.905
Whip out that chalkboard, big boy,
show me what you're working with!

05:23.114 --> 05:27.827
Actually, I was going to head into town
and pick up some blankets.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.121
Great, I'll grab my sweater. Plus...

05:31.206 --> 05:33.040
I can practise letting people
cut in front of me.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.960
Please. You go ahead. I respect you.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.420
You're not just an obstacle
for me getting what I want.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.882
You know?
Uh, I just realised that I have blankets.

05:42.008 --> 05:46.679
So I'm going to take a nap using the several
blankets that I already have. Good night!

05:47.597 --> 05:50.683
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
What's wrong? Out with it.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.310
Fine, I'm just tired.
Need a break. No big deal.

05:53.395 --> 05:57.022
The way you're talking to me right now?
"Everything's cool, " "no big deal."

05:57.107 --> 05:57.940
I know that move.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.902
When I told a boyfriend something was
"no big deal," it meant anything from

06:02.153 --> 06:03.779
"I just bought weed from your nephew,"

06:03.864 --> 06:06.532
to "I secretly befriended
your ex-girlfriend last year

06:06.616 --> 06:08.701
things got out of hand
and now I'm her bridesmaid."

06:08.785 --> 06:12.746
Wow. Okay, well,
in this case, it really is no big deal.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.792
Dude, you're hiding something. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

06:18.003 --> 06:22.590
What is wrong?

06:31.808 --> 06:35.519
Jianyu second! Oh, well done, my love.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.938
So where am I?

06:38.773 --> 06:41.233
Eleanor sixth? Come on.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.913
Oh, no. I'm second to last.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.292
I barely made it.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.088
Mummy, I made you this.
It's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.133
Thank you, Tahani. It's very competent.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.218
I made a bird as well.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.387
I worked in reflective alloy

07:10.555 --> 07:12.848
holding up a mirror to mankind and its

07:12.933 --> 07:14.808
and its mistreatment of
these defenceless animals.

07:14.893 --> 07:20.481
Excellent, Kamilah. I sense the influence
of Brancusi, and Kapur.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.274
It seems you're moving out
of your structural period,

07:22.359 --> 07:24.443
and more into conceptual abstraction.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.821
Good eye, mother.
I grew tired of objective representation.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.156
I trust my audience.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.408
My birdie has a hat!

07:31.618 --> 07:33.452
Yes. Well done, Tahani.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.205
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.331
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.457
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.879
Nothing's wrong.
Would you stop doing that?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.173
Okay, fine.
You want to know what's wrong?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.425
You are a full-time job.

07:48.677 --> 07:52.096
I wake up there's Eleanor.
I spend all day teaching Eleanor.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.349
And then, it's "Good night, Eleanor.
Oh, this is a nice dream.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.308
My grandma's here... wait!

07:56.393 --> 07:59.561
She's got Eleanor's face!
And tentacles for some reason."

07:59.646 --> 08:02.982
Don't blame me for your weird grandma dreams.
That's on you, dude.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.818
And I thought you liked teaching me.

08:05.986 --> 08:10.072
So now I'm just some huge burden for you?
- Yes! Of course you are!

08:10.156 --> 08:11.490
I am in paradise!

08:11.574 --> 08:14.743
I should be doing paradise things,
like rowing out on a lake

08:14.828 --> 08:17.037
with a good bottle of wine,
reading French poetry.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.207
That's your idea of "paradise?" That sucks!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.710
You know, and I can't stop helping you

08:22.794 --> 08:25.087
because then I am shirking my ethical duty.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.549
It's an impossible position!
- Well, excuse me

08:28.591 --> 08:30.259
for trying to stay out of the Bad Place.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.178
You know what, if you're so stressed
from writing on a chalkboard

08:33.388 --> 08:34.471
why don't you just leave?

08:34.556 --> 08:36.390
We could pretend to be soulmates in public

08:36.474 --> 08:38.100
but other than that
we don't have to see each other!

08:38.143 --> 08:40.269
Fine with me. I'll move out right now.
- Fine!

08:41.604 --> 08:42.646
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

08:42.731 --> 08:44.106
<i>As you all may remember</i>

08:44.190 --> 08:47.026
<i>a sinkhole recently opened up
in the town centre.</i>

08:47.277 --> 08:49.737
<i>The situation, sadly, has worsened.</i>

08:50.113 --> 08:54.116
<i>Starting right now no one may go outside
under any circumstances.</i>

08:54.659 --> 08:57.745
<i>Leaving your homes
could result in catastrophic damage</i>

08:58.204 --> 09:01.040
<i>to you and to the very fabric of the universe.</i>

09:01.499 --> 09:02.541
<i>Okay, bye!</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:05.961
Or we could both just stay here.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.426
We hope you enjoy
<i>your eternal stay in the Good Place.</i>

09:12.802 --> 09:17.514
<i>Take advantage of our day spa,
or Janet, a magical assistant.</i>

09:17.640 --> 09:19.266
<i>who can get you whatever you want.</i>

09:19.559 --> 09:23.312
<i>And explore the grounds on one of our
complimentary pegasi.</i>

09:23.396 --> 09:25.856
Do you mind turning that off?
It's been playing on a loop for two days.

09:26.149 --> 09:30.444
The whole Neighbourhood is offline.
We only get the welcome channel.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.988
I would love to not watch TV

09:33.406 --> 09:35.407
but you cancelled school.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.368
What have you done to me, you monster?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.455
Look at all these dishes piling up.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.667
I used to just throw them in the sink
and they'd be magically cleaned by morning.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.337
I did that. I cleaned the dishes.
- Oh.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.214
Then what's up with these bad boys?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.342
You are unbelievable.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.511
Are you still upset? You're not over it yet?

09:55.595 --> 09:59.098
How can I be "over" it?
We haven't discussed it, or even spoken for days.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.976
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice
"vacation" from your "full-time job."

10:03.103 --> 10:05.479
Get your story straight, bro.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.730
Hey, guys? It's Michael.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.276
Hi, Michael! What a lovely surprise!

10:11.694 --> 10:13.695
Oh, I'd love to make small talk.
I've been practicing, too.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.448
I'm amazing at it.
But I'm in a bit of a rush here.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.866
This is Bart and Nina

10:18.409 --> 10:21.286
They live right next to the, uh...
sinkhole, so...

10:21.746 --> 10:23.288
they obviously need a place to stay.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.291
I was wondering, as my assistant,
maybe you could put them up for a while?

10:26.793 --> 10:30.170
Oh, of course. Don't... don't think twice.
- Okay. Shouldn't take long.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.590
Between an hour and, um... eleven months.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.759
Somewhere in there. Okay, bye!

10:37.554 --> 10:38.595
Don't go outside.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.315
We're doomed.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.568
Dude. You need to chill the fork out.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.361
How? We are living a lie.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.781
We are fighting and one small mistake
could blow our cover

10:57.866 --> 10:58.949
and make the whole world go crazy.

10:59.033 --> 11:02.077
All we need to do is make a little small talk.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.121
Just say things that aren't lies.

11:04.372 --> 11:10.127
Like, isn't Eleanor super hot?
Or, I'm Chidi, I lost my virginity to a book.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.378
Tea's ready!

11:11.462 --> 11:14.840
Thank you guys so much.
Sorry for the imposition.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.216
Oh, bah!

11:16.301 --> 11:19.428
If you want to know the truth,
we asked Michael if we could stay with you.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.889
We are obsessed with your relationship.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.725
Always whispering,
locking yourself in the house all day.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.769
I thought I was an expert in true love
'cause of my old job

11:27.854 --> 11:30.355
but I have a lot to learn from you guys.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.940
Your job? What was your job?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.192
I was a marriage counsellor.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.236
You could say I wrote the book
on healthy relationships

11:36.863 --> 11:38.614
and I did!

11:38.740 --> 11:43.160
It's called "How to Spot Problems
in a Marriage From 100 Miles Away."

11:43.244 --> 11:44.703
Oh! Cool.
- Oh, cool.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.413
Yeah, really cool.
- Cool. Cool.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.665
Cool. And what about you, Bart?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.876
Ah, well, my job wasn't nearly as
interesting.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.587
Nah, I started a company
that investigated identity theft.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.215
Analysing body language,
tracking and catching people

11:56.299 --> 11:57.382
pretending to be someone they're not.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.761
It was snooze, am I right?

12:00.929 --> 12:05.807
You know what? Forget this tea.
Who wants too much wine?

12:05.892 --> 12:08.227
Oh!

12:08.728 --> 12:09.770
Hello, everyone

12:09.854 --> 12:12.940
and welcome to Day Three
of our brunch siege!

12:13.024 --> 12:16.860
I stayed up all night
to plan a full day of fun activities

12:17.153 --> 12:18.779
just check the schedule I made!

12:19.572 --> 12:22.699
- Tahani, you are truly the best.
- Hear! Hear!

12:22.825 --> 12:24.993
Yes, you would think so,
wouldn't you, Henriette?

12:28.122 --> 12:31.875
Still second to last?

12:35.922 --> 12:36.964
Tahani.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.384
This auction threatens to be an
embarrassing failure.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.387
Five-point-two million isn't bad.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.555
It's very "middle-thermometer."

12:45.974 --> 12:50.018
Your public failure is our public failure.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.687
You know what has to be done.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.689
I'm very pleased...

12:53.773 --> 12:56.817
to announce that there has been an addition
to today's docket.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.530
I'm sure you all know my sister Kamilah.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.909
Yes. Kamilah.

13:06.244 --> 13:10.163
Kamilah, of course, is the youngest person
ever to graduate from Oxford University.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.542
She's a Eurovision Award-winning
singer-song writer

13:13.876 --> 13:16.336
a world-class painter, social activist

13:16.421 --> 13:20.590
sculptor, Olympic gold medallist for archery

13:20.675 --> 13:22.050
an iconoclast

13:22.802 --> 13:27.973
A Bafta Award-winner for her documentary
on her Grammy Award-winning album

13:28.266 --> 13:32.144
and the person voted
"Most Likely to be Banksy."

13:33.354 --> 13:36.523
So without further ado
take it away from me!

13:36.816 --> 13:39.109
Sorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah!

13:42.989 --> 13:45.157
I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.578
The bidding shall commence
at three million pounds.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.207
You're bidding?

13:54.417 --> 13:58.128
Of course.
It's an hour with Kamilah Al-Jamil!

13:58.796 --> 13:59.838
Five million!

14:07.638 --> 14:10.599
Wow. You guys must really love clowns, huh?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.852
Would two people who didn't love clowns
have this many clowns on their walls?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.688
It must be great to live with such
a positive person. Huh, Chidi?

14:16.773 --> 14:20.901
Well, it's um... at times it's... person.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.490
Ugh. That's my Chidi.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.867
One glass of wine, he's totally useless.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.454
You know what you need right now, dear?

14:32.497 --> 14:33.914
To get into something more comfortable

14:33.956 --> 14:36.708
like one of your trademark
taupe V-neck sweaters.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.503
You know how strongly I feel about those.

14:39.921 --> 14:40.962
- Aw.
- Ooh..

14:41.005 --> 14:42.339
So cute.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.758
Oh, love, love, love!

14:44.842 --> 14:46.259
Love, love, love!

14:49.597 --> 14:52.099
You couldn't think of one thing to say?
Get your head in the game, man.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.183
They're gonna catch us.

14:53.267 --> 14:57.187
This is an extremely precarious situation.
I am vexed, Eleanor!

14:57.271 --> 14:59.481
A marriage counsellor
and a human lie detector

14:59.565 --> 15:03.819
isn't my first choice for company either,
but they have no reason to suspect us.

15:04.821 --> 15:09.157
Plus, I think they may have actually
just come here to, you know?

15:09.534 --> 15:10.575
Swing.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.702
I say we do it.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.496
It'll get them to stop asking questions.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.875
I am not going to have sex with someone
to get them to stop talking to me.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.086
Really? You and I are very different.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.672
Yeah, I noticed.
- You know what, man?

15:23.881 --> 15:26.758
I have spent every second in this place
worried I was gonna get caught

15:26.843 --> 15:29.845
but if we go down right now,
that's on you. Okay?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.098
Oh, you spend all your time teaching a
charming, awesome lady?

15:33.182 --> 15:35.725
How sad for you. Face it, dude.

15:35.810 --> 15:40.439
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
Because guess what, Chidi? Ya basic.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.900
Eleanor.
- Yeah, I know. You wanna do that thing

15:43.985 --> 15:47.487
where we're arguing and fighting,
but then suddenly it's like "Whoa, this is hot,"

15:47.572 --> 15:49.364
and we start making out? Dream on!

15:49.657 --> 15:50.782
Or, whatever, fine, let's just do it.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.284
No! Eleanor, look.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.960
So, how much of that did you hear?

16:02.044 --> 16:04.629
We couldn't hear you but I'm an expert
in non-verbal communication

16:04.714 --> 16:07.048
and it is clear you are in conflict.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.135
We're not judging you.
This has been a tough couple of weeks.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.347
I'm sure the... the stress of the sinkhole
has caused lots of soulmate squabbles.

16:15.016 --> 16:19.978
That's what it is! A squabble. We're squabbling.
- Squabble-squabble!

16:20.188 --> 16:22.439
I can help.
I'm going to take your relationship

16:22.523 --> 16:24.274
and put it under a microscope

16:24.609 --> 16:27.319
And dig and poke and prod

16:27.403 --> 16:30.363
until you are back to soulmate harmony.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.698
Eleanor, why don't you tell...

16:31.782 --> 16:34.284
She never does the dishes.
I have to do them all the time.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.204
We just have different interests.
- Mm-hmm.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.957
I like relaxing, he likes getting
on my case about the dishes.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.834
I'm getting a lot of repressed anger.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.420
I suspected this when I arrived,
but now I'm sure.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.881
You are hiding something.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.425
What are earth would I be hiding?
- No, no, no, not you...

16:51.427 --> 16:52.469
Him.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.307
<i>Please go back inside.</i>

16:57.391 --> 17:01.436
<i>It isn't safe to be out of your home.
Please go back inside.</i>

17:01.521 --> 17:03.271
Janet, could you see what's wrong?

17:03.773 --> 17:04.814
Everything.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.234
Oh!

17:08.319 --> 17:10.529
My goodness. It's even worse than I thought.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.113
Tahani, what are you doing here?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.492
Well, everyone else might be okay
staying inside, but I wanted to help.

17:15.618 --> 17:19.287
So I brought some cheer
and sustenance, to raise your spirits.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.580
Look, I made donut holes.

17:21.082 --> 17:25.502
Do you get it? Donut holes,
sinkhole. Funny, no?

17:25.628 --> 17:28.630
No, too soon. By exactly nine days.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.716
Tahani, this sinkhole is incredibly
dangerous.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.428
If a human gets too close to it
there could be disastrous side effects.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.723
What's... what's happening to me?

17:38.766 --> 17:40.392
Ooh, that's one of the side effects.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.769
Janet, knock her out,
while we still have time, please.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.188
Knock me out? What does that...

17:48.651 --> 17:51.361
Guys, really, it's no big deal.

17:51.445 --> 17:56.157
"It's not a big deal" is nearly always
code for "something is wrong."

17:56.242 --> 17:58.118
Boom! That's what I said!

17:58.202 --> 17:59.536
I should've been a marriage counsellor.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.747
Lets take the positive aspects
of this relationship.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.249
Let's focus on that first.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.252
What do you do to make Eleanor feel valued?

18:08.045 --> 18:14.634
I spend every waking moment thinking
about her and supporting her.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.344
Beautifully said.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.972
Eleanor, what do you do to support Chidi?

18:19.432 --> 18:20.473
I...

18:21.851 --> 18:25.395
taught him how to reheat cold pizza
with a curling iron.

18:26.647 --> 18:30.150
But this isn't about me
or my awesome life hacks.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.652
He's hiding something,
and we need to get to the bottom of it.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.487
She's right, Chidi. Out with it.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.741
What is so unsatisfying about
your soulmate relationship?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.327
Be honest, Chidi. Be like...

18:40.620 --> 18:43.747
the exact right amount of honest

18:43.831 --> 18:46.207
so that we can both be happy.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.046
I never had a soulmate on earth.

18:51.339 --> 18:56.259
I never even really had a girlfriend
that I loved.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.431
And when I got here and Michael said
I would finally meet my actual soulmate

19:01.515 --> 19:03.933
I was so excited. And it isn't...

19:05.811 --> 19:06.853
exactly...

19:08.064 --> 19:09.105
what I thought.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.525
You've never had
an intense relationship before.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.944
This is all uncharted territory.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.322
No wonder you're so tense!

19:17.907 --> 19:21.701
You know, Nina and I are skilled
in the art of massage.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.412
Not erotic massage.
- Mm.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.165
- Although it can be, it often leads there anyway.
- Okay!

19:27.249 --> 19:28.500
Well, you know what?

19:28.751 --> 19:32.045
You guys have given us so much to think about
and I think we should go to bed.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.506
Just the two of us, alone.
Just us.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.800
I know it's not the right time,
but I told you.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.552
You know after an
emotional breakthrough like that

19:39.637 --> 19:42.305
you guys aren't gonna do much sleeping.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.807
Yeah, I know.

19:44.016 --> 19:49.688
We're gonna keep our clothes. I'll sleep on the floor
and we'll maintain a chilly silence until morning.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.523
Could you imagine?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.735
Well, that's terrifying.
- Mm.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.532
Tahani? Wake up, dear.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.160
Michael, did it work?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.413
Did I fix the sinkhole?

20:06.706 --> 20:07.580
Am I a heroine?

20:07.665 --> 20:12.127
No. You did something catastrophically stupid
and we had to knock you unconscious.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.671
Why in the world did you go outside?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.757
Because I saw the rankings in the manual.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.636
That manual is only meant to be seen
by Architects and Janets.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.347
It's got some very sensitive material.

20:24.515 --> 20:28.309
Plus some song lyrics I've been working on,
and I'd rather not let people see those

20:28.394 --> 20:29.477
until they're finished.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.271
But, anyway...

20:31.772 --> 20:34.691
Why did seeing the rankings unravel you so?

20:37.403 --> 20:40.780
I was so sorry to hear
of your parents' passing.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.117
Please bear with me as I share
their last will and testament.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.911
To Kamilah, we have left
sixty-eight million pounds

20:46.996 --> 20:52.000
the home in Kensington, their yacht,
and other assorted weekend boats.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.086
But what did they leave
their second-favourite child?

20:55.463 --> 20:58.923
There's still quite a lot of
money and property that goes to you.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.675
There is one issue, however.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.637
They have, um...
spelled your name incorrectly, in the will.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.055
You've got to be kidding me.

21:06.265 --> 21:11.060
It says, "We bequeath the rest
of our estate to Tahini." Like the sauce.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.272
You know what? I don't want the money.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.900
My sister can have it all.

21:17.276 --> 21:22.447
My whole life I have lived in your shadow,
but now I'm going to step out of it.

21:22.698 --> 21:27.660
I am going to reach heights of success
and sophistication you could only dream of.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.412
Your cardigan's on inside out.

21:29.663 --> 21:33.792
I know! It's a new trend that I am starting.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.753
Just one example of how I'm going
to step out of your shadow.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.131
Oh, please wait.
I'm obligated to say one more thing.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.134
Kamilah, I'm taken by you.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.763
Your very presence is magnetic.

21:47.348 --> 21:51.267
I may be married and I've never been interested
in any woman before

21:51.602 --> 21:55.688
but my attraction for you
goes beyond sexuality.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.192
Though it certainly is deeply sexual.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.196
Oh, for crying out loud! Come on!

22:05.533 --> 22:08.451
Oh, I'm sorry that I looked
at the rankings, Michael.

22:08.536 --> 22:11.538
But I just don't understand
how I'm so low.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.791
My entire life I have tried to be
extraordinary

22:14.875 --> 22:16.501
but it just never seemed to be enough.

22:17.044 --> 22:22.674
Ah. And you thought you could increase
your ranking by helping us fix the sinkhole.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.509
Tahani.

22:25.261 --> 22:28.471
Tahani, the point evaluations stop
the moment you die.

22:28.597 --> 22:32.141
But also, out of literally billions

22:32.601 --> 22:35.854
you were one of the most remarkable people
on Earth.

22:36.647 --> 22:40.149
You have nothing left to prove, to anyone.

22:40.901 --> 22:41.943
Hi there!

22:42.152 --> 22:44.445
The sinkhole has begun to repair itself!

22:44.572 --> 22:45.613
It has?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.031
Could it be?
- But how?

22:47.116 --> 22:50.869
Did I, "Tahani saves the uni--"
- No, no, no, still not you.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.204
You had nothing to do with it.
We'd better leave immediately.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.918
Oh. Morning, Chidi.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.087
Michael just lifted the lockdown.
We can all go outside again.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.465
Say goodbye to Eleanor for us.
Oh, she left you a note by the dishes.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.888
And if you ever want to come to our house,
break out the massage oils

23:10.222 --> 23:12.140
And, uh... see what unfolds.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.852
Okay. Great. Thank you, Nina.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.445
Morning, teach!

23:25.529 --> 23:28.323
Morning. What's this about?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.158
Well, here's what I realised.

23:30.492 --> 23:34.078
It's not just that helping me is a full-time
job that you feel you have to do.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.041
The real problem is that
the more you help me

23:38.125 --> 23:42.462
the greater the chance is that I can stay
here, and me staying here means

23:42.671 --> 23:44.505
you'll never get a real soulmate.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.842
I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.846
Every ounce of my happiness
leads to a ton of pain for you.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.808
So, every time
the simple fact of my existence

23:56.185 --> 23:57.518
starts to bum you out

23:58.729 --> 24:00.605
I want you to hold this up.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.316
At which point

24:03.359 --> 24:06.277
I will leave you alone,
for as long as you need.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.989
I know we'll never be soulmates,
but we're friends.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.076
So I'm going to help you have the paradise
you always wanted.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.372
Side note, I can't believe this is
the paradise you always wanted, but...

24:18.749 --> 24:20.959
get in this boat,
and read some boring French poetry.

24:32.262 --> 24:35.765
I... I've never actually done this before.
This is... this is a theoretical fantasy.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.809
How do you row a boat?

24:38.894 --> 24:41.229
I tell you, it's good as new.
Go ahead, if you want. Just here.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.773
Whoo! See? You can jump up and down on it.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.067
Hey boss, so you fixed the sinkhole?

24:46.151 --> 24:48.403
Yep! Good as new! Crisis averted!

24:48.487 --> 24:52.240
Everybody, have a wonderful day
because I fixed the sinkhole.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.033
I didn't fix the sinkhole.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.203
Sorry?
- I tried and I tried but nothing worked.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.540
And then all of a sudden, this morning,
out of the blue! Just whoop!

25:00.749 --> 25:02.500
It just closed over.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.337
Huh! How about that?

25:07.006 --> 25:10.758
Well, as your assistant,
I officially declare this good news!

25:10.843 --> 25:12.635
No, this is terrible news.

25:13.303 --> 25:17.473
I have no idea what caused it,
Eleanor, and no idea what fixed it.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.935
I want you to come to my office
first thing in the morning.

25:21.562 --> 25:24.939
You and I are gonna find this problem.
