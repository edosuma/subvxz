Nervous before the shows?

00:31.823 --> 00:32.824
I don't think it's nervous,

00:33.033 --> 00:34.706
it's just like anxiety,
so to speak,

00:34.910 --> 00:36.628
but not in a stressful way.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.627
It's like me getting
ready, prepared,

00:39.831 --> 00:42.050
so it's just like, I'm
thinking about every moment,

00:42.251 --> 00:44.424
every step, and every second,
so it's just like,

00:44.628 --> 00:46.847
okay, cool, let's go out
there and do our thing.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.674

00:48.882 --> 00:50.680
some nights I'm just
confident and just having fun,

00:50.884 --> 00:53.512

I got a point to prove,

00:53.720 --> 00:55.814
show them why I need
to be doing this.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.937
You know, it's disappointing
for me in certain ways,

00:58.141 --> 00:59.358
because I feel like, you know,

00:59.560 --> 01:02.404
certain aspects of
my career sometimes

01:02.604 --> 01:05.197
are overshadowed by
the negative stuff.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.369
So, it's like, it kind of like,
fucks with my head a lot.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.663
Now, how I transition
my creativity,

01:10.862 --> 01:13.866
it's basically all I wanna
kind of show, you know,

01:14.074 --> 01:15.997
'cause I'm tired
of giving people

01:16.201 --> 01:18.078
something to talk
about, you know.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.038
They should be talking
about how

01:19.246 --> 01:19.838
I'm the baddest motherfucker

01:20.038 --> 01:22.382

01:25.586 --> 01:26.803
You know what I'm saying?

01:27.004 --> 01:27.926

01:28.130 --> 01:29.347
whether whatever
problems going on,

01:29.548 --> 01:30.800
like, everybody goes
through their shit,

01:31.008 --> 01:32.510
I go through my shit
most of the time.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.437
You know, I got a problem
everyday, but it's like,

01:35.637 --> 01:37.890
I try to just keep
my head on straight,

01:38.098 --> 01:39.441
and I kind of channel
some of that energy,

01:39.641 --> 01:41.860

upset about something,

I come from a small town,
Tappahannock, Virginia.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.740
As you see me
throughout my journey,

03:52.941 --> 03:54.818
I was about 15 when I started.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.529

<i>♪ It was about

04:00.282 --> 04:01.750
It was a good start for me as a,

04:01.950 --> 04:05.830
as a kid, to be able to kind
of start off green, in a way.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.584
Chris was very, very active

04:07.789 --> 04:12.295
at a very early age, probably
one, before he was walking.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.924
<i>He started out in child care,</i>

04:14.129 --> 04:15.722
'cause I run a
child care center,

04:15.922 --> 04:17.765
and he was probably
one of the most active

04:17.966 --> 04:20.890
child in the facility itself.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.846
<i>Since he was, like, two,</i>

04:23.054 --> 04:25.807
he wanted to look at
Michael Jackson videos

04:26.016 --> 04:28.314
and dance, I mean,
he could come to my house

04:28.518 --> 04:31.237
and get in between the
doorways and actually

04:31.438 --> 04:34.032
climb them and do
backflips, you know, so,

04:34.232 --> 04:38.112
he was always full of
energy, all the time.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.993
He would go over
to relatives' houses,

04:40.197 --> 04:42.120
<i>and when that happened nobody
wanted him to spend the night,</i>

04:42.324 --> 04:44.292

jumping from bed to bed.</i>

04:44.493 --> 04:45.836

04:46.036 --> 04:46.958
<i>all my life, of course,</i>

04:47.162 --> 04:49.335
so he would sit in
front of the TV,

04:49.539 --> 04:51.962
he would try to mimic his moves.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.010
Being able to see stuff on TV,

04:54.211 --> 04:55.758
whether it be my idol,
Michael Jackson,

04:55.962 --> 04:58.215
<i>or anybody that I looked up
to at the time, you know,</i>

04:58.423 --> 05:01.097
I'd be able to try to
put myself in that world.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.644
I just tried to always
look at it like,

05:02.844 --> 05:04.221
"okay, I could do that,"
you know,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.523
being from a small town
where there's not too many

05:06.723 --> 05:09.647
opportunities, but have
that mentality to try

05:09.851 --> 05:12.479
to push forward and be
something bigger and greater.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.439
In school, he liked to be

05:14.648 --> 05:17.151
the center of
attraction. [laughs]

05:17.359 --> 05:18.827
You know, it was
a cool upbringing,

05:19.027 --> 05:21.871
<i>real country, high school
of about maybe 500 kids,</i>

05:22.072 --> 05:25.201

<i>Chris was a haPPY
go lucky type of kid,</i>

05:27.369 --> 05:30.748
was always smiling, always
moving around, dancing.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.833
Every now and then, you might
catch him over there singing,

05:33.041 --> 05:35.009
even on the basketball
court he was somewhat,

05:35.210 --> 05:36.462
I guess you could say creative,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.923
<i>and always moving and
had different moves</i>

05:39.130 --> 05:40.552
<i>than the other kids.</i>

05:40.757 --> 05:42.350
[Joyce] <i>I used to go to
all of his games,</i>

05:42.551 --> 05:43.723
<i>he used to show off a lot.</i>

05:43.927 --> 05:45.270
He's like, doing his
moves on the court,

05:45.470 --> 05:47.472
and I'm like, are we
playing ball here or what?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.150
He was really artistic,
he loved to draw.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.569
<i>They were mostly
drawing assignments,</i>

05:52.769 --> 05:54.942
and he was very good with
the drawing, shading,

05:55.146 --> 05:57.274
and detail, and also
with the coloring.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.325
He missed some time
basically because his,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.153
I guess the routines
he was going through.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.863
With my mom, she was
a supporter from day one

06:03.071 --> 06:05.449
with my music, and my dad,
you know, he was there too,

06:05.657 --> 06:07.785
he actually first taught me
how to moonwalk.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.746
He used to just do it on
gravel one day, and I was like,

06:10.954 --> 06:12.080
man, how did he do that.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.291
[Joyce] <i>He was a kid,
just acting out what he saw.</i>

06:14.499 --> 06:18.504
<i>But he actually sung on
church choirs at a early age.</i>

06:18.712 --> 06:20.055
<i>[Christine]
He was good at everything,</i>

06:20.255 --> 06:21.848
<i>whether he played
basketball or football.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:23.391
<i>He had his own style.</i>

06:23.592 --> 06:25.686
<i>He might not have always
had the means to have,</i>

06:25.886 --> 06:27.763
like, the best of
everything, because,

06:27.971 --> 06:29.223
you know, times are hard.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.900
But he would take older
clothes, rip them up,

06:32.100 --> 06:33.477
tie them back a certain way,

06:33.685 --> 06:35.733
adjust them and
make his own style.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.655
He would dye his hair red.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.824
And then he would go to
school, then he'd sing,

06:40.025 --> 06:42.153
<i>like at basketball
games or football games,</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:43.907
<i>and all the girls
would crowd around him,</i>

06:44.112 --> 06:45.364
<i>so, he really enjoyed that.</i>

06:45.572 --> 06:47.745
I hate performing when
there ain't no girls!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.246
When there ain't no girls
it just takes the life

06:49.451 --> 06:50.577
out the performance,
'cause you can't just--

I would have to give it all

06:59.002 --> 07:00.003
to my family, you know,

07:00.211 --> 07:02.213
I think our values
as family members,

07:02.422 --> 07:05.847
and whether it be your mom
or your dad, cousins, uncles,

07:06.051 --> 07:08.679
aunts, grandma and grandpa,

07:08.887 --> 07:11.766
I think everybody had
a real warm and humble

07:11.973 --> 07:13.316
approach at life.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.768
See, see, how she, you know she,

07:14.976 --> 07:16.353
you know she's really
feeling what you're saying

07:16.561 --> 07:17.437

07:17.646 --> 07:18.863

07:23.818 --> 07:25.786
<i>From the beginning she
always believed in him.</i>

07:25.987 --> 07:27.955
She's actually the one
that said, you can sing!

07:28.156 --> 07:29.373
<i>We“, his father worked
at the gas station,</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:30.200
<i>there was a guy came by</i>

some talent,</i>

07:33.453 --> 07:35.000
well, you know, my son sings.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.833
It was something that I knew
that he was just interested in,

07:38.041 --> 07:39.338
so I just went with the flow.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.543
She pretty much dropped it and

07:40.752 --> 07:42.550
went to New York to be with him.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.301
<i>[Joyce] From there,

have a conversation with Chris.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.280

08:17.330 --> 08:20.334
I told him to make his
decision where he goes

real more than anything.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.470
<i>with a different label.</i>

08:28.675 --> 08:30.518
<i>I was just asking him,
like, who should I go with?</i>

08:30.719 --> 08:33.097
<i>And he was like, just make sure
it's the best decision for you,</i>

08:33.304 --> 08:34.520
<i>whatever decision you pick,</i>

08:34.722 --> 08:35.849
<i>and whatever decision you make</i>

08:36.057 --> 08:37.980
<i>is the best for you.</i>

08:38.183 --> 08:41.063
That was our first
conversation, across the board.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.443
It started from there.

08:43.648 --> 08:48.529
["Run It" by Chris Brown]

08:48.737 --> 08:51.661
His fame came instant, you
know, it came all at once.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.334
<i>He was discovered at the
age of 13 at a gas station</i>

08:54.534 --> 08:55.877
<i>where his father worked,</i>

08:56.077 --> 08:58.421
<i>now he is a platinum
recording artist.</i>

08:58.621 --> 09:01.090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Chris Brown.</i>

09:01.291 --> 09:04.340
Being able to maneuver
at 15 and try to, you know,

09:04.544 --> 09:06.217
and having the success that
I did have at the time,

09:06.421 --> 09:08.048
I was like, man, this is crazy.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.886
When "Run It" came out, I heard
him screaming all the way out,

09:12.093 --> 09:13.970
Mom, Mom, my song
is on the radio!

09:14.179 --> 09:17.774
["Run It" by Chris Brown]

09:20.351 --> 09:21.694
[DJ Khaled] I remember meeting
Chris Brown for the first time

09:21.895 --> 09:27.402
in Miami, we just got
done recording "Run It,"

09:27.609 --> 09:30.032
and as soon as it got
done out the studio,

09:30.236 --> 09:32.159
it got in my hands and
I went on the radio

09:32.363 --> 09:35.537
and broke it, helped
break that record,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.585
it was a record I believed in,

09:37.786 --> 09:39.880
I knew he was gonna
be the next superstar

09:40.080 --> 09:42.048
the day I met him.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.715
<i>I remember the first time
Chris Brown came on 106 & Park.</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:50.174
I saw people lined up all
the way down the block,

09:50.381 --> 09:53.009
<i>and I didn't know, I thought
some kind of fire drill</i>

09:53.218 --> 09:53.969
<i>was taking place</i>

09:54.177 --> 09:55.349
<i>or something like that,</i>

09:55.553 --> 09:57.021
<i>and as I got closer,
I just, you know,</i>

09:57.222 --> 09:58.974
<i>and I saw all those kids,
and then I looked,</i>

09:59.182 --> 10:02.152
<i>and I saw they had spray
paint on the t-shirts and,</i>

10:02.352 --> 10:05.276
you know, the signs that
said marry me, Breezy,

10:05.480 --> 10:08.108
I love you, Breezy,
Chris Brown for life,

10:08.316 --> 10:10.694
and I was like,
what is going on!

10:10.902 --> 10:13.121
It was fun, but also
I'm sure it was very stressful,

10:13.321 --> 10:16.200
because he couldn't
just walk into the store

10:16.407 --> 10:20.332
and go shopping and just go
play basketball at the gym

10:20.537 --> 10:21.959
like he used to.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.586
It wasn't the same anymore.
He didn't understand that,

10:24.791 --> 10:26.418
because he figured he could
just go, and he'd be fine.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.094
I'm a normal kid,
I'm just Chris,

10:28.294 --> 10:30.763
I'm like, no, it doesn't
work that way anymore.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.934
Well, you know, being 14
and 15 with a record deal,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.932
you know, it's the best
feeling in the world,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.013
but it also comes with
complications, you know.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.564
<i>[Jamie] I think it's tough for
anybody</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:40.560
<i>to start out at 14, 15,</i>

10:40.765 --> 10:42.438
'cause you ain't
went to high school,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.895
you ain't had a chance to
like, just live a regular life,

10:45.103 --> 10:47.572
you've already been a star, so
a lot of that's overwhelming.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.524
[Chris] <i>Being that, most of
your family</i>

10:49.732 --> 10:50.733
<i>have dealt with poverty,</i>

10:50.942 --> 10:55.618
<i>and under minimum wage kind
of living most of your life,</i>

10:55.822 --> 10:59.918
$10,000 to me was like,
dang, I'm rich, you know?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.745
My son calls me, I'm at work,

11:01.953 --> 11:03.921
and he goes, Mom,
like, you know,

11:04.122 --> 11:06.341
there's people outside
our door recording

11:06.541 --> 11:09.090
and taking pictures,
from paparazzi to,

11:09.294 --> 11:13.765
even people you knew just made
it different and difficult

11:13.965 --> 11:15.683
having a normal life.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.261
I just was more
overwhelmed by--

11:17.468 --> 11:18.970
but just not letting
it shape me like,

11:19.179 --> 11:20.852
not letting the
money kind of shape

11:21.055 --> 11:22.147
what I wanna do as an artist,

11:22.348 --> 11:24.100
like with every family
you had problems

11:24.309 --> 11:25.526
and complications, you know.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.355
Sometimes jealousy and
envy plays a big role.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.110
It's kind of new to them,

11:30.315 --> 11:33.159
it's not really something
that even myself

11:33.359 --> 11:35.782
really could
comprehend at the time.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.160
His mom and dad, they
had a great relationship,

11:38.364 --> 11:41.789
and one day I guess they
were all together home

11:41.993 --> 11:45.497
as a family and then it,
you know, it fell apart.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.503
Chris not having a
father in the house

11:47.707 --> 11:50.176
made him to grow up faster
than what he actually had to.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.425
<i>It was a lot, it was more than
I knew that he could handle.</i>

11:53.630 --> 11:56.179
<i>[Jamie] What I always called
it is, is I'd tell Chris,</i>

11:56.382 --> 11:57.224
<i>it's God's balance,</i>

11:57.425 --> 11:59.678
<i>God is gonna give you
that great opportunity</i>

11:59.886 --> 12:01.980
to be something fantastic,
and then at the same time,

12:02.180 --> 12:04.182
he's gonna level
darkness around you

12:04.390 --> 12:05.733
that's gonna keep you balanced.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.277
So, with a person that's 14, 15,

12:07.477 --> 12:09.605
<i>hopefully they have
someone there to recognize</i>

12:09.812 --> 12:12.941
<i>the dark patches, and say,
"okay, yeah, we can do this,</i>

12:13.149 --> 12:15.026
<i>but you just gotta
be mindful of that.</i> "

12:15.235 --> 12:16.862
[Joyce] <i>Yeah, it was a
challenge, and this growing up</i>

12:17.070 --> 12:19.823
<i>thinking that he was
in this adult world,</i>

12:20.031 --> 12:22.454
<i>and thinking that he could
deal with the adults, too,</i>

12:22.659 --> 12:24.661
but no, just because
it's there for you,

12:24.869 --> 12:27.372
you're not gonna do that,
that is not what you do.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.050
For me, having my mother
there created a balance,

12:31.251 --> 12:34.471
and I think it was a bit
difficult, period, for him.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.593
[interviewer]
You <i>sound very</i> driven.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.014
<i>- Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah.</i>

12:37.215 --> 12:39.217
- You live with your mom, right?
- Yeah.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.927
I think he felt that he
had to take care of me.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.435
I gotta take care of my mom
because my dad is not there,

12:44.639 --> 12:46.232
I'm the dad of the house,

12:46.432 --> 12:48.526
or he felt that he was
the man of the house,

12:48.726 --> 12:52.151
that's how he thought, and
that's actually what he said.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.528
Your family you expect
to be your family.

12:54.732 --> 12:59.329
So, even family sometimes,
you know, change, and.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.202
At that point,
it was kind of hard,

13:01.406 --> 13:05.081
'cause Chris was back and
forth with me and his father.

13:05.285 --> 13:09.540
Um... and it was hard for his
father because I had left.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.670
He grew up so fast
he didn't really get to have

13:11.874 --> 13:17.176
a childhood or a teenage
life of a normal person.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.677
I actually wanted him
to actually speak

13:18.881 --> 13:20.178
to a psychiatrist

13:20.383 --> 13:22.351
<i>to just prepare him</i>

13:22.552 --> 13:23.974
<i>for what was about to happen,</i>

13:24.178 --> 13:25.771
because he blew up so fast,

13:25.972 --> 13:28.225
knowing that he would not
know how to handle it,

13:28.433 --> 13:31.152
so that he could talk about
it, and how it made him feel,

13:31.352 --> 13:33.446
but we never could
get him to do that.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.114
<i>I wanna be at
the pinnacle, like,</i>

13:35.315 --> 13:37.659
<i>the highest point to
where I'm known as like,</i>

13:37.859 --> 13:39.361
a legend, almost.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.582
Two years ago, this artist
was just another kid

13:44.782 --> 13:45.374
in high school.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.077
Now, two years later,

13:47.285 --> 13:51.165
he's one of the biggest
stars in the world.

13:51.372 --> 13:55.002
Tonight, performing at the
VMAs for the very first time,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.132
Chris Brown.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.931
[audience screaming]

14:00.131 --> 14:02.930
[rap music beat]

14:09.849 --> 14:11.192

I was backstage and my,</i>

14:11.392 --> 14:13.235
<i>my dancer, he ran in,
Moody, he was like,</i>

14:13.436 --> 14:15.154
"yo, you gotta see him,
he's on stage right now,

14:15.355 --> 14:17.483
he's crazy," and I was like,
"I'm coming, I'm coming."

14:17.690 --> 14:21.240
And out of nowhere, I heard
this groundswell of, like,

14:21.444 --> 14:24.539
hysteria, you know what
I'm saying, like, these,

14:24.739 --> 14:28.915
it was just loud, it was loud
as it was when I was on stage.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.292
[audience screaming]

14:35.124 --> 14:38.094
<i>So I ran out there, and
there he was, killing it.</i>

14:38.294 --> 14:40.092
Then I realized, "oh my God,

14:40.296 --> 14:42.970
he is truly gifted,
he's talented, man,"

14:43.174 --> 14:45.176
in a way that we haven't seen

14:45.385 --> 14:47.638
in a long, long time, you know.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.975
<i>He has a gift of, a gift
like Michael Jackson had,</i>

14:52.183 --> 14:53.981
that makes you scratch
your head and say,

14:54.185 --> 14:57.064
what else is he doing, because
I've seen these steps before,

14:57.271 --> 14:58.568
I've seen these moves before,

14:58.773 --> 15:01.196
<i>but what else
is Chris Brown doing?</i>

15:01.401 --> 15:03.153
<i>♪ Coming from wall to wall ♪</i>

15:03.361 --> 15:05.159
When I got in the game,
I kind of was like,

15:05.363 --> 15:07.866
I wouldn't say alone,
but I was, like,

15:08.074 --> 15:09.371
to myself I had to prove myself.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.077
People wanted to be
like, "okay, well, cool,

15:11.285 --> 15:13.583
what is this kid about,
or what can he do?"

15:13.788 --> 15:16.132
[man] <i>Chris Brown
is in the building.</i>

15:16.332 --> 15:21.179
<i>I remember Chris's first
BET Awards performance.</i>

15:21.379 --> 15:23.677
<i>[Terrence] I remember he came
out with that white jacket,</i>

15:23.881 --> 15:25.258
<i>I think I was
backstage at the time,</i>

15:25.466 --> 15:27.184
I had to present shortly after,

15:27.385 --> 15:29.228
and I just remembered
hearing the rumbling,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.022
and so we went, we're
looking at the monitor,

15:31.222 --> 15:33.896
<i>and we're just
watching this kid,</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:36.444
we're watching him kill it.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.271
This dude is really,
really special.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.401
I knew he was special,

15:39.605 --> 15:41.278
but I didn't realize how
incredible the dancing

15:41.482 --> 15:43.701
was until that day.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.371
And I feel blessed to have him.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.791
Really showed the
best of Chris's ability

15:49.991 --> 15:53.746
to sing and dance
and win over a crowd.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.250
Only person having
star power like that

15:55.455 --> 15:57.082
is Michael Jackson.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.926
There's Michael Jackson,
and there's Chris Brown.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.803
And that's just facts.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.726
Just like Michael Jackson
opened the door for Usher,

16:08.926 --> 16:13.898
I believe that Usher
opened the door for Chris.

16:14.098 --> 16:18.478
For any person,
African-American artists period,

16:18.686 --> 16:20.688
to have come up in that
time and be successful,

16:20.897 --> 16:24.697
and have that very delicate
mixture of being a singer,

16:24.901 --> 16:28.121
dancer, performer, entertainer,

16:28.321 --> 16:30.574
man, it was hard.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.660
<i>[Terrence]</i> He <i>was a trailblazer,</i>
he <i>was setting a</i> tone.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.338
You know, there was a shift
in how things were sounding,

16:37.538 --> 16:41.259
and there was this shift
that was happening from,

16:41.459 --> 16:44.463
you know, the grungey street
sound to how rap was just

16:44.670 --> 16:48.265
so hard, to how hip-hop and
R&B and everything was like,

16:48.466 --> 16:51.845
turning into more
dance, and more fun.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.101
<i>When I first
heard Chris's sound,</i>

16:54.305 --> 16:56.933
I was definitely, I just
remember, it was like,

16:57.141 --> 16:59.815
kids just getting always
down, like on the streets,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.818
and doing all these
beatbox dances, and, like,

17:03.022 --> 17:05.491
<i>I'm not a dancer, but I
definitely was dancing,</i>

17:05.691 --> 17:07.819
and I think what Chris
started was kind of like

17:08.027 --> 17:10.906
that confidence boost in,
not only males,

17:11.113 --> 17:12.786
but I think in females too,

17:12.990 --> 17:14.992
and I think he paid
a lot of respect

17:15.201 --> 17:17.374
to the dancer community.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.172
I just remember seeing
this young, fresh face,

17:20.373 --> 17:23.718
a kid, like he was about
to take over the world

17:23.917 --> 17:25.339
in so many ways.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.172

I think that
overpowered everything

18:27.565 --> 18:30.569
as a whole, I think,
people kind of saw it,

18:30.776 --> 18:33.245
and kind of took it
for what it was worth,

18:33.446 --> 18:35.073

know what, this guy is,

18:35.281 --> 18:37.579

I think he has potential,

18:37.783 --> 18:39.330

I don't know if it was
just his passion for it,

18:47.918 --> 18:50.421
or the fact that
he was well-studied,

18:50.630 --> 18:53.600
<i>or just the simple fact
that he just knew where</i>

18:53.799 --> 18:56.518
to put every move, it was
just perfectly placed,

18:56.719 --> 19:00.064
he knew his choreography,
he was well prepared, man.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.313
But greater than just
understanding choreography,

19:03.517 --> 19:06.236
<i>he understood the magic
of singing and dancing,</i>

19:06.437 --> 19:08.360
<i>and that right there
is a technique that not</i>

19:08.564 --> 19:10.111

19:10.316 --> 19:12.569
it takes a lot of
hard work and focus,

19:12.777 --> 19:15.781

to be able to do that,

19:15.988 --> 19:18.036

19:25.456 --> 19:31.384
I think he definitely helped
take kind of R&B and hip-hop

19:31.587 --> 19:34.932
and make it more
popular, for sure,

19:35.132 --> 19:38.511
make it more pop, and more
radio, and just more Top 40.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.421
any type of competition
between him and other artists,

20:05.621 --> 20:08.500
he would kind of always blow
people out of the water.

It was a at show,
I think a Z100 show,

22:32.685 --> 22:35.279
in New York, and we were,
I'd been hearing her,

22:35.479 --> 22:37.732
like, her music and stuff,
from, you know, the radio,

22:37.940 --> 22:40.568
it was a big number one hit.
And I was just sitting there,

22:40.776 --> 22:41.402
I was like, man,

22:41.610 --> 22:42.486
<i>okay, cool, I wanna see what

22:45.072 --> 22:47.166

her at the showing,

and she was like, hey,
what's up, how are you doing?

22:48.993 --> 22:50.961

like, never heard that before,

let me talk to her,

just to be cool with her,

22:58.252 --> 23:00.129
we exchanged information
and stuff like that,

23:00.337 --> 23:02.681
and through passing
we would be on the same shows.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.850

like, would perform,</i>

23:05.050 --> 23:07.599
<i>and then would go

23:07.803 --> 23:09.771

23:11.307 --> 23:13.184

23:14.602 --> 23:16.479

must like my music.

just having fun.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.828

it was like,

23:33.037 --> 23:34.914
right before our
VMA performance,

23:35.122 --> 23:37.841
me and her did the VMA
performance, my first ever one,

23:38.042 --> 23:39.259
and it was a couple
months before that,

23:39.460 --> 23:41.258
and I remember staying
over at her house,

23:41.462 --> 23:43.635
and I was just looking,
like, "Man, what are we doing?"

23:43.839 --> 23:44.965
She was just like,
"What you mean?"

23:45.174 --> 23:47.393
I was like, "I'm always
over here, like,

23:47.593 --> 23:49.140
we like each other, obviously.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.188

23:51.388 --> 23:52.605
"Let's be boyfriend

23:52.806 --> 23:53.932
She's talking like,
"You ain't serious.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.984
I don't think
you wanna do that."

23:56.185 --> 23:57.277
I was like, "Why?"

23:57.478 --> 23:59.025
She said, "No, no,
you ain't ready."

23:59.229 --> 24:02.028
And I was like, "No, I am,
I think I'm ready, for real."

24:02.232 --> 24:04.280
And so then I was like,
I remember, I was like,

24:04.485 --> 24:05.407
I think I love you.
She was like,

24:05.611 --> 24:06.612
she was looking
at me like, "What?"

24:06.820 --> 24:08.037
Like, did I say the word?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.535
You know, so.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.663
<i>You know, at that time

kept it to ourselves.</i>

24:20.459 --> 24:21.802

but right now,

24:26.006 --> 24:26.802
we love each other, so,

24:27.007 --> 24:29.430
I really don't care about
everybody else.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.852
So, we did the show,

24:31.053 --> 24:33.977

when you got a chance

24:34.181 --> 24:37.731

dating, they're talking.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.232

a chance to do that show,

it was kind of like both of us
being able to show the world

26:43.185 --> 26:45.859
around the eighth month
or maybe like a little bit

26:46.063 --> 26:49.033
after that VMA performance,
I just broke it to her,

26:49.233 --> 26:51.656
I said, "Hey, I wanna marry you,
but I wanna be real with you,

26:51.860 --> 26:54.238
I wanna be honest with you
and tell you, you know,

26:54.446 --> 26:56.494
everything, this is what it is.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.915
Before we were together,

26:58.117 --> 27:01.462
me and this other
girl did have sex."

27:01.662 --> 27:04.006
My trust totally
was lost with her,

27:04.206 --> 27:06.049
you know what I'm saying,
she hated me after that,

27:06.250 --> 27:08.844
I tried everything,
like, she didn't care.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.762
She just didn't
trust me after that.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.557
From there, it just went
downhill, because, you know,

27:13.757 --> 27:15.600
there would be fights,
there would be verbal fights,

27:15.801 --> 27:17.644
physical fights as well,
mutual sides,

27:17.845 --> 27:20.098
and this is the first time
I get to say anything,

27:20.305 --> 27:23.149
and, like I said, I still
love Rihanna, but it's,

27:23.350 --> 27:25.068
I'm just gonna be honest.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.441
We would fight each other,

27:26.645 --> 27:28.488
she would hit me,
I would hit her.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.282
And it never was okay,

27:30.482 --> 27:34.112
it was always a point to
where we'd talk about it,

27:34.319 --> 27:36.321
like, "Yo, what the
fuck are we doing?

27:36.530 --> 27:38.157
Like, I don't like that, I
don't like you slapping me."

27:38.365 --> 27:40.288
If I go onstage, I got
a scratch on my face,

27:40.492 --> 27:42.790
and I gotta explain it,
like, "oh no, I fell,"

27:42.995 --> 27:46.340
or, like, "Or you, if you
got a scar or a bruise,

27:46.540 --> 27:49.919
you gotta put makeup on it,
I feel like shit."

27:50.127 --> 27:52.300
I'm not, like,
I'm not ever trying

27:52.504 --> 27:54.552
to put my hands on any female.

27:54.756 --> 27:58.056
Anger or whatever, you have to
walk away from the situation.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.854
Never, ever,
put your hands on anyone.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.056
Yeah, that was his girl,
you know what I'm saying, so,

28:03.265 --> 28:05.609
I feel like, you know,
what he went through,

28:05.809 --> 28:07.482
it was like a test,

28:07.686 --> 28:10.439
and it wasn't so much
of the situation,

28:10.647 --> 28:15.118
I think it was just a test
in life.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.447
[Mike] <i>I was just like Chris,
I was very successful</i>

28:17.654 --> 28:18.200
<i>at a young age,</i>

28:18.405 --> 28:20.123
<i>and when you're
really successful,</i>

28:20.324 --> 28:24.830
I was taught that can't should
be a foreign language to you.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.039
A no should be a
foreign language to you,

28:27.247 --> 28:28.920
you shouldn't be able to
understand the language

28:29.124 --> 28:30.922
of "No," or "You can't."

28:31.126 --> 28:35.097
Like, me, I felt
like a fucking monster.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.425
[female <i>reporter] 20</i> year <i>old
pop star Rihanna is the woman</i>

28:37.633 --> 28:40.762
<i>involved in the alleged
domestic violence assault case.</i>

28:40.969 --> 28:42.095
<i>[Rihanna] I lost
my best friend,</i>

28:42.304 --> 28:44.773
<i>like, everything
I knew switched,</i>

28:44.973 --> 28:47.101
<i>and I couldn't control that.</i>

28:47.309 --> 28:49.778
<i>So, I had to deal with
that, and that's not,</i>

28:49.978 --> 28:52.106
<i>that's not easy
for me to understand.</i>

28:52.314 --> 28:54.737
<i>[Chris] Several years ago
when I was about 17, 18,</i>

28:54.942 --> 28:57.286
<i>you know, the whole
Rihanna incident happened,</i>

28:57.486 --> 29:02.242
<i>and a lot of that,
that changed my life.</i>

29:02.449 --> 29:04.201
<i>That night at that
Clive Davis party,</i>

29:04.409 --> 29:07.834
<i>and 1 made sure the person that
I was involved with before,</i>

29:08.038 --> 29:10.962
<i>I said, "Hey, you can't come
around to these places,"</i>

29:11.166 --> 29:13.635
and the person comes in.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.008
Comes right to the table,
say, hey, what's up y'all,

29:16.213 --> 29:19.012
and I already knew it's
an issue, so I say,

29:19.216 --> 29:22.060
"Hey, cool, and they keep it
moving and leave,"

29:22.261 --> 29:25.140
I look over to Rihanna,
and she's bawling,

29:25.347 --> 29:27.020
she's just crying in the middle,

29:27.224 --> 29:28.897
the ceremony's about to start
and she's just crying,

29:29.101 --> 29:30.227
and I'm like,
"Yo, v0, v0, v0, v0, v0,

29:30.435 --> 29:32.062
please, please babe,
don't do this,

29:32.271 --> 29:33.272
like, don't do
this in here, like,

29:33.480 --> 29:34.857
I didn't know what
her problem is,

29:35.065 --> 29:36.408
I swear to God, I didn't know."

29:36.608 --> 29:38.781
So, she got over it, she
started drinking a little bit,

29:38.986 --> 29:40.829
we both were drinking
a little bit.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.201
We was tipsy, laughing,

29:42.406 --> 29:45.580
joking, you know,
and then we left.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.252
[female reporter] <i>And while
just a few hours ago,</i>

29:47.452 --> 29:49.125
<i>we saw Chris Brown drive off.</i>

29:49.329 --> 29:51.252
<i>According to sources,
the alleged fight broke out</i>

29:51.456 --> 29:56.257
<i>inside a Lamborghini that
was located at Hancock Park.</i>

29:56.461 --> 29:58.429
[Chris] <i>As you know,
young relationships,</i>

29:58.630 --> 30:00.098
any relationships, it's based
on trust,

30:00.299 --> 30:01.300
but because I told her that,

30:01.508 --> 30:02.930
she didn't trust me
with any of that.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.103
So, I would give her
the option that,

30:05.304 --> 30:06.647
"Oh, you can look at my phone."

30:06.847 --> 30:09.270
So I gave her the phone,
she looks at the phone,

30:09.474 --> 30:11.147
and there's a message,
and it says,

30:11.351 --> 30:13.228
"Kill the Grammys,
do your thing,"

30:13.437 --> 30:16.862
and I didn't read the rest of
the message, I didn't open it.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.318
So she opened the message, and
the rest of the message said,

30:19.526 --> 30:21.494
"I'll see you
at the Clive party."

30:21.695 --> 30:24.414
So, all the time
she thought I was lying.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.161
She starts going off,
she throws the phone,

30:26.366 --> 30:27.743
"I hate you, whatever,
whatever,"

30:27.951 --> 30:30.124
starts hitting me,
we're in a little Lamborghini.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.922
You know, she's fighting me,
and I'm like, "Look,

30:32.122 --> 30:33.840
I'm telling you the truth,
I swear to God,

30:33.999 --> 30:35.797
you know, I'm telling
you the truth, stop it."

30:36.001 --> 30:37.719
So then she hits me
a couple more times,

30:37.919 --> 30:41.219
and I just, kind of just, it
doesn't go from translation to,

30:41.423 --> 30:43.096
"Let's sit down,
I'm telling you the truth,"

30:43.300 --> 30:46.895
it goes to now I'm fixing
to be mean, and be evil,

30:47.095 --> 30:48.893
arguing and arguing and arguing.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.316
So then, like, I remember
she tried to kick me,

30:51.516 --> 30:53.518
'cause like, just
her just being upset,

30:53.727 --> 30:55.445
but then, I really hit her.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.615
Like, with a closed fist,
like, I punched her.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.614
You know, and it busted
her lip, and when I saw it,

31:01.818 --> 31:03.035
I was in shock,
I was like, "Fuck,

31:03.236 --> 31:04.829
why the hell did I hit her?"

31:05.030 --> 31:07.283
So, from there, she just
spit in my face, like,

31:07.491 --> 31:09.744
spit the blood on my face,
and I'm like, "Yo,"

31:09.951 --> 31:11.419
so it enraged me
even more, like,

31:11.620 --> 31:14.499
it's a real on fight in a car,
we driving in the street.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.960
So I'm like, "Yo, hey,
we tripping, what the fuck,

31:18.168 --> 31:19.169
like, what are we doing?"

31:19.378 --> 31:20.470
She's trying to
grab for my phone,

31:20.670 --> 31:22.047
and I'm not giving her my phone

31:22.255 --> 31:24.349
to throw it out of the window.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.803
So, she grabs my nuts,
and when she do that,

31:28.011 --> 31:32.061
I actually, I bite her arm,
I think, as I'm driving,

31:32.265 --> 31:33.892
'cause I'm still
trying to drive.

31:34.101 --> 31:37.401
It's just like a petty,
stupid fight going on,

31:37.604 --> 31:38.947
like, and I'm just realizing it,

31:39.147 --> 31:40.865
I'm like, "What the
hell am I doing, bro?

31:41.066 --> 31:43.785
Like, are you honestly doing
this in a car right now?

31:43.985 --> 31:45.453
Like, what are we doing?"

31:45.654 --> 31:46.906
So I pull over in Hancock Park,

31:47.114 --> 31:49.287
maybe less than two, three
miles from her house,

31:49.491 --> 31:51.164
and I'm just trying to
resolve the situation,

31:51.368 --> 31:52.620
I'm not trying to
fight any further,

31:52.828 --> 31:54.080
I don't wanna, like, I love her,

31:54.287 --> 31:56.210
I don't wanna hurt
my girlfriend.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.589
And so, I pull over,
and I said, "Look, like,

31:59.793 --> 32:02.592
I'm telling you the truth,"
like, I'm crying, she's crying.

32:02.796 --> 32:04.264
I'm like, "I'm telling you
the truth, I swear to God,

32:04.464 --> 32:07.764
I didn't do it, I didn't
know she was fucking coming,

32:07.968 --> 32:09.766
I didn't know, I promise."

32:09.970 --> 32:11.472
She just didn't
believe me, like, she,

32:11.680 --> 32:14.433
I just know you lying
to me, lying to me.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.860
So she takes the keys out
of the car, I'm in park,

32:17.060 --> 32:18.403
she takes the keys out
of the car and fakes

32:18.603 --> 32:20.822
like she throws
them out the window.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.821
I'm like, "What are you doing?"
And I get out the car.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.618
When I got out the car,
I'm looking for the keys,

32:25.819 --> 32:26.365
in somebody's yard,

32:26.570 --> 32:29.039
and she yells out,
out her door,

32:29.239 --> 32:30.866
"Help, he's trying to kill me."

32:31.074 --> 32:32.792
I said "Stop, like,
we're gonna get in trouble."

32:32.993 --> 32:36.623
So, I'm looking for the keys,
she's sitting on the keys.

32:36.830 --> 32:39.253
So I'm like, "You know what, I
can't play this game with you."

32:39.458 --> 32:42.678
I'm getting my bags out of
the car, she takes my CDs,

32:42.878 --> 32:44.551
this is back when I
would record on CDs,

32:44.754 --> 32:47.098
you couldn't put on your phone
when you're in the studio.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.768
So I had new music, and she
was just scratching it up,

32:49.968 --> 32:51.891
I just seen her scratching
it up with the keys.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.813
So, I saw her, I just
snatched the bag,

32:54.014 --> 32:55.391
and I was like, "You know what,

32:55.599 --> 32:58.193
you got the keys,
you can drive home."

32:58.393 --> 32:59.485
By this time her lip was busted,

32:59.686 --> 33:01.108
she had a knot 'cause
I pushed her head

33:01.313 --> 33:02.815
up against the window.

33:03.023 --> 33:03.945
And, and...

33:05.317 --> 33:07.411
you know, a lot of
the times, like,

33:07.611 --> 33:10.865
<i>I look back at the picture,
and I'm just like,</i>

33:11.072 --> 33:12.039
<i>"Yo, bro, like,</i>

33:12.240 --> 33:15.665
that's not me, bro, that's not,
that's not me," like...

33:15.869 --> 33:17.746
I just, I hate it to this day,

33:17.954 --> 33:21.128
you know what I'm saying,
that's gonna haunt me forever.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.131
<i>Rihanna}
I was hurt the most.</i>

33:23.335 --> 33:27.966
<i>Nobody felt what I felt,
it happened, it happened to me.</i>

33:28.173 --> 33:31.723
<i>And it happened to me
in front of the world,</i>

33:31.927 --> 33:35.306
<i>it was embarrassing, it was
humiliating, it was hurtful,</i>

33:35.514 --> 33:37.858
<i>you know, it's not easy.</i>

33:38.058 --> 33:40.277
<i>[male reporter]Chris Brown is

33:40.477 --> 33:42.104
<i>Larry King] You're a

33:45.732 --> 33:48.326
<i>"I screwed up"?</i>

33:48.527 --> 33:50.700
Can remember the night when
he called me and was in L.A.,

33:50.904 --> 33:52.406
the incident had happened,

33:52.614 --> 33:54.742
and he said, Mom, please come,

33:54.950 --> 33:56.873
I just did something really bad.

33:57.077 --> 33:58.545
Like, oh my God, what is it?

33:58.745 --> 33:59.871
And this was the Grammys,

34:00.080 --> 34:02.378
the Clive Davis party
we had just left,

34:02.582 --> 34:05.506
<i>with him and Rihanna at
the table, and I'm like,</i>

34:05.710 --> 34:07.712

34:07.921 --> 34:09.342
<i>what he was going to tell me,</i>

34:09.547 --> 34:12.097
and I get to the hotel,
and he's laying in the bed

34:12.300 --> 34:13.141
crying and crying,

34:13.342 --> 34:16.893
and he was hiding, of course,
crying, like, "Mom, Mom,"

34:17.097 --> 34:18.724
I was like, "What did you do?"
and then he told me,

34:18.931 --> 34:21.811
I was like... that was
the worst day of my life,

34:22.018 --> 34:24.362
and probably of his life,
because he,

34:24.563 --> 34:27.112
I just saw that he was
just a broken person.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.112
<i>[Usher] There are these
moments, right,</i>

34:29.317 --> 34:32.411
in every artist's career
that they say,

34:32.612 --> 34:35.331
"What the fuck was I thinking?"

34:35.532 --> 34:37.159
He was laying in bed,
he was crying,

34:37.367 --> 34:39.244
and he was devastated
about what happened,

34:39.452 --> 34:43.547
but his main concern was
how was she and was she okay.

34:43.790 --> 34:47.215
Of course, legal went down
and he was arrested,

34:47.418 --> 34:50.639
or, well, he turned himself in.
<i>So</i> he was just devastated,

34:50.839 --> 34:53.809
<i>and just seeing him in that
state was the worst ever,</i>

34:54.009 --> 34:56.762
<i>and I felt like I was
gonna lose my child.</i>

34:56.969 --> 34:58.347
I hated myself, you know,

34:58.555 --> 35:01.149
I was thinking about suicide
and everything else.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.692
So, it was just like, fuck.

35:02.892 --> 35:05.111
But, from there,
I said, "You know what,

35:05.312 --> 35:07.189
I'm just gonna take
everything that could come,

35:07.397 --> 35:10.992
my consequences for my actions
have to be dealt with."

35:11.192 --> 35:13.661
I turned myself in the next day.

he was 18.</i>

35:16.114 --> 35:17.661
<i>The male's brain
doesn't fully form</i>

35:17.866 --> 35:20.369
in impulse control
until you're 25.

35:20.577 --> 35:23.080
About six years ago
last month I got a call

35:23.288 --> 35:25.916
from a buddy in
New York who said,

35:26.124 --> 35:28.547
was the morning of the
Grammys, it was a Sunday,

35:28.752 --> 35:32.723
<i>it was about 6:30, and my
buddy says there's this guy,</i>

35:32.922 --> 35:34.970
<i>there's an arrest
warrant for him,</i>

35:35.175 --> 35:37.303
L.A. P.D.'s looking for him,
his name is Chris Brown,

35:37.510 --> 35:40.184
and the complaining
witness's name is Rihanna.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.892
He called me, I think it was
maybe an hour or two

35:44.100 --> 35:45.317
after it happened,

35:45.518 --> 35:48.442
and he was, he was scared,

35:48.647 --> 35:50.615
um, like in disbelief,

35:50.815 --> 35:52.567
like he couldn't even believe
this was even going on.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.278
I couldn't believe that.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.079
But he was, you know,
he was scared.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.701
I have been through
a lot in my life,

35:57.906 --> 35:59.533
but that was the most
devastating thing

35:59.741 --> 36:00.913
I've ever had to experience,

36:01.117 --> 36:03.290
to see the hurt and
the pain on his face,

36:03.495 --> 36:05.964
and not knowing what
was gonna happen to him.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.837
<i>[Chris]
I look at it in this,</i>

36:08.041 --> 36:10.135
in this really, like,

36:10.335 --> 36:12.178
how could I be that person?

36:12.379 --> 36:14.677
Well, the case,
originally, was,

36:14.881 --> 36:17.555
an assault with a deadly
weapon, criminal threats,

36:17.759 --> 36:21.309
<i>various charges like that
involving strike offenses</i>

36:21.513 --> 36:23.265
<i>for the serious felonies.</i>

36:23.473 --> 36:27.103
He wanted to, immediately,
take responsibility,

36:27.310 --> 36:28.857
wanted to plead guilty.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.611
Pled guilty,
didn't, didn't argue,

36:31.815 --> 36:35.160
didn't say, "Hey, let me
fight this case and take it

36:35.360 --> 36:38.489
to trial," and just say
"Hey, she fought me back,"

36:38.697 --> 36:41.120
no, I'm not, that's not
where my head was at,

36:41.324 --> 36:43.042
and that's not where it is now,

36:43.243 --> 36:45.120
you know, I loved her,

36:45.328 --> 36:49.253
I wanted to protect her because
I did too much stuff to her.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.630
Like, I did what I did,
so, it was wrong.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.304
<i>Explain quickly, Mark,
what he pled guilty to.</i>

36:54.504 --> 36:56.427
<i>Assault, basically,
is what it is,</i>

36:56.631 --> 36:58.349
<i>a felony assault charge.</i>

36:58.550 --> 37:02.680
The hardest person to see,

37:02.887 --> 37:07.188
or talk about it to would be...

37:07.392 --> 37:10.066
I would say probably my father,
you know what I'm saying,

37:10.270 --> 37:12.318
my father and my,
my real father.

37:12.522 --> 37:14.650
I don't want to
disappoint my father,

37:14.858 --> 37:17.987
because he actually
was there for me.

37:18.194 --> 37:21.368
For my mom, it was a little
bit more closer to heart,

37:21.573 --> 37:24.201
because I seen my mom
deal with that,

37:24.409 --> 37:26.787
you know, firsthand,
not from my father,

37:26.995 --> 37:31.751
my biological father Clinton
Maurice Brown is a great man.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.928
But her significant other
at the time,

37:35.128 --> 37:38.678
my mother's significant
other, he was a monster,

37:38.882 --> 37:41.101
animal, pure hatred, evil,

37:41.301 --> 37:43.804
I've never hated somebody
in my life like,

37:44.012 --> 37:46.982
if I could kill him, I would.

37:47.182 --> 37:51.779
So, I promised my mom one day,
I said, "Look, Ma, you know,

37:51.978 --> 37:55.198
I know you tell me not
to do like crazy shit

37:55.398 --> 37:58.777
and hang with these niggas
and do what I do," I said,

37:58.985 --> 38:01.784
"but when I get 15,
I'm gonna kill him.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.663
Like, I'm not playing, I'm
not not joking, I'm serious.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.244
I wanna take his life."

38:07.452 --> 38:10.126
So, that's the kind of hatred
this guy brings from me,

38:10.330 --> 38:12.708
and fear, and stuff like that.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.338
So, I'm terrified of this man.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.920
I would be at home, you know,

38:17.128 --> 38:19.972
he blew his brains out when
I was six, but he didn't die,

38:20.173 --> 38:21.345
he shot himself in the head,

38:21.549 --> 38:23.392
and then he went blind and shit.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.061
I was six years old, bro, like,

38:25.261 --> 38:27.980
fuck, how does a kid
deal with that shit?

38:28.181 --> 38:31.310
And then, being that he's
physically impaired now,

38:31.518 --> 38:34.067
it frustrates him more,
so he's in a depression,

38:34.270 --> 38:36.944
so, but he takes it out
on his girl.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.401
His girl happens to be my mom.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.111
This is what I had
to deal with, like,

38:41.319 --> 38:43.538
I had to hear my mom
get beat up every night.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.116
I had to pee on myself,
like, I'm scared,

38:46.324 --> 38:47.621
scared to even get up
and walk in the hallway,

38:47.826 --> 38:48.827
'cause I didn't
wanna see nothing.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.082
You know what I'm saying,

38:50.286 --> 38:51.037
so nobody knows the fear

38:51.246 --> 38:52.293
that they had to deal with,

38:52.497 --> 38:55.341
and then it transcends
sometimes,

38:55.542 --> 38:57.636
it's learned behavior.

38:57.836 --> 39:02.387
So, me having to see my mom
look at me through that light,

39:04.467 --> 39:07.767
I just saw him, that's
what I saw, I saw him,

39:07.971 --> 39:11.100
I didn't see Chris,
I seen that motherfucker.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.901
And so, that's what
ate at me, and like,

39:14.102 --> 39:15.399
that's what killed my soul,

39:15.603 --> 39:19.949
because I was the one thing
I was running from.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.277
Sometimes you try to run
away from the one thing

39:22.485 --> 39:26.956
that you don't wanna become,
and you become it.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.705
<i>[Rihanna] The only person
I hate right now is him.</i>

39:29.909 --> 39:31.582
<i>[comedian] The only thing
Chris Brown is guilty of,</i>

39:31.786 --> 39:35.461
<i>-a felony.
-[crowd laughing]</i>

39:35.665 --> 39:37.963
<i>We don't know everything
that went down,</i>

39:38.167 --> 39:39.919
<i>this is a tough one.
You know, he is</i>

39:40.128 --> 39:40.924
<i>in huge trouble.</i>

39:41.129 --> 39:42.506
<i>[woman] We're not
gonna put up with</i>

39:42.714 --> 39:44.933
<i>domestic violence
as business as usual,</i>

39:45.133 --> 39:46.476
<i>and I think we should
just take this</i>

39:46.676 --> 39:47.552
<i>and keep moving with it.</i>

39:47.760 --> 39:49.728
[woman <i>2] We're not saying
I think he should be</i>

39:49.929 --> 39:52.352
<i>thrown in jail, we're saying
he should get treatment.</i>

39:52.557 --> 39:54.559
[Rihanna] <i>It was a weird,
confusing space to be in,</i>

39:54.767 --> 39:59.147
<i>'cause as angry as I was,
angry and hurt and betrayed,</i>

39:59.355 --> 40:02.279
<i>I just felt like...</i>

40:02.483 --> 40:06.363
<i>he made that mistake
because he needed help.</i>

40:08.156 --> 40:11.035
The label,
the name woman-beater,

40:11.242 --> 40:13.791
is something I would
say to somebody.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.123
You know what I'm saying,
it scares me because that,

40:16.331 --> 40:18.925
I would place that
judgment on somebody.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.593
So, when people say it,

40:20.793 --> 40:24.138
I don't get mad at them,
I'm more mad at myself,

40:24.339 --> 40:26.637
because I feel like
I am the reflection

40:26.841 --> 40:28.343
of what they're saying.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.849
To have that type of success
that music brings,

40:31.054 --> 40:33.682
<i>people really look at you
and look to you</i>

40:33.890 --> 40:36.734
<i>for inspiration,
for hope, for light,</i>

40:36.935 --> 40:39.313
for all of these things,
and that pressure can

40:39.520 --> 40:40.942
sometimes be so tremendous.

40:41.147 --> 40:43.320
You are a rock star,
you live in a world where

40:43.524 --> 40:44.901
they want every piece of you,

40:45.109 --> 40:46.952
because they need
to sell a story.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.496
[female reporter] He has <i>said
that</i> he <i>feels really</i> bad

40:48.696 --> 40:50.039
<i>about what transpired,
that he's gonna</i>

40:50.239 --> 40:52.082
<i>meet with his pastor,
and hope to become</i>

40:52.283 --> 40:53.785
<i>a better person,
there are reports he's gone</i>

40:53.993 --> 40:55.495
<i>to anger management classes.</i>

40:55.703 --> 40:57.205
[Mike] <i>Beside that incident,
you know,</i>

40:57.413 --> 40:58.881
<i>it's like
a domino effect,</i>

40:59.040 --> 41:00.713
<i>it brings other
things that happened,</i>

41:00.917 --> 41:02.169
<i>it brings up rage and anger,</i>

41:02.377 --> 41:03.970
<i>and we don't understand
why we angry,</i>

41:04.170 --> 41:05.797
because we're angry
because we think people

41:06.005 --> 41:08.178
think about us in a certain way.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.726
I'm gonna tell you
something, let me be honest.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.894
I was disappointed,
almost felt let down,

41:12.095 --> 41:16.191
because I said, this kid
could be the great superstar.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.859
You say how could I
be the best in the world

41:18.059 --> 41:19.060
and people still talk about me?

41:19.268 --> 41:20.485
And that's just
what life is about,

41:20.687 --> 41:23.907
overcoming emotional
quagmires, adversity,

41:24.107 --> 41:26.075
becoming stronger
in life, you know.

41:26.275 --> 41:29.245
If you didn't experience
any kind of

41:29.445 --> 41:32.289
emotional conflict with
yourself or with anyone else,

41:32.490 --> 41:37.667
under the light of this
struggle, you just crumble.

41:37.870 --> 41:41.465
<i>Sentenced to five years
of probation as you said,</i>

41:41.666 --> 41:45.216
<i>180 days of what Judge Schnegg
calls community labor,</i>

41:45.420 --> 41:49.470
<i>and he has to undergo a
domestic violence program</i>

41:49.674 --> 41:51.142
<i>for one year.</i>

41:51.342 --> 41:52.685
<i>Chris} The first time
I walked in the courtroom,</i>

41:52.885 --> 41:54.558
<i>I was super nervous, you know.</i>

41:54.762 --> 41:57.982
I never even did jury duty,
so I was like,

41:58.182 --> 42:00.401
"Man, I don't know what's
gonna happen here,

42:00.601 --> 42:02.069
I'm not used to
this environment."

42:02.270 --> 42:04.147
This is a guy who's gotten
kind of everything he wanted

42:04.355 --> 42:06.574
since he was 16 years old.

42:06.774 --> 42:10.779
But once you step into a
courtroom, you lose all control.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.955
They wanted me
to do jail time,

42:13.156 --> 42:14.999
there was a lot of
women's rights groups

42:15.199 --> 42:19.705
that were calling in and
demanding that I had jail time.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.664
You know, I was terrified, man,

42:21.873 --> 42:24.467
I was only 17, I think,
about to turn 18,

42:24.667 --> 42:26.385
and I was like, man, like,

42:26.586 --> 42:28.930
I'm about to go to jail, and
just have my life turned out,

42:29.130 --> 42:31.303
I got out of my
situation in Virginia,

42:31.507 --> 42:34.977
and made something of my life,
and I'm going right back?

42:35.178 --> 42:36.054
- Like, that's how I felt.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.605
<i>- This is where
the process begins.</i>

42:37.805 --> 42:39.523
<i>And there has been
speculation already by some</i>

42:39.724 --> 42:43.228
<i>that this really will
end Chris Brown's career.</i>

42:43.436 --> 42:45.029
His drive, his enthusiasm,

42:45.229 --> 42:48.403
his excitement about
everything was gone.

42:48.608 --> 42:53.284
It's hard to go from
that admiration from the world,

42:53.488 --> 42:55.866
to all of a sudden
that judgment from the world,

42:56.074 --> 42:57.576
and being able to balance that,

42:57.784 --> 42:59.957
and understand how to
maneuver through that,

43:00.161 --> 43:01.208
that shit is not easy.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.459
<i>[DJ Khaled] Being on probation</i>

43:02.663 --> 43:03.710
<i>is like the hardest thing ever.</i>

43:03.915 --> 43:05.508
<i>I know that was a tough time.</i>

43:05.708 --> 43:08.131
Any little thing
can be a violation.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.304
I did go into a deep
depression, like I said,

43:10.505 --> 43:12.052
for almost, like, three months.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.054
Stayed in my room,
didn't come out,

43:14.258 --> 43:15.680
they would bring my
food to the door,

43:15.885 --> 43:17.262
my homies would be like,
"Come on man, what's up?"

43:17.470 --> 43:19.564
And I'd just sleep in bed,
stay in bed all day.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.687
Some of the greatest artists
in the world fell,

43:21.891 --> 43:23.108
you know, from that,

43:23.309 --> 43:25.437
and they fall to
substances and things

43:25.645 --> 43:27.693
<i>that just really
cloud their judgment,</i>

43:27.897 --> 43:30.446
<i>cloud their ability to kind
of see their way through it.</i>

43:30.650 --> 43:32.368
<i>Chris} I wasn't sleeping,
I barely ate,</i>

43:32.568 --> 43:35.162
<i>I just was getting high,
I would pop a couple Xanaxes,</i>

43:35.363 --> 43:37.957
<i>drink some lean, then
just be like, "I'm good,"</i>

43:38.157 --> 43:39.784
<i>and be a zombie for
the rest of the day.</i>

43:39.992 --> 43:42.120
<i>I remember being on video
sets and falling asleep,</i>

43:42.328 --> 43:44.456
<i>cussing people out, not
knowing where I'm at, like,</i>

43:44.664 --> 43:45.961
<i>and then I'd wake up
the next day, like,</i>

43:46.165 --> 43:47.257
<i>"Hey, we gotta shoot
the video."</i>

43:47.458 --> 43:49.005
<i>They'd be like, "Dude,
we shot it yesterday.</i> "

43:49.210 --> 43:52.635
<i>I'm like, "dang." So, that's
when I knew it went bad.</i>

43:52.839 --> 43:53.635
And I said, "Hey, man,I'm
not telling you

43:53.840 --> 43:54.682
nothing that ain't
nobody told me,

43:54.882 --> 43:55.974
I'm not telling you
nothing that Quincey Jones

43:56.175 --> 43:57.301
didn't tell me or
Oprah Winfrey didn't tell me,

43:57.510 --> 43:58.636
I'm just telling
you gotta fly away,

43:58.845 --> 43:59.971
like, you know,
do your thing, have fun,

44:00.179 --> 44:02.648
but just always remember
that if the people

44:02.849 --> 44:04.692
that are around you don't
have a risk like you do,

44:04.892 --> 44:07.395
it's probably not,
it's probably,

44:07.603 --> 44:08.980
probably not cool."

44:09.188 --> 44:10.986
The more light we get,

44:11.190 --> 44:13.784
the more we have
to hide our demons.

44:13.985 --> 44:17.831

chair through the window.

54:01.488 --> 54:02.956
I punched the window.

54:03.157 --> 54:06.331
Through my anger, I didn't
know how hard I hit the window,

54:06.535 --> 54:09.539
and it actually shattered,
and I was like, fuck.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.294
I just remember just leaving
the building, I said,

54:11.498 --> 54:13.296
I gotta leave the building
before I do something else.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.968

54:15.169 --> 54:16.011

54:16.211 --> 54:17.087
you got pictures of me with
my shirt off

54:17.296 --> 54:17.888
in the middle of the street,

54:18.088 --> 54:20.432
and, like,
I was crazy, man,

54:20.632 --> 54:23.226
that's like psycho behavior.

54:23.427 --> 54:25.475
I think Chris has gone
to the bottom at some point

54:25.679 --> 54:28.228
in his career, or at
least he's felt that way.

54:28.432 --> 54:30.605
When you're Chris Brown

54:30.809 --> 54:35.610

camera on you at all times.

54:56.919 --> 54:59.513
I definitely think
it's extremely important

54:59.713 --> 55:02.466
to walk away from a
situation before anger

55:02.674 --> 55:04.597
gets the best of you because

55:04.802 --> 55:09.273
everything after that
is a consequence.

55:09.473 --> 55:11.771
You have to focus on
the choices you make,

55:11.975 --> 55:15.070

59:42.496 --> 59:44.794

get him out of the cell.

59:44.998 --> 59:48.093
You get out on, like, the
end of the week for an hour,

59:48.293 --> 59:50.341
you go to the roof and they
will put you in a cage,

59:50.545 --> 59:52.764

with the regular people

59:52.964 --> 59:53.715

59:53.924 --> 59:55.551
you would be in a cage
with a dip bar and a phone.

59:55.759 --> 59:57.352
You understand, I mean,
couldn't sit down,

59:57.552 --> 59:58.804
there was piss, shit, like,

59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.264
people would shit
right on the floor.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.021
It wasn't sanitary,
you know, it was jail,

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:05.899
at the end of the day.
But you had to either adapt,

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:08.856
and kind of learn how to
mentally be content with being

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:13.069
in a stationary one spot,
that was horrible.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.654
But, seeing him chained
to the table was one

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.705
of the most devastating things,

01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.375
to chain his arms up to
the table, and, you know,

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.704
I just, like, it broke my
heart, but I couldn't cry.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.755
I was like,
"He can't see me crying,"

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.674
because I see him,
he come in there like,

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.968
"I'm so happy to see you,
glad to get out of the cell."

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.590
Even with them extraditing me,

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.594
I had to go to court in D.C.
and get on Con Air.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:37.301
I mean, they shackle you
from your hands to your feet

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.102
around your waist and you walk,

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.770
and you walk right in a line,

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.474
and you know, marshals with
real pistols and tasers.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:47.357
The idea that somebody
would be bused by the feds

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.814
cross country for
a misdemeanor case,

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:52.115
was probably unparalleled,

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.818
I mean, it wouldn't be done
absent being Chris Brown.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.994
For me, certain jails
that I went in didn't have

01:00:57.195 --> 01:01:01.666
isolation for, you know,
high class or whatever it is,

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:04.086
so you go into solitary,
you go in the hole.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:06.288
So, I would be in the
hole most of the time.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.715
So, people don't understand
what the hole is.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:12.260
You're in a room with a
metal door and no windows,

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.679
like, metal door,
and you is in the room.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.053
You can touch
both sides of the wall,

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.474
and the bed's metal.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.928
You get a cot, but it's
like, it's nothing,

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:22.979
it's like, thinner
than your sock.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.227
They'll bring you your food,

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.604
slide it through
the door, and that's it.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.310
I would draw
mirrors on the wall,

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.941
just anything, that
I was being creative,

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.489
just keeping my mind going.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.362
I got a chance to really
read the Bible at that time,

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:35.783
I never read the Bible
in my life.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:39.955
I was amazed at the way

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:43.284
he dealt with the
custody time, going to jail.

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:47.041
For me, that was a real big
learning experience for me.

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.748
What I respect about him,
that he weathered the storm.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:53.551

it makes you stronger.

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:12.737
Throughout that time, it just,
it just was an eye opener,

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.781

case number VA353571,

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.409
the defendant is present.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.585
At this time the
court does not find

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.834
any willful violation
of probation.

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:34.795
Probation is ordered
terminated at this point.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:36.376
Anything further?

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.928
Nothing further,
thank you very much.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.426
[Judge] Thank you,
council, we're in recess.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.348
[Chris] Thank you, Your Honor.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.676
[Judge] You're welcome.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.847
[crowd chattering excitedly]

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:50.648
<i>Anything to say, Chris?</i>

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:56.108
I'm off fucking probation!

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:59.282
[excited quiet yelling]

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.530
They terminated my probation,

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.407
I'm a free man,

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.375
I feel great, I don't even
know what to say right now.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:15.502
Probably just gonna
go to the house,

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:18.801
play with my daughter, and,

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.503
figure it out from there.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.463
He is in a spot right now
and in a place right now

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:25.221
that I couldn't
be prouder of him.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.301
The court terminated
his probation today,

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.763
which is a monumental
feat for him.

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:32.144
He's completed everything
that he was ordered to do.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.520
<i>I think he learned quite a bit</i>

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:34.941
<i>while being on probation,</i>

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:37.019
<i>I think it was
instructive for him,</i>

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:39.606
<i>and I think helpful for him,
I couldn't be happier,</i>

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:41.031
<i>and I'm delighted for him,</i>

01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:43.576

celebrate right now.</i>

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:47.155
I think my music
is gonna be my legacy.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:51.709
But what I want the people
to remember me for is my...

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.045
determination,

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:57.248
<i>and I think when
my daughter gets older,</i>

01:12:57.456 --> 01:12:59.299
<i>you know, she'll look
at this, and be like,</i>

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.753
<i>"Man, my daddy CFBZY:
you know?"</i>

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:06.137
<i>But, she'll be proud

<i>You know, the fact
that he's chosen art</i>
