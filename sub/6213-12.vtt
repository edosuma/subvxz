WEBVTT

00:08.675 --> 00:10.878
Hello, everyone.
Thanks for coming.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.145
You know, they say

00:12.145 --> 00:14.648
that an honest politician
is as hard to find

00:14.648 --> 00:17.651
as a quark
in the Triangulan Galaxy.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.821
Trust me,
it's really, really hard.

00:20.821 --> 00:24.358
The man that I'm here
to support, Robert Russell,

00:24.358 --> 00:26.360
is that quark.

00:29.496 --> 00:31.064
Anybody know how
you spell "quark"?

00:31.064 --> 00:32.399
No, but I like
the word, though.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.967
Quark! Quark! Quark!

00:33.967 --> 00:34.535
Put a quark in it.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.536
I'm trying
to take notes.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.271
Sabrina,
this is so exciting--

00:37.271 --> 00:38.839
you getting to write
a big election story

00:38.839 --> 00:39.540
for the newspaper.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.341
Technically I'm not
writing the story.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.209
I'm just taking notes

00:42.209 --> 00:44.278
and bringing a large coffee
order back to the office.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.412
Even better, since I just

00:45.412 --> 00:48.215
raised the price of lattes
to $4.50 a cup.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.317
Well, I don't plan
on delivering coffee forever.

00:50.317 --> 00:51.518
If I could learn
everything there is to know

00:51.518 --> 00:52.619
about Russell's campaign,

00:52.619 --> 00:54.321
then Mike would have
to let me write the story.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.088
Before you know it,

00:55.088 --> 00:56.757
I'll be the paper's
top political pundit.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.458
Pundit! I like it.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.426
Though it's no quark.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.160
ZELDA:
Robert Russell...

01:00.160 --> 01:01.228
is an encyclopedia

01:01.228 --> 01:03.730
on the ins and outs
of local government.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.733
No one is better informed
on the issues.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.571
Is it wrong to vote for someone
just because he's hot?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.172
How do you think
Nixon got elected?

01:12.172 --> 01:14.074
You know, you can only
vote if you're registered.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.243
I'm not registering
until I get married.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.177
Hopefully to him.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.612
Banging on the doors
of the city hall.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.747
Where were all the hunky
politicians when I was young?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.516
Did you ever see a picture
of James Madison?

01:22.516 --> 01:25.252
Yeah, no wonder Dolly was
always making snack cakes.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.453
So, without
any further ado,

01:26.453 --> 01:27.955
I would like
to introduce you

01:27.955 --> 01:30.257
to your next
city councilman

01:30.257 --> 01:32.059
Mr. Robert Russell.

01:32.392 --> 01:33.393
Uh, thank you.

01:33.393 --> 01:34.628
I thank you for
coming out, everybody.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.197
Uh, it's especially
gratifying to have a rally

01:37.197 --> 01:39.700
in the neighborhood
where I grew up.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.134
Of course, that was
before it started

01:41.134 --> 01:43.870
to become gentrified
with exorbitantly high rents,

01:43.870 --> 01:46.139
but, but we haven't
lost the battle yet.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.241
If I'm elected,
I promise to fight

01:48.241 --> 01:50.644
for this district
and protect our citizens

01:50.644 --> 01:52.546
from senseless price-gouging.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.047
I love this guy.

01:54.047 --> 01:57.584
Why should you have to pay
$4.50 for a cup of coffee?

01:57.584 --> 01:59.219
I hate this guy.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.189
Sabrina, there's
your story.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.992
Robert Russell has
a drinking problem.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.962
Well, it doesn't seem to
be hurting his popularity.

02:14.101 --> 02:20.107
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

02:20.107 --> 02:26.647
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

02:26.647 --> 02:29.816
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

02:29.816 --> 02:35.989
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

02:35.989 --> 02:39.493
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

02:39.493 --> 02:44.564
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

02:50.303 --> 02:51.304
Well, according
to this poll,

02:51.304 --> 02:53.607
Russell has 84%
of the vote.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.008
It's no wonder the rest
of the candidates

02:55.008 --> 02:56.043
dropped out of the race.

02:56.043 --> 02:56.810
I'm not surprised.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.245
I mean, after you
see him in person,

02:58.245 --> 03:01.281
you realize why everyone
thinks he's so hot.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.749
I mean,
politically astute.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.785
Objectively speaking,
of course.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.886
Of course.

03:05.886 --> 03:06.820
So you really think
Mike will let you

03:06.820 --> 03:08.422
write a story
about the campaign?

03:08.422 --> 03:09.189
He should.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.824
Nobody knows more
about Russell than I do.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.859
I mean, I know where
he stands on tax rebates,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.294
domestic partner benefits,

03:14.294 --> 03:15.328
even breakfast.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.364
Just juice and coffee.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.199
I guess that's
how he stays so...

03:19.199 --> 03:20.167
Politically
astute?

03:20.167 --> 03:21.868
Yeah, before you start
shmearing his bagel,

03:21.868 --> 03:24.137
you might want to check out
this latest candidate

03:24.137 --> 03:25.038
to join the race.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.107
I think you might know
even more about this one.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.209
Nope. Don't know her.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.777
Isn't your last name Spellman?

03:30.777 --> 03:31.945
Only until I go
to the courthouse

03:31.945 --> 03:32.946
and get it changed.

03:32.946 --> 03:33.980
Sabrina,
why is your aunt

03:33.980 --> 03:35.649
running for
political office?

03:35.649 --> 03:36.416
It's got
to be a joke.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.418
She doesn't know
anything about politics.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.920
She didn't know anything
about coffee.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.189
It didn't stop her
from buying a coffeehouse.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.957
And this woman's running
for city council?

03:43.957 --> 03:45.859
Not as long as there's
breath in my body.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.328
The city must be saved!

03:48.328 --> 03:49.396
Got to go.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.900
Aunt Hilda, why are
you doing this?

03:53.900 --> 03:54.935
I'll tell you why.

03:54.935 --> 03:55.368
Because she knows

03:55.368 --> 03:56.470
how deeply
committed I am

03:56.470 --> 03:57.637
to getting
Russell elected

03:57.637 --> 03:59.506
and she's doing
it for spite.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.173
No.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.675
Spite was when I jammed my feet

04:01.675 --> 04:03.410
into your $300 heels.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.377
I'm running
for office

04:04.377 --> 04:05.679
because someone has to look out

04:05.679 --> 04:07.380
for the good people
of Westbridge.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.049
And that someone is me.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.117
I will not let you
make a mockery

04:10.117 --> 04:12.552
of everything
this country stands for.

04:12.552 --> 04:13.653
That would have sounded
a lot more convincing

04:13.653 --> 04:15.689
if I was wearing a cape.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.058
Somebody has to look out
for the small business owner.

04:18.058 --> 04:18.692
Plus...

04:18.692 --> 04:20.427
Robert Russell publicly stated

04:20.427 --> 04:22.996
that my coffee was
too expensive.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.464
Well, you know
what I'm saying to him?

04:24.464 --> 04:26.166
You're going down!

04:26.166 --> 04:27.467
Aunt Hilda, Robert Russell

04:27.467 --> 04:29.269
is a highly respected member
of the community

04:29.269 --> 04:31.171
with vast experience
in local government.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.640
And you are
a political ignoramus.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.609
With very wide feet.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.612
All right, so I don't know every
little thing about politics.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.846
But I'm a quick study.

04:39.846 --> 04:43.450
And I'm getting the best
consultants money can buy.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.155
Okay, fellas.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.623
What's my
campaign strategy?

04:49.623 --> 04:50.457
You're running?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.958
It'll take four score
and seven years

04:51.958 --> 04:53.226
to get any votes for you.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.495
Even I wouldn't charge
up that hill.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.597
Here's a declaration
of independence.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.399
We're out of here.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.234
Well, you
can't argue

05:01.234 --> 05:02.803
with three
dead presidents.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.271
They're just a bunch
of old fogies.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.873
They don't understand
modern politics.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.476
Today's voters want
a regular person in office.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.844
Somebody just like me.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.512
ZELDA:
A 600-year-old witch.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.481
With a milk mustache.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.317
SABRINA:
Aunt Hilda,

05:17.317 --> 05:18.218
you don't stand a chance.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.620
Robert Russell has 84%
of the vote.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.188
And I'm guessing

05:21.188 --> 05:22.823
no one's going to go
for your campaign slogan

05:22.823 --> 05:24.925
"He dissed me.
Now let's diss him back."

05:24.925 --> 05:27.360
Here's something
that'll sway voters.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.664
"Robert Russell
is an underhanded slimeball."

05:30.664 --> 05:31.498
I knew it!

05:31.498 --> 05:33.099
Salem, you do not go around

05:33.099 --> 05:36.069
making accusations unless you
have something to back them up.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.605
Which is why I've got
something to back it up.

05:38.605 --> 05:41.908
Per Hildy's prodding,
I went out looking for dirt.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.177
And once I finished rolling
around in it,

05:44.177 --> 05:45.345
I observed Russell

05:45.345 --> 05:48.315
with some very shady characters.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.516
Ooh, shady characters.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.017
Sabrina, you wanted
to write a story.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.086
It's been handed to you
on a silver platter.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.654
I can see the
headline now:

05:54.654 --> 05:57.123
"Talking cat sees
shady characters."

05:57.123 --> 05:58.925
Aunt Hilda,
there is no story.

05:58.925 --> 05:59.926
True.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.695
The story's at Russell's house.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.097
And whoever would like
to accompany me there

06:04.097 --> 06:07.567
will see this cat knows
whereof he speaks.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.902
Salem, no one
is going with you

06:08.902 --> 06:10.904
to violate
a man's privacy.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.772
Which plays into my plan
perfectly.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.908
I run with
the unsubstantiated rumor,

06:14.908 --> 06:17.043
and there is no evidence
to dispute it.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.745
I'll drive.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.257
SABRINA:
Oh, yeah, this story's big, all right.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.726
A man reading <i>Cat in the Hat</i>
to his daughter.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.561
I love that book!

06:34.561 --> 06:37.430
So much more accessible
than <i>Hop on Pop.</i>

06:37.430 --> 06:40.433
ZELDA:
Salem, just as I suspected,
this is a total waste of time.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.435
Hardly.
This trash can has some

06:42.435 --> 06:45.038
of the most outstanding
fish heads I've ever eaten.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.040
Ugh!
Let's go home.

06:47.040 --> 06:47.941
(doorbell rings)

06:47.941 --> 06:50.277
Oh, wait!
Something's happening!

06:52.612 --> 06:55.682
Ooh, that's one of the lowlifes
I saw him with earlier.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.018
He's sucking on
the same toothpick.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.552
How gross is that?

06:59.552 --> 07:02.155
This from a guy who eats
fish heads out of a trash can.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.723
I can't see what's going on.

07:03.723 --> 07:04.791
Well, then, we have
to get closer.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.193
But first we have
to get all dolled up.

07:09.529 --> 07:12.799
Wow, I never liked gingham,
but this totally works.

07:12.799 --> 07:13.800
Maybe for you.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.670
My bloomers are
stitched to my waist.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.738
Time to accessorize.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.183
Oh, my gosh.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.852
Robert Russell is buying votes.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.088
All right, Stan.
You know the drill.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.524
Deliver this to the
appropriate constituents,

07:37.524 --> 07:39.960
and not a word about
who they're from.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.227
And, um...

07:41.227 --> 07:42.862
Listen, tell Louie to be here
tomorrow night.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.531
I have some money
for his people, too, all right?

07:44.531 --> 07:48.635
Salem was right!
He is a slimeball!

07:48.635 --> 07:50.470
( <i>wailing</i> )

07:50.470 --> 07:51.805
Aunt Zelda, I know
you're disappointed,

07:51.805 --> 07:53.540
but don't cry.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.141
I can't help it!

07:55.141 --> 07:58.244
I'm a Baby-Cries-A-Lot.

07:58.244 --> 07:59.546
Be thankful you're not
a Wendy-Wee-Wee.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.781
My bladder's about to burst.

08:01.781 --> 08:02.449
Let's get out of here.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.718
I've got to get this tape
down to the newspaper before...

08:04.718 --> 08:07.120
Mama! Mama!

08:09.756 --> 08:10.757
I could have sworn

08:10.757 --> 08:13.026
I heard these two dolls
having a conversation.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.094
( <i>wailing</i> )

08:14.094 --> 08:17.263
Got to go wee-wee.
Got to go wee-wee.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.168
There goes <i>that</i> diaper.
( <i>sighs )</i>

08:25.505 --> 08:26.840
JOSH:
Hey, this footage
is amazing.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.441
It's like there's
actually a camera

08:28.441 --> 08:30.043
inside Russell's house.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.412
Sabrina, how did you know
this was even going on?

08:32.412 --> 08:34.414
A cat
tipped me off.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.316
And I'm jiggy
with that, man.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.252
MIKE:
Hold on,
I know this guy.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.353
We ran a piece on him

08:40.353 --> 08:42.889
when he was convicted
for selling stolen TVs.

08:42.889 --> 08:43.690
Hey, you're right!

08:43.690 --> 08:45.358
Crazy Larry!

08:45.358 --> 08:45.892
No, no, wait.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.194
Crazy Larry's was the
store he stole them from.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.329
Forget Crazy Larry.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.432
Why is Robert Russell
giving money to an ex-con?

08:52.432 --> 08:53.466
I'll tell you why.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.868
Because he's buying votes.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.536
But maybe it goes beyond that.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.872
Maybe this guy is Russell's link

08:58.872 --> 09:01.307
to a wide network
of shady dealings.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.209
I mean, maybe what seems
like a local scandal

09:03.209 --> 09:04.711
really involves the whole city.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.345
The state!

09:05.345 --> 09:05.912
And who knows?

09:05.912 --> 09:08.882
Maybe even
an international cover-up.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.917
Hey, it could happen.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.385
You've still got
a huge story.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.355
The most popular
and supposedly
upstanding politician

09:15.355 --> 09:16.723
in the district
is a crook.

09:16.723 --> 09:17.390
MIKE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.626
You're getting <i>way</i> ahead
of yourselves.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.495
We don't print word one
until I interview Russell.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.064
Once I get his side
of the story,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.965
then you can start writing.

09:26.599 --> 09:27.734
Call me crazy,

09:27.734 --> 09:30.370
but that doll is a dead ringer
for your Aunt Zelda.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.771
No way.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.740
That doll has a butt.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.446
"Would-be Councilman
Bankrolls Ex-Con.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.115
Russell Responds
with No Comment."

09:42.982 --> 09:43.983
Wow.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.086
Even in grainy
black and white,

09:46.086 --> 09:48.254
he's totally hot.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.622
So sad.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.491
There are no heroes left.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.559
You know what
you need, Zellie?

09:52.559 --> 09:54.427
A new hero.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.262
And a tetanus shot!

09:56.262 --> 09:57.263
Hi.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.032
And here's <i>my</i> hero!

09:59.032 --> 10:00.266
Oh, Sabrina,

10:00.266 --> 10:01.201
I am going to be

10:01.201 --> 10:02.669
Westbridge's new
councilwoman,

10:02.669 --> 10:04.204
and it's all
because of you.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.572
Aunt Hilda, I wrote that article

10:05.572 --> 10:07.340
because people have
a right to know the truth,

10:07.340 --> 10:08.341
not to help someone

10:08.341 --> 10:10.076
who's completely
unqualified for the job.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.012
Geez, learn to take
a compliment, will you?

10:13.012 --> 10:14.547
So, Sabrina, if Russell
won't comment,

10:14.547 --> 10:15.648
what do you suppose he's hiding?

10:15.648 --> 10:17.417
I can't stand it.
I don't want to know.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.586
Which works out well
because I don't have a clue.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.021
Isn't it your
job to find out?

10:22.021 --> 10:24.457
Yes, but I can't do anything
until I finish my shift here.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.360
Oh, don't you worry your pretty
little head about that, missy.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.262
You go and take all
the time you need.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.063
And don't come back

10:30.063 --> 10:32.132
until you've completely
destroyed that man.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.068
Oh, and take a muffin.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.007
♪ ♪

10:41.007 --> 10:42.208
That must be Louie.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.178
Time to find out
where that cash is headed.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.282
Wow, I am so money.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.593
Whew!

11:00.593 --> 11:02.996
Next time I get an envelope
with a window.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.697
Okay, let's see what kind
of sleazy little scheme

11:04.697 --> 11:06.132
I'm being used for.

11:06.132 --> 11:07.734
Thank you so much.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.169
I've been out of work
for three months

11:09.169 --> 11:11.371
and I didn't know
how I was going to pay my rent.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.174
Perhaps "sleazy" was a bit
of an overstatement.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.608
Where did this money come from?

11:15.608 --> 11:16.409
The giver wishes

11:16.409 --> 11:17.510
to remain anonymous,

11:17.510 --> 11:20.747
but I can tell you this:
he's a saint.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.449
Great, I just wrote a scathing
article about a saint.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.385
He's more than a saint.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.586
He's an angel.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.155
And I just lopped off his wings.

11:32.725 --> 11:33.860
Come on, kids.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.197
We can finally stop
ducking the landlord.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.132
Well, as much as I'd like
to be used for rent,

11:39.132 --> 11:41.334
I have a man's reputation
to save.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.304
Okay, I'll just talk to Mike,
you know?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.305
Get him to print a retraction.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.907
I mean, he'll understand.
He's...

11:48.675 --> 11:50.443
Hey, it's Ben Franklin Day

11:50.443 --> 11:52.912
down at, uh,
Gorlick/Davis Motors.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.248
We're clearing the lot,
so come check out all the deals.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.051
First 50 people through the door
get a free kite.

11:59.686 --> 12:02.755
Well, I just downloaded
the latest polls.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.024
Let me see.
Let me see!

12:05.024 --> 12:07.160
Cases of asthma are up 17%.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.428
Even higher in my family.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.763
The political polls.

12:10.763 --> 12:11.764
Oh, no.

12:11.764 --> 12:12.232
I'm down.

12:12.799 --> 12:13.733
Way, way down.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.169
Oh, up!

12:16.169 --> 12:18.171
I'm way, way up!

12:18.705 --> 12:20.506
Russell's not buying votes.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.641
He's giving money to the poor.

12:21.641 --> 12:22.709
You have to run
a retraction.

12:22.709 --> 12:23.943
I can't run
a retraction.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.279
First off, you didn't
bring me any proof.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.114
Secondly, I just got off
the phone with Russell.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.282
He still says no comment.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.183
I don't get it.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.285
He's doing incredibly
generous things for people.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.886
Yeah, why would he want
to hide that?

12:33.886 --> 12:35.255
Gee, that is a good question.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.756
You know,
if I wanted the answer,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.858
I wonder who could get it
for me.

12:38.858 --> 12:39.592
Let's see,

12:39.592 --> 12:40.994
this is a newspaper.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.196
Perhaps somebody wants
to be a reporter.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.964
Sabrina, do you know
anybody like that?

12:44.964 --> 12:46.132
What about me?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.202
Oh.
You meant me.

12:49.202 --> 12:49.669
Go.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.304
Go, go, go, will you?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.408
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

12:57.443 --> 12:58.578
Hi. May I help you?

12:58.578 --> 12:59.779
Hi. You don't know me.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.947
Well, you
kind of know me.

13:00.947 --> 13:01.914
Well, you probably
know my name--

13:01.914 --> 13:02.915
Sabrina Spellman?

13:02.915 --> 13:05.952
I wrote that article
in the <i>Boston Citizen.</i>

13:07.186 --> 13:09.422
Look, I know you're
really a good guy

13:09.422 --> 13:10.390
and you're giving
all that money to the poor,

13:10.390 --> 13:13.359
but why are you
trying to hide it?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.428
Why would I tell you
of all people?

13:15.428 --> 13:17.563
Because I unfairly
damaged your reputation

13:17.563 --> 13:18.831
and now I just want to help you.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.667
But I can't help you
unless you let me.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.634
Help you.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.670
This isn't helping, is it?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.807
Why don't you come on in?

13:28.941 --> 13:30.510
Look...

13:30.510 --> 13:32.478
The reason I wasn't
completely forthcoming

13:32.478 --> 13:34.013
was because I was
afraid the media

13:34.013 --> 13:37.417
would spin
the news unfairly.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.951
You mean, like they already did?

13:38.951 --> 13:40.153
They being me.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.455
Me being really sorry.
Did I mention that?

13:42.455 --> 13:45.525
Sabrina, I gave
the money anonymously

13:45.525 --> 13:47.126
because I wanted
to help families

13:47.126 --> 13:49.162
and give them a second chance.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.532
But I didn't want people to
think that I was buying votes.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.566
Makes sense to me.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.101
And if you go
on record with that,

13:55.101 --> 13:57.437
I'm sure I can clear
this whole mess up.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.771
Fine, I'll go on record.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.506
But I'm not going to give you

14:00.506 --> 14:02.408
the names of the families
I've been helping out.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.210
I want to respect their privacy.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.246
Hey, if there's one reporter who
understands respecting privacy,

14:07.246 --> 14:08.514
it's me.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.016
Starting now.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.786
"Russell says money
was gift for the poor."

14:13.786 --> 14:15.021
Excellent work, Sabrina.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.356
I knew he was innocent.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.457
And now everybody does.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.559
The playing field
is once again level.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.128
Okay, here's
the latest poll.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.663
Jennifer Lopez,
still hot.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.999
Robert Russell,
still... not.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.569
I'm running against
Jennifer Lopez?

14:29.569 --> 14:31.371
I don't believe this.
After everything I did

14:31.371 --> 14:34.040
to try to redeem this man,
people still think he's guilty.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.209
It's a lot easier
to destroy a reputation

14:36.209 --> 14:38.478
than it is
to build one back up.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.947
I'm still trying to convince
people that nothing happened

14:40.947 --> 14:43.649
between me and Magellan
on that ship.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.852
Mike Magellan.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.654
Catamaran salesman,
Nantucket.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.491
I feel so bad
for Russell.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.359
I wish there was something
that I could do.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.794
You and me both.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.829
You could start
by registering to vote.

14:56.829 --> 14:57.196
( <i>sighing</i> )

14:57.196 --> 14:58.664
Okay.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.299
How much do I owe you?

15:00.299 --> 15:01.267
It's free.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.335
Oh!

15:02.335 --> 15:05.538
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.474
There's got to be a spell

15:08.474 --> 15:10.443
that will restore
Russell's reputation.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.611
Here's one!

15:11.611 --> 15:12.845
"To clear the air
and show he's great,

15:12.845 --> 15:15.047
put him in a public debate."

15:15.648 --> 15:17.884
Sabrina, I just had
the craziest idea!

15:17.884 --> 15:19.886
Let's set up a debate
between Hilda and Russell,

15:19.886 --> 15:21.888
and I can broadcast it
on my radio show.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.122
That is crazy.

15:23.122 --> 15:26.426
So crazy it just might work.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.998
Testing, check,
check, check...

15:31.998 --> 15:34.567
( <i>feedback blares</i> )

15:34.567 --> 15:36.469
That's why we check.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.906
This debate is exactly
what Russell needs.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.308
When people see how passionate
he is about the issues,

15:42.308 --> 15:44.177
they'll be convinced
of his integrity.

15:44.177 --> 15:44.911
All I can say is,

15:44.911 --> 15:46.045
I wouldn't want
to be Aunt Hilda

15:46.045 --> 15:47.079
going up against him.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.080
She must be shaking

15:48.080 --> 15:49.582
in your $700 boots
right now.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.783
What?

15:52.051 --> 15:52.985
( <i>sighing</i> )

15:52.985 --> 15:53.920
I'm glad
you're both here.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.055
Okay, here's a joke
I thought I'd open with.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.558
A priest, a rabbi,
and Camryn Manheim

15:58.558 --> 15:59.759
walk into a bar...

15:59.759 --> 16:02.628
Like I said, we got
nothing to worry about.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.132
What do I think
about multi-use rezoning?

16:06.132 --> 16:07.133
I like it.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.069
Rezoning, recycling,
refried beans.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.938
Remember me
when you go to the polls.

16:11.938 --> 16:12.972
(chuckles)

16:13.539 --> 16:15.675
Working like
a charm, Sabrina.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.476
Yup, I know.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.977
Like taking candy
from a baby.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.111
Next question.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.514
If this district is awarded
additional federal funds,

16:21.514 --> 16:23.449
how would you use them?

16:23.449 --> 16:24.450
Mr. Russell?

16:24.450 --> 16:25.518
As I've said all along,

16:25.518 --> 16:27.119
our district's most
immediate needs

16:27.119 --> 16:29.956
are with our elderly care
and after-school programs.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.491
And you, Ms. Spellman?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.292
Whatever it was he said.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.394
Ms. Spellman, so far
you haven't told us

16:35.394 --> 16:37.096
any of your views on anything.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.197
Of course not.

16:38.197 --> 16:39.765
I'm a politician.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.033
Ba-dum-bum!

16:42.301 --> 16:44.937
That may have been the final
nail in her political coffin.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.240
Ms. Spellman, our audience
expects to hear answers

16:47.240 --> 16:48.574
to these serious questions.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.610
I'll give you
a serious question.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.978
Mr. Russell, I would
like to know

16:51.978 --> 16:54.080
who these so-called
poor people are

16:54.080 --> 16:57.083
that you are supposedly
giving money to.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.217
I can't tell you that.

16:58.217 --> 17:01.020
I have to respect
their privacy and anonymity.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.488
How convenient.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.324
Unfortunately, if you want
to be a public official,

17:05.324 --> 17:07.527
your public is entitled
to know everything.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.061
Entitled to know
everything?

17:09.061 --> 17:11.531
Sabrina, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.732
I'm way ahead of you.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.333
That is, if we're
thinking the same thing.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.269
I'm not going to
embarrass these families.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.504
I'd rather resign
from the race.

17:18.504 --> 17:20.673
Well, I'm not
going to debate that.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.276
I have a question
for one of the candidates.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.878
We're not taking questions
from the audience tonight.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.613
Although here's
a crazy idea:

17:27.613 --> 17:28.781
why not?

17:29.315 --> 17:30.917
Ms. Spellman, you say the public

17:30.917 --> 17:33.653
is entitled to know everything
about its elected officials.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.122
Exactly.
So, what you're saying is,

17:36.122 --> 17:38.457
if you were elected
to city council,

17:38.457 --> 17:40.393
your private life
would be an open book.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.327
Absolutely.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.129
So, then you're okay
with the public knowing...

17:43.129 --> 17:45.064
let's say... how old you are?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.766
I have no problem with that.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.000
27.

17:48.634 --> 17:49.602
( <i>chuckling</i> )

17:49.702 --> 17:51.571
Ms. Spellman,
would you be willing

17:51.571 --> 17:54.240
to share with the public
your complete personal history?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.943
For instance, where
were you brought up?

17:56.943 --> 17:58.878
Don't make me play
the Magellan card, Zellie.

17:58.878 --> 17:59.645
( <i>sighing</i> )

17:59.645 --> 18:00.780
Catamaran salesman.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.415
We just had dinner.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.849
How about where
you went to high school?

18:03.849 --> 18:05.318
Or where you bought
your toaster?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.353
Or how you ended up
with that cat?

18:07.353 --> 18:08.354
Okay, I get the point.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.156
The public doesn't
need to know anything...

18:10.156 --> 18:11.157
about anything.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.292
Now, can we please
get back to the issues?

18:13.292 --> 18:13.826
Fine.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.361
How do you feel
about tort reform?

18:15.361 --> 18:17.964
Oh, tort sounds great right now.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.132
A little ice cream
on the side...

18:21.367 --> 18:23.169
Okay, I'm 30.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.406
Aunt Zelda, I think
our work here is done.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.975
According
to this latest poll,

18:28.975 --> 18:32.078
Russell is back to his
original 84% of the vote.

18:32.078 --> 18:32.845
However, when asked

18:32.845 --> 18:34.981
"With which candidate would
you rather play Twister?"

18:34.981 --> 18:37.383
99% said Hilda.

18:37.383 --> 18:40.219
Well, that woman is
a demon on all fours.

18:40.219 --> 18:40.853
So, have you
thought about

18:40.853 --> 18:42.488
what you're going
to write next?

18:42.488 --> 18:44.190
Yeah, I have.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.558
My resignation.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.026
What?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.327
Well, I almost
destroyed a man

18:48.327 --> 18:49.061
and I'm only an intern.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.396
Imagine the damage
I would do

18:50.396 --> 18:51.797
if I became
a full-fledged reporter.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.934
Hold on, you're being
way too hard on yourself.

18:54.934 --> 18:55.835
I ran that story

18:55.835 --> 18:58.504
because I thought it was
the right call at the time.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.973
Sometimes you do
make mistakes.

19:00.973 --> 19:01.540
There's nothing
you can do

19:01.540 --> 19:03.309
but go home and
cry like a baby.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.310
Is that what you do?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.679
No, but I'm guessing
you might.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.349
Look, Sabrina, if you
really want to quit,

19:10.349 --> 19:13.786
I guess I can't stop you.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.655
Yes, I can.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.889
You're good at this.

19:16.889 --> 19:17.857
Don't be an idiot.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.191
Now get back to work.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.326
I guess I have no choice.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.327
No.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.395
Well, then I guess

19:22.395 --> 19:23.863
I should start thinking
about my next story.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.731
Um, this time I want
to do something

19:25.731 --> 19:27.400
really uncontroversial.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.701
Like, maybe, the dog show.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.069
Uncontroversial?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.070
Are you joking?

19:31.070 --> 19:32.838
You write something nice
about the Chihuahuas,

19:32.838 --> 19:35.508
the Corgi coalition
gets on your tail.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.509
So, what you're saying is,

19:36.509 --> 19:38.711
no matter what I write,
I'm going to offend somebody.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.512
Mm-hmm.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.047
And when you get
to be as good as I am,

19:41.047 --> 19:42.815
you can do it
without even writing.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.421
We have the final tally
in the city council race:

19:48.421 --> 19:54.026
Robert Russell: 12,782 votes;
Hilda Spellman: one.

19:54.593 --> 19:55.628
Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Hilda.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.296
At least you voted for yourself.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.931
Actually I didn't vote.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.901
I couldn't
find parking.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.803
Well, there's one
voter out there

20:03.803 --> 20:05.337
who believed in
what you stood for.

20:05.337 --> 20:06.772
There's been a correction.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.641
A vote has just been
disqualified.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.677
Election officials have found
that a paw print was substituted

20:11.677 --> 20:14.346
in place of an actual signature.

20:14.346 --> 20:17.783
Hey, you try holding a pen
with just a dewclaw.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.251
That makes the final tally

20:19.251 --> 20:24.090
Russell: 12,782;
Spellman: zero.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.058
It's a total shutout.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.927
That's awful.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.328
Well, look at it
this way, honey.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.363
You were a lot
funnier than Russell.

20:31.363 --> 20:31.997
You're right.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.599
And that's going to be
my ace in the hole

20:33.599 --> 20:35.301
when I run for governor.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.169
Who's up for
a game of Twister?

20:43.442 --> 20:44.710
Hey, Mike, great.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.845
I'm glad I caught you.

20:45.845 --> 20:46.712
Got news for you,
Sabrina.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.514
I'm not that tough
to catch.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.982
Well, I finally did it.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.350
I wrote
the perfect article.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.351
It's current, it's precise,

20:52.351 --> 20:54.420
and it offends
absolutely no one.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.888
"Suburban subdivision...

20:55.888 --> 20:57.690
"Streetlights added...

20:57.690 --> 21:00.993
"Neighborhood watch
doing their job...

21:00.993 --> 21:04.463
Bake sale
an unqualified success."

21:04.463 --> 21:05.164
Well?

21:05.164 --> 21:07.500
You're right: no one could
possibly be offended by this.

21:07.500 --> 21:11.437
I knew it.
And I know just
what to do with it.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.338
Well, what if I include

21:12.338 --> 21:13.939
the fight over who had
the best brownies--

21:13.939 --> 21:15.541
the nuts lady
or the no-nuts lady?

21:15.541 --> 21:16.375
You're nuts, lady.
Good-bye.
