WEBVTT

00:03.103 --> 00:05.472
Well, it looks like
everything's in order.

00:05.472 --> 00:08.075
All my chemicals are
perfectly balanced.

00:08.075 --> 00:10.644
Let the cloning begin.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.486
An exact duplicate.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.621
Eureka!

00:20.621 --> 00:22.022
I'm a genius!

00:22.022 --> 00:23.924
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:23.924 --> 00:25.692
Probably the Nobel Committee.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.728
Hello?

00:27.728 --> 00:28.962
Hi, whatcha doing?

00:28.962 --> 00:32.766
Just replicating a sequence
of deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.967
You're cloning?

00:33.967 --> 00:36.136
Wow, I'm so proud
to have you as my aunt.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.138
I mean,
you're not only brilliant

00:38.138 --> 00:39.740
you're beautiful, kind

00:39.740 --> 00:42.242
and you're very, very,
very special to me.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.610
How much money do you need?

00:43.610 --> 00:44.811
How much can you clone?

00:44.811 --> 00:46.113
Cloning money is illegal.

00:46.113 --> 00:47.981
But the sky's the limit
with produce.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.516
How are you fixed for melons?

00:49.516 --> 00:51.184
Mmm, tomato.

00:51.184 --> 00:55.889
They say the antioxidants are
good for the prostate and...

00:58.258 --> 01:00.427
( <i>chuckles</i> )

01:00.427 --> 01:01.528
Huh?

01:04.431 --> 01:10.604

and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:11.038 --> 01:16.777

01:43.804 --> 01:45.038
Sabrina, I'm
not paying you

01:45.038 --> 01:46.840
to make goo-goo eyes
at the customers.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.675
Oh, I've been meaning
to bring that up

01:48.675 --> 01:49.810
at a staff meeting.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.445
Hey, it's not my
fault you never

01:51.445 --> 01:53.113
get to spend any
time with Josh.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.681
Who told him to leave his job

01:54.681 --> 01:57.484
at the coffeehouse to go work
at some dead-end newspaper?

01:57.484 --> 01:59.419
Okay, I got to go, Sabrina.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.221
The "dead-end newspaper"

02:01.221 --> 02:03.323
is sending me
to photograph the <i>Pope.</i>

02:03.857 --> 02:06.793
Yeah, but does
the paper give
you free lattes?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.195
He didn't get that here, either.

02:08.195 --> 02:10.030
Listen, Mike's giving me
Wednesday night off

02:10.030 --> 02:11.431
and I promise,
we'll be together.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.633
Wednesday sounds good.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.900
Wednesday it is.

02:14.334 --> 02:15.669
Bye-bye!

02:16.670 --> 02:19.039
Harvey, what happened
to you?

02:19.039 --> 02:20.273
Just a little hockey injury.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.609
Which he got
while scoring

02:22.609 --> 02:24.244
the game-winning goal
for Boston College.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.013
Harvey's the star
of the team.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.348
And I'm the star's girlfriend.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.851
And I'm going to hurl.
I'll see you Wednesday.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.053
We'll do whatever you want.
I don't care what it costs.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.721
Oh, you don't have to spend
a cent on me

02:34.721 --> 02:37.024
as long as we're together.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.525
That's a sentence

02:38.525 --> 02:40.994
you will never,
ever hear me say.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.897
Hey, Sabrina, can I talk
to you for a minute?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.232
Sure, what's up?

02:45.232 --> 02:46.333
I need your help.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.068
This ankle injury's
pretty serious.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.603
I'm afraid
if Coach finds out

02:49.603 --> 02:51.805
I'll wind up on the bench
for the season.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.708
Well, I'm not an orthopedic
surgeon, Harvey

02:54.708 --> 02:56.910
but, hey, if you're
up for it...

02:56.910 --> 02:58.111
Actually, I was hoping

02:58.111 --> 03:00.080
that you could do
that thing that...

03:00.080 --> 03:01.248
that only you can do?

03:01.248 --> 03:03.183
Turn the world on
with my smile?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.584
Oh, wait, that's Mary.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.421
I'm talking about magic.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.822
Sabrina, I'm desperate.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.590
We've got a big game
coming up

03:10.590 --> 03:12.392
and the team's
counting on me.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.460
Harvey, I'm
not allowed

03:13.460 --> 03:15.062
to give my magic
away to mortals.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.263
I'm a witch,
not a genie.

03:16.263 --> 03:17.631
Oh.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.733
You wouldn't happen to know
any genies, would you?

03:19.733 --> 03:22.102
Only one, but she's
having a little problem

03:22.102 --> 03:24.304
with the bottle, if
you catch my drift.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.306
Sorry, Harvey, my
fingers are tied.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.542
Well, it was worth
a shot.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.377
But I'll tell
you what, if you
go see a doctor

03:30.377 --> 03:32.646
and get it taken
care of, I promise
I'll be at the game

03:32.646 --> 03:34.614
and I'll bring everyone
I know to cheer you on.

03:34.614 --> 03:35.649
That would be great.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.883
See you Wednesday night.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.518
Wednesday night.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.854
I'm sure Josh won't mind
spending our date

03:40.854 --> 03:43.290
cheering on my ex-boyfriend.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.859
My first night
off in two weeks

03:45.859 --> 03:48.662
and I'm supposed
to cheer on your
ex-boyfriend?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.063
I hardly even know Harvey.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.432
I hate hockey,
and she still dragged me here.

03:52.432 --> 03:53.800
I've got bigger problems.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.968
Every sporting
event I go to

03:54.968 --> 03:57.637
I get hit in the
head by something.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.206
There can be 60,000 people
in a stadium

03:59.206 --> 04:00.941
and no matter where
I'm sitting

04:00.941 --> 04:03.043
the puck or the ball--
or the matador--

04:03.043 --> 04:05.245
comes flying up and
hits me in the head.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.513
Will you shut up already?

04:06.513 --> 04:08.281
Although, it usually
doesn't kick in

04:08.281 --> 04:09.850
until the game
actually begins.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.917
Guys, stop complaining.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.519
Harvey's playing through
an injury

04:12.519 --> 04:13.887
and we're here
to support him.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.256
Yeah, anything for
your ex-boyfriend.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.992
Who happens to be
my current boyfriend.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.228
I'm dating number ten.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.496
He's the star.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.564
Two Salems can drive

04:24.564 --> 04:26.833
Ninny and the Professor
twice as crazy

04:26.833 --> 04:28.869
and we can be
kings of this castle.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.570
You've got beauty
and brains

04:30.570 --> 04:33.373
which means,
so do I.

04:34.641 --> 04:35.976
Hmm...

04:35.976 --> 04:37.477
Salem, what have you done?

04:37.477 --> 04:38.879
Me? Nothing.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.947
I've just been
sitting here

04:40.947 --> 04:43.617
grooming myself,
as cats will do.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.718
Hmm...

04:44.718 --> 04:46.520
Must've been the wind.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.822
I think you owe me an apology.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.457
I'm sorry, Salem.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.392
I'll let it go this time.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.895
Wait a minute.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.163
What wind?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.765
This could be
the beginning

04:58.765 --> 05:00.801
of a beautiful
friendship.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.003
I like the way
I think.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.371
Oh, there goes Harvey!

05:04.371 --> 05:06.406
He's driving
toward the goal!

05:08.375 --> 05:10.710
And he gets the puck
stolen from him.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.212
Thief!

05:15.048 --> 05:15.982
Oh, there goes Harvey!

05:15.982 --> 05:16.883
He's wide open!

05:16.883 --> 05:18.185
He's getting ready to shoot!

05:20.687 --> 05:22.556
And he trips
and falls... again.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.292
The beauty of ice
is that after you fall on it

05:25.292 --> 05:27.794
you can use it
to bring down the swelling.

05:27.794 --> 05:28.862
Oh, he's back up!

05:28.862 --> 05:30.063
You know what they say--

05:30.063 --> 05:31.598
you can't keep
a good man down.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.766
Ooh! Or Kinkle up.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.968
This is so humiliating.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.603
Oh, Harvey'll bounce back.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.604
I meant for me.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.773
I'm his girlfriend.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.808
It looks like the coach
is benching him.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.644
Wow, I've never seen anyone
fall off the bench before.

05:44.644 --> 05:47.581
Let's hope they keep him benched
for the rest of the season.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.984
This is exactly
what Harvey was afraid of.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.520
Hey, Kinkle! You stinkle!

05:54.688 --> 05:57.591
Oh, man, even I'm
feeling sorry for the guy.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.892
Oh, poor Harvey.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.360
I just don't understand.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.030
I mean, just last week
he was skating like a god.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.967
Skating? God?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.268
That's it.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.269
Uh, I'll be right back.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.171
I've got to get
more relish for my sausage.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.706
I'll get it for you.
No, no, no, no!

06:12.706 --> 06:14.941
I am very particular about
the relish on my sausage.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.344
If there's too much relish,
it can overpower a sausage.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.880
If there's not enough,
it can... underpower it.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.282
Do you give this much thought
to all your condiments?

06:22.282 --> 06:24.651
Don't get me started
on horseradish.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.952
I know what she means.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.154
I'm convinced the cause of
my Uncle Buddy's death

06:28.154 --> 06:29.155
was Aunt May's relish.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.091
Not that Uncle Buddy
didn't have it coming.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.425
Thank you!

06:33.927 --> 06:35.028
Hi, Mercury, I'm...

06:35.028 --> 06:36.229
Eh, eh, eh...

06:36.730 --> 06:38.865
Now, I'm sorry about
your late delivery, Minerva

06:38.865 --> 06:41.201
but the traffic around
Mount Olympus is a nightmare.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.203
( <i>sarcastic chuckle</i> )

06:43.203 --> 06:44.905
She may be the goddess of wisdom

06:44.905 --> 06:47.307
but she has got a mouth
like a chariot driver.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.309
I'm sorry to bother you,
but my ex-boyfriend

06:49.309 --> 06:51.177
is playing in a big
hockey game right now

06:51.177 --> 06:52.279
and he's got
this ankle injury

06:52.279 --> 06:53.346
and the coach
has benched him

06:53.346 --> 06:54.547
and I was wondering
if you had

06:54.547 --> 06:56.383
a pair of really fast
ice skates I could borrow.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.452
And you are the goddess
of what, run-on sentences?

06:59.452 --> 07:01.588
Actually, I'm not a goddess--
I'm a witch.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.556
Well, actually,
half-witch, half-mortal.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.991
Well, how about
those skates?

07:04.991 --> 07:06.459
I only have one pair.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.662
I've never lent
them out before.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.731
Well... you can have them
for three virgins.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.033
Oh, and a goat.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.501
Would you settle for

07:14.501 --> 07:17.737
a foot-long Polish sausage
with extra kraut?

07:17.737 --> 07:20.473
Oh, you found
my Achilles heel!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.510
That's the one thing
you can't get up here.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.813
Oh, just be sure and bring
them back within 24 hours.

07:26.813 --> 07:27.681
Oh, well, that's
how long it should take

07:27.681 --> 07:29.416
for that sausage
to back up on you.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.588
Harvey, put these on.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.790
Where'd these come from?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.124
Don't ask questions.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.259
Just do as I say.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.761
Suddenly I feel like
we're dating again.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.230
I need these back first thing
tomorrow morning, got it?

07:44.230 --> 07:46.166
Got it, thanks.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.368
I knew I could count on you.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.471
You are the greatest.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.139
Whoa.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.641
I thought you were
somebody else.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.842
Really sorry.

07:55.842 --> 07:59.145
Want to get some coffee
after the game?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.719
Wayne is really going to love
my impromptu little dinner.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.754
Don't you think
the president
of the college

08:07.754 --> 08:09.489
deserves something
a little classier

08:09.489 --> 08:11.891
than bologna
and Ding Dongs?

08:11.891 --> 08:13.893
Did you not notice
the Cheez Whiz?

08:13.893 --> 08:15.962
I stand corrected.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.099
So, you and Zelda's boss?

08:19.099 --> 08:23.003
Frankly, if I were Zelda,
I'd be a wee bit upset.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.672
If you were Zelda,
I'd be suicidal.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.840
There, all done.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.241
I just have
to run upstairs

08:28.241 --> 08:30.310
and get a blanket
for us to snuggle on.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.545
Oh, what was I thinking?

08:32.545 --> 08:34.347
There's no way I'm
leaving you alone here

08:34.347 --> 08:35.448
with all this food.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.983
( <i>sobbing</i> )

08:44.924 --> 08:46.226
Hilda?

08:48.428 --> 08:50.497
Oh, my goodness!

08:50.497 --> 08:53.700
It looks like we've been
pillaged by the Huns again.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.469
Zelda Spellman,
how could you?

08:56.469 --> 08:58.304
How could I what?

08:58.304 --> 09:01.007
Just because you're jealous
because I'm dating your boss

09:01.007 --> 09:03.743
doesn't give you the right
to destroy my romantic dinner.

09:03.743 --> 09:07.313
Obviously this was the work of
a fiendish four-legged feline.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.915
I don't think so, Zelda.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.117
Salem was with me
the whole time.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.087
I can't believe you think
I would do something so petty

09:14.087 --> 09:18.324
just because I'm jealous,
which I absolutely am not.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.227
For once in
your 658 years

09:21.227 --> 09:23.329
will you own up
to your real feelings?

09:23.329 --> 09:25.632
All right, you want
real feeling, sister?

09:25.632 --> 09:26.933
I'll give you real feelings.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.968
I think President Banning
is out of his mind

09:28.968 --> 09:30.170
to be going out with you.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.738
Oh, yeah? Well, who asked you?

09:31.738 --> 09:32.539
You did!

09:32.539 --> 09:34.140
Sure, throw that in my face.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.543
Oh, no, missy, you opened up
this can of worms

09:36.543 --> 09:38.078
and we're going
to finish it!

09:38.078 --> 09:39.879
( <i>chewing loudly</i> )

09:40.313 --> 09:43.516
Now that's
entertainment, hmm?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.786
ANNOUNCER:
Goal for Boston College!

09:46.786 --> 09:48.321
Ladies and gentlemen, a new
single game scoring record

09:48.321 --> 09:51.224
has just been set
by Harvey Kinkle!

09:51.224 --> 09:52.425
That's my boyfriend!

09:52.425 --> 09:53.693
ALL:
We know!

09:53.693 --> 09:56.296
I've never seen someone
skate so fast before.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.998
Call me crazy, but I think
he's really flying.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.066
Oh, no, no!
He's just jazzed

10:00.066 --> 10:01.668
because we all showed up
to cheer him on!

10:01.668 --> 10:03.303
You know, he never
played like this

10:03.303 --> 10:05.438
before I was
his girlfriend.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.242
Yeah, well, if you're
his girlfriend

10:09.242 --> 10:10.376
why is he waving at mine?

10:10.376 --> 10:12.078
Oh, he's not waving at me.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.547
He's just... trying
to get the vendor.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.283
Uh, get that guy some nuts!

10:21.187 --> 10:22.388
Hi, Harvey.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.557
Still flying high
after last night's game?

10:24.557 --> 10:26.359
It was the most exciting
night of my life

10:26.359 --> 10:27.494
and I owe it all to you.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.229
Oh, what are friends for?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.331
I mean, I'm sure
you would've done
the same thing for me.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.465
You know, if
you were a witch.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.501
I brought you
a little present.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.070
Oh, it's beautiful!

10:37.070 --> 10:39.072
But you really didn't
have to get me anything.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.941
Oh, yes, I did.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.376
The coach was
so impressed

10:43.376 --> 10:45.044
with my performance
last night

10:45.044 --> 10:46.913
he took the skates
from my locker

10:46.913 --> 10:48.615
and secretly
had them bronzed.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.883
It's a real honor.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.518
It's a real disaster
is what it is.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.253
I borrowed these skates
from Mercury

10:53.253 --> 10:55.855
and the last thing you want
to do is make a god angry.

10:55.855 --> 10:59.025
Wow, I was wearing
a god's skates?

10:59.025 --> 11:00.660
That is so cool.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.062
Okay, I don't think you get
what's at stake here.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.565
Um, does the name Prometheus
mean anything to you?

11:05.565 --> 11:08.668
He's the guy who
stole fire from Zeus.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.837
And wound up chained to a rock
for all eternity

11:10.837 --> 11:12.539
with vultures
pecking out his liver!

11:12.539 --> 11:15.041
We've got to get
those skates
out of there!

11:16.509 --> 11:19.245
Wait! No need to destroy
school property.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.950
I keep forgetting
you can do that.

11:23.950 --> 11:27.353
Now the important part:
un-bronzing them.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.725
Well, so much for
saving school property.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.060
What are we going to do?

11:34.060 --> 11:37.263
All I know is, no bird
is getting near my liver!

11:43.937 --> 11:46.005
They're bronzed!

11:46.005 --> 11:47.473
Consider it a gift.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.509
You don't have
to thank me.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.778
I won't, because I have no use
for bronzed skates.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.680
Can't you just unbronze them?

11:53.680 --> 11:54.480
Could you?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.582
No, but I'm just a witch.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.583
You're a god.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.219
Have you ever heard
of a god of un-bronzing?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.521
Isn't he the one
who brought us sunscreen?

12:01.521 --> 12:03.289
Look, Blondie,
you're in big trouble.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.891
You ruined
my only pair of skates

12:04.891 --> 12:07.493
and now you're going
to have to pay the consequences.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.195
No, please don't peck
out my liver.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.396
I have midterms in two weeks

12:10.396 --> 12:12.665
and it's really hard to study
without a vital organ.

12:12.665 --> 12:13.633
Save it for Zeus.

12:13.633 --> 12:14.867
Punishments are
his specialty.

12:14.867 --> 12:17.870
Dottie, can you get
Zeus for me?

12:22.041 --> 12:24.677
Thanks, Dottie,
and I'll need another desk.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.380
Who am I punishing today?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.582
Her. I loaned her my
only pair of skates

12:29.582 --> 12:30.650
and she ruined them.

12:30.650 --> 12:31.651
It was an accident.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.619
You see,
I borrowed them

12:32.619 --> 12:34.520
for my ex-boyfriend.
We have a lot of history.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.122
Anyway, his team was losing
the game

12:36.122 --> 12:37.290
and he was injured, so...

12:37.290 --> 12:38.524
Quiet!

12:40.059 --> 12:42.362
And that's why he gets paid
the big bucks.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.164
Young lady, destroying
the property of a god

12:45.164 --> 12:46.566
is a serious offense.

12:46.566 --> 12:50.903
And it is my pleasure...
I mean, duty

12:50.903 --> 12:53.072
to come up with an appropriate
punishment.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.141
Um, I don't mean
to be pushy, Zeus

12:55.141 --> 12:56.843
but isn't it also
the duty of a god--

12:56.843 --> 12:59.178
especially you,
the king of gods--

12:59.178 --> 13:00.346
to be merciful?

13:00.346 --> 13:02.015
Mercy's a wonderful concept

13:02.015 --> 13:04.717
but I find it gets
in the way of punishment.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.519
Since I'm
the injured party...

13:06.519 --> 13:08.454
Oh, oh...
Uh, Great God of Gods.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.223
May I be so bold as to suggest

13:10.223 --> 13:12.792
that she make all my deliveries
for a month?

13:12.792 --> 13:16.996
Well, I suppose
that would be more
fitting than...

13:16.996 --> 13:18.765
throwing her in a pit

13:18.765 --> 13:22.101
and letting the wildebeests
feast on her?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.236
Way more fitting.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.408
Would it kill him
to use a door once in a while?

13:30.877 --> 13:32.111
I understand the shoes

13:32.111 --> 13:34.314
but do I have to wear
this hideous hat?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.182
It was a birthday gift
from Zeus's wife.

13:36.182 --> 13:36.983
I love it.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.052
Here's your beeper.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.454
And deliver this package
to Apollo.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.889
Is this the only one?

13:42.889 --> 13:45.091
No. It's the only one
I could lift.

13:47.960 --> 13:48.895
( <i>sighs</i> )

13:48.895 --> 13:50.363
If anyone needs me

13:50.363 --> 13:52.632
I'll be snorkeling
at Club Med Atlantis.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.703
And I'll be here drowning
in a sea of cardboard.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.810
Package for
Mr. Narcissus?

14:03.810 --> 14:04.777
Sign here, please.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.640
Okay, I've got to write
the psychology paper

14:34.640 --> 14:36.042
and then I've got to deliver

14:36.042 --> 14:37.910
this Mother's Day basket
from Oedipus.

14:37.910 --> 14:41.247
Hmm, if only I could write
about that.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.716
Pan? Pan?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.417
Pan!

14:44.851 --> 14:47.720
Message from your condo
association:

14:47.720 --> 14:49.222
"Learn a new freakin' song."

14:50.056 --> 14:51.657
Hey, don't shoot the messenger!

14:54.427 --> 14:56.562
JOSH:
Sorry I missed you again.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.464
You know,
your phone also dials out.

14:59.065 --> 14:59.899
Josh? Josh, wait!

15:00.266 --> 15:01.033
Hello?

15:01.934 --> 15:04.837
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

15:04.937 --> 15:07.507
"And wear flippers"?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.041
Now, what's that about?

15:18.217 --> 15:21.387
Oops. My mistake.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.863
Josh, what are you doing here?

15:30.863 --> 15:33.132
I just wanted to see
what's up with you.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.401
I mean, whenever I call,
you're never...

15:35.401 --> 15:36.602
What are you wearing?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.271
Is that seaweed
in your hair?

15:38.271 --> 15:39.572
Oh, I'm going
for a new look.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.141
I'm sorry I haven't called you.
It's been a god-awful week.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.443
Hey, I'm busy,
too, all right?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.478
But at least I find time
to return your calls.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.479
We haven't talked

15:46.479 --> 15:48.281
since you dragged me
to Harvey's game.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.149
Sabrina, is there
something going on
with you two

15:50.149 --> 15:51.350
you're not telling me about?

15:51.350 --> 15:54.053
Josh, you know that's not true.
Why would you even think that?

15:54.053 --> 15:56.789
( <i>knocking</i> )

15:57.790 --> 15:58.891
Hey, Sabrina

15:58.891 --> 16:00.960
just wanted to thank you
again for last night.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.994
Oh, Harvey, not now.

16:01.994 --> 16:05.031
Hey, Josh, didn't
see you there.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.065
Obviously.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.333
Um, I can explain.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.134
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

16:08.134 --> 16:09.869
Uh, as soon as I get back.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.537
Got to go.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.309
Girl can wear anything,
can't she?

16:16.509 --> 16:17.777
You have been
jealous of me

16:17.777 --> 16:19.579
since the day I came
out of the womb.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.880
How can I be
jealous of you

16:20.880 --> 16:22.248
when you have
nothing I want?

16:22.248 --> 16:24.217
Except the president
of your college.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.085
I do not want
President Banning.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.054
I do, however,
want the pearl earrings

16:28.054 --> 16:30.756
which were stolen
from my jewelry box
this morning.

16:30.756 --> 16:32.425
Are you accusing me
of stealing?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.126
I'm merely saying that
they are missing

16:34.126 --> 16:35.795
and you're the only one
in the house.

16:35.795 --> 16:36.963
I don't know which is worse

16:36.963 --> 16:39.198
you thinking that I would steal
your pearl earrings

16:39.198 --> 16:41.267
or you thinking that I would
actually wear them.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.703
Do I look
like Sandra Day O'Connor?

16:44.904 --> 16:47.039
The stealing's
a nice touch.

16:47.039 --> 16:50.643
Nothing you wouldn't have
thought of yourself.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.145
And may I say
you look stunning?

16:53.145 --> 16:55.281
Pearls and basic black?

16:55.281 --> 16:57.316
A timeless classic.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.684
I am getting out
of here.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.286
I can't stand
this anymore.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.287
Oh, and I can?

17:01.287 --> 17:03.055
Fine. If you're
taking the car

17:03.055 --> 17:04.557
drop me at my president's house.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.691
I will not!

17:05.691 --> 17:07.727
Fine. Then I'm
taking the car.

17:07.727 --> 17:08.761
Fine. Then drop me

17:08.761 --> 17:10.897
at my younger, better-looking
boyfriend's house.

17:10.897 --> 17:14.667
Fine. But I'm not
slowing down the car.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.004
( <i>both chuckle</i> )

17:18.004 --> 17:20.940
( <i>music playing</i> )

17:20.940 --> 17:23.843
Just like you to
forget your keys.

17:26.612 --> 17:27.780
( <i>music stops</i> )
BOTH:
HEY!

17:27.780 --> 17:29.348
Ever hear
the expression

17:29.348 --> 17:31.517
"Double your pleasure,
double your fun"?

17:31.517 --> 17:32.885
Ever hear the expression

17:32.885 --> 17:34.287
"You're in deep doo-doo"?

17:34.287 --> 17:35.321
( <i>both groan</i> )

17:37.290 --> 17:39.025
Cool hat.
Could you get me one of those?

17:39.025 --> 17:40.593
Uh, no. Where's Josh?

17:40.593 --> 17:41.594
He left.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.496
I'm afraid he's
upset with me.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.697
You think he knows

17:44.697 --> 17:47.099
we have all these secrets
between us?

17:47.099 --> 17:48.768
Oh, you mean, like,
that you know I'm a witch

17:48.768 --> 17:50.937
and I lent you magical skates
and now I'm moonlighting

17:50.937 --> 17:52.138
as a messenger for Mercury?

17:52.138 --> 17:53.239
Yeah, that.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.141
I should probably go talk
to him

17:55.141 --> 17:57.243
but I've got to go
to Rite Aid for Apollo.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.378
You know, you'd think
he'd be able to find

17:59.378 --> 18:01.047
some Grecian Formula in Greece.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.482
Hey, this whole thing
is my fault.

18:03.482 --> 18:06.018
Is there any way
at all I can help?

18:06.018 --> 18:08.054
Not unless you can
figure out a way

18:08.054 --> 18:09.722
I can be in two
places at once.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.357
You're a genius, Harvey.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.061
Never see that coming.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.166
BOTH:
I'm telling you
it was his idea!

18:20.166 --> 18:21.167
I'm innocent!

18:21.167 --> 18:22.902
You shut up!
No, you shut up!

18:22.902 --> 18:23.970
BOTH:
You shut up!

18:23.970 --> 18:25.037
BOTH:
You both shut up!

18:25.037 --> 18:26.639
This is scary.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.840
Hello, Sabrina.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.842
What are you doing here?

18:29.842 --> 18:31.277
You know your cloning machine?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.713
Obviously Salem does.
I need to borrow it.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.880
Too late.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.682
We just smashed it
to smithereens.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.384
This is so
not my day.

18:38.384 --> 18:39.418
( <i>pager beeps</i> )

18:39.418 --> 18:41.988
Does everyone in the world
but me have a beeper?

18:41.988 --> 18:43.889
This actually belongs
to Mercury.

18:43.889 --> 18:45.725
Mercury? Didn't you
used to date him?

18:45.725 --> 18:46.792
Don't remind me.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.427
When he took off
those sandals

18:48.427 --> 18:50.062
ugh, talk about
a mood killer.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.864
I have to do all his work
for a month

18:51.864 --> 18:53.866
'cause I ruined
his only pair of skates.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.268
Only pair of skates?

18:56.268 --> 18:58.938
I give you
Mercury's closet.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.942
Complete with an entire section
devoted to skates.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.244
Whoa. How did you know
these were here?

19:05.244 --> 19:08.481
You think I'd date
a guy without snooping
through his closets?

19:08.914 --> 19:11.484
Hey, my pink pumps.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.419
They look nice
with wings.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.487
Sabrina, Hilda

19:14.487 --> 19:15.755
what are you doing here?

19:15.755 --> 19:19.258
You picked the wrong
witch's niece to pick on.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.593
Yeah, you're busted,
flyboy.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.129
Why did you tell me you only
had one pair of skates?

19:23.129 --> 19:26.198
'Cause he's a lazy,
conniving, pink pump pilferer

19:26.198 --> 19:29.535
who still hasn't discovered
Odor Eaters.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.270
I'll tell you
one thing.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.005
Zeus is going to have
a great time punishing you

19:33.005 --> 19:34.540
when he finds out
about your little scam.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.574
Yeah.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.576
Hey, there's no reason
we can't keep this

19:37.576 --> 19:40.012
amongst the three of us.

19:41.781 --> 19:45.117
I believe someone here's
in need of a punishment.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.086
And another desk.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.888
Which I am more
than happy

19:48.888 --> 19:51.123
to pay for out
of my own pocket.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.292
Good luck skating
your way out of this one.

19:53.292 --> 19:54.126
Ha-ha.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.895
Thanks, Aunt Hilda.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.797
You know, it really
helps having aunts

19:57.797 --> 20:00.266
who dated every
male life-form in
the solar system.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.967
Not every, but we're
working on it.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.937
I know I'm not supposed
to use my magic to help mortals

20:04.937 --> 20:06.539
but I felt so bad for Harvey

20:06.539 --> 20:08.140
I just couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.142
Your heart was in
the right place, Sabrina.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.844
I can't tell you
the number of times

20:11.844 --> 20:14.547
I've wanted to use my finger
for the good of all mankind.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.748
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

20:16.348 --> 20:17.850
It's Josh.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.552
As you say, honey, got to go.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.959
Josh, I'm so glad
you're here.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.395
Are you? Are you sure
you wouldn't rather be

20:29.395 --> 20:31.063
with someone else
like Harvey?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.699
Josh, nothing's going on
between Harvey and me.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.134
I don't know
how many times

20:35.134 --> 20:36.535
I have to tell you that.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.037
I just wish
you would trust me.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.205
I want to trust you.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.940
I just feel like
you and Harvey

20:40.940 --> 20:42.742
are sharing some
sort of secret.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.643
Harvey and I have
a history together.

20:44.643 --> 20:45.778
I can't erase my past.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.948
But the important thing
is you're my future.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.550
So you're saying
there's nothing

20:51.550 --> 20:53.219
I have to worry
about here?

20:54.720 --> 20:57.356
Not a thing.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.664
I'm the real
Salem Saberhagen.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.733
And who am I,
Joey Lawrence?

21:07.733 --> 21:08.734
Don't worry.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.803
We have an absolutely
foolproof method

21:10.803 --> 21:13.372
to determine which
Salem will stay with us.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.641
Lucky for me
she's a scientist.

21:15.641 --> 21:16.942
Hilda?

21:17.276 --> 21:18.844
Eeny meenie minie moe

21:24.517 --> 21:27.720
Thank God you picked
the right one.

Although, I miss me.
