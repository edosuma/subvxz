00:07.530 --> 00:09.760
I love when they serve
grilled cheese sandwiches.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.560
It's so much better than
yesterday's angel hair pasta.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.910
Yeah, I wish Angel would wear a hair net.

00:18.740 --> 00:21.610
Well, at least you can't mess
up a grilled cheese sandwich.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.560
Don't be so sure.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.560
Mine's not grilled,
there's no cheese on it,

00:26.590 --> 00:27.700
and it's not bread.

00:29.930 --> 00:30.670
It's just two dry sponges.

00:33.740 --> 00:35.600
I'm going to complain to Angel.

00:39.810 --> 00:43.520
Uh, Lexi?
You have a cleaver in your head.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.320
I'm surprised you didn't notice,

00:45.340 --> 00:46.850
given how much you look in the mirror.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.790
It's not real.

00:51.820 --> 00:55.790
I'm a Cleaver Head.
A fan of the band Blood Butcher.

00:55.830 --> 00:59.730
You little kids don't know who they are.

00:59.770 --> 01:02.640
Please.
I know all about Blood Butcher.

01:02.970 --> 01:06.610
They're a band.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.610
Their fans are called Cleaver Heads.

01:09.650 --> 01:11.880
Little kids don't know who they are.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.720
Oh, so I guess I'll see
you at their concert

01:14.750 --> 01:16.620
Friday night at Toxic Wasteland.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.560
Oh, you'll see us at Toxic Wasteland!

01:22.590 --> 01:24.700
We practically live at Toxic Wasteland!

01:27.730 --> 01:30.670
So, what is Toxic Wasteland?

01:30.700 --> 01:34.570
It's that scary Goth store downtown!

01:34.610 --> 01:35.910
Why would you tell her we're going there?

01:35.940 --> 01:37.710
To fit in!
Don't you want to fit in?

01:38.950 --> 01:41.580
No!

01:41.620 --> 01:42.720
If I wanted to fit in, do you really
think I'd eat lunch with Angus?

01:43.850 --> 01:45.790
Yeah!

01:46.960 --> 01:49.920
I'll go to the concert with you, Chyna.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.760
Toxic Wasteland is right next
door to Fat Leganzo's Pizzeria.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.930
One of their pizza toppings
is smaller pizzas!

01:57.940 --> 02:00.700
Well, Angel gave me another sandwich.

02:02.710 --> 02:04.710
It pays to speak up.

02:58.940 --> 03:01.940
Hey, Lexi, you're into
Blood Butcher, right?

03:01.970 --> 03:03.940
Big time.

03:03.980 --> 03:06.650
Hardcore Goth-death-punk is my
third favorite type of music.

03:07.880 --> 03:12.590
Right after pop-country
and Armenian reggae.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.590
Well, would you told youssed if I

03:14.620 --> 03:15.960
I scored two tickets to their concert?

03:16.720 --> 03:17.890
No.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.560
All you did was
and hit print.puter.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.700
Those tickets were free.

03:22.700 --> 03:23.930
No, they weren't.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.900
My dad charges me to use the printer.

03:29.670 --> 03:30.870
You know what I really want?

03:30.910 --> 03:32.870
To get backstage and meet the band.

03:32.910 --> 03:34.640
I can do that.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.840
You? How?

03:36.880 --> 03:38.750
There are two things I'm good at.

03:38.780 --> 03:40.850
Getting people backstage to meet bands,

03:40.880 --> 03:44.820
and making promises I can't keep.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.890
But if I get you backstage,
do something for me.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.630
And I think you know what I want.

03:51.660 --> 03:54.800
Fine. I'll let you
in the cafeteriatable

03:54.830 --> 03:55.760
every Wednesday for a week.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.930
Every Wednesday for a week?

04:00.940 --> 04:01.970
Sweet!

04:06.940 --> 04:09.880
Your mom's never going to let you
see a band called Blood Butcher.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.850
She's ridiculously
over-protective.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.680
No, she's not.

04:14.690 --> 04:16.690
All right.
Let.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.660
What?

04:24.700 --> 04:26.700
There are earthquakes in San Francisco.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.700
Let's just check out their website.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.670
Maybe Blood Butcher
isn't as scary as they sound.

04:38.910 --> 04:41.610
That's just the pop-up
ad for shampoo.

04:41.780 --> 04:44.980
I know, but it popped up so suddenly.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.890
The name of their new single
sounds innocent enough.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.930
It's called
<i>Sundays With Grandma.</i>

04:52.960 --> 04:56.760
<i>♪ Punch, punch, punch,</i> <i>punch

05:10.780 --> 05:13.680
Man! I guess Grandma's lucky
they only visit once a week.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.850
What was that horrible sound?

05:17.850 --> 05:18.850
Oh! Oh, that?

05:18.890 --> 05:22.620
That was just
Angus doing a sit-up.

05:23.920 --> 05:24.960
Show her, Angus.

05:44.950 --> 05:46.080
Anyway, Mom,

05:46.110 --> 05:49.650
I was wondering if I could
see a concert Friday night?

05:49.680 --> 05:50.720
What's the name of the band?

05:51.820 --> 05:54.620
Oh, uh, they're called...

05:54.650 --> 05:55.960
The Happy Fuzzy Friends!

05:56.890 --> 05:59.790
They sound like a little kids' band.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.960
Yeah, they sound like a little kids' band.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.700
They are!
But they're really good.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.800
You should check out their website.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.740
Okay, I'll go do that right now.

06:10.810 --> 06:13.570
Okay, you do that.
Bye.

06:13.610 --> 06:13.940
See you later.

06:13.980 --> 06:17.680
Love you.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.550
Why would you say they're
a little kids' band?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.680
And why would you say they have a website?

06:22.720 --> 06:23.590
What kind of band wouldn't have a website?

06:23.620 --> 06:25.650
A band that doesn't exist!

06:29.860 --> 06:32.630
Angus! Could you please kill the power
before she gets to her computer?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.600
Sure.
Good.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.740
I meant in the house,
not in the entire world.

06:48.910 --> 06:50.750
I'm not a mind reader.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.890
Come on, we got to get the
Happy Fuzzy Friends website up

06:58.920 --> 06:59.960
before my mom gets home
from work and goes online!

06:59.990 --> 07:02.820
Don't rush me!

07:02.860 --> 07:04.890
These things can't be done with
just the push of a button!

07:04.930 --> 07:08.600
Okay, done.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.830
All right, I drew a picture of the
Happy Fuzzy Friends to upload.

07:14.770 --> 07:17.810
Here's Sharkelope,
Turtleurkey, Porcupotamus,

07:17.840 --> 07:20.610
and Octopanda.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.810
Octopanda?
Where did that come from?

07:23.850 --> 07:27.920
Well, Olive, when an octopus and a
panda decide to start a family,

07:27.950 --> 07:30.620
they're visited by the storknausaraus.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.890
So, Angus, you scan this in and
I'll record a song sample.

And a good message, Angus.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.830
Hey, you asked for a website.

08:11.860 --> 08:14.600
Now, you want it fast or
do you want it with pants?

08:24.740 --> 08:27.680
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find the manager?

08:27.710 --> 08:29.650
If I knew that, don't you
think I'd tell the cops

08:29.680 --> 08:30.710
and get the reward?

08:31.920 --> 08:33.850
I'm the assistant manager.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.720
The name's Sunshine.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.890
Seriously?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.760
I was wondering if I could get
a couple of backstage passes

08:44.800 --> 08:45.830
to the Blood Butcher concert?

08:46.760 --> 08:47.900
Forget it.

08:47.930 --> 08:50.670
The backstage area is our storeroom.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.800
And the place I go to meditate

08:52.840 --> 08:55.910
on my relationship with Cthulhu,

08:55.940 --> 08:58.780
Dark Lord of the Underworld!

09:00.810 --> 09:02.680
Sunshine?

09:02.710 --> 09:05.550
You don't have, like, a
middle name you could go by?

09:05.580 --> 09:08.520
Look, the backstage is employees only.

09:08.550 --> 09:09.890
So, if we're done here,

09:09.920 --> 09:12.560
I have to go pierce the nose of
a lost, middle aged divorcee

09:12.590 --> 09:15.660
who thinks a metal stud is
going to fill that empty void.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.890
Sunshine!

09:17.930 --> 09:18.730
Coming, Mom!

09:18.760 --> 09:20.730
Relax!

09:29.940 --> 09:31.810
Good news.
The power's up and

09:31.840 --> 09:34.610
we are able to go online again.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.580
Oh. Didn't notice.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.550
Seems like you grownups are
obsessed, almost hypnotized,

09:39.580 --> 09:41.650
by the world wide web.

09:43.690 --> 09:45.620
I checked out the Happy
Fuzzy Friends website

09:45.650 --> 09:46.860
and they seem perfectly harmless.

09:47.660 --> 09:50.660
So can I go to the concert?

09:50.690 --> 09:52.630
Yup, and I'm coming with you!

09:52.660 --> 09:52.730
What?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.700

Well, you should.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.850

Easy! We get an octopus,
we get a panda,

11:05.280 --> 11:07.280
put on a little romantic music

11:07.320 --> 11:07.980

The gestation period of

11:17.130 --> 11:19.230

I'll record the music

11:27.100 --> 11:29.010

12:31.130 --> 12:32.270
All right!

12:32.300 --> 12:34.040
Maybe I'll start tomorrow.

12:34.070 --> 12:36.100
I'll just hang out here tonight

12:36.140 --> 12:37.300
and check out the storeroom.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.270
You know, see where you keep your

12:39.310 --> 12:41.980
tattoo machine.

12:42.310 --> 12:44.050
Not so fast.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.310
I need you to work a shift now.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.320
In fact, here's your first customer.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.290
He wants a tattoo on his back.

12:59.030 --> 13:01.030
Shouldn't he take off that sweater, too?

13:01.060 --> 13:02.200
That's not a sweater.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.140
Where's Chyna?

13:09.170 --> 13:11.910
We can't perform without our lead singer.

13:11.940 --> 13:14.070
She's going solo already?

13:14.110 --> 13:15.040
She's nothing without us!

13:16.280 --> 13:18.910
Hey, guys.

13:18.950 --> 13:21.080
Oh. Well, look who
came crawling back.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.990
The Happy Fuzzy Friends are
playing at this place?

13:28.020 --> 13:29.990
Why do all these kids have
cleavers in their heads?

13:31.230 --> 13:33.300
Oh!

13:33.330 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, well, that's...

13:36.030 --> 13:38.100
That's just because the Happy
Fuzzy Friends have this song,

13:38.130 --> 13:39.130
and it's called.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.270
<i>Don't Play</i>

13:42.310 --> 13:43.970

Man, every one of their songs is good.

14:17.310 --> 14:20.140
This is cute.

14:20.180 --> 14:21.240
I'm going to buy it for your Nana.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.250
It says,
"Sundays With Grandma!"

14:24.280 --> 14:25.250
Oh, this is good.
You like it?

14:25.280 --> 14:27.950
Yeah.

14:27.990 --> 14:28.020
Excellent!

14:31.990 --> 14:32.920
Okay, let's do this.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.290
Olive, did you bring the costumes?
Check.

14:34.330 --> 14:37.260
Angus, did you bring the instruments?
Check.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.230
Fletcher, did you call
Blood Butcher's people

14:38.260 --> 14:40.300
and tell them the gig was canceled?

14:40.330 --> 14:41.060
Check.

14:44.140 --> 14:47.940
Fletcher, that's Blood Butcher!

14:47.970 --> 14:49.270
You just said check!

14:49.310 --> 14:53.280
Yeah, I meant I need to
check my to-do list, and...

14:53.310 --> 14:55.010
I did not do it.

15:03.350 --> 15:05.290
We cannot let Blood Butcher
get on that stage.

15:05.320 --> 15:10.030
Don't worry. You and Fletcher
just get our costumes ready.

15:10.060 --> 15:11.260
What are you two going to do?

15:11.290 --> 15:13.330
Yeah, what are we two going to do?

15:15.060 --> 15:16.070
Go shopping.

15:24.310 --> 15:28.240
Hey, guys.
I'm the manager, Rainbow.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.180
And I'm the assistant manager, Lollipops.

15:35.190 --> 15:37.120
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

15:37.150 --> 15:39.290
And not the good kind of bad news

15:39.320 --> 15:41.090
like an impending apocalypse.

15:49.300 --> 15:53.070
I was really hoping
the first time I shaved,

15:53.100 --> 15:54.170
it would be my face.

15:59.210 --> 16:02.210
Okay, it's tattoo time.

16:02.410 --> 16:05.110
What would you like?

16:05.150 --> 16:08.250
May I suggest something
simple and tasteful,

16:08.280 --> 16:09.350
like...

16:11.150 --> 16:12.250
The moon.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.230
Or...

16:17.130 --> 16:18.030
The sun.

16:19.230 --> 16:21.170
Or if you're feeling adventurous,

16:24.340 --> 16:26.040
a circle.

16:30.240 --> 16:36.080
Or a Tyrannosaurus Rex
surfing on a sea of blood

16:36.120 --> 16:38.320
and in its tiny little arms, a rose.

16:40.190 --> 16:42.120
Could he be standing behind the moon?

16:46.030 --> 16:48.130
Ooh, scented candles.

16:49.230 --> 16:51.200
Ugh, this smells like death.

16:51.230 --> 16:52.400
What scent is this?

16:53.370 --> 16:55.330
"Death."

16:57.370 --> 17:00.170
And they also have
"Vanilla death."

17:11.319 --> 17:14.190
Nice! How did you get
Blood Butcher to leave?

17:14.220 --> 17:17.020
We just told them there's
been a change of venue.

17:17.060 --> 17:19.020
Let's see how <i>Punch

17:19.060 --> 17:21.160

Friends, let's suit up.

17:24.359 --> 17:27.200
Yeah. Finally things
are back on track.

17:27.230 --> 17:29.100
Yeah, I don't think so!

17:29.140 --> 17:32.070
Look at these backstage snacks!

17:32.100 --> 17:35.010
I specifically requested macaroons.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.380
Where are my blasted macaroons?

17:46.220 --> 17:49.150
Excuse me. I'm looking for a
guy that's not very smart,

17:49.190 --> 17:52.290
really desperate, and about yay high.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.990
Why?
You're blonde and pretty.

17:57.030 --> 18:00.100
You could do better than that.

18:00.130 --> 18:03.070
By the way, I hate you because
you're blonde and pretty.
