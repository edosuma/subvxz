WEBVTT

02:10.339 --> 02:13.467
Hey. It's okay.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.718
I hate this fucking place!

02:56.802 --> 02:58.512
Oh, shit.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.436
Let's get the fucking monkey
and get out of here, bro.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.026
We need to be home before five.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.192
He's asleep.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.404
What happened?
I mean, why did he sink the trawler?

06:02.487 --> 06:05.115
Does he know what we're doing, Ma?
I don't think he does.

06:05.199 --> 06:11.038
I don't. I mean… how could he?

06:13.332 --> 06:14.333
He knows.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.838
Man.

06:24.635 --> 06:25.677
Slept like the dead.

06:26.970 --> 06:32.643
Haven't slept like that in years.
Must be the clean air.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.856
Honey. You wanna give me
and your mom a second here?

06:38.482 --> 06:39.483
Sure.

06:54.331 --> 06:58.043
It wouldn't have worked.
You didn't have enough fuel.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.214
I had enough to get us away.
That's all I needed.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.761
Let's say that you and Dina
didn't run out of gas

07:07.845 --> 07:13.642
in the middle of nowhere,
didn't die of thirst or starvation,

07:13.725 --> 07:18.897
or run into someone
that might exploit that situation.

07:19.481 --> 07:25.737
Or you get across Mexico,
cross the border into the United States.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.031
So, now what?

07:29.533 --> 07:30.534
You tell me.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.416
You're about to, right?
I mean, try stopping you.

07:38.792 --> 07:44.256
What happens is, is you get arrested
and spend the rest of your life in prison.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.508
Charlie? He gets extradited to Mexico.

07:48.927 --> 07:49.928
That's the best case.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.306
That was your plan, right?

07:53.974 --> 07:57.311
Gonna take Dina with you.
Gonna take Charlie.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.940
You're goddamn right, I was.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.489
You don't wanna stay here with me.

08:10.199 --> 08:15.412
You're being impulsive, and you're not
thinking through the consequences.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.291
Not for yourself
and certainly not for the kids.

08:19.374 --> 08:25.380
I would've turned myself in.
And the kids, they would've been fine.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.840
I know what I'm doing.

08:26.924 --> 08:30.469
You would've lasted a week in the US,
and you burned that bridge.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.179
Well, aren't you the voice of reason.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.058
I just wanna keep everyone safe.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.602
You wanna keep everyone together.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.813
You wanna make this a home,
whether we like it or not.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.526
And you expect us to be happy about it.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.446
But you can't compel people
to be happy, Allie.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.867
And you can't make a home
by putting a fence around it.

08:54.451 --> 08:59.331
This is not a home.
It's a detention center.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.501
And I'm not gonna change your mind
about that. Not here.

09:07.756 --> 09:11.844
Why don't you give it a try?
I mean, I could use a laugh.

09:16.265 --> 09:19.226
I guess what I'm saying is,
is if you're gonna leave me,

09:20.894 --> 09:22.771
I know I can't stop you.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.648
But please wait.

09:24.731 --> 09:30.779
At least until I know
that you have formulated a realistic plan.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.972
The iguana first?

09:57.639 --> 09:58.932
If you want to.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.692
You fucking asshole!

10:10.027 --> 10:11.570
Hey! What are you doing here?

10:13.488 --> 10:15.824
-Let them go!
-Get away!

10:15.908 --> 10:17.701
Leave them alone. I don't care!

10:17.784 --> 10:19.995
Where did you come from, asshole? Go home!

10:22.039 --> 10:24.666
Hey, back off, I'm warning you. Back off.

10:24.750 --> 10:25.834
Let them go!

10:25.918 --> 10:28.295
Are you deaf, asshole? Get back!

10:29.796 --> 10:31.632
Fuck this kid!

11:04.039 --> 11:06.917
I'm going to rip your ears off, asshole!

11:20.347 --> 11:22.140
We need to go!

11:45.539 --> 11:46.540
Is he mad?

11:48.959 --> 11:52.087
As in angry? Or…

11:53.255 --> 11:54.298
Angry.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.967
No, he's not angry. Not at you.

12:03.974 --> 12:10.272
But he's right. Even if we could get away,
there's a warrant on your dad.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.317
Charlie killed a cartel guy.
There's nowhere we can go.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.237
Bullshit. There's somewhere.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.865
-There's always somewhere.
-Oh, yeah?

12:19.948 --> 12:22.826
Where we don't end up dead, or going
to jail for the rest of our lives?

12:22.910 --> 12:25.495
Outstanding.
So, why don't you tell me all about it?

12:25.579 --> 12:27.331
Tell me what we do and where we go?

12:30.125 --> 12:31.126
Well?

12:31.960 --> 12:38.634
This is just him getting his way. Again.
You've always done what he wants, Mom.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.303
Every single time. And--

12:41.386 --> 12:45.557
And we have to pay the price for it.
Me and Charlie.

12:46.808 --> 12:51.104
I mean, look at you sitting there.
Thinking you've got all the answers.

12:52.523 --> 12:53.690
You sound just like him.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.111
Yeah.

13:01.532 --> 13:02.866
Well, fuck you.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.743
Fuck you too.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.704
Did I say you could leave?

13:07.788 --> 13:11.667
-Stop me. I'm 16.
-And I'm your mother. Now sit down.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.419
Look.

13:16.129 --> 13:20.384
I'm really, really tired.
I'm sorry. I'm just-- I'm tired, okay?

13:20.467 --> 13:24.888
So just get the fuck off your high horse
for one minute and sit down, please.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.939
Okay. I'm listening.

13:37.568 --> 13:38.569
So?

13:38.652 --> 13:41.071
There's a way. It's--

13:42.489 --> 13:45.075
It's a roll of the dice,
but there could be a way out.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.869
-Okay.
-But you have to understand,

13:46.952 --> 13:49.288
if we do it, it's something
we can never come back from.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.123
And you have to be okay with that.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.917
I don't care, Mom. What is it?

13:54.543 --> 13:56.795
Oh, my God.
It's gonna break his heart. It's just--

13:57.880 --> 13:59.381
Why does that even matter to you?

14:02.926 --> 14:05.220
Do you really think he loves you, Mom?

14:05.304 --> 14:11.810
'Cause this isn't love,
it's coercive control.

14:13.770 --> 14:18.192
Is that what I look like to you? A victim?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.081
I need to give your dad an excuse
to stay in that goddamn workshop

14:33.165 --> 14:34.875
for a couple of hours
and keep him out of the way.

14:34.958 --> 14:38.295
And you need to keep the boat kid
off the boat. The Magdalena.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.797
-You mean Adolfo?
-Whatever.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.008
You just gotta keep him away
from the boat. Can you do it?

14:43.091 --> 14:46.470
Yeah. I mean, yeah, I can definitely try.
What's the plan?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.679
No, that's not good enough.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.891
I need to be able to get on that boat
without anyone seeing me.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.977
So you do it, or you don't.
No half measures.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.316
-Dina?
-Yeah. Okay.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.442
Okay.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.512
A lot more organized than it looks.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.306
I guess it would have to be.

15:32.808 --> 15:36.228
What about you, Allie?
Are you under control?

15:38.939 --> 15:40.816
How are the kids doing?

15:43.277 --> 15:44.528
They're fine.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.657
Charlie is struggling but he's resilient.
I'm gonna let him work through it.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.159
Dina is a bit homesick.

15:52.494 --> 15:56.415
Margot didn't exactly enjoy
your guy sticking a gun to her head.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.126
He was never going to hurt her.

16:00.377 --> 16:05.382
Well, then she's the same.
She's Margot, she's fucking nuts.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.513
Says the guy who just sank his own boat.

16:13.432 --> 16:18.020
My request was clear.
I thought we had an understanding.

16:18.604 --> 16:22.065
I did you a favor.
I had to make an executive decision.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.109
That's not how we do things.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.197
That boat was always
gonna be a problem for you.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.158
Big 42-foot billboard out there saying,

16:31.241 --> 16:33.243
"Come to Isela's place,
the Foxes are here."

16:35.579 --> 16:39.082
That boat was a valuable resource.

16:40.959 --> 16:41.960
And you know that.

16:42.544 --> 16:46.590
And we don't go around making rash,
executive decisions.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.927
I took a very personal risk
bringing you here, Allie.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.513
Please, don't make me regret that choice.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.139
You won't.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.642
Good, because as you can see,

16:56.725 --> 16:59.520
it took a long time for this place
to find its footing.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.230
And I need you to respect that.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.986
Good. Having said that,
I am very glad you're here.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.489
I wish we came years ago.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.992
Well, don't blame me.
I've been inviting you for years.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.499
And it would've been
a much simpler thing having you around.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.127
Yeah.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.423
Just one more thing.

17:29.591 --> 17:30.717
Level with me.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.847
Margot. Is she gonna be a problem?

17:36.473 --> 17:37.474
No.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.813
'Kay.
Believe it or not, I'm going to church.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.284
Amen.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.184
-What happened?
-Nothing.

18:23.437 --> 18:24.479
Charlie?

18:25.814 --> 18:28.775
Hey, look at me. It's okay.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.113
Okay. How bad is it?

18:42.789 --> 18:44.958
So, are you going to Isela's?

18:45.459 --> 18:48.670
Yep. I gotta go see a girl
about a boat. You?

18:49.338 --> 18:52.090
I'll just hang out on the boat
till you need me.

18:53.050 --> 18:56.720
She's trouble, Dolfo. They all are.
The whole family.

18:57.554 --> 19:01.350
I need you to pilot the trawler back solo,
so no heavy drinking. You understand?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.268
Yes, sir.

19:03.352 --> 19:06.230
Till then, you do what you want.

19:19.368 --> 19:20.744
Where's the trawler?

19:24.540 --> 19:25.958
Take care of the boat kid, right?

19:35.717 --> 19:37.135
They're not coming looking for you.

19:37.636 --> 19:40.681
As long as they don't know
where you came from, you're good.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.184
And these men, you're sure
they didn't follow you home?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.688
-I don't think so.
-"Think" or you know?

19:47.771 --> 19:50.607
Yeah but there was this camera.

19:52.276 --> 19:53.318
What kind of camera?

19:54.403 --> 19:56.947
I don't know. It was, like,
in a box nailed to a tree.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.783
Like a trap camera?

20:00.701 --> 20:01.869
I guess.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.954
Okay. You think you can find it again?

20:05.664 --> 20:06.665
Yeah.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.584
Good.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.507
What are you two cooking up?

20:16.466 --> 20:18.051
Just hanging out. Why?

20:22.389 --> 20:25.893
It was eating my books,
and it has a few friends.

20:25.976 --> 20:28.228
So I just wondered
if you could make another mousetrap.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.522
Yeah, sure thing. Can I get to it later?

20:30.606 --> 20:33.442
Right now, Charlie wants
to show me these soldier ants.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.985
-Army.
-Army ants.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.320
In the jungle?

20:36.987 --> 20:37.988
Yeah, in the jungle.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.241
Well, be back before dark please.

20:43.035 --> 20:44.411
Can I leave this here?

20:47.581 --> 20:49.082
Sure, yeah. We'll cook it for lunch.

21:24.660 --> 21:25.953
Where's the fucking boat?

21:31.959 --> 21:32.793
Sit down.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.057
Hey.

21:47.766 --> 21:48.600
Hey!

21:50.644 --> 21:53.772
You still wanna do something?

21:53.856 --> 21:54.773
Yeah, sure.

22:00.529 --> 22:01.905
I mean…

22:01.989 --> 22:03.448
We don't have to.

22:03.532 --> 22:06.034
No it's fine, really.

22:09.079 --> 22:10.831
What do you want to do?

22:13.584 --> 22:16.753
Well, Ridley wants me to clean the boat.

22:16.837 --> 22:20.966
So I was thinking maybe you could help me?

22:23.427 --> 22:25.262
Yeah, totally.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.556
I mean, we could…

22:30.350 --> 22:31.810
It's a joke.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.274
I'm glad you got your boots on.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.027
-I want to show you something.
-Oh, no.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.322
All right. Shall we?

22:43.906 --> 22:45.240
We shall.

22:51.747 --> 22:54.333
This isn't about the trawler.
I could give a damn about the trawler.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.459
This is about you.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.836
I know you care about this place, Ridley.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.756
You've lost your mind
when it comes to this guy.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.217
Do you know about the antics
his boy pulled back in town?

23:03.300 --> 23:07.137
-He shot a guy in the face. Cartel guy.
-Of course.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.474
-And you're cool with that?
-I'm not alarmed by it.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.227
It's brought
all manner of asshats sniffing around.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.395
-Such as?
-Cops, journalists.

23:15.479 --> 23:18.941
Plus, some gringo guy
with friends in high places.

23:19.024 --> 23:21.276
He's been flashing guns and money
like there's no tomorrow.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.237
And did you take it?

23:24.696 --> 23:27.533
His money?
But someone's gonna, and what then?

23:32.079 --> 23:34.456
As long as nobody
who knows anything says anything,

23:34.998 --> 23:36.625
they'll get tired of looking.

23:38.252 --> 23:43.006
This guy, Allie, shouldn't be here.
He's putting all these people at risk.

23:43.090 --> 23:45.843
They trust you, Isela. To look after them.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.220
So why are you doing this shit for him?

23:51.890 --> 23:52.933
Because we need him.

24:21.628 --> 24:24.882
Directory assistance, Washington, D.C.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.644
Almost there.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.504
Pretty cool, right?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.714
It's…

25:07.382 --> 25:09.259
I don't know the word.

25:09.343 --> 25:12.971
You could say something
like " qué chido " maybe.

25:13.055 --> 25:15.557
Or " padre."

25:17.559 --> 25:19.144
" Padre " means cool?

25:19.728 --> 25:20.729
Sí.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.022
No mi padre.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.698
If you don't mind. Thank you.

25:35.869 --> 25:37.829
What are you doing?

25:37.913 --> 25:39.706
Taking you to the movies.

25:43.544 --> 25:45.003
What are we watching?

25:45.087 --> 25:46.964
Transformers: Age of Extinction.

25:48.549 --> 25:49.550
Okay.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.886
No, just kidding.

25:52.970 --> 25:54.972
I like classic movies a lot.

25:56.223 --> 25:57.349
It's incredible. You'll love it.

25:59.268 --> 26:00.102
Please.

26:22.040 --> 26:22.958
Ready?

26:57.659 --> 26:58.744
Margot who?

27:00.078 --> 27:01.079
Fox.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.709
You pulling my leg
a little bit there, Margot?

27:06.335 --> 27:08.337
'Cause the other one's
got a little bell on it.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.048
You know what?
I don't have time to piss around here.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.800
-I'm on a clock.
-Yeah, you and me both.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.970
You got 30 seconds
till I step into a meeting.

27:17.054 --> 27:17.888
Okay, fine.

27:17.971 --> 27:20.933
You're the prick who spent ten years
with a hard-on for Allie.

27:21.016 --> 27:23.769
You sent a bunch of agents down to Mexico
to bring us back.

27:23.852 --> 27:27.272
They had no jurisdiction.
They ended up dead for it.

27:27.356 --> 27:30.317
All because you wanted to get payback
on some handyman

27:30.400 --> 27:33.403
who made you look stupid back in the day.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.906
Well, it's nice to meet you, Margot.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.576
Seems like you and the old man
have quite a bit in common.

27:39.660 --> 27:41.912
Honestly, not as much as you'd think.

27:44.164 --> 27:46.416
So, why are we having
this conversation, huh?

27:47.084 --> 27:50.420
Ideal world,
what do you hope to get from it?

27:54.716 --> 27:57.219
I'm gonna need full immunity
for my children.

27:57.970 --> 28:00.973
Full. Official. On paper.

28:01.557 --> 28:04.518
And I'm gonna need full immunity
for myself to be with my children.

28:04.601 --> 28:08.981
Now, Margot, from what I understand,
you blew a nice young woman to hamburger

28:09.064 --> 28:13.318
for no apparent reason
the FBI could ever ascertain.

28:13.402 --> 28:16.071
So, why would I wanna help you?

28:16.947 --> 28:18.490
Because if you do…

28:21.702 --> 28:23.245
I'll give you Allie Fox.

28:30.460 --> 28:34.882
You get back what you lost.
Your job. Your reputation.

28:34.965 --> 28:38.135
I get to keep my children safe,
and everyone's happy.

28:39.136 --> 28:40.220
Everyone but Allie.

28:40.804 --> 28:43.640
I want my life back.
Isn't that what you want?

28:45.684 --> 28:49.605
Listen, Margot, I'm gonna do something
that's not really in my nature.

28:49.688 --> 28:50.689
I'm gonna level with you.

28:51.565 --> 28:54.526
Yeah. I wanted Allie.

28:54.610 --> 28:58.947
I played fast and loose. I lost people.

28:59.031 --> 29:00.407
I'm out.

29:00.490 --> 29:01.825
So this is your way back.

29:02.951 --> 29:05.287
I can't tell you how much I wish it were.

29:06.997 --> 29:10.417
But the truth is, Allie's not enough.
Not to buy my way back in,

29:10.501 --> 29:11.835
and not yours either.

29:13.754 --> 29:15.964
He doesn't know
you're making this call, does he?

29:21.929 --> 29:23.055
Listen, Margot.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.558
For what little it might be worth…

29:28.560 --> 29:31.188
I got a pretty good idea what it took
for you to make this call.

29:31.271 --> 29:33.106
How desperate you must be.

29:33.190 --> 29:34.525
It's like the man says, huh?

29:34.608 --> 29:40.364
"Love is whatever you can still betray.
Betrayal only happens if you love."

29:41.240 --> 29:44.701
-You're my only way home.
- Margot, it's out of my hands.

29:44.785 --> 29:50.541
You're wherever the hell you are,
and I'm where I am.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.627
That's just the way it's gotta be.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.296
Fuck you.

31:09.411 --> 31:10.412
Okay.

31:11.205 --> 31:15.459
Okay, so, like, is it on?
Do you think someone has my picture?

31:17.002 --> 31:19.546
-Yeah, could be. Sure.
-Fuck!

31:20.047 --> 31:22.007
-Fuck!
-Hey!

31:22.090 --> 31:25.260
It's okay. It's fine.

31:25.344 --> 31:28.263
People are looking for us.
They're looking for me 'cause I--

31:28.347 --> 31:30.974
All right. The guys at the other end,
maybe they've seen your picture.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.059
End of the day, so what?

31:32.142 --> 31:34.228
That was a long way away.

31:34.311 --> 31:35.979
I don't want you to worry about that.

31:36.730 --> 31:40.692
Now, worst thing these guys are gonna see
is some muddy-ass kid,

31:40.776 --> 31:43.862
you know, looks like an orc or something.
Some kind of a jungle monster.

31:45.322 --> 31:47.157
Now, the chances of them connecting
to that

31:47.241 --> 31:51.328
to something else that happened
a long, long way away?

31:51.411 --> 31:52.579
That's not gonna happen.

31:53.914 --> 31:54.957
We're safe.

31:55.666 --> 31:56.667
Okay.

31:57.918 --> 32:00.420
But no one needs to know about this, okay?

32:01.630 --> 32:05.467
Not Isela, not your mom.
Nobody but you and me.

33:01.773 --> 33:05.027
They got
a little Los Saicos vibe going on there.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.487
Course, they put a modern spin on it.

33:08.071 --> 33:10.949
Still, I guess
these things have to move on.

33:13.368 --> 33:14.494
Gentlemen.

33:17.331 --> 33:20.292
So, you're the guy
who's been asking for a sit-down?

33:20.375 --> 33:22.044
Yes, sir, Mr. Bautista. I am.

33:22.669 --> 33:27.424
-And what is it you're looking for, man?
-A job. If you're hiring.

33:33.013 --> 33:35.557
Okay, sit. Please, and join us.

33:37.976 --> 33:42.523
Look, I know Lucrecia Salazar, of course.

33:43.232 --> 33:45.192
Why are you no longer working for her?

33:46.902 --> 33:48.320
I'll take a soda, please.

33:50.864 --> 33:54.660
Well, sir, if you're
asking me to bad-mouth Lucrecia Salazar,

33:54.743 --> 33:56.995
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

33:57.079 --> 33:59.248
Truth is, I don't think
Lucrecia wants to see me

33:59.331 --> 34:02.543
on the wrong side of the grass
any more than I wanna be there.

34:03.168 --> 34:06.547
She just feels obliged is all.
You know, rules of the game and so forth.

34:06.630 --> 34:09.299
However, were you to intercede,

34:09.382 --> 34:12.094
she would be absolved of that burden.

34:12.177 --> 34:14.638
So you're not asking for a job, amigo.

34:16.348 --> 34:18.058
You are asking for protection.

34:18.641 --> 34:22.980
I'm just a guy down on his luck
looking for a new opportunity.

34:33.532 --> 34:37.578
-All right. Let's get this done.
-Okay.

35:10.569 --> 35:11.737
Bang.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.906
Say something, bro! Stop messing around!

35:13.989 --> 35:16.325
Now, if you want me
to shoot him, I'll shoot him.

35:16.408 --> 35:19.494
Seems to me like a waste
of a nice enough fella.

35:19.995 --> 35:22.039
Still got a lot of use left in him.

35:22.664 --> 35:25.250
But, you are the boss.

35:28.086 --> 35:30.797
Okay, take it easy, man.

35:42.684 --> 35:44.186
You can put the gun down.

35:47.773 --> 35:49.191
You're Mr. Bautista?

35:52.819 --> 35:56.156
I have to say, that's a pretty nifty
first line of defense you got there.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.284
I do what I can.

36:03.622 --> 36:04.665
You're hired.

36:05.707 --> 36:07.000
Friend.

36:29.314 --> 36:30.315
Go home.

37:10.731 --> 37:11.732
Hey, Mom.

37:16.486 --> 37:17.905
Where's your dad?

37:17.988 --> 37:23.744
He's just at the workshop.
Working on a new rattrap or whatever.

37:24.494 --> 37:26.580
Okay. Well, it's late.

37:26.663 --> 37:28.582
You should go to bed.
Shower in the morning.

37:28.665 --> 37:31.084
Okay. Good night.

37:32.753 --> 37:34.087
Good night, honey.

37:37.591 --> 37:38.967
Love you.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.138
I love you too.

37:43.222 --> 37:44.681
Are you okay?

37:45.807 --> 37:47.851
Sure. Of course.

38:09.998 --> 38:11.291
You know, actually,

38:12.167 --> 38:14.044
I think it's gonna be
a really good rattrap.

38:14.127 --> 38:15.963
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

38:16.463 --> 38:19.216
Dad showed me the plan and everything.
I think it's really cool.

38:23.095 --> 38:24.221
It will be okay.

38:39.361 --> 38:40.779
I bet he did.

38:42.614 --> 38:46.743
Go to sleep. Long day.

38:56.753 --> 38:57.838
Night, Mom.
