00:00.330 --> 00:05.880
- Hello ?
- The Rambaldi device in exchange for Sydney Bristow. Do we have a deal ?

00:06.350 --> 00:06.980
Yes.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.260
Keep this phone with you at all times.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.090
You will be notified as to time and place.

00:12.850 --> 00:14.960
Do you have confirmation of the Covenant's demands ?

00:15.480 --> 00:18.180
My sources have confirmed they are holding Sydney Bristow.

00:19.140 --> 00:22.500
They're asking for the Rambaldi device 
in exchange for her release.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.180
During the exchange,

00:24.740 --> 00:27.080
I want Sydney Bristow taken out.

00:27.310 --> 00:28.500
Why come to me ?

00:28.810 --> 00:33.020
Because I want assurance 
that Sydney Bristow is eliminated.

00:33.130 --> 00:36.750
Your research in memory retrieval 
sounds quite promising.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.710
Oh, yeah, well that's, that's really a trip.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.480
Oh my God !

01:09.120 --> 01:10.890
Will ? What do you...

01:17.390 --> 01:18.970
What does this mean ?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.220
What happened ?

01:25.320 --> 01:25.920
We're pulling you out.

01:26.030 --> 01:28.720
- I gave you a shot of 10cc's of adrenaline.
- Why ?

01:28.870 --> 01:30.270
- To wake you up.
- No ! I was...

01:30.380 --> 01:31.410
Sydney, we are not going to let this thing kill you.

01:31.510 --> 01:33.460
Dad, I have to go back, there's... 
there's something...

01:33.560 --> 01:35.120
You were going to flatline again. 
You are not going back.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.580
I was in my old apartment, I was there with Will.

01:37.650 --> 01:40.690
- Did Will say anything ?
- No, nothing. But there was something.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.870
The cocktail mixture really needs to be adjusted, you know, and...

01:43.380 --> 01:45.030
- Please don't do that.
- We're out of here !

01:45.700 --> 01:49.100
- You're not going to put her through this again.
- But I'm sure that I can give you something...

01:49.120 --> 01:50.940
Will knew something. Dad !

01:51.230 --> 01:53.300
Alright, Sydney. I'll contact the witness protection division.

01:55.970 --> 01:57.120
Wait, no ! Dad !

01:58.600 --> 02:01.850
Pulling Will out of witness protection 
could be dangerous to him.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.260
I'm not suggesting we pull him out. 
I'm suggesting we simply contact him.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.960
He knew Allison. He was there the night 
you were abducted.

02:08.050 --> 02:09.530
You'd know if he knew anything.

02:10.039 --> 02:13.530
Will must have been debriefed by the CIA 
before he went into the program.

02:13.630 --> 02:14.810
Not by you.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.720
You'll go see him, recount your dreams.

02:16.820 --> 02:19.160
See if we can get another clue 
to your missing time.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.520
Contacting Will puts him in no danger.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.800
Maybe not. I just don't want to pull him back 
into this.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.840
Sydney, you have to do this.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.800
You looked like you were struggling at the end.

02:29.890 --> 02:30.980
What was happening ?

02:31.270 --> 02:32.540
When I was under,

02:33.440 --> 02:35.430
I fought myself.

02:38.690 --> 02:39.900
I killed myself

02:46.610 --> 02:50.650
and I heard myself say that it was the Covenant that had me

02:51.140 --> 02:54.150
and that it wasn't an accident 
that I don't remember.

02:54.840 --> 02:59.210
Dr. Brezzel commented that based on the data he compiled. He believed

02:59.580 --> 03:02.780
the memory of your missing time 
has been removed.

03:02.780 --> 03:03.480
What ?

03:03.560 --> 03:05.920
And that however the memories were extracted,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.400
the precision with which it was done indicates

03:08.820 --> 03:11.270
you may have been a willing participant.

03:12.330 --> 03:13.850
I don't understand.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.030
Yeah, neither did he.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.380
Lindsey still biting ?

03:40.480 --> 03:42.570
Lindsey clearly has his suspicions.

03:42.670 --> 03:46.280
But his agreement to go along with the trade seems to confirm that he's accepted the idea

03:46.390 --> 03:48.600
that Sydney is being held by the Covenant.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.110
Where is Sydney ?

03:51.650 --> 03:52.970
Pursuing another lead.

03:53.610 --> 03:57.100
A result of meeting the doctor. 
Then, he was helpful ?

03:57.540 --> 04:00.480
Despite the fact that he almost killed her, yeah, the doctor was great.

04:01.740 --> 04:06.530
The NSC is expecting one more call from 
the Covenant to set up the time and place 
for the exchange.

04:06.690 --> 04:08.330
Sydney for the Rambaldi device.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.950
You want me to make the call, 
representing the Covenant.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.730
Yes.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.980
We're heading back to the CIA to disabuse Lindsey of any suspicion that we've been 
in contact with Sydney.

04:17.070 --> 04:21.269
the meantime, I've instructed Sydney 
to contact you when she's ready to return.

04:26.470 --> 04:30.350
I just want to say for the record, concerning 
this exchange,

04:30.440 --> 04:32.120
Sydney's life is in your hands.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.050
If you betray her, I swear to you,

04:34.140 --> 04:36.220
no matter what it costs me, I will kill you.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.730
No need to worry, Agent Vaughn,

04:40.140 --> 04:41.180
I love her, too.

04:53.430 --> 04:54.230
Jonah ! Hey !

04:54.360 --> 04:57.590
Come on, quit being management, will you ? 
Let's go get a bite to eat.

04:57.820 --> 04:59.520
You know what, I've got to finish this schedule 
by tomorrow.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.170
- Where you guys going ? Chancetown's ?
- Yeah.

05:01.220 --> 05:04.370
I mean, I'll save a seat for you, but you know 
how the women get around me, right ?

05:04.490 --> 05:05.880
Yeah, I do, yeah.

05:06.150 --> 05:07.430
There's probably no room for me.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.780
See you later !

05:22.430 --> 05:23.140
Hi.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.690
I know...

05:45.150 --> 05:47.500
- Listen...
- You're dead.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.660
I wanna tell you everything.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.200
Is there somewhere we can talk ?

05:59.950 --> 06:01.030
Yeah.

06:02.350 --> 06:03.310
Sure.

06:04.650 --> 06:06.400
Let me just go get my stuff.

06:13.110 --> 06:15.810
- Will, what the hell are you doing ?
- Sydney Bristow died in a fire two years ago.

06:15.900 --> 06:16.660
Will, I swear to God I'm me !

06:16.760 --> 06:17.850
I know about project Helix.

06:17.970 --> 06:19.080
I know what you are !

06:19.180 --> 06:19.990
I'm not a double.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.330
- How the hell did you find me ?
- My father knows your case officer.

06:21.330 --> 06:22.700
- What's his name ?
- I don't know.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.570
- What's my case officer's name ?
- Will, I don't know. I didn't talk to him.

06:24.660 --> 06:25.460
Sit down on your knees !

06:25.530 --> 06:26.690
Get down !

06:28.010 --> 06:29.860
I'm gonna call Langley. 
I'm gonna tell 'em you're here.

06:29.950 --> 06:30.700
Will, you can't do that.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.970
I'm a fugitive. That's part of what I'm telling you. 
If you make that call, you'll burn me.

06:34.080 --> 06:34.990
Oh, that's convenient !

06:35.100 --> 06:37.220
Wait, okay ! Listen, listen !

06:37.550 --> 06:39.380
Remember, when we thought you were a double,

06:39.460 --> 06:41.810
you told me to ask you something 
only Will would know.

06:41.970 --> 06:44.940
Ask me something, ask me something obscure.

06:47.230 --> 06:49.230
When I had my job interview for the newspaper,

06:49.330 --> 06:51.500
something happened to me that day. 
I told you about it.

06:51.580 --> 06:52.410
What was it ?

06:52.500 --> 06:55.160
Someone bumped into you on the elevator. 
They spilled coffee on your new white shirt.

06:55.260 --> 06:59.550
You were freaked but Litvack said 
it made you look like a working reporter. 
She gave you the job.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.190
You know that if I wanted to hurt you, I could.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.440
You're my best friend. You're my oldest friend.

07:19.130 --> 07:20.120
I love you.

07:22.130 --> 07:23.560
Why are you aiming a gun at me ?

07:28.290 --> 07:29.340
Oh my God !

08:05.120 --> 08:06.860
I found a marksman.

08:07.910 --> 08:08.980
How much ?

08:11.360 --> 08:17.290
500 000 wired to this account.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.930
Done.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.520
There's no margin for error here.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.920
If Sydney Bristow somehow survives this, 
I will turn over

08:28.030 --> 08:31.640
the dossier of your extra-curricular activities 
to the Justice Department.

09:24.650 --> 09:26.510
- Doctor Brezzel ?
- Yes ?

09:34.400 --> 09:36.440
Considering everything, I suppose I was lucky.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.270
I woke up in the bathtub.

09:38.470 --> 09:39.630
The place was on fire.

09:40.370 --> 09:41.590
I crawled out.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.790
A few days later, I woke up in the hospital.

09:44.670 --> 09:47.510
The fact that I actually wasn't dating Francie, 
that it was her double,

09:47.620 --> 09:51.770
I thought that was like the number one 
most insane story of all time.

09:52.990 --> 09:56.200
But yours actually tops it.

09:57.910 --> 09:59.770
She survived.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.240
Allison Doren, the woman 
you thought was Francie.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.910
She's working with a group called the Covenant.

10:09.440 --> 10:14.990
We think they're the ones responsible 
for kidnapping me, for setting the fires.

10:19.630 --> 10:23.710
You know, I've always thought of myself 
as a pacifist.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.560
The idea of taking someone's life is just...

10:27.710 --> 10:28.860
inconceivable.

10:30.490 --> 10:33.220
But if I have a chance to kill Allison...

10:36.240 --> 10:38.560
I never would have come here if I didn't have to.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.070
Are you kidding me ?

10:40.780 --> 10:44.650
You're like most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.730
I went to see a doctor.

10:49.870 --> 10:53.630
He had this sort of dream therapy he thought might help me remember what happened to me.

10:54.210 --> 10:56.080
I was hoping you could help me make sense of it.

10:56.190 --> 10:57.740
We were sitting in my old apartment.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.780
There's a box of cereal on the counter.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.470
The box had a name written on it, something 
I kept seeing in the dream :

11:03.560 --> 11:04.750
Saint Aidan.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.870
St. Aidan was a contact of mine when I was 
an analyst at the Agency.

11:09.010 --> 11:11.190
Yeah, St. Aidan was his codename.

11:11.290 --> 11:12.510
What was his real name ?

11:12.610 --> 11:13.710
I never knew it.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.760
An arms dealer put me in touch with him.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.270
Do you remember how to contact him ?

11:17.450 --> 11:18.760
Yeah, he would only meet with me.

11:18.870 --> 11:20.090
You know I can go in there again, go in alone...

11:20.180 --> 11:21.820
- No.
- Maybe I am...

11:21.930 --> 11:24.390
~It assumes it's gonna be all of them. 
He will only meet me in person.~

11:24.480 --> 11:25.660
- I didn't come here to pull you back into this.
- I have spent

11:25.770 --> 11:30.190
the last two years of my life pretending to be somebody that I'm not.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.310
- It's not your fault. I didn't see...
- You weren't sleeping with her.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.500
When you made contact with St. Aidan, 
what was the protocol ?

11:41.370 --> 11:44.550
I'd dial a number, an answering machine 
in Bucharest.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.300
When it picked up, I'd dial a confirmation code.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.400
I'd hang up and wait for him to call for me back.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.300
Yes ?

11:58.480 --> 11:59.910
If you can, we need to meet.

12:00.930 --> 12:04.200
Tuesday night, eleven o'clock. Same location.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.110
Listen to me very carefully, doctor.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.750
I need to know what Sydney Bristow told you.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.440
Sydney...

12:23.470 --> 12:25.120
The brunette...

12:29.570 --> 12:31.600
Yes, she was the brunette.

12:31.790 --> 12:34.030
You had helped her recover her memories.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.660
Tell me what she found.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.580
The morphine is really good...

12:40.750 --> 12:45.444
Like the old days when I... 
Oh but don't, don't turn it off...

12:47.510 --> 12:49.140
Answer the question.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.420
Answer, and then you get more.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.950
She said she fought

12:55.040 --> 12:56.190
herself

12:56.780 --> 13:03.600
and then she saw her friend, Will.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.390
- She saw Will in her dream ?
- Yes.

13:06.650 --> 13:08.500
The father...

13:09.140 --> 13:13.730
he said he would call the... call a witness...

13:13.840 --> 13:19.900
No, no, he'd call the witness protection division.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.340
Meaning Tippin's still alive ?

13:24.540 --> 13:29.120
Meaning I really need some more morphine.

13:29.260 --> 13:32.100
I've earned it, don't you think ?

13:32.530 --> 13:34.940
Yes, it's...

13:35.600 --> 13:38.070
Not so much because I could...

13:38.880 --> 13:39.840
I could...

13:57.000 --> 14:00.500
As you know, a number of the video cameras 
at the facility were shot out.

14:00.620 --> 14:05.570
Those that remained functional provided us 
with only marginal images of the men 
who took Sydney.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.180
We ran the video through our database 
and came up with eight possible matches.

14:09.270 --> 14:13.870
Now, two weeks ago one of those suspects rented an a-star helicopter from a dealer 
in Houston...

14:14.000 --> 14:16.490
...where he also recently purchased a warehouse downtown.

14:16.610 --> 14:17.480
We went there but 

14:17.630 --> 14:19.700
the building was only being used for storage...

14:19.810 --> 14:22.190
boxes of fishing equipment. It was a dead end.

14:22.310 --> 14:23.670
Fishing equipment ?

14:25.060 --> 14:26.130
Nice detail.

14:28.990 --> 14:31.290
The bullets that the Covenant used 
are untraceable.

14:31.850 --> 14:35.830
The manufacturer hasn't actually made 
these shells for 15 years.

14:37.330 --> 14:39.250
Oh, I reread your file.

14:39.990 --> 14:43.680
I forgot you were captured 
by East German intelligence agents...

14:43.770 --> 14:45.250
1982.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.610
Yeah, it wasn't your fault of course.

14:47.990 --> 14:50.860
They'd gotten a tip that CIA was on their tail.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.660
But you were unprepared.

14:52.820 --> 14:54.880
No backup, no resources.

14:55.470 --> 14:59.250
Still, you convinced them your name was 
Aiken Oostburg,

14:59.380 --> 15:01.000
a history professor from Sweden.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.460
They held you for two weeks, never identified you as American. That's...

15:05.920 --> 15:07.410
That's impressive.

15:09.330 --> 15:13.690
We are talking about the fate of my daughter.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.140
Where do you think she is ?

15:22.560 --> 15:24.840
Don't... do this.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.420
Where do you think she...

15:27.940 --> 15:28.890
Jack !

15:29.420 --> 15:31.600
- Let him go !
- Get them out of here !

15:31.620 --> 15:33.700
Take them into custody, now !

15:42.850 --> 15:45.050
If St. Aidan does show, what am I supposed 
to tell him ?

15:45.150 --> 15:47.120
That you've just been given code-six clearance.

15:47.230 --> 15:49.040
That you want information about the Covenant.

15:50.830 --> 15:53.190
- Last chance to bail out.
- What ? Are you kidding me ?

15:53.690 --> 15:55.090
I love this stuff.

16:06.110 --> 16:11.700
Based on my analysis of the calls the Covenant made about trading the Rambaldi device 
for Sydney, sir,

16:12.240 --> 16:14.740
well, the voiceprint analysis was unable 
to ID the voice

16:14.840 --> 16:19.040
because whoever it was, he was using an anti-speech signal parameterization device, so...

16:19.130 --> 16:20.100
You're telling me...

16:20.200 --> 16:21.190
you've got nothing ?

16:21.300 --> 16:22.450
Well, at the moment ?

16:22.920 --> 16:25.470
Yeah, I lack everything, sir.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.770
So we've got no way to verify that it was actually the Covenant making the demand for the trade ?

16:28.880 --> 16:31.100
Well, you could say that the fact 
that we can't confirm it was them

16:31.100 --> 16:32.000
is confirmation that it was them

16:32.010 --> 16:35.800
because it does look like particularly stealthy Covenant behavior, right ?

16:37.270 --> 16:39.230
Uh, sir ? Mr. Lindsey ! One more thing !

16:40.510 --> 16:45.310
I, um.... listen, I know I'm just a tech guy 
and I'm no one to you.

16:46.190 --> 16:49.480
Sydney Bristow means a lot to me.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.590
I just wanted your opinion. 
Is she gonna be alright ?

16:54.820 --> 16:58.660
I am doing everything in my power to bring this 
to a safe and swift conclusion.

16:59.460 --> 17:00.720
You have my word.

17:01.190 --> 17:01.900
Thank you.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.130
Is he always this late ?

17:12.450 --> 17:14.079
~We just met one time.~

17:16.859 --> 17:18.460
Mr. Tippin.

17:28.490 --> 17:29.950
What happened to your hand ?

17:32.060 --> 17:33.930
Another time perhaps.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.930
Oh my God ! That's Lazarey.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.380
It's good to see you again.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.490
I wasn't sure you'd come.

17:41.170 --> 17:46.610
I would not have come at all, except 
money's something I could use.

17:46.820 --> 17:48.660
We'll see what we can do about that.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.780
You should know I've been given 
code-six clearance.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.320
And I need to know about the Covenant.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.060
Why are you asking me about the Covenant ?

17:59.190 --> 18:02.860
- I thought that you would...
- How do you think I even know anything about them ?

18:02.990 --> 18:04.350
Well, obviously you know something.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.520
I cannot talk about Covenant.

18:07.970 --> 18:09.900
Wait a minute. Excuse, lives are at stake !

18:10.580 --> 18:12.440
Yes, they are !

18:13.140 --> 18:15.070
We have nothing further to discuss !

18:15.480 --> 18:18.690
- Tell him Julia Thorne sent you.
- Julia Thorne sent me.

18:26.390 --> 18:29.520
No, I don't believe you.

18:29.770 --> 18:32.150
- Yell out the name Lazarey !
- Lazarey !

18:32.270 --> 18:34.990
Tell him Julia told you his name, 
that she needs to see him,

18:34.960 --> 18:38.730
that she trusts him but she's in danger.

18:38.810 --> 18:39.740
It was Julia Thorne.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.270
She told me your name.

18:41.710 --> 18:43.130
She needs to see you.

18:43.260 --> 18:45.180
She trusts you but she's in danger.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.000
Did they find it ?

18:52.530 --> 18:54.260
I don't know what he's talking about.

18:54.390 --> 18:56.310
Have they been to Graz ?

18:56.640 --> 18:58.280
Need to know if...

19:02.230 --> 19:04.450
Will, get out of there ! They're after Lazarey.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.030
Sark !

19:30.280 --> 19:30.990
Will !

19:56.430 --> 19:58.120
I can't make sense of it.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.710
How he got to Lazarey, what he meant,

20:02.920 --> 20:04.320
what the Covenant wants.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.080
But they don't kill Lazarey, they tranq him.

20:08.170 --> 20:09.880
They abduct him, they wanted him.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.840
Lazarey asked if they got it.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.890
So, whatever's going on, there's a thing.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.180
Yeah, and there's someone else 
who's trying to find it.

20:19.310 --> 20:21.070
I mean, things really don't get any more vague than that, do they ?

20:21.210 --> 20:23.580
It's Sloane, it's obviously Sloane.

20:23.830 --> 20:27.320
Syd, you've been going over this 
since the beginning of time.

20:27.430 --> 20:30.270
You'll figure it out.

20:32.110 --> 20:33.580
What makes you say that ?

20:33.890 --> 20:36.260
Because you're you.

20:50.370 --> 20:52.670
Think that was the best move, punching Lindsey in the face ?

20:52.840 --> 20:56.620
Based on the comments he was making, it was obvious that you and I were going to end up here no matter what we did.

20:56.700 --> 21:00.840
Whether I hit him or not, he wasn't about 
to pass up the opportunity.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.950
We shouldn't have let Sydney go.

21:03.850 --> 21:05.620
- Vaughn.
- What ?

21:06.080 --> 21:08.720
Sydney can no longer be your primary concern.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.310
What the hell is that supposed to mean ?

21:10.420 --> 21:12.530
I didn't bring this up to start a petty fight.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.780
The fact is, you and I have something in common.

21:16.390 --> 21:19.680
We've both suffered through the death 
of the woman we loved,

21:19.700 --> 21:21.740
only to discover she was still alive.

21:22.370 --> 21:24.200
I know it's hard.

21:24.820 --> 21:26.910
but this isn't about you.

21:27.020 --> 21:30.150
And I will not allow my daughter 
to become your mistress.

21:32.300 --> 21:34.960
If that's where you think my concern 
for Sydney is headed,

21:35.050 --> 21:36.730
then you are even more cynical than I thought.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.900
If lightning strikes, Mr. Vaughn, 
and you and I get to walk free again,

21:39.990 --> 21:42.950
if you care about my daughter as you claim to,

21:43.840 --> 21:45.530
then push her away.

21:45.630 --> 21:46.760
Be cruel

21:46.870 --> 21:48.120
if you have to.

21:48.230 --> 21:49.750
Make her despise you

21:49.860 --> 21:53.170
because your kindness tortures her.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.690
I can see it, what it does to her.

21:59.390 --> 22:01.440
And I won't have it.

22:05.110 --> 22:07.980
You and Vaughn's wife work together.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.580
- Okay, how the hell did that happen ?
- Let's talk about you.

22:11.210 --> 22:14.430
A beautiful painter lives in your building 
and you haven't asked her out yet. Why ?

22:14.550 --> 22:18.840
Because Jonah's recovering 
from a post-traumatic dating syndrome

22:18.970 --> 22:22.750
after his last girlfriend dumped him 
by rammed a bayonet into his lungs.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.730
Let's go back to you.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.730
Okay, you and Vaughn's wife.

22:27.870 --> 22:29.680
Yeah, I hate her.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.760
I mean I don't, she's nice.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.560
- You hate her...
- Yeah...

22:39.430 --> 22:40.350
It's okay.

22:40.970 --> 22:42.630
But not 'cause of her.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.680
It's just...

22:47.070 --> 22:48.780
I still love him.

22:50.060 --> 22:54.550
God... That sucks.

22:56.680 --> 23:01.440
You know, Will, I'm considering everything, 
I think I'm pretty normal.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.290
I'm emotional.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.590
I try to be honest but I...

23:10.340 --> 23:13.090
I've never been a depressed person...

23:17.030 --> 23:18.130
until now.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.480
I get it.

23:20.730 --> 23:22.980
I mean, nothing has felt the same this year,

23:23.400 --> 23:24.870
and it's... it's not just Vaughn

23:25.570 --> 23:28.770
It's you, and Francie...

23:34.070 --> 23:35.310
I don't know...

23:35.420 --> 23:36.190
What ?

23:38.340 --> 23:40.030
I'm just alone.

23:46.910 --> 23:47.950
Hey, it's okay.

23:50.820 --> 23:51.720
It's okay.

23:56.580 --> 23:57.150
Syd...

24:11.360 --> 24:13.920
Your target : a government employee.

24:17.740 --> 24:18.970
When and where ?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.880
When I know, you'll know.

24:21.060 --> 24:26.310
And just when I was beginning to believe 
the glowing press about you being 
such a humanitarian...

24:27.950 --> 24:30.180
You're a smarter man than that.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.270
Who are you ?

24:59.830 --> 25:01.710
You abandoned me as a child.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.410
vague memory I have of you, you were physically abusive.

25:07.160 --> 25:11.100
Later in life you left me 800 million dollars. Should I go on ?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.320
Hello, daddy.

25:17.860 --> 25:19.970
You are not grateful ?

25:22.190 --> 25:24.810
Your inheritance was not enough ?

25:25.410 --> 25:29.850
I know the truth, and therefore I show no remorse seeing you like this.

25:31.770 --> 25:34.980
I was an apparatchik by profession

25:35.760 --> 25:39.150
but a Romanov by blood.

25:39.510 --> 25:41.360
So are you.

25:41.940 --> 25:45.900
In part, that's why I staged my death,

25:46.200 --> 25:50.040
to give you the inheritance that is rightfully yours.

25:50.150 --> 25:52.400
That's wonderful spin.

25:54.270 --> 25:58.330
You should know that the inheritance, 
that you hoped would buy my affection,

25:58.450 --> 26:01.300
now finances my employer,

26:01.760 --> 26:03.240
the Covenant.

26:03.410 --> 26:10.480
Julian... the Covenant...
They are... true evil.

26:11.410 --> 26:13.110
The man you were meeting with,

26:14.200 --> 26:16.690
I want to know exactly what you said to him.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.460
Every word.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.650
Pathetic !

26:32.870 --> 26:34.720
I'll give you a moment

26:37.210 --> 26:40.020
to remember exactly what you said.

26:47.670 --> 26:50.010
I'll ask you one more time :

26:51.160 --> 26:54.730
What exactly did you tell the man 
you were meeting with ?

26:54.980 --> 26:57.440
You wouldn't do something like this ?!

26:59.850 --> 27:02.490
Not to your own father !

27:15.900 --> 27:18.250
- Oh my God !
- I know, it's weird.

27:18.980 --> 27:21.220
I've been waiting to do that for like eight years.

27:21.430 --> 27:22.820
No, no !

27:22.930 --> 27:24.390
What you said before,

27:25.530 --> 27:26.930
about me being me.

27:27.390 --> 27:28.070
I don't remember.

27:28.190 --> 27:29.920
Lazarey asked if they have it,

27:30.240 --> 27:31.750
have they been to Graz.

27:31.860 --> 27:36.500
Whatever it was that was hidden, whatever 
he was talking about, I obviously had it.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.130
I must have had it in Graz.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.650
Whatever I did, if it was me,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.320
the choices I made were my choices.

27:44.410 --> 27:46.710
Oh, so if you had something to hide today,

27:46.840 --> 27:48.000
- where would you hide it...
- Exactly.

27:48.150 --> 27:50.880
Well, that depends on what it is, what context is.

27:50.970 --> 27:51.820
Assume for a second that it's

27:52.000 --> 27:56.060
information, it's data, video, something 
that can be stored.

27:56.170 --> 27:58.010
Well, if it's something small, it could be anywhere.

27:58.580 --> 27:59.720
Somewhere safe.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.470
Well, when Lazare spoke, it didn't sound like 
it was someplace protected.

28:04.750 --> 28:08.490
I know, that's why I figure a bank 
or a hotel safety deposit box.

28:08.590 --> 28:09.420
How come ?

28:09.730 --> 28:12.110
Because that's where I'd put it.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.960
Where would I hide something ?

28:17.820 --> 28:18.650
Wait a second.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.200
What ?

28:24.500 --> 28:27.333
Hotel Verluszeit (=waste of time)

28:36.410 --> 28:39.980
We're going to Graz. Hotel Verlustzeit.

29:04.330 --> 29:05.130
Hello !

29:05.580 --> 29:07.240
- Checking in ?
- Yeah, of course.

29:07.430 --> 29:09.440
I'm here, she's here, we made it !

29:12.340 --> 29:13.380
And you are ?

29:14.200 --> 29:16.130
We're the next big thing.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.600
This way please.

29:20.710 --> 29:22.110
This is one of our finest suites.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.930
Yeah, yeah. It's not bad, not bad.

29:24.910 --> 29:27.810
The bar is over there,

29:27.940 --> 29:32.190
and the gym is on the 6th floor, open 24-hours.

29:32.950 --> 29:35.600
Of course you have a balcony...

29:36.820 --> 29:37.930
a fantastic view.

29:39.410 --> 29:40.430
That should be it.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.190
Is there anything else I can get for you ?

29:45.300 --> 29:47.480
Yeah, thank you for asking.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.920
You know, you're a lovely little man, isn't he ?

29:50.160 --> 29:51.010
Thank you.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.120
Sweetheart, um, two bottles ?

29:53.270 --> 29:54.840
- Of what ?
- Champagne.

29:55.590 --> 29:58.150
Four ? Two ? Two bottles ?

29:58.250 --> 29:59.700
- One's good.
- One.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.550
We're going to get four bottles of champagne

30:03.680 --> 30:05.600
and I'm going to tip you like I ordered five.

30:05.700 --> 30:06.800
- You know what I mean ?
- Yes, sir.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.110
You do, don't you, you cheeky little bastard ?

30:09.210 --> 30:10.220
- Yes.
- Cheers.

30:14.890 --> 30:16.120
What ? What ?

30:16.360 --> 30:20.320
Come on, if we're going to do this, we've got to, you know, we've got to be legit about it.

30:22.870 --> 30:23.970
It was a little over the top.

30:24.640 --> 30:25.580
Over the top ?

30:25.790 --> 30:28.310
I'm wearing seat covering. 
There is no over the top.

30:28.770 --> 30:30.480
Plus, I like champagne.

30:30.730 --> 30:33.460
You keep forgetting I live in Wisconsin now.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.240
I am not squandering this.

30:37.510 --> 30:38.950
Call up the on-screen checkout.

30:39.950 --> 30:42.270
You have to admit my accent was pretty good.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.350
It was like early Stones.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.820
- I thought it was Australian.
- Shut up !

30:47.440 --> 30:50.150
I was like : 
"Yeah I'm here, she's here, we made it."

30:50.360 --> 30:51.320
I mean, that's good.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.440
Take a look at, right, that's enough, carry on.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.280
Let's get past these firewalls.

30:59.410 --> 31:00.940
See if I was ever here.

31:04.630 --> 31:05.860
Okay, we're in the system.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.110
Alright, what are we looking for ?

31:07.250 --> 31:08.870
Long-term storage contracts.

31:09.220 --> 31:12.670
The names of people who have things 
in safety deposit boxes, for example.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.710
Unbelievable.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.170
Box 23.

31:25.570 --> 31:27.830
See if they have the floor plan online.

31:27.940 --> 31:28.970
What if they don't ?

31:31.100 --> 31:31.870
Think positively !

31:33.000 --> 31:36.400
Here we go, sub-basement, just past 
the North-East corridor.

31:36.780 --> 31:37.780
What about security ?

31:37.960 --> 31:40.000
I'm almost done looping the surveillance cameras.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.030
Let's move !

32:15.330 --> 32:16.850
I assume you're not primping.

32:16.980 --> 32:17.720
Not exactly.

32:20.870 --> 32:21.730
Stand back.

32:39.190 --> 32:40.160
What is that ?

32:48.180 --> 32:49.240
Sark's got it !

32:52.440 --> 32:52.810
Go !

32:53.280 --> 32:54.540
Will, you can't, you're not trained !

32:54.620 --> 32:55.470
Go !

33:11.000 --> 33:12.620
I guess we have unfinished business.

33:49.390 --> 33:50.590
This is for Francie.

34:12.290 --> 34:12.929
Will.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.370
Will !

34:16.389 --> 34:17.790
We've gotta get out of here !

34:28.010 --> 34:29.340
Set the time and place with Lindsey.

34:29.350 --> 34:30.810
I'm ready to be traded back.

34:30.980 --> 34:34.620
Sydney, Lindsey's taken your father and Vaughn into custody.

34:35.190 --> 34:37.230
Dixon's in custody as well.

34:37.590 --> 34:42.469
But we need to proceed with this trade 
as planned so that Lindsey believes 
you were being held by the Covenant.

34:43.330 --> 34:46.159
The Rambaldi device is being delivered 
in San Pedro.

34:46.630 --> 34:47.860
I've hired a team to pick it up,

34:47.900 --> 34:49.790
they will appear to be working for the Covenant.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.489
As soon as they've left the area,

34:52.719 --> 34:54.699
you're to drive yourself to meet Lindsey.

34:54.810 --> 34:56.690
You are never ending up 
with the Rambaldi device.

34:57.020 --> 35:00.590
I want it put inside the van and taken directly 
to the parking lot at Hill street and 9th.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.300
I want the van to remain visible at all times. 
No one is to enter or exit the vehicle.

35:05.410 --> 35:07.550
Sydney, you have my word.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.630
That's a relief.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.310
- Weiss.
- Listen very carefully. I need a favor.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.140
Where are you ?

35:17.330 --> 35:19.000
Just listen to me and tell no one about this call.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.830
The Rambaldi device that's being traded 
to the Covenant,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.330
it's actually going to Sloane.

35:23.490 --> 35:26.710
He needs to be watched from the moment 
he gets the device.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.310
Grab the feed from a satellite 
that has a view of the trade.

35:29.430 --> 35:30.870
Track their van.

35:31.220 --> 35:35.080
Any suspicious stops, anyone gets on or off, 
have a team standing by to bring them in.

35:35.250 --> 35:38.510
Alright. I got it. 
Whatever the hell you're up to, good luck !

35:51.360 --> 35:52.100
Status ?

35:52.220 --> 35:55.660
Sir, the Covenant's representatives have taken possession of the Rambaldi Device.

36:00.050 --> 36:02.440
Syd, I'm tracking the van. The package is inside.

36:02.610 --> 36:05.090
Copy that. 
You'll follow the van to the rendezvous point.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.780
Anything unusual, you'll let me know.

36:07.110 --> 36:08.020
~Copy that.~

36:08.140 --> 36:09.950
I'm heading toward Lindsey. Wish me luck.

36:10.800 --> 36:14.020
Sir, we have a 20 on Agent Bristow. 
She's approaching the dock.

36:48.330 --> 36:49.450
Bristow's arrived.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.720
On behalf of the U.S. government, I want to say

36:54.920 --> 36:57.160
how relieved I am at your safe return.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.020
- Shots gun !
- Secure perimeter, now !

37:10.130 --> 37:11.990
- Shot from the west !
- Man down ! Man down !

37:27.050 --> 37:29.110
You murdered Robert Lindsay !

37:29.660 --> 37:31.750
I think you already know my response.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.270
Let me guess... 
"You don't know what I'm talking about".

37:34.590 --> 37:35.660
Not a word.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.550
I did everything as you asked.

37:57.690 --> 38:00.110
I followed your protocol precisely.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.710
This was your endgame the whole time.

38:06.850 --> 38:09.160
Now, you can go on blaming me if you like

38:09.300 --> 38:10.780
or you can accept the truth.

38:10.890 --> 38:11.600
Which is what ?

38:11.710 --> 38:14.190
The deceiver was Lindsey, not me.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.300
His team might have thought so

38:16.410 --> 38:19.190
but apparently Lindsey never gave us 
the Rambaldi Device.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.470
It was a setup.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.600
I don't know how you did this

38:31.740 --> 38:33.630
but you're not going to get away with it.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.260
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.360
It seems like everything is falling back into place.

39:09.010 --> 39:10.460
Thank you, by the way.

39:12.310 --> 39:14.190
- For everything.
- Yeah.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.630
I've gotta go.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.060
I'm meeting Lauren.

39:25.250 --> 39:28.260
Now, I'm not exactly sure what this means.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.000
What is that ?

39:30.060 --> 39:33.470
That was inside the box. It's human tissue,

39:33.960 --> 39:36.080
vital, still active.

39:36.380 --> 39:41.480
Oh ! And... there was a name 
etched inside the box :

39:44.510 --> 39:46.950
Milo Rambaldi.

39:54.150 --> 39:55.060
Will !

40:03.910 --> 40:05.320
I've been looking for you.

40:06.020 --> 40:07.020
You feeling alright ?

40:07.890 --> 40:08.650
Yeah.

40:13.950 --> 40:15.520
Seeing Allison again,

40:16.610 --> 40:17.520
killing her,

40:17.940 --> 40:21.410
I must have dreamed about it 
I don't know how many times.

40:22.610 --> 40:24.460
When you told me that she was still alive,

40:25.420 --> 40:27.770
I thought if I had the chance,

40:28.120 --> 40:31.020
that ending her life would be satisfying,

40:31.130 --> 40:32.820
you know, there'd be closure,

40:32.850 --> 40:34.350
it'd be cathartic.

40:36.830 --> 40:38.810
It's just as empty as the dreams.

40:39.950 --> 40:40.840
It's horrible.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.050
There's no...

40:44.580 --> 40:46.810
satisfaction. There's nothing.

40:49.340 --> 40:50.730
I know they talked to you.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.560
Now that the Covenant knows you're still alive,

40:54.340 --> 40:56.270
you might want to move again.

40:56.390 --> 40:58.310
Maybe somewhere outside of the country.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.180
No, I'm not gonna run any more.

41:00.330 --> 41:02.160
I'm gonna stay in Wisconsin.

41:03.620 --> 41:08.650
I don't know, maybe when I get back I'll... 
I'll ask out that painter.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.590
We're going to see each other again.

41:26.960 --> 41:27.820
I love you.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.470
You too.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.890
- Will !
- Yeah ?

41:41.100 --> 41:43.290
We never talked about that.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.000
I kinda like that.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.240
