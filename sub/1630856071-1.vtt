01:31.134 --> 01:33.658
<i>Temperatures plummeting down

<i>Chitwood takes the snap.
Beats off to Diggs,</i>

01:50.240 --> 01:51.633
Stop the car.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.505
Sorry. I beg your pardon, ma'am?

01:54.592 --> 01:55.898
Did you hear what I said?

01:57.856 --> 01:59.510
Uh, is everything okay
back there, ma'am?

01:59.597 --> 02:01.077
I said, "Stop the car."

02:02.470 --> 02:04.211
I got your drop-off
at Marshall's and 3rd, ma'am.

02:04.298 --> 02:07.388
Oh, my God! I said
pull the fucking car over.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.432
Now!

02:10.913 --> 02:11.957
Psycho.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.752
Don't touch me. Asshole.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.886
Michael, she got ideas.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.715
You know? She's thrown out
the Philippe Starck.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.456
No, the coffee table.

02:32.543 --> 02:34.197
Says it doesn't go
with her things.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.373
Are you kidding me?

02:36.460 --> 02:39.115
You should see this Golran rug
she brought with her.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.119
I don't know, Michael.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.077
I'm growing a fucking tumor
as we speak.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.294
-  Yeah.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.383
-  Yeah, five more.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.082
-  Three, two. Push!

03:33.169 --> 03:36.781
- One. One more. Okay, one more!

03:36.868 --> 03:39.306
- Yes! Fuck it, man!

03:41.830 --> 03:43.658
- You killed it, bro.
- Thanks, dude.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.889
- Hey. Sorry.
- Oh, my God!

05:24.976 --> 05:27.109
- What took you so long?
- Yo, come on!

05:27.196 --> 05:29.590
- Jesus. Fuck.
- My bladder
is fucking killing me.

05:34.508 --> 05:35.683
Yo, come on. You shouldn't
eat that shit.

05:35.770 --> 05:36.858
That's not good for you.

05:37.511 --> 05:40.905
As long as there's no
ground-up meat in here, I'm, uh,

05:40.992 --> 05:43.212
I'm gonna eat it.
I'm really hungry.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.692
I'm hungry all the time.

05:51.786 --> 05:52.830
Fuck her.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.354
Who?

05:55.093 --> 05:56.051
Janis.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.880
You pay my fucking
paycheck, bitch.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.535
I check-in. I work.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.886
I ring up customers'
shitty processed meats
and weird discount shit,

06:04.973 --> 06:08.280
they don't even need
but they buy anyway.
And I don't complain.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.371
I go back and I do it again
the next day. And you know
what she tells me?

06:11.458 --> 06:14.243
"Smile. Smile.
You're not smiling enough.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.810
You're putting off
the customers."

06:16.854 --> 06:18.552
Yeah. So, then just
fucking smile, okay?

06:18.639 --> 06:21.250
You shouldn't complain so much.
You got a good thing going.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.604
Yeah.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.045
Yeah. 'Sup?

06:38.963 --> 06:40.182
Pretty sweet, right?

06:40.269 --> 06:41.226
Yeah.

06:51.715 --> 06:52.673
God.

06:53.848 --> 06:57.025
Babies just get
to freak out about whatever
they fuckin' want to.

06:57.112 --> 07:00.332
Sometimes, I wanna
kick, and scream,
and freak the fuck out.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.075
Is this cute?

07:07.992 --> 07:10.691
Whatever. Who gets to decide
what babies like anyway?

07:10.778 --> 07:12.301
It's a fuckin' con.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.090
Do you wanna just
get out of here?

07:19.787 --> 07:21.092
Why?

07:21.179 --> 07:23.355
Because my feet hurt,
and I'm getting sweaty,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.532
and I just wanna go home,
and sit down.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.753
Yo. Yo, check this out.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.365
- Wha-- what does this do?

07:34.758 --> 07:36.064
It gets the milk out.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.892
No. Seriously?

07:37.979 --> 07:38.980
- Yeah.
- Like...

07:40.068 --> 07:41.504
- Yeah.
- Really?

07:41.591 --> 07:43.201
That's so fuckin' gross.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.639
- No, it isn't.
- Oh, it's a little gross.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.427
Yeah. I don't think
we need it.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.909
That's $285.14.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.825
- Are you kiddin' me? Fuck.

07:59.435 --> 08:00.392
Oh...

08:01.916 --> 08:03.570
Can you just take
this stuff off?

08:04.745 --> 08:06.311
I'd have to go get my manager.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.924
-  Okay. We'll wait.
-  <i>We would
like to remind you</i>

08:10.011 --> 08:11.491
<i>that our shopping hours tomorrow</i>

08:11.578 --> 08:14.319
<i>are from 7:00 a.m.
to 11:00 p.m.</i>

08:14.406 --> 08:16.931
- "Don't forget to smile."
- <i>Thank you,
and have a great day.</i>

08:25.722 --> 08:27.898
<i>Head east on Columbus Avenue,</i>

08:27.985 --> 08:29.813
- <i>then turn right on 4th Street.</i>
- Okay.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.207
- <i>In one mile, take the exit.</i>
- Got it.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.382
- <i>Then--</i>

09:33.007 --> 09:35.270
And sometimes I feel
like it doesn't fuckin' matter

09:35.357 --> 09:36.663
whether you have a job
or you don't

09:36.750 --> 09:38.926
'cause life could just
suck just as hard.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.231
You feel me, Ralphie?

09:41.015 --> 09:42.625
Yeah. Yeah.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.498
Oh, hey. I-I got some, uh,
some new stuff here.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.632
Let's see. I got, um...
Uh...

09:49.719 --> 09:51.503
- Vicodin, Percocet.
-  Yeah.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.940
I'll hook you up.
Whatever you want.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.376
Yeah, no. Just give me
the Percocet.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.073
- Percocet? Yeah, sweet.
- Yeah.

09:59.555 --> 10:02.210
Oh, hey. I got something
else for you. Look.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.038
Check it out.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.782
- It's the sneakers you wanted.
- Shit, man.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.871
- They're your size too, bro.

10:12.568 --> 10:13.917
Yo, maybe next month.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.441
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.662
Okay. Yeah, no sweat.
I'll just, um...

10:20.402 --> 10:21.664
I'll just--
I'll hold 'em for you.

10:21.751 --> 10:22.883
Yeah, next month.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.847
You good, bro?

10:33.197 --> 10:34.938
I mean, is, like,
everything good with you,

10:35.025 --> 10:38.463
or are you still working
that, uh, the maintenance gig?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.075
No, no. I'm just, like, uh...

10:41.815 --> 10:43.643
I'm just trying to keep
my options open right now.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.992
- Yeah?
- You know, I'm just, like,

10:46.210 --> 10:49.039
taking time to just be focused
and stay centered, you know?

10:49.126 --> 10:50.345
Yeah. Severance package

10:50.432 --> 10:51.868
- ain't worth shit anyways.
- Yeah.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.744
Hey. I, uh, I-I know
some, uh, some guys.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.050
What guys?

11:00.137 --> 11:01.922
It's like guys with money
and shit. Like--

11:02.009 --> 11:05.795
They like to, like--
like, help out guys like us.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.319
What, they're, like,
buddies of yours?

11:08.406 --> 11:12.062
Yeah. I-if you want, like,
you could meet 'em.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.542
- I mean, they helped me...
- Yeah.

11:13.629 --> 11:14.935
...get back on my feet.
So, yeah,

11:15.022 --> 11:16.414
- who knows?
- Yeah.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.720
- Alright?
- Yeah.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.767
Awesome. Alright.
Hey? Good work today.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.594
- Alright. Thanks, dude.
- Alright.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.684
I'll see you, Ralphie.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.165
<i>...talk about mowing the lawn.
Everybody knows about</i>

11:28.252 --> 11:30.733
<i>mowing the lawn, but who cares?
But if I talk about children...</i>

11:55.149 --> 11:56.106
Hey.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.720
What the fuck is wrong with you?

12:06.421 --> 12:07.857
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.079
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:36.799 --> 12:37.800
You okay?

12:45.547 --> 12:46.896
- Sorry.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.291
Where did you go?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.032
Nowhere.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.995
I went to the doctor
today. Just--

12:59.082 --> 13:01.519
He just, like, wants me
to get a bunch of tests.

13:01.606 --> 13:04.435
Oh, shit.
Tests are so expensive.

13:04.522 --> 13:08.396
You know, nothing was wrong.
Just... [exhales] routine.

13:09.527 --> 13:12.879
And for some reason,
I just, like,

13:13.967 --> 13:15.925
got scared or something.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.710
I don't know. I just started,
like, crying

13:18.798 --> 13:22.062
in the middle
of the doctor's office, like...

13:22.149 --> 13:24.586
like a broken tap.

13:25.848 --> 13:26.806
Why?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.070
I don't know.
It just happened.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.730
What, they-they didn't
tell you the cost, though?

13:46.869 --> 13:48.740
Do you still wanna go
through with it?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.047
Huh?

14:06.715 --> 14:08.412
-  Hey.
- Hey. How you doing, man?

14:08.499 --> 14:09.849
-  Yeah, okay.
-  Good to see you.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.329
Uh, guys, this is
my friend, Ralphie.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.331
Uh, Ralphie
t-these are the guys.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.290
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. How you doing, man?

14:16.377 --> 14:17.769
- Oh, hi. What's up?
- Okay.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.076
Good. Let's make
some room, guys. Scoot over.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.686
Hey. Uh, come, sit down.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.341
A buddy of Jason's
is a buddy of ours.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.736
Yeah, yeah. Right here.
But which are shrimp
and which are pork?

14:27.823 --> 14:29.042
I can't have shrimp.
I'm allergic.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.044
-  Ooh, yay, that's me.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.959
I don't know where to start.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.482
- Could you pass me
a shrimp, please?
-  Boys,

14:34.569 --> 14:35.787
you gotta try these wontons.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.267
Ralphie, make sure
they get some wontons.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.573
Here you go.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.141
I could get 'em
to fry up a steak

14:41.228 --> 14:42.620
if that's more your style.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.188
Oh, no, I'm good. Thanks. Yeah.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.800
Well, Ralph, I hope
you don't mind, Jason told us

14:48.888 --> 14:50.672
about you all
getting laid off at Brandt.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.066
-  Oh, yeah. So sorry.
-  Oh.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.982
It must be tough out there
for you guys, huh?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.331
Yeah. 'Cause I mean...

14:58.506 --> 15:00.464
Yeah, like, it happened
so fast, so...

15:02.727 --> 15:04.860
It's like one day,
you're up for a promotion,

15:04.947 --> 15:07.645
and the next day,
you're just, like,
out on your ass or whatever.

15:08.298 --> 15:11.867
Corporate America
does not give a fuck
about its human capital.

15:12.737 --> 15:13.956
It's like once
you're harvested,

15:14.783 --> 15:16.480
you're of no use
to anyone.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.221
Okay.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.833
So, Ralph,
do you have people
depending on you?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.400
Oh, yeah. Like, my girl.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.707
- Yeah.
-  Oh, right.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.883
He's expecting
a-a baby too. Right?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.276
- Wow.
-  A breeder.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.669
- Yeah.
-  But that's
a lot, though.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.889
Do you have any family
to fall back on?

15:36.283 --> 15:37.980
I'm just, like, trying
to stay positive now, man.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.417
- Of course.
- Just trying to keep
my options open right now.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.637
-  A blank slate.
I like that.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.815
Well, hey...

15:48.556 --> 15:49.513
Ralph...

15:51.515 --> 15:52.908
To keeping your options open.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.910
Ah. Hear, hear.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.305
- <i>Salud.</i>
- Thanks, thanks.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.337
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.773
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.904
- Sorry. I was just-- Yeah.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.297
- No.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.951
- You sure?
- Yeah, sorry. Yeah.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.085
- Uh...
- I was just, um... Yeah.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.350
I know they can be a handful,
but the guys mean well.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.875
I hope they didn't make you
too uncomfortable.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.182
No, no. It was cool. I mean...

16:50.357 --> 16:53.099
Yo, thanks for the beer
and whatnot. I mean,
I-I would have put in--

16:53.186 --> 16:54.274
Don't worry about it.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.843
Hey, I'm sorry
for your burdens, Ralph.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.412
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.588
I've been in some
tight spots myself.

17:04.675 --> 17:05.981
And, uh, you know...

17:07.722 --> 17:09.158
You have that look.

17:12.683 --> 17:13.728
What look?

17:15.208 --> 17:17.036
Like nobody ever
showed up for you.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.517
No one gave a damn.

17:23.259 --> 17:26.654
A lot of us here know
the pain of absent fathers.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.178
Helps knowing

17:30.310 --> 17:31.615
you're not alone, man.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.202
Hey, baby.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.857
Wake up, you're dreamin'.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.167
Bad dream?

18:04.257 --> 18:05.475
You want Tylenol?

18:05.562 --> 18:06.911
Uh... yeah.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.001
You wanna tell me about it?

18:28.194 --> 18:29.282
What's that?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.327
-  The tree?
-  Yeah.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.416
-  Got it in the closet.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.635
What closet?

18:34.722 --> 18:36.550
Your mom's closet
out the back.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.205
Why are you going through there?
That's personal.

18:39.292 --> 18:42.599
'Cause I'm trying to be a little
bit fuckin' festive, Ralphie.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.297
What do you want?
You just want me
to throw all that shit out?

18:44.384 --> 18:45.559
- There's good stuff in there.
- Yeah.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.169
I don't want you
messing around back there.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.910
- Jesus, Ralphie.
- I thought I remember
saying it.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.173
- Didn't I say it? Did I say it?
- Yeah, you said it.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.393
Do you want me to fucking take
the tree down?

18:56.613 --> 18:57.658
- Come here.

18:57.745 --> 18:58.963
-  No. No.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.401
Ralphie, cut it out.
Stop. Stop, Ralphie!

19:31.300 --> 19:33.084
-  Hey, uh, Ralphie.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.956
Yo, I got something for you.

19:38.307 --> 19:41.310
Yo, I told you, bro, I wanna
take those off your hands,
but money's tight.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.443
Yeah. All-all good.
They're on the house.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.228
It's just a gift
from the guys.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.709
I-I guess you made,
like, a good impression.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.365
It's pretty...
pretty sweet, right?

19:52.452 --> 19:53.366
Yeah.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.194
Pretty sweet.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.544
- Alright.
- I'll see you, Ralphie.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.850
- Thanks, bro.
- You're the man.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.970
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

20:33.057 --> 20:34.798
Alright, guys,
hustle up. Let's go.

20:34.885 --> 20:38.802
For the newcomers,
I'm Dad Dan.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.283
I guess you could say, uh...

20:43.111 --> 20:45.244
Three failed marriages

20:45.331 --> 20:46.984
taught me I'm not much
of a husband.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.206
But what I am...

20:51.293 --> 20:53.295
...is a family man.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.344
We have a few new faces today.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.826
You wanna introduce yourself?

21:04.698 --> 21:06.656
Yeah, I'm Ralph-- I'm Ralphie.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.180
Hi.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.573
Yeah. My-my buddy Ralphie

21:10.660 --> 21:12.227
is not much of a talker, Dan--

21:12.314 --> 21:13.533
uh, Dad Dan.

21:14.969 --> 21:17.580
My house is a safe space, Ralph.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.365
No judgment.

21:21.628 --> 21:24.195
We speak our truth here
without fear.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.331
I'm Son Aaron.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.551
A year,
four months celibate.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.686
I'm Son Jason. Uh...

21:37.426 --> 21:39.994
two months celibate.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.737
And I'm-I'm Son Brad.

21:43.824 --> 21:47.915
Um, 11 months and 13 days.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.351
Yeah.

21:49.438 --> 21:52.746
I-in fact, if, if I may,
Dad Dan, I'd like to...

21:52.833 --> 21:54.574
- I'd like to share.
- Mm-hmm.

21:55.879 --> 21:56.837
Uh...

21:57.707 --> 21:59.622
Sheesh.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.189
Here it goes. Um...

22:03.409 --> 22:09.502
Some of you know that, uh,
I was not in the best shape
when I was inducted.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.766
Had stage four liver cancer.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.944
And the doctor said
that I had six months.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.773
Well, uh,

22:19.860 --> 22:21.165
yesterday was...

22:22.515 --> 22:25.605
was one whole year
since my diagnosis.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.563
Oh, and still
going strong.

22:31.132 --> 22:34.875
Dad Leo here.
Just over six years
and still truckin'.

22:34.962 --> 22:38.139
Dad Zander. Going on ten years.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.968
Well, our mom
is kind of a junkie.

22:41.055 --> 22:44.319
So... it was either this
or the Army, I guess.

22:44.406 --> 22:48.541
Three years celibate.
Over the last two weeks, voluntary.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.153
Packed my bags and I left
my wife last night.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.851
I went through her things.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.158
There were pictures...

22:58.899 --> 22:59.943
Texts.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.600
She was fucking guys.
Random guys.

23:06.297 --> 23:10.127
What do you wanna
say to Emily, Cy?

23:10.214 --> 23:11.302
I'll say it.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.392
Cunt.

23:14.784 --> 23:15.785
That's what.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.092
She's a cunt.

23:25.708 --> 23:26.927
I'll be right back.

23:32.367 --> 23:35.196
Hey, Ralphie.
Did you get anything?
Can I get you anything?

23:35.283 --> 23:36.458
- Uh, no, no.
- Are you sure?

23:36.545 --> 23:37.807
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

23:39.983 --> 23:43.639
Fuck the labels,
you know? I'm not a...

23:43.726 --> 23:46.729
- I'm not a cheater.
I'm not a fuck boy.
- Yeah.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.951
But I'm not your doting
little boyfriend, you know?

23:51.038 --> 23:53.432
Abstinence is about taking
your power back.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.781
- Exactly.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.652
By the way, just send me
that recipe already.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.088
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.752
That's safe, alright?
As soon as he's free,
we're gonna get with him.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.712
Um, I have no idea what his--

24:12.799 --> 24:15.323
Dan, this is my buddy Rick
I was telling you about.

24:15.410 --> 24:18.674
Oh, Rick. Hey, man. I'm sorry
for your troubles, brother.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.111
Leo's been filling me in.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.811
You know, I've been...

24:25.899 --> 24:27.988
Hey, bro. Can you please
pick up your shit off the floor?

24:28.075 --> 24:30.033
-  I said
I'd pick it up later.
-  Dude, I've asked you,

24:30.120 --> 24:32.340
- like, three times.
-  I said
I'd pick it up, brother.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.212
Just pick up
your fuckin' shit. You could
just keep it on your bed,

24:35.299 --> 24:37.214
- or, or just--
- I don't--
I'll pick it up in a bit.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.608
It's there for a reason.
I don't care.
I'll just get around it.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.523
Man, if you have
a messy fucking room,

24:41.610 --> 24:44.352
you have a messy
fucking eternal life, bro.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.745
I don't care!

24:50.271 --> 24:52.578
-  What are you doing?
-  Picking your shit up.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.360
- That's the OG right there.
- Oh, shit.

25:36.447 --> 25:39.755
Original Glock, G17.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.759
It's as honest
as they come.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.979
- Oh, sorry about that. It's...

25:49.548 --> 25:50.853
- Yeah.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.203
You carry protection, son?

25:56.337 --> 25:57.773
You're vulnerable, you know?

25:59.383 --> 26:01.560
- Driving around...

26:01.647 --> 26:03.170
- Strangers at your back.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.694
- Yeah.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.131
Have a seat.

26:08.218 --> 26:09.829
I'm sure you have
some questions.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.664
Yeah. I mean...

26:19.403 --> 26:22.450
So, like, Jason
and the other guys, they...

26:22.537 --> 26:24.104
like, they live with you?

26:24.191 --> 26:27.586
They do, yeah.
You'd be surprised.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.371
- There are...

26:30.458 --> 26:33.504
...homes like ours
all over the state

26:33.592 --> 26:36.595
across the country, you know?

26:36.682 --> 26:38.901
- Just like regular families.
- Hmm.

26:39.946 --> 26:43.602
Except regular folks don't get
to choose their family.

26:43.689 --> 26:44.690
We do.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.782
You pick out a name yet?

26:52.872 --> 26:54.613
- For the baby.
- Oh.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.051
Yes. It's just, like,
my girl Sal,

26:58.138 --> 27:00.357
she doesn't wanna know
if it's, like, a girl
or a boy yet.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.099
What if it's a boy?

27:04.623 --> 27:05.885
I like Jayce.

27:08.757 --> 27:11.107
And Nancy for if it's a girl.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.814
Do you get lonely, Ralph?

27:25.644 --> 27:28.777
Angry for no good reason at all?

27:34.348 --> 27:36.176
What do you do
with those feelings?

27:40.093 --> 27:41.094
I mean...

27:47.448 --> 27:49.189
- Can I, um...
- Huh?

27:50.103 --> 27:52.409
Just relax. Just breathe.

27:52.496 --> 27:55.021
- Whoa. What?
- Just breathe.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.547
Breathe in.

28:02.637 --> 28:03.594
Out.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.251
One more time. Just like that.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.731
- In.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.300
- Out.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.393
You know, you could be a part
of our family.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.008
How would that work?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.447
It depends on you.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.890
There's a staggering
beauty in you.

28:39.630 --> 28:44.418
Cataclysmic power
to create, annihilate.

28:52.121 --> 28:53.514
- Bye, Ralphie!
- Bye!

29:17.277 --> 29:19.670
But I don't wanna go
to Zach's house.

29:20.497 --> 29:21.847
But I'm scared of the dog.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.588
And also the other thing.

29:25.851 --> 29:26.852
The thing...

29:28.418 --> 29:30.812
The thing that happened
when I couldn't make it
to the bathroom.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.990
I know, Ma. But it's just
hard for me, okay?

29:35.077 --> 29:36.644
It's just hard.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.171
What? No.
I'm not crying. I'm not.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.783
I wish you'd just let me
stay home this weekend.

29:47.611 --> 29:48.656
Bye, Mom.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.358
Your Ma
giving you a hard time?

29:58.884 --> 30:00.886
You gotta watch out, bro.

30:00.973 --> 30:02.365
Like saying stuff like that.

30:03.540 --> 30:04.498
Why?

30:05.194 --> 30:06.761
You gotta...

30:06.848 --> 30:09.982
You gotta hold back some. Okay?

30:10.634 --> 30:12.375
You gotta be tough up here.

30:14.464 --> 30:17.641
Bad thoughts will mess you up.
Are you hearing me?

30:18.512 --> 30:20.470
What kind of bad thoughts?

30:20.557 --> 30:23.386
You know, bad thoughts
like you can't go
to your friend's house

30:23.473 --> 30:25.301
without pissing your pants,
man. Come on.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.782
You gotta shut it down.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.785
Total annihilation, okay?

30:48.020 --> 30:49.238
Take care of yourself, buddy.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.190
- Season's greetings.
- Yeah. How much for this?

31:32.281 --> 31:33.892
Do you have password?
Do you have a charger?

31:37.678 --> 31:39.680
- Okay.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.800
Shit. You okay?

32:14.236 --> 32:17.500
Alright. Alright.
Stay, stay, stay.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.127
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

32:40.436 --> 32:41.960
- What is this?

32:42.047 --> 32:44.788
Yo, what does it look like?
Are you happy?

32:47.226 --> 32:48.227
Yeah.

32:49.097 --> 32:50.664
Really? You don't look happy.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.667
Did you make all of this
in one day?

32:53.754 --> 32:55.930
What, did you drive
to fucking Canada or something?

32:56.017 --> 32:59.020
Yeah. No. I mean, no.
I just, like--

32:59.107 --> 33:01.283
- There was this, like, kid.
- What kid?

33:01.370 --> 33:02.850
There was, like,
a little kid in the car.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.895
I mean, who I was driving
in the car, and he, like...

33:06.897 --> 33:08.682
You know, he kinda, like,
left his phone in the car.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.553
But he can get another one.
So, it's not a big deal.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.990
- Ralphie!
- What?

33:12.860 --> 33:14.209
You stole some kid's phone?

33:14.296 --> 33:16.255
No, I didn't steal his phone.
I was, like--

33:16.342 --> 33:18.431
I was actually, like,
helping him, Sal, okay?

33:18.518 --> 33:20.433
I was helping him.
Like I'm helping you.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.130
- Me?
- Yeah, man! You said

33:22.217 --> 33:24.263
you needed money for, like,
doctor's visits. It's for test--

33:24.350 --> 33:26.352
- Ow! Fuck!
- Grow up, Ralphie!

33:26.439 --> 33:29.007
This baby that you
begged me to keep

33:29.094 --> 33:31.705
is going to pop out of me
any day now,

33:31.792 --> 33:34.838
and it's gonna be puking
and shitting all over our lives,

33:34.925 --> 33:36.449
and I'm trying
to hold it all together

33:36.536 --> 33:38.538
and create, like,
this picture of us.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.453
You know, you, me,
and the baby as a family,

33:40.540 --> 33:41.889
and I can't fucking do that.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.108
And I can't fucking do that

33:43.195 --> 33:44.631
because you're not
fucking there.

33:55.511 --> 33:58.775
-  <i>No.</i>
-  <i>I will not pale for you.</i>

33:58.862 --> 34:01.169
-  No.
-  I will not bend for you.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.607
-  No.
- I will not break for you.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.046
-  No.
- I created fire,

34:08.133 --> 34:09.656
and I will take it back.

34:09.743 --> 34:12.485
I invented steel,
and I will take it back.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.314
I discovered the sun,
and I will take it back.

34:15.401 --> 34:17.925
- Mine.
- I will take what is mine,

34:18.012 --> 34:21.537
what has always been mine,
and what will always be mine.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.713
- Mine.
- Not yours.

34:24.845 --> 34:27.630
- Mine.
- Not yours.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.937
- Mine.
- Not yours.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.515
Son Brad.

34:43.472 --> 34:44.473
Son Jason.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.607
Son Aaron.

34:50.218 --> 34:51.219
Son Drew.

34:52.786 --> 34:53.830
Son Paul.

34:55.832 --> 34:56.877
Dad Leo.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.232
Come into the circle, Ralphie.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.321
Come, come, come.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.107
In the circle,

35:10.456 --> 35:13.372
we'll face the anger

35:15.374 --> 35:16.418
and the hurt.

35:18.681 --> 35:21.684
Pain that holds us back.

35:21.771 --> 35:25.471
As it is for you,
so it was for all of us.

35:25.558 --> 35:26.820
-  As it is for you...
- Hmm.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.604
...so it was
for all of us.

35:28.691 --> 35:29.997
-  Now, close your eyes.
-  As it is for you,

35:30.084 --> 35:31.738
so it was for all of us.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.261
-  Just close your eyes.
- Yeah.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.220
...so it was
for all of us.

35:35.307 --> 35:38.136
-  And breathe. May I?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.789
-  Just breathe.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.620
As it is for you,
so it was for all of us.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.405
- As it is for you...
- Why are you here, Ralph?

35:49.408 --> 35:51.105
Um...

35:51.192 --> 35:52.411
I lost my job.

35:52.498 --> 35:53.673
-  Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.935
And Lord knows that...

35:55.022 --> 35:57.111
it could break
a man's spirit.

35:57.198 --> 35:58.243
-  Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:58.330 --> 35:59.418
- Yeah.
- Close your eyes.

35:59.505 --> 36:00.419
Mm-hmm.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.726
- What else?

36:03.813 --> 36:04.771
Um...

36:05.902 --> 36:07.165
Like, um...

36:08.383 --> 36:09.297
baby.

36:10.603 --> 36:12.692
Uh, the baby's gonna be here
pretty soon, so...

36:12.779 --> 36:14.346
-  Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.304
-  That's a lot of weight.
- Yeah.

36:17.697 --> 36:20.352
Who's going to put clothes
on that baby?

36:21.527 --> 36:23.268
Who's going to feed that baby?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.233
Keep dropping down
into that feeling.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.018
-  Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Follow that.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.717
What is it?

36:37.804 --> 36:40.328
No respect.

36:40.415 --> 36:41.547
No respect.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.638
Who won't respect you?

36:45.725 --> 36:48.118
- Your girlfriend?
-  Mm-mm.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.294
- Hmm?
-  Mm-mm.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.734
- Don't hold back.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.258
- Now, don't fear
what's inside you.

36:57.345 --> 37:00.043
- Don't fear.
- No, no, no, no, no.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.481
- What's inside you, boy...

37:02.568 --> 37:03.612
...can't hurt you.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.921
- Let's go.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.968
Speak up. Speak up, Ralph.

37:12.055 --> 37:13.405
- Ralph?

37:13.492 --> 37:15.015
-  Yeah.
- Speak up.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.147
- What is it?
What's the feeling?

37:17.235 --> 37:18.932
- Follow the feeling.
-  It makes me...

37:19.019 --> 37:20.673
It makes me, um...

37:23.110 --> 37:24.503
It makes me mad.

37:25.504 --> 37:27.854
- Good. Say it again.
- Yeah. It makes me mad.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.464
- Good.

37:29.551 --> 37:32.380
- It makes me so mad!
- Yes. Now, drop down into that.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.034
- Drop down into that.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.514
What's on the other
side of that?

37:35.601 --> 37:37.516
No!

37:37.603 --> 37:40.997
No! No! No!

37:41.084 --> 37:44.262
No, no!
No, no! No, no!

37:45.045 --> 37:48.266
No, no! [sobs] No!

37:57.971 --> 37:59.320
Have you told
your girlfriend yet?

38:01.191 --> 38:02.280
Told her what?

38:02.367 --> 38:03.585
That you're
dumping her ass.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.069
I mean, it's up
to you. But, um...

38:09.765 --> 38:12.333
I mean, most guys
just up and disappear
after their induction.

38:13.421 --> 38:14.466
Easier that way.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.512
-  Ralphie.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.166
Ralphie, come over here.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.342
Come over here. Come on.

38:22.604 --> 38:23.997
Hey, bro.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.128
Are you okay?

38:26.042 --> 38:27.087
Yeah, I guess.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.611
You went pretty hard
back there.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.091
W-wild.

38:32.658 --> 38:35.617
You know, w-when I did it,
I kinda, like, half-assed
the whole thing.

38:35.704 --> 38:38.446
- Kinda lame, but whatever.

38:39.578 --> 38:40.753
Wait. Did I do it wrong?

38:40.840 --> 38:42.537
No, no. Bro, no. Um...

38:44.713 --> 38:47.150
Just, I-- I-I don't know.
Just, like, uh...

38:47.237 --> 38:49.936
-  Ralph.
- Watch out for yourself, okay?

38:50.023 --> 38:52.852
And this here is Garfield.
He's thinking about
joining the fold.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.767
Hey, man. Y-you're
welcome here anytime.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.986
- Alright. I'ma
call you G, alright?
- Alright.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.466
- Alright? You're welcome here.
- Please. Thank you, sir.

38:58.553 --> 38:59.554
Yeah. Of course.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.817
You know, today was, uh...

39:02.775 --> 39:04.603
Today was Ralph's
first confessional.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.432
We got a live wire here, Z.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.434
A real live wire.

39:09.521 --> 39:10.826
Good for you, Ralph.

39:10.913 --> 39:12.567
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.411
-  That's $9.50.

39:34.633 --> 39:35.547
Thanks.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.090
Hey. You okay there, buddy?

39:57.917 --> 40:02.095
- Yeah.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.447
Change the music
for us, Tammy.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.189
So we can dance,
we can move, we can exercise.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.366
Alright, guys.
Just for a little bit.

40:12.453 --> 40:14.890
-  Ah, thank you.

40:14.977 --> 40:18.285
-  Yes,
Tammy! Tammy!
-  You're welcome, boys.

40:18.372 --> 40:21.201
Hey, Tammy.
What the fuck? Are you--
are you kidding me?

40:21.288 --> 40:22.985
- What are you doing?

40:23.072 --> 40:24.247
Just do what's right.

40:24.944 --> 40:27.076
-  You gonna
give me shit?
- Yeah, I'm giving you shit.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.209
What-what are you doing,
you're just letting them
run your gym?

40:29.296 --> 40:30.602
What do you
want me to do?

40:30.689 --> 40:32.081
Fucking change it back!

40:51.971 --> 40:54.626
Hey. Hey, man.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.584
You come to make
friends?

40:59.326 --> 41:00.370
Okay, then.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.503
Just a look.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.680
We like for look, not so-so.

41:07.029 --> 41:08.466
You like what you need to see.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.294
Yeah. I just figure...

41:13.645 --> 41:16.212
I just figure you could show
some more respect, bro.

41:19.477 --> 41:24.612
Just wants to make sure
that he has my attention.

41:25.134 --> 41:26.919
- Get the fuck off me!
- Hey!

41:27.006 --> 41:29.095
-  Get the fuck
off me, bro!

42:36.728 --> 42:37.642
Uh-huh.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.644
<i>Are you okay?</i>

42:40.383 --> 42:42.864
Yeah. I'm just, like, um...

42:44.257 --> 42:45.345
still working.

42:47.913 --> 42:52.178
<i>Okay. Should I get
a ride with Janis?</i>

42:54.615 --> 42:55.660
- <i>Ralphie?</i>
- Yeah.

42:57.792 --> 42:59.446
<i>Well, I'll see you
at home, I guess.</i>

43:01.883 --> 43:02.797
<i>Right?</i>

43:05.278 --> 43:06.235
<i>Ralphie?</i>

44:24.574 --> 44:27.273
Drop off at 275 Argyle.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.867
Fuck!

44:58.217 --> 44:59.174
Uh...

45:00.349 --> 45:03.048
Hey, uh, buddy...

45:05.441 --> 45:09.271
Hey, buddy, is everything okay?
What-what's going on here?

45:10.751 --> 45:11.709
Hey.

45:12.622 --> 45:13.885
- Hey.
- I said, "Hey!"

45:14.320 --> 45:16.191
- Drive the fucking car.
- Do you-- do you have
a problem?

45:17.802 --> 45:19.455
You think
he doesn't speak English?

45:19.542 --> 45:20.805
Um...

45:20.892 --> 45:22.589
- No. This is absurd.
- I know.

45:24.634 --> 45:27.289
-  What is your problem?

45:27.376 --> 45:29.030
You know what?
I bet I know
what your problem is.

45:31.032 --> 45:32.033
He's so...

45:33.295 --> 45:35.167
It is literally
freezing out there.

45:38.561 --> 45:41.260
I'm not fucking freezing
my ass off.

45:41.347 --> 45:42.652
- Hey, I just--

45:44.654 --> 45:46.265
-  Shit! Hey, hey!
-  What the fuck?

45:46.352 --> 45:47.875
- Stop!
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey, Hey, hey.

45:47.962 --> 45:49.137
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

45:49.224 --> 45:50.225
Please, please,
please, please. Stop.

45:52.401 --> 45:54.360
-  Sir, I'm sorry.
-  Slow fucking down!

45:54.447 --> 45:56.666
What are you doing?
What the fuck?

45:56.754 --> 45:58.407
- Stop!
- Hey, hey.

45:58.494 --> 46:01.628
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. No!
- Get him to-- Get him to stop!

46:05.632 --> 46:07.025
- Hey, hey, stop the car!
- Oh, my goodness!

46:07.112 --> 46:08.896
- Stop!
- Hey, hey! Stop the car!

46:08.983 --> 46:11.290
- Stop! Stop the car.
- Stop the car!

46:11.377 --> 46:13.509
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry.
Just please stop the car.

46:13.596 --> 46:16.164
- Please. Please stop the car!
- For Christ's sake,
dude, please!

46:16.251 --> 46:17.731
- Hey! No, no, no!

46:17.818 --> 46:19.341
Hey! Pull over!

46:20.778 --> 46:22.475
Where'd you go, Ralphie?

46:34.792 --> 46:37.620
I know we both come
from shitty places.

46:43.148 --> 46:45.890
But I don't think sharing
the same pain is enough.

46:49.502 --> 46:51.156
I don't think it ever was.

46:55.769 --> 46:58.380
And, baby, one of these days,

47:00.078 --> 47:01.906
you might not recognize me.

47:03.995 --> 47:06.649
Because I'm letting
all of my pain go.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.742
I'm putting it in a bottle.

47:14.353 --> 47:17.182
And I'm sending it
down the river out to sea.

47:24.537 --> 47:26.060
- It's nice. You like it?
- Yeah.

47:26.931 --> 47:29.324
Yeah. It's Ralph Lauren.
What's not to like?

47:30.238 --> 47:31.631
I mean, i-it looks good, bro.

47:31.718 --> 47:33.851
The color definitely suits you.

47:33.938 --> 47:36.897
Yeah. No, no. I'll, like--
I'll, like, definitely
think about it.

47:36.984 --> 47:38.507
Well, what's to think about?

47:38.594 --> 47:40.161
If you like the shirt,
you should have the shirt.

47:46.428 --> 47:47.952
- Ralph?
- Yeah.

47:48.953 --> 47:50.258
Can I buy you the shirt?

47:51.520 --> 47:53.435
Hey, fuck it!
It's Christmas, right?

47:54.610 --> 47:56.525
- Let me buy you the shirt.
- Hey. Maybe he just
wants to, like,

47:56.612 --> 47:58.919
check out some other stores
before he decides.

48:00.312 --> 48:01.748
Yeah. No, no. I got it.
Yo, I got it.

48:15.631 --> 48:16.894
Cash or card?

48:19.157 --> 48:22.551
If I'm a venture
capitalist, right,
and I wanna make some money...

48:22.638 --> 48:23.683
Yeah, okay, alright.

48:23.770 --> 48:24.814
Bradley?

48:29.602 --> 48:31.256
-  Alice.
-  Oh, my God.

48:31.996 --> 48:35.086
Uh, wow. Wow. What are
you doing here?

48:35.173 --> 48:36.652
Where have you been?

48:36.739 --> 48:38.524
- I thought something--
-  Hey, keep it together.

48:38.611 --> 48:41.048
- I thought something
happened to you.
- Hey, you coming?

48:41.831 --> 48:43.616
-  Um...
-  Who are these...

48:43.703 --> 48:45.313
- Who are these men?
-  You guys should just--

48:45.400 --> 48:47.098
- You should go on.
- Brad?

48:48.012 --> 48:49.013
Bradley.

48:51.450 --> 48:52.538
I'll catch up.

48:55.454 --> 48:56.498
Whoa.

48:58.761 --> 49:00.807
-  Save a seat.
-  W-what's... Wh...

49:00.894 --> 49:02.809
- What's going on?
- She seems really upset.

49:02.896 --> 49:04.811
Yeah. She's devastated.

49:04.898 --> 49:06.856
- No, no, no, no, don't!

49:06.944 --> 49:10.686
Look at him.
Groveling to spare her feelings.

49:11.905 --> 49:13.211
Why do we do that, Ralph?

49:14.342 --> 49:16.605
Why do we make ourselves
so much smaller than we are?

49:23.656 --> 49:24.700
No, you need to--

49:25.310 --> 49:26.528
Stop it!

49:27.399 --> 49:30.663
-  What the fuck
is wrong with you!?
-  Where did you go!?

49:31.403 --> 49:32.970
- You okay, bro?

49:33.057 --> 49:35.624
No.
I'm such an asshole.

49:35.711 --> 49:38.236
- What?
- I'm such an asshole.
I've been so bad.

49:38.323 --> 49:40.629
No, no, no. I've been
so bad. Oh, shit.

49:40.716 --> 49:42.718
- I'm an asshole.
I'm an asshole.
- What are you talking about?

49:42.805 --> 49:44.720
I'm an asshole. I can't afford
this shit. I can't afford
this fucking shit.

49:44.807 --> 49:46.896
- We can fucking return it,
man! Easy!
- Close ranks. Move.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.811
- We can just return it, man.
- No, no, no. I can't afford it.

49:48.898 --> 49:50.422
- It's easy...
- What's going on?

49:50.509 --> 49:52.685
- I'm such a fucking asshole.
- Hey, hey!

49:52.772 --> 49:54.643
- What's going on with you?
- I don't know. I don't know.

49:54.730 --> 49:56.341
- I don't know.
- What, you bought this shirt?

49:56.428 --> 49:57.516
- Why'd you buy this shirt?
- I don't know. I don't know.

49:57.603 --> 49:59.518
- What?
- I don't know. I don't know...

49:59.605 --> 50:00.910
You spend 200 dollars
on a shirt that you can't
even fucking afford?

50:00.998 --> 50:02.260
- I don't know.
I'm a fuckin' asshole.
- Why?

50:02.347 --> 50:03.391
I don't know!
'Cause I'm a fuckin' asshole!

50:03.478 --> 50:04.914
No, no, no! Fuck this shit, man!

50:05.002 --> 50:06.264
Hey! You're awesome, bro!

50:06.351 --> 50:08.005
You're not a fuckin'
asshole, okay?

50:08.092 --> 50:09.832
- You're not an asshole, man!
- Hey! Don't puff up.

50:09.919 --> 50:11.486
Back down. Fucking back down.

50:11.573 --> 50:12.966
Let the real men
do the thinking.

50:13.053 --> 50:14.359
- You calm down.
- No, no, no, no.

50:14.446 --> 50:15.447
- Hey!
- What?

50:15.534 --> 50:16.796
You think you're an asshole?

50:17.623 --> 50:19.016
Answer me. You think
you're an asshole?

50:19.103 --> 50:20.278
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

50:20.365 --> 50:21.714
Why don't you do
something about it?

50:23.455 --> 50:26.588
Do something about it.
This world's a fucking
trash can!

50:26.675 --> 50:28.025
Teaming with assholes!

50:28.895 --> 50:31.289
Huh? Do something about it!

50:31.376 --> 50:32.942
Take back your power, Ralph!

50:48.828 --> 50:50.003
Yeah, fuck you.

51:40.140 --> 51:41.620
What the fuck? Come on!

51:44.536 --> 51:46.059
What the fuck--

52:47.686 --> 52:49.688
<i>Head straight on...</i>
- Fuck, come on!

52:49.775 --> 52:51.951
<i>Then in two miles,
take the exit.</i>

52:53.213 --> 52:54.214
<i>Then turn right...</i>

53:05.269 --> 53:06.270
Fuck off!

53:42.262 --> 53:43.742
-  <i>Keep that
nice, tall lift.</i>

53:43.829 --> 53:45.874
-  <i>And then lower down.</i>

53:45.961 --> 53:48.094
<i>One thing
I love to do with squats,</i>

53:48.181 --> 53:51.445
<i>especially squats
during pregnancy
is little pulses.</i>

53:51.532 --> 53:54.405
<i>I'm gonna show you
how to do those.
So, it's good control.</i>

53:54.492 --> 53:56.102
<i>Exhales. Lifting up partway.</i>

53:56.189 --> 53:58.365
- <i>Inhale. Controlling down.</i>

53:58.452 --> 54:00.933
<i>Really
feeling the tops
of your legs working,</i>

54:01.020 --> 54:03.196
<i>the underneath of those legs,
those glutes working.</i>

54:03.283 --> 54:05.372
<i>'Cause it's really important
during pregnancy</i>

54:05.459 --> 54:07.983
- <i>to keep those glutes strong--</i>

54:08.070 --> 54:09.028
Hey.

54:17.384 --> 54:19.430
Are you not getting
enough attention?

54:25.392 --> 54:26.306
Hey.

54:48.546 --> 54:50.591
Baby, you really gotta tell me
what's going on here

54:50.678 --> 54:53.377
because this silence
is fucking killing me.

54:58.686 --> 54:59.905
Ralphie?

55:06.041 --> 55:08.653
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

55:08.740 --> 55:11.656
Why are you putting on cologne
that I fucking bought you?

55:11.743 --> 55:14.572
Are you making yourself
look nice for someone?

55:14.659 --> 55:18.445
Are you going out?
Are you fucking
going out right now?

55:18.532 --> 55:19.968
- Ralphie!

55:20.055 --> 55:22.362
Fucking talk to me!
What the fuck are you--

55:22.449 --> 55:26.192
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
There is a staggering
beauty in me, okay?

55:26.279 --> 55:29.456
A cataclysmic power
to create and annihilate.

55:30.370 --> 55:31.502
- "Annihilate"?
- Yeah.

55:31.589 --> 55:33.199
What the fuck
are you talking about?

55:33.286 --> 55:34.722
You wanna fucking annihilate--

55:35.506 --> 55:37.638
Hey, Ralphie! Ralphie,
Ralphie, no!

55:39.727 --> 55:42.774
Baby,
open the door!

55:42.861 --> 55:45.864
-  Ralphie! Come on!

55:45.951 --> 55:48.432
Fucking open
this fucking door, man.

55:49.737 --> 55:51.739
Ralphie, hey!

55:55.743 --> 55:58.224
Big, strong man, huh?

55:58.311 --> 56:00.835
You're too scared to look me
in the fucking eye!

56:00.922 --> 56:03.360
- Get back here, fucker!

56:03.447 --> 56:06.450
I'm not raising
this fucking kid alone!

56:06.537 --> 56:09.409
Ralphie, I'm not fucking
doing this! I swear to God.

56:09.496 --> 56:11.890
Don't fucking walk out
on me, Ralphie.

56:24.729 --> 56:26.644
-  <i>The oldest and...</i>

56:26.731 --> 56:29.168
- ...the wisest god...

56:31.475 --> 56:36.088
said, "Hide the treasure
in man himself,

56:36.175 --> 56:37.959
because that, my friends,

56:38.830 --> 56:41.659
- is the last place
you'll ever find it."
-  Whoo!

56:47.229 --> 56:49.144
It's time now

56:50.276 --> 56:52.931
to welcome a new brother
to the fold.

56:54.019 --> 56:55.150
Son Ralph.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.370
Please.

57:05.552 --> 57:06.684
With this pain,

57:07.902 --> 57:09.469
you, Son Ralph,

57:09.556 --> 57:11.776
will be released
from gynosphere.

57:12.690 --> 57:13.778
"With this pain,

57:14.474 --> 57:17.738
I, Son Ralph,
will be released
from gynosphere."

57:18.609 --> 57:20.741
Purified and reborn.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.744
"Purified and reborn."

57:23.831 --> 57:25.790
To be your own master.

57:25.877 --> 57:27.661
"To be my own master."

57:27.748 --> 57:29.707
And a son of Manodrome.

57:30.534 --> 57:32.579
"And a son of Manodrome."

57:56.734 --> 57:59.171
-  Up. Pull him up.

58:01.434 --> 58:03.871
-  No!
-  I will not pale for you.

58:03.958 --> 58:06.091
-  No.
- I will not bend for you.

58:06.178 --> 58:08.093
-  No.
- I will not break for you.

58:08.180 --> 58:10.617
-  No.
- I created fire,
and I will take it back.

58:10.704 --> 58:12.967
I invented steel,
and I will take it back.

58:13.054 --> 58:15.361
I discovered the sun,
and I will take it back.

58:15.448 --> 58:17.058
-  Mine!
- I will take what is mine,

58:17.145 --> 58:20.192
what has always been mine,
what will always be mine.

58:20.279 --> 58:21.628
- Not yours.
-  Mine!

58:21.715 --> 58:23.195
- Not yours.
-  Mine!

58:23.282 --> 58:24.501
Not yours!

58:27.852 --> 58:29.636
-  Cheese!

59:00.275 --> 59:02.713
I got
a... a cute car.

59:15.726 --> 59:16.727
Take it.

59:18.380 --> 59:20.426
- You want it, don't you?

59:21.819 --> 59:24.909
Take the rounds. Load the mag.

59:35.310 --> 59:36.660
A gun is just a tool.

59:36.747 --> 59:39.924
It's a crude expression
of what's inside.

59:43.275 --> 59:47.279
Do you remember what I told you
the first day you came here?

59:49.020 --> 59:51.022
- Yeah.
- What did I tell you?

59:54.329 --> 59:55.417
There is...

59:56.897 --> 59:59.160
a staggering beauty in me.

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:03.991
A cataclysmic power

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.169
to create and annihilate.

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:24.229
Dad Dan?

01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:29.538
Yes, Ralph.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.024
My old man left me
on Christmas Day

01:00:39.853 --> 01:00:41.376
when I was just a kid.

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:47.948
He left me there
to take care of my mom alone.

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.041
But what if I'm just...

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:57.871
broken?

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:02.963
But what if I'm just
broken inside?

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:06.924
You were broken.

01:01:09.622 --> 01:01:13.670
It happened to a sweet,
defenseless child.

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:21.068
If I could, I would tear
that scoundrel limb from limb.

01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:25.594
But it's not up to me.

01:01:33.907 --> 01:01:37.737
You have to raise an army
inside yourself.

01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:41.523
Avenge that kid.

01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:45.266
You have to fix him...

01:01:47.094 --> 01:01:49.749
so that no one hurts him
ever again.

01:01:52.665 --> 01:01:53.840
Whatever you do,

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:56.234
you don't let him down.

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:01.282
You don't let that
baby boy down.

01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:12.598
- Face it.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:16.645
- Face it.

01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:19.213
Show your pain.

01:02:28.527 --> 01:02:29.833
There is no God...

01:02:31.312 --> 01:02:32.400
but Ralph.

01:02:36.709 --> 01:02:37.754
Say it.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.147
"There is no God

01:02:41.235 --> 01:02:42.584
but Ralph."

01:02:42.671 --> 01:02:45.326
There is no God but Ralph.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.460
There is no God...

01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:51.245
"There is no God..."

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:53.204
...but Ralph.

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:56.685
"...but Ralph."

01:02:57.338 --> 01:02:58.992
There is no God but Ralph.

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:01.952
"There is
no God but Ralph."

01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:15.139
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:15.226 --> 01:03:18.098
Hey, hey, bro.
Where are you taking
your stuff? Hey!

01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:23.538
Hey, Ralphie!
Where the fuck
are you going, man?

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:25.889
- Ralphie! Hey.

01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:28.587
- What the fuck?

01:03:39.424 --> 01:03:41.426
- What are you doing?
- Fu--

01:03:41.513 --> 01:03:42.819
- Open the door, man!

01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:44.429
- Fuck it!

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:56.571
Hey! Hey! Ralphie!

01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:46.360
Yeah.

01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:48.754
Still looking.

01:04:50.364 --> 01:04:51.583
Still hungry.

01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:56.327
I remember one won with me
and taking the touch on the day.

01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:59.373
Can you say? The land fat.

01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:01.941
- But it'll be empty.

01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:04.465
Nothing on the inside.

01:07:44.843 --> 01:07:45.887
Hey.

01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:40.420
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

01:08:50.909 --> 01:08:52.824
- Yo, yo, wait. Wait, wait.

01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:54.826
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Yeah.

01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:57.002
Okay? My man?

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:58.743
- Yeah.
- You got this.

01:08:59.918 --> 01:09:01.398
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:01.485 --> 01:09:02.790
- You trust me?
- Yeah.

01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:05.097
- You trust me?
- Yeah.

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:10.276
- Okay, okay.

01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:11.886
- It's okay.

01:10:10.031 --> 01:10:11.337
I didn't catch your name.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.774
Ralphie.

01:10:18.997 --> 01:10:20.085
I'm Ahmet.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.481
You hungry?

01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:28.006
I know a place we can
go to get some--

01:11:17.142 --> 01:11:20.014
It's not working.
What am I doing wrong?

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:21.712
You just need
to relax, ma'am.

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:25.672
How am I meant to relax
in this situation?

01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:27.718
I understand. The little guy
picks up on your stress, though.

01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:30.590
So, you need to stay calm
so he can be calm.

01:11:30.677 --> 01:11:33.376
Now, support his head.
Here you go.

01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:34.855
And try not to force it.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:46.911
-  Sal.

01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:50.741
Sal!

01:12:05.582 --> 01:12:06.539
Hey.

01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:09.194
Merry Christmas, Mommy.

01:12:10.848 --> 01:12:12.066
You wanna hold him?

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:14.504
Nah.

01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:28.213
- Uh, you changed your hair?

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.388
Yeah. What do you think?

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.477
I think it looks nice.

01:12:33.914 --> 01:12:35.742
Thought it might be
time for a change.

01:12:39.224 --> 01:12:41.226
You wanna sing some carols
or something?

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.491
What?

01:12:45.578 --> 01:12:47.580
For Jayce. He might like it.

01:14:24.764 --> 01:14:25.722
No.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.426
Sal?

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.475
Sal.

01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:10.201
Sal!

01:15:13.465 --> 01:15:14.422
Sal!

01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:16.903
Are you Ralphie?

01:15:19.471 --> 01:15:21.560
- I have your baby.

01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:23.475
His mama said
you'd be home soon.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.067
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

01:17:24.465 --> 01:17:25.510
You guys home?

01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:28.644
Come on in.

01:17:33.692 --> 01:17:34.737
Look who made it.

01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:37.087
It's the Uber man.

01:17:38.436 --> 01:17:39.480
Hey, everyone.

01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:47.663
Sorry I left.

01:17:49.012 --> 01:17:49.926
Ralph.

01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:53.233
Merry Christmas, Ralph.

01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:55.453
Merry Christmas, Ralph.

01:17:56.454 --> 01:17:57.629
Thanks.

01:17:57.716 --> 01:17:59.196
We weren't sure
you'd be back.

01:17:59.283 --> 01:18:00.676
Is that allowed?

01:18:02.199 --> 01:18:04.070
I see you brought
someone with you.

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:06.943
Yeah. This is Jayce.

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:09.293
Is he yours?

01:18:11.338 --> 01:18:12.426
Where's his mother?

01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:15.125
Gone.

01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:16.343
Of course she is.

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:27.964
May I?

01:18:34.013 --> 01:18:34.927
Okay.

01:18:36.973 --> 01:18:37.974
Okay.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.327
Okay.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.852
Big guy. Oh, look at you.

01:18:48.332 --> 01:18:49.376
Here you go, buddy.

01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:51.378
Oh, you're a big boy.

01:18:51.465 --> 01:18:53.598
- Big boy like your daddy.

01:18:53.685 --> 01:18:55.208
- Yeah.
- Aren't you?

01:18:55.295 --> 01:18:58.646
- Hey, hey! We're here!

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:02.085
- Sorry we're late.
Traffic was murder.
- ...plate for Ralph. Ralph?

01:19:02.172 --> 01:19:03.913
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.566
Merry Christmas.
The stuffing is out
of this world.

01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:07.220
- For you, sir.
-  Oh, thank you.

01:19:07.307 --> 01:19:09.701
Oh, Ralph.
I didn't realize you were here.

01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:12.399
- We didn't bring you
anything. I'm sorry.

01:19:12.486 --> 01:19:14.662
Ooh. Hello. Who is this?

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.273
Whose does it look like?

01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:18.318
Is this yours?

01:19:19.363 --> 01:19:21.626
Crazy what's happening
outside, huh?

01:19:21.713 --> 01:19:23.367
- What's that?
-  What do you mean?

01:19:23.454 --> 01:19:26.718
Cops in the street talking
to the neighbors. It's wild.

01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:29.808
Look at this guy. Wow.

01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:48.479
Jason called this morning.

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:52.875
The police were around the gym
looking for you.

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:57.183
They found your car, Ralph.

01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:00.796
A man is dead.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.277
Yeah?

01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:10.631
And do the others know?

01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:16.246
Oh.

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:25.342
Shit.

01:20:32.175 --> 01:20:33.437
- Help me.
- Hey.

01:20:33.524 --> 01:20:35.613
- Help me.
- Steady, boy. Come on.

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.137
- Take it easy. Hey! Hey!

01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:40.226
Just keep-- Look at us.
We're here.

01:20:40.313 --> 01:20:42.533
Look at me.
Look at your brothers.
We're here, Ralph.

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.361
- We're here. You see?
We're here.
- We're here, Ralph.

01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:46.885
- It's okay, Ralph. It's okay.
- Hey, we're here, Ralph.

01:20:46.972 --> 01:20:48.278
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:48.365 --> 01:20:50.410
- Is he gonna kill us?
- No.

01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:53.413
- He's gonna tell us.
- Tell us what?

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.588
Right, Ralph?

01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:56.677
What comes next.

01:20:57.635 --> 01:20:58.941
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

01:21:00.029 --> 01:21:02.031
Okay? Okay?

01:21:03.293 --> 01:21:05.164
- Come on, boy.

01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:07.601
- There you go.

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:10.866
-  Good.

01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:12.998
Oh, fuck.

01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:17.176
-  Help me, help me.

01:21:17.263 --> 01:21:19.178
- Stay calm, everyone.

01:21:19.265 --> 01:21:20.614
- Calm.
- Alright. Now,
tell 'em to get down.

01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:21.702
- Get down.
- Yeah.

01:21:21.789 --> 01:21:24.488
Everyone, let him think.

01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:26.751
-  Just--
You got this, kid.

01:21:26.838 --> 01:21:27.883
- Yeah.

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:29.145
What you decide

01:21:29.232 --> 01:21:30.624
will be the only thing there is.

01:21:30.711 --> 01:21:33.410
- It comes down to this.

01:21:33.497 --> 01:21:34.541
Okay, Ralph?

01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:36.543
Hey, Dad Dan?

01:21:37.631 --> 01:21:38.894
When you look at me...

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.333
- what do you see?

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:47.903
I see a brutal, tender giant

01:21:49.121 --> 01:21:50.862
punching holes in the sky.

01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:53.734
I am Son Ralphie.

01:21:54.344 --> 01:21:55.911
Yes, Ralphie.

01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:57.869
-  Police! Open up!

01:22:04.136 --> 01:22:05.181
Hey, Dad Leo?

01:22:06.095 --> 01:22:07.139
Yeah, Ralph.

01:22:11.535 --> 01:22:13.537
Would you please
take Jayce upstairs?

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:18.846
-  Hey! Sir!

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:22.067
- Sir! Hey! Hey! Open up!

01:22:22.154 --> 01:22:24.026
Oh, shit.
He's coming 'round the back.

01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:26.942
- What the--

01:22:37.822 --> 01:22:38.779
No.

01:22:41.217 --> 01:22:42.870
I will not pale for you.

01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:44.785
No.

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:47.353
I will not bend for you.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:48.964
No.

01:22:49.051 --> 01:22:50.835
I will not break for you.

01:22:50.922 --> 01:22:52.054
No.

01:22:52.141 --> 01:22:54.621
I created fire,
and I will take it back.

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:57.450
I invented steel,
and I will take it back.

01:22:58.147 --> 01:23:00.584
I discovered the sun,
and I will take it back.

01:23:00.671 --> 01:23:01.933
Mine.

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.717
I will take what is mine,

01:23:03.804 --> 01:23:06.503
what has always been mine,
and what will always be mine.

01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:07.678
Mine.

01:23:07.765 --> 01:23:08.896
-  Not yours--

01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:23.955
- Forgive me.

01:23:24.042 --> 01:23:26.958
- Drop the gun!

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.374
<i>...news. Local police
are warning residents</i>

01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:53.724

<i>...announce that they stay

01:26:44.808 --> 01:26:45.852
Can I help you?

01:26:54.121 --> 01:26:55.210
Easy, guy.

01:26:57.777 --> 01:26:59.214
What is your name?

01:27:00.737 --> 01:27:02.913
Ralph. Ralphie.

01:27:04.175 --> 01:27:06.264
Nice to meet you, Ralphie.

01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:08.092
My name is Sachiel.

01:27:08.179 --> 01:27:10.573
- I'd like to help you, Ralphie.

01:27:13.663 --> 01:27:15.012
Will you let me do that?

01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:14.289
You know, my old man
was a fisherman.

01:28:15.812 --> 01:28:18.815
His whole life, he fished,
or so I'm told.

01:28:20.164 --> 01:28:23.689
I wouldn't know because there is
only one memory I have of him.

01:28:25.169 --> 01:28:26.866
I was two years old.

01:28:26.953 --> 01:28:29.086
And for some reason, my old man

01:28:29.173 --> 01:28:32.002
thought to take me with him
out to sea that day.

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.222
I must have lost my balance

01:28:36.093 --> 01:28:37.616
'cause I fell overboard.

01:28:39.052 --> 01:28:40.489
So, there I was.

01:28:42.665 --> 01:28:45.015
Going underwater and coming up.

01:28:45.102 --> 01:28:46.712
Going under and coming up.

01:28:48.105 --> 01:28:49.976
And every time I came up,

01:28:50.934 --> 01:28:54.024
I did see the boat was getting
farther and farther away.

01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:58.507
The last time I went under,

01:28:59.290 --> 01:29:00.596
I thought to myself,

01:29:02.424 --> 01:29:04.774
"I don't know
if I'll be coming up again."

01:29:06.863 --> 01:29:09.953
But I must have, because
the next thing I remember

01:29:11.302 --> 01:29:12.956
is the sight of my old man

01:29:14.131 --> 01:29:17.439
dive into the ice cold water,
and swim in my direction.

01:29:20.398 --> 01:29:23.575
The last time
I went under, I thought,

01:29:25.447 --> 01:29:26.665
"Hang in there, guy.

01:29:27.927 --> 01:29:30.321
He'll surely be here
any moment now."

01:29:32.018 --> 01:29:33.933
When they pulled me
back in their boat,

01:29:34.543 --> 01:29:37.502
there was two things
I knew for certain that day.

01:29:39.504 --> 01:29:41.550
The one was,
I knew what death was.

01:29:43.029 --> 01:29:44.335
Plain and simple.

01:29:45.989 --> 01:29:48.818
Another thing was,
I loved my old man.

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:53.866
I loved him like a rock.
