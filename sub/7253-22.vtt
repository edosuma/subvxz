11:49.750 --> 11:52.753
than my first husband

11:52.795 --> 11:54.506
or second husband.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.633
But he's neck and neck

11:54.548 --> 11:56.633
with the third one, though.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.302
- Okay.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.302
- Bye, Paul Anka!

11:59.344 --> 12:02.597
Thank you for letting me

11:59.344 --> 12:02.597
scratch your butt for an hour!

12:02.639 --> 12:04.516
Just like

12:02.639 --> 12:04.516
husband number four.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.684
[chuckling]

12:05.724 --> 12:06.685
Bye.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.104
[clock ticking]

12:15.402 --> 12:18.279
(Mitchum)

12:15.402 --> 12:18.279
'...be there for at least

12:15.402 --> 12:18.279
the first two months.'

12:18.321 --> 12:20.407
(Logan)

12:18.321 --> 12:20.407
'He runs the department,

12:18.321 --> 12:20.407
so he's the one to see.'

12:20.448 --> 12:22.116
'He's a good guy.'

12:20.448 --> 12:22.116
He's got funny..'

12:22.158 --> 12:23.410
(Mitchum)

12:22.158 --> 12:23.410
'Um, I got to go.'

12:23.451 --> 12:26.663
- Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.663
- Yeah.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.081
- Yeah?

12:26.705 --> 12:28.081
- Hey.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.083
- What happened?

12:28.122 --> 12:30.083
- It took longer than I thought.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.292
(Rory)

12:30.124 --> 12:31.292
Way longer,

12:30.124 --> 12:31.292
and I've got to leave

12:31.334 --> 12:33.044
for my grandparents

12:31.334 --> 12:33.044
like right now.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.547
To top it off, just as the

12:33.086 --> 12:35.547
family thing is winding down

12:35.589 --> 12:37.591
a bunch of dad's

12:35.589 --> 12:37.591
business automatons came by

12:37.632 --> 12:38.757
and he made me stay

12:37.632 --> 12:38.757
to talk shop.

12:38.799 --> 12:39.800
To talk shop.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.428
Synergy and new media ventures

12:41.469 --> 12:43.263
in increasing

12:41.469 --> 12:43.263
shareholder value.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.515
- I could hear my soul dying.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.515
- He's doing this on purpose.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.934
- I wouldn't put it past him.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.934
- Why is he doing this?

12:47.975 --> 12:50.562
Look, don't think about him.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.562
Just go, go to your thing.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.938
Get it over with.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.938
I'll wait for you here.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.022
- Go.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.022
- Okay.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.107
No more thoughts about Mitchum.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.191
You're right. No more thoughts.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.276
Go.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.282
(Mitchum)

13:00.071 --> 13:02.282
'Yeah. At this number.'

13:02.323 --> 13:03.866
Here, call me back. Bye.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.918
Oh. Hello, Rory.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.633
Were you at the ceremony?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.633
We didn't see you.

13:19.674 --> 13:20.841
Yeah, I was there.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.176
Ah.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.219
We didn't see you.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.680
Well, I was there.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.223
Did you know that

13:25.722 --> 13:27.223
Logan and I had plans

13:27.265 --> 13:28.433
to go out after the ceremony?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.017
I mean, were you aware of that?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.437
- No, I was not.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.437
- Yeah.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.439
'Cause why would your son want

13:32.479 --> 13:34.439
to go out with his girlfriend

13:34.481 --> 13:36.399
the last day

13:34.481 --> 13:36.399
before he leaves, right?

13:36.441 --> 13:37.692
Rory..

13:37.734 --> 13:38.735
And this gathering of yours

13:38.777 --> 13:39.902
it turns into a business meeting

13:39.944 --> 13:41.571
on his graduation day?

13:41.613 --> 13:43.615
'As if Logan's not gonna have

13:41.613 --> 13:43.615
enough time for that'

13:43.657 --> 13:45.784
'during the year you're

13:43.657 --> 13:45.784
forcing him to do in London.'

13:45.824 --> 13:47.702
It wasn't exactly

13:45.824 --> 13:47.702
a business meeting.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.329
- Why are you doing this?

13:47.744 --> 13:49.329
- Doing what?

13:49.370 --> 13:51.080
Why are you taking him

13:49.370 --> 13:51.080
away from me. Why?

13:51.122 --> 13:53.333
- Do you hate me that much?

13:51.122 --> 13:53.333
- I don't hate you.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.793
- Yeah, right.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.793
- Why would I hate you?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.461
Because I'm dating your son.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.172
Logan's love life is his own

13:56.503 --> 13:59.172
business. I don't get involved.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.716
Oh, please. You have done

13:59.213 --> 14:01.716
nothing but get involved.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.259
'How?'

14:03.301 --> 14:05.470
You're sending him away,

14:03.301 --> 14:05.470
5,000 miles away.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.388
What other reason is there

14:05.512 --> 14:07.388
but to separate us?

14:07.430 --> 14:09.516
Well, you flatter yourself if

14:07.430 --> 14:09.516
you think I put that much energy

14:09.557 --> 14:10.975
into thinking

14:09.557 --> 14:10.975
about your relationship.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.143
Here's the lobby.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.812
Wait! Let's get this clear

14:12.185 --> 14:13.812
right now.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.522
I'm sending Logan away

14:13.852 --> 14:15.522
for one reason

14:15.563 --> 14:17.482
because it is time.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.482
It is time for him

14:17.524 --> 14:19.818
to stop jumping out of planes

14:17.524 --> 14:19.818
in a gorilla mask

14:19.859 --> 14:22.779
and crashing boats and getting

14:19.859 --> 14:22.779
plastered every night

14:22.821 --> 14:24.197
and ending up

14:22.821 --> 14:24.197
in the hospital.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.573
It's time for him

14:24.238 --> 14:25.573
to stop being a child

14:25.615 --> 14:27.200
and to start being a man.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.619
It's time for him to start

14:27.241 --> 14:29.619
focusing on his future

14:29.661 --> 14:31.078
and the only way

14:29.661 --> 14:31.078
he is gonna do that

14:31.120 --> 14:32.747
is to get him

14:31.120 --> 14:32.747
out of his environment

14:32.789 --> 14:34.999
and away from those dopes,

14:32.789 --> 14:34.999
Colin and Finn

14:35.041 --> 14:38.461
and the life and death brigade,

14:35.041 --> 14:38.461
and get him on a path.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.962
Logan is talented.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.962
He's talented.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.715
He's my son.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.715
I want him to achieve something.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.216
And he needs a push.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.802
It...It's what

14:43.257 --> 14:45.802
my father did with me.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.261
He pushed me, I grew up

14:47.303 --> 14:49.096
and now Logan

14:47.303 --> 14:49.096
is gonna grow up.

Just tell them

17:11.698 --> 17:14.074
what it is, Richard.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.285
Well, it looks like

17:14.116 --> 17:16.285

17:56.034 --> 17:57.451
- 'Of you.'

17:57.493 --> 17:59.245
And look right here.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.121
My friend attached a placard

17:59.286 --> 18:01.121
to the front of the building.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.416
The Rory Gilmore

18:01.163 --> 18:03.416
astronomy building.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.001
Um, grandpa--

18:05.043 --> 18:06.544
They're going to start

18:05.043 --> 18:06.544
construction this summer

18:06.586 --> 18:08.254
so it should be up

18:06.586 --> 18:08.254
and running by Christmas.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.214
Is this

18:08.295 --> 18:10.214
the actual lettering?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.633
- I mean, is this the scale?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.633
- I don't know.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.761
Although the style

18:12.675 --> 18:14.761
is very dignified.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.055
I'm sure we can request

18:14.802 --> 18:17.055
this lettering if you like.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.723
It's your building, so why not?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.934
Because the lettering

18:18.765 --> 18:20.934
would be 30 feet high.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.476
Well, honey,

18:20.975 --> 18:22.476
it's the astronomy building.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.020
You have to be

18:22.518 --> 18:24.020
able to see it from space.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.688
I don't know

18:24.062 --> 18:25.688
whether it's to scale.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.481
Well, is there someone

18:25.730 --> 18:27.481
we can call to check?

18:27.523 --> 18:29.817
Relax, Rory.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.817
She's so modest.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.444
Relax, Rory.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.863
Remember when you wanted

18:31.485 --> 18:33.863
a personalized license plate?

18:33.905 --> 18:35.322
So much better.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.991
We're going to try

18:35.364 --> 18:36.991
to get them to add another floor

18:37.033 --> 18:39.243
so that it's taller

18:37.033 --> 18:39.243
than everything around it.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.995
Make it stand out

18:39.285 --> 18:40.995
a bit more.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.205
- More than this?

18:41.037 --> 18:43.205
- I love the portrait idea.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.707
- Who's not helping?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.707
- Hmm?

18:44.749 --> 18:47.167
Excuse me, everyone.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.167
Christopher Hayden has arrived.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.420
- Ah, Christopher.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.420
- How wonderful. Come in.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.297
- Come in.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.297
- W-what are you doing here?

18:51.338 --> 18:53.716
- I was invited.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.716
- Shut up. Me too!

18:53.758 --> 18:55.635
We promised Christopher

18:53.758 --> 18:55.635
a home cooked meal last time

18:55.676 --> 18:58.178
we saw him, and since

18:55.676 --> 18:58.178
we're leaving for Europe

18:58.220 --> 19:00.306
for the next two months,

18:58.220 --> 19:00.306
this was the last chance

19:00.347 --> 19:01.766
we had to make

19:00.347 --> 19:01.766
good on that promise.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.059
You can call

19:01.808 --> 19:03.059
a Gilmore many things

19:03.101 --> 19:05.185
but you can't

19:03.101 --> 19:05.185
call him a welsher.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.605
What<i> are</i> the things you can call

19:05.227 --> 19:07.605
him, just for future reference?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.482
I'm very grateful

19:07.647 --> 19:09.482
for the invitation, Emily.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.400
- Martini, Christopher?

19:09.523 --> 19:11.400
- Sounds good.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.402
- What's this?

19:11.442 --> 19:13.402
- Oh, it's Rory's building.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.821
- It's not my building.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.821
- It's got your name on it.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.948
Wow, are those letters to scale?

19:16.990 --> 19:18.783
- Oh, boy.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.783
- 'Cause it's gonna be huge.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.493
Yeah. Okay, dad.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.954
You can take my seat

19:20.534 --> 19:22.954
because I have to go

19:22.996 --> 19:24.455
legally change my name

19:22.996 --> 19:24.455
and transfer to Brown.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.832
Honey, now come on.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.001
We have teased you

19:25.873 --> 19:28.001
way worse than this before.

19:28.042 --> 19:31.420
Remember when you were 10

19:28.042 --> 19:31.420
and thought<i> you</i> discovered U2?

19:31.462 --> 19:33.464
I should get going.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.464
Logan's leaving in the morning.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.800
Oh, that's right. Well, tell him

19:33.506 --> 19:35.800
to have a safe trip.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.802
- I will.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.802
- My goodness.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.138
It's Grand Central Station

19:37.844 --> 19:40.138
in here tonight.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.181
Come on, Rory.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.181
I'll walk you out.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.599
- Bye, honey.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.599
- Bye.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.852
- Christopher.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.852
- Thank you.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.311
- So, he's leaving, huh?

19:45.893 --> 19:47.311
- Yeah.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.896
He's going to London

19:47.353 --> 19:48.896
to work for his dad.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.564
She should be

19:48.938 --> 19:50.564
very proud of that boy.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.233
She should. She should

19:50.606 --> 19:53.233
buy him an observatory.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.028
Well, look

19:53.275 --> 19:55.028
who I found outside.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.155
- Oh. Carolyn.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.155
- Hello, Richard.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.656
How wonderful to see you

19:58.698 --> 20:00.324
especially standing

19:58.698 --> 20:00.324
so close to a martini.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.826
[chuckling]

20:00.366 --> 20:01.826
Oh, Carolyn.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.410
That sense

20:01.868 --> 20:03.410
of humor of yours.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.163
One martini

20:03.452 --> 20:05.163
coming right up.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.414
Carolyn,

20:05.204 --> 20:07.414
this is my daughter, Lorelai.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.208
Lorelai,

20:07.456 --> 20:09.208
this is Carolyn Bates.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.878
- "Lynnie" to those in the know.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.878
- Oh, am I in the know?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.171
- Well, you are now.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.171
- Nice to meet you.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.797
- You too.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.797
- And, Lynnie.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.799
- This is Christopher Hayden.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.799
- Nice to meet you.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.719
- Lynnie, olives or a twist?

20:16.841 --> 20:19.719
- Olives, please.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.220
Lynnie's mother

20:19.760 --> 20:21.220
and I go so far back

20:21.261 --> 20:22.889
I'm embarrassed

20:21.261 --> 20:22.889
to talk about it.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.516
Lorelai, you remember

20:22.930 --> 20:25.516
my talking about Marie Randle.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.727
- We were roommates in college.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.727
- Uh-huh.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.730
Well, Lynnie is her daughter,

20:27.768 --> 20:30.730
and she just moved to Hartford

20:30.771 --> 20:32.565
so, of course,

20:30.771 --> 20:32.565
we promised her a dinner.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.858
And since we're

20:32.606 --> 20:33.858
going to be out of town

20:33.900 --> 20:35.193
for the

20:33.900 --> 20:35.193
next couple of months

20:35.234 --> 20:37.111
tonight seemed like

20:35.234 --> 20:37.111
the perfect opportunity.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.488
Tonight she's settling up

20:37.153 --> 20:39.488
all old debts, huh?

20:39.530 --> 20:40.907
Lynnie,

20:39.530 --> 20:40.907
I've got your two olives.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.492
Thank you very much, Richard.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.535
- Move.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.535
- What?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.745
- Move.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.745
- Ow, mom!

20:45.786 --> 20:46.829
The arm's

20:45.786 --> 20:46.829
supposed to be connected

20:46.871 --> 20:48.081
to the rest of the body.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.373
Lynnie, sit down

20:48.122 --> 20:49.373
next to Christopher.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.416
Lorelai's gonna sit with me.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.043
- Okay.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.043
- 'You know..'

20:52.085 --> 20:54.461
Lynnie is a psychologist.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.461
Isn't that fascinating?

20:54.503 --> 20:56.505
I do a lot of work

20:54.503 --> 20:56.505
with family counseling.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.340
Runaways

20:56.547 --> 20:58.340
and drug recovery.

20:58.382 --> 21:02.344
- Arm-yanking rehab. Ow!

20:58.382 --> 21:02.344
- Lynnie moved here from Maine.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.097
Isn't that interesting?

21:02.386 --> 21:04.097
I've never been to Maine.

21:04.138 --> 21:05.806
Christopher,

21:04.138 --> 21:05.806
have you ever been to Maine?

21:05.848 --> 21:08.893
- Uh, no, but I like lobster.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.893
- Well, then, you're in.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.353
[laughter]

21:11.395 --> 21:12.813
I tell you,

21:11.395 --> 21:12.813
Lynnie, you're a card

21:12.855 --> 21:14.565
just like your mother.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.483
Christopher, you should meet

21:14.607 --> 21:16.483
her mother. She's a stitch.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.111
(Emily)

21:16.525 --> 21:18.111
'Isn't Lynnie's mother

21:16.525 --> 21:18.111
a stitch, Richard?'

21:18.152 --> 21:20.404
She's an entire seam, Emily.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.323
It's so important to find

21:20.446 --> 21:23.323
someone who can make you laugh.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.244
I was always so envious

21:23.365 --> 21:26.244
of Johnny Carson's wives.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.787
I just thought

21:26.285 --> 21:27.787
these women must do

21:27.828 --> 21:29.914
nothing but laugh all the time.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.291
- How's your drink, Lynnie?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.291
- Oh. Very potent.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.751
- Thank you, Emily.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.751
- Well.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.878
Potent is good

21:33.793 --> 21:35.878
because tonight is a party.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.797
Which reminds me, Christopher..

21:37.838 --> 21:39.215
Lynnie once threw her mother

21:39.257 --> 21:41.383
the most wonderful

21:39.257 --> 21:41.383
birthday party.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.344
I think she made the cake

21:41.425 --> 21:44.344
herself, didn't you, Lynnie?

21:44.386 --> 21:46.764
'Oh, these days

21:44.386 --> 21:46.764

21:46.806 --> 21:48.557
'is a rare treasure, isn't she?'

Officer Ruskin,

22:33.894 --> 22:36.230
what took you so long?

22:36.272 --> 22:38.440
- I called you hours ago.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.440
- Well, I'm here now, Taylor.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.151
- What do you need?

22:38.482 --> 22:40.151
- Handcuff these ruffians.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.944
- And take them away.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.944
- In what?

22:41.986 --> 22:44.613
- In your car.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.613
- Well, I came on my bike.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.324
- Why?

22:44.655 --> 22:46.324
- Ah, Fred took the car.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.284
- Plus my handcuffs are broken.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.284
- Well, then.

22:48.326 --> 22:52.163

Well, then, line them up

22:56.167 --> 22:57.835
and have them

22:56.167 --> 22:57.835
follow you to jail.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.920
Well, I could do that,

22:57.877 --> 22:59.920
but it's a single cell, though.

they won't go away.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.309
Taylor!

23:10.764 --> 23:13.309
How'd you let this happen?

23:13.351 --> 23:16.229
- This is my turf, Taylor!

23:13.351 --> 23:16.229
- How did I let this happen?

23:16.270 --> 23:17.771
This is<i> your</i> fault.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.773
You had to go off

23:17.813 --> 23:19.773
and make it in the big time

23:19.815 --> 23:21.399
and now they're

23:19.815 --> 23:21.399
all copying you.

23:21.441 --> 23:24.195
The big time?

23:21.441 --> 23:24.195
I made 700 bucks and got booed.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.155
And I never

23:24.237 --> 23:26.155
even met Neil Young.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.574
Heart of gold, my ass.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.534
I suddenly feel very tired.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.911
Would you like a tiramisu?

23:31.952 --> 23:34.580
No, I think I'd just

23:31.952 --> 23:34.580
like to go to bed.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.541
Tell everybody

23:34.621 --> 23:37.541
to try and keep it down.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.168
God, I hate music.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.672
♪ A beaver ate my thumb ♪

23:43.714 --> 23:46.175
♪ A beaver ate my thumb ♪

23:46.217 --> 23:48.510
♪ A doctor gave me rum ♪

23:48.552 --> 23:51.097
♪ 'Cause a beaver

23:48.552 --> 23:51.097

23:51.138 --> 23:53.891
- How old?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.891
- Uh, four going on forty.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.851
And a doll.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.851
A living doll.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.561
Well, enjoy them

23:55.893 --> 23:57.561
while their legs are still

23:57.603 --> 23:59.021
short enough

23:57.603 --> 23:59.021
for you to overtake them.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.564
That's good advice, doc. Thanks.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.358
Excuse me, I'm just

24:00.606 --> 24:02.358
gonna go to the restroom.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.817
Well, hurry back.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.817
Dinner's almost on.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.152
Yes, ma'am.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.363
My sister just

24:05.194 --> 24:07.363
had twins last week.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.282
Twins?

24:07.405 --> 24:09.282
Wow, that sounds--

24:09.323 --> 24:11.825
- Loud?

24:09.323 --> 24:11.825
- Exactly.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.328
I'm sorry,

24:11.867 --> 24:14.328
I know I'm being very forward

24:14.370 --> 24:16.205
but the picture

24:14.370 --> 24:16.205
of the two of you sitting there

24:16.247 --> 24:18.374
so young, so beautiful..

24:18.416 --> 24:20.500
It's almost like

24:18.416 --> 24:20.500
looking at a shampoo ad.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.256
Oh, my God.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.256
What are you doing?

24:25.298 --> 24:26.715
What do you mean,

24:25.298 --> 24:26.715
what am I doing?

24:26.757 --> 24:28.134
I thought "restroom"

24:26.757 --> 24:28.134
was code for "follow me

24:28.175 --> 24:29.927
and we'll talk about

24:28.175 --> 24:29.927
how to get you out of this."

24:29.969 --> 24:31.595
What the hell kind

24:29.969 --> 24:31.595
of spy school did you go to?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.264
Oh, well, I'm here now,

24:31.637 --> 24:33.264
so let's figure out

24:33.306 --> 24:34.556
how to get me out of this.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.849
- Out of what?

24:34.598 --> 24:35.849
- What do you mean?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.559
"Out of what?"

24:35.891 --> 24:37.559
This is a setup.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.852
So it seems.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.438
I can't believe

24:38.894 --> 24:40.438
Emily would do this.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.981
You're talking about

24:40.478 --> 24:41.981
Emily Dickinson, right?

24:42.022 --> 24:43.565
'Cause Emily Gilmore

24:42.022 --> 24:43.565
was<i> made</i> to do this.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.401
I thought I was

24:43.607 --> 24:45.401
having dinner with you and Rory.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.278
I didn't realize

24:45.443 --> 24:47.278
I was going on a date.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.904
Well, luckily you

24:47.320 --> 24:48.904
didn't get ugly overnight.

24:48.946 --> 24:49.989
And thanks

24:48.946 --> 24:49.989
a lot, by the way.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.449
- What did I do?

24:50.030 --> 24:51.449
- Nothing!

24:51.489 --> 24:53.326
You're sitting there,

24:51.489 --> 24:53.326
you're not saying anything.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.952
What are you

24:53.367 --> 24:54.952
talking about?

24:54.994 --> 24:57.163
When mom said, "doesn't

24:54.994 --> 24:57.163
he look like Cary Grant?"

24:57.204 --> 24:58.289
I said, "yes".

24:58.331 --> 24:59.373
You're just

24:58.331 --> 24:59.373
letting this happen.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.666
I'm not just

24:59.415 --> 25:00.666
letting this happen.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.293
You can't see that

25:00.707 --> 25:02.293
I'm miserable out there?

25:02.335 --> 25:03.752
No, I can't.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.752
You seem fine.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.379
- You're talking to her.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.379
- She's talking to me.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.755
What am I supposed to do?

25:05.421 --> 25:06.755
Slap her in the mouth?

25:06.797 --> 25:08.548
That would be

25:06.797 --> 25:08.548
a conversation stopper.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.010
I assumed at some point you'd

25:08.590 --> 25:11.010
jump in and try and save me.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.386
- By doing what?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.386
- I don't know..

25:12.428 --> 25:14.305
Deflect, distract,

25:12.428 --> 25:14.305
get the conversation

25:14.347 --> 25:15.848
off her and me and us.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.391
I'm sorry. I didn't know

25:15.889 --> 25:17.391
you needed saving.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.227
- Oh, come on.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.227
- "Oh, come on"?

25:20.269 --> 25:21.603
How do I know

25:20.269 --> 25:21.603
you don't want to date her?

25:21.645 --> 25:22.813
You're single. She's single.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.148
You're pretty. She's pretty.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.858
It's how all

25:24.190 --> 25:25.858
great divorces start.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.401
How did I used

25:25.899 --> 25:27.401
to get out of here?

25:27.443 --> 25:28.610
- What're you talking about?

25:27.443 --> 25:28.610
- In high school..

25:28.652 --> 25:29.695
I'd be in your room,

25:28.652 --> 25:29.695
I had several ways

25:29.736 --> 25:30.779
of sneaking out of here.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.198
Chris!

25:32.239 --> 25:33.573
Which drainpipe was it

25:32.239 --> 25:33.573
that I used to crawl down?

25:33.615 --> 25:34.992
Christopher!

25:35.034 --> 25:36.576
I think I used to get out

25:35.034 --> 25:36.576
from the attic window.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.828
Does the attic window

25:36.618 --> 25:37.828
still access the drainpipe

25:37.870 --> 25:39.163
that drops you off

25:37.870 --> 25:39.163
by the garage?

25:39.205 --> 25:41.081
You do know

25:39.205 --> 25:41.081
you're grown up now.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.833
You can just walk out

25:41.123 --> 25:42.833
the front door.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.668
If I just leave,

25:42.875 --> 25:44.668
I'll insult your parents.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.837
But vanishing into

25:44.710 --> 25:46.837
thin air, way more polite.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.465
It's only 8 o'clock.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.465
This night's gonna last forever.

25:49.507 --> 25:52.550
We haven't even

25:49.507 --> 25:52.550
had dinner yet.

25:52.592 --> 25:55.179
Relax. Now that I know

25:52.592 --> 25:55.179
you're not interested in her..

25:55.221 --> 25:56.514
- I'm not!

25:55.221 --> 25:56.514
- Okay.

25:56.554 --> 25:58.516
Now that I know,

25:56.554 --> 25:58.516
I can help you out.

25:58.556 --> 26:01.768
- You will?

25:58.556 --> 26:01.768
- Yeah, I got your back.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.729
- Okay, thank you.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.729
- You're welcome.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.647
- I know you always got mine.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.647
- Always.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.360
So, it wasn't code,

26:07.274 --> 26:09.360
you know. I gotta..

26:09.402 --> 26:11.278
Yes, right. I'll see you

26:09.402 --> 26:11.278
back in the living room.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.696
Yeah.

26:17.575 --> 26:18.576
Very interesting dinner, Emily.

26:18.618 --> 26:19.912
(Emily)

26:18.618 --> 26:19.912
'It's paella.'

26:19.953 --> 26:21.872
I got the recipe

26:19.953 --> 26:21.872
from Hilde Macintosh

26:21.914 --> 26:23.249
whose son

26:21.914 --> 26:23.249
married a Spanish girl.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.750
God knows how long

26:23.290 --> 26:24.750
it's going to last

26:24.791 --> 26:26.877
but the food at their

26:24.791 --> 26:26.877
wedding was wonderful.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.337
- Do you like it, Lynnie?

26:26.919 --> 26:28.337
- Mmm. I do.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.256
- Not too spicy?

26:28.379 --> 26:30.256
- I like spicy food.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.673
Do you? Well, Christopher..

26:31.715 --> 26:33.217
Did you hear that?

26:33.259 --> 26:34.843
Lynnie likes

26:33.259 --> 26:34.843
spicy food, and so do you.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.053
Isn't that something?

26:36.095 --> 26:38.097
Uh, yes. Small world.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.932
Hey, Lynnie,

26:38.138 --> 26:39.932
I have a recurring dream

26:39.973 --> 26:42.600
where a walrus

26:39.973 --> 26:42.600
waddles up, lies down on me

26:42.642 --> 26:44.061
falls asleep,

26:42.642 --> 26:44.061
and I can't breathe.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.521
- What do you think it means?

26:44.103 --> 26:45.521
- Lorelai..

26:45.563 --> 26:47.064
What, dad?

26:45.563 --> 26:47.064
Lynnie is a psychologist.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.108
- She should know.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.108
- It's okay, um..

26:49.149 --> 26:50.650
It could mean

26:49.149 --> 26:50.650
a myriad of things..

26:50.692 --> 26:52.152
Too much stress at work.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.862
Something in your

26:52.194 --> 26:53.862
life is strangling you.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.531
You've read "Alice

26:53.904 --> 26:55.531
in Wonderland" too many times.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.074
- Touche, Lynnie.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.074
- She's got wit and wisdom.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.784
- This one.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.784
- You know.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.660
Christopher does the Sunday

26:58.825 --> 27:00.660
"New York Times" puzzle

27:00.702 --> 27:02.538
every single week.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.957
Hey, what's it called

27:02.580 --> 27:04.957
when you're afraid of spiders?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.750
- Arachnophobia.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.750
- You have arachnophobia?

27:06.792 --> 27:08.419
- No.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.419
- Thank goodness.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.087
What's it called

27:08.461 --> 27:10.087
when you're afraid of people

27:10.129 --> 27:11.130
who are afraid of spiders,

27:10.129 --> 27:11.130
'cause that one I've got.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.798
Oh, lord.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.758
I don't think there's

27:12.839 --> 27:14.758
a technical term for that yet.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.803
How about arachnophobia phobia,

27:14.800 --> 27:17.803
'cause that makes sense.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.597
You know,

27:17.844 --> 27:19.597
Christopher, Lynnie--

27:19.637 --> 27:21.265
Voices in your head,

27:19.637 --> 27:21.265
totally normal, right?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.016
- Excuse me?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.016
- There's only two..

27:23.058 --> 27:25.394
- That speak English.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.394
- Lorelai, eat your paella.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.438
So, Christopher,

27:25.436 --> 27:27.438
how's business going?

27:27.480 --> 27:29.064
It's really been

27:27.480 --> 27:29.064
picking up lately.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.484
- What do you do?

27:29.106 --> 27:31.484
- Oh, I'm in computer software.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.776
- That sounds exciting.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.776
- Can be.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.445
It's a lot

27:32.818 --> 27:34.445
of traveling, actually.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.947
I love traveling. It's one thing

27:34.487 --> 27:36.947
I really miss about my job.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.241
You know what I think

27:36.989 --> 27:39.241
is even better than traveling?

27:39.283 --> 27:41.659
Time-traveling.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.659
Do you think that's possible?

27:41.701 --> 27:43.496
I would have no idea.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.038
Lorelai, are you having

27:43.537 --> 27:45.038
some kind of breakdown?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.790
You're very quiet, Christopher.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.042
- Well, I, uh--

27:46.832 --> 27:49.042
- Lynnie, as a psychologist..

27:49.084 --> 27:50.503
Tell me, what do you

27:49.084 --> 27:50.503
think of "The Sopranos"?

27:50.544 --> 27:52.045
Mm, actually,

27:50.544 --> 27:52.045
I miss Adriana.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.047
- Oh, so do I.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.047
- Lorelai!

27:54.089 --> 27:55.591
What?

27:54.089 --> 27:55.591
I was serious about that one.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.510
That's it.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.510
No more talk until dessert.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.890
- Come on! One more stop!

28:01.847 --> 28:03.890
- I can't.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.267
But tomorrow

28:03.932 --> 28:05.267
you'll fly away to London

28:05.309 --> 28:06.852
and we will

28:05.309 --> 28:06.852
forget all about you.

28:06.893 --> 28:08.604
I'm touched, but Rory

28:06.893 --> 28:08.604
will be back in a minute.

28:08.646 --> 28:09.855
You know, I'm starting

28:08.646 --> 28:09.855
to get the feeling

28:09.896 --> 28:10.897
you'd rather be

28:09.896 --> 28:10.897
with her than with us.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.358
Impossible.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.026
I appreciate

28:12.399 --> 28:14.026
the drinks and the diversion.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.277
Your friendship over

28:14.067 --> 28:15.277
the years is worth at least

28:15.319 --> 28:16.445
a couple pages in my memoir.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.197
But as of now, it's goodbye.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.408
I'm spending the rest

28:18.238 --> 28:21.408
of the night alone with my girl.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.035
[British accent]

28:21.450 --> 28:23.035
Hello, governor. Chips?

28:23.076 --> 28:24.870
I'm sorry.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.870
I was looking for my girlfriend.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.997
Oh, I'm sorry, mate.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.997
No girlfriends here.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.290
Just us birds and blokes

28:28.332 --> 28:29.833
taking the piss

28:28.332 --> 28:29.833
out of each other.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.502
Your accent

28:29.875 --> 28:31.502
is terrible, by the way.

28:31.544 --> 28:32.919
Just go with it, you geezer.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.588
Now, we have heard that

28:34.630 --> 28:36.756
you're about to fly away

28:34.630 --> 28:36.756
to Old Blighty, and word

28:36.798 --> 28:39.759
'round the pub has it you're

28:36.798 --> 28:39.759
not terribly happy about it.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.304
Well, I'm leaving a couple

28:39.801 --> 28:42.304
people I'm pretty fond of.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.224
And some people I'm a little

28:42.346 --> 28:45.224
afraid of, but all in all..

28:45.265 --> 28:46.892
Well, we're just going

28:45.265 --> 28:46.892
to have to change your mind

28:46.933 --> 28:48.435
because London, you see

28:48.477 --> 28:51.104
is a place of fun

28:48.477 --> 28:51.104
and musical excitement

28:51.146 --> 28:53.148
the Queen,

28:51.146 --> 28:53.148
"Hello Magazine".

28:53.190 --> 28:55.150
You're gonna break into a chorus

28:53.190 --> 28:55.150
of "Chim Chimney" any minute.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.277
- Aren't you?

28:55.192 --> 28:57.277
- Shush, now. None of that talk.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.655
Because tomorrow,

28:57.319 --> 28:59.655
brilliant things will happen.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.407
A new life,

28:59.697 --> 29:01.407
a new adventure.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.242
You like adventure,

29:01.448 --> 29:03.242
don't you, mate?

29:03.283 --> 29:05.077
Well, London is certainly

29:03.283 --> 29:05.077
the place for that

29:05.118 --> 29:08.497
and we, frankly, would not be

29:05.118 --> 29:08.497
the fine chaps we claim to be

29:08.539 --> 29:10.666
if we did not send

29:08.539 --> 29:10.666
you off in a proper way.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.710
With the bash

29:10.708 --> 29:12.710
of a lifetime!

29:12.751 --> 29:14.169
[all cheering]

29:14.211 --> 29:16.255
Come on.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.255
Someone get this chap a pint.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.923
You see, if you can't be happy.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.717
- At least you can be drunk.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.717
- Kiss me, Mary Poppins.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.009
I thought it was

29:19.758 --> 29:21.009
more Gwyneth Paltrow.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.219
- "Shakespeare In Love".

29:21.051 --> 29:22.219
- Kiss me.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.721
(male #1)

29:22.261 --> 29:23.721
'To the queen!'

29:23.762 --> 29:25.681
- To the queen!

29:28.892 --> 29:30.394
Well, that was

29:28.892 --> 29:30.394
a complete waste of time.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.604
What are you

29:30.436 --> 29:31.604
talking about?

29:31.645 --> 29:32.854
I'm talking

29:31.645 --> 29:32.854
about Christopher

29:32.896 --> 29:34.106
and Carolyn

29:32.896 --> 29:34.106
leaving separately.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.316
Well, come on, mom.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.316
What did you think?

29:36.358 --> 29:37.610
They were

29:36.358 --> 29:37.610
gonna throw down

29:37.651 --> 29:39.111
and consummate it

29:37.651 --> 29:39.111
right here in the foyer?

29:39.152 --> 29:40.779
No, I didn't think

29:39.152 --> 29:40.779
they were gonna throw down

29:40.820 --> 29:42.406
and consummate it

29:40.820 --> 29:42.406
in the foyer.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.907
I just thought they

29:42.448 --> 29:43.907
could go out for some coffee.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.284
- You served them coffee.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.284
- So what?

29:45.325 --> 29:46.535
So, you can't be shocked

29:45.325 --> 29:46.535
when you serve people

29:46.577 --> 29:47.869
three cups of coffee

29:46.577 --> 29:47.869
and they don't feel

29:47.911 --> 29:49.663
like going out

29:47.911 --> 29:49.663
for coffee. Not everyone's me.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.790
I just thought they would have

29:49.705 --> 29:51.790
hit it off better than that.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.125
You never know

29:51.831 --> 29:53.125
with these things.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.793
I was just so sure.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.170
- Oh, well. Maybe next time.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.170
- Absolutely.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.423
Christopher's probably

29:57.212 --> 29:59.423
too immature for Lynnie, anyway.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.466
I'm sure he is.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.883
The way he was going on and on

30:01.925 --> 30:03.719
about that motorcycle of his.

30:03.761 --> 30:05.345
I half expected him

30:03.761 --> 30:05.345
to start talking about

30:05.387 --> 30:06.888
his Tonka truck

30:05.387 --> 30:06.888
and announcing to the room

30:06.930 --> 30:09.349
he wanted to be

30:06.930 --> 30:09.349
a fireman or a cowboy someday.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.184
Sure is nice

30:09.391 --> 30:11.184
when it's not me.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.771
Alright, bye, mom.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.771
Have a nice trip.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.522
Goodbye, Lorelai.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.153
Gerta, did I fire you?

30:21.194 --> 30:22.738
(Gerta)

30:21.194 --> 30:22.738
'No.'

30:22.780 --> 30:23.822
Really?

30:23.863 --> 30:25.949
Everything's off tonight.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.660
(Lynnie)

30:25.991 --> 30:27.660
'You also know

30:25.991 --> 30:27.660
that it is one meal'

30:27.701 --> 30:29.703
'and one meal does not

30:27.701 --> 30:29.703
a lifestyle make.'

30:29.745 --> 30:32.122
That's okay, Sandra.

30:29.745 --> 30:32.122
Alright.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.583
Okay. Call anytime.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.583
I'll talk to you on Monday.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.001
Sorry.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.001
I'm blocking you in.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.336
No, no, that's okay.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.254
So, you do sessions

30:37.377 --> 30:39.254
over the phone?

30:39.296 --> 30:41.089
I do sessions

30:39.296 --> 30:41.089
whenever people need them.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.924
Wow. That's quite a commitment.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.551
Well, I've always

30:42.966 --> 30:44.551
been a good listener.

30:44.593 --> 30:47.846
Excellent note-taker.

30:44.593 --> 30:47.846
I have fantastic penmanship.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.683
- Good head-nodding abilities.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.683
- You found your calling.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.018
[chuckling]

30:50.724 --> 30:53.018
I think I did.

30:53.059 --> 30:55.437
- So, it was nice meeting you.

30:53.059 --> 30:55.437
- Oh, you too. You too.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.731
This was, this was really

30:55.479 --> 30:57.731
very, very sweet of your mom.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.817
- Well, you keep thinking that.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.817
- Hey.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.900
It's been a long time

30:59.858 --> 31:00.900
since I've been invited

31:00.942 --> 31:02.778
to such a blatant setup.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.862
It made me miss my own mom.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.280
[cellphone ringing]

31:03.903 --> 31:05.280
Oh.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.740
I'll just

31:05.322 --> 31:06.740
let it go to voice mail.

31:06.782 --> 31:09.034
Boy, your work sure

31:06.782 --> 31:09.034
follows you around, huh?

31:09.075 --> 31:10.410
When you're going

31:09.075 --> 31:10.410
through something

31:10.452 --> 31:12.120
you never know

31:10.452 --> 31:12.120
when you're gonna need to talk.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.497
Sometimes

31:12.162 --> 31:13.497
it sneaks up on you.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.333
Yeah, I suppose so.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.503
- You okay?

31:16.375 --> 31:19.503
- Me? Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.796
It was really nice meeting you.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.631
Sorry if I talked

31:20.838 --> 31:22.631
too much during dinner.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.299
Every now and then,

31:22.673 --> 31:24.299
I just feel the need

31:24.341 --> 31:27.135
to re-enact certain

31:24.341 --> 31:27.135
key scenes from "Purple Rain"

31:27.177 --> 31:29.095
you know,

31:27.177 --> 31:29.095
for a captive audience.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.097
The Lake Minnetonka scene

31:29.137 --> 31:31.097
really bugs my mom, so..

31:31.139 --> 31:32.850
I could analyze that one

31:31.139 --> 31:32.850
for you if you want.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.685
That one,

31:32.891 --> 31:34.685
I've got a handle on.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.354
Other things are more fuzzy,

31:34.727 --> 31:37.354
but that one, that one I got.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.856
Okay.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.652
- Lorelai?

31:42.275 --> 31:43.652
- Yeah?

31:43.694 --> 31:45.612
Do you..

31:45.654 --> 31:46.822
Do you want

31:45.654 --> 31:46.822
to talk about something?

31:46.864 --> 31:49.658
Me? No, no, I'm good.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.160
It was nice meeting you.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.160
Bye. I got to go.

31:52.202 --> 31:55.706
My parents have

31:52.202 --> 31:55.706
been married for 40 years

31:55.748 --> 31:58.291
and that's, like,

31:55.748 --> 31:58.291
mind-blowing for me

31:58.333 --> 32:01.169
because there is no one worse

31:58.333 --> 32:01.169
at communication than my mother

32:01.211 --> 32:03.714
except my father

32:01.211 --> 32:03.714
and most of my relatives.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.174
It is not

32:03.756 --> 32:06.174
a chatty group, basically.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.885
Everything in

32:06.216 --> 32:07.885
the Gilmore house was..

32:07.926 --> 32:09.845
"Don't talk about it.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.845
Shove it aside."

32:09.887 --> 32:11.430
And of course,

32:09.887 --> 32:11.430
I talked about it and shoved it

32:11.471 --> 32:13.223
right in your face,

32:11.471 --> 32:13.223
but still, I don't know.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.475
I never saw myself

32:13.265 --> 32:15.475
getting married.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.353
- Never?

32:15.517 --> 32:18.353
- Not until Max asked me..

32:18.395 --> 32:20.564
I, I think.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.775
I mean, I guess I thought

32:20.606 --> 32:22.775
about marrying Christopher

32:22.816 --> 32:24.777
when everyone was freaking out

32:22.816 --> 32:24.777
because I was pregnant

32:24.818 --> 32:28.447
but I never thought about it

32:24.818 --> 32:28.447
in a longingly, good way.

32:28.488 --> 32:29.531
That could be why.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.450
- Why?

32:29.573 --> 32:31.450
- Well, marriage..

32:31.491 --> 32:33.869
...was just

32:31.491 --> 32:33.869
a solution to a problem

32:33.911 --> 32:36.830
not anything romantic

32:33.911 --> 32:36.830
or because you were in love.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.874
Plus it came

32:36.872 --> 32:38.874
from your parents.

32:38.916 --> 32:40.292
I love that

32:38.916 --> 32:40.292
I've got one more thing

32:40.333 --> 32:41.710
to blame my mother for.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.003
What about Max?

32:41.752 --> 32:44.003
Did you love him?

32:44.045 --> 32:46.882
No, I didn't.

32:46.924 --> 32:50.343
I wanted to, but...I didn't.

32:50.385 --> 32:53.305
I don't think I ever

32:50.385 --> 32:53.305
really loved anyone until Luke.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.016
Did I tell you I proposed?

32:57.058 --> 33:00.479
- No. You didn't.

32:57.058 --> 33:00.479
- I did.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.775
I saw this guy in front

33:00.520 --> 33:04.775
of me who was a real...man.

33:04.817 --> 33:08.194
He was solid,

33:04.817 --> 33:08.194
and he was strong.

33:08.236 --> 33:11.824
He would protect me,

33:08.236 --> 33:11.824
but he, he got me.

33:11.865 --> 33:14.534
I knew all that

33:11.865 --> 33:14.534
when we started dating.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.369
But that moment,

33:14.576 --> 33:16.369
when I realized

33:16.411 --> 33:19.665
how much he cared

33:16.411 --> 33:19.665
for Rory...that was it.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.334
Suddenly, I knew I was ready.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.377
- Did he accept right away?

33:22.375 --> 33:24.377
- Pretty much.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.925
Hey, where's the weirdest place

33:26.713 --> 33:29.925
you ever had a session?

33:29.967 --> 33:31.426
Skull mountain

33:29.967 --> 33:31.426
at six flags.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.970
- Hmm, so, not this.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.970
- Nope, not this.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.013
Well, not only have

33:33.011 --> 33:35.013
I screwed up your night

33:35.054 --> 33:36.264
but it's not even

33:35.054 --> 33:36.264
a good story.

33:36.306 --> 33:37.808
It's still

33:36.306 --> 33:37.808
a pretty good story.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.518
Yeah, that's good,

33:37.850 --> 33:39.518
'cause I like to entertain.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.894
You know, I should have been a..

33:40.936 --> 33:42.521
A monkey in

33:40.936 --> 33:42.521
Washington Square Park

33:42.562 --> 33:45.064
with, like, a snappy hat.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.733
I feel so stupid.

33:46.775 --> 33:50.278
I really had myself

33:46.775 --> 33:50.278
believing it was gonna happen.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.947
I bought that

33:50.320 --> 33:51.947
stupid dress, and..

33:51.989 --> 33:54.407
...now it's just

33:51.989 --> 33:54.407
hanging there, mocking me.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.202
And the crazy thing is,

33:54.449 --> 33:57.202
I am ready to get married.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.788
I am ready to start

33:57.243 --> 33:59.788
the next phase of my life.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.665
I want another kid, and I..

34:01.707 --> 34:03.291
I don't want to wait anymore.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.793
I don't want to be patient.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.252
I've been patient long enough.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.589
I'm not happy,

34:06.294 --> 34:09.589
and I feel crappy all the time.

34:09.631 --> 34:11.925
And I just

34:09.631 --> 34:11.925
think I've had it.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.427
So..

34:14.469 --> 34:17.014
What are you gonna do?

34:17.055 --> 34:19.057
(Carolyn)

34:17.055 --> 34:19.057
'Only you can make you wait.'

34:19.098 --> 34:20.308
'Nobody else can.'

34:20.350 --> 34:21.977
You need to decide

34:20.350 --> 34:21.977
what you want

34:22.019 --> 34:24.437
and what you're willing

34:22.019 --> 34:24.437
to give up to get it

34:24.479 --> 34:27.148
and then you got

34:24.479 --> 34:27.148
to be okay with that

34:27.190 --> 34:29.234
or you got to

34:27.190 --> 34:29.234
be okay with waiting.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.069
I could lose him

34:29.275 --> 34:31.069
if I push too hard.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.072
You don't really

34:31.110 --> 34:34.072
seem to have him now.

34:34.113 --> 34:36.742
At least not the way

34:34.113 --> 34:36.742
you<i> want</i> to have him.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.203
'You won't get anything

34:36.783 --> 34:40.203
unless you ask for it.'

34:40.245 --> 34:41.788
And if you ask for it

34:40.245 --> 34:41.788
and you don't get it

34:41.830 --> 34:44.290
maybe it wasn't worth

34:41.830 --> 34:44.290
having in the first place.

34:45.709 --> 34:48.378
Some things are

34:45.709 --> 34:48.378
just never meant to be.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.463
No matter how much

34:48.420 --> 34:50.463
we wish they were.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.761
I can only imagine what

34:53.216 --> 34:55.761
you could do if you had a couch.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.641
Want to put money

34:59.639 --> 35:01.641
on who nails the queen?

35:01.683 --> 35:03.852
I think Her Highness

35:01.683 --> 35:03.852
is pretty safe tonight.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.812
Why? I thought

35:03.894 --> 35:05.812
Jenny and Paul broke up.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.064
They got back

35:05.854 --> 35:07.064
together this morning.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.314
- Do the boys know?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.314
- No.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.067
- Are you gonna tell them?

35:08.356 --> 35:10.067
- No.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.110
Well, watching your best friends

35:12.151 --> 35:13.737
waste precious

35:12.151 --> 35:13.737
scoring moments.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.280
You can get kicked out

35:13.779 --> 35:15.280
of the club for that.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.032
Yeah, well..

35:17.074 --> 35:20.326
You know, I have given a lot

35:17.074 --> 35:20.326
of great parties in my lifetime.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.120
- Oh, I know.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.120
- But..

35:22.161 --> 35:24.497
I do believe that

35:22.161 --> 35:24.497
this one has topped them all.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.458
Hey, it's not over.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.458
We have hours to go.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.709
There's plenty

35:26.499 --> 35:27.709
of beer left and..

35:27.751 --> 35:29.586
No one's

35:27.751 --> 35:29.586
slugged Finn yet, so..

35:29.628 --> 35:30.921
Thank you.

35:30.963 --> 35:33.298
My pleasure.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.717
- You want more beer?

35:33.339 --> 35:35.717
- No.

35:35.759 --> 35:38.011
More Twiglets, Cadburys?

35:38.053 --> 35:39.763
I'm good.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.808
Do you wanna try the frug again?

35:39.805 --> 35:42.808
I think my cramp has gone away.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.852
Tell me not to go.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.228
What?

35:47.270 --> 35:48.647
Tell me not to

35:47.270 --> 35:48.647
get on that plane.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.398
Tell me to blow

35:48.688 --> 35:50.398
off my father, the paper

35:50.440 --> 35:51.900
the whole

35:50.440 --> 35:51.900
Huntzberger destiny.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.610
Just tell me I can

35:51.942 --> 35:53.610
figure something else out.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.736
Just tell me not to go.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.865
Well, I can't do that.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.623
Hey, you afraid the teacher's

36:04.079 --> 36:06.623
gonna see or something?

36:09.793 --> 36:14.213
♪ Don't stand

36:09.793 --> 36:14.213
in the pouring rain ♪

36:14.255 --> 36:17.300
No, I can't just charge you

36:14.255 --> 36:17.300
for half a cup of coffee.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.636
But I'm not gonna

36:17.342 --> 36:19.636
drink the whole cup.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.805
Seems like a gyp.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.306
Hey. I need to talk to you.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.058
- Where have you been?

36:23.348 --> 36:25.058
- It doesn't matter.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.434
What're you talking about?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.434
"It doesn't matter"?

36:26.476 --> 36:27.769
I've been looking

36:26.476 --> 36:27.769
everywhere for you.

36:27.811 --> 36:28.895
I tried your cell.

36:27.811 --> 36:28.895
I went by the inn.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.396
Patty was at your house.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.440
- Let's elope.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.440
- What?

36:32.482 --> 36:34.109
Come on, Luke.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.109
Grab your keys.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.902
- Let's go.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.902
- Elope?

36:35.944 --> 36:37.654
You said that would

36:35.944 --> 36:37.654
be fine at Martha's vineyard.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.739
Didn't you say that would

36:37.696 --> 36:39.739
be fine at Martha's vineyard?

36:39.781 --> 36:42.659
- Yes, I did. But, I'm just--

36:39.781 --> 36:42.659
- Come on, then! Let's go!

36:42.701 --> 36:44.828
We can drive to Maryland.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.828
What the hell, right?

36:44.870 --> 36:46.705
I mean, you have

36:44.870 --> 36:46.705
to see Maryland eventually.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.581
We can drive there,

36:46.746 --> 36:48.581
and get married

36:48.623 --> 36:50.416
and then come back here.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.585
And you'll get your stuff,

36:50.458 --> 36:52.585
and you'll move in.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.837
- Okay, hold on.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.837
- I mean..

36:53.879 --> 36:55.296
We have

36:53.879 --> 36:55.296
the plan already, right?

36:55.338 --> 36:57.090
We just have

36:55.338 --> 36:57.090
to put the plan in motion.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.591
Yeah, let's

36:57.132 --> 36:58.591
calm down, we don't have

36:58.633 --> 37:00.052
to figure

36:58.633 --> 37:00.052
all this out now, do we?

37:00.093 --> 37:02.179
Yes, we do, because

37:00.093 --> 37:02.179
we've been waiting and waiting

37:02.220 --> 37:04.472
and putting it off, and I don't

37:02.220 --> 37:04.472
want to put it off anymore.

37:04.514 --> 37:07.142
- Yeah, but right now?

37:04.514 --> 37:07.142
- Yes, now is the right time.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.977
It's the best time

37:07.184 --> 37:08.977
because it's now.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.520
- Come on.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.520
- Your car or mine?

37:10.562 --> 37:12.064
Lorelai, let's just

37:10.562 --> 37:12.064
talk this through.

37:12.105 --> 37:13.190
No, I don't wanna talk.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.315
All we've

37:13.231 --> 37:14.315
done for months is talk.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.775
I want to do.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.775
I want to go.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.360
We can't just take off

37:15.817 --> 37:17.360
and get married.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.278
Why not, Luke?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.278
Don't you love me?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.364
- You know I do.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.364
- But I love you, Luke.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.158
I love you,

37:21.406 --> 37:23.158
but I have waited

37:23.200 --> 37:24.951
and I have stayed away,

37:23.200 --> 37:24.951
and I have let you

37:24.993 --> 37:26.536
run this thing, and no more.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.663
I asked you to marry me,

37:26.578 --> 37:28.663
and you said yes.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.498
Yeah, I'm just

37:28.705 --> 37:30.498
trying to think here.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.167
We, we fixed up

37:30.540 --> 37:32.167
the house, right?

37:32.209 --> 37:33.793
We have

37:32.209 --> 37:33.793
a bigger closet, and..

37:33.835 --> 37:35.879
I didn't get

37:33.835 --> 37:35.879
the purple wallpaper

37:35.921 --> 37:37.672
because you didn't want

37:35.921 --> 37:37.672
the purple wallpaper.

37:37.714 --> 37:40.717
And if it's between you

37:37.714 --> 37:40.717
and the purple wallpaper

37:40.759 --> 37:42.635
I pick you!

37:40.759 --> 37:42.635
I pick you.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.054
I didn't tell you

37:42.677 --> 37:44.054
not to get the purple wallpaper.

37:44.096 --> 37:45.638
Oh, my God.

37:44.096 --> 37:45.638
You didn't like it.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.932
I don't care

37:45.680 --> 37:46.932
about wallpaper!

37:46.973 --> 37:48.516
- Do you care about me?

37:46.973 --> 37:48.516
- Yes!

37:48.558 --> 37:50.309
Because I'm

37:48.558 --> 37:50.309
going crazy here.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.520
I made a commitment to you,

37:50.351 --> 37:52.520
and I need to make it happen.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.232
It will. It will happen, okay?

37:52.562 --> 37:55.232
I just have April to consider.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.858
But once we're married

37:56.900 --> 37:58.484
everything

37:56.900 --> 37:58.484
with April will be fine.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.361
- Anna said so.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.361
- "Anna said so"?

38:00.403 --> 38:02.197
- What does that mean?

38:00.403 --> 38:02.197
- When I talked to Anna--

38:02.239 --> 38:04.365
- When did you talk to Anna?

38:02.239 --> 38:04.365
- After the party--

38:04.407 --> 38:05.742
I didn't know

38:04.407 --> 38:05.742
you talked to Anna.

38:05.784 --> 38:06.826
You weren't

38:05.784 --> 38:06.826
supposed to talk to Anna.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.703
I know. I'm sor..

38:06.868 --> 38:08.703
God, no!

38:08.745 --> 38:10.163
I'm not gonna defend myself!

38:10.205 --> 38:11.706
For months now,

38:10.205 --> 38:11.706
I've been skulking around

38:11.748 --> 38:13.625
not saying anything, not having

38:11.748 --> 38:13.625
an opinion on anything

38:13.666 --> 38:15.252
like I'm Clarence Thomas

38:13.666 --> 38:15.252
or something
