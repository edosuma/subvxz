WEBVTT

00:16.250 --> 00:18.083
Oh God.

00:18.166 --> 00:21.958
I can't believe I hooked up
with a caterer at my mom's wedding.

00:22.041 --> 00:24.166
No, Reagan, you have worked hard.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.500
You have earned a fling
with a random dude.

00:31.708 --> 00:33.291
Wait a second.

00:33.791 --> 00:36.458
The name
is Masters, Rafe Masters.

00:36.541 --> 00:39.000
Why are you saying
your name backwards, weirdo?

00:39.083 --> 00:40.333
This guy's a weirdo.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.416
Two martinis, shaken, not stir--

00:42.500 --> 00:45.458
Fuck that!
Let's do some fucking shots, bitch!

00:48.208 --> 00:49.958
-Reagan! Reagan!

00:52.583 --> 00:54.958
This one goes out
to all the lovers in the crowd.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.041
Oh no.

01:02.125 --> 01:02.958
Mmm.

01:03.041 --> 01:06.916
You may have apprehended those pirates,
but I got the booty.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.250
-Blech.
-I'll make us an English breakfast.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.458
How do you take your beans?

01:10.541 --> 01:13.375
Yeah, my day is, uh, kind of packed.

01:13.458 --> 01:16.250
I've gotta topple
some dictators after this.

01:16.333 --> 01:17.166
Oh shit!

01:17.250 --> 01:20.875
Funny, I don't remember
ordering a wake-up call.

01:34.416 --> 01:36.083
Ugh. Smooth move, Reagan.

01:36.166 --> 01:39.125
Try to have a normal, boring fling
and end up with a secret agent.

01:44.791 --> 01:47.000
Well, this attack was over easy.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.500
Wait a second. You're walking out on me?

01:51.583 --> 01:53.750
Masters, Rafe Masters?

01:53.833 --> 01:57.500
Yeah,
this guy's a fucking legend.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.458
Super nice meeting you.

01:59.541 --> 02:01.875
We should totally do this again sometime.

02:01.958 --> 02:04.833
How about an unspecified time
that never comes up?

02:04.916 --> 02:05.958
Okay, bye!

02:10.750 --> 02:12.166
Oh, my other shoe.

02:13.041 --> 02:14.000
Taxi.

02:38.208 --> 02:40.500
Hey, Reagan.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.833
-Hey, girl. There she is.

02:42.916 --> 02:45.250
You were
fucking hilarious last night.

02:45.333 --> 02:49.125
I hereby bestow my title
of office wildcard to you, Reagan.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.125
-So, how was it?
-How was what?

02:51.208 --> 02:52.416
Oh, come on.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.791
We saw you making out…

02:53.875 --> 02:56.875
…with the Masters, Rafe Masters.

02:56.958 --> 02:58.416
Please stop saying it like that.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.666
We need to know everything.
What's his pube situation?

03:01.750 --> 03:03.583
Do his condoms
look like little tuxedos?

03:03.666 --> 03:07.500
What happens in the bedroom
is nobody's business except Congress.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.875
But in this case, I'll allow it.
Dish, girl.

03:09.958 --> 03:11.541
Guys, there's not much to tell.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.458
Forgettable sex,
only five or six casualties, a fling.

03:15.541 --> 03:18.375
Ugh, I've always wanted to be a superspy.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.666
I used to watch all the James Bond movies.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.333
I even had a secret identity.

03:22.416 --> 03:25.750
In public, my parents would tell people
I was someone else's kid.

03:26.583 --> 03:27.666
Yeesh.

03:27.750 --> 03:31.250
Brett's repressed trauma aside,
it was just a one-night thing.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.333
I… I'll probably never even see
the guy again.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.000
Well, hello, all.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.291
Holy shit.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.875
Team, I'm not sure
if you remember Agent Masters,

03:40.958 --> 03:43.541
but seeing as he really saved our bums

03:43.625 --> 03:46.333
during that whole
flat-Earth pirate situation…

03:46.416 --> 03:47.250
That was me.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.708
I made an explosive
out of an Amazon Alexa.

03:49.791 --> 03:52.708
…we're going to be helping him out
with an MI6 mission,

03:52.791 --> 03:55.416
stopping his evil nemesis,
Dr. SkullFinger,

03:55.500 --> 03:57.750
who, by the way,
currently resides in a gorgeous

03:57.833 --> 04:02.333
seven-bedroom, eight-bathroom lair
with 360 ocean views…

04:02.416 --> 04:03.291
Scoundrel.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.958
…from unleashing
a powerful mind-control device

04:06.041 --> 04:06.875
on the populace.

04:06.958 --> 04:09.375
But we use mind control all the time.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.666
Like our memory erasers.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.583
Just this week, I used one on myself

04:12.666 --> 04:15.333
to forget the ending of Breaking Bad
so I could rewatch it.

04:15.416 --> 04:17.375
Walt dies, Jesse lives, big deal.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.500
Goddamn it.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.833
But SkullFinger's device
is far more powerful.

04:21.916 --> 04:24.333
This thing can wipe your whole mind clean.

04:24.416 --> 04:28.416
It's way more evil.
So we have to eliminate the competition.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.625
Reagan, I want you
designing Rafe's gadgets

04:30.708 --> 04:32.750
and running point
from the surveillance boat.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.000
-Mmm.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.458
Hey, let me know if you need
a bitchin' Spotify playlist.

04:36.541 --> 04:39.458
Oh my God, a Spot-i-spy playlist.

04:39.541 --> 04:40.458
Oh, oh!

04:40.541 --> 04:42.833
I'll make the puns around here, thank you.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.166
Please like me.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.000
Rafe,
so glad to be working with you.

04:47.083 --> 04:51.000
Yes, I can't wait to bond, Team Bond.

04:52.958 --> 04:55.458
-Hey, laughing is great.

04:55.541 --> 04:58.083
Shit. Shit. Shit. I cannot believe this.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.000
I can't work with someone
I've hooked up with.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.958
Can't you just tell him
you're not interested?

05:02.041 --> 05:03.666
You're usually Miss Brutal Honesty.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.916
Remember when you made Glenn cry
at his own birthday?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.833
I was dancing too confidently,
and I needed to hear it.

05:08.916 --> 05:10.666
It's different with relationships.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.083
Everybody I've ever broken up with

05:12.166 --> 05:15.416
makes me feel like the bad guy
just for being direct.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.583
Took the liberty of grabbing
an extra pudding cup for my pudding.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.666
You're boring!
You're fucking boring, Steve.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.875
And the only thing
keeping us together is inertia,

05:23.958 --> 05:28.791
and I feel more attachment
to this disposable fork than I do to you!

05:28.875 --> 05:31.791
-You monster.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.666
Boo.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.250
From now on, my new strategy
is to avoid hurt feelings,

05:38.333 --> 05:41.583
send zero signals,
and just hope the guy gets the message.

05:43.750 --> 05:44.750
-Rafe?

05:44.833 --> 05:47.500
I guess I couldn't bear to leave.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.083
What the hell? Did you…

05:49.166 --> 05:51.041
-Did you bring that from home?
-What do you mean?

05:51.125 --> 05:54.208
You literally dragged
an entire bearskin rug in here.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.666
-Yes.
-Just so you could make that pun?

05:56.750 --> 05:58.000
-Yes.
-You got that rug--

05:58.083 --> 05:59.250
-Right.
-Put it in your car--

05:59.333 --> 06:00.375
Drove over here, correct.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.458
So you could say,
"I couldn't bear to leave."

06:02.541 --> 06:03.500
Bear to leave, right.

06:03.583 --> 06:06.583
I'm confused. I… is sex happening?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.208
To the left.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.583
Now a little… a little to the right.

06:17.125 --> 06:19.833
Okay. Now make your entrance
as quietly as possible.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.000
Nice of me to drop in.

06:25.083 --> 06:26.291
-Rafe, what the fuck?

06:26.375 --> 06:28.583
You're supposed to be a secret agent.

06:28.666 --> 06:30.541
And why are you wearing a tuxedo?

06:30.625 --> 06:32.875
This is a covert mission.
It's not the Emmys.

06:32.958 --> 06:36.791
Sorry, love. Loudly is
the only way I know how to enter.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.333
-Come on, man.
-Awesome.

06:38.416 --> 06:41.083
Can we just keep things
professional, please?

06:41.166 --> 06:42.583
Twelve bogeys approaching.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.375
-Initiate shoe-merang.
-Shoe-merang?

06:46.458 --> 06:49.375
It was kind of a name came first,
idea came second kind of thing.

06:49.458 --> 06:52.791
Sorry, gentlemen,
just need to tie these laces.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.750
May God rest your soles.

06:59.833 --> 07:00.791
-Yes!

07:01.375 --> 07:04.208
This man is the Michael Jordan
of casual murder.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.375
Okay, Rafe,
now you just need to find the machine.

07:06.458 --> 07:12.416
Well, if it isn't the constant thorn
in my side, Rafe Masters.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.166
Dr. SkullFinger.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.666
Seems I've managed
to penetrate your defenses.

07:17.750 --> 07:21.583
I assure you, that's the last thing
you'll be penetrating.

07:21.666 --> 07:25.166
Are you sensing kind of a… vibe
between these two?

07:25.250 --> 07:28.166
Ugh. I don't know.
Everything this guy says is horny.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.708
Behold Project Gaslight.

07:35.666 --> 07:36.916
Looks like a dick.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.208
-Beat you to it.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.166
Ever since I fell in that vat of skulls
and became wickedly twisted,

07:42.250 --> 07:43.750
I dreamed of this day.

07:43.833 --> 07:46.208
Rafe, it's time. Release the nanobots.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.833
SkullFinger, prepare to receive my load.

07:49.916 --> 07:51.166
Okay, yeah, I do hear it.

07:53.166 --> 07:56.916
What? No, my beautiful machine!

07:57.500 --> 08:01.041
Where on earth did you acquire
such advanced technology?

08:01.125 --> 08:03.125
From my new girlfriend.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.833
-Whoa, we did not discuss that.

08:05.916 --> 08:07.916
Damn you, Masters.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.208
I couldn't have done this
without your wonderful gadgets, Reagan,

08:11.291 --> 08:13.541
and now that
we've gotten rid of the skull,

08:13.625 --> 08:15.416
it's time to finger.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.750
Okay, fuck it,
I gotta break things off with this guy.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.875
Rafe, okay, we need to talk.
The boat was fun.

08:22.958 --> 08:25.083
Especially the sex part.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.750
Uh-huh. The thing is, that night,

08:27.833 --> 08:30.583
I was just trying to get
something out of my system.

08:30.666 --> 08:33.458
What I'm trying to say
is this has run its course.

08:33.541 --> 08:36.375
Wait a second,
are you breaking up with me?

08:36.458 --> 08:38.750
How could you treat me like this

08:38.833 --> 08:41.625
after leading me on
with all those gadgets?

08:42.625 --> 08:44.416
Is she abusing that man?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.125
What a heartless woman.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.041
-Misandry strikes again.
-Why?

08:48.125 --> 08:49.500
-Why?!
-What?

08:49.583 --> 08:51.750
No.
I'm not breaking up with you.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.583
Phew. Okay.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.916
Because I have some very exciting news.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.666
I've actually been checking out
houses in DC

08:59.750 --> 09:01.875
so I could move here indefinitely.

09:01.958 --> 09:02.791
What?!

09:03.750 --> 09:05.625
This is totally fine.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.083
So let me get this straight.

09:08.166 --> 09:10.416
You finally get laid
by the first guy this year

09:10.500 --> 09:12.416
who doesn't run on a charger,

09:12.500 --> 09:14.458
and you want to ditch him?

09:14.541 --> 09:16.875
The guy is totally smothering me.

09:16.958 --> 09:20.875
I just want Dr. No Fucking Clue
to Brexit my life

09:20.958 --> 09:23.000
without me having to feel guilty about it.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.333
I don't understand this at all.
You're so lucky.

09:25.416 --> 09:28.666
I'd do anything to spend more time
with Rafe. Has he mentioned me?

09:28.750 --> 09:31.000
Girl, if you wanna really get rid
of this dude,

09:31.083 --> 09:33.000
there's only one solution left.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.458
-Ghost Protocol.

09:35.541 --> 09:36.708
Ghost Protocol?

09:36.791 --> 09:40.041
You use Cognito's resources
to fake your own death

09:40.125 --> 09:42.291
then go off the grid until he moves on.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.250
Trust me,
this is how I've helped

09:44.333 --> 09:47.375
all the biggest dead celebrities
escape the spotlight.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.500
The world thinks
Tupac and Biggie are gone,

09:49.583 --> 09:51.333
but they're living their best lives

09:51.416 --> 09:53.250
in Upstate New York
with three Pomeranians.

09:53.333 --> 09:56.875
-Aw.
-We've all used the program for ourselves.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.333
I ghosted Ann Coulter.

09:58.416 --> 10:01.666
She made me role-play as a liberal
just so she could drink my tears.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.041
Uh, I used it too.

10:03.125 --> 10:06.291
I had to ghost my old Burning Man crew
at the Orgy Dome.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.208
What's the point of anonymous sex

10:08.291 --> 10:10.625
if you add each other
on Facebook afterwards?!

10:12.625 --> 10:15.250
He loved tripping on mushrooms,
but once he was high,

10:15.333 --> 10:18.208
he'd make me watch
these Jordan Peterson videos with him.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.166
I had to end it.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.375
So, what do you think?

10:20.458 --> 10:21.333
Hmm.

10:21.416 --> 10:24.791
Fake my death
to avoid getting texts from a man.

10:30.916 --> 10:31.750
Fuck it.

10:32.541 --> 10:33.791
Ghost Protocol me.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.208
Oh wow.

10:38.291 --> 10:39.125
What a kitchen.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.958
Is the stove gas or electric?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.708
Oh, it's magma-powered.

10:42.791 --> 10:43.750
Of course.

10:43.833 --> 10:48.125
Pots and pans, plots and plans.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.625
Oh, and is that a doggy door for henchmen?

10:50.708 --> 10:53.750
You're telling me SkullFinger
tore up the original hardwood?

10:53.833 --> 10:54.791
What a monster.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.458
The granite
is so elegant though, isn't it?

10:57.541 --> 11:00.166
Makes it so much easier
to clean up human remains.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.041
Well, I'm sold. Where do I sign?

11:02.125 --> 11:03.500
Just in blood, right here.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.500
I can drain the employee pension fund,

11:05.583 --> 11:06.958
buy this place for cheap,

11:07.041 --> 11:09.583
and start
a tasty little Airbnb side hustle.

11:10.583 --> 11:14.916
Jesus. I've been
in the evil real estate game for 15 years,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.083
but that man's a psycho.

11:20.541 --> 11:21.791
Rafe, over here.

11:21.875 --> 11:25.791
-Reagan.
-I can't wait to go on our second date.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.375
Oh no! What's that?

11:30.625 --> 11:32.083
Lock and load, Noel.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.166
Reagan!

11:46.416 --> 11:48.541
No!

11:54.500 --> 11:57.666
-I've been shot so much!

11:57.750 --> 12:01.416
No!

12:03.375 --> 12:04.416
Reagan!

12:04.500 --> 12:07.500
I loved her,
and she fell in garbage and exploded.

12:09.125 --> 12:12.500
Oh my goodness.
What a sudden, elaborate death.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.833
But what do I know?

12:13.916 --> 12:17.166
I'm just a very hot
and very single onlooker.

12:22.166 --> 12:23.833
Hell yeah, I'm dead!

12:23.916 --> 12:25.416
I've never felt more alive.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.958
Here, you've earned this.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.166
No!

12:31.250 --> 12:33.083
But maybe yes.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.541
Okay, the crisis actors are all in place.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.500
These are pre-written eulogies.
Please recite them verbatim.

12:42.583 --> 12:46.833
"Hi. I'm Andre. Gee, I hope
I don't roll this eulogy up and smoke it."

12:46.916 --> 12:48.583
Is this what you really think of me?

12:48.666 --> 12:51.083
I'm not just a drug guy, you know?
I speak Latin.

12:51.166 --> 12:52.208
-Yeah, sure.
-Uh-huh.

12:52.291 --> 12:54.458
Whatever, dude,
you love weed. We get it.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.166
"Reagan Ridley had a brilliant mind,

12:57.250 --> 12:59.708
but she also knew how to rock a bold lip."

13:01.125 --> 13:02.041
You wish.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.333
"Reagan was an American hero."

13:04.416 --> 13:07.250
"We didn't agree politically, but…"

13:08.083 --> 13:09.708
Hmm, just ends there.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.458
What can I say about Reagan

13:11.958 --> 13:14.958
that I haven't already written
on a bathroom stall at work?

13:15.916 --> 13:19.250
Why? Why?!

13:20.708 --> 13:24.458
Time to enjoy my death and catch up
on some Great British Bake Off.

13:26.791 --> 13:29.791
Hey, man, I know you're hurting.
Is there anything that could cheer you up?

13:29.875 --> 13:32.041
Driving a tank
through a bombed-out Soviet village?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.750
Choking someone out with a cumberbund?

13:33.833 --> 13:35.666
Oh, thank you. Brett, was it?

13:35.750 --> 13:38.375
But no, the only thing
that could bring me peace

13:38.458 --> 13:41.000
is finding Reagan's killer.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.541
-Right, her killer.

13:44.041 --> 13:47.208
Well, um, I, uh, guess it could be anyone.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.708
Do you wanna hear my confessions?

13:52.791 --> 13:55.500
-Oh come on.
-Ashes to ashes, motherfucker.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.791
You know, now that you mention it, Brett,
everyone here is acting a little strange.

13:59.875 --> 14:01.541
What? No, they're--
I didn't mean to imply--

14:01.625 --> 14:05.458
Yes, it's like
they don't even care Reagan's dead.

14:05.541 --> 14:06.916
Something's not right here.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.583
Probably best not to speculate.

14:08.666 --> 14:10.791
Brett, thanks specifically
to your observations,

14:10.875 --> 14:13.333
I'm starting to think
this may have been an inside job.

14:13.416 --> 14:14.250
Uh…

14:14.333 --> 14:15.458
Ha, I get it.

14:15.541 --> 14:20.416
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it,
but I'm gonna need a hand, an agent hand.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.000
-What do you say?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.875
You want me to help you?

14:23.958 --> 14:26.916
Oh my God, am I dreaming?
This is the best day of my life!

14:28.166 --> 14:30.083
So sorry for our loss.

14:30.166 --> 14:32.375
You just got ashed, sucker!

14:33.708 --> 14:38.125
And so that's the difference
between a macaroon and a macaron.

14:38.208 --> 14:39.125
It's crazy, right?

14:39.208 --> 14:41.166
Fascinating. You need to ante.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.666
Guys, being dead?
Best thing that's ever happened to me.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.041
I get to binge-watch TV.
I don't have to answer any texts.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.250
I blew off jury duty.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.041
I'm almost gonna be sad
when Rafe goes back to the UK.

14:50.125 --> 14:52.541
-Did you hear that?

14:56.416 --> 14:59.083
Where is the confounded valet?

14:59.166 --> 15:02.125
Oh my Go-- What is he doing here?
Who told him about poker night?

15:02.208 --> 15:03.125
-Uh-huh.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.000
-Damn it, Brett.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.541
Oh, wow, awesome. Ejector seat.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.625
Do any of these buttons dispense Advil?

15:11.708 --> 15:13.250
They're coming! You gotta hide me.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.000
I just disappear you.
It's on you to stay disappeared.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.291
Goddamn it,
can't even enjoy my death in peace.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.583
Hey, dudes.

15:20.666 --> 15:24.583
My new, uh, partner here
insisted on coming to poker night,

15:24.666 --> 15:27.583
and I couldn't think of
any believable reasons why he shouldn't.

15:27.666 --> 15:30.333
Mind if I enter your little game?

15:30.416 --> 15:36.083
I brought $100,000
in nonsequential, unmarked bills.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.291
Uh, it's a five-dollar buy-in.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.666
Welp, I am gonna grab a brewski

15:40.750 --> 15:43.125
and, uh, a seltzer for him.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.208
Shaken, not stirred.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.708
-You want me to shake the seltzer?
-I drink everything shaken!

15:46.791 --> 15:49.458
Now, let's play.

15:51.416 --> 15:53.208
What is he still doing in town?

15:53.291 --> 15:55.000
He says he wants to find your killer,

15:55.083 --> 15:58.375
and, uh, he maybe kind of sort of thinks
someone on the team is involved.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.666
-And why would he think that?
-I don't know.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.833
They were acting
pretty suspicious at the funeral.

16:02.916 --> 16:05.875
On the bright side,
I'm learning so much spy stuff.

16:05.958 --> 16:08.666
Rafe taught me
how to blow up a vault with a motorcycle.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.000
It involves more vodka than you'd think.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.875
-Hey, what are you doing?

16:17.458 --> 16:19.541
All right, I'm all in.

16:19.625 --> 16:20.875
-Dude.
-What the fuck?

16:20.958 --> 16:22.500
We said five bucks, man.

16:22.583 --> 16:23.583
I call.

16:24.791 --> 16:26.166
Interesting.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.583
Unlike everyone else here,
you have no tells,

16:29.666 --> 16:31.000
and in my line of work,

16:31.083 --> 16:33.791
those tend to be the people
with the most to hide.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.750
Tell me where Reagan's killer is!
What do you know?

16:36.833 --> 16:39.583
Damn, why am I always attracted to crazy?

16:39.666 --> 16:44.000
Not one more word,
or your little sidekick here gets it

16:44.083 --> 16:47.750
at the hands of the nefarious, uh,

16:47.833 --> 16:50.041
Strainer Face.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.541
Strainer Face?

16:51.625 --> 16:52.750
Yes, that checks out.

16:52.833 --> 16:56.083
Just as I suspected,
you were harboring Reagan's killer.

16:56.166 --> 16:59.333
You should just give up
and move on with your life.

16:59.416 --> 17:01.416
Maybe take a pottery class or something.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.625
I'll never give up.
Reagan wouldn't have wanted me to.

17:05.708 --> 17:08.583
How are you so wrong all the time?

17:08.666 --> 17:09.916
-Oh.
-Henchmen, roll out.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.333
Goddamn Strainer Face.

17:19.625 --> 17:20.791
They left me?

17:20.875 --> 17:22.916
I… I mean… I mean, escaped us.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.708
We'll track them down. I have my methods.

17:25.791 --> 17:28.250
But in the meantime,
if you're going to be a superspy,

17:28.333 --> 17:31.625
you need to be able to defend yourself
in situations like this.

17:31.708 --> 17:33.666
-I want to give you something.
-A gun?

17:33.750 --> 17:38.875
Even better. This is a special timepiece
that emits a cloud of knockout gas.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.083
It was the last spy gadget
Reagan ever made me.

17:42.166 --> 17:45.541
So you get a pistol,
and I get a little watch that farts?

17:45.625 --> 17:48.250
-Yes, that's basically it.
-Okay, okay, I'm into it.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.458
Yes, that's right.

17:49.541 --> 17:53.083
Divert the entire pension fund
into my personal account.

17:53.166 --> 17:56.041
It's not embezzling.
It's a surefire investment.

17:56.125 --> 17:57.375
I'm invezzling.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.791
I mean, this is America.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.125
This is barely illegal.

18:01.208 --> 18:02.708
-Fucking tight-ass.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.333
Alan, it's J.R.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.541
Have I got an opportunity for you.

18:07.625 --> 18:11.291
Are you still looking for an island
where you can hunt interns for sport?

18:11.375 --> 18:13.958
Better snap it up before Oprah does.

18:14.625 --> 18:18.041
Gigi, thanks for letting us crash
at Tupac and Biggie's old safe house.

18:18.125 --> 18:20.458
You can really tell
they weren't getting along at this point.

18:20.541 --> 18:23.250
Reagan, this is not a long-term solution.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.625
Look at us.
No one can agree what to watch on TV.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.833
Glenn has totally destroyed
our snack supply.

18:27.916 --> 18:29.583
What? I stress eat.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.208
Yeah, Reagan.
We're all hiding in a panic room

18:33.291 --> 18:34.916
from your psychopath boyfriend.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.291
It's time to call it. Pull the Band-Aid.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.958
Oh, really?
Would you tell Joe Rogan the truth?

18:41.041 --> 18:43.541
I mean, he would probably say
the truth is a spectrum,

18:43.625 --> 18:45.375
and I would tell him that makes no sense,

18:45.458 --> 18:47.875
and then he'd put me into a headlock,
get insanely high,

18:47.958 --> 18:51.416
and then jump into
a sensory deprivation tank, so no.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.541
And, Andre,
I assume you're gonna be telling

18:53.625 --> 18:56.166
that insane sex cult where to find you?

18:56.250 --> 18:57.666
Oh God, no.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.083
I really don't have
the emotional bandwidth

19:00.166 --> 19:01.833
for multiple sex cults right now.

19:01.916 --> 19:03.625
See? You're all hypocrites.

19:03.708 --> 19:07.333
We've all ghosted people,
and this is the craziest one of them all.

19:07.416 --> 19:10.291
I am telling you,
we just need to wait him out.

19:10.375 --> 19:14.541
In breaking news, supervillain SkullFinger
was captured at his island lair,

19:14.625 --> 19:15.583
which is on the market…

19:15.666 --> 19:18.500
Or find him a distraction.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.333
It's you. How'd you get in here?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.041
You'd be shocked what a combination

19:29.125 --> 19:32.208
of science and feminine wiles
can accomplish.

19:32.291 --> 19:35.666
AI mission assist
reports zero seductions.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.333
Okay, fine, it was all science.

19:37.416 --> 19:40.583
Look, I'm here to bust you out
so you can be Rafe's nemesis again.

19:40.666 --> 19:42.750
I've heard the way
you guys talk to each other.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.041
You are meant to be together.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.791
Oh, honey, no, thanks.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.291
I actually realized
that whole hero-nemesis thing

19:49.375 --> 19:51.000
was, like, super toxic.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.958
I mean, the guy was obsessed with me.

19:53.041 --> 19:54.375
-Honestly, he's--
-A bit much.

19:54.458 --> 19:55.958
A bit much, yes.

19:56.041 --> 20:00.500
Plus, life in here is way easier.
I'm doing yoga, learning to cross-stitch.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.458
I'm even catching up
on Great British Bake Off.

20:02.541 --> 20:03.666
It's amazing, right?

20:03.750 --> 20:06.791
Macarons and macaroons. I had no idea.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.083
I know.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.625
Well, I get it.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.500
At this point, I just wish the guy
would forget about me completely.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.333
You know, if that's what you want,

20:14.416 --> 20:17.625
you could always just rebuild
Project Gaslight.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.666
The blueprints for it
are still at my volcanic island lair.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.833
While you're at it,
would you mind feeding my evil cat?

20:22.916 --> 20:26.583
I've never wiped
someone's mind completely blank.

20:26.666 --> 20:28.333
-It seems--
-Evil?

20:28.416 --> 20:30.333
You are a mad scientist, are you not?

20:30.416 --> 20:32.375
I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.250
But you do want to take over
the world, right?

20:34.333 --> 20:35.416
Everyone wants that.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.375
Honey, denial isn't just a river
I tried to steal with a laser.

20:39.458 --> 20:42.875
I'm a good person. I just need to finish
this one thing. I'll need some--

20:42.958 --> 20:44.291
-Henchmen?
-Friends.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.625
Let's keep it up, guys.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.041
After this,
we can go back to our normal lives.

20:49.125 --> 20:53.250
Reagan, do we really have to build
this huge machine? Can't you just milk me?

20:53.333 --> 20:56.083
Jesus, Myc,
that is your solution for everything.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.500
We have to brainwash Congress.
Milk me.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.583
There was a terrorist attack. Milk me.

21:00.666 --> 21:01.500
It's not enough.

21:01.583 --> 21:05.291
Rafe is hardwired with decades
of codependency and toxic masculinity.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.750
-On top of that, he's obsessed with me.
-Brag.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.458
Fixing this is gonna take
something stronger.

21:10.541 --> 21:12.750
Well,
you don't have to insult my goo.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.333
Well, hey there, little buddy. I--

21:16.416 --> 21:20.333
-Oh, ow! Goddamn evil cat! God!

21:20.416 --> 21:23.458
I'll be right back. I'm gonna raid
SkullFinger's closet for a clean shirt.

21:23.541 --> 21:25.041
Could I pull off a black turtleneck?

21:25.125 --> 21:27.458
You guys would tell me
if I couldn't pull that off, right?

21:32.250 --> 21:34.208
Oh!

21:34.291 --> 21:37.041
Nothing like the intimacy
of a tandem jump.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.916
I feel so close to you.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.125
Ah!

21:40.708 --> 21:43.250
-Oh. Excellent work, Agent Hand.
-Oh.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.541
Now, remember your training,

21:44.625 --> 21:47.708
and you'll be getting
your double-0 status in no time.

21:47.791 --> 21:50.208
Wow, so you mentioned me to MI6?

21:50.291 --> 21:52.666
Oh, well, I mean, not yet,
but I'm going to,

21:52.750 --> 21:55.333
just as soon as we're done
with this mission.

21:55.416 --> 21:57.291
Once I find that killer,

21:57.375 --> 22:01.541
I'm going to shoot so many people,
it will make the American news.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.250
Oh man.

22:09.291 --> 22:11.708
Knock, knock. Who's there?

22:11.791 --> 22:12.833
Death.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.333
-And Brett.
-How did you find us?

22:15.416 --> 22:18.666
I simply activated my tracker
in Reagan's cell phone.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.958
You installed a tracker in Reagan's phone?

22:21.041 --> 22:24.125
Uh, yes, obviously.
I do that in every relationship.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.875
-Don't you guys?
-No, I don't.

22:25.958 --> 22:27.833
-That's fucked up.
-That's being a stalker.

22:27.916 --> 22:29.333
Whatever, I'm a spy.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.750
-Now, where is the man

22:30.833 --> 22:33.083
who killed my girlfriend? Where is he?

22:33.166 --> 22:35.000
Not so fast, Rafe.

22:35.083 --> 22:36.916
Brett. But why?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.250
If being a secret agent
means that I have to be like you,

22:39.333 --> 22:40.375
then I don't want to.

22:40.458 --> 22:43.208
You're not suave and cool.
You're insecure.

22:43.291 --> 22:46.041
-And honestly, kind of a huge misogynist.
-Uh, yeah.

22:46.125 --> 22:47.250
-A little bit.
-Totally.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.500
It's almost like guys with weapons
are compensating for something.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.375
Hell yeah!

22:52.458 --> 22:55.333
This bad boy's got some fucking firepower!

22:55.416 --> 22:56.791
Whoo! What? What'd I miss?

22:56.875 --> 22:59.583
So, unfortunately, Agent Masters,

22:59.666 --> 23:01.625
your time has run out.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.375
-Nice pun.
-Well-done.

23:07.458 --> 23:08.916
-Tagline worthy.
-Mm-hmm.

23:10.666 --> 23:13.666
What's happening? What's going on?

23:16.666 --> 23:20.083
What's wrong, Rafe?
Don't like being tied down?

23:20.166 --> 23:22.666
You know, this look
is actually an improvement for you.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.291
Shit, that stings.

23:24.375 --> 23:26.000
Wait a second. Reagan?

23:26.083 --> 23:27.208
But… but you're dead.

23:27.291 --> 23:30.416
Yeah, and yet you still stalked me here.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.000
I mean, what is it gonna take?

23:32.083 --> 23:34.708
I was just trying to avoid
being the bad guy.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.125
And I guess I can see how that turned out.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.041
What are you going to do to me?

23:45.125 --> 23:48.916
Well, I was going to erase
every woman you've ever dated.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.750
No, not Chesty McThong
and Bosoms Naturale and Nora Gag Reflex.

23:54.833 --> 23:59.166
But I've learned that sometimes
the hard thing is the right thing.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.666
Rafe, I faked my death
because you're a clingy psycho.

24:02.750 --> 24:06.666
No, that's not possible.
I'm universally regarded as charming.

24:06.750 --> 24:10.166
You are a corny, regressive stereotype,

24:10.250 --> 24:14.583
and the only people who think you're cool
are dads or people that didn't have dads.

24:14.666 --> 24:15.666
Damn, that is accurate.

24:15.750 --> 24:16.791
And more than that,

24:16.875 --> 24:20.458
I don't think that we have
good sexual chemistry either!

24:20.541 --> 24:22.250
For a guy who's been
with thousands of women,

24:22.333 --> 24:24.583
you really don't seem to know
what you're doing down there!

24:24.666 --> 24:26.666
What is this, mind games?

24:26.750 --> 24:28.625
This is an honest conversation
with a woman.

24:28.708 --> 24:31.166
Stop, it's torture!

24:31.250 --> 24:34.291
You know what?
It's time that I did the right thing too.

24:34.375 --> 24:35.708
-Hello, Ann.

24:35.791 --> 24:38.125
I didn't die in a tuna net
on Deadliest Catch.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.208
I just didn't wanna see you anymore.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.541
Hello. Orgy Dome? It's Andre.

24:42.625 --> 24:45.750
I should have had the balls
to end things with you face-to-face

24:45.833 --> 24:47.250
and ass-to-ass.

24:47.333 --> 24:51.833
Hey, Rogan, why don't you ask Jamie
to pull up a clip of me dumping your ass?

24:51.916 --> 24:54.583
Reagan, I'm sorry
for picking Rafe over the team.

24:54.666 --> 24:56.125
I got caught up in the spy game,

24:56.208 --> 24:59.083
and, well, I guess
I was just too damn good at it.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.916
Brett, you were terrible at it.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.041
But it's okay. I'm sorry
for leaving you with that psycho.

25:04.125 --> 25:07.291
So, what do we do about him?

25:07.375 --> 25:09.708
I'll take it from here.

25:09.791 --> 25:12.875
-What are you doing here?
-Something you said stuck with me, Reagan.

25:12.958 --> 25:15.916
You're right. Rafe and I are meant to be.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.291
SkullFinger?
What are you going to do to me?

25:19.375 --> 25:20.916
Well, first of all,

25:21.000 --> 25:25.333
I'm going to use a solar-powered laser
to burn off your testicles.

25:25.416 --> 25:26.375
And then?

25:26.458 --> 25:29.375
Uh, do you guys wanna get out of here
before this gets weirder?

25:29.458 --> 25:30.958
-Immediately.
-This is an abomination.

25:31.041 --> 25:34.625
-I was already leaving.
-I would like to stay and watch, actually.

25:34.708 --> 25:36.625
Guys, thanks
for helping me out back there.

25:36.708 --> 25:39.166
I promise I will make it up to you
when we get back to the--

25:40.458 --> 25:42.541
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

25:42.625 --> 25:44.041
-Well, I was just--
-We were just--

25:44.541 --> 25:47.291
-We're taking the helicopter.
-All righty, see you Monday.

25:48.833 --> 25:51.208
Should one of us have warned J.R.
what he's about to--

25:51.291 --> 25:52.958
Who cares? We're off the clock.
