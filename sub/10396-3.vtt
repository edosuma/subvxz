Everything changes.

00:23.124 --> 00:28.795
Nothing changes at all.

Drinking at 4:30 in the

01:19.213 --> 01:22.048
afternoon, it's the perfect time

01:22.049 --> 01:23.883
when the light is just right.

01:23.884 --> 01:24.684
It's important.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.986
Also it's not too crowded.

01:26.987 --> 01:29.456
It's quiet.

01:29.457 --> 01:35.128
A man can have a drink, a pint,

01:35.129 --> 01:43.129
in a dignified fashion
free of care.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.309
Ice, son?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.977
No, thank you.

01:50.978 --> 01:51.811
Here you go.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.380
Thank you so much.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.815
So you're on holiday?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.150
Sort of.

01:57.151 --> 02:00.587
It's your first time in Glasgow?

02:00.588 --> 02:04.056
No, I've been in a
number of times before.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.160
I haven't been in
this pub before.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.196
Oldest in... 1510.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.149
1510, amazing.

02:24.512 --> 02:31.083
From my very first
time, it was Glasgow.

02:31.084 --> 02:34.020
My favorite city in Scotland.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.888
One of my favorite
cities on earth.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.524
It was going to say one of my

02:37.525 --> 02:41.761
favorite cities in Europe,
but is Glasgow Europe?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.696
I don't think so.

02:43.697 --> 02:50.237
It feels somehow
older than that.

02:50.238 --> 02:53.373
To many outsiders, Glasgow is

02:53.374 --> 02:55.808
seen as a hard scrabble, even

02:55.809 --> 02:57.076
fearsome place, a place that

02:57.077 --> 02:58.945
history has moved on from, but

02:58.946 --> 03:01.248
there is definitely a sense here

03:01.249 --> 03:05.552
that something different
is around the corner.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.287
It'll be one of the most

03:07.288 --> 03:10.723
important events in Scottish
and British history.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.725
More than 4 million people will

03:12.726 --> 03:13.726
decide whether Scotland should

03:13.727 --> 03:16.896
stay in the U.K. Or become
an independent country.

03:16.897 --> 03:21.234
Will Scotland stay or
will it leave the union?

03:21.235 --> 03:22.835
Scottish independence could

03:22.836 --> 03:26.072
Mark the beginning of the end of

03:26.073 --> 03:27.240
the U.K. As we know it.

03:27.241 --> 03:34.080
But in the end, 55% of Scotts

03:34.081 --> 03:35.982
voted to stay in the union.

03:35.983 --> 03:39.151
That left almost half the
population still hungry for

03:39.152 --> 03:41.153
independence and with 17.5% of

03:41.154 --> 03:45.425
teenagers voting yes, England

03:45.426 --> 03:48.761
had its undies in a bunch over

03:48.762 --> 03:55.968
the possibility of an
unraveling Scotland.

03:55.969 --> 04:03.969
Glasgow is a gutsy city.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.948
Different outlook.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.817
New generation, but I still here

04:10.818 --> 04:14.287
the cries of yesterday.

04:14.288 --> 04:17.857
Why does the possibility of
independence have such a

04:17.858 --> 04:22.795
powerful hold on Glasgow?

04:22.796 --> 04:23.063
The past.

04:23.064 --> 04:25.064
Glasgow has along endured among

04:25.065 --> 04:27.166
other things a reputation for

04:27.167 --> 04:29.402
being the most violent
area in the U.K.

04:29.403 --> 04:35.742
It's a familiar cycle, amal gos

04:35.743 --> 04:37.410
in many ways to what
we see elsewhere.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.579
Hard times, unemployment, a

04:39.580 --> 04:42.815
general sense of apathy that the

04:42.816 --> 04:44.884
government can't or won't fix

04:44.885 --> 04:46.819
what's broken, that in the

04:46.820 --> 04:51.858
corridors of power of London,

04:51.859 --> 04:55.895
they just don't give a
shit about Glasgow.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.164
Especially Glasgow's east side.

04:58.165 --> 05:02.402
Like most cities,
Glasgow is divided.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.936
The river divides the north and

05:03.937 --> 05:06.339
south sides, but the bigger more

05:06.340 --> 05:09.776
tangible divide is
between east and west.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.712
The west, things are
expected to be, well, nice.

05:12.713 --> 05:16.516
Nice cars, nice families, all

05:16.517 --> 05:20.953
the nice stuff that affluence
supposedly brings.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.855
East side, that's where you grow

05:22.856 --> 05:26.459
up hard, where things are
rougher, where you've got,

05:26.460 --> 05:29.061
according to popular legend, to

05:29.062 --> 05:34.701
fight to live every day.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.970
In Scotland, if you're a

05:37.971 --> 05:40.039
young boy in Scotland and you're

05:40.040 --> 05:42.375
9 or 10 and you're coming home

05:42.376 --> 05:44.043
from school a big guy beats you

05:44.044 --> 05:47.714
up and you run home crying,
you know what she'll do?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.882
She'll give you a cuddle and

05:49.883 --> 05:53.920
then she'll tell you get
back there and get him.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.889
Don't let anybody
ever do that to you.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.591
That's what we do.

05:58.592 --> 06:03.396
And it makes us dangerous

06:03.397 --> 06:04.897
enemies, resourceful enemies,

06:04.898 --> 06:09.836
but it also makes us
very loyal allies.

06:09.837 --> 06:13.840
Detective John Karnish 38

06:13.841 --> 06:16.308
years on the job, much of it is

06:16.309 --> 06:17.744
murder police on the east side.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.947
He's seen it all.

06:20.948 --> 06:25.652
Confronted with violent
hooliganism, the traditional

06:25.653 --> 06:28.821
approach has been to get out

06:28.822 --> 06:32.925
there, bust some heads,
lock up some perpetrators.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.762
But after decades of dealing

06:35.763 --> 06:39.799
with generation after generation
of violence, he took a

06:39.800 --> 06:40.332
controversial new tactic.

06:40.333 --> 06:44.537
Along with a colleague, he

06:44.538 --> 06:46.506
established a new unit called

06:46.507 --> 06:47.774
the violence reduction effort

06:47.775 --> 06:51.778
and focused their efforts on the

06:51.779 --> 06:58.217
social problems he felt led
directly to violent crime.

06:58.218 --> 07:03.289
As of 2014, Scotland is at a 40

07:03.290 --> 07:05.124
year low of violent crime.

07:05.125 --> 07:10.463
When in town, though,
he likes to come here.

07:10.464 --> 07:15.334
Typical Scottish
fare, mother India.

07:15.335 --> 07:18.471
For a curry served in spicy

07:18.472 --> 07:23.309
gravy served with traditional
non-Scottish bread.

07:23.310 --> 07:27.246
I know Glasgow is a
traditionally tough town.

07:27.247 --> 07:31.518
I've always seen it as a
warm and welcoming place.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.353
Do you think the town's
reputation is deserved or is

07:34.354 --> 07:36.889
this a... nope.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.325
I mean in terms of labeling the

07:39.326 --> 07:42.695
violence, the fights
are the fights.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.232
But statistically, if you don't

07:46.233 --> 07:48.434
live or come from Glasgow, your

07:48.435 --> 07:51.838
chances of being a victim of a

07:51.839 --> 07:58.244
violent attack in Glasgow
is something like .000.

07:58.245 --> 08:02.615
I've done a fair amount of
stupid behavior here, a fair

08:02.616 --> 08:05.351
amount of drinking, a fair

08:05.352 --> 08:06.252
amount of putting myself in the

08:06.253 --> 08:09.556
sort of situations they advise

08:09.557 --> 08:13.893
visitors to a new
town not to take.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.795
I've never felt
uncomfortable here.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.565
I could be wrong in that after a

08:18.566 --> 08:22.201
few drinks I notice that I
don't understand anyone.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.070
They could be making various

08:24.071 --> 08:26.038
threats of violence to me at the

08:26.039 --> 08:33.245
bar, and I could just
be smiling and nodding.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.148
Indian food is, of course,

08:36.149 --> 08:39.919
huge here as it is
everywhere in the U.K.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.488
You could venture to guess that

08:42.489 --> 08:46.759
the cold, damp weather causes

08:46.760 --> 08:52.732
the heart to yearn for
food from spicy climates.

08:52.733 --> 08:56.102
That whole takeover India thing.

08:56.103 --> 09:02.108
All I can say is pass this.

09:02.109 --> 09:06.679
So how do you reduce violence?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.348
I mean traditionally we
would just get more police.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.417
Crack some skulls
and problem solved.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.319
A good number of Americans

09:13.320 --> 09:15.254
probably still believe
that very much.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.957
We're very fond of
throwing people in prison.

09:17.958 --> 09:18.991
To suggest otherwise would be

09:18.992 --> 09:21.928
seen as coddling criminals.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.831
Absolutely, and it
was the same here.

09:24.832 --> 09:30.436
We started to think about
it entirely different ways.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.171
Violence is a public
health issue.

09:32.172 --> 09:39.211
We all have the
capacity for violence.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.280
People at home learn
not to be violent.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.316
Things that happen then will

09:44.317 --> 09:44.984
effect their whole life course

09:44.985 --> 09:46.385
about how they make decisions

09:46.386 --> 09:48.487
about themselves and
how they judge risk.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.456
No matter how good the police

09:50.457 --> 09:52.825
service is, it will just contain

09:52.826 --> 09:53.993
and manage the problem.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.628
It won't make it better.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.529
First of all, it's not what I

09:57.530 --> 09:59.799
expect to hear from somebody who

09:59.800 --> 10:03.535
spent 30 years with murder
police, busting heads with

10:03.536 --> 10:11.243
people, that we should hug
these bastards more...

10:11.244 --> 10:16.482
Yes, absolutely.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.686
Everything you've said...
This is going to take a

10:19.687 --> 10:19.987
generation.

10:19.988 --> 10:24.056
They go, oh, politicians
don't have a generation.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.559
They're worried about the
newscast on Monday at 6:00.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.829
The headlines, absolutely.

10:29.830 --> 10:34.934
We don't have it sorted here,
but we're on a journey.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.769
So what's going right here?

10:36.770 --> 10:44.110
This is one of the most
awesome cities anywhere.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.079
People.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.024
I say shit we can't
keep doing this.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.695
Let's try something different.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.653
Look, I don't want to give

11:27.654 --> 11:35.654
you the impression that
Glasgow is an impoverished

11:35.963 --> 11:43.836
wasteland filled
with violence and

11:43.837 --> 11:45.071
hooligans.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.839
Let's face it.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.908
Detroit or New Orleans, most

11:48.909 --> 11:56.909
American cities make this
town look like club med by

11:57.317 --> 11:58.785
comparison.

11:58.786 --> 12:05.191
Glasgow remains the
region's noble shit zone.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.160
What I find most endearing in

12:08.161 --> 12:10.162
this town is if you're a native,

12:10.163 --> 12:16.702
you're probably an
expert at taking a piss.

12:16.703 --> 12:21.607
Well, it's good to be
back at work again.

12:21.608 --> 12:25.978
No one excels more at
deflating the pompous, making

12:25.979 --> 12:29.115
fun of self-importance, turning

12:29.116 --> 12:37.116
even the darkest tragedy
into comedy than them.

12:37.858 --> 12:43.329
That is, if you can
understand the bastards.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.131
This can be a challenge after a

12:45.132 --> 12:48.901
couple of pints of heavy.

12:48.902 --> 12:53.806
Glasgow has a reputation of
being a hard drinking, two

12:53.807 --> 12:54.307
fisted town.

12:54.308 --> 12:55.141
Yeah.

12:55.142 --> 12:59.846
I've always found it to
be this very funny town.

12:59.847 --> 13:03.315
Very dark humor.

13:03.316 --> 13:08.354
If you say in America,
my father died.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.822
People are immediately
sympathetic.

13:09.823 --> 13:17.823
If you say it here, they say
what size was his shoes.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.268
We have that.

13:22.269 --> 13:29.675
Jamie Godley grew up on the
east end, married into an

13:29.676 --> 13:31.077
organized crime dynasty, worked

13:31.078 --> 13:35.414
as a bartender, became a very

13:35.415 --> 13:43.355
famous playwright, author,
and stand-up comedian.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.557
I thought I'd meet her here at a

13:45.558 --> 13:46.893
very old-school institution.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.695
She's working some goat
cheese thing with figs.

13:49.696 --> 13:56.869
For me, Scottish oysters are
an irresistible impulse.

13:56.870 --> 14:01.440
They are magnificent,
by the way.

14:01.441 --> 14:05.978
What a lot of people abroad

14:05.979 --> 14:11.383
don't understand is wine is the

14:11.384 --> 14:13.052
backbone of the industry.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.388
That still exists, Tony.

14:16.389 --> 14:22.061
The age expectancy is still 55.

14:22.062 --> 14:25.464
In Iraq, it is still 65.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.466
Wow, that's still an
extraordinary thing.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.401
Yeah, I know.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.770
I think the fact that we are a

14:31.771 --> 14:34.340
bit shit helps us because we

14:34.341 --> 14:36.008
have the commonwealth games here

14:36.009 --> 14:37.743
and I loved that everybody tried

14:37.744 --> 14:42.481
not to shout in the street and

14:42.482 --> 14:47.353
swear and sell stolen
goods in public.

14:47.354 --> 14:50.422
I loved the operation of
let's be nice for a week.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.290
I loved that.

14:51.291 --> 14:57.363
Main course, Jamie goes
for the pan-fried grill.

14:57.364 --> 15:05.364
I can't pass up the fabulously
loved dish, lobster

15:11.211 --> 15:12.011
thermostat.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.213
It is Scottish, as is the

15:14.214 --> 15:17.449
cheese, eggs, everything really.

15:17.450 --> 15:21.320
Do you have anything
to say on the diet?

15:21.321 --> 15:25.624
The diet, it's
really interesting.

15:25.625 --> 15:33.625
The healthwise as far as
heart problems right behind

15:35.902 --> 15:36.303
Tonga.

15:36.304 --> 15:43.209
When I was a kid, we ate fish,
butter beans, potatoes.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.676
Then we would have liver and

15:44.677 --> 15:48.747
onions and potatoes
and cabbage and peas.

15:48.748 --> 15:53.519
Somewhere from the mid 70s

15:53.520 --> 15:55.854
onwards, it just became crap.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.324
Now you have a generation of

15:58.325 --> 16:00.859
women who don't know how
to make a pot of soup.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.929
To be a real housewife, you have

16:03.930 --> 16:06.198
to be able to make
a pot of soup.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.067
I can't make soup.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.836
The joke is I'm
apparently good at sex.

16:10.837 --> 16:13.172
Sex takes five minutes.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.107
Soup takes five days.

16:15.108 --> 16:23.108
My husband has never
asked for soup.

16:25.518 --> 16:30.556
There's a terrific music
scene in Glasgow.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.192
The pubs are among
the finest anywhere.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.894
They say they have more fun at a

16:35.895 --> 16:41.633
funeral than people in Eden
borough have at a wedding.

16:41.634 --> 16:47.573
That does invite, from time to

16:47.574 --> 16:49.608
time, a fair amount of
knuckle-headed behaviors.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.745
If you're looking for a beer and

16:53.746 --> 16:56.148
a beating, Glasgow will have it.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.551
The toughness thing is no joke.

16:59.552 --> 17:04.423
If you ever try to choke a small

17:04.424 --> 17:06.458
one into unconsciousness, as I

17:06.459 --> 17:10.096
have, long story, it is like

17:10.097 --> 17:13.632
wrestling with an
angry fire plug.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.566
Also it hurts.

17:14.567 --> 17:22.567
Access to guns is
extremely difficult here.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.515
The old country way.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.649
One person at a time.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.618
A stabbing might not get more

17:32.619 --> 17:36.655
than a few lines down in a

17:36.656 --> 17:39.958
column in the Glasgow papers,

17:39.959 --> 17:42.428
because in this city, ordinary

17:42.429 --> 17:45.364
stabbing is hardly news anymore.

17:45.365 --> 17:49.000
Where violence is an affliction,
there must be a cure.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.602
He began his career working as a

17:50.603 --> 17:55.441
bouncer in some of the east
side's toughest drinking

17:55.442 --> 17:58.110
establishments where he had

17:58.111 --> 18:01.180
plenty of opportunities
to hone his skill.

18:01.181 --> 18:05.717
Now he runs tactical edge.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.886
Come at him with a knife, the

18:07.887 --> 18:09.521
overwhelming likelihood is that

18:09.522 --> 18:12.458
it will soon be hanging
out of your ass.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.059
Generally these courses start

18:14.060 --> 18:16.495
come at me with a knife and a

18:16.496 --> 18:21.567
guy comes at you like
it is Friday 13th.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.803
Nobody outside "Friday 13th" has

18:24.804 --> 18:26.972
ever come at anybody like this.

18:26.973 --> 18:31.643
If somebody does come, they're

18:31.644 --> 18:35.481
rushing at you with multiple...

18:35.482 --> 18:43.482
In a manic, frenzy of
slashing movements.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.156
Yeah.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.825
You tend to get these
repeated lines of attack.

18:46.826 --> 18:52.198
If they're going for the

18:52.199 --> 18:54.833
stomach, it is a sewing
machine kind of action.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.403
Is your first order of
business deflecting or getting

18:57.404 --> 18:58.404
the knife from them?

18:58.405 --> 19:00.272
I'm going to either gain

19:00.273 --> 19:05.010
control of the weapon or go to a

19:05.011 --> 19:05.544
returning blade technique.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.212
Right.

19:06.213 --> 19:10.182
Show me.

19:10.183 --> 19:10.683
Okay.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.692
The thing about knife defense is

19:20.693 --> 19:24.430
there's no magic bullet.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.198
Any technique can fail.

19:26.199 --> 19:30.702
Any technique can go wrong.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.771
If there's multiple opponents,

19:32.772 --> 19:37.543
that can get difficult as well.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.878
Here, this sort of thing, yeah?

19:39.879 --> 19:43.215
If we've got the knife held up

19:43.216 --> 19:45.951
close, okay, yeah, pull hit.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.053
Now I'm going to force this

19:48.054 --> 19:53.892
thing back into your sternum
repeatedly like I'm a

19:53.893 --> 19:54.227
woodpecker.

19:54.228 --> 20:02.228
Put your hands up, brute
force, forth, charge.

20:02.502 --> 20:06.838
That's it.

20:06.839 --> 20:07.339
Charge.

20:13.946 --> 20:18.584
So ATM mugging, I'm going to pin

20:18.585 --> 20:19.685
your hand to me so I own the

20:19.686 --> 20:22.321
weapon and I'm going to slap
backwards into the groin.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.256
I'm going to hit, come up, grab.

20:24.257 --> 20:32.257
Now I'm going to introduce
point a with point B.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.670
You're going to want to let go,

20:38.671 --> 20:44.843
so bang, bang, bang, bang.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.646
This is a little bit more
close and sort of vicious.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.780
Everybody doesn't see it.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.783
I've cleared the weapon.

20:51.784 --> 20:59.784
Shift yourself, knee him in
the balls, straight under.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.461
That was an education.

21:02.462 --> 21:02.795
No problem.

21:02.796 --> 21:04.764
I enjoyed that.

21:36.329 --> 21:40.832
Last night in Glasgow I had

21:40.833 --> 21:42.734
enough with the deeper issues.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.336
Now I want to go no deeper than

21:44.337 --> 21:52.337
the bottom of a bubbling
calduron of haggis.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.881
A happy place from my past where

21:55.882 --> 21:58.350
once I frolicked young and

21:58.351 --> 22:01.620
carefree in the field
of fried arts.

22:01.621 --> 22:06.958
The university cafe where I
learned at the foot of the

22:06.959 --> 22:10.629
masters the Dao of hot
fat and crispy batter.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.932
Yes, they do a deep-fried Mars

22:13.933 --> 22:15.634
bar and deep-fried pizza.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.536
Been there, done that.

22:17.537 --> 22:22.874
They've been keeping the
tradition alive since 1918 and

22:22.875 --> 22:30.875
it ain't about no Mars bar.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.586
> I'm tempted to go completely

22:34.587 --> 22:38.890
nuts for all the things I like,

22:38.891 --> 22:42.961
like pies, beans, and chips.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.063
Cheese beano, I don't know what

22:45.064 --> 22:49.401
that is, but I kind of want it.

22:49.402 --> 22:50.736
Ooh, sausage roll.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.972
I do like a good sausage.

22:53.973 --> 22:57.909
I order the fish and
chips and some haggis.

22:57.910 --> 23:03.949
Haddock battered and floating, a

23:03.950 --> 23:06.585
drift in a sea of life-giving

23:06.586 --> 23:14.586
oil as it Bobs like Noah's
ark bringing life in all its

23:15.828 --> 23:17.128
infinite variety.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.664
In tube form in this case.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.599
If you don't like chopped up

23:20.600 --> 23:26.705
liver and lungs and all
that stuff, believe me.

23:26.706 --> 23:34.706
The curry sauce sets you right.

23:35.882 --> 23:41.487
Guy Fieri in a kilt,
but what the hey.

23:41.488 --> 23:45.857
I'm pretty sure god
is against this.

23:45.858 --> 23:53.799
Oh, yeah, definitely.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.365
That's good.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.668
Doesn't eat well with a fork.

23:56.669 --> 24:02.307
You really have to pick this up.

24:02.308 --> 24:03.056
So ashamed.

24:19.492 --> 24:23.328
Oh, yeah.

24:23.329 --> 24:26.865
Clean living.

24:26.866 --> 24:34.866
That's really one of
life's great pleasures.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.174
Don't let them tell
you otherwise.

24:36.175 --> 24:39.611
They're lying about you, Mr.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.679
Haggis.

24:40.680 --> 24:45.183
There was no other reviled
food on earth than haggis.

24:45.184 --> 24:49.588
It's ingredients are no
more unusual or bizarre or

24:49.589 --> 24:53.191
unappetizing than any
hot dog you ever ate.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.760
How many anal glands are
in a chicken nugget?

24:54.761 --> 24:57.362
I don't know and I'm not

24:57.363 --> 24:59.030
suggesting there are anal glands

24:59.031 --> 25:04.069
in a chicken nugget, but would

25:04.070 --> 25:05.303
you be surprised if there were?

25:05.304 --> 25:07.273
Back to you, wolf.

25:25.491 --> 25:32.263
Heading north out of
Glasgow, Scotland quickly

25:32.264 --> 25:34.566
becomes something else.

25:34.567 --> 25:38.069
A savagely beautiful harsh, but

25:38.070 --> 25:41.740
absolutely mesmerizing landscape

25:41.741 --> 25:42.974
that seems to have changed not

25:42.975 --> 25:44.743
at all for thousands,
even millions of years.

25:44.744 --> 25:49.648
And across loch Marie and only

25:49.649 --> 25:51.983
accessible by boat, one of the

25:51.984 --> 25:58.256
great isolated
estates, letter U.

25:58.257 --> 26:01.860
It's the favorite retreat
of my friend, Adrian Gill.

26:01.861 --> 26:05.496
More widely known as a Gill.

26:05.497 --> 26:08.934
He's the much feared and widely

26:08.935 --> 26:11.302
followed restaurant critic for

26:11.303 --> 26:15.140
the "London Sunday times,"

26:15.141 --> 26:17.843
author, traveler, and one of the

26:17.844 --> 26:20.712
finest essayists of our time.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.614
Letter U. As it stands today was

26:22.615 --> 26:24.015
built as a shooting lodge.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.451
Deer stalking like they do here

26:26.452 --> 26:28.153
is something from another era,

26:28.154 --> 26:34.125
but it persists in places like

26:34.126 --> 26:36.628
this which both protect and
cull deer populations.

26:36.629 --> 26:40.298
If you are, like us, of course,

26:40.299 --> 26:43.969
two murderous aristocrats
looking to put venison on the

26:43.970 --> 26:47.072
table, you need help,
professional help.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.240
Stephen Miller has been working

26:49.241 --> 26:51.142
here for eight seasons now, both

26:51.143 --> 26:53.078
protecting the animals who live

26:53.079 --> 26:55.480
on it and helping people like us

26:55.481 --> 26:57.649
in the arduous and delicate task

26:57.650 --> 27:02.020
of sneaking up on them.

27:02.021 --> 27:05.657
We would as gentlemen of leisure

27:05.658 --> 27:08.994
require a cook and Adrian has

27:08.995 --> 27:13.164
recommended a well-suited woman

27:13.165 --> 27:16.334
who excels at this
Scottish game cookery.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.738
For dinner, it's grouse.

27:19.739 --> 27:25.610
Shot, then hung until the
already funky game bird gets

27:25.611 --> 27:26.012
pleasingly ripe.

27:26.013 --> 27:27.578
The birds are rubbed inside and

27:27.579 --> 27:35.086
out with salt and pepper, some

27:35.087 --> 27:36.922
fresh thyme jammed
in the cavity.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.356
Bread sauce is a must.

27:38.357 --> 27:43.461
We don't do this in America,
but here it's essential.

27:43.462 --> 27:46.364
Basically it's milk simmered

27:46.365 --> 27:48.399
with flavoring agent like nutmeg

27:48.400 --> 27:55.473
and bay leaf and then thickened
with raspings of bread.

27:55.474 --> 28:01.880
Grouse barded with bacon,
then roasted in the oven.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.382
They are moved to rest.

28:04.383 --> 28:07.652
Game stock is added and the

28:07.653 --> 28:08.887
sauce reduced, topped with water

28:08.888 --> 28:16.888
cross along side with
parsnips and beet root.

28:18.731 --> 28:19.364
So explain what we're eating,

28:19.365 --> 28:20.265
because this is as
classic as it gets?

28:20.266 --> 28:21.499
This is specifically Scottish.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.769
This is a grouse, which is the

28:23.770 --> 28:27.472
only truly wild game
bird in Britain.

28:27.473 --> 28:33.078
They're the most highly
prized as a sporting bird.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.145
They're the most difficult to

28:34.146 --> 28:35.646
shoot, but more importantly

28:35.647 --> 28:37.448
they're the most prized to eat.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.418
This bread sauce
thing, what is that?

28:40.419 --> 28:43.588
Bread sauce, you have to
grow up here to love this.

28:43.589 --> 28:47.092
It is like pottage.

28:47.093 --> 28:47.426
It's soft.

28:47.427 --> 28:53.431
It's a very old dish, but it
goes very well... grouse,

28:53.432 --> 28:56.601
they're a very gamey meat.

28:56.602 --> 29:00.972
It's a very grown-up taste that

29:00.973 --> 29:05.443
is slightly repellant, but

29:05.444 --> 29:08.313
within that, it is
particularly Al alluring.

29:08.314 --> 29:08.714
Right.

29:08.715 --> 29:12.283
There is something also
sexual about it that people

29:12.284 --> 29:13.284
don't often talk about.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.154
Right, right.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.222
So good.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.791
I'm going to a
vegetarian school.

29:19.792 --> 29:26.965
My parents sent me to a
vegetarian boarding school, and

29:26.966 --> 29:29.901
for nine years, the year after I

29:29.902 --> 29:31.069
left, I was a vegetarian.

29:31.070 --> 29:35.974
Nine years as a vegetarian,
that's unthinkable to me.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.708
Then I decided not to be.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.410
I made the decision if I was

29:39.411 --> 29:41.346
going to eat meat again, then I

29:41.347 --> 29:43.381
had to be prepared to
do the whole business.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.316
Right.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.985
You've got to be accountable.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.320
For all of it.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.056
For all of it.

29:51.057 --> 29:54.325
So I started with the fish and

29:54.326 --> 29:56.327
getting the guts and gutting it.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.595
You want to eat it?

29:57.596 --> 29:58.663
Come and kill it.

29:58.664 --> 30:02.567
You go, well, then I
have to do that as well.

30:02.568 --> 30:09.007
When I started doing it,
it was like coming home.

30:09.008 --> 30:17.008
And that's the thing
with being on the hill.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.025
Until the 19th century, the

30:27.026 --> 30:29.027
Scottish highlands were seen by

30:29.028 --> 30:32.197
many as a mysterious, hostile,

30:32.198 --> 30:34.065
and dangerous land, populated

30:34.066 --> 30:37.702
when populated at all by scary

30:37.703 --> 30:44.409
ass barbarians, tribes so
ferocious, so extravagant in

30:44.410 --> 30:46.411
their violence and toughness

30:46.412 --> 30:49.948
that even in the Roman legions

30:49.949 --> 30:52.951
decided not to mess with them,

30:52.952 --> 30:54.285
hoping to keep them out of the

30:54.286 --> 30:56.387
way of civilized society.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.223
Later hunting estates like this

30:58.224 --> 31:05.230
were home to farmers who
scrounged a living by growing

31:05.231 --> 31:05.497
potatoes.

31:05.498 --> 31:13.104
The highland clans
later by newer money.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.006
Today around half the land in

31:15.007 --> 31:23.007
Scotland is owned by
fewer than 500 people.

31:25.351 --> 31:30.922
It's seductive as well.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.091
Who wouldn't do this,
if they could?

31:33.092 --> 31:38.429
Enjoy this kind of rugged

31:38.430 --> 31:41.299
solitude from a warm,
inviting 17th century lodge.

31:41.300 --> 31:47.105
Play a little snooker, enjoy
a single malt or two, the

31:47.106 --> 31:53.678
substantial game meal, maybe
another whiskey perhaps,

31:53.679 --> 31:56.647
contemplate the mysteries of the

31:56.648 --> 31:57.882
universe under the sky and then

31:57.883 --> 32:04.322
to sleep in the arms of

32:04.323 --> 32:06.624
Morpheus, then to rise in the

32:06.625 --> 32:10.195
morning as bringer of death.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.897
Stephen and Adrian keep calling

32:12.898 --> 32:16.367
it the hill, but that ain't
no hill I've ever seen.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.637
It's a behemoth, an endless

32:19.638 --> 32:22.640
range of behemoths, one mountain

32:22.641 --> 32:30.641
way giving away to a moor, then

32:31.984 --> 32:37.688
another, then
another, then more.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.824
It's a daunting hike.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.326
The climb gradual, then steep.

32:41.327 --> 32:46.731
The footing ranging from
rocky to spongy and wet.

32:46.732 --> 32:47.398
Mile after mile.

32:47.399 --> 32:50.535
Me trying to look cool, make it

32:50.536 --> 32:52.003
seem like this is nothing

32:52.004 --> 32:56.975
unusual, but really I'm dying.

33:12.858 --> 33:16.361
We walked the
highlands for hours.

33:16.362 --> 33:20.365
Our stalker Stephen finally
identifies a red stag of

33:20.366 --> 33:23.268
suitable age and size, one ready

33:23.269 --> 33:25.103
in parlance to be
taken off the hill.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.938
Getting in a range without

33:27.939 --> 33:29.974
scaring them off, however,
is another challenge.

33:29.975 --> 33:32.410
We need to circle around the

33:32.411 --> 33:33.744
mountain to close the distance.

33:33.745 --> 33:41.745
There's not a lot I can do.

33:43.722 --> 33:51.722
So we go slowly.

33:52.498 --> 33:59.337
Just pretend we're
hikers at the moment.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.071
Bobble hat.

34:00.072 --> 34:00.638
What?

34:00.639 --> 34:03.241
If you put a bobble hat on,

34:03.242 --> 34:11.242
the deer think you're a hiker.

34:19.024 --> 34:23.860
Can you see the antlers?

34:23.862 --> 34:24.362
Yeah.

34:31.303 --> 34:31.915
Get down.

34:40.978 --> 34:48.978
Stay down, stay down.

34:52.491 --> 35:00.491
Dig in nice and steady.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.270
Take your time.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.069
That's a nice stag.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.004
Ten points.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.172
Is that good?

35:41.173 --> 35:45.743
He was never going
to get any better.

35:45.744 --> 35:50.281
Do you want to use your knife?

35:50.282 --> 35:53.252
♪

36:22.881 --> 36:29.220
For shooting your first
red stag in Scotland.

36:29.221 --> 36:32.823
You'll get blooded.

36:32.824 --> 36:33.058
Oh.

36:33.059 --> 36:41.059
Best if you close your eyes.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.067
Ah.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.736
Oh, okay.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.905
And the rule is you
have to leave it on.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.107
Yeah.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.077
All day.

37:09.328 --> 37:09.495
♪

37:09.496 --> 37:10.261
You going, chaps?

37:10.262 --> 37:16.867
As getting vehicles up here
would be both physical and

37:16.868 --> 37:18.336
destructive they use highland

37:18.337 --> 37:20.605
ponies to retrieve
the stalked deer.

37:20.606 --> 37:24.208
They are bred to be strong
and trained to do this work.

37:24.209 --> 37:27.345
They will likely make it
back sooner than we will.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.814
Thanks, chaps.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.283
We'll catch you
around at some point.

37:32.284 --> 37:32.784
See ya.

37:36.522 --> 37:42.827
Good boys through.

37:42.828 --> 37:45.796
I thought coming up my legs

37:45.797 --> 37:47.031
burning, I can't wait until that

37:47.032 --> 37:49.300
nice easy downhill walk back,

37:49.301 --> 37:54.372
but as I soon find out, the
walk down is even harder.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.674
Knees screaming, face crusted

37:56.675 --> 37:59.043
with dry blood, I'm looking

37:59.044 --> 38:01.312
forward to a warm fire, a strong

38:01.313 --> 38:07.486
whiskey and spot good
country ass cooking.

38:49.528 --> 38:53.297
So venison stew with wine?

38:53.298 --> 38:56.967
They always marinate
Juniper and all of that.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.636
Super simple.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.137
Okay.

38:59.138 --> 38:59.937
We'll do that.

38:59.938 --> 39:00.438
♪

39:12.984 --> 39:14.084
The venison is seasoned with

39:14.085 --> 39:15.886
salt and pepper and Rosemary

39:15.887 --> 39:21.091
seared in duck fat and
then into the oven.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.893
A pan sauce made from the Fawn,

red wine and deep game stock,

sweetened with currentant jelly

whole butter and served with

clap shot, basically mashed turnips and potatoes.

39:47.453 --> 39:47.985
That's it.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.186
That's the end of the season.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.455
Hugely the girls will be killing

39:50.456 --> 39:52.657
it, and you start
killing the girls.

Have you traditionally where

39:53.659 --> 39:58.763
there's the leather mask to the

39:58.764 --> 40:00.431
stag and you... and you send

40:00.432 --> 40:03.834
them notes beforehand
saying I'm watching you.

40:03.835 --> 40:11.835
I know where you live.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.188
We deserve this.

We've worked for it, huh?

40:25.524 --> 40:28.559
Yeah.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.894
Literally the greatest feat

40:29.895 --> 40:33.464
of strength in my entire life.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.132
Never in my entire life have I

40:35.133 --> 40:37.635
done anything so remotely

40:37.636 --> 40:40.505
physical over a sustained
period of time.

40:40.506 --> 40:41.371
Really?

40:41.372 --> 40:42.640
Never.

40:42.641 --> 40:43.173
Look how well.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.810
At no point previously in my

40:45.811 --> 40:48.145
life would I have
been able to do it.

Thank you, guys.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.582
Here's to the best
of health, folks.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.917
All the best.

40:52.918 --> 40:53.684
Good shot.

40:53.685 --> 41:01.685
I say to a place for ramblers.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.562
A lot safer now that
we're not on our land.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.050
I came to Scotland this time

41:26.051 --> 41:28.452
to shoot an animal in the heart,

41:28.453 --> 41:30.120
to take part, to be fully

41:30.121 --> 41:34.925
culpable in a practice nearly
as old as these hills.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.460
You walk this country stalking

41:36.461 --> 41:37.962
an animal across the rocks and

41:37.963 --> 41:39.764
wet Heather, you feel little has

41:39.765 --> 41:41.298
changed from how your distant

41:41.299 --> 41:43.133
ancestors must have searched for

41:43.134 --> 41:47.905
their food with a rifle,
with a spear, with a club.

41:47.906 --> 41:50.274
I drag my knuckles up a hill and

41:50.275 --> 41:52.042
like my ape-like predecessors

41:52.043 --> 41:56.747
return tired, happy
and covered in blood.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.148
Everything changes.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.118
Nothing changes at all.
