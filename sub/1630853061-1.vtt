00:08.095 --> 00:10.227
Hello. I'm Randall Park.

00:10.271 --> 00:12.142
For the past few months,
I've sat down

00:12.186 --> 00:13.535
<i>with candidate Dwayne Johnson</i>

00:13.578 --> 00:15.885
<i>during his historic run</i>
<i>for president.</i>

00:15.928 --> 00:18.496
<i>We started out</i>
<i>as interviewer-interviewee.</i>

00:18.540 --> 00:21.021
<i>But then during the course</i>
<i>of his campaign,</i>

00:21.064 --> 00:22.413
<i>we became best friends.</i>

00:23.762 --> 00:25.460
Now, during my acting days,

00:25.503 --> 00:29.159
I learned to not pay attention
to critics.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.509
But if I did,
there was one consistent knock

00:31.553 --> 00:34.512
on our interviews:
we didn't go deep enough.

00:34.556 --> 00:37.733
So for the final two weeks
leading up to the election,

00:37.776 --> 00:39.387
Dwayne has agreed to give me

00:39.430 --> 00:43.086
unprecedented
behind-the-scenes access, 24-7.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.175
Welcome
to nature's iron paradise,

00:45.219 --> 00:47.786
aka the Johnson Family Ranch,

00:47.830 --> 00:48.918
where we'll be spending a--

00:53.575 --> 00:54.663
Oh.

00:54.706 --> 00:55.968
A peaceful weekend

00:56.012 --> 00:58.493
before the final push
on the campaign trail.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.195
- Hey, Randall,
it's good to see you, man.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.936
- Hey, Dwayne,
it's so great to be here.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.416
- It's good to have you here
with us, buddy,

01:08.459 --> 01:09.634
as we bring this thing home.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.375
Remember,
nothing is off-limits,

01:11.419 --> 01:13.160
so you can ask me anything.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.075
- If you had to get rid
of one breed of dog,

01:15.118 --> 01:17.207
which one would it be?

01:17.251 --> 01:18.643
Oh, uh, sorry.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.732
That was a write-in question
from one of our viewers.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.256
We'll get to those later.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.127
- We were just discussing
our election night event.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.172
Oh, right.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.216
Uh, so I know you don't like

01:26.260 --> 01:27.565
to count your chickens, Dwayne,

01:27.609 --> 01:30.177
but all the polls show
that on November 4th,

01:30.220 --> 01:31.526
you will be
our president-elect.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.876
- Knock on wood, right?

01:33.919 --> 01:35.051
- Oh, oh!
- A fish.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.748
- Oh, a fish!
A fish!

01:36.792 --> 01:38.141
Oh, oh, my gosh!

01:38.185 --> 01:39.099
- Look!
- There we go.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.058
- Hey, you caught one!
- I did.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.451
Oh, wow.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.366
- That's beautiful.
- She is beautiful.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.976
- Wanna touch her?
- I'm deathly afraid.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.151
- You are?
- Yeah.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.631
- Okay, she won't hurt you.
- Uh...

01:49.674 --> 01:50.806
Try it.

01:50.849 --> 01:51.807
- Ah!
- Oh, gosh!

01:51.850 --> 01:53.069
- Okay.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.418
- Yeah, let's uh--
- I'm gonna put her back.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.767
- Okay.
- All right.

01:55.811 --> 01:56.942
Great.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.335
Okay.

01:58.379 --> 01:59.597
- That's a good-looking fish.

01:59.641 --> 02:00.555
- Oh, can you hold this
for a second?

02:00.598 --> 02:01.860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.266
- Love you guys.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.267
I caught one!

02:17.311 --> 02:18.747
I also caught one. Look.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.184
- Look at that.
Yeah, that's the lure.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.794
- The lure?
- The lure, yeah.

02:22.838 --> 02:23.882
It looks like a fish.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.145
- Yeah, that's the whole
point of it.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.451
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.888
- Uh, so, Dwayne, question.
- Mm-hmm.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.194
Why "Desperado"?

02:31.238 --> 02:33.196
- Ah, it's a group text
with my daughters.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.372
I send them a voice memo
every week,

02:35.416 --> 02:37.026
and I sing them "Desperado."

02:37.069 --> 02:38.027
It's a little thing we do.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.289
Ah, it's a good dad move.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.769
I decided a long time ago

02:40.812 --> 02:43.206
that I was gonna make
my daughters a priority.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.990
You know...

02:45.034 --> 02:46.253
family comes first.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.124
- Mm, now, is that
something you learned

02:48.168 --> 02:49.299
from your own father?

02:49.343 --> 02:52.911
- Yeah, but not in the way
you would think.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.784
<i>And I loved my dad, but we had</i>
<i>a complicated relationship.</i>

02:55.827 --> 02:57.481
<i>- With the tag team belts</i>
<i>on the line,</i>

02:57.525 --> 03:00.005
<i>these guys are leaving nothing</i>
<i>on the table!</i>

03:00.049 --> 03:01.311
- Nice kick-out, Dad!

03:01.355 --> 03:02.530
Good sell by Afa.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.923
- Captain Lou sweats
so much for a man

03:04.967 --> 03:06.055
who's just walking around.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.099
<i>Rocky's in trouble!</i>

03:07.143 --> 03:08.188
<i>Pat, he's gotta find a way</i>

03:08.231 --> 03:09.667
<i>to tag in Tony Atlas.</i>

03:12.061 --> 03:14.890
<i>- I tell you,</i>
<i>the Samoans are in control!</i>

03:17.414 --> 03:19.982
<i>- Look at the power</i>
<i>of the Soul Man!</i>

03:21.679 --> 03:25.030
<i>Can he get to the corner</i>
<i>for a tag?</i>

03:25.074 --> 03:26.467
<i>Wait, that's not Tony Atlas.</i>

03:26.510 --> 03:27.468
<i>Who is that?</i>

03:33.082 --> 03:34.344
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

03:34.388 --> 03:36.955
<i>That's Rocky's son,</i>
<i>Dewey Johnson!</i>

03:36.999 --> 03:38.827
<i>Wow, Pat, what a son.</i>

03:43.353 --> 03:46.051
<i>Looks like the strongest</i>
<i>and the best boy in the world</i>

03:46.095 --> 03:47.139
<i>to me, Vince!</i>

03:47.183 --> 03:48.228
<i>- Dewey's a house of--</i>

03:48.271 --> 03:49.359
Oh, my God!

03:49.403 --> 03:50.752
Oh, my God!
Do you see that?

03:50.795 --> 03:53.929
- Whoo-hoo! They won!
<i>- We've got new champions!</i>

03:53.972 --> 03:56.714
<i>We've got new champions!</i>

03:56.758 --> 03:59.630
<i>- The "Soul Patrol" are</i>
<i>the new tag team champions</i>

03:59.674 --> 04:01.719
<i>of the World Wrestling</i>
<i>Federation!</i>

04:01.763 --> 04:03.504
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

04:05.114 --> 04:06.289
Agent Fong, FBI.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.291
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.379
I'm here for Lia Maivia.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.556
<i>As you may remember</i>

04:12.600 --> 04:14.558
<i>from our previous</i>
<i>conversations, Randall,</i>

04:14.602 --> 04:16.995
<i>the FBI got my grandmother</i>
<i>on tape</i>

04:17.039 --> 04:19.041
<i>threatening rival promoter</i>
<i>Greg Yao.</i>

04:19.084 --> 04:21.304
<i>- "Bang, bang."</i>
<i>Gives me goosebumps.</i>

04:21.348 --> 04:23.088
- FBI!

04:23.132 --> 04:24.351
Leave me alone.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.440
I'm here to celebrate
my son-in-law's victory.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.093
- Mrs. Maivia,
you can't be here.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.357
You're under house arrest
in an extortion case.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.662
This is a house.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.098
It has to be your house.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.752
Fine.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.624
I have to go to the store
anyway.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.279
- Again,
you can't leave your house.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.932
But I need groceries.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.761
- Eggs, bread, milk...
- That's not how--

04:45.110 --> 04:47.591
You know what, I have to go
to the store anyway.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.027
Just write down what you need.

04:49.071 --> 04:52.509
- Sorry, I don't write down
things for strangers.

04:54.206 --> 04:57.340
<i>- My grandmother was going</i>
<i>through a really intense time,</i>

04:57.384 --> 04:59.821
<i>but, man, I was just so pumped</i>

04:59.864 --> 05:02.258
<i>about my dad winning the belt.</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:03.868
<i>He promised to take us out</i>
<i>to celebrate</i>

05:03.912 --> 05:05.653
<i>when he got home, and he did.</i>

05:05.696 --> 05:06.784
<i>When I was a little boy,</i>

05:06.828 --> 05:08.482
<i>my dad was always a hero</i>
<i>to me,</i>

05:08.525 --> 05:09.831
<i>and now he was the champ.</i>

05:09.874 --> 05:11.136
- The other person
in your party

05:11.180 --> 05:12.312
has already arrived.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.313
Other person?

05:14.488 --> 05:15.619
- Hey.
- Tony!

05:15.663 --> 05:17.273
Glad you made it.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.666
- Aw, I wouldn't miss it,
brother.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.407
Hey, you brought your belt.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.973
Oh, yeah.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.323
Let me hold it.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.194
- Uh, but my dad said
I could hold it.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.369
Sorry, son.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.892
Co-champ trumps son of champ.

05:27.936 --> 05:30.808
- No, it's--
- I don't make the rules.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.637
Here we go.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.160
Now, you see this right here?

05:35.204 --> 05:36.466
This is my son.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.992
Sorry I'm late.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.342
My sandal broke.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.823
Mrs. Maivia, please...

05:45.867 --> 05:46.868
Ugh.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.304
Fine.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.393
Bring me back a steak.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.658
Okay, so, Dad,

05:54.702 --> 05:57.052
I was thinking we could go over
my thoughts on the match.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.183
What is that?

05:58.227 --> 06:00.055
Huh? Is that math?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.186
No math at the table.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.018
- I already know
what you're gonna order, Tony.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.890
both: Talapia.

06:08.933 --> 06:09.934
What's talapia?

06:09.978 --> 06:11.283
- Oh,
it's just a delicious fish

06:11.327 --> 06:12.633
I eat every chance I get.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.112
- Hey, when we go back
on the road,

06:14.156 --> 06:15.244
I'm gonna make you try tuna.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.028
- Back on the road?
- Yeah.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.508
Yeah, Vince is sending us
back out again

06:18.552 --> 06:20.118
- in a couple weeks.
- Yeah.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.206
Sorry, baby.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.338
That's the life.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.644
- Listen,
what people don't know...

06:23.687 --> 06:25.210
<i>- I hadn't expected</i>
<i>I'd have to compete</i>

06:25.254 --> 06:26.647
<i>for my dad's attention,</i>

06:26.690 --> 06:29.824
<i>and I was jealous.</i>

06:29.867 --> 06:32.130
- And it's a bony fish,
but once you get past that...

06:32.174 --> 06:34.306
And I'm like, "Am I crazy?

06:34.350 --> 06:35.482
All of these are just apples."

06:35.525 --> 06:36.657
Because once you try
a pedicure,

06:36.700 --> 06:37.919
there is no going back.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.877
I came to, I thought
I was on another planet.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.227
'Course I wasn't--I had just
passed out in the Grand Canyon.

06:42.271 --> 06:45.405
After about six weeks,
I realize, this ain't a kitten.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.015
It's a full-grown guinea pig.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.413
So what grade you in now,
little man?

06:53.456 --> 06:55.850
- I'm in the shut-up grade!

06:55.893 --> 06:57.417
- Wha--

06:59.941 --> 07:01.595
Dewey!

07:01.638 --> 07:02.900
- Dewey, no!

07:02.944 --> 07:04.554
- Nice technique, son!

07:04.598 --> 07:06.513
- Dewey, your muscles are
too strong!

07:06.556 --> 07:07.992
Excuse me?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.559
I don't mean
to disturb your dinner.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.692
I just wanted to say,
congrats, champs.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.737
- both: Thank you.
- Appreciate that.

07:13.781 --> 07:14.869
Want me to sign that for you?

07:14.912 --> 07:17.175
Oh, this is for Mr. Atlas.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.831
I have been a huge fan
of your bodybuilding career.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.529
You're a three-time
bodybuilding champion.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.269
- Well, thank you very much,
young lady.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.184
<i>- Turns out I wasn't</i>
<i>the only one who was jealous.</i>

07:26.228 --> 07:27.969
<i>My dad had everything</i>
<i>he wanted,</i>

07:28.012 --> 07:31.451
<i>but all he could see</i>
<i>was what he didn't have.</i>

07:31.494 --> 07:32.495
Tomahawk chop?

07:32.539 --> 07:33.714
Right here.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.197
Hey, you wanna get fish
at a steak place,

07:39.241 --> 07:40.938
that's your problem.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.027
- You didn't tell her
about talapia?

07:44.507 --> 07:44.681
.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.988
- So did jealousy
steal Rocky's joy right away

07:47.031 --> 07:49.077
or was he able to enjoy
his time on top?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.471
- No, he definitely enjoyed
his time on top.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.429
I mean,
he was so incredibly proud

07:53.473 --> 07:55.562
of what he and Tony Atlas
accomplished.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.564
They were the first
Black tag team champions

07:57.607 --> 07:58.913
in WWE history.

07:58.956 --> 07:59.957
How cool is that?

08:00.001 --> 08:01.263
That is very cool.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.699
I'm so sorry,
but I just have to say,

08:02.743 --> 08:04.222
that dough looks beautiful.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.834
- Ah, it's my famous
cheat-day biscuits

08:06.877 --> 08:08.618
from my cookbook...

08:08.662 --> 08:11.316
"Can You Cook
What the Rock is Cooking?"

08:11.360 --> 08:12.970
Stanley Tucci Award-winning.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.363
- That is quite an honor.
- It is an honor.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.712
- You know,
I love that cookbook.

08:15.756 --> 08:18.106
What I do is, I add butter
to all the recipes.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.195
- Wow, so your blood
is just like mayonnaise?

08:20.238 --> 08:21.457
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.503
- Yeah.
Anyway, did you feel

08:23.546 --> 08:25.243
that your dad having
a bigger platform

08:25.287 --> 08:26.810
made him less available to you?

08:26.854 --> 08:28.508
No, not in Hawaii.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.422
I mean, my dad was at the peak
of his career.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.294
We thought that that life was
gonna last forever,

08:32.337 --> 08:33.643
and, of course, it didn't.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.166
So a couple years later,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.429
he wasn't working
for the WWE anymore,

08:37.473 --> 08:39.214
and we couldn't pay the rent
and we were evicted

08:39.257 --> 08:41.346
out of our little apartment
in Hawaii.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.828
<i>- After we got kicked</i>
<i>off the island</i>

08:44.872 --> 08:47.352
<i>but before we went to live</i>
<i>in Pennsylvania,</i>

08:47.396 --> 08:49.180
<i>my dad found work</i>
<i>in Nashville.</i>

08:49.224 --> 08:51.618
<i>And my mom and I were going</i>
<i>to move there to join him.</i>

08:51.661 --> 08:52.749
<i>Dewey's landing</i>

08:52.793 --> 08:54.185
<i>on the 10:00 a.m. flight</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

08:54.229 --> 08:55.404
You take him to the apartment,

08:55.447 --> 08:56.579
get him enrolled in school.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.928
I'm gonna get the car
shipped to LA

08:57.972 --> 08:59.016
and then drive it to Nashville.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.149
- My baby driving my baby.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.063
How's the packing going?

09:02.106 --> 09:04.282
It's emotional, Rocky.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.545
We have a whole life here.

09:05.588 --> 09:06.807
I just don't know
what happened.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.331
- Babe, this is just a bump
in the road.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.202
I don't need the WWF
to be on top.

09:11.246 --> 09:14.205
People are loving me
in the Memphis territory.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.729
<i>Oh, hey, I gotta jet.</i>

09:15.772 --> 09:17.687
Jerry Lawler needs me
to cut a few promos.

09:17.731 --> 09:18.775
I love you.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.736
I love you.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.781
I'll think about it.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.218
I'll talk to you soon.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.611
Oh, and if you see
Linda Ronstadt--

09:28.655 --> 09:30.874
- Tell her to grow her hair
back out, I know.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.051
Oh, no, Dewey.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.618
Are you really gonna wear
those pants?

09:35.662 --> 09:38.621
<i>My god, I loved those pants.</i>

09:38.665 --> 09:41.189
If I have to leave Hawaii,
at least I can leave in style.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.712
- I know you're not thrilled
we're moving.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.236
I really think
Nashville's going to be great.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.587
Your dad said he's got
a nice apartment for us.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.197
I've heard there's a lot
of beautiful parks

09:49.240 --> 09:50.938
if you wanna...play frisbee.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.200
Frisbee?

09:52.243 --> 09:53.810
Nah, I can't sweat
in these pants.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.421
- Hey, don't talk like that
around the food.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.601
<i>- I hated that we were evicted</i>
<i>off the island,</i>

10:01.644 --> 10:03.646
<i>but at least in Nashville,</i>
<i>I was gonna get a chance</i>

10:03.690 --> 10:06.040
<i>to spend some one-on-one time</i>
<i>with my dad.</i>

10:12.873 --> 10:14.178
I'm Rocky Johnson's son.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.137
Hey. Bob Owens.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.617
Your dad asked me
to pick you up.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.358
Hey, you hungry?

10:20.402 --> 10:21.751
So...

10:21.795 --> 10:23.666
I'm what we call
in the business a carpenter.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.408
I go in,
build the baby faces up,

10:26.451 --> 10:30.281
get in a few punches,
and then I lose with gusto.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.196
I am undefeated at losing.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.807
I like your positivity, Bob.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.548
But my question is,
where's my dad?

10:41.423 --> 10:43.077
So my dad's staying here?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.340
- He said to drop you off
at room 117.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.342
I remember 'cause, uh...

10:47.385 --> 10:50.693
that was
my ex-girlfriend's weight.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.610
Oh, hey.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.961
Here you go. Little present.

10:58.005 --> 10:58.919
Tell your friends.

11:03.053 --> 11:06.317
- Dad?

11:06.361 --> 11:09.843
- Hey, young Dewey!
Long time no see.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.105
- Bruno?

11:11.148 --> 11:13.629
- Wait, who is this man
in the motel room?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.413
- That was my buddy,
Downtown Bruno.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.806
He was an old family friend,

11:16.850 --> 11:18.503
and I met him
when I was a kid in Hawaii.

11:18.547 --> 11:19.809
But at that time,
he was working

11:19.853 --> 11:22.116
as a heel manager
for Jerry "The King" Lawler.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.381
Damn.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.425
You grew up fast.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.383
How old are you now?

11:28.426 --> 11:29.950
Just turned 15.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.995
- Everyone always ends up
taller than Bruno.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.519
Get your butt in here, man.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.391
- So you had no idea
where your dad was?

11:36.434 --> 11:39.699
It was a different time.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.744
Nowadays, we know
exactly where our kids are

11:41.788 --> 11:43.703
every second of the day,
but back then,

11:43.746 --> 11:45.835
no one knew where anyone was,
and we were all good with it.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.010
Yeah, that's true.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.577
I once got lost in Mexico
for ten days,

11:48.620 --> 11:50.492
and my parents thought
I was in my bedroom.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.233
- See? Simpler times.
- Mm-hmm.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.234
I was four years old.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.322
Yeah.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.540
And where was Rocky?

11:55.584 --> 11:56.846
- Rocky's gonna meet us
in a bit.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.065
Okay.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.284
You hungry?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.244
I'm kind of a big deal
around here.

12:03.287 --> 12:04.549
I'm on Jerry Lawler's
wrestling show.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.116
Airs on the TV every Saturday.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.902
- Hey, Downtown Bruno.
Up yours!

12:08.945 --> 12:10.381
Let me tell you something.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.731
You wouldn't even know
what to do up there, brother.

12:11.774 --> 12:12.993
Hm.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.082
I'm kinda like the Tom Cruise
of Memphis.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.040
- We must've seen different
Tom Cruise movies, man.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.216
Could be, baby.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.652
Could be.
I'll tell you one thing.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.045
It's a risky business
out there.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.133
Well, there he is!

12:23.177 --> 12:24.265
- Mm.
- Dad.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.049
- Ah, get in here.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.269
Oh, you looking good, son.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.618
Hey, nice pants.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.272
<i>Loved those pants.</i>

12:31.315 --> 12:32.882
- Oh, excellent pants,
brother.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.101
Hey, Bruno?

12:34.144 --> 12:36.843
- You should, uh...
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

12:36.886 --> 12:38.192
You got it, Hoss.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.584
- You know,
Bruno is a heel, so...

12:39.628 --> 12:41.108
- Can't be seen
in public together.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.110
- For sure.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.416
Hey, sorry I couldn't
pick you up at the airport.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.288
Was in Tupelo wrestling
at the fairgrounds.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.769
Boy, I was over, big.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.596
- Bruno been treating you okay?
- Yeah, it's all good.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.772
I left my stuff at his place,

12:52.815 --> 12:54.121
so we can swing by
and get it later--

12:54.164 --> 12:56.340
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No need. No need.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.602
Actually you're gonna be
staying there

12:57.646 --> 12:58.908
for a bit
while I'm on the road.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.692
What?

13:00.736 --> 13:02.085
Mom said you got us
an apartment.

13:02.129 --> 13:05.523
Well, here's the thing.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.655
I didn't do that.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.178
But I will.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.485
I've just been so busy
with all these shows, you know?

13:10.528 --> 13:12.487
Demand for the Soul Man is hot,

13:12.530 --> 13:14.532
and I love to give the people
what they want.

13:14.576 --> 13:17.231
- For sure, but I'm supposed
to call Mom later.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.188
What am I gonna tell her?

13:18.232 --> 13:19.537
The truth.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.801
You landed safely,
we're together,

13:21.844 --> 13:23.846
and we can't wait to see her
in a couple of weeks.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.242
Aw, son,
ain't no need to worry her.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.809
I got everything under control.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.333
Okay?

13:32.376 --> 13:33.682
Okay.

13:33.725 --> 13:34.552
Yeah.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.598
- That's my boy.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.469
<i>- Turns out</i>
<i>that spending time with me</i>

13:38.513 --> 13:40.645
<i>wasn't my dad's</i>
<i>first priority.</i>

13:40.689 --> 13:43.170
- So what exactly
was Rocky's plan?

13:43.213 --> 13:45.215
- Well, same as always.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.477
Just make it to the next match,

13:46.521 --> 13:48.044
and somehow,
he could spin it enough

13:48.088 --> 13:49.916
where it would all just kinda
work itself out.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.918
- That must've been hard,
all that instability.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.137
- Yeah, I mean,
in retrospect, it was.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.749
- Can you not breathe
on the radishes like that?

13:57.793 --> 13:59.795
- All right,
if you want dirty-ass radishes.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.231
- It's fine. No, it's fine.
- I don't want filthy radishes.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.493
I just don't want you breathing
on them like that.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.017
- All right,
they're your radishes.

14:05.627 --> 14:05.975
.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.543
- Look, it was really hard
growing up, but...

14:08.586 --> 14:10.762
you know, as a kid, I didn't
know anything different.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.200
Me and my mom followed my dad
all around the world

14:13.243 --> 14:15.419
while he chased that dollar.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.247
And I wound up doing
the exact same thing.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.901
- Mm.
- Like when I went up to Canada

14:18.945 --> 14:20.772
and played in the CFL.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.078
Calgary Stampeders.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.341
- Stampeders.

14:25.603 --> 14:26.691
- I--sorry, I forgot.
- Come on.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.041
I forgot, I forgot.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.216
<i>- After not hearing</i>
<i>my name called</i>

14:29.259 --> 14:31.609
<i>in the 1995 NFL draft,</i>

14:31.653 --> 14:34.525
<i>I was signed</i>
<i>by the Calgary Stampeders.</i>

14:34.569 --> 14:35.831
<i>The Stamps, man.</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:37.572
<i>They were the best in the CFL</i>

14:37.615 --> 14:39.791
<i>and they had already won</i>
<i>three straight titles.</i>

14:39.835 --> 14:41.793
<i>And up there,</i>
<i>they call it the Grey Cup.</i>

14:41.837 --> 14:44.144
<i>My plan was to destroy it</i>
<i>in Canada</i>

14:44.187 --> 14:46.233
<i>and then get signed</i>
<i>by an NFL team.</i>

14:46.276 --> 14:48.061
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>I came into Calgary</i>

14:48.104 --> 14:49.671
<i>the only way I knew how:</i>

14:49.714 --> 14:51.064
<i>with that Miami swagger.</i>

14:51.107 --> 14:52.761
- As one of the newest members
of the Stampeders,

14:52.804 --> 14:54.458
is there anything you'd like
to say to the fans?

14:54.502 --> 14:55.938
We're going undefeated, baby.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.679
18 and 0.
Whoo!

15:01.465 --> 15:02.945
18...

15:02.989 --> 15:04.512
And 0.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.644
- Trash collection's
on Thursday.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.647
You'll be sharing this place
with three of your teammates.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.780
- Where's the furniture?
- At the store.

15:11.823 --> 15:12.824
If you're on a budget

15:12.868 --> 15:13.956
and you're looking
for a deal...

15:14.000 --> 15:15.827
This sex motel throws out
their mattresses

15:15.871 --> 15:17.220
once a quarter.

15:17.264 --> 15:20.702
- Uh, I guess I'll take
the least yellow one.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.921
Excellent choice.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.673
How did that not help?

15:35.717 --> 15:39.025
<i>- Wait, you said 18 and 0</i>
<i>in the interview?</i>

15:39.068 --> 15:40.374
Now, that's my boy!

15:40.417 --> 15:42.115
Come in strong
and announce yourself.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.333
Oh, I let 'em know, Dad.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.856
- Talk big.
- Play big.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.689
Hi, honey.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.517
I don't want to interrupt
your barking with your father,

15:53.561 --> 15:55.606
but did you get those American
cheese slices I packed?

15:55.650 --> 15:57.304
<i>I bet they cost a fortune</i>
<i>up there.</i>

15:57.347 --> 15:59.393
- I did, Mom. Thank you.
They tasted delicious.

15:59.436 --> 16:02.309
- Are they covering
the O.J. Simpson case up there?

16:02.352 --> 16:04.659
He's a football player,
and he is innocent.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.531
The FBIs, they don't know
what they're doing.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.011
<i>- And on my first day</i>
<i>of training camp,</i>

16:09.055 --> 16:12.101
<i>I learned that the CFL had</i>
<i>a different energy</i>

16:12.145 --> 16:13.842
<i>from what I was used to</i>
<i>at Miami.</i>

16:13.885 --> 16:15.235
Hey, what's up, fellas?

16:24.896 --> 16:27.029
You got some nerve, rook.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.727
18 and 0.

16:29.771 --> 16:30.815
Disgusting.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.556
- Hey,
I put the league on notice.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.906
- Look, we're not just
football players here, Dwayne.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.825
We got longstanding ties
with the community.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.872
Most of the guys even have
second jobs.

16:43.915 --> 16:47.876
- I hate taking this energy
into the station.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.051
Hey.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.357
You okay to get your mail here?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.402
Makes my job easier.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.838
- And then he hung up
his mail bag

16:53.882 --> 16:55.231
and started putting on pads.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.364
- Okay,
that's definitely weird.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.409
But it's
a different culture out there.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.715
I mean, look at Rick Moranis.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.934
- He's Canadian?
- He's so Canadian.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.415
- Wait, wait, wait,
you had a girlfriend?

17:05.459 --> 17:07.765
- Yeah, Dany and I
had been dating a while.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.419
We met at the U,
in the weight room.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.986
She was on the crew team.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.163
She was the most driven person
I had ever met.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.947
She always knew
what she wanted to be.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.079
- A boss.
- Mm.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.472
- Same, girl.
- Right?

17:18.515 --> 17:19.864
- How come you never
mentioned her before?

17:19.908 --> 17:21.083
Well, you never asked.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.432
- I didn't want
to get too personal.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.130
- That's why we're here,
brother--get personal.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.261
- How are things
in the bedroom?

17:25.305 --> 17:26.393
- That's too far.
- Yeah, I felt that.

17:26.436 --> 17:29.700
- Mm-hmm.
Anyway, Dany...was a badass.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.271
- And you know who else
is Canadian?

17:35.315 --> 17:36.968
- John Candy.
- King Ralph?

17:37.012 --> 17:38.318
<i>No, that's John Goodman.</i>

17:38.361 --> 17:39.623
- Oh.
<i>- I gotta run.</i>

17:39.667 --> 17:40.929
Remember...

17:40.972 --> 17:43.714
everyone in that building
can see your talent,

17:43.758 --> 17:45.368
so go shine.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.891
It's time to ball out.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.113
Hut!

17:53.724 --> 17:56.118
<i>- But balling out was</i>
<i>a lot easier said than done.</i>

17:56.162 --> 17:57.685
<i>The CFL was a different game,</i>

17:57.728 --> 17:59.121
<i>and it had different rules.</i>

18:00.514 --> 18:02.472
Johnson, you're offside!

18:02.516 --> 18:04.648
- I'm not!
- You are!

18:04.692 --> 18:06.911
- I am?
<i>I was offsides.</i>

18:06.955 --> 18:08.652
<i>I was always offsides.</i>

18:08.696 --> 18:10.698
<i>The D-line lined up</i>
<i>a yard off the ball.</i>

18:10.741 --> 18:11.699
Yeah!

18:11.742 --> 18:13.135
Great job, guys!

18:13.179 --> 18:15.137
Johnson, get off the field!

18:15.181 --> 18:16.791
- I am!
- You're not!

18:16.834 --> 18:17.922
I'm not?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.359
<i>The field was wider.</i>

18:19.402 --> 18:21.317
Why didn't you say something?

18:21.361 --> 18:22.666
You just left me out here?

18:22.710 --> 18:25.452
Coach! 12 men on the field.
That's a penalty!

18:25.495 --> 18:27.018
- It's not!
- It's not?

18:27.062 --> 18:29.108
<i>They had 12 players</i>
<i>instead of 11</i>

18:29.151 --> 18:30.631
<i>on each side of the ball.</i>

18:30.674 --> 18:32.850
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Well, that's just the CFL way.</i>

18:32.894 --> 18:35.157
<i>And all I knew,</i>
<i>I was catching on a lot slower</i>

18:35.201 --> 18:36.158
<i>than I thought I would.</i>

18:36.202 --> 18:37.203
What the hell is this?

18:37.246 --> 18:38.508
Canada!

18:38.552 --> 18:41.642
- Son,
you didn't make the team.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.035
But we see your potential.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.950
So we're putting you
on the practice squad.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.691
You don't play in the games,

18:47.735 --> 18:49.215
but you keep practicing
with the team,

18:49.258 --> 18:52.783
and if you do well, you can get
back onto the main squad.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.481
Okay.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.525
Then that's what I'll do.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.136
Now, practice squad does mean

18:57.179 --> 18:58.180
you'll be making less money.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.964
- That's fine.
Totally fine.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.140
How much less?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.750
- League minimum
for first team guys

19:02.793 --> 19:03.968
- is 55
- K a year.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.623
Practice-squad guys
get 350 a week.

19:06.667 --> 19:07.929
Dollars?

19:07.972 --> 19:09.452
- Loonies.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.715
Practice squad?

19:11.759 --> 19:12.847
Yeah.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.981
<i>So what do you wanna do?</i>

19:17.025 --> 19:20.246
- I want to stay here,
ball out on the practice squad,

19:20.289 --> 19:22.900
make the team, kick ass,
and get to the NFL.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.512
Okay.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.861
Then that's what you'll do.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.734
- That was it?
- That was it.

19:30.778 --> 19:34.173
- So you didn't try to spin it
or work the gimmick?

19:34.216 --> 19:36.305
- No, I could see
why you would think that.

19:36.349 --> 19:39.395
Growing up, it was always
look for the next place,

19:39.439 --> 19:41.223
the next job,
and if that didn't work out,

19:41.267 --> 19:42.485
then we would spin it.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.661
We'd survive, and we'd go on.

19:44.705 --> 19:48.012
I met Dany
when I was 18 years old,

19:48.056 --> 19:52.278
and at that time, I had
no real stability in my life.

19:52.321 --> 19:56.369
But she made me realize
that maybe...

19:56.412 --> 19:58.284
there's a different way.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.634
No spin. No gimmicks.

20:00.677 --> 20:01.896
Wow.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.419
I feel like I'm witnessing
your transition

20:03.463 --> 20:04.420
from boy to man.

20:05.552 --> 20:06.901
That's my "Mowtownphilly."

20:06.944 --> 20:08.119
Your "End Of The Road."

20:08.163 --> 20:09.425
both: Hey!

20:09.469 --> 20:10.731
Boyz II Men, baby.

20:16.389 --> 20:19.827
and leave me?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.615
That's good.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.617
- I think that's good. Yeah.
- Okay.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.184
- That was great.
- Yeah, thanks.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.012
- Look, obviously,
that was many, many years ago,

20:31.055 --> 20:33.493
but it's one of the reasons
why I still value stability

20:33.536 --> 20:37.279
these days, as a leader,
as a partner,

20:37.323 --> 20:40.978
and as a parent, which is why
I still sing "Desperado"

20:41.022 --> 20:43.720
into my phone every week
and I send it to my daughters.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.331
It's a little thing,
but it lets them know

20:45.374 --> 20:46.810
that I'm always thinking
about them.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.291
- We give what we didn't get.
- That's right.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.250
Just like
when your parents see this,

20:51.293 --> 20:53.556
they're gonna be horrified
that you were lost in Mexico.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.125
- Oh, no, they never watch
anything I'm in.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.823
Anyway, thank you
for being so open, Dwayne.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.825
I look forward
to the next few weeks

21:01.869 --> 21:03.436
and us really getting
to know the man

21:03.479 --> 21:05.264
who is going to be
in the White House.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.265
We'll see.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.310
Knock on wood.

21:25.936 --> 21:26.981
<i>I think that's a good idea.</i>
