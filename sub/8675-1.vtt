02:52.047 --> 02:53.924
Come on, Doc.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.931
- You gotta stay down here.
- Yeah.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.643
Check this out.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.189
Prints right here.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.817
<i>Reporting live from the home...</i>

03:12.025 --> 03:13.360
...of Dr. Richard Kimble...

03:13.568 --> 03:16.613
...a prominent surgeon
at Chicago Memorial Hospital.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.115
Details are sketchy...

03:18.323 --> 03:22.828
...but we know that Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered tonight.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.872
Area 6 detectives are bringing
Dr. Kimble out.

03:26.081 --> 03:30.419
We assume they will take him
to the Area 6 police station...

03:30.627 --> 03:35.298
...where they hope he can shed some light
on what happened tonight.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.301
As I indicated,
she was found shortly before midnight.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.471
We know that she made a 911 call to police...

03:41.680 --> 03:45.475
...indicating that there was an intruder
or that she was being assaulted.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.060
Details are very sketchy.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.479
We know that he and his wife, Helen...

03:49.688 --> 03:52.732
...were at the Four Seasons Hotel
earlier tonight...

03:52.941 --> 03:55.694
...at a fundraiser
for the Childrens' Research Fund.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.491
– Hey.
– Rich, remember Cara?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.034
– Nice to see you.
– Nice to see you.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.172
Straighten that arm. You'll slice.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.882
Golf pro teach you that?

04:17.214 --> 04:18.550
My wife.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.096
Before I forget...

04:23.305 --> 04:25.557
...thanks for the loaner. Keys are downstairs.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.685
– Any gas in it?
– Yes. Enough.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.562
Alec, Richard Kimble.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.773
– How are you?
– Dr. Kimble.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.858
– Guess that works too.
– Absolutely.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.860
– Anytime.
– Oh, yeah.

04:38.862 --> 04:42.449
I think that's a great idea,
getting the guys to try that project.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.992
All right, knock it off.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.328
There's nothing to see here.
You, come with me.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.996
Excuse me.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.874
Thank you. I was down to my last joke.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.221
<i>You look really beautiful tonight.</i>

05:05.805 --> 05:07.057
Thanks, honey.

05:07.641 --> 05:11.645
I know you hate these things,
but I love looking at you in a tux.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.065
I feel I look like a waiter.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.948
<i>- – Hello?
- Dr. Kimble?</i>

05:23.156 --> 05:25.200
<i>– Yes, it is.
– Sorry to bother you...</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:28.912
<i>...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency OR
and asked if you could give him a hand.</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:33.208
Call him and say I'll be right there.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.751
<i>– Thank you, doctor.
– Yup.</i>

05:34.960 --> 05:36.670
Thank you. Good night.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.423
I'll wait up for you.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.093
<i>I'll wait up for you.</i>

06:10.954 --> 06:13.081
<i>Talk to me. What do we got here?</i>

06:13.290 --> 06:14.791
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:19.296
A 58-year-old. Just pulled his gallbladder.
Bleeding.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.506
Big time. It's in the liver bed.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.842
What are his coags?
– They're all messed up.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.428
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.096
Where'd he come from?

06:28.305 --> 06:31.683
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.811
Let me in there. Give me some room.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.814
Give me a clamp.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.441
Give me suction.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.277
<i>Have you been getting
any threats at work?</i>

06:42.485 --> 06:45.238
Co-workers, hospital staff,
anything like that at all?

06:45.822 --> 06:46.948
Uh...

06:47.157 --> 06:50.118
– No.
– Anything unusual going on...

06:50.327 --> 06:52.704
...as far as phone calls, people hanging up?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.165
People coming to the door?

06:55.457 --> 06:56.499
Tradespeople?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.501
Not that I know of.

06:58.835 --> 07:02.756
Back on this fight
with this guy with the one arm.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.592
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?

07:06.343 --> 07:07.636
– Upstairs.
– Uh-huh.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.513
And he had which? A right or a left arm?

07:11.848 --> 07:13.850
With a gimmick on it?

07:14.684 --> 07:15.810
Right arm.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.271
Is it one of those with the hooks, or-

07:18.480 --> 07:20.482
No, he had, like, a-

07:20.690 --> 07:22.567
He had a cosmetic hand.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.279
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good one.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.115
Anyone have the coding
besides you and your wife?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.701
Our maid.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.537
She knows the code and has a key.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.624
Those scratches on your neck...

07:38.625 --> 07:40.877
...did the one-armed guy do that?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.506
Helen scratched me when I moved her.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.801
Before or after the fight
with the one-armed guy?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.387
I told you.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.972
You own a gun?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.141
Do you own a gun?

07:56.893 --> 07:58.895
Yes, we have one in the house.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.480
It's in your name?

08:00.689 --> 08:01.731
Yes.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.984
Where do you usually keep that gun?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.027
The one that you own.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.071
It's in Helen's table.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.240
Bedside table.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.993
Do you keep much jewelry in the house?

08:13.201 --> 08:14.494
Uno.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.997
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...

08:18.331 --> 08:20.375
...the gun and the bullets...

08:20.583 --> 08:23.920
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.424
Your wife's got the money in the family,
hasn't she?

08:28.133 --> 08:31.344
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.179
Is she insured?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.183
Yes, she is.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.602
Who's the beneficiary?

08:42.856 --> 08:46.067
– I am.
– The sole beneficiary?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.194
Yes.

08:49.112 --> 08:52.282
Financially,
you won't be hurting after this, will you?

08:53.783 --> 08:55.785
She was worth a lot of money.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.124
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?

09:01.958 --> 09:06.045
Are you saying that I crushed her skull
and shot her?

09:07.297 --> 09:09.049
How dare you!

09:09.632 --> 09:12.302
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.179
– I fought with him.
– Uh-huh.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.223
– The one-armed man.
– He had a mechanical arm.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.809
– Plastic? Rubber?
– Find this man!

09:20.018 --> 09:21.728
You find this man!

09:22.645 --> 09:23.688
How tall?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.607
He took everything from me.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.108
Oh, Jesus.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.777
What did he weigh?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.487
What color was his hair?

09:31.154 --> 09:33.072
What color were his eyes?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.995
We can't help you if you don't help us.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.789
Book him.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.707
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

09:42.916 --> 09:47.253
...you will hear iron-clad proof
of Richard Kimble's guilt.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.883
Indisputable scientific evidence...

09:52.092 --> 09:54.636
...that on the night of January 20...

09:54.844 --> 09:57.347
...Richard Kimble did viciously...

10:00.517 --> 10:01.851
...attack...

10:02.602 --> 10:04.562
...and brutally murder his wife.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.441
You'll hear more than that.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.611
You will hear a voice from the grave.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.114
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...

10:16.116 --> 10:18.535
...her husband, Richard Kimble.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.287
Detective Kelly...

10:21.496 --> 10:25.792
...tell us what you saw at the victim's home
on the night of the murder.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.669
No forcible entry was found.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.508
<i>From the beginning of the investigation,
it didn't appear to be a break-in.</i>

10:33.716 --> 10:35.218
<i>Nothing was missing.</i>

10:38.388 --> 10:39.430
I'm home.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.058
Who won the game?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.853
His prints were on the gun and bullets.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.897
<i>No other sets were found,
other than the housekeeper's...</i>

10:48.106 --> 10:49.482
<i>...and the deceased's.</i>

10:52.026 --> 10:56.573
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.159
It took less than 5 minutes for her to die.

11:16.009 --> 11:20.013
Your Honor, we'd ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

11:20.221 --> 11:24.100
...previously identified
by the Chicago Police Dispatcher.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.312
<i>Emergency 911.</i>

11:27.520 --> 11:29.105
Please help me.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.317
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

11:33.693 --> 11:37.071
<i>He's here still, in the house.</i>

11:37.280 --> 11:38.907
<i>Did I hear you right?</i>

11:39.115 --> 11:40.158
<i>Someone's in your house?</i>

11:42.619 --> 11:44.621
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

11:44.871 --> 11:46.623
<i>Could you repeat that?</i>

11:48.374 --> 11:49.542
<i>Ma'am?</i>

11:50.126 --> 11:52.545
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

11:52.879 --> 11:54.923
<i>Ma'am?</i>

11:55.131 --> 11:57.800
<i>Is your attacker still in the house?</i>

12:03.473 --> 12:05.892
<i>- Richard...
- Ma'am?</i>

12:06.100 --> 12:07.477
Richard...

12:09.646 --> 12:11.814
He's trying to kill me.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.200
Mr. Kimble...

12:22.408 --> 12:26.537
...having considered all the aggravation
and mitigation in this case...

12:26.746 --> 12:31.501
...and found the offense was brutal
and indicative of wanton cruelty...

12:31.918 --> 12:36.464
...it's this court's judgment that you be
remanded to Illinois State Penitentiary...

12:36.673 --> 12:40.510
...where you will await
execution by lethal injection...

12:41.010 --> 12:44.931
...on a date to be set forth
by the attorney general of this state.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.684
May God have mercy on your soul.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.253
- Carlson.
- Here.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.005
- Partida.
- Yeah.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.715
Copeland.
– What?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.217
You be nice now.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.386
Kimble.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.222
Yeah.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.146
Let's go, gentlemen.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.648
Four prisoners conning out.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.694
<i>Prisoners coming up.</i>

13:58.171 --> 13:59.672
Let's go, gentlemen.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.594
Kimble, you're here.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.098
Carlson, right over there.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.351
Partida, up front left.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.604
Copeland, you're back here with me.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.442
Make yourselves comfortable.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.029
You know the routine, gentlemen.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.309
I'm tired.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.399
Twenty miles from Menard.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.317
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.

15:02.735 --> 15:06.739
I'll be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie take care of them.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.785
I hope he's got something
good to eat there. I'm starving.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.412
Me too.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.082
Had enough prison chow.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.588
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.215
Right, Ed?

15:35.476 --> 15:36.686
Get in here, quick!

15:39.522 --> 15:41.441
He's getting sick! Move!

15:41.732 --> 15:44.235
- – He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.820
He's choking!

15:48.573 --> 15:50.074
Wait!

15:55.163 --> 15:56.831
Ah!

16:46.339 --> 16:47.840
Oh, shit!

16:49.926 --> 16:51.052
Kimble!

16:51.260 --> 16:53.888
Get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!

16:54.096 --> 16:56.933
Unlock me. Unlock me!

16:58.809 --> 17:00.144
Here.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.355
You'll be okay.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.945
What the hell is that?

17:14.450 --> 17:15.617
Shit!
– Ah!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.164
Give me a hand with this man.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.832
The hell with you.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.751
Copeland, help me with this man!

17:24.961 --> 17:26.753
Kiss my ass, Doc.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.271
Listen...

19:50.022 --> 19:52.525
I don't care which way you go.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.027
Just don't follow me. Got that?

19:55.361 --> 19:56.487
Yeah.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.406
Hey, Copeland.

19:59.782 --> 20:00.866
Be good.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.534
My, my, my, my.
What a mess.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.453
It's a circus.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.041
You got my bag?

20:53.127 --> 20:54.962
Point of impact right here.

20:57.298 --> 21:00.384
The first engine uncoupled,
the rest of the train jumped the track.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.136
– About 100 yards?
– Yeah.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.762
You must get new boots.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.431
I told you not to wear the heels.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.932
I want you to wear two coats.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.434
Next train wreck.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.144
Why do we always mother her?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.395
Because she loves us.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.566
- How'd you like to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.318
Hold it, sir.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.861
Who's in charge?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.905
– Sheriff Rawlins.
– Rawlins.

21:21.155 --> 21:24.033
– Just follow the TV lights.
– Good, good.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.534
Sheriff Rogers.

21:25.743 --> 21:26.827
Rawlins.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.627
- – Look down there and take Newman.
- Right.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.837
Time to go to work.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.801
The bus rolled over several times
before settling down the hill.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.220
I don't know if I passed out...

21:44.428 --> 21:48.432
...but when I looked up,
the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.852
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.648
I grabbed him and pushed him
out of the bus.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.901
– You're brave, you could've been killed.
– I know.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.612
He's my partner.
He'd have done the same for me.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.574
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal
Samuel Gerard, I'd like to-

22:05.783 --> 22:09.703
– I'll be with you in a minute.
– Okay.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.372
Again, just for the record...

22:11.580 --> 22:13.666
– ... these three are dead?
– Yeah.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.126
And this one?

22:16.961 --> 22:19.296
Everything happened so fast.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.383
I don't think he made it.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.970
You came a long way for nothing.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.180
With all due respect, sheriff...

22:28.389 --> 22:31.100
...I'd like to recommend checkpoints
on a 15-mile radius...

22:31.308 --> 22:33.310
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route-

22:33.519 --> 22:35.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.606
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

22:37.815 --> 22:42.444
Checkpoints will get people frantic
and they'll flood my office with calls.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.114
Shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

22:45.322 --> 22:48.075
...so I'll take over your investigation.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.119
You just...

22:50.327 --> 22:51.662
On what authority?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.289
The Governor...

22:53.497 --> 22:55.207
...the U.S. Marshal's office...

22:55.416 --> 22:57.001
...5th District, Northern Illinois.

22:58.168 --> 23:02.339
All right, you want jurisdiction over this mess,
you got it.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.633
Okay, boys, gather around and listen.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.511
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp's here to mop up-

23:07.720 --> 23:10.139
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.267
– Sam.
– Oh, wow, gee whiz. Look here!

23:17.271 --> 23:21.400
We're always fascinated when we find
leg irons with no legs in them.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.403
– Who held the key, sir?
– Me.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.946
Where are they?

23:26.530 --> 23:27.573
I don't know.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.826
– Care to revise your statement, sir?
– What?

23:31.035 --> 23:33.621
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.376
– He might've got out.
– He might've got out.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.920
You said he was part of the wreckage!

23:42.129 --> 23:45.007
Set up operations by the fire truck.
Listen, everyone!

23:45.215 --> 23:48.010
A fugitive has been on the run
for 90 minutes.

23:48.218 --> 23:52.348
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is four miles an hour.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.683
That gives us a radius of six miles.

23:57.811 --> 24:02.358
What I want from each of you
is a hard target search of every gas station...

24:03.567 --> 24:06.945
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...

24:07.154 --> 24:08.822
...and doghouse in that area.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.575
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

24:13.243 --> 24:16.622
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.251
Go get him.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.619
Don't give me shit.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.622
I got three very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.791
Stevens, it's Cosmo.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.711
I'll have a satellite telephone
hook up in two seconds.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.422
Police just found a blood trail...

25:48.672 --> 25:50.632
– ... two miles southwest.
– Robert.

25:50.841 --> 25:53.177
Yo.
– Match that blood against the prisoners'.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.595
– Right.
– Renfro.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.056
– Yo.
– Get a fax I.D. on Kimble...

25:57.264 --> 25:58.807
...to every local hospital.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.018
Follow that with troopers.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.937
Newman.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.939
– Yes.
– What are you doing?

26:06.440 --> 26:07.733
I'm thinking.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.570
Think me up some coffee and a doughnut
with sprinkles on top...

26:11.779 --> 26:13.113
...as long as you're thinking.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.240
We got a live body!

26:15.449 --> 26:16.909
A live one?

26:22.122 --> 26:25.584
Hang in there, brother.
We'll get you out of here.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.004
- Got it?
- I got it. All right

26:29.213 --> 26:31.465
Get that ambulance down here!

27:38.031 --> 27:39.867
Is this what you want?

27:40.450 --> 27:41.743
That's it.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.537
I'll make copies.

28:07.311 --> 28:11.648
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.610
We're thirsty today, aren't we?

28:14.818 --> 28:17.154
Eat up before it gets cold.

28:21.992 --> 28:25.329
It really gets dry in here, doesn't it?

28:30.083 --> 28:31.585
Here you are.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.629
Now, eat something.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.589
You need your strength.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.508
Shit.

29:21.551 --> 29:25.931
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. Might be hurt.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.683
What does he look like?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.560
Six-one, 180, brown hair, brown eyes, beard.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.437
Seen anyone like that around?

29:32.646 --> 29:34.648
Every time I look in the mirror.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.650
Except for the beard, of course.

29:36.858 --> 29:37.901
Doc!

29:38.777 --> 29:40.362
Yeah?

29:44.491 --> 29:45.659
Thanks.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.092
- – I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, doc.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.302
It's...

30:05.762 --> 30:06.805
How is he?

30:07.014 --> 30:09.766
Good, considering we dug him out
from under a train.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.937
Tell the attending he's got a puncture
in the upper gastric area.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.898
How could he tell that
by looking at his face?

30:26.033 --> 30:28.618
Background just came in from Chicago.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.121
About time. What've we got?

30:31.621 --> 30:34.958
"Richard David Kimble, vascular surgeon. "
What's that?

30:35.208 --> 30:37.836
Somebody that makes more money than you.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.922
"Convicted of 1st-degree
murder of his wife.

30:41.131 --> 30:44.092
Pleaded innocent.
Says a one-armed man did it. "

30:44.301 --> 30:45.594
Lots of friends.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.138
Doctors, hospital staff.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.725
We'll start there. I want phone taps.
First, his lawyer.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.393
Whoa, you'll never get that.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.188
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want phone taps.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.981
Why are you yelling at me?

30:58.190 --> 31:00.192
I'll tell him on who later
if I'm in a good mood.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.860
– Why not yell at her sometimes?
– Sam.

31:02.069 --> 31:04.946
– What?
– We got a call from the hospital.

31:05.155 --> 31:07.783
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble there.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.034
That's hot.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.577
And an ambulance is missing.

31:11.078 --> 31:13.205
Where's he going in an ambulance?

31:28.261 --> 31:29.638
Sam!

31:31.306 --> 31:34.059
Sam, ambulance just spotted...

31:34.267 --> 31:38.480
...two miles west of Doverville,
heading north, State Highway 53.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.190
Running out of map!

31:53.954 --> 31:55.497
Get your maps out.

31:55.705 --> 31:58.375
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.591
I want to know all routes in and out of town.

32:19.229 --> 32:22.691
We're headed north on Route 13,
toward the Barkley Dam.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.025
Son of a bitch!

32:31.241 --> 32:33.076
Don't lose that ambulance.

32:44.880 --> 32:49.551
Visual location of an ambulance headed north
on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.761
We'll pass through a viaduct.

32:55.432 --> 32:59.144
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs
and Newman in from south of the viaduct.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.687
He's hauling ass.

33:06.276 --> 33:09.946
Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?

33:12.282 --> 33:14.951
Look on your map to know how to get there.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.396
We got him!

34:01.957 --> 34:03.625
Watch out! Watch out!

34:07.837 --> 34:10.090
– What's going on?
– Get back in your car, sir!

34:12.926 --> 34:15.262
Newman! Rock and roll!

34:24.603 --> 34:26.273
Put a light in there!

34:27.357 --> 34:28.692
Put a light in there!

34:28.900 --> 34:30.318
What do you got?

34:30.527 --> 34:32.237
I got nothing.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.322
– Talk to me. What do you got?
– You must be kidding me!

34:35.532 --> 34:38.159
– What-?
– You must be kidding me!

34:43.665 --> 34:46.793
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!

35:05.979 --> 35:07.606
We got a gopher.

35:21.911 --> 35:25.248
Shit! I just bought these shoes.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.334
Shut up, Cosmo.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.169
Which way, Sam?

36:55.338 --> 36:56.965
Ah!

37:16.693 --> 37:18.820
I didn't kill my wife!

37:19.779 --> 37:21.531
I don't care!

38:14.167 --> 38:15.585
Put that gun down!

38:17.754 --> 38:19.422
Put that gun down!

38:20.590 --> 38:21.758
Now!

38:23.051 --> 38:24.260
Hands up!

38:24.677 --> 38:25.720
Over your head!

38:26.596 --> 38:27.639
Turn around!

38:30.391 --> 38:31.893
Do you want to get shot?

38:38.107 --> 38:39.734
Pay attention!

38:39.943 --> 38:41.903
Get down on your knees!

38:42.111 --> 38:43.947
Right now!

39:02.006 --> 39:03.967
Sam!
– Yo.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.681
What happened? Where'd he go?

39:09.889 --> 39:12.350
He did a Peter Pan right off this dam!

39:12.559 --> 39:14.018
Right here!

39:14.227 --> 39:15.979
Down! Boom!

39:16.229 --> 39:18.106
Holy shit!

39:20.400 --> 39:21.442
Can we go home now?

39:21.651 --> 39:23.736
No. No.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.072
Holy shit!

39:31.911 --> 39:34.122
– There's no way out of here.
– Down that way.

39:34.497 --> 39:38.084
- Down that way.
- No, no. Go up. Go up!

39:38.293 --> 39:40.545
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

39:40.753 --> 39:43.631
Get them down here now.
Helicopters, divers!

39:47.051 --> 39:49.554
Have that water turned off. Come over here.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.891
Put two cars on that bridge down there
and four patrolmen.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.810
Have them glass this river
upstream and down.

39:56.019 --> 40:00.815
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this
river. Make him aware of these wires.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.984
Are you crazy? He's dead!

40:03.192 --> 40:05.153
That'll make him easy to catch.

40:05.361 --> 40:08.573
I want hounds on both banks of this
river for 2 miles...

40:08.781 --> 40:11.117
...upstream and downstream.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.787
– You've got a search-and-rescue team?
– Yeah, we do.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.874
Get them down here
and drag the bottom of this spillway.

40:18.374 --> 40:22.003
– Why isn't the water turned off?
– Somebody from County's working on it.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.340
Hurry it up. They're running out of daylight.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.002
No. Bring in the helicopter now.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.879
We're out of here!

41:05.088 --> 41:07.382
I don't think there's anything to find.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.635
Find it anyway.
You've got lights and generators coming.

41:36.869 --> 41:40.248
– I won't tell you how to do your job...
– Put the helicopter on the bridge!

41:40.456 --> 41:45.003
...but only one in a million could survive
that fall. He's fish food!

41:45.211 --> 41:47.964
Get a cane pole and catch
the fish that ate him.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.634
Get Stevens.
Tell him we're on the way in.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.237
<i>That man took everything from me.</i>

43:39.075 --> 43:40.660
We can't find the guy.

43:43.788 --> 43:45.331
<i>We can't find the guy.</i>

43:47.792 --> 43:50.127
<i>You find that man!</i>

43:58.135 --> 43:59.762
<i>You find that man!</i>

43:59.971 --> 44:01.472
<i>Find that man!</i>

44:06.894 --> 44:09.438
The generators
and searchlights are there now.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.108
They'll continue the search into the night.

44:12.316 --> 44:15.278
Good. Call Kentucky
and thank them for the dogs.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.614
Remember,
opera ain't over until the Big Dog howls.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.595
Need a ride?

45:42.323 --> 45:43.658
Check it again.

45:44.408 --> 45:47.954
All right, we got him.
He shacked up with some babe in Whiting.

45:48.162 --> 45:50.790
She left work tonight and took him home.

45:50.998 --> 45:55.544
– About 2 hours ago, her boss said.
– They spotted her car outside her house.

45:56.170 --> 45:57.797
Does she run with anyone?

45:58.005 --> 46:00.383
No one we could find. No family either.

46:00.591 --> 46:05.388
Tell the police not to move till we get there.
We'll go early in the morning.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.223
– Your cousin still got his truck?
– Mm-hm.

46:07.431 --> 46:08.849
Tell him we need it.

46:29.829 --> 46:31.706
– Be drunk, Newman.
– Yeah.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.292
Stay close.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.044
Right on your ass, bud.

46:44.301 --> 46:47.054
I don't want you getting lost.
Stick with me.

47:00.693 --> 47:02.611
U.S. Marshals! Everybody down!

47:08.075 --> 47:09.243
- – Ah!
- Hold it right there!

47:09.452 --> 47:11.245
Show me those hands!
Give me those hands.

47:15.499 --> 47:16.542
Keep them up!

47:21.672 --> 47:23.841
Get your ass in there.

47:24.175 --> 47:27.261
I got your man!
I got your man, you hear me?

47:28.929 --> 47:30.890
I want out of here!

47:31.098 --> 47:32.767
I got your man!

47:33.476 --> 47:34.935
I got your man!

47:35.770 --> 47:39.774
I'm going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!

47:40.691 --> 47:42.193
Do you hear me, cops?

47:42.693 --> 47:44.236
Do you hear me?

47:44.445 --> 47:45.946
I want out of here!

47:47.364 --> 47:50.326
- – Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.

47:50.868 --> 47:53.662
- – Shut up! Shut up!
- Listen to me.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.539
Do you hear me?

47:56.374 --> 47:59.001
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.045
I want a car out front.

48:05.007 --> 48:08.052
– Don't shoot.
– It's over.

48:30.324 --> 48:31.867
Shut up.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.612
I can't hear anything. My ears...

49:11.782 --> 49:13.450
I can't believe you did that.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.455
You think I should've bargained with him.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.083
Yeah.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.543
I do.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.879
You could've missed.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.548
– You could've killed me.
– Yeah.

49:30.050 --> 49:31.552
How bad is that ear?

49:32.219 --> 49:34.680
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.

49:34.889 --> 49:35.973
Let me see it.

49:36.390 --> 49:38.017
Come here.

49:38.559 --> 49:40.269
Can you hear me now?

49:40.811 --> 49:42.354
Yeah.

49:43.814 --> 49:45.482
I don't...

49:46.233 --> 49:47.860
...bargain.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.237
You hear that?

49:51.322 --> 49:52.740
Yeah.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.576
Good.

50:37.785 --> 50:39.495
Walter, this is Richard.

50:39.703 --> 50:43.791
<i>Jesus! Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.</i>

50:44.291 --> 50:46.669
I wasn't worried about appearances.

50:46.877 --> 50:50.172
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

50:50.381 --> 50:52.758
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

50:52.967 --> 50:58.347
Richard, you're asking me to aid
a convicted felon. I can't help you that way.

50:58.556 --> 51:02.601
<i>My advice as your friend and attorney
is to give yourself up.</i>

51:02.810 --> 51:05.062
<i>Now tell me, where are you?</i>

51:05.646 --> 51:07.064
St. Louis.

51:07.314 --> 51:10.150
<i>Give me an address.
I'll get there as soon as I can.</i>

51:15.906 --> 51:19.660
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.831
You can blame me. I'm the one that shot him.

51:30.629 --> 51:32.923
Raymonds, take care of that.

51:33.132 --> 51:34.800
<i>...give yourself up.</i>

51:35.009 --> 51:37.177
<i>Now tell me, where are you?</i>

51:37.386 --> 51:38.721
<i>St. Louis.</i>

51:38.929 --> 51:41.724
So he's not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.

51:41.932 --> 51:44.810
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.938
You been right before.

51:48.981 --> 51:50.232
All right.

51:50.441 --> 51:53.068
<i>- Walter, this is Richard.
- Richard, Jesus.</i>

51:53.485 --> 51:55.321
<i>Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.</i>

51:57.072 --> 51:58.616
<i>I wasn't worried about appearances.</i>

51:58.824 --> 52:02.286
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

52:02.536 --> 52:04.913
<i>I won't surrender. I need help, money.</i>

52:05.122 --> 52:07.583
That train sounds like an El.

52:07.791 --> 52:09.626
St. Louis doesn't have an elevated train.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.962
How do you know it's an elevated train?

52:12.338 --> 52:14.298
I lived under an El for 20 years.

52:14.506 --> 52:19.178
Explain the difference between the sound
of an El and a train on the ground.

52:19.386 --> 52:20.679
You must have ears
like an eagle.

52:20.888 --> 52:24.350
Play that back.
I want to hear the sound of an elevated train.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.894
What cities have Els? New York does.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.354
– Philly.
– We do.

52:28.562 --> 52:29.855
Milwaukee.

52:30.064 --> 52:33.359
Hold it right there where the lawyer says
he sounds guilty. There's bells.

52:33.567 --> 52:37.154
There's a guy on a P.A.
Can you drop everything but him?

52:37.363 --> 52:38.405
I'll try.

52:38.614 --> 52:39.656
Okay.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.743
<i>– Walter, this is Richard.
– Richard.</i>

52:42.993 --> 52:44.328
Right there.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.455
What's he saying?

52:46.664 --> 52:49.750
Sounds like, "Next stop. " Do that again!

52:52.795 --> 52:54.129
<i>– Next stop...
– "Next stop"...</i>

52:54.338 --> 52:57.091
<i>– ... Merchandise Mart.
– "Merchandise Mart. "</i>

52:57.299 --> 52:59.468
Son of a bitch. The boy came home.

52:59.927 --> 53:03.013
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
six blocks away.

53:04.348 --> 53:05.808
I knew it was an elevated train.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.352
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

53:08.602 --> 53:11.522
– I'll call the C.P.D.
– This is his Chicago file.

53:13.273 --> 53:15.818
When I die, I want to come back like you.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.152
Happy and handsome?

53:18.278 --> 53:19.738
- – I'll notify the press.
- No press.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.490
Right, no press.

53:25.452 --> 53:27.579
Chicago.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.261
– Hi, Billy.
– How's it going, sir?

53:42.469 --> 53:44.471
– Good, and you?
– All right.

53:48.016 --> 53:50.102
Here you go. See you.

54:04.074 --> 54:05.784
Spare change? Dollar, Mister?

54:05.993 --> 54:09.538
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.

54:09.747 --> 54:10.831
No, I...

54:12.583 --> 54:14.835
Oh, my God. Richard!

54:15.502 --> 54:16.795
How are you, Charlie?

54:17.004 --> 54:18.297
Jesus, you're back.

54:18.505 --> 54:19.548
I need money.

54:20.007 --> 54:21.300
Sure. Get in.

54:21.508 --> 54:24.052
No, I can't. Whatever you got on you.

54:24.261 --> 54:26.555
You're hot. If not now, you will be.

54:26.764 --> 54:29.683
Have you got a place to stay?
How can I help you?

54:31.560 --> 54:33.854
The light is green. Move!

54:34.062 --> 54:35.105
I'll call you.

54:36.732 --> 54:38.567
Yeah, but Rich-

54:46.033 --> 54:48.452
<i>Why did Kimble kill his wife?</i>

54:48.660 --> 54:49.870
For the money.

54:50.078 --> 54:52.748
For the money? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.208
She was more rich.

54:55.626 --> 54:58.253
– Is this the entire Chicago police file?
– Yeah.

54:58.462 --> 55:01.173
That's everything.
– I want to do all the interviews again.

55:01.882 --> 55:04.176
The list of hospital staff is there?

55:04.384 --> 55:06.220
– Sure is.
– Thank you.

55:06.428 --> 55:08.013
You don't want to use the media?

55:08.222 --> 55:12.893
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.

55:17.064 --> 55:19.191
Here's the apartment.

55:19.399 --> 55:22.611
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.

55:22.819 --> 55:25.030
Here is kitchen. Sink.

55:25.239 --> 55:28.075
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.

55:28.283 --> 55:29.868
Is nice bed.

55:30.077 --> 55:31.453
Plenty space.

55:31.662 --> 55:33.080
You can look at.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.230
You like the place?

55:58.438 --> 55:59.731
It's okay?

56:01.191 --> 56:02.526
It's perfect.

56:02.985 --> 56:04.319
All right, people.

56:04.528 --> 56:08.490
This morning we were notified
by the Marshal's office...

56:08.699 --> 56:13.370
...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble
is alive and well and back in Chicago.

56:14.538 --> 56:17.499
You know in what high regard
we hold this scumbag.

56:17.708 --> 56:21.003
I'm personally donating a bottle
of 12-year-old Scotch...

56:21.211 --> 56:23.380
...to whoever collars this quack.

56:23.630 --> 56:26.049
Dick Rosetti's passing out bulletins.

57:15.932 --> 57:18.393
– Gunshot wound to the left shoulder.
– What are his vitals?

57:18.602 --> 57:21.521
120 over 60. 98 pulse.

57:47.798 --> 57:48.924
Help you?

59:22.350 --> 59:23.810
You went to medical school together?

59:24.019 --> 59:25.479
Yes, we did.

59:26.146 --> 59:27.898
The class of '73.

59:29.316 --> 59:30.609
Do you know Morton Feinberg?

59:30.817 --> 59:32.694
– I do.
– He's a real nice guy.

59:33.653 --> 59:35.030
When did you see him last?

59:35.238 --> 59:36.531
– Who, Richard?
– Yeah.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.368
I saw Richard this morning.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.788
– What?
– This morning?

59:42.996 --> 59:45.123
He stopped my car. I gave him money.

59:45.332 --> 59:46.750
Uh-huh.

59:47.167 --> 59:48.293
Where was this?

59:49.086 --> 59:51.088
Outside my tennis club.

59:51.296 --> 59:52.339
Did he ask for help?

59:52.547 --> 59:55.675
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.

59:55.884 --> 59:57.260
How much did you give him?

59:57.469 --> 59:59.930
Oh, couple of bucks. What I had on me.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:03.266
– He won't get far on that.
– Why'd he come back to Chicago?

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:04.976
He didn't tell me.

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:09.439
I'm sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but...

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:16.154
Dr. Nichols. You really want
to be his friend and help him?

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.406
Help us bring him in unharmed.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.575
Why?

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.786
So he can go back to prison?

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:28.875
If you want help, gentlemen,
you've come to the wrong man.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.461
Richard is innocent.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.339
You'll never find him. He's too smart.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:37.300
– We're some smart guys.
– What about us?

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.678
– Last time I looked.
– We're smart. We are.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.222
How smart could he be, really?

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.099
Is he as smart as you?

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.060
Smarter.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.122
Peripheral vascular surgery.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.708
Fixing arteries as they come out of the heart.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.670
– How long have you known Richard Kimble?
– Ten years. Since I've been here.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:19.718
What kind of medicine did he practice
at the hospital?

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.993
I want you to know that I believe
Richard Kimble to be innocent.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.578
Would he seek your help?

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.872
If he did, I'd help him.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.999
But he wouldn't come to me.

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.459
That's not his style.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.561
<i>A warrant remains outstanding...</i>

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.147
<i>...for Chicago surgeon Richard Kimble.</i>

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:32.999
This is where the one-armed guy
and he struggled and fell down the stairs.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:40.173
I fell down these stairs, I'd be a goner.
I'd be dead.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.269
What a waste.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.446
<i>When I came home,
there was a man in my house.</i>

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:30.724
Richard.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.406
Police!

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.706
- Police. We're the police!
- Where is he?

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.425
Get him, get him!

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.094
Hold it!

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.810
– Freeze!
– Get down. Where you going?

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.482
It's over.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.446
You like stringing out 12-year-old girls?

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:28.323
What are you doing with my baby?

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.533
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.285
– What he-?
– Come on, ma'am.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.455
What they doing to my baby?

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.818
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.403
A lot of kids.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.572
They bring them all here?

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:11.616
All coming to County.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.972
– Hi.
– Hi, hi, hi.

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:38.226
– I've come to do those blinds.
– Okay.

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:39.894
I'll get the door.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:53.700
– I'll start in here, huh?
– Oh, okay.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.290
Let's go over it once more.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.376
What time did he arrive at the house?

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.836
About 10:30 in the morning.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.882
– He was alone?
– Yeah, he was alone.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.843
– You got a good look at him?
– Yeah, really good.

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:38.721
You better be straight with me.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.141
This is the guy
staying in your mother's basement?

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:44.269
That's what I'm telling you.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:02.120
- – Is she stable?
- Just barely.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.498
Just breathe, stay calm.
– I need a doctor over here!

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:14.132
Watch the bag! Watch the bag!

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:22.140
Call vascular and ortho
and call her parents for consent.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.183
Okay, thank you, doctor.

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:28.354
Hurts.

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:35.278
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:06.350
My chest hurts.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.732
Check the film on that kid.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:17.028
Take a deep breath.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.529
Inhale, exhale. Again.

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:20.865
Slowly.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.160
Check the film.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:28.372
- Take it easy.
- It hurts.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:29.916
Check the film.

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:32.835
What's the status on that kid?

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:34.420
Possible fractured sternum. Stable.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:35.880
I need you here.

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:40.968
Can you help us?
Bring this kid to Observation Room 2.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:44.180
Yeah, you. Help us out, okay?

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.273
How are you, champ?

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:55.775
My chest hurts.

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.611
Yeah? Does it hurt when you breathe?

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.196
Yes.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.449
That's good. That's good.

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:06.661
- What's your name?
- Joel.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:13.751
Look at this.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.712
We're eating oranges and making IDs.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:18.840
"C.C.H." What's that?

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.426
Cook County Hospital.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:26.347
Just hang on, okay?

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:29.225
– It hurts.
– You'll be okay, pal.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.810
You'll be fine.

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.770
Hold that elevator.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.188
Thank you.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.485
How're you doing?

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.362
My chest hurts.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:43.489
Where's your mom?

01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:44.741
I don't know.

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:46.784
Is she at home?

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.911
I think she's with my brother.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.329
They downstairs?

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:52.373
I don't know.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.333
Don't worry.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.127
We'll find her.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:10:59.756
Do you play football? Baseball?

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.382
Football.

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:04.469
Hold on, son.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.104
Uh...

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:17.565
Hey, doctor.

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:20.818
They sent this one from downstairs.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:30.912
Bob, get this one into Room 4, stat.

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:33.080
Bye-bye, Joel.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.970
Where's that boy I sent down
with the janitor?

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:50.056
– What boy?
– The one with the fractured sternum.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:51.724
He never came here.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:55.353
– He didn't?
– No, he didn't.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:02.151
Hey, you have a particular interest
in our patient's X-rays?

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.696
– What do you mean?
– I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:09.617
– It's a hobby of mine.
– A hobby, really?

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.495
– Yeah.
– What's your other hobby, brain surgery?

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:15.164
– What do you want?
– To know how that boy got to surgery.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:17.500
I'm a janitor. I do as I'm told.

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:20.002
Bullshit. Who changed those orders?

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:22.838
I don't know what you mean.

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:27.927
Stay there.

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:31.806
Maureen, call security!

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:35.685
Hey!

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.937
Hey!

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.440
Excuse me.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:04.171
Tell Stevens to get hold
of that guy Kelly over at C.P.D.

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:10.303
A guy disguised as a janitor orders
an emergency medical procedure...

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:13.222
...and all you did
was take away his ID card?

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:18.019
No. I called Security.
He took off down the hall. What was I to do?

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.645
Listen, Mr. -

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.022
Deputy.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.565
Gerard.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:25.401
I'm really tired.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:26.986
I'd like to go home.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:30.865
– Okay. How's the boy doing?
– He saved his life.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.371
Thank you.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.795
"Desmondo Jose Ruiz. "

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.175
Whoa.

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:51.177
Where are you, Desmondo?

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:55.306
Sammy, this is my problem:

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:58.601
– The place is crawling with cops, right?
– Yeah.

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:01.020
Everybody's looking for Kimble, right?

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:03.105
So why would he be stupid enough...

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.816
...to hang out in the trauma ward
and play Mother Teresa?

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.735
– Excuse me.
– Yeah, sorry.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.046
Have a problem?

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:30.549
– No.
– No, no problem at all.

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:39.975
Excuse me, could we have a word with you?

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:45.898
This is Dr. Elway at Cook County Hospital.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:52.196
I'm following-up for the Prosthetic Clinic
on Matthew Zelick.

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:54.990
Oh, he did?

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.659
I'm terribly sorry.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.872
Right or left?

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.374
Right.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:07.878
- – Age?
- 35 to 45.

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:11.674
This is Ted Riley
with the High School Reunion Committee.

01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:14.552
25 years is just around the corner...

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:18.389
...and Clive is on our list
of missing in action.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:21.809
Information gave me a number,
but when I tried it...

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.562
Oh.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.273
No kidding.

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:29.400
Armed robbery?

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.528
He's where?

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.739
- – Point of attachment?
Mid-humerus.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:37.324
That gives us 47 possibles.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.118
- – 47?
- Robert.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:42.037
Cross-check these people
for criminal records.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:43.247
Wait a minute.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.594
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.800
How you doing?

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.219
– Hey.
– What's happening?

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.974
Driscoll, Clive R.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:47.728
One-armed man, armed robbery.
That's funny.

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.772
Let me ask a question:

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:57.446
If they can dye a river green today...

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.157
...why can't they dye it blue the other days?

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:01.408
Do I know?

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:06.664
– Are you Irish, sir?
– Who, me? No.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:08.290
Are you?

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:10.000
No, man.

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:20.928
Name of inmate?

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.097
Clive Driscoll.

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:24.723
Driscoll, Clive.

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:26.392
ID, please.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.477
Driscoll, Clive R.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:30.354
2-0-1-0.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:34.400
Be advised that, by court ruling,
your conversation can be recorded.

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:40.865
This is hinky. He went to college.
He wouldn't go through all this security...

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:45.411
...go to lock-up to find someone
his own people say doesn't exist.

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:48.080
– Hinky.
– What does that mean, "hinky?"

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:49.415
– Strange.
– Weird.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:52.042
Say "strange" or "weird. "
"Hinky" has no meaning.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.294
Well, we say "hinky. "

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:59.049
I don't want you using meaningless words
around me. I'm taking the stairs.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:03.095
How about "bullshit"?
How about "bullshit," Sam?

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.850
Visitor for Driscoll.

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:10.895
Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:15.900
Over there.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:40.424
Let's go, Driscoll.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.515
You got 5 minutes.

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:50.392
Who are you?

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.729
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:55.397
You got me down here...

01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:57.274
...might as well talk.

01:18:57.483 --> 01:19:00.611
Down here you got no entertainment.
Ain't no cable here.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:05.449
I wish I could, but I can't. Sorry.

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.710
Richard!

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:05.027
Officer, a man in a blue coat is waving a gun
and screaming at a woman.

01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:06.320
Stop that man!

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.030
He's a U.S. Marshal! Let him go!

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:12.034
Let him go! U.S. Marshall, let him go!

01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:13.410
Shut the gates!

01:21:28.967 --> 01:21:30.219
Hold it.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:50.114
Open the doors!

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:00.082
We're on the roof.

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:01.625
We're on the roof.

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.586
Take some men! Look down there!

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:06.672
He's in the plaza!

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.382
He's heading east!

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:10.300
– East through the plaza?
– Where?

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:13.303
<i>– Towards the Picasso?
– He's going east toward the Picasso!</i>

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:26.567
We want you to give
all these groups a big round of applause.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:30.904
They've been waiting a long time
to get in the parade.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:34.032
They're cold, just like all the rest of you.

01:23:57.824 --> 01:24:02.663
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel
that Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:04.456
I have no idea.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:07.376
We understand your deputies
were at the hospital today.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:09.336
Was Dr. Kimble there?

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.505
I have no comment on that.

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.799
Let me get the chronology straight.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:16.802
The subject was tried, convicted,
incarcerated...

01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:21.640
...escaped, presumed dead,
and is now at large in Chicago. Correct?

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:24.059
Except for being presumed dead.

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:27.229
Do you believe that Kimble's
armed and dangerous?

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.398
I believe he's dangerous, yes.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:33.610
He's taking chances, conning back.
Do you feel that perhaps he's innocent?

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:38.282
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted
in a court of law. He's guilty.

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:40.450
How will you try to catch him?

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:42.619
We have no further comments for now.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.846
Alec. Alec.

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:31.431
Richard Kimble.

01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:34.810
Hi, how are you?
– Good, Dr. Kimble.

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:37.979
Lentz.

01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:41.733
<i>We've been trading phone calls
the last few days.</i>

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:04.005
A cruise sponsored
by Devlin MacGregor...

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:05.590
– ... could be fun.
– Enjoy.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:07.259
Hi.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.475
<i>- Cancun, Richard.
- Sport fishing.</i>

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:16.768
Pina coladas.

01:29:16.977 --> 01:29:19.104
What does the hospital have to buy?
What's the catch?

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:20.397
Sailfish.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:23.149
No strings attached.

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:26.236
<i>What do you say? What do you say?</i>

01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:31.533
This guy is bleeding
from every needle puncture.

01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:35.245
Lentz sent this guy in?
Is he on that wonder drug?

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:38.623
Yes, he's on the RDU-90 protocol,
Provasic.

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.333
Drug of the future.

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:43.420
Clean out those arteries
and put us out of business.

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:52.512
"Parade Master of Ceremonies
Ed O'Flaherty said...

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.308
...he didn't recall a livelier parade
during the last 20 years.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:57.934
That Kimble...

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:01.479
– ... is some kind of lad to be running out-"
– "Lad"?

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:03.064
He says "lad. "

01:30:03.273 --> 01:30:05.233
Maybe he's a leprechaun.

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:07.694
– I'm quoting this guy.
– Sam.

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:10.322
A guy on line 3 claims he's Richard Kimble.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.033
– Who?
– Another Kimble on line 3.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.744
- – Let me see the phone.
- Tell him he looks good in a beard.

01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:17.078
- – What line?
- Three.

01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:20.832
"I hope he was able to wear
a little green, sip some whiskey... "

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.709
This is Gerard.

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:26.504
Remember what I told you in the tunnel?

01:30:28.298 --> 01:30:32.135
It's him!
– I remember it was noisy.

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:34.763
I think you said something like...

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:36.640
...you didn't kill your wife.

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:38.475
Remember what you told me?

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:41.645
I remember you pointed my gun at me.

01:30:45.315 --> 01:30:48.193
You said, "I don't care. "

01:30:48.401 --> 01:30:49.778
He's on the south side.

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:55.408
That's right, I don't care.
I'm not trying to solve a puzzle.

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:57.577
I am trying to solve a puzzle.

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.245
Five seconds to location.

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:01.790
And I just found a big piece.

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:03.875
Richard.

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:06.419
Richard?

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:10.840
<i>Richard? Richard?</i>

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:12.425
<i>Hello, Richard?</i>

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:14.010
He didn't hang up. Where is he at?

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:16.346
– Here it comes.
– Where is he at?

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:17.722
256 South St. Lawrence.

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:20.183
Get the C.P.D. over there.

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:22.602
We got a car there now.

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:54.217
Get some shots of that.

01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:58.805
Fredrick Sykes...

01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:04.144
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:06.271
You want to look at this?

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:07.939
Yeah.

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:12.485
Kimble's prints.
They're all over, but mainly on the desk.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:15.572
He sure had interest in these photos.
Flipped through the whole package.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.115
– Paused here.
– Negatives in there?

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:18.616
– Right there.
– Let me have them.

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:21.494
<i>Camera boy's on his way.
– We got you.</i>

01:32:38.511 --> 01:32:40.054
How you doing, Mr. Sykes?

01:32:40.263 --> 01:32:43.266
– Fine, if you tell me what's happening.
– We had a problem.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.519
– My place or the place upstairs?
– Your place.

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:49.230
- – Well, now.
- Step right in, Mr. Sykes.

01:32:49.439 --> 01:32:52.442
Everybody knows my name here.
Big happy family, huh?

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:56.321
What is this, a trench coat convention?
What's going on?

01:32:56.529 --> 01:32:59.115
Who are you guys? What's going on?

01:33:02.952 --> 01:33:05.121
You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:07.373
I sure hope you're a cop.

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:10.710
No, I'm Samuel Gerard,
United States Marshal's office.

01:33:11.795 --> 01:33:16.466
This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble
made a phone call from here.

01:33:16.966 --> 01:33:18.384
Why would he do that?

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:21.137
I don't know any Richard Kimble.

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:29.062
Okay, I got it.

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:31.523
The doctor who killed his wife, right?

01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:36.152
Blamed somebody with a prosthetic.
Is he coming after me?

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:38.071
Does he have reason to do so?

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:41.199
I have a prosthetic arm! I must've done it!

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:44.911
Give me a break.
I went through all this a year ago.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:47.789
I was questioned here about the whole thing.

01:33:47.997 --> 01:33:52.210
I told them I wasn't in Chicago that night.
I was away on business.

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:54.170
Fifteen people verified it.

01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:55.839
What line of business are you in?

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:57.799
Security.

01:33:58.007 --> 01:34:00.510
– Who do you work for?
– A pharmaceutical company.

01:34:00.718 --> 01:34:02.303
– Which one?
– Devlin MacGregor.

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:04.931
I handle security for the top executives.

01:34:06.933 --> 01:34:10.603
Any idea why Kimble would be interested
in these photographs?

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:13.273
No.

01:34:13.857 --> 01:34:15.900
Where were they taken?

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:17.569
Jeez, that's a big fish!

01:34:17.777 --> 01:34:19.320
Cancun, Mexico.

01:34:19.529 --> 01:34:22.156
It was a junket the company paid for,
for some doctors.

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:25.451
– Kimble go with you?
– You don't see him there, do you?

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:30.832
No. I told you I don't know him.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.418
Mind if I check to see if anything's missing?

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:35.461
No, I don't mind.

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:42.802
How'd you lose that arm?

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:45.054
In the line of duty.

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:57.317
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.

01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:59.485
Yes, he is.

01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:02.822
– You want our people on him?
– Yes. Build a camp here.

01:35:03.031 --> 01:35:04.198
– Henry.
– I'll take care of it.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:05.700
- – Noah.
- Yes, sir?

01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:09.996
See this picture? I want you to find out
who the guy is next to Sykes.

01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:14.042
Find out his name, age, weight,
social security number...

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:17.921
...his location, relatives, pets, everything.

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:40.610
Sorry, doctor, they said it was an emergency.

01:35:43.112 --> 01:35:45.114
Thank you. Excuse me.

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:59.003
<i>- – Hello.
- Mr. Bolton.</i>

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.422
<i>– Chuck.
– Richard.</i>

01:36:01.631 --> 01:36:02.966
Can you talk?

01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:06.970
Yes, I'm on a hotel phone.
How are you? What's going on?

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:10.974
I found him.
I found the man who killed Helen.

01:36:11.683 --> 01:36:14.727
– What?
– It was me they were after.

01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:16.187
Who are they?

01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:19.899
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.

01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:23.444
Lentz was supervising the protocol
for RDU-90.

01:36:23.653 --> 01:36:26.823
He knew I found out
it was causing liver damage. It was Lentz.

01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:31.744
Richard, Lentz is dead.

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:34.288
What? How?

01:36:34.497 --> 01:36:37.250
<i>He died in a car accident last summer.</i>

01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:42.046
<i>– Richard?
– Yeah.</i>

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:44.090
Can you prove this about the drug?

01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:46.259
I think so.

01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:49.345
I need your help.

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:53.099
Call Bones at the hospital.
Tell him to give me any help I need.

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:54.350
Sure.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:55.893
I'll call him now.

01:36:56.102 --> 01:36:57.353
Okay. Thanks.

01:37:03.901 --> 01:37:05.528
– Dr. Nichols.
– Hey!

01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:07.155
– How are you doing?
– Good.

01:37:07.363 --> 01:37:08.906
Dr. Nichols!

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:11.492
Can we ask you a few more questions?

01:37:11.701 --> 01:37:12.910
Mr. Gerard.

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:17.498
You got a copy of that photograph?
U.S. Marshal Service.

01:37:17.707 --> 01:37:19.042
Excuse us.

01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:23.963
This is Fredrick Sykes.

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:27.925
He's a security specialist
at Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

01:37:28.134 --> 01:37:30.428
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.

01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:33.473
– Do you know this man?
– No, I don't.

01:37:35.308 --> 01:37:38.519
You're getting pretty desperate, aren't you,
Mr. Gerard?

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:39.979
Oh, yes.

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.815
I told you you wouldn't find Richard.

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:44.317
Has he been to see you?

01:37:44.984 --> 01:37:46.277
No.

01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:49.989
We've been over this ground before,
haven't we?

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.324
Yeah.

01:37:52.325 --> 01:37:54.577
So if you'll excuse me.

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:58.581
– Sure. Thanks, doc.
– Thank you, doctor.

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:00.833
Dr. Nichols.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:03.836
Sorry. One more question
about the photograph.

01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:07.048
See the guy standing on the right side
of the fish?

01:38:07.256 --> 01:38:09.092
– Ever see him before?
– No.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.010
– This guy right here?
– Mm-hm.

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:14.055
I've never seen that person before.

01:38:14.263 --> 01:38:15.932
– Okay.
– I'm sorry.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.350
Thank you.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.104
Thank you, doctor.
Enjoy the rest of the convention.

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:28.653
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-Invasive...

01:38:28.861 --> 01:38:30.947
...Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.

01:38:31.155 --> 01:38:33.407
Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols. "

01:38:33.616 --> 01:38:35.451
Bet they line up for this one.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:54.262
If you were Richard Kimble...

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:58.224
...why would you hunt for a one-armed man
you say killed your wife...

01:38:58.433 --> 01:39:01.936
...break into his house,
call us up and then split?

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:03.938
I should have been a doctor.

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:08.609
Look at this blowup.
This guy in the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.

01:39:09.152 --> 01:39:11.362
Chicago Memorial. Kimble's hospital.
I want to go there.

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:12.822
Go.

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:14.490
Wait.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:19.120
Devlin MacGregor...

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:23.040
...did 7 and one half billion dollars
in net sales...

01:39:24.041 --> 01:39:25.793
...last year alone.

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:29.547
That company's a monster.

01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:39.473
Talk to me.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:45.229
Absolutely.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:47.773
It's a liver sample...

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:50.776
...from a patient on the RDU-90 drug study.

01:39:50.985 --> 01:39:52.778
January 21st?

01:39:52.987 --> 01:39:54.363
Ah!

01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:56.407
The last one!

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:58.284
1-7-4-3-0?

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.828
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.

01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:05.166
Thanks.
I'll make sure all this gets back to you.

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:11.756
– It's good to see you again.
– Good to see you.

01:40:11.964 --> 01:40:15.468
Whatever happened to that thing
with your wife?

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:19.680
It's not over yet.

01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:41.786
What's going on?

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:43.621
How should I know?

01:40:56.926 --> 01:41:00.763
I think his name is Alec Lentz.
A pathologist.

01:41:01.222 --> 01:41:02.890
I remember because he died last summer.

01:41:12.233 --> 01:41:14.235
Oh, my God. Richard!

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:16.737
What are you doing here?

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:18.406
Hi, Kath.

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.256
Have a look.

01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:39.885
– What do you think?
– Cold normal.

01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:42.305
Clearly not the same tissue.

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:46.183
And not only did they all come
from healthy livers...

01:41:46.684 --> 01:41:48.686
...they came from the same liver.

01:41:50.855 --> 01:41:52.523
Kath, you beauty.

01:41:59.113 --> 01:42:00.197
Excuse me.

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.241
Mr. Roosevelt?

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:03.492
Yes.

01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:06.787
We're deputies Biggs and Newman.
We're U.S. Marshals.

01:42:07.371 --> 01:42:10.958
Need some information about a Dr. Lentz
who was on staff here.

01:42:11.167 --> 01:42:15.796
Did he know or have any contact
with a Dr. Richard Kimble?

01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:17.965
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.

01:42:19.133 --> 01:42:20.343
I didn't ask that.

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.137
I wouldn't know.

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:27.308
If you'll excuse me,
I have prior obligations to attend to.

01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:30.102
- Mr. Roosevelt.
- Yes?

01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:32.897
I think you're lying to us.

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.358
Lentz is the bad guy?

01:42:36.609 --> 01:42:38.069
Yeah, why not?

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:43.240
He was one of the original
patent holders in RDU-90.

01:42:44.575 --> 01:42:46.702
I was sending in my tissue samples...

01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:51.123
...he was replacing them with healthy samples,
issuing path reports...

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:53.125
...shit-canning my stuff. Easy.

01:42:53.334 --> 01:42:54.502
Wait a minute.

01:42:54.919 --> 01:42:57.338
Lentz died August 21st.

01:42:57.672 --> 01:42:59.215
Yeah.

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:03.844
Half the samples he approved
were signed the day he died.

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:06.722
You're kidding.

01:43:08.349 --> 01:43:11.102
Someone else must have been
manipulating this.

01:43:11.769 --> 01:43:13.229
Someone with access.

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:26.409
Thanks, Kath.

01:43:26.617 --> 01:43:28.035
Where are you going?

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:30.871
To see a friend.

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:38.295
This is giving me a headache.

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:42.425
That's surprising.
Where did Roosevelt say Kimble was going?

01:43:42.633 --> 01:43:44.677
He says he doesn't know.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:46.971
<i>– Do you believe him?
– Yes, I do.</i>

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:49.849
<i>– He says he picked up tissue samples...
– What?</i>

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:51.434
<i>...for a drug study.</i>

01:43:51.642 --> 01:43:53.144
Get this:

01:43:53.394 --> 01:43:56.480
The release was approved
by Dr. Charles Nichols.

01:43:57.231 --> 01:43:59.859
<i>Nichols also knew Lentz.</i>

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:02.069
<i>Whoa.
– He was Lentz's boss.</i>

01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:03.654
He was covering for Kimble.

01:44:03.988 --> 01:44:05.781
Send the C.P.D. there right now.

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:10.286
We're sending cops.
Make sure they turn that place inside out.

01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:13.914
Don't let them give you shit
about your ponytail. Well done.

01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:15.666
My pleasure.

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:18.294
Henry.

01:44:18.502 --> 01:44:20.379
Dr. Nichols lied to me.

01:44:20.588 --> 01:44:22.590
– Go find him.
– I'm on it.

01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:31.891
Okay, it's gone by now.

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:35.561
I looked every place you told me
and I didn't see him.

01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:36.896
I'm telling you.

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:40.107
If he was in the hospital,
I would have found him.

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:42.193
What do you want me to do?

01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:45.112
Hold on. Wait a minute.

01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:47.865
I marked him. I got him now.

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:19.063
Dr. Alexander Lentz.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.608
"A noted pathologist
at Chicago Memorial Hospital...

01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:26.278
...was walking to his daily tennis match
when an unidentified vehicle...

01:45:26.487 --> 01:45:31.867
...slammed his body into the barriers
separating the Drive from Lake Michigan. "

01:45:32.368 --> 01:45:33.410
Yuck.

01:45:33.619 --> 01:45:36.622
Sam, you won't believe this.

01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:40.209
Sykes' records for the past two years
show no calls to Kimble.

01:45:40.626 --> 01:45:41.669
It was a thought.

01:45:41.877 --> 01:45:45.548
But when I cross-checked Kimble's records,
one came up.

01:45:45.756 --> 01:45:46.966
Kimble called Sykes-

01:45:49.426 --> 01:45:50.678
Get Sykes in here now.

01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:52.555
- on the night of the murder...

01:45:52.763 --> 01:45:54.098
...7:30 p. m...

01:45:54.306 --> 01:45:55.683
...from his car phone.

01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:58.394
Do you have Kimble's arrest report?

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.985
– 7:30 p. m.
– 19:30 hours.

01:46:07.987 --> 01:46:10.322
They just went in. Sykes is gone.

01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:11.699
He's nowhere to be found.

01:46:11.907 --> 01:46:14.159
– What?
– He's gone.

01:47:18.641 --> 01:47:21.060
Uh, listen, this is transit unit number 23.

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:26.523
Possible sighting of Richard Kimble
on northbound El coming into Van Buren.

01:47:29.818 --> 01:47:31.737
Move to the door.

01:47:39.703 --> 01:47:42.998
<i>Next stop, Balbo Station. Balbo.</i>

01:47:43.248 --> 01:47:44.917
This is my stop.

01:47:46.335 --> 01:47:48.003
My stop too.

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:50.964
Kimble.

01:48:48.272 --> 01:48:49.732
You missed your stop.

01:49:12.921 --> 01:49:16.508
A transit cop saw Kimble on the El,
heading toward Balbo.

01:49:16.717 --> 01:49:19.053
The C.P.D. is on the way.

01:49:54.046 --> 01:49:55.506
<i>Attention all units.</i>

01:49:55.714 --> 01:49:58.759
<i>Transit police report officer down
at Balbo Station.</i>

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:01.428
<i>Kimble is suspect.</i>

01:50:02.012 --> 01:50:03.430
What'd he do, shoot a cop?

01:50:03.639 --> 01:50:06.016
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:13.357
It is a joy and a privilege...

01:50:14.191 --> 01:50:17.194
...to introduce tonight's keynote speaker.

01:50:27.621 --> 01:50:29.414
For the past four years...

01:50:29.623 --> 01:50:32.918
...he has served
as the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:36.296
...and administrative chief of Pathology...

01:50:36.505 --> 01:50:38.882
...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.

01:50:43.554 --> 01:50:45.889
Where are the emergency exits?

01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:50.978
<i>Suspect seen entering
Hilton Tower Mall, lower level.</i>

01:50:51.854 --> 01:50:54.565
You don't think-
– Yeah, I know where he's going.

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:58.026
Biggs, Newman, where are you?

01:50:59.987 --> 01:51:04.867
He was appointed to the Board of Directors
of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:07.661
<i>Will you please welcome...</i>

01:51:08.078 --> 01:51:10.247
...Dr. Charles Nichols?

01:51:16.795 --> 01:51:19.214
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen...

01:51:19.423 --> 01:51:21.341
...friends and colleagues.

01:51:21.925 --> 01:51:24.177
<i>It's great you're all here tonight.</i>

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:40.485
C.P.D. reported an officer down
and a guy with two guns-

01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:42.613
– Kimble do it?
– Conflicting reports.

01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:44.656
He entered the hotel from the subway.

01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:46.491
- – That's my man!
- Not anymore.

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:48.785
He's going down.
You can help by staying out.

01:51:48.994 --> 01:51:50.329
Arrest us!

01:51:50.537 --> 01:51:52.873
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:58.128
<i>All units report when
lower level is secure.</i>

01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:03.217
<i>All units, secure all lower level exits.</i>

01:52:04.051 --> 01:52:07.804
Noah, find the hotel security office.
Stay in touch with me by radio.

01:52:10.974 --> 01:52:12.434
Now, a new drug...

01:52:12.643 --> 01:52:16.647
...on the cusp of approval
by the Food and Drug Administration...

01:52:16.897 --> 01:52:20.984
...is poised to change
these old methods forever.

01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:24.905
– Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.
– How you doing.

01:52:25.322 --> 01:52:26.990
Good. Sam, I'm in.

01:52:30.744 --> 01:52:34.414
- through the normal metabolic
pathways in the liver.

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:37.668
The drug's name is...

01:52:37.876 --> 01:52:39.294
...Provasic.

01:52:40.837 --> 01:52:42.965
As I will show you tonight...

01:52:43.173 --> 01:52:45.926
...Provasic is remarkably effective...

01:52:46.134 --> 01:52:49.346
...and has no side effects whatsoever.

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:52.266
It is also noteworthy that this drug-

01:52:57.521 --> 01:52:59.773
This drug was developed...

01:52:59.982 --> 01:53:03.151
...in cooperation, not competition
with Chicago Memorial Hospital...

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:05.028
...in what we hope will be...

01:53:05.237 --> 01:53:08.115
...the model for a continued dishonest...

01:53:08.865 --> 01:53:10.367
Excuse me, honest...

01:53:14.162 --> 01:53:15.330
...open joint ventures...

01:53:15.539 --> 01:53:18.041
...between academic medicine...

01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:20.294
...and the pharmaceutical...

01:53:20.544 --> 01:53:22.004
Richard.

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:26.842
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of this speech.

01:53:27.217 --> 01:53:28.969
You almost got away with it.

01:53:31.555 --> 01:53:33.140
I know all about it.

01:53:34.975 --> 01:53:36.268
I can prove it.

01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:41.690
Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...

01:53:41.898 --> 01:53:43.400
...obviously...

01:53:43.817 --> 01:53:47.112
...so just go on with your
dessert and coffee...

01:53:47.404 --> 01:53:50.866
Richard, do you mind stepping aside
and let's talk.

01:53:51.074 --> 01:53:52.451
Okay.

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:55.746
So I'll be back in just a second.

01:53:59.583 --> 01:54:02.002
You changed the samples, didn't you?

01:54:03.754 --> 01:54:06.048
You switched the samples...

01:54:06.256 --> 01:54:09.051
– ... after Lentz died.
– Richard, let-

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:12.179
Let's stay calm, people.

01:54:13.597 --> 01:54:17.017
After Lentz died,
you were the only one who had access.

01:54:18.185 --> 01:54:20.270
You switched the samples...

01:54:20.771 --> 01:54:22.981
...and the pathology reports.

01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:24.566
Did you kill Lentz too?

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:26.109
Call Security.

01:54:26.318 --> 01:54:27.360
Did you?

01:54:28.153 --> 01:54:30.781
He falsified his research...

01:54:32.115 --> 01:54:34.493
...so RDU-90 could be...

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.036
...approved and...

01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:39.373
...Devlin MacGregor could give you Provasic.

01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:43.043
It's all over, folks.

01:54:43.251 --> 01:54:45.128
Just stay calm.

01:55:01.603 --> 01:55:04.731
You never give up, do you?
You never give up!

01:55:27.587 --> 01:55:28.630
Why Helen?

01:55:31.633 --> 01:55:32.884
Glad you're here.

01:55:33.093 --> 01:55:34.136
Which way'd they go?

01:55:34.344 --> 01:55:36.263
– Toward the Presidential Suite.
– Where's that?

01:55:36.471 --> 01:55:38.807
– Southeast corner.
– How many exits are there from this room?

01:55:39.015 --> 01:55:42.853
We got a total of four:
two on the east, two on the west.

01:55:44.187 --> 01:55:45.313
Kimble's on the roof!

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:47.607
Cosmo, that way.

01:56:00.370 --> 01:56:02.581
Stop! Stay where you are!

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:04.583
This is the Chicago police!

01:56:05.292 --> 01:56:07.252
Put your hands in the air!

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:09.713
The building is totally secure.

01:56:10.046 --> 01:56:12.465
I repeat, do not move!

01:56:13.383 --> 01:56:15.051
Put your hands in the air!

01:56:15.677 --> 01:56:18.305
I repeat, stay where you are!

01:56:41.912 --> 01:56:43.079
Talk to me.

01:56:43.288 --> 01:56:45.957
They're headed to the north end of the roof.

01:56:46.166 --> 01:56:47.334
Newman!

01:56:48.335 --> 01:56:50.378
Get that helicopter out of here!

01:56:54.216 --> 01:56:56.218
As soon as you get a clean shot...

01:56:56.426 --> 01:56:58.094
...take him out.

01:57:16.279 --> 01:57:18.240
Get rid of the helicopter!

01:57:18.448 --> 01:57:20.450
<i>Why?
– Because I don't want to get shot!</i>

01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:24.913
C.P.D., there's a U.S. Marshal on the roof.
Hold your fire!

01:57:25.205 --> 01:57:27.541
<i>Call off the helicopter!</i>

01:57:38.134 --> 01:57:39.844
Ah!

01:58:15.088 --> 01:58:16.423
Don't shoot.

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:21.553
This guy ever quit?

01:58:21.761 --> 01:58:23.722
Find out where that elevator stops.

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:25.056
Newman. Newman!

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:27.642
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?

01:58:27.851 --> 01:58:30.103
Where did they go? Where did they go?

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:02.427
– Stopped on 5th floor.
– They're on the 5th.

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:04.387
- – What's on the 5th floor?
- The laundry.

01:59:04.596 --> 01:59:05.805
It's the laundry.

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.433
<i>They stopped at the laundry.</i>

01:59:52.602 --> 01:59:55.605
We're on the 5th floor. What's your 20?

01:59:56.690 --> 01:59:58.024
Right behind you.

01:59:58.274 --> 02:00:00.026
What's going on here?

02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:03.655
We must keep the C.P.D. out.
They're too hot for me.

02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:05.907
Get rid of all these people.

02:00:06.116 --> 02:00:07.409
Okay, people, stay calm.

02:00:07.617 --> 02:00:09.285
Cosmo, come with me.

02:01:30.617 --> 02:01:33.286
Dr. Richard Kimble!

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:35.955
There's no way out of here!

02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:40.210
The entire building is locked down!

02:01:42.879 --> 02:01:44.923
Give it up, you don't have any time!

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:47.884
Chicago Police thinks you're a cop killer!

02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:51.721
They will shoot you on sight!

02:01:55.391 --> 02:01:57.477
I know you're innocent!

02:01:58.895 --> 02:02:01.356
I know about Fredrick Sykes!

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:06.820
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!

02:02:08.738 --> 02:02:12.033
He borrowed your car
the night of your wife's murder!

02:02:12.242 --> 02:02:13.868
He had the keys!

02:02:14.077 --> 02:02:16.079
No forced entry.

02:02:17.413 --> 02:02:20.250
He telephoned Sykes from your car,
Richard!

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.592
Give it up!

02:02:31.928 --> 02:02:34.931
I'm either lying or I'm gonna shoot you!

02:02:36.099 --> 02:02:37.600
What do you think?

02:02:56.953 --> 02:03:00.331
Give it up! It's time to stop running!

02:03:40.997 --> 02:03:42.749
They killed my wife.

02:03:43.583 --> 02:03:44.918
I know it.

02:03:46.586 --> 02:03:47.837
I know it.

02:03:49.839 --> 02:03:51.174
But it's over now.

02:03:53.343 --> 02:03:56.054
Whew. You know, I'm glad.

02:03:56.262 --> 02:03:57.931
I need the rest.

02:04:12.612 --> 02:04:14.489
Who killed Kimble's wife?

02:04:14.697 --> 02:04:16.574
Kimble was convicted of it.

02:04:16.783 --> 02:04:19.494
You've got a one-armed man in custody.

02:04:19.702 --> 02:04:21.663
- – Is that the guy?
- I have no idea.

02:04:21.871 --> 02:04:23.498
How many one-armed men are there?

02:04:23.706 --> 02:04:25.375
There're a lot of them.

02:04:25.583 --> 02:04:27.543
Could you have made a mistake?

02:04:30.630 --> 02:04:32.256
The one-armed man is also there.

02:04:32.465 --> 02:04:34.467
I've never seen so much
since I've been around here.

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:37.553
You got a deadline, play the weather again.

02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:40.473
Tell Samuel Gerard I'm going home now.

02:04:40.682 --> 02:04:42.642
I'm taking my vacation.

02:04:45.895 --> 02:04:48.231
Clear this area. Everybody clear.

02:05:05.915 --> 02:05:07.166
Watch your head.

02:05:18.428 --> 02:05:20.263
Where is that thing?

02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:22.849
Let me see those hands, doctor.

02:05:41.284 --> 02:05:42.785
I thought you didn't care.

02:05:42.994 --> 02:05:44.287
I don't.

02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:49.125
Don't tell anybody, okay?
