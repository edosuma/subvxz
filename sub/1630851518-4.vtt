WEBVTT

00:13.143 --> 00:15.754
Alright, I'm nervous.
Is that normal?

00:15.798 --> 00:17.930
Well, public speaking
isn't for everyone.
Yeah.

00:17.974 --> 00:20.150
This isn't the public, though --
it's my people.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.065
Well, teaching our own people
is sometimes harder

00:22.109 --> 00:23.327
than an anonymous crowd.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.199
Because we know how petty
and mean they are?

00:27.070 --> 00:28.680
Sean Beckett.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.073
I heard you'd been moved
over here.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.422
My condolences.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.858
DeeDee,
are you keeping tabs on me?

00:32.902 --> 00:34.077
I am flattered.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.514
DeeDee?
Mm-hmm.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.299
Yeah, Chief Cummings
thought that "Diane"

00:38.342 --> 00:39.778
was too uptight a name
for a firefighter,

00:39.822 --> 00:42.042
so he renamed her
at the academy.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.130
Yeah, what was
your nickname again?

00:43.173 --> 00:44.740
Uh..."Last Place"?

00:46.176 --> 00:48.222
Doesn't ring a bell.
How are your kids?

00:48.265 --> 00:49.832
- Driving.
- Mm. Terrifying.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.051
Thank you
for that heads-up.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.748
Well, thanks for letting us
do this here.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.750
Yeah, you know me.
Anything to beat 23.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.708
It's not really about
winning or losing, Beckett.

00:56.752 --> 00:57.927
It's always about that,
DeeDee.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.586
- DeeDee.
- Nope.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.989
Heard we're headed to
19 for the day.

01:18.513 --> 01:22.125
If ever there was a time
for a big, big fire, it's now.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.954
Herrera, feel free to give
my turnouts a quick scrub

01:24.997 --> 01:27.087
when you get done with yours,
huh?

01:27.130 --> 01:29.001
Let's go, 23.
Off to 19 for

01:29.045 --> 01:31.439
conflict resolution training,
whatever that is.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.005
It's crisis intervention.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.137
Whatever.
Just don't make me

01:34.181 --> 01:35.573
look bad
in front of Beckett.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.053
Prick beats me in
football squares every year,

01:37.097 --> 01:38.446
and he's a sore winner.

01:43.059 --> 01:45.583
Maddox, do you
set a goal each morning

01:45.627 --> 01:48.456
to see if you can be more
disgusting than the day before?

01:52.634 --> 01:54.940
She's so into me.

01:56.290 --> 02:00.250
So, uh, how are Joey's
college applications coming?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.470
Good. Good. I mean, he's --
I think he's on track.

02:02.513 --> 02:03.340
You know, Miranda's doing
all the proof-reading.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.037
Mm-hmm.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.213
I got the easy part. I just tell
him to write his essay.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.171
I --
Ben?

02:08.215 --> 02:09.781
Hi.
Oh, um...

02:09.825 --> 02:11.174
Ingrid, right?

02:11.218 --> 02:12.741
You remembered me.

02:12.784 --> 02:13.959
You were very kind
in front of my son,

02:14.003 --> 02:17.049
who thinks I'm incredibly
uncool, so, yeah.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.355
Uh, what do you got there?

02:18.399 --> 02:21.880
Oh, I'm rebuilding
my store. Yay.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.317
And I was hoping I could
get your expert eye

02:23.360 --> 02:24.796
on the blueprints?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.320
I want to make sure
everything is up to code

02:26.363 --> 02:28.191
so nothing happens again.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.019
Um, well, uh...

02:30.062 --> 02:31.673
I'm running a little bit
late today...

02:31.716 --> 02:33.283
Oh, no, of course.
Please.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.546
I wouldn't want to keep you
from saving any more lives.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.723
Um, maybe I could leave these
here with you?

02:38.767 --> 02:40.682
Um, sure. Sure.
Okay.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.945
And, um, do -- do you have
a card or something?

02:42.988 --> 02:45.121
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.210
Great. Alright. I'll, uh --
I'll take a look.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.255
Thank you so much.

02:48.298 --> 02:51.083
Alright. Take care.
Bye.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.391
What?

02:54.435 --> 02:55.871
You got yourself
a badge bunny.
No.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.002
Yeah, you do.
No! No, no.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.091
She -- She's a harmless,
thankful woman

02:59.135 --> 03:00.876
who's been through
a trauma...
Most bunnies are.

03:00.919 --> 03:01.572
...and is just trying to make
sure it doesn't happen again.

03:01.616 --> 03:02.747
Yeah. No, I get it.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.749
Hey, uh, Sweaty, Sweatier,

03:04.793 --> 03:07.143
23 is on their way.
Get changed.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.319
Thanks.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.495
- What's up with him?
- I was literally
going to do that.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.540
Victoria.
Hm?

03:12.583 --> 03:13.932
Hey. Hi. Travis here.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.456
Do you know
how embarrassing it is

03:15.499 --> 03:16.718
to have
your smoke alarm battery

03:16.761 --> 03:18.894
go off when
you're a firefighter?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.591
Because you were supposed to
buy batteries

03:20.635 --> 03:21.940
when you went
grocery shopping.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.551
Okay, I don't remember that
being assigned to me.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.422
I texted you while
you were in the store.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.467
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

03:26.510 --> 03:27.294
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.034
No, you didn't.
Mm!

03:29.078 --> 03:30.471
Sorry, I was there.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.560
Okay, you're supposed to
be conflict <i>resolution.</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:38.261
Huh.
What?

03:38.305 --> 03:39.436
My dad just texted me,

03:39.480 --> 03:41.351
"Going to San Diego
next week with Kyle.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.614
Could you check on
your mother once or twice?"

03:43.658 --> 03:45.399
Is this Kyle,
secret-boyfriend-Kyle?

03:45.442 --> 03:47.052
Kyle,
secret-boyfriend-Kyle.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.577
Hey, guys.
23's almost here.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.752
Barn. Now.

03:50.795 --> 03:51.970
Coming. Jeez.
Okay.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.886
"She thinks it's a conference,
by the way."

03:54.930 --> 03:56.279
Oh, wait,
so your dad is going...

03:56.323 --> 03:57.411
Going on vacation
with his lover

03:57.454 --> 03:59.239
and wants me
to cover for him.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.243
Yeesh.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.380
They say you're not supposed
to read your own press.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.295
I'm not. This is from
my damn divorce lawyer.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.123
This -- <i> I've</i> been dragged into
the middle of that already.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.690
I don't want to get in
any deeper.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.258
Well, I'm not the one
who dragged you.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.737
I didn't say you were.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.610
Hey. 23's almost here.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.046
23's coming?

04:24.089 --> 04:25.613
Yeah.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.528
Crisis One training.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.791
Does no one read my texts?

04:35.492 --> 04:37.712
Oh, fun. A wedding.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.454
I guess that makes us
the groom's side.

04:40.497 --> 04:45.546
Oho, oh! Damn!
Is that <i>the</i> Fire Zaddy?

04:45.589 --> 04:47.983
Okay, okay, everybody.
Shut up.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.028
We're here for some training,
just like any other day.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.421
I'd like to finish by dinner

04:51.465 --> 04:54.598
so I don't have to
share my meatballs with 23.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.426
DeeDee,
can we get started please?

04:56.470 --> 04:58.036
Thank you.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.690
Hi, everybody. Um...

04:59.734 --> 05:01.562
For those of you
who don't know me,

05:01.605 --> 05:02.911
I'm Diane Lewis.

05:02.954 --> 05:03.999
Hey, Diane.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.957
Good to see you again,
Pat.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.655
Today I'm here
in a different role

05:07.698 --> 05:09.613
than many of you may know me.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.007
In addition to my work
as a grief counselor,

05:12.050 --> 05:15.663
I'm also certified
in crisis intervention training.

05:15.706 --> 05:18.840
Now, as you know,
Dean Miller has spearheaded

05:18.883 --> 05:21.799
the Crisis One program
here in SFD...Whoo!
Yeah!

05:21.843 --> 05:24.019
...and we're all very proud.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.369
- Yes!
- Yeah!

05:28.589 --> 05:31.374
Yeah, now, you'll find
all your protocols in there.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.767
You probably know
most of them already,

05:32.810 --> 05:35.204
we're just reframing them
through this program

05:35.247 --> 05:37.989
with the goal of eliminating
the police and their weapons

05:38.033 --> 05:39.817
from the situation.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.298
Now, a mental health crisis
can evoke fear.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.040
An armed response leads to
unnecessary trauma,

05:45.083 --> 05:47.564
and in the worst cases,
loss of life.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.566
So why don't we just,
uh, jump right in

05:49.610 --> 05:50.915
with some role play?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.308
Okay, lucky for us,

05:52.352 --> 05:55.093
we have our very own
married couple in the house.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.226
Herrera and Sullivan,
why don't you come on up here?

05:57.269 --> 05:58.575
And we'll start on page 7

05:58.619 --> 06:01.012
with the "marital dispute"
scenario.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.971
Oh, man.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.102
Oh, man.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.582
Oh, man.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.676
Or...we could
take volunteers --No, I'm game.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.417
I'm game.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.376
I'm game.

06:17.855 --> 06:18.856
Herrera?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.167
Fine. Yeah.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.822
Let's do it.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.005
We're gonna be
role-playing scenarios

06:37.048 --> 06:38.702
that you may encounter
while on Crisis One calls.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.226
Your job is
to secure the scene,

06:41.270 --> 06:42.750
build trust and rapport
with the patient,

06:42.793 --> 06:45.361
and find a solution,
if you can.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.234
Now, I will be the responder
for this first one.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.019
And you two are
the married couple.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.195
The wife has
locked the husband outside

06:53.238 --> 06:55.502
and is throwing his stuff out
onto the sidewalk.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.242
Someone called 911
because the husband

06:57.286 --> 06:58.766
is screaming
and threatening her.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.115
Okay, Diane, I think
maybe we should not --

07:00.158 --> 07:02.334
Are you crazy?!

07:02.378 --> 07:03.988
Hm?

07:06.991 --> 07:11.561
Rob-- Roberto,
do not call me crazy.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.955
You --
You screwed my best friend!

07:13.998 --> 07:15.565
I did no such thing!

07:15.609 --> 07:17.741
You believe what
you want to believe!

07:17.785 --> 07:20.352
Hey there, sir. Uh.
What seems to be the problem?

07:20.396 --> 07:23.312
Um, my wife,
she has locked me out,

07:23.355 --> 07:25.488
and she is trashing
my stuff

07:25.532 --> 07:28.491
and throwing one year of
marriage into the garbage.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.710
I can't look away.

07:29.753 --> 07:30.711
That sounds frustrating.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.539
That's not the word
I would use.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.192
We often hurt
the ones we love the most.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.716
Lady, I don't need
your counseling.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.935
I just need my wife
to stop throwing my stuff

07:37.979 --> 07:40.503
- out the window!
- Well, if he hadn't
betrayed me,

07:40.547 --> 07:41.896
- I wouldn't be doing it!
- But -- And she doesn't listen!

07:41.939 --> 07:43.680
Oh, my God.

07:43.724 --> 07:47.423
Okay? She's not even willing
to have a conversation.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.598
It's like talking to
a brick wall.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.600
Says the concrete wall.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.342
Okay, I can see that
you're both really angry --

07:53.385 --> 07:55.126
You know, maybe if he
didn't always act like

07:55.170 --> 07:56.737
he knows me better
than I know myself...

07:56.780 --> 07:58.260
You don't even know --

07:58.303 --> 08:00.218
She doesn't even know
herself.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.003
Fighting with her is like
fighting with a teenager.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.179
Oh.
It's like you're
permanently stuck at age 17.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.833
Oh, for someone who's never
been a parent,

08:05.876 --> 08:07.574
you sure know how to
condescend like one.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.401
- Condescend like one?
- Oh, thank God.

08:09.445 --> 08:12.666
<i>Engine 19 requested
to 3667 Egre Road. </i>

08:12.709 --> 08:14.755
Sullivan, you're with me.

08:18.889 --> 08:22.414
Okay, uh...Beckett.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.415
Do you want to fill in
for Sullivan?

08:23.459 --> 08:24.460
Oh, God.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.983
Uh...I don't --

08:26.984 --> 08:29.421
Uh. I'll do it.

08:29.465 --> 08:30.640
Ah.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.557
What is this, now?

08:36.951 --> 08:39.127
How could you do me
like that, Teresa?

08:39.170 --> 08:40.607
- She's crazy!
- Who's Teresa?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.783
And she threw my record
collection out the window!

08:42.826 --> 08:44.698
Sounds like
- you deserve it!
- Hughes.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.003
Sorry! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

08:46.047 --> 08:49.180
You jackass. You --
With my best friend?!

08:49.224 --> 08:50.921
- What?
- Okay, and I just feel like

08:50.965 --> 08:52.532
these scenarios
are harmful stereotypes.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.316
Hughes, why don't you come
and play the first responder?

08:54.359 --> 08:55.796
- Hmm?Mnh. Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.101
- Come on.
- Come on, Hughes.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.973
No.
Yeah, yeah.

08:59.016 --> 08:59.974
No, no. I got this.

09:01.845 --> 09:05.370
Remember, compassion.
Empathy.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.981
- Compassion and empathy.
- Compassion and empathy.

09:07.024 --> 09:07.982
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:08.025 --> 09:08.939
Let's go.
Let's see it.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.550
Um, sir...

09:10.593 --> 09:14.510
Whatever happened
before today doesn't matter.

09:14.554 --> 09:19.123
What matters now is making sure
no one gets hurt

09:19.167 --> 09:22.736
and, uh,
keeping you safe, okay?

09:22.779 --> 09:25.869
Okay, well, I don't want
anyone to get hurt.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.697
Good. Now, you ready to
take a walk with me?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.178
Oh. Uh.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.309
I'm ready to do
more than that.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.441
Okay, seriously?

09:32.484 --> 09:33.529
Yeah. I'm done.
I'm out of here.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.617
You two are a thing, too?

09:34.661 --> 09:35.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.359
Maybe I should do
the groupings from now on?

09:37.402 --> 09:38.882
That's a good idea.
Why don't you do that for me?

09:38.926 --> 09:40.231
Yep. It's time.
Come on.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.801
Somebody called
the fire department?

09:45.933 --> 09:47.630
He's over here.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.593
Grab a tool bag
and blankets.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.856
Dammit, Patricia,
did you call 911?

09:55.899 --> 09:57.553
I said I'd figure it out!

09:57.597 --> 09:59.207
Yeah, I'd like to see
you try, Houdini.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.121
How can I get in
the house?

10:00.164 --> 10:01.035
Yeah, I'll take you.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.212
Hey, I'm Maya.
What's your name?

10:04.255 --> 10:05.909
- Tony.
- How are you feeling?

10:05.953 --> 10:08.129
Uh, a little hungover.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.434
Tony, it looks like
you were bleeding.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.566
Do you remember
cutting yourself?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.655
Ohh. I was piss drunk
last night,

10:12.699 --> 10:15.223
tried to break into my own house
through the doggy door.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.528
How much do you think
I remember?

10:18.269 --> 10:20.968
Here he is.
The light of my life.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.231
Enough, Trish.
I feel like an idiot as is.

10:23.274 --> 10:24.928
Oh, well.
If it walks like a duck

10:24.972 --> 10:26.408
and it quacks like a duck...

10:26.451 --> 10:27.757
How you doing? I'm Robert.

10:27.801 --> 10:28.932
Hey.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.543
Now, uh...
Ohh.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.851
...do you feel any --
any tingling in your arm?

10:34.895 --> 10:37.201
I did when I woke up, but I --
I don't feel anything now.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.029
Okay, well, that's probably
because you slept on it

10:39.073 --> 10:41.031
so the circulation's
cut off.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.859
Here we go.
Let's remove this.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.992
I'd have chewed my own
damn arms off

10:45.035 --> 10:46.428
if it meant getting out
of here.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.082
Why didn't you
do that 10 years ago?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.998
Because my mouth was filled with
all the crap you made me eat!

10:51.041 --> 10:52.042
Oh... Okay, okay.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.522
Uh, Bishop?!

10:53.565 --> 10:55.655
- You got the cordless?!
- Yeah, I got it.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.134
- Let's get him out of here.
- Alright.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.571
Hey, do I get to pick which
half of him stays here?

10:59.615 --> 11:01.835
Oh, real nice, Trish.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.011
Okay.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.275
This is obviously
a waste of time.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.842
It's a joke to them.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.279
Well, there are always growing
pains with this kind of thing.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.672
So we're supposed to just
go through the motions

11:12.715 --> 11:14.369
and then, boom,
they're certified?

11:14.412 --> 11:15.587
No.

11:15.631 --> 11:16.937
We are supposed to show them
how it's done,

11:16.980 --> 11:18.852
mistakes and all.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.071
This is just day one.
They'll get there.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.377
If they can stop
for five minutes

11:22.420 --> 11:24.161
with their
romantic psychodramas.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.642
Well...

11:26.686 --> 11:28.470
Okay.

11:28.513 --> 11:29.732
Alright.

11:29.776 --> 11:35.346
Um, next up, let's have
Gibson and...Maddox.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.045
- Hey!
- I'm pretty sure you two
are not romantically involved.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.394
- Correct?
- I don't know.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.352
I've heard stories
about Gibson.

11:41.396 --> 11:44.355
Okay. Uh, Jack,
you work in an office,

11:44.399 --> 11:46.706
and your co-worker, Dan,

11:46.749 --> 11:48.620
has locked himself
in the conference room.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.013
Uh, why?

11:50.057 --> 11:51.580
That -- That's what Jack
has to figure out.

11:51.623 --> 11:52.973
I don't get it. Uh.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.626
Have I called 911?

11:54.670 --> 11:57.325
Okay, alright. Um.
I'm gonna be the responder.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.370
Awesome.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.068
Dude.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.115
Uh, Dan, come on out, man.
We're all worried about you.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.248
Hey, uh, Dan. I'm with
the Seattle Fire Department.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.076
Did you call
the friggin' cops, man?

12:09.119 --> 12:10.686
Just to check on you, man.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.688
I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.037
I'm freaking out, man!

12:16.431 --> 12:17.737
What -- is he on drugs?

12:19.564 --> 12:21.653
It's often hard to know
if the patient

12:21.697 --> 12:25.135
is intoxicated or suffering
from mental illness, or both.

12:25.179 --> 12:28.704
Okay? Treat everyone
with empathy.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.401
- Miller.
- Hmm?

12:31.489 --> 12:33.013
Alright.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.275
Hey, Dan.
Aaah.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.581
I'm Dean. Dean Miller.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.800
Your co-workers
are telling me

12:37.844 --> 12:40.324
that you had
a stressful day here?

12:40.368 --> 12:42.979
- Yeah.
- I remember when I was
in finance,

12:43.023 --> 12:46.809
it felt like some days were
more stressful than other days?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.594
Is that
what you're f-feeling now?

12:49.638 --> 12:53.511
I am a golden god!

12:53.555 --> 12:54.948
Okay, look, man,
if you're not gonna

12:54.991 --> 12:55.992
take this seriously,
you don't have --

12:56.036 --> 12:57.646
I'm a serious
golden god!

12:57.689 --> 12:59.082
Miller,
he's either on drugs

12:59.126 --> 13:00.692
or having
a psychotic break.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.129
You know, I feel like I'm about
to have a psychotic break.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.826
Okay, alright.
Let's take a breather.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.523
Back here in 10, people.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.396
Looks like you're gonna
owe me a six-pack, captain.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.311
Pull it together, 23.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.530
I don't wanna have to
come back here again.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.576
Miller, they will
get there.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.578
Look, they already know
how to do this.

13:16.621 --> 13:17.797
We just need to
teach the language.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.276
I know. I know.
It's just that I'm --

13:19.320 --> 13:21.104
I'm not a teacher.
No.

13:21.148 --> 13:23.628
<i>I'm</i> a teacher.

13:23.672 --> 13:24.716
You're a leader.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.949
Alright, so what are you
gonna tell him?

13:39.993 --> 13:42.691
I'm not gonna cover for my dad
with my poor mom,

13:42.734 --> 13:45.520
who's probably at home
writing a poem about him.

13:45.563 --> 13:46.869
Oh, you know, she sent me
some of her pieces.

13:46.913 --> 13:47.739
They're actually
really good.

13:49.567 --> 13:50.612
Not the point. Right.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.572
I mean, I don't know.
Should I tell her?

13:54.616 --> 13:55.922
It's been so long,

13:55.965 --> 13:57.662
I feel like he's never
gonna be honest with her

13:57.706 --> 13:59.142
and somebody should be.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.752
That's not really
your truth to tell.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.798
I know. I know. I know.
But it's like,

14:02.842 --> 14:04.887
if he were in some
boring, hetero affair,

14:04.931 --> 14:06.454
I wouldn't think twice
about telling my mom.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.716
Well, that's just it.
He's not.

14:07.759 --> 14:08.891
- He's in the closet.
- Yeah, but --

14:08.935 --> 14:10.501
Travis.

14:10.545 --> 14:11.676
It's not that simple.

14:11.720 --> 14:15.855
So, uh...
Teresa's...?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.204
I was playacting.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.036
She was my first girlfriend.
Teresa.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.907
Oh.
Was crazier than a --

14:24.951 --> 14:26.343
Oh, you know what? Actually,
I'm gonna stop you there.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.693
You know I don't love it
when men call women crazy.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.217
She spent two months
in a psych ward.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.871
No, I thought that
was Allie.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.655
- Her, too.
- Oh, yeah.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.352
Hm.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.878
I'm sorry, you have two
girlfriends who were committed?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.880
What can I say?
I have a type.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.408
Explain to me again
what you thought you were doing.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.932
I was drunk, okay?

14:49.976 --> 14:51.412
I couldn't find my key
and --

14:51.455 --> 14:53.980
And you thought maybe
you'd squeeze your ass

14:54.023 --> 14:55.372
in through our dog door.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.461
Our dog died 5 years ago.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.941
He still won't let me
get a new one.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.074
I didn't want to wake you up.
You could say thank you.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.510
No.
Sullivan,
this frame is decorative.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.425
We're gonna have to
reposition him for removal.

15:04.468 --> 15:05.513
Okay.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.950
Patricia, um,
could you maybe, uh,

15:07.994 --> 15:09.909
help Lieutenant Bishop on
the other side of the door?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.649
Yeah, fine.

15:11.693 --> 15:12.650
I can't stand the smell
of last night's Scotch

15:12.694 --> 15:13.956
on his breath anymore.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.176
Oh...

15:16.219 --> 15:18.874
You know, we used to
actually like each other.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.267
I mean,
I don't know what happened.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.747
Somewhere along the line,
it got like this. Ohh.

15:22.791 --> 15:23.966
It's okay.
Oh, thanks.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.272
- Listen, Tony.
- Mnh.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.404
We're gonna try
lifting you...Mm.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.277
...and when we do, you're gonna
have to try and move that arm

15:30.320 --> 15:31.452
out from underneath you.
Okay?

15:31.495 --> 15:33.019
Yep.
Alright.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.237
Bishop? On three.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.456
Copy.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.154
One. Two. Three.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.245
Okay, come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

15:43.812 --> 15:44.769
You can do it.
You can do it.

15:44.813 --> 15:45.945
- Nope. No.
- Okay, okay.
Okay, sir.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.208
It's stuck, man.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.600
Bishop, we're gonna
have to cut him out.

15:49.644 --> 15:50.340
Copy.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.907
You hear that, Tony?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.475
They got to cut our door.
You gonna buy a new one?

15:54.518 --> 15:57.086
It's times like this I'm glad
we didn't have kids.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.870
They'd be ashamed.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.308
Look,
when we got married,

16:01.351 --> 16:02.787
we both said
we didn't want them,

16:02.831 --> 16:05.094
and then I changed my mind,
but it was too late.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.009
It wasn't always
too late, Trish.

16:07.053 --> 16:10.926
Yes, it was, Tony!
Yes, it was!

16:10.970 --> 16:13.755
Because you are
a walking farce.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.279
You are a drunk,
and you're not father material,

16:16.323 --> 16:17.411
and we both know it!

16:17.454 --> 16:19.021
Maybe if you'd told me
you wanted kids,

16:19.065 --> 16:20.936
I-I-I could have
turned it around.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.243
Oh, says the man
stuck in the doggy door.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.549
Oh!
- Son of a bitch, that burns!
- Alright.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.029
That means there's
circulation, Tony.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.858
- That's good news.
- Ohh! Fantastic.

16:29.901 --> 16:30.728
Okay. One more.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.034
Aah!

16:32.078 --> 16:33.949
She didn't tell me
until last year

16:33.993 --> 16:35.603
that she'd wanted kids
all this time,

16:35.646 --> 16:37.170
but never said anything.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.041
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with that?

16:39.085 --> 16:40.869
I mean, everything works
for me down there,

16:40.912 --> 16:44.133
but she had cancer last year --
they took it all out.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.526
So what do I do
with that?

16:45.569 --> 16:46.440
Starting the cut!

17:10.072 --> 17:11.856
Here we go.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.034
- Tony!
- Okay, okay,
but watch your head.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.252
- Oh!
- Watch your head.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.778
Son of a bitch.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.390
What happened?

17:23.433 --> 17:24.608
Ah, that hurts.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.001
Tony, what happened?!

17:26.045 --> 17:27.263
How the hell did
that happen?

17:28.656 --> 17:30.179
Aah. I don't know.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.485
What is that --
a bottle opener?

17:31.528 --> 17:34.009
I don't know.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.316
Dispatch, this is Engine 19
requesting an aid car

17:36.359 --> 17:37.882
to 3667 Egre Road.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.101
Mnh.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.973
Oh, my God.
Was that in him?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.383
You doing okay
over there at 23?

18:00.427 --> 18:02.864
Ugh. Surviving.

18:02.907 --> 18:06.302
Ruiz makes it feel less lonely,
but it's not the same.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.217
Things good here?

18:08.261 --> 18:10.654
Yeah, I mean, other than
you not being here

18:10.698 --> 18:12.221
and Beckett
being our captain...

18:12.265 --> 18:13.614
...uh...

18:13.657 --> 18:15.311
yeah, it's like normal.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.009
So things are just fine
with Sullivan?
Yeah, go ahead.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.054
Like,
everyone forgave him?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.969
Mm.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.710
Well, he's kind of the reason
you guys are all here today.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.060
He agreed to let the SFD
capitalize on

18:25.104 --> 18:26.975
his little Fire Zaddy moment,
and in turn,

18:27.018 --> 18:29.847
Miller gets his department-wide
training approved.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.675
I'm pretty sure there's
an ulterior motive.

18:38.943 --> 18:42.033
Um, I'm gonna say something
to you right now,

18:42.077 --> 18:44.427
and, uh, you're probably
gonna get mad,

18:44.471 --> 18:45.428
but, uh, hell with it.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.604
Uh...

18:49.998 --> 18:52.261
I think what you did
was messed up.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.264
Excuse me?
Yeah.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.180
I'm a stranger in my own house
because of him.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.573
Maya --
Would be the first
to tell you

18:59.616 --> 19:01.966
that she got demoted
because she defied McCallister.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.968
Have you asked her how she feels
about this situation lately?

19:04.012 --> 19:06.014
Have you talked to her?

19:06.057 --> 19:08.538
It's like...

19:08.582 --> 19:12.847
you find things to use
as excuses to cut and run.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.196
Well, don't you?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.024
You do.
Uh, look, you did it with me,

19:16.067 --> 19:18.592
you did it with Ryan,
and now your husband.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.637
I don't look for excuses.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.771
Robert is overbearing,
stubborn,

19:23.814 --> 19:25.468
overprotective to the point
of patronizing,

19:25.512 --> 19:28.384
and he refuses to admit
when he's wrong.

19:28.428 --> 19:29.820
Like your dad?

19:29.864 --> 19:31.300
Who you worshiped,
right?

19:31.344 --> 19:32.606
Who we all worshiped.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.912
But, I mean, you just left,

19:34.956 --> 19:36.262
didn't say a thing,
kind of like your...

19:39.178 --> 19:41.832
Like -- Like who?
Like my mom?

19:43.138 --> 19:44.618
Not exactly
like your mom, no.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.359
Wow.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.882
Wow.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.101
Andy. Just --
No.

20:03.593 --> 20:07.510
You know what I do
when I feel overwhelmed?

20:07.554 --> 20:09.991
I take a walk, you know?

20:10.034 --> 20:13.560
Go to the park
and get some ice cream.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.823
I don't like ice cream.

20:15.866 --> 20:16.650
Uh...

20:19.609 --> 20:20.871
Okay, um...

20:20.915 --> 20:23.961
Are you
a salty food guy?

20:24.005 --> 20:25.006
Yeah.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.137
Okay, well,

20:26.181 --> 20:29.924
maybe a bag of chips
is your ice cream.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.145
Yeah, so, uh, what do you say
you come on out of there

20:34.189 --> 20:38.715
and we take a walk to the park
together?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.283
Okay.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.285
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.856
That was great, you two.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.164
Yes!

20:53.208 --> 20:55.297
Now, did you see
how he kept him talking

20:55.341 --> 20:57.125
but never pushed?

20:57.168 --> 20:59.954
He really engaged him and was
sensitive to his physicality

20:59.997 --> 21:01.956
and matched it where he could.

21:01.999 --> 21:04.306
He empathized and validated
his feelings,

21:04.350 --> 21:07.048
and presented an alternative
plan of action.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.093
See, empathized and validated
his feelings.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.921
Yeah, it's not very subtle,
but I got it.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.749
Hey, maybe next time
you accuse me

21:12.793 --> 21:14.229
of forgetting to
buy batteries,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.057
you could just present
an alternative plan of action.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.450
Okay, both of you --

21:17.493 --> 21:18.755
<i>
Crisis One requested</i>

21:18.799 --> 21:21.323
<i>to 900 block of North Wilton.</i>

21:25.371 --> 21:27.024
Uh, Jack.
Yeah.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.330
You didn't get
a fair shot earlier.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.375
You want to try it
in the field?

21:29.418 --> 21:30.898
What, like now?
For real? Yeah.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.029
Yeah, for real.
Okay. Yeah.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.857
Whoo!

21:38.688 --> 21:40.168
Tony, you big idiot.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.996
Do not die.
You cannot die!

21:42.039 --> 21:43.389
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I need the space.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.391
Lungs sound good.
Pulse ox is 99%.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.829
Tony, if you die by a
stab wound from a bottle opener

21:48.872 --> 21:50.874
because your drunk ass tried
to crawl in through

21:50.918 --> 21:52.746
our dead dog's door,
I swear to God --

21:52.789 --> 21:54.400
You'll what? Kill me?

21:54.443 --> 21:56.053
Ma'am,
he's gonna be fine.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.490
On three.
One, two, three. Up.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.492
I should have told you

21:59.535 --> 22:01.015
when I changed my mind
and I wanted kids.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.496
I shoulda given you
a chance to clean up.

22:03.539 --> 22:04.671
No. Listen to me.

22:06.281 --> 22:09.110
If I was gonna clean up,
I woulda done it for you, babe.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.939
I couldn't. I tried.

22:11.982 --> 22:13.114
Alright, let's go.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.508
It's okay.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.952
Dad, hey.

22:24.995 --> 22:28.434
<i> Hey, um, so, what's this text
I got from you? </i>

22:28.477 --> 22:30.131
Yeah, well -- <i>"I'm not gonna
lie for you"? </i>

22:30.174 --> 22:31.698
Yeah. Just what it says.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.613
Dad, the whole point of texting
is to not have to call.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.745
<i> I didn't ask you to
lie for me, Travis. </i>

22:35.789 --> 22:37.530
Right, but that was
the implication.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.314
"She thinks it's a conference,
by the way."

22:39.358 --> 22:40.881
<i> I just wanted you to
have the information </i>

22:40.924 --> 22:42.143
<i> so that you didn't --So what?</i>

22:42.186 --> 22:44.841
So I didn't accidentally
tell her the truth?

22:44.885 --> 22:48.062
<i>
I never meant --Okay, Dad. Dad. </i>

22:48.105 --> 22:49.368
I have given you space,

22:49.411 --> 22:52.022
and I know that
it's not my truth to tell,

22:52.066 --> 22:54.547
but that's my mom
and you're lying to her

22:54.590 --> 22:56.070
and possibly putting her
at risk.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.463
<i> Kyle and I are safe.</i>

22:57.506 --> 22:59.726
Dad, you know
that's not the point!

23:02.163 --> 23:03.817
I gotta go, okay?

23:03.860 --> 23:05.514
I'm in the middle of
crisis intervention training,

23:05.558 --> 23:07.429
and I clearly have
more to learn.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.400
That's affirmative.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.576
Crisis One on scene.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.927
- Hi.
- Come on, man.
I called the police.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.015
Well, they called us.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.669
Can you tell us
the situation?

23:29.712 --> 23:31.366
Yeah, this crazy kid
won't get off the bus,

23:31.410 --> 23:33.107
and this is the last stop
on my route.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.978
It's the end of my shift.
I can't go back to the terminal

23:35.022 --> 23:36.240
with him still inside.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.939
Well, he seems upset,
- not crazy.
- Mm.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.115
Look, I'm new to this route,
alright?

23:41.158 --> 23:42.508
And I don't know
this kid.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.335
And when I tried to wake him,
he freaked out on me,

23:44.379 --> 23:46.425
so I'm gonna go with crazy.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.123
Okay, well...Okay, so this is no different
from any other call

23:49.166 --> 23:50.994
where we deal with
an erratic patient.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.082
You ready? You got this.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.606
Y-- Okay. Yeah.

23:53.649 --> 23:54.998
You got it.
Alright.

23:59.699 --> 24:00.961
Hey.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.658
Hey, buddy.
I'm -- I'm Jack.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.620
Uh, Jack Gibson.
I'm a...

24:07.663 --> 24:09.273
Okay. Hey.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.187
Buddy, y-your hand
is kind of --

24:10.231 --> 24:11.188
- Don't touch me!
- Okay.

24:11.232 --> 24:12.451
Do not touch me!
I'm sorry.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.626
The driver tried to
take my bag,

24:13.669 --> 24:15.062
but I wouldn't let him
because it's my bag.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.455
I-I fell taking it back,

24:16.498 --> 24:19.501
and I cut my my hand
on the back of a seat.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.504
Alright. Okay. Um...
W-What's your name?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.071
Myles Anthony Trudeau.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.942
That's a good,
strong name.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.554
In fact, my -- my friend,
her dad's name is Anthony.

24:28.597 --> 24:29.772
He makes the best pierogis.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.687
My name is Myles.

24:31.731 --> 24:34.516
Right. Myles.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.301
Myles, y-your hand
is bleeding pretty bad.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.477
Are you sure
I can't just --

24:38.520 --> 24:40.348
- Don't! Don't touch me!
- Okay. Okay. Alright.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.392
- Get away from me!
- Okay.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.003
- Do not touch me!
- Okay.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.222
Get away from me!
- Get away from me!
- I'm stepping back.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.397
- Get away from me!
- I'm stepping back.

24:46.441 --> 24:47.877
Get away from me!
Okay.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.923
Do not touch me!
Do not touch me!

24:54.971 --> 24:57.017
Dispatch,
this is Engine 19.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.975
Patient is being transported
to Seattle Pres

24:59.019 --> 25:00.107
by Aid Car 88.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.804
We're heading back to
the station now.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.066
<i>
Copy, Engine 19.</i>

25:05.852 --> 25:07.506
You think Carina's gonna
hate me like that one day

25:07.549 --> 25:08.594
if I never want to
have kids?

25:11.031 --> 25:13.120
How is that funny?
It's not.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.688
It's just, here I am,
thinking about my own marriage

25:15.731 --> 25:18.691
based on that
hot mess of a couple,

25:18.734 --> 25:20.475
and you're over there,
thinking about yours.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.695
It's just...

25:22.738 --> 25:26.742
Yeah, we're all just...The hero of our own story.

25:26.786 --> 25:29.179
Yeah.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.399
Something Andy said to me
the night of your wedding.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.579
Andy's my best friend,
but no one really knows

25:37.623 --> 25:39.059
what it's like
in another marriage

25:39.102 --> 25:41.583
except for
the people in it.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.412
You know,
all I'm gonna say is that,

25:44.455 --> 25:48.111
for the past two years,
I have watched her

25:48.155 --> 25:50.679
twist herself up
about you.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.855
First, you were
the forbidden romance,

25:52.899 --> 25:54.944
then you were
the whirlwind romance,

25:54.988 --> 25:56.598
then you were
the tragic romance.

25:56.642 --> 26:00.428
And now we're the
stuck-in-a-doggy-door romance.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.478
You're saying I should
let her go.

26:09.045 --> 26:13.484
I am just saying that I wish
my friend could be happy again.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.538
It's Thursday.
I go there every Thursday,

26:23.582 --> 26:25.453
and his mom always makes
enchiladas.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.760
I-I-I don't know
where I am.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.110
I-I'm supposed to be
at Trevor's for dinner,

26:30.153 --> 26:31.415
because it's Thursday.

26:31.459 --> 26:34.070
Y-You like your, uh,
- your routines, huh?
- Yes.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.159
I wake up every day
at30 in the morning,

26:36.203 --> 26:37.204
and then I make breakfast.

26:37.247 --> 26:38.422
And then after breakfast,

26:38.466 --> 26:40.120
I like to take a walk
in my neighborhood.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.382
Mondays, Tuesdays,
and Fridays,

26:41.425 --> 26:43.732
I go to work
at the grocery store.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.647
I'm a bagger.
Once, I won the store contest

26:45.691 --> 26:47.170
for bagging
the best and the fastest,

26:47.214 --> 26:49.346
which was actually
pretty cool.

26:49.390 --> 26:52.001
On Wednesdays,
I-I go to socialization club,

26:52.045 --> 26:53.263
and on Thursdays,

26:53.307 --> 26:54.830
I'm -- I'm supposed to be
at Trevor's house.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.832
This is not Trevor's stop.
This is not Trevor's stop.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.442
- This is not Trevor's stop.
- So your routines...

26:58.486 --> 27:01.315
This is not Trevor's stop....t-they help you
a lot, right?

27:01.358 --> 27:02.621
Yeah.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.711
My -- My teachers tell me
that keeping a routine

27:05.754 --> 27:07.800
and staying busy
will help with my autism

27:07.843 --> 27:09.540
because it will occupy
my mind and it'll give me

27:09.584 --> 27:10.933
something
to look forward to.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.718
That's awesome. You know,
my teachers always said

27:12.761 --> 27:14.284
they expected to see me
on the00 news.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.376
Ahh. They thought
I was a bad kid.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.595
A-Are --
Are you a bad person?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.118
Oh, no.
Bud, I'm sorry.

27:22.162 --> 27:25.295
Um, I-I'm a helper.
I'm a firefighter.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.648
Hey, um, what --
what time is your, uh --

27:29.691 --> 27:31.475
your dinner with Trevor?30.

27:31.519 --> 27:32.955
30.
Mm-hmm.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.696
What do you say
we clean your hand up

27:34.740 --> 27:36.742
and we'll just drive you?

27:36.785 --> 27:38.961
Right, you don't like to
be touched. Um...

27:41.050 --> 27:42.965
What if I showed you --

27:43.009 --> 27:45.402
if I showed you how to
clean your own hand,

27:45.446 --> 27:48.710
and then no touching --

27:48.754 --> 27:50.843
would that be okay?

27:52.801 --> 27:55.717
Yeah? Okay. Yeah?

27:55.761 --> 27:57.980
Uh, Hughes, could you please
bring the medical bag?

28:00.156 --> 28:01.592
Why did your teacher
think you were bad?

28:03.682 --> 28:07.381
Uh, well,
I didn't come to class a lot,

28:07.424 --> 28:08.948
because, uh,
I was embarrassed.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.167
Why?

28:11.211 --> 28:14.867
Because I was, uh,
homeless often,

28:14.910 --> 28:17.913
and, uh, I usually would wear
the same clothes

28:17.957 --> 28:21.264
and never have enough
supplies for class.

28:22.657 --> 28:27.270
But there was this one
really nice teacher.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.751
Yeah, she, um --

28:29.795 --> 28:31.840
she always brought me food
on most days,

28:31.884 --> 28:33.102
so that I could eat,

28:33.146 --> 28:36.758
and, uh, she just, uh...

28:36.802 --> 28:38.107
didn't judge me.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.242
Kids were mean to me, too.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.507
Some people think
that I'm weird

28:46.550 --> 28:48.770
just 'cause I'm different.

28:50.467 --> 28:54.645
No.
That's...not true.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.996
Do -- Do you have
a Dalmatian?
Uh...

28:57.039 --> 28:59.781
Did you know that Dalmatians
were firehouse dogs?

28:59.825 --> 29:01.087
Well, they became
firehouse dogs

29:01.130 --> 29:02.479
because they got along
with horses,

29:02.523 --> 29:03.611
and when firefighting
started,

29:03.654 --> 29:06.135
the trucks were
horse-drawn carriages.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.094
No. That's -- That's awesome.
No, I didn't know that.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.095
Uh, I wish
we had a dog.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.010
Dalmatian.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.273
- Dalmatian.
- Good?

29:14.622 --> 29:15.884
Alrighty.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.757
Do you mind if I put
some supplies right here?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.280
Would that be alright?

29:20.323 --> 29:21.847
Yeah? Okay.

29:23.936 --> 29:27.940
I will show you
how to fix your hand.

29:27.983 --> 29:30.812
So, to disinfect the hand,

29:30.856 --> 29:34.773
first, we need to bust open
one of these bad boys,

29:34.816 --> 29:37.471
and then rub --
don't scrub --

29:37.514 --> 29:39.299
you know,
at the back of the hand,

29:39.342 --> 29:40.953
and then, if it starts
to sting a little bit,

29:40.996 --> 29:42.998
that just means
it's working, alright?

31:05.733 --> 31:07.909
23 did not suck today.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.084
Yeah.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.781
Even Maddox and Barnes
showed empathy,

31:10.825 --> 31:11.957
and I don't think
either of them

31:12.000 --> 31:13.828
can tell you
what "empathy" means, so...

31:13.872 --> 31:15.177
that's a win.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.920
You asked them to step up
and they did.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.836
We have trainings with
88, 7, and 42 set up.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.491
This program you created,
it's a success.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.928
Ah, I just made them
participate.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.452
Actually, it was Sullivan
who got all of this approved.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.324
If it wasn't --
Uh, Miller?

31:31.367 --> 31:33.892
Do you know how to win?

31:33.935 --> 31:35.371
Today was a success.

31:59.221 --> 32:02.094
I'd heard about
your transfer.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.705
It was bold...

32:04.748 --> 32:07.273
standing up to McCallister
like that with Bishop.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.929
He'd be proud of you.

32:14.454 --> 32:17.544
You know, Miller was always
secretly my dad's favorite --

32:17.587 --> 32:19.720
bullheaded, stubborn...Mm.

32:19.763 --> 32:22.766
...too smart for his own good
- sometimes.
- Yeah.

32:22.810 --> 32:26.335
But his capacity for --
for good?

32:26.379 --> 32:29.034
For -- For change?

32:29.077 --> 32:30.905
He saw that potential.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.474
He'd be really proud
of what he's doing.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.132
So, you and Sullivan.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.916
Ah.
You gonna talk about that?

32:41.960 --> 32:45.572
Yes,
you and your annoying habit

32:45.615 --> 32:47.574
of burrowing
right into the truth.

32:47.617 --> 32:50.446
Are you separated?
Divorced?

32:51.752 --> 32:54.885
Not yet.
He has the papers.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.322
They were served here,
on shift,

32:56.365 --> 32:58.715
which was an accident,
but he hates me for it.

33:00.456 --> 33:04.243
I mean, Gibson said something
that really pissed me off,

33:04.286 --> 33:06.375
but he might have a point,
which is incredibly annoying

33:06.419 --> 33:08.029
because --Because it's Gibson.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.510
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

33:10.553 --> 33:11.902
What did he say?

33:13.600 --> 33:15.776
He said that --

33:15.819 --> 33:18.518
He said that Robert and I
are like my parents.

33:18.561 --> 33:22.522
That I, specifically,
am like my mom,

33:22.565 --> 33:25.525
who walked out on us
when I was a kid.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.050
I thought she was dead,
but she wasn't.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.661
She kind of just ghosted us,
and I --

33:31.705 --> 33:33.881
After what happened

33:33.924 --> 33:35.622
with Robert going behind
all of our backs,

33:35.665 --> 33:38.407
especially <i>my</i> back,
I left.

33:39.669 --> 33:43.499
I didn't say a word.
I just -- I just left.

33:43.543 --> 33:46.850
And then, 10 months later,
I filed.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.288
Do you blame him
for your transfer?

33:49.331 --> 33:51.203
I don't <i>not</i> blame him.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.380
Alright, give it to me,
Diane.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.338
I know you have a take.
You always have a take.

33:57.339 --> 33:58.993
Okay.

34:00.603 --> 34:04.216
You went from zero to 100
overnight.

34:04.259 --> 34:07.306
When I met you, you told me
he made you feel electric...Mm.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.525
...like no man had ever
made you feel before.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.614
The last time
you and I spoke,

34:11.658 --> 34:13.268
I saw the love you had
for him,

34:13.312 --> 34:14.878
the fear and concern

34:14.922 --> 34:18.099
for his mental well-being
and his physical safety.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.493
Feelings like that
don't just turn off.

34:20.536 --> 34:23.104
Then how come
all I feel now is anger?

34:23.148 --> 34:25.367
Red, hot,
all-consuming anger?

34:25.411 --> 34:27.152
Well, usually when a feeling
is that intense...

34:27.195 --> 34:29.589
Just -- just say it.

34:29.632 --> 34:30.981
Hysterical, historical.

34:32.505 --> 34:35.899
Okay. Okay, now you're gonna
have to explain it.

34:35.943 --> 34:38.119
When you feel
hysterical --

34:38.163 --> 34:41.340
heightened, incredibly intense,
overwhelming emotions --

34:41.383 --> 34:43.211
a rage,
a need to run away,

34:43.255 --> 34:46.345
a sudden need to never
speak to someone again,

34:46.388 --> 34:49.130
it's often because something
unprocessed from your past

34:49.174 --> 34:51.045
has been triggered.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.917
So when you're hysterical,
it's historical.

34:53.961 --> 34:56.746
So you're saying
Gibson was right.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.835
No.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.663
No.

35:00.707 --> 35:04.493
I'm saying...
talk to someone.

35:04.537 --> 35:07.279
Robert, a counselor,
a counselor with Robert.

35:07.322 --> 35:08.541
In my experience,

35:08.584 --> 35:11.544
both professionally
and personally speaking,

35:11.587 --> 35:15.461
most people don't go from
electric to divorced.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.392
Why are you scavenging
19's kitchen?

35:33.435 --> 35:34.915
Because their captain
didn't feed us.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.395
I told you there was
pizza in there somewhere.

35:36.438 --> 35:37.744
Which there is not.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.528
Hey, have you guys
seen Sullivan?

35:39.572 --> 35:41.008
I think
he's in the gym.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.314
Hey.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.751
Hey.

35:44.794 --> 35:47.493
You, uh...

35:47.536 --> 35:48.885
You want to hang out again?

35:48.929 --> 35:52.454
No. No, I don't.
I really don't.

35:52.498 --> 35:53.890
Wow.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.676
Well, uh...

35:56.719 --> 35:58.286
- Way to soften the blow.
- I-I'm sorry.

35:58.330 --> 36:03.465
I -- I'm -- I'm hurting people
a lot these days,

36:03.509 --> 36:04.771
and I don't mean to.

36:04.814 --> 36:05.902
Sorry, I didn't mean
how it sounded.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.340
No, I-I get it.
I get it.

36:08.383 --> 36:12.692
I'll just...
show myself out.

36:23.877 --> 36:26.793
So, um, this unstable
ex-girlfriend thing?

36:26.836 --> 36:28.229
Ahh, okay.I'm sorry.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.840
Okay, I knew you weren't
gonna just let that go.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.278
Well, you said
you have a type.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.670
Had. I said "had."

36:34.714 --> 36:36.977
No, you said "have."Well, I meant "had."

36:37.020 --> 36:39.284
Okay, well, um,
I'm not unstable.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.417
Well, you're being
a little bit right now.

36:42.461 --> 36:43.505
Seriously?

36:43.549 --> 36:45.115
I'm -- I'm kid--
I'm kidding.

36:45.159 --> 36:48.728
Listen, okay?
I spent my 20s thinking

36:48.771 --> 36:51.774
that all the drama
and the hours-long fights

36:51.818 --> 36:54.647
and the hot and cold, that,
you know -- that that was love.

36:54.690 --> 36:55.865
I didn't think it was real

36:55.909 --> 36:57.606
if it didn't make you
want to kill yourself.

36:57.650 --> 36:58.912
Well, yeah.
I blame Leo and Claire

36:58.955 --> 37:02.350
in "Romeo + Juliet."Same. Same, I swear.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.619
Vic, you are the first person
I've been with who gets me.

37:11.403 --> 37:14.406
You know, who doesn't make me
try to prove my love every day,

37:14.449 --> 37:17.931
and just --
and just wants me to be happy.

37:17.974 --> 37:20.847
We're so similar.
We just...

37:20.890 --> 37:22.457
We fit.

37:27.723 --> 37:31.771
And all my past relationships,
they were just...

37:31.814 --> 37:33.163
I don't know.
They were all so serious.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.513
You know?

37:34.556 --> 37:36.993
Not in the "where is this going"
kind of way,

37:37.037 --> 37:39.648
but, like...
I don't know.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.302
I like to make jokes.

37:41.346 --> 37:44.131
I like to see the --
the silver lining.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.308
It doesn't mean
I'm not a serious person,

37:47.352 --> 37:50.529
it just means I don't take
myself too seriously, you know?

37:50.572 --> 37:51.791
And all my exes were...

37:54.750 --> 37:56.491
They were not that.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.191
What?

38:02.802 --> 38:04.412
I just love you.

38:04.456 --> 38:07.807
Like, a lot, lot.

38:16.642 --> 38:17.643
Whoa, okay!
Oh.

38:17.686 --> 38:19.079
- Alright.
- Sorry. Sorry, Miller.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.254
Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.
No.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.822
PDA at work
is strictly forbidden.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.214
Right.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.782
Uh, also, sorry, uh...
sorry about this morning.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.871
No. No. No.
- It's, uh -- It's fine.
- It was...

38:28.915 --> 38:30.308
- Yeah, sorry, man.
- It's cool.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.049
I just didn't know that
you'd be making out here,

38:33.093 --> 38:35.661
where...
everybody walks.

38:36.531 --> 38:37.706
Alright.

38:37.750 --> 38:38.620
Oops.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.672
Hey. You alright?

38:47.977 --> 38:49.718
Since when do we make out
in the lounge?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.330
Vic and Theo, huh?

38:52.373 --> 38:53.896
I'm going to sleep.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.203
Hey, um, I got a call
the other day

38:56.246 --> 38:57.378
from my friend in Oakland.

38:57.422 --> 38:58.814
She's working with
the city council

38:58.858 --> 39:01.469
to try and create a program
exactly like Crisis One.

39:01.513 --> 39:02.905
- Dude, that is dope.
- Yeah.

39:02.949 --> 39:05.125
Every city really needs
a program like this, man.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.344
Well, yeah,
except but she can't

39:06.387 --> 39:07.997
wrap her head around
the logistics, you know?

39:08.041 --> 39:09.869
She needs someone
who knows how it works,

39:09.912 --> 39:11.914
on the business end <i>
and</i> the implementation end.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.829
She needs someone
who can manage people.

39:13.873 --> 39:16.397
Someone with a --
a business degree, so...

39:17.442 --> 39:19.008
I gave her your number.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.445
You trying to get rid
of me, Warren?

39:20.488 --> 39:22.360
What? No, but I am trying to
help you change the world.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.013
I mean,
look at what you did --

39:24.057 --> 39:26.407
I mean, what you're <i>doing</i> --
it's -- it's huge, man.

39:26.451 --> 39:29.367
It's -- It's -- It's got to
get bigger than just us,

39:29.410 --> 39:31.107
bigger than Seattle.

39:31.151 --> 39:34.110
Plus, you know...

39:34.154 --> 39:35.721
I thought it wouldn't hurt
for you to get away

39:35.764 --> 39:36.983
from this situation
for a little while.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.697
Hi.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.439
Oh, hey.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.223
I was just
looking for you.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.051
I --
I was looking for you.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.099
Robert, I wanted to --Look, uh, no, no, no.
No, please.

40:06.142 --> 40:09.363
Let me just --
Let me speak for a moment.

40:13.149 --> 40:15.761
I love you.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.458
You were the first woman
after Claire

40:17.502 --> 40:18.590
to make me feel
whole again.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.461
You helped me
rediscover myself

40:20.505 --> 40:22.071
as a man
and as a friend and...

40:23.595 --> 40:25.901
...I-I-I know
I made mistakes,

40:25.945 --> 40:28.991
and I'm so sorry
for hurting you,

40:29.035 --> 40:31.820
but I can't be sorry for
trying to rebuild my career.

40:34.562 --> 40:35.563
Um...

40:37.260 --> 40:38.523
So, um...

40:40.786 --> 40:42.222
I signed.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.142
I love you, Andy,
but I can't be

40:49.185 --> 40:50.796
the only one
fighting for us.

40:52.275 --> 40:56.715
I want you to be happy...
and I want to be happy.

40:56.758 --> 40:57.846
Robert --

41:00.458 --> 41:04.244
Herrera. Let's go.
Train's leaving.
