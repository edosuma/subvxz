WEBVTT

00:06.890 --> 00:09.685
E.R. 6x15 "BE PATIENT"

00:11.346 --> 00:14.682
Is he standing on the frozen lake
or in a hut?

00:14.884 --> 00:16.553
It beats me.

00:16.762 --> 00:20.766
- What kind of fish do they catch?
- Yo! Morning.

00:21.641 --> 00:24.562
- He rides that in the winter?
- Damn. Malucci.

00:24.771 --> 00:26.982
- What?
- Conference with Romano.

00:27.149 --> 00:29.651
He admitted a patient.
I forgot my notes.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.988
That'll teach you to sleep over.

00:32.197 --> 00:34.283
See you later.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.083
You should get a U-lock. Somebody's
gonna leave you with no ride.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.338
Tired of scolding me
for not having a helmet?

00:45.505 --> 00:50.177
Dr. Dave, I'd never want to
get between you and brain-death.

00:50.677 --> 00:55.184
Abdominal pain, possible ischemic
bowel, needs a consult.

00:55.392 --> 00:59.188
- Mr. Wyatt's x-rays.
- Good. Could you finish here?

00:59.354 --> 01:02.943
- What's left?
- Mr. Kechevsky, rule out MI.

01:03.152 --> 01:07.324
If someone has the enzyme results,
I would like to follow up.

01:07.532 --> 01:09.159
- Can you handle that?
- Yes.

01:09.326 --> 01:10.368
- That's it?
- Yep.

01:10.577 --> 01:11.620
All right.

01:13.539 --> 01:18.295
ER. Yeah, hang on a second.
Abby, it's for you.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.841
- I answer phones.
- Just helping.

01:22.050 --> 01:24.053
And I appreciate it.

01:26.723 --> 01:29.309
Yes, I did call. Three days ago.

01:30.727 --> 01:34.065
I need to talk to you
about the late payments.

01:35.484 --> 01:36.525
What?

01:38.653 --> 01:40.823
You'll just have to sell them.

01:41.032 --> 01:44.828
I don't care how you do it,
just make the payments.

01:45.037 --> 01:47.748
Just make the payments.

01:47.956 --> 01:48.999
Bye.

01:52.630 --> 01:55.257
- My soon-to-be ex-husband.
- Sounds bad.

01:55.425 --> 01:58.386
He's taken a flyer on
stocks with my money.

01:58.595 --> 02:02.767
- Ow! Maybe they'll go up.
- I'll never see the cash.

02:02.975 --> 02:07.439
I'm leaving before I fall over.
Until next time, ladies.

02:07.647 --> 02:10.485
- Bye.
- Men.

02:15.198 --> 02:17.534
Morning. I forgot some notes.

02:17.743 --> 02:21.122
You look tired.
Were you watching Charlie Rose?

02:21.289 --> 02:22.625
Not exactly.

02:25.794 --> 02:27.631
Morning, Elizabeth.

02:30.301 --> 02:32.470
David came over for breakfast.

02:33.305 --> 02:35.973
In boxers and slippers?

02:36.183 --> 02:37.225
My slippers.

02:39.479 --> 02:41.314
I hope you don't mind.

02:42.107 --> 02:44.359
I thought you were ice fishing.

02:47.237 --> 02:51.077
- I didn't make it.
- I can see that.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.187 --> 03:49.440
- Goodbye, Elizabeth.
- See you.

03:53.527 --> 03:57.909
- Can I freshen your cup?
- I practically drank the whole pot.

03:59.494 --> 04:01.496
So are you amused?

04:02.997 --> 04:04.041
Bemused?

04:05.793 --> 04:08.963
- Shocked? Chagrined?
- That's a start.

04:10.215 --> 04:14.136
- I suppose you think at my age-
- Mother. Please.

04:14.386 --> 04:17.349
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

04:18.309 --> 04:22.103
- I'm old, but I'm not dead.
- His wife is. Recently.

04:22.355 --> 04:26.151
- Then bloody well good for him-
- Mother!

04:28.613 --> 04:33.952
Is it so difficult to imagine two
people being attracted to each other?

04:36.122 --> 04:40.418
Were you using protection?
There are diseases.

04:40.627 --> 04:43.130
- He's diseased?
- That's not the point.

04:43.339 --> 04:46.885
- You really want to discuss this?
- No!

04:49.972 --> 04:52.183
He's my boyfriend's father.

04:52.391 --> 04:55.772
You always worried what people think.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.565
- I did not!
- Yes, you did.

04:58.775 --> 05:01.945
How would you know?
Did the nanny tell you?

05:02.154 --> 05:04.658
Yes, Elizabeth. You were so neglected.

05:04.949 --> 05:06.785
Don't pretend to know me.

05:06.993 --> 05:09.996
I know you better than you think.

05:10.205 --> 05:15.170
I'm just trying to say this could get
very complicated.

05:15.378 --> 05:18.590
Why are you afraid
relationships will go bad?

05:18.840 --> 05:24.223
Perhaps because ours hasn't exactly
gone right. I have to go.

05:27.059 --> 05:29.687
No fair doing paperwork now.

05:29.854 --> 05:33.025
- I'm not on yet.
- Just making us look bad?

05:33.233 --> 05:36.446
I'm doing reviews
for Carter and Lucy.

05:36.655 --> 05:39.825
- Sorry. Need my help?
- I've got it.

05:40.368 --> 05:44.539
I've got an object up the nose
and a hemorrhoids case for you.

05:44.706 --> 05:47.876
I'll be right there.
The CPK was normal.

05:48.127 --> 05:51.381
Good. Good. Discharge him, Abby. Yeah.

05:51.548 --> 05:53.968
He should follow up with Cardiology.

05:54.177 --> 05:57.138
No, I have the night shift all week.

05:57.347 --> 06:00.476
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.

06:03.355 --> 06:04.688
Laura!

06:18.373 --> 06:19.415
Stop!

06:21.251 --> 06:25.589
- It hurts.
- I know. I'm a doctor, I'll help you.

06:26.424 --> 06:29.428
Look at me.
Try to breathe slow and easy.

06:30.262 --> 06:33.808
Now, tell me your name
and where it hurts.

06:34.016 --> 06:36.937
- Laura. My leg.
- Keep your head still.

06:37.813 --> 06:40.149
Do you remove nose piercings?

06:40.358 --> 06:42.694
I put a new stud in the old hole.

06:42.903 --> 06:47.867
Inject two cc's of air into
the foley and pull it back gently.

06:49.620 --> 06:50.913
Bless you.

06:51.121 --> 06:52.956
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

06:53.123 --> 06:56.086
- Can I go?
- In a minute. Hemorrhoids next?

06:56.294 --> 06:59.840
Do the initial work-up,
then find me or Mark.

07:00.633 --> 07:03.677
- You gonna use that thing on me?
- We'll see.

07:03.887 --> 07:05.764
- I'm Abby.
- Ron Perth.

07:05.972 --> 07:10.354
I feel kind of stupid coming in.
I didn't expect to feel great.

07:10.562 --> 07:14.066
I'm still bleeding, from the-
You know, hemorrhoids.

07:14.816 --> 07:18.405
- They were banded just last week?
- Yeah.

07:18.614 --> 07:22.076
- You're pale. How much bleeding?
- Not much.

07:22.284 --> 07:25.956
I fly to Denver at 5 for
my girlfriend's birthday.

07:26.373 --> 07:30.087
Could you give me a cream
to shrink it down?

07:30.253 --> 07:31.295
Sorry.

07:31.504 --> 07:35.217
- I was taking her dancing.
- Just dinner might be better.

07:35.425 --> 07:37.553
- Need a hand?
- Yeah.

07:37.762 --> 07:43.519
Could you order a CBC, Chem-7 and
coags and prep for anoscopy.

07:44.102 --> 07:46.439
- Is that what I think?
- I'll be gentle.

07:46.815 --> 07:48.234
Oh, man.

07:48.526 --> 07:51.278
Where's my mom?
Somebody get my mom!

07:51.529 --> 07:53.072
She's coming, Laura.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.702
I need to cut open your pants now.

07:58.037 --> 08:02.751
- Oh, my God! Is she okay?
- Yes. I'm Dr. Kovac. I called 911.

08:03.293 --> 08:06.589
Be careful.
Her leg is broken and maybe a rib.

08:06.881 --> 08:10.719
- Mom, it hurts!
- Can't you do something?

08:12.429 --> 08:15.100
- Get that lady's broom.
- I'll get it.

08:15.308 --> 08:17.436
- What are you doing?
- Splinting her leg.

08:17.853 --> 08:21.232
- Why?
- I need to check for artery damage.

08:23.068 --> 08:24.277
We...

08:25.905 --> 08:28.908
We heard you can't tell anybody
anything we say.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.578
That depends on what you tell me.

08:34.707 --> 08:35.750
It's about...

08:37.294 --> 08:38.503
Sex?

08:39.128 --> 08:42.634
If there's no abuse
and the guys are under 18...

08:42.842 --> 08:45.053
...then I can't tell anyone.

08:45.303 --> 08:47.223
- You can't tell our parents?
- No.

08:47.431 --> 08:49.600
- You promise?
- What is it?

08:52.104 --> 08:55.525
I can't help if you don't tell me
what it is.

08:58.611 --> 09:01.365
We might have caught something.

09:01.573 --> 09:03.785
What do you think it is?

09:03.993 --> 09:06.996
We heard syphilis
was going around school.

09:08.039 --> 09:09.250
I see.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.879
Why don't you girls
come with me, okay?

09:13.088 --> 09:14.799
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:15.549 --> 09:17.133
- It hurts!
- What is it?

09:17.300 --> 09:20.931
- I'm worried she's bleeding internally.
- Oh, no.

09:21.139 --> 09:23.518
- Where's the ambulance?
- It's coming.

09:23.726 --> 09:25.144
Let's just drive her.

09:25.353 --> 09:27.897
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

09:28.106 --> 09:30.651
Sir! You, the plumber.

09:32.027 --> 09:36.324
I need your help.
Can you make room for this girl?

09:36.491 --> 09:41.122
- Put her in the van?
- She needs to get to the hospital.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.500
Okay, let's go.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.963
- In his underwear? My father?
- I can't believe it.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.256
- What did you say?
- What could I say?

09:49.465 --> 09:53.346
I tried to talk to her about it,
but we just argued.

09:53.554 --> 09:56.391
- It's not funny.
- It beats ice fishing.

09:56.599 --> 10:00.687
- Don't you find it bizarre?
- It's not such a bad thing.

10:00.854 --> 10:04.025
Are they going to keep on doing it?

10:04.192 --> 10:08.531
He's coming in this afternoon.
I'll talk to him.

10:08.739 --> 10:10.116
Yeah, thanks.

10:12.077 --> 10:13.329
I can't breathe.

10:13.538 --> 10:16.958
Her rib could've punctured a lung.
Look right.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.752
Now to the left.

10:19.211 --> 10:21.923
- Laura? Laura?
- Oh, my God!

10:23.715 --> 10:25.343
- No breath sounds.
- What is it?

10:26.302 --> 10:27.930
She has a tension pneumothorax.

10:28.138 --> 10:32.310
An air leak is keeping
her heart from beating.

10:32.519 --> 10:36.357
We have to use this needle
to relieve the pressure.

10:37.733 --> 10:39.111
Oh, my God!

10:41.446 --> 10:45.493
- Why is she bleeding?
- I might've nicked an artery.

10:46.202 --> 10:48.664
Push where the blood's coming out.

10:50.123 --> 10:51.209
Something wrong?

10:51.543 --> 10:55.338
- These pads are soaked.
- Just keep pressing them.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.343
Come on, damn it.

10:59.594 --> 11:02.555
I'm coming in with a major trauma.

11:02.889 --> 11:06.894
Clear a room
and get four units of O-neg.

11:08.397 --> 11:11.274
Go faster.
We need to be there now!

11:12.859 --> 11:16.949
Auto versus 10-year-old girl.
Trauma to lower chest...

11:17.157 --> 11:19.828
- ... and fractured left femur.
- Hang on!

11:20.036 --> 11:23.915
- We need a chest tube right away.
- Pulse is thready.

11:24.123 --> 11:26.293
- Need any help?
- No. Got it.

11:27.461 --> 11:31.257
She was stable, then I lost her pulse.

11:31.466 --> 11:34.845
And I may have nicked her intercostal.

11:35.054 --> 11:37.724
- What happened?
- The van hit a bump.

11:37.933 --> 11:42.688
- Why not wait for the ambulance?
- I waited seven minutes.

11:42.896 --> 11:45.984
Paramedics arrived two minutes
after you left.

11:46.151 --> 11:47.778
You'll have to wait.

11:47.986 --> 11:50.155
Trauma panel. Type and cross for 4.

11:50.364 --> 11:53.493
Two large-bore IVs, prep the chest.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.412
BP's 80, palp pulse 110.

11:55.621 --> 11:59.917
- Where's my mom?
- She's outside. How are you doing?

12:00.877 --> 12:03.840
- I'll give you something for the pain.
- Lidocaine.

12:04.298 --> 12:06.259
- I need ultrasound.
- Let's move.

12:06.468 --> 12:10.180
- Luka, we got it from here.
- I'll stay.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.934
- Get X-ray up here.
- Pulse ox 92.

12:13.434 --> 12:15.354
Let's intubate. 6½ ET tube.

12:15.562 --> 12:17.147
I'm in, hook me up.

12:17.356 --> 12:20.567
- Chest full of blood.
- You did hit the artery.

12:20.860 --> 12:25.533
Call the O.R., hold a room.
Looks like more than a nick.

12:25.699 --> 12:28.452
- We got a liter out.
- Pressure's 50.

12:30.580 --> 12:35.671
- She's unresponsive.
- Prep for a right-sided thoracotomy.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.924
- Not much longer.
- Is Terri okay?

12:39.132 --> 12:41.636
She's fine.
She's sitting in Chairs.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.181
There's cervical bleeding.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.558
It might be dysplasia.

12:46.767 --> 12:51.147
- Is that syphilis? Dysplasia?
- There's no sign of syphilis.

12:51.356 --> 12:53.401
We'll wait for the blood test.

12:54.068 --> 12:56.737
- You can get dressed.
- So I can go?

12:56.946 --> 12:59.700
No. Your HIV test won't take long.

12:59.991 --> 13:03.454
- Am I all right?
- Let's see what the test says.

13:04.497 --> 13:10.212
The other girl looks okay,
but do a stat pap smear on this one.

13:10.547 --> 13:12.048
Let's get you dressed.

13:13.884 --> 13:17.263
- Well, Mr. Perth.
- Ron, please.

13:17.429 --> 13:20.392
- Your blood count's normal.
- Good, right?

13:20.976 --> 13:25.439
Right, but it takes a while
for a crit to show a blood loss.

13:25.648 --> 13:27.566
But I feel okay.

13:28.360 --> 13:32.824
I'd hate to have you bleed out
at 35,000 feet.

13:33.032 --> 13:35.118
- You want another test.
- Yeah.

13:35.284 --> 13:38.122
I'm going to draw some blood...

13:38.330 --> 13:42.920
...which is tagged with a
radionuclide which I reinject by IV.

13:43.129 --> 13:45.297
Then I trace for bleeding.

13:45.798 --> 13:50.303
- As long as I won't glow in the dark.
- It's quick, I promise.

13:51.848 --> 13:56.269
- Is it really the thought that counts?
- About what?

13:56.644 --> 14:00.191
My girlfriend's birthday.
I was considering jewelry.

14:00.441 --> 14:05.154
- But if I go there, I've got to go big.
- I don't know.

14:05.321 --> 14:10.495
- My husband gave me a surprise picnic.
- Romantic.

14:11.204 --> 14:12.540
Cheap.

14:12.748 --> 14:13.790
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:13.957 --> 14:16.335
- Dr. Weaver, Mr. Perth.
- How's he doing?

14:16.502 --> 14:22.176
- I'm doing a nuclear medicine scan.
- We don't do those very often.

14:22.926 --> 14:26.765
- CBC and lytes come back?
- Yeah, they're normal.

14:26.974 --> 14:29.561
- Can we talk a minute?
- Sure.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.314
Hold that.

14:36.860 --> 14:41.826
The belly's benign, there's no
evidence of a bleed. Why do the test?

14:42.033 --> 14:47.165
- His skin is pale, his eyes are dull-
- Not diagnostic of a bleed.

14:47.374 --> 14:51.712
I don't think the scan is necessary.
You should discharge him.

15:00.306 --> 15:02.392
- Is there a problem?
- No.

15:03.268 --> 15:06.146
I just have to get this to the lab.

15:08.066 --> 15:09.317
- More suction.
- Got it.

15:09.526 --> 15:12.070
- Can you stick-tie the bleeder?
- No.

15:12.237 --> 15:15.032
- Keith needle.
- What are you doing?

15:15.241 --> 15:19.038
Kennedy maneuver.
Transmural hemostatic suture.

15:19.247 --> 15:22.166
- Hang another unit.
- And autotransfuse.

15:22.375 --> 15:26.338
I tie the superior and inferior
and tie them tight.

15:26.547 --> 15:29.925
- Dry as a bone. Nice.
- New seizure in 2.

15:30.135 --> 15:32.178
I'll get this. You okay?

15:32.387 --> 15:35.934
- Check the BP.
- How about another crit?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.438
- Fine.
- Let's go talk to the mother.

15:39.604 --> 15:41.774
- Pressure's crashing.
- Chest is dry.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.609
Check the belly again.

15:44.318 --> 15:49.283
- She must still be bleeding.
- You're right. Belly's full of blood.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.120
- She blew the capsule.
- Should've checked.

15:52.287 --> 15:55.541
Let's hang two units
and move to the O.R. now!

15:56.960 --> 15:59.671
- What is it?
- We're going to surgery.

15:59.879 --> 16:02.633
- This is her mom.
- Come with us.

16:04.051 --> 16:06.096
We'll take it from here.

16:06.304 --> 16:10.893
- I want to stay. She's my patient.
- No. Not anymore.

16:11.435 --> 16:13.271
Go and get some sleep.

16:13.479 --> 16:15.482
You think I'm going to sleep?

16:19.278 --> 16:22.323
- That's hilarious.
- Oh, my God!

16:22.533 --> 16:24.451
We got to go. Bye.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.454
We were just talking to some friends.

16:26.663 --> 16:28.957
I need to talk to Andrea privately.

16:29.207 --> 16:32.461
- Is she all right?
- Could you wait outside?

16:32.670 --> 16:34.297
Hey, it's okay.

16:38.510 --> 16:39.678
Thanks.

16:41.013 --> 16:43.851
Andrea, we got your test results.

16:44.059 --> 16:47.521
They found abnormal cells
in your pap smear.

16:48.188 --> 16:50.525
You might have cervical cancer.

16:50.692 --> 16:53.529
We need to do a biopsy
to make sure.

16:53.737 --> 16:57.032
Cancer? Was it caused by having sex?

16:57.241 --> 17:02.456
You get it from an infected partner.
It's human papilloma virus.

17:02.748 --> 17:07.628
- Not everyone with HPV has cancer-
- You can't tell my parents.

17:09.173 --> 17:13.220
If you have this,
you need to be hospitalized.

17:13.887 --> 17:17.391
You said everything I told you
was confidential.

17:17.684 --> 17:20.478
If you're not treated,
you'll get sick.

17:20.688 --> 17:23.567
We also have to inform your partner.

17:29.239 --> 17:31.617
I don't know who it is.

17:31.993 --> 17:34.162
I mean, which one.

17:34.371 --> 17:35.831
How many have you had?

17:37.082 --> 17:38.209
Not sure.

17:40.753 --> 17:42.589
We have these parties.

17:48.888 --> 17:50.516
- I want to scrub in.
- No.

17:50.725 --> 17:51.892
- Why?
- You're not a surgeon.

17:52.101 --> 17:56.273
- I'm not asking to operate.
- I'll call you when I'm done. Let's go.

17:56.481 --> 17:57.983
She'll be all right.

17:59.694 --> 18:04.073
- Are you coming back down to the ER?
- In a minute.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.618
I'll show you where you can wait.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.708
Mrs. Saltzman was in for
shoulder pain.

18:10.916 --> 18:15.379
She had an MRI.
You were right. Herniated disc.

18:15.587 --> 18:18.300
And Mr. Blandeleau, chest pain.

18:18.466 --> 18:23.055
Ruled in for an Ml, had angioplasty.
And he's doing okay.

18:23.264 --> 18:25.058
That's it.

18:25.267 --> 18:27.645
- Thanks.
- No problem.

18:28.646 --> 18:32.817
- Are you doing Lucy's cases too?
- Told Weaver I didn't mind.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.158
How was the memorial service?

18:38.992 --> 18:42.162
Okay. It was nice.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.664
A little weird.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.838
How's everything else downstairs?

18:49.213 --> 18:52.133
Same old thing. How are you doing?

18:53.217 --> 18:55.137
I'm doing fine.

18:56.221 --> 19:00.310
- People drop by here all day.
- I bet.

19:00.519 --> 19:04.022
- Even my grandmother.
- I thought you two didn't talk.

19:04.481 --> 19:09.321
There's nothing like a
stab wound to put a spin on things.

19:09.572 --> 19:12.658
Hey, I'm gonna be back to work soon.

19:12.867 --> 19:17.206
- Maybe I'll take up skydiving.
- You do that.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.586
- Get out of here. I need my rest.
- Okay.

19:22.086 --> 19:24.756
- Need help getting on the bed?
- No.

19:25.048 --> 19:27.135
- Catch you tomorrow.
- Yep.

19:28.721 --> 19:33.350
- John- Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

19:35.186 --> 19:38.816
- Listen, take it easy, okay?
- Yeah. Thanks, Deb.

19:47.118 --> 19:48.161
Dad.

19:49.579 --> 19:53.250
- You're late.
- Three minutes.

19:53.500 --> 19:58.090
I was worried you might have
fallen through the ice.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.508
Yeah. Very funny, Mark.

20:00.718 --> 20:03.137
- Like you don't know.
- Just having fun.

20:03.345 --> 20:05.640
Which is apparently
what you were doing.

20:05.849 --> 20:10.146
- Elizabeth wasn't amused.
- I'd say that's accurate.

20:10.354 --> 20:12.106
It was wrong to be at her place.

20:12.315 --> 20:14.818
- Don't worry.
- We'll get a room tonight.

20:15.027 --> 20:17.654
- What?
- It'll be easier for everyone.

20:17.863 --> 20:19.657
So it's an ongoing thing?

20:19.866 --> 20:24.289
- You think this is a one-night stand?
- I don't know.

20:24.622 --> 20:27.292
- What floor's this pulmonologist on?
- Fifth.

20:28.543 --> 20:33.133
I like her. She makes me happy.
Sorry if that makes you unhappy.

20:33.341 --> 20:36.387
- I didn't say that.
- But she'll be gone soon...

20:36.595 --> 20:41.601
...and I'll be back on your sofa.
Then we can both be unhappy.

20:43.937 --> 20:46.273
- How many has she slept with?
- I don't know.

20:46.481 --> 20:49.110
Both have been going to sex parties.

20:49.318 --> 20:51.155
My God! At their age?

20:51.321 --> 20:53.783
I can't tell her parents.

20:53.992 --> 20:57.078
But she's a minor who needs surgery.

20:57.287 --> 20:59.790
Maybe she'll let me tell them.

20:59.999 --> 21:04.839
I know what you're doing,
but this is a public health issue.

21:05.047 --> 21:08.009
At least one of those boys
is spreading HPV.

21:08.175 --> 21:12.222
And the girls at those parties
need to be examined.

21:12.431 --> 21:15.934
So you also need to call the school.

21:27.782 --> 21:31.997
- Did you see two girls here?
- They went out that door.

21:32.205 --> 21:33.457
Damn it!

21:38.880 --> 21:40.174
Excuse me?

21:41.175 --> 21:42.217
Yeah?

21:42.384 --> 21:45.137
I'm Barbara Knight.
I'm looking for Dr. Greene.

21:45.346 --> 21:49.893
- He was here just a minute ago.
- Or maybe Dr. Weaver?

21:50.102 --> 21:53.439
She was here too.
Right now, I'm all you got.

21:54.482 --> 22:00.073
- I need to find your lounge area.
- People don't usually wait in there.

22:01.408 --> 22:05.997
No, I just need to
check my daughter's locker.

22:08.082 --> 22:13.005
- I'm sorry. Your name?
- Barbara Knight. I'm Lucy's mother.

22:19.805 --> 22:25.604
- I don't have the combination.
- The med school gave it to me.

22:33.113 --> 22:34.614
Thank you.

22:57.351 --> 23:01.440
I've checked into the Ritz-Carlton.
I don't need that.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.233
This is unnecessary.

23:03.442 --> 23:06.571
They have a lovely view.
Now I have a meeting.

23:06.779 --> 23:07.823
Stop it.

23:08.032 --> 23:13.371
At our ages, there's no reason for
us to be living together.

23:13.538 --> 23:16.709
You say that as if
we ever really lived together.

23:17.209 --> 23:22.132
I love you. But I swear, at
times you can be insufferable.

23:22.340 --> 23:27.181
- Me? I can be insufferable?
- What exactly do you blame me for?

23:27.389 --> 23:29.557
I don't blame you for anything.

23:29.765 --> 23:32.394
Then stop acting as if you do.

23:32.561 --> 23:35.773
So I wasn't the conventional mother.

23:35.983 --> 23:39.153
- What about your father?
- It's not about Dad.

23:39.361 --> 23:42.240
No. It's about
what I couldn't provide.

23:42.907 --> 23:45.578
Fathers aren't blamed
for working too much.

23:45.745 --> 23:48.789
Mothers are blamed
if they work at all.

23:49.749 --> 23:54.005
Should you have a child sometime,
will you give up your work?

23:54.213 --> 23:57.759
I don't know. I don't know if
that's gonna happen.

23:57.967 --> 24:01.930
Then I'm sorry I set you
such a terrible example.

24:04.934 --> 24:06.478
- Technetium?
- Yeah.

24:06.687 --> 24:08.814
- Any signs of bleeding?
- No.

24:09.023 --> 24:12.611
Why'd you order a scan
that I said was unnecessary?

24:12.819 --> 24:18.159
Maybe it's a nursing instinct.
But the guy does not look well.

24:18.367 --> 24:20.454
It's winter. Nobody looks well.

24:20.621 --> 24:23.541
And medical students
don't order tests.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.878
It wastes your time and his money.
Cut him loose.

24:30.090 --> 24:35.431
Abby, if Benton calls, get me.
I'm gonna grab something to eat, okay?

24:35.639 --> 24:38.851
- I thought you weren't on.
- I'm not.

24:51.868 --> 24:54.663
- Have you called the police?
- What?

24:55.080 --> 24:56.331
I'm not done yet.

24:56.539 --> 24:59.376
- Call them now!
- Get out of my way!

24:59.668 --> 25:01.713
- You're not leaving!
- Leave me alone!

25:01.921 --> 25:03.257
What's wrong with you?!

25:03.466 --> 25:05.216
- Get off!
- You left her!

25:05.425 --> 25:08.596
- I don't know anything.
- You hit her and left.

25:08.804 --> 25:13.352
- I don't know anything.
- I saw you, and I can identify you!

25:13.561 --> 25:16.522
- It was an accident.
- And you just drove off?

25:16.689 --> 25:20.027
- I was scared, okay?
- So was that little girl!

25:20.194 --> 25:24.782
I panicked. I've had a couple DUIs.
But I wasn't drinking today.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.578
I didn't know what to do.

25:27.786 --> 25:30.373
But you knew enough to run away, huh?

25:30.790 --> 25:35.796
- Is she here? Is she all right?
- You don't have the right to ask.

25:53.735 --> 25:57.281
Maybe I was just being
a hypochondriac.

25:57.489 --> 26:02.163
No, you were right to come in.
And you'd be right to come back.

26:02.370 --> 26:05.666
Well, thanks. I'll keep an eye on it.

26:05.916 --> 26:09.129
Say, in 15 minutes,
if you're feverish...

26:09.338 --> 26:12.716
...or sick to your stomach,
get that checked out.

26:12.924 --> 26:14.344
But you just saw me.

26:15.011 --> 26:18.098
It may not be me again,
but somebody would...

26:18.307 --> 26:23.480
- ... and they'd examine you thoroughly.
- Are you saying I'm not okay?

26:23.688 --> 26:28.737
I'm just saying that it's been
an awfully bad flu season.

26:47.051 --> 26:49.679
- You wanna take a break?
- No, I'm okay.

26:49.888 --> 26:52.015
- That's enough for today.
- Hang on.

26:52.223 --> 26:55.102
- You did great. I'll get-
- I can do it!

26:55.311 --> 26:57.564
I just wanna get back to my room.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.406
Dr. Carter?

27:15.878 --> 27:19.089
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

27:19.298 --> 27:22.427
- You promised, you bitch!
- You need to come in.

27:22.636 --> 27:25.891
- You said there were rules.
- I know, but I can't.

27:26.099 --> 27:27.818
- You lied.
- To both of us.

27:27.926 --> 27:30.839
It is a lot more complicated than that.
Your health is in danger.

27:30.874 --> 27:33.024
And other girls could get infected too.

27:33.191 --> 27:35.861
Now everyone's gonna know everything.

27:36.445 --> 27:39.114
Andrea? Andrea!

27:42.494 --> 27:48.471
So we'll have to reschedule the bowel
resection for 4:30.

27:51.463 --> 27:55.093
Hello. Sorry.
I didn't mean to surprise you.

27:55.302 --> 27:58.221
Certainly not twice in one day.

27:58.430 --> 28:00.682
You're here for your appointment?

28:00.892 --> 28:05.064
I've already been. Got poked and
prodded and x-rayed.

28:05.272 --> 28:07.900
- Damn doctors. No offense.
- None taken.

28:08.108 --> 28:12.406
And I'm sorry if my presence
offended you this morning.

28:12.698 --> 28:16.244
I was just-
Well, you said it. Surprised.

28:16.410 --> 28:18.997
I didn't mean to make trouble
for you two.

28:19.206 --> 28:22.084
Oh, no. None that wasn't
there already.

28:22.293 --> 28:27.132
- And why is there trouble?
- Mothers and daughters, I suppose.

28:27.341 --> 28:30.553
You don't own
the whole ranch on that one.

28:30.762 --> 28:34.308
Let's save a little corner
for fathers and sons.

28:34.516 --> 28:38.395
But I will admit
mothers and daughters are worse.

28:38.605 --> 28:41.066
But that's just a woman thing.

28:41.734 --> 28:46.363
The only problem with children
is they grow up to be adults.

28:46.572 --> 28:48.825
Yes, eventually we have opinions.

28:49.034 --> 28:52.288
I know.
But do you have to express them?

28:52.455 --> 28:55.124
It's a learned response.

28:55.416 --> 28:57.127
I'll give you that.

28:58.378 --> 29:00.840
I suggest the four of us go out...

29:01.049 --> 29:04.302
...sort of bury the hatchet.

29:04.803 --> 29:07.139
Mark thinks it's a great idea.

29:07.348 --> 29:09.225
He doesn't.

29:09.851 --> 29:10.895
He will.

29:13.686 --> 29:18.027
- Abby didn't discharge him?
- He's back with abdominal pain.

29:18.193 --> 29:21.116
- BP's 80/60.
- Hang a unit on the infuser.

29:21.325 --> 29:24.998
- What happened?
- I began a rectal. He started gushing.

29:25.206 --> 29:28.379
It's a bleeding tic.
Get four units, call O.R.

29:28.546 --> 29:33.053
- I already did. I'm in.
- Okay, hook him up.

29:33.219 --> 29:35.724
Thank God he came back in.

29:39.231 --> 29:43.571
Chicago wasn't her first choice.
She wanted San Francisco.

29:43.779 --> 29:46.160
I took her when she was 8.

29:46.368 --> 29:49.958
One ride on a cable car
and it was her city.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.087
Although she grew to love this one.

29:55.885 --> 29:59.601
- You don't need to hear all this.
- No, it's fine.

29:59.809 --> 30:03.356
I really just wanted to stop by
and thank you.

30:03.565 --> 30:06.070
Lucy always talked about you...

30:06.278 --> 30:09.326
...how she was first assigned to you.

30:10.243 --> 30:15.294
She had a lot of respect for you.
And you must've taught her a lot.

30:17.256 --> 30:21.262
- She worked with all the residents.
- I know.

30:21.471 --> 30:24.142
But you're the one
she used to mention.

30:27.941 --> 30:31.321
But she-
She loved her work.

30:34.662 --> 30:38.710
She was better
than I ever gave her credit for.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.142
Can I ask you something?

30:49.187 --> 30:50.688
Yes.

30:52.817 --> 30:54.654
When you were-

30:54.862 --> 30:59.286
Well, when that man stabbed you,
what did you think?

30:59.495 --> 31:01.123
No...

31:01.332 --> 31:04.838
...I mean, what did it feel like?

31:15.231 --> 31:20.073
It happened really fast, and I didn't
know what was going on.

31:20.281 --> 31:22.410
But I didn't feel a thing.

31:24.581 --> 31:26.584
No pain?

31:28.712 --> 31:30.258
No pain.

31:47.996 --> 31:51.503
Did you get that venogram
I ordered two hours ago?

31:51.711 --> 31:53.715
I had a CT -guided biopsy.

31:53.924 --> 31:57.346
- You gonna get it?
- After my embolization.

31:57.555 --> 32:00.978
- Does that mean tomorrow?
- With that attitude.

32:01.144 --> 32:04.819
- Did you read a CT on David Greene?
- Who?

32:05.027 --> 32:09.450
- My father. He came in for a scan.
- Check the pile.

32:09.659 --> 32:11.162
That's a big stack.

32:11.371 --> 32:14.252
While you're at it,
read a few plain films.

32:14.460 --> 32:19.385
- Or you could work a few more hours.
- Don't start.

32:19.635 --> 32:23.392
- ER guys want wet reads yesterday.
- Here we go.

32:23.600 --> 32:27.356
ICU orders portables for every
feeding-tube placement.

32:27.565 --> 32:32.867
You think you have high volume in ER?
I get high volume from the hospital.

32:40.130 --> 32:42.174
Hey, Mark? You okay?

32:46.890 --> 32:48.226
That's your dad?

32:49.896 --> 32:51.358
Yeah.

32:54.069 --> 32:55.197
Wow.

32:56.282 --> 32:58.077
I'm sorry.

33:02.919 --> 33:06.425
- He didn't say where we're going?
- Just an address.

33:06.592 --> 33:10.933
It's the "wear jeans" part that's
scaring me. Mother has no jeans.

33:11.142 --> 33:14.104
- I don't know if I want to see her.
- Right.

33:14.313 --> 33:17.235
- I wish we could face them together.
- Yeah.

33:17.444 --> 33:19.281
- Are you all right?
- What?

33:19.448 --> 33:24.122
- You're down to one-word responses.
- I'm sorry.

33:24.290 --> 33:26.794
I've gotta finish up.
I'll meet you there.

33:27.003 --> 33:28.339
All right.

33:28.547 --> 33:30.050
I'll see you.

33:31.302 --> 33:35.267
- What'd the school say?
- They'll help. But the girls saw me.

33:35.476 --> 33:37.687
They didn't listen this time?

33:37.898 --> 33:39.816
No, they ran away.

33:39.984 --> 33:41.821
You did the right thing.

33:42.029 --> 33:44.450
I'm still gonna call Andrea later.

33:45.201 --> 33:50.419
Your hemorrhoid patient's in the O.R.
They're doing a laparotomy.

33:50.628 --> 33:54.008
- I heard. Is he gonna be okay?
- He should.

33:54.175 --> 33:56.346
He's got a bleeding diverticulum.

33:56.512 --> 34:00.353
It's pretty lucky that he
checked himself back in.

34:02.606 --> 34:05.653
- I'm gonna go check on him later.
- Good.

34:05.862 --> 34:09.243
You were right.
There was more wrong with him.

34:09.452 --> 34:11.413
Just a gut feeling.

34:11.830 --> 34:15.712
He could've bled to death
if he hadn't come back.

34:15.880 --> 34:19.428
Well, it's a good thing
that he felt fluish.

34:19.637 --> 34:23.351
That's exactly what he said: "fluish. "

34:30.781 --> 34:35.163
Mrs. Williams, Laura came out
of surgery very well.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.590
The nurse will take you
to see her, if you'd like.

34:43.928 --> 34:45.514
Thank you.

34:45.723 --> 34:47.434
Both of you.

34:50.899 --> 34:54.989
- I was out of line before. I'm sorry.
- I understand.

34:55.197 --> 34:58.329
- You fixed her hepatic vein?
- Atrial-caval shunt.

34:58.536 --> 35:02.168
She should be fine.
You saved her life.

35:02.378 --> 35:07.219
I'm not so sure. You had to
open her chest to fix my mistake.

35:07.427 --> 35:11.519
We had to do it anyway.
The liver was life-threatening.

35:11.727 --> 35:14.315
If you waited,
she might not have made it.

35:14.524 --> 35:16.235
It's impossible to know.

35:16.443 --> 35:17.655
Listen to me.

35:17.821 --> 35:21.369
You made a call.
It took a lot of guts.

35:29.383 --> 35:31.887
- What have you got?
- Andrea Parks.

35:32.096 --> 35:35.686
O.D. No suicide note,
but lots of bottles in the cabinet.

35:37.229 --> 35:40.987
- Any narcotics?
- No. She's lethargic, but arousable.

35:41.195 --> 35:44.993
- When did she take the pills?
- An hour or two ago.

35:45.202 --> 35:47.747
- What kind of drugs?
- Leave me alone!

35:47.956 --> 35:49.835
- Poly-drug.
- What'd you take?

35:50.043 --> 35:53.550
- You know her?
- From this morning. Cervical cancer.

35:53.758 --> 35:58.725
- CBT, blood and urine tox screen.
- On my count. One, two, three.

35:58.934 --> 36:02.482
- We'll pump her stomach.
- She may not need lavage.

36:02.691 --> 36:05.404
- Did you get the pills?
- I had them-

36:05.571 --> 36:07.907
- We need them.
- Maybe you should leave.

36:08.075 --> 36:10.246
- Did you send-
- You're running this?

36:10.454 --> 36:14.920
Pulse ox is 96 on two liters.
It could be Tricyclics.

36:17.507 --> 36:21.056
- So tonight's the jazz club.
- It's a good spot.

36:21.265 --> 36:24.062
Good group is playing.
Cleo knows it too.

36:25.438 --> 36:29.153
- What's that mean?
- Nothing. You're right on schedule.

36:29.361 --> 36:30.948
All right, give it to me.

36:31.115 --> 36:34.704
First, there was probably
coffee in the cafeteria.

36:34.912 --> 36:38.753
Then dinner in a nice
but well-lit restaurant.

36:38.962 --> 36:42.302
Then, maybe a sporting event.
And tonight's jazz.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.972
We all know what happens
after the jazz.

36:45.140 --> 36:47.477
When did your brain lose its filter?

36:47.686 --> 36:51.234
I think you took it out in the O.R.
last week.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.155
- Here. Let me help you.
- I got it!

36:54.321 --> 36:57.536
- Damn it!
- Carter. Carter. Carter.

36:57.745 --> 36:59.999
It's all right. It's all right.

37:01.293 --> 37:02.921
You okay?

37:03.504 --> 37:05.175
I lied to Lucy's mother.

37:05.341 --> 37:10.016
I said it wasn't painful
to have a knife shoved into your gut.

37:17.988 --> 37:19.700
She's tachy at 120.

37:19.908 --> 37:23.205
- You know what she took?
- She was on the floor.

37:23.372 --> 37:26.170
- Was it from your cabinet?
- My parents'.

37:26.378 --> 37:30.135
- What was there?
- I don't know. Tylenol, aspirin-

37:30.343 --> 37:33.892
- Anything prescription?
- My dad takes pain pills.

37:34.059 --> 37:37.063
- Do you know what they're called?
- Diaza...

37:37.272 --> 37:40.028
- Diazepam?
- Sats down to 81.

37:40.236 --> 37:42.615
- Barely responsive.
- Lost gag reflex.

37:42.823 --> 37:44.534
- Let's intubate.
- I'll bag her.

37:44.743 --> 37:47.540
- She could vomit.
- Antidepressants?

37:47.749 --> 37:49.586
- No.
- Are you sure?

37:49.794 --> 37:51.171
- History of seizures?
- No.

37:51.380 --> 37:54.677
- Push flumazenil.
- She's hypoxic. Intubate.

37:54.886 --> 37:57.182
Give the flumazenil a chance.

37:57.433 --> 37:59.436
We have to protect her airway.

38:02.273 --> 38:04.194
All right, good. It worked.

38:04.402 --> 38:06.406
What am I doing here?

38:06.615 --> 38:08.744
Terri found you.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.624
Do you remember taking pills?

38:11.874 --> 38:14.044
- What?
- You'll be okay, Andrea.

38:14.294 --> 38:16.925
Oh, God, Andrea! What did you do?

38:18.219 --> 38:20.514
Let's give her charcoal now.

38:30.615 --> 38:32.201
It's an interesting game.

38:32.452 --> 38:36.376
- Don't worry, you'll get it.
- A martini would help.

38:36.626 --> 38:39.171
That should do the trick.
Loosen you up.

38:39.338 --> 38:41.509
- You want anything?
- No, thanks.

38:41.675 --> 38:44.973
- What's keeping Mark?
- He'll be here. I hope.

38:45.182 --> 38:48.063
- Do you know how to keep score?
- Not a clue.

38:48.230 --> 38:53.238
- But you're learning American games?
- One by one. At least I'm trying.

38:53.488 --> 38:56.410
I think that's
rather adventurous of you.

38:58.830 --> 39:02.379
That meeting
I was running off to earlier...

39:02.504 --> 39:04.174
...I missed it.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.555
- First time that's happened.
- I think it was.

39:07.805 --> 39:10.518
Just couldn't be bothered to go.

39:10.726 --> 39:14.858
- Went and sat by the lake instead.
- I bet that was freezing.

39:15.109 --> 39:17.405
The only thing colder...

39:17.530 --> 39:20.868
...was the conversation we had
this afternoon.

39:23.165 --> 39:27.756
Elizabeth, I know I'm not
the mother you wish you'd had.

39:30.302 --> 39:35.561
- That's not exactly true.
- I keep hoping that you'll forgive me.

39:35.770 --> 39:38.733
The problem is
you never wanted forgiveness.

39:40.194 --> 39:42.198
There's the rub.

39:44.284 --> 39:47.749
Mark's dad says children
shouldn't have opinions.

39:47.958 --> 39:49.210
Yes?

39:49.502 --> 39:51.798
Well, he's absolutely right.

39:57.850 --> 40:01.439
- I'll take over, Connie.
- Sure, thanks.

40:02.651 --> 40:05.197
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

40:08.619 --> 40:12.835
I had to tell the school so
other students could get tested.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.798
But I haven't told your parents.
Or Terri's.

40:16.007 --> 40:19.639
- You haven't?
- I was hoping you would.

40:24.771 --> 40:28.612
If it happened to one of them,
wouldn't you want to know?

40:42.344 --> 40:44.347
- That was ugly.
- Am I penalized?

40:44.514 --> 40:48.940
- It's just a little dent.
- What? There's not a little dent.

40:49.149 --> 40:51.737
I'm kidding. Hey, hey, Mark.

40:51.945 --> 40:54.783
- What kept you?
- Oh, nothing.

40:54.992 --> 40:56.661
- Hi.
- Sit down. Have a drink.

40:56.870 --> 40:59.332
- My ball's stuck.
- You broke it.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.547
- Press the button.
- We'll work you in next.

41:02.756 --> 41:03.798
No problem.

41:04.007 --> 41:06.846
Boys against girls wouldn't be fair.

41:07.054 --> 41:10.143
Neither one of them
is any good at all.

41:10.352 --> 41:12.397
And I'll be back on the sofa.

41:12.564 --> 41:17.113
Isabelle's going back
to Elizabeth's tonight.

41:17.322 --> 41:19.326
- Sure.
- Grab a ball.

41:19.951 --> 41:24.793
- No, you're too far to the right.
- But last time it went left.

41:25.002 --> 41:27.757
- You see those marks?
- The arrows?

41:27.966 --> 41:33.308
Aim for the one on the right.
And pull the ball all the way back.

41:33.516 --> 41:37.775
And don't drop it.
Just let it roll on the floor.

41:37.983 --> 41:40.905
- Wrist straight.
- That's an awful lot.

41:41.071 --> 41:42.115
I'll show you.

41:42.282 --> 41:46.706
- I never knew he was a surgery intern.
- He was good, smart.

41:46.915 --> 41:51.047
He'd spend all of his time
talking to patients.

41:51.256 --> 41:53.218
One time Morgenstern made him...

41:53.427 --> 41:58.853
...hold a retractor for four hours.
Carter never broke a sweat.

41:59.063 --> 42:01.566
He'll be all right, Peter.

42:02.568 --> 42:04.222
Tickets.

42:05.339 --> 42:07.323
You sure you wanna go in there?

42:07.529 --> 42:09.842
We're not gonna be able to talk.

42:10.049 --> 42:13.564
Let's go get some coffee. Come on.

42:15.919 --> 42:19.103
- You're gonna disappoint Carter.
- What?

42:19.432 --> 42:20.713
- Nothing.
- What?

42:20.920 --> 42:21.954
Nothing.

42:22.161 --> 42:24.271
What? Nothing.

42:35.875 --> 42:37.420
That was fun tonight.

42:37.629 --> 42:40.342
Yeah, it was.

42:42.554 --> 42:44.808
Dad, I need to talk to you.

42:45.684 --> 42:46.895
Sure.

42:49.691 --> 42:52.154
I saw your scan today.

42:52.571 --> 42:56.245
You have lung cancer
which has spread to your liver.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.710
Yeah.

43:05.093 --> 43:08.808
That's what the doctors
in San Diego said too.

43:11.229 --> 43:13.608
How long have you known?

43:14.443 --> 43:15.779
For a while.

43:20.537 --> 43:22.665
Why didn't you tell me?

43:25.796 --> 43:28.885
You remember old Rear Admiral Norris?

43:29.594 --> 43:32.976
How could I forget him?
He was missing a thumb.

43:33.142 --> 43:35.647
He scared me to death as a kid.

43:36.272 --> 43:38.402
He had cancer.

43:39.611 --> 43:42.867
Every time I laid eyes on him,
I thought:

43:43.076 --> 43:46.958
"Poor old bastard, he's got cancer. "

43:47.709 --> 43:50.589
Hell, he lived another 12 years.

43:51.549 --> 43:54.513
But still, every time I saw him...

43:57.935 --> 44:01.233
I didn't want it to define me, Mark.

44:01.943 --> 44:07.159
I didn't wanna see it in people's
eyes. I didn't want to see it at all.

44:09.715 --> 44:11.517
And...

44:14.464 --> 44:16.483
...I'm scared.
