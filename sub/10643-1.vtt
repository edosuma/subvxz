{\an1}it's epic.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.497
{\an1}Like I like to my left, there's

{\an1}we're wing manning each other.

01:37.889 --> 01:38.723
{\an1}I get drunker and drunker and

{\an1}drunker and drunker.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.267
{\an1}And then I look to my right, and

{\an1}I see the most beautiful girl I

{\an1}have ever seen.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.233
{\an1}She's like glowing, red hair,

01:48.316 --> 01:50.109
{\an1}she's got like one small neck

01:50.193 --> 01:52.153
{\an1}tattoo that suggests I'm pretty

{\an1}fun, but I'm not crazy.

01:54.739 --> 01:55.740

01:55.824 --> 01:57.158
{\an1}that girl."

01:57.242 --> 01:58.743
{\an1}And the problem though is like

02:05.124 --> 02:06.167
{\an1}So like me hitting on this girl

02:06.251 --> 02:07.627

02:12.215 --> 02:13.800
{\an1}Things are going well though,

02:13.883 --> 02:14.551
{\an1}because eventually she's like,

02:14.634 --> 02:16.177
{\an1}"So do you wanna go upstairs?"

02:16.261 --> 02:17.428
{\an1}I'm like, "Yeah."

02:17.512 --> 02:18.054
{\an1}And that's the best.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.556

06:07.533 --> 06:08.034

06:11.496 --> 06:13.623

06:13.706 --> 06:14.624
{\an1}started popping.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.583
{\an1}And I like the song, so I'm

06:15.666 --> 06:16.667
{\an1}grooving, like, "Girl, okay,

06:19.462 --> 06:22.298

06:24.425 --> 06:25.551

06:25.635 --> 06:26.511
{\an1}not to look.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.553
{\an1}She was about to wind up and

06:27.637 --> 06:29.180
{\an1}hurt the world.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.516
{\an1}She gave me a one last thrust,

06:31.599 --> 06:33.851
{\an1}and then she flipped.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.728
{\an1}"Oh, my God, Tracy Grandma, are

06:35.812 --> 06:36.687
{\an1}you okay?"

06:36.771 --> 06:37.522
{\an1}And she just like,

06:37.605 --> 06:39.107

06:39.190 --> 06:39.941
{\an1}"Can you go in there and get my

06:41.275 --> 06:41.984

06:42.068 --> 06:42.693

06:42.777 --> 06:43.861
{\an1}So, as I'm rubbing the

06:43.945 --> 06:45.905
{\an1}medication on her, she started

06:45.988 --> 06:47.573
{\an1}breathing mighty hard.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.534
{\an1}"Oooh, boy, you just so strong.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.078

06:52.161 --> 06:53.788

06:53.871 --> 06:55.748

06:55.832 --> 06:57.166

06:57.250 --> 06:58.459
{\an1}move to the other side.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.211

07:00.294 --> 07:01.087
{\an1}"What was you in here doing with

07:07.635 --> 07:09.178
{\an1}upstairs.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.556
{\an1}So, she stands up, walks to the

07:11.639 --> 07:12.640
{\an1}doorway.

07:12.723 --> 07:13.474
{\an1}And I'm thinking that she 'bout

07:33.369 --> 07:36.080
{\an1}She goes one little whoosh.

{\an1}be at my grand mom's.

12:01.095 --> 12:01.846
{\an1}I was hella hungry, so I'm just

12:01.929 --> 12:02.972
{\an1}like, "Aunt Doreen, can I get in

12:03.055 --> 12:04.265

12:04.348 --> 12:05.474
{\an1}My Aunty Doreen was just like

12:05.558 --> 12:06.976
{\an1}goosing away on this one.

12:07.059 --> 12:07.852
{\an1}She's like, "Oh, that's my

12:07.935 --> 12:09.687
{\an1}hummus hibiscus dip."

12:09.770 --> 12:10.604
{\an1}And I'm like, "All right, Aunt

12:10.688 --> 12:11.313
{\an1}"Doreen, is there any sesame in

12:11.397 --> 12:11.981

12:12.064 --> 12:12.982
{\an1}"It's okay, don't worry.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.567
{\an1}Everything's fine."

12:14.650 --> 12:15.609
{\an1}So I took like seven tortilla

12:15.693 --> 12:16.402
{\an1}chips.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.820
{\an1}I was just like, "Let's go.

12:17.903 --> 12:18.654
{\an1}Mm, this is definitely exotic."

12:18.737 --> 12:21.240
{\an1}I sit down with my pops.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.116
{\an1}My throat's feeling a little

12:22.199 --> 12:23.451
{\an1}like weird and carpet-y.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.326
{\an1}And I start to get like this

12:24.410 --> 12:25.453

12:25.536 --> 12:26.454
{\an1}"Chris, there's something wrong.

{\an1}We got some trouble down here."

12:27.705 --> 12:28.873
{\an1}And I look in the mirror, and

12:28.956 --> 12:30.040
{\an1}I'm like, "Oh my God, what have

12:30.124 --> 12:30.875

12:30.958 --> 12:31.709
{\an1}I've so red.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.334
{\an1}And I'm like, "Aunt Doreen, what

12:32.418 --> 12:33.294
{\an1}was in the dip?"

12:33.377 --> 12:34.753
{\an1}"Oh, just like a little of this,

12:34.837 --> 12:35.921
{\an1}"a little of that, little tahini

12:37.381 --> 12:39.049
{\an1}Are you dead ass, Aunt Doreen?

12:39.133 --> 12:40.092
{\an1}Tahini sauce?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.218
{\an1}Tahini sauce?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.136
{\an1}"Well, what's the problem?"

12:42.219 --> 12:43.053
{\an1}I'm like, "That's pure

12:43.137 --> 12:44.472

12:44.555 --> 12:45.389

12:45.473 --> 12:46.015

12:46.098 --> 12:46.891
{\an1}She's like, "I completely

12:46.974 --> 12:48.184
{\an1}forgot, Chris."

12:48.267 --> 12:48.934
{\an1}At this point, I look like the

12:49.018 --> 12:49.894
{\an1}Michelin Man.

12:49.977 --> 12:50.978
{\an1}My eyes look so clipped, like I

12:51.061 --> 12:52.021
{\an1}just smoked like seven bong

12:52.104 --> 12:52.229
{\an1}hits.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.023
{\an1}My throat like's closing up.

12:54.106 --> 12:54.940
{\an1}I went to my mom.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.108
{\an1}And she's like, "Oh my God!"

12:56.192 --> 12:56.984
{\an1}My dad's just like, "Dude, what

12:58.027 --> 12:58.736
{\an1}"Steve, we have to get to the

12:59.695 --> 13:00.738
{\an1}My grandpa's like, "Oh my God,

13:00.821 --> 13:01.363
{\an1}we gotta get him there," still

13:01.447 --> 13:02.865
{\an1}laying on the couch.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.033
{\an1}My dad's driving 100 miles per

13:04.116 --> 13:04.200
{\an1}hour.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.993
{\an1}My mom goes into her pocketbook.

13:06.076 --> 13:06.994
{\an1}She always keeps an EpiPen in

13:07.077 --> 13:08.037
{\an1}there, you know, just in case of

13:08.120 --> 13:09.121
{\an1}emergencies.

13:09.205 --> 13:09.788
{\an1}She's like, "Oh my God, I've

13:09.872 --> 13:10.998
{\an1}"never done this before.

13:11.081 --> 13:11.957
{\an1}I'm so scared."

13:12.041 --> 13:13.042
{\an1}Halfway breathing, I'm like,

13:13.125 --> 13:13.834
{\an1}"Mom, just do it."

13:13.918 --> 13:14.376
{\an1}She's like, "All right, take

13:14.460 --> 13:15.461
{\an1}your pants off."

13:15.544 --> 13:16.378
{\an1}Little did we know, they can go

13:16.462 --> 13:17.671
{\an1}directly through the jeans.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.172
{\an1}So me getting naked was

13:18.255 --> 13:20.090
{\an1}completely nonsensical.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.091
{\an1}"Did you stab him yet?"

13:21.175 --> 13:22.885
{\an1}"I think I'm just gonna reread

13:22.968 --> 13:23.552
{\an1}the directions."

13:23.636 --> 13:24.595
{\an1}"Just stab him."

13:24.678 --> 13:25.346
{\an1}[gasping]

13:26.055 --> 13:26.597

13:26.680 --> 13:27.223
{\an1}"He's dying!

13:27.306 --> 13:27.848
{\an1}You can't hurt him more than

13:27.932 --> 13:28.557
{\an1}that."

13:28.641 --> 13:29.225
{\an1}"[gasping] Mom,

13:29.308 --> 13:30.267
{\an1}just--just do it."

13:30.351 --> 13:30.893
{\an1}"Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes."

13:30.976 --> 13:32.895
{\an1}And I close my eyes, too.

13:32.978 --> 13:33.896
{\an1}She takes the cap off, she goes

13:33.979 --> 13:35.272
{\an1}to press the button.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.857
{\an1}I hear this shriek.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.192
{\an1}"Oh my God!"

13:38.275 --> 13:39.109
{\an1}I open my eyes, my mom's just

13:39.193 --> 13:40.528

{\an1}"My [bleep] thumb."

13:43.030 --> 13:44.031
{\an1}She had it backwards.

13:44.114 --> 13:44.615
{\an1}She didn't even make it to my

13:44.698 --> 13:45.449
{\an1}leg.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.825
{\an1}She just stabbed her finger.

13:46.909 --> 13:47.826
{\an1}So then we pull up to the

13:47.910 --> 13:48.994
{\an1}emergency room.

13:49.078 --> 13:49.578
{\an1}I was like near death at this

13:49.662 --> 13:50.454

13:50.538 --> 13:51.622
{\an1}I roll out of the car like a

13:53.249 --> 13:54.041

13:54.124 --> 13:54.542
{\an1}And at the front of the

{\an1}entrance, this one little short

13:56.043 --> 13:57.503

14:09.640 --> 14:10.516
{\an1}They rush me to the bed.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.557
{\an1}the site rep came to talk to me,

15:33.641 --> 15:35.392
{\an1}and asked me about my love life.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.018
{\an1}And she asked if I had a

15:36.101 --> 15:37.227
{\an1}boyfriend.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.145
{\an1}So I told her I'd just been

15:39.146 --> 15:40.773
{\an1}"Oh, what happened?"

15:52.493 --> 15:53.243
{\an1}you know, she was probably going

15:53.327 --> 15:54.578
{\an1}to like get some food from the
