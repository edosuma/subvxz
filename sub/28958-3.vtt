WEBVTT

00:00.926 --> 00:02.316
My name is Talon.

00:02.319 --> 00:04.933
I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.

00:04.936 --> 00:07.535
I escaped when Everit
Dred killed all my people.

00:07.538 --> 00:10.539
I cut off the points of my
ears to hide in plain sight.

00:10.542 --> 00:12.673
A tiny creature lives inside me,

00:12.676 --> 00:14.545
passed to me by my dying mother.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.462
It gives me the power to
open portals to another world

00:17.465 --> 00:19.900
and summon powerful
demons called Lu-Qiri.

00:19.903 --> 00:22.480
But I can only summon them
when I have their names,

00:22.483 --> 00:24.570
something that's proving
to be a challenge.

00:24.573 --> 00:27.357
The Prime Order wants me
dead, but I've found sanctuary

00:27.360 --> 00:30.982
at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.

00:30.985 --> 00:33.157
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:33.163 --> 00:35.816
- You summoned another demon?
- And a Blackblood.

00:35.819 --> 00:36.850
We don't have enough men.

00:36.853 --> 00:38.879
We'll have to make do
until our allies arrive.

00:38.882 --> 00:40.561
What about your promise to Gwynn?

00:40.563 --> 00:42.222
I can't control a demon army.

00:42.225 --> 00:45.261
I'll give you three days to
consider my offer to marry me.

00:45.264 --> 00:47.134
- I want you to guide him.
- Janzo?

00:47.137 --> 00:49.137
Make him into the man that
Talon needs in her life.

00:49.161 --> 00:52.508
This is for Talon and your Queen,

00:57.101 --> 00:58.980
I decided I'm giving Rebb the Asterkinj.

00:58.983 --> 01:01.796
Did you really think the
prophecy could be about you?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.772 --> 01:23.511
You dare to come before us

01:23.514 --> 01:27.475
after such a massive
failure, Ambassador Dred?

01:27.478 --> 01:29.652
I am honored to bow before The Three,

01:29.655 --> 01:32.004
and I pledge my heart and blood.

01:32.007 --> 01:34.662
But with respect to The Holy Three,

01:34.665 --> 01:37.102
I do not consider my journey a failure.

01:45.023 --> 01:46.240
I brought you...

01:48.722 --> 01:50.113
...another prize.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.843
What prize could be more valuable

01:55.846 --> 01:57.512
than the head of the false queen

01:57.514 --> 01:59.601
or the corpse of the Blackblood?

01:59.603 --> 02:03.605
Both of which you've failed to procure.

02:03.607 --> 02:08.306
I bring you the means to yet
achieve those goals, my Three.

02:12.790 --> 02:15.660
Commander Garret Spears,

02:15.662 --> 02:18.794
the false queen's betrothed
and organizer of her guard.

02:18.796 --> 02:22.145
He will provide us with the
information that we can use

02:22.147 --> 02:24.236
to bring down the rebellion.

02:25.237 --> 02:26.628
He's no good to us dead.

02:26.630 --> 02:29.807
Take him to the Institute.

02:32.070 --> 02:36.072
Now, as for you, Dred.

02:36.074 --> 02:39.032
You have indeed brought
us a valuable tool

02:39.034 --> 02:41.077
to use against the false queen.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.774
But he would not be necessary

02:42.776 --> 02:47.257
had you simply done what
you were sent to do.

02:47.259 --> 02:50.113
You failed to kill the false queen.

02:50.116 --> 02:53.332
You accomplished
nothing of your mission.

02:53.335 --> 02:56.962
The punishment for
such failure is death.

02:56.965 --> 03:01.706
However, we will not give you death yet.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.927
But you may wish we had.

03:07.018 --> 03:12.630
You will live out your
life in a cell so small,

03:12.632 --> 03:15.244
you won't be able to lie down.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

03:30.999 --> 03:33.521
Tell me, Naya, do you think I've kept

03:33.523 --> 03:35.358
Baron Aegisford waiting sufficiently

03:35.361 --> 03:38.091
in order to demonstrate who has
the power in this relationship?

03:38.093 --> 03:41.139
- I do, Your Majesty.
- Then send him in.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.102
Her Majesty will see you now.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.844
It's about time.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.936
Ravishing as always.

03:56.763 --> 03:59.025
That was a long wait
for your future husband.

03:59.027 --> 04:01.027
Yes, well, I'm a busy woman, Baron.

04:01.029 --> 04:05.250
And as of now, you are most
certainly not my future husband.

04:06.773 --> 04:08.860
Do you play?

04:08.862 --> 04:10.253
I dabble.

04:10.255 --> 04:11.909
Shall we play a few hands?

04:13.257 --> 04:15.127
Hmm.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.130
And, um,

04:18.132 --> 04:20.481
what would be the wager?

04:20.483 --> 04:23.454
Well, I played strip Octor one time.

04:23.457 --> 04:25.071
That's where we remove a piece of...

04:25.074 --> 04:27.357
- You may leave now.
- That was a joke.

04:27.359 --> 04:29.359
Does Your Majesty not
have a sense of humor?

04:29.361 --> 04:33.015
Enough to know that that was less
of a joke than the man who told it.

04:33.017 --> 04:36.323
Ouch. Do you play Octor as
well as you spar verbally?

04:36.325 --> 04:39.761
How about this? If I win,
then you give me your armies

04:39.763 --> 04:41.292
without the condition of marriage.

04:41.295 --> 04:42.642
- And if I win?
- You won't.

04:42.645 --> 04:45.421
If you're so sure, if I win, marry me.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.684
Agreed. Five hands.

04:49.686 --> 04:51.526
If you win three out of
five, I will marry you,

04:51.528 --> 04:54.450
and you will give me your armies, your
gold, and everything else you own.

04:54.453 --> 04:58.823
But if I win, I will not have to
suffer the indignity of marrying you,

04:58.825 --> 05:01.783
but you will still give me
your armies, your gold,

05:01.785 --> 05:03.192
and everything else you own.

05:06.442 --> 05:10.400
Maybe we should play simply as a
pretense to get to know one another.

05:10.402 --> 05:13.438
Hmm. I do believe you're
afraid I might beat you.

05:13.441 --> 05:15.057
On the contrary.

05:15.059 --> 05:18.060
A gentleman never wagers
at cards with a lady.

05:18.062 --> 05:20.193
Hmm. Fine.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.544
Sit.

05:28.072 --> 05:29.637
The man usually deals.

05:29.639 --> 05:30.683
Not in my kingdom.

05:34.165 --> 05:35.469
I couldn't help but notice

05:35.471 --> 05:37.008
that the Outpost's mining operations

05:37.011 --> 05:39.203
and the weapons forging
haven't been restarted.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.886
Both were manned by
slave and prison labor,

05:40.910 --> 05:42.432
and I refuse to use either.

05:42.434 --> 05:45.131
Then how do you hope to outfit our army?

05:45.133 --> 05:47.051
My army.

05:47.054 --> 05:50.665
I will pay the workers a fair wage to
mine the ore and forge the weapons.

05:50.668 --> 05:54.096
Mm, I wasn't aware your
treasury was so full.

05:54.098 --> 05:56.142
Rumor has it you're broke.

05:56.144 --> 05:58.100
Hmm.

05:58.102 --> 06:00.624
- Octor two.
- I have nothing.

06:00.626 --> 06:01.285
Then I win.

06:01.310 --> 06:03.263
Don't you wish we were
playing for clothing?

06:03.266 --> 06:05.890
- Deal the cards.
- Me?

06:05.892 --> 06:08.575
- But I'm a man.
- Oh, is that what you are?

06:08.578 --> 06:11.896
- You haven't answered my question.
- Which is what?

06:11.898 --> 06:15.337
How are you going to pay to restart
your mines and your smelters?

06:17.034 --> 06:18.383
I don't know.

06:21.908 --> 06:22.909
Are you laughing at me?

06:24.781 --> 06:27.738
The Prime Order army could be
a day away from wiping you out.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.568
I'm laughing at how much you need me.

06:30.874 --> 06:32.961
This game of Octor is over.

06:32.963 --> 06:34.356
You may take your leave.

06:38.534 --> 06:40.188
Your Majesty.

06:48.065 --> 06:50.196
This is insane, Talon.

06:50.198 --> 06:52.502
Who agrees to meet in the forest

06:52.504 --> 06:54.156
in the middle of the night, huh?

06:54.158 --> 06:56.289
I didn't set the time.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.814
Besides, she's a Blackblood.
She's not going to hurt me.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.946
Her demon sure did a number on you.

07:01.948 --> 07:04.427
Which proves my point.
He didn't kill me.

07:04.429 --> 07:06.342
Yeah, but still, there could be...

07:06.344 --> 07:08.170
there could be Greyskins or...

07:08.172 --> 07:09.476
or there could be Plaguelings

07:09.478 --> 07:12.740
- or even there could be...
- Demons?

07:12.743 --> 07:16.278
I asked you to come alone.

07:16.281 --> 07:18.659
- He's no threat.
- She's right.

07:18.661 --> 07:20.741
I'm no threat at all. Just
pretend I'm not even here.

07:22.752 --> 07:24.404
Stay there.

07:26.059 --> 07:27.793
Where's the Dragman?

07:27.796 --> 07:29.759
Healthy as an ox.

07:31.543 --> 07:32.992
So glad you came.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.110
You have decided to
give me the Asterkinj?

07:35.112 --> 07:37.243
First tell me what you're
going to do with it.

07:37.245 --> 07:38.811
Save our people, like I said.

07:41.292 --> 07:45.729
If I agree, you have to
promise to help the Queen.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.341
With a Lu-Qiri army, she
can defeat the Prime Order,

07:48.343 --> 07:51.301
and she'll reward Blackbloods and
Lu-Qiri with lands of their own.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.521
How are you so sure this
human queen will keep her word?

07:54.523 --> 07:56.392
'Cause I know her well.

07:56.394 --> 07:59.265
Then so be it. I trust you.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.312
Pass the Asterkinj,
and we can get started.

08:25.728 --> 08:29.077
Tell it to stop, or I won't
hesitate to kill you.

08:29.079 --> 08:31.384
Stay there.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.563
Go with Janzo.

08:41.874 --> 08:43.832
Why the sudden change of heart?

08:46.444 --> 08:47.971
Because you lied.

09:11.730 --> 09:14.122
- Am I...
- Lucky to be alive?

09:14.124 --> 09:15.212
Yes.

09:17.345 --> 09:19.475
Where am I?

09:19.477 --> 09:22.391
- Who are you?
- A healer.

09:22.393 --> 09:23.958
How long have I been out?

09:23.960 --> 09:27.048
Almost two weeks.

09:27.050 --> 09:30.045
I'm Sana, First Healer to
the Court of The Three.

09:30.048 --> 09:33.232
- You are in my care now.
- So I'm a prisoner?

09:33.235 --> 09:35.839
I don't consider you as a prisoner.

09:35.841 --> 09:39.321
As long as you're
here, you're a patient.

09:39.323 --> 09:41.410
But if I step outside?

09:41.412 --> 09:44.631
Then you will no longer be in my care.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.763
Why are you letting me live?

09:46.765 --> 09:48.852
Why even keep me alive?

09:48.854 --> 09:51.028
- I want to help you.
- Why?

09:51.030 --> 09:53.030
You don't know me.

09:53.032 --> 09:55.903
- How's the pain?
- Ah!

09:58.560 --> 10:01.648
It's nothing that I can't handle.

10:01.650 --> 10:04.303
Thank you...

10:04.305 --> 10:07.088
for the healing and all that,

10:07.090 --> 10:08.263
but I have to go.

10:08.265 --> 10:09.960
- Where?
- Home.

10:09.962 --> 10:12.180
I have duties.

10:12.182 --> 10:14.138
And...

10:14.140 --> 10:17.228
You cannot make it on your own.

10:17.230 --> 10:20.710
Not just yet. You lost too much blood.

10:20.712 --> 10:24.105
You need time to regain your strength.

10:24.107 --> 10:26.499
I've lost a lot of blood before,

10:26.501 --> 10:29.676
and I could always walk two weeks later.

10:29.678 --> 10:31.895
You've never lost this much blood.

10:31.897 --> 10:33.854
You only survived because of my skills.

10:33.856 --> 10:36.097
Don't lack for confidence, do we?

10:36.100 --> 10:38.337
Any other healer and you would be dead.

10:38.339 --> 10:39.773
Now lie down.

10:48.131 --> 10:49.783
You're in good hands, Garret.

10:49.785 --> 10:52.570
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

11:03.451 --> 11:05.146
Take your medicine.

11:05.148 --> 11:08.018
- What is it?
- The reason you're alive.

11:08.020 --> 11:09.892
Take it.

11:15.773 --> 11:17.340
Now go to sleep.

11:33.089 --> 11:34.649
How do we know we can trust her?

11:36.432 --> 11:37.832
Well, she warned me Rebb was lying.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.036
If she was working with her,

11:39.039 --> 11:41.225
she would have let me
transfer the Asterkinj.

11:41.227 --> 11:44.185
How do we know that that's not
all part of her nefarious plan now?

11:44.187 --> 11:45.787
I mean, she's the one who chose the name

11:45.811 --> 11:47.362
that summoned Rebb in the first place.

11:47.364 --> 11:50.539
I gave her the name
I was taught to give.

11:50.541 --> 11:51.714
You can hear us?

11:51.716 --> 11:53.324
Huh. Of course she can.

11:53.326 --> 11:54.327
Of course she can.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.416
Who told you to give me that name?

11:57.418 --> 12:00.201
My mother, and her mother before her.

12:00.203 --> 12:01.681
Like your mum and your grandmum

12:01.683 --> 12:04.276
with the, um, Asterkinj... the gift.

12:04.279 --> 12:06.919
Although I'm starting to question
whether it was a gift or a curse.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.158
My purpose was to
find the one Blackblood

12:09.161 --> 12:10.508
and give her the name Ekkundi.

12:10.511 --> 12:11.995
- Hogswash.
- Janzo!

12:11.997 --> 12:14.215
Don't "Janzo" me. She's the one who...

12:14.217 --> 12:15.999
who rode in with Dred, of all people.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.611
I rode with Dred because I knew
he would lead me to the One.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.902
But only so she could
give you a demon name

12:19.904 --> 12:21.918
that would then summon
a Blackblood, which who...

12:21.920 --> 12:23.529
who I might add, she left with.

12:23.531 --> 12:24.617
When the second Blackblood arrived,

12:24.619 --> 12:26.270
I had to decide which was the One.

12:26.272 --> 12:28.383
And you decided it was Talon, did you?

12:28.386 --> 12:30.231
I decided it was not Rebb.

12:30.233 --> 12:33.454
I looked into her mind, and
I saw it was full of lies.

12:45.248 --> 12:46.595
What is this?

12:46.597 --> 12:48.554
- The key.
- To what?

12:48.556 --> 12:52.081
I do not know, but
it's meant for The One.

12:55.606 --> 12:58.077
Wait, so if I put this
Vex Rezicon in the fire,

12:58.080 --> 13:00.240
can you give me the names
you were trained not to give?

13:20.413 --> 13:23.721
Come.

13:26.115 --> 13:28.550
Your Majesty, there is, um,

13:28.552 --> 13:31.640
a strange woman here to see you.

13:31.642 --> 13:33.207
Strange how?

13:33.209 --> 13:35.603
She appears to be a... a Blackblood.

13:37.866 --> 13:39.300
Have the guards disarm her,

13:39.302 --> 13:41.520
then escort her in,
but remain by her side.

13:41.522 --> 13:43.480
They've already taken
her weapons, ma'am.

13:58.451 --> 13:59.496
Come no closer.

14:05.502 --> 14:07.241
Your Majesty.

14:07.243 --> 14:08.851
My name is Rebb of Norebben,

14:08.853 --> 14:11.288
a Blackblood village
that no longer exists.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.595
You're the Blackblood that
took Talon's little girl.

14:13.597 --> 14:16.424
I assure you I did not take
her. She went willingly.

14:16.426 --> 14:19.253
- She knows who she serves.
- What do you want?

14:19.255 --> 14:21.124
I'm here to offer my help.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.604
And how can you help me?

14:22.606 --> 14:24.129
I can pro...

14:31.093 --> 14:32.962
I can provide you a sizeable demon

14:32.964 --> 14:35.008
and Blackblood army
to defeat your enemy.

14:35.010 --> 14:37.793
So could Talon, if you
hadn't stolen her translator.

14:37.795 --> 14:41.536
As I said, the Dragman went willingly,

14:41.538 --> 14:43.975
and she did so because she
knows that Talon is not the One.

14:45.716 --> 14:50.414
- Go on. Explain.
- If Talon knew her own history,

14:50.416 --> 14:53.635
she wouldn't imagine she could
ever be the Blackblood of prophecy.

14:53.637 --> 14:56.595
She can barely control one Lu-Qiri.

14:56.597 --> 15:00.860
I, one the other hand, don't need
the Book of Names or the Dragman.

15:00.862 --> 15:02.835
I already know the name and disposition

15:02.838 --> 15:05.212
of every creature on the other side.

15:05.214 --> 15:06.561
They will follow me into battle

15:06.563 --> 15:08.258
or anywhere else I lead them.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.523
And why should I trust you?

15:12.656 --> 15:15.918
If you are as wise as your forefather,

15:15.920 --> 15:20.575
you already sense that
what I say is true.

15:20.577 --> 15:24.492
And if I were to put my doubts at rest,

15:24.494 --> 15:26.235
what would you wish from me?

15:28.367 --> 15:30.150
Simply to order your friend Talon

15:30.152 --> 15:33.109
to give the creature
that controls the portal

15:33.111 --> 15:35.636
to its rightful owner... me.

16:39.787 --> 16:40.918
Commander Spears.

16:43.138 --> 16:45.836
It's always a pity when I have
to ruin such a pretty face.

16:47.577 --> 16:48.621
Bring him.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.759
This is what gods do to those
who serve a false queen.

17:29.762 --> 17:31.837
That's funny.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.201
You don't look like a god to me.

17:34.204 --> 17:36.206
Yeah.

18:02.130 --> 18:03.999
So all these names are new to you?

18:04.001 --> 18:06.563
You weren't trained to summon
any of these specifically?

18:11.225 --> 18:13.138
Ah, Talon, there you are.

18:13.141 --> 18:15.141
The Queen would like you
to come to her quarters.

18:15.143 --> 18:17.641
- Well, tell her I'm busy.
- Now. It's urgent.

18:25.457 --> 18:26.807
Sorry about that.

18:32.813 --> 18:34.029
I brought Talon, Your Majesty.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.511
Leave us, Naya.

18:41.691 --> 18:43.386
The other Blackblood came to see me.

18:43.388 --> 18:45.867
Did she hurt you?

18:45.869 --> 18:49.392
No. On the contrary,
she offered to help me.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.918
She said that she can summon a
demon army and a Blackblood army.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.876
You can't trust her.

18:54.878 --> 18:59.056
- Can she?
- Only with my help.

19:01.319 --> 19:04.328
Well, then help her. I need that army.

19:04.331 --> 19:06.366
- What's the rush?
- What's the rush?

19:06.368 --> 19:08.934
At any moment, the Prime
Order could bear down on us.

19:08.936 --> 19:10.261
Then until that time,

19:10.264 --> 19:12.589
until you're ready to mobilize
your army and begin the war,

19:12.591 --> 19:15.377
do you really want a few hundred
demons wandering around?

19:19.381 --> 19:22.208
She said that she could
control them and you can't.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.342
- She lies.
- How do you know?

19:25.909 --> 19:27.517
Because the Dragman told me.

19:27.519 --> 19:29.650
And how can you trust
her? She's only a child.

19:29.652 --> 19:30.999
She's more than a child.

19:31.001 --> 19:32.751
She can see into people's minds.

19:35.324 --> 19:36.964
Oh, I have such a headache.

19:49.628 --> 19:51.846
Gwynn, do you trust me?

19:51.848 --> 19:53.284
Undyingly.

19:56.418 --> 19:59.810
Then trust me to look
after your best interests.

19:59.812 --> 20:01.336
You don't need Rebb.

20:03.991 --> 20:06.643
May I confess something to you, Talon,

20:06.645 --> 20:08.517
that I've not told anyone before?

20:11.999 --> 20:14.001
I'm terrified.

20:19.441 --> 20:21.658
Don't be.

20:21.660 --> 20:23.358
I've got your back.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.452
Oops.

20:31.453 --> 20:34.758
Did I get you wet? Sorry.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.022
I had to wake you.
It's, uh... it's no fun

20:37.024 --> 20:39.241
beating a man when he's asleep.

20:39.243 --> 20:41.963
Then you won't even know how much
you're suffering for a false queen.

20:44.466 --> 20:46.466
What was that?

20:46.468 --> 20:48.468
You were saying?

20:48.470 --> 20:51.212
She's not a false queen?

20:52.561 --> 20:55.214
If so, you can blink once.

20:55.216 --> 20:58.393
I mean, uh, with the eye you have left.

21:03.267 --> 21:05.835
Stupidity. It boggles the mind.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.495
This can all stop, you know?

21:15.497 --> 21:17.149
Soon as you come to your senses

21:17.151 --> 21:19.109
and realize the truth.

21:21.416 --> 21:25.896
That woman is not
Rosmund. Rosmund is dead.

21:25.898 --> 21:29.859
The false queen is nothing
but a commoner like you.

21:32.905 --> 21:36.472
You see, uh, they lied to you,

21:36.474 --> 21:38.561
and you fell for it.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.130
They played you for a fool.

21:43.090 --> 21:45.003
Stop!

21:45.005 --> 21:47.135
You took that man from the
Institute against orders.

21:47.137 --> 21:49.009
I demand you to return him immediately.

21:51.813 --> 21:53.682
So you can baby him some more?

21:53.685 --> 21:55.491
Why do you care so much about this one?

21:55.493 --> 21:58.065
I don't care about him any more
than I care about anyone else.

21:58.068 --> 22:00.409
I'm a healer, that's what I do.

22:00.411 --> 22:03.282
Well, not this time. Now
leave me to my work.

22:03.284 --> 22:05.110
Fine.

22:05.112 --> 22:08.113
But the first place I will go
is to the Chamber of The Three

22:08.115 --> 22:10.075
to tell them that you have
disobeyed their wishes.

22:18.429 --> 22:21.128
- Are you okay?
- I've been better.

22:35.925 --> 22:37.881
Who is it?

22:37.883 --> 22:40.319
It's me, Naya. I've got
the flowers you asked for.

22:40.321 --> 22:41.921
And the Mistress says
she needs more ale.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.670
Thank you. I'll be right there.

22:43.672 --> 22:46.542
Stay here, stay quiet, and, um,

22:46.544 --> 22:48.242
stay away from those cages.

23:02.169 --> 23:04.388
I thought he'd never leave.

23:25.192 --> 23:28.584
You failed me, Dragman.

23:28.586 --> 23:30.501
I do not serve you.

23:38.770 --> 23:39.815
Then you serve no one.

23:49.564 --> 23:50.834
I've brought some more flowers.

23:50.837 --> 23:52.845
Hmm, thank you.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.928
I had no idea where I was going to get
more from that we're already half dead.

23:55.952 --> 23:57.396
- Janzo?
- Hmm?

23:57.398 --> 23:59.746
What do you say to Talon?

23:59.748 --> 24:03.880
- What do you mean?
- When you're trying to woo her.

24:03.882 --> 24:07.362
I wouldn't dare try to woo Talon, Naya.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.625
The Queen has tasked me
with helping make Talon

24:09.627 --> 24:11.845
see you in a different light.

24:11.847 --> 24:14.589
But I can't do it without
you making an effort.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.852
Right.

24:19.071 --> 24:20.584
I... I wouldn't know where to begin.

24:20.587 --> 24:22.856
Well, I can teach you.

24:22.858 --> 24:24.640
That's a bit optimistic, isn't it?

24:24.642 --> 24:26.338
Just give it a try.

24:26.340 --> 24:30.213
For example, um, what
could you compliment her on?

24:32.128 --> 24:34.737
I don't know, okay? Um,
her... her combat skills.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.565
She's quite spectacular at fighting.

24:36.567 --> 24:39.264
It's not exactly romantic.

24:39.266 --> 24:42.832
Um, how about her
hair, her attire, her...

24:42.834 --> 24:43.879
Her eyes.

24:45.881 --> 24:47.272
Definitely her eyes.

24:47.274 --> 24:50.275
That's great. Sit.

24:50.277 --> 24:53.887
Pretend I'm Talon. Look
straight into my eyes,

24:53.889 --> 24:55.717
and tell me what you think of them.

24:57.458 --> 24:59.371
They're very nice.

24:59.373 --> 25:02.678
Janzo, you must make an
effort if I am to help you.

25:02.680 --> 25:06.378
How are they nice? What
do they remind you of?

25:06.380 --> 25:09.119
Don't know.

25:09.121 --> 25:11.774
Look me in the eyes and describe them.

25:11.776 --> 25:14.864
Naya, your eyes are very pretty.

25:14.866 --> 25:16.475
They are.

25:16.477 --> 25:19.175
But they don't hold a candle to Talon's.

25:22.178 --> 25:23.179
Pretend.

25:27.836 --> 25:30.924
Talon...

25:30.926 --> 25:33.970
your eyes are like sapphire pools

25:33.972 --> 25:37.193
reflecting the sky of a spring sun.

25:41.153 --> 25:42.762
Naya?

25:42.764 --> 25:46.637
Um, that was beautiful, Janzo.

25:48.726 --> 25:50.511
- Really?
- Mm.

25:52.600 --> 25:57.342
I mean, you have
really pretty eyes, too.

25:57.344 --> 26:02.738
You do. They're, like, this
really rich brown color,

26:02.740 --> 26:06.481
like dung beetle blood
once it's crushed up.

26:06.483 --> 26:11.225
Um, so the next time you see Talon,

26:11.227 --> 26:14.228
tell her exactly what
you just told me...

26:14.230 --> 26:17.187
about her eyes, not mine.

26:21.411 --> 26:23.193
Let go.

26:23.195 --> 26:24.327
Let go.

26:27.547 --> 26:29.286
Is it night?

26:29.289 --> 26:32.551
I didn't mean to wake you.
I was just checking on you.

26:32.553 --> 26:33.554
Sleep.

26:38.210 --> 26:40.820
My sleeping quarters are
right down the corridor.

26:40.822 --> 26:43.213
I couldn't sleep. I was afraid
they'd take you away from me.

26:43.215 --> 26:45.651
- What?
- Go back to sleep.

26:45.653 --> 26:47.653
Why do you care so much?

26:47.655 --> 26:49.785
I don't want you beaten again.

26:49.787 --> 26:51.004
There are only so many times

26:51.006 --> 26:52.571
the body can handle that much damage.

26:52.573 --> 26:55.095
Oh.

26:55.097 --> 26:58.796
But why do you care if I live or die?

27:03.192 --> 27:04.757
It's not important.

27:04.759 --> 27:07.716
It is if you want me to trust you.

27:07.718 --> 27:09.981
You remind me of someone.

27:12.375 --> 27:15.463
That's all. Not a big deal.

27:15.465 --> 27:16.466
Who?

27:22.037 --> 27:25.778
- Tell me.
- His name was Breeon.

27:25.780 --> 27:28.433
He was my husband.

27:28.435 --> 27:31.436
You remind me of him.

27:31.438 --> 27:34.003
Where is he now?

27:34.005 --> 27:37.180
- Dead.
- I'm sorry.

27:37.182 --> 27:39.588
He was a diplomat sent by The Three

27:39.591 --> 27:41.576
to the East Quarter to
inquire about the village

27:41.578 --> 27:44.623
that had been sacked and burned.

27:44.625 --> 27:50.411
He was brutally killed at
the hands of a Blackblood.

27:50.413 --> 27:52.372
The Blackbloods are gone.

27:55.810 --> 27:58.985
You know as well as I do one remains.

27:58.987 --> 28:01.204
No, they were all wiped out.

28:01.206 --> 28:03.139
I was honest with you, Garret.

28:03.142 --> 28:05.513
Don't you think you owe
me the same consideration?

28:05.515 --> 28:07.697
The Blackblood wanted
revenge on the Prime Order

28:07.700 --> 28:09.483
for a massacre they knew nothing of.

28:09.486 --> 28:12.041
Nobody wipes out an entire village

28:12.043 --> 28:14.130
without the knowledge of The Three.

28:14.132 --> 28:17.046
It was done by private mercenaries
working for Ambassador Dred.

28:17.048 --> 28:18.657
The Three did not approve,

28:18.659 --> 28:21.311
and would have stopped
him had they known in time.

28:21.313 --> 28:24.053
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

28:24.055 --> 28:25.837
When Dred brought you
here, they stripped him

28:25.862 --> 28:27.492
of his rank and put him in a cell.

28:27.494 --> 28:29.145
May he rot there forever.

28:29.147 --> 28:30.714
That doesn't prove anything.

28:34.109 --> 28:38.894
It proves that you don't know
what's true and what's false.

28:38.896 --> 28:43.072
But how do you know it was a Blackblood?

28:43.074 --> 28:45.771
Because I witnessed it with my own eyes.

28:45.773 --> 28:48.077
She had long, black, filthy hair

28:48.079 --> 28:49.775
and eyes that looked right through me.

28:49.777 --> 28:51.951
She fought off half a
dozen Covenant soldiers

28:51.953 --> 28:54.344
and walked away with just a scratch.

28:54.346 --> 28:56.085
But that's all it took for me to see

28:56.087 --> 28:59.003
that her blood ran as black as coal.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.230
I can see you're a good man.

29:10.232 --> 29:12.669
Just like him.

29:16.281 --> 29:19.415
I haven't felt like this since
he was taken away from me.

29:23.071 --> 29:26.942
You need to heal. Go back to sleep.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.862
Sleep. Sleep.

29:53.884 --> 29:55.756
Hey, Talon...

29:59.150 --> 30:00.848
What's wrong? What happened?

30:03.154 --> 30:04.632
What does it look like happened?

30:04.634 --> 30:05.635
Rebb?

30:08.725 --> 30:13.728
I can't believe a
Blackblood could be so evil.

30:13.730 --> 30:16.078
And she burned all the
names the Dragman gave me.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.865
All of them?

30:21.172 --> 30:24.524
Janzo, I can't bury another
person who died because of me.

30:26.395 --> 30:28.177
- Especially a child.
- It's all right.

30:28.179 --> 30:30.094
I'll do it.

30:34.403 --> 30:37.360
You know, I just promised Gwynn
I could summon her a demon army.

30:37.362 --> 30:40.632
Hey, we'll figure something out, okay?

30:40.635 --> 30:42.504
Not without the Dragman.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.936
- Okay.
- Not without some names.

30:53.074 --> 30:54.641
Talon?

30:59.820 --> 31:03.650
A name. A demon name.

31:07.392 --> 31:09.218
Brave child.

31:09.220 --> 31:12.180
She must have been hiding
it even when she was dying.

31:13.616 --> 31:15.573
Or Rebb put it there,

31:15.575 --> 31:18.055
and it's one of her evil friends.

31:27.456 --> 31:30.457
I think it's time we got you up.

31:30.459 --> 31:31.806
Okay, easy.

31:31.808 --> 31:34.896
- Ah!
- There. How does that feel?

31:34.898 --> 31:39.422
Like my entire body is one big bruise.

31:39.424 --> 31:41.555
There's still a way for you.

31:41.557 --> 31:43.818
What, renounce my Queen?

31:43.820 --> 31:45.648
That is never going to happen.

31:48.042 --> 31:51.260
- Remarkable.
- Which part?

31:51.262 --> 31:54.394
The fact that I won't betray my Queen?

31:54.396 --> 31:56.788
The fact you won't give up on the lie.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.617
I mean, despite...

31:59.619 --> 32:02.271
- Despite what?
- Nothing.

32:02.273 --> 32:05.840
It's clearly something. Tell me.

32:05.842 --> 32:08.279
They would take my head off
if they find out what I did.

32:13.937 --> 32:16.459
I swear to you, I will tell no one.

32:16.461 --> 32:18.418
After the Tormentor took you away,

32:18.420 --> 32:20.899
I was afraid they would
kill you next time.

32:20.901 --> 32:22.944
So I did something I
should have never done,

32:22.946 --> 32:24.467
against the will of The Three.

32:24.469 --> 32:25.860
And what was that?

32:25.862 --> 32:28.863
I sent a message to your so-called Queen

32:28.865 --> 32:32.258
offering to meet her or her
representative and hand you over.

32:32.260 --> 32:35.522
I'd rather see you
live with a false queen

32:35.524 --> 32:38.525
than die at the hands of a Tormentor.

32:38.527 --> 32:39.963
Come.

32:42.487 --> 32:44.879
What happened?

32:44.881 --> 32:47.882
You don't want to know.

32:47.884 --> 32:49.233
Tell me.

32:51.714 --> 32:56.630
The return message simply said,

32:56.632 --> 32:59.287
"I already have a new Commander".

33:09.384 --> 33:10.907
- I'm sorry.
- No.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.041
No.

33:15.129 --> 33:16.432
No, you're lying.

33:16.434 --> 33:18.347
You would never send such a message.

33:18.349 --> 33:19.784
You wouldn't take the risk.

33:19.786 --> 33:23.004
I'm telling you the truth.

33:23.006 --> 33:25.354
All I want is for you to be safe,

33:25.356 --> 33:27.705
even if it's not with me.

33:27.707 --> 33:30.708
I sent a message because I care for you.

33:30.710 --> 33:35.582
As a patient, not like Rosmund.

33:35.584 --> 33:38.892
Just like Rosmund.

34:01.653 --> 34:03.743
Have you decided what
you're going to do?

34:05.222 --> 34:06.744
How can I decide?

34:06.746 --> 34:09.877
Can't beat Rebb without
summoning my own demon,

34:09.879 --> 34:12.577
and every time I open
that portal, people die.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.449
I buried the girl for you.

34:17.844 --> 34:19.190
Thank you.

34:19.193 --> 34:21.541
I said some words on your behalf.

34:21.543 --> 34:23.284
Thanks.

34:28.371 --> 34:30.158
I guess, if anything, it lets us know

34:30.159 --> 34:31.985
that Rebb is pure evil.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.161
I was kind of hoping I
was wrong about that.

34:34.164 --> 34:36.775
It would be nice not to
be the only Blackblood.

34:56.056 --> 34:57.056
Talon?

34:58.798 --> 34:59.799
Janzo?

35:04.368 --> 35:07.587
Your eyes remind me of sapphire pools

35:07.589 --> 35:10.853
reflecting in the sky of a spring sun.

35:18.513 --> 35:20.643
Janzo, what has gotten into you?

35:20.645 --> 35:22.776
- Why are you acting so weird?
- What do you mean?

35:22.778 --> 35:25.648
I mean, the new hair, the new attitude.

35:25.650 --> 35:27.825
"Your eyes remind me
of things of whatever".

35:27.827 --> 35:31.098
Sapphire pools reflecting
in the sky of a spring sun.

35:31.101 --> 35:33.235
Just trying to improve myself, Talon.

35:33.238 --> 35:34.746
Is that such a bad thing?

35:42.102 --> 35:43.959
They're coming for you.
We have to hide you.

35:43.962 --> 35:45.399
- Who is coming?
- Quickly.

35:47.672 --> 35:50.850
- Just the man I'm looking for.
- You're not allowed here.

35:53.853 --> 35:56.897
I'm so glad to see you up
and around, Commander.

35:56.899 --> 35:57.987
What is it you want?

35:59.989 --> 36:02.207
Just one question, Commander Spears.

36:02.209 --> 36:05.038
Do you still support the false queen?

36:09.869 --> 36:13.479
Rosmund is not the false queen.

36:13.481 --> 36:16.049
She's the rightful heir to the throne.

36:17.746 --> 36:19.704
I had a feeling you would say that.

36:22.098 --> 36:23.708
- Take him.
- No.

36:47.471 --> 36:48.908
You clean that up.

37:13.541 --> 37:15.584
Janzo!

37:15.586 --> 37:18.500
You. You made a fool of me.

37:18.502 --> 37:21.068
You made a fool out of me, Naya.

37:21.070 --> 37:23.468
Actually, I made a fool
of myself, but still.

37:23.471 --> 37:25.965
You instigated it, so it's
all your fault, Naya.

37:25.968 --> 37:28.113
Or maybe it's just half your fault.

37:28.116 --> 37:29.676
I don't know. I can't believe that's...

37:29.700 --> 37:32.785
Janzo, slow down. What happened?

37:32.788 --> 37:34.429
I listened to you,

37:34.431 --> 37:36.475
and I told Talon about...
about the eye thing.

37:36.477 --> 37:38.303
And do you know what she did?

37:38.305 --> 37:39.882
She laughed at me.

37:39.885 --> 37:42.349
I mean, maybe it's a good
thing, because she was upset.

37:42.352 --> 37:44.949
Janzo! I'm proud of you, Janzo.

37:44.952 --> 37:48.645
- I'm proud of you.
- For what? For what, huh?

37:48.648 --> 37:50.257
For making a fool out of myself?

37:50.260 --> 37:52.434
You surprised her.
That's why she laughed.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.796
It was a nervous laugh.

37:53.798 --> 37:55.984
Women do that when they're flattered.

37:55.987 --> 37:57.379
Yeah, I don't think so.

37:57.382 --> 37:59.476
You know what you have
to do next, don't you?

37:59.479 --> 38:00.479
What?

38:01.763 --> 38:04.024
Kiss her.

38:04.026 --> 38:07.071
No. No, I don't think
she'd like that, Naya.

38:07.073 --> 38:09.595
If you don't think she'd
want you to, you're right.

38:09.597 --> 38:11.379
Maybe you shouldn't.

38:11.381 --> 38:14.339
It's just that last time,
that's the feeling I got when...

38:14.341 --> 38:16.384
- when I kissed her.
- Wait.

38:16.386 --> 38:18.386
- She kissed you?
- Mm-hmm.

38:18.388 --> 38:20.823
Once. I... I got stabbed.

38:20.825 --> 38:22.564
And then I was bleeding profusely.

38:22.566 --> 38:25.654
It was very bad. And then...
then I had an oozing wound

38:25.656 --> 38:27.265
and she came over and she kissed me.

38:27.267 --> 38:28.831
She stuck a hot poker rod in it.

38:28.833 --> 38:31.182
But nonetheless, she kissed you.

38:31.185 --> 38:34.290
Now it's your turn. She's waiting
for you to return the favor.

38:34.293 --> 38:37.119
- Really?
- Sure sounds like it to me.

38:37.122 --> 38:40.300
You have to take her in your arms
and kiss her like you mean it.

38:41.803 --> 38:45.413
No! No, I mean, what if she doesn't
want... what if... what if...

38:45.415 --> 38:47.415
what if she wants to kill
me? I mean, literally?

38:47.417 --> 38:49.243
I don't have time for this.

38:49.245 --> 38:52.246
You know Talon better than
I do, but I'm a woman.

38:52.248 --> 38:56.120
And I know if I were Talon, it would
make me see you in a different way.

38:56.122 --> 38:58.907
Yes, in an "I'm going to
kill you", sort of way.

39:06.843 --> 39:08.886
I'm honored to bow before The Three.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.585
I pledge my heart and blood.

39:10.588 --> 39:12.147
Is there a problem?

39:12.150 --> 39:15.576
Our method was working as planned.

39:17.447 --> 39:22.233
But, uh, this last round,

39:22.235 --> 39:24.249
well, this last session

39:24.252 --> 39:26.891
of negative conditioning...

39:29.416 --> 39:30.656
...unfortunately...

39:30.659 --> 39:34.245
I'm afraid he even went
beyond my healing skills.

39:34.247 --> 39:37.683
I beg forgiveness, my Three.

39:37.685 --> 39:40.686
I'm not used to the
need to keep them alive.

39:40.688 --> 39:43.080
This is inexcusable.

39:43.082 --> 39:47.100
My Three, I'm certain
my method was working.

39:47.103 --> 39:50.087
We built him up to break
him down for several rounds,

39:50.089 --> 39:53.460
but Spears is stronger than
anyone we tested the procedure on.

39:53.463 --> 39:55.246
We refrained from sending

39:55.249 --> 39:57.031
an army to destroy the false queen

39:57.034 --> 40:00.952
because you assured us
that your plan would work.

40:00.955 --> 40:02.708
And it still can, my Three.

40:02.710 --> 40:05.499
I'm sure this final positive
conditioning will be enough.

40:05.502 --> 40:06.667
If you will just...

40:24.732 --> 40:28.734
Our eternal devotion to the
divine power of The Three.

40:28.736 --> 40:33.563
Our army will be ready to march
on the Outpost in five days.

40:33.566 --> 40:37.829
You have that long to prove your
plan is better than our general's.

40:37.832 --> 40:39.614
I'm certain it is, my Three.

40:39.617 --> 40:41.216
Let us hope so.

40:41.219 --> 40:44.793
If you fail, you will die
in inexpressible pain.

40:44.795 --> 40:49.985
We won't fail. My wife here,
she's very good at what she does.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.157
I assure you, my Three,

41:00.159 --> 41:01.854
by the end of the week,

41:01.856 --> 41:04.102
Garret Spears will be yours to command.
