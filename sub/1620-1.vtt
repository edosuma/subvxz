01:56.990 --> 01:59.240
Easy, boy.

03:12.230 --> 03:14.270
What do you expect?
They're savages.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.770
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

03:16.900 --> 03:19.230
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.820
l've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

03:21.950 --> 03:24.110
l never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.410
How close did you get?

03:26.530 --> 03:29.950
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.040
Do the dead frighten you?

03:34.170 --> 03:36.290
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

03:36.420 --> 03:39.630
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.170
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?

03:44.430 --> 03:46.220
Get back on your horse.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.440
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.150
They even killed the children.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.110
lt's a good thing we're not children.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.280
You want to run away south,
run away.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.320
Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.

04:05.450 --> 04:07.570
lf l don't catch you first.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.250
Get back on your horse.

04:12.370 --> 04:14.710
l won't say it again.

04:45.820 --> 04:48.320
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

04:49.030 --> 04:50.700
They were here.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.750
See where they went.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.130
What is it?

05:45.420 --> 05:46.550
lt's...

09:49.630 --> 09:52.090
Go on, Father's watching.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.010
And your mother.

10:02.180 --> 10:05.520
Fine work, as always.
Well done.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.310
Thank you.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.270
l love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.190
Quite beautiful.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.190
The stitching...

10:15.320 --> 10:17.530
Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...

10:19.240 --> 10:21.200
- lt's beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:36.380 --> 10:39.130
And which one of you
was a marksman at ten?

10:40.180 --> 10:41.680
Keep practicing, Bran.

10:43.850 --> 10:45.810
Go on.

10:45.930 --> 10:48.600
Don't think too much, Bran.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.190
Relax your bow arm.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.830
- Quick, Bran!
- Faster.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.410
Lord Stark!

11:12.460 --> 11:13.500
My lady.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.750
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.880
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.300
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

11:25.430 --> 11:27.390
Do you have to?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.600
He swore an oath, Cat.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.730
Law is law, my lady.

11:32.730 --> 11:34.810
Tell Bran he's coming too.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.320
Ned.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.740
Ten is too young
to see such things.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.400
He won't be a boy forever.

11:44.410 --> 11:46.070
And winter is coming.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.430
Good lad, go run back and get the rest.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.150
White walkers.

12:15.270 --> 12:17.980
l saw the white walkers.

12:18.110 --> 12:19.980
White walkers.

12:20.110 --> 12:23.150
The white walkers, l saw them.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.580
l know l broke my oath.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.290
And l know l'm a deserter.

12:37.170 --> 12:39.840
l should have gone back to the Wall
and warned them, but...

12:41.010 --> 12:43.010
l saw what l saw.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.670
l saw the white walkers.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.470
People need to know.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.470
lf you can get word to my family...

12:52.600 --> 12:54.890
tell them l'm no coward.

12:55.020 --> 12:56.980
Tell them l'm sorry.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.660
Forgive me, Lord.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.210
ln the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

13:22.340 --> 13:24.300
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

13:24.420 --> 13:27.260
- ..King of the Andals and the First Men...
- Father will know if you do.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.720
..Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

13:30.850 --> 13:33.720
l, Eddard of the House Stark,

13:33.850 --> 13:36.390
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North,

13:36.520 --> 13:38.980
sentence you to die.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.450
You did well.

14:23.650 --> 14:25.110
You understand why l did it?

14:25.230 --> 14:27.110
Jon said he was a deserter.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.780
But do you understand
why l had to kill him?

14:29.910 --> 14:31.530
"Our way is the old way"?

14:33.160 --> 14:36.830
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

14:37.870 --> 14:40.250
ls it true he saw the white walkers?

14:42.290 --> 14:45.250
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

14:46.420 --> 14:47.920
So he was lying?

14:52.430 --> 14:54.760
A madman sees what he sees.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.620
What is it?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.670
Mountain lion?

15:28.050 --> 15:30.380
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.350
lt's a freak.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.020
lt's a direwolf.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.530
Tough old beast.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.910
There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.

16:37.780 --> 16:39.080
Now there are five.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.370
You want to hold it?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.420
Where will they go?

16:48.540 --> 16:50.250
Their mother's dead.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.920
They don't belong down here.

16:52.050 --> 16:55.840
Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.

16:55.970 --> 16:57.970
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

16:58.100 --> 16:59.760
Put away your blade.

16:59.890 --> 17:02.810
- l take orders from your father, not you.
- Please, Father!

17:02.930 --> 17:04.730
l'm sorry, Bran.

17:04.849 --> 17:05.890
Lord Stark?

17:07.690 --> 17:09.190
There are five pups.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.650
One for each of the Stark children.

17:12.780 --> 17:15.280
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.869
They were meant to have them.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.290
You will train them yourselves.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.290
You will feed them yourselves.

17:28.420 --> 17:31.290
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

17:39.930 --> 17:41.640
What about you?

17:42.510 --> 17:44.180
l'm not a Stark.

17:44.310 --> 17:46.390
Get on.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.900
What is it?

18:02.120 --> 18:05.620
The runt of the litter.
That one's yours, Snow.

19:05.810 --> 19:08.980
As your brother,
l feel it's my duty to warn you...

19:10.230 --> 19:12.230
you worry too much.

19:12.350 --> 19:15.690
- lt's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.900
When we were seven and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

19:21.030 --> 19:25.410
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

19:25.530 --> 19:28.160
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

19:28.290 --> 19:31.870
"We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."

19:34.290 --> 19:37.840
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

19:39.210 --> 19:40.340
My husband.

19:40.470 --> 19:44.220
lf he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.890
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

19:49.770 --> 19:51.600
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

19:51.730 --> 19:55.310
someone to do his job while he's off
fucking boars and hunting whores.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.110
Or is it the other way around?

19:58.650 --> 20:00.990
And life will go on.

20:01.110 --> 20:03.700
You should be the Hand of the King.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.410
That's an honor l can do without.

20:06.530 --> 20:08.160
Their days are too long,

20:08.290 --> 20:09.950
their lives are too short.

20:49.490 --> 20:50.700
All these years,

20:50.830 --> 20:53.960
and l still feel like an outsider
when l come here.

20:55.790 --> 20:57.460
You have five northern children.

20:58.710 --> 21:01.000
You're not an outsider.

21:01.130 --> 21:03.630
l wonder if the old gods agree.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.760
lt's your gods with all the rules.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.850
l am so sorry, my love.

21:16.980 --> 21:20.610
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

21:22.730 --> 21:24.280
Jon Arryn is dead.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.900
A fever took him.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.950
l know he was like a father to you.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.120
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

21:38.250 --> 21:40.250
gods be good.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.850
The raven brought more news.

21:53.970 --> 21:56.350
The king rides for Winterfell...

21:57.390 --> 22:00.190
with the queen and all the rest of them.

22:01.110 --> 22:03.440
lf he's coming this far north...

22:05.110 --> 22:07.030
there's only one thing he's after.

22:07.150 --> 22:10.530
You can always say no, Ned.

22:18.870 --> 22:22.590
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

22:22.710 --> 22:26.460
- l'm told he reads all night.
- l'm told he drinks all night.

22:26.590 --> 22:29.760
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

22:29.890 --> 22:31.430
stature?

22:31.550 --> 22:34.430
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.770
Perhaps we'll find out.

22:35.890 --> 22:37.730
ln any case, candles.

22:43.860 --> 22:46.780
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

22:46.900 --> 22:49.650
lt's for the queen, l bet.
l hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.820
l hear the prince is a right royal prick.

22:51.950 --> 22:55.410
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.460
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.870
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

23:38.870 --> 23:41.540
Gods, but they grow fast.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.500
Brandon!

23:45.630 --> 23:48.630
l saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.840
How many times have l told you?
No climbing.

23:51.970 --> 23:54.930
But he's coming right now, down our road.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.350
l want you to promise me,

24:04.480 --> 24:06.150
no more climbing.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.150
l promise.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.370
- Do you know what?
- What?

24:17.490 --> 24:19.700
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

24:21.870 --> 24:23.620
Run and find your father.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.790
Tell him the king is close.

25:10.210 --> 25:13.590
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

25:23.890 --> 25:26.060
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

25:26.190 --> 25:28.100
What are you doing with that on?

25:30.520 --> 25:32.610
Go on.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.650
Move!

26:57.820 --> 26:59.650
Your Grace.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.830
You've got fat.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.470
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.060
Nine years... Why haven't l seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

27:27.180 --> 27:30.730
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

27:34.650 --> 27:37.190
- Where's the lmp?
- Will you shut up?

27:37.320 --> 27:38.820
Who have we here?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.530
You must be Robb.

27:44.490 --> 27:46.620
My, you're a pretty one.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.910
Your name is?

27:50.040 --> 27:51.410
Arya.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.210
Oh, show us your muscles.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.840
You'll be a soldier.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.130
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.390
Would you please shut up?

28:15.940 --> 28:16.940
My queen.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.820
My queen.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.940
Take me to your crypt.
l want to pay my respects.

28:22.070 --> 28:23.900
We've been riding for a month, my love.

28:24.410 --> 28:26.030
Surely the dead can wait.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.030
Ned.

28:37.710 --> 28:38.920
Where's the lmp?

28:42.420 --> 28:44.430
Where is our brother?

28:44.550 --> 28:46.300
Go and find the little beast.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.350
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.810
One minute he was fine and then...

28:55.020 --> 28:57.770
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

28:58.940 --> 29:00.940
l loved that man.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.400
We both did.

29:02.530 --> 29:06.860
He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

29:06.990 --> 29:08.820
All l wanted to do

29:08.950 --> 29:11.580
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.830
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.580
Don't look at me like that.
lt's not his fault l didn't listen.

29:22.130 --> 29:24.170
l need you, Ned,

29:24.300 --> 29:27.970
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

29:29.850 --> 29:31.640
Lord Eddard Stark...

29:32.600 --> 29:35.060
l would name you the Hand of the King.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.650
l'm not worthy of the honor.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.190
l'm not trying to honor you.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.030
l'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

29:45.150 --> 29:48.860
while l eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

29:48.990 --> 29:50.820
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

29:52.370 --> 29:54.330
You helped me win the lron Throne,

29:54.450 --> 29:57.160
now help me keep the damn thing.

29:57.290 --> 29:59.670
We were meant to rule together.

29:59.790 --> 30:03.630
lf your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

30:04.590 --> 30:06.170
Well, it's not too late.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.510
l have a son,
you have a daughter.

30:11.350 --> 30:13.010
We'll join our houses.

30:38.210 --> 30:41.170
lt is true what they say
about the northern girls.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.720
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.470
l did hear something about that.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.760
And the queen and her twin brother.

30:55.890 --> 30:58.930
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.940
And the other brother?

31:01.060 --> 31:04.270
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

31:05.480 --> 31:07.190
and there's the clever one.

31:08.490 --> 31:09.990
Mmm...

31:10.110 --> 31:12.360
l hear they call him the lmp.

31:12.490 --> 31:14.280
l hear he hates that nickname.

31:14.410 --> 31:17.790
Oh? l hear he's more than earned it.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.160
l hear he's a drunken little lecher,

31:20.290 --> 31:22.750
prone to all manner of perversions.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.670
Clever girl.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.260
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

31:29.590 --> 31:31.170
Have you?

31:31.300 --> 31:32.680
- Already?
- Oh!

31:35.600 --> 31:38.310
The gods gave me one blessing.

31:43.190 --> 31:45.690
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

31:45.820 --> 31:49.480
Should l explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

31:49.610 --> 31:51.650
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

31:51.780 --> 31:54.950
but our sister craves your attention.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.660
She has odd cravings, our sister.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.830
A family trait.

31:59.950 --> 32:02.410
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

32:03.420 --> 32:07.380
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- l'm sorry, l've begun the feast a bit early.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.840
And this is the first of many courses.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.180
l thought you might say that.

32:13.300 --> 32:15.930
But since we're short on time...

32:16.050 --> 32:17.350
Come on, girls.

32:23.310 --> 32:25.100
See you at sundown.

32:25.230 --> 32:27.310
Close the door!

32:39.740 --> 32:42.500
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

32:44.370 --> 32:46.580
She should be on a hill somewhere

32:46.710 --> 32:49.040
with the sun and the clouds above her.

32:49.170 --> 32:51.210
She was my sister.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.010
This is where she belongs.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.510
She belonged with me.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.190
ln my dreams,
l kill him every night.

33:06.730 --> 33:11.020
lt's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.150
Not all of them.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.040
Daenerys!

33:32.210 --> 33:33.920
Daenerys.

33:34.050 --> 33:36.050
There's our bride-to-be.

33:37.050 --> 33:39.640
Look, a gift from lllyrio.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.810
Touch it.

33:42.930 --> 33:45.140
Go on, feel the fabric.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.060
Mmm.

33:53.230 --> 33:55.070
lsn't he a gracious host?

33:58.450 --> 34:02.120
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.120
lllyrio's no fool.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.040
He knows l won't forget my friends

34:06.160 --> 34:08.420
when l come into my throne.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.500
You still slouch.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.179
Let them see.

34:23.969 --> 34:26.730
You have a woman's body now.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.620
l need you to be perfect today.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.540
Can you do that for me?

34:54.090 --> 34:56.670
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

34:58.630 --> 34:59.670
No.

35:06.810 --> 35:09.390
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

35:09.520 --> 35:11.480
they will say it began today.

35:35.210 --> 35:36.880
lt's too hot, my lady.

35:58.150 --> 36:00.070
Where is he?

36:00.190 --> 36:03.070
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

36:20.550 --> 36:22.470
May l present my honored guests?

36:22.590 --> 36:26.140
Viserys of House Targaryen,

36:26.260 --> 36:27.760
the third of his name,

36:27.890 --> 36:31.270
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

36:31.390 --> 36:32.680
and his sister,

36:32.810 --> 36:35.690
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.150
Do you see how long his hair is?

36:41.280 --> 36:44.070
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

36:44.200 --> 36:47.780
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

36:47.910 --> 36:51.750
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

36:53.210 --> 36:57.080
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.590
And you will be his queen.

37:01.380 --> 37:03.260
Come forward, my dear.

37:43.380 --> 37:44.510
Where is he going?

37:44.630 --> 37:47.340
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

37:47.470 --> 37:48.590
Did he like her?

37:48.720 --> 37:52.470
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.850
lt won't be long now.

37:57.980 --> 38:01.610
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

38:02.860 --> 38:06.700
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.280
They cry out for their true king.

38:12.830 --> 38:14.700
When will they be married?

38:14.830 --> 38:18.370
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.750
ls it true they lie with their horses?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.800
l wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.050
Do you take me for a fool?

38:26.170 --> 38:27.880
l take you for a king.

38:28.010 --> 38:31.140
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

38:31.260 --> 38:32.970
My apologies if l've given offense.

38:33.100 --> 38:35.680
l know how to play a man like Drogo.

38:35.810 --> 38:38.600
l give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.560
l don't want to be his queen.

38:46.650 --> 38:48.030
l want to go home.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.030
So do l.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.490
l want us both to go home,

38:53.620 --> 38:55.830
but they took it from us.

38:55.950 --> 38:57.750
So tell me, sweet sister,

38:57.870 --> 38:59.540
how do we go home?

39:02.250 --> 39:03.420
l don't know.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.800
We go home with an army.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.180
With Khal Drogo's army.

39:11.390 --> 39:14.390
l would let his whole tribe fuck you,

39:14.510 --> 39:17.600
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

39:17.730 --> 39:19.390
if that's what it took.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.200
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

39:39.330 --> 39:41.540
What if he thinks l'm ugly?

39:41.670 --> 39:45.090
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.090
He's so handsome.

39:50.260 --> 39:52.970
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

39:53.090 --> 39:56.180
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.970
Why would he say no?

39:58.100 --> 40:01.020
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

40:01.140 --> 40:03.190
He'd have to leave home.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.860
He'd have to leave me.

40:07.860 --> 40:09.980
And so would you.

40:10.110 --> 40:12.450
You left your home to come here.

40:12.570 --> 40:14.320
And l'd be queen someday.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.830
Please make Father say yes!

40:17.950 --> 40:19.740
- Sansa...
- Please, please!

40:19.870 --> 40:22.750
lt's the only thing l ever wanted.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.810
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

40:38.930 --> 40:40.970
Come on!

40:41.100 --> 40:43.850
Come here, you little beauty!

40:59.660 --> 41:00.950
ls he dead yet?

41:06.420 --> 41:07.500
Uncle Benjen.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.710
You got bigger.

41:13.090 --> 41:14.670
Rode all day.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.390
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

41:17.510 --> 41:18.850
Why aren't you at the feast?

41:18.970 --> 41:21.720
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

41:21.850 --> 41:23.770
to seat a bastard in their midst.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.980
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

41:27.100 --> 41:29.060
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

41:29.190 --> 41:30.900
So take me with you
when you go back.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.900
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

41:34.030 --> 41:35.820
l know he will.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.620
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

41:40.740 --> 41:43.410
l'm ready to swear your oath.

41:43.540 --> 41:46.660
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

41:46.790 --> 41:48.710
We have no families.

41:48.830 --> 41:52.550
- None of us will ever father sons.
- l don't care about that.

41:52.670 --> 41:55.630
You might, if you knew what it meant.

41:59.010 --> 42:01.470
l'd better get inside,

42:01.600 --> 42:03.890
rescue your father from his guests.

42:06.940 --> 42:08.980
We'll talk later.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.740
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

42:22.700 --> 42:25.040
What are you doing back there?

42:25.160 --> 42:27.370
Preparing for a night with your family.

42:32.590 --> 42:34.500
l've always wanted to see the Wall.

42:34.630 --> 42:36.420
You're Tyrion Lannister,

42:36.550 --> 42:38.090
the queen's brother?

42:38.220 --> 42:39.880
My greatest accomplishment.

42:41.430 --> 42:44.100
And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?

42:47.560 --> 42:49.730
Did l offend you? Sorry.

42:51.860 --> 42:54.320
You are the bastard, though.

42:55.610 --> 42:57.940
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.820
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

43:01.950 --> 43:04.950
making you...the bastard.

43:06.450 --> 43:09.080
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

43:10.250 --> 43:12.040
Never forget what you are.

43:12.170 --> 43:14.500
The rest of the world will not.

43:14.630 --> 43:16.210
Wear it like armor...

43:17.010 --> 43:19.300
and it can never be used to hurt you.

43:20.970 --> 43:23.640
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

43:26.100 --> 43:28.560
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

43:50.250 --> 43:51.870
You at a feast...

43:52.830 --> 43:54.500
it's like a bear in a trap.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.090
The boy l beheaded...

43:59.420 --> 44:02.340
- did you know him?
- Of course l did. Just a lad.

44:03.510 --> 44:05.600
But he was tough, Ned,

44:05.720 --> 44:06.970
a true ranger.

44:08.720 --> 44:10.480
He was talking madness.

44:11.690 --> 44:13.440
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.860
The two he was with are still missing.

44:17.520 --> 44:20.990
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

44:21.990 --> 44:23.070
Maybe.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.910
Direwolves south of the Wall,

44:27.030 --> 44:29.240
talk of the walkers,

44:29.370 --> 44:31.910
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.960
Winter is coming.

44:36.590 --> 44:38.380
Winter is coming.

44:40.050 --> 44:42.880
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

44:43.010 --> 44:44.470
- How are you?
- l'm good.

44:47.930 --> 44:50.680
ls this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

44:50.810 --> 44:53.560
Yes. Lovely country.

44:57.360 --> 45:00.690
l'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

45:01.990 --> 45:06.360
l remember how scared l was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.160
Hello, little dove.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.330
But you are a beauty.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.750
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.

45:15.870 --> 45:18.460
You're tall. Still growing?

45:18.590 --> 45:20.420
l think so, Your Grace.

45:20.550 --> 45:22.670
And have you bled yet?

45:27.800 --> 45:29.260
No, Your Grace.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.390
Your dress, did you make it?

45:34.180 --> 45:37.440
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.400
l hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.610
l hear the same.

45:44.740 --> 45:46.950
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

45:47.070 --> 45:50.410
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

46:07.430 --> 46:10.050
- Your pardon.
- l hear we might be neighbors soon.

46:10.180 --> 46:13.640
- l hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

46:13.770 --> 46:16.980
l'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

46:17.100 --> 46:19.190
lt would be good
to have you on the field.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.690
The competition has become a bit stale.

46:21.820 --> 46:24.070
- l don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

46:24.190 --> 46:25.740
Getting a little old for it?

46:27.700 --> 46:29.740
l don't fight in tournaments

46:29.870 --> 46:32.240
because when l fight a man for real,

46:32.370 --> 46:34.120
l don't want him to know what l can do.

46:36.410 --> 46:37.790
Well said.

46:39.170 --> 46:40.500
Arya!

46:42.840 --> 46:44.550
lt's not funny!

46:44.670 --> 46:47.300
She always does this.

46:47.420 --> 46:49.840
This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

46:49.970 --> 46:52.430
She always does it
and it's not funny!

46:52.550 --> 46:54.390
Time for bed.

47:05.480 --> 47:07.150
l'm a Northman.

47:08.860 --> 47:13.370
l belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

47:14.410 --> 47:17.160
l won't let him take you.

47:18.710 --> 47:21.290
The king takes what he wants.

47:21.420 --> 47:23.710
That's why he's king.

47:24.750 --> 47:28.420
l'll say, "Listen, fat man."

47:29.720 --> 47:32.840
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

47:32.970 --> 47:34.890
"He belongs to me now."

47:38.640 --> 47:40.690
How did he get so fat?

47:40.810 --> 47:45.110
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

47:46.730 --> 47:49.150
lt's Maester Luwin, my lord.

47:50.610 --> 47:52.530
Send him in.

47:54.830 --> 47:57.160
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

47:57.290 --> 47:59.790
A rider in the night...

47:59.910 --> 48:02.080
from your sister.

48:09.800 --> 48:12.430
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

48:18.430 --> 48:20.680
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

48:20.810 --> 48:23.350
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

48:31.820 --> 48:33.700
What news?

48:35.320 --> 48:37.780
She's fled the capital.

48:40.120 --> 48:42.660
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

48:42.790 --> 48:44.670
By the Lannisters.

48:44.790 --> 48:47.460
She says the king is in danger.

48:47.590 --> 48:49.840
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.590
She doesn't know what she's saying.

48:51.720 --> 48:57.010
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

48:57.140 --> 48:59.310
Do you think she would risk her life,

48:59.430 --> 49:01.020
her son's life,

49:01.140 --> 49:04.520
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

49:11.740 --> 49:13.610
lf this news is true...

49:13.740 --> 49:17.280
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

49:17.410 --> 49:19.830
who but you can protect the king?

49:19.950 --> 49:22.200
They murdered the last Hand.

49:22.330 --> 49:24.540
Now you want Ned to take the job?

49:24.670 --> 49:28.540
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

49:28.670 --> 49:31.170
He's the only one he trusts.

49:32.670 --> 49:35.510
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

49:35.630 --> 49:39.220
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

49:39.350 --> 49:41.350
He owes him nothing.

49:43.270 --> 49:46.480
Your father and brother
rode south once

49:46.600 --> 49:49.230
on a king's demand.

49:51.150 --> 49:53.280
A different time.

49:54.650 --> 49:56.740
A different king.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.430
When do l meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

51:01.550 --> 51:04.970
lf Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

51:05.100 --> 51:08.140
- When?
- When their omens favor war.

51:09.270 --> 51:11.810
l piss on Dothraki omens.

51:11.940 --> 51:14.610
l've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

52:14.540 --> 52:19.510
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull affair.

52:41.860 --> 52:44.910
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

52:45.870 --> 52:48.450
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

52:50.120 --> 52:51.540
Thank you, ser.

52:53.250 --> 52:55.920
Are you from my country?

52:56.040 --> 52:58.090
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear lsland.

52:58.210 --> 53:00.920
l served your father for many years.

53:01.050 --> 53:04.010
Gods be good, l hope to
always serve the rightful king.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.910
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

53:30.040 --> 53:32.790
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

53:32.910 --> 53:35.830
The ages have turned them to stone,

53:35.960 --> 53:37.920
but they will always be beautiful.

53:40.170 --> 53:41.840
Thank you, Magister.

54:50.530 --> 54:52.570
She's beautiful.

54:56.830 --> 54:58.080
Ser Jorah, l...

54:58.210 --> 55:00.960
l don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.880
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

55:25.070 --> 55:27.030
Make him happy.

56:26.420 --> 56:28.420
No.

56:31.760 --> 56:33.590
Do you know the common tongue?

56:38.430 --> 56:40.140
No.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.610
ls "no" the only word that you know?

56:48.110 --> 56:49.440
No.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.850
Rough night, lmp?

57:19.970 --> 57:21.930
lf l get through this without squirting

57:22.060 --> 57:24.940
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

57:25.060 --> 57:26.850
l didn't pick you for a hunter.

57:26.980 --> 57:30.070
The greatest in the land -
my spear never misses.

57:31.150 --> 57:33.110
lt's not hunting if you pay for it.

57:42.160 --> 57:44.200
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

57:44.330 --> 57:46.790
No, but l'm still better than you.

57:49.790 --> 57:51.420
l know what l'm putting you through.

57:51.550 --> 57:53.210
Thank you for saying yes.

57:55.340 --> 57:57.630
l only ask you because l need you.

57:58.850 --> 58:01.390
You're a loyal friend. You hear me?

58:02.470 --> 58:04.060
A loyal friend.

58:04.180 --> 58:05.850
The last one l've got.

58:07.600 --> 58:09.770
- l hope l'll serve you well.
- You will.

58:11.070 --> 58:14.280
And l'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

58:15.610 --> 58:17.860
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

58:28.080 --> 58:29.580
Come on, you.

59:45.950 --> 59:48.750
Stop! Stop.

59:53.630 --> 59:55.880
Are you completely mad?

59:56.000 --> 59:58.510
- He saw us.
- lt's all right, it's all right.

59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.670
- lt's all right.
- He saw us!

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.930
l heard you the first time.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.350
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.440
- How old are you, boy?
- Ten.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.150
Ten.

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:26.330
The things l do for love.
