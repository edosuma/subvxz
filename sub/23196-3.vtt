WEBVTT

00:13.095 --> 00:14.846
Okay, final stage.

00:14.847 --> 00:16.473
Now maneuver your lips
through the anxiety field

00:16.474 --> 00:17.892
towards Jenny's face.
Go left, left!

00:17.892 --> 00:19.685
Ki, this is really weird.

00:19.685 --> 00:21.019
Use the breath mint!
It's gonna boost your confidence!

00:21.020 --> 00:22.104
No, no, don't hit that.

00:22.104 --> 00:23.271
Guys, guys!

00:23.272 --> 00:24.898
I can kiss Jenny
on my own, trust me.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.483
- What, now?
- Raahhhh!

00:26.484 --> 00:27.985
Um, nothing.

00:27.985 --> 00:29.861
<i>We were just beta-testing
kv's new video game.</i>

00:29.862 --> 00:31.530
It's a high school video game.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.699
Video game high school's
video game.

00:33.699 --> 00:35.283
Small part with you in it.

00:35.284 --> 00:36.576
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

00:36.577 --> 00:38.579
Ki, I can't get
past the flag pole.

00:38.579 --> 00:40.080
Oh?

00:40.081 --> 00:41.499
Uh, okay.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.083
Let me show you.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.502
Um...

00:44.502 --> 00:46.086
Hey, so do you want to get
some lunch sometime?

00:46.087 --> 00:49.048
- We should hang out more often.
- Um, okay.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.091
Hey, uh, want to play
the part of the videogame

00:51.092 --> 00:53.511
where I'm making out with Ki?

00:53.511 --> 00:54.595
I'm coming too, guys.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.139
It's just rollplaying!

02:25.603 --> 02:27.605
Boom! Matrix and d dominated

02:27.605 --> 02:30.399
the St. Catherine girls academy
punishers in last night's match.

02:30.399 --> 02:32.025
That makes three wins in a row

02:32.026 --> 02:34.445
for the little j.V. Team
that could.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.614
I tell you what, shotty, if
me and the old ball and chain

02:37.615 --> 02:39.241
had half the chemistry
as these two,

02:39.241 --> 02:40.825
ll wouldn't be sleeping
on the couch.

02:40.826 --> 02:43.203
Or drunk at ten in the morning!

02:43.204 --> 02:44.663
Ha ha! You shouldn't
say that again!

02:46.290 --> 02:47.582
Oh.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.209
It's ok...

02:49.210 --> 02:50.836
Oh, my gosh.

02:50.836 --> 02:52.420
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

02:52.421 --> 02:54.840
Yes, well, it's crunch time,
so mother is wired in,

02:54.840 --> 02:57.717
but father could never resist
a good parents' day.

02:57.718 --> 03:00.178
Uh, yeah, when is
your dad coming in?

03:00.179 --> 03:02.639
Dude, Ki's dad is coming
in, like, 30 minutes.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.643
Pay attention.
We're playing pokermon.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.479
Yes, that's right,
and you two are both invited.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.355
Especially you, Jenny.
You're my cool friend.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.733
<i>Oh. Well, thanks, Ki.</i>

03:12.733 --> 03:14.609
- I'll totally be there.
- Excellent.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.278
Let me just go get cleaned up,

03:16.278 --> 03:18.113
because somebody
got paint all over me.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.449
Yeah, well, uh,
it paints one to know one.

03:21.742 --> 03:24.661
Wow, you just said that,
and we all heard.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.580
Later, guys.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.124
Later! Okay, Ki,

03:29.125 --> 03:32.628
so when I meet your dad,
is it "hello, Mr. Swan,"

03:32.628 --> 03:36.214
or should I say,
"c at less than less than open quotes.

03:36.215 --> 03:37.841
"Oh, Mr. Swan!

03:37.842 --> 03:41.720
Closed quotes!
Return zero semicolon!"

03:41.721 --> 03:44.223
Ted, you learned c++, kind of.

03:44.223 --> 03:46.141
Oh, yes. I know my accent sucks,

03:46.142 --> 03:47.852
but I really want
to impress your dad,

03:47.852 --> 03:49.895
so I'm bringin' out
the big guns:

03:49.895 --> 03:52.856
My k-pop looks, my j-pop charm,

03:52.857 --> 03:54.942
and my big, honkin'
smart guy brain.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.238
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

04:00.489 --> 04:03.033
Catch you later, daddy-o!

04:05.411 --> 04:06.620
Ted...

04:06.620 --> 04:09.706
Did you just give
your dad $5,0007?

04:09.707 --> 04:11.875
I owe him child support.

04:11.876 --> 04:15.087
No big, just smart
and responsible Ted

04:15.087 --> 04:16.797
paying his dad five large.

04:16.797 --> 04:19.132
No, no.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.969
Ted, he pays you child support.

04:21.969 --> 04:23.470
No, Brian.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.848
Don't mean to make you
sound super dumb,

04:25.848 --> 04:28.976
but that would be called
father support.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.114
Oh, my god, guys,
I'm super dumb.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.790
Jenny. I got some good news.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.626
That doesn't sound good.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.794
The pta is giving me this parent
of the year thing in the morning.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.922
I'm not going, am I?

04:57.922 --> 05:00.132
The brunch is at ten,
and then you give a speech at 11:30.

05:00.132 --> 05:01.800
There's a speech?

05:01.801 --> 05:04.512
Just, like, a page,
about how I'm a great mom.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.305
I'm not staying up all night
writing a speech about you.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.472
I have plans.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.057
Jenny, this is important to me.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.392
The countess will be there,

05:10.392 --> 05:12.519
as in the head of
the national FPS league,

05:12.520 --> 05:14.146
so make it good.

05:14.146 --> 05:15.939
Yeah, I know who she is, okay?
I just...

05:15.940 --> 05:17.942
I don't really feel
like talking about you

05:17.942 --> 05:19.234
in front of everybody.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.945
Well, it sucks to be you.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.112
See you at ten.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.283
Can't wait to hear that speech.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.375
Okay. I think I got it.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.710
- Each player starts with five cards.
- Four cards.

05:36.710 --> 05:38.712
D'oh! I'm never gonna
learn this game in time!

05:38.712 --> 05:40.380
I'm such an idiot.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.799
You are not an idiot.

05:41.799 --> 05:45.761
You're just... curious
about the world.

05:45.761 --> 05:47.262
Huh.

05:47.263 --> 05:51.725
Brian, am I just
curious about the world?

05:51.725 --> 05:55.770
What? No, Ted, you're not
an idiot. You're just, uh...

05:58.607 --> 06:01.401
Okay, uh, guys, I gotta go.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.404
Wait. Brian, you're
my backup cool friend.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.198
I'm sorry, Ki.
I'll meet your dad tomorrow.

06:06.198 --> 06:08.200
Oh! What he said! I'm outtie!

06:08.200 --> 06:09.826
Ted, my dad's gonna
be here any second!

06:09.827 --> 06:12.454
Exactly. I can't let him
see that his daughter

06:12.454 --> 06:15.165
is dating a big, dumb idiot.

06:15.165 --> 06:17.125
Out of the way, old man!

06:17.126 --> 06:20.796
Swan's the name.
Ken Swan. I'm Ki's father.

06:20.796 --> 06:22.798
Ohhh!

06:22.798 --> 06:24.925
Of course you are!

06:26.176 --> 06:27.552
Please excuse me.

06:30.681 --> 06:31.932
Come in!

06:52.411 --> 06:53.745
Yes!

06:59.877 --> 07:01.128
Crap!

07:12.806 --> 07:14.057
You're bluffing.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.100
You're stalling.

07:25.861 --> 07:27.988
You had me sweating
for a minute there, kiwi.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.200
Now, about that wager.

07:38.999 --> 07:41.751
Can we play another game?
I have a really great wager.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.044
Isn't it past your bedtime?

07:43.045 --> 07:45.839
Yes. Yes, it is.

07:45.839 --> 07:47.924
Tomorrow, then. Deal?

07:47.925 --> 07:50.135
Deal. When we get home.

07:50.135 --> 07:51.928
Home?

07:51.929 --> 07:53.972
Oh, sorry, I have
class tomorrow.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.725
Honey, your mother
and I had a talk, Ki,

07:56.725 --> 07:59.269
and we don't think this
school is good for you.

07:59.269 --> 08:02.146
Beg your pardon?
On what grounds?

08:02.147 --> 08:03.773
We played the game
you sent home.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.443
High school video game,
was it? Not your best work.

08:06.443 --> 08:08.194
Quite a bit of violence
and kissing,

08:08.195 --> 08:09.696
and more than a few bugs.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.532
<i>Ki, it's not like you.</i>

08:11.532 --> 08:13.116
It's still in beta!

08:14.535 --> 08:16.537
No, I can't leave here.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.914
I'm learning so much.
I'm becoming a better designer.

08:18.914 --> 08:22.500
No, you're not.
Your new game sucks.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.628
You heard that sad child, honey.

08:24.628 --> 08:26.963
It's time to come home.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.258
Wait.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.135
I request a performance review.

08:33.136 --> 08:35.139
This isn't up for discussion.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.975
Article 44, section g of the
Swan family contract states,

08:37.975 --> 08:40.184
"If Ki feels her parents are
being mean and unreasonable,

08:40.184 --> 08:42.937
she can request an official
review of her performance."

08:44.188 --> 08:45.857
Very well.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.317
We start at 0800.

08:47.317 --> 08:49.569
You have 12 hours
to prep your case.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.655
Better get crackin'.

08:51.655 --> 08:53.365
Love you, sir.

08:53.365 --> 08:54.616
Love you, too.

09:14.803 --> 09:16.012
Come on in.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.022
Want a black licourisce soda?

09:25.022 --> 09:27.399
My dad sent a care package.

09:27.399 --> 09:28.733
Okay.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.027
Oh, is he not coming?

09:31.028 --> 09:33.822
Uh, he came last year,
but my mom's here this year,

09:33.822 --> 09:36.741
and they don't really
hang, so...

09:36.742 --> 09:37.784
Hmm.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.454
What about your parents?

09:40.454 --> 09:42.456
Umm...

09:42.456 --> 09:44.416
Well, I lost my dad
when I was 3,

09:44.416 --> 09:47.043
and it's double-xp weekend,

09:47.044 --> 09:49.921
so she's probably not coming.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.722
Wow. That's...

09:58.722 --> 09:59.764
Robust.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.853
So, uh, what did you have to
write a speech about your mom for?

10:04.853 --> 10:07.272
Oh, yeah, she's winning
mother of the year,

10:07.272 --> 10:09.232
and I'm supposed
to introduce her,

10:09.233 --> 10:11.610
but I suck at speeches.

10:11.610 --> 10:14.070
Do you want to see
what I have so far?

10:14.071 --> 10:16.198
Sure, yeah. Fire away.

10:16.198 --> 10:20.660
"What can I say about
the incredible Mary Matrix?"

10:20.661 --> 10:22.621
That's it. That's... All I got.

10:24.039 --> 10:26.291
Oh.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.084
Okay. Um...

10:28.085 --> 10:29.753
Not a bad start.

10:29.753 --> 10:32.839
But are you... if you're
asking me for my advice,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.092
I would probably
start off, like,

10:35.092 --> 10:37.135
telling a joke
and then maybe segue

10:37.136 --> 10:39.596
to a couple heartwarming
anecdotes.

10:39.596 --> 10:41.598
I don't really have
anything like that.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.393
Well, sure you do. I mean...

10:44.393 --> 10:48.271
You know, like fond memories
with your mom, you know,

10:48.272 --> 10:52.317
like, uh, birthday parties
or graduation,

10:52.317 --> 10:54.652
maybe fragging newbs together.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.237
Just you know... you know,

10:56.238 --> 10:58.657
like cute mother-daughter
kind of stuff, um...

10:58.657 --> 11:01.534
You know, just to say
something nice about your mom.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.204
I can't.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.709
I mean, I can't think of anything.
I don't...

11:09.710 --> 11:12.796
I don't have anything
to say about my mom.

11:12.796 --> 11:15.340
Jenny.

11:16.633 --> 11:17.675
Hey.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.584
Hi.

11:52.127 --> 11:53.211
Hey.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.174
Thanks for listening to
my crap last night.

11:58.926 --> 11:59.968
Of course.

12:04.389 --> 12:06.057
Jeez, it's 10:15.
The brunch is...

12:06.058 --> 12:07.559
Mom!

12:07.559 --> 12:09.686
Mom! M-Mary! Coach!

12:09.686 --> 12:12.855
Hey, Brian, don't you have
some tables to wait on?

12:12.856 --> 12:14.774
Oh, crap. Calhoun's
gonna kill me.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.859
Just go, Brian.

12:15.859 --> 12:17.485
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.405
It's okay.

12:20.405 --> 12:21.614
Um, nothing happened.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.866
Sorry.

12:22.866 --> 12:24.367
Jeez, mom, heard of knocking?

12:24.368 --> 12:27.496
Get down there. Now.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.713
I must say,
your professor Layton

12:37.714 --> 12:40.174
has no understanding
of where the puzzle genre

12:40.175 --> 12:42.969
fits into caillois'
four categories of play.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.222
They teach you to play
games here, father.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.473
It isn't carnegie mellon.

12:46.473 --> 12:48.975
Clearly. Have you
learned anything here?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.644
Of course.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.188
Except for Freddie's class,
but I dropped that one.

12:53.188 --> 12:54.564
You're dropping classes?

12:54.564 --> 12:56.274
Oh, look, my R.A. Board.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.321
This is where I schedule
activities and chores

13:01.321 --> 13:03.406
for the entire floor.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.451
Wendell! Did you
clean the bathroom?

13:06.451 --> 13:08.995
Um... yeah.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.330
Wendell.

13:10.330 --> 13:11.664
Uh... no.

13:17.462 --> 13:19.464
With all this middle
management work,

13:19.464 --> 13:21.299
ll hope you're still
finding the time

13:21.300 --> 13:22.968
to flex your creative muscles.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.803
Oh, I sure do.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.596
In fact, as R.A.,

13:26.596 --> 13:30.141
ll flex my way around creative
challenges all the time.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.561
<i>- Shane!
- 'M a busy man, Ki!</i>

13:32.561 --> 13:34.563
What did you think of
my creative ideas for...

13:34.563 --> 13:36.314
I think I don't care
about you, your job,

13:36.315 --> 13:39.443
or finishing
this sentence, so...

13:39.443 --> 13:41.069
That's my boss.

13:41.069 --> 13:42.820
He prefers negative
reinforcement.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.864
Hmm.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.868
But I saved the most
positive reinforcement

13:47.868 --> 13:50.829
of the idea of why this
school is really great for me

13:50.829 --> 13:53.498
and why I should
stay here for last...

13:53.498 --> 13:56.042
My boyfriend, Ted.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.754
Ovulations, old bean.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.680
And why are your assault
players using acog scopes?

14:08.680 --> 14:11.224
In my day, all we needed
was a simple foregrip.

14:11.224 --> 14:14.143
Countess Kelly,
may I present my daugther,

14:14.144 --> 14:15.895
Jenny Matrix.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.564
Sorry I'm late, ma'am.

14:17.564 --> 14:21.109
A good varsity captain should
always be punctual, Jenny,

14:21.109 --> 14:23.319
and barring that they should
be able to manufacture

14:23.320 --> 14:25.196
a decent excuse.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.033
Yeah, I was up
all night with a friend

14:29.034 --> 14:32.370
writing a speech
about my wonderful mother.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.331
We lost track of time, he and I.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.041
He and I?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.667
Am I to understand
you're late for brunch

14:37.667 --> 14:40.961
because you had a boy
in your room all night?

14:40.962 --> 14:43.839
I am hungry! Where's Brian?

14:43.840 --> 14:46.509
Ernie! Women are talking!

14:46.510 --> 14:50.514
Now, Jenny, why don't you tell
us about this boy friend of yours

14:50.514 --> 14:53.725
who's occupying
your valuable time.

14:55.018 --> 14:57.020
Hello. Um...

14:57.020 --> 15:01.357
My name is Brian.
I will be your server today.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.776
We'll all have tuna.

15:04.152 --> 15:06.112
I'm sorry I'm late.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.323
I'm allergic to tuna!

15:08.323 --> 15:09.907
Okay.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.924
What? That's impossible!

15:25.924 --> 15:27.967
No! No!

15:29.177 --> 15:31.012
Hey there, short stack.

15:33.932 --> 15:37.977
Ha ha ha ha ha!

15:40.397 --> 15:41.940
Learning a valuable lesson

15:41.940 --> 15:45.193
about respecting the people
you've hurt in the past?

15:47.362 --> 15:49.030
Well, don't!

15:51.450 --> 15:53.618
Who...

15:53.618 --> 15:55.202
What are you?

15:55.203 --> 15:57.580
I'm the best version of you
that ever existed.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.708
The pride before the fall.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.876
The cool before the storm.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.546
I'm the Law,

16:04.546 --> 16:06.548
and you're just a stooge,

16:06.548 --> 16:08.883
a patsy,

16:08.884 --> 16:10.552
the chubby dillweed
every crew jock

16:10.552 --> 16:13.596
used to wedgie into their
lockers in middle school.

16:13.597 --> 16:17.517
Now you're just
Lawrence Pemberton.

16:17.517 --> 16:21.229
Never say that name to me!

16:21.229 --> 16:23.481
Okay, jeez.
Switch to decaf, kemosabe.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.650
Which is why you must
remain focused.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.026
Yes, ma'am, ll completely agree.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.946
A varsity captain
keeps her skills leet

16:29.946 --> 16:31.989
and her social calendar cleared

16:31.990 --> 16:34.200
so she can practice,
practice, practice.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.911
Yes, ma'am, ll completely agree.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.288
Especially when she only
received her station

16:38.288 --> 16:40.206
through her mother's
intervention

16:40.207 --> 16:42.876
and the uprupt meltdown
of her ex-boyfriend,

16:42.876 --> 16:45.128
which leads me back to my point:

16:45.128 --> 16:46.587
No boyfriends.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.089
Okay, lady, you know what?

16:48.089 --> 16:51.050
I agree. If I ever caught
two of my players dating,

16:51.051 --> 16:54.471
I would bench them both
for the rest of the season.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.014
Got it?

16:56.014 --> 16:58.016
I do, and I like it.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.143
Just the sort of discipline

17:00.143 --> 17:03.312
I'd expect from parent
of the year.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.646
Let's eat.

17:04.647 --> 17:09.147
Now, Mary, let's talk
knife-running.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.196
Ernie! Is that
a bacon cheeseburger?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.449
I didn't even...
I didn't even order this!

17:14.449 --> 17:15.449
Brian!

17:20.664 --> 17:23.083
I'm sorry. I will
fix this immediately.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.420
That boy is an idiot!

17:27.420 --> 17:29.213
He's my friend.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.423
I beg your pardon.

17:30.423 --> 17:32.049
Brian, he's my friend.

17:32.050 --> 17:34.135
And my personal life
is none of your business.

17:34.135 --> 17:36.095
We are not talking
about this right now.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.640
Yeah, we are. You can't just
waltz back into my life...

17:38.640 --> 17:41.225
Yes, I can. I'm your mother.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.894
Since when?

17:47.274 --> 17:50.193
Will someone get
that man a tuna?

17:52.362 --> 17:56.074
Well, sorry if I appeared
so dumb before, Kenneth.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.408
I'm not!

17:58.868 --> 18:00.995
May I fetch you a pizza dunks?

18:00.996 --> 18:02.247
I'll just have
some water, thanks.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.916
Ah, a water man! Fine taste.

18:04.916 --> 18:08.669
I admire a dad with
a sophisticated phallus.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.672
You know what, sport?

18:10.672 --> 18:12.715
Let's just get down
to brass tacks.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.093
Okay.

18:15.093 --> 18:17.637
Ted. That's short for Edward?

18:17.637 --> 18:19.430
Theodore.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.433
Ah, Greek, from "god's gift."

18:21.433 --> 18:22.851
Ted wong...

18:22.851 --> 18:25.103
Your parents must think
very highly of you!

18:26.730 --> 18:29.733
No, thank you, I already ate.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.985
You like my daughter?

18:31.985 --> 18:34.320
Uh, yes, very much.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.073
Do you two get up
to much kissing?

18:37.073 --> 18:39.617
No! Yes!

18:39.618 --> 18:42.954
I mean, maybe... Perhaps.

18:42.954 --> 18:45.122
Let's get back
to those brass taxes.

18:45.123 --> 18:47.333
I mean, do we really need them?

18:47.334 --> 18:49.002
Discuss.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.753
Let's discuss what you do know

18:50.754 --> 18:52.547
you do with my daughter.

18:52.547 --> 18:54.632
Uh, well, um...

18:54.633 --> 18:56.343
We go to class.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.844
We talk.

18:57.844 --> 19:00.012
And yoga.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.681
And every sunday
we get up extra early

19:01.681 --> 19:03.766
and make those little
pancake balls.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.060
They're so cute.
What are they called again, Ki?

19:06.061 --> 19:09.189
Ebelskivers.
They're called ebelskivers,

19:09.189 --> 19:10.940
and we used to make them
every sunda morning,

19:10.940 --> 19:12.983
before our family walk.

19:12.984 --> 19:14.986
I've seen all I need to see.

19:14.986 --> 19:16.529
You can go.

19:16.529 --> 19:18.822
Oh, um...

19:18.823 --> 19:20.115
Okay.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.745
It was very nice to meet you.

19:31.586 --> 19:34.297
That was very rude, father.

19:34.297 --> 19:35.840
Let's review.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.300
You stay up late,
you eat junk food,

19:38.301 --> 19:40.636
you're dropping classes,
which doesn't seem to matter,

19:40.637 --> 19:41.929
"cause you're not
learning anything,"

19:41.930 --> 19:43.932
but worst of all,
your art is suffering.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.850
I like it here.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.685
I'm making friends.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.770
The less said
about Ted the better.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.937
As for your other friends,

19:49.938 --> 19:51.397
ll don't see hide
nor hair of them.

19:51.398 --> 19:54.609
Is someone having
imaginary friends again?

19:54.609 --> 19:58.404
I am not! They are
real and wonderful,

19:58.405 --> 20:01.574
and not jerks.

20:01.574 --> 20:03.033
Like you.

20:03.034 --> 20:06.078
I'm sorry that you
feel that way,

20:06.079 --> 20:07.955
but you asked
for a performance review,

20:07.956 --> 20:10.750
and you failed it.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.251
You're coming home, Ki.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.516
Hey.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.937
Sorry about all... that.

20:33.064 --> 20:34.356
Yikes.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.403
You know, I don't think
there's enough ice cream

20:38.403 --> 20:40.571
in the entire world
to deal with that bunch.

20:44.659 --> 20:47.203
But... I did find
a piece of gum.

20:48.496 --> 20:49.955
Sugar-free.

20:49.956 --> 20:52.667
But we have to split it,

20:52.667 --> 20:54.460
"cause I've had
a pretty rough day myself."

20:58.298 --> 20:59.340
Cheers.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.434
I'll give you a thousand bucks
to give this speech for me.

21:13.354 --> 21:14.688
Nah, you'll be fine.

21:14.689 --> 21:18.484
I mean, it does suck...

21:18.485 --> 21:21.404
But she's your mom,

21:21.404 --> 21:23.948
and you have to do this.

21:23.948 --> 21:25.824
And you'll deal.

21:25.825 --> 21:29.078
Yeah. I'll deal.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.251
Okay. Well, I have
to get back to work.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.540
Kiwi?

22:14.541 --> 22:16.584
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

22:16.584 --> 22:19.753
I downloaded some swell gregorian
chants for the ride home.

22:19.754 --> 22:22.173
That's very considerate, father.

22:30.431 --> 22:32.516
Father, do you mind if we play
that last game of pokermon

22:32.517 --> 22:33.601
before we go?

22:33.601 --> 22:35.227
Whatever my little girl wants.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.855
What's your wager?

22:37.856 --> 22:39.816
My freedom!

22:39.816 --> 22:43.611
Honey, why delay the inevitable?
I always win.

22:43.611 --> 22:46.572
But if I win, I stay at VGHS.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.783
If you win, which you won't,

22:48.783 --> 22:51.202
I'll do the dishes
on Wednesday nights.

22:51.202 --> 22:53.579
Lasagna night.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.623
You are desperate.

22:55.623 --> 22:58.917
Very well. Let's pokermon.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.616
Almost nothing!

24:14.994 --> 24:16.370
Whoa! Yeah!

24:16.371 --> 24:18.456
Ha ha ha ha ha!

24:18.456 --> 24:19.957
Whoo!

24:19.958 --> 24:22.293
I'm back!

24:22.293 --> 24:25.921
No one can beat the Law
except the Law!

24:25.922 --> 24:30.422
Ki, your game has problems!

24:30.551 --> 24:31.718
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

24:31.719 --> 24:33.971
Oh, dude, Law!
Put some pants on, man!

24:33.972 --> 24:35.473
Make an effort. Do something.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.641
Never!

24:37.642 --> 24:40.353
Never again!

24:40.353 --> 24:42.355
Ha ha ha ha ha!

25:03.126 --> 25:06.879
What can I say about
the great Mary Matrix?

25:06.879 --> 25:10.132
Um, well, stay away from
her meatloaf, for one.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.392
You've all heard of Mary Matrix.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.143
Some of you might even know her,

25:21.144 --> 25:24.814
but I'm the only one
who gets to call her mom.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.816
And, uh...

25:26.816 --> 25:30.361
Right from the beginning,
I wanted to be my mom.

25:30.361 --> 25:33.155
Frag bowl 23,
wildcats vs. Warriors,

25:33.156 --> 25:36.159
and she was eight months
pregnant with me.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.120
I've seen the clips, mom,
you were huge.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.372
So...

25:41.372 --> 25:44.166
It's the final round.
There's four minutes left in the game

25:44.167 --> 25:45.960
and her team's down
by five points,

25:45.960 --> 25:49.380
and she goes into labor,
but you didn't stop.

25:49.380 --> 25:53.092
You just kept playing, and you
brought your team a miracle.

25:53.092 --> 25:56.095
The wildcats
won by three points.

25:56.095 --> 25:59.014
And then you had me
right there in the arena.

25:59.015 --> 26:02.560
I didn't even give you time
to get to the hospital.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.562
I think...

26:04.562 --> 26:08.023
I just wanted
to meet you so bad:

26:08.024 --> 26:10.776
The Boston banshee,
the siren of death.

26:10.777 --> 26:14.405
Twenty-two years old,
and five championship titles.

26:14.405 --> 26:16.865
Sorry I almost
lost you your sixth.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.830
While you were away, dad and I,
we would watch every game,

26:22.830 --> 26:25.582
every press conference,
every interview.

26:25.583 --> 26:29.211
Your commitment to the game
left me in awe,

26:29.212 --> 26:33.591
so when I started playing,
ll took your handle:

26:33.591 --> 26:37.219
Matrix. Jenny Matrix.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.598
Because you weren't just my mom,

26:40.598 --> 26:42.057
you were my hero.

26:47.438 --> 26:49.481
Well, you all know
the rest of the story:

26:49.482 --> 26:51.442
Star player becomes star coach,

26:51.442 --> 26:53.360
and now she's here.

26:53.361 --> 26:56.447
So it is my honor
to present Mary Matrix

26:56.447 --> 26:59.825
with the pta's parent
of the year award.

26:59.826 --> 27:00.868
I love you, mom.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.417
Was that so hard?

27:13.673 --> 27:16.133
Thank you. Thank you very much.

27:18.469 --> 27:21.555
Well, honey, here we are again.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.807
So...

27:24.016 --> 27:25.809
Am I bluffing?

27:29.981 --> 27:31.190
Hey, guys.

27:31.190 --> 27:33.650
Um...

27:33.651 --> 27:36.862
Mr. Swan, I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

27:36.863 --> 27:37.905
I'm really sorry.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.158
Hey.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.119
What's going on?

27:43.119 --> 27:46.664
Ted, what would you do if I
had to go home for a while?

27:46.664 --> 27:50.668
Oh, i-l don't know. I mean,
I'd miss you a whole bunch,

27:50.668 --> 27:54.171
I'd be really sad, but if you
really had to leave,

27:54.172 --> 27:55.631
I'd understand.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.681
You're a genius.

28:04.932 --> 28:06.892
I fold.

28:06.893 --> 28:08.603
Interesting.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.688
You win, but I'm
calling your bluff.

28:10.688 --> 28:11.980
You won't take me home.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.108
If Ted is mature enough
to let me leave,

28:14.108 --> 28:16.360
you definitely are.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.653
This isn't about VGHS;

28:18.654 --> 28:21.531
This is about me
growing up without you.

28:21.532 --> 28:23.242
And it hurts.

28:23.242 --> 28:26.370
It's classic
empty nest syndrome.

28:26.370 --> 28:30.123
I'm sorry, dad,
but I'm calling your bluff.

28:30.124 --> 28:31.959
I'll bet you didn't expect that.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.670
It was expected.

28:40.551 --> 28:43.053
But I didn't expect it so soon.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.312
Father.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.734
- I love you.
- I love you too, kiwi.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.571
Hey, uh, Mr. Swan.

29:00.571 --> 29:02.072
Um, would it be okay
if me and Ki

29:02.073 --> 29:03.532
came over on the weekends?

29:03.532 --> 29:05.158
We shall make evil beavers.

29:05.159 --> 29:08.162
My daughter's right.

29:08.162 --> 29:09.746
You're a genius.

29:09.747 --> 29:11.999
Evil beavers it is.

29:31.727 --> 29:33.854
You sure?
