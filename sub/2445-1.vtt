00:20.751 --> 00:21.709
Even if

00:22.209 --> 00:24.334
To the very last heartbeat

00:25.751 --> 00:27.459
I have to make sure my opponent...

00:28.459 --> 00:29.376
Falls!

01:50.209 --> 01:51.293
I can't die

01:51.959 --> 01:53.793
Because I tell myself

01:54.709 --> 01:55.834
lam invincible

02:00.293 --> 02:00.918
Father

02:08.793 --> 02:10.334
Poor kid!

02:24.126 --> 02:25.126
<i>BOY</i>

02:26.876 --> 02:27.959
Fei! My medical box

02:28.001 --> 02:28.501
Yes

02:30.334 --> 02:31.001
I'm back

02:32.168 --> 02:33.667
Eat or it'll be cold!

02:33.668 --> 02:34.168
Yes!

02:35.501 --> 02:38.001
I'll use acupuncture to
stimulate his energy

02:38.459 --> 02:40.376
When it flows smoothly, one lives

02:40.418 --> 02:42.334
When it reverses, one dies

02:42.668 --> 02:45.792
It's very important to us
martial arts practitioners

02:45.793 --> 02:47.167
Remember every vital point I've taught you

02:47.168 --> 02:47.668
Yes

02:48.334 --> 02:48.834
Father

02:49.834 --> 02:51.334
The other boy died

02:51.918 --> 02:53.376
Will he die too?

02:54.334 --> 02:55.334
I'll try my best

02:56.251 --> 02:57.691
A cold pathogen has entered his body

02:58.168 --> 02:59.709
Plus he's underfed

03:00.334 --> 03:01.418
It's useless!

03:01.709 --> 03:02.834
You can't save him!

03:03.626 --> 03:04.709
Always remember

03:05.293 --> 03:08.376
Never give up no matter how hopeless

03:13.376 --> 03:14.793
I won't let you die

03:15.418 --> 03:16.376
You have to get up!

03:16.793 --> 03:17.793
You're not going to die

03:18.709 --> 03:21.168
You can have my peanuts

03:21.959 --> 03:22.918
Get up!

03:28.751 --> 03:29.876
Listen

03:30.168 --> 03:31.459
My name is Wong Fei Hung

03:31.918 --> 03:33.418
People call me Little Fei

03:33.709 --> 03:34.959
I tell myself I'm invincible

03:35.709 --> 03:36.918
Why am I so strong?

03:37.376 --> 03:38.751
Let me tell you why

03:39.209 --> 03:40.330
It's because I am invincible

03:58.418 --> 04:00.876
This isn't the first corpse lost at sea

04:01.751 --> 04:05.918
Many workers have gone missing
from the Black Tiger Gang warehouse

04:06.209 --> 04:08.751
This worker reported it to the magistracy

04:08.793 --> 04:11.126
In the end, he too, disappeared

04:32.251 --> 04:34.459
This is the Guangzhou
Pearl River delta area

04:34.834 --> 04:38.293
Also known as China's Marine Silk Road

04:38.834 --> 04:42.334
It used to be a prosperous seaward passage
for foreign trade

04:42.668 --> 04:46.958
But with the Qing Dynasty
maritime trade ban and the Opium War,

04:46.959 --> 04:49.668
former glory was lost forever

05:57.876 --> 05:59.793
This warehouse belongs
to the Black Tiger Gang

06:00.251 --> 06:04.168
They and the North Sea Gang
dominate the pier

06:09.793 --> 06:11.708
The two gangs fought for many years

06:11.709 --> 06:13.792
For the rights to control the pier

06:13.793 --> 06:16.834
And monopolize the lucrative foreign trade

06:22.126 --> 06:23.751
Besides the business from the pier

06:23.918 --> 06:27.418
They also own opium dens,
gambling houses and brothels

06:28.793 --> 06:29.834
Hurry! hurry!

06:30.251 --> 06:32.293
Move those over here

06:32.834 --> 06:34.668
Be careful! Be careful!

06:35.126 --> 06:36.834
Come on, keep moving!

06:37.668 --> 06:38.168
Hurry!

06:42.168 --> 06:43.168
Hurry UP!

06:43.418 --> 06:44.918
Get a move on!

06:46.668 --> 06:47.709
Hurry!

06:48.668 --> 06:50.376
Move all that stuff!

07:07.376 --> 07:09.668
Additional 100 workers!

07:12.626 --> 07:13.584
Hiring!

07:16.084 --> 07:19.334
Pay your dues and you get hired

07:19.751 --> 07:22.292
Without a penny, there's only luck

07:22.293 --> 07:23.459
You five, go on in!

07:23.793 --> 07:24.959
Move over here! Over here!

07:25.126 --> 07:25.793
You! Come over

07:26.626 --> 07:28.834
My dear...

07:30.251 --> 07:32.459
Wake up, please wake up!

07:37.959 --> 07:40.168
Please wake up!

07:46.918 --> 07:49.793
This pier belongs to the Black Tiger Gang

07:52.751 --> 07:54.271
Who dares to report to the magistracy?

07:55.376 --> 07:58.959
What's there to see? Get lost!

07:59.043 --> 08:00.751
Go. Get lost!

08:00.834 --> 08:02.709
The Black Tiger Gang has three honchos

08:02.834 --> 08:05.251
This is the bloodthirsty First Tiger

08:09.709 --> 08:10.709
Go! Get lost!

08:17.418 --> 08:20.208
This gang-controlled pier

08:20.209 --> 08:21.833
is the foreign traders' paradise

08:21.834 --> 08:24.126
but an inferno for dock workers

08:35.668 --> 08:36.333
Place your bets!

08:37.126 --> 08:37.668
Hurry!

08:37.751 --> 08:39.126
Place your bets!

08:39.333 --> 08:41.376
The next one must be Big!

08:41.833 --> 08:44.168
Show! Show! Show!

08:44.334 --> 08:46.709
Young Master,
the daredevil warriors have arrived

08:47.668 --> 08:49.334
Banker takes all! Collect all bets!

08:52.959 --> 08:53.709
What're you doing?

08:54.168 --> 08:56.209
What? So what?!

08:56.793 --> 08:59.251
This is the gold-digging Second Tiger

08:59.709 --> 09:02.251
Master, I handpicked these girls

09:06.126 --> 09:07.406
Send them to the courtesan boats

09:08.084 --> 09:10.209
Leave her to me

09:16.251 --> 09:19.084
This is the lecherous Third Tiger

09:19.876 --> 09:21.276
The daredevil warriors have arrived

09:21.584 --> 09:22.084
Good

09:26.751 --> 09:28.751
I've been in the gang for six years

09:29.251 --> 09:33.251
Never thought I'll have a chance
to meet the master

09:34.668 --> 09:36.126
Hey Brother!

09:36.918 --> 09:39.918
Everyone calls me Big Tooth.
What's your name?

09:44.668 --> 09:45.584
He's got no manners

09:46.209 --> 09:48.251
You know why we're here?

09:49.126 --> 09:52.793
My senior asked me
to replace him to see the Master

09:52.834 --> 09:55.251
It's a chance for me to widen my eyes

09:55.418 --> 09:56.251
And I...

09:56.376 --> 09:57.293
have decided...

09:57.668 --> 09:59.834
to become the Forth Tiger
of the Black Tiger Gang

10:00.251 --> 10:03.626
You know why the gang master
wants to see us?

10:06.168 --> 10:06.668
This...

10:07.209 --> 10:09.793
is a promise I made to my Brother

10:19.793 --> 10:21.354
Master, the daredevil warriors are here

10:25.168 --> 10:28.959
They are the best junior chiefs who've been
with us for more than five years

10:34.209 --> 10:35.376
Greetings to you, Master!

10:36.793 --> 10:40.668
How dare you betrayed the gang
and burnt our laborer boat

10:42.334 --> 10:45.668
Tell us the names of your conspirators

10:46.001 --> 10:49.751
Perhaps the Master would spare your life!

10:50.251 --> 10:50.751
No way!

10:51.834 --> 10:53.418
I'll never betray my buddies!

10:53.501 --> 10:58.459
You kidnapped and sold us workers
to the foreigners as forced labor

10:58.793 --> 10:59.834
It's god-forbidden!

11:00.876 --> 11:04.918
We're not paid to be sold as cheap goods

11:05.459 --> 11:11.418
We're flesh and blood,
with wives and families, not your...

11:19.709 --> 11:22.376
There's a price to be a hero

11:22.876 --> 11:24.168
Why didn't you duck?

11:24.668 --> 11:25.668
Because I am not afraid

11:26.168 --> 11:27.251
Why aren't you afraid?

11:29.918 --> 11:32.376
Just not afraid

11:35.793 --> 11:36.459
Grant tea!

12:23.834 --> 12:24.668
Drink up!

12:32.751 --> 12:38.709
Whoever can bring me back
the head of North Sea Gang master,

12:38.918 --> 12:42.293
will be doing the Gang
a distinguished service

12:42.668 --> 12:46.750
Whoever achieves this,
I will break the gang rule

12:46.751 --> 12:49.334
and take him as my forth adopted son!

12:55.876 --> 12:59.793
We swear to bring back
the head of the North Sea Gang master!

13:10.709 --> 13:11.626
North Sea Gang master

13:25.293 --> 13:28.168
If I don't kill you today

13:29.126 --> 13:30.459
I won't leave here alive either!

18:38.168 --> 18:39.209
Father!

18:44.793 --> 18:45.709
Move!

19:05.834 --> 19:06.834
Move away!

19:09.126 --> 19:09.876
Move!

19:30.376 --> 19:31.625
Master!

19:31.626 --> 19:32.168
Father!

19:32.334 --> 19:34.209
Father!

19:43.793 --> 19:45.293
He's my adopted son!

19:45.691 --> 19:47.292
I don't want him dead! I want him alive!

19:47.293 --> 19:48.668
Yes! Father!

19:48.876 --> 19:52.208
We'll get the best doctor to nurse him back

19:52.209 --> 19:56.293
None of you can bring me
the head of that North Sea Gang master

19:56.793 --> 19:58.334
Either you're taking it easy

19:58.418 --> 20:00.178
or focus too much time
on fighting each other

20:00.376 --> 20:01.937
You've lost the killer instinct he has!

20:02.209 --> 20:02.709
Yes!

20:02.793 --> 20:03.709
Master is right!

20:04.334 --> 20:06.709
Congratulations on
taking another adopted son!

20:06.876 --> 20:10.293
Congratulations on
taking another adopted son!

20:10.834 --> 20:12.293
Hang the severed head on the arch

20:12.668 --> 20:16.418
Let everybody know
who is in control of the pier now!

20:16.709 --> 20:17.293
Yes!

20:24.376 --> 20:27.668
You can't die! Can't die just like that

20:28.376 --> 20:30.209
Not easy for you to get such a position

20:30.459 --> 20:33.418
These wounds would be been worthless!

20:34.418 --> 20:35.334
I'm lucky

20:35.834 --> 20:38.793
After all I can have a decent meal

20:39.459 --> 20:40.918
You have to get well no matter what!

20:42.376 --> 20:42.876
Yeah

20:44.376 --> 20:45.376
Why waited for me?

20:46.376 --> 20:47.876
You've saved me once, remember?

20:48.418 --> 20:50.834
On the ninth of last month at the theatre

20:51.376 --> 20:51.918
You forgot?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.418
You've mistaken

20:54.501 --> 20:55.834
No way!

20:55.918 --> 20:59.209
You look so ugly.
I can't possibly make a mistake

21:01.918 --> 21:05.293
Anyway, we're buddies now!

21:12.168 --> 21:18.251
I always want to follow a tough guy,
and be a tough guy

21:18.376 --> 21:21.834
My father used to be a great boxer

21:22.376 --> 21:24.834
His Eight Trigram Pole was formidable

21:25.334 --> 21:29.209
But he got addicted to
opium and sold my siblings

21:30.709 --> 21:34.459
Enough of him! Let me tell you my story...

21:35.293 --> 21:37.334
I'm actually a good man

21:37.793 --> 21:40.418
I wasn't like this seven years ago...

21:47.334 --> 21:48.876
Hey, wake up!

21:52.709 --> 21:54.251
If you don't want me to die

21:55.209 --> 21:56.334
Shut up!

22:04.668 --> 22:08.168
Rest well, don't talk too much

22:33.376 --> 22:36.251
Once I master this, I'll teach Little Fiery

22:36.876 --> 22:37.751
I don't want to learn

22:40.209 --> 22:40.876
Play it again

22:41.001 --> 22:42.501
Brother Fei!

22:47.501 --> 22:49.251
Little Fa is in trouble

22:49.376 --> 22:51.293
The villainous Master Li
has to take her away

22:52.834 --> 22:53.751
Let's go!

22:53.793 --> 22:54.293
Go!

22:56.876 --> 22:57.834
Move! Move!

22:59.376 --> 23:01.293
Let go of her!

23:01.793 --> 23:04.709
Please let go of my daughter! I beg you!

23:04.876 --> 23:05.376
Mom!

23:05.377 --> 23:06.625
Please let her go!

23:06.626 --> 23:07.209
Move!

23:11.626 --> 23:12.793
I'll kill you!

23:42.626 --> 23:44.266
That's the head of North Sea Gang master!

23:47.751 --> 23:50.876
No

23:52.626 --> 23:53.917
Don't

23:53.918 --> 23:55.709
Father, forgive me

23:58.793 --> 24:00.626
for not being a filial son

24:02.543 --> 24:03.959
Young Master

24:06.751 --> 24:08.126
I swear

24:09.834 --> 24:13.626
to avenge your death!

24:16.626 --> 24:19.459
My father has been killed
by the Black Tiger Gang

24:19.918 --> 24:22.918
And you offer all business
of your five ships to them?

24:24.543 --> 24:28.709
The North Sea Gang
has never had any problems before...

24:30.126 --> 24:32.959
Even the opium dens followed your rules

24:34.126 --> 24:35.501
What is the meaning of this?

24:35.793 --> 24:37.209
You've no regards
for principles of the underworld?

24:37.793 --> 24:39.501
I don't know the rules of your underworld

24:39.793 --> 24:43.001
The struggle between you
and Black Tiger Gang

24:43.251 --> 24:44.834
We don't care

24:44.959 --> 24:47.001
Whoever has leverage here,

24:47.293 --> 24:50.168
the foreign traders
will do business with them

24:50.959 --> 24:51.668
Alright!

24:54.751 --> 24:55.751
You'll see!

25:09.793 --> 25:10.668
Young Master

25:11.626 --> 25:13.126
You've been burnt?

25:15.126 --> 25:16.126
When I was young...

25:17.126 --> 25:18.584
Scars are for life!

25:18.918 --> 25:20.668
It must be god's will!

25:21.709 --> 25:24.876
This scar looks just like a tiger!

25:27.709 --> 25:30.500
You're now the gang's adopted son

25:30.501 --> 25:35.668
On a par with North Evil,
Black Crow, Old Snake

25:35.834 --> 25:39.543
To help Master take care
of business at the pier

25:40.251 --> 25:43.293
The opium den,
gambling parlor, courtesan boat

25:43.793 --> 25:46.209
And the money vault...

25:47.501 --> 25:50.209
Money earned from the businesses
is kept in the vault?

25:50.543 --> 25:55.209
Two keys are required to open it,
a gold and a silver one

25:55.626 --> 25:58.209
Master Lei owns a set

25:58.543 --> 26:02.751
The other set is held by the two sons
with the most profitable business

26:04.709 --> 26:07.543
Which two have the best performance now?

26:07.584 --> 26:09.875
Of course it's Black Crow
who handles the gambling parlors

26:09.876 --> 26:12.918
And the crafty Old Snake!

26:13.459 --> 26:17.251
Both must be present
to gain access to the vault

26:17.459 --> 26:20.668
To monitor each other
and share responsibility,

26:21.543 --> 26:24.125
no one else has the key

26:24.126 --> 26:26.751
It's useless even if you know the location

26:27.709 --> 26:29.584
Little Fa has been taken by Villain Li

26:30.251 --> 26:33.543
Father! I beg you, please kill him

26:34.251 --> 26:37.793
There're more than
one villain in this world

26:48.709 --> 26:50.543
Dad! Kill him!

26:52.793 --> 26:53.542
Where's she?

26:53.543 --> 26:56.293
I already sold her, no use in beating me!

27:23.251 --> 27:25.459
Come on board to relax, Master!

27:26.501 --> 27:29.209
Hey Master! Our girls
will sing and dance for you

27:54.918 --> 27:56.293
Thank you, Forth Young Master!

27:57.793 --> 27:59.834
My family will have fish porridge tonight!

28:09.448 --> 28:11.208
In honor of the ancestors
of the Lei family,

28:11.209 --> 28:16.501
from this day on, I hereby announce,
Fei as my forth adopted son!

28:25.918 --> 28:28.668
Father, please have this tea

28:29.459 --> 28:32.543
Congratulations Master Lei
on your four distinguished sons!

28:33.126 --> 28:35.367
Today Master Lei celebrates the adoption
of his forth son

28:35.793 --> 28:37.584
We have waited long enough

28:38.501 --> 28:39.001
Come!

28:40.543 --> 28:42.626
We, the Orphan Gang

28:43.126 --> 28:45.501
Shall stand up against the Black Tiger Gang

28:46.126 --> 28:48.209
And pay respect to
all the lost souls at the pier!

28:48.543 --> 28:49.834
Brothers! Drink up!

28:50.209 --> 28:51.251
Drink up!

28:53.709 --> 28:55.251
Yes!

29:00.209 --> 29:04.084
If you want to command respect

29:04.668 --> 29:06.751
You need to let people fear you

29:08.209 --> 29:10.626
If someone dares to defy you,

29:10.918 --> 29:13.584
it's is because you're no longer a threat

29:22.209 --> 29:25.168
Eliminate the North Sea Gang
once and for all

29:25.876 --> 29:28.793
And let the people know who's is in charge

29:31.626 --> 29:34.709
This year the Black Tiger Gang
ruthlessly pursued it's enemies,

29:35.126 --> 29:38.126
while the son of the North Sea Gang
avenges his father's death

29:43.793 --> 29:45.959
And as I had predicted,

29:46.459 --> 29:49.793
the Black Tiger Gang
finally took over the pier

30:10.543 --> 30:11.293
And I

30:11.876 --> 30:15.501
truly became another vicious Tiger
under Master Lei

30:18.168 --> 30:18.959
Go! Get lost!

30:53.543 --> 30:54.543
Fei

30:56.918 --> 30:57.709
Father!

31:03.834 --> 31:04.793
Little Fa!

31:17.709 --> 31:19.793
You've cried out the name
Little Fa thrice tonight

31:20.209 --> 31:21.709
Bad dream again?

31:25.668 --> 31:29.668
Maybe Little Fa
has drifted into prostitution

31:30.668 --> 31:31.709
How about this

31:32.751 --> 31:34.501
You can call me Fa if you like

31:34.959 --> 31:36.584
Perhaps it can ease your longing

31:36.626 --> 31:37.251
No

31:40.543 --> 31:43.334
Sorry, no offense

31:44.334 --> 31:47.584
I understand, don't be so serious

31:50.293 --> 31:55.709
I know, you despise me
for being a prostitute

32:00.251 --> 32:03.126
My hands are filled with blood,
I'm not pure as well

32:04.459 --> 32:06.834
It's fine as long as the heart remains pure

32:17.959 --> 32:21.834
My father, a brilliant doctor
and a master at Tiger-Crane double fist,

32:23.168 --> 32:25.918
started the medical hall to save
the lives of those in need

32:26.584 --> 32:30.501
Yet in the end,
he lost to the might of a torch

32:43.751 --> 32:46.626
Save us!

32:47.293 --> 32:49.626
Quick, get out!

32:52.709 --> 32:54.542
Fei, take them away from here first

32:54.543 --> 32:56.751
Father! Teacher!

32:58.501 --> 32:59.582
Have you seen Little Fiery?

32:59.709 --> 33:00.668
No

33:02.793 --> 33:04.751
Fiery! Fiery!

33:09.834 --> 33:10.751
Little Fiery!

33:13.168 --> 33:16.834
Leave me! Go before it's too late!

33:17.501 --> 33:19.834
We'll be brothers again in our next life!

33:19.959 --> 33:21.280
I don't care about the next life!

33:21.501 --> 33:23.834
Your life is my life now!

33:35.668 --> 33:36.751
Go!

33:39.918 --> 33:40.668
Father!

33:45.751 --> 33:50.334
Teacher! Teacher!

34:01.501 --> 34:02.221
This way please...

34:06.126 --> 34:07.166
Young forth Master is here

34:07.918 --> 34:09.668
Young forth Master!

34:11.208 --> 34:11.708
Please

34:12.126 --> 34:14.792
Come let's toast to him!

34:14.793 --> 34:16.126
Yes!

34:16.793 --> 34:18.543
Forth Master, please

34:19.208 --> 34:20.208
Sit!

34:46.583 --> 34:52.501
Why does Brother North Evil
carry a cane like an old man?

34:56.543 --> 34:57.751
He's talking about me

34:58.209 --> 34:59.751
You find that funny?

35:02.751 --> 35:05.834
I want to make a toast
to our little brother

35:07.209 --> 35:08.793
Sure, no problem

35:09.251 --> 35:09.876
Here

35:15.751 --> 35:16.834
A toast to him?

35:17.793 --> 35:19.584
A lesson from me!

35:19.918 --> 35:23.459
What's wrong?
I thought you were a good fighter

35:23.626 --> 35:25.168
The so-called Shadowless Fist!

35:25.793 --> 35:28.126
Why not show us?

35:29.793 --> 35:33.168
Shadowless Fist is impossible to discern

35:37.834 --> 35:39.626
I dare not disrespect big brother

35:44.459 --> 35:46.293
Big brother?

35:47.334 --> 35:50.959
He's just older, and will die sooner

35:52.668 --> 35:53.251
Come on!

35:59.565 --> 36:02.125
You sent someone to kill my men
at the gambling parlor last month

36:02.126 --> 36:03.168
Don't think I don't know it's you!

36:03.459 --> 36:06.168
They serve to die!

36:06.918 --> 36:07.584
So what?

36:07.626 --> 36:08.668
Who wants to fight?

36:08.709 --> 36:10.334
Master

36:12.501 --> 36:15.668
You want to fight?
Then get rid of the all North Sea Gang!

36:28.668 --> 36:30.584
Here's the porridge

36:47.543 --> 36:50.209
I have 2 fish here!

37:00.751 --> 37:01.626
Give me your hand

37:01.876 --> 37:02.543
Why?

37:10.251 --> 37:11.372
I bought it some time ago...

37:11.793 --> 37:13.751
trying to find the right moment
to give it to you

37:14.126 --> 37:16.793
But I don't know when's a good time

37:17.793 --> 37:19.126
When I bought it

37:19.751 --> 37:20.709
the shopkeeper asked

37:21.126 --> 37:22.766
if I was getting it for my future wife...

37:29.168 --> 37:30.208
I've to check the porridge

37:32.876 --> 37:34.583
Should I play a tune?

37:34.584 --> 37:35.751
Yes

38:13.626 --> 38:15.626
I've found a great job recently

38:16.126 --> 38:18.626
The foreigners refuse opium addicts
as overseas laborers

38:19.126 --> 38:22.626
So I stand in to give my thumb print
and do the medical check

38:22.793 --> 38:25.709
Once I pass the test, they will put
the addicts back and ship them out

38:27.209 --> 38:27.918
Look at this

38:28.584 --> 38:30.501
I got a silver ingot just by doing that!

38:31.209 --> 38:33.668
I can recommend you guys. Want to go?

38:33.876 --> 38:34.501
Want to go?

38:34.543 --> 38:35.668
Go! Go!

38:36.168 --> 38:37.709
Go! Go!

38:39.251 --> 38:41.168
Go! Go!

38:59.168 --> 39:01.543
They say you're the most powerful man
in Guangzhou

39:01.709 --> 39:02.709
What do you mean?

39:02.876 --> 39:07.126
We need 300 strong Chinese laborers
next month

39:07.168 --> 39:09.751
So far you've only sent me 130.
How come?

39:10.668 --> 39:12.668
You think getting 130 is easy?

39:13.834 --> 39:16.459
They must've forgotten about that
boat incident two months ago!

39:16.584 --> 39:18.793
400 workers were burnt to death!

39:19.209 --> 39:21.793
Now the whole town knows about this scandal

39:22.751 --> 39:25.459
Who dares to sign up to work overseas now?

39:25.751 --> 39:30.626
These 300 workers,
it'll take time even if I kidnap them

39:31.543 --> 39:34.543
We don't necessarily have to
give you this business

39:35.459 --> 39:40.626
If you can't deliver,
there are many others who will

39:40.793 --> 39:45.751
I'll give you what you want
in half of a month

39:50.209 --> 39:52.209
They asked me to kidnap 300 strong workers

39:53.251 --> 39:56.251
Just for the business of five lousy ships!

39:56.668 --> 39:58.876
The foreigners are indeed ravenous

39:58.959 --> 40:03.167
There are signing up to work overseas,
there's no need to use the pier workers

40:03.168 --> 40:04.668
Seems like my son...

40:05.543 --> 40:06.709
has a kind heart

40:07.251 --> 40:08.168
It's not kindness

40:09.168 --> 40:09.959
But righteousness

40:10.501 --> 40:12.751
Let me tell you what righteousness is

40:13.584 --> 40:15.584
To be good to those who treat you well

40:16.543 --> 40:17.543
This is righteousness

40:17.834 --> 40:20.918
Neither you nor I are
in a position to speak of it

40:21.293 --> 40:24.668
We have to play with the morals of our time

40:25.543 --> 40:30.501
I believe a real hero will lead the way,
not follow as expected

40:30.918 --> 40:33.668
I said the same naive things
when I was young

40:34.209 --> 40:36.751
To own a turf, one has to be ruthless

40:37.501 --> 40:41.834
You'll understand in time,
humans are no difference from ants

40:42.293 --> 40:44.709
Have you located the old man's son?

40:44.876 --> 40:45.876
He's hidden himself well

40:46.543 --> 40:49.709
From now on,
send less bodyguard to protect me

40:50.584 --> 40:52.334
I'm sure it'll lure him out

40:53.959 --> 40:54.501
Yes

40:59.293 --> 41:01.626
We have steamed buns for all,
come have some

41:04.626 --> 41:05.876
Get up and have a steamed bun!

41:09.709 --> 41:10.668
Wake up!

42:01.209 --> 42:06.793
A customer has asked me
to narrate two new stories

42:07.501 --> 42:12.876
The stories of Liu Bang Slaying the Snake
and Wu Song Beating the Tiger

42:13.501 --> 42:20.668
How did Liu finally defeat the Chu warlord
and unified the country

42:20.876 --> 42:22.251
Most importantly...

42:22.668 --> 42:26.876
Fiery, we may not survive the vengeance

42:27.668 --> 42:30.168
Let's be brothers again in the next life!

42:30.709 --> 42:31.751
Ah!

42:37.209 --> 42:38.543
How can I take my revenge now?

42:40.209 --> 42:43.833
Villain Li! Get up! I want my revenge!

42:43.834 --> 42:45.543
You two come with me!

42:48.251 --> 42:51.751
No, these villains were killed
by another gang of villains

42:52.584 --> 42:54.542
I want my revenge!
I don't want to go with you

42:54.543 --> 42:55.168
I want my revenge!

42:55.209 --> 42:56.876
Come with me!

43:04.793 --> 43:08.084
Ah!

43:08.126 --> 43:10.543
You want to leave? There are two options

43:10.584 --> 43:12.751
Either you answer my question correctly

43:12.918 --> 43:17.251
or learn martial arts
well enough to defeat me

43:17.543 --> 43:19.168
What question?

43:19.584 --> 43:22.625
What is vengeance?

43:22.626 --> 43:24.918
To punish the enemies!

43:25.209 --> 43:25.709
Wrong!

43:33.626 --> 43:35.293
What is vengeance?

43:35.751 --> 43:39.167
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

43:39.168 --> 43:39.793
Wrong!

43:40.626 --> 43:45.168
To get rid of fear, you must forge ahead
into the darkest corner!

43:46.876 --> 43:48.168
What is vengeance?

43:48.668 --> 43:50.667
To be more vicious
than the most ferocious person

43:50.668 --> 43:52.668
Seek out all villains
and take revenge on them

43:52.834 --> 43:53.626
Wrong!

43:53.959 --> 43:55.918
No matter how we answer, it's always wrong!

43:56.168 --> 43:58.543
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! All Wrong

43:58.834 --> 44:00.126
What are we wrong about?

44:00.209 --> 44:01.626
' I

44:02.459 --> 44:05.459
You are wrong to mention "I"

44:07.168 --> 44:11.209
Look into the fire, what do you see?

44:11.793 --> 44:12.918
I see hell!

44:13.501 --> 44:14.209
I see rage!

44:14.543 --> 44:16.168
What I see...

44:16.959 --> 44:19.834
is graciousness and sacrifice!

44:20.834 --> 44:24.793
Your father sacrificed
for the sake of saving others

44:25.793 --> 44:28.293
It's easy to kill but hard to save

44:28.668 --> 44:33.584
Your father told me once

44:33.834 --> 44:37.668
I teach you martial arts
so as to save people!

44:38.168 --> 44:40.959
Remember, no matter how tough things are

44:41.209 --> 44:42.834
Never give up saving another life!

44:45.918 --> 44:46.876
True vengeance...

44:48.709 --> 44:49.876
is to save lives!

44:52.876 --> 44:54.751
To save people from the flames of hell!

44:55.334 --> 44:57.626
You two can leave whenever you want

45:15.459 --> 45:16.668
Clothes mending!

45:17.709 --> 45:18.834
Need to mend anything?

45:25.876 --> 45:28.708
Miss, are you skillful?

45:28.709 --> 45:31.543
I'm very skillful with the collar

45:35.959 --> 45:36.834
Thank you, Miss!

45:39.543 --> 45:40.543
Go ahead

46:04.876 --> 46:05.751
Old Snake...

46:07.709 --> 46:08.876
has the gold key

46:18.209 --> 46:19.584
Old Snake is here

46:20.584 --> 46:21.793
Go away, get out of here!

46:26.501 --> 46:28.626
Go away, get out of here!

47:00.251 --> 47:03.459
Go away, get out of here!

47:06.459 --> 47:06.959
After him!

47:10.668 --> 47:11.459
Stop there!

47:14.209 --> 47:14.751
You there!

47:15.459 --> 47:16.918
You there!

47:17.626 --> 47:19.209
You there!

47:19.501 --> 47:19.668
After her!

47:19.669 --> 47:20.251
You there!

47:20.709 --> 47:21.458
You there!

47:21.459 --> 47:21.959
Be quick!

47:24.459 --> 47:24.959
You there!

47:26.209 --> 47:26.834
You there!

47:27.876 --> 47:29.168
You there!

47:58.209 --> 47:59.751
Pretty young girl like you?

48:00.709 --> 48:02.501
How dare you mess with me!

48:04.626 --> 48:06.709
Ah!

48:09.876 --> 48:12.126
Ah!

48:23.751 --> 48:25.209
Ah!

48:27.709 --> 48:28.834
Old Snake?

48:29.668 --> 48:34.167
You don't deserve to be a snake!
Not even a worm!

48:34.168 --> 48:35.126
Ah!

48:44.751 --> 48:45.876
Who are you?

48:50.918 --> 48:52.626
Ah!

49:10.459 --> 49:14.543
I'm me, we are the Orphan Gang

49:24.709 --> 49:25.626
Stinks!

49:26.459 --> 49:27.793
Who kicked him in there?

49:41.793 --> 49:43.584
This must be the gold key for the vault

49:49.251 --> 49:50.251
Put the key back!

49:53.668 --> 49:56.168
I heard it's a group,
called the Orphan Gang

49:59.584 --> 50:01.167
Stinks!

50:01.168 --> 50:02.834
Evil has its retribution?

50:03.626 --> 50:06.959
Whoever wrote this must be out of his mind!

50:12.668 --> 50:15.584
Master, luckily the key is not lost

50:17.668 --> 50:19.626
You'll keep the gold key

50:19.834 --> 50:23.876
From now on, you and Black Crow
will be responsible for the money vault

50:29.543 --> 50:30.293
Thank you! Father!

50:30.918 --> 50:32.543
Thank me?

50:33.584 --> 50:34.918
Am I giving you the money vault?

50:37.209 --> 50:40.251
No, I thank you for trusting me

50:40.793 --> 50:42.251
I don't deserve this honor

50:42.793 --> 50:43.876
Perhaps this key...

50:46.209 --> 50:51.293
should be kept by Fei or Black Crow

50:51.584 --> 50:52.784
I'm not good in keeping things

50:53.543 --> 50:55.959
I only know how to fight

50:56.793 --> 50:58.334
You don't want to control the vault?

50:58.709 --> 51:00.209
Maybe you'd rather control me?

51:03.751 --> 51:06.584
Those who aspire not for small profits
must cherish big ambition

51:07.168 --> 51:08.293
What is your big ambition?

51:10.626 --> 51:11.501
I only want...

51:13.626 --> 51:14.918
what you want

51:18.709 --> 51:19.751
You have nerves!

51:21.543 --> 51:23.168
Dare to smile when you should be scared

51:25.251 --> 51:25.918
Just like me!

51:44.543 --> 51:46.293
To catch a fish requires patience

51:47.626 --> 51:48.251
For you!

52:06.209 --> 52:07.626
Open it! Open it!

52:08.459 --> 52:09.793
Open it! Open it!

52:10.709 --> 52:11.959
Triple four!

52:12.459 --> 52:14.459
Pay up! Pay up!

52:15.668 --> 52:16.208
Great!

52:16.209 --> 52:16.792
What luck! Let's go!

52:16.793 --> 52:17.459
Great!

52:17.918 --> 52:19.750
Luck is on my side! Nothing can stop me

52:19.751 --> 52:20.918
All in!

52:21.751 --> 52:25.834
Three three one! Seven points. Small

52:26.876 --> 52:30.168
I want to borrow 50 silver ingots

52:30.543 --> 52:32.292
You are the new Forth Young Master

52:32.293 --> 52:35.543
No problem! Bring 50 ingots
to the new Forth Young Master!

52:36.668 --> 52:38.334
Place your bets! Place your bets!

52:40.584 --> 52:41.668
Triple 6

52:41.793 --> 52:43.501
Hey big bro!

52:43.834 --> 52:45.833
Five Five Six. Sixteen points. Big

52:45.834 --> 52:47.293
Darn, just off by a little!

52:47.334 --> 52:49.374
You must be having a problem
with the silver ingots!

52:51.334 --> 52:52.655
Lend me another 50 silver ingots!

52:56.793 --> 52:57.793
Brother, brother, no!

52:57.834 --> 52:58.584
All in!

52:59.709 --> 53:01.501
Triple One! Banker takes all!

53:01.584 --> 53:02.584
Another 50 silver ingots!

53:04.168 --> 53:06.834
Six Six Two. Fourteen points. Big

53:07.168 --> 53:08.168
Another 50 silver ingots!

53:09.918 --> 53:12.168
Three three one! Seven points. Small

53:12.209 --> 53:13.209
Another 50 silver ingots!

53:15.751 --> 53:16.793
Another 50 silver ingots!

53:17.543 --> 53:19.834
Forth Young Master, it's against the rule

53:20.543 --> 53:22.251
You're putting me in a difficult situation

53:23.751 --> 53:24.918
I want another 50!

53:25.251 --> 53:26.709
Hurry up and bring it out!

53:27.543 --> 53:28.293
Bring it out!

53:29.209 --> 53:30.168
What's all this fuss!

53:31.584 --> 53:32.918
I want 50 silver ingots!

53:35.501 --> 53:36.543
How dare you!

53:37.626 --> 53:42.209
Take this 50 ingots as a welcome gift

53:44.751 --> 53:45.543
Big brother

53:46.876 --> 53:48.584
I want 3000 silver ingots

53:49.918 --> 53:51.334
Are you kidding me?

53:51.543 --> 53:55.293
I mean, I want 3000 as a gift not a loan

53:55.918 --> 53:58.834
If you are looking for trouble,
you'd better stop it

53:59.543 --> 54:03.626
With these debts, I have reasons
to kill you. Father can't blame me

54:08.751 --> 54:10.501
How much do you think this's worth?

54:11.584 --> 54:12.876
How did you get this gold key?

54:13.251 --> 54:14.918
Of course from Old Snake

54:15.543 --> 54:17.876
Someone tried to make a mold
and I caught him red-handed

54:18.459 --> 54:18.959
Who?

54:19.751 --> 54:21.126
North Evil's minions

54:23.126 --> 54:26.209
North Evil?
He wants to swallow the money vault?

54:28.126 --> 54:30.251
So you're here to make a business deal

54:32.793 --> 54:35.834
You should give this to Father
but you brought it here instead

54:36.293 --> 54:39.626
This is betraying the gang

54:39.918 --> 54:43.959
It takes the gold and silver key
to open the money vault

54:44.293 --> 54:47.668
I neither have the silver key
nor know the whereabouts of the vault

54:47.793 --> 54:50.793
This key means nothing to me,
not at all a deadly crime

54:51.668 --> 54:54.876
Since it's useless here,
I'll give it back to Father

54:55.793 --> 54:58.959
Looks like you won't leave
without winning tonight

55:01.543 --> 55:03.168
It depends on you, the dealer

55:04.668 --> 55:08.793
Come to think of it,
3000 silver ingots is far too cheap

55:10.168 --> 55:15.168
To choose between you
or North Evil to benefit from this

55:15.834 --> 55:16.876
I'd rather it be you

55:17.876 --> 55:20.751
North Evil knows you have this?

55:20.834 --> 55:21.918
Of course not!

55:23.543 --> 55:25.501
I've already killed that minion

55:26.668 --> 55:31.501
He'd never imagine the gold key
is now with you

55:36.668 --> 55:39.793
Since North Evil has set his heart
on getting the money vault,

55:41.168 --> 55:43.168
then he might have killed Old Snake

55:43.959 --> 55:47.709
If that's the case,
you will be his next target!

55:49.501 --> 55:52.168
Perhaps you've already
been stabbed in the back

55:54.668 --> 55:56.543
I've to try this key first

55:57.209 --> 56:00.459
If there's anything wrong,
you won't get away with this

56:00.751 --> 56:03.458
Big Brother, you're playing it safe?

56:03.459 --> 56:05.219
Showing me the money
vault to get me involved

57:12.584 --> 57:14.418
Master Lei ask us to come

57:48.293 --> 57:49.584
Finally caught the big fish

57:53.334 --> 57:56.208
Forth Master, your fish!

57:56.209 --> 57:56.876
It's for you!

57:57.626 --> 57:58.459
Forth Master!

58:02.126 --> 58:03.376
Here's a peanut for you!

58:22.293 --> 58:23.209
It's a map!

58:38.501 --> 58:41.168
Miss, your dress has been mended

58:51.918 --> 58:54.918
Men are so impatient,
always tear off my collar

58:55.543 --> 58:57.334
Fortunately, you're a good seamstress

58:58.668 --> 59:01.876
My mending skills are good, have a look

59:14.334 --> 59:15.584
Tomorrow

59:40.334 --> 59:43.918
How come she doesn't turn
to look at you this time?

59:51.376 --> 59:53.876
You like Chun, why don't you tell her?

59:54.584 --> 59:56.126
If it'll hurt Fiery...

59:58.626 --> 01:00:00.209
I'd rather give up Chun

01:00:00.459 --> 01:00:01.918
But Chun likes you

01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:05.168
How do you know?

01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:10.959
When I told her my collar was torn by you

01:00:20.668 --> 01:00:26.543
Alright, next time
I'll tell her you just hide here

01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:28.959
UP to you

01:00:32.959 --> 01:00:34.959
Since you three are good friends,

01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:38.209
why can't you be frank about it?

01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:40.543
Let Chun choose whoever she likes

01:00:41.168 --> 01:00:45.168
Maybe three of you can
stay together forever

01:00:47.376 --> 01:00:48.751
You like to joke

01:00:49.626 --> 01:00:51.293
I envy her

01:00:54.543 --> 01:00:56.251
If I was her,

01:00:59.209 --> 01:01:00.168
I'd seize

01:01:01.668 --> 01:01:02.668
Not for the man

01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:05.334
But for the heart

01:01:22.584 --> 01:01:23.918
Master, this way!

01:01:32.918 --> 01:01:35.376
Master, this way!

01:01:36.376 --> 01:01:38.209
Master, this way!

01:01:55.959 --> 01:01:57.459
Where are the workman chiefs?

01:01:57.918 --> 01:01:59.209
Follow me!

01:02:20.918 --> 01:02:23.501
You are a collector of weapons

01:02:26.334 --> 01:02:27.334
They are not mine

01:02:27.418 --> 01:02:28.668
They belong to my enemies

01:02:29.501 --> 01:02:31.626
They're my most loyal friends

01:02:32.168 --> 01:02:33.334
Accompany me in every battle

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.168
They will never betray me

01:02:45.168 --> 01:02:50.168
Do you know what
I'm thinking of when seated?

01:02:52.626 --> 01:02:53.459
Your business?

01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:58.293
I'm thinking who else wants to kill me?

01:02:58.626 --> 01:02:59.959
No need to be paranoid!

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:03.293
The entire Guangzhou Pier is your turf now

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:09.501
Old Snake's death tells me...

01:03:10.168 --> 01:03:11.626
Someone's conspiring against me

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:42.543
Know why I bring you here today
and you alone?

01:03:43.418 --> 01:03:47.501
I want you to feel the joy
of uprooting a problem

01:03:49.168 --> 01:03:49.668
Lei!

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:56.251
If my father didn't help you
build this turf at the pier,

01:03:56.543 --> 01:03:58.459
you wouldn't have anything today

01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:02.543
And you

01:04:05.543 --> 01:04:07.126
No need to lure me out

01:04:09.418 --> 01:04:11.293
I will definitely come for you

01:06:20.418 --> 01:06:21.209
Can you manage?

01:06:21.418 --> 01:06:22.418
Yes I can!

01:06:23.251 --> 01:06:24.501
He can't

01:06:24.876 --> 01:06:26.876
No you can't

01:07:48.918 --> 01:07:49.418
Father!

01:07:49.459 --> 01:07:49.959
Careful!

01:08:11.793 --> 01:08:13.584
Do it!

01:08:19.084 --> 01:08:20.167
I don't want to kill you

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:24.626
If you're not dead,

01:08:26.334 --> 01:08:29.126
what's there to live for?

01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:57.292
Don't hesitate, show no mercy!

01:09:00.209 --> 01:09:03.542
I didn't kill him, you did

01:09:26.459 --> 01:09:28.584
Everyone! Get out!

01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:29.917
You get out!

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:33.459
Get up!

01:09:36.334 --> 01:09:37.501
Everyone! Get up!

01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:38.792
Get out!

01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:41.792
Get up!

01:09:42.626 --> 01:09:44.667
Help! Help!

01:10:45.668 --> 01:10:46.376
Stay there!

01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:48.668
Be quick! Round him up from the front!

01:10:49.258 --> 01:10:50.059
That's the arsonist!

01:10:50.084 --> 01:10:50.604
Round him up!

01:10:50.934 --> 01:10:51.434
Stay there!

01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:52.501
Be quick! Round him up!

01:10:53.293 --> 01:10:53.959
Don't run!

01:10:57.584 --> 01:10:58.209
Stay there!

01:11:14.918 --> 01:11:15.668
Good-for-nothing!

01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:16.668
Get him!

01:11:17.168 --> 01:11:18.501
Stay there! Get him!

01:11:26.459 --> 01:11:28.168
Get him! Stay there!

01:11:35.501 --> 01:11:36.168
Over there!

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:36.918
And here!

01:12:03.334 --> 01:12:06.209
Master, the opium dens are on fire!

01:12:10.418 --> 01:12:12.293
Father, I'll go check!

01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:17.501
Stay there!

01:12:31.168 --> 01:12:31.668
That Way!

01:13:30.251 --> 01:13:31.011
Brother Black Crow!

01:13:37.584 --> 01:13:38.543
Brother Fei

01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:40.709
Where's the girl?

01:13:55.251 --> 01:13:57.418
It's a trap! You're with them!

01:13:59.293 --> 01:14:01.126
You're not stupid, just greedy

01:14:01.293 --> 01:14:04.126
Do you remember my parents?

01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:08.959
Ma Yin Shun and Tsui Lai Leung
from the Guang Yuen Escort Service?

01:14:09.626 --> 01:14:12.125
They were just ordinary armed escorts

01:14:12.126 --> 01:14:15.543
They refused to join your gang
and you killed them

01:14:16.626 --> 01:14:22.959
I, Ma Chun Yuk,
swear to avenge their death today!

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:27.459
Giving me the gold key was your first step

01:14:28.168 --> 01:14:30.668
To get my silver key is the second

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.128
And there's the third...

01:15:34.293 --> 01:15:35.013
Four years already

01:15:37.168 --> 01:15:41.709
We've never
been able to say a word to one another

01:15:43.584 --> 01:15:46.334
I can see you
when I pass by the courtesan boat

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:50.959
I can only see you off
when you walk over the bridge

01:15:52.168 --> 01:15:53.251
No one would notice

01:15:54.459 --> 01:15:55.251
Last time...

01:15:57.668 --> 01:15:59.209
Why didn't you look at me?

01:15:59.668 --> 01:16:01.108
I don't want to see you two together

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.209
It's my fault

01:16:06.626 --> 01:16:08.546
But you've been
tearing off her collar frequently

01:16:09.126 --> 01:16:10.526
Takes me a lot of effort to mend it

01:16:18.168 --> 01:16:19.126
A gift from Fiery

01:16:25.293 --> 01:16:29.168
I'll tell him about us when it's over

01:16:31.418 --> 01:16:32.918
I've been waiting for you to say this

01:16:34.543 --> 01:16:35.418
Trust me

01:16:36.126 --> 01:16:37.126
One more move

01:16:38.668 --> 01:16:39.626
We're almost there

01:16:41.459 --> 01:16:43.626
Promise me to stay alive!

01:17:23.376 --> 01:17:24.626
He refuses to talk

01:17:25.126 --> 01:17:25.626
Come

01:17:26.334 --> 01:17:27.168
Beat him up!

01:17:27.959 --> 01:17:29.501
Make him tell us his accomplices!

01:17:29.959 --> 01:17:30.679
No need to do that

01:17:32.501 --> 01:17:36.418
My brothers are very busy now

01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:43.626
The money vault!

01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.770
You stay here!

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:05.833
There's money to be distributed
at TongRen Lane!

01:18:05.834 --> 01:18:08.376
Money will be distributed
to the poor for free!

01:18:26.543 --> 01:18:27.543
Master

01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:31.208
While we went to put out the fire
at the opium dens,

01:18:31.209 --> 01:18:33.876
the poor raided the money vault

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.209
Where're the guards?

01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:38.584
They're all killed

01:18:43.126 --> 01:18:45.208
Fetch Black Crow and North Evil now!

01:18:45.209 --> 01:18:46.500
You'll be alright

01:18:46.501 --> 01:18:47.208
Listen

01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.709
I'm here

01:18:48.376 --> 01:18:49.501
Let's kill our way out!

01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:50.709
I won't leave!

01:18:54.668 --> 01:18:56.209
Tell Chun

01:18:57.459 --> 01:18:58.584
I love her very much

01:19:00.084 --> 01:19:01.876
You tell her that yourself

01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:03.709
Let's go

01:19:04.418 --> 01:19:06.084
I've no chance

01:19:06.543 --> 01:19:08.626
I've always want to
snatch her away from you

01:19:09.918 --> 01:19:11.584
but now I'd better give her back to you

01:19:12.084 --> 01:19:13.165
I don't want you to do that

01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:15.418
Let's fight our way out!

01:19:19.584 --> 01:19:20.501
What's wrong with you!

01:19:20.918 --> 01:19:22.084
Listen!

01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:29.293
You can't give up our dream
for the sake of saving me

01:19:29.876 --> 01:19:32.668
Burn down the opium dens,
open the money vault, right?

01:19:34.209 --> 01:19:38.459
If my sacrifice can help you save
the 300 innocent workers

01:19:39.334 --> 01:19:40.774
There're plenty of fathers out there

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:44.251
Save them so that their kids
won't turn into orphans like me

01:19:45.376 --> 01:19:47.501
This is what we've been striving to do,
isn't it?

01:19:48.293 --> 01:19:50.501
I can't watch you die and do nothing

01:19:52.376 --> 01:19:53.459
I can't do it!

01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:57.876
Don't forget our oath on the mountain

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.533
Don't make me die with regrets!

01:19:59.876 --> 01:20:01.168
How can I forget?

01:20:02.376 --> 01:20:03.459
I didn't forget!

01:20:04.459 --> 01:20:07.126
But don't make me live in guilt
for the rest of my life

01:20:07.268 --> 01:20:08.268
Without you, our dream...

01:20:08.293 --> 01:20:10.418
You picked the hell divination stick

01:20:12.668 --> 01:20:13.418
Stay on

01:20:15.501 --> 01:20:17.251
Fulfill our dreams

01:20:19.334 --> 01:20:21.334
You once said...

01:20:22.668 --> 01:20:25.209
my life is your life, remember?

01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:28.334
Today I'll repay you

01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:30.501
From now on

01:20:31.334 --> 01:20:34.001
My dream is your dream!

01:20:35.668 --> 01:20:39.709
Since we share one life,
I won't have any regrets

01:20:43.334 --> 01:20:46.709
Pity I can't treat you any more peanuts

01:21:22.668 --> 01:21:23.376
Get lost!

01:21:24.459 --> 01:21:26.168
I won't say a word!

01:21:43.543 --> 01:21:46.418
You know how many people died
of those silver ingots?

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:48.334
What're you people doing?

01:21:50.001 --> 01:21:51.334
It's for our dream!

01:21:52.584 --> 01:21:55.418
To make a man like you fall!

01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:59.209
There must be a mole in my gang

01:21:59.709 --> 01:22:01.668
Otherwise you won't be able to
open the vault

01:22:04.418 --> 01:22:05.668
Bring me scissors!

01:22:07.626 --> 01:22:10.459
Kill me! Go ahead!

01:22:10.501 --> 01:22:11.251
Fei

01:22:13.251 --> 01:22:14.251
Cut his tongue off!

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:46.168
Why must you take it this far?

01:22:47.668 --> 01:22:49.583
Why must you take it this far!

01:22:49.584 --> 01:22:50.334
Do it!

01:22:51.626 --> 01:22:52.459
Kill me!

01:22:53.334 --> 01:22:53.834
Cut!

01:22:56.918 --> 01:22:57.543
Master!

01:22:58.709 --> 01:23:01.168
Master! Black Crow has been killed

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.918
Check the silver key on him!

01:23:44.334 --> 01:23:45.001
Ahhh

01:23:46.334 --> 01:23:46.834
Hmmm

01:24:15.168 --> 01:24:15.668
Father

01:24:17.168 --> 01:24:17.768
There's no key!

01:24:19.251 --> 01:24:23.334
But strange to find on Black Crow's body...

01:24:24.376 --> 01:24:28.251
a wound too similar...

01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:33.334
What're you implying?

01:24:39.293 --> 01:24:44.584
Father, Black Crow and I had our
differences but I can't possibly kill him

01:24:45.584 --> 01:24:47.709
We didn't even have a chance to fight

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.501
I've been framed

01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:52.334
This is a setup!

01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:04.458
This person killed my two sons
and opened my money vault

01:25:04.459 --> 01:25:09.458
He must have wanted
to wipe out the Black Tiger Gang

01:25:09.459 --> 01:25:13.251
So that he could reap
benefit and replace me

01:25:14.251 --> 01:25:14.751
Father

01:25:15.459 --> 01:25:18.209
I've been in the gang for 13 years

01:25:18.501 --> 01:25:21.168
I've never done anything wrong

01:25:21.334 --> 01:25:22.626
I didn't say it's you!

01:25:25.126 --> 01:25:27.334
Father, please wait a second

01:25:48.168 --> 01:25:50.668
Tell me who killed Black Crow

01:25:52.209 --> 01:25:55.668
Which among us is your guy?

01:26:03.334 --> 01:26:08.543
If you refuse to speak,
I'll make you beg for mercy

01:26:10.143 --> 01:26:10.643
Speak!

01:26:10.668 --> 01:26:11.293
I'll say!

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:12.834
I'll say!

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:14.834
That's more like it

01:26:17.918 --> 01:26:18.668
What?

01:26:19.334 --> 01:26:20.501
Louder!

01:26:25.834 --> 01:26:26.418
Tell me!

01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:36.376
Say it properly!

01:26:42.626 --> 01:26:45.251
I've made an oath
with my brother by striking fist

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:47.876
Don't cry for me!

01:26:57.209 --> 01:26:57.709
Father

01:26:58.376 --> 01:27:00.459
I didn't kill him

01:27:01.209 --> 01:27:02.418
What did he say to you?

01:27:03.293 --> 01:27:05.251
He set me up!

01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:07.126
He sacrificed his life to set you up?

01:27:09.251 --> 01:27:10.626
How unfair it's to you!

01:27:13.501 --> 01:27:15.501
Challenge me?

01:27:16.293 --> 01:27:17.584
That's what I love!

01:27:17.626 --> 01:27:18.918
Hang him on the arch

01:27:24.209 --> 01:27:25.251
Come on Brother, let's go!

01:27:26.459 --> 01:27:30.126
The only way to save people from hell is
by venturing into it

01:27:30.334 --> 01:27:30.876
Brother

01:27:31.334 --> 01:27:33.376
One of us has to step into this hell

01:27:33.418 --> 01:27:34.858
in order to rip them from the inside

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:36.543
Draw one!

01:27:37.918 --> 01:27:39.558
The long one is the hell divination stick

01:27:47.584 --> 01:27:49.785
I'm so afraid you might snatch
the hell divination stick

01:27:50.418 --> 01:27:51.501
If I die...

01:27:52.376 --> 01:27:53.709
promise you won't avenge my death

01:27:53.959 --> 01:27:57.418
The one left behind
must accomplish our dream

01:28:02.126 --> 01:28:03.209
This is...

01:28:03.626 --> 01:28:06.293
our promise!

01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:22.584
Even if we get rid of a gang,
another gang will take over

01:28:23.293 --> 01:28:24.293
It's never-ending

01:28:25.126 --> 01:28:26.126
In five years

01:28:27.459 --> 01:28:31.293
I'll be the most feared person here
and conquer all the bad guys

01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:36.251
I'll unite all orphans and work
with you to take them down

01:29:19.459 --> 01:29:20.626
Why am I here?

01:29:26.543 --> 01:29:29.209
Last night you came back
and said Fiery has died

01:29:31.293 --> 01:29:32.418
Fiery died

01:29:33.626 --> 01:29:35.209
And you passed out

01:29:37.876 --> 01:29:39.293
You even cried in your dream

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:44.209
He was my best buddy

01:29:47.668 --> 01:29:51.668
He died in front of me
and I couldn't save him

01:29:56.293 --> 01:29:58.584
I no longer know what
we've been doing is worthwhile

01:30:02.334 --> 01:30:04.543
You guys have done something
we never dare to do

01:30:06.418 --> 01:30:07.251
Do you know...

01:30:08.334 --> 01:30:12.251
When the poor got the silver ingots,
they were overjoyed with tears

01:30:14.334 --> 01:30:15.959
Everyone was happy

01:30:17.626 --> 01:30:19.668
watching the opium dens burn...

01:30:20.918 --> 01:30:22.584
Gave them a glimmer of hope

01:30:24.918 --> 01:30:27.668
You always encourage them
to stand up and fight, didn't you?

01:30:29.168 --> 01:30:30.459
Fiery is dead

01:30:31.668 --> 01:30:32.918
Fiery is gone

01:30:36.334 --> 01:30:37.584
Fiery is gone

01:30:41.584 --> 01:30:42.668
Fiery is gone

01:30:46.459 --> 01:30:48.219
I'll never be able to
walk out from this hell

01:30:56.459 --> 01:30:57.251
Look at me

01:31:00.168 --> 01:31:02.918
But a lot of people can because of you

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:05.626
It's useless

01:31:05.876 --> 01:31:07.126
Up till now

01:31:07.626 --> 01:31:09.459
I still can't figure out

01:31:09.584 --> 01:31:12.293
where they hide the 300 missing workers

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:13.959
300!!

01:31:19.334 --> 01:31:20.668
It is North Evil's business

01:31:21.168 --> 01:31:22.501
Lei didn't let me get involved

01:31:24.251 --> 01:31:25.334
North Evil

01:31:26.168 --> 01:31:27.501
is starting to suspect me

01:31:32.668 --> 01:31:33.668
I have to move fast

01:31:37.168 --> 01:31:38.668
To quickly rescue them

01:31:41.626 --> 01:31:43.346
Why not find a chance to kill Lei directly?

01:31:43.668 --> 01:31:44.376
No

01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:46.168
If we do...

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.668
North Evil would
become the new master of the gang

01:31:49.501 --> 01:31:52.668
The pier will still be held by villains,
just a different leader

01:31:57.168 --> 01:31:58.668
You've to deal with two villains

01:32:09.876 --> 01:32:14.209
I wish I could help you just like Chun does

01:32:15.293 --> 01:32:16.773
Forth Master, someone is here for you

01:32:56.626 --> 01:32:57.418
Fiery!

01:33:12.376 --> 01:33:15.501
This person was a brilliant man

01:33:16.584 --> 01:33:19.376
His name was Zhuge Liang

01:33:19.751 --> 01:33:22.918
Also known as Kong Ming,
nicknamed 'Sleeping Dragon'

01:33:23.626 --> 01:33:27.584
He's knowledgeable
in astronomy and geography...

01:33:27.751 --> 01:33:29.459
Well respected by all

01:33:29.626 --> 01:33:31.918
Understands Yin and Yang
and the Eight Trigrams...

01:33:33.334 --> 01:33:36.500
I want to hear the historical stories
of "Ambush on All Sides"

01:33:36.501 --> 01:33:38.261
And "Invitation to Step
into the Heated Jar"

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:45.584
Father! Master!

01:33:47.751 --> 01:33:49.459
Why are you so late?

01:33:49.918 --> 01:33:50.668
Brother

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:51.999
Where were you last night?

01:33:52.543 --> 01:33:54.459
I found Young Master at the courtesan boat

01:33:55.418 --> 01:33:56.018
Courtesan boat?

01:33:56.959 --> 01:33:58.626
How can you have the mood?

01:33:59.751 --> 01:34:01.459
A great show is about to begin

01:34:05.834 --> 01:34:07.959
We've got here surrounded

01:34:08.793 --> 01:34:10.501
If they make a move,

01:34:11.834 --> 01:34:13.708
we'll wipe them out

01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:16.501
lining up as Kongming has directed them

01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:20.375
As the auspicious hour arrived

01:34:20.376 --> 01:34:22.500
Kongming fasted and bathed

01:34:22.501 --> 01:34:26.668
Put on a Taoist robe
and came before the altar

01:34:28.918 --> 01:34:31.459
What'd happen then?

01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:37.793
Now, the story of the fight between Chor
and Han in the Warring Period

01:34:37.959 --> 01:34:42.334
Ambush on All Sides and
"Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar"

01:34:42.876 --> 01:34:44.918
Why not the Story of Three Kingdoms?

01:34:56.793 --> 01:34:58.376
Who dares to tip them?

01:35:08.501 --> 01:35:09.543
The mole is here!

01:35:09.918 --> 01:35:11.543
No one is allowed to leave

01:35:12.418 --> 01:35:14.876
I've been here all morning
and hadn't stepped away

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.816
Definitely has nothing to do with me

01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:20.876
No one says it's you,
don't try to blame it on others

01:35:23.293 --> 01:35:24.834
Bring me the Storyteller!

01:35:25.459 --> 01:35:27.918
May I ask who this master is?

01:35:36.626 --> 01:35:42.626
Tell me, who asked you
to tell these two stories?

01:35:42.918 --> 01:35:43.793
Yes

01:35:44.501 --> 01:35:49.334
Indeed a man paid me earlier
to ask me to tell these stories

01:35:49.418 --> 01:35:53.501
But I'm blind and cannot tell how he looks

01:35:54.376 --> 01:35:56.543
How about his voice? Can you recognize it?

01:35:56.876 --> 01:36:00.376
The blind has the best ears

01:36:04.376 --> 01:36:07.751
Each of you come up
and say the words into his ear

01:36:08.418 --> 01:36:10.918
Ambush on All Sides,
Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar

01:36:11.876 --> 01:36:12.750
Including you two!

01:36:12.751 --> 01:36:15.071
Ambush on All Sides,
Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar

01:36:16.626 --> 01:36:18.946
Ambush on All Sides,
Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar

01:36:21.751 --> 01:36:24.071
Ambush on All Sides,
Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar

01:36:29.626 --> 01:36:32.584
Ambush on All Sides,
Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar

01:36:35.626 --> 01:36:38.584
Ambush on All Sides,
Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar

01:37:10.293 --> 01:37:12.459
We opened the money vault
and burnt the opium dens

01:37:18.459 --> 01:37:20.334
Through which door did you two come in?

01:37:21.876 --> 01:37:24.793
Because we're late,
we came in through the backdoor

01:37:26.293 --> 01:37:28.459
Without crossing the market?

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:29.668
No!

01:37:41.501 --> 01:37:42.221
Forth Young Master

01:37:43.584 --> 01:37:46.834
Master has to deliver some cargoes
to the leprosarium for the foreigners

01:37:47.376 --> 01:37:50.168
Your service is required this time

01:37:50.543 --> 01:37:51.043
Sure

01:37:58.793 --> 01:38:01.418
Master will personally deliver?
What cargoes?

01:38:01.834 --> 01:38:03.251
Medicines for the leprosarium

01:38:03.543 --> 01:38:08.501
North Evil used to be responsible
but this time Master has to do it

01:38:09.459 --> 01:38:10.251
Then...

01:38:10.543 --> 01:38:11.834
Please ask no more

01:38:31.418 --> 01:38:31.918
How is it?

01:38:32.334 --> 01:38:34.584
I've ordered all customers
to leave the bathhouse

01:38:36.918 --> 01:38:38.459
You guys stand guard

01:38:39.918 --> 01:38:43.376
Don't even let a fly get in

01:39:03.668 --> 01:39:05.501
Why does a courtesan boat girl come here?

01:39:06.626 --> 01:39:07.918
I come to see Master North Evil

01:39:09.793 --> 01:39:11.513
I am Orchid from the Capital Courtesan Boat

01:39:12.418 --> 01:39:15.293
I have a secret
about the money vault to tell him

01:39:18.459 --> 01:39:20.339
A Capital Courtesan Boat girl
is here to see you

01:39:23.459 --> 01:39:27.209
Capital Courtesan Boat?
The one Fei frequents

01:39:39.668 --> 01:39:43.834
You're Fei's woman,
what do you want from me?

01:39:44.834 --> 01:39:46.876
I won't believe a word you say

01:39:47.668 --> 01:39:49.543
My words will make him die

01:39:49.668 --> 01:39:50.793
Would you believe me?

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:52.626
You are a mere woman

01:39:53.668 --> 01:39:54.793
With no family

01:39:59.376 --> 01:40:01.584
Why betray him?

01:40:03.501 --> 01:40:05.918
Sooner or later he will be exposed

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:11.334
I'd better find a more stable sugar daddy

01:40:16.376 --> 01:40:21.001
I heard he only goes to your boat

01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:23.584
He must treat you very well

01:40:24.543 --> 01:40:25.834
We knew each other since young

01:40:26.751 --> 01:40:28.376
My nickname was Little Fa

01:40:29.793 --> 01:40:31.709
He and I used to be very close

01:40:32.668 --> 01:40:34.584
But later we were separated

01:40:35.543 --> 01:40:38.876
We met again three years ago
at the courtesan boat

01:40:40.418 --> 01:40:41.543
I saved him once

01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:44.376
So he trusts me

01:40:45.668 --> 01:40:48.376
That's why I know his background and secret

01:40:51.626 --> 01:40:53.001
Don't play tricks with me

01:40:55.668 --> 01:40:57.793
What secret do you know?

01:40:59.834 --> 01:41:03.334
He killed Black Crow! How's that?

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:06.668
I knew it was him!

01:41:07.668 --> 01:41:09.584
It was his idea to open the money vault

01:41:10.668 --> 01:41:14.584
He stays in the gang in order
to find the missing 300 workers

01:41:14.751 --> 01:41:16.376
I love him very much

01:41:17.876 --> 01:41:19.709
And plan to stay with him forever

01:41:22.668 --> 01:41:24.501
But later I discovered

01:41:25.376 --> 01:41:28.626
I'm not the one he loves

01:41:29.668 --> 01:41:31.584
My heart is broken

01:41:34.834 --> 01:41:37.459
I must think of a way to protect myself

01:42:02.376 --> 01:42:03.418
Tell me

01:42:05.376 --> 01:42:07.418
What kind of reward do you want?

01:42:08.626 --> 01:42:09.834
Master North Evil

01:42:11.543 --> 01:42:13.376
I want you

01:42:20.793 --> 01:42:23.918
I only have this feeble body
that's unable to walk steadily

01:42:27.959 --> 01:42:30.834
Without a big rock like you,
I won't be able to survive

01:42:34.668 --> 01:42:36.334
Will you take me in?

01:42:44.668 --> 01:42:46.029
We're here to deliver the medicine

01:43:07.876 --> 01:43:08.543
Shut up!

01:43:11.668 --> 01:43:12.334
Shut up!

01:43:18.501 --> 01:43:19.793
Shut up! Shut up!

01:43:21.209 --> 01:43:22.876
I say shut up!

01:43:23.001 --> 01:43:23.834
Get Back!

01:43:33.334 --> 01:43:34.168
Come on!

01:44:12.418 --> 01:44:12.938
Let go of me!

01:44:13.626 --> 01:44:14.459
Let go of me!

01:44:14.668 --> 01:44:15.668
Let go of me!

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:18.834
You want to kill me?

01:44:20.293 --> 01:44:21.876
Kill you!

01:44:26.543 --> 01:44:27.668
You want to kill me?

01:44:29.334 --> 01:44:31.334
It isn't easy to kill someone

01:44:35.668 --> 01:44:39.584
You know why I am still alive today?

01:44:40.376 --> 01:44:43.418
I have eyes all over my body

01:45:20.834 --> 01:45:23.668
We'll deliver them to the boat
on the 15th of next month

01:45:38.751 --> 01:45:39.918
A feeble woman like that

01:45:42.501 --> 01:45:43.668
Wants to kill me?

01:45:47.668 --> 01:45:49.459
This little brother is really naive

01:45:53.459 --> 01:45:59.751
To incur a double loss

01:46:07.876 --> 01:46:08.793
Nowhere to hide

01:46:09.918 --> 01:46:11.793
You can't go through that wall!

01:46:21.459 --> 01:46:24.501
This is for the people you have killed!

01:46:39.418 --> 01:46:41.584
How can I let you sacrifice yourself?

01:46:41.834 --> 01:46:44.417
Why get involved in this?

01:46:44.418 --> 01:46:48.459
I am a prostitute, this is the only way
to get close to North Evil

01:46:49.459 --> 01:46:52.418
If I can use my body to kill this monster,

01:46:52.834 --> 01:46:54.501
it's a redemption

01:46:55.584 --> 01:46:56.418
Besides...

01:46:57.668 --> 01:47:01.584
Only by doing so,
I can have Fei's heart forever

01:47:03.876 --> 01:47:06.626
I always envy you, even jealous

01:47:07.876 --> 01:47:10.418
You can do what you think is right

01:47:11.584 --> 01:47:15.418
But I'm left with no choice all my life

01:47:17.418 --> 01:47:18.293
Promise me

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.822
No matter how grave the situation

01:47:23.668 --> 01:47:25.293
Don't come near me

01:47:26.626 --> 01:47:28.543
I cannot bear to see you in danger

01:47:32.293 --> 01:47:35.459
North Evil is very cunning

01:47:36.626 --> 01:47:39.376
If I don't succeed, you still can

01:47:40.293 --> 01:47:43.584
As long as we achieve our goal,
it doesn't matter who sacrifices

01:48:01.501 --> 01:48:03.334
She is Little Fa

01:48:05.918 --> 01:48:07.709
Why tell me in such a way?

01:48:13.293 --> 01:48:15.293
Why do you tell me in such a way?

01:48:18.501 --> 01:48:19.334
I know why...

01:48:24.418 --> 01:48:26.626
She wants to be in your heart forever

01:48:33.459 --> 01:48:36.626
We still have to accomplish
what we got to do

01:48:43.334 --> 01:48:46.334
We now know where
the kidnapped workers are kept

01:48:49.668 --> 01:48:51.751
Spread the news
about the leprosarium quickly

01:48:57.959 --> 01:49:00.376
It's time I rise to revolt

01:49:38.334 --> 01:49:40.334
You had once asked me who is in my heart

01:49:43.584 --> 01:49:44.584
Now I know

01:49:52.918 --> 01:49:53.834
Fei!

01:50:02.293 --> 01:50:04.251
Help me put this on for Fiery

01:50:19.376 --> 01:50:21.251
Let's remember his righteousness!

01:50:31.668 --> 01:50:32.543
Brother

01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:35.626
It's time for us to fight back

01:50:45.501 --> 01:50:46.001
I

01:50:48.543 --> 01:50:49.376
Wong Fei Hung

01:50:53.501 --> 01:50:55.376
will never forget our dream

01:51:04.418 --> 01:51:06.334
I hereby swear

01:51:07.334 --> 01:51:08.334
I will unify the people

01:51:09.834 --> 01:51:10.915
Rise against all challenges

01:51:12.793 --> 01:51:14.209
Stand up against all evil

01:51:15.834 --> 01:51:23.834
Unity! Dignity!

01:51:30.626 --> 01:51:32.026
300 workers held at the leprosarium

01:51:32.542 --> 01:51:33.542
Take a look! Take a look!

01:51:33.543 --> 01:51:34.668
300 workers illegally held

01:51:34.751 --> 01:51:35.876
300 workers illegally held

01:51:37.751 --> 01:51:38.459
Take a look!

01:51:50.543 --> 01:51:51.459
Let them go!

01:51:52.876 --> 01:51:54.793
Stand back

01:52:01.543 --> 01:52:04.418
Whoever can bring me the head of Fei

01:52:06.668 --> 01:52:09.418
Will be my sole adopted son!

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.334
Where're they!

01:52:13.834 --> 01:52:14.876
Tell me! Tell me!

01:53:07.668 --> 01:53:08.418
Go!

01:53:12.501 --> 01:53:13.001
Wait

01:53:29.793 --> 01:53:30.459
Where're they?

01:53:30.668 --> 01:53:31.626
I let them go

01:53:32.668 --> 01:53:34.793
You idiot! What are you talking about?

01:53:34.959 --> 01:53:35.876
You're wrong!

01:53:37.418 --> 01:53:39.668
I'm a martial arts practitioner!

01:53:43.334 --> 01:53:43.834
Get him!

01:54:01.459 --> 01:54:05.834
Master, the foreigners
at the leprosarium have withdrawn suddenly

01:54:06.668 --> 01:54:07.501
Hurry!

01:54:08.459 --> 01:54:10.334
Ask our men
at the leprosarium to withdraw too

01:54:21.376 --> 01:54:23.709
I want to save and set them free as well!

01:54:28.209 --> 01:54:31.834
Someone set us free!

01:54:42.876 --> 01:54:50.876
We want revenge! Fight
the Black Tiger Gang!

01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:58.751
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!

01:54:59.418 --> 01:55:01.917
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!

01:55:01.918 --> 01:55:09.918
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death...

01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:20.792
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!

01:55:20.793 --> 01:55:22.193
We have no fear for injury or death

01:55:22.543 --> 01:55:24.543
We won't back off today

01:55:24.793 --> 01:55:26.876
We want to get even with you

01:55:27.418 --> 01:55:35.418
We won't back off! We won't back off!

01:55:37.334 --> 01:55:37.959
Quiet please!

01:55:42.668 --> 01:55:43.376
Master Lei

01:55:43.834 --> 01:55:44.793
We have 500 men here

01:55:45.834 --> 01:55:47.709
If we all fight, it will be a bloodshed

01:55:48.876 --> 01:55:49.709
Why don't...

01:55:51.334 --> 01:55:52.668
you and I have a duel?

01:55:54.793 --> 01:55:56.959
I will challenge you with my life!

01:55:57.668 --> 01:56:00.626
You betray me for the sake of these workers

01:56:01.501 --> 01:56:02.822
Have they been treating you well?

01:56:03.584 --> 01:56:04.793
I know I owe you righteousness

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:07.906
I can only repay in my next life

01:56:09.293 --> 01:56:11.793
But you owe them justice!
You have to repay it today!

01:56:12.293 --> 01:56:12.793
Bullshit!

01:56:13.418 --> 01:56:18.293
Let them all understand crystal clear

01:56:18.459 --> 01:56:19.418
Who is...

01:56:19.834 --> 01:56:21.751
the master here!

01:56:22.334 --> 01:56:26.333
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

01:56:26.334 --> 01:56:26.875
People!

01:56:26.876 --> 01:56:28.668
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

01:56:32.668 --> 01:56:33.834
If I die,

01:56:36.959 --> 01:56:38.800
none of you should take any action
on my behalf

01:56:39.501 --> 01:56:40.834
Think about your families

01:56:41.793 --> 01:56:43.334
They are waiting for you at home

01:56:43.668 --> 01:56:44.459
Fei

01:56:44.959 --> 01:56:45.918
Can you win?

01:56:50.668 --> 01:56:51.908
If both sides get into a fight,

01:56:52.876 --> 01:56:54.501
there will be a lot of casualties

01:56:55.584 --> 01:56:56.501
It's better I die

01:56:57.334 --> 01:56:59.094
Than to have the whole place drowned
in blood

01:57:00.584 --> 01:57:01.376
Promise me

01:57:03.793 --> 01:57:04.751
If I fall,

01:57:05.793 --> 01:57:08.376
you have to make them go home

01:57:17.584 --> 01:57:18.376
Let him in

01:57:26.584 --> 01:57:27.251
Close the door!

01:58:01.334 --> 01:58:02.501
You want to burn me to death?

01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:12.668
Die together?

01:58:12.751 --> 01:58:13.584
Not entirely

01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:17.501
I want to burn this place down

01:58:18.418 --> 01:58:20.418
and revitalize this pier

01:58:21.334 --> 01:58:22.084
How naive!

01:58:28.626 --> 01:58:29.626
Go ahead

01:58:32.501 --> 01:58:34.376
I'll show you what's true darkness

02:00:32.459 --> 02:00:33.917
Hurry! Hurry! Over here! Over here!

02:00:33.918 --> 02:00:35.417
Give me the bucket!

02:00:35.418 --> 02:00:36.375
Hurry! Hurry!

02:00:36.376 --> 02:00:38.001
Hurry! Pass it over!

02:00:38.876 --> 02:00:39.543
Hurry!

02:00:39.751 --> 02:00:41.917
Hurry! Pass it over! Quick!

02:00:41.918 --> 02:00:43.584
Put out the fire!

02:00:45.459 --> 02:00:46.918
Hurry! Hurry! Over here!

02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:49.584
Over here! Over here!

02:00:49.959 --> 02:00:50.834
Quick! Over there!

02:01:01.834 --> 02:01:02.584
Getting hot?

02:01:04.418 --> 02:01:04.918
I'm alright

02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:08.334
You set the fire! Come on!

02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:56.708
Run! Run!

02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:58.918
The warehouse is gone.
They can't get out now

02:03:03.584 --> 02:03:04.543
Let's retreat!

02:03:07.626 --> 02:03:08.709
Run!

02:03:44.668 --> 02:03:45.376
Hot?

02:03:46.334 --> 02:03:46.834
Hot!

02:05:06.293 --> 02:05:08.751
I don't need you to save me

02:05:09.418 --> 02:05:10.668
You don't deserve it

02:05:23.626 --> 02:05:24.793
Don't pretend you care

02:05:25.501 --> 02:05:26.834
Do you think by killing me

02:05:26.876 --> 02:05:28.668
this world will be a better place?

02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:30.584
You're too naive!

02:05:31.376 --> 02:05:31.876
Lei

02:05:43.543 --> 02:05:46.334
You think it's that easy to be a hero?

02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:49.501
There'll always be another villain
on the lurk

02:05:50.793 --> 02:05:52.918
You will soon be like me

02:05:53.834 --> 02:05:56.959
Because that's your destiny

02:07:04.543 --> 02:07:05.459
Father

02:07:06.918 --> 02:07:08.626
I'd like to borrow your umbrella
