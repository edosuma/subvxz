Stan, put that box right up there.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.645
Declan, take that box into the office.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.110
"Grady"?

14:29.619 --> 14:30.744
All this goes, too?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.454
Uh, yeah.

14:33.748 --> 14:34.831
I think so.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.124
What about this room?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.252
Oh, God, there's so many
rooms in this house.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.628
(CHUCKLES) I know.

14:42.924 --> 14:43.924
Oh, boy.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.092
Maps.

14:45.510 --> 14:46.718
Paper work.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.346
Maps and more maps.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.640
(THUMP)

15:29.804 --> 15:32.097
"Hammerhand will find the weak.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.309
"Hurl them down to rot and reek.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.270
"Bash your skull and toss you in.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.858
"Your pain is short.
Your blood runs thin.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.737
"The strong are spared
to breed and spawn.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.074
<i>"Graze around the devil's yawn."</i>

16:31.532 --> 16:32.616
What are you doing?

16:32.700 --> 16:35.077
Um, just going over all these papers.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.081
The kids are starving.
Do you want to go eat?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.624
Yeah, I'm hungry.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.501
-Yeah, me, too.
-Look at this.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.877
-Is that this house?
-Yes.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.504
-Look at that.
-Wow.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.048
That was taken
in the '30s. Look at that car.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.508
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:50.301 --> 16:52.260
Isn't it great? Look at the yard.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.179
(CHUCKLING)
Doesn't look like that now.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.722
No. But it will again.

16:55.807 --> 16:56.932
Think so?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.016
After you mow it.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.267
(LAUGHS)

17:01.938 --> 17:03.438
Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.272
Okay.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.817
(CHUCKLES)

17:40.268 --> 17:41.309
LEAH: Kristen...

17:41.644 --> 17:43.186
Would you mind
hanging up the phone...

17:43.271 --> 17:44.271
Where'd you get that jacket?

17:44.355 --> 17:46.106
...and joining
the rest of us for dinner, please?

17:46.190 --> 17:47.524
-It's Grady's.
-All right, then...

17:47.608 --> 17:48.775
Hot drinks. Who had the tea?

17:48.860 --> 17:50.235
-COOPER: Oh, she had the tea.
-You had the tea?

17:50.319 --> 17:51.903
-LEAH: Yeah.
-Tea for you.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.406
And coffee for you.
And cream and sugar?

17:54.490 --> 17:55.615
-I'll take some cream.
-Cream.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.076
How do they have any right
to be dumping his stuff?

17:58.161 --> 18:00.287
They bought it.
They bought everything in it.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.414
So? They could rent a locker.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.999
They could put it in storage.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.042
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

18:06.878 --> 18:07.961
And the cream.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.087
-COOPER: Oh, thanks.
-Great.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.255
Everything's, uh... Food's okay?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.465
-Yeah, good. Yeah.
-Everything's good?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.633
(CHUCKLES)
Hey, I'm Cooper, by the way.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.051
Ah. Ray Pinski.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.261
-How are you?
-Great to meet you.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.679
-This is Leah. Kristen.
-Leah. Hi.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.930
Jesse.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.141
-Uh, Jesse? (LAUGH)
-Yeah.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.434
-Kristen.
-Ray...

18:22.518 --> 18:24.186
-Ray?
-Oh, uh, my wife.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.438
I'm Ellen Pinski. Hi.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.106
This is our daughter, Stephanie.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.274
Hi.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.234
-Hi. Leah.
-Hi.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.653
Do you, uh... Do you kids like horses?

18:33.738 --> 18:34.905
Mom...

18:35.198 --> 18:36.865
-COOPER: Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah. Sure.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.284
Well, Stephanie has a horse,

18:39.368 --> 18:41.036
and I think he needs feeding right now.

18:41.871 --> 18:42.954
Would that be okay?

18:43.039 --> 18:44.247
-Oh. Yeah, sure. Hey. Hey.
-Oh, yeah.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.832
-Cool.
-COOPER: Want to go?

18:45.917 --> 18:47.626
LEAH:
Kristen, why don't you go, too?

18:47.710 --> 18:50.378
Hmm? Go on. Go.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.255
I said... I said, "Go."

18:52.340 --> 18:53.590
Go. Now.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.967
And why don't you
leave that cell phone here with me?

18:56.052 --> 18:58.929
Then if someone calls,
I can tell 'em where you are.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.308
They're at that age.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.726
COOPER: (SIGHS)
She's tough.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.936
LEAH: (CHUCKLING) Yeah.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.521
Kids love horses, though. I mean...

19:07.605 --> 19:09.648
Well, basically, she loves cell phones,

19:09.732 --> 19:11.900
but I'm hoping she'll
move into horses eventually.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.735
(LAUGHS)

19:13.945 --> 19:15.070
(LAUGHS)

19:15.404 --> 19:17.489
Hey, uh... Really, come on. Sit down.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.032
(LAUGHS) Okay.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.701
-Are they...
-RAY: I really shouldn't, though.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.454
Oh, good.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.582
They're bonding with the Pinskis.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.251
(LAUGHS)

19:29.335 --> 19:30.418
Hmm?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.003
-RAY: Five, actually. Five.
-ELLEN: Five.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.797
Well, then, you're locals, then, huh?

19:33.881 --> 19:34.840
Oh, well...

19:34.924 --> 19:35.924
(LAUGHING) Well, I mean...

19:36.008 --> 19:37.509
(CLEARS THROAT)
I wouldn't go that far,

19:37.593 --> 19:38.677
-but, uh...
-Yeah.

19:38.761 --> 19:39.845
RAY: We've been here
a long time.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.680
ELLEN: Yeah.
Takes time to get there.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.099
I mean, we send everyone
Christmas cards every year.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.600
-The Christmas cards.
-But...

19:45.935 --> 19:47.060
Haven't got one back yet.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.937
Okay, now, this is a bit of a sore point,

19:49.021 --> 19:50.730
but, I mean, I don't think
it's anything personal, you know?

19:50.815 --> 19:53.191
Did you guys get a card?
I didn't get a card.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.818
MAN 1 : I got two cards.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.486
-Oh, you're kidding?
-I got your card maybe.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.196
-MAN 2: You didn't get a card.
-MAN 1 : I got a card.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.322
I didn't get a card. I'm so upset.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.448
MAN 1 : I got two, yeah.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.616
RAY: It was about to
fall down.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.201
-The ceiling was coming down.
-It was empty.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.203
Well, you're putting money back
into the community.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.372
-Exactly.
-Money back into the community.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.124
-That's right, Cooper.
-Money back into the community.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.709
-That's what we always say.
-Yeah.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.252
-We always say that.
-Yeah.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.297
How about that blue truck

20:15.381 --> 20:16.548
-out in the...
-Out front?

20:16.632 --> 20:17.674
Parking lot? Yeah.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.384
-Is it for sale?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.219
He wants the truck. You want the truck?

20:21.304 --> 20:22.679
Well, I might, yes.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.389
-LEAH: We do?
-We need a second car.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.682
LEAH: Well, that's
news to me.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.392
-They gotta take it.
-(LAUGHS) It's a great truck.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.560
I mean, it's a beautiful truck.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.895
I'll do you a good deal on it.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.062
Ray'll do you good.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.731
-You better.
-Oh, I will. (LAUGHS)

20:32.815 --> 20:34.482
-(SIGHS)
-RAY: Could use a little work.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.330
Okay...

20:52.835 --> 20:55.462
Okay, I want you to close your eyes.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.422
-Close your eyes.
-I wonder what this could be...

20:57.506 --> 20:58.506
(LAUGHING)

20:58.591 --> 20:59.591
Okay. Here comes a step.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.051
-Ready? Step.
-Step. Step.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.928
Here comes another step. Ready? Step.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.304
-I'm stepping.
-Whoa.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.139
Okay, our neigh-bors are here.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.265
(LAUGHING) No.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.934
Hi, Ray. Ellen.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.101
-Good morning.
-Hello.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.562
COOPER: What do you think
Stephanie's holding?

21:12.647 --> 21:13.897
Well, take a look.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.399
-Oh, my God!
-(LAUGHTER)

21:16.484 --> 21:18.693
You guys are the best!

21:20.696 --> 21:22.030
She likes it.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.448
Well, what are you waiting for?

21:23.532 --> 21:24.532
(NEIGHS)

21:24.617 --> 21:25.659
Oh...

21:25.743 --> 21:27.285
RAY: See her eyes?
They just lit right up, huh?

21:27.370 --> 21:29.621
-She loves it.
-LEAH: Ah...

21:30.456 --> 21:31.706
Want some coffee?

21:31.791 --> 21:32.791
Oh, I'd love some.

21:32.875 --> 21:33.959
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Come on in.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.460
She's so surprised.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.670
Hey, Ray.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.046
Hey, good to see you.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.465
Okay, have fun.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.973
RAY: Don't tell me
that you did this all on your own.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.683
COOPER:
This is my office.

21:50.351 --> 21:52.018
-This is your office?
-Yeah.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.228
What's all this stuff?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.313
It's all, uh, things from the family

21:55.398 --> 21:56.564
that lived here before.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.732
The family that lived here before?

21:57.817 --> 21:58.858
Yeah, the Massies.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.318
-Gosh, look at your gardens.
-RAY: Holy...

22:00.403 --> 22:01.736
What's this? (LAUGHS)

22:01.821 --> 22:03.154
What's this? Final days?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.531
Well, this is a timeline of the...

22:04.615 --> 22:06.324
-Hey, Ellen, look at this.
-...of the Massie family.

22:06.409 --> 22:07.951
-It's incredible.
-That's incredible.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.244
What a project.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.246
-Well, it's what I do. I do documentaries.
-Yeah.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.455
Yeah, it's, uh...

22:12.540 --> 22:13.707
ELLEN:
What's this?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.709
COOPER: Oh, that's, uh,
the family that lived here before.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.002
That's the pool.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.378
-(BEEPS)
-RAY: Oh, listen, hey...

22:18.462 --> 22:20.672
If you guys want to swim,
just come over to our pool.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.173
That's... That's, uh...

22:22.258 --> 22:23.466
-Uh, that's Grady.
-That's Lorna.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.509
-No, it's Lorna.
-Grady and...

22:24.593 --> 22:25.760
Where'd you get that?

22:26.637 --> 22:27.721
COOPER: These tapes?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.055
RAY: They were beautiful kids.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.265
LEAH: Well, they're gonna want
that back.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.641
COOPER: Well, they can have it.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.059
RAY: You just found the tapes here?

22:33.144 --> 22:34.227
COOPER: They were in a closet.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.520
RAY: In a closet?

22:35.604 --> 22:36.938
We bought the house and the contents.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.356
How much of this footage do you have?

22:38.441 --> 22:40.358
Oh, miles and miles.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.235
<i>MAN ON TAPE: What are you trying
to do there, buddy?</i>

22:42.319 --> 22:46.156
"Hammerhand will bash your skull...

22:46.240 --> 22:48.533
"And throw you down the devil's throat.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.412
"Hammerhand will bash your skull..."

22:54.457 --> 22:56.541
Were you surprised
when they went on...

22:56.625 --> 22:58.877
Yeah, I thought... I thought that you...

23:09.638 --> 23:10.722
-KRISTEN: Hey, Dad? Yeah?
-Yeah?

23:10.806 --> 23:13.391
Thanks so much
for Chester. I really love him.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.644
I don't want any present
for the next, like, five years, seriously.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.272
Yeah, I really believe that.
(CLEARS THROAT)

23:19.356 --> 23:21.357
I'm glad, honey. Are you happy here?

23:21.776 --> 23:24.611
I'm so happy. I really like Stephanie, too.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.112
We like the same kind of stuff.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.866
What about Jesse? Think he's happy?

23:30.159 --> 23:31.326
I think he's happy.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.871
But he's really into Grady
and all his old stuff.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.624
COOPER: All his army garments.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.000
KRISTEN: Exactly.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.461
COOPER: It's a phase.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.213
KRISTEN: I think it's really creepy.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.589
COOPER: Yeah.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.633
Think he'll go to college like that?

23:46.717 --> 23:48.802
KRISTEN: (CHUCKLES) I hope not.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.180
COOPER: Think they'd send him
back to us?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.807
KRISTEN: Yeah.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.850
Actually, he'd probably like that...

24:16.664 --> 24:17.997
(WHISPERING) Dad...

24:18.582 --> 24:20.291
There's some really, really weird guy

24:20.376 --> 24:21.584
looking at all your stuff.

24:21.669 --> 24:22.669
What?
