00:27.158 --> 00:28.859
Trey?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.677
Trey?

03:48.060 --> 03:50.110
Hey, baby girl.

03:51.479 --> 03:54.864
Where did you go last night, Daddy?

03:57.485 --> 04:01.371
Ohh, come here.

04:04.576 --> 04:07.460
You want to get married someday, Alice?

04:07.495 --> 04:08.795
I do.

04:08.829 --> 04:13.083
Then never ask a man where he's been.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.709
Morning.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.594
Hey.

04:57.628 --> 04:59.296
Cook you some eggs?

04:59.298 --> 05:01.381
Uh, no time. Sorry.

05:04.469 --> 05:07.137
Who's calling?

05:07.139 --> 05:10.140
Telemarketer or something.

05:10.142 --> 05:13.059
I-I made you a sandwich... Ham and cheese.

05:15.146 --> 05:18.782
Appreciate it. I got to run.

05:18.816 --> 05:21.735
Seems like you've always got to run.

05:21.786 --> 05:23.653
Better busy than not, right?

05:25.323 --> 05:28.625
It means things are working out.

05:28.659 --> 05:32.295
Baby gets a new pair of shoes... Maybe two.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.797
I'm really proud of you, Teddy.

05:41.756 --> 05:43.056
You took a risk.

05:43.090 --> 05:47.310
This rim business takes... courage,

05:47.345 --> 05:48.978
and it takes faith.

05:50.481 --> 05:53.650
Yeah, faith.

05:59.523 --> 06:02.325
I'll see you tonight.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.088
Hello?

06:15.122 --> 06:16.506
You have a collect call from...

06:16.540 --> 06:17.624
Daniel.

06:17.675 --> 06:19.376
Will you accept the charges?

06:22.213 --> 06:26.049
Um... yes.

06:28.886 --> 06:31.604
Oh, sh-shit!

06:31.639 --> 06:33.356
Good morning.

06:34.726 --> 06:36.142
I'm sorry, Ted.

06:36.193 --> 06:39.062
I've heard worse.

06:39.064 --> 06:42.399
No, I mean... I'm sorry about the kitchen,

06:42.401 --> 06:43.900
about... how things are.

06:43.902 --> 06:47.287
I'm getting kind of used to it.

06:47.321 --> 06:49.759
I thought he'd stay home for a while.

06:49.759 --> 06:51.291
I really did.

06:51.325 --> 06:52.475
He'll turn up.

06:52.510 --> 06:55.662
You just see how damaged he is.

06:55.713 --> 06:59.165
You just wonder if he'll ever be...

06:59.216 --> 07:02.469
It's still early. He hasn't been out long.

07:02.503 --> 07:06.256
I never really believed
he would get out, Ted.

07:06.258 --> 07:09.559
Not the way Amantha believes.

07:10.895 --> 07:12.562
I just couldn't have that kind of hope.

07:12.596 --> 07:15.932
I know you couldn't.

07:15.934 --> 07:19.436
Lately, I've had this... Gnawing guilt

07:19.438 --> 07:23.106
that... if I believed in him enough,

07:23.108 --> 07:25.108
if I'd loved him enough, I could help more

07:25.110 --> 07:27.177
in getting him out of that dreadful place.

07:27.211 --> 07:29.662
If Amantha hadn't been Amantha,

07:29.697 --> 07:31.998
he'd still be in there, Ted.

07:32.032 --> 07:33.583
You're being too hard on yourself, now.

07:34.919 --> 07:36.252
Every time I see him,

07:36.287 --> 07:38.538
I think about how I've failed him.

07:38.589 --> 07:40.523
You've lost perspective, Janet.

07:40.558 --> 07:44.561
You're just not seeing
things clearly right now.

07:44.595 --> 07:46.212
That's kind.

07:46.263 --> 07:49.966
But I think I'm seeing
things very clearly, Ted.

07:52.136 --> 07:54.521
I'm sorry about what I said the other day,

07:54.555 --> 07:56.473
about this being his house first.

07:59.143 --> 08:02.562
You... you saved this house, Ted.

08:02.613 --> 08:07.400
You saved the store, this family.

08:07.451 --> 08:09.619
You saved me.

08:09.653 --> 08:13.289
But I've never loved
you the way you deserved.

08:13.324 --> 08:16.493
And I'm very sorry about that.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.668
It's not too late, is it?

08:28.272 --> 08:30.507
I knew you could never love me

08:30.541 --> 08:32.775
the same way you loved Lester.

08:32.809 --> 08:36.578
I knew that.

08:36.614 --> 08:40.567
Or the way you might
have if Daniel hadn't...

08:40.601 --> 08:43.253
If things had been different.

08:43.287 --> 08:47.440
Not saying I liked it, but I understood.

08:47.491 --> 08:51.160
So I imagine I can accept you

08:51.195 --> 08:54.280
wanting to make things better between us.

09:53.674 --> 09:57.427
After you called, I just
got in the car, and I left.

09:59.597 --> 10:02.181
I've never done anything that impulsive,

10:02.232 --> 10:04.601
not in my whole life.

10:19.750 --> 10:23.670
I can't remember the last
time I-I used a pay phone...

10:23.704 --> 10:26.122
The last time I saw one, even.

10:28.592 --> 10:31.694
They're hard to find.

10:31.729 --> 10:34.597
But it felt good

10:34.632 --> 10:38.051
to use a telephone that
wasn't smarter than me.

10:43.807 --> 10:46.643
Are you okay, Daniel?

10:46.645 --> 10:50.229
The only time that I've ever felt okay

10:50.280 --> 10:52.615
was when I was with you.

11:03.827 --> 11:08.464
Well, we... we'd better get on the road,

11:08.499 --> 11:10.249
so we can get back before...

11:12.936 --> 11:15.004
I suppose we should.

11:29.103 --> 11:30.570
Let's just see if he's here.

11:30.604 --> 11:31.738
And if he's not?

11:31.772 --> 11:32.994
She'll know something's up.

11:32.994 --> 11:35.158
- She's my mother.
- Exactly.

11:35.192 --> 11:36.359
Then I'll have to tell her.

11:38.029 --> 11:39.445
Maybe Daniel will just fire me.

11:39.496 --> 11:42.532
He won't fire you. You're free.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.283
Well, at least he's
getting his money's worth.

11:44.334 --> 11:45.501
I'm sorry, Jon.

11:45.536 --> 11:48.337
We're dysfunctional... You included.

11:48.372 --> 11:50.289
But it's better you're
here to fill in the gaps

11:50.340 --> 11:52.175
when she starts asking all those questions.

11:54.678 --> 11:55.678
Mama?

11:55.713 --> 11:59.549
Mama?

11:59.551 --> 12:01.350
Oh. Hey, Mom.

12:01.385 --> 12:02.635
Hey.

12:02.686 --> 12:04.137
We just thought we'd stop by.

12:04.188 --> 12:05.354
Okay.

12:05.389 --> 12:06.889
Is Daniel here, by chance?

12:06.891 --> 12:09.142
What's wrong?

12:09.193 --> 12:10.893
That took 10 seconds.

12:20.537 --> 12:26.659
We almost moved here, me and
Ted, after we got married.

12:26.710 --> 12:28.878
Florida?

12:28.912 --> 12:31.631
Teddy wanted to start a new
branch of the tire store,

12:31.665 --> 12:33.750
break out on his own.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.836
He had all these grand plans.

12:36.887 --> 12:40.590
But he just couldn't leave town.

12:40.592 --> 12:44.343
Couldn't leave his family.

12:44.394 --> 12:46.095
It's not easy to leave

12:46.097 --> 12:48.898
the only thing you've ever known.

12:51.602 --> 12:54.153
How's he doing?

12:54.188 --> 12:56.739
What do you mean?

12:56.774 --> 12:59.909
Is he happy?

12:59.943 --> 13:04.163
Lately... he's been happy.

13:04.198 --> 13:07.116
I'm glad.

13:07.118 --> 13:09.619
What is it, Daniel?

13:11.455 --> 13:14.540
I'm not a good person, Tawney.

13:14.591 --> 13:17.844
I don't believe that.

13:17.878 --> 13:20.546
I'm telling you the truth.

13:35.175 --> 13:37.559
How's retirement suiting you?

13:37.593 --> 13:40.011
Ain't took to it yet.

13:40.013 --> 13:42.814
I hope there's no hard feelings still.

13:42.849 --> 13:46.601
If it wasn't you, been
somebody else took my job, Carl.

13:46.652 --> 13:49.237
Guess folks are ready for a change.

13:49.272 --> 13:52.741
Something's been gnawing at me.

13:52.775 --> 13:55.777
That'll happen in this line of work.

13:55.828 --> 13:57.445
When Holden got out,

13:57.496 --> 14:00.832
he said you had doubts he was the killer.

14:03.502 --> 14:04.786
You want to elaborate?

14:04.837 --> 14:07.873
What would be the point, Carl?

14:07.875 --> 14:11.877
You weren't surprised about
the DNA results, were you?

14:13.462 --> 14:15.764
Wasn't shocked, no.

14:15.798 --> 14:17.048
Why not?

14:21.889 --> 14:24.773
We thought we were doing
the right thing, Carl.

14:24.807 --> 14:25.891
And what was that?

14:25.925 --> 14:28.860
- Prosecuting Holden.
- And now?

14:28.895 --> 14:30.812
Roland was convinced.

14:30.863 --> 14:34.149
Eventually, I became convinced, too.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.784
But not initially.

14:35.818 --> 14:39.204
There were some
conflicting stories at first

14:39.238 --> 14:40.956
with the kids and all.

14:40.990 --> 14:42.791
What stories?

14:42.825 --> 14:45.994
But Holden put an end to that.

14:46.045 --> 14:47.379
By confessing.

14:47.413 --> 14:48.747
By confessing.

14:50.249 --> 14:53.585
What happened in that
interrogation room, C.J.?

14:53.587 --> 14:56.421
You don't get the truth too easily, Carl.

14:56.423 --> 14:57.505
You know that.

14:57.556 --> 14:59.257
So we put pressure on him.

14:59.292 --> 15:04.095
He seemed like... A boy who was lying,

15:04.097 --> 15:06.398
saying he couldn't remember things,

15:06.432 --> 15:07.933
saying he didn't recall,

15:07.935 --> 15:10.568
said that he was with a girl for a while.

15:10.603 --> 15:13.855
And we would press him for details.

15:13.906 --> 15:15.907
He ever ask for a lawyer?

15:15.942 --> 15:18.076
Not that I recall.

15:20.079 --> 15:23.999
Anyway, we kept talking to him,

15:24.033 --> 15:25.867
and eventually, he started coming around.

15:25.918 --> 15:28.036
- To the confession?
- Yeah.

15:28.087 --> 15:31.623
And now you think it might
have been forced or coerced?

15:31.657 --> 15:35.210
Didn't think there was
such a thing back then.

15:35.261 --> 15:40.632
Now... I'm not certain either way.

15:40.634 --> 15:44.936
But could I see how it might have happened?

15:44.971 --> 15:48.056
In hindsight.

15:52.979 --> 15:55.563
I'm not looking to go after you, C.J.,

15:55.614 --> 15:58.149
or Roland or anybody.

15:58.151 --> 16:01.369
I just want to make sure
we get it right this time

16:01.404 --> 16:02.821
before it's too late.

16:05.124 --> 16:07.792
What?

16:07.827 --> 16:12.464
After Holden confessed
and the trial was over,

16:12.498 --> 16:15.583
George Melton asked to see me.

16:15.634 --> 16:18.720
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

16:18.754 --> 16:20.555
I wouldn't talk to him.

16:20.589 --> 16:22.223
Why wouldn't you talk to him?

16:22.258 --> 16:23.391
It was over.

16:23.426 --> 16:25.677
We believed that we had our man.

16:25.679 --> 16:28.263
That poor girl was in the ground.

16:28.314 --> 16:31.182
The town was beginning to settle down.

16:31.217 --> 16:36.187
It was too late. It was just too late.

16:38.524 --> 16:41.192
Mom, they're just looking for a way out.

16:41.227 --> 16:43.528
They're also trying to save face.

16:43.562 --> 16:46.531
If we push back too hard,
it could become personal,

16:46.533 --> 16:47.866
and then all bets are off.

16:47.868 --> 16:49.117
Become personal?

16:49.168 --> 16:51.503
For the D.A., not the original players.

16:51.537 --> 16:54.456
I can't imagine Mr. Foulkes
being behind a plea deal.

16:54.507 --> 16:55.707
He's a narcissist.

16:55.741 --> 16:58.843
Well, I'm sure he's aware of it.

16:58.878 --> 17:00.962
Miss person is pragmatic, if nothing else.

17:01.013 --> 17:03.515
Does she even care whether
he's guilty or innocent?

17:03.549 --> 17:04.682
I don't know.

17:04.717 --> 17:06.267
I don't like her already.

17:06.301 --> 17:09.471
Well, at least she plays
by rules I can understand.

17:09.521 --> 17:11.940
I still don't like her.

17:11.973 --> 17:13.308
Oh, hey, Jared.

17:13.358 --> 17:15.443
I didn't know you were here.

17:15.478 --> 17:17.061
I had to pick up something.

17:20.199 --> 17:21.232
What's up?

17:23.069 --> 17:25.319
Just having a discussion.

17:25.371 --> 17:28.957
Okay. Cool.

17:28.991 --> 17:32.577
Jared. Have you seen Daniel?

17:32.579 --> 17:35.880
Uh, not since he took my bike yesterday.

17:35.915 --> 17:38.216
- Took your bike?
- Yesterday.

17:38.250 --> 17:39.884
Why didn't you say anything, honey?

17:39.919 --> 17:42.337
Since when do we start telling everybody

17:42.388 --> 17:43.755
everything around here?

17:57.903 --> 18:03.191
My dad used to bring us
out here when we were kids.

18:03.242 --> 18:05.443
I just wanted you to see it, that's all.

18:05.478 --> 18:08.746
It's lovely.

18:11.117 --> 18:13.585
You've seen it before.

18:13.619 --> 18:16.254
Doesn't change the fact
that it's beautiful.

18:18.874 --> 18:21.709
Why did you want me to get saved, Tawney?

18:21.760 --> 18:26.548
'Cause I wanted... you to have salvation.

18:26.599 --> 18:28.216
I wanted you to know peace.

18:28.267 --> 18:29.884
I still want that for you.

18:32.138 --> 18:34.189
And do you know peace, Tawney?

18:34.223 --> 18:37.308
Sometimes.

18:37.343 --> 18:39.711
And you think that peace comes from God?

18:39.745 --> 18:42.981
I know it doesn't come from ourselves.

18:43.015 --> 18:46.201
Do you believe that, or
do you have to believe that

18:46.235 --> 18:48.987
because otherwise, life
would be intolerable for you?

18:51.790 --> 18:54.792
I believe that because it's true.

18:54.827 --> 18:56.961
Or is it true because you believe it?

18:56.996 --> 19:01.216
Yes, both, I guess.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.551
So if I believe there is no God,

19:03.586 --> 19:05.637
then there is no God.

19:05.671 --> 19:07.088
It's not the same thing.

19:07.139 --> 19:08.256
Why not?

19:11.927 --> 19:14.312
'Cause you're just lost, Daniel.

19:17.149 --> 19:20.401
Something we can agree upon.

19:20.436 --> 19:24.155
I know God loves you, Daniel.

19:24.190 --> 19:26.908
You said that before.

19:26.942 --> 19:28.326
Or was it Jesus who loved me?

19:28.360 --> 19:29.861
They both do.

19:35.067 --> 19:38.453
Do you love me, Tawney?

19:44.710 --> 19:47.262
I'm married, Daniel.

19:47.296 --> 19:51.466
Then why did you make me
feel the way you made me feel?

19:51.517 --> 19:55.887
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

19:55.889 --> 19:58.473
Did you feel that way?

20:02.728 --> 20:06.030
You saved me, Tawney. Not some God.

20:07.733 --> 20:09.234
Then you forsook me.

20:12.738 --> 20:15.073
And now I'm lost.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.749
I know there's... There's
good in you, Daniel.

20:26.252 --> 20:27.719
And that goodness is God.

20:27.753 --> 20:29.220
You don't know me, Tawney.

20:29.255 --> 20:30.805
You only think you know me.

20:30.839 --> 20:32.840
You only see what you want to see.

20:32.891 --> 20:36.928
You don't know the
despicable things I've done.

20:36.962 --> 20:42.233
It doesn't change that
it's there... your goodness.

20:42.268 --> 20:46.988
But if you keep that goodness to yourself

20:47.022 --> 20:49.157
and you don't share it with the world,

20:49.191 --> 20:51.159
that's a greater sin than anything

20:51.193 --> 20:53.494
you think you might have done in the past.

20:53.529 --> 20:57.865
Anything... I might have done?

20:59.201 --> 21:02.086
Yes.

21:02.121 --> 21:04.255
Anything.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.768
I better go.

21:27.780 --> 21:30.114
You're gonna me a wonderful mother, Tawney.

21:30.149 --> 21:33.985
Congratulations.

21:35.621 --> 21:38.740
Daniel.

21:38.791 --> 21:40.958
I don't regret coming to get you today.

21:44.163 --> 21:45.997
But I can't do it again.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.385
And I won't.

21:50.419 --> 21:53.087
I know.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.711
Hey.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.596
Hey, buddy.

22:28.631 --> 22:33.351
I'm sorry. I-I...

22:33.386 --> 22:36.271
I'm sure you've all been worried.

22:36.305 --> 22:38.056
It's okay, honey.

22:38.058 --> 22:41.192
I've been biking.

22:42.978 --> 22:46.531
I need to talk to you, Daniel, in private.

22:46.565 --> 22:48.950
It's why I've been calling you.

22:48.984 --> 22:51.703
Is it a secret what you need to tell me?

22:54.273 --> 22:55.573
It should have been.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.908
I'm sorry, Daniel.

22:56.910 --> 22:59.494
I haven't been a very good lawyer lately.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.830
I haven't been a very good client.

23:06.919 --> 23:11.423
What is this secret that is not a secret?

23:11.425 --> 23:13.141
The district attorney has informed me

23:13.175 --> 23:15.176
that she's prepared to
offer you a plea deal.

23:16.679 --> 23:20.231
It would be time served plus 10 years.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.185
I think I can negotiate that down to 5.

23:26.605 --> 23:28.440
Would they go for 3?

23:28.474 --> 23:30.074
I could try.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.910
How about 2?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.077
Sure.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.114
See, Amantha? It is a game.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.920
Uh, we haven't worked
out the details, but...

23:41.954 --> 23:44.923
Does it matter if I'm guilty or not?

23:44.957 --> 23:46.708
What are you doing, Daniel?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.343
Clarifying.

23:48.377 --> 23:51.930
To those representing
the law, it should matter,

23:51.964 --> 23:53.431
but in this case, at this point in time,

23:53.466 --> 23:54.799
I would speculate

23:54.801 --> 23:56.718
that it's a secondary concern to them.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.554
Well, that's a relief.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.728
Go on, Jon.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.730
If you were to take this deal,

24:08.781 --> 24:11.483
there is no possible
way the state of Georgia

24:11.485 --> 24:13.868
could ever execute you for this crime.

24:13.903 --> 24:15.870
Seems only reasonable.

24:15.905 --> 24:21.626
But if I don't take the
deal, accept the deal...?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.995
The D.A. is saying
she'll take you to trial.

24:23.997 --> 24:25.547
And if I take the deal...?

24:25.581 --> 24:27.549
Depending on what's negotiated,

24:27.583 --> 24:30.168
you will eventually,
with some stipulations,

24:30.170 --> 24:31.503
be free.

24:35.758 --> 24:38.059
But it won't be freedom, Daniel.

24:38.093 --> 24:40.979
You will have to say that you killed Hanna,

24:41.013 --> 24:43.114
live the rest of your life
as a convicted murderer,

24:43.148 --> 24:44.282
sex offender...

24:44.316 --> 24:45.817
I won't admit to that.

24:45.851 --> 24:47.585
To what?

24:47.620 --> 24:48.820
That I raped her.

24:48.854 --> 24:50.255
Is that possible, Jon?

24:50.289 --> 24:52.590
I could certainly bring that to the D.A.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.158
What are you doing, Daniel?

24:54.193 --> 24:57.262
Discussing a plea deal.

24:57.296 --> 25:00.098
Did I miss something, Amantha?

25:00.132 --> 25:03.668
Are you saying you want to
go through with this, honey?

25:03.702 --> 25:08.907
I don't know, mother. It
was just presented to me.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.628
Right now...

25:14.713 --> 25:16.681
I would like to take a bath.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.506
Mighty quiet in there, Danny boy.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.741
Now, I have been talking to you all day,

25:43.776 --> 25:45.977
and you've yet to say a word in return.

25:46.011 --> 25:49.180
That's just rude, son.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.216
It appears that you have forgotten

25:52.251 --> 25:54.185
your papal instruction.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.688
What was it that the, uh...

25:56.722 --> 25:58.923
That old preacher man said to you?

25:58.958 --> 26:03.895
Charlie? Charlie the cheeseburger?

26:03.929 --> 26:07.665
He said, uh, "you got to reach out, boy.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.935
You got to engage."

26:10.970 --> 26:14.405
And there are so many
ways to engage in here.

26:14.440 --> 26:18.242
But therein lies the conflict...

26:18.277 --> 26:20.111
How to engage in the world,

26:20.113 --> 26:22.447
yet still ignore sweet Wendall.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.215
It ain't possible.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.752
You can't have one without the other.

26:27.786 --> 26:31.205
Can't have love without hate,

26:31.256 --> 26:35.293
light without darkness,
heaven without hell.

26:37.796 --> 26:42.934
You can't engage without engaging me.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.141
Heaven and hell.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.813
You're afraid, Wendall.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.616
Shit, boy.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.035
I ain't scared of nothing.

27:01.070 --> 27:03.705
I've never realized it till just now.

27:03.739 --> 27:06.074
What am I afraid of?

27:08.327 --> 27:10.662
Silence.

27:10.696 --> 27:15.433
Just 'cause a man likes to
talk don't mean he's afraid.

27:15.467 --> 27:19.370
Ah, there's more than one kind of silence.

27:22.091 --> 27:26.594
In the real world, you can live in denial,

27:26.645 --> 27:31.883
but not in here, not with
your death on the docket.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.688
How long you got left, Wendall?

27:36.722 --> 27:40.692
I bet you already know.

27:40.694 --> 27:44.078
I bet you're counting the days.

27:44.113 --> 27:47.665
And I bet you're terrified.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.842
Do you think you're above it, Holden? Hmm?!

27:57.876 --> 27:59.711
We ain't that different, you and me.

27:59.713 --> 28:02.547
Two sides of the same coin.

28:02.549 --> 28:07.185
We're not even the same currency.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.103
Yeah, you would like to
think that, wouldn't you?

28:09.138 --> 28:10.688
But even if I was

28:10.723 --> 28:14.392
some no-good bastard
who was afraid to die,

28:14.426 --> 28:19.814
you are just a punk-ass
bitch who is afraid to live.

28:22.568 --> 28:27.321
Two sides. Same coin.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.078
Which is worse?

28:37.049 --> 28:39.717
He can't make a decision right now,

28:39.752 --> 28:41.886
not on something this big.

28:41.888 --> 28:45.273
You heard him. He's not
thinking right, Mom.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.308
That's not gonna change
anytime soon, Amantha.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.810
His thinking.

28:48.861 --> 28:52.113
They're not gonna re-try
him, I just know it.

28:52.147 --> 28:55.283
There are 1,000 cases where
they've prosecuted with less.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.651
But if he even starts

28:56.702 --> 28:58.486
thinking about the possibility of it, Jon.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.455
God knows you have earned the right

29:00.489 --> 29:02.373
to tell him how you feel, Amantha,

29:02.407 --> 29:04.542
and you should, but ultimately,

29:04.576 --> 29:06.410
it's... it's his life, honey.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.046
How many conversations...

29:09.081 --> 29:10.381
Conversations?

29:10.415 --> 29:13.000
Have you had about me over the years?

29:13.051 --> 29:15.470
For me, for... for... For my benefit?

29:15.504 --> 29:17.305
I-I-I hope that
can end one day.

29:17.339 --> 29:21.976
I hope that you can talk
about something... else,

29:22.010 --> 29:24.428
like vacations or chihuahuas.

29:25.848 --> 29:28.683
I feel like grilling something.
Can we do that?

29:28.734 --> 29:30.985
I don't see why not.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.938
Steak. A big, fat steak.

29:33.940 --> 29:38.910
I want to hear the fat
hit the fire, smell it.

29:38.944 --> 29:44.081
Mr. Stern, tell them no more
time... zero, not one day.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.700
I can do that, Daniel,

29:45.751 --> 29:47.201
but I'm worried that it
would be a deal-breaker.

29:47.252 --> 29:50.254
A plea deal-breaker.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.840
Yes. The political cost
would be too high for them

29:52.875 --> 29:54.292
to just let you walk away.

29:56.795 --> 30:01.432
Ms. Holden, you have the floor.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.468
I say we call their bluff right now.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.473
Mother?

30:11.810 --> 30:14.028
I say we call Ted

30:14.062 --> 30:17.281
and ask him to pick up
some big, fat steaks.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.066
We have a plan.

30:19.117 --> 30:21.986
I'm gonna fire up that grill.

30:41.656 --> 30:43.273
Smells nice.

30:43.324 --> 30:46.276
I-I made you that mac and cheese you like,

30:46.327 --> 30:50.080
the one we were gonna have a few weeks ago.

30:50.114 --> 30:51.832
Date night.

30:51.866 --> 30:54.284
I-I screwed that up pretty good, huh?

30:54.335 --> 30:57.788
We all make mistakes.

30:57.839 --> 31:00.924
Maybe we can try again.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.961
I'll set the table.

31:14.055 --> 31:16.390
That was a fine steak, brother.

31:16.392 --> 31:19.643
I liked it, too.

31:22.897 --> 31:27.401
Well... I'm off to Thrifty Town.

31:27.403 --> 31:28.819
You working tonight?

31:28.870 --> 31:30.654
I am, mother.

31:30.705 --> 31:32.206
Kind of looking forward to it, too.

31:37.412 --> 31:39.413
You're changing, sister.

31:39.415 --> 31:41.832
I'm trying.

31:41.883 --> 31:45.168
I hope you know what you're doing, Daniel.

31:45.220 --> 31:47.421
Me too.

31:49.674 --> 31:50.757
Hey.

31:52.594 --> 31:55.178
I only want what's best for him.

31:55.230 --> 31:57.264
I'm not saying I know exactly what that is.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.568
It's not a plea deal.

32:25.543 --> 32:27.878
So, I'll go to the D.A. with your request.

32:27.929 --> 32:30.764
It's not a request.

32:30.798 --> 32:32.299
Understood.

32:34.302 --> 32:36.687
I'd like to listen to the tape.

32:36.721 --> 32:39.773
Tape?

32:39.807 --> 32:41.808
My confession.

32:41.843 --> 32:46.730
I haven't heard it since
the trial, and I'd like to.

32:46.781 --> 32:48.815
It's on my laptop in my car.

32:51.119 --> 32:54.655
It's not something that I
want anybody else to know,

32:54.657 --> 32:57.708
even in the family.

32:57.742 --> 33:00.294
Understood.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.640
Hey, buddy.

33:13.675 --> 33:15.225
What's going on?

33:15.259 --> 33:17.528
Uh, well

33:17.528 --> 33:18.979
Daniel's been offered a plea deal,

33:19.013 --> 33:20.514
so they're discussing it.

33:20.516 --> 33:21.682
A plea deal?

33:21.716 --> 33:22.983
It's a way to make sure

33:23.017 --> 33:24.985
he never has to go back to prison.

33:25.019 --> 33:26.236
By saying he did it.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.155
It's... it's not...

33:28.189 --> 33:30.190
I don't think he's made up his mind

33:30.192 --> 33:31.825
on what he wants to do.

33:31.859 --> 33:33.660
But if he takes a deal, he's
gonna say he killed Hanna.

33:33.695 --> 33:40.133
It's a way to... to move on, I guess.

33:40.168 --> 33:41.601
So he did it.

33:41.636 --> 33:43.337
No. Son, no.

33:43.371 --> 33:44.705
Wait, t-then why would he say he did?

33:44.707 --> 33:46.206
I don't understand.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.592
Uh, I don't fully
understand it all, myself,

33:48.626 --> 33:51.128
to be honest.

33:56.384 --> 33:59.886
Did you have a good day?

34:02.724 --> 34:06.526
Uh, same old, same old.

34:06.561 --> 34:09.529
How about you?

34:09.563 --> 34:11.565
Nothing to speak of, really.

34:14.318 --> 34:15.819
I came home at lunch today.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.489
I made you a lunch, Teddy.

34:19.540 --> 34:20.824
I know.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.708
I just wanted to see you, I guess.

34:22.744 --> 34:26.079
That's nice.

34:26.081 --> 34:28.415
So, where'd you go?

34:28.417 --> 34:31.802
I just had some errands to run.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.755
Boring stuff.

34:39.226 --> 34:43.179
Tawney, I know how hard
you work around here.

34:43.231 --> 34:47.434
I never meant to suggest otherwise.

34:47.467 --> 34:49.351
It's okay, Ted.

35:01.282 --> 35:03.700
- Hey, little bro.
- Hey.

35:03.751 --> 35:05.118
Everything okay?

35:05.120 --> 35:07.921
Uh, yeah, Dad said
maybe I should come over.

35:07.955 --> 35:09.089
I hope that's okay.

35:09.123 --> 35:10.340
Oh, you kidding? Come on in.

35:10.374 --> 35:11.591
We're just finishing up dinner.

35:11.626 --> 35:13.043
Have you eaten yet, Jared?

35:13.094 --> 35:14.628
Oh, I'm okay.

35:14.630 --> 35:16.430
You haven't. I'm gonna fix you a plate.

35:16.464 --> 35:18.849
Ted, did you want to grab the silverware?

35:18.883 --> 35:20.851
- I'm on it.
- No, really, I'm fine.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.719
Come on, you can't turn
down Tawney's Mac and cheese.

35:22.770 --> 35:24.221
That's one of the biggest sins.

35:24.272 --> 35:25.889
- Might even be in the Bible.
- Now.

35:25.940 --> 35:27.524
I could eat a little bit, I guess.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.526
So that's teenager for, "I'm starving."

35:30.812 --> 35:32.062
Can I get you something to drink?

35:32.113 --> 35:34.147
- Uh, sure.
- You want a beer?

35:34.149 --> 35:35.649
- Teddy.
- Oh.

35:35.651 --> 35:39.369
Mama said, "no big-boy beer.
Only little-man beer."

35:39.403 --> 35:41.204
Root beer for you, buddy.

35:47.628 --> 35:50.330
So, what's up?

35:50.332 --> 35:52.666
Uh, nothing much.

35:54.001 --> 35:57.220
Dad didn't send you over here for nothing.

35:57.255 --> 35:58.472
Oh.

35:58.506 --> 36:00.924
Uh, it's about Daniel.

36:00.975 --> 36:03.643
There's a shocker. What did he do now?

36:03.678 --> 36:07.180
Did nothing yet, but they
offered him some plea deal.

36:07.182 --> 36:08.982
A plea deal.

36:09.016 --> 36:10.901
Yeah, you know, to s-say he did it.

36:10.935 --> 36:12.519
You mean to say he killed Hanna?

36:12.521 --> 36:15.272
Then he goes free, Dad said.

36:15.323 --> 36:17.107
Did you know about this?

36:17.158 --> 36:19.993
How would I know about it, Ted?

36:20.027 --> 36:22.078
I don't know. I didn't
know if somebody called.

36:22.113 --> 36:24.698
I think it just happened today.

36:24.700 --> 36:28.001
Dad said it was a way for him to move on.

36:28.035 --> 36:31.621
But I still don't get why he'd
say he did it if he didn't.

36:31.672 --> 36:34.674
I don't know why he said it
the first time, much less.

36:34.709 --> 36:37.961
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

36:38.012 --> 36:41.264
I think I'm gonna go lie down.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.133
Are you feeling okay?

36:43.184 --> 36:45.051
I'm just tired, that's all.

36:46.387 --> 36:50.223
Oh. I got it. I'll clean up.

36:55.696 --> 36:56.980
Good night, Jared.

36:57.031 --> 36:59.366
It's nice to have you over here.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.618
You should come by more often.

37:01.652 --> 37:04.154
I'll be up in a little bit.

37:04.205 --> 37:06.323
Okay.

37:06.374 --> 37:08.241
You want a beer?

37:08.243 --> 37:10.293
Sure.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.914
You hardly touched your beer.

37:28.948 --> 37:30.248
Yeah.

37:30.283 --> 37:31.917
I don't really like
the taste, to be honest.

37:31.951 --> 37:34.202
First you hate it, then you love it.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.254
It's called beer.

37:43.546 --> 37:47.132
I won't let it go to waste, though.

37:47.134 --> 37:50.552
You think Bobby Dean's
gonna try and hurt him again

37:50.603 --> 37:51.887
when he finds out?

37:51.938 --> 37:53.972
Hard to say.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.777
Put yourself in Bobby's shoes.

37:58.811 --> 37:59.978
Mm-hmm.

37:59.980 --> 38:02.397
What would you do?

38:06.652 --> 38:09.371
Um, I guess I should probably head home.

38:09.405 --> 38:10.655
You know, Mom will worry.

38:10.657 --> 38:12.407
You want a ride?

38:12.458 --> 38:15.293
- No, I'm fine.
- Hey.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.130
You're nothing like him,

38:18.164 --> 38:20.332
if you're ever worried about that.

38:20.334 --> 38:22.501
I'm not worried.

38:27.006 --> 38:28.306
Be safe, buddy.

38:28.341 --> 38:29.841
Yeah. Good night.

38:46.859 --> 38:50.278
A lot on your plate, huh?

38:50.329 --> 38:54.449
You know, we've been thinking
about getting you some help.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.369
With the kitchen, I mean.

39:00.206 --> 39:01.790
I destroyed it.

39:03.459 --> 39:06.011
It's not destroyed.

39:07.380 --> 39:10.599
I don't know what I was thinking.

39:10.633 --> 39:12.934
Everybody does things they regret, Daniel.

39:12.969 --> 39:14.970
You still got time to make it right.

39:15.021 --> 39:16.471
Maybe so.

39:22.728 --> 39:26.314
You're a good man, Ted.

39:26.365 --> 39:30.235
I'm glad you married my mother.

39:32.488 --> 39:36.992
You know, I don't know if you
made your mind up yet or not.

39:37.043 --> 39:40.962
But if your mama could have
you here in the free world

39:40.997 --> 39:42.998
forever and always,

39:43.049 --> 39:48.303
well, the rest is just the small stuff.

39:55.895 --> 39:57.896
Excuse me, Daniel.

40:03.103 --> 40:05.904
Hello? This is Ted Talbot.

40:05.938 --> 40:07.439
Who's calling?

40:07.473 --> 40:11.526
This is certainly unexpected.

40:11.577 --> 40:12.744
Tonight?

40:14.947 --> 40:18.283
I suppose I could if it's urgent.

40:18.285 --> 40:21.953
Okay, then. See you there.

40:33.299 --> 40:36.134
She wanted to see what it was like.

40:36.136 --> 40:38.520
You mean sex?

40:38.554 --> 40:41.389
Mushrooms.

40:41.440 --> 40:46.228
You gave a 16-year-old
girl psycho-active drugs?

40:46.279 --> 40:49.114
And why would you do that?

40:49.148 --> 40:51.316
I shouldn't have.

40:51.350 --> 40:54.586
So, call me as soon as possible,
madam district attorney,

40:54.620 --> 40:57.055
and we can discuss where we go from here.

40:57.089 --> 41:01.793
But, as I said, Daniel
will not go back to prison,

41:01.827 --> 41:05.497
and any further discussion
has to start right there.

41:07.133 --> 41:11.336
The sex wasn't consensual, was it, Daniel?

41:11.338 --> 41:12.754
I left.

41:12.805 --> 41:14.723
After the sex, you mean?

41:14.757 --> 41:17.175
No, I-I don't know when.

41:19.145 --> 41:21.846
Well, there were others.

41:23.849 --> 41:27.185
You mean, with her?

41:27.187 --> 41:29.654
Doing things with her?

41:29.689 --> 41:32.023
How did you know there were others?

41:34.694 --> 41:36.194
I saw them.

41:39.115 --> 41:43.134
Daniel, you know what happened.

41:43.169 --> 41:47.455
She was pretty beat up down there.

41:47.506 --> 41:52.010
Wounds like that... A
young man has to be angry.

41:52.044 --> 41:55.380
Do you get angry a lot, Daniel?

41:55.382 --> 41:58.850
Lose your temper?

41:58.884 --> 42:01.886
You got in a fight with her, didn't you?

42:03.356 --> 42:05.523
I told you I don't remember.

42:08.644 --> 42:09.894
Look at these photos again.

42:09.896 --> 42:11.529
- I don't want to.
- Look at them.

42:11.564 --> 42:14.950
I gathered some flowers.

42:14.984 --> 42:16.534
You already said that.

42:16.569 --> 42:18.787
I want you to look at
that poor girl's neck.

42:18.821 --> 42:20.739
What does that look like to you?

42:20.741 --> 42:22.207
Somebody hurt her.

42:22.241 --> 42:23.675
You were with her.

42:23.709 --> 42:25.877
We got eyewitnesses, son.

42:25.911 --> 42:28.380
I-I was with her, but I left.

42:28.414 --> 42:30.315
Where'd you go?

42:30.349 --> 42:31.983
Wandering.

42:32.018 --> 42:36.671
Can anybody verify that?

42:36.722 --> 42:39.924
You said I could see my father.

42:39.926 --> 42:41.309
That you, honey?

42:41.344 --> 42:44.980
And you will.

42:45.014 --> 42:48.516
As soon as you come clean.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.518
Did you get what you needed at the store?

42:52.805 --> 42:55.824
I've been waiting for you.

42:55.858 --> 42:59.611
Unburden yourself, son.

42:59.613 --> 43:02.697
You put your hands around her neck.

43:04.367 --> 43:10.255
You squeezed... And squeezed...

43:12.041 --> 43:13.341
And squeezed.

43:19.675 --> 43:29.675
