WEBVTT

01:45.147 --> 01:46.398
How was week one?

01:47.733 --> 01:49.401
Motherfucker!

01:54.865 --> 01:55.866
Disorienting.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.996
You having second thoughts?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.292
Nothing but.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.711
Well, we're in the same boat.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.218
But I know
the place for Larry Hall is here.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.553
Never back out there.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.602
I've had you placed in Hall's unit.
Directly across from his cell.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.356
Everyone in that unit is medicated.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.693
I'm prescribing you an antidepressant.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.655
Otherwise, you'll arouse suspicion.

02:36.365 --> 02:37.866
There's nothing wrong with me.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.161
Hence, prison.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.584
Fine. I'll take the fucking pills.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.381
Otherwise, you keep your visits
to a minimum here.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.175
Too many drop-ins
will also arouse suspicion.

03:09.189 --> 03:13.902
<i>Most prisons grow predictable with time.</i>

03:18.657 --> 03:19.992
<i>They have a rhythm.</i>

03:27.249 --> 03:30.335
<i>Springfield's only rhythm
is unpredictability.</i>

03:39.136 --> 03:43.015
It'll wear on you. Affect your sleep.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.808
Your peace of mind.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.269
Is that what happened to the guy
who was in my cell before me?

03:52.941 --> 03:56.278
Previous inmate had
a predisposition to self-harm.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.324
Hey, hey! Come on, man!

04:00.407 --> 04:02.993
All right. That's all our time for today.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.623
Wait.

04:08.457 --> 04:12.419
If things go completely south someday,
how do I reach you or the warden?

04:12.503 --> 04:14.421
You just demand to speak to me.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.173
Guards don't like demands much.

04:22.721 --> 04:23.889
How's your memory?

04:24.806 --> 04:25.807
Top-notch.

04:26.517 --> 04:30.103
612-5711.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.358
That's my home number.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.528
You could only know that
if I gave it to you.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.240
That should be enough to convince
any guard to reach out to me.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.744
612-5711.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.457
612-5711.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.544
612-5711.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.756
Here you go. Open.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.592
Next.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.053
Keep it moving.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.223
Awesome.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.141
Open.

05:10.978 --> 05:11.979
Next up.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.524
How you doing?

05:15.607 --> 05:16.650
Open.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.363
- Open.
- What pills they give you?

05:24.366 --> 05:25.534
Come on.

05:27.911 --> 05:28.996
Open.

05:29.872 --> 05:30.956
Good chatting.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.249
Let's go, inmate.

05:44.970 --> 05:45.971
Open.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.647
Open.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.571
Who's this guy you got in with Hall?

06:05.574 --> 06:09.328
Jimmy Keene.
Drug dealer, good talker. People like him.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.539
Why not use an undercover?
Someone with experience?

06:12.623 --> 06:13.874
Hall would smell him out.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.503
So, what if something happens
on the inside?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.465
Shit happens
to people in prison all the time.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.760
If Keene didn't know that when
he started dealing coke to half of Cicero,

06:24.843 --> 06:26.220
fuck him, he should have.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.473
I'm going through every phone call
made from the Hall house

06:29.556 --> 06:31.183
for a decade leading up to his arrest.

06:31.266 --> 06:36.230
Then, I'd like to run all unsolved murders
in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Missouri

06:36.313 --> 06:38.607
against his days off from janitorial work.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.150
- That all?
- Nope.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.818
Then, I wanna run
all missing persons reports

06:41.902 --> 06:43.237
in that same time period

06:43.320 --> 06:46.323
against Civil War
and Revolutionary War reenactments.

06:46.406 --> 06:50.035
We did that in '94.
Pretty much did all this before.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.745
I guess we're doing it again.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.002
I did look over
the Jessica Roach file last night.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.756
There was nothing, but--
Looked over the Reitler file.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.300
Do you know what the Marion PD did

07:06.134 --> 07:09.346
the night before I took Larry into custody
and drove him back to Illinois?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.430
No.

07:11.014 --> 07:15.269
They drove him out to the country
looking for Reitler's body all over again.

07:16.144 --> 07:21.525
All that shit Marion talked about
Larry wasting their time the first time.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.028
Turns out they just up and let him
do it to 'em again.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.531
- And didn't find shit?
- No. Not a thing.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.035
Next morning,
I drive Larry back to Illinois,

07:32.119 --> 07:36.456
but he's not the same guy as he was
the day before. Then, he was…

07:36.540 --> 07:39.793
I don't know, small and meek. Sad.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.171
But that morning, his eyes were bright.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.549
<i>His dick could have
drilled hole in granite.</i>

07:46.216 --> 07:47.342
He was somebody.

07:47.426 --> 07:50.554
The Marion PD told him
he was a person of interest.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.559
Wabash PD said
that he was a possible serial killer.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.855
It was the last time
Larry ever talked to me

07:59.938 --> 08:01.940
about the night he killed Jessica Roach.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.693
Just sang his ass off.

08:04.776 --> 08:05.777
<i>New England's shore</i>

08:05.861 --> 08:07.905
<i>We leave the plows and workshops</i>

08:07.988 --> 08:10.824
<i>Our wives and children dear
With hearts too full for…</i>

08:10.908 --> 08:14.286
But he never said another word
about the killings. Ever.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.537
Orange chair squeaks.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.833
Course it does.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.635
Does your mother know
how to change the oil?

08:29.718 --> 08:30.928
It's not very hard.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.806
My mother's not gonna
change the oil, Larry. She's almost blind.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.975
Could she get someone to help?

08:37.058 --> 08:39.811
It doesn't--
Why are we talking about this?

08:39.895 --> 08:42.105
Well, it does matter.
It's your car, it matters.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.191
Stop. All right? Okay.
Please, just fucking stop!

08:44.274 --> 08:46.068
Okay, if she can't change the oil,

08:46.151 --> 08:49.238
then can she at least
siphon the gas via the fuel tank?

08:49.321 --> 08:50.864
- She's gotta have a hose--
- Stop!

08:51.657 --> 08:54.159
Well, you don't want the gas
to corrode the tank.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.707
The gas could corrode the tank.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.673
Gas could corrode the tank.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.509
Hey.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.224
He seemed pretty upset.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.605
I'm Jimmy, by the way.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.236
Jimmy.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.283
Fellas. No contact.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.620
Right. Sorry.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.081
You should be in bed.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.584
No. Bed's no good for me.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.547
I need to keep my mind,
you know, active.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.634
How'd you get in? It's not visiting day.

10:34.218 --> 10:38.514
The fellas here, they gave me a pass.
I just showed 'em my badge. You know?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.433
Dad, Jesus Christ.

10:41.517 --> 10:44.478
These boys,
they're gonna watch out for you.

10:44.561 --> 10:48.982
It's no different than--

10:49.066 --> 10:54.863
Whether inside, outside.
Blue is blue. It's a brotherhood.

10:56.615 --> 11:01.662
I'm not supposed to have a family.
You just outed me as a cop's kid.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.832
<i>Go ahead.</i>

11:08.418 --> 11:12.214
Jesus. Fuck.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.010
I--

11:18.262 --> 11:19.263
God.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.765
I forgot.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.560
- It's okay.
- It's just-- No, it's not.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.397
It's not okay. It's like--

11:28.480 --> 11:32.609
It's my… my mind.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.573
The parts. They're not connecting.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.118
I fucked you up. I fucked up.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.619
It'll be fine.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.704
No.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.455
It won't.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.125
It won't.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.796
Dad, look at me.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.215
Dad.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.634
Dad, look at me.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.721
All I ever do…

12:02.181 --> 12:03.432
is fuck you up.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.519
Hey. You were right.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.522
This place is scary.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.026
Fucking terrifying.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.822
And I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to pull off

12:18.906 --> 12:20.032
what they asked me to.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.327
I get scared.

12:26.205 --> 12:31.293
But then I think, "Nut up, pussy.
You're Big Jim Keene's son."

12:31.376 --> 12:32.669
Fuck off.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.421
When I was a kid,

12:35.589 --> 12:38.550
you'd walk through the door
still in your uni half the time.

12:40.093 --> 12:45.057
You were so fucking big. Strong.

12:48.310 --> 12:51.730
You'd been out there all day,
risking your life, not taking any shit.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.150
And I'd think…

12:57.903 --> 12:59.530
"I'm gonna be that guy someday."

13:02.199 --> 13:03.450
It's "someday," Dad.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.955
Sammy and I, we're gonna stick around.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.919
I found a motel that rents by the week.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.546
Dad, no.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.967
I'm sticking around.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.885
I've gotta be around.

13:23.846 --> 13:24.847
Okay.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.475
But Dad, next time,

13:28.559 --> 13:30.894
respect the normal visiting hours.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.939
Okay, Jimmy. Time to go.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.338
You mind keeping this to yourself?

13:58.922 --> 14:00.382
Your old man being a cop?

14:00.465 --> 14:01.550
Ex-cop.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.347
A lot of guys in here are cops' kids.
Both sides of the bars.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.557
Don't sweat it.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.852
Hell, who'd listen to me anyways, right?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.396
Thanks.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.647
No problem.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.327
There's an old-timer who's been
asking about you on the yard.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.038
You ever hear of
Vincent "The Chin" Gigante?

14:32.664 --> 14:33.874
Mob guy?

14:35.125 --> 14:38.921
Used to walk around Little Italy
acting all nutty? That guy?

14:39.004 --> 14:41.215
It was Greenwich Village, but yeah.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.010
Gotta admit, it was an inspired move.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.762
Took the Feds years more to get him.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.805
So, this is the old-timer?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.600
Introduce yourself. Drop my name.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.644
He's about the best guy
you can know in here.

14:54.937 --> 14:55.938
Thanks.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.609
My old man did this job 20 years.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.694
He used to say,

15:02.778 --> 15:06.323
"What makes it hard time is
people giving each other a hard time.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.950
Doesn't have to be like that."

15:09.910 --> 15:11.245
I'm with the old man.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.754
"On March 27, 1993,

15:20.838 --> 15:22.923
16-year-old Rayna Rison disappeared

15:23.006 --> 15:25.551
after leaving her job
at a veterinary hospital

15:25.634 --> 15:27.010
in La Porte, Indiana."

15:29.471 --> 15:32.558
Well, that's three days before
Tricia Reitler was killed in Marion.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.144
"Rayna Rison's body was
fished out of pond two months later."

15:37.855 --> 15:39.523
Cause of death strangulation?

15:41.692 --> 15:44.194
"The local PD focused
on Rison's former brother-in-law."

15:45.028 --> 15:47.823
But the DA eventually dropped
all charges for lack of evidence.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.783
Why'd they like the brother-in-law?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.452
He'd been convicted
of molesting Rayna when she was 12.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.001
And what's this have to do with Hall?

15:59.084 --> 16:02.129
"A bottle of Rayna Rison's
birth control pills were found

16:02.212 --> 16:03.839
in Larry Hall's van."

16:03.922 --> 16:05.382
A bottle?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.177
That's what's written here.
They meant case, obviously.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.345
Keep yours in a case?

16:11.054 --> 16:12.514
Yeah. What do you keep yours in?

16:13.182 --> 16:14.766
I practice the rhythm method.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.061
"Hall was pulled over near Marion
in his dirty van."

16:18.145 --> 16:19.396
Not his clean one.

16:20.314 --> 16:21.356
No shit?

16:21.440 --> 16:23.442
"Found in the van were
birth control pills…

16:25.527 --> 16:30.490
a hunting knife, coils of rope,
a ski mask, gloves,

16:31.658 --> 16:35.329
and a 'Please Pray' missing persons
poster for Tricia Reitler."

16:37.623 --> 16:39.416
Where did all this evidence end up?

16:40.209 --> 16:42.836
Nowhere. Hall was cited
for a misdemeanor and let go.

16:45.339 --> 16:47.508
- Wait. When did he confess?
- That afternoon.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.676
They kept him on a 12-hour hold
and then kicked him loose.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.929
They deemed him a "serial confessor."

16:54.139 --> 16:55.307
What a talent.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.310
You make people believe
you aren't the killer

16:58.393 --> 17:00.395
even after you say you fucking did it.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.194
- Check.
- Check up.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.199
Watch it.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.662
There it is.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.454
You're Italian, right?

17:20.082 --> 17:21.083
Yeah.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.544
How Italian?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.045
Three-quarters.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.716
So, you'll know boccie?

17:31.468 --> 17:33.887
Yeah. I used to play
with one of my grandfathers

17:33.971 --> 17:35.055
when I was a kid.

17:35.556 --> 17:36.557
Which one?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.309
The Irish one.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.273
- You getting fresh with me?
- Yeah.

17:46.567 --> 17:47.693
You know who I am?

17:47.776 --> 17:48.777
I do.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.113
Don't get fresh with me.

17:51.822 --> 17:52.823
Okay.

17:56.243 --> 18:00.831
Well, a lot of guys, they'd run over
their own dog to play boccie with me.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.919
None of those guys know
I got the bursitis in my fucking shoulder.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.798
Now you know I got the bursitis
in my fucking shoulder.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.635
So anyone else uses
the word "bursitis" around me,

18:13.719 --> 18:15.596
I'm gonna know you opened your mouth.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.849
Then, I'm gonna have to
cut your tongue out

18:18.932 --> 18:20.350
and sew your lips shut.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.353
Or some fucking thing.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.772
You follow?

18:28.066 --> 18:29.151
Yes, Mr. Gigante.

18:31.653 --> 18:36.074
Now, you're gonna play with me.
You're gonna make all the long throws.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.661
My shoulder won't prevent me
from making precision shots.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.164
So nobody should notice shit.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.585
Sounds like a plan, Mr. Gigante.

18:48.712 --> 18:49.922
I know it's a plan.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.007
I fucking planned it.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.429
But I like you, kid.

18:58.472 --> 18:59.640
You got manners.

19:00.682 --> 19:01.683
I like that.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.063
So don't fuck up.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.941
Then you're gonna do pleasant time.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.401
Sounds good, Mr. Gigante.

19:17.199 --> 19:21.411
Now, show me
what your grandfather taught you.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.712
Where's your non-Irish grandfather from?

19:31.630 --> 19:33.507
San Giovanni a Teducci.

19:34.925 --> 19:39.930
Get the fuck out of here.
My parents were from the Marianella.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.057
It's right next door.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.103
What's the matter with you?
You don't know Italy?

19:46.186 --> 19:48.021
- Not really.
- How come?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.607
Grew up in Wisconsin.

19:51.817 --> 19:52.943
Jesus.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.488
That's almost as bad as the Irish part.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.848
Hey, can I ask you something?

20:25.893 --> 20:28.770
Do you not like me or something, man?

20:29.771 --> 20:31.481
Is that what you were going to ask me?

20:32.065 --> 20:35.068
No. I was gonna ask you,
what do you do around here for fun?

20:45.495 --> 20:46.830
Is anyone sitting here?

20:46.914 --> 20:47.915
Hey.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.422
What you watching, fellas?

20:56.798 --> 20:58.383
Our show.

21:02.679 --> 21:03.889
<i>Welcome back to Houston.</i>

21:09.811 --> 21:12.439
<i>But three years ago,
a woman living in this house</i>

21:12.523 --> 21:16.193
<i>walked into her garage
to find a murderer waiting.</i>

21:29.957 --> 21:31.041
<i>You're gonna rank in the top 20.</i>

21:37.881 --> 21:39.258
We were watching that.

21:39.842 --> 21:41.301
Yeah, now you're fucking not.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.266
<i>The only way
we're gonna find out about that is</i>

21:47.349 --> 21:52.437
<i>after we play 11 bone-crushing,
bloody, well-executed games.</i>

21:52.521 --> 21:55.607
<i>Until then, I don't give a damn
about the rankings.</i>

21:55.691 --> 21:58.402
<i>And there better not be
anybody on this team</i>

21:58.485 --> 21:59.611
<i>who feels any differently!</i>

21:59.695 --> 22:01.864
<i>Or I'll kick their ass! Kick their--</i>

22:03.866 --> 22:06.118
<i>But in 1987, Houston police say…</i>

22:06.201 --> 22:07.870
You wanna change that back.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.249
No. I don't.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.294
Right fucking now.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.385
Calm down. What-- Come on, now.

22:26.847 --> 22:29.558
Do I look like
a fucking remote control to you?

22:30.517 --> 22:34.521
Cry! Motherfucker,
do I look like a fucking remote con--

22:34.605 --> 22:36.607
Get him out of here!

22:36.690 --> 22:40.027
Let me go! All right!

22:40.110 --> 22:42.779
Medical response team
up here in the TV room.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.698
We got a prisoner altercation.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.283
They let you out?

23:29.034 --> 23:30.327
After a night. Yeah.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.088
Why'd you stick up for us?

23:43.257 --> 23:44.925
I wasn't sticking up for you.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.183
Jimmy.

24:01.233 --> 24:02.526
Larry.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.410
Hey, why'd that guy get so upset
the other day?

24:12.661 --> 24:15.122
The one you were talking to
about his car or something?

24:15.414 --> 24:17.708
Percy. He's excitable.

24:18.792 --> 24:22.963
I was telling him to tell someone
on the outside to take care of his car.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.341
So, why'd he get pissed?

24:27.384 --> 24:31.430
Well, Percy thinks that
he's never gonna see his car again.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.018
Because he's serving life.

24:39.563 --> 24:42.524
What, what do you drive?

24:43.692 --> 24:44.818
On the outside?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.447
'67 Camaro SS.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.536
Matte black with Cragars
and fat-ass 60s on it.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.581
I like vans.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.298
Yeah?

25:07.382 --> 25:08.926
You trick 'em out?

25:09.009 --> 25:12.054
Get captain's chairs in there,
some carpet or…

25:18.977 --> 25:21.396
It's unhealthy to think like Percy.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.776
There's always hope.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.033
You got a second, Jimmy?

25:33.617 --> 25:34.618
Yeah.

25:36.203 --> 25:37.663
Hey, nice meeting you, Larry.

25:52.386 --> 25:53.470
Temper, temper.

25:55.514 --> 25:57.808
Fight one asshole early
or all of 'em later.

25:58.809 --> 26:00.227
Sound philosophy.

26:00.853 --> 26:04.064
Hey,
I heard The Chin took a shining to ya.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.733
Guys like that…

26:07.651 --> 26:11.405
They make time go easy…
as long as you're one of them.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.408
You one of them, Jimmy?

26:16.034 --> 26:18.620
Am I connected? No. No.

26:19.121 --> 26:21.331
No. Yeah, I know that.

26:22.457 --> 26:26.879
What I mean is,
are you someone he can put his trust in?

26:27.921 --> 26:29.631
He'll take care of you if you are.

26:31.383 --> 26:32.885
Cut your throat if you're not.

26:35.262 --> 26:36.638
Just open it wide.

26:38.265 --> 26:39.349
What's your point?

26:39.433 --> 26:43.103
Your old man,
he must have been a hell of a cop.

26:43.979 --> 26:47.608
Took him all of a minute and a half
in here to blow your cover.

26:50.152 --> 26:51.361
You see,

26:51.445 --> 26:57.701
the only reason someone comes into a place
like this under an assumed identity…

27:00.621 --> 27:02.372
is because they're a snitch.

27:04.082 --> 27:07.002
Now, who you're here to snitch on,
that doesn't matter.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.713
That you're here to snitch
is the only concern.

27:10.214 --> 27:15.511
So, you're either Jimmy the gunrunner
from Wisconsin,

27:16.845 --> 27:20.349
or you're Jimmy the drug-dealing cop's kid
from Chicago.

27:20.849 --> 27:23.727
Now, if you're the first Jimmy,
no problem.

27:24.895 --> 27:28.982
But if it gets out that you're the second
Jimmy pretending to be the first Jimmy…

27:32.986 --> 27:36.156
That's going to be a very unfortunate day
for both fucking Jimmys.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.533
What do you want?

27:37.616 --> 27:39.618
Dude, I wanna help you.

27:39.701 --> 27:44.081
I wanna make sure everyone continues
to know you as Jimmy the gunrunner.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.793
- But…
- I need your help for that.

27:49.211 --> 27:52.047
I mean, can't keep doing
all the good in this relationship

27:52.130 --> 27:53.966
without getting a little something back.

27:54.049 --> 27:58.011
Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't want you
to feel taken advantage of.

28:01.723 --> 28:02.724
Jimmy.

28:07.271 --> 28:08.564
Jimmy.

28:12.484 --> 28:15.571
Let's not go confusing me
with someone you can disrespect.

28:17.239 --> 28:18.574
I read up on you.

28:19.241 --> 28:22.286
You were a big player in Chicago.
Lived large.

28:22.911 --> 28:27.291
So I need a small loan. And I'm good
for it. And it ain't much. Not to you.

28:27.374 --> 28:31.128
But to me, in my present circumstances,
it's a lot. And I need it fast.

28:31.837 --> 28:33.005
- How much?
- 10,000.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.424
How am I supposed to come up
with ten grand in here?

28:36.091 --> 28:37.426
Talk to your daddy.

28:37.509 --> 28:41.388
I never met a drug dealer yet who didn't
have rainy-day cash tucked away somewhere.

28:41.471 --> 28:45.809
You tell your old man to get me my 10,000.
Like, yesterday.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.856
I'll need to reach out to him.

28:51.565 --> 28:52.733
I already did.

28:54.151 --> 28:55.485
He'll be here tomorrow.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.238
Noon sharp.

29:00.908 --> 29:05.245
And be nicer to him this time, Jimmy.

29:06.288 --> 29:07.497
He's your father.

29:07.998 --> 29:10.501
Last time you really took the wind
out of the poor guy.

29:11.543 --> 29:12.544
Carter.

29:15.672 --> 29:17.508
Put a "Mr." before that.

29:18.926 --> 29:20.719
- Mr. Carter.
- Yeah?

29:23.388 --> 29:25.182
What if I can't lay my hands on it?

29:25.974 --> 29:27.476
Then what good are your hands?

29:39.196 --> 29:40.864
Fuck.

30:06.014 --> 30:07.391
Mind if I come in?

30:23.365 --> 30:24.533
Is this you?

30:26.577 --> 30:27.661
Yeah.

30:28.996 --> 30:30.247
Where's this from?

30:30.330 --> 30:32.165
That's a reenactment.

30:33.250 --> 30:37.212
A bunch of us would get together
and reenact famous Civil War battles.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.549
Those mutton chops?

30:41.258 --> 30:47.181
Burnsides.
Generals wore them, back then.

30:48.891 --> 30:52.311
That guy right next to me?
That's my brother, Gary.

30:52.394 --> 30:55.355
- We're identical twins.
- Really?

30:56.690 --> 30:57.858
He looks bigger.

30:59.401 --> 31:02.613
He fed on me
when we were in my mother's belly.

31:03.655 --> 31:09.286
He got all my nutrients and whatnot
and grew big and strong…

31:11.371 --> 31:15.000
and I kind of withered, I guess.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.084
What?

31:17.878 --> 31:19.171
You look fine to me.

31:21.507 --> 31:23.467
Lights out in five, ladies.

31:28.639 --> 31:32.684
Why are you being nice to me?

31:35.062 --> 31:37.397
I don't know how anyone does time
in a place like this

31:37.481 --> 31:39.233
without a friend to talk to.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.736
And we're right across
from each other, so…

31:45.656 --> 31:46.740
Night, Larry.

31:51.036 --> 31:54.164
That bag that you gave me when they
were gonna raid the Gold Coast house?

31:54.248 --> 31:55.249
Yes.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.460
It's gone, Jimmy.

31:58.544 --> 32:02.673
I-- We-- I mean, we gotta eat.

32:02.756 --> 32:04.883
There was 80 grand in that bag.

32:04.967 --> 32:06.593
It was more like 70.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.638
And two keys of blow.
What happened to that?

32:10.430 --> 32:12.182
I gave them to Danny to sell.

32:12.266 --> 32:16.228
He said he got jacked up
by some Nicaraguans or Ecuadorians,

32:16.311 --> 32:17.521
one of those two.

32:18.397 --> 32:20.148
Danny can't be trusted, Dad. Okay?

32:21.191 --> 32:24.736
- Since when?
- Since the fucking crib.

32:26.405 --> 32:27.406
Okay.

32:29.741 --> 32:32.870
- There's a shoebox in the laundry--
- In the laundry room, yeah.

32:34.162 --> 32:35.163
Yeah.

32:36.540 --> 32:37.833
Jimmy, I mean…

32:38.333 --> 32:43.547
I got medical bills, the businesses,
the house. It all adds up.

32:43.630 --> 32:47.217
Dad, if I don't come up with ten grand…

32:50.179 --> 32:51.305
I'm dead.

32:52.306 --> 32:53.932
All right. What do we do?

32:55.434 --> 33:00.856
At the Kankakee house, in the basement,
there's a center-wall speaker for the TV.

33:00.939 --> 33:02.733
They tore that house apart.

33:02.816 --> 33:06.278
I watched them.
They never touched those speakers.

33:07.029 --> 33:09.907
In the center speaker,
there's about a kilo in there.

33:11.658 --> 33:13.243
You can get it to me, I'll…

33:15.120 --> 33:17.122
figure out a way to move it in here.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.091
All right, I'm on it.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.303
You know I wouldn't ask you
to do this if--

33:31.386 --> 33:33.680
I'm not gonna let you down.

33:44.149 --> 33:45.817
<i>We left you a few messages.</i>

33:46.401 --> 33:47.736
Which I planned to return.

33:47.819 --> 33:50.113
You wanna discuss Rayna Rison?

33:50.197 --> 33:51.198
Yes.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.742
The prime suspect walked.

33:54.868 --> 33:55.869
Why?

33:56.537 --> 33:59.414
Truth? We never had much on him.

33:59.498 --> 34:01.750
But most folks who worked the case
were sure he did it.

34:01.834 --> 34:04.419
- You?
- At the time? Yeah.

34:06.004 --> 34:07.923
Now, I've come to thinking it was a--

34:08.005 --> 34:11.885
a boy she was seeing two,
three years back.

34:13.178 --> 34:15.889
He up and did a pointless, horrible thing.

34:17.266 --> 34:19.976
And got away with it for now.

34:20.476 --> 34:24.147
Do you remember the name "Larry Hall"
in connection to the case?

34:26.942 --> 34:28.068
I ruled Hall out.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.612
- But he confessed to it.
- He did.

34:32.614 --> 34:36.534
You found evidence in Hall's van
connecting him to Rison.

34:39.663 --> 34:41.706
Birth control pills with Rison's name?

34:41.790 --> 34:43.792
A bottle of birth control pills.

34:45.043 --> 34:48.045
Keep your birth control pills in a bottle,
Agent McCauley?

34:49.339 --> 34:52.676
I presumed someone meant to write "pack,"
or "case."

34:52.759 --> 34:56.889
No. It was a bottle
with a dubious-looking label on it. Here.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.311
I checked every pharmacy for 75 miles.

35:03.145 --> 35:07.649
Couldn't find a prescription for
birth control medication in Rison's name.

35:08.692 --> 35:10.944
Then, we checked her blood.

35:11.570 --> 35:17.618
Found trace amounts of Accutane,
some acetaminophen, some THC.

35:17.701 --> 35:21.205
But no progestin or anything found
in birth control medication.

35:21.288 --> 35:23.248
But when you questioned Hall?

35:23.332 --> 35:26.418
He confessed. He told a great story.

35:27.586 --> 35:29.046
He was convincing enough that I thought,

35:29.129 --> 35:33.800
"Shit, what if this wack job told
the same story

35:33.884 --> 35:36.094
to a gullible reporter or cop?"

35:36.595 --> 35:40.140
I thought,
"Shit, I better cover my ass here."

35:41.016 --> 35:45.771
You look into the whereabouts
of Hall the night Rison was killed?

35:46.563 --> 35:48.023
Haven't locked them down yet.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.526
I did.

35:50.609 --> 35:53.987
He was at a Civil War reenactment in Ohio.
Few hundred miles away.

35:55.155 --> 35:58.158
Found witnesses, even a picture.

35:58.992 --> 36:01.537
I have a picture of Hall
and the witnesses.

36:02.120 --> 36:07.417
Because I manned 600 miles
in over 100 hours working on Hall.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.462
I had to sit in front of
a budget committee six months later

36:10.546 --> 36:14.633
and explain why I wasted taxpayer money
in a cratered economy

36:14.716 --> 36:18.095
to ascertain the innocence
of a serial confessor.

36:19.513 --> 36:20.764
So, that was fun.

36:21.682 --> 36:23.892
Larry Hall planted fake evidence
on himself

36:23.976 --> 36:26.395
for a crime no one was looking at him for.

36:27.479 --> 36:31.024
Ask yourselves,
what kind of human being does that?

36:40.117 --> 36:41.785
Real arrowheads?

36:42.619 --> 36:45.581
They were all over the woods
behind my parents' house.

36:46.790 --> 36:51.920
So, some Indian,
like, a hundred years ago,

36:52.004 --> 36:53.755
shot at some deer and missed,

36:53.839 --> 36:56.383
and you found his arrowhead
in the pine needles?

36:56.466 --> 37:00.179
Well, it's more like
150 or 160 years earlier.

37:01.346 --> 37:04.683
The Miami were wiped out in 1812
at the Battle of Mississinewa.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.269
How do you know all this shit?

37:08.437 --> 37:12.357
The-- I--
Well, I'm part Miami on my father's side.

37:14.318 --> 37:16.570
Yeah, I'm part Fort Lauderdale
on my mother's.

37:23.327 --> 37:25.704
So, you found some arrowheads?

37:28.165 --> 37:30.250
And small coins.

37:31.835 --> 37:36.965
The base of a lamp.
Had to be about 100 years old.

37:40.469 --> 37:46.016
Unless you're in, like, New York City
or Chicago, the world is fields.

37:46.767 --> 37:49.353
They're everywhere. Behind everything.

37:51.897 --> 37:55.859
Next time you're in a plane,
you ought to look down.

37:56.777 --> 38:00.864
It's just patches and patches
of open land.

38:04.535 --> 38:08.330
And all those fields,
they got things under 'em.

38:09.623 --> 38:13.460
History. Just gotta dig it up.

38:16.255 --> 38:20.092
I miss the smell of fields in winter.

38:20.175 --> 38:21.718
It's kind of metallic.

38:22.970 --> 38:25.514
Yeah, I miss October, November smells.

38:26.098 --> 38:30.519
Trees. Wet piles of leaves.

38:31.186 --> 38:35.816
Can be hard sometimes to pass a field
around Halloween, you know?

38:39.611 --> 38:42.698
Friday nights? Football.

38:44.366 --> 38:45.367
Th--

38:47.452 --> 38:48.787
Because you played

38:50.581 --> 38:51.915
Yeah, that was the only…

38:53.917 --> 38:55.210
I don't know.

38:57.921 --> 38:59.339
Lie I ever loved.

39:01.133 --> 39:02.968
Why was it a lie?

39:04.511 --> 39:06.346
That life would always be that good.

39:08.265 --> 39:09.641
I'd get the girl.

39:10.267 --> 39:12.269
We'd go off
into our happy ending together,

39:12.352 --> 39:15.147
and she'd love me forever.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.819
What was her name, the girl? What girl?

39:22.196 --> 39:26.700
I don't know. I never met her.
I just thought that was the deal.

39:27.409 --> 39:31.997
You did something really well,
that girls really liked to watch you do…

39:33.999 --> 39:35.792
and then the girl showed up.

39:38.504 --> 39:40.714
And you were rewarded with her for life.

39:49.306 --> 39:51.266
What can I say? I peaked in high school.

39:53.060 --> 39:55.354
Well, at least you had high school.

39:57.064 --> 39:59.441
Pretty sure I peaked in the womb.

40:08.617 --> 40:09.993
What happened, Mr. Carter?

40:10.077 --> 40:12.371
Last night's hockey got a little intense.

40:12.454 --> 40:14.623
Which is why
you should stop playing hockey.

40:14.873 --> 40:17.167
Come on, Larry.
You got your two o'clock.

40:21.004 --> 40:22.965
Would you leave a bookmark in there?

40:23.048 --> 40:24.466
- Yeah, sure, man.
- Thank you.

40:36.979 --> 40:40.691
They cracked my cheekbone
so I could still work. Where's my money?

40:40.774 --> 40:43.527
Won't be money. It'll be product,
and I'll need to move it.

40:44.945 --> 40:46.738
How are you gonna do that, Jimmy?

40:46.822 --> 40:50.242
If I can get it in, I can move it fast.
Get you your ten grand in a day.

40:50.325 --> 40:52.411
And the Latin Kings? Black Guerrillas?

40:52.494 --> 40:54.997
The ones who will shank you
before you sell your second gram?

40:55.080 --> 40:57.332
That's who I'll sell to.
I'm not trying to deal grams.

40:57.416 --> 41:02.171
I'm trying to unload a single kilo
to a single buyer at a hell of a discount.

41:03.797 --> 41:05.174
When will it get here?

41:07.551 --> 41:08.677
Hopefully, tomorrow.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.306
No more fuckups.
No more changes to the plan.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.102
His name is Jimmy?

41:19.730 --> 41:21.857
He didn't know what reenactments are,

41:21.940 --> 41:23.275
so I've been tellin' him.

41:24.693 --> 41:25.861
What's he like?

41:26.737 --> 41:27.946
He's big.

41:28.530 --> 41:31.575
He was a football player in high school.

41:32.284 --> 41:35.245
That type, you know?

41:35.954 --> 41:37.039
He's…

41:41.293 --> 41:42.503
What?

41:43.212 --> 41:45.422
He's easy to talk to.

41:47.925 --> 41:50.135
What about him
makes him so easy to talk to?

41:54.890 --> 41:57.768
He looks at me, not through me.

41:59.937 --> 42:01.688
And he's very funny.

42:04.608 --> 42:06.109
That sounds positive.

42:08.111 --> 42:09.613
Like you're making a friend.

42:14.952 --> 42:17.788
What kind of guy
plants false evidence on himself

42:17.871 --> 42:20.582
for a crime
no one's even looking at him for?

42:28.006 --> 42:29.424
Next round is up.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.220
Thanks.

42:39.142 --> 42:40.561
Brian, what kind of guy?

42:42.604 --> 42:44.690
Supremely fucked up human being.

42:44.773 --> 42:46.233
- But could that mean he--
- No.

42:47.192 --> 42:49.570
Okay? Larry lies. No shit, he lies.

42:49.653 --> 42:52.281
He lies. He steals. He hoards.

42:52.364 --> 42:55.200
And he kills girls. Lots of them.

42:58.871 --> 43:01.415
His own brother
calls him a serial confessor.

43:01.498 --> 43:03.333
Marion PD says it.

43:04.251 --> 43:07.045
Drysdale too. And he is, okay? He is.

43:07.129 --> 43:10.924
But he's also a serial killer
and one doesn't cancel out the other.

43:11.008 --> 43:13.260
We've been going back
through all these cases.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.096
We haven't found anything
that pins them on Hall.

43:17.264 --> 43:21.643
Because he's a janitor who drives around
in a van filled with chemical solvents.

43:22.686 --> 43:24.521
And he spent his formative years
digging graves.

43:24.605 --> 43:26.607
- So, when Larry Hall kills someone--
- Does he?

43:26.690 --> 43:30.444
When Larry kills someone,
he leaves no trace of himself behind,

43:30.527 --> 43:34.740
and he buries those bodies
so deep in forests

43:34.823 --> 43:39.161
and farmlands and underneath
factory skeletons where nobody ever goes,

43:39.244 --> 43:40.412
so we can't find them.

43:48.587 --> 43:50.631
Larry's very good at this.

43:55.969 --> 43:57.638
Or he just likes telling stories.

44:11.235 --> 44:12.945
It okay to be down here?

44:13.445 --> 44:15.280
I keep an eye on the boiler.

44:15.781 --> 44:17.699
I was a janitor back home.

44:18.867 --> 44:20.035
Well, what about me?

44:21.995 --> 44:23.121
You're with me.

44:23.747 --> 44:24.748
All right.

44:38.053 --> 44:40.722
Why are you here? In Springfield, I mean.

44:43.016 --> 44:47.187
Selling guns without a license
and displaying antisocial tendencies.

44:53.443 --> 44:57.739
Well, this is my office.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.408
Have a seat.

45:01.159 --> 45:03.245
You're a big dog in this place.

45:04.162 --> 45:09.835
In jails I just clean up spills
and fix things. That's hardly important.

45:14.214 --> 45:16.800
So, what's the worst mess
you ever had to deal with?

45:20.596 --> 45:22.890
The worst mess I've--

45:27.311 --> 45:29.271
There was this factory floor once.

45:30.647 --> 45:33.984
Something died,
maybe a possum or something.

45:34.067 --> 45:35.944
And then the rats got to it,

45:36.028 --> 45:41.325
so there was all these hard, furry bits
all over the floor. Really gross.

45:41.909 --> 45:47.206
Someone, some idiot, decided to
mop over it, and then they gave up.

45:47.289 --> 45:48.624
So, there was, like…

45:50.209 --> 45:52.085
The whole mess was, like…

45:53.962 --> 45:55.631
like, laminated, you know?

45:57.466 --> 45:58.842
So, what'd you do?

45:58.926 --> 46:00.636
I got out the big guns.

46:00.719 --> 46:03.055
Industrial floor strippers.

46:03.138 --> 46:06.767
I'm talking sodium hydroxide,
maybe 5% to 10%.

46:06.850 --> 46:10.270
Monoethanolamine. Ethyl alcohol.
Super toxic.

46:10.354 --> 46:14.107
I tried to work some grit in,
like sand, you know?

46:14.650 --> 46:17.986
You need that
to break up the crunchy stuff.

46:18.070 --> 46:20.030
You know what the secret ingredient is?

46:21.323 --> 46:22.324
Urine.

46:23.825 --> 46:26.453
I just piss in the bucket.
Always seemed to do the trick.

46:28.038 --> 46:29.414
Bodily fluids, they all--

46:29.915 --> 46:33.836
They all serve, like,
a different function, every one of them.

46:33.919 --> 46:38.715
Like, saliva has one purpose
and blood another.

46:40.175 --> 46:42.761
And sweat and semen. Earwax.

46:42.845 --> 46:44.012
Is earwax a fluid?

46:45.806 --> 46:48.725
I don't know. I feel like it should be.

46:51.645 --> 46:54.731
- We'll call it one. What the hell.
- What the hell.

46:59.069 --> 47:00.821
- My brother, he--
- Gary.

47:02.531 --> 47:03.532
Gary, yeah.

47:07.703 --> 47:11.456
Gary says that sometimes they're wet.

47:18.422 --> 47:19.464
What's wet?

47:22.593 --> 47:23.760
You know.

47:31.059 --> 47:33.228
You mean pussy?

47:33.312 --> 47:34.354
Yes!

47:34.855 --> 47:37.107
Yes. Yeah.

47:40.110 --> 47:41.695
You never had a wet one before?

47:41.778 --> 47:42.821
I've-- No.

47:47.409 --> 47:48.911
I think you're making it up.

47:51.246 --> 47:52.289
Gary too?

47:54.791 --> 47:56.126
So, the women you've been with…

47:58.545 --> 48:00.589
They're dry as pine bark.

48:01.423 --> 48:03.425
It's all scratchy, you know?

48:09.848 --> 48:11.725
So, how do you penetrate, then?

48:13.894 --> 48:14.895
Penetrate?

48:15.938 --> 48:16.939
Yeah.

48:19.316 --> 48:20.567
I just kind of…

48:26.990 --> 48:28.325
Just kind of jam it in.

48:31.787 --> 48:32.996
They're okay with that?

48:33.705 --> 48:36.708
I don't care. The girl? I don't care.

48:38.585 --> 48:40.003
Do you?

48:41.213 --> 48:43.757
Do you care
what the girls think of you after?

48:46.176 --> 48:47.261
Only once.

48:47.845 --> 48:49.263
She was…

48:50.681 --> 48:53.433
She didn't like
the way things were going down too much.

48:56.144 --> 48:58.939
Was she wet?

49:00.190 --> 49:01.567
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Was she w--

49:02.359 --> 49:04.278
Yeah, I don't believe you, but go on.

49:04.987 --> 49:06.989
Anyway. We were--

49:08.240 --> 49:09.408
I was younger,

49:09.908 --> 49:12.828
and we were at her parents' house.

49:13.495 --> 49:14.913
And she was gonna scream.

49:16.456 --> 49:20.002
So, I covered her mouth real hard.

49:21.044 --> 49:23.380
And finished.

49:23.463 --> 49:27.176
And then I had to tell her
to never say anything…

49:29.178 --> 49:31.763
or, you know, else.

49:32.598 --> 49:34.558
Else-- Or else what?

49:36.059 --> 49:37.060
Well, I don't know.

49:40.022 --> 49:41.106
I do.

49:45.360 --> 49:46.445
Shower, guys.

49:46.528 --> 49:47.571
When?

49:54.119 --> 49:55.704
Did you give it to Carter?

49:56.914 --> 49:58.373
There's nothing there, Jimmy.

50:01.126 --> 50:02.252
Just go back.

50:02.753 --> 50:05.797
Use a flashlight.
It could be pushed back a bit.

50:06.340 --> 50:08.008
I used a flashlight.

50:08.091 --> 50:09.343
I got up on a ladder.

50:09.426 --> 50:12.513
I searched every inch
of all three speakers.

50:12.596 --> 50:13.931
Left, right, center.

50:14.014 --> 50:15.516
There's nothing there, Jimmy.

50:20.270 --> 50:21.563
What are you laughing at?

50:24.358 --> 50:25.484
Am I?

50:27.444 --> 50:29.154
Who else has been at the house?

50:30.239 --> 50:33.408
I go there, check the pipes and whatnot.

50:33.492 --> 50:36.495
Your brother does the same. That's it.

50:37.246 --> 50:38.288
That's it?

50:40.290 --> 50:42.668
Danny stayed there that one weekend.

50:43.877 --> 50:44.878
What weekend?

50:45.379 --> 50:47.047
The weekend that you said he could.

50:47.130 --> 50:49.007
I never said Danny could stay in my house.

50:49.091 --> 50:50.425
You didn't?

50:51.844 --> 50:53.053
I'm gonna kill him.

50:53.679 --> 50:55.222
You let him rip me off for two kilos,

50:55.305 --> 50:57.933
and then you let him take
my last fucking kilo out of my house?

50:58.016 --> 50:59.226
No, Jimmy!

50:59.309 --> 51:01.019
Don't "Jimmy" me!

51:06.108 --> 51:07.734
I'm gonna fucking die in here.

51:09.361 --> 51:10.571
What'd you say?

51:14.408 --> 51:16.159
- Go home.
- No.

51:16.243 --> 51:17.452
- Go.
- Jimmy, I'm gonna--

51:17.536 --> 51:19.663
I'm gonna be at that motel ten miles away!

51:20.414 --> 51:24.126
When you look at these walls at night,
you know that I'm on the other side.

51:25.460 --> 51:26.920
You can bank on it!

51:27.629 --> 51:28.881
- Ji--
- Where's Carter?

51:29.756 --> 51:31.508
Mr. Carter had an emergency.

51:32.050 --> 51:33.260
Now, who the fuck are you?

51:34.761 --> 51:35.846
Walk!

52:32.694 --> 52:35.489
<i>Well, I like Mopar parts, you know.</i>

52:35.572 --> 52:41.245
I like to find these old junkers
people got rusting beneath a tree

52:41.328 --> 52:43.747
or behind their houses.

52:43.830 --> 52:46.834
And then I just maybe know a body shop

52:46.917 --> 52:49.670
that's looking for a tailpipe
or a filter housing.

52:50.963 --> 52:54.007
Buy 'em for 20. I can resell 'em for 35.

52:54.091 --> 52:56.051
Must be a lot of driving around.

52:56.134 --> 52:59.596
Oh, yeah. It's a lot of miles.
But I like driving.

53:24.997 --> 53:26.623
<i>Have you made contact?</i>

53:28.542 --> 53:30.502
Has he said anything about the murders?

53:31.128 --> 53:32.171
No.

53:33.338 --> 53:34.798
We're not at that stage yet.

53:43.015 --> 53:44.641
Do you think he did any of it?

53:46.560 --> 53:48.604
- What?
- Could he just be some sick asshole

53:48.687 --> 53:52.649
who likes taking credit
for things he never did?

53:55.861 --> 53:56.862
No.

53:57.696 --> 53:59.615
- He's a murderer.
- How can you be sure?

53:59.698 --> 54:00.991
You know something I don't?

54:09.416 --> 54:12.377
One of the guards is gonna blow my cover
unless I can get him ten grand.

54:13.128 --> 54:14.796
Might even be too late.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.715
Jimmy, I can't get you ten grand.

54:17.674 --> 54:19.176
Bureau would never approve it.

54:20.052 --> 54:21.303
So, what do I do?

54:22.304 --> 54:23.597
We can get you out.

54:25.432 --> 54:26.767
- Today?
- No.

54:27.559 --> 54:30.103
No. Might take weeks, maybe longer.

54:30.896 --> 54:32.689
But you can go into PC or solitary.

54:33.357 --> 54:35.651
He's a fucking guard. He'll get to me.

54:42.699 --> 54:46.995
Say I could survive in PC or something,
what would happen then?

54:47.704 --> 54:49.581
You'd go back to Milan, do your ten years.

54:49.665 --> 54:51.416
To Hall. What would happen to Hall?

54:53.710 --> 54:56.213
If the appellate court decides
like the other judge did,

54:56.296 --> 54:58.882
that the confession was coerced, I mean…

55:00.092 --> 55:01.510
Your time is up.

55:01.593 --> 55:03.554
Yeah, yeah. I'm wrapping it up.

55:04.805 --> 55:05.806
- What?
- He'll walk.

55:05.889 --> 55:08.100
He'll be out in the world.

55:23.991 --> 55:25.284
Then I'm staying in.

55:28.912 --> 55:30.122
I'm staying in.

55:32.291 --> 55:34.459
- I can't protect you in--
- I know.

55:34.543 --> 55:35.544
I--

55:36.170 --> 55:39.256
So go into PC until we can transfer you.

55:41.383 --> 55:42.384
Can't.

55:43.468 --> 55:44.720
Wish I could, believe me.

55:45.721 --> 55:46.930
Jimmy, listen to me.

55:51.518 --> 55:53.979
Hall confessed to a crime
that we know he didn't do.

55:58.483 --> 56:00.944
- So?
- So that throws all this in doubt.

56:01.028 --> 56:02.196
No, it doesn't.

56:03.572 --> 56:06.283
If something were to happen to you
in here, and he's not our guy--

56:06.366 --> 56:07.743
He's our fucking guy.

56:09.536 --> 56:13.373
I can't think any other way.
I absolutely fucking cannot.

56:13.457 --> 56:14.750
He's our guy.

56:19.713 --> 56:21.381
Accelerate your timetable.

56:22.591 --> 56:26.094
Get Hall to tell you where he buried
those bodies, and we will get you out.

56:35.354 --> 56:36.772
Keep your cell on, Lauren.
