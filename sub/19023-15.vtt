00:11.803 --> 00:13.889
<i>You slept with your best friend!</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:17.351
<i>This will be a disaster
unless you say the right thing,</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:19.520
<i>so choose your words carefully.</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:21.688
Great job last night, buddy.

00:26.276 --> 00:30.447
Good thing you came along.
l've been on four since med school.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.493
Damn it.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.584
We shouldn't feel weird about this.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.879
- Things like this happen all the time.
- All the time!

00:45.963 --> 00:48.215
- lt's not a big deal.
- it's not a big deal.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.968
Stop repeating
what l say in that weird tone.

00:51.051 --> 00:56.223
- No more repeating.
- What happened last night was

00:56.306 --> 00:58.392
a wonderful mistake.

00:58.475 --> 01:03.355
And it's probably best
if we just go back to the way things were.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.941
l totally agree.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.321
l'm gonna see you tomorrow.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.532
Tomorrow.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.160
<i>Elliot's amazing
and you're crazy about her.</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:19.913
<i>If you let her leave,
I'm gonna do this all day:</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:24.126
<i>I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:25.627
<i>I get knocked down...</i>

01:25.711 --> 01:28.130
Wait, Elliot...

01:30.174 --> 01:33.093
l just...

01:35.929 --> 01:38.515
Just say it.
Say, ''Elliot, stay in bed

01:38.599 --> 01:41.685
and have sex with me
until neither of us can move.''

01:41.768 --> 01:44.563
Let's do that.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.649
l cannot believe
you almost let me leave.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.987
You're gonna pay for that.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.406
l'm good for that.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.076
l got to...

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.762 --> 02:20.599
We are really good at having sex.
We should take this show on the road.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.976
My mom would sit in the front row

02:23.060 --> 02:26.021
and tell me l'd look prettier
if l smiled more.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.982
You don't really smile.
You just make this face.

02:29.066 --> 02:33.612
You looked surprised that
you were actually having sex.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.490
l was. l mean, four times?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.659
Give it up.

02:38.742 --> 02:42.704
- l think l already did.
- You did.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.998
How weird was that this morning?

02:45.082 --> 02:49.002
Have you ever been more
uncomfortable in your entire life?

02:49.086 --> 02:51.171
<i>You look hot in that dress.</i>

02:51.255 --> 02:53.340
What movie are we watching?

02:53.423 --> 02:56.176
<i>lt's Basic Instinct, Grandma.</i>

02:56.260 --> 02:59.054
Yeah, once.
But all this sex?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.682
lt just soothes my soul.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.977
And l really like your nose.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.229
How did that last time even start?

03:07.312 --> 03:09.565
l just know l went to the door

03:09.648 --> 03:13.318
and when l came back, you said
l looked sexy holding a pizza.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.488
You did.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.575
For safety reasons, l should go.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.994
You're not going anywhere.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.247
You gotta help me eat this pizza.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.378
Good.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.132
See now, you even look sexy
holding that slice.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.218
- l do, don't l?
- You do.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.394
l was not. You were.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.398
Sometimes l like
a little sugar in my coffee.

03:51.481 --> 03:55.652
l just think it's best
if we keep this between us for now.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.447
lt's hard enough
without everybody talking.

03:58.530 --> 04:02.576
But it'll help people.
Like those two, for instance.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.914
They've been dancing around
each other for months now.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.212
l'm not afraid
to show people here how l feel about you.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.798
You just want the guys
to know you're getting some.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.966
Not just the guys.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.053
Good morning, Dr Cox!

04:21.136 --> 04:23.263
We are short-staffed today

04:23.347 --> 04:26.683
because Kelso has volunteered
all of you scut monkeys

04:26.767 --> 04:29.311
for some psychologist's research project,

04:29.394 --> 04:32.648
which means
you won't be helping patients.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.859
lnstead, you'll be
blabbering about your feelings,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.445
and what it's like
working in the hospital,

04:38.529 --> 04:42.324
and how that affects
your personal lives and...

04:42.407 --> 04:46.537
And there he is now,
big Bob-o himself.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.707
All nurses and interns,
let's gather round

04:50.791 --> 04:52.918
and dance for the puppet master.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.962
Dance!

04:55.045 --> 04:58.298
lt's not just the nurses and interns.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.926
Don't be that guy, Bob.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.971
l guess l became a doctor because

05:04.054 --> 05:07.599
ever since l was a little boy,
l just wanted to help people.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.352
l don't tell this story very often,

05:10.435 --> 05:13.063
but l remember
when l was seven years old,

05:13.146 --> 05:16.108
l found a bird
that had fallen out of its nest.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.694
So, l picked him up
and l brought him home,

05:18.777 --> 05:22.030
and l made him a house
out of an empty shoebox, and...

05:22.114 --> 05:24.533
My God!

05:26.451 --> 05:30.080
l became a doctor for the same
four reasons everybody does:

05:30.163 --> 05:32.499
Chicks, money, power and chicks.

05:32.583 --> 05:35.586
But since HMOs have
made it virtually impossible

05:35.669 --> 05:39.006
to make any real money,
which affects the number of chicks

05:39.089 --> 05:42.885
who come sniffing around, and don't
ask what tree they're barking up,

05:42.968 --> 05:47.014
cos they're sure not pissing on mine.
And as far as power goes, well...

05:47.097 --> 05:50.517
Here l am during my free time
letting some 1 3-year-old

05:50.601 --> 05:55.314
psychology fellow ask me questions
about my personal life.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.775
So here's the inside scoop.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.487
Why don't you go ahead
and tell me all about power?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.574
Check her out.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.202
- Dude, HFFA.
- Excuse me?

06:08.285 --> 06:12.581
HFFA? ''Hot from far away''
but up close she's nasty.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.667
That is so messed up.

06:18.670 --> 06:22.883
l am sorry l made an insensitive
statement about an ugly person.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.968
l'm taking one of those moments

06:25.052 --> 06:28.514
where l weigh your good qualities
against your bad ones

06:28.597 --> 06:31.850
and decide
if you're actually worth the trouble.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.604
You made it. That was close.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.315
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.984
Elliot's looking for a surgical consult.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.072
- Do you know where she is?
- Why should l know?

06:45.155 --> 06:49.910
l know where the Todd
would like Elliot to be. ln his pants.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.411
Clever.

06:51.495 --> 06:55.207
She's not going out with anyone.
You should ask her out.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.043
Elliot and the Todd?
That's a terrible couple.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.672
- Worse than Joanie and Chachi.
- Joanie loves Chachi.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.674
The Todd is asking Elliot out.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.760
- l think she'd be lucky to ride my...
- Please.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.387
...motorcycle.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.264
Gotcha.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.892
God bless him.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.897
When l was seven,
the only things that l loved

07:18.981 --> 07:21.859
were my ColecoVision...
and Sandy Lowe.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.820
Sandy was as fine
as a 7-year-old could be.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.739
She had the body of a 9-year-old.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.243
l joined the T-ball team
because she was on it.

07:31.326 --> 07:34.121
l didn't care that much about sports.

07:34.204 --> 07:38.083
But, during the first game,
l got all caught up,

07:38.167 --> 07:40.586
and fell in love with competing.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.130
And so, through
high school and college,

07:43.213 --> 07:46.967
l pretty much played everything
because l needed to compete.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.136
lt was my drug.

07:50.846 --> 07:55.934
That's why l became a surgeon. Every day,
you get to step up to the table

07:56.018 --> 07:59.271
and go one-on-one against
what's wrong with the patient.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.690
And if you're really good at it,

08:02.858 --> 08:04.943
you win most of the time.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.157
l ran into Sandy Lowe last Christmas,

08:10.240 --> 08:12.201
and she didn't look so good.

08:12.284 --> 08:15.579
And that was kind of awkward, cos,

08:16.246 --> 08:18.415
well, l look like this.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.011
Are you following me?

08:31.094 --> 08:33.514
No. You wanna go out some time?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.015
With you?

08:35.097 --> 08:38.727
Me and a bottle of Jagermeister.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.772
No, Todd, l don't.
But l don't want you to think

08:41.855 --> 08:44.232
it's because l'm a lesbian or anything.

08:44.316 --> 08:50.405
l find you so creepy, l think you should
walk around with a bell around your neck.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.741
All l heard was ''lesbian''.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.661
Let me talk to her for you.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.831
Why did he ask me out?

08:58.914 --> 09:02.292
l don't know.
Because you're cute and you're fun,

09:02.376 --> 09:07.339
and l told him to. Plus, there's rumours
going around that you're a lesbian.

09:07.422 --> 09:12.719
You told me not to tell anyone about us,
so maybe l just wanna make a point.

09:12.803 --> 09:16.181
And now l'm gonna kiss you.

09:22.062 --> 09:26.567
lt's cool. JD's in the closet
talking to a girl for me.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.152
White boys.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.863
You too.

10:23.624 --> 10:28.086
When l was little, my mom used to
have what she called ''episodes''.

10:28.170 --> 10:33.592
''Episodes'' is a flattering term
for this thing where she'd sweat a lot and...

10:33.675 --> 10:37.387
Let's just say her stomach talked.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.641
Anyway, this one time,
we were at the supermarket

10:40.724 --> 10:42.434
and she actually passed out.

10:42.518 --> 10:45.938
And out of nowhere,
this fancy-looking guy comes forward

10:46.021 --> 10:50.609
and tells everyone to step aside
and give my mother some air.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.778
And everyone did.

10:53.570 --> 10:58.617
You have to understand, in my family,
nobody listens to a word anyone else says.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.205
Even screaming
at the top of our lungs... nothing.

11:03.288 --> 11:08.126
So when this man said,
''Step aside'', and everyone did,

11:08.210 --> 11:10.963
l asked my aunt, ''Who is this guy?''

11:11.046 --> 11:13.423
And she said he was a doctor.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.011
And l thought,

11:18.095 --> 11:21.515
''l want to be a doctor too.''

11:24.226 --> 11:28.355
But when l lost my first tooth,
and nobody left $1 80,000

11:28.438 --> 11:31.567
under my pillow,
l decided to become a nurse.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.737
We do all the real stuff anyway.

11:43.370 --> 11:47.082
- You OK?
- Yeah.

11:47.166 --> 11:51.211
l may eventually need a vagina transplant.

11:52.796 --> 11:53.964
Go! Go!

11:55.632 --> 11:57.926
We don't have much time!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.721
You know what?

12:00.804 --> 12:05.976
After l have sex five times with somebody,
l like to have the relationship talk.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.562
l know it seems rushed,
but five times

12:08.645 --> 12:12.983
usually takes me anywhere
between six months and seven years.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.863
Let's do it.
Let's have the talk.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.782
- You my boyfriend?
- Yep. You my girlfriend?

12:20.866 --> 12:22.367
- Yep.
- Cool.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.828
Good to talk things through.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.206
l love that little laugh.

12:27.289 --> 12:30.667
From now on, that is your laugh.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.760
What?

12:39.843 --> 12:44.973
l've seen you naked, so everything
you're doing, l'm watching you do it naked.

12:45.057 --> 12:49.144
So, if l go like this...

12:50.437 --> 12:52.481
l just... l saw all of that.

12:52.564 --> 12:56.527
Don't be shy. Come here, baby.

12:57.861 --> 13:04.117
- The echo report on the aorta...
- Bravo. Just a big bravo.

13:04.201 --> 13:07.412
Heaven help me,
l love newbie theatre.

13:07.496 --> 13:10.707
Honest, l do. lt's the way
you both play your parts

13:10.791 --> 13:14.419
with such wonderful commitment
that almost had me believing

13:14.503 --> 13:18.841
that you aren't having whiny, neurotic,
pale sex with each other.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.009
What are you talking about?

13:21.093 --> 13:24.638
The whole floor knows.
We do. Watch this.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.807
Laverne, did you know?

13:26.890 --> 13:30.143
Was it supposed to be a secret?

13:30.227 --> 13:32.145
And Carla?

13:32.229 --> 13:34.439
Please. l knew before they did.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.608
So, there it is.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.444
And if you go ahead
and listen very carefully,

13:39.528 --> 13:42.865
you'll hear the familiar sound
of no one caring.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.079
l like that guy.

13:49.788 --> 13:54.334
When the Kelsonoviches
settled in Monroeville, PA,

13:54.418 --> 13:57.212
there were two steel mills, three bars,

13:57.296 --> 13:59.923
and not a doctor in sight.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.635
Then my old man set up a shingle

14:03.719 --> 14:06.138
and started delivering babies

14:06.221 --> 14:10.392
and stitching up three-fingered
steel men by the wagonload.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.937
Everybody loved him.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.024
When they couldn't come up with the cash,

14:17.107 --> 14:20.360
he would gladly
accept a handmade sweater

14:20.444 --> 14:23.739
or a bushel of turnips.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.782
Jackass.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.993
Now l get to do this in public.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.836
This is a hospital, all right?
People here are already sick.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.671
You guys do it all the time.

14:39.755 --> 14:43.091
- Tell me we don't look like that.
- We don't look like that.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.010
You guys are just jealous

14:45.093 --> 14:48.472
cos you're not
the hot couple in town any more.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.682
Jealous, my chocolate butt!

14:50.766 --> 14:53.519
l'm telling you, we are so damn hot,

14:53.602 --> 14:56.605
last night, when l was
home waiting for Turk,

14:56.688 --> 15:01.652
l put on this tiny negligee. lt was so small
l took it off my Latin Barbie...

15:01.735 --> 15:04.988
When l got home, you were asleep,
drooling like a sheepdog.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.366
You don't have to tell 'em that.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.159
While you guys were sleeping,

15:09.243 --> 15:12.371
we were up in the kitchen
fryin' up some love.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.708
Relationships? Well, Sigmund,

15:16.792 --> 15:19.920
relationships are so fragile.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.631
lt just takes one thing, one...

15:23.632 --> 15:27.511
...tiny little offence,
and it can snowball on you.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.348
And if that snowball starts
to pick up speed, God forbid,

15:31.431 --> 15:33.684
you better tuck and go.

15:35.477 --> 15:38.105
Why did you do that?
How could you think

15:38.188 --> 15:41.358
that's appropriate conversation for work?

15:41.984 --> 15:45.112
- We didn't have sex.
- No.

15:46.822 --> 15:50.909
- Especially not on the stove. What?
- That is not funny.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.703
Sorry.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.872
We didn't.

15:58.834 --> 16:02.087
That's great. Thanks.

16:02.171 --> 16:04.339
Thanks a lot, JD. Really mature.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.633
Come on.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.218
Elliot.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.980
l am so full.

16:20.063 --> 16:23.317
- Give me another slice.
- Really?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.527
Yeah. Big one.

16:25.611 --> 16:29.990
l cannot have any more
until l work off the last two slices.

16:30.073 --> 16:34.328
So what do you say?
Fat, gassy, bloaty sex?

16:34.411 --> 16:36.246
OK.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.751
- l'm gonna puke!
- l don't care.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.840
Mr Lewis,

16:46.924 --> 16:49.801
we're gonna need another stool sample.

16:49.885 --> 16:54.848
Not for medical reasons.
My robot needs food.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.518
That laugh.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.438
But it's your laugh. l gave it to you.

17:01.522 --> 17:04.107
l love it so much,
l can't stop using it.

17:06.318 --> 17:08.987
lt's not as charming if you're mad.

17:09.070 --> 17:12.991
You only laugh at your own jokes.
You never laugh at anything l do.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.617
That's not true.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.204
...colonoscopy.
Dr Cox, l'm open!

17:17.287 --> 17:19.122
Hit me!

17:22.835 --> 17:25.170
There was nothing funny about that.

17:25.253 --> 17:28.590
Maybe you just don't know funny.
Let me help you out.

17:28.674 --> 17:32.636
<i>Silly hats are funny.
ALF? Very funny!</i>

17:32.719 --> 17:36.974
Anyone in a chicken suit...
Oversized phones are funny.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.393
- JD...
- Hold on.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.519
Hello?

17:41.770 --> 17:43.689
She's right here.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.691
lt's for you.

17:45.774 --> 17:49.653
You know what?
You're not as funny as you think you are.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.197
And bam!

17:52.281 --> 17:54.700
The shine's off the apple.

17:54.783 --> 17:58.078
That's when you find out that
that pretty girl you married

17:58.162 --> 18:02.666
isn't a pretty girl at all.
No. She's a man-eater.

18:02.749 --> 18:07.462
And l'm not talking about the ''Whoa,
whoa, here she comes'' kind of man-eater.

18:07.546 --> 18:11.717
l'm talking about the kind
that uses your dignity as a dishtowel

18:11.800 --> 18:17.472
to wipe up any shreds of manhood
that might be stuck inside the sink.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.684
l may have tormented her
from time to time,

18:20.767 --> 18:23.520
but that's what l thought
marriage was all about.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.857
So much so,
that by the end of that relationship,

18:26.940 --> 18:31.945
l honestly don't know
who l hated more: her or me.

18:33.739 --> 18:36.742
l used to sit around and wonder

18:36.825 --> 18:41.622
why our friends weren't trying
to destroy each other, like we were.

18:41.705 --> 18:45.209
And here it turns out
the answer's pretty simple.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.630
They weren't unhappy.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.883
We were.

18:58.472 --> 19:01.058
l suck at this.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.893
Sorry.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.811
You look great bent over.

19:04.895 --> 19:10.317
l rolled that damn thing exactly
the way the video l bought told me to.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.862
Probably just a bad ball.

19:13.946 --> 19:16.907
You don't have to patronise me.
Tell me that l suck.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.827
lt's hard to be honest
when you're so neurotic

19:19.910 --> 19:23.497
you don't even trust the computer
to keep your score.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.375
- l'm neurotic?
- l'm sorry!

19:27.417 --> 19:31.588
- ls it always this hard?
- Bowling's a tricky sport.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.715
- No, l meant...
- l know.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.884
lt's difficult for everybody.

19:37.135 --> 19:41.139
- My baby got a strike!
- l got a strike!

19:45.227 --> 19:47.479
- My baby did it!
- l got a strike!

19:47.563 --> 19:50.440
Knock 'em down!
My baby know how to knock 'em down!

19:50.524 --> 19:53.193
- Turk! l'm dizzy!
- Sorry.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.779
l'm sorry about him.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.197
My turn!

20:02.870 --> 20:05.080
Want me to pick you up?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.963
Enid has always understood

20:13.046 --> 20:15.841
how much my career meant to me.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.886
She knows
l'm an important man in my field,

20:18.969 --> 20:22.973
and it helps her get on all those
boards of things her friends are on.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.350
You know, like, bringing art

20:25.434 --> 20:29.438
to the underprivileged kids
in the community, blah, blah, blah.

20:30.856 --> 20:34.902
When l first met her,
she wanted to be a psychiatrist.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.362
But we both decided

20:37.446 --> 20:40.949
that that wasn't a fitting profession
for a family woman.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.161
No offence, sweetheart.

20:45.454 --> 20:47.831
l know she's grateful.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.292
She likes to joke that

20:50.375 --> 20:54.630
l choked the last breath of life
out of her long ago.

20:54.713 --> 20:58.008
Now she's just a shell of a woman.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.595
l think that's so cute.
l call her Shelly.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.434
You know, when l call her that,

21:07.518 --> 21:10.312
sometimes she laughs so hard,

21:10.395 --> 21:13.190
she cries a little.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.860
You should've gotten a cardiology fellow

21:16.944 --> 21:20.322
to give Mrs Zuckerman
a transvenous pacemaker one hour ago.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.616
Sir, l was waiting to see...

21:22.699 --> 21:25.494
You were waiting. l'm sorry, that's...

21:25.577 --> 21:28.080
That's my mistake.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.415
l'm gonna wait with ya.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.584
Dr Cox...

21:32.668 --> 21:34.795
Gotta give it time.
Because, you see,

21:34.878 --> 21:38.715
when you're waiting for someone
to get better all by themselves,

21:38.799 --> 21:41.885
the whole thing becomes about time.

21:41.969 --> 21:45.639
l was waiting to see if she would
tolerate her low heart rate,

21:45.722 --> 21:49.101
which is what the textbooks tell us to do.
Am l right, JD?

21:49.184 --> 21:54.398
- ls she right, JD?
- Technically, yes.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.901
But it's really a judgment call,

21:57.985 --> 22:00.362
and if she really was that bradycardic,

22:00.445 --> 22:02.823
l probably would've called the fellow.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.995
But l... That's me. l...

22:10.581 --> 22:13.584
Always side with the hoochie, Newbie?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.836
lt's a rookie mistake.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.005
You hate to see it.

22:20.924 --> 22:24.678
- Tell you about my girlfriend?
- Tell you about my boyfriend?

22:24.761 --> 22:26.597
OK.

22:28.599 --> 22:31.143
l can be myself around Carla.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.687
Turk makes me feel completely safe

22:33.770 --> 22:37.149
and totally independent
at the same time.

22:37.232 --> 22:42.196
And it's all the same,
whether l'm with her or with my boys.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.531
l can say whatever's on my mind.

22:44.615 --> 22:46.783
And even if he doesn't like it,

22:46.867 --> 22:49.828
even if he doesn't understand it,
he respects it.

22:49.912 --> 22:54.875
Don't get me wrong. l'm not gonna
give my boys a back rub.

22:54.958 --> 22:58.420
Sure, if a brother's got an itch,
l'll scratch it, but...

22:58.504 --> 23:01.256
He seems to like who l am.

23:01.340 --> 23:03.425
She's a cool lady.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.554
- l love her.
- l love him.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.438
l should've stood up for you
with Dr Cox.

23:16.522 --> 23:18.315
You should've.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.610
l don't want him to think
it's about our relationship.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.279
l know that you want Dr Cox
to respect you,

23:24.363 --> 23:26.698
but you should want me
to respect you too.

23:26.782 --> 23:30.077
lf l didn't respect you,
l wouldn't be having sex with you.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.289
- That's not true. l would be.
- lf you can't talk for real, forget it.

23:34.373 --> 23:37.876
A perfect dismount
off her high horse.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.922
lf you don't like something, say it.
Why hide behind stupid jokes?

23:42.005 --> 23:44.716
Why is it impossible for you
to let anything go?

23:44.800 --> 23:48.595
l let stuff go, like when you wouldn't
stand up for me with Dr Cox,

23:48.679 --> 23:51.348
or when you told everyone
we're having sex.

23:51.431 --> 23:55.602
- When are you letting that go?
- You wanna know why l won't let that go?

23:55.686 --> 23:57.855
You wouldn't stand up for me

23:57.938 --> 24:01.775
because you're terrified
that someone won't like you.

24:01.859 --> 24:04.611
And that's a bad thing?

24:04.695 --> 24:09.324
Why don't we get all my friends together
in a room and we'll fight your friend.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.829
l'm getting so tired of this.

24:13.912 --> 24:16.165
Elliot, this is me.

24:16.248 --> 24:20.878
And there's a lot of people here
who like me for who l am.

24:20.961 --> 24:26.550
- l thought you were one of 'em.
- l thought l was too.

24:26.633 --> 24:31.096
Relationships don't work
the way they do in the movies.

24:31.180 --> 24:35.684
Will they? Won't they? They finally do
and they're happy for ever.

24:35.767 --> 24:39.771
Nine out of ten end because they
weren't right for each other to begin with,

24:39.855 --> 24:42.941
and half of the ones that get married
get divorced anyway.

24:43.025 --> 24:46.278
And through all this,
l have not become a cynic.

24:46.361 --> 24:51.116
l do happen to believe
that love is mainly about

24:51.200 --> 24:56.830
pushing chocolate-covered candies,
and you know, in some cultures, a chicken.

24:56.914 --> 24:59.416
You can call me a sucker.
l don't care.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.336
Because l do believe in it.

25:03.837 --> 25:07.758
Bottom line is couples
that are right for each other

25:07.841 --> 25:10.427
wade through the same crap
as everybody else.

25:10.511 --> 25:14.348
But the big difference is,
they don't let it take 'em down.

25:14.431 --> 25:18.101
One of those two people
will fight for that relationship

25:18.185 --> 25:22.523
every time, if it's right
and they're real lucky.

25:23.649 --> 25:26.151
One of 'em will say something.

25:38.539 --> 25:42.292
Things that wouldn't have bothered
you a week ago in a friendship

25:42.376 --> 25:46.547
become so incredibly important
when sex is involved.

25:49.341 --> 25:52.803
l just think it'd be easier

25:52.886 --> 25:56.348
if you weren't friends
with your girlfriend

25:56.431 --> 25:59.017
at all.

25:59.101 --> 26:03.522
l've always been sure about everything.
Sure that l wanted to be a doctor,

26:03.605 --> 26:07.526
and l was sure that l was gonna
be married by the time l was 25.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.904
But relationships...

26:11.697 --> 26:15.075
l always heard that
when they were right, they were easy.

26:15.159 --> 26:18.412
That even when things got hard

26:18.495 --> 26:21.206
that they were easy.

26:21.290 --> 26:24.084
l don't get that at all.

26:24.168 --> 26:26.295
How is that possible?

26:27.379 --> 26:29.548
Am l in a relationship now?

26:31.592 --> 26:35.304
No. l'm not in one now.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.184
No.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.872
l can't believe today's over.

27:01.955 --> 27:05.667
- l can't believe l ate half a pizza.
- Please. You had two pieces.

27:05.751 --> 27:10.422
lf you tell anyone anything about today,
please leave that part out.

27:10.506 --> 27:13.050
l will, cos l'm a gentleman.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.935
Do you think this is gonna work out?

27:23.018 --> 27:26.396
Yeah. l think it's gonna be great.

27:34.071 --> 27:36.156
l believe you.

27:37.074 --> 27:39.159
l believe me too.
