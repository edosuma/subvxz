00:36.469 --> 00:38.869
Yo, G, that was hilarious.

00:41.041 --> 00:45.034
<i>Put a Barney Rubble head on,
I'd swear it was Flintstones On Ice.</i>

00:45.945 --> 00:48.743
I'm pleased that I've amused you,
Master William.

00:48.815 --> 00:53.149
It is the least I can do, given the hours
of merriment I have derived...

00:53.219 --> 00:57.485
from looking at the remarkable way
your ears protrude from your head.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.624
BWA: Butler With an Attitude.

01:05.098 --> 01:06.759
So anyway, Toni's coming over.

01:06.833 --> 01:09.267
We're gonna study for
our history midterm together.

01:09.335 --> 01:11.769
- She really needs help.
- She's not doing well?

01:11.838 --> 01:15.865
Daddy, Toni is a dear friend of mine,
but she lacks concentration.

01:15.942 --> 01:18.410
<i>She totally gave up on Twin Peaks.</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:24.782
Wow, Uncle Phil!
Did you lose a couple of pounds?

01:24.951 --> 01:27.181
Man, you're looking chiseled.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.216
So what do you want the car for, Will?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.555
Public Enemy concert.
Jazz got two tickets.

01:33.626 --> 01:38.120
Every time Jazz is in that car he leaves
a small collection of chicken bones behind.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.495
Don't worry. Tonight, we're having ribs.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.394
Daddy, I wanted to use the car tonight.

01:44.471 --> 01:48.168
I'm going to a world peace benefit
hosted by Steven Seagal.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.000
Didn't you just hear me ask first?

01:51.077 --> 01:54.513
I guess you're right. Besides, I'd feel better
knowing you had the car.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.379
Especially if you're
gonna be out again until 3:00 a.m.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.542
3:00 a.m.?

01:58.618 --> 02:02.349
That's what time he got in last night.
Oops, did I say that?

02:03.456 --> 02:05.356
3:00, on a school night?

02:05.425 --> 02:08.121
No, it was for school, Uncle Phil.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.595
I'm doing a term paper on owls.

02:15.101 --> 02:18.502
Will, you've broken curfew
entirely too many times.

02:18.571 --> 02:21.267
- You are grounded for a week.
- A whole week?

02:21.341 --> 02:23.138
Being grounded won't be all bad.

02:23.209 --> 02:26.872
Maybe you'll find enough time to do
your own dishes instead of paying Ashley.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.311
Oops again!

02:29.449 --> 02:30.575
Two weeks.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.880
- I'm grounded for two weeks?
- That's right.

02:32.952 --> 02:36.410
You're to stay in this house, and you're
not to go anywhere near that car.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.423
Can he still rent the car to Jazz?

02:39.025 --> 02:40.322
Oops!

02:41.161 --> 02:43.322
Let's make it an even month.

02:47.066 --> 02:49.296
I don't know my own strength.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.134
Revenge!

04:05.378 --> 04:06.572
Miss Toni.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.944
- Hi, Toni.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.142
I saw a lady wearing a sweater so ugly...

04:11.217 --> 04:13.981
I was forced to pull over and yell at her.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.886
Hi, Toni. What are you two up to?

04:17.957 --> 04:20.084
The library. Big history exam.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.649
How did your English midterm go?

04:21.728 --> 04:24.128
- I think I did great, Mom.
- I think I failed it.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.563
Will you cut it out?
You always say you've failed...

04:26.633 --> 04:29.932
and then you get the test back
and you always get a "D."

04:30.803 --> 04:33.271
You're right. I probably did fine.

04:34.841 --> 04:35.933
Okay.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.342
You two have fun at the library.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.504
Bye.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.279
A library?
I thought we were going shopping.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.478
We are. I was just saying that to her.
Come on.

04:55.561 --> 04:59.019
What's this I hear, Hilary?
Lying to Mommy?

05:00.166 --> 05:02.691
I feel that revenge is within my reach.

05:02.769 --> 05:05.761
This is a job for Sherlock Homeboy.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.217
1000 hours. Bike not fast enough
to keep up with Volvo.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.988
Here at Toni's dorm room to determine
where suspects went shopping.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.765
Let's see what happens.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.167
Hi, is this Toni Gower's room?

05:39.238 --> 05:41.069
- We're her roommates.
- I'm Kimmy.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.334
- I'm Cindy.
- I'm Will.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.376
- Hi, Willie.
- Hi, Willie.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.275
No, just "Will."

05:47.347 --> 05:49.611
Can I get you something, Will?

05:50.750 --> 05:54.151
No, thank you.
I'm trying to find Hilary Banks.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.211
There's been a family emergency.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.984
Sorry, we don't know her.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.924
Yes, we do. You know, Toni's friend.

06:00.993 --> 06:04.292
- The one who never wears anything twice.
- Yeah.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.922
Earth to Kimmy.

06:06.666 --> 06:10.568
I just haven't seen her around
since she dropped out of school.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.940
Yeah, the midterms must have been
a little too much for her.

06:19.011 --> 06:22.037
Midterms? Hilary dropped out
three months ago.

06:22.949 --> 06:26.316
This family emergency,
is it, like, a big one?

06:27.086 --> 06:29.452
It's even bigger than I thought.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.348
Looks like I am gonna be
pulling another all-nighter.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.884
I have to get my index cards together
for the big debate match next week.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.089
What's your topic?

06:38.164 --> 06:40.724
"When President Bush said
he would never raise taxes...

06:40.800 --> 06:43.166
"was he lying or just kidding?"

06:47.106 --> 06:50.234
Sorry I'm late.
Time flies when you're studying.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.436
Ain't that the truth, Ruth.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.610
How was your day, honey?

06:55.681 --> 06:59.879
It was great. I got a lot of work done
on my physics research paper.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.148
What?

07:03.623 --> 07:07.320
I was just thinking about that funny thing
that happened to you today.

07:07.393 --> 07:09.122
What are you talking about?

07:09.195 --> 07:11.720
How soon they forget. I'll explain.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.932
Today after school was out,
I went to UCLA...

07:15.001 --> 07:17.993
and sat in the back
of Hilary's physics class.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.332
You did?

07:21.140 --> 07:24.871
You remember.
After all, you were in the class.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.771
That's right. You did.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.343
You remember that funny thing
that happened.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.318
Yeah, that funny thing.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.226
Tell them about it.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.627
Will sat in the back of my physics class.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.726
While he was there...

07:51.504 --> 07:53.938
Will, you tell it so much better.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.606
See, I snuck up behind Hilary, right?

07:57.677 --> 08:01.135
Her head must have been full
with all that studying or something...

08:01.214 --> 08:02.374
because when she saw me...

08:02.448 --> 08:06.009
she said my head looked
like the basic element of physics.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.645
What was that technical term again?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.786
A quark, right?

08:10.857 --> 08:13.883
Right. Exactly.
I said his head looked like a quark.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.087
- Or was it a neutron?
- Right.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.096
No, it was definitely a quark.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.656
Of course. I don't know
what I must have been thinking.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.969
That was a real scream, Will.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.904
Dinner is served.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.977
What do you know?

08:41.419 --> 08:45.447
First of all, I know that
the basic element of physics is matter.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.516
If you were going to do a research paper...

08:47.593 --> 08:51.757
you'd probably have to know something
they taught on the first day.

08:52.331 --> 08:55.596
- How did you find out?
- I have my methods.

08:55.668 --> 08:59.627
It helps that Toni's roommates
have the combined IQ of a raisin.

09:00.072 --> 09:03.132
Listen to me, Will.
You can't tell Mom and Dad.

09:03.409 --> 09:04.569
Excuse me?

09:04.644 --> 09:09.172
You're not in any position to tell me
what I can or cannot do, Miss Thing.

09:13.619 --> 09:16.315
I'll do anything you want. Just name it.

09:17.523 --> 09:20.117
Thanks to you,
I'm grounded for the next month.

09:20.192 --> 09:24.390
All I want from you is that you make
that month as pleasant as possible.

09:24.463 --> 09:25.691
It's that simple.

09:25.765 --> 09:30.202
At the risk of sounding redundant,
dinner is served.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.501
We'll be right there, Geoffrey.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.100
- Hilary?
- What?

09:39.378 --> 09:40.640
Carry me.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.250
Yes?

09:53.326 --> 09:54.725
"Yes," what?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.524
Yes, Your Highness?

09:59.231 --> 10:01.791
- Have you done His Highness' laundry?
- Yes.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.931
Yes, Your Highness.

10:05.204 --> 10:09.766
You forgot His Highness' overalls,
his T-shirt, and...

10:12.878 --> 10:15.506
of course, his pair of lucky drawers.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.314
You're going to want to hand wash these.

10:22.588 --> 10:26.490
- I am not hand washing your drawers.
- Yes, you are.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.995
And from now on,
you will pronounce the word "draws."

10:33.099 --> 10:34.464
Okay, fine.

10:37.269 --> 10:41.865
And His Highness would like to discuss
the condition of his royal sneakers.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.641
You will clean them with your toothbrush.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.403
Not side to side, though. Not up and down.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.608
But a smooth circular motion.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.919
Do you want me to floss them, too?

10:55.221 --> 10:56.916
We are not amused.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.683
And for this act of treason...

10:59.759 --> 11:03.320
His Highness would like you
to read him a bedtime story.

11:04.296 --> 11:06.389
This is getting really annoying, Will.

11:06.465 --> 11:09.730
Okey dokey, have it your way.
Uncle Phil! Aunt Viv!

11:09.802 --> 11:11.463
Okay, I'll do it!

11:12.204 --> 11:15.230
<i>His Highness would like you to read
this Spider-Man comic book.</i>

11:15.307 --> 11:17.673
All right. Let's make this fast.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.538
<i>"Spider-Man. By Stan Lee."</i>

11:20.012 --> 11:22.139
The yellow box says:
"High above Manhattan."

11:22.214 --> 11:25.706
And Spider-Man goes, "My spider-sense
is buzzing like a beehive."

11:25.785 --> 11:29.585
His Highness would like you to describe
everything in the picture.

11:29.655 --> 11:31.714
- Can't you just look at it?
- Uncle Phil!

11:31.791 --> 11:33.452
I was just asking.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.222
He's sitting on the edge
of some stupid building...

11:36.295 --> 11:39.594
and there are wavy lines
coming out of his head...

11:39.665 --> 11:42.657
so he's hot,
or his head smells or something.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.564
Anyway...

11:45.104 --> 11:47.470
Hilary. That's his spidey-sense.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.065
Okay.

11:49.141 --> 11:52.577
There's also something gross
coming out of his wrist.

11:52.645 --> 11:57.014
Is this the guy you don't want to be
standing next to at a party, or what?

11:58.584 --> 12:01.781
Anyway, this fat guy in a really bad suit
grabs him and goes:

12:01.854 --> 12:03.515
"Spider-Man, at last we meet again."

12:03.589 --> 12:08.185
That's Doctor Octopus, but his voice
is a lot deeper than that. Give it a try.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.986
"At last, we meet again."

12:11.063 --> 12:12.724
And it's raspier.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.324
"At last, we meet again."

12:16.402 --> 12:18.666
Come on, baby. You doggin' it.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.897
"At last, we meet again!"

12:22.441 --> 12:23.635
Happy?

12:24.143 --> 12:28.773
You have amused us, but His Highness
is tired and would like to go to sleep.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.179
Thank God.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.548
But first, His Highness
would like to be tucked in.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.347
- You're kidding.
- Of course, I'm kidding. Uncle Phil!

12:39.091 --> 12:40.615
Nice and tight!

12:41.127 --> 12:44.221
Not too tight.
I wouldn't want you to suffocate.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.099
Before you go,
we would like you to have this.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.864
A list of things to do tomorrow night
at the dinner table.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.302
Like what?

12:53.372 --> 12:56.307
Please, we do not wish them
read in our presence.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.672
Be gone!

13:04.416 --> 13:06.680
Carlton, I'm living a nightmare.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.617
Hilary, I'd love to talk to you...

13:08.687 --> 13:11.451
but I'm staring down the barrel
of an all-nighter.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.424
Please, Carlton, I need help!

13:13.492 --> 13:16.586
I'm coming to you because
I know how much you don't like Will.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.994
Will Smith is a fine young man.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.768
Come off it, Carlton.
You're talking to me now.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.359
We've let Will wreak havoc
in our lives for too long.

13:25.437 --> 13:28.600
And now it's time to band against him
as brother and sister.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.198
What have you got in mind?

13:30.276 --> 13:31.743
That's what I need you for.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.178
I don't have any plans,
I just want to punish him.

13:35.247 --> 13:38.239
I'm very vindictive,
I'm just not imaginative.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.211
Whether or not I want to punish Will...

13:41.287 --> 13:44.415
and for the record,
I haven't come out pro or con...

13:44.490 --> 13:46.583
why are you so mad at him?

13:47.092 --> 13:50.323
It's a long story, but you have to promise
not to tell anybody.

13:50.396 --> 13:51.522
Sure.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.394
First of all, I dropped out of college.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.302
- I know!
- Mom and Dad are gonna kill you.

13:57.369 --> 13:59.428
I know, but the worst thing
is Will found out.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.633
Now he's using it to make me do
all kinds of humiliating things.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.073
Like what?

14:04.343 --> 14:06.675
He's making me clean his sneakers.

14:06.745 --> 14:09.009
- Really?
- It gets worse.

14:09.882 --> 14:12.510
I have to hand wash his lucky "draws."

14:14.920 --> 14:17.650
- Disgusting.
- And this is his latest:

14:18.324 --> 14:22.158
He gave me a list of embarrassing things
I have to do at dinner tomorrow night.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.661
That's awful.

14:23.729 --> 14:26.289
- Is he making you clean his room?
- No.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.162
Will you clean mine?

14:38.210 --> 14:41.145
I'm sorry, but this is too good to be true.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.682
Why should Will have all the fun?

14:44.950 --> 14:46.611
- Why, you little...
- Dad?

14:46.685 --> 14:48.050
I hate you!

14:49.588 --> 14:51.783
Be that as it may...

14:51.857 --> 14:55.190
I want these debate cards
typed by tomorrow morning.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.785
Double-spaced.

15:03.335 --> 15:06.463
Today was Career Day
and Teresa's dad came in to speak to us.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.165
Really? What does he do?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.639
Joan Rivers.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.045
He's a plastic surgeon.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.276
Dinner is served.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.247
What?

15:27.326 --> 15:30.921
Did you memorize that list of things
I gave you to do at dinner tonight?

15:30.996 --> 15:32.156
Yes.

15:32.231 --> 15:35.291
Just to be on the safe side,
let's have a little pop quiz.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.859
Number one: Any time Uncle Phil
takes a drink, what do you do?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.803
- I compliment you.
- Yes!

15:41.907 --> 15:43.898
Did you memorize
the list of compliments?

15:43.976 --> 15:45.841
- Yes.
- Okay, very good.

15:46.045 --> 15:50.243
Number two: Any time anyone
says "Hilary," what do you do?

15:50.916 --> 15:52.611
I bark like a dog.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.548
That's right! See you at dinner.

15:57.423 --> 16:01.826
Will, if you have an ounce of compassion,
you'll let me off the hook.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.954
Yeah, that's a good point.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.889
No, we'll do it anyway.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.839
It's dinner time.
Did you memorize our list?

16:15.908 --> 16:18.570
- Yes.
- Let's just review.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.636
What do you do
when I hit my glass with my spoon?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.147
I insult Will.

16:23.215 --> 16:26.309
Good. And what do you do
when I clear my throat?

16:26.385 --> 16:28.580
I smack Will upside the head.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.813
Damn it, you're prepared! Let's go!

16:33.359 --> 16:35.384
For these gifts we are about to receive...

16:35.461 --> 16:37.793
may the Lord make us
truly thankful. Amen.

16:37.863 --> 16:38.852
Amen.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.523
Vivian, how were your classes today?

16:40.599 --> 16:43.864
Fine. I just wish my students
would concentrate more on their work.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.733
They're very easily distracted.

16:45.804 --> 16:49.604
I see it every day. Don't you, Hilary?

16:58.183 --> 17:00.743
- Did you say something, sweetie?
- No.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.819
Will Smith is perfect.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.650
Why, thank you.
It's so nice to be appreciated.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.990
Yes, but perhaps another time.

17:10.762 --> 17:14.722
Your mother would appreciate
it if she weren't interrupted again.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.960
Sorry.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.060
Anyway, as I was saying...

17:18.137 --> 17:20.867
Will Smith is the king of the universe.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.633
Why, thank you.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.843
I'd like to finish my story,
if that's okay with you, Hilary.

17:35.521 --> 17:36.715
Hilary?

17:41.427 --> 17:45.158
Look, I know everyone gets a little silly
around midterms...

17:45.364 --> 17:47.491
but not at the dinner table.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.124
I'm sorry, Mom.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.095
Will Smith is the scum of the earth.

17:52.671 --> 17:53.763
Hilary!

17:58.277 --> 18:01.474
However, Will Smith
is the pinnacle of manliness.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.512
Hilary!

18:17.463 --> 18:19.226
What's with Hilary?

18:25.137 --> 18:27.935
Stop it! I can't take it anymore!

18:28.006 --> 18:30.338
I dropped out of school! There!

18:31.376 --> 18:32.866
You did what?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.744
- I dropped out of school.
- You dropped out of school?

18:36.815 --> 18:39.079
- When did this happen?
- Three months ago.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.143
- Three months ago?
- And you've been lying to us since then?

18:42.221 --> 18:44.815
- Three months ago?
- Let me explain.

18:44.890 --> 18:48.348
- Three months ago?
- Mother, please just let me explain.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.759
I'm not interested. You've been lying to us.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.992
- And if you think for one minute...
- Philip, wait.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.661
Will, Carlton, Ashley,
take your dinner into the kitchen.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.867
Thanks a lot, Will.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.705
Man, they've been in there for an hour.

19:06.778 --> 19:10.179
I wonder what Hilary told Mom and Dad
about our part in all this.

19:10.249 --> 19:13.878
I think it's pretty safe to assume
she sang like a canary.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.444
There's no need to worry.
She's been lying to them for three months.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.185
We can punch holes in her credibility.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.152
Mom, Dad, awfully sad about
what happened to Hilary.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.323
Hope her crazy lies
don't drag down anyone else.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.001
Carlton, sit.

19:36.575 --> 19:39.738
Maybe we haven't been clear enough
about the rules of this house.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.609
You are not to blackmail
other members of this family.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.013
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.852
You two are grounded for a month.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.223
Will, added to the month
you already have...

19:55.294 --> 19:58.457
that should pretty much take you
into fiscal '91.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.090
- Dad!
- You are excused.

20:08.106 --> 20:10.040
I don't know, Philip. I've been thinking.

20:10.108 --> 20:13.305
- About what?
- You know, what Hilary said to us.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.778
That I put too much pressure on her.

20:15.847 --> 20:18.907
That it's hard living up
to a mother who's a college professor.

20:18.984 --> 20:22.818
That I made her feel that she could
never come to us and admit she failed.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.118
You mean you bought that crap?

20:27.726 --> 20:31.127
Mom, Dad, can I say something?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.224
Yes.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.729
I've been thinking.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.668
And I decided that I'll do whatever
you want me to do to make things better.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.001
And exactly what would that be?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.837
I don't know.
Whatever you want me to do.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.735
Hilary, that's the problem.

20:49.848 --> 20:52.043
We've been making
all the decisions for you.

20:52.117 --> 20:55.280
You're 21 years old. It's time for you
to make your own decisions.

20:55.354 --> 20:58.790
If you weren't getting anything
out of college and wanted to drop out...

20:58.857 --> 21:01.587
you should have told us
and not tried to hide it like a kid.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.651
But I thought you wanted me
to go to college.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.254
We want you to go to college
when you'll appreciate it.

21:06.331 --> 21:09.528
It's not to make us happy.
It's to make something of your life.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.728
We just want you to be all you can be.

21:11.803 --> 21:14.033
You want me to join the Army?

21:17.709 --> 21:19.540
Let's try this again.

21:20.979 --> 21:24.005
Hilary, what do you want
to do with your life?

21:26.184 --> 21:29.449
I don't know.
I guess I'll have to think about it.

21:29.955 --> 21:34.085
While you're thinking about it,
you're going to get yourself a job.

21:35.193 --> 21:36.285
Okay.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.062
Good night.

21:39.898 --> 21:41.160
Mom, Dad?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.997
What kind of job do you want me to get?

21:56.882 --> 21:58.782
I'm not talking to you.

21:59.951 --> 22:03.648
Look, straight up. I didn't know
you'd break down like that.

22:03.722 --> 22:06.418
You walk around here
like nothing bothers you.

22:06.491 --> 22:10.825
And I guess I took it a little too far,
and I just wanna say I'm sorry.

22:10.896 --> 22:14.195
Yeah, now. An hour ago
you were ready to tell on me.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.167
You tripping!
I was never going to tell on you.

22:17.235 --> 22:19.726
- Really?
- Come on, of course not.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.529
How about you, Carlton?

22:21.606 --> 22:24.166
We're dealing in hypotheticals here.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.036
Fine. I wasn't going to tell.

22:27.112 --> 22:30.479
Does that little placebo
make either of you feel any better?

22:32.818 --> 22:36.151
So, I guess you're gonna
hate me forever, right?

22:37.255 --> 22:41.282
I thought about it. I guess
I brought this whole thing on myself.

22:41.893 --> 22:45.090
If I hadn't gotten you grounded,
you wouldn't have blackmailed me.

22:45.163 --> 22:48.030
So, I've learned my lesson.
And we're even.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.361
That's decent, Hilary.

22:51.636 --> 22:53.035
Good night.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.038
Before you go...

22:55.107 --> 22:59.066
as my last official act of servitude,
I did finish your laundry.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.906
I can't believe
I made you do that. I'm sorry.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.643
It's okay. What's done is done.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.850
My lucky "draws"!
