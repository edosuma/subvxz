Oh, oh, guess what
"Sesame Street"

is about today.

00:21.533 --> 00:22.834
- No idea.
- Couldn't tell you.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.166
- Oh, OK. Well, here's a clue.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.300
It's got sand and water,

00:27.367 --> 00:29.867
oh, and crabs,
clams, and gulls

00:29.934 --> 00:31.367
can be seen there, too.

00:31.433 --> 00:32.900
- Restaurant.
- A park.

00:32.967 --> 00:36.066
- No, not the laundromat.

00:36.133 --> 00:37.400
- The beach.

00:37.467 --> 00:38.734
Yeah. Stick around

00:38.800 --> 00:40.266

on "Sesame Street."

- Elmo: Yeah. Elmo--

01:19.333 --> 01:21.133
We went camping--
Elmo's mommy and daddy.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.600
Alan: Yeah.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.166
Yeah, and here's
a roller coaster.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.367
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.800
Oh, pretty lights.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.467
Oh, hi.
Hey, welcome to Sesame Street.

01:28.533 --> 01:30.100
You know what?
You're just in time.

01:30.166 --> 01:31.133
Elmo was showing us

01:31.200 --> 01:32.600
pictures
from his vacation.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.900
- That's right. Oh, look.
- Come and see.

01:34.967 --> 01:36.600
Here, Elmo's
on a water slide,

01:36.667 --> 01:37.800
and over here,

01:37.867 --> 01:39.433
Elmo is playing goofy golf.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.433
Hey, it looks
like you had

01:40.500 --> 01:41.567
a really fun
vacation, Elmo.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.000
Yeah. Elmo did.
It was cool.

01:43.066 --> 01:44.500
Yeah? Hey--
how about you, Count?

01:46.100 --> 01:48.033
Oh, yes.
I did, Alan.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.533
I flew through
several wonderful caves.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.800
Ha ha!
Look at this.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.166
- OK.
- OK.

01:59.233 --> 02:01.000
Well, me take vacation, too.

02:01.066 --> 02:03.000
To a cookie factory?

02:03.066 --> 02:04.800
- Lucky guess.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.767
But me have
no pictures, though.

02:06.834 --> 02:08.767
Because you
ate those, too?

02:08.834 --> 02:10.200
Another lucky guess.

02:10.266 --> 02:12.166
Oh, that makes three.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.300
Three fantastic vacations.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.333
Ah ah ah!

02:16.400 --> 02:17.667
All right. I'm off
to get supplies.

02:17.734 --> 02:19.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Hold on.

02:19.066 --> 02:20.233
What?

02:20.300 --> 02:22.133
Where did Alan
go on vacation?

02:22.200 --> 02:23.166
Yeah, yeah.
Where'd you go?

02:23.233 --> 02:24.333
Yeah.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.166
Oh, well, actually,

02:26.233 --> 02:27.767
I didn't take
a vacation this year.

02:27.834 --> 02:30.233
No vacation?

02:30.300 --> 02:31.266
Yeah.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.500
Not everyone can
take a vacation.

02:33.567 --> 02:34.900
Sometimes,
people don't have

02:34.967 --> 02:36.500
enough money to travel.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.200
Other times,
people can't go away

02:38.266 --> 02:39.934
because of work,

02:40.000 --> 02:41.867
but, if I could take a trip,

02:41.934 --> 02:43.300
I'd head to the beach.

02:44.967 --> 02:46.300
Here is a photo

02:46.367 --> 02:48.867
from a vacation
I took a few years ago.

02:48.934 --> 02:53.700
You see? The warm water,
the sand, the breezes.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.800
Well, maybe next year.

02:58.867 --> 03:01.700
All right.
I'll see you guys later.

03:01.767 --> 03:04.633
Cookie Monster: Bye, Alan.
Bye, Elmo. Me gonna go, too.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.200
OK. Bye, guys.

03:07.266 --> 03:10.900
Boy, Elmo's really sad

03:10.967 --> 03:14.500
that Alan didn't get to go
to the beach this year.

03:14.567 --> 03:18.967
Oh, wait a minute--
Elmo has an idea!

03:19.033 --> 03:20.900
Oh, if Alan can't go
to the beach,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.333
Elmo will bring the beach
to Alan. Ha ha ha!

03:24.400 --> 03:26.567
Uh, how do you plan
to do that, Elmo?

03:26.633 --> 03:28.266
Oh, well, Elmo
will make a beach

03:28.333 --> 03:29.934
right here
on Sesame Street.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.233
Wait a minute.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.900
Did I hear someone say
they want to make

03:32.967 --> 03:34.734
a beach on Sesame Street?

03:34.800 --> 03:36.467
- Yeah. Elmo just said that--
- Say no more because I--

03:36.533 --> 03:38.834
Grover, your perpetually
adorable monster,

03:38.900 --> 03:40.266
- will help you make one.
- Yeah, but--

03:40.333 --> 03:42.934
- One relaxing beach coming up.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.533
We got this, wha--

03:44.600 --> 03:47.000
Here you go.

03:47.066 --> 03:48.433
♪ Hmm hmm hmm ♪

03:48.500 --> 03:50.967
Grover, why is there
a bathtub out here?

03:51.033 --> 03:53.100
It is a relaxing beach.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.200
Elmo: Grover,
a bathtub isn't a beach.

03:56.266 --> 03:57.667
Bathtub: Why not?

03:57.734 --> 04:01.200
I'm full of warm water,
and I'm very relaxing.

04:01.266 --> 04:04.433
Yes, but a beach is more
than just warm water.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.233
Yeah. You know,
uh, Grover,

04:06.300 --> 04:07.400
- this is very helpful--
- You're welcome.

04:07.467 --> 04:08.867
But, you know,
a beach has things

04:08.934 --> 04:10.734
like, oh, sand--

04:10.800 --> 04:12.266
Sand

04:12.333 --> 04:14.433
Oh, why did you not say so?

04:14.500 --> 04:16.166
I will be right back.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.767
Sorry to have to pull
the plug on you.

04:17.834 --> 04:20.367
Oh, well. It was fun
while it lasted.

04:20.433 --> 04:21.600
Boy, Chris,

04:21.667 --> 04:22.633
where are we gonna find

04:22.700 --> 04:24.734
sand on Sesame Street?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.033
- Oh.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.400
- Oh.
- Oh.

04:27.467 --> 04:28.600
Elmo:
Boy, this is heavy.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.000
Chris: To the table--
almost there.

04:30.066 --> 04:32.567
Ah, right here.
There you go. Ha ha ha!

04:32.633 --> 04:34.000
- Whew!
- Oh, ho ho ho!

04:34.066 --> 04:35.900
- Grover: Oh, yeah.
- OK. Wonderful.

04:35.967 --> 04:37.467
We got some sand.
Thank you, Grover. Now--

04:37.533 --> 04:39.166
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We are not done yet.

04:39.233 --> 04:41.066
We're not?

04:41.133 --> 04:43.734
Grover:

04:43.800 --> 04:45.633
♪ Ta-da ♪

04:45.700 --> 04:47.533
A pyramid?

04:47.600 --> 04:48.967
Uh, Grover,
what is all this

04:49.033 --> 04:50.767
supposed to be?

04:50.834 --> 04:52.233
Welcome to
the beautiful beach,

04:52.300 --> 04:53.433
Chris.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.700
See? We have lots of sand...

04:55.767 --> 04:58.567
and a pyramid... and a camel.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.200
Camel?

05:00.266 --> 05:02.433
- Hi.
- Aah! Dude, come on.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.834
Uh, hi.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.200
Grover,
this is not a beach.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.233
Right. OK. Grover,
this is wonderful.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.767
You know,
sand is at a beach--

05:09.834 --> 05:10.867
- that's true--
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:10.934 --> 05:12.400
but a beach has
lots of things,

05:12.467 --> 05:14.133
like, um--
oh, like a nice,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.400
swaying,
gentle breeze--

05:16.467 --> 05:17.500
A breeze? Do not worry.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.166
I am on it.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.200
- Oh. What--
- Oh!

05:21.266 --> 05:22.900
This should do the trick.

05:22.967 --> 05:25.600
- Hey, a fan.
- Yeah.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.133
That's a great idea, Grover.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.700
One gentle breeze
coming at you.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.133
- Good.
- Oh. Oh! Oh, whoa!

05:31.200 --> 05:33.333
Whoa! Stop! Stop!

05:33.400 --> 05:35.033
Turn off the fan!

05:35.100 --> 05:36.333
Oh, yes. I'm sorry
about that. Yes.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.767
Whoa! Whoa! Ow! Ow!

05:37.834 --> 05:41.133
Oh, no.
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

05:41.200 --> 05:44.033
Grover:
Ow! Ohh... I am OK.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.567
Grover, camels
and pyramids

05:46.633 --> 05:48.967
are not found
on beaches, OK?

05:49.033 --> 05:50.400
They're found
in deserts.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.600
Take a look. Excuse me.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.367
Oh, sure.

05:54.433 --> 05:55.700
♪ Ta-da ♪

05:55.767 --> 05:57.433
Aha. Here we go.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.533
I think I got it...
I got it.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.834
Ha ha! OK.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.500
This is a desert, OK?

06:02.567 --> 06:04.300
Elmo: Right.

06:04.367 --> 06:05.734
- Hey, so's this.
- Elmo and Grover: Mm-hmm.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.767
- OK. Hey, so's that.
- Elmo: Yeah.

06:07.834 --> 06:11.133
Yeah. You see,
deserts have a lot of sand...

06:11.200 --> 06:12.433
Grover: Right.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.867
Oh, and sometimes camels.

06:15.533 --> 06:17.567
OK. Now, see, this--
this is a beach.

06:17.633 --> 06:18.834
Elmo: Right.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.266
A beach has
a lot of sand, too,

06:20.333 --> 06:22.467
but it is found
by a large body of water...

06:22.533 --> 06:23.734
Ohh.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.433
Like an ocean.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.066
Yeah, oh--

06:27.133 --> 06:29.600
and Alan likes
ocean beaches.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.133
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.667
Now, beaches
don't have camels.

06:32.734 --> 06:33.800
Right.

06:33.867 --> 06:36.133
- Sorry, buddy.
- Camel: That's OK.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.600
Hey, OK. Here we go.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.967
Beaches have animals
like gulls.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.266
- Elmo: Right.
- Mm-hmm.

06:41.333 --> 06:44.000
OK. Beaches
also have crabs.

06:44.066 --> 06:45.467
- Elmo: Look at that crab.
- Ha ha ha!

06:45.533 --> 06:47.233
Cool. Let's see.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.500
Oh, beaches also
sometimes have clams.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.166
- Elmo: A lot of clams.
- Grover: So many of them.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.900
OK, and let's see.

06:52.967 --> 06:54.800
Oh, and sometimes
people like to surf

06:54.867 --> 06:55.967
on the waves at beaches.

06:56.033 --> 06:57.667
Yeah.

06:57.734 --> 07:00.133
So, what you're saying, then,

07:00.200 --> 07:02.834
is that this is a beach.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.633
- Not a beach...
- Not a beach. No.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.934
OK...
because Sesame Street

07:06.000 --> 07:07.266
doesn't have water.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.200
- Water.
- Fear not, then.

07:09.266 --> 07:10.867
I have the solution.

07:10.934 --> 07:12.166
- Wait, Grover. Yo, Grover.
No, no.

07:12.233 --> 07:13.166
- Yo, Grover.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.367
You're not gonna bring

07:14.433 --> 07:16.066
that bathtub back
in here, are you?

07:16.133 --> 07:19.400
What? No.
Don't be sil--

07:19.467 --> 07:21.500
I was considering it.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.400
Wait a minute.

07:23.467 --> 07:26.233
Oh, Elmo has an idea.
Oh, be right back.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.500
- Hey.
- Oh!

07:27.567 --> 07:28.533
Elmo: Coming through!

07:28.600 --> 07:29.700
You guys still need me?

07:29.767 --> 07:31.000
I got a thing
I got to go do.

07:31.066 --> 07:32.300
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Go right ahead.

07:32.367 --> 07:33.900
- You are released.
- Oh, super.

07:33.967 --> 07:36.633
- Bye.

Yeah, everything.
Great job, Elmo.

Hey, Grover,
you can help Elmo.

Really? What,
that one right there?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.633
- Elmo: That one.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.300
I love to push buttons.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.200
Ha ha ha!

08:15.266 --> 08:17.066
I did that.

08:17.133 --> 08:20.133
Wow. OK, Elmo.
I am impressed.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.066
This looks like
a real beach.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.367
Of course, a real beach
would be much bigger,

08:24.433 --> 08:25.900
and the water
would be real,

08:25.967 --> 08:27.333
but, hey, this is probably
the next best thing.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.700
Hey, you--

08:28.767 --> 08:30.433
what is all this,
you guys?

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
Oh, can't you tell?

08:32.567 --> 08:33.700
Yeah!

08:33.767 --> 08:34.934
It's a beach, Alan.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.333
Oh, Elmo and Grover
made it for Alan

08:36.400 --> 08:39.000
because Alan didn't get
to take a vacation this year.

08:39.066 --> 08:40.333
Oh, what do you think
of it, Alan?

08:40.400 --> 08:41.567
Yeah. Yeah.
Do you like it?

08:41.633 --> 08:42.700
I pushed the button.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.367
- Grover: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:44.433 --> 08:45.900
Oh, that's so kind
of all of you

08:45.967 --> 08:47.900
to do this for me.

08:47.967 --> 08:50.100
I'm really touched.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.767
I don't know what else
to say, other than...

11:19.100 --> 11:22.367
Beaches are where
the water meets the shore

11:22.433 --> 11:25.734
and found
at oceans and lakes.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.767
They are made up of sand,

11:27.834 --> 11:30.567
which is made up
of tiny rocks,

11:30.633 --> 11:32.133
sometimes even shells.

11:33.967 --> 11:37.533
You can do lots
of fun things at the beach,

11:37.600 --> 11:38.633
like play in the water...

11:38.700 --> 11:40.400
Man and kids: Whoo!

11:40.467 --> 11:41.834
explore nature...

11:41.900 --> 11:44.734
- Boy: A baby crab.
- Father: Over there.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.333
build a sand castle...

11:49.633 --> 11:51.800
and even fly.

11:51.867 --> 11:55.934
It's a great way to spend
a day with your family

11:56.000 --> 11:58.066
and watch the sunset.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.533
I love going to the beach.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.200
"B" is for "beach."

12:08.266 --> 12:10.867
The letter, "B".

12:23.166 --> 12:24.467
Together,

12:24.533 --> 12:27.100
to stop The Crumb.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.367
Today, I'm going
to ruin someone's day

12:29.433 --> 12:30.767
at the beach!

12:32.667 --> 12:34.066
Figby:
I've located The Crumb!

12:34.133 --> 12:35.667
All:
Let's roll!

12:47.567 --> 12:49.633
I don't want The Crumb

12:49.700 --> 12:52.533
to ruin my beautiful
summer outing

12:52.600 --> 12:54.834
at Pecan Sandy Beach.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.667
We got our best and brightest

12:56.734 --> 12:58.667
on the lookout.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.367
Ahh, num num num.

13:01.433 --> 13:04.800
Cookie Monster,
don't eat the sand.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.100
Yeah,
but Pecan Sandy Beach

13:06.166 --> 13:07.400
so delicious.

13:07.467 --> 13:09.567
Focus, Cookie Monster,

13:09.633 --> 13:11.934
because if The Crumb
somehow gets past us,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.133
well, that is a mess
I do not want to clean up.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.800
Uh, what Crumb
look like again?

13:16.867 --> 13:19.000
He looks like this.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.600
Oh, yeah. You know,

Figby: Aah! Don't touch
my sticky filling!

13:24.133 --> 13:25.767
- Cookie Monster!

13:25.834 --> 13:28.934
Focus... and watch out
for The Crumb.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.066
Me will do that.

13:30.133 --> 13:32.500
Yes, The Crumb
will never get by me.

13:32.567 --> 13:36.867
- OK. Let's see.

13:36.934 --> 13:38.500
- Pardon me.
- Yeah. Sorry.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.567
Oh, wait a minute!

13:39.633 --> 13:40.767
What?

13:40.834 --> 13:41.900
Me have to make sure

13:41.967 --> 13:42.900

13:42.967 --> 13:44.166

13:44.233 --> 13:46.233
Uh, same nose as Crumb,

13:46.300 --> 13:48.900
same eyes as Crumb...

13:48.967 --> 13:50.734
Something tell me
you The Crumb.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.200
Oh, don't be silly.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.500
I have, uh, crab claws.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.867

14:04.567 --> 14:05.767
Now, to mess up...

14:05.834 --> 14:08.533
Lady Crunchington's relaxing day

14:13.400 --> 14:14.734

14:30.133 --> 14:35.033
Whoa!

14:36.467 --> 14:37.600
Cookie Monster.

14:37.667 --> 14:38.800
Huh.

14:38.867 --> 14:39.900
You can't just run

14:39.967 --> 14:41.367
into a macaroon typhoon.

14:41.433 --> 14:44.633
You need to stop
and think it through.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.367
Yeah,
but how we get

14:46.433 --> 14:47.800
Lady Crunchington?

14:47.867 --> 14:49.734
Miss Fortune: Oh,
I'm getting a clue.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.767
If we want to get her
out of that water,

14:52.834 --> 14:54.633
we need some kind
of board.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.433

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

15:18.567 --> 15:20.533
