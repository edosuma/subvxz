00:08.258 --> 00:09.676
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale<i>:</i>

00:09.759 --> 00:13.263
Bringing the Southside
under control is my priority as mayor.

00:13.346 --> 00:17.392
If it means arresting
every single Serpent in sight, so be it.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.894
How many times
will we push each other away?

00:19.978 --> 00:20.854
Until it sticks.

00:21.730 --> 00:25.024
-You tried to rape me.
-You won't say anything to anyone.

00:25.108 --> 00:29.237
-There's a reason it's called hush money.
-Thank you for that, Mommy.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.947
Cheryl is telling the truth.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.743
-Nick tried to do it to me.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.746
-The St. Clairs had a car accident.
-Karma's a bitch.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.082
This is where we end this
and stop the Black Hood.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.127
-But right now I need you with me.
-Archie.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.881
I love you, too, Archie Andrews.

00:53.887 --> 00:57.891
<i>Know how there are some towns</i>
<i>where bad things always seem to happen?</i>

00:57.974 --> 01:01.519
<i>Well,</i>
<i>Riverdale has become one of those towns.</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:03.521
<i>The most recent horror?</i>

01:03.813 --> 01:06.983
<i>The school janitor turned out</i>
<i>to be a serial killer.</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:10.445
<i>But we were putting him away</i>
<i>along with our Christmas decorations.</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:14.866
<i>Now we were back</i>
<i>to your typical small-town intrigues.</i>

01:16.159 --> 01:19.120
<i>Clandestine meetings</i>
<i>behind closed doors and the like.</i>

01:19.996 --> 01:24.417
<i>Yes, by and large,</i>
<i>it was business as usual in Riverdale.</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:26.753
Good news, Cheryl.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.798
I've earned nearly enough
to pay for that tree

01:29.881 --> 01:32.425
and those ludicrous presents
you bought yourself.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.343
Bravo.

01:34.552 --> 01:38.598
Never mind that the last two weeks,
I've been living in a bordello with a...

01:38.681 --> 01:39.724
woman of the night.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.936
Well, it's not that different
from when I was younger

01:43.019 --> 01:46.523
and I had my pick of gentlemen callers
lining up every evening.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.400
Good God, you almost sound proud.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.028
You wanted me to get a job,
Cheryl, and I did.

01:52.403 --> 01:56.699
Providing comfort and companionship
to the lonely men of Riverdale.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.706
Veronica, have a minute?
-Just checking in.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.041
See how you're feeling.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.087
Ah. Checking to make sure
I'm on board with the "plan"?

02:09.879 --> 02:10.964
Don't worry, I am.

02:11.047 --> 02:14.467
-You're gonna be at ground zero.
-The eye of the potential hurricane.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.095
You said that when I wanted
to shop in SoHo

02:17.178 --> 02:19.180
during Occupy Wall Street,
and I was fine.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.183
-Uh...
-Dad, Mom, trust me.

02:22.767 --> 02:26.688
I'll keep my classmates from revolting.
And they'll be none the wiser.

02:33.236 --> 02:37.198
Hey, Arch, did you say anything to anybody
about my medical bill?

02:37.740 --> 02:42.996
Because it's been paid, all $86,000 of it.
Something called an angel donation.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.249
No. Well, I mean, Veronica,
but she wouldn't...

02:49.294 --> 02:50.211
-I'll ask her.
-No.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.381
I'll get to the bottom of it.
You just focus on school.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.468
-Haven't seen that guitar for a while.
-Yeah, well, I've been busy.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.222
I spent break writing songs.
I'll start a band like the Fred Heads.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.725
If you do,
do that in the garage.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.727
That's why I soundproofed it for you.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.912
-Ronnie.
-Hey.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.956
Hey, did you tell anyone
about my dad's hospital bill?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.625
Hmm. Did I?

03:28.708 --> 03:31.628
I may have mentioned it
to my mom and dad in passing.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.756
-Ronnie...
-They wanted to help.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.633
And they have the means to help.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.384
What, is your dad upset?

03:38.635 --> 03:39.469
Are you

03:42.222 --> 03:45.934
Ronnie...  I am crazy about you.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.699
<i>Students of</i>
<i>Riverdale High, this is your principal.</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:06.204
E-mails have been sent to your parents,
but effective immediately,

04:06.746 --> 04:08.957
<i>Southside High School is shut down.</i>

04:09.332 --> 04:12.961
<i>Its students will be transferred</i>
<i>to other schools in the district,</i>

04:13.044 --> 04:14.003
<i>including this one.</i>

04:14.545 --> 04:16.464
<i>I believe the statement we're releasing</i>

04:16.547 --> 04:19.926
-Guys, let's not overreact.
<i>-will address your concerns.</i>

04:20.009 --> 04:21.678
<i>You should receive it shortly.</i>

04:22.220 --> 04:25.598
-<i>I'm sure you have many questions.</i>
"

04:26.140 --> 04:27.267
<i>It goes without saying,</i>

04:27.350 --> 04:30.937
<i>we are welcoming these students</i>
<i>with open minds, hearts and arms.</i>

04:31.020 --> 04:32.897
-Hell, no.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.441
My home life is a Dickensian nightmare.

04:35.525 --> 04:39.779
-I won't have school turn into one, too.
-<i>This won't affect course schedules</i>

04:39.862 --> 04:41.281
<i>or locker assignments.</i>

04:41.364 --> 04:42.740
<i>Thank you. That is all.</i>

04:43.032 --> 04:44.951
Wait, what does that mean?

04:45.493 --> 04:48.746
-It means Jughead's coming back.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.457
Of course. We're fine.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.673
It's probably some bizarre,
byzantine town ordinance

04:58.756 --> 05:00.508
we couldn't possibly understand.

05:00.591 --> 05:05.096
In the meantime, let's receive the exiles
as if they were our own flesh and blood.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.558
Who's in

05:08.641 --> 05:12.145
Wow, Jones, props to you.
It's very Lovecraftian.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.689
Which I'm sure was the intention.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.942
But did you write this on a typewriter?

05:19.360 --> 05:22.697
Yeah, I wanted to
get into Lovecraft's headspace.

05:22.780 --> 05:27.368
So, it wasn't like Betty bought you
a typewriter for Christmas or anything?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.286
No comment.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.582
What's going on?

05:32.665 --> 05:35.835
This hellhole's officially closed.
No more Southside High.

05:35.918 --> 05:36.878
What

05:37.503 --> 05:40.840
It's gonna be quarantined.
We're going to different schools.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.551
This doesn't make sense.
Where are you guys going?

05:43.634 --> 05:48.389
Same as you, and you, and Fangs.
We're going to Riverdale High.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.852
Think of all those Northside heads
to knock.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.942
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.
Keep me posted.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.113
Well, it's done.

06:04.655 --> 06:08.701
Any minute my phone will start exploding
with calls from outraged parents.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.705
It'll be news for two days. Look how
people stopped talking about Black Hood.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.207
After a few weeks,

06:14.290 --> 06:18.086
we'll quietly go about purchasing
the land beneath Southside High.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.005
And you, Madam Mayor,
will get your commission.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.092
A sizable donation
to your re-election campaign.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.018
Mom

07:02.380 --> 07:04.090
All right, whoever you are...

07:04.507 --> 07:06.759
Betty, don't shoot. It's just me.

07:06.843 --> 07:11.347
Oh, my God. Polly, I almost pepper-sprayed
you. What are you doing home?

07:11.431 --> 07:15.476
-I just came to get a few things.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.395
-I had them, Betty.

07:20.022 --> 07:23.359
You didn't call us.
Mom will be crushed that she wasn't there.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.570
-We have to call her.
-No, Betty, we don't.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.448
Leaders of the Farm think
it's best if I sever all ties.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.826
The leaders of the Farm.
You mean the cult that you joined.

07:31.909 --> 07:35.538
It's not a cult. And on the Farm,
there's no stigma on my babies.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.416
-You can tell Mom and Dad.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.169
I don't know anything.
Do they have names?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.503
Juniper and Dagwood.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.299
Oh, my God. Polly, please, okay?

07:46.382 --> 07:48.259
Mom and Dad hurt you, yes,

07:48.342 --> 07:52.513
but what you're doing right now is cruel,
and selfish, and vindictive.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.224
I'm really sorry, Betty, but I gotta go.

07:56.434 --> 08:02.190
That's mine, by the way. The Farm
probably doesn't have electricity, anyway.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.495

08:15.578 --> 08:17.413

08:18.247 --> 08:19.165
Archie Andrews?

08:20.124 --> 08:22.502
I'm Special Agent Adams with the FBI.

08:23.753 --> 08:24.587
Hi.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.006
Can we take a walk?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.142
I always loved this park.
Came here every weekend.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.354
Played ball with my dad,
ran around with my dog.

08:41.437 --> 08:44.357
-I am. Born and raised.

08:44.857 --> 08:49.612
-That's why I was assigned this case.
Why do you need to talk to me?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.240
How well do you know Hiram Lodge?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.534
I date his daughter.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.663
We believe Hiram Lodge is conducting
criminal activity here in Riverdale

08:58.746 --> 09:00.331
with ties to organized crime.

09:00.414 --> 09:04.877
Between your relationship and your
father's connections to Lodge Industries,

09:04.961 --> 09:08.923
you're in a unique position to help us
take him down once and for all.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.718
-Mr. Lodge is a businessman.
-Let's talk about that.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.932
A few months ago, one of Hiram's
business associates came

09:18.015 --> 09:19.809
to visit with his family.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.018
The St. Clairs.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.605
They were going to invest
in Hiram's SoDale project,

09:24.689 --> 09:27.275
but for whatever reason,
the deal fell through.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.820
The St. Clairs went back to New York,
and their son, Nicholas,

09:31.320 --> 09:35.491
was soon admitted to Columbia-Presbyterian
with life-threatening injuries.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.744
-We do.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.914
-Veronica is my girlfriend.
-And her father

09:41.998 --> 09:44.542
is an extremely dangerous man.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.420
-He's hurt people, maybe worse.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.922
Find out what happened to Nick St. Clair.

09:50.006 --> 09:50.965
The truth.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.679
-Based on how you do on that assignment--
-I have not agreed to anything.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.849
Anyway, is this even legal,
what you're asking me to do?

10:00.641 --> 10:03.936
-He's in business with Lodge.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.023
For all we know,
he's part of Hiram's criminal activities.

10:07.106 --> 10:11.319
-Get real, my dad is not a part of this.
-We don't know that, not for sure.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.114
Maybe if you helped us,
we could be more certain.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.868
Look, I know it's a lot to take in.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.830
Think about it and call me.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.260
Well, that is one mystery solved.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.514
-Hiram and Hermione paid my hospital bill.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.560
-Dad, you can't accept that money.
-I already did.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.981
Traded 20 percent of Andrews Construction
to cover the 86 grand. A good deal.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.149
What? Dad, no.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.444
I can't take out another mortgage
on the house.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.030
Lodges will let me buy it back in pieces.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.449
But that just puts us in deeper with them.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.202
They just bailed me out of a jam.
What's the problem?

11:05.706 --> 11:09.543
Mayor McCoy's obviously hiding
something about this Southside debacle.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.465
-Schools don't just close overnight.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.513
-Mom, Polly...

11:21.055 --> 11:22.765
I've left messages to make sure

11:22.848 --> 11:26.685
she has everything she needs
and ask what color she wants the nursery.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.023
-I was wondering if you'd heard from her.
-No, not in a while.

11:34.068 --> 11:38.114
"Mayor McCoy has deemed Southside High
a public health hazard

11:38.197 --> 11:42.326
due to toxic fumes from
the methamphetamine lab in the basement."

11:43.869 --> 11:46.288
There was no meth, just Jingle-Jangle.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.583
So, the worm turns,
and it's back to Riverdale High, huh?

11:49.667 --> 11:54.171
-Something smells fishy.
-Damn straight, something smells fishy.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.299
The real reason you don't wanna go back.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.592
What do you mean?

12:00.428 --> 12:02.513
Oh, she just walked through the door.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.975
<i>Thanks for meeting with me.</i>

12:06.058 --> 12:07.393
Yeah, no problem.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.645
I was gonna reach out and clear the air

12:10.062 --> 12:14.442
before Dr. Beaker awkwardly pairs us up
in chemistry or something.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.486
Actually,
I wanted to meet because I need help.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.533
You remember that baby
my mom put up for adoption?

12:22.616 --> 12:24.869
Long lost Cooper sibling? Yeah.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.372
I was hoping you'd put me
in touch with your social worker

12:28.456 --> 12:31.375
to see if she can help me find him.

12:31.876 --> 12:37.631
Betty, of course I'll help,
but why the sudden need for a brother?

12:40.509 --> 12:41.886
Polly had the twins.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.306
She didn't even call my mom to tell her.

12:46.015 --> 12:51.645
I know my mom's crazy,
but she's also... really sad.

12:51.729 --> 12:56.358
So, maybe if she found her son,
having him in our lives...

12:58.194 --> 13:01.655
-I'll send you Ms. Weiss' number.
-Thank you, Jug.

13:01.739 --> 13:06.452
As for clearing the air, I'm happy
you'll be back at Riverdale High.

13:09.914 --> 13:14.043
Thank you for inviting me up.
-There's always room at our table.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.254
I wanted to say thanks for helping my dad.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.423
-We were happy to.
-He'd do the same.

13:19.507 --> 13:23.719
In return though,
I've put together a welcoming committee

13:23.802 --> 13:25.554
for tomorrow's arrivals,

13:25.638 --> 13:28.307
and I'm hoping
you'll stand by my side, Archie.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.268
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.024
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Lodge,
what about Southside High closing?

13:37.566 --> 13:41.070
It's close to the SoDale project.
Isn't that bad for business?

13:41.153 --> 13:45.032
Drugs, gangs and violence.
That's bad for business, Archie.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.200
Mm.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.453
So, investors
like the St. Clairs are fine with it?

13:51.247 --> 13:54.041
Archie, um,
the St. Clairs aren't investors anymore.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.209
Oh.

13:55.292 --> 13:59.421
-Not after what Nick did to Cheryl.
Did he get charged?

14:00.089 --> 14:04.802
We severed ties with the St. Clairs.
Don't think we called after the accident.

14:04.885 --> 14:05.719
Accident?

14:06.095 --> 14:09.056
Nick St. Clair had an accident driving,
um, in Vail.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.767
Or was it on the slopes?

14:12.476 --> 14:14.144
You know, I'm not sure.

14:17.147 --> 14:17.982
Is he...?

14:20.568 --> 14:21.610
Is he okay?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.321
Well, you know, from all reports,

14:24.405 --> 14:28.033
he's recovered enough to be back at, uh--
Was it Greenwich Prep?

14:28.117 --> 14:31.036
Yep.
-And may we never hear from him again.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.580
Mm.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.179

14:59.815 --> 15:04.945
Friends. On behalf of the students
and faculty here at Riverdale High,

15:05.029 --> 15:06.280
welcome to your new school.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.617
To ease this transition,
they've set up a registration desk

15:09.700 --> 15:14.371
where you can get locker assignments,
schedules and a list of extracurriculars.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.624
We encourage every one of you

15:16.707 --> 15:20.085
to drink deeply
from the cup that is fair Riverdale.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.671
Stand down, Eva Peron.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.183
There's the school spirit
I so fondly remember.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.651
Cheryl, no one invited Fascist Barbie
to the party.

15:43.734 --> 15:47.446
Wrong, Veronica. No one invited
Southside scum to our school.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.822
Listen up, ragamuffins.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.159
I will not allow
Riverdale High's GPA to suffer

15:52.242 --> 15:55.371
because of classrooms overcrowded
with underachievers.

15:55.454 --> 16:00.292
So, please, find some other school
to debase with your hardscrabble ways.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.253
Why don't you come over here
and say that to my face?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.966
-Happily, Queen of the Buskers.
-Okay, guys. Everyone.

16:07.508 --> 16:11.220
Can we put our Northside-Southside
differences apart and start over?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.889
-You don't speak for the Bulldogs.

16:13.973 --> 16:18.394
I remind you, these greaser-snakes
showed up at your place to kick your ass.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.187
Time to finish what we started.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.774
I am so over the toxic masculinity
in this hallway right now.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.235
All right, enough pomp and circumstance.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.862
Everyone, let's get to class. Now. You traitors picked the wrong side.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.332
Nice to see you with Veronica.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.045
Especially considering
that clandestine Christmas kiss

16:45.129 --> 16:46.755
between you and Betty Cooper.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.925
Care to reconsider your allegiance?

17:02.396 --> 17:03.230
Cheryl.

17:05.482 --> 17:10.112
I was unsurprised and pleased to get
your text suggesting this meeting, Archie.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.280
I'll keep it brief.

17:12.197 --> 17:16.035
If you don't convince Veronica
to stand against the Southside rabble,

17:16.118 --> 17:18.537
I'll tell her
I saw you kissing Betty Cooper.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.457
We were broken up,
and so were Jughead and Betty.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.126
That's not why I texted you.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.880
Oh, Archie, do you really think
you're going to outmaneuver me?

17:27.963 --> 17:29.590
I want to talk about Nick.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.386
What on earth for?

17:35.471 --> 17:38.682
Did you know that after he left,
he got into an accident?

17:38.766 --> 17:42.811
-Forgive me if I don't shed any tears.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.857
I only wish Mother and I
hadn't burned the check he gave us.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.029
You must've been thrilled, too,
when you found out.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.573
After what Nick did to Veronica
at his party.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.658
-When he got physical.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.205
-I mean, if Veronica hadn't slapped him,

18:01.580 --> 18:05.959
the same thing that happened to me
might have happened to her.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.672
-I am going to murder him.
-Archie...

18:12.424 --> 18:15.260
I genuinely thought you knew.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.389
It was Veronica's right
to tell you or not.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.019
I'm sure
there's a reason she kept it from you.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.314
Yeah, and I think I know what it is.

18:29.441 --> 18:34.696
As is typical, your brother's files
were made public when he turned 18.

18:35.572 --> 18:39.868
His name is Charles Smith.
After your mother gave birth,

18:39.952 --> 18:42.371
he entered,
and stayed in, the foster system.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.290
-Unfortunately, no.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.545
The last address we have for him
is two towns over, in Centerville.

18:52.881 --> 18:56.135
I don't think we've properly met.
Veronica Lodge.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.011
Of the Park Avenue Lodges.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.056
Toni Topaz.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.102
Oh, like the purple-colored gemstone.
Love it.

19:05.185 --> 19:09.314
And I'm Josie McCoy,
formerly of the Pussycats.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.525
Now just Josie.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.569
And this is Kevin.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.490
-Fogarty. Or you can call me Fangs.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.622
Joaquin and I used to hang out.
He talked about you all the time.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.960
You guys. Yes, you. Come with me.

19:30.919 --> 19:31.753
Now.

19:43.974 --> 19:47.436
Which of you defaced our school seal
with this graffiti?

19:48.478 --> 19:52.733
This is what they do,
Principal Weatherbee. They tag their turf.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.152
Reggie, could you be any more transparent?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.779
Effective immediately:

19:57.863 --> 20:01.241
No gang behavior of any kind
will be tolerated in my school.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.036
As of this moment,
no more Serpent jackets.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.329
-You're kidding.

20:05.412 --> 20:08.415
No more Serpent jackets.
All tattoos are gonna be covered.

20:08.498 --> 20:13.295
Possession of any gang paraphernalia
will lead to immediate suspension.

20:13.837 --> 20:14.671
Are we clear?

20:16.924 --> 20:17.966
That's all.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.805
Mom. Dad.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.353
Polly had the twins.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.980
-I don't understand.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.192
-She...
-I do. I understand.

20:35.275 --> 20:40.113
She didn't... Doesn't want us
to be a part of the babies' lives.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.660
Isn't that right, Betty?

20:46.495 --> 20:49.373
Well, are they healthy?
Is Polly all right?

20:49.456 --> 20:53.293
Yeah. She is. And they are.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.256
Good.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.550
There's something else.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.012
I did some digging,
and I found an address...

21:05.389 --> 21:06.348
for your son,

21:07.182 --> 21:08.183
my brother.

21:09.059 --> 21:13.522
-His name's Charles...

21:13.605 --> 21:16.733
What? I thought it might help,
now that Polly's--

21:16.817 --> 21:20.195
No.
This has nothing to do with Polly or you.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.156
-Okay, Hal--
-I did it for Mom, Dad.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.618
Mom?

21:29.746 --> 21:31.039
Your father's right.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.171
Okay.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.966
I can't believe you guys don't see it.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.343
Weatherbee is profiling us.

21:44.845 --> 21:49.558
Telling us what to wear. What's next?
Brain implants controlling what we think?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.810
You sound like a conspiracy nut.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.104
-A school closed down.
-A crappy school.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.317
Now we're at a better one,
with a computer lab and textbooks.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.860
And toilets that flush.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.988
Getting transferred
to Riverdale High is the best thing.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.072
Maybe ever.

22:04.156 --> 22:09.703
If I have to take off my jacket 8:30 to 3,
Monday to Friday, hey, I'm down with that.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.504
My dad soundproofed this,
so I could practice.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.506
Get back to it when this is over.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.302
-Yeah.

22:27.054 --> 22:31.433
Nick was hurt badly in some accident
in Vail,

22:31.516 --> 22:32.851
according to the Lodges.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.646
-But it may not be an accident.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.816
Before I say anything else,
I need assurance from you...

22:39.900 --> 22:44.154
that no matter what happens to Mr. Lodge,
my dad is not gonna go to jail.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.323
I can protect your father.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.327
Nick assaulted Veronica.

22:51.411 --> 22:54.081
-If Mr. Lodge found out...
-It'd give him a motive.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.833
Can you get confirmation
from his daughter?

22:56.917 --> 23:00.796
No way, I'm not using Veronica.
But I might be able to get to Nick.

23:01.338 --> 23:04.174
Smart.
He's more likely to talk to you than me.

23:04.257 --> 23:08.178
But what if he tells Veronica
I was asking about the accident?

23:08.261 --> 23:10.680
Or tells his parents
and they tell Mr. Lodge?

23:11.306 --> 23:12.766
You need a Trojan horse.

23:13.725 --> 23:18.688
A cover story. A reason to see Nick
that has nothing to do with the Lodges.

23:20.857 --> 23:25.070
-Maybe, yeah.

23:32.953 --> 23:33.954
What do you want?

23:34.037 --> 23:37.749
I can't stop thinking about
what Nick did to Veronica. And to you.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.544
Do you want another check from Nick?

23:41.086 --> 23:45.757
I mean, of course I'd take it, but...
I'm afraid the ship's sailed on that one.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.052
Really? Because I was thinking of going
to see Nick.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.097
I could ask him for you,
and I bet he'd give it to me.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.809
I need to borrow one of Jason's blazers.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.570
Mom?

24:09.906 --> 24:13.160
We can't tell your father,
because he wouldn't support it...

24:14.286 --> 24:15.996
but I want to see him, Betty.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.748
I want to see my son.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.131
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

24:29.718 --> 24:31.094

24:45.984 --> 24:48.236
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

24:52.115 --> 24:53.116
Take it off.

24:56.953 --> 25:00.081
Take off that jacket, rat boy.

25:04.085 --> 25:08.131
Oh, Reggie, I don't think you know
what this jacket means.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.052
Because you have no sense of honor,
or history or loyalty.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.345
That's it.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.350
-Get him.
Do it.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.103
Oh, my God.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.106
Mr. Weatherbee.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.068
You all have detention for fighting.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.991
But I made myself clear to you, Mr. Jones.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.369
Take off that jacket,
or you're suspended.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.288
-Please, Jughead, just--
-I guess I'm suspended.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.766
Weatherbee told McCoy, who told us,
integration is not going well.

25:59.849 --> 26:05.272
Reggie's just being Reggie,
but he has made gang-wear a flashpoint.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.400
The Southsiders need
to start looking the part.

26:09.067 --> 26:14.030
So, I propose a charitable donation,
to help out the fashionably misguided.

26:25.041 --> 26:25.875
Hi.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.879
Forty dollars a night for a single bed,
20 for a bunk.

26:29.963 --> 26:34.467
Oh, we're actually looking for someone.
His name's Charles Smith. Do you know him?

26:36.594 --> 26:37.429
237.

27:10.503 --> 27:11.504
It's okay, Mom.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.426
Come in.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.601
Charles? Charles.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.187
My name's Alice Cooper.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.231
This is my daughter, Betty.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.528
-We're... I'm--
-I know who you are.

27:37.238 --> 27:39.949
The sisters gave me your address
when I turned 18.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.035
When they kicked me out.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.121
I even went by your house.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.501
A nice place to grow up.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.922
You didn't want to come in

27:54.464 --> 27:57.133
You probably didn't want
somebody like me around.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.387
-That's not true.
-You're my sister.

28:02.889 --> 28:06.643
-Yeah. Yes.
-You're lucky she wanted to keep you.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.854
-Charles, I--
-It's Chic.

28:10.688 --> 28:14.067
But how would you know that?
You know what? Forget it.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.819
Go. I have a client on the way.

28:24.786 --> 28:25.954
Fantasy fulfillment.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.456
Now, really. Go.

28:30.875 --> 28:31.709
Come on, Mom.

29:08.538 --> 29:10.123
You break that, you buy it.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.753
-Hog Eye called.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.296
-FP.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.132
Explain why you're not in school.

29:19.674 --> 29:23.928
Yes. Weatherbee has been
disrespecting the Serpents.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.014
-He's been targeting us.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.891
He told us to take off our skins.

29:27.974 --> 29:31.519
You mean your jackets?
Wear them after school.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.522
-A Serpent never sheds his skin.
-I know the laws, boy.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.067
What's going on, Jug?

29:43.281 --> 29:46.993
At Southside High, we had a place.
Yeah, it was crappy,

29:47.076 --> 29:48.286
but it was ours.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.663
We were a family. We had a home.

29:51.915 --> 29:52.749
I had a home.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.626
Yeah, I hear you.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.465
But getting arrested for truancy's
not gonna help. Be smart.

30:01.674 --> 30:04.093
Serpents hibernate during the winter.

30:04.928 --> 30:09.140
Look at me. Think I like cleaning toilets?
Shoveling slop? No.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.434
But it's what I gotta do.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.771
Going to Riverdale High,
that's what you gotta do.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.902
So, lay low for a while,
but you never stop being a Serpent.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.081
Hey, Nick.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.041
Nice dorm room.

30:38.127 --> 30:42.549
What are you doing here?
And why are you wearing that blazer?

30:45.760 --> 30:49.556
You remember Cheryl Blossom?
You wrote her a check covering damages.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.768
Well, that check got lost.
So, you're gonna write it again.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.354
Right now. For double.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.816
That's it

31:01.442 --> 31:03.820
Checkbook's in the desk.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.703
You got hurt bad. How'd that happen? -Ski accident.

31:15.707 --> 31:20.920
Wow. You must really suck at skiing. So,
you wiped out and snapped both your legs?

31:22.630 --> 31:25.550
Yeah, I wiped out on the slopes.
What the hell do you care?

31:28.219 --> 31:31.306
-I don't care. I'm just curious.

31:31.806 --> 31:36.519
It's weird. You come to Riverdale,
act like a jackass, try to rape Cheryl,

31:36.603 --> 31:40.690
blow up some deal between the Lodges
and your folks, and skip back to Vail?

31:40.773 --> 31:44.527
For some little ski weekend?
I don't know, that seems weird.

31:46.779 --> 31:48.281
You're not here for Cheryl.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.451
Yes, I am.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.496
I'm here to get what you owe her,
you scumbag.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.416
I don't even remember
you being friends with Cheryl.

31:58.499 --> 32:02.086
-Probably because you were high, Nick.

32:03.838 --> 32:04.672
For Ronnie?

32:06.841 --> 32:11.012
Payback for what you did to Cheryl...
and Veronica.

32:11.095 --> 32:14.307
Payback? No.
No, you know what I think?

32:15.516 --> 32:17.352
I think you're a small-town hick

32:17.435 --> 32:21.189
who's realizing how deep
into shark-infested waters he really is.

32:22.857 --> 32:27.236
Careful. When Veronica Lodge smells blood,
she'll turn on you, too.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.925
What the hell

32:51.844 --> 32:53.680
Weatherbee gave them to us.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.849
Said he understood
that not every Southside student

32:56.933 --> 33:00.853
had the means to purchase
Riverdale High-acceptable clothes.

33:01.729 --> 33:03.940
He thinks this will help us fit in.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.150
-He wouldn't wear it.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.902
So, they suspended him.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.863
So our choices are conform or be cast out.

33:10.947 --> 33:11.823
Yeah.

33:17.453 --> 33:22.959
"FYI, your insane boyfriend
just ambushed me in my dorm room.

33:23.042 --> 33:26.254
He broke my nose
and was foaming at the mouth.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.048
-Hope you've had your shots."
-I can explain that.

33:29.132 --> 33:33.845
By all means, Archie, I would love to hear
why you went to New York behind my back

33:34.554 --> 33:36.723
and attacked Nick St. Clair.

33:36.806 --> 33:40.435
I wanted to beat him after what he did
to you after that party.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.938
Who told you about that?
The only people that know

33:44.022 --> 33:46.607
-are me, Nick, and--
I did.

33:48.484 --> 33:52.572
I told him. I told Archie the truth
about that staph-infection for a human.

33:53.573 --> 33:56.117
And I convinced him to pay Nick a visit.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.078
-Classic shakedown.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.750
I wanted money. Archie convinced Nick
reparations were in order.

34:05.835 --> 34:10.089
My only regret is that
I betrayed your confidence, Veronica.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.260
And for that, I'm sorry.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.348
Hey...

34:22.101 --> 34:23.102
I'm sorry, too.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.313
I should've told you.

35:00.973 --> 35:01.808
Hey.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.352
-Let go of him.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.480
I said, let go of my brother.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.233
Come on.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.284
Something's off with you.

35:20.868 --> 35:21.702
Huh?

35:21.786 --> 35:25.248
Call it girlfriend's intuition,
but you're hiding something.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.503
I wanted revenge
for what Nick did to you...

35:31.212 --> 35:32.880
That's true, okay? I swear.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.928
-But there is one thing I left out.
-I knew it.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.680
What?

35:42.515 --> 35:45.184
The reason I visited Nick
in the first place...

35:49.147 --> 35:50.773
Cheryl was blackmailing me.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.484
<i>Pardonne</i>

35:54.026 --> 35:56.320
-On the night of the Black Hood...

35:57.738 --> 35:58.573
Cheryl saw...

36:02.535 --> 36:04.120
Cheryl saw me and Betty kiss.

36:05.037 --> 36:08.082
What

36:08.166 --> 36:10.877
It was after you dumped me.
Jughead dumped Betty.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.505
Nana Rose told this story about
Betty's grandfather. It happened.

36:14.589 --> 36:17.508
You and Betty... kissed?

36:17.592 --> 36:19.927
It was that crazy night, Ronnie.

36:20.011 --> 36:23.764
Literally 40 minutes later,
the Black Hood was burying me alive.

36:26.684 --> 36:30.229
You and Betty... kissed.

36:31.147 --> 36:35.526
We haven't talked about it since.
I don't think we'll ever talk about it.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.373
It's okay.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.251
Do you know why?

36:52.335 --> 36:53.920
Because I believe you.

36:54.003 --> 36:57.840
You're being honest with me.
That's more important than a single...

36:59.258 --> 37:01.010
"my life is in danger" kiss.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.971
I love you, Ronnie.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.515
I love you, too.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.109
Mom I need help.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.778
Betty, what happened?

37:40.633 --> 37:44.178
Welcome to the inaugural meeting
of the Swords and Serpents Club.

37:44.262 --> 37:49.267
-Like I told Fogarty to lure him back...

37:49.350 --> 37:54.146
We are a gaming group,
sanctioned by Mr. Weatherbee, himself.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.148
Where like-minded students can meet

37:56.232 --> 37:59.735
and concoct world-building,
role-playing scenarios,

37:59.819 --> 38:05.283
inhabiting fantastical heroes
and dispatching mythological creatures.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.243
No, but really.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.704
It's a club. For us.

38:11.247 --> 38:16.294
A safe haven where we can be Serpents,
in school hours, under everyone's noses.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.712
We won't shed our skins.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.050
We're lying low, in the tall grass.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.264
I've solved all our problems, Mommy.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.146
Blood money from the St. Clairs.
And this time,

38:35.229 --> 38:38.899
you have my blessing to deposit it
in a bank, not in the fireplace.

38:40.693 --> 38:44.238
Aren't you glad?
Your days of being a courtesan are over.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.785
Mommy, I said you can stop.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.079
Oh, but Cheryl...

38:54.498 --> 38:56.042
Now, why would I stop...

38:58.044 --> 39:00.296
when I'm having such a good time?

39:07.803 --> 39:10.306
I know there's a lot to discuss
and sort out.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.809
But for now, try to get some rest, okay?

39:21.567 --> 39:22.568
Good night, Alice.

39:23.486 --> 39:26.405
-Good night, Hal.
-Good night, Chic.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.449
You'll be safe here.

39:49.929 --> 39:53.724
Why didn't you say anything...
about what happened with you and Nick?

39:54.600 --> 39:55.935
I felt foolish.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.398
For not seeing him for what he really was.

40:02.691 --> 40:04.610
Did you tell anyone besides Cheryl?

40:08.447 --> 40:10.282
Kevin, but that's it.

40:22.294 --> 40:24.338
<i>I asked for protection for my father.</i>

40:24.422 --> 40:28.968
I want it for Veronica, too.
I don't want her hurt or in trouble.

40:29.051 --> 40:32.638
Help us, and she
and your father are both off-limits.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.640
-Protected.
-I want that in writing.

40:34.723 --> 40:35.808
Absolutely.

40:35.891 --> 40:38.894
You can't get emotional again,
like you did with Nick.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.814
-You get emotional, you get sloppy.
-One more thing.

40:43.357 --> 40:46.569
If you've followed me around,
you must know about the Black Hood.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.779
I do. Nice job.

40:49.280 --> 40:54.535
In your expert opinion, Agent Adams,
do you think we got the right guy?

40:56.662 --> 40:58.706
I haven't told anyone about this...

41:00.332 --> 41:01.917
but I'm not so sure we did.

41:04.086 --> 41:07.965
<i>And so, Archie,</i>
<i>always trying to do the good, noble thing,</i>

41:08.048 --> 41:10.593
<i>took another step further into darkness.</i>

41:20.478 --> 41:23.689
<i>And Betty, the girl next door,</i>

41:23.772 --> 41:26.150
<i>had no sooner vanquished one monster...</i>
