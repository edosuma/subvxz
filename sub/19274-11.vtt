00:16.994 --> 00:18.838
- Previously on APB...
- _

00:18.863 --> 00:20.430
- Been a while.
- Danny...

00:20.455 --> 00:21.973
I go by DV8 now.

00:21.998 --> 00:23.219
I need some help.

00:23.244 --> 00:25.144
- What are you gonna do for me?
- I'll owe you a favor.

00:25.179 --> 00:27.118
You just have to dial a phone number.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.728
It turns out that that was
a lot more than just a favor.

00:30.753 --> 00:31.820
That call I made?

00:31.845 --> 00:33.879
It was to a cell phone
attached to a bomb.

00:33.914 --> 00:36.081
This is for you. I call it a crowbar.

00:36.116 --> 00:37.315
Just plug it into the district servers,

00:37.351 --> 00:39.044
it'll pry open an encrypted backdoor.

00:39.069 --> 00:41.045
- I'm not doing that.
- Yes, you are.

00:41.077 --> 00:43.468
Somebody's got bad
blood with Danny Reghabi.

00:43.493 --> 00:45.067
Do you want to help me
out, get him off my back?

00:45.092 --> 00:46.758
Danny's an unstable young man.

00:46.794 --> 00:48.360
Come on, all I need is
a little information.

00:48.395 --> 00:49.964
Have you heard of a hacker collective

00:49.989 --> 00:51.130
by the name of CommandALT?

00:51.165 --> 00:52.564
Danny's set up shop with them.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.600
Get something they don't
want shared with the world.

00:54.635 --> 00:55.926
Be careful.

00:57.827 --> 00:59.176
What the hell was that?

00:59.201 --> 01:00.606
Cut the power! Shut down!

01:00.641 --> 01:03.375
Evidence of money
laundering and tax evasion.

01:03.410 --> 01:05.043
Why don't I just kill you?

01:05.078 --> 01:07.813
This information is
randomly set to auto-send.

01:07.848 --> 01:09.314
- This isn't over.
- It better be.

01:09.350 --> 01:11.835
Otherwise you'll be writing your
manifesto on a cell block wall.

01:11.860 --> 01:13.562
Seven years ago, when
you hacked my company,

01:13.587 --> 01:14.853
I knew you had a past.

01:14.888 --> 01:16.688
- I'll see you on Monday.
- Okay.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.654
Hello, everyone.

02:28.996 --> 02:30.462
Glad you all could make it.

02:30.497 --> 02:32.064
I'd make introductions,

02:32.099 --> 02:36.364
but I think probably best we
keep this a no-names type thing.

02:36.607 --> 02:40.422
Now, then, if everybody's ready,
we've got a lot of work to do.

02:40.447 --> 02:41.492
Yeah.

02:41.517 --> 02:44.798
Before we get down to
business, we got to talk terms.

02:44.823 --> 02:46.078
Terms?

02:46.103 --> 02:47.234
Yeah.

02:47.259 --> 02:49.090
Word is, this isn't just any job.

02:49.115 --> 02:51.150
From what I hear, we're
going up against the cops.

02:51.175 --> 02:54.409
So I'm thinking it's
time to renegotiate.

02:54.434 --> 02:55.959
Yeah.

02:55.984 --> 02:57.551
I heard the same thing.

02:57.790 --> 02:59.957
Way I see it, that's
worth at least double.

03:01.526 --> 03:03.227
We had an agreement.

03:06.306 --> 03:07.898
Hey! Hey...

03:09.691 --> 03:12.024
Anyone else feel like haggling?

03:13.439 --> 03:14.923
Okay, then.

03:16.345 --> 03:18.017
Let's get started.

03:21.356 --> 03:26.031
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

03:26.217 --> 03:27.286
- Okay.
- Here you go.

03:27.311 --> 03:29.089
I just think that you
need to see this now.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.236
Ada, I think people are a little unclear

03:31.261 --> 03:32.761
on how this is supposed to work.

03:32.786 --> 03:36.655
So, at Reeves Aerospace, is
there sometimes an issue with,

03:36.690 --> 03:39.534
say, a rivet in one of the planes? Yes.

03:39.559 --> 03:41.893
But dealing with the individual
rivets? That's not my job.

03:41.928 --> 03:43.261
I design the systems, right?

03:43.297 --> 03:44.902
I'm fully aware of this, Gideon.

03:44.927 --> 03:47.409
Well, you say that, yeah, but
you drag me up from the workshop

03:47.434 --> 03:50.402
to examine an APB call, aka a rivet.

03:50.437 --> 03:52.704
All right, but it's
not just an APB call.

03:52.739 --> 03:54.072
You're the target.

03:54.107 --> 03:55.184
She's right, Gideon.

03:55.209 --> 03:56.675
This came in ten minutes ago.

03:56.710 --> 03:57.809
An online video was posted,

03:57.844 --> 03:59.721
and we've been getting
calls from all over the city.

03:59.746 --> 04:00.845
Play it for him.

04:02.015 --> 04:04.018
Weaponized drones.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.059
Warrantless surveillance.

04:07.543 --> 04:09.770
Militarized cops.

04:09.795 --> 04:12.762
This is not some distant
future you are looking at.

04:12.787 --> 04:15.327
It is reality on the streets of Chicago.

04:15.362 --> 04:18.630
An unelected fascist technocrat,
accountable to no one,

04:18.654 --> 04:21.856
has trampled rights and
declared war on this city.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.635
His name is Gideon Reeves.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.837
He's a guy with a lot of secrets.

04:25.872 --> 04:28.901
And today those secrets come out.

04:28.926 --> 04:30.642
Are you ready?

04:30.677 --> 04:33.629
Because I've got some
big surprises waiting.

04:33.654 --> 04:37.489
I am coming for you.

04:44.191 --> 04:46.691
I don't know. I'm not
really feeling the terror.

04:46.727 --> 04:48.727
You know, why not go evil clown?

04:48.762 --> 04:50.124
That would be...

04:50.149 --> 04:52.778
Guys, this is a kid that's trolling us.

04:52.803 --> 04:54.566
I don't know about that, Gideon.

04:54.601 --> 04:55.900
This seems serious to me.

04:55.936 --> 04:57.202
And it's not just the video,

04:57.237 --> 04:59.771
there's all this chatter
on activist Web sites.

04:59.806 --> 05:02.694
It seems they have something
really big planned for today.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.976
I checked in with some
other district captains.

05:05.011 --> 05:06.653
They're getting the same reports.

05:06.678 --> 05:09.037
Telling you, everyone's
gonna feel pretty silly

05:09.062 --> 05:10.895
when we trace his I.P. address

05:10.930 --> 05:12.272
and find him in his mom's basement.

05:12.297 --> 05:13.819
Yeah, I already tried that.

05:13.866 --> 05:15.763
He's using a proxied
I.P., and it's bouncing.

05:15.788 --> 05:17.755
He clearly knows what he's doing.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.612
Here's the thing, Gideon.

05:19.647 --> 05:20.921
I talked it over with Murphy,

05:20.946 --> 05:24.061
I think it's best if you're
not in the station today.

05:24.668 --> 05:27.085
What? You're sending me home?

05:27.381 --> 05:28.573
Are you...?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.519
He's in a goofy mask.

05:31.544 --> 05:34.464
He uses the word "technocrat,"

05:34.488 --> 05:37.158
like some 1970s sociology professor.

05:37.183 --> 05:38.197
It's a joke.

05:38.222 --> 05:39.441
Until we know for sure,

05:39.466 --> 05:41.152
I'm erring on the side of caution.

05:41.177 --> 05:42.394
People are worried.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.691
Mr. Reeves?

05:45.366 --> 05:47.855
Mayor Salgado on line one
for you and the captain.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.746
Oh, great. We go from
nutjob to whack job.

05:52.940 --> 05:55.300
Mr. Mayor! Always a pleasure.

05:55.348 --> 05:56.611
What can I do you for?

05:56.646 --> 05:58.213
Yeah, well you can
start out by telling me

05:58.248 --> 05:59.614
what the hell is going on here.

05:59.649 --> 06:00.949
I've been getting calls all morning

06:00.984 --> 06:02.528
about some kind of terrorist threat.

06:02.553 --> 06:04.240
Terrorist? No.

06:04.265 --> 06:06.589
- That's a little bit much.
- That so?

06:06.623 --> 06:09.157
Yeah, I've already dodged
three local news outlets

06:09.192 --> 06:10.683
fishing around for a story here.

06:10.708 --> 06:12.566
Now, if this thing goes sideways,

06:12.591 --> 06:14.305
guess who I'm putting
in front of the cameras.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.625
I assure you, we can
handle the situation.

06:17.650 --> 06:19.836
Yeah, well, I suggest
you do that quickly, then,

06:19.868 --> 06:21.390
because if this thing blows up,

06:21.415 --> 06:24.650
if anyone gets hurt, it's your ass,

06:24.685 --> 06:26.717
and your entire district.

06:27.342 --> 06:28.717
Oh, there he goes.

06:31.132 --> 06:33.099
I'm gonna have Murphy take you home.

06:33.124 --> 06:35.249
It's too risky having
you here at the station.

06:35.274 --> 06:36.382
You're not serious.

06:36.407 --> 06:38.997
You think that I'm scared of
some masked loser out there?

06:39.022 --> 06:41.694
- This isn't the first time...
- This is not just about you.

06:41.719 --> 06:43.216
If this threat is for real,

06:43.241 --> 06:45.037
having you here puts cops in danger.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.272
Um, have you seen the
ops center out there?

06:47.308 --> 06:49.408
Bunch of computers,
big map, drone controls?

06:49.443 --> 06:51.319
All stuff that I put in to fight crime.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.112
Don't you think I
could do more good here?

06:54.148 --> 06:57.450
Right now, what matters
is this: you're a target.

06:57.475 --> 07:00.586
Sending you home with Murphy
is the safest thing for you

07:00.611 --> 07:02.624
and for the station.

07:02.649 --> 07:04.500
You made me the captain.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.765
Don't argue when I make a call.

07:10.301 --> 07:12.225
I want to be clear here.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.944
We're not sure that
anything is gonna happen.

07:14.979 --> 07:17.579
But we're treating this
as a credible threat.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.637
We're putting every resource on this.

07:19.662 --> 07:20.928
- What about Gideon?
- He's at home,

07:20.953 --> 07:22.519
with a protective detail,

07:22.544 --> 07:24.664
for his own safety and for ours.

07:24.689 --> 07:26.768
Now, we split the
district into sections.

07:26.793 --> 07:29.510
Your assignments will
be sent to your cars.

07:29.535 --> 07:32.746
Keep your eyes open wide
for anything unusual.

07:33.128 --> 07:34.590
Let's get out there.

07:42.175 --> 07:43.433
Hey.

07:44.021 --> 07:45.463
You all right?

07:45.488 --> 07:49.160
Last time I saw a guy in a
mask sending out threat videos,

07:49.185 --> 07:50.910
I was in a different uniform.

07:50.935 --> 07:52.441
This isn't Ramadi, Brandt.

07:52.466 --> 07:54.012
Exactly my point.

07:54.037 --> 07:56.838
A guy steals a TV, sells some drugs,

07:56.863 --> 07:59.691
I don't like his career
choice but I get it.

08:00.156 --> 08:01.402
But this?

08:01.605 --> 08:02.704
Who does this?

08:02.729 --> 08:04.259
It's not our job to understand the guy.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.574
Just bust him. Come on, let's go.

08:06.599 --> 08:07.816
Come on.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.316
No one respects the
captain more than I do,

08:22.341 --> 08:23.788
but if I have to hide in a hole

08:23.813 --> 08:26.446
'cause of every badly
produced Internet video,

08:26.578 --> 08:28.407
haven't the terrorists already won?

08:28.432 --> 08:30.399
I would hardly call this a hole.

08:30.496 --> 08:32.897
You have this place out
here and a penthouse?

08:32.922 --> 08:35.179
Yeah. And, like, six
other places. Or seven?

08:35.205 --> 08:36.304
I don't know, I lost count.

08:36.328 --> 08:38.830
No, the penthouse,
that's just a party place.

08:39.076 --> 08:42.010
I got that after Tyson
spilled beer on a Da Vinci.

08:42.034 --> 08:43.868
- Mike Tyson?
- Neil deGrasse.

08:43.893 --> 08:46.446
Astronomers and alcohol.

08:46.471 --> 08:48.297
Bad combination.

08:49.748 --> 08:53.752
Hey, that guy in the video said
that you like to keep secrets.

08:53.777 --> 08:54.969
Like he had something on you.

08:54.994 --> 08:57.655
Best not to rely on guys
playing dress-up on the internet

08:57.680 --> 08:59.641
for reliable intelligence.

09:01.476 --> 09:03.885
I-I don't have any idea what
he's talking about, Murph.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.353
Guy's crazy.

09:13.203 --> 09:14.656
Hey, that's Havana.

09:14.681 --> 09:16.468
Since when do you like Cuban music?

09:16.493 --> 09:17.929
I don't. But you do.

09:17.961 --> 09:21.350
My smart home uses facial recognition

09:21.375 --> 09:22.858
to identify people I know.

09:22.883 --> 09:24.281
And then it's programmed...

09:24.306 --> 09:27.984
to customize art and
music to their tastes.

09:28.492 --> 09:29.922
That's bananas.

09:29.957 --> 09:32.624
Uh, actually, I'm pretty
sure those are plantains.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.015
What does it play for you?

09:35.062 --> 09:36.578
Home, please?

09:37.424 --> 09:40.492
- ♪ Ground Control to Major Tom... ♪
- Huh?

09:40.517 --> 09:42.468
Buzz Aldrin and "Space Oddity"?

09:42.508 --> 09:44.975
I mean, what's better than that?

09:46.056 --> 09:47.312
Uh, Gideon?

09:48.377 --> 09:50.624
Gertrude, this is Murphy. Don't worry.

09:50.649 --> 09:51.718
She's with me.

09:52.767 --> 09:56.396
♪ Take your protein pills
and put your helmet on... ♪

09:56.421 --> 09:58.601
Uh-huh. There you go.

09:59.421 --> 10:01.458
She gets jealous of new people.

10:01.493 --> 10:03.492
- Really?
- No.

10:03.611 --> 10:04.861
She's a machine.

10:05.030 --> 10:08.250
But she does happen to be the
first robot that I ever built.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.434
Did QC at my first aerospace factory.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.365
Replaced a whole department.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.839
And how did that go over with
the department that got axed?

10:15.874 --> 10:18.358
There were a few picket lines, but, uh,

10:18.383 --> 10:20.789
the polio vaccine killed
the leg brace industry,

10:20.814 --> 10:23.759
and I don't see people
demanding more polio these days.

10:23.784 --> 10:27.086
Says the guy who's hiding in
his house from angry protesters.

10:27.962 --> 10:29.795
I know you are, but what am I?

10:30.289 --> 10:31.388
Gideon.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.923
Show me your security system.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.791
♪ This is Ground Control to Major Tom ♪

10:34.816 --> 10:35.968
♪ You... ♪

10:37.369 --> 10:39.570
Fallujah was no picnic.

10:39.996 --> 10:43.921
You'd drive around for hours
without so much as a peep.

10:44.303 --> 10:47.604
And then, boom, out of nowhere.

10:48.086 --> 10:50.073
I don't know what's worse,

10:50.108 --> 10:53.643
the waiting or when
something actually happens.

10:53.679 --> 10:55.912
Well, might be just me,

10:55.948 --> 11:00.312
but the waiting sounds a hell
of a lot better than "boom."

11:01.793 --> 11:03.188
Is it you, Danny?

11:03.213 --> 11:05.304
Please tell me you're not behind this.

11:07.398 --> 11:08.692
Ada.

11:09.523 --> 11:11.140
Any progress finding this guy?

11:11.165 --> 11:12.714
No, he's using proxies,

11:12.739 --> 11:14.851
randomized nodes to bounce the signal.

11:14.876 --> 11:17.359
Uh, when you're on the Internet,
you leave a digital footprint,

11:17.384 --> 11:18.846
and this guy is just...

11:18.871 --> 11:21.404
really good at erasing his footprint.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.023
Oh, awesome. We have
some incoming APB calls.

11:24.048 --> 11:25.271
What is it?

11:25.296 --> 11:28.197
A disturbance at 2621 Waring Boulevard.

11:28.785 --> 11:29.965
Waring?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.847
That's a city services building.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.996
Yeah, some kind of a terror threat.

11:39.113 --> 11:40.683
Look what they have on.

11:40.708 --> 11:42.238
Those masks are just like the ones

11:42.263 --> 11:43.816
we saw in the video.

11:48.647 --> 11:50.699
I don't like the look of this.

11:54.072 --> 11:56.543
1305, suspicious persons gathering

11:56.568 --> 11:58.863
at 2621 Waring Boulevard.

11:58.888 --> 12:00.110
Possible explosives.

12:00.145 --> 12:02.212
1305, Squad. Responding.

12:02.247 --> 12:04.206
Sounds like the wait's over.

12:04.231 --> 12:06.074
- Happy now?
- No.

12:06.704 --> 12:08.074
No, I'm not.

12:11.176 --> 12:14.272
Okay, uh, here's my security room.

12:14.307 --> 12:15.824
Front of the house,

12:15.849 --> 12:17.207
south side,

12:17.232 --> 12:18.290
north side,

12:18.315 --> 12:19.362
back.

12:19.387 --> 12:20.527
Who's monitoring all this?

12:20.535 --> 12:21.667
Oh, it's automatic.

12:21.703 --> 12:22.802
The data feeds are processed

12:22.837 --> 12:25.271
by an artificial neural network.

12:25.306 --> 12:27.340
The whole house is wired, actually.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.075
Lights, stereo, plumbing.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.109
- Plumbing?
- What?

12:30.145 --> 12:31.770
What, are you gonna flush the
toilet from across the house?

12:31.795 --> 12:33.447
All right, you scoff.

12:33.472 --> 12:37.189
The first transistor was made
years before the computer.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.423
You make something cool, a use shows up.

12:42.423 --> 12:45.032
- Hey, are you expecting a delivery?
- No.

12:45.057 --> 12:48.528
I mean, Elon Musk still sends
a bag of quarters every month

12:48.574 --> 12:50.140
since I bad-mouthed PayPal,

12:50.165 --> 12:51.312
but those came last Monday.

12:51.337 --> 12:52.553
Gideon, this isn't funny.

12:52.578 --> 12:53.868
This could be trouble.

12:54.923 --> 12:56.656
Are you sure?

12:57.005 --> 12:59.234
Guys in masks with automatic weapons

12:59.259 --> 13:00.634
on your front porch?

13:00.659 --> 13:01.837
I'm positive.

13:06.971 --> 13:08.104
Yes, sir.

13:08.309 --> 13:09.512
All right, folks, let's go.

13:09.537 --> 13:11.455
- Come on, right this way.
- Let's go.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.010
Let's go, clear the building.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.424
Get across the street.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.696
1305, Squad.

13:17.721 --> 13:19.516
Be advised, we're arriving at the scene.

13:19.541 --> 13:20.840
1305,

13:20.876 --> 13:23.947
six masked individuals were
seen entering the building

13:23.972 --> 13:25.166
with backpacks.

13:25.191 --> 13:26.978
Security's cleared everybody out,

13:27.010 --> 13:28.877
but we still don't know
what we're dealing with.

13:28.912 --> 13:32.347
Approach from the north
entrance with extreme caution.

13:37.688 --> 13:39.180
Oh, hey.

13:40.023 --> 13:41.383
Look.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.438
There's the boom we talked about.

13:44.728 --> 13:46.327
This is above our pay grade.

13:46.363 --> 13:49.069
All right, you call it in, I'll
start talking to the witnesses.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.633
1305, Squad. Are you seeing this?

13:51.826 --> 13:53.626
Yeah, copy that, 1305.

13:53.651 --> 13:55.284
Wish we didn't, but we do.

13:58.241 --> 13:59.407
I need the bomb squad

13:59.443 --> 14:01.320
to 2621 Waring Boulevard.

14:01.345 --> 14:02.611
I need them fast.

14:04.081 --> 14:06.704
Or this day's about to
get a whole lot worse.

14:10.086 --> 14:11.149
1309, Squad.

14:11.174 --> 14:13.921
We have three armed assailants
approaching Gideon's house.

14:13.946 --> 14:15.523
We need backup now.

14:15.548 --> 14:16.914
Come in, Squad!

14:16.950 --> 14:18.954
Phone lines are down. Looks like

14:18.979 --> 14:20.977
they're jamming radio signals.

14:23.532 --> 14:25.634
- How strong is that door?
- It's reinforced,

14:25.659 --> 14:26.857
but it's meant to resist,

14:26.893 --> 14:29.293
you know, burglars,
not an assault force.

14:29.329 --> 14:30.969
How do these guys know you're here?

14:30.994 --> 14:32.360
No idea, Murph.

14:32.961 --> 14:34.022
Okay, go hide.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.219
I'm gonna hold them off.

14:35.244 --> 14:38.369
So, as exciting as you taking
on three guys with assault rifles

14:38.404 --> 14:39.603
in my living room sounds,

14:39.639 --> 14:41.602
I have a room that we can both hide in.

14:41.627 --> 14:42.959
Gideon, we have to hold them off.

14:42.984 --> 14:44.750
I'll do the fighting,
you do the freaking.

14:44.775 --> 14:45.974
You think that'll help?

14:45.999 --> 14:47.198
You're gonna get
yourself killed, Murphy.

14:47.223 --> 14:49.857
And me, too, for whatever that's worth.

14:50.336 --> 14:51.868
All right, we don't have much time.

14:51.893 --> 14:53.227
You got to trust me on this one.

14:56.389 --> 14:57.621
We're hiding in here?

14:57.657 --> 14:59.857
I joined Mensa before I
could drive a car, Murphy.

14:59.892 --> 15:02.374
I'm smart enough to know
we can't hide under a desk.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.225
What is that?

15:07.250 --> 15:08.766
A secret lab.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.764
"Secret" being the operative word

15:11.789 --> 15:13.063
at the moment.

15:23.252 --> 15:26.707
Bomb squad's suiting
up, but listen, Cap?

15:27.361 --> 15:29.795
This doesn't feel like your
garden-variety bomb threat.

15:29.830 --> 15:32.131
Safe to assume this is the
surprise we were promised.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.496
1305, what about suspects?

15:34.521 --> 15:37.297
My gut says they ditched
their clothes and masks,

15:37.738 --> 15:40.169
blended in with what's
left of the crowd.

15:40.194 --> 15:42.190
We're looking at a few
possibles right now.

15:42.215 --> 15:43.381
Good chances they're just here

15:43.406 --> 15:44.939
hanging with the lookie-loos.

15:46.644 --> 15:47.677
Stand by, Squad.

15:47.702 --> 15:48.897
Hey.

15:49.605 --> 15:51.525
Check the guy with the hoodie.

15:52.940 --> 15:54.828
- Which one?
- He's over there, he's...

15:56.490 --> 15:57.811
He was just right there.

15:58.414 --> 15:59.764
Not anymore.

16:00.029 --> 16:01.228
Damn it.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.554
Squad, Goss and I are
gonna take a look around.

16:03.579 --> 16:05.403
Copy that, 1305.

16:05.428 --> 16:06.794
Keep us posted.

16:11.212 --> 16:13.691
All right, so, we can stay
down here as long as we need to.

16:13.716 --> 16:14.888
That door is reinforced.

16:14.913 --> 16:16.146
Well, we can't just wait.

16:16.181 --> 16:17.847
Whatever this is, is a
part of something bigger.

16:17.883 --> 16:19.270
We need to contact the station.

16:19.295 --> 16:20.394
All right, all right, all right.

16:20.429 --> 16:21.710
I can message Ada, yeah.

16:21.735 --> 16:23.301
Contact everybody that you can.

16:23.326 --> 16:24.536
We need SWAT team down here,

16:24.561 --> 16:26.433
we may even need a heavy weapons truck.

16:33.497 --> 16:34.696
God...

16:35.074 --> 16:36.186
What?

16:36.211 --> 16:37.466
What is it?

16:37.491 --> 16:39.239
They took out the Internet.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.917
Wireless, fiber-optic, yeah, all down.

16:41.942 --> 16:43.384
Okay, well, there has to
be something that we can use

16:43.419 --> 16:44.418
down here with all this stuff.

16:44.453 --> 16:46.553
Well, could I build a radio tower

16:46.589 --> 16:48.488
powerful enough to get
through the jamming?

16:48.513 --> 16:50.413
Yeah, maybe in, like, a few hours.

16:53.195 --> 16:55.434
Gideon, I don't think
we have a few hours.

17:01.066 --> 17:02.736
I thought you said
this was a secret lab.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.021
As in, nobody knows about it.

17:04.046 --> 17:06.317
Well, all evidence would suggest

17:06.342 --> 17:08.502
that somebody else knows my secret.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.713
I mean, it's not like I had the place
built by magic robot elves, okay?

17:11.738 --> 17:13.079
If someone was really determined,

17:13.115 --> 17:14.548
and it appears that someone was,

17:14.583 --> 17:17.064
then obviously they could figure it out.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.786
All right, how much time
do you think we have?

17:18.820 --> 17:20.786
From the sound of that
drill, probably not very long.

17:20.810 --> 17:22.344
Visitors... are you expecting anybody?

17:22.378 --> 17:24.311
Not big on socializing at home, Murphy.

17:24.348 --> 17:25.477
That's what the penthouse is for.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.549
Okay, so nobody's here besides you?

17:26.574 --> 17:28.435
I mean, a housekeeper comes Thursday.

17:28.460 --> 17:29.490
I don't know what you want.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.634
I'm a billionaire, I
don't have roommates!

17:37.224 --> 17:39.553
Yep. Take that.

17:39.578 --> 17:41.258
Okay, okay, okay, here.

17:41.283 --> 17:43.431
Uh, help me get this off.

17:43.538 --> 17:45.237
Uh, why? What for?

17:45.273 --> 17:48.541
I just realized there is
someone else in the house:

17:48.696 --> 17:49.828
Gertrude.

17:59.009 --> 18:00.438
_

18:05.425 --> 18:07.453
And about how long would you
say they were in the building?

18:07.478 --> 18:09.578
I saw them come in, word got around,

18:09.613 --> 18:11.213
and we just started clearing out.

18:11.248 --> 18:12.843
I-I didn't stick around
to find out what happened.

18:12.868 --> 18:14.835
Okay, well, was there
anybody unfamiliar to you

18:14.860 --> 18:16.136
that left in that group?

18:16.172 --> 18:18.365
Tons of people. It's a big building.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.441
Hey, I got multiple APB reports

18:20.476 --> 18:22.242
on suspicious individuals
driving in the district.

18:22.278 --> 18:24.678
More of them? Where?
Are they in one area?

18:24.703 --> 18:26.069
Yeah, I'm bringing them up now.

18:26.104 --> 18:28.238
Okay, so this is the
first batch of calls.

18:29.217 --> 18:30.717
This is a minute later.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.942
And then this is 30 seconds after that.

18:34.157 --> 18:35.378
Those cars.

18:35.403 --> 18:37.256
Am I crazy, or are they all...?

18:37.281 --> 18:39.092
Headed straight towards the station.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.361
We're talking about anyone

18:40.396 --> 18:42.171
who was actually involved.

18:42.196 --> 18:44.665
- I can't say...
- 1305, multiple reports

18:44.701 --> 18:45.946
of suspicious vehicles

18:45.971 --> 18:47.523
inbound toward the station.

18:47.548 --> 18:49.103
Request immediate assistance.

18:49.138 --> 18:50.200
Thank you.

18:54.952 --> 18:57.811
1305, Squad, what are we looking at?

18:57.836 --> 19:00.250
Sending you video from
multiple APB users now.

19:00.275 --> 19:02.174
More men in red masks.

19:02.199 --> 19:03.219
What the hell?

19:03.244 --> 19:04.855
Any idea what they're doing?

19:04.880 --> 19:07.013
Nope, just that they're headed
straight towards the station

19:07.038 --> 19:08.197
and fast.

19:08.222 --> 19:11.450
All right, well, in that case,
let's give them a warm welcome.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.748
What is all that?

19:16.773 --> 19:19.040
It's the guts of my smart home.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.766
This connects us to everything.

19:20.808 --> 19:24.007
House controls, cameras, most of all...

19:24.113 --> 19:25.175
Gertrude.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.314
What's a robot gonna do? Beep at them?

19:27.349 --> 19:28.715
No, she's gonna call the station for us.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.429
If we can get her outside
the range of their jamming,

19:31.454 --> 19:33.726
might be able to get a
message to the district, right?

19:33.751 --> 19:35.317
Do you really think that could work?

19:35.346 --> 19:36.926
Um, if I had to hazard a guess,

19:36.951 --> 19:38.851
I would say we just went from doomed...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.799
to, like, ten percent less doomed.

19:41.824 --> 19:42.856
I'll take that.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.303
Cool, so...

19:44.328 --> 19:46.130
splice that wire for me.

19:52.398 --> 19:53.931
Hey, tell me something,

19:53.956 --> 19:56.471
you have dozens of labs at your company.

19:56.784 --> 19:58.574
Why do you need a secret one?

19:58.609 --> 20:00.162
Special projects.

20:00.187 --> 20:01.253
You know.

20:01.278 --> 20:03.174
No, actually, I don't know.

20:03.199 --> 20:04.601
What do you do here that you can't...?

20:04.626 --> 20:05.731
Okay, so why don't we save

20:05.756 --> 20:08.156
the philosophical discussion
about research transparency

20:08.181 --> 20:09.594
for later, and,

20:09.619 --> 20:12.307
and for now focus on not dying?

20:16.409 --> 20:17.712
Okay.

20:17.909 --> 20:19.914
All right, Gertie.

20:20.388 --> 20:22.236
Time to save Daddy.

20:23.749 --> 20:25.709
_

20:28.628 --> 20:31.434
1305, you're on course to intercept

20:31.459 --> 20:33.543
suspect vehicle at 54th and Lake.

20:33.568 --> 20:35.397
- Keep your eyes open.
- Copy that, Squad.

20:35.422 --> 20:37.088
Anything more on a make or model?

20:37.113 --> 20:38.777
You're looking for a
four-door red sedan,

20:38.802 --> 20:40.015
that's all we know.

20:40.050 --> 20:41.320
This ain't right.
We're missing something.

20:41.345 --> 20:43.313
Yeah, we're missing
a red four-door sedan.

20:43.338 --> 20:44.396
Nah.

20:44.421 --> 20:46.214
We got half our guys on a bomb call,

20:46.242 --> 20:48.751
the other half are chasing guys
with masks across the district.

20:48.776 --> 20:50.876
It's like they're waving
a red flag in one hand

20:50.912 --> 20:53.284
and slipping us a Mickey with the other.

20:53.309 --> 20:54.584
There's another move coming.

20:54.609 --> 20:55.625
I can feel it.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.016
There. You see that?

20:57.052 --> 20:58.465
A red sedan.

20:58.809 --> 20:59.942
Son of a bitch.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.387
That guy, he was at the building!

21:01.423 --> 21:03.287
1305, Squad, suspect identified.

21:03.312 --> 21:05.302
White male, six foot tall,
heading north on Allen Street.

21:05.327 --> 21:07.116
Chicago police, stop!

21:07.562 --> 21:09.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:22.074 --> 21:24.174
Damn it, I said stop.

21:28.550 --> 21:29.649
What the hell?

21:30.220 --> 21:33.092
Squad, suspect just got
picked up by a second driver

21:33.117 --> 21:34.808
in a silver SUV. Headed north.

21:34.833 --> 21:35.855
that car come from?

21:35.880 --> 21:37.917
I don't know, Squad, out of nowhere.

21:37.943 --> 21:39.369
If I didn't know better,

21:39.394 --> 21:41.027
I'd say they got somebody on a computer

21:41.062 --> 21:42.945
looking out for them, too.

21:49.738 --> 21:53.058
Okay, so we have the dining room,

21:53.342 --> 21:55.885
living room, den,

21:55.985 --> 21:58.118
hallway leading to the back door.

21:58.154 --> 21:59.770
You have cameras in all those rooms?

21:59.795 --> 22:02.455
The smart home system
uses facial recognition

22:02.480 --> 22:04.358
to customize lighting and heating,

22:04.393 --> 22:06.350
and a whole bunch of other stuff
for each person in the house.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.859
Gideon, you live alone.

22:07.884 --> 22:10.189
I don't like to adjust
thermostats, all right?

22:10.214 --> 22:12.748
Right now, that's turning
out to be a very good thing.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.215
Just got to get her to the back door.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.656
And then, once she's in the yard,

22:19.681 --> 22:21.943
we should be able to transmit.

22:24.547 --> 22:26.346
Gideon, the guard.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.600
He's coming up the hallway.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.865
All right, she can only go so fast.

22:37.278 --> 22:38.563
Havana.

22:38.588 --> 22:39.770
What? What about it?

22:39.795 --> 22:41.332
We need a distraction.

22:49.692 --> 22:51.003
Okay, he's down the hallway.

22:51.028 --> 22:53.371
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Yes, yes, okay, okay.

23:19.394 --> 23:21.411
Looking for a signal.

23:21.436 --> 23:23.062
Looking for a signal... got it!

23:23.087 --> 23:24.433
Tell them that we need all units.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.486
Okay, it's not that simple. I
have to connect to Pete's computer

23:26.511 --> 23:27.521
with a service request.

23:27.546 --> 23:29.968
And then, once we get a connection,
then I can send a message.

23:35.097 --> 23:36.702
_

23:41.759 --> 23:43.386
Gideon, he's coming back.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.526
- Come on!
- Almost there, almost there.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.763
_

23:49.671 --> 23:52.469
- Send the message.
- Trying, trying.

23:56.595 --> 23:57.988
Oh, no.

24:00.396 --> 24:02.178
Oh, no, no, no.

24:04.341 --> 24:05.707
Oh, Gertrude.

24:06.553 --> 24:07.938
Did it transmit?

24:10.322 --> 24:12.569
I don't know, Murphy, I don't know.

24:22.283 --> 24:23.782
Gideon, did anything get through?

24:23.817 --> 24:25.650
We need to know if we
reached the station.

24:25.685 --> 24:28.253
We got a connection, but
the transmitter got smashed

24:28.288 --> 24:29.554
before the message went out.

24:29.589 --> 24:31.589
Gideon, this is our only hope here.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.646
Please, can you try again?

24:33.671 --> 24:36.421
I did, I just... I can
get a signal to Gertrude,

24:36.446 --> 24:38.696
but she can't transmit a message.

24:48.211 --> 24:50.076
I think that, um,

24:50.810 --> 24:52.548
we should consider negotiating.

24:54.529 --> 24:56.859
Negotiate? Are you serious?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.352
There's three guys
with AR-15s out there,

24:59.377 --> 25:01.145
versus you with a pistol and...

25:01.170 --> 25:02.668
I guess, me with a hammer?

25:02.693 --> 25:04.075
I just... I don't love our odds.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.744
We still have to fight, Gideon.

25:05.769 --> 25:07.050
Do you really think that those guys

25:07.075 --> 25:08.374
are gonna let us go as witnesses?

25:08.399 --> 25:10.033
Unless, um...

25:10.869 --> 25:13.641
we offer them something
that they want, and then...

25:13.666 --> 25:16.467
What do you mean,
something that they want?

25:18.142 --> 25:20.082
I think I know why they're here.

25:22.235 --> 25:25.609
There's something that I
didn't tell you about the lab.

25:30.347 --> 25:31.921
What's our situation at this point?

25:31.946 --> 25:32.968
We keep getting reports,

25:32.993 --> 25:34.950
but the same thing is
happening all over the district:

25:34.975 --> 25:38.042
individuals in masks
driving around in cars,

25:38.075 --> 25:39.986
just creating a general panic,

25:40.011 --> 25:42.656
but whenever one of our units
gets close to one of the cars,

25:42.681 --> 25:43.813
it gets abandoned.

25:43.838 --> 25:46.953
Well, if there are cars, there
are plate numbers, registrations?

25:46.978 --> 25:49.078
Yeah, I already tried
that, they're all clean.

25:49.103 --> 25:50.870
- So we got nothing?
- Nope.

25:50.895 --> 25:52.589
What about the source of the video?

25:52.614 --> 25:53.746
The guy in the mask?

25:53.781 --> 25:55.114
Yeah, nothing yet.

25:55.149 --> 25:56.516
Still working on it.

25:56.551 --> 25:59.051
- Yeah, uh, keep me posted.
- Sure.

26:08.138 --> 26:10.169
- Hey, Ada?
- Yes.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.497
Any idea why I'd be getting

26:11.522 --> 26:13.977
a diagnostic request from the GR unit

26:14.002 --> 26:15.401
at Gideon's house right now?

26:15.436 --> 26:16.802
You mean his annoying little robot?

26:16.838 --> 26:18.138
No, it's the least of our worries.

26:18.163 --> 26:20.404
Yeah, but I was
reconfiguring the servers

26:20.429 --> 26:22.271
to help with the search and I got this.

26:22.296 --> 26:23.898
_

26:23.923 --> 26:25.044
Wait, when did you get that?

26:25.079 --> 26:26.512
Like, a minute ago. Why?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.721
Oh, my God.

26:33.011 --> 26:36.212
You have to understand that the
stuff that I work on down here,

26:36.237 --> 26:37.703
it's-it's highly experimental.

26:37.728 --> 26:39.128
What I need to understand right now

26:39.153 --> 26:40.886
is what men with AR-15s want in here.

26:40.911 --> 26:42.752
All right, yes, okay, right, I know.

26:42.864 --> 26:44.677
- It's...
- What, a computer?

26:44.702 --> 26:47.013
It's what's inside the
computer. It's, it's...

26:47.038 --> 26:48.370
it's a surveillance system.

26:48.395 --> 26:51.431
Um, it invades other systems,

26:51.472 --> 26:53.172
collects data,

26:53.207 --> 26:54.907
- compiles it...
- What, like a virus?

26:54.943 --> 26:56.367
Kind of.

26:56.511 --> 26:58.844
Except... it can pull information

26:58.880 --> 27:00.261
from other sources, too.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.931
Video cameras, banking, social media.

27:01.956 --> 27:03.277
So, you're, you're stealing data?

27:03.302 --> 27:05.362
To identify criminal patterns.

27:05.387 --> 27:07.348
It's basically the same
thing that the NSA does.

27:07.373 --> 27:09.852
Only, you know, better and faster.

27:09.877 --> 27:12.340
And completely illegal.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.303
This is what the guy in
the mask was talking about?

27:17.328 --> 27:19.470
Maybe. Probably. Yeah.

27:19.495 --> 27:21.035
I don't... how would I know?
It's supposed to be secret!

27:21.060 --> 27:23.152
Yeah, so I've heard.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.311
Show me.

27:25.336 --> 27:27.307
Okay, so with the Internet
down, it's not actually op...

27:27.332 --> 27:29.199
Show me what you have.

27:33.205 --> 27:34.662
They just made it
through the second lock;

27:34.687 --> 27:36.329
we don't really have time for this.

27:38.032 --> 27:40.514
But the whole idea is to
put in a criminal's name

27:40.539 --> 27:43.398
and then run a deep scan
to see what comes up.

27:49.821 --> 27:51.537
Are these District 13 cops?

27:51.562 --> 27:53.167
Yes. It's not how it looks.

27:53.192 --> 27:54.558
I didn't want to use regular citizens,

27:54.593 --> 27:56.026
so I just... I wrote the code

27:56.061 --> 27:57.494
using our cops, 'cause I thought that

27:57.530 --> 27:59.531
that would be safer...
all right, all right.

27:59.556 --> 28:01.980
Gideon, those are my personal photos.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.093
And that's my address.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.607
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

28:08.632 --> 28:10.165
You have to understand,

28:10.190 --> 28:12.626
this was a secret project

28:12.651 --> 28:15.737
for extreme cases, for emergencies.

28:17.704 --> 28:20.247
The guy in the mask might be crazy,

28:20.272 --> 28:21.785
but he's not wrong.

28:22.477 --> 28:24.188
The whole point of rights

28:24.233 --> 28:26.170
is to protect people when it's hard,

28:26.195 --> 28:27.568
not when it's easy!

28:27.925 --> 28:29.821
We're supposed to be the good guys.

28:31.597 --> 28:34.164
This? This is wrong!

28:34.373 --> 28:37.697
Yeah, Murphy, I'm, I'm, I'm
painfully aware of that now.

28:37.722 --> 28:39.558
There is no way that we're
letting these bastards

28:39.583 --> 28:41.571
get their hands on this.
Do you understand me?

28:41.596 --> 28:42.612
Yeah.

28:44.433 --> 28:47.165
My sidearm's not gonna last long
against three assault rifles.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.990
We need a weapon.

28:49.015 --> 28:50.410
This is not a weapons lab.

28:50.435 --> 28:52.602
The only thing that we have down here...

28:52.627 --> 28:53.895
Is what?

28:54.094 --> 28:55.887
What do we have down here?

28:55.912 --> 28:57.645
I mean, there's one thing.

29:00.545 --> 29:02.283
But, uh...

29:04.330 --> 29:06.033
you're not gonna like it.

29:09.971 --> 29:12.037
- Go.
- Yeah.

29:13.636 --> 29:14.969
What the hell is this thing?

29:15.004 --> 29:17.002
It's the backup power for the lab.

29:17.027 --> 29:19.394
It's a 50 kilowatt lithium ion battery.

29:19.419 --> 29:21.986
Okay, there are men with
AR-15s that are coming in.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.930
What good is a battery gonna do?

29:23.955 --> 29:26.384
I mean, I hesitate to call it "good,"

29:26.716 --> 29:29.183
but if we put enough charge
into it, it will explode

29:29.218 --> 29:31.519
in a shower of thousand-degree metal,

29:31.554 --> 29:33.888
which would torch everything
in here to cinders.

29:33.923 --> 29:35.187
Including us?

29:35.212 --> 29:37.002
Um, probably, yeah.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.560
I did say that you
weren't gonna like it.

29:42.044 --> 29:45.879
There are three levels of
casing on those locks, Murphy.

29:47.264 --> 29:49.270
They just reached the third.

29:54.182 --> 29:56.020
So, what exactly am I looking for?

29:56.045 --> 29:57.678
Just look for anything
that doesn't belong.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.046
When you see it, you'll know.

29:59.081 --> 30:00.347
God, Gideon!

30:00.383 --> 30:01.826
Answer the phone.

30:01.851 --> 30:03.537
Wait, when was the last time
you guys upgraded the servers?

30:03.562 --> 30:06.757
Well, I mean, these are
Gideon's personal servers.

30:06.782 --> 30:07.884
I just can't get a hold of him.

30:07.909 --> 30:09.333
Phone, text, radio, nothing.

30:09.369 --> 30:13.051
He usually has a Reeves
tech team do any upgrades.

30:13.076 --> 30:14.709
They were just here, in fact.

30:15.490 --> 30:16.527
When?

30:17.720 --> 30:19.808
Two days ago. Right at 1:00 p.m.

30:19.841 --> 30:22.387
I know, because they
interrupted my lunch.

30:29.979 --> 30:31.144
Danny.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.340
Hey.

30:35.899 --> 30:38.417
- I think I found something.
- Yeah, me, too.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.558
You mean to tell me six guys in masks

30:40.583 --> 30:42.000
walked into a building with backpacks

30:42.025 --> 30:44.092
full of modeling clay
wired to clock radios?

30:44.138 --> 30:46.204
That makes no sense.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.639
Hey, I need to talk to you.

30:47.674 --> 30:49.037
Yeah, uh, keep me posted.

30:49.062 --> 30:51.129
- Conrad!
- Excuse me? What the hell?

30:51.156 --> 30:52.514
I need to get a car to Gideon's now!

30:52.547 --> 30:55.099
Ada, I got APB calls
coming in district-wide,

30:55.135 --> 30:56.668
fake bombs planted in backpacks.

30:56.693 --> 30:58.026
I just can't deal with this right now.

30:58.051 --> 30:59.702
Okay, listen, what's
happening in the 13th...

30:59.778 --> 31:00.943
it's just a distraction.

31:00.979 --> 31:02.445
What they're really after is Gideon.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.787
- And you know this because...?
- Because...

31:06.418 --> 31:07.917
Listen, I have been trying to get Gideon

31:07.952 --> 31:09.318
on his phone all day, it's dead.

31:09.354 --> 31:10.787
I've been trying Murphy on her radio,

31:10.822 --> 31:11.954
still nothing.

31:11.990 --> 31:14.701
We have been run all over
the city chasing shadows

31:14.726 --> 31:16.302
at the exact same time
that we can't get in touch

31:16.327 --> 31:17.698
with Gideon and Murphy.

31:19.906 --> 31:21.352
Oh, my God.

31:21.377 --> 31:22.686
Who's in the area?

31:22.711 --> 31:24.595
Attention, all available units,

31:24.620 --> 31:27.655
we need someone at 516
Pandora Lane immediately.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.215
There's a situation at Gideon's.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.807
1306. Copy that, Squad,
we're five minutes out.

31:31.832 --> 31:33.632
Negative, Squad, we got this.

31:33.667 --> 31:34.766
It's not a race.

31:34.802 --> 31:37.269
The hell it isn't. 1305 responding.

31:37.304 --> 31:38.281
Punch it.

31:42.273 --> 31:44.579
How bomb-proof are these? Not very.

31:44.604 --> 31:47.231
But I don't need to do a
metallurgical analysis to tell you

31:47.256 --> 31:50.036
those steel tables are
a lot harder than we are.

31:51.330 --> 31:52.462
All right, all right, all right.

31:52.487 --> 31:54.809
So, once I disable the safety circuits,

31:54.834 --> 31:56.591
this thing will start to overcharge.

31:56.616 --> 31:59.404
And after it hits a certain
threshold, I can blow it,

31:59.429 --> 32:00.727
but if they get in before that,

32:00.762 --> 32:02.891
you're gonna have to
hold 'em off for a while.

32:02.916 --> 32:04.219
A while? How long is a while?

32:04.262 --> 32:05.910
I don't know, I don't
know. About, like, a minute?

32:05.935 --> 32:08.552
Two? I don't know, I...
I've never done this before.

32:16.223 --> 32:18.772
- They stopped drilling.
- Mm-hmm. Listen.

32:19.863 --> 32:21.140
They're tapping through the locks.

32:21.165 --> 32:22.650
Get ready. They're coming in.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.708
- Is this thing ready?
- Um...

32:28.658 --> 32:29.844
It is now.

32:31.311 --> 32:34.343
First there was the bomb scare,
then a bunch of bozos in cars.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.427
- What you think is going on?
- I don't know exactly,

32:36.452 --> 32:37.885
but I don't like it.

32:39.711 --> 32:41.077
Okay,

32:41.102 --> 32:43.120
you're gonna have to hold 'em...

32:43.378 --> 32:46.799
at the entrance till that
thing's primed to blow.

32:46.824 --> 32:48.206
Yes, I know.

32:48.231 --> 32:49.543
I got it.

32:50.214 --> 32:52.103
I know that...

32:52.477 --> 32:54.366
you're not happy with me.

32:54.391 --> 32:55.889
Why would you say that?

32:55.924 --> 32:57.325
'Cause we're gonna get blown to pieces

32:57.350 --> 32:59.259
because of your dumb-ass move?

33:01.948 --> 33:03.582
I don't like to lose.

33:04.292 --> 33:05.909
All right?

33:06.203 --> 33:07.793
I lost Sully.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.304
Just trying to make sure
that we don't ever lose again.

33:11.339 --> 33:13.564
Losing is a part of the job, Gideon.

33:13.589 --> 33:15.322
Sometimes we lose.

33:15.357 --> 33:18.774
But it's not a win if we trample
over people's rights to get it.

33:31.115 --> 33:32.793
Apology accepted.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.485
Turn up here.

33:35.510 --> 33:37.105
Kill the lights and sirens.

33:49.605 --> 33:50.887
That van look weird to you?

33:50.912 --> 33:52.979
Everything looks weird to me today.

34:02.014 --> 34:03.991
I don't see anybody.

34:06.422 --> 34:07.897
Gideon! Murphy!

34:12.998 --> 34:14.547
Listen, listen.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.052
They stopped.

34:17.077 --> 34:18.266
Why?

34:25.795 --> 34:27.360
What the hell?

34:27.386 --> 34:29.126
What? What is it?

34:30.911 --> 34:32.848
Oh, my God, Murphy.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.723
Brandt and Goss are here.

34:36.313 --> 34:39.382
Yeah, and they're walking
right into an ambush.

34:47.659 --> 34:49.228
Anybody home?

34:54.085 --> 34:56.130
Brandt and Goss are gonna get
mowed down if they come in.

34:56.156 --> 34:57.565
We have to do something.

34:57.590 --> 34:58.589
Send them a signal.

34:58.614 --> 35:00.114
How? They-they can't hear us.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.308
The lights.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.708
Can you control them from here?

35:02.733 --> 35:04.066
Yeah, yeah, I can do that.

35:04.925 --> 35:06.486
Anybody home?

35:09.615 --> 35:11.543
All right. Let's go around back.

35:22.274 --> 35:24.675
- It's not working.
- Oh, I can see that, I can see that.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.536
Hang on. I'm gonna try something else.

35:26.561 --> 35:29.163
Gideon, there is a
bomb heating up in here.

35:29.717 --> 35:30.916
What are you gonna do?

35:30.941 --> 35:32.893
I'm trying to send a signal to Gertrude.

35:32.918 --> 35:34.668
The robot? I thought
you said she was broken.

35:34.693 --> 35:36.579
She is. She can't transmit,

35:36.604 --> 35:38.303
but she can still receive.

35:38.327 --> 35:39.893
Might be able to get a message to them.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.332
I just, I just, I just,
I don't know what to say.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.411
What do you mean?

35:43.436 --> 35:45.404
That there's three men
with guns in the house.

35:45.429 --> 35:47.168
I have nine characters.

35:47.193 --> 35:49.026
Her screen is for error messages,

35:49.051 --> 35:51.436
not ambush warnings.

35:52.431 --> 35:55.665
3-A-M-B-A-R-D-E-N.

35:55.971 --> 35:57.006
- What?
- Just type it.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.448
What? Uh, 3...

36:01.042 --> 36:02.226
What the hell is that?

36:02.251 --> 36:03.484
I don't know.

36:03.509 --> 36:04.825
Be careful.

36:09.781 --> 36:11.595
There's something on the screen.

36:11.620 --> 36:12.723
What's it say?

36:12.748 --> 36:16.445
"3-A-M-B-A-R-D-E-N."

36:16.470 --> 36:18.937
I'm guessing it's some
kind of error message.

36:18.962 --> 36:20.244
That's not an error message.

36:20.269 --> 36:22.546
That's a standard,
military salute report.

36:23.831 --> 36:25.430
"Three", three targets.

36:25.455 --> 36:26.913
"A-M-B", ambush.

36:26.938 --> 36:28.604
"A-R", AR-15s.

36:28.629 --> 36:30.771
What the hell does "D-E-N" stand for?

36:30.796 --> 36:32.130
Well, it's a house.

36:32.155 --> 36:33.654
Got to have a den.

36:33.693 --> 36:34.825
Let's go.

36:36.776 --> 36:38.788
Do you think they understood that?

36:38.813 --> 36:40.820
When Brandt and I were rookies together,

36:40.845 --> 36:43.313
all he would talk about
was his time in the Rangers.

36:43.604 --> 36:46.139
Made me learn all their
codes while we were driving.

36:46.942 --> 36:48.568
He better understand it.

36:48.598 --> 36:50.848
Goss, the door's been forced.

37:11.292 --> 37:12.745
1305, Squad.

37:12.770 --> 37:14.723
Looks like we had
ourselves a burglary here.

37:14.748 --> 37:17.557
But, uh, seems all clear now.

37:18.219 --> 37:21.754
Yeah, these guys look
like they're long gone.

37:21.932 --> 37:23.352
We're headed home now.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.407
- On the ground!
- Get on the ground now!

37:28.007 --> 37:29.707
Don't move! Stay on the ground!

37:29.732 --> 37:32.052
Where's the third? Where's the third?

37:38.606 --> 37:40.099
They need our help.

37:40.124 --> 37:41.726
Well, they're about to get it.

37:41.751 --> 37:43.117
Murphy, get down.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.891
Goss. Goss! You all right?

37:52.916 --> 37:55.584
Oh, yeah. What was that?

37:58.863 --> 37:59.965
Freeze!

38:13.233 --> 38:15.472
You guys sure know how
to make an entrance.

38:16.219 --> 38:17.788
Yeah, you, too.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.456
Well...

38:32.322 --> 38:34.779
might be time to look for a new place.

38:44.344 --> 38:46.145
That's good, let's go.

38:46.380 --> 38:48.046
You finally got your boom.

38:48.081 --> 38:49.483
Now are you happy?

38:49.783 --> 38:52.438
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

38:53.155 --> 38:56.983
I am going to request
special commendations

38:57.008 --> 38:58.875
for the both of us.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.466
Bravery in the line of duty.

39:01.735 --> 39:03.265
You're gonna give yourself a medal?

39:03.290 --> 39:06.404
Yeah. I don't know,
maybe just a little one.

39:10.003 --> 39:12.304
And Gertrude here gets a Purple Heart.

39:12.339 --> 39:13.726
Don't you, girl?

39:17.411 --> 39:18.776
Good girl.

39:19.865 --> 39:21.265
Hey, um...

39:21.290 --> 39:24.366
I meant what I said down there.

39:25.615 --> 39:27.306
I nearly got us killed.

39:29.022 --> 39:31.170
That's just a chain reaction.

39:31.195 --> 39:32.906
There's gonna be more of those.

39:32.931 --> 39:34.969
What? We rigged it to
explode. It's exploding.

39:34.994 --> 39:36.887
But your house? The lab?

39:36.912 --> 39:39.380
Well, probably for the best.

39:39.405 --> 39:40.992
As you so eloquently put it,

39:41.017 --> 39:44.231
I had no business having a
secret lab in the first place.

39:47.798 --> 39:49.408
And now I don't.

39:52.885 --> 39:56.596
Well, easily a million
dollars in damage,

39:56.621 --> 39:59.405
and I'm pretty sure that secret labs

39:59.430 --> 40:02.187
are not covered by
insurance, which is why,

40:02.222 --> 40:04.389
as Murphy could tell you firsthand,

40:04.424 --> 40:06.397
I do not like throwing
parties at my house.

40:06.422 --> 40:08.158
So, please, tell me you have something

40:08.183 --> 40:09.216
we can move on, Captain.

40:09.241 --> 40:11.564
I would love to know where
to send that cleaning bill.

40:11.589 --> 40:13.968
Well, the terror attacks
themselves amount to nothing,

40:13.993 --> 40:16.468
just smoke and mirrors to divert us

40:16.503 --> 40:18.537
from the real attack at your house.

40:18.572 --> 40:19.871
The gunmen are in holding.

40:19.907 --> 40:21.072
I want to talk to them.

40:21.108 --> 40:22.633
You'll get your chance.

40:22.658 --> 40:25.807
What we need to know
is who's behind this.

40:25.832 --> 40:27.479
Who has the reach and financing

40:27.514 --> 40:28.914
to launch an attack on this level?

40:28.949 --> 40:30.282
Well, here's the plan, Captain.

40:30.317 --> 40:34.019
I want every resource put
into finding who this is,

40:34.054 --> 40:35.854
every drone, microchip,

40:35.889 --> 40:38.880
every warm body we can
squeeze into a uniform.

40:38.905 --> 40:40.620
That won't be necessary.

40:41.977 --> 40:43.809
He terrorized the entire district, Ada.

40:43.834 --> 40:45.067
He nearly killed me and Murphy.

40:45.092 --> 40:46.308
Yeah, it won't be necessary

40:46.333 --> 40:49.818
because I already know who it is.

40:52.039 --> 40:54.718
It-it's a hacker named Danny Reghabi.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.541
He goes by the handle DV8

40:56.577 --> 40:59.477
and he's connected to a black-hat group

40:59.513 --> 41:03.127
that deals with organized
crime and money laundering

41:03.152 --> 41:04.420
and information selling.

41:04.445 --> 41:06.051
Uh, you got all of that

41:06.086 --> 41:07.519
- from tracing a video?
- No.

41:07.554 --> 41:09.321
I know him personally.

41:09.619 --> 41:10.720
What?

41:10.759 --> 41:12.879
Yeah, Danny and I used to be friends

41:12.904 --> 41:13.959
a really long time ago,

41:13.994 --> 41:16.328
and then he got into black-hat hacking

41:16.363 --> 41:17.708
and we went our separate ways,

41:17.733 --> 41:19.712
but since I've been at the 13th,

41:19.737 --> 41:22.176
he's done some favors for me.

41:22.201 --> 41:24.349
- Favor?
- Yeah, he helped me

41:24.374 --> 41:27.509
with a domestic abuse
case a few months ago.

41:27.941 --> 41:31.345
And the guy who blew himself up

41:31.478 --> 41:33.951
while he was trying to
rob that armored truck

41:33.976 --> 41:35.542
on Grand Street...

41:35.567 --> 41:36.885
Oh, my God.

41:36.910 --> 41:38.710
That wasn't an accident.

41:38.823 --> 41:40.118
Danny found out

41:40.153 --> 41:42.120
what was going on here at the 13th

41:42.155 --> 41:45.485
and he demanded that I
help him shut it down.

41:45.510 --> 41:46.643
Ada.

41:49.005 --> 41:50.251
How could you not tell me this?

41:50.276 --> 41:52.143
Because I thought that I'd handled it.

41:52.168 --> 41:55.869
I got guys that he worked
with to call him off.

41:56.638 --> 42:00.166
But I checked on those
guys earlier, and...

42:01.457 --> 42:02.857
they're dead.

42:08.063 --> 42:11.059
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

42:11.084 --> 42:14.853
And I... I'll quit, I'll resign.

42:14.888 --> 42:15.954
Resign?

42:15.989 --> 42:17.389
Resign?!

42:17.424 --> 42:18.623
Is that a joke?

42:18.659 --> 42:19.958
We're way past that.

42:19.993 --> 42:21.320
- Murphy.
- You're looking at jail time.

42:21.345 --> 42:23.028
Hold on, hold on. Murphy.

42:23.063 --> 42:24.463
Something's happening.

42:31.611 --> 42:33.159
What the hell?

42:39.580 --> 42:41.263
This is live.

42:41.304 --> 42:43.230
He's hacked past our firewalls.

42:47.652 --> 42:49.584
Hello again, Gideon.

42:50.820 --> 42:54.025
Hope today was as fun
for you as it was for me.

42:54.061 --> 42:56.019
How did you like watching your district

42:56.044 --> 42:58.469
chase its bushy little tail?

42:58.632 --> 43:00.231
Too bad about your lab.

43:00.267 --> 43:01.402
Bummer.

43:01.427 --> 43:05.096
The world doesn't get to learn
about your nasty, little secret.

43:05.121 --> 43:06.915
But no worries.

43:06.940 --> 43:09.240
We are going to start
waking up this city

43:09.276 --> 43:10.969
to your little fascist nightmare,

43:10.994 --> 43:13.150
even if it kills them.

43:18.495 --> 43:19.890
Mask off.

43:20.628 --> 43:22.020
Gloves off.

43:22.055 --> 43:23.405
Game on.

43:25.002 --> 43:26.409
Come and get me.

43:28.178 --> 43:29.629
Okay, everybody.

43:30.648 --> 43:31.801
New plan.
