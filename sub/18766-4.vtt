WEBVTT

00:00.137 --> 00:01.842
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:01.843 --> 00:03.106
You wanted to be informed

00:03.107 --> 00:05.041
when he arrived.

00:06.610 --> 00:09.178
Any idea yet why he's come down to D.C.?

00:09.179 --> 00:10.613
If the Horseman has set his sights

00:10.614 --> 00:12.181
on the president of the United States,

00:12.182 --> 00:14.517
nothing will deter him from his goal.

00:14.518 --> 00:16.486
My whole life I believed
there was something

00:16.487 --> 00:17.910
bigger out there and now I find out

00:17.911 --> 00:19.055
it's all true.

00:19.056 --> 00:20.156
Remind me to punch you

00:20.157 --> 00:21.391
even harder than I usually do.

00:21.392 --> 00:23.493
You kept crucial information from me

00:23.494 --> 00:24.997
about who you are, where you're from,

00:24.998 --> 00:26.996
when you're from

00:26.997 --> 00:28.731
and about my daughter.

00:28.732 --> 00:29.932
Molly's safety

00:29.933 --> 00:31.100
is absolute paramount.

00:31.101 --> 00:32.502
Which is why none of you

00:32.503 --> 00:34.170
are coming anywhere near her.

00:51.555 --> 00:53.122
Oh...

00:53.123 --> 00:54.357
hey.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.391
Hey.

00:55.392 --> 00:57.660
Um, is your mom home?

00:58.629 --> 01:00.196
Uh, yeah, but she told me

01:00.197 --> 01:01.497
I wasn't supposed to talk

01:01.498 --> 01:03.499
to you... or your friends.

01:05.636 --> 01:07.437
Molly, inside, now.

01:11.141 --> 01:12.475
What are you doing here?

01:12.476 --> 01:13.943
We came to talk.

01:15.212 --> 01:17.213
Is Crane here? He said he'd meet me.

01:17.214 --> 01:18.247
No, he's not here.

01:18.248 --> 01:19.951
I told the two of you
to stay away from us.

01:19.952 --> 01:20.850
Look, I know this is

01:20.851 --> 01:22.318
a lot for you to handle,

01:22.319 --> 01:24.153
finding out that Molly
is the next Witness.

01:24.154 --> 01:27.223
I have lived through what that's like,

01:27.224 --> 01:28.691
that's why you have to listen to us.

01:28.692 --> 01:29.959
The only thing I have to do

01:29.960 --> 01:31.127
is protect my daughter.

01:31.128 --> 01:32.362
I know, of course,

01:32.363 --> 01:34.230
and all I'm trying to say

01:34.231 --> 01:35.798
is...

01:37.501 --> 01:38.801
Damn it, where is Crane?

01:38.802 --> 01:40.185
He said we would do this together.

01:40.186 --> 01:41.371
Well, when you find him,

01:41.372 --> 01:43.940
you can both not come here again.

01:46.844 --> 01:49.412
That went well.

01:52.549 --> 01:54.050
Mr. Dreyfuss,

01:54.051 --> 01:55.554
how was your visit with Dr. Lonergan?

01:55.555 --> 01:57.387
Dr. Lonergan said

01:57.388 --> 02:01.057
my current life expectancy is 85 years.

02:01.058 --> 02:02.925
Eighty-five?

02:02.926 --> 02:04.560
Enough for most.

02:04.561 --> 02:06.295
When I'm 85,

02:06.296 --> 02:08.364
I'm just gonna be getting started.

02:08.365 --> 02:10.265
Think about what I've
accomplished so far

02:10.267 --> 02:12.802
and then think about
how much more I could do.

02:12.803 --> 02:14.637
It's not that I need to have more time,

02:14.638 --> 02:17.206
it's that the world needs
me to have more time.

02:17.207 --> 02:18.741
This is for their benefit.

02:18.742 --> 02:20.543
Of course...

02:20.544 --> 02:21.844
and it has nothing to do

02:21.845 --> 02:23.508
with what will happen
to your eternal soul

02:23.509 --> 02:24.313
upon your death.

02:25.682 --> 02:27.016
My friend...

02:27.985 --> 02:29.018
...I'm afraid you

02:29.019 --> 02:30.386
think too small.

02:30.387 --> 02:32.021
Once again, thank you.

02:32.022 --> 02:35.191
I encourage you to
think globally, but act

02:35.192 --> 02:36.626
narrowly.

02:36.627 --> 02:38.528
Case in point, where are we

02:38.529 --> 02:39.762
with the next talisman? Hmm?

02:39.763 --> 02:41.697
Still tracking it, but in the meantime,

02:41.698 --> 02:43.241
I've located the map of the ley lines,

02:43.242 --> 02:45.234
the wellsprings where
their power converges.

02:45.235 --> 02:47.303
It's arriving at a museum tonight.

02:47.304 --> 02:48.438
Wunderbar.

02:48.439 --> 02:49.906
At last,

02:49.907 --> 02:51.574
finally get to know
where we can assemble

02:51.575 --> 02:54.310
all these lovely puzzle pieces.

02:56.613 --> 02:58.481
Crane?

02:59.750 --> 03:01.083
Hello?

03:02.052 --> 03:04.153
Crane?

03:04.154 --> 03:06.756
You left me hanging with Diana.

03:06.757 --> 03:09.325
How many times have I told
you to get a decent dead bolt?

03:09.326 --> 03:10.789
A five-year-old could break in here.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.924
Crane?

03:14.364 --> 03:16.465
Oh.

03:17.534 --> 03:20.036
Ugh.

03:20.037 --> 03:22.071
Crane?

03:35.486 --> 03:37.587
Oh.

03:48.799 --> 03:50.433
According to the spectrometer,

03:50.434 --> 03:52.034
it's ten percent unknown protein

03:52.035 --> 03:54.704
and 90% ferric hydroxide.

03:54.705 --> 03:56.205
That's spider silk.

03:56.206 --> 03:58.007
Spider silk?

03:58.008 --> 03:59.842
That was all over Crane's apartment.

03:59.843 --> 04:01.177
Well, that's a big-ass spider.

04:01.178 --> 04:02.545
- It can't be good.
- Okay, well,

04:02.546 --> 04:04.780
Diana can probably put
out an APB on Crane.

04:04.781 --> 04:07.981
You know, maybe he just went to
the mall and got lost... again.

04:07.982 --> 04:10.553
No, he's not answering
any of his calls or texts.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.299
Okay, well, maybe she
can put out a trace...

04:12.300 --> 04:13.523
No, we don't need to call her.

04:13.524 --> 04:15.224
Besides,

04:15.225 --> 04:18.094
wherever Crane is now,
a cop is not gonna help.

04:18.095 --> 04:20.428
The last time I saw him he
was coming out of J Street.

04:20.430 --> 04:24.133
Dreyfuss said they used to
trap monsters there and...

04:24.134 --> 04:27.036
it's possible we brought
something else back with us.

04:27.037 --> 04:28.304
Something evil.

04:28.305 --> 04:29.839
- Or something that took Crane?
- Yes.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.941
Something that doesn't like light.

04:31.942 --> 04:37.179
Whatever made this probably
goes real heavy on the SPF.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.848
Wait, hang on.

04:38.849 --> 04:41.183
Oh, yes, yes, uh, I read something

04:41.184 --> 04:43.753
in Benjamin Franklin's journals.

04:43.754 --> 04:45.321
Uh... here.

04:45.322 --> 04:47.023
In 1778,

04:47.024 --> 04:49.025
Franklin wrote about coming across

04:49.026 --> 04:50.860
"a curious substance.

04:50.861 --> 04:52.929
"A, uh, viscous secretion

04:52.930 --> 04:54.353
"displaying otherworldly properties

04:54.354 --> 04:56.165
and marked photophobia."

04:56.166 --> 04:57.709
Where did Franklin find the substance?

04:57.710 --> 04:59.802
Uh, he found it from some
colonists in Maryland.

04:59.803 --> 05:02.572
Apparently a farmer from
Williamsburg went missing.

05:02.573 --> 05:04.974
Uh, they discovered his
body a week later in a cave

05:04.975 --> 05:06.676
in the Aberdeen Woods.

05:06.677 --> 05:08.457
I mean, it had been
cocooned in this stuff.

05:11.048 --> 05:12.315
"Cava Desperavi."

05:12.316 --> 05:15.251
The cave of despair.

05:15.252 --> 05:18.387
Oh, yeah, that doesn't
sound ominous at all.

05:18.388 --> 05:19.891
39 degrees by...

05:19.892 --> 05:22.491
seventy-six.

05:22.492 --> 05:24.527
It's the Aberdeen Proving Ground.

05:24.528 --> 05:26.629
Wait, you think the
cave is still out there?

05:26.630 --> 05:28.297
Only one way to find out.

05:28.298 --> 05:29.832
Um, Aberdeen is an army facility

05:29.833 --> 05:31.701
with army men carrying army guns.

05:31.702 --> 05:33.669
And it's standing
between me and that cave.

05:33.670 --> 05:35.071
Noted.

05:35.072 --> 05:36.906
- Okay, then we'll go with you.
- We will?

05:36.907 --> 05:39.090
Yes, if you're going out
there, we got your back.

05:39.091 --> 05:40.576
Thank you.

05:40.577 --> 05:42.345
But this is a little out of your league.

05:42.346 --> 05:44.613
It's easier if I go alone.

05:46.049 --> 05:47.752
She thinks we can't handle it.

05:47.753 --> 05:49.952
You think that we can handle five to ten

05:49.953 --> 05:52.722
- for trespassing on a military base?
- Okay, Alex,

05:52.723 --> 05:55.291
we helped take down a
Horseman of the Apocalypse.

05:55.292 --> 05:56.726
Okay, our days of just sitting here

05:56.727 --> 05:57.910
and watching this world go by

05:57.911 --> 05:59.729
are over. Done.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.263
Jenny doesn't need us.

06:01.264 --> 06:03.232
Really? Alex,

06:03.233 --> 06:05.134
the Catholics who founded Maryland

06:05.135 --> 06:06.902
thought that this cave was home

06:06.903 --> 06:09.639
to the Sicarius Spei.
The slayer of hope.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.974
All right, this thing is the living

06:11.975 --> 06:15.478
embodiment of despair, and it
doesn't just kill its victims.

06:15.479 --> 06:16.746
No, it...

06:16.747 --> 06:18.781
it-it feeds on their misery

06:18.782 --> 06:21.217
until it drives them to kill themselves.

06:21.218 --> 06:22.985
You think she's ready for that?

06:43.473 --> 06:47.143
Hang the bastard, hang him.

06:48.578 --> 06:51.480
- Murderer!
- String him up!

06:51.481 --> 06:53.682
Where am I?

07:00.524 --> 07:03.025
What in God's name is this?

07:03.026 --> 07:04.427
Order!

07:04.428 --> 07:07.630
Captain Ichabod Crane.

07:07.631 --> 07:10.299
The jurors of our sovereign lord

07:10.300 --> 07:13.135
present that you did commit
certain crimes of cowardice,

07:13.136 --> 07:14.770
thoughtlessness,

07:14.771 --> 07:18.174
and abdication of your
sacred duties as a Witness.

07:18.175 --> 07:19.508
You stand charged

07:19.509 --> 07:21.944
with the sundry act of murder.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.815
Murder?

07:25.816 --> 07:27.249
Whose murder?

07:27.250 --> 07:29.351
Who is making this accusation?

07:39.496 --> 07:41.997
No.

07:41.998 --> 07:43.532
It can't be.

07:43.533 --> 07:46.402
Hello, Father.

08:13.136 --> 08:19.836
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

08:26.509 --> 08:29.310
This is not real.

08:29.311 --> 08:31.505
This is some kind of nightmare or...

08:31.506 --> 08:33.231
a vision, or...

08:33.232 --> 08:35.691
Is this a dead girl
which I see before me?

08:35.692 --> 08:38.961
But I was in my rooms, and then, um...

08:38.962 --> 08:40.261
I assure you

08:40.263 --> 08:42.530
I am as real

08:42.532 --> 08:45.267
as the guilt in your heaving heart.

08:45.268 --> 08:47.169
- No, you are not my son.
- Mm, oh.

08:47.170 --> 08:48.537
Henry died.

08:48.538 --> 08:50.973
You have seen enough spirits come back

08:50.974 --> 08:53.709
from beyond the veil, Father.

08:53.710 --> 08:56.445
Look at me.

08:56.446 --> 08:57.680
Am I not

08:57.681 --> 08:59.782
the baby you abandoned?

09:01.952 --> 09:03.319
Am I not the child

09:03.320 --> 09:05.054
you left to be persecuted?

09:10.427 --> 09:13.162
Am I not the man you snuffed out

09:13.163 --> 09:15.130
like a simpering dog?

09:19.536 --> 09:22.538
If this truly is you,

09:22.539 --> 09:25.174
Henry,

09:25.175 --> 09:26.809
then I too am dead,

09:26.810 --> 09:30.045
and this is a kind of limbo

09:30.046 --> 09:33.148
where I await eternal judgment.

09:34.284 --> 09:36.652
If that makes you feel better.

09:38.121 --> 09:40.389
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:40.390 --> 09:43.526
I have an opening statement to make...

09:43.527 --> 09:47.163
to prove Ichabod Crane
is guilty of the murder

09:47.164 --> 09:50.366
of Abigail Mills.

10:17.894 --> 10:19.117
Freeze!

10:19.118 --> 10:21.263
Ah.

10:21.264 --> 10:23.098
Pete, is that you? Quit fooling around.

10:23.099 --> 10:25.122
This is a restricted area.
What are you doing here?

10:25.123 --> 10:27.336
Oh, wait, you're not Pete.

10:27.337 --> 10:28.237
Put the bag down.

10:28.238 --> 10:29.505
- What?
- Bag down.

10:29.506 --> 10:30.739
Oh, okay, uh...

10:30.740 --> 10:32.107
- Hands up.
- Okay.

10:32.108 --> 10:33.776
Uh, I thought you were my boyfriend.

10:33.777 --> 10:35.911
I-I'm sorry, we were just
trying to find our way

10:35.912 --> 10:38.113
off the trails and he went up ahead.

10:38.114 --> 10:40.215
Is he okay? Where is he?

10:41.551 --> 10:43.285
This is an army facility.

10:43.286 --> 10:45.109
- What?
- Didn't you see the signs walking in?

10:45.110 --> 10:47.957
No, no, I didn't see
anything. I'm so sorry.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.358
Am I in trouble?

10:52.229 --> 10:54.430
Come on, I'll get you out of here.

10:54.431 --> 10:55.965
- I can get that.
- I got it.

10:55.966 --> 10:57.266
Whoa, whoa,

10:57.267 --> 10:59.268
hey, what is that?

10:59.269 --> 11:01.237
- Hands back up! Hands up!
- Yeah.

11:01.238 --> 11:02.972
Cover her.

11:02.973 --> 11:04.673
Hands behind your back.

11:07.177 --> 11:09.945
That is so not good.

11:09.946 --> 11:11.413
We got to help her.

11:11.414 --> 11:13.182
How?

11:13.183 --> 11:16.118
See if they'll trade her
for some free archiving work?

11:16.119 --> 11:18.754
I have an idea.

11:18.755 --> 11:19.855
Ladies...

11:21.324 --> 11:23.092
...gentlemen,

11:23.093 --> 11:24.960
friends,

11:24.961 --> 11:29.431
we are not here for mere vengeance,

11:29.432 --> 11:31.967
petty victories.

11:31.968 --> 11:33.235
We are here

11:33.236 --> 11:35.838
for justice

11:35.839 --> 11:37.239
for one who greatly deserves it:

11:39.242 --> 11:41.910
Grace Abigail Mills.

11:41.911 --> 11:43.746
She was a warrior,

11:43.747 --> 11:44.913
a champion,

11:44.914 --> 11:46.749
and her life was cut short

11:46.750 --> 11:48.684
by the senseless actions

11:48.685 --> 11:50.352
of this man before you.

11:50.353 --> 11:52.955
Murderer!

11:52.956 --> 11:54.323
This is insanity.

11:54.324 --> 11:55.824
The Lieutenant died so that

11:55.825 --> 11:57.326
all of us may live.

11:57.327 --> 11:59.128
She sacrificed herself for you.

11:59.129 --> 12:00.663
Because there was no other way

12:00.664 --> 12:02.231
to stop the apocalypse.

12:02.232 --> 12:04.466
No other way? Ha!

12:04.467 --> 12:07.536
That's your excuse for
everything, isn't it?

12:07.537 --> 12:09.371
There was no other way

12:09.372 --> 12:13.309
to save the life of Joe Corbin, either.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.577
Or Abraham Van Brunt

12:15.578 --> 12:17.913
or my mother.

12:17.914 --> 12:19.148
Murderer!

12:19.149 --> 12:20.749
Murderer!

12:20.750 --> 12:23.452
Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow

12:23.453 --> 12:25.287
this man...

12:25.288 --> 12:27.656
to bear another child,

12:27.657 --> 12:29.358
to love another wife,

12:29.359 --> 12:31.160
to make another friend.

12:31.161 --> 12:32.728
We cannot allow

12:32.729 --> 12:36.198
Ichabod Crane to live another day.

12:38.234 --> 12:40.169
'Cause everyone he touches,

12:40.170 --> 12:42.638
sooner or later, dies.

13:01.191 --> 13:02.891
Is it dinner time yet?

13:02.892 --> 13:04.460
I'm starving.

13:04.461 --> 13:07.363
- All I have are Tic Tacs.
- What are you doing here?

13:07.364 --> 13:08.797
I'm saving your ass.

13:08.798 --> 13:10.099
You're welcome, by the way.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.567
You've been released

13:11.568 --> 13:13.435
on the recognizance
of Homeland Security.

13:13.436 --> 13:15.371
Anything you do now

13:15.372 --> 13:16.872
reflects on me.

13:16.873 --> 13:18.296
Need you to sign right here, ma'am.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.965
Thank you.

13:21.608 --> 13:22.911
And how did you know I was here?

13:22.912 --> 13:24.380
Jake and Alex called,

13:24.381 --> 13:25.814
said you were in trouble.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.280
You know, it's nothing
I couldn't have handled.

13:29.281 --> 13:31.548
Next pee break, I was gone.

13:33.022 --> 13:35.023
So, why don't you save
the "you're welcomes"

13:35.024 --> 13:36.458
for someone who needs 'em.

13:40.190 --> 13:41.613
I've entered the coordinates

13:41.614 --> 13:43.799
of this cave of yours into my GPS.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.735
I thought you didn't want to
have anything to do with us.

13:46.736 --> 13:48.637
Well, I don't want you
anywhere near Molly.

13:48.638 --> 13:52.107
I don't trust you,
not after all the lies.

13:52.108 --> 13:54.109
But Jake called and
said it was an emergency,

13:54.110 --> 13:56.111
that Crane could be hurt or worse.

13:56.112 --> 13:58.247
And you just had to come help?

13:58.248 --> 13:59.711
You know, it may come as a surprise,

13:59.712 --> 14:01.135
but Crane and I got along just fine

14:01.136 --> 14:02.551
for a long time without you.

14:02.552 --> 14:04.953
I know all about how you got along.

14:04.954 --> 14:07.790
Single mom, deadbeat dad,

14:07.791 --> 14:10.492
in and out of foster care
before bouncing between juvy

14:10.493 --> 14:12.728
and psych institutions.

14:14.431 --> 14:16.698
Your file made for an interesting read.

14:20.770 --> 14:22.571
So my file,

14:22.572 --> 14:25.407
did it say anything about why
I was in the psych institutions?

14:26.976 --> 14:30.546
Abby and I ran into something
when we were Molly's age.

14:30.547 --> 14:33.882
Something supernatural and it
messed us up for a long time.

14:33.883 --> 14:35.417
Only later did we find out

14:35.418 --> 14:38.153
that it all happened
because Abby was the Witness.

14:40.323 --> 14:41.690
Hey,

14:41.691 --> 14:43.425
you can try and deny what's happening.

14:43.426 --> 14:45.627
That's what my sister did.

14:45.628 --> 14:47.763
But it caught up to
her and sooner or later,

14:47.764 --> 14:49.097
it's gonna catch up to you.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.399
And Molly, too.

14:53.770 --> 14:55.470
Something was dragged down here.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.075
Spider silk.

15:35.211 --> 15:37.145
I hate spiders.

15:44.521 --> 15:45.621
Crane!

15:46.689 --> 15:49.658
Oh, God. What is this?

15:49.659 --> 15:50.826
It's a cocoon.

15:50.827 --> 15:53.328
- A cocoon?
- Yeah.

15:54.264 --> 15:56.298
Ah, it's stuck.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.634
Damn it!

16:12.515 --> 16:13.515
Diana, stop!

16:14.284 --> 16:16.351
You're hurting Crane.

16:21.057 --> 16:22.791
What's happening to me?

16:26.167 --> 16:28.528
- What?
- Crane is bleeding from the same place

16:28.529 --> 16:30.330
as that thing.

16:30.331 --> 16:32.432
They must be psychically linked.

16:32.433 --> 16:34.601
I don't think we can
kill it or it'll kill him.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.637
Cut him down and let's get out of here.

16:36.638 --> 16:37.781
I'm trying! It's too strong.

16:37.782 --> 16:40.340
Plus, I don't think it's normal webbing.

16:40.341 --> 16:42.175
I think it's nerves of some kind.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.614
Whatever that thing is,
it's gonna come back soon.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.349
- We cannot stay here.
- Wait,

16:49.350 --> 16:50.217
we got to...

16:50.218 --> 16:51.652
Come on!

16:51.653 --> 16:54.121
We'll be back, I promise.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.634
I have seen your true face, demon.

17:09.369 --> 17:10.904
This is an illusion.

17:14.776 --> 17:17.109
You need me alive.

17:19.446 --> 17:21.481
You need me to succumb willingly.

17:23.351 --> 17:25.685
Very well.

17:25.686 --> 17:28.221
Shall we play this game?

17:29.724 --> 17:31.858
You are good, wise,

17:31.859 --> 17:33.760
God-fearing people.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.328
Will you hear me speak

17:35.329 --> 17:37.272
or will you simply accept
what this man tells you

17:37.273 --> 17:39.199
with his... frankly, cheap rhetoric

17:39.200 --> 17:40.934
and grandstanding?

17:40.935 --> 17:43.403
I ask you before God,

17:43.404 --> 17:45.872
allow me to defend myself.

17:50.344 --> 17:51.778
Let's hear what he has to say!

17:51.779 --> 17:53.246
Let's hear him!

17:53.247 --> 17:54.590
Let's hear it!

17:54.591 --> 17:55.282
Order,

17:55.283 --> 17:56.383
order,

17:56.384 --> 17:57.617
order...

17:57.618 --> 17:59.219
order in the court!

17:59.220 --> 18:00.011
Your Honor,

18:00.012 --> 18:02.046
may we allow the accused to speak?

18:04.683 --> 18:06.784
He can only make things
worse for himself.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.890
Hey, guys, uh, I think

18:12.891 --> 18:14.392
I found something.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.727
Franklin's journals didn't
have any more reference

18:16.728 --> 18:18.596
to the Despair creature, but

18:18.597 --> 18:21.599
he did reference the
account of a freed slave who

18:21.600 --> 18:23.301
had a run-in with it at Valley Forge.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.902
Now, I located the account,

18:24.903 --> 18:27.138
but it's in some kind
of handwritten code.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.639
That's Grace Dixon.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.008
Yeah, that's right. How'd you know?

18:31.009 --> 18:32.977
She was a key figure in
the battle against evil

18:32.978 --> 18:34.946
during the war and a friend of Crane's.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.248
Abby and I are her direct descendants.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.850
Try an Al-Qalqashand
transposition cipher,

18:39.851 --> 18:41.118
keyword: Fredericks.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.286
That was badass.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.322
I can scan this and make a digital copy.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.323
Oh, cool, sure.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.757
- Here.
- Okay.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.159
Okay, just let me

18:48.160 --> 18:50.328
try and get this straight... so,

18:50.329 --> 18:53.497
Crane worked with Grace
Dixon 250 years ago.

18:53.498 --> 18:54.932
Then he wakes up in our time

18:54.933 --> 18:56.834
and the first person
he met was your sister,

18:56.835 --> 18:59.937
her great-great-great granddaughter?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.174
That's quite a coincidence.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.910
No, there are no coincidences. This...

19:05.911 --> 19:07.979
this is what we've
been trying to tell you.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.414
All of us, everyone in this fight,

19:10.415 --> 19:11.682
our lives are entwined.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.884
From Grace, toe and Abby,

19:13.885 --> 19:16.587
to Abby and Crane, it
is one great big web.

19:16.588 --> 19:19.957
And now you're telling me that
Molly is entangled in this web?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.928
If that's how you want
to look at it, yes.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.830
The way I see it,

19:25.831 --> 19:27.498
we're a part of each other's lives now.

19:27.499 --> 19:31.502
That means we can help each other.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.804
And I'll be honest, these connections,

19:33.805 --> 19:35.339
we don't understand them that well.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.441
But I do know this:

19:38.677 --> 19:41.646
Abby and Crane had a bond so strong

19:41.647 --> 19:43.014
that they could literally

19:43.015 --> 19:45.750
tug each other back
from different worlds.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.551
They always knew how to reach each other

19:47.552 --> 19:49.520
and how to...

19:49.521 --> 19:51.922
how to pull each other
out of the depths.

19:51.923 --> 19:54.659
That is not something to be afraid of.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.460
That's a gift.

19:58.063 --> 19:59.096
Guys,

19:59.097 --> 20:00.297
I think we've got it.

20:04.336 --> 20:07.238
"February 12, 1778.

20:07.239 --> 20:10.041
"Now is the winter of our discontent."

20:10.042 --> 20:13.377
Washington's men are
encamped at Valley Forge

20:13.378 --> 20:15.413
where they have been
overcome with a sense

20:15.414 --> 20:17.048
of dread foreboding.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.382
I was called to the camp

20:18.383 --> 20:19.984
because the general believed

20:19.985 --> 20:23.220
a malevolent force was
behind this disquiet.

20:23.221 --> 20:24.488
The British had

20:24.489 --> 20:26.057
loosed upon us a monster

20:26.058 --> 20:28.426
that fed off raw human despair.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.430
The way it operated was
to capture a single soldier

20:32.431 --> 20:34.999
and then imprison his soul.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.234
This beast created,

20:37.235 --> 20:38.736
within the soldier's mind,

20:38.737 --> 20:41.672
the illusion of a spiritual trial,

20:41.673 --> 20:45.376
through which it dredged up
all the man's guilt and regret

20:45.377 --> 20:47.044
to feed upon.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.146
Once sated,

20:49.147 --> 20:51.949
the creature was able
to extend its dark powers

20:51.950 --> 20:55.920
and radiate feelings of
despair to all around it.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.154
Feelings so powerful

20:57.155 --> 21:00.257
that many of those exposed

21:00.258 --> 21:02.293
were driven

21:02.294 --> 21:05.029
to the bleakest of ends.

21:07.566 --> 21:10.267
Valley Forge, one of
the darkest chapters

21:10.268 --> 21:11.769
of the American Revolution,

21:11.770 --> 21:14.472
was caused by the thing that has Crane?

21:14.473 --> 21:17.208
So when Washington said,

21:17.209 --> 21:19.210
"These are the times
that try men's souls,"

21:19.211 --> 21:20.544
he was being literal.

21:20.545 --> 21:21.812
I mean, Despair

21:21.813 --> 21:24.707
put a man's soul on trial.

21:24.708 --> 21:26.692
And this is what Crane is
going through right now?

21:26.693 --> 21:27.818
Yes.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.253
If we don't free him soon,

21:29.254 --> 21:31.422
not only will Crane die,

21:31.423 --> 21:33.557
but everyone in the
vicinity of that cave...

21:33.558 --> 21:37.595
- Meaning an army base full of people.
- They'll be driven to suicide.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.374
You say that everyone around me dies.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.436
'Tis true.

21:45.437 --> 21:50.374
I have suffered great loss in my life.

21:50.375 --> 21:53.043
But is that not the plight of a soldier?

21:53.044 --> 21:55.312
For that is what I am.

21:55.313 --> 21:56.714
A soldier,

21:56.715 --> 21:59.083
engaged in the most vital of wars.

21:59.084 --> 22:03.687
So too was the Lieutenant.

22:03.688 --> 22:06.557
She was my partner.

22:06.558 --> 22:08.392
She...

22:08.393 --> 22:12.229
she was my friend.

22:12.230 --> 22:14.832
She knew all too well the risks

22:14.833 --> 22:18.435
of engaging in battle.

22:18.436 --> 22:20.304
And I would die a thousand deaths

22:20.305 --> 22:23.807
if it meant she would
live but one more hour.

22:27.045 --> 22:30.113
But in the end...

22:32.183 --> 22:34.585
...she made a choice.

22:34.586 --> 22:37.521
And what of me, Father?

22:39.657 --> 22:42.326
Was I a soldier, too?

22:46.898 --> 22:49.900
Do you recognize this box?

22:49.901 --> 22:51.535
I spent

22:51.536 --> 22:54.071
200 years in it.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.740
Eating dirt.

22:56.741 --> 22:59.543
Breathing in my own filth.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.445
Because of you.

23:01.446 --> 23:05.482
Because you failed to protect your son.

23:05.483 --> 23:07.985
Henry...

23:07.986 --> 23:09.620
I didn't know you existed.

23:09.621 --> 23:10.888
No.

23:10.889 --> 23:15.359
Because you were too busy soldiering.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.262
Be honest with yourself...

23:18.263 --> 23:21.498
if you had known that
Mother was with child,

23:21.499 --> 23:22.933
would anything have changed?

23:22.934 --> 23:24.835
Would you have done
anything differently?

23:24.836 --> 23:27.905
You're right.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.707
The first duty of a parent
is to protect their child.

23:30.708 --> 23:33.444
A...

23:33.445 --> 23:36.547
A friend reminded me
of that only recently.

23:41.386 --> 23:44.021
I will always regret what
happened to you, Henry.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.891
But if you are a demon,

23:47.892 --> 23:50.394
you chose the wrong face.

23:52.764 --> 23:56.467
For I cherish the opportunity
to speak once more with my son.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.135
To tell him that,

23:58.136 --> 24:01.371
in spite of everything between us,

24:01.372 --> 24:03.507
I always loved him.

24:03.508 --> 24:07.711
I never gave up hope for him.

24:08.847 --> 24:12.516
Every battle I joined,

24:12.517 --> 24:15.219
I did for those I love

24:15.220 --> 24:19.256
and seek to protect.

24:19.257 --> 24:23.060
Especially you, Henry.

24:27.565 --> 24:30.334
My boy.

24:40.612 --> 24:43.480
I know I said I'd be home by now, but...

24:43.481 --> 24:46.717
work just... got crazy.

24:46.718 --> 24:49.461
Yeah, that's okay. Can I watch TV?

24:49.462 --> 24:50.988
Not until your homework's done.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.556
And no pizza.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.359
Tell Claire to heat up
the chicken in the fridge.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.660
You got it.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.896
Moo?

24:58.897 --> 25:00.230
I love you.

25:00.231 --> 25:02.165
Love you, too.

25:12.243 --> 25:14.278
She's eating pizza.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.946
And watching TV.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.948
Sounds like my kind of girl.

25:19.183 --> 25:23.720
She definitely has a mind of her own.

25:23.721 --> 25:25.222
I can't blame her.

25:25.223 --> 25:27.558
Well, you know, it's got to be tough

25:27.559 --> 25:30.327
being the child of a single parent.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.729
Especially one who isn't always there.

25:32.730 --> 25:35.832
It's just you two against the world.

25:35.833 --> 25:37.401
Always has been.

25:37.402 --> 25:39.670
She's my anchor.

25:39.671 --> 25:43.240
You know, my mom,

25:43.241 --> 25:46.944
she... she did everything

25:46.945 --> 25:50.948
to protect Abby and me.

25:50.949 --> 25:53.183
It was just us against the world.

25:53.184 --> 25:56.453
And, uh, she thought
she could do it alone,

25:56.454 --> 25:59.590
but she couldn't.

25:59.591 --> 26:03.894
Not with what she was fighting.

26:05.263 --> 26:07.097
Okay.

26:07.098 --> 26:10.300
Turns out Grace Dixon
managed to turn things around

26:10.301 --> 26:12.235
at Valley Forge with
something she called

26:12.236 --> 26:14.037
"the fire of joy."

26:14.038 --> 26:16.607
Until now, most people thought
that was just a metaphor

26:16.608 --> 26:18.041
for cheering people up, right?

26:18.042 --> 26:19.276
But it turns out

26:19.277 --> 26:21.845
it was a literal fire.

26:21.846 --> 26:23.413
She came up with a flammable compound

26:23.414 --> 26:27.017
capable of incinerating
Despair's webbing.

26:27.018 --> 26:30.354
"Saltpeter, bitumen,
sulphur, hot pitch."

26:30.355 --> 26:32.689
I can handle this, except for

26:32.690 --> 26:34.458
"resin of quicklime"?

26:34.459 --> 26:37.627
- Do you mind if I... Thanks.
- Yeah.

26:40.898 --> 26:43.934
"Resin of quicklime, AKA..."

26:43.935 --> 26:46.970
Damn.

26:46.971 --> 26:49.072
- Nitrated hexamine?
- HMX.

26:49.073 --> 26:50.974
Yeah, it's a military-grade explosive.

26:50.975 --> 26:53.010
I know, a very dangerous,

26:53.011 --> 26:54.778
very illegal military-grade explosive.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.180
- There's no way you're gonna get...
- I can get some.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.651
I know a guy.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.786
I'm not surprised.

27:02.787 --> 27:05.088
Great. Well, now, all we need now is

27:05.089 --> 27:08.759
a delivery device to
concentrate and direct the fire.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.161
Fortunately the specs
listed in this text

27:11.162 --> 27:12.985
match an artifact that
I've been able to track

27:12.986 --> 27:15.265
to the Smithsonian
storage. We can get it.

27:15.266 --> 27:19.269
W-Wait, you have access to
the Smithsonian storage units?

27:19.270 --> 27:21.571
- W...
- Well, if by access

27:21.572 --> 27:23.674
you mean do we have a way
to sneak in and take stuff

27:23.675 --> 27:24.941
without people knowing?

27:24.942 --> 27:27.811
Then, yeah, we got access.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.179
Let's go.

27:31.015 --> 27:32.516
Look, we...

27:32.517 --> 27:34.918
always put everything back.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.288
Mostly everything.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.590
I don't want to know this.
I don't want to know this.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.628
What?

27:44.629 --> 27:46.697
You are loving this, aren't you?

27:46.698 --> 27:48.361
Sneaking around.
Playing cloak and dagger.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.167
You should've heard yourself back there.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.235
"We just need a delivery device,
and then we can go get it."

27:52.236 --> 27:54.037
Oh, hey, we're fighting
a war against evil.

27:54.038 --> 27:56.311
Alex, we helped take down the
Horseman of the Apocalypse.

27:56.312 --> 27:57.646
I know, you keep saying that.

27:57.647 --> 27:59.309
Look, and I'm gonna keep saying it.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.478
I mean, when is that
ever not gonna be cool,

28:01.479 --> 28:03.113
huh?

28:05.883 --> 28:09.686
Alex, did you know that five weeks ago,

28:09.687 --> 28:11.855
I had an interview at
the Library of Congress?

28:11.856 --> 28:14.324
You were gonna leave
the Vault? Sitting around

28:14.325 --> 28:17.027
and reading about all
of these amazing things

28:17.028 --> 28:20.030
just made me realize
I wasn't doing anything

28:20.031 --> 28:23.500
but sitting around and
reading about amazing things.

28:23.501 --> 28:27.304
The stuff in the Vault was
great, but none of it was real.

28:27.305 --> 28:31.374
And I knew that as long as I
stayed inside of that Vault,

28:31.375 --> 28:32.609
it would never be.

28:32.610 --> 28:34.144
Never.

28:36.314 --> 28:40.784
I mean, talk about a
cave of despair, right?

28:40.785 --> 28:43.086
But then Crane comes along,

28:43.087 --> 28:45.756
and all of a sudden,

28:45.757 --> 28:47.357
everything is real.

28:48.926 --> 28:51.962
Did you ever consider that
maybe some of that stuff

28:51.963 --> 28:54.364
is best left in the
pages of those books?

28:56.434 --> 28:57.934
Maybe.

28:57.935 --> 29:00.003
Yeah, but right now,

29:00.004 --> 29:02.072
I'm ready for anything.

29:04.342 --> 29:06.443
Right, this is it.

29:22.894 --> 29:26.596
Look for shelf 21, lot 43A.

29:33.971 --> 29:36.973
I got it.

29:41.512 --> 29:43.947
The Pen Huo Qi.

29:43.948 --> 29:47.117
Tenth century Chinese welding torches.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.286
God.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.054
Someone's coming.

31:19.277 --> 31:21.444
Tell me again how you're
ready for anything.

31:30.373 --> 31:33.275
I've been in foxholes in
Iraq that were friendlier.

31:35.612 --> 31:38.046
Hey, Bunker.

31:38.047 --> 31:39.414
You look good.

31:39.415 --> 31:41.583
You got some nerve, Mills.

31:41.584 --> 31:43.819
Yeah, I've heard that.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.122
Listen, we're looking to score some HMX.

31:47.123 --> 31:48.890
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:48.891 --> 31:50.559
I got some right here.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.794
You thought I forgot about Indiana?

31:54.831 --> 31:57.799
I was kind of hoping you did.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.334
Stand down, Marine.

32:02.505 --> 32:05.273
Second radio battalion Al-Qa'im, 2006.

32:05.274 --> 32:06.642
3-5 Fallujah.

32:06.643 --> 32:09.745
0-4. The real one.

32:09.746 --> 32:12.280
Listen, leather balls.

32:12.281 --> 32:13.915
Do me a solid, cut her some slack.

32:17.887 --> 32:21.223
You're lucky you got
good friends, Mills.

32:24.127 --> 32:25.761
Leather balls?

32:25.762 --> 32:28.230
Takes one to know one.

32:28.231 --> 32:30.932
A hundred a pound.

32:30.933 --> 32:33.568
Cash.

32:36.072 --> 32:38.507
We'll take all of it. Pay the man.

32:43.746 --> 32:45.080
Semper Gumby, right?

32:45.081 --> 32:46.782
Semper Gumby.

32:49.485 --> 32:51.052
Marines.

32:58.695 --> 33:01.496
I'm telling you, the
guy went full-on demon

33:01.497 --> 33:03.632
and I saw pictures of
him when I was researching

33:03.633 --> 33:05.534
the Banneker folio. And guess what?

33:05.535 --> 33:07.736
He's head of Malcolm
Dreyfuss' security detail.

33:07.737 --> 33:09.004
Goes with him everywhere.

33:09.005 --> 33:11.030
So Dreyfuss really does
have demonic connections.

33:11.031 --> 33:11.707
Mm-hmm.

33:11.708 --> 33:13.374
That's something we're gonna
have to deal with tomorrow.

33:13.375 --> 33:14.799
Right now, we got other priorities.

33:14.800 --> 33:15.718
- Yes.
- You loaded up?

33:15.719 --> 33:16.945
Yeah.

33:16.946 --> 33:18.489
The recipe was pretty straightforward.

33:18.490 --> 33:20.682
As far as "fire of joy" recipes go.

33:20.683 --> 33:22.317
Let's go get our man.

33:22.318 --> 33:23.819
So tell me, Father,

33:23.820 --> 33:25.053
who is Diana Thomas?

33:25.054 --> 33:27.122
She is a new ally.

33:27.123 --> 33:29.224
- She a soldier, too?
- She is.

33:29.225 --> 33:30.992
Would you say you've formed a bond?

33:30.993 --> 33:32.527
I would.

33:32.528 --> 33:35.564
She is virtuous of
spirit, noble of character.

33:35.565 --> 33:38.400
So, so, y-you have moved on already.

33:39.869 --> 33:42.537
Less than two months and
you have a new partner.

33:42.538 --> 33:46.675
The person that you cared
about with all your heart

33:46.676 --> 33:49.711
not cold in the grave before
you left Sleepy Hollow.

33:56.052 --> 33:57.786
There was no other way for us.

33:57.787 --> 33:59.788
"No other way."

33:59.789 --> 34:02.124
I think we've heard that before, huh?

34:02.125 --> 34:04.259
Tell me something.

34:04.260 --> 34:07.362
Why haven't you grieved Abigail Mills?

34:07.363 --> 34:08.630
I have.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.132
So, it was grieving that motivated you

34:11.134 --> 34:13.534
to find a whole new collection

34:13.536 --> 34:15.570
of compatriots, huh?

34:15.571 --> 34:18.139
But he won't have to
wait long to grieve again.

34:18.141 --> 34:20.876
Won't be too long before

34:20.877 --> 34:23.844
one of his new partners is killed.

34:23.846 --> 34:27.081
Even worse, I hear

34:27.083 --> 34:30.217
there is a child involved.

34:33.922 --> 34:36.858
Will you have her death
on your conscience, too?

34:36.859 --> 34:39.793
How will you explain that to her mother?

35:10.660 --> 35:13.395
You can see it, can't you?

35:13.396 --> 35:16.631
You bottle your grief

35:16.632 --> 35:20.035
because you know how it will end.

35:20.036 --> 35:22.037
You are guilty.

35:22.038 --> 35:24.572
Always will be.

35:26.809 --> 35:28.977
It is inevitable.

35:32.982 --> 35:35.517
You know what you have to do.

35:42.959 --> 35:45.193
Good-bye, Father.

35:59.128 --> 36:00.595
He's over there.

36:00.596 --> 36:02.029
Oh, wow.

36:04.333 --> 36:07.035
That cannot be comfortable.

36:07.036 --> 36:09.103
Wouldn't want to see
his dry cleaning bill.

36:09.104 --> 36:12.173
Okay, remember I showed
you how to control the flow.

36:12.174 --> 36:13.441
Use the dials and keep

36:13.442 --> 36:15.145
- a steady pressure...
- Alex, Alex, relax,

36:15.146 --> 36:15.977
I got it.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.081
Oh, you got it.

36:20.082 --> 36:22.417
Yeah... Uh, right.
Steady pressure. I got it.

36:22.418 --> 36:23.751
Can you hurry up?

36:37.733 --> 36:39.867
Whatever you're doing, do it faster.

36:39.868 --> 36:41.135
Uh-huh.

36:44.673 --> 36:46.376
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

36:46.377 --> 36:47.308
You sure?

36:47.309 --> 36:49.043
- Easy.
- He's fast.

36:49.044 --> 36:50.311
Keep going.

36:50.312 --> 36:52.814
We'll go put this thing down.

36:59.154 --> 37:00.588
That's it.

37:00.589 --> 37:02.390
The link should be broken.

37:02.391 --> 37:04.926
Okay. Okay...

37:30.252 --> 37:31.853
Move, you bastard.

37:37.092 --> 37:38.926
Hey,

37:38.927 --> 37:41.095
- you okay?
- Yeah.

37:46.368 --> 37:48.503
Crane?

37:50.139 --> 37:51.739
Crane?

37:51.740 --> 37:53.341
Crane?

37:54.910 --> 37:56.611
Crane, wake up.

38:00.949 --> 38:03.551
- He's still alive.
- I don't understand.

38:03.552 --> 38:06.287
We just killed the thing
that had him captive.

38:06.288 --> 38:08.471
U-Unless he's already too
far gone inside his own mind.

38:08.472 --> 38:09.991
Too far gone, what does that mean?

38:09.992 --> 38:12.760
It means he's still
trapped inside the illusion.

38:36.118 --> 38:38.052
So, what? There's no way to reach him?

38:38.053 --> 38:39.487
His soul is adrift.

38:39.488 --> 38:41.689
He's lost his connection to our world.

38:41.690 --> 38:43.591
He needs an anchor.

39:08.183 --> 39:09.350
Mom?

39:09.351 --> 39:10.885
Hey, baby.

39:10.886 --> 39:12.887
I know it's late. Listen, I, uh...

39:12.888 --> 39:15.122
I need you to do something for me, okay?

39:15.123 --> 39:18.793
You know those... those
drawings in your sketchbook?

39:18.794 --> 39:19.794
Yeah.

39:19.795 --> 39:21.496
Yeah, okay, you're so...

39:21.497 --> 39:23.898
good at, uh... at coming up with stories

39:23.899 --> 39:26.033
behind the drawings.

39:26.034 --> 39:28.236
You know the man you drew, Mr. Crane?

39:28.237 --> 39:31.205
What else can you tell me about him?

39:37.045 --> 39:38.846
I think he's a nice man.

39:38.847 --> 39:40.514
Kind.

39:41.683 --> 39:42.917
Funny.

39:42.918 --> 39:44.785
But...

39:44.786 --> 39:47.021
he can also be sad.

39:47.022 --> 39:49.257
Why is he sad?

39:49.258 --> 39:51.425
He thinks that he's alone.

39:51.426 --> 39:53.394
But the funny thing is,

39:53.395 --> 39:56.063
he's wrong.

39:56.064 --> 39:57.965
He's got lots of friends.

39:57.966 --> 40:01.168
But he feels like he's let them down.

40:01.169 --> 40:02.937
Even you, Mom.

40:06.308 --> 40:08.242
But he hasn't.

40:08.243 --> 40:11.679
He gives people something they all need.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.381
What's that, baby?

40:13.382 --> 40:14.615
Hope.

40:14.616 --> 40:17.184
Hope.

40:17.185 --> 40:22.456
He gives everyone hope.

40:28.931 --> 40:30.798
Honey...

40:30.799 --> 40:33.034
okay, this next part
is really important.

40:34.469 --> 40:37.738
If you could tell him
anything right now,

40:37.739 --> 40:39.106
what would you say?

40:41.643 --> 40:44.045
I would tell him...

40:45.647 --> 40:49.183
...don't ever give up hope.

40:51.286 --> 40:53.387
Molly.

41:00.529 --> 41:02.263
Oh, my God.

41:02.264 --> 41:03.898
Oh, my God.

41:03.899 --> 41:04.999
Come here.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.468
I...

41:08.570 --> 41:10.471
Your daughter.

41:10.472 --> 41:13.507
Is she here?

41:13.508 --> 41:15.810
No, I-I called her.

41:15.811 --> 41:17.578
What did you hear?

41:19.748 --> 41:21.182
Abby.

41:22.951 --> 41:26.587
Abby's words.

41:26.588 --> 41:28.923
Molly's voice.

41:33.829 --> 41:36.764
We have much to discuss.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.267
I guess we do.

41:46.375 --> 41:48.676
You know, I got to say,

41:48.677 --> 41:51.512
this has been a night to remember.

41:51.513 --> 41:53.896
I'm guessing this is the first
time you've said those words.

41:53.897 --> 41:56.517
Ha! Joke all you want, Alex.

41:56.518 --> 41:58.586
Yeah, I know you got
a kick out of it, too,

41:58.587 --> 42:00.821
- Okay...
- Didn't you? I mean, how often

42:00.822 --> 42:03.557
do you get to use tenth
century Chinese torches

42:03.558 --> 42:07.495
to cut a man out of a despair
creature's psychic web, huh?

42:07.496 --> 42:09.230
Not often enough.

42:09.231 --> 42:10.364
Exactly.

42:13.568 --> 42:14.835
Look.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.871
It's completely inert.

42:16.872 --> 42:18.305
No response to light.

42:18.306 --> 42:20.007
Yeah. That makes sense.

42:20.008 --> 42:24.078
The creature's dead, so is its webbing.

42:24.079 --> 42:26.347
What are you gonna do with it?

42:26.348 --> 42:28.049
I should probably just dump it.

42:28.050 --> 42:31.986
Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

42:35.891 --> 42:39.694
So, how much would you have missed me?

42:39.695 --> 42:42.730
Like, on a scale of one to devastated.

42:42.731 --> 42:45.166
You know I still have
those torches, right?

42:47.446 --> 42:53.546
