00:03.812 --> 00:06.637
So you gotta work at the radio station on Christmas Eve?

00:07.128 --> 00:10.760
God, it's like doesn't anyone respect the sanctity of that holy night?

00:10.844 --> 00:14.017
We were gonna get drunk and fool around
behind your dad's manger scene.

00:14.749 --> 00:16.766
But this is my first shot at DJ-ing.

00:16.817 --> 00:22.986
If I do well, Hot Donna could be the regular DJ
on Tuesdays from 1 to 5 am.

00:23.495 --> 00:26.092
Every insomniac and burn out in town is gonna know who I am.

00:26.267 --> 00:28.574
Well say hello to your target audience.

00:30.335 --> 00:31.892
Play more Zeppelin.

00:32.896 --> 00:37.048
You guys, I've got some terrible news.
I've just been kicked off the cheerleading squad.

00:37.139 --> 00:39.791
- Oh my little Jesus!
- Oh no!
- Why?

00:41.070 --> 00:44.532
Jackie I know how you feel,
I once got kicked off a cheerleader.

00:46.775 --> 00:48.737
Well I need to get back on that squad.

00:48.856 --> 00:52.542
They might be a bunch of pom-pom waving bitches,
but they're all I know.

00:52.827 --> 00:56.000
Steven, you've gotta take me to the
"Christmas Eve dance" tomorrow night.

00:56.112 --> 00:57.497
Uh no.

00:58.456 --> 01:02.493
I can either dance with, or spend Christmas Eve with you;
cannot do a combo.

01:02.883 --> 01:05.823
Steven, they will never take me back if I don't show up all proud.

01:05.897 --> 01:10.335
If you could just see...that this is something that's...really important to me
then...you'd understand that as my boyfriend...you should go.

01:10.476 --> 01:11.399
Fine!

01:12.434 --> 01:13.530
Please...

01:14.861 --> 01:15.891
Fine!

01:17.205 --> 01:20.088
Hey shut up, if I'm going, you guys are coming with me.

01:20.126 --> 01:23.067
Oh no, cannot go to a high school dance!

01:23.366 --> 01:26.193
I'm gonna be a father soon I gotta start acting more mature.

01:26.652 --> 01:28.381
All right, orange!

01:31.845 --> 01:35.506
Yeah, I'm not going either.
The football team and I have a little disagreement.

01:35.506 --> 01:38.101
They think it's funny to stuff me into a locker,

01:39.413 --> 01:40.739
and I disagree!

01:41.833 --> 01:45.695
Yeah man, the day I graduated, I promised myself
I would never set foot in that

01:45.772 --> 01:47.790
God forsaken place again.

01:47.991 --> 01:49.317
Great news, kids.

01:49.670 --> 01:56.416
Red's gonna be the Santa down at the mall on Christmas Eve,
and I've signed you all up to be his little helpers.

02:00.457 --> 02:05.070
Oh, I'm sorry Mom, we're all going to the
Christmas Eve dance at school.

02:10.151 --> 02:13.496

Don't go away kids,
A Year Without A Santa Claus will be right back.

02:48.218 --> 02:51.158
Man, Heat Miser is badass.

02:51.848 --> 02:53.740
So what time are you coming down the station tonight?

02:53.740 --> 02:57.431
Let's see, the Christmas dance starts eight o'clock,
so I'll just come as soon as it gets lame...

02:57.680 --> 02:59.237
say uh 8:02.

03:00.798 --> 03:05.930
Yeah. Hey y'know what, I'll even bring you something
sweet to munch on - oh and some cookies!

03:06.075 --> 03:07.980
What? Oh, What?

03:08.080 --> 03:09.810
Okay now,

03:11.072 --> 03:12.398
please stand still.

03:12.814 --> 03:15.699
Nobody likes a Santa with plumbers butt.

03:16.572 --> 03:24.299
- Why am I doing this?
- Because I wanna force some good cheer through your clogged
arteries and into your cranky heart.

03:24.661 --> 03:26.796
Yeah, it's like Christmas Draino.

03:28.710 --> 03:31.938
I can't believe you're replacing me as Santa, Red.

03:32.129 --> 03:35.071
Three years and now management says I'm too jolly?

03:36.209 --> 03:38.746
- What do you want, Bob?
- I want to be Santa!

03:38.917 --> 03:41.167
Well, it's Red's turn this year.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.512
Santa could use an elf.

03:43.923 --> 03:47.326
Fine.But I don't wanna sit in the back and
pretend to assemble toys,

03:47.449 --> 03:49.178
I want to participate.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.749
Yeah Bob, you gotta keep your dignity.

03:53.041 --> 03:57.424
If you're in an elf costume,
you don't want that tiny hammer making you look silly.

03:58.079 --> 04:03.384
Steven, for the Christmas Eve dance...What do you think about this tie...
Maybe this jacket...How about a blazer?
- Fine!

04:03.991 --> 04:05.202
Bolo?

04:05.854 --> 04:07.408
- Fine
- Ok!

04:13.976 --> 04:17.839
Okay Brooke, I made a list of all the reasons
why I'm gonna make a great dad

04:17.954 --> 04:18.992
for our little baby.

04:20.373 --> 04:23.372
Okay number one, I am a waiter,

04:25.122 --> 04:28.754
so we'll never run out of straws.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.375
See, look kids love straws

04:32.138 --> 04:36.060
Michel, look I really appreciate the gesture, but no thanks.

04:36.449 --> 04:42.041
Seriously, I think if we just hang out,
you'll see that I'm getting a lot more mature.

04:42.203 --> 04:45.318
I mean, just the other day I watched golf,
and took a nap.

04:46.834 --> 04:50.524
Look Michael, if we weren't in this situation
I think you'd be a really good friend.

04:50.879 --> 04:56.300
I mean you're nice, you bring me stuff,dogs love you.

04:57.477 --> 05:00.359
I just think we should limit our time together...

05:00.883 --> 05:02.035
... to almost none.

05:02.100 --> 05:09.249
Alright, how about we make a compromise between 'almost none'
and what I want to do, which is 'it'?

05:10.575 --> 05:16.224
Okay, if you want, you can help me hang decorations
tonight for the library's Christmas party.

05:16.538 --> 05:19.190
Spend Christmas Eve in a library?

05:19.510 --> 05:21.874
Why don't you just kick me in the 'nads?

05:31.316 --> 05:35.005
Okay, here comes Julie, the head cheerleader.
Now, Steven make me look good.

05:35.516 --> 05:37.995
- Hello Jackie.
- Hello Julie!

05:38.137 --> 05:41.251
This is my boyfriend,
Steven J. Hyde the third.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.905
First two are in jail.

05:46.094 --> 05:47.767
He pretends to be poor,

05:47.885 --> 05:49.730
isn't that funny?

05:50.733 --> 05:54.130
I have to say, I thought you'd be too embarrassed
to show your face here tonight.

05:54.168 --> 05:59.069
Well to be honest, I only came to see your outfit...
so I'd know what not to wear.

06:00.185 --> 06:03.125
Well, let me show you the back.

06:06.876 --> 06:09.732
You're trying to get back on the cheerleading squad;
shouldn't you be nice to her?

06:09.732 --> 06:12.673
Bitchiness is the only language cheerleaders understand.

06:12.770 --> 06:16.287
These are bad girls, they need to be punished, and they know it.

06:18.051 --> 06:21.453
Yeah this is way better than hanging out at the library with Brooke.

06:21.953 --> 06:23.106
Lotta great memories in here.

06:23.801 --> 06:24.898
Did it in there...

06:26.233 --> 06:27.675
did it back there...

06:28.363 --> 06:31.593
got caught by Miss Tompkins doing it down there...

06:32.483 --> 06:34.732
did it with Miss Tompkins over there.

06:35.891 --> 06:39.580
Everyone look for football players, I cannot spend another holiday in a locker.

06:40.204 --> 06:45.451
And this time if I don't show up for two days, come look for me.

06:46.586 --> 06:48.258
Oh my God, Eric Forman?

06:48.654 --> 06:50.844
You look great, I love your shirt.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.127
Really?

06:53.295 --> 06:56.236
I wore this shirt for four years, and no one said a thing.

06:56.796 --> 06:58.814
I guess now you really fill it out.

07:00.265 --> 07:00.900
Thanks.

07:02.540 --> 07:07.039
I'm... I'm like up to seventeen push-ups a night so...

07:07.990 --> 07:12.602
No I don't think that's it.
I think it's because you're not a high school boy anymore.

07:12.803 --> 07:16.493
Yeah, you're eighteen now.
You've seen and done it all.

07:16.771 --> 07:19.541
No, no I... yes, yes I have.

07:20.902 --> 07:22.804
Yeah, that's true...

07:25.618 --> 07:30.000
Hey, you need to watch out okay? Girls are talking to you,
I think there might be a practical joke in the works.

07:30.860 --> 07:35.213
No man, I don't think so.
I think it's cause I graduated.

07:35.501 --> 07:37.455
Hyde, am I cool now?

07:37.455 --> 07:40.856
Well, you're cool like margarine is butter.

07:41.424 --> 07:44.133
Close, but there's a little aftertaste.

08:40.311 --> 08:45.672
You're in the middle of a Christmas Eve rock block
on WFPP with me, Hot Donna.

08:48.405 --> 08:49.961
That was bacon.

08:51.394 --> 08:53.988
I recorded that myself earlier today.

08:54.944 --> 08:58.404
Stay tuned for more Christmas classics with me, Hot Donna.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.730
I'm sorry but that is just too cool.

09:07.671 --> 09:10.497
Okay, Mr. Clause.

09:12.346 --> 09:14.249
Let's hear your best Santa laugh.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.098
You left out a 'ho', Red.

09:20.104 --> 09:23.737
It's three ho's,
did you even read the Santa manual?

09:24.248 --> 09:26.670
Okay Red, I'm sure you'll do fine.

09:26.718 --> 09:35.538
Just remember Santa is a cheerful, jolly fellow,
who never calls a child dumbass.

09:36.523 --> 09:38.098
So what do ya want for Christmas?

09:38.098 --> 09:39.531
I want a slinky.

09:39.531 --> 09:43.451
A slinky?
Oh you'll get sick of a slinky in a day.

09:43.646 --> 09:50.277
I'm putting you down for flash cards.
Math - that's what you're getting for Christmas. Next!

09:50.964 --> 09:54.598
- I want a pony.
- Ponies die.

09:55.443 --> 09:58.615
What you need is a good pair of boots.

09:59.175 --> 10:00.732
Go on keep it moving.

10:01.292 --> 10:03.369
I want a flying car.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.842
I did too when I was your age, kid.

10:05.955 --> 10:07.972
But then the future came and...

10:08.049 --> 10:10.471
took my dreams away.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.699
Just like it's gonna take yours.

10:14.460 --> 10:17.226
Okay, okay little girl, y'know what?

10:17.343 --> 10:21.724
I bet if you're extra good,
you'll get your flying car one day.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.354
Don't listen to her, it's a lie.

10:24.473 --> 10:26.606
Bad Santa.

10:31.597 --> 10:35.577
Yep, life after graduation sure is sweet.

10:36.559 --> 10:38.463
Some days I wake up and I'm like...

10:38.716 --> 10:42.004
"hey I'm having ice-cream for breakfast"

10:42.080 --> 10:45.302
And you know what, I do.

10:46.865 --> 10:49.627
Wow, so what have you two been up to since graduation?

10:49.936 --> 10:52.202
She talked to me, what do I do?

10:52.999 --> 10:55.538
Yeah, I got a librarian pregnant.

10:56.874 --> 10:58.719
Damn, good answer.

10:59.895 --> 11:04.104
So, like Eric,
what are your plans for the future?

11:04.495 --> 11:09.511
Well, I guess I'm just gonna keep on keepin' on, y'know?

11:10.926 --> 11:13.060
I'm thinking about buying a boat.

11:14.749 --> 11:16.940
Okay, we're back and uh,

11:17.384 --> 11:23.438
if my boyfriend's listening you're late and I'm a little worried
you're trapped in a snow drift or something.

11:23.514 --> 11:28.223
So honey if you're cold, I'm with ya baby.

11:28.223 --> 11:31.279
Okay so let's take some requests.
Hello, you're on the air.

11:31.508 --> 11:38.888
Hi, I'd like to dedicate 'He's the Greatest Dancer' by Sister Sledge,
to Eric Forman, the coolest guy at the Christmas dance.

11:40.549 --> 11:43.029
What? He's still at the dance?

11:43.261 --> 11:46.373
Sorry I have to go, he's telling us about his boat.

11:48.435 --> 11:50.108
That sneaky bastard.

11:51.256 --> 11:57.311
Uh, that sneaky bastard Santa Clause is on his way
with a non-stop block of classic Christmas tunes.

11:59.698 --> 12:05.003
And remember you're listening to WFPP with me, Hot Donna.

12:07.471 --> 12:12.719
You hear that Eric Forman? That's not bacon,
that's your ass when I get a hold of you.

12:22.997 --> 12:25.304
Hey, I brought you something sweet to munch on -

12:25.439 --> 12:27.168
oh and some cookies!

12:29.146 --> 12:30.820
Oh man, I knew that was funny.

12:31.562 --> 12:34.215
Man, I can't stop thinking about Brooke.

12:34.767 --> 12:37.477
I mean, both you and me know
that every girl in here wants me...

12:37.657 --> 12:40.540
except for the couple of weirdo's that seem to want you...

12:41.056 --> 12:42.680
but I don't care about any on them.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.763
Look Kelso, are you sure you don't just have a crush
on Brooke because she's a librarian,

12:46.763 --> 12:50.050
and you've seen some librarian layout in Playboy?

12:51.049 --> 12:53.471
Eric, I'm sure that's part of it.

12:55.072 --> 12:57.206
Whatever, I'm going to the library.

12:58.452 --> 13:00.298
Whoa, that felt weird to say.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.744
Steven you don't look like you're having a good time.

13:04.799 --> 13:06.355
I'm not.

13:06.513 --> 13:09.340
I know, but I need you to act like you are.

13:09.696 --> 13:14.193
Just think about stuff you enjoy, like shoplifting or dirty jeans.

13:15.096 --> 13:19.306
Jackie, how come you never to me you
were dating an older man?

13:19.347 --> 13:22.865
Well I guess I was just distracted by the life
I lead outside of cheerleading,

13:23.025 --> 13:27.291
where I do fun and glamorous things,
with my older, mysterious boyfriend.

13:28.835 --> 13:33.216
That's true.
Why just last week, we sat on the couch and had a fight.

13:33.762 --> 13:35.147
I'm jealous.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.630
Ah this dance sucks.

13:41.272 --> 13:44.387
None of the girls remember me,
they all think I'm a waiter.

13:45.877 --> 13:48.961
Hey, I got an idea how you can get these girls attention.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.958
Oh boy,
does it involve me hiding in the girl's bathroom?

13:53.069 --> 13:56.184
- No!
- Okay, we'll try your way.

14:00.032 --> 14:02.397
And that's what really happened...

14:02.751 --> 14:04.541
in Vietnam!

14:05.439 --> 14:10.110
- I don't understand!
- Neither do I, kid. Neither do I.

14:11.106 --> 14:14.335
Okay little boy, time to say goodbye to Santa.

14:15.359 --> 14:17.090
What's an ambush?

14:18.343 --> 14:21.341
It's a pretty bush with yellow flowers.

14:23.413 --> 14:26.930
Kitty I gotta tell ya, I'm good with kids...

14:28.026 --> 14:33.619
I really taught him something.
Y'know I think I'm beginning to feel the Christmas sprit.

14:33.787 --> 14:39.898
Well I'm glad Red, but let's try telling a Christmas story
where nobody gets caught in a fire fight.

14:44.101 --> 14:45.831
Bob what the hell are you doing?

14:45.992 --> 14:48.299
You're depressing the kids, I'm Santa now.

14:49.163 --> 14:51.356
Get out of my chair Bob,

14:51.830 --> 14:55.059
or you're gonna get a candy cane up your chimney.

14:55.606 --> 14:57.048
I'm not moving.

14:57.309 --> 15:01.175
Kitty hold my silly red hat.

15:03.886 --> 15:06.999
You're right, I really am funny.

15:11.428 --> 15:13.966
What do you think you're doing?
Eric you never showed up,

15:14.137 --> 15:15.638
I was worried about you.

15:15.970 --> 15:20.929
Well I'm sorry, I guess I lost track of time,
maybe it's because I am a God to these people.

15:21.893 --> 15:26.390
Donna they like this shirt.
This is a horrible shirt.

15:26.911 --> 15:28.584
I gave you that shirt.

15:30.322 --> 15:32.747
I know, I love this shirt.

15:33.304 --> 15:38.666
Eric I can't believe you let yourself get a swelled head
just because a couple of high school kids think you're cool.

15:38.874 --> 15:43.718
Excuse me, aren't you Hot Donna?
You were so awesome on the radio today.

15:43.845 --> 15:45.575
You really think?

15:48.795 --> 15:49.891
Wait, what's going on?

15:50.349 --> 15:52.079
I think we're in for a treat.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.785
Nice decorations.

16:24.255 --> 16:27.600
I see you're using one of the better tasting glues.

16:29.563 --> 16:31.122
What are you doing here?

16:31.267 --> 16:36.801
Oh I just though instead of having
a fun Christmas Eve somewhere else,

16:36.917 --> 16:39.164
I'd rather have a boring one here with you.

16:39.897 --> 16:43.126
But we could have some fun.

16:43.748 --> 16:45.883
Michael, I've told you before,

16:45.959 --> 16:50.341
just because you come to the library after hours,
does not mean I'm gonna walk around topless.

16:51.245 --> 16:52.976
But it's Christmas.

16:55.937 --> 16:58.533
Oh here let me help you with the decorations.

16:59.074 --> 17:02.070
Pregnant women should not be standing on their tip toes,

17:02.070 --> 17:04.549
cause the baby will come out all cross eyed.

17:06.708 --> 17:11.665
Listen, if you think you're gonna get me interested in you
by being cute and making me laugh

17:14.183 --> 17:16.318
...well it's probably gonna work.

17:17.502 --> 17:22.518
But if you screw this up, I'm gonna ruin your credit
with thousands of dollars in library fines.

17:23.549 --> 17:30.987
Fair enough. Well what say we seal this newfound
friendship with a round of topless ornament hanging?

17:32.416 --> 17:35.762
Okay fine, whatever you wanna do...

17:35.945 --> 17:36.812
topless!

17:42.125 --> 17:45.182
This mall is only big enough for one Santa, Bob.

17:45.182 --> 17:48.527
Tell ya what, you name 5 reindeer and I'll step down.

17:48.571 --> 17:52.146
I can name 5 toes that are gonna be in your ass.

17:52.402 --> 17:57.188
Oh for goodness sake, why don't we stop
calling it Christmas and call it Assmas?

17:58.841 --> 18:01.148
Fine, I'll go.

18:01.416 --> 18:04.415
I only got worked up because Joanne's gone,
Donna's working.

18:04.773 --> 18:09.671
The only people I got at home are my two friends,
Egg and Nog.

18:10.310 --> 18:14.519
Alright fine.
You wanna be Santa, go ahead.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.083
- Thanks Red

18:16.338 --> 18:21.239
Yeah it's all for the best,
I've already eaten about 2 pounds of fake beard as it is.

18:22.035 --> 18:26.303
There he is.
Santa's the one that told me communists hate God.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.447
Gotta go Santa.

18:32.873 --> 18:34.372
Merry Christmas, Bob.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.914
Mrs. Clause needs a drink.

18:39.432 --> 18:42.719
And then I push a button, and it sounds like bacon.

18:44.745 --> 18:48.090
This is so awesome; we're like a celebrity couple.

18:49.113 --> 18:53.710
- It's intoxicating.
- Donna it is a heady brew.

18:54.420 --> 18:57.477
Hey let's go drink beer in front of some sophomores.
Come on.

18:58.423 --> 19:04.630
Jackie, in light of you showing up tonight with your boyfriend,
who by the way is totally cool, and a fox.

19:04.630 --> 19:06.130
Big newsflash there.

19:08.044 --> 19:11.678
I'd like to invite you to rejoin the cheer squad.

19:11.955 --> 19:12.935
Really?

19:20.439 --> 19:22.745
You know I don't think I wanna be a cheerleader anymore.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.283
But we hugged and jumped.

19:26.875 --> 19:31.141
Well I'm gonna have to take back that hug
and jump with a pout and a shrug.

19:35.297 --> 19:38.008
Are you telling me I came to this hell hole for nothing?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.066
No, not for nothing, Steven.

19:40.066 --> 19:42.603
I realised these girls aren't my friends anymore.

19:42.894 --> 19:44.972
I learned something about myself.

19:45.114 --> 19:47.075
Oh, well isn't that ...

19:49.203 --> 19:52.778
Okay, well if it makes you feel any better,
I get to keep the uniform.

19:53.591 --> 19:54.803
Yeah that helps.

19:57.945 --> 20:02.673
You set me up, 'sing a song they'll all love you',
well I'm gonna spend Christmas in a locker.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.642
Oh crap, I'm still on the air!

21:08.944 --> 21:09.751
Hmm.
Jigsaw puzzle.

21:14.170 --> 21:15.729
baseball glove.

21:18.552 --> 21:20.397
Barbie doll tea set.

21:21.390 --> 21:23.813
- Wow, you're good at this.
- Yeah, I've had a little practice.

21:24.336 --> 21:25.490
Ant farm.

21:29.676 --> 21:32.213
It's a Lone Ranger cap gun set.

21:33.305 --> 21:39.732
