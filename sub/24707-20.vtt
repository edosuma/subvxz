00:01.700 --> 00:04.700
- Previously on NYPD Blue.
- You got a job with Apple?

00:04.400 --> 00:06.500
They just offered me an
area associates position...

00:06.500 --> 00:08.900
which is a fancy name
for exactly what I do here...

00:08.900 --> 00:12.800
- but supposably," there's no promotion ceiling.
- That's great, Donna.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.600
I don't want my boss
to hear this...

00:14.500 --> 00:16.800
but maybe you can give us
a hand with this.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.000
- Sure.
- What's in the bag?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.800
My cop's uniform.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.400
- [Screaming]
- Oh, yes. Here he is.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.700
[Squalling]

00:27.700 --> 00:29.700
Here's your son, Mr. Sipowicz.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.500
It's a boy.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.100
- Good morning.
- How's it going?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.200
- How's Mom and little Theo?
- Ah, his colic seems better.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.600
- Oh, great.
- He's less crampy and gassy.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.400
- His stool's firmer.
- Good.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.700
Uh, I think you've showed me
this one before.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.800
- He's such a cutie.
- No, that's last night.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.500
See, to me he seems
less wrinkled.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.500
- Good morning.
- Hey. This guy look like me?

01:10.400 --> 01:14.300
Robbery/shooting at a bar on Sullivan.
Victims transported to Bellevue.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.400
Um, you two go straight
to the hospital.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.900
- James and Greg, here's the bar.
- Okay.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.300
[Medavoy]
Let's go, James.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.500
- He's over there.
- Thanks.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.200
New York City detectives.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.700
- Did you get shot over on Sullivan Street?
- Yeah.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.700
Two white guys,
they shot me and the other guy.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.600
They came in
carrying on real loud.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.700
- I'm in the corner-
- What did these two guys look like?

01:48.700 --> 01:53.800
One was about my height.
The other was, like, 5'8" with a scraggly beard.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.300
So I'm in the corner drinking,
and they carrying on.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.300
I come back from taking a leak,
and I find the one guy...

01:58.300 --> 02:01.300
making advances on the waitress,
holding her down over a table.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.200
And the other guy and the bartender,
they disappeared.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.600
So I ducked back into thejohn
and climbed out the back window.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.000
I dropped down into the alley, and there's
this young guy coming down the street.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.900
He sees me.
He's like, What are you doing?"

02:10.900 --> 02:13.000
I said, I ain't no cat burglar.
Something's going on inside."

02:13.000 --> 02:15.400
So he goes around the corner
to the front.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.300
Tells me to call 911,
but I go to the fire box...

02:17.300 --> 02:19.100
'cause I ain't seen no phone.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.000
Then pow-A shot comes
from inside the bar.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.700
And you know, I'm like trying to peek out the
corner to see what's going on, and blauw"!

02:24.600 --> 02:28.000
There's another shot.
I guess I must've got hit by the ricochet.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.000
The guy that went in there to stop it-
That's him in there?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah. He's shot
much worse than me.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.900
Okay, thanks.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.600
- Take him to the house for a statement.
- All right.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.600
[Woman On P.A., Indistinct]

02:43.000 --> 02:45.300
Hey, Doc.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.000
Pronounced 9:02.
His effects are over there, I think.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.100
- I got it.
- Yeah. Where was he hit?

02:51.100 --> 02:53.500
Mid-sternum.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.400
One behind the ear.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.000
- Did he say anything?
- Nah. He was gone when we got to him.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.800
Oh, my God.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.100
This is Andy's stuff.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.300
This belongs to my son.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.300
Is it Andy?
It's him?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.300
Yeah, Andy.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.400
[Gasps]

03:59.400 --> 04:01.900
Oh. God.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.900
Somebody killed him.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.200
Andy.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.600
Oh, my God.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.000
Oh... God.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.200
Andy.

04:21.100 --> 04:24.200
Oh. Oh, God.

05:39.900 --> 05:43.300
- There's no one here I recognize.
- Okay.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.600
Try this one.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
That boy died
trying to protect me.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.500
Look at this book.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.900
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?

05:59.900 --> 06:01.900
It's so terrible.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.100
I feel so terrible
for Detective Sipowicz.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.900
- We're not made to bury our children.
- No, we're not.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
Please understand.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.200
I apologize for disturbing you
with this now.

06:15.100 --> 06:19.000
Without going into details,
I'm leaving my position.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.900
Donna, if this is about
what happened to Andy's son...

06:23.800 --> 06:27.100
you should take a little time,
let your feelings settle.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.600
This is the product
of a lot of thinking-

06:30.600 --> 06:33.200
courses to prepare
and so forth.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.100
I did quite well...

06:35.100 --> 06:37.500
but still worried my
background was unrealistic.

06:37.400 --> 06:42.300
But this past week my prospective boss
had several meetings with me...

06:42.200 --> 06:44.500
and he urges me
to take the chance.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
What's the job?

06:46.500 --> 06:49.500
I'd be working for Apple Computer
Company in Northern California.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.400
And you'll leave right away?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.700
As soon as wouldn't
inconvenience you.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.300
You know how much
we're gonna miss you.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.500
I have such strong feelings
for so many people here.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.900
Yeah.

07:11.100 --> 07:14.600
[Man] When I told them to pipe down,
they said they were celebrating...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
and that I should too.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.300
And then they laughed,
like there was some big joke.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.800
Yeah, well, maybe meaning they
pulled a stickup somewhere else.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.900
Be glad it wasn't you
that got robbed.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.100
Yeah, that could be-
in how they were talking.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.500
- I'm sorry, Andy.
- Thank you.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.300
We'll get these guys.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.800
I'm sorry, Andy.

07:57.700 --> 08:00.000
How are we doing here?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.900
Come on.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.700
[Fancy]
Robbery's checking patterns on bar stickups.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.100
Narcotics's already got
money on the street.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.300
Aiello's giving us
whatever we need.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.100
What do the witnesses say
happened generally?

08:20.100 --> 08:23.600
When AndyJ. Went in, a tall guy
was sexually assaulting the waitress.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.700
AndyJ. Pulled the guy off...

08:25.700 --> 08:27.900
and then a shorter one
came in from the small office...

08:27.800 --> 08:31.700
next to the kitchen where he had
the bartender opening the safe.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.100
He shot AndyJ. From behind...

08:34.100 --> 08:37.400
and again as he was going down.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.000
This from the waitress.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.200
The bartender pulled the alarm
in the office and locked himself in.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.900
- These guys booked.
- Sure Sylvia don't know?

08:46.800 --> 08:49.000
Yeah. No one has his name.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.600
I'll go tell her and my ex-wife,
see to the arrangements.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.600
Andy, you want Bobby
with you or working the case?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.600
I want him on it all the time.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.400
- I'm not going anywhere, man.
- Them guys from Homicide and Major Case...

08:58.400 --> 09:01.100
- know Simone's running it?
- Yeah, they'll know.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.100
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah. All right, Andy.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.700
I need to talk to you.

09:21.500 --> 09:25.900
- Could you take my coat away to get cleaned?
- Yeah.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.200
My concern-
Did I get this kid killed?

09:31.200 --> 09:34.200
- Andy.
- I was a big shot.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.500
Give this kid
all kinds of lessons.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.900
He goes in without a gun.
What kind of teaching did I give him?

09:39.800 --> 09:42.700
- You taught him how to help people, Andy.
- He went in without a gun.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.600
He wasn't authorized
to carry a gun yet.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.000
Then he should wait outside with that
gutless bastard snuck out the window...

09:47.000 --> 09:49.600
- dial 911 and wait!
- None of us would've done that.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.500
What did I do, huh?

09:51.600 --> 09:54.000
- What did I do?
- All right.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.200
I don't want to- I don't want to look
at these guys coming into the house.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.000
Believe me, Andy. These guys resist when
we collar up, and they got a big problem.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.300
Look at these guys in
court with their suits on...

10:06.300 --> 10:08.500
showing the jury their crosses!

10:08.500 --> 10:10.800
Phony bastards-
They better not make one mistake!

10:10.800 --> 10:13.300
Sit there-And his mother
having to sit there...

10:13.300 --> 10:15.300
knowing what they did to him!

10:15.200 --> 10:17.500
Come on. Don't do this
to yourself, man.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.300
You gotta help me, Bobby.
I want these guys dead.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.000
All right, Lonnie.
Thanks for your cooperation.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.300
- I guess I should've tried to do more.
- We'll be in touch.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.100
[Martinez]
Okay, thanks for the information.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.200
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

10:55.700 --> 10:59.100
Hey. The radio car's bringing in a homeless
guy they picked up under the F.D.R.

10:59.100 --> 11:03.000
Fits our description, Bobby.
Guy had a.38 on him.

11:02.900 --> 11:06.600
And Robbery's got a bar owner for us
to talk to. Got stuck up two weeks ago.

11:06.500 --> 11:11.300
- Two guys, similar M.O.
- Yeah, good.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.200
How's Andy holding up?

11:13.200 --> 11:16.100
How do you expect, Diane?

11:48.200 --> 11:52.300
Andy, is something wrong?
Why are you back?

11:56.400 --> 11:59.500
AndyJr. Tried to stop
a stickup in a bar.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.100
He got shot twice and killed.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.500
Oh. Oh, Andy.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.600
I gotta tell his mother...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.800
see to the arrangements.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.000
Why don't you just stay
with us for a minute and-

12:20.000 --> 12:22.700
I gotta tell her. I don't want her
hearing from strangers.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.800
- Make the arrangements.
- Andy.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.700
Is the baby's colic better?

12:26.700 --> 12:28.700
- Yeah, he's fine.
- How's your tear-

12:28.700 --> 12:32.000
- Your discomfort down there?
- I'm fine, Andy. I'm fine.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.300
Stay with the baby.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.900
And so we're looking
at similarities...

12:53.900 --> 12:55.800
between how your bar got robbed
several weeks ago, Mr. Barks...

12:55.800 --> 12:57.700
and this one in our
precinct this morning.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.400
Off your robbery, I guess I should
be glad that no one in mine was shot.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.600
Your complaint says these guys were hassling
some customers before they robbed the place.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.800
They were hitting
on a couple of women.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.100
One of them must've
been 60 years old.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.800
Let's talk about their appearance.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.200
I reported they were both guys
who were real dirty.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.100
They looked like they had
slept in their clothes.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.100
Well, we'd like you to take
a look at our mug books.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.000
- See, I did this with the last robbery.
- Yeah, and I'm not saying...

13:19.900 --> 13:23.400
that you could've prevented what happened today,
but we were told with this previous incident...

13:23.200 --> 13:25.600
you got halfway through one of the
mug books and then said you had to leave.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.700
We would like you to look
through all of the photos...

13:27.700 --> 13:30.200
that fit your description
of these guys.

13:30.200 --> 13:34.000
- Okay?
- Yeah, all right.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.000
- All right.
- You got an address on this one?

13:43.200 --> 13:44.700
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.700
He had this buried
in his shopping cart.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.500
- I found it. I didn't do anything wrong.
- Just relax.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.000
- Is he identified?
- Yeah. Right here.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.400
- Okay. Put him in 2.
- Yes, sir.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.600
Hey, Greg.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.100
Bobby's in with that bar owner.
Get him on this when he's finished.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.800
- Got it.
- Pick up the bullets
that killed AndyJ. At the morgue.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.700
- Have Ballistics check 'em against this gun.
- All right.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.200
Okay.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.700
What is it?
Is he hurt?

14:19.700 --> 14:21.600
He's dead, Katie.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.800
No.

14:25.900 --> 14:28.300
No. No.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.100
He was in my precinct...

14:39.100 --> 14:41.200
trying to stop a stickup...

14:41.100 --> 14:44.000
- and he got shot.
- Could it be a mistake?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.200
No, Katie. I saw him.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.400
Oh, God.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.800
What am I gonna do?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.300
Andy was everything to me.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.500
I know.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.000
Why was he there?

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
I don't know.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.300
We didn't have no lesson set up.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.600
Oh, you know why?
He was gonna pick up his uniform.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.200
The receipt's in his effects.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.900
He said he wound up spending
all day with you the other day...

15:23.900 --> 15:27.800
and he took his uniform
to a tailor near your precinct...

15:27.700 --> 15:29.700
to have his sleeve shortened...

15:29.700 --> 15:31.700
and I knew it was an excuse.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.800
He just wanted to show you
he had it.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.700
They shot him trying
to help somebody?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.600
He tried to stop a robbery-
and a girl was getting assaulted.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.400
That's how he is.

15:50.400 --> 15:54.000
That's what he's
always been like.

15:55.500 --> 15:59.600
I'll see to the arrangements.
Do you want the funeral at Scotty's?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.400
You're going to see
to the arrangements?

16:01.500 --> 16:04.300
I took care of him for 23 years!

16:04.200 --> 16:06.700
I'm only saying I'll handle
the financial part.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.900
I thought Scotty's
'cause it's close to your sister's.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.700
He was so sweet.

16:16.600 --> 16:21.900
He warmed me up from inside,
just seeing him smile.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.700
I'll contact you
with the arrangements.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.200
[Weeping]

16:46.900 --> 16:48.800
I'll call.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.600
What kind of a name is that,
Scott- Bernat"?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.000
Bernah."The T" is silent.
It's a French name.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.600
- You from France?
- My family was.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.200
Anyone in your family
ever been in jail?

17:04.200 --> 17:06.599
'Cause you're in felonious possession
of a deadly weapon here.

17:06.599 --> 17:10.099
- Look, I don't do well in institutions.
- Mm-hmm.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.599
I found that gun.
I don't know anything else about it.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.500
I don't bother nobody.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.200
I lost my job. I was a pressman
at the newspaper there.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.700
That's why I'm out on the streets.
I lost my job.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.700
Well, you fit the description
our witnesses gave.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.800
Your appearance is all messy, the way
they said, plus, no one can verify...

17:22.700 --> 17:25.800
- your whereabouts at the time of the homicide.
- I was looking for cans.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.800
I don't even like guns, but I thought
I could get 50 bucks for it.

17:28.800 --> 17:33.200
We test your hands for powder residue,
are we gonna find out you shot that gun?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
- No, sir.
- Did you see anyone else with it?

17:34.900 --> 17:38.900
- No?
- Look, I don't do well in institutions.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.600
I mean, I know I've made mistakes.
I know that.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.500
I used to be a pressman
at the New York Times.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.800
You didn't see anyone else
with that gun?

17:43.900 --> 17:46.300
- You found that gun in the gutter?
- I swear I did.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.600
I didn't see anybody else.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.000
What about service and casket,
Mr. Sipowicz?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.800
Any preferences?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.100
I'm a cop-
I don't have a lot of money...

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
but I want to do
the right thing.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.200
Even within
the lower price parameters...

18:11.200 --> 18:13.700
I know we can find
something tasteful.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.000
With visitations there'll
probably be a problem.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.100
My former wife's sisters
hate me.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.700
Sometimes we find
if the different sides...

18:22.600 --> 18:25.200
pay their respects
at different hours-

18:25.200 --> 18:28.900
I wouldn't want a cop coming by,
I'm disrespectful not being here.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.800
Or if the sitting room
from viewing room B"...

18:31.700 --> 18:35.200
could be funneled into
viewing room 'A"-

18:35.100 --> 18:37.100
which also has
its own sitting room-

18:37.100 --> 18:40.500
so that we'd have two sitting rooms
and one viewing room.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.400
Something like that.

18:42.400 --> 18:47.400
It's somewhat more expensive, because
it prevents us from using the other room.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.300
Do it like that.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.000
He tried to stop a robbery
without a gun.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.800
You worry you made him feel
he was ready when he wasn't...

19:02.700 --> 19:07.300
or he concentrated the wrong things
with what you taught.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.100
This type of concern.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.800
He was just getting
his cop's uniform.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.700
They were altering
the sleeves.

19:16.700 --> 19:19.600
I want him buried in that.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.100
Lieu?

19:32.100 --> 19:34.300
The bar owner from that similar
pattern robbery last week?

19:34.300 --> 19:39.500
Says he gets back to his place and is explaining
to one of the regulars why he opened up late.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.500
The customer says that he thought
the two guys that pulled the stickup...

19:41.500 --> 19:43.100
he'd seen living
out of a trailer...

19:43.100 --> 19:46.000
across from a warehouse over
on Avenue D" near the Con Ed plant.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.300
He didn't give
a statement before?

19:48.300 --> 19:50.900
He didn't want to lose drinking time
over a $70 robbery.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.900
Anyway, this trailer is like a block or two
away from where we picked up...

19:53.900 --> 19:56.400
- this bum that found that.38.
- Match on the gun, Lieu.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.600
Find these guys.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.900
Take Diane.

20:18.500 --> 20:23.100
- Excuse me. You can't park that car there, pal.
- We're police.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.100
- This your place?
- Yeah. Why?

20:25.100 --> 20:27.600
- You got two men living in that trailer?
- Yeah, why? What'd they do?

20:27.600 --> 20:30.200
- They still live there?
- Yeah. I gave them some day work.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.200
They said if I let them
live in the trailer...

20:32.100 --> 20:34.400
that they'd keep an eye on the place
during the weekends and the nights.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.900
- I'd like to get rid of them.
- Why? What are they doing?

20:36.800 --> 20:39.400
I just don't like
the hours that they keep.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.800
I don't like what they're doing inside
that trailer. They got undesirables in there.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.900
They put a padlock
on the damn trailer- my trailer.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.900
- They're in there now?
- Yeah. They were in there about 20 minutes ago.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.100
- Is this the only entrance right here?
- Yeah, right through that gate.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.900
We gotta question these guys.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.100
- Why don't you just keep your men on this side?
- Yeah, sure.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.300
15th Squad
to 15th Squad supervisor. K."

21:04.300 --> 21:07.000
[Fancy]
15th Squad supervisor standing by. K."

21:07.000 --> 21:10.500
Be advised, subjects are
at location. They're in a trailer.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.600
We're at 14th and 'D. "'K."

21:12.600 --> 21:14.800
[Fancy]
10-4. We're on our way.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.200
At least maybe
we get these scumbags.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.000
I'm going in there now.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.400
What are you talking about?

21:23.300 --> 21:25.400
- This is how I want to do it.
- Backup's gonna be here in five minutes.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.300
I don't want you
coming inside.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.900
- I don't want you coming inside, Diane.
- Bobby, I'm backing you up.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.000
You want to back me up,
stand right there.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.500
Right there, Diane.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.700
Bobby, what are you doing?

21:48.100 --> 21:51.800
Police! Don't move! Police!

21:51.800 --> 21:54.100
Bobby!
Bobby, are you okay?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.700
- Don't you move! Don't you move!
- Get down! Get down!

21:56.600 --> 21:58.800
- [Man Groans]
- Give me your hands.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.800
Under the mattress, Diane.
Check under the mattress. Shut up!

22:01.700 --> 22:05.600
- Got a gun.
- You were trying to shoot me? You scum!

22:05.600 --> 22:08.300
- You were trying to shoot me?
- No, I was asleep!

22:08.300 --> 22:11.500
[Groaning]

22:11.400 --> 22:14.700
Gotta call for an ambulance.
Put your hands behind your back.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.300
Put your hands behind your back.
[Pants]

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Why didn't you wait
for your backup?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.200
They made us, boss.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.000
- We had to move.
- You were made, but they stayed in that trailer.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.600
They made us going in.
They were ready to book.

22:44.600 --> 22:48.000
So you weren't holding
a trial out there?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.400
I want to interview this guy, Lieu-
see if he did this homicide.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.200
And I don't want his statement excluded
'cause he went from here to the hospital...

22:54.200 --> 22:56.700
where his running buddy's
already admitted with a fractured skull.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.900
The guy with the fractured skull
pulled a shotgun on us.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.300
- What were we supposed to do, kiss him?
- Don't go over the line, Bobby.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.400
People are gonna
look hard at this.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.500
I don't think we should tell Andy
anything until we know where we're at.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.900
Go ahead.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.300
Don't walk 'em,
but don't give 'em nothing to hit.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.500
Why didn't you wait for backup?

23:20.500 --> 23:22.600
- Oh, don't you start with that crap.
- That's crap?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.500
Being part
of an execution?

23:24.600 --> 23:27.200
No one got executed.
Hey, Diane, I told you to stay outside.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.700
I'd like to know
why that was too.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.800
Why don't you make a list
of all your misgivings, Diane?

23:30.800 --> 23:34.500
- Maybe I.A.B. Can beat it out of me.
- Bobby!

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
Bobby, what's going on?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.600
You better work this
by yourself.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.100
No.

23:43.100 --> 23:45.100
Please.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.500
[Clears Throat]
Come on. Let's do this.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.000
Vince Gotelli been around?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.100
No, Detective.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.100
Open it at your convenience.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.900
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.000
[Sobs]

24:53.600 --> 24:56.200
I don't know how to say
how terrible I feel, Andy.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.100
When a person loses
a dad or a mother...

24:58.100 --> 25:02.800
it's an honor to be a delegate,
to let 'em know how the union can help.

25:02.800 --> 25:06.400
- But this here-
- Give all his benefits to his mother, Katie.

25:06.300 --> 25:09.100
All right.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.100
I talked to the Hackensack delegate.
He's figuring it out.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.700
It looks like the insurance
package looks substantial.

25:14.700 --> 25:18.900
And he also said that they'll assign
a policewoman to his mom till after the funeral.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.700
Good.

25:20.700 --> 25:23.400
On our end, I just have to know
where AndyJr.'s gonna be waked...

25:23.400 --> 25:25.200
and the cemetery
where he'll be buried.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.300
Scotty's Funeral Home
and the V.A. Cemetery on Long Island.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.300
- Out at Calverton?
- Yeah.

25:30.300 --> 25:35.000
Yeah, 'cause the Highway's
providing a motorcycle escort.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.500
The Police Foundation,
Cop Shot and the line organizations...

25:38.500 --> 25:40.100
are putting up
reward money, Andy...

25:40.100 --> 25:43.200
and if either of these mutts
are federal fugitives...

25:43.200 --> 25:45.100
the government'll add 75 grand.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.800
Now we also want you
to know-

25:47.700 --> 25:49.700
if for any reason
you're short...

25:49.600 --> 25:51.600
we'll advance the funeral expenses
against your retirement annuity.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.700
I don't need an advance.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.200
Tell our people
in Hackensack...

25:56.200 --> 25:59.200
that all the benefits
should go to his mother, Katie.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.200
Okay, Andy.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.100
I thank you for your help.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.300
How are you doing, Andy?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.500
I was wondering what
the developments were.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.400
Well, we're looking
at some things.

26:23.500 --> 26:27.100
I don't want to get your hopes up
till we see if they're going anywhere.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
- You spoke with Sylvia?
- Yeah.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.800
And I spoke with his mother,
and I made the arrangements.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.200
All I got left's the I.D. -

26:36.600 --> 26:38.500
which I'm reluctant for.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.900
- I don't know why the hospital isn't enough.
- Yeah.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.700
It doesn't make sense.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.800
Bobby's out
working on something?

26:46.800 --> 26:49.500
Yeah. He and Diane are
following some things out.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.900
- All right.
- Okay.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.000
I appreciate your thoughts,
and I wish you luck.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
[Sighs]

27:52.800 --> 27:55.700
- So you know Marty, like,
what, six or seven months?
- Yeah, ballpark.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.600
Like I say, he gave me
that ride from Akron.

27:57.600 --> 28:00.700
Right- Both like your cocktails,
start hanging together-

28:00.700 --> 28:02.700
[Man]
Yeah. Main basis was guarding that place.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.000
This Daniels asked us
to guard it.

28:04.900 --> 28:08.200
Says we live in the trailer,
ward off theft.

28:08.100 --> 28:12.300
- You and Marty?
- I mean, that's how this thing
went crazy, Detective.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.300
We didn't know youse was a cop.
We thought you was gonna kill us.

28:14.300 --> 28:17.000
That's why your buddy
pulled out that shotgun there...

28:17.000 --> 28:20.300
- and you had that piece underneath the mattress?
- Yeah, absolutely. Right.

28:20.200 --> 28:25.500
Last Tuesday, Mike, you and Marty pull
a stickup over in a bar on Second Avenue?

28:25.300 --> 28:29.600
- No, I didn't hold up no bar.
- Jesse's Club over on Second Avenue?

28:29.400 --> 28:31.900
No I never heard of it.
You know, I never robbed nobody.

28:31.900 --> 28:34.400
- You pulled a stickup this morning?
- No.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.000
- No?
- No! What are you doing?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.600
- What are you doing?
- That was a cop's son that you killed today, Mike!

28:39.600 --> 28:42.000
No, no. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I didn't kill nobody.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.800
- Same M.O. Same guys
that robbed Jesse's Club last week.
- I don't know nothing about-

28:47.700 --> 28:51.400
We got a witness from Jesse's Club
that recognized you doing that job!

28:51.200 --> 28:54.000
He recognized you
going into that trailer.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.500
We found the gun that killed
my partner's kid...

28:55.500 --> 28:58.100
two blocks away from where
you're living right now.

28:58.100 --> 29:01.800
All right, Jesse's Bar. You know,
that was 70 bucks, but no one got hurt.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.100
Today, I don't even know what
you're talking about. I wasn't there.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.900
You got the wrong guy.
When did this happen, anyway?

29:07.800 --> 29:09.700
- 9:00 this morning.
- Aw, for gosh sake.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.600
I was in jail. I mean,
I was in the system all night.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.500
I didn't get back
to the lot...

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
until, like, maybe 20 minutes
before you broke in on us.

29:17.500 --> 29:21.100
- What were you in the system for?
- Five bucks' worth of crack.

29:20.900 --> 29:23.600
It's dumb. I'm not even
big in that. I'm a drunk.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.700
Let me tell you something.

29:27.700 --> 29:32.300
Your story's straight, you're still looking
at a collar forJesse's Club last week.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.400
Maybe Marty's
who did this here.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.800
You know, the guy
you busted his skull.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.500
- I mean, this was a murder today, right?
- That's right.

29:39.500 --> 29:42.400
Well, you would help me out last week
if I help you on this one, right?

29:42.300 --> 29:45.300
If you didn't do this with Marty,
who could he have done the stickup with?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.200
Well, he hangs with a guy
sometimes, Freddy Keyes.

29:47.100 --> 29:49.900
- You know, he looks halfway like me.
- Spell it.

29:49.900 --> 29:52.800
Keyes. I don't know
how it's spelled.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.400
The guy's a badass too-
you know, guns, glue.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.700
Him and Marty, they could've
done a murder, easy.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.800
If your story is wrong, Mike,
I am coming back here for your ass.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.900
Square up, Detective.
I'm not gonna lie to you...

30:09.800 --> 30:12.700
about being in the system!

30:19.000 --> 30:20.900
I'll put Freddy Keyes
through B.C. I...

30:21.000 --> 30:24.300
and check the arraignment part
on this Mike's release time.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.100
Yeah.

30:29.300 --> 30:32.200
Let me run this through the boss
and make that call.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.100
Available for walks
and meetings.

30:41.700 --> 30:44.200
Get home?

30:44.100 --> 30:46.200
What's going on with this?

30:46.200 --> 30:50.400
We're getting somewheres, Andy.
No answers yet.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.900
What do you got?

30:54.200 --> 30:57.400
Ballistics matched
a weapon we recovered...

30:57.400 --> 30:59.200
with the bullets
that killed AndyJ.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.500
Where's the gun from?

31:01.500 --> 31:04.700
Some whacked-out guy
had it in the bottom of his grocery cart.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.100
Then we got tipped
that these two guys...

31:07.100 --> 31:10.200
who pulled a similar pattern
bar stickup last week-

31:10.200 --> 31:14.200
They're living out of a trailer one or two blocks
from where this skell found the gun.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.100
Now, these two guys, Andy-
they're like half-assed watchmen...

31:16.100 --> 31:18.200
at this used furniture warehouse.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.300
One looks like his
alibi's pretty good-

31:20.200 --> 31:21.800
he says he was
in the system overnight-

31:21.900 --> 31:24.400
but he makes his running buddy
as a candidate.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.600
We grab up
the running buddy too?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.600
He's in the hospital.
I fractured his skull when we collared him.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.600
You fractured his skull?

31:31.600 --> 31:35.900
Andy, on this other thing-
I couldn't be sure they fit.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.700
I'm not sure now.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.600
The guy's partner
could be framing the guy-

31:39.700 --> 31:43.400
- looking for a walk on this other stickup.
- What hospital's this guy in?

31:43.300 --> 31:48.000
What are you gonna do, Andy? You gonna
go over there and get yourself locked up?

31:47.900 --> 31:51.000
- What hospital?
- I'm not telling you.

31:52.900 --> 31:54.800
Andy.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.100
- Come on, Andy.
- You let go of me.

32:09.800 --> 32:14.500
Sarge? Yeah. It's Simone. Sipowicz might
be coming to your desk in a couple seconds.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.400
Just don't let on
that you're talking to me, all right?

32:16.400 --> 32:21.500
Yeah, Sarge. He's all torn up. Now, he's
looking to find what hospital the guy's at...

32:21.300 --> 32:23.800
that we might like
for his boy's homicide.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.100
Yeah. Look, I know-
I know he's at Roosevelt.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.600
I just don't want Andy
to know that.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.500
Just tell him you haven't
gotten the paperwork yet...

32:30.500 --> 32:34.100
and that the Borough
is in charge of the guard detail.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.900
Then he'll probably go
to Bellevue first, so that'll give me...

32:35.900 --> 32:37.900
some time to go over to Roosevelt
and talk to this other guy.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.700
Okay? Yeah, thanks.

32:40.700 --> 32:45.300
So this guy's looking to put
AndyJ.'s murder on his buddy.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.800
- Diane catch you up?
- Mm-hmm.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.200
His alibi's good, Bobby.
He was released 10:15 this morning.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.100
B.C.I. 's getting back
on Freddy Keyes.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.800
I want to go to the hospital and talk
to the partner, see what he's got to say.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.900
- Just let me run to the john.
- Diane, would you mind if wejust got going?

33:00.400 --> 33:03.500
Boss, don't ever let anyone
tell you chivalry's dead.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.700
- What's up?
- I told Andy where we were on the case.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.800
He's going out
to look for this guy.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.000
Simone and Russell with the 15th Squad,
here to talk to this mutt.

33:29.900 --> 33:33.100
- Can you sign my memo book?
- Yeah, sure.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.500
Listen. A bald, heavyset guy
with no overcoat...

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
might come
onto the floor here.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.900
- Want to give me a heads-up?
- Is the guy a problem?

33:39.800 --> 33:42.100
Just let me know
if he shows.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.400
Look at this. Marty.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.600
Marty, wake up.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.900
Detective Simone.
This is Detective Russell.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.200
You fractured my skull, pal.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.100
I got a compound skull fracture!

34:03.100 --> 34:05.100
We need to talk to you
about that bar stickup.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.800
Next time you and me talk's gonna be
for brutality in court over money damages.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.800
Yeah, yeah, Marty.
You go ahead.

34:10.699 --> 34:13.600
You sue me for coldcocking you
when you went for your gun.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.199
- I could've blown your brains out.
- I didn't stick up a bar.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.000
And you busted in
without a warrant.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Marty, your buddy gave you up,
so save everyone's time...

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
on not sticking up
that club last week.

34:22.900 --> 34:26.600
What we're looking at here-
The club last week, no one got hurt.

34:26.500 --> 34:29.600
The one you did with Mike-
the one today-a kid was murdered.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.000
Who got murdered?
I didn't stick up any bar today.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.800
The company was different maybe?
'Cause this last one was with Mike?

34:36.699 --> 34:39.100
The one today was with who?
Some psycho glue sniffer?

34:39.100 --> 34:42.300
If Freddy pulled the trigger,
say it and save your life.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.199
And if you're talking
about Freddy Keyes-

34:44.100 --> 34:46.100
if Freddy pulled that stickup today-
I have no knowledge about it.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.300
- All right, where were you this morning?
- Not with Freddy.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.199
I haven't seen Freddy in a week.
Oh, my head! My fracture!

34:53.199 --> 34:57.100
Where were you, Marty? You think
this is as bad as your head can hurt?

34:56.900 --> 34:59.600
Mike was in the system today,
so we know he didn't do the stickup.

34:59.500 --> 35:04.200
- If it was you and Freddy,
put the gun in Freddy's hand.
- Where did it go down?

35:04.100 --> 35:06.700
You know where it went down.
9:00 this morning on Sullivan Street.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.600
I was nowheres near
Sullivan Street.

35:08.600 --> 35:11.200
I was grabbing a wink's purse
on 10th Avenue then.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.500
I threw her I.D.
Under the trailer.

35:13.500 --> 35:17.400
Get her name off her I.D.,
and ask her what time she got robbed.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.200
- I have never shot a person in my life.
- Shut up.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.900
[Groans]
You fractured my damn skull!

35:31.800 --> 35:33.700
- Is that the guy you told me about?
- Yeah. Relax.

35:33.700 --> 35:35.500
- Let me talk to him.
- Sure.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.900
Andy? Andy, look, I don't think
this guy in there did it.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.800
What did he say?

35:39.800 --> 35:42.400
Well, he locks himself onto
a robbery charge on a story...

35:42.400 --> 35:44.300
- that's really easy to check.
- So we're no place?

35:44.300 --> 35:47.700
- We'll work off the weapon.
- You said the guy that found
the weapon's a nut job.

35:47.500 --> 35:51.300
- Well, we go back over there.
We canvass the place.
- We're no place.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.000
- I gotta go to the morgue.
- Let me go over there with you, Andy.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.300
Give your keys
to the department car to Diane.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.800
She can take it
back to the Squad.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.700
- No.
- Andy, I don't want to be a demon for exercise...

35:59.700 --> 36:01.700
but you think a walk might help
before you go over there?

36:01.800 --> 36:04.400
- Maybe stop at a meeting?
- That's twice you told me that. I got good hearing.

36:04.300 --> 36:06.400
I don't need you
telling me things twice.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.500
- Andy, don'tjump on Diane.
- That's okay.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.700
I apologize.

36:11.700 --> 36:15.200
I gotta go make the I.D.,
get that taken care of.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.900
Yeah. Yeah. I understand.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.400
- What's up, Sarge?
- Hotline phone running
out of here or the Borough?

36:30.400 --> 36:33.400
Uh, the Borough.
We'll have the number in the press release.

36:33.400 --> 36:37.100
- All right?
- Any chance this Freddy Keyes
might go somewhere?

36:36.900 --> 36:38.700
Yeah.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.800
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Bobby.

36:40.900 --> 36:45.400
Your cheerful countenance, Arthur-
I assume we're still in the dumper.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.500
Yeah.

36:47.500 --> 36:51.100
All right. Are we sure that Sipowicz
contacted his family?

36:50.900 --> 36:54.400
- His boy's name can go in the press release?
- Yeah, he's contacted them.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.300
That's reward,
hotline phone number-

36:56.300 --> 36:58.500
That's it.
We've covered everything.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
All right, Arthur.

37:01.700 --> 37:04.800
- Call me with some good news, huh?
- I'd like to.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.800
- God, she's a pretty girl.
- She's leaving.

37:10.700 --> 37:13.300
End of a perfect day, huh?

37:13.300 --> 37:17.600
- I understand you're leaving us.
- That's right, Inspector.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.700
- You have lots of good luck. Arthur.
- Well, thank you, sir.

37:20.600 --> 37:24.100
- Good-bye, Lieutenant.
- Bye, Donna.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.700
I bet you're
gonna do great.

37:26.700 --> 37:30.100
- Could I impose on you to be mailman?
- Sure.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.000
Good-bye.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.800
- You take care.
- [Sniffs]

37:48.400 --> 37:51.600
- I'm leaving, Greg.
- What do you mean?

37:51.600 --> 37:54.400
I've explained it all
in a letter I wrote you.

37:56.500 --> 38:00.900
Donna, what are you talking about?
Where are you going?

38:00.800 --> 38:02.800
It's all explained
in my letter.

38:02.800 --> 38:07.500
I, uh- I just want
to tell you good-bye...

38:07.400 --> 38:10.000
and the good thoughts
I have for you.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.500
Donna, please,
just don't go like this.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.400
It's the way I want to.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.900
Today's such an unhappy day.

38:23.400 --> 38:26.200
Make yourself happy, Greg.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.800
It's a sin not to try.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.300
Hey, what's up?

38:38.300 --> 38:41.100
- Donna quit.
- She quit?

38:41.000 --> 38:44.700
Yeah. She, uh-She said
she explained it in a note.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.500
These are from Donna.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.900
That's for you, James.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.800
I guess she left notes
for all of us.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.800
- Detective Solomon?
- Over here.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.900
- Joe Solomon.
- Andy Sipowicz from the 15th.

39:41.900 --> 39:43.900
They said you'd be coming.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.900
I'm really sorry
about your son.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.800
I'd like to get
the I.D. Over with.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.900
Your boss sent over a photo
and I checked it.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.600
As far as I'm concerned,
you made the I.D.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.200
Sign there and here.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.300
Is there progress
on the case?

40:02.300 --> 40:04.700
They recovered the gun.

40:04.700 --> 40:07.100
The guys they were looking at
didn't pan out.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.100
He was trying
to stop a stickup.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.400
I'll have a good thought for you
collaring these guys.

40:21.400 --> 40:25.200
Element of inexperience.
You wish you'd taught him better.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.900
Now he winds up in there.

40:27.900 --> 40:31.500
He's lying in there now,
under a sheet.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.300
Anyways, uh-

40:34.700 --> 40:36.800
This is all I need.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.100
Andy.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.000
How's the baby?

41:05.100 --> 41:07.400
- He's fine.
- How do you feel?

41:07.300 --> 41:10.300
It hardly hurts at all.
You don't have to ask anymore.

41:11.900 --> 41:15.600
I, uh-We had a couple of suspects,
but they didn't pan out.

41:18.600 --> 41:21.200
- Did you see Kate?
- Yeah.

41:21.200 --> 41:24.000
I talked with her, and I took care
of the arrangements.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.700
Cop at the morgue was considerate
in terms of the I.D.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.600
I think I'll take a walk.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.500
Do you want me and the baby
to come with you?

41:38.100 --> 41:41.200
It's trying to rain.
You stay with the baby.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Andy.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.000
Let us be close.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.900
We all have
to get through it.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.000
Take care of the baby
till I get through this.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.400
- All right.
- [Baby Coos]

41:57.800 --> 42:00.300
I'm gonna take a walk.

42:33.800 --> 42:37.100
Whiskey. Line 'em up.
