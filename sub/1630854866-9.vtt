WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:07.967
<i>We are going
to escape this place today.</i>

00:07.967 --> 00:10.010
Are you coming with us?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.095
Take cover!

00:20.229 --> 00:22.356
<i>You know
it's not your fault.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.734
You killed him to save us.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.152
I am not your brother.

00:26.152 --> 00:28.070
No, you're worse.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.656
<i>I was about to give up.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:33.033
Luckily, you left us
a little clue.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.329
<i>I must send you
to the Burgue</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:39.790
as my emissaries.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.752
<i>I've been asked
to present a peace treaty</i>

00:42.752 --> 00:44.378
to Parliament
on behalf of the New Dawn.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.381
I hope you know
what you're doing.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.176
Any fae that wants passage
to Tirnanoc.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.886
They're letting us sail home?

00:51.886 --> 00:54.555
<i>There's two ships now,
there'll be more to follow.</i>

01:06.901 --> 01:07.985
Berwick!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.823
Vignette, wait,
I can explain. No!

01:14.033 --> 01:17.369
The Black Raven respects you, Comrade.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.455
Are you ready to lead them?

01:20.498 --> 01:23.626
<i>Philo, what do
you know about the New Dawn?</i>

01:23.626 --> 01:25.711
If this is the New Dawn...

01:26.796 --> 01:28.798
...it's not peace they're after.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.052
They're bringing a revolution.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.372
Darius!

02:51.881 --> 02:53.883
Darius!

03:44.975 --> 03:46.352
Tourmaline!

04:18.717 --> 04:21.136
How'd you do that?

06:07.451 --> 06:08.577
<i>Vignette here?</i>

06:08.577 --> 06:10.162
She went after the Raven.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.248
She's no idea
what she's walking into.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.750
What, do you want us
to go after her?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.168
We'd never find her.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.171
Tourmaline might.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.090
Nah.

06:21.090 --> 06:22.424
Not with magic.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.634
Why not?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.302
It's too dangerous for her.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.554
If you'd seen what I've seen,
it's just too dangerous.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.099
Danger's coming, Darius,
whatever we do.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.142
- Where is she?
- Out.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.061
Look, if you ask her,
she'll do it.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.355
But I'm begging you,
Philo, don't ask.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.148
It's the New Dawn.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.734
They're already here.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.113
The carnage at the docks?
That was them.

06:44.113 --> 06:47.616
Oh, shit.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.326
So, it's a revolution.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.290
If we don't stop it, the army'll
come in and the Row will burn.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.418
Stop a revolution? How?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.797
I spoke to Millworthy.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.590
There's still
a chance for peace,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.300
if somebody stops the Sparas.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.720
You mean kill it.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.891
So, all that talk about
how you're done taking sides

07:12.891 --> 07:14.434
against the fae.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.690
We kill this thing,

07:19.690 --> 07:21.775
imagine how many more
lives we save.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.409
So, you've come
to help us, then?

07:30.409 --> 07:33.245
Is that
so hard to believe?

07:33.245 --> 07:35.414
We are not conquerors.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.332
We didn't come here

07:37.332 --> 07:40.169
to destroy this place,
but to set it free.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.589
I've heard that before.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.258
I was told you robbed
the military trains

07:46.258 --> 07:47.926
for medicine. Why?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.428
Something to do.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.805
You saw people in need,

07:51.805 --> 07:54.975
and you risked your life
to help them.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.643
We are no different.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.983
The Black Raven respect you.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.360
If you join our cause,

08:05.360 --> 08:07.446
the others will follow.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.615
What do you need the Raven for?
You've got an army.

08:09.615 --> 08:12.117
In Ragusa, not here.

08:13.577 --> 08:17.289
You think the New Dawn
is some foreign invasion?

08:17.289 --> 08:20.334
No. We are already here.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.711
Wherever people believe
in the idea

08:22.711 --> 08:25.422
of fairness, of freedom
for everyone,

08:25.422 --> 08:27.966
we are there already.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.639
You expect to defeat the Burgue

08:33.639 --> 08:34.848
with an idea?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.811
The Pact also laughed.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.397
They are not laughing now.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.698
The Sparas is New Dawn?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.284
A magnificent creature.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.078
One of the last of his kind,

08:56.078 --> 08:59.831
and still he fights with us
for a better world.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.125
By ripping off heads at random?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.127
The Sparas is not
a mindless monster.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.255
No more than you or I.

09:06.255 --> 09:09.424
He's a creature of strategy.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.343
He takes life only when he must.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.387
What about Dahlia and Bolero?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.764
They fought for faefolk,
and they were killed by a fae.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.308
Small-minded traitors.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.602
No one can be allowed to stand

09:20.602 --> 09:23.063
in the way of what is coming,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.774
fae or human, no one.

09:28.860 --> 09:32.322
But those who stand with us,

09:32.322 --> 09:34.491
they will not just be spared,

09:34.491 --> 09:37.119
they will be delivered.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.079
From guns and jails

09:39.079 --> 09:41.540
and hatred and fear.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.209
From sickness and poverty

09:44.209 --> 09:45.711
and despair.

09:45.711 --> 09:49.131
They will finally
have a chance to live.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.051
But maybe

09:53.051 --> 09:56.138
you aren't ready
to fight for that.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.933
Not for yourself.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.896
You have been abused
and betrayed...

10:06.982 --> 10:08.317
...and afraid,

10:08.317 --> 10:11.611
and your heart has been
shattered again and again.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.239
You are in so much pain,

10:14.239 --> 10:18.535
maybe you don't believe
you deserve real freedom

10:18.535 --> 10:20.704
with real choices.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.043
But what about
the ones you love?

10:26.043 --> 10:28.920
Don't they deserve it?

10:28.920 --> 10:32.716
What would you do
to give them that better world?

10:41.058 --> 10:43.352
I see what
you mean about her.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.939
I shouldn't have doubted you.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.232
You've been through hell.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.234
It's good to have you back.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.530
You are back, ain't you?

10:55.530 --> 10:58.075
How did she find
all these people?

10:58.075 --> 11:00.702
Most of them are from here.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.412
Joined the New Dawn in prison.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.206
Until the Sparas
broke 'em all out.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.459
Is it here?

11:08.627 --> 11:10.670
Is it one of those humans?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.425
Could be.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.843
Could be any of them.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.639
First I saw it was
down at the docks.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.474
Incredible.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.060
Incredible?

11:25.060 --> 11:27.104
It was a slaughter.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.106
I didn't say
it was pretty,

11:29.106 --> 11:32.901
but I'm glad it's on our side.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.694
So...

11:34.694 --> 11:37.114
are you?

11:37.114 --> 11:39.866
On our side?

11:39.866 --> 11:41.868
Don't tell me you missed me.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.703
No, I didn't.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.705
You're a stuck-up little prig,
and you get on my tits.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.166
- Hey.
- But I don't have
to like you, now, do I?

11:50.544 --> 11:53.088
That's the difference
between you and me. I know

11:53.088 --> 11:57.342
there are more important things
than how I feel.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.137
I don't like you,
but I will fight with you,

12:00.137 --> 12:02.556
as long as you are here
fighting for those who can't.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.141
You are one of us.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.435
I'd put my body on the line
for you, and you'd do the same,

12:06.435 --> 12:08.645
because we are nothing
without each other.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.231
That is what solidarity is.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.776
That is the world
I want to live in.

12:18.363 --> 12:19.781
Me, too.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.119
I'm with you.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.669
The chancellor murdered?

12:32.669 --> 12:36.006
Ships burned in the harbor?
This was you, wasn't it?

12:36.006 --> 12:38.425
This was the New Dawn.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.553
Oh, it's
a lovely picture.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.930
Will you miss
your brother very much?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.349
You are far from
your guards here.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.603
Answer her.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.564
How many of our comrades
have been killed

12:52.564 --> 12:55.275
with Burguish rifles, hmm?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.319
If the Burgue thought
they could aid our enemy,

12:57.319 --> 12:58.737
and that there would be
no price to pay...

12:58.737 --> 13:00.780
You think that murder and chaos

13:00.780 --> 13:03.325
brings you closer to peace,

13:03.325 --> 13:04.826
you don't know the Burgue.

13:04.826 --> 13:08.497
They need to know
the cost of refusing us.

13:08.497 --> 13:12.459
Besides, we both know
how persuasive

13:12.459 --> 13:14.836
Comrade Imogen can be, hmm?

13:14.836 --> 13:17.506
You can't possibly expect me
to address Parliament now,

13:17.506 --> 13:20.050
- after this.
- Oh, I can assure you, Comrade,

13:20.050 --> 13:23.678
after this, they will
hang on your every word.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.520
If you want peace so much,
get it yourself.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.484
Well, you could back out.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.861
I have no way to force you.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.699
But you've seen what will happen
here if peace fails.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.455
You left your brother
in one of those fields.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.308
This city chased us out.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.477
Why should we save it?

14:12.477 --> 14:14.729
There's no "we" involved.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.900
It's clear you are
the only voice they'll hear.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
But do you think
I should refuse to speak?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.906
I think I'm tired.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.700
I'm tired of imposing on you

14:26.700 --> 14:28.827
when my home is
just steps away.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.454
- You're not imposing...
- Knowing I can't go back

14:31.454 --> 14:33.248
there because being here
with you is the only reason

14:33.248 --> 14:35.375
I'm not locked up in the Row.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.795
But mostly I'm tired

14:38.795 --> 14:40.505
of holding my tongue.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.342
On my account?

14:44.342 --> 14:47.470
We both know you won't
abandon this city

14:47.470 --> 14:49.764
to be slaughtered.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.813
And you'll save the lives
of others, too, if you can,

14:56.813 --> 14:59.691
because that's who you are.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.860
Besides, the Burgue
is worth saving.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.112
I've seen much
of the rest of the world.

15:04.112 --> 15:07.240
Compared to the Burgue...

15:07.240 --> 15:08.992
it's worse.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.577
I knew
the Burgue's cruelty

15:10.577 --> 15:12.621
long before
you arrived next door.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.874
Maybe I should let it burn.

15:21.296 --> 15:24.132
After Ezra,
what's one more mortal sin?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.479
What are you doing here?

15:37.479 --> 15:39.022
Oh, you're back, then. Good.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.024
Just who I needed to speak to.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.486
And I bet Darius told you
not to ask me.

15:46.738 --> 15:50.116
He's scared after what happened
with the mirror.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.161
My little trip
into the Gloaming?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.415
I thought we agreed
you wouldn't wander off alone.

15:57.415 --> 16:00.543
Doesn't matter,
does it?

16:00.543 --> 16:02.253
Yeah.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.130
Well, um...

16:04.130 --> 16:06.549
Philo was just leaving,
weren't you, Philo?

16:06.549 --> 16:07.676
What do you need?

16:09.135 --> 16:10.470
Ask me.

16:12.138 --> 16:15.100
The Sparas in your visions,

16:15.100 --> 16:17.018
where does it land?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.813
Across the square, and then
it comes this way by foot.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.606
Where are you standing exactly?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.692
- Me?
- Mm.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.026
Right here. Why?

16:28.029 --> 16:30.490
Right. Darius, you'll take

16:30.490 --> 16:33.743
a position
just inside the window.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.079
I'll take a position out here.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.374
When the Sparas lands,
I'll draw its attention...

16:42.252 --> 16:43.837
...and blast it
through the window.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.964
Blast it? With what, exactly?

16:45.964 --> 16:47.799
I was thinking a machine gun
should do the trick.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.634
Oh, silly me for asking.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.303
I'll just go and get my spare
machine gun, shall I?

16:52.303 --> 16:54.681
You got inside
Vignette's head, didn't you?

16:56.057 --> 16:58.601
You managed to bring her here.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.647
You want me to do it again
with the Sparas?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.816
You want me to draw it here?

17:07.110 --> 17:08.695
So we can kill it.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.281
Or-or-or maybe
she doesn't do that,

17:11.281 --> 17:13.032
and then it won't
come after her.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.325
No, no, it's coming, Darius.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.827
I think we've established that.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.414
But I can't.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.291
I mean,

17:21.291 --> 17:23.376
obviously I would,
but I-I can't do the spell.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.503
I need a bit of its hair
or something.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.923
Well, that's a shame.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.508
Nice try, though,

17:30.508 --> 17:32.385
but we're moving on.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.305
Would a tooth work?

17:35.305 --> 17:36.806
A tooth?

17:40.018 --> 17:41.978
Yeah, it would.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.464
Ow! But we are diplomats.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.840
No, you're not.
You're accomplices

18:10.840 --> 18:12.342
to murder and treason.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.469
Miss Spurnrose and I knew
nothing, you have my word.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.805
A fucking Puck's word.
Fancy that.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.556
It's true, Mr. Millworthy.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.600
These attacks were New Dawn.
Kastor confessed it to us.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.976
Did he now?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.561
Yes, they thought the Burgue
would be more amenable

18:23.561 --> 18:25.104
to a peace treaty
with a gun to its head.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.940
- Well, then they were fools.
- Yes,

18:26.940 --> 18:28.358
but so are you if you think

18:28.358 --> 18:30.276
arresting us
will stop the violence.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.320
- Is that a threat?
- No.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.489
Please listen.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.075
The New Dawn
is desperate and angry

18:37.075 --> 18:38.326
and have concluded
that death is preferable

18:38.326 --> 18:39.661
to continued oppression,

18:39.661 --> 18:42.455
which makes them an enemy
with nothing to lose.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.791
They don't just kill
enemy troops,

18:44.791 --> 18:48.169
they slaughter entire families
and leave them to rot.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.758
Mr. Astrayon and I

18:53.758 --> 18:56.010
had many reasons
never to return to the Burgue,

18:56.010 --> 18:58.930
- but we came back to save it.
- Thank you,

18:58.930 --> 19:01.099
but I think it's
a little bit late.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.725
What if we could stop
further attacks?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.646
There are to be further attacks?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.107
I don't know,

19:09.107 --> 19:10.525
but, Kastor,

19:10.525 --> 19:14.279
surely there's a way of you
reaching your comrades.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.865
Tell them to cease fire,

19:16.865 --> 19:18.616
or there will be no peace.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.085
Perhaps...

19:29.085 --> 19:31.921
Perhaps, possibly,
there is a way we could...

19:31.921 --> 19:34.257
send them a message.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.971
You already have us
under guard here.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.807
What could you possibly
have to lose?

20:20.011 --> 20:21.846
Tourmaline?

20:25.308 --> 20:27.185
What happened?

20:29.020 --> 20:31.147
Oh.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.607
Of course.

20:32.607 --> 20:35.443
They talked you into joining
their glorious revolution.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.321
How'd you know?

20:38.321 --> 20:39.822
Philo.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.824
Please don't tell me
he's trying to stop them.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.493
Well, they're trying
to start a war.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.869
No. No, listen.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.205
We were wrong
about the New Dawn.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.665
They're not what we thought.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.042
I've seen what they are,
and the sight doesn't lie.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.335
They've already
liberated Ragusa.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.878
They can do the same for us.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.673
So, you're going to join them
even when you know

20:56.673 --> 20:59.008
that thing of theirs
is going to kill me?

20:59.008 --> 21:01.636
The Sparas only kills
when it has to,

21:01.636 --> 21:04.138
when people try and stop it.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.432
Oh.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.435
So, that's what it is.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.688
Why?

21:13.314 --> 21:14.732
What are you doing?

21:14.732 --> 21:16.234
We're trying to stop it.
We're setting a trap.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.569
- What? No. You can't...
- Stop, stop.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.949
We've been through this.
This is my fate.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.660
Fuck fate.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.829
You don't think you can
change your destiny?

21:29.163 --> 21:31.124
You're not even trying
to fight it?

21:31.124 --> 21:34.377
I've seen the horror
your revolution is gonna bring.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.421
And, for you, that might be
a price worth paying,

21:36.421 --> 21:38.381
but you don't get to make
that choice for the rest of us.

21:38.381 --> 21:41.009
You certainly don't get
to make it for me.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.762
Or have you forgotten what war's
like for people on the ground?

21:44.762 --> 21:46.806
I haven't forgotten.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.475
I wish I could,

21:49.475 --> 21:53.229
but I remember freedom, too.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.898
I remember what it was like
to not be afraid

21:55.898 --> 21:59.027
every second of every day.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.904
Do you remember that?

22:01.904 --> 22:05.575
You're making a mistake.

22:05.575 --> 22:09.037
This isn't the end.

22:09.037 --> 22:12.957
The choices we make
echo into the Gloaming.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.084
But what does that matter?

22:15.084 --> 22:18.171
Folks are suffering here
and now, and we can change that.

22:18.171 --> 22:21.132
We still have a choice.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.635
And this is mine.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.347
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm trying to concentrate.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.266
- Tourmaline...
- Just go.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.610
<i>You expect me</i>

22:40.610 --> 22:42.278
to take the word
of a Critch witch

22:42.278 --> 22:43.863
who had a fucking vision?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.406
Well, she's never been wrong,

22:45.406 --> 22:46.949
but if you've got a better idea

22:46.949 --> 22:48.785
of how to hunt a Sparas,
I'm all ears.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.536
The whole of the Burgue
is on the hunt.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.372
- Army, too, not just police.
- Oh.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.916
Well, you won't be
needing me, then.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.168
- Let me know how it goes.
- Wait.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.379
Look, just hold up, all right?
For fuck's sake.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.092
Let's say I do believe you
about these visions.

23:04.092 --> 23:06.636
Let's say you know where
the monster's gonna show up.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.471
What kind of born idiot
would I be

23:08.471 --> 23:10.306
to hand some Critch
a machine gun?

23:10.306 --> 23:13.017
Fuck off. What am I
supposed to do,

23:13.017 --> 23:15.853
- kick it to death?
- I'm not saying I won't do it.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.147
- Ah.
- I'm saying just

23:18.147 --> 23:19.565
give me a fucking minute here.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.151
Well, the good news is,
that's the easy part.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.195
There's more?

23:24.195 --> 23:26.823
There's one stop
we need to make first.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.908
Let's go.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.954
There's a code
with my mark,

23:32.954 --> 23:35.581
so that our comrades will trust
that you speak for me.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.292
But why must Agreus
be the one to go?

23:38.292 --> 23:41.963
Because humans
are not allowed on the Row.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.589
And what do you want me to say?

23:43.589 --> 23:45.049
The truth.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.051
That our mission
has been threatened, and

23:47.051 --> 23:48.886
they are to send you back
with new orders.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.596
And they'll stop the attacks?

23:52.014 --> 23:55.434
- If they decide that is best.
- And if they decide not?

23:55.434 --> 23:58.604
Then we will spend the war
in a Burguish prison.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.948
This isn't right,
for Martyr's sake.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.410
It's the only way.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.163
Well, go on, then.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.753
I'm sure Berwick will
be happy to help his partner.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.547
He was just saying so
the other day.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.424
"You'd never let us down,"
he said.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.596
What the fuck do you want me
to say, Dombey?

24:33.556 --> 24:35.141
You're right.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.770
Berwick would still be alive

24:39.770 --> 24:42.190
if I hadn't gotten
in my own way.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.905
You should look away.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.636
That it?

25:16.349 --> 25:17.683
Thanks, Kip.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.602
Best leave this to us, yeah?

25:19.602 --> 25:21.062
Of course.

25:21.062 --> 25:24.023
Well, what the fuck
is going on here, Sergeant?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.234
I'm working a case, Constable.

25:26.234 --> 25:27.652
What the hell
are you lot doing here?

25:27.652 --> 25:29.946
You're letting
that Critch bastard

25:29.946 --> 25:32.406
into our precinct
near one of our own?

25:32.406 --> 25:35.701
Oh, now, you listen
to me, Thatch.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.871
Right now this Critch bastard

25:38.871 --> 25:42.250
is our best chance of catching
an even bigger bastard.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.797
The Row. Dawn.

25:47.797 --> 25:50.800
Right. Well, you looked at the
body. Get the fuck out of here.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.218
You're letting him go?

25:52.218 --> 25:54.095
He's got a signed pass
from Balefire.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.596
We can't touch him.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.268
Always a pleasure, lads.

26:03.813 --> 26:07.650
I don't believe it.
Dombey working with Critch.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.610
I'll work with Critch and worse

26:09.610 --> 26:11.779
if it means catching
this filthy beast,

26:11.779 --> 26:14.282
and it's Sergeant Dombey
to you, Cuppins.

26:21.372 --> 26:23.499
I don't want you to go.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.042
I'll deliver
the message

26:25.042 --> 26:27.128
and then I'll come
straight back.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.672
Agreus, I don't want
to hold my tongue either.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.590
I know I cut you.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.553
Please.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.308
Tell me how to heal it because

26:40.308 --> 26:42.852
I've never felt this empty
in my entire life.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.358
I'm sorry if you felt that I was

26:49.358 --> 26:52.611
trying to "own" you or...

26:52.611 --> 26:55.781
exert power over you.
That was never my intention.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.578
I never meant to make you
feel that way.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.915
I believe you.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.419
But you are wrong.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.716
I'm not proud of the things
I did in my past.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.593
They haunt me daily.

27:17.178 --> 27:19.138
For you to suggest
that I did them

27:19.138 --> 27:20.556
to be like the men
that oppressed me,

27:20.556 --> 27:22.892
or that-that it makes me
worse than them...

27:24.518 --> 27:25.728
No.

27:27.897 --> 27:31.067
I did them for my freedom.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.361
To be free.

27:38.616 --> 27:41.202
You did what you had to do
to survive.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.748
I am glad of it.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.761
All cuts heal with time.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.264
All right, come on.

28:14.777 --> 28:15.945
Hyah.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.170
Where'd you slip off to?

28:33.170 --> 28:35.798
Doesn't matter.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.717
Our new comrades
were worried about you.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.679
I told them not to.

28:41.679 --> 28:43.889
You're part of the fight now.
Right?

28:43.889 --> 28:46.100
I am.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.981
But what about the ones
who didn't sign up for a fight?

28:53.899 --> 28:56.235
The ordinary folk that just
wanted a quiet life.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.903
Are we doing right by them?

28:59.488 --> 29:02.450
Oona wanted a quiet life.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.785
She didn't sign up
for what she got.

29:04.785 --> 29:08.247
I know. I miss her.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.711
I wonder what she would have
thought of the New Dawn.

29:15.588 --> 29:18.048
Seeing how bad
things have gotten,

29:18.048 --> 29:20.634
she would've been the first one
to sign up with them.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.973
This is our first real chance
to change things, Vini.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.143
What if we don't win?

29:30.352 --> 29:33.105
We will win, Vini,

29:33.105 --> 29:35.566
or at least die trying.

29:35.566 --> 29:37.026
Open up the gate.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.861
Open it up.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.488
Come on, step back.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.822
Stand back.

29:41.822 --> 29:42.907
That's our messenger?

29:42.907 --> 29:44.783
Come on, move back.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.204
Excuse me, young man.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.872
Could you tell me the way...?

30:31.872 --> 30:33.541
Could you please...?

30:36.252 --> 30:38.462
Please tell me the way
to St. Titania's Tavern.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.018
Thank you.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.497
Get you a drink, your lordship?

31:13.497 --> 31:15.499
I'm actually meeting
with someone.

31:15.499 --> 31:16.792
Right you are, sir.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.253
Pix or faun? Male, female,

31:19.253 --> 31:21.880
- or...
- Just, uh, a beer.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.674
Thank you.

31:41.984 --> 31:43.902
Mmm.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.988
I'm actually waiting
for someone.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.990
Yeah. Me.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.453
You've been followed.

31:52.453 --> 31:55.164
Of course I have.
I've got a message.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.374
Mm. It's not for me to see.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.548
And where are you off to?

32:04.548 --> 32:06.717
Stay and have a drink with me.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.975
Where are you taking me?

32:17.269 --> 32:19.813
The Row disgusts you that much?

32:19.813 --> 32:22.566
The way you dress like them,
talk like them.

32:22.566 --> 32:25.486
You think that makes you better
than the rest of us?

32:25.486 --> 32:28.030
Seductive, I suppose.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.282
The New Dawn's appeal.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.534
That we're not to blame
for any of our hardships.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.620
No, it's someone else's fault.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.497
That we shouldn't try to

32:36.497 --> 32:39.291
improve civilization, no,
we should tear it down.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.961
And why should we try to improve
ourselves with education

32:42.961 --> 32:45.172
and create things of value?

32:45.172 --> 32:48.509
No, no, we should
hand out wealth equally,

32:48.509 --> 32:51.345
regardless of your labors.

32:51.345 --> 32:53.097
It's lazy.

32:53.097 --> 32:56.684
It's a lie, and it will change
absolutely nothing.

32:58.102 --> 33:00.104
So, according to you,

33:00.104 --> 33:02.356
we should play by their rules,

33:02.356 --> 33:04.566
and try and beat a system
that is stacked against us?

33:04.566 --> 33:05.693
Yes.

33:05.693 --> 33:07.736
Change is slower,

33:07.736 --> 33:09.780
but you inherit more than ash.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.449
Will I see it
in my lifetime, though?

33:12.449 --> 33:14.702
Would my grandchildren?

33:16.495 --> 33:18.580
Then for me, ash it is.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.919
They'll take care of you now.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.037
You never really wanted
peace, did you?

34:00.956 --> 34:03.459
Why did you force us to come?

34:03.459 --> 34:06.378
I'm told you bring a message.

34:10.924 --> 34:14.344
Kastor's code,
so you know I speak for him.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.847
Is that what he told you
this meant?

34:17.848 --> 34:20.267
Clever man, Kastor.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.980
Such finery.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.943
Even now, you can't see
how foolish you look.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.820
You're making
a terrible mistake.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.030
He sent me with a warning.

34:33.030 --> 34:36.325
No, he sent me a warning.

34:36.325 --> 34:38.494
That Comrade Imogen
has threatened

34:38.494 --> 34:40.579
to back out
of addressing Parliament,

34:40.579 --> 34:42.623
and that...

34:42.623 --> 34:44.666
I cannot allow.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.889
They held a knife
to my throat.

34:58.889 --> 35:00.432
I'm really sorry, sir.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.975
You...

35:01.975 --> 35:04.311
No!

35:09.817 --> 35:13.487
<i>So, you're telling
me that your plan failed?</i>

35:14.738 --> 35:17.199
I said that if we
threatened them with arrest,

35:17.199 --> 35:19.701
they'll be forced to send
a messenger, which they did,

35:19.701 --> 35:21.203
but our man lost the trail.

35:21.203 --> 35:23.163
Just so I understand,

35:23.163 --> 35:24.456
we are no closer to learning

35:24.456 --> 35:26.583
the New Dawn's
strength in numbers.

35:26.583 --> 35:29.503
Unfortunately not, but I don't
believe that Mr. Astrayon

35:29.503 --> 35:32.130
or Miss Spurnrose,
however good an actress she is,

35:32.130 --> 35:34.007
knew of the attacks in advance.

35:34.007 --> 35:36.885
They're traitors, regardless.
Hang them and send in the army.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.596
Quite right.
We should raze Carnival Row

35:39.596 --> 35:41.139
and be done with this.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.851
Yes, that's certainly the most
drastic option, gentlemen,

35:43.851 --> 35:46.603
but might I remind you
of the upcoming election?

35:48.438 --> 35:51.024
It could be to both
your advantage

35:51.024 --> 35:54.152
and your public standing

35:54.152 --> 35:56.572
if you were to say

35:56.572 --> 35:59.241
your parties did
everything they could

35:59.241 --> 36:02.369
to avoid war on our own soil.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.248
For our party,

36:06.248 --> 36:09.585
war is always a last resort.

36:09.585 --> 36:12.462
As it is for ours.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.923
We must first exhaust every

36:14.923 --> 36:16.758
diplomatic option.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.725
Very well, Mr. Millworthy.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.811
If the New Dawn
still intends to sue for peace,

36:27.811 --> 36:29.813
we will hear them out.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.527
I'll see it's handled, gentlemen.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.492
Wonderful. It's lovely.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.828
I'll just go
and get the big bowl out.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.747
Well done. Thank you.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.124
Aren't you forgetting something?

36:49.124 --> 36:51.585
- Dombey will come through.
- With a machine gun?

36:51.585 --> 36:53.795
You're putting our lives
in the hands of that copper?

36:53.795 --> 36:55.797
He's a prick.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.090
But I trust him.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.217
Tell him about Vignette.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.721
What's she talking about?

37:25.285 --> 37:28.288
Fly inside the fog
until we're clear of the guns.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.505
So it's true, then.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.386
You shouldn't be here.

37:42.386 --> 37:44.346
Neither should you.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.808
What's in the bags?

37:47.808 --> 37:49.685
Come closer and we'll show you.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.311
You police again?

37:51.311 --> 37:52.813
Thought you'd seen the light.

37:52.813 --> 37:53.981
And you're killing police now?

37:53.981 --> 37:56.483
Did I?
Which one was that?

37:56.483 --> 37:58.151
All you coppers
look the same to me.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.820
Stop.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.780
Just take this. I'll catch up.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.156
Please.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.951
Don't let him get in your head.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.078
Not now.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.705
Just go.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.081
Go on.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.877
So you're New Dawn now.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.508
There were
troops on those ships.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.468
I know.

38:24.469 --> 38:25.804
They fucking betrayed us.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.597
I know.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.683
But you're running
right back to them.

38:30.684 --> 38:33.353
I thought you'd had enough
of hiding and hating yourself.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.689
Fuck all that.

38:35.689 --> 38:37.816
What can I do about that?

38:40.027 --> 38:41.903
Stopping a killer,

38:41.903 --> 38:44.156
that's what I've always done.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.035
Saving the people I love.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.414
That's what I want to do.

38:53.749 --> 38:55.500
That's right.

38:56.752 --> 38:58.503
What they're doing, Vignette,

38:58.503 --> 39:00.714
with this revolution,

39:00.714 --> 39:03.216
it's not right.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.635
I'm asking you.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.263
Don't go with them.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.265
Please.

39:14.311 --> 39:16.521
But what is right, Philo?

39:19.274 --> 39:23.612
I won't watch the people I love
suffer and die.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.115
I've done it once
and I won't do it again.

39:29.618 --> 39:33.455
Hope is so frightening.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.169
But now I have it.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.466
The world can be different.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.219
But the only chance
we have of seeing it

39:47.219 --> 39:49.387
is by fighting for it.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.098
Okay.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.017
Forget about me.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.394
You're choosing them
over Tourmaline?

40:02.317 --> 40:04.736
I'm doing this for Tourmaline.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.657
And for you.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.433
From Leonora.

40:41.148 --> 40:42.649
Hyah.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.531
Where's Agreus?

40:50.574 --> 40:51.908
For you.

40:52.993 --> 40:54.744
He should be back by now.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.914
Open it.

41:29.446 --> 41:32.032
You'll give the speech
I tell you

41:32.032 --> 41:34.701
and do exactly as you are told,

41:34.701 --> 41:39.206
or the next package
will be his head.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.845
She's made her choice, then.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.938
Dombey, a fucking Critch lover.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.522
I never thought I'd see the day.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.690
He's got a son.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.943
He's got a responsibility
to the lad's future.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.903
Well, that's what I said.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.363
He said he's setting an example.

42:11.363 --> 42:12.781
Of what,

42:12.781 --> 42:15.450
how to piss your self-respect
up the wall?

42:15.450 --> 42:17.452
- That's right.
- Seriously.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.788
- What's happening
with people, eh?
- He's right.

42:19.788 --> 42:22.457
We let these talking animals
start swanning around

42:22.457 --> 42:24.459
like they're as good
as the rest of us.

42:24.459 --> 42:27.254
Well, we can't
fucking have that, can we?!

42:27.254 --> 42:28.922
We just can't!

42:28.922 --> 42:30.799
End of everything, that'll be!

42:30.799 --> 42:33.426
It won't come to that.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.345
Dombey's already gone off
the deep end,

42:35.345 --> 42:38.181
but the rest of us know
how things are meant to be.

42:39.849 --> 42:41.768
And how we make 'em
stay that way!

43:15.135 --> 43:17.137
Sorted your love life out, then?

43:18.179 --> 43:19.431
Bitch.

43:19.431 --> 43:21.141
Cow.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.478
Here.

43:28.982 --> 43:31.109
I'll fly in and flush 'em out.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.610
What?

43:32.610 --> 43:34.946
No need.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.948
But they're still inside.

43:36.948 --> 43:38.658
That's the point.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.869
Is that a problem?

43:46.207 --> 43:49.461
Kaine,
I'm not a murderer.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.638
Fucking cunts!

44:21.201 --> 44:22.285
Fuck!

44:22.285 --> 44:24.454
Sh... What the fuck
is going on?!

44:29.876 --> 44:32.879
Fuck!

44:37.759 --> 44:40.762
Mosley!

44:41.846 --> 44:44.849
Mosley!

44:48.019 --> 44:49.437
The fuck?

44:52.023 --> 44:53.233
Motherfucker!

45:00.198 --> 45:01.157
Aah!

45:01.157 --> 45:02.575
Fuck!

45:03.493 --> 45:04.661
Fuck.

45:04.661 --> 45:07.038
Vini, help us!

45:09.249 --> 45:10.083
Vini!

45:58.673 --> 46:00.925
You're fucking joking.

46:02.177 --> 46:03.511
I need his help.

46:03.511 --> 46:05.221
Nice to see you, too, mate.

46:27.243 --> 46:29.245
It's just like old times.

46:53.102 --> 46:55.730
Right.

46:55.730 --> 46:57.232
Ready when you are.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.193
We're ready.

47:18.586 --> 47:23.758
<i>Morr Faélar isteag mit.</i>

47:30.515 --> 47:35.478
<i>Morr Faélar isteag mit.</i>

47:43.695 --> 47:45.238
Ambassador. Welcome.

47:45.238 --> 47:47.240
Mr. Millworthy, thank you.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.951
Gentlemen, if you'd like
to follow me?

47:56.583 --> 47:58.001
Major Vir?

48:00.003 --> 48:02.005
Major Vir?

48:06.843 --> 48:09.053
Major Vir?

48:19.564 --> 48:21.399
What did you see?
