00:15.577 --> 00:19.084
September 1943,
after four years of war,

00:19.119 --> 00:21.482
the entirety of Europe is now
under German domination.

00:21.814 --> 00:25.255
However, with Allied victories
in Stalingrad and El Alamein,

00:25.290 --> 00:27.587
the tide of the war
seems to be turning.

00:28.722 --> 00:30.326
But it will never
turn in full until

00:30.361 --> 00:31.756
the Allied invasion of Europe.

00:32.297 --> 00:34.429
With the French coast
still an impenetrable fortress,

00:34.464 --> 00:37.630
the best way in is the enemy's
soft underbelly, Italy.

00:38.369 --> 00:40.171
Fortunately, the landing
in Sicily means British

00:40.206 --> 00:42.206
and American forces are
now lapping at the heels

00:42.241 --> 00:43.669
of the Axis war machine.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.078
Thus, Operation Avalanche
is born.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.806
On September 9th, 1943,
the Allies will attempt to land

00:48.841 --> 00:50.676
in the back door
of the Nazi empire

00:50.711 --> 00:52.447
along the coast of
Italy at Salerno.

00:53.285 --> 00:55.318
To punch a hole in the door
means first clearing

00:55.353 --> 00:57.782
the enemy waters of the deadly
U-Boats and coastal guns.

00:57.817 --> 01:00.389
For that, the Navy will
rely on its smallest

01:00.424 --> 01:03.095
and swiftest vessel,
patrol torpedo boat,

01:03.130 --> 01:04.723
also known as the PT.

01:05.726 --> 01:08.100
While the Allied fleet moves
across the Tyrrhenian Sea,

01:08.135 --> 01:10.234
the only defense for
the PTs are a single ship

01:10.269 --> 01:11.697
of the Merchant Marines.

01:12.337 --> 01:15.701
Comprised of civilian and Navy
personnel U.S. Merchant Marine

01:15.736 --> 01:18.242
fights for the supply and
the men of the U.S. Armed Forces

01:18.277 --> 01:19.837
with all the resources
they'll need.

01:20.543 --> 01:22.609
Tonight the fight,
no less important than

01:22.644 --> 01:24.380
the liberation of
the free world,

01:24.415 --> 01:26.613
will rest in the hands
of that lone vessel,

01:26.648 --> 01:29.220
the S.S. Lawton B. Evans
and her brave crew aboard.

01:29.717 --> 01:32.223
This is our story.

01:49.770 --> 01:52.342
That's that German barge
Irish warned us about.

01:52.773 --> 01:54.542
We got bigger guns.
Should we go in?

01:54.577 --> 01:56.841
Not our job, Buck.
It's a Liberty ship.

01:56.876 --> 01:58.810
We can deliver 10 tons
of K-ration,

01:58.845 --> 02:00.713
lumber and cotton
blankets to Palermo.

02:00.748 --> 02:03.122
Let the warships
take care of the war.

02:04.389 --> 02:05.784
General quarters.

02:05.819 --> 02:07.357
General quarters.

02:08.492 --> 02:09.821
-Let's go!
-[piping]

02:12.397 --> 02:14.793
[alarm blares]

02:40.821 --> 02:42.458
F-Lighter on target.

02:43.857 --> 02:45.593
F-Lighter on target!

02:45.628 --> 02:47.298
We're on target, on target.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.203
Looks like he's going
to fire the torpedoes.

02:51.766 --> 02:53.568
Those F-Lighters are tough,

02:53.603 --> 02:55.966
but nothing a couple of fish
can't take down real fast.

02:56.001 --> 02:59.442
Okay, man,
prepare the torpedoes.

03:05.615 --> 03:07.450
Starboard torpedo!

03:07.881 --> 03:08.913
Fire!

03:10.620 --> 03:12.884
Portside torpedo!

03:12.919 --> 03:14.424
Fire!

03:15.823 --> 03:17.724
Come on.

03:25.701 --> 03:27.701
Yes!

03:27.736 --> 03:29.802
There she goes.

03:29.837 --> 03:31.606
Direct hit!
Direct hit!

03:31.641 --> 03:33.410
Good work, men.

03:33.445 --> 03:35.214
Direct hit, direct hit.

03:35.612 --> 03:37.480
Got him!
Took about time!

03:37.515 --> 03:38.679
Did you see that, Tommy?

03:38.714 --> 03:40.945
I saw it.
Beautiful, beautiful!

03:41.618 --> 03:42.749
Couldn't have done
better myself.

03:48.328 --> 03:49.987
Four marks.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.362
They got eyes on us!

03:52.629 --> 03:54.233
Shit.

04:00.736 --> 04:01.966
It's a coastal battery!

04:02.837 --> 04:05.244
Get the hell outta here!
Flank speed ahead!

04:05.576 --> 04:06.740
Flank speed ahead!

04:06.775 --> 04:08.478
Hard right rudder, 10 degrees!

04:08.513 --> 04:09.578
Hard right rudder, 10 degrees!

04:09.613 --> 04:10.942
Avoid fire!

04:13.782 --> 04:14.880
[phone ringing]

04:18.589 --> 04:19.918
Redeker!
Redeker!

04:20.657 --> 04:23.262
-Full speed ahead!
-Full speed ahead!

04:24.760 --> 04:26.463
[shouting]

04:26.498 --> 04:27.992
[gunfire, explosions]

04:32.504 --> 04:35.307
All hands to battle stations!
All hands to battle stations!

04:35.342 --> 04:37.507
All under fire!
We are under fire!

04:37.542 --> 04:39.773
We're gonna lose that PT
if we don't do something now.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.973
Get ready!
Get loaded!

04:42.008 --> 04:43.579
-I need to be--
-Load up! Load up!

04:43.614 --> 04:44.844
They're sitting ducks
out there, Skip!

04:44.879 --> 04:45.711
Collective fire to the shore!

04:45.747 --> 04:47.748
Repeat, collective fire
to the shore!

04:47.783 --> 04:49.387
Repeat, collective fire
to the shore!

04:49.422 --> 04:51.290
Fire on land!
On land!

04:59.894 --> 05:02.433
Flank speed ahead!
Flank speed ahead!

05:08.441 --> 05:10.738
Skip, that was the last
of our escorts.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.646
Damn it!

05:17.681 --> 05:19.351
We gotta take out those guns!

05:19.386 --> 05:20.583
It's no use, Skip.

05:21.852 --> 05:23.652
I didn't start this fight, but
I'm damn well gonna finish it.

05:23.951 --> 05:26.853
Rapid continual fire
at shoreline now!

05:27.119 --> 05:28.822
Rapid continual fire
on shoreline!

05:28.857 --> 05:31.121
Repeat, rapid continuous fire
to the shoreline!

05:31.156 --> 05:33.497
Let's kick their asses!
Come on! Come on!

05:33.532 --> 05:34.696
[gunfire]

05:35.732 --> 05:37.028
100 degrees to port!

05:37.063 --> 05:38.568
[shouting]

05:40.473 --> 05:41.538
Lined up.

05:41.573 --> 05:43.100
Fire!

05:53.684 --> 05:54.947
Reload! Reload!

06:04.464 --> 06:05.892
[gunfire]

06:10.096 --> 06:11.370
[explosions]

06:12.505 --> 06:14.098
Recover! Reload!

06:14.133 --> 06:15.935
Recover, recover,
reload, reload!

06:18.478 --> 06:19.642
[shouting]

06:23.780 --> 06:24.944
Agh!

06:24.979 --> 06:26.616
Go check the boilers
for damage!

06:29.654 --> 06:30.653
How is it?

06:31.887 --> 06:33.920
Can't take another one
of those, Skipper.

06:34.923 --> 06:36.560
Charlie, go around
for another pass.

06:36.595 --> 06:38.826
-Hard left rudder.
-Hard left rudder.

06:38.861 --> 06:42.434
This is not a destroyer, Bill.
We've gotta turn around!

06:48.541 --> 06:50.068
Get us the hell
outta here, helmsman.

06:50.807 --> 06:52.411
Aye, aye, sir.

07:34.719 --> 07:35.817
Let's pick it up, boys!

07:36.083 --> 07:37.786
Wanna finish this detail
before Christmas!

07:37.821 --> 07:39.216
I don't see you helping.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.152
Ah, you're working like
you play chess, Moose.

07:41.187 --> 07:42.219
Let's pick it up.

07:44.861 --> 07:46.993
Think we're taking this baby
all the way to Berlin?

07:47.897 --> 07:50.128
That's not how
depth charges work, Bauer.

07:52.099 --> 07:53.505
All right, ladies.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.474
You got five minutes,
let's pick it up!

08:07.147 --> 08:08.751
Couple of dents
that could use hammering.

08:09.215 --> 08:11.281
Otherwise, she held up okay.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.821
This isn't what I had in mind.

08:12.856 --> 08:14.658
Redeker, I didn't sign up
to get shot at.

08:14.693 --> 08:15.890
Krauts ruin everything.

08:15.925 --> 08:17.793
This isn't the Navy!
We're Merchant Marines!

08:17.828 --> 08:19.795
Well, you'd think the Germans
would grant us a deferment.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.764
All those guardboys topside?

08:22.162 --> 08:24.195
They're the ones trained
for this nonsense!

08:24.230 --> 08:25.834
I'm just here to keep
this baby afloat.

08:25.869 --> 08:28.133
Look, it's all
a matter of luck.

08:28.773 --> 08:31.004
When was the last time you were
back home in Mill Valley?

08:31.303 --> 08:33.710
Let's see. 1941?

08:33.745 --> 08:35.239
Oh, I've been home since then.

08:35.274 --> 08:37.945
And I'll tell you,
you wouldn't like it.

08:37.980 --> 08:39.749
You liar.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.850
You got the prettiest little
family I've ever seen.

08:41.885 --> 08:45.656
That's what I'm saying!
I am fabulously lucky!

08:45.691 --> 08:48.252
You, on the other hand,
not so much.

08:49.992 --> 08:52.025
Look, it's like poker.

08:52.060 --> 08:55.864
Out here, you're a respected
sailor with a full house.

08:55.899 --> 08:58.966
Back home, you maybe
got a pair of sixes.

08:59.001 --> 09:02.805
At sea, you ain't never
getting these aces, kid.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.578
Are you trying
to make me feel better?

09:07.372 --> 09:08.778
Not really.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.077
Mission accomplished, chief.

09:11.112 --> 09:13.145
Hey, I'm always here for you.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.554
I'm like the ship therapist.

09:15.952 --> 09:17.556
I'm gonna start
charging you guys.

09:22.156 --> 09:23.320
[explosions]

09:23.355 --> 09:25.597
I heard things got a
little hairy out there.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.764
How's things on Lawton B. Evans?

09:27.799 --> 09:31.097
Our last escort was destroyed
and we barely escaped alive.

09:31.132 --> 09:32.901
But the ship took
the brunt of it.

09:32.936 --> 09:34.364
We're leaking oil like a sieve

09:34.399 --> 09:36.740
and we'll be vulnerable
until we can repair it.

09:36.775 --> 09:37.807
Sounds like it was hell.

09:37.842 --> 09:39.842
I misjudged the situation, sir.

09:39.877 --> 09:41.076
Oh, bullshit!

09:41.112 --> 09:43.978
The Jerrys have that entire
coastline armed to the teeth.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.342
They been
interrupting our movements

09:45.377 --> 09:46.717
in that sector for weeks.

09:47.115 --> 09:48.246
It's only a matter of time

09:48.281 --> 09:49.885
'til you came upon
a coastal battery.

09:50.855 --> 09:53.284
Now listen, Snow,
I know you had a bit of bad luck

09:53.319 --> 09:54.384
back in Tunisia, but...

09:54.419 --> 09:55.858
I wasn't cut out
for convoys, sir.

09:55.893 --> 09:56.892
I was trained to fight.

09:56.928 --> 09:59.092
Yeah, well, those
fighting instincts of yours

09:59.127 --> 10:00.830
almost cost a thousand men
their lives.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.866
I take full responsibility
for my actions, sir.

10:03.901 --> 10:05.296
I alone am to blame.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.265
That's why I'm gonna give
you a shot at redemption.

10:08.103 --> 10:09.102
Sir?

10:10.271 --> 10:12.677
Landing troops on Salerno Beach
in less than 48 hours.

10:13.273 --> 10:14.646
The invasion of Europe?

10:14.681 --> 10:15.944
Commander?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.652
This is Major General Bradley.

10:20.687 --> 10:21.851
General?

10:22.282 --> 10:23.886
Listen. We're looking
to stick it to Hitler

10:23.921 --> 10:25.283
by taking out
his buddy, Mussolini.

10:25.318 --> 10:26.284
That sound good to you?

10:27.760 --> 10:28.893
Great, sir!

10:28.928 --> 10:31.696
Great. You might have noticed
the coast around Salerno

10:31.731 --> 10:34.259
is heavily armed with
a battery of SS88s,

10:34.294 --> 10:35.425
the toughest gun in their army.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.635
Yes, sir.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.396
We're sending in
two PT boats with commandos

10:39.431 --> 10:41.937
to take out those guns.

10:41.972 --> 10:43.103
We're gonna need your men
to provide

10:43.138 --> 10:44.742
artillery support as needed.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.140
The Lawton B. Evans, General?

10:47.175 --> 10:48.207
That's right.

10:49.410 --> 10:51.716
The Krauts are looking to get
a foothold back in Italy.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.015
Fact is, your little cargo ship

10:54.050 --> 10:56.919
is the most powerful vessel
that we have in that sector.

10:56.954 --> 10:58.756
I won't let you down, General.

11:00.023 --> 11:01.319
You're damn right, you won't.

11:02.157 --> 11:04.091
This is gonna be the single
most important mission

11:04.126 --> 11:06.995
that you and your men on the
S.S. Evans have ever conducted.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.294
Thousands of lives
depend on it.

11:09.329 --> 11:10.328
Understood, sir!

11:10.803 --> 11:12.297
You got 36 hours to get
in there

11:12.332 --> 11:14.673
and knock out all the
enemy vessels before daybreak

11:15.038 --> 11:17.203
or the invasion of Salerno
will be in jeopardy.

11:17.238 --> 11:18.303
Understood?

11:18.338 --> 11:19.744
Yes, sir!

11:20.945 --> 11:22.076
Commander?

11:24.311 --> 11:29.149
Listen, Lieutenant, I know this
is a dangerous mission, but...

11:29.184 --> 11:30.887
I am honored to be chosen
for this duty, sir.

11:30.922 --> 11:33.450
All I can think about
is getting back in the fight.

11:35.091 --> 11:37.454
Well, I guess we wouldn't
want it any other way, would we?

11:38.160 --> 11:39.225
Barnes out.

11:40.096 --> 11:41.865
0600, we're outta here.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.066
Italy.

11:57.014 --> 11:58.244
Hey, hey.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.214
All right, all right, all right.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.721
Chorizo.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.121
Orozco, could we have
some eggs with Spam?

12:07.156 --> 12:09.354
Mr. Ford!
I been looking for you!

12:09.389 --> 12:11.092
Yeah, what do you got?

12:11.127 --> 12:13.259
Well, you know how
we were out of bacon.

12:13.294 --> 12:14.392
You got bacon.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.394
I got something
better than bacon.

12:16.429 --> 12:17.802
I got chorizo.

12:18.332 --> 12:19.364
Never heard of it.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.432
You'll love it.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.467
I don't care about protein.
You know what I want.

12:24.107 --> 12:26.239
Yeah, I know what you want.

12:27.407 --> 12:29.374
I knew you'd come through!

12:30.047 --> 12:31.376
What do I owe you?

12:31.411 --> 12:33.950
Hey, just your friendship,
homes...

12:34.282 --> 12:36.249
Oh, and $10.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.251
Deal.

12:38.286 --> 12:40.121
Hey, Orozco.

12:40.156 --> 12:41.485
When you gonna shave
that moustache?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.421
When Hitler shaves his.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.832
[whistles]

12:47.867 --> 12:49.394
Hey! Come get your eggs!

12:51.299 --> 12:52.364
Come on, Moosie.

12:52.971 --> 12:55.136
Before Snider
does some more sit-ups?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.175
Uh...

13:08.349 --> 13:09.414
Would y'all quit it?

13:09.449 --> 13:11.020
You're giving me
performance anxiety.

13:11.055 --> 13:12.923
[laughing]

13:17.193 --> 13:18.456
Are you sure you wanna do that?

13:20.592 --> 13:21.899
Yeah, why not?

13:21.934 --> 13:23.065
Because.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.001
Go ahead.

13:25.036 --> 13:26.068
What?

13:26.103 --> 13:27.234
Nothing.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.137
Just tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

13:29.172 --> 13:30.468
Hey, you're gonna do it anyway.

13:30.503 --> 13:32.140
No, I'm not.
You're doing great.

13:32.175 --> 13:33.174
Don't listen to me.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.814
-You sure?
-Promise.

13:42.449 --> 13:44.383
You know, the funny thing
about chess is

13:44.418 --> 13:47.386
if you do the best move too
early, it's a wasted move.

13:47.421 --> 13:48.926
That's right.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.895
You gotta save the piece
with the most potential,

13:50.930 --> 13:53.326
which in this case, is the queen

13:54.428 --> 13:56.197
until you've exhausted
all the other options.

14:07.243 --> 14:08.946
Come on, Moose.
This year.

14:19.387 --> 14:20.551
Aw!

14:22.258 --> 14:23.488
For crying out loud.

14:23.523 --> 14:24.422
You know what?
Put a shirt on!

14:24.458 --> 14:26.293
You're already making
me feel like crap!

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
I gotta stop betting
on you, Moose.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.869
Be the butt of
the prank.

14:43.378 --> 14:46.181
Come on, fishy, fishy.
Come on.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.219
Bauer!

14:51.254 --> 14:53.892
You think you're gonna catch a
German U-boat with this thing?

14:54.554 --> 14:55.894
It'd make quite a trophy.

14:56.259 --> 14:58.292
Ensign!
I got Barnes calling for you!

14:59.031 --> 15:00.030
Yeah, it would.

15:11.109 --> 15:12.141
Commander?

15:12.176 --> 15:13.439
Ensign Ford?

15:13.705 --> 15:15.177
Yes, sir?

15:16.411 --> 15:20.578
I have a very important
and rather unique request.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.954
I'd very much appreciate it
that you'd keep it

15:22.989 --> 15:23.955
between the two of us.

15:25.519 --> 15:26.584
Of course, sir.

15:27.787 --> 15:30.687
I want you to keep an eye on
our friend, Lieutenant Snow.

15:33.593 --> 15:35.659
I don't understand, Commander.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.597
I know Snow is a great fighter.

15:40.270 --> 15:41.698
I've known that ever
since he and I met

15:41.733 --> 15:43.942
on the battlefield
back in Tunisia.

15:44.604 --> 15:45.735
Toughest in the Navy, sir.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.638
But this is not
the Navy, Ensign,

15:47.673 --> 15:49.079
this is the Merchant Marine.

15:49.609 --> 15:51.411
You've got a fine capable crew.

15:52.216 --> 15:54.315
But you and I both know
that those boys have

15:54.350 --> 15:57.153
neither the discipline
or the training

15:57.188 --> 15:59.089
to go against those
Germans on their own.

16:00.191 --> 16:02.257
And that's just the fight
that he's looking for, sir.

16:02.292 --> 16:04.655
Which is exactly why
I need you to make sure

16:04.690 --> 16:06.756
that he does not jump
out of his frigging boots

16:06.791 --> 16:08.329
at the first smell of combat.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.661
I'd rather not
challenge the lieutenant

16:10.696 --> 16:12.069
in front of the men, sir.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.071
I'm not asking you
to challenge him.

16:15.338 --> 16:16.700
Just be straight with him, Ford.

16:16.735 --> 16:18.240
He'll listen to you.

16:18.737 --> 16:21.243
If there's any problem,
I've got your back on this.

16:23.247 --> 16:24.246
Understood.
Thank you, sir.

16:25.349 --> 16:27.546
And you'll be off the shore
of Salerno in 34 hours.

16:27.581 --> 16:30.648
That gives you 12 hours until
the invasion fleet arrives.

16:31.387 --> 16:33.387
We cannot allow any
diversions to get in the way

16:33.422 --> 16:34.751
of landing on Italy.

16:35.457 --> 16:37.028
Are we clear on this?

16:37.393 --> 16:39.096
Understood.
I will do my best, sir.

16:39.362 --> 16:40.625
That's all I ask.

16:44.268 --> 16:45.333
Ensign out, sir.

16:58.513 --> 16:59.545
Skip?

17:00.845 --> 17:02.317
Irish says by tomorrow,

17:02.352 --> 17:04.220
visibility should
be close to nil.

17:04.255 --> 17:05.287
I heard.

17:06.587 --> 17:08.092
Well, you think that's
gonna interfere with us

17:08.127 --> 17:09.225
taking out those 88s?

17:10.428 --> 17:13.097
They're not gonna call the
invasion just 'cause it's foggy.

17:15.299 --> 17:17.134
Fancy a snort?

17:17.565 --> 17:19.532
Only if you can figure out
a way to get this bucket

17:19.567 --> 17:22.403
to the Italian coast
without it falling apart.

17:22.735 --> 17:24.636
You know we're at the goddamn
mercy of this war, Bill.

17:24.671 --> 17:26.770
Spare me.

17:27.311 --> 17:28.805
You've seen the battle maps.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.609
All of us are just pins
on a piece of paper

17:30.644 --> 17:31.877
the admirals stick in there.

17:31.912 --> 17:34.151
At the end of the day, both of
us are just trying to survive.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.351
And not be that pin
thrown in the trash.

17:37.783 --> 17:40.586
I lost my buddy
because I failed to do my job.

17:42.590 --> 17:45.327
Doug died because he was picked
off by a German U-boat.

17:45.725 --> 17:49.265
I abandoned my convoy
chasing shadows, pal.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.533
You saw a chance.

17:50.568 --> 17:52.829
You had an opportunity to take
out a pack of German U-boats.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.106
If I were in your position,
I'd have done the same thing.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.637
Excuse me, Mr. Snow?

17:58.672 --> 17:59.770
Yeah?

17:59.805 --> 18:01.574
I got a reading a mile east.

18:02.214 --> 18:03.213
What do you figure?

18:03.479 --> 18:05.479
It's pretty big.
Could be a U-boat.

18:06.383 --> 18:07.382
Thanks, Irish.

18:08.651 --> 18:11.353
If we steer clear north a couple
of miles, we should avoid it.

18:12.455 --> 18:13.619
Let's bag it.

18:15.326 --> 18:17.161
Jesus, Bill!
It's a U-boat!

18:17.196 --> 18:18.426
We should steer clear.

18:18.461 --> 18:19.727
This is my command, damn it.

18:19.763 --> 18:22.562
If we can catch that sub on the
surface, we can take her out.

18:22.597 --> 18:23.761
I say let's do it.

18:25.567 --> 18:26.599
Yes, sir.

18:27.835 --> 18:30.240
Tell the men to man the guns
and prepare the depth charges.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.110
The moon's not gonna rise
for a couple of hours.

18:33.509 --> 18:35.245
The bastards
will never see us coming.

18:36.479 --> 18:38.116
Aye aye, Skip.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.223
General quarters.
General quarters.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.785
All men, man your
battle stations.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.556
General quarters,
General quarters.

18:49.591 --> 18:51.492
All men, man your
battle stations.

18:52.264 --> 18:54.462
General quarters,
General quarters.

18:54.497 --> 18:56.200
All men, man your
battle stations.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.828
General quarters,
General quarters.

18:57.863 --> 18:59.731
All men, man
your battle stations!

18:59.766 --> 19:01.502
General quarters, guys.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.176
General quarters.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.305
How's she looking, Irish?

19:36.275 --> 19:37.571
I think we got the drop
on him, Lieutenant.

19:37.837 --> 19:40.673
Should be 2:00, 800 yards out.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.675
Say it!
He shoulda won MVP, is all!

19:42.710 --> 19:45.381
Well, he didn't, so you know!
Who cares?

19:45.416 --> 19:46.448
Does that matter?

19:47.684 --> 19:49.451
Do you always blindly accept
the judgment of your betters?

19:49.486 --> 19:51.519
That, and the Yankees
won the World Series

19:51.554 --> 19:53.851
while the Red Sox finished what?
20 games back?

19:53.886 --> 19:55.688
And that's Ted Williams' fault?

19:55.723 --> 19:58.493
It's called MVP,
Most Valuable Player.

19:58.528 --> 20:00.693
How valuable can Ted Williams
be if the Red Sox

20:00.728 --> 20:01.892
can't win the Pennant?

20:01.927 --> 20:03.729
I'm disgusted, my friend,

20:03.764 --> 20:05.995
that you could be so cavalier
when it comes to the injustice

20:06.030 --> 20:07.502
delivered by the hands of
the Baseball Writers'

20:07.537 --> 20:08.899
Association of America!

20:08.934 --> 20:10.439
I think Robert Feller
should have won.

20:10.474 --> 20:11.506
What?

20:11.541 --> 20:12.573
He had more strikeouts.

20:12.608 --> 20:14.311
Feller? You're an idiot!

20:14.610 --> 20:16.346
Don't you have work to do?

20:16.381 --> 20:17.743
Come on!
I'm not even half-cocked.

20:17.778 --> 20:18.810
Let's get loaded!

20:18.845 --> 20:20.317
-Reload, Jeffries!!
-Loading!

20:23.817 --> 20:25.619
I confirm that U-boat. 2:00.

20:35.565 --> 20:36.894
Shall we blast him
with a five-inch?

20:36.929 --> 20:39.897
Not yet.
I want to get a little closer.

20:40.438 --> 20:42.306
Is that really necessary?

20:42.341 --> 20:43.835
If you want
a confirmed hit, it is.

20:47.379 --> 20:48.906
I wanna sink that bastard.

20:50.448 --> 20:51.909
Yeah, but the closer
we get to them,

20:51.944 --> 20:53.383
the better chance the Germans
gonna see us

20:53.418 --> 20:55.385
and those U-boats have 88mm.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.617
And I've had a taste of 'em

20:56.652 --> 20:58.322
and I'm not really up
for another one!

20:58.357 --> 20:59.785
Or we can miss and
end up with nothing.

21:00.656 --> 21:02.689
We've got the best gunners
in the Mediterranean.

21:02.724 --> 21:04.493
They can hit an ice cream truck
from this distance!

21:04.528 --> 21:05.725
If you don't like it,
get your own command.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.792
We're goin' in.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.926
-Take her slow ahead.
-Swell.

21:08.961 --> 21:09.993
Aye, aye.
Slow ahead.

21:32.017 --> 21:33.720
300 yards, Skipper.

21:33.755 --> 21:35.887
I need 12 degrees to starboard!

21:35.922 --> 21:37.691
12 degrees to starboard!

21:38.397 --> 21:39.429
200 yards, Skipper!

21:41.532 --> 21:42.729
Five-inch, lock and load.

21:43.831 --> 21:44.995
Five-inch, lock and load!

21:51.707 --> 21:53.938
Grovener, I'm lined up
and I'm ready to kill it!

21:55.414 --> 21:56.743
Snow, we're locked and loaded!

21:56.778 --> 21:57.942
On target!

21:58.582 --> 21:59.647
Fire when ready.

21:59.682 --> 22:02.650
Five-inch fire!
Repeat, five-inch fire!

22:02.685 --> 22:05.587
-Fire at will!
-Fire!

22:13.729 --> 22:14.992
[gunfire]

22:17.997 --> 22:19.370
[shouts]

22:23.970 --> 22:25.673
Take cover!

22:26.478 --> 22:27.972
Hard right rudder,
full throttle!

22:28.007 --> 22:29.875
Hard right
rudder, full throttle!

22:29.910 --> 22:31.074
Give 'em hell, boys!

22:31.109 --> 22:32.614
[phone rings]

22:36.081 --> 22:37.850
Hard right rudder,
full throttle!

22:37.885 --> 22:39.489
Hard right
rudder, full throttle!

22:41.119 --> 22:42.591
[gunfire]

22:51.503 --> 22:52.667
Where'd it go?

22:52.702 --> 22:53.734
I don't see it!

22:53.769 --> 22:54.966
You see it, Grovener?

22:55.001 --> 22:56.869
No, not from me!
What about you, Jeffries?

22:56.904 --> 22:58.970
-Nothing over here!
-Who's got the binoculars?

22:59.005 --> 23:00.037
Eyes on the horizon!

23:07.211 --> 23:08.518
He's out of sight.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.651
Yeah, give me those.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.391
He is not getting away.

23:18.123 --> 23:19.793
Prepare depth charges starboard.

23:20.796 --> 23:23.060
Aye, aye. Prepare depth
charges, starboard!

23:23.601 --> 23:25.667
-Depth charge, Jeffries!
-On it!

23:26.131 --> 23:28.164
Get the lead out, Jeffries!
Come on!

23:28.936 --> 23:31.541
-Release depth charges!
-Release depth charges!

23:51.662 --> 23:52.661
Ah!

23:53.224 --> 23:54.960
Any sign of that sub?

23:55.567 --> 23:56.566
Not on the surface, Skip.

23:57.932 --> 23:59.503
Another 200 yards should do it.

24:00.066 --> 24:01.230
We need to disengage.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.770
Not a chance!

24:03.575 --> 24:04.574
Without the element of surprise,

24:05.810 --> 24:07.038
a Liberty ship is not gonna
do any good against a U-boat!

24:08.007 --> 24:10.107
We've got more guns,
we've got bigger guns.

24:10.142 --> 24:11.141
Simple.

24:11.177 --> 24:13.583
It's not gonna matter if
we can't see the enemy!

24:13.618 --> 24:17.015
Do I need to remind you who's
commanding this ship, Ensign?

24:17.050 --> 24:18.082
No, sir.

24:19.888 --> 24:20.887
Dead slow ahead.

24:21.527 --> 24:22.988
Aye, aye, dead slow ahead!

24:23.859 --> 24:25.562
Slow ahead!

24:25.597 --> 24:26.959
Aye, aye.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.733
Where is it?

24:33.132 --> 24:34.703
Anyone got eyes on it?

24:35.002 --> 24:36.034
No, sir.

24:36.069 --> 24:37.706
Come on, baby, come on.

24:43.208 --> 24:45.109
Hell, that sub
could be anywhere.

24:45.683 --> 24:46.749
He's beneath us.

24:46.784 --> 24:49.883
U-boats can't go faster
than three knots submerged.

24:50.688 --> 24:51.885
If we can't knock him out,

24:52.591 --> 24:54.217
at least you can give
him a wakeup call.

24:54.890 --> 24:56.758
Drop depth charges!

24:56.793 --> 24:57.990
Depth charges portside.

24:58.025 --> 24:59.893
Depth charges portside!

24:59.928 --> 25:02.060
Repeat!
Depth charges portside!

25:19.244 --> 25:21.519
Torpedo! Torpedo!

25:21.818 --> 25:23.653
Torpedo! Portside!

25:23.688 --> 25:24.984
[explosion]

25:28.792 --> 25:30.660
Let's get some distance!

25:30.695 --> 25:32.596
Flank speed, 10 degrees right!

25:32.631 --> 25:34.664
Aye, aye, flank speed,
10 degrees right!

25:38.065 --> 25:39.867
Hard left!
We're turning around.

25:39.902 --> 25:41.066
Aye, aye!
Hard left!

25:45.776 --> 25:46.808
There! There he is!

25:46.843 --> 25:47.809
I see him!

25:52.343 --> 25:55.245
Hey, Skip! I got two Krauts
about to man that deck gun!

25:55.280 --> 25:57.247
Take 'em out! Do you want me
to hold your hand?

25:57.887 --> 25:58.886
Yes, sir!

26:00.285 --> 26:01.418
[gunfire]

26:05.356 --> 26:07.323
We've got maybe 30 seconds
before they unload those guns.

26:08.293 --> 26:10.293
Get closer.
Await orders.

26:10.966 --> 26:11.965
But sir...

26:13.738 --> 26:15.331
[speaking German]

26:16.840 --> 26:18.136
Incoming!

26:18.171 --> 26:20.611
[shouting]

26:21.680 --> 26:22.679
Incoming!

26:27.246 --> 26:29.752
What'd I say about
those deck guns, Bauer?

26:29.787 --> 26:31.050
I'm getting my bearings.

26:31.085 --> 26:32.722
Get your bearings faster!

26:32.988 --> 26:33.987
[gunfire]

26:39.126 --> 26:41.093
Oh, Christ!
Jeffries is shot!

26:43.130 --> 26:44.261
Come on, buddy!

26:44.296 --> 26:46.098
We got you, kid!
It's gonna be all right!

26:46.397 --> 26:48.837
Come on, now you better breathe!
You ain't got permission to die!

26:48.872 --> 26:50.168
Come on, come on, come on.

26:50.841 --> 26:52.973
-No, no, no, no, no.
-No!

26:55.010 --> 26:56.845
That's it.
That does it!

26:57.375 --> 26:59.144
Who wants to sink
a Kraut submarine?

26:59.179 --> 27:00.717
I never thought you'd ask.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.620
This ends right here and now!

27:05.317 --> 27:07.119
Collective fire, continuous!

27:07.154 --> 27:09.352
Collective fire, continuous!
Repeat!

27:09.387 --> 27:11.728
Collective fire
at will continuous!

27:11.763 --> 27:14.027
-On the right, on the right!
-All right!

27:18.165 --> 27:19.901
[screams]

27:19.936 --> 27:21.969
I'm lined up and
I'm ready to kill 'em!

27:22.004 --> 27:24.037
-Fire at will!
-Prepare to fire!

27:24.072 --> 27:25.643
Firing!

27:33.785 --> 27:35.114
Firing!

27:41.056 --> 27:42.319
I got him!

27:42.827 --> 27:44.761
Target down!
Target down!

27:44.796 --> 27:46.664
-Woo!
-Yeah!

27:47.227 --> 27:48.666
Good work, Bauer.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.362
Yeah, we did it!
We got 'em!

27:52.397 --> 27:54.034
Yeah!

27:54.465 --> 27:56.069
We did it!

27:56.104 --> 27:58.071
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

28:06.818 --> 28:08.345
Looks like Bauer
got his U-boat after all.

28:09.051 --> 28:10.380
Good work, men.
Great work!

28:10.415 --> 28:11.821
Skip?

28:11.856 --> 28:13.020
What is it?

28:14.353 --> 28:15.418
Jeffries is dead.

28:18.324 --> 28:19.829
Damn it.

28:36.078 --> 28:38.243
Donald Jeffries
didn't sign up for this.

28:38.278 --> 28:39.816
None of you men did.

28:40.313 --> 28:42.478
A merchant ship
is built to move supplies,

28:42.513 --> 28:45.822
not to go head to head with
enemy U-boats and destroyers.

28:46.253 --> 28:48.858
But that's what we've
been assigned to do.

28:49.256 --> 28:51.454
No, Jeffries didn't volunteer
for this kind of work.

28:51.489 --> 28:54.127
But when called to duty,
he performed valiantly.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.767
He did what he had to
when he had to do it

28:56.802 --> 28:58.494
without concern
for his own safety.

28:59.332 --> 29:01.299
He wanted nothing more than
to get off this bucket

29:01.334 --> 29:03.873
so he could head home and
take over the family farm.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.271
But he didn't get that chance.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.273
He's not gonna get
to go home because he got

29:08.308 --> 29:12.783
killed doing his job,
his job as an American.

29:13.478 --> 29:15.412
The best we can do going
forward is

29:15.447 --> 29:17.414
to respect his sacrifice
by doing our job

29:17.449 --> 29:19.317
so we can all
get outta this mess

29:19.352 --> 29:21.891
and get back to our families
where we belong.

29:29.164 --> 29:30.768
[radio static]

29:31.298 --> 29:32.231
Commander Barnes?

29:34.499 --> 29:37.038
I understand that
you ran into some action.

29:37.469 --> 29:38.502
Yes, sir.

29:38.537 --> 29:40.338
We lost a man in a fire
fight with a U-boat, sir.

29:40.373 --> 29:42.208
Jesus.

29:42.243 --> 29:44.980
This is exactly what
I did not want to happen.

29:45.312 --> 29:46.511
It couldn't be avoided,
Commander.

29:46.547 --> 29:48.984
Are you telling me there was
nowhere else in the entire ocean

29:49.019 --> 29:51.888
for you to go except head
to head with a German U-boat?

29:52.187 --> 29:53.516
It was us or them, sir.

29:53.551 --> 29:56.024
Lieutenant Snow saw
an opportunity and he took it.

29:56.059 --> 29:57.861
There was no opportunity!

29:58.226 --> 30:00.831
You have a mission!
This is Snow being Snow!

30:01.196 --> 30:03.031
I know you're going to need
his fighting spirit

30:03.066 --> 30:07.200
when you reached that coast,
but not one damn minute before.

30:07.598 --> 30:11.941
Now I want you to tell me,
between the two of us,

30:12.339 --> 30:14.812
can you keep
Lieutenant Snow on course?

30:16.079 --> 30:17.408
I will do
everything short of mutiny

30:17.443 --> 30:19.344
to keep the lieutenant
on target, sir.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.051
But, sir...

30:23.086 --> 30:24.085
But what, Ensign?

30:24.483 --> 30:26.120
We're sitting ducks out here.

30:26.155 --> 30:28.485
And we both know the men
are not combat-ready.

30:29.224 --> 30:30.927
They got a lot of heart, but--

30:30.962 --> 30:32.357
What are you driving at, Ford?

30:33.360 --> 30:37.065
Is there really no help in
the area for us, Commander?

30:37.496 --> 30:40.497
Every damn vessel is accounted
for and you know that.

30:42.501 --> 30:45.271
Any escort would be
much appreciated, sir.

30:45.537 --> 30:48.241
You do your part and make
sure Snow clears that beach

30:48.276 --> 30:50.507
and I'll see if I can
find someone to divert.

30:52.346 --> 30:53.411
Thank you, sir.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.060
[knocking]

31:05.095 --> 31:06.324
Come in!

31:10.397 --> 31:12.133
Those were some nice words
you said out there.

31:13.301 --> 31:15.103
Well, the kid was 19 years old.

31:15.534 --> 31:18.238
How do you sum up a man's life
when he never got to live one?

31:20.011 --> 31:22.011
We wouldn't be burying him
if you didn't take on that sub.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.278
What's that supposed to mean?

31:26.578 --> 31:29.018
We're burying a man at
sea because you're acting

31:29.053 --> 31:30.283
like you have
something to prove.

31:32.023 --> 31:34.287
We had a chance
to sink a U-boat.

31:34.322 --> 31:36.322
I'm not gonna back down
from that responsibility.

31:36.357 --> 31:37.620
That's my job.

31:38.359 --> 31:40.029
Not on this mission.

31:40.460 --> 31:41.626
With all due respect, sir,

31:41.661 --> 31:44.363
your recklessness has caused
a young man to lose his life

31:44.398 --> 31:47.003
when we should be on our way
to Italy to clear that coast out

31:47.038 --> 31:49.566
for our boys invading
so they don't get cut to shreds

31:49.601 --> 31:52.140
by the most dangerous
gun the Germans have!

31:52.175 --> 31:55.275
A PT boat was lost
and an entire crew killed

31:55.310 --> 31:57.310
because I didn't have
the guts to take action!

31:58.214 --> 31:59.675
I'm not gonna make
that mistake again.

32:01.184 --> 32:03.184
They were killed because
of your recklessness.

32:03.219 --> 32:06.583
Jeffries was killed because
you didn't listen to your crew.

32:09.588 --> 32:10.587
We're in a war.

32:11.690 --> 32:13.359
You told me yourself
you cannot choose your battle.

32:13.394 --> 32:14.360
You said that.

32:15.429 --> 32:17.231
Well, I was mistaken.

32:17.266 --> 32:19.596
Sometimes you can make a choice.
And you made the wrong choice.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.665
It could happen
to any one of us.

32:22.700 --> 32:26.273
So just stop worrying
about your guts!

32:26.308 --> 32:28.176
You are the toughest man I know!

32:31.082 --> 32:32.213
Are you finished?

32:34.613 --> 32:36.415
I make no promises.

32:36.450 --> 32:39.286
Sir, I have General Bradley
on the radio.

32:39.321 --> 32:40.485
-Bradley?
-Bradley?

32:41.752 --> 32:43.488
Don't let that go to your head!

32:45.228 --> 32:46.491
[gunfire]

32:48.726 --> 32:50.693
Lieutenant, good news!

32:50.728 --> 32:52.134
The Italians are out of the war.

32:52.169 --> 32:53.234
Italy surrendered?

32:53.269 --> 32:54.301
That's right.

32:54.336 --> 32:56.237
Ike announced it 10 minutes ago.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.471
We always knew the Italians
were paper tigers.

33:00.243 --> 33:01.979
They quit the minute
we took Sicily,

33:02.245 --> 33:05.378
which means those 88s are gonna
be manned by crack Nazi troops.

33:06.183 --> 33:08.282
And they never faced
U.S. Navy, sir.

33:08.317 --> 33:09.712
It's gonna be
one hell of a fight.

33:09.747 --> 33:11.648
But I'm counting on you
to take that beach.

33:12.321 --> 33:13.991
I got the best crew
in the U.S. Navy.

33:14.257 --> 33:15.355
So I've heard.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.654
Commander, anything
you'd like to add?

33:19.130 --> 33:21.592
Well, Snow, you can expect
the Germans

33:21.627 --> 33:23.792
to take over naval
operations as well.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.135
Nazis don't miss a beat,
do they, sir?

33:26.170 --> 33:27.697
No, they do not.

33:27.732 --> 33:30.172
You're gonna be faced with
German destroyers and F-Lighters

33:30.207 --> 33:31.503
up and down that coast.

33:32.770 --> 33:34.275
These boys don't play nice.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.542
Neither do we, sir.
Neither do we.

33:45.585 --> 33:47.486
[jazz music plays]

33:47.521 --> 33:49.158
Come on. Act like you
wanna win some money.

33:49.787 --> 33:51.424
He doesn't wanna win.
He's gonna lose.

33:52.361 --> 33:54.064
Give it right here.
Put it on the table.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.033
Hey, how about not
cheating this time?

33:56.563 --> 33:58.200
Yeah, I heard about you.

33:58.235 --> 33:59.564
You know exactly
what you're doing.

33:59.599 --> 34:01.302
Yeah, you're the guy
with three aces.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.205
I don't know why
you're dealing.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.569
-He had six aces at once.
-Yeah.

34:05.803 --> 34:06.669
I'll tell you what, boys.

34:06.704 --> 34:08.309
With all this money
I'm about to win,

34:08.344 --> 34:10.278
I'm gonna get a tattoo of
my girl.

34:10.313 --> 34:11.642
Oh, yeah!

34:11.677 --> 34:12.808
Romeo!

34:12.843 --> 34:14.150
Hey, Bauer!

34:14.581 --> 34:16.152
Your meatloaf special!

34:16.418 --> 34:17.450
Grovener, you got that?

34:17.485 --> 34:18.583
-Yeah, I got it.
-Thanks, pal.

34:18.618 --> 34:20.123
You gotta try this.

34:20.158 --> 34:21.454
This is the best meatloaf
in the world.

34:23.425 --> 34:26.327
Well, I don't know what my mom
would do if I got a tattoo.

34:27.198 --> 34:28.593
You know what?

34:29.134 --> 34:30.859
Every one you get
will desensitize her.

34:30.894 --> 34:32.135
I know mine did.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.732
You're gonna love Cookie's
special meatloaf.

34:36.438 --> 34:37.470
Best meal of the month.

34:37.505 --> 34:38.702
Oh, yeah.

34:38.737 --> 34:40.242
I could eat a bear.

34:40.574 --> 34:42.772
Hey, Cookie, you want
in on this game or what?

34:42.807 --> 34:44.246
I need someone with some balls

34:44.281 --> 34:45.775
and isn't afraid
to lose some money.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.513
-Ooh!
-Hey!

34:47.548 --> 34:48.679
I gotta get back to the kitchen

34:48.714 --> 34:51.121
and make another
special meatloaf.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.488
Take a little bite.

34:57.294 --> 34:59.393
Yeah, yeah, the whole thing.

34:59.428 --> 35:00.889
That's real good, huh?

35:00.924 --> 35:02.363
What you think about that?

35:02.860 --> 35:04.629
-You like it?
-It's real tasty, isn't it?

35:05.500 --> 35:06.763
What's wrong?

35:09.471 --> 35:11.207
That's not hot.
Keep going.

35:12.474 --> 35:13.737
Owie, that's hot!

35:13.772 --> 35:15.145
-Oh, yeah?
-It's real hot!

35:15.180 --> 35:17.279
Give me some water!
Give me the water!

35:17.314 --> 35:18.577
[laughing]

35:22.484 --> 35:23.846
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

35:23.881 --> 35:24.980
What the hell, Cookie?

35:25.016 --> 35:26.915
Want to make the meal a little
less spicy next time?

35:26.950 --> 35:28.752
[laughing]

35:28.787 --> 35:30.853
Hey, that's the way we do
it in Texas, okay?

35:30.888 --> 35:32.360
Put a little hair on your nuts!

35:36.663 --> 35:38.201
Hey, where you going?

35:42.273 --> 35:46.572
So getting a hit in 56 straight
games isn't a big deal?

35:46.607 --> 35:49.179
It's a huge deal,
but it's trivia.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.346
Come on, when somebody puts
milk bottles on their heads

35:51.381 --> 35:52.875
and balances 'em,
it's impressive.

35:52.910 --> 35:54.613
But it don't mean
they should be president!

35:54.648 --> 35:57.550
That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard.

35:57.585 --> 35:58.684
Milk bottles?

35:58.720 --> 36:01.455
DiMaggio is the greatest
centerfielder of all times.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.754
But did he bat .400?

36:04.955 --> 36:06.559
I hear the Braves
are doing good this year.

36:07.628 --> 36:09.562
That's just... what?

36:10.400 --> 36:12.367
I'm beginning to think you don't
know what you're talking about.

36:12.831 --> 36:13.962
Get this guy outta here.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.370
Yeah, get out of here.

36:15.405 --> 36:16.866
You're not here,
you're not here.

36:18.540 --> 36:19.539
Who wants to finish this?

36:20.675 --> 36:21.970
Yeah, I'll take a bite. Leave it
right here on the table.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.675
All right, let's go.

36:29.881 --> 36:32.321
Counterintelligence
is now reporting increased

36:32.356 --> 36:34.488
German naval activity
off Salerno.

36:35.458 --> 36:38.195
Looks like Hitler wants to hold
onto Italy as long as he can.

36:38.692 --> 36:39.758
Yeah.

36:39.793 --> 36:41.594
And air reconnaissance
just spotted what looks like

36:41.629 --> 36:44.960
an enemy destroyer opposite
the coastal artillery unit.

36:46.469 --> 36:48.634
I hope Snow
and his cowboys are ready.

36:48.669 --> 36:49.899
They'll be ready, sir.

36:51.771 --> 36:54.970
Think they can handle a Kraut
destroyer with five-inch guns?

36:55.005 --> 36:57.005
Snow's a salty
son of a bitch, sir.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.842
If anyone can, it's him.

37:00.285 --> 37:01.284
Better be right.

37:08.722 --> 37:11.261
Hey! A roof! Now that's
major home improvement!

37:11.296 --> 37:12.790
That's what I've been
trying to tell her.

37:12.825 --> 37:13.991
Yeah.

37:14.026 --> 37:16.233
Definitely something that
she shouldn't try on her own.

37:16.565 --> 37:17.798
It leaks a little.
I get it.

37:17.833 --> 37:20.468
But, you know, put a bucket down
or something until I get back.

37:20.503 --> 37:21.369
I don't wanna be ripped off

37:21.404 --> 37:23.405
because some jerk
knows I'm overseas.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.736
Hey, a guy could take advantage.

37:24.771 --> 37:26.034
Yeah, exactly.

37:26.069 --> 37:30.643
Single woman at home
by herself, helpless?

37:30.678 --> 37:32.876
Come on, it happens
all the time.

37:33.978 --> 37:35.912
Wait. What?
What do you mean?

37:35.947 --> 37:38.783
No. We're in love.
She wouldn't do that, right?

37:38.818 --> 37:40.620
She wouldn't do that.

37:40.655 --> 37:42.886
Irish to the bridge,
Irish to the bridge.

37:42.921 --> 37:43.953
You better go!

37:43.988 --> 37:45.526
Don't try to change the subject!

37:46.628 --> 37:47.957
I'm coming right back!

38:05.548 --> 38:07.284
Hey, you thinking about
swimming to Italy?

38:08.683 --> 38:11.684
I wasn't supposed to get into
another firefight again.

38:12.016 --> 38:15.787
That wasn't the plan,
but here we are, pal.

38:16.691 --> 38:20.297
Well, I been in one war
and that's one too many.

38:21.597 --> 38:24.334
I'd feel the same way if
I served on the Jacob Jones.

38:25.095 --> 38:28.635
Wow, I was so proud to
be manning a four-incher

38:28.670 --> 38:30.967
on a world-class destroyer.

38:32.608 --> 38:34.872
I was good, too.
Boy, I was real good.

38:34.907 --> 38:36.412
So I heard, Cookie.

38:37.008 --> 38:38.711
You know, after
we got torpedoed,

38:40.418 --> 38:42.979
the Jacob Jones
went down so fast,

38:43.916 --> 38:46.587
we didn't even send out
a distress call.

38:48.525 --> 38:49.821
60 men...

38:50.857 --> 38:52.725
60 men lost
in eight minutes.

38:54.993 --> 38:58.467
I swore I'd never be
on a combat ship again.

38:59.635 --> 39:02.702
Well, if it helps,
if it's any consolation at all,

39:02.737 --> 39:04.869
you are the best cook
in the U.S. Navy.

39:04.904 --> 39:06.673
Damn right.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.609
I take care of my men.

39:09.546 --> 39:11.139
If there's one thing
I've learned in this man's Navy

39:11.174 --> 39:13.350
is that everybody's got
their own part of the play.

39:13.781 --> 39:16.749
From the galley to the head
and all the assholes in between

39:17.048 --> 39:19.719
it takes all of us
to make a Navy ship,

39:20.557 --> 39:24.493
even a broken down Liberty ship
like the Lawton B. Evans.

39:25.595 --> 39:27.089
You know what? I'd better
get back to the kitchen.

39:27.124 --> 39:28.365
Okay.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.961
You know, why can't we have
any tequila on this boat?

39:31.469 --> 39:33.700
Because, we're in Europe.

39:33.735 --> 39:37.374
If we get over to Acapulco,
I will get you some tequila.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.641
Acapulco, here we come.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.453
Keep an eye out for any vessels

39:50.488 --> 39:52.015
that might try to
kill us in this mess.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.720
As always, Skip.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.426
Yeah, watch out for some
giant squid while you're at it.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.758
Definitely.
That's the last thing we need.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.465
Not too far from
the coast, are we?

40:02.731 --> 40:03.928
Just out of our radar.

40:04.766 --> 40:05.798
So about 30 miles?

40:09.771 --> 40:11.037
You know, you got
a hell of a crew here.

40:11.073 --> 40:15.610
Best in the Navy and that's not
just something I tell people.

40:31.694 --> 40:34.024
Whoa, whoa, you can't do that.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.024
Why not?

40:36.963 --> 40:38.831
It's not a move.
It's not a chess move.

40:39.834 --> 40:40.967
But it makes sense.

40:41.002 --> 40:43.165
That's where I want my piece
to go, so I put it there.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.804
Knights don't move like that.

40:44.839 --> 40:45.838
Why not?

40:45.874 --> 40:47.543
What do you mean, why not?
Those are the rules.

40:47.908 --> 40:48.940
But...

40:48.975 --> 40:50.007
Ah, jeez.

40:50.042 --> 40:51.107
Can a pawn do that?

40:51.142 --> 40:52.174
Yeah, of course.

40:52.209 --> 40:53.582
Well then, why not
the horse guy?

40:53.980 --> 40:55.650
We've been over this.

40:55.685 --> 40:58.455
The knights
do this L-shaped thing.

41:01.592 --> 41:02.888
Aren't knights more
valuable than pawns?

41:02.923 --> 41:03.988
Yeah.

41:04.023 --> 41:05.253
Then why can't
they move like pawns?

41:05.288 --> 41:06.760
I don't know. Just...

41:07.994 --> 41:10.467
Knights can't do the thing
you're trying to do.

41:11.063 --> 41:14.867
They only move in this L-shaped
way like we talked about.

41:20.809 --> 41:22.270
-Whoa, whoa...
-Is that better?

41:22.305 --> 41:23.876
-Yeah, that's...
-Whoa.

41:25.715 --> 41:26.945
Look at that.

41:27.585 --> 41:28.617
What?

41:28.652 --> 41:29.684
What's happening?

41:29.719 --> 41:30.718
Noth--nothing.

41:31.754 --> 41:33.754
-Did I just...
-Seriously?

41:33.789 --> 41:34.688
Did I win?

41:34.724 --> 41:36.790
-You better tell him.
-I won, didn't I?

41:36.825 --> 41:38.990
[cheering]

41:39.025 --> 41:40.189
Yeah!

41:42.259 --> 41:43.599
One for Minnesota!

41:43.634 --> 41:45.029
[shouting]

41:45.064 --> 41:46.932
General quarters!
General quarters!

41:46.967 --> 41:48.032
All men, man your
battle stations!

41:48.067 --> 41:49.671
-I win!
-It doesn't count.

41:49.706 --> 41:51.299
General quarters!
General quarters!

41:51.334 --> 41:53.169
All men, man your
battle stations!

41:53.776 --> 41:54.907
General quarters!

41:58.880 --> 42:01.749
Bauer, we got a destroyer
in the area. General quarters.

42:02.081 --> 42:03.553
If I catch one,
I'll let you know.

42:05.018 --> 42:06.787
Man your post, sailor!

42:09.660 --> 42:10.923
[chuckles]

42:15.193 --> 42:16.665
Get us lined up, Grovener.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.260
Get you lined up.
I'll get you lined up.

42:18.295 --> 42:20.163
-All right, all right.
-We're in line, we're in line.

42:26.204 --> 42:27.643
You sure it's that destroyer?

42:27.942 --> 42:30.041
I don't know, but it's big.

42:31.044 --> 42:32.549
Should we reverse course?

42:32.947 --> 42:33.980
Well, let's pause a while

42:34.015 --> 42:37.587
and see what that thing is
and where it's headed.

42:37.622 --> 42:39.215
Dead slow ahead.

42:39.250 --> 42:41.657
Aye, aye, sir.
Dead slow ahead.

42:58.973 --> 43:00.577
I don't see nothing.

43:03.681 --> 43:04.845
Bauer! General quarters!

43:05.848 --> 43:07.683
I know, but, sir...

43:07.718 --> 43:09.685
We're headlong into
a destroyer, sailor!

43:09.720 --> 43:11.016
Get the lead out!

43:11.051 --> 43:12.184
I got something, sir!

43:12.219 --> 43:13.953
I don't know what it is, but
it's gotta be pretty big!

43:13.988 --> 43:14.954
Well, why didn't you tell me?

43:14.989 --> 43:17.352
Here. Let me reel it in!
You go prep your gun!

43:17.387 --> 43:19.860
Thank you, sir. You have no idea
how much means to me!

43:19.895 --> 43:22.896
Yeah. My God, I'd hate you
to lose your fish.

43:22.931 --> 43:24.293
Thank you, sir.

43:24.328 --> 43:25.360
No!

43:25.395 --> 43:26.999
We're in a war, sailor!

43:27.034 --> 43:29.606
You go man that gun or
I throw you in the drink!

43:39.409 --> 43:40.275
Do you see it?

43:40.982 --> 43:43.312
-Oh, God bless it.
-I don't hear anything.

43:44.018 --> 43:45.083
Aw, man.

43:46.186 --> 43:48.185
I can't believe that
we're looking for a destroyer

43:48.220 --> 43:49.890
instead of delivering supplies.

43:50.222 --> 43:52.288
If only my old man
could see me now.

43:54.127 --> 43:55.390
I hear nothing.

43:55.425 --> 43:56.864
Do you?

43:56.899 --> 43:58.162
Not a damn thing!

44:09.780 --> 44:11.307
Do you see anything, Grovener?

44:11.342 --> 44:12.847
I don't see nothing, Tony.

44:13.718 --> 44:15.245
That's what scares me.

44:19.284 --> 44:20.987
I know we got
a destroyer out there.

44:21.022 --> 44:22.186
I just can't see it.

44:23.255 --> 44:25.728
What's standard operating
procedure for pea soup?

44:25.763 --> 44:29.127
What I'm doing, moving
as little as possible.

44:29.162 --> 44:30.667
Any update on that ship?

44:31.736 --> 44:34.165
It's close, sir, real close.

44:34.772 --> 44:38.235
Well, lucky for us, Kraut
radar's as bad as ours.

44:39.172 --> 44:41.139
Also need to make sure
we don't drift too close

44:41.174 --> 44:43.141
to the shoreline in
range of those 88s.

44:43.946 --> 44:45.814
Back in Annapolis,
they don't tell you what to do

44:45.849 --> 44:47.442
if you can't see
or hear anything.

44:48.951 --> 44:50.819
That's why they pay you
the big bucks, sir.

44:51.822 --> 44:53.822
I expected more
than $150 a week.

44:57.223 --> 44:58.827
See anything?

44:58.862 --> 44:59.828
No.

45:13.338 --> 45:14.469
I got nothing!

45:20.510 --> 45:21.982
There's something on the radar.

45:22.952 --> 45:24.380
You guys hear that?

45:24.415 --> 45:25.381
Yeah, I still hear it.

45:27.385 --> 45:28.418
It's getting closer.

45:29.387 --> 45:31.354
Destroyer coming right at us!
30 degrees to port!

45:31.389 --> 45:32.828
30 degrees to port!

45:36.834 --> 45:37.998
It's coming right towards us.

45:38.396 --> 45:40.836
-Hard right rudder!
-Hard right rudder!

45:51.376 --> 45:52.881
Prepare depth charges!

45:52.916 --> 45:54.014
Full to starboard.

45:54.049 --> 45:55.752
Fire at will,
fire at will.

45:56.084 --> 45:57.215
Full to starboard.

45:57.250 --> 45:59.415
Depth charge starboard, now!

45:59.450 --> 46:01.087
Depth charge starboard, now!

46:01.122 --> 46:02.759
[gunfire]

46:06.358 --> 46:07.896
-Fire! Fire!
-Light 'em up, boys.

46:07.931 --> 46:09.392
Fire!
Come on!

46:13.167 --> 46:14.870
-Bringing fire.
-Firing!

46:20.438 --> 46:21.910
Did we get 'em?

46:29.051 --> 46:30.248
[gunfire]

46:32.186 --> 46:33.218
We got men on the shore!

46:33.253 --> 46:34.351
Krauts on the shore!

46:39.424 --> 46:40.995
We found those guns
you're looking for!

46:41.030 --> 46:42.128
They're gonna tear us to shreds!

46:42.163 --> 46:43.360
You think I don't know that?

46:45.562 --> 46:46.968
[shouting]

46:47.003 --> 46:48.838
-Take cover!
-Take cover! Take cover!

46:48.873 --> 46:51.335
We got shots coming
from shore battery!

46:53.174 --> 46:56.010
I want to see heavy fire
directed to that beach.

46:56.540 --> 46:58.342
Fire all guns!

47:06.616 --> 47:07.890
[shouts]

47:08.893 --> 47:10.387
Reload! Reload!

47:10.422 --> 47:12.356
[shouting]

47:12.391 --> 47:13.357
Firing!

47:16.197 --> 47:17.933
Oh, my foot!

47:19.497 --> 47:20.969
Move out!

47:21.004 --> 47:23.268
Oh, I got it in the foot.
Get off me! Get off me!

47:23.303 --> 47:24.335
Don't you have a job to do?

47:24.370 --> 47:26.370
Shut up, you moron!
I'm trying--

47:26.405 --> 47:28.174
Oh, my goddamned foot.

47:28.209 --> 47:29.373
It's just a nick,
it's just a nick.

47:29.408 --> 47:31.111
Oh, no, you remember Curry?

47:31.641 --> 47:33.982
He almost died when he shot
himself in the toe.

47:34.017 --> 47:35.049
I'm not gonna die.

47:35.084 --> 47:36.314
You don't know that!

47:36.349 --> 47:37.986
Come on, let's get
you below deck.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.251
Get you to see a medic.

47:40.221 --> 47:41.385
Get up, you big lug!

47:43.224 --> 47:45.059
Come on.

47:47.129 --> 47:48.260
[shouting]

47:50.264 --> 47:51.329
Sir, you gotta
watch that portal!

47:51.364 --> 47:52.396
You're gonna take a bullet!

47:53.168 --> 47:54.970
My time will come when it comes.

47:56.666 --> 47:58.402
They better be avoiding
those U-boats!

47:58.976 --> 48:00.008
They'd better!

48:14.321 --> 48:15.551
[explosion]

48:17.291 --> 48:19.962
That wasn't good.
It sounded like the engine room!

48:19.997 --> 48:21.425
[groans]

48:22.725 --> 48:24.901
Redeker? Are you okay?

48:25.266 --> 48:27.629
I'm all right!
Call top-side.

48:34.341 --> 48:36.110
Clevenger, were you hit?

48:36.442 --> 48:38.046
A shell tore through the side!

48:38.081 --> 48:41.049
Boiler one's down and boiler
two is losing pressure fast!

48:41.480 --> 48:42.952
Can you get 'em patched up?

48:42.987 --> 48:44.052
I can try.

48:45.288 --> 48:47.286
I can try and patch it, but
what about getting to Salerno?

48:48.091 --> 48:49.651
I'll send some men
to work the pumps.

48:52.425 --> 48:54.557
I'm fine!
It's fine!

48:54.592 --> 48:56.295
I'm fine, Tony!

48:56.330 --> 48:57.494
It's nothing, all right?

48:57.529 --> 48:58.693
Let's see how nothing it is.

48:58.728 --> 49:00.662
-Oh, that hurts!
-How does that feel?

49:00.697 --> 49:02.169
-It hurts!
-And there?

49:02.204 --> 49:03.665
It still hurts.

49:05.207 --> 49:07.339
Sounds like a ceasefire.
Maybe we're out of range.

49:07.704 --> 49:09.506
Oh, God! What,
are you trying to kill me?

49:09.541 --> 49:11.046
I'm not trying to kill you,
I'm just trying

49:11.081 --> 49:12.377
to make sure you're not dying!

49:12.412 --> 49:14.181
Listen, you can't say
nothing to no one.

49:14.216 --> 49:16.579
I don't wanna get sent back
to Sicily, I'm fine!

49:16.614 --> 49:18.449
Maybe I want you to
go back to Sicily!

49:18.484 --> 49:19.884
Maybe I'll shove
my boot up your ass!

49:19.919 --> 49:22.519
Wait a second!
You ain't even been shot,
you got shot in the boot!

49:22.554 --> 49:24.026
Well, it still hurts!

49:24.061 --> 49:25.357
Ah, it works because
you're a wuss!

49:25.392 --> 49:27.425
-Come on, get back in the fight!
-Here we go.

49:27.460 --> 49:29.196
Chief!
Chief!

49:29.231 --> 49:30.395
No, no.

49:30.430 --> 49:32.100
Hey, we got help coming.

49:32.366 --> 49:33.596
We got help coming,
so just hold on.

49:35.105 --> 49:36.764
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

49:36.799 --> 49:37.974
What are you talking about?

49:39.703 --> 49:40.735
Clev...

49:40.770 --> 49:42.341
No, I just gotta hold pressure.

49:42.376 --> 49:44.508
Would you just shut up,
all right?

49:45.247 --> 49:46.477
Clev, stop!

49:47.744 --> 49:48.985
Clev, stop.

49:52.089 --> 49:53.451
When you get back to San Fran,

49:54.784 --> 49:57.092
I want you to tell Em and
the girls that I love 'em.

50:02.132 --> 50:03.725
And that I'll see 'em
on the other side.

50:04.662 --> 50:05.661
I will, buddy.

50:06.796 --> 50:08.400
You do that for me.

50:08.435 --> 50:10.138
Yes. Okay.

50:11.174 --> 50:13.141
You're the best friend
I got, Clev.

50:17.774 --> 50:19.114
No!

50:19.149 --> 50:21.743
No, no, no, no,
please, please.

50:31.557 --> 50:33.392
The boys are stemming
the bleeding.

50:34.098 --> 50:35.394
We're powerless
for another hour.

50:35.429 --> 50:36.626
But we'll stay afloat
if we don't take

50:36.661 --> 50:37.792
another hit like that!

50:38.333 --> 50:39.399
What should we do?

50:39.434 --> 50:41.433
We'll never make it out
of here without full power.

50:46.308 --> 50:48.473
Maybe we don't have to.

50:49.311 --> 50:50.310
What?

50:50.708 --> 50:52.576
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

50:53.216 --> 50:54.644
Cease fire?
We'll be sitting ducks!

50:55.383 --> 50:57.713
Or maybe not! What if they think
they already sunk us?

50:59.189 --> 51:01.321
Have the boys throw everything
we don't need overboard,

51:01.356 --> 51:04.522
pots, pans, clothes, pinup girls
and a bunch of our cargo.

51:04.557 --> 51:06.557
I don't care what it is.
The tide's heading in.

51:06.856 --> 51:09.791
Everything we throw overboard
to make it look like we've sunk!

51:09.826 --> 51:11.166
Come on!
Get to work!

51:11.201 --> 51:13.201
Go, go, go, go, go!

51:14.600 --> 51:15.797
I don't care what it is!

51:15.832 --> 51:17.634
We got Krauts firing at
us from all sides.

51:17.669 --> 51:19.306
If it's not essential to
the war effort,

51:19.341 --> 51:21.308
I want it thrown into
the briny deep, you understand?

51:21.343 --> 51:23.277
What if it's
a nice piece of jewelry?

51:23.312 --> 51:25.477
-Toss it!
-Even if it's real small?

51:25.512 --> 51:27.479
No! Don't worry about it!

51:27.514 --> 51:29.316
Okay, so if it's
a big gold necklace,

51:29.351 --> 51:31.252
for example, we should
throw that in the ocean?

51:31.287 --> 51:32.550
Did you rob
a pirate ship, Bauer?

51:32.585 --> 51:33.683
Well, a small ring,
on the other hand--

51:33.718 --> 51:34.717
Shut the hell up, Bauer!

51:34.753 --> 51:38.094
I want all this stuff off
the boat in the ocean!

51:40.593 --> 51:42.428
So long, trash!

51:43.167 --> 51:44.529
You ever figure what happens
if we still

51:44.564 --> 51:46.102
get discovered by the Germans?

51:46.533 --> 51:47.499
It's the law of averages, Moose.

51:48.370 --> 51:50.172
Maybe they find this stuff,
maybe they won't.

51:50.207 --> 51:52.141
But are they supposed to?

51:52.176 --> 51:53.505
Ideally.

51:53.540 --> 51:55.771
See, I think about
the ancient Egyptians.

51:55.806 --> 51:57.773
They were always hiding things.

51:57.808 --> 51:59.148
And they couldn't
have known whether

51:59.183 --> 52:00.479
we'd find them or we wouldn't.

52:00.514 --> 52:02.316
What's your point?

52:02.351 --> 52:03.647
Oh, nothing.

52:03.682 --> 52:05.715
Just wondering if everything
isn't pointless.

52:06.553 --> 52:07.783
Wow!

52:07.818 --> 52:08.916
We're on a junk detail

52:08.951 --> 52:10.621
and you're getting
existential on me?

52:10.656 --> 52:12.623
[artillery fire]

52:13.758 --> 52:14.790
Scheisse!

52:15.925 --> 52:17.133
Let's get outta here!

52:24.241 --> 52:25.339
Are we battened down?

52:25.374 --> 52:26.670
If they can't fire it
or wear it, sir,

52:26.705 --> 52:27.704
it's headed towards shore.

52:27.740 --> 52:30.146
Let's hope that satisfies
our German friends.

52:43.821 --> 52:46.558
Just unwarranted
is all I'm saying.

52:46.593 --> 52:47.889
Uh-huh.

52:47.924 --> 52:49.297
All right, hand me the Philips.

52:50.300 --> 52:51.299
That fishing pole,

52:51.829 --> 52:54.830
it survived Casablanca,
Algiers,

52:54.865 --> 52:57.800
Tunisia, Messina...

52:58.440 --> 52:59.901
Did you catch anything?

52:59.936 --> 53:01.408
What?

53:01.443 --> 53:02.904
You ever actually
catch anything?

53:05.315 --> 53:06.578
So what if I didn't?

53:07.284 --> 53:09.614
Then the pole itself
doesn't matter much, does it?

53:09.649 --> 53:11.682
I mean, you might
as well have used a baguette.

53:11.981 --> 53:14.289
It's the principle, Irish.

53:14.720 --> 53:17.193
That fishing pole was not
his to throw in the ocean.

53:17.459 --> 53:20.196
Well, he's an officer,
so it kind of is.

53:22.728 --> 53:24.596
[radio static]

53:25.896 --> 53:27.335
Oh, will you listen to that?

53:27.370 --> 53:28.699
Oh, I'm a genius!

53:29.900 --> 53:31.438
Woo!

53:31.473 --> 53:32.868
For the boys working the pumps,

53:32.903 --> 53:35.475
we got maybe 40 minutes
at 10% power.

53:35.972 --> 53:37.005
Make it last.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.743
We have less than 24 hours
until the fleet arrives.

53:40.350 --> 53:41.349
We'll try, sir.

53:53.957 --> 53:55.429
No sign of the enemy.

53:57.367 --> 53:59.301
I gotta hand it to you, sir.

53:59.864 --> 54:00.896
I thought we were goners.

54:02.065 --> 54:03.998
That idea of yours got us out
of one heck of a pickle.

54:05.001 --> 54:06.935
Well, we're not out
of the woods yet.

54:06.970 --> 54:09.641
Captain, I have
an update on the engine.

54:09.676 --> 54:11.478
All right, give it
to me straight, Doc.

54:12.041 --> 54:14.041
Clev says we can't do better
than a quarter power

54:14.076 --> 54:15.515
until we get more parts.

54:16.078 --> 54:17.517
What about fuel?

54:17.552 --> 54:19.948
Do we have what we need
to get back to Sicily?

54:19.983 --> 54:22.654
Probably have enough to get
halfway to Palermo.

54:26.396 --> 54:28.924
Gather the men.
We need to have a talk.

54:33.634 --> 54:35.469
That was quite a melee.

54:35.504 --> 54:37.933
The Krauts hit us
with everything they had

54:37.968 --> 54:40.276
and you boys
performed brilliantly.

54:41.345 --> 54:42.311
Yeah!

54:44.810 --> 54:46.645
You know, I've been eager
to get back to Salerno

54:46.680 --> 54:47.713
to take out those guns.

54:47.748 --> 54:50.451
But the engine room bore
the brunt of the fighting,

54:50.486 --> 54:52.948
and our ship ain't much
without her engines.

54:54.787 --> 54:56.721
Now the boys down below
have done one hell of a job.

54:56.756 --> 55:01.528
But the truth is,
we're down 75%.

55:01.827 --> 55:03.365
And we only have
enough fuel to get us

55:03.400 --> 55:04.894
about halfway back to base.

55:06.931 --> 55:10.999
The way I see it, there's no
choice but to abort the mission.

55:11.034 --> 55:13.474
[clamoring]

55:13.509 --> 55:15.971
Hey, lock it down, sailors!

55:19.581 --> 55:21.911
If we try to reach shore
under these conditions,

55:21.946 --> 55:23.847
there is no going back.

55:23.882 --> 55:29.358
I mean, once we're onshore,
we own it or we lose it.

55:30.493 --> 55:31.525
There's no middle ground.

55:34.057 --> 55:36.431
And if we're lucky enough
to survive until morning...

55:36.466 --> 55:39.401
and I say if, there's no
guarantee we'll have enough fuel

55:39.436 --> 55:42.338
to escape whatever fighters or
destroyers they send after us.

55:42.604 --> 55:43.636
Are you with me?

55:43.671 --> 55:44.901
What difference does it make

55:44.936 --> 55:46.540
if we can't make
it back to Palermo?

55:46.575 --> 55:48.410
We have enough fuel to
steer clear of the beach.

55:48.445 --> 55:49.708
We'll radio for a tender.

55:50.139 --> 55:51.743
I'm not crazy about it.

55:51.778 --> 55:53.613
Yeah, I didn't get shot just
so I could go back

55:53.648 --> 55:55.846
to Sicily without
seeing Salerno.

55:56.145 --> 55:58.783
Trying to reach the beach
without enough fuel

55:59.489 --> 56:01.016
is a suicide mission.

56:01.755 --> 56:02.820
I always wanted to go to Italy.

56:02.855 --> 56:03.986
I hear it's lovely.

56:06.463 --> 56:08.463
I can't ask any
more of you fellas

56:08.960 --> 56:10.025
than you've already given.

56:11.228 --> 56:13.963
Skipper, I remember watching
that PT getting hit the way

56:13.998 --> 56:16.372
they did and I've been
sick about it ever since.

56:16.869 --> 56:18.440
Everything we done all night

56:18.475 --> 56:19.903
has been to get back
at the Germans.

56:20.510 --> 56:22.708
We're so close now, it'd be
a crime to have to head back.

56:22.743 --> 56:24.006
-Yes.
-It ain't just Moose.

56:24.041 --> 56:25.579
I've been feeling the same way.

56:26.549 --> 56:28.384
Skip, we have Commander Barnes
on the radio.

56:28.881 --> 56:30.111
Dismissed, men!

56:32.918 --> 56:34.115
-We can't just--
-This is too important to--

56:34.150 --> 56:35.589
Do you mind?

56:35.624 --> 56:36.953
Not everyone's a coward
like Marca here!

56:37.527 --> 56:39.692
You got some real nerve.
You know that?

56:39.727 --> 56:40.924
Well, you know what, Boston?
Just shut your mouth.

56:40.959 --> 56:41.991
Oh, come on, buddy boy!

56:42.026 --> 56:43.564
Oh, yeah,
what are you thinking?

56:43.599 --> 56:44.697
I'll make that pretty face
something else!

56:44.732 --> 56:46.468
Hey, hey, hey!

56:47.196 --> 56:48.536
[radio static]

56:53.642 --> 56:55.939
Lieutenant Snow,
we're calling off your mission.

56:57.547 --> 56:59.514
Commander Barnes!
Commander Barnes! Over!

57:04.147 --> 57:06.587
Commander Barnes.
Commander Barnes, over.

57:07.216 --> 57:08.424
Come on...

57:10.054 --> 57:11.526
Damn it! Hello?

57:11.957 --> 57:13.121
Bill, are you there?

57:13.893 --> 57:14.859
Commander Barnes?

57:15.961 --> 57:18.093
[static]

57:18.667 --> 57:19.831
Commander Barnes, over.

57:20.636 --> 57:21.602
Snow?

57:22.198 --> 57:23.439
Ford, fix this radio.

57:29.744 --> 57:30.977
Listen to me!

57:31.012 --> 57:34.879
If you can hear me, the two PTs
that were carrying commandos

57:34.914 --> 57:36.848
for the assault were damaged
by Nazi fighters

57:36.883 --> 57:37.782
and had to turn back.

57:38.555 --> 57:40.522
If you reach that beach,
you are going to be

57:40.557 --> 57:42.920
sitting ducks for those 88s.
Do you copy?

57:43.890 --> 57:47.595
Snow, you need to pull back!
Hello?

57:47.630 --> 57:48.662
Give me that!

57:48.697 --> 57:49.828
God...

57:50.964 --> 57:52.897
Snow, you need to get
the hell outta there, right now.

57:52.932 --> 57:53.931
You understand?

57:56.265 --> 57:57.869
Lieutenant, can you hear me?

58:00.709 --> 58:03.578
Lieutenant, you need
to pull back immediately!

58:04.614 --> 58:05.712
Do you read?

58:09.883 --> 58:12.818
He better not blow that.
You understand?

58:12.853 --> 58:15.051
There's 10,000 lives at risk.

58:15.086 --> 58:16.151
Yes, General.

58:16.186 --> 58:17.757
Keep trying.

58:18.628 --> 58:20.254
You better get
these goddamn coms working

58:20.289 --> 58:21.596
one way or the other.
You hear me?

58:21.631 --> 58:22.630
Yes, sir.

58:23.866 --> 58:26.766
Well, men, sounds like this
is the end of the line for us.

58:30.035 --> 58:31.265
You heard the man's orders.

58:32.004 --> 58:33.234
I didn't hear a thing.

58:35.579 --> 58:38.074
We had some kind of radio
malfunction, Mr. Snow.

58:38.648 --> 58:40.010
I didn't hear nothin',
did you, fellas?

58:40.045 --> 58:42.045
I didn't hear nothin'.
Irish?

58:42.883 --> 58:45.950
I tried to fix it, but
you know me, all thumbs.

58:45.985 --> 58:48.887
That last Luftwaffe attack must
have knocked out the radio.

58:48.922 --> 58:49.921
It's been dead ever since.

58:52.288 --> 58:53.760
Don't look at me.

58:53.795 --> 58:55.531
My hearing's shot from
all those depth charges.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.533
All right, men.

58:57.997 --> 58:59.062
Prepare for deployment.

59:00.934 --> 59:01.933
We're about to invade Italy.

59:02.298 --> 59:03.935
[laughing]

59:06.203 --> 59:07.741
Let's get outta here.

59:14.948 --> 59:18.147
Our mission, gentlemen, is to
take out two German 88mm guns

59:18.182 --> 59:22.789
and the location is right here.

59:23.759 --> 59:26.661
About 50 yards south
is another German encampment

59:26.696 --> 59:28.729
comprised of about 40 men.

59:28.764 --> 59:31.259
Then to the north of
that is an encampment

59:31.294 --> 59:33.701
much smaller between
five and 10 men.

59:34.066 --> 59:35.736
If we reveal our position,

59:36.068 --> 59:38.904
they have enough fire power
to blow us sky high.

59:38.939 --> 59:41.643
That's why we plan
to land here,

59:41.678 --> 59:43.271
keeping the Evans safe
from harm.

59:43.306 --> 59:47.341
Now from here, you'll work
your way down to the guns.

59:47.376 --> 59:49.618
Stealth is of the
utmost importance

59:49.653 --> 59:51.983
as you approach the encampment
north of the 88s.

59:52.986 --> 59:54.920
You'll need to take
out the first gun.

59:54.955 --> 59:57.021
Then what's most important

59:57.056 --> 1:00:00.255
is these men south of it
in this foxhole.

1:00:01.423 --> 1:00:05.667
After killing these men as
quietly and quickly as possible,

1:00:05.702 --> 1:00:08.197
you can then proceed
to destroy the last gun

1:00:08.232 --> 1:00:11.739
before returning to
the ship for cake and soda.

1:00:13.138 --> 1:00:14.676
Any questions?

1:00:14.711 --> 1:00:15.710
No, sir.

1:00:15.746 --> 1:00:17.778
I have to admit I'd say
that's the craziest plan

1:00:17.813 --> 1:00:19.241
I've ever heard.

1:00:21.311 --> 1:00:22.684
He's right.

1:00:24.116 --> 1:00:25.115
Let's go win a war.

1:00:35.424 --> 1:00:38.425
We want this short and sweet.
Got it?

1:00:38.460 --> 1:00:39.833
We're here to take out those 88s

1:00:39.868 --> 1:00:41.868
and we only got
45 minutes to do it!

1:00:42.772 --> 1:00:45.201
So we want as little interaction
with the enemy as possible.

1:00:45.236 --> 1:00:48.776
The last thing I wanna see is
an entire unit of Germans!

1:00:48.811 --> 1:00:49.876
Are you with me?

1:00:49.911 --> 1:00:51.372
-Ready and willing, sir!
-Good.

1:00:51.407 --> 1:00:53.176
Now here's some cold hard facts.

1:00:53.783 --> 1:00:56.212
If I hear sustained fire
coming from the beach,

1:00:56.819 --> 1:00:58.247
I have no choice
but to withdraw.

1:00:58.282 --> 1:00:59.281
Do you understand?

1:00:59.855 --> 1:01:00.721
You got it, sir!

1:01:00.756 --> 1:01:02.889
This girl can't withstand
one more hit

1:01:02.924 --> 1:01:05.056
and I can't risk
the rest of the fellas.

1:01:05.091 --> 1:01:07.223
Remember, you've got
thousands

1:01:07.258 --> 1:01:09.060
of American and British
troops on their way.

1:01:10.195 --> 1:01:13.295
So if you get in any trouble,
boys, fight like hell.

1:01:13.330 --> 1:01:14.835
Help's coming, all right?

1:01:14.870 --> 1:01:15.902
Aye, Skip!

1:01:15.937 --> 1:01:16.936
Let's go fight a war!

1:01:17.466 --> 1:01:18.699
-Hey, Marca?
-Sir?

1:01:18.734 --> 1:01:21.435
Brew a pot of coffee. We're
gonna need it when we get back.

1:01:21.470 --> 1:01:22.909
Yes, sir, with cream.

1:01:24.473 --> 1:01:25.681
Lower the boat!

1:01:37.222 --> 1:01:38.452
We're about ashore now.

1:01:52.105 --> 1:01:53.236
Are you sure they're
still asleep?

1:01:55.911 --> 1:01:57.471
They are, sailor.

1:01:58.243 --> 1:01:59.341
Better stay frosty.

1:02:04.513 --> 1:02:06.249
It's awfully quiet out there.

1:02:11.993 --> 1:02:14.092
All right, guys,
get ready to disembark.

1:02:14.523 --> 1:02:16.127
Keep your head down,
you stay low.

1:02:35.852 --> 1:02:37.313
Moose and Snider, you're gonna
take that north tower.

1:02:37.348 --> 1:02:38.479
You're going to take
the satchels.

1:02:38.514 --> 1:02:40.085
Bauer and I are
going to take the south.

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:41.922
We meet back here.
Keep your head down low.

1:02:41.957 --> 1:02:43.418
-Go!
-Aye, Skip.

1:02:49.426 --> 1:02:52.130
General, with our coms down
and knowing Lieutenant Snow,

1:02:52.165 --> 1:02:54.363
I have to assume he
and his crew are proceeding

1:02:54.398 --> 1:02:56.002
with the original plan.

1:02:56.334 --> 1:02:58.070
If the Lawton B. Evans
is detected,

1:02:58.105 --> 1:03:00.039
it could compromise
the entire mission.

1:03:00.074 --> 1:03:01.304
Not if we take out those guns.

1:03:02.879 --> 1:03:03.911
What are you talking about?

1:03:03.946 --> 1:03:05.145
With those 88s out of the way,

1:03:05.181 --> 1:03:07.849
you can still establish that
Salerno beachhead as planned.

1:03:07.884 --> 1:03:10.819
Barnes, I've gotta get
10,000 Allied forces

1:03:10.854 --> 1:03:13.547
onto this beachhead!
Do you understand that?

1:03:13.582 --> 1:03:15.153
-Yes, sir.
-Huh?

1:03:15.485 --> 1:03:17.419
And you think I wanna gamble
it with some cowboys

1:03:17.454 --> 1:03:19.289
in a cargo ship who think
they can pull off

1:03:19.324 --> 1:03:22.556
some commando raid against
an elite S.S. unit?

1:03:22.591 --> 1:03:23.865
Is that what you think?

1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:26.164
10,000 men at risk!

1:03:26.595 --> 1:03:28.133
You think
they can pull that off?

1:03:28.465 --> 1:03:29.464
Yes, sir.

1:03:32.876 --> 1:03:34.205
I'm calling off the invasion.

1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:35.470
General, please!

1:03:36.572 --> 1:03:38.209
You gotta trust me on this.

1:03:40.081 --> 1:03:41.410
Listen to me.

1:03:41.445 --> 1:03:43.478
Snow and I go way back.

1:03:43.513 --> 1:03:45.117
He is a hell of a skipper.

1:03:45.152 --> 1:03:47.284
And if these boys say
they can get it done,

1:03:47.319 --> 1:03:49.055
then, by God,
they'll get it done!

1:03:50.894 --> 1:03:52.355
We're not out of this, sir.

1:04:01.971 --> 1:04:03.333
Get me General Donahue.

1:04:06.976 --> 1:04:08.470
If Snow and his men
don't take those guns out,

1:04:08.505 --> 1:04:10.505
it's gonna be your ass.

1:04:11.244 --> 1:04:13.079
The Germans will never
know what hit 'em, sir.

1:05:11.535 --> 1:05:13.909
[urinating]

1:05:43.171 --> 1:05:44.940
[chuckling]

1:06:12.233 --> 1:06:13.595
Grenade.

1:06:33.452 --> 1:06:35.050
[gunfire]

1:06:39.128 --> 1:06:40.391
What's the plan, Skip?

1:06:40.426 --> 1:06:42.690
Prep your gun.
We're moving in.

1:06:42.725 --> 1:06:44.494
By the time we're in range
of those 88s,

1:06:44.529 --> 1:06:47.134
the dynamite will have blown
them to kingdom come.

1:06:47.829 --> 1:06:49.532
All men to general quarters!

1:06:49.831 --> 1:06:51.402
All men to
general quarters!

1:06:51.437 --> 1:06:53.503
Say again, all men
to general quarters!

1:06:53.538 --> 1:06:55.010
[piping]

1:07:37.450 --> 1:07:38.581
Is it set?

1:07:40.453 --> 1:07:41.485
Let's move! Let's move!

1:08:30.371 --> 1:08:31.436
[explosion]

1:08:32.405 --> 1:08:33.768
That ought to slow them
Germans down a little.

1:08:34.871 --> 1:08:36.771
Sir, it looks like they just
took out one of the 88s.

1:08:36.806 --> 1:08:38.509
Waiting for visual
confirmation on the second.

1:08:39.908 --> 1:08:40.774
You guys get yours set?

1:08:40.809 --> 1:08:42.348
Yeah.
It should have gone off by now.

1:08:42.713 --> 1:08:43.778
This ain't good.

1:08:44.747 --> 1:08:45.613
The fuse must have got wet.
I'm going back.

1:08:45.648 --> 1:08:47.254
-Stay here.
-No, Skip, it's too late!

1:08:47.289 --> 1:08:49.388
[gunfire, shouting]

1:08:50.457 --> 1:08:51.522
-I got ya, buddy.
-I'm hit!

1:08:51.557 --> 1:08:52.754
Come on!

1:08:56.826 --> 1:08:58.265
Got eyes, Bauer?

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:00.663
I got you.

1:09:02.634 --> 1:09:04.766
Sir, I got two Germans up
on the ridge, 12:00.

1:09:05.703 --> 1:09:07.868
Take one on the right.
I take the one on the left.

1:09:07.903 --> 1:09:08.902
On three.

1:09:09.410 --> 1:09:11.608
One, two, three!

1:09:16.318 --> 1:09:17.680
-I got him!
-Nice shot.

1:09:26.493 --> 1:09:28.163
Why is it so quiet?

1:09:29.826 --> 1:09:31.166
Maybe they've fallen back.

1:09:32.796 --> 1:09:33.828
Maybe we scared 'em off.

1:09:33.863 --> 1:09:35.363
[airplane engine approaching]

1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.176
Incoming Messerschmitts, sir!

1:09:41.574 --> 1:09:43.376
Man the 50mm, Irish.

1:09:43.411 --> 1:09:45.411
Me, sir?
I'm an engineer!

1:09:45.446 --> 1:09:47.281
Make those Nazis
pay the price for

1:09:47.316 --> 1:09:49.217
taking on the best damn
gunners in the U.S. Navy.

1:09:49.483 --> 1:09:51.186
Yes, sir!

1:09:52.519 --> 1:09:53.752
You guys hear that?

1:09:53.787 --> 1:09:56.950
You know how in "King Kong"
when all the dinosaurs run away

1:09:56.985 --> 1:09:58.919
because they hear
the giant ape coming?

1:09:58.954 --> 1:10:00.459
Yeah.

1:10:01.990 --> 1:10:03.858
Sounds like they got
their giant ape.

1:10:03.893 --> 1:10:04.991
Messerschmitts!

1:10:05.026 --> 1:10:06.432
Get down.

1:10:13.969 --> 1:10:15.342
It's coming back around!

1:10:15.806 --> 1:10:17.839
All right, boys,
might as well go out fighting.

1:10:17.874 --> 1:10:19.313
Got enough ammo?

1:10:19.348 --> 1:10:20.446
Enough for a couple minutes.

1:10:20.481 --> 1:10:21.975
It ain't gonna last that long.

1:10:22.516 --> 1:10:23.548
Ready?

1:10:24.419 --> 1:10:25.418
Now!

1:10:34.825 --> 1:10:36.495
Woo!

1:10:40.567 --> 1:10:41.929
Light 'em up, fellas!

1:10:41.964 --> 1:10:44.767
Leave no stone unturned
or Nazi unshot!

1:10:46.837 --> 1:10:49.508
[shouting, gunfire]

1:10:49.774 --> 1:10:50.839
Fire at will!

1:10:52.777 --> 1:10:55.613
Moose? I'm not gonna
lose anymore guys.

1:10:55.648 --> 1:10:56.944
Get Moose up!
Let's get outta here!

1:10:57.551 --> 1:10:58.682
Take him to the shore.

1:10:58.717 --> 1:11:00.013
-Come on.
-Come on, Buddy.

1:11:00.785 --> 1:11:03.390
Come on. Come on, come on.

1:11:04.492 --> 1:11:05.920
All right.

1:11:07.891 --> 1:11:09.891
Ready to get your ass beat
in another game of chess?

1:11:11.334 --> 1:11:13.532
Remind me who won...

1:11:14.634 --> 1:11:15.798
You two can't quit.

1:11:16.372 --> 1:11:18.504
Didn't count, last time.

1:11:18.869 --> 1:11:19.934
It's a rematch.

1:11:23.038 --> 1:11:25.346
Prepare for that high
elevation shot!

1:11:25.381 --> 1:11:26.677
You got it!
You got it!

1:11:26.712 --> 1:11:28.910
-Loaded?
-Loaded! Fire at will!

1:11:28.945 --> 1:11:30.417
Woo!

1:11:35.050 --> 1:11:37.292
Come on! We got Messerschmitts
coming in hot!

1:11:39.692 --> 1:11:41.692
Eat my shorts, Hitler!

1:11:43.696 --> 1:11:45.366
-Locked and loaded?
-Locked and loaded.

1:11:45.401 --> 1:11:46.400
Fire at will!

1:11:51.407 --> 1:11:52.703
That's what I'm talking about!

1:12:05.454 --> 1:12:07.751
Holy cow!
I got one!

1:12:07.786 --> 1:12:09.016
Did you see that?

1:12:09.051 --> 1:12:11.458
Paul, Jacob!
Get in there, help him.

1:12:11.493 --> 1:12:12.690
He's shot!
Watch his leg!

1:12:12.725 --> 1:12:14.857
General quarters!

1:12:14.892 --> 1:12:17.123
Lt. Snow, there's still
one 88 remaining!

1:12:17.158 --> 1:12:18.894
Irish, lend a hand portside!

1:12:18.929 --> 1:12:20.731
Let's go!

1:12:24.132 --> 1:12:25.340
Welcome back.

1:12:26.871 --> 1:12:28.442
Good job!
Let's go!

1:12:33.174 --> 1:12:34.877
Move! Move!
You're all right?

1:12:34.912 --> 1:12:35.944
I've been better.

1:12:35.979 --> 1:12:37.011
Come on, come on.

1:12:37.046 --> 1:12:38.452
-Drop that gun!
-Orozco!

1:12:38.487 --> 1:12:40.047
Are you ready to
get back in the fight?

1:12:40.082 --> 1:12:41.851
-Can I kill Nazis?
-I hope so!

1:12:41.886 --> 1:12:42.984
Where do I sign, sir?

1:12:43.019 --> 1:12:44.491
Man the 20mm!

1:12:44.526 --> 1:12:47.021
20mm?
I'm about to kill some of them!

1:12:52.666 --> 1:12:54.094
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1:12:57.165 --> 1:12:58.868
Give me something to shoot at!

1:12:58.903 --> 1:13:01.035
Skip says to lay down
fire at the coastline.

1:13:01.070 --> 1:13:02.905
There we are.

1:13:02.940 --> 1:13:04.511
[gunfire]

1:13:08.649 --> 1:13:10.418
[splattering]

1:13:10.453 --> 1:13:11.980
Man down!
Man down!

1:13:12.015 --> 1:13:13.652
Get the med kit.

1:13:23.059 --> 1:13:26.632
Get some ammo!
Reload! Reload! Reload!

1:13:26.667 --> 1:13:27.666
Let's go, let's move!

1:13:28.801 --> 1:13:30.801
Come on, come on, come on!

1:13:32.805 --> 1:13:33.936
All right!

1:13:38.206 --> 1:13:39.678
[groans]

1:13:39.713 --> 1:13:40.877
Messerschmitts coming
right for us!

1:13:40.912 --> 1:13:42.747
Take cover!

1:13:48.689 --> 1:13:50.150
That was too close for comfort.

1:13:50.185 --> 1:13:51.492
Get up, you goldbrick.

1:13:54.090 --> 1:13:55.562
Oh, Jesus.

1:13:57.764 --> 1:13:58.763
No, no, no, no, no.

1:14:03.231 --> 1:14:05.165
No!

1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:06.936
Get back in your
position, seaman!

1:14:06.971 --> 1:14:08.971
We have to take out
that last 88!

1:14:09.809 --> 1:14:10.973
I'm sorry, sir.

1:14:11.239 --> 1:14:14.042
My gunner trainer,
Grovener, he's dead.

1:14:14.077 --> 1:14:15.549
Can you please take
the point of position?

1:14:15.584 --> 1:14:16.913
Copy that, seaman.

1:14:21.117 --> 1:14:22.688
Time for some
revenge killing.

1:14:26.122 --> 1:14:27.825
I got you, sir.

1:14:30.995 --> 1:14:32.698
[shouting]

1:14:41.742 --> 1:14:42.873
All right!

1:14:42.908 --> 1:14:44.237
On my command...

1:14:44.877 --> 1:14:46.679
Time for that
revenge killing, sir!

1:14:48.111 --> 1:14:49.748
Five degrees starboard!

1:14:49.783 --> 1:14:51.717
Yes, sir!
Five degrees starboard!

1:14:53.622 --> 1:14:56.018
Let's kill those Nazi bastards.

1:14:56.053 --> 1:14:57.954
On target, sir.

1:14:57.989 --> 1:15:00.154
And... fire!

1:15:00.189 --> 1:15:01.155
Fire!

1:15:10.166 --> 1:15:11.836
Oh!

1:15:11.871 --> 1:15:12.936
Yes, yes!

1:15:12.971 --> 1:15:14.168
[shouting]

1:15:16.271 --> 1:15:17.270
We got 'em!

1:15:19.615 --> 1:15:21.274
Way to go, Cap, way to go!

1:15:21.914 --> 1:15:23.782
Oh, yeah!

1:15:24.279 --> 1:15:26.653
That was one in
a million, Captain!

1:15:27.623 --> 1:15:29.018
You happy now, asshole?

1:15:29.856 --> 1:15:31.053
Thank you so much, sir.

1:15:31.924 --> 1:15:33.055
Grovener would have loved that.

1:15:34.322 --> 1:15:35.794
Grovener.

1:15:47.071 --> 1:15:49.544
I guess we invaded Italy
after all, huh, buddy?

1:15:59.952 --> 1:16:01.017
Not bad for a cargo ship.

1:16:01.052 --> 1:16:02.887
You're a hell of a shot, Skip.

1:16:03.384 --> 1:16:05.692
The way we're listing,
we're not gonna last 20 minutes.

1:16:06.893 --> 1:16:09.322
Well then, let's make it count.

1:16:13.834 --> 1:16:15.295
[gunfire]

1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:18.936
Pleasure to serving
with you, Mr. Ford.

1:16:18.971 --> 1:16:20.036
Pleasure's all mine, sir.

1:16:27.980 --> 1:16:29.848
Messerschmitt coming in!

1:16:29.883 --> 1:16:31.113
[shouts]

1:16:33.854 --> 1:16:35.821
[shouts]

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:37.019
Nice shot, Irish.

1:16:37.055 --> 1:16:38.989
-Thank you, sir.
-You ought to be a gunner.

1:16:44.997 --> 1:16:47.030
[shouts]

1:16:47.065 --> 1:16:49.131
Flight coming in!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:16:50.871 --> 1:16:51.936
Ah!

1:16:51.971 --> 1:16:54.367
I got shot in the ass!

1:16:59.242 --> 1:17:00.307
Ah!

1:17:00.342 --> 1:17:02.980
Medic!
Bring some morphine!

1:17:03.015 --> 1:17:05.081
Medic! Medic...

1:17:05.116 --> 1:17:06.313
I got you.

1:17:06.348 --> 1:17:07.820
-Morphine.
-Stay calm, stay calm.

1:17:07.855 --> 1:17:09.085
I'm always calm!

1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:10.350
I'll put pressure
on the wound.

1:17:10.385 --> 1:17:12.022
Hey, hey!
Get your hand off my ass!

1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:14.255
Stay calm, Cookie.
I just gotta stop the bleeding.

1:17:14.290 --> 1:17:15.762
All right.

1:17:15.797 --> 1:17:17.027
Tell me the truth.

1:17:17.062 --> 1:17:18.193
Am I ever gonna shit again?

1:17:18.228 --> 1:17:19.392
Not with this butt.

1:17:19.427 --> 1:17:23.770
Oh, I had such
a pretty butt too.

1:17:23.805 --> 1:17:25.332
Looks like hamburger now.

1:17:26.005 --> 1:17:28.709
Chorizo!
Say chorizo, cabrón.

1:17:28.744 --> 1:17:29.875
Okay, chorizo.

1:17:31.175 --> 1:17:32.680
It hurts!

1:17:38.281 --> 1:17:39.379
Coming back!

1:17:39.414 --> 1:17:41.183
Good luck!

1:17:46.157 --> 1:17:47.354
Where'd that come from?

1:17:47.389 --> 1:17:49.158
Wait! What's that?

1:17:49.897 --> 1:17:53.327
Skip, look! It's our boys,
come for the invasion!

1:17:54.803 --> 1:17:57.001
Woo! Yeah!

1:18:00.743 --> 1:18:03.942
[cheering]

1:18:03.977 --> 1:18:05.207
USA, baby!

1:18:13.921 --> 1:18:15.756
Well, I guess I figured
I didn't have a choice.

1:18:15.791 --> 1:18:17.285
That's no excuse, Lieutenant.

1:18:17.958 --> 1:18:19.386
You were given a direct order
to stand down

1:18:19.421 --> 1:18:21.454
when you attacked
those Kraut guns.

1:18:21.489 --> 1:18:23.357
You put American lives
at risk.

1:18:24.063 --> 1:18:25.095
Yes, sir.
It's entirely my fault.

1:18:25.130 --> 1:18:26.294
I take full--

1:18:26.329 --> 1:18:28.868
Damn right!
That was your fault.

1:18:28.903 --> 1:18:31.101
We didn't have enough gas to
make it back to base, sir, so--

1:18:31.136 --> 1:18:32.938
You chose to engage the enemy

1:18:32.973 --> 1:18:34.940
in direct violation
of my orders.

1:18:34.975 --> 1:18:38.108
We knew how important those 88s
were to German defenses, sir.

1:18:38.143 --> 1:18:41.848
Did you or did you not receive
my instructions

1:18:41.883 --> 1:18:43.850
to steer clear of the enemy
until further notice?

1:18:44.215 --> 1:18:46.248
Um, yes and no.

1:18:48.516 --> 1:18:50.417
Yes or no, Lieutenant?

1:18:50.991 --> 1:18:52.221
Yes, sir.

1:18:52.553 --> 1:18:54.289
Now you listen carefully and you
listen good

1:18:54.324 --> 1:18:56.456
because
I'm only gonna say this once.

1:18:57.129 --> 1:18:59.393
Although I'm tempted to
court martial your ass,

1:19:00.132 --> 1:19:02.132
that was one of
the most brilliantly executed

1:19:02.167 --> 1:19:04.838
commando raids
I've ever heard of.

1:19:05.973 --> 1:19:08.336
And I've been in
this game a long, long time.

1:19:08.371 --> 1:19:09.876
Thank you, sir.

1:19:09.911 --> 1:19:12.076
Snow, if you ever disobey
an order of mine again,

1:19:12.111 --> 1:19:14.012
I'll have your ass in a sling.

1:19:14.883 --> 1:19:18.951
Having said that, and I can't
endorse that behavior...

1:19:19.954 --> 1:19:22.383
we will now be in Rome
in less than a week.

1:19:23.584 --> 1:19:25.419
Anything we can do to help, sir?

1:19:26.488 --> 1:19:27.894
I don't know much, Lieutenant,

1:19:29.095 --> 1:19:30.523
but I do know that the U.S. Navy
is gonna need

1:19:30.558 --> 1:19:33.262
some top-notch commanders if
we're gonna beat the Japanese.

1:19:34.001 --> 1:19:35.267
Yes, sir.

1:19:35.303 --> 1:19:38.234
Do you think you could command
a heavy cruiser in the Pacific?

1:19:39.908 --> 1:19:41.006
Sir...

1:19:41.041 --> 1:19:42.172
We'll be in touch, Lieutenant.

1:19:45.573 --> 1:19:47.045
We're doing okay.

1:19:56.485 --> 1:19:58.892
They're calling the invasion
"Operation Avalanche."

1:20:00.027 --> 1:20:01.191
I like that.

1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:04.359
The doc says they're gonna
be sending you home, Moose.

1:20:04.394 --> 1:20:05.593
What do you think?

1:20:05.629 --> 1:20:07.560
You mean, you'd have to pull
your own weight for a change?

1:20:07.595 --> 1:20:10.002
I don't like it
any more than you do.

1:20:10.565 --> 1:20:14.534
"The U.S. Fifth Army, working in
coordination with the British,

1:20:14.569 --> 1:20:16.470
who landed a division in
Taranto."

1:20:18.177 --> 1:20:19.374
Throw in the fact
that Italy surrendered,

1:20:19.409 --> 1:20:22.146
and this is big,
very, very big.

1:20:22.181 --> 1:20:23.147
Ow.

1:20:25.085 --> 1:20:27.250
All right, Moose,
see you in the funny papers!

1:20:27.285 --> 1:20:28.922
Aye, aye, you betcha!

1:20:29.353 --> 1:20:31.089
Hey, Cookie, wait!

1:20:31.619 --> 1:20:34.587
Just, you know, in case you
get in another scrape.

1:20:35.458 --> 1:20:37.062
You know me too well, Irish!

1:20:42.300 --> 1:20:46.137
Hey, Bauer, Ford wants
to see you in the wardroom.

1:20:46.172 --> 1:20:47.369
What does that jerk want?

1:20:48.977 --> 1:20:50.207
Ask him yourself.

1:21:01.253 --> 1:21:02.085
Marca said you--

1:21:02.121 --> 1:21:03.517
You ever heard of
knocking, sailor?

1:21:06.291 --> 1:21:07.389
Sorry, sir.

1:21:08.656 --> 1:21:09.963
[knocking]

1:21:09.998 --> 1:21:11.261
Come in.

1:21:13.265 --> 1:21:15.067
Marca said you wanted
to see me, sir?

1:21:15.531 --> 1:21:17.168
Bauer, Bauer.

1:21:18.006 --> 1:21:20.402
Oh, yeah. Run those charts
up to the skipper

1:21:20.437 --> 1:21:21.535
on the bridge for me, would you?

1:21:25.310 --> 1:21:26.342
Seriously?

1:21:26.982 --> 1:21:28.113
Yes, seriously.

1:21:35.584 --> 1:21:37.023
It's all yours, Bauer.

1:21:38.620 --> 1:21:40.158
Yes, sir!
It's...

1:21:40.963 --> 1:21:42.424
It's beautiful!

1:21:43.361 --> 1:21:44.998
I knew you were gonna piss me
off at some point.

1:21:45.033 --> 1:21:47.000
But I didn't want you
to be without a fishing rod,

1:21:47.035 --> 1:21:48.364
so... you know.

1:21:50.566 --> 1:21:52.104
This doesn't mean
we're friends now, does it?

1:21:52.535 --> 1:21:54.909
Don't get carried away...
get out of here.

1:21:57.177 --> 1:21:58.440
Hey, shut the door!

1:21:58.475 --> 1:22:00.277
Sorry, sir.
Thank you again, sir.

1:22:00.312 --> 1:22:01.509
Oh, my God.

1:22:14.062 --> 1:22:15.556
[crying]

1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:22.662
I'm gonna miss your
philosophy lessons, Ken.

1:22:25.205 --> 1:22:26.941
I got a little something
for you

1:22:29.143 --> 1:22:31.605
just in case you get stuck
with a pair of sixes.

1:22:55.334 --> 1:22:57.037
She all battened down?

1:22:57.072 --> 1:22:59.105
She's not sinking anymore.

1:22:59.734 --> 1:23:00.733
Small victories.

1:23:03.111 --> 1:23:04.242
How you holding up?

1:23:05.411 --> 1:23:08.114
Well, luckily, I wasn't killed,
only slightly injured.

1:23:11.482 --> 1:23:13.746
Grovener was one hell
of a sailor, wasn't he?

1:23:14.650 --> 1:23:15.748
One of the best.

1:23:15.783 --> 1:23:16.991
Yeah.

1:23:18.027 --> 1:23:19.455
Right or wrong,
when you're captain of the ship,

1:23:20.722 --> 1:23:21.588
you have to make decisions

1:23:21.623 --> 1:23:23.558
where men's lives
hang in the balance.

1:23:24.528 --> 1:23:25.725
It just has to be that way.

1:23:28.136 --> 1:23:29.663
That was no accident
those thunderbolts

1:23:29.698 --> 1:23:30.731
had their way with the Germans.

1:23:31.502 --> 1:23:33.634
The enemy had those 88s,
that wouldn't have happened.

1:23:33.669 --> 1:23:35.075
That was your doing, Skip.

1:23:35.803 --> 1:23:37.374
Suppose it was.

1:23:40.082 --> 1:23:41.312
You think these
actions are gonna get you

1:23:41.347 --> 1:23:42.775
back on a warship
where you belong?

1:23:45.153 --> 1:23:46.548
Well, if it does,

1:23:48.420 --> 1:23:50.288
would you care to be
my second in command?

1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:54.358
And miss running fruits
and vegetables up the coast?

1:23:55.856 --> 1:23:57.295
I'd be honored.

1:24:00.861 --> 1:24:02.432
Let's get this thing
up and running.

1:24:02.467 --> 1:24:04.038
Yes, sir.
