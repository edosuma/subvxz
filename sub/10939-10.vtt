Previously on 'Heartland':

00:02.902 --> 00:04.902
Can l have another one?

00:08.341 --> 00:09.910
What's the deal with you, guys?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.877
What, he didn't tell you?

00:13.246 --> 00:14.781
l was married to his daughter.

00:14.881 --> 00:16.315
You're Amy and Lou's dad?

00:16.416 --> 00:17.350
Soraya, right?

00:17.450 --> 00:18.451
Yeah, hi.

00:18.551 --> 00:19.252
Hey, l'm Ben.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.421
l know.
l've heard a lot about you.

00:21.521 --> 00:21.988
This whole time l've been here,

00:22.088 --> 00:25.258
nobody said a word about Lou
or Amy having a father.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.793
l just figured he was dead or something.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.194
Well, he might as well have been.

00:28.294 --> 00:29.963
Oh, my God, Mom, it's Nick Harwell.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.164
Who's Nick Harwell?

00:31.264 --> 00:32.732
Only the hottest jumper on the circuit.

00:32.832 --> 00:33.566
Oh, my God.

00:33.666 --> 00:34.901
What?

00:35.001 --> 00:37.001
lt's Nick Harwell.

MALLORY: Hello, l'm here.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.418
Where is everybody?

00:55.155 --> 00:58.249
Amy? Ty?

01:02.062 --> 01:05.206
l can't believe they left without me.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.501
Well, l didn't even know they still existed.

01:08.601 --> 01:12.628
l mean, l figured a Mustang was just a car.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.508
Well, a herd of them came
too far down the mountain.

01:15.608 --> 01:18.311
A couple of them already got shot.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.621
Why would anybody do that?

01:20.713 --> 01:23.383
Cattle ranchers think
they're a waste of grass.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.652
My dad and Ray want to ship them
back up to the mountains,

01:25.752 --> 01:29.407
so at least they'll be safe for the winter.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.817
What are they doing?

01:34.928 --> 01:36.928
l don't know.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.970
We never let a horse go
until we've made absolutely certain...

01:44.070 --> 01:48.320
...that its temperament is suited
to its new owner.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.077
You said your daughter's 1 2 years old?

01:51.177 --> 01:54.874
l have at least one horse that might work.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.717
We have a 1 2-year-old neighbor,
and she's riding one of our horses...

01:57.817 --> 02:00.787
...that she's completely compatible with.

02:00.887 --> 02:04.090
Oh, yeah, Copper
is absolutely perfect for her.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.624
Calm, gentle, broken in.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.429
l'm sure we can match your daughter
up with one of our horses.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.064
LOU: We've just...
- Lou?

02:11.164 --> 02:15.897
Yes, yes, we can definitely work
something out.

02:16.269 --> 02:17.937
l'm on the phone.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.240
So, great, see you tomorrow, then.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.501
LOU: Perfect.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.658
Hey, check out that one.

02:34.220 --> 02:37.090
That's a stallion.
You see those markings?

02:37.190 --> 02:40.165
That's a classic Appaloosa Mustang.

02:40.793 --> 02:43.819
Hey. This is private property.

02:43.930 --> 02:48.334
We're just here to see the Mustangs.
ls Ray around? Or Tim Fleming?

02:48.434 --> 02:51.232
You see them? 'Cause l don't.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.706
Well, then, who are you, guys?

02:53.806 --> 02:57.003
l work for Ray.
Now get outta here.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.543
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.049
Hey. Ty.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.413
You got a problem, man?

03:06.519 --> 03:06.986
Huh?

03:07.086 --> 03:09.126
Ty. No. Forget about it.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.125
Next time.

03:23.836 --> 03:26.639
You better pray there ain't no next time.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.374
Ty.

03:28.474 --> 03:30.474
Let's go.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.713
Yeah, Ty. Do what your
little girlfriend tells you.

03:33.813 --> 03:36.441
Please, Ty.

03:42.021 --> 03:43.456
Give me half a dozen.

03:43.556 --> 03:47.466
Make sure they got
some meat on them this time.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.641
But l really need somebody...

04:36.342 --> 04:37.343

04:42.115 --> 04:44.640
...when Marion Fleming died?

04:44.751 --> 04:46.751
Yeah. Spartan.

04:47.820 --> 04:48.988
l've heard Amy's brought him...

04:49.088 --> 04:50.290
...a long way since then.

04:50.390 --> 04:54.130
Excuse me?
l thought this was about my horse.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.489
Hey, Ben, l'm doing this...

04:57.563 --> 04:59.599
...as a favor to your aunt.

04:59.699 --> 05:03.829
So lose the attitude, okay?

05:12.612 --> 05:14.612
Nick. What are...?

05:15.281 --> 05:16.849
l haven't seen you in ages.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.585
Yeah. l was thinking something...

05:18.685 --> 05:19.719
...along those lines...

05:19.819 --> 05:21.988
...when Lisa Stillman called me up...

05:22.088 --> 05:24.357
...and asked me to coach her nephew.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.620
Oh, lucky you.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.229
Yeah.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.891
l saw Spartan at a few shows.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.702
A year or so ago.

05:35.802 --> 05:36.936
Didn't matter who was riding him,

05:37.036 --> 05:38.605
he always took the fences nice and clean.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.540
That's a special talent.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.767
And l was thinking if...

05:42.875 --> 05:43.910
Well, if Amy's not interested...

05:44.010 --> 05:44.611
...in showing him,

05:44.711 --> 05:47.447
l know some people who'd pay good
money for an honest horse like that.

05:47.547 --> 05:50.744
Oh, Amy would never sell him.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.020
But, just out of curiosity,
how much money?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.556
Well, um, you know, that depends.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.626
The way l do business, it's not
just about buying and selling.

05:59.726 --> 06:02.962
lt's about establishing
a relationship, you know,

06:03.062 --> 06:06.293
not a one time deal,
something ongoing.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.596
Uh, that is an interesting approach.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.394
Do you want to have lunch with me?

06:14.841 --> 06:16.476
We can talk about it.

06:16.576 --> 06:20.741
l'm working with Ben tomorrow.
Maybe the next day?

06:20.913 --> 06:22.938
Yeah, l guess.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.049
Sure. Okay.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.685
Hey, Lou.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.491
Hey, Nick.

06:31.591 --> 06:34.260
Hope l'm not interrupting anything.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.261
No, no, l was just leaving.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.888
l'll see you later, Lou.

06:44.170 --> 06:44.871
[ Clears throat ]

06:44.971 --> 06:50.068
That was some, uh,
nice timing there, Mr. Cardinal.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.970
You didn't plan that, did you?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.547
Planned what?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.711
Unbelievable.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.188
You should be glad
you weren't there, Mallory.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.524
There were these creepy guys
with a livestock trailer.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.392
Ty almost got into a fight with one of them.

07:06.492 --> 07:07.794
No, l didn't.

07:07.894 --> 07:11.564
Mustangs? Creepy guys? Fist fights?
What makes me happy l didn't come?

07:11.664 --> 07:13.766
One of them said he worked for Ray.

07:13.866 --> 07:14.967
Mmmm, that figures.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.270
Ray's gonna keep them penned up
for a couple of days.

07:17.370 --> 07:21.341
So l can get the DNA tested,
see if they really are Mustangs.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.209
What else would they be?

07:23.309 --> 07:25.678
Well, they could be
domestic horses gone wild.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.847
But real Mustangs aren't just feral horses.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.116
Their bloodlines date all the way
back to the Conquistadors,

07:30.216 --> 07:31.351
and they were originally
brought to Alberta...

07:31.451 --> 07:35.021
...by the Blackfoot lndians in the 1 630s.

07:38.090 --> 07:42.000
What? l wrote an essay on them
in grade eleven.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.896
Well, that's why l'm gonna test them.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.865
lf they really are Mustangs,

07:45.965 --> 07:49.535
they're one step closer
to being a protected species.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.938
You should come, Jack.
l could use the help.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.163
Mind if l bring Ty along?

07:56.742 --> 07:59.734
l figure your dad's gonna be there,

07:59.846 --> 08:03.926
and l'm gonna need someone
to break up the fight.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.518
That was a joke.

08:09.222 --> 08:12.749
Wild horses couldn't keep me away.

08:14.794 --> 08:18.025
That was a joke too.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.938
Hey, Nick was asking about Spartan today.

08:26.038 --> 08:27.440
What about Spartan?

08:27.540 --> 08:29.208
l don't know if this is the right time,

08:29.308 --> 08:31.778
but l'd like to discuss the Copper situation.

08:31.878 --> 08:34.514
What are you talking about, Mallory?
There is no Copper situation.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.815
Anyway, he was saying...

08:35.914 --> 08:38.384
...he had some clients
who were seriously interested--...

08:38.484 --> 08:40.086
...lnterested in what? Buying him?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.450
Yes, actually.

08:42.554 --> 08:43.756
Well, l'm not selling.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.390
l know, Amy.

08:44.490 --> 08:48.361
l'm just saying that you should
really think about showing him.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.297
And when do you think l'll have time
for that? Hmm?

08:51.397 --> 08:56.327
l've got school, the other horses.
l have no time to train.

08:56.435 --> 08:58.435
All right, whatever.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.662
l should do my homework.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.279
l hate your sister.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.325
Sometimes l'm not so thrilled
with her either.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.296
The Fall Finale Entry?
l thought you were doing homework.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.763
l was working on homework, Mallory.

09:27.199 --> 09:30.136
So, did Lou say anything to you
about Copper?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.637
Why would she?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.006
So the word re-homing never came up?

09:34.106 --> 09:36.042
No one is re-homing Copper, okay?

09:36.142 --> 09:38.010
Lou never said anything to me
about it, not once.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.779
She never said anything to me either.

09:39.879 --> 09:45.518
You're just being paranoid. l've got
to do the night check on the horses.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.788
Why are you in my room? And
why are you wearing my bathrobe?

09:48.888 --> 09:51.390
Who's paranoid now?
l'm sleeping over.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.890
Don't worry.
My mom and dad said l could.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.000
l can't believe my grandpa's
actually going up to Ray's,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.035
after what happened with my dad last time.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.605
l guess the pull of wild horses
is stronger than any grudge...

10:05.705 --> 10:07.340
...he might be holding.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.843
Yeah, it's funny.
l, uh, l wrote that paper.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.479
'The Living Heritage of the West.'

10:13.579 --> 10:15.147
And l've lived here for most of my life,

10:15.247 --> 10:18.184
but l've never actually seen a Mustang.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.854
When l was a kid, my grandpa,
he swore me to secrecy,

10:21.954 --> 10:27.226
but he took me to his special place,
and, uh, l saw a whole herd.

10:27.326 --> 10:33.526
Oh, l'd like to see that. l mean,
l don't know, maybe one day.

10:34.433 --> 10:39.564
So. There is a part of you
that still likes horses?

10:40.039 --> 10:44.204
Don't tell anyone.
l have a reputation to protect.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.271
Have a good night.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.381
Good night.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.551
Hm...

10:56.689 --> 10:59.025
Everybody says Spartan used to be
a pretty good jumper.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.491
Used to be.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.864
l've seen the ribbons on your wall, Amy.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.939
But there's room for a couple more.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.704
You know, if it was just him and me,
l would be fine.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.602
But it's Lou, it's Nick.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.642
lt's everybody who knows
about the accident,

11:16.742 --> 11:19.939
who knows he's not just a horse,

11:20.446 --> 11:24.016
he's the horse my mom died trying to save.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.117
Yeah.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.755
l guess it's a lot harder to get
a horse over one of those jumps...

11:29.855 --> 11:33.085
...when he's carrying so much baggage.

11:33.125 --> 11:37.425
But if anyone can do it, you can.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.278
Yes.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.512
Can you put that up for me?

12:10.463 --> 12:12.463
Come on.

12:14.533 --> 12:15.368
l got it.

12:15.468 --> 12:19.097
No, don't bother.
l'm done for the day.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.608
Come on.
At least, one more try.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.210
TY: You gotta end on a good note, right?

12:24.310 --> 12:25.244
AMY: l've gotta go to school.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.780
Hey. Did you move my jumps?

12:28.914 --> 12:32.518
l look out my window, and l see
all my jumps have been moved.

12:32.618 --> 12:36.443
Well, if it's such a big deal,
move them back.

12:36.555 --> 12:39.530
Well, you heard her.
Move them back.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.933
l mean, talk about a wake up call.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.703
When l saw you were looking
at the entry form for the Fall Finale,

12:50.803 --> 12:52.304
l had an epiphany.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.396
l should enter Copper too.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.811
Well, Copper isn't really a jumping
horse, he's never been trained.

12:58.911 --> 13:03.549
And he's not my horse.
That's what you really mean, isn't it?

13:03.649 --> 13:05.484
Come on, we're gonna be late for the bus.

13:05.584 --> 13:06.485
lsn't Lou driving us?

13:06.585 --> 13:10.022
No, she's got some people
coming to look at horses.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.991
Which horses?

13:12.091 --> 13:14.641
Just give it a rest.
Get ready.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.931
Wait. What about your stuff?

13:19.031 --> 13:19.832
Where are you going?

13:19.932 --> 13:21.500
l'm not going to school.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.269
Why not?

13:23.369 --> 13:26.133
l'm taking a mental health day.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.255
Can l help you?

13:43.355 --> 13:45.458
l'm looking for Lou Fleming.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.359
Oh, is this Copper?

13:47.459 --> 13:48.694
How did you know that?

13:48.794 --> 13:51.174
Well, Lou told me about him.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.898
You know, l've got a daughter
just about your age,

13:52.998 --> 13:55.401
who would die for a horse like this.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.303
Well, she might have to.

13:57.403 --> 14:01.774
l mean, he's a very difficult horse.
Pig-headed. Bad-tempered.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.342
Basically, unridable.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.945
Well, he certainly seems
calm enough to me.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.246
Now maybe.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.181
l definitely wouldn't wanna be
in a stall with him...

14:09.281 --> 14:10.916
...when his meds wear off.

14:11.016 --> 14:11.851
Lou assured me--

14:11.951 --> 14:15.546
She's depressed.
She's desperate.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.023
l mean, so many horses,
so little time.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.693
And when a well-meaning horse lover
like you calls...

14:20.793 --> 14:24.029
Uh, you know, l think it's probably
better if l talked to her myself.

14:24.129 --> 14:29.465
She's not here. She's out of town.
On 'vacation'.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.702
Hm...

14:41.247 --> 14:43.482
You know, l gotta say, Jack,

14:43.582 --> 14:46.652
l kind of respect you,
coming up here to help Ray,

14:46.752 --> 14:47.853
with your history and everything.

14:47.953 --> 14:51.357
The only history l give a damn about
is those Mustangs.

14:51.457 --> 14:54.160
My plan -- and this'll be your plan too --...

14:54.260 --> 14:58.297
...is we're just gonna watch,
strictly as observers.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.397
l'm down with the plan.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.669
l'm down with you being down
with the plan.

15:04.770 --> 15:10.402
Not going to let your friend Tim
get my goat, not this time.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.712
Hey, Mallory, have you seen...?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.649
l can see you there.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.117
Have you seen Mrs. Wiley?

15:23.222 --> 15:24.690
Who?

15:24.790 --> 15:28.851
No. Oh, she left.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.029
What did you say to her?

15:30.129 --> 15:33.621
Nothing. Hardly nothing. Why?

15:36.568 --> 15:37.937
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

15:38.037 --> 15:41.974
All the important stuff's
already over. Recess, Gym, Art.

15:42.074 --> 15:45.474
Now all that's left is science and math.

15:45.477 --> 15:49.004
Mrs. Wiley? Hi. lt's Lou.

15:50.049 --> 15:53.052
Yeah, l'm sorry for the inconvenience.

15:53.152 --> 15:56.849
How about four o'clock this afternoon?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.591
Okay, thanks for your patience.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.273
We're gonna start by separating
the mares from the studs,

16:14.373 --> 16:17.773
then funnel them into the squeeze chute.

16:19.778 --> 16:21.714
Hey, what happened to the rest of them?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.983
The last time l was here,
there was a lot more.

16:24.083 --> 16:24.884
You sure about that?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.819
Yeah. There was an Appaloosa stallion.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.622
Amy said it looked just like a Mustang.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.758
Well, l'm betting
a lot of these horses are Mustangs.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.326
What do you think, Jack?

16:34.426 --> 16:36.792
The configuration's wrong.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.497
You gotta widen that alleyway there,

16:38.597 --> 16:41.467
or you're never going to get them in
without a fight.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.936
Well, that's the way Tim wanted it.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.871
There's your second problem right there.

16:45.971 --> 16:49.626
Tim Fleming
is basically a weekend wrangler.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.878
You got a cuttin' horse ready to go?

16:52.978 --> 16:54.413
Yes, l do.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.488
You still down with the plan, Jack?

17:04.823 --> 17:16.030
Peanut butter, crackers,
juice boxes, cell phone.

17:16.135 --> 17:20.333
Not that anyone cares enough
about me to call.

17:20.705 --> 17:24.403
Last but not least, toilet paper.

17:30.649 --> 17:36.986
lf Lou wants to re-home you,
she's gonna have to find you first.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.792
So, what can l tell you?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.528
Nick came to see Red,
and he was totally psyched.

17:42.628 --> 17:42.962
That's so awesome.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.597
l have to come watch you train.
lsn't that awesome, Amy?

17:45.697 --> 17:47.232
Totally.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.768
What's the matter with you?
Why are you being so negative?

17:49.868 --> 17:52.071
Ben getting coached by Nick is huge.

17:52.171 --> 17:57.165
Nick? Nick Harwell?
He only works with top level riders.

17:57.309 --> 18:00.005
That's why he's coaching Ben.

18:00.112 --> 18:01.580
Oh, it's about time.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.682
At the show last week you did so well,

18:03.782 --> 18:05.384
it's crazy you didn't get a ribbon.

18:05.484 --> 18:08.887
Yeah, l know. l mean, that last fence,
the rail wasn't even in the cup.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.422
Red barely touched it,
and it came down.

18:10.522 --> 18:12.725
The jump crew
was so obviously incompetent.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.660
l couldn't believe you didn't
complain to the judge.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.496
Yeah, well, that's why
l've gotta work with Nick.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.931
l mean, the guy's connected.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.066
Stuff like that doesn't happen to his people.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.602
Yeah, but, Ben, l mean,
no matter what you do,

18:23.702 --> 18:27.706
l'm still going to beat your ass
at the Fall Finale.

18:27.806 --> 18:32.072
Speaking of which, Amy,
l saw the entry list.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.545
l didn't see your name on it.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.914
l thought you'd be riding
that washed up show-jumper...

18:36.014 --> 18:38.384
...you've got sitting in your back field.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.886
Why don't you ask Nick
how washed up my horse is?

18:40.986 --> 18:43.876
He's the one who wants to buy him.

18:45.724 --> 18:50.525
But, hey, what does he know
about show jumping, right?

18:59.505 --> 19:04.265
Yeah, l'm telling you,
they've been down there for weeks.

19:04.610 --> 19:08.480
Yeah, we'll pick up another dozen
and get 'em all down to you tonight.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.580
All right.

19:18.023 --> 19:21.253
Going the wrong way there,
little girl.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.893
Come on.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.916
Jack Bartlett,
on one of my cuttin' horses.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.284
Never thought l'd see the day.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.886
l figured this had to be one of yours.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.955
You never did have much luck
picking horses.

19:50.055 --> 19:53.025
So, you came all the way up here
just to insult me?

19:53.125 --> 19:54.493
[ Laughs ]

19:54.593 --> 19:59.131
Well, the way l see it, it's a two-man
operation, so we'll work as a team.

19:59.231 --> 20:02.835
Oh, like the old days?
Yeah, so you're the boss?

20:02.935 --> 20:08.006
Got that right. And the intervening
years will be temporarily forgotten.

20:08.106 --> 20:12.478
l'll cut the horse from the herd,
you drive it down the chute.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.103
Okay, Jack.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.355
Aim for the middle.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.455
Nicely done.

20:26.625 --> 20:32.490
Support him with your inside leg,
so he doesn't fall in at the corner.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.998
Yeah, Ben.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.370
Since when did you become
a big show jumping fan?

20:38.470 --> 20:41.340
What? Just because l don't go on
and on about it like you do.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.465
Or since you met Nick?

20:43.575 --> 20:49.673
Oh, come on, Amy.
He's just like... bonus.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.247
Okay, let the horse catch his breath.

20:56.488 --> 21:01.126
Not bad, this kid. l'm surprised
he doesn't do better at competitions.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.028
What do you think, Amy?

21:03.128 --> 21:06.427
Um, l don't know, it could be nerves.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.433
You don't sound convinced.

21:08.533 --> 21:11.837
What's the deal, Amy? You've
seen him ride a million times.

21:11.937 --> 21:17.204
Yeah. Without moving the jumps
or changing the course.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.549
Hey, Ben.

21:23.649 --> 21:24.349
Yeah?

21:24.449 --> 21:26.118
We're gonna reverse the course.

21:26.218 --> 21:30.989
Want you to pop over these
two fences, going away from home.

21:31.089 --> 21:33.887
Uh, that way?

21:33.992 --> 21:35.427
l don't get it.
What's the point?

21:35.527 --> 21:38.332
Just gonna shake things up a bit.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.563
All right.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.109
He took off too early.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.707
That time, he went too deep.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.954
Your sister's right.
He can't see a distance.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.790
lf he doesn't learn that,
he's got no real future as a jumper.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.325
Are you talking about Red?

22:06.425 --> 22:09.485
No. That horse is fine.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.594

Okay, boss, whatever you say.

Hey, that's the guy.
When l came up here with Amy...

23:04.249 --> 23:06.544
Hold her steady, would you?

23:09.388 --> 23:12.108
l got a really bad vibe off him.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.958
Come on.

23:16.027 --> 23:18.230
A whole lotta bull just to set 'em free again.

Yeah, 60 cents a pound.
That's all they're worth.

23:24.603 --> 23:26.628

25:14.980 --> 25:17.955
l don't know what's wrong with him.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.583
Maybe he's a little stiff in his hocks.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.791

27:07.559 --> 27:08.793
When l was watching you,
l realized...

27:08.893 --> 27:10.462
...why you got so mad
when we moved your jumps.

27:10.562 --> 27:14.589
