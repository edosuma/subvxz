34:30.236 --> 34:31.702
<i>a surgical room for me.</i>

34:31.704 --> 34:33.536
<i>- It's easy to entertain up here</i>

34:33.538 --> 34:35.840
because the space is so open.

34:35.842 --> 34:37.507
- I think it's my favorite
part of it.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.076
I love having friends
over and cooking, so...

34:40.078 --> 34:41.979
- I almost don't want
to mess it up.

34:41.981 --> 34:43.746
- I was looking at the comps
in the area,

34:43.748 --> 34:45.115
basically, residential comps.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.384
- Yeah.
- Nothing really like this.

34:46.386 --> 34:49.185
It's pretty unique.
But it seems a little high.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.787
- Yes, we are expensive.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.189
But I gotta be honest,
at $4,500 a foot,

34:53.191 --> 34:55.926
I think it is in line
for something this special.

34:55.928 --> 34:59.063
Let's see.
Who else we have coming by?

34:59.065 --> 35:01.632
- We have Fredrik confirmed.

35:01.634 --> 35:02.999
- Great.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.401
Wait for this.
The ego on that one.

35:05.403 --> 35:07.137
Remember the listing on Beverly,

35:07.139 --> 35:09.806
and it's just taken some time
to kind of solidify it?

35:09.808 --> 35:10.874
- Right.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.876
- We got it, and the same day,

35:12.878 --> 35:15.011
I get a text from Fredrik.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.147
It literally says,
"Just want you to know

35:17.149 --> 35:20.249
"that I told Justin at Beverly
to work with you.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.418
"I'm declining the job.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.587
It's a great house,
and it's gonna sell."

35:24.589 --> 35:26.489
Am I, like,
overreacting a little,

35:26.491 --> 35:29.159
or is that the most
condescending text ever.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.896
Like, you're gonna send me the
text saying you turned it down?

35:31.898 --> 35:34.565
- Right, no, that's
definitely a little awkward.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.634
- I'm sorry, but, like,
it's totally awkward.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.904
He would never send that text
to, like, Altman, and be, like,

35:40.906 --> 35:42.238
"Yeah, I turned it down for you.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.973
Best of luck.
Go with God."

35:43.975 --> 35:45.575
Like, who says that?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.510
Maybe he just had a little bit
of a tough time losing to me.

35:47.512 --> 35:52.182
I don't know, but
I'm gonna behave, I promise.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.516
About a week ago,

35:53.518 --> 35:55.652
I went on a listing appointment
in West Hollywood

35:55.654 --> 35:57.287
<i>with this guy named Justin.</i>

35:57.289 --> 35:59.589
<i>Apparently,
Fredrik was also up for it,</i>

35:59.591 --> 36:01.057
but I didn't know that

36:01.059 --> 36:03.660
until he sent me
a cute little text yesterday.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.195
- I'm gonna head out.
- Oh.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.930
- Looks like you got it, so...
- Thank you, darling.

36:06.932 --> 36:09.866
That text irked me,
but, at the same time,

36:09.868 --> 36:11.735
I have a listing
that I have to show him,

36:11.737 --> 36:13.269
and he's gonna have
clients for it.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.805
- Hello!

36:15.807 --> 36:18.942
Wow, Tracy?
- Here I come.

36:18.944 --> 36:22.679
- Oh, my God, that's a vision.
Architecturally stunning.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.948
Sense of fashion
and a beautiful hat.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.617
I feel like I'm
in a real estate Western,

36:27.619 --> 36:29.152
like, joo, joo, joo, joo--

36:29.154 --> 36:30.754
- I know!
- Joo, joo, joo, joo, joo!

36:30.756 --> 36:33.156
- I told you I was gonna bring
my hat game today.

36:33.158 --> 36:34.891
- I mean, I have six of these,
and Derek is like,

36:34.893 --> 36:36.325
"First of all,
you never wear them.

36:36.327 --> 36:38.327
Second of all, you're crazy."

36:38.329 --> 36:39.429
- But I'm obsessed.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.830
- But do you have a normal head?

36:40.832 --> 36:44.500
- No, I have a gigantic head,
like you.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.803
- Okay, show me around.

36:46.805 --> 36:51.641
<i>- So this is the
lounge, hang, creative space.</i>

36:51.643 --> 36:53.309
<i>Two office suites here.</i>

36:53.311 --> 36:56.246
- It's, like, a very, like,
Tribeca townhouse, New York.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.181
I actually reached out
to clients in New York.

36:58.183 --> 36:59.516
- Mm-hmm.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.651
- But I have somebody
from San Francisco.

37:01.653 --> 37:05.121
It's a startup tech,
and they need an incubator.

37:05.123 --> 37:07.824
Like, this could really work.
- Yeah.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.926
You've got a full AI system,

37:09.928 --> 37:13.730
<i>so that you can operate
all the lights, security.</i>

37:13.732 --> 37:16.400
[beeping]
That's the AI.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.533
- What was that?

37:17.535 --> 37:20.303
I thought it was a speaker.

37:20.305 --> 37:23.473
- So up here,

37:28.346 --> 37:31.114

37:32.552 --> 37:34.517

37:34.519 --> 37:38.455
- A little over 4,000.
- You're asking 4,300 a foot?

37:38.457 --> 37:40.089
- Well, it's a big number.
- It's pretty!

37:40.091 --> 37:41.892
I mean, what can you say?
Listen, all power to you.

37:41.894 --> 37:44.393
If you can get it--this
is so beautiful.

37:44.395 --> 37:47.297
Typically speaking,
properties that are classified

37:47.299 --> 37:50.099
as residential
are worth far more

37:50.101 --> 37:51.768

37:51.770 --> 37:55.171
I mean, don't get me wrong,
the place is fabulous.

37:55.173 --> 38:00.543
But $4,500 a foot, in Venice?

38:00.545 --> 38:02.779
That is a lot.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.781
It's really beautiful.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.349
It's just,
for 4,000 square feet,

38:06.351 --> 38:08.285
might be a little expensive.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.920
- I mean, that's rich
coming from you.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.656
I mean, you tend
to overprice things.

38:13.658 --> 38:14.858
- I do?

38:14.860 --> 38:17.660
- I mean, your text
yesterday was charming.

38:17.662 --> 38:18.795
- What text?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.130
- The text that you sent me

38:20.132 --> 38:23.066
about the house on Beverly
with Justin.

38:23.068 --> 38:26.602
And I commented back that,
you know, thanks,

38:26.604 --> 38:28.739
but you overpriced it
by a million.

38:28.741 --> 38:30.273
- Oh, but I believe
in that price.

38:30.275 --> 38:31.674
What does that have to do
with this situation?

38:31.676 --> 38:33.476
This is 18 million.
That was, like, 6 million.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.211
I don't even remember.
5,700,000?

38:35.213 --> 38:38.749
- I don't know, do you
normally turn down listings?

38:38.751 --> 38:41.084
'Cause that was
the tone of the text,

38:41.086 --> 38:43.554
which I just found to be,
like, a little condescending.

38:43.556 --> 38:45.555
- Condescending to who,
to the seller, to you?

38:45.557 --> 38:45.622
- To me!

38:45.789 --> 38:53.789
- Do you normally turn
down listings?

38:53.998 --> 38:56.366
'Cause that was the tone
of the text,

38:56.368 --> 38:58.402
which I just found to be,
like, a little condescending.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.703
- Condescending to who,
to the seller, to you?

39:00.705 --> 39:02.506
- To me!

39:02.508 --> 39:04.107
When you go up
against Josh Altman,

39:04.109 --> 39:05.708
do you turn down listings?

39:05.710 --> 39:06.976
- I didn't know I was up
against you

39:06.978 --> 39:08.545
until they made
a whole stink about,

39:08.547 --> 39:11.714
you know, co-listing--Tracy
this, and I was just like, no.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.050
Why don't you list with her?
She's amazing.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.719
She's my friend.
Go with her.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.988
I was trying to be nice, write
a nice text, with a heart in.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.224
I really did, honestly!

39:21.226 --> 39:24.128
The fact that the owner
wanted us to co-list it is,

39:24.130 --> 39:26.797
I guess, in theory,
we had both of us.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.931
But I didn't give her
the listing.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.499
I stepped away from it.

39:30.501 --> 39:33.803
I simply texted her saying,
"You do it."

39:33.805 --> 39:35.472
I want nothing but the best
for you.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.573
I'm your friend.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.807
- Right.
- And instead of saying--

39:37.809 --> 39:39.142
- So rather than just lose,

39:39.144 --> 39:41.544
you had to text your competitor,

39:41.546 --> 39:43.613
which this time
happened to be me,

39:43.615 --> 39:45.081
and maybe that's not something--

39:45.083 --> 39:46.950
- I think that's--
- That you ever anticipated.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.385
I just--

39:48.387 --> 39:49.819
- This is all in your head.
- You know, being a female

39:49.821 --> 39:51.421
in the business--it's
not in my head!

39:51.423 --> 39:52.688
- Female, oh, it's, like,
a woman thing?

39:52.690 --> 39:54.757
You think I--
- I think it is!

39:54.759 --> 39:56.827
<i>[tense music]</i>

39:56.829 --> 39:58.961

39:58.963 --> 40:00.464
Are we, like, in the '70s?

40:00.466 --> 40:01.964
- I don't know.
You tell me.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.168
- Like, I have a female CEO,
a female COO.

40:04.170 --> 40:07.371
I take that very seriously.
I did not mean anything bad.

40:07.373 --> 40:11.574
- But can you see how it could
be received in a way

40:11.576 --> 40:13.776
that comes off
a little bit like,

40:13.778 --> 40:17.713
"Because I turned it down,
you're going to get this.

40:17.715 --> 40:18.915
Good for you.
Go get it."

40:18.917 --> 40:20.617
- That's not what I said.

40:20.619 --> 40:21.985
That's not what I said.
I didn't say because you're--

40:21.987 --> 40:23.454
- But that is how
it was received.

40:23.456 --> 40:25.021
- You don't even say
"I kind of understand."

40:25.023 --> 40:26.255
- No, I don't.
I don't understand.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.857
- Well, then, you know--

40:27.859 --> 40:29.659
- Because I know that I didn't
mean anything with that text.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.327
<i>Since I moved to Los Angeles,</i>

40:31.329 --> 40:34.563

to something negative.

screaming about it

I don't want to see you sad.
Like, I get sad, too.

But you have to understand
it's very hurtful to me

40:58.589 --> 41:01.090

You could text back and say--

41:01.092 --> 41:03.160
- (BLEEP), Fredrik,

41:03.162 --> 41:05.228

Whether or not you meant it
a certain way,

41:08.032 --> 41:10.534
that's how it was read.

it to be a female thing,

41:27.652 --> 41:30.052
How are we supposed
to negotiate with a bun?

41:30.054 --> 41:32.122

it's taken me to get here.

42:54.939 --> 42:56.272
- Whomever--
- A long time.

42:56.274 --> 42:57.873
- Whomever screws you,
I'm gonna beat up.

42:57.875 --> 42:59.676
I salute you as a woman.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.545
Everything that I am and stand
for is to lift up women,

43:02.547 --> 43:04.547
so that's why
it was very hurtful.

43:04.549 --> 43:08.484
I think, for me,
I want to say that I'm sorry.

43:08.486 --> 43:10.152
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

43:10.154 --> 43:11.754
Can I hug you?
Is it okay?

43:11.756 --> 43:15.091
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Come here.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.559
<i>- I don't even know</i>

43:16.561 --> 43:18.795

43:23.835 --> 43:26.168
<i>- What is the square footage
on this house?</i>

43:26.170 --> 43:28.672
- (BLEEP) the house.
It's all about the land.

43:28.674 --> 43:30.473
<i>- It's perfect.
How much?</i>

43:30.475 --> 43:32.842
- 13 million.

43:32.844 --> 43:34.977
- Any word?
- Nothing yet, honey.

43:34.979 --> 43:36.579
- Why is it taking so long?

43:36.581 --> 43:38.381
- I would have called him
in a second and say--

43:38.383 --> 43:39.915
- Okay, well...
- Clean up your act.

43:39.917 --> 43:41.951

<i>- Whoa!

43:43.856 --> 43:47.523

43:48.759 --> 43:50.626
- You're screwed.
You're screwed.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.764
- I love the fact that you've
got these Atraxa windows.

43:53.766 --> 43:56.098
- Except they're not Atraxa.
They're Schuco.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.533
- I meant Schuco, sorry.

43:57.535 --> 43:58.767
Can we open it?
I love the light in here.

43:58.769 --> 44:00.069
- Yeah, oh, you're pressing
the wrong button.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.404
- Oh, sh--.
- There you go.

44:01.406 --> 44:02.771
All right.
Don't touch anything else.

44:02.773 --> 44:04.473
- I'm just gonna shut up.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.475
What the (BLEEP) is wrong
with me today?

44:05.477 --> 44:07.076
I'm off my game!

44:07.078 --> 44:10.546
- Okay, guys, what do we have?
- They came in at $22 million.

44:10.548 --> 44:11.947
- Price is not negotiable.

44:11.949 --> 44:14.350
- You gotta come down from
your price, even if it's $1.

44:14.352 --> 44:15.885
- I heard from Yuri.

44:15.887 --> 44:17.319
- What did he say
about our meeting?

44:17.321 --> 44:20.290
- He asked me if I should
let you go off of the listing.
