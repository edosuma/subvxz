you don't take no pony and trap

Yes, ma'am, Grandma Rose.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.043
And oi, Clover!

03:30.126 --> 03:33.338
Really enjoyed this mix tape

I do everything for King Julien,

03:54.525 --> 03:58.488
but today is the day
I do something for me.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.405
On it!

03:59.489 --> 04:01.449

04:01.532 --> 04:02.992
-You went a little harsh on Clover.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.036

with all your talking, Maurice?

Come on, King Julien.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.600

like, the first time

04:27.684 --> 04:31.437
I've ever said no to Clover.
First time. Huh.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.314
You say no to her all the time.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.483
Uh, pretty sure I never have.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.151
No, Clover! No! No!

04:37.235 --> 04:38.403
Not a chance-ola!

04:38.486 --> 04:39.320
Nope.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.405

I say no, no, no, no, no...

04:47.954 --> 04:49.497
Pretty sure.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.750
Look, Your Majesty, this crazy tournament
means a lot to Clover.

04:52.834 --> 04:56.045
If she really wants to go to this thing,
you can't stop her.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.588
And maybe you shouldn't.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.758
Grammy always said,
"Set the butterfly free

05:00.842 --> 05:03.219
and if it gets caught in the spider web,

05:03.303 --> 05:07.765
there's gonna be a whole bunch
of spider babies come springtime."

05:07.890 --> 05:09.726
[laughs maniacally]

05:09.809 --> 05:10.977
Not helping, Mort.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.896
Mo-Mo, I've decided that you're wrong.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.775
If she really wants to go to this thing,
maybe I should just let her go.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.375

05:34.459 --> 05:38.171
Good news, Clover. I've decided
to let you go to that tourna--

05:38.254 --> 05:39.130
What?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.760
That saucy minx has disobeyed me.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.180
She has broken the law!
She will pay! [shouts] Pay!

05:47.263 --> 05:52.018
We'll go to this crazy death match thingie
and drag her home by force.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.793
Oh, golly. My darn agent
does not tell me a thing.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.671
You need to be getting me
better auditions.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.090
I don't know why I give you 40%.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.802
I'm starting to think
you're just a giant banana.

07:09.011 --> 07:12.640
Oh, welly-wellington, the show must go on.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.703
Oh,  ja, ja,  little man.

08:15.786 --> 08:20.625
Don't know where the bathroom is.
But, I can send you to the hoshpital.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.044
But I don't need to go to the hospital.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.713
-Oh, you will. [laughs]
-Ow.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.342

-Maurice is your friend

08:31.427 --> 08:33.012
and he's super worried about you

08:33.095 --> 08:36.307
and he'd feel sad if you got hurt.
I mean, just look at him.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.726
Look at that face. [shouts] Look at it!

08:38.809 --> 08:41.229
This is very important to me,
Your Majesty.

-And it's been a dream of mine

I mean, what is it?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.310
Don't worry, Mort. I will avenge you.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.606
Oi, you flankers.
Whichever one of yous hurt my Mort is

09:25.690 --> 09:26.732

[gasps]

09:27.733 --> 09:28.734

09:28.818 --> 09:30.486
Wigman Wildebeest.

09:30.570 --> 09:35.992
[whimpering, babbling]

09:36.701 --> 09:37.535
[gasps]

09:38.369 --> 09:39.245
Uh... uh...

09:39.370 --> 09:40.413
Clover?

09:40.496 --> 09:43.124
[babbling unintelligibly]

09:43.207 --> 09:46.043
Why is she doing that?
It's freakin' me out, man.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.671
Masikura, tongue that crazy brain.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.214
Find out what's going on in there.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.719
I gots to know! I gots to know!

09:56.762 --> 09:58.806
What is happening?

09:58.931 --> 09:59.849
-[smack]
-[grunting]

09:59.932 --> 10:02.560
We seem to be at a back alley brawl.

10:02.643 --> 10:06.147
Duh. Obviously. But, why are we
holding hands, Masikura?

10:06.230 --> 10:08.774
Your skin's all dry and scaly. Ugh.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.985
-I'm a lizard.
-Yeah, that's not it.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.155
[Grandma Rose grunting, groans]

10:14.238 --> 10:15.489
[laughs]

10:15.615 --> 10:18.075
-[groaning]
-[growls]

10:18.159 --> 10:20.369
[screams, laughs maniacally]

10:20.453 --> 10:21.287
Grandma Rose!

10:21.454 --> 10:23.289
[laughs]

10:23.372 --> 10:25.958
[Clover screaming]

10:26.042 --> 10:27.251
[thud]

10:28.044 --> 10:29.045
[Julien grunts, groans]

10:29.170 --> 10:30.296
Are you kidding me?

10:30.379 --> 10:34.383
That nasty looking cow-thingie
killed Clover's grandmother?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.801
No wonder she's all...

10:35.885 --> 10:37.053
[imitating Clover]

10:37.178 --> 10:39.680
There's no way she can fight like that,
Your Majesty.

10:39.847 --> 10:43.434
We'll just have to pull her out of this
contest thingie. Easy-peasy.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.769
[babbling]

10:44.852 --> 10:48.272
It's perfectly within the rules
for Clover to forfeit.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.315
Great! Yeah!

10:49.398 --> 10:51.734
And, when she forfeits,
she goes into the forfeiting pit.

10:51.817 --> 10:52.902
[chuckles]

10:52.985 --> 10:55.321
It's a bottomless pit of certain doom.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.031
Oh, there go some forfeiters now.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.492
[all groaning]

10:59.575 --> 11:01.077
[screaming]

11:01.369 --> 11:02.828
[coughs]

11:02.953 --> 11:05.164
-Mm-hmm. [screams in fear]
-[screams in fear]

11:05.247 --> 11:07.166
They didn't even say goodbye.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.127
[Clover babbling unintelligibly]

11:10.211 --> 11:13.172
I can't believe this is how
it's going to end.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.801
We can't forfeit or she goes
into the bottomless pit. [exclaims]

11:16.884 --> 11:20.137
And we can't fight because,
I mean, look at her.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.182
-[groans]
-Uh-huh. [laughs]

11:23.265 --> 11:24.683
-Nice one, Clover.
-Huh?

11:24.767 --> 11:28.312
She can't hear you.
She's just mindlessly throwing punches.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.523
She's broken. We broke her.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.317
Don't you say that, Maurice.
Bite your tongue.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.778
She's in there. I know it.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.030
-Smack him again, Clo-Clo. Come on.
-[grunts]

11:38.114 --> 11:39.573
[babbling]

11:39.657 --> 11:42.785
No, stop it. Her mindless eyes
are giving me the heebie-jeebies.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.869
[continues babbling]

11:43.953 --> 11:46.205
-Stop!
-Not a chance, Mo-Mo,

11:46.288 --> 11:49.250
because I feel a crazy thinks coming on.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.292
Here it comes.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.335
Oh, yeah!

11:54.588 --> 11:58.300
Between my corn-grinding,
super-fresh booty action

11:58.384 --> 12:01.679
and Clover's brain-dead punching,
we can do this!

12:01.762 --> 12:04.974
I will save Clover's life.
Get me some rope.

12:05.057 --> 12:08.018
Rope? What's the rope for, King Julien?

12:08.102 --> 12:10.855
Mort? I thought you were dead.
Or dead-ish.

12:10.938 --> 12:15.443
I'm part starfish. I heal fast.
I grew my own head back once.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.486
-[whimpering] Oh, yeah.
-Okay, uh...

12:17.570 --> 12:21.824
I need rope, Mort,
because our Clover is a twin.

12:21.907 --> 12:22.741
[laughs]

12:22.825 --> 12:24.452
Well, I... I...

12:24.535 --> 12:26.078
I don't know.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.998
She is a twin, sir. Everybody knows that.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.834
And I am her other twin.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.712
Our name is King Julien Clover Twinsies.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.047
-See? We're conjoined.
-[babbles]

12:37.131 --> 12:38.257
[laughs nervously]

12:38.340 --> 12:40.885
We used to be attached
at the belly button, like all twins,

12:40.968 --> 12:41.844
but it, uh...

12:41.927 --> 12:45.764
shifted, you know, gravity,
too many birthdays, that old chestnut.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.392
[laughs nervously] You...
You know what I... You know...

12:48.476 --> 12:52.605
Ugh. All very irregular.
One second, please.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.273
[whispers] What do you think, sir?

12:54.356 --> 12:55.649
[rattling, hissing]

12:55.733 --> 12:56.942
If you say so.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.571
[clears throat] You may fight
as conjoined twins.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.489
[sighs in relief]

13:01.614 --> 13:02.448
[humming]

13:02.531 --> 13:03.782
I don't like this.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.410
Something's not right
with that mysterious patron.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.412
[hissing, rattling]

13:09.413 --> 13:11.457
-[Clover babbling]
-Ah! Ah!

13:12.917 --> 13:15.002
[grunting]

13:15.085 --> 13:16.045
She's too stiff.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.214
Probably because she's in a coma. [groans]

13:18.672 --> 13:19.590
[laughs]

13:19.673 --> 13:22.176
Maurice got punched in the face. [groans]

13:22.968 --> 13:24.303
Hurray!

13:24.386 --> 13:26.347
I got punched in the face!

13:26.430 --> 13:27.681
-[Mort giggling]
-[laughs]

13:27.765 --> 13:30.017
-Check it. I so got this!
-Uh! Uh!

13:30.100 --> 13:33.938
Uh, Your Majesty.
You and your twinsie are up next.

-[groans]
-[growls]

13:38.484 --> 13:39.401
[laughs]

13:41.862 --> 13:46.617
Ach, joy-boy, try to keep that one alive
long enough for me to destroy her,

13:46.700 --> 13:49.828
-just like I did her grandmutter.
-[crowd cheering]

13:49.912 --> 13:51.080

14:06.345 --> 14:08.597
Not good, not working.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.183
Aah! And creepy.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.602
Oi! Ow!

14:14.061 --> 14:17.982

King Julien Clover Twinsies win!

14:31.787 --> 14:33.414
Congtratula-- Hey!

14:33.497 --> 14:37.585
We got lucky, but look at her.
She's useless.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.296
Where is the... Clover!

14:40.379 --> 14:42.339
I thought if I just poked her
with this stick,

14:42.423 --> 14:44.842
I could make her punch people
and we could win.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.428
I'll punch people for you, King Julien.

14:47.511 --> 14:51.974
And you don't have to poke me
with a stick, unless you want to.

14:52.057 --> 14:52.975
Ow!

14:53.058 --> 14:56.645
Oh. Message for you, my king. [groans]

14:57.897 --> 15:00.858
-[grunts in pain]
-"This mix tape might help." Huh.

15:00.941 --> 15:05.321
Wonder what that means.
Oh, well, a mix tape is a mix tape.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.531
Maurice, boombox me forthwith!

15:07.823 --> 15:08.866

16:20.771 --> 16:23.816
And Wigman Wildebeest!

16:23.899 --> 16:26.902
That's Vigman. The "W" sounds like a "V".

16:26.986 --> 16:28.988
So, Vigman Vildebeest?

16:29.238 --> 16:31.573
Nein!  Vigman Wildebeest...

16:31.657 --> 16:35.536
Uh, I'm so confused.
Is it a "V" or a "W"? Uh...

16:35.619 --> 16:37.830
I believe it's both, sir.

Huh? Hmm.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.220
Hmm... mmm...

16:54.138 --> 16:57.766
Now, let's see who's really behind
this crazy tournament.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.101
[gasps]

16:59.184 --> 17:00.394
Uncle King Julien?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.272
[laughs]

17:03.355 --> 17:05.482
Oh, yes, it is! Cha-cha-cha!

17:05.566 --> 17:09.403
It's all me. I fooled everyone
with my sexy snake dance

17:09.486 --> 17:12.489
-and my talented use of the maracas.
-[maracas rattling]

17:12.573 --> 17:14.366
King Julien, it's your-- [groans]

17:14.450 --> 17:18.078
Speak up, Maurice. I don't know who
[imitates groaning sound] is.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.830
Wait, is that my uncle?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.165
That's right, nephew.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.125
-[Maurice screams]
-This was all part of my plan.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.711
Except I only wanted to destroy Clover.

17:25.794 --> 17:30.966
She's been a constant thorn in my side
every time I try to take the throne back.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.803
And now you've made this
a win-win for me, nephew.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.722
I will eliminate you both.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.224
No one will stand in my way.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.853
Just as soon as this cage match
comes to a close.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.482
-[growls]
-[crowd cheers loudly]

17:47.232 --> 17:48.901
I don't know.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.694
A cage match sounds so...

17:50.778 --> 17:53.197
-so terribly violent.
-Are you joking with me?

17:53.781 --> 17:56.200
What do you think a fight
to the death is all about?

17:56.283 --> 17:59.244
You crocodiles are a bunch
of scaly crybabies.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.955
Ha... How could you say
something like that?

18:02.039 --> 18:04.750
Oh! I... I feel faint...

18:04.833 --> 18:07.628
-[groans]
-Oh, sir, I've got you.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.048
Vigman Wildebeest! Destroy them!

18:11.173 --> 18:12.007
Umm.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.259
Some days work is just work.

18:14.343 --> 18:19.765
But, today, it is going to be
a real pleasure destroying you both!

18:19.848 --> 18:21.725
Mort! Hit the music!

18:21.975 --> 18:24.728
Sorry. Having a little
technical difficulty.

-[tape-recorder whirring]
-[exclaiming, screaming]

18:26.855 --> 18:29.024
Not good. That tape was our only hope.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.359
We are so dead.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.485
Oh,  ja, ja.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.113
That is exactly what you are. [laughs]

18:35.447 --> 18:37.366
[screams in fear, groans]

18:38.617 --> 18:41.036
Who is the best? Who is the beast?

18:41.120 --> 18:45.082
Vigman! Vigman!
[vocalizing] Vigman! [grunts]

18:47.167 --> 18:48.961
-Hello, Clover.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.879
-I'm Pineapple.
-Uh?

18:50.963 --> 18:53.173
I've brought you up here
because, quite frankly,

18:53.257 --> 18:55.551
I've bet a lot of money on your fight.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.469
Where's... What's happening?

18:57.553 --> 19:01.265
There's someone here
I think you need to talk to.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.267
Baby Brawler.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.184
Grandma Rose?!

19:05.769 --> 19:08.689
Now, there's a good girl.
Tell your Rosie what's what.

19:08.772 --> 19:09.731
I... [sobbing]

19:09.815 --> 19:13.277
When I saw that wildebeest,
it brought back all those memories.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.821
All the pain of that day
when I lost you forever.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.490
Pshaw. You never lost me.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.242
I've always been right here,

19:20.325 --> 19:21.827
-watching over you.
-Hmm.

19:21.910 --> 19:25.873
Listen, love, no one lives forever.
We all gotta go sometime.

19:26.123 --> 19:30.335
I got no regrets. I went out fighting!
I went out with me boots on.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.797
-But, you don't wear boots.
-[chuckles] Oi! No back-sass.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.424
Can we hurry this along?

19:35.507 --> 19:38.427
There are two very ripe zucchinis
threatening to pulp me

19:38.510 --> 19:41.221
if I lose this, uh... bet.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.807
You will always be my Baby Brawler

19:43.932 --> 19:47.603
and I will always be right here,
in your heart.

19:47.686 --> 19:51.440
Now, you get back down there
and you stand up for yourself.

19:51.732 --> 19:52.858
Get up, Clover!

19:57.362 --> 19:58.572
[Grandma Rose]  Get up, Clover.

19:58.655 --> 20:03.493
Now, I finish this,
just like I finished her grandmutter.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.580
[laughs maniacally]

20:06.830 --> 20:10.459
[growls in anger]

20:11.043 --> 20:12.377
-[Grandma Rose]  Get up!
-[exclaims]

20:12.461 --> 20:13.921
[groans]

20:14.713 --> 20:15.714
[Clover] Oi!

20:15.839 --> 20:19.092
-Wigman, I've got a message for you.
-That's Vigman!

20:19.176 --> 20:20.928
That's part of the message.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.180
It's from my Grandma Rose. [cracks neck]

20:23.263 --> 20:25.933
Two words.
[shouts] Shut your bleedin' gob!

20:26.016 --> 20:27.768
[counting in German]

20:27.851 --> 20:30.187
-That's four words--
-Hi-ya!

20:30.270 --> 20:31.688
-[groans]
-[grunts]

20:32.064 --> 20:33.065
[both grunting]

20:33.690 --> 20:34.942
[groaning]

20:35.025 --> 20:37.694
-[smacking]
-Eh...

20:39.613 --> 20:40.530
[groaning]

20:41.949 --> 20:43.492
-Hi-yah!
-Aah!

20:43.575 --> 20:45.035
[all gasp in disbelief]

20:46.536 --> 20:47.788
[all cheering]

20:52.876 --> 20:54.336
That was for you, Grandma Rose.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.298
-Winner! King Julien Clover Twinsies!
-[gong sounds]

20:58.423 --> 21:01.260
-Wait, what?
-Long story, Clo-Clo!

21:01.385 --> 21:02.344
[laughs]

21:02.594 --> 21:06.556
[grunting]

21:08.642 --> 21:10.811
[screaming]  Nein!

21:11.478 --> 21:13.814
What kind of pickled pimento loaf is that?

21:13.897 --> 21:16.942
That should have worked.
How does this keep happening to me?

21:17.025 --> 21:19.278
I really need to get a better
mystical advisor.

21:19.778 --> 21:23.240
Win some. Lose some. [farts]

21:23.323 --> 21:24.157
Not sorry.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.286
Okay, you oversized shoes.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.454
Will you finish Clover off
for me at least?

21:29.538 --> 21:31.123
No, never!

21:31.206 --> 21:36.169
You called us crybabies. That was hurtful.
So very hurtful. I-- [stammers] I just...

21:36.253 --> 21:38.171
All right, everyone, we're going home.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.050
This whole tournament
was such a huge disappointment.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.885
[sobbing]

21:44.011 --> 21:46.430
Time for me to be skedaddling, too,
I'm thinking.

21:46.555 --> 21:50.058
[groans] Oh! Whoa! Ugh!

21:50.142 --> 21:51.351
Oh!

21:51.435 --> 21:54.021
[screams] Oh, no!

21:54.646 --> 21:58.233
I got all the pieces of my tail
out of the tape, mostly.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.569
My old mix tape! Where'd you get this?

22:00.652 --> 22:03.613
Hey, sis. Saw you had
the brain-lock thing.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.867
And I just, you know, thought that
the tape might help or whatever.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.702
Crimson, but why?

22:08.785 --> 22:11.580
You and I, you know,
we have our problems. Um...

22:11.663 --> 22:14.583
But, she was my grandmother, too.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.625
I wanted you to win.

22:15.709 --> 22:19.921
Wait up. You two have
the same grandmother?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.423
Clover, did you know about this?

22:21.506 --> 22:23.800
Yes, King Julien. She's my sister.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.470
You did good, Clo-Clo. You did good.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.472
-Had a little help.
-Huh?

22:29.056 --> 22:30.515
Place your bets.

22:30.682 --> 22:31.600
[growling]

22:31.808 --> 22:35.312
I been waiting for this one
a long time, Wigman.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.189
You're going down.
