00:29.520 --> 00:31.480
<i>It's morning in the forest.</i>

00:32.520 --> 00:35.120
<i>And for this troop of chimpanzees,</i>

00:35.200 --> 00:37.040
<i>it's time to get out of bed</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:38.960
<i>and get on with the day.</i>

00:45.960 --> 00:49.640
<i>But when you sleep</i>
<i>in a nest 40 meters up in the air,</i>

00:51.080 --> 00:53.320
<i>it can be a bit of a challenge.</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:17.120
<i> This morning ritual</i>
<i>has been playing out like clockwork</i>

01:18.560 --> 01:20.320
<i>for countless generations.</i>

01:25.680 --> 01:30.240
<i>A rhythm driven by one of the most</i>
<i>mysterious properties of our universe.</i>

01:38.160 --> 01:39.000
<i>Time.</i>

01:41.920 --> 01:45.080
<i>And time is playing</i>
<i>an extra important role</i>

01:45.160 --> 01:46.800
<i>for one female chimp.</i>

01:49.320 --> 01:51.120
<i>Celeste is in her mid-30s,</i>

01:52.720 --> 01:55.040
<i>and she has a ticking clock inside her.</i>

01:59.840 --> 02:03.840
<i>A clock that was set</i>
<i>13.8 billion years ago.</i>

02:14.720 --> 02:16.800
<i>From The Big Bang came atoms…</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:21.000
…<i>and energy…</i>

02:22.440 --> 02:25.800
<i>…which have journeyed across</i>
<i>vast reaches of space.</i>

02:31.280 --> 02:32.760
<i>And these ingredients</i>

02:34.040 --> 02:35.720
<i>are now assembling…</i>

02:38.520 --> 02:40.720
<i>to create a new life.</i>

02:44.600 --> 02:48.760
<i>In Celeste's womb,</i>
<i>a tiny chimpanzee is forming.</i>

02:52.960 --> 02:57.320
<i>It will be another 150 days</i>
<i>before this baby meets the world.</i>

02:59.960 --> 03:01.440
<i>That's the time it takes.</i>

03:04.320 --> 03:06.120
<i>And without time,</i>

03:06.200 --> 03:09.440
<i>nothing in our universe</i>
<i>would ever be born.</i>

03:12.720 --> 03:14.920
<i>From the youngest chimpanzee…</i>

03:16.920 --> 03:18.800
<i>to the oldest black hole.</i>

03:23.680 --> 03:27.280
<i>But how did time start in the first place?</i>

03:29.240 --> 03:32.480
<i>Does everything experience time</i>
<i>in the same way?</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:38.440
<i>And will our universe's clock</i>
<i>ever stop ticking?</i>

04:09.440 --> 04:12.960
<i> The day begins for a chimp</i>
<i>much as it does for us.</i>

04:16.280 --> 04:17.200
<i>Breakfast.</i>

04:23.680 --> 04:27.360
<i>A critical meal…</i>
<i>when you're eating for two.</i>

04:35.800 --> 04:38.760
<i>Celeste is already an experienced mom.</i>

04:42.120 --> 04:46.560
<i>Her firstborn, Apollo,</i>
<i>is the dominant male of the troop.</i>

04:48.800 --> 04:51.960
<i>And he can be a bit slow</i>
<i>to get going in the morning.</i>

04:59.120 --> 05:01.760
<i>Each chimp is a different age.</i>

05:04.640 --> 05:06.960
<i>Each has a distinct personality.</i>

05:09.720 --> 05:13.120
<i>But all of them are creatures of routine.</i>

05:17.520 --> 05:21.920
<i>Their lives governed</i>
<i>by the passage of time.</i>

05:24.520 --> 05:25.840
<i>We can't see it.</i>

05:26.840 --> 05:29.040
-<i>Or hear it.</i>

05:29.840 --> 05:32.720
-<i>We can't influence it in any way.</i>

05:34.240 --> 05:39.480
<i>And yet, every heartbeat,</i>
<i>every choice and action,</i>

05:39.560 --> 05:45.800
<i>every inaction is a consequence</i>
<i>of time's continuous flow.</i>

05:47.240 --> 05:50.400
<i>It can whiz by or drag on.</i>

05:51.480 --> 05:54.040
<i>But time ticks ever onward.</i>

05:55.320 --> 06:00.920
<i>Stars and planets form, age, and die.</i>

06:02.440 --> 06:05.400
<i>In their wake, new stars emerge.</i>

06:05.480 --> 06:07.720
<i>And from a rare few,</i>

06:07.800 --> 06:11.600
<i>the most mysterious objects</i>
<i>in the universe are born.</i>

06:13.120 --> 06:14.320
<i>Black holes.</i>

06:22.040 --> 06:24.840
<i>Time is the cosmic conductor.</i>

06:27.600 --> 06:30.520
<i>Nothing can escape its grasp.</i>

06:44.680 --> 06:49.240
<i>Although we have devices</i>
<i>that can track and measure time…</i>

06:54.920 --> 06:55.800
…<i>chimps don't.</i>

07:04.280 --> 07:07.800
<i>Celeste and her family</i>
<i>use the sun as their guide.</i>

07:11.800 --> 07:14.760
<i>Rising and arcing across the sky.</i>

07:19.120 --> 07:20.040
<i>As it moves…</i>

07:23.200 --> 07:24.080
<i>so do they.</i>

07:31.960 --> 07:35.080
<i>Chimps rarely sleep</i>
<i>in the same nest twice.</i>

07:35.960 --> 07:39.040
<i>Each morning,</i>
<i>they head off in search of fresh fruit.</i>

07:41.640 --> 07:45.280
<i>Journeying from one part</i>
<i>of their territory to another.</i>

07:49.120 --> 07:52.320
<i>But right now, the ripest fruit…</i>

07:54.840 --> 07:57.640
<i>is on the other side of an open plain.</i>

08:02.480 --> 08:06.240
<i>Apollo and the strongest members</i>
<i>of the troop go ahead</i>

08:07.160 --> 08:09.480
<i>to make sure it's safe for the others.</i>

08:12.280 --> 08:13.440
<i>Out in the open,</i>

08:13.520 --> 08:17.240
<i>they're vulnerable</i>
<i>to predators, rival chimps,</i>

08:18.160 --> 08:20.000
<i>and the heat of the rising sun.</i>

08:24.160 --> 08:25.560
<i>They need to be quick.</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:28.760
<i>Time is ticking.</i>

08:33.720 --> 08:36.920
<i>The sun traveling across the sky</i>

08:37.000 --> 08:39.600
<i>forms the chimps' basic unit of time.</i>

08:43.680 --> 08:47.440
<i>From sunrise to sunset</i>
<i>and back to sunrise.</i>

08:49.520 --> 08:51.000
<i>The 24-hour day.</i>

08:54.200 --> 08:57.400
<i>But a day</i>
<i>is not actually a measure of time at all.</i>

08:59.160 --> 09:02.200
<i>It's a measure of motion.</i>

09:08.640 --> 09:11.480
<i>As our planet rotates on its axis,</i>

09:11.560 --> 09:18.120
<i>the forest moves through space</i>
<i>at 1,600 kilometers per hour.</i>

09:20.360 --> 09:25.400
<i>It takes 24 hours</i>
<i>for Earth to do one full turn.</i>

09:28.280 --> 09:32.000
<i>Giving the chimps 24 hours of movement,</i>

09:33.120 --> 09:36.880
<i>12 in sunshine and 12 in darkness.</i>

09:38.560 --> 09:41.680
<i>Again and again.</i>

09:46.800 --> 09:52.080
<i>It's our planet's steady spin</i>
<i>that sets Earth's master clock.</i>

09:55.040 --> 09:58.200
<i>And is the chimps' trusted timekeeper.</i>

10:02.480 --> 10:05.080
<i>But this essential cycle</i>
<i>we take for granted…</i>

10:07.320 --> 10:08.840
<i>is not universal.</i>

10:15.840 --> 10:18.480
<i>As soon as you leave our home planet…</i>

10:20.280 --> 10:22.960
<i>…the 24-hour day no longer applies.</i>

10:27.960 --> 10:29.840
<i>Flying closest to the sun…</i>

10:32.080 --> 10:33.520
…<i>is the planet Mercury.</i>

10:35.160 --> 10:39.000
<i>Compared to us,</i>
<i>it rotates at a snail's pace.</i>

10:44.520 --> 10:49.760
<i>Our neighbor Venus spins even slower.</i>

10:51.400 --> 10:54.200
<i>It takes longer to rotate on its axis</i>

10:55.520 --> 10:57.760
<i>than it does to orbit the sun.</i>

11:00.920 --> 11:06.040
<i>Making Venus's day longer than its year.</i>

11:09.680 --> 11:12.640
<i>Each planet has its own unique day length.</i>

11:32.320 --> 11:36.040
<i>Including planets</i>
<i>far beyond our solar system.</i>

11:40.360 --> 11:42.440
<i>Sixty-three light years away,</i>

11:43.520 --> 11:45.280
<i>orbiting a young star,</i>

11:46.360 --> 11:48.640
<i>is Beta Pictoris b.</i>

11:52.520 --> 11:55.240
<i>It spins so fast…</i>

11:58.720 --> 12:01.000
<i>…it bulges out at the sides.</i>

12:04.720 --> 12:08.160
<i>It is the fastest-spinning world</i>
<i>we know of.</i>

12:10.200 --> 12:13.120
<i>Here, a day lasts just eight hours.</i>

12:18.480 --> 12:23.120
<i>Every planet in our universe spins</i>
<i>at its own speed.</i>

12:26.360 --> 12:27.760
<i>Billions of worlds,</i>

12:28.880 --> 12:30.440
<i>each with their own clock,</i>

12:31.760 --> 12:33.800
<i>ticking away to different rhythms.</i>

12:35.360 --> 12:40.880
<i>But all moving forward</i>
<i>on a universal cosmic timeline.</i>

12:58.560 --> 12:59.640
<i>Back on Earth,</i>

13:00.640 --> 13:03.120
<i>with the sun now almost directly overhead,</i>

13:05.080 --> 13:07.560
<i>the chimps know exactly what time it is.</i>

13:17.160 --> 13:18.360
<i>It's lunchtime.</i>

13:31.160 --> 13:35.760
<i>And their crossing of the savanna</i>
<i>has been timed to perfection.</i>

13:42.680 --> 13:44.400
<i>They've hit the jackpot.</i>

13:51.760 --> 13:54.680
<i>These sweet berries</i>
<i>of the African grape tree</i>

13:56.400 --> 13:58.560
<i>are only around for a few weeks.</i>

14:05.080 --> 14:08.600
<i>A rare seasonal gift from the forest.</i>

14:12.680 --> 14:16.280
<i>Where the middle of the day</i>
<i>is a very productive time.</i>

14:20.840 --> 14:24.640
<i>Animals of all sizes</i>
<i>are tending to their daily tasks.</i>

14:30.000 --> 14:32.880
<i>And each experiences time differently.</i>

14:37.120 --> 14:40.800
<i>For small creatures</i>
<i>that live fast, short lives…</i>

14:45.600 --> 14:48.960
<i>…lunchtime can feel like a lifetime.</i>

14:54.680 --> 14:57.440
<i>For slower, longer living things,</i>

14:58.120 --> 15:01.280
<i>an hour can go by in the blink of an eye.</i>

15:08.320 --> 15:11.360
<i>But whether you're living in high speed</i>

15:12.360 --> 15:14.120
<i>or in slow motion,</i>

15:15.960 --> 15:21.000
<i>all life in the forest must adhere</i>
<i>to the same 24-hour day.</i>

15:23.720 --> 15:25.920
<i>And as the world keeps spinning…</i>

15:29.400 --> 15:31.560
<i>…those days keep ticking by…</i>

15:33.600 --> 15:37.720
<i>dictating the lives of every chimpanzee.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:42.760
<i>One in particular.</i>

15:49.960 --> 15:51.920
<i>At just 15 weeks,</i>

15:52.880 --> 15:56.960
<i>this baby's entire body</i>
<i>could fit in its mother's hand.</i>

16:00.560 --> 16:02.440
<i>For it to fully form,</i>

16:02.520 --> 16:05.760
<i>a cascade</i>
<i>of perfectly timed events must occur.</i>

16:08.160 --> 16:10.360
<i>For the next 130 days,</i>

16:11.120 --> 16:15.480
<i>every minute,</i>
<i>every nanosecond is critical.</i>

16:24.200 --> 16:30.160
<i>New cells divide and grow</i>
<i>with remarkable speed and precision.</i>

16:34.200 --> 16:35.200
<i>Right now,</i>

16:36.160 --> 16:41.680
<i>brain cells are multiplying</i>
<i>at a rate of around 15 million per hour.</i>

16:51.760 --> 16:54.800
<i>All of us, from our very first moments,</i>

16:55.800 --> 17:00.160
<i>have a deep biological relationship</i>
<i>with time.</i>

17:17.360 --> 17:19.120
<i>As the sunlight wanes,</i>

17:21.760 --> 17:24.280
<i>the chimps instinctively switch gears.</i>

17:27.840 --> 17:29.080
<i>To evening mode.</i>

17:39.120 --> 17:41.920
<i>Nesting calls signal to the whole troop.</i>

17:44.400 --> 17:47.560
<i>It's time to find a safe place</i>
<i>to spend the night.</i>

18:01.400 --> 18:05.560
<i>Their bedding needs to be soft but strong.</i>

18:12.200 --> 18:14.640
<i>It doesn't hurt if it tastes good either.</i>

18:18.880 --> 18:21.800
<i>The rhythm of every day in the forest</i>

18:21.880 --> 18:25.360
<i>is determined by the sun's position</i>
<i>in the sky.</i>

18:34.560 --> 18:37.000
<i>But the chimp's innate sense of time</i>

18:38.200 --> 18:40.920
<i>comes from something inside them.</i>

18:49.680 --> 18:53.680
<i>Deep in their brains</i>
<i>is a biological clock.</i>

18:56.560 --> 18:59.520
<i>Bundles of neurons act as a pendulum…</i>

19:01.840 --> 19:06.400
<i>…controlled by genes</i>
<i>that switch on and off…</i>

19:08.520 --> 19:12.960
<i>and a cycle that repeats every 24 hours.</i>

19:16.240 --> 19:21.320
<i>These clock genes create</i>
<i>a circadian rhythm in the body</i>

19:22.080 --> 19:28.200
<i>that waxes and wanes in sync</i>
<i>with our planet's rotation.</i>

19:30.600 --> 19:32.040
<i>Controlling hormones…</i>

19:36.520 --> 19:37.440
…<i>heart rates,</i>

19:38.800 --> 19:40.640
<i>and energy levels.</i>

19:46.200 --> 19:50.760
<i>And right now, the chimps' body clocks</i>
<i>are sending the message,</i>

19:52.160 --> 19:54.720
<i>"It's time to get sleepy."</i>

19:57.960 --> 19:59.560
<i>Not everyone can though.</i>

20:14.320 --> 20:17.240
<i>Celeste's baby's brain is still forming.</i>

20:20.640 --> 20:23.000
<i>With no internal clock of its own,</i>

20:23.640 --> 20:27.240
<i>it relies on its mother's hormones</i>
<i>to keep it synchronized.</i>

20:29.600 --> 20:33.360
<i>But baby doesn't always get the memo.</i>

20:37.480 --> 20:39.120
<i>Lucky for Celeste,</i>

20:39.200 --> 20:41.560
<i>with so much growing to do,</i>

20:41.640 --> 20:44.520
<i>her baby does eventually drift off.</i>

20:59.600 --> 21:03.520
<i>While the chimps go to sleep</i>
<i>high in the treetops…</i>

21:07.280 --> 21:10.680
<i>other forest dwellers are just waking up.</i>

21:22.720 --> 21:25.400
<i>Body clocks tick away</i>

21:25.480 --> 21:29.760
<i>in the cells of plants and animals</i>
<i>throughout the forest.</i>

21:38.320 --> 21:43.520
<i>Clock genes evolved</i>
<i>two and a half billion years ago</i>

21:43.600 --> 21:45.600
<i>in the first living cells.</i>

21:48.080 --> 21:52.880
<i>Those that could anticipate the light</i>
<i>and dark of a day had an advantage.</i>

21:56.160 --> 21:57.920
<i>And as life evolved,</i>

21:59.240 --> 22:01.840
<i>it synchronized to Earth's motion.</i>

22:02.880 --> 22:04.680
<i>So that today,</i>

22:04.760 --> 22:09.400
<i>these clocks exist</i>
<i>in almost every creature on Earth.</i>

22:13.640 --> 22:16.440
<i>Although some creatures prefer day</i>
<i>and others night…</i>

22:22.320 --> 22:26.200
<i>all life is dancing to the same beat.</i>

22:28.720 --> 22:30.960
<i>Thanks to cellular clocks</i>

22:31.040 --> 22:36.240
<i>that tick in time</i>
<i>with the spin of our Earth.</i>

22:53.000 --> 22:55.520
<i>As yesterday becomes a memory…</i>

22:58.040 --> 23:00.440
<i>…another new day begins in the forest.</i>

23:09.560 --> 23:11.000
<i>A fresh cycle,</i>

23:12.760 --> 23:17.160
<i>and yet, no clock can ever truly be reset.</i>

23:24.720 --> 23:29.240
<i>And there are subtle clues</i>
<i>all around the forest that reveal why.</i>

23:32.440 --> 23:38.040
<i>Nothing is the same today</i>
<i>as it was yesterday.</i>

23:42.200 --> 23:44.640
<i>Least of all Apollo,</i>

23:45.720 --> 23:49.160
<i>who seems to have woken up</i>
<i>on the wrong side of the bed.</i>

23:57.600 --> 23:59.320
<i>When he's in a bad mood…</i>

24:03.200 --> 24:07.840
<i>the rest of the group</i>
<i>just need to keep their heads down.</i>

24:26.720 --> 24:29.560
<i>He soon finds a target</i>
<i>for his rage, though.</i>

24:40.680 --> 24:44.120
<i>Some of the younger chimps</i>
<i>have found honey for breakfast.</i>

24:56.680 --> 25:00.240
<i>And they forgot</i>
<i>to invite Apollo to join them.</i>

25:14.640 --> 25:19.080
<i>You soon learn, never get</i>
<i>on the wrong side of the dominant male.</i>

25:26.880 --> 25:28.400
<i>He's got a nasty bite.</i>

25:32.280 --> 25:34.800
<i>Thankfully, it's not too serious.</i>

25:43.200 --> 25:46.440
<i>With a bit of care,</i>
<i>this wound should heal.</i>

25:49.360 --> 25:53.040
<i>But wounds leave behind scars</i>,

25:54.160 --> 25:56.120
<i>etched into the chimps' bodies.</i>

25:57.400 --> 26:03.520
<i>Indelible marks of the past that reveal</i>
<i>the one universal truth about time.</i>

26:07.280 --> 26:08.560
<i>It has a direction.</i>

26:10.640 --> 26:13.000
<i>You can never go back in time…</i>

26:14.640 --> 26:17.320
<i>…only forward into the future.</i>

26:20.800 --> 26:22.920
<i>This is time's arrow,</i>

26:24.200 --> 26:27.840
<i>and it leaves scars on everything</i>

26:28.520 --> 26:29.480
<i>across Earth…</i>

26:31.240 --> 26:32.400
…<i>and beyond.</i>

26:41.160 --> 26:46.520
<i>Our moon is pockmarked with battle scars</i>
<i>that tell stories of ancient events.</i>

26:56.480 --> 26:57.840
<i>So too are the planets.</i>

27:01.680 --> 27:08.640
<i>Their surfaces testament to a lifetime</i>
<i>of bombardment by asteroids and comets.</i>

27:15.040 --> 27:19.120
<i>But perhaps the most impressive</i>
<i>impact crater in our solar system</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:23.080
<i>belongs to a moon of Saturn.</i>

27:24.480 --> 27:25.480
<i>Mimas.</i>

27:27.880 --> 27:32.560
<i>The Herschel crater</i>
<i>is 130 kilometers across.</i>

27:38.280 --> 27:40.840
<i>Whatever created this enormous scar…</i>

27:43.000 --> 27:46.280
<i>must have come close</i>
<i>to shattering the moon to pieces.</i>

28:04.000 --> 28:06.080
<i>Mimas lives to tell the tale.</i>

28:07.840 --> 28:10.400
<i>But events like this are irreversible.</i>

28:15.320 --> 28:19.360
<i>And they differentiate the past</i>
<i>from the present.</i>

28:22.160 --> 28:24.600
<i>Impact craters are timestamps</i>

28:26.360 --> 28:28.840
<i>that mark a unique moment in history.</i>

28:37.400 --> 28:40.360
<i>We can never revisit the moment</i>
<i>they were created.</i>

28:43.960 --> 28:47.640
<i>But we can piece together traces</i>
<i>of past events</i>

28:49.080 --> 28:51.480
<i>and map a course back through time.</i>

28:56.640 --> 28:57.880
<i>Before craters.</i>

28:59.640 --> 29:00.920
<i>Before planets.</i>

29:01.840 --> 29:03.080
<i>Before stars.</i>

29:05.000 --> 29:07.680
<i>Back to a time before time.</i>

29:14.400 --> 29:17.400
<i>Our universe had a beginning.</i>

29:21.840 --> 29:24.960
<i>A very big bang…</i>

29:27.360 --> 29:29.800
<i>that created three-dimensional space</i>

29:31.280 --> 29:32.560
<i>and time.</i>

29:36.880 --> 29:40.240
<i>But space and time are not separate.</i>

29:41.800 --> 29:44.840
<i>Time is woven</i>
<i>into the fabric of the universe.</i>

29:49.240 --> 29:54.120
<i>Bound to space</i>
<i>as our universe's fourth dimension.</i>

29:56.480 --> 29:59.400
<i>The Big Bang</i>
<i>set the universe's clock ticking.</i>

30:02.920 --> 30:05.280
<i>Propelling everything into the future.</i>

30:09.040 --> 30:13.040
<i>It created the arrow of time.</i>

30:18.640 --> 30:21.960
<i>From our universe's very first moments…</i>

30:32.360 --> 30:34.640
<i>…it pushes us all into the future,</i>

30:35.720 --> 30:38.200
<i>causing everything to grow,</i>

30:39.640 --> 30:40.480
<i>age…</i>

30:42.440 --> 30:43.400
<i>…and change.</i>

30:45.560 --> 30:47.000
<i>From childhood…</i>

30:48.000 --> 30:49.120
<i>…to adulthood,</i>

30:50.400 --> 30:54.080
<i>we all travel through life</i>
<i>in the same direction.</i>

30:55.640 --> 30:58.320
<i>Getting older day by day.</i>

30:59.960 --> 31:02.800
<i>And with age comes wisdom</i>

31:04.200 --> 31:07.640
<i>as youthful innocence</i>
<i>is replaced by experience.</i>

31:13.120 --> 31:17.520
<i>Time's arrow leads us through</i>
<i>these stages of life.</i>

31:21.880 --> 31:23.080
<i>It shapes us.</i>

31:25.760 --> 31:27.440
<i>Defines who we are.</i>

31:31.000 --> 31:32.520
<i>From our first moments…</i>

31:34.680 --> 31:35.800
<i>to our last.</i>

31:41.880 --> 31:44.480
<i>Chimps rarely live past the age of 40.</i>

31:49.200 --> 31:50.840
<i>Nothing is immortal.</i>

31:58.480 --> 32:03.240
<i>Everything that exists in our universe</i>
<i>has a finite lifespan.</i>

32:08.680 --> 32:11.960
<i>Including, perhaps, the universe itself.</i>

32:19.600 --> 32:23.440
<i>Today, the galaxies are filled with stars.</i>

32:27.280 --> 32:33.600
<i>But 95% of stars that will ever exist</i>
<i>have already been born.</i>

32:38.800 --> 32:41.400
<i>So, as our universe</i>
<i>journeys into the future…</i>

32:42.800 --> 32:44.080
<i>…the stars…</i>

32:44.760 --> 32:47.800
<i>-…one by one, will blink out…</i>

32:50.320 --> 32:55.200
<i>…leaving the universe</i>
<i>to face an ever-darkening future,</i>

32:56.880 --> 32:58.680
<i>stretching out for trillions,</i>

32:59.400 --> 33:02.920
<i>that's thousands of billions, of years.</i>

33:09.400 --> 33:11.640
<i>The age of starlight</i>

33:11.720 --> 33:16.280
<i>will be followed by a dark age</i>
<i>of black holes.</i>

33:22.920 --> 33:27.840
<i>These monsters feed on the remnants</i>
<i>of dead stars and planets.</i>

33:29.560 --> 33:31.040
<i>And as they do,</i>

33:31.120 --> 33:36.320
<i>their ever-increasing gravity scars</i>
<i>the very fabric of the universe.</i>

33:43.080 --> 33:46.400
<i>Distorting both space and time.</i>

33:48.760 --> 33:53.080
<i>The edge of a black hole,</i>
<i>called the event horizon,</i>

33:54.240 --> 33:57.400
<i>is a region where gravity</i>
<i>has become so strong</i>

33:58.240 --> 34:03.880
<i>it causes time</i>
<i>to slow down practically to a standstill.</i>

34:08.960 --> 34:12.280
<i>But even black holes</i>
<i>can't escape time's arrow.</i>

34:15.040 --> 34:16.920
<i>In the far, far future…</i>

34:21.080 --> 34:24.360
<i>…when there are no stars</i>
<i>or planets left to consume,</i>

34:25.920 --> 34:27.600
<i>they will begin to starve.</i>

34:32.800 --> 34:34.000
<i>And slowly…</i>

34:36.680 --> 34:37.920
<i>very slowly,</i>

34:39.720 --> 34:40.840
<i>they will shrink.</i>

34:46.360 --> 34:48.000
<i>When they die,</i>

34:48.080 --> 34:50.400
<i>no one truly knows what comes next.</i>

34:52.920 --> 34:57.960
<i>But it could be the end of our universe.</i>

35:07.400 --> 35:11.760
<i>Here on Earth, none of us can slow</i>
<i>the passage of time.</i>

35:16.000 --> 35:20.280
<i>And one of Celeste's aunts</i>
<i>is reaching the end of her time.</i>

35:24.280 --> 35:28.040
<i>Retreating from the group,</i>
<i>she heads into the forest alone.</i>

35:35.800 --> 35:37.840
<i>She has lived many years.</i>

35:41.200 --> 35:44.080
<i>But this day will be her last.</i>

36:03.760 --> 36:06.520
<i>While the world continues to spin,</i>

36:07.920 --> 36:11.040
<i>her body lies still.</i>

36:23.320 --> 36:26.160
<i>But time doesn't just carry us</i>
<i>toward endings.</i>

36:30.360 --> 36:32.400
<i>It also creates beginnings.</i>

36:37.280 --> 36:40.760
<i>As days turn into weeks</i>
<i>and weeks into months,</i>

36:42.560 --> 36:45.600
<i>there are big changes</i>
<i>for one special chimpanzee.</i>

36:59.600 --> 37:01.480
<i>Say hello to Cosmo.</i>

37:06.040 --> 37:08.960
<i>Her brain and limbs are now fully formed.</i>

37:10.720 --> 37:13.400
<i>And her eyes are ready to see the world.</i>

37:21.880 --> 37:24.960
<i>The exact timing</i>
<i>of her birth is impossible to know.</i>

37:26.560 --> 37:29.400
<i>But she could be born any day now.</i>

37:36.000 --> 37:38.760
<i>She's been in the womb for eight months.</i>

37:40.240 --> 37:43.480
<i>But her journey began long, long ago.</i>

37:46.000 --> 37:50.600
<i>The elements that made her</i>
<i>came from dying stars.</i>

37:52.520 --> 37:58.320
<i>The water that flows through her body</i>
<i>came from distant worlds.</i>

38:00.400 --> 38:06.920
<i>The energy that powers her muscles</i>
<i>came from the heart of our sun.</i>

38:09.720 --> 38:13.040
<i>But it's that most mysterious ingredient,</i>

38:13.720 --> 38:18.200
<i>the one that started ticking</i>
<i>13.8 billion years ago…</i>

38:22.280 --> 38:26.800
<i>that has led all other ingredients</i>
<i>to this moment.</i>

38:30.120 --> 38:31.240
<i>In this place.</i>

38:33.960 --> 38:35.200
<i>On this planet.</i>

38:44.720 --> 38:47.920
<i>Another sunrise, another morning.</i>

38:53.240 --> 38:57.520
<i>And this one is extra special.</i>

39:08.120 --> 39:10.520
<i>Welcome to Earth, Cosmo.</i>

39:15.440 --> 39:18.680
<i>This precious moment</i>
<i>will never be repeated for Celeste.</i>

39:19.480 --> 39:22.760
<i>But Cosmo's journey has just begun.</i>

39:26.000 --> 39:28.280
<i>It will take around three months</i>

39:28.360 --> 39:32.040
<i>for her body clock to synchronize</i>
<i>to the rhythm of the planet,</i>

39:33.840 --> 39:36.400
<i>one year before she can truly communicate,</i>

39:38.080 --> 39:42.680
<i>and perhaps 15 years</i>
<i>until she is fully grown.</i>

39:45.760 --> 39:47.520
<i>So much lies ahead.</i>

39:56.320 --> 39:57.600
<i>Like Cosmo,</i>

39:58.320 --> 40:01.360
<i>our universe is still in its infancy</i>

40:02.400 --> 40:06.640
<i>at the beginning</i>
<i>of an unimaginably long lifespan.</i>

40:08.680 --> 40:11.920
<i>We are living in the age of starlight.</i>

40:14.200 --> 40:19.160
<i>A moment when time's arrow</i>
<i>has filled the universe with beauty…</i>

40:22.440 --> 40:23.400
<i>…and wonder.</i>

40:32.360 --> 40:34.520
<i>But it's a brief window of time</i>

40:35.440 --> 40:39.200
<i>that will never be repeated</i>
<i>in the history of our universe.</i>

40:45.320 --> 40:47.720
<i>No one can slow the passage of time,</i>

40:49.080 --> 40:50.160
<i>nor should we try.</i>

40:55.280 --> 40:56.920
<i>Because without time,</i>

40:58.120 --> 40:59.480
<i>there would be no now.</i>

41:06.720 --> 41:08.160
<i>No moment in the sun.</i>

41:17.200 --> 41:18.920
<i>No moments, period.</i>

41:24.600 --> 41:25.720
<i>Without time,</i>

41:27.760 --> 41:29.160
<i>there would be no life.</i>

41:41.320 --> 41:44.120
<i>Next in the story of our universe,</i>

41:45.800 --> 41:47.440
<i>Earth's seasons.</i>

41:48.960 --> 41:51.760
<i>Like a mother bear raising her cubs…</i>

41:53.120 --> 41:56.680
<i>…we all experience</i>
<i>our planet's yearly transformations.</i>

41:59.760 --> 42:02.280
<i>But what created Earth's seasons?</i>

42:05.760 --> 42:08.840
<i>How are they connected</i>
<i>to the formation of our moon?</i>

42:09.880 --> 42:15.680
<i>And why does only our planet</i>
<i>have conditions just right for life?</i>
