WEBVTT

04:16.991 --> 04:19.560
- Shawn, Vikram's here.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.529
- I told
you a million times, Dad,

04:21.629 --> 04:22.462
he goes by Vik.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.265
- He goes by Vik.

04:31.806 --> 04:33.306
- Vik, it came!

04:35.777 --> 04:37.044
- What'd you get?
- Um-

04:37.145 --> 04:40.313
- "Gamera 3"?
Oh, the subbed "Mononoke Hime"?

04:47.855 --> 04:48.990
What, what is that?

04:49.090 --> 04:50.758
- It's "Go!
Great Decisive Battle

04:50.858 --> 04:52.593
At the End of
the Century with Rainbows."

04:52.693 --> 04:53.895
- Rainbows?

04:53.995 --> 04:56.597
- Daisuke Ogata's forgotten
anime masterpiece.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.832
Lost in a warehouse fire,

04:57.932 --> 04:59.567
but rumored to survive
on the black market.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.635
You know, "Go."

05:00.735 --> 05:02.937
- No, I don't know "Go."

05:03.037 --> 05:04.437
- We have to
watch this with her.

05:04.539 --> 05:06.040
- You wanna show that to her?

05:06.140 --> 05:08.676
- Look, nobody in Japan, much
less Oklahoma, has seen this.

05:09.944 --> 05:11.311
Think about how
impressed she'll be

05:11.411 --> 05:13.514
that we know so
much about her country.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.448
- You do know
she's a girl, right, Shawn?

05:16.517 --> 05:17.618
- Yeah?

05:17.718 --> 05:18.619
What does that matter?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.690
- It matters.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.391
- It's so awesome
your family is hosting

05:24.491 --> 05:26.727
a Japanese exchange student.

05:26.828 --> 05:27.962
My dad would never do that.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.699
- Dude, why are you
always so down on your dad?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.634
He doesn't understand anything.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.637
He can't even tell
the difference between Japan
and China.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.638
- Well,
at least he's around.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.640
I haven't seen
my dad in a month.

05:51.152 --> 05:52.587
Are you sure
that's the right movie?

05:52.687 --> 05:54.121
- Well, yeah.
The title says "Iké."

05:54.222 --> 05:56.123
- Icky?
- Yeah, yeah, "ee-kay."

05:56.224 --> 05:57.758
The imperative for "Go."

05:57.859 --> 06:00.493
- I thought
"Iké Man" meant like, hot guy.

06:00.595 --> 06:01.929
- "Ikémen."
- Ooh.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.566
Oh,
that's, uh, my bad there.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.035
How do you say
"eat a dick" in Japanese?

06:11.706 --> 06:13.507
This guy.

06:13.608 --> 06:15.943
I heard your dad fixed
my shitter last night

06:16.043 --> 06:17.511
to pay the rent.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.048
- I heard your dad
used your trust fund

06:21.148 --> 06:23.517
to buy your mom new tits.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.753
- What did you just say?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.090
Huh?

06:34.195 --> 06:35.663
Watch yourselves, losers.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.801
- Come on.

06:42.036 --> 06:43.403
What's the point of doing karate
if you're not gonna use it?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.739
- I know, I know.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.174
- The Bible is
like a football game.

06:47.275 --> 06:49.543
You always root
for the underdogs.

06:49.644 --> 06:51.478
Moses versus Pharaoh,

06:51.579 --> 06:52.747
Job versus Satan,

06:53.781 --> 06:55.049
David versus Goliath.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.718
But who would you say
is the biggest underdog

06:57.818 --> 06:58.586
in the whole Bible?

07:00.922 --> 07:02.723
Jesus.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.526
- Y2K isn't for another
week, but I wanna die now.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.596
- I have a sai.

07:09.931 --> 07:12.099
- Uh, what?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.634
- A sai.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.937
It's a ninja
weapon to, you know,

07:16.037 --> 07:17.004
kill you?

07:18.873 --> 07:20.608
You, you just
said you wanted to die-

07:20.708 --> 07:21.742
- Mr. Kapoor,

07:21.842 --> 07:23.443
can you name
one of the beatitudes?

07:25.880 --> 07:28.049
- Uh... What?

07:28.149 --> 07:30.751
- Blessed are the meek, for
they shall inherit the earth.

07:33.087 --> 07:36.057
- Blessed are the geeks, for
they shall inherit the earth.

07:44.265 --> 07:46.067
- I still
say you can do better.

07:46.167 --> 07:48.069
- No woman
is better than Bethany.

07:48.169 --> 07:49.904
- Megumi Odaka
is so much better.

07:50.004 --> 07:51.772
- What real woman?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.207
- Megumi Odaka is a real woman.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.875
- She's an actress

07:54.976 --> 07:57.912
who played a psychic that
can talk to Godzilla.

07:58.012 --> 07:59.814
But you do raise a good point.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.149
Speaking telepathically
to kaiju like Godzilla

08:02.249 --> 08:03.651
is pretty sexy.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.254
If I were a kaiju,

08:07.355 --> 08:08.990
maybe I could
get it on with her.

08:09.090 --> 08:10.490
- She's a mind reader.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.727
She'd see through anything
superficial you try.

08:12.827 --> 08:14.662
- Oh, just let
me have my fantasy.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.497
A night with a sexy Asian chick.

08:18.766 --> 08:22.069
Followed by
smashing Tokyo.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.738
- Why?

08:23.838 --> 08:25.206
- Don't you wanna
sometimes just like,

08:25.306 --> 08:27.274
smash everything like a kaiju?

08:27.375 --> 08:29.210
- No, actually.
I'd rather be a mecha.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.913
- A mecha? Why
would you wanna be a mecha?

08:33.014 --> 08:36.283
- 'Cause I could
shoot lasers, fly.

08:36.384 --> 08:37.985
You know, come and save the day.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.920
- You're afraid of fire
and heights, Shawn.

08:40.021 --> 08:41.555
- That's not the point.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.858
The point is
the mecha are the hero.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.192
Who wants to be the villain?

08:45.292 --> 08:47.028
- You hate being
the center of attention.

08:47.128 --> 08:48.696
Every time
someone calls on you in class,

08:48.796 --> 08:51.565
you start
sweating like a pickle.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.835
- Come on, Vik.
Let me have my fantasy.
You have yours.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.104
- Shouldn't
you have a fantasy
that might actually come true?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.773
- Why can't this one come true?

08:58.873 --> 09:01.709
- Because we're nerds in the
middle of friggin' Oklahoma.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.013
♪ If I ever get
back to Oklahoma ♪

09:06.113 --> 09:08.916
♪ Gonna nail my
feet to the ground ♪

09:09.016 --> 09:10.851
♪ Too many
stones are in my path ♪

09:10.951 --> 09:13.554
♪ Been trippin'
and fallin' down ♪

09:13.654 --> 09:14.755
- I hope she likes it.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.157
- Likes what?
- The movie.

09:16.257 --> 09:17.725
Enough about the movie.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.160
You should be
worried about whether or not

09:19.260 --> 09:22.263
she wants to hang out with
a couple of weirdos like us.

09:22.363 --> 09:24.732
You're late, Vikram.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.834
We're counting on you
to help with the Japanese
translation, Shawn.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.636
- I've studied Japanese, too.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.904
Yeah, but you suck at it.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.172
- Shut up.

09:31.272 --> 09:32.973
- You shut up.
- Would you two stop fighting?

09:33.074 --> 09:35.209
This is
her first time in America.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.611
We want to make
a good impression.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.247
- Why would anyone wanna
spend their Christmas vacation

09:40.347 --> 09:41.715
in Oklahoma?

09:41.816 --> 09:43.617
Nothing happens in Oklahoma.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.187
- It's not a vacation;
it's a holiday study abroad.

09:46.287 --> 09:48.622
- And who requests
an Indian host family?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.224
This girl must be a weirdo.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.794
- Is that her?

09:55.229 --> 09:56.263
- Yeah.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.265
Miki?

10:01.802 --> 10:03.237
- Hello,

10:03.337 --> 10:05.339
my name is Miki Shimizu.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.108
- And I am Sunita.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.783
- Nice to meet you.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.318
- Oh,
it's nice to meet you.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.670
- I said that right?
- No.

10:41.242 --> 10:43.911
- Yes, well,
welcome to Oklahoma.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.168
I'm sorry
our parents couldn't be here.

11:07.268 --> 11:09.403
They had to go to India
for this family thing.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.406
- India?
- Yeah.

11:13.508 --> 11:15.809
Almost as far away as you.

11:15.910 --> 11:17.945
Gosh, you must be exhausted.

11:18.045 --> 11:18.679
Here, come, this way.

11:19.914 --> 11:21.682
Let me show you to your room.

11:38.933 --> 11:40.100
- No. Wait, come on.
- Leave it.

11:40.201 --> 11:41.936
- We could check in on her.
- Let go.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.904
- What if she doesn't know-
- Let's go back, come on.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.039
- Let go. No, no.
- Come on.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.340
- No, she does, obviously.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.743
Hey, Miki.

11:51.011 --> 11:51.779
Wanna see my room?
It has a lot of
Japanese stuff in it.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.384
- Mm.
- Woo!

11:57.484 --> 11:59.853
Welcome to the Vik cave.

12:02.823 --> 12:03.824
- What do you think?

12:14.502 --> 12:15.769
- Don't scare her.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.848
- What is this?

12:29.950 --> 12:30.784
- No.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.355
What's your favorite anime?

12:34.455 --> 12:35.523
- "The Lion King."

12:35.624 --> 12:38.192
"Lion King"?

12:38.292 --> 12:40.528
What's your favorite
"Lion King" character?

12:41.596 --> 12:42.863
- Simba.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.798
- Me too.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.246
- Dude, dude,
where are the subs?

13:02.550 --> 13:05.252
- I don't think anyone's had
a chance to translate yet.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.922
- It's been 30 years.

13:33.682 --> 13:34.848
- Dude,

13:36.016 --> 13:36.850
1999?

13:38.419 --> 13:39.987
As in this year?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.456
- Of course.

13:42.557 --> 13:43.891
It's "Go! Great Decisive Battle

13:43.991 --> 13:46.327
at the End of
the Century with Rainbows."

13:55.903 --> 14:00.841
- Told you so.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.512
- They're saying something about

14:37.612 --> 14:38.946
a sacred fire?

14:39.714 --> 14:43.518
Blood from a hero's sacrifice.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.274
No, no, no.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.143
- Finish?
- Well, that's it?

15:09.243 --> 15:11.078
- No, there must be a mistake.
There's...

15:11.178 --> 15:13.013
There's no way it just
ends without an ending.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.082
What a load of horsesh---

16:01.462 --> 16:02.496
- Uh,

16:03.430 --> 16:04.632
good morning.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.673
- Get up. Get it off.
- Ow, ow, ow.

16:11.773 --> 16:12.973
- I feel weird.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.242
- I feel like I just worked out.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.411
- You haven't worked
out a day in your life.

16:17.512 --> 16:18.479
- That's exactly my point.

16:18.580 --> 16:20.314
Ooh.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.281
Vik blew up the TV.

16:22.784 --> 16:24.418
- Vik, what did you do?

16:24.519 --> 16:27.655
- I, I just woke up.

16:27.755 --> 16:29.691
- Well, you'll be cleaning
up this mess after school.

16:35.530 --> 16:37.364
- This is school?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.000
- For rich kids.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.003
Or smart
kids with scholarships.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.373
- Does anyone have any
questions for Mickey here?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.044
Come on, let's
get those hands up.

16:52.814 --> 16:55.182
Hunter.
- Yes.

16:55.282 --> 17:00.187
Is it true you sell used
panties in vending machines?

17:04.559 --> 17:06.561
- Vending machines don't...

17:06.661 --> 17:07.629
They don't...

17:09.664 --> 17:10.698
Detention.

17:10.798 --> 17:13.033
- It's the last
day before break.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.669
- Actions have
consequences, Hunter.

17:14.769 --> 17:16.638
Anyone else?
- What?

17:16.738 --> 17:17.739
God, come on.

17:17.839 --> 17:18.773
- Bethany.

17:19.807 --> 17:21.576
- Why did you choose Oklahoma?

17:21.676 --> 17:23.243
- Ah.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.648
Oklahoma is most, mm,

17:26.748 --> 17:29.483
many Indian in America.

17:29.584 --> 17:31.151
Understand?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.787
- That's right. That's right.

17:32.887 --> 17:34.822
Oklahoma has the most
Native American tribes

17:34.923 --> 17:36.189
in all of America.

17:36.290 --> 17:37.457
- I love Indian culture,

17:38.593 --> 17:43.096
so I ask Indian homestay.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.266
- Oh.

17:47.401 --> 17:51.673
Yeah, the Kapoors
are, uh, Indian...

17:58.646 --> 18:00.748
- You know, Indo and Indian,

18:00.848 --> 18:02.482
in Japanese it can be confused.

18:02.584 --> 18:04.084
I'm pretty sure it was
just a clerical error.

18:04.184 --> 18:04.953
- I'm fine, Shawn.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.523
- Oh, it's not that, I just-
- Ooh.

18:08.623 --> 18:11.224
Hey, Kapoor, are you taking
your sister to the pow-wow?

18:11.325 --> 18:14.261
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

18:15.830 --> 18:17.164
- Please stop.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.101
- Uh, what?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.604
- You are not nice.

18:23.805 --> 18:25.540
- Hey, the Yellow Ranger here

18:25.640 --> 18:28.776
has more balls than both of you.
Who knew?

18:28.876 --> 18:30.645
- Why don't
you go to hell, Hunter?

18:30.745 --> 18:32.880
- And why don't you join
Hunter and me in detention,
Mr. Kapoor.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.816
- Thank you, sir.

18:36.751 --> 18:37.518
- Great.

18:39.654 --> 18:41.455
- Uh, have a good time.

18:46.628 --> 18:48.529
I guess, come with me to karate?

19:00.440 --> 19:01.509
Give me that Frisbee.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.246
- What are you in for?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.315
- Smoking.

19:08.983 --> 19:14.187
- Cool.

19:30.905 --> 19:31.939
- Ichi,

19:32.040 --> 19:33.440
ni,

19:33.541 --> 19:34.609
san,

19:34.709 --> 19:35.910
shi,

19:36.010 --> 19:37.277
go.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.513
Ichi,

19:38.613 --> 19:39.714
ni,

19:39.814 --> 19:40.748
san,

19:40.848 --> 19:42.282
shi,

19:42.382 --> 19:43.551
go.

19:43.651 --> 19:44.852
Rei!

19:44.952 --> 19:46.788
- Yes, Newt-sensei.

19:46.888 --> 19:48.255
- Alright.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.659
Now, in honor of our guest

19:51.759 --> 19:55.328
hailing all the way from
the birthplace of Japan,

19:55.429 --> 19:57.899
the birthplace of karate,

19:57.999 --> 19:59.734
which is in Japan,

19:59.834 --> 20:03.538
I would like to demonstrate
an original move, uh,

20:03.638 --> 20:05.673
hailing from
right here in Oklahoma

20:05.773 --> 20:07.240
that I created myself.

20:08.576 --> 20:11.311
And I will
demonstrate all by myself.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.380
But I'm gonna need a volunteer.

20:16.017 --> 20:17.552
Um...

20:17.652 --> 20:19.854
Shawn-kun, come on down.

20:23.925 --> 20:25.560
Good initiative there.

20:25.660 --> 20:26.994
Alright, uh,

20:27.095 --> 20:28.428
it's called the "Do-Kan,"

20:29.697 --> 20:32.667
which in Japanese, I
believe, means ka-boom.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.269
What we do is we distract
the opponent with one hand...

20:37.038 --> 20:38.673
Other hand.

20:38.773 --> 20:41.776
We strike the opponent
with, uh, this hand here,

20:41.876 --> 20:44.411
and, uh, and we're gonna strike
with the right, okay?

20:44.512 --> 20:49.249
But before we do that, we
drop in with the spatula,

20:49.349 --> 20:52.687
we're gonna flip the flapjack,
we're gonna come back,
and boom!

20:54.822 --> 20:56.657
And that is the "Do-Kan."

21:12.740 --> 21:13.808
♪ Still off the hook ♪

21:13.908 --> 21:15.543
♪ Over the line ♪

21:15.643 --> 21:18.546
♪ I keep you reeled in,
rockin' so fine ♪

21:18.646 --> 21:19.914
♪ It's fishin' time ♪

21:20.014 --> 21:21.616
♪ And everybody's
knows my name ♪

22:33.721 --> 22:35.990
- I'm gonna stop by the
faculty holiday party

22:36.090 --> 22:38.559
before the Christmas
cookies are spoken for.

22:38.659 --> 22:40.127
Stay in your seats
until I get back.

22:47.869 --> 22:49.537
- Incoming, Ka-pooper.

22:50.638 --> 22:52.073
- Oh my God.

22:52.173 --> 22:55.643
Y2K can't come soon enough.

22:55.743 --> 22:56.844
- You'd be
better practice over Christmas.

22:56.944 --> 22:57.912
Just like Santa...

23:08.689 --> 23:10.758
- And remember,
it's not who you are;

23:12.693 --> 23:13.527
it's what you do

23:14.929 --> 23:15.897
that makes you a hero.

23:17.965 --> 23:18.799
Arigato.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.402
Now get.

23:26.107 --> 23:28.743
Is that my gorgeous wife?

23:28.843 --> 23:30.778
- Miki
and I had a nice talk.

23:31.879 --> 23:33.748
- Oh, welcome to Tamashi Dojo.

23:33.848 --> 23:35.616
Care to see
our bonsai collection?

23:36.751 --> 23:38.986
It's a little industry joke.

24:31.305 --> 24:32.573
- Oof.

24:37.712 --> 24:39.580
- Your name's Vikram, right?

24:39.680 --> 24:40.648
- It's, um,

24:41.983 --> 24:43.584
Vik with a K.

24:58.332 --> 25:00.634
- Behold
the ancient burial site.

25:00.735 --> 25:03.170
With the return of the Old Gods,

25:03.270 --> 25:04.872
a new Eden will be born.

25:22.089 --> 25:23.758
- Dude, where have you been?
I've been calling you all night.

25:23.858 --> 25:25.159
- It's Christmas vacation, dude.

25:25.259 --> 25:26.794
You're lucky I'm awake at all.

25:26.894 --> 25:28.929
- Didn't I say
this was important?

25:29.030 --> 25:32.099
- I know. You mentioned
that all 10 messages.
Why couldn't you just tell me?

25:32.199 --> 25:34.101
- You're gonna have to
see it for yourself.

25:54.889 --> 25:56.824
- You woke me up early, man.

25:56.924 --> 25:58.159
- I don't get it.

25:58.259 --> 26:00.661
When I was at
karate, I was like, copying

26:01.629 --> 26:03.130
Newt-Sensei's move.

26:09.637 --> 26:13.007
- Dude, you did "Ultraman."

26:15.209 --> 26:18.079
But can you do "Kamen Rider"?
- What?

26:26.287 --> 26:27.922
- Woo!

26:32.893 --> 26:34.995
- That film did
do something to us.

26:35.096 --> 26:35.863
- No duh.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.334
Isn't it awesome?

26:40.434 --> 26:42.369
- What does it mean?
- Well, I think it means...

26:45.840 --> 26:48.042
"Ebirah, Horror of the Deep!"

26:49.310 --> 26:50.744
- Vik, stop screwing around.

26:50.845 --> 26:52.813
This is bad-
- You mean badass.

26:54.715 --> 26:55.683
- Ooh.

26:56.784 --> 26:58.819
Watch where
you point that thing.

26:58.919 --> 27:00.654
- We've gotta figure out
what's happening to us.

27:00.754 --> 27:01.956
- Dude, chill.

27:02.056 --> 27:03.958
- I can't chill.
I'm freaking out.

27:04.058 --> 27:05.292
How are you not
freaking out right now?

27:06.427 --> 27:08.696
- Shawn, for now, can't you
just enjoy being awesome?

27:09.997 --> 27:12.700
It's not every day
we get superpowers.

27:12.800 --> 27:15.836
- Yes, but just name one
tokusatsu where gaining
superpowers

27:15.936 --> 27:17.838
didn't come with
a world-ending problem.

27:17.938 --> 27:18.806
- Okay, point taken,

27:19.840 --> 27:21.842
but we're in Oklahoma.

27:21.942 --> 27:23.844
What can possibly happen here?

27:25.346 --> 27:27.715
- <i>The fire is the</i>
<i>latest in a series of attacks</i>

27:27.815 --> 27:29.783
<i>by a millennial doomsday cult</i>

27:29.884 --> 27:31.986
<i>known as</i>
<i>the Children of the Old Gods.</i>

27:35.356 --> 27:38.859
- Can't they give this
end-of-the-world bull a rest?

27:38.959 --> 27:41.996
Remind me again how I say
grace in her language?

27:42.096 --> 27:44.298
- Uh, Itadakimasu.

27:44.398 --> 27:45.166
- Eat-a-ducky-mess.

27:46.467 --> 27:48.669
- No, it's itadakimasu.

27:49.904 --> 27:51.372
- Yeah, that's what I said.
Eat-a-ducky-mess.

27:54.509 --> 27:56.844
- Let's, let's
just try not saying it.

27:57.978 --> 27:59.313
- Okay.

27:59.413 --> 28:00.347
Whatever.

28:01.516 --> 28:03.417
Just trying to
get something right.

28:03.518 --> 28:05.252
I'm gonna set the table.

28:05.352 --> 28:06.787
Why don't you put the bird in?

28:15.896 --> 28:16.864
- Ah.

28:26.941 --> 28:28.175
- Merry Christmas.

28:28.275 --> 28:29.276
Come on in.

28:29.376 --> 28:30.711
- Merry Christmas.

28:30.811 --> 28:32.880
- Hey, Mr. Gunderson.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.082
- Let me grab that from you.

28:35.182 --> 28:37.751
- Thank you very
much for having me.

28:37.851 --> 28:39.753
- Oh, you're very welcome.

28:39.853 --> 28:41.889
I hope we can show
you a Christmas to tell
your family about

28:41.989 --> 28:43.724
back in China.

28:43.824 --> 28:45.359
Sorry, Japan.

28:45.459 --> 28:46.760
Don't,

28:46.860 --> 28:48.095
don't tell Shawn I said that.

28:49.196 --> 28:51.065
- Are your sisters coming?
- Nope.

28:51.165 --> 28:53.167
They're gonna spend Christmas
with their friends, thank God.

28:53.267 --> 28:54.735
- Oh, that just
means more for us.

28:54.835 --> 28:56.203
You make yourself at home.

28:56.303 --> 28:58.772
Vikram, kitchen.
Real men cook.

28:58.872 --> 28:59.840

29:47.021 --> 29:47.855
- Miki-san...

30:00.635 --> 30:02.436
- Alright, kids,
stop talking in code.

30:03.605 --> 30:07.007
Gentlemen, wanna
check on the big bird?

30:09.943 --> 30:12.112
- Oh, this is my fault.

30:12.212 --> 30:13.581
I zapped the oven.
I broke the oven.

30:14.616 --> 30:16.551
- We could do a sushi turkey.

30:16.651 --> 30:18.452
Get it? 'Cause...

30:19.453 --> 30:24.559
- How do you like Oklahoma?
- Uh, Indian people not here?

30:24.659 --> 30:26.126
- Oh, nonsense. They're
all over the place.

30:26.226 --> 30:29.430
- Ah, where can I find them?

30:29.531 --> 30:31.599
- Everywhere.
They own all the casinos.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.001
- Casino?
- Casinos.

30:34.101 --> 30:35.002
- Ah,.

30:36.638 --> 30:37.471
- Hey.

30:39.373 --> 30:41.609
- Oh, you should
do your "Do-Kan" thing.

30:41.710 --> 30:44.011
- No, it might explode.

30:44.111 --> 30:46.514
- How's it looking?
Are we close in there?

30:46.614 --> 30:48.115
- It's Christmas
turkey. You gotta.

30:48.215 --> 30:49.883
- Oh, fine.
Stand back.

31:15.442 --> 31:17.077
- What's the word?

31:17.177 --> 31:19.614
Alright. Let's get fat.

31:19.714 --> 31:21.048
Don't forget the casserole.

31:24.118 --> 31:27.154
- Ah,.

31:29.624 --> 31:32.126
- Your hands cold, bud?
- No.

31:32.226 --> 31:33.927
- Well, how
you plan to eat with those on?

31:35.095 --> 31:36.196
- No, I'm just-

31:41.969 --> 31:43.470
- Enough with the cosplay.

31:43.571 --> 31:44.338
Let's eat.

31:49.176 --> 31:51.278
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

31:51.378 --> 31:53.046
- Eat-a-ducky-mess.

32:05.392 --> 32:06.927
- Come on.

33:29.309 --> 33:31.713
Well, hello there, Miki-angelo.

33:35.148 --> 33:37.017
Indians, huh?

33:37.852 --> 33:39.086
Okay.

33:39.787 --> 33:41.488
Wanna see Indians?

33:55.503 --> 33:56.538
- Wow.

33:59.339 --> 34:02.342
- It's really cool
that you know so much about
Native American culture.

34:02.442 --> 34:03.477
I've lived here my whole life

34:03.578 --> 34:05.245
and never even
thought about 'em.

34:05.345 --> 34:08.315
- You think I'm cool?

34:08.415 --> 34:09.182
- Yeah.

34:34.642 --> 34:35.677
Hey there.

34:39.246 --> 34:41.081
Hey, are you okay?

34:41.181 --> 34:43.116
- Indian people are dead.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.187
- Uh, some are.

34:48.823 --> 34:49.657
Actually, many.

34:53.795 --> 34:54.796
Are you okay?

34:59.366 --> 35:00.802
Excuse me.

35:00.902 --> 35:04.237
- Uh...

35:05.372 --> 35:06.473
Hello?

35:06.574 --> 35:08.876
- Hey,
is this Vik with a K?

35:08.977 --> 35:10.477
- Yeah, who's this?

35:10.578 --> 35:12.647
- This is
Bethany from school.

35:15.583 --> 35:18.553
- Oh, yeah.

35:18.653 --> 35:19.419
Hi, Bethany.

35:20.688 --> 35:22.790
- So,
what are you doing?

35:23.858 --> 35:24.892
- Uh...

35:26.293 --> 35:27.528
What?

35:27.629 --> 35:31.298
- I mean, do
you wanna like, hang out?

35:51.686 --> 35:52.854
- Yo.

35:52.954 --> 35:54.822
- Vik, I am freaking out.

35:54.922 --> 35:56.858
Where are you right now?

35:56.958 --> 35:58.425
- I, I just...

35:58.526 --> 35:59.493
I, I got a thing.

36:00.728 --> 36:02.295
- What do you mean, a thing?

36:02.396 --> 36:04.532
- Just, just, it's just
something important.

36:04.632 --> 36:06.668
- Something important?
Vik, I'm in trouble.

36:06.768 --> 36:08.235
- You're a smart kid.
You'll figure it out-

36:08.335 --> 36:10.337
- Hey.
- Ooh.

36:10.838 --> 36:12.272
- Vik?

36:12.372 --> 36:13.541
- Uh...

36:13.641 --> 36:15.375
Sup.

36:15.475 --> 36:17.812
- Sup?
- It's short for "what's up?"

36:18.813 --> 36:19.947
- Yeah, I know.

36:20.048 --> 36:21.214
Come on.

36:22.349 --> 36:23.918
- We're not renting a movie?

36:27.354 --> 36:28.321
- Damn it!

36:28.422 --> 36:31.224
Whoa!

36:37.031 --> 36:39.299
- You know, you're fun.

36:39.399 --> 36:40.702
I thought you were a huge nerd.

36:43.370 --> 36:44.839
- What a, what a mean rumor.

37:06.493 --> 37:09.296
- Why do you hang
out, like, all the time,

37:09.396 --> 37:11.231
with that weird kid?

37:11.331 --> 37:12.567
The one who's, like,

37:12.667 --> 37:15.570
into Japanese cartoons.

37:17.404 --> 37:20.007
- We just, uh, study sometimes.

37:21.909 --> 37:23.544
- He really brings you down.

38:18.866 --> 38:19.834
- Whoa!

38:47.128 --> 38:48.996
I think they were
trying to kill me.

38:49.096 --> 38:50.798
They had scythes.

38:50.898 --> 38:52.099
- Like what?

38:52.200 --> 38:54.535
- Scythes?
Like Deathscythe Gundam.

38:54.635 --> 38:56.469
- Oh.
- And they were digging
something out of the ground.

38:56.571 --> 38:57.805
It was just like the film.

38:57.905 --> 38:59.406
Here, I got
a whole bunch of, um,

38:59.507 --> 39:00.975
websites about "Go" over here.

39:01.075 --> 39:02.743
I can't understand
all of the kanji,

39:02.844 --> 39:06.647
but it says
something about a prophecy.

39:06.747 --> 39:09.851
The last days of
the Millennium, 1999.

39:09.951 --> 39:11.752
Right now.

39:11.853 --> 39:12.620
- Cool.

39:13.688 --> 39:14.755
- Cool?

39:14.856 --> 39:16.557
That's it?

39:16.657 --> 39:18.826
- Yeah, why?
- I'm turning into the
mecha from the movie,

39:18.926 --> 39:20.761
and you're transforming too.

39:20.862 --> 39:21.796
You're transforming into-

39:21.896 --> 39:23.363
- Goku.

39:23.463 --> 39:24.866
- No, Goku wasn't in the film.

39:24.966 --> 39:26.901
But there was
a kaiju and there's a mecha.

39:27.001 --> 39:28.135
And I'm turning into the mecha.

39:28.236 --> 39:29.770
So that only really leaves-

39:29.871 --> 39:31.906
Stop it.

39:32.006 --> 39:33.040
- So what?

39:33.140 --> 39:34.709
- So what?
So everything.

39:34.809 --> 39:36.043
Mecha fight kaiju.

39:36.143 --> 39:37.678
And it gets worse.

39:37.778 --> 39:40.147
It says something about
blood from a hero's sacrifice

39:40.248 --> 39:42.850
and a sacred fire to
awaken the Old Gods.

39:42.950 --> 39:45.385
The Old Gods seem to be
important in all this,

39:45.485 --> 39:46.988
so we just need to
figure out what happens-

39:47.088 --> 39:50.057
- Shawn, Shawn, Shawn,
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, Shawn.

39:50.157 --> 39:52.059
You're looking
at this all wrong.

39:52.159 --> 39:54.461
You're turning into a mecha.

39:54.562 --> 39:56.797
I just went on a date
with friggin' Bethany.

39:56.898 --> 39:58.733
That doesn't
happen to guys like us.

40:01.602 --> 40:03.037
- What do
you mean, guys like us?

40:03.137 --> 40:04.939
- I gotta spell it out for you?

40:05.039 --> 40:05.806
Losers.

40:06.974 --> 40:08.175
- We're not losers.

40:08.276 --> 40:11.112
- Yes, we are.
Or I was, but not anymore.

40:12.213 --> 40:14.882
- Okay, but regardless if
we are losers or not,

40:16.083 --> 40:17.785
I need your help with this.

40:17.885 --> 40:21.188
- Come on.
- Like, I need you, Vik.

40:21.289 --> 40:25.526
No one understands or cares
about this kind of stuff,
except for us.

40:25.626 --> 40:26.594
- Except for you.

40:28.596 --> 40:29.429
- What do you mean?

40:30.598 --> 40:31.766
- Anime's your thing,

40:32.867 --> 40:33.701
not mine.

40:35.603 --> 40:36.704
- How can you say that?

40:36.804 --> 40:37.939
- It's not my life.

40:39.507 --> 40:41.108
I outgrew it a long time ago.

40:41.208 --> 40:42.677
- Then why watch
all these movies then?

40:42.777 --> 40:44.578
Like, buy all
these action figures?

40:44.679 --> 40:45.813
- Because you were into it.

40:47.081 --> 40:48.582
And that was cool for a while,

40:48.683 --> 40:52.687
but I can't like something
simply because you do.

40:52.787 --> 40:53.988
I gotta be my own person.

40:56.958 --> 40:58.592
- Okay, we'll watch less anime,

40:58.693 --> 41:00.194
but this,

41:00.294 --> 41:01.494
this is distracting us.

41:01.595 --> 41:03.664
We...
It doesn't matter.

41:03.764 --> 41:04.899
- No, no, no,
no, it does matter.

41:04.999 --> 41:06.901
Why won't you just let
me have this, Shawn?

41:07.001 --> 41:08.202
- Because this isn't you.

41:09.503 --> 41:12.807
- Yes, it is.
Or it will be, if you
stop dragging me down.

41:17.278 --> 41:19.647
- You think I drag you down?

41:26.287 --> 41:29.790
- Look, the old
me wasn't working.

41:32.026 --> 41:33.194
Don't screw this up for me.

41:38.299 --> 41:41.836
- Hey, dorks.
Japanese girls are so petite.

41:41.936 --> 41:43.537
Should I wear
this to my recital?

41:43.637 --> 41:45.239
- Where's Miki?

41:45.339 --> 41:47.141
- She got upset that you were
arguing and wanted to leave

41:47.241 --> 41:48.809
so I lent her my bike.

41:48.909 --> 41:50.111
- You did what?
- Where did she go?

45:17.484 --> 45:18.485
- Do you need a ride?

45:18.587 --> 45:19.753
- Mm.

45:23.991 --> 45:25.893
Thank you, Mr. Gunderson.

45:27.328 --> 45:29.230
- Don't mention it.

45:29.330 --> 45:31.398
I'm just glad to see
Shawn making a new friend.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.168
- Mm.

45:34.268 --> 45:36.737
- I love most of the
things about his school,

45:36.837 --> 45:38.172
but making friends?

45:39.507 --> 45:40.774
Let's just say his peer group

45:42.209 --> 45:44.078
has very different
home lives than him.

45:45.846 --> 45:48.782
Sometimes I don't
get my own kid.

45:51.986 --> 45:53.887
Maybe I'm not
trying hard enough.

45:53.988 --> 45:56.924
Hell, maybe I'm trying too hard.

45:57.024 --> 45:58.058
But I do worry about him,

46:00.261 --> 46:01.929
especially since
his mom passed away.

46:05.165 --> 46:06.200
- Shawn,

46:07.535 --> 46:09.069
is a good boy.

46:10.971 --> 46:11.805
- Yes, he is.

46:16.010 --> 46:17.278
- I had
to buy a sweatshirt.

46:17.378 --> 46:18.812
- Don't worry, we're
not talking about you.

46:19.913 --> 46:20.948
Much.

46:33.595 --> 46:36.363
- They are
discovering their powers.

46:36.463 --> 46:37.965
They could defeat our masters.

46:40.267 --> 46:42.269
We must destroy them.

46:43.571 --> 46:44.938
- No,

46:45.039 --> 46:47.107
we will make
them destroy each other.

46:57.051 --> 47:00.154
- Vik, you have
known about this.

47:00.254 --> 47:02.590
You complained when I didn't
get you your own hotel room.

47:02.691 --> 47:04.992
- I'm sorry if I don't wanna
drive to Dallas for two nights

47:05.092 --> 47:07.529
to watch little kids do some
stupid dance performance.

47:07.629 --> 47:09.430
- It's not stupid.

47:09.531 --> 47:10.565
- Yes, it is.

47:10.665 --> 47:12.099
- Bite me.

47:12.199 --> 47:14.268
- Bite yourself.
- We can hang out later.

47:14.368 --> 47:15.502
- No, no, no, no, no.

47:15.603 --> 47:17.137
I wanna hang out with you now.

47:20.174 --> 47:22.176
I'm going to
hang out with you now.

47:23.545 --> 47:24.445
- Fine.

47:24.546 --> 47:25.513
Be a jerk.

47:27.014 --> 47:28.315
Come on, we're gonna be late.

47:34.054 --> 47:35.523
- So you're gonna be home alone.

47:38.092 --> 47:38.859
- Yeah. Why?

47:41.028 --> 47:43.497
- Newt-sensei, I didn't
know who else to turn to.

47:43.598 --> 47:45.899
- Well, let me see if I
can translate it for you.

47:45.999 --> 47:50.204
The director, Daisuke Ogata,
used to be a big deal.

47:50.304 --> 47:52.072
Almost as big as Kurosawa.

47:52.172 --> 47:55.543
Then he said he had a
vision for the future

47:55.643 --> 47:58.245
he had to turn into an anime.

47:58.345 --> 48:01.048
Only a big otaku
would find this stuff.

48:02.216 --> 48:05.486
Apparently, Ogata
was making a prophecy

48:05.587 --> 48:07.154
about the end of the Millennium.

48:08.288 --> 48:09.390
When the world
would be destroyed

48:09.490 --> 48:12.926
unless a hero
rises and saves it.

48:13.026 --> 48:15.929
But the hero can only be born
if he watches this movie.

48:16.029 --> 48:18.031
- That can't be right.

48:18.132 --> 48:20.401
But there was no
ending to the movie.
It just cut off.

48:20.501 --> 48:22.936
And why was
the maiden tied to the post?

48:23.036 --> 48:25.139
The sacred fire?
The Old Gods?

48:25.239 --> 48:27.374
- Shawn-kun,
you're overthinking it, man.

48:27.474 --> 48:29.009
The monster
will destroy the world

48:29.109 --> 48:30.144
at the end of the Millennium

48:31.378 --> 48:33.681
unless a hero slays him.

48:38.118 --> 48:39.086
Mechas fight kaiju.

48:48.061 --> 48:52.700
♪ Her name is Yoshimi ♪

48:53.735 --> 48:58.573
♪ She's a black belt in karate ♪

49:00.274 --> 49:05.312
♪ Working for the city ♪

49:06.180 --> 49:10.552
♪ She has to
discipline her body ♪

49:10.652 --> 49:15.355
♪ 'Cause
she knows that it's demanding ♪

49:16.256 --> 49:21.094
♪ To defeat
those evil machines ♪

49:24.666 --> 49:27.968
♪ I know she can beat them ♪

49:28.068 --> 49:29.571
- Look at them.

49:29.671 --> 49:33.140
Is it this bad in Japan too?
- Bad?

49:33.240 --> 49:37.277
- Wouldn't it just be
great when it's all over?

49:37.377 --> 49:39.581
No more losers telling
us how it has to be.

49:41.348 --> 49:43.150
- I don't understand.

49:44.151 --> 49:45.587
I like Oklahoma.

49:47.622 --> 49:49.122
- Then you really are special.

49:57.331 --> 49:58.766
- Look, I used
to be just like you.

49:58.867 --> 50:03.136
A scrawny loser, no friends.

50:03.237 --> 50:05.439
Why do you think
I joined the Navy?

50:05.540 --> 50:07.107
'Cause no other
job would take me.

50:07.207 --> 50:09.209
Alrighty.

50:09.309 --> 50:11.546
You get in horse stance,
would you, please?

50:11.646 --> 50:12.614
Thank you.

50:15.482 --> 50:17.619
So then I went to Japan,

50:18.853 --> 50:20.053
and everything changed.

50:21.221 --> 50:23.056
I was,
I was walking tall.

50:24.157 --> 50:26.393
Literally, I was the tallest
person walking around.

50:26.493 --> 50:27.261
Felt fantastic.

50:29.429 --> 50:30.665
Nothing was the same.

50:30.765 --> 50:32.366
And look at me now.

50:32.466 --> 50:36.169
I'm the guy I wanted to
become when I was your age.

50:36.270 --> 50:38.573
But I couldn't be him
until I decided to change.

50:38.673 --> 50:41.141
I had to decide
to change, right?

50:41.241 --> 50:42.610
And I could not change

50:42.710 --> 50:47.615
until I got rid of all the
people who made me who I was.

50:47.849 --> 50:52.085
And I brought in the people
who made me who I am today.

50:54.288 --> 50:57.124
I am the hero of my own story.

50:58.693 --> 50:59.561
And you could be too.

51:01.563 --> 51:02.597
What is it I always say?

51:04.131 --> 51:05.833
It's not-
- It's not who you are,

51:05.934 --> 51:07.134
but what you do.

51:07.234 --> 51:08.636
- That's right.

51:08.736 --> 51:10.705
It's what you do.

51:10.805 --> 51:14.576
It's what you do that makes
you a hero.

51:15.843 --> 51:18.378
Come on up there, mittens.

51:25.887 --> 51:26.854
- Miki?

51:28.388 --> 51:29.456
- You alright, Shawn-kun?

51:35.930 --> 51:37.431
- Arigato, sensei.

51:37.532 --> 51:38.733
- Arigato.

51:48.576 --> 51:50.110
Pick up.

51:56.416 --> 51:58.251
- Come on.
Show me your room.

52:09.196 --> 52:11.298
- Are you, are you sure
this is gonna work?

52:12.299 --> 52:14.267
- Just trust me, honey.

52:14.368 --> 52:15.837
- Alright.

52:15.937 --> 52:17.572
But what,

52:17.672 --> 52:18.706
what if he figures it out?

52:20.240 --> 52:21.876
- You do your part.

52:21.976 --> 52:23.143
I'll do mine.

52:25.980 --> 52:27.649
- Alright.

52:27.749 --> 52:30.450
Alright.

52:35.823 --> 52:37.825
- What's this robot guy?

52:39.894 --> 52:41.495
- Oh, that's a mecha.

52:41.596 --> 52:43.230
They shoot lasers and fly.

52:43.330 --> 52:44.799
- And this?

52:44.899 --> 52:45.667
- That's a kaiju.

52:46.901 --> 52:48.936
They usually fight the mechas.

52:49.037 --> 52:49.804
They're the villain.

52:50.805 --> 52:53.306
- Well, who wants to
mess around with a robot?

52:54.374 --> 52:55.208
But kaiju?

52:56.476 --> 52:57.679
Kaiju are sexy.

53:16.030 --> 53:18.198
- Bethany, um...

53:18.298 --> 53:19.834
- What's the matter?

53:19.934 --> 53:20.835
- Nothing, I, uh...

53:20.935 --> 53:22.870
I feel funny.

53:22.970 --> 53:24.371
- Just go with it.

53:25.907 --> 53:26.741
- Vik?

53:29.711 --> 53:30.912
Miki?

53:31.012 --> 53:32.580
Where are you guys?

53:33.915 --> 53:36.283
Vik?
Why are you all staring at me?

53:42.757 --> 53:44.659
No, no, no.

53:47.795 --> 53:50.363
- Alright, if you
don't want to, that's okay,

53:50.464 --> 53:52.466
but don't bite me.

53:52.567 --> 53:54.602
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

53:56.604 --> 53:58.773
- Oh, my god.

54:01.843 --> 54:02.944
- Bethany, I'm sorry.

54:03.044 --> 54:04.411
I didn't mean it.

54:04.512 --> 54:06.547
I don't know what happened.

54:07.749 --> 54:09.316
- Vik.

54:09.416 --> 54:10.383
Vik.

54:18.926 --> 54:19.961
What the...

54:23.731 --> 54:24.565
Uh...

54:27.602 --> 54:32.439
- You!

54:36.844 --> 54:38.746
- Whoa.
- You did this to me.

54:38.846 --> 54:42.750
You made us watch that film.
- Vik, stop.

54:42.850 --> 54:44.919
Okay, calm down, Vik.
We can figure this out.

54:45.019 --> 54:47.922
- Figure what out?
Look at me.

54:48.022 --> 54:49.924
- I guess
you're not in the mood
to talk right now.

54:50.024 --> 54:51.526
- Where do you
think you're going, Shawn?

54:53.661 --> 54:55.797
Oh no.

54:55.897 --> 54:59.934
Oh no.

55:04.172 --> 55:07.909
- Everything you said
would happen came true,

55:08.009 --> 55:08.776
and then some.

55:09.510 --> 55:10.978
They're definitely gonna fight.

55:15.983 --> 55:17.985
<i>And Nostradamus foretold</i>

55:18.085 --> 55:20.788
<i>that in the year 1999</i>

55:20.888 --> 55:24.592
<i>there would come a King</i>
<i>of Terror, the Antichrist,</i>

55:24.692 --> 55:26.828
<i>at the end of the Millennium.</i>

55:34.936 --> 55:36.403
- This please.

56:47.575 --> 56:49.043
- What do you want?

56:49.143 --> 56:51.812
I think we should meet up.

56:51.913 --> 56:54.048
- You better
not chicken out this time.

56:56.851 --> 56:57.618
Shawn.

56:58.719 --> 56:59.553
Shawn.

57:00.621 --> 57:02.657
Where are you?

57:02.757 --> 57:04.992
Quit hiding.
Dude, I can smell you.

57:05.092 --> 57:06.459
You smell like...

57:06.560 --> 57:10.865
You smell like
a vinyl record. Hm.

57:10.965 --> 57:11.966
- Uh, hey.

57:13.500 --> 57:16.570
- There you
are, you little weasel.

57:16.671 --> 57:18.739
- Look, I'm sorry.

57:18.839 --> 57:21.108
I never should've
made us watch that film.

57:21.208 --> 57:23.911
- You really think
this is about the film, Shawn?

57:24.011 --> 57:25.546
But you're a monster, Vik.

57:25.646 --> 57:27.114
Somebody has to stop you.

57:27.214 --> 57:30.584
- What
are you gonna do about it?

57:30.685 --> 57:32.586
You'll never be a hero, Shawn.

57:32.687 --> 57:33.754
You'll always be a coward.

57:35.122 --> 57:36.791
Stop saying that!

57:39.060 --> 57:41.494
- Ugh, what the hell?
I didn't think you'd actually do it.

57:41.595 --> 57:42.730
- I'm sorry.

57:42.830 --> 57:44.932
The movie
says I have to do this.

57:45.032 --> 57:46.867
- This was
never about the movie!

57:56.043 --> 57:57.545
- Okay,
maybe there's another way.

57:57.645 --> 57:59.680
Let's just think
about this for a minute.

57:59.780 --> 58:01.481
- It's
too late.

58:20.167 --> 58:22.036
You have wings?

58:22.136 --> 58:24.071
- Now that's
what I'm talking about.

59:34.375 --> 59:35.342
You weren't there for me
when I needed you, Vik.

59:35.443 --> 59:37.078
You're never there for me.

59:37.178 --> 59:39.880
- I'm the only
one who's there for you.

59:39.980 --> 59:41.082
Nobody likes you.

59:41.182 --> 59:42.716
- No
matter how hard you try,

59:42.817 --> 59:44.218
nobody's ever gonna like you.

59:44.318 --> 59:46.087
- I hate you.

59:46.187 --> 59:47.321
- And I hate you.

59:56.897 --> 59:58.365
- I'm all you have.

1:00:08.209 --> 1:00:09.276
- Look out!

1:00:17.151 --> 1:00:17.918
Vik.

1:00:46.780 --> 1:00:49.216
- You think I'm cool?

1:00:49.316 --> 1:00:50.351
- Yeah.

1:02:04.858 --> 1:02:06.460
<i>- Oh, Y2K.</i>

1:02:06.561 --> 1:02:08.329
<i>We have talked about</i>
<i>it and talked about it</i>

1:02:08.429 --> 1:02:09.863
<i>and talked about it.</i>

1:02:09.964 --> 1:02:11.365
<i>Well, at midnight tonight,</i>

1:02:12.667 --> 1:02:13.834
<i>some storms are going to</i>
<i>roll in from the southwest.</i>

1:02:14.603 --> 1:02:15.302
<i>The Millennium will be here.</i>

1:02:16.337 --> 1:02:16.370
<i>And you'll know</i>
<i>it here in Oklahoma,</i>

1:02:17.438 --> 1:02:19.740
<i>because, let me</i>
<i>tell you, it's stormy-</i>

1:02:22.142 --> 1:02:23.310
<i>You need to get below ground.</i>
<i>If you don't,</i>

1:02:23.410 --> 1:02:27.014
<i>you might find your</i>
<i>heinie in Kansas tomorrow.</i>

1:02:27.114 --> 1:02:28.916
Hey, buddy. You awake?

1:02:36.090 --> 1:02:39.460
- Okay.
Maybe now's not a good time.

1:02:44.865 --> 1:02:46.033
Uh, yeah, you know what?

1:02:46.133 --> 1:02:46.900
I...

1:02:47.868 --> 1:02:48.969
I'm just gonna say it.

1:02:52.172 --> 1:02:54.942
I can tell
something's eating at you.

1:02:56.611 --> 1:02:57.845
And believe it or not,

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:00.447
I know what you're feeling.

1:03:04.184 --> 1:03:08.956
People will tell you that
growing up is about change,

1:03:10.057 --> 1:03:13.561
but you don't
change as an adult.

1:03:15.563 --> 1:03:16.964
You are who you are.

1:03:18.265 --> 1:03:19.567
And they won't tell you that.

1:03:20.467 --> 1:03:22.002
At least,

1:03:22.102 --> 1:03:22.870
nobody told me that,

1:03:26.273 --> 1:03:27.107
but it's true.

1:03:28.576 --> 1:03:31.945
Even if other
people don't get it,

1:03:33.881 --> 1:03:34.982
hell, even if I don't get,

1:03:43.525 --> 1:03:44.592
just be yourself.

1:03:46.327 --> 1:03:48.596
I'm proud of who you are.

1:03:54.101 --> 1:03:55.336
Your mom would be proud too.

1:03:57.271 --> 1:04:00.307
I wish she was here to
see who you've become.

1:04:02.309 --> 1:04:03.143
Who you've always been

1:04:08.248 --> 1:04:09.517
my hero, if I'm being honest.

1:04:13.454 --> 1:04:14.488
So,

1:04:17.358 --> 1:04:19.893
I guess you'll be spending
New Year's with Vikram?

1:04:20.928 --> 1:04:21.962
Vik.

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:27.000
Have a good time.

1:04:42.316 --> 1:04:43.651
Miki.

1:04:46.353 --> 1:04:47.321
- Shawn?

1:07:24.746 --> 1:07:26.413
- Let her go.

1:07:28.883 --> 1:07:31.553
- Shawn-kun.

1:07:32.787 --> 1:07:35.389
- Newt-sensei?
- You did it.
I knew you'd survive.

1:07:35.489 --> 1:07:36.724
- What,
what's going on here?

1:07:36.824 --> 1:07:39.794
- I got a better question
for you, shaka Shawn.

1:07:39.894 --> 1:07:41.529
What are you?

1:07:41.629 --> 1:07:43.430
- I'm a mecha?

1:07:43.531 --> 1:07:45.600
- You're a loser.

1:07:45.700 --> 1:07:47.100
But you can change

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:49.537
by helping me
release the Old Gods.

1:07:49.637 --> 1:07:50.705
What about the movie?

1:07:50.805 --> 1:07:53.173
- Our people had
to destroy the film.

1:07:53.273 --> 1:07:55.242
We couldn't have
an ending out there

1:07:55.342 --> 1:07:57.679
showing people how
to defeat the Old Gods.

1:07:57.779 --> 1:07:59.079
But with you with us,

1:07:59.179 --> 1:08:00.347
nothing's gonna stop us.

1:08:00.447 --> 1:08:02.850
Now, come on,
help us save the world.

1:08:10.257 --> 1:08:12.259
- You made
me kill my best friend.

1:08:13.661 --> 1:08:15.295
I won't be part of your world.

1:08:21.669 --> 1:08:26.239
- You are really starting
to disappoint me, Shawn-kun.

1:08:33.915 --> 1:08:36.350
- Vik with a K!

1:08:43.390 --> 1:08:44.157
- No.

1:08:49.597 --> 1:08:50.364
- Jeez.

1:08:52.700 --> 1:08:54.134
- You're not dead.

1:08:54.234 --> 1:08:56.436
Ah, just took a swim.

1:08:56.537 --> 1:08:58.506
Hey, uh, what I said...

1:08:59.874 --> 1:09:01.208
- You were right.

1:09:01.308 --> 1:09:02.476
We have each other.

1:09:04.277 --> 1:09:05.245
Oh, Miki.
Oh, oh.
- Allow me.

1:09:05.345 --> 1:09:07.515
I got it.
- Oh, please.

1:09:07.615 --> 1:09:09.917
- I can cut the laser-
- No, look what happens.

1:09:10.018 --> 1:09:11.318
- Lasers cut-
- I got it.

1:09:11.418 --> 1:09:12.787
- I got this.
- Shawn, let me.

1:09:12.887 --> 1:09:13.655
I got the nails.

1:09:16.824 --> 1:09:17.792
- Get them!

1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:20.394
- Oh, gosh.

1:09:51.793 --> 1:09:53.828
- Yes.

1:09:53.928 --> 1:09:54.929
- Vik.

1:09:58.032 --> 1:09:59.834
- Bethany?

1:10:01.736 --> 1:10:03.738
- Why are you helping him?

1:10:04.906 --> 1:10:06.574
Because he's my friend.

1:10:08.341 --> 1:10:09.577
- Ha!

1:10:09.677 --> 1:10:11.879
- Vik!

1:10:13.748 --> 1:10:16.249
And he'll always hold you back.

1:10:20.088 --> 1:10:21.723
- Shawn-kun.

1:10:24.424 --> 1:10:25.292
- Mecha sword!

1:10:31.866 --> 1:10:33.233
- Yee-ha!

1:10:46.948 --> 1:10:48.716
I don't wanna do this.

1:10:48.816 --> 1:10:50.484
You could have
been my best student.

1:10:50.585 --> 1:10:51.886
I was your best student.

1:10:51.986 --> 1:10:52.954
Do-Kan!

1:10:54.055 --> 1:10:55.757
- Ow, ow, ow.

1:10:59.326 --> 1:11:02.764
- Well
done, Shawn Wayne.

1:11:04.932 --> 1:11:06.567
Finish it.

1:11:06.667 --> 1:11:07.902
- No.

1:11:08.002 --> 1:11:09.269
You're wrong, Newt-sensei.

1:11:13.074 --> 1:11:15.042
You never needed to change.

1:11:15.143 --> 1:11:16.409
You just had to be yourself.

1:11:23.383 --> 1:11:24.619
- There's gotta be a better way.

1:11:26.554 --> 1:11:27.387
- There is.

1:11:30.925 --> 1:11:32.026
- No!

1:11:38.099 --> 1:11:39.366
- Why did you do that?

1:11:40.535 --> 1:11:41.869
You are
supposed to be one of us.

1:11:43.004 --> 1:11:44.038
One of the heroes.

1:11:51.145 --> 1:11:52.379
- I am.

1:11:56.884 --> 1:11:59.053
- Newt-sensei.

1:12:11.098 --> 1:12:12.399
Whoa, okay, okay.

1:12:15.603 --> 1:12:17.337
Okay, maybe you could stop?

1:12:19.106 --> 1:12:20.107
Vik?

1:12:20.208 --> 1:12:22.510
- Oh, uh...

1:12:22.610 --> 1:12:23.778
Easy, lady.

1:12:25.146 --> 1:12:26.848
Uh, guys?

1:12:31.886 --> 1:12:33.420
- Hero's blood.

1:12:33.521 --> 1:12:34.722
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1:12:35.857 --> 1:12:36.891
- And

1:12:39.827 --> 1:12:40.661
sacred fire.

1:13:36.617 --> 1:13:37.450
- Oh, loser.

1:13:43.124 --> 1:13:45.993
- Whoa.

1:13:47.828 --> 1:13:49.864
- Hey, where are you going?

1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:54.835
- Miki, you killed it.

1:13:54.936 --> 1:13:57.538
- I did it.
Vision Quest.

1:14:00.708 --> 1:14:03.577
- Guys?
Uh, guys?

1:14:04.278 --> 1:14:05.880
Guys?

1:14:05.980 --> 1:14:08.950
Oh, gosh, is
that supposed to glow?

1:14:09.050 --> 1:14:10.751
Shawn?

1:15:07.975 --> 1:15:10.711
- Mecha,
kaiju, it doesn't matter.

1:15:11.712 --> 1:15:14.882
If I'm gonna die,
I'm glad we're together.

1:15:17.218 --> 1:15:19.020
- Together.

1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:20.121
That's it!

1:15:20.221 --> 1:15:21.956
- That's what?

1:15:22.056 --> 1:15:23.290
- I think
I figured out the ending
to the movie.

1:15:23.391 --> 1:15:25.626
But it was destroyed.

1:15:25.726 --> 1:15:28.829
- No, listen,
you know how mecha combine
into one giant robot?

1:15:28.929 --> 1:15:30.064
Yeah, to defeat a Kaiju.

1:15:31.098 --> 1:15:31.932
- Yeah, but
this movie is different.

1:15:32.833 --> 1:15:33.768
The kaiju isn't
the villain, remember?

1:15:34.668 --> 1:15:35.569
- Do
you think we could do it?

1:15:36.570 --> 1:15:37.004
- Do you
have any other ideas?

1:15:39.974 --> 1:15:41.142
- Nope.

1:17:26.347 --> 1:17:31.085
- 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

1:17:31.185 --> 1:17:35.823
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1:18:31.078 --> 1:18:31.912
- Vik!

1:18:38.085 --> 1:18:39.153
Vik.

1:18:44.358 --> 1:18:45.392
- Shawn.

1:18:49.396 --> 1:18:50.798
- Um...

1:18:51.432 --> 1:18:52.466
- Where's Miki?

1:18:54.201 --> 1:18:55.836
- Do you think she's naked too?

1:18:59.574 --> 1:19:01.408
- <i>From Paris</i>
<i>to Tokyo to New York,</i>

1:19:01.509 --> 1:19:03.110
<i>all indications are</i>

1:19:04.411 --> 1:19:05.246
