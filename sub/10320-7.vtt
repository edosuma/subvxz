01:00.228 --> 01:04.733
Kimberlina, feast your eyes
upon the most beautiful ice cream cake

01:04.816 --> 01:06.652
for our most beautiful daughter.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.825
Who is Father Flanagan
and why is he on Ramona's cake?

01:13.617 --> 01:14.618
Oh, boy.

01:14.701 --> 01:19.289
So when you told me to check the cake, you
meant I should actually check the cake?

01:21.667 --> 01:22.751
Hey, guys.

01:23.585 --> 01:26.338
There's my birthday girl!

01:27.881 --> 01:30.634
I can't believe my baby
is officially a teenager.

01:30.843 --> 01:32.845
Everything is really gonna change.

01:33.053 --> 01:35.973
- Can I go to an R-rated movie?
- No.

01:36.974 --> 01:39.768
- Can I go to a concert on my own?
- No.

01:40.519 --> 01:44.064
- Then what's the big change?
- I'm the mother of a teenager!

01:45.607 --> 01:47.693
I need to do something big to celebrate.

01:48.234 --> 01:51.697
How about a tattoo,
like the Chinese symbol for love?

01:51.905 --> 01:56.368
Yeah, that sounds good, until you find out
it actually means pork fried rice.

01:57.202 --> 02:01.707
For the 1,000th time...
this was not a mistake.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.087
Do I or do I not love pork fried rice?

02:08.547 --> 02:11.299
[unintelligible bickering]

02:11.383 --> 02:15.095
Guys! Please! Today is my birthday.

02:15.178 --> 02:18.181
And all I want is for you to get along.
Just for one day.

02:18.390 --> 02:21.309
Honey, that's no problem. Right, Fernando?

02:21.518 --> 02:24.938
I vow on my life
and everything I hold sacred

02:25.022 --> 02:28.025
that I will cause no drama!

02:29.609 --> 02:32.278
Starting now
because that was very dramatic.

02:33.572 --> 02:36.282
Here. Why don't you open
one of your presents?

02:36.366 --> 02:38.702
It might be something
for your party tonight.

02:40.579 --> 02:43.707
[gasps]
It's the Jeffrey Campbells I wanted!

02:45.000 --> 02:46.877
Thank you, Mom! Thank you, Papa!

02:47.086 --> 02:49.379
And most of all,
thank you, Jeffrey Campbell!

02:51.631 --> 02:54.259
We did good, didn't we, honey?

02:54.342 --> 02:56.803
Yes, we did, baby.

02:56.887 --> 03:00.099
Look at us getting along. See, Ramona?

03:00.181 --> 03:02.976
You can take your hand off my butt now.

03:04.144 --> 03:05.437
[both gasp]

03:05.520 --> 03:09.566
Oh, look! Our teenager's first steps!

03:09.775 --> 03:12.611
You can do it, baby, you can do it.
Don't look down!

03:12.694 --> 03:15.114
Yes! Oh, yes, you did it.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.656
Oh, good girl!

03:18.784 --> 03:20.744
- Hey, Deej.
- Hey, Steve.

03:20.953 --> 03:22.913
I'm here to pick up Comet Jr. Jr.

03:22.996 --> 03:26.750
Let me tell you, I was so lonely last
night in that big old bed all by myself.

03:26.959 --> 03:29.210
I'm envious of that empty bed.

03:29.294 --> 03:33.006
Last night, Max, Tommy and Cosmo
crawled in with me. And Kimmy.

03:34.049 --> 03:36.426
She really doesn't like lightning.

03:37.177 --> 03:40.472
That was actually just kind of a hint
that I'm not dating anyone.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.348
Don't feel bad. Neither am I.

03:44.684 --> 03:47.062
You know,
why don't we go out to dinner sometime

03:47.146 --> 03:49.189
and talk about us not dating anyone?

03:49.397 --> 03:53.443
Well, as long as it's not an official date
and there's no pressure, that'd be fun.

03:53.652 --> 03:56.071
Well, I look forward to not dating you.

03:57.072 --> 03:59.449
It's a date, to not date.

04:01.076 --> 04:03.162
Comet Jr. Jr. is ready ready!

04:03.244 --> 04:05.622
[Steve] Oh, sweetheart!

04:08.500 --> 04:11.795
- Hey, what happened to Dr. Harmon?
- I am Dr. Harmon.

04:12.004 --> 04:17.009
No, no, I mean the older, shorter,
less-ruggedly-handsome Dr. Harmon.

04:18.051 --> 04:21.262
That's his father.
Matt's filling in while he's on vacation.

04:21.471 --> 04:23.015
- Hi, I'm Matt.
- I'm Steve.

04:23.223 --> 04:26.018
You're just working here with D.J.
temporarily, right?

04:26.101 --> 04:30.480
Well, that was the plan, but I'm really
starting to like San Francisco, so...

04:30.689 --> 04:32.691
Well, your wife must miss you, though.

04:33.942 --> 04:37.445
- I don't have a wife.
- Oh. Then your husband must miss you.

04:39.156 --> 04:41.574
Nope. Straight and single.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.953
Can we stop shaking hands now?

04:46.621 --> 04:51.710
Wow, okay. So D.J.'s working with a
good-looking, single, straight guy. Great!

04:52.752 --> 04:55.380
We gotta fix you up.
You know, you need a good woman.

04:55.463 --> 04:59.176
You need a hot woman.
You need Kimmy Gibbler!

05:00.760 --> 05:03.055
Oh, good idea. She's my best friend.

05:03.263 --> 05:05.765
- A lot of fun.
- Classic girl next door.

05:05.974 --> 05:09.144
You're welcome.
Invite me to the wedding. See you, guys.

05:10.854 --> 05:12.355
Bye.

05:13.523 --> 05:16.068
You know, it's not a bad idea.

05:16.151 --> 05:19.654
We're actually throwing a party tonight
for Kimmy's daughter.

05:19.738 --> 05:22.365
Come by, if you want. There'll be wine.

05:22.574 --> 05:26.245
Oh. Drinking with other people?
That's a refreshing change of pace.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.247
[laughing]

05:28.329 --> 05:31.457
What are you guys laughing about?
Is the Kimmy thing still on?

05:36.171 --> 05:38.673
I'm not sure
why I'm making this place spotless

05:38.757 --> 05:41.885
before 20 teenagers show up
and undo everything I just did.

05:44.930 --> 05:47.266
Oh, wait. I do know why.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.228
So I got good news and bad news.

05:51.436 --> 05:54.439
The good news is
I finally got Cosmo to poop outside.

05:54.647 --> 05:57.483
The bad news is it was outside my bedroom.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.906
[sighs] Max, these accidents
really have got to stop.

06:03.115 --> 06:06.076
Oh, I'm not sure it was an accident.

06:06.159 --> 06:10.247
He was looking right at me
with a big smile when he did it.

06:15.085 --> 06:17.587
Hey! How was the birthday shopping spree?

06:18.379 --> 06:21.466
Amazing. I got my first designer dress
for the party.

06:21.549 --> 06:24.636
It's an Elizabeth and James
by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

06:30.142 --> 06:33.478
At these prices, no wonder
they don't need to act anymore.

06:39.109 --> 06:40.819
Papa, you're doing my hair later?

06:40.902 --> 06:44.656
I want keratin treatment, extensions,
curls, highlights, volumizer.

06:44.864 --> 06:47.326
In other words, the Full Fernando.

06:49.786 --> 06:51.412
I keep forgetting you did hair.

06:51.621 --> 06:55.375
Yes, before I was
in the dangerous world of auto racing,

06:55.458 --> 06:59.171
I was in the even more dangerous world
of women's hairdressing.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.257
That's how we met.

07:02.423 --> 07:08.680
Yes, Kimberlina wanted to be
a dirty blonde and I happily obliged.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.648
[sighs]

07:20.441 --> 07:21.609
[sighs]

07:23.653 --> 07:26.990
Wow! They're not kidding
when they say this stuff attracts women!

07:28.241 --> 07:30.535
[gasps] I could smell you
from the kitchen.

07:31.536 --> 07:36.041
It's my own unique body spray combo
of Dark Temptation and Excite.

07:37.334 --> 07:40.962
Is this new smell cloud and look
Lola-related?

07:41.171 --> 07:43.256
Yeah, she's coming to Ramona's party.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.508
Figured I'd make my move.

07:47.427 --> 07:49.054
Mind if I make a couple tweaks?

07:49.262 --> 07:50.930
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:51.514 --> 07:55.310
Uh... Well, let's lose the glasses
'cause it's night.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.478
Makes sense.

07:57.687 --> 08:02.025
And, uh, you know, maybe the hat
'cause you've got a great head of hair.

08:02.234 --> 08:05.570
- It is one of my top three features.
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.653 --> 08:09.449
And it's too warm for a jacket,
so that needs to come off.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.034
Alright.

08:11.910 --> 08:16.164
And I'm not gonna sugar-coat this.
I've seen nicer chains on snow tires.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.086
Perfect!

08:21.836 --> 08:23.422
But now I'm just me.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.883
Exactly!
And that's what Lola's gonna like.

08:26.966 --> 08:30.345
If she doesn't like "just you,"
tons of other girls out there will.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.849
- Have some faith in your swagger.
- Got a can of Swagger right here!

08:34.933 --> 08:36.558
No, no, no, no!

08:38.270 --> 08:39.938
Okay, Cosmo.

08:40.020 --> 08:44.484
Mom says you gotta stop going
in the house, but I have a better idea.

08:47.362 --> 08:49.906
Your very own potty trainer!

08:52.242 --> 08:55.287
It worked for me and it can work for you.

08:56.871 --> 08:59.582
Now just relax. Pretend I'm not here.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.800
You want a magazine or something?

09:13.513 --> 09:16.349
I present to you the fabulous Ramona.

09:16.433 --> 09:17.934
Hair by Fernando.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.356
Yeah, yeah! You look awesome!

09:23.523 --> 09:26.025
Doesn't she look awesome?
Mom, can I go now?

09:27.986 --> 09:30.071
Yes. Thank you for pretending to care.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.534
You really do look beautiful.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.202
Thank you.

09:36.661 --> 09:39.080
The hair's a little much.

09:41.207 --> 09:42.501
You may leave too!

09:45.003 --> 09:49.257
This day has been so great already.
Feels like we're a real family again.

09:49.466 --> 09:52.552
Especially when we got
the family meal deal at Pizza Hut.

09:53.845 --> 09:58.641
Nothing says "family" like pizza
with wieners hiding in the crust.

09:58.850 --> 10:01.520
- Let's get some pictures.
- Yes!

10:02.812 --> 10:04.523
Here, Stephanie.

10:04.564 --> 10:07.942
Oh. I'm the official Gibbler
family photographer.

10:08.693 --> 10:10.611
Okay. Well, everybody smile.

10:10.820 --> 10:13.198
Alright, give me some pouty lips.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.617
Not you, Fernando!

10:16.742 --> 10:18.328
[doorbell ringing]

10:18.537 --> 10:19.745
Here we go.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.543
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, D.J.

10:25.084 --> 10:28.254
I brought some Hawaiian Punch
for the little kids

10:28.463 --> 10:30.840
and some tequila for the big kids.

10:32.175 --> 10:35.136
I'm so glad you came by.
That's my friend Kimmy Gibbler.

10:35.345 --> 10:39.057
- The one taking the picture?
- No, the one getting her picture taken.

10:39.265 --> 10:43.895
- She certainly looks taken.
- She's unattached.

10:44.103 --> 10:46.398
[Matt] She certainly looks attached.

10:46.606 --> 10:49.609
That's her soon-to-be ex-husband.
He's out of the picture.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.445
[Matt] He certainly looks in the picture.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.156
I could do this all day.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.663
[sighs] Wow! This place looks amazing.

11:02.872 --> 11:06.709
I'm gonna hire Gibbler Style Party
Planning for my party-planning needs.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.546
[Kimmy] Thanks, Lola.

11:13.466 --> 11:15.427
This will look great on my website.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.057
There's Lola.
Oh, what should I say to her?

11:21.140 --> 11:25.103
Girls love compliments. Tell her you
love her hair and she has beautiful eyes.

11:25.311 --> 11:26.812
Ah. I'm all over that.

11:29.524 --> 11:31.025
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:31.234 --> 11:33.861
You have beautiful hairy eyes.

11:39.033 --> 11:40.701
Nailed it!

11:41.411 --> 11:46.874
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Ramona's epic 13th birthday party!

11:47.083 --> 11:49.419
[whooping and cheering]

11:49.628 --> 11:52.422
We've paid off the cops.
We've warned the neighbors.

11:52.631 --> 11:56.008
The only thing left is to ask you guys
the most important question:

11:56.217 --> 11:57.427
y'all ready for this?

11:57.636 --> 11:59.137
[cheering]

11:59.220 --> 12:01.180
[music plays, then cuts out]

12:01.264 --> 12:02.432
[groaning]

12:03.391 --> 12:08.062
Uh... [chuckles] Well, it looks like our
electrical panel wasn't ready for this.

12:08.813 --> 12:10.064
[stammers]

12:10.148 --> 12:14.277
Little glitch, party people. In the
meantime, let's keep this party going!

12:14.360 --> 12:17.363
Here we go! We've got music! Alright!

12:17.447 --> 12:19.198
Oh, yeah!

12:19.407 --> 12:21.409
[tinny music playing over phone]

12:22.577 --> 12:23.953
[phone ringing]

12:24.579 --> 12:26.331
Hold on. I gotta take this.

12:27.832 --> 12:29.292
Hello?

12:29.501 --> 12:32.753
No, you know, I'm not that happy
with my long-distance service.

12:35.423 --> 12:38.301
Well, Cosmo, the power's out.

12:39.093 --> 12:41.680
Don't be scared. It's probably nothing.

12:43.139 --> 12:45.933
Or it's the zombie apocalypse.

12:50.605 --> 12:54.567
Since the world's ending,
you can poop and pee wherever you want.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.072
Halt! State your name!

13:01.115 --> 13:04.076
It's Mommy and Tommy.
We just blew a fuse.

13:04.285 --> 13:07.372
How do I know you're my mom
and not a zombie?

13:08.373 --> 13:11.000
This is why I don't want you
watching scary movies.

13:13.503 --> 13:16.214
You seem to be avoiding
the zombie question.

13:18.675 --> 13:20.968
Max, I am not a zombie.

13:21.594 --> 13:24.514
Okay, but what about that baby?

13:29.143 --> 13:31.521
He's got the blank stare and the drool.

13:31.604 --> 13:33.898
Classic zombie.

13:39.237 --> 13:43.032
We're gonna have the power back on
as soon as possible, everyone.

13:43.115 --> 13:47.495
Oh! In the meantime, how about we have
a piece of birthday ice cream cake?

13:49.205 --> 13:52.709
Um... Well, make that
birthday ice cream soup.

13:54.001 --> 13:58.130
Here. Alright, who's thirsty
for a cup of birthday cake?

13:59.215 --> 14:00.966
Yeah, that's delicious.

14:01.050 --> 14:04.637
Here, it looks great, right? Right?
Delicious, no?

14:06.222 --> 14:07.390
Stephanie, help!

14:07.599 --> 14:12.186
I just got two texts about how lame my
party is from people who aren't even here.

14:14.313 --> 14:15.774
I know what to do.

14:15.981 --> 14:19.151
You guys, come on.
You don't need electricity to have fun!

14:19.235 --> 14:22.280
When I was your age,
we would've loved for the power to go out.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.865
Okay, everybody, pair up and make out!

14:27.201 --> 14:30.204
Nobody pair up! Nobody make out!

14:33.416 --> 14:35.627
This is not as epic as I hoped.

14:38.963 --> 14:40.381
I know!

14:41.006 --> 14:43.884
Who wants to hear a ghost story?

14:44.885 --> 14:45.886
Yeah? Okay.

14:45.970 --> 14:48.264
It was a dark and stormy night.

14:48.473 --> 14:51.392
The wind was whistling
through the bare tree branches.

14:51.476 --> 14:53.311
[makes ghostly noises]

14:53.394 --> 14:55.896
And suddenly, there was a clap of thunder.

14:56.105 --> 14:57.649
[yells]

14:59.024 --> 15:00.318
Then what happened?

15:02.487 --> 15:05.990
That's all I got. I really was hoping
the power would be on by now.

15:08.660 --> 15:11.120
Since Fernando's with the electrician,

15:11.329 --> 15:13.539
this is a good time
to meet Dr. Matt Harmon.

15:13.623 --> 15:16.167
- Matt, Kimmy.
- Pleasure to meet you.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.171
[choking]

15:21.046 --> 15:24.550
Either you're playing charades
or you're choking to death.

15:24.759 --> 15:26.385
She's choking on a mini corn dog!

15:28.638 --> 15:30.097
You're choking on a meatball?

15:31.307 --> 15:33.017
Okay, let me try to help.

15:36.145 --> 15:38.564
I told you it was a mini corn dog.

15:40.149 --> 15:43.820
[gasps] You saved my life! Thank you!

15:45.446 --> 15:48.616
The electrician said that...
What is this?!

15:50.785 --> 15:52.953
Fernando, it's not what you think.

15:53.037 --> 15:56.666
I think a tall handsome man
was hugging my wife.

15:58.376 --> 16:00.169
- She was just...
- I challenge you.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.682
To a dish wash?

16:15.184 --> 16:16.895
He was saving my life.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.479
I was choking.

16:23.651 --> 16:25.110
My mistake.

16:26.571 --> 16:30.115
Thank you! Thank you for saving
the life of my beloved!

16:33.786 --> 16:35.413
I'm gonna go.

16:38.583 --> 16:43.588
- I am sorry tonight was so weird.
- Why would you say it's weird?

16:43.671 --> 16:46.883
Just because I got slapped
and kissed by the same man?

16:46.966 --> 16:48.092
[chuckles]

16:48.968 --> 16:51.846
You're pretty funny
when you've got some tequila in you.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.473
You're pretty cute
when I've had some tequila in me.

16:55.641 --> 17:00.312
I mean, not that I don't always think
that you're cute or...

17:01.188 --> 17:03.023
I'm gonna go before I speak again.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.903
See you Monday.
We're neutering a border collie.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.446
I can't wait.

17:09.530 --> 17:12.156
Did you love Kimmy? She's great, right?

17:15.202 --> 17:17.997
Come on. I'll walk you to your car
and make sure you leave.

17:21.917 --> 17:25.421
I said I was sorry. Three times.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.091
If I say it again,
it starts to lose sincerity.

17:29.300 --> 17:33.345
This is so like you, Fernando. You fly
off the handle at the smallest things!

17:33.554 --> 17:36.682
I can't help it! I'm very possessive
of the things I possess.

17:38.517 --> 17:41.061
You don't possess me.
This is why you never will!

17:41.270 --> 17:43.856
[Fernando] Stop talking like that!

17:46.567 --> 17:47.652
Great.

17:48.611 --> 17:52.949
My party completely sucks and you guys
couldn't even get along for one day.

17:56.744 --> 17:57.912
[Kimmy] Ramona!

18:02.500 --> 18:03.626
Honey!

18:05.503 --> 18:07.046
Honey.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.801
I'm so sorry you had to see us argue.

18:13.928 --> 18:16.014
You promised me you would get along.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.098
It was all my fault.

18:18.182 --> 18:21.143
I slapped a strange man
with a rubber glove.

18:22.478 --> 18:24.814
I would like to say
it will never happen again,

18:24.897 --> 18:27.399
but that's what I said
the last time it happened.

18:29.068 --> 18:31.070
I'm so stupid.

18:31.737 --> 18:35.867
I actually got my hopes up that we'd be
a family again, like we used to be.

18:36.659 --> 18:41.246
Ramona, it can't be the same since
your papa and I are no longer together.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.874
But we're still your family.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.960
We both love you so much.

18:46.794 --> 18:49.881
But you guys almost got along
for a whole day.

18:49.964 --> 18:53.843
It was so nice.
Why can't it be like that all the time?

18:56.012 --> 18:57.429
Honey...

18:59.682 --> 19:04.311
there are some people who love each
other, but aren't meant to live together.

19:05.980 --> 19:09.775
But no matter what happens between us,
we will always be your parents.

19:10.902 --> 19:13.529
And we're always going to be here for you.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.489
You promise?

19:15.698 --> 19:19.201
Of course.
And that's a promise I can keep.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.495
Unlike the whole rubber glove business.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.917
Well, thanks for trying.

19:26.584 --> 19:29.045
It was almost a perfect day.

19:29.128 --> 19:30.588
Well, the day's not over.

19:30.796 --> 19:33.424
Get back down there. Have fun.
Your friends are waiting.

19:34.050 --> 19:36.719
Nah, the party was a dud.

19:37.845 --> 19:40.098
They probably all went home by now.

19:41.348 --> 19:45.436
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

19:45.686 --> 19:49.648

[whooping and cheering]

20:02.870 --> 20:05.623
You guys! Thanks for not bailing.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.876
We're here for you, not for the party.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.588
But you might wanna stay off Instagram
for a day or two.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.134
Make a wish. Blow out the candles.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.432
[cheering]

20:25.768 --> 20:27.853
Did you wish for the power
to come back on?

20:28.062 --> 20:31.649
No. I wished for something else.

20:35.611 --> 20:38.322
Alright. Let's get this party restarted!

20:38.530 --> 20:40.158
[cheering]

20:43.661 --> 20:46.580
Alright, take two. Y'all ready for this?

20:46.789 --> 20:48.040
[whooping and cheering]

20:48.124 --> 20:49.625
[pop music playing]

20:51.251 --> 20:53.129
[shrieking]

20:54.713 --> 20:56.966
Hey, uh... Do you wanna dance?

20:57.049 --> 21:01.470
- I'm already dancing.
- Uh, okay. Can I dance next to you?

21:01.679 --> 21:03.222
I guess.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.101
That's how you do it.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.604
So are you telling me
no one here is a zombie?

21:10.813 --> 21:13.107
- [D.J.] No.
- [Max] What about Jackson?

21:14.692 --> 21:17.195
Okay, he might be part-zombie.

21:25.995 --> 21:29.207
Ugh. Stationery. Who gives stationery?

21:29.414 --> 21:30.916
My mother.

21:32.918 --> 21:36.296
That's her go-to gift since she was fired
from the stationery store

21:36.380 --> 21:38.216
for stealing all the stationery.

21:39.550 --> 21:42.970
I'll use them to write thank-you notes
and send them in the actual mail.

21:43.179 --> 21:45.264
It's gonna be so retro!

21:46.598 --> 21:48.184
- Thank you.
- Love you.

21:48.392 --> 21:49.434
[speaks Spanish]

21:50.477 --> 21:51.520
[speaks Spanish]

21:56.567 --> 21:59.737
The one good thing
we did in this world was that kid.

21:59.945 --> 22:05.409
- Ramona and you are the loves of my life.
- That's the one thing I don't question.

22:05.910 --> 22:10.164
I admit... I have my faults.
And I make mistakes.

22:11.373 --> 22:15.460
But I'm really, really, really trying
to be a better man for Ramona.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.713
And for you.

22:18.172 --> 22:21.341
I know. And I appreciate that.

22:23.719 --> 22:25.054
Hug?

22:26.264 --> 22:27.723
How about a high-five?

22:41.946 --> 22:43.488
Hmm...

22:43.572 --> 22:45.532
What did I just do?

22:46.284 --> 22:48.077
And why did I do it?

22:48.869 --> 22:51.038
And why did it feel so good?

22:52.164 --> 22:53.999
[dog yapping]

22:55.209 --> 22:57.878
Max, you're here.

22:58.045 --> 23:00.798
Did you see anything
you weren't supposed to see?

23:01.006 --> 23:04.051
No. Just you two making out.

23:05.844 --> 23:08.889
For, like, a really long time.

23:09.389 --> 23:12.726
Max, I don't want Ramona
or anyone else to find out about this,

23:12.810 --> 23:14.728
so you have to keep this a secret.

23:14.937 --> 23:18.649
Oh. I am terrible at keeping secrets.

23:18.732 --> 23:21.819
I hide all my Halloween candy
in my closet.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.321
Why would I tell you that?

23:23.528 --> 23:26.031
Because I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

23:27.116 --> 23:31.036
Look, if anybody asks any questions,
you say nothing.

23:31.245 --> 23:32.288
I can do that.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.457
- Hey, what's up?
- [both] Nothing!

23:38.669 --> 23:40.879
- What's going on with Max?
- Nothing!

23:44.675 --> 23:45.801
What just happened?

23:46.010 --> 23:47.094
