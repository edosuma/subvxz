00:01.658 --> 00:03.507
I'm just not. Right now.

00:04.281 --> 00:07.307
It came out of nowhere. I'm not
looking for a relationship right now.

00:07.331 --> 00:09.865
I think your pussy's
broken. Where are we going?

00:09.932 --> 00:11.866
I'm just getting my shit together.

00:11.934 --> 00:14.952
Maybe we should get our shit together
separately and see what happens.

00:14.977 --> 00:17.557
- Is...
- We need to find you somebody.

00:18.096 --> 00:20.417
All right now, it's open mic night.

- Huh?

01:08.089 --> 01:11.189
- I'm hungry. Let's go!
- Okay!

01:18.649 --> 01:20.919
Wait a minute,

01:20.944 --> 01:23.788
so you're trying to tell me you
went all the way to Daniel's house

01:23.813 --> 01:25.445
and nothing happened?

01:27.691 --> 01:29.390
Like, at all?

01:29.392 --> 01:31.759
- I didn't even go inside.
- Hold the fuck up!

01:31.761 --> 01:34.862
You got on stage and went all Dej
Nope about my broken pussy for nothing?

01:34.864 --> 01:37.031
Like, all that drama for zero dick?

01:37.033 --> 01:39.867
- Tsk, bitch, you buggin'.
- It wasn't for nothing, though.

01:39.869 --> 01:41.669
Like, it wasn't even about Daniel.

01:41.671 --> 01:43.170
It was about me.

01:43.172 --> 01:45.572
Like, I became someone else up there.

01:45.574 --> 01:47.841
- Mm.
- You know, it was like brave me.

01:47.843 --> 01:49.175
It was "no fucks" me.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.245
And I wanna be that person.

01:51.247 --> 01:52.646
You used to be that person,

01:52.648 --> 01:55.749
all freestyle and drunk
in my backseat and shit.

01:57.018 --> 01:58.452
So, what, you trying to be a rapper now?

01:58.454 --> 02:02.485
No! I just wanna not be
scared to do shit anymore.

02:02.587 --> 02:05.491
Well, you know what? That
sound real cool, real noble,

02:05.493 --> 02:07.293
but can you just leave
my shit out of it?

02:07.295 --> 02:09.828
- You right.
- Okay, thank you!

02:09.830 --> 02:12.732
And I'm really sorry for
saying your pussy's broken.

02:12.734 --> 02:14.533
- You know, I was just talking.
- No, no, no, shut up.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.202
You was right, my pussy is broken

02:17.204 --> 02:18.836
and I need to take better care of her.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.406
So, I'm gonna get her a tune-up.

02:22.442 --> 02:23.608
A tune-up?

02:23.610 --> 02:25.477
Like, she needs her oil changed?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.979
Like, your pussy gonna
pass a smog check or...?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.381
Shut the fuck up.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.249
- I'ma get her fixed.
- How, Sway?

02:31.251 --> 02:34.685
I'm making today Molly Maintenance Day.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.220
I'ma get my hair done, nails done,

02:37.222 --> 02:38.756
everything did.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.424
Ooh, like a fancy day!

02:40.426 --> 02:42.025
Basically, yeah.

02:42.027 --> 02:44.595
If I'm feeling fancy and well
taken care of, so will she.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.096
- That makes sense.
- Right?

02:46.098 --> 02:49.065
Yo, Issa, you got
Lawrence calling me now.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.734
What? Just... just ignore it.

- Wrence!

03:15.526 --> 03:16.758
- About time.
- Yo!

03:16.760 --> 03:18.493
Hey, who all is there?

03:18.495 --> 03:20.329
Oh, Fast Mike and Brandon. Where you at?

03:20.331 --> 03:22.331
Man, Pasadena is far as fuck.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.199
Nigga, it's only, like, four freeways.

03:24.201 --> 03:26.600
- Grab me a Guinness, B.
- I got you.

03:26.602 --> 03:28.869
Yo, bro,

03:28.871 --> 03:30.838
Fast Mike got fat as fuck.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.374
I wanna call him Slow Mike, but you
know how sensitive that nigga get.

03:33.376 --> 03:34.475
Ah.

03:34.477 --> 03:35.976
What's good with you, man?

03:35.978 --> 03:37.277
Aw, shit is up right now, money.

03:37.279 --> 03:38.946
I sold a house to Tiger earlier, man.

03:38.948 --> 03:40.781
I was starstruck, tap
dancing for his ass and shit.

03:40.783 --> 03:42.482
That nigga swole as fuck.
Commission was crazy.

03:42.484 --> 03:44.317
- Oh, that's cool.
- What's up with you, man?

03:44.319 --> 03:46.052
How's that new project
going, the Whoopty-Whoop?

03:46.054 --> 03:48.154
- It's Whoop-Whoop.
- What'd I say?

03:48.156 --> 03:50.457
Still working on my business plan, man.

03:50.459 --> 03:52.091
Plus, you know, there's
so many apps out there now,

03:52.093 --> 03:53.693
it's hard to break into the market.

03:53.695 --> 03:56.128
Am I going too broad, do
I need to be more specific?

03:56.130 --> 03:58.365
- It's just a lot, you know?
- Cool, cool.

03:58.367 --> 04:01.099
That's what's up, man. Hey, I'ma
be selling you a house soon, fam.

04:01.101 --> 04:03.369
- How are you and the old girl?
- Issa's cool.

04:03.371 --> 04:04.970
She, um...

04:06.674 --> 04:08.674
I kind of fucked up her birthday, man.

04:08.676 --> 04:10.409
Aw, damn, man, you gotta fix that.

04:10.411 --> 04:12.177
But other than that, you good, right?

04:12.179 --> 04:14.212
Uh, actually, man,

04:14.214 --> 04:16.547
I was calling 'cause I just wanted to...

04:16.548 --> 04:18.949
Oh, shit, this motherfucker
hit a three, bro.

04:18.951 --> 04:21.810
Hey, man, let me finish the rest of
this game. I'ma shout at you, all right?

04:21.834 --> 04:23.536
Yeah, all right. All right, cool.

04:23.561 --> 04:25.241
I can't hear you. I
was on the phone, girl.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.906
You getting a pedicure?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.741
Mm, I probably should.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.510
Ooh, girl.

04:46.512 --> 04:48.311
Lawrence ever suck your toes?

04:48.313 --> 04:50.313
Once, but it made us both uncomfortable.

04:50.315 --> 04:53.716
Ugh, he was sucking on
your big old man feet?

04:53.718 --> 04:55.866
Girl, I tell ya, that nigga is the one.

04:55.891 --> 04:58.311
Or someone else might be.

04:59.490 --> 05:00.723
What are you talking about?

05:00.725 --> 05:02.024
I like Lawrence.

05:02.026 --> 05:05.494
Bitch, I love him, but...

05:05.496 --> 05:07.529
I mean, maybe I'm not satisfied.

05:07.531 --> 05:10.665
You know? Maybe I wanna
be dicked down properly.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.200
You know? Maybe I wanna be face down,

05:13.202 --> 05:16.504
ass up, surrounded by
foreign freaks, you know?

05:16.506 --> 05:19.006
Maybe I wanna ask a nigga
what he wants for breakfast

05:19.008 --> 05:21.208
and he replies, "That pussy,"

05:21.210 --> 05:22.844
and he's talking about me, girl.

05:22.846 --> 05:25.312
- You know?
- I can't with you. Mm-mm.

05:26.615 --> 05:28.449
You don't know.

05:31.119 --> 05:32.719
I'm just saying

05:32.721 --> 05:35.923
Lawrence hasn't put it down
in a very long time, okay?

05:35.925 --> 05:38.759
And maybe I need to get on one
of those apps like you, girl.

05:38.761 --> 05:41.127
Girl, calm your deprived ass down.

05:41.129 --> 05:42.762
You are not about this app life.

05:42.764 --> 05:44.597
Try me.

05:44.599 --> 05:47.500
Bitch, I'm not gonna sign up. I
just wanna see what's out there.

05:48.903 --> 05:51.103
All right. You asked for it.

05:51.105 --> 05:53.439
Check it, that's OkCupid.

05:53.441 --> 05:56.676
It's free, so it's like
"bottom of the barrel" dudes.

05:56.678 --> 05:58.710
Bought a bunch of new
movies at the barbershop.

05:58.712 --> 06:00.612
Bootleg and chill?

06:02.349 --> 06:03.482
Tinder used to be cool,

06:03.484 --> 06:05.684
but now it's basically a fuck app.

06:05.686 --> 06:07.686
So, what are you in the mood for?

06:07.688 --> 06:09.053
We could ditch the menus

06:09.055 --> 06:10.789
and have our own dinner for two.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.991
Heh, I'll be six, you'll be nine.

06:14.862 --> 06:17.027
Hinge at least pulls from
your network of friends,

06:17.029 --> 06:20.230
but apparently all my friends
only know Hotep niggas.

06:20.232 --> 06:21.832
Uh-uh, no.

06:21.834 --> 06:25.636
I just want a queen that respects
herself, who lays off the swine,

06:25.638 --> 06:29.607
who stands beside her king like
a strong black woman should.

06:29.609 --> 06:30.808
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:30.810 --> 06:33.442
But my queen gotta be a freak, too.

06:35.580 --> 06:37.346
I fucked that nigga 'cause he was fine.

06:37.348 --> 06:39.816
But then he had the nerve to dump me

06:39.818 --> 06:42.218
'cause I told him I never
went to the beach till college.

06:42.220 --> 06:46.389
Nigga, you sell Obama puzzles
at the African marketplace

06:46.391 --> 06:48.391
and you gonna judge me?

06:48.393 --> 06:52.828
You grew up in LA and you
never went to the beach?

06:52.830 --> 06:55.697
Okay, Windsor Hills, I was a hood rat.

06:55.699 --> 06:58.667
All I knew was Florence and
Crenshaw. Whatever, I am still fly.

06:58.669 --> 07:02.838
Basically, most of these dudes
are not looking for a relationship.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.040
- They're just trying to fuck.
- Really?

07:05.042 --> 07:06.474
Yep.

07:06.476 --> 07:09.043
I mean, I just wanna up the
quality of dudes that I meet.

07:09.045 --> 07:11.211
There's this one app called The League.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.613
It's for elite dating.

07:12.615 --> 07:14.749
Like, girl, you gotta be a
professional just to get in.

07:14.751 --> 07:16.918
I mean, I've been on, like,
a three-month waiting list.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.285
Three months?

07:18.287 --> 07:20.054
To meet one nigga?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.790
Yeah, this is a lot.

07:23.792 --> 07:26.359
You gotta fuck a lot of
frogs to get a good frog.

07:26.361 --> 07:29.563
That's not the saying. Or any saying.

07:29.565 --> 07:31.765
The point is it's a numbers game.

07:31.767 --> 07:34.901
Check it, I'm going on a
date with this frog tomorrow.

07:34.903 --> 07:37.403
- Mm.
- He could be different.

07:38.674 --> 07:40.706
- You never know.
- Mm.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.675
So, what we doing next?

07:42.677 --> 07:45.444
I gotta get my hair done
and then something else.

07:45.446 --> 07:47.345
What?

07:47.347 --> 07:49.815
It's a "vagacial" appointment.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.217
It's like a facial for your vagina.

07:52.219 --> 07:54.053
- I said everything did.
- Mm.

07:54.055 --> 07:55.888
I saw it on Draya's Instagram.

07:57.891 --> 08:00.558
I mean, you could roll if you want to.

08:02.448 --> 08:07.164
Fuck! I guess I'll go home and deal
with this motherfucking relationship.

08:07.166 --> 08:09.266
You should write Hallmark cards.

08:09.268 --> 08:11.402
Bitch, shut up.

08:13.039 --> 08:14.238
I'll see you later.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.573
Go handle your man, girl.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.221
Do you know who you are?
You the bossiest bitch.

08:31.223 --> 08:33.722
You a grown-ass woman
like Solange's sis.

08:33.725 --> 08:36.491
You gonna take control like
Janet, or lose control like Missy.

08:36.494 --> 08:40.229
The decision is yours...
boss up or be a pussy.

08:45.536 --> 08:46.969
Mm-mm, no.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.615
- I've been calling you.
- Oh, I... I...

09:36.617 --> 09:38.651

09:42.622 --> 09:44.056
Why are you buying a six pack?

09:44.058 --> 09:46.892
It's cheaper and it's not
like it's the cute kind.

09:46.894 --> 09:48.493
Wait, are you not coming home?

09:48.495 --> 09:50.295

09:54.437 --> 09:56.867
Lawrence, we are not about to be the
black couple fighting in Rite Aid.

09:56.869 --> 09:59.870
Okay, listen, I know that this

09:59.872 --> 10:01.572

10:05.444 --> 10:07.878
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Wait, Is-Issa!

10:13.952 --> 10:16.186
Lawrence, wait.

10:18.566 --> 10:22.092
Can I get your Rite Aid
card for the discount?

10:23.128 --> 10:24.994
Come on, man.

10:34.338 --> 10:36.605
I men and women.

10:36.607 --> 10:39.007
I got two bitches
waiting on me outside...

10:40.444 --> 10:42.911
and two counts of murder on my head

10:42.913 --> 10:45.447
that they know about.

And I ain't sorry.

10:52.188 --> 10:54.889
Girl, hey! Look at you.

10:54.891 --> 10:57.291
Uh, how was your "vagacial"?

10:57.293 --> 11:00.594
This bitch blew bubbles at
me. My pussy is still broken.

11:00.596 --> 11:02.897
At least I have an icebreaker
for my date tomorrow night.

11:02.899 --> 11:05.132
But what are you still doing here?

11:05.134 --> 11:06.833
I thought Miss No Fucks was going home.

11:06.835 --> 11:08.601
Um, can I stay one more night?

11:08.603 --> 11:11.104
Flavor Flav said yes already.

11:11.106 --> 11:13.807
Issa, what's going on? Why
are you avoiding Lawrence?

11:16.411 --> 11:18.078
I kissed Daniel.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.679
But it was like... it was like...

11:19.681 --> 11:22.414
And then it was... and
then it was finished.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.884
Bitch, I knew it with
your old lying ass.

11:24.886 --> 11:26.618
Okay, I did not lie,

11:26.620 --> 11:30.289
because, technically, I did
not go inside or fuck him.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.324
That's a sound defense.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.262
And I saw Lawrence

11:36.264 --> 11:39.397
and, girl, he just doesn't get it.

11:39.399 --> 11:43.168
And I don't know what to do
and I'm just... I'm tired.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.703
Stay as long as you need.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.471
Thank you.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.608
And just so we're clear,
I'm still Miss No Fucks.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.144
It's a... it's a whole
process. It's a thing, so...

11:53.146 --> 11:54.279
Yeah.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.013
How's your presentation going?

11:56.015 --> 11:58.115
Girl, I got too much on my mind, okay?

11:58.117 --> 12:01.785
I am about to just wing
this shit "no fucks" style.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.621
And these white people, they're
not even gonna know the difference.

12:04.623 --> 12:06.456
They're not gonna know!

12:06.458 --> 12:08.591
You're so stupid.

12:08.593 --> 12:10.727
Oh, can I borrow some
clothes for work tomorrow?

12:24.843 --> 12:26.843
_

12:26.845 --> 12:28.610
Boy, bye. Nope!

12:32.449 --> 12:34.415
Um, blazer twins.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.885
Look at that.

12:36.887 --> 12:39.087
Hey, I'm so glad you came in early.

12:39.089 --> 12:42.891
So, about our youth... your
youth outreach initiative,

12:42.893 --> 12:44.159
um, did you get my email?

12:44.161 --> 12:46.794
Oh, no, I had a lot to do this weekend.

12:46.796 --> 12:48.929
Well, I don't wanna step on your toes,

12:48.931 --> 12:52.766
but I spoke to some of the
teachers at Thomas Jefferson

12:52.768 --> 12:57.137
and it turns out the students
have a high interest in sports.

12:57.139 --> 13:00.440
Sports? That's not exactly
outside of what they know,

13:00.442 --> 13:03.377
and don't you think
that's extremely limiting?

13:03.379 --> 13:05.011
No, I hear you.

13:05.013 --> 13:07.180
That is sadly stereotypical.

13:07.182 --> 13:12.051
But to your general point about exposing
them to new and untraditional things,

13:12.053 --> 13:16.289
what about partnering with
USC for sports like lacrosse,

13:16.291 --> 13:20.526
water polo, or even real polo?

13:20.528 --> 13:23.903
I don't... Culturally
speaking, I just...

13:24.817 --> 13:26.696
It's crippling for inner city kids

13:26.721 --> 13:29.415
to rely solely on sports
to achieve success...

13:29.440 --> 13:32.070
- you know?
- That's true.

13:32.072 --> 13:35.407
Well, my other idea was to take
them to different neighborhoods

13:35.409 --> 13:36.942
and to do a community cleanup.

13:38.912 --> 13:41.412
You mean take a bunch of black kids

13:41.414 --> 13:45.149
and have them clean up the
streets like a chain gang?

13:45.151 --> 13:48.886
That's the whitest
shit you've ever said!

13:48.888 --> 13:50.654
You know, community service is cool,

13:50.656 --> 13:52.957
but I think I found my stride.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.625
- I've got this.
- Okay.

13:54.627 --> 13:57.193
- Thank you, though.
- Thank you.

13:57.195 --> 13:59.462
Guys, I've been doing this a long time,

13:59.464 --> 14:02.032
but I still get excited when
my staff takes initiative

14:02.034 --> 14:04.534
to maximize their
impact in the classroom.

14:04.536 --> 14:07.003
Issa, Frieda, the floor is yours.

14:07.005 --> 14:08.671
Thank you, Joanne.

14:08.673 --> 14:12.207
Ahem, so the kids of Thomas
Jefferson Middle School

14:12.209 --> 14:15.510
are stagnant because they don't
know what else is out there.

14:15.512 --> 14:20.482
So, my idea is to expose them

14:20.484 --> 14:23.718
to the arts around Los Angeles.

14:25.957 --> 14:27.456
Which arts?

14:28.792 --> 14:31.625
Uh, all of them.

14:31.627 --> 14:33.227
Are you referring to, like, visual arts,

14:33.229 --> 14:36.364
theatrical arts, or did you
really just mean the arts?

14:36.366 --> 14:39.600
Um, what I'm asking is, is that it?

14:39.602 --> 14:42.303
No, that's... uh-uh, that's not it.

14:42.305 --> 14:45.906
Um, if they're interested
in painting and sculpture,

14:45.908 --> 14:47.907
we can take them to The Broad.

14:47.909 --> 14:49.242
If they like music,

14:49.244 --> 14:50.810
we can take them to the Hollywood Bowl.

14:50.812 --> 14:52.579
There's the Watts Towers...

14:52.581 --> 14:54.747
Have you put together a budget on this?

14:54.749 --> 14:58.018
- That sounds expensive.
- It does, right?

14:58.020 --> 15:01.588
No, I was gonna get people
excited about it first

15:01.590 --> 15:03.856
and then I was gonna
take a stab at the budget.

15:03.858 --> 15:05.624
A stab?

15:05.626 --> 15:09.862
So, you have really no idea how
much this is gonna cost at all?

15:09.864 --> 15:13.265
This sounds like a whole lot
of work for very little benefit.

15:13.267 --> 15:14.900
I see where you're going with this,

15:14.902 --> 15:17.470
but have you thought
about the risk factors,

15:17.472 --> 15:20.605
the executions, how
is it mission-driven?

15:20.607 --> 15:23.908
Uh, the... the mission would be... help.

15:23.910 --> 15:27.078
We were also considering a
community service component

15:27.080 --> 15:28.446
- which I...
- Not yet, Frieda.

15:28.448 --> 15:31.102
- This is Issa's idea. Let her finish.
- Okay.

15:31.127 --> 15:33.985
Yeah, no, uh, a community
service component

15:33.987 --> 15:37.054
could also be included, um...

15:38.157 --> 15:39.890
Culturally, I'm just like...

15:39.892 --> 15:43.460
Wouldn't they rather go to
an African American museum

15:43.462 --> 15:45.029
or, like, a Latino museum

15:45.031 --> 15:47.464
and just see how much more
grateful other generations were?

15:47.466 --> 15:50.467
Oh, my God, what about
hip-hop Shakespeare?

15:50.469 --> 15:52.169
The kids would love "Othello."

15:52.171 --> 15:53.370
An interracial romance.

15:53.372 --> 15:55.505
Ooh, what about a drum circle?

15:55.507 --> 15:57.073
That really helps with aggression.

15:57.075 --> 15:58.974
I took an African dance
class in high school,

15:58.976 --> 16:00.443
so I could do mask work with the kids.

16:00.445 --> 16:02.145
We watch "Lemonade"

16:02.147 --> 16:04.847
and then we go to Lemonade and we eat.

16:04.849 --> 16:07.383
We eat good food that's good for you

16:07.385 --> 16:09.085
and we see art.

16:13.424 --> 16:15.357
Can I have a few minutes, please?

16:19.863 --> 16:21.696
Everyone,

16:21.698 --> 16:25.067
let's reconvene at the end of the day.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.465
Yes, but when the plaintiff
took this job, he signed a waiver

16:36.489 --> 16:38.580
that completely indemnifies our client

16:38.582 --> 16:42.049
of any and all risks associated
with operating heavy machinery.

16:42.713 --> 16:44.718
You are so fucking smart.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.920
I'll keep reviewing
the employment contract.

16:47.922 --> 16:49.855
Sorry to interrupt.

16:49.857 --> 16:51.257
- Hey.
- Molly, good points today.

16:51.259 --> 16:52.959
Oh, thank you, 'cause, you
know, actually, I was...

16:52.961 --> 16:54.494
Diane, I never got a chance

16:54.496 --> 16:57.497
to formally congratulate
you on your engagement.

16:57.499 --> 16:59.432
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:59.434 --> 17:01.234
Wedding planning is the most stressful.

17:01.236 --> 17:02.867
My wife and I went crazy.

17:02.869 --> 17:05.436
- Are you going crazy yet?
- You know, I am going crazy

17:05.439 --> 17:07.239
with all this work we have to do.

17:07.241 --> 17:09.007
Oh, my God,

17:09.009 --> 17:10.909
I haven't even thought about
the wedding yet, you guys.

17:10.911 --> 17:12.544
It's, like, only been a few days.

17:12.546 --> 17:14.579
- Did you see the ring?
- Oh!

17:14.582 --> 17:16.815
- Well, there it is. Wow.
- It's a princess cut.

17:16.817 --> 17:18.550
- That is a diamond.
- Look at mine.

17:18.551 --> 17:19.916
- Look at that.
- Mm-hmm.

17:22.821 --> 17:26.124
- Come in.
- Hey.

17:26.126 --> 17:29.827
Um, so, I'm sorry about
the presentation today.

17:29.829 --> 17:33.331
- I know you were expecting more.
- I was.

17:33.333 --> 17:36.366
Um, and I just wanna let you know

17:36.368 --> 17:39.702
that I am fully committed to
and invested in We Got Y'all.

17:39.704 --> 17:42.139
- I've just had a lot...
- Let me stop you right there.

17:42.141 --> 17:45.408
- You're not.
- Um, sorry?

17:45.410 --> 17:49.846
I hired you because I saw someone
who wanted to make a difference.

17:49.848 --> 17:51.648
You seemed passionate at first,

17:51.650 --> 17:55.117
but I've noticed you've been
on autopilot for a while now.

17:55.963 --> 17:57.763
If you don't wanna do the work,

17:57.788 --> 18:01.857
if you're no longer invested
in what we're trying to do here,

18:01.859 --> 18:04.267
maybe this isn't the
right place for you.

18:05.129 --> 18:07.829
No, it... no, it is!

18:07.831 --> 18:09.765
And you're right.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.233
I... I wanna be here.

18:12.235 --> 18:14.802
And I will do better.

18:16.339 --> 18:19.006
The leader who does not take advice

18:19.008 --> 18:20.575
is not a leader.

18:22.579 --> 18:26.381
That's a proverb from
Kenya, date unknown.

18:26.383 --> 18:28.482
Okay.

- No.
- Talk to me, blood.

19:37.215 --> 19:39.249
Me and Nala was just about
to go watch the "Bare Bears."

19:39.251 --> 19:41.851
- "Care Bears," Daddy.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

19:41.853 --> 19:43.886
We don't use no C-word, sweetheart.

19:43.888 --> 19:45.955
This is a blood house.

19:45.957 --> 19:47.557
Are you sure you're "bool," man?

19:50.295 --> 19:52.021
I've just been messing up.

19:52.046 --> 19:54.396
I started this business
that didn't pan out.

19:54.398 --> 19:57.332
Now I'm watching all my
friends just pass me by.

19:57.334 --> 19:59.701
It's just been
frustrating on all levels.

19:59.703 --> 20:01.637
Yeah, a nigga's stuck.

20:01.639 --> 20:03.204
Yeah.

20:03.206 --> 20:04.573
You ain't working, you ain't providing.

20:04.575 --> 20:06.174
Shit, you probably ain't
even putting it down.

20:06.176 --> 20:08.042
- Man, hey.
- Nah, nah, no disrespect.

20:08.044 --> 20:09.977
- You love your girl and shit, right?
- Yeah, I do.

20:09.979 --> 20:13.514
I just... I just don't know
how to change things, man.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.615
Well, hear me out.

20:14.617 --> 20:17.851
I used to be out there fucking
bitches, being inconsiderate and shit.

20:17.853 --> 20:20.053
But then when I had Nala, I was like,

20:20.055 --> 20:22.356
"What if she meet a nigga like me?"

20:22.358 --> 20:25.926
I even tried to make it work with
her moms, but her moms is a H-O-E.

20:25.928 --> 20:28.995
- So F-U-C-K her B-I-T-C-H-A-S-S.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

20:30.499 --> 20:32.399
Gotta spell fast. She getting so smart.

20:32.401 --> 20:35.702
She know her ABBs and shit.
That's little Einstein, huh?

20:35.704 --> 20:37.870
Daddy's little Einstein.

20:37.872 --> 20:40.440
Anyway, bling your shit up, blood.

20:43.477 --> 20:46.512
Hey, and if it don't
work out, I got bitches.

20:46.514 --> 20:47.514
Cool.

20:48.616 --> 20:49.782
"Bool."

20:55.690 --> 20:59.057
I completely forgot about
the surveys these kids did.

20:59.096 --> 21:01.336
Yeah, well, they were
still in sealed envelopes.

21:01.361 --> 21:05.330
The voice of the children. You
believe this? It's so telling.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.432
And you were right, they did mostly list

21:07.434 --> 21:10.368
basketball and football
in their interests.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.370
Mostly spelled wrong, but still.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.238
They wanna be part of a team.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.074
Or they wanna take it out the
hood. Look at this question...

21:17.076 --> 21:19.242
"What is something you'd like
We Got Y'all to do next year?"

21:19.244 --> 21:21.878
- This is sad.
- "Take us to the Crenshaw mall."

21:21.880 --> 21:23.680
"Go to Benihana's."

21:23.682 --> 21:25.882
"Dave & Buster's."

21:25.884 --> 21:27.351
"Stand in line for Jordans."

21:27.353 --> 21:29.853
These kids can't even
imagine past the 10 freeway.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.690
No, I'm not... I'm not laughing at...

21:33.692 --> 21:35.691
- That's... that's sad.
- It's sad.

21:35.693 --> 21:37.526
No, my friend grew up around here

21:37.528 --> 21:39.294
and she was talking about how
she never went to the beach

21:39.296 --> 21:40.996
- until college.
- No way.

21:40.998 --> 21:44.032
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

21:44.034 --> 21:46.736
- She's a lawyer, but...
- Okay.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.371
I don't know,

21:48.373 --> 21:50.539
what if we just took these
kids to the beach to start?

21:50.541 --> 21:53.408
You know, we could even do your
service idea and make it a...

21:53.410 --> 21:55.744
Beach cleanup.

21:55.746 --> 21:57.746
Word twins.

21:57.748 --> 21:58.880
Hello.

21:58.882 --> 22:01.750
- It's becoming our thing.
- Mm-mm.

22:06.723 --> 22:08.356
No, no, no, look,

22:08.358 --> 22:10.491
hands down, the worst
dating experience I've had...

22:10.493 --> 22:13.026
- Coffee Meets Bagel.
- Wait, worse than OkCupid?

22:13.028 --> 22:16.430
Listen, I've never had so
many women eyeing my shoe size

22:16.432 --> 22:18.131
and asking me, "So,
are the rumors true?"

22:18.133 --> 22:20.967
- Wait, about your...?
- Uh-huh.

22:20.969 --> 22:23.504
Yep, white girls have no shame.

22:23.506 --> 22:25.772
Oh, so you mostly date white girls?

22:25.774 --> 22:27.907
Not at all. I just
went through this period

22:27.909 --> 22:31.010
- where black women weren't feeling me.
- Now I know you lying.

22:31.012 --> 22:33.579
No, no, no, listen, you're
the first black woman

22:33.581 --> 22:35.014
who's responded to me in a minute.

22:35.016 --> 22:36.982
- I don't know what it is.
- Really?

22:36.984 --> 22:38.183
Really.

22:38.185 --> 22:39.752
Wow.

22:39.754 --> 22:42.021
You two, okay?

22:42.023 --> 22:45.123
You want some more wine
or are you in a rush?

22:45.125 --> 22:47.459
Sure, no rush here.

22:47.461 --> 22:49.260
Can we have your Argentinian Malbec?

22:49.262 --> 22:51.663
- Okay.
- Thanks, man. You're gonna like this.

22:51.665 --> 22:52.964
- Oh, am I?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:52.966 --> 22:54.566
Am I gonna like it like
I like your chicken?

22:54.568 --> 22:55.734
Uh, I mean, you know...

22:55.736 --> 22:57.502
- I mean, just a taste!
- You got pasta.

23:06.879 --> 23:08.712
- This was fun.
- Yeah!

23:08.714 --> 23:10.514
You wanna grab some coffee?

23:10.516 --> 23:12.783
Uh, definitely.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.154
You trying to fuck, though?

23:18.156 --> 23:21.123
- You motherfucker.
- All right.

23:21.125 --> 23:23.793
You think that just 'cause
you know some fancy wine-speak,

23:23.795 --> 23:25.328
I'm just supposed to
let you take me home?

23:25.330 --> 23:27.564
What, three glasses of
Spanish wine means we fuck?

23:27.566 --> 23:29.599
Malbec's Argentinian, but...

23:29.601 --> 23:32.502
I spent all this time trying to
make sure that my pussy is fixed,

23:32.504 --> 23:35.871
but it turns out you are just like
every other single asshole out here.

23:35.873 --> 23:38.774
I didn't break my pussy,
niggas like you broke my pussy.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.107
_

24:01.230 --> 24:02.663
So, I'm home.

24:02.665 --> 24:04.131
You still the same nigga?

24:04.133 --> 24:06.233
"Yep, but who else you gonna be with?"

24:06.235 --> 24:08.134
Oh, I got options, nigga. I got options.

24:08.136 --> 24:10.871
"So, you ready to talk now?"

24:10.873 --> 24:12.806
You ready to man-up now? Ha!

24:12.808 --> 24:15.208
You wasn't expecting
that, huh? That was good.

24:15.210 --> 24:18.111
That's, like, pow. "What's my mama
gonna say about us breaking up?"

24:18.113 --> 24:20.179
I don't give a shit
about your mama, nigga!

24:20.181 --> 24:22.048
She's really nice.

24:22.050 --> 24:25.584
"Where'd you put all my
shit?" In a box to the left.

24:25.586 --> 24:28.253
It's like a jungle sometimes, nigga.

24:28.255 --> 24:29.822
"So, you know I'm
gonna take all my DVDs."

24:29.824 --> 24:32.658
Don't nobody want your
Steve Harvey box set.

24:32.660 --> 24:34.359
"You know I'm still working
on my business plan."

24:34.361 --> 24:36.495
I got a plan... start the business.

24:36.497 --> 24:37.830
Nigga, how 'bout that?

24:37.832 --> 24:40.933
"Bitch you know I love
you." I love you, too.

24:54.648 --> 24:57.882
Hey, broken pussy!

25:01.587 --> 25:03.053
Jared.

25:03.055 --> 25:05.388
- Right, right.
- What's up?

25:05.390 --> 25:07.558
You got... you got a little...

25:07.608 --> 25:10.171
something all over your face.

25:10.335 --> 25:12.495
Okay, so you got jokes.

25:12.497 --> 25:15.198
Somebody runs out of a
club and don't say good-bye.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.667
Yeah.

25:17.669 --> 25:20.436
- Uh, who is this?
- That's Flavor Flav.

25:20.438 --> 25:24.239
Oh, you should get a
Doberman and name him Chuck D.

25:24.241 --> 25:25.641
- Thank you.
- Real clever.

25:25.643 --> 25:27.577
I tried. Did a little something.

26:24.197 --> 26:26.698
Got an interview with
a headhunter tomorrow.

26:27.801 --> 26:29.001
That's great.

26:35.142 --> 26:39.177
I shouldn't have ignored you today.

26:42.515 --> 26:44.882
Thug Yoda spelled an
entire sentence today.

26:46.422 --> 26:47.455
For real?

26:48.937 --> 26:52.071
That's "brazy."
