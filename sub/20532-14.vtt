00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.443 --> 00:12.378
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.380 --> 00:14.780
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.782 --> 00:17.483
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.485 --> 00:19.852
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.854 --> 00:22.454
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.456 --> 00:25.157
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.159 --> 00:29.361
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.363 --> 00:33.465
-¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
-¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.467 --> 00:36.535
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.537 --> 00:37.870
¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:37.872 --> 00:39.405
¶ Making my way ¶

00:39.407 --> 00:42.708
-¶ It's an adventure every day ¶
-¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.710 --> 00:45.344
-¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
-¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.346 --> 00:51.417
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the First ¶

00:59.727 --> 01:01.627
[Sofia reads]

01:04.899 --> 01:06.865
You paying attention,
Princess?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.767
Because inside my hand

01:08.769 --> 01:13.572
is one of the most powerful
Protector tools you'll ever use.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.441
That teeny little key?

01:15.443 --> 01:19.778
This is a Necessi-Key,
and it's a lifesaver.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.915
I can't tell you how many times
I've been running for my life

01:22.917 --> 01:25.017
about to get trampled
by some cyclops,

01:25.019 --> 01:26.585
when I take out
this little number

01:26.587 --> 01:28.754
and instant door!

01:29.690 --> 01:31.223
Amazing!

01:31.225 --> 01:33.292
You can make yourself
a magical door

01:33.294 --> 01:35.894
wherever and whenever
you want!

01:35.896 --> 01:38.764
But it only lasts
a couple of seconds.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.765
Can I try?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.633
Thought you'd never ask!

01:45.206 --> 01:46.972
Before you go through,
you might wanna--!

01:46.974 --> 01:48.240
-Whoa!
-[splashing]

01:48.242 --> 01:49.475
[laughing]

01:49.477 --> 01:52.644
...take a look at what
you're stepping into!

01:52.646 --> 01:54.079
Let me try that again.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.714
Don't worry, Sofia.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.150
Your number-one trainer
will show you how it's done.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.623
Oh, this is ever so unfair!

02:04.625 --> 02:07.559
I'm stuck here with the key
to my escape

02:07.561 --> 02:10.829
so close, but so far!

02:10.831 --> 02:12.731
It's as if
they're taunting me.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.565
[squeaking]

02:13.567 --> 02:15.400
[gasps]

02:15.402 --> 02:16.602
A rat!

02:16.604 --> 02:17.769
[Twitch] Whatcha in for?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.738
A rat that can talk!

02:19.740 --> 02:21.573
That's not all I can do!

02:21.575 --> 02:23.675
What do you think of this?

02:23.677 --> 02:25.744
You like this one?

02:25.746 --> 02:28.680
And check out my favorite!

02:28.682 --> 02:30.282
Ha ha ha!

02:30.284 --> 02:32.684
Who are you,
and what do you want?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.686
I'm Twitch,
and I'm a strangeling,

02:34.688 --> 02:36.855
which means
I can change into any

02:36.857 --> 02:40.292
sneaky little critter
I want. Who are you?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.694
I am Prisma.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.929
Wait a minute!

02:43.931 --> 02:45.764
You can change shape!

02:45.766 --> 02:48.700
Can you turn into something
really tiny?

02:48.702 --> 02:51.103
Oh, yeah, the teeniest!

02:52.540 --> 02:55.541
That's absolutely perfect!

02:55.543 --> 02:59.478
Oh, Twitch, I have
a very big favor to ask of you.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.980
Ask away. I can handle
the biggest favors.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.849
You see that pretty locket
over there

03:03.851 --> 03:06.051
locked up
in that big, mean safe?

03:06.053 --> 03:07.786
Yeah, so?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.988
That's the Locket of Vor,

03:09.990 --> 03:12.691
and it's supposed
to be oh, so powerful.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.459
Its magic might be
powerful enough

03:14.461 --> 03:17.729
to break me out of here!

03:17.731 --> 03:20.632
[Twitch] Mm, it looks like
it's locked up real tight.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.335
It is, but it has
a crystal lock.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.638
My sister and I used to design
crystal locks just like it.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.676
All you need to do is
slip inside the safe's keyhole.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.711
Then I can tell you
how to unlock it.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.646
Why don't I just
unlock your cell?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.982
Ugh! Those
infuriating Protectors

03:36.984 --> 03:38.717
put a metal lock on my cell.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.486
I know nothing
about metal locks.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.590
All right, let's go get
this locket of yours, then.

03:49.930 --> 03:53.765
[Prisma] Inside, you should see
three tiny crystal levers.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.567
Oh, yeah!
They're here.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.770
Push the first one up,
the second one down,

03:58.772 --> 04:00.505
and the last one in.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.311
[tinkling]

04:09.617 --> 04:11.083
[squeaking]

04:17.625 --> 04:20.092
Oh, the Locket of Vor!

04:20.094 --> 04:22.227
Oh, thank you, Twitch!

04:22.229 --> 04:25.097
I promise I'll share
whatever powers it gives me.

04:29.203 --> 04:33.071
At last, I am free.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.707
What powerful creature
has made it so?

04:35.709 --> 04:37.442
Why, that would be me!

04:37.444 --> 04:40.712
But... you have no power.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.714
No need to rub it in!

04:42.716 --> 04:44.716
My power was taken from me!

04:44.718 --> 04:46.985
That's why I need your help
to get out of this tower!

04:46.987 --> 04:50.489
So, go ahead,
work your magic!

04:50.491 --> 04:52.424
I am a piece of jewelry.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.626
I cannot break down walls.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.895
The power I can grant to you

04:56.897 --> 04:59.298
is the power of knowledge.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.732
Go on!

05:00.734 --> 05:05.170
I know where you can find
the Wicked Nine.

05:05.172 --> 05:08.106
The Wicked Nine?!
Are those even real?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.309
Nine powerful magic items

05:10.311 --> 05:13.111
spread across the Mystic Isles
and the EverRealm,

05:13.113 --> 05:18.583
each once used by history's
most devious villains.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.585
That's Jafar's staff!

05:20.587 --> 05:24.156
[gasps] And that's
Ursula's necklace!

05:24.158 --> 05:26.758
There are those who know
where to find one or two

05:26.760 --> 05:28.794
of the Wicked Nine,

05:28.796 --> 05:32.130
but only I know
where to find them all.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.366
And you're going
to tell me, right?

05:34.368 --> 05:37.336
Oh, yes, my dear.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.870
With my help,

05:38.872 --> 05:40.706
you will gather
these precious objects

05:40.708 --> 05:42.507
and bring them to me,

05:42.509 --> 05:45.610
and then we
shall make history.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.512
With a few magic words,

05:47.514 --> 05:49.781
I will harness
all of their power

05:49.783 --> 05:52.184
and give it to you,

05:52.186 --> 05:55.721
a great and mighty
version of you.

05:55.723 --> 05:59.791
Ooh, now that's
a good look for me!

05:59.793 --> 06:01.059
With that kind of power,

06:01.061 --> 06:02.794
I could easily
break out of here!

06:02.796 --> 06:06.732
You will be able
to do far more than that.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.534
Oh, yes! Only...

06:09.536 --> 06:10.802
I can't leave.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.738
I can't get the Wicked Nine.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.840
But your favorite
strangeling can!

06:14.842 --> 06:15.907
Ha ha ha!

06:15.909 --> 06:17.676
[squeaking]

06:17.678 --> 06:19.144
You would do that for me?

06:19.146 --> 06:21.146
Oh, yeah! I've been waiting

06:21.148 --> 06:22.981
for a powerful master
to serve,

06:22.983 --> 06:24.850
and you are it!

06:24.852 --> 06:27.819
Oh, thank you!
Thank you both!

06:27.821 --> 06:32.224
The first of the Wicked Nine
is called the Falcon's Eye.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.860
This gem is hidden
inside a sword

06:34.862 --> 06:37.996
once used
by the wicked warrior Shan Yu

06:37.998 --> 06:40.532
against a hero named Mulan.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.601
The sword can now be found

06:42.603 --> 06:45.003
in the marketplace
of Wei-Ling.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.171
Not for long!

06:46.173 --> 06:47.539
Go, Twitch, go,

06:47.541 --> 06:49.808
and don't come back
without that gem!

06:57.851 --> 06:59.451
Wait! What's
going on here?

06:59.453 --> 07:00.852
The safe's been opened!

07:00.854 --> 07:03.422
The locket!
It's gone!

07:03.424 --> 07:05.924
I don't think she had
anything to do with it.

07:05.926 --> 07:06.892
-[grunts]
-[clanks]

07:06.894 --> 07:08.693
We must alert
the other Protectors!

07:16.603 --> 07:19.271
-Chrysta, Sofia.
-What's up, Chief?

07:19.273 --> 07:21.039
I have bad news to report.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.275
-There's been an escape.
-Not Prisma?!

07:23.277 --> 07:26.411
No. The Locket of Vor.
It's missing.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.980
The locket was sealed up
tight in a safe!

07:28.982 --> 07:30.882
We fear someone
has stolen it

07:30.884 --> 07:33.752
and plans to use it
to track down the Wicked Nine.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.287
What's the Wicked Nine?

07:35.289 --> 07:38.723
Powerful objects
that were once used
by big-time villains.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.492
If all nine
are brought together,

07:40.494 --> 07:43.261
they can give the owner
unspeakable power.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.630
We only know
where some of the nine are.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.966
We're sending Protectors
to stand guard over those

07:47.968 --> 07:50.602
and to catch anyone
who tries to steal them.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.270
Looks like today
I'm gonna show you

07:52.272 --> 07:54.005
how Protectors
catch a bad guy.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.241
Great. So, which one
are we guarding?

07:56.243 --> 07:58.276
The Falcon's Eye
in Wei-Ling.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.946
<i> It's a gem hidden</i>
<i> inside this sword.</i>

08:00.948 --> 08:03.281
I know Wei-Ling!
My friends live there.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.852
Go quickly,
and keep the Falcon's Eye safe.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.960
Is it always
this crowded?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.628
It must be market day.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.264
They hold one here
at the palace once a month.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.803
[gasps] That's
where the sword is!

08:24.805 --> 08:26.505
We found it, all right!

08:26.507 --> 08:28.106
Now we gotta make sure
we catch anyone

08:28.108 --> 08:29.174
who tries to steal it!

08:29.176 --> 08:32.110
[squeaking]

08:32.112 --> 08:34.479
[gasps] They've
got Enchantlets!

08:34.481 --> 08:36.615
They must be Protectors.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.950
Oh, I gotta make sure
they don't spot me.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.019
[squeaking]

08:41.021 --> 08:42.821
[Chrysta] I've seen
pedestals like this

08:42.823 --> 08:44.623
that hold
valuable objects.

08:44.625 --> 08:48.193
They almost always have
some sort of booby trap
built in.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.009
Ah-ha! I knew it!

09:04.011 --> 09:06.978
All we have to do
is set the trap...

09:06.980 --> 09:10.015
And whoever tries to steal
the sword will fall right in!

09:10.017 --> 09:12.183
That's incredible, Chrysta!

09:12.185 --> 09:15.420
[gasps] I know something else
we can do to catch the thief--

09:15.422 --> 09:17.055
ask my friends for help!

09:17.057 --> 09:19.024
Jun! Jin! Over here!

09:19.026 --> 09:20.892
[Chrysta]
What are you doing?

09:20.894 --> 09:21.893
Hi, Sofia.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.895
Sorry.
Where are my manners?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.565
Chrysta, this is
Jun and Jin.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.099
We're on the lookout
for a thief!

09:28.101 --> 09:30.735
-Shh!
-Oh, right.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.406
Someone might be trying to steal
an important jewel, and--

09:34.408 --> 09:37.943
Sofia! You can't just tell
these kids what we're doing!

09:37.945 --> 09:39.110
These aren't just any kids.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.879
They're my friends,

09:40.881 --> 09:42.414
and they might
be able to help.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.849
Yeah, we know everyone
in Wei-Ling.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.419
Thank you, but this is
Protector business.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.188
I don't see how them helping us
could be a bad thing.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.557
Princess? Who here
is the trainee?

09:52.559 --> 09:53.558
Me.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.027
And who is the trainer?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.862
[sighs] You are.

09:57.864 --> 10:01.066
Uh, sorry, guys,
but I think you better go.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.034
Okay. Let us know
if you change your mind.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.637
We're around if you decide
you need help.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.406
Sorry about that, Sofia,
but we gotta stay focused.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.808
Come on. Follow me.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.143
Gather round, everyone!

10:12.145 --> 10:13.778
Who is this character?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.381
That's Kai. He's one
of my friends, too.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.784
Time for a one-panda
dance party. Go Kai! Go Kai!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.953
Of course he is.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.221
Now's my chance!

10:23.223 --> 10:25.223
Go Kai! Go Kai!

10:25.225 --> 10:30.161
Ah-ha! Princess, I found us
the perfect hiding spot.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.064
It offers plenty of cover
so we won't be seen,

10:33.066 --> 10:35.133
and it's got a great view
of the sword

10:35.135 --> 10:37.068
so we can see
who's coming and going.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.770
Go Kai! Go Kai!

10:38.772 --> 10:41.172
That is, it would've
been a great view

10:41.174 --> 10:43.642
if it wasn't being blocked
by a dancing panda!

10:43.644 --> 10:45.176
I'll go ask him to move.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.444
Oh, and Princess,

10:46.446 --> 10:48.346
please don't invite him
to help us.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.248
I won't,
I promise.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.783
Go Kai! Go Kai!

10:51.785 --> 10:54.085
Hi, Kai!
Nice dance moves.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.755
Princess Sofia!

10:56.757 --> 11:00.325
Oh, how I have missed you!

11:00.327 --> 11:02.093
Mwah mwah mwah.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.429
Oh... thanks.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.864
I missed you, too.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.832
It's just right now
my friend Chrysta and I

11:07.834 --> 11:10.135
are doing
a little project...

11:10.137 --> 11:12.504
Ooh, what kind of project?

11:12.506 --> 11:15.040
Um, I can't really
tell you right now.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.509
But maybe I can ¶ help ¶.

11:17.511 --> 11:21.513
Uh, I'm sure you could,
but the thing is...

11:21.515 --> 11:23.682
It's something we need
to do on our own.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.384
And if you could dance
just a little to the side...

11:26.386 --> 11:30.522
over there... that would
really help us out.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.023
I can do that...

11:32.025 --> 11:34.025
and keep a beat
at the same time!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.827
Thanks, Kai,
you're the best.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.195
Later, Sofia!

11:37.197 --> 11:39.864
I love market day!

11:39.866 --> 11:41.299
So many people!

11:41.301 --> 11:43.068
So many dances
to do for them!

11:44.871 --> 11:48.006
That's right, don't get help
from that dancing fool.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.174
[chuckles] The less people

11:49.176 --> 11:51.876
on the lookout for me,
the better.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.178
[squeaks]

11:53.180 --> 11:55.380
Don't worry, I didn't
tell Kai anything

11:55.382 --> 11:57.015
about protecting
the Wicked Nine,

11:57.017 --> 11:59.117
and we should have
a clear view now.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.321
Look!

12:03.323 --> 12:04.556
Let's go!

12:07.327 --> 12:10.128
Now, let's see
who our jewel thief is.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.565
-A skunk!
-[chitters]

12:13.567 --> 12:16.000
You don't think it could be
trying to steal the sword?

12:16.002 --> 12:19.437
No, but as you
can see, Sofia,

12:19.439 --> 12:22.907
there are always surprises
when you're on a job.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.242
That was a close one.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.778
I gotta create
some kind of diversion

12:26.780 --> 12:29.247
so I can do
my sneaking in peace.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.950
Chrysta, what should we
be keeping an eye out for?

12:31.952 --> 12:35.220
Some kind of wicked wizard
or warrior,

12:35.222 --> 12:38.356
and probably wearing
the stolen Locket of Vor.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.559
So, they're looking for
a bad guy wearing a locket.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.728
I think I can
give them that.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.364
[squeaking]

12:46.366 --> 12:49.901
Rings! Bracelets!
Lockets!

12:49.903 --> 12:52.203
All the finest quality!

12:52.205 --> 12:55.874
Finest quality?
Not so sure about that,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.442
but they'll do.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.210
[squeaking]

13:06.620 --> 13:09.287
[sniffing]

13:22.936 --> 13:24.736
Just keep
your eyes peeled,

13:24.738 --> 13:26.237
and if a thief shows up,

13:26.239 --> 13:28.173
we'll be ready!

13:28.175 --> 13:29.607
[gasps] Sofia, look!

13:29.609 --> 13:31.242
He's wearing a locket!

13:31.244 --> 13:33.344
And he's headed
toward the sword!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.180
Stop that man!

13:35.182 --> 13:37.415
He's a thief!

13:37.417 --> 13:39.250
Hold it right there!

13:39.252 --> 13:42.153
[gasps] Emperor Quon?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.423
Ah, Princess Sofia,
how nice to see you.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.826
Oh, I'm so sorry
to bother you, Emperor Quon.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.994
I didn't recognize you.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.263
Please, do not apologize!

13:52.265 --> 13:55.633
I always enjoy a quiet walk
through the market.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.436
You never know
what you will come across.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.705
Why, just now, I have found

14:00.707 --> 14:03.842
this beautiful medallion
on the ground,

14:03.844 --> 14:06.878
and you know what they say
about finding medallions
on the ground--

14:06.880 --> 14:10.815
hang them from your neck
and enjoy many compliments.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.450
It's lovely.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.219
Well, I'm off to enjoy

14:14.221 --> 14:16.321
the many compliments
coming my way.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.956
Sorry! False alarm!

14:17.958 --> 14:19.557
Nothing to see here.
Move along.

14:38.411 --> 14:42.213
Hmm. A rat holding a gem.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.315
You don't see that every day.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.519
And you really don't see
that every day.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.655
[panting] Okay.
Flying out of here

14:50.657 --> 14:54.092
with this heavy gem
is not gonna work.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.261
Good thing I got
a million other plans.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.598
[chittering]

15:00.600 --> 15:02.000
There is no way
the Emperor

15:02.002 --> 15:03.568
could be trying
to steal the gem.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.370
We made
a mistake, Chrysta.

15:05.372 --> 15:09.440
Maybe, or somebody wanted us
to think he was the thief

15:09.442 --> 15:12.510
so we would be distracted
while they-- [gasps]

15:14.381 --> 15:16.381
Someone's tampered with it!

15:16.383 --> 15:17.882
Did they get the gem?

15:17.884 --> 15:20.084
Yes! And I don't see
any footprints,

15:20.086 --> 15:21.552
just animal tracks!

15:21.554 --> 15:25.123
Well, that's
because an animal took it.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.524
[laughing]

15:26.526 --> 15:29.394
It was the craziest thing!

15:29.396 --> 15:31.963
A rat running around
with a gem?

15:31.965 --> 15:33.965
Why didn't you stop him?!

15:33.967 --> 15:36.134
Huh? Was I supposed to?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.903
Yes! That's the whole reason
we're here!

15:38.905 --> 15:40.438
To stop a jewel thief!

15:40.440 --> 15:42.073
Well, I didn't
know that.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.742
I was going to tell you,
but my trainer wouldn't let me.

15:44.744 --> 15:48.313
Well, all right,
maybe I should've listened
to you about that.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.214
Tell us more
about this rat!

15:50.216 --> 15:55.086
Ooh. He had
a cool diamond pattern
on his chest.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.423
[gasps] We saw the same thing
on that skunk!

15:58.425 --> 16:00.124
And he still had it

16:00.126 --> 16:02.393
when he turned into
a bat and flew away.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.329
The rat turned
into a bat?

16:04.331 --> 16:05.663
Uh-huh.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.733
And it was probably
that skunk, too!

16:08.735 --> 16:11.169
I think we got ourselves
a strangeling!

16:11.171 --> 16:12.770
-A what?
-Ugh.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.440
It's a nasty little critter
from the Mystic Isles.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.408
It can change
into different animals.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.010
Which way did it go, Kai?

16:19.012 --> 16:20.578
That way.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.348
A strangeling is going
to be impossible to find!

16:23.350 --> 16:26.017
It could be anywhere!
Or anything.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.586
Well, maybe if I get
my friends, we could--

16:28.588 --> 16:30.421
Ah, never mind. Forget it.

16:35.261 --> 16:40.198
Now, Sofia, I should be
listening to you.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.933
I thought
since I was the trainer,

16:41.935 --> 16:44.969
I could be the only one
with good ideas,

16:44.971 --> 16:47.038
but it's time
to listen to yours.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.440
In fact, you wanna
help us, big guy?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.275
Absolutely.
What's the plan?

16:51.277 --> 16:55.613
-Sofia?
-Let's start by getting
more backup.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.282
Okay, does everyone
know their part?

16:58.284 --> 17:00.518
I search the gardens
while you search the market.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.787
And I give Kai
an overhead view.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.823
And if anyone sees
an animal holding a gem...

17:05.825 --> 17:07.825
Give a shout
and alert the others!

17:07.827 --> 17:12.130
Right! That means
we all gotta listen up!

gonna happen!

19:21.594 --> 19:24.795
It's too tall!
I can't--

19:24.797 --> 19:26.531
Yes, I can!

19:32.005 --> 19:33.771
You think you can stop me?

19:33.773 --> 19:37.341
I'm the greatest,

No!

19:51.824 --> 19:54.559

19:54.561 --> 19:57.695
Apparently not
the greatest or the fastest,

19:57.697 --> 20:00.097
but I am the sneakiest!

20:05.672 --> 20:06.637
Ha ha ha ha!

20:06.639 --> 20:08.105
Come back!

20:12.478 --> 20:13.644
You got the gem!

20:13.646 --> 20:16.180
Yes, but the rat
got away

20:16.182 --> 20:17.648
with the Necessi-Key!

20:17.650 --> 20:19.750
[sighs] That's not good.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.821
[sighs] But the important thing
is we have the gem, right?

20:23.823 --> 20:27.391
Right, and at least now
we know who's after
the Wicked Nine.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.927
Chrysta, I think we
should take this

20:29.929 --> 20:31.862
to the other Protectors
for safekeeping.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.732
That's a very good idea,
Trainee.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.601
Thank you, Trainer.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.768
Let's get going.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.203
Bye, Sofia!

20:39.205 --> 20:41.005
Thanks for your help!
We mean it!

20:41.007 --> 20:42.640
Bye, Chrysta!

20:45.411 --> 20:49.013
How could you get my hopes up
and then return without the gem?

20:49.015 --> 20:51.749
Prisma, when life
closes a window,

20:51.751 --> 20:55.553
sometimes it
opens a door.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.389
[gasps] Is that--

20:58.391 --> 21:00.258
a Necessi-Key?

21:00.260 --> 21:04.362
Only the shiniest,
best Necessi-Key
you've ever seen!

21:08.868 --> 21:11.702
At last!
I'm free!

21:11.704 --> 21:16.440
Yes, free to realize
your true potential,

21:16.442 --> 21:21.245
to gather the Wicked Nine
and gain unlimited power.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.782
Yes, and not even
that pesky Princess Sofia

21:24.784 --> 21:26.817
will be able to stop me!

21:31.057 --> 21:33.791
[Twitch chitters]

21:33.793 --> 21:35.893
I don't understand!

21:35.895 --> 21:38.729
Now Prisma escaped
from the Terrible Tower?

21:38.731 --> 21:42.667
We believe she may be
behind the Locket of Vor's
disappearance.

21:42.669 --> 21:45.803
And behind the creature
we saw trying to steal
the Falcon's Eye?

21:45.805 --> 21:49.607
Yes, but thanks to you,
it is now safe with us.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.610
Maybe we should bring
the other Wicked Nine objects
back here, too,

21:52.612 --> 21:54.679
at least the ones
we know where to find.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.681
That is
an excellent idea, Sofia.

My trainee has lots
of great ideas,

21:59.118 --> 22:02.320
and from now on, I'm going
to listen to every one of them.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.122
Protectors, go forth

22:05.124 --> 22:06.691
and retrieve
the Wicked Nine.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.527
Bring back as many of them
as you can find.

22:09.529 --> 22:12.296
Sofia, we have
some work to do.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.764
Let's go!
