No one is getting through that.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.519
Wow, when are you installing
the torture chamber?

00:22.690 --> 00:25.102
You don't like it? I call it medieval chic.

00:25.401 --> 00:26.436
I don't care what it looks like

00:26.527 --> 00:28.438
as long as it keeps Regina
and her skeleton keys out.

00:28.571 --> 00:31.688
This is pretty handy for a writer.
Where did you learn how to do all this?

00:31.782 --> 00:33.067
Woodshop. Eighth grade.

00:33.159 --> 00:35.275
Oh! Speaking of school,
l have to get going.

00:36.746 --> 00:37.861
Are you sure you're ready to go back?

00:37.955 --> 00:40.367

00:40.458 --> 00:42.619
how tough can a room
full of fourth-graders be?

00:43.252 --> 00:45.914
Besides, aren't you the one
we need to be worried about?

00:46.130 --> 00:47.870
Me? Why?

00:48.090 --> 00:51.958
Well, you did threaten
to take Henry away from Regina.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.220
Oh, that wasn't a threat.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.169
I'm hiring Mr. Gold
to help build a case against her.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.926
She tried to frame you for murder.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.518
But you do know what happens
if you win?

01:02.980 --> 01:03.969
Yeah.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.555
And you're ready?

01:06.275 --> 01:07.390
To be his mom?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.229
Yeah.

01:17.745 --> 01:18.860
Hey, Henry. What's going on?

01:18.955 --> 01:22.539
Meet me at Granny’s.
It’s an Operation Cobra emergency.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.115
I'm on my way.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.995
Emma, wait up.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.376
You heard the kid.
Operation Cobra calls.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.003
I didn't think you believed any of that.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.710
I don't. But sometimes, it's the only way
to get through to Henry.

01:35.805 --> 01:39.923
A custody battle against Regina
isn't going to accomplish anything.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.762
You need to look at the big picture.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.014
That's the only way you're gonna
understand what you're up against.

01:45.147 --> 01:48.389
That's the only way
you'll know how to beat Regina.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.190
Okay, new guy, how's that?

01:50.361 --> 01:53.103
Take the day off.
Come with me, and I'll show you.

01:53.656 --> 01:57.615
And where exactly would we be going
on this magical mystery tour?

01:57.702 --> 02:00.694
If I told you, you would never come.

02:02.707 --> 02:04.288
Come on, take a leap of faith.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.126
You come with me and I promise you,

02:06.210 --> 02:07.791
you'll find
exactly what you're looking for.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.370
My kid needs me.
I don't have time for faith.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.016
Hey, what's the emergency?

02:21.100 --> 02:22.089
Shh.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.216
This is sensitive.

02:25.187 --> 02:28.429
If it's sensitive,
why are we at Granny's out in the open?

02:29.150 --> 02:30.139
I'm hungry.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.935
Who else knows that we hide the book
in the Sheriff's station?

02:34.030 --> 02:35.145
No one. Why?

02:35.239 --> 02:36.740
Someone changed it.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.363
There's a new story in it.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.240
Why would someone add a new story?

02:41.203 --> 02:44.070
To tell us something we need to know
about the curse.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.742
And what would that be?

02:45.875 --> 02:47.911
I don't know. The story isn't finished.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.409
Why would someone
go to so much trouble

02:49.545 --> 02:51.752
to add a new story,
and then not bother finishing it?

02:52.048 --> 02:55.836
That's what's weird.
The story's about Pinocchio.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.507
Everyone knows how that ends.

02:57.595 --> 03:02.555
-Well, maybe that's why it was left out.
-Or maybe there's more to it.

And given the Mayor's sway
in this town,

14:38.920 --> 14:43.129
any proceedings against her
would be long, drawn out and futile.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.295
The only certainty is,
Henry would suffer.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.626
I can't do that to your boy.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.220
So we leave him in the same house
with that sociopath?

14:50.307 --> 14:52.298
I'm sorry, Sheriff. My mind's made up.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.423
Well, then change it.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.391
The only person I've ever seen

14:55.479 --> 14:57.310
go head to head with Regina
and win is you.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.975
That's because I know
how to pick my battles.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.101
Then pick this one.

15:00.484 --> 15:01.473
I'm sorry,

15:01.568 --> 15:03.980
I'm afraid I'm just simply not the man
to help you beat Mayor Mills.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.483
No. You're not.

15:11.953 --> 15:12.942
(DOORBELL JINGLES)

15:19.294 --> 15:20.283
-Emma.
-Hey.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.831
Take it easy.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.247
Is everything okay?

15:25.342 --> 15:27.503
No. I am just about out of options.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.000
"Just about"?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.633
You told me to beat Regina,
I need to see the big picture.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.184
Show it to me.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.681
(EXHALES)

15:44.528 --> 15:46.143
Oh! Ow.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.355
Car trouble?

15:52.410 --> 15:54.025
It won't start.

15:54.371 --> 15:58.114
Got a car full of groceries, and well,
it hasn't exactly been a banner day.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.199
Yeah, now, let's see.

16:03.713 --> 16:04.873
(CLICKING)

16:05.090 --> 16:06.125
The battery's dead.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.372
What?

16:07.551 --> 16:08.540
I don't have anyjumper cables,

16:08.635 --> 16:10.375
but I can give you a ride home
in my truck.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.261
No, no.
Thank you, but I couldn't impose.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.379
I insist.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.806
Unless you want to have a car
full of melted rocky road.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.854
Sure.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.524
Thank you for being my knight
in shining armor.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.149
It's more like flannel.
But you're welcome.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.191
Hey, why don't you stay for dinner?

16:35.954 --> 16:38.366
I bought more than enough for me
and Henry. And...

16:39.624 --> 16:41.239
Well, I'm making lasagna.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.538
(H ESITANTLY) I shouldn't.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.705
It's getting late, and I've got to get up
early tomorrow for work.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.458
Of course.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.646
You can just set the bags over there.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.450
What is it?

17:17.329 --> 17:18.569
Henry.

17:19.915 --> 17:23.749
He's having dinner with Archie after
his session instead of coming home.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.335
I'm sorry.

17:27.464 --> 17:31.924
Lately it seems like he'll do anything
to avoid spending time with me.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.512
But I shouldn't be burdening you
with my problems.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.386
You've already helped me
more than enough for one day.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.466
Thank you.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.821
You know what, I do love lasagna.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.326
BLUE FAIRY:
The Evil Queen will stop at nothing

18:04.417 --> 18:07.329
to destroy Snow White
and Prince Charming's happiness.

18:07.462 --> 18:10.625
We must stop at nothing
to undo her curse.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.415
GEPPETTO: It's beautiful.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.218
This is the last enchanted tree
in the entire realm.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.296
It can be done.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.511
I can make a beautiful wardrobe
out of this.

18:22.811 --> 18:26.303
The tree contains enough magic
to protect two from the Queen's curse.

18:28.066 --> 18:31.650
Before the curse strikes,
before Snow gives birth to her child,

18:31.736 --> 18:33.567
she and the Prince
will enter the wardrobe

18:33.697 --> 18:35.483
and travel to a distant land,

18:36.032 --> 18:39.741
a land without magic,
where Snow will give birth to her child.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.406
Then when she reaches her 28th year,

18:42.580 --> 18:45.322
she can begin the battle
that will defeat the Evil Queen.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.663
You see why it is vital
that you complete the task at hand?

18:48.753 --> 18:51.244
Pinocchio wasn't always a real boy.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.923
When the curse strikes,

18:55.385 --> 18:57.376
when the things we love
are ripped away,

18:57.846 --> 19:01.088
he will be turned back into wood again,
won't he?

19:01.224 --> 19:03.180
I'm afraid it's impossible to say.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.224
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)
You're frightening the boy.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.555
No,no.Shh.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.558
I will build your wardrobe.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.147
On one condition.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.239
If Pinocchio can take the second spot
in it.

19:24.956 --> 19:29.370
You can't bargain like this.
Not when the entire realm is in danger.

19:29.461 --> 19:33.921
If I don't, I will lose my boy.
Maybe forever.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.043
I can't risk that.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.500
Snow can raise the child
without her husband.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.211
Geppetto, think about the example
you're setting for Pinocchio.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.295
gréid,

19:43.308 --> 19:44.593
You may be a conscience,

19:44.684 --> 19:48.268
but you have not earned the right
to tell me what to do.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.851
Please, I'm only trying to help.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.941
Help? Help like you helped my parents?

19:56.571 --> 19:59.688
Your debt to me can never be fulfilled.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.529
But a start would be staying out of this.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.111
You understand?

20:06.956 --> 20:07.945
Yes.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.538
Good.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.793
(BECKONING IN ITALIAN)

20:14.547 --> 20:15.536
(GROANS)

20:16.549 --> 20:20.462
Pinocchio goes, too, or no one does.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.298
And what will we tell
the Prince and Snow White?

20:23.556 --> 20:28.175
You will tell them that the tree contains
enough magic to protect only one.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.562
Do we have a deal? Or no?

20:38.822 --> 20:40.403
BLUE FAIRY: The tree is enchanted.

20:40.824 --> 20:43.486
If fashioned into a vessel,
it can ward off any curse.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.654
Geppetto, can you build such a thing?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.365
Me and my boy, we can do it.

20:52.961 --> 20:53.950
This will work.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.210
We all must have faith.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.752
There is, however, a catch.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.966
The enchantment is indeed powerful.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.888
But all power has its limits,

21:08.518 --> 21:11.806
and this tree can protect only one.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.689
A choice must be made.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.651
August, you're gonna tell me
where we're going

21:27.745 --> 21:29.656
and how it's gonna help me
beat Regina?

21:29.747 --> 21:33.239
We're going on a trip, Emma,
so I can tell you somebody's story.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.074
Whose story?

21:35.170 --> 21:36.580
Mine.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.550
How did you like it?

21:52.729 --> 21:54.890
Best lasagna I ever had.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.852
You really know
how to work some magic.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.066
Here, let me get the dishes.

22:01.196 --> 22:02.185
-Oh, no, David.
-No, no.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.149
It's the least I can do.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.322
You saved me
from having to call a tow truck today

22:06.409 --> 22:07.819
and now you're doing my dishes?

22:08.244 --> 22:09.745
Doesn't seem right.

22:10.079 --> 22:14.163
Please. The last couple of weeks
haven't exactly been easy for me,

22:14.250 --> 22:15.581
and you've been there the whole time.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.201
I can't help it. I feel responsible for you.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.417
Ever since I found you.

22:22.217 --> 22:26.961
You know, after all this time,
no one's ever told me the story.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.423
What story?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.506
About how you found me.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.591
It's probably because I'm the only one
who knows it.

22:34.938 --> 22:35.927
(CHUCKLES)

22:37.273 --> 22:38.934
I was working late.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.519
It was a cold night.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.772
It must've been 10 below.

22:43.905 --> 22:48.069
And on my drive home, I realized
I'd left my phone at the office.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.364
I remember thinking

22:50.286 --> 22:53.619
just to forget about it
and I didn't really need it.

22:54.749 --> 22:59.118
But something inside me told me
to turn around and go back.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.381
And that's when you saw me?

23:02.465 --> 23:06.128
You were on the side of the road.
Unconscious.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.636
So cold you felt like ice.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.138
The doctors said
if I'd found you 10 minutes later,

23:12.225 --> 23:13.635
it would have been too late.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.301
It's amazing, isn't it?

23:16.980 --> 23:18.811
lfl hadn't forgotten my phone,

23:18.940 --> 23:22.182
I wouldn't have been on the road
at that time.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.935
Yeah, it's almost...

23:28.491 --> 23:31.733
Almost like the universe
wanted you to find me.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.079
DAVID: Uh...

23:38.167 --> 23:40.658
I'm sorry.
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.742
Oh.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.578
I'm sorry. I just got caught up
in the moment and...

23:43.673 --> 23:45.254
You don't have to apologize.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.002
Ijust... We...

23:48.636 --> 23:50.752
This is great like it is.

24:05.695 --> 24:06.684
Thanks again for dinner.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.384
(SCREAMING) N0!

24:35.975 --> 24:37.806
PRINCE CHARMING:
Doc, do something.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.308
It's gonna be okay.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.727
The wardrobe's almost finished.
Just hold on.

24:42.065 --> 24:43.271
Circumstances have changed.

24:44.734 --> 24:45.894
What do you mean, "changed"?

24:45.985 --> 24:49.193
Snow White is going to give birth early.
The savior will be born at any moment.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.360
Pinocchio can't go.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.993
Snow White must accompany
her daughter or all will be lost.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.664
She must be protected.
This is a land with no magic.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.832
She will need someone to guide her.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.750
Someone to make her believe
in her destiny.

25:04.879 --> 25:05.994
Who better than her mother?

25:06.089 --> 25:07.078
But we had a deal.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.664
There is no time to argue.
The curse is almost upon us,

25:09.759 --> 25:12.717
and I must return to the fairies
to make final preparations.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.720
It is vital that you tell Snow White
what I just told you.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.760
Her child is our only hope.
She's the only one who can save us.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.050
And my boy?

25:20.269 --> 25:21.554
What will happen to him?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.681
All we can do is have faith

25:23.773 --> 25:28.267
that one day the savior will restore
all that we have lost.

25:32.949 --> 25:33.938
(SIGHS)

25:38.079 --> 25:40.070
Shall we tell Snow White?

25:42.583 --> 25:43.789
No.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.083
Get in the wardrobe, my boy.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.961
Geppetto, you can't.

25:53.136 --> 25:55.548
Things have changed.
The savior needs her mother.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.513
No, she needs someone to protect her.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.306
To make her believe in her destiny.

26:01.394 --> 26:04.056
My boy, he can do that.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.308
I don't understand, Father, she said...

26:06.482 --> 26:10.725
I don't care what she said.
All that matters is you are safe.

26:10.903 --> 26:14.737
But you told me to be honest, Father.
You told me not to lie.

26:17.702 --> 26:21.445
Sometimes, we have to lie
to protect the people we love.

26:21.998 --> 26:25.240
You must look out
for the child in this new land.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.620
You must protect her.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.795
I don't want to go.
I don't want to leave you.

26:34.677 --> 26:38.716
Pinocchio, you must remember
what the Blue Fairy said.

26:39.140 --> 26:43.554
In 28 years, you must make sure
the savior believes.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.264
Promise me you'll do that.

26:46.731 --> 26:49.814
That is the only way
we'll see each other again.

Good, good.

26:55.823 --> 26:56.812
Here.

26:58.576 --> 27:02.068
There will be many temptations
in this new world, Pinocchio.

27:02.163 --> 27:06.247
But as long as you remain
brave, truthful and unselfish,

27:06.375 --> 27:07.455
you will not fail.

27:09.712 --> 27:10.918
Here. Here, here.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.301
You'll find me again.

27:28.022 --> 27:31.310
And on that day,
I will look at you with pride.

So what?

this trip was supposed to be about you.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.245
It is.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.494
This is my story.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.493
I promise.

(SHUSHING SOFTLY)

31:35.436 --> 31:37.597
EMMA: Why are we in the woods?

31:37.688 --> 31:39.519
BOOTH: All the answers
you've been searching for

31:39.648 --> 31:40.979
are right where I found you.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.560
See, you're not that 7-year-old boy.

31:42.651 --> 31:45.313
I wasn't found in the woods.
I was found on the side of a highway.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.363
Why do you think that?
Because you read it in the newspaper?

31:49.492 --> 31:50.902
Did it ever occur to you that maybe

31:50.993 --> 31:53.951
that 7-year-old boy lied about
where he found you?

31:54.038 --> 31:55.027
No.

31:55.247 --> 31:59.160
But it occurs to me that you've been
lying to me about everything.

32:00.169 --> 32:02.080
And I'm done listening.

32:03.881 --> 32:06.418
When I found you,
you were wrapped in a blanket.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.417
And the name "Emma"
was embroidered along the bottom of it.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.102
That wasn't in the article, was it?

32:17.561 --> 32:19.938
How would I know that,
unless I was there?

32:20.523 --> 32:21.979
Okay.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.526
Let's say you were that kid.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.025
Why lie about where you found me?

32:27.196 --> 32:28.356
I lied to protect you.

32:28.531 --> 32:29.520
From what?

32:30.825 --> 32:32.156
That.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.275
A tree?

32:35.704 --> 32:37.444
-You've read Henry's book, right?
-(SCOFFS)

32:37.957 --> 32:41.040
You know about the curse, don't you?
Your role in it?

32:42.211 --> 32:43.200
It's true, Emma.

32:43.754 --> 32:46.040
We both came into this world

32:47.758 --> 32:48.747
through this tree.

32:55.057 --> 32:58.891
You're asking me to believe
that you are a fairy tale character?

32:59.436 --> 33:00.721
Pinocchio.

33:02.064 --> 33:05.556
Right, of course, Pinocchio.
Explains all the lying.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.061
You're the one who added the story
to Henry's book.

33:10.156 --> 33:11.487
I needed you to know the truth.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.443
The truth is you're out of your mind.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.112
And you're not even a very good liar.

33:15.244 --> 33:17.405
Why not write the end to that story?

33:17.496 --> 33:20.659
Because this is the ending.
And we're writing it right now.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.250
And how does this story end?

33:23.127 --> 33:24.242
With you believing.

33:28.424 --> 33:29.413
Not gonna happen.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.267

33:53.073 --> 33:54.108
I failed.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.284
What are you talking about?

33:56.493 --> 33:58.449
It doesn't matter. You don't believe.

33:59.663 --> 34:02.450
If you think
that by making me feel sorry for you

34:02.541 --> 34:04.452
that something is gonna change,
you are wrong.

34:04.627 --> 34:07.118
I'm not screwing around here.

34:07.463 --> 34:11.797
Whatever you believe or don't,
this is real, Emma. I am sick.

34:12.301 --> 34:13.507
That's an understatement.

34:13.802 --> 34:14.791
You ever been to Phuket?

34:15.638 --> 34:16.627
It's beautiful.

34:16.722 --> 34:21.307
Amazing island. Full of pleasures,
the perfect place to lose oneself.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.224
That's where I was,

34:23.312 --> 34:26.896
when you decided
to stay in Storybrooke.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.645
How do you know
when I decided to stay in Storybrooke?

34:30.819 --> 34:33.401
Because at 8:15 in the morning,

34:33.489 --> 34:35.775
I woke up
with a shooting pain in my leg.

34:35.908 --> 34:39.526
That's 8:15 at night in Storybrooke.
Sound familiar?

34:39.662 --> 34:42.495
That's when time there
started to move fonNard again.

34:45.209 --> 34:47.791
I was supposed to be there for you,

34:49.004 --> 34:50.255
and I wasn't.

34:50.631 --> 34:52.997
Because I was halfway around
the world,

34:53.133 --> 34:57.172
I got a painful reminder
just how far I had strayed.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.553
If that tree won't make you believe,

35:01.809 --> 35:03.970
maybe this will.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.694
How does that prove anything?

35:21.036 --> 35:24.528
-Look.
-August, I'm looking.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.081
You don't see it, do you?

35:28.210 --> 35:29.711
See what?

35:30.629 --> 35:33.086
Your denial
is more powerful than I thought.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.922
It's preventing you from seeing truth.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.667
Okay, one of us is losing it here.
And it's not me.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.044
You don't want to believe.

35:40.973 --> 35:44.215
After everything you've seen,
why can't you just do it?

35:44.351 --> 35:46.137
Why is it so important to you that I do?

35:46.270 --> 35:49.728
Because I, the town,
everyone needs you.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.980
I don't want them to need me.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.898
Well, that's too bad because we all do.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.731
You're saying that I am responsible
for everyone's happiness?

35:56.822 --> 36:00.030
That is crap. I didn't ask for that.
I don't want it!

36:00.117 --> 36:01.106
Right now.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.907
A little while ago
you didn't want Henry either.

36:03.037 --> 36:05.824
But then he came to you and now
you are fighting like hell for him.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.071
For him!

36:07.207 --> 36:09.823
Because that is all I can handle
right now.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.500
And I'm not even doing a good job
at that.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.499
Now you're telling me
I have to save everyone?

36:14.590 --> 36:17.457
That is beyond ridiculous.
I don't want any of it.

36:18.469 --> 36:20.380
Well, that's too bad, Emma.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.424
Because that doesn't change the truth.

36:24.058 --> 36:26.094
You're our only hope.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.598
Then you're all screwed.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.932

37:22.908 --> 37:24.489

37:26.161 --> 37:27.742
I was just trying to fix the crib.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.821
I didn't want Emma to fall out
and get hurt.

37:31.834 --> 37:34.621
Don't ever touch anything
in this house again.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.835

37:37.631 --> 37:39.132

you okay?

Can you keep a secret?

38:02.823 --> 38:04.438
Wow. Where did you get that?

38:04.533 --> 38:06.524
Stole it from the sock drawer.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.870
It's enough to buy us all bus tickets
out of here.

38:09.329 --> 38:10.705
You're leaving? When?

38:10.789 --> 38:13.496
Right now. You wanna come?

38:18.088 --> 38:22.206
I told my father I'd take care of Emma.
Can she come? Please?

38:22.885 --> 38:24.671
We can't take care of a baby.

he wanted me to be.

Have you tried to make it up to him?

39:51.223 --> 39:55.136
I made him a promise a long time ago.

By the time
I got around to making good on it,

39:59.690 --> 40:00.930
I think it was too late.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.184
But you kept your promise.

40:05.279 --> 40:08.316
You realized your mistake
and you tried to fix it.
