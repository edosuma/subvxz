The basement!

00:54.637 --> 00:55.930
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.724
You've already ruined
the rest of my house,

00:57.807 --> 01:00.060
now you want to ruin
my precious basement, too?

01:00.143 --> 01:03.146
Scratch, if you love the basement so much,
why don't you live down there?

01:03.313 --> 01:05.482
Uh, ew, no. Moldy.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.442
I'm upset by the principle of the thing.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.694
How would you like it
if I messed with your things?

01:17.243 --> 01:20.330
I understand why you think I did that,
but I didn't.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.336
I really hope we can afford these repairs.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.464
Our finances are... tight.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.217
Don't worry, Mom.
I have a no-risk business investment!

01:32.300 --> 01:35.178
Full disclosure,
it requires access to cryptocurrency,

01:35.261 --> 01:38.598
frequent travel to Sweden,
and, uh, a stomach for danger.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.892
Not falling for that. Again.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.603
Since our whole family uses the van,
we should all pitch in.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.605
I will forgo my allowance.

01:45.688 --> 01:46.815
- Darryl will, too.
- What?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.566
You can't forgo for me!

01:48.650 --> 01:50.985
No forgoing! Kids, keep your allowances.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.863
It's probably just
a small teeny-tiny problem

01:53.947 --> 01:56.282
that won't cost much money to fix.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.328
It's a huge problem.
It's gonna cost a lot of money to fix.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.666
I don't suppose
you take an old Sub Shack punch card?

02:04.749 --> 02:06.251
It's got a free BLT!

02:06.918 --> 02:07.794
Eh-eh.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.632
Uh, spit balling here,
are we sure we even need a van?

02:12.715 --> 02:14.300
We could all just stay at home,

02:14.384 --> 02:17.011
going absolutely nowhere
with our lives. Forever!

02:17.303 --> 02:19.597
Doesn't that sound fun, kids? Help.

02:20.849 --> 02:24.102
With all the moving costs,
utility bills, credit card debt,

02:24.185 --> 02:25.812
and now we have another mouth to feed.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.231
I'm a growing ghoul!

02:32.068 --> 02:34.946
It's been a tough year
for the McGee family savings account.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.114
May it rest in peace.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.950
Uh, are we gonna be okay?

02:39.659 --> 02:42.203
Don't worry. McGees always make it work.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.248
And now that we're settled down
in our forever home,

02:45.331 --> 02:47.458
it makes sense to have a second income.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.211
That's right... Mama's gettin' a job!

02:56.926 --> 02:58.261
That was also not me.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.268
Why do we live so far away?

03:05.476 --> 03:07.145
I should be a meter maid.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.981
Then I'd get paid to tell people
they're bad parkers!

03:10.064 --> 03:11.482
You know I'd love that.

03:11.566 --> 03:14.485
Yeah, I mean, personally,
I see you as a brain surgeon.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.905
Although that's not really
a "starting today" thing.

03:16.988 --> 03:20.742
I'm telling you, Mom,
reconsider nuisance lawsuits.

03:20.825 --> 03:24.579
I know a lawyer named Ramón who is
not encumbered with so-called "ethics".

03:26.831 --> 03:29.250
Diner. Help wanted sign. Bang. Solved it.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.544
Like always, Scratch is the hero.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.004
Go cook.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.425
I worked in my parents' restaurant
growing up,

03:37.842 --> 03:40.720
and that was enough kitchen work
for a lifetime.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.723
Never say "go cook" again!

03:45.433 --> 03:46.893
This morning I caught her

03:46.976 --> 03:48.144
glaring at the stove.

03:50.688 --> 03:51.648
Whoa.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.149
You were not kidding.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.611
- Well, it's still cleaning day. Pete,

03:56.694 --> 03:58.947
you and the boys go ahead
and start in on the basement.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.698
- Aww...
- What do you mean "boys"?

04:03.117 --> 04:06.371
<i>♪ It's the McGee's cleaning song ♪</i>

04:06.871 --> 04:09.916
<i>♪ Hope it doesn't take too long ♪</i>

04:09.999 --> 04:11.042
Don't worry.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.044
I'll take care of the van situation.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.463
I have no idea
how to take care of this van situation!

04:15.546 --> 04:17.298
- Okay...
- Where do you even find jobs anymore?

04:17.382 --> 04:18.967
- Well, we could look at...
- Or the newspaper?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.677
- Do they even make newspapers anymore?
- Oh, Mom. Mom!

04:20.760 --> 04:22.136
- Mom! I don't know! Okay?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.888
But they make apps. They make apps.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.559
Huh. Gig Pig.
It's for odd jobs.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.312
Someone needs a job done,
you do it, you get paid, Mama.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.106
Quick cash, just what we need!

04:33.189 --> 04:34.899
- Good thinking!

04:34.983 --> 04:38.486
Ooh! That was fast!
Looks like I've got my first job.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.321
I'm gonna come with!
This is a family problem,

04:40.488 --> 04:42.615
and if you're doing your part,
then I'll do mine, too!

04:42.699 --> 04:45.118
- What's the gig?
- Handing out free food.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.288
- Okay, fine! I'll come!

04:56.838 --> 04:58.256
Where do we start?

04:58.339 --> 05:01.509
Whoa! That's the biggest centipede
I've ever seen.

05:01.592 --> 05:05.388
They say if you see one centipede,
there's a thousand more you can't see.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.056
I think that's cockroaches...

05:07.807 --> 05:09.684
Nope. Centipedes, too!

05:11.185 --> 05:13.229
Clear them out!

05:14.230 --> 05:15.440
Free protein bars!

05:15.523 --> 05:18.651
I scream, you scream,
we all scream for protein!

05:21.738 --> 05:23.906
Mm.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.659
Gah! You know,
I eat food right out of the garbage.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.412
But this... this is garbage.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.539
Protein bar? Protein bar?

05:31.622 --> 05:34.167
Oh, I see you already have one.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.587
Please, tell me,
did we make enough money yet?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.505
- Uh...

05:39.589 --> 05:41.466
Not yet. But we have a new job!

05:41.549 --> 05:42.592
Thank heavens!

05:43.343 --> 05:46.095
I gotta cleanse my palate.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.432
You don't belong here!

05:49.932 --> 05:51.351
Begone, you foul beasts!

05:52.143 --> 05:53.436
- Goochie-goo.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.688
Dad, I think I found something!

05:55.813 --> 05:57.565
- Hopefully not more centipedes.
- Even better!

05:57.648 --> 06:00.318
A tiny mysterious old-timey door!

06:00.443 --> 06:01.319
Can we open it?

06:01.402 --> 06:03.071
Darryl, I'm not exaggerating

06:03.154 --> 06:05.782
when I say
I've been waiting my entire life

06:05.865 --> 06:09.744
for a moment like this.
100 P, we are opening it!

06:12.622 --> 06:13.831
Come on, dogs!

06:13.915 --> 06:16.084
You walk, you poop, you pay us.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.794
I thought we had a deal!

06:18.378 --> 06:19.420
- Huh?

06:21.714 --> 06:23.508
Wait, can dogs see me?

06:23.591 --> 06:25.843
- I don't like it. Make them stop!

06:25.927 --> 06:28.012
- Mom!

06:36.145 --> 06:37.271
Ahh!

06:40.400 --> 06:41.943
- Ahh!

06:42.527 --> 06:44.237
Come on, door!

06:44.320 --> 06:45.363
Please open!

06:45.488 --> 06:47.532
And please have something cool inside!

06:47.615 --> 06:51.244
I bet it's a secret vault
where an old gangster stored all his loot!

06:55.331 --> 06:57.750
<i>Forget fixing the van,
we'll be able to buy a new one!</i>

06:57.834 --> 07:01.045
<i>Maybe one that's electric,
and drives itself, and has a cupholder...</i>

07:01.129 --> 07:02.839
<i>No, two cupholders!</i>

07:02.922 --> 07:06.634
No. There's only one explanation
for where all these centipedes came from.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.429
That door obviously leads
to another world!

07:09.512 --> 07:11.264
A Centipede World.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.978
<i>There's a centipede mayor
and a centipede school.</i>

07:18.521 --> 07:20.440
<i>A centipede shoe store,
a centipede florist.</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:24.360
<i>Maybe a centipede jail filled
with super-buff centipede convicts!</i>

07:24.694 --> 07:26.612
Every day is leg day!

07:27.447 --> 07:30.074
<i>We'll charge admission
and make millions!</i>

07:30.158 --> 07:33.119
Love it. Counterpoint.
I don't think Centipede World is real.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.663
Remember when you didn't think
ghosts were real?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.206
Mm. Um...

07:37.915 --> 07:39.709
Okay, you raise a good point.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.836
Either way, we need to know!

07:41.919 --> 07:43.087
We need to know.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.799
Buffalo can also see me!

07:46.883 --> 07:50.303
Okay, next task... Shovel buffalo patties.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.762
What are buffalo? Ugh.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.145
Do we have enough money
to pay for the van repairs yet?

08:01.564 --> 08:02.773
Not nearly enough.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.610
Mom, it's not enough... yet!

09:23.104 --> 09:28.234
Me, too. This is the moment
when you and I, father and son,

09:28.317 --> 09:31.696
worked together to unravel a mystery
beyond all imagination

09:31.779 --> 09:33.864
and save this family from financial ruin.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.953
Come on, Centipede World!

09:41.205 --> 09:43.583
Every... thing... hurts.

09:43.666 --> 09:47.670
At least you weren't viciously
attacked by wild hounds!

09:47.753 --> 09:49.589
And look at my little cutie bit.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.007
Now it looks like old gum!

09:51.090 --> 09:52.425
- Ahh!

09:52.508 --> 09:53.634
How are we doing, Mom?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.595
We gotta be close to our goal by now.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.099
- We did it! We actually did it!
- We did it?

10:01.392 --> 10:04.604
See? When we come together as a family,
there's nothing we can't accomplish!

10:04.687 --> 10:07.523
Yeah, Mom and the McGees are unstoppable!

10:08.024 --> 10:11.611
- Pete, honey! Great news. We just...

10:12.361 --> 10:15.573
- What?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.325
Yeah, craziest thing.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.994
We were just down here cleaning,
and only cleaning,

10:20.077 --> 10:21.871
and suddenly, boom! So...

10:21.954 --> 10:23.789
we're gonna need a new hot water heater.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.125
Hello? H-honey? Honey?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.585
And she hung up.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.337
Though Mom can never know the truth,

10:29.420 --> 10:32.465
and though it'll cost us
hundreds of dollars to fix...

10:32.548 --> 10:35.384
can you really put a price on the bond
between a father and his son?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.387
No, son. No, you can't.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.807
We fix one problem, another one crops up.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.852
I'm sorry, Mom.
Being a grown up must be hard.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.479
But I'm proud of you!

10:47.063 --> 10:48.981
Sure there was hard work
and silly costumes,

10:49.065 --> 10:50.358
and multiple types of poop,

10:50.441 --> 10:52.151
but you gave it your all
to make us some money!

10:52.234 --> 10:53.486
And that's awesome!

10:53.569 --> 10:54.904
Aww, look at you.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.781
Always finding the silver lining.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.408
You know, I liked getting out there, too.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.285
Trying jobs I'd never heard of.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.664
I should keep being a Gig-Pig!
Our family clearly needs the cash.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.292
- Perfect timing! Let's see the job.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.710
"Help me."

11:12.213 --> 11:14.924
- Ahh! Stop!

11:15.508 --> 11:17.051
- We should help him.
- Yeah.
