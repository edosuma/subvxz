WEBVTT

00:07.008 --> 00:09.625
(theme music playing )

02:05.418 --> 02:07.250
That's what McCall was ridin'.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.002
All right.

02:16.429 --> 02:17.919
Charlie: Evening.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.462
Evening back.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.018
Look at that paint, Charlie.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.800
I seen it.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.140
I had a happy just like that.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.014
Foundered.

02:29.191 --> 02:33.310
- Makes me miserable reminiscing on it.
- Do you know the owner?

02:33.487 --> 02:36.149
If he'd sell the horse
is what he really wants to know.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.316
Well, I don't know if he'd sell.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.905
But the fuckin' jerk's
in that bunkhouse.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.831
- Thank you.
- Evenin'.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.012
( Chattering )

03:21.869 --> 03:23.030
Jack McCall.

03:25.456 --> 03:26.571
I'm done.

03:26.749 --> 03:28.660
I don't wanna play no more.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.369
Bein' a loudmouth cunt,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.537
I guess some time
since he's been here,

03:34.715 --> 03:37.047
this fella who don't
wanna play no more

03:37.218 --> 03:40.085
probably spoke of killin'
Wild Bill Hickok.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.004
Well, we're Bill Hickok's friends.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.267
- I'm Seth Bullock.
- I'm Charlie Utter.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.732
And if you got your head blown off
sittin' here with your back turned,

03:58.906 --> 04:01.238
that'd be as fair a play
as you gave him.

04:19.677 --> 04:23.545
Guess you wanna soften him up some
before you make your offer?

04:26.142 --> 04:28.429
My plan is to take him
to Yankton for trial.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.685
If you got a different idea,
you can ride ahead.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.764
Nah.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.229
Let's take the cocksucker
to Yankton.

04:45.578 --> 04:48.195
I don't know of
a Henry Anderson in camp,

04:48.372 --> 04:50.283
but that don't mean there ain't.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.699
This was took of him
in the Union army.

04:52.877 --> 04:56.120
He'd be 12 years older now.
Could you let her hold it?

04:56.297 --> 04:58.959
With so much showing,
it's pretty near fallin' apart.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.630
Here.
Third from the middle.

05:05.139 --> 05:08.552
That, uh... right there?

05:08.726 --> 05:12.014
- Yeah.
- That face don't-- don't look familiar.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.895
Thanks for lookin'.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.896
You definite he's in these hills?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.648
Wrote from Bismarck,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.809
said he'd send for us
when he got set up.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.273
Man:
I just gotta say

05:21.447 --> 05:24.815
it's no guarantee your dad's
anywhere near this area.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.825
And there's no fuckin' joy
in me telling you that,

05:27.995 --> 05:31.329
but it's the goddamned truth
and the way human beings are.

05:31.499 --> 05:35.493
- He said he'd send for Mother and us.
- Is your mama here?

05:35.669 --> 05:38.001
She passed.

05:39.632 --> 05:42.340
Sorry. Well, good luck.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.877
Do you know of-- of work for me?

05:45.054 --> 05:48.012
- No.
- She can get work right here.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.139
- Boy: No, sir.
- Girl: No, thank you.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.354
- Can you push a broom?
- And I could start now.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.937
Four bits a day. And I'd bet
you'd like the first in advance.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.942
If you wouldn't mind.

06:04.657 --> 06:06.022
Same for her,

06:06.200 --> 06:08.612
as regrets for me being
such a ruffian.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.948
Here you go, honey.

06:12.623 --> 06:15.160
If I don't fire him first,
you can pick him up at 10:00.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.291
Thank you, sir.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.122
I'll wait for you, Miles.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.378
Find a safe place to wait, you hear?

06:26.095 --> 06:30.214
We teach a special
sweepin' technique here.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.722
Follow her lead.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.574
(man coughing)

06:56.625 --> 06:58.707
It's all right, son.
It's all right.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.831
Um... excuse me.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.876
I'm required to be
at the graveyard.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.887
The widow Garret is
laying her husband to rest.

07:12.057 --> 07:15.516
I'd have bet a month's wages that burial
would've took place in New York City,

07:15.686 --> 07:17.597
if I had a fuckin' payin' job.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.559
The, uh... wet cloth to his lips

07:20.733 --> 07:23.395
seems to give him some relief.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.607
- All right.
- Thank you.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.241
What do you think of my patient, Doc?

07:40.419 --> 07:43.081
You might wanna steer clear
of his reflection for a while,

07:43.255 --> 07:45.667
but you're symptom-free.
You ain't contagious no more

07:45.841 --> 07:47.502
and you can't get re-infected, so--

07:47.676 --> 07:49.792
Them as heals under my care
stay fuckin' healed.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.132
- Thanks, Doc.
- I got clothes for you back here.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.142
Hereafter in calamity,
I'll be sure to call for Jane.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.303
( Chuckles )
You gonna stick around the camp?

08:00.481 --> 08:02.472
- I believe I will for a while.
- Good,

08:02.650 --> 08:04.812
'cause I wanna
monitor your activities,

08:04.985 --> 08:07.898
find out what you do that weighs
so heavy on your conscience.

08:08.072 --> 08:11.815
When I first come on you in the woods,
all you could say was, "I apologize."

08:11.992 --> 08:14.654
Before you exhibit yourjohnson,
I'm gonna see to this fella.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.205
So long. Good luck to you.

08:16.372 --> 08:17.988
- Good luck to you.
- All right.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.123
- You're on your own for alterations.
- Hmm.

08:26.674 --> 08:30.463
Now I'm gonna lay this cloth
on your fuckin' lips.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.467
Trixie:
There's Mr. Star to collect us.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.845
Mr. Star has been
ever so attentive.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.482
- Very considerate.
- To you.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.446
When we leave the hotel,
my boss will be watchin'.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.830
Shall I reel and stagger?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.453
.---

09:06.630 --> 09:08.667
I know the risk
lying to him has put you to.

09:08.841 --> 09:12.835
I've-- I can't imagine why
I'd make it the subject of humor.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.719
- You're feeling better.
- ( knock on door)

09:22.104 --> 09:24.061
- Am I early?
- Good morning, Mr. Star.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.596
I'll be ready in just a moment.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.061
- I can have a cup of coffee downstairs.
- No, not at all.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.476
Wait.
Wait in here with Trixie.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.195
I'll just be a moment.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.083
That widow ain't high.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.093
Maybe waiting
till after the service.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.097
When she'd wanna get good and fucking loaded
is before the fucking service,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.759
against all the fucking carrying on.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.440
- What do you think?
- Makes sense.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.944
Meaning all that whore's been
telling me the last 10 fucking days

10:13.113 --> 10:16.606
about seeing the widow taking the dope,
and your own fucking assurances--

10:16.784 --> 10:20.322
you verify that she's loaded personally--
you're both full of shit.

10:20.496 --> 10:22.407
I checked in on the woman daily.

10:22.581 --> 10:26.119
If I was fooled, perhaps I've
chosen simplemindedness, Al,

10:26.293 --> 10:28.204
over realizing a certain friend

10:28.378 --> 10:31.871
has used me as an instrument
of purposes he concealed.

10:32.049 --> 10:36.088
Say what you're gonna say
or prepare for eternal fucking silence.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.719
I don't believe you commissioned me
to make an offer

10:38.889 --> 10:41.506
on the widow's claim
to keep the regulators off you, Al.

10:41.683 --> 10:45.551
I think someone found something
out there you want.

10:45.729 --> 10:49.472
Assume you ain't been privy
to the ins and outs of that matter

10:49.650 --> 10:51.812
for the sake
of fucking conversation, huh?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.363
I mean, was I asleep, EB,

10:54.530 --> 10:57.147
when you and me
declared undying loyalty

10:57.324 --> 10:59.565
and full-faith mutual disclosure

10:59.743 --> 11:02.405
about every fucking detail
of every fucking move we were

11:02.579 --> 11:05.788
- ever gonna fucking make together?
- You used me as a pawn, Al.

11:05.958 --> 11:10.168
And you fucked up the game
is the central fucking present issue.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.831
We agreed on 2,000.
You want a fucking percentage instead?

11:15.008 --> 11:18.967
Is that such an inconceivable
proposition?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.425
- Yeah, you got a percentage, EB.
- How big?

11:22.599 --> 11:25.682
Two percent of the first million,
half a percent after.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.183
You wanna feel a damp palm, Al,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.348
select either of these hands.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.018
Just get to the funeral, EB.
Go to 20 if you have to.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.857
Just get that fucking claim.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.443
20 if I have to. My word.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.411
What a handsome man.
Wish I could tell you I recognize him.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.038
Thank you anyway.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.199
- Your dad, I expect.
- Yes.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.742
You have reason
to think he's out here?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.537
He wrote us from Bismarck
he'd be prospecting the hills.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.548
- "Us" being?
- My brother.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.425
He just got work over here.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.381
Good for him.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.671
So it's just the two of you?

12:03.849 --> 12:06.841
Our mother passed.
Why we come from Buffalo.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.351
- And you're out here looking for your dad.
- Yes.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.899
- Uh, Henry?
- Yes.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.056
Out here looking
for her father, Eddie--

12:14.234 --> 12:15.975
her and her older brother.

12:16.153 --> 12:19.020
Got a photograph, I don't...
I don't recognize the likeness.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.403
No.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.565
- Henry Anderson?
- Yes.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.451
- Yeah, I don't recognize him.
- Mm.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.073
What are you gonna do
while your brother works?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.538
Work too, while we're looking
to set aside, if we have to move on.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.294
Oh, if Dad doesn't turn up here.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.377
Yeah, what do you do?

12:38.550 --> 12:42.214
Cook, clean, sew, sweep.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.845
Uh-huh.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.804
- How quick do you learn?
- Guess I learn pretty quick.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.594
Maestro.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.643
We are strangers and sojourners.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.902
Mr. Garret's burial place

13:01.073 --> 13:03.314
is a great distance from New York City.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.449
But his home

13:05.619 --> 13:07.951
- is in His Father's house.
- Ingrid... Marta...

13:08.121 --> 13:10.613
- And on the great day...
- ...Mama...

13:10.791 --> 13:13.123
- His Father will take him into it.
- ...Papa.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.161
As He will all who
confess His Son savior

13:17.339 --> 13:20.297
from wherever
we may be put to rest.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.460

13:49.121 --> 13:50.953

I hope you ain't gived up

14:57.731 --> 14:59.392
Oh, do you worry for her, Dan,

14:59.566 --> 15:01.523
wandering the muck
of our thoroughfare,

15:01.693 --> 15:04.526
her tiny self all but
swallowed up in horseshit?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.948
Hey, kid! Come here.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.244
- Yes, sir?
- Stand with us here a second.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.789
What are-- what are we doing?

15:19.169 --> 15:20.659
Waiting.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.833
Al:
And out the door he'll go,

15:28.011 --> 15:29.922
and prompt as
a Swiss fucking timepiece

15:30.097 --> 15:33.260
three big-tittied whores will now
emerge from behind that screen.

15:38.647 --> 15:42.390
He lines 'em up at two-foot intervals,
smock tops down,

15:42.567 --> 15:46.356
and all but sprints past 'em,
giving their titties a lick.

15:46.530 --> 15:49.989
And if he misses a titty,
does not let himself retrace his steps.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.820
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah, and then he goes on his way home,

15:52.994 --> 15:55.611
relieved for the day.
What's your name? It's Miles, huh?

15:55.789 --> 15:57.075
- Miles, yeah.
- Yeah.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.284
Strange, huh, Miles?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.291
But something you gotta
know about specialists:

16:01.461 --> 16:03.452
they pay a premium

16:03.630 --> 16:06.167
and they never
cause fucking trouble.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.459
I sometimes imagine in my declining
years running a small joint

16:09.636 --> 16:12.344
in Manchester, England,
catering to specialists exclusive.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.802
And to let 'em know they're amongst
their own, I'll operate from the corner,

16:15.976 --> 16:18.468
hanging upside down
like a fucking bat, hmm?

16:21.148 --> 16:24.231
- We're not bad sorts here, huh, Miles?
- No, sir.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.359
So do you wanna ask your sister
if she'd like to reconsider, hmm?

16:27.529 --> 16:29.770
You don't really
mean that, Mr. Swearengen.

16:29.948 --> 16:34.192
Of course I don't mean it. How dare you
suggest I'd mean a thing like that, huh?

16:36.079 --> 16:40.289
I did my part-- raised our offer to 20
and demanded answer within the day.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.290
But what, you cocksucker?

16:42.460 --> 16:45.498
Complications have ensued:
Bullock's come back.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.664
I expect she'll wanna
take counsel with him.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.176
Tell the whore I wanna see her.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.007
And I trust this doesn't
alter our agreement.

16:55.182 --> 16:58.300
I trust you know 2% of nothing's
fucking nothing.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.638
That fella from Montana I knew to trust
won't be able to assay your claim.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.271
I see.

17:05.442 --> 17:08.230
We'll engage someone local,
and I'll keep an eye on him.

17:08.403 --> 17:12.988
As I've decided to stay in camp,
Mr. Bullock, at least for the near term,

17:13.157 --> 17:16.070
I hope you'll feel absolved
of those responsibilities

17:16.243 --> 17:20.532
towards my interest that you
undertook at Mr. Hickok's request.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.074
I prefer to see 'em through.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.367
They're properly mine.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.207
I even feel marginally
capable of shouldering them

17:28.381 --> 17:31.499
and I certainly realize
that you and Mr. Star

17:31.676 --> 17:34.054
have responsibilities of your own.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.381
Are you firing me, Mrs. Garret?

17:39.559 --> 17:43.097
I'm offering you absolution.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.387
Otherwise I'm staying on.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.329
I'm so sorry you were hurt.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.165
So how hard are they
coming at you to sell?

18:08.338 --> 18:10.579
I could confide

18:10.757 --> 18:13.465
that in an effort
to blur my judgment,

18:13.635 --> 18:15.626
Mr. Swearengen
engaged intermediaries

18:15.804 --> 18:17.420
to indulge me with opium.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.760
But that would entail
acknowledging that

18:20.934 --> 18:23.221
I've had a weakness in that direction.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.515
Uh...

18:26.690 --> 18:30.058
more appropriately,
uh, I could add

18:30.235 --> 18:33.102
at the graveyard
Mr. Farnum raised his offer

18:33.280 --> 18:36.113
$7,500,

18:36.283 --> 18:39.651
presumably also on
Mr. Swearengen's instruction,

18:39.828 --> 18:42.946
and set a 24-hour limit to my reply.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.582
Under the circumstances,
I'd say that's coming pretty hard.

18:48.169 --> 18:51.161
Please forgive me for making
you uncomfortable, Mr. Bullock.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.956
I had better manners
before I began to abstain.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.624
That's all right.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.807
Anyways, are you at risk
for the smallpox?

19:03.977 --> 19:07.015
I was inoculated
in New York City.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.773
The child whose life you saved
presumably has not been,

19:11.943 --> 19:14.685
but I assume she's safer
under my care

19:14.863 --> 19:17.605
than traveling in a covered wagon
with strangers.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.864
Anyways, I'll line up the assayer.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.696
Thank you.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.250
You are changed.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.001
You seem to be too.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.796
Our stock's depleted,
but we are offering a 100% discount

19:38.970 --> 19:40.927
on any item that catches your eye.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.804
I've got money.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.011
Our special get-
acquainted-with-those-

19:45.185 --> 19:47.347
we'd-like-to-get-
acquainted-with sale.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.483
Mr. Utter.

19:53.568 --> 19:57.732
I brought these
pickaxes for you to sell.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.989
There's two sifters on that
black cayuse out there.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.321
Mighty grateful, sir.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.987
You got this place just
about built, don't you?

20:06.164 --> 20:08.371
Saving the last
master-strokes for Seth.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.331
Oh, hello. I didn't see you.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.872
Hello.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.791
Hey, that's that little girl, isn't it?

20:18.968 --> 20:20.879
Taking care of her for Mrs. Garret.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.386
As much as she favors you,
she could be yours.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.894
I lost the receipts for my costs.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.022
Maybe while you was busy
saving my partner's life.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.942
Let me get these sifters for you.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.280
See if you can make
those accounts add up.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.457
I don't know if you heard me inside

20:56.631 --> 20:59.293
thanking you for helping my friend.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.255
I heard you. It's all right.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.595
I'm sorry you lost yours.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.258
All right. Thank you.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.568
Welcome back, Mr. Utter.

21:16.734 --> 21:20.102
We've had a mild increase in rates,
but I do have a room available.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.066
I'll see.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.657
What do you want, Mr. Farnum?

21:29.831 --> 21:33.620
I have a message for Trixie
that's looking to that orphan child.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.002
- She's to see her longer-term employer.
- I'll tell her.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.008
You know who that is?

21:41.801 --> 21:43.383
I know she works at The Gem.

21:43.553 --> 21:46.796
And even so, admit her
to your trade at public hours--

21:46.973 --> 21:49.840
congratulations, sir,
on your advanced thinking.

21:52.437 --> 21:53.927
Al wants you, Trixie.

21:55.732 --> 21:59.646
Stickler for self-delivered
messages.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.063
Our dad ain't here.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.983
I know it,
even if my brother don't.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.695
Maybe he never even
tried to get here.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.955
Or maybe he did try
to get here and couldn't,

22:14.125 --> 22:15.866
maybe something happened to him.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.001
There's so many ways
it could be, Flora,

22:18.171 --> 22:20.162
it's not much point
deciding which it was.

22:20.340 --> 22:24.208
He'd never think that though--
my brother.

22:26.179 --> 22:29.046
Must be how he needs to do.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.511
I ain't a virgin--

22:31.684 --> 22:33.266
if you wanna know that.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.268
I had a boyfriend in Buffalo.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.181
And was you upset
to have to leave him?

22:39.359 --> 22:42.226
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.531
I was upset.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.991
At the same time
he was a stupid son of a bitch.

22:51.162 --> 22:52.493
And rough.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.700
Here.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.502
You can't tell
my brother about him.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.718
He'd make it back to Buffalo
and shoot Lewis in the head.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.883
All that way in defense
of your virtue?

23:16.312 --> 23:18.849
That's more trouble
than I ever took with it.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.366
<i>CY'</i>

23:37.250 --> 23:39.161
Lazarus risen.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.377
Look at you, you son of a gun.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.164
Hello, Cy.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.757
Good to see you, Andy.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.634
Don't be afraid
to shake with me, Eddie.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.920
I ain't contagious no more.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.805
Highly becoming outfit.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.638
I'm here for my belongings.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.607
Look...

24:00.773 --> 24:02.275
they're gone, Andy.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.774
Measures to stop the spread.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.274
Ah hell, the important
thing is you're well.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.782
I'll front you whatever you need.
Let's get something going, hmm?

24:11.951 --> 24:15.444
- Andy?
- In the flesh, sweetheart.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.740
- Which ain't much to look at.
- You made it, Andy.

24:19.917 --> 24:23.126
Oh, and we ain't
getting nothing going.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.628
All I come back for, Cy,
was my things,

24:25.798 --> 24:28.130
and you tossed them too.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.384
Why don't you take this and get
yourself outta that clown outfit?

24:31.554 --> 24:33.295
Once you've cooled off a little,

24:33.473 --> 24:36.181
think how you'd have done different
when somebody showed up

24:36.351 --> 24:38.934
in the shape you was in
and my responsibilities to meet.

24:39.103 --> 24:42.846
Better than to throw him
in the woods to fucking die?

24:45.818 --> 24:47.980
Then don't think
about nothing, Andy.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.444
Use the money for a whore

24:50.615 --> 24:52.697
and a toot and go join
the fucking circus.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.867
Did you turn her out?

24:57.038 --> 24:59.120
Her brother's gonna be a problem.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.702
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother

25:01.876 --> 25:03.833
if we have to kill the cocksucker.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.501
That's an interesting
piece of strange.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.095
( Knocks )

25:21.437 --> 25:23.269
Ain't you a picture?

25:25.233 --> 25:27.144
- What is it?
- Hmm?

25:28.194 --> 25:32.734
Oh, am I detaining you
in some way?

25:32.907 --> 25:35.899
Am I fucking imposing?

25:38.329 --> 25:40.741
Mrs. Garret's
to sit down with Bullock.

25:40.915 --> 25:43.532
I thought you'd want me over there.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.293
Oh yeah, so you can bring me
a full and fair report, huh?

25:46.462 --> 25:49.124
But will the widow have her
wits about her, Trixie, huh?

25:49.298 --> 25:51.505
Or will they be passing the opium pipe

25:51.676 --> 25:55.135
like heathens between 'em,
her and fucking Bullock, hmm?

25:55.304 --> 25:57.921
- What're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.760
I'm in fucking wonderment.

25:59.934 --> 26:03.552
I'm waiting to be kept happy
by the next fucking fairy tale.

26:03.730 --> 26:07.064
Do you want me back at the hotel
or do you wanna do something to me?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.777
Now why would I want you
to go back there, huh?

26:12.947 --> 26:15.314
Or rely on anything you said transpired

26:15.491 --> 26:19.735
after you lied about
her taking that dope, huh?

26:21.289 --> 26:23.121
Her being high...

26:23.291 --> 26:24.952
wasn't gonna have nothing to do

26:25.126 --> 26:27.458
with whether or not
she sold you that claim,

26:27.628 --> 26:29.585
and she wanted
to get off the dope.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.088
And that little one needs
someone to care for her...

26:37.430 --> 26:39.671
and maybe get her
the fuck outta here.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.478
And I knew it wasn't gonna be me.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.728
So you want me back over there

26:46.898 --> 26:49.560
and to tell you what
they fucking decide?

26:52.445 --> 26:54.937
Or do you wanna
rip my fucking guts out?

27:01.913 --> 27:03.779
Get back there quick.

27:11.589 --> 27:14.752
Don't kid yourself, Trixie.
Don't get a mistaken idea.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.497
Mr. Utter.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.616
This is where Bill got killed, huh?

27:53.548 --> 27:55.255
Uh...

27:55.424 --> 27:58.212
I'll be sorry about that
for as long as I live.

28:00.054 --> 28:02.341
Can you tell me about it?

28:02.515 --> 28:05.132
Yeah.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.680
It-- it was about sun-up

28:08.855 --> 28:11.187
over at that Bella Union joint,

28:11.357 --> 28:14.475
Mr. Hickok plum
gutted McCall at draw.

28:16.237 --> 28:19.229
And now here Mr. Hickok
was at poker again.

28:19.407 --> 28:22.866
Say a couple hours of daylight left

28:23.035 --> 28:26.073
and in come that coward McCall.

28:28.165 --> 28:31.453
Walked up on him
and shot him in the head.

28:35.506 --> 28:38.373
Bill never know when he come in.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.545
Uh, those of us that did,

28:43.723 --> 28:46.590
we didn't have no inkling
of what he intended.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.310
He just murdered him,
right where he sat.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.891
Man:
If I may, sir...

28:55.109 --> 28:56.520
this is here where

28:56.694 --> 28:59.607
Wild Bill was sitting when McCall
entered from the front,

28:59.780 --> 29:01.908
approached the table,
causing no apprehension

29:02.074 --> 29:04.566
'cause he had often
frequented the game.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.532
Of a sudden,
McCall produced a revolver

29:07.705 --> 29:11.573
and shouting "Take that,
damn you!" he fired.

29:11.751 --> 29:15.085
Muzzle couldn't have been
three inches from Wild Bill's head.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.962
Now I'm told that Hickok
fell dead immediately,

29:18.132 --> 29:19.714
but I won't testify to it,

29:19.884 --> 29:24.219
because the bullet, after it passed
through Wild Bill's brain,

29:24.388 --> 29:25.844
struck me in my right wrist,

29:26.015 --> 29:29.679
and I lost several seconds to pain
before regaining my senses.

29:31.062 --> 29:35.021
Sir, you have my word
as eyewitness to the rest,

29:35.191 --> 29:39.401
and I suppose this wound
as added proof, for the doctors

29:39.570 --> 29:43.063
they feared crippled me
in the hand I use to write.

29:44.283 --> 29:48.447
I will take the murderer's
bullet to my grave.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.744
Thanks.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.675
Aces over eights,

30:04.845 --> 30:07.132
as I just now recall.

30:07.306 --> 30:10.719
That is the hand
that Wild Bill had.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.683
Sure, captain. Sure.

30:18.943 --> 30:21.025
You like how that falls?

30:23.030 --> 30:24.862
Sure.

30:25.032 --> 30:28.195
- Do you like it, Flora?
- Why not?

30:30.830 --> 30:33.413
I'd prefer you happy, honey,
but if you can't be,

30:33.582 --> 30:35.994
you need to pretend at it
better than you're doing

30:36.168 --> 30:40.082
or you're gonna be hungry and cold
and getting done to you for nothing outside

30:40.256 --> 30:43.169
what you'd have made money
to live on and save up besides

30:43.342 --> 30:45.629
if you acted the part in here.

30:45.803 --> 30:48.966
I thought I only had to act it
with them that wanna stick it in me.

30:49.140 --> 30:52.428
You never know
who that might be, Flora.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.603
There you go.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.226
I prefer you happy.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.653
Or at least pretending better?

31:15.875 --> 31:17.866
I think he's dead, Doc.

31:23.466 --> 31:27.505
Could you tell the litter bearers not to make
so much of getting this one outta here?

31:37.730 --> 31:41.223
- Has young Joey gone to dust?
- Yeah.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.771
As flesh must,

31:44.945 --> 31:47.403
to be restored
by the savior's return.

31:50.242 --> 31:53.405
Oh, Mr. Bullock is back among us,

31:53.579 --> 31:55.911
and also, also Mr. Utter.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.824
Does Charlie know about Bill?

31:59.001 --> 32:02.164
They were together, Mr. Bullock and he.
They'd captured Jack McCall.

32:02.338 --> 32:05.581
I hope that's only the beginning
of what they fucking did to him.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.125
- Gave him over to the federal authorities.
- Gave him over?

32:08.302 --> 32:12.421
- Rendered unto Caesar.
- Jesus Christ.

32:12.598 --> 32:17.593
Mr.-- Mr. Bullock was
struck by an lndian's axe.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.603
Marked like the firstborn
of Adam and Eve.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.764
- Are you drunk?
- No.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.272
(groaning)

32:27.613 --> 32:29.945
- What the fuck is that?
- He's all right.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.232
All right, Reverend.
All right, Reverend.

32:32.409 --> 32:33.786
All right.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.868
You're all right, Reverend.
All right.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.046
He marks us sinful

32:47.216 --> 32:49.253
and forgiven by confession.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.757
All right.

32:50.928 --> 32:54.341
He has told us and shown us.
He has told me.

32:54.515 --> 32:57.098
All right.

32:57.268 --> 32:59.430
You listen to me now, Reverend.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.311
You are goddamn exhausted

33:02.481 --> 33:04.267
and you give yourself no respite.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.978
These seizures may owe
something to that,

33:07.153 --> 33:09.144
but it also wouldn't surprise me

33:09.321 --> 33:12.404
if you had a lesion
in your goddamn head

33:12.575 --> 33:14.657
and that's what's
giving you the seizures

33:14.827 --> 33:18.661
and generating your chats
with the goddamn Divinity.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.747
No goddamn offense intended.

33:23.794 --> 33:26.206
- None taken, sir.
- Now get outta here

33:26.380 --> 33:29.418
- and get yourself some rest!
- Jane: Go on, Reverend.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.134
Doc's tired too,

33:33.304 --> 33:36.592
the only reason he's
talking so fucking harsh.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.937
Could not the lesion be

33:45.107 --> 33:48.441
the instrument of God's
instructive intention, Doctor,

33:48.611 --> 33:50.773
if I am so afflicted?

33:50.946 --> 33:52.687
Well, of course it could,

33:52.865 --> 33:56.449
His ways not being ours
and so forth.

33:56.619 --> 34:00.157
But could He not,
Reverend, just want you

34:00.331 --> 34:04.165
getting out of here and getting
yourself some goddamn rest?

34:24.688 --> 34:27.225
- Flora: You have to go now.
- We don't have to do nothing.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.606
I'd pay the same price
just to sit with you.

34:29.777 --> 34:32.815
My brother works in this place up here,
Terrance, and he keeps a hard watch.

34:32.987 --> 34:36.697
If you wanna stick it in me again tomorrow,
you better let me go in by myself.

34:36.867 --> 34:39.484
- What time are you gonna start?
- 11:00, I guess.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.277
I'll be receiving around noon.

34:42.623 --> 34:46.536
All right, Flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.

34:46.710 --> 34:47.824
You're swell.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.764
Evening. Evening, miss.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.979
- You're early.
- Yes.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.274
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- No, no luck.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.774
I knew you would've had a cheerier
look on your face if you had.

35:11.944 --> 35:15.858
Let me get you a place to sit away
from these rough sumbitches.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.284
Hey!

35:22.454 --> 35:25.492
Do your drinking at the bar
or get the fuck out of here!

35:30.796 --> 35:32.298
You have a seat here.

35:34.717 --> 35:37.960
I'll get you a beverage. Do you
want a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?

35:38.137 --> 35:40.344
- Cider if it's not a trouble.
- Soft cider.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.558
Did she find her dad?

35:48.105 --> 35:50.642
Her chances of finding
her dad are greater than yours

35:50.816 --> 35:52.648
of walking out of this door upright,

35:52.818 --> 35:54.980
unless you shut your fucking mouth.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.145
You got it?

36:00.326 --> 36:02.442
Swearengen's had his hand
on the tiller

36:02.619 --> 36:05.111
far as getting dealing
with this epidemic.

36:05.289 --> 36:08.907
- Is that so?
- The dead don't drink or chase women

36:09.084 --> 36:11.291
must be his thinking on that subject.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.127
That Indian fought like hell.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.838
I'd guess you did too.

36:21.305 --> 36:23.512
Charlie figured out
how it must have been.

36:23.682 --> 36:28.051
The Indian had to kill me
for coming on the burial place,

36:28.228 --> 36:30.720
and maybe it had been me too
that killed his friend,

36:30.898 --> 36:34.516
cut his friend's head off so his friend
wouldn't have eyes to see the sunset

36:34.693 --> 36:36.934
all those years he'd be
lying there dead.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.978
So he had to kill me for that too.

36:40.491 --> 36:44.860
And he couldn't before he'd laid hands on me
or the killing wouldn't be honorable.

36:45.037 --> 36:48.530
We fought like fucking hell,
I'll tell you that much.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.119
And I never once had the upper-hand.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.910
It just happened out
the way it happened out.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.879
He was just trying to live,
same as me,

36:58.050 --> 37:01.384
and do honor to his friend and make
some fucking sense out of things.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.045
And we wind up that way.
And I wind up after

37:04.223 --> 37:07.090
beating him till I couldn't
recognize his face.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.184
For Christ's sake!

37:15.109 --> 37:18.602
That Indian saved Jack McCall's life,

37:18.779 --> 37:22.067
- I'll tell you that fucking much.
- Not for long.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.568
Brian MacDonald's not coming,
I want his recommendation

37:27.746 --> 37:29.657
who should assay
that widow's claim.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.574
- Whose?
- Swearengen's.

37:38.090 --> 37:41.082
Shit, Seth.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.878
Get his opinion too, who should guard
that henhouse we're gonna build.

37:52.062 --> 37:55.145
So... are you okay?

37:55.315 --> 37:58.478
- Yes. And you?
- Yes.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.863
They're nice here.

38:01.029 --> 38:04.442
And Mr. Swearengen,
he's funny as all get-out.

38:07.578 --> 38:09.740
So what place would make
a better score?

38:12.207 --> 38:13.868
Where I'm working.

38:14.877 --> 38:16.993
But why not take 'em both?

38:23.760 --> 38:26.673
- Could we have a private talk?
- Sure we can.

38:27.931 --> 38:30.093
- Should I be armed?
- Where do you wanna talk?

38:30.267 --> 38:32.349
Come here.

38:38.275 --> 38:39.765
What do you think of that?

38:39.943 --> 38:43.356
I think that son of a bitch better stop
looking evil at that little girl.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.778
Al: So was it McCall

38:52.956 --> 38:55.334
- improved your appearance?
- No.

38:55.501 --> 38:59.665
Whoever got the job done,
I hope you gave as good as you got.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.830
It's good to have you back,
with me being superstitious

39:03.008 --> 39:04.999
and all hell breaking loose
when you left.

39:05.177 --> 39:07.339
I'm here to talk about Mrs. Garret.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.179
That planted her husband this morning?

39:10.349 --> 39:12.260
I wrote a man about
coming to assay her claim,

39:12.434 --> 39:14.846
- but he can't make it.
- Plenty of local alternatives.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.352
I want you to nominate someone.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.184
Do you?

39:19.358 --> 39:23.602
So if any way his work was mistaken,
I'd be coming after you.

39:24.780 --> 39:27.067
- You would?
- Yeah.

39:27.241 --> 39:30.154
Since I got nothing to do
with the fucking venture,

39:30.327 --> 39:32.910
what if I decline to make
the fucking recommendation?

39:33.080 --> 39:35.868
Then you better hope
whoever I find does his job right,

39:36.041 --> 39:38.703
'cause I'm still
holding you accountable.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.493
I ain't involved.

39:41.797 --> 39:44.164
EB Farnum offered on her claim.

39:44.341 --> 39:47.584
Farnum's your water-boy and I know
what you've been trying to do to her.

39:48.679 --> 39:51.171
So here you come in all nobility...

39:52.224 --> 39:53.885
threatening me with a dire result

39:54.059 --> 39:56.221
if the property that widow's husband

39:56.395 --> 39:58.261
thought worthless and wanted sold

39:58.438 --> 40:01.100
turns out not to be pinched out.

40:01.275 --> 40:03.983
You and I know how it is,
Mr. Swearengen.

40:04.152 --> 40:07.816
- How what is?
- She gets a square shake,

40:07.990 --> 40:10.357
or I come for you.

40:10.534 --> 40:13.117
What if I come for you?
Are you ready for that?

40:13.287 --> 40:14.743
I guess I'd better be.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.450
Then close your fucking store,
'cause being ready for me

40:17.624 --> 40:19.410
will take care of your waking hours

40:19.585 --> 40:23.169
and you better have someone to hand
the task off to when you close your eyes.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.251
We understand each other.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.507
Johnny: Al! Al!

40:35.517 --> 40:37.019
Jesus fucking Christ!

40:37.185 --> 40:39.222
Walk right past me, Your Holiness,

40:39.396 --> 40:41.228
so I can shut my fucking office.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.223
Al!

40:44.401 --> 40:46.438
Dan:
Go on! Stare at her now!

40:46.612 --> 40:48.774
Huh? You like fucking little girls?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.483
Take a look at that little girl

40:50.657 --> 40:53.035
'cause she's the last thing
you're ever gonna see.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.284
- Stare at her now, cocksucker.
- Al: Let him down!

40:56.455 --> 40:58.241
Let him fucking down!

40:58.415 --> 41:01.157
(gagging)

41:16.475 --> 41:18.307
Or should I have had him
hold him up?

41:21.480 --> 41:23.517
You head what I said
about the widow.

41:23.690 --> 41:26.022
Oh yes, Your Holiness.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.605
You heard me too.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.456
So I take it this was
a fair fucking fight, yeah?

41:43.627 --> 41:44.992
Men:
Yeah! That's right!

41:45.170 --> 41:47.502
- Two free drinks for everybody.
- ( men cheering )

41:47.673 --> 41:50.335
And drinks all night for them
that helps with the disposal.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.045
Man #2:
That's me!

41:53.845 --> 41:55.882
I'm sorry that you had to see that.

41:56.056 --> 41:59.014
Shut the fuck up, Dan, and get her
the fuck away from here-- now!

41:59.184 --> 42:01.516
Come on.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.553
I'm sorry, Mr. Swearengen.

42:08.318 --> 42:10.229
I warned him not to look at her.

42:10.404 --> 42:12.395
I warned him.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.699
Fucking PUSSY-

42:20.038 --> 42:22.826
Jane:
That Joey passed this afternoon.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.616
Been suffering awful.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.207
But that frog-looking fellow left the tent

42:29.381 --> 42:31.418
that I found up in the woods,

42:31.591 --> 42:34.674
left the tent a fucking cure
pronounced by the doc himself.

42:34.845 --> 42:39.385
And in the dumbest looking outfit
a grown man ever wore.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.889
Who's there, God damn it?!

42:44.062 --> 42:46.144
Who the hell's it look like?

42:47.983 --> 42:51.567
How the fuck do I know who it
fucking looks like? It's dark!

42:54.740 --> 42:58.483
Jesus Christ, come upon a person
unawares in a fucking graveyard!

43:11.465 --> 43:13.923
I heard you was back in the camp.

43:18.054 --> 43:21.592
I heard you and that Bullock got
the cocksucker did for Bill.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.853
Was Bill dead
by the time you saw him?

43:29.399 --> 43:31.606
Yeah, he was already dead.

43:34.404 --> 43:37.396
Why did he let that
son of a bitch get to him?

43:37.574 --> 43:39.281
I don't know, Charlie.

43:41.161 --> 43:44.119
Anyways, people don't
scare me past speaking,

43:44.289 --> 43:46.951
I come up here nights
tell him the fucking news.

44:04.226 --> 44:06.388
Go ahead.

44:18.824 --> 44:21.236
Charlie avenged
your fucking murder.

44:21.409 --> 44:24.902
And that Bullock fella was with me
that you seemed to like.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.367
Although it occurred to me
to wonder why they didn't do

44:27.541 --> 44:29.498
for the cocksucker
right on the fucking spot.

44:29.668 --> 44:31.955
Is that something we need
to get into in front of him?

44:32.128 --> 44:35.792
You got the biggest mouth
in the territory. You talk to him.

44:35.966 --> 44:38.082
Tell him whatever you want.

44:43.932 --> 44:47.345
I got that mail route in Cheyenne
that we talked about.

44:49.855 --> 44:52.938
I was bringing back supplies
to them hardware boys

44:53.108 --> 44:55.520
and I run into that Bullock fella.

44:56.570 --> 44:59.983
He was out there looking
for that McCall

45:00.156 --> 45:02.067
that-- that killed you.

45:03.159 --> 45:06.197
And he run into some heathen boy

45:06.371 --> 45:08.863
and he had one hell of a fight.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.499
Boy, and he just-- he got--

45:12.669 --> 45:14.376
he got f--

45:14.546 --> 45:16.537
he got f-f--

45:17.549 --> 45:19.381
Fuck.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.557
Can I--

45:26.641 --> 45:28.757
can I tell him some more
tomorrow?

45:29.895 --> 45:31.886
Sure. What the fuck
you asking me for?

45:32.063 --> 45:33.804
I don't make the rules.

45:38.069 --> 45:40.231
Wanna go back to the camp?

45:41.281 --> 45:43.113
Please.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.834
And what must Mr. Bullock
have been thinking

45:57.005 --> 46:00.168
as I inflicted my personal
confidences upon him?

46:00.342 --> 46:03.175
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.

46:03.345 --> 46:05.256
At least he kept a decent privacy.

46:08.141 --> 46:09.973
I have to go back to The Gem.

46:12.062 --> 46:14.804
He's waiting for me now to tell him

46:14.981 --> 46:17.814
yours and Mr. Bullock's
thinking about selling the claim,

46:17.984 --> 46:20.021
and I won't be able to lie anymore.

46:20.195 --> 46:22.186
Next I tell will be my last.

46:22.364 --> 46:24.446
So I betterjust get back there.

46:24.616 --> 46:26.948
Mr. Swearengen discovered
our deception?

46:27.118 --> 46:28.825
- Yeah.
- How?

46:28.995 --> 46:32.363
- Looking at you walk out the fucking hotel.
- He did not.

46:32.540 --> 46:35.578
I was careful to see he wasn't
watching in the window.

46:35.752 --> 46:39.290
It don't matter, Mrs. Garret.

46:39.464 --> 46:41.831
The point is, I gotta go back.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.999
And you need someone
to look to this child.

46:44.177 --> 46:47.545
And with choices bigger elsewhere
and nothing I can tell to hold you here,

46:47.722 --> 46:50.305
maybe you better think about
selling and getting out.

46:50.475 --> 46:53.558
Would you wanna
take the girl and go?

46:55.146 --> 46:56.853
Where?

46:58.316 --> 47:02.310
- I have no people anywhere.
- You could go to New York.

47:02.487 --> 47:06.196
I could have my relatives there
see you established.

47:06.366 --> 47:08.448
What the fuck?

47:10.537 --> 47:13.120
What would keep you here?

47:13.289 --> 47:15.576
You wanna fuck this man?

47:17.335 --> 47:20.748
Fuck him,
then think about the child--

47:20.922 --> 47:23.505
Don't use that language with me,
Trixie, or that tone.

47:23.675 --> 47:26.508
Don't you wanna say
to remember my place?

47:27.637 --> 47:29.969
I do, you rich cunt,

47:30.140 --> 47:32.222
and I'm going back to it.

47:42.652 --> 47:44.734
She's about to say
her name, you know.

47:46.990 --> 47:49.903
She named her sisters and her folks.

47:50.076 --> 47:52.192
Think of selling.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.578
If you took her away,
you could hear her say it.
