WEBVTT

00:01.372 --> 00:02.373
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.373 --> 00:03.374
DADDY!

00:03.374 --> 00:05.136
(Emily) WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

00:05.136 --> 00:06.177
MY FATHER WAS FRAMED FOR
A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

00:06.177 --> 00:07.007
DADDY!

00:07.007 --> 00:08.509
AMANDA!
 YOU CAN'T STAY.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
I DON'T REMEMBER ASKING YOU
FOR YOUR PERMISSION.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.085
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO GET YOU
TO STOP SEEING MY DAUGHTER?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.047
OH, MY GOD.

00:16.047 --> 00:17.118
AMANDA?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.419
I WANT TO COME HOME, JACK.

00:20.191 --> 00:22.093
(Nolan) Tyler got hold
of a shredded speech

00:22.093 --> 00:24.095
exposing Conrad and Victoria.

00:24.095 --> 00:26.457
THIS IS SATOSHI TAKEDA.

00:26.457 --> 00:27.698
I FEAR I'M LOSING CONTROL.

00:27.698 --> 00:30.661
REVENGE IS A STONY PATH.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.664
(grunting)

00:37.368 --> 00:38.409
(grunts)

00:38.409 --> 00:39.470
AH.

00:39.470 --> 00:40.571
(grunts)

00:40.571 --> 00:42.813
YOU REMEMBER WELL.

00:42.813 --> 00:46.177
ONE THING YOU CAN COUNT ON,
I NEVER FORGET.

00:46.177 --> 00:48.179
(pants)

00:51.122 --> 00:52.123
(grunts)

00:53.424 --> 00:54.585
(chuckles)

00:54.585 --> 00:55.756
(grunts)

00:55.756 --> 00:57.188
(grunts)

00:57.188 --> 00:59.360
HOW DOES IT FEEL
NOW THAT YOUR TARGETS

00:59.360 --> 01:03.164
ARE NO LONGER MEER IDEAS,
BUT FLESH AND BONE?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.194
(pants)

01:05.596 --> 01:09.170
(speaking Japanese)

01:09.170 --> 01:10.841
(sighs and speaks indistinctly)

01:10.841 --> 01:12.143
(gasps)

01:12.143 --> 01:13.804
(grunts)

01:13.804 --> 01:15.346
THE TASK IN FRONT OF YOU

01:15.346 --> 01:17.678
REQUIRES ABSOLUTE FOCUS.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.510
(grunts)

01:20.611 --> 01:22.513
(grunts and pants)

01:22.513 --> 01:24.655
IF YOU LET YOUR EMOTIONS
GUIDE YOU,

01:24.655 --> 01:27.158
YOU WILL FAIL.

01:27.158 --> 01:29.760
(speaks Japanese)

01:29.760 --> 01:31.262
(speaks Japanese)

01:33.224 --> 01:36.697
PRIORITIZE THE OBSTACLES
TO YOUR END GOAL.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.229
ELIMINATE THEM...

01:38.229 --> 01:40.231
ONE AT A TIME.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.834
(both grunt)

01:43.834 --> 01:45.306
(pants)

01:45.306 --> 01:46.877
THERE ARE TWO OF THEM.

01:46.877 --> 01:48.108
(pants)

01:48.108 --> 01:51.382
TYLER. HE'S SIMPLE,
OR OUGHTA BE.

01:51.382 --> 01:53.214
AND THEN THERE'S AMANDA.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.447
(sighs)
SHE'S A TICKING TIME BOMB.

01:56.447 --> 01:58.889
THEN YOU MUST STAY CLEAR
OF THE BLAST.

01:58.889 --> 02:00.191
HOW?

02:00.191 --> 02:01.792
(grunts)

02:01.792 --> 02:03.594
(both grunting)

02:03.594 --> 02:07.127
ENGAGE YOUR ULTIMATE OPPONENT
TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.199
UGH!

02:08.199 --> 02:11.562
(pants)

02:11.562 --> 02:13.204
VICTORIA?

02:13.204 --> 02:15.166
(pants)

02:20.441 --> 02:22.173
VICTORIA,

02:22.173 --> 02:23.574
GOOD MORNING.

02:23.574 --> 02:25.376
I MADE A BREAKFAST RESERVATION
FOR US

02:25.376 --> 02:26.817
SO WE COULD CONTINUE
OUR DISCUSSION

02:26.817 --> 02:28.148
FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.480
TODAY IS NOT A GOOD DAY,

02:29.480 --> 02:33.424
AND PLEASE CONTINUE
ADDRESSING ME ASMS.GRAYSON.

02:33.424 --> 02:36.187
OKAY, MY APOLOGIES.

02:36.187 --> 02:37.428
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

02:37.428 --> 02:40.561
CONRAD FILED FOR DIVORCE.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.162
I'VE HAD BETTER MORNINGS.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.795
WELL, DON'T WORRY. I'M SURE
YOU'LL COME OUT ON TOP.

02:44.795 --> 02:46.397
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

02:46.397 --> 02:48.299
WELL,
YOU'RE VICTORIA GRAYSON.

02:48.299 --> 02:49.800
YOU HAVE TWO CHILDREN
WHO LOVE YOU,

02:49.800 --> 02:51.502
FRIENDS WHO WOULD
DO ANYTHING FOR YOU,

02:51.502 --> 02:54.775
AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY
THAT WORSHIPS YOU.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.407
AND YOU HAVE ME.

02:56.407 --> 02:57.808
ANYTHING YOU NEED,

02:57.808 --> 02:59.250
I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.712
CAN YOU BRING MY SON HOME
TO ME?

03:01.712 --> 03:05.256
I CAN CERTAINLY TRY.

03:05.256 --> 03:06.817
THANK YOU.

03:07.958 --> 03:10.190
ASHLEY.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.492
VICTORIA'S FINE.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.968
(sighs)

03:17.968 --> 03:19.470
(knock on door)

03:19.470 --> 03:20.571
(doorknob rattles)

03:20.571 --> 03:22.233
(Ashley) TYLER,
ARE YOU DECENT?

03:22.233 --> 03:24.375
OR MORE IMPORTANTLY,
ALONE?

03:24.375 --> 03:26.237
YEAH, COME ON IN.
(sighs)

03:26.237 --> 03:27.408
I WASN'T SURE I'D SEE YOU

03:27.408 --> 03:29.240
AFTER YOUR FREAK-OUT
AT THE INVESTMENT PARTY.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.442
FREAK-OUT?
I LET YOU OFF EASY.

03:31.442 --> 03:32.783
ONE MINUTE
I'M UNDER THE IMPRESSION

03:32.783 --> 03:34.415
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE
A FUTURE TOGETHER,

03:34.415 --> 03:37.548
AND THE NEXT I CATCH YOU
LIP-LOCKED WITH NOLAN ROSS.

03:37.548 --> 03:41.592
YEAH, WELL, AS UNPLEASANT
AS THAT WAS FOR YOU AND ME,

03:41.592 --> 03:44.295
THE EXTRA BIT OF ATTENTION
I PAID NOLAN

03:44.295 --> 03:45.956
WAS DONE WITH OUR FUTURE
IN MIND.

03:45.956 --> 03:48.729
NOLAN'S $20 MIL
IS BEING WIRED AS WE SPEAK.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.931
AND I'M HEADED IN
TO COLLECT MY COMMISSION.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.264
200 LARGE.

03:53.264 --> 03:56.467
YOU KISS A BILLIONAIRE ONCE,
YOU MAKE 200 GRAND.

03:56.467 --> 03:58.339
I HAVE BEEN KISSING
VICTORIA'S ASS ALL SUMMER,

03:58.339 --> 04:00.841
AND I'M LUCKY IF SHE LETS ME
CALL HER BY HER FIRST NAME.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.543
(chuckles)

04:02.543 --> 04:04.275
SO LET ME SHARE THE WEALTH.

04:04.275 --> 04:07.418
I HAVE A 9:00 RESERVATION
AT DRIFTWOOD TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:07.418 --> 04:09.420
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU
WHAT A HARD GET THAT IS.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.352
SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN BI?

04:11.352 --> 04:12.483
MM.

04:12.483 --> 04:13.984
WHAT I AM IS AMBITIOUS.

04:13.984 --> 04:17.488
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT,
THEN WE PART AS FRIENDS.

04:17.488 --> 04:20.361
BUT IF I WERE YOU, I'D
STRONGLY CONSIDER JOINING ME.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.661
NOW THAT I HAVE
A FOOTHOLD WITH GRAYSON,

04:21.661 --> 04:23.664
I'M CLIMBING ALL THE WAY
TO THE TOP.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.536
AND THIS INVITATION...
(chuckles)

04:25.536 --> 04:27.368
IT WON'T BE OPEN FOREVER.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.039
(chuckles)

04:30.471 --> 04:31.542
(door closes)

04:31.542 --> 04:32.973
(Amanda) JACK?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.975
YOU IN HERE?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.307
(barking)
 WHOA.

04:36.307 --> 04:38.048
CHILL, CUJO.

04:38.048 --> 04:40.050
(continues barking)
 (Jack) SAMMY.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.983
STOP. STOP IT. COME HERE.
 (whines)

04:42.983 --> 04:45.386
SORRY. HE'S GOT ISSUES
WITH STRANGERS.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.287
APPARENTLY, HE DOESN'T
REMEMBER THAT YOU AREN'T ONE.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.589
WELL, IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.290
WELL, YEAH, AND HE'S

04:50.290 --> 04:52.292
MORE THAN A LITTLE SENILE.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.396
I WAS JUST BRINGING BREAKFAST
DOWN TO THE BOAT.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.997
YOU STILL LIKE
BLUEBERRY PANCAKES?

04:56.997 --> 05:00.371
(chuckles)
WHO DOESN'T LIKE PANCAKES?

05:04.475 --> 05:07.338
(sighs) I STILL REMEMBER
THE DAY I MET SAMMY.

05:07.338 --> 05:08.679
SAME DAY I MET YOU.

05:08.679 --> 05:10.441
(sighs)

05:10.441 --> 05:11.812
(laughs) ON THE BEACH...

05:11.812 --> 05:13.514
DOWN IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.346
WE PLAYED TUG-OF-WAR WITH HIM
AND PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD.

05:15.346 --> 05:16.647
SORRY, UM...

05:16.647 --> 05:20.020
MEMORY LANE ISN'T EXACTLY
A ROAD I LIKE TO GO DOWN.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.092
NO, NO, NO.
OF COURSE. OF COURSE.

05:22.092 --> 05:23.454
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.626
I, UH, SWIPED
ONE OF YOUR SHIRTS.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.458
LOOKS BETTER ON YOU
THAN ME.

05:27.458 --> 05:28.659
(laughs)

05:28.659 --> 05:30.761
SO DID YOU MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT STICKING AROUND?

05:30.761 --> 05:33.464
(clicks tongue) YEAH.

05:33.464 --> 05:35.335
BUT IF I'M GONNA STAY
IN THE HAMPTONS,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.037
I'M GONNA NEED
SOME NEW CLOTHES.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.539
WANT TO PICK SOME OUT
WITH ME?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.511
I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT

05:40.511 --> 05:42.042
HOW TO GET THE BAR
TO OPEN ITSELF.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.343
MM.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.875
(chuckles)

05:44.875 --> 05:48.419
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GOOD
IT FEELS TO HAVE YOU BACK.

05:50.521 --> 05:52.352
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU...

05:52.352 --> 05:55.586
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE
SOMEONE WAS THIS NICE TO ME.

05:56.827 --> 05:58.459
THANKS, JACK.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.831
YOU MAKE IT EASY.

06:02.893 --> 06:05.896
(Nolan)SOA QUICK RECAP

06:05.896 --> 06:07.738
IN CASE YOU'VE BEEN TOO BUSY
KNOCKING BOOTS

06:07.738 --> 06:09.540
WITH THE YOUNG GRAYSON
TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED

06:09.540 --> 06:11.802
ON LAST WEEK'S EPISODE
OF "THE TYLER CHRONICLES."

06:11.802 --> 06:14.475
I REMEMBER, NOLAN.
GET TO THE POINT.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.776
WELL, AFTER TYLER
FINISHED APOLOGIZING

06:15.776 --> 06:19.780
FOR TAKING MY CREDIT CARD
ON A PETTY THEFT CRIME SPREE,

06:19.780 --> 06:23.414
HE STARTED GOOGLE STALKING
ONE DAVID CLARKE.

06:23.414 --> 06:24.955
TAKE A LOOK.
 (clicks keyboard key)

06:24.955 --> 06:27.117
(whooshes)

06:27.117 --> 06:28.519
(whale cam clicks,
computer whooshes)

06:28.519 --> 06:30.791
NOW CHECK OUT
MY BROWSER HISTORY.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.392
(clicks keyboard keys,
computer chirps)

06:32.392 --> 06:34.595
HAVE YOU WIRED MONEY
OVER TO GRAYSON GLOBAL YET?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.567
HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK.

06:36.567 --> 06:40.400
$20 MILLION.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.572
PULL IT BACK.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.103
MM. I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.935
(chuckles) WHAT?

06:44.935 --> 06:46.437
IF I PULL MY MONEY

06:46.437 --> 06:49.540
AND CRUSH TYLER'S CHANCES
OF BECOMING A GRAYSON, EMS,

06:49.540 --> 06:50.511
WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.682
WELL, HOPEFULLY,

06:51.682 --> 06:53.183
HE'LL TRY TO BLACKMAIL CONRAD

06:53.183 --> 06:54.885
WITH WHAT'S IN THAT SPEECH.

06:54.885 --> 06:56.817
OH, REALLY?

06:56.817 --> 06:58.188
I DON'T KNOW.

06:58.188 --> 07:01.191
I THOUGHT YOU HAD BIGGER,
BADDER PLANS FOR THE GRAYSONS.

07:01.191 --> 07:02.523
I DO.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.825
LYDIA'S SPEECH CONTAINS
INFORMATION NOT EVIDENCE.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.126
AND LET'S NOT FORGET,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.759
TYLER NO LONGER HAS IT
IN HIS POSSESSION, WE DO.

07:08.759 --> 07:11.431
WHICH YOU NEVER
THANKED ME FOR, BY THE WAY.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.003
I'LL THANK YOU WHEN TYLER'S
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

07:13.003 --> 07:14.605
OH.

07:14.605 --> 07:15.706
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

07:15.706 --> 07:19.009
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN REASONS
FOR KEEPING HIM AROUND.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.440
(chuckles)

07:20.440 --> 07:24.545
I'LL CALL MY BUSINESS MANAGER
THIS AFTERNOON.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.446
HOW ABOUT...

07:26.446 --> 07:28.849
YOU CALL HIM NOW?

07:31.722 --> 07:33.784
(cell phone clicks and beeps)

07:35.726 --> 07:38.529
NOLAN ROSS FOR BARRY JOSSLIN.

07:41.061 --> 07:44.935
(Nolan) YEAH, IT'S ABOUT MONEY.
WHY ELSE WOULD I CALL?

07:44.935 --> 07:46.637

08:23.874 --> 08:25.075
(Daniel) MY FATHER
FILED FOR DIVORCE?

08:25.075 --> 08:26.206
WHY WOULDN'T HE
HAVE TOLD ME THIS MORNING?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.638
WHO KNOWS?

08:27.638 --> 08:30.210
BUT YOUR POOR MOTHER
IS BESIDE HERSELF.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.942
SHE REALLY NEEDS YOU
RIGHT NOW, DANIEL.

08:31.942 --> 08:33.283
IN FACT, SHE WAS HOPING
YOU'D JOIN HER FOR LUNCH.

08:33.283 --> 08:35.115
HEY.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.986
PERFECT TIMING.
 (mouths word)

08:36.986 --> 08:38.919
PLEASE JOIN ME FOR LUNCH
TODAY WITH MY MOTHER.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.221
YEAH, OF COURSE.
JUST TELL ME WHEN AND WHERE.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.224

08:44.224 --> 08:46.827
I'LL MODIFY THE RESERVATION

08:46.827 --> 08:47.998
BYE.

08:47.998 --> 08:51.131
THANKS, ASH.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.063
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:53.063 --> 08:56.236
IT SOUNDS LIKE MY PARENTS
ARE FINALLY GETTING A DIVORCE.

08:56.236 --> 09:00.270
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY, DANIEL.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.872
THEY SEEMED...

09:01.872 --> 09:04.544
SO PERFECT TOGETHER.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.749
YEAH,
MAYBE A LONG TIME AGO.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.621
WELL,
MAYBE THEY'LL WORK IT OUT.

09:10.621 --> 09:12.222
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?
IT MIGHT EVEN

09:12.222 --> 09:13.924
STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH BOTH OF THEM.

09:13.924 --> 09:16.556
YEAH, WITH MY MOM,

09:20.230 --> 09:22.562
WELL, IT'S HARD TO ARGUE
CONSIDERING THAT MY DAD'S

INVESTED WITH YOUR FATHER

TYLER'S BLACKMAILING HIM.

18:38.748 --> 18:41.251
INSTEAD YOU'RE SHELLING PEANUTS
IN SOME DIVE BAR

18:41.251 --> 18:45.124
WHERE, LET'S FACE IT,
NOBODY WANTS YOU.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.297
WELL, I THINK JACK
WOULD DISAGREE.

18:47.297 --> 18:48.798
EMILY, TOO.

18:48.798 --> 18:51.861
SHE'S REALLY EMBRACING THE IDEA
OF HAVING ME AROUND,

18:51.861 --> 18:55.535
EVEN AGREED THAT I'D CONTINUE
USING HER NAME.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.636
AW.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.768
SOMEBODY'S JEALOUS.

18:58.768 --> 19:01.241
(Declan) YEAH,
THERE ARE TWO ON THE LEASE.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.273
IT'S ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:03.273 --> 19:07.177
NO, I'LL BE 18 BY THE END
OF THE MONTH, SO IT'S...

19:07.177 --> 19:09.519
LET ME CALL YOU RIGHT BACK.

19:09.519 --> 19:11.321
(cell phone beeps
and clatters)

19:11.321 --> 19:12.282
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

19:12.282 --> 19:13.483
UM...

19:13.483 --> 19:15.625
ME AND CHARLOTTE ARE GETTING
A PLACE TOGETHER.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.227
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT?

19:17.227 --> 19:18.458
LOOK, THINK ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.460
YOU AND ME ARE CROWDING
EACH OTHER UP HERE.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.232
AND--AND THINGS ARE MOVING
FORWARD WITH YOU AND AMANDA,

19:22.232 --> 19:23.863
SO IT'S--
WE NEED PRIVACY.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.235
DECLAN, LISTEN TO ME.

19:25.235 --> 19:26.196
THIS IS
A SPECTACULARLY BAD IDEA

19:26.196 --> 19:27.367
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.738
YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

19:28.738 --> 19:30.300
YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED
HIGH SCHOOL.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.641
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

19:31.641 --> 19:32.802
GONNA BE A BAR BACK
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

19:32.802 --> 19:34.244
I'M DROWNING DOWNSTAIRS

19:34.244 --> 19:35.745
'CAUSE YOU CAN BARELY EVEN
DO THAT RIGHT.
 OKAY.

19:35.745 --> 19:38.208
HIRE SOMEONE ELSE.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.850
I'VE GOT MY OWN MONEY,
AND CHARLOTTE NEEDS ME.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.552
SHE NEEDS YOU?
 YEAH.

19:42.552 --> 19:45.255
DECLAN, YOU'RE JUST A KID.

19:45.255 --> 19:48.258
WHAT YOU NEED IS TO FINISH
HIGH SCHOOL, GO TO COLLEGE.

19:48.258 --> 19:50.460
YOU NEED TO MAKE YOURSELF
INTO THE KIND OF MAN

19:50.460 --> 19:52.492
THAT A GIRL LIKE
CHARLOTTE GRAYSON DESERVES.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.693
IF SHE'S STILL AROUND
AFTER THAT,

19:53.693 --> 19:54.864
THEN YOU GUYS CAN TALK ABOUT
HAVING A FUTURE.

19:54.864 --> 19:56.666
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE JUST...

19:56.666 --> 19:58.768
YOU'RE JUST THROWING
BOTH OF YOURS AWAY.

19:58.768 --> 20:01.771
♪♪♪

20:04.203 --> 20:06.676
YOUR CRUSADE FOR A FUTURE BUILT
ON SUSTAINED, RENEWABLE ENERGY

20:06.676 --> 20:08.378
IS ADMIRABLE

20:08.378 --> 20:10.280
AND A CAUSE
I PROUDLY STAND BEHIND.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.283
(speaking Japanese)

20:17.247 --> 20:20.219
(speaking Japanese)

20:20.219 --> 20:22.592
HE SAYS THAT HE...

20:22.592 --> 20:23.893
IS IMPRESSED BY YOUR RESEARCH

20:23.893 --> 20:25.895
AND RESPECTS
YOUR BUSINESS ETHICS.

20:25.895 --> 20:27.897
WELL, IT'S WHAT HE CAN EXPECT
ON A DAILY BASIS

20:27.897 --> 20:31.431
SHOULD HE CHOOSE TO TRUST ME
WITH HIS BUSINESS.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.434
(speaking Japanese)

20:40.239 --> 20:43.242
(speaking Japanese)

20:54.424 --> 20:55.525
(sighs)

20:55.525 --> 20:58.388
(speaks Japanese)

21:03.533 --> 21:05.765
(speaks Japanese)

21:11.441 --> 21:13.803
SO HE'S STILL ON THE FENCE?

21:16.976 --> 21:18.448
NO.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.880
WHAT DID HE SAY?

21:20.880 --> 21:24.454
HE'S AGREED
TO INVEST WITH YOU.

21:24.454 --> 21:26.356
$50 MILLION. (laughs)

21:26.356 --> 21:29.859
(laughing)

21:32.522 --> 21:34.524
WHEW.

21:39.769 --> 21:41.901
(Nolan) WHAT,

21:41.901 --> 21:45.875
NO SYNCHRONIZED SWIM
WITH YOUR SECRET SHARER?

21:45.875 --> 21:49.709
SINGLE WHITE FEMALE TOLD ME
YOU INVITED HER INTO THE FOLD.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.980
WHAT, I'M GUESSING

21:50.980 --> 21:53.413
THIS IS A KEEP YOUR FRENEMIES
CLOSE TYPE SITUATION?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.944
AT LEAST SHE'S
UNDER CONTROL, NOLAN.

21:54.944 --> 21:57.817
THAT'S MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR YOU AND TYLER.

21:59.849 --> 22:01.821
ABOUT THAT. UH...

22:01.821 --> 22:04.854
WELL, OPERATION TYLER HIT
A BIT OF A SPEED BUMP AND--

22:04.854 --> 22:06.556
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

22:06.556 --> 22:09.098
I'VE GOT THAT
UNDER CONTROL, TOO.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.331
BYE, NOLAN.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.968
(Conrad)
WHILE WE'RE BUYING THE UPSIDE,

22:18.968 --> 22:21.571
WE'RE SHORTING
THE POOREST PERFORMERS

22:21.571 --> 22:22.812
IN THAT SECTOR.

22:22.812 --> 22:24.444
SIMULTANEOUSLY COLLECTING
THE BEST IN BREED

22:24.444 --> 22:25.745
AND WEEDING OUT
THE RUNTS.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.747
YOU CATCH ON FAST, SON.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.118
(both laugh)

22:29.118 --> 22:30.480
TYLER, DAD.
 AH.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.021
THERE HE IS,
THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

22:32.021 --> 22:33.022
AH.

22:33.022 --> 22:34.524
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

22:34.524 --> 22:38.027
DANIEL MANAGED TO GET MR. TAKEDA
TO INVEST LAST NIGHT.

22:38.027 --> 22:39.489
$50 MILLION.

22:39.489 --> 22:41.090
(indistinct conversations)

22:41.090 --> 22:43.092
HOW'S THAT CORNER OFFICE
LOOKING FOR YOU NOW?

22:43.092 --> 22:45.765
$50 MILLION. WOW.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.537
SHAME YOU WON'T BE
GETTING COMMISSIONED.

22:47.537 --> 22:48.768
UM, YEAH.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.040
THAT COMMISSION WAS
A ONETIME INCENTIVE.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.702
TYLER DID BEAT YOU
TO THE PUNCH.

22:52.702 --> 22:54.704
BUT YOU KEEP TAKING
INITIATIVE LIKE THAT,

22:54.704 --> 22:57.807
AND I PROMISE,
COMMISSIONS WILL ABOUND.

22:57.807 --> 22:59.779
(Tyler) THAT'S RIGHT.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.712
SO LONG AS YOUR CLIENTS
ARE ALL JAPANESE.

23:02.712 --> 23:06.756
DON'T FORGET TO CUT IN
YOUR PRETTY BLONDE TRANSLATOR.

23:11.020 --> 23:13.693
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN LET HIM GET TO YOU.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.696
ENVY CAN BE
A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.827
MM.

23:17.827 --> 23:20.500
I DON'T ENVY TYLER, DAD.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.502
(indistinct conversations
continue)

23:22.502 --> 23:24.734
(front desk bell dings)

23:24.734 --> 23:25.905
IN FACT...

23:26.976 --> 23:28.808
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW

23:28.808 --> 23:31.781
ABOUT HOW HE GOT NOLAN ROSS
TO INVEST WITH YOUR COMPANY.

23:31.781 --> 23:32.842
(Amanda) GOOD BOY, SAMMY.

23:32.842 --> 23:35.144
GOOD BOY. YEAH.
 (barks)

23:35.144 --> 23:36.686
ATTABOY, SAMMY.
 (laughs)

23:36.686 --> 23:38.788
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S MEMORY
IS COMING BACK.

23:38.788 --> 23:41.551
SAM'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

23:41.551 --> 23:45.054
I FOUND THIS
ON THE BEACH THIS MORNING.

23:45.054 --> 23:46.626
IT REMINDED ME
OF HOW YOU AND I

23:46.626 --> 23:47.997
USED TO COLLECT
THAT SEA GLASS.

23:47.997 --> 23:49.799
YOU HAD A THING
FOR THE BLUE.

23:49.799 --> 23:53.132
WE BURIED JARS OF THAT STUFF
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.905
SAID IT WAS
OUR SECRET TREASURE, REMEMBER?

23:55.905 --> 23:57.837
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

23:57.837 --> 24:02.011
(man) ♪ I WON'T
EVER BE ALONE AGAIN ♪

24:02.011 --> 24:04.173
(Ryan) I WAS VERY HAPPY
TO GET YOUR CALL, VICTORIA.

24:04.173 --> 24:06.516
I'M VERY AWARE OF THE JOB
YOU DID FOR MICHAEL

24:06.516 --> 24:08.548
IN HIS DIVORCE
AGAINST LYDIA.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.849
AND I THINK
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH OF ME

24:09.849 --> 24:11.951
NOT TO CONSIDER
YOUR COUNSEL.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.683
THANK YOU.

24:13.683 --> 24:16.556
IT SEEMS MY REPUTATION
PRECEDES ME.

24:16.556 --> 24:19.629
(chuckles) I SAW MICHAEL
EARLIER THIS SUMMER,

24:19.629 --> 24:22.562
ALREADY WITH A PRETTY
YOUNG WOMAN AT HIS ARM.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.993
I TRUST HE'S DOING WELL?

24:23.993 --> 24:25.595
ENGAGED.

24:25.595 --> 24:26.796
GOD HELP HIM.

24:26.796 --> 24:28.938
OBVIOUSLY,
HIS HEART IS FARING

24:28.938 --> 24:30.740
A LITTLE BIT BETTER
THAN LYDIA'S.

24:30.740 --> 24:33.202
COULDN'T HELP BUT FEEL BADLY
WHEN I HEARD THAT SHE HAD

24:33.202 --> 24:35.044
JUMPED FROM HER BALCONY.

24:35.044 --> 24:38.177
WELL,
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.610
WELL, BEFORE WE DISCUSS
MY FEE,

24:40.610 --> 24:44.584
I'LL NEED YOU TO AGREE TO
SOME NONNEGOTIABLE CONDITIONS.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.885
I SEE.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.587
FIRST CONDITION--

24:47.587 --> 24:51.761
NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER
WITH YOUR SPOUSE, STARTING NOW.

24:51.761 --> 24:54.063
THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.
(laughs)

24:54.063 --> 24:55.795
SECOND--

24:55.795 --> 24:59.498
I NEED ABSOLUTE FINANCIAL
TRANSPARENCY FROM YOU--

24:59.498 --> 25:01.831
BANK ACCOUNTS, LOCK BOXES,

25:01.831 --> 25:04.133
PLANES, HOUSES, JEWELRY.

25:05.775 --> 25:07.837
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THE DRAMATIC PAUSES,

25:07.837 --> 25:09.508
MR. HUNTLEY.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.742
IF I DISAGREE WITH YOUR TERMS,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

25:12.742 --> 25:13.783
FINALLY,

25:13.783 --> 25:15.745
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

25:15.745 --> 25:18.147
I NEED YOU TO BE WILLING
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

25:18.147 --> 25:19.749
TO WIN YOUR CASE,

25:19.749 --> 25:22.521
WHICH COULD MEAN YOU END UP
WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

25:22.521 --> 25:24.994
OF CONRAD'S BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS
BY THE TIME THIS IS OVER.

25:24.994 --> 25:27.927
I WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

25:31.701 --> 25:32.832
(bead curtain clatters)

25:32.832 --> 25:34.764
HEY. WE'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR OUR APARTMENT MEETINGS.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.306
WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE LATE, CHARLOTTE,

25:37.306 --> 25:38.968
BECAUSE I CANCELED 'EM.

25:38.968 --> 25:40.840
YOU DON'T WANT
TO MOVE IN WITH ME?

25:40.840 --> 25:45.645
I-I'VE NEVER WANTED
ANYTHING MORE.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.147
BUT IT CAN'T BE
LIKE THIS.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.620
YOU--YOU HAVE A NICE LIFE
CARVED OUT FOR YOU HERE.

25:50.620 --> 25:51.881
YEAH, AND YOU'RE A PART
OF IT NOW.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.883
YEAH. I WANT TO BE
A PART OF IT FOREVER.

25:53.883 --> 25:57.086
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA LAST,
THEN I HAVE TO FINISH SCHOOL.

25:57.086 --> 26:00.830
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE GO TO COLLEGE.

26:00.830 --> 26:03.963
YOU DESERVE A GUY
LIKE THAT.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.234
WELL,

26:05.234 --> 26:07.236
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS JUST FOR ME.

26:07.236 --> 26:08.938
WELL, I'M NOT.

26:08.938 --> 26:10.900
I'M DOING IT FOR US.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.702
HERE'S YOUR MOM'S CHECK.

26:12.702 --> 26:15.244
KEEP IT.

26:15.244 --> 26:18.908
THINK OF IT AS MY MOTHER'S
INVESTMENT IN YOUR FUTURE.

26:18.908 --> 26:20.349
IT'S NOT MY STYLE.

26:20.349 --> 26:22.011
I'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.919
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, SIR?

26:29.919 --> 26:31.360
YEAH.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.862
IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION

26:32.862 --> 26:34.924
YOU GARNERED MR. ROSS' SUPPORT

26:34.924 --> 26:38.798
THROUGH LESS-THAN-HONORABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES.

26:38.798 --> 26:42.231
SO YOUR TIME HERE
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL IS OVER.

26:42.231 --> 26:45.034
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
WHO CARES HOW I GOT HIM?

26:45.034 --> 26:46.906
$20 MILLION
FROM A GUY THAT

26:46.906 --> 26:49.078
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO LAND
FOR A DECADE IS HARDLY--

26:49.078 --> 26:51.841
THIS COMPANY'S WORTH
OVER 200 TIMES THAT,

26:51.841 --> 26:54.914
WHICH IS WHY WE TRY TO AVOID
SCANDAL AT ALL COST.

26:54.914 --> 26:58.017
BLACKMAILING A POTENTIAL CLIENT
INTO A PORTFOLIO

26:58.017 --> 27:00.920
FALLS DIRECTLY
INTO THE SCANDALOUS CATEGORY.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.121
BLACKMAIL?

27:02.121 --> 27:04.153
THE SEX TAPE YOU MADE
WITH NOLAN ROSS?

27:04.153 --> 27:05.995
(chuckles) SEX TAPE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:05.995 --> 27:07.697
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

27:07.697 --> 27:08.928
YOU'RE FIRED.

27:13.062 --> 27:14.403
AM I?

27:16.405 --> 27:20.069
AT LEAST WHEN I DO BUSINESS,
PEOPLE DON'T DIE.

27:20.069 --> 27:22.211
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

27:22.211 --> 27:24.844
YOU WANT A SCANDAL?

27:24.844 --> 27:27.316
YOU FIRE ME,
AND I TELL THE WORLD

27:27.316 --> 27:29.218
THAT YOU AND YOUR WIFE
WERE THE REAL REASON

27:29.218 --> 27:31.650
ALL THOSE PEOPLE DIED
ON FLIGHT 197

27:31.650 --> 27:32.882
AND THAT
THAT GUY WHO WORKED FOR YOU,

27:32.882 --> 27:33.983
DAVID CLARKE,

27:33.983 --> 27:36.155
WAS JUST A PATSY.

27:37.687 --> 27:39.859
I'D THINK VERY CAREFULLY
ABOUT THE NEXT WORDS

27:39.859 --> 27:43.863
THAT COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,
MR. GRAYSON.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.100
(rustling)

27:51.100 --> 27:53.202
(exhales)

27:53.202 --> 27:55.404
EXCUSE ME.

27:55.404 --> 27:57.076
CAN I HELP YOU?

27:57.076 --> 27:59.348
I'M, UH,
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

27:59.348 --> 28:00.850
I BURIED AS A LITTLE KID.

28:00.850 --> 28:03.312
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S COOL FOR YOU TO BE HERE

28:03.312 --> 28:04.854
WITHOUT EMILY AROUND.

28:04.854 --> 28:07.286
WELL, EMILY SAID IT'S COOL,
SO...

28:07.286 --> 28:08.417
SHE DIDN'T MENTION IT TO ME,

28:08.417 --> 28:09.959
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
COME BACK WHEN SHE'S HERE.

28:09.959 --> 28:11.721
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ME?

28:11.721 --> 28:13.062
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

28:13.062 --> 28:15.364
EXACTLY.

28:15.364 --> 28:17.396
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.368
YOUR BOYFRIEND HERE IS TRYING
TO THROW ME OFF YOUR PROPERTY

28:19.368 --> 28:22.271
FOR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ME.

28:22.271 --> 28:23.773
NO, IT'S OKAY, DANIEL.

28:23.773 --> 28:26.335
UM, WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD, UH,
COME BACK TOMORROW MORNING,

28:26.335 --> 28:28.237
AND I'LL HELP YOU SEARCH
FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND.

28:29.779 --> 28:31.240
TOLD YOU SHE WAS COOL.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.186
THAT GIRL MAKES ME NERVOUS.

28:37.186 --> 28:40.850
SHE JUST SEEMS
A LITTLE... LOST TO ME.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.191
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE

28:42.191 --> 28:43.893
GROWING UP
THE WAY SHE HAD TO?

28:43.893 --> 28:46.856
JUST BE CAREFUL WITH HER.

28:46.856 --> 28:49.398
I WILL.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.404
(computer beeps)

28:55.404 --> 28:57.436
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:57.436 --> 28:58.808
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

28:58.808 --> 29:00.870
A 1-BEDROOM APARTMENT
IN MONTAUK?

29:00.870 --> 29:02.912
YOU'RE SPYING ON MY LAPTOP?

29:02.912 --> 29:04.443
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

29:05.815 --> 29:08.317
DECLAN AND I
WERE LOOKING FOR A PLACE.

29:08.317 --> 29:11.250
THOUGHT WE'D PUT
YOUR $25,000 BRIBE

29:11.250 --> 29:13.052
TO GOOD USE.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.753
THAT'S RIGHT, MOM.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.754
I KNOW YOU WERE TRYING
TO PAY HIM OFF,

29:15.754 --> 29:16.926
ONLY YOU COULDN'T,

29:16.926 --> 29:18.487
BECAUSE HE REALLY CARES
ABOUT ME.

29:18.487 --> 29:20.759
I'M SURE HE DOES.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.391
AND I'M SURE THAT YOU THINK
YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY, TOO,

29:22.391 --> 29:24.934
BUT BELIEVE ME, THIS IS
AN INSANELY BAD IDEA.

29:24.934 --> 29:27.096
WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?
WHAT ABOUT--

29:27.096 --> 29:29.168
RELAX, MOM. I'M NOT...
MOVING IN WITH DECLAN.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.870
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR
TO HIM.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.171
FAIR TO HIM?

29:32.171 --> 29:35.044
BECAUSE ALL I REALLY WANT
IS TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.

29:36.545 --> 29:38.007
I'M 17, MOM,

29:38.007 --> 29:39.809
AND DAD SAID IT'S PRETTY MUCH
UP TO ME

29:39.809 --> 29:42.411
WHO I WANT TO LIVE WITH.

29:42.411 --> 29:44.153
(voice breaking)
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

29:44.153 --> 29:46.355

29:59.999 --> 30:01.800

30:01.800 --> 30:03.402
WELL,
BECAUSE THERE'S NO LONGER

30:03.402 --> 30:05.434
ANY REASON TO CELEBRATE.

30:05.434 --> 30:08.077
I'M SORRY, TY.

30:08.077 --> 30:09.578
I'M PULLING MY INVESTMENT.

30:09.578 --> 30:12.111
UH, I'M HAVING
TOO MANY SECOND THOUGHTS.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.812
(chuckles)

30:15.945 --> 30:18.547
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING ME
THIS WHOLE TIME.

30:18.547 --> 30:22.451

30:22.451 --> 30:24.994

30:29.228 --> 30:31.060

30:31.060 --> 30:34.263

THAT YOU WOULD EXPOSE YOURSELF

30:34.263 --> 30:36.535

30:36.535 --> 30:39.308

BUT THEN...

30:39.308 --> 30:42.541
YOU UNDERESTIMATED ME, TOO.

30:42.541 --> 30:46.845

AS INSURANCE

30:46.845 --> 30:50.249
BECAUSE I DIDN'T TRUST YOU.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.851

COST FOR ME TO GET IT BACK?

38:56.034 --> 38:59.368
YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
DERAIL ME SINCE DAY ONE--

38:59.368 --> 39:01.370
TOYING WITH JACK'S HEART,

39:01.370 --> 39:03.942
BUYING HIS BOAT.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.874
AND NOW YOU SABOTAGED
OUR ALLIANCE

39:05.874 --> 39:07.716
BECAUSE YOU FELL
FOR A HOOKER.

39:07.716 --> 39:11.079
(chuckles)

39:11.079 --> 39:12.781
THE DIFFERENCE IS,

39:12.781 --> 39:17.025
THAT WHEN I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO EXPOSE YOU TODAY,

39:17.025 --> 39:18.727
I DIDN'T.

39:18.727 --> 39:20.389
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE,
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

39:20.389 --> 39:21.690
YOU KNOW I MEANT IT
WHEN I SAID

39:21.690 --> 39:24.663
THAT I WOULD TAKE YOU DOWN
IF YOU TRIED TO GET IN MY WAY.

39:27.636 --> 39:29.798
MESSAGE RECEIVED.

39:31.099 --> 39:34.102
I'M DONE PLAYING
YOUR EVIL GAMES.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.045
(door opens)

39:37.045 --> 39:39.778
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO BE A PART OF THIS.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.782
NO.

39:43.782 --> 39:47.085
YOUR FATHER DID.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.688
EMS, HE DIDN'T WANT THIS
FOR YOU.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.760
REMEMBER?

39:51.760 --> 39:54.423
IT'S GOOD THAT HE'S GONE.

39:55.864 --> 39:57.766
'CAUSE AT LEAST NOW
HE CAN'T SEE

39:57.766 --> 39:59.728
WHAT YOU'VE BECOME.

40:04.903 --> 40:08.036
(cell phone rings)

40:08.036 --> 40:10.809
(ring)

40:10.809 --> 40:12.781
(ring)

40:12.781 --> 40:14.783
(exhales)

40:14.783 --> 40:16.785
(ring)

40:16.785 --> 40:18.186
(rings and beeps)

40:18.186 --> 40:19.648
HI.

40:19.648 --> 40:22.120
HEY, UH, DID I JUST SEE
NOLAN LEAVING YOUR PLACE?

40:22.120 --> 40:23.822
YEAH, UM...

40:23.822 --> 40:25.123
HE HAD

40:25.123 --> 40:26.825
a pretty scary visit
from Tyler.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.797
He thinks Nolan
got him fired.

40:28.797 --> 40:31.560
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.
MY FATHER DIDN'T FIRE HIM.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.162
REALLY?

40:34.162 --> 40:36.465
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY?

40:36.465 --> 40:37.806
WHO KNOWS?

40:37.806 --> 40:39.468
I'VE JUST HAD ENOUGH
OF MY FATHER'S LIES.

40:39.468 --> 40:40.809
(sighs)

40:40.809 --> 40:42.971
LISTEN, ARE YOU OKAY WITH ME
STAYING WITH MY MOM TONIGHT?

40:42.971 --> 40:45.043
IF AND WHEN TYLER SHOWS UP,

40:45.043 --> 40:46.515
I don't want her here alone.

40:46.515 --> 40:49.047
(sighs) YEAH, THAT'S
PROBABLY A GREAT IDEA.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.879
I MEAN, YOU'RE WELCOME TO
COME OVER, TOO, IF YOU LIKE.

40:50.879 --> 40:52.881
GOT A GREAT VIEW
OF YOUR PORCH FROM UP HERE

40:52.881 --> 40:55.654
IN CASE AMANDA CLARKE
COMES DIGGING AROUND AGAIN.

40:55.654 --> 40:56.955
I can handle Amanda.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.857
You just look after your mom.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.228
AH, SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

41:00.228 --> 41:02.060
SHE HIRED A LAWYER TODAY.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.593
THAT'S GREAT.

41:06.735 --> 41:08.667
SLEEP TIGHT.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.769
Night.

41:10.769 --> 41:13.902
(beeps)

41:13.902 --> 41:15.844
DID I HEAR YOU SAY
AMANDA CLARKE?

41:15.844 --> 41:18.046
YEAH, SHE'S BACK IN TOWN
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

41:18.046 --> 41:19.978
STRANGE, RIGHT?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.852
(Emily) MY FATHER WROTE,

41:23.852 --> 41:26.855
"ALWAYS QUESTION
WHERE YOUR LOYALTIES LIE.

41:26.855 --> 41:29.718
"THE PEOPLE YOU TRUST
WILL EXPECT IT,

41:29.718 --> 41:32.691
"YOUR GREATEST ENEMIES
WILL DESIRE IT,

41:32.691 --> 41:33.862
"AND THOSE
YOU TREASURE THE MOST,

41:33.862 --> 41:36.825
WILL, WITHOUT FAIL,
ABUSE IT."

41:36.825 --> 41:38.697
(man's voice)
"DEAR MR. CLARKE,

41:38.697 --> 41:39.868
"I AM WRITING TO INFORM YOU

41:39.868 --> 41:41.730
"THAT I WILL NOT
BE MOVING FORWARD

41:41.730 --> 41:43.872
"WITH THE APPEAL
OF YOUR CONVICTION

41:43.872 --> 41:46.074
FOR THE CRIME OF TREASON."

41:46.074 --> 41:47.776
(door opens)

41:47.776 --> 41:48.937
(keys jangle)

41:48.937 --> 41:51.640
(blows air)

41:51.640 --> 41:52.681
(drops objects on desk)

41:52.681 --> 41:53.782
(keys jangle)

41:53.782 --> 41:54.783
RYAN HUNTLEY.

41:56.715 --> 41:57.886
WHO ARE YOU?

41:57.886 --> 41:58.987
AMANDA CLARKE.

41:58.987 --> 42:01.890
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

42:01.890 --> 42:04.092
THAT'S THE LEAST
OF YOUR PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.

42:06.955 --> 42:10.028
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOU DROPPED MY FATHER'S APPEAL.

42:12.300 --> 42:16.835
(Emily) SOME SAY LOYALTY
INSPIRES BOUNDLESS HOPE.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.567
AND WHILE THAT MAY BE,

42:18.567 --> 42:20.809
THERE IS A CATCH.

42:20.809 --> 42:25.143
TRUE LOYALTY
TAKES YEARS TO BUILD...

42:25.143 --> 42:27.946
AND ONLY SECONDS TO DESTROY.
