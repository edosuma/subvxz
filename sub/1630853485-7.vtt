00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.760
I just found this at the school.
I saw David there the other day.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.560
Rachel didn't deserve that,
whatever she did.

00:17.240 --> 00:20.040
The government have a care order
still active against you.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.480
It stops you from seeing David.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.640
Something happened at Winthorpe.
We both know it.

00:24.680 --> 00:29.640
Having consulted with the children,
it seems prudent to arrange

00:29.680 --> 00:31.960
their staggered
departure from Midwich.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.600
I don't want to leave you.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.600
Your mother is going to
miss you so much. She won't.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.520
None of you will.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.560
I will tell you everything
when I get home,

00:41.600 --> 00:43.440
I promise.
Ten o'clock, I'll be back.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.240
Hello? Hello?

01:06.760 --> 01:08.240
Sam?

01:16.080 --> 01:18.080
Cassie?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.960
Cassie!

01:25.840 --> 01:27.680
Cassie.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.120
OK. Now, Cassie,
we're gonna put this on.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.720
I just want you
to breathe for me, OK?

01:45.800 --> 01:48.080
That's right. Just breathe.
We're not far away, OK?

01:48.120 --> 01:51.880
What did she take?
I... What did she take?

01:51.920 --> 01:55.280
I... I don't know.
OK. That's fine. That's it.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.200
You're doing great, you're doing
really well, you're doing brilliant.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.520
You'll be all right.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.480
Yeah, like a Zebra. Can I get down?
Are we OK in here for a second?

02:37.520 --> 02:41.520
Can I get...? Of course you can.
You just play in there, OK, darling.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.720
Do you want some breakfast, love?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.680
We need to talk about Dad.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Where were you?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You said ten o'clock.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.880
I was at the school.
I got locked in.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
You just lie

04:13.040 --> 04:15.240
all the time.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.160
No, Cassie.
Mum, just go.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.560
It's always the same thing.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.720
I need you

04:34.760 --> 04:36.880
and you're not there.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.640
Get some rest.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.920
Hey.
Hey.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.600
How is she?
Er, physically, she's gonna be OK.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.760
They got most of it
out of her system but, er...

05:26.800 --> 05:28.800
I'm sorry.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.880
Where's Westcott?
He's gone to Winthorpe.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.200
Preparing the children's move.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.560
Paul, can I speak to you alone?
Susannah.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.840
I know there's something wrong.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.920
Can you speak to me too? Please.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.840
The Nordosk file, is it still here?

06:01.520 --> 06:03.520
Thanks.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.080
No survivors.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
What's going on?

07:04.120 --> 07:07.520
Mr Haynes went
to the school last night.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.480
So?

07:11.960 --> 07:14.240
We think you told him to go there.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.840
Hannah, he didn't say anything.
Don't lie.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.080
Are you trying to hurt us?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.120
Where's Ellie?

07:58.120 --> 08:01.400
Hannah, please. Please don't do
this. Who did the policeman go with?

08:01.440 --> 08:05.200
Ellie! What did he find?
Please, that is your sister! Hannah!

08:10.920 --> 08:14.160
Hannah, please, because she could
hurt herself. Then, tell me.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.280
Who did he go with, Dad?

08:22.320 --> 08:25.080
Was it Dr Zellaby?
Sam!

08:25.120 --> 08:27.200
Yes.

08:32.600 --> 08:38.080
Hiya, darling. It's OK.
You're OK, aren't you?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.840
Yeah.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.560
Think back to that day at Winthorpe.
What happened?

08:51.600 --> 08:54.400
We were in the testing room.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.080
And you felt sleepy, yes?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.960
Evie looked through the window.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.160
Towards the parade ground?
Yes. Towards the soldiers.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.800
And what about Westcott?
Did he fall asleep?

09:12.360 --> 09:15.200
Did you see him wake up?
I don't know.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.440
Well, think. Bryony, please think.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.960
No, I don't think so.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.280
And what happened when you woke up?

09:31.160 --> 09:34.800
There was a noise.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.000
Like a gunshot?

09:37.040 --> 09:39.040
Yes.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.640
Yeah. I heard that.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.960
Hi, Mum.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.920
What are you doing here?
Where's Granny?

10:25.440 --> 10:28.560
She's... She's gone. Why?

10:29.600 --> 10:32.280
Did you hurt yourself?

10:37.120 --> 10:39.120
Yeah.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.920
But I'm... I'm OK now.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.160
You have to contact London
and tell them what's happened.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.160
The children have taken over
a squadron of soldiers.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.760
Westcott is planning to help them.
Why?

11:04.800 --> 11:08.920
Because he is one of them.
What are you doing, Dr Zellaby?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.400
Hello, Joe.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.800
Er...

11:15.840 --> 11:20.480
I'm just talking to DCI Haynes
about my daughter.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.960
She's been taken unwell.
You should come with me.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Mum?
Mm?

11:28.040 --> 11:30.720
What did Granny tell you?

11:41.240 --> 11:44.360
Did she tell you
what she saw in the school?

11:45.760 --> 11:47.760
No.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.200
She didn't tell me anything,
I promise.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.240
You don't touch her, Joe.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.240
It's OK. I'm coming.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.840
OK, I'm coming.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.800
I'm coming.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Paul, wake up.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.800
What did you see at the school?
What do you know?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.840
Joe, listen to me.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.360
I'm your friend, I'm not your enemy.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.360
You're lying, Dr Zellaby.
No. No. I promise.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.480
I know nothing.
I know absolutely nothing.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.760
I haven't finished talking to you,
Dr Zellaby.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.280
Don't... Don't do this, Joe.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.920
Don't, Joe.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.400
Joe, Joe.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.160
Nathan?

14:03.440 --> 14:05.440
Nathan, are you OK?

14:07.160 --> 14:09.160
Nathan?

14:10.160 --> 14:13.560
What's going on? What hap...?

14:13.600 --> 14:15.120
Baby?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.200
Hannah?

14:23.240 --> 14:25.760
Evie? Evie?

14:25.800 --> 14:29.800
Evie, Evie, what's wrong? Evie,
what's wrong? Evie? I have to go.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.280
No. No. Please, please.
Please, Evie, please don't.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.920
Please don't leave me! Please.
Please, just wait.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.360
You... You can take me with you.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.520
Come on, soldier.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.240
Curtis!

15:31.840 --> 15:33.840
I'm taking him away.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.880
Please.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.000
You won't make it.
Why should I listen to you?

15:41.040 --> 15:43.320
They won't let you leave.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.000
They'll... They'll kill you
and they'll kill David.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.000
You brought them here.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.040
No.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.400
You did.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.600
Let... us...

16:15.960 --> 16:17.960
..go.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.800
Ugh!

16:24.120 --> 16:26.920
Ugh! Ugh-ugh!

16:26.960 --> 16:30.480
Ugh!
No! No! No! Ugh!

16:30.520 --> 16:33.760
Don't!
Ugh! Argh! Don't!

16:33.800 --> 16:35.280
No!

16:35.320 --> 16:36.560
Oh!

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
Excuse me,
have you seen my daughter?

18:15.880 --> 18:17.880
Cassie?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.640
Cassie!

18:20.640 --> 18:22.640
Cassie?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.680
Cassie!

18:29.400 --> 18:31.520
Yeah.
Hi, Granny.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.320
Evie, where's Cassie?
She's where she wants to be.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.680
Listen to me. Cassie took
pills last night. We know.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.760
She needs medical supervision.
She's coming with us to Winthorpe.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.520
She wants to leave. Listen to me.
You bring her back here right now.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.560
An army bus will
travel from Winthorpe

18:50.600 --> 18:53.720
to pick us up tomorrow morning.
Cassie will travel with us.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.520
She'll be safe as long
as you do as we say.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.880
Don't cause trouble.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.720
He rushed into the house,
he said he couldn't stay.

19:32.760 --> 19:37.480
Um, he said someone else
would come and pick up his stuff.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.160
He gave me this hug.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.200
It felt like he didn't
want to let go, you know.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.240
Then he just left.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.480
His eyes had nothing in them.
They were just empty.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.360
Then I found this.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.600
This is Nathan's?

20:08.360 --> 20:11.280
He doesn't want to be one of them,
I know he doesn't.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.760
So, why did he go with them?

20:15.800 --> 20:19.560
He's scared.
Then, why won't he talk to me?

20:20.560 --> 20:23.800
I'm his mother! I don't care
what they say. I'm his mother.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.040
Paul, you have to find him,

20:27.080 --> 20:29.080
bring him back.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.800
Promise me.

20:33.960 --> 20:37.560
I want you to go to my house.
Wait for me there.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.040
I'm gonna get him back, OK?

20:51.320 --> 20:53.440
We're one of the parents.
Go through.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.600
What's going on?

21:15.640 --> 21:19.520
Where's Hannah? Is she with you?
No, she just left the house.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.000
Lily-Grace did the same. I can't
find her anywhere. What is going on?

21:23.040 --> 21:27.040
I can't get Sunny on the phone.
Olive's gone. I can't find her.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.080
I overheard Bryony talking.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.440
The children have
locked themselves in the school.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.800
Let's get up there, all of us.
Er, let's just wait, Mary-Ann.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.800
For what? For them to leave?
He shot one of 'em, Sam.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.560
They have to know
we had nothing to do with this.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.960
Excuse me. What is going on?
Is it true? Are they at the school?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.800
We're getting more information
as soon as we can.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.640
Why is the army here?
Army?

21:51.680 --> 21:54.600
What army?
Yeah. They were in our street.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.640
You don't know what's happening,
do you?

21:57.680 --> 21:59.680
Oh, my God.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.600
Major Craig Seymour. Good afternoon.

22:16.640 --> 22:21.360
I have authority under the
Civil Contingencies Act 2004

22:21.400 --> 22:23.640
to take command of
the Ward 300 operation.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.480
I am implementing
a full curfew for tonight.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.840
Everyone is to return home
immediately and wait in their homes.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.400
Why? Wait for what?

22:34.920 --> 22:37.640
Just do as I say, please.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.680
Let's move these people out of here.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.720
Make sure they get home safely.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.560
Stairs right.

23:12.600 --> 23:17.440
We're looking for DCI Paul Haynes.
Is he here? What's going on?

23:19.680 --> 23:23.280
What's going on?
Where is DCI Haynes?

24:24.280 --> 24:26.920
You OK?
Yeah.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.000
You seen the soldiers?
Yeah. They're from Winthorpe.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.280
Blank faces. Nothing going on.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.320
Obeying orders.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.760
We need to stop this, Susannah.
I know.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.520
Yeah. I'm going to go in there.
I'm going to go into the school.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.840
No. Yeah, I'm gonna find a way.
I'm gonna speak to them.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.880
Paul, you can't...
you can't go in there

24:45.920 --> 24:48.800
because they'll do exactly
to you what they did to Curtis.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.920
Well, what the fuck are we gonna do?

25:02.160 --> 25:05.400
The children must not leave Midwich.

25:05.440 --> 25:10.120
If they reach Winthorpe, they'll
take control of another platoon

25:10.160 --> 25:12.480
and then the whole army.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.560
This is a takeover, Paul,
and we have to stop them.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.880
How?

25:21.760 --> 25:24.320
The children are taking
a military bus tomorrow morning.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.440
All of them will be on board.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.800
Wait, you're saying...?

25:33.840 --> 25:35.840
Yeah.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.880
This is our only chance.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Do you think you can do it?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.400
Where are you going?

25:49.440 --> 25:53.200
They have Cassie.
I have to stop her going with them.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.000
I have to try.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.040
Susannah.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.760
Nathan left me this.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.560
How did he write this
without them knowing?

26:17.600 --> 26:20.040
He uses pain to block the hive.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.080
He doesn't want to be
part of them any more.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.360
Get him out of there, please.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.120
Hello.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.440
Hello, Olive. How are you?

27:14.880 --> 27:16.880
You should be at home.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.600
I... I came to speak to Evie.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.280
I'm alone.

27:23.320 --> 27:27.480
You can't come in. Well, ask Evie
to come out then, would you?

27:27.520 --> 27:30.280
We are all Evie.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.320
No, darling.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.360
No, you're not. Not quite.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.640
What is this, Granny?
I want to come with you.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.600
I know that Cassie is in there
and I want to come too.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.920
You've caused us
enough trouble already.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.680
It was never my intention but
you lied to me about Mr Westcott.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.360
You never told me he was the only
survivor from the first landing.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.440
I know about the Winthorpe platoon.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.280
That you're using them
to expand your power

28:30.320 --> 28:32.600
so you can
take over here and then...

28:32.640 --> 28:34.720
And then who knows?

28:37.640 --> 28:41.120
So, you'll either have to
take me with you or kill me.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.360
It seems you know about me.
Yes.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.160
And now I understand why
they're so important to you.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.200
40 years is a long time to be alone.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.080
40 years is nothing
when you've lost everyone.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.760
My hive died,
burnt alive by your bombs.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.400
These children
are a superior evolution.

29:12.520 --> 29:18.160
But they are, for now, still
children. They need my protection.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.480
And they need mine.
I disagree. You are the threat.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.640
No. What threat?

29:23.680 --> 29:26.160
I love them.
I've always looked after them.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.120
I... I love them maybe
even more than you do.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.720
That's a lie.
No. No.

29:31.760 --> 29:35.280
It's not a lie.
I love you. I always have.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.560
You're human.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.400
Humans cheat and deceive.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.440
Lily-Grace, come out here!

29:43.480 --> 29:47.280
Front gates. What's happening?
Mary-Ann. Mary-Ann. Mary-Ann.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.200
Mum, what are you doing here?
Can you just leave me alone?

29:56.240 --> 29:59.240
I can't.
I don't want you here.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.640
If you reject me,
they won't just let me leave,

30:01.680 --> 30:04.280
they will kill me.
No, they won't. Lily-Grace!

30:04.320 --> 30:08.840
I want to see her! Just...
Just let me speak to her, please.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.880
Please.

30:15.240 --> 30:20.680
Lily, listen to me.
Please. I just wanna say goodbye.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.880
Just one hug. Please.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.200
Let me through.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.160
Go home, Mum.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.440
One hug, that's all I want.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.600
Go home, Mum.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.840
No, you're coming with me.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.000
Mum.
I'm taking her with me!

31:04.040 --> 31:05.280
Evie.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.560
Let go!

31:11.400 --> 31:13.600
Oh!

31:26.600 --> 31:28.960
We had no choice.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.720
I know.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.840
I'm on your side.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.080
Evie,

31:44.120 --> 31:46.840
you're better than us.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.560
You don't hurt each other.
You're not...

31:50.600 --> 31:53.520
You're not angry or jealous.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.120
I thought that
we could learn that from you.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.240
But we'll never change.
We're a flawed creature...

32:01.360 --> 32:04.120
..and our time
on this earth is over.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.160
So, whatever you're planning,

32:07.200 --> 32:09.200
let me help you.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.840
Please.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.600
Please, Evie.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.640
Trust me.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.080
Let me be your guide.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.520
Take me with you.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.440
What's happening?
We're taking you below ground.

34:22.480 --> 34:25.560
Why? You'll be safe there.
Safe from what?

34:52.440 --> 34:54.200
What's going on?

34:56.160 --> 34:58.160
Blackout on the town.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.760
Nathan, you have to warn your dad.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.920
Yeah.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.640
You and Mum need
to get underground now.

37:00.680 --> 37:04.280
Why underground? The blackout.
It's the only place you're safe.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
Nathan.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.320
Paul? Get underground.
What's going on?

38:15.360 --> 38:19.000
Get underground.
Paul?

38:19.920 --> 38:22.560
Paul?

38:23.600 --> 38:25.600
We need to go.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.440
Where? Where?
It's just through there.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.880
What are they doing?

39:39.320 --> 39:41.320
It's a second blackout...

39:42.320 --> 39:44.240
..to make everyone
forget they were here.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.920
If you kill people,
you attract attention.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.240
But if Midwich forgets,

39:51.280 --> 39:53.840
then no-one will know
the children exist.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.120
How do you know that?

40:03.160 --> 40:07.400
Because Evie let it slip.
She said...

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
..no-one will miss them.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.400
Don't, Cass.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.560
Don't, Cassie.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.480
Some part of Evie
did love you, you know.

40:41.840 --> 40:45.200
But the hive will
do anything to survive.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.080
I've been such a fool.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.760
No.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.400
No, Cassie.

41:04.440 --> 41:08.200
There's nothing foolish
about loving your daughter.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.360
What are we gonna do now?

41:39.200 --> 41:41.760
You have to escape.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.040
What about you?

41:45.040 --> 41:49.240
I'm gonna stay here, just for
a little while, so they don't panic.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.720
But I know what I'm doing.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.240
So just trust me, OK?

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
OK. Let's go.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.640
They've taken
all of Hannah's photos.

43:26.320 --> 43:29.880
They've taken all her stuff.
It's like she was never here.

43:31.320 --> 43:33.320
That's what the blackout's for.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.320
They want us
to forget she ever existed.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.760
Where are they going?

44:51.480 --> 44:53.480
Hi.

44:54.120 --> 44:57.480
Hi. Are you OK?

44:58.480 --> 45:00.200
Don't you know me?

45:00.240 --> 45:03.560
Er, no, I don't...
I don't think so. Should I?

45:03.600 --> 45:06.040
I haven't been here very long so...

45:09.240 --> 45:11.240
Sorry. I just...

45:13.120 --> 45:15.680
I just thought I lived here once.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.520
Are you all right?
Do you need me to call anyone?

45:20.640 --> 45:24.400
No. I'm fine.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.520
Hello.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.280
Hi, Dad.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.200
Excuse me?

46:30.200 --> 46:31.640
It's me.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.680
Zoe?

46:35.320 --> 46:37.880
Zoe, do you know this girl?

46:37.920 --> 46:39.920
Hi, Mum.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.600
I'm not your mum, darling.
You must be confused.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.600
Don't you recognise me?

46:46.640 --> 46:50.440
No, I don't. Should I?

47:03.360 --> 47:05.360
My mistake.

47:14.680 --> 47:16.000
Hi, Hannah.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.240
Hannah.
I know, I know.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.480
Ugh! Ugh!

47:42.720 --> 47:44.200
Uugghh!

48:08.920 --> 48:10.920
Main truck, please.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.480
The children
will travel in the coach.

48:16.520 --> 48:18.680
You and I will
travel in the lead vehicle.

48:19.640 --> 48:23.320
Seymour. Looking forward to having
you on the team, Miss Cummings.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.840
Miss Cummings.

49:14.560 --> 49:16.560
Let's go.

49:27.360 --> 49:29.840
Mummy.

49:29.880 --> 49:32.120
What have you done?

49:38.680 --> 49:40.480
Don't, Hannah.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.400
Hannah.
Hannah, please. Please.

50:18.120 --> 50:20.280
Get ready. We're leaving soon.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.160
My mum...

50:34.600 --> 50:36.600
..she didn't know me.

50:39.640 --> 50:42.720
And your dad?
He did.

50:48.760 --> 50:52.480
Listen, Nathan. You have to get
out of here. Take Cassie with you.

50:52.520 --> 50:55.120
Please, you have to leave.

50:55.160 --> 50:58.640
You have to get away and get safe.
Please.

50:58.680 --> 51:01.040
OK? This is your chance.

51:01.080 --> 51:03.080
Please.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.360
I'll see you on the other side.

51:29.640 --> 51:32.080
Go, go.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.560
Nathan is missing.

52:12.600 --> 52:14.640
Nathan is missing.
Nathan is missing.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.520
Nathan is missing.
Nathan is missing.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.480
Quick.

53:02.400 --> 53:05.640
This way. Come on. Comr on. Come on.

53:28.760 --> 53:30.760
Aarrgghh!

53:48.280 --> 53:50.400
No, no, no.
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

53:55.680 --> 53:58.920
We've lost him. We've lost him.
We've lost him. We've lost him.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.840
We've lost him.
We've lost him.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.760
Well then... Well then, cut him off.

54:05.760 --> 54:08.200
You don't need him. Please.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.760
Evie, let him go.

54:12.200 --> 54:14.200
Look, you took a risk coming here.

54:14.240 --> 54:17.640
A risk that they would
become attached. One boy has.

54:19.720 --> 54:24.080
Please! Please let them go.
And the girl?

54:27.880 --> 54:29.880
Cassie won't say anything.

54:29.920 --> 54:32.960
You only need one hostage,
let it be me.

54:48.400 --> 54:52.280
It's OK.
Nathan, you're gonna be all right.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.320
It's all right.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.960
Nathan. Nathan!

55:29.720 --> 55:31.720
OK. You're fine.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.760
I don't feel fine.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.920
It's done.

56:06.240 --> 56:08.240
Let's go.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.280
Clear of the town.
Keep the speed steady.

58:33.480 --> 58:37.920
I'm glad you're with us, Granny.
I would have missed you.

58:39.160 --> 58:41.160
I would have missed you too.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.760
We have a soldier down.
Uniform missing.

58:58.800 --> 59:01.520
Sir, it's possible you have
an infiltrator with you.

59:06.440 --> 59:09.120
This is Westcott.
Stop the bus. Stop The bus!

59:09.160 --> 59:10.640
Stop the car.

59:48.280 --> 59:51.880
It's OK.
Sir, he is in the rear jeep.

59:53.400 --> 59:55.120
It's all gonna be OK.

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:09.440
Mum?

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:36.680
Let's go.

1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:03.640
