My name is S. Lance Ingram.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.697
They used to call me "L."

00:31.698 --> 00:34.800
Or Crazy L from 118th.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.668
Check these streets.

00:36.669 --> 00:39.471
Check with your
crew in the joint.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.541
Find out who I am.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.452
Man: Wait for it.

01:35.862 --> 01:40.299
What about Pentium servers? A lot of our
calls are for upsizing Cisco crossovers.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.667
Yeah.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.803
You know, walk me through
it once, I'm good.

01:46.339 --> 01:49.109
Okay, great, thanks.
We'll get back to you.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.615
You have to fill out the

01:56.616 --> 01:58.584
Once we check your background
and your references,

01:58.585 --> 02:00.619
then we'll call you
for an interview.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.154
- No jobs, no jobs.
- I'll work the first week for free.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.789
- Go away.
- No harm, no foul.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.950
- Check it, I'm good.
- Hey, hey. Don't touch anything.

02:05.974 --> 02:07.326
Come on, man. Give me a chance.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.327
- Yes, police.
- All right. All right, I'm leaving.

02:10.763 --> 02:13.365
Enjoy the rest of your day.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

02:13.366 --> 02:14.900
How are you doing, sir?

02:14.901 --> 02:17.136
Little change, dollar, smile,

02:17.137 --> 02:19.671
a thumbs up, high-five.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.441
Anything.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.210
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Have a great day.

02:25.211 --> 02:26.746
You've been a
wonderful audience.

02:37.078 --> 02:39.558
Man: When I call your name, I
don't care where you are in line,

02:39.559 --> 02:41.426
just step forward.

02:41.427 --> 02:42.895
John Hand.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.264
Man ♪2: All that DNA bullshit.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.026
I liked it better in the old days
when they gave you a cup to piss in.

02:48.050 --> 02:49.468
Keep it down, folks.

02:49.469 --> 02:53.539
Gulp down a half a
bottle of vinegar,

02:53.540 --> 02:57.242
your shit will still
come out clean.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.877
Man: Ingram.

02:58.878 --> 03:01.180
Print it and sign it.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.515
- Find a job?
- Not yet.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.716
- It's been four weeks.
- I've been out there every day.

03:05.740 --> 03:08.743
By rights, I should put you on a
van back to Green Haven tomorrow.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.464
Go there. 9:00 a.m.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.567
Supervisor's name
is Yolanda Reyson.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.435
A food pantry?

03:23.436 --> 03:25.596
Come on, Mr. Morris, they had
me working in a mess hall

03:25.620 --> 03:27.272
in the joint for eight years.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.913
- Then you should be good to go.
- I got two computer certificates.

03:29.937 --> 03:33.708
I took piano lessons. You don't
see my ass up in Carnegie Hall.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.417
Be there 8:45,

03:38.418 --> 03:40.787
or I'll cuff you
on the prison van.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.276
Fellas, curfew's at 9:00 p.m.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.945
At 9:05, I lock the door
and you're violated.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.681
Have a good one.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.645
Go, go, go, go. All right, go ahead.
Go, go, go.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.086
All right, these pies, they should
be sliced and put in trays.

04:42.110 --> 04:43.282
Come on. Let's go.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.651
We should've been prepping
for dinner already.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.654
What's going on over here, huh?
Excuse me.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.590
Half the clients are gonna starve
before you make this delivery.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.925
Cohen, you better wake up.
You back on drugs?

04:53.926 --> 04:56.461
Just what the clinic
gives me for my nerves.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.997
Mm-hmm. Santiago's
out with the flu.

04:58.998 --> 05:02.568
- And you are high on tranquilizers.
- I'm fine.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.905
All right, you know what?
Follow me.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.674
Move it.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.942
Okay, you're gonna take the
keys to van number two

05:10.943 --> 05:13.779
and you are gonna
handle this route.

05:13.780 --> 05:17.416
- I needs to be out by two. Let's go.
- I can't drive.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.885
Oh, my goodness. Wow,
another useless body.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.987
Okay, do you know how
to run a straight line?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.655
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.957
Then run your butt to the
subway and make the deliveries.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.659
Make the deliveries.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.515
Woman: I know we didn't discuss
Harlem as a possible local,

05:50.516 --> 05:52.017
but this is such an
up-and-coming...

05:52.018 --> 05:54.786
- It's the hottest new area.
- No, no, no.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.088
- I've heard that.
- And I love this building.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.989
- Woman ♪2: Wow.
- Woman: Beautiful views

05:57.990 --> 05:59.830
- of both Harlem and Central Park.
- Man: Nice.

05:59.854 --> 06:02.461
There's a rooftop garden
and a garden in the back.

06:02.462 --> 06:03.895
- Man: Yeah?
- 1.2 million.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.598
- Lovely.
- All right. That's great, Faye.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.401
- This is so nice for Harlem.
- Faye?

06:09.402 --> 06:11.882
Faye: Everything else around here
has been going for much more,

06:11.906 --> 06:14.179
so you're gonna save
yourself a lot of money.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.682
- I think they play tonight.
- Yo, I got five on it.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.151
Nah, nigga, I'm talking 30.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.112
- If you wanna put money up.
- All right, 30, bet.

07:01.136 --> 07:02.120
- You got 30 on it?
- 30.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.523
- Bet on Gunners, nigga.
- All right.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.484
I wanna see the look on your face when
them niggas lose in the first round.

07:07.508 --> 07:09.494
- Hey, yo, you got that hook?
- Yeah.

07:09.495 --> 07:13.433
- Give it to Ty.
- All right.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.568
Come here, son.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.905
Come here, Ty.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.475
That's you over there.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.777
I'll talk about it later.
Hold up, hold up.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.613
Grab that nigga's iPhone, too.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.582
You heard?

07:30.583 --> 07:31.751
Go do that.

07:33.586 --> 07:37.122
- Man, fuck that!
- Yo. What up?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.090
What the fuck you
mean, "what's up"?

07:39.091 --> 07:41.660
Where the fuck you going, nigga?

07:41.661 --> 07:43.161
Tag this motherfucker.
Hit him again!

07:43.162 --> 07:44.696
- Let him know what's up!
- Ah!

07:44.697 --> 07:46.599
Get him on everything!

07:48.901 --> 07:51.604
- Come on, nigga.
- Yeah, Gunner shit, bitch.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.208
Let me see some I.D.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.110
- You're blind.
- Are you deaf?

08:03.549 --> 08:05.484
- It got a picture?
- Yes.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.853
- Whose?
- Mine.

08:07.854 --> 08:11.524
Okay, then. This is Harlem,
you can't be too safe.

08:18.130 --> 08:21.199
22. 23.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.034
Yo, that was 25, son.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.870
Where you learn how
to count, my nigga?

08:24.871 --> 08:27.111
Man, I learned how to count
the same place as you, nigga.

08:27.135 --> 08:29.007
That's not... I'll
show you what I got.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.911
Yeah, I can get up there, nigga.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.514
A'ight, one, two.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.235
- All the way up, all the way down.
- Three.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.094
What's up?

08:50.229 --> 08:51.696
Yo, you up there, Rodney.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.798
Where the money at?
Where the money?

09:02.909 --> 09:07.280
Excuse me.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.251
Move your ass out the way.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.024
Hello?

09:21.961 --> 09:23.029
Hello?

09:30.803 --> 09:32.804
Food delivery.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.341
Bread from the Heart.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.109
Ty?

10:12.912 --> 10:15.714
Get your crackhead
ass out of my house!

10:15.715 --> 10:17.182
Police!

10:17.183 --> 10:19.117
Don't make me get my gun.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.318
I'm delivering your dinner, ma'am.
Bread from the Heart.

10:21.342 --> 10:24.122
Well, you don't knock? You just
walk up in people's houses?

10:24.123 --> 10:25.443
- I don't know you.
- I did knock.

10:25.467 --> 10:27.092
The door... The
door was wide open.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.861
I keep telling that boy
to close that door.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.364
- Where's Santiago?
- Santiago out sick.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.733
I just... I just need you to
sign the delivery paper, ma'am.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.202
Just get...

10:41.073 --> 10:43.742
They put cabbage on this plate?

10:43.743 --> 10:45.276
That was the menu.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.779
Y'all know I'm
allergic to cabbage.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.147
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:49.148 --> 10:52.117
Bringing all this nasty
food up in my house.

10:52.118 --> 10:55.286
- You out your damn mind.
- No, you out your damn mind.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.188
- Crazy-ass woman.
- Get your ass out of here.

10:57.189 --> 11:00.125
- Crazy woman.
- You just go ahead and leave!

11:47.740 --> 11:49.474
Ingram.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.977
Been looking for you. My office.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.850
Eh, it just shutdown on me.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.252
- That's all?
- That's all.

12:01.253 --> 12:05.123
I gotta get my monthly
report out tonight.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.492
Dime.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.729
Paperclip.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.365
Circuit board is loose.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.837
This will hold for a while,
but you need to upgrade.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.906
You really know how
to fix these things.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.452
All right. Okay. I'll come in.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.190
- Hey, man, I gotta get on that...
- You out of here?

12:41.527 --> 12:44.295
Okay, Cohan, why don't you
take Santiago's route?

12:44.296 --> 12:45.830
I'll go.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.966
You need to be scrubbing
pots and utensils.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.770
I'll do that, too.

13:21.433 --> 13:24.970
What do you want?

13:26.472 --> 13:30.209
No salt. No cabbage. I
made the plate myself.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.256
Come on in.

13:53.299 --> 13:56.068
- Thank you.
- So, what you go to jail for?

13:58.571 --> 14:02.207
The only people that deliver around
here are junkies or convicts,

14:02.208 --> 14:05.944
and you got too many
muscles to be on drugs.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.378
Got locked up for being stupid.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.380
How much time they
give you for that?

14:09.381 --> 14:11.349
12 years.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.152
Did eight.

14:17.323 --> 14:20.124
- Those are my grandson's drawings.
- They pretty good.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.460
They gave him an art
prize at his school.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.963
Oh, and that's on my
granddaddy's farm,

14:24.964 --> 14:26.497
down in South Carolina.

14:26.498 --> 14:28.968
Oh, wait. Let me show you this.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.237
The Showman's Lounge.

14:32.238 --> 14:35.506
I was a barmaid Thursday
through Sunday for 30 years.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.443
You looked good.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.946
- What, I look bad now?
- No. It's just...

14:41.947 --> 14:43.948
No, no, no. You done
put your foot in it.

14:43.949 --> 14:45.984
No, I mean the afro
and everything.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.518
It's too late.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.562
Now, that's my husband. Al.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.465
I lost him five years
ago to cancer.

15:00.466 --> 15:04.002
And my son Alex.
Lost him to Iraq.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.271
Sorry.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.044
Come sit. Finish your lemonade.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.347
This show is funny.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.951
Girl, what's you grow
these with, crack?

15:26.558 --> 15:28.627
Ty.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.664
Excuse me.

15:35.301 --> 15:38.436
Boy, what I tell you about
drinking out of that container?

15:38.437 --> 15:42.107
- Ain't but a little bit left.
- But it don't matter.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.576
This is my grandson Ty.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.146
Lance.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.651
- That's your food.
- He's hungry.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.492
- I'll be all right.
- Let him make a sandwich.

15:55.516 --> 15:57.485
Excuse me?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.493
You got bologna,
bread, mayonnaise.

16:02.494 --> 16:05.530
You better get out of my darn refrigerator
and mind your own damn business.

16:05.531 --> 16:06.731
This food is for the
people we deliver to.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.333
Yes, and after you
give it to me,

16:08.334 --> 16:10.234
I can flush it down the
toilet if I want to.

16:10.235 --> 16:13.037
- Don't be disrespecting my grandmother.
- Ty, you sit down.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.706
Ty.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.444
- What?
- Sit down, Ty, like I told you and eat.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.461
Man: I fuck Iraqi bitches.

16:36.462 --> 16:39.564
I fuck Spanish bitches.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.235
Do you have a light? I...

16:44.236 --> 16:46.796
- I said there's no smoking.
- You got a light? Shut the fuck up!

16:46.797 --> 16:48.877
- You don't talk to me like that.
- Shut the fuck up!

16:48.901 --> 16:50.745
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!

16:51.577 --> 16:54.512
I fuck white bitches.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.116
I hate black bitches.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.230
Hey, man. Who won the game?

17:13.132 --> 17:16.067
I said, who won the game?

18:01.346 --> 18:02.414
Yo, L.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.724
How long you been
out the joint, huh?

18:13.725 --> 18:15.661
A few weeks.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.397
Why you acting all
shady and shit?

18:19.398 --> 18:21.499
- Shady?
- Shady, nigga. I ain't stutter.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.267
You seen me coming out the

18:25.537 --> 18:27.457
- What up with that?
- You said your barber shop?

18:27.481 --> 18:30.174
Yeah, man. I'm trying to make
an honest dollar, all right?

18:30.175 --> 18:31.975
11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

18:31.999 --> 18:35.213
Damn. Maybe Moses
did part the sea.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.482
You thought I was still

18:37.483 --> 18:38.803
Gonna as you to do

18:38.827 --> 18:42.220
Nah, a lot of dumb shit.

18:42.221 --> 18:43.754
What you need, man?
You need anything?

18:43.755 --> 18:45.423
- I'm good.
- Don't lie to me.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.858
I'm good.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.526
Shit, nigga, you need a gym.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.829
I ain't trying to get soft.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.902
I'm Jomo the Soft now, huh?

18:58.770 --> 19:00.639
Soft like this?

19:02.374 --> 19:05.444
Huh? Soft like that?

19:07.379 --> 19:09.181
Let's see what you got.

19:12.584 --> 19:15.553
Oh, no. Oh, you got

Nigga, wait till you get some pussy

19:22.903 --> 19:25.336
Not me, brother. If it ain't
rough, it ain't right.

19:31.737 --> 19:32.804
Oh!

19:48.587 --> 19:50.821

Payday. Anita.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.570
Harris. Don't call in sick.
I know your game.

20:05.571 --> 20:09.407
Gomez. Rodriguez.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.910
My favorite, Cohen.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.548
Yours has a pink slip.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.553
Why you messing with my head?

20:22.554 --> 20:24.923
Now I have to take
my stress pills.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.860
By yourself some white T-shirts.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.797
That one's dingy.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.654
- Cock it back?
- Nah, nah, don't cock it back.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.989
- Yo. This your phone?
- Yeah, this is my phone.

21:33.925 --> 21:37.461
- Where's your I.D.? I.D. I.D.
- He's my little bro.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.530
- There's no reason to arrest him.
- Turn that off.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.632
- They just came out of...
- No need for that, sir.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.302
- I live right here.
- They didn't do nothing, man.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.304
Come on, you're squeezing
his wrists, bro.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.025
- I came from school just now.
- Shh. Quiet.

21:48.026 --> 21:50.127
Turn that thing off. Turn
that thing off right now.

21:50.128 --> 21:52.977
From school and I live right here.
My grandmother lives upstairs.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.645
My grandmother lives upstairs.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.048
- They in high school, man.
- Quiet down.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.949
We live right here.
This is our block.

21:58.950 --> 22:01.653
- This is our block, man.
- Excuse me, my man.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.601
Keyboard, printer, $1,000.

22:17.602 --> 22:19.770
Oh, that's a lot.

22:19.771 --> 22:22.973
Okay, you're nice lady,
so I do every for $900.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.642
This is a refurbished desktop.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.677
It only got 512
megabytes of RAM.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.358
- You get out of my store right now.
- You're trying to rip her off.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.048
Yes, police.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.417
- A man is bothering my customer.
- I know this lady.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.898
- You don't know this lady.
- I'm telling you I know this lady.

22:35.899 --> 22:37.579
- You don't know this lady.
- Yes, he does.

22:37.603 --> 22:39.023
He's my nephew.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.526
And you tell the cops to come down
here and lock up your cheating ass.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.063
Come on. Let's go.

22:54.005 --> 22:57.075
You can put everything
right here.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.844
There you go.

22:59.845 --> 23:03.948
So, you gonna make a
computer in my living room?

23:03.949 --> 23:06.484
- Yep.
- My husband Al,

23:06.485 --> 23:08.018
he tried to make a TV once.

23:08.019 --> 23:09.787
- Did it work?
- No.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.155
Well, this is gonna work.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.691
And you gonna get it for
just 350 and parts.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.460
All right.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.943
It look complicated.

23:36.982 --> 23:39.083
Ooh!

23:39.084 --> 23:41.819
Oh, that's nice. Oh, yes.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.654
Thank you.

23:43.655 --> 23:46.857
So, tell me how to buy
stuff off the Internet.

23:46.858 --> 23:50.795
Let me finish setting
up your email first.

23:50.796 --> 23:53.464
Now, type in your password.

23:53.465 --> 23:55.833
- T-Y-R...
- It should be a secret.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.935
- Why?
- You don't want people looking through

23:57.936 --> 23:59.103
your personal information.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.806
What's this, your work badge?

24:01.807 --> 24:03.607
"S. Lance Ingram."

24:03.608 --> 24:05.776
Don't use my...
Don't use my name.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.546
I'm not using your name.
What's the "S" for?

24:08.547 --> 24:09.681
It's just an initial.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.717
It stands for "sir."

24:13.718 --> 24:17.054
My father wanted to
name me Sir Lancelot

24:17.055 --> 24:19.089
so I would be treated
like royalty.

24:19.090 --> 24:22.460
- My mama shortened it to Sir Lance.
- Oh.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.531
Well, that's better than
your first name being nigga.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.533
Or Junebug.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.636
You're just messing with me.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.472
- Turn around.
- Huh?

24:34.473 --> 24:37.609
Turn around so I can put
in the secret word.

- Grandma.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.744
About wearing your
drooping pants?

28:33.745 --> 28:36.814
And you, too. You
pull up them pants.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.482
What you mean, Grandma? You
don't know me like that now.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.984
Boy, if you gonna show your
butt, I'm gonna smack it.

28:40.985 --> 28:44.021
Now, both y'all, pull up your...
Pull up your pants.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.289
Get them pants up, ugly boy.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.725
- Go.
- Ty, why is you...

28:47.726 --> 28:50.327
- Who is that?
- It's just my friends, Grandma.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.730
Come on, Grandma.
Let's just go home.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.899
I don't know what to say to you no more.
I just don't know what to do with you.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.003
Y'all get your pants up.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.939
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:40.912 --> 29:44.114
Miss Maddy: Hey, Sir
Lance, how you doing?

29:44.115 --> 29:46.250
Hi, Miss Maddy.

29:46.251 --> 29:49.253
- How's the computer doing?
- Oh, the kids love it.

29:49.254 --> 29:52.289
Ty doing his homework.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.793
They got a class in video games?

29:55.794 --> 29:58.496
Come on, Sir Lance, have a seat.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.902
- Your granddaughter?
- My neighbor's granddaughter.

30:04.903 --> 30:08.138
But I've been watching her
since she was a tiny thing.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.307
I have two grandmas.

30:10.308 --> 30:14.044
- So, you gonna come see me dance?
- You can come any Sunday now.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.980
- 10:45. You can come with me.
- I ain't much for church.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.517
Yeah, that's the same thing my
husband Al said for 42 years.

30:20.518 --> 30:23.854
I wonder what he's telling
the devil right about now.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.489
You saying your
husband went to hell?

30:25.490 --> 30:28.425
I thought the prayers of your
loved ones carried you through.

30:28.426 --> 30:31.128
Who said I prayed for
his stubborn ass?

30:31.129 --> 30:32.489
Ooh, Grandma Maddy,
you said "ass."

30:32.513 --> 30:34.531
Ass is in the Bible.
Now, turn around.

30:34.532 --> 30:38.468
Now, go on in the back room, watch
TV while I have my computer class.

30:38.469 --> 30:41.205
Go ahead. Take that pillow.

30:41.206 --> 30:43.473
Good girl.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.545
- Where you going?
- Out.

30:48.546 --> 30:51.048
You be back in this
house by 8:00.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.418
You know this is a school night.

30:57.121 --> 30:59.323
He's a good kid. He just...

30:59.324 --> 31:02.427
needs to be straightened
out every now and then.

31:03.962 --> 31:06.530
Get you a chair out the kitchen.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.738
- You remember how
to look things

31:08.750 --> 31:10.968
- up on the Internet?
- Yeah.

31:10.969 --> 31:14.504
What I wanna know is how to buy
things off of this computer.

31:14.505 --> 31:18.609
Well, you gonna need a
credit card or a bank card.

31:18.610 --> 31:22.946
And for some of the sites, you're gonna
have to set up an online account.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.983
- Let me show you.
- I need you to tell me what to do

31:25.984 --> 31:28.652
and then I can practice
it on my own, okay?

31:28.653 --> 31:31.455
All right, so, now...

31:31.456 --> 31:33.457
- Go ahead.
- Cool.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.926
- You gonna take the mouse.
- "Take the mouse."

31:35.927 --> 31:37.527
Okay, the mouse.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.263
And you gonna click the browser.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.984
Click the... Now, which is the...
What is...

31:40.985 --> 31:43.305
- That white... the white strip.
- That's that white thing?

31:43.329 --> 31:44.134
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:44.135 --> 31:46.103
And then you're gonna
enter the website

31:46.104 --> 31:47.571
that you want to go to.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.539
- Then I go into the website.
- Yeah.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.174
- So...
- Well, if...

31:51.175 --> 31:54.378
Most... No. Most websites,
they start with W-W-W.

31:54.379 --> 31:56.413
Okay, "W-W-W... ".

31:56.414 --> 31:58.181
Now, is that little
tiny "W" or big "W"?

31:58.182 --> 31:59.742
Doesn't matter. It's
for World Wide Web.

31:59.766 --> 32:01.551
- Any "W." World Wide, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

32:01.552 --> 32:03.287
But I don't have to
type the whole word.

32:03.288 --> 32:05.289
I just type the... I don't
type "World Wide Web."

32:05.290 --> 32:07.591
- No, just "W-W-W."
- What happens if I type in.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.259
"World Wide Web"?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.228
It's probably gonna take
you to some other place.

Which one is me, nigga?

33:26.604 --> 33:28.684

34:17.088 --> 34:19.188
My man Jomo tells me you into
putting that work, what's up?

34:19.190 --> 34:20.657

I shouldn't be making

37:28.412 --> 37:31.781
But Santiago bails on me
for a construction job.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.483
You can't drive.

37:33.484 --> 37:37.320
- I need to get some real help.
- I can drive.

37:37.321 --> 37:40.457
Then why have you been wasting
your time in the subways?

37:40.458 --> 37:42.525
I ain't got no license.

37:42.526 --> 37:45.395
Oh-oh-oh, are you kid...

37:45.396 --> 37:49.299
I'ma... Get out.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.569
I'm not trying to
violate my parole.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.605
Don't worry about it.
It's all right.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.975
- My brother's a police sergeant.
- Figures.

38:05.416 --> 38:08.518
- Missy Maddy James?
- Okay.

38:08.519 --> 38:09.953
Excuse me.

38:09.954 --> 38:13.056
Doctor: How's your back on
a scale of 1-10 pain-wise?

38:13.057 --> 38:15.326
Um...

38:16.894 --> 38:19.729

38:21.699 --> 38:24.534
All right, let's take a listen.

38:24.535 --> 38:27.938
- Okay.
- Take a deep breath for me.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.874
And let it out slowly.

38:30.875 --> 38:33.377
Okay.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.424
We got tore up
from the floor up.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.659
We go up on the
deck of the ship,

38:49.660 --> 38:52.862
and, uh, the moonlight is
bouncing off the water.

38:52.863 --> 38:56.700
- - And the cool
breeze of the island.

38:56.701 --> 38:59.437
Man, it was something.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.872

- Oh, I'll tell you.

39:02.873 --> 39:05.608
You make me look like new money.

39:05.609 --> 39:08.545

39:08.546 --> 39:11.448

39:11.449 --> 39:13.350
Good to be seen. Here,

Computer's running faster,

39:23.594 --> 39:25.695
Love it. How 'bout my photos?

39:25.696 --> 39:27.630
You check those out?
I know you did.

39:27.631 --> 39:29.599
Don't lie to me.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.968
Oh. My man, can you flip that?

39:31.969 --> 39:34.070
You know, rotate it,
make it a screensaver.

39:34.071 --> 39:36.005
Jomo, you messing

39:36.006 --> 39:37.707
Come on, man, this is

39:39.710 --> 39:41.111
Come on, man, I'm
single, all right?

39:41.112 --> 39:43.413
I like the drink
ginseng, all right?

39:43.414 --> 39:45.915
Rule number one... if you got a
gift to share, you share it.

39:45.916 --> 39:49.486
Whether it's cutting hair or, you
know, cutting something else.

39:49.487 --> 39:51.521
Got it.

39:51.522 --> 39:55.492
Let me holler at you for a minute.
I got something for you.

39:55.493 --> 39:58.895
Take care of you, L.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.897
Come on, man, that ain't nothing.
Don't sweat that.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.578
Just keep it around the
store for security.

40:02.602 --> 40:03.833
I got shorties in here.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.770
- Here.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.972
Man, I would be paying

40:08.973 --> 40:11.641
So I'd rather pay my friend.
Come here.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.444
Uh, give me a haircut.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.180

40:17.181 --> 40:19.115
Dig that. What are

40:19.116 --> 40:20.717
What do we want?

40:20.718 --> 40:22.819
Uh, let's get a little

40:22.820 --> 40:25.088

Shit! Fuck this shit!

40:27.124 --> 40:29.793

42:22.540 --> 42:24.275
Hey! Come here!

42:42.059 --> 42:43.793

42:45.963 --> 42:47.597

You hear me?

43:20.764 --> 43:22.366
Ingram, come here.

43:31.175 --> 43:35.044
You tested positive

43:35.045 --> 43:36.913
I hear you're doing
good at your job.

43:36.914 --> 43:38.781
You make your
curfew every night.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.684
Why you getting high?

43:47.257 --> 43:51.027
I guess I'm just a
non-deserving fuck-up.

43:51.028 --> 43:53.963
Well, at least you
didn't try to play me

43:53.964 --> 43:57.001
with no dumbass
jailhouse psychology.

43:59.837 --> 44:02.038
Turn around.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.907
I'll write it up as a
category four violation.

44:04.908 --> 44:07.276
The parole board will probably
hit you with six months.

44:07.277 --> 44:08.379
Thanks.

44:21.358 --> 44:23.293
I can't do nothing

There you go.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.322

46:29.386 --> 46:31.420
So, Lance, what are you doing?

46:31.421 --> 46:34.423
- Eating chicken.
- With a knife and a fork?

46:34.424 --> 46:36.793
Yeah.

46:36.794 --> 46:40.196
I took an etiquette
class while I was away.

46:40.197 --> 46:42.331
This lady volunteered. She
came in a couple times.

46:42.332 --> 46:44.167
- A white lady?
- Yeah.

46:44.168 --> 46:46.235
Mm-hmm.

46:46.236 --> 46:48.571
And she told you you need
to eat fried chicken

46:48.572 --> 46:51.908
- with a knife and a fork?
- Well, yeah.

46:51.909 --> 46:54.577
She probably had you eating
cornbread with a spoon.

46:56.346 --> 46:59.416
- Ty: Oh, hi, Miss Reynolds.
- Oh, Darlene!

47:01.084 --> 47:06.455
- Darlene, you made it.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

47:06.456 --> 47:09.359
Second services were long today.

47:28.212 --> 47:29.446
I ain't know you worked out.

47:35.252 --> 47:36.920
Look...

47:38.288 --> 47:41.424
I'm sorry about the way I
came at you the other day.

47:41.425 --> 47:44.527
Yeah, that was real fucked up,
you know what I'm saying?

47:44.528 --> 47:47.163
Thought about getting my hammer
and put it to your head.

47:47.164 --> 47:50.467
Like I said, I'm sorry.

48:05.048 --> 48:08.217
Well, uh, I tell the people my
best friend of 20-some-odd years,

48:08.218 --> 48:10.920
he repairs computers, so they
dropped off their computers.

48:10.921 --> 48:13.322
You decide what to charge 'em.

48:13.323 --> 48:15.358
Did you ask them what
was wrong with 'em?

48:15.359 --> 48:19.195
Come on, does it look like my head
is made of wood? No, all right?

48:19.196 --> 48:22.465
They wrote down what the problem was
and they put their name next to it.

48:22.466 --> 48:24.433
There's the Bible.

48:24.434 --> 48:27.169
I don't have a workshop.

48:27.170 --> 48:29.538
Use the back storeroom.
Just clean it out.

48:29.539 --> 48:33.676
I need some more tools
and a slave computer.

48:33.677 --> 48:35.611
I ain't got no slave in here.

48:35.612 --> 48:38.214
It's a figure of speech, man.

48:38.215 --> 48:41.550
I need a good computer so I can diagnose
what is wrong with the bad ones.

48:41.551 --> 48:45.221
Oh, okay, word. Like
chicks, I get it.

48:45.222 --> 48:48.224
- All right.
- What's your split?

48:48.225 --> 48:50.945
Come on, man, all the times you
helped me out when I ain't have shit.

48:50.969 --> 48:52.261
You kidding me?

48:52.262 --> 48:55.499
$200 a month and 20%
of what I make.

48:57.567 --> 49:00.436
Okay, L.

49:00.437 --> 49:03.073
150 and 10%, you got
yourself a deal.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.575
You're an ass-backward
business man, you know that?

49:06.576 --> 49:10.413
Mm, I know that. And
you still my hero.

49:10.414 --> 49:12.349
Let's get to work.

49:21.491 --> 49:24.460
Ingram.

49:24.461 --> 49:28.165
- Yeah.
- Curfew. Time to bring it inside.

49:41.345 --> 49:44.146
Oh, my God. The damn
compressor broke.

49:44.147 --> 49:48.017
Ingram, we're gonna lose
$400 worth of food.

49:48.018 --> 49:50.720
Get the meat, put as much
as you can in the freezer,

49:50.721 --> 49:53.155
and then the rest, like the
milk, the juice and the eggs,

49:53.156 --> 49:55.292
we'll take back to my house.

49:59.363 --> 50:01.364
G-Rod: Anytime you

50:01.365 --> 50:03.165

50:03.166 --> 50:04.667

As long as you rocking with us, nigga,

50:32.891 --> 50:36.232

- Yeah.

50:36.233 --> 50:40.069
Fuck everybody else, you

50:40.070 --> 50:42.272
Come on, we're gonna
go smoke some weed.

50:46.643 --> 50:49.745
You could, uh, put the stuff

50:49.746 --> 50:52.748
in the refrigerator.

50:52.749 --> 50:54.583
There should be room.

50:54.584 --> 50:57.420
Yeah.

51:00.257 --> 51:02.258
You get your license yet?

51:02.259 --> 51:04.760
- I got a permit.
- Mm-hmm.

51:04.761 --> 51:06.796
Okay.

51:06.797 --> 51:10.466
Take the van back to the center. I'm
too tired to drive across town.

51:10.467 --> 51:13.202
- What if I get stopped?
- Mm.

51:13.203 --> 51:17.540
You tell 'em that you work
for Sergeant Elise's sister.

51:17.541 --> 51:21.544
Police don't care about
relations to the third power.

51:21.545 --> 51:23.679
Oh, gosh. Okay, so
then do an O.J.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.314
Make a run for it.

51:25.315 --> 51:27.817
It'll be exciting.
Helicopters flying over you.

51:27.818 --> 51:29.819
Following you in a food van.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.621
- You got jokes, Yolanda.
- No, I ain't got jokes.

51:32.622 --> 51:34.723
I'm too tired for jokes.
I just keep it real.

51:34.724 --> 51:36.592
I told you, get a license.

51:36.593 --> 51:38.594
A'ight.

51:38.595 --> 51:41.597
This is about all
that'll fit in here.

51:41.598 --> 51:44.300
Maybe we can give the other
juices to a homeless shelter.

51:44.301 --> 51:45.702
Whatever you want.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.406
Whoa.

51:50.407 --> 51:53.709
Please, can't a girl
get comfortable

51:53.710 --> 51:56.813

a long day at work?

51:59.382 --> 52:03.219
I mean, yeah. I mean,

52:03.220 --> 52:05.855
Come sit.

52:05.856 --> 52:08.457
You know, I'm good.

52:08.458 --> 52:10.427

52:13.663 --> 52:15.731
Come on, you worked

52:15.732 --> 52:17.200
Relax.

52:20.604 --> 52:23.606
Where did you do time?

52:23.607 --> 52:26.576
Attica. Green Haven.

52:28.178 --> 52:31.147
Your girl must be really
happy to have you back.

52:31.148 --> 52:34.450
I, um, I ain't got a girlfriend.

52:34.451 --> 52:36.385
Mm.

52:36.386 --> 52:39.289
- I'm sorry. Your boyfriend?
- Nah.

52:42.792 --> 52:44.193
Mm.

52:44.194 --> 52:46.829
I'm sure that you
must have, um...

52:46.830 --> 52:50.934
a whole lot of love
inside of you.

52:54.504 --> 52:57.773
You know, I don't
know if this is cool.

52:57.774 --> 53:00.509
You know, with you being
my supervisor and all.

53:00.510 --> 53:02.345
Oh...

53:04.948 --> 53:07.583
I wonder how cool it is

53:07.584 --> 53:09.952
if I, um...

53:09.953 --> 53:12.254
called your parole officer

53:12.255 --> 53:16.225
and I told him of all the
food that's been missing

53:16.226 --> 53:19.396
and all those hours
that you go AWOL.

53:20.330 --> 53:22.932
Where do you go?

53:22.933 --> 53:25.734
Are you gambling?

53:25.735 --> 53:28.804
Oh...

53:28.805 --> 53:31.440
Are you selling drugs?

53:31.441 --> 53:35.211
You're cold, Yolanda.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.845
I'm not cold.

53:36.846 --> 53:39.448
Just real.

53:39.449 --> 53:41.651

56:21.578 --> 56:24.513
I used to give

56:24.514 --> 56:27.783
Make recruits prove
they was loyal.

56:27.784 --> 56:29.785
They was family.

56:29.786 --> 56:33.523
But real family don't make you jeopardize
your future, you know what I mean?

56:56.513 --> 56:58.480
We need to double
scrub the facility.

56:58.481 --> 57:00.949
I just got heads up that
we're up for an inspection.

57:00.950 --> 57:04.052

appointments all this week.

second of the scrub down,

I'm gonna have to kick the air

57:11.161 --> 57:14.663

What are you doing sitting up here in

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:15.143
Why what?

Do I look like something
wrong with me to you?

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:22.985
I was installing the
antivirus on your computer

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:24.786
when a messaged popped
up from the clinic

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:26.267
saying it's important
for you to call.

01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:30.258
Who you know my age ain't
going to some clinic?

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:33.228
The doctor say you got terminal
cancer and you refusing treatment.

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:35.064
My doctor?

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:39.835
Why is my doctor telling
you my business?

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.104
You know what? I'm calling
Legal Aid on her.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.805
They gone take her damn license.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:46.008
Malpractice! Medical
malpractice!

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:48.177
- That's what it is.
- I told them I'm your son.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.948

My husband Al, he
died from cancer.

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:08.163
All that chemo, all that
radiation they gave him

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:12.701
made him just waste away
like he was a skeleton.

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:16.438
He died in my arms
right in the bedroom.

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:18.774
But they not doing that to me.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:22.210
The doctors say without... without
treatment, you only got a few months.

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:24.891
Well, them damn doctors don't know
what the hell they talking about.

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.248
They don't know shit!

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:29.184
I got my saba juice. I
got my garlic compound.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.787
I got my cayenne paste. Got

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.889
That shit don't work.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:37.225
You might as well get some dog shit
from Central Park and make a tea.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:40.328
Well, if that don't work...

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:42.765
I got something else that will.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.437
Come on.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.473
This is it.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.078
This...

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.313
What is all this?

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:02.050
This is so I can leave
here as Maddy James.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:05.353
Not some bald and
sickly-smelling

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.756
little ragdoll with a shit bag

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:09.925
tied to her stomach.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:13.829
- You talking about killing yourself?
- You're damn right.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.932
Instead of those stupid
shitty doctors doing it.

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.834
You damn right!

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.335
- God damn it!
- Miss Maddy, stop it.

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:22.237
- God damn it!
- Stop... stop!

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.239
- God damn it!
- Stop.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.274
God damn it.

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:33.950
I'm sorry.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.326
Oh, God.

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:47.796
You know, instead of
you plucking my nerve,

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:50.365
you ought to be helping me.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:51.933
Mm-mm.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:54.102
I mean, all you got to do

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:57.405
is connect the IV, put the button
in my hand, and then leave.

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.841
That's crazy.

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.777
- Not for a million dollars.
- I want you to read these instructions.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.445
This is wrong. I'm
not reading that.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.814
You know you like
building things.

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:07.884
- I'm not doing it!
- Okay!

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:12.954
- Fine.
- Miss Maddy...

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.090
Fine.

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:18.553
I thought you were gonna
come by this week.

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:22.390
Uh... I've been busy
working my second job.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:26.094
Well, you need to handle your business
so that you can keep your first job.

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:28.096
You ever heard of
sexual harassment?

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:32.134
Is that what they call it when
you're jerking off on yourself?

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:38.974
This ain't from the food pantry.
This from Bertha's.

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:41.109
Then you eat it.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.912
You mad at me?

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.149
I wouldn't starve myself
for no rudy-poody man.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.517
Not even you.

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:52.520
I just don't have an appetite.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:55.423
- You're losing weight.
- Thank you.

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.125
Miss Maddy.

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:59.995
Go to the corner store
and get me some, uh,

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.663
strawberry ice cream.

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:04.933
Not that cheap kind either.
Get some expensive ice cream.

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.168
I'll get you some ice cream
if you eat a few bites.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:10.906
- What do I look like to you, a kid?
- No.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.076
If you're gonna bribe a woman, you
gonna have to do it with diamonds.

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:17.512
I'ma get you some
ice cream, then.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.283
Come on, eat a few bites.
It ain't gonna hurt you.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.351
Mm-mm.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:50.412
- That from a comic book?
- Nah, this from me.

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:53.515
Name is Blaze. He's
a pyrokinetic.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:57.485
Come with me to the store.
Let's get some snacks.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:59.988
Nah.

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.991
It's a'ight.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.981
Can I speak to you?

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:33.088
What?

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.223
In private.

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:38.126
Look, man, we all
one voice here.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.527
One nation, you feel me?

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:43.732
So, whatever you got to
say, you can say it.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:46.368
My name is Sir Lance Ingram.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.038
Sir lance Ingram.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.641
But everybody knows me as "L."

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:57.078
Or Crazy L from 118th Street.

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:59.481
I want you to check with
your five-star generals.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.783
Have them check with their
older heads in the joint.

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.785
Find out who I am.

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:06.187
Whatever, bro.

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.423
Nigga, I know who you are.
You Spider-Man.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:11.127
Nigga got on a red shirt, too.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:37.318
My friend just got arrested.
He got beat, I got beat.

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:40.455
I got a scar still from police.
My hand was split in half.

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:43.425
Got knees busted up
from police, NYPD.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:46.694
Jomo: The more things change,
the more shit stay the same.

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:49.498
- Harlem, U.S.A., L.
- Yeah.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.835
These kids out here caught
in the middle of it all.

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:56.438
No, these shorties
are different, L.

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.640
Even if we did something
we weren't supposed to do,

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:02.410
we still did it in a way, you
know, there was etiquette, man.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.345
These shorties got no
rules or regulations.

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.614
Just raw. Just...

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.817
All emotion, man.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:13.455
- Thick out here, bro.
- Yeah, it's thick, you know?

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:17.459
Mike Browns and
Trevons everywhere.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.162
Shorties running from cops same
way you was at 12 years of age.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.667
We was both out there, bro.

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:28.203
Yeah, I figured I
learned how to run

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:31.106
running from cops, too.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.809
Look at where you are now, man.
Look at this.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:40.281
18957th Ave.

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:41.816
I always wanted to have a shop,

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.777
you know, around the corner
from where we grew up.

01:08:43.801 --> 01:08:46.871
- That was my dream.
- Got your sweet ride.

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:51.260
And you back, six months out.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.662
Feels good that you
back on the block, man.

01:08:55.663 --> 01:08:57.166
It does.

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:01.236
What you need, man?
I know that look.

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:02.571
What you need?

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.277
You think you could
get me a little weed?

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:12.779
A little what? What you say?

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:15.850
I don't know if I heard
you, uh, correctly.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.618
Can you come again?
A little what?

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.321
You did say Wii, the game, right?
That little...

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.189
- Yeah, the...
- Yeah? Wii?

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.591
- Nigga, I said...
- What you want?

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:26.426
Do you think you could
get me a little weed?

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.263
Weed?

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:30.319
- Sir Lancelot is trying to

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.399
get light a lot. -

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:35.470
Don't be telling nobody that shit
about that Sir Lancelot, man.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.205
I won't, bro.

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.874
And I got you on the weed.

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:42.676
I can get you a woman, too. I'm
good in the "W" department.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.578
Wireless, women, weed,
what you need, huh?

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.613
- I don't want your leftovers.
- Oh, true.

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:48.515
- I got one for you, though.
- What?

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.586
- Oh, yeah.
- Fair exchange. Done deal, brother.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.924
When you puff,
hold it for a sec.

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.760
Boy...

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:01.262
I've been smoking reefer

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:04.566
before you was even an itch
in your father's pants.

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:10.305
Sorry.

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.873
Okay.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:15.644
I'ma go in the other room so
I don't fail my drug test.

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:24.320
Thank you.

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:27.823
Go on.

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:54.950
- You all right?
- Hey.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.622
I'm fine.

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:04.325
- How's your pain?
- Pain is fine.

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:06.527
Thank you.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:09.397
Ooh, I'm hungry as hell, though.

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.432
Oh.

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.635
- Oh.
- What you looking for?

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:16.337
What is there in here to eat?
Good night.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:21.943
Where's that old
mantry-pantry food?

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.911
I'll get it for you.
Have a seat.

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:26.347
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll get it for you.

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:28.716
Miss Maddy, don't fall
in the refrigerator.

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:30.677
- I'll get it for you. Sit down.
- What's up here?

01:11:30.701 --> 01:11:32.587
Some ice cream?

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:34.889
- Ooh, it's cool.
- Go have a seat.

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:37.292
Yeah, it's cool in
that refrigerator.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:38.394
Okay.

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:43.666
You are a good man, Sir Lance.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:47.468
You're a good woman, Miss Maddy.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:48.936
Why people do that?

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.005
Standing there all night

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:53.642
bullcrapping each other
with compliments.

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:58.646
I'm trying to tell you

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:01.749
I see the good in you.

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.421
- You better listen.
- I'm listening.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.023
Why are you so sad?

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:11.726
Hmm?

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:14.596
Why are you so sad?

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.364
Hmm?

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:19.567
It was either your...

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:21.969
daddy or some woman

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:25.641
just rip your heart
right out your chest.

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:30.479
And I'm thinking that
it was some woman.

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:36.984
- Mm-hmm.
- There was, um...

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:40.822
this girl I really liked
when I first went to prison.

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.457
Yeah.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.893
Only girl I've
ever really liked.

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:50.631
First two years, she came and
visited me every Sunday.

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:53.000
- Then she just stopped coming.
- Mm.

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.669
Stop answering my letters.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.072
Come to find out she had
a baby by another dude.

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:02.111
Well, since you've been out...

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:07.448
- you seen her?
- I seen her. She ain't seen me.

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.484
Mm-hmm.

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:12.487
You... you gonna
have to go get her,

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.489
or you're gonna
have to let her go.

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:17.892
Let her go, or go get her.

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:22.398
'Cause you cannot live
your life in the middle.

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:25.467
Mm-mm.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.117

Hey, yo! Yo, L.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.503
Yo, let me holler at
you real quick, G.

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:46.781
Man, so I heard you was the
truth when you was out here.

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:49.784
He said you used to show niggas
how to keep the shit real.

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.118
Chapter and verse.

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:53.688
You remind me of myself
when I was young.

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:57.191
So I know nobody can't
tell you nothing.

01:14:57.192 --> 01:15:00.628
Ty, he don't need
to be a Gunner.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:02.798
Got enough soldiers.

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.038
It's a grand.

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:15.644
Giving respect, from one
general to another.

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:18.280
Yo.

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:23.551
Let this one go.

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:24.653
Yeah, all right.

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.227
Let's roll.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.910
Yo, G, it's like the
circus and shit, my nigga.

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:50.579
Yeah, that's what's up.

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:59.620
The workout crews are gonna do
pullups on every street corner

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.923
from 110th Street to 155th.

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:05.293
Y'all with me? Y'all with me?

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:06.928
But what we get out
of this, though?

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:10.298
What do you get? Pride.
That we did something.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:12.739
And we showed all these kids out
here that we about something.

01:16:12.763 --> 01:16:15.336
They killing brothers left and
right, from Harlem to Brooklyn,

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.638
from Florida or St.
Louis, Missouri.

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.206
They even got little
kids in handcuffs.

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.676
Little Scott, five years
old in handcuffs.

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:23.711
It's done, so it
starts right now.

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.646
We organizing against
this to stop this.

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:28.015
So, on the count of
three, we all one hood.

01:16:28.016 --> 01:16:32.053
- One, two, three.

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:33.988

- We all one hood!

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:36.758
Let's go! Come on!

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.831
Yo, so, you're not coming?

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:46.101
Nah, shorty. Do you.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.661
Sir Lance...

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.771
What is all this?

01:17:56.772 --> 01:18:01.242
Just let me get my
thoughts straight.

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.412
I'ma tell you.

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:09.450
All this is everything
I made bartending.

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.786
All my tips.

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:13.287
This one is for Shay-Shay.

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:15.156
It's $15,000.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:18.926
By the time she goes to
college, it oughta be 20.

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:21.996
This one is for my Ty.

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:26.400
Now, it's 30,000.

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:31.472
But he still needs to
try for scholarships.

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:34.208
This $10,000 is for you.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.478
- Miss Maddy, I don't need no money.
- Son, just...

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:42.216
$17,000 cash.

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:47.088
That's to take care of Ty until
he's ready to go to college.

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:49.356
You can move in here
if you want to.

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:52.059
- He, um, he don't mind.
- Miss Maddy.

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.497
'Cause, ooh, he
really likes you.

01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:01.436
- Why me?
- Because you're here.

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:07.776
Thank God you here.

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:30.264
Jomo: They chase L to the
roof of the building, right?

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:32.199
- Mm-hmm.
- He's running.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.169
I'm telling you, Ty,
like sprinting full out.

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:38.105
He leaps, jumps 20 feet.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:40.407
Lands on the roof of the
other building, gets away.

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:42.009
- For real?
- Straight up.

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.378
- It was more like ten feet.
- Nah, come on.

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:46.514
- It was ten feet.
- No, man.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:50.050
And cops still came and dragged my
dumb 12-year-old ass out the bed,

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:52.651
- so I don't know what the point was.
- Man, you missed your call.

01:19:52.675 --> 01:19:54.421
- Okay, all right.
- '96 Olympics.

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.056
That should've been you.
Sir Lance.

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:57.424
- You got jokes, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.994
Okay, so let's joke
about them grades.

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:02.163
- Mm.
- Oh, tone changed, huh?

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:04.398
- And it gets quiet.
- It's the teachers, right?

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.866
- The teachers don't like me.
- Oh, here we go.

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.168
- The teach... Come on.
- Jomo.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:09.009
- Did we... we said that, right?
- Come on now.

01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:10.810
- Come on.
- The teacher really don't like me.

01:20:10.834 --> 01:20:12.473
Teacher's racist, right?

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.843
Now she racist. You're
making excuses, man.

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.812
- You said the same shit we said.
- Look, look.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.147
When I raise my hand,
and the teacher

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:22.449
will call on the lighter-skin
brother next to me.

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:24.251
Oh, Jomo, I think
he calling you out.

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:26.612
You directing that toward someone
on this side of the table?

01:20:26.636 --> 01:20:28.923
What race is this teacher?

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:31.525
- Wha... wha...
- She's of African-American descent.

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:35.462
"African-American descent." You
got real intellectual with it.

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:38.533
- Y'all playing.
- You playing.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.972
It's open.

01:20:56.518 --> 01:21:01.021
- Who's this?
- I'm like your wet dream come true, baby.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:03.958
When I saw you, I
told Lance, I said,

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:06.961
"I'll travel seven seas
on a man-eating shark,"

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:09.597
climb Mount Everest butt-naked
with bare hands, baby,

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:13.902
"just to meet the central lady
I saw on your Facebook page."

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:16.037
For real?

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:22.142
I'm just a badass dude from
around the way, all right?

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:24.345
I'm a bodybuilding ex-con.
I got my own business.

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:27.381
I cut hair. Amongst
other things.

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:29.984
I make love all
night, every night.

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:32.286
Like it's my last night.

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.955
What? Hmm?

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:37.392
Oh, you gonna tell me?

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:43.465
Or you gonna put that on ice and
water and give it some thought?

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.433
Make yourself comfortable.

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:49.070
In your apartment
or in your world?

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:03.550
So, uh, yeah, L, you
good to go, man.

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:05.252
Unless you want to engage
in some sexual gymnastics.

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:07.221
- It's on you, brother.
- Nah, bro, I'm good.

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.490
Okay, bet. Get home safe.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.277
Ingram, come here.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.489
So the cheap bastards at my central
office finally got me a new computer.

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.124
That's cool.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.695
Yeah, it's a
touchscreen, a camera.

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:51.465
- Try it out.
- Nah, I'm good.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:54.602
It's nice, though.

01:22:59.674 --> 01:23:01.443
Have a seat.

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:09.616
So, you've been all right?

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:11.251
Yeah.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:13.620
No illegal activity?

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:18.225
- No associating with criminals?
- Nah. None of that.

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:21.062
- Been saving your money?
- I save most of my check.

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:28.702
A studio apartment will run
you about 750 a month.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.471
That's with the subsidy.

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:33.742
- Can you handle that?
- Excuse me?

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:39.513
You're leaving the
halfway house.

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:41.548
Own apartment.

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.784
No curfew.

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:46.720
Parole visits once a month.

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:50.024
You ready for that, or
you need more time here?

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:52.793
- Uh, I'm ready.
- Yeah?

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.562
Yeah.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.233
Then sign right here.

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:03.738
- Ty: To your new place.
- To L-boogie's new place.

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:22.223
I wound up in and out of
prison just like you.

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.728
Remember all those times you
used to smack me on my head

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.831
and tell me I wasn't shit?

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.635
You don't do that to your son.

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:42.077
I got my own apartment now.

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.646
I got a job.

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.682
Own business.

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:56.523
They tell me every time they
bring you to a shelter,

01:24:56.524 --> 01:25:00.227
you wind up back out here.

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.664
So, I guess this is
where you want to be.

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.756
Check it.

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:31.625
Pick out any one
of these people.

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:33.494
Imagine what their life is like.

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:36.563
Who they are. Where
they're going.

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.899
Ty: He's a Wall Street guy.

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.135
Gonna go close a
million dollar deal.

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:43.404
I can see that.

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.374
Ty: She's a fashion editor.

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:49.176
Heading to her office.

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:50.378
All right.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.515
He's a dentist. Gonna
go pull out a tooth.

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:56.717
Why the brother gotta
be bringing the pain?

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.720
'Cause he's a dentist.

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:04.292
Where's Ty?

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:15.202
Heading to work at his graphics
and animation company.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:18.906
That's what's up. Is he
carrying a college diploma?

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:23.810
Nah, he's not carrying it
around like some nerd.

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:25.546
But he's got two.

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:29.583
Hanging up on the
wall in his office.

01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:31.219
That's what's up.

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:37.558
If you can see it,
you can be it.

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:40.228
Or some corny shit like that.

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:46.466
