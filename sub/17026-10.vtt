that is now concentrated
in the red Powerball

00:02.719 --> 00:05.000

00:05.080 --> 00:07.240
It's only dishwashing,

00:07.320 --> 00:08.720
but we believe you deserve

00:08.840 --> 00:10.640

01:39.919 --> 01:41.079
Previously on ER...

01:41.079 --> 01:43.399
Alex?
Ma?

01:43.399 --> 01:46.679
He was driving
some drunk girl's car.

01:46.679 --> 01:48.599
She just...died.

01:48.599 --> 01:50.239
I let him go to the party.

01:51.759 --> 01:53.119
Forget about the deposition.

01:53.119 --> 01:55.159
If the case goes to court,
I'll testify on your behalf.

01:56.359 --> 01:58.319
You seen this guy?

01:59.519 --> 02:01.719
Morris, that storage locker
in Indiana called again.

02:01.719 --> 02:03.039
They said if you
don't pay up,

02:03.039 --> 02:04.239
they're going to sell
off your dad's stuff.

02:04.239 --> 02:07.879
BRENNER: Hold CPR. Get ready
for internal compressions.

02:17.678 --> 02:20.278
You can't just show up
at my work and drop this off.

02:20.278 --> 02:21.798
You wouldn't go
to the storage unit,

02:21.798 --> 02:23.998
so I brought it to you.
I was going to deal with it.

02:23.998 --> 02:25.878
Eventually.
What is this?

02:25.878 --> 02:27.838
It's my dad's way
of aggravating me
from the grave.

02:27.838 --> 02:29.158
This is my cousin.

02:29.158 --> 02:30.598
Simon Brenner.
Johnny.

02:30.598 --> 02:31.838
Nice to meet you.

02:31.838 --> 02:33.358
Look, I did you a favour.
This here,

02:33.358 --> 02:36.198
it's only the good stuff.
I find that hard to believe.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.038
Well, have fun.

02:40.158 --> 02:43.598
Oh, and Aunt Ethel says
thanks for the birthday card.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.318
I didn't send her
a birthday card.

02:45.318 --> 02:47.438
Exactly. Bastard.

02:48.518 --> 02:50.838
What am I supposed to do
with all this junk?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.878
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation here.

02:52.878 --> 02:55.198
Hey, Archie,
Dr Banfield's
looking for you.

02:55.198 --> 02:57.878
Great, she's gonna love this.
How about a peace offering?

02:57.878 --> 03:01.118
Somehow I don't see her really
appreciating a cheese head.

03:01.118 --> 03:03.398
Eager for a case?
Someone says

03:03.398 --> 03:04.918
"abdominal trauma,"
I come running.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.358
24-year-old female,
EGA 36 weeks.

03:06.358 --> 03:09.558
Tripped and fell during an
immigration raid at a tie factory

03:09.558 --> 03:11.598
down on North Orleans.
OK, vitals?

03:11.598 --> 03:13.478
Stable, but contracting
five minutes.

03:13.478 --> 03:14.838
I'm Dr Brenner.
What's your name?

03:14.838 --> 03:16.198
Gloria.

03:16.198 --> 03:17.838
Is there any bleeding?

03:17.838 --> 03:19.558
Unh-uh, BP's
124 over 81.

03:19.558 --> 03:21.718
(SCREAMS)
Where are you going?

03:21.718 --> 03:23.798
This is a case for OB.
Yeah, but she still

03:23.798 --> 03:25.398
needs a trauma assessment.
We're gonna help you.

03:25.398 --> 03:26.998
I'll give you my blessing,
but she's an OB patient.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.638
I'm gonna page Coburn.
OK.

03:28.638 --> 03:30.638
Hang in there, Gloria.
Please!

03:30.638 --> 03:31.958
CRYING: My baby.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.918
Oh, Dr Banfield.

03:33.918 --> 03:36.678
I need to skedaddle
just a little early today

03:36.678 --> 03:39.278
to get in, er, character
for the Christmas party.

03:39.278 --> 03:42.158
Never met a costume you
didn't like, huh, Frank?
No, ma'am.

03:42.158 --> 03:43.558
Oh, and your other
half called.

03:43.558 --> 03:45.558
Wanted to know what time
to be here for said party.

03:47.198 --> 03:48.758
You're going to the party?

03:48.758 --> 03:50.918
You say that like I don't know
how to have a good time.

03:50.918 --> 03:52.118
That's not at all
what I meant.

03:52.118 --> 03:53.477
BRENNER: Is there anyone
you want us to call?

03:53.477 --> 03:55.197
What's open?
My husband.

03:55.197 --> 03:57.157
But he doesn't need to come.
BANFIELD: Trauma one. Meed a hand?

03:57.157 --> 03:58.557
We got it.
FRANK: Here you go, jock itch.

03:58.557 --> 04:00.317
Oh, you sweet talker, you.

04:00.317 --> 04:01.957
Oh, oh, hang on.

04:01.957 --> 04:03.757
You're not seeing
patients today.

04:03.757 --> 04:06.917
I need you to do the
intern mid-year reviews.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.597
I'd rather do
the jock itch.
Too bad.

04:08.597 --> 04:10.517
But, but, er,
Dr Brenner

04:10.517 --> 04:12.037
is great at paperwork.

04:12.037 --> 04:13.397
Terrific penmanship.

04:13.397 --> 04:15.957
ROXANNE:
Yoo-hoo, Dr Morris.

04:15.957 --> 04:18.397
Hello, Mrs Gaines.
Hello.

04:18.397 --> 04:20.317
I need refills
for my cholesterol

04:20.317 --> 04:22.237
and blood pressure pills,
and I also need...

04:22.237 --> 04:23.997
Well, you know what,
I would love to help you,

04:23.997 --> 04:26.757
Mrs Gaines, but I'm not seeing
patients today.
Oh.

04:26.757 --> 04:29.837
Dr Morris, you can go ahead...
No, rules are rules.

04:29.837 --> 04:33.837
However, Dr Sanchez here
would love to help you.

04:33.837 --> 04:35.957
OK, my work
here is done.

04:35.957 --> 04:38.797
I brought you folks
some brownies.

04:38.797 --> 04:41.077
I made them myself.
Awesome.

04:41.077 --> 04:42.997
Hey, Frank, did
psych come down
on my hair puller?

04:42.997 --> 04:44.037
Not yet.
Ooh!

04:44.037 --> 04:45.517
Don't eat at the desk.

04:45.517 --> 04:46.957
I will go.
RYAN: Right this way.

04:46.957 --> 04:48.237
ROXANNE:
Oh, well, thank you.

04:48.237 --> 04:49.597
Brownies?
No, I'm good.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.237
Dr Gates, any word
on your homeless vet?

04:53.237 --> 04:55.317
Nah, I seem to have
hit a dead end.

04:55.317 --> 04:57.157
All right, well,
I'll put call a call in

04:57.157 --> 04:58.797
to a friend of mine at
Midnight Ministries,

04:58.797 --> 05:00.077
so maybe she'll
know something.

05:00.077 --> 05:01.917
Thanks, I appreciate that.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.477
I gotta run upstairs
for a minute.

05:06.157 --> 05:07.597
Is Sam coming in today?

05:07.597 --> 05:08.917
Should be.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.957
Heard she wanted
to get back to work.

05:10.957 --> 05:12.077
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

05:22.077 --> 05:23.717
They're getting ready
to extubate Alex.

05:27.597 --> 05:29.676
MARISOL:
He's fighting the vent.

05:29.676 --> 05:30.956
Sats are dropping.
He's biting the tube.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.396
He wants off.
He's agitated, Sam.

05:33.396 --> 05:35.516
Hang on, hang on.

05:35.516 --> 05:38.516
Mm-mm, 40 milligrams
propofol IV push.

05:38.516 --> 05:40.116
No, no, no, please,
don't give up!

05:40.116 --> 05:41.436
Sorry, we can't
extubate like this, Sam.

05:41.436 --> 05:42.556
He's right.
Well, he'll calm down.

05:42.556 --> 05:44.036
Just give him a minute.

05:44.036 --> 05:45.996
Restart the drip at six
milligrams a minute.

05:47.316 --> 05:49.636
MARISOL:
Sedation's in.

05:49.636 --> 05:53.156
Sorry, Sam. We'll see where
we are again tomorrow, OK?

06:16.556 --> 06:18.596
MAN: Um, excuse me.

06:18.596 --> 06:20.716
Is Dr Morris working today?

06:20.716 --> 06:24.356
Uh...yeah,
he's, he's somewhere.

06:24.356 --> 06:26.836
FRANK: Jerry?!

06:26.836 --> 06:28.516
What brings you
to our neck of the woods?

06:28.516 --> 06:30.196
I thought you were
up in Alaska.

06:30.196 --> 06:31.836
Yeah, I got tired
of slinging beers,

06:31.836 --> 06:34.156
so I moved back.
Hey, Archie!

06:34.156 --> 06:36.276
Look what the world's
largest cat dragged in.

06:36.276 --> 06:37.596
Jerry, my man!
Hey.

06:37.596 --> 06:39.676
How you doing, brother?
Fine, how are you?

06:39.676 --> 06:42.196
Good. Dr Morris, do you
realise there's large

06:42.196 --> 06:44.636
storage unit in the bay
with your name on it?

06:44.636 --> 06:46.436
I'm trying to get rid of it.
Burn it, donate it -

06:46.436 --> 06:48.116
I don't care -
I want it out of here.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.236
Sell everything.
You know, one man's trash

06:50.236 --> 06:52.476
is another man's cash.
When do I have time for that?

06:52.476 --> 06:53.476
I'll do it.

06:53.476 --> 06:55.436
You will? seriously?

06:55.436 --> 06:57.956
Yeah, I love a good
fire sale.
Excellent.

06:57.956 --> 06:59.476
You know,
I'll tell you what.

06:59.476 --> 07:00.956
I will give you ten percent...

07:00.956 --> 07:02.716
Ten?

07:02.716 --> 07:04.675
Fifteen.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.435
Man, it's cold outside.

07:06.435 --> 07:07.555
OK, fine.

07:07.555 --> 07:09.915
50 percent of whatever
you bring in.

07:09.915 --> 07:11.435
You can't miss it, OK?

07:11.435 --> 07:12.915
And paper money only,
none of this

07:12.915 --> 07:14.115
"I want everything
for a quarter" crap.

07:14.115 --> 07:15.515
You don't even
want to look through it?

07:15.515 --> 07:17.155
I made it this far
without that junk.

07:17.155 --> 07:18.755
I don't need to weigh
myself down now.

07:20.035 --> 07:21.555
Oh, welcome back.

07:21.555 --> 07:22.675
How's Alex doing?

07:22.675 --> 07:24.315
Well, he's still sedated.

07:24.315 --> 07:26.795
You know, they tried to extubate
him this morning, but...

07:26.795 --> 07:27.955
He'll be off
the vent soon.

07:27.955 --> 07:29.235
You don't know that.

07:30.515 --> 07:32.515
I mean, I thought
he would be talking by now.

07:32.515 --> 07:35.355
But he was
hypotensive for so long.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.275
You know, what if he has
brain damage?

07:37.275 --> 07:39.635
Or what if he just never gets
off the vent? It's...

07:39.635 --> 07:42.675
Look, Sam, if you need
to take a little more time...

07:42.675 --> 07:44.555
No, no.

07:44.555 --> 07:46.115
I really should keep busy,
you know?

07:46.115 --> 07:48.555
I can't just keep sitting there,
staring at Alex's monitors.

07:50.355 --> 07:52.035
But thank you
for the offer.
Mm.

07:52.035 --> 07:53.875
Come on, let's get
some coffee first.

07:54.995 --> 07:56.555
RASGOTRA:
Chest is clear.

07:56.555 --> 07:57.995
How are you
feeling, Gloria?

07:57.995 --> 08:00.915
OK.
Did you reach my husband?

08:00.915 --> 08:02.435
He's on his way.

08:02.435 --> 08:03.675
He doesn't have to come.

08:03.675 --> 08:04.995
I can call him later.

08:04.995 --> 08:07.995
Cap refill's good. You know,
he's probably worried about you.

08:07.995 --> 08:09.515
How long have
you two been together?

08:09.515 --> 08:11.595
We met at the aquarium.

08:11.595 --> 08:14.075
I was 15.
Wow.

08:14.075 --> 08:15.795
Can't imagine being married
to my high school boyfriend.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.075
We were both new to America.

08:18.075 --> 08:20.755
How's the crit?
Stable at 39.

08:20.755 --> 08:22.875
So everyone going
to the Christmas party?

08:22.875 --> 08:24.395
Not a chance.

08:24.395 --> 08:26.155
Yeah, but surgery's hosting it
this year.

08:26.155 --> 08:27.355
You have to go.
Belly's benign.

08:27.355 --> 08:29.635
Archie pinched
my butt last year,

08:29.635 --> 08:31.995
and Frank nearly threw up on me.
That sounds like fun.

08:31.995 --> 08:34.595
Can't imagine why anyone
would want to miss that.

08:34.595 --> 08:36.395
Fetal heart rate's at 145.

08:36.395 --> 08:37.595
You're not into the party?

08:37.595 --> 08:39.794
A work party?
At work?

08:39.794 --> 08:41.234
Yeah, no, thanks.

08:41.234 --> 08:44.234
I got a hot date
with a stock broker.

08:44.234 --> 08:46.274
So while you losers are
drinking virgin eggnog,

08:46.274 --> 08:48.034
I'm going to be sipping
Veuve Clicquot.

08:48.034 --> 08:49.954
(SCREAMS)
It's OK.

08:49.954 --> 08:52.754
They're every three minutes now.
Breathe, Gloria.

08:52.754 --> 08:55.154
Breathe.
RASGOTRA: She's on mag?

08:55.154 --> 08:56.354
Yeah, but it's
not doing much.

08:56.354 --> 08:58.154
OB can take it from here.
She's clear surgically.

08:58.154 --> 09:00.274
All right, Coburn's on her way.

09:00.274 --> 09:02.914
FRANK: This is Mrs Ortiz' husband.
Mi amor.

09:02.914 --> 09:06.834
Mi amor, todo esta bien?
Roberto, que haces aqui?

09:06.834 --> 09:10.114
No debiste haber venido.
Is the baby OK?

09:10.114 --> 09:11.474
We're just checking
to make sure.

09:11.474 --> 09:14.714
Do you know if it's
a girl or a boy, Mrs Ortiz?

09:14.714 --> 09:17.514
At my last ultrasound,
it was too soon to tell.

09:19.554 --> 09:22.194
QUIETLY:
What are we looking at?

09:22.194 --> 09:25.114
(GROANS)
Something wrong?

09:25.114 --> 09:28.074
Is that a twin, maybe?
I'm not sure.

09:29.914 --> 09:31.034
GATES: Getting back to work

09:31.034 --> 09:32.394
will probably be good
for you, right?

09:32.394 --> 09:33.394
A little distraction?

09:33.394 --> 09:35.354
Yeah, I could
use the money.

09:35.354 --> 09:36.474
Oh, excuse me.

09:36.474 --> 09:37.794
Hey, excuse me, sir!

09:37.794 --> 09:40.154
Your kids need
to be buckled up.
Sorry, what?

09:40.154 --> 09:41.954
Your kids need to be
wearing seat belts.

09:41.954 --> 09:43.234
OK, lady, whatever you say.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.474
She's just saying
it's probably better

09:44.474 --> 09:45.954
if the kids had their
seatbelts on, that's all.

09:45.954 --> 09:47.154
You know what, it's the law,
and it's common sense.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.594
Who the hell asked you?

09:48.594 --> 09:49.554
She's saying it'd be better
Hey!

09:49.554 --> 09:50.514
if the kids
were buckled up.

09:50.514 --> 09:51.594
That's all.
Hey, screw off!

09:51.594 --> 09:52.834
Hey, watch it.
All right?

09:52.834 --> 09:54.034
How are you
gonna feel, huh?

09:54.034 --> 09:56.154
If one comes through
that windshield,

09:56.154 --> 09:57.594
and ends up in
the ER with brains

09:57.594 --> 09:58.674
coming out of
his skull, huh?

09:58.674 --> 10:00.154
HORN HONKS
You're an idiot!

10:00.154 --> 10:01.914
You know that?
It's idiots like you
Get out of the way!

10:01.914 --> 10:03.634
that keep our hospital
from shutting down,

10:03.634 --> 10:06.234
so thank you very much!
Sam, Sam, Sam...

10:06.234 --> 10:07.434
Let it go.
Let it go.
Idiot.

10:07.434 --> 10:08.634
Let it go.

10:10.674 --> 10:12.874
How long do I have
to wait for my refills?

10:12.874 --> 10:14.593
Uh, check
with Dr Sanchez.

10:14.593 --> 10:17.073
I did.
He said something about spiders

10:17.073 --> 10:18.753
and wandered away.

10:18.753 --> 10:20.913
Well, if I see him,
I will send him your way.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.593
Thank you.
Did you have that
necklace on earlier?

10:23.593 --> 10:26.393
I got it from that
big man outside.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.553
(CHUCKLES)

10:28.553 --> 10:32.353
He wouldn't know a Hattie Carnegie
piece if it bit him in the ass.

10:32.353 --> 10:34.913
I know, because
I was a buyer

10:34.913 --> 10:37.473
for Marshall Field
for 40 years.

10:37.473 --> 10:39.633
Well, you wear it well.
Thank you.

10:39.633 --> 10:41.393
Oh, and you should know,

10:41.393 --> 10:43.273
the original owner
of that necklace?
Mm-hm?

10:43.273 --> 10:44.313
She was a saint.

10:44.313 --> 10:46.073
CELL PHONE RINGS
Aw... Ooh!

10:46.073 --> 10:47.513
Frank, have you seen

10:47.513 --> 10:49.233
the intern evaluation forms?
Hello?

10:49.233 --> 10:50.633
Let's see, the
last I looked,

10:50.633 --> 10:52.353
they were right here.
Thank you.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.593
I got myself
a little something

10:54.593 --> 10:56.233
from the Morris
family estate.

10:56.233 --> 10:58.433
Let me guess,
a nice broach?

10:58.433 --> 11:02.073
A baseball signed
by joltin' Joe Dimaggio

11:02.073 --> 11:04.593
and some
no-name Yankee.

11:04.593 --> 11:06.393
Yeah, no, that was me.

11:06.393 --> 11:07.833
"Archie Morris."

11:07.833 --> 11:09.273
My dad was pissed.

11:09.273 --> 11:10.753
I couldn't sit
down for a week.

11:10.753 --> 11:14.313
Listen, um,
that was my friend Ida.

11:14.313 --> 11:17.073
I-I-I need to find
Dr Sanchez.
If I see him,

11:17.073 --> 11:18.673
you will be the first to know.
Oh, no, no, no.

11:18.673 --> 11:20.393
No, this is really important.

11:20.393 --> 11:21.473
What do we have?

11:21.473 --> 11:23.233
Renee Weber-stewart, 39.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.393
She passed out
at the mall.

11:24.393 --> 11:27.393
All right, let's take
her to exam three.

11:27.393 --> 11:29.713
We were waiting for Santa.
BARDELLI: She has
a six-month-old, Lola.

11:29.713 --> 11:30.953
Mom broke her fall,

11:30.953 --> 11:32.753
but you might want to
check on the baby, too.

11:32.753 --> 11:33.833
Belly's distended,
systolic's only

11:33.833 --> 11:36.433
84 after a litre.
My wife, Nicole...

11:36.433 --> 11:38.193
We'll call her
for you, ma'am.
I have the number.

11:38.193 --> 11:40.153
Could be vagal, but she's
still pretty out of it.

11:40.153 --> 11:41.593
Have social services
watch the baby

11:41.593 --> 11:43.033
until we can get
a family member here.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.473
Oh, that's OK.
I'll look after her.

11:44.473 --> 11:46.393
Ah...

11:46.393 --> 11:48.553
Hi, you little reindeer.

11:48.553 --> 11:50.792
It's OK, we're going to get
you right back to Rudolph.

11:50.792 --> 11:52.912
Oh, hi.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.672
Aren't you a cute baby?

11:54.672 --> 11:55.792
Oh, Frank?

11:55.792 --> 11:57.112
Frank, still no psych?

11:57.112 --> 11:58.432
I'll call again.

11:59.912 --> 12:01.192
Hey, I'm saving
that for later.

12:01.192 --> 12:02.592
OK, you still have one left.

12:02.592 --> 12:04.432
I'm sorry, I'm hungry.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.712
We're from immigration.

12:05.712 --> 12:07.952
We're looking for
a patient - Gloria ortiz.

12:07.952 --> 12:11.592
Mom's five centimeters dilated
and maxed out on terb and mag.

12:11.592 --> 12:13.832
Can you tell
if it's a boy or a girl?

12:13.832 --> 12:14.912
It's a boy.

12:14.912 --> 12:16.512
(SIGHS)
We're having a boy.

12:16.512 --> 12:17.992
TRACY: Second IV is in.

12:17.992 --> 12:19.432
GLORIA: We're having a boy.

12:19.432 --> 12:22.112
Did you hear that, Roberto?

12:23.592 --> 12:25.072
A boy.
That's great.

12:25.072 --> 12:26.832
RASGOTRA: This is what
we were looking at.

12:26.832 --> 12:28.112
We thought it might be
a multiple gestation...

12:28.112 --> 12:30.392
There's only one heartbeat.
Yeah, it's not a twin.

12:30.392 --> 12:33.112
Are you sure?
(SIGHS)

12:33.112 --> 12:34.912
What's wrong?

12:34.912 --> 12:36.952
COBURN: All right,
Mr and Mrs Ortiz,

12:36.952 --> 12:39.352
the ultrasound shows
that your baby

12:39.352 --> 12:41.672
has a large mass involving
the lower face and neck.

12:41.672 --> 12:45.232
A mass? What does that mean?
Does my baby have cancer?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.592
The ultrasound doesn't tell us
if it's cancerous.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.152
COBURN: Right now,
the most pressing issue

12:49.152 --> 12:50.992
is that the medications aren't
stopping your contractions.

12:50.992 --> 12:52.672
What are you saying?
RASGOTRA: We're gonna do

12:52.672 --> 12:54.512
everything we can
for your baby.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.992
FRANK: There are two Immigration
agents at the desk who want to talk

12:57.992 --> 12:59.672
to your patient.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

13:02.032 --> 13:05.192
We're kind of busy.
They don't seem
like the type to wait.

13:05.192 --> 13:06.432
RASGOTRA: Well,
they're gonna have to.

13:06.432 --> 13:07.912
What do we do now?

13:07.912 --> 13:10.472
COBURN: All right, your baby
needs to be delivered.

13:10.472 --> 13:13.552
Por favour.
Tienes que irte, por favour.

13:13.552 --> 13:14.872
No te voy a dejar.

13:14.872 --> 13:15.992
Mi amor...

13:15.992 --> 13:17.392
Si.

13:25.031 --> 13:26.591
(GRUNTING)

13:28.751 --> 13:30.151
Is this Gloria Ortiz?

13:30.151 --> 13:32.431
We're doing an exam in here.
What do you need?

13:32.431 --> 13:34.351
We're here to take
Mrs Ortiz into custody.

13:34.351 --> 13:37.231
What for?
She's a fugitive alien.
She's being deported.

14:23.671 --> 14:24.591
With the menopause,

14:24.671 --> 14:26.631
skin can lose substance.

14:26.711 --> 14:28.671
It begins to sag and look dull.

14:29.351 --> 14:31.551
L'Oreal creates new Age Perfect

14:31.631 --> 14:33.191
with soya bean extract.

14:33.311 --> 14:35.791
Our first
reinforcing skincare range

14:35.871 --> 14:38.271
to target signs of menopausal skin.

14:38.991 --> 14:39.911
It helps fight

14:39.991 --> 14:41.551
the appearance of age spots

14:41.671 --> 14:45.031
and leaves skin feeling firmer
to help combat sagging.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.111
New Age
Perfect

14:46.231 --> 14:47.471
reinforcing
programme

14:47.591 --> 14:48.791
from
L'Oreal Paris.

14:48.871 --> 14:50.871
Take control of your skin every day.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.351
Because
we're worth it!

15:23.270 --> 15:25.150
In this week's Closer

15:33.470 --> 15:34.950

Oh, yeah! Come on!

15:59.190 --> 16:00.230

16:01.070 --> 16:09.430
SLURPING TO THE TUNE OF

16:10.150 --> 16:11.110
Brian?!

16:11.190 --> 16:12.270
Oh, yeah!

16:16.790 --> 16:18.390
Dogs know
what they like.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.390
That's why Pedigree
are teaming up

16:20.470 --> 16:22.550
with the hit movie "Marley & Me".

16:23.590 --> 16:24.950
They're adorable!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.030
Marley!

16:32.110 --> 16:33.350
To celebrate the film's release,

16:33.430 --> 16:34.829
we're offering millions of rewards

16:44.829 --> 16:46.109
with all this stuff
from your clear-out.

16:46.189 --> 16:47.189
Too true, Happy.

16:47.309 --> 16:49.269
We could give away
something free, too.

16:49.389 --> 16:51.469
- Contents insurance.
- What?

16:51.549 --> 16:53.029
Ooh!

16:55.149 --> 16:57.989
I thought you said
free contents insurance.

16:58.069 --> 16:59.109
Get your buildings insurance

16:59.189 --> 17:00.229

17:00.349 --> 17:01.349

contents insurance

17:01.469 --> 17:02.389
absolutely
free.

17:17.148 --> 17:19.148
# Here come the girls!

17:19.148 --> 17:21.348
Like mother, like daughter.

17:21.348 --> 17:22.549

17:22.549 --> 17:23.829
makes her feel great.

17:23.829 --> 17:26.628
That's why we're offering up
to a third off

17:26.628 --> 17:28.589
beautiful Mother's Day
gifts at Boots

18:43.668 --> 18:45.228
This yarn is so soft.

18:45.228 --> 18:49.788
Yeah, my mom spent the '70s
obsessed with macrame.

18:49.788 --> 18:51.308
Vests?
Yeah.

18:51.308 --> 18:53.668
My first grade
class picture...

18:53.668 --> 18:55.428
rocking a blue
macrame vest.

18:55.428 --> 18:57.588
It's like no matter
where it is,

18:57.588 --> 18:59.428
it's staring at me.

18:59.428 --> 19:00.708
TRACY: Oh, hey,
come to the OR.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.948
Dr Brenner's letting us watch
an exit procedure.

19:02.948 --> 19:04.788
What?
You know, it's when
they section the mom

19:04.788 --> 19:06.108
to get an airway
on the baby

19:06.108 --> 19:07.308
before the delivery.

19:07.308 --> 19:09.228
I mean, can you imagine?

19:09.228 --> 19:10.868
Hey, did you hear me?

19:10.868 --> 19:12.148
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:12.148 --> 19:13.148
Airways,
airways, baby.

19:13.148 --> 19:14.308
Here.
No...er, no.

19:14.308 --> 19:17.548
Uh, listen, have either
of you seen Dr Sanchez?

19:17.548 --> 19:18.588
Oh, he's over there.

19:18.588 --> 19:19.788
Oh...oh, er,

19:19.788 --> 19:21.468
that's not one
of my brownies, is it?

19:21.468 --> 19:23.188
Why, is it bad?
I ate two.

19:23.188 --> 19:25.468
How are you feeling, dear?

19:25.468 --> 19:26.548
Hey, that's
my jell-o.

19:26.548 --> 19:28.028
You shouldn't
be eating my food.

19:28.028 --> 19:29.828
It's OK,
I'm a doctor.

19:29.828 --> 19:31.468
Dr Sanchez.

19:34.908 --> 19:36.788
What are you doing?

19:36.788 --> 19:38.668
Wiggling and jiggling.

19:38.668 --> 19:39.788
Put that back.

19:39.788 --> 19:41.108
WHISPERS: Yeah.

19:41.108 --> 19:43.187
Oh, doctor, doctor,
he's high as a kite.

19:43.187 --> 19:45.467
The brownies
have cannabis in them.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.947
You gave pot brownies
to my staff?

19:51.947 --> 19:53.747
Do you know how
dangerous that is?

19:53.747 --> 19:55.427
They could have
mistreated a patient.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.827
I know, it was a mistake.

19:56.827 --> 19:58.107
You see, my friend ida

19:58.107 --> 20:01.227
had cancer, and I made
special brownies for her.

20:01.227 --> 20:03.347
Now she's in remission,
thank the Lord,

20:03.347 --> 20:07.027
but she still likes them,
and I mixed up the batches.

20:09.987 --> 20:11.427
You two are done
for the day.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.067
Drink some water,
take a nap.

20:13.067 --> 20:15.747
Whatever you do, do not drive home
till you're clean and sober.

20:21.147 --> 20:25.067
JERRY: Pick any three eight-track
tapes for the price of two.

20:26.427 --> 20:27.867
Mr Ortiz?

20:27.867 --> 20:29.267
How is Gloria?

20:29.267 --> 20:30.907
Is she OK?

20:30.907 --> 20:34.227
She's fine, but we're worried
the tumour on your son's neck

20:34.227 --> 20:35.507
could prevent him
from breathing normally.

20:35.507 --> 20:37.987
So, fix it.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.347
Can you fix it?
Well, we're gonna

20:39.347 --> 20:40.867
do a Cesarean section
so we can insert

20:40.867 --> 20:42.227
a breathing tube
while he's still attached

20:42.227 --> 20:43.907
to the placenta.

20:43.907 --> 20:45.107
I don't understand...
Well, that way,

20:45.107 --> 20:46.347
Gloria's body can supply him
with oxygen

20:46.347 --> 20:47.507
until he can breathe on his own.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.027
Wait, she's having
the baby today?

20:50.027 --> 20:51.187
We're prepping her for surgery.

20:51.187 --> 20:52.667
No, I can't.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.467
No, not like this.
But we have to.

20:54.467 --> 20:55.387
Are they still there?

20:56.427 --> 20:58.587
Did you know immigration
was after her?

21:00.907 --> 21:02.827
We're undocumented.

21:02.827 --> 21:04.107
Two years ago,

21:04.107 --> 21:06.227
they scheduled her
for deportation,

21:06.227 --> 21:08.107
but she didn't show up.

21:08.107 --> 21:10.307
I couldn't
let her go.

21:10.307 --> 21:11.867
Our life is here.
BEEPING

21:11.867 --> 21:13.667
I'm so sorry -
I have to get back.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.227
I'll call you
when we're out of surgery.

21:15.227 --> 21:17.187
We're not bad people.

21:17.187 --> 21:18.866
We never harmed anyone.

21:20.066 --> 21:21.506
We only want to be happy.

21:24.226 --> 21:25.706
Frank gave this
to me.

21:25.706 --> 21:27.546
Oh, that was
my mom's.

21:27.546 --> 21:28.786
That's your story, huh?

21:28.786 --> 21:30.186
You want it back?

21:30.186 --> 21:31.466
No, I'd break it.

21:31.466 --> 21:33.986
When I was nine, I juggled
the holy family set.

21:33.986 --> 21:36.026
And?
I'm not sure what
upset my mom more,

21:36.026 --> 21:37.266
that I broke
her hummels

21:37.266 --> 21:38.826
or I tossed around
the baby Jesus.

21:38.826 --> 21:41.306
Only time she ever
raised her voice at me.

21:41.306 --> 21:44.226
Well, I don't juggle,
so I think this one's safe.

21:44.226 --> 21:46.786
Dr Banfield, this is, er,
Nicole, Renee's partner.

21:46.786 --> 21:47.786
Hi.

21:47.786 --> 21:48.906
Is she OK?

21:48.906 --> 21:49.946
She's doing better.

21:49.946 --> 21:51.106
Can I see her?

21:51.106 --> 21:53.026
Right this way.

21:53.026 --> 21:54.306
Uh, where's Lola?

21:54.306 --> 21:55.746
Oh, one of our nurses
is baby-sitting.

21:55.746 --> 21:57.026
I'll go get her.

21:57.026 --> 21:59.266
Now, she's still a little
sedated from the cat scan.

21:59.266 --> 22:00.546
What's wrong?

22:00.546 --> 22:02.786
We're not sure yet,
but we noticed

22:02.786 --> 22:04.986
the surgical scar
on her abdomen.

22:04.986 --> 22:06.506
Do you know
what it's from?

22:06.506 --> 22:08.026
She had cancer of
the small bowel,

22:08.026 --> 22:09.866
but she's been in
remission for three years.

22:13.546 --> 22:16.186
What does this have to do
with her passing out?

22:16.186 --> 22:19.266
Her belly is distended,
and we're concerned.

22:19.266 --> 22:20.706
Oh, God.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.386
Is that what you think,

22:22.386 --> 22:23.546
that the cancer's back?

22:23.546 --> 22:25.346
We'll know more
when we get the CT results.

22:31.826 --> 22:33.626
TAGGART:
This one is mine.

22:33.626 --> 22:36.066
I got this when Alex and
I lived in Albuquerque.

22:36.066 --> 22:38.986
He was just a baby then.

22:38.986 --> 22:40.866
And this one's Haleh's.

22:40.866 --> 22:43.026
It was a gift from her grandma.

22:43.026 --> 22:44.546
And look, look.

22:44.546 --> 22:45.666
There's Frank.

22:45.666 --> 22:47.386
That one's his, obviously.

22:47.386 --> 22:49.026
It's pretty silly, huh?

22:49.026 --> 22:51.746
Sam, you can take Lola
back to her mom now.

22:55.385 --> 22:56.985
Bye, little reindeer.

23:00.465 --> 23:01.785
Bye.

23:05.545 --> 23:06.865
You OK?

23:06.865 --> 23:09.065
No, not even
a little bit.

23:11.665 --> 23:13.305
(SIGHS)

23:15.305 --> 23:17.505
I remember
this one Christmas,

23:17.505 --> 23:20.465
Alex begged me
for a skateboard.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.665
When I gave it to him,
he was so excited.

23:24.265 --> 23:25.905
And then I made him
wear a helmet.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.905
You were looking out for him.

23:27.905 --> 23:30.025
Do everything you can
to keep them safe,

23:30.025 --> 23:32.425
and then...he ends up
on a ventilator.

23:32.425 --> 23:33.505
Sam.

23:33.505 --> 23:35.065
He's been tubed
for almost a week.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.665
What's next?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.785
He's gonna be on a trake
his whole life?

23:38.785 --> 23:40.145
Come on,
let's not jump the gun.

23:40.145 --> 23:41.225
They're gonna
extubate tomorrow.

23:42.785 --> 23:44.905
Yeah, I asked Dubenko if
they could try again tonight,

23:44.905 --> 23:47.105
but he said they only
do it before noon.

23:47.105 --> 23:50.425
Well, he's just
following the rules.

23:50.425 --> 23:52.425
Why do you do that?

23:53.465 --> 23:55.105
What?

23:55.105 --> 23:58.825
Why do you always take
the other side?

23:59.825 --> 24:01.705
I'm just trying to help.

24:01.705 --> 24:03.625
Yeah, well, then,
take my side.

24:03.625 --> 24:05.825
All right,
well, then,

24:05.825 --> 24:08.625
let's tell Dubenko
that his rules are stupid

24:08.625 --> 24:10.305
and maybe he'll make
an exception.

24:10.305 --> 24:11.545
You never know.

24:14.265 --> 24:17.185
SURGEONS GIVE INSTRUCTIONS

24:17.185 --> 24:19.585
Where did you
get that?
Surgical lounge.

24:19.585 --> 24:21.185
Want some?

24:21.185 --> 24:22.985
Ew, no, thanks.

24:22.985 --> 24:24.945
RASGOTRA:
Amnio infusion's underway.

24:24.945 --> 24:26.345
COBURN:
OK, people, here we go.

24:27.985 --> 24:30.344
Hey, you guys...look.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.144
COBURN:
Watch the head.

24:33.744 --> 24:36.264
RASGOTRA:
50 atropine, 30 of fentanyl IM.

24:38.384 --> 24:40.664
OK, vecuronium's in.
Clock is ticking.

24:40.664 --> 24:42.584
OK, miller zero and
three-five - let's go.

24:47.744 --> 24:49.104
GATES: The scan shows

24:49.104 --> 24:51.384
some abnormal tissue wrapped
around part of the liver.

24:51.384 --> 24:53.424
The cancer is back.

24:53.424 --> 24:54.584
Most likely.

24:57.624 --> 24:58.664
What's next?

24:59.744 --> 25:01.504
We'll talk
to a surgeon

25:01.504 --> 25:03.104
and find out
what the options are.

25:03.104 --> 25:04.664
Uh, run the scan
by Dr Dubenko.

25:07.544 --> 25:10.024
It was in the
lymph nodes.

25:10.024 --> 25:11.384
Yeah.

25:11.384 --> 25:12.424
We knew a recurrence

25:12.424 --> 25:13.504
was likely.

25:13.504 --> 25:15.024
RENEE:
I convinced myself

25:15.024 --> 25:17.904
that I was
gonna be lucky,

25:17.904 --> 25:20.384
that I could
dodge the bullet.

25:20.384 --> 25:22.904
Well, that's a great attitude
to have.

25:23.944 --> 25:25.424
She doesn't understand
the concept

25:25.424 --> 25:26.904
of, "the glass
is half empty."

25:26.904 --> 25:28.944
I finally
met someone

25:28.944 --> 25:30.864
that I couldn't
live without,

25:30.864 --> 25:32.224
and that's no
time to give up.

25:34.904 --> 25:36.544
A week before
the surgery,

25:36.544 --> 25:38.304
we flew to Boston
and got married.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.424
And we ran off like
a couple of teenagers.

25:42.784 --> 25:44.304
That's quite a leap of faith.

25:45.664 --> 25:47.824
It's not hard when you have
someone to hang on to.

25:52.224 --> 25:54.344
So, what is going to happen
once she's out of surgery?

25:54.344 --> 25:56.384
She'll be detained by immigration
till they deport her.

25:56.384 --> 25:58.784
What about her recovery?
Let's try Miller one.

25:58.784 --> 26:00.064
Detention facilities
have doctors.

26:00.064 --> 26:01.024
Not good ones.

26:01.024 --> 26:02.544
I can't get a good view.

26:02.544 --> 26:05.503
Suction. Can't we keep her
until the baby's DC'd?

26:05.503 --> 26:07.623
Wee can't justify that -
baby needs to be in the nicu

26:07.623 --> 26:09.983
for at least
three weeks.
Well, if people knew...

26:09.983 --> 26:11.503
Fetal heart
rate's 138.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.943
And by "people," you
mean the 10:00 news?
Couldn't hurt.

26:13.943 --> 26:16.543
Put a magnifying glass
on our hospital like that,

26:16.543 --> 26:18.343
public perception will be,
"Go to county, get deported."

26:18.343 --> 26:20.623
RASGOTRA: How's the sat?
Holding at 52.

26:20.623 --> 26:22.143
Nothing we can do?

26:22.143 --> 26:23.783
We're doing it.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.303
RASGOTRA: No, it's too distorted.
Suction.

26:26.303 --> 26:28.623
COBURN: Uterine bleeding!
Switch with me, Neela.

26:28.623 --> 26:30.823
Rigid bronch!
I can't get on it...

26:30.823 --> 26:32.543
Step aside.
You're taking too long.

26:32.543 --> 26:33.703
Mom's systolic's only 84.

26:33.703 --> 26:35.143
OK, guys, time's up.
we gotta clamp,

26:35.143 --> 26:36.303
whether you got
the airway in or not.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.503
Just hold on. 78.
This is a mess.

26:38.503 --> 26:40.543
If we don't get a handle on
this, Mom is gonna bleed out

26:40.543 --> 26:42.543
and we're gonna lose
the baby, too. Damn it!

26:42.543 --> 26:45.183
OK, type specific
and point 25 methergine now!

26:45.183 --> 26:46.863
ALARMS BLARING

26:49.423 --> 26:51.903
I have to cut the cord. Not without
an airway. We have no choice!

26:51.903 --> 26:52.903
The baby's not getting
enough oxygen,

26:52.903 --> 26:55.743
he can't tolerate...
We bail out now or lose 'em both.

26:55.743 --> 26:57.903
How about a tracheotomy?
Not yet.

26:57.903 --> 27:01.823
Dr Dubenko, I've got a woman...
Find Anspaugh. Dr Banfield...

27:01.823 --> 27:03.383
Find Anspaugh!

27:03.383 --> 27:05.303
Got it. Sorry.

27:05.303 --> 27:06.623
COBURN: Lucien.

27:08.823 --> 27:10.383
Screw it.
We'll do the trake.

27:10.383 --> 27:12.983
Five minutes is all you've got.
Let's go. Let's go.

27:12.983 --> 27:14.503
15 blade and 3-0 shiley.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.423
Nicole?

27:27.503 --> 27:30.103
What's the word
from the surgeon?

27:30.103 --> 27:31.703
Uh, none yet.

27:33.703 --> 27:35.623
How are you doing?

27:35.623 --> 27:37.543
Mmm.

27:42.342 --> 27:45.542
what if this is it?

27:45.542 --> 27:48.342
Lola won't
remember her.

27:49.342 --> 27:51.302
You will.

27:51.302 --> 27:54.102
And you'll make sure
your baby does, too.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.222
I feel like I might forget.

28:00.662 --> 28:02.382
(CRYING)

28:02.382 --> 28:04.302
Just the little things.

28:04.302 --> 28:05.462
(SNIFFLING)

28:05.462 --> 28:07.382
Just the little things.

28:09.222 --> 28:11.702
Uh, how she burns
the roof of her mouth

28:11.702 --> 28:13.462
on pizza -

28:13.462 --> 28:15.822
every time.

28:15.822 --> 28:20.542
Or how she slaps my arm
when she laughs and....

28:21.862 --> 28:24.662
You won't forget
those things.

28:26.662 --> 28:29.502
(SOBBING)

28:29.502 --> 28:31.462
You won't.

29:18.061 --> 29:18.701
Talk
to me!

29:18.781 --> 29:20.501
Superstay 18-hour lipcolour

29:20.581 --> 29:21.501
from:

29:21.581 --> 29:22.581
Our:

29:22.661 --> 29:23.821
..combines smooth colour

29:23.901 --> 29:25.061
with conditioning balm.

29:25.141 --> 29:26.621
Don't want colour to dry and crack?

29:26.701 --> 29:28.101
Superstay moves with you

29:28.181 --> 29:29.781
through every pout and pucker.

29:29.901 --> 29:32.341
Luminous colour plus comfort
that lasts all day.

29:33.061 --> 29:34.301
..18-hour.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.421
# Maybe it's Maybelline!

29:36.781 --> 29:40.021
Dear Jane. I know you're still
mad at me for taking the job,

29:40.021 --> 29:42.541
but it was my dream job.

29:42.541 --> 29:44.661
Yes, Adam.
You seem to think everything

29:44.661 --> 29:47.181
is just gonna carry on like before.
Isn't it?

29:47.181 --> 29:48.301
You tell me.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.101
I just feel that- (error bleep)

29:52.101 --> 29:54.181
There's nothing more frustrating
than losing connection.

29:54.181 --> 29:58.101
That's why the new BT Home Hub gives

Or call:

30:07.221 --> 30:10.101
# The Entertainer.

30:10.741 --> 30:11.661
OH!...

30:15.781 --> 30:16.941
OH!...(Laughter)

30:19.061 --> 30:20.261
OH!...(Annoyance)

30:23.701 --> 30:24.381
OH!...(Annoyance)

30:27.261 --> 30:28.261
TRAIN WHISTLE.

30:30.141 --> 30:31.341
(In unison:) OH FELIX!

31:38.180 --> 31:40.420
We know you don't
really want to beat the system,

31:40.540 --> 31:41.980
just want it to work.

31:43.660 --> 31:46.980
We know you don't
really enjoy complaining.

31:49.100 --> 31:52.100
We too believe the most important
part of a home

31:52.220 --> 31:54.460
is the people inside.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.940
Make a stand

31:56.060 --> 31:57.540
with AXA's home insurance,

31:57.700 --> 31:59.980
and get your own
dedicated claim handler

32:00.140 --> 32:02.020
if your home
is damaged by water.

33:38.299 --> 33:39.699
Jerry couldn't get rid
of this stuff?

33:39.699 --> 33:40.979
What do you want
to do with it?

33:40.979 --> 33:42.859
Hey, thanks for the crock-pot.
No problem.

33:42.859 --> 33:44.979
Uh, if it's the one with
the blue flowers on the side,

33:44.979 --> 33:46.059
it has a short!

33:46.059 --> 33:47.979
Almost burnt the house down.

33:47.979 --> 33:49.579
Son of a bitch!

33:49.579 --> 33:51.459
What is it?
I made this...

33:51.459 --> 33:53.979
in the third grade.

33:53.979 --> 33:56.419
Yeah, it's milk and cookies.

33:56.419 --> 33:57.699
For Santa.

33:57.699 --> 33:58.859
OK.

33:58.859 --> 33:59.899
Yeah.

33:59.899 --> 34:01.658
My teacher, Miss Durbin,

34:01.658 --> 34:03.458
said that wherever we are,

34:03.458 --> 34:06.298
if we set this out,
Santa would find us.

34:06.298 --> 34:09.098
That's sweet.

34:09.098 --> 34:10.578
Yeah.

34:10.578 --> 34:12.178
My dad didn't think so.

34:12.178 --> 34:13.898
Yeah, he said
Santa wasn't stupid.

34:13.898 --> 34:15.378
He'd know it wasn't real.

34:15.378 --> 34:16.378
That was my dad.

34:16.378 --> 34:18.138
Yeah, but he kept it.

34:18.138 --> 34:20.058
Yeah.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.737
I guess he did.

34:21.737 --> 34:24.418
The anatomy's so distorted.
I can't feel the tracheal rings.

34:24.418 --> 34:26.658
Focus on your landmarks.
Crit's down to 26.

34:26.658 --> 34:29.178
I'm pulling the plug.
Wait! Guidewire.

34:29.178 --> 34:31.257
Systolic's only 68.
Either you have it or not!

34:32.697 --> 34:34.658
I'm in.

34:34.658 --> 34:35.818
Throw me the bag.

34:35.818 --> 34:39.058
20 units of oxytosin
and start the drip.

34:39.058 --> 34:41.618
OK, we've got chest rise.
You can clamp.

34:41.618 --> 34:43.938
COBURN: Done.

34:46.297 --> 34:47.458
Scissors.

34:47.458 --> 34:49.898
Get the carboprost
on board.

34:56.978 --> 34:59.618
Don't ever worry
that you don't do enough

34:59.618 --> 35:01.498
for your patients,
all right?

35:04.858 --> 35:06.258
Lucien, can you stay?
I need the hands.

35:06.258 --> 35:07.698
Yeah.

35:07.698 --> 35:09.658
Uterine tone seems better.

35:09.658 --> 35:11.778
PERRY: BP's coming up.
MARISOL: Nice and pink.

35:11.778 --> 35:13.418
RASGOTRA:
Umbilical line tray.

35:15.458 --> 35:17.338
Wow.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.738
Good luck, Mr Mosely.
(LAUGHS)

35:21.738 --> 35:23.658
It's a little late
for that, isn't it?

35:23.658 --> 35:25.938
I'm sorry they couldn't
extubate Alex today.

35:25.938 --> 35:27.018
Hopefully soon.

35:27.018 --> 35:28.298
I'll keep my fingers crossed.
Thanks.

35:28.298 --> 35:31.018
Copy, er, the discharge summary,
will ya?

35:32.938 --> 35:35.497
I'll be right back.

35:35.497 --> 35:36.937
Hey!

35:36.937 --> 35:38.897
Max?

35:38.897 --> 35:41.337
Hey, Max!

35:41.337 --> 35:43.257
Hey.

35:44.457 --> 35:45.977
I've been looking
for you, man.

35:47.177 --> 35:48.817
You all right?

35:48.817 --> 35:51.337
Yeah, I'm OK.

35:51.337 --> 35:53.537
Jake has a hard time when
it gets cold, though.

35:53.537 --> 35:54.697
Well, come inside.
Warm up a bit.

35:54.697 --> 35:55.777
Jake can come, too.

36:01.537 --> 36:03.017
Let's start
with a cup of coffee.

36:03.017 --> 36:03.937
You want some coffee?

36:05.937 --> 36:07.857
Yeah.

36:07.857 --> 36:11.697
Yeah, coffee's good.

36:19.137 --> 36:20.777
BRENNER: This wasn't
your average C-section.

36:20.777 --> 36:21.937
As long as she's stable,

36:21.937 --> 36:23.257
we have to take her
into custody.

36:23.257 --> 36:25.057
You know, she hasn't
even seen her baby yet.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.937
I mean, give her
a few days...
Look.

36:26.937 --> 36:28.257
We don't like this
either,

36:28.257 --> 36:29.737
separating a mom
from her kid.

36:29.737 --> 36:32.177
But we can't make
an exception here.

36:32.177 --> 36:33.377
Well, why not?

36:33.377 --> 36:34.657
You should be able to spend...
I'm sorry.

36:34.657 --> 36:36.337
We'll see you tomorrow.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.377
I'll show you out.

36:48.617 --> 36:50.417
You got them to leave?

36:50.417 --> 36:52.337
They're coming back
tomorrow.

36:52.337 --> 36:55.177
They're going to transfer you
to a detention facility.

36:55.177 --> 36:58.097
But my baby...

36:58.097 --> 36:59.377
He's doing very well.

36:59.377 --> 37:00.537
He's still
on a ventilator,

37:00.537 --> 37:02.457
but mostly breathing
on his own.

37:02.457 --> 37:05.377
I should call my husband.

37:05.377 --> 37:07.497
I told him
the surgery went well.

37:07.497 --> 37:09.417
And that he'll be able
to take your baby home

37:09.417 --> 37:11.856
in a few weeks.

37:11.856 --> 37:14.656
Immigration won't
get involved in custody.

37:16.656 --> 37:19.536
A mother is supposed
to protect her child.

37:19.536 --> 37:21.856
Keep him safe.
BRENNER: He's in good hands.

37:21.856 --> 37:23.616
We're taking care
of him.

37:23.616 --> 37:24.936
I need to see him.

37:24.936 --> 37:26.816
I need to see my baby.

37:26.816 --> 37:29.016
TAGGART:
Dr Dubenko.

37:29.016 --> 37:30.336
I'm really swamped
right now, Sam.

37:30.336 --> 37:32.296
Yeah, I need you to try
to extubate Alex again.

37:32.296 --> 37:33.896
We will. Tomorrow.
No, today.

37:33.896 --> 37:35.256
Please?
Oh, we talked about this.

37:35.256 --> 37:36.696
First thing in the morning.
I promise.

37:36.696 --> 37:38.136
I've been studying to become
a nurse anaesthetist

37:38.136 --> 37:40.056
and I think there are some
tricks that we can use.

37:40.056 --> 37:41.096
Tricks?
Yeah.

37:41.096 --> 37:42.296
We can give an anxiolytic

37:42.296 --> 37:44.016
before shutting off the
propofol, right?

37:44.016 --> 37:46.576
That may cut the agitation
we see during emergence.

37:46.576 --> 37:48.376
Two of versed would
be calming

37:48.376 --> 37:49.976
and not too sedating.
OK.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.216
OK, then we sit him up

37:51.216 --> 37:52.976
and we give him something
familiar to focus on.

37:52.976 --> 37:54.856
It's a Blackhawks' game
from last night.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.536
OK.

37:56.536 --> 37:58.536
Well, what if it
doesn't work?

37:58.536 --> 38:00.376
No, it'll work.

38:00.376 --> 38:02.496
I will talk him through it.
I will stay there all night.

38:02.496 --> 38:04.336
I will make sure he uses
the incentive spirometer.

38:04.336 --> 38:06.456
Whatever it takes.

38:09.736 --> 38:11.816
He's so little.

38:11.816 --> 38:15.216
We'll, er, do an MRI
to figure out exactly

38:15.216 --> 38:18.056
what we need to do
to remove the tumour.

38:18.056 --> 38:20.896
Hola, mi hijo.

38:20.896 --> 38:23.976
Had you two picked
names out?

38:23.976 --> 38:26.976
For a boy,
we liked Pablo.

38:28.216 --> 38:30.136
After my grandfather.

38:30.136 --> 38:32.816
He was a strong man.

38:32.816 --> 38:34.856
That's perfect.

38:35.896 --> 38:38.536
How long will he be here?

38:39.576 --> 38:41.816
Well, if all goes well,

38:41.816 --> 38:43.296
only a few weeks.

38:43.296 --> 38:45.096
We're pretty sure
he won't need chemotherapy

38:45.096 --> 38:46.975
or radiation.

38:48.135 --> 38:50.055
All alone.

38:50.055 --> 38:52.135
Hola, Pablo.

38:53.135 --> 38:55.295
Soy tu mami.

38:55.295 --> 38:58.255
No estare aqui, pero..

38:58.255 --> 39:01.175
entonces regresare.

39:01.175 --> 39:03.095
I'll come back.

39:12.215 --> 39:14.095
They took a risk
staying here.
So what?

39:14.095 --> 39:15.415
It's still inhumane
to separate them.

39:15.415 --> 39:17.615
Yeah, but there is nothing
that we can do, is there?

39:17.615 --> 39:19.575
Not right now.

39:19.575 --> 39:21.375
It's not a good time
to rock the boat.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.735
Why, because you're
at the centre

39:22.735 --> 39:24.255
of a malpractice suit?

39:24.255 --> 39:25.975
Something like that, yeah.

39:27.015 --> 39:28.695
I could've sworn

39:28.695 --> 39:30.855
that Neela Rasgotra
was a boat-rocker.

39:30.855 --> 39:34.055
Like a champion-grade,
professional one at that.

39:34.055 --> 39:36.215
But I guess - I don't know -
I was, I was wrong.

39:36.215 --> 39:38.335
No, you're not wrong, but...

39:38.335 --> 39:39.095
What?

39:39.095 --> 39:41.335
I just don't want to take

39:41.335 --> 39:43.055
any unnecessary chances
with my career.

39:43.055 --> 39:45.815
Ah.

39:45.815 --> 39:48.615
Good things happen
when you take a chance.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.935
You ready?

40:00.935 --> 40:04.935
OK, kiddo, I'm gonna
take that tube out now. OK?

40:04.935 --> 40:06.135
I know you can do this.

40:06.135 --> 40:07.935
Try, try again, remember?

40:07.935 --> 40:09.895
Like when we took the
training wheels off your bike.

40:09.895 --> 40:11.575
The first time
you fell off,

40:11.575 --> 40:14.015
but then you got right back on
and you rode like the wind.

40:14.015 --> 40:15.015
Remember that?

40:15.015 --> 40:16.815
WHISPERING:
OK, balloon's down.

40:19.495 --> 40:23.174
Relax and take some deep breaths,
OK? Second time's the charm.

40:23.174 --> 40:25.894
You want to do the honours?

40:25.894 --> 40:26.974
Me?

40:26.974 --> 40:29.454
Yeah, you know
what you're doing.

40:31.974 --> 40:34.494
Yeah, OK.

40:34.494 --> 40:37.734
All right, you ready?
Here we go.

40:37.734 --> 40:39.694
WHISPERING: Come on.

40:41.734 --> 40:44.014
(COUGHS)
Yankauer.

40:44.014 --> 40:46.854
(INHALES, EXHALES)

40:49.774 --> 40:52.814
Give it a moment.

40:52.814 --> 40:53.774
Alex?

40:56.494 --> 40:58.014
Hey, Alex.

41:00.014 --> 41:03.654
Hey, sweetie,
how you feeling?

41:03.654 --> 41:04.574
Did I...

41:06.414 --> 41:08.854
Did I miss Christmas?

41:12.974 --> 41:14.934
No.

42:33.733 --> 42:35.413
Just listen to that...
BIRDSONG

42:35.533 --> 42:37.253
The wonderful sound of...
GUNSHOTS

42:37.373 --> 42:39.093
- See that?
- ..the upper classes.

42:39.173 --> 42:41.733
If you're really posh, you fly in.

42:41.853 --> 42:44.373
And, unlike the poor old birds,
you get to fly out again.

42:44.453 --> 42:46.573
If you want to fit in here...

42:46.653 --> 42:48.293
it helps if you talk posh

42:48.373 --> 42:49.493
or speak Latin.

42:49.613 --> 42:51.693
But you don't have to be posh
to be privileged.

42:51.773 --> 42:53.093
HORN HONKS

42:53.253 --> 42:55.013
If you have four years'
no-claims discount...

42:58.213 --> 42:59.133
..if
they can't.

42:59.253 --> 43:00.293
Afternoon,
George.

43:00.373 --> 43:02.253
Call now or visit:

43:03.693 --> 43:05.733
When will your headache go away?

43:05.853 --> 43:07.853
That may depend on
what's in your stomach.

43:07.973 --> 43:11.733
Because ordinary paracetamol tablets
may sit there for up to an hour.

43:14.013 --> 43:16.613
New Panadol Advance tablets
with Optizorb

43:16.693 --> 43:18.293
are a smart choice.

43:18.413 --> 43:19.693
They break up
in the stomach

43:19.813 --> 43:21.213
up to 5 times
faster,

43:21.333 --> 43:22.653
which means
they can get to work

43:22.773 --> 43:24.213
at least
30% faster

43:24.293 --> 43:26.493
than ordinary paracetamol tablets

43:26.573 --> 43:28.333
and are easy on the stomach.

43:28.893 --> 43:30.093
New Panadol Advance

43:30.213 --> 43:31.133
with
Optizorb.

44:05.612 --> 44:07.492
# She's pure as New York snow

44:09.372 --> 44:11.772
# She got Bette Davis eyes
Nice 'n Easy transforms your hair

44:11.772 --> 44:14.852
with a salon inspired blend
of subtle tones

44:14.852 --> 44:16.492
For beautiful, natural looking
hair colour

44:16.492 --> 44:18.612
It's a small change to your hair

44:18.612 --> 44:21.252
that makes a big change to your head.
Nice 'n Easy

44:53.692 --> 44:55.252
The new smart diesel

44:55.372 --> 44:58.292
is the most fuel-efficient
production car in the UK.

45:00.612 --> 45:03.492
At 85.6 miles per gallon combined,

45:05.332 --> 45:08.652
you'll be surprised how long
you've got between refills.

45:10.011 --> 45:11.371
Think smart.

45:43.691 --> 45:46.691
Hey. Jake's in the break
room eating pot roast

45:46.691 --> 45:48.651
courtesy of our
clerk Frank's wife.

45:48.651 --> 45:51.731
I'm not sure who's happier -
Jake or frank.

45:51.731 --> 45:53.931
Yeah. Thanks.

45:58.491 --> 46:02.611
After I got back,
nothing went right.

46:04.651 --> 46:09.091
Those people who used to care
were gone, or I scared them off.

46:09.091 --> 46:12.011
Or the ones I thought I could
rely on from the army said

46:12.011 --> 46:13.171
I wasn't
their problem any more.

46:13.171 --> 46:15.251
Then you came along

46:15.251 --> 46:17.611
and I figured you were
more of the same.

46:18.651 --> 46:21.171
But these past few days,

46:21.171 --> 46:24.131
I heard you were looking
for me.

46:24.131 --> 46:25.411
I saw the fliers.

46:25.411 --> 46:28.131
I was worried about you.

46:28.131 --> 46:31.171
That means something,
you know.

46:31.171 --> 46:33.651
That makes
a difference.

46:35.691 --> 46:39.651
I don't, I don't want
to die on the streets.

46:40.691 --> 46:42.291
BANFIELD:
Oncology says

46:42.291 --> 46:44.531
if we do nothing, she has
a couple of months, tops.

46:44.531 --> 46:45.730
The best thing we can do

46:45.730 --> 46:47.330
is urge her
to spend the time well.

46:47.330 --> 46:48.650
She has
a six-month-old child.

46:48.650 --> 46:50.770
All the more reason for her
to enjoy the time she has left.

46:50.770 --> 46:53.410
Look, if I take her to the OR,
there's a very good chance

46:53.410 --> 46:56.090
that I'll cut into that thing
and she'll bleed to death.

46:56.090 --> 46:59.610
Or you could debulk it and
give her more time.
Slim chance, slim chance.

46:59.610 --> 47:03.010
They've only had three
years together...
I know this isn't what you wanted.

47:03.010 --> 47:05.610
You could give Renee time
to create real memories...

47:05.610 --> 47:09.410
Christmas really brings out
the tenacity in you ER people.
Doesn't it? Doesn't it?

47:09.410 --> 47:11.090
(SIGHS)

47:12.450 --> 47:15.370
Fine, make her NPO
after midnight.

47:15.370 --> 47:17.890
I'll try to get her on
the schedule for the morning.

47:21.810 --> 47:23.690
Hey, I heard the good news.

47:23.690 --> 47:25.010
How you feeling?

47:25.010 --> 47:26.730
I'm all right.

47:26.730 --> 47:28.050
You don't
have to talk.

47:28.050 --> 47:29.770
I brought you some entertainment.

47:29.770 --> 47:32.330
There's enough movies
in here to tide you over

47:32.330 --> 47:33.970
until you
go home.
Thanks.

47:33.970 --> 47:35.770
All right, I'm
going to run out

47:35.770 --> 47:37.970
and get you that ice cream
you've been craving.

47:37.970 --> 47:39.170
Rocky road?

47:39.170 --> 47:41.050
Cookie dough.

47:43.010 --> 47:45.170
Ice cream for dinner,
huh, big shot?

47:45.170 --> 47:46.690
Not bad.

47:46.690 --> 47:48.650
Sarah wanted to be here,

47:48.650 --> 47:50.650
but she, er...she's
at her grandparents.

47:50.650 --> 47:52.130
Although she
did send this...

47:52.130 --> 47:54.210
tiny little card.

47:54.210 --> 47:56.290
How is she?

47:56.290 --> 47:57.930
She's good.

47:57.930 --> 47:59.770
Said her arms itches
from the cast.

48:03.730 --> 48:07.210
I thought I was doing the right
thing, you know. I didn't... I...

48:07.210 --> 48:08.570
No, Alex, this
wasn't your fault.

48:08.570 --> 48:11.970
I should have never let you
and Sarah go out that night.

48:11.970 --> 48:14.370
No, you were being cool.

48:14.370 --> 48:16.290
Well...

48:16.290 --> 48:18.330
Yeah.

48:18.330 --> 48:20.889
That was the problem.

48:20.889 --> 48:23.129
Here's your half.

48:23.129 --> 48:24.929
Three dollars and
a Canadian quarter?

48:24.929 --> 48:26.689
Ah, most of my customers
were patients.

48:26.689 --> 48:29.409
I mean, come on, I'm not
going to charge some kid

48:29.409 --> 48:30.609
with the chicken pox

48:30.609 --> 48:32.609
for his first ever
pair of roller blades.

48:32.609 --> 48:33.889
There were roller blades
in there?

48:33.889 --> 48:36.489
Don't worry... I saved
the best for last.

48:38.809 --> 48:41.289
You know what that is,
don't you?

48:41.289 --> 48:44.529
A really old motorcycle?

48:44.529 --> 48:46.649
It's a 1966 Triumph.

48:46.649 --> 48:49.689
Marlon Brando rode
a Triumph in The Wild One.

48:49.689 --> 48:51.289
Never saw it, don't care.

48:51.289 --> 48:53.689
Oh! It's only
the greatest rebel movie ever

48:53.689 --> 48:55.129
with the most awesomest bike.

48:55.129 --> 48:57.929
You know what? If you love it
so much, keep it.

48:57.929 --> 49:00.769
What? No, no, I-I can't...
I can't take this.

49:00.769 --> 49:02.249
Fix it up,
sell it, whatever.

49:02.249 --> 49:03.849
I don't...
I don't get you.

49:03.849 --> 49:05.329
All the great
stuff in there,

49:05.329 --> 49:07.329
and there was nothing
in there you wanted?

49:07.329 --> 49:10.369
No. It's just...
It's just stuff.

49:10.369 --> 49:12.929
Anyway, thanks for
taking care of this.

49:12.929 --> 49:15.009
I'm sure you had
something better to do.

49:15.009 --> 49:16.809
Actually, I didn't.

49:16.809 --> 49:19.049
Since I moved back,

49:19.049 --> 49:22.289
work's been
tough to come by.

49:22.289 --> 49:25.649
Oh. I'm sorry, man.
Anything I can do?

49:26.769 --> 49:29.369
How can I get
my old job back?

49:32.969 --> 49:35.529
Fell asleep
five minutes ago.

49:35.529 --> 49:37.969
Hmm. The extubation
must have worn him out.

49:37.969 --> 49:39.289
Yeah.

49:39.289 --> 49:40.689
I'll put this
in the freezer.

49:40.689 --> 49:42.929
Oh. He seems like
his old self again, you know?

49:42.929 --> 49:45.849
He wanted me to remind you that
he wants a PS3 for Christmas.

49:45.849 --> 49:47.849
Lucien said he could
be out in a week.

49:47.849 --> 49:50.569
Yeah. We should have a party
for him when he comes home.

49:50.569 --> 49:53.369
Oh, you know what? I forgot
to tell you the other good news.

49:53.369 --> 49:55.089
Max showed up.
Can you believe that?
Oh, yeah?

49:55.089 --> 49:57.488
Yeah, I got him admitted,
and don't get mad, but I said

49:57.488 --> 49:59.888
that we could watch his dog
while he was in the hospital.

49:59.888 --> 50:01.848
Tony...
I know, I know,
but you know what?

50:01.848 --> 50:04.048
Alex always wanted a dog,
and so I thought it'd be cool,

50:04.048 --> 50:06.528
like, when he gets out, a dog
would be there at the house.

50:06.528 --> 50:09.488
Tony, listen. Uh...

50:10.648 --> 50:14.488
I'm going to stay at Chuny's...
for a while...

50:14.488 --> 50:16.928
until, er...

50:16.928 --> 50:19.328
until I can find a new place
for me and Alex.

50:20.368 --> 50:22.648
You're moving out?

50:22.648 --> 50:25.328
It's just...
It's just not working.

50:25.328 --> 50:27.528
Sam, I know... I know
this has been rough,

50:27.528 --> 50:29.568
but it'll get better.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.128
We were doing fine before.

50:31.128 --> 50:33.488
What, you just think
things can go back to normal?

50:33.488 --> 50:34.648
I-I made a mistake.

50:34.648 --> 50:36.248
I shouldn't have
let them go out...

50:36.248 --> 50:37.848
Yeah, I know.
You keep saying that,

50:37.848 --> 50:39.568
but it doesn't
make me feel better.

50:39.568 --> 50:41.608
Well, I don't know
what else to tell you!

50:41.608 --> 50:43.448
Sam?

50:46.368 --> 50:47.688
We can work past this.

50:49.808 --> 50:52.248
I can't.

50:54.008 --> 50:55.888
I can't.

50:57.048 --> 50:58.888
So you're just
going to run away?

50:58.888 --> 51:00.808
I'm not running away.

51:02.888 --> 51:04.808
I'm just telling you...

51:04.808 --> 51:06.968
it's over.

51:23.448 --> 51:25.008
How's it look?

51:25.008 --> 51:27.448
It's like locusts
got to this.

51:29.288 --> 51:31.088
Oh, hey.
How was the hot date?

51:31.088 --> 51:33.167
Oh, he was a douche.

51:33.167 --> 51:35.047
You know, who lies
about their age?

51:35.047 --> 51:37.967
First he was 34,
then he was 37, now he's 42.

51:37.967 --> 51:40.367
Maybe he was afraid
you wouldn't date a 42-year-old.

51:40.367 --> 51:41.647
Well, of course
I wouldn't.

51:41.647 --> 51:43.007
And, besides,
he was a stockbroker,

51:43.007 --> 51:45.327
so it's been a bad year
for him anyway.

51:45.327 --> 51:48.727
Bummer. This has been fun.
I'm gonna get a drink.
I'm gonna get more food.

51:51.687 --> 51:53.527
She hired you on the spot?

51:53.527 --> 51:55.927
Yeah. She wanted a Santa
who wasn't stoned.

51:59.367 --> 52:00.807
Wow. You think
you know someone.

52:00.807 --> 52:03.607
Ho, ho, ho, Dr Banfield.

52:04.887 --> 52:06.927
And who might
this young fellow be?

52:06.927 --> 52:08.687
Russell Banfield,
the husband.

52:08.687 --> 52:09.887
Ho, ho, ho.

52:09.887 --> 52:12.167
This is Jerry.
He's filling in for Frank.

52:12.167 --> 52:13.887
You can call me Kringle,
Kris Kringle.

52:13.887 --> 52:15.207
Mr Kringle.

52:15.207 --> 52:17.727
And this is Dr Morris.

52:17.727 --> 52:20.087
So, you must be the guy
that slept with my wife.

52:20.087 --> 52:22.287
What?! No, no, no, no.
Just kidding.

52:22.287 --> 52:23.487
(LAUGHS)

52:23.487 --> 52:24.607
Nice to meet you.

52:24.607 --> 52:27.207
Ho, ho. Jerry.
Yes? Er, Santa. Yes?

52:27.207 --> 52:30.247
Listen, I need you to do me
a favour. All right, now...

52:30.247 --> 52:31.607
Don't worry.
It's a virgin.

52:31.607 --> 52:33.847
I'll be ready for Renee's
surgery in the morning.

52:35.007 --> 52:36.287
Hey.

52:36.287 --> 52:37.567
Hey.

52:37.567 --> 52:40.167
We got news on the Bertha
Mendenhall malpractice suit.

52:40.167 --> 52:41.487
What is it?

52:41.487 --> 52:43.447
Well, I don't know
if I should tell you.

52:43.447 --> 52:45.127
Well, is it bad?

52:45.127 --> 52:46.127
It's bad.

52:46.127 --> 52:47.407
Depends on whose side
you were on.

52:47.407 --> 52:49.007
Just spill it, OK?

52:49.007 --> 52:51.647
Motion for summary judgment.

52:53.127 --> 52:55.607
The judge threw the case out.
You're kidding.

52:55.607 --> 52:57.607
Merry Christmas, Neela.

52:58.487 --> 53:00.007
Gloria left?

53:00.007 --> 53:02.007
Oh, yeah.

53:02.007 --> 53:03.527
Looks that way.

53:03.527 --> 53:06.367
And you're not upset?

53:06.367 --> 53:10.166
Well, people do crazy things
when they're desperate. Eggnog?

53:10.166 --> 53:13.566
Well, wait. You're not even
the slightest bit worried?

53:13.566 --> 53:16.606
She'll be OK. I'm starving.

53:16.606 --> 53:18.206
What's going on?

53:18.206 --> 53:20.566
Nothing.

53:20.566 --> 53:22.206
It's nothing.

53:22.206 --> 53:42.806
Wait - your patient
leaves hours after surgery,

53:42.806 --> 53:44.126
And it's also possible

53:44.126 --> 53:46.486
that someone wrote down
a few instructions.

53:53.566 --> 53:55.766
Neela Rasgotra,
rocking the boat.

54:01.326 --> 54:05.006
Archie! ..Will you just
hold this? I'll be right back.

54:05.006 --> 54:06.966
Hey! Where are you going?

54:06.966 --> 54:08.886
Archie Morris never leaves
a party early.

54:08.886 --> 54:10.406
In fact, more
often than not,

54:10.406 --> 54:11.686
he's the last
man standing.

54:11.686 --> 54:13.686
Well, there's a first time
for everything, right?

54:13.686 --> 54:16.246
Oh, come on. Who's going
to pinch my butt later? Frank?

54:16.246 --> 54:17.406
He's far too stoned.

54:17.406 --> 54:19.366
Not in the party mood,
I guess.

54:19.366 --> 54:21.486
Well, we can change that.

54:21.486 --> 54:23.006
You're like Happy
Holly over here.

54:23.006 --> 54:25.166
I should be asking
if you're OK.

54:25.166 --> 54:28.326
I'm just saying, there are
always things to celebrate.

54:28.326 --> 54:29.806
Come with me.

54:33.566 --> 54:35.766
It's pretty amazing, huh?

54:35.766 --> 54:38.446
Some days, our job
really does matter.

54:40.126 --> 54:41.326
Today I did paperwork

54:41.326 --> 54:44.085
and saw my childhood
parade around the ER.

54:44.085 --> 54:45.485
Oh, yeah, Jerry gave me

54:45.485 --> 54:47.565
the Burl Ives Christmas
Favourites on reel-to-reel.

54:47.565 --> 54:50.245
Oh, OK.

54:50.245 --> 54:53.285
I kept acting
like I didn't care.

54:53.285 --> 54:55.805
But, you know,
I'd be lying

54:55.805 --> 54:58.125
if I said there
wasn't a part of me

54:58.125 --> 55:00.165
that hoped Jerry might
find something that would,

55:00.165 --> 55:02.765
I don't know, help me
understand my dad.

55:04.805 --> 55:07.685
Something more than
crock pots and cheese hats.

55:12.685 --> 55:16.685
MUSIC PLAYING

55:25.245 --> 55:27.405
So I was thinking...

55:27.405 --> 55:30.205
about us having a family.

55:33.085 --> 55:34.965
Starting again.

55:37.005 --> 55:40.165
That's a pretty big
leap of faith.

55:42.165 --> 55:45.525
Not so hard when you got
someone to hold onto.

58:47.043 --> 58:47.683
Talk
to me!

58:47.763 --> 58:49.483
Superstay 18-hour lipcolour

58:49.563 --> 58:50.483
from:

58:50.563 --> 58:51.563
Our:

58:51.643 --> 58:52.803
..combines smooth colour

58:52.883 --> 58:54.043
with conditioning balm.

58:54.123 --> 58:55.603
Don't want colour to dry and crack?

58:55.683 --> 58:57.083
Superstay moves with you

58:57.163 --> 58:58.763
through every pout and pucker.

58:58.883 --> 59:01.323
Luminous colour plus comfort
that lasts all day.

59:02.043 --> 59:03.283
..18-hour.

59:03.363 --> 59:04.403
# Maybe it's Maybelline!

59:05.803 --> 59:09.003
Often... the best part of a meal
is the dessert.

59:09.563 --> 59:11.123
But sometimes everything adds up

59:11.243 --> 59:13.083
and after busy days

59:13.243 --> 59:15.963
you can just feel sluggish
or a bit bloated.

59:16.523 --> 59:18.203
Now there's something new.

59:18.323 --> 59:20.123
Activia Intensely Creamy.

59:20.803 --> 59:22.723
It's a deliciously
thick, creamy yogurt

59:22.883 --> 59:23.963
and because
it's from Activia

59:24.123 --> 59:25.723
it actually helps
your digestive health

59:25.843 --> 59:27.163
by improving transit.

59:27.283 --> 59:28.883
Mm... Works for me.

59:31.642 --> 59:33.562
A delicious new dessert
from Activia.

59:33.682 --> 59:34.362
# Mm... Danone!

59:35.682 --> 59:36.402
Right now,

59:36.482 --> 59:37.562
at Direct Line Car Insurance,

59:37.642 --> 59:38.762
you get 12 months' cover

59:38.842 --> 59:39.562
for the price of 10.

59:39.682 --> 59:41.762
Plus, you get vandalism cover that
preserves

59:41.882 --> 59:43.162
your no-claims
discount.

59:43.282 --> 59:44.362
# CAVALRY CHARGE
Smashing!

01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:19.881
Oh, hi.
Yes, I was calling
about the crib...

01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:22.201
Yeah, this is Kevin Walker from
Senator McCallister's office.

01:01:22.201 --> 01:01:23.721
..the bed conversion kit.
Yes. Kevin walker.

01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:25.761
Yeah, I was wondering if maybe
you had that in cherry. Yes.

01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:27.481
Yes. Thank you.
Can you keep it down, please?

01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:29.681
Sorry, Kevin, but this is
my home, not your office.

01:01:29.681 --> 01:01:31.241
OK, thank you.
You're gonna meet with

01:01:31.241 --> 01:01:32.801
the Commercial Fishermen's Union
today at 4:00 pm.

01:01:32.801 --> 01:01:34.281
You'll be talking to them
about your opposition

01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:35.801
to offshore drilling.
That's a good one.

01:01:35.801 --> 01:01:37.761
Oh, look.
Why won't you listen to me?

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:39.601
It won't have an impact for years,

01:01:39.601 --> 01:01:41.601
and the environmental risks
aren't worth it.

01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:43.761
Kevin, he's not listening.
Don't you see he's online?

01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:47.721
Don't you have a baby carriage
or something to buy?
It's a crib, and I'm on hold.

01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:50.401
Look, I-I just got
a link online from my son.

01:01:50.401 --> 01:01:52.641
He wants me to take him
to the Thanksgiving Day parade.

01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:55.721
Your kids are coming
to Thanksgiving? That's great.
Mom's gonna love that.

01:01:57.441 --> 01:01:58.841
Um...
