WEBVTT

00:00.981 --> 00:02.062
Previously on "Castle"...

00:02.082 --> 00:04.029
I can't prove it,
but my gut says

00:04.049 --> 00:05.564
this is Kelly Nieman's work.

00:05.585 --> 00:07.953
Beckett: Last time, she got away with
it because she had an accomplice.

00:07.987 --> 00:10.288
Oh, my God. That's Jerry Tyson.

00:10.322 --> 00:12.558
3XK... he's alive.

00:12.592 --> 00:14.528
Nieman and Tyson
are in this together.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.062
Except Jerry Tyson is dead.
Therefore, that can't be him.

00:17.096 --> 00:18.464
I'm Michael Boudreau.

00:18.484 --> 00:21.366
You had cosmetic surgery
to look like a serial killer.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.701
So here we are, not being able
to prove that Tyson is Tyson

00:23.735 --> 00:25.937
because we don't have
his DNA sample that he stole.

00:25.971 --> 00:27.738
Ryan: Tyson's latest girlfriend,
Amy Barrett.

00:27.773 --> 00:29.774
Question is, where is she now?
What did Tyson do to her?

00:29.808 --> 00:30.942
[Cellphone rings] Beckett.

00:30.976 --> 00:32.634
It's Amy Barrett. I'm afraid.

00:32.654 --> 00:34.979
Don't move. I'll be there, okay?

00:35.013 --> 00:37.748
Gates: Unless we can show that he's
Tyson, we have to release him.

00:37.783 --> 00:39.216
Castle: He wanted to be here,
and so did she.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.487
Esposito: Why?

00:40.652 --> 00:41.786
Aah!

00:41.820 --> 00:42.954
Beckett.

00:42.988 --> 00:44.678
Voice: [Distorted] It's done.

00:45.924 --> 00:47.925
[Sirens wail, tires screech]

00:47.960 --> 00:49.960
You sure this is where
she said she was going?

00:49.994 --> 00:51.261
Yeah, yeah... 9th and Jane.

00:51.296 --> 00:54.565
Ryan: Tory said she still can't
get a trace on Beckett's phone.

00:54.599 --> 00:57.067
Says it's either been
turned off or disabled.

00:59.604 --> 01:01.871
There. There's her car.

01:08.879 --> 01:09.980
"Help her!"

01:12.549 --> 01:14.350
They want us to know
they have her.

01:14.384 --> 01:15.719
All right,
let's get CSU down here!

01:15.753 --> 01:18.855
Esposito: Call in a 10-45! I want
every available unit canvassing!

01:18.889 --> 01:19.756
Ask everyone questions!

01:19.790 --> 01:21.457
Somebody had to have seen her!
Let's go!

01:21.492 --> 01:22.458
We're gonna dig into

01:22.493 --> 01:24.193
all the security and traffic
cams in the area...

01:24.228 --> 01:26.996
any ATMs, businesses, anything
with eyes on the streets.

01:27.030 --> 01:28.164
Go, go, go!

01:28.198 --> 01:29.499
Castle?

01:29.533 --> 01:30.533
It's him.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.468
Boudreau, Tyson,
whatever he's calling himself -

01:32.503 --> 01:34.036
it's him, and it's Nieman.

01:34.070 --> 01:35.338
But they were
in the precinct with us.

01:35.372 --> 01:37.039
Giving them the perfect alibi.

01:37.073 --> 01:39.775
Meanwhile, they use Amy Barrett
as bait to draw Beckett out.

01:39.809 --> 01:40.943
You think Barrett
was involved with this?

01:40.977 --> 01:42.044
Or she's a victim, too.

01:42.078 --> 01:46.015
We need to find Nieman,
and we need to find Boudreau.

01:46.049 --> 01:47.883
[Pounding on door]

01:47.917 --> 01:49.952
Ryan: Mr. Boudreau, open up!

01:50.820 --> 01:52.320
Mr. Boudreau,
shortly after leaving

01:52.355 --> 01:54.023
to meet with your friend
Amy Barrett,

01:54.057 --> 01:55.390
one of our detectives
went missing.

01:55.424 --> 01:56.525
So?

01:56.559 --> 01:58.393
- So, where is she?
- I don't know.

01:58.427 --> 02:01.029
I've been in police custody
until an hour ago.

02:01.063 --> 02:02.664
Giving you the perfect alibi.

02:02.698 --> 02:05.532
Maybe I have an alibi 'cause
I didn't do anything wrong.

02:06.106 --> 02:09.007
Then why don't you let us in?

02:14.076 --> 02:15.376
Fine.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.013
Beckett?

02:19.048 --> 02:19.947
Beckett?!

02:19.982 --> 02:23.084
Come on, man. Nobody's here.
It's just me.

02:23.118 --> 02:24.585
What'd you do to her?
Huh, Tyson?

02:24.619 --> 02:25.753
Where are you keeping her?

02:25.788 --> 02:27.921
I'm not keeping her anywhere,
and I'm not Jerry Tyson.

02:27.955 --> 02:29.890
No, no! Come on!
You can't do this.

02:29.924 --> 02:32.025
You can't just come in here threatening me.
I know it's you!

02:32.060 --> 02:33.227
I know it's you.

02:33.261 --> 02:34.161
[Door slams]

02:34.196 --> 02:37.364
You're not helping her...
not like that.

02:37.399 --> 02:39.266
So what?
We just let him kill her?

02:39.301 --> 02:41.068
No. But, Castle,
we can't do anything

02:41.102 --> 02:42.069
if we don't have anything.

02:42.103 --> 02:45.505
It's him, Kevin. It's Tyson.

02:45.539 --> 02:47.507
We need to prove it.

02:47.541 --> 02:50.110
We'll put units on him,
put him under the microscope.

02:50.144 --> 02:51.277
If it's him,

02:51.312 --> 02:54.948
he won't be able to make a move
without us knowing it.

02:54.982 --> 02:56.817
We'll find her.

03:00.154 --> 03:01.120
[Sighs]

03:01.154 --> 03:02.922
[Police radio chatter]

03:02.956 --> 03:05.958
[Scoffs] Okay, look all you
want, Detective Esposito,

03:05.992 --> 03:08.194
she's not here,
and I have no idea where she is.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.929
What about your client
Amy Barrett?

03:09.963 --> 03:12.031
My office gave you
our information on Amy Barrett.

03:12.065 --> 03:14.234
I can't help it if her contact
information is out of date.

03:14.268 --> 03:16.569
Yeah, I bet you can't... just
like you have nothing to do with

03:16.604 --> 03:17.970
Detective Beckett's disappearance.

03:18.004 --> 03:20.572
You seem to think
that I'm something that I'm not.

03:20.607 --> 03:24.443
And how could I be involved?
I was with you at the time.

03:25.445 --> 03:26.979
Ryan: I got a unit
on Boudreau's place

03:27.013 --> 03:28.313
and a follow car standing by.

03:28.348 --> 03:30.616
Espo, put units on Nieman,
as well.

03:30.650 --> 03:31.817
Anything on the canvass?

03:31.852 --> 03:34.253
We've pulled officers from the
3rd and 8th precincts to help.

03:34.287 --> 03:36.054
If there's a witness out there,
we'll find them.

03:36.088 --> 03:36.988
How about video?

03:37.022 --> 03:38.790
The immediate area
where you found her car

03:38.824 --> 03:40.559
didn't have any street-cam
or security coverage.

03:40.593 --> 03:42.227
Making it the perfect place
for an abduction.

03:42.262 --> 03:44.296
I have teams from four precincts
pulling all video

03:44.330 --> 03:46.431
in a 10-block radius
from where Beckett was taken.

03:46.466 --> 03:47.633
It's a long shot, but...

03:47.667 --> 03:48.433
What about Amy Barrett...

03:48.468 --> 03:50.068
the phone call
she made to Beckett?

03:50.102 --> 03:51.102
Can we trace that?

03:51.137 --> 03:53.104
We did... to a cellphone.
It's no longer active.

03:53.139 --> 03:55.006
But we've got Amy's picture out
to every cop

03:55.040 --> 03:56.841
and every transit worker
in the city.

03:56.876 --> 03:58.777
Amy's not gonna be in public...
not if she's working with Tyson.

03:58.811 --> 04:02.147
Gates: And we're assuming
Boudreau is Tyson.

04:02.181 --> 04:07.752
But what if Mike Boudreau
is really Mike Boudreau?

04:07.786 --> 04:10.087
What if Nieman actually cut him
to look like Tyson

04:10.121 --> 04:11.989
just to give us
someone to chase?

04:12.023 --> 04:17.127
What if the real Jerry Tyson
is still out there?

04:17.161 --> 04:18.696
No.

04:18.730 --> 04:20.363
He's just messing
with our heads.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.366
Boudreau is Tyson.

04:22.401 --> 04:24.802
It doesn't make any sense.

04:24.836 --> 04:26.804
Why would he let himself
get arrested?

04:26.838 --> 04:29.986
Why would he risk
returning to his apartment?

04:31.176 --> 04:33.197
It's part of the thrill.

04:34.578 --> 04:39.166
To be here...
among us, within our grasp.

04:39.430 --> 04:42.452
He wants to see how close
he can get to the flame.

04:42.486 --> 04:44.354
That's what excites him.

04:44.388 --> 04:47.527
It's not just the murder
he likes... it's the game.

04:47.853 --> 04:49.626
We had him,
and we let our guard down.

04:49.660 --> 04:51.294
That was his plan.

04:51.329 --> 04:52.629
[Cellphone vibrates]

04:52.663 --> 04:53.896
[Cellphone beeps] Hello?

05:17.287 --> 05:18.588
It sounded like
she was, uh, struggling.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.723
She was trying to get away from someone.
She could still be there.

- Yeah.

06:36.498 --> 06:37.631
I don't understand.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.400
If this is a recording, when did
they get her to say this?

06:40.435 --> 06:42.503
They didn't...
the recording was manufactured,

06:42.537 --> 06:44.404
digitally spliced
from what appear to be

06:44.439 --> 06:45.705
- several different sources.
- What sources?

06:45.740 --> 06:46.840
This, for one.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.241
It's an interview Beckett gave

06:48.275 --> 06:50.476
to the local news
just after you disappeared.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.746
Beckett: Please,if you have any information

06:52.780 --> 06:55.048
or know anything
about the disappearance

06:55.082 --> 06:57.684
of Richard Castle,
I need your help.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.252
And here's the recording.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.687
Castle, can you hear me?

07:00.721 --> 07:03.656
Please, Castle,
I need your help.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.924
Given the background noise
on some of these other words,

07:05.959 --> 07:08.194
I'm guessing parts of this
were recorded in public

07:08.228 --> 07:10.029
using a parabolic mike
on the street,

07:10.063 --> 07:11.164
maybe even at crime scenes.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.866
This was planned. They've been
preparing this for months.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.100
Looks that way.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.269
This was about Beckett.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.003
No.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.572
That interview,
that was meant as a...

07:20.606 --> 07:21.774
as a message to me.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.442
He wants me to suffer.

07:24.477 --> 07:25.847
Why?

07:26.265 --> 07:29.114
Why is Tyson fixated on you?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.977
If he's directing this at you,
he may try to communicate.

07:31.997 --> 07:34.553
We should put a tap and a trace
on all your phones.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.587
Tori: I'll set it up.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.156
Captain,
he's already communicating.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.158
He's out there,
sitting in Boudreau's apartment.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.426
And he knows where she is.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.761
And we can't touch him
until we have proof.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.730
By then, she'll be dead!

07:45.764 --> 07:47.914
Please, captain. This is...
she's my wife.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.735
Mr. Castle, I know
you're hurting. We all are.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.504
But we have to keep our wits
about us.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.339
We have to work the evidence.

07:54.373 --> 07:56.408
It's the only way
we can get her back.

07:56.442 --> 07:57.241
Esposito: Captain.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.043
The canvass
at the abduction site

07:59.077 --> 08:00.845
found a witness
who said that she saw someone

08:00.879 --> 08:02.113
matching Beckett's description.

08:02.147 --> 08:04.982
Said she was in a wheelchair
being pushed towards a red van,

08:05.017 --> 08:08.519
and, uh, the witness also said
she appeared unconscious.

08:08.553 --> 08:10.021
She must've been drugged.

08:10.055 --> 08:11.222
Did they see who was with her?

08:11.256 --> 08:13.691
No. The person pushing the
wheelchair was wearing a hoodie.

08:13.725 --> 08:15.559
Well, what about
a license plate?

08:15.593 --> 08:16.660
No.

08:23.456 --> 08:25.469
We are gonna get her back.

No. No, no, no, no.
I told you that I'm not...

09:15.585 --> 09:17.086
Oh, God!

09:17.120 --> 09:19.454
[Groaning]

09:26.029 --> 09:27.029
Tori: Guys!

09:27.063 --> 09:29.231
This is from a traffic camera
two blocks away

09:29.266 --> 09:30.499
from where Beckett was taken.

09:30.533 --> 09:31.833
Esposito: That's a red van.

09:31.868 --> 09:33.635
Heading away
from the abduction area.

09:33.669 --> 09:35.270
- You run the plate?
- Belongs to a plumber in queens.

09:35.304 --> 09:37.439
He reported it stolen
three days ago.

09:37.473 --> 09:39.474
- That's got to be it.
- All right. I'll run an APB.

09:39.509 --> 09:40.809
Make sure you let Castle know.

09:40.843 --> 09:42.176
Yeah, where is Castle?

09:42.211 --> 09:43.612
[Groans]
Where is she?

09:43.646 --> 09:45.146
Get out of here.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.615
Is she alive?

09:46.649 --> 09:48.082
Help! I need help!

09:48.117 --> 09:49.483
Get off me! Get off me!

09:52.221 --> 09:53.321
Where is she?!

09:53.355 --> 09:55.957
- I told you! I don't know!
- Huh?!

09:55.991 --> 09:58.759
Why'd you do it, Tyson?
For revenge?

09:58.794 --> 10:00.661
Because we were happy?

10:00.695 --> 10:02.596
You have got the wrong guy.

10:02.631 --> 10:05.032
The hell I do.

10:05.066 --> 10:06.534
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

[Grunts]

10:10.572 --> 10:11.705
[Groans]

10:11.740 --> 10:13.507
You planned this.

10:13.542 --> 10:15.609
You and Nieman.

10:15.644 --> 10:17.726
But it ends tonight.

10:17.746 --> 10:19.513
Go to hell.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.617
[Breathing shakily]

10:24.652 --> 10:26.453
- Where is she?
- Hey.

10:26.487 --> 10:27.520
No.

10:27.555 --> 10:29.122
Hey, hey, m-man.

10:29.157 --> 10:30.157
No, no, no, no, wait a minute.

10:30.191 --> 10:32.725
Tell me where she is, Tyson,
or so help me, God...

10:32.760 --> 10:33.827
I don't know.

10:33.861 --> 10:36.229
And I'm not Tyson.

10:36.264 --> 10:39.031
He just wants you to thin I am.

10:39.066 --> 10:40.533
- Where is she?
- But I didn't do this.

10:40.568 --> 10:42.469
- I didn't do any of this.
- Where is she?

10:42.503 --> 10:45.638
I-I'm not him!

10:45.673 --> 10:48.575
Dr. Nieman just made me
look like him, but I'm not him.

10:48.609 --> 10:50.543
Where is she?

10:50.578 --> 10:53.545
My name is Michael Boudreau.
I swear.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.848
I was... I was born in Iowa.

10:55.882 --> 10:58.217
I was raised
on 11725 North Genoa Street.

10:58.251 --> 11:00.586
My parents' names
are Michael and Lauren.

11:00.620 --> 11:03.155
I'm... I'm not Jerry Tyson.
I'm not.

11:03.190 --> 11:05.557
[Voice breaking] I swear.

11:05.592 --> 11:07.326
I don't believe you.

[Crying] No, no. Please.

- Officer: Drop the gun!
- Drop it!

11:22.709 --> 11:23.709
Drop your weapon!

11:23.743 --> 11:26.011
Drop it!

11:26.045 --> 11:29.814
You heard me! Drop the gun now!

Let's see your hands!

[Handcuffs click]

11:58.589 --> 12:01.258
[Echoing] Come on, Castle.
Assault with a deadly weapon?

12:01.292 --> 12:03.493
Do you have any idea what
this does to the investigation?

12:03.527 --> 12:05.095
You don't think
I wanted to go over there

12:05.129 --> 12:08.564
and beat the hell out of him...
and Nieman?

12:08.599 --> 12:10.802
That's not gonna get her back.

12:13.771 --> 12:15.805
He's pressing charges.

12:17.874 --> 12:19.241
We're gonna have to book you.

12:19.276 --> 12:20.677
Me?

12:20.711 --> 12:21.944
What about him?

12:21.978 --> 12:24.550
We don't have anything
to hold him on.

12:44.123 --> 12:47.042
You were never gonna win
going straight at him.

12:47.062 --> 12:48.437
If he thought
there was any chance of that,

12:48.471 --> 12:51.328
then he wouldn't have stayed
in that apartment.

12:53.065 --> 12:56.144
We'll take care of the rest
of the booking details later.

12:56.178 --> 12:58.685
- Anything on the van?
- No, not yet.

12:59.481 --> 13:00.648
[Sighs]

13:00.682 --> 13:03.218
You know, when I first got here,

13:03.252 --> 13:07.340
I couldn't figure out
what Beckett saw in you.

13:07.775 --> 13:09.962
But you know what she said?

13:10.860 --> 13:12.994
"He sees the story.

13:13.028 --> 13:14.995
"I see the evidence,
where it leads,

13:15.029 --> 13:19.032
but he sees the story."

13:21.397 --> 13:24.805
That man got inside your head,
and you let him.

13:25.449 --> 13:30.811
You want to help her,
you got to get inside his.

13:30.846 --> 13:33.261
What's his story?

13:33.562 --> 13:37.017
What's his next move
going to be?

13:37.051 --> 13:40.453
Now, you figure that out,
and we'll find her.

[Gate opens]

13:43.024 --> 13:44.824
- Sir.
- What's wrong?

13:44.859 --> 13:46.293
It's Boudreau... Tyson.

13:46.327 --> 13:47.494
On the way back
to his apartment,

13:47.528 --> 13:49.596
he bolted on the subway platform
and jumped onto the tracks.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.807
Our guys tried to follow,
but they lost him.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.701
I want transit authority
on full alert!

13:54.735 --> 13:57.370
Put every unit in the area
on the lookout

13:57.405 --> 13:59.105
and get his picture on the wire!

13:59.139 --> 14:00.273
I want him found!

14:00.307 --> 14:02.809
Captain, I just sent teams to
Kelly Nieman's apartment to check on her.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.010
She's gone.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.377
How can she be gone? We've been
on her place the whole time.

14:06.397 --> 14:08.281
[Cellphone ringing] They found
an access door to the roof open.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.348
She must have went out of it

14:09.383 --> 14:11.030
and climbed across the roof
to another building.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.619
Get an APB out on her and get
teams down to the hospital...

to be that close?

14:26.766 --> 14:28.967
The pain in your eyes.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.369
The suffering.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.740
And all that fear,
knowing that I have her.

Well, if this is about me,
then take me.

Take me and let her go.

14:39.111 --> 14:40.578
No.

14:40.612 --> 14:43.915
No, if I took you,
I'd only get to kill you once.

over and over again.

take you to the airport.

on the other side.

16:04.062 --> 16:07.630
No evidence of anyone
tampering with your phone.

16:07.664 --> 16:10.065
They think that Tyson
must have figured out a way

16:10.099 --> 16:12.151
to spoof your number
from the outside.

16:12.654 --> 16:15.303
Inside, outside...
doesn't matter.

16:15.338 --> 16:18.306

he can get to me anytime.

16:19.485 --> 16:21.110
I'm sorry.

16:22.078 --> 16:25.113
I had him
the night at the motel.

to move a little faster,

react a second sooner...

16:30.319 --> 16:32.320
It's not your fault.

It's his fault.

that stolen red van off the APB.

16:39.528 --> 16:40.595
Where?

16:40.629 --> 16:42.496
Parked outside of an abandoned
industrial property.

16:42.531 --> 16:44.165
- Is she there?
- We don't know.

I got something - third floor.

- How many others?
- Unknown. We don't have a visual.

It's not her!

Who was the girl?

18:26.299 --> 18:28.539
Ryan: Former drug addict,
just like the others.

18:28.573 --> 18:30.707
She was reported missing
last week.

18:30.742 --> 18:33.610
They found a speaker
underneath the chair.

18:33.645 --> 18:36.613
It's how he was able
to broadcast Beckett's voice.

18:36.647 --> 18:37.580
And the weapon?

18:37.615 --> 18:41.751
Pre-aimed at the victim,
triggered remotely.

18:41.785 --> 18:44.175
He wanted us to watch.

18:44.888 --> 18:46.889
He wanted us to watch.

18:46.923 --> 18:49.225
You think she's still alive?

18:50.727 --> 18:52.295
She's alive.

18:52.329 --> 18:54.292
How do you know?

18:54.491 --> 18:56.588
Because he's not done
with me yet.

Good.

19:19.689 --> 19:21.156
You're awake.

19:21.191 --> 19:24.059
We can get started.

19:24.093 --> 19:26.227
Our new victim's name
is Sydney Novak,

19:26.261 --> 19:28.096
from Broward County, Florida.

19:28.130 --> 19:31.265
We believe she may have been
targeted by Tyson and Nieman

19:31.300 --> 19:33.735
due to facial similarities

19:33.769 --> 19:36.450
between her
and Detective Beckett.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.606
Given the nature
of these murders...

19:38.640 --> 19:40.809
We're not gonna find her.

19:40.843 --> 19:42.742
Not like this.

19:43.679 --> 19:46.714
Not by chasing him,
not by playing his game.

19:49.117 --> 19:51.695
We need to take the game to him.

20:11.039 --> 20:13.440
You and your cop friend
put me in here.

For murders
that your cellmate Jerry Tyson

20:16.176 --> 20:18.123
convinced you to commit

20:18.143 --> 20:20.012
so the world would think
you were 3XK

20:20.047 --> 20:22.014
and he would get away scot-free.

20:22.739 --> 20:24.484
Why are you here?

20:25.197 --> 20:28.388
You shared a cell with him
for four years.

20:28.422 --> 20:29.989
Time I'd rather forget.

20:30.023 --> 20:31.375
Why?

20:32.070 --> 20:35.327
You look at him,
you think... "He's so weak."

20:35.362 --> 20:36.796
[Chuckles]

20:36.830 --> 20:38.952
There's nothing to him.

20:40.067 --> 20:41.567
But the guy...

20:41.601 --> 20:43.866
he knew how to get in your head.

20:43.886 --> 20:46.639
He knew how
to make you do things

20:46.673 --> 20:48.512
you never thought capable of.

20:48.532 --> 20:50.643
Like killing for him?

20:51.911 --> 20:54.179
Let's just say
I slept a lot better

20:54.213 --> 20:56.971
once I knew he was dead.

20:56.991 --> 20:58.450
He's not.

20:59.586 --> 21:01.387
Just another way
for him to disappear

21:01.421 --> 21:02.921
so he could make his plans.

21:02.955 --> 21:05.522
- He's alive?
- And he has my wife.

21:06.692 --> 21:09.094
You shared a cell with him
for four years.

21:09.128 --> 21:11.629
No one knows him
better than you.

21:11.664 --> 21:12.697
In all that time,

21:12.731 --> 21:16.734
did he ever mention
a place somewhere in the city,

21:16.769 --> 21:19.404
a place he would go
to feel safe?

21:19.438 --> 21:21.806
[Chuckles] You need my help.

21:22.874 --> 21:24.309
Yes, I need your help.

21:24.343 --> 21:27.178
- You put me in here.
- He put you in here.

21:27.942 --> 21:30.515
He got you to do those things.

21:30.549 --> 21:35.355
He got inside your head,
controlled you like a puppet.

21:35.887 --> 21:40.724
You'd done your time,
but he needed you to get caught.

21:40.964 --> 21:42.326
You sacrificed yourself.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.428
And I bet not a night goes by
you don't see his face

21:44.462 --> 21:47.597
and wonder, "how did he do that?

21:47.961 --> 21:50.939
How did he get me
to throw my life away?"

21:53.585 --> 21:56.272
There was someplace
he talked about...

21:56.307 --> 21:57.674
a place he liked to go.

21:57.709 --> 21:58.908
Where?

22:00.611 --> 22:02.612
What's in it for me?

22:02.647 --> 22:04.291
- What do you want?
- Out.

22:04.311 --> 22:07.319
- You know I don't have the authority...
- I'm sure with all your connections,

22:07.339 --> 22:08.808
you can find someone who does.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.558
They'll never go for it.

22:10.732 --> 22:12.978
Not gonna release a murderer.
They'll let her die first.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.522
That's not my problem.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.593
Please.

22:19.754 --> 22:21.630
Something else.

22:21.665 --> 22:22.866
Money for your family.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.400
Give me something
I can give you.

22:24.434 --> 22:26.236
I don't have a family,
Mr. Castle.

22:26.270 --> 22:28.303
And I am stuck in here for life

22:28.338 --> 22:30.205
without the possibility
of parole,

22:30.240 --> 22:32.754
so what the hell
do you think you could give me

22:33.102 --> 22:35.944
that would be worth a damn?

22:38.181 --> 22:39.671
Revenge.

22:41.458 --> 22:45.254
He's out there, walking around,
and you're in here.

22:45.288 --> 22:47.722
Don't you want
to settle the score?

22:49.714 --> 22:50.538
Fine.

22:50.558 --> 22:52.294
Guess I just didn't think,
after all these years,

22:52.328 --> 22:54.206
you'd still let him control you.

23:00.603 --> 23:02.369
What kind of revenge?

23:07.077 --> 23:09.479
Marcus: There was a place
he talked about...

23:09.514 --> 23:11.047
a house in the woods.

23:11.081 --> 23:12.181
Where?

23:12.216 --> 23:15.452
A little ways up the Hudson,
owned by a family friend.

23:15.751 --> 23:17.587
When he was a kid,
he'd go there in the summers

23:17.622 --> 23:20.490
when things got too intense
with his mother.

23:20.779 --> 23:22.959
Castle: Hello.
Are your archives digitized?

23:22.993 --> 23:24.660
I was wondering
if you could e-mail me

23:24.694 --> 23:26.662
a set of the building plans
for the following address.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.230
You know, you can't save her.

23:29.664 --> 23:32.001
When he sees the cops coming...

23:32.036 --> 23:35.138
and, trust me,
he will see the cops coming...

23:35.172 --> 23:36.680
he won't bargain.

23:36.700 --> 23:37.940
He won't be reasoned with.

23:37.974 --> 23:39.575
He will just...

23:40.411 --> 23:42.277
kill her.

23:42.570 --> 23:44.518
It won't be the cops.

23:50.317 --> 23:51.918
It'll be me.

24:46.374 --> 24:48.542
[Door opens]

24:50.810 --> 24:53.146
Amy Barrett.

24:53.180 --> 24:55.081
You think Barrett was
involved in this?

24:55.116 --> 24:56.941
Or she's a victim, too.

24:58.977 --> 25:01.554
So she was working with them.

26:03.314 --> 26:04.081
[Gun cocks]

26:04.115 --> 26:06.717
Don't scream,
or I will shoot you.

26:06.751 --> 26:08.961
Where's Beckett?
Is she inside the house?

26:10.115 --> 26:12.222
Where is she?

26:12.771 --> 26:14.291
Not here.

26:15.067 --> 26:15.925
Where?

26:15.960 --> 26:18.261
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me.

26:18.296 --> 26:20.597
Not until it's over.

26:20.631 --> 26:22.612
They sent me here to wait.

26:23.667 --> 26:24.534
I don't believe you.

26:24.569 --> 26:26.603
Who's down there?
Who's in the house?

26:28.038 --> 26:30.172
- Just me.
- You're lying.

26:30.207 --> 26:31.774
They're in there, aren't they?

26:31.809 --> 26:33.142
No.

26:33.651 --> 26:36.356
If you bring me back there,
I'll show you.

26:39.216 --> 26:40.016
What are you doing?

26:40.050 --> 26:42.018
Making sure
you stay out of my way.

26:42.052 --> 26:43.953
You know what I love
about this car?

26:43.988 --> 26:45.341
[Beep]

26:46.823 --> 26:48.257
All the trunk space.

26:48.291 --> 26:49.825
Get in.

26:53.296 --> 26:55.297
If I'm lying
and they are down there,

26:55.332 --> 26:56.432
they're gonna miss me soon.

26:56.466 --> 26:59.067
They'll know you're out here.
They'll kill you both.

27:20.150 --> 27:24.859
Despite the situation,
I want you to know I admire you.

27:25.684 --> 27:27.670
I always have.

27:29.196 --> 27:32.277
There's no point
in resisting, detective.

27:32.297 --> 27:36.637
If fact, if you accept that,
I can remove the gag.

27:39.775 --> 27:40.875
Good.

27:41.545 --> 27:43.744
And please don't scream.
It's tedious.

27:43.779 --> 27:46.000
And no one can hear you.

27:49.351 --> 27:50.851
Much better.

27:55.636 --> 27:58.081
It's a crime to cover up
such a lovely face.

27:59.744 --> 28:02.080
Kidnapping and murder
are crimes.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.764
You can still save yourself.

28:04.799 --> 28:06.646
[Chuckles softly]

28:07.056 --> 28:09.240
I've already been saved.

28:09.636 --> 28:11.226
[Whirring]

28:11.246 --> 28:15.041
I used to feel ashamed
of who I was inside,

28:15.076 --> 28:17.115
the things I dreamt about doing.

28:17.135 --> 28:19.337
And then I met Jerry,

28:19.357 --> 28:22.916
and it was like... coming home.

28:22.950 --> 28:25.954
So if you think
that I would ever turn on him,

28:25.974 --> 28:28.187
you don't understand me at all.

28:31.762 --> 28:33.459
What do you think he's gonna do

28:33.493 --> 28:34.927
when you're no longer useful
to him?

28:34.961 --> 28:36.762
He will kill you.

28:38.059 --> 28:40.899
I am your only chance, Kelly.
I can help you.

28:42.315 --> 28:45.137
And you're going to.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.705
[Device beeping]
What are you doing?

28:47.725 --> 28:50.743
With all the police attention,
I'll need a new face.

28:51.837 --> 28:53.326
[Beep]

29:00.085 --> 29:01.657
And I've chosen yours.

29:01.677 --> 29:03.034
No.

29:03.054 --> 29:04.089
No.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.823
No! Please!

29:05.858 --> 29:07.629
- Please.
- This is going back on.

29:07.649 --> 29:09.060
No! Ow!

29:09.094 --> 29:10.061
[Grunts]
Shh.

29:10.095 --> 29:11.796
[Muffled moaning]

31:08.544 --> 31:10.716
She's not here.

31:14.585 --> 31:16.832
Tyson: But you are.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.291
[Crackling]

31:24.325 --> 31:26.471
[Groaning]

31:27.995 --> 31:29.696
[Crackling stops]

31:31.385 --> 31:34.066
So glad you could join me.

31:44.379 --> 31:46.914
Faces fascinate me.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.463
[Beep]

31:51.892 --> 31:54.232
The mask we show to the world.

31:54.252 --> 31:55.969
I find
that clients invariably hope

31:55.989 --> 31:57.979
a procedure
won't just change their looks,

31:57.999 --> 32:03.055
but change who they are
in some deeper way.

32:03.098 --> 32:04.765
Never does.

32:07.436 --> 32:09.402
Any more than painting a house

32:09.437 --> 32:12.236
can change the things
that happen inside of it.

32:21.149 --> 32:22.783
[Cellphone rings]

32:22.817 --> 32:23.917
Yes?

32:23.952 --> 32:25.719
Do you have him?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.295
Yeah, I've got him.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.157
Did you get
what you need from her?

32:31.191 --> 32:32.415
Enough.

32:32.435 --> 32:34.284
I can do the rest after.

32:34.304 --> 32:36.829
Get her ready.

32:36.864 --> 32:38.931
Wait for my call.

32:38.966 --> 32:40.833
[Cellphone beeps]

32:52.014 --> 32:54.313
It'll all be over soon.

32:54.707 --> 32:57.416
But I've so enjoyed
our time together.

33:05.759 --> 33:07.292
Take a seat.

33:15.429 --> 33:16.806
Please.

33:17.316 --> 33:19.190
You have me now.
Just let her go.

33:19.210 --> 33:21.572
Oh, no, no, no. I can't.

33:21.607 --> 33:24.176
She's part of the plan.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.641
Why I brought you here.

33:27.926 --> 33:28.934
Brought me?

33:28.954 --> 33:30.415
You know what I love
about human beings?

33:30.449 --> 33:33.185
Is they're so predictable.
They're like mice.

33:33.219 --> 33:35.759
You can get them to do anything.

33:35.779 --> 33:36.876
All you have to do

33:36.896 --> 33:40.024
is put a little cheese
at the end of the maze

33:40.058 --> 33:42.360
and know exactly
when to shock them.

33:42.394 --> 33:43.954
You knew I was coming.

33:43.974 --> 33:46.731
Dangling Boudreau
in front of you,

33:47.293 --> 33:49.701
watching Beckett die
before your eyes...

33:50.535 --> 33:52.774
once I had the cops
chasing their tails,

33:52.794 --> 33:54.070
I knew it'd be
only a matter of time

33:54.104 --> 33:56.005
before you did something
on your own.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.807
Visiting my old cellie was a...

33:57.827 --> 34:00.377
well, that was a natural choice.

34:01.557 --> 34:03.613
This was a setup.

34:04.387 --> 34:07.184
What better way
to get you here alone

34:07.204 --> 34:09.697
than to make you think
it was your idea?

34:10.888 --> 34:12.121
Why?

34:12.704 --> 34:16.143
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because I want to see your face.

34:16.353 --> 34:18.928
It's why I lured you here...

34:18.963 --> 34:21.464
so I could see your face...

34:21.498 --> 34:24.300
while you watched her die.

No.

so much more than that.

Your inadequacy.

34:45.971 --> 34:49.724
All the games,
all the manipulation...

34:50.091 --> 34:52.627
After I screwed up your plans,

34:53.079 --> 34:56.731
you needed to prove
you were smarter than me.

34:56.766 --> 34:59.601
You needed to know
you could control me.

35:00.413 --> 35:01.936
Mm.

Well, you're here.

they believe
they can't be caught -

35:13.781 --> 35:16.650
because they're smarter
than everyone

35:16.684 --> 35:19.018
and they need to prove it.

Why you did everything.

What do you mean?

35:37.705 --> 35:39.839

It's the only way to find you.

35:42.916 --> 35:46.366
I needed to find you
so I could find her.

But the truth, Jerry...

35:49.016 --> 35:53.278
We're not gonna find her...
not like this.

35:53.654 --> 35:56.823
Not by chasing him,
not by playing his game.

35:56.857 --> 35:59.350
We need to take the game to him.

Put this deep in your ear.
All right? All the way in.

36:10.103 --> 36:12.314
The truth is...

36:12.906 --> 36:15.193
I lured you here...

36:15.640 --> 36:17.777
To watch you die.

Are we clear?

36:21.741 --> 36:23.682

- You have her location?
- Yeah.

- Beckett: Yeah.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.528
That was the stupidest,
most reckless,

you've ever pulled, Mr. Castle.

all right, all right.

of the assault charges.

- Assault charges?
- Uh, it's a... it's a long story.

40:00.719 --> 40:03.034
But, c-captain [Chuckles]
you can't be serious.

40:03.054 --> 40:04.660
Serial killer or no,

40:04.680 --> 40:07.229
you threatened an unarmed man
with a gun.

40:07.249 --> 40:09.268
The D.A. takes that
very seriously.

40:09.303 --> 40:10.463
But...

40:10.649 --> 40:12.727
In light of your outstanding
work on this case,

40:12.747 --> 40:14.320
he's willing to drop the charges

40:14.340 --> 40:17.976
if you agree to 1,000 hours
of community service.

40:18.604 --> 40:20.112
1,000 hours?!

40:20.146 --> 40:21.546
Yes.

40:22.203 --> 40:26.184
As a consultant to Detective Beckett
and the 12th precinct.

40:26.219 --> 40:28.120
I'm... I'm... I'm...

40:28.394 --> 40:30.284
I'm being un-banned?

40:30.304 --> 40:32.356
Mr. Castle, welcome back.

40:32.390 --> 40:33.691
[Laughter]
Okay!

40:33.726 --> 40:35.032
[Laughs]

40:35.052 --> 40:38.096
[Castle and Beckett laugh]

40:46.314 --> 40:47.738
That was my mother and Alexis.

40:47.772 --> 40:49.406
They said
they're on their way home,

40:49.441 --> 40:51.842
just as soon as
they do some shopping.

40:52.870 --> 40:54.446
[Groans]

40:58.094 --> 41:00.316
I don't know how you did it.

41:01.358 --> 41:03.020
What?

41:03.054 --> 41:06.118
Kept it together
the two months I was missing.

41:06.478 --> 41:08.538
Two days, I didn't know
where you were,

41:08.558 --> 41:10.970
and it nearly killed me.

41:17.745 --> 41:20.438
You ever think
about what happened...

41:20.909 --> 41:23.185
when you were gone?

41:23.483 --> 41:25.808
All the time.

41:27.944 --> 41:31.202
Every time I close my eyes,
I see her face.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.082
[Sighs]

41:34.865 --> 41:37.000
I see his, too.

41:37.223 --> 41:39.680
Since that night on the bridge.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.602
You know how I deal with it?

41:43.622 --> 41:45.027
No.

41:45.705 --> 41:48.998
I open my eyes and look at you.

41:54.237 --> 41:56.037
Thanks for coming to get me.

41:58.493 --> 41:59.941
Always.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.616
