08:20.150 --> 08:22.004
RIGHT, 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
GET IT ON THE GLASS?

08:22.120 --> 08:23.144
THAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.704
IS IT MAUVE?
- IT'S NOT MAUVE.

08:24.810 --> 08:25.731
I GOTTA GO.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.533
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
- OKAY, THANKS.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.949
- ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A GOOD COLOR THOUGH.

08:30.060 --> 08:33.951
IT'LL LOOK GOOD WHEN IT'S ON
THE VEAL PARMIGIANA OR WHATEVER.

08:42.830 --> 08:45.549
- HEY.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.935

08:48.040 --> 08:49.268

08:51.630 --> 08:54.178

LIVING HERE NOW?

08:54.290 --> 08:55.382

08:55.500 --> 08:56.831

08:56.950 --> 08:58.497
- YEAH, AMY.
- NO. SHE'S JUST BEEN--

08:58.600 --> 09:00.704
SHE'S STAYING HERE
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

09:00.810 --> 09:01.708
- I'M FINE WITH IT.
I MEAN, WHATEVER,

09:01.810 --> 09:04.392
THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE BLOWING ME OFF,

09:04.500 --> 09:07.776
BUT IT'S LIKE
SHE'S JUST ALWAYS AROUND.

09:07.890 --> 09:10.643
SHE, LIKE, WAITS FOR YOU
OUTSIDE OF CLASS

09:10.750 --> 09:12.684
TO PICK YOU UP AND--LOOK,
EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TALK TO ME

09:12.790 --> 09:14.781
YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND
LIKE YOU DON'T WANT HER

09:14.890 --> 09:16.130
TO SEE US TOGETHER.
- OH, MY GOSH.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.107
- WHAT IS THAT? IT'S JUST--
IT'S WEIRD, THAT'S ALL.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.438
HEY, AMY.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.063
- HEY.

09:23.180 --> 09:26.343

NORA.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.072
STOP.
STOP.

09:33.190 --> 09:34.634
- LOOK, SHE NEEDS
A SPOON TO EAT.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.320
- NO, SHE DOESN'T.
SHE USES HER FINGERS AT HOME.

09:35.430 --> 09:36.328
- I KINDA LIKED IT.

09:36.430 --> 09:38.807
SHE HAS A LOT OF RHYTHM.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.399
- THIS MILK TASTES FUNNY.
- IT DOES?

09:40.510 --> 09:41.260
- IT'S THE SAME MILK
WE USE AT HOME.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.429
- CAN I HAVE WATER INSTEAD?

09:43.540 --> 09:45.360
- ME TOO.
- OH, NOW YOU WANT WATER?

09:45.480 --> 09:46.708
EVERYONE'S TOO GOOD FOR MILK?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.640
- WOW, HAVE THOSE THINGS
COME A LONG WAY.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.069
SINCE BACK IN THE DAY.
YEAH, WHEN CROSBY WAS A BABY

09:51.170 --> 09:53.650
HE HAD TO SCREAM HIS LUNGS OUT
BEFORE WE EVER HEARD HIM.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.239
POOR THING.
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, JABBAR?

09:55.350 --> 09:56.442
YOUR DAD HAD THE LOUDEST LUNGS

09:56.560 --> 09:58.448
I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.
[laughter]

09:58.560 --> 10:00.619
- EXPLAINS A LOT.
[baby monitor feedback]

10:00.730 --> 10:02.004
- I WAS ALWAYS FEARLESS
AND BRAVE.

10:02.110 --> 10:02.667
- THIS THING'S MAKING
TOO MUCH STATIC.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.112
IT'S HURTING MY EARS.

10:04.220 --> 10:07.667
- WELL, LET ME FIX THAT FOR YOU,
YOUNG SQUIRE.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.635
[static gone]
THAT BETTER, MAX?

10:09.740 --> 10:11.913
- IS THAT ALL YOU'RE EATING?
- OH, YEAH.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.567
- I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE
A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.817
- NO, NO, NO.
- YOU'RE NURSING.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.887
- IT'S FINE.
- YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,

10:15.990 --> 10:17.673
YOU NEED FUEL FOR THE--
- DAD, DAD, DAD.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.293
- HMM?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT

10:19.410 --> 10:20.923
MY WIFE'S FUEL SUPPLY.

10:21.030 --> 10:22.019
YEAH?

10:22.130 --> 10:23.165
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LOVE
TO TALK ABOUT

10:23.270 --> 10:24.373
IS THE VISITOR WE HAD EARLIER
THIS MORNING.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.789
I THINK HER NAME WAS KAREN?

10:26.900 --> 10:30.176
AND SHE--DAD--SHE WAS
DROPPING OFF SOME COMPS

10:30.280 --> 10:31.486
SHE SAID THAT YOU
HAD REQUESTED BECAUSE...

10:31.590 --> 10:33.729
- MM-HMM.
- THE HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.102
IS THIS--
- YEAH, MM-HMM.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.176
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.622
- WELL, WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA TELL ME THIS?

10:39.740 --> 10:43.733
- WELL, WE HADN'T REALLY GOTTEN
THAT FAR, SON.

10:43.850 --> 10:44.464
- WELL, IT AFFECTS A LOT OF US.

10:44.570 --> 10:47.915
- AW, CROSBY.
- WHAT?

10:48.020 --> 10:49.601
OUR WHOLE HISTORY
IS IN THIS HOUSE.

10:49.710 --> 10:52.053
YOU CAN'T JUST SELL IT UP
FROM UNDER US

10:52.160 --> 10:54.128
AND ACT LIKE IT'S NOT
A BIG DECISION.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.881
- WE'RE NOT SELLING ANYTHING OUT
FROM UNDER ANYONE.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.230
IT'S OUR HOUSE.
IT'S OUR DECISION.

10:59.340 --> 11:00.477
- UH-HUH.
- WE'D BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT

11:00.590 --> 11:03.514
AND DISCUSSING IT
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

11:03.620 --> 11:07.340
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN
ANYTHING BY YOU OR ANYONE ELSE.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.218
- SO ALL THOSE YEARS I THOUGHT
MY FATHER'S TAKING ME

11:18.330 --> 11:21.254
FOR THIS SECRET,
SPECIAL ICE CREAM TREAT

11:21.370 --> 11:23.509
THAT NONE OF MY BROTHERS
AND SISTERS WERE GETTING,

11:23.610 --> 11:26.192
AND THEN, LIKE,
LAST YEAR I FOUND OUT

11:26.300 --> 11:28.097
NO, NO, HE TOOK THEM ALL...
- OH, NO.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.747
- FOR A SECRET ICE CREAM TREAT,

11:29.860 --> 11:31.646
AND THAT'S THE WAY HE GOT
FOUR ICE CREAMS IN ONE DAY

11:31.760 --> 11:33.990
AND DIDN'T GET IN TROUBLE
WITH MY MOM, SO...

11:34.100 --> 11:35.476
- VERY WISE MAN, I THINK.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:35.590 --> 11:37.922
- WHO APPARENTLY
ENJOYS ICE CREAM.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.247
- I THOUGHT I WAS SO SPECIAL.
- I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY SPECIAL.

11:40.350 --> 11:40.862
YOU'RE SPECIAL. UH-HUH.

11:40.970 --> 11:42.790
MM.
- THIS IS SO GOOD.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.549
I CAN'T--UGH.
- TALK ABOUT SPECIAL.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.173
_ THIS IS MY FAVORITE FOOD,

11:46.290 --> 11:48.667
AND I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT MY SISTER AT HOME.

11:48.770 --> 11:51.216
- UH, OH, JULIA, RIGHT?

11:51.330 --> 11:53.048
IS THAT--
- YEAH.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.468
IT'S NICE OF YOU TO REMEMBER.

11:54.570 --> 11:57.016
YEAH, ANYWAY, HOME RUN, YOU.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.779
- THANK YOU, PEOPLE AT WORK.
- OH, YEAH?

11:58.890 --> 11:59.845
- THEY RECOMMENDED IT.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.781
I POLLED EVERYONE ENDLESSLY.
- WHY?

12:02.890 --> 12:04.812
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I LOVE
THAT PHOTOGRAPH YOU TOOK

12:04.930 --> 12:09.788
OF THE TACO TRUCK, THE BEACH,
AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW,

12:09.900 --> 12:12.130
JUST THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN
TO TIE THAT IN SOMEHOW.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.447
- OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO NICE.
- EH...

12:14.560 --> 12:17.199
- IT'S GREAT. YOU SHOULD TAKE
A DATE HERE SOMETIME.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.242
- OH.
- [laughs]

12:19.350 --> 12:20.692
- I SHOULD TAKE A DATE,
SHOULD I?

12:20.800 --> 12:22.427
- [giggIeSI
- WHAT WOULD I CALL THIS?

12:22.530 --> 12:24.259
JUST HANGING OUT?

12:24.360 --> 12:27.705
- YEAH, MAN, JUST,
YOU KNOW, BEING CASUAL.

12:27.810 --> 12:30.187
- YEAH, HAVE A BEER AND TACOS.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.369
I LIKE THAT.

12:31.470 --> 12:34.530
I LIKE YOU.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.715
I DON'T MEET
THAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE YOU

12:37.820 --> 12:41.301
WHO ARE AS THOUGHTFUL
AND KIND AS YOU ARE.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.890
EVEN IN MY LINE OF WORK,
YOU WOULDN'T THINK

12:44.000 --> 12:45.615
THAT WOULD BE THE CASE,
BUT IT IS.

12:45.730 --> 12:48.619
I LIKE THAT YOU--I DON'T KNOW.

12:48.730 --> 12:50.174
YOU THINK ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY HERE,

12:50.280 --> 12:51.269
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT YOUR SISTER,

12:51.390 --> 12:54.689
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.314
OR HOW FUNNY.

12:57.430 --> 13:01.776
OH, MY GOD, I SOUND LIKE
I MAY BE FALLING FOR YOU.

13:01.880 --> 13:06.499
GUESS THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

13:06.610 --> 13:07.838
BEER, ANYBODY?

13:07.950 --> 13:10.362
- GREAT.
[laughs]

13:10.470 --> 13:12.404
- BE RIGHT BACK.

13:47.580 --> 14:16.434
[toy squeaks]

14:16.470 --> 14:18.461
- HEY.
I DIDN'T WAKE YOU UP, DID I?

14:18.580 --> 14:19.365
- NOT AT ALL.
I AM UP, I'M GOING FOR A RUN.

14:19.470 --> 14:21.813
- A RUN?

14:21.930 --> 14:23.158
- YEAH, YOU CAN SOUND
LESS SURPRISED.

14:23.270 --> 14:25.886
- I WA--I WASN'T SURPRISED.
I KNOW YOU RUN.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.400
IT'S GOOD, IT'S HEALTHY.
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO--

14:28.520 --> 14:29.475
ANYWAY, HOW WAS THE NIGHT?

14:29.590 --> 14:31.649
- IT WAS EIGHT HOURS.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.273
- OH, NOT MUCH SLEEP, HUH?

14:33.380 --> 14:35.416
- NOPE, NOT MUCH.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.241
ACTUALLY, I ENDED UP IN SYDNEY'S
BED, SO THERE'S THAT.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.669
- IT'S OKAY.
IT MAKES SENSE.

14:42.770 --> 14:44.283
- IT'S SO--I MEAN,
LOGICALLY, I KNOW

14:44.400 --> 14:45.708
THAT THIS IS JUST
FOR THE WEEKEND,

14:45.810 --> 14:48.461
BUT IT'S SO QUIET IN HERE.

14:48.570 --> 14:51.050
IT JUST--IT FEELS EMPTY,
IT SOUNDS EMPTY.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.536
- YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

14:52.650 --> 14:54.845
- I DON'T WANNA GET USED TO IT.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.169
- NO, I DON'T--I DON'T MEAN--
I MEAN...

14:59.270 --> 15:00.851
IT WON'T ALWAYS BE THIS WAY.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.133
IT GETS BETTER.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.821
JULIA?

15:04.930 --> 15:06.682
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
I'M GONNA GO.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.062
UM--

15:08.180 --> 15:09.863
HEY, DO YOU WANNA
DO SOMETHING LATER?

15:09.970 --> 15:12.530
HAVE LUNCH OR SOMETHING?
- UM, MAYBE.

15:12.630 --> 15:14.427
UH, LET ME CALL YOU.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.077
LET ME--I'LL CALL YOU AFTER.

15:16.190 --> 15:17.214
- OKAY.
- BYE.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.251
- BYE.

15:21.190 --> 15:23.112
- I'M CONFUSED.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.367
SHE'S LIVING IN--IN YOUR
DORM ROOM WITH YOU?

15:24.470 --> 15:26.745
- YES, SHE'S LIVING
IN MY DORM WITH ME.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.909
- WHAT DOES SHE
DO ALL D--I MEAN--

15:29.030 --> 15:29.598
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- WAIT.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.881
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE TOO.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.614
HER PARENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.234
- I MEAN, THAT'S WEIRD.

15:35.340 --> 15:38.468
- WHAT SHE'S SAYING IS THAT
I JUST MAKE HER HAPPY

15:38.590 --> 15:43.175
AND SHE JUST WANTS TO BE AROUND
ME AND ALL THIS STUFF.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.339
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:45.460 --> 15:50.568
- HER TO LEAVE AND GO BACK
TO SCHOOL, YOU KNOW?

15:50.670 --> 15:53.423
I LOVE HER.

15:53.530 --> 15:58.911
I-I DO, BUT...

15:59.020 --> 16:01.124
- IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S--

16:01.230 --> 16:05.985
YOU CAN REALLY LOVE SOMEBODY,
BUT...

16:06.100 --> 16:07.431
ALSO WANT THEM TO GO.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.791
- WHY DON'T WE HAVE
ANY POST-ITS?

16:18.900 --> 16:22.006

16:22.110 --> 16:23.691

16:27.880 --> 16:28.665
CAN YOU HAVE THE WRONG COLOR?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.463
WHAT DO YOU GOTTA DO THEN?

16:30.570 --> 16:31.946
YOU GOTTA START--
- I DON'T KNOW,

16:32.060 --> 16:32.947
BUT IT WORKED OUT FINE.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.561
- YOU LADIES GOT IT ROUGH.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.056
I GOTTA BE HONEST.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.502
- WHY DO WE LADIES
HAVE IT ROUGH?

16:37.610 --> 16:40.955
- TOO MANY THINGS YOU GOTTA
ACCESSORIZE AND ALL THAT.

16:41.060 --> 16:44.518
- HEY, DID YOU MESS WITH THESE?

16:44.620 --> 16:46.656
THE SURFSPORT?

16:46.760 --> 16:48.921

16:52.660 --> 16:54.139
YOU JUST TOOK
ALL THE TRUCKS OUT?

16:54.250 --> 16:55.899
- YES, I MADE--I MADE IT BETTER.
- HANK!

16:56.010 --> 16:58.456
THESE ARE MY--THIS IS MY WORK.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SO MAD

16:58.560 --> 17:01.256
THAT I PUT ON LIPSTICK TO GO ON
A CASUAL DINNER WITH CARL

17:01.360 --> 17:02.429
THAT YOU MESSED

17:02.530 --> 17:03.633

17:03.740 --> 17:05.014
_ "T. II
"T," OKAY?

17:05.120 --> 17:06.530
LEAVE FEED THE WORLD
OUT OF THIS.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.846
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.429
WE HAVE TO BRING
THIS TO A CLIENT.

17:09.540 --> 17:10.575
IT'S GOTTA LOOK PROFESSIONAL.
- I KNOW.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.533
THE CLIENT HIRED ME.

17:11.650 --> 17:12.878
I AM THE PROFESSIONAL.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.129
I HIRED YOU TO HELP ME,
NOT SABOTAGE ME.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.231
- SAB--SAB--
THESE AREN'T BETTER?

17:17.340 --> 17:18.261
THESE ARE NOT BETTER?

17:18.380 --> 17:19.859
THAT DOESN'T LOOK BETTER?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.894

17:22.000 --> 17:24.514
OKAY, I MEAN--

BETTER WITHOUT IT,

17:27.460 --> 17:30.793
BUT--80%, YOU KNOW,
BUT NOT ALL OF THEM.

17:30.910 --> 17:31.899

THANK YOU.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.001

17:34.120 --> 17:34.905
YOU CAN'T JUST
DO STUFF ON YOUR OWN.

- WELL, WE DID WORK ON IT.

17:35.810 --> 17:36.595
WE HAVE TO WORK ON IT TOGETHER

17:36.710 --> 17:38.564
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.

17:38.670 --> 17:39.489
COMMUNICATING.

17:39.610 --> 17:40.679
- LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.
- YOU HAVE AN IDEA

17:40.780 --> 17:43.010
AND I HAVE AN IDEA, AND THEN

17:43.130 --> 17:43.846
WE MAKE A DECISION TOGETHER.

17:43.950 --> 17:45.645
THAT'S WHAT WORKING TOGETHER--

17:45.750 --> 17:47.126
I HAVE TO G--
I'M GONNA GET A COFFEE.

17:47.230 --> 17:48.162
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:48.270 --> 17:49.237
- I'M GONNA GET A COFFEE.

17:49.340 --> 17:49.852
I NEED TO JUST RELAX
FOR A MINUTE.

17:49.960 --> 17:50.927
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.645
IF IT LOOKS BETTER,
IT LOOKS BETTER.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.648
- IT'S NOT THE POINT.
- IT IS THE POINT!

18:00.180 --> 18:02.728
80--MORE THAN 80%.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.245
- [sighs]

18:10.840 --> 18:15.868
MM.
[laughs]

18:15.990 --> 18:18.015
THIS IS SO AWESOME, HONEY.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.438
- OH, GOD.

18:19.540 --> 18:21.508
IT IS.

18:21.610 --> 18:22.850
- HMM.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.167
[laughs]

18:25.270 --> 18:26.441
- BEEN A LONG TIME...

18:26.550 --> 18:28.302
- YES, IT HAS.

18:28.410 --> 18:30.093
- SINCE WE TOOK A BREAK.

18:30.210 --> 18:34.169
YEAH, IT'S BEEN
A ROUGH COUPLE OF YEARS.

18:44.150 --> 18:46.493
- THANK YOU.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.672
I JUST--I-I DON'T KNOW IF I
EVER TRULY SAID THANK YOU TO YOU

18:53.780 --> 18:59.093
FOR--FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DID
FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

18:59.200 --> 19:02.715
GOING THROUGH THAT TOGETHER,
I-I DON'T THINK

19:02.830 --> 19:04.718
I'VE EVER REALLY,
TRULY SAID "THANK YOU."

19:04.830 --> 19:06.513
LIKE A...

19:10.730 --> 19:12.277
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.622
LISTEN, IF I GOTTA
BE STUCK IN THE MUD...

19:16.740 --> 19:17.695
- [giggIeSI
- I WANNA BE STUCK IN THE MUD

19:17.810 --> 19:20.699
WITH YOU.
- [glggleSI

19:20.810 --> 19:23.870
WELL, YOU'RE STUCK.

19:23.990 --> 19:27.847
- I MEAN, LOOK, THESE TOXINS
ARE JUST DRIPPING OFF OF ME.

19:37.830 --> 19:41.345
- SEE, THIS IS WHY I'M TAKING
ALL THOSE PILLS,

19:41.450 --> 19:43.657
SO I CAN REMEMBER
WHERE I PUT MY SOCKET WRENCHES,

19:43.760 --> 19:44.727
AND I CAN'T FIND 'EM.

19:44.830 --> 19:47.458
- WELL, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU PUT 'EM LAST?

19:47.560 --> 19:49.243
- COULD YOU JUST MAKE YOURSELF
USEFUL AND LOOK TOO?

19:49.360 --> 19:50.907
- IN THIS TRASH HEAP?

19:51.010 --> 19:52.147
[sighs]

19:52.260 --> 19:55.115
DAD, THEY'RE RIGHT--
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.630
- NO, THOSE ARE THE OLD ONES.

19:56.740 --> 19:58.731
- THIS IS A SOCKET SET.
- THOSE ARE THE OLD ONES.

19:58.850 --> 19:59.987
- THIS IS THE OLD ONES.

20:00.090 --> 20:02.365
HEAVEN FORBID YOU USE THE OLD--
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:02.470 --> 20:05.359
MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK IN THE HOUSE
FOR THE NEW SET.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.640
HUH?

20:06.750 --> 20:08.786
THE HOUSE, MY CHILDHOOD HOME
THAT'S ON THE MARKET?

20:08.890 --> 20:10.778
THIS--IT'S JUST RIGHT HERE.

20:10.890 --> 20:12.619
I BETTER LOOK NOW BEFORE...
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.789
- YOU'RE SLASHING PRICES,
I KNOW.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.299
- OKAY, WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:15.420 --> 20:16.557
- WHY AREN'T YOU
SAYING ANYTHING?

20:16.660 --> 20:18.309
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING MUCH
TO SAY, CROSBY.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.069
- THERE'S A TON TO SAY.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.761
AM I NOT TALKING
TO ZEEK BRAVERMAN?

20:21.870 --> 20:24.100
OF ALL PEOPLE, YOU SHOULD
BE RAISING A RED FLAG.

20:24.220 --> 20:26.279
I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'T MOVE OUT
OF HERE IN A MILLION YEARS.

20:26.390 --> 20:27.425
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:27.530 --> 20:28.667
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET ME

20:28.770 --> 20:31.045
WORRY ABOUT WHAT I WOULD
OR WOULDN'T DO, ALL RIGHT?

20:31.160 --> 20:33.708
- YOU DON'T SEEM
TO BE WORRYING ABOUT IT.

20:36.200 --> 20:36.700
DAD.

20:38.850 --> 20:40.738
- OKAY.
GOT 'EM.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.613
[grunts]
- OH, GREAT.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.709
DAD.
- HUH?

20:44.820 --> 20:45.991
- LISTEN--HEY, HEY.

20:46.100 --> 20:50.651
WH--PLEASE.

20:50.760 --> 20:54.036
- YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER 47 YEARS,

20:54.140 --> 20:55.550
AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

20:55.660 --> 20:58.106
WE'VE...BEEN THROUGH
A LOT OF MILESTONES.

20:58.220 --> 20:59.551
THEN SHE GOES AWAY TO EUROPE,

20:59.670 --> 21:01.592
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
I'M LEFT HERE AT THE HOUSE.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.519
I'M ALL ALONE.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.049
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL I'M GONNA DO

21:03.150 --> 21:03.900
AND I MISS HER.

21:04.020 --> 21:06.807
I MISS HER LIKE CRAZY.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.538
I REALIZE THAT...

21:10.640 --> 21:11.811
I LOVE HER A LOT MORE
THAN I LOVE THIS HOUSE,

21:11.920 --> 21:15.606
AND IF SELLING THIS HOUSE
MAKES HER HAPPY,

21:15.720 --> 21:18.473
THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

21:18.580 --> 21:19.820
SO THAT'S ABOUT IT, SON.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.854
THAT'S--THAT'S
THE BALLGAME RIGHT THERE.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.289
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,
TRYING TO PICK UP THE PACE?

21:32.390 --> 21:33.618
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO PICK UP NOTHING.

21:33.740 --> 21:34.729
- TRYING TO RACE ME?
- TRYING TO GET TO THE SUMMIT.

21:34.840 --> 21:35.807
- YOU'RE TRYING TO RACE ME, HUH?
- YOU'RE SLOW.

21:35.910 --> 21:37.002
- WANNA PLAY TORTOISE
AND THE HARE?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.394
- NO. COME ON!
- HUH? COME ON!

21:38.500 --> 21:40.149
- WHOO!
- TURNING ON THE TURBO BOOST.

21:40.260 --> 21:43.058
I GOT IT.
[laughs]

21:43.160 --> 21:45.708
- THAT WAS SO WRONG!

21:45.820 --> 21:47.503
- OH.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.885
HONEY, THIS IS GORGEOUS.

21:49.990 --> 21:52.026
- IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.779
WOW.

21:53.890 --> 21:55.892
[laughs]

21:56.000 --> 21:58.821
THIS HAS BEEN REALLY NICE.
- IT'S BEEN GREAT.

21:58.930 --> 22:01.558
[birds crying]

22:01.660 --> 22:02.797
- WHOO.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.891
I'M OUT OF SHAPE.

22:05.010 --> 22:07.934
YOU OKAY?

22:10.430 --> 22:13.467
- I JUST--I TEXTED JULIA EARLIER

22:13.570 --> 22:14.116
AND I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT HER.

22:14.220 --> 22:15.733
THAT'S WHO I CALLED

22:15.850 --> 22:17.226
WHEN I GOT OUT'Jl-CIJF THE HOT TUB.

22:17.330 --> 22:18.945
- LOOK, I KNOW
SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN,

22:19.060 --> 22:20.914
SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF,
AND SHE DOESN'T NEED ME THERE.

22:21.020 --> 22:25.298
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE
I NEEDED TO BE THERE, SO...

22:25.410 --> 22:27.753
- YEAH.
GOOD, OKAY.

22:27.860 --> 22:30.442

WE SUMMITED THIS,

22:30.550 --> 22:32.415
WE DID THE HOT TUBBIN',

22:32.520 --> 22:33.418

23:01.620 --> 23:04.339
OH, MY HAMMY!
[chuckles]

23:05.030 --> 23:08.033
- THANKS FOR SEEING ME,
ESPECIALLY ON A SATURDAY, DOC.

23:08.140 --> 23:09.232
- NO.
- APPRECIATE IT.

23:09.350 --> 23:10.794
- SO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.481
- I'M HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THIS WOMAN.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.000
NO, NOT A WOMAN.
IT'S NOT A WOMAN.

23:14.110 --> 23:16.795
I MEAN, IT'S A WOMAN, BUT
IT'S A COWORKER IS WHAT IT IS.

23:16.910 --> 23:19.902
- OKAY.
- IT'S MY SUPERIOR...

23:20.010 --> 23:21.739
ON THIS JOB--
WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER.

23:21.840 --> 23:22.659
- SURE.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.702
- AND I GUESS--
I GUESS I EDITED

23:24.810 --> 23:26.698
SOME OF HER PHOTOS
WITHOUT LETTING HER KNOW.

23:26.810 --> 23:29.699
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH
I MADE 'EM BETTER.

23:29.820 --> 23:32.197
SHE EVEN ADMITTED
THAT I MADE 'EM BETTER.

23:32.300 --> 23:34.165
800/0.
- MM-HMM.

23:34.270 --> 23:37.068
- 800/0.

23:37.170 --> 23:38.683
SHE'S ANGRY.

23:38.790 --> 23:40.849
I MEAN, SHE'S VERY ANGRY.
- I'M GONNA STOP YOU THERE.

23:40.970 --> 23:42.722
THAT CERTAIN LY
SOUNDS LIKE A PROBLEM.

23:42.830 --> 23:47.130
I WOULDN'T CLASSIFY THAT
AS AN EMERGENCY,

23:47.250 --> 23:49.901
WHICH IS WHAT
YOUR MESSAGE SAID.

23:50.010 --> 23:52.069
- YEAH.
- OKAY?

23:52.180 --> 23:52.760
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:52.870 --> 23:54.633
- YOU GET ONE OF THESE, HANK.

23:54.740 --> 23:57.322
- I DIDN'T WANNA
WAIT TILL MONDAY.

23:57.430 --> 23:58.658
I JUST--
- OKAY.

23:58.780 --> 24:01.248
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU EDITED
THESE PHOTOS

24:01.370 --> 24:03.361
WITHOUT COMMUNICATING WITH HER.

24:03.470 --> 24:05.051
- YES.
- IS THAT--

24:05.160 --> 24:06.809
- YES, I--YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SAID.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.059
- OKAY.
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

24:09.170 --> 24:10.785
THAT'S MY PROBLEM,
I GUESS.

24:10.890 --> 24:14.337
WHAT DO I DO?
HOW DO I, UH...

24:14.450 --> 24:17.101
WHAT DO I SAY
TO MAKE IT BETTER?

24:17.210 --> 24:20.270
- WELL, MAYBE THE BEST PLACE
TO START IS WITH LISTENING.

24:20.380 --> 24:22.007
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE COMMUNICATING--

24:22.110 --> 24:25.216
- LET ME JUST--LET ME JUST, UH--
- SURE.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.699
- I'M GONNA--YOU KNOW--
- WHEN YOU'RE COMMUNICATING

24:28.810 --> 24:32.632
WITH SOMEONE, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT
THEM WHILE THEY'RE TALKING.

24:32.740 --> 24:35.868
THAT WAY THEY KNOW THAT YOU'RE
ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION,

24:35.990 --> 24:38.299
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.537
- RIGHT, RIGHT, LIKE NOW.

24:39.650 --> 24:41.049
I'M NOT LOOKING AT--
I MEAN, I'M LOOKING HERE,

24:41.160 --> 24:43.640
BUT I DON'T LOOK AT--
I SHOULD LOOK AT YOU SO YOU--

24:43.750 --> 24:46.127
- SURE.
- YEAH.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.992
- CORRECT.
- OKAY, GO.

24:48.100 --> 24:51.228
- OKAY, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT HER PICTURES,

24:51.350 --> 24:54.035
TRY TO USE POSITIVE STATEMENTS,
NOT JUST CRITICAL ONES.

24:54.140 --> 24:55.129
- I DID.
I TOLD HER THEY WERE VERY GOOD.

24:55.250 --> 24:58.105
I SAID POSITIVE THINGS.
I'M SURE OF THAT.

24:58.220 --> 25:01.621
- RIGHT, BUT SINCE YOU WENT
AND CHANGED THEM ANWVAY,

25:01.740 --> 25:04.186
MAYBE YOU SHOULD OFFER
AN APOLOGY.

25:04.290 --> 25:07.464
SAY THAT YOU'RE SORRY
FOR MAKING HER ANGRY.

25:07.570 --> 25:09.299
- OKAY, YEAH.
THIS IS GOOD.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.367
THIS IS GOOD.

25:10.470 --> 25:13.018
COULD YOU--I MEAN, BE SPECIFIC?

25:13.130 --> 25:15.462
JUST SAY IT THE WAY
I WOULD SAY IT.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.502
I WON'T USE THOSE WORDS OR--
- SURE.

25:17.610 --> 25:19.612
- IT'S SOMETHING FOR ME
TO LOOK AT, YOU KNOW?

25:19.720 --> 25:20.994
- ALL RIGHT, YOU COULD SAY
SOMETHING LIKE

25:21.100 --> 25:24.729
"I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
I SHOULDN'T EDIT THOSE PHOTOS

25:24.830 --> 25:26.445
"WITHOUT TALKING WITH YOU.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.757
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING."

25:28.870 --> 25:29.894
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

25:30.010 --> 25:31.454
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GOOD.

25:31.560 --> 25:35.314
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, AND THEN
THE--SAY THE FIRST PART AGAIN.

25:35.430 --> 25:36.351
JUST SLOW.

25:36.460 --> 25:37.973
- HOW GOOD IS THIS?

25:38.080 --> 25:39.809
YOU KNOW, THE BEST PART IS,
THIS PIZZA PLACE

25:39.910 --> 25:43.118
IS, LIKE, TWO BLOCKS DOWN,
SO WE CAN ORDER IT ANYTIME.

25:43.230 --> 25:45.676
- MM-HMM.
- THE PEPPERONI'S REALLY GOOD.

25:45.780 --> 25:48.362
- YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE
A SATURDAY TRADITION, HMM?

25:48.470 --> 25:49.846
- LIKE EVERY SATURDAY?

25:49.960 --> 25:53.817
- WELL, YEAH, ANY WEEKEND
YOU'RE--YOU'RE HERE.

25:53.930 --> 25:55.784
$0 FOR TOMORROW I WAS THINKING
EITHER MINI GOLF

25:55.890 --> 25:57.778
OR WE COULD DO, UM,
WHAT'S THAT MOVIE YOU--

25:57.900 --> 26:00.039
- THE ONE WITH THE ROBOTS
WITH THE FIGHTING?

26:00.140 --> 26:01.061
- YEAH, YEAH.

26:01.180 --> 26:02.932
- WE'RE HERE
ALL DAY TOMORROW TOO?

26:03.040 --> 26:04.109
- YEAH, BUG.

26:04.210 --> 26:07.338
- I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING HOME IN THE MORNING.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.485
- NO.
NO, I GOT YOU ALL WEEKEND.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.909
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A--
A GREAT TIME TOMORROW.

26:12.010 --> 26:14.251
IS THERE A MOVIE
YOU WANTED TO SEE?

26:14.360 --> 26:16.635
IS THERE--YOU KNOW?

26:16.740 --> 26:19.254
I'M HAPPY TO--
- I WANNA GO HOME.

26:19.370 --> 26:22.225
- I KNOW YOU DO,
BUT WE'RE HERE.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.503
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

26:24.610 --> 26:25.816
- I KNOW, BUG.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.888
- CAN I HAVE THE LAST SLICE?

26:28.000 --> 26:31.026
- YEAH, BUDDY.

26:36.070 --> 26:38.106
[knocks on door]

26:41.220 --> 26:43.450
- UH, JUST WANT TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.902
- I JUST GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER.

26:45.010 --> 26:47.899
- YEAH, JUST GONNA TAKE A COUPLE
OF MINUTES, THAT ALL.

26:48.020 --> 26:49.635
- COME IN, JUST LET ME
GET DRESSED.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.014
- NO, NO, HOLD ON, I JUST
WANNA JUST SIT RIGHT HERE

26:51.120 --> 26:52.678
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
- WHAT?

26:52.780 --> 26:54.361
CAN I PUT PANTS ON?
- JUST FOR ONE MINUTE.

26:54.470 --> 26:54.947
JUST ONE MINUTE.
I JUST WANNA TALK.

26:55.060 --> 26:57.051
SIT DOWN.

26:59.130 --> 27:04.022
UM...SO...I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT THE PHOTOS,

27:04.130 --> 27:07.270
THE LITTLE DUST-UP
WE HAD BACK AT THE STUDIO.

27:07.380 --> 27:08.449
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

27:08.550 --> 27:10.791
SO I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT, UH,

27:10.900 --> 27:13.653
THAT I'M SORRY
THAT I MADE YOU ANGRY.

27:13.770 --> 27:15.829
- OKAY.

27:15.940 --> 27:20.695
- AND, UH...I, UH...

27:20.810 --> 27:22.459
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

27:22.570 --> 27:26.666
THAT I SHOULDN'T EDIT THE PHOTOS
WITHOUT TALKING TO YOU.

27:26.780 --> 27:29.226
AND I, UM--I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND

27:29.330 --> 27:30.888
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING.
- WHAT IS HAPPENING?

27:30.990 --> 27:32.912
- I'M LOOKING AT YOU
AND I'M TALKING TO YOU.

27:33.030 --> 27:37.330
- IT'S JUST LIKE YOU'RE RECITING
SOMETHING YOU MEMORIZED.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.135
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I'M JUST TALKING TO YOU.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.276
- I KNOW, JUST TALK TO ME
IN YOUR NORMAL VOICE.

27:41.380 --> 27:43.541
- IT IS MY NORMAL VOICE.

27:43.660 --> 27:45.969
OH, FORGET IT.

27:46.070 --> 27:47.002
- WH--WHAT?

27:50.320 --> 27:53.244
- THE BOOK--REMEMBER THE BOOK?
THE ASPERGER'S BOOK?

27:53.360 --> 27:56.386
I'M SEEING THIS GUY
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.900
ABOUT HOW
IT'S AFFECTING MY LIFE.

27:59.020 --> 28:02.672
AND, UH, I'M NOT
A PEOPLE PERSON.

28:02.780 --> 28:08.332
I, UH, I'M NOT LIKE CARL.
I NEVER WILL BE.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.509
I DON'T KNOW.

28:09.610 --> 28:11.919
SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD IDEA
AT THE OFFICE.

28:16.310 --> 28:21.930
IT'S JUST I HAVEN'T BEEN
THAT GOOD WITH YOU, AND, UH...

28:22.040 --> 28:24.417
I'M TRYING TO DO BETTER.

28:43.480 --> 28:44.981
- HEY, BABE.
- HEY.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.822
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

28:49.930 --> 28:53.718
UH...
- YOU--YOU OKAY?

28:53.830 --> 28:56.651
- YEAH, I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

28:56.760 --> 28:59.240
ABOUT SOMETHING REALLY QUICK.

28:59.350 --> 29:01.238
- OKAY.
- UM...

29:04.250 --> 29:07.083
YOU KNOW,
I ONLY SAY ANY OF THIS

29:07.190 --> 29:10.569
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH,

29:10.670 --> 29:12.740
BUT...

29:12.850 --> 29:16.809
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE
LIKE THIS.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.809
- IS...THIS A NATALIE THING?

29:21.930 --> 29:23.306
- NO.
_ OR--

29:23.410 --> 29:25.719
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL.
- OKAY.

29:25.830 --> 29:28.617
I MEAN, I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
HAVING ME VISIT.

29:28.730 --> 29:31.938
- NO, AMY, OF COURSE, I LOVE
HAVING YOU VISIT, YOU KNOW?

29:32.040 --> 29:35.487
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF
HIDING FROM SOMETHING.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.660
- HIDING?
- YES, EVEN LAST YEAR.

29:38.770 --> 29:40.180
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

29:40.290 --> 29:44.841
YOU KNOW, DID YOU EVER TALK
TO ANYONE ABOUT THAT?

29:44.950 --> 29:48.465
BECAUSE ALL WE HAD
WAS EACH OTHER...

29:48.570 --> 29:50.709
AND...YOU RAN OFF.

29:50.820 --> 29:53.675
WE NEVER EVEN TALKED ABOUT IT.

29:53.790 --> 29:56.645
YOU KNOW, AND I...

29:56.760 --> 29:59.331
I ENDED UP TALKING TO MY MOM.

29:59.450 --> 30:01.896
- YOU TOLD YOUR MOM
I GOT THE ABORTION?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.479
- YES, I TOLD MY MOM.
I'M SORRY.

30:03.590 --> 30:05.820
- DREW.
- OKAY?

30:05.940 --> 30:08.386
BUT IT WAS SO HELPFUL.

30:08.490 --> 30:13.189
IT JUST FEELS SO GOOD
TO TALK TO SOMEONE

30:13.290 --> 30:15.451
WHO'S NOT INVOLVED
IN IT THE SAME WAY.

30:15.570 --> 30:17.083
YOU KNOW?

30:17.190 --> 30:19.806
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.980
NOT EVEN JUST ABOUT THAT,
BUT ABOUT SCHOOL,

30:23.090 --> 30:24.193
EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

30:24.300 --> 30:28.259
YOU NEED TO--YOU NEED
TO TELL THEM THAT.

30:35.210 --> 30:35.995
[beeping]

30:36.110 --> 30:40.888
- THE HOUSE AND I
ARE ALL ALONE

30:41.010 --> 30:42.864
[phone chimes]

30:42.970 --> 30:51.321
LONELY HOUSE

30:51.430 --> 30:55.742
LONELY ME

30:55.850 --> 30:56.839

30:56.950 --> 30:57.814

30:57.920 --> 31:00.297
- BUT I GOT SUCH
A GOOD BOTTLE OF WINE.

31:00.410 --> 31:02.093
I KNOW IT'S GOOD
BECAUSE I STOLE IT FROM CARL.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.304
AND CHINESE FOOD BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,

31:04.410 --> 31:06.139
WHAT CHEERS ANYBODY UP
MORE THAN CHINESE FOOD?

31:06.240 --> 31:07.548
NOT THIS MUSIC,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

31:07.650 --> 31:08.890
- THANK YOU.
- WHOO!

31:09.000 --> 31:10.410

SO THAT WAS WORSE.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.272
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
ADELE IS FOR SAD TIMES.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.177
WE'RE GONNA--WE'RE GONNA
ROCK THIS PARTY.

31:14.280 --> 31:14.939
- THIS LOOKS REALLY NICE.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.894
[knocks on door]
THANK YOU.

31:17.010 --> 31:18.318
OH, MY GOD.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.660
- [gaSPSI
- HI. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT

31:19.770 --> 31:21.169
WANT SOME COMPANY.
OH!

31:21.290 --> 31:22.837
- DID YOU CALL EACH OTHER?
- GREAT MINDS, GREAT MINDS.

31:22.950 --> 31:23.871

31:27.020 --> 31:28.089
MUCH CHEAPER WINE THAN THAT.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.043

- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.081
- WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?

31:30.190 --> 31:31.157
IS THIS THE, UM,
"KILL MYSELF?"

31:31.260 --> 31:32.739
- I'M TRYING
TO FIND SOMETHING GOOD.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.465
- LEAVE THIS TO ME, YEAH.
OKAY.

31:34.580 --> 31:36.400

31:37.960 --> 31:40.167
[upbeat jazz]

31:40.270 --> 31:41.680
THAT'S SOME FEEL-GOOD MUSIC.
- OKAY.

31:41.790 --> 31:43.303
- I VOTE FOR GETTING
A LITTLE BUZZ ON

31:43.410 --> 31:44.616
BEFORE WE GET INTO THE CARBS.

31:44.730 --> 31:45.890
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- OKAY.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.412

WARM--NUMBING.

YOU'RE A BETTER BROTHER

31:59.360 --> 32:00.429
THAN I EVER COULD IMAGINE.

32:00.530 --> 32:01.189

YOU'RE A BETTER PERSON THAN--

32:01.290 --> 32:03.042
- YOU GUYS.

32:04.370 --> 32:05.155

32:05.260 --> 32:07.740
- EVEN MY DRY CLEANER
ASKED ME...

32:07.850 --> 32:09.738
- OF COURSE
THE DRY CLEANER ASKED.

32:09.850 --> 32:10.748
- WHY I HAD NO SHIRTS
FOR MY HUSBAND.

32:10.850 --> 32:12.260
- THE DRY CLEANER KNOWS ALL.

32:12.370 --> 32:14.167
- OH, MY GOD, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TELL EVERYBODY

32:14.270 --> 32:15.339
THAT I'M SEPARATED?

32:15.450 --> 32:16.337
- OH, HONEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

32:16.450 --> 32:17.644
DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANNA DO.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.068
- I DON'T WANT TO.

32:19.170 --> 32:20.512
I DON'T--I DON'T WANNA
TELL ANYBODY ELSE.

32:20.620 --> 32:23.009
- WELL, I GUESS THEY ARE IN
THE BUSINESS OF DIRTY LAUNDRY.

32:23.110 --> 32:26.318
[laughter]

32:26.420 --> 32:27.626
- WHOO!

32:27.730 --> 32:30.005
- YOU GUYS, I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT MOM AND DAD.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.144
- WHY?
- IT'S JUST--

32:31.250 --> 32:33.491
BECAUSE I'M THE BLACK SHEEP.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.591
I'M--
- OF OUR FAMILY?

32:35.710 --> 32:36.665
LOOK WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.701
- OKAY, I'M LIKE...

32:37.810 --> 32:39.016
- A GRAY SHEEP.

32:39.120 --> 32:39.939
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN
ON THE SPECTRUM

32:40.060 --> 32:41.436
OF BLACK SHEEP.

32:41.540 --> 32:44.054
- THINK OF ALL THE STUFF
THAT THE TWO OF US HAVE DONE

32:44.160 --> 32:46.503
TO MAKE MOM AND DAD FEEL ASHAMED
AND EMBARRASSED.

32:46.610 --> 32:49.852
- YOU GO SLEEP WITH
YOUR NEPHEW'S BEHAVIORAL AID...

32:49.960 --> 32:51.131
- YEAH.
- AND THEN YOU TALK TO ME

32:51.240 --> 32:52.207
ABOUT BEING A BLACK SHEEP.
- THAT'S VALID.

32:52.310 --> 32:54.039
- YOU HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING OF THE SORT.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.414
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
- WHAT ABOUT THIS DIRT BAG

32:55.520 --> 32:57.067
SETH SHE WAS LINKED UP TO?
- DIRT BAG.

32:57.180 --> 32:58.169

33:07.840 --> 33:11.606
ALONE WITH THESE TWO, OKAY?
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME.

33:11.710 --> 33:12.802
- EVERYBODY CAME ON THEIR OWN.
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.911
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- HAVING A LITTLE PARTY,

33:15.020 --> 33:16.499

- IT'S A RIDICULOUS GAME.
- YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.408
- IT'S HARD BEING
MR. PERFECT PANTS.

33:22.510 --> 33:23.920
- HOW MANY BOTTLES OF WINE AWAY
ARE WE HERE ANYWAY?

33:24.030 --> 33:25.201
- OH!
- WHO'S COUNTING?

33:25.310 --> 33:26.618
- THE--THE AUDITOR'S HERE.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.540
- I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY AND PLAY
A LITTLE CATCH-UP HERE.

33:28.660 --> 33:29.820
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
- WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

33:29.930 --> 33:30.897
- OH, BOY.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.968
WE HAVE FOOD.
WE HAVE SO MUCH FOOD LEFT.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.002
- A LITTLE MALBEC.
IS THIS IT?

33:35.110 --> 33:37.214

33:37.320 --> 33:38.628
THERE'S PROBABLY MORE.

33:38.740 --> 33:39.832
I-I CAN'T--I CAN'T BELIEVE

33:39.940 --> 33:42.010
THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.451
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ALL--

33:43.570 --> 33:45.913
THAT EACH OF YOU
THOUGHT TO COME OVER HERE.

33:46.020 --> 33:46.702
all: OF COURSE WE DID.

33:46.810 --> 33:48.778
- BUT NO, NOT OF COURSE.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.053
THIS IS AMAZING.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.127
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.607

OF COURSE WE'RE HERE.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.789
WHERE ELSE WOULD WE BE?

CHEERING YOU UP THOUGH,

33:57.580 --> 33:59.263
NOT CHEERING YOU DOWN.

34:01.790 --> 34:02.825
- WHAT?
[upbeat music plays]

34:02.930 --> 34:05.376

IF IT'S THIS WINE,

34:05.490 --> 34:06.821
BUT SUDDENLY I'M NOT FEELING
SO WELL.

34:06.940 --> 34:08.623
CAN YOU FEEL MY FOREHEAD?
- HE'S TURNING INTO THE HULK.

34:08.730 --> 34:11.312
- YOU KNOW WHAT
HE'S COMING DOWN WITH?

34:11.420 --> 34:12.489
- OH, I THINK I--
- HAVE YOU GOT A FEVER?

34:12.600 --> 34:14.522
- I THINK I MIGHT BE COMING DOWN
WITH SOME FEVER!

34:14.630 --> 34:15.972

I'M IN BOSTON.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.594
THE ELEVATOR IN THE BUILDING
MAKES THIS WEIRD NOISE.

- WELL, UM, WHY DON'T YOU GO
WAKE UP YOUR DAD?

40:09.300 --> 40:10.574

WOULD WANNA KNOW.

40:36.710 --> 40:37.938
GRANDMA AND GRANDPA'S DOESN'T
HAVE AN ELEVATOR,

40:38.050 --> 40:40.154
BUT THEY HAVE
THOSE CREAKY OLD STAIRS.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.296
THEY USED TO WAKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

40:42.400 --> 40:45.608
WITH SCARY NOISES.
- REALLY?

40:45.710 --> 40:47.985

WHO WAS REALLY SCARED?

40:48.100 --> 40:51.649
YOUR UNCLE CROSBY.

40:51.750 --> 40:55.299
HE WOULD RUN INTO MY ROOM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

40:55.410 --> 40:58.447
CONVINCED THAT SOMETHING WAS
COMING UP THE STAIRS TO GET HIM.

40:58.550 --> 41:03.271
SO ONE NIGHT,
WE SET UP A BOOBY TRAP.

41:03.390 --> 41:05.142
AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE
HAD GONE TO SLEEP,

41:05.250 --> 41:08.310
WE STRUNG DENTAL FLOSS ACROSS
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

41:08.430 --> 41:10.569
NOTHING WAS GONNA GET PAST US.

41:10.670 --> 41:14.538
AND YOU KNOW,
WE DID CATCH SOMETHING.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.494
YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAUGHT?

41:16.610 --> 41:19.602
YOUR GRANDPA.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.575
HE BROKE HIS NOSE.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.717
HE GROUNDED US FOR THREE WEEKS.

41:26.790 --> 41:28.951
AND, SWEETIE, YOU KNOW...

41:29.070 --> 41:32.130
IT GOT LESS SCARY.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.869
AND ALL OF THIS WILL TOO.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.764
VICTOR?

41:44.530 --> 41:45.906
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART.

41:46.020 --> 41:49.877
[gentle folk song]
