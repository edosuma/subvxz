32:19.020 --> 32:21.815
I've had my fair share

38:00.403 --> 38:02.197
flirting like crazy

your dad when...

38:17.879 --> 38:19.923
And, you know,
the only reason I was there

38:20.006 --> 38:23.301
was because Whitney was
looking at colleges, and I...

Petra called me
to interview me about Noah,

[indistinct chatter]

55:51.473 --> 55:53.475
Excuse me.

55:53.559 --> 55:54.476
‐Okay, so you're on the flight.
‐[Whitney] Hello.

55:54.560 --> 55:56.645
I wasn't able
to get you seats together,

55:56.728 --> 55:57.980
‐but you are on.
‐Hi. Excuse me. I‐I'm sorry.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.356
‐We talked about this earlier.
‐Oh, yes, sir, you are also

55:59.439 --> 56:00.857
‐on the list. I'm gonna check...
‐Excuse me, I'm actually...

56:00.941 --> 56:02.150
‐Excuse... Excuse me! Sorry.
‐One second. Give me a moment.

56:02.234 --> 56:05.404
‐Excuse me.
‐Hi. Uh, four hours ago,

56:05.487 --> 56:06.446
you stood right there
and promised me

56:06.530 --> 56:08.282
that I would have a seat
on this flight,

56:08.365 --> 56:09.241
and now I don't see my name,
so how are we gonna

56:09.324 --> 56:11.326
‐solve this problem?
‐I am so sorry.

56:11.410 --> 56:13.412
‐What's your name?
‐Audrey Nelson.

56:13.495 --> 56:16.206
‐Let me take a look, Ms. Nelson.
‐Thank you.

56:17.833 --> 56:19.209
[Audrey sighs]

56:19.876 --> 56:22.796
Sorry.

56:22.879 --> 56:25.591
Sorry. Sorry.

56:25.674 --> 56:27.634
Sorry.
[chuckles softly]

56:27.718 --> 56:29.011
Sorry.

56:30.012 --> 56:31.138
Sorry.

56:31.221 --> 56:32.556
[Audrey]
Why are you sorry?

56:34.099 --> 56:36.685
[chuckles]
Oh, sorry.

57:55.263 --> 57:55.597
Hey.

57:58.141 --> 57:59.685
You're Audrey Nelson, right?

57:59.768 --> 58:01.603
Yeah. Hey.

58:01.687 --> 58:02.187
We went to school
together, right?

58:02.270 --> 58:05.774
I'm Whitney... Solloway.

58:07.484 --> 58:08.652
Noah's my dad.

58:11.029 --> 58:12.864
[chuckles]
Hey.

58:12.948 --> 58:14.616
I have an aisle seat in 23.

58:14.700 --> 58:16.868
Do you want to switch?
We'd love to catch up.

58:16.952 --> 58:19.246
Sure.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.539
You girls have fun.

58:20.622 --> 58:22.249
[seat belt clicks]

58:28.004 --> 58:30.424
[scoffs] So, should I
tell the air marshal

58:30.507 --> 58:32.092
to be on standby or...?

58:32.175 --> 58:33.260
[chuckles]
No. You're hilarious.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.387
Hey, I was just actually
catching up with you on Twitter.

58:35.470 --> 58:37.472
Congrats on the new memoir,
by the way.

58:37.556 --> 58:40.600
And, um, I just wanted
to say hi to the woman

58:40.684 --> 58:42.060
who's ruining
my family's life.

58:44.312 --> 58:46.940
Uh, wow.
[stifled laugh]

58:47.023 --> 58:49.901
I was joking, but maybe
I should call the air marshal.

58:51.820 --> 58:54.030
Look, here's the thing.

58:54.114 --> 58:55.699
I have three siblings in school.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.659
My mom's second husband
just died of pancreatic cancer.

58:57.743 --> 59:01.079
My mom's dad has Alzheimer's.
My mom hasn't worked

59:01.163 --> 59:03.039
in ten years
so that she could raise us.

59:03.123 --> 59:06.084
So we were all kind of counting
on my dad's book to come out.

59:06.168 --> 59:08.462
You know, so my siblings
could stay in school.

59:11.131 --> 59:13.967
Um, that's a lot.

59:14.050 --> 59:16.219
Yeah. And I bet you
never even bothered

59:16.303 --> 59:17.846
to check whether he had kids

59:17.929 --> 59:19.723
before speaking out
against him, did you?

59:23.518 --> 59:24.269
Actually, I knew
he had children.

59:24.352 --> 59:27.439
Did you ever stop to think

59:27.522 --> 59:30.275
how this might affect
other people, besides my father?

59:35.363 --> 59:36.948
Yes, Whitney.

59:37.032 --> 59:38.950
I thought about it
long and hard,

59:39.034 --> 59:41.620
and I decided
that it was worth it.

59:41.703 --> 59:42.871
Wow.

59:42.954 --> 59:45.499
Look, I worshipped your father.

59:45.582 --> 59:48.502
Okay? All I ever wanted
was to be a writer,

59:48.585 --> 59:49.753
and I'd read <i>Descent,</i>
like, a dozen times,

59:49.836 --> 59:54.633
so getting to study
with Noah Solloway was a dream.

59:54.716 --> 59:56.802
So you're mad at my father
because he didn't live up

59:56.885 --> 59:58.345
to your fantasies of him?

59:58.428 --> 1:00:00.305
No, that's not it.

1:00:00.388 --> 1:00:03.016
So, what is it, Audrey?
He didn't like your work?

1:00:03.099 --> 1:00:05.477
He didn't even give
my writing a chance.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.479
He took one look at me
and decided he knew

1:00:07.562 --> 1:00:10.315
how much I was worth before
he'd read a thing I'd written.

1:00:10.398 --> 1:00:11.900
Why would he do that?

1:00:13.401 --> 1:00:14.694
Because he didn't
respect me, Whitney.

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:17.572
Well, maybe your writing
just wasn't very good.

1:00:17.656 --> 1:00:19.199
Did you ever consider that?

1:00:19.282 --> 1:00:21.243
[laughs]

1:00:23.078 --> 1:00:24.704
Yeah, yeah. You're right.

1:00:24.788 --> 1:00:28.375
At the time,
it‐it really wasn't.

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:30.710
I was very young
when I was in Noah's class,

1:00:30.794 --> 1:00:32.712
and I was honestly desperate
for his guidance,

1:00:32.796 --> 1:00:37.926
but he didn't evaluate my work;
he evaluated me.

1:00:38.009 --> 1:00:39.261
He told me that I had
no inner life.

1:00:39.344 --> 1:00:41.805
Well, do you?

1:00:42.514 --> 1:00:44.766
Everyone has an inner life.

1:00:44.850 --> 1:00:50.063
What he meant was that
I didn't share his inner life

1:00:50.146 --> 1:00:53.066
and that I wasn't trying
hard enough to hide that.

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:58.363
So, because I was writing about
being young and being female,

1:00:58.446 --> 1:01:01.575
he assumed that I had
nothing interesting to say.

1:01:01.658 --> 1:01:04.703
Have you ever experienced that?

1:01:06.538 --> 1:01:08.915
I mean, look, it just sounds
like he was a shitty professor,

1:01:08.999 --> 1:01:10.041
and I'm sorry
that he hurt your feelings,

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:12.335
but that's not a reason
to ruin his entire career.

1:01:12.419 --> 1:01:14.921
‐It's not?
‐No.

1:01:15.005 --> 1:01:17.090
Why not?

1:01:17.966 --> 1:01:20.468
Why didn't you just
drop the class?

1:01:20.552 --> 1:01:24.890
I did. Well, actually, first,
I complained to my dean,

1:01:24.973 --> 1:01:27.601
who told me that I needed
to grow a thicker skin.

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:29.311
So, then I dropped the class.

1:01:29.394 --> 1:01:32.439
And it was a class
that I needed for my major,

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:34.441
so I dropped that, too.

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:38.361
And I stopped writing
for three years,

1:01:38.445 --> 1:01:41.281
and I went into
a pretty serious depression.

1:01:41.364 --> 1:01:43.950
That's terrible, Audrey, but
that's not my father's fault.

1:01:45.869 --> 1:01:47.746
So, whose fault is it?

1:01:47.829 --> 1:01:48.705
I don't know.

1:01:48.788 --> 1:01:51.249
I don't think
it's anybody's fault.

1:01:51.333 --> 1:01:53.043
I think it's just
something that happened.

1:01:54.169 --> 1:01:56.254
Right. Okay, right.

1:01:56.338 --> 1:01:59.257
That is exactly what
I thought, too, at the time.

1:01:59.341 --> 1:02:04.304
But the truth is that the way
that Noah spoke to me,

1:02:04.387 --> 1:02:05.680
the way that he treated me

1:02:05.764 --> 1:02:11.603
confirmed my own worst fears
about myself.

1:02:11.686 --> 1:02:14.898
Things that I had heard in one
way or another my entire life.

1:02:14.981 --> 1:02:16.858
That I was worthless

1:02:16.942 --> 1:02:20.946
and stupid and not hot enough,

1:02:21.029 --> 1:02:24.866
just generally a waste of space.

1:02:24.950 --> 1:02:27.869
And it really wasn't until
I started writing my memoir

1:02:27.953 --> 1:02:30.705
that I even began to ask myself,

1:02:30.789 --> 1:02:35.627
"Okay, why have I thought
this way all this time?

1:02:35.710 --> 1:02:38.505
Why did I just assume
that the problem is me?

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:41.758
Why do I have to
leave the class?

1:02:41.841 --> 1:02:46.471
And why is the way that Noah
treated me considered normal?"

1:02:46.554 --> 1:02:49.099
Think about it, Whitney, okay?

1:02:49.182 --> 1:02:54.187
We give men like him
such unbelievable rope.

1:02:54.270 --> 1:02:56.648
We will do anything‐‐

1:02:56.731 --> 1:02:59.317
anything‐‐ to protect their egos

1:02:59.401 --> 1:03:03.196
when they continuously
and carelessly destroy ours

1:03:03.279 --> 1:03:04.614
without consequence.

1:03:04.698 --> 1:03:07.033
I mean, why? Why does it
have to be like that?

1:03:07.117 --> 1:03:08.618
I agree.

1:03:08.702 --> 1:03:11.204
The world is a shitty place,
and it's not fair.

1:03:11.287 --> 1:03:13.790
But I still feel like
you're using your private beef

1:03:13.873 --> 1:03:14.874
with my father
to promote your book sales,

1:03:14.958 --> 1:03:18.753
and that's just...
that's fucking bullshit.

1:03:20.964 --> 1:03:22.382
Wow.

1:03:24.175 --> 1:03:26.094
Someone really did
a number on you.

1:03:27.429 --> 1:03:29.347
Look, I've had tough experiences

1:03:29.431 --> 1:03:31.433
with older men, too‐‐
teachers, bosses‐‐

1:03:31.516 --> 1:03:33.518
but I'm adult enough to admit
that sometimes the problem

1:03:33.601 --> 1:03:35.937
was just that I wanted to
fuck them and I shouldn't have.

1:03:36.021 --> 1:03:38.106
Or I wanted them to fuck me
and they didn't.

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:39.774
Or maybe it's just
that sometimes,

1:03:39.858 --> 1:03:41.526
relationships
between men and women

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:43.903
get weird and awkward,
and that's normal.

1:03:43.987 --> 1:03:45.280
But that doesn't mean
all men should burn.

1:03:45.363 --> 1:03:48.908
Mm‐hmm. Okay.

1:03:48.992 --> 1:03:52.162
I wanted to sleep with your dad.
You're right.

1:03:52.245 --> 1:03:55.832
And, yeah, he didn't want
to sleep with me back,

1:03:55.915 --> 1:03:57.208
and that hurt my feelings.

1:03:57.292 --> 1:04:01.713
But, Whitney, when you want
to sleep with these older guys,

1:04:01.796 --> 1:04:05.216
ask yourself, like, what are you
really attracted to?

1:04:05.300 --> 1:04:08.386
Is it them,
or is it their power

1:04:08.470 --> 1:04:11.723
and their authority,
their agency in the world?

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:14.517
Like, how they can get
the kind of shit done

1:04:14.601 --> 1:04:16.102
that you can only dream of,
and they do it

1:04:16.186 --> 1:04:19.314
without even breaking a sweat
because the world

1:04:19.397 --> 1:04:22.400
just offers itself up to them
on a silver platter.

1:04:22.484 --> 1:04:25.278
Ask yourself,
do you really want to fuck them,

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:27.489
or do you want to be them?

1:04:33.078 --> 1:04:35.246
Look, I'm sorry
about your family.

1:04:35.330 --> 1:04:37.165
I really am.

1:04:37.248 --> 1:04:38.958
And, yeah,

1:04:39.042 --> 1:04:41.795
I‐I considered not speaking up
for this very reason,

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:44.380
'cause I thought...
[sighs]

1:04:44.464 --> 1:04:48.093
"God, what if my individual
trauma is not worth blowing up

1:04:48.176 --> 1:04:49.552
anyone else's life
in order to tell?"

1:04:49.636 --> 1:04:52.722
But if we all do that,

1:04:52.806 --> 1:04:56.601
if we all think like that,

1:04:56.684 --> 1:04:59.771
then none of these stories
are ever gonna get told.

1:04:59.854 --> 1:05:03.650
So, when does it become enough?

1:05:03.733 --> 1:05:05.610
When does our need
to tell our stories

1:05:05.693 --> 1:05:08.279
become greater than their need

1:05:08.363 --> 1:05:10.031
to preserve
the status quo?

1:05:10.115 --> 1:05:12.450
Is it when we're abused
or when we're raped?

1:05:12.534 --> 1:05:13.785
Or is that even enough?

1:05:13.868 --> 1:05:16.162
Because, honestly, it depends
on the man in question, right?

1:05:18.540 --> 1:05:21.126
Really, what I'm saying
is that this is the problem.

1:05:21.209 --> 1:05:26.297
We constantly debate whether
we even have the right to speak.

1:05:26.381 --> 1:05:29.884
Like, we, we monitor what we say
and our choice of words.

1:05:29.968 --> 1:05:32.804
And, oh, are we sitting,
or are we standing?

1:05:32.887 --> 1:05:34.222
And, oh, we're...
if we're sitting,

1:05:34.305 --> 1:05:35.807
well, how are we sitting?

1:05:35.890 --> 1:05:38.017
And if we're standing,
well, what are we wearing?

1:05:38.101 --> 1:05:39.602
And are our voices
pitched just right?

1:05:39.686 --> 1:05:40.770
I mean, think about
the mental gymnastics

1:05:40.854 --> 1:05:44.023
that you have to do in order
to just have a conversation.

1:05:44.107 --> 1:05:46.192
And now imagine
what it would be like

1:05:46.276 --> 1:05:49.279
if we lived in a world where we
didn't have to do any of that.

1:05:49.362 --> 1:05:51.823
Where we can just speak.

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:54.993
We're not the problem, Whitney.

1:05:55.076 --> 1:05:56.286
They are.

1:05:56.369 --> 1:05:59.998
All I want is just
to live in a world

1:06:00.081 --> 1:06:02.667
where we're not, like,
weird second‐class citizens

1:06:02.750 --> 1:06:05.420
whose first job is
to make men comfortable,

1:06:05.503 --> 1:06:08.214
and then we'll be
allowed to speak.

1:06:08.298 --> 1:06:09.883
[sighs]

1:06:12.427 --> 1:06:14.721
And, yeah, I think
that your dad is

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:18.516
an impediment to that world.

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:21.686
And from what I read
in that article,

1:06:21.769 --> 1:06:24.772
I'm not the only one.
