00:02.797 --> 00:06.665
So this homeless guy, all he
took was a can of dog food?

00:06.667 --> 00:07.566
That's it.

00:07.568 --> 00:09.368
Did he have a dog with him?

00:09.370 --> 00:11.937
Not that I saw.

00:11.939 --> 00:14.139
The guy must live in the woods.

00:14.141 --> 00:16.274
So the mutt's probably
out there with him.

00:16.277 --> 00:19.311
And you say this is the
second time he's showed up?

00:19.313 --> 00:22.815
Came in last week.
Shoplifted that time, too.

00:22.817 --> 00:23.883
Dog food.

00:23.885 --> 00:24.817
Didn't notice.

00:24.819 --> 00:27.420
Figured the poor S.O.B. was hungry,
so I let him go.

00:27.473 --> 00:29.955
But when he turned up again today...

00:29.957 --> 00:32.659
Wonder what they put in these
to make them taste so good.

00:32.861 --> 00:35.628

great news. Thank you.

02:40.121 --> 02:41.120

02:41.122 --> 02:43.122
Yes!

02:43.924 --> 02:46.392
Am I interrupting a private moment?

02:46.394 --> 02:49.228
That was the director of the assisted
care home where my mother lives.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.629
And?

02:50.631 --> 02:52.331
I kept quiet because I
didn't want to jinx it,

02:52.333 --> 02:54.333
but there's a groundbreaking
clinical study on Alzheimer's

02:54.335 --> 02:56.268
at Johns Hopkins next
month, and I just found out

02:56.270 --> 02:58.137
that my mom's gonna be one of
the participants. She got in.

02:58.139 --> 03:00.305
That's great news, Spencer.

03:00.307 --> 03:02.508
It's huge. The program's
called metabolic enhancement

03:02.510 --> 03:04.877
for neuro-degeneration, and results
from earlier tests are hopeful,

03:04.879 --> 03:07.813
not just to slow the disease
but to actually reverse it.

03:07.815 --> 03:08.981
Yaah ha ha ha ha!

03:08.983 --> 03:10.382
Ok, it's customary
that the lottery winner

03:10.384 --> 03:13.118

with the rest of the office.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.087
Well, Reid's news is
even better than that.

03:15.089 --> 03:18.757
Oh. I can't wait to hear,
but right now we got a case.

03:18.759 --> 03:21.226

03:23.531 --> 03:28.600
Ok, so for those of us who
kvetch about our A.M. commute,

03:28.602 --> 03:30.135
this will put it in perspective.

03:30.137 --> 03:33.405
This A.M. a Virginia
State Trooper discovered

03:33.407 --> 03:35.107
a bag of dismembered body parts.

03:35.109 --> 03:37.309
They were with a
homeless man's belongings.

03:37.311 --> 03:40.746
That homeless man then
fled into the mountains.

03:40.748 --> 03:43.549
The Appalachian Trail.

03:44.385 --> 03:47.486
Am I, uh, missing something?

03:47.488 --> 03:49.788
We had a case in the same
general area 6 years ago.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.056
The unsub was never caught.

03:51.058 --> 03:52.791
That guy was a pedophile.

03:52.793 --> 03:54.526
Do the body parts in
Virginia belong to a child?

03:54.528 --> 03:55.663
They do not.

03:55.730 --> 03:58.197
Well, if there's a silver lining
in this, that would qualify.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.699
The trail does have some history.

04:00.701 --> 04:03.402
In the early 1980s, Randall Lee
Smith killed two hikers there.

04:03.404 --> 04:04.937
He served 15 years, got released,

04:04.939 --> 04:07.977
then went back to the exact same spot
and tried to kill two more people.

04:07.977 --> 04:09.842
Maybe there's something in the water.

04:09.924 --> 04:13.746
Saving body parts is like
collecting souvenirs, right?

04:13.748 --> 04:16.415
That's one possibility. It could
also be a forensic countermeasure.

04:16.416 --> 04:18.350
Or he's keeping them as trophies.

04:18.351 --> 04:20.486
Well, homeless people often suffer from

04:20.488 --> 04:22.521
crippling mental illness.
I mean, is it possible

04:22.523 --> 04:24.923
he stumbled across the body
and then collected the limbs?

04:24.925 --> 04:25.958
Rossi: You mean like a hoarder.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.959
Yeah, maybe.

04:26.961 --> 04:29.161
Compulsive irrational
gathering of objects

04:29.163 --> 04:31.864
is a common psychosis among
the long-term homeless.

04:31.866 --> 04:33.766
Flushing people out of
terrain like this is tough.

04:33.768 --> 04:35.234
I mean really tough.

04:35.236 --> 04:37.202
We all know that Eric
Rudolph evaded capture

04:37.204 --> 04:40.005
in this same wilderness
for over 5 years.

04:40.007 --> 04:41.907
Preliminary M.E. report...

04:41.909 --> 04:46.311
The body parts came from at
least 5 different victims.

04:46.313 --> 04:47.679
Well, that settles that.

04:47.681 --> 04:50.015
The unsub didn't stumble on anything.

04:50.017 --> 04:51.016
He's serial.

04:51.018 --> 04:52.785
This happened less than 90 miles away.

04:52.787 --> 04:54.153
It'll be quicker to drive.

04:54.155 --> 04:56.088
Our local M.E. isn't
equipped to handle all this,

04:56.090 --> 04:58.924
so the body parts are being
sent to the coroner here.

06:28.801 --> 06:32.202
Did you shut down the trails
in and out of the area?

06:32.204 --> 06:33.537
Yes, Sir, like you asked.

06:33.539 --> 06:36.039
Thing is, all that guy had to do

06:36.041 --> 06:39.009
was cross country over any
one of these hills off trail

06:39.011 --> 06:41.111
and he's gone. Easy as pie.

06:41.113 --> 06:42.779
Lewis: It's as much about sealing him in

06:42.781 --> 06:45.115
as keeping other potential victims out.

06:45.117 --> 06:46.783
How far in did your officers search?

06:46.785 --> 06:49.920
Half mile in every direction.

07:03.068 --> 07:05.569

07:05.571 --> 07:09.139
He's likely targeting lone
hikers passing through.

07:09.141 --> 07:10.507
And that means the victims

07:10.509 --> 07:12.108
could be from anywhere. A missing hiker

07:12.110 --> 07:13.410
wouldn't be noticed for quite a while.

07:13.412 --> 07:15.479
Any update from Alvez?

07:15.481 --> 07:18.248
Well, he's on his way with the
search dogs, but I'll check his ETA.

07:36.768 --> 07:38.535

07:38.537 --> 07:40.370
He knew exactly what he wanted.

07:40.372 --> 07:43.340
He didn't even try to
pretend he wasn't stealing.

07:43.342 --> 07:46.810
I mean, at least stick
it under your coat.

07:46.812 --> 07:48.011

07:48.013 --> 07:49.412

07:49.414 --> 07:51.114

07:51.116 --> 07:52.449

07:52.451 --> 07:54.384
You guys are the experts,

Carson found in that bag

08:05.597 --> 08:08.098
may have been the unsub's food source.

08:11.770 --> 08:14.271

08:14.273 --> 08:15.805
all Caucasian.

08:15.807 --> 08:18.341
It makes sense his victim
pool would skew male.

08:18.343 --> 08:20.410
Men are more likely to go
into a remote area alone.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.112
The fact that he also
killed a woman suggests

08:22.114 --> 08:23.513
the unsub doesn't have
a preference at all.

08:23.515 --> 08:25.215
These are victims of opportunity.

08:25.217 --> 08:26.750
Any estimates on their ages?

08:26.752 --> 08:28.752
Well, the men are 40 to 50.

08:28.754 --> 08:31.388
Female was younger. Early to mid-20s.

08:31.390 --> 08:33.789
We'll run DNA, see if we get any hits.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.958
It's a long shot, but
we might get lucky.

The limbs don't appear to be
removed with any skill or precision.

08:38.597 --> 08:41.398

hatchet job, literally.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.732
What about cause of death?

08:42.734 --> 08:44.367
I mean, granted, being
hacked into pieces

08:44.369 --> 08:45.535
would do the trick, but...

08:45.537 --> 08:48.271
You know, without the full corpse
it's almost impossible to tell.

08:48.273 --> 08:49.773
And the tox screen on the female showed

08:49.775 --> 08:51.408
no drugs or poison in her system.

08:51.410 --> 08:52.742
Do we know how long
ago they were killed?

08:52.744 --> 08:55.845
Difficult to pinpoint given
the exposure to the elements.

08:55.847 --> 08:59.382
But one set of limbs was a
lot older than the others.

08:59.384 --> 09:01.351
Almost a year, year and a half.

09:01.353 --> 09:03.420
Best guess on the other 3 males,

09:03.422 --> 09:06.890
8 months, 5 months, 2 months.

09:06.892 --> 09:08.792

Your name's not Roger.

11:51.790 --> 11:54.424
Ok, so to abduct, kill, and dispose

11:54.426 --> 11:57.927
of that many victims, it
takes skill and sophistication.

like he would have a hard time

Well, maybe he has periods of
intense focus before decompensating.

12:06.037 --> 12:08.738
Though the disorganized
nature of the crime scene

12:08.740 --> 12:10.106
seems to fight that theory.

12:10.108 --> 12:12.942
So we're looking at another
person here? A team, maybe?

12:12.944 --> 12:16.012
Oh, a team, you'd need
planning and coordination.

12:16.014 --> 12:19.182
You'd still have to pass
the tie your shoelaces test,

12:19.184 --> 12:21.151

12:21.153 --> 12:23.953
Well, maybe it's what
Lewis said earlier.

12:23.955 --> 12:25.955
The homeless man just
stumbled upon the body,

12:25.957 --> 12:29.993
except what he stumbled upon
was a mass burial ground.

12:32.697 --> 12:34.497
Well, this backpack is brand-new.

Thanks. I'll take that for you.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.551

trophies, right? Souvenirs?

12:54.553 --> 12:55.852
Yeah, that's right.

Why would he suddenly go
full Johnny Appleseed on us,

12:57.923 --> 12:59.589

It's a burger place over in Dillon.

How far is that from here?

14:00.377 --> 14:01.910
By car, 10 miles or so.

14:01.912 --> 14:04.212
But as the crow flies over that ridge,

14:04.214 --> 14:07.048
it's real close. Two miles, max.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.712
If we flushed the
unsub out of the woods,

14:08.712 --> 14:09.985
he may have headed to town.

14:10.082 --> 14:12.787
Why don't you and Lewis
drive to Dillon, check it out.

remains were about a week old.

If she surprised the unsub
in the midst of a kill,

16:03.467 --> 16:05.567
it would explain why
she was the anomaly.

16:05.569 --> 16:07.335
She wasn't targeted
like the other victims.

16:07.337 --> 16:09.871
She was a witness who
had to be silenced.

16:09.873 --> 16:12.974
Which means our initial
profile was incorrect.

after hours dumpster diving.

Come on, let's go. [Whistles]

23:24.353 --> 23:26.620
Did you see this guy's
body language with Roxy?

23:26.622 --> 23:29.322
Hard to miss. He didn't want
that dog anywhere near him.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.024
Did we check the leash
he had for canine DNA?

23:31.026 --> 23:32.559
I don't think so.

23:32.561 --> 23:35.295
We'd better. 100 bucks
says there's nothing on it.

23:35.297 --> 23:38.965
I know. This whole dog
business is in his head.

23:38.967 --> 23:40.834
It's a delusion.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.036
But I still think Cormac is real.

23:43.038 --> 23:45.272
Think about what Todd said.

23:45.274 --> 23:48.608
He was small, then
big. Younger than him.

23:48.610 --> 23:50.010
Named by somebody else.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.411
He's talking about a person.

23:51.413 --> 23:53.079
Probably someone he grew up with.

23:53.081 --> 23:56.283
A family member could elicit
that level of devotion, huh?

23:56.285 --> 23:58.084
A little brother, maybe.

23:58.086 --> 24:00.287
Ok, sit tight.
I'm gonna get Garcia on this.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.158
Good job.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.293
Bueno.

24:06.295 --> 24:07.861
Todd and Cormac Burton,

24:07.863 --> 24:11.465
sons of the late Amy and Curtis
Burton of Dillon, Virginia.

24:11.467 --> 24:12.966
Is there an address?

24:12.968 --> 24:14.734
Uh, 55 Spring Mill Road.

24:14.736 --> 24:16.269
I don't think anyone lives there.

24:16.271 --> 24:18.972
The water and the electricity
were turned off over a year ago.

24:18.974 --> 24:20.540
Rossi, I think I've got something.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.975
Thanks, Emily.

24:21.977 --> 24:26.446
Spring Mill Road is right here.

24:26.448 --> 24:28.181
It's a long way from town.

24:28.183 --> 24:29.850
Technically they're still
inside the city limits,

24:29.852 --> 24:32.452
but, yeah, it's definitely
out in the boonies.

24:32.454 --> 24:34.454
Without a vehicle, there's no way Todd

24:34.456 --> 24:36.423
could have taken Howard Walker there.

24:36.425 --> 24:38.658
JJ, accompany Trooper Carson's

24:38.660 --> 24:40.494
officers and search
the premises, anyway.

24:40.496 --> 24:42.796
All right.

24:42.798 --> 24:45.131
The report you requested
is almost ready.

24:45.133 --> 24:47.334
And forensics said you're
gonna come pick this up as well.

24:47.336 --> 24:48.502
Reid: Thank you.

24:48.504 --> 24:50.337
I understand you've
identified the remains

24:50.339 --> 24:51.438
of the female victim.

24:51.455 --> 24:53.240
We're fairly certain it's Kylie Fleming,

24:53.242 --> 24:54.708
but we're waiting on DNA
samples from her family.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.610
What do we know about
the latest two victims?

24:56.612 --> 24:58.245
Same as the first 4.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.747
White males, age roughly 40 to 50.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.649
Both sets of remains around a month old.

25:02.651 --> 25:06.119
Anyway, your report should
be ready. Let me go check.

25:15.340 --> 25:16.935
So, uh, the Burton house is abandoned.

25:16.935 --> 25:20.436
There was a stockpile of canned food
and bottled water in the back, though.

25:20.436 --> 25:23.377
We figured that Todd would come
into town from time to time.

25:23.377 --> 25:25.917
That's probably where he holed up.

25:26.656 --> 25:29.093
Garcia, do you have any more
information on the Burton family?

25:29.093 --> 25:30.792
Yes, I do, and it's all super sad.

25:30.794 --> 25:34.163
So, mother Amy died of
cirrhosis of the liver,

25:34.165 --> 25:36.231
like literally drank herself to death.

25:36.233 --> 25:39.401
Which, the more you learn
about father, Curtis,

25:39.403 --> 25:41.069
it makes sense,

25:41.071 --> 25:44.373
'cause he regularly beat
her and both of the boys,

25:44.375 --> 25:46.842
and then he dropped dead of a
heart attack about a year ago.

25:46.844 --> 25:48.944
What happened to the boys
once they left the house?

25:48.946 --> 25:50.579
Todd stayed in Dillon.

25:50.581 --> 25:53.515
He lived on the streets,
started doing drugs.

25:53.517 --> 25:57.486
4 years later, little
brother Cormac turned 18

25:57.488 --> 26:01.423
and he moved to Luray.
He just skedaddled,

26:01.425 --> 26:03.025
clear on the other side of the state.

26:03.027 --> 26:05.060
Did Cormac have the
same problems as Todd?

26:05.062 --> 26:07.529
No, he didn't. He worked
at a sporting goods store.

26:07.531 --> 26:09.498
Kept to himself. No wife or kids.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.465
Here's what's weird.

26:10.467 --> 26:13.669
As soon as his dad Curtis died,

26:13.671 --> 26:17.172
Cormac dropped everything in Luray
and came right back to Dillon.

26:17.174 --> 26:19.608
But then he disappeared. Poof.

26:19.610 --> 26:21.076
Rossi: When was he last seen?

26:21.078 --> 26:23.278
Visually documented seen?

26:23.280 --> 26:26.848
Uh, when he got a driver's
license 14 months ago.

26:27.952 --> 26:30.052
A classic case of transference.

26:30.054 --> 26:32.087
Timing works out. Cormac the dog,

26:32.089 --> 26:33.755
Cormac the brother.

26:33.757 --> 26:36.325
[Cell phone rings]

26:36.327 --> 26:37.392
Hey, Rossi, what's up?

26:37.394 --> 26:40.629
Pull another DNA sample
from John Doe number one.

26:40.631 --> 26:42.130
We tried, but the
remains are too degraded.

26:42.132 --> 26:43.599
Well, you need to try again.

26:43.601 --> 26:46.068
All right, I'll have the M.E.
take a second sample, but why?

26:46.070 --> 26:49.137
Cormac disappeared
shortly after leaving Luray

26:49.139 --> 26:51.273
and returning to Dillon.

26:51.275 --> 26:53.875
The last known sighting
of him was 14 months ago.

26:53.877 --> 26:56.878
14 months? That's about how long
ago John Doe number one was killed.

26:56.880 --> 27:01.683
Exactly. Cormac might have
been Todd's first victim.

27:02.788 --> 27:06.274
_

27:11.410 --> 27:14.077
Cormac Burton in better days.

27:14.079 --> 27:16.580
But Todd's delusion
sounds to me like remorse.

27:17.441 --> 27:19.975
He tried to psychologically
undo what he's done,

27:19.977 --> 27:23.078
but if he harbored this kind
of anger against his brother,

27:23.080 --> 27:25.213
why wait so long to act?

27:25.215 --> 27:27.015
Out of sight, out of mind.

27:27.017 --> 27:29.551
Cormac was off at Luray for 10 years.

27:29.553 --> 27:31.686
His move back to Dillon was the trigger.

27:31.688 --> 27:34.423
Well, if Cormac tried to take
possession of the family home,

27:34.425 --> 27:37.793
maybe Todd murdered him for
something as simple as greed.

27:37.795 --> 27:40.362
It all makes sense except for one thing.

27:40.364 --> 27:45.233
Why would Todd keep on
killing if Cormac was dead?

27:46.182 --> 27:48.761
Trooper Carson, did you have any
pets when you were growing up?

27:48.906 --> 27:52.922
Pets? Yeah. Had a hamster named Fred.

27:53.810 --> 27:55.177
Were you fond of it?

27:55.250 --> 27:57.750
Well, yeah. I loved
that furry little guy.

27:57.752 --> 27:59.585
So it never would have crossed your mind

27:59.587 --> 28:01.454
to take care of him, take a break,

28:01.456 --> 28:02.788
and then take care of him again?

28:02.790 --> 28:05.892
Oh, of course not. No.

28:06.432 --> 28:09.573
I didn't think so.
You up for a road trip?

28:09.706 --> 28:12.207
You kidding me? I pack a
toothbrush to go to the post office.

28:12.209 --> 28:13.208
Where to?

28:13.210 --> 28:14.676
Luray, Virginia.

28:26.390 --> 28:30.625

28:50.650 --> 28:52.016
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

28:52.018 --> 28:54.152
You looked like you were sleeping.

28:54.154 --> 28:56.053
Thank you.

28:56.055 --> 28:58.256
I heard about your mom.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.724
Spencer, I'm so sorry.

28:59.726 --> 29:01.659
It's ok. Luckily
there's a clinical trial

29:01.661 --> 29:04.428
at Johns Hopkins. It's
happening at just the right time.

29:04.430 --> 29:06.430
I'm headed to the
crime scene, all right?

29:06.432 --> 29:08.065
He's all yours, Prentiss.

29:08.067 --> 29:10.401
We're thinking now that Todd did Cormac?

29:10.403 --> 29:11.669
Timeline works out.

29:11.671 --> 29:13.304
Brother against brother. That's tough.

29:13.306 --> 29:14.705
Well, according to the Bible, fratricide

29:14.707 --> 29:17.308
was the first type of
murder ever committed.

29:17.310 --> 29:20.344
That's interesting. Um, anyhow,

29:20.346 --> 29:22.747
he's as clear-headed as
he's been. I'd jump on it.

29:22.749 --> 29:24.048
Ok.

29:24.050 --> 29:25.950
Hey.

29:25.952 --> 29:28.753
We'll talk later, ok?

29:34.928 --> 29:37.461
What do you say?

29:38.997 --> 29:40.465
Let's find Cormac together.

29:41.300 --> 29:43.501
I don't want to talk about him anymore.

29:44.144 --> 29:46.036
Why not?

29:48.241 --> 29:49.840
Are you angry with him?

29:49.842 --> 29:51.409
No.

29:51.411 --> 29:54.044
- It's ok if you are.
- Well, I'm not.

29:56.214 --> 29:57.773
Did Cormac bite you?

29:57.773 --> 29:59.751
Is that why you're angry?

30:06.858 --> 30:09.058
We found this among your things.

30:13.798 --> 30:16.966
Dad, I'm sorry! No!

30:16.968 --> 30:19.368
He's gonna beat me up.

30:19.370 --> 30:20.536
Get in the back!

30:20.538 --> 30:23.673
Please, Daddy, I'm sorry.

30:23.675 --> 30:26.409
No, Dad! What are you doing?

30:26.411 --> 30:28.978
If you want to act like animals,

30:28.980 --> 30:31.113
I'll treat you like animals.

30:31.115 --> 30:33.349
Animals. Animals.

30:33.351 --> 30:37.086
Ok, all right, what is going on?

30:37.088 --> 30:39.121
Where did you go just now?

30:40.258 --> 30:43.593
He made us live like pigs.

30:43.595 --> 30:45.127
In mud.

30:45.129 --> 30:47.631
Who did?

30:48.333 --> 30:49.466
Daddy.

31:06.251 --> 31:09.218
There are some famous
caverns here, right?

31:09.220 --> 31:12.288
Wouldn't know. I prefer
to stay aboveground.

31:12.724 --> 31:13.950
No, no, no, that's all right, fellas.

31:14.011 --> 31:15.477
You can stay put.

31:15.477 --> 31:17.594
We just want to ask a few questions. Ok?

31:18.030 --> 31:22.900
We're curious if any of you
have seen this guy before?

31:23.176 --> 31:24.669
You mean Time Clock?

31:24.721 --> 31:26.454
- Excuse me?
- Time Clock Todd.

31:26.456 --> 31:28.289
That's what we used to call him.

31:28.291 --> 31:29.457
He ain't dead, is he?

31:29.459 --> 31:30.792
No. He's alive.

31:30.794 --> 31:33.394
That used to be Todd's
spot, right over there.

31:33.396 --> 31:35.196
And how long did he live here?

31:35.198 --> 31:36.864
Oh, hell, a long time.

31:36.866 --> 31:38.399
Years and years.

31:38.401 --> 31:40.001
When is the last time you saw him?

31:41.783 --> 31:43.850
I think it was in the summer.

31:44.524 --> 31:47.024
Not this summer.

31:47.026 --> 31:48.125
Last summer.

31:48.127 --> 31:49.560
You called him Time Clock?

31:49.562 --> 31:51.128
That was a joke name we gave him

31:51.130 --> 31:53.865
on account of he was always
talking about his job.

31:53.867 --> 31:55.967
Wait, he works?

31:55.969 --> 31:58.336
Nah. Don't know where he went to,

31:58.338 --> 32:00.037
but it wasn't a real job.

you said the slaughter?

No.

33:52.496 --> 33:55.898
Todd, what happened to the dog?

34:00.170 --> 34:02.604
We drove the dog up on the hills.

34:02.606 --> 34:04.473
And then what?

34:05.809 --> 34:09.578
We pulled over to the side
of the road and let him out.

34:10.714 --> 34:13.014
Never saw him again.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.018
And your brother?

34:22.560 --> 34:26.628
He was... he was different.

Luray, Todd followed.

34:44.614 --> 34:47.516
That was his job. Todd
was his brother's keeper.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.717
He just wasn't able to give
up his role as protector.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.789
Even when Todd realized he
was protecting a murderer.

34:56.297 --> 34:58.834
Todd's little brother is our unsub.

35:08.924 --> 35:11.257
It won't be much longer.

35:11.828 --> 35:14.128
Almost time for the slaughter.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.408
It makes sense, Rossi,
especially if Cormac

35:23.410 --> 35:25.243
wasn't revisiting his crime scenes.

35:25.245 --> 35:28.413
Got it. Garcia's
pursuing a lead right now.

35:28.415 --> 35:30.415
Ok.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.617
Prentiss is on it.

35:32.619 --> 35:35.520
So Todd must have secretly
witnessed Cormac's killings

35:35.522 --> 35:38.556
and then come back later to cut up
the bodies and hide the evidence.

35:38.558 --> 35:40.091
He failed his little
brother in childhood.

35:40.093 --> 35:42.260
He wasn't about to fail him again.

35:42.262 --> 35:43.294
Where to?

35:43.296 --> 35:44.462
The BAU.

35:46.066 --> 35:47.832
Pigs, pigs, pigs...

35:47.834 --> 35:48.900
Anything yet?

35:48.902 --> 35:51.102
Oh, there aren't any slaughterhouses

35:51.104 --> 35:52.437
or anything porcine-related

35:52.439 --> 35:55.273
within a 100-mile radius of Dillon.

35:55.275 --> 35:58.109
The vegetarian in me approves,
but it doesn't help you at all.

35:58.111 --> 36:00.111
Ok, it could be a meat or butcher shop

36:00.113 --> 36:01.713
or a small farm.

36:01.715 --> 36:02.947
Ok, seriously, do you know

36:02.949 --> 36:05.183
how many mom and pop farms
there are in this area?

36:05.185 --> 36:07.585
Ok, then use the father
as the jumping-off point.

36:07.587 --> 36:10.722
Friends or relatives of Curtis Burton.

36:10.724 --> 36:12.390
You know what? That London fog

36:12.392 --> 36:14.692
didn't cloud your brain
one bit, Emily Prentiss.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.995
Rance Kerley, cousin of Curtis,

36:16.997 --> 36:19.197
two acres of land outside of Dillon

36:19.199 --> 36:21.299
which she raised and sold
pigs to local markets.

36:21.301 --> 36:23.501
Is the farm still operational?

36:23.503 --> 36:27.739
Oh. No. Rance was arrested for
aggravated assault a few years ago

36:27.741 --> 36:29.040
and the place went bankrupt.

36:29.042 --> 36:30.708
Ok, send the address to JJ and Alvez.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.844
- Already sent.
- Of course you did.

36:36.683 --> 36:38.783
Let me go, please.
Why are you doing this?

36:38.785 --> 36:39.784
Shh. Quiet.

36:39.786 --> 36:41.586
I haven't done anything. I swear.

36:41.588 --> 36:43.922
Quiet. Don't try to reason with me.

36:43.924 --> 36:45.723
I'm an animal, remember?

36:45.725 --> 36:47.192
We just do what we do.

36:47.194 --> 36:49.227
Follow our instincts.

36:53.066 --> 36:55.466
Right over there's where you brought us.

36:55.468 --> 36:57.435
[Indistinct]

36:59.372 --> 37:00.538
Remember?

37:00.540 --> 37:04.108
I swear, you've got the wrong person.

37:04.110 --> 37:07.011
In the morning, as soon
as the light got in,

37:07.013 --> 37:09.447
you took the pigs one by one.

37:09.449 --> 37:11.883
[Squealing]

37:23.363 --> 37:25.463
[Whimpers]

37:25.958 --> 37:27.558
Now it's your turn.

37:30.529 --> 37:33.030
Prentiss: FBI! Drop the weapon now!

37:33.032 --> 37:34.298
Alvez: Do it now!

37:42.875 --> 37:45.375
You know what they say
about a cornered animal.

37:51.083 --> 37:53.350
He gives up.

38:07.533 --> 38:09.233
Let's go. Get up.

38:15.407 --> 38:17.708
I have some good news, Todd.

38:17.710 --> 38:19.176
We found Cormac.

38:19.178 --> 38:24.248
He's not lost anymore.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.616
He isn't?

38:25.618 --> 38:27.918
He's safe.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.520
Safe and happy.

38:32.091 --> 38:34.658
How'd you find him?

38:39.365 --> 38:41.532
It was the food you left out.

38:43.636 --> 38:45.869
You saved his life, Todd.

38:45.871 --> 38:48.105
He's safe because of you.

38:53.479 --> 38:55.746
I saved him.

38:58.717 --> 39:01.318
I saved him.

39:10.296 --> 39:12.262
Garcia: Hey, giant
brain. When do you leave?

39:12.264 --> 39:13.797
Tomorrow morning at 7:00.

39:14.867 --> 39:17.501
[Telephone rings]

39:17.503 --> 39:19.603
Bon voyage.

39:19.605 --> 39:20.637
Bye.

39:20.639 --> 39:21.805
Hello?

39:36.422 --> 39:39.756
Hey, clocked a lot of miles
on the old odometer today, huh?

39:39.758 --> 39:41.525
Make a joke about, I don't know,

39:41.527 --> 39:44.661
engines and lubrication,
I'm not interested.

39:44.663 --> 39:45.829
What's that?

39:45.831 --> 39:49.600
This is a mop a janitor gave to me.

39:49.602 --> 39:51.435
You do some late-night cleaning?

39:51.437 --> 39:54.338
No, it's for my dog.

39:54.340 --> 39:57.708
You know, I've gone and I've bought
the $30 designer, sustainable,

39:57.710 --> 39:59.543
made in Tibet, whatever things,

39:59.545 --> 40:01.845
and, uh... Nothing. Zero.

40:01.847 --> 40:04.214
This right here, this is
gonna be fun all night.

40:04.216 --> 40:05.682
Roxy, come on!

40:05.684 --> 40:07.084
[Whistles] Come here. [Whistles]

40:07.086 --> 40:08.585
Roxy's your dog?

40:08.587 --> 40:10.320
Yeah.

40:10.322 --> 40:11.889
Oh, my gosh, this whole
time this is the Roxy,

40:11.891 --> 40:13.991
like the Roxy you said like adores you,

40:13.993 --> 40:16.260
like how could any
female not be, you know,

40:16.262 --> 40:18.762
intoxicated by your masculine wiles.

40:18.764 --> 40:20.564
Yeah, I didn't say it exactly like that.

40:20.566 --> 40:21.765
Yeah, you kind of did.

40:21.767 --> 40:25.369
Oh, my gosh, she's
adorable. Oh, my gosh!

40:25.371 --> 40:26.970
I thought you were talking
about your girlfriend,

40:26.972 --> 40:29.039
you know, I thought you were
being all fatheaded and macho.

40:29.041 --> 40:30.307
I know.

40:30.309 --> 40:32.242
You know?

40:32.244 --> 40:33.777
Yeah.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.612
[Chuckling]

40:35.614 --> 40:38.248
I know you didn't want
to like me at first,

40:38.250 --> 40:40.517
so I figured I'd make it easier on you.

40:40.519 --> 40:43.086
So you profiled me?

40:43.088 --> 40:45.422
Luke Alvez, behavioral analyst.

40:45.424 --> 40:47.691
That's what I do.

40:47.693 --> 40:49.893
All right, well, thank
you for letting me know.

40:49.895 --> 40:51.528
Bye.

40:52.698 --> 40:53.664
You're still here.

40:54.541 --> 40:56.400
Don't you have a suitcase to pack?

40:56.976 --> 40:58.342
I'm not going.

40:59.219 --> 41:00.834
Why not?

41:01.474 --> 41:05.852
The Johns Hopkins clinical trial.
Turns out my mom wasn't chosen.

41:06.140 --> 41:07.606
[Sighs]

41:07.608 --> 41:09.074
I'm sorry, Reid.

41:09.076 --> 41:10.443
What happened?

41:10.480 --> 41:11.746
Budget restraints.

41:11.748 --> 41:14.849
The study had to randomly
reduce the number of participants

41:14.851 --> 41:16.450
and my mom's name was drawn.

41:16.452 --> 41:18.953
Well, you can still go to Vegas.

41:18.955 --> 41:21.589
It's important that I stay here
and try and find something else.

41:21.591 --> 41:25.793
There's a study coming up with Paul
Stanfield at the Anderson clinic in Houston...

41:25.795 --> 41:27.094
Spencer.

41:27.096 --> 41:29.130
I understand you want to help.

41:29.132 --> 41:31.966
But don't lose sight
of the bigger picture.

41:33.660 --> 41:34.994
What do you mean?

41:37.041 --> 41:40.710
You have a finite amount of
time left with your mother.

41:40.712 --> 41:44.280
I know it's a hard thing to
say, but I speak from experience.

41:44.282 --> 41:46.349
Don't squander the time you have left

41:46.351 --> 41:48.784
by being overly focused on fixes.

41:48.786 --> 41:50.786
But I want her to get better.

41:50.788 --> 41:54.724
Then get on that phone. Buy
your ticket to Las Vegas.

41:54.726 --> 41:56.859
Being with you,

41:56.861 --> 41:59.762
seeing you, hearing your voice,

41:59.764 --> 42:02.865
that's the best medicine
you could give your mother.

42:02.867 --> 42:06.369
That you can give each other.

42:21.386 --> 42:22.485
[Line ringing]

42:22.487 --> 42:24.053
[Voicemail] You have reached the offices

42:24.055 --> 42:26.556
of Dr. Paul Stanfield
of the Anderson clinic.

42:26.558 --> 42:28.224
[Beep] Please leave a message.

42:28.226 --> 42:31.027
Dr. Stanfield, hi, my
name is Spencer Reid,

42:31.029 --> 42:33.896
and I was wondering if
you were available tomorrow

42:33.898 --> 42:36.732
to talk about my mother.

42:37.165 --> 42:40.266
Reid: "What greater thing
is there for human souls"

42:40.268 --> 42:43.036
"than to feel that they
are joined for life,

42:43.038 --> 42:45.874
to be with each other in
silent, unspeakable memories?"

42:45.974 --> 42:47.350
George Eliot.
