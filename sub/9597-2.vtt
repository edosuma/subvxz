10:36.035 --> 10:37.836
<i>just sign it,
and then everything is fine.</i>

10:37.870 --> 10:39.204
<i>- I...
- I just want an annulment.</i>

10:39.238 --> 10:40.371
Are you okay, Rizzoli?
Is everything all right?

10:40.406 --> 10:42.240
<i>...this piece of paper right now.</i>

10:42.274 --> 10:45.210
- Just do me that favor. Okay?
- Sure. Sure, I'll sign it.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.245
- Good.
- Over your dead body!

10:47.279 --> 10:50.181
All these years I had to
put up with your snoring!

10:50.215 --> 10:51.916
My snoring?!

10:51.950 --> 10:53.384
What about your creams and your...
and your flossing?

10:53.419 --> 10:54.652
In the bed, you flossed!

10:54.687 --> 10:56.020
- That's right!
- Right.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.723
In our marriage bed, 
where we made three children!

10:58.757 --> 11:00.257
- Ma, come on.
- Get away!

11:00.292 --> 11:01.259
That's right, and you
still treat them like kids.

11:01.293 --> 11:02.827
Okay, move on, Angela!

11:02.861 --> 11:03.694
Frank, come on.
This isn't the time or place.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.129
Let's take it outside.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.865
This is not your business.
I'm talking to my wife.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.033
- Your ex-wife.
- Thank god.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.901
I will not dishonor our children!
I won't do it!

11:13.706 --> 11:15.908
Angela!

11:20.246 --> 11:23.214
I idolized you. You know that?

11:23.249 --> 11:25.216
Janie...

11:25.250 --> 11:27.252
No, no. I don't want to hear it.
You need to go, Pop.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.991
Ma...

11:39.330 --> 11:40.899
Tommy?

11:40.933 --> 11:44.803
Hey. Maura.
How you doing?

11:44.837 --> 11:45.970
How'd you get down here?

11:46.005 --> 11:47.806
Oh, I got my ways.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.474
Tommy, this area is secure.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.142
Yeah. I'm on the job.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.811
Murphy's funeral home
needed more pick-up guys.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.813
Guess your people are
too busy with murders,

11:55.848 --> 11:58.116
so they hired me to pick
up the ones that just croak.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.785
Well, great. 
Congratulations.

11:59.819 --> 12:03.855
So, listen, I, um...
I kind of need some advice.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.391
From me? 
Sure. Shoot.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.193
Well, you know my Dad's back.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.729
I heard about what
happened at the café.

12:10.763 --> 12:11.897
Jane told you?

12:11.931 --> 12:15.400
Uh, no. No. 
Jane and I are...

12:15.434 --> 12:17.268
not so, um...

12:17.303 --> 12:19.337
close as ...
as we used to be.

12:19.371 --> 12:22.407
Well, you know my Dad's
getting remarried, right?

12:22.441 --> 12:25.743
Yeah, he told us today.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.012
No wonder Jane was so off.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.747
Well, I mean, it's kind of a good thing

12:29.782 --> 12:31.115
that you and Jane aren't talking.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.751
Oh, no, it's not. It's awful.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.422
Well, I just mean, you know,
now that you're not talking,

12:37.456 --> 12:41.226
- ... maybe we could ...
- Tommy. [ chuckles ]

12:41.261 --> 12:42.761
- What?
- A guy's got to dream, right? 

12:42.795 --> 12:46.131
[ laughs ]
Advice. You said you needed advice.

12:46.165 --> 12:50.770
Right. I'm gonna tell you
something, but you can't tell anyone.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.173
I'm a vault.

12:53.207 --> 12:56.110
I, uh...

12:58.080 --> 13:01.782
I kind of... know...

13:01.817 --> 13:03.050
my Dad's fiancé.

13:03.085 --> 13:04.418
"Know."

13:04.453 --> 13:05.887
As in the biblical sense?

13:05.921 --> 13:08.055
Yeah. That sense.

13:08.090 --> 13:10.291
I-I mean, I only "knew" her one time,

13:10.326 --> 13:13.461
but that's just still wrong, right?

13:14.931 --> 13:16.598
I mean, do you think
I should tell my Dad?

13:21.905 --> 13:23.239
[ beep ]

13:23.273 --> 13:27.010
Lower extremities are
well-muscularized, no evidence of trauma.

13:27.044 --> 13:29.012
Results are in on the white powder.

13:29.046 --> 13:31.382
What, from the victim's
apartment? Was it cocaine?

13:34.986 --> 13:36.087
Negative for cocaine.

13:36.121 --> 13:37.455
Well, what was it?

13:37.489 --> 13:39.557
Heroin? Crystal meth? 
Ketamine?

13:39.591 --> 13:41.158
Sodium. Bicarbonate.

13:41.192 --> 13:44.961
Tricky. Baking soda.

13:44.995 --> 13:47.096
Thank you, Susie.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.832
Uh, you're welcome.

13:49.866 --> 13:51.934
Nice work, senior criminalist Chang.

13:51.968 --> 13:54.836
Nice work, chief medical examiner Maura.

13:54.871 --> 13:58.240
Well, that explains why
Rachel had white powder

13:58.274 --> 14:00.843
- ...in her shower caddy.
- "Caddy"?

14:00.877 --> 14:02.377
[ beep ] Livor Mortis is indiscernible.

14:02.412 --> 14:05.248
Okay. I'm sorry. [ sighs ]

14:05.282 --> 14:08.518
Please explain to me why she
had baking soda in her caddy.

14:08.553 --> 14:10.620
You were just being nice
because you want information.

14:10.654 --> 14:12.255
She used it to wash her hair.

14:12.290 --> 14:15.993
It's less toxic to the
environment than shampoo.

14:16.028 --> 14:17.862
Well, that's commitment.

14:17.897 --> 14:20.631
She's really fit, yeah?

14:20.665 --> 14:22.633
She's had anterior dislocations

14:22.667 --> 14:25.269
to both her left and
right humerus bones.

14:25.303 --> 14:26.570
I'd love to know why that's relevant.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.271
It's too bad you don't guess.

14:28.306 --> 14:30.540
Well, you're in luck.
It's national guessing day.

14:30.574 --> 14:34.577
- Are you celebrating?
- I am.

14:34.611 --> 14:36.879
She has these injuries
because of repeated

14:36.913 --> 14:39.615
"Chaturanga dandasana to
urdhva mukkha svanasana".

14:39.649 --> 14:42.351
I know what that is ... yoga.

14:42.386 --> 14:44.487
Are you breaking out in
hives from the guessing?

14:44.521 --> 14:49.259
Not yet. And her rash is
the result of "defatting,"

14:49.294 --> 14:52.130
the chemical dissolution
of dermal lipids.

14:52.164 --> 14:57.135
- What's that in "yucky rash" lingo?
- She was submerged in icky stuff.

14:57.170 --> 14:59.037
Oh, submerged, great.

14:59.072 --> 15:02.407
So the vegan girl is bathing
in chemicals ... great.

15:02.441 --> 15:07.144
- Uh, Jane.
- What? I thought we were done.

15:07.179 --> 15:09.113
Okay.

15:12.684 --> 15:15.285
[ chuckles ]

15:16.954 --> 15:19.155
Rachel was not snorting coke.

15:19.190 --> 15:20.457
What was she doing with it?

15:20.491 --> 15:21.925
Washing her hair.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.527
That's expensive shampoo. You ...

15:23.561 --> 15:24.962
Jane.

15:24.996 --> 15:29.333
It was baking soda, all right, Frost?

15:29.367 --> 15:31.335
[ sighs ] So why was she in the tunnels,

15:31.369 --> 15:34.071
who was in there, and
why did they kill her?

15:34.106 --> 15:37.608
- Uh, Jane, you should, uh ...
- Did you check her financials?

15:37.642 --> 15:41.011
She owed BCU 
27 grand, which ...

15:41.046 --> 15:42.580
which is weird because...

15:42.614 --> 15:44.582
it was all covered with
student loans and grants.

15:44.616 --> 15:46.217
So what'd she do with all that money?

15:46.251 --> 15:48.086
I'll get a subpoena
for her bank records.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.288
Yeah, we got to figure out what this is.

15:50.323 --> 15:52.491
Oh! Nice T.P. tail.

15:54.194 --> 15:57.696
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

15:57.730 --> 15:59.330
Why didn't you tell me?

15:59.365 --> 16:01.232
- Tell you what?
- We didn't even notice.

16:01.266 --> 16:03.634
Yeah, right. They can see
it from across the street.

16:03.668 --> 16:06.503
God, can this day get any worse?!

16:06.537 --> 16:10.240
Sorry.
[ chuckles ]

16:14.351 --> 16:16.351
Frost:  I've found a symbol
on Rachel's tile.  

16:16.352 --> 16:20.689
- There it is. It's trademarked.
- "Sensei Matta yoga."

16:20.724 --> 16:23.259
Rachel's bank shows automatic
monthly payments to the same place.

16:23.293 --> 16:27.263
She spent $25,000 on yoga?
In five months?

16:27.298 --> 16:31.134
- Enlightenment is expensive.
- Owner's name is... Sensei Matta.

16:31.168 --> 16:33.670
Well, that's not the
name his mother gave him.

16:33.704 --> 16:35.739
Yoga studio is nearby. Come
on, let's go talk to him.

16:35.773 --> 16:37.174
He went to a lot of trouble
to hide his identity.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.376
Maybe we keep it on the down low
so we don't spook him?

16:39.410 --> 16:40.610
[ cellphone vibrates ]

16:40.645 --> 16:42.746
Stop!

16:42.780 --> 16:45.082
Frost, track his business records,
find out what his real name is.

16:45.116 --> 16:45.949
Come on, Korsak. Let's go do some yoga.

16:45.984 --> 16:47.584
[ groans ]

16:47.619 --> 16:49.686
- Crap.
- What?

16:49.721 --> 16:52.356
Floater just beached himself
on the north bank of the Charles.

16:52.390 --> 16:53.857
Man, you're lucky.

16:53.892 --> 16:56.861
It's probably a suicide.
You'll make Detective.

16:56.895 --> 16:58.862
Yeah, when I'm 104.

16:58.896 --> 17:00.263
Come with me.

17:00.298 --> 17:01.397
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

17:13.944 --> 17:16.314
Would you pay 25 grand
to look like that?

17:16.348 --> 17:18.316
Nah. I'd rather drink my 6-pack.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.986
Have a Boston whaler with a tuna tower.

17:21.020 --> 17:23.387
Welcome. Love and light.

Oh, I'm sorry, this is
a caffeine-free zone.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.194
Oh.

17:29.228 --> 17:31.797
Uh, I'm ... I'm sorry. We had no idea.

Oh, that goes in composting.

17:42.843 --> 17:44.944
accustomed to...
such a nice yoga studio.

17:44.978 --> 17:49.181
Yoga is an excellent way to keep
up with the demands of a young wife.

17:49.215 --> 17:51.750
And I'm very demanding.

17:51.784 --> 17:54.952
Whew, you sure are...

- Oh, no, no, no. No.

We're not dressed for yoga.

17:59.992 --> 18:02.960
Actually, we would like
to meet Sensei Matta.

Nobody meets the master
until after class.

Hey. Look at his forehead.

You think that's fish activity?

It could be blunt force trauma.

20:55.362 --> 20:57.463
Oh, Rachel Lawson,
the one that told us about this place.

20:57.498 --> 21:00.400
That's the one, yes.
She said she'd been to the retreat.

21:00.434 --> 21:02.402
Rachel ascended very quickly.

21:02.436 --> 21:04.871
Huh. Must be flexible.

21:04.905 --> 21:09.242
Sensei Matta believes Rachel is, uh...
spiritually gifted.

21:09.276 --> 21:12.212
Hmm.

21:12.246 --> 21:13.413
I'll get you packets to fill out.

21:13.447 --> 21:16.883
Now that you're ready to ascend,
you'll put a credit card on file.

21:16.917 --> 21:19.152
Rachel's parents said she
didn't have a boyfriend.

21:19.187 --> 21:21.021
Yeah. Bet they didn't know she
was "spiritually gifted," either.

21:21.055 --> 21:24.190
- I got a bad feeling.
- Me too.

- Anything?
- Yeah. A lot.

That's your Sensei Matta.

21:34.819 --> 21:37.854
Well, how are we gonna find his
retreat in all of western mass?

21:37.889 --> 21:40.857
- What are these shaded areas?
- I've been busy.

21:40.891 --> 21:43.992
Sensei Matta yoga bought 20,000
acres there, all within the last year.

21:44.027 --> 21:45.594
It's all protected land. How?

21:45.628 --> 21:48.230
Using their nonprofit
religious exemption.

21:48.264 --> 21:51.833
Ohh, now I really have a bad feeling.

21:51.867 --> 21:55.904
I've also been through all of BCU's
security footage of tunnel entrances.

21:55.972 --> 21:58.673
Rachel started going in five months ago.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.874
Right after her parents separated.

21:59.909 --> 22:03.011
Then she stopped for months.
Started going again two weeks ago.

22:03.045 --> 22:04.712
I want to know what
happened two weeks ago.

22:04.746 --> 22:05.879
Me too.

22:05.914 --> 22:07.614
Last time was three days ago,

22:07.649 --> 22:09.983
the day she was murdered.
No one followed her.

22:10.018 --> 22:12.119
There's a lot of tunnel
entrances in campus buildings.

22:12.153 --> 22:13.487
Somebody was in there.

22:13.521 --> 22:15.055
[ clears throat ]

22:15.089 --> 22:18.692
The victim's rash was caused
by benzene and 1,4-dioxane,

22:18.726 --> 22:20.261
likely from a fresh water source.

22:20.295 --> 22:23.163
I've narrowed it down to seven
lakes in western Massachusetts.

22:23.197 --> 22:24.865
Are you saying those lakes are polluted?

22:24.899 --> 22:28.101
I not. The PH levels
and mineral content are.

22:28.135 --> 22:31.571
Swell. My sprout troop used to have
sleepover camps at one of those lakes.

22:31.605 --> 22:35.609
- You were a sprout trooper?
- Yes. Why is that so hard to believe?

22:35.643 --> 22:38.878
You mean because it is your
"duty as a sprout trooper

22:38.913 --> 22:41.514
to be kind, friendly, generous"?

22:41.548 --> 22:43.883
I was so sweet and kind,
I won "sweetest camper."

22:43.918 --> 22:46.519
Two years in a row.
So, ha ha ha.

22:46.554 --> 22:47.754
Was anyone else there?

22:52.059 --> 22:55.762
To watch you...

22:55.797 --> 22:57.297
Nice recovery.

22:59.100 --> 23:02.069
The pollution must be recent
because it's not showing up

23:02.103 --> 23:04.271
in any of the water quality reports.

23:04.305 --> 23:07.074
Bet you that's where Rachel
was driving that campus car to.

23:07.109 --> 23:08.943
Well, it's a small
needle in a big haystack.

23:08.978 --> 23:11.612

my own water quality testing.

23:14.716 --> 23:18.586
Hey! Dr. Isles...
since you're going anyway,

23:18.620 --> 23:19.787
would you get a statement
from Matthew Moore?

23:19.821 --> 23:21.055
Goes by the name of Sensei Matta.

Oh! You can't have a medical examiner

23:30.998 --> 23:32.799
I'm sure she's taking a different road.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.834

- You're right. I am.

23:34.869 --> 23:37.103

It is more energy

Fine, but I'm driving.

24:48.881 --> 24:50.248
Why do you get to drive?

31:45.487 --> 31:46.955
Okay, bottom line it for me.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.190
The blood supply to my lower
leg has been compromised.

31:49.225 --> 31:51.860
- I'll lose my leg unless ...
- Unless we get you to a hospital.

31:51.894 --> 31:53.528
- Maura, come on!
- No, unless you do a fasciotomy.

31:54.964 --> 31:58.067
- I need something sharp.
- What? No, Maura, I ...

31:58.101 --> 32:00.870
Maura, I'm not gonna cut
your leg off with a nail file.

32:00.904 --> 32:03.139
- Do you have sugar packets?
- No, why? Did you bring coffee?

32:03.174 --> 32:04.507
I could use it to dress the wound.

32:04.542 --> 32:05.608
Do you still have your phone?

32:05.643 --> 32:07.877
Yes. Yes.

32:07.912 --> 32:09.879
Why didn't I think of that?

32:09.913 --> 32:11.481
That's luck. We can call 911.

32:11.515 --> 32:12.982
Oh, it's busted!

32:13.016 --> 32:16.018
The touch screen is gorilla glass.

32:18.788 --> 32:22.023
No, Maura.
I'm ... I'm not gonna do this.

32:22.057 --> 32:23.625
It'll work. Okay.

32:23.659 --> 32:25.093
You're gonna make a
6-inch incision right here.

32:25.127 --> 32:27.028
And a 5-inch there.

32:27.062 --> 32:29.631
Okay, just try not to cut the
superficial peroneal nerve.

32:29.665 --> 32:31.166
- No. I can't do this.
- Take off your shirt.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.035
What? Okay, now I know
you've suffered a head injury.

32:34.069 --> 32:36.838
- And let's go.
- To bind the wound. Okay, come on.

32:36.872 --> 32:40.742
Oh, god, Maura. Please ...
please don't make me do this.

32:40.776 --> 32:42.177
Listen to me. Listen to me.

32:42.211 --> 32:45.647
You just keep on cutting, okay,
till the blood starts to flow.

32:45.681 --> 32:48.283
Maura, I'm sorry. I can't do this.

32:48.317 --> 32:50.619
You're a sprout trooper! Okay?

32:50.653 --> 32:52.154
Just ... once you make
the double incision,

32:52.188 --> 32:54.256
you massage the wound like this.

32:54.290 --> 32:56.058
Okay, the blood will be black.

32:56.092 --> 32:58.727
I can't. I can't. I'm so
sorry. I can't do this.

32:58.761 --> 33:00.662
- I'm sorry.
- I really like my leg, Jane.

33:00.696 --> 33:03.031
Oh, please. [ groans ]

33:03.066 --> 33:05.600
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, god.

33:05.634 --> 33:08.603
Okay. Okay.

33:08.637 --> 33:10.004
Okay. [ exhales sharply ]

33:10.039 --> 33:12.607
All right. All right. You ready?

33:15.845 --> 33:17.312
Okay.

33:17.347 --> 33:19.248
- Use more pressure. I'm okay.
- You're all right?

33:21.786 --> 33:23.954
Ow!

33:23.988 --> 33:25.922
<i>I'm not okay! Aah!</i>

33:25.956 --> 33:27.824
Ohh!

33:28.692 --> 33:32.062
Maura?
Maura?

33:32.096 --> 33:36.065
Korsak: Rachel was a Phd
candidate in geology at BCU,

33:36.100 --> 33:38.968
McNamara is a professor of
hydrology at Waltham University.

33:39.002 --> 33:40.702
Too close to be a coincidence.

33:40.736 --> 33:42.704
She didn't take any classes with him.

33:42.738 --> 33:45.240
- Nope.
- Any e-mail correspondence?

33:45.274 --> 33:47.843
No. No phone calls,
text messages, nothing.

33:47.877 --> 33:50.245
Maybe she watched his
"Fate of the Earth" talk.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.882
Searching Rachel's browser history.

33:52.916 --> 33:54.116
[ keys clacking ]

33:54.151 --> 33:56.119
Hold on.

33:56.153 --> 33:58.721
There it is ...
his "Fate of the Earth" talk.

33:58.756 --> 34:02.659
So, she knew his work on fracking.

34:02.694 --> 34:04.661
They were talking to each other.

34:04.696 --> 34:06.964
I found a thread in the comments section

34:06.998 --> 34:08.098
between McNamara and "rockRachel."

34:08.132 --> 34:09.599
What's it say?

34:09.632 --> 34:11.101
"I have evidence of fracking.

34:11.135 --> 34:13.969
"Can you meet today in
tunnels under GEO building?"

34:14.005 --> 34:15.038
That's two weeks ago.

34:15.072 --> 34:19.109
Looks like they met again...
the day Rachel was killed.

34:19.143 --> 34:22.145
"Meet me. Same place.
3:00. Bad news."

34:22.179 --> 34:24.880
Where the hell is Jane?

34:30.786 --> 34:34.290
Come on, Maura, it's time to wake up.

34:34.324 --> 34:37.994
[ drowsily ] I dreamt we were camping.

34:38.027 --> 34:39.862
I voted for you.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.998
Can you turn the heat down?

34:44.033 --> 34:46.868
Come on, we got to get you out of here.

34:46.902 --> 34:48.036
[ sighs ]

34:48.071 --> 34:49.771
You won sweetest camper again.

34:49.804 --> 34:53.107
I didn't win.

34:55.143 --> 34:58.178
My leg hurts. Why ...
why does my leg hurt?

34:58.213 --> 35:00.146
[ twigs snapping ]

35:00.181 --> 35:01.381
[ gun cocks ]

35:09.958 --> 35:13.861
- Sensei Matta, I presume?
- And you are officer...

35:13.895 --> 35:17.866
- Detective Rizzoli.
- Detective?

35:17.900 --> 35:20.585
Kind of stupid to drive a
car registered to the Boston

35:20.586 --> 35:23.271
police out to my retreat.
Don't you think, Detective?

35:26.709 --> 35:29.744
- Get up. Both of you.
- My friend's hurt. She can't move.

35:29.779 --> 35:30.979
Get her off the ground.

35:34.182 --> 35:36.783
Let's go.

35:36.818 --> 35:39.152
[ gasps ]
It's all right. It's all right.

35:42.981 --> 35:45.181
What if their car crashed?  

35:45.182 --> 35:46.783
[ cellphone vibrates ] Try not to worry, Ma.
I'm sure they're okay.

35:46.817 --> 35:48.685
The state police would have
called BPD, Mrs. Rizzoli.

35:48.719 --> 35:51.053
All right, thanks.

35:52.623 --> 35:55.490
That was my contact in
army personnel records.

35:55.525 --> 35:57.025
Matthew Moore is an ex-army ranger.

35:57.060 --> 36:00.162
- He was a Blackwater operative, too.
- Sounds like one bad-ass Yogi.

36:00.196 --> 36:01.129
I don't like it. I'm
gonna take a ride up there.

36:01.164 --> 36:04.599
Take a ride? They could be at
any one of those seven lakes.

36:04.634 --> 36:07.603
I've got to do something.
Jane and Dr. Isles are out there.

36:07.637 --> 36:13.109
How'd you make the transition from
yoga to fracking ... hard left at fraud?

36:13.144 --> 36:15.579
This land is full of black
gold ... all from shale rock.

36:15.613 --> 36:18.015
I just needed capital
to tap its potential.

36:18.049 --> 36:20.017
And a religion hide behind?

36:20.052 --> 36:22.587
So you swindled vulnerable
college students?

36:22.654 --> 36:24.755
I was already a martial arts master.

36:24.790 --> 36:27.758
Didn't take much to repackage
what I knew and sell it.

36:27.793 --> 36:30.161
You figured out that Rachel
was a brilliant geologist,

36:30.195 --> 36:32.830
and you brought her here to
analyze your rocks for free?

36:32.864 --> 36:37.234
Actually, she paid me for the privilege.
She was very obedient.

36:37.268 --> 36:39.969
And she...
helped until she realized

36:40.003 --> 36:42.972
that you were destroying
this wilderness.

36:43.006 --> 36:44.907
She stole shale samples from me,

36:44.941 --> 36:47.643
gave them to an environmental
conspiracy crackpot.

36:47.678 --> 36:51.948
I guess you could say we
were at cross-purposes.

36:53.317 --> 36:56.052
[ straining ]

36:56.087 --> 36:57.821
I'm a homicide Detective.

36:57.855 --> 36:59.990
Every cop from here to
Boston will be looking for us.

37:00.024 --> 37:02.259
Too bad you can't look behind you.

37:02.293 --> 37:04.527
You'd have a nice view of the
water when it comes through.

37:04.562 --> 37:07.197
See, you're in a spillway
for one of my reservoirs.

37:07.231 --> 37:09.532
A few million gallons of water's
gonna come pouring through here.

37:09.567 --> 37:12.936
It's pretty toxic from all the fracking.

37:12.971 --> 37:14.238
If I were you, I wouldn't drink it.

37:15.774 --> 37:18.709

Come on!
