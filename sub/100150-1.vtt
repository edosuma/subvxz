WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.258
ABENDSEN:
Each one of these films

00:07.299 --> 00:11.262
show a reality like ours
but not.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.472
Some of us are rotten

00:13.514 --> 00:15.474
or kind in one reality,

00:15.516 --> 00:19.103
rotten or kind in the next.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.896
-But most people are different.
-SOLDIERS: Heil!

00:20.938 --> 00:23.023
-Heil!
-ROCKWELL:
When the hour of decision

00:23.065 --> 00:25.025
came for Thomas Smith,

00:25.067 --> 00:27.528
he rose to the occasion
in a way

00:27.570 --> 00:28.779
that admirably reflected

00:28.821 --> 00:30.614
upon his father.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.450
HELEN:
The Reichsfuhrer
believes in spirits,

00:32.491 --> 00:34.076
spectral phenomena.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.578
We could talk to him.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.538
In the beyond?

00:37.580 --> 00:38.998
What have you taken?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.082
I got rid of my pills,

00:40.124 --> 00:41.167
if that's what you mean.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.334
SMITH:
I know you're a strong woman.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.836
It's my job to protect you.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.588
HELEN:
And the school called today.

00:45.588 --> 00:48.132
They want to schedule
Jennifer's test.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.258
And if she tests positive?

00:49.300 --> 00:50.384
Stop!

00:50.426 --> 00:52.094
SMITH:
Can you just come home?

00:53.137 --> 00:55.306
I love you, John.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.350
But I was running away
from you.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.394
I wish to extend

01:00.436 --> 01:02.062
my deepest condolences

01:02.104 --> 01:04.607
for the loss of your only son.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.358
I, too,
have experienced the same.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.402
You presented a film in Berlin.

01:08.444 --> 01:10.029
I provided that film

01:10.070 --> 01:11.781
for Chief Inspector Kido.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.032
You averted war.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.700
We deceived them.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.243
How long
before the Nazis realize

01:16.285 --> 01:17.912
they should have attacked us

01:17.953 --> 01:19.288
when they had the chance?

01:19.330 --> 01:20.956
My father allowed his generals
to use his throne

01:20.998 --> 01:22.333
as a shield for their ambition.

01:22.374 --> 01:26.837
We merely preside over
its undoing.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.464
CROWN PRINCESS:
My husband,

01:28.506 --> 01:30.841
he fears our grip on the empire

01:30.883 --> 01:31.842
is loosening.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.135
One thing is certain.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.055
The Nazis covet
the Pacific States.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.223
If they perceive weakness,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.266
they will strike.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.434
Wyatt Price?

01:40.476 --> 01:42.478
WYATT:
I brought you this far.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.105
I think it's time you tell me
what the hell's going on.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.233
Ever heard
of the Man in the High Castle?

01:47.274 --> 01:49.026
Why are you helping me?

01:49.068 --> 01:51.028
WYATT:
They killed half my family
in Ireland.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.613
The other half in New York.

01:52.655 --> 01:53.697
And I don't know

01:53.739 --> 01:54.865
if that film is real or not,

01:54.907 --> 01:56.992
but it got me thinking.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.953
JULIANA:
It's proof
there are other possibilities.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.163
And this world will not last

02:01.205 --> 02:02.998
if we don't change it
for the better.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.334
It's only a matter of time.
It will get worse.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.711
Help me change it.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.717
KIDO:
I have seen those painted
all over San Francisco

02:13.759 --> 02:15.970
and the Neutral Zone.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.972
I never imagined
they were yours.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.890
Where did you see him last?

02:19.932 --> 02:21.225
Denver.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.476
(grunts)

02:22.518 --> 02:24.395
Where is he?

02:24.436 --> 02:25.896
You remember me,

02:25.938 --> 02:27.189
Mr. Frink?

02:28.357 --> 02:29.400
Out of weakness,

02:29.441 --> 02:31.360
I let you go.

02:31.402 --> 02:34.572
That was my mistake.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.074
What does it mean,
Die Nebenwelt?

02:37.116 --> 02:38.826
It means "the next world."

02:38.868 --> 02:40.369
A parallel world.
And when we reach it

02:40.411 --> 02:42.162
-and the world after that...
-Heil!

02:42.204 --> 02:44.081
-Heil! Heil!
-...and the world after that,

02:44.164 --> 02:46.750
the Reich will be everywhere.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.132
HIMMLER:
We will do away with the old.

02:53.173 --> 02:58.012
Today, history ends.

02:59.013 --> 03:04.310
And the future begins!

03:06.562 --> 03:08.689
We must accelerate
the number of tests

03:08.731 --> 03:11.400
-and expand their scale.
-Right.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.236
To begin
to march troops through!

03:14.278 --> 03:15.738
(Himmler laughs)

03:16.780 --> 03:19.199
There's someone up there. Go!

03:20.200 --> 03:21.160
JEREMY:
Grenade! Go!

03:21.201 --> 03:22.369
-Go! Move!
-Juliana!

03:22.411 --> 03:24.204
-No!
-No!

03:25.915 --> 03:27.166
Hello, Juliana.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.835
You've been busy
since I last saw you.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.879
You know,
the night Thomas came to see me,

03:31.921 --> 03:34.089
it was heartbreaking
how ashamed he was.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.133
Telling him
how much you loved him

03:36.175 --> 03:37.843
just wasn't enough

03:37.885 --> 03:41.138
to save him
from the way he was raised.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.182
SMITH:
Four people were sent
into a portal.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.059
Only one went through.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.019
ABENDSEN:
Whatever plans you people have,

03:47.061 --> 03:48.479
they won't work.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.772
If she was able to enter

03:49.813 --> 03:51.899
a parallel world, it's because

03:51.941 --> 03:54.234
she didn't exist in it.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.812
Peace and harmony.

07:58.854 --> 08:04.318
That is what Mr. Tagomi sought.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.864
We lost him to an act
of violence...

08:08.906 --> 08:11.617
at the very moment...

08:11.658 --> 08:15.037
we needed him most.

08:17.789 --> 08:22.586
His spirit is Japan's spirit.

08:22.628 --> 08:27.716
True Japanese spirit.

08:27.758 --> 08:32.471
In our drive
for empire building...

08:32.512 --> 08:37.476
we have lost sight
of this spirit.

08:37.517 --> 08:42.814
Violence produces more violence.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.068
This is what is happening
in San Francisco.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.529
Outrageous.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.407
I intend...

08:52.449 --> 08:55.786
to see Tagomi's work...

08:55.827 --> 08:59.706
completed.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.506
(bell rings)

09:13.178 --> 09:14.680
What nerve.

09:14.721 --> 09:18.517
It's not her place to interfere
in political matters!

09:18.558 --> 09:21.019
And it's not your place to
question the Royal Family.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.901
She's meddling, Admiral.
It's undignified.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.283
Chief Inspector.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.830
I want you to find
Tagomi's killer.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.915
I will do everything
in my power.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.500
And when you do,

09:43.542 --> 09:46.169
I want you to bring
the final report

09:46.211 --> 09:48.714
to me directly.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.216
Your Highness.

09:59.975 --> 10:03.353
You will do nothing of the kind.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.153
Sir.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.571
Colonel.

10:12.612 --> 10:18.243
The Reich has made an incursion
into the Neutral Zone.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.080
Where in the Neutral Zone?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.123
Denver.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.759
Fall back!

10:33.800 --> 10:35.802
Move!

10:38.805 --> 10:40.432
(man shouting indistinctly)

10:40.474 --> 10:41.641
Sitrep?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.402
We just lost our air cover!

10:54.863 --> 10:57.407
Fuck!

10:57.449 --> 11:00.327
Pablo, on me!

11:00.369 --> 11:01.787
Sitrep?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.414
Bravo's in heavy contact
on East Colfax.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.584
Charlie said a panzer's on 17th.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.773
Is that train moving yet?

11:29.815 --> 11:32.734
The munitions
and films are almost loaded!

11:32.776 --> 11:35.737
Just ten more minutes,
they'll be in the mountains!

LEM:
Wyatt!

12:38.508 --> 12:40.719
Wyatt!

12:40.760 --> 12:42.429
We got to go now! Come on!

12:42.471 --> 12:45.474
-The films. The guns.
-It's gone.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.079
Don't tell me it doesn't
give you a hard-on, John.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.041
Haven't had this much fun

13:11.082 --> 13:14.002
since we were mixing it up
with the Japs in Samoa.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.046
Got a present for you.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.102
Care to do the honors?

13:40.070 --> 13:41.821
(lighter clicks)

14:00.173 --> 14:03.176
You should be
enjoying this more.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.142
It's just celluloid, Bill.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.353
And Wyatt Price.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.397
You'll have his head on a plate
soon enough.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.274
His entire supply line
just went up in smoke.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.150
(laughs)
Maybe.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.652
Japs'll raise a stink

14:20.694 --> 14:22.571
about how we violated
the treaty, of course.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.656
Ah, let 'em.
Nothing they can do.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.242
They've got their hands full
with the war in China,

14:27.284 --> 14:30.662
now these... black rebels.

14:30.704 --> 14:34.666
The trade minister, Tagomi,
assassinated a few days ago.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.377
I'm sure they'll try to say
we did that, too.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.589
Did we?

14:41.590 --> 14:43.341
(gunshot in distance)

14:48.096 --> 14:50.140
Why not just keep going?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.019
Push right on through
to the Pacific?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.437
That's your hard-on talking,
Bill.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.147
I'm serious.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.858
We could reunify this country,
John, under one flag.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.901
Just bide your time.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.154
The Japanese Empire
is crumbling.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.615
Take it from me.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.825
Our day will come.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.994
Sure enough.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.496
-We heading back to the Reich?
-You are.

15:13.538 --> 15:17.542
I've got something I need
to take care of in Montana.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.878
Family business?

15:23.798 --> 15:25.967
Glad to hear it, John.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.551
Mom and I just put up
a wire fence.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.928
HANK:
Good for you, Amy.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.431
We are gonna make a farmer
out of you yet.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.141
Let's go pull up some potatoes.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.726
WOMAN (over radio):
This is Resistance Radio,

16:16.768 --> 16:18.645
broadcasting to you from...

16:18.687 --> 16:20.939
We're sure as hell
not telling you where.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.274
We're still waiting
for reports from Denver.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.153
Nazi forces have broken the
treaty and invaded the city.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.948
Stay tuned, and Miss Evangeline
will keep you updated.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.950
("This Land is Your Land"
by Woody Guthrie plays)

16:31.991 --> 16:34.327
Now this one goes out
to our men and women

16:34.369 --> 16:35.954
fighting for the cause.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.789
-Mom?

YAMORI:
What is your concern, Colonel?

16:57.559 --> 16:59.394
KIDO:
My fear is this incursion

16:59.436 --> 17:01.896
into Denver is just
an opening move by the Reich.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.982
You think John Smith is trying
to take advantage

17:04.023 --> 17:05.734
of Tagomi's assassination?

17:05.775 --> 17:08.319
I think he might have arranged
Tagomi's assassination.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.947
Himmler tried to kill
the trade minister twice.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.491
You are overthinking this,
Colonel.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.578
The Nazis are clearing out
a rat's nest of rebels.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.621
We should take note.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.874
These Negro radicals
have mounted, what,

17:20.915 --> 17:23.042
17 attacks
in the last three months?

17:23.084 --> 17:24.544
(speaking Japanese)

17:24.586 --> 17:26.463
18 now, including Tagomi.

17:26.504 --> 17:30.759
General Masuda is flying in
from Tokyo for some art sale.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.469
I want you to meet with him

17:32.510 --> 17:35.597
to plan a crackdown
on these Black Communist rebels.

17:35.638 --> 17:39.392
Meantime, the crown princess
would like us to coddle them.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.026
General Yamori.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.194
Greetings.

17:56.868 --> 18:00.288
Welcome to my office.

18:00.330 --> 18:04.125
But I am afraid it is dangerous
here in San Francisco.

18:04.167 --> 18:08.213
These terrorists are still
at large.

18:08.254 --> 18:12.717
The BCR have stepped up attacks.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.803
Earlier, Your Highness...

18:14.844 --> 18:17.305
might well have been
their victim.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.015
Were it not for Colonel Kido.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.935
YAMORI:
Even Kido can only do so much.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.104
Now, with this Nazi provocation
in the Neutral Zone,

18:25.146 --> 18:27.106
I must implore Your Highness

18:27.148 --> 18:30.235
to return to the safety
of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.570
Perhaps if I were
the crown prince,

18:32.612 --> 18:36.616
you would be as interested in my
views as you are in my safety.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.661
I meant what I said.

18:39.702 --> 18:43.456
I will remain
until my work here is complete.

18:57.428 --> 19:00.348
Someone has been whispering
in her ear.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.016
Is it you?

19:02.058 --> 19:04.018
Don't be absurd.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.522
Her Highness speaks for herself

19:07.564 --> 19:10.108
and with the consent
of the palace.

19:10.149 --> 19:14.362
You Navy appeasers are more
dangerous than the BCR.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.322
Appeasers?

19:16.364 --> 19:20.118
You don't know the battles
I've fought for Japan.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.495
When you speak,
I hear surrender.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.540
The Chinese are advancing
in Korea and Manchuria.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.960
Our resources are spread thin.

19:29.002 --> 19:33.131
How long do you think
we can hold this territory?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.717
As long as I'm alive.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.262
Hmm.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.306
Colonel, show the admiral out.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.610
(indistinct chatter)

20:07.123 --> 20:08.166
Hey, you.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.836
You, too.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.963
Hey, you!

20:14.005 --> 20:15.590
Empty the bag.

20:15.632 --> 20:16.966
ELIJAH:
There ain't nothing
in that bag, man.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.718
Oh! (groans)

20:18.760 --> 20:21.179
-Empty the bag!
-Okay, okay, okay, okay!

20:21.220 --> 20:24.307
-MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You, too.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.022
Who are you
and what is your purpose?

20:31.064 --> 20:34.317
My name is Bell Mallory.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.527
I'm a nanny
for the Takahashi family.

20:37.987 --> 20:38.988
Pick it up.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.240
Pick it up.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.288
(baby crying)

20:49.958 --> 20:52.335
(cries, coos)

20:52.377 --> 20:55.546
Hmm. Cute baby.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.508
Next.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.093
Get up. Get your belongings.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.015
(soldier continues indistinctly)

21:09.477 --> 21:12.522
(whispering indistinctly)

21:30.540 --> 21:32.667
Got it, B.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.086
All right, brother.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.883
Okay, all right.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.927
(baby crying)

21:43.970 --> 21:45.972
Let's get you home
to your mother.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.932
(crying continues)

21:47.974 --> 21:50.643
(shushing)

21:53.271 --> 21:55.690
-MAN: Got that in there.
-MAN 2: Yeah, I got it.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.191
-(grunts)
-You got it?

21:57.233 --> 21:59.610
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yo, keep them boys ready.

21:59.652 --> 22:03.781
-Exit on the first floor.
-Yeah. That's right.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.950
-There we go.
-Hey, girl.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.744
MAN:
Boy, give me that other one now.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.704
-WOMAN: Watch yourself.
-MAN: I got it.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.539
WOMAN:
We don't have room
for them here.

22:11.581 --> 22:14.083
MAN:
Then I'll make it fit.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.294
(laughs)

22:16.335 --> 22:19.589
Hush! You know
these walls are paper.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.632
You catch the look
that checkpoint sentry gave me?

22:21.674 --> 22:24.886
I saw the look you gave him.
You all but asked for a beating.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.471
Well, better me than you.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.264
Draw fire away from the nanny.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.600
That's what I was tasked to do.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.477
What? You got a problem with it?

22:32.518 --> 22:35.605
Yeah. I like that face of yours

22:35.646 --> 22:37.940
in one piece.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.276
Wouldn't hurt you to bow
a little deeper next time.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.070
(Elijah scoffs)

22:42.111 --> 22:43.988
(men shouting in distance)

22:47.158 --> 22:48.951
You see all the heat
in the avenue?

22:48.993 --> 22:51.996
It's about that government
official got shot.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.998
They think we did that.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.000
Doesn't change a thing.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.877
Don't break my concentration.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.921
(quietly):
Go.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.428
You know what "sangfroid" is?

23:07.470 --> 23:09.430
Mm-hmm. Cold blood.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.475
It's French.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.352
(laughs)
Well, you got it, baby.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.938
Sangfroid.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.482
-(laughs)
-Elijah,

23:19.524 --> 23:22.235
if I lose as much
as a firing pin,

23:22.276 --> 23:24.570
you ain't never
gettin' none again.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.656
-Oh, why would you say
such a thing?
-(loud knocking)

23:26.697 --> 23:29.909
-(man shouting in Japanese)
-(people yelling)

23:29.951 --> 23:32.745
-MAN: Let's go!
-(woman screaming)

23:32.787 --> 23:34.997
-(shouting in Japanese)
-(banging on doors)

23:38.501 --> 23:40.920
MAN:
All males line up
in the hallway.

23:40.962 --> 23:43.339
(distant shouting continues)

23:43.381 --> 23:45.842
Right now.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.223
(stammering)
No, no, no, no, no, no, wait!

23:55.309 --> 23:57.311
(banging on door)

24:19.625 --> 24:21.085
(woman shushing)

24:21.127 --> 24:24.505
Persons with knowledge
of the assassination

24:24.547 --> 24:29.093
of Trade Minister Tagomi
will step forward.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.733
Oy.

24:43.774 --> 24:44.775
Turn around.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.701
(man panting)

24:59.665 --> 25:01.209
Turn around.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.007
You.

25:13.638 --> 25:14.639
Turn around.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.141
-(groaning)
-Turn around!

25:17.183 --> 25:18.726
WOMAN:
Oh!

25:18.768 --> 25:20.853
-And you.
-No, no, no.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.522
No, no, no, no, no.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.366
Turn around.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.130
Oy.

25:49.674 --> 25:52.093
(grunts)

25:58.307 --> 26:00.309
You.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.983
(sniffs)

26:11.737 --> 26:13.781
Information

26:13.823 --> 26:16.075
on Tagomi's murderer...

26:18.577 --> 26:22.790
...or these men will not return.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.588
Oy!

26:29.630 --> 26:32.133
Let's go.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.968
(indistinct chatter)

26:34.010 --> 26:35.553
MAN:
Downstairs.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.180
MAN 2:
Get back inside. Go inside.

26:38.222 --> 26:41.142
(indistinct chatter continues)

26:41.183 --> 26:42.393
(door locks)

26:45.062 --> 26:46.564
(panting)

26:46.605 --> 26:48.399
There's way too much heat
right now.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.109
We got to call
Leadership Council,

26:50.151 --> 26:51.527
tell 'em we're postponing.

26:51.569 --> 26:53.696
No!

26:53.738 --> 26:55.698
Listen to me.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.366
Nothing has changed.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.035
We stick to the plan.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.329
Not my plan, not your plan.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.289
Equiano's plan.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.458
We are going to fight back.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.501
(Elijah panting)

27:18.637 --> 27:21.932
(triumphant music plays
over radio)

27:21.974 --> 27:23.976
MAN (over radio):
...all of today's news.

27:24.018 --> 27:25.978
A jubilant crowd
greeted Reich forces

27:26.020 --> 27:27.521
as they liberated
Denver today...

27:27.563 --> 27:29.940
-Is this everyone?
-No word from Charlie and Bravo.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.401
So far, this is it.

27:32.443 --> 27:35.738
This afternoon's blitzkrieg put
an end to this abomination.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.199
-(coughing)
-The Grand Palace Hotel,

27:38.240 --> 27:40.493
a known hotbed
of rebel activity,

27:40.534 --> 27:43.329
was demolished on the orders
of Reichsmarschall Smith.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.623
Wyatt Price, the treacherous
leader of the subversives,

27:45.664 --> 27:47.416
has gone to ground.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.668
The rebellion
has been destroyed...

27:49.710 --> 27:53.172
It's all history now.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.466
...in a landmark event
for the American people.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.760
Why are you following me?

27:57.802 --> 28:01.472
You told me to stick to you
like glue, sir.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.682
No, Pablo, you should go.

28:05.518 --> 28:09.438
Head back down to Mexico, be
with your compadres in Aztlan.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.023
Sir?

28:11.065 --> 28:12.650
Vaya con Dios.
(sniffs)

28:12.691 --> 28:15.319
You should go, too, Lem.
BCR needs you.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.530
You need them, not me.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.240
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

28:21.617 --> 28:24.328
I got a lot of people
killed today.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.832
Guys who watched the film
I showed them.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.042
Guys I gave hope to.

28:30.084 --> 28:33.254
Man, don't fucking
"vaya con Dios" me.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.839
Goddamn it, Lem.
It's all gone.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.215
-All the fucking films...
-Richie's got a print

28:36.257 --> 28:37.967
in New York.
He can make copies again.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.052
-He can't make more munitions.
-There's a lot of goddamn

28:40.094 --> 28:43.222
-guns out there.
-We can't bring the dead
back to life.

28:45.099 --> 28:46.892
Total fucking failure!

28:46.934 --> 28:49.478
A lot of men died today,
goddamn it, yes.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.689
Good men. Women, too.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.609
But if we just fuck off to our
own little factions right now,

28:55.651 --> 28:57.528
our struggle falls apart

28:57.570 --> 28:58.904
and they died for nothing.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.740
Maybe you deaf, man,

29:01.782 --> 29:04.535
from the explosions.
I don't know.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.538
But, Wyatt,
if you can hear my words,

29:07.580 --> 29:11.292
you fucking tell me.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.752
(crows cawing in distance)

29:19.550 --> 29:21.927
(gunfire in distance)

29:23.762 --> 29:26.515
Did you say
there's more guns out there?

29:30.144 --> 29:32.521
BCR's got a lot of guns.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.940
If there's even
the slightest chance

29:34.982 --> 29:37.067
you can broker a meeting
between them and me...

29:38.444 --> 29:41.822
Man,

29:41.864 --> 29:44.450
that's gonna be tough.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.452
-BCR, they don't fuck around.
-Yeah, I know.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.537
They don't want
to do business with Micks,

29:48.579 --> 29:50.581
ofays, white devils...

29:50.623 --> 29:52.166
It's beyond that.

29:52.208 --> 29:55.044
Their fight is
with the Japanese.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.089
Come on.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.426
I know you can get me in.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.846
Just long enough
for me to make my pitch.

30:09.225 --> 30:10.935
(sighs)

30:10.976 --> 30:12.770
(scoffs)

30:12.811 --> 30:14.939
I can try.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.359
I can't promise you shit.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.777
(sniffs)

30:19.818 --> 30:22.279
(gunfire continues in distance)

30:22.321 --> 30:26.033
Well, after today,

30:26.075 --> 30:28.702

31:13.497 --> 31:16.792
Hey. Thanks, Mary.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.794
I'm taking the crossword.

31:18.836 --> 31:19.878

31:33.642 --> 31:34.893

31:34.935 --> 31:37.646
That's right.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.982
Valentina Tereshkova.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.069
-Hey, would you do it?
-Hmm?

31:44.111 --> 31:47.072
Risk your life to...

31:47.114 --> 31:48.741
go up into space?

31:48.782 --> 31:49.992
Would you?

31:50.034 --> 31:51.577
Well, I've ridden horses

31:51.619 --> 31:54.079
near as dangerous
for not much more than a trophy.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.584
But, uh, I don't know,

31:58.626 --> 32:01.128
not so sure
we'll ever make it to the moon.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.880

32:02.921 --> 32:04.882

32:17.728 --> 32:21.148
Eh, I got a class to teach.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.566
Yeah.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.318
Another time then.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.112
I got an Andalusian to deliver,
besides.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.114

All right, everyone,
gather round.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.221
Let's settle into our horseshoe.

32:56.934 --> 32:58.894
Okay.

32:58.936 --> 33:01.063
Very nice.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.065
All right.

33:03.107 --> 33:05.859
Straight backs.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.404
And close our eyes.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.783
Hands on knees.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.785
Let's focus on our breathing.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.453
(inhales deeply)

33:16.495 --> 33:18.038
In through the nose,

33:18.080 --> 33:20.791
into the chest,

33:20.833 --> 33:22.209
out through the mouth.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.670
(exhaling)

33:27.881 --> 33:30.175
You won't find enlightenment
up your nose, Bobby.

33:30.217 --> 33:33.679
(soft chuckling)

33:33.721 --> 33:37.933
Now let's search
within ourselves.

33:37.975 --> 33:41.270
Try and find a fixed point
we can hold on to

33:41.311 --> 33:43.939
in a universe of chaos.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.521
(whispers):
Tagomi-san?

ALT-THOMAS (muffled):
Juliana.

34:52.633 --> 34:54.092
ALT-HELEN:
Juliana.

34:54.134 --> 34:57.596
Can you hear me?

34:57.638 --> 35:00.641
-ALT-THOMAS: Juliana?
-Juliana, can you hear me?
-Mm.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.602
-Juliana, can you hear me?
-Mm. Yeah.

35:03.644 --> 35:05.521
Yeah.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.397
(exhales)

35:07.439 --> 35:10.025
-What...
-You were... gone

35:10.067 --> 35:11.777
for ages, honey.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.570
-Oh, um...
-We were worried.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.656
We didn't know
if we should call a doctor...

35:15.697 --> 35:16.907
Doctor.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.535
(chuckling)

35:19.576 --> 35:21.203
I've been
in these states before.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.205
I know how to navigate them.

35:23.247 --> 35:25.207
"Navigate"?

35:25.249 --> 35:27.876
Are you sure this meditation
business is good for you?

35:27.918 --> 35:29.378
Yeah.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.213
It doesn't look that way
from here.

35:31.255 --> 35:33.131
No, really, I'm completely fine.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.969
I-I've spent a long time trying
to... get to a place like this.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.555
I know how strange
I must seem sometimes.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.349
(chuckles)
We're just concerned for you.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.351
All anyone wants
is to understand.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.353
I appreciate that.
And everything you've done

35:46.395 --> 35:48.355
in the past months, really.

35:48.397 --> 35:49.773
But there's no need to worry.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.526
I promise.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.111
-Come on.
-I promise.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.197
Mom, I think
we should let Juliana be alone.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.449
We'll just keep praying
for you then.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.326
-Okay, thank you.
Thank you both.
-(chuckles)

36:01.368 --> 36:02.578
I'll see you later.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.214
-(door opens)
-IIJIMA: Sir,

36:14.256 --> 36:16.174
we have a suspect.

36:16.884 --> 36:19.094
Kempeitai!

36:19.136 --> 36:20.637
(shouting in Japanese)

36:26.643 --> 36:29.104
(toilet flushing)

36:29.146 --> 36:32.107
Come out with your hands
behind your head.

36:32.149 --> 36:33.108
I'm coming out.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.819
IIJIMA:
Slowly.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.822
(grunting)

36:38.864 --> 36:40.616
Mingus Jones?

36:40.657 --> 36:42.034
Mingus is a nickname,

36:42.075 --> 36:43.243
not my legal name.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.620
My legal name is...

36:44.661 --> 36:47.289
-(groans)
-Did I ask for your life story?

36:47.331 --> 36:48.290
Hmm?

36:48.332 --> 36:51.501
(grunting)

36:51.543 --> 36:53.503
(shouts)

36:53.545 --> 36:55.631
(panting)

37:00.093 --> 37:01.762
Flushing heroin?

37:01.803 --> 37:04.222
No, sir.

37:06.308 --> 37:07.684
Moldy smell.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.437
Penicillin.

37:10.479 --> 37:13.357
That's contraband.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.025
Search it.

37:16.068 --> 37:18.695
My people have no medicine.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.657
Some of your "people" identified
you under questioning.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.825
Said you bragged

37:23.867 --> 37:25.702
-about killing Tagomi.
-Tell me,

37:25.744 --> 37:27.120
Mingus Jones.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.622
Are you BCR?

37:28.664 --> 37:30.248
I-I don't know anything
about any BCR.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.084
(chuckles)

37:32.125 --> 37:34.252
Don't you read the papers,
Mingus?

37:34.294 --> 37:37.089
The Black Communist Rebellion.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.465
No, sir.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.300
I just play jazz music.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.429
Then what is this?

37:46.056 --> 37:47.766
(panting)
No!

37:47.808 --> 37:50.560
No! No!

37:50.602 --> 37:52.771
IIJIMA:
Chinese Type 54.

37:52.813 --> 37:56.191
Same as the pistol
that shot Trade Minister Tagomi.

37:56.233 --> 37:58.986
MINGUS:
Tha-That's not mine.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.661
What else is in the drawer?

38:07.703 --> 38:09.663
Papers.

38:09.705 --> 38:12.666
Money.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.876
Books.

38:17.462 --> 38:21.758
The Autobiography
of Equiano Hampton.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.011
The founder and leader

38:24.052 --> 38:27.097
of the Black Communist
Rebellion.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.599
Never laid eyes on that book.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.019
(laughing)

38:32.060 --> 38:35.480
Who drove the bike, Mingus?

38:35.522 --> 38:36.898
Hmm?

38:36.940 --> 38:38.734
We know you were the shooter.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.110
God as my witness,

38:40.152 --> 38:43.030
I never shot anyone in my life.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.365
IIJIMA:
Who is your accomplice?!

38:45.407 --> 38:47.034
Huh?! Tell me!

38:47.075 --> 38:48.952
MINGUS:
Please, I didn't!

38:48.994 --> 38:50.120
I swear!
(shouts)

38:50.162 --> 38:51.788
IIJIMA:
Who drove the motorcycle?!

38:51.830 --> 38:53.623
(grunting)

38:53.665 --> 38:55.959
(echoing): Who?! Who drove
the motorcycle?! Tell me!

38:56.001 --> 38:58.462
(grunting continues)

39:01.173 --> 39:03.133
Who?! Tell me!

39:03.175 --> 39:05.927
-Who?!

39:05.969 --> 39:08.597
-(grunting)
-(repeats Japanese)

39:16.104 --> 39:18.148
-Corporal.
-(sniffles)

39:18.190 --> 39:21.318
Corporal.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.030
You may go.
You are not needed here.

39:31.203 --> 39:34.331
Get the suspect off the floor.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.373

40:22.212 --> 40:24.506
Daddy! Daddy, you came back!

40:24.548 --> 40:26.174
Of course I did.

40:26.216 --> 40:28.176
Think your dad
had forgotten you?

40:28.218 --> 40:31.263
Huh? No, you're my baby.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.472
Hi, Dad.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.558
SMITH:
Jennifer.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.393
My goodness,

40:36.434 --> 40:38.895
-you've grown an inch
in three months.
-(chuckles)

40:38.937 --> 40:41.064
Sorry, uh,

40:41.106 --> 40:43.275
to drop by unannounced
like this.

40:43.316 --> 40:46.278
I had some official
Reich business in the area.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.779
I thought I'd surprise you.

40:47.821 --> 40:49.197
It's not a surprise.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.407
Hank.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.159
John.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.660
Mom, can Dad stay for dinner?

40:53.702 --> 40:55.328
Of course he can, Amy.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.664
Why don't you set another place
at the table?

40:57.706 --> 41:00.125
(indistinct walkie transmission)

41:02.711 --> 41:04.171
How you been?

41:04.212 --> 41:05.589
Well, John. You?

41:05.630 --> 41:06.840
Oh, I'm good.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.175
You know.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.969
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.510
(footsteps approaching)

42:32.300 --> 42:33.927
(sighs)

42:33.969 --> 42:35.971
(quietly):
I Ching.

43:15.969 --> 43:18.138
(quietly):
Hexagram 64.

43:25.061 --> 43:28.606
Not yet complete.

43:40.035 --> 43:41.995
HANK:
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, Thy gifts...

43:42.037 --> 43:43.455
ALL:
...which we are about to receive

43:43.496 --> 43:46.207
from Thy bounty
through our Lord, God.

43:46.249 --> 43:47.751
Through our Lord, God.

43:47.792 --> 43:48.877
-ALL: Amen.
-Amen.

43:57.260 --> 44:00.263
SMITH:
Hank, uh...

44:00.305 --> 44:02.098
I wanted to thank you for...

44:02.140 --> 44:04.100
looking after Helen
and the kids all this time.

44:04.142 --> 44:07.103
I very much appreciate it.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.355
I do.

44:08.396 --> 44:10.774
Well, they're family.

44:10.815 --> 44:13.193
-They'll always have
a place here.
-Thank you.

44:20.492 --> 44:23.620
So, John,

44:23.661 --> 44:26.873
I happened to catch one of
"those films" the other night.

44:29.084 --> 44:32.712
You know, the ones where
"we" won the war.

44:35.090 --> 44:37.926
Oh, really?

44:37.967 --> 44:39.844
Where'd you see it?

44:46.643 --> 44:50.688
Their propaganda just gets
more sophisticated every day.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.486
Some people actually buy it.

45:14.379 --> 45:17.298
(TV playing indistinctly)

45:22.470 --> 45:24.097
(grunts softly)

45:52.459 --> 45:54.252
Are you all right, Father?

45:56.504 --> 45:58.840
Mm.

45:58.882 --> 46:00.758
(TV continues playing)

46:06.055 --> 46:09.225
I'm sorry I reacted
that way today.

46:15.356 --> 46:16.649
It is common for new recruits

46:16.691 --> 46:20.570
to have trouble
at the sight of blood.

46:22.030 --> 46:25.492
I've seen my share of blood
in combat.

46:28.411 --> 46:30.997
Of course.

46:31.039 --> 46:33.041
I know you have.

46:37.754 --> 46:39.214
Who is on deck?

46:40.757 --> 46:42.967
Aoki.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.344
KIDO:
Aoki.

46:44.385 --> 46:46.262
His best hope is that
the pitcher hits him.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.641
Preferably nowhere tender.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.561
(both chuckle)

46:58.316 --> 47:00.485
Make sure you get
a good night's rest

47:00.527 --> 47:05.281
for your interview
with Division Chief Otomo.

47:10.036 --> 47:13.540
You did not wear your medal
to the service.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.875
Be sure to wear it
to the interview.

47:15.917 --> 47:18.211
(thunder rumbling)

47:18.253 --> 47:20.255
He will be impressed.

47:52.537 --> 47:54.539
(door opens)

48:04.048 --> 48:06.509
LEM:
Wyatt, this is Bell.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.220
You've got five minutes.

48:09.262 --> 48:10.972
(door closes)

48:21.608 --> 48:23.151
Hey.

48:25.361 --> 48:27.572
I brought you something
from home.

48:27.614 --> 48:29.449
-(gasps) Thanks, Dad.
-Thank you.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.414
Listen, why don't you, uh,

48:36.456 --> 48:40.918
you know,
read them in your room?

48:40.960 --> 48:43.171
Me and your mom need
to have a talk.

48:47.008 --> 48:49.010
(speaks quietly)

48:56.684 --> 48:58.770
(thunder rumbling)

49:11.866 --> 49:14.577
A year goes by quickly.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.621
(Smith exhales)

49:18.998 --> 49:21.000
Well...

49:25.546 --> 49:28.591
I know you wanted some time
on your own

49:28.633 --> 49:30.426
to work through things and...

49:30.468 --> 49:31.969
Yes.

49:32.011 --> 49:34.514
So I let you have that.

49:37.558 --> 49:40.561
Now it's time to come home.

49:45.233 --> 49:47.819
You know school
has started already, Helen.

49:50.738 --> 49:53.616
Jennifer and Amy, they,
they need to be back in class.

49:53.658 --> 49:55.702
They're falling behind already.

49:55.743 --> 49:57.745
They're not falling behind.
I am teaching them.

49:57.787 --> 50:01.207
What... what is this, Helen?

50:02.625 --> 50:05.586
It's a fucking fantasy.

50:05.628 --> 50:08.464
It's a fantasy
made possible by me

50:08.506 --> 50:11.217
posting a cordon of men
all over the farm.

50:11.259 --> 50:13.052
You know I never asked for that.

50:13.094 --> 50:14.971
If it was just your life

50:15.012 --> 50:17.515
that you were putting at risk...

50:17.557 --> 50:19.684
Think. Think what
the rebels would do

50:19.726 --> 50:21.477
if they could kidnap
our daughters.

50:21.519 --> 50:23.479
They're not safe.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.982
You know it's true.

50:28.025 --> 50:31.863
There's that word, "safe."

50:31.904 --> 50:34.073
All the things you said
that we had to do

50:34.115 --> 50:37.160
to keep the children safe.

50:37.201 --> 50:40.538
But the Reich murdered our son.

50:40.580 --> 50:42.999
Don't do-- Helen, don't do that
to me, don't blame me.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.085
Every decision we made,
we made together.

50:46.127 --> 50:49.422
-Every choice. You know that.
-The girls, they did not choose.

50:49.464 --> 50:52.884
Or Thomas. Th...

50:52.925 --> 50:56.053
The Reich had poisoned his mind
long before they killed him.

50:56.095 --> 50:58.264
What's gotten into you, Helen?
What is this?

50:58.306 --> 51:00.183
Things are different
out here, John.

51:00.224 --> 51:02.018
People talk about the things

51:02.059 --> 51:04.270
that nobody talks about
in the Reich.

51:06.314 --> 51:09.066
What things?

51:11.110 --> 51:14.447
The things that you and I
were a part of.

51:14.489 --> 51:16.199
The girls, they've heard it.

51:16.240 --> 51:19.869
They ask me questions
I don't know how to answer.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.666
You got any idea what would
happen to them

51:25.708 --> 51:27.794
if they breathed a word
of that at home?

51:29.879 --> 51:31.839
(thunder rumbling)

51:31.881 --> 51:34.091
(whispers):
We're not going home.

51:37.261 --> 51:41.933
I can't go back there, John.

51:41.974 --> 51:43.935
I cannot bear it.

51:43.976 --> 51:46.187
I will lose myself.

51:46.229 --> 51:48.397
Please.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.566
Helen.

51:53.236 --> 51:55.780
We made a pact.

51:55.822 --> 51:57.657
Remember?

51:57.698 --> 52:01.786
We chose this path,
we chose it together.

52:01.828 --> 52:04.580
You and me. Huh?

52:04.622 --> 52:06.290
'Cause we believed
it was the best path.

52:09.043 --> 52:10.878
Come home.

52:12.922 --> 52:14.966
I need you.

52:19.387 --> 52:21.597
I don't even know you.

52:44.287 --> 52:46.330
Start up the plane.

52:48.583 --> 52:51.752
Girls, start packing your bags.

52:51.794 --> 52:53.379
We're leaving.

52:53.421 --> 52:54.589
John.

52:54.630 --> 52:57.049
No, John, don't do this.

52:57.091 --> 52:59.760
I think you must have known
this day was gonna come.

52:59.802 --> 53:02.513
Of course I did,
because I am powerless

53:02.555 --> 53:04.724
and you have all the power
of the Reich.

53:15.443 --> 53:17.904
(dog barking)

53:23.075 --> 53:24.785
So you're really not coming?

53:25.828 --> 53:28.205
No.

53:28.247 --> 53:30.708
HANK:
For God's sake, John.

53:30.750 --> 53:32.627
Show some decency.

53:32.668 --> 53:34.670
This is my house.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.839
-Not your fucking Reich!
-Hank. Please.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.758
-Let me handle this.
-(dog barking)

53:41.385 --> 53:42.803
SMITH:
It's okay, girls.

53:42.845 --> 53:44.180
Uh, get on the plane.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.349
I'll be along in a minute.

53:50.227 --> 53:53.689
Wh-- You're coming with us,
aren't you?

53:53.731 --> 53:55.775
Come with us, Mom, please.

54:04.951 --> 54:07.620
-Hey.
-What...?

54:07.662 --> 54:10.581
I love you so much.

54:10.623 --> 54:12.667
You know that?

54:12.708 --> 54:15.711
(crying): Your daddy's gonna
take good care of you.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.672
He loves you.

54:17.713 --> 54:21.217
I need you to look out
for each other, okay?

54:21.258 --> 54:23.844
-It's gonna be okay, I promise.
-(crying)

54:23.886 --> 54:25.137
You've got to go now, though.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.889
Go on. You've got to go now.

54:26.931 --> 54:29.350
Go on. It's okay.

54:29.392 --> 54:31.519
No, it's okay.

54:39.443 --> 54:42.655
It didn't have to
be this way, Helen.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.168
(sobbing)

54:56.210 --> 54:59.296
(engine whirring)
