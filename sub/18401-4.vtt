Mm-hmm.

00:13.926 --> 00:14.884
Empty my accounts

00:33.337 --> 00:35.209
Yeah, we'll come.
I won't.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.775

00:59.276 --> 01:01.670
You-you want to go to dinner

01:01.713 --> 01:03.019
after this?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.455
This is your fault.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.935
Sure, I can drive.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.024
What?What?

01:08.068 --> 01:08.938
What did you do?

01:08.981 --> 01:10.461

Good evening.

Hi, I'm Senior Detective
Leon Fordham.

01:14.422 --> 01:15.988
Internal Affairs.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.034
Hey. Yeah, we've met.I don't think so.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.994
No, we did. Uh, I think you
came to our car a while ago.

01:22.038 --> 01:24.040
You were having kind
of a difficult day.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.260
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

01:26.303 --> 01:29.393
Uh, no, no, you... Remember, you
invited us deep-sea fishing.

01:29.437 --> 01:32.048
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.877
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.880
So...

01:37.923 --> 01:39.882
anything you want to tell me?

01:39.925 --> 01:41.231
About...?

01:41.275 --> 01:43.407
About anything unusual
that may have occurred

01:43.451 --> 01:46.106
recently while you were on duty?

01:46.149 --> 01:48.499
Um...

01:48.543 --> 01:50.197
No, I don't think so.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.242
I believe you had an actress
in your car

01:52.286 --> 01:54.853
for a ride-along
a few nights ago?

01:54.897 --> 01:58.030
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.163
Anything unusual
happen that night?No.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.600
No, pretty standard. [chuckles]

02:02.644 --> 02:04.602
She's pretty, right?No.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.517
You don't think she's pretty?

02:06.561 --> 02:08.911
Uh...You seem confused
about her, Detective.

02:08.954 --> 02:11.261
Mm.Which I find
interesting.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.958
Because she's missing.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.526
Oh.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.181
Bombshell, right?

02:18.225 --> 02:20.052

Right.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.098
I mean, no. I mean, yes.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.709
It's not funny.
I, I'm sorry

02:24.753 --> 02:26.146
to hear that. I hope she's okay.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.973
[clears throat]

02:28.017 --> 02:30.628
Right. You want a coffee?That'd be great.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.587
Oh, I hear

02:32.630 --> 02:35.329
through the grapevine
that you applied for the FBI.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.765
Oh, yeah.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.941
That's great.
Hope this whole actress thing

02:38.984 --> 02:40.203
doesn't fuck that up for you.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.989
That was a yes
on the coffee, right?

05:22.104 --> 05:23.540
Except for the dead guy.Bad night for him.

Nathan out?

ruffled and covered in blood,

05:51.002 --> 05:52.787
but I could have sworn...So much blood.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.092
...that he, like, looked

05:54.136 --> 05:55.659
over his little
rooster shoulder at us.

05:55.703 --> 05:56.791
He 100% did.

05:56.834 --> 05:57.705
Did you see that?
Okay, you saw it.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.446
He 100% did.Yeah.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.622
I felt like he was looking at us
to say thank you.Yes.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.233
That's exactly how I felt. Yeah.Right? And I gave him
one of these

06:04.276 --> 06:06.409
right back. You know?I did, too.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.976
I know.Where is he? Right now?

06:08.019 --> 06:09.673
Where is he right now,

06:09.717 --> 06:11.632
and what is he doing?
I want to know everything.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.808
He's living a fabulous life.Really?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.636
Oh, my God, yeah. He's
probably, like, kicking back

06:15.679 --> 06:18.813
with El Chappie right now
in Puerto Rico.

06:18.856 --> 06:22.425
Experiencing some much
deserved R and R. Oh, yeah.[sighs]

06:22.469 --> 06:23.687
He's living the life.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.385
Boy, that sounds great.Yeah.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.169
How cool.
You know, we should go.I know.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.866
To Puerto Rico?Yeah.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.781
But no. I-I mean, obviously,

06:30.825 --> 06:32.087
I'm just, like, whatever.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.567
But, like, I've always wanted

06:33.610 --> 06:35.177
to go to Puerto Rico.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.700
Yeah, I mean...

06:36.744 --> 06:38.441
we could go.We...

06:38.485 --> 06:40.617
Yeah.And we could,
like, I don't know.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.010
I mean, I'm just spitballing,
but, like...

06:42.053 --> 06:44.665
what if we lived
in a tree house?

06:44.708 --> 06:46.449
Fuck you.

Hey, Leon, what's up?Good evening.

07:06.469 --> 07:09.298
I'm Senior Detective Leon
Fordham, Internal Affairs.

07:09.341 --> 07:12.083
Yeah, I know.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.434
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.131
It's me, Tolbeck.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.438
We went deep-sea fishing
together.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.614
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.616
So, what do you
want to talk about?

07:22.659 --> 07:24.922
Um... I'm not sure.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.837
Um...

07:26.881 --> 07:28.317
You know, people say

07:28.360 --> 07:31.407
you can't really make friends
as adults.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.931
What do you say
we prove them wrong?

07:33.975 --> 07:36.499
[chuckles]
Oh, okay.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
You know, I heard recently

07:38.545 --> 07:41.548
that there are more Panda
Express restaurants worldwide

07:41.591 --> 07:43.724
than there are actual pandas.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.030
You think that's true?

07:46.074 --> 07:48.337
Maybe.

07:48.380 --> 07:52.341
Um, has the interrogation
started yet?

07:52.384 --> 07:54.474
Or...Oh, yeah, we're in it. Yeah.

07:54.517 --> 07:57.389
Just feels like a super chill,
friendly hang, though, right?[chuckles]

07:57.433 --> 07:58.739
Yeah.Yeah.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.176
This is not one of
those interrogations

08:01.219 --> 08:02.873
where I try to trick you,
you know?

08:02.917 --> 08:04.919
It's not like on TV where
the bad guy suddenly slips up

08:04.962 --> 08:06.355
and admits everything.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.488
Mm-hmm.That doesn't happen
in real life.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.665
Does it?No, I guess not.

08:11.708 --> 08:15.843
Um, so, wh-what are you
interrogating me about?

08:15.886 --> 08:17.714
Oh, of course.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.760
But wait, before I forget.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.806
I got you something.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.550
Oh.Go ahead, open it.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.553
[chuckles]:
Okay.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.344
Oh.

What...?Put it on.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.958
O-Okay.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.792
That looks great on you.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.881
Thank you.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.057
Did you get me anything?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.929
Uh...I'm kidding. I know you
didn't get me anything.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.018
But what would you
have gotten me?

09:01.062 --> 09:02.498
Well, I...

09:02.542 --> 09:03.847
Oh, you know what?

09:03.891 --> 09:08.286
I have a really nice cigar

09:08.330 --> 09:10.245
that I've been carrying around.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.638
You can have it.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.596
Thank you.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.686
Arturo Cohiba.
That's an expensive cigar.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.993
Very.Well, treating yourself.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.995
And why not, right?

09:21.038 --> 09:22.257
YOLO.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.042
You only live once.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.610
I know what YOLO means,
Detective.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.831
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.

09:30.874 --> 09:33.224
Thank you for this.
It's very thoughtful.

09:33.268 --> 09:34.965
And unexpected.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.881
Well, I better get
back over to...

09:37.925 --> 09:39.883
you know.

09:39.927 --> 09:43.191
I don't want to play favorites,
because this is not a game,

09:43.234 --> 09:44.627
but...

09:44.671 --> 09:46.629
[whispers]:
you are mine.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.504
Oh, I'm gonna need
that necklace back.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.724
Could you do me a favor
and just rewrap it

09:54.768 --> 09:56.030
exactly as it was
originally wrapped?

09:56.073 --> 09:58.815
Oh. Exactly?

09:58.859 --> 10:02.079
Okay, I'll try.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.341
Thanks, pal.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.872
We can live in the tallest
tree house in town.Yes.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.525
And I can build you
a special room...

10:13.569 --> 10:14.657
Okay.
right at the tippy top

10:14.701 --> 10:15.876
of the tree house.
Yes!

10:15.919 --> 10:17.442
Yeah. Yeah.
I love that.

10:17.486 --> 10:18.879
I'm gonna lock
you up real high

10:18.922 --> 10:20.924
so no one can
ever look at you.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.447
Curious.
There's also
gonna be no door,

10:22.491 --> 10:24.449
just a slit
in the wall.
Huh.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.582
And that's where I
slide your food into.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.236
Okay.
Once a day,
small portions.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.672
Got to keep it tight.
Okay.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.761
Uh, I'm not sure

10:31.805 --> 10:35.112
about this Rapunzel-like
prison room, exactly.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.897
Why is it that I'm there?

10:36.940 --> 10:39.943
Because you're only
hungry for me.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.685
Okay, got it, got it,
got it, got it.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.862
So, I know we're just talking,

10:45.906 --> 10:47.908
but I'm into the idea

10:47.951 --> 10:51.085
of going to Puerto Rico
and hanging out.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.957
And why am I...?Shut up and kiss me
with that idiot mouth.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.263
[both moaning]

10:55.306 --> 10:57.134
Oh.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.788
Oh, Daddy likes that.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.094
Oh, yeah, Daddy does.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.704
Nope. I'm Daddy.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.098
Wait. Really?
Yes.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.013
Oh. Okay.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.971
Then... who am I?

11:08.015 --> 11:10.060
You're Daddy's baby girl.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.975
I am?You're Daddy's
beautiful...

11:12.019 --> 11:15.196
baby... girl.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.807
Oh, okay. Huh.
Mm-hmm.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.591
[whispering]:
Now shut up and kiss Daddy.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.462
Okay.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.203
[both moaning]Yeah. Mmm.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.559
[door opens]

11:30.602 --> 11:32.648
Sorry about that.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.695
Right, so...
where were we?

11:35.738 --> 11:36.783
Uh, you told me that,

11:36.826 --> 11:38.610
uh, that actress
had gone missing.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.438
Right, so do you know
where she is?

11:40.482 --> 11:42.136
No.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.312
You own or rent?Me? Uh, I rent.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.618
Smart. Yeah, you don't want
to buy in this market.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.577
Yeah.
You got a freezer
at home?

11:48.620 --> 11:50.666
Yeah.
She in it?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.494
No.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.757
You got neighbors,
nice neighbors?

11:54.801 --> 11:57.107
Yeah, they... they're
pretty good neighbors, yeah.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.718
They hear her scream
when you killed her?

11:58.761 --> 12:00.807
No, because I didn't...
I did not kill her.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.939
What about the views?
You got nice views?

12:02.983 --> 12:06.421
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I can see
the ocean from my balcony.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.683
Nice.
Yeah.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.512
Did you throw her
off the balcony?
No. No.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.775
You got a nice modern kitchen?
You like to cook?

12:12.819 --> 12:14.734
I do, but I feel like
whatever I say now,

12:14.777 --> 12:16.431
the next question's gonna be
"Did you cut her up?"

12:16.474 --> 12:17.693
Did you?
No!

12:17.737 --> 12:19.608
Hey, if the knife fits,
as they say.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.523
Who says that?
I... I-I'm... I don't...

12:21.566 --> 12:23.046
I don't know where she is.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.874
I didn't kill her,
I didn't touch her.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.442
I-I... I didn't even
know where she was from.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.314
Like, I... I didn't...
I don't know her.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.186
Uh-huh.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.364
[laughs]

12:36.407 --> 12:38.714
I'm just joshing you, Detective.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.847
We don't think
you killed her.Are you serious?

12:40.890 --> 12:42.718
Yeah, we don't even
think she's dead.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.895
Oh, God. Oh, God.[both laugh]

12:45.939 --> 12:48.463
And of course I remember you,
Detective Cullen.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.682
Oh, great.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.772
I was... I didn't...
I thought you were...

12:52.815 --> 12:54.774
I didn't... I just thought
you were embarrassed about...

12:54.817 --> 12:56.688
I didn't...
I didn't know...

12:56.732 --> 12:58.821
No, no. In fact, you should have
come deep-sea fishing

12:58.865 --> 13:00.344
with your partner and me.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.911
I mean, we had a blast.Oh, yeah.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.609
I mean, I'm sure
he told you all about it.Yeah.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.394
Yeah, he did. He did.

13:06.437 --> 13:07.830
Hey, what happened to that guy?

13:07.874 --> 13:09.832
I mean, did you ever...

13:09.876 --> 13:12.661
get closure on that guy
that you liked, or...?

13:12.704 --> 13:14.619
Guy that...?

13:14.663 --> 13:17.753
Oh, no, no. No.
I'm not gay.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.625
Oh.Yeah, I thought I was,
briefly, but, uh, I'm not.

13:20.669 --> 13:21.583
Not gay?

13:21.626 --> 13:22.584
Nope.
Oh.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.281
I was just a little confused,

13:24.325 --> 13:26.283
which is normal and natural.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.807
Yeah, totally.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.766
My wife was the one
who finally figured it all out.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.594
Hmm.
Nothing like

13:32.637 --> 13:35.205
the love of a good woman
to set you straight.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.773
So, anyway,
I'm sorry. I-I-I do.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.949
I have to ask you
these routine questions here,

13:39.993 --> 13:42.169
and I'm sorry about separating
you and your partner.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.953
Stupid protocol.It's fine.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.260
We'll see if we can get you
out of here, quick as a bunny.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.436
Okay.
I mean, as quick
as we can, given that

13:48.479 --> 13:49.698
someone has been murdered.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.265
I thought you...

13:51.308 --> 13:52.832
you just said you were
joking about that.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.529
Did I?
Yeah.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.444
Hmm. Yeah,
I guess I did.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.402
Well, you know
that old technique, right?

13:58.446 --> 14:00.491
Tell them everything's

14:00.535 --> 14:03.016
okay, see how they react.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.453
And now I've seen
how you reacted.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.717
Haven't I?

14:08.760 --> 14:11.589
Yeah.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.157
Oh.
[exclaims]

14:14.201 --> 14:16.638
Stupid me.
I forgot your coffee.

14:16.681 --> 14:17.900
Oh.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.771
[laughs]
Sorry.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.736
[door closes]

14:27.779 --> 14:29.781
Copy that. Dispatch out.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.220
[groans softly]

14:33.263 --> 14:34.786
Well?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.092
Well? Well, what?

14:36.136 --> 14:37.746
Well, how did it go?

14:37.789 --> 14:40.096
You've been gone for,
like, a half an hour,

14:40.140 --> 14:41.793
and you look much
more like yourself.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.405
Huh? Yeah.
It was nice. It was great.

14:44.448 --> 14:47.669
It was actually a nice
distraction, so thank you.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.192
You're welcome.
Mm-hmm.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.803
What'd you guys talk about?

14:51.847 --> 14:53.109
I don't know.
We didn't really...

14:53.153 --> 14:55.155
I don't remember
saying anything.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.026
I don't remember
talking at all.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.898
We just fucked.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.944
What? You-you-you had sex
with Jamal?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.641
What'd you think
we were gonna do?

15:03.685 --> 15:05.774
I told you to go have an apple.

15:05.817 --> 15:08.733
[scoffs]
"Apple" is code for "fucking."

15:08.777 --> 15:11.519
"Green apple" is code
for hand job.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.696
"Candy apple" is code
for fucking in the ass.

15:14.739 --> 15:15.958
What?! I had no idea.Yeah.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.481
Are you kidding me?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.092
That's third-grade knowledge.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.877
Wow.
Anywhoozle,
I feel a lot better.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.879
I want to thank you,
and I was thinking

15:23.923 --> 15:25.272
about you a little bit in there,

15:25.315 --> 15:27.491
so I know how
you like big staplers, so

15:27.535 --> 15:28.928
I got you a nice big black one.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.930
I do love staplers.
Mm-hmm.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.802
Oh. It's broken.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.151
Yeah.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.458
Well, I know how that happened.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.851
There's more
in the supply closet. You just

15:39.895 --> 15:41.679
might want to wait a minute,
all right?

15:41.723 --> 15:43.943
Let it air out a little bit.
[clicks tongue] Okay?

15:51.341 --> 15:53.126
Okay, you having fun?

15:53.169 --> 15:55.128
I guess.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.130
Okay, next question.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.741
What makes you angry?

15:59.784 --> 16:02.048
That's kind of
a dumb question.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.267
You know what? You... you
don't have to answer that.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.835
I tell you, if anything,
that question makes me angry.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.619
You know? Right?[laughing]

16:08.663 --> 16:09.838
[chuckling]:
Yeah.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.840
Okay, you're right.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.234
Yeah, something did
make me angry recently.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.975
Oh. What was that?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.020
Well, it was yesterday.
I was walking in Eastings Park,

16:18.064 --> 16:20.892
and, uh... beautiful day in
the... But you know what?

16:20.936 --> 16:22.198
It's always a
beautiful day here.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.200
I've been here for a
while now, and it's...

16:24.244 --> 16:27.160
It's never nota
beautiful day here.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.466
It's... it's kind of creepy.

16:29.510 --> 16:32.687
Anyway, beautiful day, and
I'm walking to the park,

16:32.730 --> 16:35.255
and I see a small crowd
gathered over there,

16:35.298 --> 16:39.433
and a couple of old guys hunched
over a board on a little table,

16:39.476 --> 16:41.609
and I'm thinking,
"Neat, some park chess."

16:41.652 --> 16:43.915
Mm."I'll go take a gander."

16:43.959 --> 16:45.917
And I-I get a little
closer, and I realize

16:45.961 --> 16:48.050
they're-they're
not playing chess.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.053
They're playing checkers.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.012
What,
are you fucking kidding me?

16:53.055 --> 16:55.449
So I said, "Hey, everyone,
I didn't get the memo.

16:55.492 --> 16:58.191
"When did society just give up?

16:58.234 --> 17:01.237
"Do you not see that we
are striding backwards?

17:01.281 --> 17:03.022
"When does this end?
When we devolve

17:03.065 --> 17:05.720
"into a-a single-celled
mindless organism

17:05.763 --> 17:09.506
and slink back
into the primordial swamp?"

17:09.550 --> 17:10.812
And then one of the
old geezers says,

17:10.855 --> 17:12.031
"Hey, I'm trying
to concentrate."

17:12.074 --> 17:13.641
And I was like,
"What the fuck are you...?

17:13.684 --> 17:15.034
"It's fucking checkers!

17:15.077 --> 17:16.905
Concentrate?
What are you, six years old?"

17:16.948 --> 17:19.864
I grabbed a handful of checkers,
I shoved 'em down his throat!

17:19.908 --> 17:22.911
His teeth came out--
his false teeth, I assume.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.218
Whatever. I don't care.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.829
And suddenly I...
The crowd turns on me.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.831
They drag me off the guy.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.398
So I... I left.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.053
I mean, I tried.
I tried...

17:34.096 --> 17:36.098
but I failed.

17:36.142 --> 17:40.102
Humanity, clearly,
has just surrendered.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.800
I mean, do we all get
our own little white flags,

17:42.844 --> 17:45.629
or is there gonna be
one big giant flag for us all?

17:45.673 --> 17:48.067
I like backgammon.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.895
Yeah, backgammon is fun.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.815
FRANKIE: Ooh.MARCO: Oh-ho.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.035
[Frankie clears throat,
Marco chuckles]

18:00.079 --> 18:01.384
That was fun.
Yeah. Yeah.

18:01.428 --> 18:04.953
Wow. This night
is full of surprises.
Yeah.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.999
I just... I got to ask, you're
okay with the daddy talk, right?

18:08.043 --> 18:09.697
Oh.
It's a dominance thing.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.438
Yeah, I guess so.
Okay.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.136
Um... Hmm. It's not like a weird
dad thing for you, is it?

18:14.180 --> 18:15.877
Oh, my God, no.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.444
We're super close, actually.

18:17.487 --> 18:18.880
Oh, good. Great.Yeah. I mean, we haven't spoken

18:18.923 --> 18:20.664
in, like... five years.
I don't know.

18:20.708 --> 18:21.970
Wait. What?![door opens]

18:22.013 --> 18:23.058
Hey, Pedro!

18:23.102 --> 18:24.538
PEDRO:
Hello.
How's it going?

18:24.581 --> 18:26.322
Going good.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.107
Take the body?Oh, yeah. They're
right over there.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.586
Thank you.
Okay.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.110
Yeah.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.940
Well...
Well...

18:35.984 --> 18:37.072
Yeah. This was, um...

18:37.116 --> 18:39.161
This was a lot of fun.Yeah.

18:39.205 --> 18:42.512
Maybe we can...
stay in touch or something?

18:42.556 --> 18:44.079
Yeah. I mean, you
have my number.
Yeah?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.951
Hey! You cool if I just cut
the body up right here?

18:46.995 --> 18:48.953
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
Knock yourself out.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.129
Thank you.
Yeah.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.131
All right.
Yeah.

18:52.174 --> 18:55.525
Maybe we can continue
to talk about our...

18:55.569 --> 18:57.266
[power saw buzzing]Puerto Rican

18:57.310 --> 19:01.096
tree house/prison fantasy?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.576
MyPuerto Rican
tree house/prison.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.143
Okay.[sawing manually]

19:04.186 --> 19:06.014
[both moaning]

19:06.057 --> 19:07.972
Okay, that's enough.Oh, o-okay.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.105
Daddy's got to go
on a work trip now.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.454
Oh, all-all right.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.717
Are you gonna miss Daddy?

19:13.761 --> 19:16.459
Um, yeah.Yeah?

19:16.503 --> 19:17.460
Then fucking say it.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.114
[power saw buzzing]

19:19.158 --> 19:21.203
I'm gonna miss you, Daddy.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.944
All right, cool.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.424
Okay.All right.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.295
I'll see you around.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.515
Okay.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.604
[chuckles]

19:30.647 --> 19:31.605
[sawing manually]

19:31.648 --> 19:33.215
[sputters, chuckles]

19:33.259 --> 19:35.217
Wow.
[chuckles]

19:35.261 --> 19:38.177
What a night, right, Pedro?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.225
Hey, I hear you're
a softball fan.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.096
Uh, I'm the, uh, batboy

19:45.140 --> 19:46.750
for the department's team.

19:46.794 --> 19:47.925
Yeah.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.450
You go to the ball games, too?

19:50.493 --> 19:53.148
Padres games? Whatever?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.150
I try to, yeah.Yeah?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.327
You stand up when you
sing the national anthem?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.155
Yes.You're patriotic, right?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.330
Yes.Hand over your heart.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.767
Cap off.Yes.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.335
It's the national anthem, right?

20:06.379 --> 20:09.164
Sing it.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.688
Uh, I don't want to sing the...

20:11.732 --> 20:12.950
I mean, you know
the song. Do you know

20:12.994 --> 20:14.996
the national anthem, Detective?

20:15.039 --> 20:16.302
Do you know the song?

20:16.345 --> 20:18.956
Yes.Sing it.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.307
Do you know the song
or did you lie,

20:21.350 --> 20:23.309

Yeah, sure.

[knocking]Hello, Chief Petite.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.952
Janice, you, uh,
close the door, please.

22:24.995 --> 22:25.953
Yep.Uh...

22:25.996 --> 22:27.650
[door closes]Jamal here

22:27.694 --> 22:30.436
has told me that,
uh, you forced him

22:30.479 --> 22:33.569
into a sexual encounter
and made him very uncomfortable.

22:33.613 --> 22:36.050
This is bullshit!Really--
Please, can you not...?

22:36.093 --> 22:37.443
That's my--
I need my phone!This is bullshit!

22:37.486 --> 22:38.792
What are you talking about?!Just...

22:38.835 --> 22:40.402
I didn't do anything!Settle down, okay?

22:40.446 --> 22:41.925
Okay,
put the gun down!

I'll do it.
What?

22:46.016 --> 22:48.802
Get off me. Get off me.
Get-- You cocksuckers!

22:48.845 --> 22:51.413
Get off me!
[screams] Get off me!

22:51.457 --> 22:52.806
Oh, no.
CHIEF:

22:55.939 --> 22:58.899
LEON: Right. Sorry
about that, Detective.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.292
Here's your coffee.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.077
Uh, do you have
any water?

23:03.120 --> 23:05.601
Unfortunately, no.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.082
[grunts]

23:08.125 --> 23:09.649
You okay?It's just--

23:09.692 --> 23:12.173
it's really hot in here.Is it?

23:12.216 --> 23:14.088
Well, the thermostat's
right there.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.742
I mean,
you could've just

23:15.785 --> 23:17.178
turned it down.Oh, I-I didn't know

23:17.221 --> 23:20.094
that I was
allowed to...Well,

23:20.137 --> 23:22.096
yeah, you're a grown-ass man.

23:22.139 --> 23:26.187
I mean, take charge
of your own destiny, right?

23:26.230 --> 23:28.276
Yeah.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.539
So, have you, uh, had a chance

23:30.583 --> 23:33.803
to remember anything
about this actress?Yes.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.805
Here it is.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.025
Uh, it started fine.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.680
It was all normal. And then, uh,
she started flirting with me,

23:40.723 --> 23:42.899
and she-she said
that I could be in her movie.

23:42.943 --> 23:45.119
And we gave her our guns and...

23:45.162 --> 23:46.773
and then she took our guns
and she was holding them

23:46.816 --> 23:48.339
against my head and she
made me eat doughnuts.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.429
And then she threatened
to kill me and--

23:50.472 --> 23:52.431
unless I begged for my life.
And so I begged for my life

23:52.474 --> 23:54.998
so she didn't shoot me.
And then she gave my gun back--

23:55.042 --> 23:57.174
and to Tolbeck as well--
and then she-- I swear to God--

23:57.218 --> 23:59.046
she left,
and I've never seen her since.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.178
That's all I know, and that is
everything that happened.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.224
I swear, that's all that h-- And
I know it's bad, but that's all.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.095
I didn't kill her.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.228
[sighs]

24:07.271 --> 24:09.883
We already know all that.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.188
You know that?

24:11.232 --> 24:12.407
Yeah.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.409
And we don't care.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.454
An actress

24:15.497 --> 24:17.151
has gone missing. Oh, no.

24:17.194 --> 24:20.110
Where will we ever find
another one?

24:20.154 --> 24:22.112
Are you asking me that?

24:22.156 --> 24:24.854
What? No,
I'm not asking you that,

24:24.898 --> 24:27.640
Detective. I don't care
about actresses, Detective.No. Right.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.860
I care about the integrity of
the San Diego Police Department.

24:30.904 --> 24:33.515
Right.Are you aware
that we are in the midst

24:33.559 --> 24:35.125
of the biggest police corruption
scandal

24:35.169 --> 24:38.433
this department has had
in the last four decades?

24:38.477 --> 24:40.087
JANICE: Get off me,
you joney motherfuckers!

24:40.130 --> 24:43.917
Don't touch me! [screams]
Get away from me!

24:43.960 --> 24:45.875
I'll give you fucking rabies,
you assholes!

24:45.919 --> 24:48.487
Stop it!Are you familiar
with the Duck Egg Test,

24:48.530 --> 24:50.750
Detective?

24:50.793 --> 24:52.055
No.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.536
If your FBI application
is successful,

24:54.580 --> 24:56.103
on your first day of training,

24:56.146 --> 24:58.366
you will be given a duck egg.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.368
From that moment forward,
you are tasked

25:00.411 --> 25:03.545
with the responsibility of the
successful hatching and raising

25:03.589 --> 25:06.853
of the little baby duck
inside that egg.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.420
While I'm training?Absolutely.

25:09.464 --> 25:13.076
You ever seen an FBI agent
order duck at a restaurant?

25:13.120 --> 25:15.470
The answer is no, Detective,
and you never will,

25:15.514 --> 25:19.474
because of the bond formed
during the Duck Egg Test.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.563
At some point during
your training, you will receive

25:21.607 --> 25:23.304
a message-- six words--

25:23.347 --> 25:26.394
"The duck is no longer viable."

25:26.437 --> 25:29.353
What does that mean?
I'm supposed to kill the duck?

25:29.397 --> 25:30.833
That's exactly right, Detective.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.226
Very good.

25:32.269 --> 25:34.228
And it is this point

25:34.271 --> 25:36.230
that three-quarters
of applicants

25:36.273 --> 25:39.189
fail their FBI training.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.364
So,

25:40.408 --> 25:43.063
what do you do?

25:43.106 --> 25:44.630
I kill the duck.Just like that?

25:44.673 --> 25:47.633
Mm-hmm.Well, then you have failed
your training.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.635
You've revealed yourself
to be a psychopath,

25:49.678 --> 25:52.159
incapable of forming
meaningful connections.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.204
That's how
they weed you out.

25:54.248 --> 25:56.293
So I-I don't
kill the duck.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.078
If you don't kill the duck,
then you've shown

25:58.121 --> 26:00.080
that you're incapable
of following orders.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.299
And you've failed
your training.

26:02.343 --> 26:04.911
So, how do I pass the test?

26:04.954 --> 26:07.000
In order
to pass the test,

26:07.043 --> 26:10.177
you need to feel something.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.397
You need to cry,
you need to scream.

26:13.441 --> 26:17.140
You need to rail
against the injustice.

26:17.184 --> 26:21.797
You need to understand what it
is to be alive on this planet,

26:21.841 --> 26:25.409
to realize that there is
no objective reality,

26:25.453 --> 26:28.195
only a vaguely agreed-upon set
of conventions

26:28.238 --> 26:31.024
that we call right and wrong.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.374
And then you need
to kill the duck.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.550
How?

26:35.594 --> 26:37.204
It's up to you.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.728
Shoot it in the face. Wring
its neck. Chop its head off.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.295
Pluck it, cook it, eat it.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.384
A lot of guys just smash it
with a brick.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.168
Whatever. It's a fucking duck.
How hard can it be?

26:45.212 --> 26:46.996
Right.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.519
Then and only then

26:48.563 --> 26:53.046
can you call yourself
an FBI agent.

26:53.089 --> 26:56.397
Okay. Okay.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.617
Your partner's on the, uh,
department softball team,

26:58.660 --> 27:00.009
is that right?

27:00.053 --> 27:02.403
Well, he's the batboy.

27:02.446 --> 27:05.014
That softball team
is the epicenter

27:05.058 --> 27:09.018
of police corruption
in San Diego.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.020
Are you s-- Tolbeck?

27:11.064 --> 27:12.674
No way.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.241
You seem very certain.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.503
Well, yeah. Yeah.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.287
He's-he's Tolbeck.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.246
How well do you know him?

27:19.289 --> 27:22.249
Too well.

27:22.292 --> 27:25.426
You haven't noticed any change
in his spending behavior?

27:25.469 --> 27:27.428
Well,

27:27.471 --> 27:30.431
actually, he has kind of been
throwing his money around a bit.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.129
He-he bought a new suit lately.

27:33.173 --> 27:34.914
We know.And shoes.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.307
