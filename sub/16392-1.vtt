02:19.807 --> 02:21.773
It's not polite to spy.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.710
I wasn't spying. I was leering.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.312
You know, this thing
reinforces bad viewing habits.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.481
You should learn to look
at a woman as a whole.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.700
Hey, listen.

02:31.701 --> 02:33.918
I'm way too enlightened
to look at women like that.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.821
I meant as opposed to just half.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.892
It's a periscope in a bar. Lighten up.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.527
You just shouldn't look
at women as objects.

02:41.529 --> 02:45.731
Oh, no. You see, I was
looking at women objectively.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.267
You know, I don't care for semantics.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.236
Hmm. Too bad. I'm Jewish.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.866
Hey, can I buy you a drink?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.776
I don't think so.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.611
The... the whole you?

03:01.815 --> 03:02.881
Ow.

03:04.451 --> 03:07.219
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

03:07.922 --> 03:12.558
- Trouble, skipper?
- Uh, flesh wound.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.894
There we go. That's much better.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.396
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.864
Medicinal purposes.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.402
Hi!

03:23.404 --> 03:25.404
Hey. Oh, you look great.
I've never seen this.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.940
Yes. Well, I can hide
a small child in this.

03:27.942 --> 03:31.310
So you should go for it.
Little dimples, little ass.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.644
Little potential.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.646
You and your potential quotient.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.916
Have you got some sort of
potential-calculator device in your head?

03:37.918 --> 03:41.553
- I mean, how do you know?
- Zoe, I know the type.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.959
I am in love with that girl.

03:48.462 --> 03:53.332
David, that girl intended and
inflicted bodily injury on you.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.866
You don't marry girls like that.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.735
You file restraining
orders against them.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.606
- Ho. Spider sense tingling.
- Where?

04:00.608 --> 04:04.009
<i>Don't look. 3:00. Don't look!</i>

04:04.011 --> 04:06.011
I'm sensing a Germanic accent.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.247
Swedish. Stewardesses, maybe.

04:08.249 --> 04:11.350
Uh, secretaries. German
bank upstairs. Ah.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.818
Two Beck's. Two Beck's.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.060
Cover me. I'm going in.

04:17.491 --> 04:22.861
One more furtive glance between you
two, and I will spew piña colada.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.599
<i>He is cute.</i>

04:28.936 --> 04:30.902
<i>I was sitting down the end of the bar,</i>

04:30.904 --> 04:32.721
and I was thinking, "Jeez.

04:32.722 --> 04:34.539
I've never met a European
woman who didn't like beer."

04:34.541 --> 04:36.541
I've got two. Is this perfect?

04:36.543 --> 04:37.876
One for you and one for you.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.878
Now, if you don't
like beer, that's fine.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.449
Could be now is a good time for beer.

04:46.820 --> 04:51.490
For all you know, he may be the sweetest,
most sensitive, evolved guy on the planet.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.796
I like dark beer, actually.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.158
Hanna, Marta, this is
my, uh, good friend David.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.803
- Then again...
- Let's go.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.873
So, uh, you're both secretaries.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.409
No... tellers. Munchen Bank.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.910
I bank there. Yeah.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.005
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:13.030 --> 05:17.354
Last week. I, uh, you broke a
Deutschemark for me. Do... do you remember?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.651
No. Mnh-mnh.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.921
So, here it is, Friday
night. Early Friday night.

05:22.923 --> 05:26.842
And I'm sure it's only a matter of time
before you revert to shelter mentality...

05:26.843 --> 05:29.094
- ...and say something like...
- I'm so tired. I just want to go home.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.796
Exactly.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.865
Zoe, any guy you meet in a
bar picks up women in bars.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.034
Therefore, I can safely
rule out that guy,

05:36.036 --> 05:38.937
as cute as he may have been,
just based on the general theory

05:38.939 --> 05:40.806
of guilt by geographic association.

05:40.808 --> 05:44.676
Then I have to ask you, what
were we doing in the bar?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.512
We were having a drink.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.415
Okay. We were spending
some time together.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.585
- We live together.
- All right, Zoe. Okay.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.419
We were scoping and scamming,
just like everybody else.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.923
- Are you happy?
- Was that so hard?

05:57.925 --> 05:59.658
Oh.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.828
<i>Red line outbound. Next
stop, Harvard square.</i>

06:04.064 --> 06:07.799
Oh, perfect. Ten of my
favorite pickup lines,

06:07.801 --> 06:11.403
25 bucks worth of drinks,
a whole lot of wasted charm

06:11.405 --> 06:13.805
only to find out that
Hanna and Marta were lovers.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.458
- I hate that.
- Yeah. Go figure.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.942
Well, the night's not a total wash, huh?

06:17.945 --> 06:20.112
We'll go catch a little Joe
down at the Cantab Lounge.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.847
- What do you say?
- Oh, great. Great.

06:21.849 --> 06:25.550
Oh, please tell me you've
gotten over the finger crusher.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.652
Yeah, well...

06:27.654 --> 06:30.822
- The memory lingers a bit, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.824
But you've got the answer
for that, don't you?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.893
Sure, I do.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.961
We erase that memory by
staying out all night,

06:36.964 --> 06:38.897
destroying our brain cells with alcohol

06:38.899 --> 06:40.165
and sociopathic behavior.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.702
Easy solutions to life's
difficult problems.

06:43.704 --> 06:47.773
- I feel better.
- Of course you do.

06:47.775 --> 06:52.978
So we stayed out all night and drank
Tequila, and neither one of us scored.

06:52.980 --> 06:58.483
I, uh, of course, succeeded in the
research-and-development department.

06:59.753 --> 07:04.656
Andrea. Mm-hmm.
652-94...

07:04.658 --> 07:07.492
I don't remember Andrea.

07:07.494 --> 07:11.663
Aha. Yeah. Mimi. Mimi, I remember.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.000
627-43...

07:15.002 --> 07:17.669
I don't remember Mimi.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.639
That's the problem with Tequila.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.107
Mimi.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.767
- What?
<i>- Light beer?</i>

08:22.769 --> 08:24.836

08:36.917 --> 08:41.019
No, I wish. Red hair, blue top.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.820

Tigger, too, from last night.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.408
- No.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.958
<i>How many chicks have the joker's hair?</i>

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
- Joker has green hair, asshole.
- Cracker Jacks here. Cracker Jacks.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.229
- What did I say?
- Garcon!

08:51.231 --> 08:53.598
Cracker Jacks. Cracker Jacks.
Um, yeah. Cracker Jack here.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.767
All right. Hey, Cracker
Jacks, everybody.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.202
Peanuts, Cracker Jacks a buck.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.737
You got any Cracker Jack?

08:58.739 --> 08:59.905
- Give me a minute here.
- Plenty of Cracker Jacks.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.108
Anybody for peanuts and Cracker Jacks?

09:03.110 --> 09:06.111
Yeah. Yeah!

09:06.113 --> 09:09.581
All right. Now, listen. Do me a favor.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.918
Bring this down, please,
to that lady in blue.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.819
What do I look like, a freakin' mailman?

09:14.821 --> 09:20.325
- Here. Look. Buy yourself a beer.
- Hey. Special delivery.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.061
Look. They're not
even watching the game.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.598
It looks like they're checking
out Bruno's back. Look.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.768
<i>- Come on, batter!
- Play ball!</i>

09:29.770 --> 09:32.237
Okay. I bet she goes for
the toy surprise first.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.240
- What's this?
- What do I know? Secret admirer.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.845
- Secret admirer.
- Wow!

09:40.847 --> 09:44.182
Come on! Come on!

09:47.721 --> 09:50.021
That's hysterical!

10:00.300 --> 10:04.002
- They're back.
- And they're really dorky-looking.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.004
And they're right behind
you. How about that, huh?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.273
Oh, you know, you really
shouldn't look at men like this.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.710
It's demeaning. Visual
dismemberment, remember?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.813
All right, lighten up. It's
just a day at the ball park.

10:14.815 --> 10:18.683
I think I'm gonna have to give the nod to
Mattingly for the best seat in the majors.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.852
Are you nuts? What about Bo?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.988
I mean, are we talking
size or shape here?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.724
I think I'm secure
enough in my own sexuality

10:25.726 --> 10:28.693
to say that Mattingly's ass
kicks ass on any other ass.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.862
You are so enlightened.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.798
- Uh, I'm David.
- Carrie.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.836
- Eli Mattingly. How are you?
- Hi. I'm Zoe.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.939
- I see you brought a glove.
- Um, it's Zoe's.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.108
We could tell. It kind
of matches her hair.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.877
Oh! Well, if it were skin tone,

10:45.879 --> 10:48.013
I guess I could say the
same thing about you.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.248
Ouch. A hair-loss joke. Very good.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.917
Luckily for me, women are very
attracted to a receding hairline.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.222
- Oh, I don't think so.
- I said <i>women.</i>

10:57.224 --> 11:00.191
You know, if you're
gonna make the catch, um,

11:00.193 --> 11:02.961
it's easier if you do it like this.

11:02.963 --> 11:03.928
- Yeah.
- There you go.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.931
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

11:06.933 --> 11:10.769
Course, I don't think there's gonna
be any homers with the wind blowing in.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.073
Oh!

11:17.310 --> 11:18.977
Great grab.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.846
Of course, when you hit
it that hard, you know,

11:21.848 --> 11:24.082
cuts right through that wind.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.851
Throw it back! Throw it back!

11:26.853 --> 11:28.486
Throw it back!

11:28.487 --> 11:30.120
House rules... Bleacher
etiquette dictates

11:30.123 --> 11:33.024
that you got to throw back
a homer by the opposition.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.728
Throw it back! Throw
it back! Throw it back!

11:36.730 --> 11:40.365
Yes! A woman after my own heart.

11:40.367 --> 11:45.203
So, um, how about an autograph
and, uh, phone number?

11:45.205 --> 11:49.774
- It was on the ball. Yeah.
- No.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.310
No!

11:53.780 --> 11:54.846
No!

11:54.848 --> 11:55.847
Ohh!

11:55.849 --> 11:59.150
- Ah, chill, babe. It ain't over.
- It's over.

11:59.152 --> 12:03.755
- No, it isn't. Lick me.
- What are we, Siegfried and Roy?

12:03.757 --> 12:06.291
Aw! Ick!

12:07.828 --> 12:13.264
- And? <i>Voilà.</i>
<i>- Hmm.</i>

12:14.935 --> 12:17.402
So I give the number
on the tattoo to Eli.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.903
I thought it would be a laugh.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.506
And what happens? David calls Carrie.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.341
Carrie blows up at me.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.411
See, she thinks David
is hugely unimpressive.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.914
So I go, "Fine. If David
is so hugely unimpressive,

12:29.916 --> 12:32.784
why have you accepted his
invitation to the movies?"

12:32.786 --> 12:35.320
So she goes, "Well, I
felt sorry for the guy.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.021
He sounded so desperate."

12:37.023 --> 12:42.160
Then she locks herself in the bathroom
and removes all superfluous body hair.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.329
I'm worried.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.969
The three F's of dating...

12:50.971 --> 12:53.037
One... film, two... food,

12:53.039 --> 12:55.940
- three... fuck.
- Can you write that down?

12:55.942 --> 12:57.942
You'll remember. You're gonna be fine.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.863
- And you're gonna need this.
- What's that?

13:01.864 --> 13:03.814
- Remember how Batman had a utility belt?
- Yeah.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.317
Yeah, well, he should've had one of
these. He would've done a lot better.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.053
I got everything you need
for the date, all right?

13:09.055 --> 13:11.055
I got a tongue depressor in here.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.892
- I got a little dental dam here for you.
- What is that?

13:13.894 --> 13:16.394
Safe sex includes our
dear friend fellatio.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.862
- Hiya.
- Hi.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.329
<i>Where do you get this stuff?</i>

13:19.332 --> 13:21.800
Remember the dental
hygienist I was dating?

13:21.802 --> 13:24.436
Kept a few samples.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.071
Now, the condoms are from
my own personal stock, huh?

13:27.073 --> 13:28.439
The good stuff.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.976
Eli, look, it's... It's a first date.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.046
It's, well, my future wife.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.549
We have film? Yes.

13:37.551 --> 13:40.018
Food? Probably.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.020
Anything else after
that, I can't really say.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.189
All right.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.670
Worst comes to worst,
you make balloon animals.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.296
- So I haven't been to a movie
- So, what do you, uh...

13:51.298 --> 13:53.298
So, uh... I'm sorry.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.999
No, sorry. What?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.135
No, just... you haven't
been to a movie, or...

13:57.137 --> 13:58.903
No, what were you gonna say?

13:58.905 --> 14:03.274
Um, uh, what... what do
you do? That, actually.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.577
Mm. I work for the mayor.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.512
Our mayor?

14:07.514 --> 14:11.616
Your mayor. I-I work in his
office. I mean, for his office.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.085
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

14:14.087 --> 14:16.187
Sounds... sounds impressive.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.223
It's not.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.991
Well, I'm impressed.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.459
Yeah?

14:21.461 --> 14:24.462
Well, you're easily impressed.
I like that in a man.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.432
<i>I'll remember that.</i>

14:32.072 --> 14:35.907
<i>- This guy is kicking my seat.
- Oh, I hate that.</i>

14:37.410 --> 14:39.577
Hey, could you just knock it off?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.112
Knock what off?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.281
- Well, anyway, you see that guy there?
- Yeah.

14:43.283 --> 14:47.018
- Are they bothering you?
- Do you want to move?

14:47.020 --> 14:49.387
No.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.156
Hey. Why bother whispering?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.098
<i>♪ Oh, darling... ♪</i>

15:00.100 --> 15:02.567
<i>Talk about violence in the movies.</i>

15:02.569 --> 15:05.003
<i>Boy, your eye is really swollen.</i>

15:05.005 --> 15:08.072
You know, you should've told
me. We wouldn't have stayed.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.074
No, no, no. It's... glancing blow.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.544
- I wanted you to see the movie.
- Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.916
- Ooh. Is that better?
- Considerably.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.550
Thanks.

15:24.925 --> 15:29.093
<i>So, um... What are you gonna have?</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:30.962
Uh...

15:30.964 --> 15:32.297
Strudel sounds good.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.966
Oh, no. No. You never order the strudel.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.970
See, restaurants always are out of it,
so they try and push the cheesecake on you

15:38.972 --> 15:40.438
'cause they have too much of that.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.976
- You ready?
- Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have the strudel.

15:44.978 --> 15:48.346
- We're out.
- Well, gee, what do you recommend?

15:48.348 --> 15:51.115
Cheesecake is good.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.450
- Soup.
- Soup.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.019
- Large bowl?
- Two spoons.

15:55.021 --> 15:56.621
Hmm. How romantic.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.223
I'm charging you for the extra spoon.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.625
I'll splurge.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.631
So, what did you call
those things in the soup?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.467
- You're not Jewish, are you?
- No.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.135
I'm from Wellesley,

16:11.137 --> 16:15.206
a suburb rivaled only by Green
Acres in ethnic diversity.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.641
Okay. All right.

16:16.643 --> 16:21.179
Well, the little round things are called matzo
balls, or knaidlach, called by my people.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.215
Um, little ravioli things
are called kreplach,

16:24.217 --> 16:26.751
invented while we were wandering in
the desert and needed something to eat

16:26.753 --> 16:28.720
after throwing all the
knaidlach at our enemies.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.991
I knew that.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.394
Well, thanks for seeing my movie.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.062
- Sure.
- Did you like it?

16:38.064 --> 16:40.365
Uh, no.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.533
I-I liked you.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.070
<i>The way that you laughed
at all the wrong stuff.</i>

16:46.072 --> 16:49.173
<i>And cried with her.</i>

16:50.777 --> 16:53.277
You're not cynical.

16:55.048 --> 16:58.149
You surrendered yourself to the story.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.686
<i>I like that.</i>

17:11.263 --> 17:13.681
Um, you know, David,

17:13.682 --> 17:16.098
I-I don't think that we should
get into anything physical.

17:16.102 --> 17:19.604
Ow! Ooh. That hurts.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.306
That's one of those cliché lines
they teach them to say in <i>Cosmo,</i>

17:22.308 --> 17:23.641
and she just fired it right at him.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.926
Real nice.

17:25.928 --> 17:28.212
I mean, the guy just wanted
a kiss, not <i>The Story of O.</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:31.382
I-I didn't...

17:31.384 --> 17:33.451
Could you please repeat that?

17:34.754 --> 17:37.555
I just don't think we
should rush into anything.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.127
- What changed your mind?
- I started kissing you.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.200
- What was that?
- The lamp.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.069
Oh.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.072
- What was that?
- Cat.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.073
Oh.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.842
W-whoa!

18:01.281 --> 18:04.115
- Haagen-dazs?
- Don't panic, dude.

18:04.117 --> 18:07.785
We're like hell's angels.
We share everything.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.307
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.175
M-maybe we can fix it or something.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.111
That's my parents' wedding picture.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.412
It's 35 years old.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.347
Shit.

18:36.349 --> 18:41.619
- Well, maybe we can glue it or... something.
<i>- I'll be right back.</i>

18:44.457 --> 18:47.692
<i>Keep away from my precious daughter.</i>

18:47.694 --> 18:51.546
<i>- Kenneth, they're just necking.
- Oh, yes?</i>

18:51.547 --> 18:55.366
<i>Well, maybe we better check the
contents of his bat utility belt.</i>

18:55.368 --> 18:59.237
With all due respect, sir,
we are consenting adults.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.840
<i>Carrie is an adult,
and you are consenting.</i>

19:02.842 --> 19:06.811
<i>My daughter is not going to be
another one of your little conquests.</i>

19:06.813 --> 19:09.847
<i>- Do you hear me, young man?
- Kenneth.</i>

19:09.849 --> 19:11.649
<i>David, I'm sorry, but, um...</i>

19:13.153 --> 19:16.220
It's late, and I have to
be at aerobics at 5:30.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.388
- A.M.?
- Mm-hmm.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.557
Bryant Gumbel sleeps later than that.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.894
No. I-I understand.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.228
It's...

19:24.230 --> 19:28.566
- Um, here.
- Thanks.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.801
I'm kind of tired myself.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.306
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.814
Gentlemen, we came, we
saw, we kicked pomboose.

19:43.816 --> 19:47.351
Ah. Next week, try 5:00,
5:30. Any questions?

19:47.353 --> 19:50.221
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crown's date
...Uh, recap, inning by inning.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.722
We lucked out in this market, babe.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.391
Oh, we got duffed.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.594
Suffice to say, I haven't seen
any balloon-animal giraffes

19:56.596 --> 19:58.362
roaming the streets of our fair town.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.830
This Carrie chick... What does she do?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.699
Uh, mayor's office.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.534
Uh, speech-writing,
fund-raising...

20:03.536 --> 20:05.536
- ...staff work for the mayor.
- Hey, can she fix my parking tickets?

20:05.538 --> 20:06.737
Can she fix me up?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.706
Ooh. You should see this chick, man.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.375
- Brunette, baby blues.
- Hey.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.877
- Titties?
- Nice.

20:14.214 --> 20:17.448
Very nice. Perhaps the perfect woman.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.384
- Eli, gentlemen.
- Uh-huh.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.977
Now, the perfect woman is
more than simply a genetically

20:24.002 --> 20:26.224
desirable combination of tits and ass.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.859
Oh, at last... a real man.

20:28.861 --> 20:32.630
She's also rich, cooks,
and pees standing up.

20:32.632 --> 20:33.931
Pigs.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.271
I feel terrible about this.

20:40.273 --> 20:44.008
I mean, you suppose Carrie and her friends
are sitting around, schmoozing like this?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.910
What, do you think she's a cheerleader?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.813
She's not sitting around like
Olivia Newton-John in <i>Grease,</i> pal.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.881
<i>♪ Tell me more, tell me more ♪</i>

20:50.883 --> 20:52.883
<i>♪ Was it love at first sight? ♪</i>

20:58.524 --> 21:00.625
<i>Solid shot on the left-hand lane.</i>

21:00.627 --> 21:01.993
<i>So Ferraro, who's playing a little...</i>

21:01.995 --> 21:03.894
<i>You gonna call her?</i>

21:03.896 --> 21:06.264
- Hmm?
- Carrie chick.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.934
Maybe. Just maybe.

21:12.038 --> 21:15.773
You know, Care, there's no rule
that says you can't call him.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.909
You realize, of course,
there's only two scenarios here.

21:18.911 --> 21:22.280
If you got laid, there's
no reason to call her again.

21:22.282 --> 21:25.583
And if you didn't, no
reason to call her again.

21:25.585 --> 21:31.255
<i>The beach master is the most
respected and exalted of all the males.</i>

21:31.256 --> 21:33.690
<i>But notice when the
female enters his focuses,</i>

21:33.693 --> 21:38.963
<i>even the revered beach master
is struck by innate awkwardness.</i>

21:38.965 --> 21:42.400
<i>All he does now is lie there, inert,</i>

21:42.402 --> 21:44.902
<i>like a giant bowl of marmalade,</i>

21:44.904 --> 21:48.572
<i>while she waits... and waits...</i>

21:48.574 --> 21:49.907
<i>And waits.</i>

21:49.909 --> 21:55.346
<i>The female understands this ritual. But
that does not make it any easier for her.</i>

21:55.348 --> 21:59.383
<i>As the beach master feigns
supposed indifference,</i>

21:59.385 --> 22:06.490
<i>this stalemate can only be broken if he
and she leave their respective fields,</i>

22:06.492 --> 22:11.780
<i>And meet in a neutral area, perhaps
here, in the ocean's icy depths...</i>

22:11.805 --> 22:12.930
<i>...to frolic.</i>

22:17.970 --> 22:21.839
- One of my favorites.
- Yeah, me too.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.508
- Its <i>Colors,</i> right?
- No, no.

22:24.510 --> 22:28.112
It's just that whenever I've been scalped
with a particularly treacherous haircut,

22:28.114 --> 22:29.947
I check out the Vin-Man's do.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.817
Come on. The guy could
care less about appearances.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.486
I mean, the way he perceived
the world in his mind,

22:35.488 --> 22:36.654
he... he was a genius.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.056
Yeah, agreed, albeit
a sick, nutty genius.

22:39.058 --> 22:43.247
This is a guy who lopped off his ear
and federal-expressed it to his honey.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.967
Vinny, babe, what
were you thinking, huh?

22:49.969 --> 22:51.836
Walk with me. Talk to me.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.904
You don't cut off anything for anybody.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.941
Not above the waist, not
below. It ain't worth it.

22:56.943 --> 23:00.111
Do you remember Samson at all?

23:00.113 --> 23:02.480
I don't care if
Michelle fucking Pfeiffer

23:02.482 --> 23:04.582
and Madonna want to give
you a pedicure and a trim.

23:04.584 --> 23:07.451
The answer is no. No can do.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.620
<i>Yeah. O-okay.</i>

23:09.622 --> 23:12.423
<i>Look, I really don't think
it's a mistake on our part.</i>

23:12.425 --> 23:15.126
<i>But if it is, you can be sure
I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

23:17.463 --> 23:21.465
<i>Yeah, zoning law
passed on July 14, 1973.</i>

23:21.467 --> 23:23.134
Next time you don't do your homework,

23:23.136 --> 23:25.536
bring a note from your mother.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.038
<i>All right. Terrific.</i>

23:29.041 --> 23:30.608
Fax me.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.727
All right. I want a
Turkey on whole wheat.

23:32.728 --> 23:34.845
<i>Tell Linda whatever you want. We'll go
through the North End as we eat, okay?</i>

23:34.847 --> 23:38.015
- Hey, David.
- I thought I'd take you out to lunch.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.885
Oh, I'm sorry. Adam, did you meet David?

23:40.887 --> 23:42.019
No.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.889
- Nice to meet you.
<i>- How are you?</i>

23:44.891 --> 23:46.891
I would love to, but I
got so much to do, hon.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.893
Why don't you go ahead?
I'll take care of it.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.896
No, no. It's okay. I-I understand.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.932
Okay. Sorry.

23:57.703 --> 24:00.504
Hey, how about a movie tonight?

24:00.506 --> 24:01.672
Is Adam coming?

24:01.674 --> 24:05.576
He'd love to, but Thursday
nights is his gay-rights meeting.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.012
- Really?
- No.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.448
But I thought it'd make you feel better.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.411
- Coffee? That's all? Coffee?
- Yes, coffee.

24:23.412 --> 24:24.829
- The stuff from Brazil?
- In a cup?

24:24.831 --> 24:27.131
You know, I'd also like to have the...

24:27.133 --> 24:28.833
Never mind.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.968
There's a $2.50 minimum per person.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.571
We understand and
accept your conditions.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.474
I never liked you.

24:36.476 --> 24:39.009
Yes, we know that. And that's okay.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.915
Why didn't you let me order?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.690
Strudel! Your own recipe?

24:52.692 --> 24:54.225
Entenmann's.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.230
Oh!

24:59.232 --> 25:01.112
- New lamp.
- Oh.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.002
Same cat?

25:08.140 --> 25:09.139
- Oh!
- Oh!

25:12.178 --> 25:14.011
Wait. No roommate?

25:14.013 --> 25:18.749
- Zoe's gone the whole weekend.
- Let's get the Haagen-dazs.

25:26.893 --> 25:30.027
- Here. There.
- Where?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.564
And this is supposed to prove...?

25:33.566 --> 25:35.733
How gullible you are after great sex.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.568
Yeah? And you need proof?

25:37.570 --> 25:41.839
Actually, the melting point will
determine the hottest part of your body...

25:41.841 --> 25:45.009
- And, thus, the most susceptible.
- Oh, come on! It's running!

25:45.011 --> 25:48.012
- The most sensitive.
- David, these are new sheets.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.714
The most erogenous.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.717
This is like some bizarre
checkup from Mr. Freeze.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.853
Wait till you see my bill.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.990
<i>If you fuck her, she will come.</i>

26:02.862 --> 26:05.863
Stop. Stop.

26:05.865 --> 26:09.199
<i>If you fuck her, she will come.</i>

26:09.201 --> 26:11.201
Oh.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.736
<i>Psst.</i>

26:12.738 --> 26:15.739
<i>Psst. David! Listen up.</i>

26:15.741 --> 26:17.374
Champ, you looked good.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.008
You looked good. It
was great, wonderful.

26:19.009 --> 26:20.642
Right now you're in the
grips of her hormonal madness,

26:20.643 --> 26:22.276
which is good. Don't get me
wrong. It's a lot of fun to watch.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.982
<i>Just don't get carried away
here, okay? This is business.</i>

26:24.984 --> 26:27.284
All right? Stick and
move. Stick and move.

26:27.286 --> 26:30.054
I mean, don't let your emotions
get the better of you here.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.856
<i>Very important. And, David...</i>

26:32.858 --> 26:37.595
Whatever you do, do not... I
repeat... do not spend the night.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.000
Either I've developed a
horrible scalp problem...

26:43.002 --> 26:45.903
or I have rum raisin all in my hair.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.938
Oh, here. Let me do it.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.674
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.114
- How's that?
- Mmm...

26:57.116 --> 27:01.952
- Oh, you like that?
- Mm-hmm.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.826
I remember when I was little...

27:08.828 --> 27:12.663
my dad used to do this for
me when I couldn't sleep.

27:12.665 --> 27:15.399
Would you do this for me every night?

27:15.401 --> 27:18.235
Comb her hair every
night? What am I, nuts?

27:18.237 --> 27:23.240
The implication of that
question is downright unnerving.

27:23.242 --> 27:27.978
But you know, sometimes you...
just can't help yourself.

27:29.048 --> 27:32.916
I mean, you got to say what you feel.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.953
Sometimes it... it just comes out.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.029
Absolutely.

27:45.031 --> 27:48.198
I would do this for you every night.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.318
That's right.

28:00.343 --> 28:04.637
We call the following stage in this
new relationship "the sickening phase,"

28:04.662 --> 28:09.321
during which he doesn't care if she
window-shops for 3 1/2 hours nonstop,

28:09.346 --> 28:13.724
and she suddenly loves to measure
the firing gap in his spark plugs.

28:13.726 --> 28:18.895
And they feed each other and stroll
together with these "Kumbaya" smiles,

28:18.898 --> 28:22.933
and when they do actually
speak, it's that baby talk.

28:22.935 --> 28:26.904
You know the baby talk you
share only with your loved one,

28:26.906 --> 28:30.441
'cause you know that shit don't
fly at work with your buddies.

28:30.443 --> 28:33.911
<i>The rigors of courtship completed,</i>

28:33.913 --> 28:36.814
<i>all animals enjoy a period of bliss,</i>

28:36.816 --> 28:38.449
<i>known as "the sickening phase."</i>

28:38.451 --> 28:43.387
<i>Here are the zebra,
the penguin, the ape.</i>

28:43.389 --> 28:48.242
<i>Perhaps the most intriguing species
to observe during this phase...</i>

28:48.267 --> 28:51.912
<i>...is the human being. The couple.</i>

28:51.913 --> 28:55.466
<i>Here we see them deriving mutual
pleasures from feeding ducks.</i>

28:55.468 --> 28:57.618
<i>Oops.</i>

28:57.619 --> 28:59.819
<i>They have sensed our camera's presence.</i>

29:00.740 --> 29:03.307
<i>They have decided to move on.</i>

29:03.309 --> 29:07.044
<i>Here we see them walking
arm in arm down a path,</i>

29:07.046 --> 29:09.847
<i>and... no. W-we are scientists.</i>

29:09.849 --> 29:11.315
<i>We are from nature films!</i>

29:11.317 --> 29:12.783
<i>We... oh! I'm s...</i>

29:12.785 --> 29:13.984
<i>Oh, shit! Mad!</i>

29:13.986 --> 29:15.919
<i>Oh, God! Philippe!</i>

29:15.921 --> 29:17.971
<i>Cut.</i>

29:17.972 --> 29:20.022
Another salient
characteristic of this phase...

29:20.025 --> 29:24.394
The loyal friends of the afflicted
couple may as well drop off the planet.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.256
I mean, forget midnight pig-outs,

29:26.281 --> 29:29.081
when the only thing that kept
you from joining a convent...

29:29.106 --> 29:31.835
was four bags of garlic potato
chips and your best friend.

29:31.837 --> 29:33.270
Forget your best friend.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.974
I mean, she's a Siamese
twin, and three's a crowd.

29:37.877 --> 29:41.411
Of course, she still
has to meet his friends.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.218
So, how long have you known David?

29:48.220 --> 29:50.053
Oh, David?

29:50.055 --> 29:52.156
Uh, David's one of my
oldest and closest friends.

29:52.158 --> 29:55.459
I mean, he's a really, really great guy.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.195
I mean, you're really
lucky to have snagged him.

29:58.197 --> 30:01.999
- I mean, he's a great guy, really.
- Yeah, I know.

30:02.001 --> 30:07.888
- Good friend, great guy. I mean it.
- I believe you.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.939
That's why it hurts me so much
that I have to ask you out.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.625
Excuse me?

30:11.626 --> 30:15.479
Normally, I would think twice about
hitting on a friend's chick like this.

30:15.481 --> 30:19.183
But, Carrie, you're just
too awesome to let go.

30:21.287 --> 30:25.389
- Let go.
- Hmm.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.494
- Mm, what do you got there?
- Drop dead.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.563
<i>♪ You know I like it ♪</i>

30:32.565 --> 30:35.933
<i>♪ I like it, I like it ♪</i>

30:35.935 --> 30:38.335
<i>♪ You know I like it ♪</i>

30:38.337 --> 30:41.071
<i>♪ I like it, and I love you so ♪</i>

30:41.073 --> 30:42.406
What are you doing?

30:42.408 --> 30:44.975
Oh, I gotta judge the
perfect-breast competition.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.543
What do you think?

30:46.545 --> 30:51.114
Well, I don't think that there, um...
should be chocolate-chip cookies.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.449
You're right. They're too small.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.085
Hey, can I get a couple
cupcakes down here?!

30:55.087 --> 30:57.554
<i>♪ Feel it, feel it ♪</i>

30:57.556 --> 31:00.357
<i>♪ Baby, let me feel it ♪</i>

31:00.359 --> 31:03.026

31:03.028 --> 31:05.395
<i>♪ In my soul ♪</i>

31:05.397 --> 31:07.464
Friendly face at last.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.300
<i>- ♪ Feel it in my soul ♪</i>
- Hiya.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.302
Hey, well, what are you making?

31:12.304 --> 31:15.005
Well, you know, they have their
perfect-breast competition,

31:15.007 --> 31:17.241
so I thought I'd sculpt
the perfect penis.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.644
- Isn't it a dream come true?
- Hey!

31:20.646 --> 31:22.279
<i>♪ You know I like it ♪</i>

31:22.281 --> 31:23.914
<i>♪ I like it ♪</i>

31:23.916 --> 31:26.383
Fellas! Look!

31:26.385 --> 31:29.920
Looks like something out
of <i>Dune.</i> Nice job, Zoe.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.154
- Hey, you.
- No.

31:31.156 --> 31:33.557
Yes. We need more
bodies for strip twister.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.892
- Zoe!
- Yes!

31:34.894 --> 31:36.093
Aaah!

31:36.095 --> 31:38.028
So jealous.

31:38.898 --> 31:41.899
Hey, wait for me! I'm double-jointed!

31:41.901 --> 31:44.234
Wait! I can do amazing things!

31:44.236 --> 31:47.938
<i>Right hand, blue. Left hand, yellow.</i>

31:47.940 --> 31:50.574
Very nice.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.209
Babies. You see, I'm a guy
who knows a lot about babies.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.013
<i>♪ I want to love somebody ♪</i>

31:56.015 --> 31:59.216
I'm not having a good time.

31:59.218 --> 32:02.185
Oh, was Eli cheating again?

32:02.187 --> 32:07.124
You know, you cannot trust that guy
to call a clean round of strip twister.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.026
Yeah, he made up the colors.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.628
Well, you see, he's
color-blind like a, you know...

32:11.630 --> 32:13.797
Like a schnauzer.

32:13.798 --> 32:17.434
And then he brings over this cooler
full of ice water and... dumps it on me.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.037
See, you gotta hose down
the board between games.

32:20.039 --> 32:22.639
Otherwise, it gets all gritty.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.508
- And, David...
- Yeah?

32:24.510 --> 32:30.013
- One of your friends keeps hitting on me.
- What? Who is it? Point him out.

32:31.016 --> 32:34.800
- There. That guy.
- George? George!

32:34.825 --> 32:38.322
- Hey, George, over here!
- Me?

32:38.324 --> 32:40.284
- Yeah.
- All right, don't move.

32:42.695 --> 32:45.362
<i>George, you're hitting on my girlfriend?</i>

32:45.364 --> 32:48.398
Yeah, absolutely. She's
really awesome, David.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.667
Yeah, she is, isn't she?

32:50.669 --> 32:54.371
Hey, look, George, please
don't do it anymore, okay?

32:54.373 --> 32:57.341
- I'll try.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

33:00.079 --> 33:04.314
Look, so, my friends don't sit
around discussing Susan Sontag.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.551
Face it, David... your friends
couldn't discuss Dr. Seuss.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.186
They're normal people, Carrie.

33:09.188 --> 33:12.522
Is it normal for George
to proposition me?

33:12.524 --> 33:15.776
- George propositions everyone.
<i>- Terrific.</i>

33:15.777 --> 33:19.062
And what about Eli railroading
me into that degrading beach game?

33:21.133 --> 33:25.769
David, if it's pop psychology you
want... "I'm okay, you're okay"...

33:25.771 --> 33:27.537
Your friends are dickheads.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.692
Excuse me.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.796
Charles, have you seen, uh, Carrie?

33:52.798 --> 33:55.665
I believe Lizbeth is showing
the new China pattern.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.201
Come on, come on, join
us. We're playing charades.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.770
- Charades.
- Charades.

33:59.772 --> 34:02.639
Oh, I just love charades.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.374
That's right, we're playing charades.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.676
Come on, everybody,
charades. Buffy, Jody, Sissy.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.146
Brian, Keith, you play, too.

34:09.148 --> 34:12.215
Okay. I go first.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.819
- You always go first.
- Chipper's host. He's got dibs.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.755
All right.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.292
It's a movie.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.659
<i>Fatal Attraction.</i>

34:27.099 --> 34:28.130
Lucky guess.

34:28.132 --> 34:32.469
Okay. I get to go again.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.139
All right.

34:37.609 --> 34:41.277
- A book.
<i>- Bonfire of the Vanities.</i>

34:47.853 --> 34:50.786
Perhaps we should play some other game.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.592
<i>- I meant to tell you.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

34:59.865 --> 35:02.566
Hi. I'm, uh...

35:03.802 --> 35:05.702
Hey.

35:05.703 --> 35:07.603
Welcome to <i>Thirtysomething.</i>
Can I get you some brie?

35:07.606 --> 35:09.639
Uhh... you got any bean dip?

35:09.641 --> 35:12.409
Thank God. So, what are you doing here?

35:12.411 --> 35:14.111
Zoe said it was cool.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.879
She's not here. She knew better.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.849
Bitch! I've been had.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.350
Oh!

35:23.755 --> 35:26.156
Of course, the view is awfully nice.

35:26.158 --> 35:29.826
Interesting food,
stocked bar. I'm staying.

35:31.463 --> 35:35.298
Carrie, darling. So
good to see you. Kisses.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.807
That ice looks cold. Is it?

35:43.809 --> 35:46.643
Eli, this is my... this is Charles.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.278
Charles, my friend Eli.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.247
Honest to God pleasure
to meet you, Chas.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.815
May I call you Chas?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.817
- Actually, I prefer "Chipper."
- "Chipper" it is.

35:53.819 --> 35:57.187
Help yourself to a
drink. Pictionary later.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.859
Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.628
Let me freshen that for you.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.796
- What is that?
- A vodka and bourbon?

36:08.267 --> 36:10.901
No, I'm a doctor. Now, listen.

36:10.903 --> 36:13.336
He's pawing my friends.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.405
I think she wants to be pawed.

36:15.407 --> 36:19.342
No, she's just getting over a
divorce. She's very vulnerable.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.747
- And I don't think that Eli...
- Eli is what... not good enough?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.949
Y-you don't think my
friends are good enough?

36:25.951 --> 36:27.918
Is that what you're trying
to say? Huh, huh, huh?

36:27.920 --> 36:29.886
...is aware that his fly is open.

36:30.923 --> 36:36.793
- Oh. Eli!
- Yeah.

36:36.795 --> 36:40.897
- Psst!
- Ah.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.700
I tried.

36:43.702 --> 36:47.837
Well, what about your friend Chipper?
<i>He was following me from room to room.</i>

36:47.839 --> 36:51.508
"Excuse me, David, but what
exactly kind of Jew are you?

36:51.510 --> 36:54.844
Are you an assimilated Jew
or are you a committed Jew?"

36:54.846 --> 36:57.480
Chipper's minor was
Comparative Religion.

36:57.482 --> 37:02.619
At least he didn't rip off your bathing
suit, and spray ice water on you.

37:02.621 --> 37:06.856
Eli is absolutely right. You
just have no sense of humor.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.827
And yet their relationship survived.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.564
I mean, I've heard that love is blind,
but I guess it's also deaf, dumb,

37:14.566 --> 37:18.802
and undauntingly tolerant of all
prejudices, personal or external.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.804
There just might be something to it.

37:20.806 --> 37:22.505
I'm not sure.

37:22.507 --> 37:23.940
Gather 'round, children. Gather 'round.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.343
Yo, yo, yo, quiet now.
No flashing. No flashing.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.978
I'll send you people home. I'll do it.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.513
Construction of the Statehouse

37:30.515 --> 37:34.284
was completed under
budget and on time in 1782.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.526
Guess they didn't have
a Union then. Ha ha ha.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.957
Anyways, if you notice the
beautiful rococo tile...

37:40.959 --> 37:43.293
Isn't is beautiful?
Can you say "rococo"?

37:43.295 --> 37:44.461
- Rococo.
- Rococo.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.795
Very good. Very good.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.831
So, this is where it all happens...

37:47.833 --> 37:50.934
Discussion, or discourse,
between the governor...

37:50.936 --> 37:53.803
<i>Can the governor park
his car anywhere he wants?</i>

37:53.805 --> 37:55.772
What happens in there?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.507
I'll check.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.999
Whoo!

38:06.000 --> 38:08.451
That's what we like to
call a gubernatorial aide

38:08.453 --> 38:11.788
and her gentleman friend,
and they are, uh...

38:11.790 --> 38:13.456
Photocopying.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.796
Are they facilitating state government?

38:19.798 --> 38:23.300
W-well, what's good for the
people is good for the state.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.535
Alexander Hamilton said that.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.437
Actually, this is my lunch hour.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.838
<i>And you spend it with him?</i>

38:28.840 --> 38:30.040
Hey.

38:30.042 --> 38:33.643
I'm... in love with this woman.

38:33.645 --> 38:38.048
And she's in love with me. Right?

38:38.050 --> 38:39.950
Yes, I am.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.851
<i>But aren't you afraid of being caught?</i>

38:41.853 --> 38:44.354
Why not save it for later... at home?

38:44.356 --> 38:46.556
Well, see, we work different hours,

38:46.558 --> 38:49.359
and h-her apartment's
really very far away, so...

38:49.361 --> 38:52.662
- Wait... you two don't live together?
- They don't have to.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.497
Puh-lease, Bobby.

38:54.499 --> 38:58.335
If you and I were sharing conjugal
relations on a laser copier...

38:58.337 --> 39:02.189
- Fat chance!
- We'd be living together,

39:02.190 --> 39:05.310
especially if I kept clothes and
stuff and shampoo at your place.

39:05.977 --> 39:09.612
- You do keep shampoo there?
- And conditioner.

39:09.614 --> 39:12.916
Look, you either move in or move on.

39:12.918 --> 39:16.052
Face it, dude. The
writing's on the wall.

39:16.888 --> 39:21.591
You know, they call it
"living in sin" for a reason.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.927
Whatever. They did
it. She moved in, yeah.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.930
"Stop by our apartment,"
David says the other day to me.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.732
"Our apartment?" Excuse me?

39:28.734 --> 39:33.136
She moves into his apartment,
and suddenly it's <i>"our</i> apartment."

39:33.138 --> 39:34.771
I don't know.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.940
Maybe I'm taking this
too hard. I don't know.

39:36.942 --> 39:41.578
W-w-what... I should bring them a
housewarming gift for their apartment?

39:41.580 --> 39:43.113
You tell me. I don't know.

39:43.115 --> 39:46.883
What's the perfect
housewarming gift for <i>them?</i>

39:46.885 --> 39:48.852
Brought you a little housewarming gift.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.120
Oh, Eli.

39:50.122 --> 39:51.988
You didn't have to.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.090
They'll come in handy.
Don't kid yourself.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.725
Where's Carrie?

39:55.727 --> 39:57.827
Um, she's out getting some more plants.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.663
More plants? Well, that's good.

40:00.665 --> 40:03.733
It's kind of phase one of
the master plan, isn't it?

40:03.735 --> 40:06.870
Plants need a lot of watering, a
lot of feeding, a lot of attention.

40:06.872 --> 40:10.440
<i>It softens you up a
little bit for phase two...</i>

40:10.442 --> 40:11.841
Babies.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.544
You're getting a little paranoid.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.012
Paranoid. Who said I'm paranoid?

40:16.014 --> 40:18.548
If I told you once, I
told you a million times...

40:18.550 --> 40:21.451
If you let a babe
infiltrate the home base,

40:21.453 --> 40:25.622
eventually she'll eradicate
every trace of the essential you.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.958
- Oh, what's this?
- What's what?

40:28.960 --> 40:31.127
This... colors and bad frame.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.763
Oh, I don't know. Carrie likes it.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.205
- Carrie likes it?
- Yeah, yeah, I like it, too.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.752
Aah.

40:38.753 --> 40:40.637
<i>You think Carrie's different, don't you?</i>

40:40.639 --> 40:43.873
Yes. Yes. You don't think
she's gonna make demands...

40:43.875 --> 40:47.911
...move you to the suburbs and load
you down with babies and barbecue.

40:47.913 --> 40:50.146
Y-you know something?
I think Carrie's right.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.848
You're a little afraid of women.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

40:53.585 --> 40:54.884
You talk to Carrie about me?

40:54.886 --> 40:57.187
Eli, we live together.
Of course I talk to her.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.922
I talk to her about everything.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.791
- W-what'd you tell her?
- Nothing.

41:01.793 --> 41:06.229
You know, it's just... For the first time,
I'm looking at things from another side.

41:07.833 --> 41:11.134
There is no other side.
There's them and there's us.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.936
Exactly. You're right.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.572
And sometimes we're a little disgusting.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.574
Okay? So, let's drop it.

41:17.576 --> 41:18.975
Yes, we're disgusting!

41:18.977 --> 41:21.811
We're men. We're idiots. It's the law.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.948
Eli, remember at college
your definition of a lesbian?

41:24.950 --> 41:26.616
Any girl who wouldn't put out.

41:26.618 --> 41:27.851
<i>Right. Exactly.</i>

41:27.853 --> 41:30.220
Well, you know, I no longer agree.

41:30.222 --> 41:32.622
All right, all right.
Do me a favor, okay?

41:32.624 --> 41:34.824
In a couple of months
when you get some time,

41:34.826 --> 41:36.893
fax me your balls,
'cause you don't need 'em.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.162
You ever have one of those
dreams where you're in the water,

41:39.164 --> 41:40.830
you're trying to save
someone from drowning,

41:40.832 --> 41:42.198
and you can't quite reach him?

41:42.200 --> 41:43.733
You're about a fingertip away,

41:43.735 --> 41:46.769
but the current keeps pulling him
further and further out to sea,

41:46.771 --> 41:49.772
and there's nothing
you can do but watch.

41:49.774 --> 41:52.108
How do I save him from slipping away?

41:52.110 --> 41:55.078
How do I bring him back to shore?

41:57.516 --> 41:58.882
<i>Hi, this is David.</i>

41:58.884 --> 42:00.784
<i>Carrie and I aren't here right now,</i>

42:00.785 --> 42:02.685
<i>But you can leave a message,</i>

42:02.687 --> 42:03.853
<i>and we'll get back to you later.</i>

42:03.855 --> 42:04.821
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

42:04.823 --> 42:07.690
Hi, Care. Hello, David.

42:07.692 --> 42:11.827
Three weeks now, and my period is
already in sync with Oprah Winfrey.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.930
Just thought you'd like to know.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.533
<i>David, sweetheart, this is your mother.</i>

42:17.536 --> 42:18.902
Oh! Ugh.

42:18.904 --> 42:20.870
<i>I have two questions...</i>

42:20.872 --> 42:23.873
<i>Number one, why don't you call?</i>

42:23.875 --> 42:27.844
<i>And number two, is
Carrie a boy or a girl?</i>

42:27.846 --> 42:30.113
Shit! I knew I forgot to call someone!

42:36.721 --> 42:40.089
I'm telling you,
everything's gonna be fine.

42:43.261 --> 42:44.727
<i>Oh!</i>

42:44.729 --> 42:48.097
There's a Cohen Brothers Shoes.
Yeah, of course, on Beacon.

42:48.099 --> 42:51.935
No, no, no, further east,
next to the Indian restaurant.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.736
You got it. Okay, Bobby.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.972
Well, it was nice
talking to you, too, hon.

42:55.974 --> 42:58.875
Good luck. Yeah. Bye-bye.

43:00.612 --> 43:03.980
Wrong number, hm.

43:03.982 --> 43:09.085
Don't worry. Brisket
is coming, but first...

43:09.087 --> 43:13.590
- A little soup with knaidlach.
- Oh, I've had those.

43:13.592 --> 43:14.924
Not like these.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.326
This is the tough part.

43:16.328 --> 43:19.228
See, Mrs. C makes this
killer brisket... world-class.

43:19.230 --> 43:22.999
But before you can eat any, you
gotta survive the interrogation...

43:23.001 --> 43:26.269
<i>Survive the interrogation...</i>

43:33.178 --> 43:36.913
So, Carrie, tell us a
little bit about yourself.

43:36.915 --> 43:39.849
I was... I was born and raised
here... I mean, Wellesley.

43:39.851 --> 43:42.919
<i>- Date of birth?</i>
- June 6, 1963.

43:42.921 --> 43:46.789
- Earlier, I thought you said July!
- July. I-I meant July.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.325
Aha. Do I make you nervous, Carrie?

43:49.327 --> 43:52.128
You're my guest. Eat!

43:56.901 --> 43:58.034
Oh, that's good.

43:58.036 --> 43:59.669
I mean, that was excellent!

43:59.671 --> 44:01.371
It was the best knaidlach I've ever had!

44:01.373 --> 44:03.906
Have you ever seen this man before?

44:05.777 --> 44:07.377
Uh, I-I don't think so.

44:07.379 --> 44:11.381
- You don't think so?! Think!
- Uh, no, I'm sure.

44:11.383 --> 44:15.818
And where was your father
during World War II?

44:15.820 --> 44:18.021
Um, college, uh, uh, medical school...

44:18.023 --> 44:20.323
Uh, Dartmouth University.
I went there, also.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.991
Huh.

44:24.929 --> 44:26.696
She made it! Yes!

44:26.698 --> 44:31.000
My David could have gone
to B.U... Harvard, even.

44:31.002 --> 44:35.238
He had the S.A.T.S, but he
wanted to go away from home.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.907
Go figure.

44:39.077 --> 44:41.944
Dear, my husband is a very proud man.

44:41.946 --> 44:46.315
He doesn't like to lose, so if you
could just ease up a bit on your serve.

44:46.317 --> 44:48.985
- You want me to throw the game?
<i>- Come on, come on, come on.</i>

44:48.987 --> 44:50.319
Powwow's over.

44:50.321 --> 44:53.222
No strategy's gonna beat
my little Care Bear and I.

44:57.896 --> 45:02.031
Please, dear? It's in
your own best interest.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.206
Out!

45:10.208 --> 45:14.477
- With a smile.
- By a mile.

45:15.980 --> 45:17.847
I don't know.

45:17.849 --> 45:20.049
I mean, to swallow
your pride in one gulp?

45:20.051 --> 45:22.251
David must be...

45:22.253 --> 45:23.886
...in love.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.755
I don't know.

45:26.491 --> 45:29.125
I do know you won't see
me sucking up like that,

45:29.127 --> 45:33.930
selling out to Kenneth and Giselle for a
few free drinks and convenient court time.

45:33.932 --> 45:36.733
Hey, do you think that's why
I've never been asked back?

45:44.809 --> 45:48.177
David, man-to-man, you had a
pretty fair game going there,

45:48.179 --> 45:51.047
but then you lost the
scent and screwed the pooch.

45:51.049 --> 45:55.885
Killer instinct wins matches.
K.I... close the deal.

45:55.887 --> 45:58.888
- You read Trump?
- I'm waiting for the movie.

45:58.890 --> 46:00.423
Consistency. Follow-through.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.325
Like I tell my lovely wife, Giselle,

46:02.327 --> 46:06.529
tennis, proctology... It's
all in the follow-through.

46:06.531 --> 46:09.932
Well, not... not many people
enjoy your consistency, sir.

46:09.934 --> 46:13.836
Hell, you can smoke a pipe and
play tennis at the same time.

46:13.838 --> 46:16.973
Grace under pressure. I
learned that during the war.

46:16.975 --> 46:19.008
- Uh, Korea?
- No, no, no, no.

46:19.010 --> 46:22.011
Carter administration...
Four years of economic hell.

46:22.013 --> 46:23.980
Crown. Crown.

46:23.982 --> 46:26.449
Should I know that name?
What's the old man do?

46:26.451 --> 46:29.919
- Oh, eat... sleep... complain.
- What?

46:29.921 --> 46:31.888
I'll tell you what
the old man doesn't do.

46:31.890 --> 46:33.389
He doesn't collect animal heads,

46:33.391 --> 46:35.792
he doesn't say things
like "screw the pooch,"

46:35.794 --> 46:37.894
and he doesn't call
Ronald Reagan "the Gipper."

46:37.896 --> 46:41.864
He calls him "that bad actor
from the chimp movies." Oy!

46:41.866 --> 46:44.967
- You like guns, David?
- Well, to tell you the truth, sir, I...

46:44.969 --> 46:47.069
This is a beauty... 12
Gauge over-and-under.

46:47.071 --> 46:49.238
Here, take ahold of it.
Go on, take it. Take it!

46:49.240 --> 46:53.176
Uh. It's not loaded or anything, is it?

46:53.178 --> 46:54.577
Oh, let's see.

46:56.414 --> 46:58.281
Ah. No, it isn't.

47:03.254 --> 47:06.022
Now it is. Here, put
this on your shoulder.

47:06.024 --> 47:07.890
There. Now grab ahold
of the stock there.

47:07.892 --> 47:09.992
And put this hand up
there. There you go.

47:09.994 --> 47:13.462
Now, lean into it. Lean into it.

47:15.066 --> 47:17.133
- How's that feel, son?
- It feels good, sir.

47:17.135 --> 47:19.202
It feels... you know, it
makes you feel like a man.

47:20.305 --> 47:21.571
Aaah!

47:24.008 --> 47:25.048
Lunch.

47:29.614 --> 47:31.414
<i>If you really want to know,</i>

47:31.416 --> 47:34.550
the real expert on the subject
was a girl that Eli knew.

47:34.552 --> 47:37.353
- Yeah? Shock me.
- Yeah.

47:37.355 --> 47:40.489
She's a nurse... nutritionist.

47:40.491 --> 47:45.428
She said that guys are, like,
you know... pure protein.

47:48.967 --> 47:52.068
Of course, that's it... protein.

47:52.070 --> 47:55.938
And... and... and you guys are
just the surgeon generals of love,

47:55.940 --> 47:59.108
just sharing this with
us for our own well-being.

47:59.110 --> 48:00.476
Hmm? Hmm?

48:00.478 --> 48:04.180
Oh, come on, David, can you honestly
say that if you were in my position,

48:04.182 --> 48:05.915
you'd feel any differently?

48:05.917 --> 48:09.352
Hon, if Eli and I were
shipwrecked on a deserted island,

48:09.354 --> 48:13.956
and the only way to survive was,
you know, the nutrients involved,

48:13.958 --> 48:18.094
then, yes, yes! We'd be going down
on each other every five minutes.

48:18.096 --> 48:21.330
I'd kill myself and then him.

48:32.911 --> 48:38.014
Hello? Eli. What's up?

48:38.016 --> 48:41.450
David, get down here
right now. I'm telling you.

48:41.452 --> 48:44.453
The planets are lined up tonight
or something, I don't know,

48:44.455 --> 48:46.989
but the chicks here tonight
are not to be missed.

48:46.991 --> 48:49.558
Now, huh? Mmm...

48:49.560 --> 48:52.295
You don't have to
touch. You can just look.

48:52.297 --> 48:53.629
<i>Yeah, Eli,</i>

48:53.631 --> 48:57.033
look, I can't come down now. It's, uh...

48:57.035 --> 48:59.235
Carrie's not feeling real well,

48:59.237 --> 49:02.505
and I just... I just
can't. It's not a good time.

49:02.507 --> 49:06.042
- What about Friday?
- Friday... uh, yeah, Friday...

49:06.044 --> 49:09.712
- Friday night, definitely.
- No, dinner with Charles and Lizbeth.

49:09.714 --> 49:11.681
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

49:11.683 --> 49:18.020
- Uh... Eli, I'll call you tomorrow?
- Oh, man, I hope she's worth it.

49:18.022 --> 49:21.590
I'm telling you, you're
missing out big-time, pal.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.125
Big-time.

49:31.602 --> 49:35.237
Mm. You know what? I'm
gonna go take a bath.

49:47.986 --> 49:49.618
Missing out.

49:52.757 --> 49:57.760
Two words that have
haunted me my entire life.

49:57.762 --> 50:02.531
Why can't I just be happy with
where I am and with what I've got?

50:04.002 --> 50:09.138
Why do I keep thinking about where
I could be and what I could get?

50:12.777 --> 50:14.276
Christ.

50:14.278 --> 50:16.078
My scoping days are over.

50:16.080 --> 50:20.082
I mean, I'm different. I'm in love.

50:21.786 --> 50:25.087
Why can't I just be
happy with what I've got?

50:27.125 --> 50:28.724
I just don't know who David is.

50:28.726 --> 50:31.627
I mean, sometimes I-I feel like
I'm living with three men...

50:31.629 --> 50:36.198
Mrs. Crown's little boy, who throws a
tantrum every time he runs out of shampoo,

50:36.200 --> 50:42.238
Eli's best buddy, the one who pulls
back when things get too intimate...

50:42.240 --> 50:45.041
And then there's my David.

50:45.043 --> 50:46.542
He's funny...

50:46.544 --> 50:49.078
he's sensitive...

50:49.080 --> 50:50.813
and considerate.

50:50.815 --> 50:53.416
He's the one I moved in with.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.386
How'd I end up with the other two?

51:00.058 --> 51:02.058
Missing out.

51:02.794 --> 51:08.297
Missing out, like Eli's really doing
something that I want to be a part of.

51:12.070 --> 51:13.736
<i>Excuse me, mister.</i>

51:13.738 --> 51:15.838
<i>We were just coming back
from our cheerleading meet.</i>

51:15.840 --> 51:18.574
We're all virgins,
but for some reason...

51:18.576 --> 51:20.676
maybe it's the planet alignment...

51:20.678 --> 51:24.814
Well, we all decided that
tonight was the night to...

51:24.816 --> 51:29.718
Well... You know...

51:29.720 --> 51:31.320
Go all the way.

51:31.322 --> 51:34.723
So, perhaps you and your
friend could help us out...

51:34.725 --> 51:38.260
You know, take us around
the city, ply us with liquor,

51:38.262 --> 51:40.529
and then take us back to your place?

51:40.531 --> 51:42.832
Well, I'd be delighted, uh...

51:42.834 --> 51:44.867
Of course, it's just
gonna have to be me.

51:44.869 --> 51:48.270
See, all my friends are
busy tonight or too tired,

51:48.272 --> 51:51.574
or home with their live-in girlfriends.

51:51.576 --> 51:53.175
Oh.

51:53.177 --> 51:55.311
Well...

51:55.313 --> 51:59.882
Do you think maybe you could
handle us all by yourself?

52:02.153 --> 52:05.387
Yes. Yes, I do.

52:07.758 --> 52:09.725
David.

52:09.727 --> 52:11.460
<i>David. Listen to me.</i>

52:11.462 --> 52:12.828
What?

52:14.332 --> 52:17.399
Sorry. Uh, what?

52:18.769 --> 52:20.769
You're bored with this
relationship, is that it?

52:20.771 --> 52:23.873
No, no, God, no.

52:23.875 --> 52:26.275
No, you see, it's just that...

52:28.513 --> 52:30.679
Listen...

52:30.681 --> 52:33.916
Pizza is my favorite food...

52:33.918 --> 52:36.318
Pepperoni and sausage, right?

52:37.755 --> 52:41.891
- W-w-what's your favorite food?
- What?

52:43.528 --> 52:45.261
Linguine and clam sauce.

52:45.263 --> 52:48.564
An excellent choice...
Linguine and clam sauce.

52:48.566 --> 52:50.900
It's great. You love it
more than anything else.

52:50.902 --> 52:53.169
You could probably have
it almost every night.

52:54.172 --> 52:57.506
Almost every night, but
you... you wouldn't want to.

52:57.508 --> 53:00.476
You'd want to try something
new, something different.

53:00.478 --> 53:01.810
You know what?

53:01.812 --> 53:04.780
Your little analogy's
starting to piss me off.

53:04.782 --> 53:08.250
Okay. Okay. Let's... let's forget it.

53:08.252 --> 53:09.818
Good.

53:14.825 --> 53:16.825
Let's just...

53:20.264 --> 53:22.598
...go to sleep.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.405
<i>Ow!</i>

53:39.884 --> 53:43.819
- Where were you?
- I was out.

53:45.756 --> 53:47.790
With Eli.

53:47.792 --> 53:51.660
- You could have called.
- Am I on a leash?

53:52.797 --> 53:54.964
Can't I have a good time without you?

53:54.966 --> 53:57.206
Can't you have a good time with me?

53:57.835 --> 53:59.802
Would it be so bad
to... to invite me along?

53:59.804 --> 54:02.404
You know, you used to think
I was pretty good company.

54:02.406 --> 54:05.274
Oh, hon, you know, when...
when Eli and I go out,

54:05.276 --> 54:07.576
you know, it's a... It's a guy thing.

54:07.578 --> 54:10.312
Eli... David and Eli.

54:10.314 --> 54:12.881
David, you're not married to Eli.

54:12.883 --> 54:15.951
Well, I'm not married to you, either.

54:24.929 --> 54:26.695
<i>David, wait.</i>

54:27.965 --> 54:29.531
What's wrong?

54:29.533 --> 54:31.533
A phone call costs 20 cents.

54:31.535 --> 54:34.637
Hello, mommy, can I stay out and play?

54:34.639 --> 54:36.339
Oh, grow up!

54:36.340 --> 54:38.040
All right, you fellas, give
me a little help here, please.

54:38.042 --> 54:39.402
Can I have a show of hands...

54:39.427 --> 54:42.778
All of you who agree with me that a
relationship is a fine place to sleep,

54:42.780 --> 54:44.747
but you wouldn't want to live there.

54:44.749 --> 54:47.750
Ah! See? Clear majority.

54:47.752 --> 54:50.086
Four guys?

54:50.087 --> 54:52.421
What do you want from me?
They're surrounded by the enemy.

54:58.629 --> 54:59.962
What?

55:01.666 --> 55:04.767
- W-we're not talking.
- We're eating.

55:04.769 --> 55:07.603
We used to talk when we ate.

55:10.875 --> 55:12.941
What do you want to talk about?

55:13.944 --> 55:16.745
I don't know. Anything.

55:21.085 --> 55:26.955
- Can we just enjoy our dinner?
- Fine. Yeah.

55:31.862 --> 55:35.431
I can't enjoy my dinner.

55:35.433 --> 55:41.470
Something's happened. I-I just... I
don't feel connected to you anymore.

55:41.472 --> 55:43.339
Do you feel connected to me?

55:43.341 --> 55:45.741
Oh, please don't give
me that look, okay?

55:45.743 --> 55:48.077
And please don't say,
"Oh, Jesus, Carrie."

55:48.079 --> 55:49.978
Okay.

55:51.015 --> 55:53.849
What do you want from me?

55:57.922 --> 56:00.923
We're in trouble, and I just
want to talk to you about it.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.660
Why do you want to talk about it?

56:04.662 --> 56:06.061
When you hit a rough spot,

56:06.063 --> 56:09.565
sometimes the best thing to
do is just ride through it.

56:10.901 --> 56:12.901
Sometimes talking makes it worse.

56:12.903 --> 56:15.904
- Let it go.
- I can't let it go.

56:15.906 --> 56:18.073
We have to deal with this now.

56:18.075 --> 56:20.442
There's nothing to deal with.

56:20.444 --> 56:21.910
You know, Eli's right.

56:21.912 --> 56:24.847
Sometimes you just
over-analyze everything.

56:24.849 --> 56:26.949
What, you and Eli sit
around talking about me?

56:26.951 --> 56:28.917
What do you... what do
you say to Eli about me?

56:30.388 --> 56:32.788
Eli's my friend. We talk about things.

56:32.790 --> 56:34.890
Look, can... can... Can we not do this?

56:34.892 --> 56:37.926
Let... let's stop this
before it turns into a fight.

56:37.928 --> 56:39.428
It is a fight.

56:41.832 --> 56:43.065
<i>Look at me, David.</i>

56:43.067 --> 56:46.702
Wouldn't you rather someone
else be sitting here right now?

56:46.704 --> 56:48.871
No, I wouldn't.

56:48.873 --> 56:51.573
Be honest... wouldn't you
be having a better time...

56:51.575 --> 56:53.876
...if someone else was here and not me?

56:54.879 --> 57:00.416
- No. No one else.
- I don't believe you.

57:01.485 --> 57:02.751
Yeah, okay, all right.

57:02.753 --> 57:05.421
I-I-I can imagine another
woman here with me.

57:05.423 --> 57:07.139
You know what?

57:07.140 --> 57:08.856
And you're right... I'm
having a better time.

57:08.859 --> 57:10.409
Want to know why?

57:10.410 --> 57:11.960
<i>Because she doesn't tell
me what I'm thinking.</i>

57:11.962 --> 57:13.662
<i>And lead me around on a leash,</i>

57:13.664 --> 57:15.664
<i>and she doesn't hang
Hockneys on my wall.</i>

57:15.666 --> 57:19.668
And she doesn't drive me crazy
with bullshit while I'm eating!

57:21.572 --> 57:26.208
Carrie! <i>Let me in!</i>

57:41.459 --> 57:45.494
<i>Wilma!!</i>

57:45.496 --> 57:48.163
Aw! Hate to see that happen.

57:50.067 --> 57:53.769
I'll go make up the couch.

57:53.771 --> 57:57.906
So, she locked you out
of your own apartment.

57:57.908 --> 57:58.941
<i>Our</i> apartment.

57:58.943 --> 58:00.142
Mm-hmm.

58:00.144 --> 58:02.644
Well...

58:02.646 --> 58:06.482
I say let her stay there.

58:06.484 --> 58:08.917
Let her sit in the
apartment with her plants,

58:08.919 --> 58:11.520
and her rolled-up socks
and her Hockster paintings.

58:11.522 --> 58:14.122
Hockney, Eli...

58:14.124 --> 58:17.926
Whatever it is, it's
hers. She can have it.

58:17.928 --> 58:23.966
- I've got the old David back, don't I?
- Yeah. Yeah.

58:23.968 --> 58:27.002
Y-you do remember the
old David, don't you?

58:27.004 --> 58:29.204
Come on, quick... the three F's.

58:29.206 --> 58:31.073
F... what are they?

58:31.075 --> 58:32.708
F... film.

58:32.710 --> 58:34.910
- Yeah.
- F... food.

58:34.912 --> 58:37.813
Yes! Film, food, fuck. Yes!

58:37.815 --> 58:40.055
Welcome back, David.

58:41.852 --> 58:46.288
So, why did we break up?
Why does anybody break up?

58:46.290 --> 58:48.857
Her friends don't like your friends.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.592
Her mother doesn't like you.

58:50.594 --> 58:53.896
She's a prude. You're
an inconsiderate slob.

58:53.898 --> 58:56.064
She forgets to cap the toothpaste.

58:56.066 --> 58:58.901
You like to sleep with the window open.

58:58.903 --> 59:01.870
Is that what it's all about?

59:01.872 --> 59:04.907
Or is being with somebody like...

59:04.909 --> 59:06.608
...getting too close to the sun?

59:06.610 --> 59:10.612
Y-y-you gotta jump back or you're
gonna get burned or go blind.

59:14.184 --> 59:17.819
<i>Hi, you've reached the
apartment of Carrie and Mr. Shit.</i>

59:17.821 --> 59:21.690
<i>We're not here right now, and
if he were, I wouldn't be. Bye.</i>

59:28.599 --> 59:31.233
...earn 1 1/2 times our income
for the same fucking job,

59:31.235 --> 59:33.035
nut-scratching,
beer-belching,

59:33.037 --> 59:34.970
"Was it good for you?"
Like he really cares,

59:34.972 --> 59:36.905
belligerent, "Hey, what's on cable?"

59:36.907 --> 59:39.974
Only own three pairs of shoes and pay
half of what you do for formal wear,

59:39.977 --> 59:43.278
and then can wear it again,
sports-obsessed, genetically inferior,

59:43.280 --> 59:45.781
orally fixated,
perpetually adolescent...

59:45.783 --> 59:48.016
Left, left, left, right, left.

59:48.018 --> 59:50.152
Left.

59:50.153 --> 59:52.287
I think my friend David
needs a refresher course.

59:52.289 --> 59:53.956
Back to basics.

59:53.958 --> 59:55.958
Lights!

59:58.829 --> 01:00:02.030
- You really think this is necessary?
- It's very dark in a bar.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:04.166
You're not Spider-Man, okay?

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:07.069
Being able to identify
a woman by silhouette...

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:10.072
...proves to be both
necessary and cost-effective.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.441
<i>Look, David,</i>

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.809
no one can afford to buy a drink
for every ugly woman in a bar.

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:17.079
Not you, not me, not the
brothers Shearson Lehman.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:20.649
- Eli, come on.
- Okay. You're gonna like this, huh?

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:22.985
This'll be good for you.

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:26.355
- Babe or troll?
- Babe.

01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:27.656
Eh...

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:30.626
Yes. Very nice. Nicely done.

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:31.927
And next.

01:00:31.929 --> 01:00:33.295
Babe...

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.963
Or troll?

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:39.668
- Eli, I... can't really...
- Yes, you can.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:42.190
<i>Think. Come on. You've got time.</i>

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.306
Babe.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:48.777
<i>Yes!</i>

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:50.412
<i>Yes, Claudia.</i>

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:52.214
Mmm, Claudia.

01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:55.017
Buy a drink for Claudia?
Mnh-mnh. I don't think so.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.318
Buy a condo for Claudia.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.087
Uh, okay, Eli, this is
all very well and good,

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.857
but does intelligence
factor into this at all?

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:04.893
You want brains, fuck Margaret Thatcher.

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:06.028
Next.

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:11.166
<i>- Babe or troll?</i>
- Oh, babe, definitely.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:14.970
Oh, that's a shame.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:20.809
You've chosen Marge Simpson...

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:24.946
An animated cartoon of a
hausfrau to turn your crank.

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:26.314
You must be very pleased.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:27.916
Jessica Rabbit, I could understand.

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.886
Even myself, I've thought on
occasion, "yes," but Marge?

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:32.538
<i>I don't think so.</i>

01:01:32.539 --> 01:01:34.189
<i>We've had enough for today, though.
Let's go out and have some fun.</i>

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.223
Okay.

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:37.426
He's ready. I can feel it.

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:40.896
He's ready to re-enter
society a reformed man.

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:43.065
Sure, sure, I gotta
worry about a relapse,

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:45.767
but I got two words that
should do the trick...

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:47.402
Tracy Seymour,

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:51.873
A.K.A. "Let's 'see more' Tracy"...

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.342
A sure thing.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.221
<i>Ping-pong balls?</i>

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.457
<i>I thought you wanted King Kong's balls.</i>

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:11.059
Oh, that is a great joke!

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:14.930
<i>That's very funny.</i>

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:17.833
<i>It's funny because the
guy wanted... right?...</i>

01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:20.302
<i>to play ping-pong,
and then structurally,</i>

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.938
it's a funny joke because he
wants... let's get out of here.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.006
The guy wants ping-pong balls, right?

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:26.975
And the store owner
thinks literally that he...

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:29.978
<i>Like, if you wanted potato
salad and you asked for coleslaw,</i>

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.247
<i>so you ask for potato
salad, and the guy says,</i>

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:36.384
<i>"I have, uh... coleslaw for
you, and why not give me, uh..."</i>

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:40.088
But in this case, you asked for ping-pong
balls and you got huge gorilla balls!

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.457
<i>That's very funny.</i>

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:50.098
David.

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.875
Tracy, I can't make love to you.

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:01.877
I'm sorry. What?

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:05.013
Tracy, I can't make love to you.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.882
One more time, please.

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.316
I can't make love to you.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:11.052
Oh, I-I thought that's what he said.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:12.187
Aaaaaah!

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:15.891
- Fine.
- I'll walk you home.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.193
No. I'll be fine.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:31.973
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.275
Carrie, it's me.

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:35.076
I, uh...

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:37.579
Really need to talk to you.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:47.022
You fuckin' pussy.

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:53.895
It's like when you finally
meet the right person.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:56.498
<i>I mean, the most important
thing to me is commitment.</i>

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.934
<i>I mean, we're all afraid to trust.</i>

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.303
And I don't just mean
trust each other...

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:05.273
<i>I mean trust ourselves,
trust our feelings.</i>

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.475
And share those feelings.

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:10.445
I mean, what are you supposed
to do... read my mind?

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:14.049
No. Men and women have to
tell each other what they want.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:15.917
<i>I can tell you what I want, Carrie.</i>

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:20.555
<i>I want a relationship
based on honesty, trust,</i>

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:22.424
<i>and continual communication,</i>

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:24.359
And... oh.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.062
Oh, I gotta take that. Excuse me.

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:30.532
<i>Could I get you anything else?</i>

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.071
How's the cheesecake?

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:43.144
The only thing worse than not getting
what you want is getting what you want.

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:46.982
Oscar Wilde. He knew.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:50.986
<i>...Cubic zirconia. Nice

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:56.291

Ohh! Make up or break up!
This stalemate has got to end.

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:35.931
You know, for once, I agree with
her. I do. I don't care what happens.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:38.500
I just want my couch back.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:41.970
He's not calling her.
She's not calling him.

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:44.172
Can someone help this couple?

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:50.445
<i>Good evening. I'm Ted
Koppel, and this...</i>

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.247
<i>...is</i> Nightline.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:55.050
Tonight, "Love on the Rocks"...

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:57.319
Crown versus Davenport.

01:05:57.321 --> 01:06:03.358
<i>You'd have to be living in a vacuum the
past week not to notice the friction...</i>

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.430
<i>...between young lovers David
Crown and Carrie Davenport.</i>

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:12.567
<i>Standing by in our Boston affiliate,</i>

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:15.337
<i>the principals.</i>

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:18.406
<i>David, is there a case to be made...</i>

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:26.247
<i>that the final blowup was only
symptomatic of much deeper problems?</i>

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:30.452
<i>Deeper problems? What do you mean?</i>

01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:33.989
<i>David, I'm referring to
this "missing out" feeling,</i>

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:37.993
<i>which, as you put it, has, and I quote,</i>

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:41.229
<i>"haunted me my entire life."</i>

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:43.398
<i>Phew! Who does your research?</i>

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.235
<i>Why do you worry about what
you might be missing, David,</i>

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:50.672
<i>outside of your relationship
with miss Davenport,</i>

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:53.919
<i>instead of concentrating
on creating a deeper,</i>

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:56.611
<i>more meaningful relationship with her?</i>

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:58.747
<i>It's not that I don't love her.</i>

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:02.017
<i>I-I do. I-I love her
with all my heart.</i>

01:07:02.019 --> 01:07:04.352
<i>I-I just...</i>

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.655
<i>I don't know. Sometimes
I-I feel trapped.</i>

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:10.058
<i>But why, David? I'm
not trying to trap you.</i>

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.327
<i>Yeah, I know that, hon. I just... um...</i>

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:18.066
<i>Carrie, David is simply expressing
a general fear of commitment.</i>

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:22.470
<i>Let me see if I can give you an example.</i>

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:27.175
<i>- What's your favorite food?
- No, Ted, shh!</i>

01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:30.045
<i>Look, we're trying to
reach an accord here, okay?</i>

01:07:31.782 --> 01:07:34.482
<i>Carrie?</i>

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:39.554
<i>I will do everything
in my power to change...</i>

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:45.293
<i>...because... I-I love you...</i>

01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:47.162
<i>...and I need you.</i>

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:50.799
<i>And...</i>

01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:53.168
<i>I want to come home.</i>

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.507
<i>Ted, how do we get out of these boxes?</i>

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:24.265
Linguine and clam sauce.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:26.234
Your favorite.

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:28.269
That's very sweet of you.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.404
It is.

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:32.207
But, um...

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:37.112
...why don't we try something
just... a little different?

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.613
Mmm.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:43.785
<i>Unh!</i>

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.453
<i>Uhh...</i>

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.122
That's it... drive it.
Foul! That's a foul!

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:48.506
Where's the call?!

01:08:48.508 --> 01:08:49.890
<i>- Where's the fucking call?!
- Oh, man!</i>

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:52.527
<i>There should be... David,
do you believe this shit?</i>

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:55.130
This liver's great. What? What happened?

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.631
<i>Bird brings it in, around-the-back
pass to Lewis, right?</i>

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.902
Sweet baseline move, and then
Laimbeer and Rodman mug him.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.904
No, no, they rape him, like in prison!

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:04.506
The Pistons aren't a team.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:06.233
They're the Manson family in shorts.

01:09:06.258 --> 01:09:09.410
- Here. You liked that... the liver, right?
- It's great.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:11.546
Okay, now try the pasta
salad with peppers.

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.747
<i>- Give me a "T" here.</i>
- Do I like this?

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.783
<i>Hold on, folks.</i>

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:18.620
<i>I can't believe what I've just heard.</i>

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:20.822
- What?
<i>- "Do I like this?"</i>

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.189
<i>You all right?</i>

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:24.259
Did I hear you correctly?

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:27.629
Did you ask her if you
liked a particular food?

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:30.665
<i>- So?</i>
- So? So?!

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:34.335
That's a question that an old man
asks his wife at a salad bar.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.804
Couples who have been
married thousands of years.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:40.441
<i>Men who no longer own
their own prostate.</i>

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:44.312
Men who have no free
will ask that question.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:48.649
It's beyond pathetic. I
have a radio in my car.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:51.886
<i>- Oh, guys! Zoe, wait.</i>
- Eli, it's the fourth quarter.

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:54.789
- They're turning into the Reagans.
- Do I hate this?

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:57.292
<i>1:37 in the ballgame.</i>

01:09:58.762 --> 01:10:00.428
Carrie.

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:09.204
- Eli. Where's Carrie?
- Yes, David?

01:10:09.206 --> 01:10:11.806
Oh, well, I'd rather...

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.808
I know you think I'm pussy-whipped,
but tell me where she is.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.143
I won't.

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.477
You know where she is.
Tell me where she is.

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:17.879
I'd really rather not say.

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:19.614
Please, Eli, tell me where she is.

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:21.816
- You're not going to like it, David.
- Where is she?

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:24.219
She got tired of waiting
for you to commit.

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:26.854
Where's Carrie? Where
is she?! Where is she?!

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:29.857
She's about to marry a proctologist!

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.492
<i>- Taxi! Taxi!</i>
- Oof!

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:42.337
I know. I know.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:45.974
A dream is your subconscious
trying to get through.

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:50.712
But, you know, it's like a bad
connection to Wabash, Australia.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:53.514
You miss every other word,
and nothing makes sense.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:11:01.022
Somehow you know it's the most
important call of your life.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.726
So, what do you do?

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:08.696
I mean, if you can't be
sure? If you can only guess?

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:13.301
When it's your turn to
talk, what do you say?

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:19.941
Excuse me.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:49.063
We nailed one!

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:52.133
Hey, guys, man overboard! Man overboard!

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:54.435
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:56.804

David, from your best

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:36.944
The key to my hotel
room and to the city...

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:39.013
...are yours.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:41.449
David? Hey, David.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:43.918
Hi!

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.087
- David. David.
- Hello!

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:49.757
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:50.992
You're the best man, son.

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:53.494
You should know where
he is at all times.

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:56.864
So, uh, where is she,
Zoe? And why is she there?

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:58.533
Well, I'm not sure.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.535
But I'm sure this is the
happiest day of her life.

01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:01.869
It better be.

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:05.039
- The natives are getting restless.
- No shit. We need some entertainment.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.775
- Do you play the piano, sir?
- No!

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:11.179
But my lovely wife, Giselle, does.

01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:19.120
- Find him!
- Aah! Aah!

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:36.037
- Hi.
- Hiya.

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:51.519
How's David?

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:53.588
It was hard to tell.

01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:56.924
Zoe, you're my best friend.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:59.627
What's gonna happen
to us if I get married?

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.597
Nothing.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:06.000
What's gonna happen
to me if I get married?

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.036
What do you mean?

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:15.176
Remember what you said to me at my
party... about me losing my identity?

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.945
I know you were kidding...

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:20.248
But I don't know... I
think you might be right.

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.618
Well, I was right.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:29.857
I mean, you will lose your identity,
but only to find a new identity.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.159
And, no offense, maybe a better one.

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:34.028
As a wife?

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.163
As a wife...

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:37.932
As a mother...

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:40.001
As a grandmother.

01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:46.607
- Boy, can you imagine me as a grandmother?
- Sure!

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:52.847
Zoe, can I rely on him?

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.585
Can I rely on... on me?

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.024
Do you love him?

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:07.128
Yes.

01:16:08.298 --> 01:16:11.198
Would you rather go
back to living with me?

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:14.569
I love you, too, but...

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.873
Then let's go get married.

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:23.010
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:53.307
- Hey, you're in my seat.
- How'd you know I'd be here?

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:58.685
Come on. We've been coming
here since we were 6.

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:04.852
Oh, by the way, Kenneth is muy pissed.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:11.692
- How about Carrie?
- She, uh... didn't say.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.068
Everything is always right here.

01:17:22.405 --> 01:17:26.307
Life is perfect under the green
monster. You ever notice that?

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:32.213
I'm usually too drunk by the
sixth inning, but... yeah.

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:40.988
I don't think anything in my marriage
is ever gonna be as perfect as that.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:44.291
- Oh, it won't be.
- Thank you.

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:48.863
- I'm sorry, David, but it won't be.
<i>- Why not?</i>

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:52.299
Because marriage isn't baseball, man.

01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:55.670
<i>It isn't a game. It's very real.</i>

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:58.072
Besides, there's a lot less spitting.

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:04.311
- So why am I doing this?
- Because you want to.

01:18:04.313 --> 01:18:06.947
Because I want to... eventually.

01:18:09.052 --> 01:18:11.986
You never really liked Carrie, did you?

01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:17.124
You know, when I first met
her, I thought, "Carrie."

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:19.894
You know... Stephen King's <i>Carrie.</i>

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:24.865
<i>But I got to know her, and, uh...</i>

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:28.969
She's okay. She's all right. She's good.

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:34.108
I'm gonna marry Carrie Davenport.

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:43.784
Ah.

01:18:43.786 --> 01:18:48.456
You know, someday... not too soon,
but someday, we're gonna come out here,

01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:52.026
and you-know-who is gonna be sitting
right between us, sucking on a frosty malt.

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:53.761
Who?

01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:56.897
- Your kid, "who?"
- You think?

01:18:56.899 --> 01:19:00.735
Come on, the first thing Uncle Eli
teaches the little sperm in Reeboks...

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:03.504
...is how to sneak into the park.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:04.505
<i>I love you.</i>

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:05.940
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:08.426
<i>Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw.</i>

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:16.083
Psst.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.886
I never asked you. What
do you do for a living?

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:20.321
I'm an accountant.

01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:22.056
<i>And do you, Carrie,</i>

01:19:22.058 --> 01:19:25.526
take this man, David, to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

01:19:25.528 --> 01:19:30.965
<i>in sickness and in health
till death do you part?</i>

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.166
I do.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:33.901
<i>And do you, David,</i>

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:37.037
take this woman, Carrie, to
be your lawfully wedded wife

01:19:37.039 --> 01:19:38.939
in sickness and in health,

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.876
to love, honor, and respect
her till death do you part?

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:43.844
I do.

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:46.781
<i>Then if there is no one here</i>
who objects to this union...

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:49.316
- Then by the powers vested in me...
- And me.

01:19:49.318 --> 01:19:51.552
...and by the covenant
of Moses and Abraham...

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:53.988
By God and the state of Massachusetts.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:55.556
...by the state of Israel...

01:19:55.558 --> 01:19:58.425
We now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:00.027
You may kiss the bride.

01:20:01.063 --> 01:20:03.030
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:04.998
We're not done, huh?
That's it? This is it? What?

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:07.201
Talk to me about rules.
Talk to me about love.

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:09.170
All right, it's a 4-letter word, huh?

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:13.073
All right, when King Kong grabbed
Fay Wray, that was love, was it not?

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:14.909
Sweet love, absolutely, yeah.

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:16.944
But afterwards, boom! Dead monkey.

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:19.446
What the hell's that? Just
tell me it was worth it, okay?

01:20:19.448 --> 01:20:21.382
You're goddamn right it was worth it!

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:24.451
They knew it the minute
they met. I knew it.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:25.462
Even you knew it,

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:28.489
although that didn't stop you from
torturing them every step of the way,

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:29.990
did it, studmuffins?

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:35.062
W-what are best friends for? I
mean, I had to be sure he was sure.

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:37.364
- Really?
- Yes.

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:40.167
Well, that's very sweet.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:43.938
- I may have misjudged you.
- What are you saying?

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:47.174
Well, you want to go
to a movie sometime?

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.977
- What... you and me?
- Yeah.

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:53.280
Dutch, no strudel, no Haagen sex,

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:56.250
although I know you desperately want me.

01:20:56.252 --> 01:20:59.019
Just a movie.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:02.990
You may kiss the bride.

01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:04.892
<i>Not so fast, padre.</i>

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:07.428
The ceremonial breaking of the glass.

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:13.267
- Mazel tov! Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov!

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:15.102
<i>Mazel tov!</i>
