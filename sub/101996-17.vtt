WEBVTT

00:11.620 --> 00:13.883
AGH!

00:23.545 --> 00:25.155
ERR!

00:25.199 --> 00:26.504
I'M LOOKING
FOR A MISSING WOMAN--

00:26.548 --> 00:28.158
BRUNETTE, HIGH CHEEK BONES,

00:28.202 --> 00:30.378
LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE
YOUR COVER GIRL OVER THERE.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.857
I--I DON'T KNOW.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.685
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOSS
ROMAN SIONIS?

00:33.729 --> 00:36.340
SOMETIMES LIKES TO SIDE HUSTLE
AS BLACK MASK.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.212
I'M JUST
A SECURITY GUARD.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.565
MACHINE PISTOL.
IT'S A LITTLE RICH

00:43.608 --> 00:45.567
FOR A RENT-A-COP.

00:45.610 --> 00:49.440
AH, YEAH, BUT THE AMMO
IS STANDARD ISSUE FALSE FACE.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.360
NOW YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,

00:56.404 --> 00:58.101
OR DO WE NEED TO FIND OUT
IF YOUR BOSS TESTS

00:58.145 --> 00:59.755
HIS PRODUCTS ON ANIMALS?

00:59.798 --> 01:01.365
I AIN'T TELLING YOU
ANYTHING.

01:01.409 --> 01:04.716
AGH! AGH! OW! AGH!

01:04.760 --> 01:06.762
"REKINDLE." EWW!

01:06.805 --> 01:08.938
DOES IT HURT AS BAD
AS IT SMELLS?

01:08.981 --> 01:11.071
LET'S TRY...

01:11.114 --> 01:12.594
REMEMBER.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.989
AGH! AWW!

01:17.033 --> 01:19.905
NOW...YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT I CAN DO

01:19.949 --> 01:21.255
WITH A MASCARA WAND?

01:21.298 --> 01:23.474
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

01:23.518 --> 01:25.085
ALL I KNOW IS HE'S
GONE UNDERGROUND.

01:25.128 --> 01:27.217
-WHAT ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER?
-I DON'T KNOW.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.958
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.264
AND YOU BELIEVED HIM?

01:30.307 --> 01:31.743
WHAT DID YOU WANT ME
TO DO, GO

01:31.787 --> 01:33.397
THROUGH THE ENTIRE
PRODUCT LINE?

01:33.441 --> 01:34.964
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO
CAN SMELL ME RIGHT NOW?

01:35.007 --> 01:36.922
WE'RE GETTING NO SIGNS
OF KATE ON TRAFFIC CAMS,

01:36.966 --> 01:39.099
AND FACIAL RECOGNITION
IS NOT GETTING ANY HITS.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.665
NONE OF THE HOSPITALS
IN 20 MILES

01:40.709 --> 01:42.754
HAVE ADMITTED KATE,
CIRCE, OR ANY JANE DOE

01:42.798 --> 01:44.234
MATCHING THAT DESCRIPTION.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.583
OK. HOW LONG SINCE
SHE WANDERED OFF,

01:45.627 --> 01:46.845
10 HOURS?

01:46.889 --> 01:48.673
LONG TIME, ESPECIALLY
IN GOTHAM.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.632
SO WHAT DO WE DO,
JUST SIT AROUND
AND WAIT?

01:54.375 --> 01:56.116
-ANYTHING?
-JUST A BELLIGERENT DRUNK

01:56.159 --> 01:58.161
AT THE HOLD-UP ACTING
LIKE THEY OWN THE PLACE.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.296
HEY!

02:04.733 --> 02:08.258
COME ON! HA HA HA!

02:08.302 --> 02:10.260
OHH. WE GOT
A DEAD SOLDIER.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.613
YEAH. SO THAT DRUNK
ACTING LIKE SHE
OWNS THE PLACE?

02:15.657 --> 02:17.006
TURNS OUT SHE DOES.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.529
ANOTHER ONE? HA HA HA!

02:27.669 --> 02:29.540
ALL THAT BAT TECH,
AND THE ONE PLACE

02:29.584 --> 02:32.978
WE DIDN'T LOOK WAS
INSIDE OF A TEQUILA BOTTLE.

02:33.022 --> 02:36.286
WATER BY THE NIGHTSTAND.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.201
TRASHCAN BY THE BED.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.334
HEAD TILTED
TO THE SIDE.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.383
MARY.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.864
YOU REMEMBER.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.780
HOW DO WE KNOW
EACH OTHER AGAIN?

02:55.044 --> 02:59.570
OK. BABY STEPS.

02:59.614 --> 03:02.312
♪ WISHING WELL HAS RUN DRY

03:02.356 --> 03:05.228
♪ WHEN I SEE YOU,
I SEE AN ANGEL... ♪

03:05.272 --> 03:07.317
HOW'S SHE DOING?
SLEEPING.

03:07.361 --> 03:08.666
FOR NOW ANYWAY,

03:08.710 --> 03:11.582
BUT WE GOT HER BACK,
SO YAY!

03:11.626 --> 03:13.105
DEFINITE YAY.

03:13.149 --> 03:16.587
GUYS, SHE WENT
FROM ATTACKING MARY

03:16.631 --> 03:18.328
TO DITCHING SOPHIE
TO TREATING HALF

03:18.372 --> 03:20.939
THE LESBIANS IN GOTHAM
TO AN OPEN BAR.

03:20.983 --> 03:24.552
IS ANYONE ELSE WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT SHE'S GONNA DO
WHEN SHE WAKES UP?

03:24.595 --> 03:27.032
WELL, IF I FOUND OUT
MY MEMORY HAD BEEN WIPED

03:27.076 --> 03:29.905
AND THEN REPROGRAMMED
INTO A DEAD SUPERMODEL,

03:29.948 --> 03:32.212
I'D GO ON A 12-HOUR
BAR CRAWL, TOO.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.735
I MEAN,
IF WE'RE FREAKED,

03:33.778 --> 03:35.519
IMAGINE WHAT IT
MUST BE LIKE FOR HER.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.913
SHE NEEDS TIME.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.349
AND I HATE
TO ADMIT IT,

03:39.393 --> 03:42.091
BUT MAYBE MY DAD WAS RIGHT.

03:42.134 --> 03:46.269
WHAT KATE NEEDS
IS HER SISTER.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.793
THE OTHER ONE.

03:51.318 --> 03:54.451
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.236
STAY WITH ME.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.976
OH, MY GOD.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.634
FIX HIM.

04:03.678 --> 04:07.638
-ALICE, HE'S GONE.
-NO, HE'S NOT.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.423
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

04:13.514 --> 04:17.387
SAVE HIS LIFE,
OR YOURS IS OVER!

04:17.431 --> 04:19.781
THAT WON'T BRING
OCEAN BACK.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.801
I KNOW HOW THIS FEELS.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.154
THAT UNBEARABLE PAIN

04:45.197 --> 04:49.201
AND NUMB EMPTINESS
ALL AT ONCE

04:49.245 --> 04:50.681
LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING
IT ALL

04:50.725 --> 04:52.988
FROM A MILLION MILES
AWAY,

04:53.031 --> 04:55.338
BUT IT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.645
I KNOW.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.517
YOU'RE THE REASON I KNOW.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.563
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE HERE...

05:04.913 --> 05:07.437
TO GLOAT?

05:07.481 --> 05:09.352
NO.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.746
I WOULDN'T WISH THIS
ON ANYONE.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.664
NOT EVEN YOU.

05:16.707 --> 05:19.928
THEN WHY
ARE YOU HERE?

05:22.060 --> 05:24.236
IT'S ABOUT KATE.

05:26.413 --> 05:31.635
UH, SH--SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S DOING GREAT.

05:31.679 --> 05:34.159
I JUST--

05:34.203 --> 05:37.119
I JUST CAME
TO THANK YOU...

05:38.860 --> 05:40.514
FOR SAVING HER.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.867
LOOK AT WHAT
IT'S COST ME.

05:50.045 --> 05:53.353
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT
WITH HIM WHEN
I HAD THE CHANCE.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.506
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:16.550 --> 06:19.117
WELL, I FIGURED
IF KATE'S GOT A FEW
GAPS IN HER MEMORY

06:19.161 --> 06:22.904
MAYBE SHE COULD USE
AN OLD-SCHOOL BACKUP
TO REBOOT FROM.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.688
I THINK IT'S MORE
THAN JUST A FEW GAPS

06:24.732 --> 06:27.212
IN HER MEMORY,
LUKE.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.475
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

06:31.129 --> 06:34.568
KATE'S NOT OK,
AND WE CAN'T RUSH THIS.

06:34.611 --> 06:37.701
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
UNIMAGINABLE TRAUMA.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.616
A DERANGED SHRINK
HYPNOTIZED HER

06:39.660 --> 06:42.097
INTO BELIEVING
A MASKED SUPERVILLAIN
WAS HER DAD,

06:42.140 --> 06:45.143
AND THE PERSON IN CHARGE
OF HER RECOVERY WAS ALICE,

06:45.187 --> 06:47.058
AND THAT'S JUST THE STUFF
WE KNOW ABOUT.

06:47.102 --> 06:50.410
WELL, I KNOW KATE.
I MEAN, SHE SURVIVED
GAS ATTACKS,

06:50.453 --> 06:54.152
A BOMB-THROWING BIRD,
A CHICK WHO THOUGHT
SHE WAS A VAMPIRE.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.067
SHE'LL SURVIVE THIS.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.329
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CONVINCE ME.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.635
I READ THOSE
JOURNALS, TOO.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.420
THEN YOU KNOW
HOW RESILIENT SHE IS.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.684
SHE HAS NEVER BACKED DOWN
FROM A FIGHT EVER.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.253
THEN WE'LL BE LUCKY
TO HAVE HER BACK.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.690
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.140
THIS YOUR WAY OF
TELLING ME WE WERE
IN A BOOK CLUB TOGETHER?

07:25.183 --> 07:28.839
SEE? YOU STILL
REMEMBER HOW TO BE
A SMARTASS.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.973
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW MUCH I MISS THAT.

07:32.016 --> 07:35.324
YEAH. YOU KEPT JOURNALS,
LIKE, METICULOUSLY.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.282
I THOUGHT IT COULD
TRIGGER SOME MEMORIES,

07:37.326 --> 07:40.111
UH, YOUR OWN VOICE,
YOUR OWN HANDWRITING.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.157
MAYBE READING
ABOUT WHO YOU WERE

07:42.200 --> 07:44.681
WILL REMIND YOU
OF WHO YOU ARE.

07:47.684 --> 07:51.471
IT--IT'S NO
BEACH READ, BUT...

07:51.514 --> 07:56.214
HEH. GOOD BECAUSE
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
NOT LIKING THE BEACH.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.868
THEN YOU'RE MAKING
PROGRESS.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.658
AND I'M STARTING TO REMEMBER
WHY WE WERE FRIENDS.

08:08.705 --> 08:13.536
UH...YEP.
JUST FRIENDS.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.364
AH, AND WHAT KIND
OF FRIEND WOULD I BE

08:15.407 --> 08:17.235
IF I DIDN'T BRING YOU
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE FUN

08:17.279 --> 08:20.412
THAN SOME DUSTY,
OLD BOOKS TO HELP
KICKSTART YOUR MEMORIES?

08:20.456 --> 08:24.416
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU
FORGOT HOW TO RIDE.

OH.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.228
I'M MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU, SWEETHEART.

09:37.272 --> 09:38.621
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

09:38.665 --> 09:41.624
GRATEFUL ACTUALLY...
TO YOU

09:41.668 --> 09:45.410
FOR SAVING ME FROM A LIFE
OF KATE KANE.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.804
CONCERT TEES
AND SINGLE EARRINGS?

09:47.848 --> 09:50.285
SHE SHOULD WEAR
A SIZE TWO WET BLANKET.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.635
IT WOULD BE MORE ON BRAND.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.245
HER BAR IS COOL, THOUGH.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.073
CAN I HAVE IT
WHEN WE'RE DONE?

09:56.117 --> 09:58.598
I'LL MAKE SURE IT'S
STILL STANDING
WHEN WE'RE FINISHED.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.077
HEH HEH.

10:00.121 --> 10:03.080
HERE. THESE SHOULD HELP
US GET STARTED.

10:03.124 --> 10:07.258
TURNS OUT KATE KANE HAD
A THING FOR PUTTING
HER FEELS ON PAPER.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.738
IF YOU CAN SUFFER
THROUGH ALL

10:08.782 --> 10:11.436
THE "DEAR DIARY,
BEING BATWOMAN IS SO HARD,"

10:11.480 --> 10:14.570
IT'S BASICALLY A USER MANUAL
FOR THE BATCAVE.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.010
WELL DONE, MY DEAR.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.446
AND ONCE I HAVE
EVERYTHING I NEED

10:21.490 --> 10:23.274
TO GIVE ME BACK
MY ISLAND,

10:23.318 --> 10:26.495
YOU HAVE MY BLESSING TO
BRING THIS ONE TO ITS KNEES.

10:40.422 --> 10:43.817
YEAH. YOU ARE COMING, TOO.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.646
HELLO?

10:48.735 --> 10:51.999
OH. HEY, RYAN.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.479
YOU WERE HOPING
I'D BE KATE.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.177
-NO. I MEAN--
-COME ON.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.876
I'M NOT THINKING
ALL OF THIS IS FOR ME.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.052
PRETTY SURE I KNOW
WHAT MEMORIES YOU'RE
TRYING TO JOG.

11:02.096 --> 11:05.882
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT ME.

11:05.926 --> 11:10.191
SO YOU, KATE,
AND BATWOMAN 1.0.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.846
THAT'S A PRETTY DRAMA-FILLED
LOVE TRIANGLE.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.891
WELL, IF THERE'S
SOME PARTS
OF OUR HISTORY

11:14.935 --> 11:17.807
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER,
IT MIGHT NOT BE
THE WORST THING.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.375
SO WHERE DO YOU TWO
GO FROM HERE?

11:20.418 --> 11:23.160
LOOKS LIKE I COULD
ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.336
IF KATE'S GONNA GET
HER LIFE BACK,

11:25.380 --> 11:27.556
SHE SHOULD HAVE
HER LOFT BACK, TOO.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.819
LOOK. IF YOU NEED
A PLACE TO CRASH,

11:29.863 --> 11:32.561
I'VE GOT A SURPRISINGLY
COMFORTABLE PULL-OUT COUCH.

11:32.604 --> 11:35.085
THANKS, BUT I GOT
A PLACE LINED UP.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.174
IT'S A LITTLE SMALL,
BUT IT'S GOT

11:37.218 --> 11:39.611
A KILLER VIEW
OF THE RIVER.

11:39.655 --> 11:42.702
GIRL, YOU KNOW JUST
BECAUSE KATE'S RETURNED

11:42.745 --> 11:46.749
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO GIVE
EVERYTHING BACK.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.839
THE SUIT'S HERS.
I WAS JUST KEEPING
IT WARM FOR HER.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.580
YOU MADE THE SUIT
YOUR OWN

11:51.623 --> 11:53.625
JUST LIKE YOU MADE
BATWOMAN YOUR OWN,

11:53.669 --> 11:55.192
AND YOU'VE PROVEN
YOURSELF

11:55.236 --> 11:57.586
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON
IN GOTHAM.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.545
THERE'S ONE PERSON
I HAVEN'T PROVEN
MYSELF TO,

12:00.589 --> 12:03.592
AND SHE'S THE ONLY
OTHER PERSON WHO KNOWS
WHAT THIS JOB TAKES.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.725
KATE WILL BE SO PROUD
OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.379
LIKE LETTING BLACK MASK
TAKE OVER THE CITY,

12:08.423 --> 12:11.600
AND NOW HE'S SUPERTEAMING
WITH SAFIYAH?

12:11.643 --> 12:14.298
YEAH. WELL, NOT
TO PILE ON,

12:14.342 --> 12:17.040
BUT YOU CAN ADD
RECRUITING EX-CROWS
TO THAT MIX.

12:17.084 --> 12:20.914
WORD ON THE STREET
IS HE'S OFFERING
TOP DOLLAR.

12:20.957 --> 12:25.919
EVERY ONE OF YOU
SIGNED UP TO PROTECT THIS CITY

12:25.962 --> 12:29.444
WITH A NOBLE PURPOSE
IN YOUR HEARTS,

12:29.487 --> 12:31.446
AND WHAT DID YOU GET IN RETURN?

12:31.489 --> 12:35.058
YOUR HANDS TIED
BY CORRUPT POLITICIANS

12:35.102 --> 12:38.148
WHO CARE MORE ABOUT SOME
CRIMINAL'S RIGHTS

12:38.192 --> 12:40.281
THAN WHAT IS RIGHT,

12:40.324 --> 12:43.763
A SYSTEM MORE CONCERNED
WITH THE RED TAPE

12:43.806 --> 12:48.289
THAN THE RED BLOOD RUNNING
THROUGH OUR STREETS.

12:48.332 --> 12:53.337
THE PEOPLE YOU'RE THERE
TO DEFEND WOULD RATHER DEFUND.

12:53.381 --> 12:56.340
WELL, I'M HERE
TO PICK UP THE TAB.

13:00.518 --> 13:03.086
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE TOOLS YOU NEED

13:03.130 --> 13:07.090
AND THE FREE REIN TO USE THEM,

13:07.134 --> 13:08.788
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

13:12.139 --> 13:15.490
WHO WANTS TO TAKE OFF
THE GLOVES...

13:18.667 --> 13:21.322
AND PUT ON THE MASK?

13:21.365 --> 13:23.019
-WHOO!
-WHOO!

13:23.063 --> 13:26.806
-YEAH!
-WHOO!

13:26.849 --> 13:28.546
HELP YOURSELVES,
GENTLEMEN.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.039
NOT A BIG FAN
OF THE SPEECH, HUH?

13:43.083 --> 13:45.476
I WORKED ON IT
ALL NIGHT.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.044
HEH. JUST CAN'T SHAKE
THE SUSPICION

13:48.088 --> 13:50.960
THAT I'M THE SAME COG
IN A DIFFERENT MACHINE.

13:51.004 --> 13:54.007
FIRST JACOB KANE'S,
NOW YOURS.

13:54.050 --> 13:58.881
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WHAT'S IN THIS FOR ME?

13:58.925 --> 14:01.231
HMM. YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE A COG, HUH?

14:01.275 --> 14:03.843
I RESPECT THAT.

14:03.886 --> 14:07.150
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU...

14:07.194 --> 14:10.937
YOU COULD BE
THE MACHINE?

14:23.210 --> 14:26.343
HELLO! STILL WORKING HERE.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.042
I KNOW,

14:29.085 --> 14:31.044
AND I KNOW WHO
YOU'RE WORKING FOR.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.267
YEAH. THOSE FALSE FACE GUYS
DOWNSTAIRS

14:37.311 --> 14:41.184
AREN'T GONNA BE
HELPING YOU.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.883
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-TO FOLLOW THE MONEY.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.060
I HEAR YOUR BOSS HAS BEEN
PUTTING EX-CROWS
ON THE PAYROLL.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.366
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
ANYTHING.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.890
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.946
ANYBODY AN EXPERT
IN QUICKBOOKS?

15:03.990 --> 15:07.210
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOT
BLACK MASK BY THE PIGGY BANK.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.603
HELLO?

15:12.607 --> 15:16.219
KATE,
AW. HANGOVER ASIDE,

15:16.263 --> 15:18.961
IT SURE FELT NICE TO BE
BACK IN MY OLD BED AGAIN

15:19.005 --> 15:20.963
AND BACK BEHIND
MY OLD DESK.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.965
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED,

15:23.009 --> 15:25.402
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SITTING RIGHT HERE.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.578
YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN'T
WAIT TO BE?

15:27.622 --> 15:32.540
OUT THERE IN THE SUIT,
PROTECTING GOTHAM AGAIN.

15:38.850 --> 15:42.550
WELL, MAMA.
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.772
YOU'D THINK BY NOW
I'D BE USED TO HAVING

15:47.816 --> 15:51.951
THE GOOD THINGS THAT HAPPEN
TO ME GETTING TAKEN AWAY.

15:51.994 --> 15:56.259
YOU...PLANT YOU...

15:56.303 --> 15:57.957
AND NOW THE BAT.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.265
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA SAY.

16:02.309 --> 16:05.181
MAYBE THE REASON I KEPT
SAYING KATE WASN'T READY

16:05.225 --> 16:09.490
IS BECAUSE I WASN'T
READY TO LEAVE.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.844
AND YOU'D ALSO TELL ME
MAKE THE MOST

16:15.887 --> 16:19.369
OF WHAT TIME YOU HAVE LEFT.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.676
MESSAGE RECEIVED, MAMA.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.855
OK, BLACK MASK.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.814
LET'S SEE WHERE YOU'VE
BEEN SPENDING

16:29.858 --> 16:32.339
ALL OF THAT SNAKEBITE MONEY

16:32.382 --> 16:34.471
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU ARE TRYING TO BUY

16:34.515 --> 16:36.038
A DAMN ARMY.

16:40.347 --> 16:41.870
HANDS WHERE I CAN
SEE THEM!

16:41.913 --> 16:43.350
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

16:43.393 --> 16:45.439
UNH! GET OFF OF ME!

16:48.572 --> 16:51.836
HEY. GET YOUR DAMN HANDS
OFF MY STUFF!

16:51.880 --> 16:54.100
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS YOUR STUFF.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.367
BUT I'M THINKING THESE
ARE DEFINITELY YOURS.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.848
LOOK LIKE SNAKEBITE
INJECTORS TO ME.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.502
YOU GUYS PLANTED
THAT.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.592
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.203
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

RYAN WILDER.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.964
OR SHOULD I CALL YOU
BATWOMAN?

19:00.008 --> 19:01.488
DEPENDS.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.881
SHOULD I CALL YOU
ROMAN SIONIS

19:03.925 --> 19:06.623
OR BLACK MASK?

19:06.667 --> 19:08.321
I HAVE TO ADMIT
I WAS SURPRISED

19:08.364 --> 19:10.149
TO FIND OUT
THE CAPED CRUSADER

19:10.192 --> 19:12.847
WAS 9-TO-5ing IT
AS A BARKEEP.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.023
AND I WAS SURPRISED
TO FIND OUT THAT GOTHAM'S

19:15.066 --> 19:18.200
LATEST SUPERVILLAIN
WAS A COSMETICS MOGUL.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.507
MARY KAY JOINING
YOUR LEGION OF DOOM?

19:20.550 --> 19:24.728
NO. I AM MERELY
A CONCERNED CITIZEN

19:24.772 --> 19:29.907
TRYING TO RESTORE JUSTICE
TO A LAWLESS CITY LIKE YOU.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.736
WE ARE NOTHING ALIKE.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.174
WE BOTH WEAR MASKS
TO AVENGE THE WRONGS

19:35.217 --> 19:37.088
PERPETRATED AGAINST US.

19:37.132 --> 19:40.091
I MUST SAY I FEEL
THAT, UH, GIVEN
THE RIGHT PUSH

19:40.135 --> 19:44.487
TOGETHER WE COULD GIVE
THIS CITY ITS SOUL BACK.

19:44.531 --> 19:48.926
YEAH, AND ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS GIVE UP MINE.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.842
WELL, NOW YOU'RE
JUST BEING SELFISH.

19:51.886 --> 19:54.845
WHY SHOULD YOU BE
THE ONLY MASKED
VIGILANTE

19:54.889 --> 19:56.673
WHO GETS TO BE
THE ARBITER OF JUSTICE?

19:56.717 --> 19:59.589
WHY SHOULDN'T EVERYONE
HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY?

19:59.633 --> 20:04.377
AFTER ALL, IT FEELS
GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

20:04.420 --> 20:06.596
IT DOES.
IT FEELS GOOD TO FIGHT

20:06.640 --> 20:08.685
FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE POWERLESS,

20:08.729 --> 20:12.211
PEOPLE TRAPPED
BY A BROKEN SYSTEM,

20:12.254 --> 20:15.083
PEOPLE LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.954
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER,

20:16.998 --> 20:19.348
HOW SHE WAS ASSAULTED,

20:19.392 --> 20:21.263
HOW THE CROWS
COVERED IT UP,

20:21.307 --> 20:23.874
MADE HER LOOK CRAZY,
THEN THREW HER IN ARKHAM,

20:23.918 --> 20:26.137
WHERE SHE SUFFERED
AND DIED.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.227
WHERE SHE WAS MURDERED.

20:32.927 --> 20:36.060
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE WE DO HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON

20:36.104 --> 20:38.062
BECAUSE...

20:38.106 --> 20:40.413
I KNOW THAT RAGE
YOU FEEL,

20:40.456 --> 20:43.242
THE NEED TO MAKE
SOMEONE PAY,

20:43.285 --> 20:45.983
BUT USING HER TO
JUSTIFY WHAT YOU'RE DOING

20:46.027 --> 20:48.247
IS DISHONORING
HER MEMORY.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.383
I DON'T PUT MUCH STOCK
IN THE WORDS

20:54.427 --> 20:56.733
OF A REPEAT
DRUG OFFENDER.

20:56.777 --> 20:58.561
NEITHER DO JUDGES
FOR THAT MATTER,

20:58.605 --> 21:00.302
NOT THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LIVE
TO SEE ONE.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.739
NO HARD FEELINGS,
WILDER,

21:02.783 --> 21:05.438
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU
GETTING IN MY WAY.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.357
GOOD-BYE, BATWOMAN.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.582
ARRESTED? FOR WHAT?

21:19.626 --> 21:21.410
POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA

21:21.454 --> 21:23.325
WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.936
-SNAKEBITE INJECTORS.
-SO SHE WAS SET UP.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.590
WE NEED TO HAVE
ALL HANDS ON DECK
FOR THIS.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.853
WHERE'S KATE RIGHT NOW?

21:29.897 --> 21:33.509
"I'M TELLING YOU THIS
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL
FIGURE IT OUT EVENTUALLY,

21:33.553 --> 21:36.207
"AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT LYING TO YOU

21:36.251 --> 21:38.340
"WAS THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE,

21:38.384 --> 21:40.168
BUT I LIED BECAUSE"...

21:42.388 --> 21:44.172
"I LOVE YOU."

21:48.698 --> 21:50.570
SO THERE'S THAT.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.356
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER
WRITING THAT

21:54.400 --> 21:56.358
OR EVEN FEEING IT,
BUT...

21:59.405 --> 22:00.971
BUT THERE'S NOT
A DAY THAT WENT BY

22:01.015 --> 22:03.365
THAT I DIDN'T READ
YOUR LETTER.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.150
I GUESS I THOUGHT
WE'D HAVE ALL
THE TIME IN THE WORLD

22:06.194 --> 22:08.152
FOR ME TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING THAT I FELT,

22:08.196 --> 22:12.896
BUT...THEN SUDDENLY
OUR TIME WAS UP,

22:12.940 --> 22:14.376
AND ALL I HAD WAS
THAT LETTER

22:14.420 --> 22:16.335
WITH ALL
OF YOUR FEELINGS

22:16.378 --> 22:19.033
AND NO TIME LEFT
TO TELL YOU MINE.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.346
AND NOW I'M THINKING
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN

22:27.389 --> 22:29.913
A LITTLE MORE TIME
BEFORE LAYING ALL
THIS ON YOU.

22:29.957 --> 22:34.178
NO.

22:34.222 --> 22:37.399
I'M JUST GLAD I DON'T
HAVE TO LIE TO YOU ANYMORE.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.542
RYAN'S BEEN ARRESTED.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.857
HEY. HOW THE HELL
DOES ROMAN KNOW RYAN
IS BATWOMAN?

23:00.901 --> 23:02.859
RYAN DIDN'T SAY.
PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE
WAS SO FOCUSED

23:02.903 --> 23:04.383
ON USING HER ONE
PHONE CALL TO WARN US

23:04.426 --> 23:05.862
HE WAS GONNA HAVE
HER KILLED.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.211
-WHERE IS SHE NOW?
-RYAN'S BEING HELD

23:07.255 --> 23:08.517
IN A SECURE
HOLDING AREA

23:08.561 --> 23:10.301
AT THE GOTHAM CITY
COURTHOUSE.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.521
CELL PHONE PINGS SHOW
50-PLUS COPS IN THAT AREA,

23:12.565 --> 23:13.914
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S
ON BLACK MASK'S PAYROLL
AND WHO ISN'T.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.394
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE
TO MAKE SURE

23:15.437 --> 23:17.047
RYAN DIES IN CUSTODY.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.223
THEN THEY MAKE UP
ANY STORY THEY WANT
AFTER THAT.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.574
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
AN EASY EXTRACTION, OK?

23:21.617 --> 23:24.272
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO TELL THE FRIENDLIES
FROM THE UNFRIENDLIES.

23:24.315 --> 23:28.102
I THINK YOUR OLD COWL'S
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE,

23:28.145 --> 23:30.931
BUT I HOPE YOU
WEREN'T KIDDING

23:30.974 --> 23:33.586
WHEN YOU SAID YOU
WANTED TO SUIT UP AGAIN.

23:41.594 --> 23:45.554
RYAN RISKED EVERYTHING
TO SAVE MY LIFE.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.643
HOW CAN I NOT DO
THE SAME?

23:56.870 --> 23:58.959
ACTUALLY, IT'S WE.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.352
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

24:01.396 --> 24:05.661
I JUST GOT YOU BACK.
I'M NOT LOSING YOU AGAIN.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.750
THAT IS SO SWEET.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.622
I'LL TAKE THE BATBIKE,
YOU TAKE THE U-HAUL.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.188
WHAT?

24:11.232 --> 24:12.363
NO!

24:20.502 --> 24:22.461
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

24:22.504 --> 24:24.811
THAT LYING TO YOU

24:24.854 --> 24:27.466
WAS THE EASIEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.053
UNBELIEVABLE.

24:50.097 --> 24:52.186
YOU WERE LESS
THAN ONE WEEK AWAY

24:52.229 --> 24:53.970
FROM YOUR PAROLE BOARD
REVIEW.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.798
I WAS GONNA RECOMMEND
YOU BE DISCHARGED

24:55.842 --> 24:58.018
FROM SUPERVISED RELEASE.

24:58.061 --> 25:01.978
YOU WERE THIS CLOSE
TO PUTTING YOUR
PAST MISTAKES BEHIND YOU,

25:02.022 --> 25:04.981
AND THEN YOU GET CAUGHT
WITH SNAKEBITE INJECTORS?

25:05.025 --> 25:06.983
THEY WERE NOT MINE.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.159
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
FAMILIAR. HMM?

25:09.203 --> 25:10.813
LAST TIME, THEY WEREN'T
YOURS EITHER,

25:10.857 --> 25:13.686
ONLY NOW YOU'VE ADDED
INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE

25:13.729 --> 25:16.645
AND VIOLATION OF YOUR PAROLE
TO THE POSSESSION CHARGE.

25:16.689 --> 25:20.562
WE'RE TALKING
REAL TIME, RYAN.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.565
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW ABSOLUTELY
SCREWED YOU ARE?

25:23.609 --> 25:28.004
YES, BUT I DON'T
THINK YOU DO.

25:28.048 --> 25:29.658
I HAVE BEEN SET UP.

25:29.702 --> 25:34.054
OH. RIGHT. REALLY?
BY WHO? THE GCPD?

25:34.097 --> 25:37.579
NO. BLACK MASK,
WHO OWNS THE GCPD,

25:37.623 --> 25:40.582
AND THEY ARE TRYING
TO KILL ME.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.019
OK. SO I'M GUESSING
THEY DIDN'T FIND
ANY SNAKEBITE

25:43.063 --> 25:45.413
BECAUSE YOU GOT HIGH
ON IT.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.592
TRUST ME.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.028
I AM NOT GOING TO
MAKE IT OUT

25:52.072 --> 25:53.639
OF THIS BUILDING
ALIVE.

25:56.729 --> 25:59.035
OK.

25:59.079 --> 26:02.691
FINE. INDULGING THIS
PARANOID FANTASY

26:02.735 --> 26:06.695
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
THAT'S WHAT I DO NOW.

26:06.739 --> 26:10.394
WHY WOULD ONE
OF GOTHAM'S WORST
CRIMINAL MASTERMINDS

26:10.438 --> 26:12.614
WANT TO TARGET YOU?

26:17.837 --> 26:19.839
BECAUSE I'M BATWOMAN.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.108
RYAN, YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE ANY OF THIS!

26:28.151 --> 26:30.980
YOU SAW THAT 6-MAN
SWAT TEAM THAT
BROUGHT ME IN HERE.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.330
YOU SAW HOW MANY GUARDS
ARE WAITING OUTSIDE.

26:33.374 --> 26:36.116
YOU SAW ALL OF THAT
FIREPOWER FOR A BAG FULL

26:36.159 --> 26:38.509
OF EMPTY
SNAKEBITE INJECTORS.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.906
NOW I NEED YOU
TO SEE ME.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.607
STAND UP.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.478
DO YOU SEE ME?

26:53.350 --> 26:55.614
HOLD ON!

26:55.657 --> 26:57.616
I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH JUDGE HAMADA.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.661
I HAVE REASON TO
BELIEVE MY PAROLEE

26:59.705 --> 27:01.620
IS BEING RAILROADED.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.497
UGH!

27:11.673 --> 27:13.762
AGH!

27:13.806 --> 27:15.546
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN THERE?

27:38.744 --> 27:40.876
-DAMN IT.
-WAIT!

27:43.052 --> 27:44.880
YOU'RE GONNA
NEED THIS.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.665
IT'LL GET YOU OUT
OF THE PARKING
GARAGE EXIT

27:46.708 --> 27:48.971
IF YOU HURRY.

27:49.015 --> 27:51.017
THANK YOU.

27:51.060 --> 27:55.586
NOT JUST FOR THIS
BUT FOR BELIEVING ME.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.719
ANYTIME...

27:57.763 --> 27:59.199
BATWOMAN.

28:04.421 --> 28:07.729
NO ROYAL GUARD
TO ACCOMPANY THE QUEEN.

28:07.773 --> 28:11.167
I'D LOVE TO MEET
TATIANA'S REPLACEMENT.

28:11.211 --> 28:13.604
I'VE KNOWN WHERE YOU ARE
AT ALL TIMES.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.694
IF I WANTED YOU DEAD,
I WOULD HAVE TASKED

28:15.737 --> 28:17.826
THE MEN WHO TRACKED
YOU HERE TO DO IT.

28:17.870 --> 28:21.351
SO YOU CAME ALONE.
WELL, THAT'S GUTSY.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.919
YOU WOULDN'T DARE KILL ME.

28:23.963 --> 28:28.010
BESIDES, THAT WOULD BE
NO FUN FOR YOU.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.404
EVEN AFTER YOU
KILLED MY OCEAN!

28:32.885 --> 28:34.843
HIS DEATH,
HOWEVER TRAGIC,

28:34.887 --> 28:36.758
WAS A NECESSARY SACRIFICE.

28:36.802 --> 28:40.893
HE WASN'T ONE OF YOUR
ISLAND HIPPIES,
YOU BITCH!

28:40.936 --> 28:42.764
YOU SAID YOU LOVED HIM
LIKE A BROTHER.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.635
AND I'VE TAKEN HIM
FROM YOU JUST THE WAY

28:44.679 --> 28:46.768
YOU TOOK THE THING
I LOVED MOST,

28:46.812 --> 28:49.553
THE DESERT ROSE.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.904
NOW WE ARE EVEN.

28:58.606 --> 29:01.870
LET THIS WAR BETWEEN US
DIE WITH OCEAN

29:01.914 --> 29:04.612
BEFORE YOU JOIN HIM.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.136
SO MUCH
FOR THE WAR ENDING

29:07.180 --> 29:09.660
BECAUSE THAT SOUNDED
AN AWFUL LOT LIKE
YOU THREATENING

29:09.704 --> 29:11.227
TO KILL ME.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.229
MY DEAR,

29:13.273 --> 29:14.796
I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.319
FROM WHAT?

29:16.363 --> 29:19.148
A YUMMY, DADDY-APPROVED
BOYFRIEND?

29:19.192 --> 29:21.324
FROM THE THING YOU
FEAR MOST--

29:21.368 --> 29:24.588
SPENDING THE REST
OF YOUR DAYS LOCKED
IN A CAGE.

29:24.632 --> 29:27.069
A STORM IS COMING
FOR GOTHAM,

29:27.113 --> 29:29.942
AND ONLY ONE PLACE
YOU CAN SEEK SHELTER.

29:35.730 --> 29:36.949
THERE SHE IS.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.517
AND WHERE'S THAT?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.606
COMING DOWN OFF OF
A HALOPERIDOL BENDER

29:42.650 --> 29:46.610
COURTESY OF THIS
LITTLE GUY.

29:46.654 --> 29:49.265
OTHER SIDE EFFECTS
YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD TO

29:49.309 --> 29:52.616
INCLUDE CONFUSION,
NAUSEA...

29:52.660 --> 29:54.096
AND HOPEFULLY NOT
VOMITING

29:54.140 --> 29:55.706
BECAUSE WE'RE STUCK
IN HERE.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.844
KATE--CIRCE--
WHATEVER THE HELL
WE CALL HER--

30:02.888 --> 30:05.368
REALLY DID A NUMBER
ON THIS THING.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.848
SHE WAS PLAYING US
THE WHOLE TIME.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.937
YEAH. WE WERE SO DESPERATE
TO HAVE HER BACK,

30:08.981 --> 30:10.112
WE FELL FOR IT.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.724
PRETTY SURE POURING
YOUR HEART OUT

30:13.768 --> 30:15.857
TO A SLEEPER AGENT
HAS THAT BEAT.

30:19.861 --> 30:23.517
BUT...SHE COULD
HAVE KILLED US,
AND SHE DIDN'T.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.650
MAYBE THERE'S STILL
SOME KATE LEFT
IN THERE.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.523
OR MAYBE JUST ENOUGH
TO GIVE THE KEYS
TO THE CASTLE.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.437
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WE'RE EXCITED
ABOUT KATE BEING BACK,

32:41.481 --> 32:42.830
BUT I REALLY COULD HAVE
USED A HELPING HAND.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.745
SO COULD WE!

32:46.312 --> 32:48.009
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

32:48.053 --> 32:49.706
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID
I KNOW KATE BETTER
THAN YOU DO?

32:49.750 --> 32:51.534
ONLY WORKS IF IT'S
REALLY KATE.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.797
IT WAS CIRCEPRETENDING THE WHOLE TIME.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.016
SO WHERE IS SHE NOW?

32:55.060 --> 32:56.539
NO IDEA.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.628
OK.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.244
OK. I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CUT THROUGH IT.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.511
WHERE THE HELL
ARE THE WEAPONS?

33:13.034 --> 33:14.427
THERE'S ONE.

33:22.696 --> 33:26.482
YOU HAVE THE COOLEST TOYS.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.571
AND HERE I WAS THINKING
I WAS THE GIRL

33:28.615 --> 33:31.139
WHO HAD EVERYTHING.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.011
I GUESS NOW I DO.

33:41.976 --> 33:45.414
RUNNING AWAY.
HOW HEROIC.

33:49.592 --> 33:54.684
COME BACK WITH ME.
COME HOME.

33:54.728 --> 33:59.689
YOU WANT ME TO COME
BACK TO CORYANA
WITH YOU?

33:59.733 --> 34:02.214
HA HA HA!

34:02.257 --> 34:05.391
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

34:05.434 --> 34:08.872
DO YOU HAVE ANY
NON-SMOKING ROOMS
AVAILABLE?

34:08.916 --> 34:10.918
NO, BECAUSE
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT I TURNED

34:10.961 --> 34:15.183
YOUR LITTLE ISLAND
INTO AN ALL-INCLUSIVE
ASHTRAY.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.272
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

34:17.316 --> 34:20.928
CORYANA WILL SOON BE
ABLOOM WITH DESERT ROSE
ONCE MORE

34:20.971 --> 34:24.758
THANKS TO A SMALL CUTTING
FROM ONE OF POISON IVY'S VINES.

34:24.801 --> 34:27.108
ITS RATHER AGGRESSIVE
GROWTH PROPERTIES

34:27.152 --> 34:30.068
WILL SOON TURN
MY ONE ROSE INTO THOUSANDS.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.548
POISON IVY, HUH?

34:32.592 --> 34:35.377
DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
THE GREEN THUMB GIRL
ON SPEED DIAL.

34:35.421 --> 34:39.120
I DON'T. I SIMPLY STRUCK
A GENTLEWOMAN'S AGREEMENT

34:39.164 --> 34:41.992
WITH A NEW FRIEND
TO PROCURE IT FOR ME.

34:42.036 --> 34:45.213
YOU SEE, SHE WAS
ALL TO EAGER TO HELP ME

34:45.257 --> 34:49.783
ONCE I HAD A SWORD DRIVEN
THROUGH THE POWERFUL MAN
WHO HAD WRONGED HER

34:49.826 --> 34:52.916
ALONG WITH THE MEN
WHO CONDEMNED HER TO ARKHAM,

34:52.960 --> 34:55.571
WHERE SHE WAS TRAMPLED.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.922
CIRCE SIONIS.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.185
OH.

35:02.056 --> 35:05.103
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
YOU'D GOTTEN YOUR
SISTER BACK, DID YOU?

35:14.503 --> 35:16.244
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO SHOOT AT,

35:16.288 --> 35:18.638
I'M GONNA HAVE TO IMPROVISE.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.180
KATE, I KNOW THAT
THERE'S STILL

35:39.224 --> 35:41.008
A SMALL PART
OF YOU IN THERE

35:41.051 --> 35:43.489
THAT DOESN'T WANT
TO KILL US!

35:43.532 --> 35:46.361
UNFORTUNATELY,
BUT THAT SMALL PART OF ME

35:46.405 --> 35:48.015
IS NOT MY TRIGGER FINGER.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.457
WOW! I'M REALLY GETTING
THE HANG OF THIS NOW.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.546
THEN AGAIN, IT IS JUST
LIKE SHOOTING

35:57.590 --> 36:00.636
AT SAD, NEEDY, PATHETIC
FISH IN A BARREL.

36:03.335 --> 36:04.858
UNH!

36:10.255 --> 36:13.475
THIS NOSE COST MORE
THAN EVERYTHING IN HERE.

36:13.519 --> 36:16.478
IT'S NOT YOUR NOSE.
OTHERWISE, I WOULD
HAVE BROKEN IT.

36:16.522 --> 36:20.003
OH. DON'T PULL
YOUR PUNCHES ON MY ACCOUNT.

RYAN, DON'T FEEL BAD.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.617
KATE WASN'T STRONG
ENOUGH TO BE ME EITHER.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.284
YOU HAVE NOTHING.

38:06.327 --> 38:10.157
NO BOYFRIEND,
NO SISTER.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.117
I'M ALL YOU HAVE LEFT
EXCEPT FOR ENEMIES.

38:14.161 --> 38:17.425
SOON, GOTHAM WILL
OFFER YOU NO SANCTUARY.

38:17.469 --> 38:20.602
BUT YOU WILL?

38:20.646 --> 38:23.779
OF COURSE, MY DEAR.

38:23.823 --> 38:27.957
WHO ELSE IS GOING TO
PROTECT YOU?

38:28.001 --> 38:31.657
WHO ELSE IS GOING
TO LOVE YOU?

38:31.700 --> 38:33.702
YOU'RE ALL ALONE.
YOU HAVE NO FAMILY

38:33.746 --> 38:36.879
OTHER THAN ME.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.359
I KNOW.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.667
OH.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.583
OH!

38:48.413 --> 38:50.850
BECAUSE YOU TOOK
THEM FROM ME.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.378
AND I'LL REMOVE
YOUR DESERT ROSE DAGGER

38:57.422 --> 39:00.816
ONCE I GET THEM BACK,

39:00.860 --> 39:02.514
AND THEN WE'LL TALK.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.000
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:11.044 --> 39:15.048
KILLING YOU--TCK, TCK--
THAT WOULD BE NO FUN.

39:16.876 --> 39:20.749
BUT MAKING YOU SUFFER...

39:20.793 --> 39:23.926
NOW THAT'S
A DIFFERENT STORY.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.415
RADIATION GAUGES,

39:34.459 --> 39:37.723
BIOHAZARD LEVEL 3?

39:37.766 --> 39:40.029
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

39:40.073 --> 39:42.684
WELL, IT WAS
WHERE BRUCE KEPT
THE WEAPONS

39:42.728 --> 39:45.600
AND OTHER BAD STUFF
HE CONFISCATED

39:45.644 --> 39:47.210
FROM ALL THE VILLAINS
HE TOOK DOWN.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.387
AND NOW CIRCE
HAS THEM.

39:54.304 --> 39:57.220
LOOK, RYAN. I'M SORRY.

39:57.264 --> 39:58.700
YOU WARNED US
NOT TO RUSH THINGS,

39:58.744 --> 40:00.876
AND WE ALL JUST WANTED
KATE BACK SO BAD

40:00.920 --> 40:02.443
WE JUST DIDN'T
QUESTION IT,

40:02.487 --> 40:04.750
BUT YOU DID.

40:04.793 --> 40:07.448
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

40:07.492 --> 40:12.148
SHE HAS WMDs,
THE BATBIKE,

40:12.192 --> 40:14.542
MY SUIT, MY WEAPONS.

40:14.586 --> 40:18.111
LOOK.
I KNOW IT'S BAD,

40:18.154 --> 40:21.070
BUT WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.464
WE ALWAYS DO.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.771
I HOPE YOU'RE
RIGHT, MARY,

40:25.814 --> 40:28.034
BECAUSE IF I'M
BEING HONEST...

40:30.123 --> 40:32.125
I'M SCARED AS HELL.

40:43.702 --> 40:46.792
JOKER'S ACID FLOWER.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.750
CLAYFACE'S MUD,

40:48.794 --> 40:51.840
KILLER CROC'S TOOTH.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.494
WHY YOU COLLECTING
ALL THIS STUFF

40:53.538 --> 40:55.453
FROM BATMAN'S ENEMIES?

40:55.496 --> 40:57.977
SO I CAN SUCCEED
WHERE THEY FAILED.

41:02.721 --> 41:04.810
SHALL WE GET STARTED?

42:04.913 --> 42:07.263
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
