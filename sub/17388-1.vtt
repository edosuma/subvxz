00:38.794 --> 00:41.137
So, how have you been feeling?

00:42.237 --> 00:44.392
Okay, I guess.

00:44.508 --> 00:47.763
Have you had any more
contractions since your last visit?

00:47.764 --> 00:50.444
A few, I think.

00:51.794 --> 00:53.796
Uh, there we go.

00:57.284 --> 01:00.148
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:04.669 --> 01:06.851
Heartbeat looks good.

01:08.304 --> 01:11.000
Just need to get a few
measurements here.

01:16.562 --> 01:20.369
Now, you did not want to know
the sex of the baby, correct?

01:20.370 --> 01:24.012
- Mm, no. I'd rather not.
- Okay.

01:24.909 --> 01:27.462
I honestly don't blame you.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.464
If I could do it over again,
I wouldn't want to know, either.

01:32.650 --> 01:36.959
We were told I was having
a girl. Ended up a boy.

01:37.405 --> 01:41.411
Had to redecorate the nursery,
return all the shower gifts.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.903
Such a pain.

01:44.878 --> 01:48.834
Guess it's kind of ironic,
though, considering what I do.

01:57.749 --> 01:59.912
Wipe up for you.

02:05.796 --> 02:07.915
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:21.394 --> 02:23.372
There you go.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.566
So, how have you been
feeling in general?

02:27.976 --> 02:31.860
Okay, I guess. I just
want to get it over with.

02:31.861 --> 02:36.773
Just about everyone says the same thing at
this point. It won't be long now, though.

02:37.717 --> 02:40.077
Okay, well, if you don't have
any more questions for me,

02:40.078 --> 02:43.735
then the doctor will be going over all the
results with you at your visit next week.

02:43.736 --> 02:46.018
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:50.744 --> 04:54.504
Can you tell me your name?
Can you open your eyes for me?

04:55.900 --> 04:58.614
Get breath sounds, too,
when you get that done.

04:58.894 --> 05:02.482
We got the one I.V. We're gonna
get another one... bilateral arm.

05:03.316 --> 05:06.466
Got a mid-20-year-old female
involved in an assault.

05:07.292 --> 05:12.084
Obvious trauma to the head,
vaginal bleeding, unresponsive.

05:12.348 --> 05:15.419
- Got one 14-gauge I.V. On...
- One, two, three.

05:15.420 --> 05:18.339
We need to get a second I.V.
Let's start some more I.V. fluids

05:18.340 --> 05:22.477
and get two units of O-neg
blood. We need to call O.B. Stat.

05:22.578 --> 05:26.230
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Bales.
Can you hear me?

05:26.866 --> 05:29.230
Are you having any pain?

05:31.301 --> 05:33.337
She's unresponsive.

05:51.613 --> 05:54.232
Give me the O.B. B.P. Stat.

05:55.630 --> 05:56.634
- Dr. Bales?
- Yes.

05:56.635 --> 05:59.090
They can't be here for at least
30 minutes. They're in surgery.

05:59.091 --> 06:01.288
The baby's heart rate is really
low. I need a blood pressure.

06:01.289 --> 06:02.889
Blood pressure's 60.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.587
We can't wait. We have
to get the baby out now.

06:27.878 --> 06:29.751
I need a scalpel.

06:48.844 --> 06:52.776
Dr. Romero. Dr. Romero, please.

07:05.248 --> 07:06.765
Come in.

07:09.699 --> 07:13.392
- Esther Woodhouse?
- Yes.

07:14.998 --> 07:19.119
My name is detective Allen. Do
you have a few minutes to talk?

07:20.370 --> 07:22.114
Okay.

07:26.594 --> 07:28.555
May I?

07:36.822 --> 07:40.111
- How are you feeling?
- Pretty sore.

07:40.641 --> 07:43.586
Not great, I guess.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.252
I'm very sorry about your baby.

07:50.859 --> 07:56.182
I know this will sound strange,
but you are actually quite lucky.

07:59.076 --> 08:01.409
And how's that?

08:02.082 --> 08:07.373
You lost a lot of blood. Most
people don't come back from that.

08:10.054 --> 08:13.035
You're right. That is
a strange thing to say.

08:13.096 --> 08:17.581
Nevertheless, that's what you
should be focusing on right now.

08:17.640 --> 08:23.095
How much worse things could have
been. It'll help with the anger.

08:25.718 --> 08:27.399
So...

08:29.066 --> 08:34.659
Do you feel up to talk about
what happened, what you remember?

08:36.938 --> 08:41.941
I... don't really
remember much of anything.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.530
I left my O.B. Appointment.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.690
And I was walking to the bus stop.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.927
And then I woke up here.

08:58.338 --> 09:02.641
Everything else is
just pieces, fragments.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.933
I couldn't tell you
what was real or not.

09:09.483 --> 09:14.815
We recovered your purse at the entrance
to the alley where you were found.

09:14.821 --> 09:19.256
We'll have you check it just to be sure,
but... It looks like all that's missing is

09:19.282 --> 09:22.535
- whatever money you would have had.
- When can I have it back?

09:23.397 --> 09:27.365
Um... soon. It's safe.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.801
I know. I just want it back.

09:31.565 --> 09:35.653
- I'd just like to have it back.
- Okay, um, I'll see what I can do.

09:38.812 --> 09:43.082
Is there anyone you can think
of, Esther, anyone at all,

09:43.083 --> 09:46.386
that may have held
a grudge against you?

09:46.486 --> 09:52.526
Can I think of anyone who
might want to kill my baby? No.

09:53.881 --> 09:55.549
What about the father?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.050
Sperm bank.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.166
Sperm...

10:06.840 --> 10:11.356
- Why a sperm bank?
- Doesn't matter now.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.648
Co-workers, acquaintances?

10:16.650 --> 10:18.113
No.

10:18.114 --> 10:22.023
Why are you asking me all this?

10:22.322 --> 10:26.906
This thing that happened to you,
Esther... this type of assault

10:26.907 --> 10:31.339
is almost always carried out by
someone who knows the victim personally.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.809
The time it took to
do this, the risk,

10:37.938 --> 10:42.120
The emotion involved to follow
through with something so...

10:42.943 --> 10:46.511
It's just not characteristic
of a random mugging.

10:47.113 --> 10:50.637
Well, I don't know who
would want to do it.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.634
What about someone on drugs or...

10:54.755 --> 10:57.538
a misogynist...

10:57.881 --> 11:02.787
or maybe just some crazy homeless
person who lived in that alley?

11:05.699 --> 11:07.244
Yeah, yeah.

11:07.245 --> 11:10.250
I mean, those...

11:10.637 --> 11:13.471
those are all
definite possibilities.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.507
Looks like you have
your next visitor.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.783
I'll get out of here, and I'll
let you two get acquainted.

11:24.785 --> 11:29.750
Just, uh... give some
thought to what I said.

11:34.160 --> 11:39.464
Call me anytime. My cellphone's
on there and everything.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.974
- Okay.
- I'll be in touch soon.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.439
So sorry, again, for your loss.

11:55.781 --> 11:59.651
Hi, Miss Woodhouse. I'm Mary Wilkens. I'm one
of the social workers here at the hospital.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.354
- Hi.
- How are you feeling?

12:02.656 --> 12:05.662
Going to get that question
a lot around here, I guess.

12:05.726 --> 12:09.790
Yeah. Well, I'll try and make it quick
so we can let the next one come in.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.582
- The next one?
- The doctors, the nurses,

12:12.583 --> 12:18.249
rehab, police, social
workers, religious counsel...

12:18.927 --> 12:22.208
all day and, I'm afraid, all
night, until you leave here.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.741
There's gonna be more people come through
that door than you know what to do with.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.780
You're gonna get
sick of the attention.

12:30.650 --> 12:34.882
So, who can I call to talk to about
helping you transition back into life?

12:35.989 --> 12:39.259
Uh, there really isn't anyone.

12:39.593 --> 12:43.228
- I'm kind of on my own.
- Family, co-workers?

12:43.230 --> 12:45.764
I don't have any family.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.800
Friends? Who are you close to?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.368
My fish.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.972
Sweetie, I need
names. Give them up.

12:53.974 --> 12:58.977
I'm sorry. There really isn't
anyone... no one who would care.

12:58.979 --> 13:02.278
You're gonna need a support system,
people to help you through this.

13:02.304 --> 13:04.717
Without it, it's going to
be incredibly difficult.

13:04.718 --> 13:08.523
Well, the Chaplain's been
in and the police and you.

13:08.524 --> 13:11.099
I'm talking about
long-term support.

13:11.111 --> 13:15.094
We're here to help you with
the initial phase of recovery.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.250
Have you ever had any
formal therapy before?

13:19.821 --> 13:21.135
No.

13:26.906 --> 13:30.310
That lists therapists and counselors
as well as several support groups

13:30.311 --> 13:35.135
that specialize in victims of violent
crimes and women who have lost a child.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.050
Thank you.

13:39.052 --> 13:42.746
- I'll take a look at it.
- I hope you do.

13:43.690 --> 13:48.560
Don't fall through the cracks. Too many
people do. You have to reach out now.

13:48.562 --> 13:52.161
You remember the people who I said who are
going to come in to see you and help you?

13:52.940 --> 13:55.420
That stops once you leave here.

13:55.582 --> 13:57.176
We're here to help and support you,

13:57.177 --> 14:01.063
but the second you walk out the front
doors of the hospital, we disappear.

14:01.098 --> 14:04.609
I go onto to the next person
that needs help and then the next.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.477
You understand?

14:08.215 --> 14:10.094
Okay.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.202
Sorry, buddy.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.944
One new message.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.179
Hey, it's me.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.744
Just wondering if you're okay.

15:19.085 --> 15:24.272
Okay. I'll just, uh, try
you back later when I can.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.259
Message deleted.

17:23.511 --> 17:28.387
And he just kept
laughing and laughing.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.786
You know what really
gets me, though,

17:33.366 --> 17:38.256
is that he thought
this was just a-a joke.

17:41.961 --> 17:45.521
Thank you for sharing that, Audrey.

17:49.903 --> 17:54.104
So, would anyone else like to
share before we take a short break?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.800
All right then.

17:58.801 --> 18:02.570
For those of you who are new to our
group, we have pastries and coffee,

18:02.571 --> 18:05.629
so please feel free
to help yourself.

18:05.630 --> 18:09.695
So, let's take about,
um, 10 minutes, okay?

18:18.997 --> 18:21.446
This your first meeting?

18:23.337 --> 18:25.970
- Yeah.
- I thought so.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.272
I'm Melanie.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.374
- Esther.
- So nice to meet you.

18:30.376 --> 18:34.112
- You kind of had that look on your face.
- What look?

18:34.114 --> 18:38.316
Oh, like you're not quite sure
what to make of this place.

18:38.318 --> 18:42.587
Well, I've just never really
done anything like this before.

18:42.589 --> 18:46.917
I get it. The first
time is always strange.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.600
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

18:54.844 --> 18:56.583
Ooh, I love the shirt.

18:57.437 --> 19:01.038
- Thanks. It wasn't expensive.
- Even better.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.163
It looks really good on you.

19:15.320 --> 19:20.091
Most of these women... they've been
through some really horrific things.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.325
Do you think coming here helps?

19:25.859 --> 19:27.398
I do.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.475
I mean, there is something about
hearing other people tell you

19:29.507 --> 19:32.430
the terrible things that
have happened to them that...

19:33.328 --> 19:36.363
kind of makes you feel better
about your own problems.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.279
It's like you're not alone.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.567
Is this how I look?

19:47.654 --> 19:49.164
Honest?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.404
Yes.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.905
Hey, but don't worry. That's
why you're here, right?

19:56.062 --> 19:58.442
How come you don't?

20:00.066 --> 20:03.167
I guess most of my
damage is on the inside.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.967
We're coming back now, so please
feel free to join the group.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.847
Great. Thank you.

20:10.010 --> 20:13.771
- Ready?
- Does everyone have to...

20:14.349 --> 20:17.181
talk about what happened to them?

20:17.183 --> 20:20.084
Oh, no, no. You don't have
to do anything. You can...

20:20.086 --> 20:25.118
Just sit. A lot of people just come,
and they listen, they don't talk.

20:25.624 --> 20:28.993
And then there's
others... don't shut up.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.512
Come on, you. Come sit with me.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.333
My husband and son.

20:37.535 --> 20:40.888
What happened to them?

20:42.475 --> 20:46.510
They were coming to pick
me up from work one night.

20:46.512 --> 20:49.955
Drunk driver ran a
light. That was it.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.814
I'm sorry.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.477
They say it gets better...

21:10.370 --> 21:12.054
but it doesn't.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.254
It never gets easy.

21:20.479 --> 21:23.990
And everyone around you...
they forget almost immediately.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.603
I think that's probably one
of the most unbearable parts.

21:30.757 --> 21:34.243
They want you to
forget, too, but...

21:41.199 --> 21:43.536
That's why I go to the groups.

21:44.057 --> 21:46.311
You can tell your story
for as long as you need to,

21:46.312 --> 21:49.490
and no one gets sick of
you being in pain and...

21:50.893 --> 21:53.278
no one gets tired of caring.

21:59.351 --> 22:02.273
I lost my baby.

22:04.816 --> 22:08.382
I was walking to the bus stop.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.486
And then...

22:14.801 --> 22:19.551
You don't need to tell
me. It's still too soon.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.497
But you know what?

22:38.923 --> 22:41.829
For whenever you're ready.

22:42.877 --> 22:45.427
Because we all need
someone to listen.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.900
Can I help you?

24:17.923 --> 24:21.492
I just... I didn't
know where else to go.

24:21.494 --> 24:25.079
Well, I'm sorry, but
you can't be back here.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.731
Do I have to leave?

24:27.733 --> 24:31.969
- What do you mean?
- Is there someplace I can just.. sit?

24:31.971 --> 24:36.640
Well, no. This is a hospital.
You can't just be here.

24:36.642 --> 24:39.744
Anywhere?

24:40.379 --> 24:44.845
There's a waiting room around the
corner. I guess you could sit there.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.484
Thank you.

24:47.987 --> 24:52.127
Okay, just... you have to
find someplace else to go.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.022
Hi, you've reached
Melanie. Leave me a message.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.292
Hi, Melanie.

26:35.294 --> 26:40.709
It's Esther... from the
other night... the meeting.

26:41.270 --> 26:47.632
I was calling to see if
you were going today and...

26:47.995 --> 26:52.983
wondered if you wanted
to get coffee again after.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.614
So, anyway, I guess
I'll see you there.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.246
Okay. Bye.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.665
Good afternoon.

27:42.666 --> 27:47.598
I just want to begin by thanking each
and every one of you for joining us today.

27:47.600 --> 27:52.499
My name is Denise Meadows, and I'm the
director of the women's healing network.

27:52.505 --> 27:56.573
I'm a licensed therapist
and a grief counselor...

27:56.575 --> 27:59.677
and I've been in this
field for over twenty years.

27:59.679 --> 28:03.311
And what I can tell you is I
understand that it took a lot of courage

28:03.312 --> 28:05.312
for you to come here today.

28:05.337 --> 28:09.186
But I wanted to let you know
we all have something in common.

28:09.188 --> 28:13.753
We all have lost someone
that is very important to us.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.124
Excuse me.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.931
Is there something that
I can help you with?

28:53.101 --> 28:57.069
- Yes. Can I fill out an application?
- Sure.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.159
Here you are. You want to go ahead
and fill that out, bring it back on in?

29:05.260 --> 29:08.475
- Can I fill it out here?
- If you'd like.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.549
- There you go.
- Thank you.

29:57.996 --> 30:00.151
Peyton?

30:03.443 --> 30:05.342
Peyton?

30:07.206 --> 30:09.173
Peyton!

30:09.175 --> 30:10.908
Oh, my God.

30:10.910 --> 30:11.866
Peyton!

30:12.367 --> 30:13.811
- Please, help my son.
- Is everything okay here?

30:13.812 --> 30:17.793
My son... he was just... he was
literally standing here with me one se...

30:17.794 --> 30:19.674
- He was just right here.
- Can you tell me what he looks like?

30:19.709 --> 30:23.468
He's... Peyton! Where
are you?! He's...

30:23.522 --> 30:25.900
Ma'am, can you
describe your son to me?

30:25.992 --> 30:30.027
- He's blond. He's... he's three.
- Okay. Okay.

30:30.029 --> 30:34.131
- Oh, my God. I can't believe I lost him.
- Blond hair. What was he wearing?

30:34.133 --> 30:39.333
He's in a T-shirt. He's in his favorite...
he's in his favorite blue T-shirt.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.277
- Blue T-shirt, blond hair.
- Yeah, blue T-shirt, blond hair.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.730
- He's got blue eyes.
- Okay. Three years old.

30:43.765 --> 30:46.806
He'd never leave. Somebody took
him. I bet somebody took him!

30:46.812 --> 30:48.605
Okay, I tell you, I'm gonna
go look and see in the...

30:48.606 --> 30:51.278
Someone took him! I'm
gonna check outside!

30:51.313 --> 30:53.055
I will look on the internal
security cameras, ma'am...

30:53.056 --> 30:55.975
- and see if we can find him.
- Thank you so much. Peyton!

30:56.789 --> 30:59.523
Oh, please, Peyton!

32:19.670 --> 32:21.394
One new message.

32:22.841 --> 32:26.545
Hi, Esther. This is Melanie. Sorry
I'm just getting back to you now.

32:26.546 --> 32:30.675
I had some personal things to tend to today,
and I just couldn't make the meeting, but...

32:30.676 --> 32:35.101
I would love to get together again. I
would really hate to wait another week.

32:35.102 --> 32:38.290
How is tomorrow
afternoon looking for you?

32:38.291 --> 32:43.476
There's a great place that really helps
keep me centered... give me a call.

32:44.697 --> 32:47.108
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:57.067 --> 32:59.954
- There you go.
- Thank you.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.436
So, how are things?

33:07.286 --> 33:08.842
Okay.

33:09.444 --> 33:10.984
Good

33:13.192 --> 33:15.621
I hope it's okay that we came here.

33:16.429 --> 33:20.486
Sure. Do you come here a lot?

33:20.521 --> 33:24.731
I do. My son and I... we
used to come here together.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.017
I don't know. I suppose
it should hurt, but...

33:32.277 --> 33:36.313
Somehow, I get a bit of peace.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.478
What was his name?

33:40.653 --> 33:42.276
Peyton.

33:45.991 --> 33:49.664
What happened to the
driver... the drunk one?

33:50.429 --> 33:52.783
Oh, I don't know.

33:55.333 --> 33:59.240
I thought about asking, wanting to
know if it was instant for him...

34:01.039 --> 34:03.896
or if he suffered. But...

34:06.571 --> 34:09.054
Figured I'd rather not know.

34:10.581 --> 34:13.763
That way I can tell
myself that he suffered.

34:18.991 --> 34:21.199
I do feel lucky, though.

34:21.860 --> 34:26.996
Oh, some of these other women...
what they've been through.

34:28.770 --> 34:33.876
The absolute worst are the ones whose
kids have been taken... kidnapped.

34:36.475 --> 34:39.364
They say the worst thing about
losing a child through abduction

34:39.364 --> 34:42.396
and not knowing whether
they're alive or dead, it's...

34:42.397 --> 34:47.358
it's just that... the not knowing.

34:51.222 --> 34:53.206
For me...

34:54.987 --> 34:57.074
if it was me the...

34:58.198 --> 35:01.036
the worst part, the
thing that would just...

35:01.646 --> 35:03.765
Eat away at me,

35:04.903 --> 35:09.737
just sicken me would be the fact that
I would hope for my child to be dead.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.669
Most parents... they hope for
their child to be returned,

35:17.670 --> 35:19.937
that everything will be okay.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.454
But are they ever really okay?

35:24.456 --> 35:26.388
No, they're...

35:29.400 --> 35:31.406
broken.

37:55.144 --> 37:58.474
I forgot how much
I love fucking you.

38:08.152 --> 38:10.330
So, who was she?

38:11.139 --> 38:12.664
Who?

38:13.992 --> 38:18.028
That fucking bitch you
were with at the park.

38:18.030 --> 38:22.561
It's nobody. Just this
woman from my support group.

38:30.073 --> 38:32.673
You wouldn't be cheating
on me, would you?

38:34.146 --> 38:36.305
Of course not.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.830
I hope not.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.827
Not after what I did for you.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.090
God, I missed you.

39:00.337 --> 39:03.806
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
to understand any of this.

39:03.808 --> 39:07.176
I did it because you asked me to.

39:09.347 --> 39:13.056
Nobody else would have
done it. You know why?

39:13.652 --> 39:17.614
Because I'm the only
one who really loves you.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.810
You know that, right?

39:25.600 --> 39:28.357
So, why haven't you
been returning my calls?

39:32.203 --> 39:35.445
You said we shouldn't talk...

39:35.446 --> 39:37.659
- to be safe.
- I know.

39:38.194 --> 39:41.093
I said you shouldn't call me.

39:42.013 --> 39:46.223
How am I supposed to keep you
safe if I don't know where you are?

39:48.086 --> 39:52.389
- Next time I call, you answer, okay?
- Okay.

39:57.414 --> 39:59.157
Come here.

40:06.737 --> 40:10.541
Mommy knows what she's doing, okay?

40:10.542 --> 40:13.154
I'm gonna keep you safe.

40:30.823 --> 40:32.904
That's my girl.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.861
That's my girl.

42:38.822 --> 42:43.526
- Hello?
- Hi, Esther. It's Melanie.

42:43.528 --> 42:46.996
- Oh, hi.
- I hope I'm not calling too late.

42:46.998 --> 42:48.766
No, it's fine.

42:48.767 --> 42:53.369
Good. I was actually wondering
if you're up for a late coffee.

42:53.371 --> 42:57.006
Well, I'm not really dressed.

42:57.008 --> 43:00.841
Oh, okay. It's kind
of last minute anyway.

43:00.846 --> 43:04.948
- Um, maybe tomorrow, then?
- Do you want to just come over here?

43:05.450 --> 43:08.518
Are you sure? I-I
wouldn't want to impose.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.921
No. I'd love to see you again.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.524
Okay, I'll be right over.

43:14.526 --> 43:16.660
Um, where do you live?

43:25.202 --> 43:28.835
- I think I owe you an apology.
- Why?

43:28.933 --> 43:31.975
Well, the last time you asked
to get together, I just...

43:31.977 --> 43:35.912
all I did was talk about myself
the whole time, my problems.

43:36.414 --> 43:39.347
It's okay. I like listening to you.

43:39.537 --> 43:44.780
Well, tonight it's about
you, if you're ready to talk.

43:50.695 --> 43:52.895
I, um...

43:56.800 --> 44:01.821
I was pregnant almost nine months,

44:02.277 --> 44:05.841
about two weeks away
from my due date.

44:06.143 --> 44:09.022
I hadn't had any complications.

44:09.614 --> 44:12.587
I'd had a great pregnancy.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.452
I loved it.

44:17.154 --> 44:22.558
People just treat you differently when
they know you're going to have a baby.

44:23.060 --> 44:26.933
Usually when I walk
down the street...

44:27.663 --> 44:33.069
people don't even notice me.
It's like I'm not even there.

44:33.971 --> 44:37.293
But then suddenly they saw me.

44:37.776 --> 44:43.209
Not only that, they wanted to touch
me, and they were smiling at me.

44:44.082 --> 44:49.393
And it was like just me
being there made them happy.

44:55.592 --> 45:00.562
Were you excited...
about being a mother?

45:03.467 --> 45:06.426
I never wanted to be a mother.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.402
I don't understand.

45:12.910 --> 45:16.776
I think you're the only
one who understands.

45:24.388 --> 45:28.891
- Esther, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

45:29.493 --> 45:32.762
Why... why would you do that?

45:32.764 --> 45:35.251
I'm so sorry. I thought
you wanted me to.

45:35.297 --> 45:37.669
You thought I wanted you to?

45:40.138 --> 45:41.871
I'm not a lesbian.

45:41.873 --> 45:43.941
Neither am I.

45:44.943 --> 45:47.077
I think I should go.

45:51.292 --> 45:53.680
I saw you with your son.

46:05.900 --> 46:07.139
At the...

46:11.809 --> 46:14.957
You don't know what
you're talking about.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.352
Do you understand me?

46:18.943 --> 46:20.586
Do you?!

46:25.015 --> 46:28.388
I'm fine. You need help.

46:28.389 --> 46:31.521
You need help, Esther, and
it's not coming from me.

46:31.623 --> 46:36.259
Don't you ever, ever call me again.

51:41.364 --> 51:43.388
Okay, bath time.

51:43.389 --> 51:47.089
He's getting ready, and I laid
his jammies out on the bed.

51:50.425 --> 51:53.143
Babe, could you do it tonight?

51:54.145 --> 51:56.278
You kidding me?

51:56.580 --> 51:59.715
- Please?
- Don't give me that look. I...

51:59.717 --> 52:03.619
- Oh, come on. I'm watching this.
- I do the bath every night.

52:04.555 --> 52:07.462
You're like cool, fun dad.
You get to read and play games,

52:07.463 --> 52:10.625
- and then I bathe and I...
- That's right. I'm cool, fun dad.

52:10.678 --> 52:16.765
Cool, fun dad. Cool, fun dad is deep into
a game with only 15 minutes left. Please?

53:32.749 --> 53:34.933
Peyton?

53:36.113 --> 53:38.080
Bath time!

53:38.082 --> 53:39.449
Hey, you.

53:40.851 --> 53:43.154
Peyton, let's do this!

53:45.803 --> 53:47.417
Peyton!

53:48.125 --> 53:49.461
No, no, no, no, no!

53:51.503 --> 53:54.743
Please! No!

53:57.101 --> 53:59.134
Stay with mommy. Come here.

53:59.136 --> 54:01.570
Peyton, please, no, no, no.

54:01.872 --> 54:03.923
What's wrong?!

54:05.442 --> 54:08.644
Ambulance! Call an ambulance!

54:08.646 --> 54:10.332
Go!

54:11.482 --> 54:13.574
God, please, no!

54:18.656 --> 54:20.289
Please, Peyton.

54:20.291 --> 54:22.958
Please stay with
mommy. Stay with mommy.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.294
I'm so sorry.

54:25.296 --> 54:28.063
God, please, please.

54:31.535 --> 54:33.535
Please don't be scared.

54:33.540 --> 54:35.907
What... what are you doing here?

54:36.741 --> 54:41.076
- Did you do this?
- I did it for you.

54:41.078 --> 54:42.627
No.

54:45.182 --> 54:48.907
I would never hurt you.

54:53.324 --> 54:59.008
I just came to do the
things you couldn't do.

55:00.197 --> 55:02.550
Don't you see?

55:04.068 --> 55:07.068
So we can be together.

55:08.506 --> 55:10.371
Melanie.

55:12.810 --> 55:15.438
No more lies.

55:15.813 --> 55:18.788
We're the same.

59:01.275 --> 59:03.557
Hel...

59:04.951 --> 59:06.461
Hello?

59:06.744 --> 59:08.712
Melanie?

59:09.980 --> 59:13.828
- Yes?
- Hey. It's Laurie.

59:15.386 --> 59:19.045
- Hi, Laurie.
- How are you doing, honey?

59:23.726 --> 59:27.328
Oh, you know. Getting by.

59:27.330 --> 59:30.465
Just kind of hard
getting back to things.

59:30.467 --> 59:34.446
Oh, honey. We've
all been so worried.

59:34.447 --> 59:38.337
I've tried to call so many times,
and no one has seen you guys.

59:38.338 --> 59:41.843
Have... have you been
out of the house at all?

59:41.845 --> 59:43.579
No.

59:44.548 --> 59:48.166
No. Not since...

59:48.167 --> 59:51.930
We need to get you out of
there. You need to talk to us.

59:51.974 --> 59:55.493
I'm calling Megan right now and
telling her we're going to lunch today.

59:57.494 --> 01:00:01.835
- No, I-I can't. I just... it's too soon.
- Honey, please.

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:05.042
- You need to...
- I said I can't.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.491
Sorry. Bye.

01:01:21.074 --> 01:01:23.648
She was talking to you.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.860
What?

01:01:36.617 --> 01:01:39.672
When I came back, she
was talking to you.

01:01:42.766 --> 01:01:46.050
Before I shot her right there...

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.404
she was talking to you.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.157
What was she saying?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.214
Only that you were next.

01:03:44.068 --> 01:03:45.709
She's gonna love this.

01:03:45.722 --> 01:03:49.596
I doubt that. She's fucking dead.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:53.028
Oh, damn. I'm sorry, honey.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:54.946
What happened?

01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:57.966
Some dickless piece
of shit shot her.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:04:01.760
Holy fuck. That's pretty hardcore.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:05.540
- Is that little girl you've been seeing?
- Yeah.

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:09.674
And not only that, but they're trying
to say that she killed their kid.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.438
Shit. Oh, fuck, I remember
hearing about this.

01:04:14.439 --> 01:04:15.874
Didn't it happen right
after you went in?

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:19.278
It was right before, but I
didn't find out until I got out.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.903
- How did you hear about it?
- Small town.

01:04:21.904 --> 01:04:24.604
Plus I'm sure you read
about it in the paper.

01:04:24.613 --> 01:04:25.690
What paper?

01:04:25.691 --> 01:04:28.744
The newspaper? They don't
have newspapers in there?

01:04:28.779 --> 01:04:31.099
I don't know who the
fuck reads newspapers.

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:35.400
Uh, whoever wants to know what
the fuck's going on, I guess.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.231
- So?
- So... what?

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.555
So, what the fuck
did the newspaper say?

01:04:41.556 --> 01:04:43.821
Oh, I don't know. What you said.

01:04:43.822 --> 01:04:47.282
That someone was killed
after killing some kid.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:51.119
- Did it say their names?
- The parents?

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.708
Yeah.

01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:55.614
Hmm, I don't remember.

01:04:55.615 --> 01:04:58.115
But I'm sure you can
look it up online.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:01.010
Pat?

01:06:03.227 --> 01:06:05.602
What?

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:09.363
What are you looking at?

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:12.961
A truck.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.846
A truck?

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:21.943
This truck's just
been sitting there.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.514
Hasn't moved since...

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:28.116
that night.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:29.549
You hungry? I...

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:36.224
This fucking truck has been
parked out there since that night.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:39.991
- It hasn't moved.
- Okay, I see it.

01:06:41.264 --> 01:06:43.225
Pat.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.101
Patrick.

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:48.703
You're hurting my arm.

01:06:52.774 --> 01:06:54.883
Where are you going?

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:04.503
I thought I'd go to... to
Peyton's school and get his things.

01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:06.854
Thought maybe we could go together.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.249
Your dad called earlier. He...

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:40.089
He was wondering when
you'd be back in the office.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.201
Everyone misses you.

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.770
That second shot.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:03.559
What?

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:07.100
I shouldn't have
taken that second shot.

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:14.263
I could have tried to
stop the bleeding...

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:18.792
Told the police she got away.

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:26.868
I could have found out who she was.

01:08:28.173 --> 01:08:31.885
I have all those
tools in the basement.

01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:36.671
I could have figured out why.

01:08:40.322 --> 01:08:43.358
Then I could have
done it the right way.

01:10:21.998 --> 01:10:23.992
Mr. Verdel?

01:10:25.283 --> 01:10:27.084
Mrs. Michaels.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:31.726
- Is this a good time?
- Of course. Come in.

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:35.280
The students are at recess.

01:10:42.448 --> 01:10:44.591
How are you getting along?

01:10:47.143 --> 01:10:49.603
One day at a time, I guess.

01:10:51.448 --> 01:10:55.628
Thank you for coming to the
funeral, by the way, and...

01:10:55.638 --> 01:10:59.660
for your card. I'm
sorry I haven't...

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:02.590
haven't had a chance to get around
to get around to thank-you note yet.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.733
No, please, I'm... I'm not
expecting anything like that.

01:11:05.734 --> 01:11:10.084
I'm just sorry more of the other
students didn't attend the services.

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:14.173
I don't think children
need to be at funerals.

01:11:14.253 --> 01:11:16.639
It's not really the place for them.

01:11:22.893 --> 01:11:25.345
I'm sorry. I just, um...

01:11:28.815 --> 01:11:32.453
I don't really know...
What am I supposed to do?

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.440
Am I supposed to just
get his things or...

01:11:34.441 --> 01:11:37.108
Yes, I-I have everything together.

01:11:41.307 --> 01:11:43.932
I didn't mean for you
to have to come here.

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:48.821
Would have dropped it
off when you were ready.

01:11:50.509 --> 01:11:55.610
Guess I didn't know when
that was gonna be, you know?

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.884
Turned out it was today.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:04.686
It's mostly art projects,
crafts, paintings,

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:07.440
some supplies, things like that.

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.331
Ms. Michaels?

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.266
Ms. Michaels.

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:57.096
I'm sorry, but the students
will be back in just a minute.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.776
Of course. Yes.

01:13:06.047 --> 01:13:11.249
Thank you, Mr. Verdel,
for all your help.

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:25.175
Hi, Laurie.

01:14:25.698 --> 01:14:29.453
Um, little bit better
today. Thank you.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:35.132
I was actually wondering if that
offer for lunch was still on the table.

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:39.040
I just could really get
out of the house today.

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:43.144
Oh, I don't care. Anywhere's great.

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:46.977
Sure, um, that sounds wonderful.

01:14:48.838 --> 01:14:51.571
Thank you so much for doing this.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:56.925
No, I'll just... I'll talk
to you when I see you.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:00.381
Okay. Bye.

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.116
Can I help you, dear?

01:15:18.117 --> 01:15:21.024
Yeah, I want to talk to
the guy who wrote this.

01:15:21.059 --> 01:15:23.671
Uh-huh. And what
is this regarding?

01:15:23.672 --> 01:15:25.052
This.

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:29.304
I see. Unfortunately, I'm not able to
allow direct access to the reporters.

01:15:29.305 --> 01:15:32.569
I can give you a phone number to
the news desk or an e-mail address.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.156
Why? Why can't I just talk to him?

01:15:34.157 --> 01:15:36.538
- As I just explained...
- Is he back there right now?

01:15:36.555 --> 01:15:40.268
That is beside the point. Ma'am,
you are not allowed back there.

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:41.634
I'm calling security.

01:15:41.635 --> 01:15:46.938
Raymond Sheeley? Which one
of you is Raymond Sheeley?

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.572
- Can I help you?
- Are you Raymond Sheeley?

01:15:53.573 --> 01:15:56.021
- No, but...
- Well, then get the fuck out of my way.

01:16:04.437 --> 01:16:06.986
Are you Raymond Sheeley?
Did you write this?

01:16:06.987 --> 01:16:08.387
- Yeah.
- What were their names?

01:16:08.388 --> 01:16:10.669
- Who?
- The people that shot her.

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:13.143
- I can't tell you that.
- Don't fuck with me, Raymond.

01:16:13.178 --> 01:16:14.991
- What were their fucking names?!
- I don't know! They...

01:16:14.992 --> 01:16:16.363
They didn't want them disclosed!

01:16:16.387 --> 01:16:18.172
- It's time to go, miss.
- Get your hands off me.

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.807
Get your hands off me!

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:23.816
Get me those names, Raymond!
I said get your hands off me!

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:35.219
Come back again,
we'll call the police.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:13.019
Patrick?

01:19:25.092 --> 01:19:28.362
One new message. Message one.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.120
Hello. This message is
for Melanie Michaels.

01:19:31.121 --> 01:19:33.621
I'm calling from the
channel 8 news desk.

01:19:33.632 --> 01:19:38.472
We received your message and are very
sorry to hear about the loss of your son.

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:42.672
Unfortunately, it turns out we
ran a segment on this incident...

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:46.779
Message deleted. No new messages.

01:20:51.145 --> 01:20:53.145
You are home.

01:20:57.952 --> 01:20:59.985
Where else would I be?

01:21:02.214 --> 01:21:04.975
Pat, you don't look so good.

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:10.398
How should the father
with a dead son look?

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.738
Babe, you can't think like that.

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:18.765
Or maybe you should.

01:21:24.078 --> 01:21:26.328
And what's that supposed to mean?

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:32.219
Nothing.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.288
Nothing.

01:21:41.295 --> 01:21:44.073
Why don't you come
upstairs with me?

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:49.155
I got something to show you.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.551
Come on.

01:22:40.504 --> 01:22:42.923
He's all around us.

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:13.373
We're gonna be okay.

01:23:14.182 --> 01:23:16.008
Babe.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:19.927
I know. I know.

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.902
I know.

01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:41.748
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:53.841
We could always have another one.

01:24:31.723 --> 01:24:35.402
- Morning, dad.
- Morning.

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:37.954
It's good to have you back.

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:46.274
How you doing?

01:24:48.207 --> 01:24:52.098
I don't know how to answer
that question anymore.

01:24:53.816 --> 01:24:55.426
Okay.

01:24:55.919 --> 01:24:59.328
You know I'm right next door
if you need to talk or...

01:24:59.329 --> 01:25:01.785
just want to get out of here early.

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:09.191
All right. Thanks, dad.

01:25:09.989 --> 01:25:12.532
It's good to see you, son.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:56.984
- Detective Oler.
- Detective Oler, hi.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:26:01.543
- Uh, this is Patrick Michaels.
- Yes?

01:26:02.774 --> 01:26:07.551
You're investigating the
death of my son, Peyton.

01:26:08.336 --> 01:26:12.407
Yes, I remember, Mr.
Michaels. How can I help you?

01:26:13.983 --> 01:26:19.445
Well, I found something that
I felt I should tell you about.

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:21.176
Okay.

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:28.545
There's a truck that's been parked
on our street ever since that day.

01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:31.911
- It hasn't moved.
- Uh-huh.

01:26:33.455 --> 01:26:39.219
Well, I went into the truck, and I found
a vehicle registration card for Anika...

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.934
What do you mean,
went inside of it?

01:26:44.099 --> 01:26:46.632
I went inside the truck.

01:26:46.633 --> 01:26:49.633
Mr. Michaels, did you
break into this vehicle?

01:26:50.406 --> 01:26:52.673
N... no.

01:26:52.975 --> 01:26:55.875
It was unlocked.
I just opened the door.

01:26:55.876 --> 01:27:00.412
It does not matter if it was unlocked.
Did you take anything from the vehicle?

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:06.149
Vehicle? Well, like I was just saying,
I found this vehicle registration card.

01:27:06.155 --> 01:27:11.360
Mr. Michaels, you really must leave this
to us. I understand that you're upset.

01:27:11.384 --> 01:27:15.482
Now, I suggest you return whatever items
you took from the vehicle immediately.

01:27:15.483 --> 01:27:17.307
I will have someone
check it out today,

01:27:17.308 --> 01:27:20.651
and we'll be sure to notify
you if anything develops.

01:27:24.805 --> 01:27:27.000
- Mr. Michaels?
- Fine.

01:27:30.546 --> 01:27:32.458
Fuck!

01:27:50.275 --> 01:27:52.059
Peyton?

01:27:56.757 --> 01:27:59.495
Peyton, mommy can't see you.

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:07.948
Peyton?

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:29.838
Excuse me.

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:33.054
You dropped your hat.

01:28:35.411 --> 01:28:37.346
Here you go.

01:28:42.783 --> 01:28:44.527
That's mine over there.

01:28:45.677 --> 01:28:49.925
I think we've seen you here a few
times before. Which one's yours?

01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:42.108
- Hello?
- Hey, Laurie, I-it's me.

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.328
Hey. How are you?

01:29:44.993 --> 01:29:46.844
Um... I'm okay.

01:29:47.844 --> 01:29:52.345
I was actually wondering if maybe we could
get together and do lunch again today.

01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:55.689
Oh, honey, I'm
sorry, I can't today.

01:29:58.794 --> 01:30:00.952
Are you sure? I-I just...

01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:03.784
I could really use
someone to talk to today.

01:30:03.785 --> 01:30:05.960
No, I just can't.

01:30:06.195 --> 01:30:09.903
- Okay. No, no, I get it.
- Have you tried to call Megan?

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:12.391
Yeah, you know what? I don't
even... I don't even have her number.

01:30:12.392 --> 01:30:13.492
Do you think you
could give it to me?

01:30:13.769 --> 01:30:16.668
- Sure.
- Okay, just hold on one sec, okay?

01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:17.669
Yeah.

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:29.049
Okay. Go ahead.

01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:35.067
Okay, it's 969-1134.

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:41.550
- You there?
- No, no, I'm here.

01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:45.439
Okay. Well, talk
to you soon, honey.

01:30:45.441 --> 01:30:47.774
Okay. Thanks.

01:31:15.071 --> 01:31:18.198
I'm gonna step out
for a minute, son.

01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:04.484
Mel, it's Marshall.
I have Patrick here.

01:32:04.486 --> 01:32:07.687
We're at the hospital, the E.R.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:12.392
He hurt himself, but he's
okay, physically, I guess.

01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:18.061
Look, they're concerned about him here,
and so am I, how he's handling Peyton.

01:32:18.096 --> 01:32:22.068
They're sending us to some kind of
support group for this sort of thing.

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:27.640
Look, I have to get back to the office,
but I really think you should be there.

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:29.586
He needs you right now.

01:32:29.587 --> 01:32:34.232
The group is in an hour.
It's at some church loca...

01:34:02.612 --> 01:34:04.706
Come on.

01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:10.442
Esther, come on.

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:34.067
Thank God.

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:24.143
Patrick?

01:36:25.492 --> 01:36:28.272
Would you like to
introduce yourself?

01:36:28.572 --> 01:36:31.585
No, I was told that
I didn't have to talk.

01:36:32.152 --> 01:36:35.785
That's true. You don't have to.

01:36:37.304 --> 01:36:39.859
I'm... hi. I'm Patrick Michaels.

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:42.962
Would you mind standing
up for us, Patrick?

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:51.658
My name is Patrick Michaels.

01:36:54.625 --> 01:36:58.560
Uh, I'm here because my
son Peyton was murdered,

01:36:58.614 --> 01:37:01.414
and I can't stop thinking about it.

01:37:04.210 --> 01:37:09.817
I can't stop thinking about
his little body laying there...

01:37:10.625 --> 01:37:15.277
And h... how he's never
gonna smile at me again,

01:37:15.278 --> 01:37:20.643
and I can't stop thinking about
the woman that did it and...

01:37:21.852 --> 01:37:26.908
All the things that I want to do to her,
all the ways that I want to hurt her.

01:37:27.309 --> 01:37:29.242
Okay.

01:37:29.644 --> 01:37:33.308
Let's try redirecting this anger.

01:37:34.549 --> 01:37:38.644
What do you miss most about Peyton?

01:37:44.459 --> 01:37:49.227
I miss not feeling guilty
about being a bad father.

01:37:56.186 --> 01:37:57.891
Um, I...

01:37:58.426 --> 01:38:01.415
You know, I used to feel like..

01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:04.544
uh, working and making money,

01:38:04.546 --> 01:38:09.060
uh, providing a home and food

01:38:09.061 --> 01:38:16.015
for my family was enough, you know,
was the role that, uh, I played.

01:38:20.662 --> 01:38:23.022
And now all...

01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:29.003
I can think about is just the
things that we didn't do together,

01:38:29.084 --> 01:38:33.900
time that I didn't spend with him,
things we'll never get to do together,

01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:38.591
and all the times that
I said, "not now"...

01:38:40.871 --> 01:38:44.759
To this little boy that just
wanted to play with his dad...

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:52.486
How I was too...

01:38:53.071 --> 01:38:55.685
busy or too tired.

01:39:05.818 --> 01:39:08.249
Uh, I miss...

01:39:09.784 --> 01:39:13.092
taking my entire life for granted.

01:39:24.658 --> 01:39:27.327
- Mr. Michaels.
- Yes?

01:39:27.829 --> 01:39:30.930
- Hi. I'm Elliot.
- Patrick.

01:39:31.132 --> 01:39:33.480
Sorry. I-I don't
mean to bother you.

01:39:33.481 --> 01:39:35.807
I just wanted to say
that I really appreciated

01:39:35.808 --> 01:39:38.853
what you had to say
back there, your honesty.

01:39:39.453 --> 01:39:41.697
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:39:41.699 --> 01:39:45.078
I've been coming to
these for some time now.

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.114
You don't see it that often.

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:49.846
I'm sure your wife's happy
that you're coming now, too.

01:39:49.898 --> 01:39:51.930
You know, I lost my little
girl about four years ago...

01:39:51.931 --> 01:39:54.354
What do you mean,
"coming now, too"?

01:39:54.454 --> 01:39:58.609
Well, it's just that I've seen her
at several of... Melanie, right?

01:39:58.793 --> 01:40:01.361
Yes. Melanie's been here?

01:40:01.563 --> 01:40:07.316
Well, sure. I'd say off
and on for about a year now.

01:40:07.716 --> 01:40:11.476
But our son only died a month ago.

01:40:12.674 --> 01:40:16.005
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
I must have made a mista...

01:40:16.011 --> 01:40:18.871
It's just... I-I remembered the name
Peyton and that he'd been kidnapped,

01:40:18.872 --> 01:40:20.723
and I thought she said her
husband's name was Patrick.

01:40:20.724 --> 01:40:26.065
Our son wasn't kidnapped. He...
He was murdered in our house.

01:40:26.265 --> 01:40:30.356
Again, I'm sorry. I must be wrong.

01:40:33.705 --> 01:40:36.730
- It's nice to have met you.
- Hold on.

01:40:39.294 --> 01:40:42.469
- I really should get going.
- Wait.

01:41:11.328 --> 01:41:13.429
- Who are you?
- Anika Baron?

01:41:13.438 --> 01:41:15.212
It's "ah-ni-kah."
Who are you?

01:41:15.213 --> 01:41:19.640
I'm Detective Oler with the Richmond
police department. May I come in?

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.348
No. Let's just do it here.

01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:26.358
Would you like to
put some clothes on?

01:41:26.558 --> 01:41:29.838
No, not really. Why?
You don't like this?

01:41:31.019 --> 01:41:33.524
Did you recently report
a vehicle missing?

01:41:33.724 --> 01:41:36.060
Yeah, my truck, like a month ago.

01:41:36.061 --> 01:41:39.582
- A 2005 Chevy, red?
- Yeah.

01:41:39.583 --> 01:41:42.806
And you reported it before you
went to county for four weeks

01:41:42.807 --> 01:41:44.626
on an assault and battery charge?

01:41:44.627 --> 01:41:48.302
Well, I thought the fucking bitch
had taken it. Guess I was wrong.

01:41:48.803 --> 01:41:50.241
Right.

01:41:51.473 --> 01:41:54.082
So, what? You actually found it?

01:41:54.083 --> 01:41:57.234
We found it abandoned
in the Reeveston area.

01:41:57.579 --> 01:41:59.579
Reeveston?

01:41:59.581 --> 01:42:02.581
- Yeah.
- So, can I go get it?

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:06.139
Actually, no. It's being taken down
to the impound lot this afternoon

01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.886
for processing and
further investigation.

01:42:08.986 --> 01:42:11.780
Further investigation for
what? You fucking found it.

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.176
That's why I came
here to talk to you.

01:42:14.177 --> 01:42:18.522
Your vehicle is being entered as
potential evidence in a homicide.

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.014
There was a break-in in that
area, and a child was murdered.

01:42:25.878 --> 01:42:28.155
I don't know anything about that.

01:42:28.355 --> 01:42:30.109
I didn't say you did,

01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:33.446
but you will need to come down for
a formal statement about the vehicle,

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:37.643
- make sure nothing's Missing.
- When do I get my truck back?

01:42:37.644 --> 01:42:41.231
Once we've established
there's no connection.

01:42:41.232 --> 01:42:45.336
In the meantime, if you think of
anybody who might have taken the vehicle,

01:42:45.337 --> 01:42:47.171
give me a call.

01:42:47.996 --> 01:42:49.506
Fine.

01:42:49.507 --> 01:42:53.313
Thank you for your time. And we'll
be in touch about that statement.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:38.116
Last night, a home invasion in
Richmond came to a tragic end

01:43:38.117 --> 01:43:39.917
with the death of a young boy.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.080
The father shot and killed the intruder
before she had a chance to flee the scene.

01:43:44.205 --> 01:43:47.587
With more on this terrible
tragedy, we go to Tom Warren.

01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:51.183
Thanks, Larry. Details are still
uncertain at this time as to exactly

01:43:51.184 --> 01:43:54.994
what happened in this home. We do
know the forensics team is alre...

01:43:58.214 --> 01:44:00.478
We tried to speak with
the mother of the deceased,

01:44:00.479 --> 01:44:04.675
but she's understandably distraught,
and she's unable to comment.

01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:39.217
Where have you been?

01:44:42.647 --> 01:44:44.749
Thinking.

01:44:45.483 --> 01:44:48.297
Okay. A-about what?

01:44:52.403 --> 01:44:57.408
Trying to make sense out of a lot
of things that don't make sense.

01:44:59.823 --> 01:45:02.275
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:45:05.084 --> 01:45:08.126
What have you been telling
people about Peyton?

01:45:10.514 --> 01:45:12.008
I...

01:45:12.009 --> 01:45:14.807
What have you been
saying about my son?

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:19.278
I don't... I don't know what
you mean. I... nothing...

01:45:26.239 --> 01:45:27.981
Patrick.

01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:32.044
Oh, my God.

01:45:35.428 --> 01:45:39.431
It's time for you to
stop lying to me, okay?

01:45:39.483 --> 01:45:42.867
It's time for you to stop lying!

01:45:43.538 --> 01:45:46.093
I'm not. Look...

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.523
I don't know what you
think you know, but...

01:45:47.524 --> 01:45:51.813
How do they know about you,
then?! How do they know about him?!

01:45:51.814 --> 01:45:55.523
Who? Who? How does who know what?

01:45:55.524 --> 01:45:58.317
Patrick, please, come on.

01:45:58.319 --> 01:46:00.891
Who the fuck was she?

01:46:02.456 --> 01:46:04.715
Who was she?!

01:46:07.228 --> 01:46:10.336
I don't know, okay? Is that what
you want me to say? I don't know!

01:46:10.337 --> 01:46:14.766
I wish I knew, but I... Please,
babe, just put that down.

01:46:21.413 --> 01:46:24.379
I'm sorry, Mel.
I can't do this anymore.

01:46:30.953 --> 01:46:33.286
Look at me, okay? Just look at me.

01:46:33.349 --> 01:46:35.192
Put that down. We
just... we need to talk.

01:46:35.193 --> 01:46:38.679
- It's just us, okay?
- It's too late for talking.

01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:44.675
I can't even stand
to be around you.

01:46:45.466 --> 01:46:47.990
I need to leave.

01:46:51.405 --> 01:46:53.857
What are you saying?

01:47:00.854 --> 01:47:03.091
I just need to go.

01:47:15.995 --> 01:47:18.397
- So, he tell you where to find it?
- Kind of.

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:21.446
- Did you get what I asked?
- Hmm.

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:26.605
- I don't even want to know.
- Good.

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:28.732
- Reeveston.
- Okay.

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:58.471
There.

01:48:05.363 --> 01:48:08.774
- You're gonna just take it?
- That's what's gonna happen.

01:48:09.028 --> 01:48:11.984
All right. I'll see
you later, then.

01:48:12.734 --> 01:48:14.698
Thanks, bitch.

01:49:03.999 --> 01:49:06.609
This must be the right house.

01:49:20.198 --> 01:49:23.474
Just... just relax. Just relax.

01:49:23.475 --> 01:49:26.940
We're... we're just getting... we're
just getting to know each other.

01:49:44.224 --> 01:49:47.298
- What do you want?
- No, no, no, no.

01:49:47.314 --> 01:49:50.489
We're not gonna play
that game, you know,

01:49:50.490 --> 01:49:52.785
'cause you know
exactly why I'm here.

01:49:52.787 --> 01:49:58.120
You fucked my girl, and your dickless
piece of shit husband shot her.

01:49:58.835 --> 01:50:02.128
So, you don't get
to ask any questions.

01:50:02.129 --> 01:50:05.431
You don't get to
tell me any stories.

01:50:05.633 --> 01:50:09.902
But since it looks like we've
got a little bit of time...

01:50:09.904 --> 01:50:12.492
I'd like to get some answers.

01:50:12.493 --> 01:50:15.841
Number one... how the
fuck do you know me?

01:50:16.143 --> 01:50:18.110
I don't know you. I don't know...

01:50:21.774 --> 01:50:25.104
I'm... I'm sorry. Uh, continue.

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:36.381
- I saw you at Esther's house.
- Hmm.

01:50:37.231 --> 01:50:40.766
Okay. So, does your husband
know that you've gone dyke?

01:50:40.768 --> 01:50:43.936
What? No. I'm not.
What are you tal...

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:49.095
Stop hitting me, please! I
didn't even do anything with her!

01:50:52.513 --> 01:50:56.701
Okay. I believe you.

01:50:57.141 --> 01:50:59.927
It's too bad. She was good.

01:51:00.287 --> 01:51:02.642
She was crazy.

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:07.286
That's what made her a great fuck.

01:51:20.008 --> 01:51:23.029
Oh, don't worry. That...
that's not for you.

01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:27.106
That's for your husband. You
see, it's like so few men...

01:51:27.107 --> 01:51:31.304
get the chance to know what
it's really like to get fucked.

01:51:31.890 --> 01:51:33.780
So...

01:51:33.781 --> 01:51:35.120
Since he doesn't have
that much time left,

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:38.427
I figured I'd show him.
And... and you can watch.

01:51:39.293 --> 01:51:41.594
You're sick.

01:51:41.596 --> 01:51:43.283
Yeah.

01:51:43.783 --> 01:51:47.874
And you haven't even heard what I've
got planned for you yet, princess.

01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:52.972
You do know she killed my child.

01:51:53.674 --> 01:51:56.817
And whose fault is that?

01:52:06.384 --> 01:52:10.752
So, where is he? I
don't have all day.

01:52:12.893 --> 01:52:15.126
I don't know.

01:52:15.863 --> 01:52:18.864
He left. He's probably
never coming back.

01:52:19.066 --> 01:52:21.162
I'll take my chances.

01:52:25.938 --> 01:52:29.107
- Is the kitchen that way?
- What?

01:53:07.284 --> 01:53:10.323
- Where's your toilet?
- What?

01:53:11.718 --> 01:53:13.589
Your head.

01:53:14.688 --> 01:53:17.089
Down the hall.

01:53:23.563 --> 01:53:25.679
What's that?

01:53:26.123 --> 01:53:29.612
- What?
- That sound.

01:53:29.904 --> 01:53:31.894
Like water running.

01:53:32.094 --> 01:53:34.940
I don't know.
I don't hear anything.

01:53:35.963 --> 01:53:39.289
That's a fucking shower. Is that
a fucking shower? Is he upstairs?

01:53:39.301 --> 01:53:41.736
I don't know what you're talking
about. I don't even hear anything.

01:53:41.749 --> 01:53:45.651
Wow. You are a
sneaky, little bitch.

01:53:46.053 --> 01:53:50.465
He's fucking upstairs taking
a shower. Unbelievable.

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:35.508
Oh, fuck me.

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:41.117
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck you!

01:54:41.156 --> 01:54:45.210
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

01:54:45.363 --> 01:54:48.552
Oh, shut up already, please.

01:54:51.237 --> 01:54:54.786
Although, you know, I
should be thanking you.

01:54:54.788 --> 01:54:58.257
You've made this a
much better story.

01:54:59.059 --> 01:55:03.541
Oh, my God. You are fucked up.

01:55:03.542 --> 01:55:07.114
No wonder Esther fucking liked you.

01:55:20.241 --> 01:55:23.531
Our next story is that of
every mother's worst nightmare.

01:55:23.532 --> 01:55:27.322
Two years ago, an unknown intruder
broke into the home of Melanie Michaels.

01:55:27.323 --> 01:55:29.621
Her son was tragically
murdered by the intruder,

01:55:29.623 --> 01:55:32.786
who was then shot and killed by
her husband when trying to escape.

01:55:32.787 --> 01:55:36.362
One month later, the vengeful
lover of the intruder returned,

01:55:36.363 --> 01:55:38.261
Taking the life of her husband.

01:55:38.262 --> 01:55:42.769
Melanie was then forced out of
self-defense to kill the second assailant.

01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:46.674
I had the opportunity to sit down with
Mrs. Michaels and talk about her story.

01:55:47.051 --> 01:55:50.742
- Melanie, thank you for being with us.
- Thank you so much for having me.

01:55:50.744 --> 01:55:55.445
I am so sorry for your terrible loss. This
is truly every mother's worst nightmare.

01:55:55.446 --> 01:55:57.490
How are you handling everything?

01:55:57.491 --> 01:56:00.272
Well, I don't think there's
ever really a way to handle it.

01:56:00.273 --> 01:56:03.119
It's just taking it
one day at a time.

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:07.459
But there isn't a moment
that goes by that...

01:56:08.267 --> 01:56:11.742
that I don't think
about my boys. Excuse me.

01:56:11.932 --> 01:56:15.974
I'm sure. But what you're not doing
and what you're being commended for

01:56:15.975 --> 01:56:18.978
is not allowing yourself
to become a victim.

01:56:18.979 --> 01:56:21.721
And, in fact, you've written a book
in order to turn your experience...

01:56:21.722 --> 01:56:24.798
- into education for other parents.
- Yes, I have.

01:56:24.799 --> 01:56:26.990
It's called "our children,
our responsibility,"

01:56:26.991 --> 01:56:31.296
and it details your story,
as well as, in retrospect,

01:56:31.297 --> 01:56:34.128
what you could have possibly
done to prevent this tragedy.

01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:36.718
Exactly. I feel that there's
a lot of parents out there...

01:56:36.737 --> 01:56:40.539
that take their child's safety,
as well as their own, for granted.

01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:43.669
And if I could just prevent
what happened to us...

01:56:43.670 --> 01:56:48.070
from happening to someone else, then I
feel that Peyton and Patrick's deaths,

01:56:48.071 --> 01:56:49.684
they will not have been in vain.

01:56:49.685 --> 01:56:54.339
Right. Well, it takes a very brave
parent to admit they made mistakes,

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:57.243
- especially so publicly.
- Thank you.

01:56:57.244 --> 01:57:00.632
I also understand that a few
television networks are interested...

01:57:00.633 --> 01:57:02.363
in turning your story into a movie?

01:57:02.364 --> 01:57:06.764
Yes, there's some talks and some
offers, but nothing's set in stone yet.

01:57:06.765 --> 01:57:09.915
Well, I wish you the best of
luck with that and your book.

01:57:09.916 --> 01:57:12.858
I know the more people that hear
your message and your story...

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:15.872
- the better off we'll all be.
- Thank you. That means a lot.

01:57:15.873 --> 01:57:19.528
And finally, I understand you
have another big announcement.

01:57:19.529 --> 01:57:21.570
I do.

01:57:21.588 --> 01:57:24.421
I recently got remarried, and...

01:57:24.422 --> 01:57:27.987
well, we found out
this morning that...

01:57:29.036 --> 01:57:31.167
I'm pregnant.

01:57:32.723 --> 01:57:36.289
Who the fuck are you talking to?

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:45.594
Everyone.
