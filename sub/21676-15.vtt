WEBVTT

00:13.999 --> 00:15.999
- Stormy seas ahead
as the crew reunites.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.000
- It's the dumbest thing you
possibly could have done.

00:17.999 --> 00:19.999
- It's part two
of the "Below Deck" reunion.

00:19.999 --> 00:21.999
Is there any chance
that tonight,

00:21.999 --> 00:23.999
the two of you will wind up
together?

00:23.999 --> 00:26.999
- What are you doing later,
babes?

00:26.999 --> 00:29.999
- Ugh. Most insane day
I've ever had in yachting.

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
- You screwed up.
That's the point

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
I'm trying to make,
is you don't own it.

00:33.999 --> 00:34.999
- What do you want me to own?

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
- As soon as a camera
would come around,

00:36.999 --> 00:39.999
she would literally turn into,
like, a theatrical lunatic.

00:39.999 --> 00:40.999
- But I really did think
we were friends.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.000
You said, "I hate her."

00:42.999 --> 00:43.999
- No, no, no,
I didn't hate you.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.000
I can't stand you.

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
- You took your clothes off
while we were on charter.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- Are you gonna hold on to this
for the rest of your life?

00:49.999 --> 00:52.999
- I think it's a bit
of a cop-out, to be honest.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
- Do you accept her apology?

00:54.999 --> 00:55.999
- When you're in a place where
your phone doesn't work,

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
and all you get
is a text message?

00:57.999 --> 00:58.999
Oh, that killed me.

00:58.999 --> 00:59.999
- If the health department

00:59.999 --> 01:00.999
had gone in there,

01:00.999 --> 01:02.999
they would have shut it down.

01:02.999 --> 01:03.999
- You and Eddie kind of gave
new meaning

01:03.999 --> 01:05.999
to the term "dirty laundry."

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
- I wouldn't call it
a "relationship."

01:07.999 --> 01:09.999
- Usually friends with benefits
act like friends.

01:09.999 --> 01:10.999
- You should have been fired.
You should never

01:10.999 --> 01:12.999
have been back there.
I had enough of it.

01:12.999 --> 01:13.999
- Why would you come to me?

01:13.999 --> 01:16.999
- Was there a part of you
that was jealous?

01:16.999 --> 01:17.999
So did you cut things off then?

01:17.999 --> 01:19.999
- I definitely didn't
have any kind

01:19.999 --> 01:21.999
of sexual interaction
with her anymore.

01:21.999 --> 01:22.999
- What about two times
after the show?

01:22.999 --> 01:26.999
- Oh!

01:26.999 --> 01:28.999
- We're not in
the laundry room anymore.

01:32.999 --> 01:33.999
- Were you drinking on charter?

01:33.999 --> 01:36.999
- Um, I was in the galley
making popcorn for the guests.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.999
You didn't know how to work
the DVD player,

01:38.999 --> 01:39.999
which you should've.
"The guests want popcorn

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
to watch their movie,
but I don't know how to do it."

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
So I said,
"I'll leave you in the galley

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
"where you're comfortable,
where you're trained,

01:45.999 --> 01:47.999
and I'll go do
what I'm good at."

01:47.999 --> 01:51.999
And I came back down
and everything was on fire.

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
- But then it wasn't aired.
- And I specifically asked Leon,

01:52.999 --> 01:55.999
"Leon, did you see
Kate drinking?"

01:55.999 --> 01:57.999
"No, I didn't."

01:57.999 --> 02:00.999
So either he was telling me
a lie when you said,

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
"I didn't see it,"
or he was telling me a lie

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
when he said she was drinking.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
One of those two is an untruth.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
- Amy, have you seen
Kate drink on charter?

02:09.999 --> 02:10.999
- No, I think
the pointing the fingers

02:10.999 --> 02:12.999
about the drinking
and this and that,

02:12.999 --> 02:13.999
it's--it's petty.

02:13.999 --> 02:18.999
It really is.
Like, it's ridiculous.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
- Okay, let's talk
about something else.

02:20.999 --> 02:23.999
Captain Lee, we got so many
viewer questions for you.

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
Everyone wants to know a lot
about you.

02:25.999 --> 02:27.999
You're such a man of mystery.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
Is it important for you

02:29.999 --> 02:33.000
to keep a certain distance
from the crew?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.999
- I think it's important
for the crew

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
for me to keep my distance.

02:36.999 --> 02:38.999
That's why rarely
do you see me

02:38.999 --> 02:41.999
eating with the crew
or hanging out with the crew.

02:41.999 --> 02:44.999
Because they need to have
their area where they can say,

02:44.999 --> 02:46.000
"God, that guy is such a dick,"

02:46.999 --> 02:48.999
without any fear of retribution
or anything else.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.999
And that's why I eat alone.

02:51.999 --> 02:55.999
- You were featured
in my favorite Bravo promo

02:55.999 --> 02:58.999
in my over-ten years
at the network.

02:58.999 --> 02:59.999
- Really? Well, thank you.
- Yes.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.999
Look, we have it.
Let's take a look at it.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
It's so good.

What'd your wife think of it?

03:30.999 --> 03:32.999
- Ah, she's gotten a lot
of mileage out of that.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
- She has? Yeah.
- A lot mileage, yeah.

03:34.999 --> 03:36.999
And, and, and it's still
working for her.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
- Yeah.
- Oh!

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
- You must a big celebrity
in the yachting community.

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
- Yes, he is, yes.
- I don't know.

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
- People in traffic...
- Yes.

03:44.999 --> 03:45.999
- Like, risk their lives.
They're, like, taking photos

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
of him driving his convertible.
- Yes.

03:47.999 --> 03:48.999
- I see it on Twitter
all the time.

03:48.999 --> 03:49.999
- Yes.
- People will ask me,

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
"Where's Captain Lee?"
whenever I'm around.

03:51.999 --> 03:52.999
- Mm-hmm.
- "Where's Captain Lee?"

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
- It's like,
"What's he like?

03:54.999 --> 03:55.999
Is he really like that?
What do you think about him?"

03:55.999 --> 03:57.999
Like, everyone wants to know
about Captain Lee.

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
- I feel like his first name
is Captain.

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
I'm like, "Hi, Captain!"
I'm like,

04:00.999 --> 04:01.999
"Is that weird that
I'm calling you that?"

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
- You know what,
what is your first name?

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
- Harold, yes.
- I just realized

04:05.999 --> 04:09.999
I haven't known your first name
for the entirety of this show.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.999
- You know, high school was
tough with a name like Harold.

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
- Wendy from Anaheim says,
"Captain Lee,

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
"where do you come up
with all your funny sayings?

04:17.999 --> 04:20.999
"Is there a book of
salty sea captain quotes

04:20.999 --> 04:24.999
they give you when you graduate
from the captain academy?"

04:24.999 --> 04:26.999
- It's just probably
lack of filter.

04:26.999 --> 04:27.999
I mean, we have
gone through deckhands

04:27.999 --> 04:30.999
like a condom salesman
at a whorehouse.

04:30.999 --> 04:31.999
We screwed the pooch
so many times,

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
we should have a f***ing
litter of puppies

04:33.999 --> 04:34.999
running around here somewhere.

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
I would rather drag my dick
through 10 miles

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
of broken whiskey bottles

04:37.999 --> 04:39.999
than have these ass****s
on my boat again.

04:39.999 --> 04:42.999
- Anyone have
a favorite Lee-ism?

04:42.999 --> 04:43.999
- "Screwed the pooch."
That's so good.

04:43.999 --> 04:44.999
I like that one.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
- He dropped a good one
here though.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
Tit wringer?
- Put your...

04:48.999 --> 04:49.999
Tit through the wringer.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
- When you get caught
with your tit in the wringer,

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
guess what, it's because
you put it there.

04:53.999 --> 04:56.999
- Rocky, I have to think
that you're not

04:56.999 --> 04:58.999
President of the Captain Lee
fan club.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.999
What do you think
of him as a captain?

05:00.999 --> 05:02.999
- You know,
I think that Captain Lee

05:02.999 --> 05:04.999
really supports his team

05:04.999 --> 05:07.999
and I think that Eddie and Kate
are right below him.

05:07.999 --> 05:09.999
That's his chief stew
and that's his head boatswain,

05:09.999 --> 05:12.999
and so he's gonna support them,
and so I get it.

05:12.999 --> 05:13.999
- It's not an alliance.

05:13.999 --> 05:16.999
It's called rank
and it's called a job.

05:16.999 --> 05:20.999
And yes, you were at
the bottom of the totem pole.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
- I was in your position last
season and I have to disagree.

05:22.999 --> 05:25.999
Like, I felt like he totally
supported the whole team.

05:25.999 --> 05:29.000
- I don't support anything
that I'm not behind

05:29.000 --> 05:32.999
or I don't believe in 100%,
and it's got to be honest.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.999
Eddie, Kate, everybody that has
ever worked with me

05:36.999 --> 05:40.999
knows that if they
need to be called out,

05:40.999 --> 05:44.999
I'm gonna do it,
and if your feelings get hurt,

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
I'm sorry.
Not really...

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
- Yeah.
- Because you screwed up.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
Deal with it, suck it up,
get on with your job.

05:51.999 --> 05:54.999
If you can't, then you really
don't need to be in yachting.

05:54.999 --> 05:57.999
I don't single out Kate
and Eddie and go,

05:57.999 --> 05:58.999
"Well, they're my team,
and I'm just gonna support them

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
no matter what,"
'cause that's bullsh**

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
'cause I'm not that way.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.999
- Well, in the midst
of all of the drama,

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
there was a bright spot
named Connie.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
Connie, you weren't big
on wearing clothes,

06:08.999 --> 06:11.999
but your work ethic
and your positive attitude

06:11.999 --> 06:15.999
helped you win the respect
of everybody on the boat.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
- This boat's headed off
to the Med.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
We were wondering if you would
consider hanging out with us

06:20.999 --> 06:23.999
a while after this present
Carribean season

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
comes to an end.

06:25.999 --> 06:26.999
- That would be amazing.

06:26.999 --> 06:27.999
- Connie, so did you end up

06:27.999 --> 06:28.999
going to work in the Med?

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
- I did.
- How was it?

06:30.999 --> 06:31.999
- It was the best experience
of my life.

06:31.999 --> 06:33.999
- Do you aspire
to be a captain one day?

06:33.999 --> 06:34.999
What's your goal?

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
- Um, I don't know so much
a captain.

06:36.999 --> 06:39.999
I mean, we've joked about
having a boat only girls working

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
called "Tutu Fun" and all
the girls have to wear tutus.

06:41.999 --> 06:42.999
We don't need--
sorry, no offense.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
We don't need any men onboard.

06:44.999 --> 06:47.999
And I think it's more
of a cute dream than anything,

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
but to continue working on boats

06:49.999 --> 06:52.999
is something I would
definitely enjoy.

06:52.999 --> 06:55.999
- How many people here
have seen Connie topless?

06:55.999 --> 06:56.999
- I felt them.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
Wait a minute.
Tell me, babe. Oh, sh**!

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
There's whipped cream
everywhere.

07:02.999 --> 07:04.999
- Any other foods
you can use as a bikini?

07:04.999 --> 07:07.999
- Oh, please. I can go all day.
- Give me some.

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
- Peanut butter stays on best.
- Okay.

07:09.999 --> 07:11.999
- Um, Nutella.
- Nutella.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.999
- It tastes good too, mm-hmm.
- Yeah, oh.

07:13.999 --> 07:16.999
This season, you got off
to a rough start.

07:16.999 --> 07:18.999
I mean, you--
you joined the boat and--

07:18.999 --> 07:23.999
and right then found out that
your father had passed away.

07:28.999 --> 07:32.999
- Last night, I wake up to a
text from my little brother,

07:32.999 --> 07:35.999
"Dad had a heart attack
and passed away."

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
Anytime that you
get news like that,

07:37.999 --> 07:38.999
and when you're in a place
where your phone doesn't work,

07:38.999 --> 07:40.999
and all you get
is a text message?

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
You read a text mes--
it happened to my grandma,

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
months later, while I
was still on the boat.

07:44.999 --> 07:47.999
In the middle of the ocean,
read my phone, "Your dad died."

07:47.999 --> 07:49.999
Six months later, "Your grandma
died," and I'm, like--

07:49.999 --> 07:51.999
I'm finding all this out
in text mesages,

07:51.999 --> 07:53.999
so it's like I'll sit there
and I'll be fine,

07:53.999 --> 07:55.999
and then I get home
and it's, like, reality.

07:55.999 --> 07:56.999
I can't pick up the phone
and call them.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.999
I have to see my brother
face-to-face.

07:58.999 --> 08:01.999
So it's like
you're not living in a re--

08:01.999 --> 08:03.000
in a realistic world
when you're on a yacht.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.999
- But you were very close
to your grandma, no?

08:05.999 --> 08:07.999
- Oh, my grandma?
Oh, that killed me.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.999
It's hard because you--
there's nothing you can do.

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
And I knew my whole family
was so upset at home,

08:11.999 --> 08:13.999
and I'm just like,
"I just need to keep working.

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
"And when I can get on
a damn plane,

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
I'm getting on
the first plane I see."

08:18.000 --> 08:19.999
- We all met
Connie's grandmother.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
She was the bomb.
- She's crazy.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
- Connie, how did it feel
when Rocky cock-blocked you,

08:23.999 --> 08:27.999
or should I say
clam-jammed you, from Emile...

08:27.999 --> 08:29.999
- Ugh!
- When you were out at the bar?

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
- I've got a really sore--
- Are you gonna get me

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
after I get you?
- Yeah, definitely.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
- Rocky's being a complete
tease with Emile.

08:36.999 --> 08:37.999
- You get enough attention.

08:37.999 --> 08:40.999
Do you really need
more attention?

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
Please, that was
not cock-blocking.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
I said the same thing
about Emile the whole time.

08:44.999 --> 08:47.999
Maybe when he's 30, he's gonna
be the most perfect guy.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.999
I think he's so handsome,
but it just is--

08:52.999 --> 08:53.999
when that stays shut,
I like it.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.999
- It seemed like your
relationship started

08:56.999 --> 08:57.999
a little flirty to me.
- No.

08:57.999 --> 08:59.000
- No?
- No!

08:59.999 --> 09:00.999
I thought he
was very good-looking.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
I admitted that.
I think--I still think

09:02.999 --> 09:03.999
he is very good-looking.

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
- Eddie,
who's the better deckie?

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
- Well, I mean,
they both had strengths

09:07.999 --> 09:10.999
that they were equally good at,
um, and together,

09:10.999 --> 09:12.999
I think they made
the perfect deckhand.

09:12.999 --> 09:14.999
- Jill from Wichita, Kansas,
said,

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
"I thought Connie and Rocky
were gonna be BFFs.

09:17.999 --> 09:20.999
"They're both surfer chicks,
and Rocky helped

09:20.999 --> 09:22.999
"make Connie's
whipped cream bikini.

09:22.999 --> 09:23.999
"But by the end of the season,

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
Connie couldn't stand Rocky.
What happened?"

09:25.999 --> 09:29.999
- Besides that, she is
so f***ing annoying to me.

09:29.999 --> 09:31.999
She drives me goddamn nuts.

09:31.999 --> 09:32.999
- I want to get
really weird tonight.

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
- She's like...

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
"What can I do
to call more attention?"

09:36.999 --> 09:37.999
- How many blow jobs
do you want?

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
- Like, I just can't
f***ing deal

09:39.999 --> 09:42.999
with her loud-ass mouth.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.999
To be honest, when Rocky and I
would be talking,

09:44.999 --> 09:45.999
like, alone in the crew mess,
I was like,

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
"Wow, this chick's
actually pretty cool.

09:47.999 --> 09:48.999
I feel like
we can get along."

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
And as soon as a camera
would come around,

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
she would literally turn into,
like, a theatrical lunatic.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.999
- I think I am a theatrical
lunatic all the time,

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
and I don't think it matters
if a camera is on or not.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
- No, we had plenty
of normal conversations.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
- But, uh, I honestly thought
we were friends the whole time,

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
so it kind of hurt me to watch

10:04.999 --> 10:06.999
and see you say
those things on TV.

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
- You heard me
in the crew mess numerous times.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.999
I would not hide that from you.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
- I just--I--I--
- And I wasn't hiding it.

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
- I really did think
we we're friends, so...

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
- I'm not saying--
- That was a shocker.

10:15.999 --> 10:16.999
- I'm not saying
we're not friends.

10:16.999 --> 10:18.999
You can have friends
that are annoying.

10:18.999 --> 10:19.999
There's just sometimes
you just need some space.

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
- You said, "I hate her,"
or something like that.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
- I--no, no, no.
I didn't hate you.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
"I can't stand you"
is a lot different than hating.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.999
Hate's a strong word.

10:27.999 --> 10:29.999
It's just "can't stand
being in the presence."

10:29.999 --> 10:32.999
Maybe off-camera, if we went
on a week vacation somewhere,

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
we might have, like,
an awesome time together

10:34.999 --> 10:35.999
because you have
no one to impress.

10:35.999 --> 10:37.999
- She's the one that put
peanut butter on her nipples.

10:37.999 --> 10:40.999
- Off-work!
You took your clothes off

10:40.999 --> 10:41.999
while we were on charter.
- Well, I actually took

10:41.999 --> 10:44.999
my clothes off
because the microphone,

10:44.999 --> 10:46.999
you guys said it cost $6,000,

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
so I couldn't jump off
the boat with my clothes on.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.999
I had to get it off.
So that was why--

10:50.999 --> 10:51.999
- Did you have to take
your clothes off?

10:51.999 --> 10:52.999
- That's what happened.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.999
- Rocky.
- Rock.

10:54.999 --> 10:57.999
Have a little more respect
for your job

10:57.999 --> 10:59.999
and for you than this.

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
She's gonna jump.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
- Yeah, she's jumping.

11:04.999 --> 11:07.999
- To be honest with you,
I haven't seen any real remorse

11:07.999 --> 11:09.999
out of anything that you pulled
so far this season...

11:09.999 --> 11:11.999
- Okay.
- To be honest.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
- Well, then okay, Captain Lee.
I don't know what to say.

11:14.999 --> 11:17.999
- What I wanted to see from you
is I wanted to see you own--

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
- What?
What do you want me to own?

11:19.999 --> 11:23.999
- Do you want me to finish
or do you want to interrupt me?

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
I don't care.
Either one's fine with me.

11:25.999 --> 11:27.000
- Okay, go ahead.
- I want you to own

11:27.999 --> 11:29.999
that diving off the boat
in the middle of a charter

11:29.999 --> 11:32.999
was the dumbest thing
you possibly could have done.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
You didn't own it
and you still don't.

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
I see somebody
that wasn't doing their job

11:36.999 --> 11:39.999
that I expected
them to do, period.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
I'm the only person
on that boat you have to please

11:41.999 --> 11:44.999
because I control
your future on that boat.

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
- Well said.

11:46.999 --> 11:47.999
When I jumped off the boat,
I really thought

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
I wasn't coming back,
and I thought

11:49.999 --> 11:51.999
I was gonna go with Chef Leon.

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
And then I came back,

11:52.999 --> 11:55.999
and I went and talked
to the captain

11:55.999 --> 11:57.999
and I thoroughly apologized.
I mean, I don't know--

11:57.999 --> 12:00.999
- I didn't--I didn't feel
you were sincere.

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
I still don't.
- I'm just saying, there was

12:02.999 --> 12:05.999
a lot of things going on.
The fire happened--

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
- It didn't just happen to you.
It happened to everybody

12:07.999 --> 12:08.999
on the boat.
- I understand that.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.999
- But the only one
making excuses here is you.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
And that's the point
I'm trying to make,

12:13.999 --> 12:14.999
is you don't own it.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
- I'm sorry.
- You made a mistake.

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
"I did it, I screwed up.
It's on me."

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
But no, you're making excuses.

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
"I had a lot on my mind,
I had this, I had that."

12:23.999 --> 12:24.999
I don't care.

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
- Okay, are you gonna hold on
to this

12:28.999 --> 12:29.999
for the rest of your life?

12:33.999 --> 12:37.999
- So, Ben and Kate, is there
any chance that tonight,

12:37.999 --> 12:39.999
the two of you
will wind up together?

12:39.999 --> 12:45.999
- What are you doing later,
babes?

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
The fire happened,
Leon left--

12:49.999 --> 12:51.999
- It didn't just happen to you.
It happened to everybody

12:51.999 --> 12:53.999
on the boat.
- I understand that.

12:53.999 --> 12:54.999
I'm sorry.
- You made a mistake.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
Okay, "I did it, I screwed up.

12:56.999 --> 12:59.999
It's on me."
But no, you're making excuses.

12:59.999 --> 13:01.999
"I had a lot on my mind,
I had this, I had that."

13:01.999 --> 13:02.999
I don't care.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
- You know, looking back now,

13:04.999 --> 13:05.999
I've learned so much.

13:05.999 --> 13:07.999
And, Kate, you and Amy,
I wish--

13:07.999 --> 13:10.999
you guys should have gotten
a stew that had more experience.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.999
It would have made
your job a lot easier.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
But, um, you guys got me,

13:14.999 --> 13:16.999
and I just want to apologize.

13:16.999 --> 13:19.999
I'm sorry.
Like, I think I was just, like,

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
overwhelmed with
this whole job really.

13:21.999 --> 13:24.999
Like, what? It was crazy.
- Here's the thing, Rocky.

13:24.999 --> 13:25.999
Like, you brought
a lot to the table

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
that wasn't easily shown

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
because it's your personality.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.999
You brought a lot of excitement
and postivity to it.

13:32.999 --> 13:33.999
Yes, sometimes it was
frustrating trying to teach her,

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
like, I mean, you saw,
but you brought a lot.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.999
And so I loved the energy you
brought and I appreciate that.

13:38.999 --> 13:41.999
- Yeah, I don't want to not
get along with you.

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
I think you're a very cool,
talented girl.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
And I think
that was most frustrating

13:45.999 --> 13:48.999
because you made me laugh
when you were singing,

13:48.999 --> 13:51.999
and I can tell you're
really funny and vivacious.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.999
And I didn't want you
to not be on my side.

13:54.999 --> 13:57.999
It doesn't help me
to have you not on my side.

13:57.999 --> 14:01.999
- Do you accept her apology?
- Absolutely. And--

14:01.999 --> 14:02.999
- I'm gonna give you a hug.
- Yay!

14:02.999 --> 14:04.999
- Oh.
- And she's not gonna hug her.

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
- And if you wanted
these stewardess sheets,

14:06.999 --> 14:08.999
I'll email them to you.
- Oh, a stewardess--

14:08.999 --> 14:10.999
- For a checklist,
and it'll just help you.

14:10.999 --> 14:12.999
- So you're saying
she's ready for the list?

14:12.999 --> 14:14.999
Is this official?

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
I mean, I'll give you
the list, yeah.

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
- I would--I would love a list!

14:18.999 --> 14:19.999
- That's cute.
- 'Cause then I know what to do.

14:19.999 --> 14:20.999
- That is cute.
- Yeah.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.999
- Eddie, are you buying this?

14:22.999 --> 14:23.999
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
- Okay, let's switch gears
for a second.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.000
The day that Leon was let go
was by far the craziest day.

14:29.999 --> 14:30.999
You have a 2:00 a.m. fire.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
- What is going on?

14:32.999 --> 14:34.999
- Then you lose your chef.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.999
- I don't see the situation
getting any better.

14:37.999 --> 14:40.999
- Your third stew strips
and jumps ship.

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
And then you still have
to pull off

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
the most important event
of the charter,

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
the 50th birthday party.

14:46.999 --> 14:47.999
- Happy Birthday, Mr. Miller.

14:47.999 --> 14:51.999
Cheers.

14:51.999 --> 14:52.999
- The man had never gotten
a birthday cake.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
It was a big night.

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
- And it was a late checkout.
- Ugh!

14:56.999 --> 14:57.999
- Had you ever had
a tougher day?

14:57.999 --> 15:00.000
- Never in my--
- The most insane day

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
I've ever had in yachting.
- It's like a blur.

15:01.999 --> 15:04.999
- The silver lining to that
charter day from hell

15:04.999 --> 15:08.999
is that Chef Ben
was able to fly in

15:08.999 --> 15:12.999
like a yacht-y superhero
and save the day.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
- Hello, love.

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
- Well, it took you
long enough.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
- I know.
It's a long swim.

15:16.999 --> 15:17.999
- You come to save us?

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
- I don't know
what I'm here for.

15:19.999 --> 15:20.999
- It's beautiful.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
- Chef Leon's got f***-all
on that.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.999
- Great to see you.
- Captain.

15:26.999 --> 15:27.999
Everyone.

15:27.999 --> 15:29.999
- How are you?
- Andy.

15:29.999 --> 15:30.999
Very well, thank you.
- How did it feel to get the--

15:30.999 --> 15:33.999
how did it feel to get
the call from Captain Lee to--

15:33.999 --> 15:34.999
- It was great.

15:34.999 --> 15:35.999
It was amazing.
Thank you.

15:35.999 --> 15:37.999
Thank you.

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
- An unexpected surprise.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
- Now that you've seen
the episodes,

15:41.999 --> 15:42.999
what did you think of Chef Leon?

15:42.999 --> 15:45.999
- I do think that,
as a yacht chef,

15:45.999 --> 15:49.999
it's our duty to follow
a preference sheet--

15:49.999 --> 15:53.999
all of the guests'
preferred food types.

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
As the yacht chef,
we create that.

15:55.999 --> 15:58.999
Um, I think it's a bit
of a cop-out, to be honest,

15:58.999 --> 15:59.999
to do beef cheeks
for every guest.

15:59.999 --> 16:03.999
I mean, I don't--
I doubt that there was one guest

16:03.999 --> 16:05.999
that had that
on their preference sheet.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.999
And also the galley
was a disgrace as well.

16:08.999 --> 16:11.999
I got to say that.
I'm sorry, but it was.

16:11.999 --> 16:12.999
If the health department
had gone in there,

16:12.999 --> 16:15.999
they would have shut it down.

16:15.999 --> 16:18.999
- Um, Rocky, I'm wondering
if you were predisposed

16:18.999 --> 16:21.999
to dislike Ben because he was
replacing your friend.

16:21.999 --> 16:24.999
- I--well, actually,
Kate had told me earlier

16:24.999 --> 16:28.000
that season that her and Ben
had a relationship.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
And I was like, "Oh, perfect.

16:30.999 --> 16:32.999
This is great. Kate hates me."

16:32.999 --> 16:35.999
Chef Leon's left and then,
Ben, her boyfriend's coming,

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
and that was, like,
my first instinct like,

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
"This is great.
This is gonna be great."

16:39.999 --> 16:42.999
But then I met him
and he's great, he's awesome.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
- You know, Rocky literally
became your left hand

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
when you cut yours.
- I know.

16:46.999 --> 16:47.999
A crispy quail.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.000
Ow!

16:50.999 --> 16:51.999
f*** you!
- You okay?

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
- No, I'm not okay.
I think that you're

16:53.999 --> 16:57.999
really gonna need
to be my left arm.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
Go slowly, baby.
Take your time.

16:59.999 --> 17:00.999
Make really nice thin cuts,
please.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.999
- You think Rocky
has what it takes?

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
- I do actually.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
She's got really strong hands.

17:06.999 --> 17:09.000
She was just very coordinated.

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
I don't know exactly how
creative or skillful you are,

17:11.999 --> 17:13.999
but I think you can get there.

17:13.999 --> 17:14.999
- Thank you.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
- Kim from Charleston,
South Carolina, said,

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
"You'd think Kate would be happy
to have Ben back on the boat,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.999
"but she starts fighting
with him almost immediately.

17:21.999 --> 17:26.999
Does Kate get along
with anybody?"

17:26.999 --> 17:27.999
- Uh-uh.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
You were picking fights.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
Should I tell the guests
to chew faster?

17:31.999 --> 17:34.999
- It's all part
of the same buffet, love.

17:34.999 --> 17:36.999
We're not doing
a coursed buffet.

17:36.999 --> 17:38.999
- I'm taking it.
- f***ing hell.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
She's being really
f***ing difficult tonight.

17:40.999 --> 17:41.999
- Like can you two just

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
go downstairs and take care
of this, please.

17:43.999 --> 17:47.999
Because you can cut the tension
with a butter knife.

17:47.999 --> 17:50.000
And I mean, we're talking
about the sexual tension here.

17:50.999 --> 17:51.999
- Oh, God!

17:51.999 --> 17:54.999
I think you may have been
a little tired, honey bunny.

17:59.999 --> 18:00.999
You know--

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
- Even when Ben and I fight,

18:02.999 --> 18:05.999
it's more for fun
and--witty banter, yeah.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
It's not an actual
not getting along.

18:07.999 --> 18:08.999
- And it's the position,
you know,

18:08.999 --> 18:10.999
the chief stew and chef are
always gonna butt heads.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
- Yeah.
- But hopefully at the end

18:12.999 --> 18:13.999
of the day we can
put it behind us

18:13.999 --> 18:15.999
and start a brand
new day tomorrow.

18:15.999 --> 18:17.999
And, you know,
that's kind of how we roll.

18:17.999 --> 18:18.999
- Breakfast.
- Yeah.

18:18.999 --> 18:19.999
- So Ben and Kate...
- I love breakfast.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.999
- Your fave.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.999
- By your own admission,

18:22.999 --> 18:23.999
you two did have a fling

18:23.999 --> 18:27.999
after you left "Ohana"
in season two.

18:27.999 --> 18:29.999
How long did that last?
- Well...

18:29.999 --> 18:30.999
- Nothing.
It was like--

18:30.999 --> 18:31.999
- Yeah.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
- Over a year ago.
- 30 seconds?

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- He's such a bragger.

18:40.999 --> 18:42.999
- I mean, was it like a week?

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
Was it a few times?

18:43.999 --> 18:44.999
Was it friends with benefits?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
- I'm not impressed with that.
- I'm kidding.

18:46.999 --> 18:47.999
- It was like,
you have some cocktails,

18:47.999 --> 18:49.999
you make a bad decision.
That's all it ever was.

18:49.999 --> 18:51.999
- So it wasn't a relationship?

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
- No.
- It was a fling?

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
- Well, we were just really--
we were just great friends.

18:56.999 --> 18:59.999
- It was convenient at the time,
and we checked that box.

18:59.999 --> 19:02.999
- Yeah, done, tick.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.999
- Were you hoping
to rekindle things with Ben?

19:06.999 --> 19:09.000
- No, but it was
just such a relief to have

19:09.000 --> 19:14.999
somebody in the galley
that wasn't dark and miserable.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
- I think we're much better off
as friends, I mean--

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
Even as friends we get into it.
- Yeah.

19:18.999 --> 19:19.999
We're not even--yeah, we're not
even that good of friends.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.999
- That's what's good sometimes.
- Even as friends

19:21.999 --> 19:24.000
and colleagues, we get into it.
- That doesn't work really.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.999
- Kate, do you have a--do you
have a boyfriend right now?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
- I mean, my dance
card stays full,

19:28.999 --> 19:30.000
but nothing I'm committing too.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.999
- All right, there you go.
- It's a sin.

19:31.999 --> 19:32.999
- I like that.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.999
- Um, Ben, do you have
a girlfriend?

19:34.999 --> 19:36.999
- Nope.
- No?

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
- You're both kind of
single and available.

19:38.999 --> 19:39.999
- Kind of, yeah.

19:39.999 --> 19:41.999
- Is there any chance
that tonight

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
the two of you will
wind up together?

19:43.999 --> 19:44.999
- Wow.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.999
- Depends on how much
they drink.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
- I would still say no--
- I'm just kidding, okay.

19:48.999 --> 19:49.999
- 'Cause--
- Where are you going?

19:49.999 --> 19:51.999
- I'm staying in Miami,
you're going to Lauderdale.

19:51.999 --> 19:54.000
- What are you doing?
- It's geographical.

19:54.999 --> 19:55.999
- What are you doing later,
babe?

19:58.999 --> 19:59.999
- Coming up...

19:59.999 --> 20:00.999
So did you cut
things off then?

20:00.999 --> 20:01.999
- I definitely didn't have

20:01.999 --> 20:03.999
any sexual interaction
with her anymore.

20:03.999 --> 20:05.999
- What about two times
after the show?

20:12.999 --> 20:13.999
during the charter season,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.999
Captain Lee called
on the hardworking

20:16.999 --> 20:21.999
and drama-free Dave Bradberry
to complete his crew.

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
Dave's here too.

20:24.999 --> 20:25.999
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dave.

20:25.999 --> 20:27.999
- Oh, hey.
- Thank you for having me.

20:27.999 --> 20:29.999
Permission to come aboard?

20:30.999 --> 20:33.999
- What's going on, brother?

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
Ah, look at you.
- How's it going, brother?

20:35.999 --> 20:36.999
- It's good to see you.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
- I really appreciate you
coming back

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
and bailing my ass out.
- Any time, Captain.

20:40.999 --> 20:43.999
- Dave, how did it feel to get
the call from Captain Lee?

20:43.999 --> 20:46.999
- I felt that
it was long overdue.

20:46.999 --> 20:47.999
I was happy to be back.

20:47.999 --> 20:48.999
It was a little bit of surprise,

20:48.999 --> 20:49.999
but I'm always ready to

20:49.999 --> 20:52.999
head back out on the ocean.

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
- Dave, what were your first
impressions of the crew?

20:54.999 --> 20:55.999
- I was kind of
ready for anything.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
You know, the--
it seemed like there was

20:57.999 --> 20:59.999
a motley crew of
big personalities.

20:59.999 --> 21:01.999
So I was really excited
to get to know everybody.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.999
- Emile, you and Dave
bunked together.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
- Oh, yeah.
- Was this the first time you

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
shared a room with
a gay crew member?

21:07.999 --> 21:08.999
- Homosexual.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
- Uh, it was really pleasant.

21:10.999 --> 21:13.999
Very neat guy,
very nice guy, is--

21:13.999 --> 21:16.999
all-around, yeah, good guy.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
- Connie, what was your
first impression of Dave?

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
- I was excited to have
any type of break

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
that I could from
Emile at this point,

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
towards the end of the season.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
- Okay, let's switch gears
for a second.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
Rocky, when you were
hired as third stew,

21:30.999 --> 21:31.999
you were told that
you would spend

21:31.999 --> 21:33.999
a lot of time
in the laundry room.

21:33.999 --> 21:35.999
But I don't know that

21:35.999 --> 21:38.999
anyone expected you
to be spending your time

21:38.999 --> 21:41.999
with anyone else
in the laundry room.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.999
You and Eddie kind of gave
new meaning to the term

21:44.999 --> 21:46.999
"dirty laundry."

21:49.000 --> 21:50.999
- "Pay attention, girl!

21:50.999 --> 21:53.000
"Stop going to sleep
so early on slow days

21:53.000 --> 21:57.999
and you might
get some stress relieved."

21:57.999 --> 22:01.000
Eduardo says yes.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.999
- Eduardo loves the ladies.
- Ow.

22:07.999 --> 22:11.999
- You fought over who
started your affair.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.000
Once and for all,

22:13.999 --> 22:14.999
I mean, who flirted first?

22:14.999 --> 22:16.999
- Do you want to take
the lead on this?

22:16.999 --> 22:18.999
- I mean, I--

22:18.999 --> 22:22.999
I would never have said anything
or started anything

22:22.999 --> 22:25.999
if Rocky hadn't started
flirting with me first.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
- Who sent the first text?

22:27.999 --> 22:28.999
- That was probably me
that sent the first text.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.999
But things happened before that.

22:30.999 --> 22:32.999
- What happened before that?

22:32.999 --> 22:35.999
- Rocky put herself
out there pretty obviously.

22:35.999 --> 22:37.999
- How does that manifest itself?

22:37.999 --> 22:38.999
- Well, I don't think
I would've sent

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
a text message saying,
"You know,

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
if you want
some stress relieved."

22:42.999 --> 22:45.999
Obviously she'd should come
to me prior and was like,

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
"I need some stress relieved."

22:47.999 --> 22:50.999
And then I, you know,
followed suit.

22:50.999 --> 22:53.999
- Okay.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.000
Hi.

22:55.999 --> 22:56.999
Eddie was really cute

22:56.999 --> 22:58.999
and he was
the only guy that was--

22:58.999 --> 22:59.999
just caught my eye.

22:59.999 --> 23:02.999
And he's handsome and funny
and charming and great.

23:02.999 --> 23:05.999
And then--I asked him,
I was like,

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
"Oh, he had a girlfriend,
okay, cool."

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
But, in the back of my mind,
we're on a yacht.

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
We're stuck with each other.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
After a while,
you get to know people,

23:13.999 --> 23:17.999
and Eddie, you know,
we'd start kind of

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
like eyeballing
each other up and down.

23:19.999 --> 23:20.999
- Wow, I was like who the f***

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
is this girl in here
for a second.

23:22.999 --> 23:24.999
- Why?
- You got straight hair.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
- Well?

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
- Well, what?

23:27.999 --> 23:30.999
Jerk.

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
- That's really good.

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
I like that.
- Oh, thanks, bud.

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
You so sexy, baby.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.999
Oh, my God!

23:37.999 --> 23:40.999
Then it kind of got into
sneaky little butt grabs

23:40.999 --> 23:43.999
and then kind of, like,
short, little kisses

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
here and there
when no one's looking,

23:45.999 --> 23:47.999
and then, yeah, that's
kind of what happened.

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
That's how it started.

23:48.999 --> 23:49.999
- That's exciting.
- Yeah, it was.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
- I-I mean, I don't know.

23:51.999 --> 23:54.999
Like I don't think it really
happened exactly like that.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
I definitely think there
was a lot of flirting

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
going on between us,
which, you know,

23:57.999 --> 24:01.999
led to some trips
to the laundry room.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
I'm trying to sleep.
- That's why it's a quickie.

24:09.999 --> 24:12.999
It's an in-out kind of thing.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.999
I wouldn't call it
a "relationship,"

24:14.999 --> 24:17.999
but yeah, of course, I mean,
I-I don't deny what happened.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.999
I-I take full responsibility
for it.

24:19.999 --> 24:20.999
- What would you call it, Eddie?

24:20.999 --> 24:23.999
- I would call it doing
some dirty laundry.

24:23.999 --> 24:24.999
I'd call it a fling.

24:24.999 --> 24:25.999
I would call it
friends with benefits.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
- Would you characterize
it the same way?

24:27.999 --> 24:29.999
Was there emotion for you?

24:29.999 --> 24:31.999
- I would just say that,

24:31.999 --> 24:35.999
you know it's hard to...

24:35.999 --> 24:37.999
Be friends with benefits.

24:37.999 --> 24:40.999
Usually friends with benefits
act like friends.

24:40.999 --> 24:41.999
- Did you really think that
you were gonna be able to

24:41.999 --> 24:43.999
keep this thing a secret?

24:43.999 --> 24:45.999
- Yeah.
- Eddie, yeah?

24:45.999 --> 24:47.999
- Yeah.
- Did anyone here suspect

24:47.999 --> 24:50.999
that this was happening
between these two?

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
No one suspected.

24:52.999 --> 24:56.999
So, Amy, why were you so upset
that Rocky confided in Emile?

24:56.999 --> 25:00.999
- Eddie and I,
we had like

25:00.999 --> 25:04.999
a little thing going on
the whole time.

25:04.999 --> 25:07.999
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, is that crazy or what?

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
- That is hilarious.

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
- Yeah.
- That is so funny.

25:13.999 --> 25:16.999
That's the only thing.

25:16.999 --> 25:18.000
- Oh, not upset, but it's like,

25:18.999 --> 25:19.999
what did you want
to gain from that?

25:19.999 --> 25:20.999
It didn't make sense to me.

25:20.999 --> 25:22.999
If you've kept it
a secret this entire time,

25:22.999 --> 25:25.999
then what did you want
to get from telling Emile?

25:25.999 --> 25:28.999
- I really honestly felt
that, after our date,

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
Emile and I were friends

25:30.999 --> 25:32.999
and I felt like I could
count on him for everything

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
and I think him and I
also do have, like,

25:34.999 --> 25:37.000
a fun, flirty relationship,
but he's not into me.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
And I'm not into him,
but we're like hey, hey, hey.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
- Well, that being said,
Emile kind of freaked

25:41.999 --> 25:42.999
when he heard the news.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
- He was funny.
- It seemed like

25:44.999 --> 25:45.999
your reaction to finding out

25:45.999 --> 25:48.999
about the Eddie-Rocky fling
was so intense

25:48.999 --> 25:51.999
because maybe you still had
a little bit of a crush on her.

25:51.999 --> 25:54.999
- It was just--
it was just like, oh, wow.

25:54.999 --> 25:55.999
I never knew that happened.

25:55.999 --> 25:57.999
Like it was--
it was more like,

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
it was ironic.
It was like--

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
- Was there a part of you
that was jealous?

26:01.999 --> 26:05.999
- No, I was--I would just say--
I'd say disappointed.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.000
- Disappointed why?
- I don't know.

26:07.999 --> 26:08.999
It's just basically--

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
It's not a very
truthful situation,

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
using me to tell it to.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
Like, why would you come to me?
Like, why?

26:14.999 --> 26:15.999
- 'Cause you were my only friend

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
on the boat that
I actually got along with.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
- But you like kept pushing.
It was like a knife

26:19.999 --> 26:20.999
and you kept like twisting.

26:20.999 --> 26:22.999
And then, it was here
and you're laughing.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.999
"Can I get a high five?"
That was like--

26:24.999 --> 26:26.999
- Yeah, that's just--
that's not cool, that--

26:26.999 --> 26:27.999
- That was like
the last person to tell it to

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
'cause you knew that
he was gonna like--

26:29.999 --> 26:30.999
they worked so closely together.

26:30.999 --> 26:31.999
And it was tension.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
- Well, I felt
the conversation--

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
I had to tell somebody,
and so I felt like

26:35.999 --> 26:37.999
he was the one person
that I could've gone to.

26:37.999 --> 26:40.999
- Ben, what was
your reaction to him?

26:40.999 --> 26:42.999
- Well,
you know, I just kind

26:42.999 --> 26:44.999
of got on the boat and--

26:44.999 --> 26:45.999
I don't know, I think
that everyone was kind of

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
skeptical of the story
to begin with.

26:47.999 --> 26:49.999
- Yes.
- We thought that maybe

26:49.999 --> 26:50.999
Rocky was making it up.

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
So I kind of wanted to get
to the bottom of it,

26:52.999 --> 26:55.999
but, I mean,
my loyalty is with--

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
was with Eddie, you know,

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
'cause I've known him
for many years.

26:59.999 --> 27:01.999
I'm kind of proud of you
actually to be honest.

27:01.999 --> 27:02.999
You know?

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
- Why are you proud of him?

27:04.999 --> 27:06.999
For pulling it off?

27:06.999 --> 27:08.999
- He was sneaky.

27:08.999 --> 27:09.999
- You were quite sneaky

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
about hooking up with Kat...

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
- Yes.
- Uh, season one.

27:13.999 --> 27:14.999
- Yes.
- So maybe you were glad

27:14.999 --> 27:17.999
that someone else was
pulling it off.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
- You know what, yeah.

27:19.999 --> 27:22.999
We're just guys, you know,
and we're gonna screw up.

27:22.999 --> 27:25.000
Girls screw up as well and,
you know, it's all part of it.

27:25.999 --> 27:28.999
And yachting is
a very concentrated environment.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
And you know,
there's gonna be sex.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
In this case,
it was these two.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
- Was it more to you?

27:34.999 --> 27:36.999
- Um, I would just definitely
say that I really did like Eddie

27:36.999 --> 27:39.999
and I thought he was
a really good guy and--

27:39.999 --> 27:43.999
- Did you think that when
the charter season was over

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
you would continue with him?

27:45.999 --> 27:50.999
- Um, not after the way
that I saw how he...

27:51.999 --> 27:54.999
was talking poorly about me
to the other cast members.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
It just really hurt my feelings.

27:55.999 --> 27:56.999
- Connie, when Emile told you

27:56.999 --> 27:58.999
that Rocky and Eddie
had been hooking up,

27:58.999 --> 28:00.999
you didn't believe it at all.

28:00.999 --> 28:03.999
- Apparently, Eddie and Rocky
have been hooking up.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.999
- No, they haven't been.

28:05.999 --> 28:09.000
- They've been f***ing.
That's what she says.

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
- Eddie would not do that.
Eddie cannot stand her.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
Eddie has a girlfriend
that he's extremely into.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
I don't believe it at all.

28:15.999 --> 28:16.999
- Why were you so sure that

28:16.999 --> 28:18.999
nothing was happening
between them?

28:18.999 --> 28:19.999
- Well, of course when
we're on deck,

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
we talk a little bit.
And I don't know

28:21.999 --> 28:24.999
that I heard too many
positive things

28:24.999 --> 28:27.999
come out of any of the decks'
mouth about Rocky,

28:27.999 --> 28:28.999
besides she's
a freaking cuckoo bird.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.999
So why would I think
that my boss

28:30.999 --> 28:32.000
would want
to bang a cuckoo bird?

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
No offense,

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
but I don't know
how else to put it.

28:34.999 --> 28:36.999
Like if you're gonna bang
someone,

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
it's usually like,
"Oh, man, did you see Rocky?

28:38.999 --> 28:39.999
Did you see her do that dive?
That was hot,"

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
but there was nothing of that.

28:41.999 --> 28:43.999
- Mona from New Haven,
Connecticut, said,

28:43.999 --> 28:45.999
"Eddie, once might be a slip up,

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
"but you had sex
with Rocky four times.

28:47.999 --> 28:50.999
How could you ghost her
on the boat after that?"

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
- Need some strips.

29:01.999 --> 29:02.999
- Are you okay?

29:02.999 --> 29:03.999
- Am I okay?

29:03.999 --> 29:04.999
- Yeah.

29:04.999 --> 29:08.999
- I'm fine.

29:08.999 --> 29:09.999
I don't think
I was ignoring her.

29:09.999 --> 29:15.999
I just was not really open to
any more sexual advances.

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
You can't ignore anybody
on a boat that size.

29:17.999 --> 29:20.999
- I think he was worried that
everyone was going to find out,

29:20.999 --> 29:21.999
so he tried to make it seem

29:21.999 --> 29:24.999
that there was no way
that we had a relationship.

29:24.999 --> 29:27.999
So he was trying to
further himself from me.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
That's how I--
that's how I looked at it.

29:29.999 --> 29:30.999
- Well, I think it was that,
but it was also, you know,

29:30.999 --> 29:34.999
like I was starting to try to

29:34.999 --> 29:36.999
work things out with my
girlfriend again at the time.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
And there's that,

29:38.999 --> 29:41.999
along with Rocky's
professionalism, and everything.

29:41.999 --> 29:44.999
And I just kind of felt
like distancing myself

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
would be the best--
the best--

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
- The professionalism thing
is a big thing for you, right?

29:48.999 --> 29:51.999
- Yeah, and, I mean, that--
and that's also a part of

29:51.999 --> 29:53.999
why I tried distancing myself.
It's because I realized

29:53.999 --> 29:54.999
how unprofessional I was being

29:54.999 --> 29:58.999
and how I was going against
my rules and my morals.

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
And--and I was
ashamed of myself for,

30:01.999 --> 30:03.999
for breaking those rules and--

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
and you know,
being so unprofessional.

30:05.999 --> 30:09.999
- I didn't know that he didn't
like me like that.

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
- What's your reaction to that?

30:11.999 --> 30:12.999
- I'm sorry that
you felt that way.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
I thought--I thought
that was pretty obvious.

30:14.999 --> 30:15.999
- That you hated my guts?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.999
- I don't think
I hated your guts,

30:17.999 --> 30:20.999
but after when Leon
got let go,

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
you just went off the deep end
and ripped all your clothes off

30:22.999 --> 30:24.000
and dove off the boat.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.999
It was just kind of, like,
holy s***, this girl is nuts.

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
Like what is she doing?
You should have been fired.

30:29.999 --> 30:30.999
You should have
never been back there.

30:30.999 --> 30:32.999
And I had--I--you know,
I had enough of it.

30:32.999 --> 30:33.999
- That was when it
all changed for you?

30:33.999 --> 30:34.999
- Yeah.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.999
- So did you cut
things off then?

30:36.999 --> 30:38.999
- I wouldn't say cut things off,
but I definitely didn't

30:38.999 --> 30:41.999
go in the laundry room.
I didn't, like have any kind of

30:41.999 --> 30:42.999
sexual interaction
with her anymore.

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- You didn't?
- No.

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- So that was the last time
that we hooked up?

30:46.999 --> 30:47.999
- Yeah.

30:47.999 --> 30:50.999
- What about two times
after the show?

30:50.999 --> 30:51.999
- Ooh!

30:51.999 --> 30:55.999
- Whoa.

30:55.999 --> 30:57.999
- Okay.

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
- Coming up...

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
- He came to my hotel room.
"Bomp, bom, bom."

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
We're not in the laundry room
anymore.

31:05.999 --> 31:08.999
And then how about
at pickup interview?

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
Ha!

31:14.999 --> 31:15.999
you might be
a woman after my heart.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.999
You wrote "Housewives" taglines

31:18.999 --> 31:21.999
for each of the crew
from "Below Deck."

31:21.999 --> 31:23.999
Ben--"A flash in
the pan isn't my style.

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
I prefer to stir the pot."

31:25.999 --> 31:27.000
Give Amy hers.

31:27.999 --> 31:28.999
- "You know what they say.

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
'The grass is always greener

31:30.999 --> 31:31.999
'on the bright side."

31:31.999 --> 31:32.999
Hey, y'all."
- Rocky?

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
- "I was a champion diver,

31:34.999 --> 31:35.999
"so I'm always
looking for reasons

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
to go off the deep end."

31:37.999 --> 31:38.999
- "I may not know everything,

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
"but I know I'm good-looking,

31:39.999 --> 31:41.999
and that's what really matters."

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
- "I've got a pocketful
of plane tickets

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
and I'm not afraid
to use them."

31:45.999 --> 31:46.999
- "I may have
a bitchy resting face,

31:46.999 --> 31:48.999
"but that's the only part of me

31:48.999 --> 31:49.999
that's ever resting."

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
- "It's what's on
the inside that counts,

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
"so on the outside,

31:52.999 --> 31:53.999
why wear anything at all?"

31:53.999 --> 31:54.999
- "Work in the water can
get hard at times,

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
"so when my vessel gets Rocky,

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
any port in a storm will do."

31:58.999 --> 32:00.000
A little play on words.
- That's a pun.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
- Dave.
"I'm here for a good time,

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
not a long time."

32:03.999 --> 32:06.999
Leon--"Tonight,
I'm serving beef cheeks."

32:13.999 --> 32:14.999
- I wouldn't say cut things off,

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
but I definitely didn't go
in the laundry room.

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
I didn't, like, have
any kind of

32:18.999 --> 32:19.999
sexual interaction
with her anymore.

32:19.999 --> 32:20.999
- You didn't?
- No.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.999
- So that was the last time
that we hooked up?

32:23.999 --> 32:24.999
- Yeah.

32:24.999 --> 32:27.999
- What about two times
after the show?

32:27.999 --> 32:28.999
- Oh!

32:28.999 --> 32:32.999
- Whoa.

32:32.999 --> 32:33.999
- Okay.

32:33.999 --> 32:36.999
- What about the night
after filming?

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
And he came to my--

32:38.999 --> 32:41.999
he came to my hotel room,
"Bum, bum, bum."

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
We're not in
the laundry room anymore.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.999
And then, how about
at pickup interview?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Ha!

32:48.000 --> 32:49.999
- You could say what you want.

32:49.999 --> 32:50.999
- Airing that dirty laundry.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
- Why, oh, are you denying that?
- Yes.

32:52.999 --> 32:54.999
- You're denying that?
- Yes.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.999
- I mean, why would I lie?
What would I have to lie about?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.999
- Well, let me ask you this.

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
You may have something
to lie about.

33:00.999 --> 33:02.999
You're back with
your girlfriend.

33:02.999 --> 33:04.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, we've got back together.

33:04.999 --> 33:07.999
- So what will her reaction be

33:07.999 --> 33:10.000
when she sees
this accusation?

33:10.999 --> 33:11.999
- I don't know.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
- Was the sex great?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.999
- Well, it didn't happen once.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
- Too quick to really tell.

33:18.999 --> 33:22.999
- Not the time after the show
or not the two times after.

33:22.999 --> 33:23.999
That was pretty good.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.999
Why you keep saying that?

33:28.999 --> 33:30.999
- You're denying that
it happened after the show.

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
- Yes, I absolutely am denying
that's happened, yeah.

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
- You weren't together
with your girlfriend.

33:34.999 --> 33:35.999
- No, I wasn't together
with my girlfriend.

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999
- No, you weren't together
with your girlfriend.

33:37.999 --> 33:38.999
You guys broke up.
- Yeah.

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
- So the show was over.
We were done filming.

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
And it's like, "Hey, finally,

33:42.999 --> 33:44.999
you know, we don't have to do it
in the laundry room."

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
- When did you get back together
with your girlfriend?

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
- Uh, I guess it was like

33:48.999 --> 33:51.000
almost a month after I got
back from the show.

33:51.999 --> 33:52.999
- Eddie, how did you feel

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
watching the scenes
where you're--

33:54.999 --> 33:56.999
- Lying.
- Lying to the crew?

33:56.999 --> 33:57.999
- So, how's Amy?

33:57.999 --> 33:58.999
- It's really hard.

33:58.999 --> 34:00.999
- She's just lonely?

34:00.999 --> 34:02.999
- And she knows, like,
I would never, never ever

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
hook up with anybody on the boat
that I work on ever.

34:04.999 --> 34:07.999
Here's to a long,
happy relationship.

34:07.999 --> 34:10.999
- Rocky is kind of like
talking about some things.

34:10.999 --> 34:13.999
- Like what?
- Like y'all hooking up.

34:13.999 --> 34:15.999
- Why the f*** would
she say that s***?

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
You're saying that
something happened between us?

34:19.999 --> 34:21.999
- I mean, nothing ever happened,

34:21.999 --> 34:23.999
so I don't know
why you would say it.

34:23.999 --> 34:25.999
- Yeah, really.

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
Dude, nothing ever happened.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
Embarassed.
I mean, I consider,

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
you know, almost everyone
here a good friend.

34:31.999 --> 34:36.999
And I'm so ashamed for lying

34:36.999 --> 34:37.999
and I wish I could apologize,

34:37.999 --> 34:39.999
but really
the only thing I could do

34:39.999 --> 34:41.999
is just try to move forward.

34:41.999 --> 34:43.999
- Dave, I wonder what
was your reaction when

34:43.999 --> 34:45.999
your buddy Eddie
looked you in the eye,

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
and said he didn't have
an affair with Rocky.

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
- I was surprised.
I wouldn't say that Eddie lied.

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
I-I don't think that

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
he actually told me
anything that was

34:54.999 --> 34:56.999
other than the truth,
but I was shocked.

34:56.999 --> 34:59.999
- Captain Lee is kind of
rolling his eyes a little bit.

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
- Yeah.
No offense, David.

35:01.999 --> 35:04.999
But not telling
the truth is a lie.

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
- Were you disappointed
in Eddie?

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
- Extremely disappointed
in Eddie.

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
And Eddie and I have
had the discussion.

35:10.999 --> 35:11.999
Don't mind telling you
I'm disappointed.

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
It was just a colossal f*** up.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
- Yeah, colossal.
- And I'm not gonna

35:15.999 --> 35:18.999
sugarcoat it for your ass.
I expected more.

35:18.999 --> 35:20.999
You only have
one shot at integrity.

35:20.999 --> 35:23.999
There's not a lot of
gray area there, period.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
- Were you disappointed
that he fooled around with Rocky

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
or that he lied about it?
- Both.

35:27.999 --> 35:30.999
No, I don't understand
why he would it.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.999
And I understand even less
the attempt at the cover-up.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.999
- Kate, what was your reaction
to Eddie denying it?

35:36.999 --> 35:37.999
Did your heart go out to Rocky?

35:37.999 --> 35:39.999
- Actually,
watching the final episode,

35:39.999 --> 35:42.999
I felt very bad for you,

35:42.999 --> 35:44.999
because I could see
how it was misleading.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.999
And I can see
your position as well.

35:47.999 --> 35:50.999
And we've all been there.
It's just not easy.

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
- Dan from New York City said,
"Why is Rocky being blamed

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
"for Emile following her around
like a puppy dog,

35:56.000 --> 35:57.999
"Don following her
into the water,

35:57.999 --> 36:00.000
"or Eddie cheating on
his girlfriend with her?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.999
"Those guys made their choices.

36:02.999 --> 36:04.999
She can't help it
if she's attractive."

36:04.999 --> 36:06.999
Is she being unfairly blamed?

36:06.999 --> 36:07.999
- Takes two to tango.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.999
- Amy, do you think
she's being unfairly blamed?

36:10.999 --> 36:13.999
- I can imagine like
the place that--that would--

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
like, I can't imagine
being in your position.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
'Cause, you know, we didn't
even realize this was going on.

36:17.999 --> 36:18.999
- You know what it was?

36:18.999 --> 36:20.999
You're on a boat with
each other for six weeks.

36:20.999 --> 36:24.999
And he wasn't just some guy
I was hooking up with--

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
- Right.
- It was my neighbor,

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
roommate, coworker.

36:28.999 --> 36:31.999
And so, I think
I fell in love with Eddie

36:31.999 --> 36:32.999
as a friend
and as a person.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
So to see him say
all those mean things,

36:34.999 --> 36:36.999
like, ow, I didn't know
he hated me so much

36:36.999 --> 36:38.999
or I didn't know
he thought this little of me.

36:38.999 --> 36:42.999
And like, I'm grossed out
that he's so ashamed

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
that he was with me.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.000
And I get where
you're coming from,

36:46.999 --> 36:47.999
and I understand that,

36:47.999 --> 36:48.999
you know, you're back
with your girlfriend.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
And--and I wish
you guys the best,

36:50.999 --> 36:53.999
but your girlfriend wasn't
the only one that got hurt.

36:53.999 --> 36:56.999
- Seems like this group is
kind of piling on Rocky

36:56.999 --> 37:02.999
when you might be giving Eddie
kind of a harder time.

37:02.999 --> 37:05.999
- I didn't know that
he didn't like me like that.

37:05.999 --> 37:07.999
I didn't.

37:07.999 --> 37:08.999
- If you could go back in time,

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
is there anything about
this thing you would change?

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
- Yeah.
- What?

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
- All of it.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
- Would you--would you have not
done it in the first place?

37:16.999 --> 37:17.999
- Yeah, absolutely.

37:17.999 --> 37:18.999
- What about you?

37:18.999 --> 37:19.999
- Knowing what I know now,

37:19.999 --> 37:22.999
and knowing who this person is,

37:22.999 --> 37:23.999
and the other side of him,

37:23.999 --> 37:25.999
I don't think I would
have done it either.

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
- I'm interested to know
how your girlfriend

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
found out about
the fling with Rocky.

37:29.999 --> 37:30.999
- I told her.
- You did?

37:30.999 --> 37:33.999
When?
- Uh, almost right away.

37:33.999 --> 37:36.999
- Almost right away
when you got back?

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
- I-I called her when
I was still in the Bahamas,

37:38.999 --> 37:39.999
right before I flew home.

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.999
How'd that go?

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
- She waiting at the airport?
- What?

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
- Was she waiting
at the airport?

37:45.999 --> 37:46.999
- She was not waiting
at the airport.

37:46.999 --> 37:47.999
Let's just say that.

37:47.999 --> 37:51.999
- If you had not been caught,

37:51.999 --> 37:54.999
do you think you would
have told your girlfriend?

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
- Yeah, I think so.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
- You're still with your--
- I don't think you would have

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
told your girlfriend.

37:58.999 --> 38:01.999
I think you would've
gotten away, scotch clean.

38:01.999 --> 38:02.999
- Anything else you
have to say to her?

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
- Nope.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
I moved forward from all this.

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
You know, it's--
I'm just trying to get to

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
a stronger and happier
place in my life

38:11.999 --> 38:13.999
and in my career
and in my relationships.

38:17.999 --> 38:20.000
Okay.
- What?

38:21.999 --> 38:24.999
No, I mean,
yeah, I forgive you.

38:24.999 --> 38:25.999
- Okay, thank you.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.999
- I want to wrap
this discussion up

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
and look towards the future.

38:29.999 --> 38:31.999
Captain Lee, do you have
an upcoming charter?

38:31.999 --> 38:32.999
- I hope so.

38:32.999 --> 38:35.000
- Kate, do you see yourself
as a lifelong yachty?

38:35.000 --> 38:36.999
- No.

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
I'll see ocean and see sky.

38:38.999 --> 38:40.000
- Huh.
- And then when Virgin Galactic

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
goes to space,
first space stewardess.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.999
- Oh, I like that.
- Really?

38:43.999 --> 38:44.999
- Got to have goals.
- There you go.

38:44.999 --> 38:47.999
- That's too easy.
- Hello, rocketship.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.999
- Dave, what's next for you?
Have you set a wedding date yet?

38:49.999 --> 38:51.999
- Well, I'll be graduating
from college

38:51.999 --> 38:53.999
with my Bachelor's in January.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.999
So now that
school's almost done,

38:55.999 --> 38:57.999
Trevor and I can start
planning a wedding.

38:57.999 --> 38:58.999
- That's great.

38:58.999 --> 38:59.999
Rocky, will you continue
working on yachts?

38:59.999 --> 39:02.999
- Yeah.
- As a stew or a chef?

39:02.999 --> 39:04.999
- Um, I am doing both.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.000
- Emile, what are
your plans for the future?

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
- Travel the world.
Work on yachts.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
Open up businesses
and see where it goes.

39:12.999 --> 39:14.999
- Nice.
Amy, you have a new boyfriend?

39:14.999 --> 39:16.999
- Whoo.

39:16.999 --> 39:18.999
- Go ahead, come on.
- I got my own somebody.

39:18.999 --> 39:20.999
Hey, hey, hey.
- Really? Nice.

39:20.999 --> 39:21.999
- Hey, hot stuff.
Well, you know.

39:21.999 --> 39:23.999
- Connie, what's the next step
for you?

39:23.999 --> 39:25.999
When do we get to call you
bosun?

39:25.999 --> 39:27.999
- Uh, when Emile works under me.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.999
- I think we'd all like Emile
to work under us.

39:34.999 --> 39:38.000
- Not all.
- Below deck.

39:38.999 --> 39:39.000
- Coming up...

39:39.999 --> 39:40.999
Do you all see yourselves

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
working on yachts
three years from now?

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
- No, this was my last season
working on a yacht.

39:44.999 --> 39:45.999
- Really?

39:45.999 --> 39:48.999
What if Captain Lee made you
a first officer?

39:48.999 --> 39:49.999
- Uh...

39:56.999 --> 39:57.999
three years from now?

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
- No, this was my last season
working on a yacht.

39:59.999 --> 40:00.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.999
- What are you gonna do?

40:02.999 --> 40:04.999
- I'm gonna focus on my career
working commercial maritime.

40:04.999 --> 40:06.999
- Tug boat, tug boat.
- Tug boat, tug boats.

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
- Wow.
- You said that last year.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
- What if Captain Lee made
you a first officer?

40:10.999 --> 40:13.999
- Uh, on a tug boat,
yeah, I'm down.

40:14.999 --> 40:17.999
- Ben, you just got
back from charter in the Med.

40:17.999 --> 40:18.999
How was it?
- Mm-hmm.

40:18.999 --> 40:19.999
I mean, it was a tough season,

40:19.999 --> 40:20.999
not gonna lie,
but it was a lot of fun.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.999
- Well, Ben and the rest
of the crew

40:22.999 --> 40:24.999
of the "Ionian Princess,"

40:24.999 --> 40:28.999
they're gonna be featured
in the brand new Bravo series,

40:28.999 --> 40:31.999
Mediterranean."

40:31.999 --> 40:32.999
- Welcome to Greece!

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
- You got to take
pictures of this.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
- This blows away
that Carribean.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.999
- The Mediterranean is the most
serious circuit there is.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
- Everyone in position.

40:41.999 --> 40:42.999
- One's in position.
- Standing by at three.

40:42.999 --> 40:43.999
- Okay, go ahead
and drop and let's go.

40:45.999 --> 40:47.999
- The Med is the playground
for the rich

40:47.999 --> 40:51.999
and the place where
the it people want to be seen.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
- The guys are...
- Oh, yes!

40:53.999 --> 40:55.999
Pretty cute.

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
- I love girls on the boat.

40:56.999 --> 41:01.999
Bit of eye candy
walking around, you know.

41:01.999 --> 41:02.999
- I must admit,
when I was a stewardess

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
getting bossed around, I was
not a happy little camper.

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
I just wanted to be
the chief steward.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.999
That was that.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
- More martini, less espresso.

41:09.999 --> 41:12.999
- Living on the super yacht,

41:12.999 --> 41:13.999
the guests get exactly what
they want when they want it.

41:15.999 --> 41:18.999
- 10 more seconds
of whatever you got.

41:18.999 --> 41:20.000
- I'll do anything that
seems stupid to others people,

41:20.999 --> 41:21.999
but really fun to me.

41:21.999 --> 41:23.999
- Oh, no...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:23.999 --> 41:25.999
- Aah!
- Lifestyle treatment is...

41:25.999 --> 41:26.999
holding someone's
hair extensions

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
and wrapping them up
in a napkin

41:28.999 --> 41:30.999
with a smile.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.999
- Look, she's waiting for you.

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
Go win your hundred.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
- He has got way
more game than you do.

41:36.999 --> 41:37.999
- I could kiss you right now.
- Is that inappropriate?

41:37.999 --> 41:39.000
- Absolutely.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
- We're here to serve them,
entertain them.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.999
We're not here
to connect with them.

41:43.999 --> 41:44.999
Crossing the line
of professionalism.

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
- You're f***ing up at work,

41:45.999 --> 41:47.999
and then you're walking
down the street,

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
skulling out of
a bottle of wine.

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
- Can't f***ing please her.

41:50.999 --> 41:51.999
- What was the "entrée" tonight?

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
- I got confused when
a piece of f***ing bread

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
with salmon went out
as the f***ing starter.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.999
- You're the chief steward.

41:57.999 --> 41:58.999
Don't throw me under the bus.

41:58.999 --> 41:59.999
- His line is ripping.
- Oh, my God.

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
- f*** that.
- Bobby, what's going on?

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
Lock that line off!

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
- So you think he'll be fired?
- Yeah, I think so.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
- Danny's unconscious
on the aft deck.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
Got EMTs coming
to examine him.

42:09.999 --> 42:10.999
- Okay, copy that.
I'll be here at the scene.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.999
- You've lost my trust.

42:12.999 --> 42:13.999
- Quit holding that sh**
against me.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
- Shut your face!

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
- You've lost the respect of
your crew members.

42:16.999 --> 42:17.999
- I can't believe
I'm f***ing crying.

42:17.999 --> 42:18.999
- Pack your bags.
You can collect your tip money

42:18.999 --> 42:19.999
and your plane tickets
and go home.

42:21.999 --> 42:22.999
- I would like to leave
this charter season

42:23.000 --> 42:25.999
with no "major" regrets.

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
Yeah, baby.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.999
- Well, it's been
an intense time together.

42:30.999 --> 42:31.999
I think we should cap it off

42:31.999 --> 42:34.999
with a good stiff round
of shots.

42:34.999 --> 42:36.999
If it's good enough for
your charter guests,

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
it's certainly good for us.

42:38.999 --> 42:39.999
- Get it done.
- I got this.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
- Yeah, go on, Kate,
make yourself useful.

42:43.999 --> 42:45.999
- I've been training
for this my whole life.

42:50.999 --> 42:51.999
- Woo-whee!
- This is great.

42:51.999 --> 42:53.999
- This is really 1944.

42:53.999 --> 42:54.999
- Come on over, have a seat.
- I've never had this.

42:54.999 --> 42:57.999
- Captain Lee, I think you
should lead us in a toast.

42:57.999 --> 43:00.999
- Fair winds, following seas,

43:00.999 --> 43:01.999
and good luck.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers!

43:05.999 --> 43:06.999
- Thanks, guys.
- Salud.

43:06.999 --> 43:07.999
- Cheers.

43:10.999 --> 43:11.999
- Outstanding.
