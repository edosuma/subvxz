00:01.535 --> 00:02.670
<i>Back in the '80s,
nothing warmed your heart</i>

00:02.803 --> 00:04.938
<i>on a cold day
like winter sports.</i>

00:05.073 --> 00:06.207
<i>And each snowy season,</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:08.008
<i>my family would take
to the slopes...</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.810
<i>And by slopes,
I mean our lumpy couch</i>

00:09.943 --> 00:11.579
<i>where we'd watch 'em on TV.</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:12.646
Who was
the first guy
who thought

00:12.780 --> 00:14.315
bobsledding was
a good idea?

00:14.448 --> 00:17.418
"Let's get in this tube
and fall down a mountain
with three other dopes."

00:17.551 --> 00:21.021
Tightly packed in
a cocoon of my schmoos
huddled together for warmth.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.257
Ooh, I call center bob!

00:23.391 --> 00:24.858
I'm all about
speed skating.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.260
Actually, I do
a little at home.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.695
After Geoff waxes
our floors,

00:27.828 --> 00:29.830
I speed skate
to the fridge
in my socks.

00:29.963 --> 00:32.300
Seeing my love barrel
into our Frigidaire
for some OJ

00:32.433 --> 00:34.235
makes all that
back-breaking
waxing worth it.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.636
<i>Stay tuned
for opening day</i>

00:35.769 --> 00:37.371
<i>of the ice dancing
competition.</i>

00:37.505 --> 00:38.872
<i>Only on ABC!</i>

00:39.006 --> 00:42.843
I need to, uh,
go do some
laundry downstairs

00:42.976 --> 00:44.312
where I do laundry

00:45.179 --> 00:46.780
downstairs.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.183
Okay, well,
set it to the
"nobody cares" cycle.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.551
I too need
to abruptly leave.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.386
Just randomly going
our separate ways.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.421
A commonplace
everyday exit

00:53.554 --> 00:54.722
none of you should
examine further.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.058
None of them
suspect a thing.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.060
I'm tingling
in anticipation!

01:00.194 --> 01:01.495
Positions!

01:01.629 --> 01:03.164
<i>Yep,
they were obsessed with</i>

01:03.297 --> 01:05.566
<i>British ice
dancing superstars
Torvill and Dean.</i>

01:05.699 --> 01:07.301
Such a harrowing
and dangerous sport.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.669
They're basically
spinning around

01:08.802 --> 01:10.037
with 10-inch
butcher knives
on their feet!

01:10.171 --> 01:11.672
Barry, look at me.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.707
You don't have to
pretend the danger
is why you love this.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.476
Be open and free
with Mama.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.677
Damn it, you're right.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.612
It's the grace,
the elegance.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.014
The way the light
shines off
their costumes

01:21.149 --> 01:23.050
as they're spinning
around like human
disco balls.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.518
I know.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.287
I just don't think
my friends or our family

01:26.420 --> 01:28.456
would understand
my appreciation for
"the gorgeous game."

01:28.589 --> 01:29.923
Oh, for sure.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.825
And they'll forever
judge you
if they find out.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.161
But don't worry.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.895
Mama will take
your secret
to the grave,

01:35.028 --> 01:38.065
in our double coffin,
where our skeletons
will hold hands.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.334
No. Double coffin?
What if we don't
die together?

01:40.468 --> 01:41.702
Oh, we will.

01:41.835 --> 01:42.903
You know,
I have always
wished that

01:43.036 --> 01:45.072
you and I could take
to the ice together.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.509
You know, the very
first ever mother-son
ice dancing duo.

01:48.642 --> 01:49.843
Like Torvill and Dean?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.712
But Goldberg
and Goldberg!

01:51.845 --> 01:54.548
I love that you feelcomfortable telling me this,

01:54.682 --> 01:56.550
but that will never,
never, never, never,
never, never...

01:56.684 --> 01:57.718
Catch Mama
in a classic Lutz!

01:57.851 --> 01:59.353
No, not ready!

01:59.487 --> 02:00.821
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:04.258
<i>♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say</i>

02:06.860 --> 02:08.429
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:08.562 --> 02:12.600
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting
Clearer every day ♪</i>

02:12.733 --> 02:15.236
<i>It was January 19th,
1980-something,</i>

02:15.369 --> 02:18.306
<i>and I'd just gotten back from
an epic college orientation.</i>

02:18.439 --> 02:20.140
There he is.
How was the
big weekend?

02:20.274 --> 02:21.942
I loved every moment!

02:22.075 --> 02:24.512
And I'm basically already
an NYU legend.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.714
That sounds way wrong,
but spare no detail.

02:26.847 --> 02:30.083
Let's just say I had quite
a few tiny servings of Jell-O,

02:30.218 --> 02:31.519
which at first I thought
was the after-school treat

02:31.652 --> 02:32.886
we all love,
but guess what?

02:33.020 --> 02:33.954
There was alcohol in it?

02:34.087 --> 02:35.289
So you're aware!

02:35.423 --> 02:37.691
There I was mowing down
all the yummiest flavors.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.660
Grape, lime,
wild cherry.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.795
The whole time, I'm thinking
I had a sweet tooth,

02:41.929 --> 02:44.097
but turns out...
I'm a wild man!

02:44.232 --> 02:45.666
I sipped my aunt's
Long Island iced tea once,

02:45.799 --> 02:46.800
so, been there.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.802
Best part was,
it was packed with

02:48.936 --> 02:50.571
so many bright-eyed
incoming film students,

02:50.704 --> 02:51.872
it was like
a roomful of me's.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.607
That doesn't
sound exhausting.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.108
They kept passing
around my camera,

02:55.243 --> 02:56.810
everyone filming
with their own flair,

02:56.944 --> 02:59.980
their own panache,
their own <i>joie de vivre.</i>

03:00.113 --> 03:01.615
What fun new words!

03:01.749 --> 03:03.016
And not at all
an obnoxious peek

03:03.150 --> 03:04.552
at what freshman you
will be like.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.686
I've got the footage
right here.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.221
Let's see the Jell-O
Fellow in action!

03:08.789 --> 03:11.659
Ha! The Ed Grimley dance!
Timely and timeless!

03:11.792 --> 03:14.628
<i>"I fart in your
general direction!"</i>

03:14.762 --> 03:16.163
My <i>"Holy Grail"</i>
material killed.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.032
NYU, NYU, NYU...

03:19.166 --> 03:20.834
<i>And then
we saw something
that would alter</i>

03:20.968 --> 03:22.336
<i>the course of my life
as I knew it.</i>

03:23.637 --> 03:26.640
Oh, balls!
I don't remember this!

03:26.774 --> 03:28.041
That's definitely
you kissing a girl

03:28.175 --> 03:29.377
that isn't
your girlfriend.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.211
That can't be right.
Maybe it's for a scene?

03:31.345 --> 03:34.382
<i>That just happened!
And it wasn't for a scene!</i>

03:35.683 --> 03:37.818
What am I gonna do?
This'll ruin everything!

03:37.951 --> 03:39.052
It's clear what
the right thing to do is.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.321
You have to tell Brea.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.155
Nothing! You tell
Brea nothing.
Wait, what?

03:42.290 --> 03:43.457
You said it
yourself, Adam.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.358
You don't even
remember this.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.526
I really don't.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.762
If this tape didn't exist,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.664
none of us would even
know about this.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.033
If it were the 1880s
instead of the 1980s,

03:53.166 --> 03:55.202
you'd just be back at
the homestead clearing brush.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.370
The tape does exist,

03:56.504 --> 03:57.638
and at no point in history

03:57.771 --> 03:59.039
would Adam ever be
clearing anything.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.509
Sweet angel of deceit!

04:01.642 --> 04:03.611
Now Brea doesn't get hurt,
you don't hurt. No hurt.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.078
So much hurt!

04:05.212 --> 04:07.247
You've convinced me.
What other choice
do I have?

04:07.381 --> 04:09.149
A very obvious
other choice!

04:09.283 --> 04:12.185
<i>And so, I followed
my wise older sister's advice</i>

04:12.320 --> 04:13.687
<i>and acted like nothing
had happened,</i>

04:13.821 --> 04:15.423
<i>which was harder
than I thought.</i>

04:15.556 --> 04:18.225
Today,
we will be discussing
<i>"The Tell-Tale Heart,"</i>

04:18.359 --> 04:20.361
the story of a man
whose guilt over a lie

04:20.494 --> 04:22.062
leads to his insanity.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.531
Ah, no.
You okay?

04:23.664 --> 04:24.632
Yeah, what are you,
some kind of liar

04:24.765 --> 04:25.699
who keeps hearing
a beating heart?

04:25.833 --> 04:27.200
What? No!

04:27.335 --> 04:28.602
Just some
<i>"Tell-Tale Heart"</i> humor.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.204
I thought you
read the story,
or were you lying?

04:31.339 --> 04:32.673
Bum-bum, bum-bum,
bum-bum.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.042
FYI, I've had
three heart attacks,

04:35.175 --> 04:38.211
so if you see me
clutch my chest again,
you call a nurse.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.514
<i>Even at home,
my deception haunted me.</i>

04:40.648 --> 04:42.983
Hoo-hoo! Even with
a wonky eye,

04:43.116 --> 04:45.886
Columbo can spot a liar
a mile away.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.921
Maybe the murderer is lying
to protect someone's feelings.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.424
I was talking to the TV.
Please don't interrupt us.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.294
Hey! Off to
my weekend at Brown.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.496
I'm gonna miss you.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.897
Please have so much fun

04:57.030 --> 04:58.666
that you don't even
think about me.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.100
Wow. That's surprisingly
mature of you.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.003
Yep, I'm super mature.
I'm basically an old man.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.705
I'm George Burns
over here.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.607
"Oh, God!",
"Oh, God! Book II,"
"Oh, God! You Devil."

05:06.740 --> 05:08.041
All the vaguely
comedic greats.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.309
Odd tangent, but honestly,

05:09.443 --> 05:11.111
I'm too excited about
my trip to question it.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.180
Funny you should
mention honesty
because I'm a big fan.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.148
Okay. See ya Monday.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.453
I know you did it.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.921
I did! I'm guilty!

05:21.054 --> 05:22.289
I'm so, so guilty!

05:22.423 --> 05:24.257
You kicked the plug out
of the wall, you moron.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.760
Oh. That?

05:26.894 --> 05:28.028
Yes. I'm sorry you
had to stand.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.330
Do better.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.566
<i>While I lived in fear
that my lie would get out,</i>

05:32.700 --> 05:34.334
<i>Joanne was about to
discover that Barry</i>

05:34.468 --> 05:36.404
<i>had a secret of his own.</i>

05:36.537 --> 05:37.671
Hey, babe, can
you grab me a...

05:37.805 --> 05:39.573
Another Hostess
Pudding Pie?

05:39.707 --> 05:40.441
I know what my guy likes.

05:42.810 --> 05:43.777
<i>But maybe she didn't.</i>

05:43.911 --> 05:44.978
Hmm.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.146
<i>'Cause in that moment,</i>

05:46.279 --> 05:47.781
<i>something caught
Joanne's eye.</i>

05:47.915 --> 05:49.049
Intriguing.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.350
<i>Something scandalous.</i>

05:50.484 --> 05:52.019
That's curious.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.887
<i>Something so shameful
that if uncovered,</i>

05:54.021 --> 05:55.756
<i>it would ruin him.</i>

05:55.889 --> 05:57.991
Barry, are you super
into those British

05:58.125 --> 05:59.760
ice dancing sensations,
Torvill and Dean?

05:59.893 --> 06:02.195
Of course not.
I only like manly things.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.197
"T & D" is for
trucks and dogs.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.666
Testosterone and donuts.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.168
Tom and Doug.
You know, boys' names.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.370
<i>So she tried
a different tactic.</i>

06:10.504 --> 06:12.540
Phew, well,
that's a relief,

06:12.673 --> 06:15.709
because Torvill and Dean
are overrated garbage.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.511
You shut your gorgeous,
filthy mouth.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.513
They're ice dancing gods.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.081
I knew it.
You love them!

06:21.214 --> 06:22.483
Damn it! It's true.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.384
And I understand that
you have to pack up
and leave me.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.954
I will forever
miss your face,
hair, and bottom.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.856
You think I would
break up with you
over this?

06:28.989 --> 06:29.957
But it's the opposite
of the me that

06:30.090 --> 06:31.625
you and the world have
fallen in love with.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.027
You should be proud
of all sides of your hot,
bonkers self.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.395
Really?
Really.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.964
Okay then.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.331
I love ice dancing.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.567
You don't need
to mumble it.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.968
Say it loud,
say it proud.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.169
I love ice dancing.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.737
More. Make it
uncomfortable.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.573
I love ice dancing!
There you go!

06:45.706 --> 06:46.907
Oh, my God.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.176
Yeah.
That feels so good!

06:49.309 --> 06:50.578
Joanne.
Hmm?

06:50.711 --> 06:52.446
You lifted a great
weight from my
super-jacked shoulders.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.684
I love ice dancing!

06:56.817 --> 06:58.552
<i>While Joanne
helped Barry live his truth,</i>

06:58.686 --> 07:01.188
<i>I was still living with
the weight of my own lie.</i>

07:01.321 --> 07:02.422
<i>Until this.</i>

07:02.556 --> 07:04.357
I kissed someone
at Brown!
Oh, my God!

07:04.492 --> 07:05.993
We were doing
karaoke, and...
And I got caught up

07:06.126 --> 07:07.160
in the moment and...

07:07.294 --> 07:08.596
And the song ended,
and he kissed me.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.798
Sweet! I did the exact
same thing last
week at NYU.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.265
Wait, what?
This is perfect.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.067
I did some smooching,
you did some smooching.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.268
We're even-stevens.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.037
You're happy
about this?
Totally!

07:17.170 --> 07:19.072
Now we can both wipe
our dubious slates clean.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.209
Ooh, boy, what a relief.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.945
Hold on. You kissed
someone over a week ago

07:25.078 --> 07:26.246
and you were never
gonna tell me?

07:26.379 --> 07:27.481
I just did.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.782
Only because I told you
I kissed someone.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.718
Exactly. We're both
awful, baby.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.620
Forgive. Forget.
Even-stevens.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.388
I felt horrible,
and I told you
immediately.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.390
And you were just
gonna keep this
from me forever?

07:37.525 --> 07:39.426
Not forever.
Just TBD.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.528
I have to
think about this.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.632
What's to think about?
Even-stevens.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.466
<i>As I got
iced out by Brea,</i>

07:46.600 --> 07:48.101
<i>the Winter Games were
in full swing at home.</i>

07:48.235 --> 07:50.437
Aw, come on, USA!

07:50.571 --> 07:52.239
Canada's flag
is a leaf!

07:52.372 --> 07:54.608
That's the weakest
living thing
on the planet.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.910
Sure, I pressed
a few into
my memory journal

07:57.044 --> 08:00.113
last autumn after
a lovely drive up
to Vermont,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.449
but we should be
raking these guys up.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.417
Do better, America!

08:04.552 --> 08:06.920
Technically,
Canada is America.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.722
The best part of America.

08:08.856 --> 08:09.890
Hoo, go, Canucks!

08:10.023 --> 08:11.324
Since when are
you from Canada?

08:11.458 --> 08:13.160
Since the first moment
I met you,

08:13.293 --> 08:15.663
and subsequently
the millions of times
I've reminded you.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.164
Doesn't ring a bell,

08:17.297 --> 08:18.732
but someone's
a little proud
for nothing.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.133
We are literally
beating your team.

08:20.267 --> 08:23.003
Well, my bladder
has won out
over my laziness.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.806
I'm gonna go undo what
the iced tea did to me.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.276
You're early.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.443
Well, I guess you're
here to watch hockey

08:30.578 --> 08:32.479
with the fellas, huh?

08:32.613 --> 08:33.981
Meet me downstairs
in an hour,

08:34.114 --> 08:35.816
and we'll have some
ice dance snuggles.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.450
No need to whisper,
Mother.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.153
I come bearing
Pizza Hut pizza
as a side dish

08:40.287 --> 08:41.955
to an equally tasty
and satisfying
announcement.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.124
Hot damn! You know
how to enter
a room, son.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.126
I'll take two
slices, please,

08:46.259 --> 08:48.195
plus whatever nonsense
this is gonna be.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.831
As you indulge,
know that I,
Barry Goldberg,

08:50.964 --> 08:53.500
the epitome of all
that is manly,

08:53.634 --> 08:55.268
love the graceful
sport of ice dance.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.970
So we get
a pepperoni pie

08:57.104 --> 08:59.106
just for you to say
the thing you like?

08:59.239 --> 09:01.208
When Dolores' cousin
made "an announcement,"

09:01.341 --> 09:04.477
there was confusion and tears,
and then a happy acceptance

09:04.612 --> 09:06.513
where we all moved him up
to Greenwich Village.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.716
He now works at a bar
called Fellas.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.551
Great cocktails,
fun clientele.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.554
You're not enraged
at my betrayal
of all that is macho?

09:14.688 --> 09:17.557
Why would you ever
keep your love for ice
dancing a secret?

09:17.691 --> 09:20.193
In fact, many moons ago,
I was a competitive
ice dancer.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.895
More secrets revealed.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.096
I've talked about
this many times.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.197
You're a friend
of a friend.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.399
How much am I really
expected to invest?

09:26.533 --> 09:29.369
I was one-half of
the Torvill and Dean
of Canada.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.839
Tremblay and Brown.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.874
Now... Rest in peace,
Tremblay.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.744
You skate with
the angels now.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.411
While I've enjoyed
keeping our secret,

09:38.545 --> 09:39.713
it'll be nice
not to have to watch

09:39.847 --> 09:41.081
from the shadows anymore.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.183
And I owe it
all to Joanne.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.585
She is the wind beneath
my ice dancing wings.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.521
Moving past that
controversial comment,

09:48.656 --> 09:50.590
no, we're gonna
watch up here
tonight instead of

09:50.724 --> 09:53.226
in the basement hot tub,
where we pretend

09:53.360 --> 09:55.228
we're just
"having a normal
mother-son soak."

09:55.362 --> 09:57.765
Correction. Joanne will
share in our passion
from here on out.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.033
I can't wait
to tell her.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.534
Bye!

10:04.571 --> 10:06.039
What the
just happened?

10:10.077 --> 10:12.079
<i>After coming
clean about his love
of ice dancing,</i>

10:12.212 --> 10:14.214
<i>my brother
was free to enjoy
his favorite sport</i>

10:14.347 --> 10:15.615
<i>with his favorite girl...
And our mom.</i>

10:15.749 --> 10:18.886
Hot stuff
coming through,
and also cocoa.

10:19.019 --> 10:22.622
See, I'm playful and not
at all super miffed
and confused.

10:22.756 --> 10:25.158
<i>Yep,
someone had gotten
between their secret</i>

10:25.292 --> 10:26.326
<i>mother-son winter sport!</i>

10:26.927 --> 10:27.961
All right!

10:29.362 --> 10:30.864
Ooh! Thanks for
the hot chocolate,
Mrs. G.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.566
My pleasure, and don't
feel bad that
you showed up

10:33.701 --> 10:34.935
empty-handed
like a rude,
intrusive guest

10:35.068 --> 10:36.236
who doesn't
know her place.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.105
Shh. They're
taking the ice.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.140
Wait, is the guy Torvill
or the lady Torvill?

10:40.273 --> 10:43.643
Um, hello, Torvill
is the blonde fox

10:43.777 --> 10:45.312
in the glittering
skirt.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.982
And Dean is the
blonde stud in the
sequined tuxedo.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.785
I'm so
embarrassed for you.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.653
You're just learning.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.857
Ooh, I love how
their outfits sparkle
when they twirl.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.826
I think you mean
"twizzle."

10:58.959 --> 11:00.260
Did you hear
that, Barry?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.595
She said "twirl" when
she meant "twizzle."

11:02.730 --> 11:04.131
Is that not what it is?

11:04.264 --> 11:07.200
Oh, Joanne,
you quirky rube
who knows nothing

11:07.334 --> 11:09.737
and makes this experience
so much worse.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.039
It's fine. I didn't
learn the terms
the first time either.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.141
So is figure skating
always duos?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.809
Is there ever something
crazy like a trio?

11:15.943 --> 11:17.277
It is always two.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.746
Three is garbage

11:18.879 --> 11:21.481
in almost every situation
in life, Joanne.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.851
I'm remembering I have
a lot of homework.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.352
Aw, no, no,
come on,

11:25.485 --> 11:27.788
we haven't even
gotten to the judges'
results yet.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.657
Seems like maybe it
should just be between
the two of you.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.826
Her words, not mine.
But also my words.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.794
Mom!

11:33.927 --> 11:35.628
What's wrong with you?

11:35.763 --> 11:37.130
What's wrong with
your girlfriend
who doesn't know

11:37.264 --> 11:38.631
a leap from a Lutz?

11:38.766 --> 11:41.001
That's what this is?
You're jealous of Joanne?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.403
I thought ice dancing
was our thing.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.138
But I guess you don't
see it that way.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.876
Fine. Go.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.344
But just like when
Dean frosted
his hair right before

11:51.478 --> 11:54.948
Innsbrook in '84,
you surprised me
tonight, Mom.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.785
<i>While Barry
and my mom had it out,
I was desperate</i>

11:57.918 --> 12:00.320
<i>to find a way to get back
in with my girlfriend.</i>

12:00.453 --> 12:02.322
Thank you for
coming here
to brainstorm

12:02.455 --> 12:04.191
how to undo the damage
I've done with Brea.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.194
So far, my only idea is
"build a time machine."

12:07.327 --> 12:09.029
I once built
a soapbox car
for a derby.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.163
But my dad did
most of the work.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.598
We came in eleventh.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.633
Great, Geoff,
quick question,
if you were me,

12:13.767 --> 12:15.535
how would you sum up
that nonsense
for the chalkboard?

12:15.668 --> 12:17.370
Sorry, but this never
would have happened

12:17.504 --> 12:18.705
if you would have just
listened to my advice

12:18.839 --> 12:20.340
and come clean
right away.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.209
Please, none of this
would have happened
if you'd stuck

12:22.342 --> 12:23.844
with my advice
and never said anything.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.078
That's insane!
Is it?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.679
He could have kept
his secret forever

12:26.814 --> 12:28.982
and then had power
over Brea because
of her indiscretion.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.383
Are you the devil?

12:30.517 --> 12:31.919
That was one Halloween,
and P.S., buddy,

12:32.052 --> 12:33.586
you liked that
costume a lot.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.088
I'm sorry,
can I just ask,

12:35.222 --> 12:36.556
do you go around
hiding smooches from me?

12:36.689 --> 12:38.091
Of course not.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.759
'Cause it feels like
maybe I'm engaged

12:39.893 --> 12:40.861
to Morganna
the Kissing Bandit.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.762
Morganna the
Kissing Bandit?

12:42.896 --> 12:44.531
She's this delightful,
top-heavy woman
who goes around

12:44.664 --> 12:46.299
from ballpark
to ballpark
stealing kisses

12:46.433 --> 12:48.535
from unsuspecting
Major League
ballplayers.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.170
Funny that Morganna
was so top of mind for you.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.939
I know that you're hot
for Morganna, Geoff,

12:52.072 --> 12:53.073
and it really hurts me.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.574
I'm so sorry.
She means nothing to me,

12:54.707 --> 12:56.409
and oh, my God,
are you manipulating me

12:56.543 --> 12:57.577
to get the upper hand?

12:57.710 --> 12:58.711
You see what I did
there, Adam?

12:58.846 --> 12:59.913
These are the kinds
of tools that you need

13:00.047 --> 13:01.148
to keep in your
relationship toolbelt.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.616
Please don't listen
to my wayward fiancee.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.919
What you need to do
is throw yourself
at Brea's feet

13:06.053 --> 13:07.287
and tell her the kiss
meant nothing.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.290
I would love that,
but I kinda have
a credibility issue.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.992
She won't believe
anything I say.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.293
But there might
be someone
she would believe.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.129
Do you think
he's going to track
down Morganna?

13:16.263 --> 13:17.664
Would you like him to?
No!

13:17.797 --> 13:19.066
Yes! Maybe!

13:19.199 --> 13:20.733
Her proportions
are ridiculous,

13:20.868 --> 13:22.702
but I'm intrigued by
her eager spirit.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.137
<i>As I was determined
to repair my wrong,</i>

13:24.271 --> 13:26.339
<i>Barry wasn't feeling
quite right.</i>

13:26.473 --> 13:27.607
Is everything okay?

13:27.740 --> 13:28.808
That's what
I'm wondering.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.878
Have Torvill and Dean
lost their magic?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.445
The hairs on my arms
are laying flat.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.613
I meant with you.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.982
You have that look
on your face like when

13:35.115 --> 13:36.416
they get your
order wrong
at Burger Chef.

13:36.549 --> 13:40.087
What's so hard about
light lettuce,
12 pickles,

13:40.220 --> 13:41.688
three onion slices,
double cheese,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.757
two top buns and
ketchup-mustard at
a one to seven ratio?

13:44.892 --> 13:45.959
You like what you like.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.995
And I'm not liking this.
Hmm.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.097
Are their costumes
less shimmery
than normal?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.899
I'm no psychologist,
but I think you miss

13:52.032 --> 13:53.033
watching ice dancing
with your mom.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.635
Gross. No.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.170
And I'm furious
at her for the way
she treated you

13:57.304 --> 13:58.771
the other night.
It's okay.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.640
She clearly was missing
her special time with you,

14:00.773 --> 14:02.775
and honestly,
I kinda get it.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.177
You do?
Yeah.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.113
You two have been sharing
this one thing together

14:06.246 --> 14:09.282
every four years ever
since you were just
a jacked little boy.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.684
I guess watching
Torvill and Dean

14:11.818 --> 14:13.653
is the only thing
my mom and I do
just the two of us.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.623
Oh, I messed this up.

14:16.756 --> 14:17.857
So go make things right.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.460
I know exactly
what to do.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.462
Just go watch with her?
Not enough.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.797
My plan has to be
beautiful and intricate,

14:24.932 --> 14:26.133
like a Torvill
and Dean twizzle.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.503
I am the clay,
you are the sculptor.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.973
Mold me with your
gentle giant
sculptor hands.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.674
It would be an honor.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.310
To be clear, you are
asking me to teach
you to ice dance?

14:37.444 --> 14:39.512
Yes.
Let's not waste
another minute.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.149
But there's no ice.
And where are
my skates?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.184
You have to earn
your skates.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.053
A five, six,
seven, eight.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.688
<i>And so,
Vic taught my brother
how to dance on the ice.</i>

14:48.821 --> 14:50.557
Yes, Barry.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.392
<i>In the headboard
and nightstand section
of a furniture store.</i>

14:52.525 --> 14:53.860
<i>They cha-cha-ed,</i>

14:53.994 --> 14:55.662
<i>they spun,</i>

14:55.795 --> 14:57.564
<i>they even did
whatever this is.</i>

14:58.465 --> 15:00.867
Barry, you are ready.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.370
<i>While Vic
was teaching Barry
all of his tricks,</i>

15:03.503 --> 15:05.905
<i>I was desperately hoping
to skate by with Brea.</i>

15:06.039 --> 15:07.174
I'm not ready
to see you yet.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.576
I get it. I seem like
a scoundrel and a liar,

15:09.709 --> 15:11.744
and as much as I want
to convince you
that I didn't

15:11.878 --> 15:13.680
even know
the kiss happened,
which I didn't,

15:13.813 --> 15:15.915
I can't expect you
to take my word for it.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.085
Brea, meet
Allison Horowitz,

15:18.218 --> 15:19.652
the girl I kissed
at NYU.

15:19.786 --> 15:23.056
Oh! You brought the girl
you kissed to my house?

15:23.190 --> 15:24.391
Sup?
Allison is here

15:24.524 --> 15:25.858
to explain howmeaningless the kiss was.

15:25.993 --> 15:26.994
Allison,
you have the floor.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.428
Yeah, it felt like nothing.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.562
Thank you, Allison.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.730
Like, either
he wasn't into it,

15:30.863 --> 15:32.232
or he's just
a really bad kisser.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.666
Wasn't into it.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.268
Just lifeless
and sloppy.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.070
Okay, we get the gist.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.938
And don't worry,
I have no feelings for him.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.341
I barely even
remembered the kiss,
and as soon as I did,

15:41.474 --> 15:43.210
I called my boyfriend
and told him
the whole thing.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.245
So you told
your boyfriend
right away?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.546
Of course.
I'm not psycho.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.981
I thought
I vetted you
in the car!

15:48.115 --> 15:50.383
Adam waited a week
to tell me,
and only because

15:50.517 --> 15:52.452
of something
he kept calling
"even-stevens."

15:52.585 --> 15:53.987
It's a common expression.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.955
You waited a week?
That's not cool.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.090
I know, right?

15:57.224 --> 15:58.525
Like, why would
you wait?

15:58.658 --> 15:59.759
Did the kiss mean
more to you
than it did to me?

15:59.892 --> 16:01.294
Oh, oh!
I thought
the same thing.

16:01.694 --> 16:02.996
No!

16:03.130 --> 16:04.964
And you're kind of losing
the thread, Allison.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.299
Well, this has been fun.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.734
Maybe next time
you can bring
that weird

16:07.867 --> 16:09.569
Princess Leia doll
you keep by your bedside.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.238
She's boxed
for posterity.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.405
There's nothing
going on there.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.307
Ooh!

16:14.441 --> 16:15.575
My jacket is caught
in the door.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.843
Bye.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.649
<i>Barry had learned a few
tricks from an old pro</i>

16:22.782 --> 16:24.384
<i>and was ready to give our mom
the gift of a lifetime.</i>

16:25.285 --> 16:27.320
This isn't
"Disney on Ice."

16:27.454 --> 16:28.921
It's not.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.423
And maybe an abandoned
parking lot

16:30.557 --> 16:31.791
should have clued you in
a little earlier.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.426
Joanne,
now is not the time

16:33.560 --> 16:35.628
for a poorly planned
kidnapping attempt

16:35.762 --> 16:37.730
because you're jealous
of my eternal youth.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.266
The blonde
is in the building!

16:43.103 --> 16:44.704
Barry, what's this?

16:44.837 --> 16:47.240
Your favorite child
performing on frozen water
for your delight.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.176
If I'm dreaming,
don't wake me.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.843
I didn't know why
I was here,

16:50.977 --> 16:52.479
but now I'm very
invested.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.215
And now the student becomes
the slightly better student.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.883
<i>With that,
Barry took to the ice.</i>

16:59.486 --> 17:00.620
<i>And despite
his best efforts...</i>

17:00.753 --> 17:01.621
Charley horse!
Charley horse!

17:02.289 --> 17:04.624
Oh!

17:04.757 --> 17:05.658
<i>...he still sucked.</i>

17:07.427 --> 17:09.196
I can't help but
think I'm partially
to blame for

17:09.329 --> 17:11.131
filling a young
man's head with
encouragement.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.066
Barry, are you okay?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.834
No! I'm an idiot.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.470
This was supposed to be
my big apology

17:17.604 --> 17:19.106
for not appreciating
our time together.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.040
I'm the one who
should apologize.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.343
I wasn't very
nice to Joanne
the other night.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.011
You must think I'm crazy.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.480
Hey, we're all a little
crazy when it comes
to loving Barry.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.318
So much for your gift
of my twirling body.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.386
I think I know what
the problem is.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.521
You didn't have
the right partner.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.890
Wait. Why are you
wearing that?

17:38.024 --> 17:40.393
I've been wearing it since
the opening ceremonies.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.263
Is this the world debut
of Goldberg and Goldberg?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.497
You better believe it.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.898
Let me just put on
my skates.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.235
So you're dating
that man?

17:48.368 --> 17:49.636
He's my one and only.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.804
And there he goes,intertwined with his mom.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.308
<i>They really were.</i>

17:55.442 --> 17:57.710
<i>That day, my mom
and Barry became one.</i>

18:05.852 --> 18:08.521
<i>Somehow they moved
with grace and elegance.</i>

18:12.725 --> 18:14.127
<i>They also threw this move in.</i>

18:15.495 --> 18:17.530
<i>Yep, it was a mother-son
miracle on ice.</i>

18:22.869 --> 18:23.836
So beautiful.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.878
Are you seeing
this, Tremblay?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.880
Are you
seeing this?

18:34.013 --> 18:35.582
<i>As my mom
and Barry united</i>

18:35.715 --> 18:38.451
<i>to become the first ever
family ice dancing duo,</i>

18:38.585 --> 18:40.453
<i>I was making one last attempt</i>

18:40.587 --> 18:42.555
<i>to keep Brea and me
from falling apart.</i>

18:50.029 --> 18:51.264
You really don't quit,
do you?

18:51.398 --> 18:52.565
Not when it comes to you.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.202
Please just hear me out.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.537
No tricks this time,
just the truth.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.871
Adam,
there's nothing to say.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.072
There is.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.275
Brea, I swear on my life,
I didn't even know

19:02.409 --> 19:03.976
I kissed that girl
until I saw it on video.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.978
It meant nothing,
and I should have told you

19:06.112 --> 19:07.580
as soon as I found out.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.750
The fact that I didn't
is one of the great
regrets of my life.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.785
I get it.
We both made mistakes.

19:12.919 --> 19:13.986
You weren't wrong
about that.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.489
It's just...

19:17.490 --> 19:19.659
The thing is
I don't know...

19:19.792 --> 19:20.860
I don't know if I want
to keep doing this.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.929
Doing what?

19:23.062 --> 19:25.164
This thing where
I'm nervous
all the time about

19:25.298 --> 19:26.933
what next year's
gonna be like.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.568
I'm sure it's gonna
be hard at times,

19:28.701 --> 19:29.769
but we'll make it work.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.137
Really?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.139
I mean, we couldn't even
survive two weekends away.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.708
What... What's a full
year gonna be like?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.176
What's four years
gonna be like?

19:37.610 --> 19:38.611
Okay.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.582
I'll be the one
to say it.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.417
Whatever it is,
please don't.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.186
We need to break up.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.788

not to say it.
