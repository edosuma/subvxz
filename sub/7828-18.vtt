00:28.459 --> 00:32.871
Hello, I'm Kent Brockman,
and this is Eye on Springfield.

01:09.375 --> 01:12.162
Tonight, Springfield's answer
to the Benedictine monks:

01:12.336 --> 01:14.328
The rapping rabbis.

01:14.546 --> 01:17.547
Don 't eat pork
Not even with a fork

01:17.716 --> 01:19.175
Can 't touch this

01:19.385 --> 01:20.927
Marge, are we Jewish?

01:21.136 --> 01:23.212
No, Homer.

01:26.141 --> 01:28.811
- But first, we all stink.
- We all... Hey!

01:28.978 --> 01:34.190
According to a survey ranking Springfield
as the least popular city in America.

01:34.191 --> 01:35.934
In science, dead last.

01:36.110 --> 01:40.522
I'm telling you people,
the Earth revolves around the sun.

01:40.698 --> 01:42.156
Burn him!

01:43.534 --> 01:46.985
- What a story.
- You've stolen my soul!

01:47.204 --> 01:49.310
In culture, dead last.

01:49.248 --> 01:54.242
Eleanor, we've got to do something
about this depression. So I propose...

01:54.420 --> 01:57.337
Oh, that's right. I'm crippled.

01:57.548 --> 02:00.632
This is terrible. People
will start to avoid Springfield.

02:00.843 --> 02:03.250
But what can I do? I'm just...

02:03.429 --> 02:06.346
...one man.
- I think we should call a town meeting.

02:06.515 --> 02:09.220
If we don't do something soon,
we won't get any tourists.

02:09.393 --> 02:11.765
No tourists? I'll be ruined.

02:13.564 --> 02:16.434
Maps to movie stars' homes!

02:23.907 --> 02:26.659
Excuse me,
are you Drew Barrymore?

02:26.827 --> 02:29.116
What? Get out of here. I'm hung-over.

02:29.288 --> 02:31.861
- Sorry, Miss Barrymore.
- What?

02:33.917 --> 02:36.788
Are there any suggestions
for how to attract more tourism?

02:38.339 --> 02:42.799
The easiest way to be popular
is to leech off the popularity of others.

02:42.968 --> 02:48.342
So we propose changing our name
from Springfield to Seinfeld.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.674
I may be just a boy,
but I have an idea.

02:52.853 --> 02:55.142
If I may, I'd like to show you
a few slides.

02:55.356 --> 02:57.147
Springfield as it appears from space.

02:57.358 --> 03:00.857
Somewhere in this windy valley
is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.112
Young man, that appears to be
a picture of your rear end.

03:04.323 --> 03:06.150
So long, suckers.

03:08.827 --> 03:12.410
This is the last time I use an escape plan
devised by Milhouse.

03:12.665 --> 03:13.993
Sorry, Bart.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.292
I'm Marge Simpson,
and I have an idea.

03:17.461 --> 03:18.624
Oh, no.

03:19.296 --> 03:20.671
Marge is gonna say something.

03:20.881 --> 03:23.633
Now, I know you haven't liked
some of my past suggestions.

03:23.801 --> 03:25.674
Like switching to the metric system.

03:25.844 --> 03:29.842
The metric system
is the tool of the devil!

03:30.570 --> 03:36.120
My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead,
and that's the way I likes it!

03:36.230 --> 03:38.306
The old person's remarks
will be stricken.

03:38.482 --> 03:39.810
Who said that?

03:40.250 --> 03:41.436
But my new idea is different.

03:41.610 --> 03:45.857
I think we should hold a film festival
and give out prizes.

03:46.730 --> 03:47.947
Could we make movies
and enter them?

03:48.158 --> 03:51.527
- Yes.
- At last, an excuse to wear makeup.

03:51.745 --> 03:54.616
All in favor of Marge Simpson's
film-festival idea?

03:54.832 --> 03:57.405
Film festival! Film festival!

03:57.626 --> 04:00.960
You like my idea?
Actually, I have several others.

04:01.171 --> 04:04.457
Don 't push your luck!
Don 't push your luck!

04:06.385 --> 04:07.796
And action.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.589
Hello, I'm Bart Simpson.

04:09.763 --> 04:13.298
In the past, I've brought you such
classic films as Homer in the Shower...

04:13.475 --> 04:14.851
...and Homer on the Toilet.

04:15.190 --> 04:19.182
And now I give you The Eternal Struggle.

04:20.240 --> 04:24.210
Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny.
Stupid Dockers.

04:24.194 --> 04:27.895
Oh, the belt is buckled.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.783
Now, Maude, in our movie,
you lay baby Moses in the basket...

04:33.954 --> 04:35.746
...then put it among the reeds, okay?

04:35.956 --> 04:37.534
Lights, camera...

04:37.708 --> 04:40.709
...act-diddily-dotilly-doodilly
action Jackson.

04:44.381 --> 04:48.460
Help me!

04:51.930 --> 04:53.555
Flanders to God
Flanders to God

04:53.724 --> 04:56.974
Get off your cloud and save my Todd

05:04.568 --> 05:07.189
- Thanks, God.
- Okely-dokely.

05:07.404 --> 05:08.733
What you doing, Ma?

05:08.906 --> 05:11.278
Looking for a film critic
to judge our festival.

05:11.492 --> 05:14.300
Did you know there are
over 600 critics on TV...

05:14.203 --> 05:17.536
...and Leonard Maltin is
the best-looking of them all?

05:17.748 --> 05:22.410
Welcome to Coming Attractions.
I'm your host, Jay Sherman. Thank you.

05:22.628 --> 05:27.373
Tonight we review an aging
Charles Bronson in Death Wish IX.

05:27.549 --> 05:30.385
I wish I was dead.

05:30.594 --> 05:33.263
But first we have a special guest,
Rainier Wolfcastle...

05:33.430 --> 05:37.380
...star of the reprehensible
McBain movies.

05:37.601 --> 05:40.768
Jay, my new film is a mix
of action und comedy.

05:40.938 --> 05:44.521
It's called McBain: Let's Get Silly.

05:44.733 --> 05:49.276
Did you ever notice how men
always leave the toilet seat up?

05:49.446 --> 05:53.776
- That's the joke.
- You suck, McBain!

05:55.995 --> 05:58.320
Now my Woody Allen impression.

05:58.497 --> 06:02.198
I'm a neurotic nerd who likes
to sleep with little girls.

06:02.376 --> 06:04.748
Hey, that really sucked!

06:08.215 --> 06:11.880
The film is just me in front of
a brick wall for an hour and a half.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.590
It cost $80 million.

06:14.763 --> 06:16.637
How do you sleep at night?

06:16.807 --> 06:20.639
On top of a pile of money
with many beautiful ladies.

06:20.811 --> 06:23.170
Just asking.

06:23.230 --> 06:25.768
I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive.

06:25.941 --> 06:28.349
He's not obsessed
with his physical appearance.

06:28.527 --> 06:30.152
My ears are burning.

06:30.362 --> 06:32.734
I wasn't talking about you, Dad.

06:32.948 --> 06:36.566
No, my ears are really burning.
I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-Tip.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.955
Dear Mr. Sherman, on behalf
of the people of Springfield...

06:41.123 --> 06:44.492
...I would like to invite you
to judge our film festival.

06:44.668 --> 06:48.286
You can stay with us and enjoy
the sights and sounds of the country.

06:48.464 --> 06:51.963
- Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?
- Just a minute, Homer.

06:52.134 --> 06:53.462
Look what you made me write.

06:53.635 --> 06:56.672
Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy
our quiet little town.

06:56.847 --> 06:59.303
Sincerely, Marge Simpson.

06:59.475 --> 07:02.345
Do I really wanna leave Manhattan?

07:02.561 --> 07:07.188
Sherman, I just realized
you insulted me. Now you will die.

07:07.858 --> 07:10.147
Hey, nudnik, your shoe's untied.

07:10.361 --> 07:14.524
From here, they appear to be tied.
But I will go in for a closer look.

07:15.491 --> 07:19.358
Taxi. To the airport!

07:21.580 --> 07:26.760
On closer inspection, these are Loafers.

07:30.381 --> 07:32.919
Attention, the flight
from New York has arrived.

07:33.920 --> 07:34.669
Hey, I'm landing here.

07:38.514 --> 07:41.870
It's supposed to say Jay's name,
not yours.

07:41.266 --> 07:43.971
Oh, you're right.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.681
There you...

07:47.856 --> 07:51.854
Just a second. Oh, that should...

07:52.270 --> 07:55.277
Hello, I'm Marge Simpson,
and this is my husband, Homer.

07:55.447 --> 07:58.365
Oh, nice to meet you, Marge.
I saw your hair from the plane.

07:58.534 --> 08:03.112
And you must be the man who didn't
know if he had a pimple or a boil.

08:03.288 --> 08:04.699
It was a gummy bear.

08:05.666 --> 08:09.284
Coming up next, The Flintstones
Meet the Jetsons.

08:09.461 --> 08:11.869
I smell another
cheap cartoon crossover.

08:12.470 --> 08:15.480
Bart Simpson,
meet Jay Sherman the critic.

08:15.217 --> 08:17.506
- Hello.
- Hey, man, I really love your show.

08:17.678 --> 08:19.469
I think all kids should watch it.

08:20.389 --> 08:22.298
I suddenly feel so dirty.

08:27.813 --> 08:31.977
I don't know what's happening. It seems
our profits have dropped 37 percent.

08:32.192 --> 08:33.520
We have a bad image, sir.

08:33.693 --> 08:36.399
Research shows people see you
as something of an ogre.

08:36.613 --> 08:39.690
I ought to club them
and eat their bones.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.323
Maybe this film festival could help us.

08:41.493 --> 08:44.328
A film biography might let them
get to know the real you.

08:44.538 --> 08:46.994
Virtuous, heroic, nubile.

08:47.166 --> 08:49.324
You left out "pleasant."

08:49.501 --> 08:51.743
But I like that film-biography idea.

08:51.920 --> 08:56.214
A slick Hollywood picture
to gloss over my evil rise to power...

08:56.383 --> 08:58.127
...like Bugsy or Working Girl.

08:58.302 --> 08:59.962
Get me Steven Spielberg.

09:00.179 --> 09:04.128
- He's unavailable.
- Get his nonunion Mexican equivalent.

09:04.350 --> 09:05.808
Listen, SeÃ±or Spielbergo...

09:05.976 --> 09:09.310
...I want you to do for me
what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler.

09:13.670 --> 09:16.400
Listen, Spielbergo, Schindler and I
are like peas in a pod.

09:16.570 --> 09:19.606
We're both factory owners.
We both made shells for the Nazis.

09:19.782 --> 09:23.910
But mine worked, damn it. Now,
go out there and win me that festival!

09:27.373 --> 09:29.911
Homer, the guest should get
the last pork chop.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.350
But I'm still hungry.

09:42.930 --> 09:46.429
Mr. Sherman, I understand
you have two Pulitzer Prizes.

09:46.642 --> 09:49.975
Well, it's not like I carry them
around with me.

09:50.145 --> 09:52.352
It's so hot in here.

09:52.523 --> 09:57.979
Oh, look, here's my People's Choice
Award. Five Golden Globes...

09:59.989 --> 10:01.447
Where's my Emmy?

10:03.242 --> 10:05.780
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, I won...

10:05.953 --> 10:09.370
...the belching contest at work.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.541
Very nice, Homer.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.255
Wow, how many Pulitzer Prize winners
can do that?

10:25.431 --> 10:27.388
Just me and Eudora Welty.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.305
I invited my sisters over.

10:30.477 --> 10:33.562
Sisters. Allow me.

10:37.359 --> 10:44.260
So then I said to Woody Allen, "Well,
Camus can do, but Sartre is 'smartre.'"

10:44.241 --> 10:45.735
So original.

10:45.909 --> 10:47.238
How droll.

10:47.411 --> 10:50.910
Yeah, well,
Scooby-Doo can doo-doo...

10:51.810 --> 10:54.497
...but Jimmy Carter is smarter.

10:59.381 --> 11:03.593
- Okay, Sherman, you're a movie expert.
- So tell us, who's gay?

11:03.802 --> 11:05.676
Oh, I don't know. Harvey Fierstein.

11:05.846 --> 11:08.551
- No.
- Who else?

11:10.642 --> 11:12.600
MacGyver's gay.

11:18.609 --> 11:21.640
You badmouthed MacGyver,
didn't you?

11:25.157 --> 11:26.485
What you doing, Marge?

11:26.659 --> 11:28.735
Making the jury list
for the film festival.

11:28.952 --> 11:32.571
Mayor Quimby, Krusty, Jay.

11:32.790 --> 11:36.750
Marge, do you respect my intelligence?

11:37.878 --> 11:39.871
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:40.470 --> 11:43.665
Wait a minute. Why did it take you
so long to say yes?

11:46.950 --> 11:48.586
- No reason.
- Okay.

11:48.764 --> 11:51.884
Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?

11:54.353 --> 11:56.262
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:56.438 --> 11:58.514
Wait a minute. That's bad!

11:58.732 --> 12:01.567
Look, I know I'm not witty
like that critic guy...

12:01.735 --> 12:05.235
...but does he know all the words
to the Oscar Mayer song?

12:05.406 --> 12:09.534
Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener

12:09.702 --> 12:13.236
That is what I'd truly like to be

12:13.414 --> 12:17.162
'Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wiener

12:17.334 --> 12:24.630
Everyone would be in love with me

12:28.429 --> 12:31.216
That's it, Marge. He knows
the whole hot-dog song.

12:31.390 --> 12:37.179
Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take
a lock of your hair to remember you by.

12:37.354 --> 12:39.726
It's just you and me now, lock of hair.

12:39.898 --> 12:41.642
You don't have to do this.

12:41.859 --> 12:44.564
- You think I'm stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

12:44.778 --> 12:47.316
Prove it. Put me
on that film-jury-festival thing.

12:47.531 --> 12:50.449
Fine. You're on the jury.

12:56.415 --> 12:59.120
Sir, the actors are here
to audition for the part of you.

12:59.293 --> 13:00.668
Excellent.

13:03.547 --> 13:05.290
Excellent.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.341
- Next.
- Excellent.

13:08.552 --> 13:12.510
- Next.
- Exactly.

13:13.980 --> 13:14.427
Next.

13:16.602 --> 13:19.722
Oh, it's hopeless.
I'll have to play myself.

13:22.941 --> 13:27.936
I thought they were playing
The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight.

13:28.155 --> 13:31.524
Our first film is by Indian director
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.867
Bright Lights, Beef Jerky.

13:35.790 --> 13:37.404
Help! Help! Police!

13:37.623 --> 13:39.995
Hey, I got problems of my own
right now. Oh, boy.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.623
This is gonna get worse
before it gets better.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.955
Next, we have Moe the bartender
in Moe Better Booze.

13:50.135 --> 13:53.635
Money gets you one more round
Drink it down, you stupid clown

13:53.806 --> 13:58.966
Money gets you one more round
You're out on your ass

14:00.200 --> 14:01.396
My back!

14:03.190 --> 14:06.144
Hans Moleman Productions presents...

14:06.318 --> 14:10.670
...Man Getting Hit by Football.

14:16.412 --> 14:20.955
This contest is over.
Give that man the $ 10,000!

14:21.166 --> 14:23.918
This isn't America 's
Funniest Home Videos.

14:24.128 --> 14:30.795
But the ball, his groin.
It works on so many levels.

14:31.427 --> 14:32.755
Roll it again.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.797
Next, they're gonna show my movie.

14:34.972 --> 14:37.889
- You made a movie?
- I made a movie?

14:38.580 --> 14:41.143
No wonder I was on the cover
of Entertainment Weekly.

14:47.568 --> 14:53.938
My name is Barney Gumble.
I'm 40, I'm single, and I drink.

15:01.415 --> 15:04.120
There's a line in Othello about a drinker.

15:04.293 --> 15:08.871
Now a sensible man, by and by a fool,
and presently a beast.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.717
That pretty well covers it.

15:16.550 --> 15:20.598
It's brilliant. Savagely honest.
Tender. He has the soul of a poet.

15:20.768 --> 15:22.960
You're very kind.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.938
Excuse me. Did something crawl
down your throat and die?

15:25.105 --> 15:26.599
It didn't die.

15:26.815 --> 15:29.223
My name is Barney,
and I'm an alcoholic.

15:29.443 --> 15:31.436
Mr. Gumble, this is
a Girl Scout meeting.

15:31.612 --> 15:36.238
Is it? Or is it that you girls
can't admit you have a problem?

15:41.955 --> 15:46.499
Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.

15:58.555 --> 16:00.980
I think we have a winner.

16:00.265 --> 16:02.673
- What'd I miss?
- Homer, please pay attention.

16:02.851 --> 16:04.678
There's just one more movie.

16:16.949 --> 16:18.858
Simple villagers, I promise you...

16:19.760 --> 16:22.279
...I will close plants in America
and bring work here.

16:32.890 --> 16:35.292
We did 20 takes,
and that was the best one.

16:35.509 --> 16:38.593
Remember, Elliott, I'll be right here.

16:50.274 --> 16:52.729
- Pure egotism.
- Self-indulgent tripe.

16:52.943 --> 16:56.359
I don't care what they say.
I'm going to win this festival.

17:07.415 --> 17:09.539
Drink up, Judah Ben-Hur.

17:11.337 --> 17:15.500
You truly are the king of kings.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.172
Excellent.

17:22.970 --> 17:23.757
Smithers, are they booing me?

17:23.932 --> 17:28.594
No. They're saying,
"Boo-urns, Boo-urns."

17:28.812 --> 17:31.386
Are you saying, "Boo," or, "Boo-urns"?

17:33.776 --> 17:36.812
I was saying, "Boo-urns."

17:41.492 --> 17:44.279
All right, it's time to vote
for the grand prize.

17:44.495 --> 17:50.350
I vote for Barney Gumble's sensitive
yet unfortunately titled film, Pukahantas.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.623
- Second!
- Well, I vote for Burns' movie.

17:52.795 --> 17:57.338
Me too. Now let's get going.
I got a date with Eudora Welty.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.131
Coming, Eudora!

18:02.554 --> 18:06.173
Excellent. Bribing those
two judges has paid off.

18:06.350 --> 18:07.974
Like the Miss Teen America pageant.

18:09.770 --> 18:11.478
How can you vote for Burns' movie?

18:11.647 --> 18:15.941
Let's just say it moved me
to a bigger house!

18:16.110 --> 18:19.810
I said the quiet part loud
and the loud part quiet. Oh, dear.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.984
Two to two. Well, Homer,
it all comes down to you.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.821
Football in the Groin!
Football in the Groin!

18:26.360 --> 18:28.444
We're not gonna resolve
this deadlock anytime soon.

18:28.622 --> 18:31.956
Why don't we all take
a five-minute break. It'll clear our heads.

18:32.126 --> 18:36.455
Good idea, Marge.
My mind is going a mile a minute.

18:40.217 --> 18:42.589
I knew this would happen.
I put you on the jury...

18:42.761 --> 18:46.510
...and you vote for the stupidest film.
- I have a right to be on that jury...

18:46.682 --> 18:49.599
...even though I'm sleeping with
the head of the festival.

18:49.768 --> 18:52.603
How many times have
I heard Rex Reed say that?

18:52.813 --> 18:54.687
Great. Now you're
gonna make fun of me.

18:54.898 --> 18:56.274
No, Homer. I won't make fun.

18:56.442 --> 18:59.111
But I will suggest there may be
better things in life...

18:59.278 --> 19:04.616
...than seeing a man get hit
in the groin with a football.

19:04.783 --> 19:06.112
Well, Homer?

19:06.285 --> 19:10.234
Marge, I've got some
serious thinking to do.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.625
Barney's movie had heart.

19:14.793 --> 19:18.245
But Football in the Groin
had a football in the groin.

19:18.422 --> 19:22.122
Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.

19:22.301 --> 19:25.530
Wow, I'll never drink another beer.

19:25.220 --> 19:26.928
- Beer here.
- I'll take 10.

19:27.389 --> 19:29.970
And now to announce the winners.

19:29.266 --> 19:32.600
The award for outstanding
animated short goes to...

19:32.770 --> 19:37.930
...Itchy and Scratchy for their film
Four Funerals and a Wedding.

20:05.886 --> 20:08.128
And now the winner of the grand prize.

20:10.682 --> 20:12.260
Barney Gumble!

20:12.476 --> 20:14.100
What?

20:17.189 --> 20:22.528
Homie, you voted for the right movie.
I'm glad you were on the jury.

20:23.862 --> 20:28.774
You know something, Marge?
It's not that tough being a film cricket.

20:29.159 --> 20:31.567
I've learned I have
a gift to share with the world.

20:31.745 --> 20:37.285
From now on, there'll be a new Barnard
Gumble. Hardworking, clean and sober.

20:37.459 --> 20:40.579
Congratulations, Barney.
And enjoy your grand prize...

20:40.754 --> 20:44.400
...a lifetime supply of Duff Beer.

20:44.258 --> 20:47.792
Just hook it to my veins!

20:49.305 --> 20:53.385
Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play
Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call.

20:53.559 --> 20:55.468
And if you ever want
to visit my show...

20:55.686 --> 20:57.145
We're not gonna be doing that.

20:57.313 --> 20:59.222
I hope you tell your New York friends...

20:59.398 --> 21:02.518
...that people in small towns aren't
quite as dumb as they think.

21:02.693 --> 21:05.650
Marge, look.
This has spring snakes inside...

21:05.237 --> 21:08.321
...but the suckers
will think it's beer nuts.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.904
Beer nuts.

21:11.577 --> 21:14.780
Well, it was a lovely festival.
The best movie won...

21:14.955 --> 21:18.371
...and Mr. Burns found there are
some awards that can't be bought.

21:18.542 --> 21:19.740
And the Oscar goes to...

21:21.211 --> 21:24.711
I've got to win this one.
I bribed everyone in Hollywood.

21:24.923 --> 21:28.127
...George C. Scott in
Man Getting Hit by Football.

21:34.933 --> 21:37.306
My groin.

22:32.825 --> 22:34.901
