It was a civil trial.
Mm-hmm.

26:56.842 --> 26:58.909
They ruled against me
sort of.

26:59.009 --> 27:01.110
Fined me a whole dollar.

27:01.210 --> 27:03.578
Oh, well,
that's not so bad.
Nah.

27:07.212 --> 27:10.180
Is it true your mom
was a prostitute?

27:10.280 --> 27:12.247
She was a good person.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.815
She did her best
to take care of me.

27:14.915 --> 27:17.049
And somebody killed her?

27:17.149 --> 27:18.450
Yeah, they did.

27:18.550 --> 27:21.385
I wish you could have met
your grandmother.

27:21.451 --> 27:22.386
You would have loved her.

27:22.485 --> 27:25.086
She would have loved you.

Yes, ma'am.

Are you anti-gun now?

27:46.994 --> 27:48.094

27:48.194 --> 27:49.761
You didn't even bother
to find out.

27:49.861 --> 27:52.029
Okay, sorry.

I'm all for you

27:57.831 --> 28:00.865

it's Harry the fun-loving dad

28:00.965 --> 28:03.400
and me the disapproving,
disciplinarian mom.

28:03.466 --> 28:06.834
First time I've ever been
accused of being fun-loving.

28:10.068 --> 28:12.069
Look at the waits stuff?

28:12.169 --> 28:13.136
You knew I would.

28:13.236 --> 28:15.538
And?

28:15.638 --> 28:18.971
When I heard the name
raynard waits,

28:19.071 --> 28:21.607
I thought
it was an alias.

28:21.707 --> 28:24.708
There's this character
in medieval French literature,

28:24.808 --> 28:25.908
Reynard the fox.

28:26.008 --> 28:27.141
Reynard means fox.

28:27.241 --> 28:29.042
Anyway,
he's sly and selfish,

28:29.142 --> 28:32.411
and he uses his cunning
to triumph over brute strength.

28:32.477 --> 28:35.144
Usually
a dull-witted wolf.

28:35.244 --> 28:38.045
Puts me
the dull-witted wolf.

28:38.145 --> 28:41.079
You're a cop, so you
symbolize brute strength.

28:41.179 --> 28:42.547
So, he taunts and calls you

28:42.647 --> 28:45.048
because he's reveling
in outwitting you.

28:45.148 --> 28:47.181
Convinced he's smarter
than we are.

28:47.281 --> 28:48.982
That's typical
of psychopaths.

28:49.082 --> 28:50.316
Anyway, in the stories,

28:50.417 --> 28:52.250
he has a castle
where he goes to hide,

28:52.418 --> 28:53.884
a place where he waits.

28:53.984 --> 28:57.453
So, things he took
from the hardware store --

28:57.553 --> 29:00.521
the sump pump, the lights --
these are all for his lair.

29:00.621 --> 29:02.087
What about the mothballs?

29:02.187 --> 29:03.488
When I was a kid,

29:03.588 --> 29:05.255
my dad used to throw them
under the house

29:05.423 --> 29:06.423
to get rid of the rats.

29:06.523 --> 29:08.957
Okay, so basement
or dungeon.

29:09.057 --> 29:10.458
Yeah.

29:10.558 --> 29:12.658
Now, his familiarity
with these folk tales

29:12.758 --> 29:14.592
is unusual for an American,

29:14.692 --> 29:18.227
so he's probably French
or has a French background

29:18.327 --> 29:20.227
or studied French in school.

29:20.327 --> 29:21.629
Look at this.

29:23.695 --> 29:26.896
I was looking
into the coroner's report.

29:26.996 --> 29:28.030
The other detectives

29:28.130 --> 29:29.564
characterize waits
as homosexual,

29:29.664 --> 29:31.297
but I don't think
that's right.

29:31.432 --> 29:33.866
Preys on gay men,
prostitutes, hustlers.

29:33.966 --> 29:36.600
Yeah, but I don't think
he sees himself as gay,

29:36.700 --> 29:38.668
or at least
he's deeply conflicted.

29:38.768 --> 29:42.268
Because look, the two rapes
that we know of,

29:42.436 --> 29:44.503
they were post-mortem
and they were brutal,

29:44.603 --> 29:47.438
which means he can only
achieve an erection

29:47.538 --> 29:49.839
after the satisfaction
of that rage.

29:49.938 --> 29:52.440
Any idea of the origin
of that rage?

29:52.473 --> 29:55.340
Well, murderers who exhibit
this kind of behavior

29:55.441 --> 29:57.675
usually were sexually abused
as children,

29:57.775 --> 30:00.075
so my guess is
he was raped as a boy

30:00.175 --> 30:02.043
and what started out
as revenge

30:02.143 --> 30:03.444
has become a compulsion.

30:03.544 --> 30:07.145
The hardware store,
jacking of the truck.

30:07.244 --> 30:09.679
He's breaking pattern.

30:09.779 --> 30:13.480
He's playing his endgame.

30:13.580 --> 30:17.248
He likes the risk,
the adrenaline rush, the dare.

30:17.348 --> 30:20.450
He wants attention,
especially yours.

30:20.550 --> 30:23.350

take this guy alive.
