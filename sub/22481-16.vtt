Jules!

01:08.816 --> 01:10.650
Jules!

01:10.684 --> 01:12.919
Rick! Help!

01:12.953 --> 01:14.487
Rick!

01:17.124 --> 01:18.758
Rick!

01:18.792 --> 01:20.793
Rick!

01:20.828 --> 01:22.662
Rick!

01:22.696 --> 01:24.998
Rick! Rick.

01:25.032 --> 01:26.332
No, no.

01:26.367 --> 01:29.302
No! Rick!

01:29.336 --> 01:30.937
- No!
- Careful with her.

01:30.971 --> 01:32.905
No, no, no!

01:37.845 --> 01:39.846
Not the plan!

01:51.859 --> 01:54.427
How is he the one and only witness?

01:54.461 --> 01:56.829
Probably 'cause all anybody saw
was the ass of the person

01:56.864 --> 01:58.598
in front of them when they
were running out the door.

01:58.632 --> 02:00.099
My team cleared the scene.

02:00.134 --> 02:02.258
Robbery-Homicide wants our help
until these shooters get got.

02:02.292 --> 02:03.952
We put an APB out
on the plate he gave us,

02:03.986 --> 02:05.426
in case he turns out to be reliable.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.006
Okay, what do you know
about this guy so far?

02:07.041 --> 02:08.374
Private bodyguard.

02:08.408 --> 02:10.842
Says the rich chick
he's babysitting got snatched.

02:10.877 --> 02:13.613
Rick Owens, 25. No outstandings.

02:13.647 --> 02:15.281
Valid permit to conceal and carry.

02:15.315 --> 02:16.883
Works for Granger Protection.

02:16.917 --> 02:18.117
That's expensive muscle.

02:18.152 --> 02:21.120
Well, you don't always get
what you pay for.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.892
Her name's Juliette
Carlton, with a "C," 22.

02:25.926 --> 02:28.027
Address: 115 DeMille Drive, Los Feliz.

02:28.062 --> 02:29.962
I already gave all this
information to the sergeant,

02:29.997 --> 02:33.566
sir, but he sees me more as
a, uh, suspect than a witness.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.355
Semper fi.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.536
All the way.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.204
- Who were you with?
- 1/1.

02:38.238 --> 02:39.953
1st Battalion, 1st Marines.
When'd you get out?

02:39.988 --> 02:41.874
- 2014.
- Iraq.

02:41.909 --> 02:43.142
Oorah.

02:43.177 --> 02:44.710
- You?
- 1/9.

02:44.745 --> 02:46.450
'94 to '98. Somalia.

02:46.484 --> 02:48.815
Camp Pendleton was home base
for both of us.

02:48.849 --> 02:50.349
I still got friends down there.

02:51.552 --> 02:53.820
Why does Juliette need a Marine?

02:53.854 --> 02:56.189
Well, she's smart in every way
except street smart.

02:56.223 --> 02:58.296
She got herself mixed up with
a bunch of lowlifes who thought

02:58.331 --> 03:00.359
she was a walking, talking ATM.

03:00.394 --> 03:02.003
Her parents hired us to back 'em off.

03:02.037 --> 03:03.200
Okay, who's Steven Earl Webb?

03:03.234 --> 03:04.479
Top of my list for this.

03:04.514 --> 03:06.899
Open complaint from the girl,
two gun violations,

03:06.934 --> 03:08.935
a pending case with intent to sell.

03:08.969 --> 03:10.413
How's this clown even on the street?

03:10.448 --> 03:12.159
Moves enough drugs
to pay the right lawyers.

03:12.194 --> 03:13.739
- Boyfriend?
- She thought so.

03:13.774 --> 03:15.341
It was all about the money for him.

03:15.375 --> 03:16.579
Wasn't happy
when we shut off the cash flow.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.245
On parole. Address of record is...

03:19.279 --> 03:20.836
2017 Wilcox.

03:20.837 --> 03:22.337
I make it a point to know
where to find him.

03:22.371 --> 03:24.172
Okay, that's nearby. They
couldn't have moved her too far,

03:24.207 --> 03:25.334
with the APB and all the blue

03:25.359 --> 03:26.448
- on the streets.
- That's right.

03:26.483 --> 03:27.823
I can give you positive I.D. on Webb.

03:27.848 --> 03:28.948
- Let me come with.
- No.

03:28.983 --> 03:30.645
- Please. I'm the one who lost her.
- Rick, you know

03:30.680 --> 03:32.814
I can't do that.
Go get your arm patched up.

03:34.617 --> 03:36.451
He's good to go.

03:36.485 --> 03:39.421
Seems like we might need to make
a parole compliance search.

03:39.455 --> 03:41.189
Quicker than a warrant, for sure.

03:41.224 --> 03:43.158
Video cam at the back door
is just for show.

03:43.192 --> 03:44.449
It's a swipe-only business, no cash.

03:44.484 --> 03:46.261
These dudes weren't virgins.
They knew how.

03:46.295 --> 03:47.929
All right, look, if we don't
find this girl based on the tip,

03:47.964 --> 03:49.197
which could be bogus, we need to get

03:49.232 --> 03:50.632
with the family in case a call comes in.

03:50.666 --> 03:52.033
- I'll take the parents.
- Sending you the coordinates.

03:52.068 --> 03:53.201
Maybe they know something useful.

03:53.236 --> 03:55.470
You just want to keep
your kids safe, and you can't.

03:55.504 --> 03:57.038
Not every second.

03:57.073 --> 03:59.014
That's the dirty secret of parenthood.

03:59.642 --> 04:01.584
This stuff really winds him up.

04:30.039 --> 04:32.741
I hate that dog.

04:32.775 --> 04:34.743
We could shoot it.

04:34.777 --> 04:36.478
What's the matter with you?

04:48.624 --> 04:51.660
Metro SWAT! Get down!

04:51.694 --> 04:53.762
Hands behind your back!

04:55.598 --> 04:56.698
Get down! Give me your hands!

04:56.732 --> 04:58.700
Hands, now! Hands behind your back!

04:58.734 --> 05:00.435
Okay, okay, okay! Hey!

05:00.469 --> 05:01.993
Suspect running side three!

05:09.812 --> 05:11.379
Get up.

05:12.915 --> 05:14.916
How far did you really think
you were gonna get?

05:14.951 --> 05:18.420
All clear. Girl's not here.
No sign that she ever was.

05:18.454 --> 05:20.262
Tan, get him out of here.

05:21.757 --> 05:24.926
Get up. Get up.

05:24.961 --> 05:27.453
- Where's Juliette?
- She's why you broke down my doors?

05:27.487 --> 05:29.064
Where you been the last
couple hours, Steven?

05:29.098 --> 05:32.567
Right here. I ordered pizza.
You can track it.

05:32.601 --> 05:33.860
My neighbor saw me.

05:33.894 --> 05:35.704
H-He was outside with that dog
you're hearing.

05:35.738 --> 05:37.038
He'll tell you I've been here all night.

05:37.073 --> 05:39.607
Working hard on
a pharmaceutical empire? Huh?

05:39.642 --> 05:41.710
So you're gonna violate me
because of her?

05:41.744 --> 05:43.244
Whatever trouble Juliette's in,
she probably

05:43.279 --> 05:45.480
went looking for it;
got nothing to do with me.

05:45.514 --> 05:47.716
She was kidnapped from a club tonight.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.818
Just a few blocks from you.

05:49.852 --> 05:51.319
Well, I haven't seen her in a month.

05:52.688 --> 05:55.390
Oh. Sounds like your ride's here.

05:55.424 --> 05:56.825
- Get up. Get up!
- Get up.

05:58.928 --> 06:01.296
All right, let's go.

06:03.966 --> 06:05.300
Do you have kids, Sergeant?

06:05.334 --> 06:06.835
I have three, all under six.

06:06.869 --> 06:07.836
- Any girls?
- Yeah.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.945
My middle one. She's five.

06:09.979 --> 06:12.440
- Enjoy her while she'll let you.
- Juliette's our only child.

06:12.475 --> 06:16.111
She likes to say that how
she grew up isn't who she is.

06:16.145 --> 06:17.912
She's trying to make her own way.

06:17.947 --> 06:19.481
In all the wrong ways.

06:19.515 --> 06:20.949
- Have you had threats?
- No.

06:20.983 --> 06:22.117
Any business enemies?

06:23.152 --> 06:25.687
- We make a doll.
- You know Jammin' Julie?

06:25.721 --> 06:27.322
Juliette's the real-life inspiration.

06:27.356 --> 06:28.656
His kids are too young, Gina.

06:28.691 --> 06:31.760
It's a very popular doll line
for preteen girls.

06:31.794 --> 06:33.290
Bought us this house.

06:33.325 --> 06:34.696
Money can create enemies.

06:34.730 --> 06:35.764
Is there anybody like that in your life?

06:35.798 --> 06:37.465
I don't know anyone who hates us.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.268
That's all we've been talking
about since the police called.

06:40.302 --> 06:42.719
Why us? Why her?

06:46.242 --> 06:47.709
Hello?

06:47.743 --> 06:49.044
- Mommy?
- I'm here.

06:49.078 --> 06:50.663
We're both right here, baby.

06:50.698 --> 06:53.615
I'm supposed to say they want
$5 million in 24 hours.

06:53.649 --> 06:55.568
- Who?
- Who?

06:55.603 --> 06:57.285
I don't know.
They're gonna make me call back

06:57.319 --> 07:00.789
to tell you how to pay it.
I'm supposed to say "no police."

07:00.823 --> 07:03.525
Daddy, I...

07:05.728 --> 07:13.772
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:41.258 --> 07:43.493
Thank you for your time.

07:44.713 --> 07:46.915
Any chance it's a hoax?

07:46.949 --> 07:48.917
The girl sounded legit
scared on the phone.

07:48.951 --> 07:50.685
Could still be somebody in her life.

07:50.719 --> 07:52.320
She seems to be a terrible
judge of character.

07:52.354 --> 07:55.423
How reliable is the bodyguard?
Could he be in on this?

07:55.457 --> 07:57.792
He sent you to the wrong place,
bought a little time.

07:57.826 --> 07:59.994
- He caught a bullet for her.
- Plans go wrong.

08:00.029 --> 08:02.430
Mistakes happen. Or maybe they decided

08:02.465 --> 08:04.032
to split the ransom four ways
rather than five.

08:04.066 --> 08:07.035
No, this kid seems like
he has real feelings for her.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.436
Robbery-Homicide is here.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.025
Phil Granger, Granger Protection.

08:11.059 --> 08:12.627
I provide security for the family.

08:12.661 --> 08:13.895
Captain Cortez.

08:13.929 --> 08:15.463
Sergeant Kay. Sergeant.

08:15.497 --> 08:16.917
- Sergeant Harrelson.
- Hi, Sergeant.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.885
Having protection usually
keeps you from needing it.

08:18.919 --> 08:20.553
- She wasn't a soft target.
- There's a lot of rich kids

08:20.587 --> 08:22.055
in I.A. without security to go after.

08:22.089 --> 08:23.556
Richer kids, famous kids.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.391
You know Juliette and her family.

08:25.426 --> 08:26.580
What's your working theory?

08:26.614 --> 08:29.162
No clue, or I would've used
strict protocol.

08:29.196 --> 08:32.065
Look, the family is ready
and able to pay the ransom.

08:32.099 --> 08:34.000
It doesn't guarantee her safe return.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.467
I agree with you, Sergeant. I-I told them

08:35.501 --> 08:37.236
Juliette's best chance
is if you find her first.

08:37.270 --> 08:39.138
Have you had any problems
with your guy before?

08:39.173 --> 08:41.307
Oh, zero. No-no, I hire
vets like Rick because

08:41.342 --> 08:43.698
they already own the skills and
discipline for the work, so...

08:43.698 --> 08:45.565
He's taking it personally.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.100
Every one of my guys takes
the job personally.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.435
Look, I'm gonna do my own investigation

08:48.469 --> 08:49.569
into how this happened, all right?

08:49.604 --> 08:51.822
So anything you need,
please, just let me know.

08:51.856 --> 08:52.975
Will you excuse me? HONDO: Yeah.

08:53.009 --> 08:54.608
Thank you.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.351
<i>Her parents want her to stay in the box.</i>

08:57.386 --> 08:59.293
You know? Play tennis at the club,

08:59.327 --> 09:00.907
volunteer for charity,
marry some rich dude

09:00.907 --> 09:02.408
who knows all the rules.

09:02.926 --> 09:04.093
Juliette's not like that.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.294
It sounds like you're buddies.

09:05.329 --> 09:07.363
No, no. I know the job.

09:07.397 --> 09:09.065
Hands off.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.566
Rick, is there any chance
that Juliette was involved?

09:10.601 --> 09:11.901
Some gripe with her parents?

09:11.935 --> 09:13.536
Some trust fund money that
she was tired of waiting on?

09:13.570 --> 09:15.137
You think she helped fake
her own kidnapping?

09:15.172 --> 09:16.472
She wouldn't be the first.

09:16.506 --> 09:17.940
No, I was there. I saw what happened,

09:17.975 --> 09:19.575
how scared she was,
and I couldn't protect her.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.377
- You did the maximum.
- I have been teaching her

09:21.411 --> 09:23.212
what to do if something
like this ever happened.

09:23.247 --> 09:25.580
Tradecraft, you know,
to try to stay alive.

09:25.614 --> 09:27.750
I talked to one of my buddies
at Pendleton about you.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.218
Sergeant Anders.

09:29.253 --> 09:30.887
I thought you'd call.

09:30.921 --> 09:32.588
He said you were the best Marine
in his unit.

09:32.623 --> 09:34.590
That's really nice to hear. That's
not all he said, though, is it?

09:34.625 --> 09:35.791
He mentioned there'd been an incident

09:35.826 --> 09:36.826
that got you in trouble.

09:36.860 --> 09:38.094
But he vouched for your loyalty

09:38.128 --> 09:39.896
and your courage 100%.

09:39.930 --> 09:42.398
Rick, you couldn't have
stopped this once it got going.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.434
You're gonna find her, right?

09:45.469 --> 09:47.169
Sergeant Luca's gonna stay
with you until we do.

09:47.204 --> 09:49.322
Yeah, 'cause you got to keep eyes on me.

09:50.281 --> 09:51.974
- That's procedure.
- How about protection?

09:52.009 --> 09:53.576
You're the only witness we got right now,

09:53.610 --> 09:55.177
and these guys were willing
to throw bullets at you.

10:02.931 --> 10:05.666
Don't worry. I'm good company.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.827
Here's what you're doing
Saturday, four weeks from now.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.629
Do I have to train for it?

10:13.664 --> 10:16.168
- Only if you can't dance.
- Save the date.

10:16.202 --> 10:18.701
- I'm getting married.
- Again?

10:18.735 --> 10:20.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:20.070 --> 10:22.038
Rocker already gave me
the "three strikes" joke.

10:22.072 --> 10:23.773
But practice makes perfect, right?

10:23.807 --> 10:25.708
I-I didn't even know that
you were dating someone new.

10:25.742 --> 10:27.810
What do you think,
I keep these arms home alone?

10:27.844 --> 10:30.590
- We met a month ago.
- Where?

10:30.624 --> 10:33.349
No, she's not an exotic dancer, okay?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.051
I'm done with those.

10:35.085 --> 10:37.453
Nikki's a physical therapist.

10:37.487 --> 10:39.956
- Like a masseuse?
- She does massage,

10:39.990 --> 10:43.859
but it's at a nice spa,
a medical spa, Beverly Hills.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.394
Is that where you met her?

10:45.429 --> 10:48.164
I-I thought this was the
grub room, not interrogation.

10:48.198 --> 10:51.367
I'm sorry. Hey, congratulations.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.069
I'm happy for you.

10:53.103 --> 10:55.171
She was in front of me
at the dry cleaners.

10:55.205 --> 10:57.840
You know, I saw her uniforms,
she saw mine.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.809
We started talking.

10:59.843 --> 11:01.911
Went for coffee,
which turned into happy hour,

11:01.945 --> 11:03.579
which turned into dinner,

11:03.613 --> 11:06.048
and I'm still at her place.
Isn't that wild?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.351
- You moved in with her?
- Hey.

11:08.385 --> 11:09.585
When it's right, it's right.

11:09.619 --> 11:11.153
You know, a happy marriage starts

11:11.188 --> 11:12.855
the first day you meet,
just like you and Annie.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.224
Well, we did not rush into things.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.361
Yeah, but you could have. Same results.

11:18.917 --> 11:21.085
See, I really want this to work.

11:21.119 --> 11:22.953
I'm even eating vegan for her.

11:22.988 --> 11:26.524
So, any advice from the happy home front?

11:26.558 --> 11:28.759
Yeah. Take your time.

11:28.793 --> 11:31.362
Take your time before
jumping into anything.

11:31.396 --> 11:34.793
Four weeks seems like...
plenty of time already.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.967
I guess I'm just an incredible romantic.

11:37.002 --> 11:38.702
But maybe that's bragging.

11:38.737 --> 11:42.406
Rest of your team's invitations
are in their locker.

11:46.745 --> 11:48.312
You want information,
you don't even offer

11:48.346 --> 11:50.281
a sandwich or a latte?

11:50.315 --> 11:51.715
That's just rude.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.317
What would you like, Hopkins?

11:53.351 --> 11:54.818
A week in Hawaii. Maybe two.

11:54.853 --> 11:56.153
How is it you and I

11:56.187 --> 11:57.588
came through the same station,

11:57.622 --> 11:59.156
now you're SWAT, and I'm still sitting

11:59.190 --> 12:00.591
in puddles of beer in Hollywood?

12:00.625 --> 12:01.840
Least, I hope it's beer.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.827
Stop complaining.
You were always hounding

12:03.862 --> 12:05.429
Sergeant Yates for more undercover work.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.298
Got your wish.

12:07.332 --> 12:08.566
You were staked out here
when the club got shot up?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.441
Trying to grab
a crew of car thieves, yeah.

12:10.476 --> 12:11.729
Set out a honey trap,

12:11.763 --> 12:13.237
unlocked, key in the ignition.

12:13.271 --> 12:15.739
Waited and waited.

12:15.774 --> 12:17.945
I know you miss our
stakeout nights together, Tan.

12:17.979 --> 12:20.217
- No, I do not.
- Now I'm hurt.

12:20.252 --> 12:23.514
- No action on your vehicle?
- Sometimes crooks get smart.

12:28.653 --> 12:29.853
He's got something.

12:29.888 --> 12:31.322
Hopkins spotted a car cruising around

12:31.356 --> 12:33.857
last night before the shoot-out.
Matches the description.

12:33.892 --> 12:35.876
Saw it parked at the 170 Motel
around the corner.

12:35.911 --> 12:36.996
He figured tourists.

12:37.021 --> 12:38.596
Out-of-towners can't tell the difference

12:38.630 --> 12:40.030
between Hollywood-the-hood
and Hollywood-the-biz.

12:40.065 --> 12:41.699
- Is it still there?
- One way to find out.

12:41.733 --> 12:43.454
Let's go.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.373
24-David. Show us Code 6,

12:49.407 --> 12:51.609
1700 block Harvard Boulevard, Hollywood.

12:51.643 --> 12:52.977
It's not the plate we want.

12:53.011 --> 12:54.278
Doesn't match the car
in the database, either.

12:54.312 --> 12:56.280
Front desk will have a copy of the I.D.

12:56.314 --> 12:57.648
from check-in. We can run the name.

12:57.682 --> 12:58.983
Even if it's fake, the clerk will know

12:59.017 --> 13:00.217
which room goes with that car.

13:01.591 --> 13:03.426
All right.

13:08.159 --> 13:11.028
I'll do a casual walk-by.

13:47.699 --> 13:49.433
26-David to Command.

13:49.467 --> 13:50.534
Shots fired.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.536
Four suspects with the hostage.

14:27.439 --> 14:30.441
24-David. We have four suspects
driving northbound

14:30.475 --> 14:33.077
on Harvard Boulevard
in a silver Chrysler 300.

14:42.921 --> 14:45.589
24-David. We've lost visual.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.124
We need backup and an airship.

14:47.158 --> 14:49.927
Command to 24-David.
Airships are not close enough.

14:49.961 --> 14:52.129
I have units rolling Code 3
to your location.

14:52.163 --> 14:54.331
Roger that.

16:00.064 --> 16:01.698
Oh, my...

16:01.733 --> 16:02.733
Come on, move, move!

16:02.767 --> 16:03.834
Move, come through!

16:11.943 --> 16:13.577
Oh, my parents are gonna kill me.

16:13.611 --> 16:16.013
- I might save them the trouble.
- Yeah, don't do that.

16:16.047 --> 16:17.648
<i>24-David to Command,</i>

16:17.682 --> 16:19.016
<i>show us in a traffic collision.</i>

16:19.050 --> 16:21.714
We're involved. Suspects gone.

16:24.602 --> 16:25.736
You're sure Juliette wasn't hurt?

16:25.770 --> 16:27.738
Look, these guys need to keep her alive.

16:27.772 --> 16:29.106
All right? They want the money.

16:29.140 --> 16:30.340
Well, she's only 22.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.575
Shouldn't be her last birthday.

16:31.609 --> 16:34.144
No, it shouldn't.

16:36.697 --> 16:38.031
This is Rick.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.499
Rick, it's me.

16:39.534 --> 16:40.867
I got hold of a phone like you taught me.

16:40.902 --> 16:42.135
I'm locked in the trunk.

16:42.170 --> 16:43.470
Different car. They changed cars.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.905
Keep her on the line. Come on, man.

16:44.939 --> 16:46.373
All right, stay on the phone,
deep breaths, keep quiet.

16:46.407 --> 16:47.808
We can use this to track the signal.

16:47.842 --> 16:49.176
What kind of car are you
in and what color?

16:49.210 --> 16:50.744
I-I don't know, I couldn't see.

16:51.645 --> 16:54.014
All right, come on, now. I know it's
not a smartphone, but I need better

16:54.048 --> 16:55.182
than five square miles, people.

16:55.216 --> 16:56.583
Okay, shh-shh.

16:56.617 --> 16:58.084
Don't let 'em hear you.

16:58.119 --> 17:00.153
You see the glow-in-the-dark cable?

17:00.188 --> 17:02.189
That's the emergency release...
you remember?

17:02.223 --> 17:03.756
They cut the cables.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.059
Do you recognize any of 'em?

17:06.093 --> 17:07.493
No, no, they never
let me see their faces.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.994
Okay, that's a good sign.

17:09.030 --> 17:10.763
That means they're thinking
of your future.

17:10.798 --> 17:12.566
Now feel around for anything
you can use as a weapon.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.733
Okay? Try to pull up the carpet.

17:13.768 --> 17:14.901
There should be a tool kit.

17:14.935 --> 17:16.603
I can't find it.

17:16.637 --> 17:17.838
Okay, that's all right, that's all right.

17:17.872 --> 17:19.772
Keep trying.

17:19.807 --> 17:21.708
I want you back with me.

17:21.742 --> 17:24.109
I-I hear a helicopter.

17:24.145 --> 17:26.146
One of yours?

17:28.316 --> 17:30.517
This is 20-David to Air 17,
what's your location?

17:30.551 --> 17:32.185
Air 17 to 20-David,

17:32.220 --> 17:34.387
we are inbound to the pad
above beautiful Hollywood.

17:34.422 --> 17:35.956
Air 17, hold your location.

17:35.990 --> 17:37.390
Roger that.

17:37.425 --> 17:38.592
We can use flyover noise.

17:38.626 --> 17:39.960
To shrink the search zone.

17:39.994 --> 17:41.361
The louder it gets, the closer she is.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.596
She can help us right now.

17:42.630 --> 17:44.764
This is 20-David to Air 17.

17:44.799 --> 17:46.032
We have a kidnapping in progress,

17:46.067 --> 17:48.034
unknown vehicle, hostage on board. Over.

17:48.069 --> 17:49.903
Copy. Hold your altitude.

17:49.937 --> 17:51.571
Orbit right, maintain that pattern.

17:51.606 --> 17:52.873
Roger.

17:52.907 --> 17:54.641
Jules, you still hear the helicopter?

17:54.675 --> 17:55.909
Yes, yes.

17:55.943 --> 17:58.111
Is it moving closer or farther away?

17:58.145 --> 17:59.603
Farther.

18:00.414 --> 18:03.049
20-David to Air 17,
I need you to come around.

18:03.084 --> 18:04.951
Roger. Air 17 coming around.

18:04.986 --> 18:06.653
Closer or farther now?

18:06.687 --> 18:07.988
It's closer but not close.

18:08.022 --> 18:10.657
Air 17, tighten your perimeter.

18:10.691 --> 18:11.892
Copy.

18:11.926 --> 18:14.261
That's closer.

18:14.295 --> 18:15.428
- Luca.
- Right here, boss.

18:15.463 --> 18:17.105
- We need proximity.
- Yeah.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.498
Load the rest of the team.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.267
I'll send GPS coordinates to the truck.

18:20.301 --> 18:21.334
You got it, boss.

18:21.369 --> 18:22.836
Hello?

18:22.870 --> 18:25.071
20-David to Air 17,
I need you to sweep the area.

18:25.106 --> 18:26.339
Copy.

18:26.374 --> 18:28.275
Do you see anything
down on those streets?

18:28.309 --> 18:29.743
Traffic. Nothing special.

18:29.777 --> 18:30.944
Rick, can you hear me?

18:30.978 --> 18:32.012
- Rick? Rick...
- Hey... h-hello?

18:32.046 --> 18:34.748
Jules-Jules. Jules!

18:34.782 --> 18:35.849
What just happened?

18:35.883 --> 18:36.983
It could've lost juice.

18:37.018 --> 18:38.418
Or hit a dead zone.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.653
Maybe dish interference.

18:39.687 --> 18:41.087
There's a lot of studios in the area.

18:41.122 --> 18:42.689
Yeah, or we spooked them
with the helicopter.

18:42.723 --> 18:44.024
Hey, hey, hey.

18:44.058 --> 18:45.692
You taught her how to stay alive.

18:45.726 --> 18:47.360
So far, it's working.

18:47.395 --> 18:50.630
This is 20-David to Air 17,
we've lost contact.

18:50.665 --> 18:51.831
Do you see any activity?

18:51.866 --> 18:53.366
Negative.

18:53.401 --> 18:55.702
We need to break off, we're low on fuel.

18:55.736 --> 18:56.937
Roger that. Thank you.

18:56.971 --> 18:59.472
Air 17 out.

18:59.507 --> 19:01.841
Man, I never should have
let her go to that club.

19:01.876 --> 19:03.843
But all she ever hears is "no."

19:03.878 --> 19:05.645
She loves to dance.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.880
Does she know how you feel about her?

19:09.483 --> 19:12.485
Come on, man, it's pretty damn obvious.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.155
Maybe to you. Not to her.

19:15.189 --> 19:17.157
She's a client, there's boundaries.

19:17.191 --> 19:18.992
And I know you've been
doing everything you can

19:19.026 --> 19:20.727
- not to make any mistakes.
- Any <i>more</i> mistakes.

19:20.761 --> 19:23.163
I already screwed up,
I let her get grabbed.

19:23.197 --> 19:25.398
Now I'm sidelined with this thing?

19:25.433 --> 19:27.033
Granger's not running a charity.

19:27.068 --> 19:28.468
He knows we're grateful for the job,

19:28.502 --> 19:29.903
but you either work or you're out.

19:30.694 --> 19:32.872
The prints lifted from the motel room...

19:32.907 --> 19:34.908
we got a hit on a set from an open case.

19:34.942 --> 19:37.243
The defendant used to work
for Granger Protection.

19:37.278 --> 19:38.912
Do you know Tom Russell?

19:38.946 --> 19:41.181
Not personally, but I
sure know who he is.

19:41.215 --> 19:42.382
Everybody at the company
knows about Russell.

19:42.416 --> 19:43.984
Army vet.

19:44.018 --> 19:46.186
He got fired after he tore
his ACL on the clock.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.154
That was enough to make him famous?

19:48.189 --> 19:51.758
No, he sued Granger for wrongful
termination, then lost.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.551
I heard he started drinking heavy.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.637
Wait, that's who grabbed Juliette?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.639
Why?

19:59.664 --> 20:02.766
Five million bucks and a chance
to humiliate his ex-boss.

20:02.791 --> 20:04.854
Can the parents even pay the money?

20:05.439 --> 20:06.706
They have insurance.

20:06.741 --> 20:07.774
Kidnap insurance?

20:07.808 --> 20:10.243
K&R, kidnap and ransom.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.013
It's part of Granger's package
for his premium clients.

20:13.047 --> 20:15.081
So, then, who pays the ransom?

20:15.116 --> 20:17.183
It's self-funded, the company does.

20:17.218 --> 20:19.419
That means Granger does.

20:19.453 --> 20:21.955
What if this wasn't about Juliette?

20:21.989 --> 20:23.957
What if Granger was the actual target?

20:23.991 --> 20:26.292
Could put him right out of business.

20:26.327 --> 20:27.761
Look, Tom was a good man.

20:27.795 --> 20:28.962
He's been through hell.

20:28.996 --> 20:30.697
I-I was very sorry he got hurt.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.532
But it wasn't my fault.

20:32.566 --> 20:33.867
You know, he-he had no case against me.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.435
He lost every motion every time

20:35.469 --> 20:37.103
because he was an independent contractor.

20:37.138 --> 20:38.772
Like all my guys. Like Rick.

20:38.806 --> 20:40.573
No unemployment benefits,
no workman's comp.

20:40.608 --> 20:42.042
And no taxes withheld.

20:42.076 --> 20:43.977
I-It's a good business model
for both sides.

20:44.011 --> 20:45.478
- Unknown.
- Huh?

20:45.513 --> 20:46.780
This is Rick.

20:46.814 --> 20:47.947
It's her.

20:47.982 --> 20:49.503
Mark! Gina!

20:49.537 --> 20:50.984
Your parents are coming.
Are you all right?

20:51.018 --> 20:52.733
Anybody hurt you?

20:52.767 --> 20:53.867
Put her on speaker, Rick.

20:53.892 --> 20:54.954
They found the other phone on me.

20:54.989 --> 20:56.423
They know I was talking to you.

20:56.457 --> 20:58.391
Okay, okay, your parents are here.

20:58.426 --> 21:00.593
I'm supposed to say you're all
responsible for what happens

21:00.628 --> 21:02.429
- to me next.
- Okay, okay.

21:02.463 --> 21:04.097
We're gonna do whatever they tell us.

21:04.131 --> 21:06.299
- Mommy?
- I love you, baby. I love you so much.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.069
Let's just figure out
how to get you back.

21:09.103 --> 21:10.629
I'm supposed to say you disobeyed orders.

21:10.663 --> 21:11.938
You called the police.

21:11.972 --> 21:13.343
No, no, no, no.

21:13.377 --> 21:15.442
They shot up a nightclub.

21:15.476 --> 21:17.310
Everybody called the police.

21:22.516 --> 21:24.150
I'm supposed to say you now only have

21:24.185 --> 21:25.919
four hours to...

21:25.953 --> 21:27.687
buy my life.

21:27.722 --> 21:30.523
Okay. Okay. Where?

21:30.558 --> 21:32.092
I'm supposed to say I'll call
you back for the transfer,

21:32.126 --> 21:33.960
but first you need
to get rid of all the police.

21:33.994 --> 21:36.429
I'm supposed to say that's
nonnegotiable, so please,

21:36.464 --> 21:39.933
please just listen to them.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.835
Just do what they s...

21:41.870 --> 21:44.170
Is there any reason she kept
repeating "I'm supposed to say"?

21:44.205 --> 21:45.338
It's code I taught her.

21:45.372 --> 21:47.040
It means they're listening
to both sides of the call,

21:47.074 --> 21:48.322
so don't try to give her
private instructions.

21:48.356 --> 21:51.010
Y-You heard what she said. You're fired.

21:51.045 --> 21:52.612
Phil, make them leave.

21:52.646 --> 21:54.180
No, no, Gina, you can't fire
SWAT. You don't want to.

21:54.215 --> 21:55.882
They have technical
resources I don't have.

21:55.916 --> 21:58.218
So far all you've done is put
our girl at more risk.

21:58.252 --> 22:00.453
You're not required
to cooperate, Mrs. Carlton,

22:00.488 --> 22:02.322
but we are your best way
of getting her back safe.

22:02.356 --> 22:03.690
Unless you're wrong.

22:04.859 --> 22:06.326
This is private property.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.582
I want them out of the house.

22:09.050 --> 22:10.764
We're leaving.

22:15.875 --> 22:17.509
They're betting with lousy cards.

22:17.543 --> 22:18.910
They have the right.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.981
Hey.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.584
You're not actually quitting, are you?

22:26.619 --> 22:28.019
No.

22:28.054 --> 22:29.554
Just gonna leave the premises.

22:29.588 --> 22:32.257
Hey, uh, you're either with
them or you're with us,

22:32.291 --> 22:34.059
but, uh, make your choice, huh, Rick?

22:34.093 --> 22:35.462
Yes, sir.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.625
Rick, he's not your only choice.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.817
That's a longer discussion.

22:41.934 --> 22:43.035
Which we should have when this is over.

22:47.573 --> 22:49.274
It's Hondo.

22:49.308 --> 22:51.443
The Army vet who sued Granger,
Tom Russell,

22:51.477 --> 22:53.044
well, our friend in GND just came through

22:53.079 --> 22:54.479
with his last known address in Echo Park,

22:54.513 --> 22:56.081
not far from Juliette's last location

22:56.115 --> 22:57.382
when the phone failed.

22:57.416 --> 22:58.622
All right, she could be there.

22:58.656 --> 23:00.618
We don't need a warrant.
There's immediate danger.

23:00.653 --> 23:02.787
I'm sending coordinates
and aerial photos now.

23:02.822 --> 23:05.557
- First good news of the day.
- You know it.

23:05.591 --> 23:08.226
Deacon, we got a hit on Russell.

23:08.260 --> 23:10.228
Get with the team, get 'em up to speed

23:10.262 --> 23:11.496
while I get eyes on his place.

23:11.530 --> 23:12.931
Meet me there.

23:20.051 --> 23:22.186
Rocker says the guy
is still paying alimony

23:22.211 --> 23:24.412
to all three of his ex-wives.
How does that even happen?

23:24.437 --> 23:26.438
I don't understand why Mumford
always needs to get married.

23:26.463 --> 23:27.830
I mean, he should just live with them.

23:27.855 --> 23:29.689
Things work until they don't.

23:29.714 --> 23:31.882
That's my mantra. Travel light, Luca?

23:31.907 --> 23:33.341
Hey, keeps it from getting messy.

23:33.366 --> 23:34.533
You're still sleeping on my couch

23:34.558 --> 23:35.891
five months after your last girlfriend

23:35.916 --> 23:37.783
kicked you out. Trust me, it's messy.

23:37.808 --> 23:39.942
You know, Mumford's a junkie for women.

23:40.292 --> 23:41.493
Deac, you remember his ex?

23:41.527 --> 23:42.927
Yeah, number three and number two.

23:42.962 --> 23:45.130
- Guy's got a type.
- I can imagine.

23:45.164 --> 23:46.931
Yeah, my gramps went
to his first wedding.

23:46.966 --> 23:48.756
My dad went to his second and third.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.579
I guess I'll have to keep
up the family tradition

23:50.614 --> 23:52.027
and dance at his fourth.

23:52.061 --> 23:53.333
Yeah, well, who says
this is where it ends?

23:53.367 --> 23:55.273
Elizabeth Taylor got married eight times.

23:55.307 --> 23:57.008
We should do a background
check on this one.

23:57.042 --> 23:58.128
Make sure he's not getting played again.

23:58.163 --> 24:00.712
- That's cold, Chris.
- Not a bad idea, though.

24:31.377 --> 24:32.777
Position Two set.

24:35.581 --> 24:38.082
Position One set.

24:38.117 --> 24:39.417
On three.

24:39.452 --> 24:41.619
One, two, three.

24:43.389 --> 24:45.390
LAPD, SWAT! Hands behind your back!

24:45.424 --> 24:46.758
Give me a two, give me a two!

24:46.792 --> 24:48.679
Give me a two, give me a two.

24:49.361 --> 24:52.230
My baby is in there. He's alone in there.

24:52.264 --> 24:54.432
Luca, go.

24:54.467 --> 24:55.533
Left side clear!

24:55.568 --> 24:57.235
Right side clear!

24:57.269 --> 24:59.904
- Luca.
- Two, two!

24:59.939 --> 25:01.539
- Two!
- It's clear.

25:01.574 --> 25:02.674
Deacon out.

25:02.708 --> 25:03.708
Straight out.

25:03.742 --> 25:05.743
- It's all clear.
- Luca out.

25:08.481 --> 25:10.325
I got this.

25:11.116 --> 25:13.551
Where's Tom?

25:13.586 --> 25:15.019
He doesn't live here anymore.

25:15.054 --> 25:16.020
There you go. Shh.

25:16.055 --> 25:17.255
Shh, shh, shh.

25:17.289 --> 25:19.224
Kids love me.

25:20.365 --> 25:23.234
- Let her go, Chris.
- You okay?

25:24.047 --> 25:25.563
What did Tom do now?

25:25.598 --> 25:27.298
When was the last time you saw him?

25:27.333 --> 25:28.900
In the delivery room.

25:28.934 --> 25:30.902
He was more lit than I was,
and I'd had an epidural.

25:30.936 --> 25:33.438
I wasn't going to bring
the baby home to that.

25:33.472 --> 25:35.974
He started drinking again
after he got hurt.

25:36.008 --> 25:37.782
- Did he have a problem before?
- The Army got him sober.

25:37.817 --> 25:39.741
Kept him sober.

25:39.775 --> 25:42.080
All it took was one drink
to undo all his hard work.

25:42.114 --> 25:43.465
He never went back on a program?

25:43.499 --> 25:46.417
Sure. The VA, AA, church.

25:46.452 --> 25:49.593
Nothing stuck, except
for his party buddies.

25:49.628 --> 25:52.080
You're not gonna tell me
why you broke into my house?

25:52.081 --> 25:53.849
We'll send a crew to fix the damage.

25:53.883 --> 25:54.983
Tom's a suspect in a shooting

25:55.017 --> 25:56.151
that occurred last night in Hollywood.

25:56.185 --> 25:57.919
- The thing at the nightclub?
- That's right.

25:57.954 --> 26:00.088
Any help you can give us?

26:00.959 --> 26:03.425
Uh, I heard he's back
at the Sober Sanctuary.

26:03.459 --> 26:05.160
Part of his probation.

26:05.194 --> 26:06.561
What a joke.

26:06.596 --> 26:09.343
Best place to find trouble
is at a halfway house.

26:17.684 --> 26:19.241
Guess the halfway house

26:19.275 --> 26:21.343
is all the way out of business.

26:21.377 --> 26:23.578
We need to catch a break.

26:23.613 --> 26:25.013
This would be a great place to hide

26:25.047 --> 26:27.549
with a secure perimeter already in place.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.656
What? Right there.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.053
That little bit of light
on the edge of the window

26:32.088 --> 26:34.256
on the second floor just came on.

26:34.997 --> 26:36.998
Bootleg wiring?

26:39.729 --> 26:41.229
Someone's here who shouldn't be.

26:41.264 --> 26:42.542
Gear up.

28:08.818 --> 28:10.719
Goggles.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.842
Lights.

28:16.092 --> 28:18.159
- We good?
- Mm-hmm.

28:26.902 --> 28:28.290
Come on.

28:28.325 --> 28:29.704
Just have some more.

29:02.772 --> 29:04.105
Metro SWAT!

29:04.140 --> 29:05.106
Turn around! Face down!

29:05.141 --> 29:06.908
Turn around! Get on the ground!

29:06.942 --> 29:08.877
- Go, go, go! Move, move, move!
- Give me a two, give me a two!

29:08.911 --> 29:11.212
- Down on the ground! Runner!
- I'm Code 4, Chris!

29:11.247 --> 29:13.648
Metro SWAT!

29:19.120 --> 29:21.155
Chris, go right. I got left.

29:22.625 --> 29:23.792
Clear!

29:23.826 --> 29:26.824
Hey. Just stay down.

29:26.859 --> 29:27.962
I got you.

29:29.739 --> 29:31.299
- Where's Rick?
- He's good.

29:40.910 --> 29:42.744
This is 20-David to Air 17.

29:42.778 --> 29:45.680
Suspect heading up to the roof,
Side Three.

30:04.668 --> 30:07.173
20-David to Air 17,
what do you see down here?

30:07.174 --> 30:10.143
Air 17 to 20-David,
suspect is behind a roof vent

30:10.177 --> 30:12.011
street side of your position,
near the parapet.

30:12.046 --> 30:14.013
Be advised, suspect is armed.

30:14.048 --> 30:16.249
You're right on him.

30:16.283 --> 30:18.151
20-David to 24-David,

30:18.185 --> 30:19.352
Chris, cover me by the door.

30:19.386 --> 30:20.920
Do not come out.

30:20.955 --> 30:23.223
24-David, holding in place.

30:26.060 --> 30:27.827
20-David to Air 17,

30:27.861 --> 30:30.263
give me some altitude.

30:30.297 --> 30:31.698
Air 17, roger that.

30:38.612 --> 30:40.640
Tom!

30:40.674 --> 30:42.508
We can play hide-and-seek
up here for a while,

30:42.543 --> 30:45.211
or we can save some time
and call it a night.

30:45.246 --> 30:47.252
You're thinking if you can just get over

30:47.277 --> 30:49.478
to that other stairwell hatch
you got a chance, but you don't.

30:49.512 --> 30:51.213
Play it through, man.

30:51.247 --> 30:53.499
SWAT's got every exit covered

30:53.533 --> 30:55.417
and the block is locked down.

30:55.452 --> 30:57.753
Your crew ain't coming for you, man.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.689
I know your knee's got to be hurting,

31:00.723 --> 31:01.890
keeping it bent like that.

31:02.844 --> 31:04.526
It doesn't matter anymore.

31:04.561 --> 31:06.829
30-David to 20-David,

31:06.863 --> 31:09.164
three suspects secured, hostage is safe.

31:09.199 --> 31:10.866
We're on our way up
the back stairs to meet you.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.334
This is 20-David to 30-David.

31:12.368 --> 31:13.936
I am trying to negotiate.

31:13.970 --> 31:16.538
Stand down by the stairwell.
Wait for my signal.

31:16.573 --> 31:19.074
30-David, roger that.

31:25.315 --> 31:27.282
Tom, you didn't make it
out of Afghanistan

31:27.317 --> 31:29.284
just to die on a roof in Hollywood.

31:32.165 --> 31:36.043
I used to come up here a lot
when the place was still open.

31:36.077 --> 31:38.360
Nobody around to bother me.

31:38.394 --> 31:39.895
I wasn't gonna hurt the girl.

31:39.929 --> 31:42.030
I'm not the one that shot the bodyguard.

31:42.065 --> 31:44.533
There wasn't supposed to be
any collateral damage.

31:44.567 --> 31:45.634
I believe you.

31:45.668 --> 31:47.202
No, you don't.

31:47.237 --> 31:48.437
Or the body count would've been higher.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.138
I believe you, man.

31:50.173 --> 31:53.308
You only wanted to hurt
Phil Granger, am I right?

31:54.729 --> 31:57.613
All you see is the big smile
with the fake teeth,

31:57.647 --> 31:59.414
as fake as the rest of him.

31:59.449 --> 32:00.983
He is a slick salesman,
I'll give you that.

32:01.017 --> 32:02.784
He tells you what he's gonna do for you,

32:02.819 --> 32:06.722
why you should be thankful,
how he only hires vets,

32:06.756 --> 32:08.257
no questions asked.

32:08.291 --> 32:10.826
Like that makes him the hero, right?

32:10.860 --> 32:12.928
Because companies don't want
to give a second chance

32:12.962 --> 32:15.030
to somebody who actually needs it.

32:17.033 --> 32:19.045
So now you're cheap.

32:20.803 --> 32:22.343
And you're disposable.

32:23.572 --> 32:24.840
You can't even complain

32:24.874 --> 32:27.676
when he screws you over
'cause you signed a contract.

32:28.096 --> 32:29.931
It's just business.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.915
How many times have
I heard him say that in court?

32:32.949 --> 32:34.983
And you just wanted to put him
out of business. I get it.

32:35.018 --> 32:36.948
- He owed me.
- Okay.

32:36.982 --> 32:40.758
He owed you, Loulou, and Tommy Jr.

32:40.793 --> 32:41.857
That's right.

32:41.891 --> 32:45.363
I got Army buddies off the grid
in Costa Rica waiting for us.

32:46.529 --> 32:49.598
There's a hotel by the beach
we were gonna buy, all cash.

32:49.632 --> 32:51.083
And Loulou was down with that, huh?

32:51.619 --> 32:54.536
Nah, man. She didn't know
anything about it yet.

32:54.571 --> 32:56.541
I just wanted to take care of my family.

32:58.341 --> 33:00.211
Tom, you were in Kandahar, weren't you?

33:01.644 --> 33:04.448
Yes, sir. Fourth Infantry.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.781
I was in Somalia.

33:05.815 --> 33:08.094
First Battalion, Ninth Marines.

33:09.052 --> 33:11.181
Civilians don't get it.

33:11.821 --> 33:14.122
We make 'em nervous, man.

33:14.157 --> 33:15.691
Sure, they thank you for your service,

33:15.725 --> 33:17.826
but then they want to know
what you've done.

33:17.860 --> 33:20.028
They want to know how many
people you've killed.

33:20.063 --> 33:21.630
They don't understand us.

33:21.664 --> 33:24.027
You died there, is what you did.

33:24.934 --> 33:27.169
- Part of you, anyway.
- But you also learned

33:27.203 --> 33:29.871
the value of life... tell me I'm wrong.

33:29.906 --> 33:31.974
I know the technique
you're using. Just stop it.

33:32.008 --> 33:34.009
Because every minute you breathe

33:34.043 --> 33:37.245
is a minute a buddy would love
to have for himself.

33:37.832 --> 33:41.350
Vets like us, we do not have
the right to throw that away.

33:41.384 --> 33:44.005
We owe the dead.

33:45.054 --> 33:46.788
Do you hear me, soldier?

33:48.591 --> 33:50.525
Why do people always count to three?

33:50.560 --> 33:52.494
No! Tom, don't do this. You have a son.

33:52.528 --> 33:53.495
One.

33:53.529 --> 33:55.703
You have a woman who cares about you.

33:55.738 --> 33:58.533
Family is worth living for.
However, wherever!

33:58.568 --> 33:59.868
Two.

33:59.902 --> 34:02.104
Tom, there is no shame in
staying alive and fighting, man.

34:02.138 --> 34:03.420
Don't do this.

34:03.454 --> 34:05.107
Three.

34:15.664 --> 34:17.465
Now you know what a coward I am.

34:18.359 --> 34:19.791
No.

34:20.489 --> 34:22.835
I don't think you're a coward.

34:24.212 --> 34:27.496
I think you love your family
too much to leave 'em like this.

34:29.998 --> 34:32.801
The bravest thing for us is
to own what we've done.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.333
All of it.

34:36.187 --> 34:37.806
Come on, man.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.875
Show me.

34:39.909 --> 34:42.411
You show me what bravery
really looks like.

34:44.746 --> 34:46.447
Show me, Tom.

35:04.961 --> 35:08.070
Let me see your hands.
Show me your hands.

35:08.104 --> 35:09.549
Down on the ground, face down.

35:18.713 --> 35:20.947
What's your name?

35:23.026 --> 35:25.027
Hondo.

35:27.336 --> 35:30.138
This is 20-David to Air 17
and all D-Team units.

35:31.154 --> 35:34.463
Code 4. Suspect is in custody.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.850
Hey, Rick.

35:46.209 --> 35:47.542
Thank you.

35:53.209 --> 35:54.710
You saved me.

35:55.852 --> 35:58.349
<i>- They</i> saved you.
- You got shot.

35:58.384 --> 36:00.322
You could have died for me.

36:00.356 --> 36:02.357
I'm right here.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.662
I look terrible.

36:07.697 --> 36:10.265
You always say that,
and you're always wrong.

36:18.576 --> 36:21.743
My parents... just got here.

36:21.778 --> 36:23.311
Hey.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.580
Oh, baby.

36:26.682 --> 36:29.084
So, uh, they asked me to
apologize to both of you

36:29.118 --> 36:30.085
on their behalf.

36:30.119 --> 36:31.553
Phil, how hard would it be

36:31.587 --> 36:33.255
to just take care of your employees?

36:33.289 --> 36:34.393
Oh, so you're blaming me now?

36:34.427 --> 36:36.324
Workers' comp? Injury leave?

36:36.359 --> 36:39.094
Okay, um, I'm gonna drive
my clients home now.

36:39.128 --> 36:40.695
Thanks for doing your civic job.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.764
Oh, and, you know, um,
you'll always be employees

36:42.799 --> 36:45.400
if you can't understand economics, so...

36:46.896 --> 36:49.273
I'm gonna need a shower
to wash the sleaze off.

36:52.575 --> 36:55.076
You know Patty Hearst married
her bodyguard, right?

36:59.549 --> 37:00.615
Happy ever after.

37:00.650 --> 37:01.950
You gonna share that with Rick?

37:01.984 --> 37:03.985
Think I might.

37:08.224 --> 37:11.026
You know nobody's blind
around here, right?

37:11.060 --> 37:13.028
Come on, man.

37:13.062 --> 37:15.030
If she's your ride-or-die,
why don't you just go ahead

37:15.064 --> 37:16.264
and make that happen?

37:16.299 --> 37:18.200
Doesn't come around too often.

37:18.234 --> 37:20.096
You got one of those?

37:22.015 --> 37:23.738
You're looking at it.

37:23.773 --> 37:25.907
Kill for, die for.

37:25.942 --> 37:29.144
SWAT is exactly what I needed
when I left the Marines.

37:29.178 --> 37:32.280
Yeah, I thought about becoming
a cop after I got out.

37:32.315 --> 37:35.550
Like you, higher purpose, but...

37:35.585 --> 37:37.986
My sergeant buddy said that you
didn't get charged for that incident.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.922
Well, an MP arrest still
goes on your military record.

37:40.957 --> 37:42.791
Sarge says that lieutenant
deserved a fist in his face.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.492
Eh, a butter bar who thought
he was all that.

37:44.527 --> 37:46.127
He had a girl up against
the wall, copping a feel

37:46.162 --> 37:47.662
she sure as hell didn't want.

37:47.697 --> 37:50.732
In uniform. Nothing happened to him.

37:50.766 --> 37:52.968
Except your one-hitter quitter.

37:53.421 --> 37:54.736
- Right.
- Right.

37:54.770 --> 37:56.805
But assault on a superior
officer isn't exactly

37:56.839 --> 37:59.341
the way into the police
academy, so... that's that.

37:59.375 --> 38:00.675
Rick, there was a time in my life

38:00.710 --> 38:02.344
when I needed a second chance.

38:02.378 --> 38:03.845
Just running around,
looking for a righteous fight.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.814
- Sounds familiar.
- Right.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.315
Well, listen, if you think
you still want a life

38:07.350 --> 38:09.584
in public service, I might
be able to help you out.

38:09.619 --> 38:11.119
Yeah, how?

38:11.153 --> 38:13.255
I can recommend you
personally to the Academy.

38:13.289 --> 38:16.625
I've worked with you now,
and I've seen your dedication.

38:16.659 --> 38:19.427
I know you'd be an asset to the force.

38:20.072 --> 38:21.963
Semper fi.

38:21.998 --> 38:23.965
All the way.

38:27.069 --> 38:29.037
- The man's hopeless.
- More like helpless.

38:29.071 --> 38:30.972
The graphics are nice.
She put in some work.

38:31.007 --> 38:34.109
Did you hear Mumford's
getting married again?

38:34.143 --> 38:37.145
Talk about a slow learner.
Has anybody met her?

38:37.179 --> 38:38.480
He's barely met her.

38:38.514 --> 38:39.714
Says he's only known her a month.

38:39.749 --> 38:41.883
Me and Street ran
a criminal background on her.

38:41.918 --> 38:43.885
DMV, R&I, National Database...

38:43.920 --> 38:45.520
Wait, you did what?

38:45.554 --> 38:47.455
- It was Chris' idea.
- Snitch.

38:47.490 --> 38:48.890
Find anything?

38:48.925 --> 38:50.191
Nikki came back clean.

38:50.226 --> 38:52.814
- Yeah, like not even an unpaid ticket.
- Heads up.

38:53.529 --> 38:54.963
Background check.

38:54.997 --> 38:57.032
Man, there's something
seriously wrong with all of you.

38:57.066 --> 38:58.466
Just trying to look out for you.

38:58.501 --> 39:00.502
Is happiness so hard
for you dopes to imagine?

39:00.536 --> 39:01.903
Anybody can be a cynic.

39:01.938 --> 39:03.838
That's the default mode.

39:03.873 --> 39:05.540
He's the only one of all of you

39:05.574 --> 39:07.309
who had the guts to get married
for the first time.

39:07.343 --> 39:09.077
That's one point of view.

39:09.111 --> 39:13.048
Look, all I know is, I love
this woman, and she loves me.

39:13.082 --> 39:16.251
And I hope that you'll come
and celebrate with us.

39:16.285 --> 39:18.965
Or... the hell with you.

39:20.383 --> 39:22.390
And I'll have known her for
two months by then, Deacon.

39:22.425 --> 39:23.658
Just to be clear.

39:23.693 --> 39:24.693
Hey, look, Mumford.

39:24.727 --> 39:26.761
Like you said, if it's right it's right.

39:26.796 --> 39:29.097
But I just want you to
rethink your timetable.

39:29.131 --> 39:31.533
- Why?
- Weddings are stressful.

39:31.567 --> 39:33.145
No, divorces are stressful.

39:35.304 --> 39:37.605
All right, you know what,
I expected some attitude,

39:37.640 --> 39:40.175
so I asked her to pick me up from work.

39:40.209 --> 39:41.376
She's here?

39:41.410 --> 39:44.846
Any minute. Just meet her...

39:44.880 --> 39:47.869
before you make up your minds. Okay.

39:58.327 --> 40:01.841
So, this is, uh... awkward.

40:03.050 --> 40:05.567
Got to admit, the suspense is killing me.

40:13.309 --> 40:14.409
Is he punking us?

40:14.443 --> 40:16.911
- Huh.
- Come on.

40:16.946 --> 40:19.180
They'll love you. Don't worry about it.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.651
Hey. I'd like you all to meet

40:23.686 --> 40:26.154
Nikki almost-Mumford, my bride to be.

40:26.188 --> 40:28.656
Jack's mentioned all of you.

40:28.691 --> 40:29.891
Jessica, right?

40:29.925 --> 40:31.059
How do you do?

40:31.093 --> 40:32.727
- Chris?
- Nikki, nice to meet you.

40:32.762 --> 40:34.796
- Street.
- Hi. Pleasure, ma'am.

40:34.830 --> 40:37.632
Oh, now I feel old. Luca.

40:37.666 --> 40:39.372
Oh, yeah. Roger that.
Pleased to meet you.

40:39.407 --> 40:40.636
- Tan.
- Lots of happiness.

40:40.661 --> 40:41.869
Oh, your mom trained you right.

40:41.903 --> 40:43.620
No congratulating the bride. Deacon.

40:43.655 --> 40:44.740
Hi, Nikki.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.141
And I recognize Hondo.

40:46.175 --> 40:47.275
Truly my pleasure.

40:47.309 --> 40:48.743
Jack told me that

40:48.778 --> 40:51.513
marrying a SWAT officer is marrying SWAT.

40:51.547 --> 40:53.615
So I'm happy to meet
all my future in-laws

40:53.649 --> 40:55.150
before the wedding.

40:55.184 --> 40:57.318
We got to go. We're gonna be late.

40:57.353 --> 40:58.753
Where-where you headed?

40:58.788 --> 41:01.256
The opera. My-my first time.

41:01.290 --> 41:02.991
That's so crazy to me,

41:03.025 --> 41:05.277
for a man with such a beautiful
singing voice himself.

41:05.312 --> 41:07.095
- What?
- He's gonna love it.

41:07.129 --> 41:09.764
A singing voice? You can sing?

41:09.799 --> 41:11.366
- Yeah.
- Oh...

41:11.400 --> 41:12.500
I didn't know that.

41:12.535 --> 41:13.535
Well, you never asked.

41:13.569 --> 41:15.562
He has an amazing tenor range.

41:15.596 --> 41:17.205
One month.

41:17.239 --> 41:19.474
One month, and Nikki knows more about me

41:19.508 --> 41:21.587
than the rest of you heroes put together.

41:22.244 --> 41:23.445
Deacon's been trying to get me

41:23.479 --> 41:25.947
to rethink our timetable.

41:26.592 --> 41:29.684
You know what? I have.

41:31.487 --> 41:34.522
Why the hell do we have
to wait a whole month, Nikki?

41:34.557 --> 41:36.057
Vegas is five hours away.

41:36.092 --> 41:38.226
We can leave right after the curtain,

41:38.260 --> 41:39.772
and-and, look, we're dressed already.

41:41.831 --> 41:43.231
I would love that, Jack.

41:43.265 --> 41:46.701
We have a full tank of gas,
couple of credit cards.

41:46.735 --> 41:48.837
All right, you don't need these.

41:48.871 --> 41:51.639
All right? Gifts are still
being accepted.

41:54.161 --> 41:55.643
See you Tuesday, suckers.

42:05.131 --> 42:06.654
She's really great.

42:06.689 --> 42:08.022
She's amazing.

42:08.057 --> 42:11.426
Only took three divorces, but I
guess he finally figured it out.

42:13.028 --> 42:15.864
Feel bad now... for running
the background check?

42:15.898 --> 42:18.166
Yeah. I actually do.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.567
I think we should have
warned her about him.
