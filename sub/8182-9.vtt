HEY!

BABY, THAT FACE IS REALLY

00:25.074 --> 00:28.209
GOING TO SET US BACK
IN THE BEDROOM.

00:29.845 --> 00:31.046
SORRY, I'M JUST,

00:31.113 --> 00:33.414
YOU KNOW, MY HIGH SCHOOL
REUNION, I'M PUMPED.

00:33.482 --> 00:34.282
YEAH, I NOTICED THAT

00:34.350 --> 00:37.269
WHEN YOU KARATE-KICKED
MY MAKEUP MIRROR.

00:37.336 --> 00:38.369
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S THE WAY I WAS

00:38.437 --> 00:39.370
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:39.438 --> 00:41.139
I HUNG WITH
A PRETTY ROUGH CROWD.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.975
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF TONIGHT
YOU GET A CALL FROM THE COPS.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.561
OH, WHY? IS IT ILLEGAL
TO WEAR STONEWASHED?

00:47.997 --> 00:49.363
ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE'S LASHING OUT

00:49.431 --> 00:52.834
'CAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE
INSECURE ABOUT ME GOING STAG.

00:52.902 --> 00:54.753
NO, HONEY, I WANT YOU TO
HAVE A GOOD TIME, ALL RIGHT.

00:54.820 --> 00:58.156
I JUST WANT TO RENT A
MOVIE TONIGHT AND RELAX.

00:58.224 --> 01:02.627
ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE
PLAYING WITH FIRE,

01:02.694 --> 01:03.862
'CAUSE A LOT OF THESE LADIES

01:03.929 --> 01:07.966
HAVEN'T SEEN THE MACHINERY
IN A WHILE.

01:08.033 --> 01:08.783
MM-HMM.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.119
DID YOU TAKE
YOUR LACTOSE PILL?

01:11.187 --> 01:12.687
NO, NOT YET.

01:12.754 --> 01:14.355
OK.
I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

01:52.478 --> 01:53.811
WHAT?

01:53.879 --> 01:55.846
TALK TO ME ABOUT
THE HAIR, WOODRUFF.

01:55.914 --> 01:56.648
AW, COME-

01:56.799 --> 01:57.999
<i>ACCORDING TO COSMO MEN,</i>

01:58.067 --> 02:00.835
THIS LOOK IS ALL OVER
EUROPE RIGHT NOW.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.303
YEAH.

02:02.371 --> 02:04.973
ONE MORE REASON
NOT TO GO TO EUROPE.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.007
OH, BY THE WAY,
SPENCE,

02:06.075 --> 02:07.108
IF I HOOK UP

02:11.847 --> 02:13.514
AND YOU HAVE TO SLEEP
SOMEWHERE ELSE

02:13.582 --> 02:15.116
PER OUR AGREEMENT?

02:15.184 --> 02:16.384
'CAUSE I SAID IT FIRST,
I GOT DIBS.

02:16.452 --> 02:17.335
NO, YOU CAN'T CALL DIBS.

02:17.453 --> 02:18.619
I PAY HALF THE RENT.

02:18.687 --> 02:19.287
SO WHAT? I-

02:26.462 --> 02:28.146
WELL, YEAH.

02:30.599 --> 02:31.666
EXCUSE ME,

02:31.733 --> 02:33.401
WHERE IS YOUR
V.H.S. SECTION?

02:33.469 --> 02:35.136
UH, RIGHT OVER THERE.

02:35.203 --> 02:37.622
THAT'S IT?

02:37.690 --> 02:39.924
THAT'S THE ONLY TAPES
YOU HAVE?

02:39.991 --> 02:43.945
ONE FOR EVERY PERSON
WHO STILL HAS A V.C.R.

02:44.012 --> 02:46.648
WAIT, I KNOW YOU.

02:46.715 --> 02:49.050
AREN'T YOU THE OLD MAN
THAT GOT ME FIRED

02:49.117 --> 02:50.752
FROM THE JAVA HUT?

02:50.820 --> 02:53.304
DOESN'T RING A BELL,
BUT YOU DO LOOK LIKE

02:53.372 --> 02:55.607
A PERSON
WHO MIGHT ANNOY ME.

02:55.674 --> 02:58.710
YOU KNOW, IT TOOK ME
3 MONTHS TO FIND A NEW JOB.

02:58.777 --> 03:00.044
I HAD TO GO ON WELFARE.

03:00.112 --> 03:02.797
WELL, YOU'VE MADE QUITE
THE COMEBACK, EXCUSE ME.

03:09.404 --> 03:10.571
DAD?

03:10.639 --> 03:11.923
OH, HELLO, DARLING.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.725
HEY, IT'S FUNNY
RUNNING INTO YOU HERE.

03:14.793 --> 03:16.727
JUST RENTING A MOVIE
TO WATCH TONIGHT.

03:16.795 --> 03:17.795
OH, YEAH, ME TOO.

03:17.863 --> 03:19.914
SINCE I DON'T HAVE

03:19.981 --> 03:22.983
A DIGITAL VD PLAYER
IN MY ROOM,

03:23.051 --> 03:25.586
THE SELECTIONS
ARE PRETTY SPARSE.

03:25.654 --> 03:26.755
WELL, HEY, I ENVY YOU,

03:26.822 --> 03:28.355
I MEAN, I HAVE
WAY TOO MANY CHOICES.

03:28.423 --> 03:29.557
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING,
RIGHT?

03:29.624 --> 03:31.359
MM-HMM.

03:33.962 --> 03:35.363
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

03:35.431 --> 03:36.364
MM-HMM.

03:42.604 --> 03:45.373
HEY, UM, DAD,
I WAS THINKING, UM,

03:45.440 --> 03:46.608
DO YOU WANT TO RENT
A MOVIE

03:46.675 --> 03:48.743
AND WATCH IT TOGETHER
TONIGHT?

03:48.811 --> 03:50.011
I'D LOVE TO.

03:50.079 --> 03:53.347
WE HAVEN'T SEEN A MOVIE TOGETHER
SINCE YOU WERE 8, REMEMBER?

03:53.415 --> 03:56.601
<i>DEATH WISH, YEAH.</i>

03:56.669 --> 04:00.055
WELL, THIS TIME MY LITTLE
GIRL PICKS ANY MOVIE SHE WANTS.

04:00.122 --> 04:01.172
OK, GOOD!

04:01.240 --> 04:02.440
LET'S SEE, UM,

04:02.508 --> 04:03.508
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

04:03.575 --> 04:06.410
<i>OH! HOW ABOUT, UH,
IN HER SHOES?</i>

04:06.478 --> 04:07.879
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE GOOD.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.129
VETO.

04:09.197 --> 04:10.431
WHY?

04:10.499 --> 04:12.851
BECAUSE IN 1987,
SHIRLEY MacLAINE

04:12.918 --> 04:15.219
CUT ME OFF IN LINE
AT THE RITE AID.

04:15.287 --> 04:17.120
I WILL NOT GIVE
THAT WOMAN A DIME,

04:17.189 --> 04:19.757
NOT IN ANY OF HER LIVES.

04:28.016 --> 04:28.766
HAVE FUN.

04:28.834 --> 04:31.018
WE GOT PLENTY
OF DRINKS.

04:31.087 --> 04:33.154
AND FOOD.

04:33.222 --> 04:35.123
AND FOOD? OH, YEAH,
I GET IT, I'M STILL BIG.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.008
YEAH, OK.

04:37.075 --> 04:40.812
MATTHEW KLEIN,
YOU SICK, SICK MAN!

04:40.880 --> 04:43.131
DOUG, GREAT TO SEE YOU!

04:43.198 --> 04:44.799
GOD, I FIGURED YOU'D
BE IN JAIL BY NOW.

04:44.866 --> 04:46.150
WELL, MIGHT AS WELL BE.

04:46.218 --> 04:48.502
MARRIAGE, AM I RIGHT?

04:48.570 --> 04:52.339
SO, HEY, DID YOU EVER END
UP DOING THAT STUNTMAN THING?

04:52.407 --> 04:53.257
OH, NO, NO, NO.

04:53.325 --> 04:54.909
I'M A STAY-AT-HOME DAD.

04:54.977 --> 04:56.911
BUT, YOU KNOW, WITH 3 LITTLE
MONSTERS RUNNING AROUND,

04:56.979 --> 04:59.213
THAT'S PRETTY DANGEROUS,
TOO.

05:00.132 --> 05:01.015
OK, MAN, LATER!

05:06.221 --> 05:07.621
SO, UH,

05:07.689 --> 05:09.824
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE DUCK
OUT OF HERE A LITTLE EARLY

05:09.891 --> 05:14.762
<i>AND GO BACK TO CASA DE DANNY
FOR A LITTLE POST-REUNION UNION?</i>

05:14.830 --> 05:17.048
NO, THANKS.

05:17.115 --> 05:17.865
OH, COME ON.

05:17.933 --> 05:18.883
I REMEMBER HOW YOU USED
TO STARE AT ME

05:18.951 --> 05:20.718
ALL THROUGH
BIOLOGY CLASS.

05:20.786 --> 05:24.438
ACTUALLY I WAS STARING
AT YOUR LAB PARTNER JAKE.

05:24.506 --> 05:26.874
HE'S MY HUSBAND NOW.

05:26.942 --> 05:28.192
HA HA HA!
YEAH.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.596
BOY, TALK ABOUT GOING A
LONG WAY TO MAKE ME JEALOUS.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.681
SO, ARE WE GOING
TO DO THIS OR WHAT?

05:36.285 --> 05:39.387
OH, AND I'M TOTALLY
ALLERGIC TO ANY KIND OF NUT.

05:39.454 --> 05:41.522
OH, ME-ME TOO.

05:41.590 --> 05:44.058
I HAVE A PICTURE OF MR.
PEANUT ON MY DARTBOARD.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.493
BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITH IT

05:45.560 --> 05:47.862
BECAUSE I'M ALSO
ALLERGIC TO DART FEATHERS.

05:47.929 --> 05:50.180
OH, I CAN TOP THAT.

05:50.248 --> 05:53.133
IF I EVEN SEE A BANANA,
I RUN SCREAMING.

05:53.201 --> 05:54.936
MAN, THAT'S SWELL.

05:55.004 --> 05:56.220
YOU KNOW,
I- I CAN'T BELIEVE

05:56.288 --> 05:58.656
WE WENT TO THE SAME HIGH
SCHOOL TOGETHER AND NEVER MET.

05:58.723 --> 06:01.476
YEAH, NOT EVEN IN
THE SPECIAL CAFETERIA.

06:02.845 --> 06:04.378
WELL, I'M, UM...

06:04.446 --> 06:07.815
I'M VERY GLAD
WE FINALLY MET TONIGHT.

06:07.883 --> 06:09.383
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:09.451 --> 06:11.652
I'M GOING TO GO TALK TO MY
FRIEND FOR JUST A SECOND,

06:11.720 --> 06:12.987
BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

06:13.055 --> 06:14.855
MMM, YOU BETTER BE.

06:19.478 --> 06:21.613
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS LAME.
READY TO GO TO IHOP?

06:21.680 --> 06:23.881
UH...

06:23.949 --> 06:27.334
ACTUALLY, I THINK I'M GOING
TO BE NEEDING THE APARTMENT.

06:28.421 --> 06:31.088
YEAH. SEE THAT CUTIE

MELINDA RAYBURN?

06:35.544 --> 06:36.744
MM-HMM.

06:36.812 --> 06:40.247
I REMEMBER HER. SHE-SHE
CAME OUT SENIOR YEAR.

06:40.315 --> 06:43.935
SHE CAME OUT?

06:44.003 --> 06:45.619
SHE'S GAY, SPENCE.

06:45.687 --> 06:47.338
ARE YOU CRAZY?

06:47.405 --> 06:50.408
SHE WORE A TUXEDO
TO THE PROM.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.909
AND SHE WENT
WITH A GIRL...

06:51.977 --> 06:55.647
WHO WORE A TUXEDO

06:58.751 --> 07:01.118

07:01.186 --> 07:04.122
OR MAYBE
SHE DOESN'T REALIZE

07:04.189 --> 07:06.824
SHE'S IN
THE MEN'S DEPARTMENT.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.159
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

07:08.226 --> 07:09.494

YOUR LEATHER

07:13.082 --> 07:16.283
AND YOUR LITTLE
FAUX-HAWK.

07:16.351 --> 07:18.152
MAYBE SHE GOT
THE WRONG IDEA, BRO.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.855
WAIT, ARE YOU

07:20.923 --> 07:23.023

08:45.073 --> 08:46.907
I DIDN'T SET HIM
ON FIRE.

08:46.975 --> 08:48.442
I SET A GARBAGE CAN

08:48.510 --> 08:51.512
HE CAUGHT FIRE TRYING

09:54.476 --> 09:56.294
WHY DIDN'T YOU LAUGH?

09:56.362 --> 09:58.045
BECAUSE YOU'RE KINDA
TELLING ME

09:58.113 --> 10:00.281
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
BEFORE IT HAPPENS,

10:00.348 --> 10:01.982
AND THEN WHILE
IT HAPPENS,

10:02.050 --> 10:06.086
AND THEN AGAIN
AFTER IT HAPPENS.

10:06.154 --> 10:07.105
W- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:07.255 --> 10:08.655
I'M GOING TO GO
BACK TO THAT VIDEO STORE

10:08.724 --> 10:10.424
AND GET SOMETHING
YOU DON'T HATE.

10:10.491 --> 10:11.142
NO, DAD, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.593
I'M ENJOYING IT,
I MEAN IT-

10:12.661 --> 10:13.294
NO, YOU JUST TELL ME

10:13.361 --> 10:15.646
WHAT MY LITTLE GIRL
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

10:15.714 --> 10:17.431
<i>IN HER SHOES?</i>

10:17.499 --> 10:18.799
I'LL FIND SOMETHING.

10:21.169 --> 10:23.054
GINGER ALE, GINGER ALE,
GINGER ALE...

10:23.121 --> 10:24.655
WHERE'S THE GINGER ALE?

10:24.723 --> 10:27.158
OH, MAN, WE MIGHT HAVE
TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

10:27.225 --> 10:28.159
OH, JUST STOP, ALL RIGHT.

10:28.226 --> 10:29.426
MAN, LOOK AT THIS, HERE.

10:29.494 --> 10:31.612
LEMON-LIME,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.230
NO, I TRIED THAT
WITH HIM ONE TIME.

10:33.298 --> 10:36.166
IT WAS A BAD WEEK.

10:36.234 --> 10:39.853
UGH, FREAKING NAGEL,
JEEZ.

10:39.921 --> 10:40.988
HEY, REMEMBER
WHEN HE GOT

10:41.056 --> 10:42.590
THAT, UH, BRAND NEW
CHRYSLER CORDOBA,

10:42.658 --> 10:44.725
AND WE EGGED
THE CRAP OUT OF IT?

10:44.793 --> 10:48.128
YEAH, THAT WAS
A GOOD NIGHT.

10:48.196 --> 10:50.848
YEAH.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.199
FUNNY, HE ACTUALLY
JUST SOLD THAT THING.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.702
HE BOUGHT A PRIUS
WITH THE BONUS HE GOT

10:54.770 --> 10:57.037
FOR REPORTS I WROTE.

10:57.105 --> 10:59.123
PRIUS, HUH?

10:59.191 --> 11:01.225
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
ON THE WAY HOME,

11:01.293 --> 11:04.812
WE GO A LITTLE
YOLK-O ONO ON HIM?

11:04.879 --> 11:05.529
COME ON!

11:05.597 --> 11:06.647
NO, NO!

11:06.714 --> 11:07.531
DEFINITELY, YES!
NO, NO, NO.

11:07.599 --> 11:08.682
HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.451
HE CALLED ME HORIZONTAL,
AND JEFF SUSSMAN?

11:11.519 --> 11:13.003
HE'S GOT YOU SWEATING
OVER GINGER ALE?

11:13.071 --> 11:15.038
LET'S TAKE HIM DOWN
A NOTCH!

11:15.106 --> 11:16.157
WE'RE NOT KIDS
ANYMORE, DOUG.

11:16.224 --> 11:17.825
I- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

11:17.892 --> 11:19.726
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE NOT DEAD EITHER, OK?

11:19.794 --> 11:21.829
JUST ONE NIGHT,
AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK

11:21.896 --> 11:24.332
TO OUR BORING,
STUPID LIVES.

11:35.961 --> 11:39.063
THE EXPIRED ONES
ARE EXTRA SMELLY.

11:45.253 --> 11:46.420
I'LL TAKE CARE OF DANTE,

11:46.488 --> 11:48.855
YOU JUST TRY
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

11:48.923 --> 11:51.692
I
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS FOR ME.

11:51.759 --> 11:54.411
YOU'RE A FEDERAL WITNESS.
IT'S MY JOB.

11:54.479 --> 11:56.129
IS IT JUST YOUR JOB?

11:56.197 --> 11:59.834
'CAUSE I KEEP THINKING
IT'S SOMETHING... MORE.

12:04.389 --> 12:08.025
I'LL BE BACK
IN 20 MINUTES.

12:15.784 --> 12:17.534
MMM.
MMM.

12:17.602 --> 12:19.920
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONTINUE
THIS OVER AT YOUR PLACE?

12:19.987 --> 12:22.623
WORKS FOR ME.

12:22.691 --> 12:26.811
B
- BEFORE WE GO, THOUGH, CAN I JUST CLEAR UP ONE LITTLE THING?

12:26.878 --> 12:28.212
WHAT IS IT?

12:28.279 --> 12:31.182
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUST SOMETHING

12:31.250 --> 12:32.650
MY IDIOT FRIEND SAID.

12:32.717 --> 12:34.318
JUST DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.252
OK, ONE SECOND.

12:35.404 --> 12:36.670
YEAH, YEAH, SURE, SURE.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.542
OH, YOU WANT
TO FRESHEN YOURS UP?

12:50.918 --> 12:53.104
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

12:53.172 --> 12:54.371
ALL RIGHT,
CATCH YOU LATER.

12:58.059 --> 12:59.209
HEY, YOU'RE
DANNY HEFFERNAN.

12:59.277 --> 13:00.377
YEAH.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.580
JUSTIN RAYVO.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.

13:02.647 --> 13:04.231
OH, YEAH, MAN.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

13:04.299 --> 13:05.749
CAPTAIN
OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM,

13:05.817 --> 13:06.817
PROM KING,

13:06.885 --> 13:07.818
MATHLETE.

13:08.987 --> 13:11.121
I'M JUST SURPRISED
YOU REMEMBERED ME.

13:11.189 --> 13:11.989
OF COURSE I DO.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.408
YOU WERE THE TEAM'S
ONLY MALE CHEERLEADER.

13:14.476 --> 13:17.244
YEAH, TILL I FELL OFF
THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID.

13:19.046 --> 13:20.398
YEAH, THAT WAS CRAZY.

13:20.465 --> 13:22.699
SO, YOU WANNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

13:27.005 --> 13:28.789
YEAH!
WHOO!

13:28.857 --> 13:29.940
CLEMENS BRINGING
THE HEAT.

13:30.008 --> 13:31.375
OH, YEAH!
SHINER!

13:31.443 --> 13:32.542
OH, NICE!
YEAH!

13:32.610 --> 13:33.794
I CAN'T BELIEVE-

13:33.862 --> 13:34.761
THIS IS FUN, RIGHT?

13:34.829 --> 13:35.830
YOU TALKED ME
INTO THIS.

13:35.897 --> 13:37.648
OH, OFF THE TOP!

13:37.716 --> 13:39.767
HERE WE GO.

13:39.835 --> 13:41.469
THIS IS FUN. THIS IS FUN.

13:41.536 --> 13:43.120
IT'S FUN TO DO THIS.

13:43.188 --> 13:45.305
FEELS RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

13:46.741 --> 13:48.575
HEY, SUSSMAN.

13:48.644 --> 13:50.811
YOU CAN'T MAKE
ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS.

13:50.879 --> 13:53.047
THAT'S MY JOB.

13:53.115 --> 13:54.381
YEAH, SUSSMAN,

13:54.449 --> 13:56.733
YOU CAN'T-YOU CAN'T
USE THE PHONE

13:56.801 --> 13:59.486
'CAUSE I USE THE PHONE
FOR LONG-DISTANCE CALLS.

13:59.554 --> 14:02.723
GET ME MY GINGER ALE,
SUSSMAN!

14:02.790 --> 14:03.924
GET ME MY GINGER ALE!

14:03.992 --> 14:05.993
GET SOME GINGER ALE,
GET SOME GINGER ALE,

14:06.060 --> 14:07.795
GET SOME GINGER ALE!

14:10.382 --> 14:13.567
ALL RIGHT, UH... HEY.

14:14.569 --> 14:17.504
LOOKS LIKE, UH,
WE'RE OUT OF EGGS.

14:17.572 --> 14:19.874
WE BETTER RELOAD THEN.

14:19.941 --> 14:22.510
WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST
HEAD BACK TO THE REUNION.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.678
BACK TO THE STORE.
YOU DRIVE.

14:24.746 --> 14:26.413
I'LL CLUB
SOME MAIL BOXES.

14:26.481 --> 14:27.414
COME ON!

14:32.987 --> 14:34.121
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD
MOVIE, DAD.

14:34.189 --> 14:35.122
YOU PICKED A WINNER.

14:35.190 --> 14:36.123
THANK YOU, DARLING.

14:36.191 --> 14:37.525
THIS POPCORN IS DELICIOUS.

14:37.592 --> 14:39.527
YOU'RE A MAGICIAN
WITH THAT MICROWAVE.

14:40.812 --> 14:41.479
WATCH, DADDY.

14:41.546 --> 14:43.064
I'M GOING TO SWIM
ALL THE WAY ACROSS.

14:43.131 --> 14:44.765
YOU CAN
DO IT, SWEETIE!

14:44.833 --> 14:46.533
I'M DOING IT!
I'M REALLY DOING IT!

14:46.601 --> 14:50.437
THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN
YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL.

14:50.505 --> 14:51.705
RIGHT, DAD.

14:51.773 --> 14:53.090
I MEAN IT'S LIKE...

14:53.158 --> 14:55.759
WHEN I WOULD TAKE YOU
TO THE POOL.

14:55.827 --> 14:58.478
NOT QUITE.

14:58.546 --> 15:00.080
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:00.148 --> 15:01.481
WE WOULD GO SWIMMING
EVERY SATURDAY

15:01.550 --> 15:03.383
AND WE'D HAVE
A WONDERFUL TIME.

15:03.451 --> 15:05.336
<i>UH, NO, WE WOULDN'T
GO SWIMMING.</i>

15:05.404 --> 15:08.605
UH, I HAD TO WAIT IN THE CAR
WHILE YOU DID WATER AEROBICS.

15:08.673 --> 15:09.739
THAT'S HOW
I KEPT IN SHAPE.

15:09.807 --> 15:12.442
BESIDES, SOMEONE
HAD TO FEED THE METER.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.395
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

15:14.463 --> 15:18.566
BUT WOULD IT HAVE KILLED YOU JUST
TO CRACK THE WINDOW A LITTLE BIT?

15:18.633 --> 15:21.301
NOTHING WAS EVER GOOD ENOUGH
FOR PRINCESS CARRIE.

15:21.369 --> 15:23.570
<i>PRINCESS, OK.</i>

15:23.638 --> 15:25.055
DAD, I DON'T KNOW
MANY PRINCESSES

15:25.123 --> 15:26.923
WHO HAD TO PACK UP IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

15:26.992 --> 15:28.758
AND MOVE EVERY MONTH.

15:28.826 --> 15:30.660
I HAD BAD LUCK
WITH LANDLORDS.

15:30.728 --> 15:32.162
NO, NOT BAD LUCK.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.698
YOU JUST DIDN'T PAY THE
RENT, SO THEY KICKED US OUT.

15:34.765 --> 15:36.333
WELL, I WOULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO PAY THE RENT

15:36.401 --> 15:38.302
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
AN UNGRATEFUL CHILD

15:38.370 --> 15:39.970
MESSING UP
ALL MY INVENTIONS.

15:40.038 --> 15:42.840
OK, ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE TURNIP PEELER?

15:42.907 --> 15:45.009
BECAUSE THAT WASN'T
AN INVENTION,

15:45.077 --> 15:47.178
IT WAS A POTATO PEELER
WITH A FANCY HANDLE.

15:47.245 --> 15:48.812
I MEAN, I WAS 8,
AND I KNEW THAT.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.983
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

15:53.051 --> 15:54.200
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

15:54.268 --> 15:55.869
WHEN I SAW YOU AT THE VIDEO
STORE TONIGHT, I WAS JUST GOING

15:55.937 --> 15:57.604
TO PRETEND LIKE I DIDN'T
SEE YOU AND KEEP WALKING.

15:57.672 --> 15:59.189
THEN I THOUGHT, "NO HE'S
YOUR DAD, IT'D BE NICE

15:59.257 --> 16:01.158
TO SIT AND WATCH
A VIDEO WITH HIM."

16:01.226 --> 16:03.276
NEXT TIME, I'M JUST
GOING TO KEEP WALKING.

16:05.413 --> 16:08.115
THAT ATTITUDE IS WHY
I NEVER TOOK YOU SWIMMING!

16:13.638 --> 16:17.791
WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
SLEEPING IN THE CAR TONIGHT.

16:17.859 --> 16:20.110
SO, SHE KNOWS
YOU'RE A GUY?

16:20.178 --> 16:22.763
LOOK, EVERY RELATIONSHIP
HAS ITS LITTLE SECRETS.

16:22.831 --> 16:25.198
I JUST WANT TO SEE
WHERE THIS ONE GOES.

16:25.266 --> 16:27.467
YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE. NOWHERE.

16:27.535 --> 16:29.253
OH, OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS

16:29.321 --> 16:31.389
BECAUSE I HOOKED UP
WITH SOMEONE, AND YOU DIDN'T.

16:31.456 --> 16:34.291
<i>OH, I GUESS THE CAPTAIN OF THE
FOOTBALL TEAM ISN'T SOMEBODY.</i>

16:36.428 --> 16:38.595
CAPTAIN-
JUSTIN RAYVO?!

16:38.663 --> 16:39.796
YEP.

16:39.864 --> 16:40.464
HE'S OUT LIKE TROUT,

16:40.532 --> 16:43.550
AND HE WANTS A PIECE
OF THIS.

16:43.618 --> 16:46.537
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING WITH HIM?

16:46.604 --> 16:47.671
I DON'T KNOW.

16:47.738 --> 16:49.706
THROW BACK A COUPLE
BEERS, WATCH SOME TUBE,

16:49.774 --> 16:51.825
WHO KNOWS?

16:51.893 --> 16:53.844
YOU'RE JUST DOING THIS
TO MESS ME UP.

16:53.912 --> 16:55.045
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

16:55.113 --> 16:56.430
I'M PATHETIC?

16:56.498 --> 16:57.431
AT LEAST SOMEONE HERE

16:57.499 --> 16:59.833
<i>THINKS I'M
AN ATTRACTIVE MAN.</i>

16:59.900 --> 17:00.934
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:01.002 --> 17:02.636
AT LEAST AT THE END
OF MY RAINBOW

17:02.704 --> 17:04.505
THERE'S A VAGINA.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.089
YEAH? AND WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO

17:07.157 --> 17:08.442
WHEN SHE ROUNDS
THIRD BASE AND FINDS OUT

17:08.510 --> 17:11.078
THERE'S A BAT ON
THE FIELD?

17:11.145 --> 17:13.246
I'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE-

17:13.314 --> 17:14.948
BOTTOM LINE IS
I WANT THE APARTMENT.

17:15.016 --> 17:16.950
YEAH, WELL, SO DO I.

17:21.489 --> 17:23.240
I'M JUSTIN,
BY THE WAY.

17:23.308 --> 17:27.060
I THINK WE MET
AT OUTFEST '97.

17:27.127 --> 17:28.896
MM-HMM.

17:36.804 --> 17:38.739
OH, NO.

17:38.806 --> 17:40.106
NO!

17:41.860 --> 17:43.393
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

17:43.461 --> 17:46.563
YO! YOU CAN'T BE
CLOSED RIGHT NOW!

17:46.631 --> 17:48.465
SUSSMAN, MAN, COME ON.

17:48.532 --> 17:50.300
WHAT IS IT, MAN?

17:50.368 --> 17:52.285
YOU'RE JUST GETTING
A LITTLE CRAZY HERE.

17:52.354 --> 17:54.321
COME ON, WE ALREADY
TRASHED NAGEL'S CAR.

17:54.389 --> 17:56.623
AND I'M PRETTY SURE ONE
OF HIS WINDOWS WAS OPEN.

17:56.691 --> 17:59.276
IT WAS OPEN.
I PEED IN IT.

17:59.344 --> 18:00.294
COME ON,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:00.361 --> 18:01.895
LET ME-LET ME
TAKE YOU HOME, HUH?

18:03.064 --> 18:04.164
YOU'RE RIGHT, HEF.

18:04.232 --> 18:06.199
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:06.267 --> 18:07.601
ALL RIGHT.

18:21.732 --> 18:24.017
WHAT'RE YOU DOING? WE GOTTA
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

18:24.085 --> 18:26.586
RELAX, AVERAGE RESPONSE
TIME IS 8 MINUTES.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.760
8 MINUTES?

18:33.795 --> 18:35.011
8 MINUTES FROM WHEN?

18:35.079 --> 18:36.746
FROM WHEN YOU THREW THE
GARBAGE CAN THROUGH THE WINDOW?

18:36.814 --> 18:40.083
OR STARTING NOW?
HOW LONG'S IT BEEN?

18:40.151 --> 18:42.819
OH, I GOTTA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

18:42.887 --> 18:45.371
HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED GLOVES. FOR WHAT?

18:45.439 --> 18:46.941
FOR WHEN WE BREAK
INTO HIS PLACE.

18:47.008 --> 18:48.909
HE'S GOT A RARE COIN
COLLECTION.

18:48.944 --> 18:49.793
WE'RE GOING
TO STEAL IT,

18:49.861 --> 18:50.794
WE'RE GOING
TO SELL IT,

18:50.862 --> 18:52.029
WE'RE GOING
TO MOVE TO MEXICO.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.047
TRY TO DRINK THE GINGER
ALE WITH THIS ON YOUR MOUTH.

19:14.852 --> 19:16.853
HEY, UH, BUDDY,
I THINK I'M GONNA SCOOT,

19:16.921 --> 19:18.138
BUT YOU HAVE
A GOOD ROBBERY,

19:18.206 --> 19:20.140
AND HEY, I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE 25th, SUSSIE!

19:20.208 --> 19:21.641
GOOD CATCHING UP
WITH YOU, HEF!

19:27.164 --> 19:28.965
<i>I WANT TO RENT IN HER SHOES.</i>

19:29.033 --> 19:31.168
I'M AFRAID WE'RE CLOSED,
SIR.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.335
BUT IT'S FOR MY DAUGHTER.

19:32.403 --> 19:33.553
I'M SORRY,

19:33.621 --> 19:35.155
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO COME BACK TOMORROW.

19:35.222 --> 19:39.960
LOOK, I WAS NEVER
THERE FOR MY DAUGHTER.

19:40.028 --> 19:43.197
NEVER GAVE HER
THE CHILDHOOD SHE DESERVED.

19:43.264 --> 19:45.866
I ONLY THOUGHT OF MYSELF.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.435
YOU SOUND A LOT LIKE
MY DAD.

19:48.502 --> 19:50.670
THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:50.738 --> 19:52.405
WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL
IF YOU SAT DOWN WITH HIM

19:52.473 --> 19:56.043
<i>AND WATCHED IN HER SHOES?</i>

19:56.110 --> 19:57.711
OF COURSE IT WOULD.

20:00.381 --> 20:01.598
IT'S OVER THERE!

20:01.666 --> 20:03.500
NOW, HURRY UP!

20:03.568 --> 20:05.151
OH, GOD. THE ALARM.

20:05.219 --> 20:07.721
AND ONLY THE MORNING CREW
HAS THE CODE!

20:07.789 --> 20:10.374
I AM SO FIRED.

20:10.441 --> 20:13.060
BE SURE AND LET ME
KNOW WHERE YOU WIND UP.

20:34.049 --> 20:36.166
SEE YOU IN MEXICO! WHOO!

20:43.424 --> 20:46.060
THIS I DIDN'T SEE COMING.

20:47.305 --> 20:53.273
