00:09.840 --> 00:11.840
[ominous music playing]

00:14.440 --> 00:15.800
[car enging revving]

00:16.760 --> 00:18.040
[car alarm blaring]

00:18.120 --> 00:19.600
[Sophie gasping]

00:21.040 --> 00:22.000
[breathing heavily]

00:22.080 --> 00:23.720
[man laughing]

00:23.800 --> 00:24.640
[Sophie] Hello?

00:24.720 --> 00:26.160
[girl crying]

00:26.240 --> 00:27.680
[sinister music playing]

00:37.160 --> 00:38.120
[whispering] Holly?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.600
[Sophie's breath shuddering]

00:45.400 --> 00:46.440
[Holly screaming]

00:46.520 --> 00:47.720
[Sophie gasping]

00:47.800 --> 00:49.200
[car alarm blaring]

00:49.280 --> 00:52.320
[breathing heavily]

00:57.000 --> 00:58.240
[sighing]

01:03.280 --> 01:04.880
[exhaling slowly]

01:07.400 --> 01:09.560
[Kate] I can't stop
thinking about the case.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.520
Angela scored some points.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.040
You'll do the same tomorrow.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.240
It's Olivia who's haunting me.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.920
I don't want her to feel like a pawn.
I'd never forgive myself.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.480
Rubbish. She's lucky to have you.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.320
Unless I fail her.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.720
That is impossible.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.320
Richard, forgive me, but--

01:34.400 --> 01:38.040
Why don't we just enjoy the rare fact

01:38.600 --> 01:41.240
of us getting to spend
the whole night together.

01:42.040 --> 01:42.960
[kisses]

01:48.480 --> 01:49.960
Uh, this is terrible of me.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.240
-I'm so sorry, I just need to be alone.
-[Richard scoffing]

01:58.880 --> 01:59.800
You want me to go?

02:01.040 --> 02:02.160
What, at this hour?

02:04.480 --> 02:05.320
Um…

02:08.200 --> 02:09.120
Okay.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.080
It's the case. I'm distracted.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.800
[Richard] Yep. Got it.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.200
[clothes rustling]

02:24.560 --> 02:25.600
[inhales deeply]

02:25.680 --> 02:28.560
You seem
to be taking it rather personally.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.160
Well, always.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.480
[Richard] No. Not like this.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.800
I mean… [sighing]

02:33.640 --> 02:35.080
…what if you're wrong?

02:35.800 --> 02:39.480
What if James Whitehouse
is just your garden-variety philanderer?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.120
He's a rapist.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.520
Although a philanderer too,
no doubt. He's a married man.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.840
I'm a married man.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.880
Yes, but you're unhappy.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.720
I'm still married.

02:48.800 --> 02:49.920
Yes, but you're kind.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.360
You don't behave
like an entitled arsehole.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.240
And Olivia worked for him.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.520
There was a power imbalance
baked into their relationship.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.840
I was your pupil master once upon a time.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.720
But I went after you, remember?

03:00.800 --> 03:03.680
Yeah, but you keep talking
about the balance of power.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.240
[Richard sighing]

03:06.920 --> 03:09.520
It's making me wonder if there's something
that you're not saying.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.160
But our power imbalance is in the past.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.600
That's what I always thought.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.760
[Kate sighing]

03:23.320 --> 03:25.120
-Talk tomorrow?
-[Richard] Yeah.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.440
If I can.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.480
[sighing]

03:37.480 --> 03:39.480
[clock ticking]

03:55.040 --> 03:55.880
[lighter clicks]

04:01.840 --> 04:03.480
[tense music playing]

04:03.560 --> 04:05.560
[indistinct talk echoing]

04:08.760 --> 04:09.720
[girl] Hey, Sophie.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.840
-[girl 2] Morning, Sophie. How are you?
-Morning.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.920
[Sophie] Knock, knock.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.600
Sorry I'm late. Did you do the notes?

04:19.680 --> 04:22.240
Uh, yeah. It's on the desk,
on top of the blue folder.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.600
[Sophie] Christ. Now I know where to go
if I ever need a non-yellow highlighter.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.360
I know I said I'd have the Woolf notes,

04:28.440 --> 04:30.440
but I'm only halfway
through the book. [chuckles]

04:31.040 --> 04:32.840
Halfway "to the lighthouse" as it were.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.960
[tense music swelling]

04:45.280 --> 04:46.960
Take the notes and go.
I did next week's too.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.600
[Sophie] Did something happen?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.320
Are you leaving, Holly?

04:51.400 --> 04:53.440
There's two weeks left
until the end of term.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.080
Just go away.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.040
[breath shuddering]

05:05.880 --> 05:07.920
I said, fuck off!

05:10.200 --> 05:11.840
[tense music swelling]

05:15.240 --> 05:16.920
[kettle whistling]

05:17.920 --> 05:19.880
[water bubbling]

05:23.080 --> 05:25.200
-Krystyna.
-Sorry. I didn't realise you--

05:25.280 --> 05:27.640
I'm so sorry
for the way I spoke to you earlier.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.480
Inexcusable.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.600
You have a lot going on.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.560
That doesn't matter.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.520
You've been sucked
into the whole hideous mess.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.920
The paparazzi on our doorstep,
having to lie on our behalf.

05:44.160 --> 05:48.160
I was brought up to control my emotions.
I've suddenly lost all my skills.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.240
[dramatic music playing]

05:57.400 --> 06:00.720
You think he's a good man, don't you?

06:02.360 --> 06:06.240
A bit assertive, but not brutish?

06:08.640 --> 06:10.160
Not the kind of man who'd…

06:12.280 --> 06:13.160
[crying]

06:13.240 --> 06:15.880
'Cause otherwise, you wouldn't stay
working here, would you?

06:16.520 --> 06:18.080
He's not a brute.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.240
[exhales sharply]

06:21.840 --> 06:23.000
He's a good man.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.320
He's a man.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.600
[sighing heavily]

06:33.520 --> 06:36.000
-[Chris] What did you say to him?
-Why are you FaceTiming me?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.000
Because I need to see your lying face.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.760
What makes you think
I said anything to him?

06:39.840 --> 06:41.360
[Christ] He was finally due to acknowledge

06:41.440 --> 06:43.720
the seriousness of the allegations
against you in this trial

06:43.800 --> 06:47.000
and how the House of Commons
needs to be a safe space, blah blah,

06:47.080 --> 06:50.160
and now, all of a sudden,
he's choosing to remain silent.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.520
So, James, I repeat,

06:51.600 --> 06:53.640
what the fuck did you say to him?

06:53.720 --> 06:55.640
That he'll weather
this no-confidence storm

06:55.720 --> 06:57.360
and he has my full support.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.200
[Chris chuckles] Your full support

06:59.280 --> 07:01.960
is a wet turd on the floor
of the Palace of Westminster.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.200
You're an accused rapist, twice over.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.400
I am innocent.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.640
If you're calling to tell me
he's continuing to stand by me,

07:07.720 --> 07:09.040
I thank you for the message.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.080
[Chris] Let's just hope
his suicidal support of you

07:11.160 --> 07:13.840
doesn't bring down his government,
you stupid cunt.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.000
Say hello to Sophie.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.600
Oh, apologies for my vulgarity,
Sophie. I was raised by wolves.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.480
Oh God, look at you.
You're just as lovely without make-up.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.640
Fuck you very much, Chris.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.280
[Chris] Anytime. I'll see you shortly.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.360
You won't be seeing me.
I'm not coming to court.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.600
[Chris] No.
No, you can't not stand by him.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.480
Standing by him doesn't mean
I have to sit there, lapping it all up.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.400
-[cell phone chimes]
-God, he's vile.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.160
I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't disappointed.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.080
Well, you'll have Chris to support you.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.880
Your support
is far more meaningful, believe me.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.800
Why not just be there? The worst is over.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.560
B, how do you know?

07:48.080 --> 07:49.720
And A, because I'm taking the children

07:49.800 --> 07:51.760
to the country
for the day to see your parents.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.960
But it's a school day.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.040
[Sophie] It's a nightmare,
and they need a break.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.520
Finn's back to wetting the bed,

07:58.600 --> 08:00.880
and Emily's started biting
her cuticles again.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.600
And to tell you the truth,
I won't mind missing today's evidence

08:03.680 --> 08:06.040
from the friend
reinforcing Olivia's words,

08:06.120 --> 08:10.480
as told to her, about the ways
in which you kissed, sucked,

08:10.560 --> 08:12.360
tweaked and poked her.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.280
Because you know,
James, the distinct parallels

08:14.360 --> 08:18.120
between the way you do those things to me
were less than fun to hear.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.080
[clattering]

08:19.760 --> 08:21.400
[James sighing]
I will make this up to you.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.600
Yes, you will.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.080
[clattering]

08:27.560 --> 08:29.680
I had a dream last night about Holly.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
A nightmare.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.600
She was accusing you.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.480
Do I have to defend myself
against your nightmares as well now?

08:38.520 --> 08:39.360
Maybe.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.360
[dramatic music playing]

08:42.280 --> 08:43.440
When will you be back?

08:44.160 --> 08:47.360
We're just going for the day.
A bit of country air will do us good.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.520
I'm giving evidence tomorrow.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.040
Yes. And I'll be there for you.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.560
[air hissing]

09:02.400 --> 09:03.240
Thanks.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.840
Oh, I thought this place
was my little secret.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.240
-What are you playing at?
-Sorry?

09:08.320 --> 09:11.120
The Oxford police
making inquiries about my client.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.280
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-Who's behind it then?

09:14.760 --> 09:15.800
I haven't a clue.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.080
Whatever it is, it wouldn't
be admissible at this stage anyway.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.120
Obviously.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.760
What did they say, the Oxford police?

09:22.840 --> 09:27.360
It was some report
about an assault at uni in the '90s.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.080
-Involving Whitehouse?
-Hmm.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.320
The allegation was made by a third-party.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.800
There's no complainant.
And when they tried to track her down,

09:36.880 --> 09:40.000
her mother said she'd moved
to Australia and they'd lost touch.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.120
Believe me, Angela, the last thing I want

09:42.200 --> 09:44.160
is for anything to interfere
with this trial.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.000
Certainly not before
I've given your client a good kicking.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.160
Do you ever think about
the population of the woodwork?

09:51.240 --> 09:53.880
So many fucking crazy people
stuffed in there,

09:53.960 --> 09:55.960
waiting for their moment to emerge.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.400
[Brian] So this jury analysis
you've been conducting

10:00.480 --> 10:02.440
is based on what, exactly?

10:02.520 --> 10:03.360
Observation.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.240
Ms Long Curly Hair in the front row

10:05.320 --> 10:07.600
stares at him for hours
like a starstruck teenager.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.840
Sounds like her mind's
going down a dirty little path.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.320
Well, at the very least
she'd like to acquit him.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.840
But Grey Shirt Guy
is definitely on our side.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.760
Grey shirt guys always vote to convict.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.840
Maggie, I need a word.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.000
[door closing]

10:27.200 --> 10:28.920
You didn't discuss making inquiries

10:29.000 --> 10:32.480
into James Whitehouse's Oxford years
with any of the case officers, did you?

10:32.560 --> 10:33.400
Of course not.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.480
Because I expressly said
it wasn't relevant.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.440
I know.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.200
You're absolutely sure you didn't?

10:38.280 --> 10:40.840
I follow your instructions, Kate, always.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.440
[suspenseful music playing]

10:43.200 --> 10:44.160
Well, I'm sorry.

10:45.000 --> 10:45.920
I'm tired.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.000
[sighing] Look,
I forgot to take care of something.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.560
-Is there anything you'd like me to do?
-No. I'll be back.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.160
[car horn honking]

11:04.920 --> 11:06.640
[driver] I'm rooting for you, sir.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.920
I appreciate it.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.560
-[driver] Can I ask you a question though?
-Of course.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.800
[driver] What are you lot
gonna do about bloody Uber?

11:15.880 --> 11:17.400
They're massacring us.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.680
[woman] The office said
it was an emergency.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.720
[Kate] Sorry.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.120
[woman] Well, don't be.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.760
Aren't you due in court today?

11:31.320 --> 11:33.000
[Kate] Yeah, in minutes.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.160
[children clamouring]

11:34.240 --> 11:36.200
[woman] Well, talk to me.

11:37.000 --> 11:37.880
You all right?

11:39.840 --> 11:40.800
[breath shuddering]

11:40.880 --> 11:41.880
I'm not sure.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.360
Your case is getting a lot of attention.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.800
[sighing heavily]

11:47.880 --> 11:49.800
No surprise if you feel a bit wobbly.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.600
[children giggling]

11:52.200 --> 11:53.160
It's not that.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.200
Then what? What's happened?

11:57.520 --> 11:59.520
[breathing heavily]

12:02.440 --> 12:03.320
It's nothing.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.000
I just needed to hear a familiar voice.

12:07.080 --> 12:07.920
[woman] Kate.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.640
Should you talk to the judge or something?

12:13.480 --> 12:14.720
[Kate] No. I'm fine.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.640
I'm fine.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.800
[phone line beeping]

12:18.560 --> 12:19.600
[booth door closing]

12:22.840 --> 12:24.680
[tense music playing]

12:25.360 --> 12:28.720
[driver] It's a bit busy here today, sir.
Shall I drop you off round the back?

12:28.800 --> 12:30.360
That won't be necessary.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.720
[camera shutters clicking]

12:33.520 --> 12:35.520
[journalists clamouring]

12:40.960 --> 12:43.320
-Mr Whitehouse, where's Sophie?
-Where's Sophie?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.800
[journalist] Mr Whitehouse,
where's Sophie?

12:57.720 --> 12:58.960
-[Finn] Granny! Grandpa!
-Granny!

12:59.040 --> 13:01.200
-Oh, sweet pea!
-Good to see you.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.720
[woman] Missed you. Hello, my little man.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.160
-[Emily] I missed you.
-How are you?

13:05.240 --> 13:06.080
Hello. Hi.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.560
What is that?

13:07.640 --> 13:08.720
Ribena.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.080
-You are such a mucky pup.
-[Sophie] Bit of a spill.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.200
-Sophie. Come in.
-I know what you like to do.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.960
-Play a bit of croquet.
-[Finn] Yes!

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
[birds warbling]

13:19.000 --> 13:20.800
-[Emily] Whoo!
-[man speaking indistinctly]

13:20.880 --> 13:23.240
[woman] Are you sure
I shouldn't soak his shirt?

13:23.720 --> 13:24.960
I haven't got another.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.360
[woman] It'll be ruined
if it sits for too long.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.120
I do hate waste.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.560
Well, as we've learned,

13:34.360 --> 13:36.080
shit happens, Tuppence.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.320
How are you doing, dear?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.080
We're getting on.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.720
[Tuppence] Almost over.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.960
The trial is, yes.

13:46.240 --> 13:50.640
I get so angry in the middle of the night
when I think of that girl's vicious lies.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.760
She's trying to exploit his good nature.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.080
He was always so happy and handsome

13:58.160 --> 14:00.920
and successful
at everything that he tried.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.920
So bright.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.520
He knew it, mind you.

14:07.600 --> 14:11.160
Perhaps it's a male thing,
that complete self-belief.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.560
My girls don't have it.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.360
Neither do I.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.120
Even as a very little boy,
he was like that.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.840
Like what?

14:21.920 --> 14:23.800
[Tuppence] Over-confident, I suppose.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.840
Unashamedly lying at Cluedo
and cheating at Monopoly.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.440
Insisting on changing the rules.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.080
You're good for him.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.960
His father and I have always
made that quite clear to him,

14:39.040 --> 14:40.680
how lucky he is to have you.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.160
Why would you do that?

14:42.880 --> 14:44.240
[Tuppence] Do what, Sophie?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.920
[Sophie] Raise your son
to believe that it's okay to cheat?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.320
To cheat at Monopoly?

14:49.040 --> 14:52.480
-It's only a game, dear.
-With which he honed his ability to lie.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.760
Well, perhaps
I should have said "dissemble."

14:54.840 --> 14:55.840
Lie.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.400
[Tuppence] I don't need to remind you,

14:57.480 --> 15:00.920
politics requires a certain agility
in that regard.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.360
It doesn't require him to lie to me.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.240
[dishes clattering]

15:07.200 --> 15:09.680
It may seem insurmountable
to you at the moment,

15:09.760 --> 15:11.800
but you will get through this.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.440
[children clamouring]

15:19.760 --> 15:22.040
Sometimes, I think I'm partly to blame.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.920
I beg your pardon?

15:25.160 --> 15:26.560
I let things slide. I…

15:27.920 --> 15:30.400
didn't question little things
when I should have,

15:30.480 --> 15:34.800
but… little things add up, don't they?

15:34.880 --> 15:37.720
Oh nonsense.
You're a model wife and mother.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.800
I hope you don't mind me saying
what I've always suspected.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.360
The fact that you survived
a broken home as a child

15:45.440 --> 15:49.600
has made you all the more determined
to keep your own family together.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.960
And to that, I say bravo.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.560
What this girl is doing to James
is inexcusable.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.200
Actually, Tuppence,
she's of another generation.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.360
Things were very different
when I was at uni,

16:08.440 --> 16:10.720
the blurriness of consent.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.720
Men were guilty of selfish exuberance.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.240
We were guilty of failure to communicate.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.760
Does that make us complicit?

16:21.160 --> 16:25.480
Because sometimes,
I think it was just easier to acquiesce.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.240
Oh, please don't tell me
that you've ever been assaulted.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.520
-No.
-[Tuppence] Oh thank God for that.

16:32.320 --> 16:36.000
Sophie,
I've never seen you like this before.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.520
Well, James is on trial for rape.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.360
[dramatic music playing]

16:41.080 --> 16:42.120
My son

16:43.200 --> 16:45.000
will be proven innocent.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.400
Then everything can go back
to the way it was.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.920
[Kitty] Conservative Central Office.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.320
[Kate] Can you tell us please,
Miss Ledger,

17:03.400 --> 17:06.600
about your part
in what brought Mr Whitehouse here?

17:06.680 --> 17:09.880
[Kitty] It was Mr Whitehouse's
own actions that brought him here.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.480
When did Miss Lytton first tell you
about the events we are concerned with?

17:13.560 --> 17:14.600
The next day.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.720
-[Kate] How did she seem?
-[Kitty] Very upset indeed.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.080
Normally,
she was quite blasé about things.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.320
Or had been before her relationship
with the minister ended.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.040
Had she told you
about the affair prior to this?

17:26.120 --> 17:27.120
[Kitty] Yes.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.760
She needed a friend
and knew I would be discreet.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.000
And, uh…

17:33.840 --> 17:36.880
what did you think about your friend's
involvement with the minister?

17:38.120 --> 17:39.800
I thought it was a mistake.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.040
[ominous music playing]

17:41.120 --> 17:43.360
[jury murmuring]

17:43.440 --> 17:44.360
Fuck.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.560
Um, Miss Woodcroft?

17:57.560 --> 18:01.320
What did Miss Lytton tell you the next day
about what happened in the lift?

18:01.920 --> 18:04.240
She blamed herself
for the fact that he raped her.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.360
Did she describe the events
in the lift to you?

18:07.440 --> 18:08.920
In horrifying detail.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.680
Who raised the question of rape?

18:11.760 --> 18:12.600
I did.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.600
After she told me
about him ripping her underwear.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.240
After she showed me that bruise.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.720
After she told me what he'd called her.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.160
I said, "You do realise
what he's done, don't you?"

18:24.240 --> 18:25.880
And how did she respond?

18:26.360 --> 18:27.200
[Kitty] With a nod.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.920
And then convulsive crying.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.160
She wouldn't say the word.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.000
So how did it come up?

18:33.080 --> 18:34.320
[Kitty] Well, I said,

18:34.920 --> 18:37.760
"You told him repeatedly
that you didn't want it,

18:37.840 --> 18:39.200
and he ignored you."

18:39.800 --> 18:40.640
"That's rape."

18:42.000 --> 18:43.160
And what happened then?

18:43.760 --> 18:46.120
She couldn't even speak for a long time.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.800
It was a sort of crying I hadn't seen
since childhood, to be honest.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.400
Those hyperventilating breaths.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.760
Did you discuss,
once she'd regained her composure,

18:57.840 --> 19:00.120
what, if any, action she should take?

19:00.200 --> 19:01.720
I suggested she go to the police.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.960
It took her two whole weeks.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.000
She was very reluctant at first.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.920
I… I think she kept hoping she could
will away the fact that it happened.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.400
But that's not going to work, is it?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.920
She needed to admit to herself
what had happened

19:14.000 --> 19:17.360
before she reported that her boss,
James Whitehouse, had raped her.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.280
Miss Regan.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.760
You appear to be
a no-nonsense person, Miss Ledger.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.240
Is that a fair assessment?

19:32.320 --> 19:33.400
I like to think so.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.960
-And you like clarity, is that right?
-Absolutely.

19:36.040 --> 19:39.280
Black is black and white is white,
and never the twain shall meet.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.040
-Grey is overrated.
-[jury chuckling]

19:41.120 --> 19:42.960
Did you approve of your friend,

19:43.040 --> 19:45.520
Miss Lytton's, affair
with James Whitehouse?

19:46.080 --> 19:49.080
-I was worried about Olivia.
-But you believe affairs are wrong?

19:49.680 --> 19:50.600
Yes.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.080
So if your friend comes to you,
upset about her relationship

19:54.160 --> 19:55.760
with a married man,

19:55.840 --> 19:59.160
you'd view any sex
that occurred between them as wrong?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.640
That's not why we're here.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.280
-Even consensual sex? Is that right?
-I don't see how that matters.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.000
Did your views on infidelity

20:05.080 --> 20:08.040
lead you to hound your friend
to go to the police?

20:08.120 --> 20:09.160
"Hound"?

20:09.240 --> 20:12.640
Uh, Miss Regan, I don't think the evidence

20:12.720 --> 20:15.240
is that Miss Ledger
hounded the complainant.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.920
I apologise, My Lord.
Perhaps the point is better put this way.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.400
Is the reason you were so keen
for your friend to go to the police

20:23.480 --> 20:26.760
because you disapproved
of her relationship with her boss?

20:26.840 --> 20:27.680
No.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.960
I told her to go to the police
because he raped her,

20:32.080 --> 20:33.480
in black and white.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.320
[scattered murmuring]

20:43.360 --> 20:45.320
[suspenseful music playing]

20:46.360 --> 20:49.800
[judge] Members of the jury,
we'll adjourn until tomorrow morning.

20:49.880 --> 20:50.960
[clerk] All rise.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.040
[dramatic music playing]

20:59.680 --> 21:01.400
-[Brian] How was it, miss?
-Awful.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.760
It wasn't awful,
but Kitty Ledger was great.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
Unshakeable.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.320
But Kate Woodcroft
was off her fucking game.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.640
That's not true.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.160
It's a bit true.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.720
Her ears are bionic.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.040
But the witness…

21:18.600 --> 21:20.440
[journalists clamouring]

21:21.320 --> 21:22.720
[camera shutters clicking]

21:26.480 --> 21:27.840
[journalist] Mr Whitehouse!

21:31.800 --> 21:34.080
-[knocking on door]
[doorbell ringing]

21:34.160 --> 21:35.400
[journalist] Mr Whitehouse!

-[knocking on door]
-[doorbell ringing]

21:44.720 --> 21:46.800
[clock ticking]

21:49.600 --> 21:50.720
Hello?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.360
[Krystyna] They're not back yet.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.200
Ah, hey.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.200
Uh, should I make you something to eat?

21:58.720 --> 22:01.120
Uh, no, thank you, Krystyna.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.720
I… I'm not your job. [chuckling]

22:02.800 --> 22:04.880
Um, uh, did you eat?

22:07.040 --> 22:08.040
Great idea.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.520
Um, is there more?

22:09.600 --> 22:11.280
[Krystyna] Uh, just Rocky Road.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.320
Oh, Finn's flavour.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.320
[Krystyna] Mm.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.920
[James sighing]

22:23.160 --> 22:24.680
[James] No, no. Stay, stay.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.720
[James sighing]

22:32.120 --> 22:33.760
I don't understand marshmallows.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.680
Oh.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.200
Yeah, agreed.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.480
They're completely disgusting.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.720
And occasionally compelling.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.720
[James clearing throat]

22:47.800 --> 22:51.560
[speaking Russian poorly]

22:53.480 --> 22:57.360
[speaking Russian poorly]

22:57.440 --> 22:59.120
I'm sorry I don't understand.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.400
Uh, I'm just trying
to thank you in Russian.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.360
Was that Russian?

23:03.440 --> 23:06.000
Uh, I'm not sure what that was.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.200
I'm hopeless at languages.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.080
Absolutely no ear.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.520
[James chuckling]

23:13.240 --> 23:14.480
But, um…

23:14.560 --> 23:16.480
Uh, seriously, Krystyna, I…

23:17.400 --> 23:18.560
I wanted to thank you.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.720
For what?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.720
For taking such good care of the children.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.200
They trust you and feel safe with you.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.760
I will miss them
when I go back to Podolsk.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.640
What will you study there?

23:38.120 --> 23:39.680
I want to be a civil engineer.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.360
I'm really interested in infrastructure.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.440
[James] Hmm.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.920
I didn't know that about you.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.320
You'll be great.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.360
[James breathing deeply]

23:59.360 --> 24:00.400
[door closing]

staying in the Customs Union,

no control over its trade policy,

the EU could come to trade agreements,

I didn't want to wake you.

As always.

We've always been so lucky, you and I.

I'm not sure I'd call it luck.

[Sophie] What would you call it?

26:49.240 --> 26:51.480
Smart decisions and bloody hard work.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.840
No, James,
mostly we were born and raised lucky.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.520
Well, you just spent the afternoon
with my parents. You call that luck?

26:59.600 --> 27:00.480
[James chuckling]

Now it seems

27:06.200 --> 27:07.120
Yes, it is.

We are officially formerly lucky.

What?

When we spent two weeks in Corsica,
and we made love every single night,

27:33.120 --> 27:37.200
that was in the middle
of your affair with her, correct?

Not the middle, the end.

If you're going to be nasty,
I'm going to bed.

Good night.

I'm not saying it was you. I believe you.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.120
May I ask why

28:03.200 --> 28:06.440
you are more concerned
with your first-year tutorial partner

28:06.520 --> 28:09.440
than this trial, with your husband's life?

28:09.520 --> 28:11.720
-Of course I'm concerned.
-You choose to take the day off!

28:11.800 --> 28:13.920
-For the children!
-[James] Not a great look!

Believe me,
your absence was not lost on anyone.

-I needed a break!
-I'd like a break!

28:21.520 --> 28:23.360
When did you become so crass?

28:23.440 --> 28:25.320
[scoffing] Sorry. Were you making love?

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
We had sex, how about that?

28:27.520 --> 28:29.200
Anything. Sure.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.280

is you should have been in court today…

28:42.000 --> 28:44.440
-[Sophie scoffing]
-…for everyone's sake.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.960
Whatever happened would have been
at the end of our first year.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.760
-What?
-End of the first week in June.

28:53.840 --> 28:57.320
-That's when Holly left.
-I don't give a fuck about Holly!

28:57.400 --> 28:58.600
I know you don't give a fuck,

28:58.680 --> 29:00.400

in my thoughts,

29:00.480 --> 29:03.240
if you don't help me to get there,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.640
But I fear it won't be good.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.400
All of those end of year parties…

29:11.480 --> 29:12.360
[James] Exactly.

Impossible to tell one from the other
at this vantage point, surely.

what happened last week.
