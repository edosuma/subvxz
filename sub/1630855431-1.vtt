00:38.997 --> 00:41.041
Hey, you gotta slow down!

00:41.166 --> 00:42.667
There's a big pothole up there.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.461
-[baby crying]
-I know. Give me
just a few more minutes,

00:44.544 --> 00:46.171
and we'll be
at Grandpa's house.

[music fades]

02:12.257 --> 02:14.134
How am I doing this?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.762
Who am I?

[opening music playing]

02:27.105 --> 02:29.107
[alarm clock ringing]

02:29.190 --> 02:31.693
[whining] Clark. Alarm.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.319
Ha!

02:34.195 --> 02:36.072
It's today.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.991
-[alarm stops ringing]
-Uh...

02:38.116 --> 02:39.909
[alarm beeping]

02:41.244 --> 02:43.121
It's today.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.958
-[alarm continues beeping]
-[grunting]

02:47.042 --> 02:48.293
[Clark] Hello, sir.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.753
Hi, Mr. White.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.880
Uh, okay. Shake gently.
Do not crush his hand.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.089
[Jimmy] Hey, Clark?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.507
-I gotta pee.
-[Clark grunts]

02:54.632 --> 02:57.093
[sighs] Today, just be normal.
Today, just...

02:57.177 --> 02:58.762
Be extraordinary!

02:58.845 --> 03:01.306
Mr. White. Thank you
for calling me in today,

03:01.389 --> 03:04.059
because I've got
one heck of a story for you.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.935
Pew-pew! [chuckles]

03:06.019 --> 03:07.228
No, don't do that to your boss.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.646
-I'm Clark Kent...
-[yawns]

03:08.772 --> 03:09.981
...and this is a dream
come true. [whimpers]

03:10.106 --> 03:11.900
Shoes.

03:11.983 --> 03:16.196
This is it.
This is the story that'll
make you a real reporter.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.906
[inhales, exhales]

03:17.989 --> 03:18.823
You can do this.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.658
[Clark] I can do this.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.536
I'm gonna hide my powers
and be a normal man
having a normal day.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.829
-Starting now.
-[cat meowing]

03:27.832 --> 03:29.292

03:36.549 --> 03:38.009
[meows happily]

03:38.093 --> 03:39.803
Okay, I had to save the cat.
I had to save the cat.

03:39.886 --> 03:44.307
I'm a normal man
having a normal day,
starting now.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.353
Oh! [chuckles nervously]

03:48.436 --> 03:52.232
Hi, there. After... you.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.025
[chuckles] Thanks.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.442
See you in there, big guy.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.283
[clears throat] Hey.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.703
Uh, uh... Hello.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.329
Hey.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.665
-Uh, my name is...
-Clark!

04:08.748 --> 04:11.209
[gasps] Oh,
those repairs you did

04:11.292 --> 04:13.503
on the back door
are wonderful.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.296
[shopkeeper chuckles]

04:15.380 --> 04:17.548
Ooh, and I have
the three dozen donuts

04:17.673 --> 04:19.843
you wanted to eat
all ready to go.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.138
[chuckles] Such
a good appetite, this one.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.390
No, see, it's...
It's not all for me.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.476
But he gets
the sprinkles all over.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.896
[chuckles] That's why
we made him the bib.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.399
Uh... Well, it's...
Today's my first day
of work and I'm...

04:34.482 --> 04:36.151
Honey, Clark is here.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.862
-[man] Good man! get his bib?
-[chuckles softly]

04:38.945 --> 04:40.405
Thank you.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.323
-[Lois laughs]
-Well, now you've...

04:42.407 --> 04:44.200
seen me in a bib. [chuckles]

04:44.284 --> 04:48.038
-Uh-huh?
-So, I'm, uh, just gonna leave
before this gets any worse.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.080
Goodbye forever.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.457
[glass shatters]

04:50.582 --> 04:52.709
Uh, sorry.
I'll fix the front door later!

04:53.585 --> 04:55.003
I can't believe we're late.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.213
I can't believe
our alarm clock exploded again.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.299
Why do you think
that keeps happening?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.593
So, hey! Our... Our...
[clears throat] Our first day
at the Daily Planet.

05:01.718 --> 05:02.802
[chuckles] You nervous?

05:02.927 --> 05:04.012
Ha! I am pumped.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.806
It's Kent and Olsen,
uncovering truths.

05:06.931 --> 05:07.974
Wait! Uh, Jimmy--

05:08.099 --> 05:09.809
Like the fact that
aliens walk among us.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.269
-And there it is.
-[camera shutter clicking]

05:11.353 --> 05:13.021
Aliens, Loch Ness, Bigfoot...

05:13.104 --> 05:14.773
-[Clark grunting]
-...that one
psychic starfish from Germany.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.858
-[Clark shudders]
-[Jimmy] It's all real.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.109
[truck horn honking]

05:20.904 --> 05:22.447
[engine whirring]

05:22.572 --> 05:26.951
And with my keen eye
for observation, huh,
I'll get the proof.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.286
Don't worry.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.330
I'll tell our boss all of this
the instant we meet him.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.623
[sighs] Jimmy...

05:31.748 --> 05:33.041
I'm just gonna
cut him off and say--

05:33.124 --> 05:34.626
Stolen military robots

05:34.751 --> 05:36.378
-are being hidden here
in Metropolis...
-[coughing]

05:36.461 --> 05:38.797
-...and I've got the scoop.
-Lane.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.466
Mt. Simonson Base
is the inventory warehouse

05:41.549 --> 05:43.093
for experimental
military projects,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.053
and a day ago they got robbed.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.846
The only road out
leads through Metropolis,

05:46.971 --> 05:49.683
which means thieves
with dangerous war machines

05:49.808 --> 05:51.851
are loose in our city.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.853
People need to know about this.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.021
So...

05:55.146 --> 05:57.273
Ready for me
to bust the story wide open?

05:57.357 --> 06:00.110
No. Lois, you're an intern.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.154
The only reason I called you
in today was to meet them.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.073
-Hi.
-You?

06:05.156 --> 06:06.616
[gasps] You.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.493
These are the new interns.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.828
I want you to show them
the ropes and get--

06:09.953 --> 06:11.371
They can help me
with the story.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.997
Oh, have you considered
that these robots

06:13.081 --> 06:15.000
might have come from
beyond the stars?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.668
Uh, they came
from an army base.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.503
There's only so many places
to hide them.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.713
-I've already got a lead.
-[gasps]

06:19.838 --> 06:20.922
It could be
the sewer dinosaurs.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.008
-So we follow up...
-Moth Man.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.175
Meet my source...

06:24.300 --> 06:25.552
Merpeople! Merpeople!

06:25.677 --> 06:27.554
-Find the robots...
-And get the story.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.431
Then what are we
waiting around here for?

06:31.516 --> 06:34.102
Uh, donut, Mr. White?
[chuckles nervously]

06:34.185 --> 06:35.687
Chief? [chuckles]

06:35.812 --> 06:39.399
New interns, out.
Old intern, stay.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.400
[chuckles nervously]

06:40.525 --> 06:42.110
[Clark exclaims nervously]

06:42.193 --> 06:44.946
You do not report the news.
You do not leave this building.

06:45.030 --> 06:49.534
Your job is to teach
the interns how to scan things
and make coffee.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.369
That's it.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.913
-Mr. White,
for the good of Metropolis--
-For the good of me,

06:54.039 --> 06:57.125
you need to stop coming in
with these wild ideas.

06:57.207 --> 06:59.210
Do what I tell you to do.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.339
Lane, this is your last chance.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.506
[door slams]

07:03.590 --> 07:04.716
[sighs]

07:05.342 --> 07:06.301
Are you okay?

07:06.384 --> 07:07.719
I can apologize to Mr. White,

07:07.844 --> 07:09.471
if... if that'll help.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.390
[chuckles] Are you kidding?

07:12.474 --> 07:14.142
He kept me behind
because he wants you

07:14.225 --> 07:17.604
to help me follow up
on my stolen robot story.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.647
Really? [exhales]
He seemed pretty upset.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.149
Nah, that's just his face.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.902
You wanna impress Mr. White,
this is our chance.

07:23.985 --> 07:24.986
Let's go.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.239
You like her.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.491
No. What?

07:29.574 --> 07:31.618
I mean, I...
I admire Miss Lane.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.495
Yeah, you do. [chuckles]

07:33.578 --> 07:36.081
As professionals, Jimmy.
Professionals.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.665
Well, come on, Kent.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.918
Just take a risk.
What's the worst
that could happen?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.672
[door squeaking]

07:49.052 --> 07:49.928
[Badger sighs]

07:50.053 --> 07:52.222
-Don't touch that.
-[gasps]

07:52.305 --> 07:53.640
What took you so long, Willis?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.016
The crew was getting restless.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.976
Our fence wasn't
at the drop point.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.728
We have no buyer.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.730
-What the...
-It gets better.

08:00.814 --> 08:05.110
Every buyer, fixer,
or fence in Metropolis
has just disappeared on us.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.194
We're stuck here.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.238
Leslie, we can't just sit
in a warehouse

08:08.321 --> 08:11.157
full of freaky stolen
science weapons
till the cops show up.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.451
We don't even know
what half this stuff is.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.619
What are we going to do?

08:14.703 --> 08:16.162
I don't know, Badger.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.789
Why don't we panic real loud
in front of the thieves

08:17.914 --> 08:19.874
and killers we hired
for this job?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.129
What we need
to do is keep moving.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.132
-If we can find
a way out of town, then I--
-[robotic whirring]

08:27.257 --> 08:30.760
[loud thudding]

08:32.345 --> 08:33.221
[whimpering]

08:33.304 --> 08:35.432
[robot trilling]

08:35.515 --> 08:36.558
[woman gasps]

08:38.476 --> 08:39.561
[crashing]

08:42.981 --> 08:46.234
Which one of you messed
with the robot?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.236
Mmm. Looks like Brad.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.362
Listen up, people.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.822
We've hit a snag
in the operation.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.159
Do what I say
and we can still get paid.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.370
Fail to do so
and you end up like Brad.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.122
Suit up and load the trucks.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.665
Time for Plan B.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.959
[Clark] What are we doing?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.502
We're meeting my important

09:04.627 --> 09:07.047
and very serious
journalistic source.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.799
Flip Johnson,
woman of business.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.012
[laughs] This is precious.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.890
Flip is one of the Planet's
newspaper delivery kids.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.184
We call ourselves
the Newskid Legion.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.977
-And because they--
-I'm the leader.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.230
And because they see
everything during their routes,

09:24.356 --> 09:27.192
they always know
what's happening in the city.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.986
Flip, these robots
would have been--

09:30.070 --> 09:34.616
Ms. Lane, while I appreciate
your past English tutoring,

09:34.699 --> 09:36.910
it's bad business
to hand out freebies.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.745
I need something in return.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.331
-Like what?
-I'm glad you asked.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.917
We need your help
with The Newskid Newspaper.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.502
The Newskid Newspaper

09:45.585 --> 09:46.920
is the latest from us,

09:47.045 --> 09:48.546
the people on the street.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.881
Big Words does the puzzle.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.174
Gaby does the op-ed.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.009
Patti does the cartoons,

09:53.093 --> 09:55.220
but only because Mom says
we have to be nice to her.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.388
[laughing and grunting]

09:56.471 --> 09:58.014
And I'm the editor.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.017
We want Perry
to let us deliver
our paper with his.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.062
So, if you were to ask for us,

10:04.187 --> 10:06.815
and maybe also help me
on my next three
English essays--

10:06.898 --> 10:10.443
-One essay.
-Two, and there will be snacks.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.153
Deal.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.864
Okay, in the last 24 hours,
a water main burst at the bank,

10:14.948 --> 10:17.242
they got rats
over at Bogdanov's diner,

10:17.367 --> 10:19.911
-Mrs. Jurgens eloped
with the superintendent.
-[cat snarls]

10:20.036 --> 10:22.247
Gaby saw a bunch of trucks
running a red light.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.083
And I saw a weird pigeon.
It was gross.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.085
Wait, were they garbage trucks?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.253
Yeah. Why?

10:31.214 --> 10:34.300
Hmm. If I had
to transport stolen goods
through the city...

10:34.426 --> 10:38.096
I'd find a way
to do it in plain sight.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.765
Okay. Where did you guys
see the trucks?

10:40.849 --> 10:43.768
And where exactly
did you see them disappear?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.318
Uh, wait.
Lois, this is starting
to feel dangerous

10:52.444 --> 10:55.155
for you and Jimmy.
And, uh, to me, too.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.700
Are you sure that
Mr. White is okay
with us following this?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.952
-Oh.
-[cell phone rings]

11:01.036 --> 11:03.705
[notifications dinging]

11:05.457 --> 11:07.792
[whispers] Yeah,
that was him just now. Uh...

11:07.876 --> 11:09.878
He said he can't wait
to see our story.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.005
Ooh! Over here. Over here.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.801
[sighs] We have to get inside.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.970
-Boost me up.
-[chuckles] Uh, what?

11:19.054 --> 11:22.098
Just lift me up. [shrieks]

11:22.182 --> 11:24.684
You're, like, twice my size.
You can definitely... [gasps]

11:24.809 --> 11:25.894
[exclaiming in fear]

11:25.977 --> 11:27.896
[yells, gasps]

11:29.647 --> 11:31.316
Are you okay?

11:31.399 --> 11:35.487
-Yeah, I'm... Uh, I'm...
-[Jimmy] Guys!

11:35.612 --> 11:37.197
[exclaims nervously]

11:37.322 --> 11:39.657
We don't have to go
through the window,
or whisper.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.368
-[door creaks]
-The door's unlocked.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.744
Oh, that's not good.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.497
[Lois] No!

11:45.622 --> 11:47.832
The robots should be here.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.126
Look around.
There has to be something.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.921
[objects clattering]

11:56.424 --> 11:57.884
Oh, look!

11:58.343 --> 11:59.928
"PM."

12:00.011 --> 12:01.805
PM could be initials, like...

12:01.888 --> 12:03.515
Paranormal Meta-sapiens!

12:03.598 --> 12:05.183
It's the term for
the super-intelligent gorillas

12:05.308 --> 12:06.685
-France has been hiding.
-[cell phone vibrates]

12:06.810 --> 12:08.978
-Maybe part of a uniform.
-A French one.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.689
-It's not gorillas.
-I know what I'm talking about.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.357
-And it's not Merpeople.
-PM.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.442
-[Lois] And it's definitely...
-Uh, hello? Clark Kent here.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.152
[Perry on phone] I know
Lane is dodging me,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.530
so I'm gonna tell you
what I texted her.

12:18.613 --> 12:22.409
All three of you
need to get back
to the Planet right now,

12:22.534 --> 12:24.828
or don't bother
coming back at all.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.121
[call disconnects]

12:27.664 --> 12:28.915
[Lois] Port of Metropolis.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.834
This is from
a dockworker's jacket.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.461
They're moving
the robots to the docks.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.796
Come on, we can catch them,

12:34.879 --> 12:35.714
-and then we can--
-Perry just called.

12:35.797 --> 12:36.965
[gasps]

12:37.841 --> 12:41.052
Lois, you lied.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.680
I mean, technically, yes,
but you wouldn't have helped me

12:43.763 --> 12:46.808
-if I told the truth.
-[Clark] You didn't
give us the chance.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.102
Because this was too important.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.687
The people of Metropolis
need to know

12:50.770 --> 12:52.188
what's happening
in their city, and--

12:52.272 --> 12:54.774
This isn't about the city,
Lois, it's about you.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.360
I trusted you,
and you used me and Jimmy

12:57.444 --> 12:59.487
just so you could get
your story.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.323
Come on, Clark. We're a team.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.200
We're not a team.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.910
We're just two dummies
who listened to you

13:05.994 --> 13:07.162
because we didn't know
any better.

13:07.829 --> 13:08.913
Now we do.

13:10.957 --> 13:14.252
Fine. I don't need
your help anyway.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.211
Oh!

13:21.760 --> 13:23.470
I can't believe him.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.181
What is wrong
with your dumb, beautiful,
coward of a best friend?

13:26.264 --> 13:28.016
Clark's just... You know,
he just grew up in a--

13:28.099 --> 13:30.602
Wait, did you say "beautiful"?

13:30.685 --> 13:32.062
[Lois] And then he says
I'm the selfish one.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.480
-[Flip] Hmm.
-I mean, yes, I lied.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.398
But he wouldn't have helped me
unless I had.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.108
Not like he helped
that old lady with the bib,

13:37.233 --> 13:39.277
or... or helped me with Flip,

13:39.402 --> 13:41.946
or... or brought
everyone doughnuts,

13:42.030 --> 13:44.616
or... I was being selfish.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.076
Uh, Lois?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.036
-I got him fired
from his dream job.
-Lois!

13:48.119 --> 13:49.704
All to chase a bunch of robots

13:49.788 --> 13:52.082
-that might not even be
in the city anymore?
-Lois!

13:52.165 --> 13:53.333
-Whoa!
-[crane whirring]

13:54.042 --> 13:56.252
[dramatic music playing]

13:57.754 --> 13:59.923
We found the robots.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.925
[Lois] And the people
who stole them.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.052
Huh? Hey!

14:06.471 --> 14:07.555
-[gun cocks]
-[both scream]

14:08.848 --> 14:11.142
Someone take care of this.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.019
-[mechanism chimes]
-[hatch buzzes]

14:19.484 --> 14:20.652
[Leslie grunts]

14:22.362 --> 14:23.530
[groans]

14:23.613 --> 14:27.200
Why would you use the robot?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.870
[both panting]

14:32.038 --> 14:34.415
-[gasps]
-[rumbling]

14:35.834 --> 14:36.918
[gasps]

14:38.795 --> 14:39.963
[Flip panting]

14:40.046 --> 14:41.006
Clark!

14:41.131 --> 14:42.549
[panting] Lois was right.

14:42.674 --> 14:46.011
Ugh. I know. She did lie,
but would I have helped her

14:46.136 --> 14:47.262
if she told me the truth?

14:47.345 --> 14:48.972
I... I don't think I would.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.682
[chuckles] And what does that
say about me?

14:50.807 --> 14:51.808
[Flip] Not that.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.768
Lois and Jimmy found the robots

14:53.852 --> 14:55.311
and the robots turned on them.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.605
What do we do?
Should we call Perry?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.441
The President? My mom?

14:59.524 --> 15:01.067
[whooshing]

15:02.610 --> 15:03.486
Clark?

15:06.656 --> 15:07.866
[Lois grunts]

15:07.991 --> 15:09.576
Okay. I think we lost them.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.619
[both scream]

15:12.996 --> 15:15.707
[Jimmy screaming]

15:15.832 --> 15:16.708
[Lois exclaims]

15:17.917 --> 15:19.044
Clark, you came back.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.712
I... We... We...
We have to go get Jimmy.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.007
Guys! Run!

15:25.342 --> 15:26.885
-Clark!
-[Jimmy panting]

15:26.968 --> 15:28.720
-[grunts]
-[Clark grunts]

15:28.803 --> 15:30.597
-Ahh!
-Clark!

15:30.722 --> 15:31.765
[Lois] No!

15:31.890 --> 15:33.099
[Jimmy screams]

15:36.227 --> 15:38.063

16:01.378 --> 16:02.253

16:54.806 --> 16:57.726
-Well, I didn't plan for this.
-[Badger gasps]

16:57.809 --> 16:59.310
Badger, I need you to--

17:00.603 --> 17:03.148
Fine, new plan.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.566
-[Leslie grunting]
-[hatches buzzing]

17:10.155 --> 17:12.615

17:16.703 --> 17:17.537

Who are you?

19:31.755 --> 19:32.797
[whooshes]

19:35.133 --> 19:36.217
Clark!

19:42.098 --> 19:45.602
[sighs] A normal man
having a normal day, huh?

19:49.481 --> 19:51.858
-Who am I?
-[Lois] Clark!

19:52.901 --> 19:54.235
[yelling] Clark!

19:54.319 --> 19:56.905
[grunting]

20:00.992 --> 20:03.328
Clark! Clark!

20:03.411 --> 20:04.829
I'm sorry I lied.
You were right.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.290
I was being selfish,
and you just left us.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.708
But you came back, and...

20:08.833 --> 20:10.794
And I'm sorry.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.587
[Jimmy] Clark?

20:12.671 --> 20:15.006
-[laughing] Clark!
-[Clark groans]

20:15.090 --> 20:16.591
You're okay!

20:16.675 --> 20:18.760
Jimmy, please
tell me you got that.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.011
Every second of it.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.555
I have pictures of a man
flying through the air.

20:22.681 --> 20:23.932
He's gotta be an alien.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.976
Everything I've ever
believed in is real!

20:27.060 --> 20:29.813
Uh, you...
You got pictures of the fight?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.107
This is the story
of the century.

20:32.190 --> 20:36.945
Stolen military robots,
taken down by a Superman.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.073
Oh, when we show this
to Perry, he's gonna say--

20:40.198 --> 20:41.449
This is garbage.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.785
Mr. White, this is gold.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.246
What you brought me
is a bunch of blurry pictures

20:46.371 --> 20:48.289
-of robots falling.
-Phew.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.834
What on earth
were you thinking?

20:50.917 --> 20:54.170
And you dragged
my brand new interns into this.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.547
[Clark] It's the truth.

20:55.630 --> 20:56.881
Lois was right
about the robots,

20:57.007 --> 20:59.134
and we all stand by
the story we broke,

20:59.217 --> 21:00.552
because we're a team.

21:00.635 --> 21:01.720
[Lois clears throat]

21:01.803 --> 21:02.929
Uh, sir.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.182
All the interns out.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.936
Go. I'll figure out
what to do with you tomorrow.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.354
We're not fired?

21:11.438 --> 21:13.148
Does that mean
you'll run our story, Chief?

21:13.231 --> 21:16.443
I'll run your story on the day
you get me a photo shoot

21:16.568 --> 21:19.279
with your very real
"Flying Man."

21:19.404 --> 21:21.573
-Now, out!
-[door slams]

21:22.532 --> 21:23.867
[Lois] Hmm.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.078
-Lois?
-Whoo! This is great.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.956
We just have to get
an exclusive interview
with Superman,

21:30.081 --> 21:32.542
and then Mr. White
will have to take us seriously.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.087
-That's your takeaway
from all this?
-Yup!

21:36.212 --> 21:40.091
And... And I promise,
from now on, no more secrets.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.844
You in, Clark?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.888
Of course, Lois.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.348
[chuckles] Yes!

21:46.431 --> 21:47.891
And no matter where he goes,

21:47.974 --> 21:51.770
no matter where he hides,
we will track Superman down

21:51.853 --> 21:55.065
and force him
to tell us all his secrets.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.649
And then we'll publish them.

21:56.775 --> 21:59.986
[chuckles] This is
the best day of my life!
