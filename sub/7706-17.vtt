And you won't let me eat cats.

Take it easy, Jake.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.180
I have a distinct
feeling those sirens

02:28.182 --> 02:30.115
have something to do with ALF.

Hello?

02:45.132 --> 02:46.532
Dad, it's ALF.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.034
Would you tell him
to come in here

02:49.036 --> 02:51.670
if he wants to talk to me?

02:51.672 --> 02:54.039
Dad said that you're
gonna have to come in here

02:54.041 --> 02:55.707
if you want to talk to him.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.511

I don't know, ALF.
What have you done?

As you may have gathered, Willie

03:37.418 --> 03:39.751
I'm in big trouble.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.355
You're always in trouble.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.090
Yeah, but even on the ALF scale

03:45.092 --> 03:47.159
this one's a humdinger.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.261
I need help.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.996
What happened, ALF?

03:50.998 --> 03:54.866
Long story short, I saw
a burglar at the Ochmonek's

03:54.868 --> 03:56.535
and scared him away.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.438
Now, I'm trapped
and I'm scared.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.574
Oh, the irony of it all.

Well, can't you
make a run for it?

04:05.579 --> 04:09.181

of "Butch Cassidy" either.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.117
No, I didn't.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.952
But you've got
to do something, ALF.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.188
They might storm the house.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.290
Oh, yeah.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.359
I've got hostages in here!

04:21.962 --> 04:23.362
Think that'll hold them?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.697
Or should I say that
the hostages are nuns?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.600
No nuns. None.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.437
- I'm coming over.
- Okay, but hurry!

I don't think these guys will
give you much of a grace period

04:35.209 --> 04:37.209

04:39.046 --> 04:41.146
ALF's trapped at the Ochmonek's.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.215
I know the feeling.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.085
- I-I-I'm going over.
- Me too.

No, you're, you're,
you're staying here.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.222
It's too dangerous.

Yeah, you might lose your cool

04:53.627 --> 04:56.161
Bullets? There'll be bullets?

Jake, that is ridiculous.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.899
Willie, be careful.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.868
Oh, uh, I will.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.005
By the way, how did
"Butch Cassidy" end?

05:08.275 --> 05:11.009
They were gunned down
by the Bolivian army.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.844
Yeah, it was really cool.

go in there, are you?

he's got hostages.

we're Americans.

Go get pizzas.

They like pepperoni. Probably.

Alright, we're
getting the pizzas.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.596
Relax.

don't do the crime.

that on a pot holder.

Don't worry, Bri.
ALF is<i> not</i> going to jail.

Though a short sentence
might do him good.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.434
Dad, is ALF gonna be alright?

09:29.436 --> 09:31.436
Well, the house is surrounded.

There's a mob outside
and the SWAT team's on its way.

Uh, the Ochmonek's aren't here

09:38.912 --> 09:41.780
and if you don't mind,
I'm a little busy right now.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.549
ALF, wait! Wait!
It's me, it's Willie.

09:44.551 --> 09:47.152
Prove it.
What's your middle name?

09:48.855 --> 09:50.789
Francis.

Francis?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.091

09:53.093 --> 09:55.560
Well, no wonder
you never told me.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.798
Alright, alright.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.867
Sorry, Willie, I'm panicking.

10:02.869 --> 10:06.204
Listen, ALF, there's
a SWAT team on its way.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.975
Well, that calmed me right down.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.916
This is Doug Gould,
Channel 6 news.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.152
I'm reporting live
from 169 Hemdale Avenue.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.121
Doug Gould?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.956
That blow-dried vulture?

10:26.226 --> 10:28.660
This seemingly
calm suburban street

Oh, wait, why am I worried?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.168

10:38.438 --> 10:41.506
In this house, an undetermined
number of hostages

10:41.508 --> 10:44.309
are being held
by a deranged gunman.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.144
Who are you calling<i> deranged</i>

10:46.146 --> 10:48.213
you video tapeworm?

10:49.916 --> 10:52.851
With me now
is Officer Izzy Griswald

10:52.853 --> 10:55.787
who was the first policeman
on the scene.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.690
(ALF)
'Hey, copper,
where are those pizzas?'

11:00.327 --> 11:03.595
Officer Griswald what can you
tell us about the hostages?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.665
They're hungry.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.969
Actually, we don't
know who the hostages are

11:10.971 --> 11:13.371
but we believe
they're unharmed.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.606
That's good news.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.708
Except from
a ratings standpoint.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.043
[chuckles]

11:20.547 --> 11:22.247
- Sir..
- Hmm?

11:26.820 --> 11:29.621
The food is here.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.857
Excuse me.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.527
That was Officer Izzy Griswald

11:35.529 --> 11:39.397
who is in charge
of the operation, a..

11:39.399 --> 11:41.366
And, uh, who might you be?

11:41.368 --> 11:44.569
I'm Mrs. Byrd, Myrna Byrd,
148 Hemdale.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.904
I'm Doug Gould.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.472
Yes, I watch
your show all the time.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.240
Oh-ho, you know my work?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.176
I know it and hate it.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.878
We'll be back after
this word from Arby's.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.416
Now you were saying?

11:58.418 --> 12:00.085
No need to elaborate!

12:00.087 --> 12:03.088
Your reporting is nothing but
thinly disguised sensationalism

12:03.090 --> 12:05.690
marauding in the vestments
of mock human interest

12:05.692 --> 12:07.092
peppered with innuendo

12:07.094 --> 12:09.094
and served with saccharin
superciliousness

12:09.096 --> 12:12.864
and a blatant disregard
of substantive prima-tertia.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.032
But you're awfully cute.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.735
How about a one-night stand?

12:16.737 --> 12:19.237
Think about it.
I'm a widow.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.409
It's gonna be a long night.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.777
How come?

12:25.779 --> 12:27.779
Is this the night
we set the clocks back?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.351
(ALF)
'Hey! What's going
on out there?'

12:33.353 --> 12:35.787
Some of us think we smell pizza.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.288
Don't we, guys?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.257
[imitating hostage]
Yeah, smells like pizza to me.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.025
[imitating hostage]
Me too. I smell it.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.027
[imitating hostage]
Wish we had some.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.631
Yeah, pizza just got here.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.966
Come on out and get it.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.534
(ALF)
'I'll be right out.'

12:49.536 --> 12:50.635
No! No! Don't come out!

12:50.637 --> 12:51.803
Shh!

12:51.805 --> 12:53.738
Oh, yeah. Right.

12:53.740 --> 12:57.909
Hey, we're not hungry anymore.
Are we?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.544
[imitating hostage]
Not me. Couldn't eat a thing.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.046
[imitating hostage]
Wouldn't touch it. Me either.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.649
Shut up!

13:04.651 --> 13:06.151
Thanks for nothing, Tanner.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.419
I can't believe
you just did that.

13:08.421 --> 13:12.824
I just.. I don't want
anybody to get hurt.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.493
I can't believe the pizza
got here before the SWAT team.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.296
You should try waiting
for the coroner sometime.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.464
I have.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.901
You know, maybe this guy

13:22.903 --> 13:25.436
just wants this publicity.

13:25.438 --> 13:29.274
Maybe if we all just leave
he'd let the hostages go.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.010
Yeah, and maybe if we open
the cell doors

13:32.012 --> 13:33.511
the criminals
would just walk in.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.847
Oh, hey, but then,
wouldn't the criminals

13:35.849 --> 13:38.750
that are just already
in there walk out?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.520
Your parents are first cousins,
aren't they?

13:44.691 --> 13:46.958
(Trevor)
'Hey, what's everybody
doing on my lawn?'

13:46.960 --> 13:48.026
- Trevor, Raquel--
- What..

13:48.028 --> 13:49.627
What's going on here?

13:49.629 --> 13:50.962
Who are all these people?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.932
Somebody beheaded
my lawn Santa.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.533
There's a burglar
in your house.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.035
Trevor, he's got a hostages.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.003
Burglar? Hostages?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.005
That's why I left New York.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.541
Excuse me, are you
the owners of this house?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.677
Yeah, that's right. What..

14:05.679 --> 14:07.879
Hey, are we on TV?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.049
(ALF)
'Look at Trevor.'

14:11.051 --> 14:13.918
The camera really
does add 20 pounds.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.055
(Raquel on TV)
'I don't know
why they keep robbing us.'

14:17.057 --> 14:18.890
'There's nothing
left to steal.'

14:18.892 --> 14:22.193
(Trevor on TV)
'Yeah, how come they never break
into the Tanner's over there?'

14:22.195 --> 14:24.295
'That place is ripe
for the picking.'

14:24.297 --> 14:27.799
'They've got a computer,
telescope, a waterpik..

14:29.302 --> 14:31.970
This is like watching
the Home Shopping Network.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.405
Wow! Look at Uncle Trevor!

14:34.407 --> 14:37.408
The camera really
does add 80 pounds.

14:37.410 --> 14:41.012
(male #1 on TV)
'We'll continue live
right after this message.'

14:41.014 --> 14:42.814
The Ochmoneks are coming over.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.949
Oh, ALF,
hide in the kitchen.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.986
I'm losing it.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.021
I'm just so worried about him.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.890
Hello, everybody.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.224
Hey, did you see me on TV?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.927
Yeah, you looked a little puffy.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.495
Well, you know what they say.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.931
TV adds about 140 pounds.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.100
- No, not that much.
- It's true.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.904
Nell Carter is really
the same size as Diana Ross!

15:05.906 --> 15:07.939
Let's not talk about this now.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.376
I-I'm so sorry
that this is happening.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.044
Do you believe our luck?

15:13.046 --> 15:16.614
Why do bad things
happen to good people?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.516
I told you, Raquel.
It's kahma.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.951
What's kahma?

15:19.953 --> 15:22.954
When your lawn Santa is beheaded
for no apparent reason.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.256
Oh, you mean<i> karma.</i>

15:26.393 --> 15:27.926
Why did you decide
to come back?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.460
I thought you were
going to Tijuana.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.429
Well, we were half way there,
when we realized

15:31.431 --> 15:32.964
that we'd left
the door unlocked.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.633
We didn't want
anybody breaking in.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.802
[chuckles]
Now that point is moot.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.137
What's moot?

15:39.139 --> 15:41.439
Would somebody buy
this kid a dictionary?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.642
I hope they catch
that burglar dead or alive.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.411
Don't say that.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.478
[telephone ringing]

15:49.482 --> 15:51.983
Why is he so concerned
with the criminal?

15:51.985 --> 15:53.651
You taught him that,
didn't you?

15:53.653 --> 15:57.155
Hey, I've got better things
to do than to corrupt him.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.223
I'm tryin' to corrupt her.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.060
Mom, it's for you.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.561
Honey, who is it?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.496
It's, uh...Hairy.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.832
Hairy, who?

16:07.834 --> 16:10.468
Hairy Melmacian.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.972
Oh...right.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.810
Make it quick, eh?

16:18.812 --> 16:20.445
I wanna call my insurance agent.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.247
Maybe it's not too late
to get a homeowners policy.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.185
Hello, Hairy.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.921
Hi, Too-Much-Rouge.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.591
So, how is it going?

16:33.593 --> 16:36.694
Fine, I've met a lot
of nice new people

16:36.696 --> 16:38.429
who wanna<i> kill</i> me.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.366
That's nice.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.369
Oh, I'm glad you're
taking it so well.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.137
Uh, I-I really can't talk
right now.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.039
We have...company.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.508
Oh, you invited people over.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.512
Hey, hey, I wouldn't want you
to stop living because I might.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.182
We didn't invite them.
They just dropped by.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.286
Well, excuse us
for being under siege.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.189
Um..

17:05.191 --> 17:06.858
Uh, Willie hasn't
forgotten about you.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.559
I'm sure we'll be
seeing you soon.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.994
Okay, Hairy?

17:09.996 --> 17:11.729
Do I have the right number?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.965
Yes. Goodbye.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.467
[sighs]

17:17.637 --> 17:20.071
Do I use too much rouge?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.306
I always thought so.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.143
[clears throat]

17:25.145 --> 17:27.912
Sir, SWAT team
will be here in five minutes.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.313
What's taking 'em so long?

17:29.315 --> 17:31.549
They stormed
the wrong house by mistake.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.086
Alright, in five minutes

17:35.088 --> 17:37.355
this place is gonna be
raining burglar.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.257
- No.
- Tanner, come back here.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.426
- Fire at will!
- No! No!

17:41.428 --> 17:43.761
Hold your fire.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.164
Sorry. I thought
I was back in Nam.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.333
Who are you?

17:54.007 --> 17:56.074
Oh, Willie, Willie.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.409
I'm so glad to see you.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.678
It's okay, ALF.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.680
It-it-it's okay.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.682
What's your plan?

18:04.684 --> 18:06.918
I-I don't have a plan.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.388
There are enough people in here
without a plan, right, guys?

18:10.390 --> 18:14.058
[imitating hostage]
You said it. Absolutely.
We're sunk.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.462
Don't do that for my benefit.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.965
[imitating hostage]
Sorry. Sorry. No problem.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.068
Look, ALF, we've
gotta do something.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.304
Well, why don't you
wrap me around your neck

18:26.306 --> 18:28.106
and tell 'em
I'm a fur stole.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.709
Hey, hey, I'm not married
to that idea.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.712
[radio static]

18:34.714 --> 18:35.880
Testing, testing.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.115
Can you hear me?

18:37.117 --> 18:38.783
Yeah, I can hear you, Willie.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.220
But this is no time
to play block captain.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.923
No, no, ALF. I've got it.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.658
I've got an idea.

18:47.660 --> 18:52.296
All we need, all we need
is a place for you to hide.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.333
[Jamaican accent]
How about Jamaica, maan?

18:56.603 --> 18:57.835
Give me a minute.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.439
(Griswald on megaphone)
'This is your last chance.'

19:01.441 --> 19:03.941
'Come out with your hands up.'

19:03.943 --> 19:07.778
I'm telling you, coppers,
you'll never take me alive.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.846
Ha!

19:10.683 --> 19:12.483
What a stupid threat?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.422
Get in the hamper.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.692
But Raquel's unmentionables
are in there.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.661
Just get in the hamper.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.098
And keep making those silly
demands on your walkie-talkie.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.600
Forget it.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.303
(Griswald on megaphone)
'If you don't
surrender immediately'

19:32.305 --> 19:35.273
'we are dispersing
the tear gas.'

19:35.275 --> 19:38.409
(all)
Tear gas! Tear gas! Tear gas!

19:39.512 --> 19:42.246
I'm getting in before
they start to harmonize.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.353
This is either gonna work or..

19:49.355 --> 19:51.689
Well, let's not
think about that.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.894
Whoa! How bad
does tear gas smell?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.396
Get down.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.799
Did I mention to you
that I'm claustrophobic?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.201
I am!

20:08.541 --> 20:09.574
[sighs]

20:12.712 --> 20:14.145
Oh.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.417
Wait! Don't shoot!

20:19.419 --> 20:21.319
He's-he's not here.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.920
Hold your fire.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.923
And I don't want to hear
anything out of you, lady.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.658
We're coming in.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.234
Upstairs.

20:36.236 --> 20:40.204
You see, the burglar's
just not<i> here.</i>

20:40.206 --> 20:42.206
He's got to be here.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.208
We have the place surrounded.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.343
[clears throat]

20:45.345 --> 20:46.677
(ALF on radio)
'O-okay, uh..'

20:46.679 --> 20:48.913
'...I'll now make
a list of my demands.'

20:48.915 --> 20:50.181
Everybody, down!

20:50.183 --> 20:52.049
'I want a million dollars'

20:52.051 --> 20:55.519
'a-and a DC-10 with those
little bags of peanuts.'

20:55.521 --> 20:57.622
'You know,
the honey-roasted kind.'

20:57.624 --> 21:00.124
The voice is coming
from this walkie-talkie.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.293
That's right.
He's not in the house.

21:02.295 --> 21:06.297
He's just been broadcasting his
demands over the walkie-talkie.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.633
He must have escaped
before we got here.

21:08.635 --> 21:12.069
(ALF)
'And for the in-flight meal,
I want the filet mignon.'

21:12.071 --> 21:16.207
[imitating hostage]
'I'll have chicken. I'll take
the fish. Kosher for me.'

21:16.209 --> 21:17.608
(ALF)
'Oy!'

21:19.612 --> 21:21.279
Well, how did
a goofball like this

21:21.281 --> 21:23.714
come up
with such a clever plan?

21:23.716 --> 21:25.783
Oh, you really
think it's clever?

21:27.420 --> 21:29.920
No burglar, no hostages.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.756
We did find a bunch
of bank pens, though.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.625
- Hmm.
- Can I keep these?

21:34.627 --> 21:37.161
Take them out to the car
and log 'em as evidence.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.629
Okay.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.832
And I'll turn back the clock.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.337
Alright, he's probably
still in the area.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.406
You guys
search the neighborhood.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.743
[sighs]

21:54.013 --> 21:55.346
Oh and, Tanner..

21:56.482 --> 21:57.682
...thanks for all your help.

21:57.684 --> 22:00.685
- Oh.
- You got a lot of guts.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.354
You deserve
to be block captain.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.690
Thank you.
Thank you, sir, and..

22:05.692 --> 22:07.325
Now, goodbye.

22:07.327 --> 22:10.428
I'll just, uh...tidy up.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.563
[clicking tongue]

22:14.534 --> 22:16.300
It's okay, ALF,
you're safe now.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.835
[ALF gasp]

22:17.837 --> 22:19.603
[vase shattering]

22:19.605 --> 22:22.039
Just blame that on the burglar.

22:22.041 --> 22:25.009
Back down! I've got
to carry you home now.

22:25.011 --> 22:29.013
Hey, it's not like this hamper
is Jamaica, maan.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.282
- Get down, maan.
- Oh.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.954
Oh, hi, Trevor, Raquel.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.989
What are you doing
with our laundry?

22:38.991 --> 22:42.560
Well, I-I thought I'd wash it.

22:42.562 --> 22:46.030
It's the least I can do
after all you've been through.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.531
Thanks, Willie.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.534
Alright, let's hear it
for Willie Tanner !

22:50.536 --> 22:53.371
(in unison)
Willie! Willie! Willie!

22:53.373 --> 22:56.006
Uh, uh, thank you.
Uh, thank you.

22:56.008 --> 22:59.977
(ALF)
'Psst. Willie, don't stop
to sign any autographs, maan.'

22:59.979 --> 23:01.746
I hear you, maan.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.716
(in unison)
Willie! Willie! Willie!

23:08.921 --> 23:10.955
[instrumental music]

23:14.260 --> 23:15.760
Hey, ALF,
what are you doing?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.728
I'm putting
the finishing touches

23:17.730 --> 23:20.865
on the ALF Home Security System.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.334
Now, this place will be
burglar proof.

23:23.336 --> 23:25.503
[alarm wailing]

23:27.707 --> 23:29.006
Wow!

23:31.577 --> 23:34.078
ALF, turn it off!

23:35.848 --> 23:37.114
Off?

23:37.116 --> 23:39.850
[wailing continues]

23:43.456 --> 23:46.457
[theme music]
