when we worked together.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.773
A story clear as mud.

12:54.023 --> 12:58.152
Hey, excuse me, Andy, for only rollin' you
a ground ball on who did your homicide.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.237
What, are you pissed off
I'm not taking you by the hand,

13:00.321 --> 13:03.199
-so you can go down and tag first?
-What's this Kenny's last name?

13:03.616 --> 13:07.328
Sorrell. One "S," two "Ls."

13:07.828 --> 13:11.373
Here's a full list of particulars.
Plus, where to grab him up.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.465
Hey, Bobby, I gave this guy some tune-up
back in April.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.425
I mean, I thought I put him on dialysis.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.303
Yeah, it's, uh, tough
gettin' through to a cokehead.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.515
-Try explainin' that to your partner.
-BOBBY: I'mma go do that right now.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.687
-Mind if I buy myself a cup of coffee?
-Then we're gonna be pretty busy, Mike.

13:34.063 --> 13:38.484
Oh, well, then I'll take my leave.
I mean, I don't need to get hit by a bus.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.325
Last heard from him three weeks ago?
Roberts' story proves dick.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.161
-You gotta like the guy a little, Andy.
-Like him a little? Yeah,

13:49.328 --> 13:51.372
-but he's no ground ball.
-(BREATHES DEEPLY)

13:53.374 --> 13:56.001
You know, this happens to be
a lousy neighborhood.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.878
We'll be all right.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.131
That, uh, oriental girl
who's colleagues of the DOA

14:01.298 --> 14:02.633
is comin' in or a statement later.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.718
She went to their school, uh,

14:04.802 --> 14:07.429
wanted to tell the DOA students herself
what happened to him.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.765
And we took a message off
the DOA's answering machine.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.725
It might be good.
Some guy named Kenny

14:11.851 --> 14:13.185
sayin' that they, uh, gotta talk.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.646
Roberts gave us a push
on a Kenny for a homicide.

14:15.771 --> 14:19.316
I hear, uh, Kenny's voice
is on the son's answering machine?

14:20.651 --> 14:24.280
-Ready to give it up to me a little, Andy?
-Yeah. Have some of this.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.532
-Yeah, right.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

14:26.657 --> 14:29.034
And if he is right, it's by accident.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.497
Andy.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.647
-Hello there, Dolores.
-Hey, hi.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.610
-Uh... John Irvin.
-Yeah, I remember.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.030
So, how's your computer graphics business
going?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.616
-Can we make a pact, Dolores?
-What?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.410
If I buy you a Christmas tree this year,
will you promise never to mention

15:11.577 --> 15:14.496
-my computer graphics business again?
-Not going so good, huh?

15:14.663 --> 15:16.081
I think I may be holding the record

15:16.165 --> 15:19.335
for the quickest bankruptcy filing
in the Manhattan district court.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.047
But, uh, excelsior,
I am back in the Borough PAA pool.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.549
They got me temping upstairs today
in Anti-crime, which I love.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.511
-Detective Russell, how goes the battle?
-Hey, John. John Irvin used to be our PAA.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.388
-Jill Kirkendall, good to meet you, John.
-JOHN: How do you do?

15:31.472 --> 15:33.807
Detective, she'd like to report
an incident.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.435
Something happened to me last night.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.063
Uh... Let me excuse myself.
I just wanted to say hi.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.356
-Take care, John.
-Take care.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.902
-What's your name?
-Um... Nina Nuñez.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.447
(INHALES) I'm, uh, Jill Kirkendall.
This is my partner Diane Russell.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.949
Were you just at Bellevue hospital, Nina?

15:50.741 --> 15:51.784
I left, though.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.827
-JILL: Let's talk back here.
-DIANE: Yeah.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.705
We'll get you something to drink.
And something to eat, if you want.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.999
I don't know if I can keep it down.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.339
JILL: Here you go.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.469
(CLEARS THROAT) The, um...

16:12.388 --> 16:15.683
The doctor at Bellevue said
you told him you'd been raped.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.644
That's what happened
till 4:00 this morning.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.730
-By someone you knew?
-No, he just jumped out at me.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.065
Did you get a look at him?

16:23.774 --> 16:25.859
Not really. Black.

16:26.568 --> 16:31.115
-And where was this?
-I... I don't know. My memory's foggy.

16:31.198 --> 16:34.243
-Tell us what you do remember.
-He... he pulled me in the car

16:34.410 --> 16:38.080
and... and put a cloth
over my face that made me dizzy.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.167
And then, I... I woke up,
and he was trying to rape me.

16:42.376 --> 16:45.796
Then I woke up again,
and I was at the steps at my school.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.633
Then I went to the hospital,
and then I came here.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.052
-Who do you live with, Nina?
-My mom.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.013
Have you called her yet?

16:55.305 --> 16:57.182
Is your mom pretty strict with you?

16:59.059 --> 17:02.146
Being detectives, Nina,
sometimes we see girls

17:02.229 --> 17:06.066
whose parents are strict.
Get so worried over being out late,

17:06.150 --> 17:09.445
that they come to us with a story
that's not completely true.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.197
If that's what's happened here, Nina,
we're not gonna put you in any trouble,

17:12.322 --> 17:15.242
but we don't want to start
an investigation for no reason.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.119
It's the truth. I got attacked.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.414
-That's why I was out late.
-Okay. Okay, Nina.

17:20.622 --> 17:23.125
We're gonna call your mother now,
let her know what happened.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.461
Okay.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.588
Do you want to call,
or do you want us to call?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.299
You.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.680
JILL: Write your mom's number.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.782
Yes, well, the purchasing group
that I represent needs to make

17:54.865 --> 17:58.494
an appraisal for each of the apartments'
fixtures and appliances, and so forth,

17:58.577 --> 18:01.747
-before we make an offer on the building.
-Her father pays all that tuition

18:01.830 --> 18:04.666
so his daughter can study
advanced lice infestation

18:04.750 --> 18:06.043
with some skelly street dealer.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.878
Hey, look, it'd be ten minutes
at the most,

18:07.961 --> 18:10.380
and there'd be 50 dollars in it
for you for the inconvenience.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.592
Perhaps they'll use that to buy
a new hanging plant or two.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.637
Uh... Look, how would, uh,
the late afternoon be today?

18:16.762 --> 18:19.098
Oh, that... that may impose on her
and the boyfriend's time

18:19.181 --> 18:21.558
-for deep coma behind the drugs they take.
-Okay. (COUGHS)

18:21.683 --> 18:23.769
All right, thank you so much
for your cooperation.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.896
Yeah, that would be in cash.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.981
-(CAR HORN HONKING)
-Bye-bye.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.237
I hope you're getting bridgework for life.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.824
(DEEPLY INHALES)

18:42.162 --> 18:43.163
Andy.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.250
Okay, here we go, guys, here we go.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.757
Police! Don't move that car!

18:55.134 --> 18:59.263
-Get out here. (GRUNTS)
-(KENNY GRUNTING)

18:59.972 --> 19:02.599
-Drop the knife! I'm cut, Andy.
-ANDY: You dirty bastard,

19:02.683 --> 19:04.059
-you gonna cut my partner?
-(KENNY GROANING)

19:04.143 --> 19:06.562
-You gonna cut my partner?
-BOBBY: Uh... Guys...

19:06.687 --> 19:08.814
ANDY: Shut your mouth before I split
your head wide open.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.440
-JAMES: You all right, Bobby?
-Yeah.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.401
I... I don't think he got an artery.
Here, take this.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.361
-GREG: James, we got him.
-ANDY: You got him?

19:14.444 --> 19:16.905
-GREG: Yeah. Go take care of Bobby.
-JAMES: Get him to the hospital.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.241
-(DEEPLY BREATHES)
-You all right?

19:19.324 --> 19:22.536
-He cut me pretty good there, Andy.
-You dirty son of a bitch!

19:22.703 --> 19:24.746
Come on, let's get you
stitched up at the hospital.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.039
-BOOBY: Yeah.
-You light-headed?

19:26.123 --> 19:27.624
-BOBBY: No, no.
-ANDY: Good, good.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.960
(BOBBY GROANING, BREATHING DEEPLY)

19:40.804 --> 19:42.014
I'm so tired.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.100
Tell the truth,
and they'll let you go home with me.

19:45.434 --> 19:49.271
I'm telling the truth. A Black man
drugged me, and that's all I remember.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.023
Drugged and raped you?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.483
He tried to rape me, but I fought him off.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.152
Tell you what I think this is.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.237
I think you got a boyfriend
you ain't telling me about.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.073
-No.
-These detectives, they believe that, too.

20:00.157 --> 20:04.161
-You want to go to jail over lying?
-No one's going to jail, Mrs. Nuñez.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.205
You'll wish you was in jail
when I'm done with you.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.664
(INHALES)

20:08.957 --> 20:10.209
Let me tell it to them.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.340
All right, tell it to them first.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.762
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:23.555 --> 20:25.474
(SNIFFLES) I can't tell her.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.851
Can't tell her what, Nina?

20:28.769 --> 20:30.854
(INHALES) Who it was did this.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.612
It's her boyfriend...

20:39.988 --> 20:42.241
-my mother's.
-Okay.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.493
NINA: It didn't just start, either.

20:45.202 --> 20:49.039
He's weird with me since I grew,
looks at me wrong.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.294
I had a birthday last month,
and he gave me a secret pink nightgown.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.921
Secret from your mom?

20:58.548 --> 21:00.342
I took it, but I never wore it.

21:00.884 --> 21:05.013
(SNIFFLES) But last night, when my mom
was at work, Tony came over with his key.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.142
He was drunk, kept asking me to put it on.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.104
I told him all I wanted
was for him to be nice to my mom.

21:12.896 --> 21:16.191
And then, he said for me to just take
a ride with him in the car...

21:16.650 --> 21:21.196
and that would satisfy him.
So, I agreed to that much.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.991
What happened when you took
the ride with him?

21:25.909 --> 21:27.327
Turned out, he had a... a cloth

21:27.411 --> 21:30.455
and something that made me pass out
when he put it over my face.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.376
(SOBS) And then he woke me up,
and he was on top of me.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.629
Said he wanted me awake.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.842
But then I started screaming,
and he let me out of the car.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.679
I was afraid if the doctors did
their tests on me, they...

21:46.054 --> 21:48.682
they would know
it was my mother's boyfriend who did this.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.393
That's why I left the hospital.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.566
-Okay, Nina.
-(SOBS) I can't tell my mom.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.527
We... we've been alone
ever since my dad left.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.574
She was so happy
she finally got a boyfriend.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.993
DIANE: No, we're gonna tell her.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.619
(NINA SOBBING)

22:16.376 --> 22:18.295
-What'd she admit?
-(DIANE SIGHS)

22:18.503 --> 22:20.839
Nina made up the story
about a stranger raping her

22:20.922 --> 22:22.716
because the man who attacked her
was your boyfriend.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.344
-What are you saying to me?
-Your boyfriend Tony

22:25.427 --> 22:28.221
came to your apartment last night
while you were at work.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.557
He's been makin' advances
at Nina for quite a while.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.017
Off her leading him on?

22:32.351 --> 22:36.146
He had to use something like chloroform
to knock Nina unconscious.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.315
We need to know where to find Tony.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.360
You don't worry about that.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.820
I know where to look for Tony,
and I know what to do.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.406
Mrs. Nuñez, maybe you need
to start thinkin' about your daughter

22:46.490 --> 22:49.326
-as much as she's thinkin' about you.
-You take care of Nina.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.328
Leave Tony to us.

22:54.456 --> 22:57.918
All right... (BREATHES DEEPLY)

22:58.043 --> 23:01.213
-...I'll tell you where you can find him.
-Write it down for us.

23:06.176 --> 23:09.221
And, uh, can I take her home now?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.306
You can take her home.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.812
(EXHALES)

23:35.664 --> 23:38.375
(INDISTINCT YELLING)

23:38.458 --> 23:40.502
Kenny was a nice chatterbox.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.337
Yeah, huh?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.215
-Somebody cut the cheese?
-Come on.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.635
I'm fighting for my life here!

23:48.718 --> 23:50.220
ANDY: All right, just shut up
in there, Kenny.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.514
We're gonna do the talking,
you're gonna do the listening,

23:52.722 --> 23:57.227
-then it'll be your turn to talk.
-I... I got a lot of people after me, yo.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.148
I thought you was those people.
I was defending myself!

24:01.481 --> 24:03.275
I'm very sorry that I cut you.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.235
You just give me some
straight answers, Kenny.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.237
I'll know that your apology is sincere.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.989
Pullin' that knife on me
was just a mistake.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.741
-Let it go.
-Your voice is on an answering machine

24:11.867 --> 24:15.328
in an apartment an unfortunate occurrence
took place in, Kenny.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.330
-What apartment?
-Kevin Radnor's.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.041
Mr. Radnor was my former
high school teacher.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.335
-ANDY: Uh-huh.
-How long you been out of high school?

24:22.461 --> 24:26.089
Two years.
But me and Mr. Radnor kept in touch.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.384
What kind of unfortunate occurrence
occurred?

24:29.843 --> 24:32.345
-Kevin Radnor was murdered.
-Oh, no.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.847
-(SCOFFS)
-Oh, no!

24:33.930 --> 24:35.557
-Yeah. "Oh, no."
-No, no, see,

24:35.640 --> 24:39.394
I didn't realize you wanted to talk to me
because I was on that answering machine.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.105
-Well, that was it.
-Well, there's a natural explanation

24:42.189 --> 24:45.942
for me bein' on that.
From Mr. Radnor continuing our friendship.

24:46.067 --> 24:49.362
-BOBBY: Well, tell us about that, Kenny.
-KENNY: Well, he was trying

24:49.488 --> 24:51.281
to get me on track to a better life,

24:51.448 --> 24:53.617
-'cause that's what I'm all about.
-Obviously.

24:54.117 --> 24:58.038
See, a... a while back, he even arranged

Shut up, Kenny. Talk to your friend.

Never met a single Kenny.

Kenny, who you took off
that apartment with,

28:31.626 --> 28:34.921
who stole the ATM card
that you were caught using on that camera.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.549
I was never up there.
I found that ATM card.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.217
Oh, you know
that's an obvious damn lie, Dino,

28:39.300 --> 28:41.177
because you need to know
the pin number to use the card.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.806
You found out the pin number
from the guy in that apartment, Dino.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.517

28:47.642 --> 28:51.229

when he came in the grocery to steal.

I... I be lookout for him

but Kenny's teacher wouldn't listen.

He wouldn't call his father for nothin'.

and pulled out a knife,

And I say, "Kenny, let's go.
We already got his ATM card,"

29:45.116 --> 29:47.869
But Kenny wouldn't have it.
He start stabbin' him.

And even how much the teacher
was gettin' cut,

29:50.955 --> 29:52.582
he's... he wouldn't call the old man,

wasn't successful anyway.

over me any way he wanted to.

you and Mr. Radnor weren't involved?

<i>You know, the... the rich hotel guy?</i>

34:22.685 --> 34:25.521
Yeah, so, I personally contacted
Mr. Radnor's father

34:25.605 --> 34:28.733
when Mr. Radnor declined
asking his father to help me

34:28.816 --> 34:30.818
with my success curve.

He asked were we gay together
and I better not go to the media.

34:34.906 --> 34:38.576
I guess he figured. Why else would
Mr. Radnor want to teach high school

34:38.910 --> 34:40.953
when he could be livin'
in the penthouse floor

34:41.037 --> 34:43.122

<i>So, then it was the father</i>
<i>who brought up the whole gay idea.</i>

34:46.959 --> 34:49.462
Well, queer is what Mr. Radnor's father
wanted to hear,

34:49.545 --> 34:53.049
and queer is what I gave him.
But keep in mind, though,

all right, I started four games
at halfback my senior year.

I'm in there, and I'm downfield, yo!

to make the call

37:13.189 --> 37:15.483
You seem like your...
your energy's depleted.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.859
I feel like I got a chest cold.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.569
Well, maybe you should
take a few sick days.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.697
-(CHUCKLES) It's a cold, Andy.
-(GARGLES)

37:23.157 --> 37:25.201
This may surprise ya. (SNIFFLES)

37:25.326 --> 37:28.788
People gettin' colds is how
that whole sick day concept developed.

37:29.705 --> 37:32.041
Yeah, well, the doctor,
he said the antibiotics for my arm

37:32.124 --> 37:34.043
would probably clear up the chest too.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.589
-Where you goin' now?
-I gotta go see that dentist's daughter.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.800
No, you should go home,
you should get some rest.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.385
Tomorrow you should take the day off,

37:42.468 --> 37:43.928
'cause I don't like
this whole energy level

37:44.011 --> 37:45.638
-goin' on like a week now...
-Andy...

37:45.721 --> 37:47.765
You want me to go
to this apartment with you?

37:47.890 --> 37:50.101
You cruisin' for some free bridgework?

37:51.477 --> 37:53.813
What time frame the doc give you
for feelin' better?

37:54.605 --> 37:56.190
Tomorrow morning.

37:58.901 --> 37:59.902
See ya.

38:00.903 --> 38:01.904
-Yeah.
-(DOOR CLOSING)

38:11.706 --> 38:14.208
-You from the buyers' association?
-Yeah. How's it goin'?

38:14.333 --> 38:17.253
Yeah, um, yeah, you mentioned 50 bucks.

38:17.336 --> 38:20.256
Will I be inconveniencing anyone
if I look around here a little?

38:20.339 --> 38:22.633
Hey, uh, excuse me, I need that 50 dollars

38:22.800 --> 38:25.970
-before I let you inconvenience us.
-Hey, get on your feet. I'm a cop.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.430
-DAN: What's goin' on?
-Get on your feet...

38:27.555 --> 38:29.557
-REECE: What is this?
-...and I will tell you what's goin' on.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.808
Pick up your kit.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.478
He's a cop, Reece.
I told you it was a set-up.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.106
REECE: No, you said it might be
Joaquín lookin' to get you for payback.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.983
-DAN: (SHUSHING) Shut up.
-BOBBY: What you got here?

38:39.066 --> 38:41.902
That, uh, that's strictly for protection
in case of burglaries.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.362
Yeah, I bet it's registered, too, right?

38:43.446 --> 38:45.448
Both of you,
get in the next room and sit down.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.533
-Get in here.
-This is all illegal anyway,

38:47.616 --> 38:49.994
because you came in under false pretenses.

38:50.119 --> 38:53.039
Oh, that sounds
like a college idea, Reece.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.582
You drop out of college?

38:55.624 --> 38:56.625
Look at this mess.

38:58.794 --> 38:59.962
He's from my dad.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.590
No, the real reason I'm here...

39:03.966 --> 39:05.217
is out of friendship...

39:06.719 --> 39:08.554
with the other tenants in this building

39:08.804 --> 39:11.015
that are concerned
about the amount and type of traffic

39:11.098 --> 39:12.600
comin' in and out of this apartment.

39:12.725 --> 39:15.269
-That'll be your friend, Mrs. Sampson.
-BOBBY: What's your name?

39:15.770 --> 39:17.980
-Dan Evers.
-You're done talkin', okay, Dan?

39:18.147 --> 39:19.899
I was just sayin',
'cause she feeds the lady's cat.

39:19.982 --> 39:20.983
Okay, Dan?

39:21.400 --> 39:24.028
Now, I know if I make you empty out
your right front pocket there,

39:24.111 --> 39:25.571
you're gonna come up wrong for dope.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.824
I'm not gonna make you do that.
I'm not lookin' to arrest anyone here.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.786
-What'd you come lookin' to do?
-Restore this apartment,

39:32.286 --> 39:35.164
so that it's not deteriorating
this building's quality of life.

39:35.289 --> 39:39.210
And it's your bad luck, Dan,
that I've got your works, and your 25.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.420
But... but you didn't come lookin'
to arrest anybody, right?

39:41.545 --> 39:44.382
-Well, I can't overlook those. I'm sorry.
-Oh, okay, look,

39:44.507 --> 39:46.884
you came here to restore
the quality of life?

39:47.009 --> 39:49.011
-So, what are you saying?
-(HANDCUFFS CLATTERING)

39:49.178 --> 39:51.555
If you don't arrest me, I'll leave.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.474
BOBBY: Sounds like a plan.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.560
I'm holding on to your works,
I'm holding on to your weapon,

39:56.644 --> 39:59.105
and I'm filing a full report
in DD5 abeyance.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.733
First, I hear that you're back,
I'm back to lock your ass up.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.403
-Ten minutes to get outta here.
-No problem, no problem.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.656
I mean, uh, it's probably better
for you like this anyway.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.908
Yeah, you've been better
for me right along.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.619
You get me hooked,
and now I gotta cop on my own.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.226
-(BOBBY CLEARING THROAT)
-He appears.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.854
-In the flesh.
-(DIANE CHUCKLING)

40:40.980 --> 40:42.648
-In the flesh.
-DIANE: Hmm.

40:43.983 --> 40:47.027
-Does your arm hurt?
-BOBBY: Uh... No, it's...

40:47.778 --> 40:50.739
it's okay.
Doc gave me an antibiotic for it.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.783
How'd it go with the dentist's daughter?

40:53.242 --> 40:56.912
(SIGHS) You know,
I did my act with this boyfriend.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.707
I gotta call that Dr. Reissman.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.917
I mean, if he wants to get
his daughter straight,

41:02.001 --> 41:03.627
he better get her ass in a program.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.379
Now, see?

41:06.881 --> 41:11.427
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

41:12.636 --> 41:16.974
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Damn.
I wish I knew why I can't breathe.

41:18.934 --> 41:22.021
-Come sit down.
-Nah. Let me just get some fresh air.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.734
-This is gettin' ridiculous.
-(WINDOW OPENING)

41:28.652 --> 41:30.946
-Are you light-headed, Bobby?
-Mm-mm.

41:33.574 --> 41:39.538
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

41:41.040 --> 41:42.833
This antibiotic will clear it up.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.003
The doctor said
it'll clear my chest up too.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.172
(SIGHS)
You know, you should rest tomorrow.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.840
Probably half of it's just being run-down.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.635
No, he said the antibiotic clears
everything up, but hangovers.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.263
-(SIGHS)
-If you don't feel better,

41:56.347 --> 41:57.681
I'm keeping you home.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.184
(SNIFFLES)

42:04.396 --> 42:05.648
(SNIFFLES)

42:06.732 --> 42:09.360
What are you gonna do, uh,
make me some hot cocoa?

42:09.568 --> 42:12.947
-I happen to make killer cocoa.
-BOBBY: Yeah, I bet you do.

42:16.825 --> 42:17.826
(SNIFFLING)

42:20.579 --> 42:27.086
(WHEEZES)

42:34.969 --> 42:35.970
(EXHALES)

42:37.054 --> 42:38.055
I'm okay.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.600
-I know.
-(EXHALES)

42:42.726 --> 42:46.355
-(BREATHES HEAVILY)
-(SIGHS)

42:47.648 --> 42:48.899
How okay are you?

42:51.026 --> 42:54.029
Well, you better stand back
once this medicine kicks in.

42:54.863 --> 42:57.199
(CHUCKLES) I'm not goin' anywhere.
