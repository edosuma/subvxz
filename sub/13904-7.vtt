WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.085
I have slept with 1,036 men.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.680
Why would you want to see me
when there's all that baggage?

00:05.715 --> 00:09.000
Because I don't see
baggage. Or a problem.

00:09.035 --> 00:10.800
So, we're on? Yeah, we're on.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.320
I'm taking her to the opera.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.560
Right.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.000
Evening, evening. Everyone
having a good time?

00:20.035 --> 00:22.240
Look, mate, why don't
you sit somewhere else?

00:22.275 --> 00:24.417
Listen, mate. Duncan is a prick.

00:24.452 --> 00:26.525
I'm sorry if your night was spoilt.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.920
I give up on you. I've
had enough. I just give up!

01:12.720 --> 01:15.160
I've spent all this time
writing about clients.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.000
But I don't know what it's
like to BE a client so...

01:25.280 --> 01:27.200
This is just research.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.200
Duncan approves of
research. So... not cheating.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.600
Is it?

01:41.520 --> 01:43.360
- Nice place.
- Thanks.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.480
Sorry if I seemed a little bit
um... well, thrown just then.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.360
Shit. Sorry, have I got the
wrong time? I'm such a-

01:52.395 --> 01:54.397
Oh, no, no... not at all.
You're bang on time.

01:54.432 --> 01:56.400
You're just not... er...
How can I put this?

01:56.435 --> 01:58.280
...like my usual clients.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.565
In a good way.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.960
Sorry. What I'm trying to say is that...

02:04.400 --> 02:08.120
...most of the women I see
tend to be more... mature.

02:10.039 --> 02:16.159
Yes. Right, well, I'm
actually older than I look.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.120
Surgery.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.280
So...

02:24.000 --> 02:25.920
So...

02:28.800 --> 02:30.680
Oh, right.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.280
Here you go, it's all there.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.165
Thank you.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.600
So you said in your email
you've never done this before?

02:38.635 --> 02:40.720
Yes. Sorry. I'm a bit nervous.

02:40.755 --> 02:42.525
- Don't be.
- Oh! Ha...

02:42.560 --> 02:44.480
I'm really glad you chose me.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.960
I suppose, in a roundabout
way, what I'm trying to say is

02:49.800 --> 02:51.680
I think you're really beautiful.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.000
I'm going to jump in the shower.
Do you want to come through?

02:58.035 --> 02:59.880
Sure. OK.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.240
Great.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.680
Great.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.245
'I'll take your lead'. Please!

03:09.280 --> 03:11.880
If the blue on his lips
is anything to go by,

03:11.915 --> 03:13.800
it's the Viagra that's leading him.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.120
Do you want to join me?

03:19.155 --> 03:20.880
No. I'm OK. You go ahead.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.280
If you're sure.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.100
So... how long have you
being doing this, Connor?

03:39.135 --> 03:41.680
I did it a bit when I was
at uni to clear some debts

03:41.715 --> 03:43.800
and I really enjoyed
it. So I carried on...

03:44.240 --> 03:48.120
A female escort reveals
her body bit by bit.

03:48.155 --> 03:50.885
It's the ancient art of seduction.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.085
.. and it kind of fits in
with my web design work,

03:53.120 --> 03:56.360
- I can do both jobs from home.
- Something he could do with learning.

03:56.395 --> 03:58.320
So... that's why your website's so good?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.080
- Yeah.
- Right.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.080
Can you dry my back?

04:09.840 --> 04:12.760
Sorry. I don't want to get
you wet. Well, not yet, anyway.

04:12.795 --> 04:16.005
Was that cheesy? Oh,
that was really cheesy.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.640
- Yeah, it was a bit.
- Don't hold it against me will you?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.840
There you go. All done.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.560
Shall we go through?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.620
Come here.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.825
I don't...

04:55.860 --> 04:57.780
I'm not sure what this is.

04:57.815 --> 04:59.700
It seems to be in the way.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.100
Do you want me to take it off?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.060
I hadn't thought of that, but yes.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.345
What the hell are these?

05:17.380 --> 05:20.940
I don't know, but I should probably
take them off, don't you think?

05:20.975 --> 05:22.740
- Let's try it.
- OK.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.300
Is there anything you'd like me to do?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.420
Oh. Um...

05:40.540 --> 05:42.460
I don't really know.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.500
Maybe I should ask him
to re-design my website.

05:54.940 --> 05:59.260
Concentrate. Um... Nice...
These are nice sheets.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.665
He could really do
with some dimmer lights.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.100
How does he get a girl in
the mood for... Oh, my God!

06:06.420 --> 06:08.540
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's fine. Just...

06:08.575 --> 06:10.420
Just carry on.

06:11.740 --> 06:16.700
Just research. You know,
nothing to feel guilty about...

06:16.735 --> 06:19.060
OK, Connor, Connor, Connor.
I can't do this.

06:19.095 --> 06:21.185
Um...

06:21.220 --> 06:24.740
I um... I have a boyfriend.
This just feels really unfaithful.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.920
OK. Well, I wouldn't beat yourself up.

06:28.955 --> 06:31.460
- I see lots of married women.
- Really?

06:31.900 --> 06:34.740
They come here because they
don't want to have an affair.

06:34.775 --> 06:36.500
I think it shows you really care.

06:36.535 --> 06:38.380
Yeah?

06:39.860 --> 06:41.940
I really wouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

06:42.940 --> 06:44.820
OK, right, now I just feel even worse.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.100
- Oh, shit. What did I say?
- Nothing. It's...

06:48.135 --> 06:50.020
You are lovely. It's just...

06:51.220 --> 06:53.140
Look, look... I'm an escort too.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.940
What?

06:56.420 --> 06:59.180
And... I'm writing this book.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.580
And um... this, with you, was
going to be the next chapter.

07:03.615 --> 07:05.505
- What kind of book?
- It's er...

07:05.540 --> 07:07.665
It's a book about my life as an escort.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.650
- It's coming out in the spring.
- Whoa. That is out of order.

07:10.685 --> 07:13.600
Yes. I know but you were going
to be completely anonymous,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.540
no-one would ever have to know.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.705
It's still pretty sneaky.

07:17.740 --> 07:21.860
I know. But um... if it's any
consolation, you're really good.

07:22.940 --> 07:26.020
You can't put that bit in when I
said 'I don't want to get you wet',

07:26.055 --> 07:27.780
- I never normally say that!
- I won't.

07:28.020 --> 07:31.425
I wouldn't. Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

07:31.460 --> 07:33.820
This was a really bad idea.
I should probably just go.

07:33.855 --> 07:35.865
Hang on. You can't just go.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.980
- No, no, I think I should.
- No, it's not fair.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.180
If I'm going to be in a book, at
least let me show you what I can do.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.560
I've barely got started.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.200
How about a little bit
of professional courtesy?

07:51.280 --> 07:53.160
Can I just have a minute?

07:59.840 --> 08:02.200
Duncan's having a
relationship with Hannah.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.200
If I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do it as Belle.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.080
Show me what you've got.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.120
Too much?

08:25.760 --> 08:28.485
Well, he is a new client, you
don't want to scare him off.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.640
Yeah. Stephanie says when he likes a girl
he's loyal so I've got to get this right.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.200
OK, I'm off.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.240
Oh, Bam-Bam!

08:42.559 --> 08:44.440
Lube.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.245
Thanks, babe.
Don't pick anything stupid.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.960
I want everyone to be looking
at me on my wedding day.

08:50.995 --> 08:52.840
Of course!

09:06.720 --> 09:09.520
- Well done.
- Pleasure. Enough material?

09:09.555 --> 09:11.365
There's plenty.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.280
Well, tell me it was good, for fuck's
sake, I'll have a nervous breakdown.

09:14.315 --> 09:16.160
It was adequate.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.280
Ah! It was great and you know it.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.800
Yes!

09:54.440 --> 09:56.400
Hi Richard.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.940
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing?

10:22.460 --> 10:24.460
Just... catching up with some people.

10:25.620 --> 10:29.740
- How's your day been?
- Yeah, it was good. It was good.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.060
Good, good. I'm glad.

10:32.740 --> 10:37.300
Well, actually it was a bit weird.
But... you're busy. So. I won't...

10:38.220 --> 10:40.100
Yeah. I probably should go actually.

10:40.460 --> 10:43.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Sorry. Get back to your thing.

10:43.495 --> 10:45.380
OK. I love you.

10:48.260 --> 10:50.300
Oh, my God.
I didn't just say that, did I?

10:50.700 --> 10:52.620
Did I say that? I said that.

10:56.060 --> 10:57.980
Everything all right?

10:58.140 --> 11:00.100
Yeah.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.420
Um...

11:07.580 --> 11:09.220
Here's a little extra for you.

11:09.255 --> 11:11.140
Thank you, Richard.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.100
- Bambi.
- Yes?

11:16.620 --> 11:20.060
I'd like to see you again.
Would you like to see me again?

11:20.900 --> 11:24.460
I'd love to. Call Stephanie
and I'll clear my diary.

11:24.495 --> 11:26.220
- Good. I'll look forward to it.
- Me too.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.985
This will be fine.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.080
I've done the hard part.

11:51.115 --> 11:53.140
This is just typing it up.

11:53.175 --> 11:54.980
Like I always do.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.100
Duncan'll be fine about it.

11:57.260 --> 11:59.140
Won't he?

12:00.340 --> 12:02.180
Oh, fuck.

12:08.140 --> 12:10.305
Han. I'm sorry for the last message

12:10.340 --> 12:12.980
and I'm sorry I was drunk
and rude to Duncan. Call me.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.580
'You have ten new messages. '

12:16.860 --> 12:19.025
Han. I was a dick. I know that.

12:19.060 --> 12:22.340
But you're being a dick now not
returning my calls. Ring me back.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.540
- 'Next new message. '
- Dick.

12:24.740 --> 12:26.620
'Next new message. '

12:27.220 --> 12:30.020
Come on, Hannah. I hate
this. For fuck's sakes, pick-

12:38.900 --> 12:40.820
Here we go.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.060
Nothing Duncan hasn't seen before.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.340
I paid for sex. So what?

13:04.860 --> 13:06.785
All right!

13:06.820 --> 13:09.780
'Connor was the most
extraordinary lover I've ever had'.

13:10.820 --> 13:12.740
Maybe I should lie.

13:14.220 --> 13:17.460
'Connor was very disappointing
in the trouser department. '

13:18.300 --> 13:19.505
Fuck!

13:19.540 --> 13:21.940
'He didn't know anything
about a woman's body'.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.740
'He really didn't have
a clue what to do'.

13:28.860 --> 13:30.660
'I couldn't wait for it to be over. '

13:30.695 --> 13:32.420
- Oh!
- Oh... Oh...

13:33.460 --> 13:35.065
Oh...

13:35.100 --> 13:37.265
I've got to be honest.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.020
If we're going to work, as a
couple, he's got to know the truth.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.740
OK.

13:45.540 --> 13:49.500
'In one hour, Connor taught me more
about my body than a lifetime of clients.

13:51.740 --> 13:56.820
A male escort needs charm, patience,
stamina and a sizable asset... '

14:01.340 --> 14:04.060
- I know, meeting ran late.
- Three messages.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.660
Hi, Duncan. New chapter attached. Enjoy!

14:20.900 --> 14:23.820
Han. I've forgiven
you for so much worse.

14:24.620 --> 14:27.700
Can you stop acting like a
child, please and give me a break?

14:28.060 --> 14:30.860
Hi, Maria? Is Duncan in?

14:32.580 --> 14:35.740
No, no. I was just checking he
was in. Is he picking up emails?

14:40.300 --> 14:43.820
No, no, it's fine I don't need to
speak to him. It's fine. OK, thanks.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.820
I'm not going to ring him.
I'm just going to play it cool.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.980
Hi! It's me.

14:55.220 --> 14:56.905
Hi.

14:56.940 --> 14:58.820
Did you get the new chapter?

14:58.855 --> 15:00.700
I'm just reading it now.

15:01.940 --> 15:03.820
What do you think?

15:03.855 --> 15:05.700
It's very interesting.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.140
Should we talk? Why
don't you come round?

15:10.175 --> 15:12.460
- Yeah. I think I should.
- OK.

15:16.900 --> 15:20.300
I'm going out to see a writer.
Anything urgent, I'm on my mobile.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.300
Ben!

15:32.100 --> 15:33.980
Hello, mate.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.940
I'm sorry about the other night.
I was a bit hammered.

15:37.975 --> 15:40.020
I don't really remember
what happened but...

15:40.055 --> 15:42.260
Hannah said I was a dick.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.425
No, it's fine.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.340
Actually, I think it's great.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.425
What is?

15:48.460 --> 15:51.620
I wish I could be reckless and act
like a prick every now and again,

15:51.655 --> 15:53.945
but running a company, I can't.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.180
I guess that's one of the
perks of being a barman.

15:56.215 --> 15:58.220
No-one really cares
what you do, do they?

15:58.580 --> 16:01.020
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You coming up?

16:01.460 --> 16:04.340
No. You go ahead. I've got
somewhere else I've got to be.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.020
Hi.

16:21.820 --> 16:23.660
So, what did you think?

16:23.695 --> 16:25.505
Yeah. Er...

16:25.540 --> 16:27.460
The chapter was good.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.425
Really?

16:30.460 --> 16:32.380
What did you really think?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.420
It was a bit weird.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.705
Unsettling. It felt weird.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.620
I really didn't want to send it.

16:41.660 --> 16:44.340
Why is this different
to all the clients?

16:44.375 --> 16:47.020
I know. It shouldn't
be. But it is, isn't it?

16:47.660 --> 16:48.865
Yeah.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.140
Maybe I should have
asked you before I did it.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.905
I would have told you to do it

16:53.940 --> 16:56.740
and then spent the rest
of the day kicking myself.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.060
I really freaked out
when I was with him.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.585
- Really?
- Really.

17:04.619 --> 17:07.300
- What are we like?
- I don't know.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.640
Did he have a good body?

17:14.675 --> 17:16.540
Not a patch on yours.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.579
- Whose girl are you?
- Yours.

17:19.940 --> 17:21.780
- Sure?
- Sure.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.700
Not that other guy's?

17:31.060 --> 17:32.980
Let's go to bed.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.420
Let's stay here.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.260
I love touching you.

17:56.620 --> 17:58.340
Is it like how he touched you?

17:58.375 --> 18:00.260
Yeah.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.220
I want to fuck you.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.020
Did you like it when he pinned you down?

18:13.055 --> 18:14.860
Stop talking about him!

18:17.540 --> 18:20.300
- Suck me.
- No, no, no, I want to stop.

18:20.335 --> 18:21.785
What?

18:21.820 --> 18:24.140
Just... stop for a minute.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.220
Why?

18:31.220 --> 18:33.980
I think we're just
confusing things a bit.

18:36.140 --> 18:38.060
What do you mean?

18:40.860 --> 18:43.500
I think you want to be
having sex with Belle, not me.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.660
God, I'm sorry.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.300
I didn't mean to make you feel...

18:53.860 --> 18:56.425
This whole thing is just
messing with my head.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.705
- It's OK. Just forget about it.
- I'm really sorry.

18:58.740 --> 19:01.700
It's OK. It's just a fucked-up
day. Let's just write it off.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.460
You know that thing you said earlier?

19:15.980 --> 19:17.980
No. What?

19:18.015 --> 19:19.980
You know.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.980
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:25.015 --> 19:26.860
About loving me.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.865
That was just...

19:29.900 --> 19:31.820
That was just something I...

19:33.220 --> 19:35.180
I love you too.

19:52.155 --> 19:53.860
Just ignore it.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.305
Could it be a client?

20:02.935 --> 20:04.780
Oh, God!

20:08.020 --> 20:09.225
Hello.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.180
I really want you to see my dress.

20:11.980 --> 20:15.340
Babe, it's really not a good time.
You've got to see it, it's amazing.

20:15.375 --> 20:17.617
Duncan's here and we're kind
of in the middle of things.

20:17.652 --> 20:19.860
I can invite him to the wedding.
Come on, buzz me in!

20:19.861 --> 20:21.861
OK, OK.

20:22.380 --> 20:25.460
It's a work friend. She's a bit
mad but she's actually quite sweet.

20:25.495 --> 20:27.625
Is it Letitia?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.580
It is, it's the real-life
Letitia, isn't it?

20:29.615 --> 20:31.420
Well, I couldn't possibly say.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.340
- Hey!
- Thanks, babes.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.700
Bambi, this is Dunky. Duncan.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.745
This is Duncan. He's my
boyfriend. Duncan, this is Bambi.

20:43.780 --> 20:46.980
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said
that. I think I had a small fit!

20:50.340 --> 20:52.260
I'll just put this round here, shall I?

20:56.820 --> 20:58.700
So... when's the big day?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.220
28th.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.420
Bambi, why don't you... hm?

21:08.260 --> 21:10.140
Oh, yes.

21:11.020 --> 21:15.300
Duncan, would you like
to come to my wedding?

21:21.800 --> 21:23.700
Of course, I'd love to.

21:57.701 --> 22:01.201
