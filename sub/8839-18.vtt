OF THE PATIENCE YOU
SHOW TO YOUR STUDENTS.

WHERE WOULD
I BE NOW WITHOUT IT?

THE PROBLEM IS, YOU THINK
EVERY FATHER IN THE WORLD

I KNOW,
BUT SHE HAD
ANOTHER ONE. LUCY.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.705
BUT MAMA COULDN'T
KEEP BOTH OF US.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.373
THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.043
I'M SURE YOUR MOTHER
DID WHAT SHE THOUGHT
WAS BEST FOR YOU.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.378
NOT MY MAMA.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.963
SHE ONLY
HAD TIME FOR ONE.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.382
THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE
WITH MISS TERHUNE.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.343
SHE JUST LEFT ME
AND WENT AWAY
WITH MY SISTER.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.179
NEVER CAME BACK.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.265

FOR ONE BABY.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.892
YOU'LL SEE.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.896
I'VE GOT A SCHOOL
FULL OF CHILDREN.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.731
ONE MORE WON'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.566
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.361
I'LL GET ALONG.
ALWAYS HAVE.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.948
ELI, YOU KNOW YOU'RE
SPECIAL TO ME.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.784
NOTHING WILL
CHANGE.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.202
YOU PROMISE?

13:07.369 --> 13:10.288
I PROMISE.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.836
WHOA! WHOA!

13:32.561 --> 13:33.770
HELLO, ADAM.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.647
Adam:
HELLO, FATHER.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.984
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
MY WIFE, MARY.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.362
HELLO, MARY.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.822
IT'S A PLEASURE,
SIR.

13:43.989 --> 13:47.283
WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE
FORMAL FOR MY DAUGHTER.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.869
IT'S A PLEASURE,
FATHER.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.913
THAT'S MORE
LIKE IT.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.292
WELL, ADAM...

13:56.460 --> 13:59.254
IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.590
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG,
FATHER.

14:16.522 --> 14:21.609
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
SPECIAL FROM NEW YORK.
BORDEAUX CLARET, 1865.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.444
Carrie: THAT'S
OLDER THAN ME.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.780
DIDN'T THEY HAVE
ANY NEW ONES?

14:25.948 --> 14:26.906
[LAUGHS]

14:27.074 --> 14:29.450
WELL, WINE IMPROVES
WITH AGE, MY DEAR.

14:29.618 --> 14:32.996
I'LL JUST TAKE
THE CORK OFF, AND...

14:33.163 --> 14:37.166
WE'LL LET IT BREATHE
FOR A WHILE.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.836
CHARLES?

14:40.004 --> 14:42.338
THANK YOU.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.048
THAT'S A NICE CORK,
WHAT DO I DO WITH IT?

14:44.216 --> 14:46.718
YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO SNIFF IT,
MR. INGALLS.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.845
OH.

14:49.013 --> 14:49.846
IT SMELLS
LIKE WINE.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.264
WELL, THAT'S
PERFECT,

14:51.432 --> 14:53.391
BECAUSE IF IT SMELLED
LIKE A CORK,
THAT WOULD MEAN

14:53.559 --> 14:56.769
THAT AIR GOT INTO
THE BOTTLE, AND PROBABLY
SPOILED THE WINE.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.271
Charles: I'LL BE DARNED,
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.606
Mr. Kendall: YEAH.
[LAUGHS]

14:59.773 --> 15:02.025
WAIT TILL
NELLIE OLESON
HEARS ABOUT THIS.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.777
SHE THINKS SHE'S
SO SOPHISTICATED.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.363
I BET MISS ELLIOTT
KNOWS ALL ABOUT WINE.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.198
SHE'S A REAL LADY.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.825
MR. KENDALL?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.285
Mr. Kendall: HMM?

15:12.453 --> 15:15.538
IT'S NOT BREATHING.
I THINK IT'S DEAD.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.291
[LAUGHTER]

15:37.978 --> 15:39.604
HEY.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.190
COME HERE,
PREGNANT LADY.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.233
YOU KNOW,
MY FATHER TELLS ME

15:44.401 --> 15:45.944
I MARRIED A BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG WOMAN.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.279
I KNEW I'D LIKE
YOUR FATHER.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.031
[LAUGHS]

15:50.199 --> 15:53.159
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
FELT HAPPY TONIGHT,

15:53.327 --> 15:55.453
AND I'M GLAD
YOU WROTE TO HIM.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.621
I'M GLAD, TOO.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.039
I GUESS IT MEANT
A LOT MORE TO ME

15:58.207 --> 15:59.332
THAN I THOUGHT
IT DID.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.459
YOU'RE ALL HE'S GOT,
YOU KNOW.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.797
FATHER NEVER SEEMED
THE TYPE TO NEED
ANYONE BEFORE,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.091
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,
PEOPLE CHANGE.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.468
AND IF WE DON'T GO
TO BED SOON I'LL TURN
INTO A PUMPKIN.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.596
OH. FROM THE SHAPE
OF YOUR STOMACH
I'D SAY WE'RE TOO LATE.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.931
IT'S ALREADY TURNING.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.016
VERY FUNNY.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.952
- SUSAN GOODSPEED.
- HERE.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.496
- THOMAS MURRAY.
- PRESENT.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.248
BENJAMIN STONE.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.709
Benjamin: HERE, SIR,
MR. KENDALL.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.627
- OH.
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.629
I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYONE WAS THERE.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.465
IT'S ALL
RIGHT, SON.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.134
FATHER.

16:51.301 --> 16:55.263
CLASS, THIS IS
MR. GILES KENDALL,
MY FATHER.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.141
Children: HELLO,
MR. KENDALL.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.642
HELLO.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.145
ACTUALLY, ADAM,
I CAME HERE
TO TALK TO YOU.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.604
IT'S KIND OF
IMPORTANT.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.314
Adam: ALL RIGHT.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.025
MARY, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.609
FINE.

17:19.288 --> 17:23.458
NOW, SON, I'M GOING
TO COME RIGHT
TO THE POINT.

17:23.625 --> 17:27.837
HOW WOULD YOU AND MARY
LIKE TO COME LIVE
WITH ME IN NEW YORK?

17:28.005 --> 17:30.715
- WHAT?
- NOW, HEAR ME OUT.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.176
A COLLEAGUE OF MINE
KNOWS THIS LAWYER

17:33.343 --> 17:35.344
WHO PRACTICES
IN PHILADELPHIA.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.180
NAME OF MAYER.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.182
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT,

17:39.349 --> 17:43.978
BUT THIS MAN,
THIS LAWYER,
IS BLIND.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.273
FATHER,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

17:47.441 --> 17:51.360
THERE'S A VERY,
VERY FINE LAW SCHOOL
IN NEW YORK CITY,

17:51.528 --> 17:54.072
AND YOU'VE GOT
THE BRAINS.

17:54.239 --> 17:59.160
AFTER YOU GRADUATE,
I CAN GUARANTEE
A POSITION IN MY FIRM.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.121
WELL, WHAT
ABOUT THE SCHOOL?

18:02.289 --> 18:03.915
THE...

18:04.083 --> 18:05.041
THE SCHOOL?

18:05.209 --> 18:08.211
WELL, I FIGURE
THAT YOU'LL DO MORE

18:08.378 --> 18:12.673
FOR FOLKS LIKE YOU
IN A COURTROOM
THAN IN A CLASSROOM.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.259
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.596
IT'S...ALL OF A SUDDEN,
A LAWYER.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.224
I CAN'T ANSWER YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.309
WELL,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.063
YOU TALK TO MARY,
AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.276
OH, BOY...
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.571
I OWE THIS
TO YOU, SON.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.241
YOU AND I HAVE,
WELL,

18:38.408 --> 18:42.078
KIND OF GONE
OUR SEPARATE WAYS
THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND...

18:42.246 --> 18:44.747
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
STUDENTS WAITING
FOR YOU.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.376
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T WE ALL HAVE
DINNER TOGETHER TONIGHT?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.419
ALL RIGHT.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.797
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.573
[CHEERING]

19:22.786 --> 19:25.246
OH, HOLLY,
THAT'S VERY NICE.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.790
THANK YOU,
MISS ELLIOTT.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.834
- MISS ELLIOTT?
- YES?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.043
I'M ALL FINISHED.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.504
WHY, NELLIE,
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.174
THANK YOU,
MISS ELLIOTT.

19:36.341 --> 19:40.094
CLASS, I THINK
WE SHOULD ALL
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

19:41.555 --> 19:46.350
NEXT TIME, NELLIE,
TAKE OFF THE PRICE TAG.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.604
WELL, IT SEEMED
KIND OF SILLY
TO MAKE A BASKET

19:49.771 --> 19:52.315
WHEN THERE WAS
A PERFECTLY GOOD ONE
RIGHT THERE IN THE STORE.

19:52.482 --> 19:56.277
I RATHER THINK
YOU MISSED THE POINT
OF THE EXERCISE.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.076
ALBERT, WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO WITH YOU?

20:04.244 --> 20:05.328
YOU DON'T
LIKE IT?

20:05.495 --> 20:06.579
OH, YOUR WORK
IS EXCELLENT,

20:06.747 --> 20:07.914
BUT I'D RATHER
HOPED THE BASKETS

20:08.081 --> 20:10.041
WOULD BE FINISHED
BEFORE I LEFT.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.251
THIS MAY TAKE
ANOTHER MONTH.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.129
WELL, I JUST
WANTED TO MAKE SURE
IT WAS BIG ENOUGH.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.507
WELL, PERHAPS
YOUR SISTER
WILL HAVE TWINS.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.509
AT LEAST I CAN SAY
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A BASKET

20:20.677 --> 20:22.803
TO EQUAL THIS ONE.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.605
[SAW BUZZING]

20:37.486 --> 20:39.070
CHARLES!

20:41.406 --> 20:42.406
CHARLES?

20:42.574 --> 20:44.408
OH, HI!
GILES. SORRY.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.202
I COULDN'T HEAR
A FREIGHT TRAIN
COMING THROUGH HERE

20:46.370 --> 20:47.453
WITH ALL THAT
RACKET GOING ON.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.663
[BUZZING STOPS]

20:48.830 --> 20:50.039
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO INTERRUPT YOU.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.124
NO PROBLEM.
I'M DUE FOR A BREAK,
ANYWAY.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.001
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
TALKING TO ADAM.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.838
I TOLD HIM I'D LIKE
TO PUT HIM IN LAW
SCHOOL IN NEW YORK.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.885
WELL, THAT'S A MIGHTY
GENEROUS OFFER.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.888
WELL, I'M IN A PRETTY
SOUND FINANCIAL
POSITION RIGHT NOW,

21:06.056 --> 21:07.848
I FIGURE THERE'S
MORE PLEASURE

21:08.016 --> 21:10.893
IN PUTTING MONEY
TO GOOD WORK THAN
LETTING IT SIT IDLE.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.520
OF COURSE IT IS.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.731
I IMAGINE IT'S
A PRETTY TOUGH DECISION
FOR ADAM TO MAKE.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.483
IT IS.
IT REALLY IS.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.151
THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

21:19.319 --> 21:23.239
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE ABLE TO PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR ME.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.324
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD
DO THAT, GILES.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.160
I WOULDN'T
WANT TO INTERFERE,
IT'S NOT MY PLACE.

21:28.328 --> 21:29.996
WELL, MARY'S
YOUR DAUGHTER,

21:30.163 --> 21:32.456
AND THAT'S
YOUR GRANDCHILD
SHE'S CARRYING.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.167
YOU KNOW,
CHARLES...

21:35.335 --> 21:37.169
THE CITY
IS THE BEST PLACE

21:37.337 --> 21:39.505
FOR A NEW LIFE
TO BE BORN.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.633
BEST FACILITIES,
BEST MODERN MEDICINE...

21:42.801 --> 21:44.969
WELL, I'VE NEVER
HAD ANY REASON
TO DOUBT DR. BAKER.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.887
WELL, NO.
NO, NO.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.140
BUT I'M ALSO
THINKING
OF THE FUTURE.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.766
JUST IMAGINE
THE OPPORTUNITIES

21:50.934 --> 21:53.436
I'LL BE ABLE TO
PROVIDE THE CHILD.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.272
AND MY PLACE IS BIG
ENOUGH FOR AN ARMY.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.816
I'M SURE IT IS,
GILES,

21:58.984 --> 22:02.820
I JUST FIGURE PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T MEASURE
THEIR HAPPINESS

22:02.988 --> 22:04.989
BY THE SIZE OF THE ROOM
THEY'RE LIVING IN.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.699
OH, IT ISN'T.
IT ISN'T.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.951
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'RE WITH

22:09.119 --> 22:10.536
COUNT FOR
SOMETHING, TOO.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.705
OUR GRANDCHILD
ISN'T GOING TO BE BLIND

22:12.873 --> 22:15.166
LIKE THE OTHER CHILDREN
IN THAT SCHOOL.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.209
MAYBE YOU'RE
FORGETTING ABOUT THAT.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.046
NO, I'M NOT
FORGETTING THAT.

22:20.213 --> 22:23.549
THEN YOU'LL PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR ME?

22:26.887 --> 22:29.096
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T.

22:29.264 --> 22:32.433
WHEN MY CHILDREN
LIVE UNDER MY ROOF,
THEY DO AS I SEE FIT.

22:32.601 --> 22:36.729
WHEN THEY'RE ON
THEIR OWN, THEY MAKE
THEIR OWN DECISIONS.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.523
THAT'S YOUR LAST WORD
ON THE SUBJECT?

22:40.942 --> 22:42.943
I'M AFRAID IT IS,
YES.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.407
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.202
BYE.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.269
Adam:
IT'S THIS WAY, FATHER.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.358
GOOD EVENING,
MARY.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.526
GOOD EVENING,
FATHER.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.320
YOU CERTAINLY SET
AN ATTRACTIVE TABLE.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.155
THANK YOU.
PLEASE,
SIT DOWN.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.407
THANK YOU.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.826
THANK YOU, SON.
THANK YOU.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.870
WELL, SPEAKING
OF ATTRACTIVE TABLES,

23:35.038 --> 23:36.247
WAIT UNTIL
WE GET TO NEW YORK.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.541
THE FINEST
RESTAURANTS
IN THE WORLD.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.126
FATHER...

23:40.293 --> 23:41.877
THERE'S NO HARM
IN BEING OPTIMISTIC.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.838
WE APPRECIATE WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO, BUT--

23:44.005 --> 23:45.339
NO BUTS.
NO BUTS.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.758
IF THIS JOHN F. MAYER
CHARACTER CAN
BECOME A LAWYER,

23:47.926 --> 23:49.218
THEN SO CAN MY SON.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.887
OH, I'M NOT
DOUBTING THAT.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.765
IT'S JUST
THAT MARY AND I
HAVE PUT SO MUCH

23:54.933 --> 23:56.392
OF OURSELVES
INTO THIS SCHOOL.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.563
BELIEVE ME, THINGS
WILL KEEP RIGHT ON
GOING AFTER YOU LEAVE.

24:00.730 --> 24:04.817
I'M SURE THAT BLACK WOMAN
IS CAPABLE OF RUNNING
YOUR SCHOOL.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.528
WELL,
SHE CERTAINLY IS...

24:07.696 --> 24:09.947
AND I KNOW WHAT
AN OPPORTUNITY
THIS IS.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.158
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.785
ADAM...

24:15.912 --> 24:17.580
YOU'VE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.

24:17.747 --> 24:21.167
PLENTY OF TIME TO
THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE
YOU GIVE ME A DECISION.

24:23.420 --> 24:27.715
MARY, I BROUGHT
A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.011
THERE.

24:36.099 --> 24:40.144
I FIGURED IT SHOULD
RIGHTLY GO TO
THE NEWEST KENDALL.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.438
AND THE PRETTIEST.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.400
A BROOCH.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.404
THANK YOU.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.407
THANK YOU
FOR GIVING ME
A GRANDCHILD,

24:53.575 --> 24:57.328
AND THANK YOU
FOR MAKING ME
A VERY HAPPY MAN.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.248
WELL, I'M STARVING.
LET'S EAT.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.917
I'LL GET THE STEW.

25:03.084 --> 25:04.126
NO, YOU SIT.
YOU SIT.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.629

40:04.318 --> 40:07.570
AND I KNOW MY MAMA
DIDN'T WANT ME.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.114
WELL,
SINCE I CAME HERE,

40:09.281 --> 40:11.950
I'VE BEEN WISHING
YOU WERE MY MAMA.

40:12.118 --> 40:16.413
SO I THOUGHT
SINCE WE BOTH NEEDED
SOMEBODY SO BAD,

40:16.580 --> 40:19.332
WE COULD
BOTH PRETEND.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.458
ELI, I...

40:20.626 --> 40:22.419
PLEASE DON'T
SAY NO RIGHT OFF.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.046
I'D BE LESS TROUBLE
THAN A REAL BABY,

40:25.214 --> 40:26.548
AND IF YOU SAID YES,

40:26.715 --> 40:32.053
I PROMISE I'D TRY
REAL HARD TO BE
WHAT YOU WANTED.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.180
YOU WOULDN'T
BE SORRY.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.186
ELI...

40:52.199 --> 40:54.284
[DOOR KNOCKS]

41:00.708 --> 41:02.750
- ADAM.
- HELLO, FATHER.

41:02.918 --> 41:04.210
COME IN.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.838
SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN, ADAM.

41:13.679 --> 41:14.929
HOW'S MARY?

41:15.097 --> 41:18.183
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT.

41:18.350 --> 41:21.811
BEFORE...BEFORE
ALL THIS HAPPENED,

41:21.979 --> 41:23.771
WE PLANNED TO TELL
YOU THAT WE DECIDED

41:23.939 --> 41:25.773
TO TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER.

41:25.941 --> 41:27.066
OH, WELL, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.194
I WOULDN'T EXPECT
YOU TO GO NOW.

41:29.361 --> 41:31.112
WELL, I THOUGHT SO,
TOO, AT FIRST,

41:31.280 --> 41:33.781
BUT I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK THE BEST
THING FOR MARY

41:33.949 --> 41:35.492
WOULD BE
A COMPLETE CHANGE.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.578
YOU MEAN YOU'RE STILL
THINKING ABOUT GOING?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.955
YES. THE SOONER
THE BETTER.

41:41.123 --> 41:44.125
I JUST CAN'T STAND
TO SEE HER SUFFER
LIKE THIS.

41:44.293 --> 41:49.088
WELL, ADAM, THERE'S
MORE TO THINK ABOUT
THAN MARY'S FEELINGS.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.425
LAW SCHOOL
IS VERY DIFFICULT

41:52.593 --> 41:54.844
EVEN UNDER THE BEST
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

41:55.012 --> 41:57.222
I'VE NEVER BEEN
AFRAID OF HARD WORK.

41:57.389 --> 42:00.141
WELL...

42:00.309 --> 42:03.019
IT'S JUST THAT THERE ARE
OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.525
WHAT THINGS?

42:08.692 --> 42:11.402
WELL, YOUR WIFE,
FOR ONE THING.

42:11.570 --> 42:15.949
NEW YORK CAN BE
A VERY LONELY PLACE.

42:20.037 --> 42:22.163
MARY WILL MAKE
NEW FRIENDS.

42:23.832 --> 42:26.334
BUT SHE'LL BE LEAVING
HER FAMILY HERE.

42:26.502 --> 42:30.004
I'M HER FAMILY.
AND SO ARE YOU.

42:30.172 --> 42:32.632
WELL...

42:32.800 --> 42:36.177
LOOK, I HAVEN'T
GOT TIME TO SOCIALIZE.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.805
I'M VERY BUSY.
VERY.

42:38.973 --> 42:42.725
YOU KNOW,
ALL OF A SUDDEN
I'M HEARING THINGS

42:42.893 --> 42:46.020
THAT YOU DIDN'T
MENTION BEFORE.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.064
IF YOU'RE HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS,
JUST SAY SO.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.941
I'M NOT HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.985
- IT'S...
- IT'S WHAT?

42:52.152 --> 42:53.945
YOU DIDN'T THINK
WE HAD ANY PROBLEMS

42:54.113 --> 42:56.948
BEFORE MARY
LOST THE BABY.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.325
AND WHY NOW,
FATHER?

43:00.536 --> 43:01.995
WHY NOW?

43:04.999 --> 43:07.292
IT WAS THE CHILD,
WASN'T IT?

43:09.044 --> 43:11.045
ALL THIS TIME,

43:11.213 --> 43:13.339
AND IT WAS
THE CHILD.

43:16.218 --> 43:18.052
ANSWER ME.

43:19.763 --> 43:20.888
YOU ANSWER ME,
FATHER.

43:21.056 --> 43:23.224
ALL RIGHT!
YES.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.976
YES.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.865
YOU'RE LEAVING
SO SOON?

43:41.702 --> 43:44.579
WELL, I'VE GOT
TO GET BACK TO COURT.

43:44.747 --> 43:47.582
IT'S A BIG CASE.
IT'S A VERY BIG CASE.

43:47.750 --> 43:51.836
STAGE LEAVES
AT 3:30.

43:52.004 --> 43:54.672
I WAS GOING TO
COME TELL YOU, ADAM.

43:54.840 --> 43:58.384
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.

44:11.607 --> 44:14.609
YOU STILL CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT ME, CAN YOU?

44:23.619 --> 44:25.161
GOOD-BYE, FATHER.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.392
HESTER-SUE?

44:49.019 --> 44:50.395
NO, IT'S ME.

44:51.814 --> 44:54.399
I'LL TAKE
THE 2:00 CLASS.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.319
WHAT?

44:58.487 --> 45:00.988
I SAID, I'LL TAKE
THE 2:00 CLASS.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.534
YOU SURE
YOU FEEL UP TO IT?

45:04.702 --> 45:06.828
I'M SURE.

45:06.995 --> 45:09.414
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
LEFT IN WALNUT GROVE,

45:09.581 --> 45:10.957
BUT WHAT TIME
WE DO HAVE,

45:11.125 --> 45:13.126
I WANT TO SPEND
WITH MY CHILDREN.

45:13.293 --> 45:16.838
THERE'S NO HURRY.

45:17.005 --> 45:19.048
HESTER-SUE AND I
CAN TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.426
ADAM,
I WANT TO TEACH.

45:23.595 --> 45:26.806
I WANT TO THINK
ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE
BESIDES MYSELF.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.186
I...

45:32.354 --> 45:34.856
HAD A TALK
WITH MY FATHER.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.068
HOW SOON DOES
HE WANT US TO LEAVE?

45:40.696 --> 45:43.114
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

45:49.371 --> 45:53.583
FATHER WANTED US TO
LEAVE ON THE STAGECOACH
THIS AFTERNOON.

46:00.716 --> 46:03.634
I MIGHT AS WELL
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

46:05.846 --> 46:09.807
I'VE BEEN HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS
ABOUT THIS.

46:09.975 --> 46:13.519
I KNOW YOU HAD
YOUR HEART SET ON
GOING TO NEW YORK...

46:17.483 --> 46:20.401
BUT I JUST THINK WE'RE
NEEDED MORE HERE.

46:22.404 --> 46:26.282
SO I TOLD MY FATHER
TO GO ON WITHOUT US.

46:28.869 --> 46:31.954
MARY, I KNOW
IT'S NOT BEING
FAIR TO YOU.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.459
ADAM!

46:36.627 --> 46:38.336
FAIR?

46:40.339 --> 46:42.757
IT'S WHAT
I WANTED ALL ALONG.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.428
YOU SWEAR?

46:48.555 --> 46:50.389
OH, I SWEAR!

46:50.557 --> 46:52.183
I SWEAR.

46:53.519 --> 46:57.730
I'VE GOT YOU...
AND I'VE GOT
MY FAMILY...

47:00.609 --> 47:03.611
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]

47:06.907 --> 47:09.826
AND I'VE GOT
MY CHILDREN.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.872
THE SOUND OF
MY CHILDREN.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.843
AND I LOVE YOU.

47:41.483 --> 47:46.487
WE'D BEST GO DOWN THERE
AND...START TEACHING
OUR CHILDREN.

47:48.615 --> 47:51.534
Adam: WHICH PRESIDENTS
SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION?

47:51.702 --> 47:52.660
THOMAS?

47:52.828 --> 47:55.371
Thomas:
WASHINGTON AND...

47:55.539 --> 47:56.497
I DON'T KNOW.

47:56.665 --> 47:57.748
Adam: OH, YOU WILL.

47:57.916 --> 48:00.793
WE'RE GOING TO STUDY
ALL 19 PRESIDENTS.

48:00.961 --> 48:02.086
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR,

48:02.254 --> 48:03.546
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU
ARE GOING TO LEARN

48:03.714 --> 48:07.383
IF IT TAKES MRS. KENDALL
AND I THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
