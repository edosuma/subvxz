00:10.610 --> 00:12.512
- NARRATOR:
He was a humble farmer

00:12.579 --> 00:15.281
until a drought
ravished his land.

00:15.348 --> 00:18.051
Now, he's found a new crop.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.855
- [screaming]

00:21.921 --> 00:24.090
- NARRATOR: Human organs.

He is The Harvester.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.428
Opens this Friday.

00:28.495 --> 00:29.362
- Uh-uh, Lincoln.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.131
You are not seeing that movie.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.999
It is too scary for you.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.668
He pulls around
a cooler full or organs.

00:35.735 --> 00:36.736
- Mom!

00:36.803 --> 00:37.871
- You know how you get.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.038
You'll have nightmares.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.273
You'll think something's
out to get you.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.008
You're just like your father.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.643
- That is a total exaggeration.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.178
On a completely different note
that trailer

00:45.245 --> 00:47.981
is never to be played
in this house again. Yi-ih!

00:48.047 --> 00:50.049
- Come on, mom.
I'm not a baby.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.184
I can handle it.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.219
- MOM: No is my final answer.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.090
- I'm fine not
seeing The Harvester.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.425
It looks way too scary.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.693
And now we get to see
the new Blarney movie!

01:01.795 --> 01:02.996
- Blarney beanies.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.631
Get your free Blarney beanies.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.433
- Ooh! Free Blarney hats?

01:06.499 --> 01:07.600
I'll take two.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.802
- One is fine.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.138
- Get your free Blarney beanies.

01:12.205 --> 01:13.473
- It's not fair.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.309
My parents think I can't
handle a scary movie.

01:18.311 --> 01:21.047
Oh, man! Rusty gets
to see The Harvester?

01:21.114 --> 01:23.516
That guy cried when
a bird flew into the gym.

01:24.684 --> 01:27.754
Maybe I should just go
and not tell my parents.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.456
It's not like they'll find out.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.858
- You know, Blarney has
a song about that, Lincoln.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.368
I'm going to The Harvester.

Please don't take
my gallbladder!

02:02.222 --> 02:04.257
- Guess I don't have
to ask how the movie was.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.694
- I had no idea a man
in overalls could be that scary.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.027
- I'd say "I told you so."

- My parents cannot find
out that I went

02:26.246 --> 02:29.182
to see The Har...har...har...
you know.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.316
That movie.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.351
- Good luck, buddy.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.953
If you need me I'm here 24/7.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.088
But not on Channel two.

02:35.154 --> 02:37.023
That's for Blarnadoons only.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.392
Later.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.362
- Hey, Lincoln.
How was the movie?

02:42.428 --> 02:44.330
- What? I didn't see the movie.

02:44.397 --> 02:48.635
Oh, you mean the Blarney
movie...which I did see.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.437
- Oh, terrific. Hey, can you go
get the ceramic pumpkins?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.006
We're putting up
the fall decorations.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.407
- Sure, dad.
Where are they?

02:54.474 --> 02:56.743
- In the basement.
- The basement?

02:56.809 --> 02:58.044
- DAD: Yeah, in the far back
corner by the light

02:58.111 --> 02:59.212
that burned out.

Want to go look for decorations
in the attic with me?

03:56.169 --> 03:58.905
- No way.
It's creepy up there.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.139
- How about you, Lucy?

04:00.206 --> 04:01.274
You might find a bat.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.442
- I know we will.

But none of them are vampires.

- Ah! Okay...weird.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.057
Why would you want to do that?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.358
- Because I'm a huge fan

05:59.425 --> 06:01.861
of youth-oriented,
glamour-based competitions.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.030

What is up?

- Okay.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.634
I saw a scary movie today
and I'm afraid to be alone.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.169
- Well just go sleep
with mom and dad.

06:10.236 --> 06:11.404
That's what I always do.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.272
- Uh, that's not an option.

- Too busy to give girl advice?
- [gasps]

06:34.627 --> 06:38.064
- Okay, question 63, what
does "going dutch" mean?

06:38.131 --> 06:40.666
And does it have anything
to do with dutch ovens?

- Hmm.

07:35.488 --> 07:37.523
Never heard of night fishing?

07:38.491 --> 07:39.892
- Clyde, come in!

by splitting this pie?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.681
I still got six
more houses to hit.

Hey, you cool with onions, Todd?
No?

How are you going
to grow into a real man

Todd?

Any volunteers
to go check it out?

08:23.870 --> 08:26.939
Oh, sure, you'll eat my pizza,
but when I need something,

as The har...har...

...har...har...har...

09:06.145 --> 09:07.113

the worst night ever.

09:08.848 --> 09:10.383
But at least it's over.

it was carrot?

09:17.723 --> 09:20.760
- DAD: I...Lincoln!
There you are.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.561
- MOM: Sweetie, your father
and I have been talking

09:22.628 --> 09:24.030

28:45.356 --> 28:49.427
- I said health issues,
possible casualty unless...

28:49.494 --> 28:52.197
- Unless what?
Clyde!

28:52.263 --> 28:54.065
Dang it! The walkie's dead!

28:54.132 --> 28:57.335
We can't leave without knowing
if Safe Haven is truly safe.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.870
- I have batteries in my room.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.138
- Looks like we're going up.

29:00.205 --> 29:01.940
Loud, you take front!

29:02.006 --> 29:03.908
- We're all Loud.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.944
- Fine.
Just follow me.

29:08.012 --> 29:11.683
- Uh, let's see, graduated
cylinder, uh, test tube,

29:11.749 --> 29:13.051
enriched uranium.

29:13.118 --> 29:15.854
Here we are.
Two fresh double As.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.422
- LILY: [groaning]

29:17.489 --> 29:19.858
- Don't make any
sudden movements.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.759
- [laughs]

29:21.826 --> 29:22.827
[sneezes]

29:22.894 --> 29:24.696
- Aww. Poor baby.

29:26.231 --> 29:27.365
- [sneezes]

29:28.299 --> 29:30.568
- Incoming!
Hit the deck!

29:31.836 --> 29:33.104
Forgive me Lily!

29:33.171 --> 29:35.540
- No!
- What is wrong with you?

29:35.607 --> 29:38.510
- Our family may be turning
into gross, snotty sickies.

29:38.576 --> 29:41.079
But you are turning
into a monster.

29:41.146 --> 29:42.580
- I'm trying to save us.

29:42.647 --> 29:45.316
And I'm tired of you
acting like Mother Teresa.

29:45.383 --> 29:46.518
- Shows what you know.

29:46.584 --> 29:48.453
Our mother's name is Rita.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.359
- Soup in the hole!

29:57.595 --> 29:59.364
If you two ninnies
are done bickering,

29:59.430 --> 30:01.633
I'd like to go taste
that guacamole.

30:05.336 --> 30:06.871
- Safe Haven, we're back in.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.940
What is this crisis
you were talking about?

30:09.007 --> 30:11.109
- I made a peanut sauce
for the Santé Fe egg rolls.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.978
But, then, I realized someone
might have a food allergy.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.246
- That's the food crisis?

30:15.313 --> 30:17.215
We're fighting
for our lives, Clyde.

30:17.282 --> 30:19.117
No one has a food allergy.

30:19.184 --> 30:20.618
- That's a relief,
'cause this sauce

30:20.685 --> 30:22.153
really ties the dish together.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.688
Safe Haven out.

30:23.755 --> 30:24.756
- Roll out!

30:29.928 --> 30:32.564
- We'll be tasting
freedom in three, two--

30:32.630 --> 30:34.532
- Hey! The bubble is back.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.004
- Okay. Now I'm sick.

30:40.071 --> 30:41.940
See the difference?

30:42.006 --> 30:43.975
- No.
- No.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.410
- [sneezes]

30:45.476 --> 30:48.079
- Argh!
Now the doorknob's infected.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.681
- Uh, don't panic.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.216
I'm sure we'll find
a way out of this...

30:51.282 --> 30:52.650
- [sneezes]

30:52.717 --> 30:54.319
- Dang it.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.154
- [groaning]

30:56.221 --> 30:57.622
- Leni, help me with the table.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.358
- Are you finally gonna
be nice and make them a meal?

31:00.425 --> 31:01.659
- Not exactly.

31:05.063 --> 31:06.331
This doesn't look good, Leni.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.032
There's no way
out of this house.

31:08.099 --> 31:09.434
- Too bad we're not dogs.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.302
Then we could use
Charles's door.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.804
- That's it.
- You go.

31:12.870 --> 31:15.173
I'm gonna stay here
and take care of the sick.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.008
- Don't be a fool.
They're gone.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.277
We have to start a new
world without them.

31:19.344 --> 31:20.645
They'd want it that way.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.814
- I can't.
But don't worry about me.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.617
If I wear a mask
and I'm careful, I'll be okay.

31:25.683 --> 31:27.585
- I may not always agree
with you, Loud,

31:27.652 --> 31:30.588
but I respect you.
Good luck.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.594
- Nah, too blah.

31:36.661 --> 31:37.695
- [groaning]
- [table scraping]

31:37.762 --> 31:40.265
- Too flashy.
Ooh! Perfect!

31:40.331 --> 31:41.566
Goes with my outfit.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.702
- Urgh. Leni! Duck!

31:44.769 --> 31:45.603
- [sneezes]

31:45.670 --> 31:47.972
- A duck? Where?
Is it sick?

31:48.039 --> 31:50.141
- Noooo!

31:51.776 --> 31:54.412
- Lincoln, you saved me. Why?

31:54.479 --> 31:55.780
- 'Cause you've got
a good heart,

31:55.847 --> 31:58.283
and you deserve to survive
more than I do.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.617
- [sneezes]

31:59.684 --> 32:00.918
Dang it.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.788
- [groaning]

32:05.723 --> 32:07.792
- Well, the escape
mission was a bust.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.460
But just because the Louds
are infected

32:09.527 --> 32:10.828
doesn't mean that
they're not human.

32:10.895 --> 32:13.765
Plus, I hate to see all
this good food go to waste.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.935
Who wants Santa Fe egg rolls?

32:18.002 --> 32:19.270
- [groaning]

32:19.337 --> 32:20.471
- Don't forget the peanut sauce.

32:20.538 --> 32:22.040
It's to die for.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.074
Oops! [nervous laugh]
