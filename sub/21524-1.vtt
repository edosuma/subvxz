00:04.500 --> 00:07.100
- What are you doing?
- Hanging out.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.800
- Come over.
- Will, I can't.

00:08.800 --> 00:12.000
Come on, Grace.
You know you want to.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.800
- Of course I want to, but--
- It's gonna be a good one.

00:14.700 --> 00:18.700
- I can feel it.
- It's always good. Still--

00:19.000 --> 00:21.600
If you're not gonna come over,
do you want me to...

00:21.500 --> 00:25.400
talk you through it?

00:25.600 --> 00:29.600
It's tempting, but I think
I'll watch "ER" here.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.700
Another night alone
with my clicker.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.000
Is that what the kids
are calling it?

00:34.900 --> 00:36.900
So I went back to the sale today.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.400
- Did you get that black flowy thing?
- No, you were right.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.800
It's too Stevie Nicks,
the heavy years.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.700
Eriq La Salle just smiled.

00:44.700 --> 00:48.500
- Really?
- No.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.300
- Did you buy anything?
- Yeah, I got a great camisole.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.900
- Sexy?
- Man: I'm going to sleep.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.500
Ask me in the morning.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.800
- Was that Danny?
- Yeah, jealous?

01:01.600 --> 01:04.099
Honey, I don't need your man.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.600
I got George Clooney.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.600
Sorry, babe,
he doesn't bat for your team.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.500
Well, he hasn't seen me pitch.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.700
Okay.
Say, "Good night, Gracie."

01:16.600 --> 01:20.600
Good night, Gracie.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

01:32.800 --> 01:34.500
It's to you, Jack.

01:34.500 --> 01:38.500
Give me a minute,
please? Okay?

01:42.100 --> 01:44.500
 A room without windows 

01:44.400 --> 01:46.700
 A room without doors... 

01:46.600 --> 01:47.800
It's to you, Jack.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.800
Give me a minute, please?

01:50.700 --> 01:53.100
Wow!

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
 A room where no guy
but I can spy that... 

01:57.500 --> 02:00.500
No-ooo, not gonna risk it this time.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.300
Four cards, please.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.400
Here's my ace.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.400
Jack, now that you're moving in,
can I make one small request?

02:09.300 --> 02:10.300
What's that?

02:10.199 --> 02:12.700
Change everything
about your personality.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.800
I get it, comedy.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.900
You didn't tell me
Jack was moving in with you.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.700
Not moving in, he's just staying
until his apartment's finished.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.200
- ( humming )
- Oh, I know that one-- I know--

02:23.100 --> 02:26.700
 Did he need a stronger hand? 

02:26.600 --> 02:29.500
-  Did he need a... 
- Jack!

02:29.300 --> 02:31.100
He's not humming your intro.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.100
That's just a straight guy's
way of thinking

02:33.000 --> 02:34.900
that you and I could
ever be a couple.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.900
Okay, first of all:
Will should only be so lucky.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.800
So let's just clear that right up.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Second of all: you don't
even know me that well.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.900
Why would you just assume
that I was gay?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.100
I finished.
Okay, FYl, folks,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.400
most people that meet me
do not know that I am gay.

02:54.300 --> 02:58.300
Jack, blind and deaf people
know you're gay.

03:00.700 --> 03:04.500
Dead people know you're gay.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.900
- Do we play poker?
- Yes. Come on, who's in?

03:06.700 --> 03:09.700
I'm in for 10.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
I'm fine. Keep playing.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.500
Oh look, it's Sporty Spice.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.200
Did you and Danny have a fight?

03:18.200 --> 03:20.200
Yeah, but I don't wanna
talk about it right now.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.100
- I can't even think straight.
- That's funny, neither can Jack.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.300
Grace, did you know
I was gay when you met me?

03:28.300 --> 03:32.100
My dog knew.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.100
So the fabrics never came in, and
I wasn't able to make the presentation.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.100
Diamond lnteriors got the job.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.400
- I'm sorry. What a disappointment.
- Thank you.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.900
That's all I wanted to hear,
but Danny said,

03:41.800 --> 03:43.400
"When you put everything off
till the last minute..."

03:43.300 --> 03:45.000
- Eew.
- Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.300
And I lost it.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.400
I started screaming, "Why can't you
just let me have my feelings?"

03:50.200 --> 03:54.200
Grace, that is so Barbara DeAngelis,
"Making Love Work."

03:55.400 --> 03:58.400
- I know, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.200
And then he says-- get this,

04:00.100 --> 04:04.100
"You don't have to get hysterical.
You sound just like your mother."

04:04.900 --> 04:08.900
If you were on "Jerry Springer," that's
the minute you'd jump out of your chair.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.300
Can you believe that?

04:11.200 --> 04:13.900
You're staying here tonight. Go wash
your face, I'll make up your bed.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.800
"You sound just like your mother."
What kind of person says that?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.100
The kind of person
you should've dumped a year ago.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.300
- What?
- I said,

04:22.200 --> 04:26.200
I hear they're
re-releasing "Vertigo."

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
"You sound just like your mother."

04:28.100 --> 04:30.500
When you wanna push
someone's buttons, that'll do it.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.400
Hey, roomie!

04:34.900 --> 04:37.200
Jack, you can't move in tonight.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.200
What?

04:39.100 --> 04:41.300
Grace is very upset.
I told her she could stay here tonight.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.000
- You move in tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, that's interesting.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.000
You'd think maybe you could
have told me this-- oh I don't know--

04:45.900 --> 04:49.900
before I packed up
my entire life!

04:50.900 --> 04:53.300
You don't understand,
Grace has had a really--

04:53.200 --> 04:56.200
what's in the hat box?
Your tiara?

04:56.100 --> 05:00.100
Look, Guapo, he made a funny.
Shut up, Will!

05:00.700 --> 05:03.000
I just schlepped all the way
over here from the East Side,

05:02.900 --> 05:05.300
and you know how much Guapo
hates riding in taxis.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.800
Okay.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.000
Okay, take it easy, Jack.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.900
You sound just like your mother.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.500
Crossing the line.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.300
You nasty, bitter,
lonely, balding man.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.100
I don't need this crap
from you, Will.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.200
You know what?
I just don't need it.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.100
- What time tomorrow?
- Eightish.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Fine.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.300
You're my lawyer.
You tell me.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.400
What have I got to do
to buy this company?

05:34.300 --> 05:36.300
First, we've gotta
get something called,

05:36.300 --> 05:38.100
the "Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust" clearance,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.100
and then we can negotiate
standstills and lock ups,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.600
Naturally, that's after
we do due diligence.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.400
What the hell is
"do-do diligence?"

05:45.300 --> 05:49.100
No, Harlan, after we do...
due diligence.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.100
Doesn't matter
how slow you say it,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.500
it's still "do-do", isn't it?

05:55.400 --> 05:58.600
- I just wanna know what it means.
- It's crap that lawyers deal with.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.200
Harlan, I'll handle it.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.600
I've been representing your corporation
for five years now, remember?

06:02.500 --> 06:05.400
I know, but my wife's been
bugging me about the business.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.700
She wants me to be
a little more hands-on.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.600
You sure she's talking
about the business?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.400
Yeah, she's talking
about the business.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.600
But I trust you, Will,
so you do that "do-do"

06:18.500 --> 06:22.100
that you do so well.

06:21.900 --> 06:25.400
- ( intercom buzzes )
- Woman: Will, it's Grace on line one.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.700
Hey.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.600
Can I stay at your apartment
again tonight?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.700
Of course, as long as you want.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.700
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for tissues.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.600
Have your assistant
get them for you.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.300
- She's late again.
- Fire her already.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.200
I'm not gonna fire Karen.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.200
Her social contacts
keep my business afloat.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.700
Why does she even work?

06:42.700 --> 06:44.700
Isn't she worth
like a gazillion dollars?

06:44.600 --> 06:47.500
She feels working
keeps her down to earth.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.500
I know, I'm late.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.200
My driver had another
bronchial incident.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.300
It was disgusting.
I had to raise the partition.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.600
But that's no excuse,
I should be punished.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.700
I'm writing you a check.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.500
Karen, tell Grace
she should fire you.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.900
Grace, tell Will to redirect
his anger at his mother,

07:05.800 --> 07:09.000
where it belongs.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.900
- Call me later.
- Bye.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.800
All right, honey.
There you go.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.900
Guilt be gone.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.900
Karen, I don't want a check.
I want assistance.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.900
I'm the boss,
I give you checks.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.500
Yes you do, honey,
and I love them, I do.

07:23.300 --> 07:27.300
I keep them all
right here in this box.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.400
So, what else?

07:32.400 --> 07:35.900
- Danny and I got into a fight.
- Oh, honey, call him and make up.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.500
Why would I do that?
It wasn't my fault.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
In the long run,
it doesn't matter.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.000
I don't know that
there's gonna be a long run.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.100
Grace, you're--

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
you're what? 40?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.400
I'll be 31 next month.

07:52.300 --> 07:56.300
So I rounded up.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.100
Danny is a good catch.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.700
You've been living together for a year.
Close the deal already.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.300
( phone ringing )

08:03.300 --> 08:06.200
I'm serious Grace, pick up the pace.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm serious, Karen,
pick up the phone.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.900
So, Will, have you seen Michael
since you two broke up?

08:14.800 --> 08:17.200
No, he hasn't, but I have.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.400
Michael's not doing well.
He got fat, he's depressed.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.300
Cheap haircuts, not good.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.500
Actually, it's very sad.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.100
What are you talking about?
I just saw him. Looks great.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Rob, you're dismissed.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.000
- Thanks for trying, sweetie.
- His haircut really was awful.

08:34.900 --> 08:38.799
I know. I think it's time
for "$25,000 Pyramid."

08:38.700 --> 08:40.299
- Rob: Hello!
- Woman: All right!

08:40.200 --> 08:41.900
So, Will, are you gonna
keep the place?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.799
I thought it was gonna
be a little too expensive,

08:43.799 --> 08:46.900
- so I told Jack-- oh no.
- ( knock on door )

08:46.700 --> 08:50.400
Hi, honey, I'm home.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.500
- Are we entertaining? Welcome.
- Jack, I meant to call you today--

08:53.400 --> 08:55.700
- Don't even!
- Wait, wait.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.700
I can stay at Rob
and Ellen's tonight.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.600
No, you can't, Grace,
because apparently, you matter.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.700
How about that?

09:01.600 --> 09:05.500
Jack, I am so sorry.
I just--

09:05.400 --> 09:09.400
Are bandanas back in?
'Cause I didn't get that memo.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.800
Ha, ha-ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.

09:13.900 --> 09:16.000
Let me tell you something,
Will Truman,

09:15.900 --> 09:18.600
I don't need to live here, all right?
And you know what? Guess who loses?

09:18.500 --> 09:20.200
Hello! You do.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.000
Because I could have turned you
into a human being

09:22.900 --> 09:26.100
instead of this rude, self-absorbed,
getting-chunkier-every-day--

09:26.000 --> 09:29.900
oops, did that slip out?
--thing that you are.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.900
- What time tomorrow?
- Eightish.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.800
Fine.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.100
Let's play "The Pyramid."

09:38.100 --> 09:41.100
- Ellen: Okay, you two first.
- Okay, you give, I'll receive.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.800
Just as God intended it.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.200
- Ellen's timing.
- Got it.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.800
Here's your first subject. Go!

09:47.700 --> 09:49.600
Okay, okay.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.600
Driftwood.
John Wayne.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
- You're parents' marriage.
- Things that are dead.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.200
Yes.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.100
My one-night stand on Fire lsland.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.900
- Latin things.
- Good.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.100
The postcard I sent you from ltaly.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
"Everybody Hurts" by REM.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.600
- Things that make you cry.
- Yes.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.500
- Professor Gopnik's teeth.
- Things that are yellow.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.200
Yes.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.000
- A cane. A railing.
- Come on, give me another clue.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.900
Each other.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.300
- Things that you lean on.
- That's it.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.700
Yeah!

10:20.700 --> 10:23.600
You guys--

10:23.500 --> 10:25.200
that was amazing.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.100
Grace, you and Danny
never do this well when we play.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
I know. I'm gonna
break up with him.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.100
It's just time.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.100
My relationship has reached
a fork in the road,

10:36.900 --> 10:40.100
and ending it with Danny
is the right--

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
prong.

10:45.400 --> 10:49.400
Excuse me.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.600
Things that bring a dinner party
to a crashing halt?

10:58.100 --> 11:01.000
- So, how'd it go?
- Not like I thought.

11:00.900 --> 11:03.500
Gracie, I'm sorry.
You give it some time--

11:03.400 --> 11:05.400
No, Will,

11:05.300 --> 11:09.300
he proposed.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.100
- Grace Adler Design?
- Oh, my God, would you look at that?

11:18.900 --> 11:21.000
Who in the world
would be sending--

11:20.900 --> 11:24.900
Oh, carnations,
they must be for you.

11:26.800 --> 11:30.800
Yep, they're from Danny.
Isn't he a sweetheart?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.200
Oh my. Well.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.000
Surprised you're still walking.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.800
Give me that.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.200
He is so great.

11:47.100 --> 11:51.100
I can't believe
I ever doubted he was the one.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.700
Bon appétit.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.000
What am I gonna do about Grace?

11:55.900 --> 11:58.700
What's the big deal?
Why don't you--

11:58.500 --> 12:02.500
could I get a skotch more gravy?
It's a little dry.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.000
If you don't like Danny,
just tell her it's a bad idea.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.400
I don't tell people who to marry.

12:09.300 --> 12:12.200
Okay, you always tell me
what you think of the men I date.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.400
I'm talking about marriage,
not Rudy the Jewish cowboy

12:14.300 --> 12:18.300
you met on the internet.

12:18.100 --> 12:22.100
Shalom, my lonesome
prairie dog.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.900
She's your best friend, Will.
You have to tell her what you think.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.500
- Be honest.
- I can't.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.200
Before my brother
married Ginny,

12:35.100 --> 12:37.100
he asked me what
I honestly thought of her.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.500
I told him, she's morose,
and controlling, and icy.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.500
They got married anyway.
Now she hates me

12:42.400 --> 12:44.700
and my brother and I don't talk.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.900
I couldn't handle
losing Grace like that.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.800
I'm gonna call Rudy again.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.600
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
but more importantly,

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
that's terrible about you
and your brother. It's awful.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.400
No, no, no. Do you have
any mineral water? Sulfites.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.700
When are you moving in?

13:04.600 --> 13:07.800
I'm gonna be away
on business for a while and--

13:07.600 --> 13:09.000
What business?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.400
Business. I have business,
and clients and work-related--

13:12.200 --> 13:14.100
business.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.700
How is the work-related
client business these days?

13:16.600 --> 13:20.600
What is this?
Why do you have to be so mean?

13:21.600 --> 13:24.300
Because you love it.
And I love you,

13:24.100 --> 13:27.100
and you love gel.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.700
And you have a home here
when you get back.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.700
You can be a very great guy
when you wanna be.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.800
Well, I gotta be nicer to you.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.000
- Yes, you do.
- Because you are a good friend.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.900
- Yes, I am.
- I know it's gotta be rough on you.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.700
- Will, don't.
- Being trapped in a man's body like that.

13:48.700 --> 13:52.700
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.300
- What are you watching?
- "Pop-Up Video"

13:55.200 --> 13:59.200
Turns out, Fiona Apple
doesn't particularly like apples.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.400
Apple Brown Betty was invented
by a guy named Darren,

14:02.200 --> 14:06.000
and get this, Bobby Darren's dog
was named Fiona.

14:05.900 --> 14:09.900
What are the odds of that?

14:09.800 --> 14:12.900
- I said, "Yes."
- What?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.200
I said, "Yes."

14:15.100 --> 14:19.100
Oh my God.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.400
Oh my God!

14:21.300 --> 14:25.100
Come here!

14:25.000 --> 14:28.300
Wow. Let's have
a look at that ring.

14:28.100 --> 14:32.100
It's beautiful.
When is the stone being put in?

14:32.800 --> 14:35.000
I knew you were gonna say that.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.100
Wow...

14:36.000 --> 14:39.700
You know, I'm thirsty.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.900
What?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.600
What? What?
I'm happy for you.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.700
Lying.
Lying man talking.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.400
Grace, stop it.
I am happy for you.

14:48.300 --> 14:51.000
I want you two to have
a great life together.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.700
You do?

14:54.500 --> 14:58.200
Thank God.
I was so worried coming over here.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.400
So I have your blessing then?

15:01.200 --> 15:04.900
Yes.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.100
- I love you.
- Love you.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.300
Okay!

15:08.200 --> 15:11.100
- I've gotta go tell my family.
- Grace, don't.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.700
I have to, Will,
they're paying.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.900
No, I mean,
don't marry Danny.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.900
What?

15:18.800 --> 15:22.800
Honey, I gotta be honest.
This guy's not enough for you.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.800
You're passionate,
and you're creative,

15:25.700 --> 15:28.300
and beautiful,
and perfect, and this guy--

15:28.200 --> 15:31.500
you should be with someone more--
somebody else.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.500
He's not funny. He doesn't know
what your favorite flower is.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.400
He's passive-aggressive.
The man high-five's you after sex.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.100
You're so afraid you're
never gonna get married

15:42.000 --> 15:44.700
you can't even see
how wrong he is for you.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.400
Think about it.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.600
If you really believed
he was the one,

15:49.500 --> 15:53.500
would you be asking me
for my blessing?

15:54.600 --> 15:58.600
Go to hell, Will.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.900
No, Rosario,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.800
por favor, honey,
listen to me for a second, okay?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.400
Take Olivia and Mason

16:10.300 --> 16:14.300
to la store de los toys.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.500
- Where's Grace?
- Oh, honey, thank God.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.100
How do you say toy store
in Spanish?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.100
- Tienda de juguetes.
- Uh-huh, thanks.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
F-A-O-yeah-Schwartzo.

16:25.100 --> 16:29.100
Si, si, Rosario, gracias.
Hola.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.100
I haven't slept. I can't get
any work done. Where is she?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.800
Will, just stop right there.
I cannot tell you anything, it's a secret.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.400
- What is?
- She's at City Hall getting married.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.400
Oh, devil.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.800
What? What about the big wedding?

16:46.700 --> 16:48.700
She thought it was best
to get it over with quickly,

16:48.600 --> 16:51.500
not to make a big to-do,
and I say "Brava!"

16:51.400 --> 16:53.600
- Grace--
- Oh, look who's here.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.800
- I'm sorry.
- It's a little late for that.

16:55.700 --> 16:58.100
No, I'm here, Grace.
I'm here to support your marriage.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
- There is no marriage.
- What?

16:59.900 --> 17:03.100
There is no marriage!

17:03.000 --> 17:06.300
And you wanna know why?
Because my best friend--

17:06.200 --> 17:08.500
that would be the part
you're supposed to play--

17:08.400 --> 17:12.099
my best friend dropped a bomb

17:11.900 --> 17:14.800
of poo on my head.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.900
Oh, honey, l--

17:17.800 --> 17:20.300
I was fine.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.099
I was getting married,
and then you come along.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.099
You come and you poison--

17:25.900 --> 17:29.800
with the-- with the thorns
from the-- the flower--

17:30.700 --> 17:33.300
I had this metaphor
worked out earlier,

17:33.200 --> 17:37.200
but I'm just very upset right now.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.400
Gracie, I just want you
to be happy.

17:40.200 --> 17:44.200
No, Will, you want me
to be alone like you.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.600
- Is that the way you see this?
- Yes.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.400
It's interesting,

17:50.300 --> 17:54.300
because I never thought
of myself as being alone.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.000
Well that was a little harsh.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.300
Good.

18:01.300 --> 18:05.300
Yes, yes it is.
He's a bad person, very bad.

18:06.900 --> 18:10.900
Grace, I think it's time
for a couple of blue bippies.

18:11.900 --> 18:15.900
- I don't want any pills.
- They're not for you, they're for me.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.700
Marriage is--
what?

18:20.500 --> 18:23.000
Marriage is--

18:22.900 --> 18:26.800
marriage is. Okay?
What the hell, that's all you need to--

18:26.700 --> 18:29.100
Grace?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.400
She's gone.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.400
She's gone, and I'm sitting here
talking to myself like a crazy person.

18:33.300 --> 18:37.300
Oh my God, listen to me,
I'm still doing it.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.800
Will,

18:47.700 --> 18:51.600
I am-- I am so sorry

18:51.400 --> 18:55.400
for what I said back there.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.100
I know.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.100
It was mean, but-- I know.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.900
This morning, on the way
to the ceremony,

19:13.700 --> 19:16.200
Danny looked at me and said,

19:16.100 --> 19:19.400
"I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life with you."

19:19.300 --> 19:22.700
And I turned to him and said,

19:22.500 --> 19:26.500
"You know the limo
has a phone?"

19:27.600 --> 19:29.900
It wasn't right.

19:29.800 --> 19:33.200
He was a smart
attractive man who loved me,

19:33.100 --> 19:36.200
and who I loved, by the way.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.600
Why wasn't it right?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.500
Sweetie,

19:40.400 --> 19:43.000
remember in college
we saw that French film

19:42.900 --> 19:45.100
about a man and a woman
that were perfect for one another,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.800
but they kept missing each other.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.100
And in the last scene,
they meet on a plane,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.200
because that's the way
it was destined to be.

19:51.100 --> 19:55.100
Remember? And you said,
"That's gonna be me."

19:56.300 --> 19:59.000
Gracie, you're just
in the middle of your movie.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.900
Danny was a plot point.
A nice, decent,

20:01.800 --> 20:05.800
postcoital high-fiving
plot point.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.800
There's still time.
Go get some Raisinettes.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.900
- I like Red Vines.
- Whatever you want.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.800
The point is, it's not over if your movie's
gonna have a happy ending.

20:17.100 --> 20:20.600
- You just have to see it through.
- Oh God.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.500
- Come here.
- Huh-uh.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.600
What do you say
we go get a drink?

20:29.500 --> 20:33.500
Yes-ss.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.300
- What is with that dress?
- Give me a break.

20:36.200 --> 20:40.200
- I had five minutes to prepare for this.
- Still.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.300
What are we to toast
to your lovely new bride?

20:46.200 --> 20:50.200
All: Yeah!

20:51.400 --> 20:53.400
Here's to the ball and chain.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.500
If she makes it
through the night, ba-bing,

20:55.400 --> 20:59.400
I think I'll keep her.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.300
Wait, my turn.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.700
To my Will.

21:06.600 --> 21:10.500
You are my hero,
and my soul mate.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.500
And I'm a better woman
for loving you.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.800
All: Oo-ooh!

21:14.700 --> 21:17.300
Hey, hey, hey...
Come on, you two.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.200
- How's about a kiss?
- All: Yeah!

21:21.200 --> 21:25.200
All:
Kiss, kiss, kiss...

21:33.300 --> 21:37.300
- Nothing? Anything?
- Sorry, no, it's--
