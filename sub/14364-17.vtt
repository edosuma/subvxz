Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:08.782 --> 02:11.084
Don't tell me
Mech never considered

02:11.086 --> 02:13.486
that an open-channel
distress signal

02:13.488 --> 02:16.223
from an injured Decepticon
might be a trap.

02:16.225 --> 02:18.859
I'll bear that in mind
next time.

02:18.861 --> 02:20.862
Next time?

02:20.864 --> 02:23.965
Decepticon radio chatter
is all abuzz

02:23.967 --> 02:27.469
about the work over
you gave poor Breakdown.

02:27.471 --> 02:29.104
As an ex-con myself,

02:29.106 --> 02:32.341
I really should eviscerate you
for that.

02:32.343 --> 02:36.846
But an old acquaintance
and her nasty, little human

02:36.848 --> 02:40.349
destroyed my ship
and skinned my knee.

02:40.351 --> 02:43.753
I mean to pay them back
in kind... both of them.

02:43.755 --> 02:48.324
You see, I make it in and out of
places most Decepticons can't,

02:48.326 --> 02:51.893
but I'm still learning
to navigate this planet.

02:51.895 --> 02:53.594
What's in it for Mech?

02:53.596 --> 02:55.062
I'll let you live.

02:55.064 --> 02:57.665
And, since you came
to collect...

02:57.667 --> 02:59.534
A transformer, was it?...

02:59.536 --> 03:05.407
I'll throw in whatever's left
of Arcee after I've broken her.

03:07.577 --> 03:09.979
Thanks for walking
me home, Jack.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.414
You're a real gentleman.

03:11.416 --> 03:15.920
I don't want you revved up
before bedtime.

03:15.922 --> 03:17.121
Mom's a light sleeper,

03:17.123 --> 03:19.457
and I don't think
she'd understand about...

03:19.459 --> 03:20.991
Understand what, Jack?

03:20.993 --> 03:24.294
You breaking curfew
for the third time this month?

03:24.296 --> 03:25.662
Mom.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.830
Or why your boss called

03:26.832 --> 03:28.899
about you missing
another shift at work?

03:28.901 --> 03:31.836
Or maybe the e-mail I received
from your Art history teacher,

03:31.838 --> 03:34.939
who's concerned that you've been
falling asleep in class.

03:34.941 --> 03:38.509
Well, two words, mom...
"Art" and "history."

03:38.511 --> 03:40.344
Tell me the rumors
aren't true, Jack.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.746
Tell me you're not racing
that motorcycle.

03:42.748 --> 03:45.082
No, no. Wait, wait.
Where did you hear <i>that?</i>

03:45.084 --> 03:46.750
Small town. People talk.

03:46.752 --> 03:49.252
I work
in an emergency room, Jack.

03:49.254 --> 03:51.054
I've seen what can happen.

03:51.056 --> 03:54.657
So, please tell me you haven't
fallen in with a bad crowd?

03:54.659 --> 03:56.325
What? N-no.
No, no, no.

03:56.327 --> 03:59.195
My friends are the good crowd.
Seriously good.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.529
I let you have that bike

04:00.531 --> 04:03.065
because you convinced me you
were mature enough to handle it.

04:03.067 --> 04:06.001
But I think you may need
a gentle reminder.

04:06.003 --> 04:08.303
Message received, mom.
Loud and clear.

04:08.305 --> 04:10.371
I'm... I'm glad
we had this talk.

04:10.373 --> 04:12.406
I meant,
let's see if a few weeks

04:12.408 --> 04:15.843
without the distraction of your
motorcycle will do the trick.

04:15.845 --> 04:17.111
- But...
- No buts.

04:17.113 --> 04:20.281
You're grounded from everything
but school and work.

04:20.283 --> 04:25.254
And if you want to take a bike
to either, you'll pedal.

04:27.925 --> 04:29.258
Serious face, Jack.

04:29.260 --> 04:32.262
If I see that motorcycle
out of the garage...

04:35.000 --> 04:37.668
Now go wash up
and get some sleep.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.336
I love you.

04:41.306 --> 04:43.908
I'll miss you
while you're grounded.

04:43.910 --> 04:46.844
Don't worry, Arcee.
I'll visit you here every day.

04:46.846 --> 04:48.579
Uh, Jack?
I won't be here.

04:48.581 --> 04:51.549
Sitting on my fat tires
for two weeks is not an option.

04:51.551 --> 04:53.551
No, no, no.
You saw mom's serious face.

04:53.553 --> 04:55.253
Look, Arcee,
I feel badly enough

04:55.255 --> 04:57.355
that I've had to lie to her
all this time,

04:57.357 --> 04:58.523
but if you're not here,

04:58.525 --> 05:00.692
she's gonna think that
I'm blowing her off.

05:00.694 --> 05:03.495
Deep breaths, Jack.
Your mom works late nights.

05:03.497 --> 05:06.733
I'll try to be back in the
garage before she gets home.

05:06.735 --> 05:09.168
But no promises.

05:17.078 --> 05:18.344
Hey, ma.

05:18.346 --> 05:20.980
Jack, I hope you're not planning
to eat takeout tonight.

05:20.982 --> 05:22.248
I took my break early

05:22.250 --> 05:24.683
so I could cook my grounded son
a wholesome dinner.

05:24.685 --> 05:26.952
Organic tofu?
Awesome.

05:26.954 --> 05:29.087
Hey, car beats 10-speed.

05:29.089 --> 05:32.190
I'll be home soon.
Love you, bye.

05:33.260 --> 05:35.993
Come on, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

05:35.995 --> 05:37.128
Arcee?

05:37.130 --> 05:39.830
You wouldn't be in the garage
right now?

05:39.832 --> 05:42.333
Negative, Jack.

05:42.335 --> 05:44.235
Can we talk about this later?

05:44.237 --> 05:45.936
No.
Mom's on her way home.

05:45.938 --> 05:48.272
If you don't race
back there right now,

05:48.274 --> 05:49.908
I will be grounded for life.

05:49.910 --> 05:52.243
And mom will make me
sell you for parts.

05:52.245 --> 05:54.312
Bee, can you handle it?

05:56.416 --> 05:58.783
Ratchet, I need a bridge.

06:40.793 --> 06:44.228
Jack! Jack, I can't believe
you disobeyed me.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.096
Where is the motorcycle?

06:46.098 --> 06:49.333
Uh, what do you mean?

06:49.335 --> 06:51.535
She's right where I left her.

06:57.943 --> 07:00.677
Did you get one of your crew
to sneak it in,

07:00.679 --> 07:02.846
or did you just
walk it up again?

07:04.150 --> 07:08.285
Okay, mom,
you really want to know?

07:10.021 --> 07:12.856
Fasten your seatbelt.

07:13.924 --> 07:16.459
My motorcycle
is a sentient robotic organism

07:16.461 --> 07:17.760
from a distant planet,

07:17.762 --> 07:19.996
part of a team
stationed here on earth

07:19.998 --> 07:21.297
fighting a secret war,

07:21.299 --> 07:23.566
and I spend most of my time
after school

07:23.568 --> 07:24.801
hanging with her crew.

07:28.639 --> 07:29.639
Jack.

07:29.641 --> 07:31.140
And the coolest thing...

07:31.142 --> 07:33.276
This isn't even
her actual form.

07:33.278 --> 07:36.879
She's really a giant robot who
can transform into a vehicle.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.547
Enough, Jack.

07:38.549 --> 07:40.816
It's okay, Arcee.
Show yourself.

07:45.454 --> 07:47.289
She's... she's shy.

07:47.291 --> 07:50.258
Arcee? Really.
No more hiding.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.626
No more lies.

07:54.697 --> 07:57.165
Oh, come on, roll out already.

07:57.167 --> 08:01.670
So, um...The bad crowd
you've been hanging out with

08:01.672 --> 08:03.972
is a science-fiction club?

08:06.376 --> 08:08.711
I have to get back to work.

08:08.713 --> 08:11.715
We will continue this
when I get home.

08:14.153 --> 08:16.987
Thanks for the support,
partner.

08:16.989 --> 08:19.989
- Don't blame me.
- Remember...

08:19.991 --> 08:22.825
I know, I know.
You don't exist.

08:22.827 --> 08:24.426
Your ship's black box

08:24.428 --> 08:26.595
sustained serious damage
in the explosion.

08:26.597 --> 08:30.064
But our software was able
to reconstruct a few frames

08:30.066 --> 08:31.632
from the security feed.

08:31.634 --> 08:33.366
That's him.

08:33.369 --> 08:35.368
My Jack.

08:35.370 --> 08:37.070
Our facial-recognition
algorithm

08:37.072 --> 08:39.039
will send Jack's image
across the web.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.508
Another kind of web.

08:41.510 --> 08:43.943
Ah, the mother lode.

08:43.946 --> 08:46.380
Government database?

08:46.382 --> 08:47.981
Social-networking page.

08:47.983 --> 08:51.652
Everything worth knowing
about Jack Darby is right here.

08:51.654 --> 08:54.388
Age, 16.
Jasper, Nevada.

08:54.390 --> 08:59.126
Mother...
June Darby, a nurse.

09:00.729 --> 09:03.197
Maybe I'm being too hard
on Jack, but he lied,

09:03.199 --> 09:06.099
and the only way he's gonna
learn is if I stick to my...

09:18.326 --> 09:20.794
Arcee, is mom home yet?

09:20.796 --> 09:22.028
I didn't see her car.

09:22.030 --> 09:24.564
Don't know. I just bridged
from base to beat her here.

09:24.566 --> 09:26.932
Oh, and there's a package
for you.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.204
Hello, Jack.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.205
Silas.

09:34.207 --> 09:37.676
What is it?
W-what's going on?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.978
- Mech.
- They know where I live?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.913
We know things
about your family

09:41.915 --> 09:43.348
that even you don't know.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.984
For example, do you know
where your mother is?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.286
What did you...

09:47.288 --> 09:50.757
Understand, Jack, we have
no intention of hurting her.

09:50.759 --> 09:53.193
In fact, we'd like
to reunite the two of you

09:53.195 --> 09:54.394
as soon as possible.

09:54.396 --> 09:55.862
I just need you and Arcee

09:55.864 --> 09:57.430
to follow the GPS coordinates

09:57.432 --> 09:59.499
programmed
into this communicator.

09:59.501 --> 10:02.234
They'll lead you to the
temporary facility I've set up.

10:02.236 --> 10:04.170
Ratchet?

10:04.172 --> 10:06.339
Aah! Aaah!

10:06.341 --> 10:07.573
- Aaaah!
- Arcee?

10:07.575 --> 10:09.942
Did I not mention
our communicator

10:09.944 --> 10:12.544
scrambles the signal
<i>and</i> your brains?

10:12.546 --> 10:14.046
Any break in communication

10:14.048 --> 10:17.149
or attempt to reach the other
Autobots and miss Darby...

10:17.151 --> 10:22.488
Well, I wouldn't want to feel
responsible for the outcome.

10:33.234 --> 10:34.434
If anything happens to her

10:34.436 --> 10:36.236
because of my connection
to all this...

10:36.238 --> 10:38.605
Jack, Mech
is only interested in me.

10:38.607 --> 10:41.808
Once they get what they want,
they'll let your mom go.

10:41.810 --> 10:45.078
That's not exactly reassuring.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.113
You're family, too.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.829
So what's the plan?

11:02.831 --> 11:04.364
The usual.

11:16.911 --> 11:20.280
Mom?!

11:20.282 --> 11:21.982
Looking for June?

11:21.984 --> 11:25.452
She's hanging
around here somewhere.

11:25.454 --> 11:26.820
Airachnid.

11:29.091 --> 11:30.357
What's she doing here?

11:35.096 --> 11:36.330
Help them, please.

11:36.332 --> 11:37.865
They're human, like you.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.533
You can't let Airachnid...

11:39.535 --> 11:42.203
A few human lives
are a small price to pay

11:42.205 --> 11:44.771
for a miracle of science
like yourself.

11:49.512 --> 11:50.577
Arcee!

11:52.147 --> 11:55.416
You and I will have
a private session later.

11:55.418 --> 11:56.617
Promise.

11:56.619 --> 11:58.686
Gentlemen.

12:03.726 --> 12:06.160
I'm still learning
about humankind,

12:06.162 --> 12:08.596
but one thing
is clear to me, Jack...

12:08.598 --> 12:10.966
You people care deeply
about family.

12:10.968 --> 12:15.036
Therefore, the sweetest revenge
I could possibly devise

12:15.038 --> 12:19.841
would be to make you watch
as I take your family apart.

12:19.843 --> 12:22.009
If you hurt my mother...

12:22.011 --> 12:25.479
You remember how much I enjoy
sport, don't you, Jack?

12:25.481 --> 12:28.982
So I'll give you the opportunity
to save your mother.

12:28.984 --> 12:30.717
I've stashed her close by.

12:30.719 --> 12:34.153
If you can rescue her
before the stroke of 12:00,

12:34.155 --> 12:38.659
I will let both of you
go unharmed.

12:38.661 --> 12:39.693
Deal?

12:39.695 --> 12:41.062
And if I can't?

12:41.064 --> 12:44.866
What do you think?

12:44.868 --> 12:46.568
Please don't let her do this.

12:46.570 --> 12:48.570
You can let us go.
We... we won't tell anyone.

12:48.572 --> 12:50.139
Enough.

12:50.141 --> 12:52.108
Yes, Jack.

12:52.110 --> 12:54.744
Man up already.

12:54.746 --> 12:56.313
Six minutes.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.887
Mom?

13:03.889 --> 13:05.889
Mom!

13:05.891 --> 13:08.825
Now I know we promised
the spider bot

13:08.827 --> 13:11.895
that she would have
first crack at you,

13:11.897 --> 13:15.166
but something tells me she plans
to turn our mutual crisscross

13:15.168 --> 13:17.501
into a double-cross.

13:17.503 --> 13:22.240
Silas, we don't have the means
of transporting it right now.

13:22.242 --> 13:25.277
We'll have to cut and run.

13:25.279 --> 13:27.513
Open her up.

13:55.827 --> 13:57.427
Mom!

13:59.097 --> 14:00.164
Mom!

14:02.968 --> 14:04.201
Jack?!

14:14.912 --> 14:16.946
Jack, what are you doing here?

14:16.948 --> 14:18.281
Who are these people?

14:18.283 --> 14:20.316
How did I
get in this...stuff?

14:20.318 --> 14:23.553
Don't worry, mom.
I'm gonna get you out. Aah!

14:27.559 --> 14:31.393
Jack,
the robots are real?

14:31.395 --> 14:32.628
I beat your deadline.

14:32.630 --> 14:34.297
Afraid not, Jack.

14:34.299 --> 14:37.600
The task wasn't for you
to <i>find</i> your mother by midnight.

14:37.602 --> 14:38.968
You had to <i>rescue</i> her.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.139
And time's up.

14:43.141 --> 14:44.707
Now...

14:44.709 --> 14:45.975
Aah!

14:48.179 --> 14:49.879
<i>Take a seat.</i>

14:49.881 --> 14:53.583
<i>Sit back and enjoy</i>
<i>the horror show.</i>

14:53.585 --> 14:55.851
Make haste, gentlemen.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.087
Don't worry about making a mess.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.824
You know, Jack, she's your mom.

15:01.826 --> 15:04.361
Why should I have all the fun?

15:04.363 --> 15:06.796
So, you get to choose...

15:06.798 --> 15:10.833
Agonizing or excruciating?

15:14.739 --> 15:16.872
No. No.

15:22.344 --> 15:25.279
<i>Jack,</i>
<i>your mother wants to know.</i>

15:25.281 --> 15:27.414
<i>Don't leave her dangling.</i>

15:27.416 --> 15:29.116
<i>You monster!</i>

15:29.118 --> 15:30.651
<i>Stop this!</i>

15:34.890 --> 15:37.559
We only have time
to take one part.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.461
Go straight for the heart.

15:56.913 --> 15:58.246
Let her go.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.682
No matter the outcome,
the spoils will be ours.

16:02.784 --> 16:06.053
Well, Jack,
if you won't decide...

16:06.055 --> 16:09.589
Aah! I guess it's lady's choice.

16:11.226 --> 16:13.159
Mom, I'm sorry.

16:15.864 --> 16:17.398
No!

16:19.569 --> 16:20.935
Aaaaah!

16:24.741 --> 16:26.875
Jack, your motorcycle?

16:26.877 --> 16:28.777
I can explain, mom.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.047
Wait, I already did.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.988
Mech lost Breakdown...

16:38.990 --> 16:40.857
What were the odds
they could hold on to you?

17:03.282 --> 17:04.848
Aah! Aah!

17:04.851 --> 17:07.018
Ohh!

17:07.020 --> 17:08.520
Jack!
Mom!

17:08.521 --> 17:11.155
Jaaaack!

18:06.142 --> 18:08.743
Aaaaah!

18:13.082 --> 18:16.652
Aah! Jack!

18:19.223 --> 18:22.392
Hang on, June.

18:30.104 --> 18:31.803
Aim for the creepy crawly.

18:44.549 --> 18:47.117
How did they find us?

18:51.221 --> 18:54.523
You can let us go.
We... we won't tell anyone.

19:00.197 --> 19:01.898
Thanks for coming,
agent Fowler.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.566
If I'd known
'cons were involved,

19:03.568 --> 19:05.068
I would have called in prime.

19:05.070 --> 19:08.905
That might have been too much
for mom to handle in one night.

19:24.525 --> 19:26.726
Ah, not again!

19:39.273 --> 19:40.307
No!

19:42.710 --> 19:46.380
So that's how it's done.

19:46.382 --> 19:47.915
Genius.

19:53.888 --> 19:57.658
Mrs. Darby, I'm special agent
William Fowler.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.760
It's time you knew the truth.

19:59.762 --> 20:01.829
For the past several months,

20:01.831 --> 20:04.832
Jack has been interning
for me at the agency.

20:04.834 --> 20:07.902
Agent Fowler,
mom's not gonna buy it.

20:07.904 --> 20:09.570
He's got that right.

20:09.572 --> 20:10.805
Agent Fowler.

20:10.807 --> 20:13.641
Let me guess...
Without a trace.

20:13.643 --> 20:16.277
Argh!

20:19.682 --> 20:23.352
And she would be your...

20:23.354 --> 20:27.690
Motorcycle, guardian,
autobot, friend.

20:29.926 --> 20:32.360
Call me Arcee.

20:35.898 --> 20:37.999
Thank you, Arcee.

20:41.236 --> 20:45.039
I think it's time for that ride
you once made me promise.

21:20.809 --> 21:23.845
Mom, meet
my science-fiction club.
