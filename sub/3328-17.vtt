00:01.300 --> 00:04.098
Previously on Elementary:
This is Manny Tarkanian.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.098
I'm gonna text you
my contact information.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.267
Are you gonna answer that?

00:08.300 --> 00:09.437
Gareth Lestrade,

00:09.470 --> 00:10.630
late of Scotland Yard.

00:10.670 --> 00:11.762
I owe you an apology.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.209
We've got to
accommodate each other.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.434
I realize that now.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.731
Apology accepted.
You know, the company's

00:15.780 --> 00:17.645
not paying
for my hotel anymore.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.647
You can stay here.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.715
Just be quiet.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.570
We own chickens,
don't we?

00:22.850 --> 00:25.341
(blows, sniffs)

00:25.390 --> 00:28.018
(device beeping)

00:32.100 --> 00:33.294
LESTRADE:
Holmes!

00:33.330 --> 00:35.821
Your bloody rooster
is at it again!

00:35.860 --> 00:37.828
19 days.
19 days he has been here.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.338
WATSON:
Well, you were the one
who said he could

00:40.370 --> 00:43.407
stay with us until he
figured out his next move.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.839
LESTRADE:
Holmes!

00:44.870 --> 00:47.771
I'll pluck it! I swear it!

00:47.810 --> 00:50.472
He has offers, remember?
Course he does.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.819
He took credit for my successes
at Scotland Yard.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.579
Typically, a man is his work.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.144
In his case, he is my work--

00:56.190 --> 00:57.817
and who wouldn't want
to hire me?

00:57.850 --> 01:01.616
You said your friend
made that for you?

01:01.660 --> 01:02.786
Demolitions expert.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.082
He sends me devices
from time to time.

01:05.130 --> 01:07.826
I'd hardly call him a friend.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.590
And what happens
if it hits zero?

01:10.630 --> 01:12.291
I confess to not knowing.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.798
Could be a spray of paint
and expulsion of fumes.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.229
I have yet to fail...

01:18.270 --> 01:20.602
at defusing one.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.779
(rapid beeping)

01:22.810 --> 01:24.846
LESTRADE:
Holmes!

01:24.880 --> 01:26.518
I want to see what he wants.
Yeah.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.157
LESTRADE: Holmes!
Can I get some help, please?!

01:32.190 --> 01:34.351
Hey.
Hi, Joan, brilliant.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.812
This one's got it
in for me. I swear.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.259
Was it...
it was Remus?

01:37.290 --> 01:38.655
Actually that's Romulus.

01:38.690 --> 01:40.248
Every time I go for
the remote control

01:40.300 --> 01:42.268
to turn the TV on,
it spreads its wings

01:42.300 --> 01:43.790
and it comes at me.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.798
Hey, Romulus.
You want a little treat?

01:45.830 --> 01:47.195
Oh, here you go.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.458
Ah, treat's in the pocket,
very nice.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.137
(muttering):
And then you go...

01:51.170 --> 01:53.604
Oh, brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.278
Well done, you.
Thank you very much.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.471
I've got a few quids riding
on this match, actually.

01:57.510 --> 01:58.477
My pleasure.

01:58.510 --> 01:59.511
Uh,Joan?
Hmm?

02:00.920 --> 02:02.387
I wanted to say thank you

02:02.420 --> 02:03.887
for being
so patient with me

02:03.920 --> 02:07.788
and all this, you know,
the job's bullocks.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.880
Sherlock's sick of the sight
of my face, isn't he?

02:10.930 --> 02:12.921
Well, you have
a big decision to make, so...

02:12.960 --> 02:14.848
Well, you know,
actually, I got a...

02:14.900 --> 02:16.299
another offer today, in fact.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.797
Here.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.629
Largest investigation company
in Sao Paulo, Brazil,

02:21.670 --> 02:23.160
Romero e Blanco.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.359
Oh.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.298
Do you speak Portuguese?

02:26.340 --> 02:28.228
Do I speak Portuguese?

02:28.280 --> 02:30.271
Well... mmm...

02:30.310 --> 02:31.948
no, not currently.

02:31.980 --> 02:36.713
Oh, and you might want
to take a look at some of those

02:36.750 --> 02:38.741
offers on the table,
you know?

02:38.790 --> 02:41.918
See, you might find one
that you prefer more than...

02:41.960 --> 02:43.427
working for
the ol' cock-handler.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.227
Uh...

02:45.260 --> 02:46.852
Uh, I know what you meant.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.834
It's me, okay?

02:56.870 --> 02:57.905
You got me.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.305
Excuse me?

02:59.340 --> 03:00.568
I'm him.

03:00.610 --> 03:02.271
The guy you see on the news.

03:02.310 --> 03:03.868
I'm Gordon Cushing.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.442
That's what you're
trying to figure out, right?

03:09.720 --> 03:11.347
Did you do it?

03:13.790 --> 03:16.918
Pull over here, would you?
I'd like to get out.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.724
(footsteps approaching)

03:46.390 --> 03:48.381
*

04:14.020 --> 04:15.874
GREGSON:
His name is Gordon Cushing,

04:15.920 --> 04:17.444
but maybe you already know that.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.946
JOAN:
His wife
disappeared in 2010.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.014
Everyone thought
he killed her.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.051
It was in all
the papers back then.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.785
I endeavored to keep abreast

04:23.830 --> 04:25.889
of notorious crimes
In other countries,

04:25.930 --> 04:28.728
but I confess to falling out
of the habit during my habit.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.524
His wife Sarah was a partier.
He didn't approve.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.435
They fought a lot,

04:33.470 --> 04:34.095
and so when she went missing...

04:34.140 --> 04:35.596
He was presumed a murderer?

04:35.640 --> 04:36.629
He was,
but without a body,

04:36.670 --> 04:38.729
no one could make a case.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.601
A few hours ago, he called 911

04:40.640 --> 04:43.302
to say he received a box
with two severed ears.

04:43.350 --> 04:47.070
There was a note inside saying
they were his wife Sarah's.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.839
If he forks over two million
in cash to the person

04:49.890 --> 04:52.711
or persons who took her,
he gets her back.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.614
And it's odd
to get a ransom demand

04:54.660 --> 04:56.423
four years after an abduction.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.882
Well, you think that's odd.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.625
This isn't the first time
that he's claimed

04:59.660 --> 05:00.957
to have been contacted
by kidnappers.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.820
He said he got a call
from someone

05:02.870 --> 05:04.599
a year after
Sarah disappeared, right?

05:04.630 --> 05:07.394
Yeah, she disappeared
in May 2010.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.035
At the time, he said that she
just packed her bags and left.

05:11.070 --> 05:15.678
But, allegedly,
he gets a call in June of 2011.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.644
The guy says that he took her.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.874
He even puts her

05:18.910 --> 05:20.468
on the phone with him.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.738
Cushing follows
his instructions to a tee.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.712
Doesn't call us,
doesn't call the FBI,

05:24.750 --> 05:26.718
just gathers up
a million bucks in cash

05:26.760 --> 05:29.479
and leaves it under a tree
in Central Park.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.883
Days go by,

05:30.930 --> 05:32.659
no sign of Sarah.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.895
That's when he decides
to reach out to the department.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.864
Only he couldn't prove that
anyone had contacted him,

05:36.900 --> 05:38.959
so people thought he'd
made the whole thing up.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.662
Well, obviously, he didn't
make up two severed ears.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.803
I'm about to talk to him.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.762
Thought you might
want to sit in.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.043
I know how this
is going to sound,

05:51.080 --> 05:54.516
but this is a good thing,
isn't it?

05:54.550 --> 05:56.745
I mean, Sarah's alive.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.714
The M.E. is comparing the ears
to strands of hair

05:59.760 --> 06:03.685
_ that we collected from a_ brush
In your master bathroom In 2010.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.824
If the DNA is a match,
then yes...

06:06.860 --> 06:08.589
it's a good chance
she's still alive.

06:08.630 --> 06:09.699
The ears are Sarah's.

06:09.730 --> 06:11.061
I know they are.
I... Just look

06:11.100 --> 06:12.636
at the photographs
I brought you.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.535
Mm-hmm.

06:15.970 --> 06:18.109
Wait.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.608
You still think
I killed her, don't you?

06:20.640 --> 06:23.768
You think I... took those ears
from someone else

06:23.810 --> 06:25.072
and sent them to myself?

06:25.110 --> 06:27.544
No. I'm more concerned
with what I know.

06:27.580 --> 06:30.743
I know someone was mutilated
earIIer tonIght.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.179
I know I want to help her.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.687
She is Sarah.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.948
She's alive...

06:35.990 --> 06:37.821
Just like she was
alive in 2011?

06:37.860 --> 06:40.158
The last time you were asked
to finance her safe return?

06:41.500 --> 06:42.819
I dare say that ransom demands

06:42.870 --> 06:44.622
are becoming
a tradition for you.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.490
I know I made a mistake
three years ago.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.838
I should have called the police
the second I got off the phone

06:48.870 --> 06:50.201
with the kidnapper,
but I was scared,

06:50.240 --> 06:52.606
and Sarah was...
she was terrified.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.676
I didn't want to take
any chances. I couldn't.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.741
There are phone records
that show

06:59.780 --> 07:01.645
I got the call
when I said I did.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.682
Bank statements
that show I took out

07:03.720 --> 07:05.187
a million dollars.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.687
You could've called
from a burner phone.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.608
You could've hidden
that money anywhere.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.754
I have never been anything
but honest with you people.

07:11.790 --> 07:14.588
And so I'm going to keep
being honest with you now.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.162
I fell out of love with my wife
a long time

07:19.200 --> 07:21.088
before she disappeared.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.507
She said and did things
when she was drinking

07:24.540 --> 07:25.700
that I can never forgive.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.479
I don't want her back
because I miss her.

07:30.510 --> 07:35.777
I want her back because I am
tired of people looking at me

07:35.820 --> 07:38.448
the way you people
are looking at me right now.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.821
HOLMES: Well, they do bear
an uncanny resemblance

07:43.860 --> 07:44.884
to the ears
in the photograph.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.693
Mmm.

07:46.730 --> 07:48.493
It's hardly proof
that they came from

07:48.530 --> 07:50.669
the head of
Sarah Cushing, though.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.689
WATSON:
What did you think of Gordon?

07:51.730 --> 07:53.197
Well, he seemed
quite sincere.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.505
But then, so did infamous
zoophile Ebenezer Cornell

07:56.540 --> 07:58.132
when he claimed
he had not attempted

07:58.170 --> 08:00.570
to violate two ostriches
at London Zoo.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.804
So...

08:01.840 --> 08:04.502
What did you think
of Mr. Cushing?

08:04.550 --> 08:07.110
Well, it was interesting being
in the same room with him.

08:07.150 --> 08:09.141
Before tonight, I'd only
ever seen him on the news.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.215
Mm-hmm.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.740
If he's telling
the truth,

08:11.790 --> 08:13.849
then I guess
I feel sorry for him.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.812
It would mean that_ someone
made a pretty tragIc mIstake

08:15.860 --> 08:16.952
when they accused him.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.287
(ringtone playing)

08:18.330 --> 08:20.958
Speaking of
"tragic mistakes."

08:21.000 --> 08:23.867
"Hate to bother,
but locked out of house."

08:23.900 --> 08:24.992
Remarkable.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.258
"Looked under front
and back mats."

08:26.300 --> 08:27.858
Oh. "Found no keys."

08:27.900 --> 08:29.538
'Cause that's
the kind of man I am.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.902
I leave keys under doormats.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.798
I don't know why
you're peeking inside.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.806
You know we're not in there.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.875
Trying to assess
the damage, actually.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.309
What happened?

08:43.350 --> 08:45.079
Well, you know
that football game

08:45.120 --> 08:46.849
that I put a bet on?

08:46.890 --> 08:48.858
I actually won.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.949
Yeah, I went to go get
the winnings on the way back.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.821
Got myself
into a bit of trouble.

08:52.860 --> 08:53.849
A rather unfriendly bloke

08:53.900 --> 08:55.754
took designs on my
watch and wallet.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.994
You got mugged.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.101
(Watson sighs)

09:03.140 --> 09:04.903
I still think
you should go to a hospital.

09:04.940 --> 09:05.929
What about this?

09:05.970 --> 09:07.073
I've been kissed harder.

09:07.110 --> 09:08.600
Crying out loud.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.846
Bloody chicken.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.878
It's on the bed. Go on.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.909
Go on, off you go.
Bugger off.

09:13.950 --> 09:16.168
(chicken clucking)

09:16.220 --> 09:18.040
I thought Sherlock said
he was going to send it

09:18.090 --> 09:19.819
to that petting zoo.
Oh, they said they

09:19.860 --> 09:21.054
couldn't take them
until next week.

09:21.090 --> 09:22.887
Walked into a room
the other day,

09:22.930 --> 09:24.750
this darkened room,
and he was standing in there.

09:24.790 --> 09:27.020
Pitch black, and he had one
of them perched on his shoulder.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.051
Yeah. He'd been in
there for ages.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.365
He said it was some kind of,
like, balancing exercise.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.960
He was covered in feathers.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.264
What? What?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.834
You've been drinking.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.303
Oh... Yeah, I might have,
you know,

09:40.340 --> 09:42.808
chucked a couple back at the pub
when I was going to pick

09:42.850 --> 09:44.943
my winnings up.
That was an hour ago, right?

09:44.980 --> 09:47.642
You've had a drink
more recently than that.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.079
Whiskey,
judging from your breath

09:49.120 --> 09:50.849
and that damp spot
on your shirt. I'd say sometime

09:50.890 --> 09:52.881
in the last ten minutes?
You know,

09:52.920 --> 09:54.785
there are no bars around here.
And even If there were,

09:54.820 --> 09:56.287
how-how would you have paid
for it?

09:56.320 --> 09:57.958
The mugger took all your money,
didn't he?

09:57.990 --> 10:00.094
Yep.
You and I talked about this

10:00.130 --> 10:01.927
when Sherlock said
you could stay here.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.326
You cannot drink around him.
Yeah, well, he's an addict,

10:04.370 --> 10:06.326
actually, Joan.
He's not an alcoholic.

10:06.370 --> 10:09.066
And I suppose you thought he was
drinking heroin back in London.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.807
Where did the whiskey come from?
Well, I've got a little secret
stash out in the back.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.239
I have a little shot, you know,
ifI need one.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.406
And how often is that?

10:14.440 --> 10:16.169
(stammers) Really?
Gareth.

10:16.210 --> 10:17.643
Please. Oh, come on.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.874
You obviously
don't understand

10:18.910 --> 10:20.411
what kind of
pressure I'm under.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.680
All the bloody offers...
You just have
to make a decision.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.847
It's a bit more complicated.
Is it?

10:24.890 --> 10:26.949
What, you want me
to say it to you?
Say what?

10:26.990 --> 10:28.412
Holmes was right about me!

10:28.460 --> 10:30.985
I can't...

10:31.030 --> 10:34.727
do this job without him.
I can't be a detective.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.024
You were a detective_
long before you knew hIm.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.867
Well, like, back in the day,
you know, when I was...

10:38.900 --> 10:40.197
when I was adequate,
when I was...

10:40.240 --> 10:42.959
when I was competent.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.807
Joan, these people,
they don't want...
they don't want adequate.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.000
They want special.
They want me

10:46.040 --> 10:48.099
to be the man that I
was when I was with him!

10:48.140 --> 10:50.005
You know, I know
that you have had your troubles,

10:50.050 --> 10:51.847
but you are overthinking this.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.213
That's very easy for you to say,
of course, isn't it?

10:55.250 --> 10:59.380
You know, because you're the one
that's with him now.

10:59.420 --> 11:02.309
You're the one that gets
to be special.

11:04.460 --> 11:08.123
Well, you know, just take it
from someone who's been there.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.435
Just enjoy it while it lasts.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.864
(beeping)

11:20.140 --> 11:21.937
Hey.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.106
Was that a hint
of surprise I detect?

11:23.150 --> 11:25.072
I told you
I received several of these.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.941
Well, just thought you'd be

11:26.980 --> 11:28.971
neck-deep in files
from the Sarah Cushing case.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.442
I was for most
of the evenIng.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.913
Then the captain called
and told me

11:32.960 --> 11:34.916
that the severed ears
Gordon Cushing received

11:34.960 --> 11:37.053
were a DNA match for Sarah's.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.227
You're kidding.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.296
That's me, Watson. Joke machine.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.457
So, Sarah Cushing is alive?

11:42.500 --> 11:44.889
She is, or at least
she was as of yesterday.

11:44.930 --> 11:46.989
Gordon will be paying
for her safe,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.268
if earless, return presently.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.165
The NYPD will be watching.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.768
And since they hardly need
the assistance

11:51.810 --> 11:53.437
of two consulting detectives
to execute

11:53.480 --> 11:56.108
a simple ransom exchange...

12:03.520 --> 12:05.886
Balancing exercise?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.956
How'd you...?

12:07.990 --> 12:09.480
Let's drop it.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.852
Have you seen him this morning?
I did not.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.926
I did hear him leave earlier on.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.052
This arrived for you

12:15.100 --> 12:17.091
from Detective Bell.

12:17.130 --> 12:18.927
You opened it?

12:18.970 --> 12:21.939
It's just a few files
pertaining to recent muggings.

12:21.970 --> 12:25.098
_ I'm c_urious-- since when do_we
InvestIgate common street crIme?

12:25.140 --> 12:25.936
Since when

12:25.970 --> 12:27.107
do you open my mail?

12:27.140 --> 12:28.277
How long you lived here?

12:28.310 --> 12:31.006
(groans)

12:35.280 --> 12:37.384
(indistinct
intercom announcement)

12:37.420 --> 12:39.411
GREGSON:
10:00 am. on the dot,
Mr. Cushing.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.281
Our guy should be here soon.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.789
Eyes forward.
Don't look at me.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.036
It's going down.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.367
All right, be advised.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.062
Suspect is a white male,
35 years old,

12:59.110 --> 13:02.136
wearing a blue coat
and a wool cap with sunglasses.

13:05.850 --> 13:06.874
(sniffs)

13:06.920 --> 13:08.046
Keep your phone on.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.843
One hour.
Once I know I'm clear,

13:09.890 --> 13:11.289
I'll call with your
wife's location.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.356
GREGSON:
Suspect is on the move,
heading south

13:13.390 --> 13:16.018
on the southbound platform
towards the Varick exit.

13:16.060 --> 13:19.894
Blue team, I want you
to cut him a wide berth.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.497
Are you seeing this?

13:23.530 --> 13:25.327
What is he doing?

13:25.370 --> 13:27.190
Where the hell is he going?
Backup units,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.060
be advised,
suspect is fleeing south

13:29.100 --> 13:31.534
into the southbound tunnel.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.208
Hold your positions,

13:33.240 --> 13:35.037
and we'll pick him up
as he exits.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.241
Do not attempt to follow.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.508
What do you mean?
He's gonna get away.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.245
We've got a tracer in the bag,

13:40.280 --> 13:42.168
Mr. Cushing.
Remember I showed it to you?

13:42.220 --> 13:43.312
I-I know,
but what if he finds it?

13:43.350 --> 13:45.045
What if he changes bags?

13:45.090 --> 13:46.318
He's not supposed
to be out of our sight.

13:46.350 --> 13:49.217
We've got people every
place he might pop up.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.182
Just let us do our job.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.424
No, I'm sorry.

13:52.460 --> 13:55.349
Mr. Cushing,
stay where you are!

13:55.400 --> 13:57.868
Command support, pull the box.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.061
Cut the power to the track now!

14:08.980 --> 14:10.106
Hold!

14:10.150 --> 14:11.503
Hold your fire.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.438
Mr. Cushing!

14:13.480 --> 14:15.619
Mr. Cushing.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.186
Show us your hands.

14:17.220 --> 14:20.212
I was just trying to stop him.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.478
He wouldn't listen to me.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.950
He...

14:28.000 --> 14:30.161
He wouldn't listen.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.497
I was just trying to stop him.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.205
It all happened so fast.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.047
The man who took the money,

14:48.080 --> 14:51.311
he realized I was chasing him.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.487
He came at me.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.909
And so then
you picked up the rebar?

14:54.960 --> 14:57.326
I don't even know how I...

14:57.360 --> 14:58.520
I think it was on the ground.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.427
I swung at him and Ijust...

15:01.460 --> 15:03.599
Have you been able
to identify him?

15:03.630 --> 15:06.326
BELL: _
He wasn't carryIng
any identification.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.065
All he had in his pockets
was a set of keys,

15:08.100 --> 15:09.533
some loose change.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.504
We ran his prints and DNA
through the system.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.929
So far, no hits.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.379
Well, you said yesterday

15:15.410 --> 15:16.377
he may have partners.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.547
Have you heard from them?

15:17.580 --> 15:19.571
No.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.689
But if he was working alone,
that means...

15:23.720 --> 15:26.439
there's nobody there
to take care of Sarah, right?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.651
Nobody to bring her food.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.021
Nobody to bring her water.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.051
It's a possibility.

15:32.090 --> 15:35.127
Four years I spent
trying to convince people

15:35.160 --> 15:37.560
I didn't kill her.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.092
Now maybe I finally have.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.138
(sighs)

15:50.180 --> 15:51.499
Stating the obvious here.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.211
This one's a mess.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.047
I got two severed ears,
one dead body.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.287
No leads.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.312
Question is-- is it a mess
of Mr. Cushing's design?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.681
Could be 2011 all over again.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.483
He wants people to
think he's innocent,

16:04.530 --> 16:07.124
so he hires this guy to pick
up the money this morning.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.151
Kills him to tie up loose ends.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.565
But that wouldn't
explaIn the ears.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.568
They match Sarah Cushing's DNA.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.534
If Gordon's behind everything,
that would mean that he's been

16:14.570 --> 16:16.197
keeping her somewhere
for the last four years.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.764
If that's true, then why
draw attention to himself?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.539
What would he stand to gain?

16:19.570 --> 16:22.300
Whatever the case, the dead man
represents our best chance

16:22.340 --> 16:23.602
of uncovering the truth
and getting to Sarah.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.242
So, with your blessing,

16:25.280 --> 16:27.373
Watson and I will
withdraw to the morgue

16:27.420 --> 16:28.444
and examine the body
and his personal effects.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.447
WOMAN:
Miss Watson?

16:29.480 --> 16:30.549
Yes?

16:30.590 --> 16:31.682
You have a visitor.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.310
You head to the morgue.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.509
I'll meet you there.
I thought that...

16:35.560 --> 16:36.584
It's okay, really.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.157
I'll be there as soon as I can.

16:39.190 --> 16:41.021
Thanks.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.398
Aren't you gonna offer me
a nice cup of coffee?

16:46.430 --> 16:47.692
Or some tea?

16:47.740 --> 16:48.798
(door closes)

16:48.840 --> 16:51.104
Perhaps even a donut?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.266
Well, I didn't invite you here
to feed you.

16:52.310 --> 16:53.299
No, you invited me here

16:53.340 --> 16:55.479
to ask me to leave
the brownstone.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.375
You have until the weekend.

16:57.410 --> 17:00.174
Take one of the offers,
start your new life.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.745
I bet you two...

17:02.780 --> 17:05.146
had quite a laugh last night,
didn't you,

17:05.190 --> 17:08.079
about my... my little mishap.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.123
All the things I said.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.720
Actually I didn't say
anything to Sherlock.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.149
I didn't think it was my place.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.565
But since you brought it up,

17:17.600 --> 17:19.295
I don't find
your self-pity amusing.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.469
When Detective_ Bell
was out of C0mmISSIOn,

17:21.500 --> 17:24.298
Sherlock ran
through a string of detectives.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.739
Seven of them. Good ones.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.169
Far more than adequate.

17:27.210 --> 17:28.768
But none of them
good enough for him.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.641
Or me.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.443
Yeah, well, he did the same
thing back in London, didn't he?

17:32.480 --> 17:33.572
Oh, until you.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.247
He stuck with you.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.339
He chose you.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.253
What's this?

17:45.290 --> 17:47.258
Case files
on a couple of muggings.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.461
Let's have a little look.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.867
Well, it's the same
vicinity and MO.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.730
as the little toe rag
that did me.

18:01.410 --> 18:04.379
I take it you think
that I'm the third in a string?

18:06.180 --> 18:09.217
And am I supposed to be doing
something with these?

18:09.250 --> 18:10.786
Find the guy, be a detective.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.879
At the very least,
you might get your cash back.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.115
At the most, you'll realize

18:15.160 --> 18:17.321
you were never
just someone else's tagalong.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.299
So, your friend Lestrade--

18:22.330 --> 18:24.594
looked like he had
a rough night.

18:24.630 --> 18:26.621
The calluses
on his hands indicate

18:26.670 --> 18:28.228
that our Mr. Doe did

18:28.270 --> 18:29.294
manual labor.

18:29.340 --> 18:30.534
The traces of ceramic grit

18:30.570 --> 18:33.698
under his fingernails
suggest he was a roofer.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.230
Now, this is trade notorious

18:35.280 --> 18:37.407
for its mediocre pay
and poor working conditions.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.338
It is the domain
of the illegal immigrant

18:39.380 --> 18:40.813
and the recent parolees.

18:40.850 --> 18:43.284
So, you're quite certain
that this man's prints

18:43.320 --> 18:44.787
do not match anything
on your database?

18:44.820 --> 18:46.378
Not yet.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.285
Hmm.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.810
Note these shoes.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.725
Several years old,
paper-thin soles.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.591
This does not look like a man
who's collected

18:53.630 --> 18:55.257
a seven-figure ransom

18:55.300 --> 18:56.551
three years previously

18:56.600 --> 18:59.296
and has masterminded
a follow-up.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.389
Well, perhaps,
we're looking at an errand boy.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.431
If that's the case,

19:03.470 --> 19:05.301
why haven't we heard
from his partners?

19:05.340 --> 19:08.537
"Rabkin Hardware"?

19:08.580 --> 19:10.241
Yeah, it's in Hempstead.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.872
They gave out a few
hundred of those

19:11.910 --> 19:14.413
as a promotion last year.
Tried the owner.

19:14.450 --> 19:15.519
He didn't recognize our guy.

19:15.550 --> 19:17.347
Neither did any
of his employees.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.539
Hmm.

19:18.590 --> 19:21.286
Yeah, I saw those, too.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.412
I'm not sure about the pattern.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.882
Could be some kind
of gang insignia.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.579
Yeah, more of a club really.

19:25.630 --> 19:26.585
A.A., C.A.,

19:26.630 --> 19:28.325
L.A., N.A.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.759
Pick your anonymous, hmm?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.267
The 30 represents 30 days.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.494
The six represents six months.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.191
Sobriety chips.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.435
Yeah, some people in recovery
ink themselves

19:36.470 --> 19:38.267
to commemorate
certaIn mIIestones.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.778
I, myself, find
that practice idiotic.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.505
Chips are plastic and thin
for a reason.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.371
They're fragile, easily lost.

19:44.410 --> 19:45.900
Just like the sobriety
they represent...

19:45.950 --> 19:47.838
Aanay, fortunately for us,

19:47.880 --> 19:50.519
our man's hubris
might help us identify him.

19:50.550 --> 19:53.417
Why do I get the feeling
we're about to hit up

19:53.460 --> 19:55.451
some support group
meetings in Hempstead?

19:55.490 --> 19:57.629
(grunts)

20:01.730 --> 20:02.799
Hey. How's it going?

20:02.830 --> 20:03.865
Not well.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.424
His face has yet to ring a bell.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.267
Are you all right?

20:07.300 --> 20:09.234
This was a mistake.
It was your Idea.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.500
It-it's an utter violation
of the proud traditions

20:11.540 --> 20:12.859
of these meetings.

20:12.910 --> 20:14.502
They're meant to be anonymous.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.269
And here we are, asking
these attendees

20:16.310 --> 20:17.447
to identify one of their own.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.698
Hmm, I-I-I did not
think this through.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.308
We are trying to save
a woman's life here.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.612
And so_ is Marcus
at the meetIng he went to.

20:22.650 --> 20:24.538
The people that I talk to,
they get that.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.945
I don't think you
should've interfered.

20:26.990 --> 20:29.458
With what?
With Lestrade.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.481
The files you requested,
obviously they were for him.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.327
He was the victim of a mugging.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.998
And you think that putting him
on the trail of the culprit

20:35.030 --> 20:36.895
will simultaneously solve
his crisis of confidence

20:36.930 --> 20:39.728
and drag him out of whatever
bottle he's crawled into.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.431
Wait, how did you
know about that?

20:41.470 --> 20:42.994
I have a nose, Watson.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.735
And eyes and ears.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.477
If he wasn't concerned
about hIs prospects,

20:47.510 --> 20:49.501
his stay with us would've
only lasted a few days.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.644
He's lost without me.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.477
I don't understand.
If you knew about it,

20:53.520 --> 20:55.408
why didn't you try and talk
to him, try and help him?

20:55.450 --> 20:56.474
I have been helping him.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.681
By allowing him to bottom out.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.608
I told him of my concerns
regarding his problems

21:00.660 --> 21:01.786
while you and I were in London.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.481
He chose to ignore me.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.282
He became the myrmidon
of a wealthy pervert.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.854
Shockingly that didn't turn out.

21:06.890 --> 21:10.565
So now I'm of the firm opinion
the next move should be his.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.420
Even_if _that next move
Is ImpIOSIon?

21:12.470 --> 21:13.562
I imploded. Look at me.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.659
All I did was put him on a case.
I put him

21:15.700 --> 21:17.031
on many a case when we
were in Scotland Yard.

21:17.070 --> 21:18.367
Look how that turned out.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.365
Are you saying that he shouldn't

21:19.410 --> 21:20.377
be a detective anymore?

21:20.410 --> 21:21.399
I'm saying

21:21.440 --> 21:22.236
that I believe he needs

21:22.280 --> 21:25.443
to find his way
out of this himself.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.573
The meeting's gonna start.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.814
Let's go.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.987
Hold on.
Hmm?

21:34.590 --> 21:35.989
You know that woman?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.821
I think we both do.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.336
She's had a bit
of work done, but not enough

21:47.370 --> 21:50.498
to conceal her true identity.
At least not from me.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.432
It's Sarah Cushing.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.469
Yeah.

21:54.510 --> 21:56.034
Alive.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.570
And not in the least bit
kidnapped.

21:59.380 --> 22:00.870
And if I'm not mistaken,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.741
in firm possession
of both of her ears.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.493
You're right.
I am Sarah Cushing.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.352
I was her, anyway.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.368
I go by Allison
Drake now.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.664
I have for years.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.567
Everything Gordon told
the police in 2010 was true.

22:24.940 --> 22:27.500
I packed my bags
and left with no warning.

22:27.540 --> 22:30.134
Our fights just
kept getting uglier,

22:30.180 --> 22:32.899
and even when
we weren't argumg,

22:32.950 --> 22:35.043
I'd catch him just...

22:35.080 --> 22:36.513
staring at me.

22:36.550 --> 22:38.438
The look on his face...

22:38.490 --> 22:40.856
It felt like he was
going to hurt me.

22:40.890 --> 22:42.881
You never reached out
to the po|Ice,

22:42.920 --> 22:44.751
even after they
began to suspect

22:44.790 --> 22:45.882
Gordon murdered you.

22:45.930 --> 22:47.795
Is that because you
were still scared?

22:49.100 --> 22:52.092
I thought of different
ways to come forward,

22:52.130 --> 22:53.995
but every time I got
close to doing it,

22:54.040 --> 22:56.793
I'd think of that look.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.068
I thought,

22:58.110 --> 23:00.635
Gordon's a
determIned man.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.931
If he knew I
was out there

23:01.980 --> 23:03.800
and he wanted
to find me...

23:06.850 --> 23:08.841
I made a new life
for myself out here.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.711
I got sober,

23:10.750 --> 23:12.183
married a doctor.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.653
HOLMES:
Ms. Cushing,

23:13.690 --> 23:15.851
this man...

23:15.890 --> 23:18.450
managed to convince
Gordon and the police

23:18.490 --> 23:20.185
that he'd kidnapped you.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.425
Do you recognize him?

23:23.500 --> 23:25.525
Jim Browner.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.494
I met him here,
in a meeting.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.862
Somehow he figured out
who I really was.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.730
He blackmailed me for a while.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.008
I guess

23:35.040 --> 23:36.803
he decided he could
make more money

23:36.840 --> 23:37.909
by telling Gordon
he abducted me.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.518
Jim's last
ransom letter...

23:42.550 --> 23:44.040
it contained
two human ears

23:44.090 --> 23:45.489
in the package.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.580
The DNA matched yours,
but your ears are fine.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.987
Actually, I-I think
I might be able to explain that.

23:53.030 --> 23:54.918
A few years ago,

23:54.960 --> 23:57.053
I saw a story on the news.

23:57.100 --> 24:00.490
A woman's body
turned up in a marsh.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.996
The police thought
it might be mine,

24:02.040 --> 24:04.031
so they compared
DNA from the corpse

24:04.070 --> 24:06.868
to hairs on a brush
they took out of my bathroom.

24:08.810 --> 24:10.675
Only that brush wasn't mine.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.974
I took mine with
me when I left.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.477
HOLMES:
You think your
husband was seeing

24:14.520 --> 24:16.078
someone else in 2010.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.884
I think that brush
belonged to the other woman.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.919
And those ears
Gordon received...

24:24.960 --> 24:26.757
whoever she is,

24:26.790 --> 24:28.451
they have to be hers.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.222
LESTRADE:
Mr. Roscoe Pelfrey?

24:33.270 --> 24:35.591
Hello. Yes, my name's
Gareth Lestrade.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.268
I'm a... I'm a detective.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.608
I wondered ifI might
ask you a few questions

24:40.640 --> 24:43.848
about the man that mugged you.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.006
PELFREY:
Did you get it?

24:45.050 --> 24:46.847
Did the file open up all right?

24:46.880 --> 24:49.610
Yeah, no, it's come
through fine, Mr. Pelfrey.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.618
I'm just looking
at it now, actually.

24:51.650 --> 24:52.947
It's like I told the cops:

24:55.820 --> 24:57.185
My wife's an architecture buff,

24:57.220 --> 24:59.984
so I made a video _
any tIme I saw somethIng,

25:00.030 --> 25:02.157
you know, I thought she'd like.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.067
MAN:
Everything you got!
Give up right now!

25:05.100 --> 25:06.590
Nope, never got his face.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.791
Well, fella cracked me
before I turned around.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.159
My camera fell into the gutter.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.861
That's the only reason
I got it back.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.605
Can you think of anything at all

25:13.640 --> 25:15.073
that you haven't told
the police, Mr. Pelfrey?

25:15.110 --> 25:18.045
Anything that might
help me find this man?

25:18.080 --> 25:19.809
Sorry.
Maybe you'll have better luck

25:19.850 --> 25:21.647
with the other fella
who got mugged.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.887
MAN:
I know I locked up my gallery
for the night

25:23.920 --> 25:25.080
before he got to me,

25:25.120 --> 25:27.088
but after that,
everything's fuzzy.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.714
I got quite a bad concussion
when my head hit the pavement.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.058
Well, don't worry about that,
Mr. Phillips.

25:32.090 --> 25:33.648
I think it's so admirable

25:33.700 --> 25:35.190
that you're trying
to find the man.

25:35.230 --> 25:37.767
You said you used to work
for Scotland Yard, right?

25:37.800 --> 25:38.892
Right.

25:38.930 --> 25:40.295
That sounds so interesting.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.890
Yeah, well, I suppose...
I suppose it was, really.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.635
I have to say,
I love your accent.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.103
Oh.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.904
(chuckles) Maybe we could meet
for coffee one night,

25:48.940 --> 25:50.202
talk about something
other than assault.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.071
Well, I never try to mix

25:52.110 --> 25:55.568
business with pleasure,
Mr. Phillips, um...

25:55.620 --> 25:57.747
Are you sure there's
nothing else you remember

25:57.790 --> 25:59.644
about the night of the mugging?

25:59.690 --> 26:01.908
Like I said, I was concussed.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.655
When I came to on the sidewalk,

26:03.690 --> 26:05.180
there were a couple
of Good Samaritans.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.290
And there was this yellow
bicycle chained to a tree.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.992
I thought it was a big banana.

26:11.030 --> 26:12.691
I'm sorry.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.129
Uh... sorry. Excuse me.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.058
You say...

26:16.100 --> 26:17.601
did you say a yellow bicycle?

26:17.640 --> 26:19.198
Is that right?

26:19.240 --> 26:20.309
Yes, it was garish.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.069
Big green handlebars.

26:22.110 --> 26:25.045
Can you blame me
for thinking it was a banana?

26:25.080 --> 26:28.049
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.071
Is the bicycle important?

26:30.120 --> 26:32.213
GORDON:
Sarah's alive?

26:32.250 --> 26:34.912
The ears...
they're obviously not Sarah's.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.211
How did they match her DNA?

26:36.260 --> 26:38.956
She believes that the hairbrush

26:38.990 --> 26:40.753
the police took for a DNA sample

26:40.800 --> 26:43.621
belonged to another woman.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.093
Perhaps a visitor
to your bedroom?

26:46.130 --> 26:48.132
Is that possible?

26:49.270 --> 26:50.737
Yes.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.203
When things got truly
miserable between us,

26:52.240 --> 26:53.229
I started seeing

26:53.270 --> 26:54.703
someone else.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.071
You need to tell
us about her.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.338
I... know less about her

26:57.380 --> 26:58.938
than you'd probably like.

26:58.980 --> 27:00.345
It was a professional
engagement.

27:01.980 --> 27:03.208
was Kendra.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.649
That was all I was ever given.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.339
She was blonde,
just like Sarah was back then,

27:06.390 --> 27:08.119
so I suppose the police

27:08.160 --> 27:09.957
could've mistaken
her brush for Sarah's.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.981
We're gonna need
her contact info.

27:12.030 --> 27:14.055
I can give you the name of the
agency that referred her to me,

27:14.100 --> 27:15.294
but I don't think
you're gonna have any luck.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.218
When Sarah
disappeared

27:17.260 --> 27:18.818
and I was named
a suspect,

27:18.870 --> 27:20.792
Kendra got frightened.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.034
Stopped seeing me.

27:22.070 --> 27:23.139
Changed all of her numbers.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.762
My contact at her agency

27:24.810 --> 27:25.936
said that she disappeared

27:25.970 --> 27:28.768
every bit as thoroughly
as Sarah did.

27:28.810 --> 27:30.778
Do you think Sarah

27:30.810 --> 27:33.005
is behind whatever's
happened to Kendra?

27:33.050 --> 27:36.019
When I told you the other day

27:36.050 --> 27:39.679
that I never lied
to the police, I meant it.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.688
When I said I spoke to Sarah

27:41.720 --> 27:43.187
on the phone in 2011...

27:43.220 --> 27:44.824
You meant that, too.
YouTe
referrIng

27:44.860 --> 27:46.350
to the original
ransom demand.

27:48.230 --> 27:49.993
She was in on it.

27:50.030 --> 27:51.327
She had to be.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.691
And if she was
part of it then,

27:53.740 --> 27:56.061
she's part of it now.

27:59.070 --> 28:01.004
FEMALE REPORTER:
Friends and family
are still reeling

28:01.040 --> 28:03.031
at the news that Sarah Cushing
has turned up

28:03.080 --> 28:05.378
alive and well on Long Island.

28:05.410 --> 28:08.049
Her appearance
has changed since 2010.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.877
And there are_ rumors
that's compIIments

28:09.920 --> 28:12.047
of the man she married in 2012,

28:12.090 --> 28:14.115
plastic surgeon
Dr. Steven Edelman.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.720
Those rumors
have yet to be conﬁrmed.

28:16.760 --> 28:17.988
MALE REPORTER:
Thank you, Toni.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.054
How long
does it take

28:19.090 --> 28:20.796
to identify a
bloody prostitute?

28:20.830 --> 28:23.128
Well, Marcus said he was
going to call in an hour.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.764
It's been... 45 minutes.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.199
To be fair,
he only has a first name

28:26.230 --> 28:27.424
and a hair color.

28:27.470 --> 28:29.097
Luxury.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.869
I'll name that tart
in 20 keystrokes.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.404
So you think that
Gordon is right.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.374
You think that Sarah
is behind everything.

28:37.410 --> 28:38.809
(sighs)

28:38.850 --> 28:40.078
Let's say she
took advantage

28:40.110 --> 28:41.941
of his predicament
in 2011.

28:41.980 --> 28:44.483
If she did, she successfully
extracted $1 million.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.987
Cut to the present day.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.442
She wants a
second go-round.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.957
But she knows that
Gordon won't just

28:48.990 --> 28:49.979
hand over the money
a second time.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.248
He'll go to the police.

28:51.290 --> 28:53.121
She knows the truth

28:53.160 --> 28:54.388
_ about _the hairbrush
In the po|Ice's posseSSIon.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.160
So she tracks down Kendra

28:58.200 --> 29:00.065
_and she sends him
a paIr of ears that WIll match.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.431
Genetically, at least.

29:01.470 --> 29:04.007
Or he lied about
getting that call in 2011,

29:04.040 --> 29:05.860
and now that he knows
that Sarah's alive,

29:05.910 --> 29:07.104
he's trying to get back at her

29:07.140 --> 29:08.175
for all the hell
she put him through.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.529
Hmm.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.138
In any case,

29:11.180 --> 29:13.375
if we can determine
where Kendra was taken from,

29:13.410 --> 29:16.311
we may find clues to
the identity of her abductor.

29:16.350 --> 29:19.080
Hmm.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.054
Have you heard
from Lestrade today?

29:21.090 --> 29:24.025
Oh, perhaps he's finally
found his way to the gutter.

29:24.060 --> 29:27.029
If he has, the work to rebuild
him can begin in earnest.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.220
Have you done as I requested?

29:28.260 --> 29:29.488
You left him alone?

29:29.530 --> 29:31.020
I...
(phone ringing)

29:31.070 --> 29:32.264
It's Marcus.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.392
Hello?

29:33.430 --> 29:34.863
BELL:
Hey.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.094
The escort service Cushing used

29:36.140 --> 29:38.108
doesn't exist anymore.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.029
But a friend of mine from Vice
was able to put me In touch

29:41.080 --> 29:43.207
with one of the girls
Kendra used to work with.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.446
And...?

29:44.480 --> 29:45.504
Kendra's real name

29:45.550 --> 29:47.108
was Kelly Tasker.

29:47.150 --> 29:48.515
Em
phasis on "
was."

29:48.550 --> 29:51.144
She died in a car wreck
three years ago.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.282
And she was cremated.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.459
So I don't know whose ears

29:54.490 --> 29:56.287
Gordon Cushing got
in the mail the other day,

29:56.320 --> 29:58.151
but they weren't hers.

29:58.190 --> 29:59.225
(sighs)

30:05.270 --> 30:07.465
WATSON:
Oh. You're still up.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.536
Gordon Cushing
received a pair of
freshly severed ears

30:09.570 --> 30:11.458
in the mail
two days ago.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.307
They were a DNA match for hairs

30:13.340 --> 30:15.501
taken from a brush believed
to belong to Sarah Cushing.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.178
Only the brush wasn't hers.

30:17.210 --> 30:19.303
Gordon says it could only
belong to Kelly Tasker,

30:19.350 --> 30:21.215
aka Kendra,

30:21.250 --> 30:22.376
only she's been dead for years.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.615
Obviously,
the ears weren't hers.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.208
So the question remains:

30:26.250 --> 30:27.979
Whose ears were they?

30:28.020 --> 30:30.215
When I went to bed,
you were working upstairs,

30:30.260 --> 30:31.887
and now you are
camped out down here

30:31.930 --> 30:33.454
right next to the guest room.

30:33.490 --> 30:36.152
Any chance it's because
you're worried about Gareth?

30:36.200 --> 30:37.497
I'm here, Watson,
because this is where

30:37.530 --> 30:39.259
we keep the food,
and I'm hungry.

30:41.070 --> 30:42.264
You're not eating.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.130
I'm awaiting
a breakthrough.

30:43.170 --> 30:45.604
Once I have one,
I shall eat that banana.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.205
I've been thinking
about what you said.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.175
About leaving
him alone.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.212
I get it.
Sort of.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.548
I mean, I have to think
that there are better ways

30:56.580 --> 30:58.639
of helping him out than
letting him bottom out.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.487
As I already
pointed out...

31:00.520 --> 31:02.181
Yes, you bottomed out.
I know.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.120
But he is not you.
He is your friend.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.422
And I don't think
you should be afraid

31:05.460 --> 31:07.018
of helping him.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.188
(chuckles) New suspect?

31:14.240 --> 31:16.629
His name...

31:16.670 --> 31:18.467
was Alphonse Bertillon,

31:18.510 --> 31:20.364
and he invented the mug shot.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.238
He was French,
a policeman.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.373
He grew frustrated
that there was no system

31:25.410 --> 31:26.479
by which he and his colleagues

31:26.510 --> 31:28.148
could identify
captured criminals

31:28.180 --> 31:30.114
they had arrested before.

31:30.150 --> 31:31.640
So he devised one.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.682
He began cataloguing them
by their physical features,

31:34.720 --> 31:37.018
and he soon noticed
somethIng quIte unusual

31:37.060 --> 31:38.357
about the human ear.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.358
No two are alike.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.153
They are as unique
as fingerprints.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.293
This is why mug shots
are taken in profile.

31:44.330 --> 31:45.968
He believed it crucial
to capture

31:46.000 --> 31:47.968
a full view of the ear.
Hmm.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.399
That's very
interesting.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.691
Why is his
picture here?

31:50.740 --> 31:52.503
Because this case
has forced me to confront

31:52.540 --> 31:54.269
the possibility
that he was wrong.

31:57.640 --> 32:01.041
Note the lobes,
the thickness of the helices,

32:01.080 --> 32:03.241
the depth of the conchae.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.588
Mmm, they're identical.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.281
Mm-hmm. And yet
Monsieur Bertillon

32:10.320 --> 32:11.685
would tell us that's impossible.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.528
Okay, let's say you're right
about Sarah.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.255
Let's say she is
behind everything.

32:16.300 --> 32:19.394
She found someone who had ears
that looked like hers.

32:19.430 --> 32:20.624
She kidnapped that person,

32:20.670 --> 32:23.230
and then she sent her ears
to Gordon.

32:23.270 --> 32:27.161
Can you imagine the time and
effort it would take one person

32:27.210 --> 32:29.405
to find his or her ear twin?

32:29.440 --> 32:31.305
Assuming such a thing
even exists?

32:31.350 --> 32:33.272
Okay, let's say she did.
It still
wouldn't explain

32:33.310 --> 32:36.074
how that person's DNA
could work its way onto a brush

32:36.120 --> 32:39.385
recovered from a crime scene
In 2010.

32:48.530 --> 32:51.328
The news report
we watched earlier,

32:51.370 --> 32:53.463
it said that Sarah's new husband
was a plastIc surgeon,

32:53.500 --> 32:55.092
did it not?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.368
Yes. Why?

33:12.090 --> 33:15.480
LESTRADE:
There once was a man
named Shawn Menck.

33:15.520 --> 33:19.024
His home smelled so bad
it done stank.

33:19.060 --> 33:21.051
He rode on his bike,
he took what he liked,

33:21.100 --> 33:24.194
and his head was thick
as a plank.

33:24.230 --> 33:26.425
Now, that is how long
I've been sitting here

33:26.470 --> 33:28.131
waiting for you, Shawnee,
to come home.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.467
Enough time to write a limerick.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.036
I don't know who you are,

33:31.070 --> 33:32.606
but you got
about five seconds...

33:32.640 --> 33:35.336
Do you have any earthly idea,
mate, how ugly your bicycle is?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.769
I mean,
it's ridiculous.

33:37.810 --> 33:39.277
I only showed the picture

33:39.310 --> 33:40.607
to ten people
in this neighborhood

33:40.650 --> 33:42.470
before I traced it back to you.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.408
Now, you work for the local
Indian restaurant

33:44.450 --> 33:45.542
arou_nd the_cor_ner
makIng deIIverIes.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.114
When you make those deliveries,

33:47.150 --> 33:49.380
you mug people.
Now, how do I know this?

33:49.420 --> 33:53.481
Your ugly bicycle was seen at
the scene of two of the crimes.

33:53.530 --> 33:55.623
Now, I didn't notice it
when you mugged me, of course,

33:55.660 --> 33:57.696
'cause quite frankly,
well, I was in my cups.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.095
Listen, man...

33:59.130 --> 34:00.358
All three robberies
occurred

34:00.400 --> 34:01.435
inside the delivery radius

34:01.470 --> 34:03.335
and when you were on a shift.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.429
And not only that--

34:05.470 --> 34:07.358
I mean, I discovered
when I broke in here,

34:07.410 --> 34:10.129
mounds of evidence,
including my very own wallet.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.444
You know, I found
the whole experience

34:12.480 --> 34:14.311
completely underwhelming.
I mean...

34:14.350 --> 34:15.772
I thought there'd be
a bit more cloak-and-dagger,

34:15.820 --> 34:17.845
a bit more thrill of the chase,
but no, no.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.518
In fact, I'm actually
more depressed now

34:19.550 --> 34:20.778
than I was when I first started.

34:20.820 --> 34:22.515
So, now, what I'm

34:22.560 --> 34:24.824
gonna ask you for,
Shawnee, is, uh...

34:24.860 --> 34:27.249
is for my money back.

34:27.290 --> 34:30.453
So I can leave here
and I can go to the pub

34:30.500 --> 34:34.129
and buy myself
a nice, refreshing pint.

34:36.670 --> 34:40.436
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, don't do that.

34:40.470 --> 34:43.268
No creeping up on me
this time, mate.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.468
Really?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.442
Come on.

34:54.890 --> 34:56.448
(sighs)

35:15.540 --> 35:17.679
We appreciate you coming in.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.439
Of course.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.675
You said on the phone
you had some questions?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.779
Uh, we do.
First among them,

35:23.820 --> 35:25.310
would you be so kind

35:25.350 --> 35:28.285
as to stand up and,
uh, touch your toes?

35:28.320 --> 35:30.857
A simple enough command,

35:30.890 --> 35:33.484
and yet it confounds you.
Very well. Question number two:

35:33.530 --> 35:35.555
Can we take a look at your bag?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.625
I don't know
what's going on here,

35:37.660 --> 35:39.321
but I don't think
this is very funny.

35:39.370 --> 35:41.463
WATSON: You don't want us
to see your bag, because then

35:41.500 --> 35:42.865
we would see the
surgIcal scars.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.606
HOLMES:
That's why you've been
sitting with your back

35:44.640 --> 35:45.709
so straight, isn't it?

35:45.740 --> 35:46.604
The tissue's still healing,

35:46.640 --> 35:48.301
and you do not wish
to agitate it.

35:48.340 --> 35:51.377
I had some cancer removed
a few days ago.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.571
WATSON:
Let me guess.
Two growths...

35:55.380 --> 35:57.348
Looked a lot like these?

35:57.380 --> 35:58.711
I don't know...

35:58.750 --> 36:00.547
HOLMES:
Last night,
I was wondering

36:00.590 --> 36:03.514
how those ears could be
a genetIc match for strands

36:03.560 --> 36:05.949
of hair on a brush taken
from your bathroom.

36:05.990 --> 36:07.457
You said the brush
was not yours.

36:07.490 --> 36:10.698
And yet those ears,
identical to your own,

36:10.730 --> 36:12.721
and as I've already said,
the DNA's a match.

36:12.770 --> 36:15.933
Then it occurred to me,
you lied when you said

36:15.970 --> 36:18.404
the brush belonged
to someone else. It was yours.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.637
GREGSON:
The ears are yours,
too, right?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.432
It's just they didn't come
from your head.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.448
You realize how crazy
this all sounds?

36:27.480 --> 36:28.777
People thought
Dr. Charles Vacanti was crazy

36:28.820 --> 36:30.640
when he grew what looked like
a human ear

36:30.680 --> 36:32.545
on the back of a lab mouse
in 1997.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.455
I, myself, did not.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.481
WATSON:
Ears are mostly
cartilage, which means

36:36.520 --> 36:39.523
they're very difficult
to repair once damaged.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.551
They also have
a very complicated shape.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.626
HOLMES:
Dr. Vacanti devised a method
for growing human cartilage

36:44.670 --> 36:46.626
on a biodegradable
ear-shaped scaffold.

36:46.670 --> 36:49.468
You place the scaffold
beneath the subject's skin,

36:49.500 --> 36:50.967
and it dissolves over time,

36:51.000 --> 36:52.501
leaving nothing
but the cartilage.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.508
If you're not familiar
with the process,

36:54.540 --> 36:56.371
I encourage you to bend
your husband's ear.

36:56.410 --> 36:58.469
WATSON:
Not only is he
a plastic surgeon;

36:58.510 --> 37:00.444
he's done this kind
of work before. We checked.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.744
He built two scaffolds that
looked just like your ears,

37:02.780 --> 37:04.486
and then planted them
in your back.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.488
GREGSON:
Three days ago,
he cut them off

37:06.520 --> 37:08.556
and he sent them
to your ex.

37:08.590 --> 37:10.649
After that, it was a matter
of collecting the ransom.

37:10.690 --> 37:13.454
A task for which you recruited
the late Jim Browner.

37:13.490 --> 37:15.424
He didn't figure out
who you were.

37:15.460 --> 37:17.553
You told him when you made him
your accomplice.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.819
This is a court order
to collect a DNA sample

37:20.870 --> 37:22.861
to compare to the ears
in the box.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.504
One way or the other,

37:24.540 --> 37:26.758
we're gonna prove
they came from you.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.878
(ringtone plays)

37:45.590 --> 37:47.683
Lestrade?
Yes.
What's going on?

37:47.730 --> 37:49.493
LESTRADE:
Sherlock, Joan.

37:53.770 --> 37:56.796
Please, sir,
take a seat.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.471
Now, first off,
I want you to know

38:04.510 --> 38:05.943
that there's no
hard feelings.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.778
I know that you tried
to put one over on me.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.846
And I know it was done
with the best intentions.

38:11.890 --> 38:16.884
Right. So, I captured
Shawn Menck today.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.418
He was the man
that robbed me.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.052
Oh, that's
fantastic, Gareth.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.364
Yeah, well, it
would have been

38:24.400 --> 38:27.528
had he not been handed to
me on a SI|ver platter.

38:27.570 --> 38:31.506
Yeah. I spoke to his two
other victims today--

38:31.540 --> 38:33.030
Mr. Pelfrey,
Mr. Phillips--

38:33.070 --> 38:34.628
and they, you'll
be shocked to hear,

38:34.680 --> 38:37.604
were actually
extremely helpful.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.643
Miraculously so, really.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.688
Yes, you got to
these files first,

38:46.720 --> 38:48.915
didn't you,
Sherlock, hmm?

38:48.960 --> 38:50.882
You figured out the
bit about the bike.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.922
And then you doctored
these files

38:52.960 --> 38:54.848
so when I called
Pelfrey and Phillips,

38:54.900 --> 38:57.528
I was in_fact
caIIIng you Instead.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.822
What is he talking about?

38:58.870 --> 39:00.599
Oh, you know, Joan,
you can, you know,

39:00.630 --> 39:02.837
drop the act now.
What act?

39:02.870 --> 39:03.962
You really don't know, do you?
Know what?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.558
Well, your partner here

39:05.610 --> 39:07.464
decided to give me
a shot in the arm.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.034
He'd get me back
on the horse.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.140
He spoon-fed me the clues
so I could find Menck.

39:12.180 --> 39:14.910
Gareth, those files
were my idea. He didn't even...

39:14.950 --> 39:17.077
You don't know him
like I know him.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.680
In fact, you don't know
how well he knows you.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.781
You and your
voices, Sherlock.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.981
I don't know who I
preferred more, actually,

39:26.030 --> 39:27.429
Pelfrey or Phillips.

39:27.460 --> 39:29.758
Though I have to say
that asking me out

39:29.800 --> 39:31.825
for a cup of coffee
was a really nice touch.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.792
I was actually quite
flattered, to be honest.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.798
You should have seen
me there, though,

39:35.840 --> 39:37.592
sitting there,
Shawn Menck's apartment.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.131
I just couldn't believe
how easy it was

39:40.170 --> 39:42.070
to find all of
that evidence.

39:42.110 --> 39:44.135
Three of the wallets
sitting neatly stacked

39:44.180 --> 39:45.841
on a little table.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.643
I thought it was
impossible.

39:47.680 --> 39:51.480
But then... just as
I was about to leave,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.614
I found this.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.389
Yes.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.122
It's a rooster feather.

39:59.160 --> 40:02.197
Just like the ones
on your pets.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.460
You'd set the table for me,
hadn't you, Sherlock?

40:04.500 --> 40:06.627
But you just done too good
a job of it.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.126
You see, if I hadn't found this,

40:08.170 --> 40:10.138
_ I'd still be out
mopIng around thIs brownstone

40:10.170 --> 40:13.207
with a right old
bog on. But no,

40:13.240 --> 40:14.832
thanks to seeing
through a plot devised

40:14.880 --> 40:17.178
by the great Sherlock Holmes,
I have decided

40:17.210 --> 40:19.644
to give detecting
one last chance.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.568
So I accepted a
job this morning.

40:21.620 --> 40:25.738
Yeah, it's a consultant
position with the Garda in Cork.

40:25.790 --> 40:29.055
Wait-- the Garda, as in
the Irish National Police?

40:29.090 --> 40:30.648
Yes, that's right.
I leave tomorrow.

40:30.690 --> 40:32.749
So I've got rather a
lot of packing to do.

40:32.790 --> 40:34.155
So if you'll excuse me.

40:34.190 --> 40:35.851
Unless, of course,
you want to continue

40:35.900 --> 40:37.151
this ridiculous charade,
Sherlock,

40:37.200 --> 40:39.964
I will quite happily stay.

40:52.710 --> 40:55.543
Well played, sir.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.969
Well played.

41:02.890 --> 41:04.778
Well...

41:08.060 --> 41:10.620
Now... I wouldn't

41:10.660 --> 41:12.867
feel too bad about
him leaving you

41:12.900 --> 41:14.663
in the dark, Joan.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.258
I mean, you have to
understand, of course,

41:16.300 --> 41:19.758
you are in the infancy
of your partnership.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.608
Having spent as much
time as I did with him,

41:22.640 --> 41:24.972
you'll figure
him out as well.

41:32.220 --> 41:33.778
(beeping)

41:35.320 --> 41:37.151
to help him
these last couple of days,

41:37.190 --> 41:39.784
because you had your own plan
to build him up?

41:39.830 --> 41:41.695
I've never heard
of Shawn Menck,

41:41.730 --> 41:43.994
Roscoe Pelfrey or
Carlton Phillips.

41:44.030 --> 41:46.965
I did not manipulate
those files.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.661
However easy it may have been,

41:48.700 --> 41:50.895
Lestrade closed that case
on hIs own.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.703
The conspiracy he's describing

41:52.740 --> 41:55.903
is a product of his obviously
very fertile imagination.

41:55.940 --> 41:58.135
As far as the feather
that he found,

41:58.180 --> 42:00.000
that's a classic case
of transference.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.746
It fell from his clothes,
not mine.

42:02.780 --> 42:04.179
But you just said...

42:04.220 --> 42:06.643
What I thought would be
most helpful to him.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.248
You were right.

42:08.290 --> 42:10.952
And the more he talked,
the clearer it became.

42:10.990 --> 42:12.321
In some cases,

42:12.360 --> 42:15.523
there are other ways
to assist a friend.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.667
So what does that one do
once it ticks down?

42:20.700 --> 42:24.261
Spray you with water,
make a loud noise?

42:24.300 --> 42:25.904
It explodes.

42:25.940 --> 42:27.134
I told my colleague
I wanted more

42:27.170 --> 42:28.535
of a challenge,
and he sent me this.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.102
Oh.

42:33.150 --> 42:35.243
You're staying?

42:35.280 --> 42:38.716
Mmm, what can I say?
I have faith.
