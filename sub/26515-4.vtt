[Dick]
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.720 --> 00:23.190
Welcome home, Rachel.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.260
When she was brought to us,

00:24.290 --> 00:26.260
Rachel was hiding
from her father.

00:26.290 --> 00:29.260
Truth is, we should
never have let you go.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.000
<i>-I'm, uh, Gar.
</i> <i>-I'm Rachel.</i>

00:31.030 --> 00:32.400
-I like your hair.
-Your hair is cool.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.070
That cop you told me about,
he's not your father, is he?

00:35.100 --> 00:36.340
[Rachel]<i>No, no.</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:37.770
Can you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

00:37.800 --> 00:38.970
-You left me.
-Rachel--

00:39.010 --> 00:40.870
[demonic voice] Stop lying!

00:40.910 --> 00:42.610
[car alarms blaring]

00:42.640 --> 00:44.450
[normal voice]
I need to go back
to the Sisters!

00:44.480 --> 00:46.750
[Dick]<i>How long you been
</i> <i>looking for Rachel?
[Kory]</i> <i>Few months, I thought.</i>

00:46.780 --> 00:48.480
<i>Seems like a lot longer
</i> <i>than a few months.</i>

00:48.520 --> 00:49.980
[Kory]<i>I think
</i> <i>she's part of a prophecy.</i>

00:50.020 --> 00:54.120
[Sister Catherine]<i>I promised
</i> <i>you'd be safe here, didn't I?</i>

00:54.150 --> 00:57.060
<i>They thought
</i> <i>they could protect you.</i>

00:57.090 --> 00:58.490
<i>Let me in.</i>

00:58.520 --> 00:59.490
[screaming]

00:59.530 --> 01:04.030
She's the Destroyer of Worlds.

Please! Don't leave me alone!

Please! No...

[monitor continues beeping]

02:11.700 --> 02:12.600
Hello?

02:34.890 --> 02:36.690
Hello?

02:36.720 --> 02:38.520
[Gar] Hello?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.580
[man] Yes, yes.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.040
Fascinating.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.880
We don't have much time,
but I can save you.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.610
It's okay, my boy.

03:19.130 --> 03:23.170

04:26.330 --> 04:27.380
[gasps]

04:31.470 --> 04:33.110
How... How'd you--

04:33.140 --> 04:37.040
Don't worry. I don't bite.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.580
Well, come on.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.620
[indistinct radio chatter]

05:00.430 --> 05:02.680
[officer] Okay.

05:07.810 --> 05:09.680
[Dick]
She must've lost control.

05:09.710 --> 05:14.210
[Kory] Maybe she's still here.

05:18.890 --> 05:21.320
Hey, where's Rachel?
Is she okay?

05:21.350 --> 05:24.660
-She left. Ran.
-What happened? Huh?

05:24.690 --> 05:26.360
We just wanted
to keep her here.

05:26.390 --> 05:27.860
Keep her safe, that's all.

05:27.890 --> 05:32.030
Where no one could hurt her
and she couldn't hurt anyone.

05:32.070 --> 05:34.230
-There's no stopping it now.
-Stopping what?

05:34.270 --> 05:36.070
There's no stopping it now.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.370
Oh, God. God, forgive me.

05:39.410 --> 05:40.540
God, forgive us all.

05:40.570 --> 05:43.040
Why did you leave her here?

05:43.080 --> 05:45.810
In a convent full of nuns?
Yeah, seemed real dangerous.

05:45.850 --> 05:47.750
You know, you're the one
who stole my car
and drove off.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.520
Yeah, I thought
you could handle her
for a few minutes,

05:49.550 --> 05:53.850
but I should've known better
considering you ditched her
in DC.

05:53.890 --> 05:55.420
I didn't mean to ditch her,
okay? I was trying to--

05:55.460 --> 05:58.160
You just couldn't handle her,
so you left her
with your friends.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.330
It's pathetic.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.200
Look, can we argue about this
after we find her, okay?

06:04.230 --> 06:05.700
She's getting more powerful.

06:05.730 --> 06:10.730
Yeah, but she's still a kid.
Alone and scared
and on the run.

06:15.270 --> 06:17.540
[Gar]
It's not too far from here.

06:17.580 --> 06:19.550
We'll just warm up for a bit.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.510
What's not far from here?

06:21.550 --> 06:23.120
Where are we going?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.850
Someplace you can chill.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.790
I can't chill.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.990
You don't understand...

06:29.020 --> 06:32.360
I'm changing,
and I can feel it.

06:32.390 --> 06:34.790
And it's getting worse.

06:34.830 --> 06:38.830
Well, no worse
than the crew
I live with. Trust me.

06:38.870 --> 06:42.070
We're, uh... special, too.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.340
I'm not special.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.740
I'm dangerous.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.540
You saw
what I did back there. I--

06:47.570 --> 06:52.570
And you saw
what I did back there.

06:53.350 --> 06:56.120
You're not
scared of me, right?

06:56.150 --> 07:00.620
No. No.
I blew the roof off a church.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.790
And you're still
helping me, so...

07:03.820 --> 07:08.020
I got green hair. [chuckles]

07:09.830 --> 07:11.530
Freaks all around, I guess.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.910
[gunshot]

07:26.750 --> 07:29.250
Are we outta the huntin' zone?

07:29.280 --> 07:31.880
No.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.450
Yeah.

07:33.490 --> 07:36.520
Hell, I don't know.
What's the difference?

07:36.560 --> 07:38.190
[chuckles]

07:38.220 --> 07:40.490
Man, that was a shit shot.

07:40.530 --> 07:43.460
-Well, you missed altogether.
-[scoffs]

07:43.500 --> 07:46.370
Well, I won't miss this one.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.600
Leave it alone.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.440
What the hell?

07:49.470 --> 07:50.740
Where'd you come from?

07:50.770 --> 07:51.870
Leave it alone.

07:51.910 --> 07:54.640
[chuckles] Go home, girl.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.780
Go on. Get!

07:56.810 --> 07:59.810
[Beast Boy growling]

-[gunshot]
-[groans]

08:08.490 --> 08:10.120
-You shot me!
-Get outta here!

08:10.160 --> 08:12.710
[Beast Boy roars]

08:15.230 --> 08:19.830
[Beast Boy grunting]

08:19.870 --> 08:21.100
Hey.

08:21.130 --> 08:24.740
Hey. Hey... Hey...

08:24.770 --> 08:28.610
[Rachel shushing]

08:28.640 --> 08:33.410
[Gar] Hey, uh...
Don't look, yeah?

08:33.450 --> 08:35.820
I know you're scared.

08:35.850 --> 08:40.350
I'm sorry
they did this to you.

08:40.390 --> 08:43.790
I should've done
more than roar.

08:43.820 --> 08:47.760
The truth is,
I've never bitten
anybody before.

08:47.790 --> 08:50.940
Blood grosses me out.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.200
It's dead.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.270
You okay?

09:00.310 --> 09:03.910
[Rachel sobbing quietly]

09:06.150 --> 09:10.620
I'm sorry.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.620
Rachel,

09:12.650 --> 09:16.120
there is nothing
evil about you.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.290
Nothing at all.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.690
You don't know that.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.860
Yeah, I do.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.900
I have a pretty good instinct
about this kind of thing.

09:25.930 --> 09:27.130
Come on.

09:50.990 --> 09:54.230
Whoa.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.400
You live there?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.630
Come on.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.640
-We're going down here?
-Oh, yeah.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.530
Cool, huh? Come on.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.950
[softly] Go ahead.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.800
So, what is this place?

10:28.830 --> 10:30.460
I call it...

10:30.500 --> 10:31.800
Nirvana.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.100
-[arcade music playing]
-[video game voice]<i>Bonus!</i>

10:33.130 --> 10:34.630
Holy shit.

10:34.670 --> 10:37.000
You want a pop?
I got everything.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.240
Root beer?
Orange Crush? Grape Crush?

10:40.270 --> 10:41.710
Grape.

10:41.740 --> 10:46.390
[pop music
playing on speakers]

10:46.910 --> 10:50.220
That's an original.
1948. You ever see it?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.850
Aren't you a little young
to be watching
something so old?

10:52.890 --> 10:54.450
You mean "classic."

10:54.490 --> 10:58.120
I've got every
<i>Abbott and Costello
</i> <i>Meet a Monster.</i>

10:58.160 --> 11:00.190
Yeah,
you're a geek, aren't ya?

11:00.230 --> 11:03.560
About classic films,
vinyl, and video games,

11:03.600 --> 11:05.400
yeah, check, check, and check.

11:05.430 --> 11:10.040
-So where'd you get
all this stuff?
-Uh, you know. Around.

11:10.070 --> 11:14.420
It's, uh, vintage. [chuckles]

11:15.440 --> 11:16.740
[Gar chuckles]

11:16.780 --> 11:19.210
I don't get out that much.

11:19.240 --> 11:19.990
Yeah.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.750
Yeah, they, uh... They died.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.920
My mom died, too.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.630
She was all I had.

11:31.660 --> 11:34.930
So, who were the people
you were with
at the roller rink?

11:34.960 --> 11:38.730
Oh, you know, just people.

11:38.760 --> 11:43.540
So, if your parents
are gone, um...

11:43.570 --> 11:45.210
who lives here?

11:45.240 --> 11:49.140
That is a complicated answer.

11:49.170 --> 11:50.740
[man] Gar!

11:50.780 --> 11:52.280
Uh-oh.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.750
-Who is that?
-Uh, the complicated answer.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.750
-Gar! You down there?
-Uh, you need to hide.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.420
Hide? From what?

11:58.450 --> 12:01.150
Just hide... Please.

12:01.190 --> 12:04.590
[heavy footsteps approaching]

12:04.620 --> 12:05.790
[man] Hey, Gar!

12:05.830 --> 12:10.100
[loud music playing
in headphones]

12:10.130 --> 12:12.100
Gar!

12:12.130 --> 12:13.630
Oh.

12:13.670 --> 12:15.900
-Hey, Cliff. What's up, dude?
-Who are you talking to?

12:15.940 --> 12:18.640
Uh... myself.

12:18.670 --> 12:19.840
Come on, Gar.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.970
You beat<i>Super Mario World,
you can beat this.</i>

12:22.010 --> 12:24.240
[Cliff] Oh.
Where were you today?

12:24.280 --> 12:25.180
Down here. Duh.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.780
Bullshit.
You went to town again.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.320
[clears throat]

12:29.350 --> 12:32.420
Look, my controller broke
and I had to go
get a new one. Okay?

12:32.450 --> 12:34.920
I knew I could
get there and back
before Chief came home.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.620
Oh, shit. Kid!

12:36.660 --> 12:38.060
Relax.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.460
No one followed me.

12:40.490 --> 12:41.700
Kept a low profile.

12:41.730 --> 12:45.730
[Cliff] You want
to keep a low profile,
you wear a hat.

12:45.770 --> 12:47.130
Ha, funny!

12:47.170 --> 12:50.500
You know, that's a good joke.
I heard another good joke.

12:50.540 --> 12:53.070
Why was the robot mad?

12:53.110 --> 12:55.010
'Cause someone
kept pushing his buttons.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.640
[Cliff laughs sarcastically]

12:56.680 --> 13:00.310
Keep pushing 'em, there'll be
a green tiger-skin rug
in my bedroom.

13:00.350 --> 13:03.850
Dinner. One hour.
Come tell Larry
what you want, brat.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.190
Okay. I'll be up in a minute.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.890
[Cliff] I was not
put on this Earth to babysit.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.520
[door opens]

13:11.560 --> 13:14.560
[door closes]

13:14.590 --> 13:18.030
[Gar sighs]

13:18.060 --> 13:22.570
That was close. Two players?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.040
Gotcha!

13:24.070 --> 13:26.710
Come on, Cliff.
It's all right, man.
She's cool.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.310
I know,

13:28.340 --> 13:31.140
and she listens
to all the right music,
and she's just awesome.

13:31.180 --> 13:35.650
-And make her go.
-What is this place?
Who are you people?

13:35.680 --> 13:39.420
[Gar] Chief calls us
"the conventionally
challenged."

13:39.450 --> 13:40.590
And this place is--

13:40.620 --> 13:42.360
You need to go home, kid.

13:42.390 --> 13:45.590
[stuttering]
Are you a robot? Or...

13:45.620 --> 13:47.630
[sighs] Here we go.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.790
He's a robotman.

13:48.830 --> 13:51.960
Oh, fuck me.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.330
Cliff was a race car driver.

13:54.370 --> 13:56.900
A pretty famous one, too.
He got into a bad accident.

13:56.940 --> 13:59.310
His body
was pretty much kaput.

13:59.340 --> 14:01.140
Chief managed
to save his brain.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.480
[knocking on head]

14:02.510 --> 14:05.610
-Knock it off.
-What little
there was left of it.

14:05.650 --> 14:09.020
Hey. She's gotta go
before the Chief gets home.

14:09.050 --> 14:11.450
Who's the Chief?

14:11.480 --> 14:15.790
Well, he's the greatest doctor
in the world.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.860
Saved all of us.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.830
All of you?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.130
Who else lives here?

14:22.160 --> 14:25.060
-[Cliff groans]
-Well, there's--

14:25.100 --> 14:27.870
You do realize
this is supposed to be
a secret, right?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.240
No, no.
Let me get this straight.

14:29.270 --> 14:32.640
You want the Chief,
who just learned
to walk again,

14:32.670 --> 14:35.510
to walk into your dumbassery.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.040
I thought
maybe Chief could help her.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.450
[Cliff] Ooh, you hate her
that much?

14:42.480 --> 14:43.380
Oh, shit.

14:43.420 --> 14:48.220
[rock music playing
on speakers]

14:51.720 --> 14:53.220
[sizzling]

15:34.070 --> 15:37.370
Hey. Wow. Show's over.

15:39.810 --> 15:40.840
[volume lowers]

15:40.870 --> 15:42.380
[man] Who's this?
[Gar] That's Rachel.

15:42.410 --> 15:44.710
[Cliff]
I was just showing her out.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.150
[man] Out?

15:46.180 --> 15:48.280
Before Chief gets back.

15:48.310 --> 15:51.080
Are you invisible under there?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.290
Wouldn't that be nice?

15:53.320 --> 15:54.690
How do you like your steak?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.890
Unless you're a vegan,
which would break my heart.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.990
She's not staying
for dinner, Larry.

15:59.030 --> 16:01.390
It'll be fine.
Chief is gone until tomorrow.

16:01.430 --> 16:04.000
And even with Rita,
we have plenty of food.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.030
And I am hungry.

16:06.070 --> 16:09.040
And she is hungry.

16:09.070 --> 16:13.210
-It's nice here.
-Right? Told ya.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.580
Let's take a vote.

16:16.610 --> 16:18.140
[Cliff] Really?

16:18.180 --> 16:22.530
Great. Gar, go set the table.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.190
[Dick]<i>She must be scared
</i> <i>out of her mind.</i>

16:28.220 --> 16:29.390
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.690
-You're not coming.
-What? Why?

16:32.730 --> 16:37.100
You're not exactly
the definition
of "blending in."

16:37.130 --> 16:39.100
I've blended in just fine.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.470
I've got the badge.
I can find out

16:40.500 --> 16:42.300
if anyone's seen Rachel
faster without you.

16:42.340 --> 16:45.200
Not to mention,
you're wanted by the police.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.970
This is a police station.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.360
Hurry up.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.880
[officer] Long way
from Detroit, huh?

16:58.920 --> 17:01.120
My sister's kid. Ran away.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.960
We got a report
on this earlier.

17:02.990 --> 17:04.190
Hunter shot himself.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.560
Said something
about a tiger in the woods

17:06.590 --> 17:08.560
with a girl with
purple hair, like this.

17:08.600 --> 17:12.200
-A tiger?
-Yeah, a green one.

17:12.230 --> 17:14.180
He was drunk.

17:18.910 --> 17:22.080
What did you say
that hunter's name was again?

17:22.110 --> 17:25.210
[Larry] Then Cliff
gets into an argument
with the television.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.750
[Cliff] I was not trying
to talk to the TV.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.050
-I was whispering to you.
-[Larry] You were trying to.

17:30.080 --> 17:34.050
[Cliff] "I hate this show.
Please change it."
You know, like that.

17:34.090 --> 17:37.790
-[Larry laughing]
-[Cliff] What?

17:37.820 --> 17:42.820
No, I don't want dessert!
We talked about this!

17:49.430 --> 17:54.210
Rita?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.710
[music playing on TV]

17:56.740 --> 17:58.310
Rita?

17:58.350 --> 18:00.850
I don't know if you're feeling
well enough to come down
and join us for dinner,

18:00.880 --> 18:03.980
but, um, we have a guest.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.390
I'd really love
for you to meet her.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.620
If you think you can
leave your room today.

18:09.660 --> 18:14.310
If not,
it's totally okay. I...

18:20.530 --> 18:21.600
We'll bring up dinner later.

18:21.630 --> 18:23.100
[The Crimson Lady on TV]
<i>Let me go.</i>

18:23.140 --> 18:25.910
[John on TV]<i>No!
</i> <i>You were the one
</i> <i>that invited me here.</i>

18:25.940 --> 18:27.570
[The Crimson Lady]
<i>I wanted to give you
</i> <i>the respect</i>

18:27.610 --> 18:29.310
<i>-you deserve by
</i> <i>ending this in person.

18:29.340 --> 18:31.540
[John]<i>Since when is respect
</i> <i>something you give?</i>

18:31.580 --> 18:34.110
Break the rules the world set.

18:34.150 --> 18:37.420
<i>Define love
</i> <i>the way you want to.</i>

18:37.450 --> 18:39.290
[The Crimson Lady]
<i>It won't work
</i> <i>between us, John.</i>

18:39.320 --> 18:40.690
<i>We're too different,
</i> <i>you and I.</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:42.620
<i>-It doesn't matter how
</i> <i>different we are.
</i> <i>-Let go!</i>

18:42.660 --> 18:47.660
<i>No! We both feel it...
</i> <i>and that's all there is.</i>

18:49.030 --> 18:53.080
[liquid continues sloshing]

19:03.080 --> 19:07.150
[John]<i>You are cruel.</i>

19:07.180 --> 19:12.180
[The Crimson Lady]
<i>Not as cruel
</i> <i>as you'd have me be.</i>

19:18.260 --> 19:23.260
[jazz music playing
over speakers]

19:45.080 --> 19:47.120
[Larry] All right, then.

19:47.150 --> 19:48.650
Let's eat.

19:58.670 --> 20:01.770
[Larry] For God's sake, Cliff,
stop staring at the poor girl.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.240
So, are the waffles
crispy on the outside

20:04.270 --> 20:06.270
and gooey a little bit
on the inside

20:06.310 --> 20:09.910
with just
the right amount of butter?

20:09.940 --> 20:10.980
They're perfect.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.080
Yeah.

20:12.110 --> 20:14.510
Try the chicken.

20:26.330 --> 20:28.960
[stammers]
What's that taste like?

20:28.990 --> 20:31.330
Crunchy and moist.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.870
Oh, God!
I used to love fried chicken.

20:34.900 --> 20:39.610
I loved to eat, swim,
loved to dance.

20:39.640 --> 20:43.380
I used to love dancing.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.080
Why can't you dance?

20:45.110 --> 20:50.110
Oh, forget it. You're young.
Nobody's dancing with this.

20:54.250 --> 20:57.060
I would.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.940
[hums rhythmically]

21:02.500 --> 21:05.400
[Larry laughs]

21:05.430 --> 21:10.240
She can stay.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.240
Sounds like
everyone's having fun.

21:13.270 --> 21:14.980
I'm so sorry I'm late.

21:15.010 --> 21:18.340
-[Larry] Oh, Rita.
-I was putting myself
together.

21:18.380 --> 21:20.780
You know, it takes some time.

21:20.810 --> 21:23.880
[sighs] Hmm.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.220
I hear we have a guest
from the outside.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.790
How wonderful.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.190
I'm Rita.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.290
Rachel.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.830
Delighted.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.350
I'm famished.

22:02.190 --> 22:05.060
[Rita] Thank you.

22:05.090 --> 22:10.090
My condition requires
a particularly high
caloric intake.

22:10.430 --> 22:15.080
Can you
pass the gravy, please?

22:15.930 --> 22:18.480
[Rita] Thank you.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.860
[Rita] Mmm.

22:41.890 --> 22:42.490
Mmm.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.340
Well, this is
absolutely delicious, Larry.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.840
[Larry] Someone kiss the cook.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.610
-[laughing]
-[Larry] Seriously.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.210
Anyone--
I'll take it from anyone.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.640
-Anybody?
-[all laughing]

22:58.680 --> 23:03.680
[Larry] All right, no takers.
All right. [chuckling]

23:05.280 --> 23:10.020
[flesh squelching]

23:10.060 --> 23:12.060
Are you okay?

23:12.090 --> 23:13.730
Uh...

23:13.760 --> 23:15.500
[Larry] Rita?
[Rita] I...

23:15.530 --> 23:20.530
[voice distorting]
I should have stayed in bed.

23:30.340 --> 23:31.380
Help!

23:31.410 --> 23:33.210
[laughing hysterically]

23:33.250 --> 23:38.250
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me! Somebody...

23:40.720 --> 23:43.570
[Rachel] It's okay.

23:47.530 --> 23:50.830
I'm not afraid of you.

23:56.670 --> 23:58.770
[Rita exhales]

24:04.380 --> 24:07.210
[door opens]

24:07.250 --> 24:08.510
[Chief] Who is this?

24:08.550 --> 24:11.120
Chief. Uh, I can explain.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.690
Later.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.870
I have a new patient.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.230
-[monitor beeping]
-[Cliff] Who is she?

24:25.260 --> 24:27.700
Her name is Shyleen Lao.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.540
Cliff, the O2, stat.

24:29.570 --> 24:30.600
Close.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.670
Rita, run the IV.

24:32.710 --> 24:35.560
Gar, my case. Okay.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.540
Larry, any time.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.620
[Larry] Oh, she's hot.
Even for me.

24:46.650 --> 24:48.590
[Rita] What happened to her?

24:48.620 --> 24:50.990
A protest she organized
turned violent.

24:51.020 --> 24:54.390
A nearby tanker exploded.
She was engulfed
in liquid nitrogen.

24:54.430 --> 24:57.660
The doctors treating her
said there was nothing
they could do.

24:57.700 --> 25:01.230
But she's a good soul,
one worth saving.

25:01.270 --> 25:02.440
Poor thing.

25:02.470 --> 25:07.470
This serum
should help stabilize
her body temperature.

25:07.510 --> 25:09.510
Mmm-hmm.

25:09.540 --> 25:12.210
There, I think.

25:12.240 --> 25:17.080
[monitor flatlines]

25:17.120 --> 25:18.580
What the fuck?

25:18.620 --> 25:20.820
[Larry] Chief?

25:20.850 --> 25:22.720
[Gar] What's happening?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.760
-Her body is reacting
to my serum.
-[Shyleen gasping]

25:24.790 --> 25:26.590
[Rita] It's freezing in here.

25:26.630 --> 25:29.200
She is
altering the temperature
around us.

25:29.230 --> 25:34.230
We need
to keep her warm.
Blankets!

25:39.770 --> 25:41.770
[speaking Vietnamese]

25:41.810 --> 25:44.780
[Cliff] Hey, uh, does anyone
speak whatever that is?

25:44.810 --> 25:47.510
[Larry] Hey, hey. You're okay.
Deep breath.

25:47.550 --> 25:50.420
-Just breathe, okay?
-[Shyleen gasping]

25:50.450 --> 25:54.150
[Shyleen sobbing]

25:54.190 --> 25:57.620
[Rachel] I can help
ease your pain.

25:57.660 --> 26:01.930
I know you're frightened.

26:01.960 --> 26:06.000
[distorted voice] It's okay.

26:06.030 --> 26:07.870
It's okay.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.950
[Shyleen breathing shakily]

26:14.770 --> 26:18.540
[air hissing]

26:18.580 --> 26:19.680
[Chief sighs]

26:19.710 --> 26:22.620
Get sedation.

26:22.650 --> 26:26.400
[Cliff] And she's stable.

26:28.890 --> 26:31.590
She needs to rest.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.970
[Chief]
You are risking everything
bringing someone here.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.400
It could destroy this family.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.370
Is that what you want?

26:44.400 --> 26:45.610
No, sir.

26:45.640 --> 26:49.640
I have only asked
for one thing from you
over the years.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.710
What is it?

26:50.740 --> 26:53.280
To trust you.

26:53.310 --> 26:57.050
I'm very disappointed
in you, Garfield.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.790
Cliff, Larry, and Rita,
they cannot go where you can.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.320
If we get discovered,

27:02.360 --> 27:06.290
they will end up locked away,
like Rita once was.

27:06.330 --> 27:11.130
Experimented on, tortured.

27:11.160 --> 27:16.160
You are
an incredibly selfish boy.

27:19.810 --> 27:23.260
Never disobey me again.

27:25.080 --> 27:28.610
Yes, sir.

27:28.650 --> 27:29.700
[sighs]

27:34.320 --> 27:37.990
Garfield, I'm sorry
I had to be so stern.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.730
You know how much I care

27:39.760 --> 27:44.760
about you
and the others, don't you?

27:45.100 --> 27:46.400
[sighs]

27:46.430 --> 27:47.870
Good.

27:47.900 --> 27:52.900
Now, tell me. When this girl
touched our new patient,
she healed her.

27:55.610 --> 27:59.810
What else is she capable of?

28:03.480 --> 28:06.220
I can help her, Garfield.

28:06.250 --> 28:09.420
Tell me.

28:09.460 --> 28:14.460
Did you hear
about the explosion
at the convent?

28:24.740 --> 28:28.740
[dog barking]

28:28.770 --> 28:30.440
What do you want?

28:30.480 --> 28:33.550
Need to talk to you
about the girl
you saw in the forest.

28:33.580 --> 28:34.850
What?

28:34.880 --> 28:37.580
Did she say anything?
Did you see where she went?

28:37.620 --> 28:40.990
You know,
I already talked to the cops,
so you can fuck off.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.890
Hey! You can't do that!

28:42.920 --> 28:44.390
I'm gonna need you
to answer my questions.

28:44.420 --> 28:47.420
You better back off!

28:53.270 --> 28:55.630
Did you see
where the girl went?

28:55.670 --> 28:57.200
[man panting]

28:57.240 --> 28:58.070
Answer me!

28:58.100 --> 29:02.150
-You're a psycho!
-[grunts]

29:04.640 --> 29:06.650
Did you hurt her?

29:06.680 --> 29:08.580
Did you touch her?

29:08.610 --> 29:10.250
[grunts] Did you touch her?

29:10.280 --> 29:11.620
Did you hurt her?

29:11.650 --> 29:13.790
[Kory] Dick.

29:13.820 --> 29:14.890
Dick!

29:14.920 --> 29:19.660
Dick, stop!

29:19.690 --> 29:20.590
Daddy?

29:24.800 --> 29:25.700
Daddy!

29:36.040 --> 29:38.680
I would never hurt no girl.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.380
No kid.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.750
The only place out there
is the old Caulder house.

29:43.780 --> 29:46.950
-Where?
-It's out on Danny Street.

29:46.990 --> 29:51.990
But it's all locked up.
Ain't no one there.

29:55.530 --> 29:56.430
Sorry.

30:03.170 --> 30:07.520
[breathing heavily] Fuck you.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.880
It's okay.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.810
It's okay.

30:13.850 --> 30:15.850
[Rachel] I didn't mean
to be any trouble.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.150
-I'm sorry.
-[Chief] Don't be sorry.

30:18.180 --> 30:21.090
You helped us
save that young woman's life,

30:21.120 --> 30:24.290
and we are
very grateful for it.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.060
You were a surprise to me.
That's all.

30:27.090 --> 30:29.630
[Cliff] I tried
to warn the kid.

30:29.660 --> 30:34.660
Well, we keep
what we're doing here
very secret, you see?

30:34.830 --> 30:39.630
And what is it
that you do here?

30:40.210 --> 30:44.710
I help people
that others have given up on.

30:44.750 --> 30:49.680
I go beyond
what medical science
is willing to do...

30:49.720 --> 30:52.990
because I believe in hope.

30:53.020 --> 30:57.520
Don't you?

30:57.560 --> 31:01.060
Our dear Rita
had been in an institution
for decades

31:01.090 --> 31:05.560
after a toxic gas
left her cells unstable.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.630
I freed her.

31:06.670 --> 31:08.830
And I'm very thankful, Chief.

31:08.870 --> 31:11.810
Then Larry.
A pilot in the Air Force,

31:11.840 --> 31:16.840
he crashed his plane
and was exposed
to negative energy.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.780
He was given
mere days to live.

31:20.810 --> 31:23.980
That was over 50 years ago.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.720
Cliff's story
you already know.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.920
And finally, Garfield.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.960
[Gar chuckles softly]

31:30.990 --> 31:32.290
He cured me.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.230
From what?

31:33.260 --> 31:35.560
[Chief]
A rare disease he contracted

31:35.600 --> 31:40.600
from an even rarer
species of primate
in the Congo basin.

31:40.930 --> 31:45.770
Although,
the cure I administered
had unforeseen side effects.

31:45.810 --> 31:50.240
Chief thinks
that I can unzip my DNA
and rearrange it.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.980
It took me a while
to figure it out, but--

31:52.010 --> 31:54.410
So that's how you can...

31:54.450 --> 31:55.980
But why a--

31:56.020 --> 31:58.420
I don't know.
He thinks it's psychological.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.650
Tigers have always
been my favorite.
Ever since I was a kid.

32:01.690 --> 32:05.490
So, you all just live here?

32:05.530 --> 32:09.130
This isn't simply
a sanctuary, Rachel.

32:09.160 --> 32:12.670
It's an incubation chamber,
an experiment.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.030
The work I do on them

32:14.070 --> 32:18.510
will push medical science
forward decades
in a matter of years.

32:18.540 --> 32:23.540
What's happening here
will one day save thousands,
even millions, of lives.

32:26.180 --> 32:31.180
I think
I can help you, too, Rachel.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.960
You... You can't help me.

32:34.990 --> 32:39.990
That's what they said
about Cliff, Larry, Rita,
and Garfield.

32:41.130 --> 32:43.000
That I couldn't.

32:43.030 --> 32:47.230
That they were doomed.

32:47.270 --> 32:52.270
And yet, here they all sit,
enjoying dessert.

32:55.310 --> 33:00.310
If you'd let me examine you,
do some tests...

33:01.180 --> 33:02.980
[Rachel sighs]

33:03.020 --> 33:06.770
Rachel, you're not alone.

33:18.060 --> 33:21.430
I didn't know
you had it in you.

33:21.470 --> 33:24.740
What?

33:24.770 --> 33:29.270
The way you attacked that man.

33:29.910 --> 33:32.550
It's none of my business,

33:32.580 --> 33:35.380
but if you don't unbury
whatever it is
that's going on,

33:35.420 --> 33:37.850
you're gonna explode.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.550
Just like her.

33:40.590 --> 33:42.790
You were a shrink
in your past life?

33:42.820 --> 33:47.820
Maybe.
Maybe I'm a shrink
in this life. Who knows?

33:48.090 --> 33:51.230
You got problems.

33:51.260 --> 33:56.260
You seem like a nice guy,
but I'm not so sure.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.270
I went through something
when I was a kid.

34:01.310 --> 34:04.680
So, this is all about you?

34:04.710 --> 34:08.480
I don't want her
to make the same mistakes
I did.

34:08.520 --> 34:12.870
Trusting in the wrong people.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.290
You may have
gone through some bad shit.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.120
I may have, too. I don't know.

34:18.160 --> 34:23.160
But what I do know
is that no one manages alone.

34:26.230 --> 34:31.230
I don't have to remember much
to rember that.

35:25.660 --> 35:27.290
[Rachel]<i>Does it
</i> <i>have to be so tight?</i>

35:27.330 --> 35:32.330
Yes. This ability you possess
is likely tied
to your nervous system.

35:32.530 --> 35:37.240
Trying to analyze it
could trigger
some physical movements.

35:37.270 --> 35:39.040
I don't want you getting hurt.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.570
Chief, are you sure
about this?

35:40.610 --> 35:42.510
This is a relatively
simple procedure,

35:42.540 --> 35:45.110
given what I've
dealt with before.

35:45.140 --> 35:47.080
Bring me my case.

35:47.110 --> 35:48.580
Why? What are you gonna do?

35:48.620 --> 35:52.750
You are here
to assist me, Garfield,

35:52.790 --> 35:55.290
not to question me.
Understood?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.990
-Yeah, but I--
-Do what I ask.

35:59.020 --> 36:01.890
For her.

36:01.930 --> 36:02.980
Please?

36:10.800 --> 36:13.500
Thank you, my boy.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.650
I can remove
whatever's inside you.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.950
[Rachel] No.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.520
No, wait, wait.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.160
I don't wanna do this anymore.

36:29.190 --> 36:32.890
This is for your own good,
my child.

36:32.930 --> 36:34.360
I promise you.

36:34.390 --> 36:39.300
Let me up. Please.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.270
Gar...

36:41.300 --> 36:43.000
please.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.910
Let me up.

36:45.940 --> 36:48.790
Sit down, Garfield.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.980
Sit back down.

36:59.890 --> 37:02.120
No.

37:02.150 --> 37:04.490
"No"?

37:04.520 --> 37:08.060
She doesn't want
to do this anymore.

37:08.090 --> 37:10.000
I've gotta unstrap her.

37:10.030 --> 37:12.970
Leave this room. Now.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.330
Chief...

37:15.370 --> 37:18.240
let her go.

37:18.270 --> 37:21.910
[growling]

37:21.940 --> 37:24.040
[roars]

37:24.080 --> 37:26.910
I mean it.

37:26.950 --> 37:27.550
Gar!

37:41.060 --> 37:43.200
He'll be all right.

37:43.230 --> 37:45.600
You hurt him.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.170
[demonic voice]
You hurt my friend.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.400
[groans]

37:54.040 --> 37:56.340
Now, I'll hurt you.

37:56.380 --> 37:59.080
[static crackling]

38:22.100 --> 38:24.200
[low growling]

38:31.440 --> 38:33.240
Fascinating.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.470
[Dick] Hello?

38:51.930 --> 38:55.130
[gasps]

38:55.170 --> 38:56.820
[screaming]

39:10.920 --> 39:15.820
[softly] Get out.

39:15.850 --> 39:17.050
Get out!

39:21.430 --> 39:25.480
[Chief continues screaming]

39:30.540 --> 39:33.370
[screaming]

39:33.410 --> 39:35.110
Rachel.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.540
Go.

39:37.580 --> 39:38.780
[Larry]
Don't make me fight you.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.280
You don't wanna see
what I really am.

39:41.310 --> 39:46.290
Same.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.370
Rachel!

39:53.130 --> 39:55.160
[distorted screaming]

39:55.190 --> 39:57.260
Rachel!

39:57.300 --> 39:58.350
Rachel!

40:09.540 --> 40:11.780
Rachel! Rachel! Hey.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.610
[demonic voice]
You're going to die.

40:14.650 --> 40:17.250
Get out of here,
before it's too late.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.150
I'm not going anywhere.

40:19.190 --> 40:21.320
I don't wanna hurt you.

40:21.360 --> 40:25.730
Listen, I was wrong.
When I told you
no one can help you.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.930
Dick, you need
to leave. Please.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.330
At the church,
when I said
you're on your own.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.130
Okay, I was wrong.

40:33.170 --> 40:35.430
You're not on your own.

40:35.470 --> 40:38.600
Okay? You have me. I'm here.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.840
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

40:41.880 --> 40:44.380
I'm not going anywhere.

40:44.410 --> 40:45.410
Here I am.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.680
[sobbing]

40:46.710 --> 40:49.980
[Dick] I'm right here.

40:50.020 --> 40:51.520
It's okay.

41:26.420 --> 41:28.990
[Cliff] Go. Go with them.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.320
Go have a life.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.790
But the Chief.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.290
[Larry] His back
is broken again.
We'll take care of him.

41:34.330 --> 41:35.730
He helped us, Gar.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.630
No matter what,
we owe it to Chief
to help him now.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.170
Um, maybe you guys can come.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.570
I mean, you don't
have to hide anymore.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.270
[Cliff] It is what it is, kid.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.940
But you...

41:47.970 --> 41:50.780
[sniffles]

41:50.810 --> 41:54.710
You can have more than us.

42:13.100 --> 42:15.130
[Cliff] All right.
Now get going, will ya?

42:15.170 --> 42:19.670
Green fool.

42:19.710 --> 42:23.160
Rachel, get in the car.

42:35.820 --> 42:39.830
[car engine starts]

42:39.860 --> 42:42.600
[car departing]

42:42.630 --> 42:43.830
[Larry] So, who's hungry?
