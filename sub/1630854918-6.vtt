HARRY:
I'm Harry Tasker,

00:02.278 --> 00:05.039
husband, dad, computer
salesman,

00:05.177 --> 00:08.180
and for 17 years the most
important person in my life

00:08.318 --> 00:09.975
didn't know
I was also something else.

00:10.976 --> 00:13.427
Omega Sector's top spy.

00:13.565 --> 00:14.911
HELEN:
I'm Helen Tasker,

00:15.049 --> 00:16.913
wife, mom and professor.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.708
After an unfortunate incident

00:18.846 --> 00:21.090
where I found out
our whole life was a lie,

00:21.228 --> 00:23.713
now I'm also a spy.

00:24.748 --> 00:26.785
HARRY:
Honey, all those things
are true.

00:26.923 --> 00:28.373
-They're just, you know...
-HELEN: What?

00:28.511 --> 00:30.823
HARRY:
True lies.

00:30.961 --> 00:32.998

00:37.278 --> 00:38.693
GIB [on comms]:
Harry, status check.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.454
HARRY:
I got the file, Gib.

00:40.592 --> 00:42.318
I'm on my way back.
I'm one klick out.

00:43.353 --> 00:44.630
GIB:
Copy that.

00:44.768 --> 00:46.977
I'll be here waiting on you.

00:51.672 --> 00:53.467
Hey, hey, Harry,

00:53.605 --> 00:55.779
you've got a truck
and a motorcycle incoming fast

00:55.917 --> 00:56.780
to your position.

00:56.918 --> 00:58.127
They do not look friendly.

00:58.265 --> 00:59.300
Are they armed?

01:00.439 --> 01:01.889
I'm seeing ropes.

01:02.027 --> 01:04.236
So I think they want you alive.

01:04.373 --> 01:06.583
Or, you know,
alive enough to question.

01:10.518 --> 01:12.486
Harry, bad guy
coming up on your left.

01:12.624 --> 01:13.901
Hey, you got to
get out of there.

01:14.039 --> 01:15.489
HARRY:
How-- drive through a building?

01:15.627 --> 01:18.078
I got no place to go, Gib.

01:27.673 --> 01:28.536

01:33.645 --> 01:34.887
Harry, y-you okay?

01:35.025 --> 01:36.234
Well, it could be better.

01:36.372 --> 01:37.614
I'm getting dragged
down the street.

01:37.752 --> 01:39.408
GIB:
There's a flatbed pulling out.

01:39.547 --> 01:40.445
You're gonna get smashed.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.067
I'm working on it, Gib.

01:47.624 --> 01:49.247

01:49.384 --> 01:50.386
[exhales]

01:51.490 --> 01:52.871
Thank God you had that thing.

01:53.009 --> 01:55.494
It's my lucky knife
for a reason.

01:55.632 --> 01:56.875
Oof.

02:05.263 --> 02:06.367
Hey, honey?

02:06.505 --> 02:07.782
Where's my lucky knife?

02:07.920 --> 02:08.955
Oh, I moved it.

02:10.301 --> 02:12.856
Technically, you're not supposed
to have non-regulation weapons

02:12.994 --> 02:14.375
in the Omega gun safe.

02:14.513 --> 02:15.376
Just guns.

02:15.514 --> 02:16.619
Gun stuff.

02:16.757 --> 02:17.861
Oh.

02:17.999 --> 02:19.277
Okay. So where is it?

02:19.415 --> 02:21.486
Uh, check your sock drawer.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.214
Hey, honey. I really appreciate
all the organizing

02:25.352 --> 02:26.905
-you've been doing. I do.
-Thank you.

02:27.043 --> 02:29.770
But, you know, I just have a way
that I like my things.

02:29.908 --> 02:32.082
-You'll like this better. You
just have to get used to it.
-Yeah, you know,

02:32.221 --> 02:34.567
I've been doing
the spy thing a long time,

02:34.706 --> 02:37.156
and I like my way of organizing.

02:37.295 --> 02:38.399
So...

02:38.537 --> 02:40.746
I'm familiar with
your way of organizing.

02:41.781 --> 02:42.817
What is that supposed to mean?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.923
The IKEA bookshelf?

02:45.061 --> 02:46.062
What's wrong
with the IKEA bookshelf?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.167
-I-I built it fine.
-Uh...

02:47.305 --> 02:49.583
All the drawers
were upside down.

02:49.721 --> 02:51.309
-The drawers weren't
upside down.
-They were.

02:51.447 --> 02:52.930
Well, they were both sides
the same.

02:53.069 --> 02:54.346
-No, Mr. Man.
-I don't know,
but it works fine.

02:54.484 --> 02:55.416
Totally efficient.

02:55.554 --> 02:56.417
Hey, honey, it's not in here.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.591
Okay.
Check the junk drawer.

02:59.696 --> 03:01.077
Helen,

03:01.215 --> 03:03.528
my lucky knife is not junk.

03:05.495 --> 03:06.600
Helen?

03:06.738 --> 03:07.704
-Hi, Jill.
-JILL: Hi.

03:07.842 --> 03:09.050
-Good morning.
-JILL: Good morning.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.674
Just the usual.
Salted caramel latte, please.

03:11.812 --> 03:13.434
-No problem.
-Are you kidding me?

03:13.572 --> 03:14.504
Do you know how much
sugar is in that?

03:14.642 --> 03:16.023
-Hi. Jill.
-Hi.

03:16.161 --> 03:17.197
We're gonna put a pin
in the diabetes.

03:17.335 --> 03:18.681
He's gonna have a coffee, black.

03:18.819 --> 03:20.372
And I'll have
a latte with oat milk.

03:20.510 --> 03:21.960
JILL:
Okay. You got it.
Coming right up.

03:22.098 --> 03:23.203
-Thank you.
-HELEN: Okay.

03:23.341 --> 03:24.273
Come on. Tell me
about this conference

03:24.411 --> 03:25.377
we're going to in Mexico.

03:25.515 --> 03:27.207
It's the Telonyx
sales conference.

03:27.345 --> 03:28.691
You've been before, honey.

03:28.829 --> 03:31.211
Yeah, but that was before I knew
it was a cover for...

03:31.349 --> 03:34.317
mysterious spy activities.

03:34.454 --> 03:36.388
Oh, is that why you're dressed
like a 1930s detective?

03:37.527 --> 03:38.942
I'm dressed like a spy.

03:39.079 --> 03:40.634
A professional spy.

03:40.772 --> 03:42.843
Well, look,
it's not that mysterious.

03:42.981 --> 03:44.879
Every year, Omega Sector

03:45.017 --> 03:46.985
meets with spies from different
countries to go over threats,

03:47.123 --> 03:48.745
exchange info, stuff like that.

03:48.883 --> 03:51.231
But then why do they have to
have a computer sales conference

03:51.369 --> 03:52.542
at the same time?

03:52.680 --> 03:53.819
They have to send
out a whole team

03:53.957 --> 03:55.406
to set up logistics
and security.

03:55.545 --> 03:57.892
That many people showing
up to a resort every year

03:58.030 --> 04:00.101
-looks suspicious.
-[bell dings]

04:00.240 --> 04:02.552
-JILL: Order's ready.
-That's why they created the
Telonyx family sales retreat.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.554
-Our order's ready.
-No, your order's ready.

04:04.692 --> 04:07.005
-We never ordered my order.
-GIB: Okay,

04:07.143 --> 04:09.145
so this is the agenda
for the trip.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.733
This year,
we're meeting with reps

04:10.871 --> 04:12.666
from the Mexican
intelligence services.

04:12.804 --> 04:14.254
Emerging terror groups,

04:14.392 --> 04:16.980
weapons proliferation,
industrial espionage--

04:17.118 --> 04:18.947
the usual list of nightmares.

04:19.086 --> 04:21.744
Also in here
is the sales retreat info.

04:21.882 --> 04:24.505
You're gonna have to choose
chicken or beef for the banquet.

04:24.643 --> 04:25.851
-Ooh, what-what kind of beef?
-Mm.

04:25.989 --> 04:28.509
GIB:
Short ribs. Uh, and, please,

04:28.647 --> 04:30.270
study the sales
training schedule,

04:30.408 --> 04:32.168
because I expect you
to be there. Yes,

04:32.306 --> 04:33.582
I'm looking at you, Maria.

04:33.721 --> 04:35.240
What?
No. No. No, no, no,

04:35.378 --> 04:37.242
no, no, no.
They're so boring.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.692
Last year, this guy

04:38.830 --> 04:41.004
literally said
"Is it scalable?" 17 times.

04:41.142 --> 04:42.523
It's your cover ID.

04:42.661 --> 04:44.180
-HARRY: Yeah.
-GIB: And it's important.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.871
All right?
We all got to do it.

04:46.009 --> 04:48.426
Moving on, looks like
Luther's gonna be

04:48.564 --> 04:49.599
salesman of the year.

04:49.737 --> 04:52.430
Oh! Hey.
I love computer sales.

04:52.568 --> 04:53.569
[laughs]

04:53.707 --> 04:54.466
It's about
bringing people together.

04:54.604 --> 04:55.571
All right. Okay.

04:55.709 --> 04:57.262
Very mature.
Making fun of the guy

04:57.400 --> 04:58.712
who takes
his cover ID seriously.

04:58.850 --> 05:02.232
I take mine very seriously.
It's just my cover ID is

05:02.371 --> 05:04.994
"person who doesn't care
about the sales cheeseballs

05:05.132 --> 05:08.377
and who gets everyone dancing at
the after-party." You know, fun.

05:08.515 --> 05:12.242
The salespeople, Maria,
are not cheeseballs.

05:12.381 --> 05:15.315
And I would say "party lady"
is hardly a valid cover.

05:15.453 --> 05:17.075
-Ooh.
-MARIA: Party lady?

05:17.213 --> 05:19.940
Okay, anything that is not
"Omega Sector spy"

05:20.078 --> 05:20.941
is a cover ID, Luther.

05:21.079 --> 05:22.874
What's my cover ID?

05:23.012 --> 05:24.565
Spouse.

05:24.703 --> 05:26.222
-Ah.
-GIB: Remember, study up.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.292
Chicken or beef.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.226
What are you doing?

05:30.364 --> 05:31.745
I chose the beef.

05:31.883 --> 05:33.643
I saw your
cholesterol levels, so

05:33.781 --> 05:35.507
you're gonna have the chicken.

05:37.544 --> 05:39.511
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

05:40.995 --> 05:42.100
HARRY:
Hey, Gib?

05:44.102 --> 05:45.483
Wait up a second.

05:45.621 --> 05:46.829
I need some advice.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.933
-What's up?
-It's about Helen.

05:49.072 --> 05:52.593
Um, ever since she became
an official team member,

05:52.731 --> 05:53.939
she's... I don't know.

05:54.077 --> 05:56.148
She's kind of
changing stuff around.

05:56.286 --> 05:57.598
You know? She's...

05:57.736 --> 05:59.497
kind of messing with my vibe
a little bit.

05:59.635 --> 06:01.257
-Okay.
-Gib,

06:01.395 --> 06:02.914
she lost my lucky knife.

06:03.052 --> 06:04.087
No.

06:04.225 --> 06:05.537
Yes.

06:05.675 --> 06:07.090
Oh...

06:07.228 --> 06:08.195
Oh.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.610
I know.

06:09.748 --> 06:11.612
But I don't know
what to tell you, Harry.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.200
You're the one who brought her
into this thing.

06:13.338 --> 06:15.547
I know. But I was trying
to save my marriage.

06:15.685 --> 06:17.860
And now it's all so complicated.

06:17.998 --> 06:19.068
Yeah.

06:19.206 --> 06:20.380
You see, that right there--

06:20.518 --> 06:22.416
that's why I don't mix
work and relationships.

06:22.554 --> 06:24.798
Yeah, well, that ship
has kind of sailed for me.

06:24.936 --> 06:26.247
So, I was hoping...

06:26.386 --> 06:28.698
I was thinking maybe
you could talk to her for me.

06:28.836 --> 06:29.941
Me?

06:30.079 --> 06:32.081
-Yes.
-No.

06:32.219 --> 06:33.909
-You're really good at it.
-Not at that. No way.

06:34.048 --> 06:35.705
I'm not getting
in the middle of you two.

06:35.843 --> 06:37.638

08:52.083 --> 08:53.463
to my bowling thing?

08:53.602 --> 08:55.707
I was just trying
to keep up the cover story.

08:55.845 --> 08:57.606
Have you seen Brad bowl?

08:58.572 --> 09:00.401
I've seen him dance.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.715
Hey, Gib.

09:03.853 --> 09:04.716
You like the cocktails?

09:04.854 --> 09:06.960
-Hey. Eva.
-[laughs]

09:07.098 --> 09:08.513
Uh, yeah. Oh, they're great.

09:08.651 --> 09:11.136
You know, you do a wonderful job

09:11.274 --> 09:12.966
putting this conference
together every year.

09:13.104 --> 09:14.070
-[chuckles]
-Really. No, really.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.658
Thank you. Well...

09:15.796 --> 09:17.971
well, the administrative stuff
isn't all that exciting,

09:18.109 --> 09:19.800
-but...
-[chuckles]

09:21.146 --> 09:23.148
I-I just wanted
to let you know I handled all

09:23.286 --> 09:25.668
the pre-contact
reports with Omega.

09:27.705 --> 09:29.569
Uh, you didn't have to...

09:29.707 --> 09:31.709
-Wow. Wow.
-[laughs] Yeah.

09:31.847 --> 09:34.159
-[chuckles]
-Well, it's no problem.

09:34.297 --> 09:38.370
I... I just wanted you
to have a little free time.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.477
Maybe, you know...

09:41.615 --> 09:42.892
dance a little?

09:43.030 --> 09:46.378
-No. Uh, that's nice,
but, uh, uh...
-Oh.

09:46.516 --> 09:48.242
You know, I, um...

09:48.380 --> 09:49.727
I should probably go
double-check those reports.

09:49.865 --> 09:50.900
-Oh.
-It's-it's get...

09:51.038 --> 09:52.177
-Hey.
-Wow.

09:52.315 --> 09:53.247
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.111
-All right. See you.
-Okay. Bye.

10:06.226 --> 10:07.883
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
make you some hot cocoa,

10:08.021 --> 10:12.301
and then you guys are gonna have
a fun day with big activities.

10:13.509 --> 10:17.030
If I can just get
this thing open.

10:17.168 --> 10:18.687
Just cut it.
I mean, where's your knife?

10:18.825 --> 10:21.413
[grunts] I'm not sure.
Ask your mom.

10:22.829 --> 10:23.864
-Oh...
-JAKE [chuckles]: Oh, nice.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.970
Man, I got to snap this.

10:26.108 --> 10:27.385
-Jake, come on.
-[shutter clicks]
-DANA: Okay,

10:27.523 --> 10:28.351
forget it. We're gonna be late.

10:28.489 --> 10:30.043
Late for what?

10:30.181 --> 10:31.838
The, uh...
the ATV thing.

10:31.976 --> 10:33.633
-To some ruins.
Supposed to be really great.
-Oh.

10:33.771 --> 10:36.118
Ooh.
ATVing to some ruins.

10:36.256 --> 10:38.534
Those guys have the right idea.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.225
-[door closes]
-All right,

10:40.363 --> 10:41.951
we should go to the pre-meeting
briefing with the Omega team.

10:42.089 --> 10:44.402
Absolutely.
But I need to change my shirt.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.231
We don't have to be down there
for another half hour anyway.

10:46.369 --> 10:47.785
Oh, that's what you say
whenever we go to the airport,

10:47.923 --> 10:48.786
and we're always late.

10:48.924 --> 10:50.165
Honey, I'm a spy.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.547
-I'm also a spy.
-I know you are.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.480
But I've been to these meetings

10:53.618 --> 10:55.896
-a-a lot of times.
-Hon, I think, well,

10:56.034 --> 10:57.657
there's always room
for improvement.

10:57.795 --> 11:00.590
Ho-ho-ho.
Look who's early.

11:00.729 --> 11:02.903
Helen, you area good influence.
Usually, we're waiting

11:03.041 --> 11:04.077
-on this guy.
-Oh.

11:04.215 --> 11:05.423
-Okay.
-Huh.

11:05.561 --> 11:07.252
[chuckles]
He didn't say I was late.

11:07.390 --> 11:09.323
[clears throat]
You smell delicious.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.360
Is that cocoa?

11:11.498 --> 11:12.844
It's cocoa powder.
I told you that I should have

11:12.982 --> 11:14.018
-changed my shirt.
-GIB: Hey, guys, let's focus.

11:14.156 --> 11:15.433
Focus up.

11:15.571 --> 11:17.677
Eva and her team did a great job
prepping for the meeting.

11:17.815 --> 11:19.471
She's gonna go over details.

11:19.609 --> 11:20.818
We've got a window of two hours

11:20.956 --> 11:22.889
while the sales team
is at a training.

11:23.027 --> 11:26.099
-Tomas is head of security.
He prepped the meeting site.
-It's an old house

11:26.237 --> 11:27.859
on the north side of the lake.
The official story

11:27.997 --> 11:30.586
is it's a congratulations
lunch for Luther Tenet.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.381
While you guys are out,
Ramon, Sofia

11:32.519 --> 11:34.348
and I--
we'll hold down the fort here.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.005
Luther's doing a security sweep

11:36.143 --> 11:37.179
with the Mexican delegation
right now.

11:37.317 --> 11:38.283
When he gives us the all clear,

11:38.421 --> 11:39.526
we'll head that direction.

11:39.664 --> 11:41.010
-[phone vibrates]
Till then, we'll... Oh.

11:41.148 --> 11:42.563
Well, look at that.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.531
Hey, right on time, man.
We were just talking about you.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.740
We're all set here, so
if everything's good with you,

11:46.878 --> 11:48.777
-we'll just, uh...
-Well, everything
is definitely not good.

11:48.915 --> 11:50.192
What?
What's going on?

11:50.330 --> 11:51.503
I don't know.
It looks like someone rolled up

11:51.641 --> 11:52.815
on the Mexican delegation

11:52.953 --> 11:55.300
and they bailed out of here
in a big hurry.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.233
The delegation torched
all the files they could,

11:57.371 --> 12:00.236
and they got away,
but this place has been tossed.

12:00.374 --> 12:01.962
Okay, that's bad. That's, uh...
that's-that's really bad.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.757
Bad? What's bad?

12:03.895 --> 12:05.966
I'm not sure yet. Harry,
can you get eyes on the road?

12:06.104 --> 12:08.693
So, let me get this straight.
There was no message,

12:08.831 --> 12:10.074
no note, no nothing?

12:10.212 --> 12:12.352
Gib, I'm telling you,
these guys are gone.

12:19.635 --> 12:21.326
GIB:
If that place got searched,
then we could be compromised.

12:21.464 --> 12:23.259
There's no "if" about it, Gib.

12:24.813 --> 12:27.816
Armed forces on their way.
Guys, we're under attack.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.338
-Eva, Eva, Eva.
-Yes?

12:33.476 --> 12:35.064
We need to make sure
that all the kids

12:35.202 --> 12:36.756
and the spouses out
on activities stay away.

12:36.894 --> 12:37.998
On it.

12:38.136 --> 12:39.344
Hey, Sofia, Ramon,
check the common areas.

12:39.482 --> 12:41.415
Make sure we don't have
any stragglers

12:41.553 --> 12:42.900
-roaming the premises.
-GIB: Hey, Maria,

12:43.038 --> 12:44.764
the sales team
is in their breakout session

12:44.902 --> 12:46.075
in the conference wing.

12:46.213 --> 12:47.594
Okay, you got to get them
away from the hotel

12:47.732 --> 12:49.354
and keep them from finding out
what's going on.

12:49.492 --> 12:51.253
Me? But I barely know
the sales team.

12:51.391 --> 12:53.945
Well, get to know 'em.
We only got... Hey,

12:54.083 --> 12:56.534
-Harry, how long before
we're surrounded?
-Three minutes, tops.

12:56.672 --> 12:58.536
You got three minutes
to get them out the back

12:58.674 --> 13:00.469
-and get gone, okay? Go. Go.
-All right. Yep.

13:00.607 --> 13:03.023
Just keep 'em busy as far away
from the resort as possible.

13:03.161 --> 13:04.714
I repeat, we are under attack.

13:04.853 --> 13:07.096
-Are you talking to the people
with the ATVs?
-What ATVs?

13:07.234 --> 13:09.202
My kids are on an activity
with the ATVS to go see ruins.

13:09.340 --> 13:12.308
-The resort
doesn't have any ATVs.
-What?

13:12.446 --> 13:14.310
Then where are my children?

13:14.448 --> 13:16.416
Where are my children?

13:16.554 --> 13:18.694
Know your customer.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.973
Build relationships.

13:22.111 --> 13:24.044
Uh... synergy.

13:24.182 --> 13:26.702
-ALL: Synergy.
-Hi. Synergy.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.808
-Hey, everybody.
-ALL: Hey.

13:28.946 --> 13:31.327
Corporate sent me here
to lead the sales hike.

13:31.465 --> 13:33.467
-Sales hike?
-Yeah.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.400
And we are way behind.

13:35.538 --> 13:37.471
So we've got to get out there
right now, so everybody up.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.715
-Hold on.
-Uh, uh, so, what if
we don't like hiking?

13:39.853 --> 13:42.131
Okay, I will let corporate know.

13:42.269 --> 13:44.513
But, Rose, you got to get up.
This is a mandatory test

13:44.651 --> 13:47.033
-of team, uh, cohesion.
-[others murmuring]

13:47.171 --> 13:49.069
Okay, we got to get out there
right now. The first test

13:49.207 --> 13:50.415
is how fast you
can get out of here, Don.

13:50.553 --> 13:51.900
So, we've got
ten minutes, Anita.

13:52.038 --> 13:53.591
No, two minutes and ten seconds.

13:53.729 --> 13:55.351
-Two minutes?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.183
Harry, something could have
happened to them.

13:59.321 --> 14:01.185
Just hang on,
we're gonna find them.

14:01.323 --> 14:04.084
Okay, tracking Dana
and Jake's phones, and...

14:04.222 --> 14:06.915
-here, here.
-What is that?

14:07.053 --> 14:09.745
GIB:
Uh, it looks like a bar.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.022
Why would they be at a bar?

14:11.160 --> 14:12.921
Because they're bored
teenagers in Mexico.

14:13.059 --> 14:14.439
Okay, well, we have to get them.

14:14.577 --> 14:15.958
There's nothing I'd rather do,
but to get there

14:16.096 --> 14:17.787
we got to go up that road,
through those guys.

14:17.926 --> 14:19.099
Harry, we're not just
gonna leave them.

14:19.237 --> 14:20.342
We're not going to.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.033
I'm gonna call Luther.
He's close to town.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.519
Helen, it's gonna be okay.
I promise.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.728
[phone ringing]

14:27.867 --> 14:30.248
Hey, what's your status? I'm
heading back as fast as I can.

14:30.386 --> 14:32.285
HARRY:
Change of plans.
We're under attack.

14:32.423 --> 14:34.183
What? It must have
been the guys who hit

14:34.321 --> 14:35.391
our Mexican contacts.
Who are they?

14:35.529 --> 14:37.738
We don't know yet.
Listen, Jake and Dana--

14:37.877 --> 14:38.774
they're out in a bar
by the lake. Gib's gonna

14:38.912 --> 14:39.775
send you the coordinates.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.225
We need you to get them

14:41.363 --> 14:43.192
-and keep them safe.
-Ha-Harry,

14:43.330 --> 14:45.885
I don't have a ton of
hands-on experience with kids.

14:46.023 --> 14:47.093
What do I even say?

14:47.231 --> 14:48.542
Luther, you're a spy.
Make something up.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.234
[scoffs]

15:16.708 --> 15:18.848
[chatter in Spanish]

15:23.129 --> 15:24.682
Okay, I got 20 guys.

15:24.820 --> 15:27.064
I see some AKs,
some machine pistols.

15:27.202 --> 15:28.755
They're spreading out
around the resort.

15:28.893 --> 15:30.343
The place is hardened.
They walls are reinforced

15:30.481 --> 15:31.689
and the windows are bulletproof.

15:31.827 --> 15:33.587
We can slow them down,
but if they come in close,

15:33.725 --> 15:36.142
-we can't hold them off forever.
-Okay,

15:36.280 --> 15:38.282
get to every entrance to the
building, and keep 'em covered.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.455
Eyes on a swivel.

15:39.593 --> 15:41.354
If anyone moves in,
we need to know.

15:41.492 --> 15:43.080
Harry, there are
so many of them.

15:43.218 --> 15:44.081
What are we supposed to do?

15:44.219 --> 15:45.634
Looks like they're setting up

15:45.772 --> 15:47.636
for intersecting fields of fire.

15:47.774 --> 15:48.878
They want us to stay inside.

15:49.017 --> 15:50.363
We're gonna have to
hold them off.

15:50.501 --> 15:52.192
We're gonna have to protect
Omega's intelligence

15:52.330 --> 15:54.367
and preserve our cover.
Hey,

15:54.505 --> 15:55.851
any update on Maria?

15:55.989 --> 15:57.370
Checking in now.

15:58.923 --> 16:01.891
Keep going.
Keep it moving. Yep.

16:04.342 --> 16:06.966
[chatter in Spanish]

16:15.008 --> 16:17.562
Yes. You guys are doing great.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.565
I mean, this is what
it's all about, right?

16:20.703 --> 16:22.153
Taking on new challenges.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.225
Maria, I-I don't have
the shoes for this.

16:25.363 --> 16:28.746
-Maybe they're the perfect
shoes, Brad.
-No.

16:28.884 --> 16:30.955
-Maybe it's about
the mindset, okay?
-[scoffs]

16:31.093 --> 16:32.681
You don't give up
on your clients,

16:32.819 --> 16:34.648
don't give up on
your shoes, right?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.409
-BRAD: That's funny.
-Let's go.

16:36.547 --> 16:38.514
[chatter in Spanish]

16:55.980 --> 16:57.499
Oh, no.

16:57.637 --> 16:59.259
Oh, that's no good.

16:59.397 --> 17:00.916
Who's that?

17:01.054 --> 17:02.573
HARRY:
His name is Jann Isaacs.

17:02.711 --> 17:04.608
He's a spy hunter.

17:04.747 --> 17:06.439
Former Danish intelligence
gone rogue.

17:06.577 --> 17:07.854
Uses his skills
to target officials

17:07.992 --> 17:10.719
in other intelligence agencies.

17:10.857 --> 17:12.031
They must have
gone after the spies

17:12.169 --> 17:13.411
we came here to meet.

17:13.549 --> 17:14.964
If they got their files,
it would've led 'em here.

17:15.103 --> 17:17.001
-What does he want?
-Do you know how much a captured

17:17.138 --> 17:19.071
CIA agent
is worth to North Korea?

17:19.210 --> 17:20.729
Well, what about Omega Sector--
how much are we worth?

17:20.867 --> 17:23.455
-Believe me, we don't want
to find out.
-[phone ringing]

17:23.594 --> 17:25.044
You want me to take it?

17:25.182 --> 17:26.769
No, that's all right.

17:26.906 --> 17:28.288
Put it on speaker.

17:31.257 --> 17:32.741
Las Marianas hotel and resort.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.777
How may I direct your call?

17:34.915 --> 17:36.296
Good afternoon.

17:36.434 --> 17:37.711
As you may have observed,

17:37.849 --> 17:40.300
my men and I are outside.

17:40.438 --> 17:42.785
We are armed, we are serious,

17:42.923 --> 17:45.064
we are here for the spies.

17:45.202 --> 17:47.169
Spies? Uh...

17:47.307 --> 17:49.930
I don't see anyone
by that name in my system.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.209
Is that a first or a last name,
sir? This is a conference...

17:52.347 --> 17:54.763
No, no, don't-don't play games.

17:54.901 --> 17:57.386
Your Mexican friends escaped,

17:57.524 --> 17:59.768
but they left some very
interesting papers behind

17:59.906 --> 18:04.773
and it seems that there are
Omega Sector spies in the area.

18:04.911 --> 18:07.155
And we would very much
like to meet them.

18:07.293 --> 18:08.984
Omega what?
[chuckles]

18:09.122 --> 18:10.330
Uh, sir, I-I don't know...

18:10.468 --> 18:11.952
Don't play games!

18:13.471 --> 18:15.715
Bring them out now

18:15.853 --> 18:18.062
or we will come in and

18:18.200 --> 18:20.340
take them out.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.900
GIB:
Okay, listen.

18:29.038 --> 18:31.386
Say that there are spies here,

18:31.524 --> 18:34.182
um, it's not like they're just
gonna raise their hands

18:34.320 --> 18:36.529
and tell us who they are.
[chuckles]

18:36.667 --> 18:40.084
JANN:
Then we will kill people
one by one

18:40.222 --> 18:42.293
until they identify themselves.

18:42.431 --> 18:44.640
Okay, sir, this is crazy.

18:44.778 --> 18:46.608
This is an established...
Calm down, okay?

18:46.746 --> 18:49.024
Just, don't be ridiculous here.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.406
-[exclaiming]
-GIB: Whoa!

18:55.858 --> 18:57.653
Do you want to keep
your story up?

18:59.276 --> 19:02.141
You have no spies
in a resort that just happens

19:02.279 --> 19:05.868
to have bulletproof windows?
A coincidence, perhaps?

19:06.006 --> 19:08.733
My patience is growing thin.

19:08.871 --> 19:10.321
Okay, all right, man.

19:10.459 --> 19:11.874
Uh, we'll send out the spies.

19:12.012 --> 19:13.738
Just-just give us some time.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.671
Five minutes, no more.

19:17.535 --> 19:18.812
They must be watching
all the roads.

19:18.950 --> 19:19.986
Harry, the kids.

19:20.124 --> 19:20.883
Luther's trained
in evasive tactics.

19:21.021 --> 19:22.851
He'll keep them safe.

19:29.064 --> 19:30.065
Oh, you guys
need to check this out.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.860
Come here, come here.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.833
This is from Brazil last year.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.974
Guy executed six people to find
a single undercover agent.

19:44.907 --> 19:46.426
That's not gonna happen here.

19:46.564 --> 19:48.601
How long do you think we have
to hold them off?

19:48.739 --> 19:51.776
I'd say five, ten minutes
once the shooting starts.

19:51.914 --> 19:53.088
I'll head to the balcony.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.607
Best place to defend
if they come at the front.

19:54.745 --> 19:55.953
Hey. [whistles]

19:56.091 --> 19:57.886
HARRY:
Just keep them back.
I got an idea.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.336
Hey, Harry, you're not
thinking of

19:59.474 --> 20:00.509
taking 'em on directly, are you?

20:00.647 --> 20:01.683
No.
Those guys are locals.

20:01.821 --> 20:03.029
Probably mercenaries
and criminals

20:03.167 --> 20:05.204
that he picked up along the way.

20:05.342 --> 20:08.034
We might be able
to scare 'em off, though.

20:08.172 --> 20:10.036
Do you have any explosives here?

20:10.174 --> 20:11.555
A few planted in the hotel
in case we need to

20:11.693 --> 20:12.832
pull out and destroy
the facility.

20:12.970 --> 20:14.903
Hey, Harry...

20:15.041 --> 20:16.732
are you thinking Sound and Fury?

20:16.870 --> 20:18.734
Unless you got a better idea.

20:21.427 --> 20:22.738
Sound and Fury it is.

20:22.876 --> 20:24.706
What's Sound and Fury?

20:24.844 --> 20:26.259
I'll explain to you on the way.
Come on.

20:26.397 --> 20:29.124
Hey, make sure everyone's
ready to fight. And warn Maria.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.746
Yeah.

20:32.507 --> 20:33.922
What kind of sales training
is this?

20:34.060 --> 20:36.027
It's just... it's just walking.

20:36.165 --> 20:37.581
Just walking.

20:37.719 --> 20:38.823
-Okay, Brad...
-Well, you know what I mean.

20:38.961 --> 20:40.549
-[phone vibrates]
-Sales is about focusing

20:40.687 --> 20:41.999
-on a goal. Hello?
-I...

20:42.137 --> 20:43.552
-GIB: Hey, Maria.
-Hi.

20:43.690 --> 20:45.727
So, uh, things are looking bad.

20:45.865 --> 20:47.901
Awesome.
We're doing great here.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.214
Bonding like you
would not believe.

20:50.352 --> 20:52.596
-It's Jann Isaacs.
-Oh.

20:52.734 --> 20:54.667
He found us through
the Mexican spy delegation.

20:54.805 --> 20:56.082
He's looking to take hostages,

20:56.220 --> 20:58.498
and chances are you've got
men on your tail.

20:58.636 --> 20:59.844
Thanks for letting me know.

20:59.982 --> 21:01.087
All right, look, Maria,
we're not gonna be able

21:01.225 --> 21:03.054
to get out there to help you
anytime soon.

21:03.192 --> 21:04.159
Can you handle this on
your own?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.334
Well, I am

21:06.472 --> 21:08.577
excited for the challenge.

21:08.715 --> 21:11.580
Okay, I got to go.
Good luck, Maria.

21:11.718 --> 21:13.444
Thanks.

21:13.582 --> 21:15.101
That was corporate.

21:15.239 --> 21:17.276
They're really excited
everyone's participating

21:17.414 --> 21:18.346
-in the sales hike.
-[groans]: Oh, man.

21:18.484 --> 21:20.175
They... [whoo]

21:20.313 --> 21:22.902
Just gonna take a selfie

21:23.040 --> 21:24.524
for the newsletter.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.054
Let's go.

21:37.192 --> 21:39.401
-Maria, I have to pee.
-Huh?

21:39.539 --> 21:43.025
Uh, and what would you do
if you had to pee

21:43.163 --> 21:44.130
during a sales call?

21:44.268 --> 21:45.994
Go?

21:46.995 --> 21:49.549
Or you hold it,

21:49.687 --> 21:52.241
because nothing
is more important than a sale.

21:52.380 --> 21:55.072
Right? I-It's the...
it's the journey there.

21:55.210 --> 21:58.731
So we're just gonna keep moving
and think dry thoughts.

21:58.869 --> 22:00.629
Sound and Fury
is a psyops tactic.

22:00.767 --> 22:03.425
We use it when we're
outnumbered. Basically, the idea

22:03.563 --> 22:05.910
is to trick the opposing force
into retreating.

22:06.048 --> 22:07.291
HELEN:
So that's what
the explosives are for?

22:07.429 --> 22:08.672
HARRY:
Exactly.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.674
The C-4 looks like Play-Doh
and has an electric

22:10.812 --> 22:11.744
-thingy in it?
-Yeah, that's it.

22:11.882 --> 22:13.815
-That's it.
-Oh, okay.

22:13.953 --> 22:15.195
The goal here is just
to stay out of sight,

22:15.334 --> 22:17.094
make 'em think that
there's a bunch of us

22:17.232 --> 22:19.338
and then hopefully scare them
into retreating.

22:22.237 --> 22:23.238
Okay, so everybody
goes out there and...

22:23.376 --> 22:25.171
Not everybody.
Just me.

22:25.309 --> 22:26.862
Excuse me?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.968
Harry, you're going alone?

22:30.383 --> 22:32.385
Ugh. This sucks.

22:32.523 --> 22:34.767
We could have gone Jet Skiing
on the water,

22:34.905 --> 22:36.424
but you wanted to go
and try and buy beer.

22:36.562 --> 22:38.771
Three bars and zero beers.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.083
Okay, who knew Mexican
bartenders could tell

22:41.221 --> 22:42.533
a fake ID from Maryland?

22:42.671 --> 22:44.777
If you paid a little
more attention in Spanish class,

22:44.915 --> 22:46.330
you could have convinced them.

22:46.468 --> 22:47.435
I mean, what did you say
to that one guy?

22:47.573 --> 22:50.955
"I drink allowed.
Very old."

22:51.093 --> 22:52.888
Okay, well, it doesn't
make me look any older

22:53.026 --> 22:53.889
when you stand there
looking like

22:54.027 --> 22:55.201
you're about to pee your pants.

22:55.339 --> 22:56.513
-I wasn't gonna...
-LUTHER: Hey, guys.

22:56.651 --> 22:58.446
Ha!

22:58.584 --> 23:01.552
Dana and Jake Tasker.
The Taskeritos.

23:01.690 --> 23:04.037
That doesn't sound good
when I say it.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.971
This... What are...
This is fun,

23:07.109 --> 23:09.388
that I just bumped into you guys

23:09.526 --> 23:11.251
like this by accident.
I, uh...

23:11.390 --> 23:12.632
What are you guy...
what are you doing?

23:12.770 --> 23:14.738
Uh, hey. Uh, nothing.
We weren't, uh...

23:14.876 --> 23:16.567
What are you doing here?

23:16.705 --> 23:18.742
Aren't you supposed to
be doing, like, sales stuff?

23:18.880 --> 23:21.814
[scoffs]
I mean, whatever. Sales.

23:21.952 --> 23:23.919
I'm just, like, so over it.
You know?

23:24.057 --> 23:25.576
I just want to, like, get out,

23:25.714 --> 23:27.854
see the sights, have some fun.

23:29.511 --> 23:30.478
Here's an idea.

23:32.169 --> 23:33.481
Taco crawl.

23:34.516 --> 23:36.345
Taco crawl?

23:37.554 --> 23:40.349
Yeah, we were actually

23:40.488 --> 23:42.317
-about to just
walk back or whatever.
-JAKE: Yeah. Yeah.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.423
Come on, guys, tacos.

23:44.561 --> 23:47.080
-Who doesn't love tacos?
-I am kind of hungry, so...

23:47.218 --> 23:48.737
Okay, well,
you're always hungry.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.946
Settled.
We're going to get tacos.

23:51.084 --> 23:52.431
All right?
I know this great place.

23:52.569 --> 23:55.606
It's... Where it is
is down... There... It's...

23:55.744 --> 23:58.264
Um, I know it
when we get in the car.

23:58.402 --> 23:59.921
Been there a lot.

24:00.059 --> 24:03.027
We need to find some way
out of the building for Harry.

24:03.165 --> 24:05.202
Someplace where
he won't be seen.

24:05.340 --> 24:07.204
Well, there are some windows
on the east side.

24:07.342 --> 24:09.862
GIB:
I need something with cover.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.657
The utility room.

24:11.795 --> 24:13.728
There's an access grate.
It goes through those bushes.

24:15.005 --> 24:16.213
GIB:
Yes!

24:16.351 --> 24:19.768
Yes, this is perfect.
I could ki-kiss you...

24:19.906 --> 24:21.529
Oh, Tomas!

24:21.667 --> 24:23.220
Hey, how we looking out there?

24:23.358 --> 24:25.705
Guys, we have a problem.
I think they're done waiting.

24:25.843 --> 24:27.811
[shouting in Spanish]

24:29.571 --> 24:31.987
Move! Move!

24:32.850 --> 24:33.920
[gasps]

24:41.790 --> 24:43.343
HELEN:
Harry, I don't understand.
How can it

24:43.482 --> 24:44.897
possibly work for you
to go out there alone?

24:45.035 --> 24:46.312
Well, the same way
it worked in Lebanon,

24:46.450 --> 24:47.658
Somalia and Haiti.

24:47.796 --> 24:50.247
So, I've got about a dozen
explosive charges.

24:50.385 --> 24:51.386
How we coming
on those detonators?

24:51.524 --> 24:53.077
I did the best I could.
They're all

24:53.215 --> 24:54.354
-on different channels.
-It'll have to do.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.702
And what kind of tactical gear
do we have?

24:56.840 --> 24:58.462
There's a small armory,
but there's just the basics.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.844
-[gunfire continuing]
-Ah.

25:03.536 --> 25:04.675
They're coming in, guys.

25:04.813 --> 25:06.401
All right, Harry.
Let's rock and roll, baby.

25:06.539 --> 25:09.369
-It's go time.
-Let's go.

25:16.376 --> 25:17.585
GIB:
Tomas,

25:17.723 --> 25:20.001
two coming in
on the west side, on your right.

25:20.139 --> 25:22.244
East side, I got two more
trying to get in

25:22.382 --> 25:24.315
along the wall.

25:24.453 --> 25:26.628
No, H-Helen, I don't need that.

25:26.766 --> 25:28.457
Thank you so much, but I have
a way of doing things.

25:28.596 --> 25:30.390
Harry, I'm just trying to make
sure that you have everything

25:30.529 --> 25:32.772
that you need. Remember
during our honeymoon,

25:32.910 --> 25:34.394
-you forgot your toothbrush.?
-Yeah... Toothbrush?

25:34.533 --> 25:36.604
-Uh-huh.
-Gib, what's my approach?

25:36.742 --> 25:38.778
Utility room grate.
East side. Go.

25:38.916 --> 25:41.160
Okay. No, I don't need that.
Thank you so much.

25:55.899 --> 25:57.452
So, they were married before
she worked for Omega?

25:57.590 --> 25:58.902
[chuckles]
Yeah.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.904
Yeah, then he blew his cover
and they brought her in.

26:01.042 --> 26:03.907
Tomas, two more,
coming up on your left.

26:06.116 --> 26:08.428
That's sweet
that they work together.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.154
You think it's sweet?
I'm worried that they're

26:10.292 --> 26:12.260
-gonna kill each other.
-Well, it's not
always comfortable

26:12.398 --> 26:13.917
bringing in someone new.
Sofia,

26:14.055 --> 26:15.263
11 o'clock!

26:15.401 --> 26:18.991
But it can be good.
New energy, new ideas.

26:19.129 --> 26:21.510
Speaking of,
I think we can hack

26:21.649 --> 26:23.374
the radio frequencies
of the guys outside.

26:23.512 --> 26:26.239
-You can? Seriously?
-Yeah.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.482
We can slip in some
disinformation

26:27.620 --> 26:28.759
when Harry's ready.

26:28.897 --> 26:30.002
Make them believe
they're outnumbered.

26:30.140 --> 26:31.348
Get them to retreat.

26:31.486 --> 26:33.143
That's a... that's
an amazing idea.

26:33.281 --> 26:34.213
[chuckles softly]

26:34.351 --> 26:36.284
-[loud explosion]
-BOTH: Aah!

26:37.285 --> 26:38.769
Uh, Ramon, Sofia,

26:38.907 --> 26:39.943
I need you guys to concentrate

26:40.081 --> 26:41.254
your fire on the two units

26:41.392 --> 26:43.602
moving along
the wall on the west side.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.120
[explosion in distance]

26:45.258 --> 26:47.398
Wha-What...
What are all those noises?

26:47.536 --> 26:49.677
-Those?
-Yeah.

26:49.815 --> 26:51.195
They're the fireworks.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.612
And why are there fireworks?

26:53.750 --> 26:56.442
Um, the festival.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.099
In town.

26:58.237 --> 27:00.549
Uh, Festival del Arte.

27:00.688 --> 27:02.379
It's-it's a big thing.
It's a big deal.

27:02.517 --> 27:05.554
Well, are-are we
gonna stop soon? I mean,

27:05.693 --> 27:08.040
look, the people--
they're-they're tired.

27:08.178 --> 27:10.180
-Uh-huh.
-And we didn't bring any water.

27:10.318 --> 27:11.699
And I still have to pee.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.873
Okay, well,
Rose can't have any water,

27:14.011 --> 27:14.874
-right? And...
-Uh, but...

27:15.012 --> 27:17.152
We'll stop soon.
Pretty soon.

27:17.290 --> 27:18.706
-I think it's just up there.
-But...

27:18.844 --> 27:21.225
Just, we've just got
to keep going, okay?

27:21.363 --> 27:22.882
-Okay.
-You're doing great.

27:23.020 --> 27:24.712
Keep going, keep going.

27:24.850 --> 27:27.611
Doing great. Keep going.

27:39.312 --> 27:41.280
Not gonna get away like this.

27:47.148 --> 27:49.909
Wait! Harry.

27:50.047 --> 27:51.635
-I'm going with you.
-What are...

27:51.773 --> 27:53.085
what are you talking about?

27:53.223 --> 27:54.327
I'm going out there with you.
I'm not gonna let you

27:54.465 --> 27:55.984
-go out there alone.
-No. Absolutely not.

27:56.122 --> 27:57.365
It's too dangerous.

27:57.503 --> 27:59.505
Too dangerous?
Harry, if this doesn't work out,

27:59.643 --> 28:00.817
those guys out there
are gonna come in here

28:00.955 --> 28:02.266
and I'm gonna be
in danger anyways.

28:02.404 --> 28:04.406
Okay, look, look, the whole
point of Sound and Fury

28:04.544 --> 28:05.649
is to be invisible, stealthy.

28:05.787 --> 28:07.030
Two people can be stealthy.

28:07.168 --> 28:08.997
Remember when we used to
sneak into the kids' room

28:09.135 --> 28:10.412
and put money underneath
their pillows?

28:10.550 --> 28:11.586
That was one of us, right?

28:11.724 --> 28:13.105
People weren't shooting at us

28:13.243 --> 28:14.451
when we were playing
the tooth fairy, Harry!

28:14.589 --> 28:17.765
All I'm saying is I've
done this before, Helen.

28:17.903 --> 28:19.456
There's a way I do things.

28:19.594 --> 28:21.423
Well, it's not always
the best way.

28:21.561 --> 28:22.770
Helen, you cannot come in here

28:22.908 --> 28:24.219
and change everything.

28:24.357 --> 28:25.945
I'm not trying
to change everything.

28:26.083 --> 28:27.188
But you can't cut me out.

28:27.326 --> 28:28.776
I'm part of this team, too.

28:28.914 --> 28:30.605
You have your chest plate,
a gun,

28:30.743 --> 28:32.193
multiple packs of C-4,

28:32.331 --> 28:33.781
and I don't even know
how many detonators

28:33.919 --> 28:35.058
in the same bag.

28:35.196 --> 28:37.060
You think you're gonna
keep that all organized?

28:37.198 --> 28:38.958
You don't think I could be
a little bit helpful?

28:39.096 --> 28:42.721
Okay, okay, it could
possibly be helpful

28:42.859 --> 28:45.240
if somebody handled detonators.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.073
Then I'll handle the detonators.

28:56.217 --> 28:58.253
[gunfire continuing in distance]

29:02.637 --> 29:05.985
So, what's up with you
skipping out

29:06.123 --> 29:08.747
on all the sales stuff
this afternoon to go to the bar?

29:08.885 --> 29:11.404
Dad always talks about how
you're, like, Mr. Sales.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.579
Does he?

29:13.717 --> 29:15.926
I guess I do have
a bit of a reputation.

29:16.064 --> 29:17.514
No doubt.

29:17.652 --> 29:18.998
I mean, Dad has this really
funny impression of you.

29:19.136 --> 29:22.174
-Remember?
-Yeah.

29:22.312 --> 29:23.520
I know. "Hey, baby,

29:23.658 --> 29:25.764
"computers are what
brings the world together.

29:25.902 --> 29:27.938
-Hey." Yeah.
-It's not quite like that.

29:28.076 --> 29:29.837
It's not as funny
when you do it.

29:29.975 --> 29:31.528
Eh...

29:31.666 --> 29:34.358
So, uh, where, exactly,
is this taco place?

29:34.496 --> 29:36.844
Um, I don't know
exactly where it is,

29:36.982 --> 29:37.983
but it's here somewhere.

29:38.121 --> 29:39.778
DANA:
Okay, well, it's kind of weird

29:39.916 --> 29:41.434
that someone would
sell tacos out here

29:41.572 --> 29:43.747
-rather than by the lake.
-It's not weird.
It's not weird.

29:43.885 --> 29:45.611
It's Mexico. They just...

29:45.749 --> 29:46.923
They do things a little
differently down here.

29:47.061 --> 29:49.373
Um, guys, I think
that Jeep's following us.

29:51.272 --> 29:52.687
DANA:
I think they want you
to pull over.

29:52.825 --> 29:53.964
JAKE:
Is that a gun?

29:54.102 --> 29:57.140
Guns?
Why do they have guns?

29:57.278 --> 29:58.348
Probably the police.
Obviously you were trying

29:58.486 --> 29:59.383
to buy beer earlier.

29:59.521 --> 30:00.557
You think the beer police is

30:00.695 --> 30:02.490
-chasing us with guns?
-Yes.

30:02.628 --> 30:05.148
Hey, guys, you ever try to, um,

30:05.286 --> 30:07.253
outrun the cops?

30:07.391 --> 30:08.461
What?

30:08.599 --> 30:10.291
Let's get crazy.
Let's do it.

30:10.429 --> 30:11.430
[gasps]

30:13.190 --> 30:14.571
What are you doing?

30:14.709 --> 30:16.331
What do you think,
I'm just a-a sales guy

30:16.469 --> 30:18.161
that's never run
from the cops before?

30:20.025 --> 30:22.165
-You've done this before?
-Sure.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.242
[gunfire in distance]

30:30.380 --> 30:33.245
GIB: Okay, Team Tasker,
you're gonna plant
those charges

30:33.383 --> 30:35.109
in the trees behind the gunmen.

30:35.247 --> 30:38.491
Then, on my go, you're gonna
light up those boxes of ammo

30:38.629 --> 30:39.768
and lure them back toward you.

31:00.065 --> 31:01.583
Tomas, they're trying the lobby,

31:01.721 --> 31:02.861
straight ahead.

31:09.764 --> 31:12.629
Harry, you are 78 yards
west of the tree line.

31:12.767 --> 31:14.734
-Helen.
-Helen, you're slipping.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.460
Speed up, speed up.
Okay, stay low, guys.

31:16.598 --> 31:17.806
They're-they're
right in front of you.

31:17.945 --> 31:19.705
Ramon, you got two creeping up
on you right now.

31:19.843 --> 31:21.500
Your east side.
That is your right side.

31:30.164 --> 31:31.234
[groans]

31:31.372 --> 31:32.373
Tomas, what happened?

31:32.511 --> 31:34.237
I'm hit, but I'm okay.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.412
Guys, keep firing.
Keep firing.

31:37.550 --> 31:40.070
We got this.
I'll go get Tomas.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.727

31:41.865 --> 31:44.557
Hey, Harry, we're down
a man over here. You ready?

31:44.695 --> 31:46.180
I guess we'll have to be.

[laughs]

32:02.161 --> 32:04.923
Enough? Oh, baby,
we're just getting started.

32:05.061 --> 32:06.752
What kind of game
do you think you're playing?

32:06.890 --> 32:09.030
Omega Sector doesn't play games.

32:09.168 --> 32:10.583
Why do you think you've
never captured one of us?

32:10.721 --> 32:13.241
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

32:13.379 --> 32:15.519
You don't think I know a bluff
when I hear one?

32:15.657 --> 32:17.866
We shot your man on the balcony.
We're coming in.

32:18.005 --> 32:20.248
Oh, don't bother.
We'll come to you.

32:20.386 --> 32:21.905
Harry,

32:22.043 --> 32:24.356
you're up.
Make some noise.

You want to be taken
alive or dead?

I'd rather take you alive,
since your corpse

Uh, hey.

39:21.704 --> 39:25.052
So, uh, I just... I-I just
wanted to-to let you know

39:25.190 --> 39:27.295
how incredible you were today.

39:27.434 --> 39:31.196
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm just doing my job.

39:31.334 --> 39:33.612
Yeah, but it's a job
that I do solo,

39:33.750 --> 39:36.719
and today I was a little bit
better because of you.

39:36.857 --> 39:38.030
-Really?
-Really.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.031
-Wow.
-Yeah.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.034
Um... you're welcome.

39:42.172 --> 39:44.071
[both chuckle]

39:44.209 --> 39:47.626
So, um, about that dance, you...

39:47.764 --> 39:50.215
Oh, uh...

39:50.353 --> 39:52.666
I thought you would never ask.

39:52.804 --> 39:55.496
Oh.

39:57.256 --> 39:58.568
Hi.

39:58.706 --> 40:00.639
Mom, why do you keep
hugging us?

40:01.709 --> 40:03.918
Because I missed you

40:04.056 --> 40:05.920
when you were at the ATV thingy.

40:06.058 --> 40:09.993
And you know, moms
loving their kids and stuff.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.719
There's Maria.
I'm gonna go dance with her.

40:11.857 --> 40:13.583
Okay.

40:13.721 --> 40:14.998
Love you.

40:15.136 --> 40:18.208
["No Me Aguanto" by Mike Jiminez
playing]

40:18.346 --> 40:20.348
Love you.

40:27.977 --> 40:29.565
Want to dance?

40:29.703 --> 40:31.325
[laughs]
Yes.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.154
Oh, but first,

40:33.292 --> 40:34.949
I have a confession.

40:36.710 --> 40:39.782
I might have...

40:39.920 --> 40:41.162
given your lucky knife

40:41.300 --> 40:42.405
to the Goodwill.

40:42.543 --> 40:44.269
Helen.

40:44.407 --> 40:46.236
There were two boxes.

40:46.374 --> 40:47.514
One was for old tools

40:47.652 --> 40:48.860
and then the other one
was for donations

40:48.998 --> 40:51.241
and I think I put your
lucky knife in that box.

40:51.379 --> 40:52.622
[sighs]

40:52.760 --> 40:54.624
That's okay.
It's okay.

40:54.762 --> 40:57.282
-I'll just get another wife...
Knife. Knife.
-Oh.

40:57.420 --> 40:58.939
[laughs]:
Okay.

40:59.077 --> 41:01.079
You saved everyone today.

41:01.217 --> 41:03.495
We saved everyone.

41:04.531 --> 41:06.533
So you really didn't like
sharing a toothbrush

41:06.671 --> 41:09.259
-on our honeymoon?
-No.

41:09.397 --> 41:10.709
That's disgusting.
Harry.

41:10.847 --> 41:12.746
Oh, okay.
So, then you'll agree that

41:12.884 --> 41:15.645
maybe sometimes you shouldn't
mess with other people's stuff.

41:15.783 --> 41:17.820
[laughs]
