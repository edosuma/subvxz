08:53.602 --> 08:55.707
I was just trying
to keep up the cover story.

08:55.845 --> 08:57.606
Have you seen Brad bowl?

08:58.572 --> 09:00.401
I've seen him dance.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.715
Hey, Gib.

09:03.853 --> 09:04.716
You like the cocktails?

09:04.854 --> 09:06.960
-Hey. Eva.
-[laughs]

09:07.098 --> 09:08.513
Uh, yeah. Oh, they're great.

09:08.651 --> 09:11.136
You know, you do a wonderful job

09:11.274 --> 09:12.966
putting this conference
together every year.

09:13.104 --> 09:14.070
-[chuckles]
-Really. No, really.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.658
Thank you. Well...

09:15.796 --> 09:17.971
well, the administrative stuff
isn't all that exciting,

09:18.109 --> 09:19.800
-but...
-[chuckles]

09:21.146 --> 09:23.148
I-I just wanted
to let you know I handled all

09:23.286 --> 09:25.668
the pre-contact
reports with Omega.

09:27.705 --> 09:29.569
Uh, you didn't have to...

09:29.707 --> 09:31.709
-Wow. Wow.
-[laughs] Yeah.

09:31.847 --> 09:34.159
-[chuckles]
-Well, it's no problem.

09:34.297 --> 09:38.370
I... I just wanted you
to have a little free time.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.477
Maybe, you know...

09:41.615 --> 09:42.892
dance a little?

09:43.030 --> 09:46.378
-No. Uh, that's nice,
but, uh, uh...
-Oh.

09:46.516 --> 09:48.242
You know, I, um...

09:48.380 --> 09:49.727
I should probably go
double-check those reports.

09:49.865 --> 09:50.900
-Oh.
-It's-it's get...

09:51.038 --> 09:52.177
-Hey.
-Wow.

09:52.315 --> 09:53.247
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.111
-All right. See you.
-Okay. Bye.

10:06.226 --> 10:07.883
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
make you some hot cocoa,

10:08.021 --> 10:12.301
and then you guys are gonna have
a fun day with big activities.

10:13.509 --> 10:17.030
If I can just get
this thing open.

10:17.168 --> 10:18.687
Just cut it.
I mean, where's your knife?

10:18.825 --> 10:21.413
[grunts] I'm not sure.
Ask your mom.

10:22.829 --> 10:23.864
-Oh...
-JAKE [chuckles]: Oh, nice.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.970
Man, I got to snap this.

10:26.108 --> 10:27.385
-Jake, come on.
-[shutter clicks]
-DANA: Okay,

10:27.523 --> 10:28.351
forget it. We're gonna be late.

10:28.489 --> 10:30.043
Late for what?

10:30.181 --> 10:31.838
The, uh...
the ATV thing.

10:31.976 --> 10:33.633
-To some ruins.
Supposed to be really great.
-Oh.

10:33.771 --> 10:36.118
Ooh.
ATVing to some ruins.

10:36.256 --> 10:38.534
Those guys have the right idea.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.225
-[door closes]
-All right,

10:40.363 --> 10:41.951
we should go to the pre-meeting
briefing with the Omega team.

10:42.089 --> 10:44.402
Absolutely.
But I need to change my shirt.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.231
We don't have to be down there
for another half hour anyway.

10:46.369 --> 10:47.785
Oh, that's what you say
whenever we go to the airport,

10:47.923 --> 10:48.786
and we're always late.

10:48.924 --> 10:50.165
Honey, I'm a spy.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.547
-I'm also a spy.
-I know you are.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.480
But I've been to these meetings

10:53.618 --> 10:55.896
-a-a lot of times.
-Hon, I think, well,

10:56.034 --> 10:57.657
there's always room
for improvement.

10:57.795 --> 11:00.590
Ho-ho-ho.
Look who's early.

11:00.729 --> 11:02.903
Helen, you area good influence.
Usually, we're waiting

11:03.041 --> 11:04.077
-on this guy.
-Oh.

11:04.215 --> 11:05.423
-Okay.
-Huh.

11:05.561 --> 11:07.252
[chuckles]
He didn't say I was late.

11:07.390 --> 11:09.323
[clears throat]
You smell delicious.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.360
Is that cocoa?

11:11.498 --> 11:12.844
It's cocoa powder.
I told you that I should have

11:12.982 --> 11:14.018
-changed my shirt.
-GIB: Hey, guys, let's focus.

11:14.156 --> 11:15.433
Focus up.

11:15.571 --> 11:17.677
Eva and her team did a great job
prepping for the meeting.

11:17.815 --> 11:19.471
She's gonna go over details.

11:19.609 --> 11:20.818
We've got a window of two hours

11:20.956 --> 11:22.889
while the sales team
is at a training.

11:23.027 --> 11:26.099
-Tomas is head of security.
He prepped the meeting site.
-It's an old house

11:26.237 --> 11:27.859
on the north side of the lake.
The official story

11:27.997 --> 11:30.586
is it's a congratulations
lunch for Luther Tenet.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.381
While you guys are out,
Ramon, Sofia

11:32.519 --> 11:34.348
and I--
we'll hold down the fort here.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.005
Luther's doing a security sweep

11:36.143 --> 11:37.179
with the Mexican delegation
right now.

11:37.317 --> 11:38.283
When he gives us the all clear,

11:38.421 --> 11:39.526
we'll head that direction.

11:39.664 --> 11:41.010
-[phone vibrates]
Till then, we'll... Oh.

11:41.148 --> 11:42.563
Well, look at that.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.531
Hey, right on time, man.
We were just talking about you.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.740
We're all set here, so
if everything's good with you,

11:46.878 --> 11:48.777
-we'll just, uh...
-Well, everything
is definitely not good.

11:48.915 --> 11:50.192
What?
What's going on?

11:50.330 --> 11:51.503
I don't know.
It looks like someone rolled up

11:51.641 --> 11:52.815
on the Mexican delegation

11:52.953 --> 11:55.300
and they bailed out of here
in a big hurry.

11:55.438 --> 11:57.233
The delegation torched
all the files they could,

11:57.371 --> 12:00.236
and they got away,
but this place has been tossed.

12:00.374 --> 12:01.962
Okay, that's bad. That's, uh...
that's-that's really bad.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.757
Bad? What's bad?

12:03.895 --> 12:05.966
I'm not sure yet. Harry,
can you get eyes on the road?

12:06.104 --> 12:08.693
So, let me get this straight.
There was no message,

12:08.831 --> 12:10.074
no note, no nothing?

12:10.212 --> 12:12.352
Gib, I'm telling you,
these guys are gone.

12:19.635 --> 12:21.326
GIB:
If that place got searched,
then we could be compromised.

12:21.464 --> 12:23.259
There's no "if" about it, Gib.

12:24.813 --> 12:27.816
Armed forces on their way.
Guys, we're under attack.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.338
-Eva, Eva, Eva.
-Yes?

12:33.476 --> 12:35.064
We need to make sure
that all the kids

12:35.202 --> 12:36.756
and the spouses out
on activities stay away.

12:36.894 --> 12:37.998
On it.

12:38.136 --> 12:39.344
Hey, Sofia, Ramon,
check the common areas.

12:39.482 --> 12:41.415
Make sure we don't have
any stragglers

12:41.553 --> 12:42.900
-roaming the premises.
-GIB: Hey, Maria,

12:43.038 --> 12:44.764
the sales team
is in their breakout session

12:44.902 --> 12:46.075
in the conference wing.

12:46.213 --> 12:47.594
Okay, you got to get them
away from the hotel

12:47.732 --> 12:49.354
and keep them from finding out
what's going on.

12:49.492 --> 12:51.253
Me? But I barely know
the sales team.

12:51.391 --> 12:53.945
Well, get to know 'em.
We only got... Hey,

12:54.083 --> 12:56.534
-Harry, how long before
we're surrounded?
-Three minutes, tops.

12:56.672 --> 12:58.536
You got three minutes
to get them out the back

12:58.674 --> 13:00.469
-and get gone, okay? Go. Go.
-All right. Yep.

13:00.607 --> 13:03.023
Just keep 'em busy as far away
from the resort as possible.

13:03.161 --> 13:04.714
I repeat, we are under attack.

13:04.853 --> 13:07.096
-Are you talking to the people
with the ATVs?
-What ATVs?

13:07.234 --> 13:09.202
My kids are on an activity
with the ATVS to go see ruins.

13:09.340 --> 13:12.308
-The resort
doesn't have any ATVs.
-What?

13:12.446 --> 13:14.310
Then where are my children?

13:14.448 --> 13:16.416
Where are my children?

13:16.554 --> 13:18.694
Know your customer.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.973
Build relationships.

13:22.111 --> 13:24.044
Uh... synergy.

13:24.182 --> 13:26.702
-ALL: Synergy.
-Hi. Synergy.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.808
-Hey, everybody.
-ALL: Hey.

13:28.946 --> 13:31.327
Corporate sent me here
to lead the sales hike.

13:31.465 --> 13:33.467
-Sales hike?
-Yeah.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.400
And we are way behind.

13:35.538 --> 13:37.471
So we've got to get out there
right now, so everybody up.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.715
-Hold on.
-Uh, uh, so, what if
we don't like hiking?

13:39.853 --> 13:42.131
Okay, I will let corporate know.

13:42.269 --> 13:44.513
But, Rose, you got to get up.
This is a mandatory test

13:44.651 --> 13:47.033
-of team, uh, cohesion.
-[others murmuring]

13:47.171 --> 13:49.069
Okay, we got to get out there
right now. The first test

13:49.207 --> 13:50.415
is how fast you
can get out of here, Don.

13:50.553 --> 13:51.900
So, we've got
ten minutes, Anita.

13:52.038 --> 13:53.591
No, two minutes and ten seconds.

13:53.729 --> 13:55.351
-Two minutes?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.183
Harry, something could have
happened to them.

13:59.321 --> 14:01.185
Just hang on,
we're gonna find them.

14:01.323 --> 14:04.084
Okay, tracking Dana
and Jake's phones, and...

14:04.222 --> 14:06.915
-here, here.
-What is that?

14:07.053 --> 14:09.745
GIB:
Uh, it looks like a bar.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.022
Why would they be at a bar?

14:11.160 --> 14:12.921
Because they're bored
teenagers in Mexico.

14:13.059 --> 14:14.439
Okay, well, we have to get them.

14:14.577 --> 14:15.958
There's nothing I'd rather do,
but to get there

14:16.096 --> 14:17.787
we got to go up that road,
through those guys.

14:17.926 --> 14:19.099
Harry, we're not just
gonna leave them.

14:19.237 --> 14:20.342
We're not going to.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.033
I'm gonna call Luther.
He's close to town.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.519
Helen, it's gonna be okay.
I promise.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.728
[phone ringing]

14:27.867 --> 14:30.248
Hey, what's your status? I'm
heading back as fast as I can.

14:30.386 --> 14:32.285
HARRY:
Change of plans.
We're under attack.

14:32.423 --> 14:34.183
What? It must have
been the guys who hit

14:34.321 --> 14:35.391
our Mexican contacts.
Who are they?

14:35.529 --> 14:37.738
We don't know yet.
Listen, Jake and Dana--

14:37.877 --> 14:38.774
they're out in a bar
by the lake. Gib's gonna

14:38.912 --> 14:39.775
send you the coordinates.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.225
We need you to get them

14:41.363 --> 14:43.192
-and keep them safe.
-Ha-Harry,

14:43.330 --> 14:45.885
I don't have a ton of
hands-on experience with kids.

14:46.023 --> 14:47.093
What do I even say?

14:47.231 --> 14:48.542
Luther, you're a spy.
Make something up.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.234
[scoffs]

15:16.708 --> 15:18.848
[chatter in Spanish]

15:23.129 --> 15:24.682
Okay, I got 20 guys.

15:24.820 --> 15:27.064
I see some AKs,
some machine pistols.

15:27.202 --> 15:28.755
They're spreading out
around the resort.

15:28.893 --> 15:30.343
The place is hardened.
They walls are reinforced

15:30.481 --> 15:31.689
and the windows are bulletproof.

15:31.827 --> 15:33.587
We can slow them down,
but if they come in close,

15:33.725 --> 15:36.142
-we can't hold them off forever.
-Okay,

15:36.280 --> 15:38.282
get to every entrance to the
building, and keep 'em covered.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.455
Eyes on a swivel.

15:39.593 --> 15:41.354
If anyone moves in,
we need to know.

15:41.492 --> 15:43.080
Harry, there are
so many of them.

15:43.218 --> 15:44.081
What are we supposed to do?

15:44.219 --> 15:45.634
Looks like they're setting up

15:45.772 --> 15:47.636
for intersecting fields of fire.

15:47.774 --> 15:48.878
They want us to stay inside.

15:49.017 --> 15:50.363
We're gonna have to
hold them off.

15:50.501 --> 15:52.192
We're gonna have to protect
Omega's intelligence

15:52.330 --> 15:54.367
and preserve our cover.
Hey,

15:54.505 --> 15:55.851
any update on Maria?

15:55.989 --> 15:57.370
Checking in now.

15:58.923 --> 16:01.891
Keep going.
Keep it moving. Yep.

16:04.342 --> 16:06.966
[chatter in Spanish]

16:15.008 --> 16:17.562
Yes. You guys are doing great.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.565
I mean, this is what
it's all about, right?

16:20.703 --> 16:22.153
Taking on new challenges.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.225
Maria, I-I don't have
the shoes for this.

16:25.363 --> 16:28.746
-Maybe they're the perfect
shoes, Brad.
-No.

16:28.884 --> 16:30.955
-Maybe it's about
the mindset, okay?
-[scoffs]

16:31.093 --> 16:32.681
You don't give up
on your clients,

16:32.819 --> 16:34.648
don't give up on
your shoes, right?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.409
-BRAD: That's funny.
-Let's go.

16:36.547 --> 16:38.514
[chatter in Spanish]

16:55.980 --> 16:57.499
Oh, no.

16:57.637 --> 16:59.259
Oh, that's no good.

16:59.397 --> 17:00.916
Who's that?

17:01.054 --> 17:02.573
HARRY:
His name is Jann Isaacs.

17:02.711 --> 17:04.608
He's a spy hunter.

17:04.747 --> 17:06.439
Former Danish intelligence
gone rogue.

17:06.577 --> 17:07.854
Uses his skills
to target officials

17:07.992 --> 17:10.719
in other intelligence agencies.

17:10.857 --> 17:12.031
They must have
gone after the spies

17:12.169 --> 17:13.411
we came here to meet.

17:13.549 --> 17:14.964
If they got their files,
it would've led 'em here.

17:15.103 --> 17:17.001
-What does he want?
-Do you know how much a captured

17:17.138 --> 17:19.071
CIA agent
is worth to North Korea?

17:19.210 --> 17:20.729
Well, what about Omega Sector--
how much are we worth?

17:20.867 --> 17:23.455
-Believe me, we don't want
to find out.
-[phone ringing]

17:23.594 --> 17:25.044
You want me to take it?

17:25.182 --> 17:26.769
No, that's all right.

17:26.906 --> 17:28.288
Put it on speaker.

17:31.257 --> 17:32.741
Las Marianas hotel and resort.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.777
How may I direct your call?

17:34.915 --> 17:36.296
Good afternoon.

17:36.434 --> 17:37.711
As you may have observed,

17:37.849 --> 17:40.300
my men and I are outside.

17:40.438 --> 17:42.785
We are armed, we are serious,

17:42.923 --> 17:45.064
we are here for the spies.

17:45.202 --> 17:47.169
Spies? Uh...

17:47.307 --> 17:49.930
I don't see anyone
by that name in my system.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.209
Is that a first or a last name,
sir? This is a conference...

17:52.347 --> 17:54.763
No, no, don't-don't play games.

17:54.901 --> 17:57.386
Your Mexican friends escaped,

17:57.524 --> 17:59.768
but they left some very
interesting papers behind

17:59.906 --> 18:04.773
and it seems that there are
Omega Sector spies in the area.

18:04.911 --> 18:07.155
And we would very much
like to meet them.

18:07.293 --> 18:08.984
Omega what?
[chuckles]

18:09.122 --> 18:10.330
Uh, sir, I-I don't know...

18:10.468 --> 18:11.952
Don't play games!

18:13.471 --> 18:15.715
Bring them out now

18:15.853 --> 18:18.062
or we will come in and

18:18.200 --> 18:20.340
take them out.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.900
GIB:
Okay, listen.

18:29.038 --> 18:31.386
Say that there are spies here,

18:31.524 --> 18:34.182
um, it's not like they're just
gonna raise their hands

18:34.320 --> 18:36.529
and tell us who they are.
[chuckles]

18:36.667 --> 18:40.084
JANN:
Then we will kill people
one by one

18:40.222 --> 18:42.293
until they identify themselves.

18:42.431 --> 18:44.640
Okay, sir, this is crazy.

18:44.778 --> 18:46.608
This is an established...
Calm down, okay?

18:46.746 --> 18:49.024
Just, don't be ridiculous here.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.406
-[exclaiming]
-GIB: Whoa!

18:55.858 --> 18:57.653
Do you want to keep
your story up?

18:59.276 --> 19:02.141
You have no spies
in a resort that just happens

19:02.279 --> 19:05.868
to have bulletproof windows?
A coincidence, perhaps?

19:06.006 --> 19:08.733
My patience is growing thin.

19:08.871 --> 19:10.321
Okay, all right, man.

19:10.459 --> 19:11.874
Uh, we'll send out the spies.

19:12.012 --> 19:13.738
Just-just give us some time.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.671
Five minutes, no more.

19:17.535 --> 19:18.812
They must be watching
all the roads.

19:18.950 --> 19:19.986
Harry, the kids.

19:20.124 --> 19:20.883
Luther's trained
in evasive tactics.

19:21.021 --> 19:22.851
He'll keep them safe.

19:29.064 --> 19:30.065
Oh, you guys
need to check this out.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.860
Come here, come here.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.833
This is from Brazil last year.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.974
Guy executed six people to find
a single undercover agent.

19:44.907 --> 19:46.426
That's not gonna happen here.

19:46.564 --> 19:48.601
How long do you think we have
to hold them off?

19:48.739 --> 19:51.776
I'd say five, ten minutes
once the shooting starts.

19:51.914 --> 19:53.088
I'll head to the balcony.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.607
Best place to defend
if they come at the front.

19:54.745 --> 19:55.953
Hey. [whistles]

19:56.091 --> 19:57.886
HARRY:
Just keep them back.
I got an idea.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.336
Hey, Harry, you're not
thinking of

19:59.474 --> 20:00.509
taking 'em on directly, are you?

20:00.647 --> 20:01.683
No.
Those guys are locals.

20:01.821 --> 20:03.029
Probably mercenaries
and criminals

20:03.167 --> 20:05.204
that he picked up along the way.

20:05.342 --> 20:08.034
We might be able
to scare 'em off, though.

20:08.172 --> 20:10.036
Do you have any explosives here?

20:10.174 --> 20:11.555
A few planted in the hotel
in case we need to

20:11.693 --> 20:12.832
pull out and destroy
the facility.

20:12.970 --> 20:14.903
Hey, Harry...

20:15.041 --> 20:16.732
are you thinking Sound and Fury?

20:16.870 --> 20:18.734
Unless you got a better idea.

20:21.427 --> 20:22.738
Sound and Fury it is.

20:22.876 --> 20:24.706
What's Sound and Fury?

20:24.844 --> 20:26.259
I'll explain to you on the way.
Come on.

20:26.397 --> 20:29.124
Hey, make sure everyone's
ready to fight. And warn Maria.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.746
Yeah.

20:32.507 --> 20:33.922
What kind of sales training
is this?

20:34.060 --> 20:36.027
It's just... it's just walking.

20:36.165 --> 20:37.581
Just walking.

20:37.719 --> 20:38.823
-Okay, Brad...
-Well, you know what I mean.

20:38.961 --> 20:40.549
-[phone vibrates]
-Sales is about focusing

20:40.687 --> 20:41.999
-on a goal. Hello?
-I...

20:42.137 --> 20:43.552
-GIB: Hey, Maria.
-Hi.

20:43.690 --> 20:45.727
So, uh, things are looking bad.

20:45.865 --> 20:47.901
Awesome.
We're doing great here.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.214
Bonding like you
would not believe.

20:50.352 --> 20:52.596
-It's Jann Isaacs.
-Oh.

20:52.734 --> 20:54.667
He found us through
the Mexican spy delegation.

20:54.805 --> 20:56.082
He's looking to take hostages,

20:56.220 --> 20:58.498
and chances are you've got
men on your tail.

20:58.636 --> 20:59.844
Thanks for letting me know.

20:59.982 --> 21:01.087
All right, look, Maria,
we're not gonna be able

21:01.225 --> 21:03.054
to get out there to help you
anytime soon.

21:03.192 --> 21:04.159
Can you handle this on
your own?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.334
Well, I am

21:06.472 --> 21:08.577
excited for the challenge.

21:08.715 --> 21:11.580
Okay, I got to go.
Good luck, Maria.

21:11.718 --> 21:13.444
Thanks.

21:13.582 --> 21:15.101
That was corporate.

21:15.239 --> 21:17.276
They're really excited
everyone's participating

21:17.414 --> 21:18.346
-in the sales hike.
-[groans]: Oh, man.

21:18.484 --> 21:20.175
They... [whoo]

21:20.313 --> 21:22.902
Just gonna take a selfie

21:23.040 --> 21:24.524
for the newsletter.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.054
Let's go.

21:37.192 --> 21:39.401
-Maria, I have to pee.
-Huh?

21:39.539 --> 21:43.025
Uh, and what would you do
if you had to pee

21:43.163 --> 21:44.130
during a sales call?

21:44.268 --> 21:45.994
Go?

21:46.995 --> 21:49.549
Or you hold it,

21:49.687 --> 21:52.241
because nothing
is more important than a sale.

21:52.380 --> 21:55.072
Right? I-It's the...
it's the journey there.

21:55.210 --> 21:58.731
So we're just gonna keep moving
and think dry thoughts.

21:58.869 --> 22:00.629
Sound and Fury
is a psyops tactic.

22:00.767 --> 22:03.425
We use it when we're
outnumbered. Basically, the idea

22:03.563 --> 22:05.910
is to trick the opposing force
into retreating.

22:06.048 --> 22:07.291
HELEN:
So that's what
the explosives are for?

22:07.429 --> 22:08.672
HARRY:
Exactly.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.674
The C-4 looks like Play-Doh
and has an electric

22:10.812 --> 22:11.744
-thingy in it?
-Yeah, that's it.

22:11.882 --> 22:13.815
-That's it.
-Oh, okay.

22:13.953 --> 22:15.195
The goal here is just
to stay out of sight,

22:15.334 --> 22:17.094
make 'em think that
there's a bunch of us

22:17.232 --> 22:19.338
and then hopefully scare them
into retreating.

22:22.237 --> 22:23.238
Okay, so everybody
goes out there and...

22:23.376 --> 22:25.171
Not everybody.
Just me.

22:25.309 --> 22:26.862
Excuse me?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.968
Harry, you're going alone?

22:30.383 --> 22:32.385
Ugh. This sucks.

22:32.523 --> 22:34.767
We could have gone Jet Skiing
on the water,

22:34.905 --> 22:36.424
but you wanted to go
and try and buy beer.

22:36.562 --> 22:38.771
Three bars and zero beers.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.083
Okay, who knew Mexican
bartenders could tell

22:41.221 --> 22:42.533
a fake ID from Maryland?

22:42.671 --> 22:44.777
If you paid a little
more attention in Spanish class,

22:44.915 --> 22:46.330
you could have convinced them.

22:46.468 --> 22:47.435
I mean, what did you say
to that one guy?

22:47.573 --> 22:50.955
"I drink allowed.
Very old."

22:51.093 --> 22:52.888
Okay, well, it doesn't
make me look any older

22:53.026 --> 22:53.889
when you stand there
looking like

22:54.027 --> 22:55.201
you're about to pee your pants.

22:55.339 --> 22:56.513
-I wasn't gonna...
-LUTHER: Hey, guys.

22:56.651 --> 22:58.446
Ha!

22:58.584 --> 23:01.552
Dana and Jake Tasker.
The Taskeritos.

23:01.690 --> 23:04.037
That doesn't sound good
when I say it.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.971
This... What are...
This is fun,

23:07.109 --> 23:09.388
that I just bumped into you guys

23:09.526 --> 23:11.251
like this by accident.
I, uh...

23:11.390 --> 23:12.632
What are you guy...
what are you doing?

23:12.770 --> 23:14.738
Uh, hey. Uh, nothing.
We weren't, uh...

23:14.876 --> 23:16.567
What are you doing here?

23:16.705 --> 23:18.742
Aren't you supposed to
be doing, like, sales stuff?

23:18.880 --> 23:21.814
[scoffs]
I mean, whatever. Sales.

23:21.952 --> 23:23.919
I'm just, like, so over it.
You know?

23:24.057 --> 23:25.576
I just want to, like, get out,

23:25.714 --> 23:27.854
see the sights, have some fun.

23:29.511 --> 23:30.478
Here's an idea.

23:32.169 --> 23:33.481
Taco crawl.

23:34.516 --> 23:36.345
Taco crawl?

23:37.554 --> 23:40.349
Yeah, we were actually

23:40.488 --> 23:42.317
-about to just
walk back or whatever.
-JAKE: Yeah. Yeah.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.423
Come on, guys, tacos.

23:44.561 --> 23:47.080
-Who doesn't love tacos?
-I am kind of hungry, so...

23:47.218 --> 23:48.737
Okay, well,
you're always hungry.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.946
Settled.
We're going to get tacos.

23:51.084 --> 23:52.431
All right?
I know this great place.

23:52.569 --> 23:55.606
It's... Where it is
is down... There... It's...

23:55.744 --> 23:58.264
Um, I know it
when we get in the car.

23:58.402 --> 23:59.921
Been there a lot.

24:00.059 --> 24:03.027
We need to find some way
out of the building for Harry.

24:03.165 --> 24:05.202
Someplace where
he won't be seen.

24:05.340 --> 24:07.204
Well, there are some windows
on the east side.

24:07.342 --> 24:09.862
GIB:
I need something with cover.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.657
The utility room.

24:11.795 --> 24:13.728
There's an access grate.
It goes through those bushes.

24:15.005 --> 24:16.213
GIB:
Yes!

24:16.351 --> 24:19.768
Yes, this is perfect.
I could ki-kiss you...

24:19.906 --> 24:21.529
Oh, Tomas!

24:21.667 --> 24:23.220
Hey, how we looking out there?

24:23.358 --> 24:25.705
Guys, we have a problem.
I think they're done waiting.

24:25.843 --> 24:27.811
[shouting in Spanish]

24:29.571 --> 24:31.987
Move! Move!

24:32.850 --> 24:33.920
[gasps]

24:41.790 --> 24:43.343
HELEN:
Harry, I don't understand.
How can it

24:43.482 --> 24:44.897
possibly work for you
to go out there alone?

24:45.035 --> 24:46.312
Well, the same way
it worked in Lebanon,

24:46.450 --> 24:47.658
Somalia and Haiti.

24:47.796 --> 24:50.247
So, I've got about a dozen
explosive charges.

24:50.385 --> 24:51.386
How we coming
on those detonators?

24:51.524 --> 24:53.077
I did the best I could.
They're all

24:53.215 --> 24:54.354
-on different channels.
-It'll have to do.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.702
And what kind of tactical gear
do we have?

24:56.840 --> 24:58.462
There's a small armory,
but there's just the basics.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.844
-[gunfire continuing]
-Ah.

25:03.536 --> 25:04.675
They're coming in, guys.

25:04.813 --> 25:06.401
All right, Harry.
Let's rock and roll, baby.

25:06.539 --> 25:09.369
-It's go time.
-Let's go.

25:16.376 --> 25:17.585
GIB:
Tomas,

25:17.723 --> 25:20.001
two coming in
on the west side, on your right.

25:20.139 --> 25:22.244
East side, I got two more
trying to get in

25:22.382 --> 25:24.315
along the wall.

25:24.453 --> 25:26.628
No, H-Helen, I don't need that.

25:26.766 --> 25:28.457
Thank you so much, but I have
a way of doing things.

25:28.596 --> 25:30.390
Harry, I'm just trying to make
sure that you have everything

25:30.529 --> 25:32.772
that you need. Remember
during our honeymoon,

25:32.910 --> 25:34.394
-you forgot your toothbrush.?
-Yeah... Toothbrush?

25:34.533 --> 25:36.604
-Uh-huh.
-Gib, what's my approach?

25:36.742 --> 25:38.778
Utility room grate.
East side. Go.

25:38.916 --> 25:41.160
Okay. No, I don't need that.
Thank you so much.

25:55.899 --> 25:57.452
So, they were married before
she worked for Omega?

25:57.590 --> 25:58.902
[chuckles]
Yeah.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.904
Yeah, then he blew his cover
and they brought her in.

26:01.042 --> 26:03.907
Tomas, two more,
coming up on your left.

26:06.116 --> 26:08.428
That's sweet
that they work together.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.154
You think it's sweet?
I'm worried that they're

26:10.292 --> 26:12.260
-gonna kill each other.
-Well, it's not
always comfortable

26:12.398 --> 26:13.917
bringing in someone new.
Sofia,

26:14.055 --> 26:15.263
11 o'clock!

26:15.401 --> 26:18.991
But it can be good.
New energy, new ideas.

26:19.129 --> 26:21.510
Speaking of,
I think we can hack

26:21.649 --> 26:23.374
the radio frequencies
of the guys outside.

26:23.512 --> 26:26.239
-You can? Seriously?
-Yeah.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.482
We can slip in some
disinformation

26:27.620 --> 26:28.759
when Harry's ready.

26:28.897 --> 26:30.002
Make them believe
they're outnumbered.

26:30.140 --> 26:31.348
Get them to retreat.

26:31.486 --> 26:33.143
That's a... that's
an amazing idea.

26:33.281 --> 26:34.213
[chuckles softly]

26:34.351 --> 26:36.284
-[loud explosion]
-BOTH: Aah!

26:37.285 --> 26:38.769
Uh, Ramon, Sofia,

26:38.907 --> 26:39.943
I need you guys to concentrate

26:40.081 --> 26:41.254
your fire on the two units

26:41.392 --> 26:43.602
moving along
the wall on the west side.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.120
[explosion in distance]

26:45.258 --> 26:47.398
Wha-What...
What are all those noises?

26:47.536 --> 26:49.677
-Those?
-Yeah.

26:49.815 --> 26:51.195
They're the fireworks.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.612
And why are there fireworks?

26:53.750 --> 26:56.442
Um, the festival.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.099
In town.

26:58.237 --> 27:00.549
Uh, Festival del Arte.

27:00.688 --> 27:02.379
It's-it's a big thing.
It's a big deal.

27:02.517 --> 27:05.554
Well, are-are we
gonna stop soon? I mean,

27:05.693 --> 27:08.040
look, the people--
they're-they're tired.

27:08.178 --> 27:10.180
-Uh-huh.
-And we didn't bring any water.

27:10.318 --> 27:11.699
And I still have to pee.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.873
Okay, well,
Rose can't have any water,

27:14.011 --> 27:14.874
-right? And...
-Uh, but...

27:15.012 --> 27:17.152
We'll stop soon.
Pretty soon.

27:17.290 --> 27:18.706
-I think it's just up there.
-But...

27:18.844 --> 27:21.225
Just, we've just got
to keep going, okay?

27:21.363 --> 27:22.882
-Okay.
-You're doing great.

27:23.020 --> 27:24.712
Keep going, keep going.

27:24.850 --> 27:27.611
Doing great. Keep going.

27:39.312 --> 27:41.280
Not gonna get away like this.

27:47.148 --> 27:49.909
Wait! Harry.

27:50.047 --> 27:51.635
-I'm going with you.
-What are...

27:51.773 --> 27:53.085
what are you talking about?

27:53.223 --> 27:54.327
I'm going out there with you.
I'm not gonna let you

27:54.465 --> 27:55.984
-go out there alone.
-No. Absolutely not.

27:56.122 --> 27:57.365
It's too dangerous.

27:57.503 --> 27:59.505
Too dangerous?
Harry, if this doesn't work out,

27:59.643 --> 28:00.817
those guys out there
are gonna come in here

28:00.955 --> 28:02.266
and I'm gonna be
in danger anyways.

28:02.404 --> 28:04.406
Okay, look, look, the whole
point of Sound and Fury

28:04.544 --> 28:05.649
is to be invisible, stealthy.

28:05.787 --> 28:07.030
Two people can be stealthy.

28:07.168 --> 28:08.997
Remember when we used to
sneak into the kids' room

28:09.135 --> 28:10.412
and put money underneath
their pillows?

28:10.550 --> 28:11.586
That was one of us, right?

28:11.724 --> 28:13.105
People weren't shooting at us

28:13.243 --> 28:14.451
when we were playing
the tooth fairy, Harry!

28:14.589 --> 28:17.765
All I'm saying is I've
done this before, Helen.

28:17.903 --> 28:19.456
There's a way I do things.

28:19.594 --> 28:21.423
Well, it's not always
the best way.

28:21.561 --> 28:22.770
Helen, you cannot come in here

28:22.908 --> 28:24.219
and change everything.

28:24.357 --> 28:25.945
I'm not trying
to change everything.

28:26.083 --> 28:27.188
But you can't cut me out.

28:27.326 --> 28:28.776
I'm part of this team, too.

28:28.914 --> 28:30.605
You have your chest plate,
a gun,

28:30.743 --> 28:32.193
multiple packs of C-4,

28:32.331 --> 28:33.781
and I don't even know
how many detonators

28:33.919 --> 28:35.058
in the same bag.

28:35.196 --> 28:37.060
You think you're gonna
keep that all organized?

28:37.198 --> 28:38.958
You don't think I could be
a little bit helpful?

28:39.096 --> 28:42.721
Okay, okay, it could
possibly be helpful

28:42.859 --> 28:45.240
if somebody handled detonators.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.073
Then I'll handle the detonators.

28:56.217 --> 28:58.253
[gunfire continuing in distance]

29:02.637 --> 29:05.985
So, what's up with you
skipping out

29:06.123 --> 29:08.747
on all the sales stuff
this afternoon to go to the bar?

29:08.885 --> 29:11.404
Dad always talks about how
you're, like, Mr. Sales.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.579
Does he?

29:13.717 --> 29:15.926
I guess I do have
a bit of a reputation.

29:16.064 --> 29:17.514
No doubt.

29:17.652 --> 29:18.998
I mean, Dad has this really
funny impression of you.

29:19.136 --> 29:22.174
-Remember?
-Yeah.

29:22.312 --> 29:23.520
I know. "Hey, baby,

29:23.658 --> 29:25.764
"computers are what
brings the world together.

29:25.902 --> 29:27.938
-Hey." Yeah.
-It's not quite like that.

29:28.076 --> 29:29.837
It's not as funny
when you do it.

29:29.975 --> 29:31.528
Eh...

29:31.666 --> 29:34.358
So, uh, where, exactly,
is this taco place?

29:34.496 --> 29:36.844
Um, I don't know
exactly where it is,

29:36.982 --> 29:37.983
but it's here somewhere.

29:38.121 --> 29:39.778
DANA:
Okay, well, it's kind of weird

29:39.916 --> 29:41.434
that someone would
sell tacos out here

29:41.572 --> 29:43.747
-rather than by the lake.
-It's not weird.
It's not weird.

29:43.885 --> 29:45.611
It's Mexico. They just...

29:45.749 --> 29:46.923
They do things a little
differently down here.

29:47.061 --> 29:49.373
Um, guys, I think
that Jeep's following us.

29:51.272 --> 29:52.687
DANA:
I think they want you
to pull over.

29:52.825 --> 29:53.964
JAKE:
Is that a gun?

29:54.102 --> 29:57.140
Guns?
Why do they have guns?

29:57.278 --> 29:58.348
Probably the police.
Obviously you were trying

29:58.486 --> 29:59.383
to buy beer earlier.

29:59.521 --> 30:00.557
You think the beer police is

30:00.695 --> 30:02.490
-chasing us with guns?
-Yes.

30:02.628 --> 30:05.148
Hey, guys, you ever try to, um,

30:05.286 --> 30:07.253
outrun the cops?

30:07.391 --> 30:08.461
What?

30:08.599 --> 30:10.291
Let's get crazy.
Let's do it.

30:10.429 --> 30:11.430
[gasps]

30:13.190 --> 30:14.571
What are you doing?

30:14.709 --> 30:16.331
What do you think,
I'm just a-a sales guy

30:16.469 --> 30:18.161
that's never run
from the cops before?

30:20.025 --> 30:22.165
-You've done this before?
-Sure.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.242
[gunfire in distance]

30:30.380 --> 30:33.245
GIB: Okay, Team Tasker,
you're gonna plant
those charges

30:33.383 --> 30:35.109
in the trees behind the gunmen.

30:35.247 --> 30:38.491
Then, on my go, you're gonna
light up those boxes of ammo

30:38.629 --> 30:39.768
and lure them back toward you.

31:00.065 --> 31:01.583
Tomas, they're trying the lobby,

31:01.721 --> 31:02.861
straight ahead.

31:09.764 --> 31:12.629
Harry, you are 78 yards
west of the tree line.

31:12.767 --> 31:14.734
-Helen.
-Helen, you're slipping.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.460
Speed up, speed up.
Okay, stay low, guys.

31:16.598 --> 31:17.806
They're-they're
right in front of you.

31:17.945 --> 31:19.705
Ramon, you got two creeping up
on you right now.

31:19.843 --> 31:21.500
Your east side.
That is your right side.

31:30.164 --> 31:31.234
[groans]

31:31.372 --> 31:32.373
Tomas, what happened?

31:32.511 --> 31:34.237
I'm hit, but I'm okay.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.412
Guys, keep firing.
Keep firing.

31:37.550 --> 31:40.070
We got this.
I'll go get Tomas.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.727

31:41.865 --> 31:44.557
Hey, Harry, we're down
a man over here. You ready?

31:44.695 --> 31:46.180
I guess we'll have to be.

[laughs]

32:02.161 --> 32:04.923
Enough? Oh, baby,
we're just getting started.

32:05.061 --> 32:06.752
What kind of game
do you think you're playing?

32:06.890 --> 32:09.030
Omega Sector doesn't play games.

32:09.168 --> 32:10.583
Why do you think you've
never captured one of us?

32:10.721 --> 32:13.241
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

32:13.379 --> 32:15.519
You don't think I know a bluff
when I hear one?

32:15.657 --> 32:17.866
We shot your man on the balcony.
We're coming in.

32:18.005 --> 32:20.248
Oh, don't bother.
We'll come to you.

32:20.386 --> 32:21.905
Harry,

32:22.043 --> 32:24.356
you're up.
Make some noise.

In the trees.

We were worried about you.

You want to be taken
alive or dead?

I'd rather take you alive,
since your corpse

So, uh, I just... I-I just
wanted to-to let you know

39:25.190 --> 39:27.295
how incredible you were today.

39:27.434 --> 39:31.196
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm just doing my job.

39:31.334 --> 39:33.612
Yeah, but it's a job
that I do solo,

39:33.750 --> 39:36.719
and today I was a little bit
better because of you.

39:36.857 --> 39:38.030
-Really?
-Really.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.031
-Wow.
-Yeah.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.034
Um... you're welcome.

39:42.172 --> 39:44.071
[both chuckle]

39:44.209 --> 39:47.626
So, um, about that dance, you...

39:47.764 --> 39:50.215
Oh, uh...

39:50.353 --> 39:52.666
I thought you would never ask.

39:52.804 --> 39:55.496
Oh.

39:57.256 --> 39:58.568
Hi.

39:58.706 --> 40:00.639
Mom, why do you keep
hugging us?

40:01.709 --> 40:03.918
Because I missed you

40:04.056 --> 40:05.920
when you were at the ATV thingy.

40:06.058 --> 40:09.993
And you know, moms
loving their kids and stuff.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.719
There's Maria.
I'm gonna go dance with her.

40:11.857 --> 40:13.583
Okay.

40:13.721 --> 40:14.998
Love you.

40:15.136 --> 40:18.208
["No Me Aguanto" by Mike Jiminez

40:18.346 --> 40:20.348
Love you.

40:27.977 --> 40:29.565
Want to dance?

40:29.703 --> 40:31.325
[laughs]
Yes.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.154
Oh, but first,

40:33.292 --> 40:34.949
I have a confession.

40:36.710 --> 40:39.782
I might have...

40:39.920 --> 40:41.162
given your lucky knife

40:41.300 --> 40:42.405
to the Goodwill.

40:42.543 --> 40:44.269
Helen.

40:44.407 --> 40:46.236
There were two boxes.

40:46.374 --> 40:47.514
One was for old tools

40:47.652 --> 40:48.860
and then the other one
was for donations

40:48.998 --> 40:51.241
and I think I put your
lucky knife in that box.

40:51.379 --> 40:52.622
[sighs]

40:52.760 --> 40:54.624
That's okay.
It's okay.

40:54.762 --> 40:57.282
-I'll just get another wife...
Knife. Knife.
-Oh.

40:57.420 --> 40:58.939
[laughs]:
Okay.

40:59.077 --> 41:01.079
You saved everyone today.

41:01.217 --> 41:03.495
We saved everyone.

41:04.531 --> 41:06.533
So you really didn't like
sharing a toothbrush

41:06.671 --> 41:09.259
-on our honeymoon?
-No.

41:09.397 --> 41:10.709
That's disgusting.
Harry.

41:10.847 --> 41:12.746
Oh, okay.
So, then you'll agree that

41:12.884 --> 41:15.645
maybe sometimes you shouldn't
mess with other people's stuff.

41:15.783 --> 41:17.820
