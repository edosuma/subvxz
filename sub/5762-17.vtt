00:03.770 --> 00:05.360
I just had the worst dream.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.980
-It was just a dream.
-No.

00:06.980 --> 00:08.310
This was a memory.

00:08.310 --> 00:09.410
The only way it's gonna stop

00:09.410 --> 00:12.030
Is if i can figure out who this masked guy is.

00:12.030 --> 00:13.950
I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my father.

00:13.950 --> 00:16.400
What is it that i need to know, dad?

00:16.400 --> 00:18.570
The truth about grandview, why you're here,

00:18.570 --> 00:20.240
The dangers you're facing.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.360
There's no record of his death?

00:23.360 --> 00:24.500
Not that i could find.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.340
No burial, no cremation.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.380
What are these numbers?

00:30.380 --> 00:31.730
I don't know. Must have pulled an old file folder.

00:31.730 --> 00:32.680
It's not my handwriting.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.820
Carl, i just saw you write them down.

00:36.830 --> 00:37.730
I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.050
I respect the short order cook.

00:39.050 --> 00:40.280
They, after all, have built

00:40.280 --> 00:43.030
And maintained the temple that you see before you,

00:43.030 --> 00:45.220
But was that the best use of your father's law degree?

00:45.220 --> 00:47.570
I think he just took that job because he was on the run.

00:47.570 --> 00:49.040
Ooh, ok, now you have my attention.

00:49.040 --> 00:49.960
On the run from what?

00:49.960 --> 00:52.850
I don't know. But what's interesting isn't inside the file,

00:52.850 --> 00:54.100
it's what's on the front.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.730
At first i thought it was a phone number,

00:55.730 --> 00:56.700
But there's too many digits.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.650
And you're married,

00:57.650 --> 00:59.850
And any detective worth his weight in salt

00:59.850 --> 01:02.580
Can see that you have an enormous rock on your finger.

01:02.580 --> 01:03.860
You're not getting the point.

01:03.860 --> 01:05.450
The guy did not write this.

01:05.450 --> 01:07.440
A spirit using his body did.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.550
-You saw another possession?
-I think so.

01:09.550 --> 01:10.760
I searched the numbers on the web.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.590
I tracked 'em down as a social security number...

01:14.010 --> 01:16.160
What?What is that look?

01:20.760 --> 01:23.930
1979, is that a year or did you just graffiti my numbers?

01:23.930 --> 01:25.300
1979 is the year.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.890
It's a court case. It's a docket number.

01:26.890 --> 01:28.470
5 digits, followed by the year.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.430
Anybody knows that that has ever been sued

01:30.430 --> 01:32.720
Or sued or fought speeding tickets or several.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.630
-Haven't you ever done that?
-No.

01:34.630 --> 01:35.650
I fight all of mine,

01:35.650 --> 01:36.290
Even if i'm guilty.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.780
I feel like judges, at a certain time of day,

01:37.780 --> 01:39.130
They get tired, so they take pity-

01:39.130 --> 01:41.240
Ok, if it's a case, would it be online?

01:41.240 --> 01:43.190
I'm not sure, but you can check with the courts,

01:43.190 --> 01:44.820
'Cause once an arrest has been made,

01:44.820 --> 01:46.120
It's always public record.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.100
Thank you.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.070
What's the rush?

01:49.070 --> 01:51.560
Do you have any idea how long i have talked about

01:51.560 --> 01:53.080
Finding out what happened to my father?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.710
I mean, how he died,

01:54.710 --> 01:56.040
What happened to him before that?

01:56.040 --> 01:59.370
It's like... Somebody wants me to find out the truth.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.150
They were just waiting on me to ask.

02:07.090 --> 02:09.250
-Hey.
-Hey, stranger.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.720
Yeah, i know.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.910
Long night shift.

02:12.290 --> 02:13.480
Listen, i was on my way to see you,

02:13.480 --> 02:14.780
But then i started reading this,

02:14.780 --> 02:16.170
And i just couldn't put it down.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.790
Wait, so that number was a case file.

02:17.790 --> 02:19.170
Yeah, payne was right.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.960
It's a case that my father prosecuted when he was an a.d.a.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.140
It's so interesting, 'cause...

02:24.140 --> 02:26.240
You know, i was 9 when my dad left.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.500
And... My memories of him,

02:28.500 --> 02:30.480
Sometimes i feel like i made him up.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.750
But, reading this?

02:31.820 --> 02:35.100
What he had to say in court, it's like hearing his voice.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.220
<i>the state vs. Paul eastman?</i>

02:38.220 --> 02:40.200
Yeah, this little boy, michael wilkins,

02:40.200 --> 02:41.690
Was strangled in the woods.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.110
Paul eastman led them to his body.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.190
He was convicted of the crime,

02:44.190 --> 02:45.880
But that's all i really know.

02:46.310 --> 02:48.740
About the little boy, this case...

02:49.130 --> 02:50.610
Why i was led to it.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.150
It's just not enough.

02:55.810 --> 02:56.820
Hello.

02:56.820 --> 02:57.780
Can i help you?

02:57.780 --> 02:58.880
Hi, i hope so.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.860
Um, my name is melinda gordon.

03:00.860 --> 03:02.600
Are you ellen wilkins?

03:02.600 --> 03:03.340
Yes.

03:03.340 --> 03:04.720
Mom? Who is it?

03:04.720 --> 03:07.470
Oh, um, melinda, right?

03:07.470 --> 03:08.790
This is my son graham.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.710
Hi.I was looking for some information,

03:10.710 --> 03:13.180
And i think you might be able to help me.

03:13.180 --> 03:14.110
Ok...

03:14.110 --> 03:15.670
My father...

03:16.500 --> 03:19.110
Was the prosecutor for your son's case.

03:19.110 --> 03:20.870
His name is tom gordon.

03:22.230 --> 03:23.150
No.

03:23.150 --> 03:24.610
That was too long ago.

03:24.610 --> 03:27.020
Please. I know it's been years.

03:27.020 --> 03:29.110
My father's been missing almost as long,

03:29.110 --> 03:30.660
And i think that his disappearance

03:30.660 --> 03:33.840
Is tied to your son's death in some way.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.460
I really don't want to talk about it.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.590
And i'm so sorry to ask you to.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.700
We don't want you here.

03:46.090 --> 03:48.110
Uh, could i come in for a moment?

03:48.110 --> 03:50.570
You said your father's missing?

03:50.570 --> 03:52.860
The truth is, i think he's dead.

03:54.820 --> 03:55.820
Mom.

03:56.530 --> 03:58.010
Let's just see if we can help her.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.470
Well, i was researching the case,

04:02.470 --> 04:05.160
And the truth is, i don't have much to go on.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.230
Did you get to know my father at all during the trial?

04:08.230 --> 04:10.160
Don't talk about this! Make her leave!

04:10.160 --> 04:12.020
Why are you even listening to her?!

04:14.400 --> 04:15.330
Did...

04:15.330 --> 04:16.880
Did you see that?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.110
Oh, must have been the cat.

04:19.110 --> 04:22.220
Mom, you said you were keeping the cat out on the sun porch.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.520
Our daughter's allergic.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.620
My wife and i are here with the kids for a few weeks visiting

04:26.620 --> 04:27.920
while we work on the house.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.560
You should check on the cat.

04:29.620 --> 04:30.370
If she got out,

04:30.370 --> 04:33.100
She's probably in the pantry.

04:35.390 --> 04:37.950
-If there's a better time
-there's not.

04:37.950 --> 04:42.140
I don't know if you can understand this,

04:42.140 --> 04:44.340
But my youngest michael,

04:44.340 --> 04:46.250
This is still his home.

04:46.250 --> 04:50.200
And i can't, i won't, talk about his death.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.030
Not to you, not to anyone.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.810
Because i'm not dead!

04:55.600 --> 04:57.690
-Don't say that! Never say that!
-It's ok.

05:00.380 --> 05:01.740
Don't worry, honey.

05:02.380 --> 05:03.580
She's leaving.

05:05.610 --> 05:07.030
You should leave now.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.300
Stop, you're hurting me!

05:09.300 --> 05:10.210
How am i hurting you?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.470
Excuse me. Grandma!

05:11.820 --> 05:14.350
It's my turn! No, it isn't!

05:14.350 --> 05:17.090
-Tell her it's my turn!
-????

05:17.090 --> 05:19.540
Children, stop fighting!

05:19.540 --> 05:21.460
I told you we'd get in trouble.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.630
You kept his room.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.170
You made a place for him.

05:31.830 --> 05:34.220
Does everyone know he's here?

05:34.220 --> 05:36.560
Oh...Pierce, daisy,

05:36.560 --> 05:38.020
Go play in the guest room.

05:38.020 --> 05:40.390
Ok? It's all right. I'm not mad.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.480
Who are you, and what do you want, really?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.740
I can see spirits... Ghosts,

05:52.740 --> 05:56.010
And i can see your son, michael.

05:56.010 --> 05:58.370
You can see my son?

05:59.530 --> 06:00.810
Yes.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.840
Guessing that's not a shock to you.

06:06.610 --> 06:10.140
Michael loves his home and his family.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.460
He may live differently, but he lives.

06:13.460 --> 06:17.080
And that's not going to change, not ever.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.340
So how long

07:01.340 --> 07:03.320
Have you known that he's been here with you?

07:03.320 --> 07:06.210
Oh, since the day he didn't come home for dinner,

07:06.210 --> 07:08.240
Going on 30 years now.

07:08.580 --> 07:11.820
At first my husband thought i'd lost my mind in grief,

07:11.820 --> 07:14.530
And then he thought i just lost my mind.

07:14.530 --> 07:17.290
But it was so obvious to me.

07:17.290 --> 07:21.420
Our son couldn't be gone, he just couldn't.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.730
Who else knows about this?

07:23.730 --> 07:25.690
Well, when it first started,

07:25.690 --> 07:28.280
I told michael to let graham be.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.510
Graham was just 12, and we didn't want to frighten him.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.850
And things just sort of stayed that way.

07:33.850 --> 07:35.450
But your granddaughter...

07:35.900 --> 07:37.770
She seemed to be able to see him.

07:37.770 --> 07:42.450
Yeah, i find children do when they're still very young.

07:42.890 --> 07:44.750
I told you it was our secret.

07:47.290 --> 07:49.040
Do you mind if i talk to michael?

07:49.040 --> 07:52.380
As long as your questions don't upset him.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.130
Michael?

07:54.130 --> 07:57.020
I'm here because a spirit sent me a message.

07:57.020 --> 08:00.860
About your case, and what happened to you.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.680
Was that message from you?

08:03.680 --> 08:06.320
I've been right here this whole time.I've been good.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.780
I'm sure you have.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.460
But you've been here for so long,

08:10.810 --> 08:13.500
It makes me think that maybe something's holding you here,

08:13.870 --> 08:15.740
Something you want your mom to know?

08:20.740 --> 08:22.940
You know that this isn't right,

08:22.940 --> 08:25.090
Keeping him here with you.

08:25.090 --> 08:27.200
Spirits belong in the light.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.370
Michael's a child. He's 10 years old.

08:31.370 --> 08:35.370
He'll be 10 years old forever, and that's too young.

08:35.370 --> 08:38.030
It's too young to be on his own.

08:38.030 --> 08:39.080
Right.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.900
You can't keep him here until-

08:40.900 --> 08:43.900
Till the day i die, and then we'll go,

08:43.900 --> 08:47.960
Together. And you could help us then, ok?

08:52.940 --> 08:54.730
I have never seen anything like it.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.140
He was insisting he was alive,

08:56.140 --> 08:58.230
But she knew he was a ghost.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.070
You've dealt with families who thought they were haunted before.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.530
Well, they've sensed a presence, which is a lot different than,

09:03.530 --> 09:05.640
"oh, hey, could you schooch over for dead mikey?"

09:05.640 --> 09:07.470
Wait a minute, they thought that they could see him?

09:07.470 --> 09:10.070
Well, his mother couldn't. I saw her try to talk to him when he wasn't there.

09:10.070 --> 09:12.570
But his niece and nephew, especially the little one,

09:12.570 --> 09:15.120
She definitely knew he was there.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.040
And i want to help them,

09:16.040 --> 09:18.240
But i didn't go there expecting to meet that boy.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.360
What were you looking for?

09:19.360 --> 09:22.020
I mean, the case has been closed for almost 30 years.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.280
I don't know. I just trust that if a ghost comes to me in any way,

09:26.280 --> 09:28.510
It's because they want me to help them somehow.

09:28.510 --> 09:30.130
You know, or they want me to send a message

09:30.130 --> 09:33.160
Or find out the truth about how they died.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.380
Or what happened after they died.

09:38.260 --> 09:40.140
Paul eastman, the man who killed michael,

09:40.140 --> 09:42.010
Was convicted by my father.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.740
But there was a fire at the prison,

09:43.740 --> 09:45.650
And he used it to escape.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.280
Did they ever find him?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.660
No.He disappeared.

09:51.630 --> 09:52.780
They never found a body,

09:52.780 --> 09:55.020
And he's still wanted by the police.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.000
Sweet girl.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.080
Dad...

11:02.730 --> 11:03.750
I'm here.

11:09.430 --> 11:10.920
Where am i?

11:11.510 --> 11:12.900
It's ok, honey.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.010
There was a man...

11:15.650 --> 11:19.150
Wearing a mask, and it- i was really scared.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.740
Shh.It was only a dream.

11:22.490 --> 11:24.440
Why do i keep having it?

11:25.660 --> 11:27.060
Did i know him?

11:27.060 --> 11:29.360
You're in danger, melinda.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.030
How?

11:32.460 --> 11:34.400
Please, i want to help you.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.960
I don't know that you can, honey.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.620
Be careful.

11:38.620 --> 11:40.300
Don't trust anyone.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.350
What are you talking about?

11:42.350 --> 11:44.520
Don't assume anyone is who they seem...

11:44.980 --> 11:46.350
Not even me.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.310
No!

11:53.150 --> 11:54.590
You get done with a 12-hour shift,

11:54.590 --> 11:57.370
And i welcome you home with this. I'm so sorry i keep doing this to you.

11:57.370 --> 11:58.370
You're not doing it.

11:58.370 --> 11:59.650
It's your father.

12:00.340 --> 12:01.820
He just keeps telling me this was a dream,

12:01.820 --> 12:03.560
But it feels so real.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.820
What happened this time?

12:06.310 --> 12:08.030
I was walking, there was blood.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.820
The man was there, then he was gone.

12:09.820 --> 12:11.220
Thought i'd gotten away from him,

12:11.220 --> 12:13.210
But it all ties together somehow.

12:13.210 --> 12:16.750
The dream, the dead little boy, my father.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.930
Wait a minute.

12:20.620 --> 12:23.480
You said the mask was clear, right?

12:23.480 --> 12:25.120
With kind of a reddish tint.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.240
It was hard to tell.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.020
Or the face underneath it was red.

12:28.020 --> 12:30.890
Did you tell me that the man that killed the little boy,

12:30.890 --> 12:32.780
He escaped during a prison fire?

12:32.780 --> 12:34.240
Uh-huh.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.300
Sometimes facial burn victims

12:38.300 --> 12:40.270
Wear a clear mask during treatment

12:40.270 --> 12:42.980
So you can see the wound, but it's still protected.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.520
So you're saying the man in the mask

12:44.520 --> 12:46.210
Has been paul eastman this whole time?

12:46.210 --> 12:47.390
I don't know, is that possible?

12:47.390 --> 12:48.540
Well, the dream i keep having,

12:48.540 --> 12:50.130
It feels like a memory...

12:53.080 --> 12:54.980
Maybe the memory wasn't my own.

12:55.350 --> 12:56.420
Whose could it be?

12:56.420 --> 12:58.200
Someone else he killed.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.910
Maybe they gave me that vision.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.400
Wait a minute, the ghost of another victim-

13:02.400 --> 13:06.060
But as hard as he tried, my father couldn't stop paul eastman.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.330
The killer's still out there.

13:15.010 --> 13:16.210
Why are you being led to a case

13:16.210 --> 13:18.220
Your father tried 30 years ago?

13:18.220 --> 13:20.710
Because the killer's still out there.Maybe he's still killing.

13:20.710 --> 13:21.650
But why an old case?

13:21.650 --> 13:23.570
Why not something new, like a missing child report

13:23.570 --> 13:25.190
Or, i don't know, a fresh corpse?

13:25.190 --> 13:27.320
Look, all i know is this is the case that i was led to.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.490
It might have some information about my father's file,

13:29.490 --> 13:32.410
So stop asking me so many questions and help me. Ok.

13:32.410 --> 13:33.950
Why one of those has gobs of sugar?

13:33.950 --> 13:35.200
They both have gobs of sugar,

13:35.200 --> 13:36.380
'Cause they're both mine.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.660
What is it with you perky people?

13:37.660 --> 13:40.570
You think just because i answer my phone at dawn, i'm an early riser?I need these.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.160
Whatever.Just keep the archivist occupied, ok,

13:43.160 --> 13:44.350
So i can get the case file.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the archivist, that guy?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.580
Why do i have to talk to that guy?

13:47.580 --> 13:49.640
He's meaner than my uncle snarly.

13:50.770 --> 13:51.510
Hello.

13:51.510 --> 13:53.200
Ahem, excuse me.

13:54.110 --> 13:55.370
Good morning.

13:55.370 --> 13:57.370
Nice to see you again.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.150
What can i do for you?

13:59.150 --> 14:01.030
Well, actually, um,

14:01.030 --> 14:03.530
I'm looking for files on a court case.

14:03.530 --> 14:05.140
I have the docket number.

14:05.140 --> 14:06.730
Civil or criminal?

14:06.990 --> 14:08.050
Criminal.

14:08.550 --> 14:10.060
Third row on your right.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.400
Red tabs, they go by the year.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.990
Help yourself.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.610
When the town lets me shred,

14:18.010 --> 14:22.200
I shred. No better cure for the clutter.

14:24.570 --> 14:25.610
Coffee?

14:26.930 --> 14:28.180
Thanks!

14:33.470 --> 14:35.370
Hey. It's a good thing i was here,

14:35.370 --> 14:37.140
I totally won that guy over.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.720
Either that, or he got his meds right.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.690
91, 92. it's missing.

14:42.690 --> 14:44.970
Or he had a personality transplant.

14:47.530 --> 14:48.750
Oh, my god, you're right.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.420
Don't sound so surprised.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.990
He's possessed.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.200
Who are you?

14:57.200 --> 14:58.640
What are you trying to hide from me?

14:58.640 --> 15:01.120
You don't belong down here, missy.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.130
Neither do you.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.180
Let's go, melinda.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.800
No, i want to know who's possessing him.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.740
I want to see daylight again. Let's go now!

15:09.100 --> 15:10.220
Hey, you!

15:14.850 --> 15:16.070
Which one of those is for me?

15:16.070 --> 15:17.040
Neither.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.780
Then why did you buy 2 new coffees?

15:19.780 --> 15:20.990
I need them. These are decaf.

15:20.990 --> 15:23.730
After that incredibly creepy experience we had back there,

15:23.730 --> 15:25.200
I need to wind down a little.

15:25.670 --> 15:27.410
Is there anything in there about other abductions,

15:27.410 --> 15:29.740
I mean abductions other than the archivist's body?

15:29.740 --> 15:33.080
No.Nothing. No similar cases

15:33.080 --> 15:34.470
That match eastman's whereabouts.

15:34.470 --> 15:36.200
He's only a suspect in michael's death.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.160
That's great. I bought 4 overpriced coffees for nothing.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.750
Well, maybe not for nothing.

15:40.070 --> 15:42.860
Paul eastman made threats to my father outside the courtroom.

15:42.860 --> 15:45.720
My father told the judge about them; they were a part of the case.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.250
What kind of threats?Like death threats?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.830
I don't know why it never occurred to me.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.530
This guy threatened to kill my father;

15:50.530 --> 15:54.000
My father who didn't just walk out on my mom and me, he vanished,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.480
Only reappearing to me as a ghost.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.880
Whoa, that's pretty heavy.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.890
You don't think...

15:59.890 --> 16:02.020
We know that paul eastman escaped from jail,

16:02.020 --> 16:03.480
Never to be found.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.130
We know that he wanted my father dead.

16:07.610 --> 16:10.130
Maybe the murder my dad wants me to solve is his own.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.140
I'm so sorry...

16:38.140 --> 16:39.590
About before,Coming here

16:39.590 --> 16:41.260
And upsetting you and your son

16:41.260 --> 16:43.910
When i didn't know quite what i was looking for.

16:44.330 --> 16:47.360
Now you think that that man

16:47.720 --> 16:49.020
Who hurt michael is-

16:49.020 --> 16:51.260
I know that it's painful,

16:51.260 --> 16:53.590
But i hope that you can understand now.

16:53.590 --> 16:57.230
But what is it you think he can do to help you?

16:57.230 --> 16:58.870
Ghosts can travel.

16:58.870 --> 17:02.070
My hope is that michael might have seen something.

17:02.070 --> 17:03.450
This man is a predator,

17:03.450 --> 17:04.780
And michael knows what he looks like.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.420
I don't have to help you.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.319
You don't.

17:11.270 --> 17:14.000
But i noticed that you like to play superhero.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.089
And my father, he wasn't perfect,

17:16.089 --> 17:18.240
But he did like to help people.

17:18.550 --> 17:19.750
He caught the man who hurt you,

17:19.750 --> 17:21.430
And he put him in jail.

17:22.190 --> 17:23.970
Kind of like a hero.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.410
And if we could lead the police to him,

17:26.410 --> 17:28.660
Then you could be a hero, too.

17:28.660 --> 17:29.830
You don't know anything.

17:29.830 --> 17:30.880
Really?

17:30.880 --> 17:32.060
Well, then, why don't you tell me,

17:32.060 --> 17:33.660
Because you seem to know something.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.650
Please, what is he saying?

17:35.650 --> 17:38.990
I don't like you, and i don't like your questions.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.660
What's he saying?

17:41.660 --> 17:44.960
Tell her.Tell her i'm tired of this, and i want you to go away!

17:44.960 --> 17:46.540
He doesn't want to answer.

17:47.220 --> 17:50.030
That's not what i said! Tell her what i said!

17:50.030 --> 17:53.030
Michael, please.

17:53.510 --> 17:54.400
What's happening?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.480
Look, i know that this is hard,

17:55.480 --> 17:58.180
But i really do believe it's connected somehow.

18:01.570 --> 18:05.360
Pierce... Honey, what-what's wrong?

18:05.360 --> 18:08.110
She wouldn't tell you what i really said.

18:09.010 --> 18:11.200
I was trying to tell you to make her go.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.080
I've been trying to tell you!

18:13.080 --> 18:14.630
Honey, we've talked about this.

18:14.630 --> 18:17.380
I've told you, leave your nephew alone.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.720
Don't get mad at me, mommy!

18:21.680 --> 18:23.420
She made me do it.

18:31.060 --> 18:33.400
Don't let go of me, mommy.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.480
Never let go.

18:37.890 --> 18:39.920
Oh, sweetheart!

18:40.440 --> 18:42.560
I'm so sorry.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.240
What's happening to me?

18:44.650 --> 18:46.470
Pierce, is that you?

18:47.640 --> 18:48.980
I'm scared.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.910
What's happening to me?

18:50.910 --> 18:52.950
I don't know, but you're gonna be ok.

18:52.950 --> 18:54.490
Michael...

18:56.210 --> 18:57.680
It's time.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.840
Where am i?

19:04.840 --> 19:06.660
It's ok.

19:06.660 --> 19:13.430
???You're ok.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.540
Hey, we've seen a possession before, right?

19:18.540 --> 19:20.100
Where a spirit takes over a body

19:20.100 --> 19:21.850
And then releases it again later, right?

19:21.850 --> 19:22.820
Is this a survey?

19:22.820 --> 19:24.600
'Cause i'm pretty sure i'm on the do not call list.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.060
Listen, ok? I just saw something different.

19:27.060 --> 19:30.000
I saw a spirit existing apart from his body.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.810
Its living body.

19:31.810 --> 19:34.290
That kid michael just possessed his nephew.

19:34.290 --> 19:35.950
Well, that's spectral displacement.

19:35.950 --> 19:38.050
Yeah, ok, break that down for me and quick.

19:38.050 --> 19:41.000
It's an advanced iteration of the possession phenomenon.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.580
The visiting spirit, the possessor, if you will,

19:43.580 --> 19:46.190
Doesn't control the host body's consciousness.

19:46.190 --> 19:47.940
It gives it the old heave-ho,

19:47.940 --> 19:50.190
Creating what we call a displaced spirit.

19:50.530 --> 19:52.090
I can't believe you've actually seen one.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.740
Yeah, and i don't think it's my first.

20:00.180 --> 20:01.630
I need to talk to you.

20:02.370 --> 20:03.730
How did you find me?

20:06.240 --> 20:07.450
You've been keeping tabs?

20:07.450 --> 20:11.440
No, but it comes in handy to have an extremely untrusting husband.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.470
I saw dad again.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.200
I guess even in death, you're daddy's favorite.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.130
Don't lie to me.

20:16.130 --> 20:17.070
The first time that i saw dad,

20:17.070 --> 20:18.060
He told me that i had a brother.

20:18.140 --> 20:19.290
Every time i've seen him since,

20:19.290 --> 20:21.260
You haven't been far behind.

20:21.260 --> 20:22.000
So?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.630
So you've seen him, too.

20:23.630 --> 20:25.230
I knew there was something off.

20:25.230 --> 20:26.370
What are you talking about?

20:26.370 --> 20:28.220
The weakness, the confusion.

20:28.220 --> 20:29.900
He doesn't even look like other ghosts.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.260
And he keeps coming in and out of it

20:31.310 --> 20:33.660
As if he doesn't have any control, because he doesn't.

20:33.660 --> 20:35.180
You're not making any sense.

20:35.180 --> 20:38.450
Look, a ghost is controlling his body, ok?

20:38.450 --> 20:40.680
This whole time, i thought he was dead

20:40.680 --> 20:42.610
Because i was looking at his spirit,

20:42.610 --> 20:44.660
But- melinda?

20:50.640 --> 20:52.080
You're alive.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.310
My sweet, sweet girl.

20:57.870 --> 20:59.460
Yes, i'm here.

20:59.460 --> 21:02.530
And i'm just so sorry i've been gone for so long.

21:14.330 --> 21:15.570
I just...

21:16.610 --> 21:18.380
I can't believe it's you.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.430
Well, don't just stand there.

21:20.430 --> 21:22.430
See if your sister wants something to drink.

21:22.430 --> 21:24.410
I don't have much to offer.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.220
That's ok, i'm all set.

21:31.430 --> 21:33.730
Sweetheart, i just got in on a bus last night,

21:33.730 --> 21:35.550
Otherwise i would have called right away.

21:35.550 --> 21:38.770
But i had to rest, doctor's orders.

21:38.770 --> 21:39.940
What happened to your leg?

21:39.940 --> 21:42.080
Well, let's just say i had things on my mind

21:42.080 --> 21:43.820
When i should have been looking at the road.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.830
Hence the bus ride, heh.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.420
Hope you don't mind if i sit down.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.680
I'm supposed to stay off my feet.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.380
What's that face? You're looking at me like i was a-

22:00.380 --> 22:01.870
A ghost.

22:01.870 --> 22:06.970
I've-I've pictured your life like a million different ways,

22:07.470 --> 22:10.060
But the one thing i was always sure about was the end.

22:10.970 --> 22:12.750
You're supposed to be dead.

22:13.460 --> 22:16.740
Look, i can see how i've been like a phantom in your life-

22:16.740 --> 22:18.660
No, it's not about what i felt.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.890
It's about actually seeing your ghost.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.780
But, melinda- yeah, i know.

22:23.780 --> 22:26.270
You're alive, so i didn't see your ghost,

22:26.270 --> 22:28.890
But i-i still believed that it was your spirit.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.960
Your displaced spirit. My what?

22:30.960 --> 22:33.530
It happens when a ghost possesses another body.

22:33.530 --> 22:35.820
The displaced spirit wanders on its own.

22:36.260 --> 22:37.750
Possessed? I think i would know it.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.040
No, you wouldn't. That's the point, dad,

22:40.040 --> 22:41.950
You wouldn't remember any of it.

22:43.260 --> 22:44.770
Who could be doing this to you?

22:44.770 --> 22:46.830
Sweetheart, what are we talkin' about?

22:46.830 --> 22:48.660
I haven't seen my daughter in 20 years,

22:48.660 --> 22:50.230
And the first thing you want to discuss is-

22:50.230 --> 22:52.330
It has to do with paul eastman.

22:54.050 --> 22:55.470
Do you remember him?

22:55.470 --> 22:59.380
You sent him to prison because he killed that 10-year-old boy,Michael wilkins.

22:59.380 --> 23:00.420
Only he escaped,

23:00.420 --> 23:03.320
And i think that he wants to hurt other children,

23:03.320 --> 23:04.480
Or you.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.950
Melinda, i'm fine.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.490
I've put a lot of people in jail,

23:09.800 --> 23:12.120
And none of them have come after me.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.180
What got you on to all of this?

23:16.130 --> 23:17.430
A ghost...

23:17.430 --> 23:18.340
Sent me the case.

23:18.340 --> 23:19.740
At first, i thought it was michael.

23:19.740 --> 23:21.390
Lots of other ghosts have tried to stop me.

23:21.390 --> 23:22.890
Does this make any sense to you?

23:22.890 --> 23:24.020
Why on earth would it?

23:24.020 --> 23:26.130
Because your's tried to stop me

23:26.520 --> 23:27.580
Last night.

23:27.580 --> 23:32.230
You mean my- what'd you call it- displaced spirit?

23:34.220 --> 23:35.700
Does this mean anything to you?

23:36.210 --> 23:37.490
I have no idea.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.150
Sweetheart, i- i'm sorry.

23:39.150 --> 23:41.620
I wish i knew how to help you.

23:48.490 --> 23:49.840
Look, i'm...

23:50.190 --> 23:52.370
I'm not even gonna ask you

23:52.970 --> 23:54.620
Why you haven't contacted me before.

23:54.620 --> 23:56.190
That's your business.

23:56.190 --> 23:58.900
But i do want to know why you decided to come back now.

23:59.710 --> 24:01.160
I heard you were looking for me.

24:02.100 --> 24:06.130
I decided it was time to stop hiding from my mistakes,

24:06.130 --> 24:09.390
It's time to start being a father again.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.390
Well, i guess i should apologize.

24:13.580 --> 24:14.390
You're back.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.000
I guess it's just a shock.

24:18.620 --> 24:21.070
I hope we can have a second chance.

24:21.450 --> 24:23.350
There's so much i want to find out about you.

24:26.650 --> 24:27.890
I'd like to do that.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.040
My father is back in my life again for one hour,

24:45.040 --> 24:46.340
And this is our new relationship?

24:46.340 --> 24:48.600
I steal things from his room for evidence?

24:48.600 --> 24:49.920
Yeah, and with good reason.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.030
It's not even his name on the ticket.

24:51.030 --> 24:52.170
He's using an alias.

24:52.170 --> 24:53.630
What if he's in danger?

24:53.630 --> 24:55.920
What if i was right about everything except his death?

24:55.920 --> 24:57.830
What if he's using a fake name

24:57.830 --> 24:59.120
Because he's hiding from someone,

24:59.120 --> 25:00.480
Someone who he sent to prison?

25:00.480 --> 25:02.490
What if he's just lying to protect me?

25:02.490 --> 25:04.580
-You believe that?
-I don't know what to believe!

25:04.580 --> 25:05.790
'Cause none of it makes any sense.

25:05.790 --> 25:09.360
Why would his spirit warn me not to trust anyone,

25:09.360 --> 25:11.880
Even himself? And then i see him,

25:12.420 --> 25:15.830
And he hugs me, and he says "let's not be strangers,"

25:15.830 --> 25:19.940
Hey, look. Are you sure it was him you saw in that hotel

25:19.940 --> 25:21.230
And not some ghost possessing him?

25:21.230 --> 25:22.880
I'm as sure as i am about anything,

25:22.880 --> 25:24.240
Which isn't much.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.340
Do you want to know what i think?

25:28.340 --> 25:29.660
I already do.

25:30.260 --> 25:31.340
You want me to stay away from him.

25:31.340 --> 25:33.090
Right. Because...

25:33.540 --> 25:35.640
I have watched you every day

25:35.640 --> 25:37.160
Deal with horrible things;

25:37.160 --> 25:39.380
Terrible, painful things, and none of those,

25:39.380 --> 25:40.390
All of them put together,

25:40.390 --> 25:42.780
Have ever hurt you as much as this one man.

25:42.780 --> 25:44.700
But he just got here.

25:47.340 --> 25:50.370
And you want me to pretend like he never existed?

25:51.010 --> 25:53.400
I mean, don't i have a right to know who my father is;

25:53.400 --> 25:55.270
To know where he's been all these years?

25:55.270 --> 25:58.800
Of course you do, yes, but are you ready for the truth?

25:58.800 --> 26:02.130
I don't know, but i've gotta find out anyway.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.590
Mel...

26:03.590 --> 26:06.610
Look, i know it's hard to be married to me sometimes.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.080
I'll never say that.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.080
Just let me make it easier.

26:10.650 --> 26:13.950
Just help me find out what my dad's been up to.

26:13.950 --> 26:15.420
Use your doctor connections.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.630
Find out about that accident he was in.

26:18.630 --> 26:20.260
Help me figure out if he's been living

26:20.260 --> 26:23.270
As jeff king from cleveland.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.680
It's at least somewhere to start.

26:33.910 --> 26:35.070
You got it.

26:48.310 --> 26:49.870
How long are you planning to stay?

26:51.880 --> 26:54.290
As long as it takes to clean up this mess.

26:54.290 --> 26:55.720
I don't understand why you're so angry.

26:55.720 --> 26:56.930
I've done everything you asked.

26:56.930 --> 26:58.780
No, you haven't.

26:58.780 --> 27:02.420
Or she wouldn't be asking me these questions about paul eastman.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.680
There are ways to fix that if you'd let me.

27:04.680 --> 27:08.000
Where did i go wrong to make you hate your sister so much?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.680
You really need me to answer that?

27:11.340 --> 27:12.710
I have to go.

27:12.710 --> 27:14.440
You're on your own.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.530
Leave me alone, you hear me?

27:37.850 --> 27:39.530
I won't let you do this to me.

27:39.850 --> 27:40.960
I won't.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.090
Leave me alone!

27:45.090 --> 27:47.710
Mercy hospital, driscoll county.

27:47.710 --> 27:50.660
Yeah, mr. King's complaining of pain in his lower tibia.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.160
He says it's-he says it's from a car accident

27:53.160 --> 27:54.630
You guys treated him for.

27:55.490 --> 27:57.420
I'm going to need all the pathology records from that event,

27:57.420 --> 27:59.020
If you could send them to me.

27:59.020 --> 28:01.820
We do have some records on mr. King, yes.

28:01.820 --> 28:03.590
He's been to this hospital many times.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.760
His g.p.'s practice is here.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.270
Great. Uh, what can you tell me?

28:07.270 --> 28:10.350
He's been beaten up pretty badly, to be honest.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.540
A couple of falls, some contusions,

28:12.540 --> 28:14.590
Stitches to the elbows and knees.

28:14.590 --> 28:16.370
Lots of separate visits.

28:16.370 --> 28:18.330
So what can you tell me about the car accident?

28:18.330 --> 28:21.260
We have no record of anything auto-related.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.710
That's odd.

28:22.710 --> 28:24.580
It is and it isn't.

28:24.580 --> 28:25.380
How do you mean?

28:25.380 --> 28:27.170
Look, nothing came of it,

28:27.170 --> 28:29.580
But we have reporting standards here,

28:29.580 --> 28:34.190
And mr. King's file got sent to the c.p.d.

28:34.190 --> 28:38.220
The pattern suggested that someone was trying to hurt mr. King,

28:38.860 --> 28:40.860
Or he was hurting himself.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.510
Or both. I beg your pardon?

28:43.510 --> 28:46.010
Uh, nothing. Thanks a lot, thanks for your time.

29:53.490 --> 29:54.400
Don't get me wrong,

29:54.400 --> 29:56.730
There's lots of things i wish my father lied to me about.

29:56.730 --> 29:57.970
For example, i did not need to know

29:57.970 --> 30:00.450
He worked his way through medical school as a corpse beautician.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.870
I don't think he's lying,

30:01.870 --> 30:04.620
But i'm pretty sure he's hiding something.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.100
You don't think he's lying?

30:06.100 --> 30:08.750
Well, melinda, let's count all the things your father has told you

30:08.750 --> 30:10.120
That turned out to be true.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.670
Um, you know what, why don't you go first,

30:12.670 --> 30:14.170
'Cause i can't think of any.

30:14.170 --> 30:16.210
Look, i have lots of questions for my dad, too,

30:16.210 --> 30:18.430
Which i can ask him when he gets here for lunch.

30:18.740 --> 30:21.090
Lunch? That's nice.

30:21.760 --> 30:22.980
What?

30:22.980 --> 30:25.110
My dad used a lot of rogue on those people,

30:25.110 --> 30:27.590
But they were still stiffs.

30:28.330 --> 30:30.670
So you don't think i'll be able to tell if he's lying?

30:30.670 --> 30:32.700
You'll be able to tell. The question is, will you want to?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.570
Look, he has to tell me the truth, ok?

30:34.570 --> 30:35.760
He's obviously scared.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.550
He's been running from something for 20 years.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.290
I can help protect him.

30:40.290 --> 30:41.350
Protect him from what, melinda?

30:41.350 --> 30:43.020
You still don't know who possessed him,

30:43.020 --> 30:44.830
You don't know why you were shown that kid's ghost.

30:44.830 --> 30:47.160
No, but i know it has to be connected somehow.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.610
Michael wilkins, paul eastman, my father.

30:49.930 --> 30:52.070
I just have to figure out how.

30:52.740 --> 30:54.080
Hello?

30:54.980 --> 30:56.460
Dad, yeah, i was just-

30:56.460 --> 30:58.150
I'm not gonna be able to make it. I'm sorry.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.210
Really?

30:59.720 --> 31:01.200
Oh, i'm sorry to hear that.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.100
Yeah, i got some news.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.930
I hope it turns out to be good news.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.370
Bye, honey.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.200
He's at the doctor's.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.120
He got held up waiting for an appointment.

31:13.560 --> 31:17.970
Then why does it say grandview court hotel on the caller id, melinda?

31:17.970 --> 31:19.250
Come on.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.930
Are they giving free orthopedic exams

31:21.930 --> 31:24.390
With their tiny soaps and their pillow mints?

31:25.240 --> 31:28.670
You know, maybe this is hard for you to understand, but not everything's a joke.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.310
That man is my father.

31:33.070 --> 31:34.820
He means something to me.

31:34.820 --> 31:37.200
So go along with the lie or leave?

31:39.570 --> 31:41.540
That's your cue to say, "no, rick, stay.

31:41.540 --> 31:43.080
I value your judgment."

31:45.030 --> 31:46.840
Wow. Ok.

31:48.130 --> 31:50.090
For the record, i'm sorry if i hurt your feelings,

31:50.090 --> 31:52.120
But i don't take back what i said about your father,

31:52.120 --> 31:54.100
Because you're my friend and he hurt you,

31:54.100 --> 31:56.070
And that's not ok with me.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.770
And, you know, no matter what-

32:04.560 --> 32:06.210
My god, are you all right?

32:06.210 --> 32:07.900
Can't talk.

32:10.170 --> 32:11.410
Where did this come from?

32:11.410 --> 32:13.420
Need sympathy.

32:14.270 --> 32:15.300
Michael?

32:16.290 --> 32:17.780
Where are you? Slow down.

32:26.050 --> 32:27.200
Michael?

32:29.530 --> 32:30.960
What just happened?

32:30.960 --> 32:32.340
I had a vision.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.970
Did you know you could walk at the same time you have a vision?

32:34.970 --> 32:37.210
No. Well, you just did. You just vision-walked.

32:37.210 --> 32:38.670
I have to go.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.600
Someone just showed me how michael's body was found.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.230
But something's wrong.

32:44.740 --> 32:46.010
Yeah.

32:46.010 --> 32:47.060
I'll tell you what's wrong-

32:47.140 --> 32:49.300
You just vision-walked across my hand.

33:33.030 --> 33:34.830
This is your cape, isn't it?

33:35.110 --> 33:36.580
The one from the picture?

33:39.260 --> 33:40.580
It's not mine, you're wrong.

33:40.580 --> 33:41.770
It's somebody else's.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.010
What's going on?

33:43.360 --> 33:45.760
Your son's been hiding something you'll want to know.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.730
Michael, is that true?

33:50.460 --> 33:52.470
Someone led me to the cape,

33:52.470 --> 33:56.370
And they used your marbles to do it. See?

33:56.370 --> 33:58.620
At first i thought it was you, but then you didn't want me to be here.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.170
So it had to be somebody else,

34:00.170 --> 34:04.610
Like a ghost or maybe somebody who wanted me to think that they were you.

34:04.990 --> 34:06.460
Leave me alone.

34:06.460 --> 34:09.760
Who do you think would want me to find this cape, michael?

34:10.020 --> 34:11.989
There's something you're not telling me.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.190
Maybe it's something

34:14.250 --> 34:15.610
You don't even know that you know.

34:15.610 --> 34:16.820
I said leave me alone!

34:16.820 --> 34:18.449
I'm sorry, but i can't do that.

34:18.449 --> 34:19.870
'Cause people's lives are in danger,

34:19.870 --> 34:22.639
Including my father and maybe some kids just like you.

34:22.929 --> 34:24.980
Leave me alone, or i'll make you.

34:25.380 --> 34:26.889
I understand if you're scared.

34:26.889 --> 34:28.260
I'm not scared.

34:29.090 --> 34:30.510
But you should be.

34:32.949 --> 34:34.230
Michael?

34:34.560 --> 34:35.620
Where are you?

34:35.620 --> 34:37.050
No, no, this isn't right.

34:37.050 --> 34:38.679
You have to leave.

34:44.310 --> 34:46.050
I told her to leave me alone.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.659
Michael, baby, no!

34:49.659 --> 34:51.350
She's being rude.

34:51.350 --> 34:54.170
She's not listening.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.989
Leave me alone.

34:58.440 --> 35:01.780
Leave me alone!Leave me alone!

35:04.130 --> 35:05.300
Daddy?

35:05.820 --> 35:07.350
Go away!

35:08.180 --> 35:10.440
Tell your son to let go of his brother!

35:11.810 --> 35:13.930
If michael says you should leave, you should leave.

35:13.930 --> 35:16.760
I don't want her to leave!

35:17.170 --> 35:18.870
She'll just come back again!

35:18.870 --> 35:20.650
What are you talking about, honey?

35:20.650 --> 35:23.980
I want her to stop asking questions, forever!

35:23.980 --> 35:26.650
I want her to shut up, forever!

35:31.260 --> 35:32.080
Michael!

35:32.080 --> 35:33.420
Michael, stop it!

35:33.420 --> 35:35.280
All right? Let go of your brother!

35:36.090 --> 35:39.030
Look, you said that he was- he was too young to be alone.

35:39.030 --> 35:41.740
You were right, he needs a mother now.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.940
Michael! Let go!

35:43.940 --> 35:46.120
Right now, do you hear me?

35:47.620 --> 35:49.920
No more.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.620
What's a matter, mommy?

35:56.310 --> 36:00.130
I want you to let go of your brother.

36:00.430 --> 36:02.640
But i thought you liked being able to see me,

36:03.080 --> 36:04.380
And hold me.

36:04.380 --> 36:06.230
You said so.

36:06.230 --> 36:09.150
I know, sweetheart, and i do.

36:10.590 --> 36:13.830
But now is the time to let go.

36:28.090 --> 36:29.350
Mom?

36:33.830 --> 36:35.570
What's going on?

36:35.570 --> 36:37.050
It's ok.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.290
I'll explain everything.

36:40.510 --> 36:44.440
????

36:45.430 --> 36:47.520
He's only been able to-

36:48.260 --> 36:51.420
Go into other people for...

36:52.120 --> 36:53.720
A year or two.

36:54.150 --> 36:56.430
And i really didn't understand it at first,

36:56.430 --> 36:57.520
But...

36:58.610 --> 37:03.900
Yes, i knew he could do it, and i am so sorry, graham.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.060
All right.

37:05.980 --> 37:08.040
Yeah, we'll talk more about it later.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.890
I should go see how daisy's doing.

37:16.380 --> 37:17.690
I need to know what happened

37:17.690 --> 37:19.510
The day of the accident.

37:19.970 --> 37:21.340
Everything.

37:22.780 --> 37:24.490
I need to know everything.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.030
You said that you were a good boy.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.740
<i>you are a good boy.</i>

37:38.240 --> 37:39.250
You just need to tell us,

37:39.250 --> 37:40.890
Because somebody else got hurt that day,

37:40.890 --> 37:42.500
And i think you know who it was.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.460
I was playing superhero in the woods.

37:50.250 --> 37:53.690
Mommy always told me i shouldn't climb trees without an adult there,

37:53.690 --> 37:56.490
But i really wanted to fly.

37:56.490 --> 37:59.250
I climbed up pretty high, but then i got kinda scared,

37:59.250 --> 38:01.420
So i started to climb back down again,

38:01.420 --> 38:06.090
And my cape got stuck, and i guess my foot slipped.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.560
And the next thing i remember, i was on the ground.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.990
My cape was gone, but i didn't care about that.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.530
I was just thinking...

38:23.110 --> 38:25.010
"my mom's gonna be so mad at me."

38:26.570 --> 38:28.270
So it was an accident.

38:28.780 --> 38:30.170
Nobody hurt you.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.680
I don't understand.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.180
Yeah, i'm not sure that i do, either.

38:37.190 --> 38:42.130
Michael, the man who led the police to your body, paul eastman?

38:42.380 --> 38:43.830
How did he find you?

38:43.830 --> 38:45.640
Was that an accident, too?

38:46.100 --> 38:47.050
No.

38:48.170 --> 38:49.640
I showed him the way.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.050
How?

38:52.100 --> 38:53.000
Was there a trail,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.160
Like how i got led to your cape?

38:55.160 --> 38:56.360
No.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.770
I talked to him.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.890
How did- how did he hear you?I mean-

39:00.890 --> 39:02.880
The same way i'm talkin' to you.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.380
Please...

39:08.380 --> 39:09.460
What's he telling you?

39:09.460 --> 39:11.820
No, no, please don't tell her. She'll be so mad at me.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.250
No, she's not going to be mad at you.

39:14.250 --> 39:17.000
No, because you did the right thing.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.350
You told the truth.

39:18.350 --> 39:20.340
Even though you were really scared.

39:20.690 --> 39:21.600
That's right, sweetheart.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.910
I am-i'm so proud of you,

39:23.910 --> 39:25.360
No matter what.

39:28.390 --> 39:30.690
I want my mommy to hold me again.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.220
I want to feel her arms around me again.

39:38.090 --> 39:40.210
Michael, this may be hard for you to understand,

39:40.210 --> 39:42.250
But that can't happen anymore.

39:45.490 --> 39:48.060
There's another place that you belong,

39:48.060 --> 39:49.820
And your mommy, she-

39:50.740 --> 39:52.500
She wants you to go there.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.810
She'll be with you one day.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.300
Is that true, mommy?

40:02.300 --> 40:03.860
Is that true?

40:04.980 --> 40:07.450
You know what, it's hard for her to say so.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.330
Because...

40:11.340 --> 40:15.030
The one thing a parent never wants is to be away from their child.

40:15.030 --> 40:18.190
It's just... Sometimes it happens.

40:19.810 --> 40:21.860
Melinda's right, sweetheart.

40:23.540 --> 40:26.370
I've been so selfish keeping you with me.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.970
And there's another place where you belong.

40:32.110 --> 40:35.000
Nana and grandpa will be waiting for you there.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.630
They'll take care of you.

40:49.910 --> 40:51.440
Is that it?

40:53.450 --> 40:55.440
It's so bright, mom.

40:56.010 --> 40:57.890
He sees the light.

40:58.380 --> 41:00.100
But he's scared.

41:00.900 --> 41:03.140
Don't be frightened, sweetheart.

41:04.340 --> 41:05.590
You go on.

41:07.010 --> 41:08.280
You'll be ok.

41:10.170 --> 41:13.820
I- i think i see nana.

41:15.210 --> 41:16.510
He's going.

41:17.070 --> 41:18.390
It's ok.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.390
I'll be with you someday soon.

41:26.710 --> 41:27.990
He's gone.

41:33.590 --> 41:36.250
Wow.This is just getting stranger and stranger.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.720
Yeah, you're telling me.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.550
So the guy who found the kid's body,

41:39.550 --> 41:40.950
He could see ghosts, too?

41:40.950 --> 41:43.530
Yeah, i keep hearing grandview attracts us.

41:43.530 --> 41:44.860
I guess that's true.

41:44.860 --> 41:46.350
And when your father prosecuted him,

41:46.350 --> 41:47.390
He hadn't met your mother yet?

41:47.390 --> 41:49.200
My dad would have felt the same as anyone else,

41:49.200 --> 41:50.790
That paul eastman is crazy.

41:50.790 --> 41:52.920
He seemed crazy but was really innocent.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.780
But it doesn't tell me how this all started.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.640
I mean, who gave me that case number? Who gave me that vision?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.530
'Cause it couldn't have been anybody living.

42:02.350 --> 42:03.440
Wait a minute.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.730
What happens to someone

42:06.730 --> 42:08.640
When they have really bad burns?

42:08.640 --> 42:10.720
Well, the infection can spread real easily.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.600
You need ready access to antibiotics,

42:12.600 --> 42:14.850
You need water. That's how he died.

42:15.590 --> 42:17.260
Paul eastman is dead.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.690
He gave me that vision, he possessed my dad,

42:19.690 --> 42:20.720
All of it.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.680
He's just trying to get his revenge.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.150
But where do you hide when you're running from a ghost?

42:25.660 --> 42:26.800
I have to warn my dad.

43:19.030 --> 43:21.860
You know, he left his heart medicine at my house by accident.

43:21.860 --> 43:23.380
So if he doesn't answer,

43:23.890 --> 43:25.680
You might just have to let me in, all right?

43:25.680 --> 43:28.150
I prefer if i got a verbal ok from the hotel guest.

43:28.150 --> 43:29.330
Yeah, well, he may not be able-

43:29.330 --> 43:35.300
