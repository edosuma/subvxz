-Yes.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.320

-What a break.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.200
After how many years in the industry?
Ten, 15?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.960
-Twenty-eight.
-[gasps]

00:12.040 --> 00:14.920
Ha! I knew Craig'd choke it.
Too many stunts,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.680
and he's always looked like the villain.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.920
[mimics Sean Connery] Do you think
they'll expect me to talk?

00:20.960 --> 00:22.760
You won't do that, will you?

-Jane?
-[Jane]  Fucking idiot.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.720
You heard. Yeah, it wasn't great.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.639
-Clearly.
-No, I misjudged it.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.720
-I think I frightened some of them.
-Oh, Christ.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.280
Still, they'll realize
I'm the right man for the job

02:13.360 --> 02:15.200
when they see the other no-hopers.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.280
Oh, yeah. All right, see you.

-I'm in a phone box.
-What?

02:26.800 --> 02:28.560
I lost my mobile in an audition,

02:28.640 --> 02:31.920
but, luckily,
one of your prostitute cards is in here.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.640
Look, I can't make it tonight.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.240
I'm playing poker with Elaine Paige
and Lloyd Webber.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.000
But I'll see you tomorrow at 3 p.m.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.240

Three kings.
I believe it's your turn, Elaine Paige.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.280
Time to pull your winkle out,
as my gran used to say.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.480
Ha-ha! Excuse I!

03:01.560 --> 03:04.240
-[Elaine] I've got nothing.
-[Toast laughs evilly]

03:04.320 --> 03:07.640
Bad luck, EP.
Couldn't have happened to a nicer gal.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.720
So, Andrew Lloyd Webber,
looks like it's you and me.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.320
If I was you, I'd make this swift.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.760
No one wants to look like a top arsehole
in front of their floozy.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.680

Mm! Mm-mm-mm.
Forgotten something, Toast?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.480
I don't have any money for a taxi.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.800
[Andrew] I deign it for you
to have a pound. [laughs]

03:49.400 --> 03:52.600
[Elaine] You still owe Lloyd Webber
£20,000, Toast.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.840
Yeah? Well, you can tell Mr. Lloyd Webber,

03:54.920 --> 03:58.240
that he can shove that...
up his  Starlight Express.

this early?

04:17.200 --> 04:19.279
I have alarming news, Jane.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.200
To go with the alarming smell?

04:22.280 --> 04:25.920
It suddenly reeks of
a working men's club in here.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.240
Working men in this room?
That'd be a first!

04:28.320 --> 04:30.080
[Jane scoffs] You look dreadful, Toast.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.560
Please take your feet off my desk.
Where are your shoes?

04:33.160 --> 04:35.840

-Bloody poker.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.040
Well... [sighs]

I expect you'll be receiving a visit
from Michael Ball soon then.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.160
-Michael Ball?
-Yes.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.040
Ball is Lloyd Webber's enforcer.
Has been for years.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.160
Anyone owes LW money, Ball picks it up.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.240
Obviously he doesn't have to do it, but
it gives him something to do in the day

04:57.680 --> 04:59.840
-Shit!
-What now, Toast?

05:00.920 --> 05:04.160
I slept with Michael Ball's girlfriend,
not long after they split up.

-How long after?
-About ten minutes.

-Unusually attractive girl.

Great sense of humor, much like myself.
We laughed a lot.

-Well, he probably won't remember you.
-Why would you say that?

05:14.840 --> 05:17.200
In general, I've noticed people
tend not to remember you.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.800
-That's a hell of a pearl necklace.
-Shut up, Toast!

I didn't understand any of that, Jane.
It was just single words.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.480
Sorry, Toast. It needs to be dubbed
into English for eventual DVD release.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.680
They're offering £5,000.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.800
-I'll do it.
-Great.

-Don't have a problem playing gay, do you?
-Gay? No.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.520
I mean, I won't play a bald man, not even
on Radio 4, but I'm not gay sceptic.

-Let's go.
-OK. Well, good.

-What guy?
-The guy playing the other part.

-Who?
-Name's Ray Purchase. Do you know him?

Really terrific.

One note from the director. He really
wants you to pronounce it  unterpantzi.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.680
Really give it everything.

Thank you, man, it was great.

Great work, Ray. Thanks a lot.
Your taxi's outside.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.160
[Danny] Uh... OK.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.000
Steven, feeling here is that
you could play it just a little less gay.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.360
A little less gay?

10:29.440 --> 10:32.080
Yeah. Need to bring it down a bit,
you know.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.480
It's just a bit... a bit over the top.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.720
-It's a bit John Inman... It's a bit...
-[all laugh]

10:36.800 --> 10:38.160
It's a bit... a bit camp.

-OK, I'm off.
-What?

Yeah. You think I can't see you
laughing in there?

-[Toast] Yeah, you!

-Steven...
-You shut the fuck up, Clem Fandango!

10:54.680 --> 10:55.720
And your made-up name!

10:55.800 --> 10:58.000
All right, Steven, Steven.
We're not laughing at you.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.040
-It's just... It's something on YouTube.
-Give me your shoes.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.000
-[laughs] My shoes?
-Yeah, and my taxi fare.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.080
Take it off my fee.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.840
Fucking laugh at me, you motherfucker.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.960
-Luckily, I just bought another pair.
-[imitates Danny] Taxi fare!

11:18.040 --> 11:19.080
Fucking clown.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.800
[Mrs. Purchase]
Come on, you dirty bastard!

11:48.880 --> 11:50.120
[screams] Oh, Jesus!

11:50.200 --> 11:53.520
-Shit a brick, Mrs. Purchase!
-[Mrs. Purchase yelps]

11:53.600 --> 11:54.960
I think I'm losing my eyesight!

11:55.040 --> 11:58.880
-Oh, Jesus Christ, Toast! Oh!
-[Toast groans]

12:00.520 --> 12:03.120
-I actually have gone blind.
-Have you?

12:03.200 --> 12:06.080
No, it's come back.
God, I needed that and no mistaking.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.720
[Mrs. Purchase sighs]

12:07.800 --> 12:11.040
Last man who made love to me like that
had just got out of prison.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.320
If I wasn't stressed enough already,
then your husband turned up

12:14.400 --> 12:15.680
to the voice-over session.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.240
Oh, yeah. But he's away all afternoon.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.680
He's on some protest against gay marriage.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.480
He's notoriously homophobic.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.200
-Gah!
-Mm...

12:26.160 --> 12:30.120
Toast, since when
have you started wearing boy's trainers?

12:30.200 --> 12:33.240
-Since Lloyd Webber took my shoes.
-Well, where's the other one?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.080
I don't know.
It's the least of my problems.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.240
-Hm. You all right, Toast?
-No.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.640
Michael Ball is after me.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
No!

12:42.280 --> 12:43.560
-Yes.
-[gasps]

12:43.640 --> 12:48.160
One unusual fact about Michael Ball:
he has a vast amount of blood in his body.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.240
Really?

12:49.320 --> 12:52.160
I read somewhere he has double
the amount than your average person.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.240
Apparently, it helps him
belt out those power ballads.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.480
He'll be after your "bollards"
if you don't pay up.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.840
Yeah. He's probably waiting for me
at the theater. I'll be ready.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.200
Has your soppy husband
got any clean shirts?

13:03.280 --> 13:05.400
Yeah, on that chair over there.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.000
-[door opens]
-[Ray] You upstairs, darling?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.160
Oh, shit, it's Ray.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.760
[Ray] Not enough anti-gays
turned up at the protest.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.680
Ha! Good news for society,
bad news for Steven Toast.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.240
Quick! Under the bed, Toast.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.000
-Absolutely not.
-What?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.920
I'm not hiding from Ray Purchase.
It's about time we came clean.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.480
-[sighs]
-[Ray] Plimsolls? What's all this about?

13:26.560 --> 13:28.480
So, where is the young buck who... [gasps]

13:29.920 --> 13:31.720
-Toast!
-Purchase.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.680
Thought I could smell
cheap aftershave and bullshit!

13:35.760 --> 13:39.520
Ray, careful of your blood pressure.
Remember what Dr. Wo-Joe said.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.480
Toast. I may appear completely calm.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.400
However, inwardly I am, in fact, working
out exactly how I'm gonna kill you.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.160
And this time, I will kill you!
I shit thee nay!

13:49.240 --> 13:51.160
Oh, give it a rest, Ray.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.520
What have you done to the young stud
who was wearing these?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
Thought you'd have a three-piece, did you?

13:55.680 --> 13:57.000
-[laughs]
-A what?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.640
A threesome, you prat!

13:58.720 --> 14:00.200
[breathes heavily]

14:00.280 --> 14:02.800
Those trainers belong to Toast.
He's borrowed them.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.800
Who from, a 15-year-old?
So, where are your proper shoes?

14:05.880 --> 14:07.280
Andrew Lloyd Webber has them.

14:07.360 --> 14:12.440
What? Wait a second.
Are you wearing my shirt?

14:12.520 --> 14:15.400
All right, Purchase.
Now, if someone slept with my wife,

14:15.480 --> 14:20.400
I'd be equally irritated, but she is one
feisty, independently minded modern gal.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.840
She could sleep with whoever she pleases.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.760
Another woman, if it took her fancy.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.560
Hey, yeah! I'm cool with that.
Ray, what about--

14:27.640 --> 14:28.960
Never!

14:29.040 --> 14:31.720
[exhales] Now, if you wouldn't mind
getting out of my--

14:31.800 --> 14:34.560
-Oh, you're going nowhere, Toast.
-Oh, grow up, Ray.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.640
[fires shots]

14:41.200 --> 14:42.400
[whispers] Honestly.

14:43.560 --> 14:44.920
I'm serious, Toast.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm gonna kill you.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.200
What?

14:51.840 --> 14:55.520
I just always wondered why you walked
in such a strange manner.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.080
What the hell are you talking about?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.520
Well, did you know you had
one leg shorter than the other?

15:00.600 --> 15:01.880
No, I don't!

Yeah, I'm a lazy bitch.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.520
Yeah. Let's meet for coffee
in the morning. You can tell me

15:50.600 --> 15:53.320
all about your stepson's half brother.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.840
Talking of your café,
whatever happened to that young artist

15:56.920 --> 15:59.840
with the gorgeous arse
that used to come in on a Friday?
