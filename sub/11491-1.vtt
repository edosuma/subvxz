00:00.400 --> 00:02.200
Previously on:

00:02.400 --> 00:04.200
- So, how's Charlie doing?
- Oh, he's fine.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.800
Uh, actually, he's engaged.

00:05.900 --> 00:09.000
You told her I was engaged?
Why the hell would you do that?!

00:09.100 --> 00:11.600
Charlie, there's a woman
named Mia on the phone.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.800
I'll take it.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.200
Hi, Charlie.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.100
Mia.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.000
and now

00:23.800 --> 00:25.900
So, how are you?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.200
- Great. How are you?
- Fine, fine.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.000
Still engaged.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.500
Come, sit, join us.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.700
- Are you sure I'm not interrupting?
- No, no, of course not.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.800
Yeah, his fiancée just left.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.300
Oh, I'm sorry I missed her.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.700
Oh, I bet she's still out in
the parking lot. I'll go get her.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.900
So...

00:46.800 --> 00:48.600
what's going on with you
these days? You still dancing?

00:48.700 --> 00:50.600
Not so much. I'm a little
old for ballet now.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.300
Oh, that can't be right.
You look great.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.800
Young and vibrant and...

00:56.200 --> 00:57.500
taut.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.100
You know who else
has a great body?

01:00.200 --> 01:01.500
Charlie's fiancée.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.200
In fact, Charlie calls
her boobalicious.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.900
I'm really happy you
found somebody, Charlie.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.400
Thank you. She's great.
Really, really great.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.000
Boobalicious.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.300
So if you're not dancing,
what are you up to?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.800
Well, believe it or not,
I'm trying for a singing career.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.600
No kidding. That's terrific.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.600
You know who's
a wonderful singer?

01:22.700 --> 01:23.900
Charlie's fiancée?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Uh, actually, I was gonna
say Ms. Celine Dion.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.400
I have no idea about Chelsea.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.700
Although she does have
a set of lungs on her.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.400
Right.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.900
So listen, I'm putting together
a demo of some songs.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.100
Any chance you could help me with
the arrangements, maybe play piano?

01:41.700 --> 01:42.800
Oh, wow.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.400
That sounds like fun.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.900
It's just, you know, kind of
awkward 'cause, you know...

01:49.000 --> 01:50.900
He's getting married.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.500
Maybe I can find
you somebody else.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.500
That'd be terrific.
Let me give you my number.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.200
Are you still at 696-336-725?

01:59.300 --> 02:01.200
Yeah, I can't believe
you remember it.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.300
Well, I have a little
memory trick.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.800
If you change the numbers to letters,
it spells out "oxofempal."

02:08.000 --> 02:09.800
Oh, good trick.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.300
I should get going.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.700
Wonderful to see you again.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.100
Same here.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.500
- You too, Alan.
- Bye-bye.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.300
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

02:23.200 --> 02:24.700
I've missed you.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.700 --> 02:36.200
Oxofempal?

02:40.100 --> 02:42.500
Hot, hot, hot! Ow!

02:46.100 --> 02:48.200
You have to dial one first.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.200
Hey, Berta, what do you
know about Percocet?

03:03.700 --> 03:08.500
I know three of them with a Mickey's big mouth
can make you run buck naked through a Taco Bell.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.100
Why do you ask?

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200
Well, my mom says Grandma Lenore can't hold
the new baby until she stops popping them.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.300
That's probably a good idea.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.700
You drop one kid, you gain
a reputation as a kid dropper.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.800
So how do you like
having a new baby sister?

03:23.900 --> 03:25.900
Well, she eats,
she sleeps, she poops.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.600
So far I'm not impressed.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.200
Give her a bad haircut
and she'd be you.

03:32.100 --> 03:35.300
Excuse me, but I paid
nine bucks for this haircut.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.300
Sorry.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.700
Besides, the baby doesn't
look anything like me.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.700
In fact, she doesn't look like
my mom or my stepdad either.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.600
Who does she look like?

03:45.700 --> 03:49.500
Kind of like a girl
version of my dad.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.200
I thought your dad was
the girl version of your dad.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.100
I'm telling you,
Charlie, it's a bad idea.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.300
What's the big deal?

04:00.400 --> 04:01.900
I'm just gonna find
her a piano player.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.600
Oh, come on, I saw the way
you looked at her.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.000
You say "piano player,"
but you mean organist.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.400
Oh, that's ridiculous.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.600
I'm engaged to Chelsea. I'm living
with Chelsea. I'm in love with Chelsea.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.000
- What's Chelsea's phone number?
- What?

04:14.900 --> 04:17.300
What does it spell?
You know, your little memory trick.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.000
Oh, uh...

04:19.399 --> 04:22.700
it's... jklpuzo.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.400
Really?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.100
Let's, uh, let's test it out.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.000
Uh, is that, uh, 818-jklpuzo

04:30.300 --> 04:33.200
or, uh, 310-jklpuzo?

04:33.600 --> 04:35.300
All right, all right,
I-I made it up.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.300
But I don't have to
call Chelsea; she lives here.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.200
You don't have to
call Mia either.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.400
Oh, yeah?

04:40.800 --> 04:41.900
Well, what about you and Melissa?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.800
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Nothing! I'm changing the subject to your peccadilloes.

04:47.500 --> 04:51.800
You were banging Melissa in the hospital storage closet
while your ex-wife was giving birth to your daughter!

04:51.900 --> 04:54.900
- We don't know she's my daughter.
- Who's your daughter?

04:58.100 --> 05:00.500
You're my daughter,
I'm your daughter!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.700
This whole court is
out of daughter!

05:06.500 --> 05:07.600
Al Pacino?

05:08.500 --> 05:09.900
Great movie.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.500
Hoo-ah!

05:14.000 --> 05:15.300
See that one?

05:18.900 --> 05:20.100
That was close.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.500
Good thing he's slow.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.200
Yeah, well, Judith's mom
dropped him when he was a baby.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.500
Wow.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.100
Yeah.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.500
What brought that on?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.200
You're the one who
started talking dirty.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.200
All I said is,
"What'd you do today?"

05:47.700 --> 05:50.000
There you go again,
you nasty girl.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.800
Okay, seriously,
what did you do today?

05:56.700 --> 05:57.500
Nothing.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.900
Just a regular day.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.600
Had coffee with you,
hung out with Alan a little bit,

06:02.700 --> 06:05.600
then came home, had
a drink, took a nap,

06:05.700 --> 06:08.500
next thing I know you're walking in
the front door with your whore talk.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.800
All right, whatever.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.000
Oh, yeah, there was
one other thing.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.400
Really?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.300
Yeah, I ran into an old buddy.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.900
What's her name?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.500
Her? Why do you assume it's a her?

06:23.100 --> 06:26.900
When you've seen one of your old guy friends,
you don't try to hump me into a coma.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.800
Fair point.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.200
It was Mia.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.100
Mia, the old buddy
you almost married?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.100
Yeah.

06:37.900 --> 06:38.900
And?

06:39.100 --> 06:40.600
And nothing.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.500
Well, she did ask me if I'd help her
out with this music thing she's doing.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.800
- But I said no.
- How come?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.100
I thought it'd be inappropriate.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.000
Why? You still have
feelings for her?

06:52.600 --> 06:54.500
No, no, of course not.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.200
Then why wouldn't
you help her out?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.600
What?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I mean, if she's just a friend,
then why would it be inappropriate?

07:04.500 --> 07:05.900
Okay.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.800
Uh, no reason.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.900
So you're saying
I should help her out?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.900
Unless you still
have feelings for her.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.000
- I guess I'll help her.
- Good.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.600
Good.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.300
Or bad.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.400
Probably bad.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.100
I'm gonna go with bad.

07:37.700 --> 07:38.900
Hi, Charlie!

07:39.700 --> 07:42.400
We were just having a little
moonlight skinny dip in the ocean.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.700
Good thinking.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.700
Nothing more romantic than seaweed
hanging from a cold, shriveled penis.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.900
There's no seaweed--
Oh, my...

07:54.800 --> 07:56.600
Don't put it on the table!

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
Sorry.

07:58.700 --> 08:03.800
Alan, what do you say we take a hot shower
and un-shrink the Snuffleupagus?

08:04.300 --> 08:05.300
He'll be fine.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.400
It's Bert and Ernie
I'm worried about.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.100
I think Bert has
ascended to my rib cage.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.300
You go ahead.
I'll be right there.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.700
- Okey-doke.
- Okay.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.100
Hey, uh, can I
ask you something?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.400
I am not gonna help you
find your missing testicle.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.800
No, no, it's about Melissa.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
What about her?

08:23.300 --> 08:25.500
Well, now that we're
seeing each other again,

08:25.600 --> 08:28.600
the fact that she still lives with
her mom presents kind of a problem.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.400
Why? 'Cause you
tickled mom's Elmo?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.200
It was just light necking.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.200
I never touched her Elmo.

08:36.900 --> 08:37.700
Anyway,

08:37.799 --> 08:40.799
since you set the precedent of
having girlfriends move in here,

08:40.900 --> 08:43.100
- uh, I was wondering if maybe...
- No.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.800
Why not? You let
Chelsea move in.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.400
It's my house.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.900
You are a guest.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.200
And by "guest," I mean leech
I tolerate until our mother dies

08:52.300 --> 08:55.500
and she can't lay a guilt trip on me
for kicking your ass to the curb.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.100
You're gonna kick me
out when Mom dies?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.500
You're planning on being
here until Mom dies?

08:59.700 --> 09:02.000
Okay, okay, we're
getting off subject.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.700
What about Jake?
You let Jake move in.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.200
You're not helping
your case here, Alan.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.500
- But I'm just saying...
- I said no!

09:12.300 --> 09:14.500
Hmm. Hey, Bert, welcome back.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.100
* You'll never find *

09:30.600 --> 09:33.300
* As long as you live *

09:34.400 --> 09:36.600
* Someone who loves you *

09:37.300 --> 09:40.800
* Tender like I do *

09:43.600 --> 09:46.000
* You'll never find *

09:47.800 --> 09:50.200
* No matter where you search *

09:51.300 --> 09:53.900
* Someone who cares about you *

09:54.000 --> 09:57.700
* The way I do *

09:59.700 --> 10:02.800
* Whoa, I'm not bragging
on myself, baby *

10:03.900 --> 10:07.700
* 'Cause I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else *

10:07.900 --> 10:12.500
* No... one else. *

10:17.100 --> 10:19.900
That's a pretty mouth,
but it ain't made for singing.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.900
- What's it made for?
- Eating.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.800
Oh.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.400
I thought maybe
she meant oral sex.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.000
* You're gonna miss my lovin' *

10:30.100 --> 10:36.300
* You're gonna miss,
miss, miss my love. *

10:38.700 --> 10:40.000
So?

10:40.800 --> 10:41.800
Wow.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.500
- You want to run it again?
- I don't.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.800
I mean, there's a danger
of over-rehearsing it.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.300
Yeah. Plus I kind of
nailed it, right?

10:51.700 --> 10:54.000
I don't see it
getting any better.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.900
That is so sweet, Charlie.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.200
Thank you.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.600
I don't know how
I'd do this without you.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.400
Hey, I don't deserve any credit.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.000
God gave you that voice.
I had nothing to do with it.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.500
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hey, hi!

11:09.200 --> 11:10.600
There she is!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.600
Chelsea, this is Mia.
Mia, this is Chelsea.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.100
- Hi.
- Hi!

11:14.500 --> 11:15.700
We were just rehearsing.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.500
What? No-no, no,
there's nothing to interrupt.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.900
She's singing,
I'm playing piano,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.600
Alan, Berta and Jake are
right there in the kitchen.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.100
Guys, Chelsea's home.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.400
Yay.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.600
- I should get going.
- Good.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.000
I mean, you don't
have to, but good.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.300
Rehearsal was good.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.400
You've got yourself
a terrific guy here.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.800
- I know. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.900
- I'll see you Saturday at the studio?
- You bet.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.300
* You'll never find... *

11:42.400 --> 11:44.200
No, no, save your voice.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.000
Yikes.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.800
So, how'd it go?

11:52.500 --> 11:54.900
Well, uh, how can I put this?

11:55.200 --> 12:00.000
She's the picture you stick on the cover of
an album by a fat girl who can actually sing.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.700
That's not what I mean.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.700
Were there any, you know, sparks?

12:04.800 --> 12:07.200
No, no sparks.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.900
Why would there be sparks?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.800
I'm with you. We're engaged.

12:10.900 --> 12:14.000
We're gonna be married.
You and me, that's the sparks...

12:15.000 --> 12:16.200
baby.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.800
Relax, Charlie, I trust you.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.000
Okay, lady, you're really
starting to piss me off.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.600
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

12:33.700 --> 12:37.500
No problem, Charlie, as long as you're
willing to pay my weekend rates.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.000
You've got weekend rates?

12:40.100 --> 12:42.400
Yep, and you probably don't
want to waste time haggling.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.600
Now, what's the big emergency?

12:46.700 --> 12:50.100
Well, you might not think it's
a big emergency, but trust me, it is.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.300
Okay.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.600
I'm really constipated.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.400
You do realize which end of
the body I specialize in?

12:58.900 --> 13:00.900
I know, I knowI'm not
here for an enema.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.400
Good, because that couch
isn't Scotchguarded.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.700
I'm thinking it's psychosomatic
'cause I've tried coffee,

13:08.800 --> 13:13.700
fiber, laxatives and something
my housekeeper said was a suppository,

13:13.800 --> 13:17.000
but I now suspect
was a practical joke.

13:17.700 --> 13:21.800
All right,
so psychosomatic constipation.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.800
Good name for rock band, huh?

13:24.200 --> 13:26.100
Weekend rates, Charlie.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.900
Tell me what's going on in your life.
How are things with you and your fianc?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.100
Great, great! She lives with me now.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.100
We're planning the wedding.
Couldn't be better.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.100
Good. And how's work?

13:37.400 --> 13:38.600
Well, it's been pretty slow,

13:38.700 --> 13:40.500
but thankfully,
the house is paid off,

13:40.600 --> 13:43.300
my pension is funded,
and I've given up prostitutes.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.600
So, really, all I need is drinking money,
and what's that, a couple grand a month?

13:47.700 --> 13:49.300
That sounds about right.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.800
Hey, do you remember Mia?

13:51.900 --> 13:53.600
Your ex-fianc?the dancer.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.700
Wow, you remember.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.400
I'm not sitting here
sketching ponies, Charlie.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.500
- Anyway, I ran into her.
- Really? And how'd that go?

14:03.600 --> 14:06.000
Fine, fine. She looks great,

14:06.100 --> 14:08.300
she's single again,
told me she missed me.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.200
Uh-huh.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.800
I always dig that.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.700
Then she asked me if I could help her out
with this music project, and I said no.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.200
But then Chelsea said if I didn't still
have feelings for her, why not do it?

14:20.300 --> 14:21.600
So I did it.

14:21.700 --> 14:24.300
Interesting. When did
all this happen?

14:24.400 --> 14:25.500
Three of four days ago.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.000
And how long have
you been constipated?

14:28.700 --> 14:30.500
I don't know.
Three, four days.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.700
Hey, you think
there's a connection?

14:34.900 --> 14:36.600
I'm leaning that way.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.000
Look, Charlie, you obviously
still have feelings for Mia,

14:40.100 --> 14:41.800
and yet you're
committed to Chelsea.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.300
It's an emotional conflict,

14:43.400 --> 14:47.400
and until you resolve that conflict,
you're going to be physically blocked.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.600
English, please?

14:48.700 --> 14:51.100
As soon as you pick one,
you can go two.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.900
What happens if I can't pick?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.800
I don't know. C-section?

15:03.600 --> 15:06.600
Anyway, she said I have to
resolve the conflict

15:06.700 --> 15:10.300
because my emotions are
strongly connected to my lower intestine.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.700
That makes a certain
amount of sense.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.200
You think with your penis,
and your head's up your ass.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.900
The baby just came!

15:20.500 --> 15:21.300
Baby?

15:21.400 --> 15:25.000
Well, it's not technically a baby,
but we know it's gonna look like you.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.400
Hey, Charlie

15:29.000 --> 15:30.100
Hey.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.800
What's she still doing here?

15:35.900 --> 15:37.600
Not still. She went away,
she came back.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.100
She's not moving in, Alan.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.100
Of course not.
You said no, it's no.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.100
We're out of milk, sweetie.
I'm gonna run to the market.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.300
Okay.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.000
She likes milk.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.000
So how are you gonna
resolve your conflict?

15:52.100 --> 15:53.400
I'm not sure.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.200
I may have to sleep with Mia.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.500
What?!

15:57.300 --> 15:59.200
Okay, here's the deal.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.400
If I back out of
the recording session with Mia,

16:03.500 --> 16:05.900
Chelsea will think I still
have feelings for her.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.800
All right.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.800
However, if I spend any more time
with Mia without sleeping with her,

16:09.900 --> 16:11.700
I'm gonna split open
like a roasted pistachio.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.500
Nobody wants that!

16:14.300 --> 16:17.600
Charlie, cheating on Chelsea makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever.

16:17.700 --> 16:21.200
That's what I thought,
but my shrink was pretty adamant.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.100
Just promise if
anything happens to me,

16:27.300 --> 16:29.100
you'll raise it as your own.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.400
* Down in Louisiana *

16:38.300 --> 16:41.700
* Where the alligators
grow so mean *

16:42.600 --> 16:46.100
* Lived a girl that
I swear to the world *

16:46.200 --> 16:48.900
* Made the alligators
look tame *

16:49.000 --> 16:51.100
* Poke salad Annie *

16:53.400 --> 16:56.400
I know, I know it's hard
to believe I'm not banging her.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.200
Then why are we here?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.600
She's an old friend.
I'm helping her out.

17:02.700 --> 17:05.599
You really want to help her out?
Sneak up behind her with a big rock.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.500
Detox?

17:09.599 --> 17:11.700
No, constipated.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.500
'Cause you're detoxing?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
- Can we just do this?
- Fine.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.200
* 'Cause your mama was
working on the chain gang *

17:23.900 --> 17:25.000
* Poke *

17:26.700 --> 17:27.900
* Salad.*

17:29.800 --> 17:31.600
That one felt really good.

17:31.700 --> 17:35.000
Okay, help me understand something.
You're hoping to bang her, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.500
Can I hear a little?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.200
Sure. Play it back.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.900
* Down in Louisiana *

17:54.000 --> 17:55.200
That's me?

17:55.600 --> 17:56.900
That's you.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.400
Wow.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.600
I had no idea I was so good.

18:05.900 --> 18:09.200
Oh, Charlie, I'm so happy!

18:09.400 --> 18:12.400
Oh, well, if you're happy, I'm happy.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.700
Why did I ever let you go?

18:16.800 --> 18:19.200
If I recall, you had
a list of reasons.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.700
Well, I was wrong.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
How can I make it up to you?

18:22.500 --> 18:25.700
Um, how do you want
to make it up to me?

18:27.900 --> 18:29.000
Wow.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.100
There it is.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.300
Let's do this last track,
and then we can go back to my place.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.900
Maybe we can sweeten
her vocals with some reverb,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.200
a little echo,
lay a little guitar over it?

18:47.300 --> 18:50.400
We can lay car horns and barking
dogs over it. It won't help.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.500
I'm ready.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.700
Just relax and feel
the groove, okay?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.200
I got it.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.900
Okay, this is "Boogie-woogie
Bugle Boy." Take one.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.400
* He was a famous trumpet man
from out Chicago way *

19:14.500 --> 19:17.000
* He had a boogie style that
no one else could play, whoo! *

19:17.100 --> 19:19.200
* He was the top man
at his craft *

19:19.500 --> 19:21.900
* And then his number came up,
and he was going to the draft *

19:22.000 --> 19:24.500
* He's in the army now,
blowing reveille *

19:24.600 --> 19:27.400
* He's the boogie-woogie
bugle boy of Company B *

19:27.800 --> 19:29.400
Okay, Mia, hold it,
hold it a sec.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.800
Is something wrong?

19:31.300 --> 19:34.700
Yeah, kind of. You can't sing.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.600
What?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.400
You got no talent.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.200
I'm sorry, but we're
both wasting our time here.

19:41.300 --> 19:45.300
I love Chelsea. I'm gonna marry her,
and I can't see you anymore.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.100
Are you kidding?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.300
You can't just walk
out on me! You...

19:51.200 --> 19:53.000
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.500
- Thanks.
- No,thank you.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.500
I should have known this would happen,
you lowlife son of a bitch!

20:01.600 --> 20:04.100
Uh, the lowlife son
of a bitch is gone,

20:04.200 --> 20:08.100
but I think you have a real gift,
and we shod work together.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.500
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.200
You might want to
give it a minute.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.700
You were in there
with your guitar?

20:20.800 --> 20:23.400
You never know when
inspiration might strike.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.500
That's called "Two Burritos
and a Root Beer Float."

20:43.800 --> 20:45.700
Hey...??

20:46.500 --> 20:48.000

20:49.700 --> 20:51.900

- OK.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.300
