WEBVTT

00:05.381 --> 00:08.214
What are you up to?

00:10.636 --> 00:12.297
Crichton?

00:12.388 --> 00:13.343
Yep?

00:13.431 --> 00:15.296
What are you doing?

00:15.391 --> 00:16.927
Playing a game.

00:19.979 --> 00:22.220
Doesn't seem like much
of a challenge.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.473
Depends on how you play.

00:29.739 --> 00:32.025
You were mumbling, again.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.284
l was thinking.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.403
About what?

00:37.413 --> 00:39.529
...to remember me by, Crichton.

00:39.624 --> 00:41.330
( screaming )

00:41.834 --> 00:43.210
Nothing.

00:44.295 --> 00:45.876
(sighing)

00:45.963 --> 00:48.249
Crichton, you've told me
yourself that your species
isn't accustomed

00:48.341 --> 00:50.127
to being in space for long
periods of time.

00:50.218 --> 00:54.177
Now, I have seen cases of
transit madness before and
if you're cracking up...

00:54.263 --> 00:56.219
Aeryn...
-I want to know.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.597
I'm fine.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.470
I don't want to talk about it.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.601
(sighing)

01:02.688 --> 01:05.350
The human doesn't want to talk.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.402
Zhaan:
D'Argo and Chiana
are busy, Rygel.

01:11.489 --> 01:14.356
What? They ran out of places
to defile up here,

01:14.450 --> 01:16.987
so they had to do it in
a Transport Pod.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.410
Unfortunately for them,
nothing so enjoyable.

01:19.497 --> 01:24.742
They've learnt that organic
goods from this region are
often contaminated by parasites.

01:24.835 --> 01:28.669
So they're looking for a local
cure in case there's an
infestation on Moya.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.168
Parasites? What kind?

01:31.259 --> 01:33.921
I don't have any details yet
but I suppose that's
the price you pay

01:34.011 --> 01:37.219
for trading in such a
prosperous system.
-Hal Prosperous?

01:37.306 --> 01:43.222
Is that what you call three
planets filled with
nothing but miserable, mud grubbing farmers?

01:59.245 --> 02:02.829
Our parasite problems
are solved.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.122
Rygel's decided to leave
us then, has he?

02:05.209 --> 02:06.574
Not likely.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.580
We don't know if we even have
a parasite problem.

02:08.671 --> 02:11.287
Well, that's what this
little guy will tell us.

02:11.382 --> 02:12.872
(laughing)

02:15.344 --> 02:16.333
Aeryn:
What is that?

02:16.429 --> 02:18.715
It's a Vorc.
Cute, huh?

02:18.806 --> 02:22.264
D'Argo:
We had some problems with our
translator microbes and the local merchants,

02:22.351 --> 02:27.141
but from what we can gather,
this little fellow homes in on
one specific parasite

02:27.231 --> 02:28.516
and eradicates it.

02:28.607 --> 02:32.691
Oh, look.
He's smelling something.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.155
A vendor told us about this
ship that was infested.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.402
The parasites killed everyone
on board, over 200 people.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.859
and all they left behind were
these... these cocoons or...

02:41.954 --> 02:43.785
Cocoons.
-eggs or something.

02:43.873 --> 02:46.410
If the parasites are that
dangerous we should
jettison the food

02:46.500 --> 02:48.286
and solve the problem
before it starts.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.368
When you see what this
little fellow can do...

02:54.342 --> 02:55.081
Aw...

02:55.176 --> 02:56.291
(squealing)

02:58.262 --> 03:00.253
Come back here!

03:00.348 --> 03:02.213
Yep, that's impressive.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.358
Goodness, let the pig dog eat!

03:11.442 --> 03:14.650
He's a Cinderella boy.

03:16.072 --> 03:18.404
Oh my, Bob, this is a...

03:18.491 --> 03:21.107
this is a big chance for
the kid from the
Uncharted Territories.

03:21.202 --> 03:24.194
He's about two feet off the
green here on the 18th,

03:24.288 --> 03:25.744
three strokes off the lead.

03:25.831 --> 03:29.039
The question is, will he chip,
or will he use the putter?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.787
( soft growl )

03:35.257 --> 03:36.633
Sparky?

03:39.595 --> 03:41.301
Yo Ryg, that you?

03:44.183 --> 03:44.968
Rygel?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.094
(roaring)

03:46.185 --> 03:47.300
Whoa!

03:59.990 --> 04:02.151
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.406
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.158
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:08.249 --> 04:11.833
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.669
Help me.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.209
Listen, please.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.161
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:16.257 --> 04:20.296
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.752
I'm doing everything I can.

04:22.847 --> 04:25.680
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.322
Crichton:
I'm telling you, whatever
it was it was going through the food.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.153
Have you considered the
possibility that you
just saw Rygel?

04:49.248 --> 04:51.330
He's been hoarding food!
-It wasn't Rygel.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.783
Maybe it was one of those
parasites. We never get did get
a good description of them.

04:53.878 --> 04:56.244
You said you fired at it while
it was in this compartment,
right?

04:56.338 --> 04:58.590
-Yeah.
There's no other way out of
there. Where did it go?

04:58.674 --> 05:00.005
I don't know.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.299
Rygel:
Get away from there.
That food belongs to me.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.297
That food is for all of us.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.221
Oh! What is that foul odor?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.299
It's Vorc urine.
Would you like a whiff?

05:09.393 --> 05:10.257
( muffled scream )

05:10.352 --> 05:11.933
What's a Vorc?

05:12.021 --> 05:15.229
It is a predator that
kills parasites!

05:15.316 --> 05:17.102
Chiana's with it.
It's hunting right now.

05:17.193 --> 05:20.481
Whatever it is, it'd better
stay away from my food.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.186
Crichton:
Hey, maybe that's what
I saw. A Vorc.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.988
It was about, naked,
with a face like this.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.361
No, no. It was more like
tandoori chicken.

05:27.453 --> 05:30.286
Pilot, can you spare the
DRDs for a search?

05:30.372 --> 05:32.283
Of course, Commander.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.336
( heavy breathing )

05:54.522 --> 05:56.387
( footsteps scurrying )

06:09.620 --> 06:11.201
(sighs)

06:15.209 --> 06:16.540
(sighs)

06:17.711 --> 06:19.212
( rustling )

06:20.881 --> 06:22.382
(footsteps thudding )

06:24.218 --> 06:25.628
( heavy breathing )

06:40.276 --> 06:42.062
( horrified gasp )

06:43.279 --> 06:44.485
Zhaan?

06:45.364 --> 06:46.114
Zhaan?

06:46.198 --> 06:47.187
Did you get the cage?

06:47.283 --> 06:48.898
Uh, yeah.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.733
But I don't think the Vorc
likes it very much.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.739
Well, what does he like?

06:52.830 --> 06:56.618
Well, so far, everything,

06:56.709 --> 06:58.324
but parasites.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.454
Come on, little...

06:59.545 --> 07:00.910
what's his name?

07:01.005 --> 07:03.963
Well | couldn'tjust name him,
Zhaan. He's a free spirit.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.664
I mean, you can
appreciate that.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.126
While I believe it's wrong to
imprison any living creature,

07:09.221 --> 07:10.336
( sniffing )

07:13.142 --> 07:15.349
there are always exceptions.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.191
Now!

07:36.957 --> 07:38.948
This thing should be
out hunting.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.034
You can play with it later.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.459
Did it look like I was playing?

07:42.546 --> 07:45.413
Yes. This thing needs to
earn its keep.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.257
(shrieking)

07:46.342 --> 07:48.458
Ow!

07:48.552 --> 07:50.213
lt frelling bit me.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.885
That little...

07:52.681 --> 07:54.217
(shrieking)

07:54.308 --> 07:56.720
Crichton:
All right then, what about
the access shafts?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.222
Pilot:
The DRDs are searching
those areas,

07:59.313 --> 08:03.852
but so far there's no evidence
of any creature like the one
you've described.

08:03.942 --> 08:08.060
I'm beginning to doubt whether
we'll find anything at all.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.486
Why?

08:09.573 --> 08:13.907
Officer Sun mentioned that
you've been distracted lately.

08:13.994 --> 08:18.203
She's believes it's possible
that you broke into
Rygel's food cache

08:18.290 --> 08:24.456
and fired at an imaginary enemy
while playing some
sort of... game.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.379
It's golf.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.253
Would you believe it's possible
that Aeryn doesn't know

08:30.344 --> 08:32.300
what the hell it is she's
talking about?

08:32.388 --> 08:35.721
l have never known her
to exaggerate.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.719
Have you, Crichton?

08:39.895 --> 08:41.396
Crichton?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.233
( soft rattling )

08:54.368 --> 08:56.279
( rattling )

09:01.041 --> 09:02.906
(clattering )

09:10.384 --> 09:12.295
( rattling )

09:31.113 --> 09:32.193
Yotz!

09:32.281 --> 09:34.146
Rygel!

09:34.241 --> 09:35.742
What the hell are you doing?

09:35.826 --> 09:37.566
It's a cargo bay.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.447
l was checking my cargo.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.200
l was told we had
parasites on board.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.249
Now, would you care to explain
why you were trying to kill me?

09:45.335 --> 09:50.420
Look, I thought you were that
thing that I saw earlier.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.168
Sorry.

09:52.259 --> 09:56.252
Yoo-hoo! Little Vorc thingy.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.632
Little Vorc?

10:01.727 --> 10:03.763
D'Argo, the Vorc got
away from me.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.266
Again?
You have to stay with it.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.857
Oh, easy for you to say.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.273
It hasn't stopped running around
the ship since it got here.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.191
That's how it hunts.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.646
Well yeah, I know, but I'm
starting to get a little tired
of following it around.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.153
Listen, if we do have a
parasite on board,

10:18.243 --> 10:20.825
we need to know what it
looks like, which means...

10:20.913 --> 10:22.153
Follow the Vorc.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.364
Fine. You follow it.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.371
(mimics Chiana ):
"Fine. You follow the Vorc."

10:37.679 --> 10:39.180
(squishing)

10:41.433 --> 10:42.969
( groans )

10:45.145 --> 10:46.806
(whimpering)

10:52.861 --> 10:54.442
Get...

10:55.405 --> 10:57.236
off...

10:57.825 --> 10:59.406
my bed.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.903
(shrieking)

11:00.994 --> 11:02.325
Chiana?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.619
Chiana!

11:05.707 --> 11:06.992
( snorting )

11:07.084 --> 11:08.290
Get off my bed.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.162
D'Argo!
-Yes.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.415
That filthy little
creature of yours

11:12.506 --> 11:15.873
is down in my quarters and
it's using them as a toilet.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.213
Among other things.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.262
It has to learn the environment
before it can find
the parasites.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.931
The only parasite we have is
right here, and if you don't
come and get it,

11:25.018 --> 11:26.758
I'm going to flush it
out an airlock.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.517
You're as bad as Chiana.
Just leave it alone and
let it do its job.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.982
(shrieking)

11:38.073 --> 11:40.155
D'Argo, I think it's picked up
a scent or something.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.107
Don't let it out of your sight!

11:44.121 --> 11:46.954
( rattling )

11:52.379 --> 11:53.334
Rygel?

11:57.593 --> 11:59.254
Aeryn, where are you?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.835
Tier Seven junction.
I've lost the Vorc.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.386
Dren! Where was it heading?

12:03.473 --> 12:05.464
What does it matter?
This is pointless.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.424
Do you know how dangerous
these parasites are?

12:07.519 --> 12:11.137
They suck the life out of their
prey and leave nothing but
a desiccated husk.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.392
These parasites are a fantasy.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.771
They're stories to frighten you
and Chiana into purchasing
a useless animal.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.194
Fine, fine, fine.
I will find it myself.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.817
Good. Yes. Waste your own time.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.194
Where was it heading?

12:23.285 --> 12:25.321
Towards the Maintenance Bay.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.869
Chiana:
D'Argo! D'Argo!

12:27.956 --> 12:29.617
D'Argo:
Not now, Chiana.
I'm looking for the Vorc.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.164
I'm in the Maintenance Bay
and, uh...

12:31.251 --> 12:33.287
( roaring )
there's a...

12:33.378 --> 12:37.121
there's some kind of creature
right in front of me.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.796
Chiana!

12:38.884 --> 12:40.715
Hurry!
-Get out of there, now!

12:40.802 --> 12:42.303
Yeah, I would if I could.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.547
Crichton! Aeryn!

12:43.639 --> 12:45.379
Maintenance Bay. Now!

12:47.434 --> 12:49.299
Chiana, do something.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.429
You do something.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.260
(roaring)

12:53.982 --> 12:54.892
Hey.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.519
Okay, easy.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.851
We're... we're not going to
hurt you, okay?

12:58.946 --> 13:00.231
So... so...

13:00.322 --> 13:01.437
Now slug him!

13:01.531 --> 13:02.782
We're on the way! Don't panic!

13:02.866 --> 13:04.777
I think it's a little
too late for that.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.155
Chiana!

13:11.249 --> 13:12.864
D'Argo!
-Chiana!

13:18.090 --> 13:19.751
(yelling)

13:24.638 --> 13:26.299
Huh?

13:38.235 --> 13:39.600
( labored breathing )

13:39.695 --> 13:43.279
Oh come on, Luxan. Come on.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.354
You must not die.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.565
Chiana. You okay?

13:46.660 --> 13:47.695
Yeah.

13:47.786 --> 13:48.992
Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.660
D'Argo. Rygel, what the hell
are you doing?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.032
He wasn't breathing.

13:52.124 --> 13:55.241
And I'm fine too,
thanks for asking.

13:55.335 --> 13:55.915
D'Argo.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.868
The creature you saw.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.170
The parasite.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.418
It's real.
-Yeah, I know that.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.046
Rygel:
I'm delighted you've been
vindicated, Crichton,

14:05.137 --> 14:08.470
but I'll be even happier when
you kill the frelling thing.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.172
(gasping)

14:10.267 --> 14:12.508
Whoa, whoa, whoa, D'Argo.
-D'Argo! D'Argo, what's wrong?

14:12.602 --> 14:14.513
Hold him down! Hold him!
-What's happening?

14:14.604 --> 14:17.141
ldon't know! Hold him down!
-What's wrong?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.101
Crichton:
Get Zhaan.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.103
Zhaan, get down here!

14:21.194 --> 14:22.183
D'Argo!

14:22.279 --> 14:23.519
Aeryn:
Zhaan!

14:40.255 --> 14:42.792
I don't understand what's
wrong with him.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.966
You cleansed the wound. You said
there were no internal injuries.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.964
I've done all I can do
for now, Chiana.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.263
But he appears to have some
kind of secondary infection.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.344
Like what?

14:53.435 --> 14:55.926
Like that's what I'm trying
to determine.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.386
Well, try faster.

14:57.481 --> 15:00.143
I don't need to be a healer to
see that D'Argo's getting worse.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.066
But you do need to be a healer
to make him better.

15:03.153 --> 15:06.236
Now, shut up and let me get
back to work, or leave.

15:11.203 --> 15:12.192
Crichton?

15:12.287 --> 15:14.198
D'Argo's not so good.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.199
You found the creature?

15:15.290 --> 15:17.997
No sign of it yet.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.575
It's like itjust disappeared.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.284
Hey, Aeryn!

15:43.110 --> 15:45.977
( rustling )

15:46.071 --> 15:48.153
( squeaking )

15:48.240 --> 15:51.482
(chewing)

15:51.576 --> 15:56.161
We just found your Vorc, Chiana.
-But that thing's useless.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.990
Aeryn:
Maybe not. It was heading for
the Maintenance Bay when you were attacked.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.665
I think it knew what was there.

16:00.752 --> 16:04.836
Yeah, but isn't the Vorc
supposed to kill the parasite,
not just point it out?

16:04.923 --> 16:07.630
And you think this minuscule
creature could kill something

16:07.717 --> 16:09.173
that could incapacitate D'Argo?

16:09.261 --> 16:13.049
No. But we could use it to
flush the parasite out.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.676
It could be our bird dog.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.633
( growling )
Whoa!

16:17.727 --> 16:19.809
That could be your...
uh, you bring it.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.397
I'll just, uh...

16:21.481 --> 16:23.221
I hate critters!

16:26.361 --> 16:31.071
( labored breathing )

16:32.284 --> 16:34.696
You want to tell me something?

16:37.873 --> 16:40.740
(whispering )

16:45.422 --> 16:48.334
D'Argo...

16:48.425 --> 16:51.337
You're in no condition for sex.

16:51.428 --> 16:54.511
Yeah. It might kill me, huh?

16:54.598 --> 16:57.089
(laughs, then coughs)

16:57.184 --> 16:59.470
By Khaalen!

16:59.561 --> 17:00.641
What's wrong?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.265
D'Argo's been poisoned.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.687
There's an alien toxin in
his bloodstream and it's
killing him.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.901
You can make an antidote,
can't you?

17:06.985 --> 17:09.226
ldon't know. I can...
I can try.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.215
Crichton:
Next.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.415
Next.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.089
Show me another one.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.845
I'll need a venom sample from
the creature, John.

17:40.936 --> 17:44.394
But most natural venoms
decompose rapidly when
the creature dies.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.221
We can't afford to tak
e that risk.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.353
So, it's very important that
you capture the creature
alive, and quickly.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.481
Crichton:
We're working as fast
as we can, Zhaan.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.530
Pilot, is it possible that this
critter has camouflage ability?

17:55.617 --> 17:58.859
Have you tried switching the
DRDs to heat and acoustic mode?

17:58.954 --> 18:01.195
Pilot:
Yes, and without success.

18:01.289 --> 18:05.202
The creature seems quite adept
at avoiding surveillance.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.123
Show me Cargo Bay 3.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.130
You'll never see it
coming, John.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.716
Yes.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.633
(gasping)

18:22.727 --> 18:24.308
What's going on?

18:24.396 --> 18:25.806
Get me out of here.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.139
Pilot has modified the
energy fields of Moya's
neural clusters.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.226
So, your cells will be
fortified. They'll give
you strength.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.776
(gasping)

18:33.863 --> 18:36.275
Why... why is it so
hard to breathe?

18:36.366 --> 18:38.732
The parasite's venom appears
to be designed to

18:38.827 --> 18:41.864
paralyze the nerves and
muscles of its prey.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.196
Your hearts and lungs have
been affected, D'Argo.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.701
You're early, Rygel.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.453
I'm not dead yet.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.911
But when I do die, Chiana's
going to get all of my
possessions.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.167
You always expect the
worst of me.

18:53.258 --> 18:57.843
Is it unthinkable that I might
be here simply to offer the
gift of my...

18:57.929 --> 19:00.511
company to a shipmate in need?

19:00.598 --> 19:01.428
Yes.

19:01.516 --> 19:02.676
(grunts)

19:02.767 --> 19:04.928
Are you afraid to be
alone, Rygel?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.556
I knew you'd be here.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.102
That didn't frighten me.

19:08.189 --> 19:10.271
Why should blessed solitude?

19:10.358 --> 19:11.347
Right.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.558
Now.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.143
How about this way?

19:15.238 --> 19:16.523
( squeaking )

19:18.033 --> 19:19.273
This way?

19:19.367 --> 19:21.107
Aeryn, any luck with
the Vorc yet?

19:21.202 --> 19:24.194
Oh, yes. So far, he's led me to
the cockpit of your module,

19:24.289 --> 19:28.874
a pool of amnexis fluid and
a pile of food cube crumbs.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.291
How's D'Argo?

19:30.378 --> 19:34.337
Poison's working on him.
Zhaan says it's slow but steady.

19:34.424 --> 19:37.257
No! No biting.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.131
Listen, we'll find the parasite
and I'll shoot it.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.257
Aeryn! No shooting!

19:42.349 --> 19:44.340
That's what the
sleep gas is for.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.594
I know that.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.970
Whoa!
-You got something?

19:47.062 --> 19:48.302
Well, apparently, the Vorc
thinks it does.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.227
It's getting very hard
to control.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.185
Listen to me. I'm going
to let you out.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.858
So, not too far, and
not too fast.

19:55.945 --> 19:56.980
Is that clear?

19:57.072 --> 19:58.482
(chattering wildly)

19:58.573 --> 19:59.983
Clear?

20:00.784 --> 20:02.240
( loud crash )

20:02.327 --> 20:03.487
What was that?

20:05.413 --> 20:08.200
The DRDs have located
the creature.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.251
Pilot!
-lt's in the airlock
above you, Zhaan.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.750
The creature.
It's coming for us.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.458
I'm trying to seal off the tier
to keep it confined.

20:23.390 --> 20:23.879
Pilot!

20:23.932 --> 20:24.967
Crichton!

20:25.058 --> 20:26.298
Anybody?

20:26.393 --> 20:28.759
It's moved out of the air shaft.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.309
Tier Four.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.858
I've lost contact with a DRD.

20:36.945 --> 20:37.855
(gasps )

20:56.381 --> 20:56.961
Ahh!

20:57.048 --> 20:58.254
No!

21:04.889 --> 21:06.004
Frell!

21:06.099 --> 21:08.135
Where did it go?
-Damn it, Chiana!

21:08.226 --> 21:10.842
I don't trust Aeryn to
wing that thing and
she's a good shot.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.771
We have to get it into a
confined space where the gas
grenade can do some good.

21:14.858 --> 21:17.520
What'd you expect me to use?
Harsh language?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.111
That was a warning shot.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.447
Yeah, well ten is more
than a warning.
Pilot, we lost it.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.988
I know what I'm doing, okay?
I didn't ask you to come
along and I don't...

21:24.075 --> 21:28.535
Shh! Chiana, go back to D'Argo
and give him a reason to live.

21:29.414 --> 21:30.654
And do what?

21:30.748 --> 21:33.125
What, sit by him and
watch him die?

21:33.209 --> 21:36.326
This is the only way I know
how to help him.

21:36.421 --> 21:40.380
The creature is on Tier Three,
hamman side and moving rapidly.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.798
It's heading for Command!

21:41.885 --> 21:43.967
Pilot! Seal off the exits!

21:50.977 --> 21:54.310
Done. The creature has
no way out.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.186
Do it?

21:59.277 --> 22:00.141
Armed.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.100
Ready.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.061
Pilot, open sesame.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.248
It couldn't have gotten out.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.203
Could it?

22:20.298 --> 22:22.505
Shut up and keep searching.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.636
(growling)

22:35.730 --> 22:37.686
Crichton:
Not now.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.685
Crichton.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.313
What's the matter?
-Nothing. I'm fine.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.189
He's got to be around
here somewhere.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.830
Chiana.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.750
Chiana:
Ah, frell.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.088
The Vorc.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.754
He must have chased the
creature in here.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.297
So where is it?

23:05.385 --> 23:08.218
( squeaking )

23:10.265 --> 23:12.005
Why don't you show us.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.182
Come on. Show us the parasite.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.304
(growling)

23:26.990 --> 23:28.230
(roaring)

23:28.324 --> 23:29.780
Grenades.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.242
(hissing)

23:41.212 --> 23:43.043
That thing was the
Vorc all along?

23:43.131 --> 23:45.873
Wait a minute. Are you saying
the Vorc is the parasite?

23:45.967 --> 23:51.178
The only thing I know for
certain is that you
brought it on board.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.880
How was I supposed to know?

23:53.975 --> 23:55.715
Crichton:
Girls, quit the sniping.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.051
Zhaan needs a venom sample.

24:07.196 --> 24:10.279
All right, what do you mean,
there's no venom?
-I can't find any.

24:10.366 --> 24:14.985
There's no trace of any toxin
whatsoever in any of the samples
I took from that creature.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.785
You must have missed
something then.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.829
I checked down to its
hair follicles.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.781
I tried every technique I know.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.243
I'm sure that didn't take long.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.999
Shut up, Rygel.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.625
There has to be another
explanation.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.581
Well perhaps it's only
poisonous in its other form.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.962
lt attacked D'Argo in its
present form.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.761
Aeryn:
Besides, it bit me when it was
small, and I'm fine.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.930
Then the poison had to come
from somewhere.

24:36.017 --> 24:39.305
Pilot, how long would it take
us to get back to where we
bought this damn thing?

24:39.395 --> 24:44.059
At maximum speed Moya could
reach the planet in less
than 32 arns.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.233
D'Argo won't make it.
His respiration is failing.

24:47.320 --> 24:51.359
The field in the neural cluster
won't sustain him much longer.

24:54.369 --> 24:57.111
The thing that attacked
me was the Vorc.

24:57.205 --> 24:59.947
Zhaan's getting a venom sample
from it now.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.666
You're gonna be fine.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.630
Don't lie to me.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.926
I brought the frelling
thing on board.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.844
This is all my fault, D'Argo.

25:18.935 --> 25:24.146
You didn't bring him here.
We both did.

25:24.232 --> 25:26.188
Crichton:
All right, riddle me this.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.527
Because we think we may have
parasites on board,
we get a Vorc,

25:28.611 --> 25:31.398
cause someone tells us that
Vorcs kill parasites.

25:31.489 --> 25:34.481
And all of a sudden, this other
critter shows up, this
Ewok gone bad.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.486
Bites D'Argo,
poisons him, yeah?

25:36.577 --> 25:38.533
So we capture the parasite,

25:38.621 --> 25:42.159
and surprise, the parasite and
the Vorc are the same thing,

25:42.250 --> 25:43.911
but neither one of them
is poisonous.

25:44.001 --> 25:49.166
So, for $10,000 and the
Caribbean cruise, what
poisoned D'Argo?

25:49.257 --> 25:51.293
Something else must have.
-Yes.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.375
You're suggesting there's
another creature on board.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.209
Yes, the real parasite.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.044
What if the Vorc is working
as advertised?

25:57.140 --> 25:59.631
It's hunting the parasite,
but it's doing it in two
different forms?

25:59.726 --> 26:04.846
Smaller, faster form for
tracking, a larger, more
powerful form for attack.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.270
Exactly.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.734
Why did it attack Chiana
and D'Argo?

26:08.818 --> 26:11.104
I don't know. Maybe they scared
it, threatened it somehow.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.981
You know, D'Argo has that
effect on everything.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.233
Aeryn:
Even if this real
parasite exists,

26:15.324 --> 26:19.738
which I'm still not convinced
it does, we have no idea
what it is.

26:19.829 --> 26:24.038
Is it an insect,
a microorganism, another
creature like this?

26:24.125 --> 26:25.615
I don't know.
Why don't you ask it?

26:25.710 --> 26:27.200
Oh, that's very good, Crichton.

26:27.295 --> 26:29.081
I know my translator microbes
are working,

26:29.172 --> 26:31.959
because deranged as it always
is, I do understand what
you're saying.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.335
But this creature can only
grunt and growl.
It cannot talk.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.258
No, Aeryn, this is a good idea.

26:36.345 --> 26:40.008
Why don't we see if we can get
the incredible Vorc here to
understand us?

26:41.517 --> 26:44.884
D'Argo is dying.
You got a better idea,
lay it on me.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.890
( creature growling )

26:49.400 --> 26:51.482
(whimpering)

26:54.572 --> 26:56.358
All right, Pilot, shoot him up.

26:56.449 --> 26:59.191
Injecting translator microbes.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.946
( screams )

27:02.079 --> 27:04.786
Hey, over here. Listen up.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.410
You understand me?

27:06.501 --> 27:09.334
We just want to talk to you.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.876
This is a waste of time,
Crichton.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.703
Translator microbes don't
take this long to work.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.290
Let's take it to Zhaan.
She can dissect it, see if
she missed something.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.043
Dissect it?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.341
Yeah, I say we kill it.

27:17.428 --> 27:19.339
(yelling)

27:22.225 --> 27:23.761
Aeryn, it understands what
you're saying.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.057
Take it back.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.226
Take it back.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.396
Hello.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.193
I'm sorry.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.657
ldon't want to kill you.

27:38.741 --> 27:41.699
That was terrible.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.196
That was... that was...

27:43.287 --> 27:46.745
look, Lassie here is trying
to communicate with us.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.119
Yeah, and I don't
understand you.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.165
Pilot:
Officer Sun...

27:50.253 --> 27:53.165
I believe it's asking why.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.668
Pilot, you understand him?
-Somewhat.

27:55.758 --> 28:01.378
Because of my bond with Moya I
am, accustomed to nonverbal
communication.

28:01.472 --> 28:06.091
While I don't believe this
creature has language in
a true sense,

28:06.185 --> 28:11.521
it seems to be expressing
itself in a mixture of
simple concepts,

28:11.607 --> 28:15.191
sensations and instinctual
reactions.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.394
Keep translating.

28:18.155 --> 28:23.320
"Why... pain... me?"

28:23.411 --> 28:27.745
Well, we hurt you because
you hurt us.

28:27.832 --> 28:31.700
Why did you attack D'Argo?

28:31.794 --> 28:33.580
Our friend?

28:33.671 --> 28:35.252
Friend.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.333
"Attack. . ."

28:37.425 --> 28:38.961
"Defend."

28:39.051 --> 28:40.757
D'Argo attacked you first?

28:42.847 --> 28:44.132
"Friend."

28:44.599 --> 28:46.510
"Friend."

28:46.601 --> 28:49.058
It keeps repeating "friend."

28:50.313 --> 28:53.305
In the Command. It showed us
it could change shapes.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.481
It wasn't trying to hurt us.

28:55.568 --> 28:56.808
No.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.393
What do you want?

28:58.487 --> 29:00.193
(chattering )

29:00.281 --> 29:03.865
"Bad... danger... here."

29:03.951 --> 29:05.782
There's a parasite on board?

29:06.454 --> 29:09.537
Are you the parasite?

29:09.624 --> 29:12.161
The answer to that is "no."
Who's going to say yes to that?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.991
That is no.
-Clarifying.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.122
Can you help us find
the parasite?

29:17.423 --> 29:20.085
"Hunt... the bad."

29:20.509 --> 29:22.374
"Kill the bad."

29:23.179 --> 29:25.511
"Free. Kill the bad."

29:25.598 --> 29:30.638
Right. 80 you want us to
free you, so you can
kill the parasite.

29:30.728 --> 29:32.719
That's a better question.
Clarification.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.099
And that's a "yes."

29:35.191 --> 29:37.853
Do you trust it?
-I don't know.

29:37.944 --> 29:41.311
We could have it describe the
parasite to us and we could
find it ourselves.

29:41.405 --> 29:45.239
Who knows how long that could
take? D'Argo doesn't have that
much time to spare.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.192
You're right.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.697
Hey, little fella.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.280
We're going to roll the dice.

29:52.375 --> 29:56.584
But you make one wrong move,
I will shoot you.

29:56.671 --> 29:58.536
You understand shoot?

29:58.631 --> 29:59.996
Ka-tow, ka-tow, ka-tow.

30:00.091 --> 30:01.297
Little bolts of light.

30:01.384 --> 30:02.999
Ouch.

30:03.094 --> 30:05.005
( sniffing )

30:07.431 --> 30:09.683
Here we go again.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.349
Pilot, can you dial down Moya's
atmospheric scrubbers?

30:12.436 --> 30:14.688
It might enhance whatever this
little guy's sniffing.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.728
Reducing scrubbers now.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.148
Crichton, have you taken
leave of your senses?

30:19.235 --> 30:22.227
I don't expect much from
Aeryn, but you...

30:22.321 --> 30:23.561
Relax, Sparky. We're on it.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.271
I saw what it did to D'Argo.

30:25.366 --> 30:28.108
If it comes near me,
I'll kill it, I swear.

30:28.202 --> 30:33.322
Lock yourself in your room and
do whatever the hell it is you
do in there by yourself.

30:34.542 --> 30:35.998
Crichton...

30:39.922 --> 30:41.503
(roaring)

30:41.590 --> 30:45.674
Hey, hey! We had a deal!
You were supposed to
lead us to it.

30:45.761 --> 30:50.926
Pilot, I demand that you fuel a
Transport Pod and make it ready
for departure this microt.

30:51.017 --> 30:54.930
Rygel, I told you,
my DRDs are occupied.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.262
I cannot help you now.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.391
(roaring)

30:58.482 --> 30:59.858
(gasps )

31:02.903 --> 31:04.029
Help!

31:04.113 --> 31:06.274
Anybody, help!

31:08.409 --> 31:09.819
Rygel?

31:10.286 --> 31:11.116
Rygel?

31:11.203 --> 31:13.535
Are you there?
Rygel?!

31:13.622 --> 31:15.158
It's not after you, Rygel.
It's after the parasite.

31:15.249 --> 31:17.615
Just keep moving!
Get out of the area.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.166
It's closing in.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.618
I can hear it.

31:24.633 --> 31:28.296
Crichton, you said I'd
be safe. You said...

31:33.017 --> 31:34.882
Rygel, don't move.

31:41.442 --> 31:44.184
( muffled growl )

31:44.278 --> 31:46.519
Rygel is your friend.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.570
Rygel, tell him you're
his friend.

31:49.450 --> 31:51.281
Yotz.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.405
Kill it.
-No. Friend.

31:55.289 --> 31:57.154
Kill it.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.036
Rygel, it's probably not
after you.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.334
It's just looking for
a gopher lead.

32:04.924 --> 32:05.834
Huh?

32:10.096 --> 32:11.506
Now slow.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.301
Rygel:
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

32:19.021 --> 32:21.387
(growling)

32:25.236 --> 32:27.272
No, get off him!
-No, Rygel, get off him!

32:27.363 --> 32:28.819
No!

32:38.165 --> 32:40.201
(gasping)

32:40.292 --> 32:42.874
Help me.

32:53.264 --> 32:55.676
(gasping in pain)

32:55.766 --> 32:58.553
Can't move.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.555
So cold.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.388
Body... feels... broken.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.603
Rygel, you're going into shock.

33:06.694 --> 33:09.276
Zhaan says you have
internal injuries.

33:09.864 --> 33:11.604
Your fault.

33:11.699 --> 33:15.908
You let that thing
do this to me.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.155
Sparky...

33:17.246 --> 33:20.238
Sparky, just... shut up.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.199
Try and stay calm.

33:23.294 --> 33:25.285
He's been poisoned.
-What?

33:25.379 --> 33:28.246
Zhaan:
There were massive traces of
toxins in Rygel's wound,

33:28.340 --> 33:30.251
the same compounds I
found in D'Argo.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.207
Crichton:
Zhaan, we had the Vorc
in our hands.

33:32.303 --> 33:34.089
You said it wasn't poisonous.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.011
I made a mistake.

33:36.098 --> 33:40.808
lfl bring it in dead, is there
any possibility that you can
make an anti-venom?

33:40.895 --> 33:42.601
Zhaan:
Well, it's possible.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.395
There's nothing I can do for
Rygel and D'Argo without it.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.393
Well, one way or the other.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.475
You're getting it, okay?

33:49.570 --> 33:50.810
Yeah.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.067
Can he talk?

33:54.158 --> 33:55.944
I don't know.

33:58.329 --> 33:59.910
How you doing?

33:59.997 --> 34:02.158
(gasping weakly)

34:02.249 --> 34:05.912
Find my son. Find my son.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.789
We'll find him together.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.964
You take care of him.

34:32.947 --> 34:35.313
Blood. I knew we hit it.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.318
Yeah, hide from me now, friend.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.149
When we see him, he's mine.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.701
We'll see.

34:48.212 --> 34:50.578
Aah! What the frell
was that for?

34:52.508 --> 34:54.419
It was nothin'.
Just clearing my head.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.588
(roaring)

34:57.680 --> 34:58.965
Crichton!

35:01.183 --> 35:02.514
Do you see any blood?

35:02.601 --> 35:03.886
No.
-All right...

35:03.978 --> 35:05.138
That way.
-That way.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.810
Aeryn! No, no, no.
We are not splitting up.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.309
We're running out of time.
We don't have another choice.

35:14.822 --> 35:15.982
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

35:16.073 --> 35:17.483
That thing just gave
us the slip.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.360
Why would it come back for us
unless it was leading us...

35:19.451 --> 35:21.737
...into a trap. What else?

35:21.829 --> 35:23.820
Right. As long as we both know.

35:28.085 --> 35:29.791
(growling)

35:33.090 --> 35:34.796
(growling)

35:45.686 --> 35:47.472
(growling)

35:48.731 --> 35:50.221
(growling)

35:54.320 --> 35:55.856
(growling soft)

36:16.342 --> 36:18.458
Better get it back to Zhaan.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.167
Crichton:
Aeryn...

36:20.262 --> 36:22.048
what is that?

36:57.216 --> 36:59.958
Can you say... "cocoon"?

37:02.638 --> 37:07.052
Zhaan:
Chiana said the parasites
leave cocoons behind.

37:07.142 --> 37:11.260
Aeryn, it led us here
to see this.

37:13.816 --> 37:15.681
(growling)

37:24.868 --> 37:26.529
Crichton:
Holy body snatchers.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.201
Start talking.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.126
( growling softly)

37:39.967 --> 37:44.176
That frelling thing went
through my mouth.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.174
Could barely frelling breathe.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.301
Strands pouring out of me.

37:48.392 --> 37:53.261
Through my ears, nose, my
pores, every frelling
hole in my body.

37:53.355 --> 37:59.316
Form... formed this cocoon
around me to feed to its
frelling offspring.

37:59.403 --> 38:03.237
Imagine me, food for
something else!

38:03.323 --> 38:05.530
It took my shape,
and then it...

38:05.617 --> 38:07.869
How do I know you're Rygel?

38:09.621 --> 38:13.205
(farting sound)

38:18.172 --> 38:20.538
( in a high-pitched voice)
Where are you going?

38:21.425 --> 38:23.290
(whimpering)

38:24.219 --> 38:26.005
Zhaan, get out of there now!

38:26.096 --> 38:29.008
Crichton:
It's not Rygel!
It's the parasite!

38:29.099 --> 38:30.179
(growling)

38:30.893 --> 38:32.349
(vicious yell)

38:34.021 --> 38:35.352
( screaming )

38:36.482 --> 38:38.347
No, Rygel!

38:39.735 --> 38:41.350
(both yelling)

38:42.237 --> 38:43.443
Help!

38:46.283 --> 38:47.193
Ryg?

38:48.577 --> 38:49.942
(yells)

39:04.801 --> 39:06.302
( high-pitched chattering )

39:12.809 --> 39:14.470
Cover me!

39:34.373 --> 39:36.329
( sizzling )

39:46.468 --> 39:48.174
(crunching)

39:51.223 --> 39:53.384
What the frell is that?

39:53.475 --> 39:55.557
Both:
Sorry about the mess.

40:03.277 --> 40:09.648
That parasite was hiding in a
crate of marjools I was
inspecting in the cargo bay.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.901
( shudders )

40:10.993 --> 40:12.608
A hideous experience.

40:12.703 --> 40:16.571
It was actually feeding off
my essence, my thoughts.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.452
And it would have done the
same to all of you.

40:19.543 --> 40:22.250
I remember Rygel...
uh, the other one...

40:22.337 --> 40:24.453
standing over me after
I was wounded.

40:24.548 --> 40:28.291
That parasite was going to use
you next. Why didn't it?

40:28.385 --> 40:32.879
I suspect it tried but D'Argo's
reaction to the venom
was so strong,

40:32.973 --> 40:35.214
it didn't have enough time
to complete its task.

40:35.309 --> 40:39.473
How could you of all been
so stupid to let that
thing fool you?

40:39.563 --> 40:42.100
It was a perfect copy
of you, Rygel.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.272
Ha! Perfect?

40:44.359 --> 40:47.101
Perhaps to undiscerning
observers like yourselves.

40:47.195 --> 40:51.780
Fortunately, that courageous
Vorc was here to rescue me.

40:54.995 --> 40:56.110
Pilot?

40:56.204 --> 41:00.994
He... says he's happy.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.665
Is there anything we
can do to help?

41:02.753 --> 41:06.871
Pilot:
I don't think the creature
understands the concept.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.422
(weak, high-pitched sounds)

41:10.719 --> 41:12.255
"End..."

41:13.263 --> 41:14.423
"End..."

41:16.224 --> 41:20.593
He knows his time is near.

41:23.273 --> 41:26.811
lam so...

41:26.902 --> 41:30.269
so sorry.

41:30.364 --> 41:33.401
(weak, high-pitched sounds)

41:36.453 --> 41:39.991
( gasps softly)

42:18.286 --> 42:21.153
Crichton when we were hunting,

42:21.248 --> 42:24.615
you, uh... almost blew
my head off.

42:24.710 --> 42:27.167
That was a bad shot,
even for you.

42:27.254 --> 42:28.619
Yeah.

42:30.549 --> 42:33.211
What's your point?

42:33.301 --> 42:36.168
What were you firing at, really?

42:41.727 --> 42:45.345
I've been ah, having these...

42:45.439 --> 42:47.600
well, I wouldn't exactly call
them hallucinations.

42:47.691 --> 42:50.307
I've been having these...

42:50.402 --> 42:52.643
flashes of Scorpius.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.478
Flashes? Like memories?

42:54.573 --> 42:55.779
No, they're not memories.

42:55.866 --> 42:58.653
It's more like he's
talking to me.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.406
You ever been in a crowded room,

43:01.496 --> 43:04.784
and everybody's talking all
at the same time so you
can't hear anybody.

43:04.875 --> 43:08.413
And suddenly, someone says your
name and then... (snaps)

43:08.503 --> 43:13.122
like crystal, you hear
every word they say.

43:13.216 --> 43:17.129
No matter how far away they
are it's like they're
talking only to you.

43:20.348 --> 43:22.680
What is Scorpius saying to you?

43:25.103 --> 43:27.515
He says he's gonna get me.

43:27.606 --> 43:31.064
Says he already has,
I just don't know it yet.

43:31.151 --> 43:34.393
Why didn't you kill him when
you had the chance?

43:35.655 --> 43:37.270
I tried.

43:38.450 --> 43:40.532
I tried.

43:40.619 --> 43:43.281
But I couldn't.
Something stopped me.

43:44.164 --> 43:46.200
Something inside.

43:49.002 --> 43:50.208
Crichton, if you need help...

43:50.295 --> 43:52.502
I'll ask.

43:52.589 --> 43:54.420
Just like you do.

43:56.218 --> 43:57.628
Aeryn, don't worry.

43:57.719 --> 43:59.505
(laughing)

43:59.596 --> 44:02.303
I'm not gonna lose my mind.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.551
It's all I've got left.

44:10.065 --> 44:11.350
All right.

44:24.371 --> 44:27.863
Scorpius (whispering ):
You'll never see it
coming, John.

44:27.958 --> 44:31.416
When the trap closes,
it will be too late.

44:31.503 --> 44:33.209
You think?

44:42.180 --> 44:44.136
Checkmate.

44:44.224 --> 44:46.010
You lose.

44:52.274 --> 44:54.515
That, um...

44:54.609 --> 44:56.861
wasn't the trap that I meant.

44:56.945 --> 44:58.310
Hmm...
